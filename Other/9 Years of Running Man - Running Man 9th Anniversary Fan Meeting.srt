- I hope we can pull this off.<b>- I know.</b>

178
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,990
You might become disappointed today.

179
00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:38,780
- We'll do our best.<b>- You might become disappointed.</b>

180
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:40,660
Nang only gives compliments.

181
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:41,690
- Really?<b>- Yes.</b>

182
00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:42,820
He does that even if you are bad.

183
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:44,120
- Really?<b>- Yes.</b>

184
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:46,090
I have low expectations.

185
00:25:46,090 --> 00:25:48,670
I take what I can<b>in a short amount of time.</b>

186
00:25:48,670 --> 00:25:51,470
Did you compliment us in the past<b>to take what you could?</b>

187
00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:53,360
I didn't mean that.

188
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,030
I complimented you in the past<b>because you did a good job.</b>

189
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:58,240
- I am glad we met a good teacher.<b>- Seriously.</b>

190
00:25:58,270 --> 00:26:01,570
I want to say that<b>please do not give up on us.</b>

191
00:26:01,570 --> 00:26:03,180
I will make it work.

192
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:05,650
- If the notes become mushy...<b>- "Mushy"?</b>

193
00:26:05,650 --> 00:26:07,880
(His tongue gets twisted already.)

194
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:09,720
(You'll tune our recording<b>with the computer, right?)</b>

195
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,850
He is the repair shop<b>of the music industry.</b>

196
00:26:11,850 --> 00:26:13,080
(Don't worry because Nang is<b>a veteran composer.)</b>

197
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,730
- Should we decide on a team name?<b>- That's right.</b>

198
00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:16,490
- The others already made theirs.<b>- That's right.</b>

199
00:26:16,490 --> 00:26:17,730
What should we use?

200
00:26:17,730 --> 00:26:19,820
Since our last names<b>are Lee and Jee,</b>

201
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:21,400
we go by LeeJee Brothers.

202
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,930
Then we could be Pink LeeJee.

203
00:26:22,930 --> 00:26:24,330
(Then we could be Pink LeeJee.)

204
00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:26,330
- Pink LeeJee.<b>- Pink LeeJee.</b>

205
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:27,470
It's cute.

206
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:28,710
Pink Nosebleed.

207
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:30,800
- Pink Nosebleed?<b>- Pink Nosebleed?</b>

208
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,530
You are "Pink",<b>he is "Nose", and I am "Bleed"?</b>

209
00:26:32,530 --> 00:26:34,180
You don't want that name.

210
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:35,300
(If not Pink LeeJee<b>or Pink Nosebleed...)</b>

211
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:37,070
I think Pink Nose Light<b>would be good.</b>

212
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:38,720
- Pink Nose Light.<b>- Pink Nose Light.</b>

213
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,450
- "Kwang" means "Light".<b>- Pink Nose Light.</b>

214
00:26:40,450 --> 00:26:42,380
- Pink Nose Light.<b>- It's a good one.</b>

215
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:44,350
- Pink Nose Light is cute.<b>- It's a good one.</b>

216
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:46,580
- We are Pink Nose Light.<b>- Pink Nose Light.</b>

217
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:47,990
(They decided on Pink Nose Light.)

218
00:26:48,050 --> 00:26:50,350
- Shall we listen to the song?<b>- Yes.</b>

219
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:54,170
(We are going to party)

220
00:26:54,170 --> 00:26:56,090
(I like that)

221
00:26:56,090 --> 00:26:57,530
(He sings passionately.)

222
00:26:57,530 --> 00:26:59,000
(I like that.)

223
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,010
It suits him.

224
00:27:00,010 --> 00:27:02,100
(He is good.)

225
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:04,270
It sounds like he is singing<b>the guide track.</b>

226
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:07,650
(He gets more excited.)

227
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:09,650
We should record the song now.

228
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:14,950
(Humming)

229
00:27:15,310 --> 00:27:17,310
(He's still better than expected.)

230
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:18,990
- He is so good.<b>- It's your part.</b>

231
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,580
<i>Gather around right now</i>

232
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,320
(Gather around! Right now!)

233
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:27,320
(That's incredible.)

234
00:27:29,930 --> 00:27:31,940
(Suk Jin and Kwang Soo are good.)

235
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:34,560
(The enthusiastic response<b>gives them confidence.)</b>

236
00:27:35,670 --> 00:27:37,410
- The song is really nice.<b>- I know.</b>

237
00:27:37,410 --> 00:27:39,410
- It's refreshing.<b>- It's refreshing.</b>

238
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,710
- You are good.<b>- Until the sun rises</b>

239
00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:41,980
(The compliments excite them.)

240
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:45,270
Eun Ji, warm up your throat first.

241
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:46,340
Okay.

242
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:48,720
(The main vocalist of Apink,<b>Eun Ji warms up her throat.)</b>

243
00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:51,660
(When the sun sets)

244
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:53,820
(When the stars rise)

245
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,620
(Baby, baby, right here)

246
00:27:57,730 --> 00:27:59,500
(Impressed)

247
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:02,930
- My goodness.<b>- Her voice suits the song.</b>

248
00:28:02,930 --> 00:28:04,500
- Her voice suits the song.<b>- Gosh, it's so nice.</b>

249
00:28:04,670 --> 00:28:07,530
- He always does that.<b>- That's right.</b>

250
00:28:07,530 --> 00:28:08,860
- That's his style.<b>- Nang.</b>

251
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:10,180
(Nang's compliment<b>makes Eun Ji embarrassed.)</b>

252
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:12,940
- It was okay, right?<b>- It was really nice.</b>

253
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:16,100
(Baby, baby, right here)

254
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:18,150
- That's good. We are set.<b>- Are we set?</b>

255
00:28:18,150 --> 00:28:20,610
- That's good.<b>- Goodness.</b>

256
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:23,020
(Eun Ji's recording<b>goes without a hitch.)</b>

257
00:28:24,810 --> 00:28:27,190
- It's nice. It's nice, but...<b>- Okay.</b>

258
00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:30,500
He says "It's nice" first.<b>That's how he always starts off.</b>

259
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,430
It seemed like he was angry.

260
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:34,270
"It's nice, but..."

261
00:28:35,270 --> 00:28:36,270
It's not like that.

262
00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:37,440
Good!

263
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:40,210
Gosh, it's nice.

264
00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:41,300
(It means he likes it so much<b>that he is going crazy.)</b>

265
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:44,240
- Nang.<b>- That's his style.</b>

266
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,950
- I am gaining confidence.<b>- I know.</b>

267
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:48,840
- Seeing Nang gives me confidence.<b>- I know.</b>

268
00:28:49,150 --> 00:28:52,150
- Kwang Soo. I feel nervous in here.<b>- Yes?</b>

269
00:28:52,150 --> 00:28:54,580
- Please sing comfortably.<b>- Good luck.</b>

270
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:56,520
- It's Suk Jin's turn.<b>- I can't wait.</b>

271
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:59,050
(He pulled off the intro perfectly<b>a moment ago.)</b>

272
00:28:59,050 --> 00:29:01,580
(We are going to party)

273
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:02,580
(That...)

274
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:05,460
(We are going to party)

275
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:08,020
(He missed the beat.)

276
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:09,770
Let's start over.

277
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:12,090
(They burst out laughing.)

278
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,710
It's nice. It's nice.<b>It's very nice.</b>

279
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:16,910
He will lose his confidence.

280
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:18,410
- It's nice.<b>- When that happens,</b>

281
00:29:18,410 --> 00:29:20,450
his back becomes hunched.

282
00:29:20,450 --> 00:29:21,710
He will soon sing like this.

283
00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:22,910
(He did a good job earlier.)

284
00:29:23,450 --> 00:29:25,340
I am nervous.

285
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:27,580
- Good luck.<b>- Please sing comfortably.</b>

286
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:29,920
(With Apink's support,<b>his 2nd attempt begins.)</b>

287
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:34,160
(I like that)

288
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,850
I am less nervous now.

289
00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:40,520
Oh, yes.

290
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:44,090
Your vocalization became freer.

291
00:29:44,090 --> 00:29:46,270
(How about this?)

292
00:29:46,770 --> 00:29:49,770
(That's incredible!)

293
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:52,510
That's incredible.

294
00:29:54,150 --> 00:29:56,710
I don't know if we're complimenting<b>or making fun of him.</b>

295
00:29:56,710 --> 00:29:58,570
- We're complimenting him, right?<b>- Yes.</b>

296
00:29:59,150 --> 00:30:01,720
- Let's warm up your throat first.<b>- Okay.</b>

297
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:10,460
(Until today<b>becomes tomorrow morning)</b>

298
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:11,590
(My goodness!)

299
00:30:12,090 --> 00:30:13,860
(They cheer loudly.)

300
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:15,900
- It wasn't half bad.<b>- Bravo.</b>

301
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:17,860
He is happy. He is happy.

302
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:20,030
He is happy.

303
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:21,710
Stop it!

304
00:30:22,910 --> 00:30:25,530
If we tease him too much,<b>he will catch on.</b>

305
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,540
It's nice.

306
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:29,340
- It's nice, right?<b>- Yes.</b>

307
00:30:29,770 --> 00:30:32,270
(Pink Nose Light<b>sings "Party" together.)</b>

308

(The song that will welcome<b>the refreshing breeze of fall...)</b>

309

(will be revealed soon.)

310
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:40,430

(Bomi does a random dance<b>and wraps up the situation.)</b>

318
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:59,600
Here is the important thing.

319
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:00,980
You shouldn't dance to the beat.

320
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:04,680
Don't dance to the beat.<b>Dance however you want.</b>

321
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:07,190
It will be better that way.

322
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:08,920
(Bomi's offbeat<b>and random dance begins.)</b>

323
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:10,280
(Laughing)

324
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:14,350
(How about this dance?)

328

- Shall we begin?<b>- All the best. Let's begin.</b>

329

Kwang Soo. Do you know the part...

330
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:41,520
- you have to go to the back?<b>- Yes.</b>

Please look forward as the camera<b>will focus on you at that time.</b>

332
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,160
Okay.

333
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:47,730
Okay. Let's go.

(All he has to do is look forward<b>when he goes to the back!)</b>

337
00:32:06,410 --> 00:32:09,010
(He bumped into someone else.)

338
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:11,840
(He immediately carries her.)

339
00:32:12,870 --> 00:32:15,040
(I'm doomed.)

00:35:56,770 --> 00:35:57,900
My goodness.

351
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:59,070
(Kwang Soo's parents<b>are proud of him.)</b>

352
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:01,300
I practiced so much, but I made<b>a mistake during our performance.</b>

353
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,780
I was very nervous.

354
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:05,170
I was supposed to do this,<b>but I danced like this instead.</b>

355
00:36:05,170 --> 00:36:06,210
(He suddenly did the hula dance.)

356
00:36:06,210 --> 00:36:09,110
That was how I danced.<b>Everybody, We are...</b>

357
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:10,650
- Pink.<b>- Pink.</b>

358
00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:11,710
- Nose.<b>- Nose.</b>

359
00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:13,020
- Light.<b>- Light.</b>

360
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:14,030
I'm sorry.

361
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:15,030
(He immediately gives up<b>and apologizes.)</b>

362
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:17,920
(Pink Nose Light, the group that's<b>better at performing than singing.)</b>

363
00:36:18,590 --> 00:36:20,570
(But it's okay.)

364
00:36:20,570 --> 00:36:23,030
We tried our best<b>to not cause any trouble...</b>

365
00:36:23,030 --> 00:36:24,400
- for Apink.<b>- Don't say that.</b>

366
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,000
But I'm not sure if I did well.

367
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:28,670
I was worried. How was it?

368
00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:31,480
For the past eight years,

369
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:33,610
I have been the oldest member<b>of my team.</b>

370
00:36:33,610 --> 00:36:37,320
It's my first time<b>to not be the oldest after 8 years.</b>

371
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,380
- I see.<b>- That made me happy.</b>

372
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:41,150
It's not easy to have someone<b>his age as the oldest member.</b>

373
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:42,420
- Obviously.<b>- Yes, that's right.</b>

374
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:45,960
The first time<b>we were announced as one team,</b>

375
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:49,980
I was even prepared<b>to carry him while I dance.</b>

376
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:52,650
You are far<b>from being the oldest member...</b>

377
00:36:52,650 --> 00:36:55,000
- since I am part of this team.<b>- Thank you.</b>

378
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,800
Thank you very much.<b>We will now introduce the next team.</b>

379
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:01,230
- Se Chan is now a hip hop artist.<b>- Yes, he is.</b>

380
00:37:01,770 --> 00:37:04,480
(DJ Ssaebssaeb is ready<b>to take the stage.)</b>

381
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:10,340
The next team members<b>are Song Ji Hyo, Yang Se Chan,</b>

382
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,280
and Nucksal!

383
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:14,050
(Next up are Ji Hyo, Se Chan,<b>and Nucksal.)</b>

384
00:37:14,050 --> 00:37:16,980
As well as Code Kunst.

385
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:18,050
(Next up are Ji Hyo, Se Chan,<b>Nucksal and Code Kunst.)</b>

386
00:37:18,190 --> 00:37:20,780
I heard a rumor that...

387
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:24,230
someone great will be joining them.<b>They have a hidden card.</b>

388
00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:27,000
- They have a hidden card?<b>- Look forward to their performance.</b>

389
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
(Who is their hidden card?)

390
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,400
Everybody!

391
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:32,530
Are you ready to have fun?

392
00:37:32,530 --> 00:37:34,430
Yes!

393
00:37:34,430 --> 00:37:36,530
Make some noise!

394
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:42,470
We, Pink Nose Light,<b>will now leave the stage.</b>

395
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:43,570
- Let's do it for the last time.<b>- Okay.</b>

396
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:46,650
We'll say goodbye for now.<b>We are...</b>

397
00:37:46,650 --> 00:37:47,780
- Pink.<b>- Pink.</b>

398
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:48,950
- Nose.<b>- Nose.</b>

399
00:37:48,950 --> 00:37:51,760
- Light.<b>- Light.</b>

400
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:54,950
- Thank you.<b>- Thank you.</b>

401
00:37:55,130 --> 00:37:56,880

402

(Yang Se Chan)

403
00:37:58,530 --> 00:38:02,700
(Hyo Chan Park,<b>Running Man 9th Anniversary Project)</b>

404
00:38:04,070 --> 00:38:05,570
We'll soon begin our recording.

405
00:38:05,990 --> 00:38:07,130
(They are nervous as they're about<b>to start recording their song.)</b>

406
00:38:07,130 --> 00:38:08,200
My gosh.

407
00:38:08,470 --> 00:38:10,170
(A deep sigh)

408
00:38:10,930 --> 00:38:12,930
I think you're just pretending<b>to be nervous although you're not.</b>

409
00:38:13,030 --> 00:38:15,240
Why would you be nervous?

410
00:38:15,950 --> 00:38:16,970
Okay. Let's see.

411
00:38:17,610 --> 00:38:20,380
Before we begin our recording,<b>you should listen to the guide...</b>

412
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:22,090
- and then you can start.<b>- Okay.</b>

413
00:38:22,090 --> 00:38:25,860
Our main director for today<b>is Dr. Co.</b>

414
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:26,920
I am very picky.

415
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:28,760
Please be more mindful<b>since he's very picky.</b>

416
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:31,030
No matter how good you are,<b>you'll at least do it thrice.</b>

417
00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:32,720
(He's warning them in advance.)

418
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:34,990
(They are trembling in fear.)

419
00:38:34,990 --> 00:38:37,170
I should mess up<b>the first three tries then.</b>

420
00:38:37,170 --> 00:38:38,760
(Se Chan plans<b>to mess up the first three trials.)</b>

421
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:40,760
(You plan to mess it up?)

422
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:42,360
(He's singing nonsense.)

423
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:43,510
Okay. If you do that...

424
00:38:43,510 --> 00:38:45,380
(Hyo Chan Park<b>will be disbanded right away.)</b>

425
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:48,900
- Okay. Please leave.<b>- No. I won't do that.</b>

426
00:38:49,050 --> 00:38:50,050
Let's start recording.

427
00:38:50,050 --> 00:38:52,220
- Se Chan, you may go in.<b>- Okay.</b>

428
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:53,720
You may go in, Se Chan.

429
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:54,720
(Se Chan<b>will start recording first.)</b>

430
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:55,780
Okay.

431
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:57,680
(He warms up his voice first<b>and starts immediately.)</b>

432
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:00,880
Increase the volume. Tension...<b>Why is this beeping?</b>

433
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,150
(He's asking<b>why is the headset beeping.)</b>

434
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:03,650
What's wrong with that?<b>It happened last time too.</b>

435
00:39:03,650 --> 00:39:05,550
Am I being arrogant? Should I just<b>continue despite the beeping sound?</b>

436
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:07,320
- You're right.<b>- I'll just do it. I'm sorry.</b>

437
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:08,630
No. You're right.

438
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:09,760
The microphone<b>might be rejecting you.</b>

439
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,240
You might get electrocuted.

440
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:13,740
(Dr. Co is being strict<b>while Nucksal is teasing him.)</b>

441
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:15,010
I have to be careful.

442
00:39:15,010 --> 00:39:16,010
(He believes in what they said.)

443
00:39:16,670 --> 00:39:18,130
He's the type who needs<b>lots of attention.</b>

444
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:19,840
He's starting to get on my nerves.

445
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:20,840
(Dr. Co is being strict<b>while Nucksal is teasing him again.)</b>

446
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:25,950
(She starts over<b>and begins recording again.)</b>

447
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:28,510
(He looks serious.)

448
00:39:28,990 --> 00:39:31,010
(They are no longer smiling<b>and looks stiff.)</b>

449
00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:34,050
Her voice is too shaky. Was it okay?<b>Let's listen to it again.</b>

450
00:39:34,050 --> 00:39:35,760
- Let's do it a few more times.<b>- Okay.</b>

451
00:39:36,930 --> 00:39:40,130
(Ji Hyo has to repeat her part<b>over and over again.)</b>

452
00:39:40,450 --> 00:39:43,360
- Everything is good, Ji Hyo.<b>- Do I just do as I'm doing now?</b>

453
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:45,170
Your voice is shaky<b>because you're nervous.</b>

454
00:39:45,170 --> 00:39:46,570
Do you want to sit down?

455
00:39:46,570 --> 00:39:47,570
- People also record while sitting.<b>- No. It's better for me...</b>

456
00:39:47,570 --> 00:39:48,610
to do it while standing.

457
00:39:48,610 --> 00:39:49,900
- Okay. If that's the case...<b>- I'll give it a shot.</b>

458
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:51,240
- Just take your time.<b>- Okay.</b>

459
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:52,300
You're doing fine.

460
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:55,010
Don't worry, Ji Hyo. Just relax.

461
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,510
We have a lot of time.

462

00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:30,530
(17 days before the fan meeting.)

475
00:43:30,530 --> 00:43:32,300
So, today...

476
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:35,220
is the day we will be<b>recording our song.</b>

477
00:43:35,570 --> 00:43:36,630
Goodness.

478
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:38,260
We meet again.

479
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:40,030
Everything is good.

480
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:42,630
But the lyrics... How do I say this?

481
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:45,280
(What's wrong with the lyrics?)

482
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:49,470
I am disappointed<b>as I couldn't join you...</b>

483
00:43:49,470 --> 00:43:51,150
during the lyrics-writing session.

484
00:43:51,150 --> 00:43:52,740
I had another shooting on that day.

485
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:54,680
You could've chosen<b>a different day but both of you...</b>

486
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:56,510
(You could've chosen another day<b>to write the lyrics.)</b>

487
00:43:56,510 --> 00:43:58,820
I gave it a thought<b>on why you decided...</b>

488
00:43:58,820 --> 00:44:00,360
to do it on that day.

489
00:44:00,490 --> 00:44:03,360
I think SORAN and Jeon So Min...

490
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:06,630
are planning to use me<b>as your puppet.</b>

491
00:44:06,630 --> 00:44:10,430
(He thinks they only want him<b>as their puppet.)</b>

492
00:44:11,030 --> 00:44:13,840
I think you just want me<b>to join you on stage.</b>

493
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:15,170
- Not at all.<b>- That's what crossed my mind.</b>

494
00:44:15,170 --> 00:44:16,300
- That's not true.<b>- It isn't?</b>

495
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:17,300
- We didn't plan that to happen.<b>- Not at all.</b>

496
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:21,200
So, I came up with a team name<b>that's perfect for this situation.</b>

497
00:44:21,510 --> 00:44:23,510
It's "Jeon SORAN and Yoo Jae Suk".

498
00:44:23,510 --> 00:44:25,340
(Jeon SORAN and Yoo Jae Suk)

499
00:44:25,340 --> 00:44:27,420
Don't say that, Jae Suk.

500
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:28,840
Jeon SORAN.

00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:30,010
(Jeon So Min and SORAN<b>featuring Yoo Jae Suk.)</b>

502
00:44:30,010 --> 00:44:31,380
In my opinion,

503
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:33,260
the five of you...

504
00:44:33,260 --> 00:44:35,650
will be working together<b>as a band soon.</b>

505
00:44:35,990 --> 00:44:38,450
- You love that, don't you, So Min?<b>- I love it.</b>

506
00:44:38,450 --> 00:44:40,150
(I'd love that.)

507
00:44:40,150 --> 00:44:43,090
(That's how they decided on<b>"Jeon SORAN and Yoo Jae Suk".)</b>

508
00:44:43,090 --> 00:44:45,860
I'll tell you the reason<b>I am scared of the lyrics.</b>

509
00:44:45,860 --> 00:44:47,090
- You know the reason, don't you?<b>- What is it?</b>

510
00:44:47,090 --> 00:44:49,800
Her past love story<b>which she told me about...</b>

511
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:50,930
is described in the lyrics.

512
00:44:50,930 --> 00:44:55,380
(The lyrics are about<b>So Min's love story.)</b>

513
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:58,110
I mean...

514
00:44:58,380 --> 00:45:00,880
I am not merely enjoying the song.

515
00:45:01,220 --> 00:45:02,820
But it feels like I am relaying<b>a message to someone...</b>

516
00:45:02,820 --> 00:45:04,490
on So Min's behalf.

517
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:07,880
(That is what the lyrics are about.)

518
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:09,720
I understand what you're saying,

519
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:11,180
but if you put that aside...

520
00:45:11,450 --> 00:45:13,360
and just read the lyrics,

521
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:14,860
you'll see that So Min is a genius.

522
00:45:14,860 --> 00:45:16,670
People around me are hyped up<b>about it.</b>

523
00:45:16,670 --> 00:45:19,470
I understand that<b>and share the same thoughts...</b>

524
00:45:19,470 --> 00:45:20,900
about the lyrics in general.

525
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:23,860
But must we include,<b>"Do you want to kiss me"?</b>

526
00:45:23,860 --> 00:45:25,780
(It's overly explicit.)

527
00:45:25,780 --> 00:45:29,700
I want this song<b>to be played in all stores...</b>

528
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:32,650
and make sure that he has no choice<b>but to confess to me.</b>

529
00:45:32,650 --> 00:45:36,320
(She wants the song to become a hit,<b>and he has to confess to her.)</b>

530
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:39,490
(You have our support, So Min.)

531
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:42,050
(Her parents are shocked again.)

532
00:45:42,050 --> 00:45:44,150
(So Min wrote,<b>"Do you want to kiss me"?)</b>

533
00:45:44,380 --> 00:45:45,720
(Their daughter's love life is<b>bolder than they thought.)</b>

534
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:47,490
- He'll be so bothered by this.<b>- So Min.</b>

535
00:45:47,490 --> 00:45:48,930
He'll be so bothered by this...

536
00:45:49,090 --> 00:45:52,200
- and has no choice but to confess.<b>- "You can just speak up."</b>

537
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:53,700
- That's right.<b>- "Or you can just..."</b>

538
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:55,930
What do you think of the lyrics?

539
00:45:55,930 --> 00:45:58,280
The lyrics are not fictional...

540
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:00,470
and are full of sincerity.<b>So, I like it a lot.</b>

541
00:46:00,470 --> 00:46:02,380
- You like it, don't you?<b>- But...</b>

542
00:46:02,380 --> 00:46:04,780
imagine that you are the man...

543
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:06,820
whom she is talking about<b>in this song.</b>

544
00:46:06,820 --> 00:46:09,010
I will feel very uncomfortable.

545
00:46:09,010 --> 00:46:11,920
(I will feel very uncomfortable.)

546
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:13,220
(Her direct lyrics<b>will make him feel uncomfortable.)</b>

547
00:46:13,220 --> 00:46:17,090
Right? Yes!<b>That's what I'm talking about.</b>

548
00:46:18,050 --> 00:46:20,200
- So Min.<b>- Yes.</b>

549
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:22,530
- Let's begin recording our song.<b>- Okay.</b>

550
00:46:23,090 --> 00:46:25,030
- You can do this, Jae Suk.<b>- You can do this.</b>

551
00:46:25,030 --> 00:46:27,300
- He's a good singer.<b>- No, I'm not.</b>

552
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:29,970
- I'll try my best. Okay.<b>- Let's begin.</b>

553
00:46:30,970 --> 00:46:33,740
(After their guest artist's<b>energetic recording...)</b>

554
00:46:33,740 --> 00:46:35,650
(Before this song ends)

555
00:46:37,010 --> 00:46:38,950
Give it a shot.

556
00:46:38,950 --> 00:46:41,070
(She's too emotional.)

557
00:46:42,150 --> 00:46:45,880
(The lyrics are about<b>So Min's true love story.)</b>

558
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:49,990
(Jeon SORAN and Yoo Jae Suk's<b>"Confess Already".)</b>

559
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:51,650
Race starts.

560
00:46:51,650 --> 00:46:53,220
(The performance<b>will be revealed right now.)</b>

561
00:46:54,550 --> 00:46:57,530
("Confess Already"<b>by Jeon SORAN and Yoo Jae Suk)</b>

562
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:16,090
All right!

563
00:48:21,380 --> 00:48:22,450
Make some noise!

564
00:48:30,050 --> 00:48:31,220
All right!

565
00:49:10,670 --> 00:49:12,530
(Yoo Jae Suk)

566
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:40,550
Make some noise!

567
00:50:02,510 --> 00:50:04,220
Let's go!

568
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:06,380
Come on!

569
00:50:33,550 --> 00:50:35,010
All right!

570
00:50:36,150 --> 00:50:37,820
Jump!

571
00:50:39,950 --> 00:50:42,320
- Scream!<b>- Jump!</b>

572
00:51:08,590 --> 00:51:10,050
Thank you.

573
00:51:10,050 --> 00:51:11,420
Yoo Jae Suk!

574
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:14,360
(Yoo Jae Suk)

575
00:51:14,490 --> 00:51:18,430
The last collaboration<b>performance awaits you.</b>

576
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:19,820
(Team Gummy, the best singing team)

577
00:51:19,820 --> 00:51:22,090
The member that stands out<b>in this team is Haha.</b>

578
00:51:22,090 --> 00:51:25,260
- Of course.<b>- He's with two talented singers.</b>

579
00:51:25,530 --> 00:51:28,260
(Ant is between talented singers,<b>Gummy and Mosquito)</b>

580
00:51:28,260 --> 00:51:31,170
I don't know how it will turn out.

581
00:51:31,170 --> 00:51:33,340
Let's meet the next group.

582
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:35,900
This was Jeon SORAN and Yoo Jae Suk.<b>Thank you!</b>

583
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:37,340
- Thank you!<b>- Thank you!</b>

584
00:51:37,340 --> 00:51:38,380
(This was Jeon SORAN<b>and Yoo Jae Suk.)</b>

585
00:51:38,380 --> 00:51:41,780
(Jeon SORAN<b>and Yoo Jae Suk are the best!)</b>

586
00:51:42,820 --> 00:51:44,490
(Gummy)

587
00:51:44,490 --> 00:51:45,950
(Kim Jong Kook)

588
00:51:46,260 --> 00:51:47,610
(Haha)

589
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:51,780
(F-Killer, Running Man<b>9th Anniversary Project)</b>

590
00:51:52,990 --> 00:51:55,200
- Okay.<b>- Why are you clapping?</b>

591
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:56,670
(Everyone gives a standing ovation.)

592
00:51:56,670 --> 00:51:58,220
Why?

593
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:01,130
- Gosh, I feel pressured.<b>- We got her.</b>

594
00:52:01,130 --> 00:52:04,240
- Great, we have high hopes.<b>- I feel very pressured.</b>

595
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:06,030
There's no way that<b>you won't be amazing.</b>

596
00:52:06,030 --> 00:52:08,030
- Jong Kook.<b>- You know what I mean?</b>

597
00:52:08,650 --> 00:52:10,780
(She sounds amazing<b>even as she warms up.)</b>

598
00:52:10,780 --> 00:52:11,950
(She's ready.)

599
00:52:11,950 --> 00:52:13,420
Okay, thank you.

600
00:52:13,420 --> 00:52:16,450
All right, shall we practice?

601
00:52:16,450 --> 00:52:17,490
Okay.

602
00:52:17,490 --> 00:52:22,130
(It's the only collaboration team<b>that sings ballad songs.)</b>

603
00:52:22,220 --> 00:52:26,550
(She becomes a professional when<b>she enters the recording studio.)</b>

604
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:34,470
(I remember your sparkling eyes)

605
00:52:34,470 --> 00:52:35,700
I'll do it again.

606
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:37,760
(She's Gummy indeed.)

607
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:39,800
That's good, that's good.

608
00:52:40,430 --> 00:52:45,280
You can sing with strength,<b>"I listen to your voice."</b>

609
00:52:45,340 --> 00:52:47,950
But it's better that you sing<b>the later part with emotions.</b>

610
00:52:47,950 --> 00:52:50,180
It'll be great if you sing<b>the first part powerfully.</b>

611
00:52:50,180 --> 00:52:52,360
I also prefer that you sing<b>the first part powerfully.</b>

612
00:52:52,550 --> 00:52:53,680
Hold on!

613
00:52:53,990 --> 00:52:55,760
(He intercepts.)

614
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:57,530
(Hold on.)

615
00:52:57,530 --> 00:52:59,760
- When you sing, "sparkling",<b>- Be quiet.</b>

616
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:02,090
sing "sparkling" twice, understand?

617
00:53:02,090 --> 00:53:04,200
(He adds an extra word.)

618
00:53:04,990 --> 00:53:07,630
Try singing, "I remember your<b>sparkling, sparkling eyes."</b>

619
00:53:07,930 --> 00:53:10,670
I remember<b>I got it. I'll do it again.</b>

620
00:53:10,670 --> 00:53:13,570
I remember<b>Can you sing it like this?</b>

621
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:17,650
It's less boring.<b>I remember</b>

622
00:53:17,650 --> 00:53:20,320
I remember<b>Like this?</b>

623
00:53:20,380 --> 00:53:22,320
I'll do this at every phrase.

624
00:53:22,610 --> 00:53:24,320
Let's end it.

625
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:25,780
(He has nothing to say<b>as Gummy accepts everything.)</b>

626
00:53:25,780 --> 00:53:28,360
Let's end it because I feel so bad.

627
00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:29,950
I ruined the atmosphere.

628
00:53:29,950 --> 00:53:33,400
Your sparkling, sparkling eyes

629
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:36,990
(She does what she's told.)

630
00:53:36,990 --> 00:53:40,260
(I remember)

631
00:53:42,070 --> 00:53:45,930
Can we record it like this once?

632
00:53:45,930 --> 00:53:47,400
I'll keep it to myself.

633
00:53:47,740 --> 00:53:49,340
- Really?<b>- Yes.</b>

634
00:53:49,340 --> 00:53:51,010
- I'm being serious.<b>- Okay.</b>

635
00:53:51,010 --> 00:53:52,280
(Friendly Gummy agrees again.)

636
00:54:01,510 --> 00:54:04,860
(Your sparkling, sparkling eyes)

637
00:54:05,450 --> 00:54:08,990
(She's very serious.)

638
00:54:09,170 --> 00:54:12,070
(I remember)

639
00:54:13,990 --> 00:54:16,800
(Wow, Gummy did it for me!)

640
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:19,930
What do you think, Producer Haha?

641
00:54:19,930 --> 00:54:21,340
Okay, that was good.

642
00:54:21,340 --> 00:54:23,010
Let's listen to it and move on.

643
00:54:23,010 --> 00:54:24,340
(We hope that<b>it cured his broken heart.)</b>

644
00:54:25,570 --> 00:54:27,970
(Next is Haha's turn.)

645
00:54:27,970 --> 00:54:30,090
(He's quite serious.)

646
00:54:34,610 --> 00:54:38,490
(He gets emotional<b>and calmly sings phrase by phrase.)</b>

647
00:54:39,530 --> 00:54:42,530
(He's singing well.)

648
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:45,760
- Haha, you sound great.<b>- Okay.</b>

649
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:48,630
I'm sorry, but we have<b>a specific team name.</b>

650
00:54:48,630 --> 00:54:50,740
- Yes?<b>- We have to call him Mr. Blowfly.</b>

651
00:54:51,630 --> 00:54:53,300
(I see.)

652
00:54:53,300 --> 00:54:55,510
- Excuse me, Mr. Blowfly.<b>- Yes?</b>

653
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:58,880
(Excuse me, Mr. Blowfly?)

654
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:00,880
- That's right.<b>- Is the person...</b>

655
00:55:01,220 --> 00:55:02,680
who spoke Mr. Mosquito?

656
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:06,380
Yes.<b>Listen to your voice</b>

657
00:55:06,380 --> 00:55:08,010
When you say "voice"...

658
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:10,760
- Could you sing that part again?<b>- Voice</b>

659
00:55:10,990 --> 00:55:13,130
Voice, voice

660
00:55:13,130 --> 00:55:14,450
Do it like this.

661
00:55:14,450 --> 00:55:17,990
Your teeth on top should<b>touch the lower lip. "Voice".</b>

662
00:55:17,990 --> 00:55:20,130
- Voice<b>- I listen to your voice</b>

663
00:55:20,130 --> 00:55:21,530
- You got it.<b>- Okay.</b>

664
00:55:21,530 --> 00:55:22,530
Okay.

665
00:55:22,530 --> 00:55:24,700
(After practicing,)

666
00:55:24,700 --> 00:55:25,970
(he pronounces<b>the letter V correctly.)</b>

667
00:55:25,970 --> 00:55:27,240
That's good.

668
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:31,150
(That's right. He's doing well.)

669
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:33,450
He pronounced "voice".

670
00:55:34,970 --> 00:55:38,380
(Fan Killer number 1,<b>Mr. Mosquito also records.)</b>

671
00:55:38,380 --> 00:55:40,780
- That's amazing.<b>- That lump...</b>

672
00:55:41,260 --> 00:55:43,530
(On the day of the rehearsal)

673
00:55:43,530 --> 00:55:45,130
Don't be discouraged.

674
00:55:45,130 --> 00:55:46,450
You can do it!

675
00:55:46,450 --> 00:55:48,030
Sing well.

676
00:55:48,030 --> 00:55:50,090
Mosquito, Gummy, and Ant, let's go!

677
00:55:50,090 --> 00:55:51,320
(It's a team of insects.)

678
00:55:52,170 --> 00:55:53,990
- Am I an ant?<b>- You're an ant.</b>

679
00:55:53,990 --> 00:55:55,510
Let's start.

680
00:55:55,510 --> 00:55:57,240
Don't be discouraged, Haha.

681
00:55:58,110 --> 00:56:00,880
- You can do it!<b>- Don't beat Jong Kook or Gummy.</b>

682
00:56:01,610 --> 00:56:04,950
(With other members' cheering,<b>they start their rehearsal.)</b>

683
00:56:05,950 --> 00:56:10,650
(After Jong Kook's<b>mellow singing part,)</b>

684
00:56:10,650 --> 00:56:13,590
(it's Gummy's turn.)

685
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:16,930
(Someone in the corner takes<b>our attention away.)</b>

686
00:56:16,930 --> 00:56:19,200
(In the end, he makes a gesture.)

687
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:20,990
(He destroys the emotion.)

688
00:56:22,570 --> 00:56:24,490
(Laughing)

689
00:56:24,700 --> 00:56:26,670
(What is he doing?)

690
00:56:28,090 --> 00:56:31,670
(He's expressing with his body,<b>"I am also here.")</b>

691
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:34,800
(He definitely has a presence.)

692
00:56:35,510 --> 00:56:38,150
(It's a performance of<b>2 ballad singers and 1 dancer.)</b>

693
00:56:38,150 --> 00:56:40,550
- Good job!<b>- Great!</b>

694
00:56:41,340 --> 00:56:43,610
(Haha doesn't have to be<b>discouraged.)</b>

695
00:56:43,610 --> 00:56:45,380
Mosquito, Gummy, and Ant are great.

696
00:56:45,380 --> 00:56:46,780
We're with you.

697
00:56:46,780 --> 00:56:50,650
(Haha sings a ballad<b>for the first time.)</b>

698
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:53,200
(It's a collaboration performance<b>with Jong Kook and Gummy.)</b>

699
00:56:57,400 --> 00:57:01,900
("Raise Your Voice" by F-Killer)

700
01:00:24,760 --> 01:00:25,780
(Running Man)

701
01:00:25,780 --> 01:00:29,900
(Group Dance Project)

702
01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:32,070
Okay, shall we do it?

703
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:33,880
It's a big single file.

704
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:36,550
Haha is in the front.

705
01:00:36,550 --> 01:00:40,280
Se Chan will come out to the left.

706
01:00:40,280 --> 01:00:42,220
- This way?<b>- In front of his chest,</b>

707
01:00:42,220 --> 01:00:44,590
do this movement.

708
01:00:44,590 --> 01:00:48,090
1, 2, stop, stop, stop, stop. Okay.

709
01:00:48,820 --> 01:00:50,530
- Raise it higher.<b>- Higher?</b>

710
01:00:50,530 --> 01:00:52,470
- It's about this high.<b>- Higher? Okay.</b>

711
01:00:52,670 --> 01:00:54,340
One and okay.

712
01:00:55,130 --> 01:00:56,430
(Jong Kook bursts out laughing.)

713
01:00:56,430 --> 01:00:58,530
- That was excellent.<b>- We'll start.</b>

714
01:00:58,530 --> 01:01:01,400
Shouldn't we only show the arms?

715
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:02,740
We can't show our heads.

716
01:01:02,740 --> 01:01:04,970
Shouldn't we only show the arms?<b>We can't show our heads.</b>

717
01:01:07,610 --> 01:01:09,340
- We keep making eye contact.<b>- Ma'am.</b>

718
01:01:09,340 --> 01:01:11,110
We shouldn't show our head.

719
01:01:11,110 --> 01:01:12,380
He's tall for nothing.

720
01:01:12,380 --> 01:01:14,260
It seemed odd.

721
01:01:14,380 --> 01:01:17,880
It looks like Kwang Soo's head<b>with legs like a centipede.</b>

722
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:21,860
It looks like Kwang Soo's head<b>with legs like a centipede.</b>

723
01:01:22,860 --> 01:01:24,430
- That's true.<b>- Right?</b>

724
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:26,930
- You're right.<b>- We're an insect.</b>

725
01:01:27,260 --> 01:01:30,200
Kwang Soo, bend your knees.

726
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:33,570
Okay, 5, 6, 7, 8.

727
01:01:34,380 --> 01:01:35,800
(They continue their practice.)

728
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:39,010
1 and 2 and 3 and 4 and...

729
01:01:39,010 --> 01:01:42,320
5 and 6 and 7.

730
01:01:42,590 --> 01:01:43,590
(She's observant.)

731
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:46,280
- Suk Jin.<b>- Wake up, Suk Jin!</b>

732
01:01:46,280 --> 01:01:48,760
- Please!<b>- Act your age!</b>

733
01:01:50,260 --> 01:01:52,820
I was wrong only once so far.

734
01:01:52,900 --> 01:01:54,900
- Act your age.<b>- Let's act our age.</b>

735
01:01:55,260 --> 01:01:57,320
Let's go, we can do it.<b>We aren't fools.</b>

736
01:01:57,320 --> 01:01:58,990
Shut your mouth<b>when we're practicing!</b>

737
01:02:00,760 --> 01:02:01,760
(They're strict with Suk Jin.)

738
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:03,840
- Shut it and concentrate!<b>- That's right.</b>

739
01:02:04,740 --> 01:02:06,740
- I'm a huge fan.<b>- Me too.</b>

740
01:02:06,970 --> 01:02:10,700
As you move the left foot,<b>pull on the right and left.</b>

741
01:02:10,700 --> 01:02:12,820
Then do this twice.

742
01:02:12,820 --> 01:02:13,840
(It's important to bounce<b>the pelvis powerfully.)</b>

743
01:02:13,840 --> 01:02:15,740
This is Jang Do Yeon's dance.

744
01:02:15,950 --> 01:02:18,220
If you bend your knees<b>and move only the pelvis,</b>

745
01:02:18,220 --> 01:02:20,110
it's similar to a movement<b>in hip hop.</b>

746
01:02:20,550 --> 01:02:22,090
Yes, It's hip hop.

747
01:02:22,090 --> 01:02:23,930
Is that hip hop?

748
01:02:25,220 --> 01:02:28,090
(This is hip hop!)

749
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:30,320
- Right.<b>- Is that hip hop?</b>

750
01:02:30,320 --> 01:02:33,090
- What?<b>- Look, don't do that.</b>

751
01:02:33,470 --> 01:02:35,590
You don't twist the knees.

752
01:02:35,590 --> 01:02:37,400
Do it like this.

753
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:40,930
(He doesn't understand.)

754
01:02:41,340 --> 01:02:43,070
Hey, please.

755
01:02:43,800 --> 01:02:45,840
Kwang Soo, remember to smile.

756
01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:47,720
(He realizes that he has to smile.)

757
01:02:48,970 --> 01:02:50,220
Smile.

758
01:02:50,220 --> 01:02:51,920
(Peaceful)

759
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:56,530
(His smile spreads happiness<b>to everyone.)</b>

760
01:02:57,220 --> 01:02:59,630
(Is it okay<b>since everyone is laughing?)</b>

761
01:02:59,650 --> 01:03:01,930
He's driving me crazy.

762
01:03:02,720 --> 01:03:04,760
It's terrible.

763
01:03:04,760 --> 01:03:06,470
What? I'm not a fool.

764
01:03:06,840 --> 01:03:08,200
- Okay.<b>- It's the individual dance.</b>

765
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:11,300
You'll start. My group did a wave,

766
01:03:11,300 --> 01:03:15,200
but people hope to see<b>your individual dance.</b>

767
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:18,450
- Each person does a freestyle?<b>- Dance as you'd like.</b>

768
01:03:18,450 --> 01:03:21,740
However, you have to keep it<b>connected.</b>

769
01:03:21,740 --> 01:03:23,990
If I send it with my chin...

770
01:03:23,990 --> 01:03:25,150
(It's important to connect<b>the dance between individuals.)</b>

771
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:27,110
(If sent by the chin,<b>receive with the chin.)</b>

772
01:03:27,110 --> 01:03:29,090
The next person receives<b>with the chin.</b>

773
01:03:29,720 --> 01:03:32,180
- Goodness.<b>- That's correct.</b>

774
01:03:32,180 --> 01:03:34,860
(They suddenly receive<b>with their chin.)</b>

775
01:03:36,490 --> 01:03:39,490
(They work well as a team<b>for things like this.)</b>

776
01:03:39,630 --> 01:03:40,800
This is fun.

777
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:44,240
(They toss it to Lia.)

778
01:03:44,740 --> 01:03:46,930
Lia received it.

779
01:03:47,130 --> 01:03:49,550
(She receives it.)

780
01:03:50,050 --> 01:03:51,700
Lia received it.

781
01:03:51,700 --> 01:03:52,720
(Lia is the best.)

782
01:03:53,050 --> 01:03:55,320
This is what we do.<b>If I throw it with my shoulder,</b>

783
01:03:55,880 --> 01:03:57,450
someone receives it<b>with their shoulder.</b>

784
01:03:58,740 --> 01:04:00,110
With which part are you throwing it?

785
01:04:00,680 --> 01:04:01,950
I'll dance for a long time.

786
01:04:02,320 --> 01:04:04,130
Try and throw it.

787
01:04:04,680 --> 01:04:06,490
I'll dance for around a minute.

788
01:04:06,650 --> 01:04:07,860
- That sounds good.<b>- For one minute.</b>

789
01:04:07,860 --> 01:04:10,490
- With which part will you give?<b>- When will you give?</b>

790
01:04:10,490 --> 01:04:13,470
With which part will he give?<b>He took it back.</b>

791
01:04:13,990 --> 01:04:15,240
- Will you give?<b>- Will you give?</b>

792
01:04:15,240 --> 01:04:16,260
Are you going up?

793
01:04:16,860 --> 01:04:18,530
He spat it out.

794
01:04:18,740 --> 01:04:20,530
(Haha receives it with his mouth<b>and sends it with his bottom.)</b>

795
01:04:20,630 --> 01:04:21,800
(Se Chan receives it<b>with his bottom.)</b>

796
01:04:23,840 --> 01:04:26,920
(What is he doing?)

797
01:04:26,920 --> 01:04:28,420
- Hey!<b>- Hey!</b>

798
01:04:29,110 --> 01:04:31,650
(Everyone raises their voice<b>as he uses his pelvis.)</b>

799
01:04:31,650 --> 01:04:33,360
This is hip hop.

800
01:04:33,510 --> 01:04:35,150
Isn't it hip hop?

801
01:04:35,150 --> 01:04:38,780
You said that it's hip hop.

802
01:04:38,780 --> 01:04:41,720
I'm sorry. I apologize.

803
01:04:41,720 --> 01:04:42,820
I'm sorry.

804
01:04:42,820 --> 01:04:46,430
Decide with which part<b>you'll toss it.</b>

805
01:04:46,430 --> 01:04:48,400
You decide for yourself.

806
01:04:48,590 --> 01:04:52,030
- I received it.<b>- Go down and up again.</b>

807
01:04:52,240 --> 01:04:53,880
- Toss.<b>- Se Chan.</b>

808
01:04:53,880 --> 01:04:55,430
- Toss.<b>- His face. That's right.</b>

809
01:04:55,430 --> 01:04:56,900
Receive it with your face.

810
01:04:56,900 --> 01:04:59,740
- He tossed it with his face.<b>- It goes through the shoulder.</b>

811
01:04:59,740 --> 01:05:01,070
Then I toss it.

812
01:05:01,070 --> 01:05:04,490
- It's the shoulder.<b>- I receive it and it goes up.</b>

813
01:05:04,490 --> 01:05:05,780
What's wrong with you?

814
01:05:07,220 --> 01:05:08,990
(Spitting)

815
01:05:10,380 --> 01:05:13,150
(Are you spitting at me now?)

816
01:05:13,150 --> 01:05:16,700
- It's what I wanted to do.<b>- That's the end.</b>

817
01:05:16,700 --> 01:05:19,030
- Do it.<b>- Receive it like this.</b>

818
01:05:19,030 --> 01:05:21,670
Receive it<b>and toss it with the pelvis.</b>

819
01:05:23,010 --> 01:05:25,130
1, 2, 3, 4.

820
01:05:25,130 --> 01:05:27,510
- Will you kick?<b>- Move like you got kicked.</b>

821
01:05:27,510 --> 01:05:29,800
Do it like you're collapsing.

822
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:31,570
- That's basic.<b>- That's right.</b>

823
01:05:33,970 --> 01:05:36,050
(I know how to dance.)

824
01:05:36,510 --> 01:05:37,950
- You're doing well.<b>- You're doing well.</b>

825
01:05:37,950 --> 01:05:38,950
(He receives with his legs...)

826
01:05:38,950 --> 01:05:40,490
(and tosses with his chest.)

827
01:05:41,050 --> 01:05:43,630
(He receives with his chest.)

828
01:05:43,630 --> 01:05:46,950
- What's next? Turn.<b>- I receive it.</b>

829
01:05:46,950 --> 01:05:48,130
That's good.

830
01:05:48,630 --> 01:05:51,930
- Yes, do it like that.<b>- It looks like a driving dance.</b>

831
01:05:51,930 --> 01:05:53,590
(They finish practicing<b>their individual dance.)</b>

832
01:05:57,860 --> 01:05:59,200
Let's go!

833
01:06:01,380 --> 01:06:04,200
Boom, boom. Come up and boom, boom.

834
01:06:04,200 --> 01:06:06,180
5, 6, 7, 8.

835
01:06:06,180 --> 01:06:08,010
1, 2, 3, 4.

836
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:28,070
Put your hands together.

837
01:06:28,170 --> 01:06:30,510
You worked very hard until now.

838
01:06:30,510 --> 01:06:33,630
Make today's last performance<b>amazing.</b>

839
01:06:34,200 --> 01:06:36,300
(We hope that they perform<b>without mistakes.)</b>

840
01:06:36,300 --> 01:06:38,550
1, 2, 3.

841
01:06:38,550 --> 01:06:40,570
- Let's go!<b>- Let's go!</b>

842
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:45,150
(How will their group dance turn out<b>after 3 months of practice?)</b>

843
01:06:47,010 --> 01:06:50,820
("Boom and Just Blow"<b>by all Running Man members)</b>

844
01:07:06,970 --> 01:07:08,570
(The start is strong.)

845
01:07:08,570 --> 01:07:10,010
(Everyone gapes.)

846
01:07:20,650 --> 01:07:23,360
(Without bumping into Kwang Soo,<b>he moves successfully.)</b>

847
01:07:32,570 --> 01:07:34,530
(They move in sync.)

848
01:07:44,110 --> 01:07:45,900
(It's Suk Jin's turn this time.)

849
01:07:46,420 --> 01:07:48,420
(People watch Suk Jin in a daze.)

850
01:07:49,340 --> 01:07:50,950
(This is really amazing.)

851
01:07:50,950 --> 01:07:52,050
They're in sync.

852
01:08:09,030 --> 01:08:11,360
(The change in the song makes<b>the atmosphere cheerful.)</b>

853
01:08:12,340 --> 01:08:15,380
(It's Jong Kook's lifting of So Min<b>that they were worried about.)</b>

854
01:08:23,240 --> 01:08:24,740
(They do it without mistakes.)

855
01:08:26,980 --> 01:08:28,260
That was great.

856
01:08:34,060 --> 01:08:36,930
(They've been working together<b>for 9 years.)</b>

857
01:08:36,930 --> 01:08:39,430
(They show it off on stage.)

858
01:08:47,100 --> 01:08:48,810
(It's time for Ji Hyo and So Min.)

859
01:08:49,310 --> 01:08:51,310
(The audience shouts.)

860
01:09:00,020 --> 01:09:01,020
(Never seen before on Running Man)

861
01:09:01,020 --> 01:09:04,150
(It's a captivating scene<b>of the two.)</b>

862
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:19,200
(They move quickly<b>to a single file.)</b>

863
01:09:50,230 --> 01:09:52,600
(They start<b>the individual dance part.)</b>

864
01:10:05,810 --> 01:10:07,390
(She finishes with<b>the steering wheel dance.)</b>

865
01:10:08,350 --> 01:10:10,950
(Everyone gets excited.)

866
01:10:25,470 --> 01:10:30,050
(It's an amazing finish<b>that matches the fan-meet.)</b>

867
01:10:34,110 --> 01:10:39,050
(The members stay in their position<b>after their group dance.)</b>

868
01:10:41,150 --> 01:10:46,150
(The audience shouts endlessly<b>for the amazing performance.)</b>

869
01:10:48,450 --> 01:10:50,820
(It was really amazing!)

870
01:10:50,820 --> 01:10:51,820
Bravo.

871
01:10:53,100 --> 01:10:54,640
Ji Hyo is a good dancer.

872
01:10:54,640 --> 01:10:56,940
Ji Hyo's facial expression was<b>professional.</b>

873
01:10:57,310 --> 01:10:59,670
I bet they'll get teary<b>after such a performance.</b>

874
01:10:59,670 --> 01:11:01,380
Isn't it moving?

875
01:11:01,640 --> 01:11:03,900
Right? Isn't it touching?

876
01:11:08,180 --> 01:11:16,220
(The members on stage smile<b>after a long time.)</b>

877
01:11:17,690 --> 01:11:20,760
(Everyone doubted that<b>they could do it.)</b>

878
01:11:20,760 --> 01:11:25,190
(The 8 Running Man members performed<b>beyond expectations.)</b>

879
01:11:25,470 --> 01:11:29,670
(They encourage and cheer<b>one another.)</b>

880
01:11:30,200 --> 01:11:32,010
Thank you so much.

881
01:11:32,010 --> 01:11:34,030
- Thank you.<b>- As always,</b>

882
01:11:34,030 --> 01:11:35,600
we thank you,<b>and we won't forget it.</b>

883
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:39,480
As I said before, we hope that<b>you'll be healthy and happy.</b>

884
01:11:39,480 --> 01:11:40,770
This is our last song.

885
01:11:40,920 --> 01:11:43,440
It's Running Man's theme song<b>that we made after nine years.</b>

886
01:11:43,740 --> 01:11:46,310
The song was written by<b>Jung Joon Il.</b>

887
01:11:46,310 --> 01:11:47,810
It's a great song.

888
01:11:47,810 --> 01:11:49,350
- That's right.<b>- It's quite good.</b>

889
01:11:49,350 --> 01:11:50,480
You're right.

890
01:11:51,930 --> 01:11:54,950
(Running Man's theme song<b>for the fan-meet)</b>

891
01:11:56,490 --> 01:11:59,300
(Experienced singer-songwriter<b>to write this special theme song)</b>

892
01:11:59,860 --> 01:12:02,360
(Composer Jung Joon Il)

893
01:12:03,060 --> 01:12:07,600
(Members write the lyrics<b>to the theme song.)</b>

894
01:12:08,070 --> 01:12:12,550
(Despite the lack of singing skills,<b>they try their best and record.)</b>

895
01:12:14,110 --> 01:12:17,920
(Their first theme song<b>with 9 years of emotions)</b>

896
01:12:20,610 --> 01:12:24,230
(How did it turn out?)

897
01:12:37,140 --> 01:12:40,600
("I Like You" by Running Man)

898
01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:02,800
(Song Van)

899
01:13:37,820 --> 01:13:42,840
(Now I will be on your side)

900
01:13:42,840 --> 01:13:46,140
(I can't understand everything)

901
01:13:46,360 --> 01:13:51,700
(But I will lean closer to you)

902
01:13:52,050 --> 01:13:56,070
(Because I like you)

903
01:13:56,070 --> 01:14:01,980
(A difficult today and tomorrow)

904
01:14:01,980 --> 01:14:04,020
(It's okay, stay strong)

905
01:14:04,020 --> 01:14:08,730
(I will run with you)

906
01:14:37,780 --> 01:14:42,890
(That's how we became one)

907
01:14:46,470 --> 01:14:51,560
(Now I will be on your side)

908
01:14:51,560 --> 01:14:54,700
(I can't understand everything)

909
01:14:55,200 --> 01:15:00,380
(But I will lean closer to you)

910
01:15:00,380 --> 01:15:04,610
(Because I like you)

911
01:15:04,610 --> 01:15:10,280
(A difficult today and tomorrow)

912
01:15:10,560 --> 01:15:12,730
(It's okay, stay strong)

913
01:15:12,730 --> 01:15:17,300
(I will run with you)

914
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:24,400
(Believe me, don't believe me)

915
01:15:24,400 --> 01:15:28,270
(Times when I misunderstood you)

916
01:15:28,510 --> 01:15:33,920
(That's why we shone much brighter)

917
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:37,220
(Remember us)

918
01:15:37,720 --> 01:15:39,610
(I'll give it to you)

919
01:15:39,610 --> 01:15:43,060
(My clumsy heart)

920
01:15:43,060 --> 01:15:46,650
(I love you this much)

921
01:15:46,950 --> 01:15:49,820
(On the day)

922
01:15:49,820 --> 01:15:55,840
(On the day we stop this walk)

923
01:15:55,840 --> 01:15:58,200
(Thank you so much)

924
01:15:58,200 --> 01:16:01,980
(Thank you so much, I was you)

925
01:16:01,980 --> 01:16:06,310
(The day when we cried<b>until our eyes hurt)</b>

926
01:16:06,310 --> 01:16:10,550
(The day we could laugh<b>even though it rained)</b>

927
01:16:11,420 --> 01:16:16,950
(They never expressed their true<b>feelings over the last 9 years.)</b>

928
01:16:19,780 --> 01:16:21,650
(All the days)

929
01:16:21,650 --> 01:16:26,230
(All the days are soft and dry)

930
01:16:26,230 --> 01:16:30,600
(I like you)

931
01:16:31,840 --> 01:16:33,380
(The first song they sing<b>to each other after 9 years)</b>

932
01:16:33,380 --> 01:16:35,440
- We love you!<b>- Thank you!</b>

933
01:16:35,440 --> 01:16:40,350
- Thank you!<b>- Thank you!</b>

934

Thank you!
