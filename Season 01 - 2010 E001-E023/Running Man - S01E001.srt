I -Yes. That's why you would run to the bathroom.

693
00:34:19,130 --> 00:34:20,490
[I can't believe it!]

694
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,700
After you start, we'll go.

695
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,400
Don't breathe in the middle.

696
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:26,400
[Start!]

697
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:31,340
The clue is here... It's coming...

698
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:33,710
It's here! <i>Hello! This is SBS Running Man. Hint. In times of expensive oil prices,
we solve air conditioning/heating problems by 0000. Go to 0000.</i>

699
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:37,130
<i>Hello! This is SBS Running Man. Hint. In times of expensive oil prices,
we solve air conditioning/heating problems by 0000. Go to 0000.</i>

700
00:34:37,170 --> 00:34:39,940
<i>Hello! This is SBS Running Man. Hint. In times of expensive oil prices,
we solve air conditioning/heating problems by 0000. Go to 0000.</i>

701
00:34:39,970 --> 00:34:42,370
[Race Start!]

702
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:44,960
[Difficulty level: 3]
[In times of expensive oil prices, we solve air conditioning/heating problems by 0000. Go to 0000.]

703
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:50,600
[In times of expensive oil prices,
we solve air conditioning/heating problems by 0000. Go to 0000.]

704
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,500
Meanwhile, the Cheap Team is...

705
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:55,490
I hate sucking on this!

706
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:57,660
[??]

707
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:05,000
[Everyone generously
giving theirs to Suk Jin]

708
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:11,800
[You're probably thirsty
from all the running, drink up]

709
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:14,210
What are you guys doing?

710
00:35:14,270 --> 00:35:17,100
Kwang Soo, think of a 4 letter word.

711
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:21,830
Joong Ki! Jung Eum! Jong Kook!
Let's all think of a 4 letter word!

712
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:25,300
[Hybrid?]

713
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:27,300
That's five words.
[That's 4 syllables...]

714
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:33,100
[The hint is air conditioning/heating!]

715
00:35:33,450 --> 00:35:35,390
[Where is the second secret code?]

716
00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:38,780
What is the 4 words? Look up there.

717
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:43,970
[What?]
Hey! Stop it!

718
00:35:44,010 --> 00:35:46,790
OKay. Geez.

719
00:35:46,870 --> 00:35:48,910
[They do anything since no one's around]

720
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:53,800
Let's see. What is there?

721
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:57,590
Jung Eum! Regardless of what it is,
just say something with four words.

722
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,670
This is so tiring...

723
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:03,300
You were so bright and enthusiastic.

724
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:06,230
You had fun.

725
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:08,600
But the question is hard...

726
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:11,600
Let's think while sitting down.

727
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:15,260
It's not like we can figure it out
by walking around.

728
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:19,900
Think of something with four words.

729
00:36:20,490 --> 00:36:22,770
Isn't heating and
cooling powered by electricity?

730
00:36:22,790 --> 00:36:25,220
Oil.

731
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:28,500
Electricity. I -Wind power!

732
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:31,410
No. Does that even make sense?

733
00:36:31,450 --> 00:36:33,870
Why not? This place is so tall.
I -Should I look at the message again?

734
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:36,900
[Ignoring]

735
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:40,000
[Kwang Soo, he tried so hard
to say something]

736
00:36:40,730 --> 00:36:42,120
That doesn't make sense.

737
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:47,100
[Again]
There might be another clue in the message.

738
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:49,600
[Ugh.]

739
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:51,740
Kwang Soo, what did you say?

740
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:55,800
Kwang Soo just tell me.
Jong Kook kept on talking.

741
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:59,080
You guys... So... I'm kind of upset...

742
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:04,800
It's not that we don't want to listen to you.
It's because this side...

743
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,500
Okay, Kwang Soo, tell us.

744
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:09,500
[Out of nowhere]

745
00:37:09,530 --> 00:37:11,930
What? It's okay. Tell us.

746
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:14,930
Can it be related to clothing?

747
00:37:14,970 --> 00:37:17,540
[Hansa Moshi?]

748
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,500
[Oh my God]

749
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:23,700
[Kwang Soo is giving up on his idea...]

750
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:26,390
[The city's air conditioning
was done by clothing?]

751
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:29,100
[Cheap Team is still doing
their punishment]

752
00:37:29,130 --> 00:37:31,340
Gary is the man!

753
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:34,510
Give us the clue please.

754
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:40,400
In times of expensive oil prices,
we solve air conditioning/heating problems by 0000. Go to 0000.

755
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:42,370
Central Heating Room!

756
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,200
Solar energy?

757
00:37:44,210 --> 00:37:47,080
Can solar energy provide cooling?

758
00:37:47,110 --> 00:37:49,630
Do we have to go to the roof?

759
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:53,800
It seems like the roof.
I -Let's talk while we walk.

760
00:37:53,890 --> 00:37:57,780
It's not oil or gas.

761
00:37:58,100 --> 00:37:59,400
Let's just go up.

762
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,700
[Startled!]

763
00:38:01,950 --> 00:38:04,450
[That team doesn't know either!]

764
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:06,260
[Discovered each other!]

765
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:10,100
They saw us.

766
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:11,380
They saw us.

767
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:15,500
Since they're hiding like that, does it mean that
they already know the answer? I -No. They don't know.

768
00:38:15,530 --> 00:38:17,930
They are just trying
to take off your name tag.

769
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:20,210
[Kwang Soo experienced it before]

770
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:23,810
Let's take a took upstairs.

771
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:26,590
[The Expensive Team is on the 4th floor
while the Cheap Team is on the 5th floor]

772
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,000
The roof! The roof!

773
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:34,990
[Cheap Team's opinions
lead them towards the roof]

774
00:38:35,050 --> 00:38:38,960
The roof is right.

775
00:38:38,990 --> 00:38:41,330
[Can the secret code
be located at the rooftop?]

776
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:43,590
It is rooftop!

777
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:46,130
We'll win if we get there first! Hurry!

778
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:52,320
Guys. Be quiet. Try not to make loud steps.

779
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:54,180
Can you lock the door?

780
00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:55,560
You can't?

781
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:05,300
Wait, isn't it the rooftop?

782
00:39:05,310 --> 00:39:07,640
Those guys are running!

783
00:39:07,690 --> 00:39:10,820
Let's go to the roof!

784
00:39:10,850 --> 00:39:12,670
Where? Isn't it there?

785
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:15,070
[This way and that]

786
00:39:15,090 --> 00:39:19,040
Hurry and film us! Film us!

787
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:21,400
Oh my God!

788
00:39:21,830 --> 00:39:23,880
Run! Run! Run!

789
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:28,800
[Cheap Team is already at the rooftop]

790
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,980
[Is the secret code at the rooftop?]

791
00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:37,610
Roof park.

792
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:39,470
There is a sign here.

793
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:47,300
[Sky Park]

794
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:51,600
Guys run! They're coming!

795
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:57,100
Run!

796
00:39:57,140 --> 00:39:59,620
Run!

797
00:40:00,770 --> 00:40:03,130
[The gap in between is getting shorter!]

798
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:10,400
Guys! Catch up with them!

799
00:40:11,490 --> 00:40:13,490
Run faster!

800
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:16,400
[The secret code isn't easily visible]

801
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:20,800
[The person who gets it first
is the keeper]

802
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:25,050
I found it! I found it!

803
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:26,670
Here!

804
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:28,580
[The second secret clue!]

805
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:32,990
[The secret clue is
placed on top of the sculpture!]

806
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,400
Its here!

807
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:44,800
[Get the secret code
that is hanging in the air]

808
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:49,400
Bend down!

809
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:54,100
[Gary gets down after hearing Hyori]

810
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:57,900
[Is the secret code
going to be in Hyori's hands?!]

811
00:40:57,900 --> 00:40:59,300
[No!]

812
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,400
[It's mine!]

813
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,600
[Missed!]

814
00:41:09,610 --> 00:41:10,770
[Hyori was off by a little]

815
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,570
[Hyori was off by a little]

816
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:17,300
[In which hands will
the secret bottle go into...]

817
00:41:19,290 --> 00:41:21,490
[Fighting for the bottle
is these two teams]

818
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:24,480
[Meet up]

819
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:29,400
[Haha takes this as an opportunity]

820
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:34,100
[If only Haha gets it with his hands!]

821
00:41:37,390 --> 00:41:39,420
[But at this time!]

822
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:45,300
[Grab]

823
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:48,840
[Kwang Soo easily gets it and succeeds!]

824
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:53,800
[Second Round, RACE OVER]

825
00:41:54,610 --> 00:41:56,360
[Second Round, the Expensive Team wins!]

826
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:59,390
[We were really
disadvantaged in this game.]

827
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:05,200
[The second secret number = 3
(Number of people)]

828
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:07,330
[Proud]

829
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:11,100
[Three hours of lock-down]

830
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:19,300
Because we need to finish filming before the mall opens,
let's hurry this and make this funny for people.

831
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:22,300
Kwang Soo... are you okay?

832
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:24,600
I'm oka...

833
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:27,110
[Why is the radio suddenly...]

834
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:30,300
Joong Ki... after I do the interview...

835
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:32,110
Tell us, tell us.

836
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:34,500
I'm okay,

837
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,600
[...He is interrupted again...]

838
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,800
Yes.

839
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:47,200
[Rule: You must win the game in order to start the race!]
- Now, the game we will be playing is Chicken Fight.

840
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:51,800
They say that the first team
to go first has more of an advantage.

841
00:42:51,830 --> 00:42:54,510
So let's play a game
to decide who will go first.

842
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:57,550
It will be Lips Rock, Paper, and Scissors.

843
00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:01,700
Rock... Scissors... Paper.

844
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:03,400
Do you understand now?

845
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:05,800
Let's begin with Suk Jin Hyung and I.

846
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:08,500
I look forward to it.

847
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:11,900
Oppa, men can also be cute.

848
00:43:11,930 --> 00:43:13,200
Oppa, take your glasses off!

849
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:15,190
Why?!

850
00:43:15,210 --> 00:43:17,050
[Flustered]
- Why do I have to take my glasses off for this game?

851
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:19,800
Why do I need to take them off
for this game?

852
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:22,030
No, why...?

853
00:43:22,810 --> 00:43:23,900
There's no need.

854
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:25,570
Hey...

855
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:27,100
[Oh my...]

856
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:31,000
I have to take them off?

857
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:35,800
Get close to one another
and open your hearts to each other.

858
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:38,710
[Use this chance to say what has been hidden in your heart.]
- Talk about things you haven't been able to say to each other.

859
00:43:38,730 --> 00:43:40,930
- To be honest, I do have something to say.
- What is it?

860
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:44,490
10 years ago

861
00:43:44,510 --> 00:43:49,720
- You introduced me to my wife, right.
- Of course, I thought that you two would match really well.

862
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:52,300
Why did you do that?!

863
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:55,200
[Haha]

864
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:58,700

00:52:14,420 --> 00:52:16,340
We just have to hold out.

1043
00:52:16,370 --> 00:52:20,390
Everyone! We will now try our hardest,

1044
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:23,540
and play Chicken Fight now.
Please take care of us.

1045

So that we won't get hurt.

1046

Thank you.

1047
00:52:28,100 --> 00:52:29,900
The sound of their applause is...

1048
00:52:30,100 --> 00:52:33,500
Wow this kind of chicken fight...

1049
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
Leave me in the back!

1050
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:39,900
You're our ace.

1051
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:42,920
They're telling Hyo Ri to stand in front!

1052
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:47,200
Even we won't do that.

1053
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:48,360
Ugh, seriously.

1054
00:52:48,370 --> 00:52:49,880

[Flustered]

1057
00:52:58,670 --> 00:53:00,730
Okay. Start!

1058
00:53:03,590 --> 00:53:05,600
You guys can to go to them.

1059

[Invincible Hyori is eliminated]

1062
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:17,600
This doesn't make sense.

1063
00:53:19,100 --> 00:53:20,600
[However!]

1064
00:53:21,570 --> 00:53:24,650
[They attack an unsuspecting Suk Jin!]

1065
00:53:27,750 --> 00:53:29,640
[Falling down here and there]

1066
00:53:30,230 --> 00:53:32,940
You guys are really bad
at playing this game!

1067
00:53:34,610 --> 00:53:36,930
[Suk Jin even managed
to knock down two people.]

1068

[Those that have been
disqualified go to the back.]

1069
00:53:42,330 --> 00:53:44,260
They're really strong.

1070
00:53:44,300 --> 00:53:46,700
[But..]

1071
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:49,510
[The mood in front of
the human wave strategy...]

1072

[Currently surrounding HaHa!]

1073
00:53:54,300 --> 00:53:56,300
[And in the end, he is disqualified
because he didn't have power.]

1074
00:53:56,300 --> 00:53:58,200
[This time they concentrate on Suk Jin!]

1075
00:53:58,220 --> 00:54:00,060
[Eliminated without a pulse]

1076
00:54:00,060 --> 00:54:03,590

[Completely surrounded]

1078
00:54:09,060 --> 00:54:11,550
[They're coming all at once!]

1079

[Ok! I'm the rapper Gary!]

1080
00:54:16,260 --> 00:54:18,910
[Going head to head like a man]

1081
00:54:18,930 --> 00:54:21,940
[He's stuck!]

1082
00:54:25,100 --> 00:54:28,800
[The crushed rapper]

1083
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:30,950
The people who fell, please go to the back.

1084
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:34,000
Let's take a count of the people.

1085
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,900
Oppa! They're no joke.

1086

[11 members of the Citizen Team have been disqualified.]
The ones that have been disqualified are over there.

1088
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:47,200
[Expensive Team challenges!]

[Spearhead! They fierce fully attack
the muscle chicken]

[Without even a nod, a concentrated attack]

1095
00:55:10,900 --> 00:55:13,100
[You are amazing, Kim Jong Kook!]

1096
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:16,010
- Oppa!
- It's ok!

1097
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:20,300
[Jae Suk is out!]

1098
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:23,500
[Jae Suk is Jae Suk but...]

1099
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:25,800
[How did Kwang Soo...?]

1100
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:29,200
[Since running everywhere by himself]

1101
00:55:31,150 --> 00:55:33,470
[Just running back and he's eliminated]

1102
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:37,600
Don't step on me! Don't step on me!

1103
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,700
[Extreme sadness]

1104
00:55:40,900 --> 00:55:43,100
[What are you doing instead of coming out?]

1105
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:52,200
[He narrowly escapes!]

1106
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:54,100
That really hurt.

1107
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:55,700
Ugh, seriously!

1108
00:55:58,500 --> 00:56:00,800
[After Joong Ki was disqualified]

1109
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:02,800
[Jung Eum was disqualified.]

1110

[Now the only one left
is the muscle chicken!]

1111
00:56:05,980 --> 00:56:07,600
Win this, Oppa!

1112
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:11,200
[If you're going to throw yourself at me,
then come and throw all of yourselfs at once!]

[Jong Kook eventually was disqualified.]
- It really hurt.

1116
00:56:25,900 --> 00:56:29,400
You suffered a lot hyungnim!

1117
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:31,800
[Still, they were able
to get rid of 5 cizitens]

1118
00:56:31,860 --> 00:56:34,660
Jong Kook is not a human, he's a machine.

1119
00:56:34,700 --> 00:56:37,200
[Chicken fight machine]

1120
00:56:37,230 --> 00:56:41,860
- They hit here, and here.
- They're no joke, oppa!

1121
00:56:41,860 --> 00:56:43,620
Let's try and change our strategy.

1122
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:45,120
How about fighting one on one?

1123
00:56:45,130 --> 00:56:47,800
Shall we try and fighting one on one?

1124
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:50,950
The citizens should pick out
a member they wanna go up against.

1125
00:56:50,970 --> 00:56:53,730
- If you guys choose a member, then we'll...
- I want to compete with Jong Kook Hyungnim!

1126
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:56,700
- Whoa!
- Do you think you'll be ok?

1127
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:59,580
I was part of those
who remained from the game before.

1128
00:57:00,280 --> 00:57:02,150
[That chicken(?)
won't be easy to defeat though.]

1129
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:04,100
Fighting!

1130
00:57:04,100 --> 00:57:06,700
[Now, who will be the winner...?]
- Show him with one move!

1131
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:19,360
[Flying in mid air?]

1132
00:57:24,500 --> 00:57:26,100
Next person! Next person!

[Choi Kang Ja from
the Citizen Team has been KO-ed.]

1134

They're citizens!

1137
00:57:34,820 --> 00:57:37,480
Watch yourself!

1138
00:57:37,700 --> 00:57:40,300

Are you okay?

1141
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:56,300
Wait, wait.

1142
00:57:56,800 --> 00:57:58,700
[Even his shoulders]

1143
00:57:58,700 --> 00:58:00,790
Is it difficult?

1144
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:03,600
What are we gonna do about his shoulders?

1145
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:05,600
Leave!

1146
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:07,250
[Don't go, Mr. Jae Suk...]

1147
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:24,500
[The last player from
the Expensive Team, Kwang Soo.]

1148
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:31,500
[Within seconds, one member has fallen!]

1149

[Kwang speed! Chicken legs]

1150
00:58:34,300 --> 00:58:37,100
He's going for it! He's going for it!

1151
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:40,100
Why are his legs so thin!

1152

[Actively using his long legs!]

1153
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:53,300
[Kwang Soo wo... Huh?]

1154
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,900
[He just wins]

[And he just falls down]

1156

Ah, what should we do?

1158
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:11,990
Ok the cheap team!

1159
00:59:12,010 --> 00:59:13,950
Let's do a one on one too!

1160
00:59:13,980 --> 00:59:16,390
[The first opponent from
the Citizens Team is?]

1161

Take your hands out, Hyungnim!

1165
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:27,100

- Hyori! What do you think about Hyori?
- I'm a fan.

1175

[Unmatched! Hyori's aegyo strategy]

1178

No, we can fight like this and then-

1179
01:00:13,560 --> 01:00:15,400
She does it so naturally.

1180
01:00:17,500 --> 01:00:20,100
[Leg seems rusty]

1181
01:00:21,180 --> 01:00:24,280

[Public humiliation]

1183
01:00:26,860 --> 01:00:29,060
You lost too easily!

Don't get fooled by this!

1186

Don't be concerned
about these kinds of things.

Just until one person is left.

1209

[Cheap team has 2, expensive team has
3 so the expensive team wins!]

You're going to get up there and jump.

1580
01:21:51,190 --> 01:21:55,040
You jump and try
to get into the angle and win.

1581
01:21:55,050 --> 01:21:56,580
Let's do this!

1582

Isn't it photoshop?

1595
01:22:57,400 --> 01:22:59,700
I didn't know I would come out either.
