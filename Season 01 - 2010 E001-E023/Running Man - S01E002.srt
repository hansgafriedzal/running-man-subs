Why are you acting like you're so close with her?

79
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,600
You should call her "Song Ji Hyo" properly.

00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,600
- You should not treat surnames lightly!
- Do you like Ji Hyo?

He was the main guest last time, right?

89

For his sake, just for the time being let's not mention him.

90

- This is for his own good.
- Isn't it a little too early to be saying that?

The quicker you decide, the better!

92

You weren't his friend?

96
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:46,740
It was thrown next to me.

97
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:51,300
When I'm saying all this, he should take the cardigan away from me now.

98
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:55,240
Joong Ki doesn't seem to have that kind of vibe.

99

Joong Ki and I have different styles.

100
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:01,430

Alright, I think we're all here.

102
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:04,770
Let's get into teams.

103
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,000
Who was first?

104
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,500
Lee Kwang Soo.

[Lee Kwang Soo was the first to arrive!]

106
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,900
I want my priority to be democratic.

107
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:21,050
I want to know who are the people who want to be in the same team as me or not?

108
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:28,930
Maybe the weather is too hot. Our brains don't seem to be working properly.

109
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,900
Even though it's hot, who wants to be on my team?

110
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:37,120
Why don't you pick one of the girls first?

111
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:37,800
If that's the case then...

112
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:43,130
- Even though you two must be very nervous
- I'm not nervous at all.

113
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:47,200
[Taken aback]

114
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:52,010
- It's because Kwang Soo was trying to be polite.
- I'm sorry.

115
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,800
- I didn't mean anything by it.
- I want to pick Ji Hyo.

116
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,500
[Ji Hyo is Kwang Soo's first choice!]

117
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,200
Then next I pick...

118
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:02,960
I'm going to pick the next team member now.

119
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:05,110
Ha Ha!

120
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:11,900
- Why don't you let us know the reason?
- Why did you pick Ha Ha?

121
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:16,640
Because he's so cheerful and-

122
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:22,000
- As a person he doesn't get upset easily.
- Loosen up your necktie you'll be more comfortable.

123
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,400
I'm not going to pick you.

124
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:25,900
I'm not going to pick you.

125
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:31,730
This is the first time Kwang Soo said that he doesn't like to be criticized.

126
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,600
It's rare to see Kwang Soo showing his true colors!

127
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:39,200
It only happens when he's really mad.

128
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:43,900
Then why did you pick Ji Hyo out of Ji Hyo and Hara?

129
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:47,900
Hara and I don't seem to go well together.

130
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:52,900
You still have to pick two more members.

131
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:55,060
Yoo Jae Suk!

132
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,100
[Yoo Jae Suk is chosen!]

133
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,100
Why did you do that?

134
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,050
Gary!

135
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,800
[Gary is chosen!]

136
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,700
[Kwang Soo's choices are Ji Hyo, Haha, Jae Suk and Gary!]

137
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:06,870
Last time you said that we don't go well together.

138
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,300
[Flinches]

139
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:14,340
Even though we're not completely sure, the people standing on this side are the people who made Kwang Soo uncomfortable.

140
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:18,050
Rules of the new Running Man game.

141
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:21,060
As soon as all the entrances are open and the exits are locked, the mission starts.

142
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:27,010
All members must wait until the locks open up tomorrow. Only the group with the most money can leave.

143
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,600
There are two methods to getting cash!

144
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:32,520
First method-play a game to earn 500,000₩.

145
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:35,260
Second method-find cash filled golden piggy banks that are hidden in the stadium.

146
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:40,400
But the catch is the amount of money the piggie banks have will only be revealed right before you leave the stadium.

147
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:49,200
Who will get the most cash and be able to leave the stadium?

148
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:52,520
Mission start!

149
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,260
- And
- It's here.

150
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,600
[The instructions are here]

151
00:08:59,000 --> 00:08:59,800
I think I've been to that place before.

152
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:01,600
It says "Go to the Suwon World Cup Stadium."

153
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,700
Let's go.

154
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,900
[Home team: Jong Kook, Joong Ki, Chun Hee and Hara]

155
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
[Away team: Jae Suk, Gary, Ha Ha, Kwang Soo and Ji Hyo]

156
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:16,900
[The cars are entering the football player's specially reserved parking garage]

157
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,500
[Excited]

158
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,100
Thank you.

159
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:24,500
So this is where the professional league players enter the stadium.

160
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,500
[The exact spot where the Taeguk warriors get off their bus!]

161
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,800
Let's go in first.

162
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:33,780
I'm feeling a bit uncomfortable from nervousness.

163
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:34,900
Look at what's in front of us!

164
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
[This right here is the tunnel where the athletes enter]

165
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:39,600
Of course.

166
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:44,600
[Only players get to enter through this honorable tunnel]

167
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:48,600
[Running man enters]

168
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:56,000
[The official soccer ball will always be displayed every time you enter the field!]

169
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,700
[Exchanged with the golden piggie bank?!]

170
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:00,600
Because that's what our mission is based on.

171
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,100
Magnificent view! The spacious stadium.

172
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:12,400
[The second landmark is the Suwon World Cup stadium]

173
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:16,000

[How will our running man members escape from this gigantic field?]

175
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:28,000
[Touched]

176
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
This is so cool.

177
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,400
I think I'm supposed to enter with this.

178
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,700
Bring it in.

179
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,900
[Holding the golden pig like a soccer ball]

180
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,900
[Enters the ground field]

181
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:43,820
Let's go in!

182
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:49,000
[They actually need to compete in a race in this wide stadium]

183

[Sky cameras were also used in the 2010 Fifa world up in Africa]

184
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:56,300
[Interesting]

185
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:03,000
Today we're going to be doing a game that will last until tomorrow morning.

186
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,280
And we have to complete our mission here.

187
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:08,880
Suk jin is here.

188
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:13,720
- Why are you here?
- Running man!

189
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,300
[Suk Jin is late due to his schedule]

190
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,400
[The word "Bang!" appears again]

191
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:20,740
I heard that you weren't going to come.

192
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:24,150
So we told you last time that that kind of thing could happen.

193
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:28,600
That's why I hired a spy because I wanted to know how you would start the show.

194
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:32,110
I had a deep conversation with Gary.

195
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:38,700
- There's something that never ends, right?
- Wow your mouth got bigger in two weeks.

196
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,000
[At this moment]

197
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:44,190
It's coming out.

198
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:47,000
The exits are sealed.

199
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,800
We can't get out until tomorrow morning.

200
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,100
[It's happening again]

201
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,300

[Office gate]

204
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:02,000
[Even to the main gate, everything is completely locked!]

205
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,400
[Clueless]

206
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,000
That was the sign to let us know that we're starting.

207
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,800
Hello running man members.

208
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:13,440
I am the goal keeper for the South Korea national team

209
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:16,890
Jong Song Ryeong.

210
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:21,200
To the citizens who loves and supports our South Korean team, I would like to say thank you from the bottom of my heart.

211
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:27,360
Starting now, only the team that gets the most money can exit the stadium.

212
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:31,100
All the prize money will be donated to the soccer charity foundation.

213
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:34,300
So please try your best!

214
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:35,900
Good luck Running Man!

215
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:38,060
Good luck Song Joong Ki!

216
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,000
[With Jung Seong Ryung's encouragement, everyone's morale is boosted.]

217
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:48,900
Jung Seong Ryung said "Song Joong Ki, fighting." Do you do two know each other?

218
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,910
Jung Seong Ryong is the coach for our soccer club.

219
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,200
Ah, club soccer team.

220
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:55,780
I met him through that team.

221
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,500
[Wow I'm jealous]

222
00:12:57,510 --> 00:13:02,190
Just like Jung Song Ryung said, whoever get's the most amount of money gets to leave, right?

223
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,700
Alright! Please start giving out the hints.

224
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:09,900
So we really do need to find them.

225
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:15,100
[Video hint?]

226
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,600
[This match is..]

227
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,400
[2002 Fifa world cup South Korea. Round 16, facing italy]

228
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:26,000
[The goal from Ahn Jung Hwan lead his team to the quarter finals]

229
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:30,300
Isn't this the scene where they get into the quarter finals?

230
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:33,100
- Can you tell who it is?
- Ahn Jung Hwan

231
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
It was here?

232
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,360
Victory ball!

233
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:43,410
Then shouldn't the ball be over there? This is the ball that Ahn Jung Hwan won with.

234
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:46,800
Because it's the ball that won the match, there's a chance it's displayed somewhere in the stadium.

235
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,500
[The away team are already on the move]

236
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:54,200
I really don't know how to find this.

237
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:58,140
I really don't know where I can find it.

238
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:00,900
[They're acting like they're clueless but they already know the answer]

239
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:04,290
They still don't know the answer.

240
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:07,200
- They still don't know.
- We've figured it out already.

241
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,100
What if they already know the answer?

242
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:11,500
I'm going to go and get changed first, and I'll call you guys after.

243
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
[Meanwhile, the other team appears to be clueless]

244
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:20,120
There's a map over there.

245

[Discovered the map?]

246
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,400
[Without knowing the answer, the map is useless!]

247
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:26,900
Shall we go down again?

248

[The away team goes outside again]

249
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:31,400
Kwangsoo, where are you headed?

250
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,900
It might be hidden in a very difficult area.

251
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:39,800
- There should be a map around here somewhere.
- I don't think there'd be one?

252
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:43,200
It's over there.

253
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,170
It's right over there!

254
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:54,400
[Easily spotted the information directory]

[Out of service]

260
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:11,600
It's only one floor! Running would be faster.

261
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:14,710
What about Suk Jin?

262
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:17,160
Suk Jin should go down too.

263
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:19,460
To the first floor.

264
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:21,930
It wouldn't be good if the doors are locked.

265
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:24,700
[Would their prediction be the correct answer?]

266

[Meanwhile the away team searches the water drainage]

267

I've never thought of memorial halls or museums,

but there's nothing else other than that.

269
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:37,650
Let's hurry and go up there! This is just a water drainage.

270
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:40,150
I think I saw a memorial hall when I first entered here.

271
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:42,500
- We should hurry and run towards there.
- Where?

272

That's funny!

715

Ji-Hyo did well.

716
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:04,900
We have three team members in the photo.

717
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:13,030
I should have tried harder...

718
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,700
'Home' team wins!

719
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:17,900
Is there anything left to do now?
[A last-minute twist]

720
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:19,900
Let's have a game with just the ladies.
[A 1v1 face-off!]

721
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:22,700
[Hehe~]

722
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:25,100
You can win this! -She'll definitely win.
[Worried...]

723
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:28,500
The one who's captured jumping and smiling will win.

724
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:30,040
Players, enter the field!

725
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:31,400

[Trying to smile and block at the same time]

729
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,000
At first, it looks like they are dancing!

730
00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:48,880
Look at the camera! Look at the camera!

731
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:53,900
[When you look at it from a distance, it looks like a spectacle!]

732

[The shot is coming!]

733
00:43:04,690 --> 00:43:07,930

You can see her forehead!

739
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:22,000
You can also see Ji Hyo's hair!

740
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:24,890
[Both of them failed!]

741
00:43:24,910 --> 00:43:27,300
How about Gary and Sukjin Hyung?

742
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:30,270
Shall we do a jump shot?

743
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:33,070
We have to be in the right timing. Right?

744
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:35,730
[First, look for the right angle.]

745
00:43:35,770 --> 00:43:38,170
It's funny already!

746

[Practicing the peaceful expression]

747
00:43:42,330 --> 00:43:45,160
Who will have a more peaceful expression?

748
00:43:45,190 --> 00:43:47,870
It's like your not jumping.
That kind of expression.

749
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:50,100
[Can I win over Gary?]
I believe in Gary.

750
00:43:50,150 --> 00:43:51,630
This means nothing to me.

751
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:55,670
Gary doesn't really look like an entertainer.

752
00:43:55,690 --> 00:43:58,290

[Suk Jin Shot.]

760
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:20,400
- You have to smile.
- Make a natural expression, a natural expression.

761
00:44:21,890 --> 00:44:23,570
[Both are slow to warm up.]

762
00:44:27,290 --> 00:44:28,920
[Almost time to shoot!]

763
00:44:30,370 --> 00:44:31,610
[Everything depends on this moment!

- Oh?
- Shh!

791
00:46:30,310 --> 00:46:37,830
Now, the bus to the swimming pool can be reached through the route to the right.

792
00:46:37,870 --> 00:46:40,790
You need to get to the bus quickly.

- Isn't this the right color?
- It should be blue.

801
00:47:10,010 --> 00:47:11,620
Is it a soccer uniform?

802
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:15,900

Seems like it'd be here.

809

What is "your most important person"?

810
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:44,100
It doesn't seem to have a particular meaning.

811
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:46,800
- Then we need to start by finding clues.
- Oh, blue!

812

[ Searching carefully, trying to find the swimsuits ]

829
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:32,000
The word " Precious " seems to have a special meaning.

00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:34,130
- No. I don't think so.
- There are still some more changing rooms over there.

I found the other team's swimsuit,

881
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:54,500
but we need to find ours.

882
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:58,600
- Jae Suk, where are you?
- He's with me.

883
00:52:08,870 --> 00:52:10,490
[Gary starts to walk faster.]

884
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:14,600
I found it!

885
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:22,400
Is it the right color?

886
00:52:25,150 --> 00:52:28,230
[They found their team's swimsuit outside of the Ruby Room.]

887
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:35,500
Hyung, we found it. Hurry, hurry!

888
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:38,300
The Away Team is the first to gather.

889
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:41,500
[The shuttle arrives in one minute!]

890
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:45,600
Found it! Found it!

891
00:52:49,710 --> 00:52:52,480
Jihyo's the one who found it.
[VIP Room Search's hero, Jihyo.]

892
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:55,600
It's thanks to Ji Hyo.

893
00:52:55,650 --> 00:52:57,760
[The fateful, Spring-like meeting of Ji Hyo.]

894
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:03,400
[Meanwhile, Joong Ki and Hara saw everything.]
That team seems to have found their swimsuits.

895
00:53:05,700 --> 00:53:08,200
- Hurry!
- Take the bus, take the bus!

896
00:53:10,900 --> 00:53:13,100
[Unexpected Meeting.]

897
00:53:13,730 --> 00:53:15,700
Wait a second, let's talk for a bit.

898
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:18,190
Wait.

899
00:53:18,220 --> 00:53:20,480
[Pretending...]
Hurry and find your swimsuits.

900
00:53:20,490 --> 00:53:22,040
- Hold on for a second
- You guys should go look for it.

901
00:53:22,060 --> 00:53:24,140
[Home team's swimsuits.]

902
00:53:26,900 --> 00:53:28,100
[Without a walkie talkie, they can't do anything...]

903
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:32,000
[The shuttle arrives!]
You guys can't go on now.

904
00:53:34,300 --> 00:53:36,800
[The Away Team is stopped by Joong Ki and Hara.]

905
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:42,400
[We also wanted to find our swimsuits...]
We can leave once we all get on.

906
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:47,800
We worked really hard to find this.

907
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:51,450
Run over me!

908
00:53:53,650 --> 00:53:55,130
Catch the next bus!

909
00:53:55,170 --> 00:53:58,110
[The next bus comes in 10 minutes...]

910
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:01,300
We're leaving!

911
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,800
- Don't be like this!
- Joong Ki, see you later!

912
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:05,800
- See you later!

913
00:54:10,300 --> 00:54:11,900
[Catch your swimbag!]

914
00:54:11,930 --> 00:54:13,680
[Fooled!]

915
00:54:17,500 --> 00:54:20,100
[Complete Success.]

916
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:26,560
[The smiling winner, Ji Hyo!]

917
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:30,830
[The golden piggy banks and more await them at the swimming pool.]

918
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:32,510
Where did the hyungs go?

919
00:54:32,540 --> 00:54:34,430
Where is it?

920
00:54:35,430 --> 00:54:40,210
[Working hard on the fourth floor.]

921
00:54:41,390 --> 00:54:42,320
You guys found it?

922
00:54:42,350 --> 00:54:44,740
- Where did you go?
- They already left!

923
00:54:44,780 --> 00:54:46,100
- What?

924
00:54:46,130 --> 00:54:49,300
They took both of them and we couldn't get on the bus.

925
00:54:49,310 --> 00:54:53,890
- We have to wait for ten more minutes.
- Is this ours?

926
00:54:53,910 --> 00:54:55,960
They tossed it to us after leaving.

927
00:54:56,020 --> 00:54:58,450
Where did you find it?

928
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:00,910
Why didn't you contact us?

929
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:02,530
They didn't have the walkie talkies.

930
00:55:02,530 --> 00:55:04,280
So, we couldn't contact you guys.

931
00:55:04,290 --> 00:55:06,100
In my opinion, it's his fault.

932
00:55:06,130 --> 00:55:10,930
If we're late by 10 minutes, how badly will that affect us?

933
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:15,200
Since the other team already left, they might find the piggy banks in the first ten minutes.

934
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:18,100
Can we save time by changing into our swimsuits here?

935
00:55:18,170 --> 00:55:21,730
What if we miss the bus while we're changing?

936
00:55:21,770 --> 00:55:23,090
That's the worst case scenario.

937
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:24,630
Let's just go ahead and change.

938
00:55:24,650 --> 00:55:26,640
Hurry up and change.

939
00:55:26,670 --> 00:55:28,530
[Quickly changes into the swimsuits.]

940
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:37,400
It looks like we just broke out of prison...

941
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:39,900
[Looks like a pile of prison outfits.]

942
00:55:39,910 --> 00:55:41,170
It's here, it's here!

943
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:43,630
Joong Ki! Hurry!

944
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:45,600
Wait just a second! I'm putting on my underwear.

945
00:55:49,250 --> 00:55:50,550
Joong Ki!

946
00:55:50,570 --> 00:55:51,770
Where is he?

947
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:53,700
Hurry up.

948
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,100
Alright, let's go.

949
00:55:55,100 --> 00:55:57,600
[The Home Team Gets on the Bus]

950
00:55:57,600 --> 00:55:59,800
[To the Swimming Pool!]

951
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,400
[The Away Team Arrives First.]

952
00:56:04,410 --> 00:56:05,430
We should hurry!

953
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:09,100
[Quickly put on the swimsuits and rush to the pool.]

954
00:56:10,220 --> 00:56:12,420
[The gigantic pool after closing hours.]

955
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:15,300
Why are we here?

956
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:24,140
[They discover the golden pig on the diving board!]

957
00:56:24,150 --> 00:56:26,170
[First to catch me will be the owner! Hurry up!]

958
00:56:26,210 --> 00:56:28,160
Why is it up there?

959
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:32,300
- But how do we get up there?
- Just go up and grab it.

960
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:40,400
[Haha heads up the 3.5 meter platform.]
Ah, how do I do this?

961
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,900
[Jae Suk heads toward the 10 meter platform.]

962
00:56:44,300 --> 00:56:46,900
Oh, I'm really scared now.

963
00:56:46,900 --> 00:56:47,970
Do we need to go further?

964
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,800
[Ji Hyo easily reaches the 10 meter platform.]

965
00:56:52,980 --> 00:56:54,570
[First two to arrive at the platforms.]

966
00:56:57,380 --> 00:56:59,330
[Alone on the shaking diving board.]
Hold on to this and stop shaking.

967
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:04,700
What do we do if it falls?

968
00:57:05,100 --> 00:57:07,000
If it falls, grab it and fall with it!

969
00:57:08,100 --> 00:57:11,300
[Will the timid Kwang Soo have enough courage?]

970
00:57:20,010 --> 00:57:23,180
[He only needs to reach out his hand...]

971
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:25,330
[Kwang Soo acquires one piggy bank!]

972
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:28,070
[Timid third person claps behind them.]

973
00:57:28,900 --> 00:57:31,600
[The Away Team leads with one piggy bank!]

974
00:57:32,980 --> 00:57:35,600
[Meanwhile, at the 10 meter platform...]

975
00:57:35,700 --> 00:57:38,200
[Just getting to that height was difficult!]
- Are you not scared?

976
00:57:39,030 --> 00:57:40,290
You aren't scared?

977
00:57:42,300 --> 00:57:43,320
Can you reach it?

978
00:57:43,330 --> 00:57:45,290
[Dizzy.]

979
00:57:45,310 --> 00:57:46,000
Can you reach it?

980
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,300
[Kwang Soo is also scared to get close to the edge.]

981
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:50,230
[Taking large steps.]

982
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:54,400
Hey, be careful!
[Grabs]

983
00:57:57,060 --> 00:57:59,560
[Ji Hyo grabs the second pig.]
Are you still not scared?

984
00:57:59,580 --> 00:58:02,090
[Ji Hyo who loses all the time is not scared.]

985
00:58:02,120 --> 00:58:04,120
I'm still scared.

986
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:06,800
You have no fear. Can you walk to the edge?
[Kwang Soo stands at the edge, looking for another pig.]

987
00:58:08,910 --> 00:58:10,560
Oh, there's one over there!

988
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:21,900
[Hehehe.]

989
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:24,470
Let's get down first.

990
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:26,700
Where is it?

991
00:58:27,860 --> 00:58:29,400
I'm going.

992
00:58:29,430 --> 00:58:31,610
Hurry, hurry!

993
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:32,960
[Ji Hyo supervises from the platform.]

994
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:34,700
Where are they?

995
00:58:34,710 --> 00:58:36,230
Go over there!

996
00:58:36,260 --> 00:58:38,370
Where Haha is standing!

997
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:40,300
[Inside the water?]

998
00:58:41,900 --> 00:58:43,800
[There's a golden pig at the bottom of the pool!]

999
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:45,510
[Splash!]

1000
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:47,800
[Kwang Soo goes in.]

1001
00:58:48,300 --> 00:58:49,300
Do you know how to swim?

1002
00:58:51,250 --> 00:58:52,750
It's really deep over there.

1003
00:58:52,750 --> 00:58:54,460
[Something is there!]

1004
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:56,310
Do you know how to swim?

1005
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:58,400
Are there swimming goggles?

1006
00:58:59,110 --> 00:59:01,010
Kwang Soo, move over there a bit.

1007
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:04,040
[Getting closer.]

1008
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:05,800
[It's down there!]

1009
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:08,200
I'll go down and help!

1010
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:12,000
[Haha jumps into the pool.]

1011
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,300
[Jae Suk joins the two as well.]

1012
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:16,590
[If they get this one, they'll have three.]

1013
00:59:22,250 --> 00:59:24,100
[The golden object is very far down.]

1014
00:59:24,100 --> 00:59:27,500
How deep is this? Five meters?!

1015
00:59:33,480 --> 00:59:34,970
[Very serious.]

1016
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:38,590
[Ji Hyo runs to help the guys.]

1017
00:59:38,630 --> 00:59:39,890
[Provides swimming goggles!]

1018
00:59:41,900 --> 00:59:43,300
Fighting! Fighting!

1019
00:59:43,300 --> 00:59:45,400
Jihyo, take care of the pigs!

1020
00:59:49,550 --> 00:59:51,850
At this time, the Home Team arrives ten minutes late.

1021
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:53,500
Hara's here. Oh they're here!

1022
00:59:54,900 --> 00:59:57,100
- Oppa, oppa!
- What's happening?

1023
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,300
Is there something in there?

1024
01:00:01,300 --> 01:00:03,100
Go!

1025
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:05,300
Chun Hee dives into the water.

1026
01:00:11,890 --> 01:00:13,810
- It's somewhere in the swimming pool.
- Where is it?

1027
01:00:13,850 --> 01:00:16,050
[Jong Kook also enters!]

1028
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
[Just like before, going close below is difficult]

1029
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,300
[It's down there, but it's somewhat dificult to reach...]

1030
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:26,600
[Even if you have a scuba diving certification]

1031
01:00:26,620 --> 01:00:27,750
[Whoosh]

1032
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:31,700
[Energy zero!]

1033
01:00:34,300 --> 01:00:37,500
[Kwang Soo tries again]

1034
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:40,200
Why do you keep taking off your clothes?

1035
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:42,700
[By any chance if you have a naked body will it be possible to go close?]

1036
01:00:43,900 --> 01:00:46,300
[As expected. A pointless expectation...]

1037
01:00:47,860 --> 01:00:51,120
[Jong Kook tried one more time[

1038
01:00:51,180 --> 01:00:52,950
[Tries to submerge in the deep!]

1039
01:00:56,200 --> 01:00:57,800
[Oh?! That is...?]

1040
01:01:02,530 --> 01:01:06,900
[Something... is strange]

1041
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:10,500
This isn't a pig?

1042
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:14,420
[Kwang Soo hears this and reconfirms]

1043
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:19,500
[By chance, there's a ball on the bottom of the swimming pool]

1044
01:01:19,500 --> 01:01:21,200
It's not a pig!

1045
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:22,700
It's not a pig?

1046
01:01:23,500 --> 01:01:26,500
It was pink!

1047
01:01:28,470 --> 01:01:30,220
[The home team moves on to find another pig]

1048
01:01:32,700 --> 01:01:34,500
What is this?

1049
01:01:38,820 --> 01:01:41,080
[There's really a golden pig!]

1050
01:01:41,100 --> 01:01:45,500
[Diving Pool]

1051
01:01:48,100 --> 01:01:50,000
[Haha's one man challenge!]

1052
01:01:52,340 --> 01:01:54,870
[without any obstacle, goes deep]

1053
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,400
[This time it's surely a pig!]

1054
01:02:05,450 --> 01:02:08,170
First take a deep breath of air and hold your nose.

1055
