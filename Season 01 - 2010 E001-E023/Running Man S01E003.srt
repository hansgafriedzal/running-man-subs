Give me some money.

849
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:00,900
- When you're arguing with someone and extremely mad, what would you say?
- I will destroy you!

850
00:46:00,910 --> 00:46:04,180
- In hometown legends, which lines come out the most?
- So noisy!

851
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:08,070
- What do the policemen say when they've captures a criminal?
- I curse you!

852
00:46:08,130 --> 00:46:11,820
- What do the policemen say when they've captures a criminal?
- I curse you!

853
00:46:11,850 --> 00:46:16,290
- In Song Dae Kwan's "Popular song" what is the popular lyrics?
- Because of you I can't accomplish anything!

854
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:20,810
- In college times in the street alleys what do the scary sunbaes say the most?
- Give me back my leg!

855
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:22,600
[Time out.]
[Away team, zero points]

856
00:46:22,620 --> 00:46:25,900
So the most popular phrase among college these days is "give me back my leg."

857
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:28,800
No wonder I heard it so many times.

858
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:31,490
You should say it in a loud voice.
[Dumbfounded]

859
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:34,800
- Let's do well!
- I think we work well together.
-I[Home Team: Joong Ki and Jong Kook]

860
00:46:34,820 --> 00:46:38,150
- Yeah, that's right Joong Ki.
- Jong Kook, your shoulders are too narrow.

861
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:39,730
It's not like this originally. What's up with this?

862
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:42,500
Do it in a loud voice! Loud voice!

863
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:44,600
So you can't hear?

864
00:46:44,930 --> 00:46:47,400
Ready... Start!

865
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:49,900
What do you want to say to the person you hate?

866
00:46:49,930 --> 00:46:52,000
Constipation!

867
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:56,500
- What do you want to say to the person you hate?
- Constipation!
[To the person you hate... constipation?]

868
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:59,410
What do you call it when your face is red and crumples up due to your inability to poop?

869
00:46:59,450 --> 00:47:01,400
Cow!

870
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:03,460
Hyung, this is a very famous proverb.

871
00:47:03,490 --> 00:47:07,400
What are you deprived of and need to fix the stable?

872
00:47:07,420 --> 00:47:09,840
A Mongolian spot!

873
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:15,000
[You are deprived of a Mongolian spot and you should fix the stable!]
<i>- It's a proverb saying that we need to be careful about everything.</i>

874
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,870
What do we need to tap on to cross over?

875
00:47:16,890 --> 00:47:18,730
Rice cake!

876
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:24,990
- They didn't even get one right.
- What is the reason for Jong Kook's crazy workout routine?

877
00:47:25,030 --> 00:47:27,010
Fart!

878
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:30,600
[Jong Kook has been hiding it all this time...]

879
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:32,900
[But he works out so hard because of farts...?]

880
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:38,700
You meet someone after a long time but you forgot their name. What would you say in place of their name?

881
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:40,410
Muscle!

882
00:47:40,450 --> 00:47:42,680
When your insides aren't good,

883
00:47:42,710 --> 00:47:44,610
what is the gas that your body lets out?

884
00:47:44,620 --> 00:47:46,770
A stone bridge!

885
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:51,200
- We did it!
- What are the spots that appear on new born babies?

886
00:47:51,220 --> 00:47:53,110
Constipation!

887
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:55,900
[Time out]

888
00:47:57,260 --> 00:47:58,980
- That's good!
- Hey!

889
00:47:58,980 --> 00:48:03,110
Hey! How could you be deprived of a Mongolian spot and fix the barn?

890
00:48:05,100 --> 00:48:06,400
You didn't get any of them correct.

891
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:09,910
So for this telepathy game,

892
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,500
the home team wins!
[The home team wins and gets ₩500,000]

893
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:14,920
- Whoa.
[The home team wins and gets ₩500,000]

894
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:20,600
[The amount of golden piggy banks acquires so far]

895
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:25,400
<i>Entrances and exits are locked.</i>

896
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:28,690
- I found it!
[The amount of piggy banks the team has acquired so far ]

897
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:32,000
[The amount of money they've collected from the piggy banks: Home team: ₩150,000 and ₩100,000]

898
00:48:32,020 --> 00:48:35,130
[In order to escape, they've been fiercely running for 13 hours!

899
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:37,200
[And finally, the ₩500,000 final mission!]

900
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:40,300
[Been locked up for 13 hours]

901
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:45,300
[Both teams enter the interior]

902
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:48,900
Come in. Come in.
[The last game will be spread out in this place?]

903
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:52,400
- Put it here.
- Please be careful.

904
00:48:52,420 --> 00:48:57,360
But indoors is much better than outdoors.

905
00:48:59,570 --> 00:49:06,660
- So they come in here to warm up.
[This is a warm up room. The players come in here to warm up before every match.]

906
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:11,400
The athletes need to warm up before any competition or practice.

907
00:49:11,430 --> 00:49:15,520
But we already warmed up a little outside, why are we here to sweat in here?

908
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:20,000
Hara has been having a lot of schedules in Japan. You must be really tired right now.

909
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:25,200
- No.
- Though there isn't any one of us who has had a busy schedule like Hara.

910
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,700
[Mr. Suk Jin] What are you doing tomorrow?

911
00:49:27,700 --> 00:49:29,700
I'm resting.

912
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:32,580
[A very productive(?) schedule of Suk Jin.]

913
00:49:32,630 --> 00:49:37,090
Hara really hasn't looked at Suk Jin not once.

914
00:49:37,110 --> 00:49:38,860
- She doesn't even take one glance at you.
- That was hilarious.

915
00:49:38,910 --> 00:49:42,080
Hey, I can draw the back of your skull.

916
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:44,350
I can draw the back of your skull.

917
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:46,100
- Hey, you seriously.
[Suk Jin is looking at the back of Hara's head.]

918
00:49:46,100 --> 00:49:51,210
One team will have a goal keeper hanging from the pole, the other team will try to score.

919
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:54,800
Each member needs to try to make a goal. Who ever has the most goals wins.

920
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:56,400
So, this game is simple isn't it?

921
00:49:56,500 --> 00:49:58,200
[The goal keeper is extremely important.]

922
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:01,600
Haha wont be able to block anything under it.

923
00:50:01,620 --> 00:50:04,530
- How much longer are you going to poke fun at my height?
[Very sensitive talking about his height.]

924
00:50:04,570 --> 00:50:06,930
Then shall we talk about your girlfriend?

925
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:09,400
Then do you not have a girlfriend?

926
00:50:09,420 --> 00:50:12,030
- While I know everything.
[Haha vs: Jong Kook. Which an unseasonable heated battle]

927
00:50:12,060 --> 00:50:13,870
You have a girlfriend too!

928
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:15,200
- Hey!
[In a fit of rage]

929
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:17,300
- Am I wrong?
- Just stop it.

930
00:50:17,340 --> 00:50:19,530
<i>Seems like you had a bad break up?</i>

931
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:24,400
Even though two people keep going back and forth at it,

932
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:27,930
We know what we need to know. It's not something we don't know.

933
00:50:27,930 --> 00:50:31,430
But, Haha are you really okay?

934
00:50:31,460 --> 00:50:33,830
Are you annoyed?

935
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:36,700
- Your tone of voice...
[An annoyed tone]

936
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:39,700
Why? This is originally how I talk!

937
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:42,590
[Who was Jong Kook's girlfriend?]

938
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:44,400
[I don't know.]

939
00:50:44,420 --> 00:50:49,160
Suk Jin, just said. "Excuse me but who was his girlfriend?"

940
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:53,900
- Why did you say that to Hara?
- Well.. Because she's an idol.
[The man in his 40's is curious about celebrity talk!]

941
00:50:53,910 --> 00:50:56,880
- Jong Kook
- I thought Hara would know.

942
00:50:57,700 --> 00:51:00,400
The first round is for a minute.

943
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:04,200
We'll count how many goals we get in. We really have to win this time.
[Which ever team makes the most points wins.]

944
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:06,150
So does your team

945
00:51:06,170 --> 00:51:09,360
- want to block first?
- No, we're going to kick first.

946
00:51:09,390 --> 00:51:12,180
[He's not being fooled]

947
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:15,300
- We want to kick first.
- You think really quickly.

948
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:17,600
Your friend over there doesn't seem to know.
[The friend who doesn't know.]

949
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:20,550
Suk Jin wasn't fooled.

950
00:51:20,550 --> 00:51:23,040
He's a person that came out on Sparta season 2.

951
00:51:23,060 --> 00:51:26,730
[SpartaKook?]
He came out on Sparta season 2.

952
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:30,350
Okay, we have chosen our first goal keeper. It's Lee Kwang Soo.
[Away team's goal keeper Lee Kwang Soo.]

953
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,100
This is a hard ball.

954
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:34,770
Hey, Kwang Soo

955
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:39,000
Kwang Soo block it! Fighting!
[So long...]

956
00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:41,700
Kwang Soo, fighting!

957
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:44,530
[The dignity of a 190 cm person]

958
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:48,250
Ready, go!
[Home team round one start!]

959
00:51:49,900 --> 00:51:51,400
[Blocked it!]

960
00:51:51,420 --> 00:51:53,110
That's good!

961
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:54,390
Ah!

962
00:51:57,700 --> 00:52:00,000
[Even the second player Joong Ki fails]

963
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:03,600
Come out! Run!

964
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:08,100
[They've been overpowered by his height? They still haven't made one goal yet!]

965
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:10,600
They haven't even made it one goal!

966
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:12,700
[They're running about in confusion]

967
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:15,400
[Did he block it?]

968
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:16,840
[Goal!]

969
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:19,800
[Finally, this is Jong Kook's first goal!]

970
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:22,200
[Did he catch it?[

971
00:52:22,220 --> 00:52:24,470
[The good blocker Kwang Soo!]

972
00:52:25,930 --> 00:52:28,670
It's blocked!

973
00:52:28,970 --> 00:52:30,150
[Hits.]

974
00:52:30,850 --> 00:52:32,690
[Hits him.]
Ah what?

975
00:52:32,730 --> 00:52:34,590
Catch the ball!

976
00:52:34,590 --> 00:52:36,400
[Hits.]

977
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:38,500
Hey what?

978
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:41,360
Just a minute.

979
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:44,000
[Hara makes the next goal for the home team!]

980
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:46,800
- That's good.
[This time SukJin makes the third goal!]

981
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:48,700
- Hyung, this is so hard.
- I know.

982
00:52:48,700 --> 00:52:51,540
[Home team has succeeded, making three goals.]

983
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:53,600
How much was that?

984
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:58,000
- That team kicks really lousy, don't they?
- Yeah.
[Home team's goal keeper is JoongKi.]

985
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,100
We shouldn't kick like that.

986
00:53:00,100 --> 00:53:01,900
- One by one.
- How are you going to kick?

987
00:53:01,910 --> 00:53:03,710
- We're going to kick one by one.
- Really?

988
00:53:03,740 --> 00:53:05,530
- We're going for it!
- The bottom.

989
00:53:05,570 --> 00:53:07,090
We're going for it!

990
00:53:07,150 --> 00:53:09,880
- The bottom is too empty.
- <i>Start!</i>

991
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:12,700
- One by one.
- Slowly.

992
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:15,600
[Did he block it?]

993
00:53:15,620 --> 00:53:16,960
Wow!
[Goal!]

994
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,100
[Short! Just passed through~]

995
00:53:25,100 --> 00:53:28,000
[Gary also shoots in the same way]

996
00:53:29,450 --> 00:53:32,390
[KwangSoo's legs are bottomless so he could prevent goals.]

997
00:53:32,450 --> 00:53:34,670
[Flower boy JoongKi's humiliation.]

998
00:53:34,710 --> 00:53:38,070
[The size difference.]

999
00:53:40,020 --> 00:53:41,710
We won!

1000
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:43,800
[Away team has successfully made 4 goals.]

1001
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:46,900
[Home team 0, away team 1.]

1002
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:48,800
- How about we go for a total?
- What kind?

1003
00:53:48,820 --> 00:53:52,380
The total points. Anyway, if we win we'll have to do it one more time.

1004
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:55,200
- [In informal speech] We have to do it one more time.
- Excuse me

1005
00:53:55,230 --> 00:53:58,860
- We should speak more formally.
- Okay
[You spoke too informally]

1006
00:53:58,910 --> 00:54:01,230
- It's ok, it's nothing.
[Suk Jin quickly acknowledges it]

1007
00:54:01,300 --> 00:54:04,600
- It's because I'm a bit impatient.
- Yes, even though you're a hyung.

1008
00:54:04,620 --> 00:54:08,780
Although in variety shows these days we do speak comfortably, it was a bit weird when you did it.

1009
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:15,500
I always feel this. That you guys are really close.

1010
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:18,990
Besides me, you all look really close.

1011
00:54:19,030 --> 00:54:21,440
So what do you think we should do?

1012
00:54:21,450 --> 00:54:24,160
Let's kick ten balls.

1013
00:54:24,180 --> 00:54:26,410
- 10.
- Let's go with 10.

1014
00:54:26,450 --> 00:54:29,700
If both teams end up in a tie,

1015
00:54:29,730 --> 00:54:32,540
then Joong Ki and HaHa will go at it(as a goal keeper) one more time.

1016
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:36,900
- Hyung, I'm tall.
- I know.
[The excited flower boy Joong Ki]

1017
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:39,430
- I'm taller than this hyung!
- I know.
[He doesn't like the thought that he's a same height as HaHa]

1018
00:54:39,450 --> 00:54:41,810
Joong Ki, you're not that tall.

1019
00:54:41,810 --> 00:54:43,880
Go and compete Joong Ki.

1020
00:54:43,900 --> 00:54:45,900
[Round 2 start!]

1021
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:49,570
- Ready..
- KwangSoo Fighting!
[This time again KwangSoo is the goal keeper.]

1022
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:51,900
[The first kicker is Jong Kook]

1023
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,300
Start!

1024
00:54:53,300 --> 00:54:55,600
[As expected, a jam packed goal post]

1025
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:58,200
- 10?
The direction. Think about it.

1026
00:54:58,220 --> 00:55:00,720
There's also speed.

1027
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:06,100
[Kim Jong Kook fails.]

1028
00:55:08,300 --> 00:55:10,100
Kwang Soo fighting!

1029
00:55:10,120 --> 00:55:12,230
- His legs are longer than we expected
- Kwang Soo!

1030
00:55:12,260 --> 00:55:14,250
Kwang Soo, I like what you're doing.

1031
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:16,130
[The next kicker is Song Joong Ki.]

1032
00:55:16,170 --> 00:55:18,790
Kwang Soo is good.

1033
00:55:19,250 --> 00:55:21,270
Okay!
[He powerfully gets a goal!]

1034
00:55:24,100 --> 00:55:25,600
Okay!

1035
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:29,100
[Just wait and see...]

1036
00:55:29,110 --> 00:55:30,580
Look at where he got it in.

1037
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:32,450
To get a goal from there is hard.

1038
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:35,470
[The fact that he was able to make it in between his two arms makes it even more fascinating]

1039
00:55:35,470 --> 00:55:37,450
How many is that?

1040
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:38,900
Fighting!

1041
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:43,100
[The course where he can block it?]

1042
00:55:43,100 --> 00:55:45,470
[Suk Jin gets a clean goal!]

1043
00:55:47,900 --> 00:55:49,600
Wasn't that cool?

1044
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:51,930
[That was funny...]

1045
00:55:51,970 --> 00:55:53,810
[This time it's Hara's turn.]

1046
00:55:53,900 --> 00:55:55,400
- That's it! That's it!
- Ah!
[Ah! It could've been a goal...]

1047
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:57,700
That's it! That's it!

1048
00:55:58,400 --> 00:55:59,900
[Extremely fortunate]

1049
00:55:59,930 --> 00:56:02,110
Now, the last one.

1050
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:04,400
[The last runner: Chun Hee]

1051
00:56:04,430 --> 00:56:07,040
Do it slowly.

1052
00:56:07,100 --> 00:56:08,900
[Take this!]

1053
00:56:08,910 --> 00:56:11,090
[I can block it!]

1054
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,100
[It went in!]

1055
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:21,100
-3 of them didn't go in!
- That's okay.
[The second round is complete. The Home Team succeeds in getting 7 goals]

1056
00:56:21,130 --> 00:56:25,530
- Wow, a lot of it went in.
- It's okay.

1057
00:56:25,550 --> 00:56:27,650
Cheon Hee fighting!
[This time Cheon Hee is the goal keeper for the home team.]

1058
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:31,300
[Chun Hee dangling on there is also imposing]

1059
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:34,200
It looks like Lee Chun Hee is just a little bit shorter.

1060
00:56:34,220 --> 00:56:37,080
- He's just a little bit short.
[Narrowly doesn't touch the bottom]

1061
00:56:37,130 --> 00:56:38,750
[Away team, round two start!]

1062
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:40,600
[This time Haha starts first.]

1063
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:41,600
Ah!

1064
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:43,700
[He shoots with his strong right leg!]

1065
00:56:46,300 --> 00:56:47,800
- Gary
- Gary fighting.
[Up next is the trendy rapper Gary]

1066
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:49,450
[This time it's mainstream rapper Gary.]

1067
00:56:49,510 --> 00:56:51,720
[Gary also succeeds.]

1068
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:56,600
That was good!
[That's strange]

1069
00:56:56,640 --> 00:57:00,150
[Delicate two legs, small hearted, Lee KwangSoo.]

1070
00:57:00,700 --> 00:57:03,100
- Kwang Soo, you can do it.
- You can do it.
[I'm just going to block you!]

1071
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:05,190
[Oh!]

1072
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:09,600
[He blocked it!]

1073
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:13,000
[The Klutz wins!]

1074
00:57:13,700 --> 00:57:15,400
[This time it's MC Yoo.]

1075
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:17,100
Don't do it.

1076
00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:22,300
[First his body, then the goal post. No goal!]

1077
00:57:22,300 --> 00:57:24,300
[The shining star goal keeper CheonHee.]

1078
00:57:24,300 --> 00:57:27,600
- Wow.
- Yay!
[However in a while...]

1079
00:57:27,610 --> 00:57:29,550
Chun Hee is losing his strength.

1080
00:57:29,570 --> 00:57:32,030
Chun Hee lost his strength.

1081
00:57:32,060 --> 00:57:33,990
Isn't this even more difficult?
[Tearing scissors?]

1082
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:36,370
He's out of it already.

1083
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:38,410
Gary! This is your chance!

1084
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:40,700
The last kicker is going to be Ji Hyo.

1085
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:42,900
[He coolly succeeds]

1086
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:44,540
[Floundering]

1087
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:47,460
[Hot on their trail!]

1088
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:51,170
- Chun Hee!
- Just block one!

1089
00:57:51,170 --> 00:57:54,080
All you have to do is just block one.

1090
00:57:54,090 --> 00:57:56,680
I have been blocking it.

1091
00:57:56,720 --> 00:57:58,410
- If Ji Hyo gets it in we have a tie..
[If Ji Hyo succeeds then it will be a tie.]

1092
00:57:58,450 --> 00:58:01,310
If Ji Hyo gets it in then we'll have a tie.

1093
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:03,710
- Fighting!
- Let's do this.
[The Away Team's fate is up to Ji Hyo's feet]

1094
00:58:04,230 --> 00:58:07,220
[Chun Hee is also turning over a new leaf... Huh?]

1095
00:58:07,250 --> 00:58:08,660
[Klutz]

1096
00:58:08,700 --> 00:58:12,290
Can't we change the goal keeper?

1097
00:58:12,340 --> 00:58:14,550
We all have the same circumstances.

1098
00:58:14,570 --> 00:58:16,600
I'm going in like this!

1099
00:58:16,630 --> 00:58:18,540
It can't be helped.

1100
00:58:18,610 --> 00:58:21,040
We have the same circumstances!

1101
00:58:21,100 --> 00:58:24,500
- Was it slippery earlier?
- I also did it like that, hyung.

1102
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:26,500
- It could be slippery.
- Good.

1103
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:28,600
[Slips~]

1104
00:58:29,470 --> 00:58:32,070
- It could be slippery.
- Good.

1105
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:36,000
[It's been a while... Chun Hee's signature body gag!]

1106
00:58:36,020 --> 00:58:38,630
[Can the game end...]

1107
00:58:39,130 --> 00:58:41,110
- Good.
- This seems slippery.
[He did grab on to it...]

1108
00:58:42,660 --> 00:58:44,640
- The last ball.
- That's it!

1109
00:58:44,650 --> 00:58:46,270
- That's it!
[Surprised]

1110
00:58:46,330 --> 00:58:48,690
That's good Ji Hyo.
[You're doing well Ji Hyo]

1111
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:50,600
That's it!

1112
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:54,100
[Argh!]

1113
00:58:54,810 --> 00:58:56,410
[Shoots right away]

1114
00:58:58,100 --> 00:59:00,800
[5 goals in a row? If she succeeds it's a tie!]

1115
00:59:02,300 --> 00:59:04,300
[Legs! I'm believing in you!]

1116
00:59:05,370 --> 00:59:07,660
[Did he block it?]

1117
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:14,700
[Song Ji Hyo makes a goal!]

1118
00:59:16,330 --> 00:59:19,150
- You could have just blocked one!
[A dramatic tie]

1119
00:59:19,190 --> 00:59:20,910
[Breakdown]

1120
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,100
[The home team who won all the games lost because of Chun Hee]

1121
00:59:23,100 --> 00:59:24,700
- That's great.
- No way.

1122
00:59:24,700 --> 00:59:26,900
Bravo.

1123
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:28,800
- Since we have a tie
[The revival of the away team]

1124
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:31,900
Both teams will be kicking five balls.
[Both teams kick 5 balls and whoever gets the most balls in wins]

1125
00:59:31,940 --> 00:59:33,530
You just have to kick it.

1126
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:37,900
- See how many goes inside.
- If it comes out then it doesn't count. Right?

1127
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:40,840
- It just has to stay inside.
- It just has to stay inside?
-Of course.

1128
00:59:40,870 --> 00:59:43,860
- For example
- Why are you saying an example?

1129
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:50,600
- Let's quickly get this started.
[Embarrassed]

1130
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:53,690
- It's so hot.
- Show it by lifting it up.

1131
00:59:53,710 --> 00:59:55,190
Lift it up. Ok?
[As expected from the king of adlib]

1132
00:59:55,240 --> 00:59:57,760
- Okay? Lift it up.
- We got it.

1133
00:59:58,200 --> 01:00:00,100
[Hyung, I respect you]

1134
01:00:00,140 --> 01:00:02,180
- HaHa and Joong Ki.
- Joong Ki?

1135
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:05,100
- Just once.
- Yes, just once.
-Why do I feel like we'll lose?

1136
01:00:05,100 --> 01:00:07,800
He's at least a thousand times better than HaHa.

1137
01:00:07,900 --> 01:00:10,300
- Seriously.
- Hyung!

1138
01:00:10,300 --> 01:00:12,700
So is Jong Shin hyung a point?

1139
01:00:12,700 --> 01:00:14,840
- Am I a point?
[In banmal: A point?]

1140
01:00:16,500 --> 01:00:19,600
You guys look very close.

1141
01:00:19,700 --> 01:00:23,100
You guys are fighting so you guys must be really close.

1142
01:00:23,100 --> 01:00:25,600
- Can I be on friendly terms with you too?
- Let's get on with it!

1143
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:27,800
- Let's get on with it!
- Come out secretly.

1144
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:31,000
Hurry and go.

1145
01:00:32,030 --> 01:00:35,110
It's important if it goes inside or not.

1146
01:00:35,630 --> 01:00:36,980
Hey!

1147
01:00:38,340 --> 01:00:42,200
Control! Control the balls that are going inside!

1148
01:00:43,700 --> 01:00:45,700
[I will block them all!]

1149
01:00:47,700 --> 01:00:50,400
[Out of the 5 balls, how many will go inside?]

1150
01:00:56,200 --> 01:00:57,600
- That's it!
[Oh...?]

1151
01:00:58,470 --> 01:01:01,120
[Away team gets 4 balls in]

1152
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:03,700
- That's it!
[They all almost hit the bulls eye underneath his legs]

1153
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,400
[It looks like the Away team will win!]

1154
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:09,960
- Joong Ki.
[Mom's friend's son: Joong Ki's humiliation]

1155
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:12,410
Comparing you to HaHa makes you sad, right?

1156
01:01:12,700 --> 01:01:16,400
Start from here and kick like this. Practice.

1157
01:01:16,420 --> 01:01:19,760
- No, we're good. We can do this.
- Try this.

1158
01:01:19,810 --> 01:01:22,900
Try this. Practice.

1159
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:25,350
- Just go forward!
[It's high]

1160
01:01:25,390 --> 01:01:28,450
Don't worry about HaHa. Just think about it as vacant!

1161
01:01:29,100 --> 01:01:32,100
[It is very much vacant...]

1162
01:01:32,100 --> 01:01:35,470
Look there's no one there.

1163
01:01:35,900 --> 01:01:39,400
- HaHa is right there!
[Where did you go...]

1164
01:01:39,900 --> 01:01:41,600
Don't you see him?

1165
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:43,700
HaHa, raise your hands!

1166
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:46,500
- He's right here!
- It seems as if no one is there.

1167
01:01:46,600 --> 01:01:49,300
He's in there right now.

1168
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:52,600
- Is it capable of CG?
- Get it in.

1169
01:01:52,600 --> 01:01:54,600
- 1,2
- Slowly.

1170
01:01:54,700 --> 01:01:56,890
3!

[Joong Ki shoots a step late]
