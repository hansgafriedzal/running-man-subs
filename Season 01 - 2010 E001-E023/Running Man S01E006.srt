00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:52,300
Mother, Hambaya~ Hambaya~

177
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,100
Are you the runningman, mother?

178
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:56,900
You are not?

179
00:09:56,900 --> 00:10:00,700
[it's even hard to move in this situation] -Ah, I am looking for the runningman right now, mother!

180
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,500
Ah, hello!!

181
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:06,910
[But...]

182
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,400
[The one person who is moving around so freely during this time...]

183
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:14,100
[No body has realized who he is...]

184
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,600
[Myself, alone...]

185
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:23,300
[While it seems crazy around the others...]

186
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:26,000
I alone am free

187
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:29,200
Who am I? Where is this?

188
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:35,900
The only person who recognizes Kang Gary who lives in Jamshil

189
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:38,800
is light of the Seoul Tower

190
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:41,310
Hambaya~~ Hambaya~~~ [They are still searching for runningman]

191
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:43,050
Are you the runningman?

192
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,700
Running man?

193
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,300
[Frustrated]

194
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:51,100
[Is it this person who is wearing sneakers?]

195

00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:57,240
is the running man not here?

198
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,200
Please spread your light over here, just towards their feet!

199
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,000
He's wearing tennis shoes is their only hint!

200
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,600
They are focused and searching, but...

201
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,600
Still, there is one person who is so relaxed amongst the citizens

202
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:16,000
First, we need to find people who are avoiding us or aren't greeting us. [Brain Joongki and Muscle Jongkook's Tracking Point]

203
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,200

206
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:27,400
Then!!! One person who is trying to avoid them while passing by.

207
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,400
[Now run!]

208
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:32,900
Excuse me, hold on a second please.

209
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:37,200
Start. Hambaya~ Hambaya~ are you the running man?

210
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,120
Are you the running man?

211
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:42,500
[What will the conclusion be?]

212
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,400
Yes I am!

213
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,700

214
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:52,000

Where? Where?

218
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:03,200
Elated vs. Defeated

219
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,710
What will we do?!

220
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:08,400
[Regret...]

221
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,400
I told you we needed to find it fast!

222
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:13,400
They said they found it already!

223
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:18,600
[The first reveal of the runningball~!]

224

[Collect the Running Balls that are won after every mission in order to escape]

229

[What is the escape secret that the Running Balls are hiding?].

230
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,200
[Entering like a general back from a battle.]

231

[Jaesuk is again suddenly at Gary's side]

232
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:02,000
-Ahhh! Why are you doin this?

233
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,200
My colleague has found it, so I'm just celebrating as well

234
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:09,520
Please let me know before hand please!

235

They found something great.

236
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:13,690
It's the runningman ball.

237
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,700
[Soin team has got 1 Runningball]

238
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:18,400
Is there something inside? -I don't know. -Try opening it.

239
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,720
What's wrong?

240
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,500
-Oh, this is pretty heavy.

241
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,300
[Inside there is a ball that is the same color as the winning team]

242
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:25,200
Is it cream?

243
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:28,710
Is it cream? - No, it's a ball!

244
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:32,090
-I think it's our team's ball. [If you succeed at the mission, you will be given a ball of your team's color

245

Everyone, before you complete all of the missions you are not allowed to leave this place.

253
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:05,930
[Even if possible, you can not black Miss Yuna. Careful careful.]

254
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:09,370

[Why did the figure queen only cheer for YJS?!]

259
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:26,000
I personally know her~

260
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,400
She did a commercial with me twice.

261
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,900
yes? -I'm jealous~

262
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,400
I'm jealous~

263
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:38,530
We are all running hard, but why did she say that only to you? -Yes, we all are! But

264
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:42,070
she is just saying that she has great expectations for me today. So I need to win!

265
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:46,110
[Exactly what are you trying to say?]

266
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,400
I saw the punishment a little bit earlier today. Did you see it?

no showering,

271

in your sweat just as you are

272
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:02,490
you need to take public transportation for your ride home

273
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:05,230
but my house... is in Anyang...

274
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,600
How many times do you need to change buses from Namsan to Anyang?!

275
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:12,900
I definitely have to win today!!

276
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,800
Where is your house Kwangsoo?

277
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,690
I'm in NamYangJoo...

278
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,000
[A distance that is not too far from Anyang!]

279
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,500
We can just go like this... Also let's also add another things on the line.

280
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:26,360
Let's paint on each other's faces.

281
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:27,820
Sounds good!

282
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:30,490
Just a litte

283
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:33,010

-Are you really a celebrity/

[which team will be the one who has to do the punishment tomorrow morning?]

290
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,900
Anywho, everyone has agreed to the punishment right?

291
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:58,540
Let's say next week that our team loses. Then I'm going to go to your team Jongkook.

292
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:00,560
I have a punishment I want to give to you.

293

Biceps 28

294
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:11,600
This?!

295
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:16,900
[Totally suits him]

While wearing that costume

297
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:21,110
Oh really?! Then me too I have one for you.

298
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:22,860
What? -I'm going to think of one and come.

299
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:25,400
I'm just saying that if we do win...

300
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:28,500
[worried] I really do want to lose once to see that.

301
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:31,510
No, we need to win!

302
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:33,590
There's the next one. Terminator

303
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:34,870
when he's kneeling

[Terminator's final pose[

...

308
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,630
I have so many ideas!

309
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,670

310
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:56,500
in that pose!

311
00:16:57,910 --> 00:17:00,000
you...

Can tower race! -Alright then.

315

[they are rearing togo]

317
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:20,500
since the punishment is fresh in our minds we have a lot of strength.

318
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:23,020
Let me explain the game quickly

319
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:26,010
today, we are at the Seoul Tower

320
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:29,040
since it's very tall

321
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:33,810
We need to put those cans on your feet

322
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:40,040
and you need to cross these barriers, pick up the Seoul Tower and then return

323
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,510
Kwansoo vs. Haha

324
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,400
It's okay~ Have a go! [Shortest vs. Tallest]

325
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,400
[After he gets on top of the cans, their heights are similar]

00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:52,200
It's similar!

327
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,300
-you are still not taller than him!

328
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,300
[First they have to secure the can to their shoes]

329
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:00,400
Make it tight, tight!

330
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,200
Yes will do!

331
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:06,200

[Kwangsoo, can he do it?]

347
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:59,500
[No matter what he does, he can't reach it]

[He always is energetic, but

352
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:20,300
because of his height he will lose some battles]

353

[Today he's facing the tallest kwangsoo]

354
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:29,600
[His arms and legs won't keep up with his own mind]

[It is his underwear?!]

369
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:30,000
His pants all came off!

370
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,800
Heyyy what are you doing??

371
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,200
All of a sudden it makes one awake!

372
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,600
Why are you enjoying this so much?

373
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:42,900
Shinyoung's sleep all flew away!

374
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,800
[Can't breathe]

375
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:47,150
His panties are showing, so you should have turned your head away!

376
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:48,900
Ahhh his panty!

377
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:50,470
What is this?

378
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:54,010
His but is like a peach! It just came out.

[embarrassed]

380

382

Oops, you're not on our team!

383
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,200
I'm not just a guy who is hosting the games!

384
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:09,900
hehe, I thought we were on the same side for a sec

385
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:15,100
The back must be stable.<br>[The two teams are getting ready]

I quit!<br>[I had it!]

391

[I won't stop until I get caught~]

393
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:49,220
-Joong Ki<br>-Yeah?<br>-Don't be so good to me.

394
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,800
Do you want to make flowers bloom?<br>[Joong Ki, is the only one who treats Shin Young well.]

395
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:56,300
Joong Ki, you have to be responsible until the very end.

396
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:59,630
- Actually, I am your fan, Noona. <br> - Oh, really?

397
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:03,300
What are you doing? <br>[Why Jae Suk kneels in front of Shin Young?!]

398
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:06,670
Confession?!

399
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:10,210
-It's a misunderstanding, a misunderstanding.<br>-Even though we are not on the same team, you have to treat the other team well too.

<i>Take it slow! Take it slow!</i><br>[Dam Bi already reached the turning point.]

411

What are you doing? <br>[Shin Young suddenly going toward Dam Bi?!]

412
00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:57,630
You're doing it on purpose!

413
00:22:57,690 --> 00:23:00,000

Dam Bi, don't give up! Don't give up!<br>[Does Shin Young thought Dam Bi's arm is her midnight feast?!]

421
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:31,700

You are tired? <br>[Your face looks very pale.]

515
00:29:08,050 --> 00:29:10,900
But-<br>-You also look tired.

516
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:12,860
Compared to them, we look really tired.

517
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:16,080
Why that? <br>[Instructions have arrive]

518
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,890
It's here?

519
00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:21,090
[If you rip off two name tags from the opposing team, you will gain two hints!]

520
00:29:21,090 --> 00:29:22,740
Two? From anyone?

521
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:24,420
[Hello! This is SBS Running Man! Once you rip the name tags of two people from the opposing team, there will be a hint there.]

522
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:27,180
Just any random two person? <br>[Any two member's name tags?]

523
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:28,970
You don't who it is? <br>[We don't know which two it is.]

524
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:30,830
[By ripping off two name tags from the opposing team, a hint about where the running balls are hidden will be given]

525
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:34,520
<i> This location is where the opposing team has to go to. </i>

526
00:29:40,090 --> 00:29:42,680
So they're going to have to look at this.

527
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:45,270
They're going to have to see it and we're going to hide it on our backs.

528
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:46,700
Whose back should we put it on?

529
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:49,190
[Both teams don't know which members of the opposing team have the hints.]

530
00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:53,060
We're here, we are finally here. Don't feel burdened hyung.

531
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:54,150
[Soin's team receives a message]

532
00:29:54,150 --> 00:29:55,840
This is Running Man.

533
00:29:58,490 --> 00:30:00,280
We have to choose two people.

534
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:02,770
We have to choose?

535
00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:06,730
It's better for Joong Ki and I to run around so you and Shin Young can hide.

536
00:30:06,730 --> 00:30:10,030
They might not think that we would put it on Shin Young's back.

537
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:12,460
And for you, I'll protect you.

538
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:14,150
I understand.

539
00:30:14,150 --> 00:30:16,430
The two of your work together.

540
00:30:16,430 --> 00:30:21,270
This is like a drama where you say something like "hyung you go first"

541
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,060
It'll be like a drama.

542
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:28,440
Touch Hyung's name tag... Like Hyung, go first! Like that.

543
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,610
Let'd do that next time.

544
00:30:29,610 --> 00:30:32,240
-Next time? <br> -Next time.

545
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:35,830
I think the other team will have Seven hide the hint

546
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:37,940
because he is fast.

547
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:40,960
From what I think, it's going to be on Seven and Kwangsoo.

548
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:45,600
Then...Lets put this on Dam Bi and go with her.

549
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:50,150
They won't think that we would have put it on Dam Bi.

550
00:30:50,150 --> 00:30:53,520
I will put this one on me.

551
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:59,610
Let's have a team that hides and another team that searches.

552
00:30:59,610 --> 00:31:02,670
I will hide with Kwangsoo.

553
00:31:02,670 --> 00:31:06,770
They will not think that Dam Bi will have the hint.

554
00:31:06,770 --> 00:31:09,910
- Let's do this well. We have to win. <br> - Ah~ What should we do~

555
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:14,200
-You seem to like these kind of things.<br>-It's fun~

556
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,100
One, two, three, fighting!

557
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:18,650
[Let's go home comfortably, Fighting!!]

558
00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:21,450
[There is a number on T2 Love's Tile.]

559
00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:24,110
There's a T2 Love's Tile.<br> That's right.

560
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:27,540
-There's a phone number.<br>-Wow, our team is so smart!

561
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:30,430
[Shin Young's hint: there is a number]

562
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:40,030
[Catch the other team and get the hint]

563
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:41,650
[Race start!]

564
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:48,440
- Doesn't this seem like we're filming a spy movie? <br> - It's been a long time since I've filmed a survival clip.

565
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:50,860
This is real.

566
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:54,270
This is real at 3am.

567
00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:58,320
They're going up there right now.

568
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,050
[Soin team. Joong Ki, Gary, and Shin Young]

569
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:08,790
[In order to hide]

570
00:32:08,790 --> 00:32:11,550
[Daein team moves to the 2nd floor cafe]

571
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:15,070
[Soin team follows right after them]

572
00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:21,360
[In a rushed mind, they head over to the women's restroom]

573
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:25,290
I found them!

574
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:29,730
Come here.

575
00:32:29,730 --> 00:32:32,820
Oh!<br>What? What?

576
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:36,500
[They don't know who has the hint among themselves...]

577
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:38,500
Hey Seven.

578
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:41,470
Son Dam Bi has the hint!

579
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:48,520
Where are you Seven?

580
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:49,780
You're dead!

581
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:54,590
[A mess]

582
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:56,490
[Seven comes to support!] <br> -Ah! There's a fire! A fire!

583
00:32:57,770 --> 00:33:00,580
[If Dambi gets out, the hint is taken away]

584
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:05,510
[Dambi gives her name tag to Suk Jin]

585
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:09,600
[Suk Jin runs away after taking Dambi's name tag]

586
00:33:13,650 --> 00:33:15,970
Should I turn mine off?<br>[Meanwhile, Daein team Jaesuk and Kwangsoo is...]

587
00:33:17,130 --> 00:33:19,060
Turn one off, turn one off.

588
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:20,920
[They first go towards the elevator]

589
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:23,530
The observatory! The observatory!

590
00:33:23,530 --> 00:33:26,820
If we get there, we'll be sure to win.

591
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:30,690
[Jae Suk and Kwang Soo are going to the observatory]

592
00:33:30,690 --> 00:33:34,630
- I'm so nervous now that I have to hide. <br> - I watched the last episode and you were pretty good at hiding though.

593
00:33:34,630 --> 00:33:37,450
When I played hide and go seek when I was little,

594
00:33:37,450 --> 00:33:41,420
I continued to hide even though everyone was found.

595
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:46,540
You can say that I was like a "spier" (spy + er).

596
00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:51,680
[They arrive at the top of the building]

597
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:57,570
Wow...it's so pretty.

598
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:04,310
It's so pretty.

599
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:07,790
[Seoul's view is like a painting]

600
00:34:07,790 --> 00:34:11,780
It's so beautiful, really. But if we really hide here, the game's over.

601
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:14,980
Kwang Soo, there's nowhere to hide.

602
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:17,140
This place won't do it.

603
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:20,990
- But if you go down and bump into them, we're over. <br> - It's really dangerous here.

604
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:28,330
Just in case we bump into them, don't run immediately.

605
00:34:28,330 --> 00:34:33,040
Because we're the aggressive type, if I run, they're going to follow us.

606
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:35,980
As long as it's not Jong Kook, do that.

607
00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:37,980
[But surprisingly...]

608
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:42,550
[Jong Kook and Jae Suk passed each other]

[They find a photo booth to hide in]

611
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:01,930
Lets stay here for the time being.

612
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:06,940
If you think someone is coming,

613
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:10,480
When there's a feeling of someone coming, go ahead and run away.

614
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,290
I got it hyung.

615
00:35:12,290 --> 00:35:15,550
-Ah, so they'll think I'm hiding here alone and run after me.<br>-That's right.

616
00:35:19,990 --> 00:35:22,210
It's quiet outside.

617
00:35:23,370 --> 00:35:24,980
[They are more anxious because it is so quiet]

618
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:26,880
[It's more unsettling now that it's quiet...] <b> - Suk Jin Hyung.</b>

619
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:36,250
Kwang Soo, if we're both here it's strange so...

620
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:39,800
Do you want to go up and look? Contact me too.

621
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:42,760
-What about hyung? <br>-I'll hide here for now.

622
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:45,800
Ok, I got it... but... ok.

623
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:48,170
What?

624
00:35:48,170 --> 00:35:51,680
Hyung, to be honest,

625
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:55,120
I thought that you were a true spy,

626
00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:59,370
but you kind of seem a little cowardly.

627
00:35:59,370 --> 00:36:01,680
It's not that.

628
00:36:02,510 --> 00:36:04,320
[Still, in the end]

629
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,390
[To not look cowardly, they both head outside]

630
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:08,120
That surprised me.

01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:35,620
Go, go do it!

1025
01:03:36,450 --> 01:03:40,440
- Seven, hit it hard. <br> - It's 1 vs 0, right?

1026
01:03:40,440 --> 01:03:42,870
Start

1027
01:03:42,870 --> 01:03:43,900
Okay

1028
01:03:43,900 --> 01:03:44,950
That's right!

1029
01:03:44,950 --> 01:03:47,840
Out!

1030
01:03:47,840 --> 01:03:50,690
[DaeIn team hit it back but it went out of bounds]

1031
01:03:50,690 --> 01:03:52,150
It's only 1 vs 1, you don't have to do this.

1032
01:03:52,150 --> 01:03:53,110
What is that?

1033
01:03:59,350 --> 01:04:01,010
How can badminton be this intense?

1034
01:04:01,010 --> 01:04:04,990
Oy, to the healthy one over there!

1035
01:04:04,990 --> 01:04:06,110
What?

1036
01:04:08,940 --> 01:04:10,220
<i> Let's just start! </i>

1037
01:04:13,250 --> 01:04:15,050
[Regardless, no one wants the punishment!]

1038
01:04:15,050 --> 01:04:18,870
We can win this. <br>[Currently at 1:1 tie]

1039
01:04:20,080 --> 01:04:24,980
That's it!<br>[The shuttlecock is barely in play...And again Gary goes...!]

1040
01:04:25,660 --> 01:04:27,630
[Daein barely returned it?]

1041
01:04:29,660 --> 01:04:31,630
[Far away~ ]

1042
01:04:32,290 --> 01:04:34,160
[Out]

1043
01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:36,530
[Up to 5 points - Daein 1: SoIn 2. A twist!]

1044
01:04:36,530 --> 01:04:40,160
[Ignore]

1045
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:41,630
[Dang it.]

1046
01:04:44,050 --> 01:04:46,640
Let's go get the shuttlecock.<br>What Dambi, come at me!

1047
01:04:46,640 --> 01:04:48,220
You can't hit me?<br>[Well yes, as our hands are tied]

1048
01:04:48,220 --> 01:04:49,680
Here, do it, do it.

1049
01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:53,290
[Threatening]<br>I could absolutely bite someone right now.

1050
01:04:53,290 --> 01:04:56,000
[Stepping back]<br>Don't make me untie these wrists!

1051
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:57,720
[Horror] <br>Anything but that...<br>I'll untie it, I swear!

1052
01:04:57,720 --> 01:04:59,740
[Tension]

1053
01:05:02,840 --> 01:05:04,570
[Out...?]

1054
01:05:05,390 --> 01:05:07,250
[IN! The score is counted!]

1055
01:05:07,250 --> 01:05:08,950
This isn't right!

1056
01:05:08,950 --> 01:05:12,520
This really isn't right!

1057
01:05:14,600 --> 01:05:16,700
That's just luck!

1058
01:05:16,700 --> 01:05:19,300
Oh... Hey!

1059
01:05:19,300 --> 01:05:20,600
[Surprised]

1060
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:28,530
What should we do?!

1061
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:35,100
Fighting!

1062
01:05:36,700 --> 01:05:39,200
Good!

1063
01:05:40,100 --> 01:05:41,400
Good!

1064
01:05:43,020 --> 01:05:45,800
Where do you think you're hitting?

1065
01:05:49,660 --> 01:05:52,450
I can't do this~

1066
01:05:59,870 --> 01:06:03,650
It's not what you think!

1067
01:06:03,670 --> 01:06:05,280
It's not like that.

1068
01:06:05,330 --> 01:06:07,710
I'm sad!<br>I'm sorry, it's not like that.

1069
01:06:07,740 --> 01:06:09,970
[Again]

1070
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:14,300
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, but you got hit near your neck.

1071
01:06:14,340 --> 01:06:17,260
What?!

1072
01:06:17,290 --> 01:06:19,600
Do I need to show you exactly where you hit me with my hands?

1073
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:22,400
You got hit at your stomach.

1074
01:06:31,780 --> 01:06:34,890
Ah I'm going crazy.

1075
01:06:34,910 --> 01:06:37,700
Do you want to try getting hit too?

1076
01:06:42,500 --> 01:06:45,700
We're serving.

1077
01:06:47,900 --> 01:06:50,500
That friend, sigh!

1078
01:06:57,200 --> 01:07:00,100
This is the last.<br>Let's have fun!<br>If we win it's over right?

1079
01:07:00,100 --> 01:07:02,600
If we win it's over.<br>I will serve.

1080
01:07:02,630 --> 01:07:04,760
I'm serving.

1081
01:07:05,300 --> 01:07:11,400
[After hitting the net, it goes over!]

1082
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,100
[YEAH!]

1083
01:07:25,400 --> 01:07:28,300
If this hits over we win. <br> We really have to win.

1084
01:07:33,500 --> 01:07:36,200
[They are talking but...]

1085
01:07:37,400 --> 01:07:40,000
[The ball that barely crossed the net]

1086
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:41,550
[WOW!]

1087
01:09:41,140 --> 01:09:42,530
<i>[SoIn's team gets caught in the net; FAIL]</i>

1088
01:09:42,530 --> 01:09:46,620
It got caught, yes! <br>Match point!

1089
01:09:46,620 --> 01:09:51,710
<i>[Will SoIn fall apart like this?]</i>

1090
01:09:52,570 --> 01:09:56,570
Is this the end? If we end it here, it's really over.<br><i>If they gain one more point, they can escape!</i>

1091
01:10:00,670 --> 01:10:03,750
<i>[It's not over yet!]</i>

1092
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:08,090
<i>[You could say their fates are tied to this last round...]</i>

1093
01:10:13,380 --> 01:10:18,510
Time! Just a moment.<br><i>[Everyone holding their breath from nervousness]</i>

1094
01:10:28,460 --> 01:10:29,820
They need to give us one point.

1095
01:10:41,020 --> 01:10:42,790
<i>[Chaos]</i>

1096
01:10:42,790 --> 01:10:44,660
<i>[Flying high!]</i>

1097
01:10:44,660 --> 01:10:46,350
<i>[We have to receive it!]</i>

1098
01:10:46,350 --> 01:10:47,530
<i>[Please miss!]</i>

1099
01:10:50,980 --> 01:10:53,350
<i>[It's still in play!]</i>

1100
01:10:59,400 --> 01:11:00,900
<i>[Please!]</i>

1101
01:11:06,240 --> 01:11:07,840
<i>[They missed!]</i>

1102
01:11:42,520 --> 01:11:46,120
But we won't. So can't we just leave?

1103
01:11:46,120 --> 01:11:48,490
Why? What?

1104
01:11:48,490 --> 01:11:50,990
I know! I know!

1105
01:12:03,300 --> 01:12:05,560
That will mean we win?

1106
01:12:23,650 --> 01:12:29,310
They're going to edit out everything except the hilarious bits anyways!

1107
01:12:36,620 --> 01:12:43,340
Put it in already, as quick as you can<br>-Lets just try it.

1108
01:12:46,490 --> 01:12:49,890
This is driving me crazy...just toss them in

1109
01:12:49,890 --> 01:12:54,230
Please please please!<br><i>[DaeIn has 3 balls, SoIn has 2 balls in the lottery]</i>

1110

-Please let us go just this once!<br><i>[Both teams are desperate]</i>

1112

01:14:06,080 --> 01:14:08,590
<i>[The first one is a fail!]</i>

[Finally the bus leaves]

1126
01:15:49,850 --> 01:15:54,400
Wow...seriously...<br>[There aren't really any words...]

- Why are you all yawning so much?

1129
01:16:07,100 --> 01:16:09,550
They're getting on, more people are getting on.

1130
01:16:12,950 --> 01:16:15,030
Hi~!<br>[They still warmly greet them]

1131
01:16:16,030 --> 01:16:19,260
We didn't startle you too much, did we?<br>[...?]

1132
01:16:19,260 --> 01:16:21,880
I think they'd be pretty shocked.<br>[Are they really celebrities? (Whisper)]

1133

[(Again) Are they really celebrities?]

1134
01:16:24,850 --> 01:16:29,350
You really think celebrities would walk around like this?

[It's Son Dambi!]<br>[Where?!]

1136
01:16:39,790 --> 01:16:44,490
Please take a seat here<br>[Trying to give up their seats for other passengers.]

Please be happy!

Yoo Jaesuk, you're so cool!

1141
