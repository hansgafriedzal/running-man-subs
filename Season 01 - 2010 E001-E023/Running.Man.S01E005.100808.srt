She said "That's not it!"

462

00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:34,200
-Oh! It's there? <br> It's here! It's here! Look!

517
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,200
[Even though they don't know why, A380 is the second floor! Go Go!]

518
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,500
<i>They are following us.</i>

519
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:47,100
They already went up to the second floor!

520
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:54,400
[Taller Team is one step ahead and arrives at the 2nd floor exhibit]<br> Hyung, "Advanced Science" has an "A".

521
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:03,900
[The country's achievements in astronomy, aerospace, science and technology can be seen all in a glance here at the museum]

522
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,800
[Is this where A380 is?]

523
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:12,100
-A380? <br> -Yes, it's 380.

524
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:14,550
[Everyone looks for A380 in the exhibit]

525
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:19,700
[Is it here?]

526
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,400
[At a loss.]

527
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:30,600
Look at the second floor.

528
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:35,300
[The golden pig is sitting near them!!]

529
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:36,900
It's here, here!

530
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:38,990
[Kyaaaak~]

531
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,400
[They thought they were going to get the pig, but an astronaut suddenly approaches!]

532
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:44,070
What is this?

533
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:46,800
[Entrance blocked]

534
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:49,300
[The mysterious astronauts surround Jihyo!]

535
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,200
[For now, she passes the golden pig to Suk Jin]

536
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,100
[Huh? Something's off?]

537
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:56,600
There's nothing in here! <br> [It's a fake empty golden pig]

538
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:00,300
[Jihyo is locked into the mysterious chair!]

539
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:04,500
[If you find a fake golden pig, you get a punishment!]

540
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:06,600
Mommy! <br> [Spin!]

541
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:08,750
Mommy!

542
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:13,100
[Game where if you sit in the revolving seat, you will become familiar with the loss of balance in space.]

543
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,200
[But to her, it is only a punishment...]

544
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,500
[Top speed.]

545
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,600
[Ah... today is seriously...]

546
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:30,500
[I had to deal with Sukjin's annoyances...]

547
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:37,000
[I had to fight with Jongkook...]

548
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:44,800
[I had absolutely no luck today...]

549
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:49,900
[Now...I have to deal with a punishment]

550
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:52,700
You look like you're going to be possessed by the Gumiho

551
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:55,100
[Nine-tailed fox with one shoe?]

552
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,200
What are you doing?

553
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,800
Jihyo!

554
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:04,600
[The gyroscope punishment ends!] <br> She lost her mind.

555
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,100
[Dizzy, dizzy]

556
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:09,170
Ah, I'm getting motion sickness.

557
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,900
Jihyo, what are you doing?

558
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:16,200
I got caught while looking for the golden pig.

559
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,500
[What an eventful day for Jihyo]

560
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:23,000
[Answer reveal: What is A380?]

561
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:27,700
[Within the Science Museum, the cutting edge technology of flight space on the 2nd floor.]

562
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:30,700
[The very large aircraft, Airbus A380]

563
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,900
[The place where the golden pig is hidden is...]

564
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:40,300
[right above the seats and inside the cabinet!]

565
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:45,600
[Oh?! Jaesuk found the right place]

566
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,760
The airbus 380 is here.

567
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,500
[He checks the cockpit]

568
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:59,200
[As expected, detective Joongki finds A380!]

569
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:02,830
Walkie-talkie! Walkie-talkie!

570
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:06,500
[He needs to let his team know, but he doesn't have any walkie-talkies...]

571
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:13,100
[On the other hand, Jaesuk just needs to turn his head..!]

572
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,500
[It's right there]

573
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:23,900
[Ah... he just passes by it...]

574
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:25,700
[What a waste...]

575
00:29:26,410 --> 00:29:28,210
We have to find it.

576
00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:31,500
This place is so large that I can't figure out where it is.

577
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:38,300
Oh, ooh.

578
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:41,500
[Jaesuk was searching well for a while, but gets distracted]

579
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:49,100
It says A380 on the outside of the airplane.

580
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,500
[The Taller Team enters A380]

581
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,500
Open stuff like the cabinets.

582
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:07,100
[Jaesuk... is now openly playing]

583
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:10,700
[The Taller team checks the seat cabinets!]

584
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,900
[Here it is!]

585
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:17,500
[This is the real golden pig!]

586
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:22,800
[The Taller Team finds 1 golden pig!]

587
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,500
[Though they were wrong about the meaning of 'A', they are the first to find the piggy bank]

588
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:36,000
[On the other side...this person is still in childlike state.]

589
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,700
[And the little brother who imitates him]

590
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,800
But we haven't found them all. There is one left.

591
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,200
We found both of them.

592
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:46,700
One was an empty piggy bank...

593
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:49,400
That means that there another one!

594
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:56,700
[We will reveal where the other golden pig is located]

595
00:30:57,500 --> 00:31:00,800
[An impossible-to-find golden pig, no matter how hard the Running Man members try]

596
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,400
[That secret is right here...]

597
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:07,100
[1 hour ago...]

598
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:10,800
[A walking astronaut mannequin?!]

599
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,400
[A staff member puts the golden pig in the helmet he is holding]

600
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,600
[Struggle, Struggle] <br> [Please close the door for me~]

601
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:19,900
<i>They are coming in, move!</i>

602
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:24,300
[The staff withdraw quickly after the members arrive earlier than expected]

603
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:27,500
<i> They're here!</i>

604
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:30,100
[Car's selection Team So In arrives.!]

605
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,600
[Super nervous]

606
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,700
[She doesn't suspect anything!]

607
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:46,600
[Jihyo... simply passes by]

608
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:51,300
[Jaesuk!]

609
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:53,500
[Of course, passes]

610
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:58,500
[Even though many people pass...]

611
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:04,100
[right in front of him... They don't know!]

612
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,200
[No one has noticed yet.]

613
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:11,200
[20 minutes has passed and hasn't moved...!]

614
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,400
I feel like there should be one over there.

615
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,700
[9th level quick-witted Suk Jin is fooled...]

616
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,700
[Phew... Thank goodness]

617
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,590
[Looking, Looking]

618
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,700
[Emergency! Jong Kook approaching!]

619
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,500
[He's right in front of it!]

620
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:46,300
[Rigid.]

621
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,100
[Hmmm... something...]

622
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,300
<i>One more?</i>

623
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:56,300
[Jong Kook, keeps going around...]

624
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:06,500
[Ah! He bent down!]

625
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:11,900
[Will he see the golden pig in the hand?]

626
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:15,900
[Thump, Thump, Thump, Thump]

627
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:25,200
[Jongkook! Did he find out?!]

628
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:32,500
Surely it wouldn't be there.

629
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:34,400
[Surely, it wouldn't be there!]

630
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:38,100
[Jong Kook sees a display manequin.]

631
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:41,800
[10 years shaved off]

632
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:46,000
[He pushed the pig in more so it can't be seen]

633
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,700
[Phew... that could have been bad]

634
00:33:56,800 --> 00:34:00,200
Where could it be?

635
00:34:02,370 --> 00:34:05,750
Something is weird. This is...

636
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:09,000
[A suspicion that can't be explained.]

637
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,400
[Why did you come back?!]

638
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:23,100
Why does this open?

639
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,300
[The door opens?]

640
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:27,700
[As expected, something is off]

641
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:29,500
[Looks like Jong Kook can see something.]

642
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:31,000
[People have started to gather.]

643
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:45,600
Nice, nice, nice, nice!

644
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:48,100
[He puts his hand into the helmet]

645
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:50,800
[Will Jongkook take the golden pig this time too?]

646
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:01,800
[People leaving due to the human manequin defense.]

647
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,800
I think this is right! Keep going!

648
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:06,300
The helmet! Hyung, the helmet!

649
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:11,400

[If you lift it...]

[Suk Jin's surprising glorious...What?]

658
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,700

[Combat.]

664

[The owner of this golden pig is still undecided]

[Astronaut who overcame many critical situations.]

666
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:12,100
[Can he safely defend the golden pig again?]

667
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:21,800
[The golden pig is Jong Kook's!]

[The Taller Team succeeds in getting 2 golden pigs]

669
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,700
[Regretful~]

670
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,950
I found it first!

671
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,500

[A little later in the garden within the Science Museum...]

675
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:55,960
Okay, everyone. As you may already know,

676
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:59,720
It's a time where you go between reality and dreaming.

677
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:02,230
I know. You can't give us that long of a resting time.

678
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:03,750
-Yeah, yeah. <br>-We'll fall right asleep.

679
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:08,100
What's surprising is you think Jong Kook is a man of few words? He's not.

680

-Me?<br> -Yes, yes, yes

684
00:37:18,490 --> 00:37:22,950

685
00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:25,720
-Ah, stop it! I don't want to do stuff like that! <br> -Aw, please just do it once.

[What is this all of a sudden at dawn~<br>Caught at the time you are most sleepy...]

687

Why do I have to do this right now?

688
00:37:31,330 --> 00:37:33,100

689
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:39,100
-I always knew that Jong Kook was a good dancer but never this good. <br> -It's not that I'm good at dancing.

690
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:41,700

-When I was young, Mr. Yang was my hip-hop hero. <br> -Of course!

694
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:57,700
So when Mr. Yang came out on a program,

695
00:37:57,700 --> 00:38:00,800
he would often highlight Hip-hop. <br> -He would do that often in the past.

696
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:06,510
-And you know, the people on the program would ask "Oh, please teach us some Hip-hop." <br> -Yes, of course.

697
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:10,100
He would wear the hat very often.

698
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:14,800
He'd be like "Hip-hop isn't hard."

699

[How about Kwang Soo?]

710
00:39:04,930 --> 00:39:08,610
It's because it's the middle of the night and we have to stay awake.

711
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:13,200
The door is here and you have to pass it. How?

he used to be a member of H.O.T.

725
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:59,600
Why? What are you doing?

726
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:02,100
Seriously, he was supposed to be Kang Ta.

727

Gary, please show us some of your dancing.

730
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:17,000
My dance isn't technique based.

731
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,600
I don't need stuff like this.

732
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:22,600
-It's not technical, it's more based on movement. <br> -So, please show us this dance.

733
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:25,700
Seo Tae Ji and the children were popular for

It's funny!

751
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:28,600
In a club, you don't need to dance anything else.

752
00:41:28,630 --> 00:41:30,610
All you need to do is this, in front of the speaker.

Hey. Hey.

952
00:51:18,860 --> 00:51:20,110
They're planning something weird.

953
00:51:26,700 --> 00:51:28,500
It's the last person to leave right?

954
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:30,800
[Since the last person off the bus loses, it's every man for himself!]

955
00:51:31,500 --> 00:51:32,900
[On one side, there's Jae Suk and Gary]

956
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:36,900
[Jae Suk and Gary are tightly holding each other's clothes]

957

[What are you doing there, hyung-nim?]

00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:49,700
[Once again, it's Jae Suk, who won't let go, even in death]

[Attacking Suk Jin's weakness, his nose, again!]

978

[Huh?]

981
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,600
[I've well and truly caught Suk Jin!]

982
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:03,000
[Even looking like this, it feels good to have escaped the bus...]

983
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:06,700
[They can't move an inch]

984
00:53:11,300 --> 00:53:13,300

Seriously, you...! <br>[The second hyung scolds him in Suk Jin's stead]

1006

Don't you respect your hyungs?! <br>[Kwang Soo and Haha almost reach the exit]

1007
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,500
Don't you have any hyungs?!

1008
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,700
[The short hyung keeps yanking his hair today]

1009

Oppa, our team has to win.

1037
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:28,200
Did everyone leave?

1038
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,600
<i>Leave, leave!</i>

1039
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,400
<i>Leave, leave! </i><br>[Joong Ki plans a different way of escaping!]

1040
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:36,800
Hey Nichkun come help me.

1041
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:38,400
[Nichkun is able to help Suk Jin!]

1042
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:41,600
-What! <br>-Nichkhun!

1043
00:55:42,700 --> 00:55:45,000
[Situation where Jong Kook needs to escape fast!]

1044
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,600
<i>Don't block the way! Move, move, move! </i><br>[Nichkhun is moving to block Jong Kook!]

1045
00:55:53,700 --> 00:55:56,100
[Nichkhun, by a hair's breadth! He blocks Jong Kook with his left arm!]

1046
00:55:57,800 --> 00:56:00,200
[From here it's a battle of strength!!]

1047
00:56:02,300 --> 00:56:03,800
[I can't just stay still!]

1048
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:06,400
<i>Why are you taking off my shoe?</i>

1049
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:10,200
<i>Hyung, hurry up and come out.</i>

1050
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:12,000
[Jong Kook vs Nichkun]

1051
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:15,200

1052
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:16,600
Oppa, come out, come out!

1053
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:21,000
[Will it be Jong Kook first? Will it be Nichkun and Suk Jin first?]

1054
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:28,000
[Wow, Nichkhun. With just your left arm, Jong Kook was...!!]

1055
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:31,700
slip~

1056
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:33,900
<i>Hurry up and come out!</i>

1057
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:35,700
[Jong Kook and staff escape together!]

1058
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:40,600
Countless bare spots.

1059
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:41,810
<i>Hyung, are you okay?</i>

1060
00:56:41,850 --> 00:56:43,500
the unlucky(?) staff taht followed them also feels giddy

1061
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:46,100
Are you okay?

1062
00:56:49,900 --> 00:56:52,400
He's a monster. A monster.

1063
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:54,900
Team So In wins!

1064
00:56:54,900 --> 00:56:57,300
Wins! Received 50 thousand won prize money!

1065
00:56:58,700 --> 00:57:02,900
bearing in mind that the child team is quietly leading, all that is left to decide the winner is the golden pig!

1066
00:57:03,700 --> 00:57:06,800
Are you okay? You seem lost.

1067
00:57:06,810 --> 00:57:09,860
I am really sleepy.

1068
00:57:09,860 --> 00:57:11,600
Ji Hyo, this about this.

1069
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:14,000
If we lose we have to do the punishment and go home.

1070
00:57:14,300 --> 00:57:15,900
Suddenly it is a must to stay energetic!

1071
00:57:16,300 --> 00:57:20,300
How many golden pigs do they have?

1072
00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:21,670
It's here.

1073
00:57:22,410 --> 00:57:24,090
<i>Open the roof and two pigs.</i>

1074
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:26,300
Rooftop.

1075
00:57:27,190 --> 00:57:29,940
"Penetrate the roof" sounds like a hint~

1076
00:57:29,940 --> 00:57:31,500
Break the roof and two pigs.

1077
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:32,900
A place where you can see the sky.

1078
00:57:35,290 --> 00:57:37,450
The observatory.

1079
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:43,200
We have to find it.

1080
00:57:44,700 --> 00:57:47,000
Instructions came.

1081
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:48,600
This is a game with no end.

1082
00:57:49,290 --> 00:57:51,470
Break the roof and two pigs.

1083
00:57:51,470 --> 00:57:54,870
do we have to go to the roof quickly after receiving this order? <br> ~child team also started raking their brains...~

1084
00:57:54,950 --> 00:57:56,590
I don't think it's just a rooftop.

1085
00:57:56,590 --> 00:57:59,480
I think it can only be the rooftop.

1086
00:58:00,100 --> 00:58:02,100
If you break the roof it's the rooftop.

1087
00:58:02,100 --> 00:58:03,700
Let's go.

1088
00:58:03,700 --> 00:58:08,480
Let's think about it first.

1089
00:58:09,100 --> 00:58:11,700
Should we go out?

1090
00:58:11,700 --> 00:58:13,200
We really have to win.

1091
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:17,800
Roof?

1092
00:58:19,010 --> 00:58:20,820
Is it that?

1093
00:58:20,870 --> 00:58:22,500
Is it that?

1094
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:24,800
[Bingo! They found the observatory!]

1095
00:58:25,700 --> 00:58:27,130
Break the roof.

1096
00:58:27,150 --> 00:58:29,050
Break the roof. Break the roof.

1097
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:32,300
Hyung! Ah Ah!

1098
00:58:32,350 --> 00:58:34,210
We are at the Science Hall.

1099
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:38,610
There should be a place where we can see the sky. The roof would open there.

1100
00:58:38,650 --> 00:58:41,860
<i>-To see the stars.</i><br>-He is really smart.<br>-Really?

1101
00:58:41,930 --> 00:58:44,030
You are right again.

1102
00:58:44,060 --> 00:58:46,310
There is. I saw an observatory.

1103
00:58:46,330 --> 00:58:49,240
-Right? -Be quiet.

1104
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:52,700
Earlier outside I looked and looked.

1105
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:56,500
are we going to start running? <br> ~Moving towards the place of the observatory~

1106
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:59,900
Jessica has a pretty stride.

1107
00:59:02,470 --> 00:59:04,990
One step ahead of finding the observatory station.

1108
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:07,600
Its there! Its there!

1109
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:09,800
There it is.

1110
00:59:11,900 --> 00:59:13,900
Sprinting

1111
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:15,800
What is that?

1112
00:59:16,900 --> 00:59:20,800
<i>That's right I saw it. That's what I was talking about since the beginning.</i>

1113
00:59:20,910 --> 00:59:23,530
I saw it here.

1114
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:25,400
two teams sprint towards a common destination.

1115
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:27,900
Hyung, behind the building.

1116
00:59:28,190 --> 00:59:30,130
they are here too hurry up!

1117
00:59:30,170 --> 00:59:32,110
The kids are coming so hurry up.

1118
00:59:33,260 --> 00:59:35,280
We are one step behind.

1119

1120
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:44,970
I can't have poor stamina.

1121
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,800

1122
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:55,750

1125
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:05,200
So where are the golden pigs?

1126
01:00:05,210 --> 01:00:06,980
where?

1127
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:11,200
trying to beat the childs team...

1128
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:15,400
Blue team now enters the observatory.

1129
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:20,900
[Just then!]

1130
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:25,700

[Both teams see the golden pig!]

1133

On top of the roof. On top of the roof.

1141
01:00:58,700 --> 01:01:00,200

No way of getting to the golden pig.

01:05:58,600 --> 01:06:01,700
smart 40 year old, Sukjin tried to get rid of Haha by pretending not to see it.

1214
01:06:01,800 --> 01:06:03,300
[He's not leaving...?]

1215
01:06:05,940 --> 01:06:08,270
Hey! It's here!

1216
01:06:08,900 --> 01:06:10,800
Drags HaHa away!

1217
01:06:13,400 --> 01:06:15,800
[It's on that side!]

1218
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:20,000
To get the last Golden pig

1219
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,400
<i>It's in there.</i>

1220
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:24,300
Fierce Battle

1221
01:06:25,800 --> 01:06:28,000
Gary goes in for the pig..

1222
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,500
Who does the golden pig belong too?!

1223
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:37,700
[Ji Hyo got it!]

1224
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:41,400
[Team Dae-In acquires all 2 golden pigs]

1225
01:06:43,800 --> 01:06:45,500
SukJin and Jihyo combination success!

1226
01:06:45,500 --> 01:06:47,100
Race over!

1227
01:06:49,100 --> 01:06:51,300
after a long night

1228
01:06:51,300 --> 01:06:52,700
Sunrise greets the Science Museum

1229
01:06:52,720 --> 01:06:55,640
How many do we have?

1230
01:06:55,700 --> 01:06:57,810
We only have two.

1231
01:06:57,810 --> 01:07:02,470
If you have 500 won in there and we have 10 won then we can lose.

1232
01:07:02,510 --> 01:07:05,480
Right now, Ji Hyo

1233
01:07:05,800 --> 01:07:09,400
really wants to go home.

1234
01:07:10,150 --> 01:07:11,480
Can she escape today?

1235
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:16,100
It's already daytime

1236
01:07:19,480 --> 01:07:22,510
It's time to count the 500,000 won

1237
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:29,900
It's both 50 won and 10 won.

1238
01:07:30,300 --> 01:07:33,100
The feeling is good.

1239
01:07:33,900 --> 01:07:35,600
Why is there so many?

1240
01:07:37,600 --> 01:07:39,600
[The coins keep coming out.]

1241
01:07:47,100 --> 01:07:49,900
If we go over 34,000 won then we win.

1242
01:07:50,300 --> 01:07:53,000
Blue team needs more than 34000 won to win

1243
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,800
34,000 won is all we need.

1244
01:07:55,800 --> 01:07:59,640
If there is only 10 won coins in there then we win.

1245
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:01,100
Oh my..

1246
01:08:01,100 --> 01:08:03,860
Silver color is coming out.

1247
01:08:03,860 --> 01:08:05,570
Its all silver~

1248
01:08:05,620 --> 01:08:06,950
Let's start.

1249
01:08:06,950 --> 01:08:09,500
The results are hard to tell

1250
01:08:09,500 --> 01:08:11,300
100 won and 340 won are coming out.

1251
01:08:12,800 --> 01:08:14,300
[Please...]

1252
01:08:14,300 --> 01:08:16,300
of course

1253
01:08:20,500 --> 01:08:23,300
We went over.

1254
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:31,100
Blue team wins!

1255
01:08:31,400 --> 01:08:33,900
[Bitter]

1256
01:08:35,800 --> 01:08:38,200
Adult team has to stay for the punishment.

1257
01:08:40,600 --> 01:08:43,000
[Now time to leave!]

1258
01:08:43,900 --> 01:08:45,400
Its time for us to leave, yay

1259
01:08:46,200 --> 01:08:48,500
Thank you, Thank you for the hard work.

1260
01:08:48,500 --> 01:08:50,590
Kids team leaves after 18 hours in the museum

1261
01:08:54,900 --> 01:08:56,800
The world outside

1262
01:08:58,100 --> 01:09:00,900
FREEDOMMM

1263
01:09:00,900 --> 01:09:02,230
oppa, Look at the sunrise.

1264
01:09:02,240 --> 01:09:04,140
<i> 1, 2, 3...</i>

1265
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:10,900
Freedom!

1266
01:09:12,160 --> 01:09:16,320
Today, we have to clean.

1267
01:09:16,320 --> 01:09:19,380
~ empty. ~ <br> everything has to be clean before the museum opens.

1268
01:09:20,500 --> 01:09:22,200
[This large place...]

1269
01:09:25,700 --> 01:09:30,400
everyone is diligently cleaning their area

1270
01:09:34,200 --> 01:09:37,470
If you date a guy, you ignore him right?

1271
01:09:37,530 --> 01:09:40,490
I think you're right.

1272
01:09:40,500 --> 01:09:42,330
She does have charm.

1273
01:09:42,330 --> 01:09:44,750
Are you confessing your love?

1274
01:09:49,930 --> 01:09:52,790
Why are you cleaning like that?

1275
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:55,400
~sleepily cleaning~

1276
01:09:55,400 --> 01:09:57,200
<i>What is that?</i>

1277
01:09:59,680 --> 01:10:02,130
<i>Thats understandable.</i>

1278
01:10:02,180 --> 01:10:04,490
He is really tired.

1279
01:10:05,300 --> 01:10:08,600
Sukjin has fallen asleep but with a lurking Nickhun nearby.

1280
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:16,200
