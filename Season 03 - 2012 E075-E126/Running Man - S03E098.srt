[Let's see...]

669
00:40:39,195 --> 00:40:40,743
Show me, what is it?

670
00:40:42,019 --> 00:40:43,574
I already showed it to you...

671
00:40:43,575 --> 00:40:44,587
What are you looking at together?

672
00:40:44,588 --> 00:40:47,315
You weren't downstairs when
we were all searching earlier...!

673
00:40:47,316 --> 00:40:50,107
- What are you doing?
- Just go sit over there for now, Gary.

674
00:40:50,108 --> 00:40:51,851
I'll confirm first and tell you.

675
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:01,611
[The person who gets
their nametag torn off...]

676
00:41:01,612 --> 00:41:06,374
[You're saying they become
a zombie like me, right?]

677
00:41:07,903 --> 00:41:14,194
[Should I make a strong zombie colleague?]

678
00:41:15,768 --> 00:41:18,532
[What... What is this?]

679
00:41:22,007 --> 00:41:24,082
- Jong Kook, this was an excuse.
- What the heck?

680
00:41:24,083 --> 00:41:27,222
Jong Kook, I'm sorry!
[Huh? Ji Hyo... No way?!]

681
00:41:27,223 --> 00:41:29,915
[The Monday Couple that were
walking together a little earlier...]

682
00:41:29,916 --> 00:41:35,305
See the door's open?
It means someone's already been...

683
00:41:35,306 --> 00:41:36,672
I think someone's been in here.

684
00:41:36,673 --> 00:41:39,003
[As soon as she enters the room...]

685
00:41:40,568 --> 00:41:42,406
I'm a zombie right now.

686
00:41:44,288 --> 00:41:45,542
What did you say?

687
00:41:46,684 --> 00:41:49,704
- What did you say?
- I've always been a zombie.

688
00:41:49,705 --> 00:41:52,922
You've now been infected
with the zombie virus.

689
00:41:52,923 --> 00:41:54,668
I can't be bitten...

690
00:41:54,669 --> 00:41:58,630
[Just like this,
Ji Hyo's been a zombie since earlier...]

691
00:41:59,071 --> 00:42:01,287
[How can this be...?]
Jong Kook!

692
00:42:01,651 --> 00:42:03,294
He says I've been infected too!

693
00:42:03,295 --> 00:42:05,405
I'm sorry, but you've got to
live as a zombie now.

694
00:42:07,071 --> 00:42:11,607
[Only the head zombie Gary can tear off
the nametags.  Other zombies can lure humans.]

695
00:42:11,608 --> 00:42:16,562
Since you've made me a zombie...
[Mr. Capable now is also a zombie]

696
00:42:16,563 --> 00:42:18,958
I guess we can finish this within
30 minutes now.

697
00:42:18,959 --> 00:42:20,225
20 minutes.

698
00:42:20,226 --> 00:42:21,888
Let's go.

699

700
00:42:33,310 --> 00:42:35,485
<i>This is the only thing that keeps playing!</i>

701
00:42:37,104 --> 00:42:40,149
Suk Jin... Why...
Why does this thing keep playing?

702
00:42:40,590 --> 00:42:43,379
- Why is this thing always playing?
- I think there's something about that...

703
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:44,766
Don't you think so?

704
00:42:47,627 --> 00:42:49,775
- It keeps playing the same thing, right?
- The same thing.

705
00:42:55,702 --> 00:42:57,622
There's a TV in here too.

706
00:42:57,982 --> 00:43:00,124
I wonder if there's
something in 'You and I'...

707
00:43:00,471 --> 00:43:04,554
[It doesn't seem like it's on
for us to watch it...]

708
00:43:04,555 --> 00:43:06,605
- This is so hard...
- Seriously.

709
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:11,859
This is exhausting, exhausting.
[While exhausted, a brief time to rest]

710
00:43:14,457 --> 00:43:16,448
Just what is that about?

711
00:43:19,234 --> 00:43:20,966
Where are Kwang Soo and Suk Jin?

712
00:43:20,967 --> 00:43:24,010
[Mr. Capable zombie heading their way...]

713
00:43:25,326 --> 00:43:27,215

What's this?

715
00:43:32,311 --> 00:43:35,369
[Huh?  Breaking news?]

716
00:43:36,487 --> 00:43:37,784
What?

717

<i>The last sighting of the zombie
was at Incheon Nature Park today.</i>

720

<i>and until early tomorrow morning, no one will
be able to enter or leave the island.</i>

727

738

<i>There are 6 of these special water guns...</i>

740
00:44:49,712 --> 00:44:55,137
<i>They can only be obtained from the 6 countries
that have formulated these water guns.</i>

[In order to destroy the zombie,
they need a special water gun and the potion]

- No!!
- That's not us!

- No, it's not me.

been found in this room?

One of us is a zombie.

770

But...
That female student...

771
00:47:51,015 --> 00:47:53,430
She gave this to me saying that
I'm going to need it.

772
00:47:58,559 --> 00:48:03,695
- Because I like you so much...
- This is hairspray for your hair?

773
00:48:03,696 --> 00:48:06,063
You're definitely going to need this.

774
00:48:06,544 --> 00:48:09,110
I was spraying this on earlier,
but I don't think that's what it's for.

775
00:48:10,125 --> 00:48:13,564
This... This hairspray right now...

776
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:16,102
It's Japanese.

777
00:48:17,309 --> 00:48:18,831
It's Japanese.

778
00:48:21,962 --> 00:48:23,516

[At the similar time, other human beings

Where is the Japanese room?

785
00:48:50,196 --> 00:48:52,745
I think I'm going to go crazy!
I don't remember!

786
00:48:53,423 --> 00:48:58,362
Wait... This is it.
It's about where the items we got were made.

787
00:48:58,363 --> 00:49:03,186
[Could the water gun and the potion be in
the country room the items were made in?]

788

[The country of origin of the items that
they've received is the key to the location!]

[Worried that the zombies may also hear
if he were to contact on walkie-talkie...]

There's nothing.

America.  Let's find America!

800
00:49:50,106 --> 00:49:52,545

the water gun and the potion is hidden?]

The zombie can be eliminated once hit with
the potion inside this water gun.

813
00:51:02,906 --> 00:51:05,427
The head zombie can't die
from the water gun alone.

814
00:51:05,428 --> 00:51:07,154
You have to tear the nametag off also
to eliminate him completely.

815
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:10,019
I guess I have to ultimately eliminate it.

816

[Now that he's got the water gun...
He has to find the potion to fill it...]

- Yeah.

823

- Who, who?

- Jae Suk!  Keep searching, okay?
- Okay.

832
00:52:12,261 --> 00:52:14,157
Strange...

833
00:52:14,158 --> 00:52:16,222
Why does Kim Jong Kook keep calling my name?

834
00:52:21,312 --> 00:52:24,995
When I looked at him...
His eyes seemed a little red...

835
00:52:24,996 --> 00:52:27,119
I think there's something strange about him.

836
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:29,802
His eyes are a little red too,
and he's being strange.

837
00:52:29,803 --> 00:52:33,753
[Anyways, Jae Suk felt something weird
coming from Jong Kook]

838
00:52:33,754 --> 00:52:37,484
He could've just asked me some questions,
but he was oddly being overboard about it.

839
00:52:41,259 --> 00:52:43,068
<i>Did you find it?</i>

840
00:52:43,069 --> 00:52:44,887
Hey, where are you?

841
00:52:44,888 --> 00:52:46,783
Jae Suk, where are you?

842
00:52:48,945 --> 00:52:50,118
Me?

843
00:52:50,119 --> 00:52:51,799
<i>Where are you?</i>

844
00:52:52,575 --> 00:52:54,253
Why are you looking for me so hard?

845
00:52:56,162 --> 00:53:00,530
[Jong Kook keeps searching for Jae Suk
after seeing him with the water gun...]

846
00:53:00,531 --> 00:53:01,894
Why are you looking for me so hard?

847
00:53:03,959 --> 00:53:07,635
[And...]

848
00:53:07,636 --> 00:53:12,230
[Ji Hyo, who's eyes opened up wide
once setting eyes on him...]

849
00:53:12,231 --> 00:53:15,658
[They're starting to close in... Danger!]

850
00:53:15,659 --> 00:53:17,971
HaHa, where are you?
HaHa, where are you?!

851
00:53:21,997 --> 00:53:23,883
<i>HaHa, where are you?
HaHa, where are you?!</i>

852
00:53:24,497 --> 00:53:27,592
Jae Suk, we don't know
who the zombie is right now.

853
00:53:27,593 --> 00:53:29,291
Where are you?  Tell me quickly.

854
00:53:30,271 --> 00:53:31,908
Actually, don't tell me.  Don't tell me.

855
00:53:32,559 --> 00:53:34,624
We don't know who the zombie is right now.

856
00:53:34,957 --> 00:53:36,587
No one knows who the zombie is.

857
00:53:36,588 --> 00:53:38,638
Be careful.  Be careful.

858
00:53:38,639 --> 00:53:41,149
Many of them could already be infected.

859
00:53:42,962 --> 00:53:44,535
Don't trust anyone.

860
00:53:44,979 --> 00:53:47,224
Don't trust anyone.
Don't trust anyone.

861
00:53:49,810 --> 00:53:51,624
I really can't trust anyone.

862
00:53:51,625 --> 00:53:55,386
It could be anyone.
You're the only thing I can trust.

863
00:54:02,401 --> 00:54:07,400
[HaHa finally arrives in the Japan room
where the hairspray originated from]

864
00:54:07,900 --> 00:54:09,147
Who is it?

865
00:54:09,182 --> 00:54:13,219
You scared me!  You're not a zombie, right?
[Jae Suk just happens to be hiding in there]

866
00:54:13,220 --> 00:54:16,112
How can I be the zombie?
How did you find this room?

867
00:54:17,755 --> 00:54:20,747
My hairspray was made in Japan.

868
00:54:20,748 --> 00:54:22,716
- Made in Japan.
- Come in here.

869
00:54:25,506 --> 00:54:26,961
You said it was made in Japan?

870
00:54:26,962 --> 00:54:29,551
- You said it was made in Japan?
- Hurry!

871
00:54:29,552 --> 00:54:30,711
[Leaving the door locked because
he can't totally trust HaHa]

872
00:54:32,835 --> 00:54:34,023
It is in here.

873
00:54:35,475 --> 00:54:37,371
[There it is!  The 'R' Case!]

874
00:54:37,372 --> 00:54:41,179
[Without a doubt, the potion is inside...]

875
00:54:41,631 --> 00:54:43,004
[Huh???]

876
00:54:44,653 --> 00:54:46,893
Hey!  It's gone, it's gone!

877
00:54:46,894 --> 00:54:49,176
Jae Suk, I'm dead then!

878
00:54:50,502 --> 00:54:52,659
- Open the door.
- Someone took it!!

879
00:54:52,660 --> 00:54:55,805
Hurry up and open it!  Otherwise, I'm dead!
[Did the zombie take the potion first?!]

880
00:54:55,806 --> 00:54:58,730
I told you, someone took it!
[Panic]

881
00:54:58,731 --> 00:55:01,066
Hurry!  Open the door quickly!

882
00:55:01,067 --> 00:55:03,235
[The human beings are in a state of panic]
Someone took it!

883
00:55:03,236 --> 00:55:05,615
- I'm telling you someone took it!
- Took what?  Open the door!

884
00:55:05,616 --> 00:55:07,055
Someone took the potion!

885
00:55:07,056 --> 00:55:09,854
- Who are you?  Are you a zombie?
- I'm not a zombie!

886
00:55:09,855 --> 00:55:12,656
Jae Suk, I'm going to die.
Do you want to see me die?

887
00:55:12,657 --> 00:55:15,736
- Are you sure you're not a zombie?
- How many times have I told you that I'm not?

888
00:55:19,325 --> 00:55:22,472
- You're really not?
- Someone's coming!  Open the door!  Quickly!

889
00:55:23,444 --> 00:55:25,749
- Who are you?!
- I'm human!

890
00:55:25,750 --> 00:55:28,183
You're not a zombie?

891
00:55:29,629 --> 00:55:31,362
It's Kwang Soo!

892
00:55:31,363 --> 00:55:32,802
I'm not a zombie!

893
00:55:32,803 --> 00:55:36,423
- I'm not one yet.
- What do you mean, not yet?  Go away.

894
00:55:36,424 --> 00:55:41,348
- Show me the thing you got.
- I got a towel.

895
00:55:41,349 --> 00:55:44,121
Hand me the towel, otherwise I'm shooting.

896
00:55:44,122 --> 00:55:45,667
Why do you want the towel?

897
00:55:45,668 --> 00:55:48,000
Should I open it?  I don't know what to do.

898
00:55:49,248 --> 00:55:50,935
Hurry up and open the door.

899
00:55:50,936 --> 00:55:52,659
I really don't have anything.

900
00:55:52,660 --> 00:55:55,794
[For now,
all 3 of them hide in the Japan room]

901
00:55:55,829 --> 00:55:58,210
- Get out.
- You, get out.

902
00:55:58,211 --> 00:56:01,316
- Where was it made in?
- What is that?

903
00:56:02,005 --> 00:56:04,259
Someone already took the potion.

904
00:56:04,868 --> 00:56:06,719
The potion is gone.

905
00:56:10,348 --> 00:56:11,784
It's Ji Hyo.

906
00:56:11,785 --> 00:56:14,478
Why did you come here?

907
00:56:14,930 --> 00:56:18,916
[Zombie Ji Hyo came to check out
the dynamics of the humans]

908
00:56:18,917 --> 00:56:23,087
- What are you all doing?
- Why... Why are you so surprised?

909
00:56:23,088 --> 00:56:25,050
- What do you mean, surprised?
- Don't come in here for now.

910
00:56:25,051 --> 00:56:28,548
Why?
I have to find that and the water gun too.

911
00:56:28,549 --> 00:56:30,351
- What did you receive?  Let me see it.
- Let's see it.

912
00:56:30,352 --> 00:56:31,904
- Let's see.
- What did you get?

913
00:56:32,859 --> 00:56:36,632
[Ji Hyo readily hands over the bag
to throw off their suspicion]

914
00:56:36,667 --> 00:56:39,098
Ji Hyo, come in...

915
00:56:39,663 --> 00:56:44,063
[Jae Suk gets his butt stabbed in the
door handle during the process]

916
00:56:44,064 --> 00:56:45,902
- Jae Suk, don't go too close.
- Why?

917
00:56:46,418 --> 00:56:48,632
- Hand it over, let me see it.
- We don't know who the zombie is.

918
00:56:48,633 --> 00:56:50,593
But why are you telling me
not to get too close?

919
00:56:51,677 --> 00:56:56,746
[With each word out of their mouths,
they're starting to suspect each other]

920
00:56:56,747 --> 00:56:58,258
You're saying this pouch is it?

921
00:56:58,259 --> 00:57:00,163
All I got was that pouch.

922
00:57:01,299 --> 00:57:03,456
- Let's go, quickly!
- Give me back my pouch!

923
00:57:03,457 --> 00:57:05,871
Give me back my pouch!!

924
00:57:08,713 --> 00:57:11,511
[The humans are in a total chaos]

925
00:57:11,512 --> 00:57:15,231
[Report this to the head zombie...]

926
00:57:17,847 --> 00:57:22,026
<i>There are so many things that are
made in China these days...</i>

927
00:57:22,027 --> 00:57:25,485
Huh?  Where's the refrigerator?

928
00:57:25,486 --> 00:57:28,732
[The big nosed brother is convinced there's
something in the China room]

929
00:57:32,307 --> 00:57:35,906
[Bingo!  The big nosed brother's power of
reasoning is especially powerful today!]

930
00:57:36,732 --> 00:57:40,482
[Made in China.
Ji Hyo's pouch originated from China]

931
00:57:43,114 --> 00:57:47,691
[There it is!  It's the potion!]

932
00:57:47,692 --> 00:57:49,747
Yes!

933
00:57:51,586 --> 00:57:55,566
[Big nosed brother scores
the water gun and the potion]

934
00:58:01,437 --> 00:58:04,265
[Just wait, you zombies...!]

935
00:58:13,209 --> 00:58:20,225
[Receiving reports on everything,
and the head zombie, Gary sends his orders]

936
00:58:20,226 --> 00:58:24,778
[He still can't reveal his identity...]

937
00:58:26,766 --> 00:58:28,499
<i>Why are you asking me all of a sudden
which floor I'm on?</i>

938
00:58:31,507 --> 00:58:32,733
You scared me!

939
00:58:32,734 --> 00:58:36,917
[The distrust between humans that are
even more frightening than zombies]

940
00:58:36,918 --> 00:58:38,657
I told you, I don't have anything.

941
00:58:38,658 --> 00:58:40,638
If I had anything,
why would I be carrying this around?

942
00:58:41,456 --> 00:58:43,887
- I would've shot you already.
- I'll hold on to your water gun.

943
00:58:43,888 --> 00:58:46,385
It's really cool.

944
00:58:46,386 --> 00:58:49,914
[It's just a water gun,
but he looks so cool carrying it...]

945
00:58:49,914 --> 00:58:51,902
Stop calling this a water gun.

946
00:58:51,903 --> 00:58:53,309
It's a laser gun.

947
00:58:53,700 --> 00:58:55,801
- I know that too.
- It's a water laser gun.

948
00:58:55,802 --> 00:59:00,424
I think Kwang Soo has something in his bag.

949
00:59:00,425 --> 00:59:04,374
I don't understand why he was
so ready to hand over his stuff...

950
00:59:04,375 --> 00:59:07,160
[There are footsteps coming from above!]

951
00:59:10,499 --> 00:59:13,430
[The giraffe is totally caught]

952
00:59:16,130 --> 00:59:17,374
You, come here.

953
00:59:17,375 --> 00:59:19,043
Let me see the bag for a second.

954
00:59:20,136 --> 00:59:21,547
Let's see your bag.

955
00:59:23,316 --> 00:59:24,634
Why do you want to see my bag?

956
00:59:27,346 --> 00:59:28,980
Do you have the potion in here?

957
00:59:29,782 --> 00:59:32,507
It's just water.
I had it in here earlier too.

958
00:59:36,284 --> 00:59:37,975
How is this water?

959
00:59:37,976 --> 00:59:41,806
[What?!  The potion?!]

960
00:59:44,963 --> 00:59:48,313
[The giraffe had the potion hidden in his bag!
But why?!]

961
00:59:48,314 --> 00:59:50,753
Just because of that,
you're going to think that I'm a zombie?

962
00:59:50,754 --> 00:59:53,749
You stay right there.
Bring the bottle over here.

963
00:59:53,750 --> 00:59:58,703
- Just bring that over here.
- I'm just going to dump this out then.

964
00:59:58,704 --> 01:00:00,409
That's my potion.  I found it.

965
01:00:01,872 --> 01:00:04,355
I was going to use it when I found a water gun.
Only 1 person can use it.

966
01:00:04,356 --> 01:00:08,589
[Explosive suspicion of one another,
extreme conflict!]

967
01:00:08,590 --> 01:00:10,534
Bring me the potion.

968
01:00:10,535 --> 01:00:12,702
You're a zombie, aren't you?

969
01:00:12,703 --> 01:00:17,160
[Suddenly being accused of being a zombie.
Just what is his identity?]

970
01:00:17,161 --> 01:00:19,147
- I really am not a zombie.
- You're a zombie, right?

971
01:00:19,148 --> 01:00:23,475
- It wouldn't matter if we can share this...
- How can we share that?

972
01:00:24,694 --> 01:00:27,848
You're think we can split the potion?
[Jong Kook zombie enters...]

973
01:00:27,849 --> 01:00:32,489
- Why aren't you responding to my text?
- What text?

974
01:00:32,490 --> 01:00:35,402
- I had my phone turned off.
- Why do you have it turned off?

975
01:00:37,783 --> 01:00:41,284
- He had the potion.
- He had it, but he lied about having it.

976
01:00:41,285 --> 01:00:43,997
- The reason why is...
- It's because he's a zombie.

977
01:00:43,998 --> 01:00:47,727
- Let's see it...
- They took it away from me.

978
01:00:48,747 --> 01:00:51,456
- It's because you hid it away.
- Wouldn't you have done the same?

979
01:00:51,457 --> 01:00:53,333
- Then why did you take it from him?
- That's what I'm saying.

980
01:00:53,334 --> 01:00:55,362
Let's do this the right way.

981
01:00:55,363 --> 01:00:56,775
HaHa, did you take it
because you're a zombie?

982
01:00:56,776 --> 01:00:58,199
Why aren't you giving it to me
when I have the water gun?

983
01:00:59,081 --> 01:01:01,535
Just give him the potion back for right now.

984
01:01:01,536 --> 01:01:05,670
- I'll keep the potion in here.
- Why aren't you giving it back?

985
01:01:05,671 --> 01:01:09,794
Hey... If we keep this up,
we're all going to get infected and be ousted.

986
01:01:10,276 --> 01:01:16,068
[Ultimately, from Jong Kook's urging,
the potion goes back to the giraffe]

987
01:01:16,069 --> 01:01:18,587
- He took it from me for no reason.
- It's because you lied.

988
01:01:28,726 --> 01:01:31,662
- I have no idea who it is.
- You can't follow us again!

989
01:01:32,376 --> 01:01:36,596
[Jae Suk and the giraffe,
and Jong Kook and HaHa in pairs]

990
01:01:37,036 --> 01:01:40,650
Jae Suk.  Get Suk Jin first for right now.

991
01:01:45,157 --> 01:01:49,684
- I heard from Suk Jin on the walkie-talkie.
- Give me a little of the potion in here.

992
01:01:50,338 --> 01:01:52,740
You know I wouldn't use it on you!

993
01:01:53,174 --> 01:01:57,030
What are we each doing with our stuff?
What happens if a zombie suddenly attacks?

994
01:01:57,512 --> 01:01:58,733
Don't you think so?

995
01:01:59,139 --> 01:02:01,366
I'll give you enough to shoot one person.

996
01:02:01,367 --> 01:02:05,013
That's not even going to work.

997
01:02:22,291 --> 01:02:25,709
[Did enough of the potion go in there
for it to work?]

998
01:02:30,070 --> 01:02:33,961
You're going to have to put more in here.
It's not even working!

999
01:02:33,962 --> 01:02:36,692
But there's nothing coming out,
there's nothing I can do!

1000
01:02:36,693 --> 01:02:38,897
I can't even do anything with this.

1001
01:02:40,594 --> 01:02:42,416
I'll give you $10 for it.

1002
01:02:42,417 --> 01:02:43,927
Give me that then.

1003
01:02:44,932 --> 01:02:47,554
I'll give it to you before we leave.
You think I'm not going to give it to you?

1004
01:02:47,555 --> 01:02:50,214
Why are you seriously being like this?
It's just so pathetic!

1005
01:02:50,856 --> 01:02:53,470
I'll make sure to give it to you later.
You think I won't?

1006
01:02:55,876 --> 01:03:00,868
First, let's you and I get rid of the zombies
and go back home by ourselves.

1007
01:03:00,869 --> 01:03:02,404
That'll be fine then.

1008
01:03:09,357 --> 01:03:11,623
- Just pour it all in there!
- I'm going to keep this much.

1009
01:03:11,624 --> 01:03:12,769
[The giraffe is adamant not to give it all up]

1010
01:03:14,737 --> 01:03:17,218
It's plenty.
It's because the gun was lying sideways.

1011
01:03:17,219 --> 01:03:24,125
[Now it's able to shoot]
[Let's go hunt down the zombies!]

1012
01:03:27,045 --> 01:03:30,926
[At last, the battle between
the humans and zombies begin]

1013
01:03:30,927 --> 01:03:34,804
[It is time for the ultimate winner
to start making their moves]

1014
01:03:34,805 --> 01:03:37,346
We don't know who it is...

1015
01:03:44,909 --> 01:03:47,030
Seriously, what is Suk Jin doing?

1016
01:03:48,207 --> 01:03:49,829
Oh!  Suk Jin!

1017
01:03:51,178 --> 01:03:53,375
Did you find the potion?

1018
01:03:53,376 --> 01:03:56,541
- Did you find it?  From where?
- Yeah.

1019
01:03:57,305 --> 01:03:58,666
Where did you find it from?

1020
01:03:58,667 --> 01:04:00,765
- Are you a zombie?
- No, I told you I'm not.

1021
01:04:00,766 --> 01:04:02,346
I'm really not.

1022
01:04:02,347 --> 01:04:04,195
- Are you a zombie?
- No, I'm not.

1023
01:04:04,196 --> 01:04:07,912
Suk Jin, let'go somewhere brighter...
Suk Jin, let'go somewhere brighter...

1024
01:04:07,913 --> 01:04:12,963
[Huh...?]
[He wants to go somewhere brighter?]

1025
01:04:12,964 --> 01:04:15,630
[When the news was on earlier...]

1026
01:04:15,631 --> 01:04:18,342
<i>It is known that once the head zombie
tears off your name tag</i>

1027
01:04:18,343 --> 01:04:21,928
<i>the person will then turn into a zombie
and start to attack humans.</i>

1028
01:04:21,929 --> 01:04:25,993
<i>It is known that zombies especially
doesn't like dark places...</i>

1029
01:04:25,994 --> 01:04:28,418
Suk Jin, let's go somewhere brighter.

1030
01:04:28,419 --> 01:04:33,799
[Zombies don't like dark places?!]

1031
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:35,878
Suk Jin, let's go somewhere brighter.

1032
01:04:35,879 --> 01:04:38,171
Somewhere brighter.

1033
01:04:38,756 --> 01:04:43,074
[Aim... Shoot!]

1034
01:04:43,075 --> 01:04:47,646
[Shooting the potion onto
Kwang Soo's nametag]

1035
01:04:47,647 --> 01:04:49,613
[For now, Kwang Soo is out.
Was he really a zombie?]

1036
01:04:49,614 --> 01:04:50,650
Why did you shoot him?

1037
01:04:51,057 --> 01:04:52,988
Wait...

1038
01:04:53,849 --> 01:04:58,054
[How can this be?!
Kwang Soo was a zombie!]

1039
01:05:01,427 --> 01:05:07,176
[In the same room that Jae Suk and HaHa
were having a standoff]

1040
01:05:08,298 --> 01:05:12,206
[He was one step quicker
and found the potion!]

1041
01:05:13,573 --> 01:05:15,102
[And then of all things,
he was in the same room with the zombies...]

1042
01:05:15,103 --> 01:05:16,121
Jong Kook, I have this.

1043
01:05:16,478 --> 01:05:17,930
Didn't they say the water gun
glowed in the dark?

1044
01:05:18,363 --> 01:05:21,414
- Glow in the dark?
- Let's see it.  Turn the light off.

1045
01:05:21,415 --> 01:05:22,937
Turn it off.

1046
01:05:24,857 --> 01:05:27,218
[The reason why the zombies
don't like the dark!]

1047
01:05:27,219 --> 01:05:33,690
[Only the zombies have
a glow in the dark nametags!]

1048
01:05:33,691 --> 01:05:36,199
- You just stay still.
- Wait!  Just wait!

1049
01:05:37,322 --> 01:05:39,058
You're a zombie now.

1050
01:05:39,059 --> 01:05:41,263
Hurry up and turn the light on now.

1051
01:05:41,264 --> 01:05:46,165
You're a zombie now.
You have to start helping me out now...

1052
01:05:46,166 --> 01:05:50,855
[This is how the giraffe became a zombie]

1053
01:05:51,359 --> 01:05:55,738
[The giraffe really was a zombie!
Stellar acting!]

1054
01:05:57,458 --> 01:06:01,288
- Hey, Jae Suk!  Look at this!
- It glows in the dark!

1055
01:06:01,289 --> 01:06:03,255
[Discovered the zombies have
a glow in the dark nametags!]

1056
01:06:03,256 --> 01:06:05,570
The ones in dark places are zombies.

1057
01:06:05,571 --> 01:06:08,329
No.  The ones in bright places are zombies.

1058
01:06:08,330 --> 01:06:09,984
The ones in bright places are the zombies.

1059
01:06:09,985 --> 01:06:12,134
To know that I got ousted
by people like this...

1060
01:06:12,135 --> 01:06:14,672
[Kwang Soo zombie-Out!]

1061
01:06:16,071 --> 01:06:21,388
[My power has grown weaker...
Someone has been taken down!]

1062
01:06:23,689 --> 01:06:26,452
Jae Suk?  Jae Suk... Jae Suk?

1063
01:06:28,218 --> 01:06:31,764
[HaHa and Mr. Capable zombie
are headed in their way]

1064
01:06:31,765 --> 01:06:33,588
We're going to shoot them
both unconditionally.

1065
01:06:33,589 --> 01:06:36,017
We have no choice.  No other choice.

1066
01:06:36,018 --> 01:06:38,438
Jae Suk.  I can see you clearly.

1067
01:06:38,439 --> 01:06:43,359
Suk Jin, I can see you too.
[Reflection shown in the glass.  Fail]

1068
01:06:43,893 --> 01:06:47,366
- Kwang Soo's not here.
- Kwang Soo got ousted!

1069
01:06:47,367 --> 01:06:50,039
<i>Kwang Soo's ousted,
he's not answering his phone.</i>

1070
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:53,441
- What?  I'm a human.
- Are you a zombie?

1071
01:06:53,442 --> 01:06:56,544
- I'm a human!
- Are you human too?

1072
01:06:57,653 --> 01:07:00,269
It's not zombie, but a drowsy human.

1073
01:07:01,468 --> 01:07:04,696
Jae Suk.  Let's go get Gary.
Let's go get Gary for now.

1074
01:07:04,697 --> 01:07:08,130
[Just then!]
Where is Gary?

1075
01:07:08,131 --> 01:07:12,641
[Big nosed brother, locked on target!]

1076
01:07:12,642 --> 01:07:15,283
[Shoots!]

1077
01:07:15,284 --> 01:07:18,289
[Carrying out the act to the end]

1078
01:07:18,290 --> 01:07:20,659
- Jong Kook, you're a human?
- No way... He's a human?

1079
01:07:22,663 --> 01:07:27,384
You're a zombie...
[Jong Kook fools everything with his acting]

1080
01:07:27,385 --> 01:07:29,893
But he's not the head zombie?
[Jong Kook-out!]

1081
01:07:29,894 --> 01:07:31,868
<i>Jong Kook must not be the head zombie.</i>

1082
01:07:34,198 --> 01:07:37,373
[Someone else has been taken down again!]

1083
01:07:37,932 --> 01:07:40,914
[In that case,
time to start making my moves...]

1084
01:07:41,505 --> 01:07:46,141
No other way than to step up myself...]

1085
01:07:55,794 --> 01:08:00,821
[On the floor right above,
Suk Jin, HaHa and Ji Hyo are facing off]

1086
01:08:03,372 --> 01:08:09,060
[Planning on using the elevator
to attack from behind]

1087
01:08:14,154 --> 01:08:16,282
I'm going to have to shoot
as soon as the door opens.

1088
01:08:16,283 --> 01:08:20,760
[As soon as the door opens,
planning on shooting no matter who it is]

1089
01:08:20,761 --> 01:08:22,605
I have no idea who's who right now.

1090
01:08:27,948 --> 01:08:30,136
<i>See?  Jae Suk is here.</i>

1091
01:08:30,137 --> 01:08:34,824
I knew this was going to happen.
[HaHa and Ji Hyo, alert to Jae Suk]

1092
01:08:34,825 --> 01:08:37,284
- What is this?
- We've never formed any plans of attack.

1093
01:08:38,027 --> 01:08:39,982
Why didn't you come to the dark?

1094
01:08:39,983 --> 01:08:43,535
- I said I'll go!
- Really? Then I'll stay here.

1095
01:08:43,536 --> 01:08:46,074
- I'll stay here.
- I'll stay here too.

1096
01:08:46,075 --> 01:08:48,869
- Then I'll go downstairs.
- Go somewhere dark.

1097
01:08:49,707 --> 01:08:53,692
- Hey, where did Gary go?!
- Seriously... Where is Gary?

1098
01:08:55,033 --> 01:08:57,449
- Hurry up and go down there.
- Fine, I'll go.  I'm going right now.

1099
01:08:57,450 --> 01:09:01,422
Don't come down here.
Don't shoot me in the back.

1100
01:09:01,423 --> 01:09:04,857
[The suspicious big nosed brother
follows HaHa to the dark]

1101
01:09:13,422 --> 01:09:17,843
[Huh?  Who is she nodding her head to?]

1102
01:09:28,130 --> 01:09:32,950
[It's Gary!]

1103
01:09:38,046 --> 01:09:39,636
Hey, it's Gary!

1104
01:09:39,637 --> 01:09:43,085
- Jae Suk...
- Where have you been?!

1105
01:09:43,086 --> 01:09:44,176
It's Gary!
[The head zombie finally is out!]

1106
01:09:44,177 --> 01:09:46,043
- What?  What about me?
- It's Gary, Gary!

1107
01:09:46,044 --> 01:09:47,658
What about me, Jae Suk?

1108
01:09:48,566 --> 01:09:50,446
Hurry up and run!

1109
01:09:50,447 --> 01:09:53,777
[Flustered Jae Suk and Suk Jin
makes a run for now]

1110
01:09:53,778 --> 01:09:55,572
Jae Suk, why are you running away?!

1111
01:09:58,513 --> 01:10:03,021
[Suspicious of Gary after seeing him
for the first time in a long time?]

1112
01:10:03,427 --> 01:10:04,890
It's Gary!

1113
01:10:06,811 --> 01:10:08,990
Jae Suk, let's talk!

1114
01:10:11,332 --> 01:10:12,935
I think it's Gary.

1115
01:10:17,304 --> 01:10:19,119
Can't we have fun like this
for a little bit longer?

1116
01:10:19,120 --> 01:10:21,457
They're running away
just from the sight of me.

1117
01:10:23,066 --> 01:10:28,065
Wow... Is it Gary?
Is Gary ultimately the head zombie?

1118
01:10:32,011 --> 01:10:37,212
This place should be safe for now.
[Hiding in the dark away from the zombies]

1119
01:10:39,293 --> 01:10:41,057
What is going on...?

1120
01:10:42,583 --> 01:10:45,526
No matter how much I called him,
he didn't answer.  He finally shows up now.

1121
01:10:46,290 --> 01:10:50,327
[All of a sudden worrying about
big nosed brother he's been separated from]

1122
01:10:50,328 --> 01:10:52,678
It's one thing if we're together,
but you don't know when you're apart.

1123
01:10:52,679 --> 01:10:54,631
I think I'm going to go crazy.

1124
01:10:55,902 --> 01:10:56,949
What's that?

1125
01:10:58,702 --> 01:11:03,325
[Huh?  HaHa came down here?]

1126
01:11:05,714 --> 01:11:06,989
What the heck?

1127
01:11:06,990 --> 01:11:09,016
You can't come here, can you?

1128
01:11:09,017 --> 01:11:12,801
This is a dark place.  Why are you coming?

1129
01:11:12,802 --> 01:11:15,856
How are you coming? It's dark in here.
[HaHa's nametag glows in the dark!]

1130
01:11:15,857 --> 01:11:18,591
- Aren't you a zombie?
- How am I a zombie?

1131
01:11:18,592 --> 01:11:22,087
Aren't you a zombie?
[HaHa was a zombie!]

1132
01:11:29,145 --> 01:11:32,895
[Yoo-ruce Willis had is water gun taken away!]

1133
01:11:45,582 --> 01:11:50,735
[How is he going to face off the zombies
without a water gun?]

1134
01:11:51,652 --> 01:11:57,021
[HaHa's win for revealing his identity
and forcefully attacking!]

1135
01:11:57,022 --> 01:12:01,070
[All of a sudden, the zombies get the edge]

1136
01:12:01,950 --> 01:12:03,290
I'm going to go crazy.

1137
01:12:03,658 --> 01:12:04,863
What do I do?

1138
01:12:05,409 --> 01:12:09,154
[The zombies are everywhere!]

1139
01:12:10,389 --> 01:12:15,844
[Out of all the zombies,
the head zombie is the most afraid?]

1140
01:12:21,002 --> 01:12:23,815
Let's fool Suk Jin.

1141
01:12:27,870 --> 01:12:30,682
[As soon as they lay their eyes on the other,
they start to shoot!]

1142
01:12:30,683 --> 01:12:33,436
Suk Jin, I took his water gun.

1143
01:12:33,437 --> 01:12:36,169
- Hey, I'll shoot.
- I have one too.

1144
01:12:36,170 --> 01:12:39,603
- Where did you get it?
- I'm a human.

1145
01:12:39,604 --> 01:12:43,120
- Jae Suk?  You're not a human!
- I'm a human!

1146
01:12:43,121 --> 01:12:45,435
[If you go that way,
human life will be extinct!]

1147
01:12:49,104 --> 01:12:50,506
What's going on?

1148
01:12:50,507 --> 01:12:52,441
Suk Jin's in danger!

1149
01:12:53,297 --> 01:12:57,570
[He can't even help with his
water gun taken away...]

1150
01:13:04,313 --> 01:13:06,997
- Hurry up and call Gary here.
- Where did Jae Suk go?

1151
01:13:06,998 --> 01:13:09,373
- We're in Bangkok.
- Where did Jae Suk go?

1152
01:13:10,569 --> 01:13:16,515
[Whether you save the big nosed brother...
or get your water gun back...]

1153
01:13:22,981 --> 01:13:24,691
<i>Don't come here!</i>

1154
01:13:25,715 --> 01:13:28,524
- Hurry, hurry!
- Did Jae Suk get ousted?

1155
01:13:28,978 --> 01:13:31,111
- How did you guys oust him?
- We ousted him.

1156
01:13:31,450 --> 01:13:34,654
HaHa... You stay here.
I'll be right back.

1157
01:13:34,655 --> 01:13:38,885
You guard him here.
Gary and I'll take care of Jae Suk.

1158

[Ji Hyo's going away...
Now is the chance!]

1159

[This really is...
Yoo-ruce Willis' true worth!]

1160
01:14:04,103 --> 01:14:06,726
Ji Hyo!!

1161
01:14:06,727 --> 01:14:08,944
Ji Hyo!

1162
01:14:08,945 --> 01:14:12,691
- Gary?  Where are you?
- I'm in the hallway.

1163
01:14:12,692 --> 01:14:15,204
Here.  Can you hear my voice?  Hurry!

1164
01:14:15,205 --> 01:14:19,096
Hurry!  You zombie...!
Hurry, Suk Jin!  Shoot him!

1165
01:14:21,330 --> 01:14:24,933
[Shoots HaHa on his nametag!]
Ji Hyo...!!

1166
01:14:24,934 --> 01:14:27,080
Ji Hyo!!

1167
01:14:27,404 --> 01:14:29,990
[HaHa really was a zombie!]

1168
01:14:29,991 --> 01:14:33,182
[HaHa zombie-Out!]

1169
01:14:34,696 --> 01:14:38,010
- You weren't ousted!
- Let's hurry, Suk Jin.

1170
01:14:39,619 --> 01:14:43,970
[The zombie Monday Couple that is just
one step too late]

1171
01:14:45,914 --> 01:14:48,639
- You've been ousted?
- I had even taken his water gun from him...

1172
01:14:49,664 --> 01:14:52,096
This really is no joke.

1173
01:14:52,097 --> 01:14:54,399
I thought you've been ousted.
Why did you have your water gun taken?

1174
01:14:54,400 --> 01:14:58,515
Well... I thought if I stayed in the dark,
the zombies wouldn't be able to come after me!

1175
01:14:58,516 --> 01:15:00,661
But he kept on coming,
so I thought maybe I was wrong.

1176
01:15:00,662 --> 01:15:02,464
I was unsure and wanted to check,

1177
01:15:02,465 --> 01:15:04,876
but that's when he attacked me
and took my gun away from me.

1178
01:15:04,877 --> 01:15:09,169
[Anyways,
the gun broke during their tussle earlier]

1179
01:15:09,170 --> 01:15:10,784
This isn't working.  What do I do?

1180
01:15:12,731 --> 01:15:15,556
[The thing doesn't even look charged...]

1181
01:15:15,557 --> 01:15:19,424
Seeing how Ji Hyo was going to get Gary...

1182
01:15:19,425 --> 01:15:22,738
- Gary is the head zombie.
- He's the head zombie.

1183
01:15:22,739 --> 01:15:25,245
[Seeing that Gary was being brought down,
they're sure Gary is the head zombie]

1184
01:15:26,596 --> 01:15:31,229
[The zombie Monday Couple are doing
an undercover operation]

1185
01:15:41,487 --> 01:15:44,810
[Ji Hyo... Right out there.
He's right out there]

1186
01:15:45,939 --> 01:15:51,503
[Big nosed brother fleeing for now
after seeing Gary]

1187
01:15:52,290 --> 01:15:54,879
I don't know if I should go out there or not.

1188
01:16:02,108 --> 01:16:04,367
I want to win...

1189
01:16:10,710 --> 01:16:14,213
[Head zombie Gary's ambush!]

1190
01:16:14,854 --> 01:16:20,037
[Zombies are starting to attack the human!]

1191
01:16:20,038 --> 01:16:23,076
Jae Suk!!  Jae Suk!!

1192
01:16:27,727 --> 01:16:33,178
[He's rushing to where he heard
the big nosed brother's voice coming from!]

1193
01:16:38,906 --> 01:16:41,696
[Huh?  Why the talking instead of screaming?]

1194
01:16:41,697 --> 01:16:44,847
[Suk Jin... This isn't the time for you
to feel bad...]

1195
01:16:47,363 --> 01:16:50,995
[What does that mean?]

1196
01:16:52,959 --> 01:16:54,868
[What's up with Suk Jin?]

1197
01:16:58,022 --> 01:17:04,192
[It sounded like Suk Jin
and Gary were talking...]

1198
01:17:04,193 --> 01:17:05,777
What's going on with Suk Jin?

1199
01:17:05,778 --> 01:17:07,320
Why are they whispering?

1200
01:17:09,248 --> 01:17:11,056
Look at this...!

1201
01:17:11,057 --> 01:17:15,244
[Could it be that his only human colleague
Suk Jin is also a zombie?]

1202
01:17:15,245 --> 01:17:16,760
You heard it too, right?

1203
01:17:17,115 --> 01:17:18,223
Right?

1204
01:17:22,290 --> 01:17:24,236
Jae Suk... Jae Suk!

1205
01:17:27,318 --> 01:17:28,838
I don't think I can do this alone.

1206
01:17:28,839 --> 01:17:30,319
Come here.

1207
01:17:32,902 --> 01:17:34,769
[Huh? Wait...]

1208
01:17:34,770 --> 01:17:36,374
I don't think I can do this alone.

1209
01:17:36,375 --> 01:17:37,756
Come here.

1210
01:17:39,724 --> 01:17:42,612
Suk Jin.  I heard something earlier.
What happened?

1211
01:17:42,613 --> 01:17:44,181
I ran away from them.

1212
01:17:44,182 --> 01:17:47,473
[Just what is Big Nosed bother?]
There's 2 of them now.  Let's run away.

1213
01:17:48,593 --> 01:17:51,170
- Does this even work?
- It works.

1214
01:17:51,171 --> 01:17:52,854
I don't know if mine's working.

1215
01:17:52,855 --> 01:17:56,196
[His water gun is damaged to a point
where he doesn't even know if it works]

1216
01:17:56,197 --> 01:17:57,725
You should take the lead.

1217
01:17:58,196 --> 01:18:00,183
- You should be able to shoot at least 3 times.
- It doesn't work.

1218
01:18:00,184 --> 01:18:02,534
- It doesn't work.
- It doesn't work?

1219
01:18:03,340 --> 01:18:05,952
So you take the lead
and shoot them if they appear.

1220
01:18:05,953 --> 01:18:10,030
We need to go... And attack.

1221
01:18:10,031 --> 01:18:11,615
Once Gary is ousted, it's over.

1222
01:18:11,616 --> 01:18:18,183
[Seeing this... Suk Jin is still human?]
Pil-Chok-Cross!

1223
01:18:26,558 --> 01:18:31,176
[Jae Suk heading towards Suk Jin...
Shoots!]

1224
01:18:31,177 --> 01:18:34,584
[Shoots the nametag!]

1225
01:18:34,585 --> 01:18:36,230
Suk Jin, why didn't you come in the dark?

1226
01:18:36,231 --> 01:18:38,013
There really was enough to shoot
3 times in here.

1227
01:18:38,014 --> 01:18:40,990
Are you sane right now?
I'm a human!

1228
01:18:48,116 --> 01:18:50,124
Suk Jin, why did you ask me to
come out to a bright place?

1229
01:18:50,125 --> 01:18:54,948
I wasn't sure if you were or not,
then you stopped and told me to come out.

1230
01:18:54,949 --> 01:18:56,920
My feet wouldn't take further steps.

1231
01:18:56,921 --> 01:18:59,185
What was I supposed to do,
when my feet wouldn't move?

1232
01:18:59,186 --> 01:19:02,183
[Zombie Suk Jin-Out!]
Go, Suk Jin.

1233
01:19:02,184 --> 01:19:04,559
- How could you do that?
- I was a human once...

1234
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:08,133
- Just go.
- I just couldn't go to the dark.

1235
01:19:08,134 --> 01:19:10,182
If you go in the jail,
Jong Kook isn't going to leave you alone.

1236
01:19:11,236 --> 01:19:15,668
[He may really become a zombie...]

1237
01:19:18,575 --> 01:19:20,209
What do I do...?

1238
01:19:20,210 --> 01:19:24,113
No matter what...
There are 2 of them, Ji Hyo and Gary.

1239
01:19:24,114 --> 01:19:28,656
[Will he be able to beat the zombies
on his own?]

1240
01:19:31,452 --> 01:19:37,024
[The 2 zombies going up against him]

1241
01:19:41,740 --> 01:19:48,093
[As soon as Jae Suk's voice is heard,
they're moving to an ambush location!]

1242
01:19:52,180 --> 01:19:55,246
[Even though he's a master of the water gun,
Jae Suk is feeling very burdened]

1243
01:19:56,004 --> 01:19:58,231
This really is crazy...

1244
01:19:58,232 --> 01:20:00,155
This is going up against evil.

1245
01:20:00,712 --> 01:20:02,404
This is no joke.

1246
01:20:15,856 --> 01:20:17,539
<i>Ji Hyo!</i>

1247
01:20:20,274 --> 01:20:21,985
I can smell Ji Hyo's perfume!

1248
01:20:23,039 --> 01:20:26,821
[Ji Hyo's perfume?]

1249
01:20:26,822 --> 01:20:29,475

Ji Hyo...?</i>

1250
01:20:31,060 --> 01:20:33,607
It's Ji Hyo's perfume...
Is Ji Hyo...?

1251
01:20:36,583 --> 01:20:38,087
It's Ji Hyo's perfume.

1252
01:20:42,437 --> 01:20:43,851
I can smell Ji Hyo's perfume...

1253
01:20:45,345 --> 01:20:48,374
I'm serious.
I'm not kidding, but I can really smell it.

1254
01:20:48,375 --> 01:20:50,703
[Jae Suk is backtracking after
smelling Ji Hyo's perfume]

1255
01:20:54,323 --> 01:20:57,024
I can smell Ji Hyo's perfume here.
[His nose, which is scarier than a zombie]

1256
01:20:57,908 --> 01:21:01,611
I know she was here earlier...
But I'm sure she left awhile ago.

1257
01:21:06,825 --> 01:21:10,020
[Ambush failed because of
the scent of her perfume!]

1258
01:21:10,021 --> 01:21:14,075
- It's because of your perfume!
- How do I know what that smells like?

1259
01:21:15,442 --> 01:21:17,545
[Just who the heck is he?]

1260
01:21:19,214 --> 01:21:22,618
[Anyways, Yoo-ruce Willis' amazing nose!]

1261
01:21:22,653 --> 01:21:23,932
This is exhausting.

1262
01:21:24,158 --> 01:21:30,188
I'm getting exhausted... But my heart...
My heart is pounding ever faster!

1263
01:21:30,189 --> 01:21:32,927
I'm seriously about to go crazy!
I'm going to go crazy.

1264
01:21:32,928 --> 01:21:35,922
This must be why I carry the water gun.
This is the feeling.

1265
01:21:37,458 --> 01:21:38,983
I'm going insane.

1266
01:22:07,896 --> 01:22:09,088
I can smell it again?!

1267
01:22:10,700 --> 01:22:14,563
[A total dog's nose!
He detects Ji Hyo's perfume again!]

1268
01:22:15,872 --> 01:22:17,441
<i>I can smell Ji Hyo's perfume again!</i>

1269
01:22:19,530 --> 01:22:21,252
I wonder if she was here for awhile?

1270
01:22:26,470 --> 01:22:27,740
See?  Right here...

1271
01:22:28,248 --> 01:22:30,030
It doesn't smell as strong as it was before.

1272
01:22:38,053 --> 01:22:40,016
- He went that way.
- Again?

1273
01:22:48,225 --> 01:22:53,301
[He can smell it?  But since he can't see,
his nervousness is doubled!]

1274
01:22:53,680 --> 01:22:55,316
