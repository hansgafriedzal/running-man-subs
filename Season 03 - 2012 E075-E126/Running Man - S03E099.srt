01:09:59,470 --> 01:10:02,760
You saw me tear it off, right?
There's nothing here.

1154
01:10:02,760 --> 01:10:04,460
She has all 3 on her!

1155
01:10:04,460 --> 01:10:08,420
Ji Hyo has all 3!
[Must rip Ji Hyo's off to gain all their land]

1156
01:10:08,420 --> 01:10:09,760
<i>Calm down.</i>

1157
01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:11,440
Tae Kwon... Just trust your instincts
and tear it off her back.

1158
01:10:13,500 --> 01:10:16,530
-It's all on her back...
-Go away.

1159
01:10:16,870 --> 01:10:18,420
Just grab one of her arms.

1160
01:10:20,490 --> 01:10:22,090
[But is Ji Hyo really the one
who got rid of Im Ho?]

1161
01:10:22,090 --> 01:10:25,520
Jong Kook, think about it carefully right now.
It'll be 3 against 2.

1162
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:27,640
-Jong Kook.
-It'll be 3 against 2.

1163
01:10:27,640 --> 01:10:29,630
[If Ji Hyo is ousted,
then Song Nation collapses]

1164
01:10:29,630 --> 01:10:32,420
Kwang Soo!  Kwang Soo!
Don't rip it off.

1165
01:10:32,420 --> 01:10:35,330
Kwang Soo, don't rip it off.
[Tae Kwon gets rid of Ji Hyo's name tag]

1166
01:10:35,330 --> 01:10:39,250
-She had all 3!
-Yes!  It's ours. He got it, it's ours.

1167
01:10:39,250 --> 01:10:41,650
Let's see just how well you end up.

1168
01:10:41,650 --> 01:10:43,370
-Hey!
-I didn't rip it off!

1169
01:10:43,370 --> 01:10:46,070
You planned this whole thing, didn't you?
Let's see just how well you end up!

1170
01:10:46,070 --> 01:10:47,420
I didn't plan it, I just participated!

1171
01:10:50,500 --> 01:10:55,480
[All 3 of Song Nation's lands
now belong to Kwon Nation]

1172
01:10:56,540 --> 01:10:58,800
Hey... You planned this whole thing!

1173
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:02,670
[Now that we think about it,
Kwang Soo today...]

1174
01:11:02,670 --> 01:11:07,570
[Kwang Soo's been really forward
about ripping the name tags off...]

1175
01:11:07,570 --> 01:11:10,210
[Wait...]

1176
01:11:14,460 --> 01:11:17,530
-Ji Hyo, you've worked hard.
-You've worked hard, Ji Hyo.

1177
01:11:17,530 --> 01:11:20,110
-Kwang Soo's being really strange...
-Kwang Soo is acting strange.

1178
01:11:20,120 --> 01:11:21,280
Did Kwang Soo rip yours off?

1179
01:11:21,880 --> 01:11:26,190
Kwang Soo... and Tae Kwon were flanking
both of my sides...

1180
01:11:26,190 --> 01:11:29,450
Tae Kwon did end up tearing it off,
but Kwang Soo...

1181
01:11:29,900 --> 01:11:31,740
[Kwang Soo has been especially aggressive
about ousting Suk Jin and Ji Hyo today...]

1182
01:11:31,950 --> 01:11:33,770
<i>The way I see it...</i>

1183
01:11:34,140 --> 01:11:37,150
[Huh?  Tae Kwon has something to say?]

1184
01:11:37,150 --> 01:11:38,660
The way I see it...

1185
01:11:38,940 --> 01:11:40,970
Kwang Soo killed Im Ho.

1186
01:11:40,970 --> 01:11:42,990
[Kwang Soo eliminated Im Ho,
his own team member?]

1187
01:11:42,990 --> 01:11:44,100
-I did?
-Yeah.

1188
01:11:44,100 --> 01:11:45,510
Why would I kill him?

1189
01:11:45,730 --> 01:11:48,670
I asked Suk Jin earlier...

1190
01:11:49,220 --> 01:11:50,630
I did.

1191
01:11:50,630 --> 01:11:52,280
-Suk Jin said he didn't know what happened.
-I asked him...

1192
01:11:52,790 --> 01:11:55,010
He wasn't acting.  He was being sincere.

1193
01:11:55,470 --> 01:11:57,210
Why would I tear his off?

1194
01:11:57,720 --> 01:12:00,690
I'm sure he tore it off while Im Ho
was walking in front of him.

1195
01:12:02,340 --> 01:12:05,270
<i>I'm sure he tore it off while Im Ho
was walking in front of him.</i>

1196
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,980
[Who's the owner of this hand that
got rid of Im Ho?]

1197
01:12:10,100 --> 01:12:15,500
[The truth behind that incident
is finally being revealed!]

1198
01:12:16,530 --> 01:12:18,910
Im Ho...

1199
01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:21,550
<i>Im Ho...</i>

1200
01:12:24,070 --> 01:12:25,830
<i>Was ousted by Kwang Soo.</i>

1201
01:12:26,570 --> 01:12:29,620
[Lee Kwang Soo...
Just what is going on with him today?]

1202
01:12:31,310 --> 01:12:36,340
[2 hours before filming started this morning]

1203
01:12:39,380 --> 01:12:42,410
[A secret meeting with the Pd]

1204
01:12:48,110 --> 01:12:52,950
[This looks like the scene when something
is normally given to a spy...]

1205
01:12:53,770 --> 01:12:57,280
[Touched Kwang Soo tightly grabs
onto the PD's hand]

1206
01:12:57,280 --> 01:13:00,890
-It's been too long, right?
-It hasn't been long, it's the first time!

1207
01:13:02,980 --> 01:13:04,680
<i>Yes!  I did it!</i>

1208
01:13:05,460 --> 01:13:11,090
[In all the kingdoms of the history,
there are warriors and mistresses...]

1209
01:13:14,090 --> 01:13:19,760
[Spy Kwang Soo given the order to
oust all the members of Running Man]

1210
01:13:24,710 --> 01:13:27,650
[Im Ho, always have your back towards me.
I'll protect it from the back]

1211
01:13:27,690 --> 01:13:31,330
[Deciding the first person to oust
will be his own King]

1212
01:13:33,800 --> 01:13:38,010
[After tempting him to come to a place
where no one is around...]

1213
01:13:45,870 --> 01:13:48,080
[Coldly ousting his own member, Im Ho]

1214
01:13:51,630 --> 01:13:56,340
[Without even knowing the reason,
Im Ho is ousted just like that]

1215
01:13:56,340 --> 01:13:58,410
I'm sorry... I'm sorry.

1216
01:13:59,050 --> 01:14:01,310
I'll explain it all to you later!

1217
01:14:01,310 --> 01:14:05,190
[Just like this,
the spy's dream bloomed bigger...]

1218
01:14:07,310 --> 01:14:08,890
The way I see it...

1219
01:14:08,890 --> 01:14:10,770
Kwang Soo was the one who killed Im Ho.

1220
01:14:11,160 --> 01:14:12,520
I did?

1221
01:14:12,520 --> 01:14:15,320
-Why would I kill him?
-I'm sure he did while Im Ho was in front.

1222
01:14:15,320 --> 01:14:17,320
-Why would I?!
-I can smell it.

1223
01:14:17,320 --> 01:14:20,580
I didn't do that!  I didn't oust Im Ho!
[Tae Kwon's sharp senses]

1224
01:14:20,580 --> 01:14:21,970
We'll have to ask him about that.

1225
01:14:22,830 --> 01:14:26,230
Um... That's not...
You're not supposed to do that.

1226
01:14:26,230 --> 01:14:27,580
Why are you stuttering?

1227
01:14:28,930 --> 01:14:31,570
Are you going to abandon him?
Then give him to us.

1228
01:14:31,570 --> 01:14:34,440
-Wait... You'll be left alone then.
-Him?

1229
01:14:34,450 --> 01:14:36,450
If he's a traitor, then give him to us.

1230
01:14:37,020 --> 01:14:39,160
Wait a second... Wait.

1231
01:14:39,170 --> 01:14:42,580
I've really got a lot in my mind right now,
so give me a little time.

1232
01:14:42,580 --> 01:14:44,150
[If the atmosphere is like this,
Kwang Soo's going to be suspected more!]

1233
01:14:46,220 --> 01:14:48,080
-No.
-You're suspecting that I did it?

1234
01:14:48,090 --> 01:14:49,670
-Just a minute...
-It's Kwang Soo.

1235
01:14:49,680 --> 01:14:52,180
What have I done for you to suspect me?

1236
01:14:52,180 --> 01:14:54,650
-I didn't say that you did it.
-Why are you suspecting me?

1237
01:14:54,650 --> 01:14:56,740
Because I definitely saw you
walking away with Im Ho.

1238
01:14:56,990 --> 01:14:59,860
-I told you I was then separated...
-Are you a spy?

1239
01:14:59,860 --> 01:15:02,040
Come on now...

1240
01:15:02,710 --> 01:15:04,860
What's that, a spy?
What's a spy?

1241
01:15:04,870 --> 01:15:08,360
What's a spy?  What is that?  Huh?

1242
01:15:08,740 --> 01:15:11,020
Are there spies here?
One per team?

1243
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:15,290
What if I'm not?
What are you going to do if I'm not?

1244
01:15:15,290 --> 01:15:17,610
If you're not?  Well then...

1245
01:15:17,610 --> 01:15:19,240
If you're not, then we'll have to
treat you to a nice meal.

1246
01:15:19,240 --> 01:15:22,800
[It's not like he's a kid, but make it up
to him by buying him something to eat...]

1247
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:25,920
-Come on... Something to eat?
-I don't think it's Tae Kwon.  Not him.

1248
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:27,960
I don't think it's Tae Kwon.

1249
01:15:28,690 --> 01:15:30,570
Go upstairs.  Go upstairs for now.

1250
01:15:30,570 --> 01:15:32,260
-Why are you sending me away?
-Just go upstairs for now.

1251
01:15:32,260 --> 01:15:35,240
-You should be helping me out!
-I need to...!

1252
01:15:35,240 --> 01:15:40,250
Kwang Soo, this is the best I can do for you
for now... This is my last act of love for you.

1253
01:15:40,260 --> 01:15:43,530
Go upstairs for now.
Give me some time to think.  Okay?

1254
01:15:43,530 --> 01:15:45,660
-Give me some time to think.
-Jong Kook...

1255
01:15:45,660 --> 01:15:47,740
-Give me some time to think first.
-This makes no sense...

1256
01:15:47,740 --> 01:15:52,400
Give me some time to think first.  Okay?
This is the best thing I can do for you.

1257
01:15:52,410 --> 01:15:53,880
Just go upstairs for now.

1258
01:15:53,880 --> 01:15:58,740
[He can't even argue to stay together
and is just going upstairs]

1259
01:16:13,840 --> 01:16:15,640
I'm still not even close...

1260
01:16:17,890 --> 01:16:20,370
Spy's road is long and dangerous.

1261
01:16:20,370 --> 01:16:22,780
I'm not right for this yet.
This wasn't the right time.

1262
01:16:22,780 --> 01:16:24,460
[Reflecting that he's not right to be
a spy just yet]

1263
01:16:26,110 --> 01:16:28,640
Please give me another chance in 2 years.

1264
01:16:28,640 --> 01:16:31,200
This wasn't the right time yet.
I rushed it, I'm sorry.

1265
01:16:36,270 --> 01:16:38,470
Ever since Im Ho's been ousted
the atmosphere has been really weird.

1266
01:16:38,470 --> 01:16:41,210
Even though we haven't had it
happen too often lately,

1267
01:16:41,250 --> 01:16:46,310
but when it comes to spies,
there could be 2...

1268
01:16:46,350 --> 01:16:48,690
Two people can...

1269
01:16:49,460 --> 01:16:51,790
-With me?
-Yeah.

1270
01:16:51,790 --> 01:16:52,790
It could be you two.

1271
01:16:53,280 --> 01:16:57,190
[Now the suspicion is being
flung to Ha Ha too?]

1272
01:16:57,190 --> 01:16:59,610
Why are you asking me all this right now then?

1273
01:16:59,610 --> 01:17:03,590
First...
Let's ask each other some questions first.

1274
01:17:03,590 --> 01:17:05,630
Everything we've all said and our behaviors...

1275
01:17:05,630 --> 01:17:09,140
Jong Kook is by himself on the first floor,
so go downstairs quickly.

1276
01:17:09,150 --> 01:17:11,030
Jong Kook is alone.

1277
01:17:12,490 --> 01:17:15,730
[Receiving the tip]
What did you say?

1278
01:17:15,730 --> 01:17:18,240
<i>Jong Kook is by himself downstairs!</i>

1279
01:17:18,860 --> 01:17:21,930
<i>Hurry.  Jong Kook is alone downstairs.
Tae Kwon!</i>

1280
01:17:22,840 --> 01:17:25,820
Tae Kwon... He's alone on the 1st floor now,
Tae Kwon...!

1281
01:17:25,820 --> 01:17:27,140
[Plans to use Tae Kwon to
eliminate Jong Kook early]

1282
01:17:27,150 --> 01:17:30,710
[It's not weird that he's getting
so antsy all of a sudden?]

1283
01:17:31,950 --> 01:17:33,850
I'm really going to go crazy...

1284
01:17:34,670 --> 01:17:39,080
Hurry, hurry, hurry!
[Tae Kwon, please come on down]

1285
01:17:40,160 --> 01:17:42,960
[Appearing out of nowhere all of a sudden
just like superman]

1286
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,100
[Superman vs. Hulk?]

1287
01:17:45,100 --> 01:17:46,330
Tae Kwon...

1288
01:17:46,340 --> 01:17:51,240
[Since there's so much suspicion going around,
cease the pending attack for now]

1289
01:17:51,240 --> 01:17:54,610
My head hurts... Seriously!
My head is killing me now!

1290
01:17:54,610 --> 01:18:00,440
What's the point of ceasing?  Get rid of him
at this given chance, you dummies!!

1291
01:18:00,450 --> 01:18:03,580
[Ha Ha overreacting because he thinks
Jong Kook's suspicions are weird]

1292
01:18:04,460 --> 01:18:05,760
[Who's right here?]

1293
01:18:11,200 --> 01:18:13,150
What's this?

1294
01:18:14,090 --> 01:18:15,430
Then...

1295
01:18:15,470 --> 01:18:19,260
Then I'll stay out of it and the 3 of you
oust Kwang Soo out first and come to me.

1296
01:18:19,270 --> 01:18:21,430
-Then you're going to stay out of it?
-Yeah.  I'll stay out of it.

1297
01:18:21,430 --> 01:18:24,330
Then we can out him if he stays out.
That's a good thing.

1298
01:18:24,340 --> 01:18:29,320
There's a point to what I'm saying right?
The three of you go...

1299
01:18:29,330 --> 01:18:31,620
-And you can oust Kwang Soo.
-Okay.  You stay out of it then.

1300
01:18:31,620 --> 01:18:34,770
What Jong Kook said is right.
First, let's oust Kwang Soo first.

1301
01:18:35,960 --> 01:18:38,400
[Me? Me?]

1302
01:18:41,010 --> 01:18:43,040
I really don't think I can be a spy.

1303
01:18:43,500 --> 01:18:45,110
I can't do it anymore.

1304
01:18:45,640 --> 01:18:47,410
I'm just going to turn myself in.

1305
01:18:48,940 --> 01:18:50,680
I can't do it anymore.

1306

[About to have a mental breakdown
from trying to be a spy]

1307

Why are you trusting someone else
instead of trusting your own teammate?

1310
01:19:09,090 --> 01:19:11,830
It's not about that,
but when Im Ho got ousted...

1311
01:19:11,830 --> 01:19:15,190
-Why are you trusting someone else?
-Im Ho got ousted all of a sudden!

1312
01:19:15,190 --> 01:19:17,980
-Just get him and oust him first.
-And you heard what Jong Kook said.

1313
01:19:17,980 --> 01:19:23,350

You hurt me when you suspected me...?

01:19:23,350 --> 01:19:25,570
-Okay, it's not like that.
-So we're going to keep suspecting each other?

Im Ho isn't someone who'd just
be easily had like that...

Even if he were up against someone,
he's not someone that would lose easily...

1318

-You're not?
-No, I'm not.

1328
01:20:09,700 --> 01:20:11,370

1329

I haven't even heard that there is a spy.

that's when the real fight is going to begin.

[Anyways, everyone is waiting
for him to get ousted]

1333

1334
01:20:26,090 --> 01:20:29,260
-Ah... so because of me...
-That's right, because of you.

1335
01:20:29,260 --> 01:20:32,410
-So it doesn't matter what I say.
-We don't need it.  We're going to get you.

1336
01:20:32,410 --> 01:20:34,650
Jong Kook says to get you.

1337
01:20:35,020 --> 01:20:36,760
What if you tear it off and I'm not the spy?

1338
01:20:36,770 --> 01:20:39,080
-What if I'm not the spy?
-I told you, I'll buy you something to eat.

1348

1357
01:21:41,510 --> 01:21:44,090
-Jae Suk!
-Get Ha Ha!  Hurry and get him.

his name off, we can win!
