[The 2 humans looking like they're not
going to budge from where they are]

990

-We won't touch you.
-Jae Suk... Jae Suk...

991
01:05:03,229 --> 01:05:06,815
-At a time like this... Let's ring the bell.
-Should we ring the bell?

[If they do this now,
they may be able to get Jong Kook!]

995
01:05:19,423 --> 01:05:22,219
-You go...
-Just stay here then.

996
01:05:22,220 --> 01:05:27,067
-Hurry, hurry!

After getting him to come out...

1003
01:05:52,323 --> 01:05:54,175
Jae Suk, are you ready?

1004
01:05:56,189 --> 01:05:58,422
Ring it now, now!  Now!  Now!

1005

[This is the chance to stop the time!]

1012
01:06:49,973 --> 01:06:54,030
[The bell of the Gods, it's ringing!]
We did it, we rang the bell!

1013
01:06:56,554 --> 01:06:58,493
I think they'll be able to get them...
I think they'll be able to get them...

1014
01:07:12,934 --> 01:07:12,934
[As the bell rings...
The human world's time stops...]

[Human Kwang Soo also in his place...]

1016
01:07:23,005 --> 01:07:24,509
This...

[First taking the seal weapon...]

1019
01:07:31,992 --> 01:07:34,964
I'm not going to move.  Wait, wait!

1020
01:07:34,965 --> 01:07:36,539
Wait, wait!

1021
01:07:36,540 --> 01:07:39,560
[Getting rid of human Kwang Soo tag!]

1022
01:07:42,836 --> 01:07:44,688
I even gave these to you...

1023

All my relatives are gathered watching....

1026
01:07:56,027 --> 01:07:59,275
-Kwang Soo... I have no other choice.
-Why me...?

1027
01:07:59,276 --> 01:08:00,463
I have to stay alive...

1028
01:08:00,464 --> 01:08:04,099
Kwang Soo...
Great job with all the past episodes.

1029
01:08:04,652 --> 01:08:08,759
[But still not forgetting the friendship]

1030
01:08:09,360 --> 01:08:14,106
[Jae Suk... Don't be like this...
Just let me slap you once when we're done]

1031
01:08:14,107 --> 01:08:15,842
[Not that...
Just let me slap you once after recording]

1032
01:08:16,675 --> 01:08:19,122
I'm so annoyed with you right now,
I feel like I'm going to go crazy.

1033
01:08:19,465 --> 01:08:20,920
-Please...
-Fine.

1034
01:08:20,921 --> 01:08:25,817
[Anyways... Human Kwang Soo-Out!]
I give you permission.

1035

[Eros loses Human Jong Kook]

1038
01:08:48,143 --> 01:08:51,905

This is just becoming a baggage carrying it.

1039
01:08:55,450 --> 01:09:00,296
[The truth is this is the weapon that could've
worked on Kwang Soo had he been a God]

1040
01:09:00,297 --> 01:09:02,753
God or not...

1041
01:09:02,754 --> 01:09:04,811
How is this being a God?

1042
01:09:06,428 --> 01:09:08,276
All I do is walk around!

1043
01:09:08,702 --> 01:09:11,877
Isn't this a water room?
A room of beverages or something?

1044
01:09:11,878 --> 01:09:13,449
[Heading to the beverage room out of thirst]

1045
01:09:15,285 --> 01:09:17,994
What kind of God is thirsty like this...

1046
01:09:17,995 --> 01:09:21,969
And feels so hungry from just running...
How is this being a God?

1047
01:09:22,004 --> 01:09:25,134
Getting tired and sleepy from walking...
How is this being a God?

1048

Be quiet... Quiet.
Is there anyone around?

1051
01:09:49,138 --> 01:09:50,937
Come here, come here.

1052

[As if nothing's going on...]
We have to fight amongst ourselves too.

1056

Okay, I got it.

1057
01:10:17,437 --> 01:10:23,672
Okay I got it...
From all the running... I'm too tired.

1058
01:10:25,843 --> 01:10:27,211
You found something, didn't you?

1059
01:10:27,212 --> 01:10:28,721
I haven't found anything.

1060
01:10:29,364 --> 01:10:30,669
I really haven't found anything.

1061
01:10:31,467 --> 01:10:34,046
-Ah... I know you just found something.
-No, I didn't.  I'm serious.

1062
01:10:38,300 --> 01:10:41,761
[Discovered the Pandora's box!]

1063

[You're saying Athena Ji Hyo's weakness
is her ankles?]

1072
01:11:28,897 --> 01:11:33,575
[Soon thereafter,
Apollo discovers another Pandora's box!]

1073
01:11:33,576 --> 01:11:36,390

-We can't kill each other for now.
-Why?

1089
01:12:46,653 --> 01:12:49,278
-Where is it Aphrodite?  Where is it?
-What?

1090
01:12:49,279 --> 01:12:53,734
-The shackles... The shackles.
-I'll take care of Ji Hyo.

1091
01:12:54,018 --> 01:12:57,918
But right now... How can you hide that?

1092
01:12:57,919 --> 01:13:00,534
No... I just left it for a moment
because it was heavy.

1093
01:13:00,535 --> 01:13:02,652
-How did you know it was Ji Hyo?
-I just did..

1094
01:13:02,653 --> 01:13:05,492
I've already got it all down.

1095
01:13:07,770 --> 01:13:12,395
Let's get rid of Jong Kook first...
Then take care of Ji Hyo and Ha Ha...

-What's Ha Ha's?

1097
01:13:14,206 --> 01:13:16,280
-Kiss?
-They said kiss.

1098
01:13:16,281 --> 01:13:17,500
I kissed him earlier.

1099
01:13:18,468 --> 01:13:19,977
Did you just kiss him?

1100
01:13:19,978 --> 01:13:23,069
Lipstick!
Ha Ha has it!

1101
01:13:23,890 --> 01:13:26,089
You have to kiss him with the lipstick on!

-That's not it...

1103

-I just licked my lips...
-That's not what I meant!

1106
01:13:37,820 --> 01:13:41,988
It doesn't mean that a girl has to do it,
but there's a special lipstick for it.

1107

Several of us has to work together.

But Ji Hyo... What is Hee Sun's weakness?

1113
01:14:08,581 --> 01:14:11,934
I told Gary this...
But is it the mirror?  The mirror maybe?

1114
01:14:12,454 --> 01:14:14,975
Hee Sun was carrying
the mirror around earlier...

1115
01:14:14,976 --> 01:14:17,744
[It's now!]

1116
01:14:26,906 --> 01:14:30,769
Could it be she has to look at her own face?
[Left unprotected]

What did you get after you killed Kwang Soo?

1130
01:15:35,018 --> 01:15:37,005
Well... I got this seal.

1131
01:15:37,006 --> 01:15:40,819
-This seal...
-But I don't know what it is.

1132
01:15:40,820 --> 01:15:44,549
Did Kwang Soo tell me to imprint Gary's foot?
What was it that he said?

1133
01:15:44,550 --> 01:15:46,904
You have to imprint it on a bare foot...

1134
01:15:46,905 --> 01:15:49,190
-But that's not how you kill them.
-Then what?

1135
01:15:49,537 --> 01:15:52,750
-I have to rub it off with this for him to die.
-What did you say?

1136
01:15:52,751 --> 01:15:55,166
So there's some kind of a mark on Gary?

1137

Where is he right now?

1138
01:15:57,763 --> 01:15:59,865
Then this isn't meant for Gary's foot?

1139
01:16:01,318 --> 01:16:03,198
Right?  This isn't Gary's foot.

1140
01:16:07,951 --> 01:16:10,543
You can't be looking at me like that.

1141
01:16:11,012 --> 01:16:12,940
His is a kiss...

1142
01:16:13,108 --> 01:16:19,462
[The more he thinks about it,
the target for the seal is Aphrodite]

-Wait Jae Suk...
-Hee Sun... Is it you?

1144
01:16:24,183 --> 01:16:25,497
No way...

1145
01:16:26,327 --> 01:16:28,440
Then where am I supposed to use this?

1146
01:16:29,153 --> 01:16:30,805
