00:13:00,252 --> 00:13:02,740
<i>On the other hand...</i>

174
00:13:06,054 --> 00:13:08,679
<i>Soo Hyun, who's been listening to everything</i>

175
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:11,123
<i>At Nanji campground...</i>

176
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:14,341
<i>Sangam Nanji campground...!</i>

177
00:13:15,939 --> 00:13:18,318
<i>Already studying the structure
through a 3D image</i>

178
00:13:27,566 --> 00:13:32,547
<i>Today's gold is... Mine!</i>

179
00:13:33,393 --> 00:13:35,012
Everyone be careful today.

180
00:13:35,013 --> 00:13:40,645
<i>Not even dreaming of the existence of the boss
and thinking it's a rivalry between the gold</i>

181
00:13:40,646 --> 00:13:44,544
<i>Nanji campground</i>

182
00:14:00,102 --> 00:14:04,193
<i>The black troop
that's entering the campground</i>

183
00:14:06,733 --> 00:14:11,273
<i>Among that team... Is Soo Hyun</i>

184
00:14:17,847 --> 00:14:22,946
<i>Receiving the help
of the campers to infiltrate</i>

185
00:14:26,981 --> 00:14:30,997
<i>And...</i>

186
00:14:30,997 --> 00:14:35,416
<i>The giant ice blocks placed
throughout the campground?</i>

187
00:14:37,306 --> 00:14:43,557
<i>Then this is... The Running Man's mission?</i>

188
00:14:44,407 --> 00:14:48,642
<i>Oh... So if those were put to use...!</i>

189
00:14:55,153 --> 00:14:57,970
<i>The ice block in front of the tent...!</i>

190
00:14:59,347 --> 00:15:02,517
<i>Good... In that case, that's the place.</i>

191
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:14,901
<i>With the intense summer sun,
inside of the tent is a sauna</i>

192
00:15:16,231 --> 00:15:20,142
<i>Okay, from here... I will get rid of them</i>

193
00:15:22,676 --> 00:15:28,776
<i>Will Soo Hyun's plan succeed?</i>

194
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:33,371
-We're almost there.
-Do you remember Nanji camp?

195
00:15:33,372 --> 00:15:35,418
<i>Running Man arriving at Nanji camp</i>

196
00:15:35,419 --> 00:15:37,303
It really has been awhile.

197
00:15:45,335 --> 00:15:47,637
<i>Nervous</i>

198
00:15:48,457 --> 00:15:50,225
Since the ice bock is right out front...

199
00:15:50,226 --> 00:15:51,889
As long as they stand there
with their back turned...

200
00:15:53,817 --> 00:15:56,773
<i>It sounds easy... But the heart is pounding</i>

201
00:15:57,247 --> 00:15:59,630
They're not even here yet,
but why am I so nervous?

202
00:16:01,458 --> 00:16:03,202
Since this is the first location...

203
00:16:04,728 --> 00:16:07,839
The target is... Gary.

204
00:16:10,305 --> 00:16:12,551
And Mr. Capable.

205
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:20,419
<i>Preparing the special solution</i>

Hey... There it is.

208
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:35,729
-Wow... It's been awhile.
-It's now starting!

209
00:16:37,924 --> 00:16:40,938
<i>They're here...!</i>

210
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:47,562
<i>A familiar location
that they've been to before</i>

211
00:16:47,563 --> 00:16:49,187
-It was really cold back then...
-It was totally freezing.

212
00:16:49,188 --> 00:16:51,584
Oh!  It's ice!

213
00:16:52,843 --> 00:16:54,421
<i><i>For your first mission...</i></i>

214
00:16:54,422 --> 00:16:57,438
<i><i>There are ice blocks
placed throughout the park</i></i>

215
00:16:57,439 --> 00:17:00,924
<i><i>The mission letter is
placed within those ice blocks</i></i>

216
00:17:00,925 --> 00:17:02,243
So we have to break them...

217
00:17:02,244 --> 00:17:04,345
<i>The first person to break the mission free...</i>

218
00:17:04,346 --> 00:17:09,140
<i>only that person will be able to determine
whether the turtle they have is real or not.</i>

219
00:17:11,108 --> 00:17:12,193
<i>Go!</i>

220
00:17:12,194 --> 00:17:14,220
<i>Start!</i>

221
00:17:14,221 --> 00:17:16,369
There's ice... There's ice over there!

222
00:17:18,752 --> 00:17:20,062
It's ice!!

223
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:22,238
Is that it over there?

224
00:17:23,242 --> 00:17:26,698

00:17:30,534 --> 00:17:34,181
Hey this is... The ice is...!

227
00:17:34,182 --> 00:17:35,633
How are we supposed to break this?

228
00:17:38,309 --> 00:17:39,754
Why is this toy hammer even here?

229
00:17:39,755 --> 00:17:42,541
-What is this toy hammer?
-How are we supposed to do this?

230
00:17:42,542 --> 00:17:45,859
<i>Rather pathetic tools around the ice...</i>

231
00:17:46,384 --> 00:17:48,019
How can we do this?!

232
00:17:56,406 --> 00:17:58,958
<i>Jae Suk and Ji Hyo running madly</i>

233
00:18:01,886 --> 00:18:06,632

<i>Jae Suk and Ji Hyo!</i>

236

<i>Ji Hyo who was one step late is
headed towards another location...</i>

238
00:18:21,938 --> 00:18:23,274
I don't know if this is going to work.

239
00:18:23,433 --> 00:18:26,795
If I concentrate all my strength and hit
the middle, it'll split right down the middle.

240
00:18:28,918 --> 00:18:32,830
<i>Chattering away while not even knowing
the danger that he's been put himself in</i>

241

<i>If I concentrate all my strength and hit
the middle, it'll split right down the middle.</i>

You didn't know that, did you?

243
00:18:37,147 --> 00:18:42,333
<i>But Jae Suk's facing the tent...</i>

244
00:18:42,334 --> 00:18:45,633
<i>How will he shoot in this situation?</i>

245
00:18:51,309 --> 00:18:54,614
You'll be surprised when it splits in half.
Hold on tight to that.

246
00:18:55,599 --> 00:18:57,424
<i>He has to turn around!</i>

247
00:18:58,043 --> 00:18:59,518
Gun Yul... Make sure to get this.

248
00:19:05,197 --> 00:19:07,209
Why did they put the toy hammer here?

249
00:19:11,104 --> 00:19:13,787
<i>Please... Turn your body just a little!</i>

250
00:19:13,788 --> 00:19:15,906
I'm sorry!  I'm going to borrow this!

251
00:19:16,774 --> 00:19:18,545
I'll borrow this for a moment.

252
00:19:18,546 --> 00:19:21,233
<i>Just then... HaHa grabs a hammer...?
Thank you.</i>

253

<i>The ambitious dreams of the first attack

257
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:55,655

<i>My luck...</i>

259
00:20:00,589 --> 00:20:03,305
<i>Is no one coming?</i>

-Where did you get that?
-I'm taking care of it.

265
00:20:23,785 --> 00:20:27,987
How can you say that?
I don't think this will work.  I need a hammer.

266
00:20:36,073 --> 00:20:37,514

276

I got him first!

345
00:26:15,008 --> 00:26:18,995
-I figured it out earlier too.
-I knew about it first.  I found Gold Wan!

346
00:26:18,996 --> 00:26:20,889
<i>Arguing over the capture of Gold Wan</i>

347
00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:23,818
-Jong Kook...
-I knew it as soon as I saw it.

348
00:26:23,819 --> 00:26:25,481
<i>Transporting to Gold Wan's hideout somewhere</i>

349
00:26:26,527 --> 00:26:29,436
<i>Huh?  Jong Kook's bag?</i>

350
00:26:30,038 --> 00:26:35,015
<i>Thief Jae Suk stealthily searching
through Jong Kook's bag</i>

351
00:26:35,016 --> 00:26:36,391
I knew about it before you did.

352
00:26:38,332 --> 00:26:42,775
Hey, Dong Wan... Hey...
Why don't you let me take you in?

353
00:26:42,776 --> 00:26:44,287
<i>Stolen Jong Kook's gold turtle!</i>

354
00:26:44,322 --> 00:26:45,461
Do you want me to set you free?

355
00:26:48,076 --> 00:26:50,404
-Dong Wan, get out!
-Hurry up and run!

356
00:26:50,405 --> 00:26:53,046
<i>Trying to set Dong Wan free?</i>

357
00:26:57,762 --> 00:26:59,767
<i>However the tiger
isn't letting go of his grip</i>

358
00:26:59,768 --> 00:27:02,258
<i>Gold Wan becoming a joke</i>

359
00:27:03,550 --> 00:27:05,115
Run, Dong Wan!

360
00:27:05,116 --> 00:27:08,784
<i>The tiger keeping a firm grip on Gold Wan</i>

361
00:27:08,785 --> 00:27:11,262
-Run!  Run!
-Run away!

362
00:27:11,263 --> 00:27:12,862
Run away!

363
00:27:14,343 --> 00:27:17,410
<i>Mr. Capable...
Succeeds in finding Gold Wan!</i>

364
00:27:19,218 --> 00:27:23,071
<i>Since Kim Jong Kook was the quickest
to bring Gold Wan here...</i>

365
00:27:23,072 --> 00:27:26,860
<i>We will give him the chance to check
to see if his gold is the real one.</i>

366
00:27:26,861 --> 00:27:28,389
Let him.  His is not real.

367
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:31,175
-Let's go.
-Can't we all go?

368
00:27:31,176 --> 00:27:32,943
You have to let us know for sure.

369
00:27:32,944 --> 00:27:35,094
They can only find out if they take out
the gold they have themselves, right?

370
00:27:35,095 --> 00:27:37,254
But if they don't have one, it doesn't matter?

371
00:27:38,169 --> 00:27:39,720
Gold Wan?

372
00:27:40,567 --> 00:27:43,281
<i>Mission's 1st place winner, Jong Kook-
Entering Gold Wan's chambers</i>

373
00:27:43,282 --> 00:27:46,104
That little...
He only knows to use his strength.

374
00:27:46,105 --> 00:27:49,608
-He's still just a foolish young man...
-He can't even take care of his own things.

375
00:27:49,608 --> 00:27:50,943
Please give me your gold.

376
00:27:59,045 --> 00:28:02,086
Where did the gold go?
Did the gold fall out?

377
00:28:02,087 --> 00:28:05,408
Where did my gold go?
<i>Flustered</i>

378
00:28:06,903 --> 00:28:08,392
I know I put the gold in here!

379
00:28:09,333 --> 00:28:11,372
Here he comes, here he comes.  He knows.

380
00:28:11,373 --> 00:28:12,854
He's mad, he's mad.

381
00:28:12,855 --> 00:28:14,534
I know without a doubt
that I put it in here earlier.

382
00:28:15,947 --> 00:28:18,493
-Is Jong Kook angry?
-I'm sure that he is.

383
00:28:18,494 --> 00:28:22,483
<i>The gathering of herbivores
watching the carnivore warily</i>

384
00:28:22,484 --> 00:28:24,741
Anyways, it's his fault for not
taking care of his own things.

385
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:27,688
I think someone took it!

386
00:28:27,689 --> 00:28:29,916
Someone took it out of the bag
when I wasn't paying attention earlier.

387
00:28:29,917 --> 00:28:32,571
<i>Bingo!</i>

388
00:28:32,572 --> 00:28:34,398
Who took my gold out of my bag?

389
00:28:34,398 --> 00:28:38,373
What do you mean, who took it out?

390
00:28:38,828 --> 00:28:41,906
When you're the one who couldn't take care
of your own thing, how can you blame...

391
00:28:41,907 --> 00:28:44,040
Someone took it out when I was
dragging Dong Wan, right?

392
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,089
<i>The tiger seems angry...</i>

393
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:47,673
-Stop right there...
-Don't come here.

394
00:28:47,674 --> 00:28:49,404
<i>Collectively cringing</i>

395
00:28:49,405 --> 00:28:52,399
There are 6 of us right now!
Keep your manners.

396
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,224
<i>Just raising their voices while
remaining seated out of fear</i>

397
00:28:54,225 --> 00:28:57,019
This show is just full of thieves...

398
00:28:57,020 --> 00:29:00,095
-What is that supposed to mean?
-All you guys do is steal...!

399
00:29:00,096 --> 00:29:02,559
Don't you remember earlier?
All 7 of us are thieves!

400
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:05,930
<i>I guess calling you thieves is right...
You're a thief too!</i>

401
00:29:06,318 --> 00:29:07,691
Look here...

402
00:29:07,692 --> 00:29:10,845
Since you're at fault too
for not being more cautious...

403
00:29:10,846 --> 00:29:13,096
Let us listen to it too from 3 steps away.

404
00:29:13,651 --> 00:29:15,768
-3 steps away...
-Yeah, let's do that.

405
00:29:15,769 --> 00:29:19,536
-How does that sound everyone!
-Great!  We like it!

406
00:29:19,537 --> 00:29:22,894
-Just 3 steps away.  It's 3 steps!
-Fine.  Let's do that.

407
00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:26,791
-Everyone, let's go.
-Since it's already in this situation...

408
00:29:26,792 --> 00:29:30,275
<i>Now they're all about to find out whether the
first place winner has the real gold or not</i>

409
00:29:32,343 --> 00:29:34,482
Let's pretend that I never stole it.

410
00:29:35,328 --> 00:29:37,409
-Wait...
-Let's see what they say about it.

411
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:40,504
<i>Hand over the gold.  It has to be put
on the reader to know if it's real or not</i>

412
00:29:40,505 --> 00:29:44,205
We'll just stay out here,
so go in and find out first.

413
00:29:44,206 --> 00:29:49,777
Right now... I'm going to start
tearing through all you guys!

414
00:29:49,778 --> 00:29:51,297
Yoo Jae Suk stole it!

415
00:29:51,298 --> 00:29:54,327
-Captain Yoo did...
-Wait... Jong Kook, let's do it this way.

416
00:29:54,328 --> 00:29:56,169
Let's just two of us hear it.
All of you, go!

417
00:29:58,961 --> 00:30:02,888
<i>The world of herbivores that attacks
the carnivore whenever they get a chance</i>

418
00:30:02,889 --> 00:30:04,036
You're the thief!

419
00:30:04,037 --> 00:30:07,957
-We didn't do it...
-You suck the blood out of everyone.

420
00:30:07,958 --> 00:30:11,318
Jong Kook.  I picked this up for you
when you were being careless with it.

421
00:30:11,319 --> 00:30:13,069
<i>Ultimately, Jae Suk admits to being a thief</i>

422
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:15,008
No, this is mine.

423
00:30:15,009 --> 00:30:18,721
-Jong Kook, shall we...
-Who told me that it was Jae Suk earlier?

424
00:30:18,722 --> 00:30:20,547
I was the one who told you!  It was me!

425
00:30:20,548 --> 00:30:22,379
You were being too hateful earlier.

426
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:23,428
<i>Excluding HaHa for telling on Jae Suk</i>

427
00:30:23,429 --> 00:30:27,774
-Since Gary's shirt is gold color...
-Yes, I understand.  Thank you, sir!

428
00:30:27,775 --> 00:30:29,648
<i>Ultimately, it's decided
that only Gary will enter</i>

429
00:30:29,649 --> 00:30:32,513
Gary and I will find out then.

430
00:30:32,514 --> 00:30:35,641
If you hadn't said anything,
we all could've found out!

431
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:41,583
<i>Sniping out of embarrassment.
The lucky star, Gary</i>

432
00:30:43,835 --> 00:30:46,035
I will measure it now.

433
00:30:56,761 --> 00:30:59,093
What are you guys doing out there?!

434
00:30:59,094 --> 00:31:03,318
What are you doing?
I told you not to come up here!

435
00:31:06,508 --> 00:31:09,784
Jong Kook!  Don't worry.
I'll get rid of them all for you.

436
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:13,778
Everyone get out of here!

437
00:31:14,211 --> 00:31:16,297
-I didn't know that someone was in there.
-I'm really curious...

438
00:31:16,298 --> 00:31:18,584
-I'll measure it now.
-Yes, I understand.

439
00:31:19,798 --> 00:31:24,944
<i>Will... Mr. Capable's gold...</i>

440
00:31:24,945 --> 00:31:30,705
<i>Be real or fake?</i>

441
00:31:34,099 --> 00:31:37,233
<i>Green means real, red means fake</i>

442
00:31:38,832 --> 00:31:41,562
<i>Fake!</i>

443
00:31:43,363 --> 00:31:46,303
-The weighing is over.
-Mine too please...

444
00:31:48,778 --> 00:31:50,507
<i>Refusing to weigh anymore</i>

445
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:55,118
<i>You've been ousted anyways...
What's the point of finding out?</i>

446
00:31:56,158 --> 00:31:58,068
<i>It's gotten pretty quiet...</i>

447
00:32:02,266 --> 00:32:06,050
<i>Boss Soo Hyun leaving the tent while others
are involved in weighing the gold</i>

448
00:32:06,776 --> 00:32:09,733
<i>Bending his head to hide his identity
from the other campers...</i>

449
00:32:12,273 --> 00:32:14,363
<i>Please don't spread any rumors...</i>

450
00:32:20,742 --> 00:32:27,735
<i>Now, just like a silent shadow...
Moving to the Wondang market</i>

451
00:32:31,388 --> 00:32:34,408
<i>Running Man still unaware of the boss</i>

452
00:32:34,408 --> 00:32:38,480
Let's not betray each other over
such little things anymore.

453
00:32:38,773 --> 00:32:40,761
Even the Chairman told us not to earlier!

454
00:32:40,972 --> 00:32:47,081
Gary... All you did was reap the benefits
of my hard work...

455
00:32:47,835 --> 00:32:51,874
I've seen the kinder side of Jong Kook.
<i>Complimenting the tiger</i>

456
00:32:52,890 --> 00:32:55,760
-Gary, you know don't you?
-No, I don't know.

457
00:32:56,176 --> 00:32:58,720
<i>Tsk Tsk... I guess you don't know that
you'll be automatically ousted later either</i>

458
00:33:06,176 --> 00:33:08,084
<i>This is Wondang.</i>

459
00:33:10,128 --> 00:33:15,144
<i>This is... The last chance of
water gun sniper attack</i>

460
00:33:20,244 --> 00:33:22,553
<i>Wondang market</i>

461
00:33:25,223 --> 00:33:28,132
<i>Interior of the market that's much
busier than the campground</i>

462
00:33:32,130 --> 00:33:35,240
Those girls recognized me!

463
00:33:35,241 --> 00:33:39,268
They recognized you?
<i>Seemed to have recognized Soo Hyun's car</i>

464
00:33:43,692 --> 00:33:46,020
<i>They recognized you just from the car?</i>

465
00:33:46,021 --> 00:33:48,902
<i>Extremely nervous</i>

466
00:33:48,903 --> 00:33:50,505
Running Man is nerve-wracking.

467
00:33:50,506 --> 00:33:52,300
See? They're not leaving.  Not leaving.

468
00:33:53,786 --> 00:33:57,561
<i>Extremely nervous Soo Hyun.
Concerned about every eye watching him</i>

469
00:33:59,355 --> 00:34:02,700
They're following... They're following.
They're following us.

470
00:34:04,647 --> 00:34:07,693
<i>Oh?  They do seem to be following...</i>

471
00:34:08,455 --> 00:34:11,161
<i>Panic</i>

472
00:34:12,538 --> 00:34:14,727
<i>What to do?</i>

473
00:34:22,035 --> 00:34:25,039
Why do I have to hide out in here like this...

474
00:34:25,528 --> 00:34:28,041
<i>Miserable boss's life...</i>

475
00:34:30,645 --> 00:34:33,271
They're texting.
They're calling their friends.

476
00:34:33,272 --> 00:34:35,602
<i>Really?</i>

477
00:34:40,143 --> 00:34:44,820
<i><i>We're at the entrance to Wondang market...

478
00:34:48,545 --> 00:34:50,600
I don't know... I'm sure someone will show.

479
00:34:50,601 --> 00:34:52,220
Bring everyone.

480
00:34:53,627 --> 00:34:57,371
I think that's what she's texting.
<i>The boss sure has an imagination...</i>

481
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:01,938
<i>This is big trouble...</i>

482
00:35:02,872 --> 00:35:06,674
-Maybe we'll get to eat something good.
-It's been a long time since we've been here.

483
00:35:07,475 --> 00:35:10,435
Hello... Hello.  Hello...

484
00:35:10,436 --> 00:35:13,961
<i>Gladly greeting all the shoppers
and the workers at the market</i>

485
00:35:16,894 --> 00:35:19,169
<i>What is the mission at this place?</i>

486
00:35:19,170 --> 00:35:22,630
First... Why don't everyone
weigh themselves with me?

487
00:35:22,631 --> 00:35:25,287
What?
<i>Weight?</i>

488
00:35:25,288 --> 00:35:26,807
Don't be like this...!

489
00:35:28,457 --> 00:35:31,980
<i>0.1 ton.  Measure of total body weight

Ji Hyo, get up there...
<i>And Blank Ji Hyo...</i>

493
00:35:44,746 --> 00:35:46,769
Ji Hyo, we can just delete 100.
So just get up there.

494
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:49,777
<i>Ji Hyo+ Hwa Jin PD = 153.55kg</i>

-You weigh 53 kg?
-53 kg...?

496
00:35:52,634 --> 00:35:56,461
Now... This contains $10 for your activities.

497
00:35:56,688 --> 00:36:01,181

00:49:38,353 --> 00:49:44,007
<i>The terror you felt back then...
I'll make you feel it again!</i>

668
00:49:49,359 --> 00:49:52,779
<i>Mr. Capable's number 1 target, Haroro</i>

669
00:50:04,675 --> 00:50:06,280
<i>What just...passed by?</i>

670
00:50:11,433 --> 00:50:14,184
<i>What is that monstrous sound?</i>

671
00:50:21,616 --> 00:50:24,841
Even though I may be like this...

672
00:50:24,842 --> 00:50:30,184
A little while ago...
I played the role of a King.

673
00:50:30,762 --> 00:50:33,060
But this is what I'm doing now...

674
00:50:33,270 --> 00:50:36,783
<i>What to do...
The King's confidence is shaky...</i>

675
00:50:37,875 --> 00:50:41,777
<i>All we see in front of us now...
Is a nervous...and good looking young man!</i>

676
00:50:41,777 --> 00:50:46,255
Even if they were to see me...
They can't even see my name tag.

677
00:50:46,256 --> 00:50:49,976
And I can...like this...

678
00:50:51,831 --> 00:50:57,419
<i>Turning off the light for now
because voices can be heard outside</i>

679
00:51:02,138 --> 00:51:05,121
It doesn't matter to me
whose name gets torn off.

680
00:51:05,980 --> 00:51:08,610
Because I did it by myself the last time.

681
00:51:11,641 --> 00:51:15,676
<i>Oh!  Soo Hyun's in there!</i>

682
00:51:20,881 --> 00:51:24,646
<i>If he's discovered already,
then everything is over!</i>

683
00:51:43,845 --> 00:51:47,367
<i>Was the door somehow locked?</i>

684
00:51:49,448 --> 00:51:53,710
<i>Locked the door right away earlier
when it seemed like someone was approaching</i>

685
00:51:54,803 --> 00:52:00,260
<i>Thank goodness...
If it hadn't been locked, game over!</i>

686
00:52:00,610 --> 00:52:05,383
<i>Soo Hyun averts a crisis
with an instantaneous wit</i>

687
00:52:12,098 --> 00:52:13,873
I almost screamed out loud...

688
00:52:19,647 --> 00:52:24,550
<i>On the other hand, Mr. Capable searching for
HaHa with fire in his eyes</i>

689
00:52:26,847 --> 00:52:29,459
<i>HaHa!</i>

690
00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:34,423
<i>You're caught...!  Why you!!</i>

691
00:52:36,450 --> 00:52:37,755
What the heck?

692
00:52:38,258 --> 00:52:41,375
<i>He has been awakened in the same hallway!</i>

693
00:52:41,376 --> 00:52:45,426
<i>Mr. Capable, Jong Kook</i>

694
00:52:46,527 --> 00:52:48,033
Ha Dong Hoon! (HaHa)

695
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:59,489
<i>Just like mentioned,
HaHa escaping so that he can survive</i>

696
00:53:00,762 --> 00:53:04,152
<i>Even escaping into the costume design room!</i>

697
00:53:04,825 --> 00:53:10,882
<i>HaHa... HaHa!
<i>There's only one target... HaHa!</i></i>

698
00:53:15,902 --> 00:53:17,596
I'm so scared...

699
00:53:19,964 --> 00:53:22,398
This is a variety show...
A variety show...

700
00:53:23,545 --> 00:53:27,023
<i>Lately feeling terrorized...
Just what is his fate?</i>

701
00:53:27,273 --> 00:53:30,984
<i>On the other hand,
Jae Suk is shopping in the wardrobe storage</i>

702
00:53:30,985 --> 00:53:31,944
Gun Hyul...

703
00:53:32,804 --> 00:53:35,078
We need to get a fall suit.

704
00:53:35,647 --> 00:53:39,851
<i>Even though he can't buy it,
indulging in some window shopping</i>

705
00:53:40,388 --> 00:53:41,863
A nice suit...

706
00:53:43,446 --> 00:53:47,595
<i>Wow... Tightly packed costumes!</i>

707
00:53:47,596 --> 00:53:48,968
Isn't this pretty?

708
00:53:55,387 --> 00:53:57,307
<i>Huh?</i>

709
00:53:58,593 --> 00:54:01,591
<i>Discovers a box with 'R' sticker!</i>

710
00:54:01,592 --> 00:54:04,368
<i>What kind of luck is this
during shopping?</i>

711
00:54:12,622 --> 00:54:14,448
<i>If you combine the words written
on the bouillon</i>

712
00:54:14,449 --> 00:54:18,872
you'll find out where the
final destination is!

713
00:54:26,411 --> 00:54:28,599
I just opened it, and look at this!

714
00:54:30,239 --> 00:54:33,257
<i>He just randomly opened one,
and right in there...!</i>

715
00:54:36,452 --> 00:54:39,141
'So'

716
00:54:39,476 --> 00:54:42,311
<i>Jae Suk- 'Byul', Gary- 'So' discovered</i>

717
00:54:51,085 --> 00:54:54,526
<i>Does HaHa know someone in the green room?</i>

718
00:54:54,527 --> 00:54:57,829
<i>Actor Sohn Hyun Joo that met
Soo Hyun earlier!</i>

719
00:54:57,830 --> 00:54:59,445
I'm shooting Running Man right now, sir.

720
00:54:59,446 --> 00:55:03,013
<i>Greeting HaHa warmly too</i>

721
00:55:03,014 --> 00:55:08,361
I've been watching your show...
And I'm so mad it's about to drive me crazy!

722
00:55:08,361 --> 00:55:09,666
Thank you...
For watching Running Man on your busy schedule.

723
00:55:09,667 --> 00:55:12,457
I mean, I guess you're watching
The Chaser, not Running Man.

724
00:55:12,458 --> 00:55:16,111
But the feeling of it is somewhat similar.
We're always chasing each other too.

725
00:55:16,112 --> 00:55:21,060
<i>But... He could tell HaHa about
seeing Soo Hyun earlier...?</i>

726
00:55:21,061 --> 00:55:25,455
-Running Man is really fun these days.
-You should come on the show sometime!

727
00:55:25,456 --> 00:55:27,374
<i>Perfect score for his senses!</i>

728
00:55:27,375 --> 00:55:29,937
Purposely saying something else
and pretending not to have seen Soo Hyun

729
00:55:29,937 --> 00:55:31,849
This is the prize...

730
00:55:31,850 --> 00:55:34,779
This is gold...
if you win, this is what you get.

731
00:55:34,780 --> 00:55:38,279
Really?
<i>It sounds good...</i>

732
00:55:39,106 --> 00:55:41,845
-Good luck escaping.
-Yes.  Please come on Running Man.

733
00:55:41,846 --> 00:55:46,037
You're the best!
I'm really enjoying you on your show!

734
00:55:46,038 --> 00:55:47,915
-Don't get caught.
-Yes, sir.

735
00:55:49,225 --> 00:55:52,815
<i>He doesn't reveal Soo Hyun's identity
through to the end</i>

736
00:55:53,267 --> 00:55:57,004
<i>And this is how Soo Hyun
averts crisis once again</i>

737
00:55:57,005 --> 00:56:00,128
<i>Thank you, senior...!</i>

738
00:56:00,602 --> 00:56:05,409
<i>On the other hand, Yoo-ruce Willis is
looking for another bouillon...</i>

739
00:56:09,772 --> 00:56:14,101
<i>He opened the door... But it's blocked?</i>

740
00:56:15,635 --> 00:56:17,062
What is this?

741
00:56:17,063 --> 00:56:18,831
Just what the heck is this?

742
00:56:22,429 --> 00:56:25,027
If Kwang Soo or Gary had been here...

743
00:56:25,028 --> 00:56:30,573
<i>If they had been here, it would have
been great to have seen their expression</i>

744
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:39,072
<i>The truth is,
they're fake doors made for drama shootings</i>

745
00:56:41,825 --> 00:56:45,614
<i>They do say that a giraffe will come
walking in if they're talked about...</i>

746
00:56:47,010 --> 00:56:48,518
Where are you going?

747
00:56:49,001 --> 00:56:50,581
Did you find anything?

748
00:56:53,916 --> 00:56:57,862
<i>Without hesitation,
searching each other's bags</i>

749
00:56:57,863 --> 00:56:59,164
-You really haven't found anything?
-No...

750
00:57:07,188 --> 00:57:10,705
-Jae Suk...
-I was just searching your back...

751
00:57:10,706 --> 00:57:12,703
Why are you looking around like that?

752
00:57:13,221 --> 00:57:15,667
-I'm just searching around.
-That's worse than insulting my parents!

753
00:57:17,099 --> 00:57:18,582
-Jae Suk...
-What... What?

754
00:57:18,583 --> 00:57:20,774
-Your jokes are a little too severe...
-Why?  I was just searching.

755
00:57:20,775 --> 00:57:25,346
The last time... My grandmother just went
into her room during the 100th episode.

756
00:57:26,267 --> 00:57:29,709
All the family were gathered
to watch the show and have dinner...

757
00:57:29,709 --> 00:57:31,612
-I'm sorry.
-And they just went home.

758
00:57:31,612 --> 00:57:33,526
<i>All of Kwang Soo's family were gathered,
but went home when he got ousted</i>

759
00:57:33,526 --> 00:57:34,878
You shouldn't have let me get so close.

760
00:57:34,879 --> 00:57:36,230
You should always be careful of your name tag.

761
00:57:36,781 --> 00:57:38,906
Kwang Soo, come here.

762
00:57:39,848 --> 00:57:41,413
Will you go in there for a moment?

763
00:57:43,577 --> 00:57:46,446
<i>Huh?  The construction is...?</i>

764
00:57:46,447 --> 00:57:48,413
-Welcome!
-You scared me!

765
00:57:48,414 --> 00:57:50,468
-Welcome!
-You scared me!

766
00:57:51,718 --> 00:57:53,239
What is this?

767
00:57:53,240 --> 00:57:56,881
Welcome.  I welcome you to the magic room.

768
00:57:56,882 --> 00:57:59,108
-Welcome...
-What is this?

769
00:58:00,376 --> 00:58:01,578
-Who are you?
-It's magic.

770
00:58:01,579 --> 00:58:03,938
-Where did Jae Suk go?
-Kwang Soo, come here.

771
00:58:04,783 --> 00:58:08,522
<i>Jae Suk having fun at pranking Kwang Soo</i>

772
00:58:08,523 --> 00:58:10,175
What is this?  Is this a dream?

773
00:58:10,176 --> 00:58:11,628
<i>This door...</i>

774
00:58:12,837 --> 00:58:14,565
<i>Working his magic...</i>

775
00:58:14,566 --> 00:58:16,964
<i>...Or pretending to</i>

776
00:58:17,825 --> 00:58:22,898
No matter how you try to open it...
The doors are everywhere...

777
00:58:29,887 --> 00:58:32,923
Who are you?
What did you do with Jae Suk?

778
00:58:32,924 --> 00:58:36,799
Who are you?  Just who are you?
Is this a dream or reality?!

779
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:41,031
<i>These two shooting a short within seconds</i>

780
00:58:41,459 --> 00:58:42,945
Do you finally know?

781
00:58:44,251 --> 00:58:47,428
-Stop!  Please stop!  I'm so dizzy!
-Do you know now?

782
00:58:47,429 --> 00:58:49,411
Do you know where you are now?

783
00:58:50,064 --> 00:58:54,185
The place you are at...
is a place where you can no longer escape.

784
00:58:54,186 --> 00:58:56,651
-You can't escape...
-I have to get out of here!

785
00:58:56,652 --> 00:59:00,245
No matter how you try to escape...
You can't...

786
00:59:00,246 --> 00:59:02,343
<i>Slapstick's new expert, Giraffe Kwang Soo</i>

787
00:59:02,343 --> 00:59:04,244
-No matter where you go...
-I'm going to get out of here!

788
00:59:04,244 --> 00:59:05,783
Try and see if you can escape this place!

789
00:59:07,138 --> 00:59:08,427
What!

790
00:59:09,804 --> 00:59:12,137
Do you finally realize it?

791
00:59:12,137 --> 00:59:14,166
<i>There's...a magic door?</i>

792
00:59:18,203 --> 00:59:20,757
<i>Naive Gary arrives
Go in there.</i>

793
00:59:22,246 --> 00:59:23,907
Slowly, slowly... Open it slowly.

794
00:59:30,073 --> 00:59:33,304
<i>Naive Gary is 100% surprised</i>

795
00:59:33,394 --> 00:59:35,295
Gary, it's a magical room.

796
00:59:36,090 --> 00:59:40,527
<i>The only person that believes
that it's a real magic room</i>

797
00:59:40,528 --> 00:59:42,489
-Did you find something?
-I haven't found anything.

798
00:59:43,778 --> 00:59:46,133
What do you have?
<i>An awkward expression...</i>

799
00:59:47,302 --> 00:59:49,570
-You found something, didn't you?
-What do you mean?  Found what?

800
00:59:49,571 --> 00:59:54,760
<i>Gary's expedient face that betrays him
whenever he lies</i>

801
00:59:54,761 --> 00:59:58,623
<i>Without even seeing it,
it's obvious that Gary's found something</i>

802
01:00:02,432 --> 01:00:04,463
-I didn't...!
-Don't do that.

803
01:00:07,567 --> 01:00:11,113
-Let's at least see what it looks like.
-Just show us what it looks like.

804
01:00:11,114 --> 01:00:14,028
-I really shouldn't be doing that...
-Let us see it just once.

805
01:00:16,672 --> 01:00:18,620
Just show us the back then.

806
01:00:22,049 --> 01:00:24,059
I'll show it to you real quick.

807
01:00:25,438 --> 01:00:27,319
-'So' is written on there.
-'So'?  What's that?

808
01:00:27,320 --> 01:00:29,646
'So's written on there...?
<i>You saw that?</i>

809
01:00:29,647 --> 01:00:32,332
<i>How did he see that?
How did you see that?</i>

810
01:00:32,597 --> 01:00:36,850
<i>On the other hand...</i>

811
01:00:36,851 --> 01:00:40,372
<i>Huh?  Soo Hyun looks frozen in place</i>

812
01:00:40,373 --> 01:00:42,113
Oh!  Hi Jong Kook.

813
01:00:43,504 --> 01:00:48,376
Oh... I'm here because I have a meeting
for a drama today.

814
01:00:49,140 --> 01:00:52,738
<i>Is he meeting with Mr. Capable?</i>

815
01:00:52,739 --> 01:00:56,632
I'm here because I have a meeting
for a drama today.

816
01:00:56,632 --> 01:00:59,212
I'm really enjoying Running Man.

817
01:01:00,487 --> 01:01:01,961
Ah, the water gun?

818
01:01:01,962 --> 01:01:04,225
Well because I'm a fan of Running Man...

819
01:01:05,143 --> 01:01:09,920
<i>Practicing for the moment that
he faces Mr. Capable</i>

820
01:01:09,921 --> 01:01:12,996
Running Man...
I'm seriously a big fan.

821
01:01:13,326 --> 01:01:16,025
So I go around with
a name tag on my clothes too.

822
01:01:18,191 --> 01:01:21,457
When will I be able to come on Running Man?

823
01:01:21,457 --> 01:01:24,189
There's no way this is going to work.

824
01:01:28,725 --> 01:01:30,724
What do I do?

825
01:01:31,501 --> 01:01:36,508
<i>Popular Kim Soo Hyun's weakness revealed...

<i>Blankly staring...</i>

01:01:50,493 --> 01:01:52,380
Jong Kook hasn't seen you yet?

828
01:01:55,837 --> 01:01:57,843
Have you found anything?

829
01:02:00,781 --> 01:02:03,048
How could you do this to me?

830
01:02:04,143 --> 01:02:07,410
-You don't think I heard earlier?
-What did you hear?

831
01:02:07,411 --> 01:02:09,789
-You said I should be eliminated first?

-Listen you.

with a smiling face next time.

840
01:02:28,928 --> 01:02:30,995
I don't know.  Will a day like that come?

841
01:02:31,476 --> 01:02:33,932
Why don't we have a meal together sometime?

842
01:02:33,933 --> 01:02:36,790

Please show me the way.

861
01:04:09,693 --> 01:04:14,280

Jong Kook knows that I came in here.

970

Since he knows I came in here, when I open
the door and he comes in here, rip his tag off.

But since this morning, Kim Soo Hyun...

994
01:15:07,833 --> 01:15:10,505
(A real fan) Soo Hyun, you can stand up.

Soo Hyun, please stay with me.

996
01:15:13,759 --> 01:15:17,562
I just ran in here because I got so scared
when I heard your voice...

997
01:15:17,563 --> 01:15:21,313
And then Soo Hyun scared me by being here
and asked me to help him.

998
01:15:21,314 --> 01:15:24,059
-What I did was wrong...
-Let's go.

999
01:15:24,060 --> 01:15:27,006
Jong Kook!  You know that there's
a dinner outing after we're done, right?

1000
01:15:29,047 --> 01:15:32,731
<i>Kim Jong Kook, out.
Kim Jong Kook, out.</i>

1001
01:15:33,829 --> 01:15:35,610
-Kim Jong Kook, out?
-Kim Jong Kook, out?

1002
01:15:35,611 --> 01:15:37,195
Who ousted him?

1003
01:15:38,088 --> 01:15:40,042
He just said that Kim Jong Kook is out, right?

1004
01:15:40,043 --> 01:15:43,207
<i>The shocking news
of Kim Jong Kook being ousted</i>

1005
01:15:43,208 --> 01:15:45,372
Did HaHa oust him?  He's the only one...

1006
01:15:47,967 --> 01:15:49,442
No way...

1007
01:15:51,246 --> 01:15:55,827
The truth is, we've succeeded.
I've wanted Jong Kook out...

1008
01:15:55,828 --> 01:16:00,427
<i>HaHa and Soo Hyun succeed at
helping each other out for now</i>

1009
01:16:00,428 --> 01:16:03,920
Even though what we all want is to win...

1010
01:16:04,499 --> 01:16:10,515
You should win since you're a guest...

1011
01:16:10,516 --> 01:16:19,373
And I will become your helper,
and as a prize take the turtle's back...

1012
01:16:19,374 --> 01:16:21,020
<i>He wants the turtle's shell as a prize</i>

1013
01:16:21,607 --> 01:16:24,848
<i>This is good since it was too difficult
to do on my own...!</i>

1014
01:16:24,849 --> 01:16:29,117
If you'll keep your promise, we can do this.

1015
01:16:37,650 --> 01:16:40,964
<i>It sounded like HaHa's voice...</i>

1016
01:16:44,163 --> 01:16:47,489
<i>HaHa's unfair trade negotiations</i>

1017
01:16:50,512 --> 01:16:55,453
<i>Huh?  the door's not opening?</i>

1018
01:17:05,046 --> 01:17:07,368
What's this?  Why isn't this opening?

1019
01:17:14,646 --> 01:17:15,864
Jae Suk!

1020
01:17:15,865 --> 01:17:18,196
Why were you doing out there?

1021
01:17:18,197 --> 01:17:21,258
<i>HaHa casually luring
Jae Suk into the room too</i>

1022
01:17:21,259 --> 01:17:23,631
<i>So it's Jae Suk this time...</i>

1023
01:17:23,632 --> 01:17:26,548
-How did you tear his tag off?
-Look at this...

1024
01:17:27,149 --> 01:17:29,992
-How did you oust him?
-What do you mean, how did I oust him?

1025
01:17:30,433 --> 01:17:33,800
<i>Target within range!</i>

1026
01:17:34,073 --> 01:17:36,198
-Do you know what this place is?
-What is this place?

1027
01:17:36,199 --> 01:17:37,840
You're getting a strange vibe, right?

1028
01:17:37,841 --> 01:17:41,021
<i>HaHa targeting Jae Suk first...
Soo Hyun... Soo Hyun!</i>

1029
01:17:41,022 --> 01:17:43,446
<i>The time has come!</i>

1030
01:17:43,616 --> 01:17:46,650
<i>Boss Soo Hyun mobilized!</i>

1031
01:17:46,651 --> 01:17:48,684
Hello.  Hello.

1032
01:17:52,005 --> 01:17:55,323
<i>Totally shocked Yoo-ruce Willis</i>

1033
01:17:55,324 --> 01:17:57,297
What is this?  What is this, HaHa?

1034
01:17:57,298 --> 01:17:58,807
<i>Jae Suk can't even talk from the shock</i>

1035
01:17:58,808 --> 01:18:01,380
Can I pull it off slowly?

1036
01:18:01,381 --> 01:18:03,751
<i>Another successful trade
between HaHa and Soo Hyun</i>

1037
01:18:05,249 --> 01:18:09,143
<i>Soo Hyun succeeds in getting rid of
Jae Suk's name tag!</i>

1038
01:18:09,144 --> 01:18:11,736
-He's been with us all day.
-When?

1039
01:18:11,737 --> 01:18:13,490
He said he's been going around with us all day!

1040
01:18:13,491 --> 01:18:16,138
Ever since you were on the boat in Gimpo.

1041
01:18:16,837 --> 01:18:19,193
-I didn't even know!
-You said you two were close.

1042
01:18:19,194 --> 01:18:21,790
Ah... Soo Hyun...

1043
01:18:24,533 --> 01:18:26,695
He always acts like you guys are close,
and whenever you're on TV,

1044
01:18:26,696 --> 01:18:28,742
he says 'There's Soo Hyun...'

1045
01:18:29,266 --> 01:18:32,128
I think this is the first time I've seen him
since he became a huge star.

1046
01:18:34,238 --> 01:18:36,392
How have you been, Soo Hyun?

1047
01:18:36,393 --> 01:18:40,627
<i>The way you call his name and your behavior
is all awkward, so how are you close?</i>

1048
01:18:40,628 --> 01:18:42,437
Whenever you're on TV,
he acts like you guys are so close!

1049
01:18:42,438 --> 01:18:44,025
I really had thought that you two were close!

1050
01:18:44,026 --> 01:18:46,892
He says stuff like
'Wow... Soo Hyun's really doing well!'

1051
01:18:46,893 --> 01:18:50,024
You have no idea how close we are...!

1052
01:18:50,792 --> 01:18:53,244
I knew something felt a little off today.

1053
01:18:53,245 --> 01:18:57,841
-Right?
-But I had no idea that Soo Hyun would be on.

1054
01:18:57,842 --> 01:18:59,763
<i>But seeing Soo Hyun is a welcome sight</i>

1055
01:18:59,764 --> 01:19:02,326
<i>Anyways, Jae Suk-Out!</i>

1056
01:19:02,695 --> 01:19:05,234
<i>You're really good looking...</i>

1057
01:19:15,219 --> 01:19:20,113
<i>Gold Wan's room where they can find out
whether their gold is real or not</i>

1058
01:19:20,647 --> 01:19:21,898
Here it is.

1059
01:19:23,199 --> 01:19:27,342
<i>Reading Kwang Soo's gold turtle</i>

1060
01:19:27,343 --> 01:19:29,095
Okay, I will let you know.

1061
01:19:29,096 --> 01:19:31,788
Your turtle is...

1062
01:19:32,960 --> 01:19:36,680
<i>Green means real and red means fake</i>

1063
01:19:39,502 --> 01:19:43,927
<i>Kwang Soo's turtle is real gold!</i>

1064
01:19:43,928 --> 01:19:47,091
<i>What luck is this...!</i>

1065
01:19:47,864 --> 01:19:49,265
Thank you...

1066
01:19:54,503 --> 01:19:59,835
<i>Now if I can only figure out the
final destination, I win!</i>

1067
01:20:05,410 --> 01:20:08,190
<i>Searching through as if it's his own</i>

1068
01:20:08,191 --> 01:20:11,008
-Tell me honestly...
-It's fake.

1069
01:20:11,009 --> 01:20:12,440
-What?
-It's a fake.

1070
01:20:13,120 --> 01:20:17,921
<i>The wall of distrust is back up
between the Easy Brothers</i>

1071
01:20:17,922 --> 01:20:19,809
-Yours is real.
-It's a fake.

1072
01:20:19,810 --> 01:20:21,695
Then why are you so territorial over it?

1073
01:20:24,038 --> 01:20:25,263
Look at this.

1074
01:20:25,264 --> 01:20:28,657
The tail on my turtle is bent.

1075
01:20:28,658 --> 01:20:31,115
<i>Suk Jin's turtle with the bent tail</i>

1076
01:20:31,116 --> 01:20:33,902
The tail on yours is still intact.
Yours must be real.

1077
01:20:33,903 --> 01:20:37,205
<i>The difference in shape of the tail
is what separates real from fake?</i>

1078
01:20:37,206 --> 01:20:40,445
-See?  The tail is dead on mine.
-What do you mean, it's dead?

1079
01:20:41,292 --> 01:20:42,598
What are you doing?

1080
01:20:42,599 --> 01:20:44,608
See?  Mine has the tail down right now
because it's fake.

1081
01:20:45,832 --> 01:20:48,051
See?  The tail on yours is still alive!

1082
01:20:50,769 --> 01:20:52,508
If yours is fake, then switch with me.

1083
01:20:52,509 --> 01:20:54,491
-Trade with you?
-Trade with me.

1084
01:20:54,492 --> 01:20:56,433
-If it's fake, then switch with me.
-Let's not switch or things like that.

1085
01:20:56,914 --> 01:21:01,393
<i>It's becoming even more obvious that
it's real from not wanting to trade</i>

1086
01:21:02,673 --> 01:21:05,739
-Yours is real...
-It's a real fake.

1087
01:21:05,740 --> 01:21:09,210
<i>What is the fate of the real gold turtle
that's in Kwang Soo's hands?</i>

1088
01:21:12,101 --> 01:21:17,203
<i>On the other hand, the unfair trade coalition
between HaHa and Soo Hyun...</i>

1089
01:21:20,376 --> 01:21:22,323
<i>Oh!  Soo Hyun disguised as a VJ!</i>

1090
01:21:22,324 --> 01:21:24,973
<i>Soo Hyun is slowly getting more and more
acclimated to the show!</i>

1091
01:21:26,202 --> 01:21:27,444
Ji Hyo!

1092
01:21:29,477 --> 01:21:33,996
<i>In order to eliminate,

1093
01:21:33,997 --> 01:21:37,687
I think they're trying to trick us...
Come here.

1094
01:21:37,688 --> 01:21:39,029
<i>Luring Ji Hyo into a dead end hallway...</i>

1095
01:21:39,746 --> 01:21:42,688
<i>She's passing by!  If she recognizes him...</i>

1096
01:21:42,689 --> 01:21:45,033
<i>She doesn't know!</i>

1097
01:21:45,034 --> 01:21:47,584
Then the Pil-Chok-Cross team is
deceiving everyone right now?

1098
01:21:47,585 --> 01:21:50,671
<i>Venturing even closer</i>

1099
01:21:55,977 --> 01:22:00,929
<i>She's close!  Close enough to touch
with an outstretched hand!</i>

1100
01:22:03,361 --> 01:22:06,428
<i>Ace's instinct!
Putting her back to the wall from a weird vibe</i>

1101
01:22:06,429 --> 01:22:08,465
<i>What a loss...</i>

1102
01:22:08,872 --> 01:22:11,398
-Let's go, let's go...
-Let's get rid of them first.

1103
01:22:11,974 --> 01:22:15,118
-Seriously... Promise me.
-I really promise.  Until they're out...

1104
01:22:18,016 --> 01:22:21,121
-Until it's all over... I promise.
-Really?  You have to promise.

1105
01:22:21,122 --> 01:22:22,527
<i>Again...!</i>

1106
01:22:22,528 --> 01:22:25,284
<i>Fail again with Ji Hyo moving!</i>

<i>If he loses this chance, he may never...</i>

1109
01:22:29,868 --> 01:22:32,041
-Really?
-I seriously promise.

Why can't you tear it off in one shot

1114
01:22:49,687 --> 01:22:52,184
<i>Just then, Ji Hyo's counterattack!</i>

1115

<i>Discovers the Easy Brothers in a fight!</i>

1126

01:23:52,780 --> 01:23:57,752
<i>Easy Brothers ripped away

1128

1129
01:24:00,546 --> 01:24:01,845

Tell me honestly... Your gold is real, right?

1133
01:24:18,226 --> 01:24:19,805
My gold is real.
