-Huh?
-Why are you unarmed?

But you have a family.
You can't be giving her flowers.

860

-I didn't give it to her secretly.
-But it was given to her secretly!

That's allowed.

all the viewers were watching.

-You're asking for trouble!
-That has nothing to do with this!

for a mission?

1013
00:59:19,300 --> 00:59:21,940
You can't die if
you're my true love, Kwang Soo.

1014
00:59:25,970 --> 00:59:29,370

-This one is a total scammer.
-He's a real scammer.

00:59:37,940 --> 00:59:39,660
-Ji Min!
-Yes?

1018
00:59:39,660 --> 00:59:42,500
Be careful going around.
The reason why is...

1019
00:59:42,510 --> 00:59:43,780
The fake ones...

1020
00:59:44,180 --> 00:59:46,750
If they trick you and you get up there,
then you lose.

1021
00:59:47,140 --> 00:59:48,530
Then you'll fail.

1022
00:59:48,830 --> 00:59:50,670
Ji Min, get your head on straight!

1023
00:59:50,770 --> 00:59:52,710
Everyone else other than me are fakes!

1024
00:59:53,260 --> 00:59:54,880
Don't die, Kwang Soo, okay?

1025
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:56,640
But I have a feeling
that you're going to die soon.

1026
00:59:56,650 --> 00:59:57,800
No, I won't, Ji Min.

1027
00:59:59,330 --> 01:00:00,440

[A baseball fan amongst them would definitely
be either Jae Suk or Jae Dong]

[Are they both nervous because the clue
indicates to themselves?]

1040

[How can he argue that he's Ji Min's true love
when he's behaving that way?]

1041

Jae Dong has a really nice form.

1042

See how he's swinging now?
But do you know how he hits on the plate?

'Oops!  I missed that a little'.

1044
01:01:19,410 --> 01:01:22,290
I saw him a while ago when we used to play
on the celebrity baseball league.

1045
01:01:22,870 --> 01:01:25,250
His form was so horrible back then...

1046
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:28,890
This is a total shocker for me right now.

Is it you?

1048
01:01:32,270 --> 01:01:34,820
Don't you know how disappointed
Ji Min's going to be?

[If Shin-Kkuh-Sa was her true love...]

I could not be it either.

I'm pondering if I should oust you or not.

taking a hit, isn't it?

weight is matching up?]

[Kwang Soo matches perfectly to
the weight scale mark!]

[Then does this mean Kwang Soo
is her real true love?]

-It's not Kwang Soo.
-Why?

-What?

1112
01:05:28,640 --> 01:05:31,560
Ji Min, running away right now...

-Just go Kwang Soo... Run!
-I love you!

1114
01:05:34,700 --> 01:05:37,220
-Ji Min!
-How can you be that simple?

1115
01:05:37,230 --> 01:05:38,960
-With just that one clue?  Open the door.
-Ji Min...

1116

-Think about this carefully...
-Don't be so simple.

If by any chance, it's not Kwang Soo...

1118
01:05:45,360 --> 01:05:47,680
-Then Kwang Soo is going to win.
-Kwang Soo wins then.

1119

The name for this escape right now...
Is a lovers' escape!

This feeling right now...!
Don't ever forget it!

1121
01:05:58,770 --> 01:06:00,640
Ji Min... It's not Kwang Soo.

1122
01:06:00,950 --> 01:06:03,080
I don't know...
I haven't found a single clue yet.

1123
01:06:03,080 --> 01:06:05,310
According to the information that
I have gathered...

1124
01:06:05,640 --> 01:06:07,580
You all need to know this.

1125
01:06:07,580 --> 01:06:12,370
It's not Ha Ha, Suk Jin, Kwang Soo or Gary.

1126
01:06:12,370 --> 01:06:14,600
-Why?
-Then is it one of you two?

1127
01:06:15,560 --> 01:06:17,350
Wait a minute...

1128
01:06:17,350 --> 01:06:19,300
-It's not Ji Hyo either.
-No, not Ji Hyo.

1129
01:06:19,310 --> 01:06:21,960
[Ji Hyo's definitely not a suspect either]

1130
01:06:21,960 --> 01:06:27,050
[Then the only suspects remaining would be
Jae Suk, Jong Kook and Jae Dong]

1131
01:06:27,660 --> 01:06:32,330
[The 'J' and baseball that Jae Suk has found
adds to the reasoning]

1132
01:06:32,870 --> 01:06:36,010
[If paying attention to what the weight scale
says, then the interpretation says otherwise]

1133
01:06:36,010 --> 01:06:37,620
Ji Min,
why don't you step outside for a minute?

1134
01:06:38,060 --> 01:06:41,200
-Yeah.  Let us talk this out.
-She needs to stay with us.

1135
01:06:41,490 --> 01:06:45,050
-I'll take Ji Min and stand outside the door.
-Okay. Do that.

1136
01:06:45,050 --> 01:06:47,630
-Let us talk for a bit.
-Your hand when we were running earlier...

1137
01:06:47,630 --> 01:06:50,140
-...it felt really warm.
-You'll remember yesterday, right Ji Min?

1138
01:06:52,020 --> 01:06:53,670
Who do you think it is?

1139
01:06:53,890 --> 01:06:57,900
I...did think that it was Jae Dong...

1140
01:06:58,380 --> 01:07:02,500
But Kwang Soo matched
the weight marker so perfectly...!

1141
01:07:02,500 --> 01:07:04,600
But the fact that it
matches so perfectly is weird.

1142
01:07:04,600 --> 01:07:07,290
-Just think about it.
-Is that what you think?

1143
01:07:08,770 --> 01:07:10,940
Do you still think that it's Gary?

1144
01:07:10,940 --> 01:07:12,830
I think it's Gary.

1145
01:07:13,110 --> 01:07:17,480
I'm thinking about you
and helping you find your true love.

1146

[Getting even more confusing with
each hint that they find...]

please raise their hands.

1148
01:07:24,030 --> 01:07:26,140
-The ones who aren't?
-No, the ones who are.

1149
01:07:27,770 --> 01:07:30,820
-He's really being shameless.
-I'm the real one.

[An outcry from all the young men]

01:07:35,910 --> 01:07:38,860
I'm sorry to interrupt your conversation...
But have you seen Han Ji Min?

01:07:38,860 --> 01:07:40,550
-We saw her.
-Where is she?

1153
01:07:40,980 --> 01:07:44,430
Jae Dong...also is a possibility.

1154
01:07:44,430 --> 01:07:46,030
-Really?
-I could be the one. Where is she?

1155
01:07:46,030 --> 01:07:48,670
The possibility is there according
to the information that I've gathered.

1156
01:07:48,670 --> 01:07:51,500
-Where is Ji Min?
-No, he can't be the one.

1157
01:07:51,500 --> 01:07:53,230
-Let me just say this.
-He can't be the one.

1158
01:07:53,230 --> 01:07:55,960
'J'... There's a 'J' in the name.

1159
01:07:55,960 --> 01:07:57,720
'J'?  What about Ji Suk Jin?

1160
01:07:57,720 --> 01:08:02,030
[Jong Kook-Jae Dong-Jae Suk-Suk Jin]

1161

Jae Suk... My name is actually Jelly.

1162
01:08:04,870 --> 01:08:06,780
-It's not Gary, but Jelly?
-My real name is Jelly.

1163
01:08:06,780 --> 01:08:08,750
My name is Ja Ja.

1164
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:13,140
And my name is Jang Soo!

1165
01:08:15,320 --> 01:08:16,530
Think about something else.

1166
01:08:16,530 --> 01:08:19,470
-Jong Kook...
-It was fine up to Jelly and Ja Ja...

1167
01:08:19,470 --> 01:08:21,110
Then my name is Kwang Joo.

1168
01:08:22,500 --> 01:08:24,190
Think about it one more time.

1169
01:08:24,670 --> 01:08:28,250
Can I say one thing before I go since you
guys dismissed me so harshly?

1170
01:08:28,610 --> 01:08:30,480
-Is Jae Suk up there?
-Yeah.

1171
01:08:31,580 --> 01:08:34,490
In my opinion,
there's a 90% chance that it's Jae Suk.

1172
01:08:34,490 --> 01:08:36,680
-Why?  Why do you think that?
-According to the clue I found.

The truth is... Whether it's you or not,
we have to oust you.

-Why?
-We have to take out the competition.

1340

-But so suddenly like this?
-No matter, we have to rid the competition.

1341

You don't think I had any
opportunity to oust you?

1342

1351
01:19:39,560 --> 01:19:40,590

01:20:54,970 --> 01:20:58,530
Duet!  Yeah... He's a duet
because he and I MC'd together.

1370
01:21:02,410 --> 01:21:03,890
It definitely wasn't Kwang Soo!

-It's really not Jae Dong.
-Let's oust him right now.

1374
01:21:17,410 --> 01:21:19,970
Jae Dong knows it too.
See?  He's running away right now.

1375

-What is this?
-Is something back there?

1381

-Why?

[Listening to what he has to say...
It really was Jae Dong...!]

-Jong Kook!  That really wasn't right!
-Jae Dong... Then I really apologize!

1388

-You're apologizing now?
-I really am sorry.

What do I do now?

1390
01:22:14,100 --> 01:22:18,260
We'll go stand out there now,
and you can decide.

1391
01:22:18,260 --> 01:22:20,070
We've decided to concede.

[How long has this been...?]

1396

there will be a water shower.</i>

1399

1400
01:22:44,380 --> 01:22:47,190
[Just whose hand will Ji Min grab?]

1401
01:22:47,190 --> 01:22:48,650
I think I know.

1402
01:22:48,650 --> 01:22:50,620
Please grab a hand and stand up there.

1403
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:53,180

-It's me, right?
-Hey!  I'm Kang Hee Jin!

1410
01:23:23,140 --> 01:23:26,490
And I was in a duet...
And good at baseball...

1411
01:23:26,490 --> 01:23:29,860
-Kang Hee Jin, just come here.
-Okay, I'm coming.

1412
01:23:29,860 --> 01:23:31,210
It's not me!

1413
01:23:32,580 --> 01:23:34,970
The two of you have gotten really close
again here on Jeju Island.

1414
01:23:34,970 --> 01:23:36,210
Seriously...

1415
01:23:36,210 --> 01:23:38,990
Did you do all this because you
redeveloped your feelings for me again?

1416
01:23:41,280 --> 01:23:45,410
My position was actually very difficult
because I'm a girl...

1417
01:23:45,570 --> 01:23:49,500
I actually thought about...

1418
01:23:49,500 --> 01:23:54,530
Who the real one would be,
and went to bat for him.

1419
01:23:54,530 --> 01:23:58,160
[Just a means for batting for someone?]

1420
01:23:58,160 --> 01:23:59,980
Then you didn't believe in me?!

1421
01:24:00,070 --> 01:24:02,270
You were just trying to win it for yourself?!

1422
01:24:02,720 --> 01:24:04,740
I really thought it was weird myself...

1423
01:24:04,740 --> 01:24:06,340
-Song Ji...
-Gary, seriously...

1424
01:24:06,340 --> 01:24:09,720
This was the first time you've talked to me
so much while we've filmed Running Man.

[A day full of conversing with Gary]

1426
01:24:12,260 --> 01:24:14,220

showered on.

Right now... Ji Min is getting ready
to get soaked to the bone.

01:24:26,360 --> 01:24:30,830
[Right now, Ji Min's belief in Jong Kook
that she's stepped up with is...?]

1431

-Who is the person that you thought it was?
-Jae Dong.

1432
01:24:35,340 --> 01:24:38,770
-Jae Dong.
-You thought it was him from the final clue?

1433
01:24:38,770 --> 01:24:41,970
-You thought it was Jae Dong?
-I thought all along that it may be him...

1434
01:24:41,970 --> 01:24:44,540
-He's crying right now.
-I just wanted to confirm it.

1435

Let's get started!

1436
01:24:46,510 --> 01:24:47,660
Are you ready?

handed to me on the back this morning...]

[Who was the one that was
behind those umbrellas?]

1442
01:25:25,300 --> 01:25:27,830
Those flowers were totally your style.

1443
01:25:27,830 --> 01:25:30,300
Yellow and red...

1444
01:25:31,260 --> 01:25:33,840
-It was really yellow and red...
-What?

-Did you like the flowers?
-Yes.

[The bashful conversations...
Concerned gazes...]

1452
01:26:15,440 --> 01:26:17,700
Why is it like this?

1453
01:26:17,700 --> 01:26:22,170
They have put the people who has
deepest relationship with Running Man on here.

1454
01:26:22,520 --> 01:26:24,350
Ah... I'm so confused right now.

1455
01:26:24,350 --> 01:26:26,350
Then did you really think that
it wasn't me all this time?
