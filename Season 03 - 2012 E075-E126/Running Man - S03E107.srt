00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:48,070
-Where is the car?
-I've been waiting a long time for you.

173
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:49,850
-Where's the car? Where?
-This way.

174
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:53,240
-That's it? How could this have happened?
-Yes, that's it.

175
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:56,540
-It is the one!
-What?

176
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:01,540
This is seriously...

177
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:06,350
As soon as I received this, I thought that
I should call another member who may

178
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:08,970
have the car, and that's why I called you.

179
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:11,990
-So you just called me on chance?
-Just load this box in there for now.

180
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,340
Load up the box in the car.

181
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:17,390
My phone's ringing. Yeah, Jong Kook.

182
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:20,380
-What's going on?
-Hello, Jong Kook! I have missed you!

183
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:22,690
-I love you, Jong Kook!
-Kwang Soo...

184
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:25,980
-I think you're supposed to come pick us up.
-You think that's what it is?

185
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:29,640
I think you're right...
I think I'm supposed to come get you all.

186
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:34,790
So call everyone and get their location,
and figure out where they all are.

187
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:36,400
Jae Suk, it's too hot in here.

188
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:39,340
-And then I'll come pick you all up.
-Make sure you bring Kwang Soo!

189
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:42,480
-Okay, I got it. He's in the seat next to me.
-Okay, I got it.

190
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,300
I got it. Let's get in for now.
We're going to get on the way.

191
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:49,230
Hey... I think everyone has something then.

192
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:52,300
I told you that from the beginning...
Do you still not know Jong Kook?

193
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:55,230
Whatever! You still don't know
this game itself!

194
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:58,330
-I'm seriously about to go crazy...
-You don't know this game itself!

195
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,180
-This is so frustrating.
-This is it...this is it.

196
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:02,090
Miss Blank!

197
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,870
<i>Ji Hyo!</i>

198
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:08,250
What did you get?

199
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:11,390
-Miss Blank...
-Why is the tape still on yours?

200
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:14,710
What I have is...a navigation system.

201
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:16,720
-I think it's to put up here in the car.
-I think so.

202
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,210
-It was difficult finding this place.
-Okay.

203
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:23,760
The really important thing is to find out
where the destination is...

204
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,240
-But you're the one who knows that.
-There's a destination in here, Jae Suk.

205
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,290
-What are you saying?
-Someone else has the destination.

206
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:32,960
I'm seriously about to go crazy...
Who would have it?

207
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,990
No one is even telling us what they have.

208
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:40,180
-There's someone who I think may have it.
-Who is it?

209
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,640
-A friend of mine came today.
-Really?

210
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:45,020
[Blank Ji's friend?]
A guy...

211
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:46,220
A guy...

212
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:50,550
[A total disappointment?]

213
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:53,790
He has the information regarding
our destination on him.

214
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,180
[By any chance...this friend?]

215
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:58,600
Even though I don't know
who your guy friend is...

216
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:02,980
But if he gets here...
we have to ride together with him, right?

217
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:04,150
Of course.

218
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:06,730
It's a pretty tight squeeze in this car...

219
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:09,750
-Okay, then you can get off.
-Ji Hyo...

220
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:13,390
[Why is he adjusting the volume in the car?]

221
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:18,540
Did you just...turn down the volume here
while trying to adjust the volume on that?

222
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:21,780
Why would you turn this down?
This is the audio volume!

223
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:23,750
You should be turning the volume down
from that unit itself.

224
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:25,880
-How do you work this thing?
-How is it that you...

225
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:28,710
Seriously... I'm seriously about to go crazy!

226
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:33,540
-What are you doing right now?
-Don't you know how to use the GPS system?

227
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:37,070
Just attach it to your face, why don't you?

228
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:40,350
-What are you doing?
-Just stick it on there...

229
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:43,120
Hey, Kwang Soo...

230
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,330
Put that thing up here and give Ha Ha a call.

231
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:47,790
Why are you putting it up there?

232
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:51,320
Jae Suk's the one driving,
and he needs to be able to see it, you dummy!

233
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,880
But there was no need to call him a dummy...

234
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:57,480
You should scold her!
Don't you think that you're being too harsh?

235
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,560
That much is just a term of affection.

236
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:01,960
Hey, don't you know how to work
a navigation system?

237
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:06,360
-Give me some room to breathe here!
-Hurry up and give Ha Ha a call.

238
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,950
-Check and see what's going on with him.
-What are you telling me to do now?

239
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:12,100
[The endless nagging
from his older brother and sister]

240
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:17,390
[The chasing team also gets in their car]

241
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:24,720
-This is my first time seeing you drive.
-Seriously...no kidding.

242
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:28,680
After keeping them all dazed for a while...

243
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:34,060
Then we'll catch the one
who has the gold badge, right?

244
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,400
That's pretty hard.

245
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:40,280
I feel like I'm the one who's going to
get confused in the process.

246
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:42,670
Even though it sounds simple...

247
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:46,570
In the drama, we're a formidable brain power...

248
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:53,360
First, out of all the members...
the gold medalist for betrayal is Kwang Soo.

249
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:59,540
And the member who is most loyal...

250
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,550
-Is Jae Suk?
-Kim Jong Kook?

251
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:04,410
And Jong Kook.

252
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:06,860
Ji Hyo is the Ace...

253
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:11,440
What is Ji Suk Jin?
Is he in Kwang Soo's league?

254
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:14,400
I think he kind of goes back and forth.

255
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,060
[Big-nosed brother changing his course
depending on the situation]

256
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:21,540
[Huh?
The chase team arrives at some location]

257
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:27,570
[It seems as though the Running Man
team may be heading this way]

258
00:17:28,770 --> 00:17:29,810
Shin Young...

259
00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:31,530
Let me check the water in your water gun.

260
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:33,650
-There's water in it.
-Try shooting it.

261
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:41,480
[On the other hand,
Ha Ha is waiting for his ride]

262
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,320
-Hello, Ha Ha!
-Hey...

263
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:50,260
Hey, Dog-nose is here.

264
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:52,900
Hey...what the heck are you wearing?

265
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:56,760
What is it that you have, Ha Ha?

266
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:59,910
-Let's see it.
-I told you...I have the USB.

267
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:02,340
Why do you look so angry?

268
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:05,670
Hello, Jong Kook!

269
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:12,760
[And lastly, arriving at where Impala awaits]

270
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:19,070
-Sorry for making you wait.
-What is it all that you have?

271
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,530
I bought some stuff to eat.

272
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:23,470
Suk Jin has money...
Ha Ha, let me see the USB that you have.

273
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:25,260
[Dog-nose has the name tags,
Jong Kook - team shirts,]

274
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:28,550
-Here's the USB.
-What is the mission?

275
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,570
Who has the mission?

276
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:35,180
<i>Running Man members...
It's nice to meet you all.</i>

277
00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:40,260
[Huh? Kim Sang Joong!]

278
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:44,030
-Can you turn it up?
-It's Sang Joong.

279
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:47,320
There's something that you all
need to do for me today.

280
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:50,130
And that is to find the gold badge.

281
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:56,370
First, go to M-used sales lot in Incheon

282
00:18:56,370 --> 00:18:58,220
and find the black box.

283
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:01,650
If you can't find
the black box within an hour...

284
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:05,170
The black box is going to self-destruct.

285
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:08,810
Then now...

286
00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:12,150
To make this Running Man enjoyable
as the water floating down in a river...

287
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:15,400
I hope that you come running along with me.

288
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:18,230
He tries too hard to act cool.

289
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:25,820
[Incheon M-used car sales lot]

290
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:28,310

-How do we find the black box in here?</i>

[Running Man members
arriving at the upper floor]

292
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:36,450
-We have to find it within an hour!
-The person that finds it has to yell it out.

293
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:40,190
[They have to find the black box within
an hour like Sang Joong told them...]

294

<i>If you don't find
the black box within an hour...</i>

hidden in here within an hour!]

-It's not here...where could it be?</i>

00:19:56,490 --> 00:20:01,110
[So many various car lining up each level
without even a space in between]

299

[It has to be a car that all
7 of them can fit into?]

300

Let's go down. You guys go up a floor,
and I'll go down a floor.

301

[Deciding to scatter to find the box
within the allotted hour]

302

How am I to find it in here?
-What does a black box look like?

303
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:15,880
What does a black box look like?

304

-Don't you think this is it?
-You get the feeling too?

305
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:22,980
-We can open the cars.
-Aren't we finding it too soon and too easily?

306

[Huh? The door's locked?]

307
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:31,050
It's locked up.

308

I can't open the door.

309
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:38,870
[Does this situation mean that each
and every car needs to be checked?]

310

[Just then]

that are left unlocked]

-This isn't where he is!
-Where the heck is Suk Jin?

824
00:51:39,710 --> 00:51:41,140
What is this?

825
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,210
Hey!

826
00:51:44,380 --> 00:51:46,950
[Running Man members being frightened
to the point of their hair turning gray]

827
00:51:46,950 --> 00:51:49,910
-Run!
-We have to escape!

828
00:51:49,910 --> 00:51:51,570
[They've met their ultimate chaser today!]

829
00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:54,490
<i>I'm being set free, right?</i>

830
00:51:54,490 --> 00:51:58,790
<i>The fate of the hostage who's left alive
will be decided by the two chasers.</i>

831
00:51:58,790 --> 00:52:00,510
What about me?

832
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:03,350
<i>A jail has been prepared.</i>

833
00:52:04,250 --> 00:52:05,810
You have a jail prepared?

834
00:52:08,450 --> 00:52:12,100
[His rationality that can't be
controlled again today...]

835
00:52:12,750 --> 00:52:15,980
-Wait...I'm really out?
-Kwang Soo...

836
00:52:15,980 --> 00:52:18,970
Wait...
I've done everything that you told me to!

837
00:52:18,970 --> 00:52:21,100
Wait...seriously?

838
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:24,880
I told you earlier, didn't I?
Not to trust anyone.

839
00:52:26,220 --> 00:52:29,260
-Huh?
-But before we set you free...

840
00:52:29,550 --> 00:52:32,070
-We have to check you.
-Me?

841
00:52:32,070 --> 00:52:36,220
We have to check you first.
I'm sorry. Just a moment.

842
00:52:36,220 --> 00:52:38,950
I don't have anything.
Why are you taking my shoe off?

843
00:52:38,950 --> 00:52:40,220
I'm sorry.

844
00:52:40,870 --> 00:52:44,090
[Checking thoroughly in case Suk Jin has it]

845
00:52:44,090 --> 00:52:46,310
That's just a tissue. I don't have anything.

846
00:52:51,890 --> 00:52:53,670
Am I going to jail?

847
00:52:53,670 --> 00:52:57,830
-Am I seriously going to jail?
-Bye...

848
00:52:57,830 --> 00:53:01,480
-Really? Am I seriously ousted like this?
-Thanks for all your hard work.

849
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:06,690
[Ah...my life isn't going very well today...]

850
00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:11,830
<i>Ji Hyo...</i>

851
00:53:11,830 --> 00:53:14,580
<i>Ji Hyo...what am I going to do now?</i>

852
00:53:14,590 --> 00:53:17,150
-Suk Jin was the wrong decision!
-Be quiet.

853
00:53:20,140 --> 00:53:24,050
[No one is sympathizing with
the traitorous Giraffe]

854
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:29,060
[Big-nosed brother, who managed to survive,
is being released as he was promised]

855
00:53:29,060 --> 00:53:30,240
Fighting!

856
00:53:32,180 --> 00:53:35,380
[Is he really the one who was given
the vital information?]

857
00:53:35,380 --> 00:53:40,450
[Or the spy to throw
the Running Man members into chaos?]

858
00:53:40,450 --> 00:53:46,530
Then...as of now...it wasn't on Kwang Soo,
and Suk Jin didn't have it either...

859
00:53:46,530 --> 00:53:49,240
Then it means that
one of the other five members has it.

860
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:53,460
For now, I don't think there's any need
for us to go chasing them ourselves.

861
00:53:53,460 --> 00:53:57,160
Just quietly keep watch,
and when we're needed, then...

862
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:02,940
[On the other hand...]

863
00:54:03,650 --> 00:54:06,520
-Hey...
-I think we need to meet up with Suk Jin.

864
00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:10,890
Let's use our brains a little.
I think there's something going on here.

865
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:13,570
Don't you think we should be using our brains
as we make our way around here?

866
00:54:14,140 --> 00:54:16,080
First, we need you to take out
all the bodyguards, Jong Kook.

867
00:54:16,810 --> 00:54:20,850
[The fact that he can
probably do that is the real problem!]

868
00:54:20,850 --> 00:54:22,410
Since there's supposedly
vital information out there

869
00:54:22,410 --> 00:54:24,830
I don't think we can just find the badge
by just walking around searching for it.

870
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:32,590
[Top priority is to meet up with Suk Jin, whom
they believe to have heard the vital info!]

871
00:54:32,590 --> 00:54:34,370
We have to find out
what information he has first.

872
00:54:34,370 --> 00:54:37,730
But he can help us find the gold badge,
or he can help them catch us too.

873
00:54:38,220 --> 00:54:41,450
[Oh...sharp intellect]

874
00:54:42,890 --> 00:54:45,920
[With the growth of his head size,
his intelligence also grew?]

875
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:48,080
In any case, we need to meet up with Suk Jin.

876
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:53,870
I'm sorry.

877
00:54:55,750 --> 00:54:58,630
Just why is it...
that whenever we come to a university...

878
00:55:00,250 --> 00:55:05,990
We have to be chased around by guards...
and run away from them like criminals?

879
00:55:07,530 --> 00:55:09,660
<i>Yoo Jae Suk-2nd floor!
Yoo Jae Suk-2nd floor!</i>

880
00:55:12,830 --> 00:55:15,140
[All over the place...]

881
00:55:15,150 --> 00:55:20,720
[The bodyguards are everywhere!]

882
00:55:23,980 --> 00:55:27,970
[The pressure of the bodyguards closing in
without a chance to catch his breath!]

883
00:55:29,210 --> 00:55:31,230
This is like a sauna in here!

884
00:55:33,470 --> 00:55:36,060
Just what the heck is this?
What is this?

885
00:55:36,610 --> 00:55:38,080
Why are there so many bodyguards?

886
00:55:38,330 --> 00:55:40,880
I thought I was in an Olympic race earlier.

887
00:55:49,820 --> 00:55:51,710
Hey!

888
00:55:52,630 --> 00:55:54,540
Suk Jin! What's going on?

889
00:55:54,540 --> 00:55:57,930
Let's all go downstairs and talk
since we've all gathered together now.

890
00:55:57,930 --> 00:55:59,790
I'll tell you the information.

891
00:56:01,850 --> 00:56:06,660
[He really is sounding like he heard a vital
piece of information from Sang Joong...]

892
00:56:07,510 --> 00:56:10,770
The genuine piece of
information that I was told...

893
00:56:10,770 --> 00:56:13,270
-We're all searching for the gold badge now...
-That's right...

894
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:16,440
-Where is it?
-One of our members has it.

895
00:56:18,530 --> 00:56:25,310
[The gold badge that we're searching for...
One of our members has it?]

896
00:56:26,690 --> 00:56:29,410
[This morning]

897
00:56:34,550 --> 00:56:37,720
[Sang Joong, who received a delivery of
a water gun instead of a gold badge...]

898
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:40,460
<i>I think someone has switched out the packages.</i>

899
00:56:40,460 --> 00:56:47,450
[They realized that a delivery was mistakenly
made to one of the Running Man members]

900
00:56:47,790 --> 00:56:50,130
-You've got a delivery.
-What is this?

901
00:56:50,130 --> 00:56:53,070
[Boxes that were delivered at the same time
too all the Running Man members!]

902
00:56:54,410 --> 00:56:58,020
[Out of those...]

903
00:56:58,030 --> 00:57:03,300
[Inside one of the boxes...]

904
00:57:03,310 --> 00:57:06,780
[Was a gold badge!]

905
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:13,460
[The person that
the gold badge was delivered to is...]

906
00:57:13,460 --> 00:57:16,580
[Jae Suk!]

907
00:57:16,580 --> 00:57:19,960
[It was Yoo-ruce Willis!]

908
00:57:21,630 --> 00:57:23,980
Kwon Yeol...take this with you.

909
00:57:23,980 --> 00:57:25,800
[At the time, he didn't know what it was,
so he gave it to his VJ to carry around]

910
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:27,730
But what could I do?
I can't carry that around with me.

911
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:32,150
Even though I'm happy that
you got yourself a girlfriend,

912
00:57:32,150 --> 00:57:34,140
don't you think that you've changed
too much since you got a girlfriend?

913
00:57:34,140 --> 00:57:36,930
[Thinking that it wasn't anything special,
it was cast aside as something insignificant]

914
00:57:38,220 --> 00:57:45,180
And that is to find a gold badge.
[The gold badge I have is the mission?]

915
00:57:45,190 --> 00:57:47,500
[Because of that he was being cautious
and careful to even breathe all day...]

916
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:49,210
You're keeping it safe, right?

917
00:57:49,860 --> 00:57:51,760
You can't be caught with it, okay?

918
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:54,930
[I'm in big trouble!]

919
00:58:01,810 --> 00:58:06,190
[So the vital information
was that one of us had the badge...]

920
00:58:06,750 --> 00:58:09,270
Anyone could have it.

921
00:58:09,270 --> 00:58:13,100
[If anyone finds out that I have it, I'm dead]

922
00:58:13,100 --> 00:58:16,790
But if it's a lie...

923
00:58:18,550 --> 00:58:21,940
-Why would I lie to you guys?
-It could be Kwang Soo too though.

924
00:58:21,940 --> 00:58:23,590
Kwang Soo could have it too though.

925
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:26,400
[I just want to get out of here...]
Sang Joong is heading this way!

926
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:29,290
-We should go!
-He's coming, he's coming.

927
00:58:29,290 --> 00:58:30,920
[Just then, Sang Joong and Shin Young
are headed their way.]

928
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:36,560
[Jae Suk taking this opportunity to escape!]

929
00:58:42,180 --> 00:58:45,100
[Now he has to hide the gold badge
even more securely]

930
00:58:45,100 --> 00:58:46,630
I don't have any pockets.

931
00:58:47,310 --> 00:58:51,860
[Whether it be a chaser, or a Running Man,
if I'm found out, I'm going to be targeted!]

932
00:58:52,610 --> 00:58:54,330
Here, here...

933
00:58:54,330 --> 00:58:56,150
I have it here.

934
00:58:56,150 --> 00:58:59,810
[Totally hidden inside the mike belt!]

935
00:59:03,960 --> 00:59:06,270
Seriously...what do I do about this?

936
00:59:07,230 --> 00:59:09,010
What am I supposed to do?

937
00:59:09,530 --> 00:59:11,370
-What is it that you have right now?
-A gold badge.

938
00:59:11,370 --> 00:59:12,950
<i>Keep it safe.</i>

939
00:59:15,350 --> 00:59:18,720
What happens when I get ousted then?
Does the badge go to that other person?

940
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:22,880
[If Jae Suk is to get ousted, the gold badge
goes to the person that ousts him]

941
00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:28,780
[Yoo-ruce Willis...
His lonely battle is starting again]

942
00:59:40,870 --> 00:59:42,240
What the heck?

943
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:46,460
[The final location.
Press conference for Running Man winner]

944
00:59:46,910 --> 00:59:49,330
[Ah...]

945
00:59:49,330 --> 00:59:53,400
[The final destination that the chasers
will be going with the gold badge...]

946
00:59:53,410 --> 00:59:57,540
[...is this place!]

947
00:59:59,480 --> 01:00:04,980
[If I can protect the gold badge and last
until the press conference, then I win.]

948
01:00:10,110 --> 01:00:13,710
What are you doing standing there?
You have to hide right now!

949
01:00:13,710 --> 01:00:15,150
Kwon Yeol!

950
01:00:15,150 --> 01:00:18,700
-How many years have we been together?
-I'm really nervous right now.

951
01:00:18,700 --> 01:00:21,100
Be quiet! You have to be more quiet!

952
01:00:21,100 --> 01:00:25,120
[Jae Suk and his VJ are both
being especially nervous today!]

953
01:00:25,120 --> 01:00:27,570
I'm not holding onto this
because I want this thing right now!

954
01:00:29,270 --> 01:00:33,710
[Jae Suk escaping for now so that
he's not detected by anyone]

955
01:00:42,140 --> 01:00:45,770
[Someone is outside the glass doors...]

956
01:00:45,770 --> 01:00:48,230
[The chasers Sang Joong and Shin Young!]

957
01:00:51,720 --> 01:00:52,770
Jae Suk...

958
01:00:52,770 --> 01:00:54,810
It's been so long since I've seen you,
so why are you running away like this?

959
01:00:55,720 --> 01:00:59,340
-I have to run away from you!
-But let's talk for a minute.

960
01:00:59,340 --> 01:01:02,300
[If he is to get ousted by them, then
the badge will fall right into their hands!]

961
01:01:02,300 --> 01:01:04,110
Let's talk later...later.

962
01:01:04,110 --> 01:01:07,530
-Hi Shin Young.
-Hello!

963
01:01:07,530 --> 01:01:09,370
-Jae Suk...
-Sang Joong...

964
01:01:09,370 --> 01:01:11,830
-Have you eaten?
-Yes, I've eaten.

965
01:01:12,610 --> 01:01:16,110
Sang Joong...
You're the villain right now, aren't you?

966
01:01:16,110 --> 01:01:18,940
No, I'm not. I told you earlier...

967
01:01:18,940 --> 01:01:22,860
That I would give a very vital
piece of information to the two of them.

968
01:01:22,870 --> 01:01:25,180
-Why are you holding onto that water gun?
-This?

969
01:01:25,180 --> 01:01:26,960
[Discovers the water gun
that Shin Young is holding]

970
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:29,830
She has it since she's a girl...

971
01:01:29,830 --> 01:01:33,380
But...you have to keep this in mind.
You can't think of me as the villain.

972
01:01:33,670 --> 01:01:37,210
-I told you... Ji Suk Jin...
-No, Sang Joong!

973
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:42,960
-You're the villain, right? You're a villain!
-Whether I'm the villain or not...

974
01:01:47,810 --> 01:01:49,230
<i>Yoo Jae Suk's on the 2nd floor!</i>

975
01:01:52,130 --> 01:01:58,400
[Soon...we'll meet again, Jae Suk]

976
01:01:59,480 --> 01:02:02,400
[I survived...]
Jae Suk!

977
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:05,070
-Did you find something?
-You scared me. I thought you were...

978
01:02:05,070 --> 01:02:06,880
-Aren't those bodyguards behind you?
-Huh?

979
01:02:07,660 --> 01:02:10,610
<i>Yoo Jae Suk, Song Ji Hyo!
Yoo Jae Suk, Song Ji Hyo!</i>

980
01:02:13,470 --> 01:02:16,600
[Shutting the door in his face]

981
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:18,480
That Song Ji Hyo!

982
01:02:24,800 --> 01:02:27,690
[Fully discharged]

983
01:02:27,690 --> 01:02:30,870
What the heck is this today?
What is it that you're trying to do?

984
01:02:31,740 --> 01:02:33,230

the gold badge to the end?]

hear the information that Suk Jin has...]

988
01:02:48,020 --> 01:02:49,380
Ji Hyo, are you out?

989
01:02:49,380 --> 01:02:50,830
No, of course not.

990
01:02:50,830 --> 01:02:53,560
I came to talk to you.

991
01:02:54,450 --> 01:02:57,620
Hey...what did you hear earlier?

992
01:02:58,850 --> 01:03:01,560
Do you think that I'll tell you that now?

993
01:03:01,950 --> 01:03:03,570
Really?
If you're not going to, then I'll leave.

994
01:03:03,570 --> 01:03:06,370
Don't go, don't go!
Stay a little bit longer and talk to me!

995
01:03:08,610 --> 01:03:10,770
What did you talk about?
What was it about?

996
01:03:12,790 --> 01:03:15,860
-Don't try to think of another scheme...
-No, I'm really not trying to do that.

997
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:20,750
Don't think and just tell me!

998
01:03:21,640 --> 01:03:25,390
Right now...you have to oust Jong Kook.

999
01:03:27,070 --> 01:03:28,280
Ji Hyo...

1000
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:30,480
I heard we have a spy today.

1001
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:32,160
There's a spy?

1002
01:03:34,060 --> 01:03:35,660
It's not me! It really isn't me!

1003
01:03:35,660 --> 01:03:38,640
You said one of us is the spy?
Then Suk Jin is the spy!

1004
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:42,170
I don't think they'd make you the spy.
You failed at being the spy the last time.

1005
01:03:42,170 --> 01:03:44,050
Has Suk Jin ever succeeded in it himself?

1006
01:03:44,540 --> 01:03:48,150
-If one of us is the spy...
-Suk Jin is the spy?

1007
01:03:48,150 --> 01:03:51,110
-I'm not the spy.
-I know that you're not the spy.

1008
01:03:51,580 --> 01:03:55,030
Even if you were the spy, it doesn't matter
since you can't do anything.

1009

What's going on? What's the mission?
What's going on out there?

1010

-I really don't know.
-You just sit here and think about it.

1011
01:04:03,050 --> 01:04:04,930
Ji Hyo, can you come back again later?

1012
01:04:04,930 --> 01:04:06,470
-Why?
-Come by again later.

1013
01:04:06,840 --> 01:04:09,510
In case I can get on the air...

1014
01:04:10,430 --> 01:04:13,500
-Can you send someone in here? Anyone?
-Okay.

1015
01:04:13,500 --> 01:04:16,200

just stop in here for a moment.

-Hello, Sang Joong.
-Hi, Ji Hyo.

1020
01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:38,650
Shall we shake hands?

1021
01:04:38,650 --> 01:04:42,200
I'll shake your hand next time.

1022
01:04:42,200 --> 01:04:44,820
-Ji Hyo, but...
-Yes?

1023
01:04:44,830 --> 01:04:47,770
-Have you seen Suk Jin?
-I haven't seen him yet.

1024

-You haven't seen him yet?
-You haven't spoken to him yet?

1025

I haven't seen him yet.

1026
01:04:52,780 --> 01:04:57,310
-You're not by any chance trying to kill me?
-No, we're not trying to kill you.

1027
01:04:57,310 --> 01:05:00,000
Shin Young's gun
is very threatening right now.

1028
01:05:03,570 --> 01:05:05,810
-Nice to see you.
-Yes, it's nice to meet you.

-Ace...

-The mission I gave this morning was...
-To find the gold badge.

1031
01:05:14,580 --> 01:05:17,750
The important thing is to search
for the gold badge together...

1032
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:21,380
-We can search for it together?
-Of course...

1033
01:05:22,780 --> 01:05:28,340
Then for now...why don't we join forces
and go search around together...

1034
01:05:28,340 --> 01:05:30,580
-Then we'll see you later.
-Thank you.

-It was nice to meet you.
-Okay, Ji Hyo.

You want me to stand guard for you?

1037

-I understand.

1046

1300
01:22:32,030 --> 01:22:34,240
-Why are you suddenly talking like that?
-Isn't that right though?

1301
01:22:34,640 --> 01:22:37,280
-I don't think it's him.
-I know it's not you.

1302
01:22:37,280 --> 01:22:39,670
No, I'm not! Hurry up and grab him!

1303
01:22:39,680 --> 01:22:42,570
-No! Hurry up and grab him!
-It may not be me either!

1304
01:22:42,570 --> 01:22:45,970
-Grab him! Grab him!
-Listen to me!

1305
01:22:45,970 --> 01:22:48,610
-Wait. Listen to me carefully.
-What? What?

1306
01:22:48,610 --> 01:22:51,430
-What is it?
-If by any chance, I don't have the badge...

1307
01:22:51,850 --> 01:22:53,610
-Then Jong Kook will be the end of you.
-No! No!

1308
01:22:54,100 --> 01:22:57,200
[Mr. Capable pushing on like a crazy man]

1309
01:23:02,110 --> 01:23:05,740
[Big-nosed brother attacks
Jong Kook like he had stated]

1310
01:23:05,740 --> 01:23:07,700
That was good! Suk Jin, you did good.

1311
01:23:07,710 --> 01:23:10,790
[Mr. Capable, who almost got ousted]

1312
01:23:11,420 --> 01:23:13,470
[Huh? That's...]

1313
01:23:14,800 --> 01:23:17,060
-It's him!
-Seriously?

1314
01:23:17,060 --> 01:23:20,690
If I'm not the one...if I'm not the one...
Jong Kook is going to end you.

1315
01:23:20,690 --> 01:23:21,930
-Suk Jin...
-What?

1316
01:23:22,200 --> 01:23:24,650
-I'll give you the win today.
-Really?

1317
01:23:24,650 --> 01:23:26,590
-Promise.
-Okay. I just need to oust him?

1318
01:23:26,590 --> 01:23:28,430
-Yeah, do it.
-Okay.

1319
01:23:29,520 --> 01:23:33,090
[Just...]

1320
01:23:33,710 --> 01:23:36,660
[What is going on...]

1321
01:23:37,090 --> 01:23:38,940
[What the...!]

1322
01:23:38,940 --> 01:23:40,820
-I just need to oust him, right?
-Okay. Do it.

1323
01:23:40,820 --> 01:23:43,960
[Big-nosed brother bought by
the promise of a win!]

1324
01:23:44,560 --> 01:23:46,730
<i>You really can betray me,
I'm telling you that you can.</i>

1325
01:23:46,740 --> 01:23:49,330
-Put everything into it! Hurry! Rip it off!
-Okay, I got it!

1326
01:23:49,330 --> 01:23:51,010
Hurry! Rip it!

1327
01:23:51,530 --> 01:23:53,660
[Ah...didn't even get to shoot it]

1328
01:23:53,660 --> 01:23:56,960
He even had a water gun.
I was wondering what he was holding.

1329
01:23:57,040 --> 01:24:00,020
[So disappointing...]

1330
01:24:00,680 --> 01:24:02,410
-You're in big trouble now.
-Why?

1331
01:24:02,410 --> 01:24:04,060
Why am I in big trouble?

1332
01:24:04,060 --> 01:24:06,410
[From Big-nosed brother's reed-like play...]

1333
01:24:06,410 --> 01:24:11,730
[...the war surrounding
the gold badge enters a new phase.]

1334
01:24:12,180 --> 01:24:14,010
-You have something, don't you?
-Yeah, I do.

1335
01:24:14,010 --> 01:24:16,040
So you had it all along!

1336
01:24:16,040 --> 01:24:18,570
Check it over here. Suk Jin...

1337
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:21,740
Yeah...it's not here. Where is it?

1338
01:24:23,700 --> 01:24:25,150
It's not there. Where is it?

1339
01:24:25,620 --> 01:24:26,980
You have it.

1340
01:24:26,980 --> 01:24:29,840
-Me?
-If you have it, seriously...

1341
01:24:29,840 --> 01:24:32,070
-Here it is.
-It was you?!

1342
01:24:32,070 --> 01:24:34,190
[The gold badge is found on Suk Jin!]

1343
01:24:34,710 --> 01:24:37,530
[Bewildered]
I had no idea!

1344
01:24:37,530 --> 01:24:40,030
-What the heck is this?
-You were lying to us?

1345
01:24:40,770 --> 01:24:43,200
So even the person who has it
doesn't know that they have it?

1346
01:24:43,880 --> 01:24:45,960
-This is really disappointing...
-I seriously had no idea.

1347
01:24:45,960 --> 01:24:48,020
This really is so disappointing.
After we even talked earlier...

1348
01:24:48,020 --> 01:24:50,580
-Since you have it now, you're in big trouble.
-Why? Why?

1349
01:24:50,580 --> 01:24:52,560
-What do you mean, why?
-That's the power there.

1350
01:24:53,020 --> 01:24:56,820
Jong Kook...Jong Kook is going to
go crazy now trying to oust you.

1351
01:24:56,820 --> 01:24:58,700
Jong Kook doesn't know.

1352
01:24:58,700 --> 01:25:01,150
-What do you mean, he doesn't know?
-Don't you have to give this to him too?

1353
01:25:01,150 --> 01:25:04,220
And Suk Jin...you can only shoot this once.

1354
01:25:04,220 --> 01:25:06,680
[Giving him the water gun that can
only be shot once.]

1355
01:25:07,120 --> 01:25:08,890
<i>Shin Young...</i>

1356
01:25:09,500 --> 01:25:11,540
Think about this. It's strange...

1357
01:25:11,540 --> 01:25:15,810
This is strange...
Someone should have it.

1358
01:25:16,380 --> 01:25:18,980
Ji Suk Jin didn't have it
when we searched him.

1359
01:25:20,150 --> 01:25:23,580
Then where is it?
If they all don't have it?

1360
01:25:23,580 --> 01:25:26,090
Do you have it?

1361
01:25:26,090 --> 01:25:28,640
-Then one of us two have it?
-Are you sure it's not you?

1362
01:25:28,640 --> 01:25:31,590
[Finally...the chase team is starting to
suspect one another!]

1363
01:25:31,590 --> 01:25:34,130
...We can just go down
to the press conference.

1364
01:25:34,130 --> 01:25:36,470
You think I'd just keep
holding you like this?

1365
01:25:37,270 --> 01:25:41,770
And now we're starting to suspect
each other in this situation.

1366
01:25:41,780 --> 01:25:44,360
The situation is awkward now...

1367
01:25:49,620 --> 01:25:53,080
It's too well-known now
that you have the gun.

1368
01:25:54,160 --> 01:25:57,750
Since it's too well-known that
you have the gun, give it to me for now.

1369
01:25:57,750 --> 01:25:59,360
-Why?
-Give it to me.

1370
01:25:59,360 --> 01:26:03,040
Why? How can you take the gun from me now?

1371
01:26:03,040 --> 01:26:06,480
Since it's too well-known that
you have the gun now...

1372
01:26:06,490 --> 01:26:10,170
-They all know it now anyways...
-No, show them that you don't have the gun...

1373
01:26:10,170 --> 01:26:12,870
And you can go talk to Jong Kook.

1374
01:26:12,870 --> 01:26:16,000
-Are you not trusting me right now?
-No, it's not that!

1375
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,260
But you're taking the gun from me
when we're at the end...

1376
01:26:18,270 --> 01:26:21,950
No, it's because it's become too
well-known that you have the gun.

1377
01:26:21,950 --> 01:26:25,350
Think about it.
Let's say that I go talk to Jong Kook.

1378
01:26:25,350 --> 01:26:31,310
Then he'll think that you're going to come up
and shoot him while he's talking to me...

1379
01:26:31,310 --> 01:26:34,220
So he's never going to
give us that opportunity.

1380
01:26:34,900 --> 01:26:38,910
So I'll either shoot him with the gun,
or tear off his name tag. Understand?

1381
01:26:39,430 --> 01:26:43,880
[Will this change in plans work?]

1382
01:26:44,390 --> 01:26:47,270
He said a change in plans...

1383
01:26:47,270 --> 01:26:49,670
'I'll take all the responsibility...'

1384
01:26:51,770 --> 01:26:55,780
If he takes all the responsibility,
he'll oust everyone...

1385
01:26:56,320 --> 01:26:58,760
And he'll take the victory.
Couldn't that be what he meant?

1386
01:26:58,760 --> 01:27:00,250
[Oust everyone,
and go to the press conference alone?]

1387
01:27:01,390 --> 01:27:05,100
[Just what could he be thinking?]

1388
01:27:13,110 --> 01:27:15,830
[No one saw that, right?]

1389
01:27:18,670 --> 01:27:22,640
[Sang Joong trying to face Jong Kook while
hiding the fact that he has the water gun.]

1390
01:27:25,250 --> 01:27:29,780
I bet he's hiding somewhere
planning something.

1391
01:27:31,580 --> 01:27:35,700
<i>[Kim Jong Kook-Out! Kim Jong Kook-Out!]</i>

1392
01:27:38,380 --> 01:27:43,120
So...ultimately, Jong Kook's been ousted?

1393
01:27:45,240 --> 01:27:47,480
[He was preparing for the showdown...]

1394
01:27:47,480 --> 01:27:49,620
How did Jong Kook get ousted?

1395
01:27:51,480 --> 01:27:53,230
Who shot him?

1396
01:27:53,230 --> 01:27:55,290
[Shin Young not knowing the situation either]

1397
01:27:55,290 --> 01:27:57,290
Something tells me that
Sang Joong shot him.

1398
01:27:59,530 --> 01:28:02,920
[So Sang Joong ousted Jong Kook...]

1399
01:28:05,050 --> 01:28:07,980
That's good that it happened.

1400
01:28:08,650 --> 01:28:11,570
I got rid of him without
having to get my hands dirty.

1401
01:28:14,580 --> 01:28:18,200
-Suk Jin, wait! I don't have anything.
-Come here. Are you alone?

1402
01:28:18,200 --> 01:28:21,750
[Shin Young running into
Big-nosed brother, the lone survivor]

1403
01:28:21,750 --> 01:28:25,330
-Trust me, and come here.
-What happened to Jong Kook?

1404
01:28:25,330 --> 01:28:26,990
I ousted him.

1405
01:28:26,990 --> 01:28:28,760
I shot him with the water gun.

1406
01:28:28,760 --> 01:28:30,980
[Ultimately, it was him...!]

1407
01:28:31,900 --> 01:28:34,460
[Just a little while ago]

1408
01:28:34,810 --> 01:28:37,300
You need to keep it hidden.
Put it in your pocket quickly.

1409
01:28:38,350 --> 01:28:40,260
[Just then!]

1410
01:28:41,010 --> 01:28:44,220
[With the water gun
that can only be shot once!]

1411
01:28:45,740 --> 01:28:49,950
[Mr. Capable-Out!]

1412
01:28:51,560 --> 01:28:54,680
[Big-nosed brother's gigantic hunt!]

1413
01:28:54,680 --> 01:28:57,240
I'll make you the winner today.

1414
01:28:57,240 --> 01:28:58,690
Seriously.

1415
01:28:58,690 --> 01:29:00,800
As long as we can oust
Sang Joong together.

1416
01:29:00,810 --> 01:29:05,780
Sang Joong came to me just now
and took the water gun from me.

1417
01:29:05,780 --> 01:29:09,760
Seriously? That's not right! He's a man!

1418
01:29:09,760 --> 01:29:13,030
-Does that even make sense?
-It doesn't matter if you're a man or a woman!

1419
01:29:14,630 --> 01:29:19,260
I'm telling you this now...
If we can oust Sang Joong, you'll win.

1420
01:29:19,260 --> 01:29:21,270
I'll seriously have you be the winner.

1421
01:29:23,630 --> 01:29:26,920
[Now the gold badge is definitely on Suk Jin!]

1422
01:29:26,920 --> 01:29:28,490
Here he comes!

1423
01:29:29,250 --> 01:29:30,560
Run away!

1424
01:29:33,050 --> 01:29:37,700
[It is a priority to escape
from Sang Joong who has the water gun!]

1425
01:29:42,440 --> 01:29:44,070
Did he see us coming in here?

1426
01:29:44,070 --> 01:29:45,450
Did he see us?

1427
01:29:49,040 --> 01:29:50,950
[With a spot on dead instinct]

1428
01:29:55,240 --> 01:29:58,070
[Sang Joong finding them
hiding in the same room]

1429
01:29:58,070 --> 01:30:01,590
-Suk Jin...you really...
-Wait...

1430
01:30:01,590 --> 01:30:03,640
You can't stay in there forever.

1431
01:30:04,980 --> 01:30:06,930
There's not much time left
until the press conference.

1432
01:30:08,460 --> 01:30:10,540
We can either go down
to the press conference together...

1433
01:30:11,410 --> 01:30:13,730
And split it 3 ways...

1434
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:17,540
Or one person take it all...

1435
01:30:19,900 --> 01:30:21,320
Sang Joong...

1436
01:30:24,790 --> 01:30:28,410
[Fine...without the need to go at it,
this water gun will just...]

1437
01:30:28,410 --> 01:30:30,020
Sang Joong...

1438
01:30:32,490 --> 01:30:37,140
[An imminent confrontation!]

1439
01:30:45,540 --> 01:30:48,290
[Sang Joong's name tag!]

1440
01:30:48,290 --> 01:30:51,620
[A surprise attack sprang on by his Aide!]

1441
01:30:54,120 --> 01:30:57,640
[This was an ambush plan
put together with the Big-nosed brother?]

1442
01:30:59,480 --> 01:31:00,780
<i>You really scared me!</i>

1443
01:31:01,300 --> 01:31:02,790
Sang Joong, sorry.

1444
01:31:03,560 --> 01:31:05,290
I'm so sorry!

1445
01:31:05,780 --> 01:31:08,210
I guess I don't know much about this game.

1446
01:31:10,420 --> 01:31:14,380
[Shin Young...
I had no idea that you'd betray me...]

1447
01:31:15,720 --> 01:31:19,620
<i>[Kim Sang Joong-Out! Kim Sang Joong-Out!]</i>

1448
01:31:19,620 --> 01:31:23,040
-Please come with me.
-I'm sorry. I'm so sorry!

1449
01:31:27,220 --> 01:31:28,730
Wow...Shin Young...

1450
01:31:37,480 --> 01:31:41,200
<i>[5 minutes before the press conference.
5 minutes before the press conference]</i>

1451
01:31:41,200 --> 01:31:43,620
-You have to search him.
-Yes, we do.

1452
01:31:44,290 --> 01:31:46,450
-You have to search to see if he has the gold.
-I'm going to do that.

1453
01:31:47,130 --> 01:31:50,650
-I'm really a big fan of yours.
-I'm a fan of yours too.

1454
01:31:51,480 --> 01:31:53,530
-Shin Young...you know something?
-What?

1455
01:31:53,750 --> 01:31:57,840
-That I can tear the tag off a woman?
-Yes, I do know that.

1456
01:31:57,840 --> 01:31:59,480
-So you've heard?
-Yes, I've heard.

1457
01:31:59,480 --> 01:32:01,850
Do you know who ousted Han Ji Min?

1458
01:32:01,850 --> 01:32:03,480
I was the one who ripped off her name tag.

1459

1467
01:32:33,550 --> 01:32:38,100
Whether it be in the drama, or here,
Shin Young...

1468
01:32:38,100 --> 01:32:42,500

01:33:11,190 --> 01:33:13,320
-You're angry, right?
-Yes!
