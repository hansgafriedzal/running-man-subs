It's a joke.
I just thought that you were being too stiff.

75
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:30,870
Let's ask the male lead to.
This is your first starring role, isn't it?

76
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:33,550
- Yes, that's correct.
- I heard that you don't have many scenes.

77
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:40,800
The way I see it, you'll start this way,
but at the end, it's "What the heck is this?"

78
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:44,270
- "What kind of a male lead is this?"
- Jae Suk, come on...

What is the most memorable scene
that you were in?

88
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:13,880
The scene where I take the shot.

89
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:19,380
- So without any substance...
- I'm in the shot for about 2 seconds...

90
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:23,320
[If he's in the scene for more than 2 seconds,
then he counts them all to be his scenes.]

91

factor in a love triangle story line.

92
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,130
This is your first time
acting with Lee Kwang Soo...

93
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:34,280
Are the feelings in acting
coming out well and naturally?

94
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,130
- It was very difficult.
- Really?

95
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:38,940
- But you haven't...
- You haven't even done any yet...

96
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:41,660
[Even just the thought of it makes her upset?]

97
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:45,490
I chose the role because I heard that
Gong Hyo Jin will be in the drama.

98
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:49,210
But with Kwang Soo being there too,
it did leave a bad feeling...

99
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:52,170
Ha Ha, what is your role?

100
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:55,540
My role is that of
Lee Kwang Soo's caretaker...

101
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:58,820
What are you talking about?

102
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:02,560
You know he's bed-ridden,
so my role takes care of him.

103
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,010
- That's your role?
- But since we're close in real life...

104
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:09,110
- Just thinking about it makes me tear up.
- Because you're really close to him?

105
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:11,430
I'm the third supporting role?

106
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,990
My role is to pull the plug
from his life support.

107
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:16,260
Why would you pull off my life support?

108

that's more detailed...

115
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:43,670
What can I say if you ask me to
say one more word to the audience?

116
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:45,900
Why do you keep asking her to say a word?

117
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:49,560
- What kind of a character do you play...
- Something more detailed.

118

- Yes, you oppose it.

I don't think this is right.

485
00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:00,500
I haven't even been able to say anything,
don't you think this is too much?

486
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:03,930
Just take a seat. That was too much.
Move over more, Ji Hyo.

487
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:07,880
Ji Hyo, you must have gotten really hurt.

488
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:11,790
- All at once...
- Ji Hyo, calm down.

489
00:30:14,010 --> 00:30:18,720
Hyo Jin, don't think of it too weirdly
since this is all an act.

490
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,570
I can think of it as being weird.

491

[An extreme pre-block]

492
00:30:25,010 --> 00:30:26,960

That will make her dizzy.

501
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:05,130
It's okay, Jong Kook.
It'll make my heart rate go up.

502

Seriously, what are you doing?
[Her heart rate keeps climbing up!]

505
00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:18,410

so naturally like that?

- Thank you.
- We won, we won.

516
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:46,010
Why are you lifting her up like that
without any permission?

517
00:31:46,890 --> 00:31:48,870
But I excused myself earlier.

518
00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:50,910

Ji Hyo...it's because you
dropped the flower.

536
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:58,430
- Stop that!
- Joon! You come and pick this up too.

537
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:06,890

- Really?
- I was so out of breath...

549
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:52,690
- I really couldn't catch my breath.
- I know. It's because you couldn't breathe.

550
