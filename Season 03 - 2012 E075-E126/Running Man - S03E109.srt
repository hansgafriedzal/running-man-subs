What's with the blue door and
the red door?

18
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:57,310
They usually have these when
idols makes guest appearances.

19
00:00:57,310 --> 00:01:00,170
- That's where the guests will come out.
- I think it's one male and one female guest.

44
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:43,530
Look at his shoulders!
His shoulders!

[National Marine Boy Hero
Park Tae Hwan in front of their eyes!]

46
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:51,230
Hey Jong Kook...
I don't think you'll win today.

47
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:53,550
I just have a feeling that you're not
going to win today.

48
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:56,770
- His shoulders look like a little kid's now.
- You're like a baby now.

49
00:02:56,770 --> 00:02:59,370
You're going to have to
work out some more.

50
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:03,530
- You're going to have to work out harder.
- Tae Hwan... please take care of us, seriously.

51
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:06,490
[Huh...his speech is slowly...?]
Why are you speaking in casual speech?

52
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:08,770
He's the nation's little brother!

53
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:10,480
If he's the nation's little brother,
then he's like my little brother!

54
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,140
He's a hero! A hero!

55
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:14,350
Tae Hwan,
you know what I mean, right?

56
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:16,620
Rip off Jong Kook's name tag
for us today.

57
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,870
- As you all may know already, Tae Hwan...
- Be quiet!

58
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:23,660
[Pretending to be close...]
Seriously... just give it a rest.

59
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:26,230
- Seriously, just give it a rest!
- Let him speak, so we can hear his voice.

60
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:28,810
He hasn't said a word yet.
Let him at least say hello.

61
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:31,480
Hello, I'm Park Tae Hwan,
the swimmer.

62
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:35,420
[Welcome to Running Man!]

63
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:39,150
- Park Tae Hwan...
- His looks are a bit exotic.

64
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:43,020
Seriously... all the women love him.

65
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:45,580
- It's because I have makeup on.
- You have makeup on?

66
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:49,750
- I have some makeup on my face.
- But he has very light makeup on.

67
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:53,030
How do you know if he has light
or heavy makeup on?

68
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:56,360
Whenever an athlete comes on the show,
he gets so excited!

69
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:59,840
I watched the documentary a while ago
about the London Olympics preparations.

70
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,610
- I did too!
- Who out there hasn't watched that?

71
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:05,570
- Tell me who hasn't seen it?
- While watching him weight train...

72
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,230
I was thinking the way he was doing
it isn't good for his back.

73
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:10,510
[Worrying about Tae Hwan's back while
watching him weight train]

74
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:12,630
- I'm sure he knew what he was doing!
- I was very worried watching that.

75
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:13,800
Did you all hear this?

76
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:17,240
While watching Park Tae Hwan who trains with
the best trainers and staff in the world

77
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,290
he was thinking
'That's not how he should be lifting.'

78
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:22,220
[Coach Kook-
'That's not how he should be lifting...']

79
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:26,440
[Like a dog trying to
teach the bird how to fly...]

80
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,970
He really is a mania... seriously.

81
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:31,960
I really was worried watching
how he weight trained.

82
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:36,140
I never even dreamed that Park Tae Hwan
would guest star on Running Man...

83
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:39,050
The truth is, with the London Olympics
I didn't get much chance to watch...

84
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:41,670
- I bet.
- I should've watched...

85
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,920
[It's ok. We understand 1000%.]

86
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:45,690
Who's name tag do you want to
rip off the most?

87
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:47,230
Yours.

88
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:53,030
[Olympic champion-like answer.]

89
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:57,160
So we have our Olympian Park Tae Hwan here,
but you're saying there's someone else?

90
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:00,380
[In that case, who's behind the red door?]

91
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:03,200
With Park Tae Hwan out here,
we're curious who else is behind the door?

92
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,230
Who are you?

93
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:12,630
- There's something in her hand!
- She's holding something!

94
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:14,040
Who is that?

95
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,420
[Ribbon?]

96
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:19,540
[In that case...!]

97
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:33,320
[The Rhythm Gymnastics' Fairy
Son Yeon Jae!]

98
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:37,300
Yeon Jae...!

99
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,510
[Trying to protect the athlete first.]

100
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:51,230
This is crazy!

101
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:53,200
Seriously?

102
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,860
- Yeon Jae!
- Yeon Jae!

103
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:58,220
- Hello.
- Go away! You're going to hurt her!

104
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:00,870
Pay some attention to Park Tae Hwan!

105
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:06,490
I'll... I'll just say my hello
and leave.

106
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:12,310
[Surprise! Son Yeon Jae is here too!]

107
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:14,650
Gary...

108
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:20,140
[Running Man losing their mental strings
over the appearance of two superstars.]

109
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:22,130
Let me be a playboy for just
one more day!

110
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:28,480
[The desperate plea from a man
who's already been spoken for.]

111
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,770
- It's the last time, Byul!
- My last!

112
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:37,450
You should've come on the show
three weeks ago!

113
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:42,850
We would all like to congratulate
Ha Ha's wedding one more time!

114
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:44,740
[Ha Ha, congratulations on your wedding]

115
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:48,120
My last!

116
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:52,590
[Whether he's awake or asleep, Haroro is
full of joy over thought of Miss Byul.]

117
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:55,390
- Now we should...
- Son Yeon Jae is here.

118
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:56,570
She's just like an angel...

119
00:06:56,570 --> 00:07:00,760
[Welcome, Rhythm Gymnastics' Fairy,
Son Yeon Jae!]

120
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,690
We need to do it for
Park Tae Hwan too.

121
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:07,860
Park Tae Hwan too.

122
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:13,310
- Why is my voice...
- Your behavior is different.

123
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:15,510
- Why are you being like that?
- Your tone and behavior are different.

124
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:18,440
And why are you standing here all of a sudden?
Go back to where you were standing earlier.

125
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:21,870
- Are you playing around right now?
- Why are you standing so far apart?

126
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:23,700
Think about it...
listen to me for a minute.

127
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:26,840
I stood there earlier.
It's only right that I stand here now.

128
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:31,060
Then Park Tae Hwan and Son Yeon Jae,
please trade your spots.

129
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:32,930
- Like this.
- That's much better!

130
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:35,140
Then now...

131
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:38,150
[Casually going in between...]

132
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:43,020
Seriously... it was shocking enough
to see Park Tae Hwan come out

133
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:45,160
but I had no idea that
Son Yeon Jae would be here too!

134
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,520
- Seriously...
- This is so unreal...

135
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,370
I watched all the Olympic games
when they were being broadcasted live...

136
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:52,380
Is there anyone out there
who hasn't?

137
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:55,150
- Why are you even saying that?
- What point do you have by saying that?

138
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:58,860
[Let's hear Son Yeon Jae's voice too..]

139
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:01,160
- Hello.
- Hello.

140
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:04,810
[Being caught even the slightest bit off guard
knocks their mental strings out of the water.]

141
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:07,740
Hello, I'm a Rhythm Gymnast,
Son Yeon Jae.

142
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:12,400
Son Yeon Jae on Running Man...

143
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:14,780
[Bee?]

144
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,760
- Oh my gosh!
- It's a bee! Go away!

145
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,330
[Iron clad wall of protection.]

146
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:23,560
[Over excited uncle-like fans.]

147
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,310
- But... this is...
- Even the bee recognizes the flower...

148
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:33,780
But that bee was working hard to chase
our Park Tae Hwan around too.

149
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:37,110
<i>He was afraid of being stung...
afraid of being stung himself.</i>

150
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:38,760
Even though I just said it a
moment ago...

151
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:43,710
Even though I don't know if Son Yeon Jae
will get to tear a name tag off or not

152
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:45,600
do you think you'll be alright?

153
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,730
Yes, I normally watch this
show often.

154
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:50,650
- You've watched Running Man before?
- Yes.

155
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:53,250
- You just stay quiet.
- Why?

156
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:54,960
I'm just interviewing her right now.

157
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:57,090
You just pay attention to Byul.

158
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:59,700
What about you then?
You pay attention to your own wife!

159
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:00,810
You're no better!

160
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:04,180
Since I have no one
that I need to pay attention to...

161
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:06,390
- Start over with Song Ji Hyo!
- Me? Why?

162
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:10,880
[A strong rejection?]

163
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,530
Why should I...
He says why should I...

164
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:19,800
If you were to rip off someone's name tag...
Park Tae Hwan said he wants to rip Ha Ha's...

165
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:22,240
- So who would you like to rip off first?
- I would also like to...

166
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:27,160
I would also like to...
[Son Yeon Jae ultimately picks Ha Ha!]

167
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:31,020
- Anyways, it's a good thing for us.
- Why?

168
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:33,950
I met him once when I was in
elementary school...

169
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:36,910
- Seriously?
- He came for some kind of a shoot...

170
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:39,300
- And?
- He didn't give me an autograph.

171
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:42,210
<i>He didn't give me an autograph.</i>

172
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:47,460
[Celebrity Ha Ha
left in young Yeon Jae's heart.]

173
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:51,290
[A remaining scar that
even a fortune can't take away.]

174
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:53,620
That really...
that must've left a really huge scar.

175
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:54,740
Were you out of your mind?

176
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:57,630
We did bother him some, since
we were all elementary school students.

177
00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:00,680
But he said 'You guys got it earlier!'
and didn't give us anymore autographs...

178
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,500
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

179
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,840
- I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.

180
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,390
I cleanse you of your sins.

181
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:11,630
[An already spilled glass of water
he can't hope to undo.]

182
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:14,580
- Let's stop talking about that now.
- Stop it.

183
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:19,970
Son Yeon Jae and Park Tae Hwan today...
How in the world did this happen?

184
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:22,900
[Being together with these two whose
sheer presence brings happiness.]

185
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:26,050
Since they're here, let's all take a seat
and listen to some of their stories...

186
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:28,280
- Okay.
- As much as they want to share with us.

187
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:31,640
Even if you feel Son Yeon Jae coming
up behind you, just stand still.

188
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,840
But that's no fun.

189
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:37,710
Good for you, good for you!

190
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:39,820
Since Yoo Jae Suk is Running Man!

191
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:44,800
[A twisted groom-to-be.]

192
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:48,440
I cleanse you of all your sins.

193
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,780
Well then,
what are we going to be doing?

194
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:57,320
<i>Today's Running Man will be divided into
3 teams of 3 members each.</i>

195
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:03,180
- If there's to be 3 teams, then us 3...
- How do we divide up the team?

196
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:08,570
Son Yeon Jae and Park Tae Hwan will play
Rock-Paper-Scissors

197
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:12,490
and the winner will have first pick
on who their teammate will be today.

198
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:19,200
[The 3 members who aren't chosen by them
will automatically become a team]

199
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,840
Well then, the two of you...

200
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:23,210
Yeon Jae, you would refer to Tae Hwan
as an older brother, right?

201
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:25,590
- Why don't you start then?
- Do we just start? Rock-Paper-Scissors...

202
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,730
Again, again.

203
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:35,620
[An embarrassing Rock-Paper-Scissors?]

204
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:39,700
- We've never really met face-to-face...
- Why is your face all red?

205
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:44,740
He says they've talked before but never
faced each other like this before.

206
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:48,280
We've only talked and never had to
face each other like this before...

207
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:52,140
- Well, you are in your prime...
- He's in the prime of his life...

208
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:54,540
<i>This is the best time...</i>

209
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:56,810
Let's do the Rock-Paper-Scissors again.

210
00:11:56,810 --> 00:11:59,010
[Son Yeon Jae wins.]

211
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:00,310
I...

212
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:04,550
I...

213
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:06,780
Yoo Jae Suk.

214
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:10,950
[Energetically spinning the ribbon.]

215
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:13,180
[Automatically turning into a dance?]

216
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:19,100
If I pick...

217
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:21,180
If I pick,
I'm afraid you may not be happy about it.

218
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:24,790
- What are you talking about?
- How can you say that?

219
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,700
That's nonsense, Park Tae Hwan.

220
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:30,370
Jong Kook really has
a lot of interest in swimming.

221
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:34,630
- That's one of his favorite sports.
- I like them all.

222
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:36,620
I like all sorts of sports.

223
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:39,280
- But if they team up, that's too...
- That's right.

224
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:41,380
Then why didn't you pick
Kim Jong Kook?

225
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:47,030
[Unable to be the playboy any longer,
everything has become twisted.]

226
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,510
I got a little jealous!

227
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,610
I'm going to pick Gary first.

228
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:57,210
[Wow! He chooses Gary!]

229
00:12:57,210 --> 00:13:01,180
[A disappointed Tiger?]

230
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:02,450
Look at how disappointed Jong Kook
is for not getting picked!

231
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:04,070
Gary won't be of any help to you
because he's been injured.

232
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:06,930
What? I can run! I can run!

233
00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:09,500
- Why are you saying stuff like that?
- You should quit running now.

234
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,800
- Your leg was barely even moving.
- Why are you being like this today!

235
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,370
- Seriously, why are you being like this now?
- That one leg isn't able to handle it.

236
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,590
Then another round of
Rock-Paper-Scissors.

237
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,990
- This is nerve wrecking.
- Rock-Paper-Scissors.

238
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:23,240
[Park Tae Hwan wins.]

239
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:29,240
Well then, I'm going to pick Kim Jong Kook.
[Chooses Jong Kook!]

240
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:32,200
Victory... victory... victory!

241
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:35,390
- That team has both of them?
- Originally...

242
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:39,710
I though Gary was fine,
but I just realized that he's injured...

243
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:42,080
Why are you saying that?
I can run!

244
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:45,820
In that case,
Park Tae Hwan's team is all set, right?

245
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:48,970
[A situation where Son Yeon Jae
needs to make her final selection.]

246
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:52,970
I was thinking of choosing
Kwang Soo...

247
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:04,510
She just asked me who she should pick,
and I told her to choose whomever she wants...

248
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:08,240
and she says that she originally wanted to
pick Kwang Soo, but he's just so bad...

249
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,330
[Dilemma...]

250
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:18,160
Then I... what do I do?

251
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:23,870
[Huh?]

252
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,740
Kwang Soo...

253
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,920
[Selects Kwang Soo!]

254
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:38,490
[A wrong selection
due to the stress from heat.]

255
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:47,570
[Team selection complete!]

256
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:52,990
The 3 teams... will now seriously start with
our all-star guests we have on today.

257
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:54,690
- Kwang Soo, you must be very happy?
- Yes?

258
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:56,980
Yes, I wonder if this is what
Heaven is like?

259
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:02,660
Well then...
we will now get off to a start.

260
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:08,070
- Kwang Soo... shall we go?
- Let's go!

261
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:11,060
Okay... start!

262
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:14,720
[With the Olympic heroes,
the race starts now!]

263
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:18,120
Wait a minute...
we haven't heard the rules yet.

264
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:23,460
[Too busy exchanging pleasantries.]

265
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:25,640
<i>An important...</i>

266
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:28,810
- You haven't heard the important rule yet.
- What can be important about a rule?

267
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:32,020
Simmer down a little.
Why are you being like that?

268
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:34,720
- Everyone move over a little.
- Yes, I understand.

269
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:41,610
<i>Today's mission is
Four Season Training Camp Race.</i>

270

[Today's mission:
Four Season Training Camp Race]

[The Four Season Training Camp containing
specialties of each season starts now!]

273
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:59,250
[A shocking advantage to the team
that places first in each of the missions!]

274
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:03,450
[That's the chance to change the
size of the name tag!]

275
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:05,660
Let's do whatever we can
to make Jong Kook's large.

276
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:07,630
Park Tae Hwan and Jong Kook's.

277
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:12,030
[Frightening partnership of two power houses,
Park Tae Hwan and Kim Jong kook]

278
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:15,600
[Run across the street to 'D' amusement park
and find the Running Man landmark]

[The first Four Season
Training Camp Race mission is...]

280

[at the amusement park
right across the street!]

281
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:25,830
- Shall we get going?
- Let's go.

282
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,620
- Should we run over there?
- There's no reason to run over there.

283
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:32,830
- But it's good to get there fast.
- Getting there fast is a good thing.

284
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:36,340
Gary, let's all talk comfortably
amongst ourselves today.

285
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:38,270
It's good to see you, Tae Hwan.

286
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:41,470
- It's good to see you, Tae Hwan.
- Tae Hwan, can I lower my speech with you?

287
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:42,920
Okay, Tae Hwan.

288
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:44,340
Yeon Jae!

289
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:46,440
I remember you now!
It was you!

[It's already too late...]

- I remember now.
- You're a married man.

[A belated wash of regret...]

293
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:02,490
[Run towards the flag!]

294
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:03,780
- That's so fascinating.
- There it is!

295
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:06,580
- What's fascinating?
- That I'm here like this...

296

- Spring?

<i>This is an amusement park where lots of
people come out for a spring picnic.</i>

301

<i>Once you get inside,
you'll find two games have been prepared.</i>

302
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:31,460
<i>You have to quickly pass through those games.
Each time you pass one, you'll get a stamp.</i>

303
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:34,260
- Okay.
- Then shall we go?

304
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:37,110
- The games have already been set?
- What are those games?

305
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:44,970

- You can feel his nervousness...</i>

entering with a bright smile on her face.]

307

- Have you ever been to an amusement park?
- Yes.

308
00:17:56,290 --> 00:17:59,020
- What about you?
- Even when you were little?

309
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:01,330
Then have you only been swimming?

310
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:03,790
I see that you were
fit to win that gold medal.

311
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:07,030
And can we...
once we get a little closer...

312
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,660
- Can we call you Yeon Jae?
- Yes.

313
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:12,150
But I don't know how to
address the two of you...

314
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:14,460
[Oh my goodness...
putting on the cute act?]

[Jae Suk piling on the cute act so that
they can lower their speech to one another.]

316
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:22,060
- What are you doing?
- Why? What does it matter to you?

317
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:23,660
Why are you embarrassing us like that?

318
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:24,930

00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:53,660
<i>80 points or above is a pass,
and extra points for choreographed dancing.</i>

326
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:55,950
- Why don't we go first?
- Hurry it up.

327
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:58,380
Let's sing 'Apgujeong Nalnari'.

328
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:02,240
Stand under the mike here.

329
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,730
Sing it loudly...

330
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:09,760
Running Man's own singing show.

331
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,360
My goodness!

332
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,410
- Are you ready?
- Yes!

333
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:21,740
[Start of choreographed dancing
on top of the trampoline.]

334
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:27,830
[Their dancing showcase that's
happening right in front of their eyes.]

335
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:31,870
- Okay! Yeon Jae and Jae Suk!
- What about me?

336
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:36,620
<i>1, 2, 3!
Come on over, beautiful you...</i>

337
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:40,520
<i>Have you come over to play?</i>

338
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:43,370
[The key is to sing the song as
close you can to the mike.]

339
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:45,400
<i>Have a drink...</i>

340
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:50,130
- Get up front.
- Get closer to the mike.

341
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:55,240
<i>Whenever I think of you
as the time goes by...</i>

342
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:58,060
[Jae Suk crashes from not being
able to catch his balance.]

343
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:01,780
[Jae Suk not being able to get
back on his feet.]

344
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,170
<i>Apgujong!</i>

345
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:12,230
[The highlight is definitely...]

346
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:23,810
[Going after the extra points for the
added choreographed dance.]

347
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:27,910
[Karaoke room training that requires ultimate
physical strength and throat muscles.]

348
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,590
Your knee...

349
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:31,700
<i>Good job.</i>

350
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:35,040
What's the score?

351
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:38,290
<i>- 5 points for the dancing.
- Okay.</i>

352
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:41,570
<i>- We'll say 5 points for the dancing...
- Sixty...</i>

353
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:43,280
<i>...one points.</i>

354
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,810
[80 point to pass, but fails
with a total score of 66 points.]

355
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:51,070
And our Gary's back...
isn't very well right now.

356
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:55,260
- So he can't really be jumping.
- I'll stand here and shout as loud as I can.

357
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:58,630
Let's go with 'Because you're lovely'.
Let's go!

358
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:05,480
<i>From the top of the head
to the tips of your toes...</i>

359
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:09,470
<i>You're so lovely!</i>

360
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:14,600
<i>The fact that you're my woman
is just so lovely!</i>

361
00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:19,990
<i>Waiting for you is enjoyable,
and even the air tastes much sweeter.</i>

362
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:25,040
<i>This is all the reasons why...
I love you!</i>

363
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:31,730
Is it over?
No, it's not over yet.

364
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:34,760
[Mistakenly thinking that it was over.]

365
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:38,700
Yeon Jae...
you know who Yoon Eun Hye is, right?

366
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:41,860
<i>That's right... you do know.
[Of course, aren't they a couple?]</i>

367
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:45,440
<i>They really used to like each other.
He used to sing stuff like this to her a lot.</i>

368
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,440
<i>His song, 'One Man' came out
around then.</i>

369
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,340
<i>And 'Walking in place' was when
he and Eun Hye first started.</i>

370
00:21:51,630 --> 00:21:56,660
<i>This was when... they were totally
head over heels in love.</i>

371
00:21:57,430 --> 00:21:58,570
<i>Eun Hye...</i>

372
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:00,080
- Seriously...
- Did you hear the song?

373
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:02,050
Stop it!

374
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:08,390
<i>Your score is 74 points.</i>

375
00:22:08,390 --> 00:22:11,420
<i>And combined with the added points
from your dancing, it's 77 points.</i>

376
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:14,890
- So they're disqualified, right?
- Yes.

377
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:17,700
What song should we sing?

378
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,890
But I'm very sensitive
about being disqualified.

379
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:23,560
<i>But I'm very sensitive
about being disqualified.</i>

380
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:28,100
['Disqualified' is a taboo word...]

381
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:32,060
- Awesome...
- Do you understand what I mean or no?

382
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:35,860
Jae Suk,
give him a formal apology.

383
00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:40,140
- Jae Suk, that was the wrong thing to say.
- His spirit is down now.

384
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:43,670
[Even though he's
saying it while laughing...]

385
00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:46,420
I should just sew my mouth shut!

386
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:47,900
Since it's you, it's okay.

387
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:52,160
Since you said it's okay, I won't.
[Ultimate caution in front of Tae Hwan]

388
00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:55,120
<i>- Is it fun?
- Yes.</i>

389
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,320
<i>It's total hell over here!</i>

390
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:59,790
<i>The staff hasn't laughed even once!</i>

391
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:03,700
- Is it fun?
- It's total chaos over here.

392
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:06,890
- It's total chaos over here.
- Everyone is frowning over here.

393
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:10,440
<i>Please make it fun!</i>

394
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:12,980
That team is going to be shown
on the show too, right?

395
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:15,680
- They're being shot separately.
- Oh, really?

396
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:18,570
You know to keep your head on straight, right?
Otherwise, our segment will get cut.

397
00:23:18,570 --> 00:23:20,940
[If they don't keep their head on straight,
they could be all cut out.]

398
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:23,820
[Placing first is their goal.]
Fighting!

399
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:25,230
Fighting!

400
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,090
Fighting!

401
00:23:30,290 --> 00:23:34,220
<i>Two of you need to get to this side
and take the other person on the mattress</i>

402
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:40,430
<i>and you have to take the mission given
on the other side and do it over here.</i>

403
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:42,030
<i>Fighting!</i>

404
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:43,910
[Go!]

405
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:55,410
[Falling straight on top of the water.]

406

[A battle breaking out inside the water ball.]

407
00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:04,610
Why do I keep going to the side?

408
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:08,350
[No matter how much he tries,
he just keeps on spinning in place.]

409

they use the ball to cross the river...?]

412
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:29,840
<i>Suk Jin! This is way too hard!</i>

the same at the karaoke room.]

all this while...]

[Welcome to Running Man's
Four Season Training Camp]

417

Listen...

418
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:56,070
If these world class Olympic athletes
say that it's hard...

419
00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:57,960
it's like death to us.

420
00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:01,140
Don't you think this is just way too hard?
Even these two are finding this difficult.

421
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:02,890
- Tae Hwan...
- I'm fine.

422
00:25:02,890 --> 00:25:07,280
What a joke!
What a joke that you're fine!

423
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:10,690
Hey...
he's the pride of our country!

424
00:25:10,690 --> 00:25:12,370
Don't speak so rashly towards him!

425
00:25:12,670 --> 00:25:14,080
Tae Hwan's not having a hard time.

426
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,540
Tell me now, I know that 1500m is hard too,
but what do you think of this?

427
00:25:17,050 --> 00:25:18,960
Make me swim the 1500m instead.

428
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:23,880
- We're going with the number song.
- We'll take the number song.

429
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,320
- The number song?
- It's Yeon Jae's favorite song.

430

- That looks fun.
- That looks like fun.

431
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,850
This is the song that we all used to
sing while in elementary school.

No, no... just even at a glance,
I don't think you'll get the points needed.

441
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:29,170
I saw it Jae Suk...
I already saw the score.

442

score enough points...]

I saw it, Yeon Jae.

445
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:41,040
I will give you extra 20 points more
your dancing.

00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:45,050
[They sang until their throats went hoarse,
but that's how low their points are?]

447
00:26:45,050 --> 00:26:49,190
- I'll give you 20 points.
- We'll wait for the score like the Olympics.

a round of applause]

<i>Seventy...</i>

491
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:34,430
If it's 71 points, it would be funny.

492
00:29:34,430 --> 00:29:36,360
No, that won't be funny.

493
00:29:37,290 --> 00:29:40,140
- That really wouldn't be funny.
- 71 points would be really funny.

[Yeon Jae feeling sick of the
karaoke room training.]

495

- That's all he can do inside the ball.

- Tae Hwan...
- Running Man...

519
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,330
Isn't a very good program after all.

520
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:06,080
When I'm swimming the 200m,
the 5m felt like 500m...

521
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:09,930
And this is... like 100 times that.

522
00:32:10,690 --> 00:32:13,380
And this isn't... all of it, right?

523
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:15,640
- There's more to come, right?
- Of course.

524
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:17,290
- This is the beginning.
The beginning?

525
00:32:17,290 --> 00:32:19,350
I'm not good with starting races.

526
00:32:21,050 --> 00:32:24,060
- You have your spurts, right?
- Yes, I have my spurts.

527
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:26,200
How many different courses
are there today?

528
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,610
Are there 3-4 courses?

529
00:32:27,610 --> 00:32:30,020
- About that...
- Once I pass the second course...

530

guns blazing after the second course?]

side is also being given his statement.]

And after a little while,
the interest fades too.

They seem like
they're really drunk over there...

[Feels as though those people's
dinner party may have gone overboard?]

561
00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:53,500
And not drink too much...

562
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:01,410
[Screaming tactic...]

- Why? What's the score?
- Why are you laughing?

568

570

[Wow! Passes with 95 points!]

571
00:35:33,530 --> 00:35:35,880
<i>Since you passed in first place...</i>

572

<i>You can choose one person from either
team and make their name bigger</i>

573
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:45,630
<i>or you can choose one person from your
own team and make the name smaller.</i>

574
00:35:49,870 --> 00:35:52,400
- Bigger. Make it bigger.
- I understand.

575

to make their name tag larger.]

[Go to 'O' restaurant in Uijeongbu
and find the Running Man landmark.]

578

Let's get first place again
since we've already done it once.

579
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:16,240
The only guarantee that we have for being
on air is to keep getting first place.

580
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:20,890
Since we're going in second place,
this in no way is being late.

581
00:36:20,890 --> 00:36:25,200
- Last week, I ripped off Jong Kook's name...
- Don't say things like that so rashly.

582
00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:29,010
- Stop saying this like that.
- Jae Suk, then what do I say?

583
00:36:29,010 --> 00:36:31,500
You just worry about yourself
since Yeon Jae's taking care of herself.

584
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:33,120
Seriously...

585
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:36,810
Kwang Soo... seriously know that
this is an honor for you today.

586
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:40,690
[A dreamlike partnership with
Rhythm Gymnastics Fairy.]

587
00:36:41,090 --> 00:36:43,100
We were seriously so nervous.

588
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:46,960
Like we mentioned earlier,
when you would spin that ball around...

589
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:51,830
My hands tend to get really sweaty,
so those balls can get very slippery.

590
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:55,890
[Despite all that...]

591
00:36:55,890 --> 00:36:58,520
[Yeon Jae always putting on a lovely
show with a bright smile on her face...]

592
00:36:59,790 --> 00:37:03,350
- The ball would fly out of my hand...
- I can imagine...

593
00:37:03,350 --> 00:37:05,930
That was so sad how the ball
slipped out of her hand like that.

594
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:11,500
At a match before the Olympics,
a ball flew out of the ring like that too.

595
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:14,650
- So...
- What do you do in a situation like that?

596
00:37:14,650 --> 00:37:16,650
What do you do in the arena
when that happens?

597
00:37:17,250 --> 00:37:20,480
I have to go chase after the ball,
and bring it back...

598
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:24,470
You've been doing gymnastics
since elementary school, right?

599
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:27,720
- I started it as a hobby when I was six.
- At six years old?

600
00:37:28,690 --> 00:37:30,480
How did you first pick gymnastics?

601
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:35,640
We didn't know what it really was,
but my mom said that it would be pretty...

602
00:37:37,050 --> 00:37:38,460
I see.

603
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:43,650
- Your coach... her impression is very...
- My Russian coach?

604
00:37:43,650 --> 00:37:44,840
Yeah, your Russian Coach.

605
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,800
She looks very nice,
she's not very scary right?

606
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:49,850
She speaks to me in
a very calm and quiet manner.

607
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:52,030
- Very quiet...
- And tells me 'Do it again' so gently.

608
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:56,590
[Smooth criticizing style]

609
00:37:56,590 --> 00:37:58,770
Even though she doesn't scold you...

610
00:37:58,770 --> 00:38:02,280
- That wasn't right, so do it again...
- If you do it again, you'll be in trouble.

611
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:05,060
I'm so happy.

612
00:38:05,490 --> 00:38:07,970
- I think Running Man is really fun.
- Really?

613
00:38:08,130 --> 00:38:11,490
It seems more fun than just
watching it on TV.

614
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:16,140
<i>This is just the beginning,
but we're in big trouble. </i>

615
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:19,300
What do we do about your
name tag, Tae Hwan?

616
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:21,570
[Huh? Tae Hwan's name tag is...]

617
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:26,080
Park Tae Hwan.

618
00:38:26,890 --> 00:38:28,570
Bigger.

619
00:38:29,350 --> 00:38:32,620
[The Blue team has chosen to make
Tae Hwan's name tag bigger.]

620
00:38:35,870 --> 00:38:37,320
I feel like I'm going to start flying now.

621
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:41,280
[An extremely enlarged Tae Hwan's
name tag.]

622
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,950
It's really funny seeing it from behind.

623
00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:47,580
[A big laughter from looking at it
from the back.]

624
00:38:49,370 --> 00:38:52,190
[Will return it back to its original size
with the next game!]

625
00:38:52,190 --> 00:38:54,790
We can't ruin our world star like this.

626
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:59,750
We have to think of it as an honor to even
be in the same car with him...

627
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:04,440
The reason being...
is that Tae Hwan is a hero.

628
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,150
Thank you.

629
00:39:06,150 --> 00:39:07,920
You know yourself that
you're great.

630
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:11,990
- To be honest, you feel that way a little?
- Well, I keep that thought to myself...

631
00:39:13,850 --> 00:39:16,650
[Be humble.]

632
00:39:16,650 --> 00:39:19,430
- He's the King with the endings.
- He's a warrior.

633
00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:24,200
Tae Hwan, so I'm curious... what songs
do you listen to on your headphones?

634
00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:27,100
Before your matches...

635
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:31,770
- Everyone is very curious about it.
- What song is it that you listen to?

636
00:39:32,090 --> 00:39:36,230
There's a separate song that
I listen to only before a match.

637
00:39:36,230 --> 00:39:38,040
- We're totally curious.
- What is it?

638
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:42,160
- It's a song that really energizes me.
- Oh... I see.

639
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:46,280
- To get your energy up and the rhythm...
- I think I need to come up with a fast song.

640
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:49,830
Instead of all the sad songs
filled with longing.

641
00:39:49,830 --> 00:39:52,720
- What do you usually do on your time off?
- You don't drink either, do you?

642
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:59,020
This whole year, since I have had the
Olympics as my goal to work towards...

643
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:01,410
I drank once this whole past year.

644
00:40:01,410 --> 00:40:04,400
That's pretty similar to me.
I only drink once a year on my birthday.

645
00:40:04,750 --> 00:40:06,480
When you drank on your birthday...

646
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:09,780
You drank until you couldn't even
remember anything from it, Jong Kook.

647
00:40:10,870 --> 00:40:14,690
But I think that is really admirable.
To get to your own goal...

648
00:40:14,690 --> 00:40:18,370
[So admirable...
The determination to reach his goal]

649
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:23,170
- Yeon Jae seemed really excited earlier.
- She really is very pretty.

650
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:24,930
- Isn't she really pretty?
- She's really pretty.

651
00:40:24,930 --> 00:40:27,620
- I do remember giving Yeon Jae an autograph.
- Really?

652
00:40:28,070 --> 00:40:30,530
[What a joke...]

653
00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:33,050
Don't lie.

654
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:37,940
It's Uijeongbu's Budae stew alley.
[Arrived at the mission location?]

655
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:40,620
- That sounds so good.
- Uijeongbu's Budae stew is the best!

656
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:41,790
[The home of Budae stew.]

657
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:47,420
[All the famous Budae stew's
restaurants all on one street!]

658
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,390
<i>Uijeongbu!</i>

659
00:40:51,390 --> 00:40:54,250
- Budae Stew!
- Yay!

660
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:06,080
<i>Hello!</i>

661
00:41:09,130 --> 00:41:10,200
What's this?

662
00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:14,740
Hello there. Have you seen
the name tag on Park Tae Hwan?

663
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:17,760
- Yeah, we saw it.
- We made it bigger.

664
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:23,670
[Even Tae Hwan with his
king-sized wings also arrives.]

665
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:28,120
Look at your wings!
You look like you'll fly away!

666
00:41:29,490 --> 00:41:31,240
Show it to us.

667
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,250
That's really huge!

668
00:41:34,290 --> 00:41:36,870
He may fly away if we don't anchor
him down in the middle...

669
00:41:37,650 --> 00:41:39,300
But you know something?

670
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:42,210
No matter which one of you wins
of the two teams...

671
00:41:42,850 --> 00:41:46,280
You have to enlarge
Kim Jong Kook's name tag.

672
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,120
Let's not do the coalition thing here.

673
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:53,170
- I'll take care of you.
- You just take care of your own back!

674
00:41:53,170 --> 00:41:55,950
- I will! Don't worry.
- Forget it!

675
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:59,330
I'm telling you this now,
but Gary is as good as not being here.

676
00:41:59,330 --> 00:42:03,750
- Jong Kook, I'm sitting right here.
- Even though he is, he may as well not be...

677
00:42:03,750 --> 00:42:06,430
- It really is good to hear that voice.
- We really missed you, Gary.

678
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:09,300
I missed saying 'Trying, Sir' so much that
I kept repeating it to myself at home.

679
00:42:10,590 --> 00:42:12,740
<i>This is your summer training mission.</i>

680
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:14,580
<i>Please take a look inside your pots.</i>

681
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:18,260
- It's the broth style!
- It's broth, with nothing in it.

682
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:24,370
<i>Through a series of games, the winning
team can take one ingredient at a time.</i>

683
00:42:25,130 --> 00:42:28,250
[Only one item per win.]

684
00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:31,250
- So the person who wins...
- The person that wins can keep playing.

685
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:34,490
That person can keep on playing.

686
00:42:34,490 --> 00:42:37,580
- There's only one type of game.
- What is it?

687
00:42:38,590 --> 00:42:40,690
[Production assistant.
Nickname: Grasshopper]

688
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:44,250
- Is it Oh-mok?
- I don't think it's Oh-mok.

689
00:42:45,260 --> 00:42:48,740
[The game is... Alkkagi!]
(Knocking opponent's off with yours]

690
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:52,060
Okay then, Kwang Soo!
You said you're good at this, right?

691
00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:54,550
- Who would you like to play against?
- Who should I play against?

692
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:56,670
- How about Tae Hwan?
- That's right...okay.

693
00:42:56,670 --> 00:42:58,340
1, 2, 3. Tae Hwan!

694
00:42:59,570 --> 00:43:00,720
Tae Hwan.

695
00:43:02,250 --> 00:43:04,120
<i>I really want to rip off his wings.</i>

696
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:06,560
- Okay, choose who'll go first.
- Paper-Rock-Scissors.

697
00:43:08,410 --> 00:43:10,470
[Starting off with Kwang Soo's win.]

698
00:43:15,010 --> 00:43:17,210
[Giraffe knowing to
dedicate a point on his own.]

699
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:23,470
- There's no need to flick it too hard.
- Keep your place, keep your place.

700
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:26,190
If you do it too hard, it could fly off.
That's right... that's good.

701
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:29,000
[Tae Hwan focusing on his defense.]

702
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,880
Kwang Soo, this is your chance.

703
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:35,510
[Giraffe succeeds at the attack!]

704
00:43:35,510 --> 00:43:37,040
<i>Why are you trying to beat
Park Tae Hwan?</i>

705
00:43:39,250 --> 00:43:41,380
[Tae Hwan's attack.]

706
00:43:42,060 --> 00:43:45,410
- Do it with the one in the back.
- Just use that other one instead...

707
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:47,660
[Very chatty coaching.]

708
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:50,340
- Over here?
- Then the other one is left vulnerable.

709
00:43:50,350 --> 00:43:51,490
No, no, it's okay.

710
00:43:52,190 --> 00:43:53,970
[Have totally moved over to
the next table...]

711
00:43:55,340 --> 00:43:57,900
[A confused and bewildered Tae Hwan.]

712
00:43:57,900 --> 00:44:00,080
- He has to get that other one first.
- Hit the one I'm telling you to.

713
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:03,470
If you were to block that over there,
he won't be able to move.

714
00:44:03,470 --> 00:44:06,470
You have to block him.
Move the black one over there.

715
00:44:08,090 --> 00:44:11,030
[Coach Kook's meticulous strategy
being ordered out.]

716
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:15,130
Wait. One at a time.
Only one person at a time speak.

717
00:44:15,130 --> 00:44:17,350
I'll speak. Tae Hwan, listen...

718
00:44:17,350 --> 00:44:22,150
If you move that one over just a little bit,
he has to come that way for his move.

719
00:44:22,150 --> 00:44:26,030
- So just don't get it too close to his.
- That's right. Good job.

720
00:44:26,490 --> 00:44:29,210
[Just for this little move...]

721
00:44:29,210 --> 00:44:32,470
That's right...
don't even worry about it.

722
00:44:35,610 --> 00:44:38,150
- Please don't blow in my ear.
- I'm not blowing in your ear!

723
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:41,530
<i>- He's so strange!
- Kwang Soo, calm down.</i>

724
00:44:44,710 --> 00:44:46,470
[Look at this guy...]

725
00:44:47,690 --> 00:44:52,410
[Somehow wedging his way in...]

726
00:44:52,410 --> 00:44:54,670
[Attack!]

727
00:44:56,130 --> 00:44:57,510
He's good.

728
00:44:59,030 --> 00:45:01,560
- No, no, no!
- No, that's good!

729
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:04,320
[It's the Coach Kook's strategy time again]

730
00:45:08,610 --> 00:45:10,430
[An inner fight between the coaches?]

731
00:45:11,730 --> 00:45:14,910
- Yeah, go for it.
- See? I told you!

732
00:45:14,910 --> 00:45:17,810
No, if he hit it a bit harder,
it could've been good.

733
00:45:17,810 --> 00:45:22,240
- I'll do it this time.
- 5, 4, 3, 2, 1...

734
00:45:22,270 --> 00:45:25,500
- Let's see this!
- Let's see this!

735
00:45:25,510 --> 00:45:28,070
[The precise attack succeeds!]

736
00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:31,590
[Currently - White: 2, Black: 1]

737
00:45:32,310 --> 00:45:35,290
- Which one?
- That one. Be ambitious!

738
00:45:35,290 --> 00:45:36,890
- This one?
- Be ambitious! Be ambitious!

739
00:45:36,890 --> 00:45:38,950
- You think you can do it?
- Protect your space, protect it.

740
00:45:38,950 --> 00:45:42,210
Don't just nudge it,
but smack it out of there this time.

741
00:45:43,550 --> 00:45:46,270
[Tae Hwan's first time with Alkkagi,
and it seems he's still not used to it.]

742
00:45:46,270 --> 00:45:49,400
- Hit it towards me. Towards me.
- Don't you think the other way is better?

743
00:45:49,860 --> 00:45:51,600
- What do you want me to do, Yeon Jae?
- That one.

744
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:52,970
- That way with this one?
- No.

745
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:54,340
- Then this way with that one?
- Yes.

746
00:45:54,370 --> 00:45:55,540
Kwang Soo...

747
00:46:02,070 --> 00:46:03,480
What to do?

748
00:46:04,810 --> 00:46:07,390
[Giraffe crumbling down all on his own.]

749
00:46:08,860 --> 00:46:12,170
- Kwang Soo...
- Wait, keep to your corner, Coach!

750
00:46:12,170 --> 00:46:14,440
- What did you say?
- This is our corner.

751
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:17,080
- This is our Coach's box!
- Where is there such a thing here?

752
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:19,080
- Your coach box is over there.
- Who made up those rules?

753
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:22,340
- This is an international match right now.
- How is this an international match?

754
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:27,330
[Untiring Coach Kook and Coach Gae.]

755
00:46:27,340 --> 00:46:30,260
That's right.
Think of it as following that line.

756
00:46:30,260 --> 00:46:31,590
Kwang Soo!

757
00:46:32,260 --> 00:46:35,110
[A staggering coaches' box.]

758
00:46:35,110 --> 00:46:38,030
Kwang Soo, it's one.
There's just one chance.

759
00:46:38,030 --> 00:46:39,660
This is a total chance.

760
00:46:40,610 --> 00:46:42,920
Good. That's good, Kwang Soo.

761
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:45,220
That's not an easy position
to be attacking from.

762
00:46:48,930 --> 00:46:52,280
- That's fine!
- You have a chance now, Tae Hwan!

763
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:55,070
[Now it's Tae Hwan's chance!]

764
00:46:55,070 --> 00:46:57,700
Let's do this with confidence.
Move over there.

765
00:46:57,700 --> 00:47:02,560
Tae Hwan, do it with confidence.
You have to oust him this time, okay?

766
00:47:03,570 --> 00:47:05,480
[Attack succeeds!]

767
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:07,430
[Tae Hwan wins.]

768
00:47:12,610 --> 00:47:15,170
Kwang Soo, you should've ousted him.
You should've ousted him then.

769
00:47:17,540 --> 00:47:18,680
Move.

770
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:20,880
- Should we get the sausage?
- Yeah! Sausage!

771
00:47:20,890 --> 00:47:22,200
[The Green team takes the sausage.]

772
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:23,650
He's a gambler.

773
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:27,670
[An ending with manners.]

774
00:47:27,670 --> 00:47:30,270
- Shaking each other's hand like that.
- Ha Ha, fighting!

775
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:32,350
[Blue Team's Ha Ha takes the challenge.]

776
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:34,310
You have to keep playing.

777
00:47:34,310 --> 00:47:36,670
I'm sorry,
but can you leave the ramen alone?

778
00:47:36,670 --> 00:47:38,870
Yeon Jae really wants the ramen.

779
00:47:38,870 --> 00:47:40,500
Let's get the ramen.

780
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:44,620
[Inconsiderate Impala...]

781
00:47:44,620 --> 00:47:47,270
- There are three of us here.
- You have to win like the last time, okay?

782
00:47:47,780 --> 00:47:49,980
[Ha Ha vs. Tae Hwan]

783
00:47:49,980 --> 00:47:54,550
Good job, good job.
[Early exploration.]

784
00:47:54,550 --> 00:47:57,180
Wait! Do it!
You have to make a play now.

785
00:47:57,180 --> 00:48:00,000
<i>- Should we make a play for it now?
- Good, good. Okay!</i>

786
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,250
[Coach Kook and Coach Gae ordering
for an aggressive attack]

787
00:48:04,420 --> 00:48:07,010
- Both of you please go to your coach box!
- It's because we can't see.

788
00:48:07,020 --> 00:48:09,310
Do it! Make the attack now!

789
00:48:09,410 --> 00:48:11,740
[Oh no... a miss!]

790
00:48:12,550 --> 00:48:15,870
[Ha Ha with the opportunity]

791
00:48:15,870 --> 00:48:17,240
Don't you think
the middle one would be better?

792
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:20,330
[Attack succeeds!]

793
00:48:21,190 --> 00:48:23,890
[Ha Ha ahead by one!]

794
00:48:24,470 --> 00:48:26,280
- The middle one.
- Go for the middle one.

795
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:29,320
[Coach Kook ordering a drastic attack.]

796
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:31,640
Hit it all the way!
Hit that white out of there!

797
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:35,100
Trust it! Trust it and go!
[Misses again!]

798
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:36,370
That shot was a little weak.

799
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:39,760
[A black and white bead
are both out!]

800
00:48:41,380 --> 00:48:43,900
[Ha Ha is still ahead.]

801
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:46,300
- It could turn over at any moment.
- Wait...

802
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:49,590
Attack!
Tae Hwan, attack that one!

803
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:51,720
- You startled me.
- You have to attack! Attack it now!

804
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:55,730
- That totally scared me.
- I'm sorry.

805
00:48:55,730 --> 00:48:58,030
[The endless forceful orders.]

806
00:48:58,030 --> 00:49:00,210
The way you're standing
really looks like a coach's stance.

807
00:49:00,210 --> 00:49:02,650
Let's go.
That one is pretty easy, so it's okay.

808
00:49:02,650 --> 00:49:05,210
[The attack succeeds!]

809
00:49:05,660 --> 00:49:07,500
[Loud cheers.]

810
00:49:08,660 --> 00:49:11,070
[Dramatically coming to a tied score.]

811
00:49:11,070 --> 00:49:14,390
- You have to attack, Ha Ha.
- Can I spin this around?

812
00:49:14,390 --> 00:49:17,260
- No, no! No, you can't.
- Ha Ha, go to the other side.

813
00:49:17,660 --> 00:49:20,780
[The match with one bead left
on each side]

814
00:49:20,780 --> 00:49:21,880
Tae Hwan...

815
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:30,640
The static...
it keeps getting staticky.

816
00:49:31,790 --> 00:49:35,170
- Attack it, that's right. It's the last one.
- You're going to be out, out.

817
00:49:35,170 --> 00:49:37,960
You're going to fling it out of there,
fling it out of there.

818
00:49:38,420 --> 00:49:44,830
[Just what...]

819
00:49:44,830 --> 00:49:46,430
[Attack misses!]

820
00:49:47,490 --> 00:49:49,400
[Green Team - Tae Hwan wins!]

821
00:49:51,510 --> 00:49:54,760
What the heck?
I thought you said you were confident!

822
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:58,410
Yeon Jae's on our team...
but why do you keep pushing her back?

823
00:49:58,410 --> 00:50:00,700
Come over this way, this way.

824
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:03,630
Let's leave the ramen out.
Ramen is for Yeon Jae...

825
00:50:03,630 --> 00:50:05,080
[Tae Hwan's consideration for Yeon Jae.]

826
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:10,150
Why? I want ramen...
[Gary wanting to eat his ramen...]

827
00:50:10,150 --> 00:50:12,530
- What should we do?
- Let's take the vegetables.

828
00:50:12,530 --> 00:50:15,610
- That's what we need.
- Just give us some plain rice.

829
00:50:16,710 --> 00:50:18,870
- You're really good!
- It's our turn this time, right?

830
00:50:18,870 --> 00:50:21,640
I'll take a chance.
[Red Team - Jae Suk]

831
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:24,340
Jae Suk this time...
you have to get the ramen this time.

832
00:50:24,340 --> 00:50:30,030
- No... Tae Hwan is on a real streak right now.
- We'll do the Rock-Paper-Scissors to start.

833
00:50:30,030 --> 00:50:33,740
- Rock-Paper-Scissors.
- Attack, Jae Suk. Start off attacking.

834
00:50:33,740 --> 00:50:35,840
- You have to take it out from the start.
- You have to win this time.

835
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:41,370
[Will it be the undisputed
Lord of catching up, Jae Suk...]

836
00:50:41,370 --> 00:50:50,310
[Or a world champion in the making,
Park Tae Hwan?]

837
00:50:51,030 --> 00:50:52,560
[Start of the showdown!]

838
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:59,080
It's going to fly off.
100% guaranteed, it's going to fly off.

839
00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:01,480
[Coach Kook and Coach Gae
mentally shaking him.]

840
00:51:05,740 --> 00:51:09,710
- Hurry! He's waiting for his turn!
- Wait... who the heck is Nala?

841
00:51:11,820 --> 00:51:15,880
- Go for the left one.
- Use the left to go for the middle one.

842
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:22,940
- That's right!
- Pass it, pass it, pass it.

843
00:51:22,940 --> 00:51:24,940
It passed!

844
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:27,910
[Complete success of Coach Kook
and Coach Gae's mental shakedown?]

845
00:51:28,690 --> 00:51:31,420
[Current score - 2:3]

846
00:51:31,420 --> 00:51:34,240
- Just tap the one in the middle.
- That's right. That was good.

847
00:51:34,580 --> 00:51:37,890
Kwang Soo...
attack is the best line of defense.

848
00:51:37,900 --> 00:51:41,290
That's right... it's going to fly off,
it's going to fly off.

849
00:51:43,670 --> 00:51:45,990
[Marine boy embarrassed of his
Coach Kook and Coach Gae?]

850

Olympic athlete gets the same pressure.

851
00:51:47,750 --> 00:51:50,200
[Ever untiring obstructive energy.]

852
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:52,490
Okay, that's good.
Let's go for a win.

853
00:51:52,490 --> 00:51:54,520
[A drastic order of attack.]

854
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:57,160
Go for that white one.
It'll be okay. Go for it.

855
00:51:57,170 --> 00:51:59,050
That's right!

856
00:52:00,630 --> 00:52:03,230
[Current score - 1:3.
Tae Hwan with the advantage!]

857
00:52:05,100 --> 00:52:07,530
[His behind...?]

858
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:15,750
What else am I supposed to do?
I only have one left!

859
00:52:15,750 --> 00:52:18,410
You're going to make Yeon Jae
uncomfortable.

860
00:52:18,410 --> 00:52:22,290
- It's going to fly off, it's going to fly off
- It's going to fall, it's going to fall.

861
00:52:23,090 --> 00:52:26,610
[Brimming over with confidence with his
behind style, he succeeds?]

863
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:33,570
That's right.
Let's go hit that one.

[Jae Suk's turn again]

865
00:52:36,910 --> 00:52:39,820
It's okay, it's going to fly off.
It's going to fly off.

866
00:52:39,820 --> 00:52:42,140
[The relentless obstruction engine.]

867
00:52:43,220 --> 00:52:44,890
I can't have a mental breakdown
right now.

868
00:52:44,890 --> 00:52:48,600
- It's going to fall off, fall off.
- You're going to hit it too hard, hit it hard.

869
00:52:49,210 --> 00:52:51,810
[Concentrating again and succeeding!]

870
00:52:52,370 --> 00:52:55,760
[Score is now even!]

871
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:58,970
[The win balances on the last bead...]

872
00:52:58,970 --> 00:53:01,030
<i>Hit it off the board.

[Overflowing joy from the victory.]

[Looks as though he may become a
world champion in Alkkagi too!]

877
00:53:19,420 --> 00:53:23,060
- What is this?
- Tae Hwan, what is this dance?

878
00:53:24,090 --> 00:53:26,660
He's way too good.
He's unbeatable.

879
00:53:26,670 --> 00:53:29,470
[Ultimately taking over
the rest of the ingredients]

880
00:53:29,470 --> 00:53:32,760
I think Tae Hwan realized too...
what support we are from the background.

881
00:53:33,390 --> 00:53:35,930
It really is...

882
00:53:35,930 --> 00:53:39,410
It's Park Tae Hwan who did a good job,
why are you taking the credit?

883
00:53:39,410 --> 00:53:43,080
I understand why coaches are so happy
when their athletes do well.

884
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:46,800
- That feeling.
- Wow... that really is awesome.

885
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:49,390
- Can we eat now?
- You may go ahead.

886
00:53:49,390 --> 00:53:50,510
[Green team with all the ingredients.]

887
00:53:55,770 --> 00:53:58,660
I apologize...
but we're going to go ahead and eat.

888
00:53:58,660 --> 00:54:00,490
That looks really good.

889
00:54:02,230 --> 00:54:04,720
[Red Team has ham stew.]

890
00:54:06,330 --> 00:54:07,860
- It's good.
- It's yummy.

891
00:54:07,860 --> 00:54:11,600
- This really is good even with just the ham.
- The broth itself is really good.

892
00:54:12,270 --> 00:54:13,520
This kimchee is really good too.

893
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:16,380
[Blue team without any ingredients puts in
their only side dish, the kimchee...]

894
00:54:20,930 --> 00:54:22,590
- What?
- What?

895
00:54:22,590 --> 00:54:24,590
- Why are you staring?
- I'm looking outside.

896
00:54:24,590 --> 00:54:25,950
- Really?
- Yeah.

897
00:54:25,950 --> 00:54:28,240
If ours is this good,
I wonder how good theirs is.

898
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:30,510
[Curious about the Green team's stew
with all the ingredients.]

899
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:38,230
[Even though he feels bad, a win is a win.]

900
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:44,080
[The winning Green team's choice is?]

901
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:46,940
[Return Tae Hwan's name tag
to its original size.]

902
00:54:48,550 --> 00:54:51,200
- How did you go around with this on your back?
- How did you stand it?

903
00:54:51,230 --> 00:54:53,160
[The next mission card...]

904
00:54:53,170 --> 00:54:57,600
[Go to the indoor ice rink in Uijeongbu
and find the Running Man landmark.]

905
00:54:57,600 --> 00:55:02,690
- I have a very good feeling right now.
- I feel much lighter right now.

906
00:55:02,690 --> 00:55:05,780
Wow... but we really did return your name tag
like we said we would. That's not easy to do.

907
00:55:05,780 --> 00:55:08,390
- I know.
- The truth is, we haven't done anything.

908
00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:10,670
- Tae Hwan did everything.
- No, I didn't.

909
00:55:10,670 --> 00:55:15,330
- I was so surprised, how are you so good?
- I was worried since I've never played before.

910
00:55:15,330 --> 00:55:19,560
- If you think positively, it happens.
- You're right, that's right.

911
00:55:20,230 --> 00:55:24,470
[I really learned a lot about
hope and affirmation this time.]

912
00:55:24,470 --> 00:55:26,670
You're right, Tae Hwan.

913
00:55:27,670 --> 00:55:32,280
[400m competition
Tae Hwan reaching first place with ease.]

914
00:55:33,310 --> 00:55:35,460
[But an absurd...]

915
00:55:35,460 --> 00:55:39,700
<i>Oh! Park Tae Hwan has been disqualified!
How did this happen?</i>

916
00:55:39,700 --> 00:55:43,490
<i>What is going on?
I think we need to look into this.</i>

917
00:55:43,490 --> 00:55:45,150
I haven't done anything wrong.

918
00:55:45,330 --> 00:55:48,880
Nothing was confirmed about what happened,
and something was off and strange.

919
00:55:49,360 --> 00:55:53,460
The truth is... there's never been
a reverse in scoring before.

920
00:55:53,460 --> 00:55:54,690
There's never been a history of it.

921
00:55:54,690 --> 00:55:58,820
- So you had hope that it wouldn't...
- Yes, I hadn't done anything wrong.

922
00:55:58,820 --> 00:56:04,660
So as soon as I was out, I watched the
video in case I did something wrong.

923
00:56:04,660 --> 00:56:07,630
- But... I didn't.
- You didn't make any mistakes?

924
00:56:09,850 --> 00:56:11,860
I don't know what's going on.

925
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:20,320
So we put our first formal objection in...
but they wouldn't accept it.

926
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:26,050
So with Director Michael and
Coach Duncan that I trained with in Australia

927
00:56:26,050 --> 00:56:30,050
I showed the video and kept pointing out
that I didn't do anything wrong.

928
00:56:30,970 --> 00:56:33,760
- So they accepted the 2nd formal objection?
- Yes, they accepted it at 3:30.

929
00:56:33,770 --> 00:56:38,050
I was originally told that I'd get an answer
by 2:30, so I waited up the whole time.

930
00:56:38,050 --> 00:56:40,890
I needed to manage my schedule...

931
00:56:41,650 --> 00:56:47,650
Even though I should've in preparation for
the next day, all I could do was wait.

932
00:56:49,260 --> 00:56:54,410
So I kept telling myself that things are
going to be fine and waited until 3:30.

933
00:56:54,750 --> 00:56:57,370
It was finally reversed at 3:30.

934
00:56:57,370 --> 00:57:00,520
Then normally...
once you finish the first round

935
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:04,800
what do you normally do until the next round?
What process do you go through?

936
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:08,460
Once the match is over and if I had won
to go on to the next round

937
00:57:08,460 --> 00:57:12,840
I would do the warm up again to
relax my muscles and get massages too...

938
00:57:13,160 --> 00:57:15,610
- and refuel myself with food too...
- Right, right...

939
00:57:15,790 --> 00:57:19,690
But the truth is...
I didn't have the motivation to do it.

940
00:57:19,690 --> 00:57:24,970
When Tae Hwan came on for the finals,
I could tell by the expression on his face...

941
00:57:24,970 --> 00:57:28,920
Like he wanted to show them something...
like 'you all just wait and see.'

942
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:33,970
[Only with firm resolution and mentality,
Tae Hwan was able to stand again at the line.]

943
00:57:35,940 --> 00:57:39,200
[And his energetic performance...]

944
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:41,330
<i>His start is very good.</i>

945
00:57:42,080 --> 00:57:45,410
Based on that situation,
the score I received was so valuable.

946
00:57:46,730 --> 00:57:51,300
After seeing that, I drank so much
that I didn't even get to watch the results.

947
00:57:52,310 --> 00:57:55,590
[The nausea induced by drinking...]

948
00:57:58,040 --> 00:58:00,060
[Proud of you, Marine boy...]

949
00:58:00,890 --> 00:58:03,760
[Green team is the first to arrive
at the ice rink.]

950
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:05,460
I think this is it.

951
00:58:07,710 --> 00:58:10,770
[What training will happen
at the ice rink in this late summer?]

952
00:58:11,700 --> 00:58:13,540
- Hello.
- Hi.

953
00:58:13,540 --> 00:58:15,800
Go home and study.

954
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:21,990
[First entering the rink in warmer clothing.]

955
00:58:25,770 --> 00:58:29,020
[There seems to be quite a crowd
gathered here to watch.]

956
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:36,300
[Countless people who came to watch
after hearing of the world stars' training.]

957
00:58:40,070 --> 00:58:41,890
<i>Kim Jong Kook!</i>

958
00:58:43,510 --> 00:58:48,570
[A sincere greeting to all the fans that
came out to greet them enthusiastically.]

959
00:58:52,650 --> 00:58:54,910
[The red team also arrives soon thereafter.]

960
00:58:55,860 --> 00:58:59,370
[An even more enthusiastic crowd
with the arrival of the gymnastics fairy!]

961
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:03,070
[I'm here too.]

962
00:59:04,410 --> 00:59:06,820
<i>[Yoo Jae Suk! Yoo Jae Suk!]</i>

[Marine Boy going along with the beat.]

964
00:59:10,010 --> 00:59:13,370
[Thank you for your enthusiastic greeting.]

965
00:59:14,790 --> 00:59:16,880
<i>As mentioned,
this is your winter training.</i>

966
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:20,480
<i>The game is, human curling.</i>

967
00:59:21,930 --> 00:59:26,820
<i>Two people get in the buckets,
and one person pushes.</i>

968
00:59:26,830 --> 00:59:32,330
<i>The team that gets closest to the
finish line at the end is the winner.</i>

969
00:59:32,330 --> 00:59:36,370
<i>Since the Green team arrived here first,
they'll walk over to the second round.</i>

970
00:59:36,990 --> 00:59:38,260
Let's go!

971
00:59:38,260 --> 00:59:40,580
<i>Please decide which team
will push first.</i>

972
00:59:40,580 --> 00:59:44,080
- We'll go later.
- No, we'll go later.

973
00:59:44,090 --> 00:59:46,610
- How do we decide this?
- Let's play Rock-Paper-Scissors.

974
00:59:46,610 --> 00:59:48,540
- Yeon Jae.
- Rock-Paper-Scissors.

975
00:59:48,540 --> 00:59:50,590
[Yeon Jae easily succeeds.]

976
00:59:51,630 --> 00:59:54,640
- All three people should do it.
- Let's just end it with one person.

977
00:59:56,080 --> 00:59:58,940
If you were going to be like this,
you should've given Yeon Jae an autograph.

978
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:01,570
I gave you an autograph, right?

979
01:00:03,940 --> 01:00:06,050
- Where was it?
- It was at her elementary school.

980
01:00:06,050 --> 01:00:10,300
[Coach Kook stepping in since the
decision is taking too long.]

981
01:00:10,540 --> 01:00:12,340
Let's do this quickly!

982
01:00:18,390 --> 01:00:23,180
[Slipping in front of the whole crowd!]

983
01:00:23,180 --> 01:00:24,740
That really hurts!

984
01:00:25,060 --> 01:00:28,990
[In situations like this, the
embarrassment comes before pain.]

985
01:00:28,990 --> 01:00:32,340
- Applaud!
- It's okay, it's okay...

986
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:36,800
[A rare moment of seeing
Mr. Capable fall.]

987
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:38,300
This is nerve-wrecking.

988
01:00:38,300 --> 01:00:42,380
It's nerve wrecking enough with just us,
but it's more so with all these people here.

989
01:00:42,940 --> 01:00:45,370
- Fighting!
- Applaud!

990
01:00:48,790 --> 01:00:50,960
[Conceding - Red Team first to step up.
First up is Yeon Jae.]

991
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:55,000
[The other two have to push the bin to
get it close to the line when they stop.]

992
01:00:55,740 --> 01:00:58,510
[Allowed to use props to help
the bin slide.]

993
01:00:58,520 --> 01:01:00,580
<i>You have to do it from the front.</i>

994
01:01:00,580 --> 01:01:05,430
[Red team Yeon Jae - Start!]

995
01:01:07,130 --> 01:01:09,060
That was too strong!

996
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:17,390
[Before the bucket stops,
start working the ice!]

997
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:24,930
[Approaching the finish line!]

998
01:01:25,480 --> 01:01:31,400
[Just how close to the finish line will the
gymnastics fairy be able to stop?]

999
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:38,310
[Wow! Amazing!]

1000
01:01:42,840 --> 01:01:45,830
[Precisely on top of the finish line!]

1001
01:01:46,180 --> 01:01:49,370
[Red team dominating with
their first attempt with Yeon Jae.]

1002
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:54,130
- Didn't they go over the line?
- If Yeon Jae goes over a little, it's over.

1003
01:01:54,130 --> 01:01:55,920
[Green team's athlete and the coaches falling
into the competitive mode right away.]

1004
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:58,010
What do I do now?

1005
01:01:58,270 --> 01:02:01,140
When they get close to you,
push them off lightly with your feet.

1006
01:02:01,140 --> 01:02:06,460
If they come close, don't feel bad
and push them off with your feet.

1007
01:02:06,460 --> 01:02:07,930
Get them with your feet!

1008
01:02:09,190 --> 01:02:12,170
[Blue team's first up is Ace Ji Hyo!]

1009
01:02:13,940 --> 01:02:16,120
[An energetic start.]

1010
01:02:17,110 --> 01:02:19,550
[It's starting off smoothly...]

1011
01:02:22,090 --> 01:02:25,520
[He should've just stood still,
why be a nuisance?]

1012
01:02:26,270 --> 01:02:27,600
Suk Jin!

1013
01:02:28,760 --> 01:02:31,300
What are you doing? Suk Jin!

1014
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:34,540
Hurry up and push her!

1015
01:02:36,170 --> 01:02:38,590
[Ji Hyo, needs to slide over a little more...]

1016
01:02:41,300 --> 01:02:43,400
[Nuisance to the end.]

1017
01:02:44,270 --> 01:02:48,560
[Ultimately stopping
far away from the finish line.]

1018
01:02:50,570 --> 01:02:52,160
What is this?

1019
01:02:52,810 --> 01:02:54,440
Just what is this?

1020
01:02:54,440 --> 01:02:56,050
What is this?

1021
01:02:56,640 --> 01:02:59,010
[This time, it's the
Red team's second runner's turn]

1022
01:03:00,490 --> 01:03:03,080
[The second runner is Yoo-Ruce Willis.]

1023
01:03:04,030 --> 01:03:07,810
<i>Yoo Jae Suk, Yoo Jae Suk!</i>

1024
01:03:07,810 --> 01:03:09,400
[Advantageous to protect Yeon Jae
and kick Ji Hyo out of the way.]

1025
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:12,560
<i>Hey, Ji Hyo!
Push him out of the way!</i>

1026
01:03:12,570 --> 01:03:14,150
<i>Push him and push yourself
in the process.</i>

1027
01:03:16,990 --> 01:03:20,590
[Heading straight towards Ji Hyo!]

1028
01:03:25,240 --> 01:03:29,050
[Push her out?]

1029
01:03:29,470 --> 01:03:33,770
[Ace Ji Hyo grabbing onto him!]

1030
01:03:39,610 --> 01:03:43,100
[With savvy planning, pushing herself
right onto the finish line!]

1031
01:03:45,560 --> 01:03:48,340
[That is Ace Ji Hyo!]

1032
01:03:48,340 --> 01:03:52,340
[Red team's Yeon Jae and Blue team's Ji Hyo
currently almost at the same spot]

1033
01:03:52,450 --> 01:03:55,200
[While the competition
for the win is going on.]

1034
01:03:59,300 --> 01:04:05,190
[Giraffe using the interlude
for his ice ballet show.]

1035
01:04:05,740 --> 01:04:08,980
[It's beautiful...]

1036
01:04:12,110 --> 01:04:14,320
[But that's enough.]

1037
01:04:19,600 --> 01:04:21,500
[Second runner for the Blue team
is Big-nosed brother.]

1038
01:04:21,510 --> 01:04:23,770
<i>- Over here, over here.
- Be careful, Yeon Jae!</i>

1039
01:04:23,770 --> 01:04:27,530
- What do I have to do?
- Push him away with your foot.

1040
01:04:27,530 --> 01:04:30,300
- Then I'll be pushed off the line.
- That's true...

1041
01:04:33,570 --> 01:04:35,010
<i>Yeon Jae, I'm sorry!</i>

1042
01:04:35,010 --> 01:04:36,890
<i>I'm going to attack you!</i>

1043
01:04:36,890 --> 01:04:39,770
[Big-nosed brother looking to come out
attacking Yeon Jae]

1044
01:04:39,770 --> 01:04:41,910
Nothing else to do but push me
really hard.

1045
01:04:42,550 --> 01:04:45,340
- Push me hard towards Yeon Jae.
- I'm really scared.

1046
01:04:46,040 --> 01:04:49,480
[Big-nosed brother headed
straight towards Yeon Jae!]

1047
01:04:52,490 --> 01:04:56,880
[If he could push Yeon Jae off the line,
then the Blue team goes to the next round!]

1048
01:04:57,450 --> 01:04:59,880
[He's going!]

1049
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:06,540
[Ah! He pushed Yeon Jae off!]

1050
01:05:09,270 --> 01:05:12,690
[Only Ji Hyo remains
directly on top of the finish line.]

1051
01:05:13,500 --> 01:05:19,300
[Pushed precisely...
and pushed off precisely]

1052
01:05:19,310 --> 01:05:22,100
[Blue team off to the next round!]

1053
01:05:28,530 --> 01:05:30,170
Yeon Jae says she wants to
try it too.

1054
01:05:30,180 --> 01:05:33,320
Yeon Jae's putting the knee-pads on
because she wants to try it too.

1055
01:05:34,420 --> 01:05:35,660
Is it fun?

1056
01:05:35,660 --> 01:05:37,510
It's totally fun.

1057
01:05:37,510 --> 01:05:39,670
[Smiling at the thought of
playing around.]

1058
01:05:39,670 --> 01:05:43,470
- Try it. Just kneel down.
- Just kneel down.

1059
01:05:49,850 --> 01:05:51,250
Isn't it fun?

1060
01:05:53,670 --> 01:05:54,850
You have to fling your arms back.

1061
01:05:57,640 --> 01:05:59,440
What do I do? I can't stop.

1062
01:06:00,250 --> 01:06:01,650
I can't stop.

1063
01:06:02,430 --> 01:06:04,070
What are you so happy about?

1064
01:06:04,070 --> 01:06:06,020
You're liking it too much!

1065
01:06:06,020 --> 01:06:07,960
[Embarrassed...]

1066
01:06:09,490 --> 01:06:13,330
[Curling - Final Match]
[Blue team vs. Green team]

1067
01:06:13,330 --> 01:06:18,150
[Coach Kook and Athlete Park
in the midst of strategizing.]

1068
01:06:18,150 --> 01:06:22,940
[Will they be able to pull off a miracle like
with Alkkagi a little while earlier?]

1069
01:06:23,700 --> 01:06:25,760
[First runner for the Green team
is Gary.]

1070
01:06:26,500 --> 01:06:28,920
[Starting off with caution.]

1071
01:06:29,780 --> 01:06:32,320
<i>Kang Gary! Kang Gary!</i>

1072
01:06:33,270 --> 01:06:34,830
Good, good.

1073
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:41,390
[Mr. Capable is definitely weak
when it comes to ice...]

1074
01:06:44,300 --> 01:06:45,900
[So embarrassing.]

1075
01:06:47,180 --> 01:06:50,500
[Stopping at rather a far distance
away from the finish line.]

1076
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:55,310
- Are you doing that on purpose?
- Are you falling down on purpose?

1077
01:06:55,310 --> 01:06:57,400
I thought you were
a spinning top or something.

1078
01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:03,380
[Tiger loses his strength if
he strays too far from earthen soil.]

1079
01:07:03,380 --> 01:07:04,580
This is really driving me crazy.

1080
01:07:06,060 --> 01:07:07,820
Wait here.
I'll go tell him what to do.

1081
01:07:09,850 --> 01:07:12,950
[Athlete Park's coaching time.]

1082
01:07:13,370 --> 01:07:14,660
Grab onto her and spin yourself.

1083
01:07:14,660 --> 01:07:19,950
As soon as she gets close enough to you,
grab onto her and push yourself off.

1084
01:07:19,950 --> 01:07:22,090
[It looks like Ji Hyo's
heading from the Blue team.]

1085
01:07:22,090 --> 01:07:24,370
Tae Hwan, I'm pretty weak
when it comes to Ji Hyo.

1086
01:07:27,480 --> 01:07:30,510
[Blue team's first runner, Ace Ji Hyo.]

1087
01:07:34,560 --> 01:07:37,340
Hard, hard. In his direction.
Nice!

1088
01:07:37,340 --> 01:07:39,310
<i>Hard, hard. In his direction.
Nice!</i>

1089
01:07:39,310 --> 01:07:41,690
<i>- Nice!
- Grab her! Grab her!</i>

1090
01:07:41,690 --> 01:07:44,430
[Heading straight towards Gary!]
What?

1091
01:07:51,450 --> 01:07:56,610
[These two getting up close for the
first time in a long time.]

1092
01:07:58,090 --> 01:08:01,890
[Holding on tightly to her wrists.]

1093
01:08:01,890 --> 01:08:04,560
I'm going to stay next to you.
I'm going to stay right next to you!

1094
01:08:05,240 --> 01:08:07,680
[Now it's Gary
who's close to the finish line!]

1095
01:08:07,690 --> 01:08:10,760
I did it because I wanted to
keep her right next to me!

1096
01:08:12,350 --> 01:08:15,000
<i>You're not supposed to
grab like that!</i>

1097
01:08:16,440 --> 01:08:18,420
[So what?]

1098
01:08:20,290 --> 01:08:22,040
The last one is what's important.

1099
01:08:24,970 --> 01:08:28,430
[Coach Kook and Athlete Park
in a strategizing session again.]

1100
01:08:28,430 --> 01:08:31,880
- The other team is going to try to push...
- Aren't you guys taking too long?

1101
01:08:33,490 --> 01:08:36,280
- Jong Kook...
- Is this the Olympics or something?

1102
01:08:36,740 --> 01:08:37,790
What's taking you so long?

1103
01:08:37,790 --> 01:08:40,050
It's because I have a lot of resentment
over the Olympics right now!

1104
01:08:41,160 --> 01:08:43,030
Just leave us alone!

1105
01:08:43,430 --> 01:08:45,580
[Ah, yes...]

1106
01:08:45,580 --> 01:08:47,800
I finally found someone who
I can relate to!

1107
01:08:47,800 --> 01:08:50,530
[Coach Kook finally meeting
his soul mate.]

1108
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:55,740
You two really do fit each other well.

1109
01:08:55,740 --> 01:08:57,320
[Competitiveness and quick temper
all match each other very well.]

1110
01:08:59,720 --> 01:09:00,970
<i>Hey!</i>

1111
01:09:02,430 --> 01:09:05,750
[Continuing with the strategizing
instead of the actual competition.]

1112
01:09:06,360 --> 01:09:11,280
[Even though they say they get it,
going back to whispering...]

1113
01:09:15,420 --> 01:09:16,500
<i>That's good.</i>

1114
01:09:16,510 --> 01:09:20,170
[Finally, the Green team's second runner
Jong Kook gets on his way!]

1115
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:24,340
[Huh? Heading towards Gary?]

1116
01:09:26,150 --> 01:09:27,870
Push me, push me! Okay.

1117
01:09:30,830 --> 01:09:33,550
[With Gary's push,
right on top of the finish line!]

1118
01:09:33,550 --> 01:09:36,520
Why? Where do you want to go?
Why are you doing this?

1119
01:09:39,390 --> 01:09:42,420
You can't turn yourself around!
You can't turn!

1120
01:09:42,420 --> 01:09:46,000
<i>- He can! He can!
- What do you mean, he can?</i>

1121
01:09:47,910 --> 01:09:49,650
- He can't!
- He can! He can!

1122
01:09:49,650 --> 01:09:57,060
<i>- He can't! He can't!
- He can! He can!</i>

1123
01:09:59,910 --> 01:10:02,650
- We're saying he can't!
- We're saying he can!

1124
01:10:08,300 --> 01:10:10,710
[Anyways, the last runner for the
Blue team, Big-nosed brother.]

1125
01:10:10,710 --> 01:10:12,910
Just push.
Mr. Capable, you just wait!

1126
01:10:13,810 --> 01:10:17,370
[With this one push, the winner for
Winter Training will be decided!]

1127
01:10:17,990 --> 01:10:20,430
Let's go, let's go. Straight!
Okay! Good!

1128
01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:26,190
[If he can only push off Mr. Capable,
it's victory!]

1129
01:10:26,510 --> 01:10:29,240
[The goal!]

1130
01:10:29,240 --> 01:10:31,390
- You got it, you got it!
- You're going to get it!

1131
01:10:34,870 --> 01:10:37,160
[Big-nosed brother vs. Mr. Capable]

1132
01:10:43,260 --> 01:10:46,350
[Mr. Capable's attempt at defense
knocks both of them down?]

1133
01:10:46,350 --> 01:10:48,980
<i>We won! We won!</i>

1134
01:10:49,210 --> 01:10:53,510
[In this case,
how is a winner judged?]

1135
01:10:54,620 --> 01:10:57,390
[A quick announcement of the results.]

1136
01:10:57,390 --> 01:10:59,310
[Suk Jin and Jong kook both disqualified
for falling out of the buckets.]

1137
01:10:59,310 --> 01:11:02,490
<i>Ji Hyo is closest to the line.</i>

1138
01:11:03,950 --> 01:11:07,010
[The Blue team wins the winter training!]

1139
01:11:07,910 --> 01:11:11,070
[Looks as though the winning team is
going to make someone's name tag bigger.]

1140
01:11:11,080 --> 01:11:12,340
We're going to make Kim Jong Kook's
name tag larger.

1141
01:11:12,340 --> 01:11:14,610
- Wait a minute...
- We're going to make Kim Jong Kook's larger.

1142
01:11:15,640 --> 01:11:16,770
What?

1143
01:11:16,930 --> 01:11:20,120
The truth is... Yeon Jae kept
hoping for that in the car too.

1144
01:11:22,940 --> 01:11:26,650
[Jong Kooks name tag gets exchanged
for the gigantic one]

1145
01:11:28,590 --> 01:11:30,160
<i>Yeon Jae, you can rip it off later.</i>

1146
01:11:38,180 --> 01:11:39,700
You can fly off.

1147
01:11:39,900 --> 01:11:43,500
[Will his wings make him fly,
or will they get broken off?]

1148
01:11:46,420 --> 01:11:52,350
[The last training camp,
'H' Island in Pocheon.]

1149
01:11:52,350 --> 01:11:55,380
[What will be the mission here
to decide the victor?]

1150
01:11:55,380 --> 01:11:57,410
Running Man's training camp.

1151
01:11:57,410 --> 01:11:58,660
[Ripping off the name tag.]

1152
01:11:58,660 --> 01:12:03,620
[Find the water bottle and exchange
it for 00 at the witches' house]

1153
01:12:04,790 --> 01:12:09,460
[Find the water bottle and
exchange it.]

1154
01:12:09,460 --> 01:12:12,480
I'm going to have to find it no matter what.
I think it can change our name tag size.

1155
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:14,980
- Where are the water bottles?
- You want us to find the water bottles?

1156
01:12:15,970 --> 01:12:21,440
[The bottom line is to rip off the name tags.
The team to survive to the end wins.]

1157
01:12:21,450 --> 01:12:24,380
<i>However,
when you find the water bottle...</i>

1158
01:12:25,820 --> 01:12:27,280
Excuse me...

1159
01:12:27,440 --> 01:12:29,430
Who were you just shooting?

1160
01:12:30,310 --> 01:12:34,150
[Jae Suk's VJ, Kwon Yeol
is only shooting Yeon Jae.]

1161
01:12:34,150 --> 01:12:35,840
Who were you just shooting?

1162
01:12:36,580 --> 01:12:41,140
[Even though he gets scolded,
the camera goes back to Yeon Jae.]

1163
01:12:43,310 --> 01:12:44,300
Seriously...

1164
01:12:44,300 --> 01:12:46,700
You really shouldn't be doing that
with your wedding coming up.

1165
01:12:47,010 --> 01:12:49,770
- Just because she's on...
- That's no good.

1166
01:12:50,210 --> 01:12:52,970
[But still, only Yeon Jae...]

1167
01:12:53,910 --> 01:12:58,580
[Before going around ripping off name tags,
find the mysterious water bottles first.]

1168
01:12:58,580 --> 01:13:01,020
You can be ousted quickly today.

1169
01:13:02,970 --> 01:13:04,850
No matter what,
we'll make you the winner today.

1170
01:13:04,850 --> 01:13:06,830
Where were we supposed to go
with the water bottles?

1171
01:13:06,830 --> 01:13:10,290
- The witches house...
- We're supposed to exchange it for something.

1172
01:13:10,290 --> 01:13:12,670
Exchange it for something
with the witch, right?

1173
01:13:14,340 --> 01:13:15,900
<i>Where are these water bottles?</i>

1174
01:13:19,860 --> 01:13:21,320
No!

1175
01:13:22,040 --> 01:13:24,280
No! You startled me!

1176
01:13:25,430 --> 01:13:27,150
You really scared me!

1177
01:13:29,640 --> 01:13:31,550
[So cute!]

1178
01:13:32,180 --> 01:13:35,420
You scared me...
you really scared me!

1179
01:13:36,550 --> 01:13:39,730
- So this is how it's done...
- Yeah, you have to be careful.

1180
01:13:40,440 --> 01:13:43,110
Are the water bottles hidden
just anywhere?

1181
01:13:43,110 --> 01:13:46,500
- They're just hidden anywhere?
- They should be around here somewhere.

1182
01:13:46,500 --> 01:13:49,050
- This one? This?
- Seriously?

1183
01:13:49,050 --> 01:13:51,390
[That's a plain water bottle...]

1184
01:13:51,390 --> 01:13:52,720
That's just a real water bottle.

1185
01:13:53,190 --> 01:13:57,100
- So what am I looking for?
- It'll be like a magic water bottle.

1186
01:13:57,680 --> 01:13:59,660
The herbal scent is so nice.

1187
01:13:59,670 --> 01:14:01,890
Look at all the herbs here!

1188
01:14:03,310 --> 01:14:05,960
I'm getting a feeling here.
Wow... look at all this.

1189
01:14:06,520 --> 01:14:11,020
Suk Jin... it's all over!
Water bottles are all over!

1190
01:14:12,470 --> 01:14:15,310
[Water bottles all over the place.]

1191
01:14:15,310 --> 01:14:17,710
What is this?
Water bottles are everywhere!

1192
01:14:20,290 --> 01:14:21,830
I'm going to have to find it quickly.

1193
01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:24,470
I'm sure there's one here.
I'm sure of it.

1194
01:14:26,380 --> 01:14:30,410
[Yeon Jae is searching at the bakery.]

1195
01:14:30,410 --> 01:14:31,570
There's nothing here.

1196
01:14:34,300 --> 01:14:35,550
What's this?

1197
01:14:36,400 --> 01:14:39,470
[A suspicious chest under the bread?]

1198
01:14:39,470 --> 01:14:43,860
[A treasure chest?
Then does it mean there's a bottle inside?]

1199
01:14:46,940 --> 01:14:49,070
Is this a dud?

1200
01:14:54,240 --> 01:14:58,100
[Ha Ha's carrying around
a treasure chest too...]

1201
01:14:58,110 --> 01:15:00,470
We're on the same side.
You can have this.

1202
01:15:01,020 --> 01:15:04,510
[Huh? Handing it off to Giraffe
so easily like that?]

1203
01:15:04,510 --> 01:15:05,850
We are one.

1204
01:15:05,860 --> 01:15:07,920
- Thank you, Ha Ha.
- It's been awhile.

1205
01:15:08,440 --> 01:15:10,410
Bye, (traitor) believer.

1206
01:15:10,410 --> 01:15:15,020
We're of the same.
The name is... (Traitor) Believer.

1207
01:15:15,020 --> 01:15:17,410
- Believer, see you later.
- Okay, Ha Ha.

1208
01:15:17,410 --> 01:15:20,100
[Experts of betrayal and political games
are going to work together?]

1209
01:15:20,100 --> 01:15:21,840
Shin-Ja-Cross!

1210
01:15:24,230 --> 01:15:25,750
<i>[Dud]</i>

1211
01:15:27,490 --> 01:15:29,920
[That's more like it...]

1212
01:15:31,240 --> 01:15:35,450
[Icons of betrayal acknowledging
one another.]

1213
01:15:35,840 --> 01:15:37,190
Hello.

1214
01:15:38,320 --> 01:15:39,930
- You're here.
- Hello.

1215
01:15:39,930 --> 01:15:43,860
[Stopping their awful behavior with
the appearance of innocent Yeon Jae.]

1216
01:15:43,860 --> 01:15:46,630
- I found this.
- I found it too, but it was a dud.

1217
01:15:46,630 --> 01:15:49,030
Really? Then I'll see you later,
Yeon Jae.

1218
01:15:49,030 --> 01:15:52,150
- Okay.
- Believer... see you later.

1219
01:15:52,590 --> 01:15:54,560
[You just wait and see.]

1220
01:15:55,910 --> 01:15:57,840
Just where the heck is it?

1221
01:16:06,570 --> 01:16:07,580
Where are you going?

1222
01:16:07,580 --> 01:16:09,280
It would probably be better not to
acknowledge each other for the time being.

1223
01:16:10,150 --> 01:16:12,020
Where are you going, little groom?

1224
01:16:12,420 --> 01:16:14,440
I'm going to the herb garden, why?

1225
01:16:14,440 --> 01:16:16,730
- Really?
- No, no.

1226
01:16:16,730 --> 01:16:18,540
- I'll go on my own.
- I'll come too.

1227
01:16:18,540 --> 01:16:20,830
- Why don't you go over there?
- Since I've already been there, I'll go here.

1228
01:16:21,370 --> 01:16:24,910
- I was the one who came here first.
- You...

1229
01:16:25,320 --> 01:16:27,550
Would you like to come with me,
or should I go on by myself?

1230
01:16:27,950 --> 01:16:30,200
I'm going to go by myself.
Wait...

1231
01:16:31,740 --> 01:16:35,460
[Ultimately going up together...]

1232
01:16:36,830 --> 01:16:38,860
Oh my goodness! Here!
It's here!

1233
01:16:43,130 --> 01:16:45,760
[This is...]

1234
01:16:46,310 --> 01:16:49,890
[where a 600 year-old witch...]

1235
01:16:49,890 --> 01:16:53,950
[...performs magic with
the mysterious water bottles.]

1236
01:16:54,720 --> 01:16:57,730
[This is the witches' house.]

1237
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:01,410
So this is where we bring the water?

1238
01:17:01,410 --> 01:17:03,910
- Scary...
- What are you doing, Dong Wan?

1239
01:17:05,420 --> 01:17:07,860
- Go find the potion.
- So this is it.

1240
01:17:07,870 --> 01:17:10,100
- What happens when we find it?
- So this is the place.

1241
01:17:10,100 --> 01:17:12,990
[Anyways, these two have found the
location of the witch's house.]

1242
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:14,860
Is there only one potion?

1243
01:17:15,380 --> 01:17:16,770
I'm sure you'll find that out
once you find any.

1244
01:17:18,490 --> 01:17:25,060
[Something will happen here if they bring
the mysterious water bottles.]

1245
01:17:27,770 --> 01:17:30,840
[On the other hand, at the same time...]

1246
01:17:30,840 --> 01:17:34,630
[Giraffe working hard to find
the mysterious water bottles.]

1247
01:17:39,470 --> 01:17:42,540
[Discovers a deeply hidden
treasure chest!]

1248
01:17:47,920 --> 01:17:51,950
[There it is!
The mysterious water bottle!]

1249
01:17:56,660 --> 01:17:58,140
Did you find it?

1250
01:17:58,140 --> 01:18:00,410
Did you find it?
Did you find it?

1251
01:18:00,410 --> 01:18:01,930
[I found it.]

1252
01:18:03,350 --> 01:18:08,350
[Giraffe feeling as though
he's taken over the world.]

1253
01:18:10,620 --> 01:18:11,960
Did you find it?

1254
01:18:13,160 --> 01:18:15,130
[Water bottle with blue liquid inside.]

1255
01:18:15,960 --> 01:18:17,110
Where are we going?

1256
01:18:17,110 --> 01:18:18,830
What did I tell you, Yeon Jae?
I told you that I'd make you win.

1257
01:18:18,830 --> 01:18:20,230
Fighting.

1258
01:18:20,820 --> 01:18:23,090
[They have to hurry and take it
to the witch's house...]

1259
01:18:23,090 --> 01:18:25,620
- You know where to take this?
- Over there... second floor?

1260
01:18:26,960 --> 01:18:28,760
- Where?
- Come here.

1261
01:18:28,760 --> 01:18:31,230
Can we all go together?

1262
01:18:33,180 --> 01:18:34,680
I feel so weird!

1263
01:18:35,280 --> 01:18:38,930
[Giraffe feeling high-spirited after
finding the water bottle.]

1264
01:18:38,930 --> 01:18:41,220
I haven't found any chests.

1265
01:18:41,780 --> 01:18:44,580
I wasn't like this from the beginning either.
A year... or two...

1266
01:18:44,580 --> 01:18:46,600
And ultimately, this is how...

1267
01:18:46,600 --> 01:18:51,230
[Giraffe wanting to look like a man
in front of Yeon Jae.]

1268
01:18:53,880 --> 01:18:56,420
[Has no one found any water bottles yet?]

1269
01:18:57,810 --> 01:18:59,660
- Oh my goodness...
- What is this?

1270
01:18:59,670 --> 01:19:02,730
[All of Red team members arrive
at the witch's house.]

1271
01:19:02,730 --> 01:19:04,790
- You're here.
- I found the mysterious potion.

1272
01:19:04,790 --> 01:19:06,370
You can pour it in here.

1273
01:19:06,590 --> 01:19:07,970
Yeon Jae...

1274
01:19:07,970 --> 01:19:11,370
[Yeon Jae fascinated by PD Dong Wan
whom she's only seen on TV.]

1275
01:19:12,280 --> 01:19:14,210
- What is it?
- Which bottle did you find?

1276
01:19:14,360 --> 01:19:16,680
- It's the blue liquid.
- The blue liquid? Give it to me.

1277
01:19:17,870 --> 01:19:20,190
- Your acting's gotten much better.
- This is so funny.

1278
01:19:20,590 --> 01:19:23,010
You were so bad in the beginning.

1279
01:19:23,580 --> 01:19:26,270
- Okay, I'll make it for you.
- What? Make what?

1280
01:19:28,110 --> 01:19:32,060
[The cauldron changing to a blue hue!]

1281
01:19:32,060 --> 01:19:36,210
- I made this about 300 years ago...
- What a joke!

1282
01:19:36,210 --> 01:19:37,750
<i>What a joke.</i>

1283
01:19:38,520 --> 01:19:40,620
Throw in a snake...

1284
01:19:40,620 --> 01:19:44,820
- What are you doing?
- And a frog...

1285
01:19:44,830 --> 01:19:46,630
Just hold on.

1286
01:19:47,210 --> 01:19:48,870
I'm making it right now.

1287
01:20:00,160 --> 01:20:05,360
[Just what will the blue potion be
made into?]

1288
01:20:14,990 --> 01:20:18,480
[A gigantic name tag!]

1289
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:22,790
[This is the power of the blue potion.]

1290
01:20:28,310 --> 01:20:33,450
[The short lived excitement...
what the heck is this?]

1291
01:20:33,450 --> 01:20:36,040
- I'm ruined.
- We need to find another one for Kwang Soo.

1292
01:20:36,680 --> 01:20:41,780
[Giraffe with wings...
what will become of his fate?]

1293
01:20:42,050 --> 01:20:45,080
[On the other hand,
the Tiger with wings...]

1294
01:20:45,080 --> 01:20:49,030
[In the midst of having
a conversation with the birds.]

1295
01:20:49,720 --> 01:20:52,190
There's a mirror in there too.
They must look in the mirror.

1296
01:20:54,240 --> 01:20:57,100
Where is Jong Kook with
his big wings?

1297
01:20:57,110 --> 01:20:58,760
Hey!

1298
01:20:58,760 --> 01:21:00,400
Oh! There's Jong Kook!

1299
01:21:01,590 --> 01:21:04,370
- I've been all over the place.
- We haven't found any.

1300
01:21:04,370 --> 01:21:05,490
There's nothing.

1301
01:21:05,490 --> 01:21:08,020
I've searched down there
and all the way up there too.

1302
01:21:08,020 --> 01:21:10,440
But I ran into Kwang Soo,
so I ran out of there.

1303
01:21:11,470 --> 01:21:12,650
There's nothing over there.

1304
01:21:12,660 --> 01:21:15,680
I never even dreamed that I would be
running away from Kwang Soo.

1305
01:21:15,680 --> 01:21:19,800
Walking around with this by myself
was really scary.

1306
01:21:20,390 --> 01:21:22,520
Seriously, this is the first time
I've felt this way.

1307
01:21:22,520 --> 01:21:24,360
Don't do that and
just follow behind us.

1308
01:21:25,920 --> 01:21:28,580
Even a tiger who's lost all its teeth
is still a tiger.

1309
01:21:31,260 --> 01:21:34,890
- That's right.
- No matter how Impala and the Giraffe...

1310
01:21:36,170 --> 01:21:38,870
- Even the tiger without its teeth...
- The important thing is...

1311
01:21:38,870 --> 01:21:41,060
Somehow all of a sudden,
I'm leading our group right now.

1312
01:21:41,060 --> 01:21:45,340
[The only realistic pillar today
is Tae Hwan.]

1313
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:49,590
There he is... there he is.

1314
01:21:50,680 --> 01:21:51,840
<i>He's on the boat.</i>

1315
01:21:52,320 --> 01:21:53,750
<i>Look at Kwang Soo's name tag!</i>

1316
01:21:53,750 --> 01:21:55,680
<i>Kwang Soo's name tag is
bigger now too!</i>

1317
01:21:56,220 --> 01:21:58,260
<i>He found the wrong bottle!</i>

1318
01:21:58,260 --> 01:22:02,110
<i>So inside those chests must be
name tags!</i>

1319
01:22:02,620 --> 01:22:05,360
- Don't open those chests then, I'll open it.
- Okay.

1320
01:22:07,790 --> 01:22:09,660
Be careful, Kwang Soo.
Be careful.

1321
01:22:09,660 --> 01:22:11,240
Kwang Soo, be careful.

1322
01:22:12,060 --> 01:22:15,240
[Green team eyeing Kwang Soo
and closing in on him.]

1323
01:22:16,040 --> 01:22:19,810
[Since they're already in this state,
thinking of eliminating Kwang Soo first.]

1324
01:22:25,150 --> 01:22:27,800
[If I stay like this, I'll be caught!]

1325
01:22:27,810 --> 01:22:31,710
Kwang Soo... before you're
caught, run. Run! Run!

1326
01:22:33,770 --> 01:22:35,970
Kwang Soo! Kwang Soo! Run!

1327
01:22:36,960 --> 01:22:40,390
[Tae Hwan starting to chase
after Kwang Soo!]

1328
01:22:42,080 --> 01:22:47,940
[The ultimate speed out of anyone
who's guest appeared on Running Man!]

1329
01:22:48,430 --> 01:22:50,530
<i>Kwang Soo! Run quickly!
Kwang Soo!</i>

1330
01:22:58,310 --> 01:22:59,820
<i>- Kwang Soo!
- Jae Suk!</i>

1331
01:23:00,420 --> 01:23:03,800
[Easily passes Kwang Soo's VJ
who was ahead of him]

1332
01:23:05,020 --> 01:23:11,300
[This is... Marine Boy, Park Tae Hwan's
athletic abilities!]

1333
01:23:13,970 --> 01:23:18,200
[No way! Easily capturing the Giraffe!]

1334
01:23:18,200 --> 01:23:20,510
Tae Hwan... why are you so fast?

1335
01:23:20,930 --> 01:23:24,060
[After running like that,
he doesn't even seem out of breath!]

1336
01:23:26,090 --> 01:23:30,890
Since we've all seen what he can do now...
let's all go look for the water bottles.

1337
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,500
I had to run all the way here,
and all the staff had to run too...

1338
01:23:34,510 --> 01:23:36,730
Don't you think one person
should be sacrificed?

1339
01:23:36,730 --> 01:23:40,920
What do you mean, sacrifice?
How can you ask that of him?

1340
01:23:40,920 --> 01:23:42,950
Then why don't you sacrifice yourself?

1341
01:23:44,960 --> 01:23:49,490
[The Red team insisting they can't sacrifice
themselves in order to protect Yeon Jae.]

1342
01:23:49,500 --> 01:23:52,100
Why don't we eliminate the
Blue team first?

1343
01:23:52,360 --> 01:23:55,460
Will the two of you..
cut us a break just this once?

1344
01:23:56,200 --> 01:23:59,540
Come on, just give us a break.
It was so hard with these large wings.

1345
01:23:59,540 --> 01:24:02,730
Jong Kook's in the same boat.
It's hard for him too.

1346
01:24:02,730 --> 01:24:06,720
But with the earth's tiger...
and the king of the ocean...

1347
01:24:07,220 --> 01:24:09,370
seriously, how can we beat that?

1348
01:24:09,370 --> 01:24:13,460
- Let's get rid of the blue team first...
- I've watched this show a lot...

1349
01:24:14,090 --> 01:24:17,090
And Kwang Soo always uses this ploy
and stabs you in the back later.

1350
01:24:17,300 --> 01:24:19,990
- He's been doing that the most lately!
- No, he's changed a lot.

1351
01:24:19,990 --> 01:24:21,880
- He does that the most lately.
- No, he really has changed a lot.

1352
01:24:21,880 --> 01:24:27,070
Just once... the next time this happens,
we will...

1353
01:24:27,070 --> 01:24:31,140
Okay then... for now, for Jae Suk,
both of you can go...

1354
01:24:31,140 --> 01:24:35,040
[Generous man, Tae Hwan
releasing both Jae Suk and Kwang Soo.]

1355
01:24:35,040 --> 01:24:39,230
[Just what result will this release bring?]

1356
01:24:39,230 --> 01:24:41,980
Thank you, Jong Kook.

1357
01:24:44,590 --> 01:24:46,140
<i>I feel like there's something here.</i>

1358
01:24:47,500 --> 01:24:50,880
[Blue team's Haroro urgently
searching for the water bottle.]

1359
01:24:53,850 --> 01:24:57,270
[Discovers a mysterious chest
at a suspicious location!]

1360
01:25:00,250 --> 01:25:02,480
[A red potion?]

1361
01:25:04,440 --> 01:25:06,570
This red color is making me nervous.

1362
01:25:08,230 --> 01:25:10,310
I feel like I'm the main character
here today.

1363
01:25:16,250 --> 01:25:19,120
It's just been so long
since I've found anything...

1364
01:25:19,940 --> 01:25:22,110
[But it seems like it's the safest place...]

1365
01:25:24,760 --> 01:25:28,060
[Heads to the witch's house
that he discovered earlier!]

1366
01:25:31,420 --> 01:25:33,350
His name tag could get
bigger too. Wait.

1367
01:25:36,330 --> 01:25:39,810
[Ha Ha arrives at the witch's house
with the red potion.]

1368
01:25:41,690 --> 01:25:44,160
Come this way.
[A red potion!]

1369
01:25:45,150 --> 01:25:46,720
Red potion, oh...!

1370
01:25:46,720 --> 01:25:49,450
- Good choice.
- Is it bad or good?

1371
01:25:49,450 --> 01:25:52,950
- Just tell me if it's good or bad.
- We'll see once we pour this in.

1372
01:25:58,570 --> 01:26:01,080
[The cauldron turns red as soon as
the red potion is poured in!]

1373
01:26:01,080 --> 01:26:03,460
I really love Running Man.
It's like the fairy tales!

1374
01:26:03,460 --> 01:26:05,410
This is just so cool!

1375
01:26:06,090 --> 01:26:08,180
I think he found a red potion.

1376
01:26:09,680 --> 01:26:11,800
This potion is a weapon...

1377
01:26:12,320 --> 01:26:15,990
I made it about 500 years ago,
and it's called pinch out.

1378
01:26:15,990 --> 01:26:17,220
Pinch out?

1379
01:26:17,220 --> 01:26:21,670
Even if your name tag is ripped off,
the person you pick is the one ousted.

1380
01:26:21,670 --> 01:26:27,430
[Even if his name tag gets ripped off,
it's the person he chooses who'll get ousted.]

1381
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,750
<i>Even if your name tag is ripped off,
the person you pick is the one ousted.</i>

1382
01:26:31,850 --> 01:26:34,510
Now choose the person that
you want ousted.

1383
01:26:34,510 --> 01:26:36,610
- Is it just one person?
- You can only choose one person.

1384
01:26:36,610 --> 01:26:40,020
[He can only choose one person.]

1385
01:26:41,730 --> 01:26:47,920
[Who's the one that will get ousted
when Ha Ha's name tag gets ripped off?]

1386
01:26:49,580 --> 01:26:51,240
Park Tae Hwan.

1387
01:26:52,430 --> 01:26:56,560
[Ha Ha chooses Tae Hwan to be the one
that gets sacrificed in his place!]

1388
01:26:56,570 --> 01:27:01,240
[Tae Hwan, I'm sorry...
but I'm going to have to sacrifice you.]

1389
01:27:02,620 --> 01:27:04,500
- Ah, but that one is unavailable.
- What?

1390
01:27:05,140 --> 01:27:09,480
[Park Tae Hwan's out is
already sold out?]

1391
01:27:09,480 --> 01:27:13,560
[Someone already took that one?]
Someone already came and bought that one.

1392
01:27:14,050 --> 01:27:18,340
[Someone has already been here
with the red potion?]

1393
01:27:18,340 --> 01:27:20,670
I made about 500 of them at first,
but there aren't many left now.

1394
01:27:22,760 --> 01:27:25,720
[Then in this case,
who should I pick instead of Tae Hwan?]

1395
01:27:25,720 --> 01:27:28,780
Now, please choose who you'd
like to oust.

1396
01:27:28,780 --> 01:27:30,200
Okay...

1397
01:27:32,870 --> 01:27:34,080
Yoo...

1398
01:27:34,950 --> 01:27:36,810
Yoo Jae Suk?

1399
01:27:39,890 --> 01:27:41,960
- Yoo Jae Suk.
- Yoo Jae Suk?

1400
01:27:43,190 --> 01:27:45,770
[That awful!]

1401
01:27:46,880 --> 01:27:50,670
[Ha Ha chooses Yoo Jae Suk
to be ousted in his place!]

1402
01:27:55,440 --> 01:27:58,260
I knew he'd do that.
I knew he'd do that!

1403
01:28:02,150 --> 01:28:04,400
Throw in a grasshopper...

1404
01:28:06,310 --> 01:28:07,440
Okay...

1405
01:28:13,320 --> 01:28:15,480
It's coming out from the bottom,
so please retrieve it.

1406
01:28:18,460 --> 01:28:21,170
You can put that on your back now.
I can put it on for you.

1407
01:28:21,180 --> 01:28:23,260
So when I get ousted,
he'll get ousted with me?

1408
01:28:23,260 --> 01:28:26,560
- No, you yourself won't be ousted.
- So only he will be ousted?

1409
01:28:26,560 --> 01:28:29,520
[If Ha Ha's name tag is ripped off once,
only Jae Suk will be ousted]

1410
01:28:30,450 --> 01:28:32,080
Please turn around.

1411
01:28:32,350 --> 01:28:36,520
You over there (Jae Suk)...
I'm sure you'll be really mad next week.

1412
01:28:37,110 --> 01:28:39,460
You're going to be really mad
if you watch this broadcast.

1413
01:28:41,750 --> 01:28:46,780
[Putting in Yoo Jae Suk's marker
behind his own name tag.]

1414
01:28:46,780 --> 01:28:50,340
[This is how another change on
the road to victory has been made.]

1415
