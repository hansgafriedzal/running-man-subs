1
00:00:00,421 --> 00:00:02,738
[Marine Boy Park Tae Hwan.]

2
00:00:02,739 --> 00:00:05,836
[Rhythm Gymnastics Fairy, Son Yeon Jae.]

3
00:00:05,837 --> 00:00:09,562
[They are here!!]

4
00:00:09,991 --> 00:00:14,169
[Running Man's training camp that's
difficult even for the Olympic heroes.]

5
00:00:15,666 --> 00:00:17,436
[And...]

6
00:00:17,437 --> 00:00:21,282
[Training camp mission -
Find the magical potion]

7
00:00:22,322 --> 00:00:26,711
[If the blue potion is found, the name
tag is transformed into a giant size.]

8
00:00:27,526 --> 00:00:30,622
[Being made into an
easy target to be chased around...]

9
00:00:31,782 --> 00:00:35,940
[On the other hand,
the effects of a red potion?]

10
00:00:37,058 --> 00:00:40,228
[Pitch- hitter out.]

11
00:00:40,229 --> 00:00:43,454
[An enormous weapon power in which
even if your name tag is ripped...]

12
00:00:43,455 --> 00:00:45,545
[someone else gets ousted instead.]

13
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:49,085
[Ha Ha chooses Jae Suk to be
ousted in his place.]

14
00:00:49,086 --> 00:00:53,079
[Jae Suk, already wise to the truth.]

15
00:00:53,488 --> 00:00:57,341
[A surreal name tag battle
swirled around in magic.]

16
00:00:57,342 --> 00:01:02,713
[Just who will be the ultimate victor?]

17
00:01:03,853 --> 00:01:07,269
I bet you'll be really mad by next week.

18
00:01:07,696 --> 00:01:10,330
I bet you'll be really fired up
when you see this broadcast.

19
00:01:11,248 --> 00:01:13,726
[I knew that he'd do this.]

20
00:01:14,975 --> 00:01:16,978
Let's sit down and talk.

21
00:01:17,942 --> 00:01:22,226
[Ha Ha relaying what just happened
to his teammates.]

22
00:01:23,173 --> 00:01:25,909
- There's good and bad potions here.
- Kwang Soo must've gotten the bad one.

23
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:31,098
That's why his name tag got big.
But look at my name tag...

24
00:01:31,649 --> 00:01:35,354
- Yoo Jae Suk will be eliminated.
- If someone tears yours off?

25
00:01:35,355 --> 00:01:40,197
[Pitch hitter out - If Ha Ha's name tag
gets ripped, Jae Suk is out]

26
00:01:40,198 --> 00:01:43,881
Don't make it obvious and let other know.
Just act casual.

27
00:01:43,882 --> 00:01:47,168
Don't even smile about it,
and don't even talk about it.

28
00:01:48,182 --> 00:01:51,886
That's why I really hope that Jae Suk
rips off my name tag.

29
00:01:51,887 --> 00:01:53,836
[Ha Ha plans on luring Jae Suk
to rip off his name tag.]

30
00:01:54,592 --> 00:01:57,258
Then while Jae Suk is watching,
you can rip Kwang Soo's name tag off.

31
00:01:57,259 --> 00:02:01,598
[Planning on ripping Kwang Soo's name tag
off in front of Jae Suk to lure him in.]

32
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:04,098
[The evil scenario]

33
00:02:04,787 --> 00:02:08,239
[Definitely getting excited
over political plays.]

34
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,915
You really are the best!

35
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,276
- Just tell Yeon Jae about it
- Okay.

36
00:02:13,444 --> 00:02:14,928
That's awesome.

37
00:02:14,929 --> 00:02:19,300
[But the problem is...
Yoo Jae Suk is watching all this]

38
00:02:20,394 --> 00:02:23,175
[A little while ago]

39
00:02:24,472 --> 00:02:25,947
<i>Yoo Jae Suk.</i>

40
00:02:25,948 --> 00:02:28,744
[Ha Ha choosing Jae Suk to be ousted in his
place after finding the red potion.]

41
00:02:28,745 --> 00:02:33,592
[By chance, Jae Suk got to witness
this event.]

42
00:02:35,231 --> 00:02:39,788
[He probably won't just sit by
and wait to be had.]

43
00:02:44,207 --> 00:02:46,259
It'll probably be good to oust a member
of the blue team first, right?

44
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:51,498
[Even if they attack the Blue team,
they have to avoid Ha Ha.]

45
00:02:52,344 --> 00:02:55,305
Either Suk Jin or Ji Hyo.
One of the two.

46
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:58,433
The scenario that Suk Jin
mentioned is the best.

47
00:03:00,867 --> 00:03:03,351
- There's Jong Kook and...
- Where?

48
00:03:04,089 --> 00:03:06,280
Hey, hey... there's Kwang Soo.
There he is.

49
00:03:06,281 --> 00:03:10,753
[Kwang Soo stepping into the trap of
the Blue team as Jae Suk planned.]

50
00:03:10,754 --> 00:03:14,610
Someone is running up there right now.
He's following someone right now.

51
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:19,001
Right? Wait a minute... come here.
Come here and squat down.

52
00:03:19,002 --> 00:03:21,468
- There's Kwang Soo.
- Kwang Soo to the right?

53
00:03:21,469 --> 00:03:26,558
[Within moments, all of Running Man
are targeting Kwang Soo.]

54
00:03:30,346 --> 00:03:32,786
[The injured Gary is keeping
watch up high.]

55
00:03:33,704 --> 00:03:35,675
[Just where is Kwang Soo heading to?]

56
00:03:39,698 --> 00:03:41,694

Kwang Soo's move!]

61

[Green Team's Coach Kook and Athlete Park,
on full on attack mode for Kwang Soo.]

64
00:04:15,014 --> 00:04:19,160
[Since I let you go once,
this time, I will get you!]

65
00:04:23,675 --> 00:04:26,421
[Escaping into a dressing room
in the corner.]

66
00:04:26,422 --> 00:04:28,839
I'm going to stay here for a moment.
Stay here just for a moment.

67
00:04:32,506 --> 00:04:36,243
[The siege has already been
set up right out front!]

68
00:04:37,883 --> 00:04:38,985
Go in there.

69

[Heading inside to get Kwang Soo.]

70
00:04:46,972 --> 00:04:49,704
- There you are.
- Wait, Jong Kook... wait.

71
00:04:49,705 --> 00:04:51,070
You can tear it off.

72
00:04:51,072 --> 00:04:53,438
I heard that you ripped it off.
I heard that you did.

73
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:54,949
Who?

74
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:56,894
- Gary.
- I didn't rip Gary's off!

75
00:04:56,895 --> 00:04:59,047
There you go lying again!
Hurry up and rip his off!

76

[Tae Hwan eliminates
Kwang Soo's name tag with a force.]

77
00:05:05,731 --> 00:05:08,157

- You ripped it off.

78
00:05:08,158 --> 00:05:11,229
[Huh? It seems like
Kwang Soo has something to say?]

79
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:12,715
- You ripped it off, right?
- No, this...

80
00:05:12,716 --> 00:05:19,470
[Huh! This is!!]
What is this?

81
00:05:19,471 --> 00:05:21,139

the water bottles on his own.]

red potion.]

[Heads off to the witches' house
immediately.]

85
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:39,257
Choose who you'd like to oust.

[Cheering after realizing the secret!]

87
00:05:43,475 --> 00:05:49,441

to oust is Tae Hwan.]

Did you do it?

97
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,209
- That really is something...
- Tae Hwan...

98
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:33,669
- And Kwang Soo's not out?
- No, I'm not.

99
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:35,283
You stay alive?

100
00:06:36,411 --> 00:06:39,928
Seriously... at the end,
he does stab me in the back.

101
00:06:41,222 --> 00:06:45,743
[Park Tae Hwan realizing what Running Man
is about with his whole being.]

102
00:06:46,412 --> 00:06:49,062
Month of August really is
turning out to be something else!

103
00:06:49,063 --> 00:06:52,082
Tae Hwan!
Wait... this is just a game.

104
00:06:52,117 --> 00:06:55,750
[This can't be how it ends...]

105
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:58,960
[The next day]

106

107

- Running Man really seems like a lot of fun.
- Isn't it fun?

109
00:07:11,152 --> 00:07:14,090
- It really brings out the competitiveness.
- Of course.

110
00:07:14,091 --> 00:07:17,904
When people watch it on TV,
they think 'Oh, that looks fun'...

111
00:07:17,905 --> 00:07:21,278
but when they actually get to come on,
it really brings out your competitive streak.

112
00:07:22,085 --> 00:07:24,791
[On the other hand...]

113
00:07:24,792 --> 00:07:28,641

[Left alone with his gigantic name tag.]

116
00:07:34,917 --> 00:07:37,609
- I asked, what you were doing?
- I was just resting for a bit.

117
00:07:38,139 --> 00:07:40,741
Is he hiding?
Are you hiding out right now?

118
00:07:40,742 --> 00:07:44,543
- No, I was just resting.
- What is Mr. Capable doing?

119
00:07:44,544 --> 00:07:48,416
- Why are you here? What are you doing here?
- Are you tucking in the sides to protect it?

120
00:07:48,417 --> 00:07:52,424
[Stuffing the wings in his arm pits so
that they don't get ripped off.]

121
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,775
Can you oust one member
of the blue team for us?

122
00:07:55,776 --> 00:07:58,656
Why are you asking that of me?
When I'm in this situation?

123
00:07:58,657 --> 00:08:00,177
Come on, just do it.

124
00:08:00,178 --> 00:08:02,601
Why would I?
Why would I in my situation?

125
00:08:02,891 --> 00:08:04,996

- Who?

I have to protect him...]

[All members of the Red team and Blue
teams are headed in that direction.]

129

Let's just finish off the one team first.

130
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,455
Seriously, these people...

131
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,166
That way, that way.

132
00:08:34,609 --> 00:08:39,898
[Red team and the Blue team
need to cooperate in this situation.]

133

[Huh?]

134
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,521
[Not able to wait it out,
going head to head with one another.]

135
00:08:45,215 --> 00:08:48,445
[A chaos where your enemy
and ally frequently changes.]

136
00:08:52,498 --> 00:08:54,973
[It didn't fall off!]

137
00:08:56,422 --> 00:09:00,084
[Just the wing got ripped off,
but the name tag remains fine!]

138
00:09:00,372 --> 00:09:02,267
Rip his off first. Rip his off first.

139
00:09:02,268 --> 00:09:06,312
[Since he already used his chance, if
his name tag gets ripped off, he's ousted!]

140
00:09:07,825 --> 00:09:10,917
[Easily eliminates
Kwang Soo's gigantic name tag.]

141
00:09:10,918 --> 00:09:13,596
This is what got ripped off.

142
00:09:13,597 --> 00:09:17,578
- Let us the blue team just end it all here.
- Okay, let's go.

143

148
00:09:34,715 --> 00:09:38,111
[And attacks from behind!
Eliminates Big-nosed brother's name tag!]

149
00:09:38,112 --> 00:09:40,652
[Attacking with a distinct agility!]

150
00:09:43,189 --> 00:09:45,370
Yeon Jae, great job! Yeon Jae...

151
00:09:45,371 --> 00:09:48,185
[The Red team's mood shifts
from despair to success!]

152
00:09:50,309 --> 00:09:51,640
Let's go for now.

153
00:09:54,141 --> 00:09:57,368
Do you know how scared I was earlier
thinking Jong Kook may oust Ha Ha?

154
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:01,769
So that I can survive, I have to...
Ah! I'm so angry! Seriously...!

155

so that he can survive...]

by both teams.]

Ha Ha...

158

I need to oust Ha Ha.

159
00:10:20,708 --> 00:10:23,721
[Jong Kook not aware that if he eliminates
Ha Ha's name, Jae Suk will be the one ousted.]

160
00:10:23,721 --> 00:10:27,806
Let's just oust one person.
Just one... I can do it.

161
00:10:32,276 --> 00:10:36,134
[Red Team headed in his direction.]

162

[Everyone gathering in front of
the tiger's cave for now!]

165

166
00:11:00,069 --> 00:11:03,780
[The women staying behind due to danger
and the men approaching closely.]

167
00:11:10,748 --> 00:11:13,582
[We saw the shoes?]

168
00:11:18,973 --> 00:11:22,099
[He's appeared! The winged tiger!]

169
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:27,080
- Let's fight! Why are we running away?
- Don't go in there. You stay back.

170
00:11:28,998 --> 00:11:33,012
[But why is he always so scary?]

171
00:11:33,013 --> 00:11:36,362
- Even though we knew...
- Knowing that he's in there, it's still scary!

172
00:11:37,464 --> 00:11:39,529
I saw you guys approaching...

173
00:11:40,323 --> 00:11:41,702
Listen...

174
00:11:42,607 --> 00:11:45,180
A girl has to rip it off.
It has to be a girl that rips it off.

175
00:11:46,297 --> 00:11:48,897
- Jae Suk, come in here.
- Come here, come here.

176
00:11:48,898 --> 00:11:50,703
I won't rip yours off.

177
00:11:50,704 --> 00:11:52,241
A girl has to approach him.

178
00:11:52,242 --> 00:11:53,935
[Ha Ha taking the lead on purpose
so that his name tag gets ripped off.]

179
00:11:53,936 --> 00:11:55,255
Hey, you get out of the way.

180
00:11:55,827 --> 00:11:57,971
[Jae Suk trying to protect
Ha Ha no matter what.]

181
00:11:57,972 --> 00:12:01,127
Let's do it together, do it together.
A girl has to take the lead.

182
00:12:02,226 --> 00:12:04,757
Wow! It's still not easy!
When there are four of us here.

183
00:12:04,758 --> 00:12:06,711
When there are four of us...

184
00:12:06,712 --> 00:12:10,559
[Ha Ha, you brat... deliberately trying to
get your name tag ripped off.]

185
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:15,436
- 1... 2...
- Wait, what are we doing?

186
00:12:15,437 --> 00:12:16,774
Hey, hey, hey!

187
00:12:17,809 --> 00:12:21,207
[About to age a thousand years
trying to protect Ha Ha.]

188
00:12:21,739 --> 00:12:26,130
[Ha Ha not feeling burdened since even if
his gets ripped off, it's Jae Suk who's out]

189
00:12:27,597 --> 00:12:29,627
I don't care if I get ousted!

190
00:12:31,044 --> 00:12:34,679
[With all his might, Jae Suk protects Ha Ha!]

191
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:39,992
[Ha Ha's purposely tries to get ripped off,
but Jae Suk keeps getting in the way...]

192
00:12:39,993 --> 00:12:41,672
Hey! Rip mine off! Mine!

193
00:12:42,147 --> 00:12:44,539
[Screaming at him to rip his name off.]

194
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:49,159
I told you to rip mine off, mine!
Why aren't you ripping it off?

195
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,350
[Danger! Protect Ha Ha!]

196
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:53,523
[Just then!!]

197
00:12:54,329 --> 00:12:57,382
[In the moment that
Jae Suk is protecting Ha Ha!]

198
00:12:58,134 --> 00:13:00,239
[Yeon Jae takes the chance!]

199
00:13:02,616 --> 00:13:05,071
[Yeon Jae, in the midst of all the chaos...]

200
00:13:05,072 --> 00:13:08,071
[...suddenly grabbing the opportunity!]

201
00:13:08,072 --> 00:13:11,669
[Eliminates winged tiger's name tag!]

202
00:13:12,623 --> 00:13:16,716
<i>Kim Jong Kook - Out. Kim Jong Kook - Out.</i>

203
00:13:17,593 --> 00:13:21,339
[You all just wait and see...]

204
00:13:28,353 --> 00:13:31,336
- Then we'll start attacking Son Yeon Jae now.
- Fine.

205
00:13:31,337 --> 00:13:34,553
- But what is that red potion?
- What about you?

206
00:13:34,554 --> 00:13:38,163
[If Jae Suk rips off Ha ha's name tag,
he himself is out. Just how will it all end?]

207
00:13:38,164 --> 00:13:39,405
I know.

208
00:13:40,343 --> 00:13:44,170
[Dramatic battle of the glares.]

209
00:13:44,171 --> 00:13:45,520
Do you have something?

210
00:13:47,168 --> 00:13:48,453
It now, Ji Hyo!

211
00:13:48,746 --> 00:13:51,374
[Jae Suk attacking Ji Hyo first!]

212
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:54,547
Now, Ji Hyo! Rip mine off!
If you have rip mine off now!

213
00:13:54,548 --> 00:13:56,434
[Just then!]

214
00:13:57,931 --> 00:13:59,543
[Jae Suk eliminates Ji Hyo's name tag!]

215
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:05,156
[Ha Ha trying to rip off his own name tag
out of sheer desperation.]

216
00:14:06,402 --> 00:14:10,026
[Ha Ha, it'll never go the way you want!]

217
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:14,156
[Okay, Yeon Jae.
I got him now so rip my name tag off!]

218
00:14:14,157 --> 00:14:17,299
[Huh? Yeon Jae's
tearing off Jae Suk's name tag?]

219
00:14:18,305 --> 00:14:20,990
[What kind of a plan is this?]

220
00:14:20,991 --> 00:14:22,705
<i>[Yoo Jae Suk, you're out.]</i>

221
00:14:22,706 --> 00:14:24,376
Yoo Jae Suk's out?

222
00:14:24,377 --> 00:14:26,488
- Why?
- I tore his name off.

223
00:14:31,062 --> 00:14:34,946
[Aha! Since Yeon Jae
already ousted Jae Suk...]

224
00:14:34,947 --> 00:14:40,396
[The power of his chance in invalid.
Therefore, Ha Ha is just out.]

225
00:14:44,403 --> 00:14:47,247
When I have Ha Ha in my grasp,
somehow I'll hold onto him...

226
00:14:47,248 --> 00:14:50,813
then you'll oust me first,
then rip off Ha Ha's name tag.

227
00:14:50,814 --> 00:14:53,940
Okay? I'll hold onto him.

228
00:14:55,412 --> 00:14:57,687
<i>What have you done, you idiot?</i>

229
00:15:01,297 --> 00:15:03,942
I thought I had it!

230
00:15:05,673 --> 00:15:08,839
[The end is totally opposite of
what Ha Ha had dreamed of.]

231
00:15:09,288 --> 00:15:11,393
[Red team's victory!]

232
00:15:11,394 --> 00:15:15,712
[This is how Running Man training
camp day one ended.]

233

- At 7 o'clock?</i>

234

[Training camp - Day 2]

235
00:15:29,441 --> 00:15:34,221
[Lodging out of a fairytale book.]

236
00:15:39,225 --> 00:15:41,148
[7 a.m.]

237
00:15:42,317 --> 00:15:45,780
[Starting with Cinderella's attic room.]

238
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:50,356
[In that room...]

239
00:15:50,357 --> 00:15:54,038
Yoo Jae Suk? Jae Suk?
[Cinderella Jae Suk?]

240
00:16:01,533 --> 00:16:03,320
- It's morning.
- Really?

241
00:16:03,321 --> 00:16:05,054
<i>The sun has already risen.</i>

242
00:16:06,497 --> 00:16:08,551
[The morning of a
difficult training camp's day two.]

243
00:16:11,548 --> 00:16:13,625
[Putting on his glasses which are
as necessary as underwear.]

244
00:16:17,614 --> 00:16:19,134
[The antennas making their rare appearance.]

245
00:16:22,161 --> 00:16:23,700
Aren't you going to wake Kwang Soo up?

246
00:16:23,701 --> 00:16:25,696
- We have to wake him up.
- He's sleeping in a princess' room.

247
00:16:25,697 --> 00:16:27,837
[Inside the Cinderella's
pumpkin carriage room is Kwang Soo]

248
00:16:32,151 --> 00:16:33,919
He's so pitiful.

249
00:16:36,728 --> 00:16:41,103
[Looking like a giraffe that's escaped
the tiger and is now in hiding.]

250
00:16:41,902 --> 00:16:43,073
Kwang Soo!

251
00:16:43,966 --> 00:16:45,282
Kwang Soo!

252
00:16:50,994 --> 00:16:52,691
Kwang Soo... out.

253
00:16:59,027 --> 00:17:00,189
[In the Little Mermaid's room
across the way.]

254
00:17:05,169 --> 00:17:07,346
- Hello.
- Did you sleep well?

255
00:17:08,139 --> 00:17:09,926

- Yes.

256

- You got up early.
- Yes, I got up early.

257

- We have to go?

258
00:17:17,129 --> 00:17:19,436
- Do I just go?
- Yes.

259
00:17:22,492 --> 00:17:23,894

[A difficult early morning
even for the Marine Boy.]

265
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:49,774
- Right now?
- Yes.

266
00:17:50,381 --> 00:17:52,182
<i>It would be more advantageous for
you to get there quickly.</i>

267
00:17:54,634 --> 00:17:56,453
[His heavy footsteps.]

268
00:18:03,073 --> 00:18:05,492
- It's Ji Hyo.
- Blank Ji Hyo, you're up early.

269
00:18:06,947 --> 00:18:09,016
[A torturous early morning for the beauty.]

270
00:18:09,998 --> 00:18:12,352
Tae Hwan! Did you sleep well?

271
00:18:13,829 --> 00:18:15,847
[And lastly, Gary's arrival.]

272
00:18:15,848 --> 00:18:17,139
You're already up?

273
00:18:18,169 --> 00:18:19,834
- What is it?
- Why is he like that?

274
00:18:19,835 --> 00:18:21,687
[A blemish...]

275
00:18:22,841 --> 00:18:24,294
- Let's see it.
- It's huge.

276
00:18:24,295 --> 00:18:26,843
- It's not big.
- It's okay.

277
00:18:28,631 --> 00:18:31,161
[Gary's sensitive skin...]

278
00:18:32,309 --> 00:18:33,546
You have to take better care of your face.

279
00:18:33,547 --> 00:18:36,458
[Having to pay more attention to taking
care of his back and his skin.]

280
00:18:36,968 --> 00:18:42,166
<i>We were going to do our morning mission
at the elementary school...</i>

281
00:18:42,167 --> 00:18:47,042
<i>But with the hurricane,
it's temporarily closed.</i>

282
00:18:48,065 --> 00:18:51,902
[This was the day that the whole country
was in fear of the big hurricane.]

283
00:18:51,903 --> 00:18:54,313
There's going to be
fierce gusts of wind and rain.

284
00:18:54,314 --> 00:18:56,833
All the schools in the country will
be closed down tomorrow.

285
00:18:57,097 --> 00:19:00,675
<i>So since we can't do
what we had originally planned...</i>

286
00:19:00,959 --> 00:19:03,599
<i>we're just going to do
a very simple game here.</i>

287
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,718
<i>Please write down one subject that
each of you feel confident in.</i>

288
00:19:06,719 --> 00:19:10,787
<i>This mission will receive an advantage
for the final mission.</i>

289
00:19:10,788 --> 00:19:15,055
[Tae Hwan's already decided that
swimming is going to be his pick.]

290
00:19:15,056 --> 00:19:18,288
<i>It has to be a game
that you can do in this room.</i>

291
00:19:18,289 --> 00:19:23,706
<i>And if the person needs a prop,
it has to be available in here.</i>

292
00:19:23,707 --> 00:19:25,795
<i>Otherwise, you can't play the game.</i>

293
00:19:25,796 --> 00:19:27,521
Something we can do without props.

294
00:19:27,907 --> 00:19:31,309
<i>We will pass out 10 marbles per person.</i>

295
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:33,733
<i>Once it is decided which one of the events
that you wrote down will be played</i>

296
00:19:33,733 --> 00:19:38,479
<i>then the person who feels confident to play
that game will bet a number of their marbles.</i>

297
00:19:42,198 --> 00:19:43,531
[Props prepared in a rush this morning]

298
00:19:43,532 --> 00:19:46,647
Ddak-Ji!

299
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:49,454
<i>Everyone scatter and write it down.</i>

300
00:19:49,455 --> 00:19:50,980
[Writing down Ddak-Ji right away!]

301
00:19:55,183 --> 00:19:58,424
[Everyone's writing down something
without hesitation.]

302
00:20:02,709 --> 00:20:06,150
[Time to announce the first event.]

303
00:20:06,565 --> 00:20:08,656
<i>The first game's event is...</i>

304
00:20:08,657 --> 00:20:11,542
[Gong-Gi]
Is Gong-Gi. (Similar to Jacks)

305
00:20:12,342 --> 00:20:15,209
Is Gong-Gi.
[A game of Gong-Gi!]

306
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:16,679
How are we going to do this?

307
00:20:19,739 --> 00:20:22,855
- Who wrote down Gong-Gi?
- Me. I wrote it down.

308
00:20:22,856 --> 00:20:25,750
In the condition my body's in,
that's one thing I can do well right now.

309
00:20:26,371 --> 00:20:29,418
[As long as there are 5 pebbles,
Gong-Gi could be played.]

310
00:20:30,704 --> 00:20:34,415
<i>Everyone gets only one chance.
You have to try to beat Kang Gary.</i>

311
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:37,411
[The person who plays it the best wins.]

312
00:20:37,412 --> 00:20:41,127
- I'll start with the first level.
- Everyone bet their marbles.

313
00:20:41,128 --> 00:20:44,594
- Why don't you all place your bets?
- Will they think I'm easy and all place a bet?

314
00:20:44,595 --> 00:20:46,628
This seems simple enough, right?

315
00:20:46,629 --> 00:20:48,962
[Ha Ha bets one.]

316
00:20:48,963 --> 00:20:50,452
You're entering? Okay.

317
00:20:51,656 --> 00:20:54,350
- Yeon Jae also enters.
- Enter!

318
00:20:55,326 --> 00:20:57,360
Why don't you bet some more?

319
00:20:57,361 --> 00:21:01,084
- I'll bet two.
- You must be good at this?

320
00:21:01,085 --> 00:21:02,609
- I'll bet one too.
- One.

321
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:04,409
I'm going to bet all five.

322
00:21:04,410 --> 00:21:06,054
No, no... two.

323
00:21:07,341 --> 00:21:09,381
[Confidence disappearing all of a sudden?]

324
00:21:09,382 --> 00:21:12,358
- I don't want to take too much on right away.
- We're all entering except for Ji Hyo.

325
00:21:12,588 --> 00:21:15,907
Ji Hyo can't do things like this.

326
00:21:15,908 --> 00:21:17,989
- She has to do more rough things.
- That's right!

327
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:21,046
- Like playing horse or something.
- Horse!

328
00:21:21,047 --> 00:21:22,556
Here I go.

329
00:21:22,557 --> 00:21:24,636
[Ha Ha takes the challenge.]

330
00:21:24,637 --> 00:21:26,172
<i>Not everyone can play this.</i>

331
00:21:26,173 --> 00:21:27,337
<i>You never know.</i>

332
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:30,628
[Fail...]

333
00:21:37,178 --> 00:21:39,912
[Haroro crumbles with Jae Suk's 'Hey!']

334
00:21:42,148 --> 00:21:43,712
[Speechless.]

335
00:21:45,042 --> 00:21:47,975
- Can you say 'Hey'?
- Of course, we can say it.

336
00:21:47,976 --> 00:21:51,668
- It's just noise that we're making.
- We could've been cheering you on.

337
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:54,125
<i>Hurry up and give them to
Yeon Jae.</i>

338
00:21:56,198 --> 00:21:58,415
[Looks as though he probably would've failed
without the interruption anyways.]

339
00:21:59,363 --> 00:22:01,101
You can't even catch it.

340
00:22:04,485 --> 00:22:07,930
- I could have done it.
- Forget it...

341
00:22:08,502 --> 00:22:10,759
As long as I can get past Yeon Jae,
I could do this...

342
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,260
<i>I think Yeon Jae is going to
be really good.</i>

343
00:22:12,261 --> 00:22:14,619
<i>She's like the dark horse here.</i>

344
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:16,481
- She's really good.
- And it hasn't been long since she played it.

345
00:22:16,482 --> 00:22:19,095
- She's like the dark horse here.
- She's really good.

346
00:22:19,096 --> 00:22:20,643
And it hasn't been long since she
would've played this game.

347
00:22:20,644 --> 00:22:22,212
She's the best when it comes to throwing
something in the air and catching it.

348
00:22:22,213 --> 00:22:25,110
- That looks dangerous.
- Pick this one over here.

349
00:22:25,111 --> 00:22:27,718
- No, you have to make a play for it.
- Listen, teacher...

350
00:22:33,303 --> 00:22:34,609
[The flexibility.]

351
00:22:34,610 --> 00:22:36,984
- She's the best!
- She's good at throwing things and catching.

352
00:22:36,985 --> 00:22:38,974
Yeon Jae's going to win this. She won this.

353
00:22:38,975 --> 00:22:40,112
[Even level 3 is no big deal]

354
00:22:41,148 --> 00:22:45,033
[The last level. Kkuk-ki]
This is what I'm bad at.

355
00:22:47,826 --> 00:22:50,577
[Sadly fails at Kkuk-ki]

356
00:22:50,578 --> 00:22:52,107
Yes! Yes!

357
00:22:53,464 --> 00:22:55,150
I really can't do that part.

358
00:22:55,531 --> 00:22:58,390
My wrist hasn't loosened up.
My wrist...

359
00:22:59,476 --> 00:23:03,302
[Yeon Jae succeeded up to level 4!]

360
00:23:03,303 --> 00:23:04,904
Is it my turn now?

361
00:23:05,797 --> 00:23:08,182
[Jae Suk takes the challenge.]

362
00:23:08,183 --> 00:23:11,002
- That doesn't look good.
- I don't think he'll be very good.

363
00:23:11,003 --> 00:23:13,553
Or he could be oddly good at it.

364
00:23:14,918 --> 00:23:17,389
- That was a little touch and go.
- He's better than I thought.

365
00:23:17,390 --> 00:23:19,720
- He's good.
- Forget it. He's done.

366
00:23:20,026 --> 00:23:22,856
[Fails immediately at level 2!]

367
00:23:22,857 --> 00:23:24,556
<i>Yes, yes, yes!</i>

368
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:28,553
This really... this isn't really working!

369
00:23:28,554 --> 00:23:30,663
I should have gone further.

370
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:34,114
Hey, Suk Jin bet 2.

371
00:23:34,115 --> 00:23:35,934
[The biggest bet.
Suk Jin betting 2 marbles]

372
00:23:35,935 --> 00:23:37,681
If he wins, then we're all in trouble.

373
00:23:37,682 --> 00:23:39,534
- This is dangerous.
- It's dangerous.

374
00:23:39,535 --> 00:23:41,512
- Those things are really light.
- Can I move them to my other hand?

375
00:23:41,513 --> 00:23:44,672
- Of course, you can't!
- What are you talking about?

376
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:47,241
It's actually not as bad as I thought.

377
00:23:47,242 --> 00:23:49,243
He really is good at the girly things.

378
00:23:52,041 --> 00:23:54,891
[Elegantly spreading out the pieces.]

379
00:23:56,105 --> 00:23:57,917
What is that? What is that?

380
00:23:57,918 --> 00:24:00,458
Splitting them up. Splitting them up.

381
00:24:01,146 --> 00:24:03,261
What... what is this?

382
00:24:03,262 --> 00:24:05,529
This is the way to scatter them
for the second level.

383
00:24:05,530 --> 00:24:08,893
- Suk Jin, you really are something...
- Grab the middle one!

384
00:24:08,894 --> 00:24:11,146
- This one?
- No, the pink one.

385
00:24:11,743 --> 00:24:14,392
- Okay.
- You can't coach him like that.

386
00:24:14,393 --> 00:24:15,843
Sorry.

387
00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:19,415
[Girly Impala brother's chaotic play.]

388
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:21,216
Since guys are normally bad at this,
I kind of hope that he does well.

389
00:24:24,005 --> 00:24:26,629
[Even Jae Suk's 'Hey' isn't working!]

390
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:28,478
He's really good at things like knitting.

391
00:24:30,318 --> 00:24:32,629
[Elegantly splitting them up again.]

392
00:24:33,831 --> 00:24:34,965
Did you see that?

393
00:24:34,966 --> 00:24:37,037
That's good.
You can grab three.

394
00:24:37,419 --> 00:24:40,494
- Drop it!
- Wow... awesome.

395
00:24:40,495 --> 00:24:41,611
[Easily passing level 3 too!]

396
00:24:42,349 --> 00:24:44,933
[Huh?]

397
00:24:47,376 --> 00:24:50,599
[After doing so well,
what are you doing on level 4?]

398
00:24:52,252 --> 00:24:54,643
[4th level should've been done
the way Yeon Jae did earlier]

399
00:24:55,257 --> 00:24:58,092
[Splitting them up like he's
been doing...]

400
00:25:01,882 --> 00:25:04,599
He does have the skills,
but he doesn't know the rules.

401
00:25:08,022 --> 00:25:09,594
- My turn.
- Okay.

402
00:25:09,595 --> 00:25:13,797
[Muscleman, Coach Kook's turn.]
He's going to play this with those muscles?

403
00:25:14,819 --> 00:25:17,240
- Just look at him!
- He really isn't good!

404
00:25:17,241 --> 00:25:18,664
[Heavy handiwork.]

405
00:25:20,658 --> 00:25:22,849
My hands are getting sweaty.

406
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:26,009
[Fail...]

407
00:25:26,010 --> 00:25:27,536
Yes! Yes!

408
00:25:28,207 --> 00:25:30,554
- He's really bad!
- Who do you think you're coaching?

409
00:25:30,555 --> 00:25:32,619
It's not working because
my hands keep getting sweaty.

410
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:35,046
Yeon Jae got furthest with it.

411
00:25:35,047 --> 00:25:37,676
- This has to be heavier for it to work well.
- Right?

412
00:25:37,677 --> 00:25:39,218
[Marine Boy, Tae Hwan's turn]

413
00:25:39,219 --> 00:25:40,736
Who scatters them out like that?

414
00:25:41,414 --> 00:25:44,703
He's good.
[He's good?]

415
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:47,924
- I didn't think that he'd be good.
- That's hard. That looks hard.

416
00:25:47,925 --> 00:25:49,953
The red one.
You should go with the red one.

417
00:25:52,683 --> 00:25:54,397
[Wow?]

418
00:25:54,398 --> 00:25:56,547
[Fail...]

419
00:25:58,019 --> 00:25:59,958
[Even though he's shown us his quick
handiwork, he also fails]

420
00:25:59,959 --> 00:26:03,034
If he doesn't get to Kkuk-ki,
then Yeon Jae...

421
00:26:03,035 --> 00:26:04,514
Even if he can even get to that part,
he'll win.

422
00:26:04,515 --> 00:26:06,666
I can't get comfortable.

423
00:26:06,667 --> 00:26:08,229
You can lean forward a bit more.

424
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:11,224
If you end here when you're the one
who picked this event...

425
00:26:12,181 --> 00:26:13,865
He actually is pretty good.

426
00:26:13,866 --> 00:26:15,620
Yeah, he's good.

427
00:26:17,062 --> 00:26:19,851
[Easily succeeds level 1.]

428
00:26:21,871 --> 00:26:24,234
- He's making me nervous.
- This is nerve-wrecking.

429
00:26:26,347 --> 00:26:28,556
[Gary tries Big-nosed brother's method.]

430
00:26:31,677 --> 00:26:32,993
- He's good.
- No.

431
00:26:34,303 --> 00:26:36,404
[Fail...]

432
00:26:42,835 --> 00:26:45,469
Yeon Jae, Yeon Jae won it all.

433
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:49,194
[Top winner Yeon Jae, doubles
her win and gains two marbles]

434
00:26:49,195 --> 00:26:51,185
- Yeon Jae right now...
- What a loss!

435
00:26:51,186 --> 00:26:53,293
Then why don't we go on to
the next event?

436
00:26:53,294 --> 00:26:55,725
I hope it's what I wrote down
for the next event.

437
00:26:57,021 --> 00:27:00,051
[Ddak-Ji]
Ddak-Ji!

438
00:27:00,052 --> 00:27:01,293
Oh my goodness!

439
00:27:01,294 --> 00:27:03,131
- Ddak-Ji!
- Oh my goodness.

440
00:27:04,319 --> 00:27:06,824
[It's Ddak-Ji...]

441
00:27:07,421 --> 00:27:10,628
Jae Suk, Jae Suk...
[The legendary King of Ddak-Ji, Jae Suk]

442
00:27:12,563 --> 00:27:15,824
[If he holds onto a Ddak-Ji and
gathers his energy...]

443
00:27:17,871 --> 00:27:21,634
[The opponent's Ddak-Ji
ultimately flips over]

444
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:28,747
[This is Jae Suk's game of specialty.]

445
00:27:29,868 --> 00:27:32,255
- We're screwed.
- What happens if no one bets?

446
00:27:32,256 --> 00:27:35,411
- What if none of us bets?
- Then I can bet on myself, right?

447
00:27:35,412 --> 00:27:37,486
I'm not going to enter this.

448
00:27:38,237 --> 00:27:41,138
- What the heck, Gary?
- I'm not entering.

449
00:27:41,139 --> 00:27:43,284
I'll bet one.

450
00:27:43,285 --> 00:27:45,319
Tae Hwan is the dark horse here.

451
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:48,592
- I was going to see what he does.
- What are you going to do?

452
00:27:48,593 --> 00:27:51,662
- I'll bet one too.
- Do we have to beat him then?

453
00:27:51,663 --> 00:27:55,067
[Jong Kook, Suk Jin, and Kwang Soo
each enter with one marble.]

454
00:27:55,068 --> 00:27:58,533
[It's King of Ddak-Ji, Jae Suk's turn to bet.]

455
00:27:58,534 --> 00:28:00,381
I think betting two would be too weak.

456
00:28:00,382 --> 00:28:02,867
- Four... bet four.
- Four?

457
00:28:02,868 --> 00:28:05,820
[Following Yeon Jae's suggestion, betting four]
I'll bet four!

458
00:28:05,821 --> 00:28:07,375
- I'm going to stay out of this.
- Okay, stay out of it.

459
00:28:07,376 --> 00:28:09,531
You're not good at Ddak-Ji?

460
00:28:09,532 --> 00:28:11,277
Jae Suk is way too good at it.

461
00:28:12,353 --> 00:28:14,121
- There's no reason to even try...
- He's like a God when it comes to it.

462
00:28:14,122 --> 00:28:15,860
I don't know, you never know.

463
00:28:15,861 --> 00:28:17,861
There aren't many participants.

464
00:28:18,527 --> 00:28:21,637
[The game to be carried out the way Jae Suk
makes the rules since it's his game.]

465
00:28:21,638 --> 00:28:23,509
- Can I make the rules then?
- You'll move up to play the winner.

466
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:26,046
[Kwang Soo, Suk Jin, Jong Kook and Tae Hwan
playing in a tournament to beat Jae Suk.]

467
00:28:26,047 --> 00:28:28,392
Then as for the matches...

468
00:28:28,393 --> 00:28:30,424
We can't play like this.

469
00:28:30,425 --> 00:28:31,779
- Why?
- Me against him?

470
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:34,208
- Jong Kook and I...
- You think this is too much?

471
00:28:35,670 --> 00:28:38,438
[Ever unchanging strong composition
when it comes to this game playing.]

472
00:28:38,439 --> 00:28:40,049
We can play Rock-Paper-Scissors
and decide.

473
00:28:40,050 --> 00:28:42,640
Why do you guys make it seem like
we're not good at Ddak-Ji?

474
00:28:42,641 --> 00:28:44,832
Why do you think we can't play this?

475
00:28:46,398 --> 00:28:47,668
In that case...

476
00:28:47,669 --> 00:28:49,805
I'll write down all of your names
down here...

477
00:28:50,745 --> 00:28:53,317
- And we'll pick it that way.
- This is important.

478
00:28:53,318 --> 00:28:55,206
- Yes, this is important.
- Of course, it is.

479
00:28:55,207 --> 00:28:57,175
I'll announce the first match up.

480
00:28:58,667 --> 00:29:00,350
Ji Suk Jin...

481
00:29:01,691 --> 00:29:03,270
Park Tae Hwan.

482
00:29:03,271 --> 00:29:05,641
[The first match is Suk Jin vs. Tae Hwan]

483
00:29:06,716 --> 00:29:08,382
- You can do this.
- Of course, I can.

484
00:29:08,383 --> 00:29:10,306
- I'm not going to give you a break.
- You never know how it'll turn up.

485
00:29:10,307 --> 00:29:12,093
You have to win this!

486
00:29:12,094 --> 00:29:15,486
- If you think you can beat him...
- Look at Tae Hwan swinging his arms.

487
00:29:17,051 --> 00:29:19,019
How do you loosen up your arms
like that?

488
00:29:20,975 --> 00:29:24,005
[The roar that shakes up
the whole living room.]

489

[Tae Hwan wins the Rock-Paper-Scissors]

493
00:29:31,061 --> 00:29:33,457
- Why even try to beat him?
- Put it down here.

494
00:29:33,458 --> 00:29:35,644
[One single game where it's hard to
guess who the winner is going to be.]

495
00:29:35,931 --> 00:29:37,484
- Do I just go?
- Yes.

496
00:29:40,168 --> 00:29:41,857
[Ah... a missed throw.]

497
00:29:41,858 --> 00:29:43,781
Even though he's strong,
he misses his throws!

498
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:45,255
[Believing it's all about the power,
Tae Hwan misses the mark.]

499
00:29:45,256 --> 00:29:48,129
- You have to hit it just right.
- You never know... you don't know.

500
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:49,582
Suk Jin, show us how it's done!

501
00:29:49,583 --> 00:29:51,571
[Impala's miracle?]

502
00:29:51,571 --> 00:29:54,587
[Ah! A full flip!]

503
00:29:55,801 --> 00:29:56,865
It did a complete flip.

504
00:29:57,381 --> 00:29:58,798
[Tae Hwan's turn again]

505
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:00,120
That's right!

506
00:30:01,433 --> 00:30:03,449
[Easily flipping it over...]

507
00:30:03,450 --> 00:30:05,033
Park Tae Hwan, wins.

508
00:30:05,861 --> 00:30:08,064
What are you doing?

509
00:30:08,065 --> 00:30:09,370
Suk Jin...

510
00:30:10,125 --> 00:30:13,236
Lee Kwang Soo, Ji Suk Jin... I mean,
Lee Kwang Soo and Kim Jong Kook.

511
00:30:13,237 --> 00:30:15,683
What... what are you doing?

512
00:30:15,684 --> 00:30:17,231
- I'm going to use that one.
- What a joke!

513
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:19,500
[A fight over the ownership of Ddak-Ji]

514
00:30:20,213 --> 00:30:21,313
Referee...

515
00:30:21,348 --> 00:30:24,172
- Please make the call here.
- One who wins Rock-Paper-Scissors...

516
00:30:24,173 --> 00:30:25,199
Why?

517
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,365
Why?

518
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:28,333
- Since he's the referee...
- What a weirdo, you are!

519
00:30:28,334 --> 00:30:30,595
- The person who wins...
- It's a conspiracy here!

520
00:30:31,566 --> 00:30:34,075
- This isn't right.
- There's a conspiracy?

521
00:30:34,076 --> 00:30:37,077
Where? Where?
[Hates conspiracies.]

522
00:30:37,078 --> 00:30:38,674
Rock-Paper-Scissors!

523
00:30:39,033 --> 00:30:41,297
[Even losing the Rock-Paper-Scissors]

524
00:30:43,165 --> 00:30:47,699
After all those years of working out,
all to play Gong-Gi and Ddak-Ji.

525
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:49,510
[Years of working out just in preparation
to play Gong-Gi and Ddak-Ji.]

526
00:30:50,696 --> 00:30:52,968
- It takes just one good hit...
- You never know.

527
00:30:53,835 --> 00:30:56,080
[With just one hit!]

528
00:31:00,337 --> 00:31:03,506
[Giraffe losing
his opportunity to even hit it.]

529
00:31:05,696 --> 00:31:08,768
- Who is it this time?
- Park Tae Hwan and Kim Jong Kook!

530
00:31:08,769 --> 00:31:10,814
[Park Tae Hwang vs. Kim Jong kook]

531
00:31:10,815 --> 00:31:13,282
- The person who loses this...
- Tae Hwan is like my little brother!

532
00:31:13,283 --> 00:31:16,200
Why are you two so close all of a sudden?
It's seriously driving me crazy.

533
00:31:16,201 --> 00:31:18,009
Tae Hwan, you go first.

534
00:31:20,227 --> 00:31:23,308
[Cleanly conceding
to his famous little brother.]

535
00:31:23,309 --> 00:31:25,543
And Tae Hwan really is going to go first.

536
00:31:25,544 --> 00:31:28,228
[Confident little brother Tae Hwan doing
what his older brother tells him to do.]

537
00:31:28,229 --> 00:31:29,947
- You can go first...
- No, that's okay. You go.

538
00:31:29,948 --> 00:31:32,193
- It's okay.
- See? Ultimately, he's going first.

539
00:31:32,674 --> 00:31:34,386
Since Tae Hwan has the flag behind him.

540
00:31:37,236 --> 00:31:39,422
[Ah... a full rotation.]

541
00:31:40,298 --> 00:31:42,157
You have to do it right.

542
00:31:42,158 --> 00:31:43,580
This is trouble.

543
00:31:43,581 --> 00:31:45,829
- Jong Kook, I'm okay. I'm fine.
- You're okay?

544
00:31:47,981 --> 00:31:50,418
[Flipping it over right away.]

545
00:31:53,054 --> 00:31:54,556
Why are you working so hard at this?

546
00:31:55,549 --> 00:31:57,554
The one who travels through time!

547
00:31:58,936 --> 00:32:02,539
[Facing embarrassment because of his
Tiger brother who shows no mercy?]

548
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:05,009
- You have to do it again.
- No, no... it's okay.

549
00:32:06,114 --> 00:32:09,076
It's because I want to
go up against Jae Suk...

550
00:32:09,077 --> 00:32:10,897
- I'm sorry, Tae Hwan.
- Fighting.

551
00:32:10,898 --> 00:32:13,533
- Why are you taking that?
- It's mine.

552
00:32:14,577 --> 00:32:15,673
Let's just do this.

553
00:32:16,499 --> 00:32:18,089
Rock-Paper-Scissors!

554
00:32:18,090 --> 00:32:20,694
[Jong Kook wins the Rock-Paper-Scissors,
with the victory hanging on the line.]

555
00:32:21,592 --> 00:32:23,642
- I'm in total trouble.
- Is this such a good thing?

556
00:32:23,643 --> 00:32:25,201
Am I supposed to be this happy
about this?

557
00:32:25,511 --> 00:32:27,602
There should be at least one person
like this in every game.

558
00:32:28,585 --> 00:32:30,161
What are you doing?

559
00:32:30,409 --> 00:32:31,781
What are you doing?

560
00:32:32,119 --> 00:32:35,463
- You really are a weird person.
- Why are you getting so mad?

561
00:32:35,464 --> 00:32:39,081
You're not supposed to keep stepping
on it like that. Fine, we're good.

562
00:32:39,082 --> 00:32:41,056
Please, please, please...

563
00:32:41,057 --> 00:32:43,359
You can't flip it over right now.
Please, please, please...

564
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:44,647
One shot... you have to get it done.

565
00:32:48,064 --> 00:32:50,698
[It flipped over...]

566
00:32:51,958 --> 00:32:54,013
[Over in just one shot.]

567
00:32:58,414 --> 00:33:02,265
[Tiger's self-confidence crushing roar.]

568
00:33:02,266 --> 00:33:03,769
He didn't even get to throw a single one.

569
00:33:03,770 --> 00:33:06,894
[The one who chose the game didn't
even get to throw a single shot.]

570
00:33:06,895 --> 00:33:09,208
- Best out of three?
- Okay, let's do best out of three.

571
00:33:09,209 --> 00:33:12,047
- Best out of three wins, okay?
- Best out of three wins.

572
00:33:12,415 --> 00:33:14,065
- Rock-Paper-Scissors.
- Rock-Paper-Scissors!

573
00:33:14,066 --> 00:33:15,569
[The all-important Rock-Paper-Scissors.]

574
00:33:15,570 --> 00:33:17,834
[The tiger wins again.]

575
00:33:19,749 --> 00:33:22,981
[An undeniable roar again this time.]

576
00:33:23,312 --> 00:33:26,089
- No way... no way.
- Yeon Jae, this is the kind of man he is.

577
00:33:30,562 --> 00:33:32,919
[Jae Suk desperately wishing
for a missed shot.]

578
00:33:35,724 --> 00:33:38,329
[The end...]

579
00:33:38,871 --> 00:33:40,979
[Jong Kook wins.]

580
00:33:42,822 --> 00:33:45,909
[Hasn't been able to throw a single Ddak-Ji.]

581
00:33:48,332 --> 00:33:49,609
This is hard.

582
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:51,576
<i>Why don't you throw it at least once?</i>

583
00:33:54,348 --> 00:33:56,502
[What...]

584
00:33:56,503 --> 00:33:58,343
You're not good at Ddak-Ji, Jae Suk...

585
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:02,303
- I should have bet too!
- I should've bet more than one!

586
00:34:02,304 --> 00:34:05,032
- Yeon Jae, we should've bet, right?
- Just one, I just bet one.

587
00:34:05,033 --> 00:34:09,714
I need two then. I didn't even expect this.
I didn't even expect this to happen.

588
00:34:09,749 --> 00:34:13,076
I just didn't... wow,
I'm glad I did this.

589
00:34:13,077 --> 00:34:15,039
Don't even say that
you're good at Ddak-Ji anymore.

590
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:17,645
[Let's chalk it up as
having played the game.]

591
00:34:18,004 --> 00:34:20,361
[The third event is...]

592
00:34:20,656 --> 00:34:23,064
- What is it this time?
- It's stretching.

593
00:34:23,065 --> 00:34:24,774
Ugh... stretching?

594
00:34:25,607 --> 00:34:27,821
[Stretching!]

595
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:31,874
- I can guess who wrote this down.
- This one is definitely...

596
00:34:31,875 --> 00:34:33,496
[Tying her hair?]

597
00:34:33,497 --> 00:34:37,688
- Why are you tying your hair?
- How are we going to do this stretching?

598
00:34:37,689 --> 00:34:40,474
Like I undoubtedly told you,
you just have to do what you're good at.

599
00:34:40,475 --> 00:34:42,947
Then just show us a demonstration
as to what we need to do.

600
00:34:42,948 --> 00:34:48,462
If we can follow the three moves
that Yeon Jae shows us... then we win.

601
00:34:48,497 --> 00:34:52,410
- So you're trying to beat Son Yeon Jae?
- Yes, then we beat Son Yeon Jae.

602
00:34:52,979 --> 00:34:54,605
Show us a little taste...

603
00:34:55,466 --> 00:34:59,471
Well, the most basic thing is...

604
00:34:59,472 --> 00:35:01,908
[That is?]

605
00:35:01,909 --> 00:35:03,554
That's the little taste?

606
00:35:04,584 --> 00:35:08,215
- This is the most basic stretch.
- That's the little taste?

607
00:35:09,644 --> 00:35:11,768
Yeon Jae, what are you doing
this morning already?

608
00:35:11,769 --> 00:35:14,220
- Yeon Jae, that's the most basic thing?
- Yes.

609
00:35:14,221 --> 00:35:16,228
To us, that's like our life-long dream.

610
00:35:16,906 --> 00:35:21,563
- Then... you can stretch forward like this...
- You can touch your toes?

611
00:35:21,564 --> 00:35:24,345
[2nd move - Bend your upper body
and stretch over your lower body.]

612
00:35:25,251 --> 00:35:29,088
- Touch your toes with your hands?
- If that's the 2nd, then what's the 3rd?

613
00:35:29,978 --> 00:35:34,667
- What's the 3rd one?
- Stand up and do like a back-bend?

614
00:35:35,101 --> 00:35:36,852
- Can you do that?
- Can you do it?

615
00:35:36,853 --> 00:35:38,826
- She needs to warm up first.
- Can you do it first thing in the morning?

616
00:35:38,827 --> 00:35:42,589
On my stomach...
I don't think I can do it either.

617
00:35:43,496 --> 00:35:47,429
[A difficult move even for Yeon Jae
this early in the morning.]

618
00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:49,637
Yeon Jae, don't do it. Don't do it!

619
00:35:50,651 --> 00:35:52,252
Yeon Jae, don't do it.

620
00:35:52,253 --> 00:35:54,766
- We thought you could do all that, sorry.
- Sorry, Yeon Jae.

621
00:35:54,767 --> 00:35:58,331
- We thought anything was feasible...
- Sorry, Yeon Jae.

622
00:35:58,332 --> 00:36:00,227
[So the 3rd move is...]

623
00:36:00,228 --> 00:36:03,353
[Stand up and do... this move.]

624
00:36:05,675 --> 00:36:09,326
[Oh my...]

625
00:36:10,415 --> 00:36:13,348
[This is the 3rd move.]

626
00:36:13,919 --> 00:36:18,573
- So these are... the basics...
- Why are you being so shy about it?

627
00:36:18,574 --> 00:36:20,398
No one is going to be able to do that!

628
00:36:20,399 --> 00:36:22,036
Yeon Jae needs to bet something.

629
00:36:22,037 --> 00:36:24,707
I'll bet... four? Five?

630
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:28,901
[Four or five?]

631
00:36:28,902 --> 00:36:30,063
Yeon Jae!

632
00:36:33,247 --> 00:36:35,668
Only the way she speaks is nice...

633
00:36:36,287 --> 00:36:38,821
- Betting four or five?
- Sit down.

634
00:36:41,611 --> 00:36:43,890
[Yeon Jae bets 4 marbles]
You're really betting 4?

635
00:36:43,891 --> 00:36:45,527
I'm going to pass.

636
00:36:47,971 --> 00:36:50,464
- You're good at it, aren't you?
- Tae Hwan, aren't you going to bet?

637
00:36:50,465 --> 00:36:53,760
So I just need to do one of the three moves
that Yeon Jae showed us?

638
00:36:53,761 --> 00:36:56,601
- Can't you do this?
- Tae Hwan, can't you do this?

639
00:36:56,602 --> 00:37:00,007
- If Son Yeon Jae agrees to it...
- Then make it where the chest has to touch.

640
00:37:00,008 --> 00:37:02,333
- Yes, like this.
- Was that what it was from the beginning?

641
00:37:02,334 --> 00:37:03,936
[Her words are a bit different than
what she said earlier...]

642
00:37:03,937 --> 00:37:06,434
- You said we just had to touch the toes.
- Isn't that what you said earlier?

643
00:37:06,435 --> 00:37:08,784
- Yeon Jae, are you changing your story?
- I'm afraid that Tae Hwan can do it...

644
00:37:08,785 --> 00:37:10,516
Wow... you changed your story?

645
00:37:11,877 --> 00:37:13,858
- Then the chest has to touch?
- That's really going to hurt.

646
00:37:13,859 --> 00:37:16,111
I guess Yeon Jae
is just going to take them all.

647
00:37:21,044 --> 00:37:23,643
Why did you do it? Why did you show her?

648
00:37:23,644 --> 00:37:27,524
In that case... we'll finalize the rules now.

649
00:37:27,525 --> 00:37:29,513
- We'll finalize it now.
- To see who's going to enter.

650
00:37:29,514 --> 00:37:31,995
- First...
- Can I change what I said earlier?

651
00:37:31,996 --> 00:37:35,073
- Yes, you can change it.
- Really?

652
00:37:35,074 --> 00:37:37,858
- You can change it.
- Then, you need to do 2 moves out of the 3...

653
00:37:39,415 --> 00:37:42,001
[Immediately changing to succeeding
in doing 2 moves out of the 3.]

654
00:37:44,031 --> 00:37:47,381
[Yeon Jae rushing to change the rules
in fear of Tae Hwan's abilities.]

655
00:37:48,212 --> 00:37:50,853
- How can we...
- Bet. Make your bets.

656
00:37:52,798 --> 00:37:54,396
What do you take
these marbles for to be doing this?

657
00:37:55,292 --> 00:37:58,866
When Tae Hwan touched his
chest to his legs...

658
00:37:59,127 --> 00:38:03,807
Then Yeon Jae, how about if we collectively
followed 2 of your 3 moves?

659
00:38:03,808 --> 00:38:05,932
- All of us combined to do 2?
- Okay.

660
00:38:05,933 --> 00:38:10,564
Then Yeon Jae... show us the 3 moves that
we're supposed to follow one last time.

661
00:38:12,022 --> 00:38:14,088
- Okay, this is the first move.
- This is the first move.

662
00:38:14,089 --> 00:38:16,269
- Bend forward like this.
- The chest has to touch completely.

663
00:38:16,270 --> 00:38:18,640
- Now the second?
- Yeon Jae, it wasn't that bad earlier...

664
00:38:19,054 --> 00:38:23,634
- Then... do it like this...
- And your arms, lift your arms.

665
00:38:23,635 --> 00:38:25,910
[Second move-
Do the splits and raise your arms?]

666
00:38:28,215 --> 00:38:30,220
Why did you add the arms?

667
00:38:31,199 --> 00:38:33,967
- The third move!
- Well that one is like this...

668
00:38:33,968 --> 00:38:36,075
[Do the vertical splits while standing up.]

669
00:38:36,384 --> 00:38:39,120
So if you're going to do it, then do it.
Otherwise, don't do it.

670
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:41,519
[It is up to the individual on whether
they want to participate or not.]

671
00:38:41,519 --> 00:38:44,678
We have to do two moves out of
the three?

672
00:38:44,679 --> 00:38:47,739
- There's another solution. You...
- Should I rip his legs apart?

673
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:49,019
Just rip them apart.

674
00:38:50,532 --> 00:38:53,225
[The way to beat Son Yeon Jae is to
forcefully rip Giraffe's legs apart?]

675
00:38:53,582 --> 00:38:56,488
Ji Hyo, you can't do the splits?

676
00:38:56,489 --> 00:39:00,685
- Are you going to participate?
- I'm really bad at stretching...

677
00:39:01,017 --> 00:39:04,424
Just try it.
It may be better for Ji Hyo to do it.

678
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:07,731
- Give it back! Come here!
- I'm placing the bet for her!

679
00:39:07,732 --> 00:39:09,796
- She's entered!
- Okay, Ha Ha has entered the game then.

680
00:39:13,010 --> 00:39:14,712
- It's her marble.
- Okay, Ha Ha's entered.

681
00:39:14,713 --> 00:39:15,938
But you entered the marble yourself.

682
00:39:16,730 --> 00:39:18,665
Ha Ha, give a marble to Ji Hyo.

683
00:39:21,001 --> 00:39:24,403
I didn't know you were so active about it...
I had no idea you were so all about it.

684
00:39:25,816 --> 00:39:27,467
I'm going to pass.

685
00:39:28,821 --> 00:39:34,399
- But if no one participates in this...
- No, you can participate Ji Hyo.

686
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,949
And I was told that I've already
entered this game.

687
00:39:36,774 --> 00:39:39,336
- Other than Ha Ha...
- Anyone who else wants to do it, throw it in.

688
00:39:39,337 --> 00:39:43,171
[Actively participating in it as if he's
been waiting for the stretching game]

689
00:39:45,138 --> 00:39:50,171
[If just watching the replay of the scene,
like a person who's bee eagerly waiting...]

690
00:39:52,629 --> 00:39:56,124
I never knew that Ha Ha was so
active about stretching like this.

691
00:39:56,550 --> 00:40:00,266
Since everyone's putting their effort
into it, I'll participate in it too.

692
00:40:00,267 --> 00:40:03,177
- Good, good.
- If we plan this right, we can do this.

693
00:40:03,178 --> 00:40:05,986
- Kwang Soo...
- It's Yeon Jae against the rest of us.

694
00:40:05,987 --> 00:40:07,129
We have to beat Yeon Jae.

695
00:40:07,130 --> 00:40:11,181
If by any chance we win this,
everyone who entered wins?

696
00:40:11,182 --> 00:40:12,857
Then starting with Song Ji Hyo.

697
00:40:12,858 --> 00:40:15,219
The chest has to touch completely.

698
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:18,034
- And like this...
- And raise the arms too. The arms.

699
00:40:18,035 --> 00:40:20,358
[Second move - Make sure to raise the arms]

700
00:40:20,359 --> 00:40:23,189
[And for the third move-
Just stand and do the splits.]

701
00:40:23,852 --> 00:40:25,445
Ji Hyo, show us your skills.

702
00:40:25,446 --> 00:40:28,538
- Maybe the splits?
- You can try the splits, maybe...

703
00:40:28,539 --> 00:40:30,570
- Ji Hyo...
- You might be able to do it!

704
00:40:31,338 --> 00:40:33,122
- You can do it!
- Challenge!

705
00:40:33,123 --> 00:40:35,382
[Blank Ji taking the challenge to touch
her chest to the legs.]

706
00:40:35,383 --> 00:40:37,629
[Fail...]

707
00:40:38,226 --> 00:40:39,984
- What was that? What are you doing?
- Fail. You failed.

708
00:40:39,985 --> 00:40:45,623
Ji Hyo fails. Next up is...
the one who most actively...

709
00:40:45,849 --> 00:40:48,330
[Stretching loving man, Ha Dong Hoon.]

710
00:40:48,819 --> 00:40:49,944
Please shout out, 'challenge'.

711
00:40:50,267 --> 00:40:52,000
- 1, 2, 3.
- Challenge.

712
00:40:52,001 --> 00:40:55,314
You've got three seconds.
1, 2, 3!

713
00:40:56,223 --> 00:40:57,688
[Fail...]

714
00:40:59,150 --> 00:41:00,276
Okay, you failed.

715
00:41:02,057 --> 00:41:04,500
[Sudden stretching's agony that can be
felt throughout the whole body.]

716
00:41:04,790 --> 00:41:06,235
Okay, he failed. Next move.

717
00:41:07,637 --> 00:41:09,676
[The third move-
Doing the splits while standing up.]

718
00:41:09,677 --> 00:41:10,911
You can do it!

719
00:41:10,912 --> 00:41:12,744
You have three seconds after
you say 'Challenge'.

720
00:41:13,572 --> 00:41:15,299
You have to pull it off within
three seconds.

721
00:41:15,709 --> 00:41:17,219
- Challenge!
- Challenge.

722
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:20,944
Challenge. 1, 2, 3!

723
00:41:22,522 --> 00:41:24,196
- Okay, you can do it!
- That was a fail.

724
00:41:25,833 --> 00:41:28,126
[Challenge that leaves only agony behind.]

725
00:41:31,772 --> 00:41:33,109
His legs... his legs are too short.

726
00:41:33,110 --> 00:41:35,712
[His love for stretching that
only leaves behind the pain.]

727
00:41:35,713 --> 00:41:37,765
Next is... Lee Kwang Soo.

728
00:41:37,766 --> 00:41:39,542
- Jong Kook, help me.
- There's not much time left.

729
00:41:39,543 --> 00:41:42,779
- You have to help me.
- I can help. Tae Hwan... let's help.

730
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:44,323
Tae Hwan and I can help you.

731
00:41:45,081 --> 00:41:47,491
- Which one do you want to do first?
- Do the vertical splits.

732
00:41:47,492 --> 00:41:49,679
I just have to
stretch my legs out straight, right?

733
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:52,401
- Try it, just try it.
- He really is so tall!

734
00:41:52,402 --> 00:41:55,190
- How should we do this?
- He looks like a giraffe.

735
00:41:56,659 --> 00:41:59,135
[Forcing him to become flexible.]

736
00:42:00,147 --> 00:42:03,587
- Isn't it done yet? Isn't this good?
- You have to stretch it out more.

737
00:42:05,477 --> 00:42:08,095
[Forcefully put into the position,
will he be able to pull it off?]

738
00:42:10,968 --> 00:42:12,960
[Zero flexibility.]

739
00:42:12,961 --> 00:42:14,816
- You should've stretched it out.
- Okay, the next move.

740
00:42:14,817 --> 00:42:16,410
Let's do the splits.

741
00:42:16,411 --> 00:42:19,329
- You have to push him down from behind.
- Wow... he's so long!

742
00:42:19,330 --> 00:42:22,733
Kwang Soo, if you can pull this off,
Tae Hwan can touch his chest to his knees.

743
00:42:23,882 --> 00:42:25,401
You really are long though...

744
00:42:27,195 --> 00:42:29,469
[After completing the chaotic warm-up,
ready to take the challenge!]

745
00:42:29,470 --> 00:42:32,803
1... 2... 3!

746
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:39,068
[The Giraffe's explosion.]

747
00:42:41,704 --> 00:42:43,863
You really kicked me hard!
Why did you kick me?

748
00:42:44,113 --> 00:42:45,833
You asked me to help you!

749
00:42:46,359 --> 00:42:48,026
Lee Kwang Soo, fail.

750
00:42:48,225 --> 00:42:51,140
Our last surviving hope, Park Tae Hwan!

751
00:42:52,869 --> 00:42:55,007
- If he can do two of the moves, we win?
- Of course.

752
00:42:55,008 --> 00:42:56,738
Do the chest touching thing first.

753
00:42:56,976 --> 00:42:58,429
He was really good at it.

754
00:42:58,430 --> 00:43:00,945
It was just one in the beginning,
but she switched to two after seeing this.

755
00:43:00,946 --> 00:43:03,457
To be honest, it wasn't even
the chest touch to begin with.

756
00:43:04,193 --> 00:43:06,571
At first, all we had to do was to
touch our toes with our hands.

757
00:43:06,572 --> 00:43:11,875
Yeon Jae changed the rules about 3 times.
She made the changes little by little 3 times.

758
00:43:12,855 --> 00:43:14,239
Okay, I'm going for it.

759
00:43:17,398 --> 00:43:19,620
[Succeeding the first move within moments.]

760
00:43:19,621 --> 00:43:22,607
- Success. That was a success.
- No one else could do even that.

761
00:43:24,685 --> 00:43:26,297
- You just need to do one more. One more.
- You just need to do one more.

762
00:43:26,298 --> 00:43:28,498
How about the splits?
Don't you think that would be best?

763
00:43:28,628 --> 00:43:31,059
Do I need to do it all the way
to the floor?

764
00:43:31,439 --> 00:43:34,667
He just needs to raise his arms, right?
He doesn't need to go all the way down?

765
00:43:34,668 --> 00:43:36,132
Okay.

766
00:43:36,133 --> 00:43:39,086
- Really?
- Just do the splits, and raise your arms.

767
00:43:39,087 --> 00:43:40,914
- I can just use my strength to hold it?
- That's right.

768
00:43:40,915 --> 00:43:43,389
- That's right.
- Just don't fall over, no matter what.

769
00:43:43,390 --> 00:43:45,355
Nice... nice!

770
00:43:46,796 --> 00:43:48,490
Nice, nice, nice!

771
00:43:48,491 --> 00:43:50,316
[Wow! He did it?]

772
00:43:53,369 --> 00:43:57,267
[Just what will Yeon Jae's judgment be?]

773
00:43:57,268 --> 00:43:59,152
How can you say that it's no good
just because I didn't touch the ground!

774
00:44:00,341 --> 00:44:04,293
- Yeon Jae, you tell us.
- Well, the thing is, originally...

775
00:44:04,294 --> 00:44:05,848
[Originally?]

776
00:44:07,257 --> 00:44:09,391
Originally, this is what you had to do...

777
00:44:10,732 --> 00:44:14,016
[Then you're not acknowledging it
because he didn't touch the ground?]

778
00:44:14,017 --> 00:44:16,660
- You were supposed to touch the ground.
- That's what it was originally. Originally.

779
00:44:16,661 --> 00:44:19,688
Yeon Jae says this was what it
was originally.

780
00:44:19,689 --> 00:44:21,729
[The judgment call is that it's to be
what it was originally supposed to be...]

781
00:44:21,730 --> 00:44:23,796
Since it had to be done
the way it was originally shown to us...

782
00:44:23,797 --> 00:44:26,852
Beating Son Yeon Jae was a fail.
Son Yeon Jae wins!

783
00:44:29,294 --> 00:44:30,574
There's no way for us to beat you.

784
00:44:30,575 --> 00:44:33,371
[4 marbles times 2= 8. Wins 8 marbles!]

785
00:44:33,372 --> 00:44:34,541
Don't you think it's funny?

786
00:44:34,666 --> 00:44:36,430
What she should do...

787
00:44:36,431 --> 00:44:39,248
[Tae Hwan's flexibility
even Yeon Jae was surprised by.]

788
00:44:39,249 --> 00:44:43,017
[Thought she was going to acknowledge his
win, but pulls out 'actually, originally...']

789
00:44:43,486 --> 00:44:47,480
Since she feels too bad to say that it's not,
and she can't say that he didn't win...

790
00:44:47,481 --> 00:44:49,679
Since Tae Hwan is so much better
than she expected...

791
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:51,799
[Even though he did great,
originally, that wasn't it.]

792
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:53,713
- Originally...
- Originally...

793
00:44:53,714 --> 00:44:56,948
There was no way we could've beat her.
[I shouldn't have played...]

794
00:44:56,949 --> 00:45:00,036
It would be nice if it was something
that I could participate in.

795
00:45:00,037 --> 00:45:02,792
- Put as much water in your mouth as you can.
- What is that?

796
00:45:02,793 --> 00:45:04,753
[Put as much water in your mouth
as you can?]

797
00:45:04,754 --> 00:45:06,039
[Quickly raising up his hand.]

798
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:08,021
Hey, how can we measure the amount?

799
00:45:08,022 --> 00:45:11,428
- Open up a full water bottle...
- With a full water bottle?

800
00:45:11,429 --> 00:45:13,864
To see who can pour most water
in their mouth without swallowing.

801
00:45:13,865 --> 00:45:17,669
- Then this will be over in just one try?
- Ah, hold it in your mouth?

802
00:45:17,670 --> 00:45:20,241
[All the participants to do it
all at once.]

803
00:45:20,242 --> 00:45:21,440
This is really weird.

804
00:45:21,987 --> 00:45:27,423
But Yeon Jae just said very quietly,
'This is really weird...'

805
00:45:28,008 --> 00:45:29,453
What's so weird about it?

806
00:45:30,501 --> 00:45:34,474
- Everyone drink it at the same time...
- This is really weird...

807
00:45:35,038 --> 00:45:36,807
[Yeon Jae unable to understand this game.]

808
00:45:36,808 --> 00:45:41,230
Yeon Jae...
this isn't a game that we usually do.

809
00:45:41,231 --> 00:45:44,556
- This is our first time playing this too.
- But games like this can happen routinely.

810
00:45:45,627 --> 00:45:48,034
<i>We'll make the judgment
after the count of three.</i>

811
00:45:48,035 --> 00:45:50,832
- Okay.
- But we can't hold our hand to the mouth?

812
00:45:50,833 --> 00:45:51,909
No, you can't do that.

813
00:45:51,910 --> 00:45:53,436
Even if the slightest bit of water
slips out, then you're eliminated.

814
00:45:53,617 --> 00:45:56,003
If the water even slips out,
then it's elimination. Keep that in mind.

815
00:45:56,004 --> 00:45:58,103
- Really?
- I'm going to bet four.

816
00:45:58,104 --> 00:46:00,122
If you swallow any water, or if any
slips out, then you're disqualified.

817
00:46:00,439 --> 00:46:02,092
Song Ji Hyo...

818
00:46:02,093 --> 00:46:04,299
I'm going to sit this one out.

819
00:46:05,470 --> 00:46:08,372
I thought you were deciding to go for it
when you took your glasses off.

820
00:46:09,147 --> 00:46:11,596
- I'll take the challenge.
- You keep participating in everything.

821
00:46:11,597 --> 00:46:12,668
Of course.

822
00:46:12,669 --> 00:46:15,883
- I'm going to have to do this one too.
- One thing I do is participate.

823
00:46:16,197 --> 00:46:18,238
- Son Yeon Jae?
- I'm not doing it.

824
00:46:18,239 --> 00:46:20,213
- You're not doing it?
- Just do it, Yeon Jae. Please?

825
00:46:20,214 --> 00:46:22,542
No... it's too weird.

826
00:46:22,543 --> 00:46:25,242
- She says it's too weird!
- What are you saying is so weird?

827
00:46:25,733 --> 00:46:27,213
I'm going to participate.

828
00:46:28,122 --> 00:46:30,248
You have to participate in things like this.

829
00:46:30,249 --> 00:46:32,901
- How much is everyone betting?
- I'm going to bet one.

830
00:46:33,182 --> 00:46:35,567
- It's just water.
- I have a very small mouth.

831
00:46:35,568 --> 00:46:37,461
- I'm going to do it and bet one.
- Tae Hwan says his mouth is too small.

832
00:46:37,675 --> 00:46:41,758
<i>Song Ji Hyo, please be the referee
and be very fair about it.</i>

833
00:46:41,759 --> 00:46:44,376
<i>And Park Tae Hwan and can from his side.</i>

834
00:46:44,377 --> 00:46:46,388
<i>Son Yeon Jae can help with it too.</i>

835
00:46:46,578 --> 00:46:51,140
[The weird game of putting as much water in
your mouth as you can is one simple round!]

836
00:46:51,583 --> 00:46:53,326
[Overflowing nervousness.]

837
00:46:53,327 --> 00:46:55,558
Why am I getting so nervous?
This is nothing!

838
00:46:55,559 --> 00:46:57,161
Seriously, why am I so nervous?

839
00:46:57,162 --> 00:47:00,410
Why am I getting so nervous
over these silly marbles?

840
00:47:00,411 --> 00:47:03,997
<i>I think this is going to hurt
my self-confidence if I lose.</i>

841
00:47:03,998 --> 00:47:05,671
<i>Set, go!</i>

842
00:47:07,131 --> 00:47:08,412
<i>Go!</i>

843
00:47:15,659 --> 00:47:17,263
Kwang Soo swallowed it.
Kwang Soo!

844
00:47:19,537 --> 00:47:20,673
[The swallow that can be seen
by his bobbing Adam's apple.]

845
00:47:20,674 --> 00:47:22,397
Kwang Soo's Adam's apple moved.

846
00:47:24,830 --> 00:47:26,281
[The water is dribbling out.]
His water...

847
00:47:33,124 --> 00:47:34,582
[Gary also poured in the water in excess.]

848
00:47:37,976 --> 00:47:39,810
Someone save me!

849
00:47:40,487 --> 00:47:42,224
[Impala brother also explodes.]

850
00:47:43,452 --> 00:47:46,112
What the heck is this?
Why are we doing this?

851
00:47:47,038 --> 00:47:52,075
- What is this?
- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

852
00:47:52,355 --> 00:47:53,509
[Time over.]

853
00:47:53,510 --> 00:47:55,169
<i>Put your water bottle down.</i>

854
00:47:55,170 --> 00:47:57,359
<i>The people left remaining can
put them down.</i>

855
00:47:57,508 --> 00:47:59,303
I'm eliminated, right?

856
00:47:59,403 --> 00:48:00,883
- Is he eliminated?
- Yes.

857
00:48:03,457 --> 00:48:05,866
Yeon Jae... seriously...

858
00:48:07,098 --> 00:48:09,127
I was pretty good at it too.

859
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:13,531
- You lost!
- Didn't I win?

860
00:48:13,961 --> 00:48:16,577
- I think Kwang Soo swallowed a little.
- I think he really did swallow some.

861
00:48:16,578 --> 00:48:20,474
- How was Kwang Soo?
- His Adam's apple moved twice.

862
00:48:20,475 --> 00:48:22,993
[The referee rules that
his Adam's apple moved twice.]

863
00:48:22,994 --> 00:48:24,532
No, no, no!

864
00:48:25,087 --> 00:48:27,056
My Adam's apple didn't move!

865
00:48:27,855 --> 00:48:30,696
[Video replay]

866
00:48:31,127 --> 00:48:33,091
Kwang Soo swallowed, Kwang Soo.

867
00:48:35,465 --> 00:48:37,530
[And one more time.]

868
00:48:39,090 --> 00:48:41,165
No! It just moved! I didn't swallow.

869
00:48:41,553 --> 00:48:45,467
- Yes! I won!
- You're saying it moved not once, but twice?

870
00:48:45,727 --> 00:48:48,283
- Your Adam's apple moved twice.
- It was worth the challenge.

871
00:48:48,284 --> 00:48:49,481
Okay!

872
00:48:49,482 --> 00:48:52,511
That was a beautiful challenge for you,
whom always participated in the games.

873
00:48:52,512 --> 00:48:53,913
You just need to give me two.

874
00:48:53,914 --> 00:48:58,291
I haven't won a single one yet.
Why don't we play a final round?

875
00:48:58,292 --> 00:49:00,918
Yeon Jae has the most right now,
and we...

876
00:49:01,329 --> 00:49:03,429
- Even if I bet it all, it's not enough.
- Even if we bet everything, it's not enough.

877
00:49:03,430 --> 00:49:06,687
Then... let's pick the best one
out of these.

878
00:49:06,688 --> 00:49:08,028
It's time to choose.

879
00:49:09,053 --> 00:49:11,209
Chicken fight.
I don't think this is good.

880
00:49:11,210 --> 00:49:13,518
[Chicken fight recommender]

881
00:49:14,775 --> 00:49:17,320
Seriously...
you have no conscience, do you?

882
00:49:17,321 --> 00:49:20,390
When we have Son Yeon Jae
and Ji Hyo here...

883
00:49:20,391 --> 00:49:22,083
You were going to play chicken fight
against Yeon Jae?

884
00:49:22,084 --> 00:49:23,647
I doubt Yeon Jae would've participated.

885
00:49:23,648 --> 00:49:25,175
Seriously... not this one.

886
00:49:27,015 --> 00:49:29,323
Guess who's face it is
while blindfolded?

887
00:49:30,469 --> 00:49:33,766
[This is definitely...
Experienced Blank Ji...]

888
00:49:34,324 --> 00:49:37,523
- Holding breath.
- Don't do it, it's Park Tae Hwan.

889
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:44,090
[Definitely wrote in what they're
good at.]

890
00:49:44,091 --> 00:49:45,438
- Tae Hwan, I'm sorry.
- I can't do it.

891
00:49:46,296 --> 00:49:48,687
- How can we do the breath holding?
- Tae Hwan, I'm sorry.

892
00:49:48,688 --> 00:49:51,645
Seriously... Yeon Jae's stretching,
and your breath holding.

893
00:49:52,562 --> 00:49:54,753
[They both proposed the one thing that
they're the best at in the world.]

894
00:49:55,755 --> 00:49:59,657
Draw a line and see
who gets closest with their marble.

895
00:49:59,658 --> 00:50:01,387
- Let's go with this one.
- Let's hold onto that one.

896
00:50:01,388 --> 00:50:04,502
- Then let's go with this one.
- Everyone can play this game.

897
00:50:04,503 --> 00:50:07,820
- Then... let's go with this one.
- Cola Cider.

898
00:50:07,821 --> 00:50:09,928
<i>Okay, I'll explain the rules
of the game.</i>

899
00:50:10,872 --> 00:50:12,787
If you are touching the line, it's cider.

900
00:50:12,788 --> 00:50:14,965
And if you're right on the line, it's cola.

901
00:50:14,966 --> 00:50:18,855
- Does that even happen?
- But... if you go over, then it's out.

902
00:50:18,856 --> 00:50:23,111
Then since I'm the referee,
I'll stand here and make the calls.

903
00:50:23,112 --> 00:50:25,309
Please tell us the order
of who's going to go first.

904
00:50:25,310 --> 00:50:27,833
First up is Yoo Jae Suk.

905
00:50:28,946 --> 00:50:31,509
- Why am I the first to go?
- Because you're the first one.

906
00:50:32,341 --> 00:50:34,462
Is there a need for a different reason?

907
00:50:35,815 --> 00:50:37,560
[Jae Suk, the first to take the challenge.]

908
00:50:38,918 --> 00:50:40,334
Foul!

909
00:50:40,335 --> 00:50:42,334
- We can't kneel down like that?
- He gets a foul for being so ugly.

910
00:50:43,006 --> 00:50:45,098
Do it with a nice expression
on your face.

911
00:50:45,099 --> 00:50:46,833
- With a nice expression.
- Then I can't play?

912
00:50:48,999 --> 00:50:51,152
[One more time with a nicer expression...]

913
00:50:53,473 --> 00:50:55,058
Don't try to do it too well.

914
00:50:55,059 --> 00:50:57,365
Why are you trying so hard?

915
00:50:58,271 --> 00:51:02,277
[Throwing it towards the line...]

916
00:51:03,493 --> 00:51:07,176
[Cola? Cider?]

917
00:51:07,177 --> 00:51:09,410
[Out...]
Out!

918
00:51:10,238 --> 00:51:13,340
- I'll do it again. I'll do it again.
- Why?

919
00:51:13,341 --> 00:51:14,951
Please let me do it again one more time.

920
00:51:14,952 --> 00:51:16,642
Let me do it one more time.

921
00:51:17,143 --> 00:51:19,526
- You can't do that!
- You can't let him. No way.

922
00:51:19,527 --> 00:51:21,279
[Jae Suk - Disqualified]

923
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:22,186
- Okay, disqualified!
- Disqualified.

924
00:51:22,187 --> 00:51:23,442
Give me back me kneeling down
to you earlier.

925
00:51:23,443 --> 00:51:25,766
- What?
- Give me back my kneeling down!

926
00:51:25,767 --> 00:51:27,411
I didn't accept it!

927
00:51:27,412 --> 00:51:29,634
- Give it back. Give it back to me.
- I didn't accept it!

928
00:51:29,635 --> 00:51:32,231
Since you owe me a debt,
give me your knee later.

929
00:51:35,235 --> 00:51:36,714
You have to give it back to me.

930
00:51:36,715 --> 00:51:38,360
You can give it to me later.

931
00:51:39,232 --> 00:51:42,516
- Even when I look at it...
- The next up is Ji Suk Jin.

932
00:51:42,517 --> 00:51:45,104
- Why is it me?
- I shouldn't have gone first!

933
00:51:45,105 --> 00:51:46,398
This isn't easy.

934
00:51:46,399 --> 00:51:49,049
It's nerve wrecking because
you only get one chance.

935
00:51:53,660 --> 00:51:55,944
[Suk Jin's pebble stopping
a way's before the line.]

936
00:51:55,945 --> 00:51:57,136
I want to do it again.

937
00:51:57,462 --> 00:52:02,141
- Suk Jin, you have to give a little force.
- I didn't want to go over the line.

938
00:52:02,142 --> 00:52:04,691
The next up is... Lee Kwang Soo.

939
00:52:04,692 --> 00:52:06,332
If you go past the line, you're out.

940
00:52:10,205 --> 00:52:13,481
[Pretty close!]

941
00:52:14,883 --> 00:52:17,649
- Next... Kim Jong Kook.
- Yes!

942
00:52:18,064 --> 00:52:19,439
You have to be daring, Jong Kook.

943
00:52:20,171 --> 00:52:21,873
Did you just call out your own name?

944
00:52:23,347 --> 00:52:26,260
- Why would you call out your own name?
- Why?

945
00:52:26,261 --> 00:52:31,070
- You're making Yeon Jae feel embarrassed.
- You have to pep yourself up sometimes.

946
00:52:31,071 --> 00:52:32,973
[Just what will Coach Kook's skills be?]

947
00:52:36,766 --> 00:52:38,135
I think it's going to go over...

948
00:52:41,601 --> 00:52:42,649
<i>I think it's going to go over...</i>

949
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:46,932
What the heck is that?

950
00:52:46,933 --> 00:52:50,339
- What the heck?
- Ugh, seriously...

951
00:52:50,809 --> 00:52:53,518
I told you that you have to be
somewhat bold.

952
00:52:54,465 --> 00:52:56,339
Kang Gary.

953
00:52:56,340 --> 00:52:59,446
- You just need to hit this one.
- How can he do that?

954
00:52:59,447 --> 00:53:00,903
Hit it, hit it.

955
00:53:02,669 --> 00:53:04,400
I have to be somewhat bold...

956
00:53:04,703 --> 00:53:06,400
Hey, are you copying me?

957
00:53:06,401 --> 00:53:07,980
[Copy? Isn't that Coach Kook's
self-mantra?]

958
00:53:08,015 --> 00:53:10,175
You have to be bold.
You have to be somewhat bold with this.

959
00:53:10,176 --> 00:53:11,573
You can't be too weak with it.

960
00:53:13,367 --> 00:53:15,512
[What the...]

961
00:53:15,513 --> 00:53:18,337
- It's not easy to be bold.
- Song Ji Hyo.

962
00:53:18,868 --> 00:53:20,985
[The next up is Blank Ji.]

963
00:53:20,986 --> 00:53:22,824
- Go for it.
- That won't be good.

964
00:53:25,215 --> 00:53:27,870
[Throwing it with a little force.]

965
00:53:28,313 --> 00:53:29,434
[Currently, Jong Kook is in first place.]

966
00:53:36,584 --> 00:53:39,623
[Ah... unfortunately, it's out!]

967
00:53:39,624 --> 00:53:41,777
You should've hit it!

968
00:53:41,864 --> 00:53:45,746
- Why should she have hit it?
- Ji Hyo, you should've knocked it out!

969
00:53:45,747 --> 00:53:47,958
[Not wanting to see Mr. Capable
place first even in a game.]

970
00:53:48,594 --> 00:53:50,680
Son Yeon Jae.

971
00:53:50,681 --> 00:53:53,289
- Yeon Jae, Yeon Jae...
- Why am I always the last one to go?

972
00:53:53,290 --> 00:53:56,047
- Don't throw it, but shove it.
- Like this?

973
00:53:56,048 --> 00:53:57,255
Yeah.

974
00:53:58,622 --> 00:54:00,180
[Just what will happen?]

975
00:54:01,039 --> 00:54:03,843
[Sliding towards the line.]

976
00:54:03,844 --> 00:54:05,897
[Will it shove Jong Kook's pebble out?]

977
00:54:05,898 --> 00:54:08,336
[Or will be it out on its own?]

978
00:54:10,358 --> 00:54:12,691
[What! That is?]

979
00:54:12,692 --> 00:54:14,896
[Yeon Jae's pebble touching the line!]

980
00:54:17,816 --> 00:54:19,905
- It didn't go out?
- No, it's touching the line.

981
00:54:19,906 --> 00:54:21,372
This is cider. Cider!

982
00:54:21,373 --> 00:54:23,672
[That is cider.]

983
00:54:23,932 --> 00:54:26,509
- Yeon Jae...
- Wow!

984
00:54:26,510 --> 00:54:28,495
[Yeon Jae climbing up to first place.]

985
00:54:28,496 --> 00:54:31,617
Jong Kook is arguing
that it went over the line.

986
00:54:32,669 --> 00:54:35,683
Originally...
originally, this isn't what it was.

987
00:54:35,684 --> 00:54:38,277
- What do you mean? This is right.
- I told you originally, didn't I?

988
00:54:40,380 --> 00:54:43,204
And lastly, Park Tae Hwan.

989
00:54:43,205 --> 00:54:45,077
With him being the last,
I'm getting really nervous.

990
00:54:45,889 --> 00:54:48,180
But Yeon Jae...
wow... Yeon Jae really is something.

991
00:54:48,181 --> 00:54:49,849
He is seriously envious of her right now.

992
00:54:49,850 --> 00:54:53,655
- Will it be better to do it like this?
- Shove it on the floor.

993
00:54:53,656 --> 00:54:57,173
If he does this and it doesn't work,
he's going to ask for a do over.

994
00:54:57,174 --> 00:54:58,723
He is totally your style then.

995
00:55:00,219 --> 00:55:02,337
[The power brothers with so much
in common.]

996
00:55:03,461 --> 00:55:05,848
They really are so similar...

997
00:55:09,478 --> 00:55:11,478
[To where all the pebbles
are sitting gathered.]

998
00:55:16,437 --> 00:55:18,877
If you had put a little more force behind it,
it would've pushed mine up.

999
00:55:18,878 --> 00:55:21,959
- Ha Ha is the last one now.
- Ah, Ha Ha is still left to go.

1000
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:24,586
- Ha Ha still has to go.
- You can do it... cola.

1001
00:55:31,264 --> 00:55:33,027
[he did hit a pebble out of there!]

1002
00:55:33,028 --> 00:55:35,039
- He didn't get anything.
- Did you shove mine out?

1003
00:55:36,515 --> 00:55:38,862
[Jong Kook's pebble that's been
pushed out.]

1004
00:55:38,863 --> 00:55:40,382
Jong Kook... disqualified.

1005
00:55:42,354 --> 00:55:46,308
The winner of our morning's indoor games...
Yeon Jae!

1006
00:55:46,309 --> 00:55:49,035
<i>- She really did great.
- She's pretty good!</i>

1007
00:55:55,037 --> 00:55:56,465
[The battlefield inside the hurricane.]

1008
00:55:56,466 --> 00:55:59,336
['D' high school in Pocheon!]

1009
00:55:59,337 --> 00:56:04,151
[Yeon Jae with most marbles earned from
the morning mission is first to enter.]

1010
00:56:04,899 --> 00:56:07,981
- You need to choose a card.
- Just one?

1011
00:56:07,982 --> 00:56:12,042
This is your final mission location.
[Why a card all of a sudden?]

1012
00:56:12,673 --> 00:56:17,261
[Just what is the meaning behind
these cards?]

1013
00:56:20,701 --> 00:56:24,990
[Enter in the order of winning earlier,
and choose a card.]

1014
00:56:32,439 --> 00:56:37,845
[A number on the cards...
just what is the meaning behind them?]

1015
00:56:39,179 --> 00:56:42,090
This kind of looks like my old school?

1016
00:56:42,091 --> 00:56:43,446
Is this not it?

1017
00:56:51,968 --> 00:56:53,404
That's me.

1018
00:56:54,913 --> 00:56:56,251
This is my alma mater.

1019
00:56:59,285 --> 00:57:00,962
<i>Mike testing...</i>

1020
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:02,343
I can hear something.

1021
00:57:02,344 --> 00:57:06,956
<i>[We would first like to thank all the students
and participants for helping with the filming.]</i>

1022
00:57:07,501 --> 00:57:09,765
<i>I will now tell you the rules of the game.</i>

1023
00:57:10,081 --> 00:57:17,717
<i>[Today's mission is...
to rip off the numbered name tags.]</i>

1024
00:57:17,718 --> 00:57:19,589
Rip off numbered name tags?

1025
00:57:19,936 --> 00:57:23,201
<i>You have to rip off the name tags
in the order of the number you picked.</i>

1026
00:57:23,202 --> 00:57:26,964
[The hunt starts by the numbers
that they've each chosen.]

1027
00:57:26,965 --> 00:57:30,024
[This is the secret behind the
card's numbers.]

1028
00:57:31,038 --> 00:57:35,244
<i>[The first target is...]</i>

1029
00:57:35,793 --> 00:57:37,560
<i>[Number 9!]</i>

1030
00:57:37,912 --> 00:57:41,528
[Find the number nine tag,
and oust the person.]

1031
00:57:42,478 --> 00:57:46,478
[Just moments prior]
I feel an energy emanating from this one!

1032
00:57:49,287 --> 00:57:51,912
[Mr. Capable choosing card number 9.]

1033
00:57:52,899 --> 00:57:55,671
<i>You need to oust number 9.</i>

1034
00:57:55,672 --> 00:57:57,869
Why is number 9 first?

1035
00:57:57,870 --> 00:58:03,118
[This target hunting starts from number 9
and works its way down to number one]

1036
00:58:03,119 --> 00:58:05,691
<i>Once number 9 is ousted,
your next target is number 8.</i>

1037
00:58:05,692 --> 00:58:06,724
[Big-nosed brother with number 8.]

1038
00:58:07,048 --> 00:58:08,100
It should be 1, 2, 3, 4...

1039
00:58:08,101 --> 00:58:10,166
<i>The person who's become the target...</i>

1040
00:58:10,668 --> 00:58:15,050
<i>can rip off someone else's name tag
and switch out your numbers with them.</i>

1041
00:58:15,051 --> 00:58:19,270
[If you become the target,
take someone else's name tag!]

1042
00:58:19,271 --> 00:58:23,944
<i>[Also... there's a secret opportunity that'll
be revealed once the allotted time is up.]</i>

1043
00:58:23,945 --> 00:58:25,048
<i>Thus, do not let your guard down.</i>

1044
00:58:25,049 --> 00:58:26,813
Then we have to eliminate number 9
first no matter what?

1045
00:58:26,814 --> 00:58:30,029
But number 9 can target me too?

1046
00:58:30,030 --> 00:58:31,159
[However, number 9 can come
gunning for you too!]

1047
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:34,945
<i>[I will announce your first target,
number 9.]</i>

1048
00:58:34,946 --> 00:58:36,106
He's going to announce who it is?

1049
00:58:37,012 --> 00:58:40,739
[Revealing of target number 9,
Kim Jong Kook]

1050
00:58:40,740 --> 00:58:45,395
[Target hunting - Target number 9.
Attack Kim Jong Kook]

1051
00:58:45,396 --> 00:58:47,324
[Cheers of joy!]

1052
00:58:47,325 --> 00:58:51,738
[The opportunity for all 8
to get Mr. Capable!]

1053
00:58:51,739 --> 00:58:54,136
- Nice, nice...
- He's the first to go to jail for once!

1054
00:58:54,567 --> 00:58:56,205
- Get Kim Jong Kook!
- Get him!

1055
00:58:57,040 --> 00:59:00,771
But we have to go around together since
Jong kook can get one of our name tags too.

1056
00:59:00,772 --> 00:59:02,442
If Jong Kook gets one of ours,
then we're the ones to get ousted.

1057
00:59:03,306 --> 00:59:04,981
This is awesome.

1058
00:59:04,982 --> 00:59:08,451
- This really is awesome.
- Awesome... wow! Awesome!

1059
00:59:10,267 --> 00:59:14,700
[Target hunting.
Target number 9 - Kim Jong Kook]

1060
00:59:21,357 --> 00:59:24,361
[Even though he's Mr. Capable...]

1061
00:59:24,490 --> 00:59:29,294
[Will he be able to survive against eight?]

1062
00:59:33,842 --> 00:59:37,370
[Nervousness...]

1063
00:59:41,138 --> 00:59:43,831
I just need one person to walk in here.

1064
00:59:44,521 --> 00:59:46,340
If I can just get one person...

1065
00:59:46,341 --> 00:59:50,393
[He needs to rip off someone else's name tag
and switch out the numbers to survive longer]

1066
00:59:51,360 --> 00:59:53,832
<i>I'm really... nervous right now.</i>

1067
00:59:55,462 --> 00:59:56,626
What?

1068
00:59:57,172 --> 00:59:59,732
- Why don't you show this to me?
- What?

1069
00:59:59,733 --> 01:00:01,236
- This project.
- What is it?

1070
01:00:01,237 --> 01:00:02,845
Betrayal.

1071
01:00:03,164 --> 01:00:06,879
[A textbook-like project to the Giraffe,
the king of betrayal]

1072
01:00:08,979 --> 01:00:14,922
[Can't let their guard down!]
[In search of number 9, Kim Jong Kook]

1073
01:00:16,192 --> 01:00:20,932
[Just then...
a very passive Big-nosed brother...]

1074
01:00:20,933 --> 01:00:25,001
[Since if number 9 Jong Kook is ousted,
him being number 8 is the target...]

1075
01:00:25,002 --> 01:00:27,717
I need to look for an
opportunity to ambush someone too.

1076
01:00:28,859 --> 01:00:30,995
[I'm next...]

1077
01:00:41,635 --> 01:00:45,919
[Number 9, Mr. Capable not able to
step out like he did earlier.]

1078
01:01:09,721 --> 01:01:11,694
[Target number 9,
Jong Kook in extreme danger!]

1079
01:01:17,595 --> 01:01:22,588
[Tae Hwan just passing by without
checking out the inside of the room.]

1080
01:01:25,534 --> 01:01:28,646
[He has to catch someone to escape
his predicament of being the target...]

1081
01:01:28,647 --> 01:01:30,531
I have to somehow get someone
no matter what.

1082
01:01:32,597 --> 01:01:34,354
Did he just go home?

1083
01:01:35,895 --> 01:01:37,690
You have to protect me.

1084
01:01:38,774 --> 01:01:40,114
Thanks.

1085
01:01:42,904 --> 01:01:46,241
[Second round of danger.
This time, it's Ha Ha and Yeon Jae...]

1086
01:01:50,645 --> 01:01:52,268
What if he's in here somewhere?

1087
01:02:08,388 --> 01:02:10,805
[Target number 9 Jong Kook
flees outside!]

1088
01:02:10,806 --> 01:02:14,840
[Number 9 Jong Kook the beast
eyeing others!]

1089
01:02:14,841 --> 01:02:17,749
- Over here! Over here! Third floor!
- Third floor!

1090
01:02:21,344 --> 01:02:23,314
What? Where?

1091
01:02:24,214 --> 01:02:28,508
[Others are headed to where the fight
is after hearing all the noise!]

1092
01:02:28,509 --> 01:02:30,215
Where? Gary!

1093
01:02:30,216 --> 01:02:32,756
[Spectacular scene of number 9's hunting!]

1094
01:02:32,757 --> 01:02:35,304
[Definitely Mr. Capable.
A target not easily giving in...]

1095
01:02:35,841 --> 01:02:38,586
[If Jong kook can tear the name off of
one of them, he can live too!]

1096
01:02:38,587 --> 01:02:39,942
Over here!

1097
01:02:39,943 --> 01:02:43,707
[Just then!]

1098
01:02:45,460 --> 01:02:47,087
[Third floor!]

1099
01:02:47,088 --> 01:02:49,377
I'll go get them.

1100
01:02:50,637 --> 01:02:52,729
Yeon Jae, hurry up!
You can't walk slowly like that.

1101
01:02:53,507 --> 01:02:55,078
Over here!

1102
01:02:55,079 --> 01:02:56,768
Over here!

1103
01:02:56,769 --> 01:03:00,306
- Up, up. Upstairs!
- Where? Where are you?

1104
01:03:00,307 --> 01:03:02,936
[If you take too long, someone will
be had. Hurry!]

1105
01:03:02,937 --> 01:03:05,007
- Is it over here?
- This is where all the noise came from.

1106
01:03:07,119 --> 01:03:11,617
[Next target, number 8 Suk Jin,
no longer following behind them.]

1107
01:03:11,618 --> 01:03:14,175
[Escaping to somewhere
far away from the action.]

1108
01:03:14,176 --> 01:03:15,985
I think I'm...

1109
01:03:16,736 --> 01:03:21,676
[Mr. Capable still holding out.]

1110
01:03:21,677 --> 01:03:24,149
[That stamina! That strength!]

1111
01:03:24,150 --> 01:03:26,502
Hurry up and get here! Hurry!

1112
01:03:28,980 --> 01:03:30,390
He's here!

1113
01:03:30,519 --> 01:03:33,929
[Finally all the members have
gathered at the hunting ground!]

1114
01:03:34,849 --> 01:03:37,550
[But he's somehow still holding out...]

1115
01:03:39,870 --> 01:03:43,417
[Finding himself at a disadvantage,
Mr. Capable sticks his name tag to the ground.]

1116
01:03:46,079 --> 01:03:48,607
[All the attacking hunters!]

1117
01:03:54,624 --> 01:03:56,825
Do it quickly! Do it quickly!

1118
01:03:57,449 --> 01:03:59,855
Do it quickly! Do it quickly!

1119
01:04:00,390 --> 01:04:01,834
[Oh my goodness...]

1120
01:04:02,844 --> 01:04:07,185
[Marine Boy Tae Hwan stepping up
to get the name tag!]

1121
01:04:12,069 --> 01:04:16,677
<i>[Number 9, Kim Jong Kook, out.
Kim Jong Kook, out]</i>

1122
01:04:16,678 --> 01:04:19,805
But... where did Mr. Ji Suk Jin go?

1123
01:04:19,806 --> 01:04:24,736
<i>The next target is number 8,
Ji Suk Jin.</i>

1124
01:04:24,736 --> 01:04:28,434
[Big-nosed brother escaping the
danger early.]

1125
01:04:28,435 --> 01:04:31,142
I'm seriously about to go crazy.

1126
01:04:31,143 --> 01:04:34,103
<i>The next target is number 8,
Ji Suk Jin.</i>

1127
01:04:34,104 --> 01:04:37,761
<i>The next target is number 8,
Ji Suk Jin.</i>

1128
01:04:40,198 --> 01:04:41,670
This is seriously driving me crazy.

1129
01:04:42,402 --> 01:04:45,639
I seriously don't want to
just lose easily today.

1130
01:04:49,427 --> 01:04:51,789
[His personal VJ in the hideout too?]

1131
01:04:52,956 --> 01:04:57,407
[Continuing to film from
the closet from across the room.]

1132
01:04:57,408 --> 01:05:01,976
[Will he... be able to
survive for long in there?]

1133
01:05:04,578 --> 01:05:09,048
Why has everyone become so relaxed since
number 8 Suk Jin has been announced?

1134
01:05:09,049 --> 01:05:12,392
[Everyone looking so relaxed after it being
revealed that Ji Suk Jin is number 8.]

1135
01:05:13,240 --> 01:05:18,610
So that why when we were searching earlier,
Suk Jin wasn't really being serious about it.

1136
01:05:19,397 --> 01:05:21,662
When we came up
to the third floor earlier by ourselves...

1137
01:05:21,663 --> 01:05:25,268
He kept opening and closing the door
to the same room by himself.

1138
01:05:25,868 --> 01:05:30,361
I bet he's in there. Let's go.
[Obviously hiding out in that room.]

1139
01:05:30,362 --> 01:05:32,681
There's no reason for us all
to even go.

1140
01:05:33,515 --> 01:05:39,472
[But... wait a minute...]

1141
01:05:39,473 --> 01:05:44,144

[I'll be up next... what do I do?]

1144
01:05:56,573 --> 01:05:58,485
There's no way you can film me
in this situation.

1145
01:05:58,486 --> 01:06:00,735

You can see me?

[Ace Ji Hyo discovering
Big-nosed brother's camera by chance!]

1152

1153
01:06:50,785 --> 01:06:53,300

1159
01:07:25,326 --> 01:07:27,335

- I should've torn his name off.

1162
01:07:35,553 --> 01:07:40,014

he attacks as if he's been waiting for it.]

1171

[Tae Hwan gains Ji Hyo's number 1!]

1172

[We should've eliminated Tae Hwan
when he was target number 7...]

What do we do?

1177
01:08:50,833 --> 01:08:52,170
If Gary could...

1178
01:08:52,171 --> 01:08:54,815
[If only number 6 Gary could
eliminate Tae Hwan...]

1179

If Gary doesn't get him right now,
then you, Yeon Jae and I...

1180
01:08:58,688 --> 01:09:01,403
We may not even be able to get him
with all of us ganging up on him.

1181
01:09:01,677 --> 01:09:07,653
[The big burden is that
Tae Hwan is number one right now...]

1182

Gary?

1183
01:09:16,480 --> 01:09:22,218
[The simpleton only thinking of
catching Gary right now.]

1184
01:09:25,006 --> 01:09:28,182
[An extremely suspicious looking place.]

1185
01:09:38,057 --> 01:09:39,305
Hey!

[Discovers Target number 6, Gary!]

1187
01:09:42,809 --> 01:09:44,807
- Are you okay? Are you okay?
- Stand still. Just stand still!

1188
01:09:44,808 --> 01:09:49,050
- What are you doing? Get away from me!
- Come on! Come on!

1189
01:09:53,175 --> 01:09:54,515
Already?

1190
01:09:54,516 --> 01:10:00,557
[No! If Ha Ha ousts Gary,
it'll be too hard to oust Tae Hwan!]

1191

- Ha Ha!
- Dong Hoon!

01:10:03,762 --> 01:10:07,018
[The children's cutthroat play.]

1193
01:10:08,661 --> 01:10:13,451
[Anyways, neck and neck. Seems as
though one of the two will be ousted.]

1194
01:10:16,117 --> 01:10:19,093
- Ha Ha... Ha Ha... wait.
- Hurry!

1195
01:10:21,824 --> 01:10:23,422
Listen to me.

1196
01:10:23,922 --> 01:10:26,921
[Gary, rip off Tae Hwan's name.]
Why are you so fast?

1197

[But Gary who doesn't notice the signs...]

1198
01:10:30,431 --> 01:10:32,967
[Seems to notice Jae Suk's name tag...]

1199

What the heck is this when I
just came to explain out plans?

1203
01:10:51,296 --> 01:10:54,380
You should've told me about it sooner!

1204

[Of all people, tearing off number 5
Jae Suk only to become the target again.]

1205

Why? Why again?

1206
01:11:15,409 --> 01:11:18,099
I have no other solution than here.

1207
01:11:18,100 --> 01:11:19,524

- You startled me.
- We're supposed to oust you right now.

1215
01:12:09,367 --> 01:12:13,034
- But Tae Hwan... Tae Hwan is the problem.
- I know.

1216
01:12:13,035 --> 01:12:15,955
I will bring Tae Hwan down here, okay?

1217
01:12:15,956 --> 01:12:18,925
And, look... look.

1218
01:12:18,926 --> 01:12:23,452
- Make it seem like you're in here.
- But I can't go in there.

1219

Kwang Soo, come here.

1220

- Tae Hwan's on the third floor. Third floor.
- Third floor? Come here.

there's no way that any of them can win.</i>

Ha Ha, let me just ask you something.

1277
01:16:31,525 --> 01:16:32,942
You lured me into a trap, didn't you?

1278
01:16:32,943 --> 01:16:35,300
- You lured me into a trap, didn't you?
- No, we all did.

1279
01:16:36,302 --> 01:16:37,705
I knew it.

1280
01:16:37,706 --> 01:16:41,554
You know why you were lured in?
Because you only think about yourself.

1281
01:16:41,828 --> 01:16:44,913
- Because they already have it figured out.
- Hey, what is that?

1282
01:16:45,505 --> 01:16:48,947
[Huh? Reappearance of the cards?
By any chance...]

1283
01:16:48,948 --> 01:16:51,824
I really wish that either Jong Kook
or I can come back to life.

1284
01:16:51,825 --> 01:16:53,698
I think there's a way to come back to life!

- No, don't worry.

Since the order goes this way for now,
let's trust each other and work together.

I doubt that Tae Hwan will get
back out here.

[Come on... no way...]

1301
01:17:46,847 --> 01:17:51,161

- At this rate, our chances aren't low either.

1302
01:17:51,162 --> 01:17:54,819
[A pretty high chance if it's
two people out of the six present.]

1303
01:17:58,324 --> 01:18:01,478
- Can someone else first...
- What did you say?

1304
01:18:02,628 --> 01:18:05,539
- Just go ahead and pick one first.
- Please just do it already.

1305
01:18:05,540 --> 01:18:07,889
You're going to have to pick
sooner or later.

1306
01:18:08,487 --> 01:18:12,191
[Yoo-ruce Willis chooses his card!]

1307
01:18:13,177 --> 01:18:14,933
- Oh my God!
- Is it a resurrection card?

1308
01:18:16,531 --> 01:18:18,405
- Is it a resurrection card?
- Is it a resurrection?

1309
01:18:18,406 --> 01:18:19,665
<i>It's a dud.</i>

1310
01:18:20,331 --> 01:18:22,391
But it has the R sticker on it!

1311
01:18:24,528 --> 01:18:26,194
I thought it was a resurrection card.

1312
01:18:26,195 --> 01:18:29,736
- But it has the 'R' on it!
- But it looks the same front and back.

1313
01:18:29,737 --> 01:18:32,096
[The card that looks the same front
and back is a dud card.]

1314
01:18:33,908 --> 01:18:39,193
- Seriously... that really is so...
- It's not a resurrection, but a resuRRection.

1315
01:18:40,154 --> 01:18:42,374
I have to get out there right now!

1316
01:18:42,375 --> 01:18:47,318
- Please pick the resurrection card!
- If both of you get it, that's huge!

1317
01:18:47,319 --> 01:18:50,296
- It would be nice if one of you got it.
- Just one of you should go, not both.

1318
01:18:50,297 --> 01:18:52,874
But if Jong Kook gets out there,
it's over!

1319
01:18:54,985 --> 01:18:56,089
Did you see that it's different?

1320
01:18:56,090 --> 01:19:00,257
But if you do get the resurrection card,
we'll be cheering and it'll be hell out there.

1321
01:19:07,048 --> 01:19:09,094
- What?
- What is that?

1322
01:19:09,874 --> 01:19:13,683
- They're in big trouble!
- You're saying I got number zero?

1323
01:19:13,684 --> 01:19:15,163
What does number zero mean?

1324
01:19:15,164 --> 01:19:17,548
It means that you've been
resurrected as number zero.

1325
01:19:19,706 --> 01:19:23,035
- Then what happens?
- You're on top!

1326
01:19:23,353 --> 01:19:25,981
[Even above number 1...
The last of the last target!]

1327
01:19:25,982 --> 01:19:28,431
Kwang Soo!
Please do something about Kwang Soo!

1328
01:19:29,105 --> 01:19:31,674
If it's number zero,
isn't it after number one?

1329
01:19:31,675 --> 01:19:33,759
- It's the last one.
- Right?

1330
01:19:33,760 --> 01:19:38,299
[100% real! Kim Jong Kook
resurrected as number zero!]

1331
01:19:40,224 --> 01:19:43,138
Okay... I've got another life.

1332
01:19:43,785 --> 01:19:45,403
I should hide somewhere and wait.

1333
01:19:45,404 --> 01:19:49,217
[The ones left alive still don't know
about my resurrection...]

1334
01:19:49,218 --> 01:19:52,609
[I will get rid of them all one by one.]

1335
01:19:53,105 --> 01:19:57,960
- Now... there are four cards left.
- It'll be fun to see who gets it.

1336
01:19:57,961 --> 01:20:02,015
There's only one of you
who will get resurrected.

1337
01:20:02,016 --> 01:20:07,082
Since there's only one card in here,
all four of you will pick at the same time.

1338
01:20:07,083 --> 01:20:10,614
Jong Kook doesn't know which one
of you is going to be resurrected either.

1339
01:20:10,615 --> 01:20:14,661
- I'm going to pick this one.
- If Ha Ha gets it, it'll be so unfair.

1340
01:20:14,662 --> 01:20:15,910
[Each picking a card of their choosing.]

1341
01:20:18,874 --> 01:20:20,844
- You have to take the one you pointed to.
- Really?

1342
01:20:20,845 --> 01:20:22,997
I'll take this one.

1343
01:20:22,998 --> 01:20:25,330
Okay then, I'll take this one.

1344
01:20:26,195 --> 01:20:27,211
And I take this one?

1345
01:20:28,137 --> 01:20:31,525
<i>Okay... only one of
you is going to get a number.</i>

1346
01:20:31,526 --> 01:20:34,460
<i>That number is number 4.</i>

1347
01:20:35,210 --> 01:20:37,274
- If it's number 4...
- Jong Kook picked the best one then.

1348
01:20:37,275 --> 01:20:41,016
<i>If you get the 4, that person becomes
the target the moment they walk out of here.</i>

1349
01:20:41,017 --> 01:20:44,487
- The moment they walk out of here...
- It's not such a good thing then.

1350
01:20:45,389 --> 01:20:48,696
It may be better to just stay here than
be the target as soon as you get out there.

1351
01:20:48,697 --> 01:20:50,167
No, that's not the case.

1352
01:20:50,168 --> 01:20:51,522
That's not true.

1353
01:20:51,523 --> 01:20:56,496
The person could get out there and gather
everyone and oust Jong Kook.

1354
01:20:56,497 --> 01:20:58,193
You can rip Jong Kook's name off too.

1355
01:20:58,194 --> 01:21:02,049
[Anyways, the person who picked
the resurrection card is?]

1356
01:21:02,050 --> 01:21:04,989
- Let's see who it is.
- You can't see off the camera reflection.

1357
01:21:04,990 --> 01:21:06,599
Okay... 1, 2, 3!

1358
01:21:07,541 --> 01:21:10,380
[Oh... my goodness...]

1359
01:21:11,094 --> 01:21:12,694
Put your arm down first.

1360
01:21:14,031 --> 01:21:15,576
You just stay here.

1361
01:21:15,577 --> 01:21:19,055
[Park Tae Hwan resurrected as number 4!]

1362
01:21:19,056 --> 01:21:21,137
How can things go so well like this?

1363
01:21:21,138 --> 01:21:24,750
- Come here... come here...
- Tae Hwan...

1364
01:21:24,751 --> 01:21:27,130
- You can do this... you can do this.
- Tae Hwan... fighting.

1365
01:21:27,131 --> 01:21:28,966
This is really awesome.

1366
01:21:28,967 --> 01:21:30,576
Tae Hwan was the last to pick, right?

1367
01:21:30,577 --> 01:21:34,917
[Almost like a lie, Mr. Capable and Marine Boy
have both been resurrected!]

1368
01:21:36,297 --> 01:21:40,819
<i>[The next target is number 4,
Park Tae Hwan.]</i>

1369
01:21:40,820 --> 01:21:43,542
<i>[The next target is number 4,
Park Tae Hwan.]</i>

1370
01:21:43,543 --> 01:21:46,758
<i>The next target is number 4,
Park Tae Hwan.</i>

1371
01:21:56,761 --> 01:21:59,781
[Tae Hwan being more calm
after becoming resurrected.]

1372
01:22:03,969 --> 01:22:07,931
[Avoiding the main paths
and listening carefully.]

1373
01:22:11,672 --> 01:22:13,290
I wonder if they're
searching for me right now?

1374
01:22:16,001 --> 01:22:21,246
[If anything, the hunters are
the ones being more cautious.]

1375
01:22:24,426 --> 01:22:26,650
Hey, why are we walking around
in so much fear anyways?

1376
01:22:26,651 --> 01:22:29,410
- Why are we being so afraid?
- There are three of us here.

1377
01:22:29,411 --> 01:22:34,958
[The three not knowing anything else other
than Tae Hwan's resurrection.]

1378
01:22:36,589 --> 01:22:40,776
[Searching in earnest for number 4,
Tae Hwan.]

1379
01:22:50,989 --> 01:22:54,639
[The Giraffe's nightmare.]

1380
01:22:59,632 --> 01:23:03,158
[The sinner who most actively worked
to lure Tae Hwan in earlier.]

1381
01:23:03,652 --> 01:23:06,266
Aren't you going to get Gary?
He's number one.

1382
01:23:06,267 --> 01:23:09,537
Gary was the one who ripped your name off.
Gary is on this floor too somewhere.

1383
01:23:09,538 --> 01:23:11,544
- But you lured me into a trap.
- I didn't lure you in.

1384
01:23:11,545 --> 01:23:13,120
I objected to it the whole time.

1385
01:23:16,638 --> 01:23:18,825
[It's Tae Hwan! What do I do?]

1386
01:23:22,139 --> 01:23:23,231
Did you see?

1387
01:23:23,232 --> 01:23:26,056
- Yeon Jae. Yeon Jae, come out here.
- Yes?

1388
01:23:26,057 --> 01:23:28,602
- Come here.
- Where's Gary? Gary's number one.

1389
01:23:28,603 --> 01:23:30,652
If you don't get him now,
you won't be able to get him.

1390
01:23:30,653 --> 01:23:32,816
Let's get him together. Tae Hwan...

1391
01:23:32,817 --> 01:23:34,840
I don't know what I should do...

1392
01:23:35,345 --> 01:23:37,540
- Yeon Jae, you can just stand over there.
- Really?

1393
01:23:39,023 --> 01:23:41,367
Yeon Jae... just because he tells you to go,
you're really leaving right away?

1394
01:23:43,358 --> 01:23:45,490
I can't fight.

1395
01:23:46,886 --> 01:23:48,379
Of my goodness!

1396
01:23:49,077 --> 01:23:50,751
Oh my goodness!

1397
01:23:51,166 --> 01:23:54,368
[Discovers Mr. Capable,
the other one who was resurrected!]

1398
01:23:54,369 --> 01:23:55,678
Who is it? Is someone there?

1399
01:23:55,679 --> 01:23:58,056
Is someone else there? Who is it?
Who's standing over there?

1400
01:23:58,057 --> 01:24:00,690
[Can only laugh out of shock...]

1401
01:24:00,691 --> 01:24:02,119
Is this even allowed?

1402
01:24:02,120 --> 01:24:03,505
What is it?

1403
01:24:06,339 --> 01:24:08,869
Can't I just go on ahead to jail?

1404
01:24:08,870 --> 01:24:11,587
This is too scary...
it's too bloody out here.

1405
01:24:12,328 --> 01:24:15,992
[Shaking after seeing that
Mr. Capable has been resurrected.]

1406
01:24:18,484 --> 01:24:20,740
It's either you go, or we go, Tae Hwan.

1407
01:24:21,062 --> 01:24:23,147
Listen to carefully...

1408
01:24:23,148 --> 01:24:27,059
Tae Hwan, Tae Hwan! I'll just lie here.
I won't do anything and just lie here!

1409
01:24:27,060 --> 01:24:28,395
I'll just lie here!

1410
01:24:28,866 --> 01:24:32,681
[Gary in danger!
Kwang Soo also in danger!]

1411
01:24:40,096 --> 01:24:43,217
[Just then, the Giraffe springs
a surprise attack on Marine Boy!]

1412
01:24:46,526 --> 01:24:50,699
[With that turn of events,
Gary's name tag is eliminated!]

1413
01:24:50,700 --> 01:24:54,633
<i>[Number 1, Kang Gary, out.
Number 1, Kang Gary, out!]</i>

1414
01:24:54,634 --> 01:24:56,155
Lee Kwang Soo!

1415
01:24:56,156 --> 01:24:57,689
Hey! Lee Kwang Soo!

1416
01:25:04,006 --> 01:25:07,942
[That... that person's been
resurrected too?]

1417
01:25:11,242 --> 01:25:14,483
It's not me... Jong Kook is a
better target in this instance.

1418
01:25:14,484 --> 01:25:17,206
[The next target is number 3, Son Yeon Jae.]
Who?

1419
01:25:17,207 --> 01:25:19,800
[The next target is number 3, Son Yeon Jae.]
Who?

1420
01:25:21,194 --> 01:25:22,393
Who?

1421
01:25:23,450 --> 01:25:25,603
[It's me!]

1422
01:25:25,604 --> 01:25:29,872
[As soon as she becomes the target,
she attacks Kwang Soo!]

1423
01:25:31,828 --> 01:25:35,706
[The best thing for the Giraffe to do first
is to escape the situation.]

1424
01:25:36,649 --> 01:25:38,529
[Even the struggling Gary is imprisoned.]

1425
01:25:38,529 --> 01:25:41,248
- Does your back hurt?
- We've decided that your back doesn't hurt.

1426
01:25:41,249 --> 01:25:43,057
It hurts.

1427
01:25:43,058 --> 01:25:45,350
Even though it hurts, I got a little greedy.

1428
01:25:45,351 --> 01:25:47,857
I got greedy as soon as the game started...

1429
01:25:47,858 --> 01:25:49,365
It hurts...

1430
01:25:51,191 --> 01:25:53,793
Do you know who else has
been resurrected?

1431
01:25:55,254 --> 01:25:57,326
- How did you know?
- I saw him.

1432
01:25:57,327 --> 01:25:59,009
I saw him on my way down here.

1433
01:25:59,010 --> 01:26:01,580
But why aren't they announcing
Jong Kook's resurrection?

1434
01:26:01,581 --> 01:26:03,261
Because he's number zero.

1435
01:26:03,262 --> 01:26:04,638
[Because he's number zero, him being
a target hasn't been announced yet.]

1436
01:26:04,639 --> 01:26:05,839
There's even a number zero?

1437
01:26:06,220 --> 01:26:09,067
- You're saying there's number zero?
- He becomes the target after number 1.

1438
01:26:09,068 --> 01:26:10,133
Don't you think it'll be fun?

1439
01:26:10,133 --> 01:26:12,261
Then I'm glad that I've got mine ripped off,
because I was number one.

1440
01:26:12,262 --> 01:26:14,237
- You were number one?
- Yeah!

1441
01:26:14,238 --> 01:26:17,072
- This is much better to be in here.
- Tae Hwan's number one now?

1442
01:26:17,073 --> 01:26:20,357
- Tae Hwan's number one?
- Then it's Tae Hwan against Jong Kook?

1443
01:26:20,358 --> 01:26:22,000
Can't we go out there to watch since
we haven't done it in a long time?

1444
01:26:22,001 --> 01:26:24,071
Can't we go watch this?

1445
01:26:24,312 --> 01:26:27,738
[Coach Kook and Park Tae Hwan,
a dream match!]

1446
01:26:27,739 --> 01:26:29,271
Tae Hwan is really worked up right
now because of me.

1447
01:26:29,272 --> 01:26:31,106
But Yeon Jae is
the unknown variable right now.

1448
01:26:31,107 --> 01:26:33,673
Because Tae Hwan won't be able to
rip Yeon Jae's name off.

1449
01:26:33,674 --> 01:26:36,730
- But there's Kwang Soo...
- Kwang Soo will tear hers off.

1450
01:26:36,731 --> 01:26:38,759
[But the traitorous Giraffe
won't care who he rips the name off of.]

1451
01:26:42,277 --> 01:26:46,163
[Number 3 Yeon Jae,
going to catch easy Kwang Soo.]

1452
01:26:46,164 --> 01:26:47,835
[Where did he go?]

1453
01:26:52,346 --> 01:26:57,884
[Will she be able to become the dark horse?]

1454
01:27:06,604 --> 01:27:08,711
[The Giraffe's surprise attack!]

1455
01:27:08,712 --> 01:27:12,288
[Closing in on number 3, Yeon Jae!]

1456
01:27:19,356 --> 01:27:23,572
<i>[Number 3, Son Yeon Jae, out.
Number 3, Son Yeon Jae, out.]</i>

1457
01:27:24,631 --> 01:27:26,662
You really startled me...

1458
01:27:28,366 --> 01:27:32,010
Ah, ultimately... Kwang Soo...

1459
01:27:33,617 --> 01:27:36,671
<i>[The next target is number 2,
Lee Kwang Soo.]</i>

1460
01:27:36,672 --> 01:27:40,467
<i>[The next target is number 2,
Lee Kwang Soo.]</i>

1461
01:27:40,914 --> 01:27:42,709
Anyways, it's me again.

1462
01:27:45,592 --> 01:27:48,530
<i>The next target is number 2,
Lee Kwang Soo.</i>

1463
01:27:48,531 --> 01:27:52,098
[I have been waiting a long time...
for this moment to arrive...]

1464
01:27:52,354 --> 01:27:54,455
The hunting finally begins.

1465
01:27:54,456 --> 01:27:58,597
The next target is... Lee Kwang Soo.

1466
01:28:00,766 --> 01:28:05,494
[The Giraffe is sure to come up
with another ploy... What will it be?]

1467
01:28:11,144 --> 01:28:13,432
Jong Kook... Jong Kook...

1468
01:28:13,908 --> 01:28:16,160
- I'm going to get Tae Hwan right now.
- What?

1469
01:28:16,161 --> 01:28:17,496
I'm going to get Tae Hwan right now.

1470
01:28:17,497 --> 01:28:20,353
- You are?
- I think I'll be fine against Tae Hwan.

1471
01:28:20,354 --> 01:28:22,508
- It doesn't matter to me...
- Jong Kook...

1472
01:28:22,773 --> 01:28:25,316
He's coming up here.
He's headed up here.

1473
01:28:29,945 --> 01:28:32,781
[Target is number 2, Kwang Soo...]

1474
01:28:35,639 --> 01:28:37,592
Why are you running away when you said
you were going to oust him?

1475
01:28:37,593 --> 01:28:40,045
How can you be running away when you
said that you're going to rip his name off?

1476
01:29:00,038 --> 01:29:04,168
[Huh? After saying that he's going to
oust Tae Hwan, he's going after Jong Kook?]

1477
01:29:05,823 --> 01:29:07,971
[Totally caught.]

1478
01:29:07,972 --> 01:29:11,182
[A born double spy.]

1479
01:29:11,183 --> 01:29:12,614
Jong Kook...

1480
01:29:13,212 --> 01:29:16,185
- I knew that I shouldn't have let you lived.
- No, Jong kook...

1481
01:29:16,186 --> 01:29:19,449
I shouldn't...
have allowed you to live.

1482
01:29:20,088 --> 01:29:22,558
I shouldn't have let you live. I...

1483
01:29:22,818 --> 01:29:25,815
Being deceived by you like this...

1484
01:29:27,491 --> 01:29:28,799
It's not like that.

1485
01:29:29,628 --> 01:29:30,622
Tae Hwan...

1486
01:29:30,623 --> 01:29:33,175
[Jong Kook and Tae Hwan can't attack
each other since neither are targets now!]

1487
01:29:33,176 --> 01:29:35,584
You really aren't right...

1488
01:29:36,012 --> 01:29:40,234
- Jong kook... I can't even move right now.
- Why? Huh?

1489
01:29:40,481 --> 01:29:42,234
I know that you can't move.

1490
01:29:42,235 --> 01:29:44,064
- Let me at least put my arms down.
- Why?

1491
01:29:44,065 --> 01:29:45,659
Jong Kook...

1492
01:29:50,147 --> 01:29:53,555
[The Giraffe's counterattack?
Is Kwang Soo really determined today?]

1493
01:29:54,963 --> 01:29:58,099
I'm sorry, Jong Kook!
I'm sorry! What I did was wrong!

1494
01:29:58,100 --> 01:30:01,344
What I did was wrong! I was wrong!
I'm really sorry, Jong Kook!

1495
01:30:02,329 --> 01:30:05,698
[Tiger with no intentions to forgive.]

1496
01:30:08,217 --> 01:30:09,425
[The Giraffe goes for another try!]

1497
01:30:09,425 --> 01:30:11,911
[Attacking with his long arm!]

1498
01:30:13,312 --> 01:30:15,235
[A real battle with no concession!]

1499
01:30:23,213 --> 01:30:24,506
What is this?

1500
01:30:26,261 --> 01:30:30,131
[The final blow].

1501
01:30:34,903 --> 01:30:39,515
<i>[Number 2, Lee Kwang So, out.

<i>Pause time... pause time...</i>

1503
01:30:42,171 --> 01:30:46,256
<i>The next target is number 1...
the next target is number 1.</i>

1504
01:30:47,205 --> 01:30:49,171
<i>The next target is number 1.</i>

1505
01:30:50,548 --> 01:30:53,933
[The next target is number 1...]

1506
01:30:53,934 --> 01:30:56,208
[Park Tae Hwan.]

1507
01:30:56,869 --> 01:31:01,592
[As soon as it's announced that he's target,
Tae Hwan attacks Mr. Capable right away!]

1508
01:31:08,520 --> 01:31:14,070
[The Marine Boy did it!]

1509
01:31:15,198 --> 01:31:17,874
What a sight seeing you like that
after playing me like a toy!

1510
01:31:17,875 --> 01:31:19,371
What did you say?

1511
01:31:20,316 --> 01:31:22,864
So this is why they're
all afraid of Jong Kook...

1512
01:31:24,735 --> 01:31:27,430
[The winning prize that
the winner Tae Hwan gets is...]

1513
01:31:27,431 --> 01:31:29,315
- That's really big.
- What is that?

1514
01:31:30,442 --> 01:31:31,542
What is it?

1515
01:31:33,191 --> 01:31:35,442
[Pocheon's specialty...]

1516
01:31:35,443 --> 01:31:41,332
[A set of ribs!]
A set of ribs! The specialty of Pocheon...

1517
01:31:41,332 --> 01:31:43,741
[Envious]
That's really delicious stuff.

1518
01:31:44,279 --> 01:31:45,705
[We sincerely thank Park Tae Hwan and
Son Yeon Jae for being with us.]

1519
01:31:45,705 --> 01:31:48,634
Anyways, today’s winner...
Park Tae Hwan!
