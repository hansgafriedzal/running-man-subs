We're in Busan!

6
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,770
It really has been a long time
since we've been to Busan.

7
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:25,540
Seeing those flowers...
does it mean that the five guests...

8
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:29,080
There are seven of us here
including Ji Hyo...

9
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:30,340
Is one of us going to be left on our own?

10
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:32,940
Maybe Ji Hyo will have one,
and the rest of us will be in pairs.

11
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:35,150
- Could it be?
- Is that how it's going to be?

12
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:38,860
[In that case,
will today be a couple race?]

13
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:43,330
Although I don't know who will be on today,
today will be another...

14
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:46,280
- Beautiful memories.
- I do have some anticipation.

15

00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:51,080
All the flowers bordering the way...

17
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:57,700
[In the midst of all their anticipation,
who will be their first guest?]

18
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:01,910
[Huh?]
It's a man.

19
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:03,160
Ji Hyo, this must make you feel good.

20
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:08,210
[Even at the briefest glance,
it's a 100% male silhouette.]

21
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:10,510

- Min Soo?

22
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:11,750
[Could it be... the hunter?]

23
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:17,320
[The founder of flower boys,
Lee Jong Won.]

24
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,800

that ignited Korea's passion for basketball.]

27
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:38,760
Ji Hyo... you can be Ji Hyo's partner
for today's couple games.

28
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:42,390
[Just like he used to act with the
lead actress of the time, Shim Eun Ha.]

29
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:45,670
[Today's with Snail-Ji Hyo?]

30
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:48,700
She's much more beautiful than when
Eun Ha used to be really popular.

31
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,500
Please don't say things like that,
it's going to go to her head.

32
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:54,080
[My little Junior is pretty...]

33
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:58,340
We will anticipate the cool pairing of
our snail and dashing Lee Jong Won.

34
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:00,170
Our next guest, please step out!

35
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:04,050
[Huh?]

36
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:08,650
No way!
[Could it be... Psy?]

37
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:14,020
- That's not Psy.
- He's a horrible dancer!

38
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:16,990
[A total chaotic dancing style.]

39
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:20,780

- Who is it?</i>

40
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:23,820
[The jolly actor, Son Byung Ho.]

41
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:30,980
[Byung Ho's joking around that makes
others cringe in embarrassment.]

Even though we're glad to
see you on here...

45
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,720
To introduce the next guest...
As for the Gangnam Style dance, this is...

46
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:54,470
[This is Son Byung Ho's style.]

00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,980
[Three flower decorated doors still remain.]

48
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:01,990
[Is it finally, Girl's Generation?]
Oh... that's more like it!

49
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,920
- That's it!
- That's it.

50
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,560
[What the heck?]

51
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:12,740
[Clumsy dancing unbefitting
of Girl's Generation.]

52
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:18,410
[This person is?]

00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,690
- Seriously...
- It's Chang Suk.

56
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:40,920
Chang Suk... this is the first time
I've seen dancing like that.

57
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:48,350
- How old are you?
- I was born in 1970.

58
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:50,270
You're four years younger than me.

59
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:52,390
[Younger by four years than
the Big-nosed brother.]

60
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,070
[The remaining two guests are?]

61
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:00,120
With each guest,
my anticipating is building.

62
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:03,880
I'm starting to build up my anticipation now.
My anticipation has changed now.

63
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:06,080
What is this music?

64
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:10,220

00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:18,810
[The confident, actor Shin Jung Geun.]

67
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:24,510
[The strength of these older brothers,
who cringes laughter with each appearance.]

68
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:30,260
- Hello!
- What brings you on here?

69
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:32,010
I just came.

70
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:36,550
Just... he just came.

71
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,110
Seriously... I have seen all of them
on TV so often.

72
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:41,470
This is awesome.

73
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:44,820
I don't know what it may be like today,
but the moment the four of you appeared

74
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:47,880
I think I'm pretty sure of the direction
that we'll be taking today.

75
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:53,290
I think I know where the writer is headed.
We really are grateful to all of you.

76
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:56,140
We really are full of anticipation
for your action today...

77
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:59,540
[Wait! There's still one more guest!]

78
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:02,670
What era is this song from?

79
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:05,130
This song is from the seventies, isn't it?

80
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:10,830
[The profoundness of next actor can be
guessed at just by the music alone.]

81
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,600
- I think I know who that may be!
- I know that vibe!

82
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:19,110
[By any chance,
is it Suk Jin and Jae Suk's Senior?]

83
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,210
I think that's our Senior!

84
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:25,950
[The legendary comedian, Im Ha Ryong!]

85
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:34,500
[This is the legendary diamond step!]

86
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,910
[The Junior's affectionate dance response.]

87
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,410
- It's good to see you.
- It's so great to see you.

88
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:43,690
[Overcoming the comedy to become
the legendary top notch actor]

89
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:47,970
- Without a doubt...
- It's our Senior, Ha Ryong.

90
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:49,230
Our brother!

91
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:51,740
[With the appearance of the big brother,
all the other brothers become calmer.]

92
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:53,760
This is really embarrassing.

93
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:56,330
[A famous phrase, 'This is embarrassing'.]

94
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:58,690
I went through a lot of trouble
to borrow this outfit.

95
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:02,910
On such a hot day like this,
all of you came out in suits.

96
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:05,940
So, you are the oldest one here, right?

97
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:09,360
- Second, third, fourth...
- He's a bit older too...

98
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,680
- And this is...
-I'm the youngest!

99
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,010
I'm the youngest!
[The youngest.]

100
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,570
[Baby Chang Suk - Born in 70.
Older brother, Jong Won- Born in 69]

101
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:21,780
At first, I used formal speech with him
thinking that he was older.

102
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:25,540
If he was born in 1970...
he is the same age with all of them.

103
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:29,440
This is... this is the first time we've been
pushed aside by a character.

104
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:33,160
<i>The doorways that they stepped out of
are decorated with flowers as you see.</i>

105
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:36,240
<i>Today is a special episode with our
flower middle age men.</i>

106
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,190
Flower middle aged men?

107
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:42,250
<i>I will announce the team's first,
and we will start the race.</i>

108
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:43,920
<i>First...</i>

109
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:48,540
- Lee Jong Won...
- Ah, Jong Won... he's the Ace.

110
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:50,720
<i>And Gary.</i>

111
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,180
- Jong Won... it's an honor!
- I'm glad to hear it.

112
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:56,380
<i>And the next one is... Ha Ha.</i>

113
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:58,560
[And the groom to be, Ha Ha.]

114
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:02,050
[The two kids excited at meeting
the CF star of back in the day.]

115
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,910
<i>Song Ji Hyo.</i>

116
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:08,570
- The snail... Ji Hyo, the snail.
- What the heck is this?

117
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:11,670
- The snail too?
- So this is one team?

118
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:15,850
- Then who's going to be Ji Chang?
- With your hair, you're Ji Chang.

119
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:19,390
[Haroro as the character, Son Ji Chang and
Snail Blank-Ji as the role of Shim Eun Ha.]

120
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:22,570
Gary has no choice to take the role
of Jang Dong Gun.

121
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:26,480
- That's how it should be.
- You're right... I see it!

122
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:29,520
- He's pretty good looking.
- Thank you, Jong Won!

123
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:35,130
- So that's 'The Last Game' Team.
- I will announce the next team.

124
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:38,550
- Im Ha Ryong...
- Ah... Ha Ryong!

125
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:41,080
All your faces look pretty disappointed.

126
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,960
- No, not at all!
- What are you talking about?

127
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:46,620
My weak joints are
driving me crazy these days!

128
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:49,090
<i>The next person is...</i>

129
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:52,010
<i>Yoo Jae Suk.</i>

130
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:53,810
[Jae Suk paying his respects to
his Senior.]

131
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:57,690
- Wow... seriously...
- I have a feeling about the next person.

132
00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:01,530
<i>Son Byung Ho.
[The next teammate is Son Byung Ho.]</i>

133
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:04,460
- Wow... Byung Ho!
- This is a good pairing.

134
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:07,490
These are the two oldest guests
we have on here today!

135
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:10,720
Then why don't we go around to all
the nice places in Busan...

136
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,260
<i>And the last member is Ji Suk Jin.</i>

137
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:15,620
[The last remaining member is,
Big-nosed brother.]

138
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:18,430
[Jae Suk to be the youngest.]

139
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:22,860
How can you stick Suk Jin in there too?

140
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:25,590
- But that's your team...
- How can this...

141
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:30,130
[The remaining Jung Geun, Chang Suk,
Jong Kook and Kwang Soo to be a team.]

142
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:33,570
<i>If you combine all four of you,
it's more than 200 years in age.</i>

143
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:36,190
How can I be the youngest one here
when I was born in 1972?

144
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,620
It's been awhile since
you've been the youngest, right?

145
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:39,400
Ah, yes...
[Jae Suk born in '72 as the youngest.]

146
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:41,710
We're the youngest team here.

147
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:45,530
- Why do you have your arms around them?
- What's wrong with it?

148
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:48,560
- It's because I like them so much!
- Stand more comfortably!

149
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,680
It's not awkward in the least with
Jong Kook's arms around us.

150
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:55,520
Seriously... I love these guys.

151
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:58,330
Chang Suk looks like the scientist in
Atom Boy with his suit on.

152
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,490
[With the suit, his face becomes that of
a familiar scientist from Atom Boy.]

153
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:09,210
<i>[Today's race is Busan Vacation
Diamond Step race.]</i>

154
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:13,400
- I think we've got an advantage here.
- The title is nice.

155
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:16,380
[A special title in
celebration of his wedding.]

156
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:18,950
I bet you'll be singing that song
quite a bit today.

157
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:21,230
<i>- Congratulations, Ha Ha.
- Congratulations.</i>

158
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:26,940
<i>I will show each team a board with all
of Busan's attractions written on it.</i>

159
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:30,990
<i>You have to toss the die and
move to wherever it points to</i>

160
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:34,670
<i>and complete the mission
and come back to the home base.</i>

161
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:39,000
<i>The chances of winning the final race goes up
tremendously for the team that returns first</i>

00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:17,550
[Fail - But a fairly high score.]

328
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:21,180
[Is it my turn now then...]

329
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,650
<i>We are Running Man.</i>

330
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:28,060
- Patbingsoo, Patbingsoo...
- Here it is. Here it is!

331
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:29,860
[Finally discovers it.]

332
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:31,210
- Patbingsoo!
- Here, this is the place.

333
00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:33,860
- This is it.
- We're here. This is the place.

334
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:39,090
[Refreshingly cool and delicious Patbingsoo.]

335
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:42,110
We have to choose it well.

336
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:45,450
[A piece of paper for them to take
under each dish.]

337
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:50,430
- Make sure to do a good job. Pick well.
- Our telepathy has to work!

338
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,600
- I think it's up there.
- I think it's up there too.

339
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,980
We have to choose well...
otherwise we'll be in trouble.

340
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:58,420
- Here it is.
- There it is!

341
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:00,750
- We found it, we found it!
- Okay, okay, okay!

342
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,550
- Let's take the middle one.
- Let's go with the middle one.

343
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:05,600
Which one should we go with,
Jong Won?

344
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:09,950
- Let's try our telepathy...
- Let's check it.

345
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:11,780
[Using the telepathy...]

346
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:16,670
Everyone... please help us send
the telepathic message to our team.

347
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:18,730
List your hands above your heads!

348
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:20,920
One, two, three!

349
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:25,340
[Receive our message!]

350
00:22:29,370 --> 00:22:32,640
[Receive our telepathy!]

351
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,610
- One, two, three... one!
- Three!

352
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:41,210
- Let's do it again. Two!
- One, two, three... two!

353
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:42,820
Okay, okay...

354
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:45,070
[Oh? Jong Won and Snail
also picks the middle one?]

355
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:49,640
[However, just because the placement is the
same, it doesn't mean it's the same card!]

356
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,730
- Enjoy it.
- It's delicious.

357
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:53,640
- Did you pick the middle one?
- Yes, we chose the middle one.

358
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:57,320
[Ha Ha and Gary also
enjoying their delicious treat.]

359
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:02,310
[Would telepathy really have worked?]

360
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:08,440
<i>You have to take the card and return
without looking at it.</i>

361
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:11,780
- Jong Won... I love you.
- Thank you.

362
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:15,020
[Still as popular as ever.]
Thank you for the meal, Mother.

363
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:18,240
- For some reason, I think we got it.
- If we get this in one try, we really are...

364
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:23,620
I don't know how long we've
been walking for.

365
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:26,290
I'm going to go crazy here.

366
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:28,960
Hello, hello... here it is!

367
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:31,110
Oh, there it is.

368
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:32,380
There it is... hang on.

369
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:35,680
[The market staple,
seeded sweet hotcakes.]

370
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:38,400
[The lure of its' sweetness and crispness.]

371
00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:44,000
- Eenie, meenie, minie-mo...
- Eenie, meenie, minie-mo...

372
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,960
Eenie, meenie, minie-mo...

373
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,930
Which one should we eat?
We have to choose one of these three...

374
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:56,890
[Each of the cards contain a
different shape.]

375
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:03,340
- The middle one... okay.
- I'll take the card.

376
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:06,030
- We have to use our telepathy.
- Let's take the one that she just made.

377
00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:09,570
[Ha Ryong and Suk Jin choose the one
that was just made.]

378
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:14,680
<i>Ha Ryong... you look so young.</i>

379
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:18,040
It's not that I'm young,
but that I'm still childish.

380
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:21,080
I'm not that old.

381
00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:24,160
Wow, this is delicious.
It's so good!

382
00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:27,820
- Wow... this looks delicious!
- It does look really good.

383
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:30,540
[Byung Ho and Jae Suk also biting
into their delicious treat.]

384
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:32,160
This is way too good.

385
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:35,220
[The heavenly taste.]

386
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:38,190
- We picked the one in the middle.
- Seriously?

387
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:42,500
You picked the middle one too?
If you did, that makes me a little nervous...

388
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:46,230
- Now, your cards...
- Please! Wait, wait, wait...

389
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:49,540
Our energy... let's gather our energy.
One, two, three.

390
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,120
One, two, three!

391
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:58,240
[Huh?]

392
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,770
[Match]

393
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:04,990
[Wow! Succeeds in just one try!]

394
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,170
[Explosion of their joy.]

395
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:12,800
- Wow, we really...
- This is a match.

396
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,820
Can I take that as a memorabilia?

397
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:18,210
I want to show it to my daughter.

398
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:24,050
[The Green Team passes their
first mission in one shot.]

399
00:25:24,050 --> 00:25:25,550
Telepathy.
One, two, three!

400
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,610
- Those guys...
- I bet they didn't get it.

401
00:25:30,610 --> 00:25:33,890
Jong Won, since you're in a good mood,
why don't you show us your move?

402
00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:36,490
Come on, show it to us.

403
00:25:37,170 --> 00:25:39,680
- Is it okay?
- Sir, can we use the chair for a moment?

404
00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:42,380
- Yes, you can use it.
- Let's see this. It's been a long time.

405
00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:44,100
Let's see this.

406
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:46,770
You guys got it in one shot?
Congratulations.

407
00:25:46,770 --> 00:25:49,050
- We got it in one try.
- Just a minute... wait...

408
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:52,910
[During that brief time,
a chair has been prepped.]

409
00:25:52,910 --> 00:25:56,900
[The commercial that's the topic
of the conversation...]

410
00:25:56,900 --> 00:26:00,920
[That main lead, Lee Jong Won.]

411
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:05,140
[The moment for the perfect reenactment.]

412
00:26:11,050 --> 00:26:13,470
[A perfect reenactment!]

413
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:17,900
[He still has it!]

414
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:23,070
- Jong Won, you were so quiet at first...
- This is fun.

415
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:27,800
- And now he's wanting to throw it himself...
- And earlier, he was screaming too!

416
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,320
He said he wasn't going to do anything,
but he's doing everything.

417
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,770
I guess his competitiveness is still alive.

418
00:26:30,770 --> 00:26:32,660
I'm going to spin the die now.

419
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:37,050
- I hope you guys get 'Back'.
- Go!

420
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,570
[Moves up one spot]
It's the amusement park.

421
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:45,350
[Byung Ho and Jae Suk making
their way back.]

422
00:26:54,490 --> 00:26:56,760
- You guys did good, did good...
- This hotcake is so good!

423
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:59,280
- Why didn't you eat it?
- We did. We had one.

424
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:02,180
We're going to finish what we
brought back.

425
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:03,290
[Byung Ho and Jae Suk bringing back
something for the Chairman too.]

426
00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:06,700
Don't look at each other's.
One, two, three!

427
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:10,240
[No match.]

428
00:27:11,390 --> 00:27:13,540
It was the middle one.
The middle one.

429
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:16,040
It's the shape of a star...

430
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:18,690
[Feeling happy just from seeing
the picture of a star.]

431
00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:22,340
- I wasn't going to take it, but it's so good!
- This is really good.

432
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:25,270
Wow... can't we just go there
just once more?

433
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:28,960
- We should pick Ddukpokki...
- Just one more round...

434
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:32,390
- That is just too good.
- Mission or not, we're just going to eat.

435
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:34,260
That is seriously way too good!

436
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:37,460
[The Green Team heads off
for the amusement park!]

437
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:38,810
Let's give ourselves a round of applause.

438
00:27:38,810 --> 00:27:41,480
- How is it we got it in one shot?
- No kidding!

439
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:43,750
- Winning really feels good.
- Jong Won...

440
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:45,600
You were really getting excited
back there.

441
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,920
[Unlike the advice given by his daughter,
Jong Won engaging in all aspects of mission.]

442
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:49,580
I kept thinking about the past with
our name being 'The Last Game'...

443
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:52,170
The other team just can't follow
us when it comes to our team spirit.

444
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:55,320
I wonder what the team that went
to the amusement park did?

445
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:57,130
I bet it has something to do
with riding the rides.

446
00:27:57,610 --> 00:28:00,690
[Bingo]

447
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:04,240
[The Red Team making their
fourth attempt.]

448
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:07,950
[About to start crying.]

449
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:18,630
[The people not on the rides
seem happy.]

450
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:28,720
[Rollercoaster of terrors.]

451
00:28:34,810 --> 00:28:36,970
[Can't do anything else other
than laugh...]

452
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:45,240
[The Red Team returning
from their fourth attempt.]

453
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,870
I have never seen such
passionate singing like that.

454
00:28:49,870 --> 00:28:51,500
Great job... you did a great job.

455
00:28:54,450 --> 00:28:56,380
Look at the thing exploding.
Confetti exploding.

456
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:03,090
[69 points.]

457
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:08,060
- You should've sang a little harder...
- You should've done better...

458
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,920
Just stop it already.

459
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,030
[Mental departure.]

460
00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:14,960
Let's get off for now,
and have them get in.

461
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:19,910
- Number one?
- Number one...

462
00:29:19,910 --> 00:29:22,690
- Hello!
- Hello... hello.

463
00:29:22,690 --> 00:29:25,630
- Here it is, here it is...
- Hello!

464
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:28,930
That looks delicious!
[Delicious looking sweet red bean porridge]

465
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:32,330
- You pick it.
- No matter what we pick...

466
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:36,270
[Eating is their higher priority
rather than the mission.]

467
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:40,910
That's good... that's really good.

468
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,580
- The blue flag... hello!
- Hello!

469
00:29:45,730 --> 00:29:48,480
Iced coffee...
pick whichever one you'd like.

470
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,950
Okay.

471
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:52,880
Go ahead. You drink it first.

472
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:57,280
- This is it... this is it.
- Are you finished eating?

473
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:59,430
- Then you can go back.
- Can I take this to the Chairman?

474
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:02,790
[Wanting to take the red bean porridge
for the Chairman...]

475
00:30:02,790 --> 00:30:05,250
- We can't take the bowl, right?
- You have to get permission.

476
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:08,630
- Can we take this to our Chairman?
- Yes, take it to him.

477
00:30:09,150 --> 00:30:13,110
- Pour it all in there.
- It's because this is so good...

478
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:15,730
- I don't want to waste it.
- It's too good to throw out.

479
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:18,950
- Thank you so much. Hope you sell a lot.
- Good luck with selling!

480
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:23,460
One, two, one, two...
[Being careful not to spill any]

481
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:27,820
[Chairman and Secretary Ji
also arrive.]

482
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:29,530
We're here too.

483
00:30:30,730 --> 00:30:33,230
Why don't you try this red bean porridge?
It's really good.

484
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:36,380
This is unbelievable.

485
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:39,970
We brought it back for
our Chairman and Secretary Ji.

486
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:42,060
This dduk is gooey like cheese.

487
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:44,040
- Here, try it.
- That's really good.

488
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:47,200
- What did you have?
- Iced coffee.

489
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,010
- Was it refreshing?
- It was good.

490
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:52,150
Shall we try it again then?
We can look at it, right?

491
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:54,370
[With the meal finished,
it's time to check the cards.]

492
00:30:54,370 --> 00:30:58,650
One, two, three!
[Match]

493
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,980
[Purple Team passes the mission.]

494
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:09,690
[The result of throwing the die is...
Jump!]

495
00:31:09,690 --> 00:31:12,560
- The sushi house. Let's go!
- Let's keep on eating!

496
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:18,120
- No way... we're headed there right now.
- No... we can't!

497
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:22,680
- Diving coaster?
- I'm getting a bad feeling about this.

498
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:31,960
[The Red Team on their
seventh attempt.]

499
00:31:34,090 --> 00:31:36,710
[They seem to be riding pretty well now?]

500
00:31:58,020 --> 00:32:00,910
[Rollercoaster plunging into a nose-dive
while they sing at the top of their lungs.]

501
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:04,720
[But still holding on tightly to their mikes.]

502
00:32:06,610 --> 00:32:09,610
[The final curve.]

503
00:32:17,150 --> 00:32:19,180
[Arrival...]

504
00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:29,090
[Singing right up to the moment
they have to get off.]

505
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,970
[Screaming right up to the end.]

506
00:32:36,970 --> 00:32:38,660
Please! Let it be this time!

507
00:32:38,670 --> 00:32:42,290
[Above 90 points.
Just what will their score be this time?]

508
00:32:45,450 --> 00:32:47,410
<i>You got above 90 points.</i>

509
00:32:49,950 --> 00:32:52,230
[Red Team succeeds with 95 points!]

510
00:32:52,230 --> 00:32:55,400
[Fierce hugging similar to an athlete
who's won a gold medal.]

511
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:59,030
<i>- 95 points! 95 points!
- We did it!</i>

512
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:04,490
Look at Go Chang Suk's face...
he's about to collapse.

513
00:33:04,490 --> 00:33:05,810
This is...

514
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:09,980
- Let's try for the sushi house.
- Yeah, let's do that.

515
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:11,900
- Yeah, let's go to the sushi house.
- be cautious how you throw it.

516
00:33:11,910 --> 00:33:14,580
If you can, try to get 'Go'.

517
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:18,180
- One, two, three!
- Sushi! Sushi!

518
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:20,460
- Go! Go!
- Jump! Jump!

519
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:22,230
It's the baseball field.

520
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:25,320
How long are they going to go
without feeding us any food?

521
00:33:26,390 --> 00:33:28,260
[Crap...]

522
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:30,420
<i>If you're hungry,
you can get something to eat on the way.</i>

523
00:33:30,430 --> 00:33:32,840
<i>It doesn't matter.
But it'll delay you.</i>

524
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:34,660
- Let's just go to the baseball field.
- Let's just go then.

525
00:33:34,670 --> 00:33:37,460
Why do I have to get insulted for
getting the 'Jump'?

526
00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:42,780
- No, you did good.
- Let's go to the baseball field!

527
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:47,560
- Baseball field!
- They sell chicken and beer at the field.

528
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:49,330
<i>Chicken and beer...</i>

529
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:52,770
I'd really like to eat something.

530
00:33:52,770 --> 00:33:54,730
Let's get a hot dog... a hot dog.

531
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,220
If we get a hot dog, the team that's
at the sushi place will soon follow...

532
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:01,920
I didn't say we should stop for ramen,
I'm saying let's get a hot dog for the road.

533
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,750
Right? We can eat on the way?

534
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:06,410
- What is this?
- Is this all they have?

535
00:34:06,410 --> 00:34:09,480
- Sausage...
- One sausage? Okay.

536
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:14,090
I want a hot dog and... an ice cream.

537
00:34:14,090 --> 00:34:15,860
Dipping dots ice cream?

538
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:18,000
- You like Dipping Dots ice cream?
- Yeah.

539
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,930
- Those are usually what kids...
- You like what little kid's like?

540
00:34:21,930 --> 00:34:25,820
- Your taste buds must be like a little kid...
- No... adults like these too, right?

541
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:28,650
- This is ice cream?
- Yeah.

542
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:30,870
A drink for everyone...
Grab a drink for each of us.

543
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:34,840
- Is it good?
- Yes, it's good.

544
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,640
Ah... I feel like I can finally live now.

545
00:34:42,070 --> 00:34:44,320
I'll open it for you.
[Double-fisting with food]

546
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:47,770
- You've got both hands full with food...
- This is so refreshing.

547
00:34:47,770 --> 00:34:49,740
You're dripping it all over your hand.

548
00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:54,210
You really are like a little kid.
Who knew you'd be so high maintenance?

549
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,950
[Green Team attempting
the amusement park challenge.]

550
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:07,510
[Nose-dive]

551
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:11,680
[Even dancing?]

552
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:18,460
[Jong Won working hard at everything.]

553
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:28,560
[Compared to the Red Team,
they're riding the coaster like pros.]

554
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:32,740
[Approaching the terrifying curve.]

555
00:35:38,850 --> 00:35:41,130
[Nose-dive!]

556
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:51,960
<i>Mommy!</i>

557
00:35:59,230 --> 00:36:02,080
<i>[Arriving at the finish line.]
Keep going! Keep going!</i>

558
00:36:03,710 --> 00:36:05,710
<i>Keep going! Keep going!</i>

559
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:09,300
[Snail and Jong Won riding the
roller coaster like couple of pros.]

560
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:22,490
- Good job... you did good.
- How many points did we get?

561
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:30,000
<i>94 points!
[Passes with 94 points!]</i>

562
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:33,340
No way!

563
00:36:33,770 --> 00:36:36,130
[Green Team succeeding in
just one try again!]

564
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:38,330
[Sweeping the missions.]

565
00:36:41,310 --> 00:36:44,470
[Jong Won throwing the die
this round too.]

566
00:36:44,470 --> 00:36:46,850
[Jump]

567
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:53,170
Jump!
[To the baseball field!]

568
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:09,010
You really eat well, don't you?

569
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:15,880
[Chang Suk finding peace in food...]

570
00:37:16,270 --> 00:37:19,850
There are napkins up front.
Your hand is covered in mustard.

571
00:37:27,610 --> 00:37:30,120
[Taking a nap?]

572
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:33,930
Are you sleeping right now, Jung Geun?

573
00:37:35,030 --> 00:37:38,060
- What are you doing right now?
- My eyes were just stinging a bit.

574
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:42,380
- We just finished our first mission...
- You can't sleep during our mission!

575
00:37:43,690 --> 00:37:46,660
- You seemed out of it just now.
- No, I'm not sleeping!

576
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:50,470
- But you looked like you were.
- My eyes were just hurting.

577
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:54,130
- Why would your eyes hurt?
- Why are your eyes hurting suddenly?

578
00:37:54,130 --> 00:37:56,800
So this is how you treat people?

579
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,580
I'm sorry.

580
00:37:58,580 --> 00:38:00,510
My daughter told me to kill you first.

581
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:03,480
- Kill him...
- She said rip your name off first.

582
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:04,930
The name tag, Jung Geun.

583
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:12,700
[After the gorging, his digestion...]

584
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:15,890
I really think
I'm going to go crazy right now.

585
00:38:15,890 --> 00:38:18,270
<i>Did you try the chive pancake?
Isn't it good?</i>

586
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:21,520
Pork soup and rice used to be
famous in the Oceanside towns.

587
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:23,470
- Pork soup rice is pretty famous.
- That stuff is delicious.

588
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:26,430
I don't think you've once thought about
or worried about our mission.

589
00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:28,910
Well, since he's the Chairman...

590
00:38:28,910 --> 00:38:32,900
- I've been part of an auction recently.
- Auction?

591
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:36,890
There was a nice house up for auction,
but I couldn't get it.

592
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:41,150
[A wide generation gap in the speech
between the older brothers.]

593
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:44,780
- Well, since it's the truth...
- Why don't we talk about the next mission?

594
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:48,650
Instead of an auction,
it'll be inherited now...

595
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,590
[Carrying on with the conversation without
a hitch no matter what the topic is.]

596
00:38:54,130 --> 00:38:55,680
What was our battle cry again?

597
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:59,760
- Live thin and long.
- Live thin and long!

598
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:02,290
We don't need a battle cry.

599
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:05,860
When you get older, shouting out
a battle cry doesn't give you strength.

600
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:07,990
Rest is what gives you strength.

601
00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:13,340
When it comes to chatting,
we can't seem to beat you...

602
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:16,380
<i>With these two legendary chatterers...</i>

603
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:22,650
Those words that are
rarely heard or used in recent times...

604
00:39:22,650 --> 00:39:28,240
Assets, Inheritance, Lien, Auction...

605
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:30,980
- Wow... seriously...
- Well, the ingredients...

606
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:32,670
That conversation is still going?

607
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:37,610
<i>That talk still wasn't over?</i>

608
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:43,000
<i>In midst of all that talking,
we're here already.</i>

609
00:39:45,110 --> 00:39:47,170
Shall we go on ahead with the
mission then?

610
00:39:50,790 --> 00:39:53,630
- Now that we're here...
- You saw, right? Our older brothers...

611
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:55,940
They don't ask things like,
'What's our next mission' or things like that.

612
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:58,650
They haven't asked anything
about our mission today.

613
00:39:58,650 --> 00:40:01,030
[The older brothers going on
as if they're out for a light walk.]

614
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:04,800
- Here's to our Driver Yoo.
- Thin and long!

615
00:40:07,330 --> 00:40:09,610
[Even the water tastes good.]

616
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:15,930
- What is this?
- What is this?

617
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:19,240
[This is the baseball field!]

618
00:40:20,810 --> 00:40:23,420
[Surprised upon seeing
the large crowd of students.]

619
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:27,290
<i>Lee Kwang Soo! Lee Kwang Soo!</i>

620
00:40:27,290 --> 00:40:29,720
[The Giraffe's ever growing popularity
with the growth of his betrayal.]

621
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:34,990
[Answering them with a dance.]

622
00:40:36,330 --> 00:40:38,550
[Star of their adoration!]

623
00:40:38,550 --> 00:40:40,100
What is this?

624
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:41,980
Are we playing baseball or something?

625
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:44,110
<i>This mission...</i>

626
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:46,090
<i>is called the terrifying alien
baseball team.</i>

627
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:51,220
<i>It's a baseball related mission in a city
where baseball is much loved.</i>

628
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:56,180
<i>A person of your choosing will hit
the ball and shout out 'Homerun.'</i>

629
00:40:56,180 --> 00:41:03,760
<i>And the remaining three needs to run
with one straddled in their arms between them</i>

630
00:41:03,770 --> 00:41:05,130
<i>while the hitter is
still shouting out Homerun.</i>

631
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:07,500
<i>So you have to shout it out
loud and long.</i>

632
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:10,530
- This isn't going to work.
- Homerun...

633
00:41:10,530 --> 00:41:12,130
We have to complete it before
he's done shouting it out.

634
00:41:12,130 --> 00:41:15,540
- How can we do it before he's done shouting?
- It has to be someone who has good stamina.

635
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:17,170
- Have you done a simulation of it?
- Of course.

636
00:41:17,170 --> 00:41:20,380
Is this Running Man or
Mission Impossible?

637
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:26,920
- One, two, three.
- I'm telling you, I'm light.

638
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:28,410
[Chang Suk to shout it out,
and the rest to round the bases.]

639
00:41:28,410 --> 00:41:31,310
- Let's go.
- Fighting!

640
00:41:31,310 --> 00:41:33,150
<i>Fighting!</i>

641
00:41:33,150 --> 00:41:34,780
Here we go!

642
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:39,110
[Oh my...]

643
00:41:41,550 --> 00:41:44,870
- That was a strike.
- Come on now.

644
00:41:44,870 --> 00:41:54,510
<i>Go Chang Suk... Go Chang Suk...</i>

645
00:41:54,510 --> 00:41:56,210
That's much more burdensome.

646
00:41:56,210 --> 00:41:57,650
Here I go again.

647
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:00,800
[Successful in hitting the ball.]

648
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:04,530
[And...]

649
00:42:04,530 --> 00:42:10,150
Homerun...

650
00:42:10,150 --> 00:42:13,420
[Quickly getting on the way right away.]

651
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:15,700
- We got the wrong mission.
- This is no joke.

652
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:17,430
You really think that this is feasible?

653
00:42:18,750 --> 00:42:22,570
You have to keep going!
[This is not Pavarotti.]

654
00:42:25,650 --> 00:42:30,440
- A little bit longer!
- Wow, Chang Suk can really hold it out.

655
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:39,820
[Fail]

656
00:42:45,090 --> 00:42:46,450
No way...

657
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:52,020
- This is...
- It's not like he's Pavarotti.

658
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:56,500
Wow...
how are we going to do this?

659
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:58,150
I'll give it a try.

660
00:42:58,150 --> 00:43:00,260
[Giraffe taking the challenge.]
Fighting!

661
00:43:00,270 --> 00:43:05,250
<i>Lee Kwang Soo, fighting!</i>

662
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:08,160
<i>[He's got momentum here.]
Here I go!</i>

663
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:18,240
[Oops!]

664
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:23,700
Homerun...

665
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:30,790
[Pretty fast speed!]

666
00:43:44,530 --> 00:43:46,960
[Fails after rounding the second base.]

667
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:54,960
[Thunderous chanting.]

668
00:43:56,600 --> 00:44:05,810
<i>Song Ji Hyo! Song Ji Hyo!
[A place filled with male students.]</i>

669
00:44:05,810 --> 00:44:10,230
[Blank Ji's absolute popularity.]

670
00:44:12,510 --> 00:44:18,620
<i>Ha Ha... Ha Ha... Ha Ha!</i>

671
00:44:18,620 --> 00:44:22,460
<i>Byul! Byul! Byul!</i>

672
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:26,000
[Not forgetting to cheer on
their new sister-in-law as well.]

673
00:44:27,570 --> 00:44:31,520
[Their sensibility is alive and kicking.]

674
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:38,650
[Battery being discharged in a flash.]

675
00:44:40,230 --> 00:44:43,350
Chang Suk, get up.
Why do you keep laying down?

676
00:44:43,350 --> 00:44:45,620
Chang Suk... we've only done it twice now.

677
00:44:48,430 --> 00:44:51,070
[Green Team taking the challenge.]
Here I go!

678
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:55,030
Let's go.

679
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:59,700
Homerun...

680
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:01,770
They're going to be finished by the time
they hit second base.

681
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:06,890
[Until this point, The Last Game Team
has been sweeping all their missions.]

682
00:45:10,390 --> 00:45:12,980
Hurry! Go quicker!

683
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:17,260
[Fail]

684
00:45:17,980 --> 00:45:20,970
[Rapid down. Small lung capacity.]

685
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:29,340
[A mouth-watering feast.]

686
00:45:30,110 --> 00:45:34,170
[A feast of fresh ocean's creatures.]

687
00:45:34,170 --> 00:45:36,010
- Please have a seat.
- Have a seat, have a seat.

688
00:45:36,010 --> 00:45:38,100
[Ultimately, eating again.]

689
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:41,280
<i>Your face has to show.</i>

690
00:45:44,790 --> 00:45:47,110
These guys don't care about
stuff like that.

691
00:45:47,110 --> 00:45:50,000
I'm telling you,
they're just here to sightsee today.

692
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:54,830
[Big brothers' world of
leisure and relaxation.]

693
00:45:54,830 --> 00:45:57,240
If we get Jump, it's 40 steps.

694
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:00,060
Jump.

695
00:46:02,030 --> 00:46:05,850
[The next location is 40 steps.]

696
00:46:05,850 --> 00:46:08,020
- We need to get it over with now.
- Let's get going.

697
00:46:08,030 --> 00:46:10,380
- Should we all say our battle cry?
- Let's say our battle cry.

698
00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:13,960
- How about we just get going quickly?
- We should say it first real quick.

699
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:16,290
- One, two, three!
- Thin...

700
00:46:16,290 --> 00:46:18,350
- You guys are...
- It's taking longer because of you. Hurry up.

701
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:22,620
- Let's just say it.
- One, two, three! Live long and thin!

702
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:26,580
After saying 'Live long and thin',
they're all moving in a very slow pace.

703
00:46:28,010 --> 00:46:30,960
Take your time. We need to learn
this level of ease from you guys.

704
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:32,510
Thank you.

705
00:46:34,780 --> 00:46:37,550
Say 'home' and 'run' separately.

706
00:46:37,550 --> 00:46:39,560
Really?

707
00:46:39,570 --> 00:46:43,210
- Home...
- And then say run...

708
00:46:43,210 --> 00:46:45,050
Okay, let's give it a try.

709
00:46:45,060 --> 00:46:47,270
- I think that may work.
- I think that's going to work.

710
00:46:47,270 --> 00:46:50,110
[Chang Suk looking confident.]

711
00:46:50,110 --> 00:46:52,810
Since he made it halfway with his one breath,
we can come the other half with his next.

712
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:56,350
- I think it's going to work...
- What?

713
00:46:56,350 --> 00:46:58,780
- Okay, okay, okay...
- Fighting!

714
00:47:00,330 --> 00:47:02,450
- Let's do this. Fighting!
- Fighting!

715
00:47:02,450 --> 00:47:04,880
[Will the Red Team succeed this time?]

716
00:47:06,180 --> 00:47:08,760
We need to get a tighter grip this time.
Have a seat.

717
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:15,490
Home...

718
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:19,990
[Quickly rounding the first base.]

719
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:24,940
He's not finished with home yet...
he's not finished saying home.

720
00:47:24,940 --> 00:47:29,530
[Pavarotti's unending 'home'.]

721
00:47:30,090 --> 00:47:33,850
Run...

722
00:47:35,780 --> 00:47:38,110
[The three men in a more urgent rush.]

723
00:47:40,350 --> 00:47:41,400
A little bit more!

724
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:45,980
We're almost done!
[Just need to get to the home plate!]

725
00:47:48,550 --> 00:47:51,320
Just a little bit longer!
[A success?]

726
00:47:54,170 --> 00:47:56,540
[Success!]

727
00:48:01,050 --> 00:48:05,040
[The moment they're given the chance to
say it in two syllables, they succeed!]

728
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:06,620
Thank you!

729
00:48:08,650 --> 00:48:10,830
Go... Go one spot.

730
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:14,430
But if we get 'Go 2',
we have to go that way.

731
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:18,840
But I'm getting really nervous about
that 40 steps over this way.

732
00:48:20,260 --> 00:48:21,550
That's good!

733
00:48:24,390 --> 00:48:25,790
Go 2.

734
00:48:28,580 --> 00:48:30,780
Why do we keep going to
all the difficult spots?

735
00:48:32,490 --> 00:48:34,390
[The Red Team headed to the 40 steps.]

736
00:48:38,060 --> 00:48:39,350
Seriously...

737
00:48:39,650 --> 00:48:42,970
Go Chang Suk and Shin Jung Geun aren't
doing a hidden camera by any chance, right?

738
00:48:43,250 --> 00:48:45,180
We're not at that level...

739
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:53,890
- With all the big brothers here.
- I'm getting suspicious of everything.

740
00:48:57,240 --> 00:49:00,320
- We're here.
- Okay... thanks for your hard work.

741
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:02,300
Everyone clap first.

742
00:49:03,210 --> 00:49:05,100
- So funny.
- This is nice.

743
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:08,490
There's quite an atmosphere about
this place.

[40 steps - Busan Jung-gu]

745

'No need for Mercy'.]

746

[Busan's tourist attraction with lingering
scents of Korean War refugees.]

747
00:49:23,310 --> 00:49:26,860
- Isn't that amazing?
- The 40 steps are very cool.

748
00:49:26,860 --> 00:49:30,740
- What is that?
- There's a certain ambiance to it.

749
00:49:30,740 --> 00:49:32,930
There's an atmosphere around here.

750
00:49:32,930 --> 00:49:36,530
The corridor and the store up here
have a certain atmosphere to them.

751
00:49:36,530 --> 00:49:39,870
That statue is so pretty.
Don't you think it kind of looks like me?

752
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:42,950
[Feels as though Ha Ryong is
sitting up there.]

753
00:49:42,950 --> 00:49:47,390
More than the mission,
we're talking about the ambiance of the place.

754
00:49:47,390 --> 00:49:49,540
- The atmosphere...
- You're not here to sightsee.

755
00:49:50,510 --> 00:49:52,350
- We should take a picture over there.
- Yeah, let's take one.

756
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:55,290
[Taking a commemorative photo.]
Live thin and long!

757
00:49:57,750 --> 00:50:00,410
- Okay, okay... did it turn out well?
- Let's see.

758
00:50:00,410 --> 00:50:02,710
- That came out well.
- It did come out well.

759
00:50:02,710 --> 00:50:05,120
Another round of applause.

760
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:06,370
[Applauding whenever there's a chance.]

761
00:50:06,370 --> 00:50:09,830
- Whenever there's a chance...
- What's our mission?

762
00:50:09,830 --> 00:50:12,030
[Finally asking about the mission.]

763

[40 steps - Shoe throwing]

764
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:17,410
[If you can kick off your shoe and have it
land on the step chosen, you succeed.]

765
00:50:17,410 --> 00:50:21,040
- You're going all the way up there?
- That's way too far!

766
00:50:21,050 --> 00:50:23,580
- How can we kick it up that far?
- We can't get it up there.

767
00:50:23,580 --> 00:50:25,750
<i>It's very easy.
People in this neighborhood enjoy it...</i>

768
00:50:26,510 --> 00:50:28,300
Ugh... seriously...

769
00:50:28,300 --> 00:50:30,560
- Oh! Here it is.
- Where? There it is.

770
00:50:30,570 --> 00:50:32,650
- Who is it?
- The Purple Team is here.

771
00:50:32,650 --> 00:50:35,140
- There's the Red Team!
- There they come.

- Where have you been?
- Where have you guys been?

774
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:44,160
Why do the two of you look
so exhausted?

775
00:50:45,310 --> 00:50:48,660
When we bought Chang Suk dipping dots
ice cream earlier, he quieted down.

776
00:50:48,670 --> 00:50:50,670
[If you want to calm him down,
dipping dots ice cream...]

777

[Flaunting his Homerun...
shouting abilities.]

778
00:50:56,650 --> 00:50:57,720
I think there's a side effect of that.

779
00:50:57,720 --> 00:50:59,580
- Has anyone succeeded yet?
- No, we haven't yet.

780

[Too bad... it goes over by two steps.]

- Wow... what a loss.
- He's good.

788
00:51:32,790 --> 00:51:34,390
You're good.

789
00:51:34,690 --> 00:51:37,190
Can you hold onto my hand?

790
00:51:38,810 --> 00:51:41,240
- You can't hold on too tight.
- Fighting!

[Oh no... a mere one step difference.]

794
00:51:56,460 --> 00:51:58,720
- Wow... just a one-step difference.
- That is really too bad.

795
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:01,670
- It's just one step.
- So this is how it's going to keep going.

[If just one more person from the Purple
Team succeeds, then they pass]

You have to aim a little higher
then you're thinking.

808

You look like you can pull it off.

809

[Purple Team succeeds!]

822
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:10,290
[The leisurely Purple Team
rapidly completes their mission.]

823
00:54:12,460 --> 00:54:14,610
I can't believe we got it done like that.

824
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:17,280
Young lady, thanks!

825
00:54:17,990 --> 00:54:20,370
[All due to the fervent cheering
from the young student?]

826
00:54:20,820 --> 00:54:23,360
- Fighting!
- Fighting!

827
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:30,890
[The Big-nosed brother
ultimately getting shunned.]

828
00:54:33,650 --> 00:54:37,670
[Grateful to all the citizens
that cheered them on.]

829
00:54:38,070 --> 00:54:39,640
Thank you!

830
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:44,030
One... two!

831
00:54:46,470 --> 00:54:47,890
- We got a 'Go'.
- Go.

832
00:54:54,580 --> 00:54:57,970
- Things are going really well.
- We're no joke right now.

833
00:54:58,370 --> 00:55:00,700
At this rate, we can win right now!

834
00:55:00,700 --> 00:55:03,640
- How can this be?
- We're in first place right now.

835
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:08,140
The young lady that cheered us on earlier...
her energy...

836
00:55:08,140 --> 00:55:10,200
[Could it be all thanks to the
energetic cheering of the young lady?]

837
00:55:11,120 --> 00:55:12,930
<i>That girls energy really was...</i>

838
00:55:15,700 --> 00:55:18,760
Okay, I'm going to go for it.
[Practicing?]

839
00:55:27,250 --> 00:55:30,040
[Taking the time out for tricks
and stunts.]

840
00:55:30,930 --> 00:55:34,160
[Seriously high maintenance...]

841
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:35,770
<i>There's Kwang Soo to help you out...</i>

842
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:38,920
Just sit still, Chang Suk.

843
00:55:41,110 --> 00:55:42,620
He can reach it.

844
00:55:42,620 --> 00:55:45,480
[Giraffe's very handy long arms.]

845
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:48,060
- His arms are so long.
- Whenever I kick, it just goes up.

846
00:55:48,060 --> 00:55:50,130
You want to give it a try?

847
00:55:50,940 --> 00:55:53,770
[Drafting the young lady from earlier.]

848
00:55:53,770 --> 00:55:57,090
- Since she has slippers on...
- Slippers would be good for this.

849
00:55:57,090 --> 00:55:58,710
What's your name?

850
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:02,080
Go Tae Hyun, fighting!

851
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:04,150
I think it'll be okay for you to
do it hard.

852
00:56:05,460 --> 00:56:08,630
- Do I just need to kick?
- Just kick and throw it.

853
00:56:09,210 --> 00:56:11,430
[Huh?]

854
00:56:15,910 --> 00:56:17,230
[Hitting the fourth floor.]

855
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:22,500
[Amazing.
Definitely overflowing with energy.]

856
00:56:25,090 --> 00:56:27,590
You did good. You're very strong.

857
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:31,960
This isn't easy.

858
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:38,770
[Fails by three steps.]

859
00:56:40,210 --> 00:56:43,310
[Jung Geun making another attempt.]
Jung Geun, fighting!

860
00:56:43,310 --> 00:56:44,700
Fighting!

861
00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:46,820
- Fighting!
- He got it.

862
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:52,540
[Kicking the shoe this time
without so much force behind it.]

863
00:56:52,540 --> 00:56:54,120
[Wow! A success!]

864
00:56:57,530 --> 00:56:59,100
You still got it!

865
00:56:59,100 --> 00:57:02,160
- How...
- He still has it!

866
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:06,180
[One of the two remaining has to succeed
in order for them to pass.]

867
00:57:07,250 --> 00:57:09,550
Chang Suk... kick it, kick it.

868
00:57:09,550 --> 00:57:11,290
It's almost there, he almost got it.

869
00:57:17,210 --> 00:57:19,940
[Kwang Soo has to make sure to
succeed in this situation.]

870
00:57:19,980 --> 00:57:25,110
<i>Lee Kwang Soo! Lee Kwang Soo!
[Cheering himself on]</i>

871
00:57:28,430 --> 00:57:30,280
[Huh?]

872
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:33,130
<i>Traitor, traitor, traitor...</i>

873
00:57:33,130 --> 00:57:36,690
[The Traitor Song is being sung loud
and clear at the top of the steps.]

874
00:57:36,690 --> 00:57:39,940
<i>Lee Kwang Soo, fighting!</i>

875
00:57:41,630 --> 00:57:45,380
Will this scene be on TV?
[Are you watching?]

876
00:57:45,380 --> 00:57:48,080
- Thank you!
- Fighting!

877
00:57:48,120 --> 00:57:50,170
[Taking the energy from the citizens.]

878
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:05,680
[Success!]

879
00:58:07,270 --> 00:58:10,210
[The Red Team succeeds!]

880
00:58:15,790 --> 00:58:17,580
It's because of me!

881
00:58:17,580 --> 00:58:21,260
- Lee Kwang Soo, fighting!
- I'll work harder to betray more from now on!

882
00:58:22,860 --> 00:58:25,370
[The young lady with overflowing bundle
of energy throwing the die for them.]

883
00:58:28,090 --> 00:58:29,600
<i>Jump!</i>

884
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:33,590
[Definitely a girl who brings luck?]

885
00:58:35,940 --> 00:58:37,390
Thank you.

886
00:58:37,390 --> 00:58:40,900
- Thank you!
- Thank you!

887
00:58:45,570 --> 00:58:47,200
What is Jae Suk and his team doing
right now?

888
00:58:47,210 --> 00:58:49,210
- Beach?
- They're at the beach.

889
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:53,980
But I think those guys are
really lucky right now.

890
00:58:53,980 --> 00:58:57,280
All they've done is throw a shoe
after having gotten to eat twice.

891
00:58:57,280 --> 00:58:59,160
And now, they're at the beach.

892
00:58:59,510 --> 00:59:01,620
I guess they've been really lucky.

893
00:59:01,620 --> 00:59:04,460
And I can't stand it when the PD smiles.

894
00:59:04,460 --> 00:59:06,570
[Hates to see the writer smiling.]

895
00:59:07,370 --> 00:59:09,480
He just keeps smiling.

896
00:59:09,890 --> 00:59:11,110
You're right.

897
00:59:11,110 --> 00:59:13,690
There's no need for a person
to be so overly bright.

898
00:59:14,230 --> 00:59:17,440
- Don't you think so?
- You're right... you're so right.

899
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:20,290
I'm not going to be so bright whenever
someone else is having a hard time from now on.

900
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:24,010
[Jung Geun taking life lessons
from the missions.]

901

[The Last Chance Team
focused on their mission.]

902
00:59:28,140 --> 00:59:30,260
We're the only team
heading toward the village.

903
00:59:30,260 --> 00:59:36,670
If we succeed at the village here...
we can go straight to home base.

904
00:59:38,020 --> 00:59:39,900
We were lucky throwing the die.

905
00:59:44,430 --> 00:59:46,570
[Green Team taking
the shortcut to the village.]

906
00:59:46,570 --> 00:59:49,200
[What mission awaits them here?]

907
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:50,800
<i>[Village - Mission impossible]</i>

908
00:59:50,810 --> 00:59:55,390
<i>[Find the hidden Running Man mission container
in the village and come to the finish location.]</i>

909
00:59:55,390 --> 00:59:59,960

you'll find the finish location written on it.</i>

910

[Head to the finish line after finding the
mission container hidden within the village.]

911
01:00:05,070 --> 01:00:08,380
<i>Be careful on your way...</i>

912
01:00:08,390 --> 01:00:11,750
[Huh? Be cautious on our way?]
There must be something along the way.

913
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:14,420
We have to be careful of our name tags...
first and foremost, be cautious of that.

914
01:00:14,420 --> 01:00:16,040
Let's go.

915
01:00:16,040 --> 01:00:18,810
Should we cover our own name tags
with our hands?

916
01:00:18,810 --> 01:00:21,150
We have to constantly watch our backs.

917
01:00:21,970 --> 01:00:24,490
Jong Won, be careful.
Be careful and watch your back.

918

[Getting the feeling that someone is
keeping their eyes on our backs...]

919

We have to find that container.

920
01:00:36,290 --> 01:00:37,670
Hello.

921
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:43,310
Have you seen someone carrying around a
thing that looks like a thermos around here?

922
01:00:44,430 --> 01:00:47,160
You don't think there's a spy
amongst us, do you?

923
01:00:48,050 --> 01:00:49,380
No way.

924
01:00:53,630 --> 01:00:55,250
[It's a water gun!]

925
01:00:55,260 --> 01:00:57,130
It's Running Man!

[The lady scurrying out carrying
a water gun.]

927
01:01:04,950 --> 01:01:07,920
[Over there too!]
Run! Run for it!

928
01:01:10,410 --> 01:01:12,460
What do we do? What do we do?

929
01:01:12,460 --> 01:01:14,810
[That's right. In this village...]

930
01:01:14,810 --> 01:01:20,360
[Everyone in this village are
water gun snipers.]

931
01:01:20,360 --> 01:01:23,130
[If your name tag is hit by the water gun,
then you're ousted!]

932
01:01:25,630 --> 01:01:30,580
[Will they be able to safely escape
this terrifying village?]

933
01:01:39,290 --> 01:01:42,280
People that cheer us on here
are actually more of a danger.

934
01:01:42,280 --> 01:01:44,080
[All the students and ladies
that cheer them on are all dangerous.]

935
01:01:50,970 --> 01:01:52,900
You don't have a water gun,
do you, Mother?

936
01:01:52,900 --> 01:01:55,630
- You don't have a water gun?
- I don't have one.

937
01:01:57,090 --> 01:01:58,630
I don't have it, I don't have it.

- Why? What is it?

940
01:02:07,340 --> 01:02:10,380
- Escape!
- Be careful!

well attacking water gun units.]

- Mother...
- Gary!

waiting to attack.</i>

Wow... they're all waiting in ambush.

01:02:50,690 --> 01:02:53,200
They're all lying in ambush,
and they're scary.

948
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:57,920
- Mother, have you seen a thermos like thing?
- Wow... you're so pretty!

949

- Mother, we have to go back to recording.

feel right now...</i>

953

into Lee Jong Won's fan meeting site.]

thanks to Jong Won's fans.]

It's all over.

- Really?
- Yes.

969

I'm going to get going, Mother.
Thank you for the water.

970
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:05,050
If other weird people show up later,
just shoot them without mercy.

971

- You don't have a bottle?
- We don't know...

975

- Huh?
- I don't know.

976
01:04:21,070 --> 01:04:23,790
Elder, have you by any chance
seen a thermos?

977
01:04:23,790 --> 01:04:25,760
- I haven't seen a thermos.
- Ah, yes.

You haven't seen one? Can I check real quick?
[A suspicious giggle?]

984
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,370
Mother, your expression
is a little suspicious.

985
01:04:56,380 --> 01:04:59,090
Seeing how nice and tidy your
house is too...

986
01:04:59,090 --> 01:05:01,030

right now.

987

- Mother...
- Let me shake your hand once.

988
01:05:03,120 --> 01:05:05,560
- Mother... you have it, right?
- I have it.

989
01:05:05,570 --> 01:05:06,740
- Where is it?
- She says she has it!

990
01:05:06,740 --> 01:05:08,150
She says she has it!

991
01:05:08,150 --> 01:05:10,770
- Where is it, Mother?
- I found the bottle!

992
01:05:10,770 --> 01:05:12,560
- This is the thermos!
- No, it's not!

993
01:05:12,560 --> 01:05:15,580
It's not this?
[It's an ingredient.]

994
01:05:16,270 --> 01:05:18,550
- Should I look for it?
- Sure, look for it.

995
01:05:18,550 --> 01:05:21,750
- Where could it be...
- Mother...

996
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:25,390
[Fount it!
Running Man mission container!]

997
01:05:25,390 --> 01:05:28,520
[Once they open that,
they can find out the finish location!]

998
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:36,300
Mother... you should've told us sooner.

999
01:05:36,300 --> 01:05:39,510
- Mother, thank you...
- Mother, thank you!

1000
01:05:39,510 --> 01:05:41,070
Always be healthy, Mother.

1001
01:05:45,140 --> 01:05:46,700
We found it.

1002
01:05:47,530 --> 01:05:51,480
[Thanking Mother for hiding it in her home.]

1003
01:05:52,460 --> 01:05:54,530
[Good job finding it.]

1004
01:05:56,270 --> 01:06:01,380
<i>Since you were able to complete the mission,
you are going to be given this.</i>

1005
01:06:01,380 --> 01:06:02,920
- What is it?
- Please take it.

1006
01:06:02,930 --> 01:06:05,530
Is it something that'll help us?

1007
01:06:07,800 --> 01:06:09,920
What is this? It's a key?

1008
01:06:11,390 --> 01:06:12,880
There's a key in there?

1009
01:06:15,380 --> 01:06:17,370
- It's a key.
- It's a key, right?

1010
01:06:17,370 --> 01:06:20,750
[A mysterious key inside the envelope.]

1011
01:06:22,120 --> 01:06:24,910
<i>You are going to definitely need that key
when you get back to your home base.</i>

1012
01:06:24,910 --> 01:06:28,280
[A key that'll be needed back at
home base.]

1013
01:06:29,990 --> 01:06:33,280
[Just what is the identity of this key?]

1014
01:06:34,350 --> 01:06:41,590
[Three keys hidden amongst
three different mission locations.]

1015
01:06:43,240 --> 01:06:49,200
[Just what will happen when they
arrive at the home base in a little bit?]

1016
01:06:52,750 --> 01:06:57,370
[This is the clean
and beautiful Song-do beach!]

1017
01:06:58,150 --> 01:06:59,810
Wow... it's so picturesque!

1018
01:06:59,810 --> 01:07:02,700
Look at the mountain in the clouds.

1019
01:07:02,700 --> 01:07:07,680
I think we can even go swimming.
[But... what is this?]

1020
01:07:08,550 --> 01:07:10,200
Please read it out loud, Ha Ryong.

1021
01:07:10,200 --> 01:07:12,040
[Song-do Beach -
Eat dried persimmons together.]

1022
01:07:12,040 --> 01:07:13,660
<i>[If you eat the hanging dried
persimmon, you pass.]</i>

1023
01:07:13,660 --> 01:07:16,140
<i>[The person who can't finish eating in
the allotted time is ousted.]</i>

1024
01:07:16,140 --> 01:07:18,070
<i>Eat dried persimmons together?</i>

1025
01:07:19,320 --> 01:07:20,980
<i>The important thing about this mission is</i>

1026
01:07:20,980 --> 01:07:26,610
<i>the person who doesn't finish eating
within allotted time is ousted right away.</i>

1027
01:07:26,610 --> 01:07:28,850
Then they can't go on to the next mission?

1028
01:07:28,850 --> 01:07:32,230
[Not able to participate in the
next mission.]

1029
01:07:32,230 --> 01:07:34,590
But it's okay if we write our own name
with a pen and still play, right?

1030
01:07:34,590 --> 01:07:36,700
Write out our own name tag...

1031
01:07:36,710 --> 01:07:40,150
- We just need to find a way.
- Ha Ryong has many different methods.

1032
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:43,000
You have no idea all the experiences
that he has.

1033
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:44,740
He doesn't care about stuff like that.

1034
01:07:44,740 --> 01:07:47,310
- What do we do with the hats?
- We have to wear them.

1035
01:07:48,100 --> 01:07:50,380
- I'm getting scared now.
- I'm starting to feel afraid.

1036
01:07:50,380 --> 01:07:52,630
- I'm nervous!
- I'm getting nervous!

1037
01:07:52,630 --> 01:07:54,370
This is really making me nervous!

1038
01:07:54,370 --> 01:07:58,300
- The allotted time is one minute.
- I don't think... one minute?

1039
01:07:58,300 --> 01:08:01,520
- One minute? Eat it all in one minute?
- Yes. Ready... set... go!

1040
01:08:01,520 --> 01:08:03,330
[Start]

1041
01:08:04,380 --> 01:08:05,610
Wait...

1042
01:08:08,220 --> 01:08:10,260
Is this even feasible?

1043
01:08:11,770 --> 01:08:13,040
I feel like this is going to fall off!

1044
01:08:14,560 --> 01:08:18,430
[Maybe, maybe not...
maybe, maybe not...]

1045
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:27,250
[Wake me up if they succeed...]

1046
01:08:27,470 --> 01:08:30,790
[At this rate,
will all four of them be ousted?]

1047
01:08:33,080 --> 01:08:35,590
[Wait! Ha Ryong!]

1048
01:08:35,590 --> 01:08:39,230
[Calmly...]

1049
01:08:43,270 --> 01:08:47,410
[Ha Ryong succeeds in
eating the dried persimmon!]

1050
01:08:47,410 --> 01:08:48,940
Who succeeded?

1051
01:08:49,750 --> 01:08:51,200
I'm the only one that succeeded.

1052
01:08:51,210 --> 01:08:55,160
[There really isn't much time left!]

1053
01:08:57,320 --> 01:09:00,560
[Jae Suk succeeds!
And then Suk Jin too!]

1054
01:09:02,620 --> 01:09:05,010
[Byung Ho's the only person left!]

1055
01:09:05,990 --> 01:09:10,310
[Not even ten seconds left on the clock!]

1056
01:09:13,450 --> 01:09:15,040
<i>Byung Ho, please!</i>

1057
01:09:15,040 --> 01:09:17,410
[Come on... please!]

1058
01:09:17,420 --> 01:09:21,930
<i>[Time over.]</i>

1059
01:09:26,370 --> 01:09:28,270
[Son Byung Ho - Out!]

1060
01:09:28,270 --> 01:09:30,920
[Purple Team's unable to
participate in further missions.]

1061
01:09:30,920 --> 01:09:36,160
Byung Ho's daughter begged him
not to get ousted early...

1062
01:09:37,340 --> 01:09:41,470
[Even though his daughter
desperately begged him not to...]

1063
01:09:42,240 --> 01:09:47,200
Ji Oh... the thing is...
sooner or later, they'll all be ousted.

1064
01:09:47,230 --> 01:09:51,050
Who are you talking to?
Your daughter?

1065
01:09:52,220 --> 01:09:55,790
Don't worry.
There's still tomorrow.

1066
01:09:55,790 --> 01:09:59,060
In war,
victory always goes back and forth.

1067
01:09:59,060 --> 01:10:00,920
That's what life is about, understand?

1068
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:05,420
You're putting your life on the line
just to eat some dried persimmon?

1069
01:10:05,420 --> 01:10:09,670
[Cool dad, Son Byung Ho...
putting his life on the line for everything.]

1070
01:10:18,010 --> 01:10:22,400
<i>This bus terminal mission is
to defend the name tag.</i>

1071
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:24,150
Huh? defend?

1072
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:29,480
<i>[For three minutes, defend your name tag by
escaping blind-folded Dong Wan in the bus.]</i>

1073
01:10:29,480 --> 01:10:32,250
Inside the bus?

1074
01:10:32,250 --> 01:10:35,970
<i>If your name tag gets ripped off
by lady PD Dong Wan...</i>

1075
01:10:35,970 --> 01:10:39,200
<i>then you'll be ousted immediately.
You can't participate in the mission further.</i>

1076
01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:40,440
- Out for good?
- Out for good.

1077
01:10:40,440 --> 01:10:42,240
Totally done for the day?

1078
01:10:42,240 --> 01:10:44,710
- You can't attack.
- But we can defend, right?

1079
01:10:44,710 --> 01:10:45,900
<i>You have to keep avoiding him.</i>

1080
01:10:45,900 --> 01:10:47,860
<i>When the three minutes pass,
a bell will sound</i>

1081
01:10:47,860 --> 01:10:50,650
<i>and you can escape through the
backdoor which we will then open.</i>

1082
01:10:50,650 --> 01:10:52,060
Then we can just go in our t-shirts?

1083
01:10:52,060 --> 01:10:54,640
I feel like I'm getting drunker with
each explanation I hear.

1084
01:10:55,340 --> 01:10:56,780
Just go in your t-shirt instead.

1085
01:10:56,780 --> 01:10:59,800
The reason being is that he can
grab onto your long sleeve.

1086
01:10:59,800 --> 01:11:01,570
- Just like this?
- Yes, that's better.

1087
01:11:02,290 --> 01:11:06,410
[Re-attaching the name tag
so it's easy to tear off.]

1088
01:11:06,410 --> 01:11:08,410
- We have to be careful.
- That's too easy to rip off.

1089
01:11:09,990 --> 01:11:12,900
[Red Team getting on the bus.]

1090
01:11:12,900 --> 01:11:18,450
[Will they be able to last the three
minutes inside this tight bus?]

1091
01:11:21,160 --> 01:11:23,400
Someone can go in here...

1092
01:11:23,400 --> 01:11:25,750
I'm going to lie down here.

1093
01:11:25,750 --> 01:11:30,900
- In case he comes over here...
- Oh, that's a good spot. That's good.

1094
01:11:33,230 --> 01:11:37,110
- That's good!
- You look rather adorable in there!

1095
01:11:37,110 --> 01:11:39,480
But you won't be able to move once
you get in there.

1096
01:11:39,480 --> 01:11:41,210
I'm going to get started!

1097
01:11:42,970 --> 01:11:46,690
[Red Team rushing to find their spots.]

1098
01:11:51,020 --> 01:11:53,400
[Start!]

1099
01:11:53,400 --> 01:11:57,850
[Defend your name tag from lady
PD Dong Wan with his eyes blind-folded!]

1100
01:12:04,700 --> 01:12:06,980
[Oh no! Heading towards Chang Suk!]

1101
01:12:10,270 --> 01:12:12,550
[Discovers Chang Suk!]

1102
01:12:17,560 --> 01:12:19,770
I can't reach his back!

1103
01:12:20,820 --> 01:12:22,140
I can't reach his back!

1104
01:12:22,150 --> 01:12:25,470
[Ultimately giving up on Chang Suk
who's sticking like a rock.]

1105
01:12:32,810 --> 01:12:35,840
[Causing disturbance by singing.]

1106

[Mr. Capable safely escaping
behind him.]

1107

[Shin Jung Geun - Out!]
[Unable to participate in the next mission.]

1110

[Oh no...]

1111
01:13:10,940 --> 01:13:13,550
[Approaching in
Jong Kook's direction this time.]

1112

[The man actively defending himself.]

1113
01:13:28,430 --> 01:13:30,270
Stop touching me.

[Giraffe using a good plan.]

1117

[Go Chang Suk,
the first to succeed in escaping!]

1124

[One unfortunate person...]

1128
01:14:38,440 --> 01:14:40,650
Why were you going around singing?

1129

Did you guys get a jump?
When did you get here?

1130

- We got a jump.
- Ah... you guys jumped.

- Can we look at it?
- No, don't look at it now.

two people will be eliminated here.

Purple Team to be eliminated.]

[The divine touch of Shin Jung Geun.]

1150
01:15:44,090 --> 01:15:47,440
[On the other hand, Green Team,
who were the first to arrive at home base.]

1151
01:15:47,440 --> 01:15:52,970
[What's the mission that awaits them
at the Maritime Museum?]

1152
01:15:52,970 --> 01:15:58,460
<i>[Find and open the hidden
treasure chest.]</i>

1153
01:15:58,460 --> 01:16:04,840
<i>[Hidden somewhere in here is a treasure
chest filled with a gift for the winning team.]</i>

1154
01:16:05,130 --> 01:16:09,580
<i>The final victor is the team that finds
that chest first and opens it.</i>

1155
01:16:10,310 --> 01:16:13,840
- You were given a key earlier...
- Yes, we have it.

1156
01:16:13,840 --> 01:16:19,520
<i>You have to attach that key under one
of your team member's name tag.</i>

1157
01:16:20,490 --> 01:16:24,100
<i>You can use the key to
open the treasure chest when you find it.</i>

1158
01:16:27,750 --> 01:16:31,700
[Green Team putting their key under
Jong Won's name tag...]

1159
01:16:34,460 --> 01:16:36,310
Could it be?

1160
01:16:36,310 --> 01:16:40,930
[Some ease when it comes to finding the
treasure chest since they're first to arrive.]

1161
01:16:48,950 --> 01:16:50,180
[Large conference room.]

1162
01:16:52,940 --> 01:16:56,370
[There's something in there!]

1163
01:16:56,370 --> 01:16:58,440
[The treasure chest!]

1164
01:16:58,440 --> 01:17:02,850
[There are two padlocks on it?]

1165
01:17:05,240 --> 01:17:07,290
[Two keys are needed!]

1166
01:17:07,290 --> 01:17:12,370
[Have to steal the key one
of the other team possesses!]

1167
01:17:21,230 --> 01:17:23,800
[All the other teams are meeting up
at the home base!]

1168
01:17:23,800 --> 01:17:26,950
<i>Is this game even going to work?
We're at a disadvantage here.</i>

1169
01:17:26,990 --> 01:17:29,640
It's more than just being at a disadvantage.

1170
01:17:29,640 --> 01:17:34,090
If our name tag gets torn off,
our key then goes to that other team.

1171
01:17:34,550 --> 01:17:38,680
- So what we should think is...
- We should just accept being eliminated.

1172
01:17:38,690 --> 01:17:41,050
Put in on my back
and I'll try to talk to them.

1173
01:17:41,050 --> 01:17:43,650
I'll try to talk to them...

1174
01:17:43,650 --> 01:17:46,620
- But this is...
- We were told to put it under, right?

1175
01:17:46,620 --> 01:17:48,890
I put in under your name tag
in the middle.

1176
01:17:52,730 --> 01:17:56,600
- Who are you calling?
- I wanted to see my granddaughter.

1177
01:17:57,310 --> 01:18:01,070
[Grandfather wanting to brag about
his granddaughter no matter where he is.]

1178
01:18:02,340 --> 01:18:05,110
Is she tap dancing right now?

1179
01:18:06,940 --> 01:18:09,150
Can't all the kids do this level
of tap dancing though?

1180
01:18:09,150 --> 01:18:11,150
- No, they can't...
- Really? Is it different?

1181
01:18:11,150 --> 01:18:14,990
Look at this.
Her steps are... they're advanced.

1182
01:18:14,990 --> 01:18:17,640
- This is...
- You have to protect the key.

1183
01:18:20,010 --> 01:18:24,120
[The two teams facing each other as soon
as the Purple Team arrives at the museum.]

1184
01:18:25,700 --> 01:18:28,640
- Why isn't anyone else here?
- Why don't you give them a hug?

1185
01:18:28,640 --> 01:18:31,410
- In the spirit of them being your Juniors...
- With trust in one another...

1186
01:18:31,410 --> 01:18:34,080
This is... this is nice.

1187
01:18:35,680 --> 01:18:40,660
[Jae Suk eliminates Green Team
Ha Ha's name tag!]

1188
01:18:40,660 --> 01:18:43,730
[Ha Ha, out. Ha Ha, out]

1189
01:18:44,640 --> 01:18:49,980
[Yoo-ruce Willis' surprise attack!]

1190
01:18:49,980 --> 01:18:52,790
- Jae Suk, that was too much.
- Get him, get him!

1191
01:18:52,790 --> 01:18:55,530
It's total chaos down there!
Chang Suk, it's total chaos.

1192
01:18:55,530 --> 01:18:57,840
It's chaos... it's chaos.

1193
01:18:57,840 --> 01:18:59,600
Don't do it! Don't do it.

1194
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:02,160
Let's just forget about Ha Ha.

1195
01:19:04,110 --> 01:19:08,020
[A guerrilla attack.
Escaping after ousting Ha Ha.]

1196
01:19:08,030 --> 01:19:11,330
Wow... Jae Suk, you...

1197
01:19:11,830 --> 01:19:13,560
- I told you earlier...
- I was totally shocked.

1198
01:19:13,560 --> 01:19:16,380
There are no eternal enemies,
or eternal allies either.

1199
01:19:16,390 --> 01:19:18,790
If we had left Ha Ha,
he definitely would've...

1200
01:19:18,790 --> 01:19:20,860
And we're too outnumbered too.

1201
01:19:21,880 --> 01:19:25,720
Jong Won... why don't we go to the area
where the treasure chest is for now?

1202
01:19:25,770 --> 01:19:28,490
We can't let it be found since it's
a secret that only we know about.

1203
01:19:30,550 --> 01:19:33,110
Should we guess who has the key?

1204
01:19:33,120 --> 01:19:36,670
- You guys definitely have a key.
- Chang Suk has the key.

1205
01:19:36,670 --> 01:19:38,240
Chang Suk has it, 100% guaranteed.
The reason being...

1206
01:19:38,240 --> 01:19:40,650
The word key is written on his face.

1207
01:19:41,880 --> 01:19:45,520
- See? No one's denying...
- I told you that it would be too obvious.

1208
01:19:45,520 --> 01:19:48,060
I told you that I'm too obvious.

1209
01:19:48,060 --> 01:19:52,680
[Bingo.
Stabbing himself in his own foot.]

1210
01:19:53,750 --> 01:19:55,610
What are you doing right now?

1211
01:19:57,010 --> 01:20:01,270
[Gullible Chang Suk...]
We were right?

1212
01:20:01,270 --> 01:20:05,210
- Chang Suk... what are you doing?
- It's true.

1213
01:20:05,980 --> 01:20:09,020
[Chang Suk has the key?]

1214
01:20:10,380 --> 01:20:13,420
[Can we switch out a player?
Switch me out...]

1215
01:20:13,490 --> 01:20:15,360
Kwang Soo, let's talk.

1216
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:17,800
[Ace Ji Hyo with her eyes on
Chang Suk.]

1217
01:20:17,800 --> 01:20:20,430
[Kwang Soo initiates an attack on Ji Hyo!]

1218
01:20:21,610 --> 01:20:25,980
[Green Team vs. Red Team face-off!]

1219
01:20:25,980 --> 01:20:28,670
[An unavoidable face-off.]

1220
01:20:32,590 --> 01:20:35,670
[Gary attacking Chang Suk,
who has the key!]

1221
01:20:36,180 --> 01:20:38,450
[It's been ripped!]

1222
01:20:39,870 --> 01:20:43,900
[Gary gains Chang Suk's key!]

1223
01:20:43,900 --> 01:20:46,680
[Go Chang Suk, out!]

1224
01:20:49,610 --> 01:20:52,580
[A battle between the two teams!]

1225
01:20:53,330 --> 01:20:55,700
[Yoo-ruce Willis seeing his opportunity!]

1226
01:20:59,720 --> 01:21:02,710
[Gary eliminates Kwang Soo's name tag!]

1227
01:21:03,400 --> 01:21:06,600
[And just then!]

1228
01:21:07,580 --> 01:21:10,530
[Jong kook eliminates Jong Won's name
tag and gains Green Team's key!]

1229
01:21:11,560 --> 01:21:14,810
[Purple Team's goal is Gary,
who has Chang Suk's key!]

1230
01:21:14,810 --> 01:21:17,630
Jae Suk!
You can't rip mine off... Jae Suk!

1231
01:21:22,990 --> 01:21:26,410
Ha Ryong!
What are you doing to me?

1232
01:21:30,160 --> 01:21:34,410
Don't tear my name tag off!
[Jae Suk succeeds in eliminating Gary!]

1233
01:21:37,120 --> 01:21:39,730
- Aren't you going to get Jong Kook?
- No... Gary, are you okay?

1234
01:21:39,730 --> 01:21:43,720
[Most chaotic battle in Running Man history!]

1235
01:21:44,380 --> 01:21:46,970
- Lee Kwang Soo, come this way.
- You're not eliminated?

1236
01:21:48,200 --> 01:21:50,410
My name hasn't been ripped off?

1237
01:21:50,410 --> 01:21:52,480
[Ace is Ace...]

1238
01:21:52,480 --> 01:21:54,230
<i>Ji Hyo really is something else...
You weren't eliminated in this chaos?</i>

1239
01:21:54,230 --> 01:21:56,340
I really thought that I was eliminated.

1240
01:21:56,340 --> 01:22:00,270
<i>Lee Kwang Soo, Lee Jong Won,
and Gary... out.</i>

1241
01:22:00,270 --> 01:22:02,610
[A pile of ousted players.]

1242
01:22:12,880 --> 01:22:14,950
Should we just go and see where it is?

1243
01:22:14,950 --> 01:22:17,230
- I don't want to.
- Why?

1244
01:22:17,230 --> 01:22:19,440
- I don't want to...
- Why? Why?

1245
01:22:19,440 --> 01:22:21,120
Why don't you want to?

1246
01:22:21,120 --> 01:22:23,370
[She knows something...]

1247
01:22:23,850 --> 01:22:28,730
- Why don't you want to?
- What?

1248
01:22:28,740 --> 01:22:31,140
- Why? I just don't want to!
- Tell me why you don't want to.

1249
01:22:31,140 --> 01:22:32,850
- Tell me why?
- I just don't want to!

1250
01:22:32,850 --> 01:22:36,500
It's weird that you don't want to.
Something isn't right here.

1251
01:22:36,500 --> 01:22:39,690
You can show me the chest,
couldn't you?

1252
01:22:39,690 --> 01:22:42,280
Jong Kook, I honestly don't know
where it is either.

1253
01:22:42,920 --> 01:22:45,470
I heard that it's around here,
but I don't know the exact location.

1254
01:22:45,480 --> 01:22:47,310
I'm being honest.

1255
01:22:47,310 --> 01:22:52,970
Before Gary could show me exactly where
it is, everyone got ousted.

1256
01:22:52,970 --> 01:22:54,770
You just know that it's around here?

1257
01:22:54,770 --> 01:22:57,150
- I just heard it's around here.
- What's your plan?

1258
01:22:57,940 --> 01:23:01,770
[Key-less Ji Hyo's plan?]

1259
01:23:01,770 --> 01:23:03,400
Do you have any hope or not?

1260
01:23:03,400 --> 01:23:06,380
I always have hope when I'm on
Running Man.

1261
01:23:06,380 --> 01:23:08,310
Do you think there's any hope
for you or not?

1262
01:23:08,710 --> 01:23:10,420
To be honest,
even though I want to work with you

1263
01:23:10,420 --> 01:23:12,910
without a doubt, you'll eliminate me
if push comes to shove.

1264
01:23:12,910 --> 01:23:15,280
[Bingo!]

1265
01:23:15,780 --> 01:23:18,100
So... are you saying that
you're going to eliminate me now?

1266
01:23:18,100 --> 01:23:21,090
I think it would break my heart
to have you do that to me.

1267
01:23:21,090 --> 01:23:23,500
I think it's right that I get you
when I have the chance right now.

1268
01:23:25,820 --> 01:23:27,650
What kind of a windfall is this?

1269
01:23:27,650 --> 01:23:31,370
Jong Kook is saying
that he'll eliminate Ji Hyo.

1270
01:23:34,520 --> 01:23:37,350
Why are you seriously being like this?
You think you can beat the two of them?

1271
01:23:37,350 --> 01:23:38,740
Yeah, I know I can.

1272
01:23:38,740 --> 01:23:41,440
[What an absurd thing to even ask...]

1273
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:45,790
[Mr. Capable planning on eliminating Ji Hyo,
then taking down the Purple Team!]

1274
01:23:45,790 --> 01:23:47,580
Don't bite me! Ji Hyo...

1275
01:23:48,290 --> 01:23:52,980
[Purple Team now knows what to do...]

1276
01:23:55,810 --> 01:23:57,790
Ji Hyo, Ji Hyo...

1277
01:23:59,830 --> 01:24:02,870
[First saving Ji Hyo from danger!]

1278
01:24:03,700 --> 01:24:05,760
We're the ones that saved you...
we saved you.

1279
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:07,670
Kim Jong Kook, you...

1280
01:24:08,630 --> 01:24:11,370
- Ji Hyo... want to end it?
- What's your plan for the day?

1281
01:24:11,380 --> 01:24:15,740
I'm going to eliminate Kim Jong Kook
and die myself!

1282
01:24:15,740 --> 01:24:17,430
[Explosive statement]

1283
01:24:17,430 --> 01:24:19,360
Ji Hyo... I won't make this long.

1284
01:24:19,370 --> 01:24:22,430
You're trying to strong arm me
like a man?

1285
01:24:22,430 --> 01:24:24,900
Would you have eliminated me if you
had to or not?

1286
01:24:24,900 --> 01:24:26,480
I would've eliminated you,
of course, I would've!

1287
01:24:26,480 --> 01:24:27,800
Why would I not have?

1288
01:24:27,800 --> 01:24:29,920
Yeah, that's a given.

1289
01:24:29,920 --> 01:24:32,690
- Anyone in that situation would do that.
- Why are you agreeing?

1290
01:24:33,700 --> 01:24:36,690
[Jong Kook standing ground on his own.]

1291
01:24:37,280 --> 01:24:40,410
[Yoo-ruce Willis avoiding with agility.]

1292
01:24:40,410 --> 01:24:43,440
You don't think I know your attack style
after doing this with you for two years?

1293
01:24:43,450 --> 01:24:45,050
[Learning Mr. Capable's attack style
after two years together.]

1294
01:24:45,050 --> 01:24:49,300
[We can see Mr. Capable's
attack style now!]

1295
01:24:49,300 --> 01:24:52,430
Even though you've always gotten me
before, it won't be like that anymore.

1296
01:24:54,140 --> 01:24:56,200
- What if Ji Hyo comes for us?
- What?

1297
01:24:56,200 --> 01:24:58,000
- What if Ji Hyo...
- Ji Hyo wouldn't do that.

1298
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,570
Ji Hyo is extremely angry
at Jong Kook right now.

1299
01:25:00,570 --> 01:25:03,100
I don't know,
a woman's heart is so fickle.

1300
01:25:03,100 --> 01:25:05,440
You have no idea when and how
it'll change.

1301
01:25:07,310 --> 01:25:09,990
What is this?
Are you going for him?

1302
01:25:10,600 --> 01:25:13,490
[Fickle Ace!]

1303
01:25:14,750 --> 01:25:18,250
[Ever-unpredictable woman's heart!]

1304
01:25:21,070 --> 01:25:23,590
See? I knew it...

1305
01:25:23,590 --> 01:25:27,320
You definitely...
you definitely know show business.

1306
01:25:28,490 --> 01:25:30,860
[Now it really is an unpredictable battle!]

1307
01:25:33,780 --> 01:25:35,180
Press down on him using your strength!

1308

[Ji Hyo takes this opportunity
to attack!]

1309
01:25:36,570 --> 01:25:38,860
Don't do that...
Ji Hyo, you shouldn't do that!

1310
01:25:38,860 --> 01:25:43,990
[In the midst of rough battle of the men,
protecting a woman is...]

1311
01:25:43,990 --> 01:25:47,220
[Song Ji Hyo, out!]

1312
01:25:47,230 --> 01:25:49,530
Ha Ryong! Ha Ryong!

[Purple Team's last chance at victory!]

1315
01:25:56,780 --> 01:26:00,010
Ha Ryong, we have to eliminate him here!
This is our only chance!

1316
01:26:04,370 --> 01:26:06,650
Ha Ryong!

1317
01:26:07,660 --> 01:26:09,840
[Docile...]
Ha Ryong!

1318
01:26:09,840 --> 01:26:11,300
How did this happen?

1319
01:26:12,170 --> 01:26:12,780
Ha Ryong...

1320
01:26:12,780 --> 01:26:16,020
I told you, that you could get hurt.

1321
01:26:16,020 --> 01:26:18,520
This good-for-nothing cheater...

1322
01:26:18,520 --> 01:26:20,280
You, go away!

1323
01:26:21,780 --> 01:26:25,100
[Jae Suk, out!]

1324
01:26:27,420 --> 01:26:29,830
- What's going on out there?
- It looks like fun out there.

1325
01:26:29,830 --> 01:26:32,080
- It sounds like they're having fun.
- Why don't we just start laughing too?

1326
01:26:40,310 --> 01:26:42,330
You're a fool!

1327
01:26:44,340 --> 01:26:47,120
- Jae Suk... it's Jae Suk.
- Jae Suk's ousted too.

1328
01:26:47,120 --> 01:26:48,830
Who eliminated you?

1329
01:26:48,830 --> 01:26:51,590
- Kim Jong Kook!
- I'm glad!

1330
01:26:53,170 --> 01:26:56,570
[A very full jail cell.]

1331
01:26:56,570 --> 01:26:59,690
Ha Ryong should have ripped off Jong Kook
when we had the chance...

1332
01:26:59,690 --> 01:27:02,040
- So you didn't get to do it...
- Kim Jong Kook just isn't normal.

1333
01:27:04,370 --> 01:27:06,470
Chang Suk must not have any strength.

1334
01:27:06,470 --> 01:27:08,340
He's only smiling with his expression.

1335
01:27:09,050 --> 01:27:12,280
- Chang Suk... can I use casual speech?
- Yes, of course.

1336
01:27:12,700 --> 01:27:14,730
Yes, please use casual speech with me.

1337
01:27:14,730 --> 01:27:17,230
The way I see it,
Suk Jin won't be able to do that.

1338
01:27:17,230 --> 01:27:19,350
He'll feel uncomfortable.
He's younger than you.

1339
01:27:20,500 --> 01:27:22,410
I wonder what makes him uncomfortable?

1340
01:27:26,660 --> 01:27:28,430
Coming... someone's coming.

1344
01:27:39,610 --> 01:27:41,440
You lost, didn't you?

1345
01:27:41,440 --> 01:27:43,750
- Did you win?
- Jong Kook...

in Busan for a family of four.

1351
01:28:08,280 --> 01:28:11,970
