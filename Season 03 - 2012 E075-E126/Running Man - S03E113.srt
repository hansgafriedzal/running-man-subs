He's the most popular.

169
00:08:50,883 --> 00:08:53,767
[Older cousin, Hae Jin receiving a more
enthusiastic welcome than the female guests.]

170
00:08:53,768 --> 00:08:55,338
The first Daughter-in-law
is very angry right now.

171
00:08:55,339 --> 00:08:59,097
She normally gets jealous over women...

172
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:01,874
It really sounds loud and noisy
even from outside.

173
00:09:04,428 --> 00:09:08,120
[Now all of Mrs. Go's family has gathered.]

174
00:09:08,121 --> 00:09:09,784
[Really look to be blood relation to Gary?]

175
00:09:09,785 --> 00:09:11,349
- They really look alike!
- They really do!

176
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:14,247
His eyes... his eyes are so slanted...

177
00:09:14,248 --> 00:09:17,696
- It's so good to see you, brother!
- Our eyes really do look alike!

178
00:09:17,731 --> 00:09:23,499
Then... with Hae Jin today and
first Daughter-in-law, Yeom Jung Ah...

179
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:26,216
and Jeon Mi Sun make up our family?

180
00:09:26,217 --> 00:09:30,882
<i>The reason why all of Mrs. Go Dong Wan's
family has gathered here today...</i>

181
00:09:30,883 --> 00:09:35,820
<i>will be revealed by legal counsel Attorney Go
from Mrs. Go's 'Go corporation'.</i>

182
00:09:35,821 --> 00:09:37,452
<i>What attorney?</i>

183
00:09:37,453 --> 00:09:40,518
[Attorney Kim Hyo Jung -
Go Corporation's legal counsel?]

184
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:44,095
- Attorney...
- Attorney...

185
00:09:44,096 --> 00:09:47,924
[The entrance of a real attorney which has
never happened in history before.]

186
00:09:47,925 --> 00:09:49,938
I will reveal to you the reason for asking
all of you to gather here today.

187
00:09:49,939 --> 00:09:51,123
<i>Sit down.</i>

188
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:54,475
- What is that now?
- There's something.

189
00:09:54,476 --> 00:09:57,204
[Mrs. Go's reading of will and testament.]

190
00:09:57,205 --> 00:09:58,663
Mom!

191
00:09:58,664 --> 00:10:00,194
No!

192
00:10:00,195 --> 00:10:01,922
[Shock?]

193
00:10:01,923 --> 00:10:06,408
What I can't get over is...
we're her kids and we didn't know?

194
00:10:07,917 --> 00:10:10,653
<i>This is a reading of her will and testament
before she passes.</i>

195
00:10:10,654 --> 00:10:13,087
- Oh, that's better!
- Doing this ahead?

196
00:10:13,088 --> 00:10:14,657
It would've been really heartbreaking
for me...

197
00:10:15,533 --> 00:10:21,199
Because she had an urgent meeting today,
I'm here for her in her place.

198
00:10:21,199 --> 00:10:23,424
Mother is still living young,
for her to be in a meeting.

199
00:10:23,424 --> 00:10:25,003
[I guess...
anything's possible with this family.]

200
00:10:25,004 --> 00:10:27,296
I will reveal her will and testament.

201
00:10:27,718 --> 00:10:30,980
<i>My beloved sons, listen carefully.</i>

202
00:10:31,439 --> 00:10:34,950
<i>Your Mother doesn't have
many days left here on earth.</i>

203
00:10:36,124 --> 00:10:41,795
<i>It seems the time has come for me to inherit
everything I've worked for down to you.</i>

204
00:10:43,335 --> 00:10:50,491
<i>As you all know, I have dedicated
my whole life into making Ddak-ji's.</i>

205
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:53,806
What did she say? Ddak-ji?

206
00:10:54,034 --> 00:11:00,309
<i>Whether it rained or snowed, all year
round, my life revolved around Ddak-ji.</i>

207
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:04,586
<i>And just in time,
through my own secrets...</i>

208
00:11:08,602 --> 00:11:13,583
[After countless number
of years and failures...]

209
00:11:13,584 --> 00:11:19,532
<i>I came up with Absolute Ddak-ji that
can't be found anywhere else in the world.</i>

210
00:11:19,533 --> 00:11:21,037
[Absolute Ddak-ji]

211
00:11:25,418 --> 00:11:28,652
<i>Pass through the various gateways today
and return to the final location</i>

212
00:11:28,653 --> 00:11:34,532
<i>and I will pass down my greatly cast fortune
to the son that wins the Absolute Ddak-ji.</i>

213
00:11:34,533 --> 00:11:36,515
What kind of a Mother is that?

214
00:11:36,516 --> 00:11:38,493
- Ddak-ji? The ones you flip over?
- Yes.

215
00:11:38,494 --> 00:11:39,728
What kind of Ddak-ji is she
talking about?

216
00:11:39,729 --> 00:11:42,083
The person who flips over the Ddak-ji...

217
00:11:42,084 --> 00:11:45,172
This is the will and testament that I've
just read to all the sons...

218
00:11:45,173 --> 00:11:50,234
Depending on the method used for it...
[Professional vernacular...]

219
00:11:50,235 --> 00:11:54,574
<i>And this will is to be followed
exactly the way it is written and stated...</i>

220
00:11:55,045 --> 00:11:56,726
Now that we're getting the legal jargon...

221
00:11:56,727 --> 00:11:59,363
[Since she really is a real Attorney...]

222
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,174
She sounds so natural and comfortable
saying all that...

223
00:12:03,175 --> 00:12:05,850
What are you saying that we're
supposed to do with the Ddak-ji?

224
00:12:05,851 --> 00:12:07,832
When it comes to Ddak-ji, it's me.

225
00:12:07,833 --> 00:12:10,379
[The first born son's provocation?]

226
00:12:10,379 --> 00:12:11,772
When it comes to Ddak-ji,
you know it's me.

227
00:12:11,773 --> 00:12:13,424
Why is it you when it comes to Ddak-ji?

228
00:12:13,425 --> 00:12:15,129
Did you not see what happened
the last time?

229
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:17,548
[The King of Ddak-ji, Jae Suk who lost without
even having to play once previously.]

230
00:12:19,611 --> 00:12:22,448
<i>- Ddak-ji...
- As it is stated in the will...</i>

231
00:12:22,449 --> 00:12:26,881
<i>the family that passes all the obstacles
and beats it at the final location</i>

232
00:12:26,882 --> 00:12:29,099
<i>will inherit the fortune.</i>

233
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:31,859
- We're playing this as a team, right?
- Yes.

234
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:37,722
<i>Here is the letter that Mrs. Go has prepared
for the representative of each family.</i>

235
00:12:37,723 --> 00:12:42,819
<i>[My beloved sons, go to the flea market in
Sin-Sul-Song and obtain a good Ddak-ji. - Mom]</i>

236
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:45,613
[Chuseok special, Ddak-ji Race - Start!]

237
00:12:45,614 --> 00:12:48,312
<i>- How do we get there? By bus?
- I think we have to take the bus.</i>

238
00:12:48,313 --> 00:12:49,717
[The rain is pouring down...]

239
00:12:49,718 --> 00:12:51,777
Wow! It's raining down so hard!

240
00:12:52,922 --> 00:12:55,728
[Following the wishes of Mrs. Go
who's lived frugally all her life...]

241
00:12:55,729 --> 00:12:59,350
[Using public transportation all day.]

242
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:03,256
[Checking the bus route to the flea market.]

243
00:13:03,257 --> 00:13:06,028
- Is that the route?
- I can't see... maybe because of my old age?

244
00:13:06,576 --> 00:13:08,898
- There it is! Right here!
- Off! There it is!

245
00:13:08,899 --> 00:13:11,126
- Number 421...
- I should've brought my glasses.

246
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:15,372
[Mi Sun surprisingly not being very good
at spotting the signs...]

247
00:13:15,373 --> 00:13:17,310
[On the other hand...]

248
00:13:17,773 --> 00:13:22,242
- Shouldn't we be running instead of walking?
- No, it's okay.

249
00:13:22,989 --> 00:13:26,452
I know this is plain to see,
but you've joined the best team.

250
00:13:26,453 --> 00:13:29,086
- Our team is most likely to win...
- Okay.

251
00:13:31,872 --> 00:13:35,665
Yoo Hae Jin and Jeon Mi Sun don't
seem to be very good at things like this.

252
00:13:35,666 --> 00:13:38,495
I get the feeling that Hae Jin won't be
very good at things like this.

253
00:13:38,496 --> 00:13:41,250
- He can't do it.
- He has no competitive streak!

254
00:13:41,251 --> 00:13:44,874
- Oh my... it's really raining down!
- Oh my goodness!

255
00:13:44,875 --> 00:13:47,272
We should be wearing rain boots like
Ji Hyo on a day like this.

256
00:13:47,856 --> 00:13:51,307
- But... it has an appeal of its own.
- I know.

257
00:13:52,613 --> 00:13:55,577
[Hae Jin leans more towards romanticism
than competitiveness as others guessed?]

258
00:13:55,578 --> 00:13:57,875
We can share a conversation...

259
00:14:00,556 --> 00:14:02,700
I don't think I'm totally getting the program.

260
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:07,144
The way I see it, you and Gary are
very similar in so many ways.

261
00:14:07,145 --> 00:14:08,934
The way neither one of you really
understand the nature of this program.

262
00:14:08,935 --> 00:14:11,728
It's been two years for me,
and I still don't really get it.

263
00:14:12,352 --> 00:14:16,079
- Just walking around is nice...
- And run when we're told to run.

264
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,331
Yes.

265
00:14:18,272 --> 00:14:20,384
I don't know if it's because it's Autumn...

266
00:14:20,385 --> 00:14:24,569
but look at all the bank on the ground.
[Bank= Gingko?]

267
00:14:34,974 --> 00:14:38,032
- There are even seats open!
- This isn't going around in a circle?

268
00:14:41,581 --> 00:14:43,028
Hello.

269
00:14:44,455 --> 00:14:47,281
There are enough seat in the back.

270
00:14:51,529 --> 00:14:53,701
[Huh?]

271
00:14:53,702 --> 00:14:58,400

their stop for the flea market.]

- Hurry up!
- What's wrong with you?

00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:21,191
- Let's hurry up!
- Let's just get going.

277
00:15:21,192 --> 00:15:24,034
Here, I'll share it. Here.

278

[Sharing the umbrella with
his wife, Mi Sun.]

279
00:15:28,765 --> 00:15:30,411
You really are a married couple.

280

[Kwang Soo and his wife walking together
under one umbrella in the rain.]

281
00:15:34,271 --> 00:15:36,055
Wait... why don't we rest here for a bit?

282
00:15:37,722 --> 00:15:38,742
Let's rest for a bit.

- Yeah?

285
00:15:44,534 --> 00:15:47,833
This is the first date you and Jong Kook
had in a while...

286
00:15:47,834 --> 00:15:49,881
Why don't you hold his hand
or something?

287
00:15:49,882 --> 00:15:52,053
- Do you want to hold hands?
- Excuse me?

288
00:15:52,054 --> 00:15:54,086
- Do you want to hold hands?
- Excuse me?

289
00:15:54,087 --> 00:15:58,167
[Holding his hand after asking
him for his opinion.]

290
00:15:58,812 --> 00:16:01,013
Of course, I do.

291
00:16:01,851 --> 00:16:05,239
[Since they're a married couple for
the day, this much is...]

292

Hey...

293
00:16:15,772 --> 00:16:17,442
- This is the place.
- Where?

294
00:16:17,443 --> 00:16:19,769
See? That's the place.
Seoul Flea Market.

295

I'm going to do this.

- Since you're getting rained on...

300
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:39,732
Since you're getting rained on,
I think I should do this.

- I think this is the place.

[Haroro feeling jealous
of Jong Kook and his wife.]

305

- You look so awkward!
- No, I'm fine!

306
00:16:53,442 --> 00:16:55,428
This is how you're supposed to do it.

307
00:16:55,429 --> 00:16:59,147
I know that you're pretending otherwise,
but I'm sure you're a little embarrassed.

308
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:02,099
Look at them taking care of one another.

309
00:17:02,843 --> 00:17:05,216

00:26:48,838 --> 00:26:51,089
Mother, we'll take this one.

491
00:26:51,090 --> 00:26:53,550
[But Kwang Soo and his family
are buying it in the meantime?]

492

493
00:26:56,804 --> 00:26:58,670
- Give it to me, give it to me!
- We're going to buy it!

494
00:26:58,671 --> 00:27:00,306
- Give it to us!
- We already bought it.

Gary and his family can't win.]

- No, we bought it!
- But it's ours!

498
00:27:08,953 --> 00:27:12,795
- What are you doing?
- Give it to us!

499
00:27:14,248 --> 00:27:16,526
- Don't be like that!
- Wait... wait!

500
00:27:16,527 --> 00:27:18,571
That tickles!

501
00:27:21,594 --> 00:27:23,347
Why did you have to say something?
You should've bought it quietly!

502

- Give us our book!</i>

[We didn't have to get caught...]

[The material they would need...]

[To beat the Absolute Ddak-ji!]

524

a material and take it with you.</i>

made of, you have to keep that in mind too.</i>

526

the Absolute Ddak-ji is still unknown...]

528

When we hit, it's got to make it flip.

529
00:29:19,942 --> 00:29:22,164
- Box would probably be best, right?
- Box?

530
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:23,931
We're going to choose the box.

- Yes, you can only make one Ddak-ji.

533

- I'm really good at making Ddak-ji.
- Will this flip others over easily?

534
00:29:36,122 --> 00:29:38,641

spot with the material you choose.</i>

I've made Ddak-ji's before...

556
00:30:54,579 --> 00:30:59,538
we should just lay down several layers of
the newspaper and...

557
00:30:59,977 --> 00:31:02,509
fold it over to make one gigantic one.

558
00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:04,897
Enough for people to wonder how
a Ddak-ji can be so big, you know?

559
00:31:08,237 --> 00:31:10,489
[Huh?]

560
00:31:14,232 --> 00:31:16,172

- Do it like this...

- You have to fold down that part there.
- No, this isn't right.

568

00:37:41,541 --> 00:37:43,754
- He really is a Giraffe!
- Look at his legs!

656
00:37:46,607 --> 00:37:47,658
He's our Giraffe!

657
00:37:47,659 --> 00:37:50,610
[Giraffe holding out by using
his long legs.]

658
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:56,994
[Could this somehow be...]

659
00:37:59,992 --> 00:38:03,262
[Oh?]

660
00:38:03,263 --> 00:38:07,001
[Being pulled by the Tiger's attack!]

661
00:38:07,691 --> 00:38:11,742
[Astonishing power!]

662
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:16,415
[Will he be able to thwart it off again
using his long legs?]

663
00:38:16,416 --> 00:38:19,199
[Not this time!]

664
00:38:20,904 --> 00:38:23,894
[This is the Tiger's power!]

665
00:38:34,058 --> 00:38:35,307
Are you okay?

666
00:38:35,308 --> 00:38:37,016
I'm so humiliated!

667
00:38:39,236 --> 00:38:41,956
[Undoubtedly, Big-nosed brother
coming to a ruin as well.]

668
00:38:41,957 --> 00:38:45,152
[Kwang Soo's team with only
Daughter-in-law Mi Sun left standing.]

669
00:38:45,153 --> 00:38:47,697
- Jeon Mi Sun, please step forward.
- How am I to do this? Seriously...

670
00:38:47,698 --> 00:38:49,869
This is an absurd match.

671
00:38:52,114 --> 00:38:56,056
Women can decide whether they're
going to win the match or not.

672
00:38:56,057 --> 00:39:00,120
- If you lose, then we win.
- Losing is wining in this case.

673
00:39:00,121 --> 00:39:01,624
[Mi Sun chooses losing the match.]

674
00:39:01,625 --> 00:39:06,371
[Kim Jong Kook vs. Jeon Mi Sun]

675
00:39:06,372 --> 00:39:09,179
The whole crowd is agitated right now.

676
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:11,339
- No way!
- They're saying that this is absurd.

677
00:39:14,932 --> 00:39:16,582
There's no way... no way.

678
00:39:17,133 --> 00:39:20,903
[In this match,
the loser is the winner.]

679
00:39:23,742 --> 00:39:25,544
Wait a minute...

680
00:39:27,743 --> 00:39:29,509
[Start!]

681
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:31,537
[Just sitting down on the spot?]

682
00:39:31,538 --> 00:39:33,630
[Huh?]

683
00:39:39,141 --> 00:39:40,932
[Completely immobile.]

684
00:39:42,592 --> 00:39:44,118
Just hurry up and sit down.

685
00:39:50,452 --> 00:39:53,797
[Tiger as immobile as a stone.]

686
00:39:59,561 --> 00:40:02,099
[Even though they're in a different situation,
both are clueless as to what to do.]

687
00:40:02,829 --> 00:40:05,892
[Only the desire to lower herself
onto the ground.]

688
00:40:06,537 --> 00:40:08,728
Sit down! Little... little bit more!

689
00:40:08,729 --> 00:40:11,272
Mi Sun, little bit... little bit more!

690
00:40:18,738 --> 00:40:20,597
I can't... I can't!

691
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:24,057
<i>- Just sit down!
- Sit down right now!</i>

692
00:40:24,058 --> 00:40:26,989
- He's way too strong!
- But we have to win this...

693
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:29,330
Of course, we have to win!

694
00:40:38,030 --> 00:40:39,773
What are you doing right now?

695
00:40:40,392 --> 00:40:41,835
What are you doing?

696
00:40:42,776 --> 00:40:45,085
[Outburst of criticism.]

697
00:40:47,831 --> 00:40:49,776
- I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
- What are you doing?

698
00:40:50,510 --> 00:40:53,717
[Tiger sprawling out on the ground.]

699
00:40:54,687 --> 00:40:57,686
[Jong Kook wins!]

700
00:40:58,450 --> 00:41:00,947
<i>Mi Sun, you could've just sat down!</i>

701
00:41:00,948 --> 00:41:03,764
What are you doing right now?
Are you playing around with her?

702
00:41:03,765 --> 00:41:06,044
What are you taking her for?

703
00:41:09,992 --> 00:41:12,730
The Red Team moves on to the final round!

704
00:41:12,731 --> 00:41:14,066
[Red Team moves up to the final round.]

705
00:41:17,628 --> 00:41:20,266
[Final round
Gary's Team vs. Jong Kook's Team]

706
00:41:20,929 --> 00:41:25,502
[Song Ji Hyo vs. Yeom Jung Ah]

707
00:41:25,537 --> 00:41:26,706
Sit down.

708
00:41:26,707 --> 00:41:30,360
[Charismatic first Daughter-in-law, Jung Ah]

709
00:41:32,372 --> 00:41:34,266
[Ji Hyo vs. Jung Ah.
Wrestling for the win.]

710
00:41:34,267 --> 00:41:35,750
She's really strong!

711
00:41:35,751 --> 00:41:37,234
A round of applause for our two ladies!

712
00:41:37,235 --> 00:41:39,116
[Our team is the winning team.]

713
00:41:40,192 --> 00:41:41,629
What do I do?

714
00:41:43,041 --> 00:41:47,871
[Women's match with no conceding.]

715
00:41:49,091 --> 00:41:51,097
[Start!]

716
00:41:56,751 --> 00:41:59,030
Oh my goodness...
she's not even budging.

717
00:42:00,852 --> 00:42:03,095
[This is the power of our
Running Man's Ace.]

718
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:07,947
Ji Hyo, Ji Hyo...
[This is no joke.]

719
00:42:08,839 --> 00:42:12,020
[Jung Ah's attack!]

720
00:42:12,021 --> 00:42:14,653
[Will she?]

721
00:42:15,646 --> 00:42:18,353
[The attack just ends with a
hint of danger.]

722
00:42:18,354 --> 00:42:20,660
- You have to be careful now...
- Those girls...

723
00:42:20,661 --> 00:42:23,828
[This time, Ji Hyo is...]

724
00:42:23,829 --> 00:42:28,031
[Catching the outer leg perfectly!]

725
00:42:31,477 --> 00:42:34,298
[Ji Hyo's single victory!]

726
00:42:38,514 --> 00:42:40,953
[Lightning fast skills!]

727
00:42:43,148 --> 00:42:45,502
Ji Hyo!
You got her outer leg perfectly!

728
00:42:48,734 --> 00:42:50,683
It could happen... it could happen.

729
00:42:52,113 --> 00:42:53,921
You can finish this up for us.

730
00:42:58,403 --> 00:43:00,529
[Her next opponent, nervous Ha Ha.]

731
00:43:00,530 --> 00:43:02,411
I feel like I'm going to lose this
even if I really give it my best try.

732
00:43:02,412 --> 00:43:05,295
You saw what she did earlier, didn't you?
She knows what to do with her legs!

733
00:43:05,296 --> 00:43:08,439
- Ji Hyo, just beat him.
- I don't know, Suk Jin.

734
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:12,504
[Ji Hyo vs. Ha Ha]

735
00:43:14,775 --> 00:43:18,606
[Going with the option to lose the match
this time around.]

736
00:43:23,775 --> 00:43:24,957
[Start!]

737
00:43:24,958 --> 00:43:26,766
[Huh?]

738
00:43:30,771 --> 00:43:33,345
[Sprawling down at a lightning fast speed!]

739
00:43:40,001 --> 00:43:43,640
[Ha Ha not even having the chance
to use any of his strength.]

740
00:43:44,745 --> 00:43:47,597
[Wow! What a sight to see!]

741
00:43:50,733 --> 00:43:52,639
Ji Hyo... that was perfect!

742
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:54,726
[Jae Suk filled with admiration.]

743
00:43:54,727 --> 00:43:56,078
That was the perfect move!

744
00:43:56,079 --> 00:43:59,091
[Admiration plus laughter.]

745
00:44:02,249 --> 00:44:03,533
Jae Suk...

746
00:44:05,244 --> 00:44:07,212
When someone pulls that move,
they usually end up dangling in the air.

747
00:44:07,569 --> 00:44:09,442
But her butt totally just touched the ground.

748
00:44:10,252 --> 00:44:12,749
- Why do you think that is?
- He's trying to attack you with his words.

749
00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:16,160
Most women's butts wouldn't touch
the ground like that.

750
00:44:16,161 --> 00:44:19,401
[She's good at kicking too!]

751
00:44:19,402 --> 00:44:21,625
There are a lot of people here, Ji Hyo.

752
00:44:23,517 --> 00:44:27,879
[If Blank Ji beats the Tiger,
the game is immediately over!]

753
00:44:29,447 --> 00:44:32,133
[But her opponent is
an all-round player, Mr. Capable.]

754
00:44:32,134 --> 00:44:34,861
[Song Ji Hyo vs. Kim Jong Kook]

755
00:44:34,862 --> 00:44:37,822
But her plan is known now...

756
00:44:39,199 --> 00:44:40,976
<i>She should've used that move
on Jong Kook.</i>

757
00:44:40,977 --> 00:44:43,820
[Opting for the losing match this time again.]

758
00:44:43,821 --> 00:44:45,488
<i>What is she doing right now?</i>

759
00:44:49,801 --> 00:44:54,897
Everyone... both teams,
let's give them a round of cheer!

760
00:44:54,898 --> 00:44:58,085
[The final round
overflowing with apprehension.]

761
00:45:00,271 --> 00:45:04,287
[Will she be able to beat Mr. Capable...]

762
00:45:04,288 --> 00:45:08,955
[and win with a three win streak?]

763
00:45:11,410 --> 00:45:13,021
[Start!]

764
00:45:14,711 --> 00:45:18,676
[Going to for sprawl out
on the ground move again!]

765
00:45:26,724 --> 00:45:28,755
[And lifting her right off the ground.]

766
00:45:36,104 --> 00:45:39,303
[A move that won't fly with
Mr. Capable.]

767
00:45:39,304 --> 00:45:41,948
I don't feel really good about easily
holding her off the ground right now.

768
00:45:43,044 --> 00:45:44,079
Hey!

769
00:45:45,674 --> 00:45:47,597
Hey! Don't do that!

770
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:51,671
Should I end this quickly?

771
00:45:51,672 --> 00:45:52,973
Hey!

772
00:45:54,259 --> 00:45:56,606
[Blank Ji's strong resistance!]

773
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:02,660
[Jong Kook wins!]

774
00:46:02,661 --> 00:46:03,829
Ji Hyo, you did good.

775
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:07,191
[Blank Ji having beat two people.]

776
00:46:07,192 --> 00:46:09,458
<i>She really is very strong.</i>

777
00:46:10,729 --> 00:46:12,829
Jong Kook, how are you going to beat
all three people?

778
00:46:12,830 --> 00:46:14,786
She seriously is very strong.

779
00:46:15,484 --> 00:46:17,003
I'll go this time.

780
00:46:17,004 --> 00:46:19,886
[Jae Suk finally makes his entrance.]

781
00:46:20,771 --> 00:46:24,934
[Yoo Jae Suk vs. Kim Jong Kook]

782
00:46:25,949 --> 00:46:29,137
[All throughout the history of the show,
they've been lifelong rivals.]

783
00:46:29,138 --> 00:46:34,200
[The humiliation from
Chuseok special a year ago.]

784
00:46:34,201 --> 00:46:37,658
[Having lost without even having been
able to exert his strength once.]

785
00:46:37,659 --> 00:46:40,800
[That shameful match...]

786
00:46:40,801 --> 00:46:42,185
<i>Jong Kook's the winner!</i>

787
00:46:42,917 --> 00:46:46,647
[Will he be able to pay him back
for that shame today?]

788
00:46:46,648 --> 00:46:48,773
- Isn't this going too fast without break?
- We have to do this quickly!

789
00:46:50,744 --> 00:46:52,994
[Huh?]

790
00:46:53,314 --> 00:46:56,384
[Rubbing his body up against
him all of a sudden?]

791
00:46:56,385 --> 00:46:57,770
What are you doing right now?

792
00:46:57,771 --> 00:46:59,904
- What are you doing?
- I'm trying to grab onto the straps!

793
00:47:03,985 --> 00:47:06,150
- What...
- I'm trying to grab onto the straps!

794
00:47:06,151 --> 00:47:07,734
You are the weirdest man!

795
00:47:14,062 --> 00:47:17,552
[Even if he can't win the match,
doing what he can to exert the Tiger.]

796
00:47:17,553 --> 00:47:20,201
[Mr. Capability's power that can be felt.]

797
00:47:27,696 --> 00:47:29,266
[Start!]

798
00:47:36,681 --> 00:47:39,563
[The history of shame that's being
repeated again this year.]

799
00:47:39,564 --> 00:47:41,594
Throw him!

800
00:47:44,491 --> 00:47:46,465
One more time...
let's do it one more time.

801
00:47:46,466 --> 00:47:48,437
Set... go!

802
00:47:49,852 --> 00:47:52,180
[Defense in depth.]

803
00:47:54,251 --> 00:47:56,496
[Immediate apology.]

804
00:48:02,638 --> 00:48:05,464
[Right back in the air again...]

805
00:48:08,898 --> 00:48:11,511
[Time?]

806
00:48:11,512 --> 00:48:14,206
- Why? What do you need the time for?
- My straps are too tight.

807
00:48:14,207 --> 00:48:17,085
- Just a little bit...
- Okay, I got it.

808
00:48:17,086 --> 00:48:20,562
Loosen it up a little bit.
It's really pinching my skin.

809
00:48:20,563 --> 00:48:21,692
Grab it right here.

810
00:48:21,692 --> 00:48:25,393
[Just then!]

811
00:48:25,394 --> 00:48:28,794
[Using the moment
his defenses are down to attack!]

812
00:48:29,482 --> 00:48:35,368
[Will his plan actually work?]

813
00:48:39,136 --> 00:48:41,355
[Huh?]

814
00:48:42,198 --> 00:48:45,087
[The handiwork?]

815
00:48:51,706 --> 00:48:53,609
No, no...

816
00:48:58,010 --> 00:49:00,490
- What are you doing?
- It's because of these straps... the straps.

817
00:49:06,110 --> 00:49:08,797
[Using every ounce of strength he has
until the very end...]

818
00:49:08,797 --> 00:49:11,027
[The Tiger made of stone
isn't budging an inch.]

819
00:49:11,028 --> 00:49:13,832
- What?
- Jae Suk, that's too ugly of a sight!

820
00:49:15,174 --> 00:49:17,189
Do you really want me to flip you over?

821
00:49:17,190 --> 00:49:20,366
[Flip... flip him over?]

822
00:49:22,553 --> 00:49:28,907
[No way...]

823
00:49:31,146 --> 00:49:33,639
[Gulp...]

824
00:49:34,595 --> 00:49:37,461
[Jae Suk flipped over...]

825
00:49:43,985 --> 00:49:45,663

[Even if we failed,
we should eat what we can.]

954

- Tastes so much better to eat like this.
- This is really good.

955

If I had only put
this much effort into acting...

I'm sorry,
but I think you need to get her some.

958

She's pretty on edge right now.

959
00:59:14,119 --> 00:59:15,452
We're going to have a drink of soju here.

960

[Without an issue even if her arm
is tied up with the tube?]

962

01:01:27,818 --> 01:01:29,730
[That's so hot!]

994
01:01:30,753 --> 01:01:32,846
You have to eat this
while scalding the roof of your mouth.

995
01:01:33,866 --> 01:01:37,066
The unfair thing about this game is
that it's all about using your strength.

996
01:01:37,067 --> 01:01:38,667
It's not really like that, Hae Jin.

997
01:01:38,668 --> 01:01:42,986
- If you had gone to the other place..
- That would have been even worse.

998
01:01:42,987 --> 01:01:46,267
<i>The other team has to sit there
without swallowing anything.</i>

999
01:01:46,268 --> 01:01:49,171
Seriously? At least we get to eat!

1000
01:01:49,172 --> 01:01:52,627
[At least these two teams get to eat meat...]

1001
01:01:53,166 --> 01:01:56,270
[Kwang Soo's Team...]

1002
01:02:00,184 --> 01:02:06,048
[Succeed the mission if they don't swallow
any spit until the meat's done cooking.]

1003
01:02:06,049 --> 01:02:08,600
- Miss Mi Sun, I think you swallowed.
- No, no... no, I didn't.

1004
01:02:08,601 --> 01:02:10,129
That's just her habit.

1005
01:02:23,463 --> 01:02:24,586
Don't flip it over, please don't do it.

1006
01:02:24,587 --> 01:02:27,826
[Danger! The meat is being flipped over!]

1007
01:02:32,958 --> 01:02:34,971
I'm about to go crazy. Don't flip it over.

1008
01:02:34,972 --> 01:02:38,175
[The moment that the
ultimate top sirloin gets flipped over!]

1009
01:02:38,176 --> 01:02:41,497
[Stimulating the appetite 10,000%]

1010
01:02:47,372 --> 01:02:53,597
[Fanning the scent of grilling meat their way
to make them lose their composure.]

1011
01:02:58,327 --> 01:03:02,099
[I won't forgive you for this...]

1012
01:03:07,207 --> 01:03:08,772
Would you like to smell it?

1013
01:03:23,261 --> 01:03:25,650
[Giraffe swallowing way too noticeably!]

1014
01:03:25,651 --> 01:03:27,497
You've failed.

1015
01:03:28,704 --> 01:03:31,282
[No excuses can be accepted
for the way he was caught.]

1016
01:03:32,204 --> 01:03:36,103
[The grilled meat goes to
the VJ's and the staff.]

1017
01:03:37,324 --> 01:03:41,064
[Giving a bite to Big brother's VJ,
Yoo Suk.]

1018
01:03:45,420 --> 01:03:47,130
[Awesome!]

1019
01:03:48,489 --> 01:03:53,638
[Since it was a big piece of meat,
everyone gets to have a bite.]

1020
01:03:54,224 --> 01:03:55,644
Is it good? How is it?

1021
01:03:56,977 --> 01:03:59,609
[And of course, a bite for PD Myuk.]

1022
01:03:59,610 --> 01:04:01,333
Don't eat that in front of us!

1023
01:04:01,334 --> 01:04:03,494
Hey, why did you swallow?

1024
01:04:03,495 --> 01:04:05,899
Ddak-ji... think of Ddak-ji!

1025
01:04:05,900 --> 01:04:08,743
[So... hungry...]

1026
01:04:11,308 --> 01:04:12,926
<i>Ji Hyo... </i>

1027
01:04:12,927 --> 01:04:15,990
- Ji Hyo...
- There's no way that they can do this.

1028
01:04:16,618 --> 01:04:18,460
[Concentrating all their might
on their chopsticks.]

1029
01:04:18,461 --> 01:04:19,868
<i>Just look at Ji Hyo...</i>

1030
01:04:21,922 --> 01:04:25,012
[Angry Ace for not having things
go the way she wants when she's hungry.]

1031
01:04:28,759 --> 01:04:32,020
[Hae Jin losing all the strength he has left.]

1032
01:04:32,021 --> 01:04:33,335
[Huh? Ah...]

1033
01:04:34,017 --> 01:04:36,232
[Hae Jin doesn't even know...]

1034
01:04:41,192 --> 01:04:43,006
[Where do you think you're going?]

1035
01:04:44,185 --> 01:04:47,595
[Grabbing a piece with
his whole body quivering.]

1036
01:04:50,227 --> 01:04:52,364
[Not much time left on the clock]

1037
01:04:53,772 --> 01:04:56,312
- Hae Jin, are you eating?
- I'm totally zapped of strength.

1038
01:04:56,313 --> 01:04:58,637
Wait... what are you doing?

1039
01:05:01,698 --> 01:05:03,422
- Variety!
- Variety!

1040
01:05:03,423 --> 01:05:05,649
Variety mentality!

1041
01:05:05,650 --> 01:05:07,641
What is this with the hands?

1042
01:05:07,642 --> 01:05:10,771
[Anyways, failing again with
Jong Kook's playing around.]

1043
01:05:12,592 --> 01:05:14,328
Here, eat... eat.

1044
01:05:14,329 --> 01:05:15,760
Here, eat all of it.

1045
01:05:16,788 --> 01:05:21,792
[Jung Ah grilling meat for the opposing
team since they lost their mission.]

1046
01:05:21,793 --> 01:05:25,737
[Taking the pose of the head Daughter-in-law
during the holidays.]

1047
01:05:26,922 --> 01:05:29,296
Hae Jin looks like he's settled in his seat.

1048
01:05:29,297 --> 01:05:31,396
<i>A bottle of soju over here, please!</i>

1049
01:05:33,234 --> 01:05:35,207
Why don't you get up now?

1050
01:05:35,208 --> 01:05:37,385
Our program really does
make you hungry, doesn't it?

1051
01:05:41,798 --> 01:05:44,286
I think Hae Jin is finally done eating.

1052
01:05:44,287 --> 01:05:46,079
Thank you... thank you.

1053
01:05:48,896 --> 01:05:50,876
This really was an
entertaining drinking table tonight.

1054
01:05:56,338 --> 01:05:57,961
- What?
- Housewarming party? Housewarming party?

1055
01:05:58,788 --> 01:06:01,544
[Monday couple's housewarming party?]

1056
01:06:01,545 --> 01:06:03,039
<i>I think they must run a restaurant.</i>

1057
01:06:03,040 --> 01:06:05,882
You should have put out some more food.
I told you that we were having guests.

1058
01:06:05,883 --> 01:06:08,413
This is barely enough to cover anyone's
nose with what we have here.

1059
01:06:08,894 --> 01:06:10,960
I put it up your nose earlier.

1060
01:06:13,190 --> 01:06:14,945
[Start]

1061
01:06:23,990 --> 01:06:25,813
Jong Kook, one at a time!

1062
01:06:27,508 --> 01:06:28,875
Give me some too, Jong Kook.

1063
01:06:31,432 --> 01:06:33,425
[Almost done eating...]

1064
01:06:33,426 --> 01:06:35,205
Let's go!

1065
01:06:37,344 --> 01:06:40,685
Hurry up and set it down! Hurry!

1066
01:06:46,477 --> 01:06:48,412
[The last piece!]

1067
01:06:55,189 --> 01:06:59,284
[He ate it, but the time...]

1068
01:07:00,223 --> 01:07:04,683
[Jong Kook's Team succeeds at
29.82 seconds!]

1069
01:07:04,684 --> 01:07:08,481
[Mr. Capability's tenacity
has paid off in this round!]

1070
01:07:11,295 --> 01:07:14,541
[First team to pass the mission
out of all three teams.]

1071
01:07:14,834 --> 01:07:17,476
The one I used is probably
a bit stretched out, so use that one.

1072
01:07:18,690 --> 01:07:21,281
[The rubber tube seemed to be stretched out
after having him use his strength against it.]

1073
01:07:21,282 --> 01:07:23,391
We have to keep doing this until we pass.

1074
01:07:26,315 --> 01:07:28,114
<i>Set... go!</i>

1075
01:07:30,590 --> 01:07:33,273
[All the chopsticks easily going in
for grabs.]

1076
01:07:33,980 --> 01:07:37,315
[After a few uses,
the rubber seemed to have stretched.]

1077
01:07:37,316 --> 01:07:39,875
I don't want it to be too difficult
for them to eat it.

1078
01:07:40,481 --> 01:07:43,969
[The meat disappearing the moment
he lays them on the grill.]

1079
01:07:46,628 --> 01:07:48,061
I'm so hungry!

1080
01:07:52,263 --> 01:07:54,252
- What the heck?
- They're doing really good.

1081
01:07:58,978 --> 01:08:02,388
[Gary's Team succeeds with ease.]

1082
01:08:04,927 --> 01:08:07,695
[Hae Jin always making sure to eat
all the side dishes.]

1083
01:08:08,882 --> 01:08:11,588
[Mm... so good...]

1084
01:08:12,104 --> 01:08:14,274
<i>Jae Suk, the place we have to go...</i>

1085
01:08:15,033 --> 01:08:20,315
<i>[You still have one more chance.
Hurry on to the pancake shop.]</i>

1086
01:08:20,316 --> 01:08:22,326
- Myoungrhyun intersection?
- Myoungrhyun intersection.

1087
01:08:22,327 --> 01:08:24,932
Then that would be in front of
Song Ryun University.

1088
01:08:24,933 --> 01:08:27,677
[It's not very far from here...]

1089
01:08:27,678 --> 01:08:29,834
Then let's take a taxi over there.

1090
01:08:29,835 --> 01:08:33,745
[Gary's team dividing up into
two taxis to move to their next stop.]

1091
01:08:33,746 --> 01:08:36,280
[Ji Hyo and Hae Jin getting in the cab first.]

1092
01:08:37,789 --> 01:08:39,702
- Let's move quickly!
- Thank you!

1093
01:08:41,243 --> 01:08:42,440
Thank you, sir.

1094
01:08:44,731 --> 01:08:46,316
I ate so well.

1095
01:08:47,684 --> 01:08:50,027
<i>You look like a foreigner.</i>

1096
01:08:50,540 --> 01:08:52,641
- Excuse me?
- You look like a foreigner.

1097
01:08:52,642 --> 01:08:54,872
- Are you referring to me?
- No, the lady.

1098
01:08:54,873 --> 01:08:56,493
<i>You look totally native though.</i>

1099
01:08:59,483 --> 01:09:03,580
[Jong Kook's Team being directed on
which way to go at the police station.]

1100
01:09:04,588 --> 01:09:05,936
Thank you so much.

1101
01:09:05,937 --> 01:09:08,377
[Fully comprehending which routes to take
and where they need to go.]

1102
01:09:08,378 --> 01:09:10,250
- Thank you so much.
- Have a great night. Thank you.

1103
01:09:12,006 --> 01:09:14,727
<i>Bus route number eight.
This one here.</i>

1104
01:09:16,018 --> 01:09:17,477
<i>Three people.</i>

1105
01:09:17,478 --> 01:09:19,177
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1106
01:09:20,589 --> 01:09:23,041
<i>Do you know this area very well?
[Kwang Soo's team on the other hand...]</i>

1107
01:09:23,590 --> 01:09:26,537
Do you know this area well?
Around here?

1108
01:09:26,538 --> 01:09:28,204
[After barely having passed the mission,
heading off to the pancake shop.]

1109
01:09:28,205 --> 01:09:31,309
<i>We have to right now...
let's see here...</i>

1110
01:09:31,310 --> 01:09:34,488
[Asking direction to the location while
looking at the map to the destination.]

1111
01:09:34,489 --> 01:09:37,323
- Then you need to get off right here.
- Get off at this stop?

1112
01:09:37,324 --> 01:09:41,763
[Kindly and patiently
explaining it all to them.]

1113
01:09:41,764 --> 01:09:43,987
Thank you... thank you so much.

1114
01:09:43,988 --> 01:09:46,323
- It's where a lot of young kids go.
- Ah, young kids?

1115
01:09:46,324 --> 01:09:47,983
Then you and Mi Sun shouldn't go.

1116
01:09:51,179 --> 01:09:52,389
I'm sorry.

1117
01:09:55,863 --> 01:09:56,998
<i>Thank you!</i>

1118
01:09:56,998 --> 01:10:00,727
[Each arriving at the location.]

1119
01:10:04,307 --> 01:10:07,919
[Locating the pancake house
at the Myungryun intersection.]

1120
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:10,338
This way... here it is. Here.

1121
01:10:11,038 --> 01:10:13,911
- We fit very well...
- We fit and work very well together.

1122
01:10:13,912 --> 01:10:16,566
[Jong Kook and Ha Ha head over heels
for Jung Ah's motherly image?]

1123
01:10:16,567 --> 01:10:19,614
- But I think I'm really bad at the games.
- But that's not what's most important.

1124
01:10:21,006 --> 01:10:24,150
- But you really are horrible.
- Fine! I'm horrible at it!

1125
01:10:26,887 --> 01:10:30,016
[Finally arriving at the pancake house.]

1126
01:10:30,017 --> 01:10:34,213
[Just what Ddak-ji related mission
awaits for them here?]

1127
01:10:37,999 --> 01:10:41,202
[To Jong Kook's team that won
first place at the restaurant earlier...]

1128
01:10:41,203 --> 01:10:46,844
[Is given the first chance to swap
their Ddak-ji with an opposing team.]

1129
01:10:46,845 --> 01:10:50,247
[Not allowed to re-trade the Ddak-ji
they've already traded for.]

1130
01:10:50,248 --> 01:10:51,833
I see how it is...

1131
01:10:51,834 --> 01:10:54,123
We remember exactly what we all have.

1132
01:10:54,124 --> 01:10:56,420
- There is one that we'd like to have.
- Yes, there is one.

1133
01:10:56,421 --> 01:11:00,977
<i>Since you've won first place,
you can either hold onto one you have...</i>

1134
01:11:00,978 --> 01:11:02,810
<i>or you can trade it with another team.</i>

1135
01:11:02,811 --> 01:11:05,978
If they lock one of theirs down,
that one can't be touched?

1136
01:11:05,979 --> 01:11:08,531
- If they do, you can't touch it.
- Then just lock yours down.

1137
01:11:08,532 --> 01:11:12,323
We shouldn't have won first place then.

1138
01:11:12,951 --> 01:11:16,734
[The privilege of being first place
not sitting well with Mom Jung Ah.]

1139
01:11:16,735 --> 01:11:20,693
- Listen to what Yeom Jung Ah says!
- She can beat us up.

1140
01:11:22,456 --> 01:11:23,733
- I saw it...
- What?

1141
01:11:23,734 --> 01:11:27,774
[It's a huge power to be able to protect
one of their own Ddak-ji's...]

1142
01:11:27,775 --> 01:11:30,419
- Then tell them to go first.
- Tell the other team to go first then.

1143
01:11:30,420 --> 01:11:33,759
- What's the use of being first place?
- Okay then, we'll go first.

1144
01:11:33,760 --> 01:11:36,002
But they can't touch the ones
we made, right?

1145
01:11:36,003 --> 01:11:37,962
Why can't we touch it?

1146
01:11:41,196 --> 01:11:44,225
Why are you doing this?
This is seriously about to drive me crazy!

1147
01:11:44,860 --> 01:11:48,798
- Explain it to Jung Ah in detail.
- I'm not explaining it to her!

1148
01:11:48,799 --> 01:11:50,286
Her understanding is correct!

1149
01:11:52,337 --> 01:11:54,363
<i>How did you guys all get here so quickly?</i>

1150
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,879
[How are you guys so slow?]

1151
01:11:57,880 --> 01:12:00,970
Mi Sun is really pouty right now
for being last all the time.

1152
01:12:00,971 --> 01:12:04,437
[Now that we think about it,
Kwang Soo's Team has been last all day.]

1153
01:12:04,438 --> 01:12:06,339
She says that her son is useless.

1154
01:12:07,364 --> 01:12:09,631
He pout is big as a trumpet right now!

1155
01:12:17,542 --> 01:12:22,665
[To trade and protect,
put out all their Ddak-ji in possession.]

1156
01:12:22,666 --> 01:12:26,335
[Offering the opportunity to hit
the opposing team's Ddak-ji.]

1157
01:12:26,336 --> 01:12:27,727
Then we're going to give it a hit!

1158
01:12:27,728 --> 01:12:30,921
Seriously... she's really angry right now!

1159
01:12:30,922 --> 01:12:34,525
Second place... I just
want to get at least second place.

1160
01:12:36,512 --> 01:12:38,975
Don't complain it about it so much.
We have the pride of being in last place too.

1161
01:12:38,976 --> 01:12:41,553
Her skills are totally our level.

1162
01:12:42,694 --> 01:12:44,658
The opportunity to hit others.

1163
01:12:44,659 --> 01:12:46,452
Just once... hit it just once.

1164
01:12:48,167 --> 01:12:51,757
[Jong Kook's Team's extremely powerful
newspaper Ddak-ji.]

1165
01:12:56,469 --> 01:12:58,358
[Not even budging]

1166
01:12:58,359 --> 01:13:00,660
Let's keep it...
let's keep our newspaper Ddak-ji.

1167
01:13:01,088 --> 01:13:03,717
- Keep it, keep it.
- Let's keep this one.

1168
01:13:05,114 --> 01:13:07,452
- Since it's good for attacking...
- That's a piece of art right there.

1169
01:13:07,453 --> 01:13:09,257
- Then is it our turn?
- Yes.

1170
01:13:09,258 --> 01:13:11,356
<i>Take that one. That's a good one.</i>

1171
01:13:12,550 --> 01:13:16,171
[Jae Suk testing out
Kwang Soo's hardboard Ddak-ji.]

1172
01:13:19,254 --> 01:13:21,021
[Immoveable]

1173
01:13:22,182 --> 01:13:23,822
Keep on hitting it.

1174
01:13:30,368 --> 01:13:31,531
For us...

1175
01:13:31,531 --> 01:13:34,376
[Taking Kwang Soo's Team's
hardboard Ddak-ji.]

1176
01:13:42,299 --> 01:13:44,589
<i>When it comes to Ddak-ji,
Jae Suk's good.</i>

1177
01:13:44,590 --> 01:13:50,254
The last time... when
Yeon Jae and Tae Hwan were on...

1178
01:13:51,455 --> 01:13:52,585
Ddak-ji!

1179
01:13:54,236 --> 01:13:58,958
[He thought that when it came to Ddak-ji,
he ruled the game...]

1180
01:13:58,959 --> 01:14:03,105
[He was forced to face failure without even a
chance to hit with Mr. Capable's entrance.]

1181
01:14:03,762 --> 01:14:05,985
What's the point if I'm good at Ddak-ji
when I don't even get the opportunity?

1182
01:14:05,986 --> 01:14:07,352
<i>Chance?</i>

1183
01:14:07,685 --> 01:14:10,201
Chance, my butt...

1184
01:14:10,589 --> 01:14:12,658
[Just wait and see...]

1185
01:14:14,959 --> 01:14:17,452
<i>Please come up and take a letter
that your Mother has written for you.</i>

1186
01:14:17,453 --> 01:14:19,644
She sure writes a lot of letters...

1187
01:14:23,847 --> 01:14:27,342
<i>[My sons, you have all made it.]</i>

1188

<i>[Upgrade your Ddak-ji through this mission
and challenge the Absolute Ddak-ji.]</i>

by placing it on the frying pan.]

1190

<i>You have a total of five chances.</i>

1191
01:14:38,253 --> 01:14:44,385
<i>Starting with number one,
one, two, three, four and finally five.</i>

1192
01:14:45,612 --> 01:14:50,112
[All five have to succeed in procession
for them to succeed the mission.]

1193
01:14:51,281 --> 01:14:52,851
- No practices.
- No we have to practice too.

1194
01:14:52,886 --> 01:14:55,361
No, we have to practice too.
Let them practice once.

1195
01:14:55,362 --> 01:15:00,215
Even when Mi Sun first came on the show,
she had a fresh baby looking face...

1196
01:15:01,308 --> 01:15:03,569
<i>But as the day wears on,
she's starting to revert to her age.</i>

1197
01:15:04,620 --> 01:15:06,124
Her scary Mom voice even came out.

1198
01:15:06,704 --> 01:15:08,621
- Kwang Soo...
- This is too hard!

1199
01:15:09,338 --> 01:15:10,619
What is this?

1200
01:15:12,783 --> 01:15:14,428
Hurry up and practice.

1201
01:15:14,429 --> 01:15:16,876
[Each team gets two tries.]

1202
01:15:20,338 --> 01:15:22,686

[Will he...]

1206
01:15:36,968 --> 01:15:39,505
[He didn't flip it over...]

1207
01:15:43,502 --> 01:15:45,549
I haven't even gotten to do it once!

1208
01:15:48,365 --> 01:15:50,742
[Gary's family's second attempt.]

1209
01:15:50,967 --> 01:15:52,571
- Fighting!
- Fighting!

1210
01:15:55,113 --> 01:15:57,390
[Ji Hyo succeeds on first try!]

1211
01:15:58,912 --> 01:16:00,788
- Ji Hyo's really good...
- Ji Hyo's so good at it.

1212
01:16:03,288 --> 01:16:05,748
[Didn't flip over!]

1213
01:16:10,346 --> 01:16:13,133
[Diffusing the situation with laughter.]

1214
01:16:15,055 --> 01:16:17,973
- Hae Jin's not good at anything.
- This is pretty difficult.

1215
01:16:19,877 --> 01:16:23,914
[Now that we're thinking about it,
he hasn't won a thing today.]

1216
01:16:26,384 --> 01:16:28,675
Hae Jin, come here.
Stand over here.

1217
01:16:30,290 --> 01:16:33,167
Jong Kook... kneel down over there.

1218
01:16:33,168 --> 01:16:36,474
- Kneel down on both knees.
- I don't want to.

1219
01:16:36,475 --> 01:16:38,313
- Why do I have to do that?
- You have to kneel down.

1220
01:16:38,314 --> 01:16:42,027
[The older ones not being able to mutter
a sound when the younger one starts talking]

1221
01:16:42,028 --> 01:16:44,770
You can rest your arm like this
since it's difficult to stay like that.

1222
01:16:44,771 --> 01:16:46,891
- No, I have my own method.
- Really?

1223
01:16:46,892 --> 01:16:49,106
That's a first. That's the first time
Jong Kook ever let anything go.

1224
01:16:49,107 --> 01:16:51,184
[Jong Kook's Team's first attempt.]

1225
01:16:52,752 --> 01:16:54,741
- There you go.
- That's right!

1226
01:16:54,742 --> 01:16:56,648
- That's right...
- He did it!

1227
01:16:56,649 --> 01:16:59,240
[Number one Ha Ha succeeds.]

1228
01:17:11,790 --> 01:17:14,923
[Mr. Capable's failure bringing
so much joy to everyone.]

1229
01:17:17,085 --> 01:17:20,759
[Switching their spot and
making their second attempt.]

1230
01:17:23,819 --> 01:17:26,004
[Taking their spot and positions...]

1231
01:17:28,033 --> 01:17:31,144
Lightly... lightly to the back.

1232
01:17:36,749 --> 01:17:42,318
Seriously... Jung Ah... she has a temper
and is very bad at the games.

1233
01:17:46,154 --> 01:17:47,511
What have you done today, Jung Ah?

1234
01:17:47,512 --> 01:17:49,640
Yeom Jung Ah is getting angrier
by the minute.

1235
01:17:51,413 --> 01:17:53,492
- I got it, Jung Ah.
- What do you know?

1236
01:17:53,493 --> 01:17:56,069
- What do you keep saying that you know?
- I got it, come here.

1237
01:17:56,070 --> 01:17:59,176
I got it, Jung Ah.
I figured it out exactly.

1238
01:17:59,177 --> 01:18:01,548
You can't be like this.
We can't lose our teamwork!

1239
01:18:03,218 --> 01:18:05,095
[Kwang Soo's Team's first attempt.]

1240
01:18:05,096 --> 01:18:06,699
Lee Kwang Soo!

1241
01:18:06,700 --> 01:18:08,433
Kwang Soo!

1242
01:18:18,065 --> 01:18:20,869
[Second attempt after
switching out their seats.]

1243
01:18:21,289 --> 01:18:23,093
<i>Jeon Mi Sun!</i>

1244
01:18:23,094 --> 01:18:24,896
- Jeon Mi Sun!
- That looks good!

1245
01:18:25,106 --> 01:18:27,331
Who was it...

1246
01:18:27,904 --> 01:18:29,346
- Jeon Mi Sun!
- That looks good!

1247
01:18:30,136 --> 01:18:31,794
Who was it...

1248
01:18:34,766 --> 01:18:36,153
<i>You can't do that!</i>

1249
01:18:36,154 --> 01:18:39,208
[Fail from Jae Suk's shouting?]

1250
01:18:39,209 --> 01:18:42,176
- You can't shout while we're doing it!
- Did you see Mi Sun's stare?

1251
01:18:44,046 --> 01:18:47,641
[Frigid...]

1252
01:18:47,642 --> 01:18:50,921
[Sae Young's Mom showing her true nature.]

1253
01:18:51,155 --> 01:18:53,325
I can do it during practice,
but I can't do it during actual try.

1254
01:18:53,326 --> 01:18:55,602
<i>Ji Hyo does it as if she's cooking.</i>

1255
01:18:56,491 --> 01:18:58,117
Ji Hyo does it as if she's cooking.

1256
01:18:58,118 --> 01:19:01,729
- How do you do that so well?
- I'm good at flipping fried eggs too.

1257
01:19:01,730 --> 01:19:03,847
Then do it with confidence...
with confidence.

1258
01:19:06,439 --> 01:19:08,640
[Number two Hae Jin also succeeds.]

1259
01:19:17,398 --> 01:19:20,113
[Number three Jae Suk also succeeds.]

1260
01:19:20,114 --> 01:19:22,457
- They figured out a method.
- No!

1261
01:19:23,767 --> 01:19:25,348
<i>Gary won't be able to do it.</i>

1262
01:19:32,632 --> 01:19:34,693
[Wow! A success!]

1263
01:19:36,998 --> 01:19:41,917
[A total of five times.
Now Ji Hyo has to flip it one more time...]

1264
01:19:41,918 --> 01:19:43,375
If she gets the yellow tab,
then we win?

1265
01:19:43,376 --> 01:19:46,212
[Their hopes once again ride
on Ace Ji Hyo.]

1266
01:19:46,213 --> 01:19:51,055
[If she flips it over to the side with
the yellow sticker, they win!]

1267
01:19:57,937 --> 01:20:01,601
[Will she...]

1268
01:20:06,605 --> 01:20:09,721
[It flipped over!]

1269
01:20:09,722 --> 01:20:13,077
[Gary's Team succeeds in flipping them
over five times in a row!]

1270
01:20:15,637 --> 01:20:18,867
[Ji Hyo is definitely Running Man's Ace!]

1271
01:20:18,868 --> 01:20:21,446
- Even during wrestling, you took out two!
- My wife is the best!

1272
01:20:22,321 --> 01:20:24,995
[A reunion for the holidays?]
That's my wife!

1273
01:20:24,996 --> 01:20:28,448
Wow seriously... that was great!

1274
01:20:28,671 --> 01:20:30,310
It's a lot easier than I thought.

1275
01:20:30,311 --> 01:20:33,375
Mi Sun... I think Mi Sun is pissed off.

1276
01:20:37,482 --> 01:20:39,833
<i>The winning team can just relax
and enjoy the food now.</i>

1277
01:20:39,834 --> 01:20:41,552
Yes, we'll enjoy it. Thank you.

1278
01:20:41,553 --> 01:20:43,578
We're just going to eat some pancakes then.

1279
01:20:44,313 --> 01:20:46,741
[Now competing for the second place.]

1280
01:20:46,742 --> 01:20:49,333
Jong Kook... give it a little snap.
You can't do that?

1281
01:20:52,121 --> 01:20:55,170
Try flipping it like you would flip an egg.

1282
01:20:55,171 --> 01:20:57,208
Why make it so hard?

1283
01:20:58,123 --> 01:21:00,895
I'm getting to eat the pancakes and
even see a side show now...

1284
01:21:00,896 --> 01:21:03,612
- It's a dinner show.
- This place has great dinner shows.

1285
01:21:04,607 --> 01:21:06,945
[Jong Kook's Team takes the challenge.]

1286
01:21:06,946 --> 01:21:08,593
Okay, let's go!

1287
01:21:11,148 --> 01:21:13,457
[Number one, Ha Ha succeeds]

1288
01:21:15,427 --> 01:21:17,640
[Number two, Jong Kook succeeds]

1289
01:21:17,641 --> 01:21:22,031
<i>- Jung Ah won't be able to do it.
- Don't be nervous and do it calmly.</i>

1290
01:21:24,125 --> 01:21:26,698
[Number three, Jung Ah succeeds]

1291
01:21:26,699 --> 01:21:29,533
[Whew...]

1292
01:21:29,534 --> 01:21:32,369
[Now flip it back so that
the yellow sticker is back in view!]

1293
01:21:38,035 --> 01:21:40,186
[Oh no...]

1294
01:21:40,187 --> 01:21:43,911
[Number four, Jong Kook fails.]

1295
01:21:45,074 --> 01:21:48,958
[You were almost there...]

1296
01:21:50,636 --> 01:21:53,129
This dinner show is making my
palms sweat!

1297
01:21:53,130 --> 01:21:55,202
The dinner show at this place
is pretty decent!

1298
01:21:56,129 --> 01:21:58,257
That's pathetic, just pathetic...

1299
01:22:00,991 --> 01:22:04,629
All three of them need to get
the feel of it together...

1300
01:22:05,524 --> 01:22:07,772
But since only one of them
is trying to do that...

1301
01:22:07,773 --> 01:22:10,473
[Acting like he's better than anyone.]

1302
01:22:11,911 --> 01:22:13,757
<i>It's okay, it's okay.</i>

1303
01:22:13,758 --> 01:22:16,287
<i>You really don't know until it's over.</i>

1304
01:22:16,288 --> 01:22:18,291
This is the first time
I've seen her like this.

1305
01:22:20,824 --> 01:22:23,118
Hae Jin, just think back to
when you were wrestling.

1306
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:26,556
- Who? Me?
- What about him when he was wrestling?

1307
01:22:26,557 --> 01:22:29,262
- Me?
- Yes, Hae Jin!

1308
01:22:29,263 --> 01:22:31,233
I did it very confidently.

1309
01:22:32,294 --> 01:22:35,829
[His look of confidence...]

1310
01:22:35,830 --> 01:22:38,600
You lost by a margin to Jong Kook earlier.

1311
01:22:38,601 --> 01:22:39,601
Yeah, it was really too bad.

1312
01:22:41,714 --> 01:22:43,746
- I was so close.
- Yes, you were!

1313
01:22:47,058 --> 01:22:50,907
[Jong Kook's team regroups to do it again.]

1314
01:22:54,489 --> 01:22:56,374
[Number one, Ha Ha succeeds]

1315
01:22:57,144 --> 01:22:59,097
[Number two, Jong Kook succeeds]

1316
01:23:00,238 --> 01:23:01,971
[Number three, Jung Ah succeeds]

1317
01:23:02,440 --> 01:23:05,674
[Now they just needs the yellow sticker
to show for their fourth and fifth try!]

1318
01:23:07,758 --> 01:23:10,504
[Number four, Jong Kook succeeds]

1319
01:23:10,505 --> 01:23:13,159
[Now final number five, Ha Ha!]

1320
01:23:13,160 --> 01:23:16,632
[If he flips it over, they
complete the mission in second place!]

1321
01:23:16,633 --> 01:23:19,793
[Will he...]

1322
01:23:29,948 --> 01:23:33,307
[Jong Kook's team succeeds in flipping it
over five times in a row!]

1323
01:23:33,308 --> 01:23:35,198
[All the built up stress, gone!]

1324
01:23:35,199 --> 01:23:37,115
- Yes! Yes!
- Thank goodness!

1325
01:23:37,116 --> 01:23:40,031
[Kwang Soo's Team in last place again.]

1326
01:23:40,829 --> 01:23:43,938
<i>You can't think about this...
no hesitations, and just do it.</i>

1327
01:23:43,939 --> 01:23:46,477
Your team doesn't even need to do it
since you're in last place, right?

1328
01:23:48,554 --> 01:23:50,318
<i>Are you trying to upset them
even more right now?</i>

1329
01:23:50,319 --> 01:23:52,246
There's the Ddak-ji match later anyways.

1330
01:23:53,748 --> 01:23:56,432
- You did really good.
- I did good, right?

1331
01:23:58,139 --> 01:24:02,553
[Supplies to upgrade the Ddak-ji's.]

1332
01:24:02,554 --> 01:24:06,136
[Just what are the supplies to
help upgrade their Ddak-ji?]

1333
01:24:06,137 --> 01:24:09,616
<i>Okay, I'm going to reveal them.
One, two, three!</i>

1334
01:24:09,617 --> 01:24:14,904
[Masking tape, glue stick, stapler]

1335
01:24:16,327 --> 01:24:19,746
- Tape... let's get the tape.
- We just need one of the two.

1336
01:24:19,747 --> 01:24:23,001
[The first place winner gets the option
to make the first selection.]

1337
01:24:23,002 --> 01:24:26,149
[What shall they use amongst these...]

1338
01:24:26,150 --> 01:24:27,524
<i>Come on, do it quickly.</i>

1339
01:24:28,435 --> 01:24:35,960
[Gary's team's selection]
We'll go with the tape.

1340
01:24:38,916 --> 01:24:42,191
- Why is there only this much?
- There's not much there?

1341
01:24:42,192 --> 01:24:44,271
<i>That's right.
They shouldn't be giving you too much.</i>

1342
01:24:44,272 --> 01:24:45,636
What the heck is this?

1343
01:24:45,863 --> 01:24:49,876
[Barely enough left to go around the roll
maybe three to four times.]

1344
01:24:50,837 --> 01:24:52,790
Look at the tape!

1345
01:24:52,791 --> 01:24:55,137
- That's all of it?
- What kind of a deal is this?

1346
01:24:55,138 --> 01:24:56,319
[We're in trouble...]

1347
01:24:57,840 --> 01:25:00,148
We can use that glue stick a lot.

1348
01:25:00,149 --> 01:25:05,233
Ours is made of newspaper...
newspaper sticks very well together.

1349
01:25:05,234 --> 01:25:07,073
I'm really sick of it...
so totally sick of it.

1350
01:25:09,019 --> 01:25:11,988
If you were going to be like that,
why didn't you just become a scientist then?

1351
01:25:12,186 --> 01:25:14,341
- Save everyone the trouble...
- Kwang Soo, Kwang Soo...

1352
01:25:14,342 --> 01:25:18,633
[After getting it all off his chest,
apologizing immediately.]

1353
01:25:18,634 --> 01:25:21,456
The stapler may not even be able to
go through our newspaper at all.

1354
01:25:21,457 --> 01:25:25,328
[Through Mr. Capable's needling,
they choose the glue stick.]

1355
01:25:25,329 --> 01:25:28,125
- Okay... look at this!
- Think about it, it's a good choice.

1356
01:25:28,126 --> 01:25:30,890
Hey, we originally wanted the stapler
for ourselves anyways.

1357
01:25:30,891 --> 01:25:32,506
[Kwang Soo's Team automatically
gets the stapler.]

1358
01:25:32,507 --> 01:25:35,705
[But there doesn't appear to be
enough staples.]

1359
01:25:37,203 --> 01:25:38,886
- Show Mi Sun, show it to her.
- No, don't show it to her!

1360
01:25:38,887 --> 01:25:41,065
Don't show it to her!
She's going to get annoyed!

1361
01:25:43,150 --> 01:25:45,940
<i>Take a look! See for yourself!</i>

1362
01:25:46,796 --> 01:25:47,953
What the heck is this?

1363
01:25:54,981 --> 01:25:58,724
[Gary's Team,
upgrading their cardboard Ddak-ji.]

1364
01:26:03,830 --> 01:26:07,010
[Complete after all the effort
put in with the tape!]

1365
01:26:07,766 --> 01:26:09,644
I think this is good.

1366
01:26:09,645 --> 01:26:12,030
We got ourselves a good one.

1367
01:26:12,031 --> 01:26:13,825
It sticks very nicely.

1368
01:26:16,907 --> 01:26:21,433
[Jong Kook's team
upgrading with their glue stick.]

1369
01:26:25,917 --> 01:26:28,871
[Is that Ddak-ji, or a land mine?]

1370
01:26:30,076 --> 01:26:31,881
Let's staple this part.
One, two, three.

1371
01:26:33,130 --> 01:26:38,096
[Kwang Soo's team making theirs stronger
with the use of the stapler.]

1372
01:26:38,097 --> 01:26:40,949
- It keeps coming back out though.
- That's not going to do.

1373
01:26:45,283 --> 01:26:48,234
[Envious...]
You're jealous, aren't you?

1374
01:26:49,427 --> 01:26:53,143
- We're going to slate once.
- I'll do it!

1375
01:26:54,410 --> 01:26:57,710
I'm going to hit the slate.
One, two, three!

1376
01:27:01,633 --> 01:27:03,082
[The final location. The place
where Absolute Ddak-ji lies in wait.]

1377
01:27:03,083 --> 01:27:06,598
[To Sam-choen-ggak.]

1378
01:27:06,599 --> 01:27:10,402
[All the teams pulling everything out of
their pockets to take the cab!]

1379
01:27:10,403 --> 01:27:12,412
Sam-cheon-gaak in
Cheon-buk-dong, please.

1380
01:27:13,086 --> 01:27:16,992
The important when we get there is,
not beating the other team's Ddak-ji...

1381
01:27:16,993 --> 01:27:21,125
- but the Absolute Ddak-ji...
- Flipping that over, right?

1382
01:27:21,126 --> 01:27:24,014
[They have to flip over the Absolute Ddak-ji
with the ones they have in possession!]

1383
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:27,608
[All three teams arrives
almost simultaneously!]

1384
01:27:31,913 --> 01:27:35,975
[Jong Kook's team is the first
to enter the place!]

1385
01:27:35,976 --> 01:27:37,576
Go! Go!

1386
01:27:38,466 --> 01:27:42,546
[What awaits for them inside?]

1387
01:27:42,547 --> 01:27:45,132
- What is it?
- What is this? It's scary.

1388
01:27:45,133 --> 01:27:47,138
- What is it?
- It's not scary, Jung Ah. Come in.

1389
01:27:49,768 --> 01:27:52,058
[A set of doors blocking their path.]

1390
01:27:56,274 --> 01:27:59,132
[Past those doors...]

1391
01:28:13,111 --> 01:28:18,622
[This is... Absolute Ddak-ji!]

1392
01:28:23,493 --> 01:28:25,594
<i>- See? It's scary!
- Mom!</i>

1393
01:28:25,595 --> 01:28:29,380
<i>- Mom! Mom!
- Grandmother!</i>

1394
01:28:29,381 --> 01:28:31,748
[This is the Ddak-ji creator,
Mrs. Go Dong Wan?]

1395
01:28:31,749 --> 01:28:34,744
- That's my mom. Oh look, there it is!
- Hello.

1396
01:28:40,846 --> 01:28:43,813
What you see there in front of you
is the Absolute Ddak-ji.

1397
01:28:44,212 --> 01:28:48,043
[Taking turns between the teams to try
and flip over the Ddak-ji.]

1398
01:28:48,044 --> 01:28:53,852
[An extraordinary inheritance will be
given to the family that flips it over.]

1399
01:28:55,976 --> 01:28:59,017
I will reveal to you my legacy before
you start the Ddak-ji match.

1400
01:28:59,018 --> 01:29:00,897
- What is it?
- What could it be?

1401
01:29:00,898 --> 01:29:03,317
- Is it a beef rib set?
- My legacy is this.

1402
01:29:03,318 --> 01:29:08,018
[Solid gold plaque]

1403
01:29:08,019 --> 01:29:09,918
- It's written in gold!
- It's gold!

1404
01:29:09,919 --> 01:29:12,027
Wow... that's really cool!

1405
01:29:12,028 --> 01:29:14,535
<i>[Run, don't walk]</i>

1406
01:29:14,536 --> 01:29:17,631
Once a family fails after trying
with both their Ddak-ji's...

1407
01:29:17,632 --> 01:29:20,332
then the opportunity goes to the
next team.

1408
01:29:21,355 --> 01:29:23,590
We get to try out both of them?
It's not just one?

1409
01:29:23,591 --> 01:29:25,657
- You get to try them both.
- But we just need to flip it over once?

1410
01:29:25,658 --> 01:29:28,052
- But we just need to turn it over once?
- That's right.

1411
01:29:28,053 --> 01:29:29,618
- That's right.
- Talking down...

1412
01:29:31,125 --> 01:29:32,784
[Letting it go since he's playing his Mother.]

1413
01:29:34,796 --> 01:29:38,444
Even though that Ddak-ji is great at defense,
I don't know about attacking.

1414
01:29:38,445 --> 01:29:42,146
[Attacking first with
the monstrous newspaper Ddak-ji.]

1415
01:29:43,549 --> 01:29:46,603
[It's gigantic enough,
but it's been upgraded with the glue stick!]

1416
01:29:51,729 --> 01:29:54,750
[Mega-monstrous newspaper Ddak-ji!]

1417
01:29:54,751 --> 01:29:59,637
[Challenging the Absolute Ddak-ji!]

1418
01:30:07,514 --> 01:30:09,541
- Wow, they're even beating the drums!
- Wow...

1419
01:30:09,542 --> 01:30:12,103
What's so significant about Ddak-ji
that you're even beating the drum?

1420
01:30:12,104 --> 01:30:14,024
Is this some sacred Ddak-ji or something?

1421
01:30:20,249 --> 01:30:22,392
[He's making his move...]

1422
01:30:26,845 --> 01:30:30,075
- I think he's going to flip it...
- Just shatter the ground. Shatter it.

1423
01:30:31,493 --> 01:30:33,136
<i>- Shatter the ground!
- here I go!</i>

1424
01:30:33,137 --> 01:30:34,897
<i>- Shatter the ground!
- here I go!</i>

1425
01:30:38,197 --> 01:30:39,537
Here I go!

1426
01:30:42,527 --> 01:30:46,439
[Do you know the danger of
Absolute Ddak-ji?]

1427
01:30:48,658 --> 01:30:51,826
[Simulation...
158th attempt to flip it over.]

1428
01:30:51,827 --> 01:30:57,785
[Number of times it's been flipped over...
zero.]

1429
01:30:58,729 --> 01:31:04,545
[Do you think you'll be able to flip over
this Absolute Ddak-ji?]

1430
01:31:35,711 --> 01:31:37,720
[Wait...]

1431
01:31:37,721 --> 01:31:39,679
[What... the...]

1432
01:31:39,680 --> 01:31:42,831
[Wait... what...the heck...]

1433
01:31:42,832 --> 01:31:45,070
Did that really happen?

1434
01:31:46,979 --> 01:31:50,164
- Did that really happen?
- Seriously... did that really happen?

1435
01:31:50,165 --> 01:31:55,676
[It flipped over... in one shot...]

1436
01:31:55,677 --> 01:31:58,826
How in the world did that happen?

1437
01:31:58,827 --> 01:32:01,156
[Oh crap...]

1438
01:32:01,612 --> 01:32:06,221
[The writers and
members are all frozen in place like ice.]

1439
01:32:06,222 --> 01:32:07,806
How is this Absolute Ddak-ji?

1440
01:32:09,471 --> 01:32:13,169
[Who knew it would flip over like that...]

1441
01:32:13,170 --> 01:32:15,694
- Here, try to flip it over.
- Try it.

1442
01:32:15,695 --> 01:32:18,244
- What the heck is this?
- Flip it... try and flip it over.

1443
01:32:18,245 --> 01:32:20,802
I'm speechless right now.

1444
01:32:20,803 --> 01:32:22,962
Look at PD Myuk's expression right now!

1445
01:32:22,963 --> 01:32:25,299
No one had been able to flip that over...

This Absolute Ddak-ji really is made well...

1450
01:32:47,350 --> 01:32:51,630
- It is made really well.
- His is more like a boulder... a boulder.

1451
01:32:51,631 --> 01:32:54,337
I never got the chance this time either.

1452
01:32:54,338 --> 01:32:58,083
What I would like to say to you is this...
stop talking about Ddak-ji.

[The declining Lord of Ddak-ji?]

1454
