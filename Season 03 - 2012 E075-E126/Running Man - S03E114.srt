Anyways, to our viewers,
we're sorry for making you all worried.

He's returned.

20
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:10,750

is what's important.

we can have another Ddak-ji match today.

- They did this for Ha Ji Won the last time.

35

Yeah, they did something
similar to that back then.

36
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:08,660
And this is similar to when Ji Sung was
on the show too... maybe Ji Sung is back.

come on out!

- Geun Young, have you been well?
- Yes, have you been well?

you acting like you know her well?

past that she's my ideal woman.

to speak up a little louder.</i>

- Why are you calling it that?

Yes, I know.

82

some interest in me?

Yes, Gary is the reason why I
watch Running Man.

84

- Yes.

- I can't quit now!
- He says he can't quit now...

89

I'm going to keep doing
the show for Geun Young.

has been on screen like this.

- Yes, I saw it!

[Muscle Boy with a lot of things
to show off today.]

the wrestling portion too?

You were the best!

[His self-confidence that's been crumbled
to shambles in front of Geun Young.]

99
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:21,350
With how the things are set up today,
aren't you reminded of X-man?

100
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:23,500
Why is this out here?

101
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:28,750
When we did our X-man thing,
this is what we used for dance initiation.

102
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:30,180
Yeah, I remember that.

103
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:34,160

[The memorable dance initiations.]

105
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:49,700
All the staff that we have now are the same
ones we had when we did X-man in the past.

106
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:51,850
Why don't we revive those old memories?

107
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:54,780
You know Jong Kook's moves for this, right?
The move that we couldn't stand.

108
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:56,150
Yeah, this move.

109
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:59,930
Whenever we asked him to get up there,
he'd get up there and do this...

110
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:06,420
[The same music from those times!]

111
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:10,000

he wants to relieve the memories.]

113

- You need to start it. Come on.
- Why am I the one to start it?

114
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:17,160
Having you telling me to do it
all of a sudden is making me feel burdened.

115

[Breaking out the moves!]

116
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:25,100

waiting for this moment.]

117
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:27,660

- Gary!
- Suk Jin, it's Suk Jin's turn.

127
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:02,140
- I don't want to do it...
- No, you have to do it too.

128
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:06,610
[No matter what music is playing,
it's 'Woo-sa' dance.]

129

Ugh, that's gross!

132

Just go back to your shifting.

133

- Wave?
- Wave!

136

[Eyes ablaze... and a serious expression.]

141
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:04,240
- Take off your glasses! Your glasses!
- Look at you dance!

142
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:08,700
[Totally awkward]

143
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:12,740
- Shuffle! Do the shuffle!
- Nice!

144

- He's really good! Look at his dancing!
- He's a really good dancer!

146

It looks like he's been practicing!

147
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:24,550
[Ending it with a lively shake.]

148
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,410
Why are you trying so hard to
dance well?

149
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:34,380
- Do your moves like this!
- Do this move!

150
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:35,640
You know, this move!

151
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,130
- I did all those moves too!
- No, you didn't! You were seriously trying!

152
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:40,730
It's because Miss Moon is on the show!

153

[Putting in an effort because
Geun Young is watching?]

155
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,600
Anyway...

156
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,810
it's been a really long time since
we've done the dance initiation like that.

157
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:52,560
That was really energizing.

158
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,280
- How are the teams being divided?
- Today's mission...

159
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,560
<i>Is X-man vs. Running Man.</i>

160
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,400
There's an X-man amongst us then?

161
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,150
What is X-Man vs. Running Man?

162
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:08,040
<i>Do you all remember how an X-man
is selected?</i>

163
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:10,990
'You are not the X-man'.

164
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:12,160

Geun Young, which he never does...

it's the first time he's ever said
anything like that!

169

This is the first time he's ever said anything
about liking any of our female guests.

- Really?
- Yes, this is the first time.

be the X-man every round that they win.</i>

- The team that wins?

182

trade for Geun Young without regards to X-man.

the special mission by the final mission...</i>

187

any regards to any of the teams.</i>

then X-man would be the ultimate winner.</i>

something special then, right?

<i>Please wait for them.</i>

327
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,880
How many times have I told you not to
make her feel uncomfortable?

328
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,640
- Why, Jong Kook? What's wrong with you?
- Don't you think we're being casual?

329
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,880
[Barely containing his smile
from the happiness he feels?]

330
00:17:12,850 --> 00:17:14,760
Just be casual and
make Geun Young feel comfortable.

331
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:15,890
Do you like Geun Young?

332
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:17,140
<i>Of course!</i>

333
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:19,500
I said, stop it!

334
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:22,780
Why is it that you can only
look in our direction?

335
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:24,760
Do you see how they're both standing
with their hands in their pockets?

336
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:30,560
I said, stop it...

337
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,070
No way!

338
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:35,320
Treat Geun Young comfortably
like any other time we've had guests.

339
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,810
We should make it fun for her...

340
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:39,940
Then shall we link arms
and shout 'Fighting'?

341
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:43,820
[No matter what he ends up saying,
those two pounce on his words.]

342
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:46,450
- She's like your little sister!
- Just do it!

343
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:48,860
- Let's just all do it together!
- Fine! She is like my little sister!

344
00:17:55,230 --> 00:17:56,870
They were in each other's arms!

345
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:02,390
[Roro and the Giraffe having too much fun.]

346
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:06,580
[Red Team arrives]

347
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:13,170
- Miss Moon...
- Yes?

348
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:15,280
- Did you have a nice ride here?
- Yes, I did.

349
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,790
Things are going very well
for these two right now.

350
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:20,210
- No, no, no! It's not like that.
- Then are you my Sister-in-law now?

351
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:22,800
- They were even in each other's arms!
- Seriously?

352
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:26,070
- He still hasn't gotten over Eun Hye yet.
- Seriously!

353
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:29,920
- I said, don't do that!
- I said, okay!

354
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:32,690
Why? Are you embarrassed about it?

355
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,460
Do you know how he drove here?
He drove like this.

356
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:37,480
[Showing off his embarrassed driving style]

357
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,800
When did I do that?

358
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:41,630
I was about to make a turn!
That's why!

359
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:46,650
<i>Your first mission is... Catch the tail.</i>

360
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:48,390
- That sounds like fun!
- But...

361
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:50,200
<i>This catch the tail is to rip off the
name tag.</i>

362
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:53,410
<i>The team with a surviving member wins.</i>

363
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:56,520
Grab on like that?
Do we all have tails then?

364
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:59,110
Do we have tails or not?
I seriously don't get it.

365
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:00,870
[Impala's weakness to outdoors...]

366
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:04,830
- Geun Young...
- Yes?

367
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:08,500
[Each team's tails are Ha Ha vs. Jae Suk.]

368
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,660
[The key is to rotate as fast as you can
towards the other team.]

369
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:13,900
Geun Young grabbed me.

370
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,480
What am I supposed to do now?

371
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:24,220
[Big nosed brother with his eyes
on Ha Ha's name tag?]

372
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:27,120
[Haroro escaping with lightning speed.]

373
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:35,070
[Ha Ha taking this opportunity!]

374
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:39,280
[Jae Suk's name tag!]

375
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:48,500
[Desperately holding onto the name tag!]

376
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:55,540
[Red Team in danger!]

377
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:58,410
[Huh?]

378
00:19:58,410 --> 00:20:00,590
Hey! What are you doing?

379
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:05,400
[Kook not able to see anything
in front of him.]

380
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:19,260
We can tear it off... it's almost there.

381
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:21,230
What the heck are you doing?

382
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:27,330
Listen... I think Kwang Soo is X-man.

383
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:29,040
- Why me?
- It's Kwang Soo.

384
00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:31,250
- Why me?
- He covered me up on purpose with my hood.

385
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:34,160
Jong Kook, you didn't see it,
but Kwang Soo's expression was real.

386
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:38,900
[Stopping in the middle of the game
to point fingers at Kwang Soo as X-man.]

387
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:40,880
But this catch the tail game is pretty fun.

388
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:45,670
[Without regards to winning or X-man,
he's just having fun playing catch the tail.]

389
00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:48,360
I've never played anything like this before.
This is so much fun.

390
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:51,730
This is one of game show basics.

391
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:54,120
I've never played it before though.
I've just heard people talk about it.

392
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:57,780
[That aside...
Is Kwang Soo really the X-man?]

393
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:59,300
- Fighting!
- Fighting.

394
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:02,640
- Fighting!
- Fighting!

395
00:21:06,530 --> 00:21:08,600
- Grab him... just grab him
- Grab him!

396
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,300
Grab him, grab him!

397
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:15,300
[Tail Kwang Soo with his eye on
Jae Suk's name tag.]

398
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:17,090
He's got us!

399
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:26,010
[With his long arm!]

400
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:30,210
[Giraffe's long arm surprise attack!]

401
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:33,830
- Ji Hyo!
- That's right!

402
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:37,410
[Working with Ji Hyo to get out
of danger!]

403
00:21:37,410 --> 00:21:39,420
<i>Good, good. Bend the arm!</i>

404
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:44,820
[Now Giraffe is the one in danger.]

405
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:46,490
[Help me...]

406
00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:50,000
[Huh?]

407
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,060
[Jae Suk's name tag!]

408
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:56,940
[His name tag... is in Geun Young's hand!]

409
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:59,330
- We got it! Got it!
- When did you rip it off?

410
00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:02,450
- We got it!
- Geun Young got it!

411
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,840
[Surprise attack that happened
in a span of moments.]

412
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:12,320
[During the moment that Jae Suk and
Ji Hyo were tangled up together...]

413
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:15,960
[With the speed of light,
Geun Young eliminates his name tag!]

414
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:19,620
[Amazing sense of competitiveness!]

415
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,280
- Fighting!
- That was the best!

416
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:24,070
- Oh goodness!
- That's crazy!

417
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:26,490
- That was awesome!
- Geun Young is awesome!

418
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:29,130
[Totally bowled over by
Geun Young's competitiveness.]

419
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:31,060
That's unbelievable!

420
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:33,330
Those name tags aren't easy to
tear off either!

421
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:35,600
Jae Suk is acting strange.

422
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:39,700
[Being cast suspicious as soon as
his name tag has been ripped off.]

423
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:42,290
- He showed his back to me.
- She said you turned your back on her.

424
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:45,440
- You kept turning your back towards me.
- See? She said you turned your back!

425
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:49,340
- Miss Moon, when did I do that?
- You were practically begging me to rip it.

426
00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:52,000
I was so busy trying to fight off
these two!

427
00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:54,350
- I think he's the X-man...
- Seriously...

428
00:22:54,360 --> 00:23:00,200
[Is Jae Suk really the X-man?]

429
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:02,470
- Okay, let's go.
- Okay!

430
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:03,850
[Blue Team's 4 vs. Red Team's 3]

431
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,510
Please don't stare at me like that!

432
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:10,920
You think I'll go easy on you?
There's no way.

433
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:14,270
He's got him, he's got him.
Hold onto him!

434
00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:18,550
[Blocking the lead right away.]

435
00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:23,060
[Each team's tails are Ji Hyo and
Kwang Soo.]

436
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:24,920
Get him, get him!

437
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:28,720
[Blank Ji on the attack!]

438
00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:33,070
[Going up face to face with the Giraffe.]

439
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:36,050
<i>Ji Hyo, Ji Hyo, Ji Hyo!</i>

440
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:43,010
That's right! Good!

441
00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:44,470
What is this?

442
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,820
Wait! What are you doing?

443
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:52,560
[His hooded sweatshirt has been taken off...]

444
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:54,560
You can't take off my shirt!

445
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,820
Where's my name tag!

446
00:23:59,970 --> 00:24:03,050
[Giraffe's deeply hidden sweatshirt.]

447
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:04,880
- Where is it?
- Where did it go?

448
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,160
- Here it is, here it is.
- Catch the tail is so much fun!

449
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,470
Here? Is it here?

450
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:17,930
[Blank Ji's definitive chance!]

451
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:20,940
[Damn...]

452
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:25,250
You're doing good, Ji Hyo. Great job!

453
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,260
[Normally impossible Man vs. Woman match.]

454
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:42,940
[How can this be? Geun Young
quickly rips off another name tag!]

455
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,410
She ripped it off again?

456
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:51,750
- You're a killer!
- You're totally a killer!

457
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:53,540
- She's a killer!
- This is unbelievable!

458
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:55,770
Moon Geun Young is not the X-man.

459
00:24:55,770 --> 00:24:59,160
There's no way Geun Young is the X-man.
She really doesn't act like one.

460
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:01,200
Geun Young could be the X-man,
but she may just be overly excited right now.

461
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:05,280
Seriously...
how does she rip them off like that?

462
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,020
- This is really unbelievable.
- It is unbelievable.

463
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:08,620
This makes no sense!

464
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:11,580
Why do you keep picking games that
use strength lately?

465
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:15,200
How can you say that? Can you
say that when Geun Young's doing it?

466
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,170
What you're saying isn't right.

467
00:25:17,170 --> 00:25:18,230
It's all strength based...

468
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:20,010
If you don't use your strength at something,
what is it that you're good at?

469
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,880
- Why don't you tell me?
- Look here... what did you say?

470
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,300
I said, if you don't use your strength,
what is it that you can do?

471
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:29,550
How old are you?

472
00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:32,190
- What year were you born?
- I was born in '79. Why?

473
00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:35,090
- Seriously...
- You're going to win for being old?

474
00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:38,360
- Then I guess your team wins!
- Watch your mouth!

475
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:43,440
[Impala getting worked up over
the age talk.]

476
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:46,400
<i>This is really exhausting.</i>

477
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,950
Let's go grab him...
he's going down anyways.

478
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:51,730
[Plans to win by blocking the lead
and with Geun Young's speed.]

479
00:25:51,730 --> 00:25:54,450
[Blue Team's 4 vs. Red Team's 2]

480
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,460
It's over once you grab onto him
using your strength.

481
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:04,010
[Cutting them off from their
ability to move.]

482
00:26:04,010 --> 00:26:06,600
[Now it's Geun Young's turn
to rip the name tag.]

483
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,850
I can't get a grip on it because
it's being blocked!

484
00:26:08,850 --> 00:26:11,720
- If we're stuck like this...
- Got it! We got it!

485
00:26:14,090 --> 00:26:15,260
We got it!

486
00:26:16,130 --> 00:26:19,460
[The Blue Team easily wins again!]

487
00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:23,380
You said that it was fun, Suk Jin.
You liked playing catch the tail...

488
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:25,770
- I'm just going to have fun.
- End it quickly.

489
00:26:25,770 --> 00:26:28,220
- Get it over with quickly.
- I'm going in.

490
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:30,820

- We like it.
- Isn't this how it usually works?

- It really isn't me!
- I'm positive that it's Kwang Soo.

520

Isn't Jae Suk more suspicious
for acting like this?

521

- No, you're strange.
- You're acting strange.

- Since you're not the X-man.

- I'll act as the ex-boyfriend today.

- Right now, I think it's Jong Kook.
- Jong Kook?

543

- Yes.
- Why all of a sudden?

is really bothering me.

carrying out a mission or something.

549

Jong Kook is most opportunistic
when it comes to things like that.

out three and that's what pops out

then that person will step back
from the rest of the team.

- You make things more complicated!

- It's Kwang Soo's turn.

I didn't say anything about arm wrestling,
but everyone told me to write it down.

739

What does that tell me? It means
our team must win no matter what.

740

820
00:44:25,710 --> 00:44:28,710
I'm usually pretty good at
staring contests.

821
00:44:28,710 --> 00:44:31,560
- I know, you're pretty good at it.
- But I didn't sleep much, so I'm tired...

822
00:44:38,210 --> 00:44:40,180
But Jong Kook usually is good at
staring contests.

823
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:42,340
- I'm usually good at it...
- Even in the past...

824
00:44:42,340 --> 00:44:45,970
Jong Kook doesn't get to
sleep much these days...

825
00:44:45,970 --> 00:44:48,090
You'll be getting even less sleep
from now on.

826
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:51,590
- Because of thoughts of Geun Young?
- From what?

827
00:44:54,220 --> 00:44:57,000
Why don't we do a round of 'Of course'
to loosen things up a little?

828
00:44:58,210 --> 00:44:59,810
Why are you seriously being like that?

829
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:03,810
Ready...

830
00:45:03,810 --> 00:45:05,790
[At last, the staring contest]

831
00:45:08,230 --> 00:45:09,640
This feels strange!

832
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:12,860
They're too far apart! They have
to be closer for a staring contest.

833
00:45:12,860 --> 00:45:14,590
[Making his best effort to calm down.]

834
00:45:14,590 --> 00:45:17,060
Come here,
we have to learn things like this.

835
00:45:17,060 --> 00:45:18,990
[Complete attention from the group.]

836
00:45:20,190 --> 00:45:22,160
But wait... we don't have to stare into
each other's eyes, right?

837
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:24,370
- Yes, you do. It's a staring contest.
- we have to stare at each other.

838
00:45:25,620 --> 00:45:28,690
[I want you to stare into my eyes.]

839
00:45:30,110 --> 00:45:31,960
You just stay quiet.

840
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:34,800
- Just be quiet!
- I really want to do a round of 'Of course'.

841
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:39,240
- You have to stare at each other.
- Ready...

842
00:45:41,020 --> 00:45:42,620
Set, go.

843
00:45:44,270 --> 00:45:50,400
[Directly into each other's eyes...]

844
00:45:55,720 --> 00:46:00,230
[One man bursting into laughter.]

845

[Jong Kook's defeat.]

846
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:08,840
- What the heck was that?
- The thing is...

847
00:46:12,190 --> 00:46:14,980
- You must be X-man?
- Are you X-man?

848
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:18,070
- What are you doing?
- Let's do four out of seven!

849
00:46:18,070 --> 00:46:21,560
- What are you doing?
- We don't have to stare at each other...

850
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:23,950
We haven't won once with you in these
matches starting with the arm wrestling!

851
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:28,350
- Stare at her eyebrows then.
- I can't be laughing like this.

852
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:32,900
She says she shouldn't be laughing...
Why do you keep laughing?

853
00:46:33,670 --> 00:46:38,110
Miss Moon... why do you keep laughing
even though you know you shouldn't be?

854
00:46:39,110 --> 00:46:42,610
Why? Why?
You should ask yourself that question.

855
00:46:42,620 --> 00:46:45,080
Why don't you ask yourself
how you really feel?

856
00:46:47,460 --> 00:46:49,910
I don't know...

857
00:46:52,180 --> 00:46:54,410
She's laughing because this is
a funny show!

858
00:46:54,410 --> 00:46:57,600
- It's because our show is funny!
- Look at her... 'I don't know'...

859
00:46:58,540 --> 00:47:00,760
- It's because she's finds this funny.
- Seriously...

860
00:47:01,220 --> 00:47:03,500
[Calming down again...]

861
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:08,290
People standing in the back,
please keep it down.

862

[The man who turned his head
away first.]

863
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:34,110
- Seriously, what are you doing?
- She laughed!

864
00:47:34,110 --> 00:47:36,750
[If she laughs... you don't have a choice?]

865
00:47:36,750 --> 00:47:38,880
Anyways, Moon Geun Young wins!

866
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:45,830
[Mr. Capable's weakness in front
of Geun Young...]

867
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:50,450
Jong Kook is the one who lost
both games for our team.

868
00:47:50,450 --> 00:47:52,650
And both of them to Miss Moon!

869
00:47:53,590 --> 00:47:56,300
Seriously though...
something's strange about that.

870
00:47:56,300 --> 00:47:58,050
- That is strange...
- It is definitely strange.

871
00:47:58,050 --> 00:47:59,330
Don't you feel it's a little strange?

872
00:47:59,330 --> 00:48:02,230
Our team's lost twice and Jong Kook has
lost them both to Miss Moon!

873
00:48:02,230 --> 00:48:03,950
And Jong Kook keeps throwing
off his suspicions onto me!

874
00:48:03,950 --> 00:48:06,110
But he's still not as suspicious as you are!

875
00:48:06,860 --> 00:48:09,300
[Still the most suspicious one is the Giraffe.]

876
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:13,100
That's not it... I'm just bad
at looking into a woman's eyes.

877
00:48:13,100 --> 00:48:15,040
- What about Ji Hyo?
- You're good at staring Ji Hyo.

878
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:17,140
- You're good at staring at me.
- But she's family.

879
00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:20,250
That's why I can stare at her.

880
00:48:22,420 --> 00:48:25,430
[Moving the corn]

881
00:48:26,490 --> 00:48:29,160
- What the heck?
- What was that?

882
00:48:30,180 --> 00:48:32,750
- Moving 20 kernels the fastest...
- Ah, with chopsticks?

883
00:48:32,750 --> 00:48:35,850
- A representative from each team.
- This is the deciding round.

884
00:48:35,850 --> 00:48:39,780
- Go up against Kwang Soo...
- Can we decide who gets to represent?

885
00:48:39,780 --> 00:48:42,350
- No, we get to choose.
- Why don't you choose Kwang Soo then?

886
00:48:42,350 --> 00:48:43,920
Kwang Soo!

887
00:48:43,930 --> 00:48:47,390
- Wait...
- You have to win this no matter what.

888
00:48:47,390 --> 00:48:49,750
- All I have to do is win this, right?
- That's right, you just have to win.

889
00:48:49,750 --> 00:48:53,260
- You can only move one at a time, right?
- Of course.

890
00:48:53,260 --> 00:48:56,780
Kwang Soo... this is a very important
game to you too.

891
00:48:56,780 --> 00:48:57,950
I understand, Jae Suk.

892
00:48:58,090 --> 00:49:00,040
Jae Suk is really good with
his chopsticks too...

893

- You have to win this, okay?
- Of course.

894
00:49:02,770 --> 00:49:04,680

895
00:49:10,090 --> 00:49:12,670
Kwang Soo... you're quicker.
That's right, that's right.

896

Concentrate, concentrate. Don't get nervous.
You're doing fine.

897

That's right, Kwang Soo.
Get the big ones first.

898
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:22,030
- I said, get the big ones first.
- I'm not getting a good grip.

I'm not the X-man!

You saw this, right?
Ji Hyo, you saw?

910
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:14,050
- You saw how they were stuck together, right?
- No, I didn't see anything.

911
00:50:14,060 --> 00:50:17,950
- Why couldn't you have done this?
- Two of the corn kernels were stuck together.

912

00:54:53,410 --> 00:54:55,340
- Kwang Soo...
- Jae Suk...

980
00:54:55,340 --> 00:54:58,030
- What is he doing? Seriously?
- I'm seriously not X-man...

981
00:54:58,030 --> 00:55:00,840
[Giraffe, the biggest suspect...
loses here too...]

982
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:04,010
[Since he lost,
he's not allowed to re-board.]

983
00:55:04,010 --> 00:55:06,240
- Kwang Soo, take care.
- Bye.

984
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:07,940
This isn't the end of me for the day, right?

985
00:55:07,940 --> 00:55:10,700
- Think about what you're doing here.
- Take care, Kwang Soo.

986
00:55:10,700 --> 00:55:13,940
- I'm seriously not X-man! I'm serious!
- Bye!

987
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:18,090
[For now, one member
of the Blue Team is eliminated.]

988
00:55:26,310 --> 00:55:28,270
Why do you think that they won't
trust me?

989
00:55:28,270 --> 00:55:31,730
Let's talk for a bit...
I'm being really serious right now.

990
00:55:32,990 --> 00:55:34,740
Why? Why do you think they
won't trust me?

991
00:55:36,620 --> 00:55:38,880
- What do you think the reason is for that?
- Because you betray them...

992
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:41,460
- Because I betray them?
- Because you betray them a lot...

993
00:55:42,870 --> 00:55:46,500
[The truth even kids are well aware of...]

994
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:51,240
Fine... since it's always like this,
I'm going to betray them to the core.

995
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:54,900
[Does that mean... that he could be...]

996
00:56:02,180 --> 00:56:04,240
- You're wondering what's going on, right?
- Yes.

997
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:06,010
This is nerve-wrecking though.

998
00:56:06,010 --> 00:56:08,250
What is there to be nervous about?

999
00:56:08,490 --> 00:56:12,270
- Right? Nervous because you're not sure...
- Are you nervous?

1000
00:56:12,270 --> 00:56:14,920
- Yes.
- Jae Suk's probably making you even more so.

1001
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:19,180
[Get off at Hogu station!]

1002
00:56:19,180 --> 00:56:21,000
- This is seriously driving me crazy.
- You have to win this.

1003
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:25,570
[The door is open!
Time for the second match.]

1004
00:56:25,570 --> 00:56:28,640
[A match between
two big brothers of Running Man]

1005
00:56:28,650 --> 00:56:32,950
[The result of the two that know
each other so well is?]

1006
00:56:36,410 --> 00:56:38,630
[Who is the winner?]

1007
00:56:51,770 --> 00:56:55,720
[Blue Team's Jae Suk eliminated!]

1008
00:56:56,620 --> 00:57:00,440
Hey, Gary... you have to remain alive!

1009
00:57:00,440 --> 00:57:02,210
Yes, I understand.

1010
00:57:04,780 --> 00:57:07,210
I should've thrown out scissors!

1011
00:57:10,350 --> 00:57:11,980
I should call Kwang Soo.

1012
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,130
It's Jae Suk.

1013
00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:22,400
- Jae Suk...
- Kwang Soo, where are you?

1014
00:57:22,990 --> 00:57:24,790
Right now...

1015
00:57:25,290 --> 00:57:28,130
I'm standing alone at Incheon station.

1016
00:57:28,560 --> 00:57:30,490
- I got eliminated too.
- You did?

1017
00:57:30,490 --> 00:57:33,400
Yeah, I lost the Rock-Paper-Scissors.

1018
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:37,860
- Then there are only two of us left?
- Only Gary and Geun Young's left.

1019
00:57:37,860 --> 00:57:39,950
This is really frustrating.

1020
00:57:39,950 --> 00:57:43,510
Hey, since it's just the tow of us now,
tell me. I won't tell anyone.

1021
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:45,120
Yes, Jae Suk?

1022
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:46,600
<i>You're X-man, aren't you?</i>

1023
00:57:47,580 --> 00:57:50,450
Jae Suk... it really isn't me.

1024
00:57:50,450 --> 00:57:52,560
- You're really not?
- I'm really not.

1025
00:57:53,700 --> 00:57:56,730
- You're sure?
- It really isn't me... it really isn't.

1026
00:57:56,730 --> 00:57:59,510
Why don't we meet up and
we can talk?

1027
00:57:59,510 --> 00:58:02,970
- Call me right away when the train arrives.
- Yes, Jae Suk.

1028
00:58:02,980 --> 00:58:05,160
- Yes, I will.
- Okay, good.

1029
00:58:10,150 --> 00:58:15,070
[Arriving at the third location -
Namdong interspike station]

1030
00:58:23,230 --> 00:58:27,500
[If Gary loses too,
she'll be the only one left remaining.]

1031
00:58:27,500 --> 00:58:32,690
<i>[This time,
it's Rock-Paper-Scissors minus one.]</i>

1032
00:58:32,690 --> 00:58:34,370
Gary, make sure to throw out
two different signs.

1033
00:58:34,370 --> 00:58:35,820
Two different signs, okay?

1034
00:58:36,310 --> 00:58:38,950
[Train has come to a stop.]

1035
00:58:38,950 --> 00:58:43,410
[A difficult match where they have to use
their brain in a short amount of time.]

1036
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:47,090
- Hurry!
- Rock-Paper-Scissors.

1037
00:58:47,090 --> 00:58:48,750
Minus one!

1038
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:50,950
Rock-Paper-Scissors, minus one!

1039
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:52,010
Rock-Paper-Scissors!

1040
00:58:52,010 --> 00:58:55,240
[Wait... this means...]

1041
00:58:55,250 --> 00:58:57,710
Rock-Paper-Scissors, minus one!

1042
00:59:02,290 --> 00:59:05,830
[Blue Team's Gary wins!]

1043
00:59:06,590 --> 00:59:10,140
[Gary wins the Monday Couple match!]

1044
00:59:10,140 --> 00:59:12,360
You could've won...

1045
00:59:13,560 --> 00:59:15,600
- Bye!
- Bye, Ji Hyo...

1046
00:59:16,580 --> 00:59:17,940
Yes, Jae Suk.

1047
00:59:17,940 --> 00:59:19,710
I understand, Jae Suk.

1048
00:59:19,710 --> 00:59:21,930
[The next train for the ones
eliminated finally arrives.]

1049
00:59:23,450 --> 00:59:28,040
[The first to have been eliminated
is the first to get on.]

1050
00:59:37,430 --> 00:59:40,190
[Awkwardly standing alone.]

1051
00:59:41,820 --> 00:59:44,180
- Oh my, you're so handsome!
- Thank you.

1052
00:59:45,020 --> 00:59:47,740
- I feel so embarrassed.
- I watch you on Running Man all the time.

1053
00:59:47,750 --> 00:59:50,520
Looks like that's what he's doing since
he has his name tag on.

1054
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:52,500
Really?

1055
00:59:53,250 --> 00:59:58,010
[All the crowd members slowly
starting to noticed the Giraffe.]

1056
00:59:59,770 --> 01:00:04,740
- Where's Yoo Jae Suk?
- You'll be seeing Yoo Jae Suk soon too.

1057
01:00:06,220 --> 01:00:09,700
[Yoo Jae Suk getting ready to
board the train.]

1058
01:00:10,700 --> 01:00:12,480
Please be careful going home!

1059
01:00:13,710 --> 01:00:17,260
[Second one to have gotten eliminated,
Jae Suk enters.]

1060
01:00:17,260 --> 01:00:19,890
- We...
- Oh, hello.

1061
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:24,870
- Kwang Soo...
- Why are you so bad at Rock-Paper-Scissors?

1062
01:00:24,870 --> 01:00:27,030
Are you here because you're
good at it?

1063
01:00:27,030 --> 01:00:29,200
Why are you and I
so bad at these things?

1064
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:31,690
Because this doesn't have
anything to do with skill.

1065
01:00:31,690 --> 01:00:33,970
This seriously is so frustrating.

1066
01:00:38,190 --> 01:00:42,120
[This time, it's Jong Kook vs. Gary.
Rock-Paper-Scissors behind the safety line.]

1067
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:45,100
Rock-Paper-Scissors!

1068
01:00:45,110 --> 01:00:47,360
Rock-Paper-Scissors!

1069
01:00:47,360 --> 01:00:50,220
[There's a winner! Just who could it be?]

1070
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:55,620
[Revelation]

1071
01:01:03,730 --> 01:01:08,000
[Shock!
Red Team loses twice in a row!]

1072
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:11,690
- Jong Kook, take care.
- Geun Young... bye.

1073
01:01:11,690 --> 01:01:13,700
Bye, Jong Kook!

1074
01:01:14,850 --> 01:01:16,490
<i>Geun Young!</i>

1075
01:01:17,980 --> 01:01:22,810
[A common farewell scene from
melodramas.]

1076
01:01:26,930 --> 01:01:31,610
[Even though he wants to stop the train
from moving with his strength...]

1077
01:01:32,460 --> 01:01:33,860
This is seriously...

1078
01:01:37,300 --> 01:01:38,670
Yes, hello...

1079
01:01:41,290 --> 01:01:43,610
I can't believe... seriously...

1080
01:01:43,610 --> 01:01:45,660
<i>There's only one stop left now.</i>

1081
01:01:45,660 --> 01:01:49,120
<i>The team that wins this round
is the winning team.</i>

1082
01:02:01,630 --> 01:02:04,210
- Geun Young is going to play for our team.
- I will play.

1083
01:02:04,210 --> 01:02:09,040
[Blue Team Geun Young vs. Red Team's Suk Jin]

1084
01:02:09,220 --> 01:02:13,500
[Arriving at the final location which will
determine the fate of each team.]

1085
01:02:14,410 --> 01:02:16,540
<i> It's going to be
Rock-Paper-Scissors minus one.</i>

1086
01:02:16,540 --> 01:02:18,810
[The final game -
Rock-Paper-Scissors minus one.]

1087
01:02:18,810 --> 01:02:22,600
[Which team will be the winner?]

1088
01:02:22,600 --> 01:02:25,130
- We have to win this...
- The final game. Let's go!

1089
01:02:25,130 --> 01:02:28,520
- Let's do this quickly!
- Rock-Paper-Scissors!

1090
01:02:28,520 --> 01:02:30,230
Minus one!

1091
01:02:34,650 --> 01:02:37,610
The stop coming up is the last stop.

1092
01:02:37,610 --> 01:02:39,630
The team that's standing there
is the losing team.

1093
01:02:39,630 --> 01:02:42,440
How could it have come down to
two against two?

1094
01:02:42,440 --> 01:02:45,030
- That was unbelievable.
- It really is unbelievable.

1095
01:02:45,030 --> 01:02:47,610
The team that wins this round gets a hint.

1096
01:02:47,620 --> 01:02:50,590
- An important hint to the winning team.
- Only the winning team gets the hint.

1097
01:02:51,320 --> 01:02:54,190
- Something to stop the mission...
- If the X-man fails the mission...

1098
01:02:54,190 --> 01:02:56,050
Hey, hey, hey...

1099
01:02:58,520 --> 01:03:03,180
[Finally arriving at the station to see
who has been eliminated.]

1100
01:03:03,180 --> 01:03:08,680
[The team who's member is standing
at this station is the losing team!]

1101
01:03:10,300 --> 01:03:13,580
[Who's standing at this station?
Suk Jin or Geun Young?]

1102
01:03:14,450 --> 01:03:18,690
[Oh... a blue shirt?]

1103
01:03:18,690 --> 01:03:20,130
It's Geun Young.

1104
01:03:22,700 --> 01:03:25,530
- Geun Young...
- Geun Young...

1105
01:03:25,530 --> 01:03:27,430
I lost.

1106
01:03:29,860 --> 01:03:33,670
[The final match
at the station a little earlier.]

1107
01:03:33,670 --> 01:03:36,020
Rock-Paper-Scissors, minus one!

1108
01:03:36,020 --> 01:03:38,620
[Big nosed brother wins in an instant!]

1109
01:03:38,620 --> 01:03:42,750
[This is how the Blue Team was defeated.]

1110
01:03:48,680 --> 01:03:53,740
Then it means... our team is going to
get the hint then, right?

1111
01:03:53,740 --> 01:03:56,500
- That's right, the Red Team.
- Tell me what the hint is.

1112
01:03:58,280 --> 01:04:00,340
I bet Jong Kook will really
tell you what it is.

1113
01:04:00,350 --> 01:04:02,170
Jong Kook will tell Geun Young.

1114
01:04:04,020 --> 01:04:05,410
<i>There they are, there they are.</i>

1115
01:04:06,620 --> 01:04:09,030
<i>Read Team won the subway
Rock-Paper-Scissors.</i>

1116
01:04:09,030 --> 01:04:13,320
- You have to trade a member this time too.
- Oh yeah, we have to make the trade.

1117
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:16,050
Whenever I move to a team,
that team keeps losing.

1118
01:04:16,050 --> 01:04:18,550
When I was on that team, that team lost,
not this team...

1119
01:04:18,550 --> 01:04:21,980
So it's you... now that I think about it,
you're the X-man.

1120
01:04:21,980 --> 01:04:24,030
Want to hear my opinion?

1121
01:04:24,030 --> 01:04:27,830
If I were to tell you my opinion...
there's something weird about Kwang Soo.

1122
01:04:27,830 --> 01:04:30,150
- Kwang Soo...
- Something is off about him.

1123
01:04:30,150 --> 01:04:34,700
Games aside, his reaction when we ask
if he's the X-man is really strange.

1124
01:04:34,700 --> 01:04:37,170
- I know...
- I've always been strange to begin with.

1125
01:04:37,520 --> 01:04:40,770
[Finally acknowledging that fact?]

1126
01:04:40,770 --> 01:04:43,590
You have a special thing
you do whenever you lie.

1127
01:04:43,590 --> 01:04:45,820
I think Jae Suk is really suspicious.

1128
01:04:45,820 --> 01:04:48,790
It's not him... he always shows a sign.

1129
01:04:50,010 --> 01:04:52,740
No, Jae Suk doesn't make
things like that noticeable.

1130
01:04:52,740 --> 01:04:55,500
<i>You have to make your decision by
the time I count to three.</i>

1131
01:04:55,500 --> 01:05:00,320
This is the last game here, we have
to get the hint and make the decision.

1132
01:05:01,060 --> 01:05:03,950
-Two... one...
- Hold.

1133
01:05:03,950 --> 01:05:06,300
We're going to stay as we are.

1134
01:05:08,920 --> 01:05:11,050
<i>We will be giving this to the
Red Team only.</i>

1135
01:05:11,060 --> 01:05:13,020
[X-man's mission hint to Red Team only.]

1136
01:05:13,910 --> 01:05:17,430
[Just what is the hint concerning
X-man's mission?]

1137
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:21,700
Let's find out where we're going first.

1138
01:05:22,680 --> 01:05:27,460
<i>[Go to 'S' apartment in Incheon Yeonsugu
and find the Running Man landmark.]</i>

1139
01:05:27,460 --> 01:05:30,310
[What is the X-man mission hint
that they received earlier?]

1140
01:05:30,310 --> 01:05:32,650
[Moon Geun Young]

1141
01:05:33,620 --> 01:05:35,790
- What is that?
- Is it a mission hint?

1142
01:05:36,350 --> 01:05:38,780
Didn't he say we were going to get
something about X-man too?

1143
01:05:38,780 --> 01:05:42,750
This isn't about X-man but about
the mission.

1144
01:05:42,750 --> 01:05:44,860
So this has something to do
with Moon Geun Young?

1145
01:05:44,860 --> 01:05:48,500
So today's X-man has
something to do with Moon Geun Young?

1146
01:05:48,500 --> 01:05:49,700
So it's not Moon Geun Young.

1147
01:05:52,080 --> 01:05:55,130
So does it mean that Moon Geun Young
has to be told something?

1148
01:05:55,130 --> 01:05:57,520
Does it mean that the game
has to be lost to Moon Geun Young?

1149
01:05:58,650 --> 01:06:00,240
You've lost both games to her.

1150
01:06:01,230 --> 01:06:03,780
[Deducing that it may be like that...]

1151
01:06:03,790 --> 01:06:07,180
You're the only one who's lost
to Moon Geun Young.

1152
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:11,880
<i>When I think about it,
it does kind of sound like me.</i>

1153
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:14,400
- That's what I think.
- If I were to be objective about it...

1154
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:19,020
And Kwang Soo...
he keeps high fiving Moon Geun Young.

1155
01:06:19,960 --> 01:06:22,460
<i>Maybe the mission is to high five her.</i>

1156
01:06:22,460 --> 01:06:25,820
- Maybe that's the secret mission?
- He kept doing that to her.

1157
01:06:26,530 --> 01:06:31,660
It's one of the three...
you, Jong Kook or Kwang Soo.

1158
01:06:31,660 --> 01:06:34,110
- There's Jae Suk too.
- It's not Jae Suk.

1159
01:06:34,110 --> 01:06:36,970
It really isn't Jae Suk... I'm sure of it.

1160
01:06:37,470 --> 01:06:40,840
It doesn't matter who suspects who,
but let's pay close attention from now on.

1161
01:06:40,840 --> 01:06:42,800
- Since we're the only ones who know...
- Let's seriously pay close attention.

1162
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:45,680
- This is what's really important.
- Pay close attention to both teams, okay?

1163
01:06:45,680 --> 01:06:47,660
- This is the final mission.
- Okay, okay.

1164
01:06:48,900 --> 01:06:51,820
[Final mission- A park inside
the Incheon apartment complex]

1165
01:06:53,260 --> 01:06:57,180
[In the midst of a large crowd.]

1166
01:06:59,490 --> 01:07:06,100
[In this place...
Running Man makes their entrance.]

1167
01:07:08,810 --> 01:07:12,070
[The crowd gratefully welcoming them.]

1168
01:07:18,390 --> 01:07:23,120
[Feeling of boxers entering the ring.]

1169
01:07:26,600 --> 01:07:28,590
<i>Jong Kook!</i>

1170
01:07:28,590 --> 01:07:30,320
<i>Ha Dong Hoon!</i>

1171
01:07:32,770 --> 01:07:36,390
[But what is the long rope
in the middle of the field?]

1172
01:07:44,740 --> 01:07:47,740
[The Blue Team arriving soon thereafter.]

1173
01:07:49,060 --> 01:07:55,600
[Entering the competition ring while
gratefully being cheered on.]

1174
01:08:05,740 --> 01:08:09,450
[All the Running Man members arrive
at the final mission location.]

1175
01:08:09,450 --> 01:08:13,050
[Just what is the mission in this location?]

1176
01:08:15,230 --> 01:08:17,280
<i>This is your final mission.</i>

1177
01:08:17,280 --> 01:08:20,950
<i>The team that wins this mission
will trade in their suspected X-man</i>

1178
01:08:20,950 --> 01:08:25,690
<i>and will receive an important hint
that'll help you determine who X-man is.</i>

1179
01:08:26,680 --> 01:08:29,740
<i>This mission is something for you to do
together with the crowd.</i>

1180
01:08:29,740 --> 01:08:33,660
<i>What you're going to be doing is,
as you can see behind you, jump roping.</i>

1181
01:08:33,660 --> 01:08:36,740
[Gigantic jump rope]

1182
01:08:36,740 --> 01:08:41,510
<i>It's not about how many times you can jump,
but how many people you can fit in.</i>

1183
01:08:41,510 --> 01:08:44,330
[It's not about the number of jumps,
or how many people can they get to jump.]

1184
01:08:44,330 --> 01:08:45,730
What does that mean?

1185
01:08:45,730 --> 01:08:51,160
[The team that can get most number of people
to jump even once is the winning team.]

1186
01:08:51,160 --> 01:08:54,950
[Each team to recruit 10 members each.]

1187
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:03,350
[Confused as to who they should recruit.]

1188
01:09:04,250 --> 01:09:08,000
The one holding the red cell phone...

1189
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:11,820
And don't you think the one who just
swept her hair back would be good?

1190
01:09:11,820 --> 01:09:15,270
- The one with the black top.
- We have to look at their shoes too.

1191
01:09:15,270 --> 01:09:16,960
- Tennis shoes...
- We have to pick tennis shoes.

1192
01:09:17,820 --> 01:09:19,410
Thank you!

1193
01:09:23,390 --> 01:09:26,120
[Even recruiting an elder who will
be their center.]

1194
01:09:26,120 --> 01:09:27,670
Over there... that man.

1195
01:09:29,930 --> 01:09:32,580
[Recruiting two young men
overflowing with energy.]

1196
01:09:32,580 --> 01:09:36,370
[After a cheerful greeting,
they're now same team members.]

1197
01:09:37,070 --> 01:09:40,220
[Both team's in a critical scouting mode.]

1198
01:09:41,660 --> 01:09:44,250
[Blue Team completes recruiting
10 people for their team!]

1199
01:09:44,250 --> 01:09:46,010
Our team is all set.

1200
01:09:46,630 --> 01:09:49,540
[Red Team also completes recruiting
10 people.]

1201
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:55,210
[Crucial to practice
jumping together as a team.]

1202
01:09:55,210 --> 01:09:56,500
We have to be in sync.

1203
01:09:56,500 --> 01:09:59,870
You have to stare straight ahead
and jump higher than you think.

1204
01:09:59,870 --> 01:10:02,510
You have to bend your legs like this too.

1205
01:10:02,510 --> 01:10:06,290
Are you good at things like this?
Then you should go up front.

1206
01:10:06,290 --> 01:10:09,970
Go up to the front,
and we'll go in the middle.

1207
01:10:11,210 --> 01:10:14,140
- The ones who are in good shape...
- The ones who are fit need to go in first.

1208
01:10:14,140 --> 01:10:17,450
The fit ones up front.
Sir, do you understand?

1209
01:10:17,450 --> 01:10:20,090
I think it would be best for you
to enter last.

1210
01:10:20,100 --> 01:10:21,480
No, I'm very energetic still.

1211
01:10:22,440 --> 01:10:24,520
<i>Pil-Chok-Cross!</i>

1212
01:10:25,780 --> 01:10:30,610
- Fighting...
- The our victory! One, two, three!

1213
01:10:30,610 --> 01:10:32,190
<i>Fighting!</i>

1214
01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:39,350
[We can't lose to them!]

1215
01:10:39,350 --> 01:10:40,720
<i>Fighting!</i>

1216
01:10:42,530 --> 01:10:44,210
[Each team gets three tries.]

1217
01:10:44,210 --> 01:10:51,070
[The team with most people
jumping is the winner!]

1218
01:10:51,070 --> 01:10:55,040
- Yoo Jae Suk!
- Fighting!

1219
01:10:55,040 --> 01:10:59,710
[Each team member
drawing energy from the crowd.]

1220
01:11:01,360 --> 01:11:03,330
You have to cheer us on, okay?

1221
01:11:04,160 --> 01:11:07,510
[Red Team is looking for
any sings of suspicion.]

1222
01:11:08,620 --> 01:11:12,690
[Concentrating on their suspect,
Kwang Soo's expression.]

1223
01:11:12,690 --> 01:11:16,000
- See? He keeps talking to Geun Young.
- He really does keep talking to her.

1224
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:20,430
[Definitely suspicious... talking
to Geun Young at every opportunity.]

1225
01:11:22,090 --> 01:11:24,260
First round! First round!

1226
01:11:24,260 --> 01:11:26,420
[Blue Team's first attempt at jump rope.]

1227
01:11:26,420 --> 01:11:30,510
[14 members per team.
Just how many people will they get to jump?]

1228
01:11:37,120 --> 01:11:38,840
<i>Trust each other!</i>

1229
01:11:40,830 --> 01:11:43,430
[Jae Suk is first to enter the line.]

1230
01:11:43,430 --> 01:11:45,210
<i>Slow... slow!</i>

1231
01:11:49,290 --> 01:11:53,130
[Jae Suk is first to enter,
and second follows soon thereafter.]

1232
01:11:53,730 --> 01:11:57,160
[Number three, Gary.
Number four, a member of the crowd.]

1233
01:11:58,430 --> 01:12:00,510
[Geun Young's turn to enter!]

1234
01:12:08,160 --> 01:12:12,050
[Geun Young slipping and losing her balance!]

1235
01:12:12,750 --> 01:12:17,110
[Will she be able to jump over the rope?]

1236
01:12:26,420 --> 01:12:32,270
[With Geun Young hitting the rope,
the people up front end up stepping on it.]

1237
01:12:32,700 --> 01:12:34,930
[It was quite stable for the first four...]

1238
01:12:34,930 --> 01:12:39,140
[But fails in a moment with a mishap.]

1239
01:12:43,510 --> 01:12:50,860
<i>It's okay! It's okay!</i>

1240
01:12:50,860 --> 01:12:56,450
[Brightening up again through the cheers
of her team and the crowd after her mistake.]

1241
01:12:57,420 --> 01:13:00,550
[Red Team's turn at their first attempt.]

1242
01:13:01,620 --> 01:13:04,570
[Red Team overflowing with energy.]

1243
01:13:04,570 --> 01:13:07,910
[One more cheer for team spirit.]

1244
01:13:10,350 --> 01:13:12,420
Geun Young, don't be nervous.

1245
01:13:12,420 --> 01:13:14,640
- How many did we get?
- Five people...

1246
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:17,290
- You're the fifth?
- Yes, I'm the fifth person.

1247
01:13:17,290 --> 01:13:22,220
Just watch.. and come in right away.
And when you do, just jump high!

1248
01:13:22,220 --> 01:13:24,180
Feel the rhythm, okay?

1249
01:13:25,360 --> 01:13:28,880
- What does that mean?
- You know, the rhythm!

1250
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:30,510
- I'm so nervous!
- Don't be nervous.

1251
01:13:30,510 --> 01:13:32,720
You have to get over your nervousness.

1252
01:13:32,720 --> 01:13:34,930
[The way to victory is
to get over the nervousness.]

1253
01:13:34,930 --> 01:13:37,220
I think I went in too late,
and that's why I jumbled it up.

1254
01:13:37,220 --> 01:13:39,310
[Red Team's first attempt]

1255
01:13:39,310 --> 01:13:42,630
[Just how many members of Red Team
will they be able to get in?]

1256
01:13:49,560 --> 01:13:51,710
[Wow! So many people within moments!]

1257
01:13:51,710 --> 01:13:54,290
[Entering without hesitation!]

1258
01:14:02,540 --> 01:14:07,140
[Already seven people! Now the eighth!]

1259
01:14:07,820 --> 01:14:10,000
[Complete teamwork!]

1260
01:14:16,540 --> 01:14:18,770
Suk Jin... look at Suk Jin!

1261
01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:27,760
[Ninth Suk Jin almost caused big trouble!]

1262
01:14:30,620 --> 01:14:34,250
[Ah, Ji Hyo's entrance caused
the fumble.]

1263
01:14:36,990 --> 01:14:41,820
[Red Team's first attempt succeeds
at ten people!]

1264
01:14:41,990 --> 01:14:46,810
[But it's still amazing!
Nine people at first attempt!]

1265
01:14:46,810 --> 01:14:51,030
- You have to get closer to the front!
- Yeah, you guys have to go up more.

1266
01:14:51,030 --> 01:14:52,890
Everyone get closer to up front.

1267
01:14:52,900 --> 01:14:55,430
[Blue Team's second attempt!]

1268
01:15:00,750 --> 01:15:03,930
[Sufficiently chocked after seeing
the Red Team's performance.]

1269
01:15:03,930 --> 01:15:06,000
- Would you like to jump? I'll go in last.
- No, it's okay.

1270
01:15:07,480 --> 01:15:11,160
[Geun Young still feeling down after
the mistake she made earlier.]

1271
01:15:11,160 --> 01:15:13,130
- It's okay. Fighting!
- Fighting!

1272
01:15:13,130 --> 01:15:16,770
[Still watching Kwang Soo with
sharp eyes.]

1273
01:15:18,260 --> 01:15:21,000
[Blue Team's second attempt, Start!]

1274
01:15:21,710 --> 01:15:25,230
[Jae Suk is the first to enter again!]

1275
01:15:29,440 --> 01:15:31,870
[He's caught... is this how it ends?]

1276
01:15:34,630 --> 01:15:37,630
[Wow! A miraculous recovery!]

1277
01:15:41,900 --> 01:15:45,770
[With Jae Suk first, second
young boy enters without trouble.]

1278
01:15:45,770 --> 01:15:49,890
[Third and fourth with ease]

1279
01:15:49,900 --> 01:15:51,940
It's okay to go in with ease.

1280
01:15:51,940 --> 01:15:53,290
Kwang Soo is acting strange.

1281
01:15:55,150 --> 01:15:58,290
[Kwang Soo's turn to enter.]

1282
01:15:58,290 --> 01:16:01,080
[Stoic expression]

1283
01:16:04,060 --> 01:16:07,180
[Gritting their teeth to move as one.]

1284
01:16:07,910 --> 01:16:11,520
[At last, Geun Young's turn to enter.]

1285
01:16:17,020 --> 01:16:19,350
[Good job, Geun Young]

1286
01:16:20,090 --> 01:16:22,960
[Wow, seventh and eighth
entrance a success!]

1287
01:16:22,960 --> 01:16:24,640
[Now the ninth!]

1288
01:16:28,910 --> 01:16:32,820
[Ah... Blue Team's second attempt
succeeds at eight people.]

1289
01:16:34,950 --> 01:16:36,440
- How many people did we get in?
- We got a lot of people.

1290
01:16:36,440 --> 01:16:38,190
It's okay...

1291
01:16:38,190 --> 01:16:42,920
[Geun Young and the Blue Team
with big improvement.]

1292
01:16:45,790 --> 01:16:48,770
- It's not as easy as it looks, right?
- The rope was so short.

1293
01:16:48,770 --> 01:16:51,560
- What number were you? You were the ninth?
- Yes.

1294
01:16:53,790 --> 01:16:56,400
- We can do this.
- Yoo-ruce Willis!

1295
01:16:57,740 --> 01:17:03,640
[At the request,
each team's time to practice.]

1296
01:17:03,640 --> 01:17:05,310
We're going to practice
like it's the real thing.

1297
01:17:06,230 --> 01:17:09,720
[Blue Team's turn to practice first.]

1298
01:17:09,720 --> 01:17:11,330
<i>We're going to practice like
it's the real thing...</i>

1299
01:17:12,880 --> 01:17:16,030
[Seriously as if this was the real thing.]

1300
01:17:17,520 --> 01:17:20,480
[Already at four people within moments.]

1301
01:17:20,480 --> 01:17:22,640
[Five including Kwang Soo!]

1302
01:17:25,580 --> 01:17:26,920
With confidence! With confidence!

1303
01:17:29,300 --> 01:17:31,910
[Even Geun Young enters without trouble.]

1304
01:17:33,460 --> 01:17:37,050
[Nine people without a problem!]

1305
01:17:38,080 --> 01:17:41,030
[Tenth person!]

1306
01:17:41,030 --> 01:17:43,090
[Now eleventh!]

1307
01:17:43,090 --> 01:17:45,110
Why are they so good when it's
just practice?

1308
01:17:45,660 --> 01:17:47,390
That's awesome!

1309
01:17:48,480 --> 01:17:52,000
[Even though it's practice,
Blue Team has succeeded in 11 people!]

1310
01:17:54,610 --> 01:17:57,790
[Even the cool Dad succeeds in entering
as the twelfth man!]

1311
01:17:59,280 --> 01:18:02,420
[Awesome!
Even the thirteenth lady enters!]

1312
01:18:02,490 --> 01:18:04,670
[Just then!]

1313
01:18:04,670 --> 01:18:09,050
[Getting caught as the last
fourteenth person was making his entrance.]

1314
01:18:10,540 --> 01:18:14,600
[Even though it was only practice,
Blue Team succeeds in getting 13 people in!]

1315
01:18:14,600 --> 01:18:18,870
[At this rate, the victory is ours!]

1316
01:18:21,480 --> 01:18:23,890
Okay, here... everyone gather here.

1317
01:18:23,890 --> 01:18:26,970
The last person to come in just
get in wherever there's a blank spot.

1318
01:18:26,970 --> 01:18:30,070
- Just go in where there's space.
- You don't have to go to the back.

1319
01:18:30,070 --> 01:18:33,550
That's good, but it's important that
you guys scoot up as much as possible.

1320
01:18:33,550 --> 01:18:35,340
We will try to do that
but in case it doesn't happen

1321
01:18:35,340 --> 01:18:39,350
you don't have to go all the way to the
end like what happened to them.

1322
01:18:39,350 --> 01:18:41,960
So just go in wherever there's space.

1323
01:18:43,370 --> 01:18:45,310
- Are you okay?
- Yes, I'm fine.

1324
01:18:45,310 --> 01:18:47,270
You're really good!

1325
01:18:48,210 --> 01:18:50,720
[Blue Team with added confidence
after their practice.]

1326
01:18:52,460 --> 01:18:56,240
[Red Team's turn at their practice time.]

1327
01:19:00,930 --> 01:19:04,370
[Red Team's distinctive rush.]

1328
01:19:05,170 --> 01:19:09,310
[Practicing with members
overflowing with energy.]

1329
01:19:09,310 --> 01:19:12,320
[Numbers of members increasing
within moments.]

1330
01:19:13,230 --> 01:19:14,930
<i>Jump higher!</i>

1331
01:19:14,940 --> 01:19:17,590
[They're continuing to enter!]

1332
01:19:32,870 --> 01:19:36,890
[Red Team succeeds in getting 12
people in during their practice.]

1333
01:19:36,890 --> 01:19:39,990
They're rushing too much.
We're much better.

1334
01:19:39,990 --> 01:19:42,630
As long as Geun Young does a good job,
we can win this thing.

1335
01:19:43,490 --> 01:19:45,970
[I'm in trouble.]

1336
01:19:49,580 --> 01:19:52,590
[Red Team's second attempt.]

1337
01:19:52,590 --> 01:19:57,010
[Will they be able to do as well as
during their practice?]

1338
01:20:04,600 --> 01:20:07,500
[Number one, Ha Ha's entrance]

1339
01:20:07,500 --> 01:20:10,050
[The next one following right after!]

1340
01:20:10,050 --> 01:20:13,460
[Starting off the round with
their distinctive speed and flair!]

1341
01:20:14,370 --> 01:20:16,070
They really are so good!

1342
01:20:20,150 --> 01:20:22,750
[Eighth person succeeds in
making his entrance!]

1343
01:20:23,920 --> 01:20:27,770
[Even the Red Team's weak link,
Big nosed brother succeeds in entrance!]

1344
01:20:27,770 --> 01:20:28,870
Get in!

1345
01:20:32,800 --> 01:20:35,460
[The tenth person is Ace Ji Hyo!]

1346
01:20:35,670 --> 01:20:38,360
[10 people within moments!]

1347
01:20:43,230 --> 01:20:47,530
[Gets caught when Ji Hyo makes
her entrance.]

1348
01:20:57,980 --> 01:21:02,620
[Coach Kook encouraging his teammates
after their opportunity is over.]

1349
01:21:05,440 --> 01:21:10,780
[Blue Team's third and last attempt.]

1350
01:21:10,780 --> 01:21:12,080
<i>If by any chance...</i>

1351
01:21:12,080 --> 01:21:14,300
<i>We got more people
than them during our practice.</i>

1352
01:21:14,300 --> 01:21:17,020
<i>The other team succeeded in
getting in ten people...</i>

1353
01:21:18,110 --> 01:21:25,570
[If they don't break the opposing team's
record of 10, Red Team immediately wins!]

1354
01:21:25,570 --> 01:21:28,970
I know this is difficult, but everyone
relax and do their best!

1355
01:21:30,310 --> 01:21:34,100
I hope that you all think of this as a fun
jump roping game and do it with comfort.

1356
01:21:34,950 --> 01:21:37,630
[With more vigor than any other time.]

1357
01:21:38,840 --> 01:21:41,360
Everyone do the wave! The wave!

1358
01:21:43,820 --> 01:21:45,460
One, two, three!

1359
01:21:55,080 --> 01:21:58,360
[He really likes doing things like that...]

1360
01:21:59,500 --> 01:22:04,170
[It's a relief that
the crowd seems to like it too.]

1361
01:22:10,930 --> 01:22:12,450
Do you think that's a special mission?

1362
01:22:13,100 --> 01:22:16,660
[Is that X-man's special mission?]

1363
01:22:23,100 --> 01:22:26,460
[After doing that lap,
he's already drained of energy?]

1364
01:22:30,310 --> 01:22:33,780
[If the Blue Team fails to get in 10 people,
then it's the Red Team's victory!]

1365
01:22:33,790 --> 01:22:37,800
[Blue Team's chance to get everyone in!]

1366
01:22:38,740 --> 01:22:41,070
- Fighting!
- Fighting!

1367
01:22:44,540 --> 01:22:45,700
I'm getting nervous.

1368
01:22:52,930 --> 01:22:56,240
[Entering with caution.]

1369
01:23:05,970 --> 01:23:08,820
[Number five, Kwang Soo...]

1370
01:23:08,820 --> 01:23:12,120
[Number six, a member
of the crowd also enters.]

1371
01:23:14,240 --> 01:23:16,380
[Number seven Geun Young,
this time?]

1372
01:23:17,750 --> 01:23:20,210
[She made it!]

1373
01:23:20,210 --> 01:23:24,140
[In this moment, everyone is as one...]

1374
01:23:34,040 --> 01:23:36,360
[That's too bad!]

1375
01:23:36,360 --> 01:23:39,840
[Fails with the ninth person's entrance.]

1376
01:23:40,380 --> 01:23:43,760
[The victory goes to the Red Team
with their 10 people!]

1377
01:23:53,440 --> 01:23:56,600
[To everyone that's helped out,
we sincerely thank you.]

1378
01:23:57,320 --> 01:24:02,100
[The only thing left now...
is the final judgment.]

1379
01:24:03,370 --> 01:24:07,260
[Just who is X-man?]

1380
01:24:07,260 --> 01:24:08,380
<i>Jump roping with the crowd is
really fun.</i>

1381
01:24:08,380 --> 01:24:10,710
We did it a few times in the past,
and it's really fun.

1382
01:24:10,710 --> 01:24:11,710
It's much harder than I thought.

1383
01:24:11,720 --> 01:24:14,900
I don't think there's anyone who
purposely made a mistake or anything.

1384
01:24:14,900 --> 01:24:17,210
- How can anyone have done that?
- Yes, there was.

1385
01:24:17,210 --> 01:24:18,680
- Really?
- Who?

1386
01:24:18,680 --> 01:24:20,930
Is it the person I'm thinking of?

1387
01:24:24,970 --> 01:24:29,220
- But if really isn't Kwang Soo...
- If it isn't him...

1388
01:24:29,220 --> 01:24:32,380
Then it means that Kwang Soo
really is bad at things.

1389
01:24:33,550 --> 01:24:37,470
Geun Young... who's the person that's been
acting the friendliest with you today?

1390
01:24:38,420 --> 01:24:40,020
Kwang Soo...

1391
01:24:41,470 --> 01:24:47,860
[Casting all suspicion on him thinking that
X-man's mission is to get close to Geun Young.]

1392
01:24:47,860 --> 01:24:52,320
[While Kwang Soo is
getting suspected more and more...]

1393
01:24:52,330 --> 01:24:55,050
You could've been luring her or something...

1394
01:24:55,880 --> 01:25:00,170
[The bus that they're all on is
taking them to the final place of judgment.]

1395
01:25:02,290 --> 01:25:07,430
[Arrives at the X-man's
final place of judgment, Youngjongdo.]

1396
01:25:07,430 --> 01:25:09,750
- It looks like the X-man set!
- Yeah, it does look like it.

1397
01:25:11,230 --> 01:25:14,310
[This is the final judgment stage!]

1398
01:25:14,310 --> 01:25:16,620
Why don't you give us a hint?

1399
01:25:16,620 --> 01:25:18,720
I wish we could get a hint too.

1400
01:25:18,720 --> 01:25:20,990
- What?
- I want to get a hint too.

1401
01:25:20,990 --> 01:25:23,300
More than anything else, the team
I've been on lost every game today.

1402
01:25:23,300 --> 01:25:26,330
[It was the definitive hint to reveal
who the X-man really is...]

1403
01:25:26,340 --> 01:25:28,870
- I think this is important.
- Come on, let's take it and see.

1404
01:25:29,870 --> 01:25:32,290
[Running so they could see
for themselves alone.]

1405
01:25:33,640 --> 01:25:35,320
What do they take us for?

1406
01:25:43,470 --> 01:25:46,350
Why don't you show it to us too?
We won't say anything.

1407
01:25:46,350 --> 01:25:48,210
Just tell us what the hint says.

1408
01:25:48,210 --> 01:25:49,600
We haven't even won anything today...

1409
01:25:49,600 --> 01:25:52,140
- It's initials.
- Tell us what the initial says.

1410
01:25:52,140 --> 01:25:53,880
- What's the initials?
- Want me to tell you what it is?

1411
01:25:54,230 --> 01:25:57,280
[Since they don't know anyways,
sharing it would be...]

1412
01:25:57,280 --> 01:25:59,350
- DB...
- What is DB?

1413
01:26:00,230 --> 01:26:01,450
- What is DB?
- What's that?

1414
01:26:01,450 --> 01:26:04,190
- What does that stand for?
- Dae Bak (Awesome).

1415
01:26:07,950 --> 01:26:09,940
Who's the person that hit it big recently?

1416
01:26:10,610 --> 01:26:11,910
The name of your group is...

1417
01:26:13,050 --> 01:26:17,060
[It's Turbo, not Durbo...]

1418
01:26:17,060 --> 01:26:18,360
- Did you think it was Durbo?
- I thought that maybe...

1419
01:26:18,960 --> 01:26:22,220
[Without knowing what the hint is,
trading their suspect first...]

1420
01:26:22,220 --> 01:26:25,900
[The team with X-man on their side during
the final judgment loses.]

1421
01:26:25,900 --> 01:26:28,260
- Who are you going to trade?
- How about Gary?

1422
01:26:28,260 --> 01:26:31,070
Why? I could be X-man too.

1423
01:26:31,070 --> 01:26:33,900
- I don't think it's me.
- I'm X-man!

1424
01:26:33,900 --> 01:26:35,040
I'm X-man too.

1425
01:26:35,040 --> 01:26:36,570
I know you are...

1426
01:26:38,380 --> 01:26:41,850
[If they pick the wrong person,
they could bring X-man to their side...]

1427
01:26:41,860 --> 01:26:43,220
Hold!

1428
01:26:43,220 --> 01:26:46,500
[No change in team members.]

1429
01:26:46,500 --> 01:26:48,460
- What are the hints that you've received?
- Moon Geun Young and DB.

1430
01:26:48,460 --> 01:26:49,830
<i>Moon Geun Young hint meant...</i>

1431
01:26:49,830 --> 01:26:57,230
<i>for the X-man to be on the same team as
Moon Geun Young at the final location.</i>

1432
01:26:58,300 --> 01:27:03,670
[If X-man is on the Blue Team,
it'll be X-man's sole victory!]

1433
01:27:03,670 --> 01:27:07,550
[For now, the main suspect Kwang Soo and
Geun Young are on the same team!]

1434
01:27:09,110 --> 01:27:11,660
[Blue Team ascending to the
judgment stand.]

1435
01:27:11,670 --> 01:27:15,770
[If Kwang Soo really is X-man,
it will be his sole victory.]

1436
01:27:23,870 --> 01:27:30,780
[Kwang Soo, who's received a lot of suspicion
from everyone from the beginning.]

1437
01:27:33,800 --> 01:27:38,010
[The fact that he's been defeated in almost
every game is a given.]

1438
01:27:38,020 --> 01:27:43,240
[With plenty of action that can
earn him the suspicion he's received...]

1439
01:27:43,240 --> 01:27:45,640
<i>It really isn't me!
I'm not the one!</i>

1440
01:27:45,650 --> 01:27:50,730
[Could he... really be X-man?]

1441
01:27:54,070 --> 01:27:56,090
[Not a match.]

1442
01:27:56,090 --> 01:28:01,220
[Kwang Soo isn't the X-man!]

1443
01:28:01,220 --> 01:28:02,660
I told you that I wasn't all day!

1444
01:28:02,660 --> 01:28:04,760
Hey... it's not you?

1445
01:28:05,270 --> 01:28:07,290
I told you that it isn't me!
I've been telling you that all day.

1446
01:28:07,290 --> 01:28:09,220
The reason why I'm positive
that X-man isn't here

1447
01:28:09,220 --> 01:28:11,360
is because if X-man was here, then
he would've tried to go to the other team.

1448
01:28:11,360 --> 01:28:12,680
I'm sure you're right.

1449
01:28:12,680 --> 01:28:14,460
Then is it Kang Gary?

1450
01:28:14,460 --> 01:28:16,670
[Then... Kang Gary?]

1451
01:28:19,260 --> 01:28:21,120
X-man!

1452
01:28:21,930 --> 01:28:27,090
[With his peaceful expression...
could he be carrying out a mission?]

1453
01:28:28,750 --> 01:28:33,400
[Now that we think about it,
no one has ever suspected him today...]

1454
01:28:33,400 --> 01:28:39,030
[Could he have used his casualness as a
weapon to be on the same team as Geun Young?]

1455
01:28:47,350 --> 01:28:49,120
[Not a match.]

1456
01:28:49,120 --> 01:28:52,410
[Gary's not the X-man either!]

1457
01:28:52,410 --> 01:28:54,950
If it's not Jae Suk,
then it's one of your members.

1458
01:28:54,960 --> 01:28:57,980
Then we win, right?
If it's not you, then we win?

1459
01:28:57,980 --> 01:29:01,000
- That's right...
- If it's not Jae Suk, then our team wins!

1460
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:03,700
X-man wouldn't have succeeded
either then.

1461
01:29:03,700 --> 01:29:09,610
[But if Jae Suk is X-man,
then he would win all by himself.]

1462
01:29:09,610 --> 01:29:11,670
Please, please... Please, Jae Suk!

1463
01:29:12,920 --> 01:29:16,130
[Could he be X-man?]

1464
01:29:23,120 --> 01:29:30,260
[Defeated in almost every game...]

1465
01:29:30,260 --> 01:29:34,660
[Jae Suk, whom Ace Ji Hyo has been
suspicious of all day...]

1466
01:29:35,850 --> 01:29:38,740
[Could he possibly be?]

1467
01:29:41,730 --> 01:29:42,830
[Match!]

1468
01:29:44,330 --> 01:29:49,470
[X-man is Yoo Jae Suk!]

1469
01:29:56,470 --> 01:29:59,790
Forget it!

1470
01:29:59,910 --> 01:30:04,180
[How can this be... Jae Suk is X-man...]

1471
01:30:04,190 --> 01:30:06,620
[Confirmed, Jae Suk is X-man.]

1472
01:30:07,390 --> 01:30:13,100
<i>[You are... X-man for the day.]</i>

1473
01:30:13,100 --> 01:30:15,670
[You are X-man.]

1474
01:30:15,670 --> 01:30:19,780
<i>You have to be on the same team as Geun
Young at the final judgment for you to win.</i>

1475
01:30:22,200 --> 01:30:24,830
[Acting as X-man
starting with the first event.]

1476
01:30:24,830 --> 01:30:27,030
[Turning his back towards her...]

1477
01:30:32,730 --> 01:30:36,400
[Even during the corn game
that he suggested himself...]

1478
01:30:37,540 --> 01:30:40,270
[He purposely threw a kernel of corn
off the plate.]

1479
01:30:42,620 --> 01:30:45,150
[Purposely acting disappointed at
having lost.]

1480
01:30:45,150 --> 01:30:47,500
<i>Trade Dong Hoon for Jae Suk.</i>

1481
01:30:47,980 --> 01:30:51,080
[This is how he came to be
on the same team as Geun Young!]

1482
01:30:51,080 --> 01:30:53,330
<i>Every team that I join keeps losing.</i>

1483
01:30:53,340 --> 01:30:55,360
<i>I think it's Jae Suk...</i>

1484
01:30:55,370 --> 01:30:58,630
<i>No, it's not him.
He'd be obvious about it.</i>

1485
01:30:59,540 --> 01:31:01,730
[Hint to the identity of X-man, DB.]

1486
01:31:01,730 --> 01:31:03,710
[If looked on the keyboard, 'D' equals 'o']

1487
01:31:03,720 --> 01:31:05,640
[And 'B' Equals 'y']

1488
01:31:05,890 --> 01:31:08,420
[Those put together equals 'Yoo'.]

1489
01:31:08,420 --> 01:31:14,200
<i>[You are... X-man.]</i>

1490
01:31:14,200 --> 01:31:18,540
[And that's how he succeeded his roll
and mission as X-man.]

1491
01:31:19,750 --> 01:31:23,040
Kwang Soo did such a great job being
the patsy for X-man...

1492
01:31:23,040 --> 01:31:26,470
Anyway... the gold is all mine!
