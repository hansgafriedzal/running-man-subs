- What's with your hat?

170
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:47,170
- Can't you tell?
- Why is an agent wearing a hat?

171
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:50,820
- Then why are you wearing sunglasses?
- Agents wear sunglasses.

172
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:53,410
Seriously... what the heck?

173
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:54,740

secret agent watch.]

Where are you going?

176
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,760
- I just stopped by for something.
- Stopped by where?

177
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:04,610
I'm just stopping by here for a minute.

178
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:06,610
- Why?
- Why are you asking?

179
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:09,440
I had some business here.
Go about your business then.

180
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,310

181

[Rushing to get his information!]

182
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:19,370
This is the same intersection where we had
the water gun fight with MBLAQ previously.

183

I'm 001.

184

Thank you for all your hard work.

185
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:30,090
I see that your hands are really chapped.
I think you need some lotion on your hands.

186
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:37,600
[If you go to the end of this road,
you'll be able to meet your informant!]

187

[Attack of the ladies!]

of seeing him.]

195

- Where are you going?
- Why are you going back?

196
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,950
- What? I have something to take care of...
- Why are you leaving?

197
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:32,800
- Wait... where are you going?
- I have to do something...

198

[The truth of the streets that he's been
made aware of thanks to Agent Kkuk.]

199

- How do I get there?
- You can go this way.

200
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,000
- Down that way?
- Yes.

201
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,240
[Only way is to go through the street...]

202
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:47,470
Why do you keep following me around?

203
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:50,990
When the ladies have their hands on him,
I'll use that moment to sneak through.

204
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:57,070
I have a feeling... he'll take the moment
to sneak by when I'm caught.

205
00:12:57,070 --> 00:12:59,200
I'm going to run by them like the wind.

206
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:04,000
Look at him up there...
Look at the way he's walking.

207
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,620
Even the way he walks...

208
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:13,330
[Nearing where the ladies are
lying in wait.]

209
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:14,830
Wait, wait...

210

[I'm to get to the end of this
street, right?]

211
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:26,240

[Agent Jae Suk making a move]

213

be grabbed.]

[Using the moment to run by
like the wind!]

218
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:03,460

could be up there.

[Shin Hye being suspicious of
all the dogs in the area]

343
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:21,180
You're so cute!

344
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:25,580
I feel like you're a hint too.
Do you have anything?

345
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:29,620
- What's the dog's name?
- Gary.

346
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:31,520
Gary...

347
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,640
Gary, stand up.

348
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:36,820
Oh my goodness!

349
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:40,160
[Being startled by real Gary's prank.]

350
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:42,180
What are you doing here?

351
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:43,630
- Did you find anything?
- Did you find it?

352
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:45,490
No, I haven't found anything yet.

353
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:47,600
Paw.

354
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:51,890
It's not the time right now for you
to be playing with dogs.

355
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:55,120
But he could be the hint.

356
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,700
Oh, really?

357
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:58,800
Let's see... shake.

358
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,560
[Concentrating on searching the dogs...]

359
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:01,990
Come here.

360
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:04,880
Okay.

361
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:10,650
Don't be like this because you look like
Jolie in 'You're Beautiful'.

362
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:17,880
[A phone number written on a tag
on the dogs collar!]

363
00:24:22,850 --> 00:24:24,410
Did you find something?
Did you find something?

364
00:24:24,410 --> 00:24:26,540
- Wait...
- Why?

365
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:30,140
[Agent Shin Hye having found
a phone number for the hint!]

366
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:33,350
Should we call?
Let's call with your phone.

367
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:36,390
[Agent Gary sidling up to naive Shin Hye
in order to gain the information.]

368
00:24:36,390 --> 00:24:38,310
I won't forget this favor.

369
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:40,720
If... if I get a hint.

370
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,530
- What the heck?
- Why?

371
00:24:42,530 --> 00:24:43,900
It was a dud.

372
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:46,970
[That was a dud?]

373
00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:49,450
Then it really must be on
the collar of one of the dogs.

374
00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:52,480
Maybe?
[I didn't call...]

375
00:24:52,970 --> 00:24:56,390
[Wow! Agent Shin Hye only
pretended to call!]

376
00:24:56,390 --> 00:24:59,710
- Gary, I'm going to search down below.
- Okay.

377
00:25:01,010 --> 00:25:05,820
[Shin Hye heading down below
to avoid Gary to make her call.]

378
00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:08,460
[Making the real phone call.]

379
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:09,970
It's ringing...

380
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:14,830
[The number worked!]

381
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:16,100
Hello?

382
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:17,750
<i>Hello?</i>

383
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,550
Yes.

384
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:23,180
<i>Agent 007 has something important.</i>

385
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:26,060
Agent 007 has something important?

386
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:30,750
<i>Agent 007 has something important.</i>

387
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:34,380
[Agent 007?]

388
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:35,690
I understand. Thank you.

389
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:47,710
[Agent Shin Hye succeeds in gaining
the information at Hongdae Steps.]

390
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:50,850
Are you hiding something?
Say ah... is it in your mouth?

391
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:54,860
Why are you being like this?
We're both Gary's.

392
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:57,240
Stop being coy and tell me what it is.

393
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,940
[Shin Hye walking way down below
to avoid Gary's watchful eyes.]

394
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:05,680
I think that Agent 007...
has an important piece of information.

395
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:07,270
[Who is Agent 007? And what
is the important something?]

396
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:09,120
Who is Agent 007?

397
00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:14,500
[It's this guy...]

398
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:18,660
[He's said to have something important...]

399
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:21,220
[Ah, so sleepy...]

400
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:26,360
[Agent 007 has something important.]

401
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:28,730
This isn't going to be easy.

402
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:30,460
We're in big trouble.

403
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,150
- Then...
- Yes?

404
00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:35,060
- Jong Kook...
- Yes?

405
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:37,920
Let's work together.
We can share the information.

406
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:40,360
One person can be the bait...

407
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:43,360
and the other person can get
the information and we can share it.

408
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,400
[I got you...]

409
00:26:47,770 --> 00:26:50,620
[Rushing in on bicycles!]

410
00:26:52,630 --> 00:26:54,860
- We're in trouble.
- We're in trouble.

411
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:56,500
[Steeper than they had imagined.]

412
00:26:57,860 --> 00:27:00,020
[The ladies' lair]

413
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:07,350
[When did they get past us?]

414
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,500
We have to be prepared.

415
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:13,260
[Second obstacle. Where
the men in athletic gear awaits.]

416
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:15,220
This isn't going to work.

417
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:24,540
[If they slow down at all,
they'll be caught!]

418
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:30,390
[Mr. Capable and Jae Suk having bypassed
both obstacles at lightening speed!]

419
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:35,680
[However...]

420
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:41,810
[This is... the third obstacle,
a mob of young girls!]

421
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:48,060
[Ultimately getting surrounded by
a mob of girls and the group of men...]

422
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:53,450
[Will this be the end of their attempt?]

423
00:27:57,330 --> 00:28:00,930
[Agent Kkuk, rushing in head first!]

424
00:28:05,610 --> 00:28:07,170
The flag!

425
00:28:07,170 --> 00:28:08,490
Where's the flag?

426
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:11,990
[Please succeed...]

427
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:19,560
[A flag on top of the flower pot!]

428
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:25,650
[Agent Kkuk succeeds in obtaining the flag!]

429
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,980
Kim Jong Kook, Kim Jong Kook...

430
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:35,020
Kim Jong Kook, go get him.

431
00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:39,220
[Meeting the informant at last.]

432
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:40,930
Thank you.

433
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:46,970
[Being handed the information.]

434
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:51,950
That was exhausting...

435
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:55,880
The answer is hidden inside the word.

436
00:28:56,370 --> 00:28:58,680
This is it? This is all there is?

437
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:02,320
[The answer is hidden inside
the word.]

438
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:07,780
[The answer is hidden inside the word.]

439
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:10,250
- Did you find it?
- I thought I was going to die.

440
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:11,980
- I'm serious.
- Tell me what it is.

441
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:14,560
- What did you say?
- You have to tell me what it is.

442
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:15,820
Share the information?

443
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:19,960
You were able to get it only because
I allowed myself to get caught.

444
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,340
- You're saying you sacrificed yourself?
- Of course.

445
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:26,050
- I was chased down too.
- I threw myself in the crowd.

446
00:29:26,050 --> 00:29:28,360
- When did you do that?
- I threw myself in there!

447
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:31,800
Like a moth that flies towards the flame,
I threw myself in that chaos.

448
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:36,530
- That's the only reason you succeeded.
- You really have a way of twisting the truth.

449
00:29:36,530 --> 00:29:40,650
Fine then. I'll have to go on my own
to find out the information.

450
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:45,430
Hey... in that case...

451
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:48,250
I'll tell you what it is,
but give me your bike.

452
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:50,610
Okay. Let's cooperate here.

453
00:29:50,610 --> 00:29:53,450
The answer... is within the word.

454
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:56,710
- What's that supposed to mean?
- That's what I'm saying.

455
00:29:56,710 --> 00:29:59,640
- What does 'Answer is within a word' mean?
- That's why I'm really mad right now too!

456
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,940
Can't you see that I'm mad right now?

457
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:05,480
- But you're always angry!
- I'm more angry than usual right now.

458
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:09,400
That's not the complete hint.
What is the word then?

459
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,870
- That's all it said! How would I know?
- What's the word then?

460
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:14,680
How do I know what the word is?
That's all I was told.

461
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,940
- What kind of information is that?
- What did you say?

462
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:18,980
- What kind of an information?
- That's no information!

463
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:21,090
That's the information I was given!

464
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:23,670
Thank you.

465
00:30:23,670 --> 00:30:26,150
[007 Seung Gi arrives]

466
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:29,630
- We had a cup of tea.
- Jae Suk...

467
00:30:29,630 --> 00:30:31,280
- Seung Gi!
- Hello.

468
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:33,030
- Hello.
- He came here?

469
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:34,590
We're in trouble.

470
00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:37,760
- What? What we're you two just scheming?
- We didn't scheme anything.

471
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,560
You just schemed something, didn't you?

472
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:42,950
[Not being coherent with his words
once he sees Seung Gi...]

473
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:45,740
- Good luck.
- Did you have any breakfast?

474
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:48,550
- Excuse me? Breakfast?
- Did you not have any breakfast?

475
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:50,760
- No, I didn't have any breakfast.
- Then have yourself a nice warm cup of tea.

476
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:56,320
- What's going on?
- Will you be alright?

477
00:30:56,930 --> 00:30:59,050
- What...
- Just get going.

478
00:30:59,050 --> 00:31:01,620
[Feeling sorry for him from knowing
what's about to head his way...]

479
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:03,660
- Is something going to happen in there?
- No, it's not like that.

480
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:05,250
Just order yourself something
nice and warm.

481
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:08,770
I'm sorry for making you suffer so much when
I haven't seen you so long on a variety show.

482
00:31:08,770 --> 00:31:11,740
- Why are you apologizing to me already?
- No, no...

483
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:13,080
Just go have a cup of tea, Seung Gi.

484
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:14,600
Did you find any information?

485
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:18,890
So you have.

486
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:24,040
[Agent Seung Gi being a little
too obvious...]

487
00:31:24,050 --> 00:31:25,650
- Can't fool you.
- Seung Gi...

488
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:27,920
- Seung Gi, we're heading out.
- Yes, I'll see you later.

489
00:31:27,930 --> 00:31:29,260
What do we do about him?

490
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:32,610
- I feel so bad for Seung Gi.
- He needs to go through the experience.

491
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:35,830
[Pitying the little brother who's
about to face some big trouble.]

492
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:39,260
Down to the end of the street?

493
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:41,960
[Seung Gi with the mission in hand.]

494
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:46,910
End where? Where is the end?

495
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:49,640
[To the end of that street?]

496
00:31:54,170 --> 00:31:56,800
- But anyways, Seung Gi...
- I can hear the sound.

497
00:31:57,890 --> 00:32:01,370
[Trouble is already well under way...]

498
00:32:07,950 --> 00:32:10,860
[Making an escape for now!]

499
00:32:12,650 --> 00:32:16,550
I'm sure he's really shocked, right?
At least we've experienced it before.

500
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:21,870
And I noticed that a few of those ladies
really likes to stroke the face.

501
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:27,030
[Stroking his face to heart's content...]

502
00:32:39,050 --> 00:32:44,370
[So this is why they were
so worried...]

503
00:32:44,370 --> 00:32:46,490
I should've had a nice warm cup of tea
before I started running.

504
00:32:48,910 --> 00:32:51,630
[Gary also arriving at the same place.]

505
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:53,380
- Did you find anything?
- What?

506
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:56,630
- Did you find anything?
- Gary... are you in good condition today?

507
00:32:56,630 --> 00:32:57,720
Why?

508
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,480
You have to be
physically fit for this mission.

509
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:02,770
- If you go down to the end...
- It's chaos?

510
00:33:02,770 --> 00:33:04,860
[Will the secrets of this place
be revealed so easily?]

511
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:07,020
- Amazing prize is waiting for you.
- Really?

512
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:08,980
- You're really going to be surprised.
- Were you the first one here?

513
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:10,840
Yes, I'm the first.
- Really?

514
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:13,880
I want to cheer you on, so...
- Seung Gi...

515
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:15,870
I don't know what may happen,
so I'll follow behind you.

516
00:33:15,870 --> 00:33:17,630
- Is it that crazy?
- Just in case...

517
00:33:17,630 --> 00:33:19,490
- You just have to be fit.
- Fit?

518
00:33:19,490 --> 00:33:21,820
- Both your legs and upper body is healthy?
- Yes.

519
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:23,360
Then you're fine. Go.

520
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:27,030
- If you need anything, just call for me.
- Okay, Seung Gi. I'll be back.

521
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:28,480
Thanks, Seung Gi!

522

without any notice.]

nowhere to escape to!]

[Gary succeeds in getting away
by using this break?]

546
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:20,220
You deserve it!

547
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:22,460
You deserve it, Lee Seung Gi!

548
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:34,190
[Now all he needs to do is get the flag!]

549
00:35:47,650 --> 00:35:51,030
[Huh? He's just passing by it?]

550
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:59,500
[Why does Gary have to revert to
being by himself again at this time?]

551
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:02,970
[He sure is... going far.]

552
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,070
Enough...

553
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,010
Gary!

554

Where is it?

555
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,850
I've been totally had.

556
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:25,710
I've been totally had...

557
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:27,450
Hello.

[The flag is still...]

559

Isn't this the flag?

560
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:39,990
This is the flag, isn't it?

561
00:36:43,590 --> 00:36:45,280
Didn't Gary already pass by here?

562
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:48,880
[He passed by quite a while ago...]

563
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:55,820
[With flag in hand,
he enters to meet the informant.]

564

- Hello.
- Oh my! Hello.

565
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:04,020
- Did Kang Gary stop by here?
- We haven't seen him.

566
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:06,190
He beat me here though...

567
00:37:07,570 --> 00:37:09,870
[Where is the flag?]

in getting the information.]

[Agent Gary one step too late.]

570
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:27,520
I know you have another one!
Give it to me too!

571
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:30,260
- I'll see you later.
- What do you mean, see you later?

572
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:32,060
Hey! Lee Seung Gi!

573
00:37:33,950 --> 00:37:36,960
[Lucky to gain the hint thanks to
Gary's tendency to go blindly forward.]

574
00:37:37,850 --> 00:37:39,770
The answer is within the word...

575
00:37:39,770 --> 00:37:43,330
[The answer is within the word.]

576
00:37:48,730 --> 00:37:51,050
The hint in Sang Ahm is sold out...

577

[But I haven't gotten a single
piece of information yet...]

578

[Agent Shin Hye arriving at
the loach soup restaurant.]

579
00:38:08,290 --> 00:38:10,850
This is exhausting!
I can smell something delicious in here!

580

the car! There's only one real car key!]

[Open the car door
and rescue the genie!]

584

Where's the key?

585
00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:36,730
- Can I open it?
- Yes.

586
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:48,250
[Countless number of loaches
inside the tank.]

587
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:51,180
[And inside are countless number of keys!]

588

- With my bare hands?
- Yes.

frightened...]

[She got one!]

[Checking to see if it's the real car key!]

593
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:33,520
Is this not the car?
Are you sure this is the one?

594
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:35,000
[It's not opening]

595
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,850
This isn't the one!

596
00:39:43,810 --> 00:39:46,620
[The terror having already disappeared
with the mission in front of her.]

597
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:50,050
This one isn't even going in.

598
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:52,250
Seriously...

599

countless number of times...]

You guys have to stop doing this to me.

602

- You're so pretty!
- Thank you!

to the next location.]

without hesitation now.]

00:42:26,930 --> 00:42:31,390
What is all this for?
First our mission is to stop the bomb.

627
00:42:31,390 --> 00:42:34,050
- That's right.
- Can't we stop it by all working together?

628
00:42:35,570 --> 00:42:39,360
[But... that's true...
They could all just work together...]

arrived at the loach soup restaurant.]

Can we take a look?

638

Do loaches bite?

639
00:43:17,150 --> 00:43:20,080
It's people that eat the loaches,
but the loaches don't bite.

640

- Ji Hyo...
- Yes?

Or we can just all share our
information.

845
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:41,360
It's Kim Jong Kook and Lee Kwang Soo!
Let's get out there!

846
00:56:41,360 --> 00:56:43,020
Let's get out there!

847
00:56:51,410 --> 00:56:56,690
[Why is Mr. Capable all of a sudden
ripping off Kwang Soo's name tag?]

848
00:56:56,690 --> 00:57:00,040
[Could... he be?]

849
00:57:00,040 --> 00:57:01,430
Come here.

850
00:57:01,430 --> 00:57:03,310
I said, come here. Stay still.

851
00:57:03,310 --> 00:57:04,500
Stay here.
You can't be seen by others.

852
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:06,700
Stay here. Don't move.

853
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:18,730
<i>[Lee Kwang Soo, out!
Lee Kwang Soo, out!]</i>

854
00:57:18,730 --> 00:57:20,130
Lee Kwang Soo, out?

855
00:57:20,970 --> 00:57:22,190
See? It's already begun.

856
00:57:22,190 --> 00:57:24,790
You and I've been together,
and neither one of us did it.

857
00:57:24,790 --> 00:57:27,010
I'm not the villain!

858
00:57:28,290 --> 00:57:35,130
[The enemy within... is Kim Jong Kook!]

859
00:57:35,130 --> 00:57:39,650
[How is it that he became the
enemy within?]

860
00:57:42,220 --> 00:57:44,450
[Earlier this morning]

861
00:57:44,450 --> 00:57:46,460
<i>Great job yesterday.</i>

862
00:57:46,470 --> 00:57:50,560
<i>But unfortunately, you didn't pass the
mission for the License to Oust.</i>

863
00:57:51,110 --> 00:57:54,790
<i>It's because you received the
lowest score during the mission.</i>

864
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:58,650
<i>Though I'm disappointed that
we won't do work together...</i>

865
00:57:58,650 --> 00:58:01,220
<i>the world of secret agents
is a cruel one.</i>

866
00:58:01,220 --> 00:58:04,440
<i>I'm sorry. Goodbye.</i>

867
00:58:07,300 --> 00:58:12,200
[Mr. Capable wasn't able to become
a 00 agent.]

868
00:58:12,210 --> 00:58:15,350
[Just then...]

869
00:58:15,350 --> 00:58:19,720
[A special delivery was made
even to him...]

870
00:58:23,250 --> 00:58:25,720
[A mysterious letter was sent to him...]

871
00:58:28,940 --> 00:58:31,670
<i>How does it feel to have been
disqualified?</i>

872
00:58:31,670 --> 00:58:36,330
<i>I will now give you a chance to get your
revenge on MI6 for disqualifying you.</i>

873
00:58:36,330 --> 00:58:39,700
[A chance to get revenge?]

874
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:43,040
[In an attempt to get monopoly on
the gold market...]

875
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:47,170
[someone is planning on setting off
a bomb in the gold vault at the Prism Tower.]

876
00:58:47,180 --> 00:58:52,640
[MI6 agents will be sent to
stop the attempt at the attack...]

877
00:58:53,480 --> 00:59:02,170
[Infiltrate the group of agents by
wearing the uniform that's been sent to you.]

878
00:59:02,930 --> 00:59:10,450
[After stopping the attack on the gold vault,
steal the gold bars in secret!]

879
00:59:12,290 --> 00:59:14,930
It would be an advantage to you
to do better than the last time.

880
00:59:14,930 --> 00:59:16,410
I have all my faith in you.

881
00:59:19,780 --> 00:59:21,980
Just who in the world sent this to me?

882
00:59:23,170 --> 00:59:26,360
If it wasn't M...
then there's someone else?

883
00:59:30,410 --> 00:59:32,030
Anyway...

884
00:59:32,030 --> 00:59:35,600
you're going to come to regret...
disqualifying me.

885
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:37,980
M... you just wait.

886
00:59:37,990 --> 00:59:43,530
[This is how he became the villain
that we were unaware of.]

887
00:59:44,870 --> 00:59:47,590
[In order to get to the gold bars first...]

888
00:59:47,590 --> 00:59:53,160
[He must find the hints to dismantle
the bombs before the agents!]

889
00:59:54,300 --> 00:59:57,430
[And...]

890
00:59:57,430 --> 01:00:04,820
[Just who is the one that
handed me the evil mission?]

891
01:00:19,700 --> 01:00:22,270
[This is...]

892
01:00:22,270 --> 01:00:26,140
[A time bomb!]

893
01:00:27,330 --> 01:00:33,680
[This is the explosive device that's
posing a threat to the gold vault!]

894
01:00:38,340 --> 01:00:41,020
[In order to get to the bomb...]

895
01:00:41,020 --> 01:00:50,020
[This lock needs to be unlocked!]

896
01:00:53,080 --> 01:00:57,590
[I don't care if it blows up or not...]

897
01:00:57,590 --> 01:01:01,710
[Mom, Jong Kook tore my name tag
off again...]

898
01:01:04,090 --> 01:01:05,890
I feel like it's in here somewhere.

899
01:01:08,990 --> 01:01:13,120
[Agent 001 working hard to
find the clues.]

900
01:01:15,940 --> 01:01:17,580
This place is huge.

901
01:01:24,180 --> 01:01:25,800
Quiet, quiet, quiet...

902
01:01:28,980 --> 01:01:31,420
Look around the surroundings.
Gwon Yeol...

903
01:01:31,420 --> 01:01:35,090
Take a good look around.
Is anyone here? Anyone watching me?

904
01:01:35,090 --> 01:01:38,090
[After taking a look around to
make sure that no one is watching...]

905
01:01:42,980 --> 01:01:45,620
[Agent 001 discovers a box
containing a clue!]

906
01:01:47,030 --> 01:01:50,740
[A car looking thing inside the box...]

907
01:01:53,410 --> 01:01:58,870
[This is a USB storage device!]

908
01:02:25,300 --> 01:02:29,510
[An extremely cautious Agent 001.]

909
01:02:30,730 --> 01:02:33,360
What the heck... this is nerve wrecking.

910
01:02:55,290 --> 01:02:58,100
[Finally getting it connected to
the computer.]

911
01:03:01,650 --> 01:03:02,800
Hint!

912
01:03:11,300 --> 01:03:14,300
[Giraffe?]

913
01:03:15,790 --> 01:03:16,940
Giraffe!

914
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:20,470
But Kwang Soo's been ousted.

915
01:03:22,780 --> 01:03:28,170
[Now that he thinks about it, the
answer is supposedly inside the word...]

916
01:03:28,170 --> 01:03:32,360
[Just what could it mean?]

917
01:03:33,710 --> 01:03:37,220
[Right around the same time...]

918
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:45,240
[007 Seung Gi also discovers a USB!]

919
01:03:49,320 --> 01:03:51,440
It's telling me I need to use
my computer...

920
01:04:02,890 --> 01:04:04,850
Water sniper?

921
01:04:07,030 --> 01:04:08,540
Water sniper?

922
01:04:08,540 --> 01:04:14,560
[They said the answer is within
the word...]

923
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,780
[Gary also discovers the USB hint!]

924
01:04:20,780 --> 01:04:23,920
It fits...

925
01:04:24,690 --> 01:04:28,180
It says hint right here...

926
01:04:37,070 --> 01:04:39,260
Look at the whole picture.
Spread out the seeds wide.

927
01:04:40,260 --> 01:04:45,140
007 has something very important...

928
01:04:45,140 --> 01:04:47,700
That's the only hint I have.

929
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:50,620
The color of the seventh letter...

930
01:04:51,620 --> 01:04:53,370
is red.

931
01:04:53,370 --> 01:04:55,630
Does it have anything to do with 007?

932
01:05:04,920 --> 01:05:07,280
You have no desire to
rip off my name tag, right?

933
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:09,230
- No, I don't.
- I have no desire to either.

934
01:05:11,830 --> 01:05:15,790
- Suk Jin!
- No... I'm holding myself in check.

935
01:05:18,670 --> 01:05:20,600
Jong Kook really is dangerous.

936
01:05:20,600 --> 01:05:23,460
- I told you, I'm positive it's Jong Kook.
- I'm sure of it.

937
01:05:25,190 --> 01:05:27,880
- You didn't oust Kwang Soo, did you?
- No, it seriously wasn't me.

938
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:30,260
- It's Jong Kook.
- Right? It's Jong Kook, isn't it?

939
01:05:30,810 --> 01:05:34,160
Hey, who are you? Tell us quickly.
Are you 007?

940
01:05:34,160 --> 01:05:37,350
If you're not 007, what are you?
Are you a spy? Are you the enemy?

941
01:05:37,350 --> 01:05:40,090
I'm asking just what it is that
you're supposed to be doing today.

942
01:05:40,090 --> 01:05:43,600
The way I see it, from the way you speak,
I don't think you're the villain.

943
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:46,250
Why would I be the villain?
I'm scared to death right now.

944
01:05:46,250 --> 01:05:49,150
- You're an agent, right?
- Of course, I'm an agent!

945
01:05:49,150 --> 01:05:51,870
- May I reveal it to you then.
- Who are you?

946
01:05:51,870 --> 01:05:55,220
- What is your identity?
- I'm telling you, I'm 007!

947
01:05:55,220 --> 01:05:59,080
- I'm 007...
- If you're the villain, we're over!

948
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:00,180
I'm seriously not the villain!

949
01:06:00,180 --> 01:06:03,790
You're the one who sang
'Will you marry me' with an innocent face.

950
01:06:04,870 --> 01:06:07,630
You're the one who sang to my wife
with that sweet expression.

951
01:06:07,630 --> 01:06:09,030
If you're lying,
I'm never going to talk to you again.

952
01:06:09,030 --> 01:06:12,860
- I'm serious.
- Tell me... tell me why it's you.

953
01:06:12,870 --> 01:06:16,230
[Suk Jin and Ha Ha giving Seung Gi
the benefit of the doubt that he's 007.]

954
01:06:16,230 --> 01:06:17,840
I'm sure there's some kind of a sign.

955
01:06:17,840 --> 01:06:19,720
You're saying there could be
more than one villain?

956
01:06:19,720 --> 01:06:22,420
- Of course!
- There way I see it, there's about two.

957
01:06:22,420 --> 01:06:25,280
There's about three of them!
No, hear me out!

958
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:29,610
- The villain... is Jong Kook...
- Jong Kook must be the head.

959
01:06:29,610 --> 01:06:34,140
There's one head villain, and the women...
there has to be at least one woman.

960
01:06:34,140 --> 01:06:36,810
Whenever you watch 007 movies,
there's always a woman spy!

961
01:06:36,810 --> 01:06:39,320
- Bond girl! Bond girl!
- That's what I'm saying!

962
01:06:39,330 --> 01:06:42,130
- Shin Hye... and Ji Hyo...
- Shin Hye and Ji Hyo, get rid of them.

963
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:47,260
- Jong Kook is 100% the villain.
- Jong Kook is for sure.

964
01:06:47,260 --> 01:06:48,490
Let's get rid of Jong Kook first.

965
01:06:53,590 --> 01:06:55,120
- Did you see it?
- What?

966
01:06:55,120 --> 01:06:56,960
- You didn't see the bomb?
- I saw it.

967
01:06:58,020 --> 01:06:59,660
- Ah... the timer?
- Yeah.

968
01:06:59,660 --> 01:07:01,880
Shin Hye and Ji Hyo are both
really good at acting.

969
01:07:01,880 --> 01:07:05,780
[Ji Hyo and Shin Hye's reactions
are both so lively.]

970
01:07:05,780 --> 01:07:07,080
I feel like I'm watching a drama.

971
01:07:09,410 --> 01:07:12,020
- Shin Hye, have you found anything?
- I heard that Kwang Soo's been ousted?

972
01:07:12,020 --> 01:07:14,450
Suk Jin told me that you're
the one who did it.

973
01:07:14,450 --> 01:07:15,880
Why does he always do that?

974
01:07:15,880 --> 01:07:20,190
- He said that you...
- He told me that you did it too.

975
01:07:20,190 --> 01:07:22,920
When did Kwang Soo and I
ride in the elevator together?

976
01:07:24,030 --> 01:07:26,190
- Wait, I have to go to the bathroom.
- We rode it together a long time ago.

977
01:07:26,190 --> 01:07:27,720
When we were all going our
separate way earlier.

978
01:07:28,300 --> 01:07:30,120
That's such an absurd thing to say!

979
01:07:32,100 --> 01:07:34,480
Jong Kook... did you find any hints?

980
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:36,130
No, I haven't found any.

981
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:42,620
[Ah... Shin Hye's about to pass on some
information to Mr. Capable, the villain.]

982
01:07:44,280 --> 01:07:46,370
There's a 007...

983
01:07:48,190 --> 01:07:53,420
[Shin Hye reveals that 007 has
something very important!]

984
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:57,710
The person who's 007 has
an important hint.

985
01:07:57,710 --> 01:07:59,210
[Shin Hye passing on that important
information to Mr. Capable!]

986
01:07:59,210 --> 01:08:05,970
[Is this without knowing he's the villain?
Or could she be..?]

987
01:08:05,970 --> 01:08:09,740
To be honest, Jae Suk is the one
who gained the most points yesterday.

988
01:08:10,130 --> 01:08:13,720
And Seung Gi got first place.
He and Seung Gi were on the same team.

989
01:08:13,720 --> 01:08:19,190
[Shin Hye convinced that 007 needs to be
found in order to gain the hint.]

990
01:08:19,190 --> 01:08:21,240
So 007 doesn't know that he
has the hint.

991
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:26,110
Since he doesn't know, we have to find him.
And we either have to rip off his name tag...

992
01:08:26,110 --> 01:08:28,160
[No matter, 007 must be found!]

993
01:08:31,330 --> 01:08:36,240
[On the other hand,
007 Seung Gi discovers the time bomb.]

994
01:08:38,400 --> 01:08:43,750
[An alphabet combination lock that must
be solved by gathering all the hints!]

995
01:08:46,700 --> 01:08:48,540
- No, start over.
- What are you doing?

996
01:08:48,540 --> 01:08:50,430
I'm trying to open this.

997
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:52,720
Did you find something?

998
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:58,340
[Gary found 'Newspaper'
and Seung Gi found 'Water Sniper.]

999
01:08:58,340 --> 01:09:00,710
Ah, you're trying to guess?
Did you find any hints?

1000
01:09:00,710 --> 01:09:02,190
Yes, I found it downstairs.

1001
01:09:02,190 --> 01:09:04,030
- I can't tell you that.
- You're right.

1002
01:09:04,030 --> 01:09:07,720
- Gary... you found a hint, right?
- I haven't found any.

1003
01:09:08,990 --> 01:09:10,620
No, I seriously haven't found any.

1004
01:09:10,620 --> 01:09:15,220
[A simple face that shows whenever
he's lying.]

1005
01:09:15,220 --> 01:09:17,630
- No, seriously... I haven't found any.
- Come on... you did find one!

1006
01:09:17,640 --> 01:09:19,550
I seriously haven't found any.

1007
01:09:19,550 --> 01:09:21,550
- I got a phone call.
- Who is it?

1008
01:09:21,550 --> 01:09:22,680
Hello?

1009
01:09:22,680 --> 01:09:24,360
- Gary...
- Yeah, Ji Hyo.

1010
01:09:28,230 --> 01:09:33,260
[Is Gary the villain?
He's acting suspicious...]

1011
01:09:33,260 --> 01:09:35,690
[I think he does have a hint.
Maybe I should...]

1012
01:09:50,940 --> 01:09:52,420
You can't rip it off now.
You can't rip it off now!

1013
01:09:52,420 --> 01:09:54,550
I have a hint!

1014
01:09:54,550 --> 01:09:57,010
- I could've won...
- You said you didn't have any hints.

1015
01:09:57,010 --> 01:09:59,130
You said you didn't have any.
See? I knew you were lying.

1016
01:09:59,130 --> 01:10:02,150
[Should've just been honest
about knowing a hint...]

1017
01:10:02,830 --> 01:10:05,950
004... I'm sorry, I thought...

1018
01:10:05,950 --> 01:10:07,910
Why are you so suspicious looking?

1019
01:10:07,910 --> 01:10:12,050
- You just look so suspicious...
- I was really trying to win today.

1020
01:10:13,300 --> 01:10:15,670
I was really trying to win today...

1021
01:10:15,670 --> 01:10:18,780
Gary, trust me. I'll win for you instead.
Tell me what the hint is.

1022
01:10:18,780 --> 01:10:20,580
- Trust me.
- I have to give it to you?

1023
01:10:21,590 --> 01:10:25,600
The reason is... I know something.
There's a spy within the agents.

1024
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:29,100
- I was going to get 007.
- Why would you get 007?

1025
01:10:29,100 --> 01:10:31,400
Gary, have you ever seen 007
be the villain?

1026
01:10:32,530 --> 01:10:35,250
If you had given this to me sooner,
we could've been on the same team!

1027
01:10:35,970 --> 01:10:40,440
<i>[Gary, out! Gary, out!]</i>

1028
01:10:42,690 --> 01:10:48,700
[On the other hand, extremely
nervous Suk Jin and Ha Ha...]

1029
01:10:51,220 --> 01:10:54,960
[Ha Ha discovers a USB with the hint!]

1030
01:10:54,970 --> 01:10:58,410
We need to keep this hidden.
We can't tell Seung Gi about it.

1031
01:10:58,410 --> 01:11:01,100
But I have the machine.

1032
01:11:01,100 --> 01:11:06,690
[Ha Ha not having received a PC from
having placed last in last week's mission.]

1033
01:11:07,480 --> 01:11:10,510
- But you can tell me, right?
- Of course. Trust me.

1034
01:11:11,220 --> 01:11:14,770
You can trust me with anything.
You're like a Father to me.

1035
01:11:16,600 --> 01:11:19,190
I'm just joking. Hurry... hurry!

1036
01:11:19,970 --> 01:11:22,440
[Finally succeeds in borrowing the PC!]

1037
01:11:22,440 --> 01:11:24,210
- Lock the door.
- See what it is.

1038
01:11:24,210 --> 01:11:26,220
- Take a look. I'll stay here.
- Okay.

1039
01:11:28,840 --> 01:11:30,860
<i>Lets look at it together!</i>

1040
01:11:30,860 --> 01:11:34,790
[Hint hyena, Agent 001!]

1041
01:11:35,470 --> 01:11:39,460
[Rule: Free to share the information,
but the finder must view it alone first!]

1042
01:11:39,460 --> 01:11:43,760
The reason why I'll tell you is
so that you know I'm not the villain.

1043
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:50,830
[But Agent Haroro doesn't know
where to insert the card.]

1044
01:11:50,830 --> 01:11:52,630
I, the IT specialist will do it.

1045
01:11:53,580 --> 01:11:55,440
- I thought you knew computers...
- Let me see it.

1046
01:11:56,310 --> 01:12:01,690
[At this rate, he won't be able to see
the hint he worked hard to find alone.]

1047
01:12:01,690 --> 01:12:03,530
- I'm not going to take it.
- You've stolen hints from me before.

1048
01:12:03,530 --> 01:12:05,190
- I don't want to!
- Trust me.

1049
01:12:05,190 --> 01:12:08,510
- You're not the one who found the hint?
- I'm the one with the computer.

1050
01:12:09,100 --> 01:12:11,850
Jae Suk, don't help me work this,
but just keep going on your way.

1051
01:12:11,850 --> 01:12:14,340
This is where I was headed.

1052
01:12:14,340 --> 01:12:16,280
Hurry up and try it.

1053
01:12:16,280 --> 01:12:21,900
[Still a foreign device to Ha Ha?]

1054
01:12:23,120 --> 01:12:24,780
You really are awful at that.

1055
01:12:26,980 --> 01:12:31,060
He doesn't even know what he's doing.
Let me see it!

1056
01:12:31,070 --> 01:12:32,610
Seriously...

1057
01:12:34,390 --> 01:12:37,040
- You two are talking too much!
- You're really horrible at it!

1058
01:12:39,080 --> 01:12:41,800
He doesn't even know how to use that
when he has it in his hands.

1059
01:12:41,800 --> 01:12:44,200
- Just give it to me!
- He doesn't even know how to use it.

1060
01:12:44,200 --> 01:12:45,510
Seriously...

1061
01:12:47,170 --> 01:12:49,370
- Just give it to me!
- You're out? So you're 003?

1062
01:12:50,280 --> 01:12:52,320
- You can't even do that?
- How could you just...

1063
01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:57,220
<i>[Ha Ha, out! Ha Ha, out!]</i>

1064
01:12:57,500 --> 01:13:01,140
[Cruel Big-nosed Brother making an
appearance for the first time in a while.]

1065
01:13:01,140 --> 01:13:02,850
Just go.
Go where you're supposed to go.

1066
01:13:03,750 --> 01:13:05,790
Hurry up and get going.
Why are you still here?

1067
01:13:08,930 --> 01:13:11,720
[Two checking the hint
Ha Ha found together.]

1068
01:13:21,710 --> 01:13:25,380
[They've found all the hints
that are supposed to be here...]

1069
01:13:35,690 --> 01:13:39,470
[The seventh letter in each word.]

1070
01:13:41,420 --> 01:13:45,820
[The passcode to the chamber is OPEN.]

1071
01:13:49,390 --> 01:13:53,420
[The two middle-aged men who still
haven't figured it out.]

1072
01:13:57,110 --> 01:14:01,060
- Let's just get going for now...
- Okay, Suk Jin. Let's go.

1073
01:14:01,460 --> 01:14:02,980
It's Jong Kook.

1074
01:14:03,690 --> 01:14:07,720
[Villain on the move... Mr. Capable!]

1075
01:14:09,240 --> 01:14:13,360
[From being flustered,
Big-nosed Brother drops the USB.]

1076
01:14:15,880 --> 01:14:20,410
[Two estimated Bond girls and Mr. Capable...
Being surrounded from all sides!]

1077
01:14:20,410 --> 01:14:23,090
[Big-nosed Brother besieged!]

1078
01:14:23,090 --> 01:14:25,290
I know that you were working
with Ha Ha...

1079
01:14:25,290 --> 01:14:28,860
[Agent 001 escaping out of there!]

1080
01:14:34,220 --> 01:14:37,380
- And Suk Jin... what is that?
- What are you guys?

1081
01:14:37,380 --> 01:14:39,760
We've been sharing our information
and working together.

1082
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:41,610
- Aren't you the villain?
- No, I'm not.

1083
01:14:43,650 --> 01:14:48,210
[In that case... there's
only one person I can ask for help!]

1084
01:14:48,220 --> 01:14:49,380
Jae Suk!

1085
01:14:50,380 --> 01:14:52,130
I think I need to go, Seung Gi.

1086
01:15:01,510 --> 01:15:05,060
[I need to form an alliance
with Jae Suk!]

1087
01:15:05,060 --> 01:15:06,780
That really startled me.

1088
01:15:06,780 --> 01:15:08,960
What if Seung Gi is the spy?

1089
01:15:09,670 --> 01:15:13,020
[Too dangerous to remain alone...
what do I do?]

1090
01:15:13,670 --> 01:15:16,780
- See? A telephone pops up.
- I know! It says telephone.

1091
01:15:16,780 --> 01:15:18,760
There are four of these.

1092
01:15:19,490 --> 01:15:22,650
[Having found another hint by
having Suk Jin surrounded.]

1093
01:15:22,650 --> 01:15:25,960
We have to catch anyone who has a
hint and get it out of them.

1094
01:15:27,040 --> 01:15:29,860
[First...]

1095
01:15:29,860 --> 01:15:31,090
Why?

1096
01:15:31,800 --> 01:15:35,610
[Eliminating Big-nosed Brother now
that he's no longer deemed useful.]

1097
01:15:36,390 --> 01:15:39,160
[007 is still alive!]

1098
01:15:41,620 --> 01:15:44,810
- It's either Seung Gi or Jae Suk.
- You're right.

1099
01:15:44,810 --> 01:15:49,450
<i>[Ji Suk Jin, out! Ji Suk Jin, out!]</i>

1100
01:15:49,450 --> 01:15:51,840
007 needs to take care of this...

1101
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:54,800
[007 put in a spot where it's
getting difficult to make his move.]

1102
01:15:55,720 --> 01:15:57,900
I think those three are on
the same team.

1103
01:15:58,700 --> 01:16:02,530
[Convinced there are at least
two villains involved.]

1104
01:16:04,740 --> 01:16:08,010
Kwang Soo was ousted when he and
Jong Kook went downstairs together.

1105
01:16:08,650 --> 01:16:10,640
And I ousted Gary.

1106
01:16:11,520 --> 01:16:12,960
Sorry to say...

1107
01:16:12,960 --> 01:16:16,170
And... Suk Jin was just ousted
in that room.

1108
01:16:17,400 --> 01:16:19,440
It's Jong Kook. He's the villain.

1109
01:16:21,040 --> 01:16:24,250
[So what do I do now?]

1110
01:16:35,030 --> 01:16:39,820
[Jae Suk, the only person 007 can trust.]

1111
01:16:39,820 --> 01:16:41,360
- What?
- Come here.

1112
01:16:41,360 --> 01:16:43,710
You have to trust me 100%
from now on.

1113
01:16:44,270 --> 01:16:46,190
Why is everyone telling me
to trust them?

1114
01:16:48,240 --> 01:16:50,170
- Everyone's telling me to trust them.
- Come on, come on...

1115
01:16:50,520 --> 01:16:54,630
[007 Seung Gi trying to convince Jae Suk
into forming an alliance with him.]

1116
01:16:54,630 --> 01:16:56,180
- Jae Suk...
- What?

1117
01:16:56,970 --> 01:16:59,110
What is it that you know?

1118
01:16:59,570 --> 01:17:02,620
Why is everyone asking me to
tell them what I know?

1119
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:06,720
- I'll tell you what I know.
- What is it?

1120
01:17:06,730 --> 01:17:12,180
Gary, Kwang Soo, Suk Jin,
and Ha Ha have all been ousted.

1121
01:17:12,930 --> 01:17:15,340
- I'm the one who ousted Gary.
- You! I knew it!

1122
01:17:15,340 --> 01:17:16,990
Why did you oust him?

1123
01:17:16,990 --> 01:17:19,360
I ousted him because his
face was so suspicious looking.

1124
01:17:19,360 --> 01:17:21,630
[Eliminated because of his
suspicious looking face!]

1125
01:17:21,630 --> 01:17:23,620
His face looked like this...

1126
01:17:24,760 --> 01:17:27,680
- That's why I had no choice but to oust him.
- Really?

1127
01:17:27,680 --> 01:17:28,880
But he was an agent.

1128
01:17:28,890 --> 01:17:31,970
I ran into Jong Kook on my way
into the room with the bomb.

1129
01:17:31,970 --> 01:17:36,240
But Jong Kook was on the phone, and he
said 'What floor? Okay, be right there'.

1130
01:17:36,240 --> 01:17:38,660
and then he left.
Then Ha Ha was ousted right after that.

1131
01:17:38,660 --> 01:17:41,780
I saw that earlier,
but Suk Jin's the one who ousted Ha Ha.

1132
01:17:41,780 --> 01:17:43,740
Oh, really?

1133
01:17:44,950 --> 01:17:48,380
- You seem disappointed.
- No, it's okay. There's something else.

1134
01:17:48,380 --> 01:17:51,150
If you didn't have anything else,
I wasn't going to trust you.

1135
01:17:51,150 --> 01:17:53,640
I saw Ha Ha getting ousted with
my own eyes.

1136
01:17:53,640 --> 01:17:56,710
- What's wrong with those two?
- He was ousted in midst of a confusion.

1137
01:17:56,710 --> 01:17:57,940
- Really?
- Totally.

1138
01:17:57,940 --> 01:18:00,340
Okay, then lastly...
did you see Suk Jin getting ousted?

1139
01:18:00,340 --> 01:18:02,960
I did see him getting caught.

1140
01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:05,840
- Who caught him?
- Jong Kook, Ji Hyo and Shin Hye.

1141
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:08,430
That's what I mean.
Those three ousted him.

1142
01:18:08,430 --> 01:18:10,930
- I get it.
- Those three are the villains.

1143
01:18:10,930 --> 01:18:13,160
Those three are telling me
that you're the villain.

1144
01:18:13,880 --> 01:18:16,670
I'm going to tell you this... I'm 007.

1145
01:18:19,890 --> 01:18:21,180
- Really?
- Yes.

1146
01:18:21,550 --> 01:18:23,430
- You're an 00 agent, right?
- Yeah.

1147
01:18:23,430 --> 01:18:25,450
If you're one of us, then trust me.

1148
01:18:25,460 --> 01:18:29,290
The reason why is...
the villain is one of the agents.

1149
01:18:29,290 --> 01:18:33,780
[Information 001 Jae Suk wasn't aware of...
The villain is one of the agents!]

1150
01:18:33,780 --> 01:18:36,570
[Trust me, Jae Suk!]

1151
01:18:38,600 --> 01:18:42,380
[Jae Suk calling Mr. Capable.]

1152
01:18:42,380 --> 01:18:44,270
Kim Jong Kook, where are you?

1153
01:18:44,270 --> 01:18:46,900
- Hey, where are you?
- I'm with the girls.

1154
01:18:46,900 --> 01:18:48,110
What?

1155
01:18:48,110 --> 01:18:49,630
<i>Tell me the truth.</i>

1156
01:18:49,630 --> 01:18:51,150
Are you a spy?

1157
01:18:51,150 --> 01:18:52,780
<i>Are you a spy?</i>

1158
01:18:53,540 --> 01:18:56,310
Seriously, this is driving me crazy!
Jae Suk...

1159
01:18:56,310 --> 01:18:59,560
Why would I be with the girls
if I'm the spy?

1160
01:19:00,830 --> 01:19:02,340
What floor are you on right now?

1161
01:19:02,340 --> 01:19:04,580
- We're on the 17th floor.
- I got it.

1162
01:19:05,890 --> 01:19:07,960
- He says he's on the 17th floor.
- 17th floor?

1163
01:19:11,630 --> 01:19:14,590
But why can't you just go along
with my plan?

1164
01:19:14,590 --> 01:19:20,480
But what those guys are saying...
why did you oust, Gary?

1165
01:19:21,130 --> 01:19:23,900
I didn't know it would be so...
oh my goodness.

1166
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:26,910
- You're going up to 17th floor?
- Yeah, I am.

1167
01:19:26,910 --> 01:19:28,390
- You're going to get caught!
- Come here.

1168
01:19:28,390 --> 01:19:31,120
You're going to get caught!
Get off. I'm sorry.

1169
01:19:32,740 --> 01:19:35,430
[007 Seung Gi pulling Jae Suk out.]

1170
01:19:35,430 --> 01:19:37,970
You really... you're really decisive.

1171
01:19:42,180 --> 01:19:44,380
You're really not the spy...
I mean, the villain?

1172
01:19:44,380 --> 01:19:45,980
I swear I'm not the villain.

1173
01:19:45,980 --> 01:19:48,740
- Jae Suk, seriously...
- Wait.

1174
01:19:48,740 --> 01:19:53,320
You can't go up to the 17th floor!
We need to come up with a plan first!

1175
01:19:54,880 --> 01:19:59,010
I guess not going up there would be
suspicious too. I don't know...

1176
01:19:59,020 --> 01:20:01,680
It would be weird not to go after
telling them that we will.

1177
01:20:01,680 --> 01:20:04,600
- If we go...
- We have to go, otherwise, he'll suspect me.

1178
01:20:04,600 --> 01:20:06,960
- We have to get the information...
- See? He's calling me again.

1179
01:20:08,580 --> 01:20:10,450
If I don't go,
they're going to suspect me.

1180
01:20:10,450 --> 01:20:12,860
Wait... don't' answer right now.
Just wait.

1181
01:20:12,860 --> 01:20:15,010
- Wait...
- You're acting so weird!

1182
01:20:15,010 --> 01:20:18,060
[About to go crazy out of frustration.]

1183
01:20:19,020 --> 01:20:20,950
- Jong Kook...
- Hurry up!

1184
01:20:20,950 --> 01:20:22,850
- Where are you?
- On the 17th floor!

1185
01:20:22,850 --> 01:20:24,530
Okay, wait right there.

1186
01:20:25,820 --> 01:20:27,470
What the heck?
He suddenly hung up.

1187
01:20:31,110 --> 01:20:35,350
The moment that you go up there...
it's game over.

1188
01:20:35,350 --> 01:20:36,900
- It's final.
- He's calling again.

1189
01:20:37,270 --> 01:20:40,430
- Take the battery out.
- Wait, what are you doing?

1190
01:20:40,430 --> 01:20:44,410
[Unsure 001 vs. Frustrated 007]

1191
01:20:44,410 --> 01:20:48,210
- Where are you? What floor?
- Um... wait...

1192
01:20:48,890 --> 01:20:51,510
- What floor?
- I'll come up to the 17th floor.

1193
01:20:51,510 --> 01:20:53,950
<i>Then hurry up!
We're about to separate.</i>

1194
01:20:53,950 --> 01:20:58,190
- See? You could just come with me.
- If we go together, we'll both be caught.

1195
01:20:58,200 --> 01:21:01,420
I bet they're right in front of the elevator.
We'll be caught the moment the doors open.

1196
01:21:01,420 --> 01:21:04,570
- No, it won't be like that.
- 15th... let's go up to the 15th floor.

1197
01:21:04,570 --> 01:21:06,350
I'm telling you, I have to go.

1198
01:21:06,350 --> 01:21:09,380
[Why isn't he coming up here?]

1199
01:21:10,720 --> 01:21:12,430
Why can't you trust me? Seriously?

1200
01:21:12,430 --> 01:21:16,490
It's not that I don't trust you,
but I'm positive the hint said 007 is the villain.

1201
01:21:16,490 --> 01:21:18,740
Rip it off then.
Go ahead and rip it off.

1202
01:21:18,740 --> 01:21:20,990
Seriously, just rip it off so that
I can just get it over with and go.

1203
01:21:20,990 --> 01:21:23,670
- Look at this. He's freaking out.
- See? Look at that.

1204
01:21:23,680 --> 01:21:26,290
He keeps calling because he's the villain.
He's pulling you into his evil lair.

1205
01:21:26,290 --> 01:21:28,710
Have you ever seen a good guy
calling this many times?

1206
01:21:29,840 --> 01:21:31,320
- Let's go to the 16th floor.
- Hello?

1207
01:21:31,320 --> 01:21:33,500
- What floor on you on?
- Right now...

1208
01:21:33,500 --> 01:21:35,630
Jae Suk, let's meet on the eighth floor.

1209
01:21:36,420 --> 01:21:37,460
You want to meet on the eighth floor?

1210
01:21:37,460 --> 01:21:42,520
We've decided to go down to the eighth floor
because we've decided that's where you are.

1211
01:21:42,520 --> 01:21:43,940
Okay.

1212
01:21:46,900 --> 01:21:50,420
Jae Suk... we have to do this.
We have to oust him as soon as we see him.

1213
01:21:51,280 --> 01:21:53,770
The only chance we have is
when he gets off the elevator.

1214
01:21:53,770 --> 01:21:56,680
If we don't, we'll be taken hostage.
Come on, Jae Suk...

1215
01:21:56,680 --> 01:22:00,270
I've done this once and
ousted someone who was on my side.

1216
01:22:00,280 --> 01:22:03,880
That's why I'm telling you to oust me.
If you don't trust me, then just oust me.

1217
01:22:03,880 --> 01:22:06,170
You could be my ally too though!

1218
01:22:06,170 --> 01:22:08,300
Can't you just pick one?

1219
01:22:09,960 --> 01:22:12,030
[Getting off on the eighth floor for now.]

1220
01:22:12,030 --> 01:22:15,120
Why do I have to make this decision.
Hey, just rip my name tag off.

1221
01:22:15,120 --> 01:22:17,180
You can just rip mine off...

1222
01:22:17,830 --> 01:22:20,610
12th floor... 17th floor is coming down!

1223
01:22:20,610 --> 01:22:22,670
[They're coming!]

1224
01:22:26,260 --> 01:22:27,670
Just go over there.

1225
01:22:27,670 --> 01:22:30,100
I just need to stand here and
oust Jong Kook!

1226
01:22:33,100 --> 01:22:38,540
[No time and can't be convinced!]

1227
01:22:38,540 --> 01:22:40,710
Because once we get rid of Jong Kook,
only the girls are left remaining!

1228
01:22:41,190 --> 01:22:43,240
Because they're the villains!

1229
01:22:43,240 --> 01:22:46,240
16th floor... hurry! Hurry!

1230
01:22:50,780 --> 01:22:54,040
- Let's do this today... seriously...
- Okay.

1231
01:22:55,580 --> 01:22:57,900
What are you going to do if Jong Kook
ends up being on our side after we oust him?

1232
01:22:57,900 --> 01:23:00,210
No way... there's no way!
I'll give you all my money!

1233
01:23:00,210 --> 01:23:01,910
All the money I have.
I'll give you all my bank books.

1234
01:23:01,910 --> 01:23:06,900
[I'll give you all my money and the house,
so please trust me!]

1235
01:23:12,310 --> 01:23:15,690
[The three finally arrive
on the eighth floor!]

1236
01:23:19,010 --> 01:23:20,430
We're here... we're here.

1237
01:23:20,430 --> 01:23:22,870
What were you doing?
Why didn't you come?

1238
01:23:22,870 --> 01:23:24,490
Why didn't you come?

1239
01:23:24,490 --> 01:23:26,110
I went up to the 17th floor,
and just came back down.

1240
01:23:28,610 --> 01:23:29,990
Where's Seung Gi?

1241
01:23:30,540 --> 01:23:32,100
[I'm right here!]

1242
01:23:36,790 --> 01:23:40,900
[007 Seung Gi!
Ambushes Mr. Capable and ousts him!]

1243
01:23:41,420 --> 01:23:45,620
[The black entity is still alive.]

1244
01:23:45,620 --> 01:23:47,930
- You believe me? You believe me?
- What does this mean though?

1245
01:23:49,050 --> 01:23:50,760
It's you! You're the villain!

1246
01:23:51,890 --> 01:23:53,350
Seriously?

1247
01:23:53,350 --> 01:23:56,110
- Seriously?
- You almost had me fooled!

1248
01:23:56,110 --> 01:23:59,570
[Just then...
Shin Hye's suspicious glint in her eye.]

1249
01:24:00,850 --> 01:24:02,230
Seung Gi, I'm sorry.

1250
01:24:04,390 --> 01:24:08,770
[Shin Hye rids Agent 001 of
his name tag!]

1251
01:24:08,770 --> 01:24:12,760
<i>[Yoo Jae Suk, out! Yoo Jae Suk, out!]</i>

1252
01:24:12,760 --> 01:24:15,360
See? Do you believe me now?
Did I do good or what?

1253
01:24:15,360 --> 01:24:18,110
You're right.
What you said was right.

1254
01:24:18,110 --> 01:24:20,490
I almost made the big mistake
of ousting Seung Gi.

1255
01:24:21,530 --> 01:24:26,900
[Off to jail for Jong Kook and
001 Jae Suk.]

1256
01:24:28,470 --> 01:24:30,800
- So you were the villain!
- It's not me.

1257
01:24:31,300 --> 01:24:33,990
It says here on your tag that
the black entity is still alive.

1258
01:24:35,560 --> 01:24:39,380
[The real villain is still alive...]

1259
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:41,460
'The black entity is still alive'...

1260
01:24:41,460 --> 01:24:44,250
Then it means that there's a real villain
out there other than Jong Kook.

1261
01:24:44,250 --> 01:24:48,990
[The black entity is still alive.
Who is the other villain?]

1262
01:24:49,690 --> 01:24:53,350
Since both of you are so good at acting,
I don't know which one of you are acting.

1263
01:24:53,350 --> 01:24:55,930
[No way to read their expression since
Shin Hye and Ji Hyo are both good actors.]

1264
01:24:55,930 --> 01:25:00,420
- Are you going to give us the hint, or...
- Why do you need the hint?

1265
01:25:01,200 --> 01:25:03,280
- Because we have to stop the bomb!
- We have to stop it!

1266
01:25:03,280 --> 01:25:06,190
Really? Oh yeah, there's that...

1267
01:25:07,760 --> 01:25:10,470
In that case, let's not hang around here,
and go over to the site.

1268
01:25:10,470 --> 01:25:12,180
- Lead the way.
- Let's go.

1269
01:25:12,180 --> 01:25:16,020
[Deciding for now to head over to
where the bomb is located.]

1270
01:25:23,520 --> 01:25:26,200
- We can open it with a number.
- I'm 007!

1271
01:25:26,200 --> 01:25:27,640
I'm 007!

1272
01:25:27,640 --> 01:25:31,770
[There was a suspicion,
but this bubble head is 007!]

1273
01:25:31,770 --> 01:25:33,380
I'm 007. Why?

1274
01:25:33,380 --> 01:25:35,050
You're a villain, aren't you?

1275
01:25:35,050 --> 01:25:38,190
- I'm not the villain. I'm 004.
- I'm 008.

1276
01:25:38,190 --> 01:25:39,800
- Yeah.
- 008?

1277
01:25:40,760 --> 01:25:43,160
Then doesn't it mean that the villain
has already been eliminated?

1278
01:25:44,870 --> 01:25:49,620
[If that's the truth, then the three of them
have to join forces to stop the bomb!]

1279
01:25:49,620 --> 01:25:53,550
- You said 007 had something, right?
- I was told that 007 had something...

1280
01:25:53,550 --> 01:25:55,760
- Come here.
- Knowing who 007 is can solve the code?

1281
01:25:55,760 --> 01:25:58,720
Then what is this?
Have I been used by the producers?

1282
01:26:00,460 --> 01:26:06,190
[Whether you're an agent or a villain,
the bomb still must be stopped!]

1283
01:26:08,430 --> 01:26:11,170
Okay, number one. Water sniper.

1284
01:26:11,890 --> 01:26:13,620
Number two. Newspaper.

1285
01:26:13,620 --> 01:26:15,890
Number three, telephone,
then giraffe, right?

1286
01:26:15,890 --> 01:26:17,020
That's what you know, right?

1287
01:26:17,020 --> 01:26:18,460
Yeah.

1288
01:26:19,430 --> 01:26:22,380
[Out of sense of urgency,
rushing to the keypad first!]

1289
01:26:23,830 --> 01:26:29,300
[If they can't figure out OPEN by putting
together seventh letter of each word...]

1290
01:26:29,300 --> 01:26:30,950
Try solving it. How do we solve it?

1291
01:26:31,690 --> 01:26:34,480
- Seung Gi... let's rip it off.
- Mine?

1292
01:26:34,480 --> 01:26:36,290
- No...
- We're going to...

1293
01:26:38,290 --> 01:26:42,270
[Shin Hye eyeing for the chance
eliminates Seung Gi's name tag!]

1294
01:26:44,460 --> 01:26:48,490
[Shin Hye... why...]

1295
01:26:48,930 --> 01:26:53,420
[Since 007 is supposed to have something,
ousting him as a step...]

1296
01:26:53,420 --> 01:26:55,160
Let me see your name tag.

1297
01:26:55,660 --> 01:26:57,450
[Just then!]

1298
01:26:58,860 --> 01:27:00,990
[Shin Hye going for Ji Hyo!]

1299
01:27:02,370 --> 01:27:05,530
[Ji Hyo's an agent!]

1300
01:27:05,970 --> 01:27:12,000
[Revealed at last...
the villain's identity!]

1301
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:13,390
It's you?

1302
01:27:13,390 --> 01:27:14,870
Shin Hye, it was you?

1303
01:27:17,130 --> 01:27:19,410
[Black entity...
Bond girl here to steal the gold...]

1304
01:27:19,410 --> 01:27:24,250
[Park Shin Hye!]

1305
01:27:27,480 --> 01:27:29,150
[Earlier that morning]

1306
01:27:31,940 --> 01:27:34,740
<i>I will give you a chance to
get your revenge on MI6.</i>

1307
01:27:34,740 --> 01:27:38,090
[Park Shin Hye becomes the
black entity.]

1308
01:27:38,090 --> 01:27:42,900
[Park Shin Hye is the first to receive
the information of the vault's explosion!]

1309
01:27:42,900 --> 01:27:48,680
[Must disguise herself as an MI6 agent
to steal the gold before it explodes!]

1310
01:27:49,490 --> 01:27:53,210
I'm going to pull in the one person
who has a lot of grudges against MI6.

1311
01:27:53,210 --> 01:27:57,230
[Recruiting the one person who has been
disqualified from being an agent.]

1312
01:28:00,100 --> 01:28:04,120
[The evil accomplice that she
recruited is none other than...]

1313
01:28:04,120 --> 01:28:08,750
[Mr. Capable!]

1314
01:28:10,990 --> 01:28:14,310
<i>After stopping the bomb from exploding
in the vault at the Prism Tower</i>

1315
01:28:14,320 --> 01:28:16,950
<i>secretly steal away the gold.</i>

1316
01:28:19,820 --> 01:28:28,500
[Looking back, Shin Hye is the one who
kept feeding him information all along!]

1317
01:28:30,630 --> 01:28:35,310
[And the one who ripped off all the name
tags has been her all along!]

1318
01:28:37,790 --> 01:28:44,480
[After dragging out all four
of the hints out of other agents...]

1319
01:28:44,480 --> 01:28:47,460
[Eliminates 007 Seung Gi herself!]

1320
01:28:47,460 --> 01:28:50,300
[And eliminates the last remaining agent,
002 Ji Hyo as well!]

1321
01:28:50,310 --> 01:28:56,290
[The evil Bond girl is none other
than her!]

1322
01:28:58,740 --> 01:29:03,760
[All the hints that has been found
are handed over to Shin Hye.]

1323
01:29:03,770 --> 01:29:07,260
Then...
what if Ji Hyo eliminates Shin Hye?

1324
01:29:07,260 --> 01:29:09,990
- Then Ji Hyo...
- What is it that you have, Seung Gi?

1325
01:29:09,990 --> 01:29:12,290
It could be in your shoe.

1326
01:29:12,290 --> 01:29:14,180
[Huh?]

1327
01:29:15,690 --> 01:29:18,010
I was given these shoes by the show!
There's nothing... huh?

1328
01:29:19,450 --> 01:29:20,790
You didn't know something was
in there either?

1329
01:29:20,790 --> 01:29:24,070
[What? Another USB in the shoe?]

1330
01:29:25,050 --> 01:29:28,290
- How did you not know it was in there?
- Are you sure that you're not stupid?

1331
01:29:28,290 --> 01:29:30,520
[007's secret that even
007 didn't know about...]

1332
01:29:32,210 --> 01:29:34,490
See? There's an 'R' sticker on it!

1333
01:29:34,490 --> 01:29:36,690
I thought it was on it because
it was given to me by Running Man.

1334
01:29:36,690 --> 01:29:39,830
[A hint that he didn't detect even though
he's been wearing the shoe around all day]

1335
01:29:39,830 --> 01:29:42,770
[Just as his nickname states,
a bubble brain.]

1336
01:29:42,770 --> 01:29:44,950
So this was the hint given to 007.

1337
01:29:44,950 --> 01:29:49,900
[The important hint given to 007 has been
in his shoes from the very beginning.]

1338
01:29:52,450 --> 01:29:57,590
[Will the explosion come first...
or will she figure out the passcode first?]

1339
01:29:58,360 --> 01:30:03,800
[Even the villain Shin Hye needs to stop
the bomb in order to steal the gold!]

1340
01:30:05,310 --> 01:30:09,580
[Even Ji Hyo is helping getting the
vault opened after being ousted.]

1341
01:30:12,420 --> 01:30:18,920
Just from my deduction, I thought seventh
letter in each word since it's 007.

1342
01:30:18,920 --> 01:30:24,200
That's when I thought that maybe there's
something in the seventh letter of each word

1343
01:30:24,210 --> 01:30:27,940
so I thought it would have
something to do with the code

1344
01:30:27,940 --> 01:30:31,640
and then noticed that the lock on
the vault is actually alphabet letters.

1345
01:30:31,640 --> 01:30:38,650
[Will... those girls be able to
figure it out too?]

1346
01:31:08,310 --> 01:31:12,900
[Explosion of the vault]

1347
01:31:15,230 --> 01:31:16,770
- Awesome.
- I really am sorry.

1348
01:31:16,770 --> 01:31:20,240
[A failed mission for all the agents
and villains alike.]

1349
01:31:21,090 --> 01:31:23,580
- Shin Hye, you really...
- Jong Kook, I'm sorry.

1350
01:31:23,580 --> 01:31:25,560
I should've protected you to the end.

1351
01:31:26,730 --> 01:31:31,990
<i>The passcode for the lock was OPEN.
That would've opened up the vault right away.</i>

1352
01:31:31,990 --> 01:31:33,400
[The passcode was OPEN]

1353
01:31:33,400 --> 01:31:37,140
[The important information that
007 was given and wasn't aware of...]

1354
01:31:37,140 --> 01:31:38,520
He said he had no idea.

1355
01:31:38,520 --> 01:31:41,860
I realized that on Running Man,
you really have to pay attention to details.

1356
01:31:41,860 --> 01:31:43,830
- You didn't know?
- What was it?

1357
01:31:43,830 --> 01:31:45,500
There was a USB card inside my shoe.

1358
01:31:45,500 --> 01:31:50,410
<i>If you approached the vault with the USB
and the notebook, it would've opened up.</i>

1359
01:31:51,820 --> 01:31:54,830
I just needed to connect it?
I had both with me at all times too.

1360
01:31:54,830 --> 01:31:57,760
[Bubble Brain 007 who already had
everything he needed from the beginning.]

1361
01:31:59,070 --> 01:32:02,310
[For the next three months, there will be
no more gold prizes on Running Man.]

1362
01:32:02,310 --> 01:32:05,650
Kwang Soo, do you get it?
Do you get what's going on?

1363
01:32:05,660 --> 01:32:08,400
- I don't think he understands.
- I think I just need to go home!

1364
01:32:08,920 --> 01:32:10,870
I thought you were only coming
on the show last week and this week?

1365
01:32:11,540 --> 01:32:13,360
How can you say such a hurtful thing?

1366
