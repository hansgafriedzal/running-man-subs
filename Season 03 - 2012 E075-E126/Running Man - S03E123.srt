I really wanted to be part of it.

what was happening, don't you think?

522
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:33,700
- And two times too.
- Yes, two times.

takes everything.]</i>

848
00:50:07,460 --> 00:50:09,620
Let's take them home.

849
00:50:09,650 --> 00:50:13,190
<i>- How many was that?
- They took six of them.</i>

850
00:50:13,220 --> 00:50:15,950
That means we had 10.

851
00:50:17,530 --> 00:50:21,680
<i>[A tough woman, she
carries them all herself.]</i>

852
00:50:22,470 --> 00:50:24,760
She sure is meticulous.

853
00:50:25,950 --> 00:50:29,530
- Nobody saw it.
- We should hide them.

854
00:50:32,810 --> 00:50:35,960
<i>[Team Yellow plundered
four cabbages.]</i>

855
00:50:35,980 --> 00:50:38,000
<i>These are the ones?</i>

856
00:50:41,370 --> 00:50:43,860
<i>[Team Yellow also hides the
cabbages in their headquarters.]</i>

857
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:45,980
Hide them there.

858
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:49,060
<i>Stand guard right there.</i>

859
00:50:49,070 --> 00:50:53,560
<i>[Ace Ji Hyo is guarding the cabbages.]</i>

860
00:50:54,980 --> 00:50:58,070
- What are you doing here?
- It's too cold for you?

861
00:50:58,780 --> 00:51:00,690
What? What are you doing here?

862
00:51:00,710 --> 00:51:03,890
- You should offer greetings first.
- I am too cold.

863
00:51:03,910 --> 00:51:06,790
You should go to your house.

864
00:51:06,810 --> 00:51:08,370
And your house is so close too.

865
00:51:08,590 --> 00:51:11,540
I'm not going to be childish
and steal anything.

866
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:12,890
You know me.

867
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:15,510
I know you. Of course I do.

868
00:51:15,530 --> 00:51:20,160
But I'm here,
and you're so unwelcoming.

869
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:23,230
- What do you mean?
- You're so unwelcoming!

870
00:51:23,230 --> 00:51:26,350
- We didn't even greet each other.
- It's been seven years since we've met.

871
00:51:26,370 --> 00:51:28,530
That's right.

872
00:51:36,070 --> 00:51:39,230
[Go Soo urgent during dire times.]

873
00:51:40,510 --> 00:51:44,550
- You can't even do that.
- You were supposed to grab it.

874
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:49,870
So violent. So cruel.

875
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:54,170
[Again, he loiters about.]

876
00:51:57,010 --> 00:51:59,700
[What's this?]

877
00:52:01,340 --> 00:52:04,710
[What luck!
He discovers a cabbage!]

878
00:52:07,950 --> 00:52:11,520
[But instead of leaving it at
headquarters...]

879
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:19,380
[For now he leaves it in a place
only he knows of.]

880
00:52:21,180 --> 00:52:29,790
[Mostly slow, but occassionally fast.
Always tidy Go Soo.]

881
00:52:33,220 --> 00:52:35,790
There's the back door.
Hold on.

882
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:40,170
[Discovers the back door of headquarters!]

883
00:52:41,330 --> 00:52:46,980
[Stealing the cabbages]

884
00:52:48,450 --> 00:52:51,100
It's closed.

885
00:52:51,100 --> 00:52:54,630
See where it's hidden.

886
00:52:56,530 --> 00:52:59,340
[The purple team looks inside
and discovers cabbages!]

887
00:53:02,690 --> 00:53:07,260
Hey, hey, hey!
Hey, don't take that!

888
00:53:07,260 --> 00:53:11,080
Hey, hey, hey!

889
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:13,580
Hey, damn that guy!

890
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:21,370
- I forgot old houses have back doors.
- I forgot about the back door!

891
00:53:23,260 --> 00:53:26,370
[Everyone is anxious]

892
00:53:26,370 --> 00:53:30,870
This isn't finding. It's stealing.

893
00:53:30,870 --> 00:53:33,590
They're stealing more...

894
00:53:35,050 --> 00:53:43,030
This... this... not there...

895
00:53:43,030 --> 00:53:47,320
It'll be better to put this in
a place no one knows about.

896
00:53:50,860 --> 00:53:52,220
No. No...

897
00:53:52,220 --> 00:53:57,030
- We're on the same side!
- No! No. No.

898
00:54:00,580 --> 00:54:03,400
[He runs in the other direction.]

899
00:54:05,940 --> 00:54:07,950
I said stay there.

900
00:54:07,950 --> 00:54:10,570
- What are you doing?
- We're on the same team.

901
00:54:10,570 --> 00:54:12,610
Kwang Soo.

902
00:54:13,980 --> 00:54:17,400
[Giraffe shows no mercy on women.]

903
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:21,600
Kwang Soo, think it over.
If you take this cabbage...

904
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:23,280
Let me just take one.

905
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:25,550
Think about me.

906
00:54:25,550 --> 00:54:27,890
- Give me one. I'll protect it.
- Think it over carefully.

907
00:54:27,890 --> 00:54:30,140
If I...

908
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:33,060
[Big-nosed brother is here too.]

909
00:54:33,060 --> 00:54:37,780
Hey, I have something to say.
Something to say!

910
00:54:37,780 --> 00:54:40,080
Jae Suk!

911
00:54:40,950 --> 00:54:43,800
- There's nothing you can do.
- Jae Suk!

912
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:45,820
There's nothing you can do.

913
00:54:45,820 --> 00:54:48,240
Sorry. Sorry.

914
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:51,920
You should protect what's yours fool!

915
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:54,530
We're on the same team!

916
00:54:55,610 --> 00:54:59,170
[What a joke.]

917
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:03,390
[Fine. You're all dead.]

918
00:55:06,140 --> 00:55:08,610
[Jae Suk has arrived to steal./]

919
00:55:08,610 --> 00:55:12,120
What are you doing?
You think I'd leave it here?

920
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:14,890
I'm looking around.
Why did you take our stuff?

921
00:55:14,890 --> 00:55:17,810
- Why did you come here?
- Why did you take it?

922
00:55:17,810 --> 00:55:19,450
Why did you take our stuff?

923
00:55:20,580 --> 00:55:23,290
Why did you take our stuff?

924
00:55:23,290 --> 00:55:25,660
- I said why did you take it...
- We didn't take anything.

925
00:55:25,660 --> 00:55:28,080
- Hey look here.
- Try to take it.

926
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:30,200
Try to take it!

927
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:31,960
Take it away!

928
00:55:34,510 --> 00:55:39,920
Jae Suk. Throw it. Throw it!

929
00:55:42,270 --> 00:55:43,820
[Out of nowhere Go Soo appears.]

930
00:55:43,820 --> 00:55:45,300
Wait, this is ours.

931
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:48,930
[As expected,
Go Soo is fast when it counts.]

932
00:55:51,790 --> 00:55:54,880
[In the end, the purple team
gets nothing.]

933
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:58,140
- Isn't this too much?
- This is too much.

934
00:55:58,630 --> 00:56:01,400
- I'm going to protect everything.
- Make sure to protect it.

935
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:04,470
It's okay if I don't get camera time.
I'm just staying inside.

936
00:56:04,470 --> 00:56:07,320
Just stay in there.

937
00:56:07,780 --> 00:56:09,710
Ji Hyo!

938
00:56:09,710 --> 00:56:13,280
- We only need three more.
- Awesome.

939
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:17,620
All we need is three more.
Things are going our way!

940
00:56:17,620 --> 00:56:20,370
Suk Jin!
Awesome, there's one here!

941
00:56:20,370 --> 00:56:22,830
Look, we have three!

942
00:56:22,830 --> 00:56:25,150
Just two more.

943
00:56:25,620 --> 00:56:31,140
[Yellow team has eight.
Just two more!]

944
00:56:31,140 --> 00:56:34,330
- I'll be back.
- Suk Jin, we just need two more.

945
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:37,610
We're almost there.

946
00:56:38,140 --> 00:56:41,220
[Now's the time!]

947
00:56:43,090 --> 00:56:46,840
[Time to take out the cabbages
I hid so well.]

948
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:52,540
Leave it there. The camera! Camera!

949
00:56:52,540 --> 00:56:55,100
Go Soo! What are you doing?

950
00:56:55,100 --> 00:56:59,510
Here. Close the door.
Hurry up and close the door.

951
00:56:59,510 --> 00:57:03,640
- How many are there?
- It's all I can do.

952
00:57:03,640 --> 00:57:06,350
We have eight. Just one more.

953
00:57:06,350 --> 00:57:09,490
Okay. Dong Woon!

954
00:57:09,490 --> 00:57:18,070
Okay, go in! Hurry, go!

955
00:57:18,070 --> 00:57:24,970
- Go in!
- No, keep them out!

956
00:57:27,940 --> 00:57:30,240
- Let go!
- You can't do that.

957
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:31,830
Go away.

958
00:57:34,660 --> 00:57:36,880
Who was it?

959
00:57:37,450 --> 00:57:43,000
[First she was robbed, now
she's hurled away.]

960
00:57:44,230 --> 00:57:47,110
[Big-nosed brother also hurled away.]

961
00:57:47,990 --> 00:57:51,160
[Go Soo has closed the door!]

962
00:57:52,780 --> 00:57:56,810
Guys! Go Soo! Just find one
and then let me know.

963
00:58:00,390 --> 00:58:03,710
We were good for a couple of months.

964
00:58:04,670 --> 00:58:07,490
[Ignores her]

965
00:58:10,070 --> 00:58:15,770
[Haha has come to take the last cabbage.]

966
00:58:23,370 --> 00:58:25,840
Get in. You're dead.

967
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:30,070
[No wonder Jae Suk let him in.]

968
00:58:33,780 --> 00:58:36,490
I've waited for this moment.

969
00:58:36,490 --> 00:58:39,720
[This was his chance to steal
the cabbage.]

970
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:43,590
- I said be quiet.
- Jong Kook! Jong Kook!

971
00:58:47,210 --> 00:58:49,110
- Let me get out. I'm sorry.
- Really?

972
00:58:49,110 --> 00:58:51,760
- Promise me something.
- What?

973
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:54,630
- Don't come back in here. Promise.
- I promise.

974
00:58:56,750 --> 00:59:00,870
[Hmm? The giraffe arrives.]

975
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:09,020
[The giraffe's method of taking
the cabbage.]

976
00:59:09,020 --> 00:59:11,190
Give it here.

977
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:17,740
Suk Jin! Suk Jin!
You can't leave either.

978
00:59:22,580 --> 00:59:26,420
You two are stuck here.

979
00:59:27,890 --> 00:59:28,520
[He just needs two more.]

980
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:32,190
It's a touchdown.
No! No!

981
00:59:32,190 --> 00:59:34,870
[Hyo Joo takes it right under his nose.]

982
00:59:34,870 --> 00:59:39,100
All we need is one more.

983
00:59:40,190 --> 00:59:42,050
Hurry, hurry.

984
00:59:42,670 --> 00:59:45,250
Behind you! Throw it!

985
00:59:45,250 --> 00:59:47,890
- Suk Jin...
- Kwang Soo...

986
00:59:51,410 --> 00:59:55,750
Jae Suk, one more person!

987
00:59:57,050 --> 00:59:59,400
What kind of jail is this?

988
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:03,070
[Now that they're locked up,
look for the cabbage.]

989
01:00:05,140 --> 01:00:07,880
[At this moment, Go Soo arrives.]

990
01:00:14,220 --> 01:00:16,470
It's Go Soo!

991
01:00:16,470 --> 01:00:19,800
[Ha Ha tries to hand off a cabbage.]

992
01:00:26,830 --> 01:00:30,950
[Go Soo catches it!]

993
01:00:32,700 --> 01:00:34,960
No, no, no.

994
01:00:37,620 --> 01:00:41,180
[The unstoppable blue team wins!]

995
01:00:41,180 --> 01:00:45,750
Jong Kook, open the door.
Open.

996
01:00:58,220 --> 01:01:01,280
[A war breaks out over a cabbage.]

997
01:01:01,550 --> 01:01:03,330
Why aren't you even ticklish?

998
01:01:03,330 --> 01:01:08,300
- Hang onto it Go Soo. Hang on.
- Okay.

999
01:01:08,300 --> 01:01:10,790
- Just hang onto it.
- Jong Kook. Please.

1000
01:01:10,790 --> 01:01:12,710
- Just hang on.
- Come out.

1001
01:01:12,710 --> 01:01:15,680
No. Just hang onto it. Just hang on.

1002
01:01:17,150 --> 01:01:20,200
Hold on, hold on.

1003
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:25,750
What is this?

1004
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:32,570
- Go Soo, did they take it?
- The cabbage ripped in half.

1005
01:01:32,570 --> 01:01:35,500
A ripped cabbage is not valid.

1006
01:01:41,540 --> 01:01:45,150
Run Kwang Soo!

1007
01:01:47,310 --> 01:01:51,220
[Blue and Yellow Teams need
one more cabbage.]

1008
01:01:51,220 --> 01:01:54,590
Take it, take it.

1009
01:01:54,590 --> 01:01:59,440
[Ha Ha has left with a cabbage.]

1010
01:02:02,280 --> 01:02:05,830
[Kwang Soo escapes with a cabbage!]

1011
01:02:08,080 --> 01:02:12,320
[Running to headquarters]

1012
01:02:12,320 --> 01:02:14,590
[Hyo Joo gets in the way.]
Director Young!

1013
01:02:16,300 --> 01:02:18,320
[The time is now!]

1014
01:02:18,320 --> 01:02:21,720
- Throw it here.
- I got it, just go.

1015
01:02:23,220 --> 01:02:25,620
- Three!
- Hurry. We got it.

1016
01:02:25,620 --> 01:02:28,060
- The cabbage!
- Hurry up.

1017
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:31,540
We're ready! We got it!

1018
01:02:34,990 --> 01:02:37,780
The last one! That's ten!

1019
01:02:38,370 --> 01:02:41,510

You can't shake the water off there!

1187
01:14:14,040 --> 01:14:16,340
What are you doing?

1188
01:14:16,340 --> 01:14:19,810
I'll give you 2000 won,
go over there to play with the kids.

1189
01:14:19,810 --> 01:14:23,610
[That's what Kim Chang Jul's mother
always told him!]

1190
01:14:23,610 --> 01:14:27,780
- Go over there. Go!
- I'm making kimchi right now.

1191
01:14:27,780 --> 01:14:29,720
You fool.

1192
01:14:29,720 --> 01:14:37,000
Go and play with your friends.
Why of all days are you hanging around here...

1193
01:14:38,990 --> 01:14:43,200
- This is too much.
- Oh seriously.

1194
01:14:43,200 --> 01:14:46,300
Why are you acting like such a baby?

1195
01:14:47,780 --> 01:14:51,510
[What is he trying to do with the scissors?]

1196
01:14:53,050 --> 01:14:54,880
What are you doing?

1197
01:15:00,050 --> 01:15:05,240
[A heart?]

1198
01:15:06,610 --> 01:15:08,620
Hyo Joo, are you eating that?

1199
01:15:08,620 --> 01:15:11,110
It's a heart!
Don't eat it.

1200
01:15:11,110 --> 01:15:14,250
Do you eat everything people
bring you?

1201
01:15:14,250 --> 01:15:15,730
Why did you eat that?

1202
01:15:15,730 --> 01:15:18,490
Hyo Joo, why did you eat that?

1203
01:15:18,490 --> 01:15:20,190
What did you do?

1204
01:15:20,190 --> 01:15:22,350
- Ah, it's salty.
- Aren't you supposed to eat that?

1205
01:15:26,410 --> 01:15:29,080
[Finally, the ingredients are all prepped.]

1206
01:15:29,160 --> 01:15:31,370
We need one more.

1207
01:15:39,740 --> 01:15:45,470
For the time being...Gary.
Gary.

1208
01:15:51,790 --> 01:15:54,540
[Mixing, mixing]

1209
01:16:01,250 --> 01:16:03,960
Just put it all in here and mix it all.

1210
01:16:04,530 --> 01:16:08,420
- Then we put the seasoning.
- Red pepper first.

1211
01:16:08,420 --> 01:16:11,300
I don't think so.

1212
01:16:11,300 --> 01:16:13,250
It's okay. Just put this in.

1213
01:16:13,650 --> 01:16:16,670
- It doesn't matter.
- Gary bring the red pepper powder.

1214
01:16:19,270 --> 01:16:22,010
That's how they did it?

1215
01:16:22,590 --> 01:16:27,700
- I don't think is how we do it.
- No, it's fine. It's just that...

1216
01:16:27,700 --> 01:16:28,990
Just leave that there.

1217
01:16:28,990 --> 01:16:30,790
Give me the glutinous rice.

1218
01:16:30,920 --> 01:16:33,820
Take the red pepper powder and mix.

1219
01:16:33,820 --> 01:16:35,420
How much red pepper powder?

1220
01:16:35,980 --> 01:16:37,730
Let's just put some in for now.

1221
01:16:39,320 --> 01:16:42,870
- I think we can put in more.
- If you put it in, the color...

1222
01:16:42,870 --> 01:16:45,080
- Don't we have to put more in?
- Yes, put more.

1223
01:16:45,080 --> 01:16:46,780
Put in a lot more.

1224
01:16:47,230 --> 01:16:52,810
I'm sorry!
Sorry!

1225
01:16:53,860 --> 01:16:57,390
I'm going to put in the red pepper powder.
Okay. Hurry!

1226
01:16:57,630 --> 01:17:00,800
- Why are you keep copying us?
- Don't be so mindless.

1227
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:04,250
We know what we're doing.
This is our method.

1228
01:17:05,560 --> 01:17:10,380
We remember. We're using this
based on what we remember.

1229
01:17:14,060 --> 01:17:18,010
Look, they're putting in the sprouts.

1230
01:17:19,820 --> 01:17:22,290
It doesn't matter.

1231
01:17:23,310 --> 01:17:26,280
You can put it in.
Put it in.

1232
01:17:28,270 --> 01:17:30,810
- See, it's finding it's color.
- What is that? What?

1233
01:17:30,810 --> 01:17:34,890
- Give me the light brown thing.
- What do you mean light brown?

1234
01:17:34,890 --> 01:17:36,940
Hey, take care of the seasoning.

1235
01:17:37,480 --> 01:17:39,540
You put in the garlic, right?

1236
01:17:39,540 --> 01:17:41,310
Yeah, we put it in.

1237
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,250
- You smell it right?
- I can smell it.

1238
01:17:44,250 --> 01:17:46,150
It's here, it's here.

1239
01:17:47,170 --> 01:17:49,660
Put that in.
Put it in. Put it in.

1240
01:17:50,780 --> 01:17:56,720
There. Just put it in.
Just cut it all up. All of it.

1241
01:18:00,580 --> 01:18:04,010
I think it's a little bland.
There's too much.

1242
01:18:04,010 --> 01:18:07,480
What are you trying to make?

1243
01:18:07,480 --> 01:18:10,870
These big ones? You have
to cut it up smaller.

1244
01:18:19,570 --> 01:18:22,400
Something's missing.

1245
01:18:23,030 --> 01:18:26,950
[What ultimately
is missing from the kimchi?]

1246
01:18:27,520 --> 01:18:31,050
The reason it has to be a bit salty is...

1247
01:18:31,050 --> 01:18:36,150
If the cabbage goes in,
it'll make it a bit bland.

1248
01:18:36,150 --> 01:18:38,840
We need to season it well.

1249
01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:42,320
That's why at first, it tastes a bit bland.

1250
01:18:45,880 --> 01:18:47,790
Hey!

1251
01:18:50,190 --> 01:18:53,300
What is that?
What are you doing?

1252
01:18:53,300 --> 01:18:56,180
- We're going to eat it.
- This is awesome!

1253
01:18:56,180 --> 01:18:58,530
How can you put in soda?

1254
01:18:59,200 --> 01:19:01,180
- Soda?
- Why put in soda?

1255
01:19:01,180 --> 01:19:03,360
Let's all protest this!

1256
01:19:03,760 --> 01:19:06,960
They can't put in soda!

1257
01:19:06,960 --> 01:19:12,000
- We didn't put it in.
- Might as well buy kimchi from the market.

1258
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:15,490
- That's soda.
- Yeah, for us to drink.

1259
01:19:16,250 --> 01:19:23,390
I was just going to take a sip
because I was thirsty from making kimchi.

1260
01:19:23,390 --> 01:19:25,090
We won't put it in.

1261
01:19:25,090 --> 01:19:27,870
Drink water. I'll give you water.

1262
01:19:28,450 --> 01:19:31,220
It's so violent here.

1263
01:19:31,220 --> 01:19:35,040
- Let's confirm that they won't.
- We won't put it in.

1264

[Hands over soda to staff.]

1265

[Gives up on soda and reconvenes
for new plan.]

1266

Hey Kwang Soo.

1267
01:19:50,780 --> 01:19:53,870
Hey! Are you crazy?
What are you doing?

1268
01:19:54,450 --> 01:19:57,880
- What are you doing?
- Don't put it in!

1269

- Hey, hey, hey.
- Yeah, I bet it'll be delicious.

1270
01:20:03,980 --> 01:20:06,360
You're not supposed to put in that much.

1271
01:20:08,710 --> 01:20:11,870
Just put in a little.

1272
01:20:12,470 --> 01:20:15,430
Give us the rest.

1273
01:20:28,540 --> 01:20:31,970
Taste it.

1274
01:20:31,970 --> 01:20:34,070
Why is it so salty?

1275
01:20:35,930 --> 01:20:37,710
Let's do it. Give it.

1276
01:20:38,190 --> 01:20:43,710
[Finally mizing the oyster sauce
with the cabbage.]

1277
01:20:45,400 --> 01:20:50,210
Since it's not ripe, it's really
all about seasoning.

1278
01:20:51,430 --> 01:20:55,040
Put all the flavor into the
cabbage leaves.

1279
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:59,270
Hyo Joo's good at this.

1280
01:20:59,270 --> 01:21:03,870
- Then you have to press down the cabbage.
- Ah, I forgot to press it down.

1281
01:21:14,240 --> 01:21:19,000
- Put it in like this.
- Wow, this is the real deal.

1282
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:22,690
We have to do this right.

1283

[Must snack now and then.]

1284
01:21:33,340 --> 01:21:35,580
- How is it?
- How is it? Really?

1285

It's good! It's good!

1287
01:21:41,450 --> 01:21:43,830
Hyo Joo, you really are the daughter
of kimchi makers.

1288
01:21:43,830 --> 01:21:47,630
- Hyo Joo's family really makes kimchi.
- Really?

1289
01:21:47,630 --> 01:21:49,300
- Is it really good?
- Yeah.

- Here, try some.

It's salty.

1298

- It's salty?
- It can't be salty.

is meant to be a bit salty, right?

01:27:37,050 --> 01:27:39,130
I can't eat it.

1354
01:27:44,730 --> 01:27:48,930
It's all good.
I think the first one is Ji Ho's.

1355
01:27:49,620 --> 01:27:52,010
It's a bit salty.

1356
01:27:52,010 --> 01:27:54,360
This one's different.

1357
01:27:54,360 --> 01:27:56,900
With rice, number two tastes good.

1358
01:27:56,900 --> 01:27:58,850
But just the kimchi, the first
one tastes best.

1359
01:28:05,450 --> 01:28:07,610
I have no idea.

1360
01:28:07,610 --> 01:28:11,590
- We'll just go, go, go.
- I'll just eat. Nothing else.

1361
01:28:11,590 --> 01:28:15,080
All I have to do is taste it to know.
Just go. I'll know.

1362
01:28:15,520 --> 01:28:18,370
I think this is our kimchi.

1363
01:28:18,370 --> 01:28:20,600
There's no replusion.

1364
01:28:20,600 --> 01:28:23,230
Tastes different each time
I have the meat.

1365
01:28:25,590 --> 01:28:28,360
I have no idea.

1366
01:28:28,860 --> 01:28:32,710
Jong Kook! Stop!
I'm really sick of this!

1367
01:28:33,270 --> 01:28:37,130
I really think this is ours.

1368
01:28:37,130 --> 01:28:39,660
Did we really make this?

1369
01:28:39,660 --> 01:28:42,200
It's all good.
I think all three are good.

1370
01:28:47,220 --> 01:28:49,970
This one's realy not good.

1371
01:28:49,970 --> 01:28:52,170
Who made this one?

1372
01:28:52,170 --> 01:28:55,090
I waited an hour to eat this.

1373
01:28:55,090 --> 01:28:58,260
They just eat and choose.
What takes so long?

1374
01:28:59,810 --> 01:29:01,700
This one's really bad.

1375
01:29:01,700 --> 01:29:03,660
Really bad.

1376
01:29:09,440 --> 01:29:14,110
- The first dish...
- Who's was it? It was ours, right?

1377
01:29:14,640 --> 01:29:17,420
The first one is the yellow team.

1378
01:29:17,420 --> 01:29:19,670
Second one is blue team.

1379
01:29:19,670 --> 01:29:22,720
Third one is purple team.

1380
01:29:22,720 --> 01:29:26,690
The second dish was good.
I thought I was going crazy.

1381
01:29:26,690 --> 01:29:28,580
The meat was the best.

1382
01:29:28,790 --> 01:29:31,550
I couldn't eat the second one.

1383
01:29:33,340 --> 01:29:36,430
[First ballot: 2]

1384
01:29:44,480 --> 01:29:46,970
Third team.

1385
01:29:47,310 --> 01:29:51,530
- I really couldn't eat the third one.
- Third one was really bad.

1386
01:29:52,720 --> 01:29:54,700
Second team.

1387
01:29:55,080 --> 01:29:57,860
- It was the soda.
- It's the soda.

1388
01:29:59,770 --> 01:30:02,590
- Third team.
- Yeah, third team!

1389
01:30:02,590 --> 01:30:07,000
- I really couldn't eat the third dish.
- But it was unique.

1390
01:30:09,930 --> 01:30:12,130
Second team.

1391
01:30:12,810 --> 01:30:15,180
It was the soda.

1392
01:30:15,180 --> 01:30:17,890
Does our team not come up?

1393
01:30:21,270 --> 01:30:24,320
- First team.
- Yes!

1394
01:30:26,190 --> 01:30:29,330
You must be crazy.

1395
01:30:29,330 --> 01:30:32,450
- Was the first dish good?
- I thought it was.

1396
01:30:32,450 --> 01:30:35,240
First dish.

1397
01:30:35,860 --> 01:30:42,200
I thought the first dish had something,
but it wasn't good.

1398
01:30:42,200 --> 01:30:45,360
First team.

1399
01:30:45,360 --> 01:30:49,600
- Awesome!
- That's ridiculous!

1400
01:30:49,600 --> 01:30:51,920
What's the tally?

1401
01:30:51,920 --> 01:30:54,790
It's 3:2.

1402
01:30:56,580 --> 01:30:59,270
- Please, please.
- It should be us.

1403
01:30:59,270 --> 01:31:03,350
- Number one! Number one!
- Please!

1404
01:31:03,350 --> 01:31:12,380
- Number one!
- Number two!

1405
01:31:14,830 --> 01:31:18,730
[And the winner is...
number one]

1406
01:31:23,780 --> 01:31:28,990
[The winner of the kimchi making race
is the yellow team!]

1407
01:31:28,990 --> 01:31:32,970
- Number one!
- We won Kwang Soo!

1408
01:31:33,590 --> 01:31:35,180
[As if they won an award
at a ceremony.]

1409
01:31:35,180 --> 01:31:39,890
- It's because you voted.
- Still, Hyo Joo's team got last place.

1410
01:31:40,430 --> 01:31:43,180
- But our kimchi was good.
- It was good.

1411
01:31:43,180 --> 01:31:46,120
Wow, we take all of this.

1412
01:31:46,120 --> 01:31:48,360
Let's grill this and eat it.

1413
01:31:48,360 --> 01:31:51,480
Wow, let's eat it!
Meat party!

1414
01:31:51,480 --> 01:31:55,570
- Meat party! Kalbi!
- Just give it to Go Soo.

1415
01:31:55,570 --> 01:31:59,530
- Give it to Go Soo. Hurry.
- Don't hog it all.

1416
01:31:59,530 --> 01:32:02,080
Then what was the point of
this contest?

1417
01:32:02,080 --> 01:32:04,770
Let's just go. Go.

1418
01:32:04,770 --> 01:32:07,290
Hey Go Soo! Buy it yourself.

1419
01:32:08,980 --> 01:32:11,620
Don't take Ji Hyo's.

1420
01:32:12,210 --> 01:32:17,240
- Don't take it.
- Hey what is this?

1421
01:32:17,240 --> 01:32:19,470
You're just taking it?

1422
01:32:19,470 --> 01:32:21,430
Hey guys, take what's yours.

1423
01:32:22,850 --> 01:32:24,960
Go. We're going!

1424
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:28,620
We're leaving!

1425
01:32:28,650 --> 01:32:31,650
We'll enjoy the meat!
Thank you!

1426
01:32:31,650 --> 01:32:34,080
It's going to be scary delicious!

1427
01:32:34,080 --> 01:32:36,160
They didn't give us any.

1428
01:32:37,870 --> 01:32:45,560
It's beautiful!

1429
01:32:45,560 --> 01:32:48,690
- It's beautiful...
- A man's voice came out.

1430
01:32:49,250 --> 01:32:51,940
I am the king of Joseon!

1431
01:32:52,470 --> 01:32:54,990
- How could you do this!
- Do as I order!

1432
01:32:57,090 --> 01:32:59,070
I said look at me!

1433
01:33:08,770 --> 01:33:11,720
- At your command.
- I don't want to be king!

1434
01:33:12,330 --> 01:33:16,500
Cast a vote. Depending on the result,
the king will change.

1435
01:33:16,500 --> 01:33:18,830
That means I can be king.

1436
01:33:18,970 --> 01:33:24,130
[Who will protect their throne?]

1437
01:33:24,980 --> 01:33:27,550
What kind of king are you?

1438
01:33:29,780 --> 01:33:32,740
I'm the king.
