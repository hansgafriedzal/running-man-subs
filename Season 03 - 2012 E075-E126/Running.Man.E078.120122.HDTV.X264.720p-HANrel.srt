1
00:00:14,198 --> 00:00:15,599
Let's go!!

2
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,368
Let's have a showdown!

3
00:00:21,238 --> 00:00:22,473
Hey!

4
00:00:22,473 --> 00:00:23,541
Quickly!

5
00:00:23,541 --> 00:00:24,775
If we want to stop them...

6
00:00:24,775 --> 00:00:25,710
No!

7
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:26,911
What we need now is,

8
00:00:26,911 --> 00:00:29,013
Quickly, stop him! Stop him!

9
00:00:29,013 --> 00:00:31,349
I must eliminate them ail.

10
00:00:33,851 --> 00:00:38,022
It's 2012. The year of the dragon has started. We're wishing everyone...

11
00:00:38,022 --> 00:00:41,926
Happy New Year!

12
00:00:44,228 --> 00:00:49,967
Hey, after doing this, immediately everybody bends over on the ground.

13
00:00:49,967 --> 00:00:52,703
Currently our viewers are celebrating the new year.

14
00:00:52,703 --> 00:00:54,939
Actually we should dig a hole in the ground first before bowing.

15
00:00:54,939 --> 00:00:58,509
- Hey, HaHa seems very prepared to be funny today. -Why, why why?

16
00:00:58,509 --> 00:00:59,710
Your hairstyle! Hairstyle!

17
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:01,345
About that... Why did you perm your hair?

18
00:01:01,345 --> 00:01:03,647
-No, it's only just a new image. -We are not interested.

19
00:01:03,647 --> 00:01:04,782
What? Didn't you ask me?

20
00:01:04,782 --> 00:01:06,550
Hyung!Hyung!

21
00:01:06,951 --> 00:01:10,521
It's because Yoo Jae Suk hyung keeps copying me, so I wanted to have a new style.

22
00:01:10,521 --> 00:01:12,223
Ah really, I am going crazy.

23
00:01:12,223 --> 00:01:14,058
Look, isn’t he still copying me now?

24
00:01:14,058 --> 00:01:16,727
Next week you'll also come with your hair permed!

25
00:01:16,727 --> 00:01:18,863
If this hyung does perm his hair, it‘s really look very funny.

26
00:01:18,863 --> 00:01:19,330
Really.

27
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:21,365
Why don't we perm our hair together? Together...

28
00:01:21,365 --> 00:01:25,903
-Jae Silk oppa's hair, wearing HaHaioppa's glasses. That... -Shall we make this the punishment hairstyle?

29
00:01:25,903 --> 00:01:27,638
Try wearing it now. Now!

30
00:01:27,638 --> 00:01:28,706
-No, no thanks. -Just try wearing it once.

31
00:01:28,706 --> 00:01:31,142
Isn't it just changing glasses?

32
00:01:31,142 --> 00:01:33,277
- Just try it. -That... This isn't very difficult.

33
00:01:33,277 --> 00:01:34,745
I can never wear this again, this.

34
00:01:41,452 --> 00:01:43,721
Cute! Cute!

35
00:01:52,396 --> 00:01:54,398
How did your eyes turn out to be like this?

36
00:01:54,765 --> 00:01:56,667
How did your eyes turn out to be like this?

37
00:01:56,667 --> 00:01:57,701
No, what's wrong?

38
00:01:57,701 --> 00:01:59,637
I knew it would be like this.

39
00:01:59,637 --> 00:02:02,506
Which is why I said only my own glasses are suitable for me.

40
00:02:03,841 --> 00:02:05,109
This is really hilarious.

41
00:02:05,109 --> 00:02:07,845
No, isn't it New Year's today?

42
00:02:07,845 --> 00:02:09,280
Last year. Year 2011...

43
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:09,680
Yes.

44
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:12,216
Once again, we want to express our gratitude towards our viewers.

45
00:02:12,216 --> 00:02:14,785
- That's right, we are really very grateful. . -This year, we will work even harder!

46
00:02:14,785 --> 00:02:15,352
Yes!

47
00:02:15,352 --> 00:02:16,187
We will work even harder on the show.

48
00:02:16,187 --> 00:02:18,923
Congratulations on the Daesang award.

49
00:02:20,357 --> 00:02:23,627
-We-sho'uldhave received it together. -Also, that... Ji Hyo also...

50
00:02:23,627 --> 00:02:26,797
We all went through the same hardships, why didn't we all receive?

51
00:02:26,797 --> 00:02:28,232
Congratulations to you.

52
00:02:28,232 --> 00:02:30,901
Congratulations to all of you... HaHa as well.

53
00:02:34,538 --> 00:02:36,707
Hyung! Let's turn around too! Let's turn around too!

54
00:02:36,707 --> 00:02:39,043
Let's turn around too! Let's turn around too!

55
00:02:39,043 --> 00:02:41,378
We have also went through hardships!

56
00:02:43,447 --> 00:02:51,622
Like you have mentioned, last year all 7 of you went through the same hardships.

57
00:02:51,622 --> 00:02:55,226
For the anke of JI Suk Jin and Gary, who did not manage to get an award.

58
00:02:55,226 --> 00:02:58,129
We have prepared our own award for you.

59
00:02:58,129 --> 00:02:59,029
Thank you.

60
00:02:59,029 --> 00:03:02,399
- Now, we will invite presenters to give the prizes. -Ah, there are award presenters?

61
00:03:05,503 --> 00:03:06,570
Hello.

62
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:08,105
Ah, Lee Beom Soo and Hong Soo Hyun.

63
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:09,940
That's great, that's great.

64
00:03:15,813 --> 00:03:16,881
Oh my god.

65
00:03:16,881 --> 00:03:19,016
Hey, you stand over that side.

66
00:03:19,016 --> 00:03:21,152
Hey! You really...

67
00:03:21,152 --> 00:03:23,687
Do you like Hong Soo Hyun a lot now?

68
00:03:23,687 --> 00:03:27,958
Today's guests are Lee Beom Soo and Hong Soo Hyun.

69
00:03:33,764 --> 00:03:38,068
It is said that you will run into your worst enemy at the worst time and place.

70
00:03:38,068 --> 00:03:39,470
Wake up!

71
00:03:42,907 --> 00:03:47,978
This is my first time doing an outdoor prize presentation for a show.

72
00:03:47,978 --> 00:03:52,082
I will not say anything special.

73
00:03:52,082 --> 00:03:55,419
Why is this prize presentation conducted outdoors?

74
00:03:55,419 --> 00:03:59,657
- Because it's too cold, we will immediately announce the results. -Yes, yes, yes.

75
00:03:59,657 --> 00:04:01,725
SBS's Performing Arts Daesang for this year.

76
00:04:01,725 --> 00:04:03,427
Soo Hyun will be announcing.

77
00:04:03,427 --> 00:04:05,829
There is no need for that. Senior, you shall announce.

78
00:04:06,964 --> 00:04:08,432
That's really modest.

79
00:04:08,432 --> 00:04:11,202
-You are making us all so nervous. -It almost scared me, really!

80
00:04:11,202 --> 00:04:13,671
Then, shall I be the one to deliver?

81
00:04:17,908 --> 00:04:18,976
Yes.

82
00:04:20,511 --> 00:04:22,947
SBS's Performing Arts Daesang for this year.

83
00:04:22,947 --> 00:04:24,248
Ah, I’m really nervous.

84
00:04:24,248 --> 00:04:26,116
Running Man's...

85
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:31,722
Ji Suk Jin and Gary. Congratulations!

86
00:04:31,722 --> 00:04:34,258
-You got the award! You got the award! -Me?

87
00:04:34,258 --> 00:04:36,026
I didn't hear it clearly. What did you say?

88
00:04:36,026 --> 00:04:37,428
Is it really me?

89
00:04:37,428 --> 00:04:41,065
Who would have such unnatural expression?

90
00:04:41,832 --> 00:04:43,467
This year's Daesang.

91
00:04:43,467 --> 00:04:46,370
Wow, it's the Daesang! Daesang!

92
00:04:48,505 --> 00:04:51,609
Really, even the flowers are sent by our authors.

93
00:04:53,277 --> 00:04:55,512
Good! Now let us listen to the winners' speeches.

94
00:04:55,512 --> 00:04:58,115
-Firstly, how do I say it... -Thank you everyone.

95
00:04:58,115 --> 00:05:02,920
-First, we received the prize from Beom Soo and Hong Soo Hyun. -Yes, Hong Soo Hyun,

96
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,623
Yes, because this is live now, so...

97
00:05:09,026 --> 00:05:11,829
This year we even rode a boat. We did everything!

98
00:05:11,829 --> 00:05:14,098
Ok, please give the two of them a round of applause.

99
00:05:14,098 --> 00:05:20,971
It's a new year, and I will really, really work harder.

100
00:05:20,971 --> 00:05:23,040
The path which we must take is still very long.

101
00:05:23,841 --> 00:05:25,643
-It has already ended. -Ah. it has?

102
00:05:25,643 --> 00:05:28,646
Firstly, we have to invite the two guests to the centre.

103
00:05:28,646 --> 00:05:30,881
Hyung, we should invite them to the centre.

104
00:05:30,881 --> 00:05:33,150
That... it has already...

105
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:35,219
Usually isn't it the prize winners who get to stand in the centre? Isn't it?

106
00:05:35,219 --> 00:05:37,621
Why are you so stubborn about the centre?

107
00:05:37,621 --> 00:05:41,058
No. these two are also very busy. We still have a recording to do with them today.

108
00:05:41,058 --> 00:05:45,596
Today will be Cho Han Ji's race to conquer the world.

109
00:05:46,397 --> 00:05:49,166
After splitting into teams. first we will curry out the frontier battle.

110
00:05:49,166 --> 00:05:50,301
Let's go!!

111
00:05:50,301 --> 00:05:52,069
See you at the frontier battle!

112
00:05:52,069 --> 00:05:53,137
Then it will be the reconnaissance battle.

113
00:05:53,137 --> 00:05:54,071
Don't you have that?

114
00:05:54,071 --> 00:05:54,872
Just kill me!

115
00:05:54,872 --> 00:05:56,440
Didn't you ask me to introduce her to you?

116
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,241
Me?

117
00:05:57,241 --> 00:05:58,475
Lastly. world war.

118
00:05:58,475 --> 00:06:00,010
Faster! Hey kids!

119
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:01,245
Stop Beom Soo hyung!

120
00:06:01,245 --> 00:06:02,046
No!!

121
00:06:02,046 --> 00:06:03,480
Please... Really.

122
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:07,051
-And the final team which conquers the world.. -This time the scale is very big.

123
00:06:07,051 --> 00:06:08,185
That's right.

124
00:06:08,185 --> 00:06:11,622
-Will he this episode's race winner. -Although I interrupt you every time you speak.

125
00:06:11,622 --> 00:06:14,758
But there are still some friends who don't understand what is Cho Han Ji is.

126
00:06:17,127 --> 00:06:18,762
That's right, that's right.

127
00:06:18,762 --> 00:06:21,799
I am at least a little more knowledgeable than Mong Ji

128
00:06:22,099 --> 00:06:23,801
Why? Why?

129
00:06:24,535 --> 00:06:28,072
-Maybe they thought it is related to window papers. -Window papers...

130
00:06:34,411 --> 00:06:38,148
-Cho's overlord Hang Woo is Kim Jong Kook. -That's right!

131
00:06:38,148 --> 00:06:39,850
Leader, that's right!

132
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:43,887
Han's overlord Yoo Bang is Lee Beom See.

133
00:06:58,435 --> 00:07:00,037
This, this, this, this,

134
00:07:00,037 --> 00:07:05,943
You people who are immediately going on the battlefield, what clothes are you wearing?

135
00:07:05,943 --> 00:07:08,712
-And even wearing a hat! Look at that curly hair! Really.. -What's wrong with curly hair?

136
00:07:08,712 --> 00:07:10,981
Let‘s meet in the battle fight!

137
00:07:10,981 --> 00:07:12,449
By then, don’t be afraid!

138
00:07:12,449 --> 00:07:14,685
What is "meeting in the battle fight"?

139
00:07:14,685 --> 00:07:16,920
It's not "meeting in the battle fight", it's "meeting in the battlefield".

140
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:19,256
This is just a variety show, why are you shouting your throat out like this?

141
00:07:19,256 --> 00:07:20,858
Just wait for your death!

142
00:07:20,858 --> 00:07:22,459
Weekly?

143
00:07:22,826 --> 00:07:25,396
Just wait for your death in the hattle!

144
00:07:25,396 --> 00:07:27,498
Then, we will begin the hattle now.

145
00:07:27,498 --> 00:07:31,001
-The winning team can choose a member from the opposite team.. -That＊s good, that's good!

146
00:07:31,001 --> 00:07:33,270
-To cast away. -That's right.

147
00:07:35,572 --> 00:07:40,611
-How can you do this? -If it's like this, it will definitely he me on this side!

148
00:07:40,611 --> 00:07:41,812
Hyung! Don't cast me away!

149
00:07:41,812 --> 00:07:44,148
We cannot lose!

150
00:07:54,558 --> 00:07:57,027
Can you see the hay over there?

151
00:07:57,027 --> 00:07:59,663
You must run there quickly, as fast as possible.

152
00:08:08,539 --> 00:08:11,608
-Following the chess board, the red flag represents Hun. -Ah, Cho Han Ji is chess?

153
00:08:11,608 --> 00:08:13,010
No... It’s not  like this...

154
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:16,680
Don't we have to write Cho and Han on the chess board?

155
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:19,049
I didn't even know there was a Cho.

156
00:08:19,983 --> 00:08:22,853
-Isn't Cho blue in colour? -Right.

157
00:08:22,853 --> 00:08:26,857
Ok, if you guys go quickly, you will know what to do next.

158
00:08:26,857 --> 00:08:29,026
When everybody has ranched, please verify.

159
00:08:29,026 --> 00:08:31,061
-Ok. set off! -Let's go!

160
00:08:42,873 --> 00:08:45,142
Here, here, here!

161
00:08:45,142 --> 00:08:46,243
Is it here?

162
00:08:46,243 --> 00:08:49,213
Oh my god, must we read this?

163
00:08:49,213 --> 00:08:54,451
Find your country's flag in the heap of hay and hang it in front of your opponent's camp.

164
00:08:54,451 --> 00:08:56,753
Must find the flag in the heap of hay! Flag!

165
00:08:56,753 --> 00:08:59,056
Quickly, quickly!

166
00:09:01,758 --> 00:09:03,727
-Do we do it like this? -Where is the flag?

167
00:09:03,727 --> 00:09:05,729
There's no flag.

168
00:09:08,065 --> 00:09:10,701
-Hey! Hey! -Ahhh!!

169
00:09:14,605 --> 00:09:16,273
There isn't any...

170
00:09:16,273 --> 00:09:18,108
Lee Beom Soo is the best!

171
00:09:21,745 --> 00:09:24,081
This is the best!

172
00:09:25,849 --> 00:09:27,885
Here! Here!

173
00:09:33,524 --> 00:09:35,959
Hyung, grab him!

174
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:41,098
Hey! Hey!

175
00:09:50,574 --> 00:09:52,042
Kwang Soo. what are you doing?

176
00:09:52,042 --> 00:09:53,644
Kwang Soo, grab hold quickly!

177
00:09:53,744 --> 00:09:55,812
Oh, why are you doing this?

178
00:09:55,812 --> 00:09:57,514
Look for it, quick!

179
00:09:57,614 --> 00:09:59,550
Where should I look?

180
00:10:00,183 --> 00:10:02,386
Hey! What are you doing?

181
00:10:02,386 --> 00:10:04,755
-Hey! We lifted Kim Jong Kook up! -What are you doing?

182
00:10:07,324 --> 00:10:10,227
Set the flag up, quick!,

183
00:10:14,031 --> 00:10:16,266
This is the first time feeling like this!

184
00:10:18,201 --> 00:10:19,836
Take a picture!

185
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:23,974
Take a picture!

186
00:10:30,914 --> 00:10:32,616
It's over there!

187
00:10:38,288 --> 00:10:40,424
No! No!

188
00:10:47,264 --> 00:10:48,665
Hey! Kim Jong Kook!

189
00:10:49,132 --> 00:10:49,866
Hyung!

190
00:10:49,866 --> 00:10:51,401
Why are you doing this to me?

191
00:10:51,535 --> 00:10:53,136
Ah, Soo Hyun!

192
00:10:53,136 --> 00:10:54,905
Soo Hyun, wait a minute!

193
00:10:58,675 --> 00:11:00,110
You can't do that.

194
00:11:00,377 --> 00:11:01,878
Oppa, hurry!

195
00:11:02,713 --> 00:11:04,581
Quickly guard me!

196
00:11:13,457 --> 00:11:14,858
Move aside!

197
00:11:16,126 --> 00:11:17,728
Move aside!

198
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:24,468
We won!

199
00:11:25,135 --> 00:11:27,537
-They've got it wrong. -Why? Why?

200
00:11:31,208 --> 00:11:33,043
It's upside down!

201
00:11:39,683 --> 00:11:42,319
Quick, hit the drum! Ji hyo!

202
00:11:42,552 --> 00:11:45,222
Yeah!

203
00:11:50,527 --> 00:11:52,162
I can't read Hanja characters.

204
00:11:54,097 --> 00:11:58,301
-I already said you have to have knowledge about Cho Han Ji. - How can you be so clueless!

205
00:11:58,335 --> 00:12:02,906
No, why. Can't you read it like this?

206
00:12:04,207 --> 00:12:06,610
-Ehem, so tired. -Soo Hyun.

207
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:09,346
Was it Soo Hyun? *Cough cough!* Aiyoo. I'm so tired.

208
00:12:11,982 --> 00:12:13,950
* cough cough*, I'm so tired.

209
00:12:15,886 --> 00:12:20,624
Because  Chu lost, please discuss who to eliminate.

210
00:12:20,724 --> 00:12:21,758
You've worked hard!

211
00:12:23,126 --> 00:12:24,661
Ah, really.

212
00:12:25,328 --> 00:12:27,998
Do you feel apologetic to your team?

213
00:12:28,131 --> 00:12:30,133
Hey, you really.

214
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:31,835
Why is he like that?

215
00:12:32,169 --> 00:12:34,137
Hyung. please think about it carefully.

216
00:12:34,705 --> 00:12:36,139
Hyung, you decide.

217
00:12:37,407 --> 00:12:40,243
Hyung, come over here. Please decide quickly.

218
00:12:42,412 --> 00:12:44,448
Poor thing, Gary.

219
00:12:45,348 --> 00:12:46,149
Hey!

220
00:12:46,149 --> 00:12:48,552
Oh, Ji Hyo!

221
00:12:49,786 --> 00:12:51,521
-Have you decided, hyung? -Ah?

222
00:12:52,055 --> 00:12:52,756
Who is it?

223
00:12:53,123 --> 00:12:54,257
Him.

224
00:12:54,458 --> 00:12:56,326
-Yeah! -Oh, really!

225
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:59,529
Gary will drink the poison!

226
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:05,469
We will provide the poison.

227
00:13:06,002 --> 00:13:08,038
What should I do after being eliminated?

228
00:13:08,038 --> 00:13:10,040
Looks like there's something. Where are you taking him?

229
00:13:11,274 --> 00:13:15,579
Let go of me! First, tell me who you are? Tell me who you are!

230
00:13:15,779 --> 00:13:17,013
Seriously, where are you taking him?

231
00:13:17,514 --> 00:13:20,050
-Where is he taking him to? -Where is he going, really?

232
00:13:22,586 --> 00:13:24,387
Look's like there's something.

233
00:13:27,023 --> 00:13:28,325
Oh! We re here!

234
00:13:28,325 --> 00:13:29,426
Where is this?

235
00:13:29,726 --> 00:13:31,428
A school? Isn't this a school?

236
00:13:31,528 --> 00:13:32,929
What are we doing here?

237
00:13:34,898 --> 00:13:36,433
What are we doing here?

238
00:13:37,901 --> 00:13:38,802
Ah!

239
00:13:38,802 --> 00:13:40,103
What's that?

240
00:13:40,103 --> 00:13:41,438
Look's like there's something there, hyung.

241
00:13:41,571 --> 00:13:43,140
-It's food. -Chocolate.

242
00:13:43,173 --> 00:13:44,107
-It's bread, bread. -Really?

243
00:13:46,476 --> 00:13:48,145
-Do we have to eat this? -What is this for?

244
00:13:48,211 --> 00:13:49,946
-That's for Cho. -And what's that for?

245
00:13:50,013 --> 00:13:53,984
The food is only prepared for the winning team.

246
00:13:54,151 --> 00:13:55,519
Only for us?

247
00:13:55,552 --> 00:13:57,287
Wah! I really like this!

248
00:13:57,354 --> 00:13:58,488
It mustitaste good!

249
00:13:58,488 --> 00:14:01,258
Ji Hyo. what are you gonna eat? Here, eat this.

250
00:14:02,859 --> 00:14:04,828
What's this?

251
00:14:04,928 --> 00:14:05,962
Here, eat the bread.

252
00:14:05,962 --> 00:14:07,831
Oppa, can we take these away?

253
00:14:07,931 --> 00:14:10,901
Why can't we have some?

254
00:14:11,034 --> 00:14:12,269
Seeause you tost.

255
00:14:12,302 --> 00:14:13,136
This is too much.

256
00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:16,173
-How can they have something to eat? -Just give us one.

257
00:14:16,239 --> 00:14:17,808
-Have one. -For real?

258
00:14:18,308 --> 00:14:19,376
Oh, thank you, hyung!

259
00:14:20,143 --> 00:14:22,012
It's for Soo Hyun.

260
00:14:23,513 --> 00:14:25,315
Our king is so cool.

261
00:14:25,415 --> 00:14:28,051
-Other than the King, there's only 2 of you? -Why?

262
00:14:28,051 --> 00:14:29,553
-That's a joke. -Why!

263
00:14:29,586 --> 00:14:31,354
They look so pitiful.

264
00:14:31,354 --> 00:14:34,457
After this game ends, there may be only two of us left.

265
00:14:35,659 --> 00:14:37,427
What are you saying?

266
00:14:37,627 --> 00:14:40,864
This second game is a reconnaissance.

267
00:14:45,602 --> 00:14:52,142
Each team member goes against a member of the same ranking. The team vvhose members wins the most will win the game.

268
00:14:52,142 --> 00:14:56,813
Yoo Jae Suk, you come out! You have the same rank as I am.

269
00:14:57,814 --> 00:14:59,115
What rank are you?

270
00:14:59,149 --> 00:15:01,818
-All of it! All! -Alright, I got it.

271
00:15:01,818 --> 00:15:03,820
Let's officially start the first round, shall we?

272
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:06,356
Don't you think you have many returning students?

273
00:15:06,356 --> 00:15:10,327
We also have someone who studies late and teacher, too.

274
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,863
I was born in the year 66! What of it!!

275
00:15:15,832 --> 00:15:20,303
You guys don't have students born in the 60's, right?

276
00:15:20,403 --> 00:15:21,171
None.

277
00:15:21,171 --> 00:15:24,107
The first round is a battle of wits.

278
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:26,877
Ahh! My dongsaeng!

279
00:15:27,043 --> 00:15:29,512
Me? Ahh... I'm the first one.

280
00:15:29,746 --> 00:15:33,450
-Today, we finally meet one another on the wooden bridge. -Jae Suk hyung waiting!

281
00:15:44,828 --> 00:15:45,962
Fighting!

282
00:15:45,962 --> 00:15:49,532
-I'm not worried about you, even for a bit. -I can beat him easily.

283
00:15:50,433 --> 00:15:53,803
The battle of wits is of course a battle of knowledge.

284
00:15:54,804 --> 00:15:56,706
Wait a second! Wait a second!

285
00:15:59,209 --> 00:16:00,543
What's this?

286
00:16:00,543 --> 00:16:02,145
I'm guessing they are letter scrolls,

287
00:16:02,512 --> 00:16:05,715
answer 3 out of 5 questions correctly to win.

288
00:16:05,849 --> 00:16:08,285
-Victory is in our hands. -We'll win for sure! 100%!

289
00:16:08,818 --> 00:16:14,524
No matter what question you choose, I'll sure answer it correctly. There's nothing that I don't know.

290
00:16:14,524 --> 00:16:16,059
This one!

291
00:16:16,726 --> 00:16:19,162
I really took it randomly.

292
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:22,232
Woorimal Quiz.

293
00:16:27,871 --> 00:16:29,406
Is there such a word?

294
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:30,807
-5 words? -5 words.

295
00:16:31,107 --> 00:16:33,376
-What kind of question is this? -It's too hard.

296
00:16:33,443 --> 00:16:35,879
It's too hard. How is this a Woorimal Quiz?

297
00:16:35,912 --> 00:16:37,247
Is the answer "The elders"?

298
00:16:37,347 --> 00:16:38,848
Entertainment room. Entertainment room.

299
00:16:39,382 --> 00:16:41,017
The elders in the entertainment rooms!

300
00:16:45,522 --> 00:16:47,123
The elder Arisu!

301
00:16:51,027 --> 00:16:53,530
We'll give you a hint, it's a propur noun.

302
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:55,498
It's a proper noun?

303
00:16:55,598 --> 00:17:00,103
-It can be a name of a place or a name of a person. -That's right.

304
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:01,905
Oppa! Our member's name !

305
00:17:02,405 --> 00:17:04,007
Oppa! Our member's name !

306
00:17:06,042 --> 00:17:07,410
Ok!

307
00:17:07,744 --> 00:17:10,180
Couldn't be...

308
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:14,884
Yooruce Willis!

309
00:17:14,951 --> 00:17:15,919
Right!

310
00:17:17,887 --> 00:17:20,056
- Yooruce Willis! - Right.

311
00:17:24,627 --> 00:17:28,631
That's right! Yooruce Willis! What were you thinking?

312
00:17:29,566 --> 00:17:32,836
Ji Hyo gave me the hint. I was right! I guessed it right!

313
00:17:32,869 --> 00:17:34,371
Why did you give him the hint?

314
00:17:34,371 --> 00:17:37,240
It's alright! it's alright!

315
00:17:38,008 --> 00:17:39,909
Our member's names.

316
00:17:43,113 --> 00:17:44,881
Hey, Ji Hyo. Thank you.

317
00:17:45,815 --> 00:17:47,317
Hey, when can we win?

318
00:17:48,451 --> 00:17:51,054
I already said it was the name of our members.

319
00:17:51,054 --> 00:17:52,288
Ahh... Seriously.

320
00:17:52,422 --> 00:17:54,557
Hey, I've only lost one round

321
00:17:55,458 --> 00:17:56,059
What?

322
00:17:56,126 --> 00:17:58,762
- General knowledge! - Oh yeah! I'm good at this.

323
00:17:59,929 --> 00:18:01,531
A category I'm good at.

324
00:18:06,302 --> 00:18:09,973
For 4 years, I studied... general knowledge.

325
00:18:10,073 --> 00:18:12,642
The general knowledge was passed down from generations! _

326
00:18:12,876 --> 00:18:15,612
General knowledge, the house rules of my home.

327
00:18:15,745 --> 00:18:18,848
General knowledge is the name of my son.

328
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:24,054
My Sang Shik hyung's lifestyle. General knowledge.

329
00:18:26,723 --> 00:18:30,260
He who lived well, Sang Shik hyung. General knowledge!

330
00:18:30,326 --> 00:18:31,327
I won!

331
00:18:33,129 --> 00:18:35,532
I love you, general knowledge.

332
00:18:36,066 --> 00:18:38,368
Please be my last love! General knowledge!

333
00:18:38,435 --> 00:18:39,903
It's general knowledge.

334
00:18:46,142 --> 00:18:49,612
If you wear underwear. you can achieve 3C of thermal warmth,

335
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:56,519
If the whole nation wears underwear. how many percentage of thermal energy can we save?

336
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,455
3%?

337
00:19:02,058 --> 00:19:03,660
15 percent.

338
00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:08,998
-20 percent! -That's right.

339
00:19:09,032 --> 00:19:10,533
-20 percent! -That's right.

340
00:19:14,504 --> 00:19:16,005
Oppa. waiting!

341
00:19:16,239 --> 00:19:18,908
No doubt! Quiz down, quiz down.

342
00:19:19,809 --> 00:19:23,379
The great house rules of our home, general knowledge!

343
00:19:23,746 --> 00:19:25,748
- Were you guessing? -He must he.

344
00:19:25,815 --> 00:19:27,484
I already knew the answer.

345
00:19:27,784 --> 00:19:30,587
- 20%. -Don't lie!

346
00:19:31,554 --> 00:19:33,256
Don't you watch PSA's?!

347
00:19:35,859 --> 00:19:38,361
1 to 1.

348
00:19:39,028 --> 00:19:40,163
I'll choose.

349
00:19:41,164 --> 00:19:42,532
Luck is on our side today.

350
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:46,035
I don't know which is which, it's driving me crazy!

351
00:19:46,402 --> 00:19:48,805
There's definitely a nonsense question in this one.

352
00:19:48,805 --> 00:19:49,939

527
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:50,840
You gave me a text. Do you think I would reply you?

528
00:29:50,873 --> 00:29:52,274
What did I send?

529
00:29:52,374 --> 00:29:55,878
-Love! -ME?

530
00:29:57,813 --> 00:30:00,282
Ji Hyo! Ji Hyo!

531
00:30:00,883 --> 00:30:03,853
It's right here, right here!

532
00:30:04,019 --> 00:30:06,322
I swear on my life, I didn't!

533
00:30:06,322 --> 00:30:08,324
-It's here -I swear on my life!

534
00:30:08,657 --> 00:30:09,959
Here, look, look!

535
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:12,928
It's right in here, look.

536
00:30:13,129 --> 00:30:14,997
I swear on my life! Seriously!

537
00:30:15,331 --> 00:30:15,731
Dong Hoon!

538
00:30:18,634 --> 00:30:21,537
Did you think I would consider you as a man if you sent that to me?

539
00:30:26,142 --> 00:30:32,014
I heard that in the past, HaHa oppa asked a mutual acquaintance to set us up?

540
00:30:32,515 --> 00:30:33,783
Really?

541
00:30:34,917 --> 00:30:36,051
Is that true?

542
00:30:39,688 --> 00:30:44,126
Why didn't you mention anything during the year and a half we've been doing Running Man?

543
00:30:46,128 --> 00:30:47,930
Seriously, this is so unfair!

544
00:30:48,097 --> 00:30:49,999
Isn't that why you talked to Jae Suk oppa about it?

545
00:30:50,065 --> 00:30:51,200
Me. telling Jae Suk?!

546
00:30:51,333 --> 00:30:52,301
I heard about it, too.

547
00:30:52,334 --> 00:30:53,402
You're saying I told you about it. hyung?

548
00:30:53,702 --> 00:30:56,572
I couldn't bear to say anything to Ji Hyo.

549
00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:02,378
-Is that why you sent that SMS at the end of the year? -Me?! Sending you that SMS? I just wanted to tell you to eat a lot!

550
00:31:02,511 --> 00:31:05,648
I'm sorry but I've never thought of you as a man.

551
00:31:05,881 --> 00:31:07,249
I don't care!

552
00:31:09,084 --> 00:31:10,119
Not at all, not at all.

553
00:31:10,252 --> 00:31:12,154
Good job. good job.

554
00:31:13,189 --> 00:31:13,923
Not at all.

555
00:31:14,223 --> 00:31:16,025
HaHa's highest heart rate is...

556
00:31:20,296 --> 00:31:21,130
149!

557
00:31:23,098 --> 00:31:24,266
Me. telling Jae Suk?!

558
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,569
-I heard about it, too. - You're saying I told you about it. hyung?

559
00:31:26,869 --> 00:31:27,937
Heart rate is 149.

560
00:31:30,039 --> 00:31:31,073
Good job. Ji Hyo!

561
00:31:33,209 --> 00:31:35,711
It's because I couldn't stand how unfair it was!

562
00:31:39,248 --> 00:31:40,883
This is seriously so absurd.

563
00:31:42,451 --> 00:31:45,354
If Soo Hyun doesn't raise Kwang Soo's heartbeat over 149, her team vvill lose.

564
00:31:45,454 --> 00:31:46,088
Of course.

565
00:31:49,458 --> 00:31:50,826
Just believe that she‘s playing you.

566
00:31:52,328 --> 00:31:59,235
Kwang Soo. Ji Hyo has set up everything for you, you just need to simply kick it down.

567
00:32:04,139 --> 00:32:05,541
Ok...start!

568
00:32:06,342 --> 00:32:07,643
Hello, Kwang Soo.

569
00:32:08,043 --> 00:32:09,511
-We're in big trouble. -We're already in trouble.

570
00:32:09,712 --> 00:32:10,813
-Don't meet her gaze. -Come closer.

571
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:11,914
You mustn't meet her eyes.

572
00:32:13,082 --> 00:32:15,384
Geez, it's already at 120.

573
00:32:15,484 --> 00:32:17,253
Seriously, what is wrong with that kid?

574
00:32:17,453 --> 00:32:19,421
You have to make eye contact when talking.

575
00:32:21,957 --> 00:32:25,861
Hang on. I'm seriously going to go crazy!

576
00:32:27,963 --> 00:32:29,298
Don't raise your voice.

577
00:32:29,398 --> 00:32:31,200
-Do you have a girlfriend? -No.

578
00:32:31,333 --> 00:32:32,968
Kwang Soo, Soo Hyun has no intention of dating you.

579
00:32:33,202 --> 00:32:36,872
-Just believe that she's playing you. -No, that's not true. Soo Hyun said that she liked Kwang Soo before.

580
00:32:36,872 --> 00:32:37,840
She's just toying with you.

581
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:39,375
Fix your posture.

582
00:32:40,542 --> 00:32:41,543
Call me 'Soo Hyun.

583
00:32:43,212 --> 00:32:44,313
While looking at me.

584
00:32:45,915 --> 00:32:46,482
Soo Hyun.

585
00:32:48,717 --> 00:32:49,518
Tell me.

586
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:52,254
What is this?

587
00:32:52,554 --> 00:32:53,522
Hurry up and do it.

588
00:32:53,656 --> 00:32:54,556
Hurry up.

589
00:32:55,958 --> 00:32:56,558
Soo Hyun.

590
00:32:56,659 --> 00:32:58,360
You know she's faking it, right?

591
00:33:08,737 --> 00:33:10,572
Oh, Kwang Soo, look how much he likes it.

592
00:33:13,609 --> 00:33:14,743
I'm so happy right now!

593
00:33:18,781 --> 00:33:20,282
You guys look really good together.

594
00:33:20,382 --> 00:33:21,517
You match very well.

595
00:33:22,952 --> 00:33:24,053
Hey, hey. Kwang Soo!

596
00:33:24,153 --> 00:33:26,021
Hyung, I want to go to the bathroom!

597
00:33:26,956 --> 00:33:27,856
Give me your phone number.

598
00:33:28,357 --> 00:33:29,358
Give me your phone number.

599
00:33:30,659 --> 00:33:31,927
She's serious.

600
00:33:32,161 --> 00:33:33,128
Enter it into my phone. ^

601
00:33:33,629 --> 00:33:35,597
It's not for real. It's seriously all pretend.

602
00:33:35,631 --> 00:33:36,865
What are you looking at?

603
00:33:38,267 --> 00:33:39,668
Give her your mother's number.

604
00:33:40,703 --> 00:33:43,772
- Look how happy Kwang Soo is. - Hey, Lee Kwang Soo! Get a hold of yourself!

605
00:33:43,973 --> 00:33:44,940
Yes, of course.

606
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:45,908
When?

607
00:33:47,109 --> 00:33:47,643
Tonight.

608
00:33:47,743 --> 00:33:51,080
Hey, Lee Kwang Soo! What are you saying, you'll call her tonight?

609
00:33:51,447 --> 00:33:53,549
He's acting like an adolescent boy!

610
00:33:54,516 --> 00:33:55,217
Ah, Kwang Soo.

611
00:33:56,552 --> 00:33:58,220
Ok, stop. We won, right?

612
00:33:59,421 --> 00:34:02,057
Lee Kwang Soo's highest heart rate is...

613
00:34:02,658 --> 00:34:04,159
One hundred forty....

614
00:34:08,797 --> 00:34:10,699
One hundred forty...

615
00:34:12,768 --> 00:34:13,602
Give me your phone number.

616
00:34:16,171 --> 00:34:17,172
She's serious.

617
00:34:18,007 --> 00:34:18,907
Yeah!

618
00:34:19,074 --> 00:34:21,043
Can't you give us 30 more seconds?

619
00:34:22,177 --> 00:34:23,612
I guess I'll have to delete the number.

620
00:34:24,146 --> 00:34:25,814
I guess I'll have to delete the number.

621
00:34:28,117 --> 00:34:29,451
What are you saying?

622
00:34:31,787 --> 00:34:33,889
She's not your average girl, Hong Soo Hyun. Definitely not.

623
00:34:34,056 --> 00:34:39,628
The score is 2:1. The last facs-off is worth 2 points!

624
00:34:39,728 --> 00:34:40,329
Of course!

625
00:34:40,929 --> 00:34:42,231
Oh, daebak!

626
00:34:43,065 --> 00:34:43,966
The Kings, please step forth.

627
00:34:43,999 --> 00:34:45,200
- You can do it. - Fighting!

628
00:34:45,401 --> 00:34:47,202
Fighting, fighting! Sunbaenim. fighting!

629
00:34:59,948 --> 00:35:02,818
Lee Beom Soo is a hyung I really like but...

630
00:35:03,318 --> 00:35:04,553
A win is a win.

631
00:35:05,954 --> 00:35:07,222
A win is a win.

632
00:35:24,573 --> 00:35:26,508
I'm about to go crazy. Ah, really.

633
00:35:27,242 --> 00:35:28,577
Why are you like this!

634
00:35:32,648 --> 00:35:33,282
What is it, what is it?

635
00:35:34,783 --> 00:35:35,617
It's slap-match.

636
00:35:35,717 --> 00:35:37,319
Ah, so it's this.

637
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,722
We've won, we've won!

638
00:35:41,123 --> 00:35:42,157
You can do it!

639
00:35:42,257 --> 00:35:43,058
Fighting!

640
00:35:43,659 --> 00:35:44,326
Here I go.

641
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:45,427
It‘s not going to turn over.

642
00:35:53,969 --> 00:35:55,504
He doesn't know how to play slap-match!

643
00:36:00,943 --> 00:36:01,543
Hyung!

644
00:36:02,911 --> 00:36:03,912
End it this time!

645
00:36:10,152 --> 00:36:12,121
Good! Hyung, make this your last try!

646
00:36:13,322 --> 00:36:15,023
Beom Soo hyung, hit it strongly!

647
00:36:31,306 --> 00:36:32,674
Ah, this is too thin.

648
00:36:34,243 --> 00:36:35,444
Ah. this is too thin.

649
00:36:38,614 --> 00:36:39,448
That's too thin?

650
00:36:40,048 --> 00:36:44,353
I thought you were going to say something impressive. "This is too thin,"

651
00:36:48,023 --> 00:36:48,657
Fighting, fighting.

652
00:36:58,800 --> 00:36:59,801
Why doesn't it flip over?

653
00:37:00,102 --> 00:37:01,570
- Yeah, maybe it is too thin. -I wonder why this doesn't work.

654
00:37:17,719 --> 00:37:18,287
We lost.

655
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:20,822
Jae Suk hyung is really good at slap-match.

656
00:37:22,925 --> 00:37:25,627
You're pretty good?

657
00:37:26,328 --> 00:37:28,363
Ah. you should have done it like that.

658
00:37:30,199 --> 00:37:33,402
- Why were you so bad at it? - If you hit right at the centre, it flips over immediately.

659
00:37:35,237 --> 00:37:35,804
See?

660
00:37:40,142 --> 00:37:42,811
The King has to now choose someone to eliminate.

661
00:37:42,978 --> 00:37:44,513
Fortunately it’s not us.

662
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:45,847
It really is a relief.

663
00:37:50,852 --> 00:37:51,887
Why are you acting like that?

664
00:37:53,922 --> 00:37:56,558
Hyung, to be honest it's uncomfortable to be around someone older than you.

665
00:38:00,529 --> 00:38:02,531
There's a lot to learn from older people.

666
00:38:07,603 --> 00:38:09,571
Even so. it's still uncomfortable.

667
00:38:10,772 --> 00:38:12,241
You know you're dead.

668
00:38:13,542 --> 00:38:15,644
We just can't seem to stop laughing.

669
00:38:16,311 --> 00:38:17,079
You know you're dead.

670
00:38:17,112 --> 00:38:19,181
Ah, so much fun, so much fun.

671
00:38:19,481 --> 00:38:21,817
Ah, seriously. So I can choose anyone?

672
00:38:21,950 --> 00:38:22,851
We should.have won.

673
00:38:23,752 --> 00:38:24,720
Kwang Soo.

674
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:25,988
Wow, really?

675
00:38:29,758 --> 00:38:30,759
It's uncomfortable.

676
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:34,329
Ah, so it's because Beom Soo thinks it‘ll get awkward if he drops him.

677
00:38:34,429 --> 00:38:36,164
Ah. so that's the reason.

678
00:38:36,498 --> 00:38:38,267
Kwang Soo, you've worked hard.

679
00:38:40,068 --> 00:38:42,571
I'm sorry, hut this is too dirty to handle anymore.

680
00:38:46,541 --> 00:38:47,909
-I can go by my own will! - Bye, Kwang Soo.

681
00:38:48,277 --> 00:38:49,244
I'll call you.

682
00:38:53,048 --> 00:38:54,549
He's probably going to cry.

683
00:39:01,456 --> 00:39:02,357
Hey, what is this?

684
00:39:05,527 --> 00:39:08,463
Are we supposed to stick something on here?

685
00:39:09,498 --> 00:39:11,900
What are these? We look like Robot Taekwon V.

686
00:39:12,734 --> 00:39:13,802
Yeah, you seriously do.

687
00:39:14,403 --> 00:39:17,272
Today's final mission location is Th is shopping mall.

688
00:39:18,006 --> 00:39:24,212
The first team to find all of the hidden pieces of the Royal Seal and compile them wins.

689
00:39:24,513 --> 00:39:25,380
How many?

690
00:39:25,614 --> 00:39:26,481
Nine.

691
00:39:26,882 --> 00:39:30,452
-That＊s a lot. -Stick the pieces that you find on your shoulders.

692
00:39:31,286 --> 00:39:33,588
- Can we steal them from the other team? - Each team needs to find nine?

693
00:39:33,655 --> 00:39:35,457
It becomes one seal if you collect all nine?

694
00:39:36,658 --> 00:39:38,160
Ok, set off!

695
00:39:39,027 --> 00:39:40,429
Hey, let's go the other way.

696
00:39:40,595 --> 00:39:41,663
Yes. that's right. Ji Hyo.

697
00:39:41,963 --> 00:39:43,298
Hey, let's go upstairs.

698
00:39:43,298 --> 00:39:44,533
Oppa, we have to go upstairs.

699
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:48,036
Is the escalator working? Oh, it's not on?

700
00:39:52,841 --> 00:39:55,243
Let's search through the second floor.

701
00:39:55,510 --> 00:39:56,111
Ok, let's do that.

702
00:39:59,314 --> 00:40:00,782
Doesn't seem like anything would be here.

703
00:40:01,350 --> 00:40:04,119
- Oppa, are you looking for it? -Yeah, aren't there any around?

704
00:40:04,119 --> 00:40:09,324
If you are just searching like that, of course you can't find it!

705
00:40:09,958 --> 00:40:11,426
Hey. look at the clothes.

706
00:40:11,426 --> 00:40:12,828
Oppa, can I look at this?

707
00:40:12,828 --> 00:40:14,830
Of course, look at the clothes.

708
00:40:19,167 --> 00:40:21,470
It's a calculator.

709
00:40:22,404 --> 00:40:24,072
Thought it was the seal.

710
00:40:24,606 --> 00:40:29,077
How can we find it when we don't even know what it looks like?

711
00:40:52,434 --> 00:40:53,402
Who is it?

712
00:40:53,402 --> 00:40:55,370
Him.

713
00:40:56,605 --> 00:40:58,140
Drink the poison!

714
00:41:03,211 --> 00:41:04,513
Kwang Soo...

715
00:41:04,513 --> 00:41:08,350
What? Really? It is so disgusting I can't carry on with this anymore.

716
00:41:09,751 --> 00:41:11,052
Kwang Soo.

717
00:41:19,828 --> 00:41:23,799
VVe are giving the both of you a chance to get revenge on your team mates.

718
00:41:23,799 --> 00:41:26,067
Do you want to accept this chance?

719
00:41:26,067 --> 00:41:27,602
Of course! Of course!

720
00:41:27,602 --> 00:41:30,071
Sure! Sure!

721
00:41:30,071 --> 00:41:31,473
You are too close!

722
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:33,542
You are too close!

723
00:41:33,542 --> 00:41:35,076
Ah, really,

724
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:37,913
It is too interesting,..

725
00:41:39,581 --> 00:41:40,982
We'll do well.

726
00:41:43,618 --> 00:41:44,553
We can definitely do this.

727
00:41:45,353 --> 00:41:46,588
Please give us the mission.

728
00:41:46,721 --> 00:41:49,357
I have been waiting for this moment for the past 6 hours.

729
00:41:49,424 --> 00:41:52,160
I came after sleeping, eating and resting,

730
00:41:53,128 --> 00:42:00,969
The members are currently searching for pieces of seal to he put together to win

731
00:42:00,969 --> 00:42:05,340
I will now give the each of you a piece of the seal.

732
00:42:14,583 --> 00:42:16,284
Then what am I?

733
00:42:17,252 --> 00:42:18,854
I thought of it first...

734
00:42:18,954 --> 00:42:21,022
Ah... I get it.

735
00:42:21,022 --> 00:42:22,958
Oh, and...

736
00:42:38,406 --> 00:42:40,408
We still have to carry out the secret mission.

737
00:42:40,408 --> 00:42:42,310
What is our final goal?

738
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:49,851
Help any one of the teams to win and you can propose to share their reward.

739
00:42:49,851 --> 00:42:52,821
Or get an apology for abandoning yon.

740
00:42:52,821 --> 00:42:54,556
This is definitely necessary.

741
00:42:55,156 --> 00:43:00,328
If you don't want any team to win...

742
00:43:00,328 --> 00:43:03,665
You can dealy them till the time limit is over and win shopping vouchers for yourself,

743
00:43:03,665 --> 00:43:09,104
If the both of you perform well, you will receive shopping vouchers as your reward.

744
00:43:09,771 --> 00:43:12,374
We have to last till the end?

745
00:43:12,374 --> 00:43:13,408
Yes.

746
00:43:14,142 --> 00:43:17,312
We are the Ji team of Cho Han Ji.

747
00:43:17,312 --> 00:43:19,681
Hmm? The Ji nation?

748
00:43:20,549 --> 00:43:21,883
I get it.

749
00:43:21,883 --> 00:43:23,151
Ji...

750
00:43:23,151 --> 00:43:24,019
Suk...

751
00:43:24,019 --> 00:43:25,453
Eh

752
00:43:26,922 --> 00:43:28,857
We are going to complete the mission.

753
00:43:53,648 --> 00:43:57,652
Oh, what is that?

754
00:43:58,286 --> 00:44:00,822
That kid with good eyesight! She's going up again!

755
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:06,628
Hurry and go back down.

756
00:44:06,628 --> 00:44:08,730
I came to take a look.

757
00:44:08,863 --> 00:44:10,999
- Go down. -What's wrong? What's wrong?

758
00:44:11,933 --> 00:44:15,003
What? I came here first.

759
00:44:17,639 --> 00:44:18,907
Oh!!

760
00:44:20,342 --> 00:44:23,411
You are even acting now!

761
00:44:26,481 --> 00:44:30,352
Hey, where will the pieces of the seal be hidden?

762
00:44:32,153 --> 00:44:34,522
Oh, a royal seal?

763
00:44:50,271 --> 00:44:51,673
Oh, Oppa you found it right!

764
00:44:51,673 --> 00:44:52,273
Huh?

765
00:44:52,273 --> 00:44:53,141
You found it right?

766
00:44:53,141 --> 00:44:54,209
No, I didn't.

767
00:44:55,243 --> 00:44:56,111
You found it.

768
00:44:56,111 --> 00:44:57,512
No, I didn't.

769
00:44:59,881 --> 00:45:01,950
Where was it?

770
00:45:01,950 --> 00:45:03,718
Hey! Ji Hyo!

771
00:45:03,718 --> 00:45:05,553
No! No!

772
00:45:05,553 --> 00:45:07,255
- What are you doing? -What is this?

773
00:45:09,257 --> 00:45:10,558
No!

774
00:45:15,664 --> 00:45:16,898
Hey, where did you go?

775
00:45:16,898 --> 00:45:17,499
What?

776
00:45:18,099 --> 00:45:19,300
Oh, did you find it?

777
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:20,368
No.

778
00:45:20,368 --> 00:45:26,541
Ah! Ah! Look at him!

779
00:45:27,742 --> 00:45:29,477
- Hyung, there's nothing. -Let me see.

780
00:45:29,511 --> 00:45:31,680
-I don't have anything. -Let me see.

781
00:45:36,051 --> 00:45:37,352
Let me see.

782
00:45:38,286 --> 00:45:41,556
Search for it carefully, you should be able to find it.

783
00:45:42,724 --> 00:45:44,726
Oppa, please let me take a look.

784
00:45:55,937 --> 00:45:57,572
Hyung, they found one.

785
00:45:58,406 --> 00:46:00,008
He sticks it on his left chest.

786
00:46:00,308 --> 00:46:02,343
Hide it properly!

787
00:46:04,245 --> 00:46:06,347
It was well hidden but I saw it because of Soo Hyun.

788
00:46:07,482 --> 00:46:11,453
Tell me, it was found out because of Soo Hyun ssi.

789
00:46:13,021 --> 00:46:14,122
Hyung.

790
00:46:30,271 --> 00:46:34,709
The garden is like this, and it was placed at this area.

791
00:46:38,913 --> 00:46:41,649
What, a soap?

792
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:47,722
I got a shock.

793
00:47:11,713 --> 00:47:14,282
Oh, it's here.

794
00:47:27,529 --> 00:47:29,063
Wow, this...

795
00:47:53,087 --> 00:47:57,358
Should we hide? No one knows we are here.

796
00:47:57,559 --> 00:47:59,194
Someone's coming.

797
00:47:59,194 --> 00:48:02,964
If someone comes over, pretend we are shopping.

798
00:48:10,171 --> 00:48:15,677
Hey! Who is that? Kwang Soo! Gary!

799
00:48:16,611 --> 00:48:18,880
There must he something going on since they are running away.

800
00:48:22,851 --> 00:48:24,853
Come here! Come here!

801
00:48:26,888 --> 00:48:28,156
What's happening?

802
00:48:30,959 --> 00:48:32,727
Oh! It's Gary's voice!

803
00:48:35,630 --> 00:48:37,699
Where is Kwang Soo?

804
00:48:38,099 --> 00:48:39,067
You guys!

805
00:48:43,471 --> 00:48:45,206
Hey Kwang Soo!

806
00:48:45,206 --> 00:48:47,242
- What's happening? - What are you doing!

807
00:48:47,609 --> 00:48:48,776
What's with them?

808
00:48:51,346 --> 00:48:53,481
Hey! Where were the both of you?

809
00:48:54,182 --> 00:48:56,150
Oppa! Gary oppa's shoes.

810
00:48:56,150 --> 00:48:57,051
What's inside?

811
00:48:57,051 --> 00:48:58,386
There's nothing.

812
00:48:58,386 --> 00:49:00,288
In the shoe?

813
00:49:00,288 --> 00:49:01,856
No, there's nothing.

814
00:49:01,856 --> 00:49:03,258
We were here less than a minute ago.

815
00:49:03,258 --> 00:49:05,493
- What are you trying to do? - That hyung...

816
00:49:05,927 --> 00:49:08,296
What did we do wrong to have this happening at the beginning!

817
00:49:08,630 --> 00:49:11,299
He tried to catch us the moment he saw us!

818
00:49:11,299 --> 00:49:13,201
Take out your foot, quickly!

819
00:49:13,201 --> 00:49:13,902
What?

820
00:49:13,902 --> 00:49:15,069
Take out your foot!

821
00:49:15,069 --> 00:49:18,172
What are they doing? What's wrong?

822
00:49:18,172 --> 00:49:18,806
Give me a moment!

823
00:49:18,806 --> 00:49:20,308
Stop moving!

824
00:49:37,825 --> 00:49:39,627
Oppa, there's something in Kwang Soo's pocket.

825
00:49:39,627 --> 00:49:40,862
No, it's just a pocket.

826
00:49:43,164 --> 00:49:45,934
Noona, how did you do this? It is stuck there on purpose?

827
00:49:45,934 --> 00:49:48,703
My name tag is on your hair!

828
00:49:49,237 --> 00:49:52,807
Ji Hyo, what are you doing?

829
00:49:52,807 --> 00:49:55,476
How did it end up on your hair?

830
00:49:55,743 --> 00:49:57,812
- Ah... It hurts... - What is this?

831
00:49:58,112 --> 00:49:59,881
- Hey, Ji Hyo. - Look at this.

832
00:50:00,281 --> 00:50:01,883
- This is possible? - What is this?

833
00:50:01,883 --> 00:50:03,451
Ow, it hurts.

834
00:50:03,751 --> 00:50:06,187
- Hey, what are you doing? - Take off your shoes and socks.

835
00:50:06,187 --> 00:50:08,756
- We just got. here. - Quickly, just take off your shoes and socks.

836
00:50:08,756 --> 00:50:10,758
- Why would 1 take off my socks? - Take them off.

837
00:50:10,758 --> 00:50:12,827
Where did you come from? Where were you?

838
00:50:12,827 --> 00:50:13,895
We just got...

839
00:50:14,762 --> 00:50:16,297
Do you really want to see me go crazy?

840
00:50:16,297 --> 00:50:17,498
- Hey. -Hyung.

841
00:50:17,498 --> 00:50:19,200
- Take off your socks. - Hyung. I...

842
00:50:19,267 --> 00:50:20,902
Take off your socks.

843
00:50:21,169 --> 00:50:22,170
Hey!

844
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:27,642
He really bit me!

845
00:50:27,642 --> 00:50:29,510
Hey, you really...!

846
00:50:31,212 --> 00:50:33,348
- Noona, I'm sorry! Sorry1! - Ji Hyo...

847
00:50:33,348 --> 00:50:36,451
Oppa! Look, he really hit me!

848
00:50:38,086 --> 00:50:41,589
- Hey! How could you really bite me! Where are you going? - Hey!

849
00:50:41,589 --> 00:50:42,757
You..!

850
00:50:46,794 --> 00:50:49,797
He really hit me!

851
00:50:49,998 --> 00:50:51,432
See this?!

852
00:50:54,469 --> 00:50:56,437
Not only does he put me in a armbar...

853
00:50:59,741 --> 00:51:00,908
Come in.

854
00:51:06,748 --> 00:51:08,583
Please help me check if my scalp is bleeding.

855
00:51:12,787 --> 00:51:14,455
Please stick on my name tag.

856
00:51:14,455 --> 00:51:16,858
It's a habit, ripping off my name tag.

857
00:51:27,802 --> 00:51:29,103
- Kang Gary! -Yes?

858
00:51:29,103 --> 00:51:30,671
- Where were you? -What?

859
00:51:30,671 --> 00:51:32,373
- Do we have to find this? - Hmm?

860
00:51:32,373 --> 00:51:33,207
Do we have to find this?

861
00:51:33,207 --> 00:51:35,610
- What are you doing? - I'll find it for you and give you the victory!

862
00:51:35,610 --> 00:51:36,511
- Really? -Yes!

863
00:51:36,511 --> 00:51:37,412
Why?

864
00:51:37,512 --> 00:51:41,449
What do you mean, why? That team betrayed me, so I'll help you out, hyung.

865
00:51:41,449 --> 00:51:43,918
- Do I have to find this, hyung? - Yeah.

866
00:51:44,452 --> 00:51:47,188
- I guess I gotta start looking. - But what are you doing?

867
00:51:47,388 --> 00:51:52,060
I've come here to help you, hyung. As a phoenix lollol!

868
00:51:55,063 --> 00:51:55,663
Hey!

869
00:51:55,663 --> 00:52:00,501
- Hyung! If you say, "lollol" I'll come. -I think you're acting, hut I'm not sure what you're acting.

870
00:52:00,501 --> 00:52:02,336
What acting?! I’m, hyung.,!

871
00:52:02,470 --> 00:52:05,239
He's acting, but what...?

872
00:52:05,239 --> 00:52:06,741
Find the lollol! Lollol!!

873
00:52:08,409 --> 00:52:11,179
What is he up to?

874
00:52:11,179 --> 00:52:12,880
Hyung, no one's upstairs?

875
00:52:13,781 --> 00:52:15,349
Yeah...

876
00:52:15,883 --> 00:52:17,952
Just what is he up to?

877
00:52:19,053 --> 00:52:22,457
Lollol!

878
00:52:24,592 --> 00:52:26,427
It's dangerous,

879
00:52:26,527 --> 00:52:30,198
-So instead of where people can go on two feet, let's go to the higher floors. -Yes.

880
00:52:31,332 --> 00:52:32,533
Why... why is he...

881
00:52:32,533 --> 00:52:34,202
Why are you running away?

882
00:52:36,137 --> 00:52:38,072
- Why are you running away? - Noona.

883
00:52:38,072 --> 00:52:38,806
Yes?

884
00:52:38,806 --> 00:52:39,740
I＊ll call!

885
00:52:40,241 --> 00:52:41,909
I received your text.

886
00:52:44,912 --> 00:52:47,782
Before, when we exchanged numbers...

887
00:52:47,782 --> 00:52:50,852
I saw he had sent a text.

888
00:52:51,786 --> 00:52:53,688
I saw you sent a text with a heart?

889
00:52:54,689 --> 00:52:56,257
I saw you sent a text with a heart?!

890
00:52:57,859 --> 00:53:00,128
What are you doing? What are you doing?

891
00:53:00,128 --> 00:53:01,963
I don't know. I just came here.

892
00:53:04,298 --> 00:53:05,333
I just came.

893
00:53:05,333 --> 00:53:07,802
Soo Hyun. Come quickly and let's talk with him.

894
00:53:08,369 --> 00:53:10,771
- No, no. Please don't concern yourself with me. - Yeah.

895
00:53:10,771 --> 00:53:13,341
- Please lift up your shoes! Your sole. - Yeah,yeah.

896
00:53:13,341 --> 00:53:15,443
- Let me see. - What will you do for me if 1 do?

897
00:53:15,710 --> 00:53:17,945
-You shoes, quickly. - A phone call! Tell him you'll call him

898
00:53:18,546 --> 00:53:20,548
Tell him you'll call him. You can call him now. can't you?

899
00:53:21,949 --> 00:53:24,152
I want to pick it up here by myself.

900
00:53:31,492 --> 00:53:32,660
Oh, noona!

901
00:53:33,327 --> 00:53:34,595
Where are you?

902
00:53:34,595 --> 00:53:36,097
I think I‘ll be a bit late.

903
00:53:36,097 --> 00:53:37,398
Where are you?

904
00:53:37,665 --> 00:53:40,468
I... I'm Tate, aren't I?

905
00:53:40,868 --> 00:53:42,603
I'm tired of waiting here.

906
00:53:42,870 --> 00:53:44,372
Wait a little hit longer.

907
00:53:44,372 --> 00:53:46,908
I‘ll wash up and go.

908
00:53:47,041 --> 00:53:49,143
Your unmade face is more manly.

909
00:53:49,710 --> 00:53:52,113
The way you are is good.

910
00:53:52,446 --> 00:53:53,681
Noona...

911
00:53:54,081 --> 00:53:55,283
I'm sorry.

912
00:53:55,816 --> 00:53:58,653
Don't change your socks.

913
00:53:59,253 --> 00:54:00,688
I won't.

914
00:54:01,088 --> 00:54:03,357
Just come. I want to see you.

915
00:54:03,357 --> 00:54:05,193
It's OK even if it's just a minute. Please.

916
00:54:05,660 --> 00:54:07,328
Please, really.

917
00:54:07,728 --> 00:54:11,632
Let me smell your feet for just one minute!

918
00:54:15,436 --> 00:54:17,672
Where are you? I think he ran away.

919
00:54:17,672 --> 00:54:20,508
-He what... Where did he go? -He went upstairs.

920
00:54:21,209 --> 00:54:22,410
Ah... Seriously...

921
00:54:24,111 --> 00:54:26,280
-He must have something on his feet. -He does, he does.

922
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:27,682
He has something.

923
00:54:27,682 --> 00:54:29,217
Something on his sole.

924
00:54:31,886 --> 00:54:33,087
Yes, noona...

925
00:54:33,187 --> 00:54:34,388
Where are you?

926
00:54:34,889 --> 00:54:37,158
I'm., in front of my house.

927
00:54:37,158 --> 00:54:38,859
Let's talk for a bit.

928
00:54:39,227 --> 00:54:40,094
Something wrong?

929
00:54:40,094 --> 00:54:42,997
No, I have something to say.

930
00:54:42,997 --> 00:54:45,900
Then I'll be waiting at the place we met.

931
00:54:50,238 --> 00:54:51,239
I'm here.

932
00:54:51,239 --> 00:54:53,040
You really are a bad man.

933
00:54:53,307 --> 00:54:54,108
It's so hot.

934
00:54:54,108 --> 00:54:55,910
-Did you find something? -No...

935
00:54:55,910 --> 00:54:57,178
Well, I found one.

936
00:54:57,178 --> 00:54:58,279
You found one?

937
00:54:58,512 --> 00:54:59,847
Oh? Yeah...

938
00:54:59,847 --> 00:55:01,482
It's OK. I'm already...

939
00:55:01,482 --> 00:55:03,751
I'm not your enemy. I won't hurt you.

940
00:55:04,352 --> 00:55:13,327
Well continue to meet as we continue to act and since we've exchanged our contact info, we'll get along, right?

941
00:55:14,128 --> 00:55:17,765
If we want to improve our relationship, you need to tell me, right?

942
00:55:20,501 --> 00:55:22,770
For you only, noona... I'll show you.

943
00:55:22,970 --> 00:55:24,171
Ye..aah!

944
00:55:24,472 --> 00:55:27,341
-Will you keep my secret? -Okay.

945
00:55:47,295 --> 00:55:48,362
Please give it to me.

946
00:55:48,362 --> 00:55:51,432
-What, no., this isn't... -What is it?

947
00:55:51,899 --> 00:55:54,902
I have to hold onto this. This is my only weapon.

948
00:55:54,902 --> 00:55:59,640
Gimmmmmme...

949
00:56:01,142 --> 00:56:02,677
Quickly, give me!

950
00:56:06,180 --> 00:56:07,915
This feels weird!

951
00:56:08,082 --> 00:56:09,116
Wait!

952
00:56:09,116 --> 00:56:11,252
It feels like we're the only two here in this space!

953
00:56:14,288 --> 00:56:16,857
-But if I give this to you. I'm done. - Why? Why are you done?

954
00:56:16,857 --> 00:56:20,428
-I only have this one thing. But I don't need this at the end. -Why? Yeah?

955
00:56:20,428 --> 00:56:21,329
I'll give it to you later.

956
00:56:21,329 --> 00:56:23,898
-Later when? -Later, I'll definitely give it to you, noona.

957
00:56:23,964 --> 00:56:25,032
Promise.

958
00:56:26,801 --> 00:56:28,669
-Can you do that just once more? - What?

959
00:56:28,669 --> 00:56:29,470
That...

960
00:56:30,271 --> 00:56:32,106
No! Quickly!

961
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:37,578
Aaaaang- Quiiiickly!!

962
00:56:41,649 --> 00:56:43,150
Quickly!

963
00:56:43,718 --> 00:56:46,687
-Before it's over, I'll give it to you. -OK, now promise!

964
00:56:57,398 --> 00:56:59,100
We're like this right now...

965
00:56:59,567 --> 00:57:01,068
Before you get married...

966
00:57:01,836 --> 00:57:04,605
-When you go to purchase... -You think?

967
00:57:04,638 --> 00:57:05,906
Do you like massage chairs?

968
00:57:05,906 --> 00:57:07,641
Massage chairs... are good.

969
00:57:11,912 --> 00:57:13,280
Do we need a massage chair?

970
00:57:13,848 --> 00:57:16,150
I'll be your massage chair for the rest of your life.

971
00:57:22,089 --> 00:57:24,892
Do you want a son? Or a daughter?

972
00:57:31,866 --> 00:57:34,168
While we were searching for this.

973
00:57:34,168 --> 00:57:36,003
Do you think Gary and Kwang Soo are doing something?

974
00:57:36,003 --> 00:57:39,173
That level of deduction, hyung, do it mysteriously.

975
00:57:40,107 --> 00:57:43,310
That level of deduction, hyung, do it well.

976
00:57:44,412 --> 00:57:46,280
Ah, this, really...

977
00:57:56,056 --> 00:57:57,558
These items...

978
00:58:11,372 --> 00:58:12,840
These women's clothing...

979
00:58:19,780 --> 00:58:24,985
-It＊s so hard to find it! Because it's hidden in weird places... -They made it too hard. While we search for these.

980
00:58:29,290 --> 00:58:30,257
What?

981
00:58:31,258 --> 00:58:32,660
-Where was it? -Hey, it was right here.

982
00:58:32,660 --> 00:58:33,627
Where was it?

983
00:58:33,627 --> 00:58:35,095
-Did you search here? -Yeah.

984
00:58:35,095 --> 00:58:36,197
I passed by here lots of times.

985
00:58:36,197 --> 00:58:36,964
Are you sure you're not a fool?

986
00:58:36,997 --> 00:58:38,866
-Why? -It was right here.

987
00:58:38,866 --> 00:58:40,367
It was here?

988
00:58:43,771 --> 00:58:45,539
Hey, Kwang Soo.

989
00:58:46,807 --> 00:58:48,075
You hid it well?

990
00:58:48,542 --> 00:58:50,911
-I nearly got mine stolen. -Me too, me too.

991
00:58:50,911 --> 00:58:52,546
What are you going to do?

992
00:58:52,613 --> 00:58:55,749
I have a girl I like.

993
00:58:56,917 --> 00:58:57,952
Soo Hyun?

994
00:58:59,587 --> 00:59:02,490
How could you trust someone at your first meeting?!

995
00:59:02,656 --> 00:59:06,327
-The truth in her eyes... -It's the 80th episode for me and Ji Hyo!

996
00:59:07,194 --> 00:59:08,629
It's the SOth episode.

997
00:59:08,629 --> 00:59:10,698
Don’t be shaken by a girl now, understand?

998
00:59:10,798 --> 00:59:12,600
What do you want to do?

999
00:59:12,967 --> 00:59:14,401
Do you want us to win?

1000
00:59:14,401 --> 00:59:17,571
We definitely have to go together. Hyung, we're definitely...

1001
00:59:17,571 --> 00:59:19,273
But, before, honestly...

1002
00:59:19,540 --> 00:59:20,608
Gary hyung!

1003
00:59:21,041 --> 00:59:21,976
Yeah?

1004
00:59:22,076 --> 00:59:24,578
- Hyung, why aren't you picking up your calls? - Dong Hoon.

1005
00:59:24,578 --> 00:59:26,647
I sent a text, Kwang Soo.

1006
00:59:27,081 --> 00:59:29,183
I sent a text, Kwang Soo.

1007
00:59:29,950 --> 00:59:30,918
Gary hyung!

1008
00:59:31,485 --> 00:59:32,786
I'll leave first!

1009
00:59:38,759 --> 00:59:40,027
Hey, Kwang Soo!

1010
00:59:40,528 --> 00:59:41,562
Kwang Soo!

1011
00:59:43,063 --> 00:59:44,632
-Hey! - Yes, hyung?

1012
00:59:44,632 --> 00:59:45,733
Get a hold of yourself!!

1013
00:59:45,733 --> 00:59:48,235
Just a bit... I got an important text.

1014
00:59:48,235 --> 00:59:49,103
Hey!

1015
00:59:50,337 --> 00:59:52,172
I can't win.

1016
00:59:54,575 --> 00:59:57,111
I don't have anything. I can't even win.

1017
00:59:58,078 --> 00:59:59,647
If I had something.

1018
01:00:01,782 --> 01:00:02,917
I'd give it to you.

1019
01:00:03,918 --> 01:00:05,286
Why? Why is it like this?

1020
01:00:05,352 --> 01:00:07,087
- It's because my leg is in pain. - I got it.

1021
01:00:07,288 --> 01:00:08,556
You have to believe me, Dong Hoon.

1022
01:00:08,656 --> 01:00:10,457
Ah, why won't you let me see?

1023
01:00:10,558 --> 01:00:11,992
There is! Inside.

1024
01:00:11,992 --> 01:00:13,627
There's nothing.

1025
01:00:13,694 --> 01:00:15,029
Go back.

1026
01:00:15,095 --> 01:00:16,196
Did you see Kwang Soo?

1027
01:00:18,098 --> 01:00:19,567
Did you see Kwang Soo?

1028
01:00:22,403 --> 01:00:24,171
Hey, l really like you.

1029
01:00:25,005 --> 01:00:26,941
There's obviously something inside.

1030
01:00:27,041 --> 01:00:29,710
He shoved it back in to conceal it.

1031
01:00:30,377 --> 01:00:31,879
I'm asking you what this is.

1032
01:00:32,012 --> 01:00:35,249
It's swollen. I hurt it it, during the games earlier.

1033
01:00:35,416 --> 01:00:36,350
It's right here.

1034
01:00:36,550 --> 01:00:38,586
This is ours...that's, nothing at all.

1035
01:00:39,887 --> 01:00:41,989
It's my money, my emergency funds!

1036
01:00:42,389 --> 01:00:43,857
- It's my emergency funds. -Hyung.

1037
01:00:44,558 --> 01:00:48,362
Before anyone finds out, hide it under your sole.

1038
01:00:49,029 --> 01:00:49,797
I got it.

1039
01:00:49,897 --> 01:00:51,065
You got it?

1040
01:00:51,265 --> 01:00:52,833
Aren't you admitting it by saying that?

1041
01:00:52,833 --> 01:00:54,301
Hey Dong Hoon, keep it a secret.

1042
01:00:54,301 --> 01:00:55,803
Ah, of course.

1043
01:00:55,903 --> 01:00:57,071
Hey, let's hurry.

1044
01:00:57,071 --> 01:00:58,772
- There's no one. - This won't do.

1045
01:00:59,006 --> 01:01:00,941
- Because of.this... -Huh?

1046
01:01:01,709 --> 01:01:03,377
I'm so stressed trying to hide it.

1047
01:01:03,677 --> 01:01:05,045
Ah, what sort of concealment is this?

1048
01:01:05,679 --> 01:01:07,348
Ah, please hide it properly. Iiyung,

1049
01:01:07,681 --> 01:01:09,750
I thought nobody would be able to find this, who would know?

1050
01:01:09,817 --> 01:01:12,086
Who would have known, it's too funny.

1051
01:01:12,186 --> 01:01:14,188
Hey, I already let you see it.

1052
01:01:16,256 --> 01:01:18,258
Don't laugh, this is so important.

1053
01:01:18,359 --> 01:01:19,093
That's why.

1054
01:01:19,093 --> 01:01:20,394
But tell me honestly.

1055
01:01:21,562 --> 01:01:25,265
Earlier, my country betrayed me.

1056
01:01:25,599 --> 01:01:29,136
So I'm going over to that team to offer my help.

1057
01:01:29,303 --> 01:01:30,971
- Help me to get over.7- Ok, ok.

1058
01:01:31,038 --> 01:01:32,439
-Hyung. - This is really a secret.

1059
01:01:32,506 --> 01:01:33,540
Ah, of course.

1060
01:01:33,607 --> 01:01:34,708
You... agree, right?

1061
01:01:34,742 --> 01:01:37,511
- Ah hyung. I'm unconditionally... - For me, I won't even be able to benefit anyway.

1062
01:01:37,578 --> 01:01:38,412
Ah. exactly.

1063
01:01:38,512 --> 01:01:42,616
I'll just, let you win, honestly, so we can split the prize.

1064
01:01:42,616 --> 01:01:44,018
Ah, definitely. I'll give you all of it.

1065
01:01:44,051 --> 01:01:44,952
Ah, not all of it.

1066
01:01:44,985 --> 01:01:46,387
I ll give you everything.

1067
01:01:46,587 --> 01:01:48,689
Look, there are nine pieces in total, ok?

1068
01:01:48,989 --> 01:01:52,660
If there are nine pieces, this is just one of them.

1069
01:01:52,726 --> 01:01:53,494
Exactly.

1070
01:01:53,594 --> 01:01:56,263
Without mine, they just can't win.

1071
01:01:56,397 --> 01:01:57,264
Of, of course.

1072
01:01:57,297 --> 01:01:58,766
- Do you know what I mean? -I know,I know.

1073
01:01:58,932 --> 01:02:01,635
Although I have no way of winning, they still need me.

1074
01:02:01,669 --> 01:02:02,670
Ah, of course.

1075
01:02:02,770 --> 01:02:04,605
- So you have to treat me better. - Ah, definitely.

1076
01:02:06,740 --> 01:02:07,908
Jeez.

1077
01:02:08,976 --> 01:02:09,710
Don't forget.

1078
01:02:09,777 --> 01:02:10,711
I got it, ok.

1079
01:02:11,111 --> 01:02:12,613
- Fighting! - Fighting, fighting.

1080
01:02:21,989 --> 01:02:24,358
There is still 30 minutes before the mission ends...

1081
01:02:24,591 --> 01:02:30,297
Gary and Kwang Soo, they seem to have something to do before the given time.

1082
01:02:32,733 --> 01:02:35,402
It seems like whoever outlasts the other will just win.

1083
01:02:35,536 --> 01:02:37,237
Then would there be something else?

1084
01:02:37,237 --> 01:02:39,073
Do they have to carry out obstructions?

1085
01:02:40,040 --> 01:02:44,645
- If the country isn't unified then they'll win. - Not unified. If we're not unified.

1086
01:02:44,845 --> 01:02:47,381
They'll just win. they'll get the reward.

1087
01:02:50,417 --> 01:02:51,985
It seems like this is it.

1088
01:02:55,089 --> 01:02:56,657
-I really don't have it. - You must have it.

1089
01:02:56,757 --> 01:02:58,192
Hyung. I don’t have It. I was wrong.

1090
01:02:58,258 --> 01:02:59,493
Let's discuss it.

1091
01:02:59,727 --> 01:03:01,628
- Huh. Idon't have anything. - No, just once...

1092
01:03:01,962 --> 01:03:03,797
Don't do this. Get rid of the suspicions around you.

1093
01:03:04,098 --> 01:03:06,066
- Get rid of what, hyung? - The suspicions.

1094
01:03:07,901 --> 01:03:09,336
Ah, this is so weird, hyung.

1095
01:03:11,805 --> 01:03:12,473
Go in, go in.

1096
01:03:12,506 --> 01:03:14,041
- Ah, I really don't have it. - Go in.

1097
01:03:14,441 --> 01:03:17,678
- Jeez! I really don't have it. - Hang on, Take it off quickly.

1098
01:03:18,579 --> 01:03:20,147
-I don't have it, I don't have it. - Give it quick.

1099
01:03:20,781 --> 01:03:25,552
Oppa, now take off Kwang Soo's...what's nearest, nearest to oppa.

1100
01:03:25,686 --> 01:03:29,289
Some, some hidden areas, near the mic, the mic.

1101
01:03:29,456 --> 01:03:30,057
There's nothing.

1102
01:03:30,157 --> 01:03:31,358
The mic area, check the mic.

1103
01:03:32,159 --> 01:03:34,394
This humiliation, I‘ll definitely avenge it!

1104
01:03:35,562 --> 01:03:37,097
Gary hyung!

1105
01:03:40,067 --> 01:03:41,401
Why isn't there anything?

1106
01:03:43,437 --> 01:03:45,939
Kwang Soo. weren't you really holding on to it?

1107
01:03:46,206 --> 01:03:48,041
Take it out for hyung to win this once.

1108
01:03:54,715 --> 01:03:55,549
In here?

1109
01:03:55,616 --> 01:03:56,350
Oppa, it’s here.

1110
01:03:56,517 --> 01:03:58,318
-The water's all finished. -No!

1111
01:03:58,986 --> 01:03:59,686
No!

1112
01:03:59,787 --> 01:04:01,188
The water's been drunk!

1113
01:04:01,255 --> 01:04:02,556
Hey, so it's here.

1114
01:04:04,158 --> 01:04:05,526
Ah, it's here.

1115
01:04:07,895 --> 01:04:09,797
-It's here. -Found it, found it.

1116
01:04:09,997 --> 01:04:10,964
Hey, seriously.

1117
01:04:18,972 --> 01:04:21,575
-There is something,pppa. for real. -It's been snatched away.

1118
01:04:39,259 --> 01:04:41,028
I promised Soo Hyun noona.

1119
01:04:42,429 --> 01:04:43,697
Sorry, Kwang Soo.

1120
01:04:47,100 --> 01:04:48,769
You really look like a ghost.

1121
01:04:55,075 --> 01:04:56,376
I don't need anything else!

1122
01:05:05,252 --> 01:05:07,788
-Seems like hey got another one again. -Jeez, it couldn't be.

1123
01:05:09,156 --> 01:05:11,158
Hey.

1124
01:05:11,892 --> 01:05:13,026
Hey, what are you doing?

1125
01:05:13,026 --> 01:05:13,527
Get it.

1126
01:05:13,527 --> 01:05:14,928
-Ah, my shoe... -Hey. get it quickly.

1127
01:05:14,962 --> 01:05:15,929
Where is it?

1128
01:05:16,797 --> 01:05:18,232
We're very curious about your feet now.

1129
01:05:19,333 --> 01:05:20,701
I didn't do anything.

1130
01:05:21,168 --> 01:05:23,237
-There's something here, there's something here. -Get it quickly!

1131
01:05:24,238 --> 01:05:26,139
-Hyung, I said I'd really help you! -I got it, I got it.

1132
01:05:27,241 --> 01:05:28,242
There's still one more, where is it?

1133
01:05:28,442 --> 01:05:29,676
-Oppa. -There's still one more.

1134
01:05:29,710 --> 01:05:31,311
One more is still with Gary oppa.

1135
01:05:31,345 --> 01:05:32,512
Right, that's right.

1136
01:05:32,579 --> 01:05:34,348
-Hyung, I said I'd really help you! -I got it,l got it.

1137
01:05:34,448 --> 01:05:35,582
Hurry, find it quickly.

1138
01:05:35,616 --> 01:05:37,885
This smell...so why, why are you helping us?

1139
01:05:37,951 --> 01:05:41,088
-Ah. I'm really in it for the reward so I want you to win! -No, doesn't seem like it.

1140
01:05:42,656 --> 01:05:45,759
But we...oppa, I'm curious about what we do after we find this.

1141
01:05:45,826 --> 01:05:47,127
So what do we do after we find this?

1142
01:05:47,194 --> 01:05:48,362
We have to do something for sure.

1143
01:05:48,428 --> 01:05:50,564
-But where to go with this... -Hey. we don't know this.

1144
01:05:50,597 --> 01:05:52,399
Now you treat me like this.

1145
01:05:53,066 --> 01:05:54,167
You'll clearly regret it.

1146
01:05:54,201 --> 01:05:55,802
Hey, hey, then what do we do?

1147
01:05:55,869 --> 01:05:56,970
You were holding on to it.

1148
01:05:56,970 --> 01:05:58,171
You had one with you.

1149
01:05:58,305 --> 01:06:00,540
Hey, hey Kwang Soo, this is really true.

1150
01:06:00,707 --> 01:06:02,209
-If you were holding on to it, what would you do now? - Hey.

1151
01:06:02,276 --> 01:06:04,845
Why would I let you go, like a fool?

1152
01:06:05,245 --> 01:06:06,380
He's truly the hyung.

1153
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:08,548
Ah. it's a, it's a famous quote.

1154
01:06:08,582 --> 01:06:11,218
Oh, hyung has already apologized so many times.

1155
01:06:12,886 --> 01:06:13,987
Haha...

1156
01:06:15,789 --> 01:06:19,226
A person's greed seriously, knows no bounds.

1157
01:06:39,212 --> 01:06:42,749
As a special allowance. I'll give you a chance for revenge.

1158
01:06:42,849 --> 01:06:44,651
-Ok. - Will you accept this chance9

1159
01:06:44,718 --> 01:06:46,586
-We accept, we accept. -Of course, of course.

1160
01:06:46,687 --> 01:06:48,588
-Sure. sure. -We accept it.

1161
01:06:51,858 --> 01:06:52,826
Also.

1162
01:06:58,966 --> 01:06:59,766
This;

1163
01:07:07,741 --> 01:07:13,280
If you think you're in an extremely important situation, open this.

1164
01:07:13,847 --> 01:07:17,451
This might turn the tables of the battle for you guys.

1165
01:07:18,852 --> 01:07:20,187
-Turning the tables of the battle. -It's an advantage.

1166
01:07:20,187 --> 01:07:21,655
Turning the tables of the battle.

1167
01:07:21,989 --> 01:07:24,257
-This is too advantageous. -This is a reversal of the battle.

1168
01:07:24,257 --> 01:07:25,892
This is totally important.

1169
01:07:26,326 --> 01:07:27,027
Gae!

1170
01:07:27,027 --> 01:07:27,694
Gwang!

1171
01:07:27,828 --> 01:07:28,795
Cross!

1172
01:07:36,436 --> 01:07:37,471
Ok, now...

1173
01:07:42,275 --> 01:07:45,145
The final mission location, an ice rink.

1174
01:07:57,891 --> 01:07:59,092
Do you have a pocket?

1175
01:07:59,826 --> 01:08:01,728
You won't be separated from me right?

1176
01:08:03,997 --> 01:08:06,666
Never, lose this important item.

1177
01:08:25,152 --> 01:08:26,186
Come here, Kwang Soo.

1178
01:08:26,186 --> 01:08:27,487
-Hey Kwang Soo. -Come here.

1179
01:08:27,988 --> 01:08:30,757
Jeez, going here and there. What's all this, hyung?

1180
01:08:30,757 --> 01:08:32,292
I'm a free man, I can act freely!

1181
01:08:32,359 --> 01:08:34,327
-Kwang Soo. come here. -Come here, come here.

1182
01:08:34,494 --> 01:08:35,262
Cool off before you go.

1183
01:08:35,529 --> 01:08:37,097
-Cool what off? -Come here.

1184
01:08:37,097 --> 01:08:39,332
-Ah, after my pants were taken off. what's there still to cool off? -Come here, come here.

1185
01:08:39,366 --> 01:08:41,268
There can't he a division between people.

1186
01:08:42,002 --> 01:08:43,070
You're on our team.

1187
01:08:43,770 --> 01:08:45,272
-Come here. -This, this team?

1188
01:08:45,338 --> 01:08:46,006
Huh?

1189
01:08:46,239 --> 01:08:48,542
Wherever you go that won't change.

1190
01:08:48,708 --> 01:08:50,777
What colour clothing were you wearing in the morning?

1191
01:08:51,411 --> 01:08:51,912
Red.

1192
01:08:51,945 --> 01:08:53,280
-You see, you see. -That's right.

1193
01:08:53,747 --> 01:08:55,682
-Kwang Soo. why are you like this? -I'll give you that thing, that thing.

1194
01:08:55,782 --> 01:08:57,150
-Thinking about it. I... -It's a misunderstanding.

1195
01:08:57,150 --> 01:08:58,452
-Whatever happened in the morning... -Right.

1196
01:08:58,518 --> 01:08:59,686
It was just a happening.

1197
01:09:02,089 --> 01:09:02,589
Ok?

1198
01:09:03,156 --> 01:09:04,558
We're really sorry about earlier.

1199
01:09:04,558 --> 01:09:06,026
Well. Beom Soo hyung too...

1200
01:09:06,193 --> 01:09:08,061
We just wanted to get the upperhand.

1201
01:09:08,161 --> 01:09:08,695
That's right.

1202
01:09:08,695 --> 01:09:10,597
-I didn't know. - Ji Hyo, you too.

1203
01:09:10,664 --> 01:09:11,832
Kwang Soo, I'm sorry.

1204
01:09:11,898 --> 01:09:12,833
That's right.

1205
01:09:12,866 --> 01:09:13,934
The K word, the K word.

1206
01:09:14,067 --> 01:09:15,569
That's right, I should take this.

1207
01:09:16,970 --> 01:09:17,571
Huh?

1208
01:09:17,637 --> 01:09:19,039
Take this to the third and fourth floor.

1209
01:09:19,072 --> 01:09:20,040
These are...

1210
01:09:20,140 --> 01:09:23,710
-So. this is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6... -Are you sending me on an errand?

1211
01:09:25,912 --> 01:09:27,681
You're so funny.

1212
01:09:28,048 --> 01:09:31,118
Was Tom Cruise an errand boy in that movie? Hey, seriously.

1213
01:09:31,418 --> 01:09:34,488
Was Tom Cruise an errand boy in that movie? Hey, seriously.

1214
01:09:34,888 --> 01:09:39,426
Do you like doing that? Who will like it?

1215
01:09:48,702 --> 01:09:52,272
Ah, so you felt that way.-That's what you felt.

1216
01:09:54,241 --> 01:09:55,242
Really...

1217
01:09:56,309 --> 01:09:58,512
It's quite cool to be an errand boy then.

1218
01:09:58,612 --> 01:09:59,246
Got it?

1219
01:09:59,279 --> 01:10:01,948
-You're so cool today. - Hey. you're really...why are you so cool?

1220
01:10:03,850 --> 01:10:06,686
Do this action, like this. It's looks the same as 007.

1221
01:10:08,054 --> 01:10:11,558
Your face has the feel of a missionary.

1222
01:10:11,558 --> 01:10:13,827
There is no need to go to the fifth floor.

1223
01:10:13,827 --> 01:10:14,728
Because...

1224
01:10:14,728 --> 01:10:17,497
You phone is ringing. Have you been on the phone?

1225
01:10:17,497 --> 01:10:19,966
No, there was a recent phone call. It's Soo Hyun noona.

1226
01:10:19,966 --> 01:10:22,135
-There is a call now. -Pick it up, pick it up.

1227
01:10:22,135 --> 01:10:23,336
Noona!

1228
01:10:23,336 --> 01:10:25,105
Oh...

1229
01:10:25,105 --> 01:10:26,540
Where are you?

1230
01:10:26,540 --> 01:10:27,807
I am currently at...

1231
01:10:27,807 --> 01:10:29,176
First floor, first floor...

1232
01:10:29,609 --> 01:10:32,512
I am with the red team.

1233
01:10:32,512 --> 01:10:34,814
Why are you there? Come here, quickly.

1234
01:10:35,215 --> 01:10:37,017
Where, where?

1235
01:10:37,350 --> 01:10:38,985
Third floor.

1236
01:10:39,986 --> 01:10:43,356
The way noona is speaking... Third floor-' I like it a lot.

1237
01:10:45,592 --> 01:10:48,495
I will go to the third floor immediately.

1238
01:10:49,563 --> 01:10:52,766
This kid is already trapped. Trapped in love.

1239
01:10:54,467 --> 01:10:56,336
I remember a line.

1240
01:10:57,571 --> 01:10:59,940
Fall in love with the enemy's spy...

1241
01:11:00,740 --> 01:11:02,976
In the end, did the spy succeed?

1242
01:11:02,976 --> 01:11:04,010
Died!

1243
01:11:06,980 --> 01:11:12,018
-This is too much. This is really too much. -Kwang Soo, that's only a movie, only a movie.

1244
01:11:12,018 --> 01:11:14,087
I just need to complete the mission.

1245
01:11:14,087 --> 01:11:19,426
-That is only a movie, only the contents of the movie. -It is only the contents of the movie.

1246
01:11:19,426 --> 01:11:22,128
In 007, it is the bong-girl that will land you in trouble.

1247
01:11:22,128 --> 01:11:24,297
Today. Hong Soo Hyun is the Bbond Girl.

1248
01:11:24,297 --> 01:11:27,767
It's Bond Girl. What's Bbond Girl?

1249
01:11:27,767 --> 01:11:30,370
-Isn't it understood? -Kwang Soo, fighting!

1250
01:11:30,570 --> 01:11:32,806
-Kwang Soo. there is not much time. - Feel.

1251
01:11:32,806 --> 01:11:33,506
Feel.

1252
01:11:33,506 --> 01:11:34,841
Cross

1253
01:11:42,849 --> 01:11:47,387
Now, we found all that should be found right?

1254
01:11:47,387 --> 01:11:50,457
-Did it get stolen? -No, no...

1255
01:11:50,457 --> 01:11:52,492
Really?

1256
01:11:53,927 --> 01:11:55,996
Kwang Soo, you have been moving around secretively.

1257
01:11:56,029 --> 01:11:57,797
It's as if you are hiding from us.

1258
01:11:58,965 --> 01:12:01,368
You saw wrongly. It has nothing to do with me.

1259
01:12:01,368 --> 01:12:05,705
Why did we see it wrongly? Do you know how unnatural you are?

1260
01:12:08,441 --> 01:12:10,010
This is the better one...

1261
01:12:10,010 --> 01:12:13,046
'It has nothing to do with me.'

1262
01:12:13,046 --> 01:12:14,981
Kwang Soo is like that right now, just like that.

1263
01:12:14,981 --> 01:12:17,150
What should we do?

1264
01:12:18,451 --> 01:12:22,389
-Stop the fight. -During the call, where were;you?

1265
01:12:22,389 --> 01:12:24,157
What are you going to do? Quick.

1266
01:12:28,995 --> 01:12:30,397
Did you see that?

1267
01:12:30,897 --> 01:12:34,301
-I know something. -What?

1268
01:12:34,301 --> 01:12:36,870
-I know something. -What do you know?

1269
01:12:36,870 --> 01:12:40,440
I want to know which team is more advantageous before helping that team.

1270
01:12:40,440 --> 01:12:42,909
If you snatch it, we will give you the prize.

1271
01:12:42,909 --> 01:12:44,110
Quickly go snatch it.

1272
01:12:44,110 --> 01:12:47,681
It is easy for you to go there. Snatch it within 5 minutes.

1273
01:12:47,681 --> 01:12:50,350
-Then hyung, I have to bring something there. -Quickly return after snatching it.

1274
01:12:50,350 --> 01:12:52,352
Bring Soo Hyun's heart there.

1275
01:13:06,633 --> 01:13:08,601
Wait a while.

1276
01:13:08,601 --> 01:13:11,371
Stop recording first.

1277
01:13:14,341 --> 01:13:15,975
Is it obvious?

1278
01:13:16,910 --> 01:13:19,379
Is it obvious? It's not obvious right?

1279
01:13:23,316 --> 01:13:27,087
Now we need to snatch those over, really.

1280
01:13:27,087 --> 01:13:30,256
We need to know the final location.snatch those over and rush over there.

1281
01:13:30,256 --> 01:13:34,828
Those two persons seem to know the final location.

1282
01:13:35,895 --> 01:13:40,367
Give Gary 50 percent of the prize.

1283
01:13:40,367 --> 01:13:42,202
To"let him reveal the final location.

1284
01:13:42,202 --> 01:13:43,570
Let‘s ask.

1285
01:13:43,570 --> 01:13:46,039
Gary! Come here for a while.

1286
01:13:46,039 --> 01:13:47,407
It's really tiring.

1287
01:13:47,407 --> 01:13:48,508
Gary.

1288
01:13:49,342 --> 01:13:54,080
We will give you a bigger share of the prize.

1289
01:13:54,347 --> 01:13:58,451
If you tell us where we should go this game will end immediately.

1290
01:13:58,451 --> 01:14:01,187
We are helping you too. What do yon think?

1291
01:14:02,489 --> 01:14:04,591
Ah, I get it.

1292
01:14:05,158 --> 01:14:15,101
Let's go to 'a place where you will slip on the iceT

1293
01:14:15,835 --> 01:14:17,570
Are there-a?iy here?

1294
01:14:17,570 --> 01:14:19,172
There should be.

1295
01:14:20,106 --> 01:14:22,041
A place where the ice is slippery.

1296
01:14:22,041 --> 01:14:24,377
Ice rink!

1297
01:14:35,155 --> 01:14:38,057
What are you doing up there? Come down!

1298
01:14:38,057 --> 01:14:41,027
We are making a decision now.

1299
01:14:41,027 --> 01:14:44,364
So, just like what we were saying just now.

1300
01:14:44,364 --> 01:14:46,766
We need each other.

1301
01:14:46,766 --> 01:14:51,070
Let's make a bet using the piece and decide using flip the paper game.

1302
01:14:51,070 --> 01:14:54,941
So the two teams are ending it here once and for ail right?

1303
01:14:54,941 --> 01:14:56,709
Good, come down.

1304
01:15:02,515 --> 01:15:04,684
Quickly pass it to him.

1305
01:15:06,586 --> 01:15:09,255
Let go. 1,2,3.

1306
01:15:16,796 --> 01:15:21,201
There are 10 minutes left to the end of the mission.

1307
01:15:32,212 --> 01:15:35,448
Let's go straight away now.

1308
01:15:40,286 --> 01:15:43,256
Quickly, quickly.

1309
01:15:44,657 --> 01:15:48,127
Kwang Soo, come quickly.

1310
01:15:48,228 --> 01:15:50,663
They ran away.

1311
01:15:55,735 --> 01:15:58,505
Hey, hey hey!

1312
01:16:02,408 --> 01:16:06,579
Soo Hyun, quickly stop them! Soo Hyun, quickly stop them!

1313
01:16:08,348 --> 01:16:10,450
Kwang Soo! Run quickly!

1314
01:16:15,855 --> 01:16:17,891
Where are we going?

1315
01:16:19,526 --> 01:16:20,793
Where is it?

1316
01:16:20,793 --> 01:16:22,195
Do you really know?

1317
01:16:24,197 --> 01:16:27,634
Ah, really! Making use of others' trust!

1318
01:16:28,368 --> 01:16:30,069
It seems like we know the final location!

1319
01:16:30,069 --> 01:16:30,870
We know it.

1320
01:16:30,870 --> 01:16:32,105
You know it?

1321
01:16:39,312 --> 01:16:41,347
Hey, hey! Where is it?

1322
01:16:43,049 --> 01:16:45,451
Come here quickly! Come here quickly!

1323
01:16:45,451 --> 01:16:47,387
Hyung, what about that paper?

1324
01:17:10,510 --> 01:17:12,712
Soo Hyun, hold on to them.

1325
01:17:12,712 --> 01:17:15,481
Where is the key? Take it out quickly!

1326
01:17:18,251 --> 01:17:20,687
Hey, take it out quickly!

1327
01:17:20,687 --> 01:17:24,057
It's with hyung! Search Gary hyung! Search Gary hyung!

1328
01:17:39,539 --> 01:17:41,507
Do you prefer a son or daughter?

1329
01:17:44,777 --> 01:17:47,080
It's funny.

1330
01:17:52,018 --> 01:17:53,486
Isn't it this?

1331
01:18:09,969 --> 01:18:12,472
Oppa, come here quickly!

1332
01:18:13,640 --> 01:18:15,775

Quickly paste them!

1334
01:19:10,229 --> 01:19:11,964
How do we do this?

1335
01:19:47,967 --> 01:19:49,202
Why did you do that?

1336
01:19:51,471 --> 01:19:53,439
Here, here!

1337
01:19:55,808 --> 01:19:57,944

01:20:15,595 --> 01:20:17,864
Well done, well done!

1339
01:20:22,835 --> 01:20:26,439
-To put it accurately, there is another person who helped us. -That's right.

1340
01:20:26,439 --> 01:20:30,510
The prize for the team who won is superior grade Korean beef.

1341
01:20:31,711 --> 01:20:33,946
The team that won just needs to take it.

1342
01:20:33,946 --> 01:20:39,118
-if you recognize their contribution, you c.1 n transfer the prize. -Ah, no.

1343
01:20:40,620 --> 01:20:41,821
Thank you!

1344
01:20:41,821 --> 01:20:44,791
-Ah! This... -Ah, we did that to let you all in!

1345
01:20:50,429 --> 01:20:53,266
It's fine if Ji Hyo eats it with me.
