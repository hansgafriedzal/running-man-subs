1
00:00:37,488 --> 00:00:38,723
What is this?

2
00:00:54,605 --> 00:00:59,343
You are invited onto a treasure ship.

3
00:00:59,377 --> 00:01:02,279
Find the treasure hidden on the treasure ship and become its owner.

4
00:01:02,313 --> 00:01:07,485
Take tomorrow's 8AM flight to Cusan and come to the following address.

5
00:01:08,853 --> 00:01:10,654
Go to Busan?

6
00:01:14,158 --> 00:01:15,926
That Busan in the south?

7
00:01:21,365 --> 00:01:24,168
You didn't hang something on the doors this time?

8
00:01:24,201 --> 00:01:26,904
Like that time in Hong Kong.

9
00:01:31,208 --> 00:01:32,610
Is it an individual competition?

10
00:01:33,577 --> 00:01:35,112
This is strange.

11
00:01:35,179 --> 00:01:37,014
It's a treasure ship? A treasure ship?

12
00:01:37,048 --> 00:01:38,916
Is this it?

13
00:01:39,016 --> 00:01:40,885
I can just go back in?

14
00:01:41,786 --> 00:01:43,754
There's no mission for me?

15
00:01:44,488 --> 00:01:45,689
OK.

16
00:01:53,531 --> 00:01:54,565
Never trust anyone...

17
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:59,236
Find the culprit

18
00:01:59,336 --> 00:02:00,337
The culprit is...

19
00:02:00,337 --> 00:02:01,272
I think the culprit is...

20
00:02:01,305 --> 00:02:02,573
Among us!

21
00:02:02,606 --> 00:02:04,008
No!

22
00:02:04,108 --> 00:02:06,477
-It's you! -You are the culprit!

23
00:02:19,457 --> 00:02:21,392
Nuna, hi.

24
00:02:22,693 --> 00:02:24,161
It's a good morning.

25
00:02:25,029 --> 00:02:27,832
I couldn't sleep a wink.

26
00:02:31,936 --> 00:02:34,605
What are you planning now.

27
00:02:34,672 --> 00:02:37,108
Your face is swollen.

28
00:02:37,174 --> 00:02:39,176
What did you eat before bed?

29
00:02:40,211 --> 00:02:41,679
A cup ramen.

30
00:02:48,119 --> 00:02:50,321
Ah! This is ...

31
00:02:50,387 --> 00:02:52,356
It makes me happy no matter how many times I look at it.

32
00:02:54,291 --> 00:02:57,128
Why give me this on TV, making me embarrassed.

33
00:03:03,534 --> 00:03:06,837
Hello.

34
00:03:06,871 --> 00:03:09,173
-You all brought your invitations, right? -Yes.

35
00:03:10,107 --> 00:03:12,376
Then we'll get going now, To the airport.

36
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:14,678
The airport is right there.

37
00:03:14,712 --> 00:03:17,748
Then we'll get there. It won't even take 10 minutes. Please take your belongings.

38
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:25,089
-Wow, is this that... -Oh, this is here, too.

39
00:03:26,257 --> 00:03:30,094
This is like Incheon Ariport...

40
00:03:30,161 --> 00:03:32,263
Daebak! Daebak!

41
00:03:36,033 --> 00:03:38,335
-It's the airport now. -Oh, it really is!

42
00:03:38,369 --> 00:03:40,704
It's the airport!

43
00:03:44,008 --> 00:03:45,109
This is amazing.

44
00:03:52,516 --> 00:03:53,984
Wow, we're in Busan.

45
00:03:54,051 --> 00:03:56,253
In the blink of an eye. It's Busan.

46
00:03:56,287 --> 00:03:57,988
It's Busan.

47
00:03:58,055 --> 00:04:00,324
Where will it be? I'm curious.

48
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,328
Oh? What's that?

49
00:04:13,704 --> 00:04:14,338
Oh? What?

50
00:04:17,808 --> 00:04:18,742
What?

51
00:04:20,911 --> 00:04:22,846
-I was here! -Hey!

52
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,381
-Hey, get out. -Kwang Soo...

53
00:04:24,448 --> 00:04:26,417
You can't stick yourself in here from the side.

54
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:28,419
And I had come out early.

55
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:30,788
Yes, yes, yes!

56
00:04:31,622 --> 00:04:32,690
Please go that way.

57
00:04:35,392 --> 00:04:38,229
-Yes. -Kwang Soo cut in from the side.

58
00:04:40,998 --> 00:04:42,700
We're late, we're late!

59
00:04:42,766 --> 00:04:45,135
Hey! I'm first!

60
00:04:47,638 --> 00:04:49,240
Wait. Where's the car?

61
00:04:50,074 --> 00:04:52,509
Ah, this will take a whlie. Where is it?

62
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:54,979
What is it? Which is it?

63
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,481
Where is it?

64
00:04:58,682 --> 00:05:00,017
Come out! K.U.T.T!

65
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:02,953
It must be this one!

66
00:05:03,687 --> 00:05:05,189
See!

67
00:05:05,256 --> 00:05:06,757
Wait, wait. Please only one person press at a time!

68
00:05:07,758 --> 00:05:09,360
It's here! I found it!

69
00:05:14,431 --> 00:05:15,633
Wow, what luck!

70
00:05:19,603 --> 00:05:21,639
Oh, it's right. It's my car.

71
00:05:23,574 --> 00:05:24,575
It's this one.

72
00:05:26,677 --> 00:05:27,878
This one, this one!

73
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,148
It must be this one!

74
00:05:31,615 --> 00:05:32,983
It's this one.

75
00:05:34,018 --> 00:05:34,918
Wait a minute.

76
00:05:35,686 --> 00:05:39,490
What we got at dawn... I just need to go to this address, right?

77
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:47,598
Busan, Saha-gu, Cupyeong-dong 495-31 Orient Dockyard.

78
00:05:47,665 --> 00:05:50,934
OK. Let's go! I'm going to leave first!

79
00:05:53,037 --> 00:05:55,139
I think I'm the first right now.

80
00:05:55,205 --> 00:05:58,042
Find a treasure ship? A treasure ship...?

81
00:05:58,842 --> 00:06:00,978
Hey, what is this?

82
00:06:01,045 --> 00:06:02,646
What will today be about?

83
00:06:02,713 --> 00:06:05,616
What's going on all of a sudden? I can't get my mind straight.

84
00:06:06,417 --> 00:06:08,986
It seems to be individual competitions today.

85
00:06:09,453 --> 00:06:11,255
We haven't split into team, so it much be individual.

86
00:06:11,755 --> 00:06:14,792
Maybe we'll be put into teams in the order we arrive?

87
00:06:15,859 --> 00:06:20,297
You think we're being invited to a party? Like from the old show Detective Kim Jeon...?

88
00:06:20,731 --> 00:06:22,099
We'll be invited and...

89
00:06:33,544 --> 00:06:37,348
OK, I have a good record until now.

90
00:06:44,588 --> 00:06:46,256
Wow, what is this?!

91
00:06:47,091 --> 00:06:48,492
Wow, this is no joke!

92
00:06:58,802 --> 00:07:00,971
It looks bigger than what we were on last time... Oh!

93
00:07:03,307 --> 00:07:04,842
I'm first?

94
00:07:08,512 --> 00:07:09,847
Am I first?

95
00:07:11,949 --> 00:07:13,250
I'm first?

96
00:07:13,851 --> 00:07:14,952
Buon Giorno (Good day).

97
00:07:15,419 --> 00:07:16,153
Cuse me?

98
00:07:17,087 --> 00:07:20,290
That ship you see over there is the treasure ship that came from Italy.

99
00:07:20,357 --> 00:07:21,892
-Oh, really? -Yes.

100
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:29,900
First, wear this manteau.

101
00:07:31,769 --> 00:07:32,636
Oh, really?

102
00:07:32,703 --> 00:07:35,506
Wear that and you need to get on that small tugboat.

103
00:07:38,776 --> 00:07:40,144
Ah, hyung, we'll go first!

104
00:07:40,177 --> 00:07:42,212
Bye!

105
00:07:44,581 --> 00:07:45,849
Ah,it's green again.

106
00:07:49,353 --> 00:07:50,921
He's here.  He's here.

107
00:07:50,954 --> 00:07:52,556
Ah! It's leaving!

108
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:55,125
Out!

109
00:07:58,395 --> 00:08:00,197
Why do you get so started easily these days?

110
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:07,237
This isn't something that'll let us fly through the air?

111
00:08:08,772 --> 00:08:10,574
I fell in water once...

112
00:08:10,607 --> 00:08:12,709
But I was saved by this clothing.

113
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:53,016
Welcome. Mr Lee Kwang Soo, please go up first.

114
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:53,951
-Eh? Separately? -One by one?

115
00:09:01,859 --> 00:09:03,660
Wow, there are 7 floors.

116
00:09:04,428 --> 00:09:05,829
Marina.

117
00:09:06,997 --> 00:09:11,235
Miss Blank?

118
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:14,771
-Careful. -Thank you.

119
00:09:22,546 --> 00:09:24,648

00:09:39,062 --> 00:09:39,997
Kwang Soo, Kwang Soo.

124
00:09:41,598 --> 00:09:42,633

125
00:09:42,699 --> 00:09:44,401
Oh! Chao chao!

126
00:09:45,269 --> 00:09:47,204
Oh, if it's a Hao chao...!

127
00:09:47,237 --> 00:09:49,239
Lee Seung Hwan, hao!

128
00:10:09,126 --> 00:10:12,629
If we get all of this right, please let us go on Running Man.

129
00:10:14,064 --> 00:10:16,266
-Would you like to try? -Please promise!!

130
00:10:19,269 --> 00:10:20,671
Kwang Soo, Kwang Soo.

00:10:25,842 --> 00:10:27,110

132
00:10:28,445 --> 00:10:29,846
The invitation is in my car...

133
00:10:31,782 --> 00:10:33,083
Go back down.

134
00:10:33,817 --> 00:10:35,018
-Eh? -Go back down.

135
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,487
Go back down.

136
00:10:38,855 --> 00:10:42,292
GO BACK DOWN!

137
00:10:45,028 --> 00:10:46,363
Do I have to get on the boat and go back?

138
00:10:49,533 --> 00:10:51,368
Invitation is necessary.

139
00:10:52,703 --> 00:10:54,538
What, I really... Really?

140
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,408
Really? But my invitation is really in the car.

141
00:11:00,711 --> 00:11:02,145
What? We really have to go back?

142
00:11:16,493 --> 00:11:18,428
We've especially readied brunch for you all.

143
00:11:30,874 --> 00:11:32,009
Thank you. Follow me.

144
00:11:32,976 --> 00:11:34,478
It was difficult, wasn't it?

145
00:11:35,212 --> 00:11:36,813
-Yes? It was difficult, wasn't it?

146
00:11:37,314 --> 00:11:38,015

-Hopper, hopper. -Oh, Yoo Jae Suk sunbaenim.

168

00:13:01,998 --> 00:13:04,334
-Any personal talents? -Oh, he's asking if you have any personal talents.

170
00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:05,769
I don't really have any talents.

171
00:13:06,803 --> 00:13:08,438
Please show us something.

172
00:13:09,339 --> 00:13:10,841
What should I do?

00:13:10,907 --> 00:13:13,977
-The Dooly dance! -Ah, but that's been such a long time ago.

00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:15,479
Grasshopper dance. Rabbit dance.

00:13:15,545 --> 00:13:17,114
But I've done the grasshopper dance so often.

00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:18,315
Do something already!

177
00:13:18,381 --> 00:13:20,383

-You! You! -Me?

-You won! -Really?

191
00:14:05,962 --> 00:14:09,766
But because we're the hubae comedians, if you could take a commemorative photo with us?

192
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:17,174
-Oh, but... the trophy you won... -Oh, the trophy? I bring that around with me.

193
00:14:17,274 --> 00:14:19,176
Why are you taking that trophy around with you?!

194
00:14:21,278 --> 00:14:23,814
-Because I do! -Really?

195
00:14:25,448 --> 00:14:27,617
OH. oooh

196
00:14:28,852 --> 00:14:30,720
Wow, tr-ro-phy!

197
00:14:30,787 --> 00:14:32,055
OK, please come up here.

198
00:14:33,857 --> 00:14:37,294
What? But the trophy disappeared...

199
00:14:39,129 --> 00:14:40,130
What?

200
00:14:42,933 --> 00:14:44,100
It disappeared?

201
00:14:44,134 --> 00:14:44,901
But hyung, you had your bag with you the whole time.

202
00:14:44,935 --> 00:14:46,369
-I did... -Look carefully!

203
00:14:46,403 --> 00:14:48,004
Where did the trophy go?

204
00:14:48,071 --> 00:14:49,372
Really?

205
00:14:49,406 --> 00:14:50,874
It really disappeared.

206
00:14:51,741 --> 00:14:53,009
Was it in there originally? When you received it?

207
00:14:53,076 --> 00:14:54,945
-Of course it was. -Really?

208
00:14:54,978 --> 00:14:57,047
-But it's really gone? -But, how could it disappear?

209
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,683
Then... We'll just take the picture with this...

210
00:15:01,384 --> 00:15:02,352
Do that for now.

211
00:15:02,419 --> 00:15:04,354
-Take it for now. -It's weird.

212
00:15:05,388 --> 00:15:06,990
-OK. -Yes, yes, here.

213
00:15:13,797 --> 00:15:14,965
-Thank you. -You're kind of cut off.

214
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:17,634
Originally, where...?

215
00:15:19,502 --> 00:15:22,205
-Did you see it on the plane? -Yeah, on the plane.

216
00:15:28,078 --> 00:15:33,016
-But hyung! You carried the bag nearly the whole time. -Exactly, I definitely was carrying the bag. Because it's precious.

217
00:15:38,054 --> 00:15:39,723
Did someone take it? Was it you?

218
00:15:39,756 --> 00:15:41,858
-I have my own! -The culprit is within us!

219
00:15:42,325 --> 00:15:44,761
-In my mind, the culprit is... Kwang Soo. -You...

220
00:15:44,828 --> 00:15:46,763
-Hyung! -Kwang Soo, it's you!

221
00:15:46,796 --> 00:15:49,733
-But hyung! I went back with Gary hyung to get my invitation. -That's why it's you.

222
00:15:49,766 --> 00:15:53,970
No. The culprit is... Ji Suk Jin. It's a self-fabricated scenario!

223
00:15:54,004 --> 00:15:56,039
-What are you talking about! -Oh! So you could get another one?!

224
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:59,009
-You created this self-fabricated scenario to get another one, didn't you?! -Hey!

225
00:15:59,042 --> 00:16:00,343
Look at his expression!

226
00:16:00,377 --> 00:16:01,778
Why would I self-fabricated scenario?

227
00:16:01,811 --> 00:16:04,014
But if someone took it, there's no way that absolutely no one know.

228
00:16:04,414 --> 00:16:05,982
-You are the culprit! -It's you!

229
00:16:06,049 --> 00:16:07,317
What? It's you!

230
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:09,686
-It's you! You! -It's you! You!

231
00:16:10,186 --> 00:16:14,691
OK, then. There might be someone who has a grudge against Suk Jin hyung right now, so...

232
00:16:14,724 --> 00:16:17,093
Exactly. Was that perhaps pure gold? Pure gold?

233
00:16:18,161 --> 00:16:19,596
But that has no meaning. Why would anyone...

234
00:16:19,663 --> 00:16:21,998
It's a bit more expensive than a regular daesang trophy.

235
00:16:22,032 --> 00:16:23,566
See, it's expensive.

236
00:16:23,633 --> 00:16:25,001
-But, who would. -It was very heavy, you see.

237
00:16:25,068 --> 00:16:26,870
But how could that be more expensive than the daesang trophy?

238
00:16:29,306 --> 00:16:30,340
-Yeah, but... -Oh!

239
00:16:30,373 --> 00:16:31,942
-That's why it's you! -Yeah.

240
00:16:31,975 --> 00:16:33,576
You are the culprit!

241
00:16:33,643 --> 00:16:35,178
-Yoo Jae Suk! -I learned that fact just now!

242
00:16:35,211 --> 00:16:39,983
I saw your facial expression darkening as you said that it was more expensive than a daesang trophy!

243
00:16:40,016 --> 00:16:42,085
Why? Did you want it that much?

244
00:16:42,852 --> 00:16:44,988
-But do we have to find this trophy? -Your eyes definitely shifted.

245
00:16:45,021 --> 00:16:46,790
Can't we just forger it?

246
00:16:46,856 --> 00:16:50,727
-Must we talk about the trophy for two, there hours? -Hey, find it for me.

247
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:54,998
-What did you say? -But hyung! The trophy...

248
00:16:55,031 --> 00:16:57,534
-We came to find treasure. -Look all the doors!

249
00:17:02,372 --> 00:17:03,540
...Great detective.

250
00:17:03,606 --> 00:17:06,576
We know this would happen to we, the Hao Chao team invited a master detective.

251
00:17:07,644 --> 00:17:09,145
Please come out!

252
00:17:27,597 --> 00:17:29,666
-Oh! Do Hyun and Jedong Hyung! How...

253
00:17:35,638 --> 00:17:37,707
Rock and roll baby!

254
00:17:38,675 --> 00:17:40,176
Rock and roll!

255
00:17:40,744 --> 00:17:42,445
Oh, seeing everyone here is very welcoming.

256
00:17:42,512 --> 00:17:44,581
-Oh, but... -Hello.

257
00:17:45,849 --> 00:17:47,350
-We came to find you your trophy. -Precisely.

258
00:17:47,417 --> 00:17:49,519
-Sherlook Holmes? -Yes.

259
00:17:49,586 --> 00:17:50,487
-How? -How?

260
00:17:51,121 --> 00:17:52,255
Oh, you brought something.

261
00:17:52,655 --> 00:17:54,624
-But it's the same colour as your clothes so... -What, you're detective, but you don't have a notepad?

262
00:17:54,657 --> 00:17:56,626
-A detective must always have a notepad. -Is that so? -Of course.

263
00:17:56,659 --> 00:17:57,927
Oh, a detective notepad...

264
00:17:57,994 --> 00:18:00,130
Detective Rule No.1

265
00:18:04,267 --> 00:18:05,468
-No.1 -Yes?

266
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:08,004
The crime.. crim...

267
00:18:11,441 --> 00:18:12,976
At the scene of the crime...

268
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:14,544
procure the evidence.

269
00:18:15,745 --> 00:18:18,815
I think we need to get some fingerprints.

270
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:20,350
-Fingerprints? -Yes.

271
00:18:21,384 --> 00:18:22,318
With a brush...

272
00:18:22,886 --> 00:18:24,387
-...The trophy case... -A brush?

273
00:18:24,421 --> 00:18:26,089
-That part was what you had to do. -Oh, right.

274
00:18:26,156 --> 00:18:28,691
-With a brush, did you say? -A brush.

275
00:18:28,758 --> 00:18:30,727
-Oh, a brush! -Do we have one?

276
00:18:30,794 --> 00:18:32,796
-You didn't bring it? -Yes.

277
00:18:32,829 --> 00:18:35,665
What trophy will these people find for me?!

278
00:18:38,368 --> 00:18:39,602
Go find the trophy quickly.

279
00:18:39,636 --> 00:18:41,571
-You know where it is. -What are you doing? -I'll go find it.

280
00:18:42,472 --> 00:18:43,873
-You know where it is? -Where it is?

281
00:18:43,907 --> 00:18:45,208
I found it.

282
00:18:45,275 --> 00:18:47,043
-Where? -Where?

283
00:18:47,577 --> 00:18:48,745
It's in the chao chao's costume.

284
00:18:48,778 --> 00:18:50,647
-What? -You found the trophy? -Yes.

285
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,982
-You found it already? -Is it OK for you to suddenly find it like this, hyungnim?

286
00:18:53,817 --> 00:18:55,385
-It's really there! -Oh!

287
00:18:55,452 --> 00:18:55,952
Oh, it's true.

288
00:18:56,019 --> 00:18:57,220
When did it get in there?

289
00:18:57,253 --> 00:18:58,521
See, I found it.

290
00:18:58,588 --> 00:19:00,924
I'm a master detective.

291
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:02,659
Hey, Mr.Jesong Se Hyaop.

292
00:19:08,531 --> 00:19:10,433
Why is Jedong just standing there not doing anything?

293
00:19:10,467 --> 00:19:11,234
Say what?

294
00:19:11,267 --> 00:19:13,770
I thought you would say something! Why are you not doing anything?

295
00:19:14,704 --> 00:19:17,273
-Why are you squabbing? -Why are you getting angry?

296
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:19,909
-But... -No...

297
00:19:22,212 --> 00:19:23,146
Never trust anyone.

298
00:19:24,247 --> 00:19:26,182
Oh! Hyung!

299
00:19:26,216 --> 00:19:28,218
Kim Jong Kook!

300
00:19:29,752 --> 00:19:31,020
Noooo!

301
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:35,425
-What's this? -Quickly! Quickly!

302
00:19:37,327 --> 00:19:39,195
Find the culprit.

303
00:19:40,797 --> 00:19:43,533
We will now start the treasure hunt.

304
00:19:43,566 --> 00:19:44,567
That's right.

305
00:19:44,601 --> 00:19:46,269
-Treasure hunt. -The mission we received yesterday was a treasure hunt.

306
00:19:46,336 --> 00:19:48,004
That's right, treasure. This is a treasure ship.

307
00:19:48,037 --> 00:19:50,773
This ship needs set in February.

308
00:19:51,574 --> 00:19:54,711
But the captain of the ship said he lost a treasure.

309
00:20:07,357 --> 00:20:11,427
And he said he the person who finds the treasure can keep it.

310
00:20:11,494 --> 00:20:13,229
Oh, really?

311
00:20:13,329 --> 00:20:14,297
What?!

312
00:20:14,364 --> 00:20:16,966
So, the captain is saying if we find the treasure we can...

313
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,469
Perhaps... the treasure is hid daughter? His daughter?

314
00:20:19,936 --> 00:20:21,738
Oh, Chao chao!

315
00:20:21,804 --> 00:20:23,406
-Chao chao! -Oh?

316
00:20:23,439 --> 00:20:27,110
Chao chao!Chao chao.

317
00:20:27,177 --> 00:20:28,578
Chao chao!

318
00:20:35,752 --> 00:20:38,221
Oh, Mr,Do Hyun, you're going to the 4th floor.

319
00:20:46,462 --> 00:20:48,765
Oh, you're 5th floor, Room 302. I think I shall go in first.

320
00:20:48,798 --> 00:20:51,334
Oh, yeah, sure, do that!

321
00:20:51,367 --> 00:20:53,803
Since you already know, I'll go now.

322
00:20:55,838 --> 00:20:59,142
-And there are hints regarding this treasure hidden throughout this ship. -Ah, there are hints.

323
00:20:59,175 --> 00:21:00,176
Is that so?

324
00:21:00,677 --> 00:21:03,012
-It's a hint card looks like this. -Oh, the Death Note!

325
00:21:08,418 --> 00:21:10,620
-And we'll confiscate all your cell phones. -What?

326
00:21:18,294 --> 00:21:20,230
OK, you can get doing now.

327
00:21:20,296 --> 00:21:22,065
Woow!

328
00:21:22,098 --> 00:21:24,067
Let's go!

329
00:21:24,067 --> 00:21:25,101
You have to follow them. Quickly now.

330
00:21:25,134 --> 00:21:26,336
Now. Start!

331
00:21:26,469 --> 00:21:28,471
Woow!

332
00:21:29,939 --> 00:21:31,574
-Mine on the 6th floor. -Can we take the elevator?

333
00:21:31,608 --> 00:21:33,676
-What floor is this? -What floor is this again?

334
00:21:34,277 --> 00:21:35,078
We're on the 6th floor here.

335
00:21:35,144 --> 00:21:36,779
-Oh, this is the 8th floor. -This is the 6th floor?

336
00:21:37,814 --> 00:21:39,582
Wow, this is really long.

337
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:41,985
Hey, we might get lost here.

338
00:21:44,254 --> 00:21:45,421
Is this it?

339
00:21:46,489 --> 00:21:47,757
Oh! Kim Jong Kook.

340
00:21:53,229 --> 00:21:55,465
Ah, my name tag is here.OK

341
00:22:04,907 --> 00:22:08,044
Hints regarding the location of the treasure are hidden throughout the ship.

342
00:22:11,648 --> 00:22:14,717
Acquire the hints and become the owner the owner of the treasure.

343
00:22:15,618 --> 00:22:17,287
There can only on owner of the treasure.

344
00:22:17,353 --> 00:22:18,955
Never trust anyone.

345
00:22:19,422 --> 00:22:21,658
There are hints hidden throughout the ship.

346
00:22:22,125 --> 00:22:23,893
Will you stick this on for me?

347
00:22:29,766 --> 00:22:31,901
Please stick it well. So that it's hard to take off.

348
00:23:19,782 --> 00:23:21,517
Wow, but this ship is really big!

349
00:23:22,185 --> 00:23:26,289
I think... we may be around here right now.

350
00:23:32,028 --> 00:23:34,430
I... I'm looking for the mission.

351
00:23:36,265 --> 00:23:38,835
Wow this place.. There are so many rooms!

352
00:23:41,704 --> 00:23:43,940
Ah, it's an individual competition.

353
00:23:51,381 --> 00:23:53,116
You can't escape from my clutches.

354
00:23:55,218 --> 00:23:57,787
Looking from the angle, it's a around here somewhere.

355
00:23:57,887 --> 00:24:00,390
The angle is definitely pointing to here!

356
00:24:08,297 --> 00:24:11,167
First. I lost this time as well.

357
00:24:13,269 --> 00:24:15,571
-But there was no word about tearing off name tags. -There didn't need to be.

358
00:24:15,671 --> 00:24:16,739
Mr. Do Hyun.

359
00:24:18,074 --> 00:24:20,176
Talking about tearing off name tags... What are you two doing?

360
00:24:20,810 --> 00:24:22,879
Both of you are very suspicions. Why are you acting like this?

361
00:24:25,148 --> 00:24:27,216
There was no word bout tearing off name tags...

362
00:24:27,483 --> 00:24:29,685
There's a movie that comes to mind after looking at you two.

363
00:24:29,719 --> 00:24:30,953
Which?

364
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:32,422
Dumb and Dumber.

365
00:24:33,122 --> 00:24:34,056
You're one to talk.

366
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:36,492
You just crashed into that while walking backwards.

367
00:24:36,526 --> 00:24:38,027
You just look that way.

368
00:24:45,435 --> 00:24:46,369
Wow.

369
00:24:47,403 --> 00:24:48,738
Wooow

370
00:24:49,539 --> 00:24:50,940
Why are you following me?

371
00:24:51,474 --> 00:24:52,708
-I'm just passing by! -What...?

372
00:24:56,779 --> 00:25:01,684
The structure of this ship is steady being stored in my mind.

373
00:25:02,885 --> 00:25:04,654
Into my computer-like brain.

374
00:25:04,687 --> 00:25:08,624
I'm thoroughly searching through this ship with my brain with an IQ of 250.

375
00:25:08,791 --> 00:25:10,560
My eyes see in 4D!

376
00:25:10,626 --> 00:25:11,994
I can see everything!

377
00:25:13,262 --> 00:25:15,565
I cannot let this be! We must go back to where we were an hour ago.

378
00:25:16,199 --> 00:25:17,967
The one who rewinds time!

379
00:25:18,034 --> 00:25:19,502
The one who controls space!

380
00:25:22,071 --> 00:25:23,739
Hey!

381
00:25:25,641 --> 00:25:29,946
Wow, these lifeboats...

382
00:25:30,012 --> 00:25:32,582
Hey! Mr.Do Hyun! I told you, we can't go around together like this.

383
00:25:32,648 --> 00:25:34,517
What, no. I just came here myself.

384
00:25:36,252 --> 00:25:37,987
Mr.Do Hyun! Try to look for it carefully!

385
00:25:38,054 --> 00:25:39,522
Yes, yes...

386
00:25:40,423 --> 00:25:42,158
I really like you a lot, Mr.Do Hyun!

387
00:25:42,191 --> 00:25:43,526
Same here!

388
00:25:56,739 --> 00:25:58,474
Wow, this is really breathtaking.

389
00:26:58,067 --> 00:26:59,201
Hyung!

390
00:26:59,969 --> 00:27:01,671
-What? -Did you find a hint?

391
00:27:01,737 --> 00:27:03,306
No...

392
00:27:03,339 --> 00:27:04,907
-Oh, but,,, -No, this isn't it.

393
00:27:04,941 --> 00:27:06,142
You found something didn't you?

394
00:27:06,208 --> 00:27:07,677
You're actually not supposed to be finding hints, Kwang Soo.

395
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:09,378
Hyung, we can work together.

396
00:27:09,445 --> 00:27:10,413
With what?

397
00:27:10,479 --> 00:27:12,315
You can share hints!

398
00:27:12,348 --> 00:27:15,885
Because I have something very crucial...

399
00:27:20,056 --> 00:27:22,191
-Really? -Hmm?

400
00:27:22,558 --> 00:27:24,126
Let's get moving for now.

401
00:27:24,827 --> 00:27:27,663
-And keep it a secret. -Hyung...!

402
00:27:28,331 --> 00:27:29,732
Hyung, what do you have?

403
00:27:29,765 --> 00:27:32,668
I... have nothing to fear.

404
00:27:33,502 --> 00:27:35,805
Then why don't we ass our information together?

405
00:27:35,838 --> 00:27:38,174
But hyung, why are you OK?

406
00:27:38,207 --> 00:27:41,077
-What have, with what you have... -Hyung, what do you have.

407
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:42,912
-If you bring something... -Do you have something?

408
00:27:42,945 --> 00:27:45,848
No matter what you find , you  need to have what I have .

409
00:27:45,915 --> 00:27:48,451
-In the middle ,I... -Oh!

410
00:27:48,517 --> 00:27:49,719
Suk Jin hyung!

411
00:27:49,752 --> 00:27:50,586
Suk Jin out,Suk Jin out.

412
00:27:59,895 --> 00:28:01,030
Suk Jin hyung!

413
00:28:01,097 --> 00:28:02,231
Hyung!

414
00:28:07,870 --> 00:28:09,271
Suk Jin hyung!

415
00:28:09,939 --> 00:28:11,240
Feel!

416
00:28:12,341 --> 00:28:13,275
Suk Jin hyung!

417
00:28:14,577 --> 00:28:17,146
Kwang Soo! Kwang Soo!

418
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:19,849
Save me! Save me!

419
00:28:19,882 --> 00:28:21,417
Kwang Soo, save me!

420
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:26,288
Noooo!

421
00:28:31,661 --> 00:28:35,297
I'll avenge you... This one who did this to my hyung.

422
00:28:35,364 --> 00:28:37,333
I'll definitely avenge you!

423
00:28:39,568 --> 00:28:42,238
Kwang Soo.

424
00:28:43,072 --> 00:28:44,340
Kwang Soo.

425
00:28:46,308 --> 00:28:48,044
Why are you running around for vengeance?

426
00:28:48,778 --> 00:28:50,012
You were had, weren't you?

427
00:28:50,046 --> 00:28:52,248
Hyung. What exactly are you, hyung?

428
00:28:52,281 --> 00:28:53,916
Did you get to be the spy?

429
00:28:53,949 --> 00:28:55,451
I'm not the spy, hyung!

430
00:28:55,484 --> 00:28:56,485
If you're not, what are you getting vengeance for?

431
00:28:56,519 --> 00:28:58,454
Suk Jin hyung was dragged off...

432
00:28:59,321 --> 00:29:01,090
Go quickly. With your arms up.

433
00:29:02,291 --> 00:29:03,492
Hyung, are you a soy?

434
00:29:03,559 --> 00:29:06,362
Come up here when you find it.

435
00:29:33,823 --> 00:29:36,225
It definitely feels like someone is following me.

436
00:29:36,292 --> 00:29:38,027
How mysterious!

437
00:29:41,597 --> 00:29:43,399
I think there will be something here!

438
00:29:45,701 --> 00:29:48,070
Who is it?Who is it?Who is it?

439
00:29:48,738 --> 00:29:50,873
You can't trick me!

440
00:29:51,807 --> 00:29:52,908
Hyung!

441
00:29:52,942 --> 00:29:56,245
-Hmm? -Hyung Suk Jin hyung was eliminated!

442
00:29:56,278 --> 00:29:57,947
Suk Jin hyung was dragged off, with his mouth covered.

443
00:29:58,013 --> 00:29:58,748
What did you say?

444
00:29:59,615 --> 00:30:00,616
Oh, you scared me!

445
00:30:00,649 --> 00:30:02,251
Hyung! Don't do stuff like this!

446
00:30:02,318 --> 00:30:04,220
What? He was eliminated?

447
00:30:04,286 --> 00:30:06,622
I was continuously with Jedong hyung. I was walking with Jedong hyung, but

448
00:30:06,655 --> 00:30:07,690
Jedong hyung was never surprised.

449
00:30:07,690 --> 00:30:10,159
-There must be something here! -You're saying that Jedong hyung was not surprised!?

450
00:30:11,727 --> 00:30:13,829
Hey, we need to find these things quickly! What's going on?

451
00:30:14,396 --> 00:30:17,099
-Jedong hyung looks like he's running around catching people. -What?!

452
00:30:17,133 --> 00:30:20,736
He doesn't look like he's searching for things. He looks like he's searching for people!

453
00:30:23,239 --> 00:30:25,107
-Who is that? -Shunsh!

454
00:30:25,775 --> 00:30:29,145
-The two of them... -The two of them look like their working together...

455
00:30:39,421 --> 00:30:41,690
Oh!

456
00:30:50,199 --> 00:30:53,502
Hyung! Hyung, Jedong hyung is weird.

457
00:30:55,771 --> 00:30:57,239
Why?

458
00:30:57,306 --> 00:30:58,874
-He seems like he's trying find people. -Him and Hyun hyung, the two of them are acting weirdly!

459
00:30:58,908 --> 00:31:00,976
Hyung! The two of them, they're coming here!

460
00:31:01,043 --> 00:31:03,279
-Hey, is this a game where we're supposed to rip off name tags? -I don't know!

461
00:31:03,345 --> 00:31:05,481
Before, Do Hyun hyung tried to tear off Jedong hyung's name tag.

462
00:31:06,215 --> 00:31:07,883
-Ah, everyone...! -Mr. Do Hyun.

463
00:31:08,517 --> 00:31:09,718
Ah, you...

464
00:31:10,886 --> 00:31:13,556
-Why is everyone so not lively? -Hyung!

465
00:31:13,556 --> 00:31:14,790
-The mission is... -Suk Jin hung was eliminated...

466
00:31:14,857 --> 00:31:16,725
-So I heard. -You knew?

467
00:31:16,759 --> 00:31:18,093
Oh, of course I knew.

468
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:18,861
-Then how are you so composed? -Why are you so composed?

469
00:31:19,528 --> 00:31:22,097
Why are you so relaxed for your first guest appearance?

470
00:31:22,164 --> 00:31:23,332
I'm not.

471
00:31:24,366 --> 00:31:25,568
Suk Jin hyung was eliminated!

472
00:31:25,568 --> 00:31:28,137
-Hey, for now, let's separate. -Suk Jin hyung was eliminated?

473
00:31:28,170 --> 00:31:29,572
It's not something to be that shocked about.

474
00:31:29,605 --> 00:31:31,073
Exactly...

475
00:31:36,745 --> 00:31:38,280
I can't trust anyone.

476
00:31:43,652 --> 00:31:44,486
704?

477
00:31:50,226 --> 00:31:52,094
What is 704 2 degree piano?

478
00:31:52,161 --> 00:31:53,662
Is it telling me to go to Room 704?

479
00:31:54,630 --> 00:31:55,331
Oh!

480
00:31:55,397 --> 00:31:57,399
You haven't left yet? Oh! Chao chao!

481
00:32:00,402 --> 00:32:01,770
-Where are you going? -Yes?

482
00:32:01,804 --> 00:32:03,105
You're going back up to Seoul with us, right?

483
00:32:03,172 --> 00:32:05,040
-Yes, later we'll.. -Relax somewhere!

484
00:32:06,041 --> 00:32:07,509
Take off the fur costume! It's hot!

485
00:32:29,531 --> 00:32:30,566
What?

486
00:32:39,441 --> 00:32:41,110
Ah, nothing, nothing.

487
00:32:41,977 --> 00:32:42,811
There's nothing.

488
00:32:44,079 --> 00:32:45,648
But it's room 704...

489
00:33:10,673 --> 00:33:12,574
I think there definitely will be something here!

490
00:33:12,975 --> 00:33:14,376
Huh?

491
00:33:15,044 --> 00:33:16,712
Definitely. I think there will be one definitely!

492
00:33:27,256 --> 00:33:28,357
Oh! See!

493
00:33:38,434 --> 00:33:39,935
See, didn't I say?

494
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:49,545
Wow. Daebak, daebak.

495
00:33:51,046 --> 00:33:54,883
As expected... As expected, I'm...!

496
00:34:17,206 --> 00:34:19,842
Hao Chao. Hao Chao!

497
00:34:26,015 --> 00:34:27,516
-Hao Chao! Hao Chao? -Hao Chao.

498
00:34:37,059 --> 00:34:39,762
Hao Chao. Hao Chao.

499
00:35:05,621 --> 00:35:07,156
What, what's going on?

500
00:35:13,796 --> 00:35:14,930
It's here?

501
00:35:49,398 --> 00:35:50,866
What?

502
00:35:50,899 --> 00:35:52,734
No, nothing. Just curious about what you're doing.

503
00:35:52,801 --> 00:35:54,403
-What? -Just wondering what you're doing.

504
00:35:54,436 --> 00:35:55,671
Why are you doing that?

505
00:35:56,405 --> 00:35:58,574
-Because I wanted to see you. -I'll tear off your name tag!

506
00:35:58,607 --> 00:36:00,309
Hmm? Go ahead.

507
00:36:01,543 --> 00:36:02,945
-What? -Go ahead.

508
00:36:02,978 --> 00:36:04,746
You want me to rip it off? I really will!

509
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:06,315
If I say it in dialect, go ahead!

510
00:36:06,381 --> 00:36:07,950
-What? -Go ahead.

511
00:36:09,485 --> 00:36:10,853
Oh, please.

512
00:36:12,421 --> 00:36:15,924
The hometown that I lived in

513
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:20,996
HaHa out! HaHa out!

514
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:28,504
You heard, right? The second I stared to sing.

515
00:36:28,570 --> 00:36:32,007
You heard them say 'OUT', right? I'm going easy on you because it's you.

516
00:36:36,445 --> 00:36:40,082
HaHa out! HaHa out!

517
00:36:43,118 --> 00:36:44,286
What?

518
00:36:48,223 --> 00:36:49,191
Hyung!

519
00:37:03,672 --> 00:37:05,107
Ah!

520
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:06,508
Hyung!

521
00:37:06,608 --> 00:37:08,143
Hyung!

522
00:37:09,178 --> 00:37:10,279
Hyung!

523
00:37:27,162 --> 00:37:30,699
Lee Kwang Soo out! Lee Kwang Soo out!

524
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:35,137
-Lee Kwang Soo out! Lee Kwang Soo out! -See!

525
00:37:36,004 --> 00:37:37,239
What is this?

526
00:38:06,868 --> 00:38:08,604
I don't know what's what at all.

527
00:38:16,044 --> 00:38:16,912
Oh!

528
00:38:18,347 --> 00:38:19,414
What is this?

529
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,688
What is this? See here.

530
00:38:30,626 --> 00:38:32,227
What does 2,3 mean?

531
00:38:32,327 --> 00:38:33,929
This is a symbol of Lupin.

532
00:38:34,896 --> 00:38:37,199
Lu... Ah, this is that today, I see.

533
00:38:37,899 --> 00:38:39,768
Lopin vs. Holmes!

534
00:38:39,801 --> 00:38:41,036
Right?

535
00:38:44,906 --> 00:38:46,842
This is a hint for the culprit.

536
00:38:47,709 --> 00:38:49,478
This one is my hint.

537
00:38:57,819 --> 00:38:58,887
What is this?

538
00:39:10,599 --> 00:39:12,267
The culprit is among us.

539
00:39:27,349 --> 00:39:31,820
As each of us gets eliminated, they're letting us know through these one by one.

540
00:39:43,932 --> 00:39:46,168
Why are they still walking around?

541
00:39:48,337 --> 00:39:52,207
Is this perhaps, from the Sherlock Holmes series... Baskers... Isn't there that dog?

542
00:39:57,913 --> 00:40:00,148
Considering that Chao Chao came today, isn't it that?

543
00:40:01,516 --> 00:40:05,253
Ah, it's been so long since I've watched the series, I can't remember.

544
00:40:28,176 --> 00:40:30,045
Where is everyone?

545
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:32,981
Where is everyone?

546
00:40:34,049 --> 00:40:36,084
Where is everybody?

547
00:40:37,452 --> 00:40:38,854
It's Yoon Do Hyun sunbasenim.

548
00:40:59,007 --> 00:41:02,911
Ah. What? Why are you locking the door?

549
00:41:02,944 --> 00:41:05,447
Ah! Sunbaenim! Why are you doing this to me?

550
00:41:05,514 --> 00:41:08,583
-No... -What did I ever do wrong?

551
00:41:09,217 --> 00:41:13,054
-Why are you doing this to me? -But it's not like I'm a monster. Why are you acting this way?

552
00:41:13,121 --> 00:41:16,291
Why are you doing this to me? What do you want?

553
00:41:17,659 --> 00:41:20,962
Just.. that... you've been on the show for a long time, so I had a few questions.

554
00:41:23,899 --> 00:41:25,300
You do think there is treasure?

555
00:41:26,034 --> 00:41:30,672
Sunbaenim. It's not that I think there's treasure. I think you're the culprit.

556
00:41:31,973 --> 00:41:34,743
-What? No. How could the guest be the culprit?

557
00:41:36,778 --> 00:41:40,549
-You're luring us one by one, telling us you'll show us your green cards so you can tear off our name tags, right?

558
00:41:41,383 --> 00:41:43,285
I wonder never play cowardly like that.

559
00:41:50,659 --> 00:41:52,394
Then relax and come out later when you're comfortable.

560
00:41:53,128 --> 00:41:54,963
Yes, sunbaenim. I'll see you later.

561
00:42:01,236 --> 00:42:03,038
Gary, Gary! There's something strange!

562
00:42:04,172 --> 00:42:05,040
-What is? -It's really strange!

563
00:42:10,412 --> 00:42:14,249
Oppa! See! Hasn't Yoon Do Hyun sunbaenim shown you an A4 sized sheet of paper and asked you if you were searching for the cards?

564
00:42:14,316 --> 00:42:16,218
I haven't spoken to him at all. I've been busy running away.

565
00:42:16,918 --> 00:42:19,054
How could you just run away? You should have been searching for stuff!

566
00:42:19,087 --> 00:42:23,458
-But there has to be cards! I was searching for cards! -Oppa, there's a chance there may be no cards left now!

567
00:42:24,559 --> 00:42:25,694
None left?

568
00:42:25,727 --> 00:42:27,596
I'm saying it may not be cards.

569
00:42:28,430 --> 00:42:32,701
But.. then why did he show us his cards earlier?

570
00:42:34,736 --> 00:42:38,640
This is not the time for us to be like this.

571
00:42:41,910 --> 00:42:42,511
What's this?

572
00:42:42,577 --> 00:42:43,812
Oh!

573
00:42:44,412 --> 00:42:45,547
It's T-ARA.

574
00:42:51,553 --> 00:42:56,057
Do these four have some link to Do Hyun hyung?

575
00:43:02,898 --> 00:43:07,269
"First" "Floor" "Store" "Room"

576
00:43:19,948 --> 00:43:20,849
Hyungnim!

577
00:43:20,882 --> 00:43:23,018
You came to sing, right? Why are you going to the piano?

578
00:43:24,219 --> 00:43:25,520
-No, no. -Huh? What's that?!

579
00:43:25,554 --> 00:43:27,022
It's a bell.

580
00:43:27,856 --> 00:43:29,691
-What is this? -What is that?

581
00:43:30,158 --> 00:43:32,527
Hyung! Don't ring that! These could be a strange consequence!

582
00:43:33,995 --> 00:43:35,430
Why would a bell that didn't exist before show up here?

583
00:43:35,463 --> 00:43:37,432
Kim Joog Kook! Is that why it's a bell?

584
00:43:42,003 --> 00:43:44,506
The hometown that I lived in

585
00:43:49,778 --> 00:43:51,546
...that I lived in

586
00:43:51,613 --> 00:43:54,916
-Why are you sitting down? -Don't tear off my name tag. -Hey, come here!

587
00:43:54,950 --> 00:43:58,053
-Hyung. Why have you sat in front of the piano? -There's no use.

588
00:43:58,086 --> 00:43:58,987
All of a sudden!

589
00:44:00,255 --> 00:44:01,389
Why have you sat down?

590
00:44:02,357 --> 00:44:04,159
Why have you sat down? Explain yourself quickly!

591
00:44:04,192 --> 00:44:06,962
-Quickly! You're acting so strangely right now. -What is going on right now?

592
00:44:06,995 --> 00:44:08,496
Why did you sit down there?

593
00:44:08,530 --> 00:44:10,432
Don't keep looking at people's backs.

594
00:44:10,498 --> 00:44:11,933
Hyung!

595
00:44:11,967 --> 00:44:15,737
What's wrong with you? Why do you keep coming behind me?

596
00:44:15,737 --> 00:44:19,341
Why is everyone like this? Everyone! Why is everyone like this?

597
00:44:19,374 --> 00:44:23,078
Who plays the piano with their back?

598
00:44:25,647 --> 00:44:26,948
Over there!

599
00:44:43,999 --> 00:44:46,434
What is it?! Why'd you put the mic here?

600
00:44:48,036 --> 00:44:49,437
-Gary! -Yes?

601
00:44:49,471 --> 00:44:50,739
Why did you go?

602
00:44:50,772 --> 00:44:52,607
Ah! It's so frustrating!

603
00:44:53,842 --> 00:44:55,110
-Oppa! -Hm?

604
00:44:55,176 --> 00:44:57,078
What's this Jingling noise?

605
00:45:00,715 --> 00:45:01,650
What?

606
00:45:13,328 --> 00:45:16,865
Ah, Mr. Do Hyun. What is your role here today? What is your role?

607
00:45:17,399 --> 00:45:18,400
An invited singer.

608
00:45:18,566 --> 00:45:20,268
What invited singer?

609
00:45:26,808 --> 00:45:29,444
Find the culprit.

610
00:45:31,179 --> 00:45:33,815
who is stealing your dream.

611
00:45:33,882 --> 00:45:37,419
Even more than you think,

612
00:45:37,485 --> 00:45:41,322
He is closer to you!

613
00:45:41,356 --> 00:45:44,726
He is closer to you!

614
00:46:44,319 --> 00:46:45,320
-Ni hao! -Ni hao!

615
00:46:47,889 --> 00:46:50,158
Doesn't it feel like their telling someone our location?

616
00:46:50,925 --> 00:46:52,160
What?What?

617
00:46:52,193 --> 00:46:53,561
What?

618
00:46:53,628 --> 00:46:55,897
Hey dongsaengs! Why did you come back again?

619
00:46:55,930 --> 00:46:57,332
Ni hao!

620
00:46:59,434 --> 00:47:01,035
No, why did you come back?

621
00:47:02,003 --> 00:47:03,805
If it's hot, take this off!

622
00:47:05,774 --> 00:47:07,308
Ice wa-ter!

623
00:47:09,077 --> 00:47:10,578
Ice wa-ter!

624
00:47:11,112 --> 00:47:12,413
Take it off. It's hot.

625
00:47:13,581 --> 00:47:15,316
It's hot. Take it off.

626
00:47:26,694 --> 00:47:30,064
Refreashing. Isn't it?

627
00:47:39,808 --> 00:47:41,242
Why do you keep showing me your watch. Wait.

628
00:47:42,377 --> 00:47:44,679
-Wait, wait! -...Expensive!

629
00:47:46,181 --> 00:47:47,382
Something's strange.

630
00:47:47,448 --> 00:47:48,683
I mean, why...

631
00:47:50,251 --> 00:47:51,152
What?

632
00:47:54,389 --> 00:47:56,558
They keep luring me...

633
00:47:57,425 --> 00:47:59,861
Someone always is eliminated when they're with those two.

634
00:48:04,199 --> 00:48:05,700
Why is he walking around with his watch off?

635
00:48:08,169 --> 00:48:08,937
Here.

636
00:48:13,208 --> 00:48:14,976
Hyung, this is the first time you've seen me wear a watch, right?

637
00:48:15,877 --> 00:48:18,246
-Hyung, have you even seen me wear a watch? In the neighbourhood? -That's true!

638
00:48:19,414 --> 00:48:20,815
Ni hao. Chao chao.

639
00:48:23,184 --> 00:48:24,819
Ni hao.

640
00:48:27,589 --> 00:48:29,357
Why did he show me his watch?

641
00:48:57,919 --> 00:49:00,688
See! Room 704! See!

642
00:49:08,930 --> 00:49:12,367
What? What? What? What?

643
00:49:16,471 --> 00:49:19,974
Kim Jedong. Yoo Jae Suk, out! Kim Jedong. Yoo Jae Suk, out!

644
00:49:22,777 --> 00:49:26,681
-Kim Jedong. Yoo Jae Suk, out! Kim Jedong. Yoo Jae Suk, out! -Huh? What's going on?!

645
00:49:28,716 --> 00:49:30,351
Jedong hyung was eliminated?

646
00:49:58,479 --> 00:49:59,747
What are you doing? Wait a minute! What are you doing?

647
00:50:01,716 --> 00:50:04,819
Gary out! Gary out!

648
00:50:50,064 --> 00:50:51,632
Come in quickly!

649
00:50:54,402 --> 00:50:55,970
I found a hint.

650
00:50:57,338 --> 00:51:01,009
474455668.

651
00:51:07,148 --> 00:51:10,184
Page 474?

652
00:51:12,420 --> 00:51:13,755
Ah, what is it?

653
00:51:16,691 --> 00:51:19,394
What could this be? 474455668.

654
00:51:19,427 --> 00:51:21,763
474455668.

655
00:51:21,796 --> 00:51:24,532
It was put together like this because there's something definitely in this book, right?

656
00:51:31,105 --> 00:51:33,908
I'm not sure how the hints are hidden.

657
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:40,648
I do think there will be something here...

658
00:51:50,658 --> 00:51:53,027
What, two?

659
00:51:53,094 --> 00:51:54,362
But.

660
00:51:56,931 --> 00:51:58,299
It's in somewhere like this?

661
00:51:59,167 --> 00:52:01,569
Ah, somewhere like this... These people are our staff, aren't they?

662
00:52:01,636 --> 00:52:03,071
They're a part of the staff.

663
00:52:04,906 --> 00:52:06,107
Where is this place?

664
00:52:06,974 --> 00:52:09,944
It kind of looks like an engine room?

665
00:52:13,181 --> 00:52:15,883
Ah, I was too focused on the outside decks.

666
00:52:18,486 --> 00:52:19,687
Hyung, what are you doing?

667
00:52:21,689 --> 00:52:22,957
What is that?

668
00:52:23,024 --> 00:52:24,092
-You found one? -Yeah.

669
00:52:24,125 --> 00:52:25,293
Let's see it.

670
00:52:26,394 --> 00:52:28,262
There are not many people still alive now.

671
00:52:28,296 --> 00:52:31,899
-See and you. -Yes.

672
00:52:31,966 --> 00:52:33,935
-But hyung... -What are you?

673
00:52:33,968 --> 00:52:35,803
-Eh? -What are you? You role.

674
00:52:35,837 --> 00:52:37,205
And what are you, hyung?

675
00:52:39,841 --> 00:52:43,211
Hyung! What is that? First show me. Everyone else has shown me, but you haven't, hyung.

676
00:52:45,279 --> 00:52:46,647
I will never show you!

677
00:52:46,681 --> 00:52:48,249
Why? Please show me...

678
00:52:49,050 --> 00:52:50,084
-Hyung! -I will never.

679
00:53:14,675 --> 00:53:15,910
What is up with that hyung?

680
00:53:17,645 --> 00:53:19,113
What is up with that hyung?

681
00:53:25,052 --> 00:53:26,521
-I will never. No. -Hyung, there seems to be no other answer.

682
00:53:26,587 --> 00:53:28,156
I will never show you.

683
00:53:29,157 --> 00:53:30,124
Hang on!

684
00:53:30,158 --> 00:53:33,494
Sorry. Hang on! If I show you. I fell like it will be game over.

685
00:53:33,528 --> 00:53:34,996
-Hyung! -Hey!

686
00:53:36,030 --> 00:53:36,898
It's you, isn't it?!

687
00:53:36,931 --> 00:53:39,233
-What am I? -He.. You! You're the culprit, the culprit!

688
00:53:40,868 --> 00:53:45,706
Even more than you think, he is closer to you!

689
00:53:46,741 --> 00:53:47,975
Why are you locking the door?

690
00:53:48,009 --> 00:53:50,978
Ah! Sunbaenim! Why are you doing this to me?

691
00:53:51,012 --> 00:53:52,980
We can't go around together like this.

692
00:53:53,047 --> 00:53:54,749
What, no. I just came here myself.

693
00:53:55,583 --> 00:53:57,251
Why have you sat down? Explain yourself quickly!

694
00:53:57,318 --> 00:53:58,386
Don't keep looking at people's backs!

695
00:53:58,386 --> 00:54:01,289
He.. You! You're the culprit, the culprit!

696
00:54:01,589 --> 00:54:03,257
-You're the culprit! -I'm not!

697
00:54:06,227 --> 00:54:07,228
-Hyung! -Hey, the culprit!

698
00:54:07,228 --> 00:54:07,328
Ahh! No! You're the culprit! Ahh!
-Hyung! -Hey, the culprit!

699
00:54:07,328 --> 00:54:08,963
Ahh! No! You're the culprit! Ahh!

700
00:54:17,205 --> 00:54:19,307
No!

701
00:54:37,525 --> 00:54:38,960
-What? -He's the culprit!

702
00:54:39,827 --> 00:54:41,462
I'm not...

703
00:54:42,330 --> 00:54:45,132
Yoon Do Hyun, out! Yoon Do Hyun, out!

704
00:54:47,468 --> 00:54:50,905
Yoon Do Hyun, out! Yoon Do Hyun, out!

705
00:54:52,039 --> 00:54:53,107
Ah, this is really...

706
00:55:10,558 --> 00:55:11,692
Hang on...

707
00:55:29,844 --> 00:55:30,745
Jong Kook oppa!

708
00:55:30,811 --> 00:55:33,080
Jong Kook oppa!

709
00:55:33,147 --> 00:55:34,649
Kim Jong Kook!

710
00:55:36,851 --> 00:55:38,653
-I found a hint! -What is it?

711
00:55:38,686 --> 00:55:42,256
Oppa! And I found a truly crucial hint.

712
00:55:42,256 --> 00:55:43,624
What is it?

713
00:55:44,325 --> 00:55:47,995
I was at the root before, but while I was coming down, on the side where the piano, this was at the bar.

714
00:55:53,067 --> 00:55:54,969
The Ricals of Sherlock Holmes.

715
00:55:55,002 --> 00:55:56,470
And...

716
00:55:59,507 --> 00:56:00,975
It was together like this.

717
00:56:01,008 --> 00:56:02,543
Then we have to decipher this.

718
00:56:02,576 --> 00:56:06,280
To me, this looks like page numbers, oppa.

719
00:56:07,114 --> 00:56:08,249
Try to add all these up.

720
00:56:08,282 --> 00:56:10,718
No, no. See, because it all falls perfectly.

721
00:56:10,785 --> 00:56:14,889
-It splits into 474 Then 488, then 558. -Does it?

722
00:56:14,955 --> 00:56:16,991
Then let's go to page 474.

723
00:56:17,024 --> 00:56:18,926
474.

724
00:56:27,468 --> 00:56:29,337
Page 466.

725
00:56:29,370 --> 00:56:32,473
There's a lot of numbers on this page. Do you think it has to do with numbers?

726
00:56:34,508 --> 00:56:36,077
1 minute before to 9:40.

727
00:56:36,110 --> 00:56:37,645
...Chocolate...

728
00:56:39,313 --> 00:56:41,148
-Page 558. -558.

729
00:56:44,785 --> 00:56:45,519
558.

730
00:56:54,195 --> 00:56:55,529
With this, there's just no answer.

731
00:56:55,596 --> 00:56:57,765
There really is no answer.

732
00:56:58,733 --> 00:57:02,803
-Oppa, let's try to clear our minds as much as possible and think simply.

733
00:57:04,038 --> 00:57:08,109
You're saying it's all within the book? Within the book? Within the book...

734
00:57:09,210 --> 00:57:10,378
Within the book...

735
00:57:12,213 --> 00:57:17,084
Ah, we got all the way here, but we can't solve this, so...

736
00:57:17,118 --> 00:57:18,619
Let's look at this.

737
00:57:23,124 --> 00:57:24,125
Hang on...

738
00:57:24,191 --> 00:57:25,826
Hang on...

739
00:57:25,893 --> 00:57:29,597
Hey! 474,466,558?

740
00:57:29,630 --> 00:57:31,265
Hang on, 474?

741
00:57:39,407 --> 00:57:40,274
What is this?

742
00:57:42,476 --> 00:57:44,044
The cuilprit is among us.

743
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:47,615
There definitely will be something.

744
00:57:48,682 --> 00:57:51,051
You just have to be wary of everyone. No mater what.

745
00:57:51,085 --> 00:57:52,686
Don't trust anyone.

746
00:57:57,792 --> 00:57:58,826
What is it, oppa?

747
00:57:59,593 --> 00:58:02,163
Suk!

748
00:58:03,230 --> 00:58:04,565
Oh?

749
00:58:05,199 --> 00:58:06,267
What is 2,3?

750
00:58:23,150 --> 00:58:24,218
-No, no. -Huh? What's this?

751
00:58:24,285 --> 00:58:26,220
A bell that didn't exist before no exists!

752
00:58:26,287 --> 00:58:28,322
What is that?!

753
00:58:36,397 --> 00:58:37,798
Crystal?

754
00:58:38,599 --> 00:58:42,303
In this world, the one and only"Yoo Soo Jesong".

755
00:58:42,369 --> 00:58:44,705
I love you forever.

756
00:58:48,576 --> 00:58:49,977
Jin!

757
00:58:52,112 --> 00:58:53,080
Suk Jin!

758
00:58:53,113 --> 00:58:54,782
Ji Suk Jin!

759
00:58:56,884 --> 00:58:57,885
Oppa, how'd you figure that out?

760
00:58:58,686 --> 00:58:59,887
How'd you figure that out?

761
00:59:28,883 --> 00:59:31,652
Oh, ah Meeting again like this...

762
00:59:31,719 --> 00:59:33,921
-Happy New Year. -Happy New Year.

763
00:59:51,872 --> 00:59:54,441
So, we thought hard and... Well, why don't you read this?

764
00:59:54,475 --> 00:59:55,843
OK

765
00:59:57,211 --> 01:00:01,815
You are the culprit. Without being caught by anyone, while using tricks, commit a perfect crime.

766
01:00:05,719 --> 01:00:07,688
You succeed if you eliminate all of the Running Man.

767
01:00:07,688 --> 01:00:10,824
-Because you said you wanted to become the protagonist. -Of course I do

768
01:00:11,926 --> 01:00:14,161
Well, we are brainstorming, but

769
01:00:14,194 --> 01:00:15,496
Yes, yes.

770
01:00:15,563 --> 01:00:19,466
yoo Mr. Ji Suk Jin, must fill in the details.

771
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:22,970
-You want me to fill in the details? -That's correct.

772
01:00:23,837 --> 01:00:25,773
I think that needs to be first.

773
01:00:26,507 --> 01:00:29,310
Just from the feeling. How at ease I would fee.

774
01:00:29,343 --> 01:00:31,545
Kwang Soo needs to stay a while...

775
01:00:32,346 --> 01:00:35,516
I'll tear off Kwang Soo's last. Easily. With a light heart.

776
01:00:42,189 --> 01:00:45,593
But the biggest problem is, if I'm alive till the end, they're get suspicious.

777
01:00:46,293 --> 01:00:47,528
Why don't we do this?

778
01:00:47,628 --> 01:00:50,965
I'll get eliminated first.

779
01:00:51,031 --> 01:00:53,434
-You will yourself? -Just like always!

780
01:00:53,467 --> 01:00:56,036
-Like always? -Yes, like always. Then they won't be suspicious.

781
01:00:56,070 --> 01:00:57,838
-Very first? -Yes.

782
01:00:57,905 --> 01:00:59,440
Suk Jin hyung!

783
01:00:59,473 --> 01:01:00,841
Oh?!

784
01:01:03,611 --> 01:01:07,047
The most important point is, when I get eliminated first, no one will be suspicious.

785
01:01:07,881 --> 01:01:09,049
-Suk Jin hyung was eliminated? -Yes.

786
01:01:09,116 --> 01:01:11,385
It's not something to be that shocked about.

787
01:01:11,418 --> 01:01:12,119
Exactly...

788
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:17,191
Guys, I will show you what a perfect crime is.

789
01:01:18,359 --> 01:01:19,426
I am the culprit!

790
01:01:19,493 --> 01:01:22,930
Ji Suk Jin!

791
01:01:35,175 --> 01:01:36,910
You have what you have to do, right? -Yes, I do.

792
01:01:38,178 --> 01:01:39,980
Please do your best.

793
01:01:40,714 --> 01:01:42,716
It'll be best if I get eliminated first, right?

794
01:01:44,518 --> 01:01:45,686
I'll get eliminated and...

795
01:02:08,075 --> 01:02:08,809
No one's coming, ahead.

796
01:02:12,846 --> 01:02:13,847
Jedong!

797
01:02:18,385 --> 01:02:19,486
Let's start. Cover my mouth, cover it.

798
01:02:29,630 --> 01:02:31,198
-Hyung, what do you have? -If you bring something...

799
01:02:31,231 --> 01:02:36,003
-Do you have something? -No matter what you find, you need to have what I have.

800
01:02:42,576 --> 01:02:43,610
Suk Jin hyung!

801
01:02:52,853 --> 01:02:54,455
-Hyung! -Kwang Soo!

802
01:03:01,395 --> 01:03:02,396
It's started.

803
01:03:08,802 --> 01:03:11,338
Where do we go? Do you know where to go?

804
01:03:12,439 --> 01:03:13,741
Do you know where to go?

805
01:03:23,117 --> 01:03:24,284
Let's go...

806
01:03:24,952 --> 01:03:26,587
The first is a success.

807
01:03:28,589 --> 01:03:30,090
-See -But.

808
01:03:30,124 --> 01:03:32,559
-Who is that? -Jedong hyung is acting weird.

809
01:03:32,593 --> 01:03:35,596
The two of them are strange! Both of them.

810
01:03:41,769 --> 01:03:43,537
What kind of detective are you, really?

811
01:03:43,604 --> 01:03:45,439
Oh, please.

812
01:03:45,506 --> 01:03:47,674
Hyung, don't laugh.

813
01:03:47,708 --> 01:03:50,577
Have you watched that anime, Metantel Conan?

814
01:03:51,378 --> 01:03:53,580
Of course I have.

815
01:03:53,614 --> 01:03:56,183
Why are you copying that?

816
01:03:57,918 --> 01:04:00,387
-And I hear Suk Jin hyung was eliminated? -Yes.

817
01:04:00,420 --> 01:04:01,855
Hyung!

818
01:04:02,823 --> 01:04:06,727
No matter what you gather, just know that if you don't have what I have, it's useless.

819
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:08,228
What?

820
01:04:08,262 --> 01:04:12,666
No matter what hint you find...

821
01:04:12,699 --> 01:04:16,236
No matter what hint you find, just know if you don't have what I have, it's useless.

822
01:04:17,104 --> 01:04:20,407
Don't confuse people with those strange speaches!

823
01:04:21,875 --> 01:04:23,577
-I'm not ourlous at all. -Really?

824
01:04:24,878 --> 01:04:26,180
You're just pretending.

825
01:04:27,481 --> 01:04:29,716
Do you know what Suk Jin hyung was wliminated though?

826
01:04:29,783 --> 01:04:31,385
Of course!

827
01:04:31,418 --> 01:04:32,853
Why was he eliminated?

828
01:04:32,886 --> 01:04:34,121
His name tag?

829
01:04:34,221 --> 01:04:38,759
You don't even know that? You are pltful.

830
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:41,495
-Ah, everyone... -Mr. Do Hyun!

831
01:04:41,528 --> 01:04:43,463
Ah, you...

832
01:04:44,164 --> 01:04:46,300
-Why is everyone so not lively? -Hyung.

833
01:04:46,333 --> 01:04:48,335
-The mission is... -Suk Jin hyung was eliminated...

834
01:04:48,368 --> 01:04:50,637
-Then how are you so composed? -Why are you so composed?

835
01:04:51,638 --> 01:04:52,906
I think I should rest.

836
01:04:52,940 --> 01:04:54,575
Why are you resting?

837
01:04:54,608 --> 01:04:57,611
What ... Did..What ... Did you do something?

838
01:04:57,644 --> 01:04:58,145
I've done everything.

839
01:04:59,246 --> 01:05:00,147
Hyung!

840
01:05:01,114 --> 01:05:02,049
Hyung!

841
01:05:04,184 --> 01:05:07,354
Ah, this is what I'm supposed to do! Act and get people confused...

842
01:05:08,322 --> 01:05:09,790
This is a battle of the brains, I see!

843
01:05:31,078 --> 01:05:32,112
Oh, you play piano well!

844
01:05:32,746 --> 01:05:35,349
I think that hyung has something. He keeps following me.

845
01:05:36,083 --> 01:05:37,618
Please continues to play, why are you leaving?

846
01:05:38,418 --> 01:05:39,419
Hyung.

847
01:05:39,486 --> 01:05:41,622
What are you doing?

848
01:05:43,223 --> 01:05:45,192
If you play like that, how will I look?

849
01:05:46,226 --> 01:05:48,395
If you play like that, how will I look?

850
01:06:00,641 --> 01:06:01,875
What, what's going on?

851
01:06:02,809 --> 01:06:03,977
Chao chao.

852
01:06:04,011 --> 01:06:05,479
It's here? It's here?

853
01:06:36,276 --> 01:06:37,511
Hey, come here.

854
01:06:38,645 --> 01:06:39,780
Come in for a second.

855
01:06:39,846 --> 01:06:41,214
Hyung, what's going on?

856
01:06:41,281 --> 01:06:42,716
It's the all.

857
01:06:43,784 --> 01:06:46,153
-What! Hyung! -Stay still.

858
01:06:56,830 --> 01:06:57,798
This is my scenarlo.

859
01:06:58,932 --> 01:07:00,100
Sure, speak.

860
01:07:00,133 --> 01:07:02,336
Hyung, this was a self-fabricated scenarlo?!

861
01:07:03,036 --> 01:07:05,205
Hyung! Your day had come this quickly?

862
01:07:06,840 --> 01:07:08,041
Who's that?

863
01:07:17,617 --> 01:07:18,652
Hyung!

864
01:07:19,252 --> 01:07:20,887
-Catch him. catch him. -Hyung!

865
01:07:20,921 --> 01:07:22,823
Hey! We need to catch him!

866
01:07:36,370 --> 01:07:39,406
The hometown I lived in

867
01:07:39,439 --> 01:07:41,875
HaHa out! HaHa out!

868
01:07:43,944 --> 01:07:46,980
You heard, right? The second I stared to sing.

869
01:07:47,047 --> 01:07:51,485
You heard them say 'OUT', right? I'm going easy on you because it's you.

870
01:08:02,596 --> 01:08:03,530
Wait, wait.

871
01:08:03,563 --> 01:08:05,866
-Wait, wait! -...Expensive!

872
01:08:19,546 --> 01:08:20,447
...Gold watch. Expensive.

873
01:08:32,059 --> 01:08:33,527
See! Room 704!

874
01:08:50,310 --> 01:08:51,078
What?

875
01:08:58,552 --> 01:09:01,688
Oh, Jedong was here, too? Jedong was here?

876
01:09:02,289 --> 01:09:03,657
-What is this?! -I didn't see you, Jedong.

877
01:09:03,723 --> 01:09:05,125
Hang on!

878
01:09:09,796 --> 01:09:11,064
What's going on?

879
01:09:11,098 --> 01:09:14,000
You are Sherlock Holmes. I am Lupin.

880
01:09:14,868 --> 01:09:18,138
-It's all my soenarlo. -Room 704...

881
01:09:19,106 --> 01:09:20,807
Search for Gary.

882
01:09:20,874 --> 01:09:22,609
Search for Gary.

883
01:09:36,857 --> 01:09:38,191
Gary, what are you doing? Let's see...

884
01:09:38,992 --> 01:09:40,460
-Let's see. -Hyung, why'd you come in so suddenly?

885
01:09:41,661 --> 01:09:43,363
Wow! Hang on!

886
01:09:43,396 --> 01:09:44,965
Why are you like this? What are you doing?

887
01:09:44,998 --> 01:09:46,666
I'm eliminating you.

888
01:09:47,734 --> 01:09:51,938
This is my scenarlo. You are Sherlock Holmes. I am Lupin.

889
01:09:52,839 --> 01:09:54,641
I don't know anything about these.

890
01:10:11,057 --> 01:10:12,459
Killing two birds with one stone.

891
01:10:12,492 --> 01:10:14,194
Parents and grandparents still living.

892
01:10:15,595 --> 01:10:17,330
A total wreck?

893
01:10:18,064 --> 01:10:19,533
Through hell and high water.

894
01:10:21,568 --> 01:10:22,936
Hang on!

895
01:10:23,537 --> 01:10:26,540
First floor storeroom!

896
01:10:28,742 --> 01:10:29,843
I think that's right.

897
01:10:31,077 --> 01:10:33,280
I should get to the first floor.

898
01:10:35,482 --> 01:10:36,650
Hyung, what are you doing?

899
01:10:38,818 --> 01:10:40,620
Hang on!

900
01:10:40,620 --> 01:10:42,656
NO!

901
01:10:46,426 --> 01:10:48,128
-What? -He's the culprit?

902
01:10:48,728 --> 01:10:49,729
I'm not...

903
01:10:49,796 --> 01:10:51,498
Am I out?

904
01:10:52,232 --> 01:10:53,900
Hyung, the what is that?

905
01:10:54,501 --> 01:10:56,069
Why did you tear my name tag off then?

906
01:10:56,670 --> 01:11:00,006
-Bucause, hyung, before you...! But hyung! -We could have used this and found the treasure together!

907
01:11:00,640 --> 01:11:01,875
-What? -Hyung, before, you...

908
01:11:02,442 --> 01:11:05,946
Why did he rip my name tag off?

909
01:11:23,597 --> 01:11:24,831
-Hyung, have you arrived? -Mr. Do Hyun!

910
01:11:24,864 --> 01:11:27,634
Ah, hyung!

911
01:11:27,667 --> 01:11:29,336
What are we doing?

912
01:11:29,369 --> 01:11:30,971
What are you doing?

913
01:11:31,004 --> 01:11:33,206
Joog Kook ripped my name tag off!

914
01:11:33,273 --> 01:11:34,975
What?

915
01:11:35,008 --> 01:11:37,110
Joog Kook ripped my name tag off!

916
01:11:37,177 --> 01:11:39,246
Why did Joog Kook rip it off?

917
01:11:39,879 --> 01:11:43,316
He ripped it off and said to me, 'Hyung, you're not the spy?'

918
01:11:43,383 --> 01:11:47,554
Then... Then... Mr.Do Hyun, you don't know who the culprit is?

919
01:11:49,356 --> 01:11:50,557
I don't know!

920
01:11:50,590 --> 01:11:52,425
-Don't tell him. -Don't tell him. Don't tell him.

921
01:11:52,492 --> 01:11:54,995
Mr. Do Hyun will find out what he watches this on TV.

922
01:11:55,028 --> 01:11:56,796
You will be very surprised when you see the broadcast.

923
01:11:57,797 --> 01:12:00,000
You will find it very funny when you watch the broadcast.

924
01:12:00,033 --> 01:12:03,503
While he's eating he'll be watching the broadcast and go "Waht the hell!" and overturn the dinner table.

925
01:12:05,572 --> 01:12:07,574
Hyung, you worked really hard today.

926
01:12:09,142 --> 01:12:10,477
What id going on here?

927
01:12:10,510 --> 01:12:12,846
-You don't know who the culprit is? -I don't.

928
01:12:14,381 --> 01:12:17,017
I was going to show that to Jong Kook and search for it together.

929
01:12:17,050 --> 01:12:19,953
You don't know, huh. Though it's in here.

930
01:12:20,020 --> 01:12:23,323
-What does that mean? -I totally know it..

931
01:12:23,356 --> 01:12:27,794
-Tis is the hint. -It's over for us anyway. For all of us, it's over.

932
01:12:28,528 --> 01:12:31,097
He doesn't know at all.

933
01:12:31,865 --> 01:12:33,967
Hyung, how do you decipher that?

934
01:12:35,535 --> 01:12:37,570
-Right? -How do you decipher that?

935
01:12:38,204 --> 01:12:39,773
This is "first floor storeroom".

936
01:12:40,807 --> 01:12:42,309
-First floor storeroom. -First floor storeroom.

937
01:12:43,376 --> 01:12:44,811
I said that before!!

938
01:12:44,878 --> 01:12:48,782
When I found this, I said, it looks like there's a word in here... "First floor storeroom".

939
01:12:48,815 --> 01:12:51,618
-That's right. -I really did think it was "First floor storeroom".

940
01:12:52,319 --> 01:12:55,121
-I was thinking is it a storeroom on the first floor? -Why didn't you do that, hyung?

941
01:12:55,188 --> 01:12:59,726
-Hyung, hyung! Do you think you were caught and brought here? -You were right with the "First floor storeroom".

942
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:02,696
-What? -Are you thinking you are here because you're caught?

943
01:13:03,630 --> 01:13:05,398
The culprit was precisely.

944
01:13:05,465 --> 01:13:07,867
you, Mr. Yoon Do Hyun!

945
01:13:11,237 --> 01:13:14,507
-Candid camera! Candid camera! -You really didn't know?

946
01:13:15,742 --> 01:13:17,610
We were all eliminated because of you,Mr. Do Hyun.

947
01:13:17,644 --> 01:13:19,813
-Everyone, come out! -You still haven't figured it out?

948
01:13:20,613 --> 01:13:21,748
-Jong Kook hyung! -I mean, really...

949
01:13:21,815 --> 01:13:24,617
Joog Kook ripped your name tag off, right?

950
01:13:24,684 --> 01:13:27,654
-Right? -Yes.

951
01:13:29,889 --> 01:13:31,591
What? What are you talking about?

952
01:13:31,658 --> 01:13:34,394
Hyung, you won. You can leave and go home!

953
01:13:35,895 --> 01:13:38,264
You're trying to get rid of me and have a fun filming, aren't you?

954
01:13:42,602 --> 01:13:44,971
-Because you won. -Hyung.

955
01:13:45,605 --> 01:13:46,906
-This is the first floor storeroom. -Here?

956
01:13:46,973 --> 01:13:49,943
Yeah. If you find your way here, you've completed the mission.

957
01:13:49,943 --> 01:13:53,980
-Only the one person remaining loses. -That's right.

958
01:13:55,048 --> 01:13:56,883
This is the first floor storeroom, look around!

959
01:13:56,916 --> 01:13:59,018
-This is the first floor storeroom. -Hyung.

960
01:13:59,052 --> 01:14:01,187
What are you doing, Gary?!

961
01:14:01,221 --> 01:14:03,823
So you're saying that this place, where we are right now, is the first floor storeroom?

962
01:14:03,857 --> 01:14:05,558
No, it's the 6th floor. The 6th floor!

963
01:14:07,494 --> 01:14:09,729
Which side am I supposed to be a part of?

964
01:14:10,463 --> 01:14:13,666
-What, exactly what is this? -Don't look at me like that!

965
01:14:13,733 --> 01:14:18,204
-Ah, Golden Bell! -Wait! You said Suk Jin was eliminated.

966
01:14:19,239 --> 01:14:20,807
Then why isn't he here?

967
01:14:24,477 --> 01:14:29,349
Mr. Do Hyun, you're probably going to call us while watching TV going."Hey! All of you, come here!"

968
01:14:32,318 --> 01:14:36,156
"Hey! You! How could you make someone look like that?!"

969
01:14:44,597 --> 01:14:47,167
-Wow, this is deabak. -Oppa! Where are the words?

970
01:14:47,200 --> 01:14:50,770
-You still haven't found it? -Yeah, where is it? where is it?

971
01:14:50,804 --> 01:14:53,239
-You still haven't found it? -Ah, oh! Suk!

972
01:14:53,506 --> 01:14:54,507
Suk!

973
01:14:55,408 --> 01:14:57,043
I didn't see it because you had folded it down!

974
01:14:57,076 --> 01:15:00,747
And while I was reading, I kept thinking, the sentences are continuations, so why'd they pick these pages?

975
01:15:03,783 --> 01:15:06,085
Instead of page where sentences start anew.

976
01:15:06,119 --> 01:15:08,521
...but it's a already been revealed, "JI".

977
01:15:08,555 --> 01:15:10,790
It's just three words.

978
01:15:11,491 --> 01:15:14,127
When I saw "JI" and "Suk", I...

979
01:15:18,031 --> 01:15:21,267
-"Jin". -"Jin".

980
01:15:22,001 --> 01:15:24,437
Then what's going on? Ji Suk Jin was eliminated before!

981
01:15:25,171 --> 01:15:27,841
He was only pretending to be eliminated!

982
01:15:28,675 --> 01:15:32,645
And he had kept saying he was being mistreated..

983
01:15:39,819 --> 01:15:41,287
Tension, tension.

984
01:15:46,893 --> 01:15:47,927
How is it over there?

985
01:15:49,929 --> 01:15:51,631
They're there? They're there?

986
01:15:57,070 --> 01:15:57,937
What about over there? It is safe? OK.

987
01:16:02,375 --> 01:16:06,946
Escaping from him is escaping from him, but let's find the treasure first and lure him.

988
01:16:06,946 --> 01:16:08,982
Then let's find the treasure first. First, the hints are...

989
01:16:09,048 --> 01:16:11,618
See, we're here, but it could be outside...

990
01:16:11,651 --> 01:16:14,654
-Do Wan was there and... -That's the engine room, isn't it?

991
01:16:14,687 --> 01:16:16,222
It's the engine room.

992
01:16:17,323 --> 01:16:21,227
Usually, machines, engines like these are in the basement, near the bottom.

993
01:16:21,294 --> 01:16:23,263
And the celling is low, see?

994
01:16:23,329 --> 01:16:25,498
First, let's go in that direction. Come.

995
01:16:25,532 --> 01:16:28,001
Let's first try to find the engine room.

996
01:16:28,535 --> 01:16:30,803
Keep me alive!

997
01:16:30,870 --> 01:16:32,772
We have to stick together!

998
01:16:32,839 --> 01:16:35,074
Keep a good lookout, front and back.

999
01:16:35,608 --> 01:16:37,076
Today, I ,really...

1000
01:16:37,143 --> 01:16:39,646
Oppa, we won't betray each other today, right?

1001
01:16:39,679 --> 01:16:41,614
I'll use my whole strength today.

1002
01:16:43,249 --> 01:16:47,053
They'll come together from the place they were hidden.

1003
01:16:49,289 --> 01:16:54,060
The best method will be for me to hide here and...

1004
01:16:54,368 --> 01:16:55,808
I'll tear here off.

1005
01:16:55,800 --> 01:17:01,400
and the two of you will hold onto Joog Kook.

1006
01:17:02,969 --> 01:17:04,404
Oppa, engine room!

1007
01:17:04,437 --> 01:17:06,839
-Yeah, come down, It's down there. -Sorry.

1008
01:17:11,744 --> 01:17:14,180
Come! Ji Suk Jin is here!

1009
01:17:15,448 --> 01:17:16,482
Where?

1010
01:17:22,989 --> 01:17:24,023
What? What?

1011
01:17:29,152 --> 01:17:30,263
What!

1012
01:17:43,876 --> 01:17:45,152
Come! Ji Suk Jin is here!

1013
01:17:47,040 --> 01:17:48,180
Where?

1014
01:17:54,887 --> 01:17:56,736
What? What?

1015
01:18:01,056 --> 01:18:01,960
What!

1016
01:18:08,304 --> 01:18:09,216
No!

1017
01:18:12,538 --> 01:18:14,941
Wait! Hyung! Let's talk! And let me go!

1018
01:18:14,941 --> 01:18:17,076
Wait, wait.

1019
01:18:17,110 --> 01:18:18,978
Wait.

1020
01:18:19,078 --> 01:18:20,780
Let's talk!

1021
01:18:21,214 --> 01:18:22,415
Hyung!

1022
01:18:22,482 --> 01:18:24,117
It was perfect, wasn't it?

1023
01:18:24,183 --> 01:18:26,052
-No, we figured it out. -We figured it out.

1024
01:18:28,087 --> 01:18:29,856
-We figured out the pages. -What?

1025
01:18:29,922 --> 01:18:31,824
-We figured out the pages. -You figured out the book's pages?

1026
01:18:31,858 --> 01:18:33,726
Yeah.

1027
01:18:34,994 --> 01:18:37,530
But can the guards tear of my name tag as well?

1028
01:18:37,563 --> 01:18:39,065
They can't

1029
01:18:39,132 --> 01:18:41,000
-Oppa, right now... -Oh, the guards can't?

1030
01:18:41,067 --> 01:18:44,037
They're just not letting you come close.

1031
01:18:44,771 --> 01:18:46,906
Then those two can't tear off my name tag, right?

1032
01:18:47,907 --> 01:18:49,375
They can't tear off my name tag, right?

1033
01:18:49,442 --> 01:18:51,277
-Hey. -Right?

1034
01:18:51,911 --> 01:18:53,713
-First... -Oppa!

1035
01:18:55,848 --> 01:18:58,651
-First... They can't tear off my name tag... -Oppa! Oppa!

1036
01:19:06,392 --> 01:19:07,360
One of you come here!

1037
01:19:07,427 --> 01:19:10,196
-One of you, come here! -Oppa, quickly! I've grabbed hold on their legs!

1038
01:19:12,765 --> 01:19:13,866
You don't understand!

1039
01:19:13,900 --> 01:19:16,402
One of you, come here! One of you, come here!

1040
01:19:17,103 --> 01:19:19,439
- I've grabbed hold on their legs! -What don't I understand?

1041
01:19:37,290 --> 01:19:39,025
-One of you, come here! -What don't I understand?

1042
01:19:40,460 --> 01:19:41,794
Yes!

1043
01:19:44,464 --> 01:19:45,932
Yes!

1044
01:19:47,800 --> 01:19:50,703
-We caught? -This hyung is really...!

1045
01:19:51,938 --> 01:19:54,474
How could you trick us about being the culprit like that?

1046
01:19:54,540 --> 01:19:58,377
-This hyung is really...! -I really elaborately crafted this plan!

1047
01:20:11,390 --> 01:20:12,458
What is this?

1048
01:20:12,525 --> 01:20:14,494
I shall give this to you.

1049
01:20:16,162 --> 01:20:19,298
Hyung, you really are ... dasbak.

1050
01:20:19,932 --> 01:20:21,567
Hyung, you are daebak.

1051
01:20:23,703 --> 01:20:24,771
-Wow -Wow

1052
01:20:24,837 --> 01:20:27,507
-Wow. -That's not small fry.

1053
01:20:27,573 --> 01:20:29,242
Wow

1054
01:20:30,977 --> 01:20:32,111
-Oppa! We did it! -Yes! We did it!

1055
01:20:32,145 --> 01:20:34,447
- We did it! - It's been such a long time!

1056
01:20:41,187 --> 01:20:42,722
You will see when you watch the show, but it was a perfect scenario.

1057
01:20:42,755 --> 01:20:45,324
Ah, but at the end... Eh!

1058
01:20:46,125 --> 01:20:48,127
No one actually heard the broadcast that he was eliminated.

1059
01:20:48,161 --> 01:20:50,296
-That's right. -We only heard through rumour.

1060
01:20:50,396 --> 01:20:52,465
-That's what I said. -I showed my elimination to two people.

1061
01:20:57,003 --> 01:20:58,037
Ah, you really spread that rumour.

1062
01:21:02,842 --> 01:21:04,110
-What is that? -How nice! It looks cool!

1063
01:21:06,112 --> 01:21:08,614
-You can use those name tags going forward. -Really?
