1
00:00:06,457 --> 00:00:08,659
The winner is Gary!

2
00:00:09,427 --> 00:00:10,294
A trip to Europe.

3
00:00:17,401 --> 00:00:18,302
What do you know?

4
00:00:18,336 --> 00:00:19,370
Gary knows it.

5
00:00:28,179 --> 00:00:30,147
-No. -It seems empty.

6
00:00:31,082 --> 00:00:32,550
We're missing one person.

7
00:00:32,883 --> 00:00:35,753
Excuse me, you were very satisfied with last week's program weren't you?

8
00:00:36,354 --> 00:00:39,991
Suk Jin Hyung kept smiling so wide that it reveals his teeth this morning.

9
00:00:41,258 --> 00:00:43,661
Did you see his expression when he was tearing the name tags?

10
00:00:43,694 --> 00:00:46,831
He's like someone furious.

11
00:00:46,964 --> 00:00:47,565
He furiously tore off the name tags!

12
00:00:47,598 --> 00:00:50,001
That feeling is no joke!

13
00:00:50,034 --> 00:00:52,603
I think you will replay it over ten times.

14
00:00:53,938 --> 00:00:58,776
Look at Jong Kook and Ji Hyo's name tags, they got the special detective name tags.

15
00:01:01,412 --> 00:01:03,481
-Today is the day that Gary returns right? -Where's Gary?

16
00:01:03,547 --> 00:01:04,281
Yes.

17
00:01:04,315 --> 00:01:08,619
Later, Gary will be coming out from that direction.

18
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:10,688
Gary will surely bring something.

19
00:01:10,721 --> 00:01:15,559
-These are the postcards that Gary sent back from Europe. -Postcards?

20
00:01:17,762 --> 00:01:21,432
Hyung-nim, the place is filled with peace and solitude.

21
00:01:21,465 --> 00:01:24,368
Jea Suk hyung-nim, this place is filled with peace and solitude.

22
00:01:24,402 --> 00:01:27,438
Sometimes, it gets busy. I'm experiencing many emotions.

23
00:01:38,416 --> 00:01:43,354
Hello! I'm a Europer! Europer!

24
00:01:43,421 --> 00:01:48,225
I'm so excited to go to Europe that my nose turned red. Ah, seriously.

25
00:02:13,684 --> 00:02:17,421
After taking a nap.

26
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:23,127
You won't say "The power to control the space" and I'm back to Korea, right?

27
00:02:23,127 --> 00:02:26,163
It's not a joke right?

28
00:02:41,545 --> 00:02:46,250
Finally, my freedom in Europe, begins now.

29
00:02:47,318 --> 00:02:51,689
This person here, taking up the role of a tour guide today, Germany's tourism personnel.

30
00:02:51,755 --> 00:02:52,556
Soren.

31
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:55,392
-How old are you? -I'm 45.

32
00:02:56,894 --> 00:02:59,130
Hyung!

33
00:03:05,603 --> 00:03:10,307
-Frank sausage? -This is Frankfurt's typical sausage.

34
00:03:11,675 --> 00:03:15,513
Wow!The pig trotters is so tender!

35
00:03:22,353 --> 00:03:27,191
This is about Romerberg's history. It's the heart of the Frankfurt city.

36
00:03:28,292 --> 00:03:32,830
It has medieval architecture which attracts tourists with its unique scenery.

37
00:03:32,863 --> 00:03:34,698
-Hello. -Running Man!

38
00:03:34,765 --> 00:03:38,302
-Yes. How do you know? Where are you from? -I'm from China.

39
00:03:38,369 --> 00:03:42,640
China? Glad to meet you. 1,2,3 dim sum.

40
00:03:44,675 --> 00:03:48,479
-Wow! Thank you! Thank you! -Yeah, you're welcome.

41
00:03:48,546 --> 00:03:52,816
This is a proud moment of being a Running Man.

42
00:04:00,925 --> 00:04:02,293
Oh! Crow!

43
00:04:02,326 --> 00:04:02,993
There, there.

44
00:04:04,328 --> 00:04:07,064
Something good is going to happen today.

45
00:04:07,131 --> 00:04:09,767
The crow flies, Kang Gary is here.

46
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:12,303
ObiGaerak.

47
00:04:12,369 --> 00:04:14,972
Even the trees are beautiful.

48
00:04:25,349 --> 00:04:29,386
What a busy schedule. Myeok PDnim.

49
00:04:29,453 --> 00:04:33,123
Seriously, what a lightning speed holiday.

50
00:04:39,129 --> 00:04:43,434
After arriving at Frankfurt only 24 hours ago, I have arrived at London.

51
00:04:58,449 --> 00:05:02,586
If Germany has Frank sausages, England has Fish and Chips.

52
00:05:05,956 --> 00:05:09,593
Because I only can see it once, I have to look around quickly.

53
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:10,394
Nice.

54
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:17,601
It says that if there is someone crossing the street here, vehicles would stop automatically.

55
00:05:17,635 --> 00:05:20,638
It is a famous place in London.

56
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:37,621
The car did not stop!

57
00:05:37,655 --> 00:05:40,591
I must catch the right timing and cross quickly.

58
00:06:03,847 --> 00:06:06,483
What am I supposed to do here?!

59
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:09,320
I'm Gary!

60
00:06:24,401 --> 00:06:27,037
Clown Kang Gary.

61
00:06:30,341 --> 00:06:32,076
Good job.

62
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:34,545
Don't use the tone like as if you are training a dog!

63
00:06:39,683 --> 00:06:42,853
Geraid?

64
00:06:43,787 --> 00:06:46,457
Can't you let me enjoy a proper holiday?

65
00:06:50,194 --> 00:06:52,863
Wow! So cool!

66
00:06:54,131 --> 00:06:59,069
Running Man that is going global.

67
00:06:59,136 --> 00:07:02,272
In front of the bridge, I will build a new Running Man history.

68
00:07:14,151 --> 00:07:17,554
Are you okay?

69
00:07:17,588 --> 00:07:21,325
One person coughing, the other person has nightmares.

70
00:07:21,392 --> 00:07:24,928
What are you going to do about this?

71
00:07:24,995 --> 00:07:25,529
But I'm totally fine?

72
00:07:28,532 --> 00:07:31,068
I feel like my soul has already flown away.

73
00:07:34,104 --> 00:07:38,776
Wow Eiffel Tower!

74
00:07:38,809 --> 00:07:43,213
Because of the fog at night, I can't see the top!

75
00:07:43,313 --> 00:07:46,784
I'm only able to see only it once but there is the fog.

76
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:52,055
Wow!

77
00:07:55,359 --> 00:07:58,495
Okay 1,2,3!

78
00:08:00,831 --> 00:08:05,369
Everybody, take a look at the Eiffel Tower!

79
00:08:05,436 --> 00:08:08,172
What is this? This is only Kang Gary!

80
00:08:12,142 --> 00:08:15,312
What is this! Look at my face. This looks like a Christmas tree.

81
00:08:16,313 --> 00:08:19,082
An Eiffel Tower without a tower tip.

82
00:08:23,887 --> 00:08:27,724
It looks like a beautiful moment, but I have no idea what are they talking about.

83
00:08:27,791 --> 00:08:30,294
Let's break up.

84
00:08:30,394 --> 00:08:33,964
Let's break up.

85
00:08:34,064 --> 00:08:37,234
That's right, I've think about it and it is a good day for breaking up.

86
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:40,337
The first time we met was at the Eiffel Tower, right?

87
00:08:40,404 --> 00:08:44,541
Let's break up here. We had good time.

88
00:08:47,044 --> 00:08:49,379
Why is there nobody?

89
00:08:59,223 --> 00:09:02,726
I'm not allowed to move so I'm feeling nervous.

90
00:09:02,793 --> 00:09:06,330
Oh! Similar! Oh! Similar!

91
00:09:06,363 --> 00:09:09,466
Oh, it's here. In the postcard. Wow

92
00:09:22,679 --> 00:09:27,150
This are the postcards Gary sent from Europe.

93
00:09:27,217 --> 00:09:32,122
-Wow. -Isn't this the Louvre Museum in Paris?

94
00:09:34,224 --> 00:09:38,161
To Jae Suk a.k.a Yoo hyuk hyungnim. This place is filled with peace and solitude.

95
00:09:38,228 --> 00:09:40,797
Sometimes, it gets busy. I'm experiencing many emotions...

96
00:09:40,864 --> 00:09:43,500
-What are you doing? -That's how Gary would write this.

97
00:09:43,534 --> 00:09:46,770
-But I haven't seen any Europeans wearing green. -Green!

98
00:09:46,837 --> 00:09:49,406
-Why are you all green? -Even the shoes are green!

99
00:09:49,506 --> 00:09:53,076
That's really too much! You might as well change your cap to green.

100
00:09:54,811 --> 00:09:56,947
You're driving me crazy!

101
00:09:57,014 --> 00:10:00,117
And there is no sight of Europeans wearing green.

102
00:10:00,183 --> 00:10:03,186
-"So now..." Hmm? -It's an English acronym.

103
00:10:03,253 --> 00:10:05,255
-This, this. -"Lollol".

104
00:10:05,289 --> 00:10:09,293
"In 2012, I'll have even more 'fighting' moments."

105
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:12,195
"Nurture me so I can get the Deasang."

106
00:10:14,698 --> 00:10:16,466
Me? Nurturing? It's so funny.

107
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,101
"I love you! Kang Gary"

108
00:10:18,135 --> 00:10:20,237
"The Monday Couple." It's for Ji Hyo.

109
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:24,241
"The Seine River. The Seine River glitters like your eyes."

110
00:10:24,308 --> 00:10:26,610
Let's have a look, let's look at the Seine River.

111
00:10:26,677 --> 00:10:29,980
-Ji Hyo, Let's have a look at the Seine River. -No, oppa.

112
00:10:32,015 --> 00:10:35,752
"The Eiffel Tower's very high, just like how I can't reach your heart."

113
00:10:35,786 --> 00:10:39,323
"That's why my heart has been stolen away a blue-eyed ladies. Lollol."

114
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:41,358
It's becoming shorter, ah?

115
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:44,127
"Let's have even more 'fighting' moments in 2012."

116
00:10:44,161 --> 00:10:47,230
"From a cafe in Montmartre, Monday Couple's Kang Gary"

117
00:10:47,264 --> 00:10:49,066
"Monday Couple", oh my god.

118
00:10:49,132 --> 00:10:52,135
-Hey, it's becoming shorter now. -It's so obvious.

119
00:10:52,169 --> 00:10:56,073
-This, this is shorter, this one. Look. -Right.

120
00:10:56,106 --> 00:10:58,508
Right? These are so shorter.

121
00:10:58,508 --> 00:11:00,243
This is a result of being tried while writing.

122
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:01,044
"Ha Dong Hoon."

123
00:11:01,111 --> 00:11:04,815
"This place is so beautiful, it's seriously driving me crazy."

124
00:11:05,616 --> 00:11:06,683
"Hey! I love you."

125
00:11:06,717 --> 00:11:09,486
Hey, if this is how you do it, I'm tearing it up!

126
00:11:15,325 --> 00:11:17,461
An autograph.

127
00:11:17,494 --> 00:11:20,397
-Jeez, what's this? -An autograph.

128
00:11:20,464 --> 00:11:22,666
An autograph.

129
00:11:22,733 --> 00:11:26,003
-No, this is really too much. -"Be happy."

130
00:11:26,069 --> 00:11:27,604
He told you to be happy.

131
00:11:27,671 --> 00:11:32,476
-Be happy, he wants you to be happy. Gary wants you to be happy.

132
00:11:33,877 --> 00:11:36,480
-This is too much. -Kwang Soo, be happy.

133
00:11:36,546 --> 00:11:40,717
-I'm not touched. -No, didn't he tell you to be happy? Be happy.

134
00:11:40,784 --> 00:11:44,287
Though it's like this now, when we look at this ten years later we'll be extremely touched.

135
00:11:44,354 --> 00:11:46,089
Of course. Hey, how rare is this...

136
00:11:46,156 --> 00:11:49,326
-What's so touching about this? -Hey, he said he loves me.

137
00:11:58,368 --> 00:12:00,504
What are you doing?

138
00:12:01,571 --> 00:12:04,174
-What are you doing? -Welcome, welcome.

139
00:12:04,207 --> 00:12:06,076
I just came back and you give me this.

140
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:09,813
This, isn't this too much?

141
00:12:14,184 --> 00:12:16,820
It feels so foreign? Our Korea?

142
00:12:18,255 --> 00:12:19,656
No presents?

143
00:12:19,723 --> 00:12:20,891
Of course there are presents.

144
00:12:20,957 --> 00:12:23,560
Needless to say, I have presents for the members.

145
00:12:23,627 --> 00:12:26,596
-Hello. -I just returned from Europe.

146
00:12:26,663 --> 00:12:28,632
Yes.

147
00:12:28,699 --> 00:12:30,967
Today's race, will start when Gary enters the country.

148
00:12:31,034 --> 00:12:33,670
-Immediately? -Ok, bring the bags in.

149
00:12:33,704 --> 00:12:36,673
What's that?

150
00:12:36,707 --> 00:12:40,343
Oh, one for each.

151
00:12:42,412 --> 00:12:47,017
Ok, inside these bags today, are extremely important tools for today's race.

152
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:49,920
Starting from now, everyone will take a bag.

153
00:12:49,953 --> 00:12:52,789
-Randomly? -Beacuse you can't open them.

154
00:12:52,856 --> 00:12:55,258
-Please think carefully before taking it. -Are they different?

155
00:12:55,325 --> 00:12:59,062
-Didn't he tell you to 'think through it carefully'? -I don't know, aigoo!

156
00:12:59,096 --> 00:13:01,164
-I've picked mine. -Kook Jong!

157
00:13:01,264 --> 00:13:04,935
-These are all different right, the contents? -They should be different

158
00:13:05,001 --> 00:13:09,639
-Oh, mine is so heavy. -Mine too.

159
00:13:09,639 --> 00:13:12,342
-Mine's extremely heavy. -Everyone's all the same?

160
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:14,978
-Mine's heavy. -What does Gary do today?

161
00:13:15,045 --> 00:13:18,115
-Oh, it's Kang Gary! -Oh, Kang Gary!

162
00:13:18,181 --> 00:13:21,051
Gary hyung!

163
00:13:21,118 --> 00:13:23,720
Hey, he doesn't look like came back from Europe?

164
00:13:23,754 --> 00:13:25,055
Gary!

165
00:13:25,088 --> 00:13:26,857
He doesn't look like he came back from Europe?

166
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:28,358
Oh, Gary!

167
00:13:28,425 --> 00:13:30,160
Lollol!

168
00:13:30,227 --> 00:13:32,662
Oh, it's really the Lollols?

169
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:34,931
Oh, Lollols.

170
00:13:34,965 --> 00:13:38,635
It's really thank to the Lollols that I had a good trip.

171
00:13:38,668 --> 00:13:40,237
Yes, danke schoen.

172
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:44,307
-What's happening there? -What's going on?

173
00:13:45,442 --> 00:13:46,877
It's the Lollols, the Lollols.

174
00:13:46,943 --> 00:13:49,646
It's because of them that Gary hyung could go on his trip.

175
00:13:50,547 --> 00:13:52,516
What are you doing here?

176
00:13:52,516 --> 00:13:55,986
Are you really here to meet me? Let's go.

177
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:58,922
-Why are you in formal wear? -Gary!

178
00:13:58,955 --> 00:14:00,757
-Gary hyung! Gary!

179
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:13,470
Why are you doing?

180
00:14:14,204 --> 00:14:17,808
-Oh, what's all this? -Why are you doing this, why are you doing this?

181
00:14:17,841 --> 00:14:20,877
-What,why are you doing this? -What, what?

182
00:14:21,645 --> 00:14:25,215
-Gary! -Why are you taking my bag?

183
00:14:28,185 --> 00:14:31,188
My bag, Lollol! Lollol! Lollol!

184
00:14:33,623 --> 00:14:36,693
Why are you taking my bag? My bag, Lollol!

185
00:14:42,766 --> 00:14:47,204
My bag, Lollol! Lollol! Lollol!

186
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:51,208
Hey, what's going on?

187
00:14:51,241 --> 00:14:53,677
-What's this? -Where are they taking him?

188
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:55,879
-What are they doing? -What's going on?

189
00:14:55,946 --> 00:14:58,014
-What? -You're not bringing me along?

190
00:15:03,253 --> 00:15:05,889
-A trip to Europe! -We can't go together.

191
00:15:05,956 --> 00:15:08,992
Oh, Lollols. We'll go to Jeju island to play next time.

192
00:15:21,972 --> 00:15:24,107
Oh, what's this, what are you doing?

193
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:27,577
No, just...Myeok PD, please stop coming near me.

194
00:15:28,678 --> 00:15:31,281
Where are you taking me?

195
00:15:37,654 --> 00:15:40,457
Inside Gary's stolen backpack is a precious treasure from Europe,

196
00:15:40,523 --> 00:15:43,260
-A treasure? -Hey, we have to find the bag.

197
00:15:51,668 --> 00:15:55,171
What's going to happen again today? It's making us nervous.

198
00:15:55,205 --> 00:15:57,073
Where did Gary oppa go?

199
00:15:57,173 --> 00:16:00,543
Ok, we'll start giving you the mission now.

200
00:16:00,577 --> 00:16:04,881
Before we give you the mission, we'll be confiscating your handphones.

201
00:16:04,948 --> 00:16:06,549
Why, why?

202
00:16:06,616 --> 00:16:10,153
My mom will call me. It won't do.

203
00:16:10,186 --> 00:16:11,788
Why?

204
00:16:12,789 --> 00:16:15,025
Jeez, they're taking everything away.

205
00:16:15,058 --> 00:16:18,261
Today's mission is 'Gary knows'.

206
00:16:18,295 --> 00:16:21,097
-'Gary knows'? -'Gary knows'?

207
00:16:27,804 --> 00:16:31,975
The item inside everyone's bags is a question card about episodes during Gary's trip.

208
00:16:36,046 --> 00:16:39,482
Fill in the answers for those questions to find out the location of the mission backpack.

209
00:16:39,549 --> 00:16:42,786
How did he do so many things in Europe?

210
00:16:46,589 --> 00:16:49,259
Gary ate blank in Germany.

211
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:53,396
Gary ate a, blank sausage in Germany.

212
00:16:58,568 --> 00:17:02,205
Hey, It says 'three' here.

213
00:17:02,238 --> 00:17:05,375
I already know this one.

214
00:17:09,379 --> 00:17:12,215
Gary received the 'Find Gerald mission' at Trafaigar Square.

215
00:17:12,282 --> 00:17:14,985
Why is there an answer here?

216
00:17:16,386 --> 00:17:20,924
-You have tracking devices in the bag... -Yes.

217
00:17:22,993 --> 00:17:26,696
In the device, you can see the locations of hints for the questions.

218
00:17:28,765 --> 00:17:32,268
Once someone finds a hint, the indicator will disappear.

219
00:17:32,335 --> 00:17:35,405
We're at Incheon Airport, right?

220
00:17:35,472 --> 00:17:38,775
Hey, what's this?

221
00:17:38,842 --> 00:17:40,944
Central Park.

222
00:17:40,977 --> 00:17:43,146
Where we went the other time?

223
00:17:43,213 --> 00:17:46,816
Where we have the Spy special.

224
00:17:49,419 --> 00:17:50,987
What's with the key?

225
00:17:51,054 --> 00:17:55,992
All items in your bag are important so please keep them well.

226
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:03,033
Oh, it's Songdo.

227
00:18:03,066 --> 00:18:05,935
What did Gary ate in Europe?

228
00:18:05,969 --> 00:18:08,304
What's the key for too?

229
00:18:08,371 --> 00:18:11,775
We may have to unlock a door somewhere.

230
00:18:11,808 --> 00:18:15,445
'Gary knows'. Then, I should find Gary hyung?

231
00:18:15,512 --> 00:18:18,548
Gary hyung, hang in there. I'll save you!

232
00:18:18,615 --> 00:18:20,650
Where are you taking me?

233
00:18:31,194 --> 00:18:33,430
Is it here?

234
00:18:46,042 --> 00:18:47,510
-Gary. -Hyung.

235
00:18:47,577 --> 00:18:50,313
-What are you doing? -You found me?

236
00:18:50,413 --> 00:18:52,248
Hey, what's going on?

237
00:18:52,315 --> 00:18:55,552
-Hyung, I'm here to look for my bag. -Why are you here?

238
00:18:55,585 --> 00:18:58,788
I don't know. I was dragged here, by Myeok PD.

239
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:02,225
-Gary. -Yes, hyung.

240
00:19:02,292 --> 00:19:04,494
You...

241
00:19:04,527 --> 00:19:06,329
-Hey. -Hyung,why are you here, hyung?

242
00:19:06,362 --> 00:19:09,332
I need your help with today's theme. Today is "Gary knows".

243
00:19:09,365 --> 00:19:10,700
-What's that? -You know all these things.

244
00:19:13,736 --> 00:19:16,773
Gary boarded the Eurostar at blank, that set off at blank pm. Do you know?

245
00:19:16,806 --> 00:19:21,411
I just followed them so I don't know. You know me, hyung.

246
00:19:21,444 --> 00:19:23,113
Hey, so what did you eat in Germany?

247
00:19:23,146 --> 00:19:25,181
In Germany?

248
00:19:25,215 --> 00:19:27,050
-There were so many. -What exactly did you eat?

249
00:19:40,296 --> 00:19:42,799
Hey, it's great.

250
00:19:43,366 --> 00:19:45,802
Germany's sausages are very famous right, their sausages?

251
00:19:46,836 --> 00:19:49,806
Frankfurt. Frank sausages.

252
00:19:50,306 --> 00:19:52,976
Frank sausages!

253
00:19:53,009 --> 00:19:56,346
I'm starting to understand Europe now.

254
00:19:59,883 --> 00:20:04,020
Wow, where is this? It has the smell of Germany.

255
00:20:05,488 --> 00:20:07,991
Food, Frankfurt food.

256
00:20:09,592 --> 00:20:11,594
Sausages!

257
00:20:11,661 --> 00:20:13,029
Oh, sausages!

258
00:20:18,835 --> 00:20:22,639
This is Frankfurt's traditional wine, apple wine.

259
00:20:24,607 --> 00:20:26,342
Korean culture.

260
00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:30,547
Two hands.

261
00:20:32,448 --> 00:20:35,418
-Thank you. You're welcome.

262
00:20:59,375 --> 00:21:01,711
There's so many different meats.

263
00:21:01,744 --> 00:21:03,513
This is schweinshaxe.

264
00:21:05,982 --> 00:21:08,551
Schweinshaxe is German style pig knuckle.

265
00:21:09,852 --> 00:21:11,421
Do I just eat it like this?

266
00:21:29,305 --> 00:21:32,375
Wow, this is good. The sauce...

267
00:21:35,712 --> 00:21:38,514
Wow, the German pig trotter,very tender.

268
00:21:38,581 --> 00:21:42,619
-What is it called again? -Schweinshaxe.

269
00:21:42,685 --> 00:21:44,654
Schweinshaxe!

270
00:21:46,356 --> 00:21:48,191
Ah.

271
00:21:49,959 --> 00:21:51,961
Why is it so delicious?

272
00:22:07,977 --> 00:22:09,946
What did you eat in Germany?

273
00:22:09,979 --> 00:22:11,814
Germany, right?

274
00:22:14,017 --> 00:22:17,253
I ate a lot! I ate romance!

275
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:21,224
Frankfurt...sausages? Germany is famous for their sausages.

276
00:22:22,125 --> 00:22:24,027
-Beer? -I ate romance, romance.

277
00:22:24,093 --> 00:22:26,596
-Ah, you ate romance? -Why are you asking me all this?

278
00:22:26,629 --> 00:22:28,898
There are the questions we have to ask you.

279
00:22:28,965 --> 00:22:31,367
Am I not supposed to tell you so easily then?

280
00:22:31,401 --> 00:22:33,303
It's not like that, you can just tell me.

281
00:22:35,338 --> 00:22:39,075
-I have to go find my bag. -Where did you go to find Gerard? England?

282
00:22:39,108 --> 00:22:43,413
-Why are you interrogating me,hyungnim! -I'm not interrogating you!

283
00:22:43,446 --> 00:22:45,348
I went there to enjoy freedom!

284
00:22:47,383 --> 00:22:50,787
I'm asking because you went to Europe, give me some hints.

285
00:22:55,792 --> 00:22:59,395
Oh! It's Gary hyung!

286
00:22:59,462 --> 00:23:01,931
It's "Gary knows", rignt?

287
00:23:05,268 --> 00:23:10,106
-Just give me one answer. -I didn't just eat one or two things in Germany.

288
00:23:10,139 --> 00:23:12,975
-Right. -So let me look at the question.

289
00:23:13,042 --> 00:23:15,378
Hyung!

290
00:23:16,446 --> 00:23:20,850
Why are you all looking for me, I need to find my bag!

291
00:23:21,684 --> 00:23:25,588
Hyung I'm done for if I can't find my bag.

292
00:23:25,655 --> 00:23:28,057
-Hold on. -It's okay.

293
00:23:28,124 --> 00:23:31,828
Walt! This kind of disorder would nerver happen in Europe.

294
00:23:34,397 --> 00:23:35,965
But Hyung...

295
00:23:35,998 --> 00:23:38,201
Why! Don't touch me!

296
00:23:45,341 --> 00:23:48,344
Okay, let's find a hint first.

297
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:24,714
After finding the tapes, the hint should be in the tape.

298
00:24:28,351 --> 00:24:33,055
After finding the tapes and play in with the video player, I will find the answers to these.

299
00:24:51,107 --> 00:24:54,076
It's Avantar, Avantar!

300
00:25:14,397 --> 00:25:17,233
Gary ate an Avatar in Germany?

301
00:25:23,773 --> 00:25:25,441
Kwang Soo!

302
00:25:31,314 --> 00:25:33,683
Hyung do you have the player?

303
00:25:36,886 --> 00:25:40,356
How are you going to finish this by yourself if you can't even do this.

304
00:25:48,431 --> 00:25:49,432
Why are you like this?

305
00:25:49,499 --> 00:25:52,635
What are you doing?

306
00:25:57,707 --> 00:26:01,844
Is that all?

307
00:26:05,882 --> 00:26:09,719
The real hints have the videos of Gary's Europe travels.

308
00:26:09,785 --> 00:26:11,387
There are fakers too?

309
00:26:11,954 --> 00:26:12,889
Ah, this...

310
00:26:14,557 --> 00:26:17,527
I was just about to say... It's the first time I've worded well with hyung.

311
00:26:17,593 --> 00:26:21,764
So there are a lot of videos, but only one is real.

312
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:42,518
Fake.

313
00:26:48,624 --> 00:26:50,026
Fake.

314
00:26:55,865 --> 00:26:56,899
Just tell me one answer, just one. So that I can complete the sentence.

315
00:26:57,233 --> 00:26:59,669
If I tell you, I wouldn't be penalized would I?

316
00:26:59,735 --> 00:27:02,071
You won't, why would you?

317
00:27:04,774 --> 00:27:07,143
Hey, Sherlock. What are you up to?

318
00:27:07,176 --> 00:27:08,744
Gary.

319
00:27:10,446 --> 00:27:12,949
Hyung, I went to Shamp-Elysees!

320
00:27:13,015 --> 00:27:16,686
It's Champ-Elysees, not Shamp-Elysees!

321
00:27:16,752 --> 00:27:18,354
Champ-Elysees!

322
00:27:19,055 --> 00:27:21,190
I will continue walking on the path of freedom.

323
00:27:21,257 --> 00:27:23,526
Do not stop this wanderer's footsteps!

324
00:27:24,193 --> 00:27:26,662
-Gary, come over here. -I'm very sleepy right now!

325
00:27:26,696 --> 00:27:30,600
-I flew for 20 hours. -Are you doing this again?

326
00:27:33,336 --> 00:27:35,738
Gary, you just have to fill it out. This is your homework.

327
00:27:35,771 --> 00:27:38,641
-I want to go home! -Hurry up and read it.

328
00:27:42,111 --> 00:27:43,012
I haven't even called my mom yet! -What did you eat in Germany?

329
00:27:46,616 --> 00:27:48,651
Guten Tag! Guten Tag!

330
00:27:48,684 --> 00:27:50,386
Guten Tag! Guten Morgen!

331
00:27:50,419 --> 00:27:51,253
Danke!

332
00:27:52,355 --> 00:27:54,223
Fine, let's do it this way.

333
00:27:54,256 --> 00:27:57,660
Everybody seems to be very curious about my trip to Europe.

334
00:27:57,693 --> 00:28:00,963
-So I will answer one question per person. -Okay I understand I'll ask first since I came first.

335
00:28:00,997 --> 00:28:03,866
Please wait. Hay-Hay, please wait a moment.

336
00:28:04,467 --> 00:28:06,335
Tell me the answer to this one.

337
00:28:11,007 --> 00:28:12,675
Hyung, about this one...

338
00:28:20,716 --> 00:28:22,952
Oh, St. Pancras Station.

339
00:28:25,154 --> 00:28:27,256
Oh, St. Pancras Station.

340
00:28:27,289 --> 00:28:28,691
Oh, here?

341
00:28:29,625 --> 00:28:31,994
-What was it? -St. Pancras Station.

342
00:28:33,462 --> 00:28:37,700
-Is this a nice station? -Uhm, what are we taking to get to Paris?

343
00:28:37,733 --> 00:28:39,502
-Euro train. -Eurostar.

344
00:28:39,568 --> 00:28:41,537
Eurostar. We board it from there.

345
00:28:41,604 --> 00:28:43,239
St. Pancras Station?

346
00:28:55,184 --> 00:28:57,753
So, this place is called...

347
00:28:57,787 --> 00:29:00,222
This is... What station did you say this was again?

348
00:29:01,323 --> 00:29:03,759
-In order to go to Paris... -St...

349
00:29:03,826 --> 00:29:06,362
You can get on the Eurostar here.

350
00:29:06,395 --> 00:29:09,165
You can go to Paris by taking the Eurostar here.

351
00:29:09,198 --> 00:29:11,801
-St. Pancras Station. -St. Pancras.

352
00:29:11,834 --> 00:29:13,469
Crass?Cross?

353
00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:16,806
-Cras. -It is St. Pancras Station.

354
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:20,009
Oh, there. St. Pancras.

355
00:29:29,785 --> 00:29:31,854
-Here? -Carriage 1.

356
00:29:32,755 --> 00:29:35,591
-Where is the carriage number written? -It is written here.

357
00:29:40,629 --> 00:29:43,032
In our country. It's usually written here? On the train.

358
00:29:44,166 --> 00:29:45,901
We get in now?

359
00:30:07,757 --> 00:30:10,359
-My memory is blurry. -Just do it.

360
00:30:10,359 --> 00:30:12,394
I think it was 1:03pm.

361
00:30:16,365 --> 00:30:17,700
You didn't use the KTX right?

362
00:30:17,767 --> 00:30:20,636
I'm not sure. I'm a Europer.

363
00:30:20,636 --> 00:30:23,405
Then, this question. What did you eat there?

364
00:30:23,472 --> 00:30:25,641
I ate sausages in Germany.

365
00:30:25,674 --> 00:30:28,444
And I ate it with romance.

366
00:30:28,911 --> 00:30:29,912
Hay- Hay.

367
00:30:29,945 --> 00:30:31,514
Hyungnim, I love you.

368
00:30:31,547 --> 00:30:34,817
-Just hear about my trip to Europe. -He heard it too.

369
00:30:34,850 --> 00:30:36,352
He didn't hear it.

370
00:30:36,385 --> 00:30:38,053
-You heard what he ate? -No, I didn't.

371
00:30:38,087 --> 00:30:40,389
-You obviously heard it. -Korean cuisines?

372
00:30:42,625 --> 00:30:46,829
-I ate sea-snails, sea-snails. -The one who changes my mood.

373
00:30:47,897 --> 00:30:50,299
The one who always ignores me.

374
00:30:53,869 --> 00:30:55,404
Hyung, hyung.

375
00:30:55,437 --> 00:30:58,140
Please do not stop the wanderer's footsteps.

376
00:31:00,576 --> 00:31:03,379
The place where you took Gary Potter picture.

377
00:31:03,412 --> 00:31:08,117
Gary Potter. Where was it?

378
00:31:17,226 --> 00:31:19,228
-Is King Cross far? -No.

379
00:31:19,295 --> 00:31:20,796
It's right there.

380
00:31:29,205 --> 00:31:32,107
Is this King's Cross street?

381
00:31:40,449 --> 00:31:41,150
Where?

382
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:44,186
What's this?

383
00:31:44,587 --> 00:31:49,258
Platform numbers should not have fractions, right?

384
00:31:49,325 --> 00:31:53,562
This only exists in Harry Potter. Platform 9 and 3/4.

385
00:32:11,881 --> 00:32:13,782
I need to go from there?

386
00:32:15,217 --> 00:32:18,821
I'm going. Don't look for me.

387
00:32:21,624 --> 00:32:23,926
I wondered why you bought the glasses...

388
00:32:23,993 --> 00:32:25,995
Did you buy it for me?

389
00:32:29,531 --> 00:32:31,166
It doesn't fit me.

390
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,502
Why didn't you buy something that matches me.

391
00:32:36,005 --> 00:32:39,608
Gary Potter will now take Eurostar to Paris.

392
00:32:40,009 --> 00:32:41,677
Lollol, lollol!

393
00:32:43,846 --> 00:32:45,748
Is that enough?

394
00:32:46,248 --> 00:32:50,853
Harry Potter went from here. But I'm Gary Potter so I go from here.

395
00:32:52,454 --> 00:32:54,924
It's just a prop. It won't go in.

396
00:32:54,990 --> 00:32:56,659
Push it hard.

397
00:32:57,092 --> 00:32:59,695
Lollol!

398
00:33:20,983 --> 00:33:23,686
Subway station.

399
00:33:24,987 --> 00:33:28,457
Really? How about this?

400
00:33:28,891 --> 00:33:31,994
Eurostar, isn't that Tevez?

401
00:33:32,061 --> 00:33:35,531
-Tevez is a France train. -It's T.G.V.

402
00:33:35,564 --> 00:33:37,366
-TGV? --It's T.G.V.

403
00:33:38,901 --> 00:33:43,339
Tevez is Park Ji Sung's friend, right?

404
00:33:43,405 --> 00:33:45,674
Looks like I have to go to Europe again.

405
00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:12,634
Huh? What's this. Isn't that Bong Sun?

406
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:20,309
What is this?

407
00:34:27,383 --> 00:34:30,085
Bong Sun, how have you been.

408
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:41,030
Just now Jong Kook...

409
00:34:44,066 --> 00:34:47,503
How are we supposed to find this?

410
00:35:00,349 --> 00:35:02,418
It surprised me.

411
00:35:02,484 --> 00:35:04,620
How do we find it when it's hidden there.

412
00:35:06,522 --> 00:35:09,091
Oh! This is it!

413
00:35:09,124 --> 00:35:10,559
It's Gary.

414
00:35:29,945 --> 00:35:32,581
Is this King's Cross?

415
00:35:50,165 --> 00:35:54,736
It won't move. It's just a prop.

416
00:35:56,505 --> 00:35:58,674
Lollol!

417
00:36:05,848 --> 00:36:07,282
King's Cross.

418
00:36:22,531 --> 00:36:26,068
Wow.. This... I almost fell into a maze if not for this.

419
00:36:33,976 --> 00:36:36,712
There shouldn't be anything here, right?

420
00:36:38,714 --> 00:36:40,215
Oh, there's one here.

421
00:36:44,853 --> 00:36:46,455
Got it!

422
00:36:46,522 --> 00:36:50,659
How can it be found when it's hidden here.

423
00:37:02,037 --> 00:37:04,339
Eurostar...

424
00:37:10,812 --> 00:37:13,782
-Where's the carriage number? -Here.

425
00:37:17,653 --> 00:37:20,355
Our country's number is on here, on the carriage.

426
00:37:29,064 --> 00:37:30,732
Eurostar?

427
00:37:30,766 --> 00:37:33,101
What time did it leave in the afternoon?

428
00:37:33,135 --> 00:37:36,505
It's 2 in afternoon.

429
00:37:52,087 --> 00:37:55,157
Shouldn't there be more than one hint?

430
00:38:13,709 --> 00:38:15,510
Is it a hint?

431
00:38:19,281 --> 00:38:21,450
Is this a hint?

432
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,263
What is this?

433
00:38:34,329 --> 00:38:36,064
It's a newspaper.

434
00:38:56,285 --> 00:38:57,919
What?

435
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:00,022
Kang Gary!

436
00:39:00,088 --> 00:39:01,423
What??

437
00:39:08,196 --> 00:39:08,764
Nice.

438
00:39:09,598 --> 00:39:11,767
I'm so sleepy.

439
00:39:17,372 --> 00:39:19,074
Kang Gary!

440
00:39:19,541 --> 00:39:22,244
-Ah Ji Hyo, can I rest for awhile? -Kang Gary!

441
00:39:22,311 --> 00:39:24,880
Now is not the time to sleep.

442
00:39:24,913 --> 00:39:25,447
Hurry up and come out.

443
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:26,715
Kang Gary!

444
00:39:26,815 --> 00:39:30,752
Kang Gary hurry up and tell me what you know.

445
00:39:30,819 --> 00:39:33,588
-Are you sleepy? -I'm going crazy.

446
00:39:34,323 --> 00:39:35,824
I'm really sleepy.

447
00:39:35,857 --> 00:39:38,460
-He can't talk properly now. -Can you find my bag?

448
00:39:38,527 --> 00:39:41,830
Oppa, before I find your bag shouldn't you tell me something?

449
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:47,469
-Alright, I'll tell you what you want to know. -What did you eat in Europe?

450
00:39:47,536 --> 00:39:49,671
Meals.

451
00:39:49,738 --> 00:39:51,740
Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner.

452
00:39:51,807 --> 00:39:53,875
And romance.

453
00:39:57,546 --> 00:40:01,450
-This game doesn't seem to be related to me. Hurry up and find my bag. -Oppa, but what is this?

454
00:40:01,483 --> 00:40:03,251
This is the newspaper I read.

455
00:40:03,285 --> 00:40:06,688
-Oppa you read this? -Yeah, the economics column and...

456
00:40:06,755 --> 00:40:09,725
There was a lot of information.

457
00:40:09,791 --> 00:40:12,327
It's the newspaper that I read when I was in Germany.

458
00:40:12,394 --> 00:40:15,564
-It's the most famous in Germany. -So, where did you meet Mr.Gerald?

459
00:40:15,597 --> 00:40:16,531
Just tell me that.

460
00:40:16,598 --> 00:40:18,367
I met him in the UK.

461
00:40:26,975 --> 00:40:30,078
I have to quickly view everything. Because it's my only chance.

462
00:40:30,078 --> 00:40:30,879
Because it's my first and last time, I have to quickly view everything.

463
00:40:30,946 --> 00:40:34,015
It's the black structure in front.

464
00:40:34,049 --> 00:40:35,984
I saw it! I quickly saw it!

465
00:40:36,051 --> 00:40:38,920
Everything seems to be happening in a very fast speed.

466
00:40:38,987 --> 00:40:41,323
The England's sausage and beef tongue and

467
00:40:41,356 --> 00:40:42,257
You mean Germany?

468
00:40:42,290 --> 00:40:43,725
Oh, Germany.

469
00:40:43,759 --> 00:40:45,827
Look! I'm all confused now!

470
00:40:45,894 --> 00:40:49,898
Because the countries have been changing every 12 hours!

471
00:40:54,970 --> 00:40:59,775
Wow, this is so great!

472
00:41:06,448 --> 00:41:08,250
Gerald?

473
00:41:11,253 --> 00:41:13,688
Can't you just let me tour around here freely?

474
00:41:14,823 --> 00:41:18,693
IS Gerald the name of a young man or an old man?

475
00:41:18,727 --> 00:41:20,662
There are a lot of people with this name in UK.

476
00:41:20,695 --> 00:41:23,598
A lot of people named Gerald?

477
00:41:25,667 --> 00:41:27,235
Hello.

478
00:41:27,302 --> 00:41:29,438
Are you Korean?

479
00:41:29,504 --> 00:41:30,005
Running Man.

480
00:41:30,005 --> 00:41:32,007
Hello.

481
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:35,577
Wow. The popularity of Running Man carries on to the UK too.

482
00:41:35,644 --> 00:41:37,245
This is really no joke!

483
00:41:37,312 --> 00:41:40,348
Excuse me. Excuse me.

484
00:41:40,415 --> 00:41:43,351
Are you Gerrald? Gerrald?

485
00:41:43,418 --> 00:41:45,387
You name is Gerald?

486
00:41:46,655 --> 00:41:48,523
-No, he's David. -David?

487
00:41:48,557 --> 00:41:49,157
Sorry.

488
00:41:49,658 --> 00:41:51,526
Excuse me,sir.

489
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:54,696
Are you Gerrald? You name is Gerald?

490
00:41:54,729 --> 00:41:57,365
No no.

491
00:41:57,399 --> 00:41:59,634
Wrong person.

492
00:42:02,504 --> 00:42:03,772
Ah, Gerald

493
00:42:03,805 --> 00:42:08,710
Ah Mr.Gerald... I mean, even if we say there are a lot of "Min Seok's" in Korea.

494
00:42:08,777 --> 00:42:11,012
How are you supposed to find a "Min Seok"?!

495
00:42:23,024 --> 00:42:24,826
Gerald!

496
00:42:27,562 --> 00:42:28,830
Gerald!

497
00:42:32,634 --> 00:42:35,103
Gerald!

498
00:42:44,679 --> 00:42:46,281
Trafalgar!

499
00:42:49,284 --> 00:42:50,886
Trafalgar?

500
00:42:50,919 --> 00:42:51,453
8th Street.

501
00:42:57,259 --> 00:42:58,660
Trafalgar?

502
00:42:58,727 --> 00:42:59,628
8th Street!

503
00:42:59,661 --> 00:43:03,865
London's 5th Street, 6th Street, 7th Street... is like Euljio's 4th Street, 3rd Street.

504
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:08,069
I think there's Tra 1st Street, 2nd Street, 3rd Street.

505
00:43:08,103 --> 00:43:09,704
The 8th Street.

506
00:43:09,738 --> 00:43:11,406
Why are you lying?

507
00:43:11,439 --> 00:43:13,174
I'm not lying. It's true.

508
00:43:13,208 --> 00:43:15,744
Is England like Korea? Why would they name it "8th Street"?

509
00:43:15,810 --> 00:43:18,613
Isn't there something like block1, block 2 or something?

510
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:21,683
Then shouldn't 8th Street be said in English? Why would they use "8th Street" (in Korean)?

511
00:43:21,716 --> 00:43:23,351
Tra Eight Street!

512
00:43:23,385 --> 00:43:24,786
What?

513
00:43:24,853 --> 00:43:26,321
Anyway Ji Hyo, can you help me to find my backpack?

514
00:43:26,354 --> 00:43:28,423
-Ok, I'll find your bag for you. -Seriously.

515
00:43:28,490 --> 00:43:30,692
You follow me today. Come here.

516
00:43:30,725 --> 00:43:32,193
But I want to sleep.

517
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:35,764
I know. The treasure is in Oppa's bag pack.

518
00:43:35,797 --> 00:43:39,467
-I will find it for you as fast as I can. -Don't tell the others that I'm here they are very irritating.

519
00:43:39,534 --> 00:43:41,469
All right.

520
00:43:41,536 --> 00:43:43,772
-I'll look for you later. -Ok.

521
00:43:43,838 --> 00:43:45,373
You are telling the truth?

522
00:43:49,177 --> 00:43:51,179
Ah, I'm so sleepy!

523
00:43:55,750 --> 00:43:59,588
It was a very windy day.

524
00:44:23,178 --> 00:44:24,779
Dong Hoon Hyung

525
00:44:24,879 --> 00:44:27,215
Dong Hoon Hyung!

526
00:44:29,651 --> 00:44:32,187
Oh, HaHa hyung ran this way a little while ago.

527
00:44:32,253 --> 00:44:34,255
But he's not here.

528
00:44:34,289 --> 00:44:35,624
Dong Hoon Hyung!

529
00:44:35,690 --> 00:44:36,524
He's like a ghost.

530
00:44:36,558 --> 00:44:37,392
Dong Hoon Hyung!

531
00:44:37,459 --> 00:44:41,596
Has he been learning something recently?

532
00:44:41,630 --> 00:44:43,832
-How did he disappear all of a sudden? -Dong Hoon Hyung!

533
00:44:43,865 --> 00:44:47,769
-Oh, it's been a red light all along. -He's seriously making me go crazy.

534
00:44:47,836 --> 00:44:48,970
Hey!

535
00:44:49,804 --> 00:44:51,673
Where did Jae Suk Hyung go?

536
00:44:51,673 --> 00:44:53,308
What happened? Where did he go?

537
00:44:53,375 --> 00:44:55,644
Wasn't Jae Suk here just now?

538
00:44:56,444 --> 00:44:59,381
-Ah, you surprised me! -Haha, you couldn't see me, right?

539
00:44:59,414 --> 00:45:02,083
It was a perfect green camouflage.

540
00:45:02,117 --> 00:45:05,620
How amazing. Your skills remain the same.

541
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:09,224
Kwang Soo,get up!

542
00:45:09,224 --> 00:45:12,293
Kwang Soo,get up quickly! Get up!

543
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:14,863
-You'll freeze to death. -What are you doing?

544
00:45:19,134 --> 00:45:20,502
Cold!

545
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:27,776
Why is it so cold today?

546
00:45:37,552 --> 00:45:39,921
-Hyung, I heard there's a cold snap starting from today. -Excatly.

547
00:45:50,665 --> 00:45:52,967
-The park is here. Come here. -Hyung.

548
00:45:53,034 --> 00:45:54,536
It's not that.

549
00:45:54,602 --> 00:45:55,737
But there are so many boxes.

550
00:45:55,804 --> 00:45:57,605
Then you go and take a look.

551
00:45:57,639 --> 00:46:01,076
Hyung!Why are you ordering me to do things as if I'm a dog!

552
00:46:03,144 --> 00:46:05,346
Don't stand there blankly!

553
00:46:18,126 --> 00:46:19,127
Kwang Soo!

554
00:46:22,130 --> 00:46:23,064
We are the ones who search regardless of reasons.

555
00:46:23,064 --> 00:46:26,067
Lee Yoo Cross!

556
00:46:26,134 --> 00:46:27,869
What are you doing?

557
00:46:27,936 --> 00:46:29,971
We are the Easy Brothers!

558
00:46:30,505 --> 00:46:32,173
You traitor!

559
00:46:32,207 --> 00:46:33,742
Then...

560
00:46:33,775 --> 00:46:35,310
Show us yours.

561
00:46:35,343 --> 00:46:36,878
Hyung, you found the tape, right?

562
00:46:36,911 --> 00:46:40,348
You know the purpose of finding that thing?

563
00:46:40,381 --> 00:46:42,417
So cold, so cold.

564
00:46:43,618 --> 00:46:45,553
Are you Easy or Lee Yoo?

565
00:46:45,587 --> 00:46:48,089
You created Lee Yoo brothers just like this?

566
00:46:48,156 --> 00:46:51,893
That's how we are "Lee Yoo Ji"!

567
00:46:51,893 --> 00:46:54,129
That's right! We are Lee Yoo Ji!

568
00:46:54,195 --> 00:46:56,030
If we're together, we're...

569
00:46:56,064 --> 00:46:57,932
-Lee Yoo Ji -Lee Yoo Ji

570
00:46:57,966 --> 00:46:59,167
What is this? Seriously.

571
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:00,869
How could you say Lee Yoo Ji all by yourself?

572
00:47:00,902 --> 00:47:03,538
The 3 of us are : Lee Yoo Ji!

573
00:47:03,571 --> 00:47:05,607
-Lee Yoo Ji! -Cross!

574
00:47:05,673 --> 00:47:06,474
-Lee Yoo Ji! -Cross.

575
00:47:06,508 --> 00:47:08,343
How could there be a cross with three?

576
00:47:08,376 --> 00:47:10,278
That's exactly how we are if we're together.

577
00:47:10,345 --> 00:47:12,080
Lee! Yoo! Ji! Cross!

578
00:47:17,152 --> 00:47:19,320
-You shocked me! -Why did you suddenly raise your hand up?

579
00:47:19,354 --> 00:47:21,856
It's not like this.

580
00:47:22,423 --> 00:47:25,760
Why did you suddenly raise your hand up? This is too childish.

581
00:47:25,794 --> 00:47:29,631
-Hyung, tell me. Why are you looking for this thing? -You don't know?

582
00:47:29,664 --> 00:47:32,167
Hyung, tell me the truth. You found that already right?

583
00:47:32,233 --> 00:47:33,735
I'll show you what I have.

584
00:47:33,802 --> 00:47:36,271
We are Lee Yoo Ji. How can I not show you?

585
00:47:36,304 --> 00:47:38,439
-I'll show you. -Yes take it out and let us see.

586
00:47:42,877 --> 00:47:45,313
Show me something now.

587
00:47:45,346 --> 00:47:46,781
There's nothing in here!

588
00:47:46,848 --> 00:47:48,850
I'm jealous of you two working together!

589
00:47:48,917 --> 00:47:53,054
-What? We are just filming a show together. -Hey! What are you saying?

590
00:47:53,054 --> 00:47:56,090
Why are you jealous? We are just filming a show together.

591
00:47:56,124 --> 00:47:58,259
Because the both of you are together.

592
00:47:58,326 --> 00:48:00,028
What are you saying?

593
00:48:00,094 --> 00:48:02,964
Why are you jealous? It's not like we are filming a drama together.

594
00:48:02,997 --> 00:48:05,900
-No it's not like this. -What? Hey! Kwang Soo, let's go!

595
00:48:05,967 --> 00:48:07,302
We can't stay here anymore.

596
00:48:10,772 --> 00:48:12,640
Ah, seriously.

597
00:48:26,020 --> 00:48:27,255
It should be somewhere here.

598
00:48:27,322 --> 00:48:28,389
Hyung!

599
00:48:28,456 --> 00:48:29,257
Kwang Soo, it's here!

600
00:48:41,469 --> 00:48:43,938
We found it.

601
00:48:44,005 --> 00:48:46,241
What is inside?

602
00:48:57,018 --> 00:49:01,956
Kwang Soo, we have to hide something with this.

603
00:49:02,023 --> 00:49:04,826
We have to hide something with this.

604
00:49:37,859 --> 00:49:39,193
He's sleeping. Hyung!

605
00:49:39,227 --> 00:49:41,562
I'm dying.

606
00:49:41,596 --> 00:49:43,598
Hyung! Tell me a hint quickly!

607
00:49:43,631 --> 00:49:45,400
Where did you meet Mr.Gerald, hyung!

608
00:49:45,466 --> 00:49:47,101
Trafalgar

609
00:49:47,135 --> 00:49:48,569
What?

610
00:49:48,603 --> 00:49:49,137
Trafalgar 8th Street.

611
00:49:49,137 --> 00:49:51,139
Trafalgar?

612
00:49:51,172 --> 00:49:54,475
It's like Euljiro's 3rd Street, 4th Street...

613
00:49:54,475 --> 00:49:56,711
I've a survey card with me.

614
00:49:56,744 --> 00:49:59,447
Let's quickly solve these questions and end this.

615
00:49:59,514 --> 00:50:01,316
Help me find my bag.

616
00:50:01,349 --> 00:50:02,850
I'll help you to find it.

617
00:50:02,884 --> 00:50:05,119
Please answer the questions I ask you.

618
00:50:05,153 --> 00:50:09,023
Gary ate sausages in Germany. Is that correct?

619
00:50:09,524 --> 00:50:13,461
Gary received a mission to look for Gerald in Trafalgar Square. Is that correct?

620
00:50:13,494 --> 00:50:16,965
-Gerald...Gerald... -Gerald. -Yes.

621
00:50:16,998 --> 00:50:19,901
Where did Gary board the Eurostar from?

622
00:50:19,968 --> 00:50:22,971
Eurostar... Family line...

623
00:50:23,004 --> 00:50:25,907
The one moving forward... Compartment number 1...

624
00:50:30,645 --> 00:50:32,780
What time in the afternoon did you depart?

625
00:50:33,548 --> 00:50:36,818
-Ah, that I can't confirm. -Then think of it to confirm.

626
00:50:36,851 --> 00:50:39,554
-It was from the hall... -Yes.

627
00:50:40,888 --> 00:50:45,059
After exiting from the place I drank a cappuccino.

628
00:50:45,727 --> 00:50:49,130
-It started to drizzle lightly. -Yes.

629
00:50:50,164 --> 00:50:54,635
-We're supposed to board the train at approximately 1:30pm. -Oh! 1:30pm?

630
00:50:55,770 --> 00:50:59,674
At that time it was also a little... Ah! I remember it now!

631
00:51:00,475 --> 00:51:03,578
When I saw the train ticket ant that time.

632
00:51:03,611 --> 00:51:07,815
I was thinking... Usually it is 2:30pm, or 3pm, or something like that.

633
00:51:07,882 --> 00:51:11,986
But why is it 2:03pm?

634
00:51:12,020 --> 00:51:15,857
-I wondered why it was 2:03... -Really?

635
00:51:15,890 --> 00:51:19,794
-This information is just great! -Now that I remember it.

636
00:51:19,827 --> 00:51:23,898
Why was it like that? If they want 2pm, put it as 2pm, If they want 1pm, put it as 1pm.

637
00:51:23,931 --> 00:51:27,135
-Why is it 2.03pm? -2pm.

638
00:51:27,168 --> 00:51:30,538
Ah, could it be 1 or 2 minutes?

639
00:51:44,752 --> 00:51:47,722
Where can it be?

640
00:52:08,876 --> 00:52:10,278
Found it!

641
00:52:18,019 --> 00:52:19,253
There are so many tapes.

642
00:52:19,287 --> 00:52:22,990
I really don't know which one it is exactly.

643
00:52:30,431 --> 00:52:32,900
-Frankfurt? -Sausage!

644
00:52:39,941 --> 00:52:44,112
This is Schweinshaxe.

645
00:52:45,713 --> 00:52:48,950
It's delicious!

646
00:53:09,370 --> 00:53:11,572
There's not much time left. How is it? Is there or is there not?

647
00:53:14,142 --> 00:53:15,710
Is there!Or is there not!

648
00:53:15,776 --> 00:53:17,879
What are you doing this?

649
00:53:17,912 --> 00:53:19,881
Who knows, they might give me a CG effect!

650
00:53:19,914 --> 00:53:24,152
Kwang Soo, what CG are you still making? We must find this quickly!

651
00:53:33,361 --> 00:53:36,297
Suk Jin hyung has been looking for a while but hasn't not found anything yet.

652
00:53:37,431 --> 00:53:40,201
Hyung, this side has been looked through.

653
00:53:43,871 --> 00:53:45,406
-Kwang Soo! -Yes hyung.

654
00:53:49,844 --> 00:53:52,246
That's why you...

655
00:53:57,018 --> 00:53:59,086
You clearly just passed it.

656
00:53:59,153 --> 00:54:01,022
But...

657
00:54:01,055 --> 00:54:03,224
You did not see anything.

658
00:54:03,291 --> 00:54:05,626
You just left the clue here.

659
00:54:05,660 --> 00:54:08,729
-Running there with you mouth wide open. -I was wrong.

660
00:54:08,763 --> 00:54:11,065
If you were alone, you wouldn't be able to accomplish anything.

661
00:54:11,098 --> 00:54:13,701
Kwang Soo, let's take a look.

662
00:54:13,734 --> 00:54:16,938
This is 100 percent...

663
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:23,177
Turn on the machine.

664
00:54:25,813 --> 00:54:27,415
Power.

665
00:54:31,018 --> 00:54:35,056
-Login. Password:38... -There's no time for this.

666
00:54:41,395 --> 00:54:46,334
Hey! Hey! Wanna die? Hey let go! Let go! Let go!

667
00:54:50,605 --> 00:54:53,274
-What is this? -It is a case of hair pulling.

668
00:55:00,581 --> 00:55:02,850
That could be the one.

669
00:55:03,851 --> 00:55:06,821
Turn on the machine. There's no time.

670
00:55:06,854 --> 00:55:11,726
-I'll give you 5 seconds. 5,4,3,4,1. -Ah hyung, why are you like this?

671
00:55:11,792 --> 00:55:15,296
If you were in a movie like this you would have died. It would have exploded!

672
00:55:22,136 --> 00:55:24,138
Are they all fakes?All of them.

673
00:55:25,239 --> 00:55:28,743
Those that can be seen are all not real. I 've gotten so many of them already.

674
00:55:28,776 --> 00:55:31,245
What do you know?

675
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:34,348
You would get into big trouble like this.

676
00:55:49,397 --> 00:55:51,532
Bingo. Bingo1

677
00:55:51,565 --> 00:55:55,836
Please!

678
00:55:57,371 --> 00:55:59,140
Oh? What is this?

679
00:56:05,179 --> 00:56:07,581
What is this?

680
00:56:09,650 --> 00:56:11,285
What is this?

681
00:56:11,319 --> 00:56:13,654
What kind of hint is this?

682
00:56:15,589 --> 00:56:16,891
Wait.

683
00:56:29,036 --> 00:56:30,905
Ah, so it's like this!

684
00:56:43,284 --> 00:56:44,985
Mr. Detective!

685
00:56:46,087 --> 00:56:47,755
-Shall we share? -Huh?

686
00:56:47,788 --> 00:56:48,456
Let's share.

687
00:56:48,456 --> 00:56:50,157
No no.

688
00:56:50,224 --> 00:56:52,393
-Hello. -Oh, ok.

689
00:56:52,426 --> 00:56:54,528
Hyung, I've solved all of them.

690
00:56:54,562 --> 00:56:56,464
Do you really know all of it? How do you know?

691
00:56:56,497 --> 00:57:00,634
-I guessed them all! One by one! -Hey! Then... Dong Hoon!

692
00:57:00,735 --> 00:57:03,003
You and I can go together!

693
00:57:04,538 --> 00:57:07,508
Dong Hoon... Do you have the last card?

694
00:57:07,541 --> 00:57:10,511
That hyung seems to have something decisive.

695
00:57:10,544 --> 00:57:11,545
Do you have the last card?

696
00:57:11,579 --> 00:57:12,446
What did you say?

697
00:57:12,513 --> 00:57:13,681
Last card.

698
00:57:13,714 --> 00:57:15,649
Last card? Why?

699
00:57:15,683 --> 00:57:17,551
Without it, you won't know the final location.

700
00:57:17,585 --> 00:57:19,453
-Don't tell me... -Hyung, do you have it?

701
00:57:19,487 --> 00:57:22,857
The last card, hyung do you have it? Let us see it, hyung.

702
00:57:22,923 --> 00:57:25,359
Don't be like that, take it out and let us have a look.

703
00:57:25,393 --> 00:57:29,363
Ah, If you again it with our card, we will get a word!

704
00:57:29,397 --> 00:57:32,733
It must be fitted with our card for it to work.

705
00:57:32,767 --> 00:57:35,069
Of course! That's exactly it!

706
00:57:35,136 --> 00:57:37,505
But the most important thing is we must work together.

707
00:57:37,538 --> 00:57:40,808
From what I see, even if the hint is not correct...

708
00:57:40,875 --> 00:57:45,312
Maybe we only need to know 5 and we'll be able to know the answer already.

709
00:57:46,580 --> 00:57:49,049
Kwang Soo, do you have 10000 won?

710
00:57:49,083 --> 00:57:51,652
Oh? Isn't that Gary?

711
00:57:53,454 --> 00:57:54,755
What's this?

712
00:57:54,789 --> 00:57:57,425
Hello. Hello.

713
00:57:57,458 --> 00:57:58,526
-Hey Kang Gary! -Hyung!

714
00:57:58,592 --> 00:58:00,795
What are you doing here?

715
00:58:00,828 --> 00:58:04,832
You are alone here. Do you know how cold it is outside?

716
00:58:04,865 --> 00:58:07,301
Hyung, please let me have my meal.

717
00:58:07,334 --> 00:58:09,603
-Soup... Let's share the meal.

718
00:58:09,637 --> 00:58:12,072
Why do you all keep chasing me like this?

719
00:58:12,173 --> 00:58:13,841
Gary, no...

720
00:58:13,874 --> 00:58:16,410
Hey! That enough!

721
00:58:16,444 --> 00:58:20,414
I'll tell you honestly, we just found this.

722
00:58:20,448 --> 00:58:24,318
-Let's solve it one by one. It seems like it should be placed here.

723
00:58:25,119 --> 00:58:26,921
Eh?What is this?

724
00:58:35,663 --> 00:58:38,966
Where did you go, your eyes are bloodshot.

725
00:58:39,033 --> 00:58:42,169
Can you guys all leave? I'm eating right now.

726
00:58:45,773 --> 00:58:49,109
-How many do you know,oppa? -Not many.

727
00:58:50,711 --> 00:58:52,947
How many do you know?

728
00:58:52,980 --> 00:58:55,616
I have nothing now. This is really a big issue.

729
00:58:57,017 --> 00:58:59,119
What is Sauerkraut?

730
00:58:59,153 --> 00:59:01,422
-What is that thing? -Sauerkraut?

731
00:59:01,455 --> 00:59:03,924
-This is really my first time hearing it. -Sauerkraut?

732
00:59:03,958 --> 00:59:06,660
-Kraut. -What is Sauerkraut?

733
00:59:06,694 --> 00:59:08,963
This is really my first time hearing it.

734
00:59:08,996 --> 00:59:11,565
Oppa, don't just write it down.

735
00:59:11,599 --> 00:59:13,634
How can you just write that down? It won't do!

736
00:59:13,667 --> 00:59:16,670
Why? Isn't this what you said, Sauerkraut?

737
00:59:17,404 --> 00:59:20,040
This is really my first time hearing it.

738
00:59:21,442 --> 00:59:23,744
Is it Germany?

739
00:59:23,777 --> 00:59:26,146
What is the meaning of that in German?

740
00:59:26,213 --> 00:59:28,749
Germany is really difficult.

741
00:59:42,596 --> 00:59:44,665
The only one I remember is this.

742
00:59:47,568 --> 00:59:49,737
3,3!

743
00:59:52,106 --> 00:59:53,941
Oh, yes Mong Ji?

744
00:59:56,210 --> 00:59:59,780
I couldn't remember this just now. This is 2:03pm.

745
01:00:03,017 --> 01:00:05,185
I think it is row 1.

746
01:00:13,227 --> 01:00:14,194
Hyung, don't run away!

747
01:00:14,228 --> 01:00:16,196
Let's walk together!

748
01:00:16,230 --> 01:00:19,833
Don't be like that. I already know.

749
01:00:31,712 --> 01:00:35,082
Ya! Really.

750
01:00:44,892 --> 01:00:47,161
Close the door,close the door.

751
01:00:51,899 --> 01:00:55,102
-Sorry, Suk Jin hyung! I have no choice. -And we love you.

752
01:01:04,578 --> 01:01:07,615
I knew it would be like that so I made a mark.

753
01:01:08,782 --> 01:01:11,251
There is always someone out there who is better!

754
01:01:17,224 --> 01:01:20,160
This is it.

755
01:01:21,929 --> 01:01:25,099
Wah, I'm never going to trust all of you again.

756
01:01:29,403 --> 01:01:33,040
Ji Hyo, let's look at it together.

757
01:01:33,941 --> 01:01:36,577
-Ji Hyo,Ji Hyo? -Yes.

758
01:01:37,244 --> 01:01:38,579
Let us see.

759
01:01:39,647 --> 01:01:43,017
If Jong Kook and the rest go first, we will be finished.

760
01:01:43,050 --> 01:01:43,884
He doesn't have this paper.

761
01:01:44,418 --> 01:01:45,886
What makes you think that there is only one?

762
01:01:45,919 --> 01:01:47,287
There is only one.

763
01:01:47,321 --> 01:01:48,555
-Really? -Yes.

764
01:01:48,555 --> 01:01:50,891
-There is another one. -See.

765
01:01:52,159 --> 01:01:55,062
Why are you keep doing that me! Keep quiet!

766
01:01:55,095 --> 01:01:57,064
Keep clam, put down your hand.

767
01:01:57,064 --> 01:01:58,799
They say that there is one more, they might have taken it.

768
01:01:58,832 --> 01:02:01,568
Oppa, we should hurry up.

769
01:02:01,602 --> 01:02:04,171
-Oppa! -Alright, alright.

770
01:02:04,204 --> 01:02:06,173
Oppa, it tore.

771
01:02:06,206 --> 01:02:09,843
Give it to me first! Let's put them on the table.

772
01:02:14,014 --> 01:02:17,418
-Sorry! -You are always like this.

773
01:02:17,484 --> 01:02:19,953
Last time you even bit me.

774
01:02:19,987 --> 01:02:22,122
You don't even get flustered.

775
01:02:22,156 --> 01:02:24,725
You did not even hesitate to retaliate when it got snatched!

776
01:02:24,758 --> 01:02:26,527
They're all locked, oppa.

777
01:02:26,560 --> 01:02:30,864
After I snatched it, she didn't look at me and look for the door instead.

778
01:02:31,265 --> 01:02:33,734
Oppa, I already know.

779
01:02:33,801 --> 01:02:36,236
-We have to open up the card first. -I know, oppa. Give it to me first.

780
01:02:37,471 --> 01:02:39,506
-What's going on? -It's Suk Jin oppa.

781
01:02:40,307 --> 01:02:41,875
Oh, it's Suk Jin hyung.

782
01:02:41,909 --> 01:02:45,345
-Hurry and take it out! -Hurry, hurry!

783
01:02:56,123 --> 01:02:58,525
You can't do it without me.

784
01:02:58,592 --> 01:03:01,729
-Why? -Can't do what?

785
01:03:01,762 --> 01:03:06,533
-You really cannot do without me! -Why?

786
01:03:07,367 --> 01:03:11,271
I...

787
01:03:11,305 --> 01:03:13,040
Have this?

788
01:03:23,584 --> 01:03:26,487
-We were talking... -Isn't there only one?

789
01:03:31,792 --> 01:03:34,928
There are many fake ones!

790
01:03:34,962 --> 01:03:37,164
Mine is real, real!

791
01:03:37,197 --> 01:03:40,267
Look, what is this?

792
01:03:40,801 --> 01:03:43,537
Which number of eucostar he take?

793
01:03:45,372 --> 01:03:46,173
Number 1, car number 1.

794
01:03:46,206 --> 01:03:48,275
I know this, hyung!

795
01:03:48,976 --> 01:03:51,211
Left at 2:03pm.

796
01:03:51,712 --> 01:03:56,049
That's no it. It does not matter anyway....

797
01:03:56,083 --> 01:03:59,153
That is 1,2,3.

798
01:03:59,186 --> 01:04:01,588
I have asked Gary oppa about this before.

799
01:04:01,655 --> 01:04:05,125
No. He might not know.

800
01:04:13,467 --> 01:04:16,503
It points to the exit.

801
01:04:16,537 --> 01:04:17,971
We have to go out?

802
01:04:18,005 --> 01:04:20,207
Good. 1,2.

803
01:04:20,874 --> 01:04:23,043
Is there none containing 't'?

804
01:04:23,110 --> 01:04:25,412
central park

805
01:05:06,687 --> 01:05:08,555
This is Schweinshaxe.

806
01:05:08,589 --> 01:05:11,725
Schweinshaxe, German style pig trotters.

807
01:05:36,783 --> 01:05:40,087
-What is this? -Newspaper that Europeans read.

808
01:05:40,120 --> 01:05:42,723
Ah, okay. I will read it well.

809
01:05:42,756 --> 01:05:45,659
I can recognize some words.

810
01:06:07,514 --> 01:06:09,449
Eurostar!

811
01:06:27,167 --> 01:06:30,304
I want three of this.

812
01:07:09,076 --> 01:07:10,844
What?

813
01:07:13,914 --> 01:07:16,450
Wait

814
01:07:16,516 --> 01:07:20,187
We should walk towards the central park.

815
01:07:35,369 --> 01:07:38,772
This is not it... Central... 123?

816
01:07:52,552 --> 01:07:55,489
-Central park, one place, two places. -There are three places. What to do?

817
01:07:55,522 --> 01:08:00,093
-They are near each other, right? -Hyung, hyung...

818
01:08:00,127 --> 01:08:05,132
Central. Central.... There is a road name...

819
01:08:31,024 --> 01:08:32,893
-Kwang Soo! -Yes hyung?!

820
01:08:32,926 --> 01:08:35,429
Go to central 123!

821
01:08:35,462 --> 01:08:40,000
Today we will show what we hyung and dongseang can do!

822
01:08:40,033 --> 01:08:44,638
-Our hyung! -My dongseang!

823
01:08:47,207 --> 01:08:49,910
Is that your car? -Uh, that one in front.

824
01:08:52,512 --> 01:08:55,916
What are we going there for? Are we searching?

825
01:08:55,949 --> 01:08:59,886
-Jong Kook hyung is already searching there. -Kim Jong Kook is also searching.

826
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:03,290
Don't we all have keys? It has something to do with the keys.

827
01:09:13,266 --> 01:09:15,135
Ah, this is really!

828
01:09:21,775 --> 01:09:22,876
Where? Looks like it is racing park.

829
01:09:25,445 --> 01:09:28,215
Are they car keys?

830
01:09:42,796 --> 01:09:45,699
Please. Is it not this?

831
01:09:51,605 --> 01:09:54,074
Seems like it's not this.

832
01:10:08,688 --> 01:10:11,291
All right, go play for awhile.

833
01:10:11,358 --> 01:10:13,827
Let me sleep for a little.

834
01:10:13,894 --> 01:10:17,764
This is a good place! I should have gone here before.

835
01:10:23,136 --> 01:10:24,471
Ji Hyo.

836
01:10:29,142 --> 01:10:33,113
Let oppa sleep for a while.

837
01:10:33,146 --> 01:10:35,549
I cannot live anymore, really.

838
01:10:37,384 --> 01:10:40,086
Is this the time to sleep? We need to look for the bag!

839
01:10:44,124 --> 01:10:46,359
Dong Hoon!

840
01:10:47,227 --> 01:10:49,529
It's here.

841
01:10:53,266 --> 01:10:54,334
Oh, hold on.

842
01:10:55,835 --> 01:10:56,803
This way.

843
01:11:17,157 --> 01:11:18,191
What's this?

844
01:11:21,728 --> 01:11:24,231
Dong Hoon, let's go there.

845
01:11:24,264 --> 01:11:26,032
What's that?

846
01:11:26,099 --> 01:11:28,068
It's a Pye Beak hall.

847
01:11:31,671 --> 01:11:33,540
It can't be here right?

848
01:11:35,175 --> 01:11:35,976
It seems right! What to do?

849
01:11:36,009 --> 01:11:37,277
We found it!

850
01:11:38,778 --> 01:11:40,413
-We found it! -There are two locks?

851
01:11:41,181 --> 01:11:43,183
So it's like that.

852
01:11:44,451 --> 01:11:45,385
Hyung!

853
01:11:45,418 --> 01:11:47,454
It's good we have two keys.

854
01:11:49,322 --> 01:11:51,791
Perhaps, it's yours and mine. That would be too coincidental, right?

855
01:11:51,825 --> 01:11:53,460
-Do you have a key? -Yes.

856
01:11:55,061 --> 01:11:57,030
But, isn't this an individual game?

857
01:11:57,897 --> 01:11:59,132
Oh, it works!

858
01:12:03,637 --> 01:12:05,405
What? Hyung's doesn't work?

859
01:12:05,438 --> 01:12:07,207
Oh!

860
01:12:07,240 --> 01:12:08,842
What? Hyung's doesn't work?

861
01:12:16,383 --> 01:12:18,818
There are different keys?

862
01:12:18,852 --> 01:12:20,720
Oh, this one works.

863
01:12:20,720 --> 01:12:22,289
This isn't it.

864
01:12:22,322 --> 01:12:24,057
It cannot be opened right?

865
01:12:26,760 --> 01:12:27,627
Doesn't work, right?

866
01:12:27,694 --> 01:12:30,263
Seems like someone else has the other key.

867
01:12:35,835 --> 01:12:37,203
What is this?

868
01:12:48,748 --> 01:12:51,184
There is no specific hint.

869
01:12:56,089 --> 01:12:57,691
I think my key can open it.

870
01:13:05,231 --> 01:13:07,567
-I will try it myself. -You try to open it.

871
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:10,804
Try opening it.

872
01:13:10,837 --> 01:13:12,906
Try this one.

873
01:13:20,146 --> 01:13:20,814
Open it.

874
01:13:25,251 --> 01:13:26,720
What about this?

875
01:13:33,326 --> 01:13:35,128
I told you not to do it.

876
01:13:49,776 --> 01:13:53,446
How frustrating. We have it right in front of us.

877
01:13:53,513 --> 01:13:55,515
How come it cannot be unlocked?

878
01:13:57,083 --> 01:13:59,919
So disappointing.

879
01:14:02,655 --> 01:14:03,790
Jae Suk hyung!

880
01:14:05,825 --> 01:14:06,726
What?

881
01:14:06,793 --> 01:14:08,194
I got it.

882
01:14:08,228 --> 01:14:09,662
What do you know?

883
01:14:09,696 --> 01:14:13,767
Lee Yoo Ji!

884
01:14:18,004 --> 01:14:20,340
-If you go to the 3rd floor and walk to the left, there's a treasure box. -Really?

885
01:14:20,373 --> 01:14:21,875
But you need two keys.

886
01:14:21,908 --> 01:14:25,278
-One of the locks can be opened by all the keys. -And so?

887
01:14:25,311 --> 01:14:27,947
But the other needs a different key.

888
01:14:32,852 --> 01:14:33,620
In Europe.

889
01:14:33,686 --> 01:14:35,822
Is there a place like this, in Europe?

890
01:14:35,855 --> 01:14:37,824
There is no such place in Europe.

891
01:14:39,492 --> 01:14:41,227
There seems to be something there.

892
01:14:44,597 --> 01:14:45,331
Hyung, we need to hurry before the others come.

893
01:14:48,468 --> 01:14:50,303
-Hyung, we're a team right? -Of course.

894
01:14:51,905 --> 01:14:53,807
It doesn't seem to be here. -What?

895
01:14:56,209 --> 01:14:59,779
Kim Joog Kook must be searching for the key now.

896
01:15:01,314 --> 01:15:03,817
How does he search so well?

897
01:15:04,284 --> 01:15:07,620
It should not be in these kind of places.

898
01:15:07,654 --> 01:15:10,089
Where is it hidden?

899
01:15:10,156 --> 01:15:12,058
Maybe we have to tear off name tags?

900
01:15:13,092 --> 01:15:13,993
No, it is not.

901
01:15:14,060 --> 01:15:16,362
-Why are you like that towards me? -Kwang Soo.

902
01:15:16,396 --> 01:15:18,231
Just curious if it's about tearing name tags.

903
01:15:26,139 --> 01:15:27,440
Gary knows?

904
01:15:29,476 --> 01:15:33,580
Gary knows.

905
01:15:51,631 --> 01:15:52,632
Therefore Ji Hyo...

906
01:15:55,235 --> 01:15:57,670
So I have to look for Kang Gary!

907
01:16:04,878 --> 01:16:07,313
Perhaps someone else has the key.

908
01:16:07,347 --> 01:16:10,450
-Is that so? -Maybe we should to snatch it away?

909
01:16:10,483 --> 01:16:13,319
-Kwang Soo, show me your key. -I already tried it.

910
01:16:13,353 --> 01:16:15,088
You cannot open it? Both of them?

911
01:16:19,225 --> 01:16:20,660
But there seems to be something there.

912
01:16:21,761 --> 01:16:23,696
The treasure that I lost.. Ah, why?

913
01:16:42,582 --> 01:16:44,450
Perhaps someone else has the key.

914
01:16:44,484 --> 01:16:47,654
-Is that so? -Maybe we should to snatch it away?

915
01:16:47,687 --> 01:16:50,757
-Kwang Soo, show me your key. -I already tried it.

916
01:16:50,790 --> 01:16:52,458
You cannot open it? Both of them?

917
01:16:56,208 --> 01:16:58,460
But there seems to be something there.

918
01:16:58,460 --> 01:17:01,234
The treasure that I lost.. Ah, why?

919
01:17:01,230 --> 01:17:03,530
Ah, why?

920
01:17:03,570 --> 01:17:06,606
Why are you like that? I am very tired.

921
01:17:10,443 --> 01:17:12,078
Gary hyung knows it?

922
01:17:22,121 --> 01:17:26,025
Hey, Lee Kwang Soo!

923
01:17:26,092 --> 01:17:28,194
What are you doing?

924
01:18:13,806 --> 01:18:16,909
What should I do?What should I do?

925
01:18:16,976 --> 01:18:19,812
Ji Hyo, why didn't you even move?

926
01:18:21,447 --> 01:18:23,349
That is mine, mine!

927
01:18:23,383 --> 01:18:25,051
I found it.

928
01:18:25,118 --> 01:18:27,420
How did I open it?

929
01:18:30,223 --> 01:18:32,458
Why is he giving this to me?

930
01:18:32,525 --> 01:18:36,696
-It is for you to bring it back to Korea safely. -For me to bring back to Korea safely?

931
01:18:36,696 --> 01:18:39,065
-A souvenir from France to be brought back. -For me?

932
01:18:41,034 --> 01:18:42,068
Mercl.

933
01:18:56,849 --> 01:18:59,504
-Did Gary hyung know about it? -I didn't know!

934
01:18:59,500 --> 01:19:01,250
If I knew I would...

935
01:19:01,250 --> 01:19:05,191
I am really very tried.
