1
00:00:11,395 --> 00:00:13,230
It's really daebak.

2
00:00:14,432 --> 00:00:16,067
A head on confrontation.

3
00:00:20,004 --> 00:00:22,239
Let's duke it out in one round, coolly.

4
00:00:22,239 --> 00:00:23,307
Guys, where are you?

5
00:00:23,607 --> 00:00:25,710
We don't have time to look at this. This is glass.

6
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:27,278
If we're caught it's all over.

7
00:00:27,278 --> 00:00:29,814
-This is a cruel place. -Where exactly are the real scratch cards?

8
00:00:29,814 --> 00:00:31,048
Have you seen Jiyong?

9
00:00:31,048 --> 00:00:33,050
Have you seen GD?

10
00:00:37,788 --> 00:00:39,190
Why did you tear mine off?

11
00:00:39,256 --> 00:00:40,458
You won't even let me listen, you won't let me talk.

12
00:00:40,458 --> 00:00:42,493
-I can't even go where I want to. -He tore mine off, Gwang Soo.

13
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:45,796
It's T.O.P! T.O.P. is running!

14
00:00:46,097 --> 00:00:47,932
Catch him!

15
00:00:48,232 --> 00:00:49,500
Running Man, manse!

16
00:00:52,136 --> 00:00:52,970
HaHa hyung...

17
00:00:58,642 --> 00:01:00,311
-Somehow I feel... -We were toyed with.

18
00:01:00,311 --> 00:01:02,313
Humiliated.

19
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:05,149
You've brought humiliation unto me.

20
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,902
Oh, we're first right?

21
00:01:26,337 --> 00:01:28,005
Just bring the flag in please.

22
00:01:28,039 --> 00:01:29,907
-Once you enter, you'll be given instructions. -Is this the place?

23
00:01:30,074 --> 00:01:30,608
What?

24
00:01:30,608 --> 00:01:32,276
We should have been hiding in this sort of building.

25
00:01:33,244 --> 00:01:34,011
It's so big.

26
00:01:38,949 --> 00:01:40,951
It's so big inside.

27
00:01:40,951 --> 00:01:41,986
We have to win this time.

28
00:01:49,026 --> 00:01:50,928
-Yes. -Please listen carefully.

29
00:01:51,896 --> 00:01:52,897
It's the second half.

30
00:01:53,431 --> 00:01:57,668
Because you defended in the first half, this time you'll be attaching.

31
00:01:58,602 --> 00:02:00,938
Similarly, you will put on bells and chase your opponents.

32
00:02:01,338 --> 00:02:03,707
The difference in the second half is that he'll give you walkie-talkies.

33
00:02:05,743 --> 00:02:08,245
The walkie-talkies can only he used amongst yourselves.

34
00:02:08,646 --> 00:02:10,848
But, the Defence Team will also have walkie-talkies.

35
00:02:10,848 --> 00:02:14,085
Because this is place is too big for attacking.

36
00:02:14,151 --> 00:02:16,554
Hey, I told you we should do it first.

37
00:02:17,555 --> 00:02:19,457
Starting from here on the first floor to the twelfth floor.

38
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:21,158
Can they all be used?

39
00:02:21,158 --> 00:02:22,626
You and your...

40
00:02:23,294 --> 00:02:25,029
-What do we do -This is really too big...

41
00:02:25,162 --> 00:02:28,365
-That's why we should I have attacked first. -Exactly. I was too careless.

42
00:02:28,766 --> 00:02:32,636
And if you see HaHa"hyung, you have to radio me.

43
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:33,804
Don't forget.

44
00:02:33,804 --> 00:02:35,673
-Why don't we go one floor at a time? -Did anything happen between you guys?

45
00:02:36,173 --> 00:02:38,576
- Firstly, firstly let's... - Huh? Well, earlier HaHa hyung...

46
00:02:39,877 --> 00:02:41,479
Toyed with me.

47
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,082
-Where's Jiyong, Ji Hyo? -Oppa!

48
00:02:45,082 --> 00:02:46,784
Where the heck did he go?

49
00:02:47,051 --> 00:02:48,452
Where is he?!

50
00:02:49,687 --> 00:02:50,988
-Jiyong. -Hyung!

51
00:02:51,055 --> 00:02:53,624
Have you seen GD, GD?

52
00:02:56,927 --> 00:02:58,229
He brought humiliation unto me.

53
00:02:58,429 --> 00:02:59,029
Also...

54
00:03:04,668 --> 00:03:05,736
Summoning by rings,

55
00:03:06,003 --> 00:03:11,342
If the team members wear the rings and shout out the incantation, one person from the opposing team can be summoned.

56
00:03:18,682 --> 00:03:20,484
What do we do with this?

57
00:03:39,203 --> 00:03:41,138
The rings look like the real deal.

58
00:03:41,672 --> 00:03:43,908
Firstly, let's wear the rings.

59
00:03:51,715 --> 00:03:53,450
These magical rings.

60
00:03:58,389 --> 00:03:59,390
Summoning?

61
00:04:00,257 --> 00:04:03,194
After we put these on... how to summon them?

62
00:04:07,164 --> 00:04:09,767
The power of the five rings will control space,

63
00:04:10,601 --> 00:04:11,769
Put the rings together,

64
00:04:11,769 --> 00:04:13,470
Put your hands with the rings together.

65
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:15,472
Call out each of your names.

66
00:04:15,839 --> 00:04:17,441
Call out your own names.

67
00:04:17,441 --> 00:04:22,179
If you memorize this incantation, you shout out the name of the person,

68
00:04:22,179 --> 00:04:26,250
For example, if you just call out Too Jae Suk' then the member you want will just appear in front of you.

69
00:04:27,551 --> 00:04:30,054
-However this can only be used on one person...? -Yes. only once,

70
00:04:31,488 --> 00:04:33,057
This has to be used well.

71
00:04:33,057 --> 00:04:35,059
Maybe, we should practice it?

72
00:04:35,059 --> 00:04:39,263
If you can't memorize this incantation accurately. the summons won't be activated either.

73
00:04:39,263 --> 00:04:40,998
Each of you shout out your name.

74
00:04:41,165 --> 00:04:41,865
Tae Yang.

75
00:04:42,266 --> 00:04:42,866
Seung Ri.

76
00:04:42,933 --> 00:04:43,801
Dae Sung.

77
00:04:43,801 --> 00:04:44,635
G-Dragon.

78
00:04:45,436 --> 00:04:46,136
T.O.P.

79
00:04:46,537 --> 00:04:49,940
The power of the five rings put together will control space.

80
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:50,541
Will control.

81
00:04:51,909 --> 00:04:52,776
1, 2, 3

82
00:04:52,776 --> 00:04:55,546
The power of the five rings put together will control space.

83
00:04:56,513 --> 00:04:57,548
Kim Jong Kook!

84
00:04:57,815 --> 00:04:58,949
Next we ll just surround him like this.

85
00:05:02,253 --> 00:05:04,788
If you do it like this now, the incantation won t work.

86
00:05:06,357 --> 00:05:08,259
-you have to do it properly. -Yes, I got it.

87
00:05:08,259 --> 00:05:10,261
-Everyone has to shout it out maturity tor it to work. -Ok!

88
00:05:11,462 --> 00:05:13,097
If you feel ashamed you don't have to use it.

89
00:05:14,665 --> 00:05:17,301
We're more ashamed after losing.

90
00:05:18,969 --> 00:05:19,570
Tae Yang.

91
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:20,871
Seung Ri.

92
00:05:21,105 --> 00:05:22,039
GD.

93
00:05:22,039 --> 00:05:22,840
Dae Sung.

94
00:05:22,906 --> 00:05:23,807
Top.

95
00:05:23,974 --> 00:05:26,944
The power of the five rings will control space.

96
00:05:27,044 --> 00:05:27,878
Yah!

97
00:05:38,389 --> 00:05:40,457
I didn't even do this sort of thing in elementary school.

98
00:05:40,524 --> 00:05:43,694
-if you feel ashamed you don't have to use it. -Okay!

99
00:05:43,861 --> 00:05:44,962
Dh, okay.

100
00:05:44,995 --> 00:05:46,230
We'll use it in a do-or-die stage.

101
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:48,465
-We can go, right? We can go? -Yes.

102
00:05:55,239 --> 00:05:57,007
-A friend, a friend -Stop it!

103
00:05:57,074 --> 00:05:58,275
I got it.

104
00:05:58,342 --> 00:05:59,877
We better get inside quickly.

105
00:06:02,012 --> 00:06:04,315
-Wow, bells. -Hey, there are walkie-talkies.

106
00:06:04,648 --> 00:06:06,183
-Hey! -Must you do that?

107
00:06:06,183 --> 00:06:08,185
There's no need.

108
00:06:08,585 --> 00:06:10,454
What are these? Authorization pads?

109
00:06:10,454 --> 00:06:12,356
-What is it? -Authorization pads?

110
00:06:12,356 --> 00:06:13,724
What is it?

111
00:06:15,159 --> 00:06:15,926
But aren't we being chased?

112
00:06:16,527 --> 00:06:18,595
Avoid the Attacking Team with bells and obtain 5 signatures!

113
00:06:18,996 --> 00:06:20,030
What did you say?

114
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:21,265
This is very difficult.

115
00:06:21,265 --> 00:06:22,900
How do we get this one by one?

116
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:25,302
-This can be brought along by everyone or conirmation. -And then?

117
00:06:25,869 --> 00:06:31,909
Find 5 person with these Running Man Paper and get their signatures with these pens.

118
00:06:32,409 --> 00:06:34,812
If you bring one back without this.

119
00:06:34,912 --> 00:06:39,283
Or if this paper isn't used, it's invalid. Even if it's already been signed.

120
00:06:39,283 --> 00:06:40,884
-Don't you want us to bring them back? -Inside .your pocket.

121
00:06:40,884 --> 00:06:41,652
Inside a pocket.

122
00:06:41,652 --> 00:06:44,688
-Hey, don't the people we're looking for have pens? -Hey, this is an authorization pen.

123
00:06:45,055 --> 00:06:47,157
Let's take the elevator up first.

124
00:06:47,791 --> 00:06:48,659
It's very flimsy right?

125
00:06:50,427 --> 00:06:53,397
-Hey, tear off Gwang Soo's before starting. -Hey, stop all the backstabbing.

126
00:06:57,968 --> 00:07:01,572
We will be giving a handicap to the Running Men who have extra members.

127
00:07:01,638 --> 00:07:02,773
Please choose two people.

128
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:05,109
-We will choose the Jong Kook hyung and... -Jong Kook and Ji Hyo are the best.

129
00:07:05,142 --> 00:07:05,976
-Okay. -No way.

130
00:07:05,976 --> 00:07:07,177
Gwang Soo hyung.

131
00:07:09,713 --> 00:07:11,749
-Ah no way! -The tiger, the tiger.

132
00:07:11,815 --> 00:07:12,950
Don't tremble.

133
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:15,886
-It's not like you're holding hands with a girl. Why are your hands trembling? -I'm uncomfortable.

134
00:07:16,253 --> 00:07:17,588
Guys.

135
00:07:17,788 --> 00:07:19,056
You haven't found them?

136
00:07:23,794 --> 00:07:25,729
Don't be like this.

137
00:07:29,933 --> 00:07:31,402
Not letting me listen, not letting me talk. Wang Soo.

138
00:07:31,402 --> 00:07:32,736
-Not even letting me go where I want to. -This guy tore mine off, Gwang Soo.

139
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:33,570
Really?!

140
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:37,708
-Tear off Gwang Soo's before starting. -Stop all the backstabbing.

141
00:07:38,542 --> 00:07:40,477
Jong Kook, start by tearing Gwang Soo's off.

142
00:07:40,477 --> 00:07:41,879
Oh hyung, I'll see how it goes.

143
00:07:42,346 --> 00:07:43,881
-I like us like this. -What?

144
00:07:45,716 --> 00:07:47,351
-It's weird. -So embarrassing.

145
00:07:47,484 --> 00:07:48,752
Two men.

146
00:07:48,752 --> 00:07:49,787
Let's go.

147
00:07:50,654 --> 00:07:52,556
Everyone, fighting. Fighting today.

148
00:07:52,689 --> 00:07:55,292
Thing like this aren't needed, 'fighting' doesn't have to be said.

149
00:08:04,535 --> 00:08:06,136
Authorization signatures.

150
00:08:06,303 --> 00:08:07,838
Would you have that authorization signature?

151
00:08:09,306 --> 00:08:10,274
Is it you?

152
00:08:12,443 --> 00:08:13,911
Please give me an autograph.

153
00:08:14,845 --> 00:08:17,881
Please give me your signature.

154
00:08:17,981 --> 00:08:19,983
You have to sign for me.

155
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:21,685
You're not the one with the authorization signature now, right?

156
00:08:21,685 --> 00:08:24,054
You don't have it right, the authorization pad?

157
00:08:24,388 --> 00:08:26,757
-You don't have it right? You don't? -I don't have it.

158
00:08:28,025 --> 00:08:29,927
You acted look like you do.

159
00:08:29,927 --> 00:08:32,930
-I was really surprised. I even thought you had. -Because I wanted your autograph.

160
00:08:37,901 --> 00:08:40,103
Hello. Please give me your authorization signature.

161
00:08:40,103 --> 00:08:41,872
-It's not me. -It's not?

162
00:08:41,872 --> 00:08:42,906
Yes. it's not me.

163
00:08:42,973 --> 00:08:44,374
You've worked hard.

164
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:47,911
-Please give me your authorization signature. -Okay.

165
00:08:50,547 --> 00:08:52,015
-On a memo pad... -Huh?

166
00:08:55,552 --> 00:08:57,187
Ah. I'm really...

167
00:09:04,094 --> 00:09:06,497
Hey, don't open the door so hastily.

168
00:09:07,164 --> 00:09:08,599
Can't you do it carefully?

169
00:09:08,599 --> 00:09:11,301
We have to be quiet now and you open the door so loudly like this, what do we do?

170
00:09:22,246 --> 00:09:23,580
There are bell sounds.

171
00:09:26,683 --> 00:09:28,085
Hyung, help me out with this.

172
00:09:31,455 --> 00:09:32,456
No, like this.

173
00:09:33,223 --> 00:09:34,892
I don't hear the sounds of bells.

174
00:09:36,226 --> 00:09:36,927
Hyung.

175
00:09:42,065 --> 00:09:45,202
You didn't confirm it and continued searching?

176
00:09:47,271 --> 00:09:49,439
-Hello. -Hello.

177
00:09:52,676 --> 00:09:54,978
I am going to look around for a bit.

178
00:09:55,379 --> 00:09:56,213
Okay.

179
00:10:17,801 --> 00:10:19,403
Ah! Found one on the 10th floor, found one on the 10th floor.

180
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:21,171
Excuse me.

181
00:10:21,405 --> 00:10:23,473
Is Manager Oh Se Min going somewhere?

182
00:10:25,909 --> 00:10:27,411
Ah, manager Oh Se Min!

183
00:10:28,345 --> 00:10:29,413
Manager Oh.

184
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,949
Please sign this for me.

185
00:10:33,483 --> 00:10:36,453
-You found the authorization pad? -Yes. Please give me your signature.

186
00:10:36,954 --> 00:10:38,255
How did you find this?

187
00:10:38,255 --> 00:10:40,257
We're experts in finding things.

188
00:10:41,024 --> 00:10:42,092
You really are an expert.

189
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:43,226
Thank you!

190
00:10:43,226 --> 00:10:45,262
-Ok I'll write my name. -Yes.

191
00:10:45,762 --> 00:10:47,230
-I'll sign it. -Ok.

192
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,836
Thank you so much Manager Oh. I wish you luck.

193
00:10:53,003 --> 00:10:54,137
Fighting!

194
00:10:55,539 --> 00:10:56,673
Work hard!

195
00:11:14,591 --> 00:11:17,094
They can be hiding somewhere in-a place like this.

196
00:11:18,228 --> 00:11:20,864
Aren't there too many places to hide though?

197
00:11:25,102 --> 00:11:26,403
Someone is there?

198
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:37,414
Wow there really are a lot of places to hide.

199
00:11:38,081 --> 00:11:39,383
There's a lot of places.

200
00:11:44,054 --> 00:11:45,555
HaHa hyung.

201
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:48,158
Just wait.

202
00:11:50,961 --> 00:11:53,230
You probably think that you let me go easily, but...

203
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:55,699
I really...

204
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:58,802
Felt humiliated.

205
00:12:01,304 --> 00:12:04,307
You've insulted me.

206
00:12:07,244 --> 00:12:09,012
Let's split into two.

207
00:12:09,012 --> 00:12:10,681
-Hyung! -What now?

208
00:12:10,781 --> 00:12:12,949
Hyung, this is the 1st floor isn't it?

209
00:12:13,283 --> 00:12:14,251
So...

210
00:12:14,451 --> 00:12:15,852
Let's split into two groups.

211
00:12:16,153 --> 00:12:17,354
-Thatls right! -With this part and...

212
00:12:17,754 --> 00:12:19,923
-Mission is 20% complete. -The other part...

213
00:12:20,157 --> 00:12:21,992
We have to hurry up.

214
00:12:22,059 --> 00:12:23,593
This is too hard, hyung!

215
00:12:25,162 --> 00:12:27,564
Mission is 20% complete!

216
00:12:41,845 --> 00:12:42,779
Right now...

217
00:12:45,549 --> 00:12:46,249
My heart is racing.

218
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:49,086
If the kids appear, don't try to escape.

219
00:12:49,086 --> 00:12:49,753
Then what?

220
00:12:49,986 --> 00:12:51,555
-What? -If I don't escape, then what should I do?

221
00:12:52,055 --> 00:12:53,790
I've never done anything but escape.

222
00:12:55,425 --> 00:12:57,194
-Please give us the authorization signature -Oh! Hello.

223
00:12:57,761 --> 00:12:59,529
-Please give us the authorization signature -Which authorization signature?

224
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:00,664
Ah, excuse us.

225
00:13:00,897 --> 00:13:02,699
That... you know that thing.

226
00:13:03,133 --> 00:13:04,201
What is it?

227
00:13:05,068 --> 00:13:06,570
We're on the same team.

228
00:13:13,009 --> 00:13:13,777
Spy, spy.

229
00:13:14,044 --> 00:13:15,779
We're on the same team.

230
00:13:16,546 --> 00:13:18,648
-Spy? -Aren't you?

231
00:13:18,648 --> 00:13:20,150
She really isn't a spy.

232
00:13:20,951 --> 00:13:22,686
-Doesn't look like she is. -Then... what are you doing?

233
00:13:23,253 --> 00:13:24,688
What are you saying!

234
00:13:24,955 --> 00:13:26,323
She's working!

235
00:13:26,656 --> 00:13:27,691
-Sorry. -Sorry.

236
00:13:27,924 --> 00:13:29,326
-Sorry. -Sorry.

237
00:13:29,359 --> 00:13:31,695
There should be one on this floor.

238
00:13:35,866 --> 00:13:37,300
Hello.

239
00:13:37,601 --> 00:13:40,036
Excuse us but we came to look for authorization pads.

240
00:13:40,604 --> 00:13:42,205
Sorry, no.

241
00:13:42,205 --> 00:13:43,740
Oh, okay.

242
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,475
It's not here.

243
00:13:46,543 --> 00:13:47,544
Close the door, close the door.

244
00:13:48,278 --> 00:13:50,280
If I come out then you should close the door immediately!

245
00:13:56,453 --> 00:13:57,454
Hyung Nim...

246
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:02,559
If you're going to suddenly stop then please say something.

247
00:14:02,826 --> 00:14:04,361
Please say something.

248
00:14:14,738 --> 00:14:15,605
Oh Gwang Soo!

249
00:14:16,506 --> 00:14:18,642
Gwang Soo, you...

250
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:23,980
He said TOP is on the third floor! 3rd floor TOP!

251
00:14:24,047 --> 00:14:25,982
-What? -The 3rd floor! 3rd floor!

252
00:14:26,183 --> 00:14:27,984
Suk Jin hyung is there, on the 3rd floor.

253
00:14:28,385 --> 00:14:29,953
Hyung, you can't go to the third floor!

254
00:14:31,955 --> 00:14:33,356
Hyung, where are you going?

255
00:14:33,356 --> 00:14:35,759
What happened to Ji Hyo?

256
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:37,460
Hyung, do this for me please.

257
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:39,196
-What type of hat... -Please snap this.

258
00:14:42,499 --> 00:14:45,101
-Are there one or two? -There are bells on the 10th floor!

259
00:14:47,103 --> 00:14:49,005
-10th floor. -10th floor, 10th floor!

260
00:14:49,873 --> 00:14:51,908
One person on the 10th, one person on the 3rd.

261
00:14:52,275 --> 00:14:53,677
They must be starting from the bottom and coming up.

262
00:14:53,677 --> 00:14:55,679
Ah, from below and above?

263
00:14:55,679 --> 00:14:56,713
Be careful.

264
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:58,448
This is so intricately done.

265
00:14:58,648 --> 00:15:00,450
-The last solution is.. -Be quiet!

266
00:15:02,385 --> 00:15:03,353
-Jong Kook. -Yeah?

267
00:15:03,353 --> 00:15:05,889
Look after him and treat him well.

268
00:15:08,425 --> 00:15:09,926
The last solution is...

269
00:15:11,027 --> 00:15:11,928
Fight fire with fire!

270
00:15:24,975 --> 00:15:26,109
Please give me the authorization pad.

271
00:15:26,209 --> 00:15:27,277
You're not it?

272
00:16:08,084 --> 00:16:10,086
He's coming, he's coming.

273
00:16:48,525 --> 00:16:50,894
Hurry up and find them.

274
00:16:56,766 --> 00:16:58,001
He was here for sure. Where did he go?

275
00:17:12,382 --> 00:17:13,383
Hello.

276
00:17:15,185 --> 00:17:16,653
It's okay if we look around, right?

277
00:17:17,554 --> 00:17:19,055
Because we're looking for some people.

278
00:17:19,923 --> 00:17:22,025
Could it be that you have seen the members?

279
00:17:23,159 --> 00:17:25,228
We've seen a lot, wandering around.

280
00:17:25,462 --> 00:17:26,196
Where?

281
00:17:33,403 --> 00:17:36,673
I'm on the 10th floor and I'm getting some tips.

282
00:17:49,052 --> 00:17:50,086
Hello.

283
00:17:51,154 --> 00:17:52,889
Perhaps, have you seen the Running Man members?

284
00:17:52,889 --> 00:17:54,324
I saw Yoo Jae Suk.

285
00:17:54,424 --> 00:17:56,126
Where?

286
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:58,895
-He's on this second floor? -I don't know.

287
00:18:28,091 --> 00:18:29,826
-7th floor. Why isn't it going. -It's going down.

288
00:18:30,126 --> 00:18:32,128
It's going down you say?

289
00:18:32,862 --> 00:18:34,664
It's harder if I go down.

290
00:18:35,565 --> 00:18:36,666
I'm in trouble.

291
00:19:04,794 --> 00:19:05,728
Tae Yang!

292
00:19:11,868 --> 00:19:15,138
Hold on!! Why did you guys come down?

293
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,641
Seriously.

294
00:19:18,641 --> 00:19:20,510
Hyung, this time...

295
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:25,815
Hold on!

296
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:28,785
Why'd you come to the elevator!

297
00:19:52,275 --> 00:19:54,611
Ah noona, ills okay, it's okay.

298
00:19:54,644 --> 00:19:55,245
I'm a spy. spy!

299
00:19:55,245 --> 00:19:56,613
Don't lie to me.

300
00:19:57,347 --> 00:19:59,682
How did you know I'm lying!

301
00:20:04,154 --> 00:20:05,755
Don't be scared.

302
00:20:06,856 --> 00:20:09,659
Noona, don't be scared.

303
00:20:13,096 --> 00:20:14,631
Ah, really!

304
00:20:29,112 --> 00:20:32,682
Song Ji Hyo noona is on the 7th floor.

305
00:21:15,959 --> 00:21:16,926
What are you doing here?

306
00:21:21,331 --> 00:21:23,399
We re doing well! Oh, we re so doing well!

307
00:21:23,666 --> 00:21:27,103
This! This feeling! This feeling!!

308
00:21:52,428 --> 00:21:54,464
I'm sorry, but can I have the authorization pad?

309
00:21:56,065 --> 00:21:57,934
Where is it? I think you have it.

310
00:22:01,704 --> 00:22:02,805
I'm sorry, but the authorization?

311
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:05,808
Are you looking for the authorization?

312
00:22:05,842 --> 00:22:06,909
Oh. oh!

313
00:22:09,545 --> 00:22:10,446
Reality?

314
00:22:16,185 --> 00:22:18,154
Hey! Everyone be quiet!

315
00:22:25,828 --> 00:22:29,399
I did it! I did it!

316
00:22:32,468 --> 00:22:34,504
Do I take all of this?

317
00:22:34,671 --> 00:22:35,538
Thank you.

318
00:22:36,406 --> 00:22:40,376
You were just sitting here quietly! I almost didn't ask you!

319
00:22:41,244 --> 00:22:42,812
Thank you. Please continue your work.

320
00:23:03,533 --> 00:23:06,703
This is so hard.

321
00:23:07,103 --> 00:23:09,572
Where is 6-Dragon?

322
00:23:10,173 --> 00:23:13,876
Everytime I see that, I think it's TOP and get scared to death, really.

323
00:23:23,486 --> 00:23:26,456
My legs aren't that different from his.

324
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:02,625
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

325
00:25:02,552 --> 00:25:04,253
Excuse, hello.

326
00:25:04,554 --> 00:25:05,988
May I ask for an authorization signature?

327
00:25:06,355 --> 00:25:07,423
Do you have the authorization pad?

328
00:25:08,458 --> 00:25:10,259
I don't have the authorization pad.

329
00:25:23,873 --> 00:25:25,541
Excuse me, I'm going to hide here!

330
00:25:32,782 --> 00:25:33,783
Hey hey hey hey.

00:25:50,399 --> 00:25:51,734
See you on the 1st floor.

334

Wait wait!

00:26:35,244 --> 00:26:36,646

00:26:37,513 --> 00:26:40,683
HaHa hyung. where are you? HaHa hyung, where are you?

00:27:11,647 --> 00:27:13,082
-Hyung, talk to them. -What?

342
00:27:13,115 --> 00:27:16,085
You said you would push them if they came. You said you would show me

343
00:27:16,185 --> 00:27:17,153
I can't.

344
00:27:18,354 --> 00:27:19,355
Wait wait wait.

00:27:23,626 --> 00:27:25,094
Call HaHa hyung fast.

00:27:25,161 --> 00:27:26,829
If he doesn't respond in 3 tries...

348
00:27:26,862 --> 00:27:28,531
Wait! I'll call him with my phone.

349
00:27:32,034 --> 00:27:35,972
You are really... really a horrible guy.

350
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:45,247
I think you're gonna have to surrender.

351
00:27:49,085 --> 00:27:51,153
If he doesn't pick up. I'm ripping it off.

352
00:27:51,253 --> 00:27:53,356
Wait, just a little bit.

353
00:27:56,459 --> 00:27:57,159
Dong Hoon hyung!

354
00:27:57,994 --> 00:27:58,761

355
00:27:59,028 --> 00:27:59,795
Where are you?

356
00:28:00,296 --> 00:28:03,099

Be quiet, be quiet.

365
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:30,960
Hyung. where are you?

366
00:28:32,061 --> 00:28:33,062
Hey, where are you?

00:28:33,129 --> 00:28:34,230
Hyung, where are you. where are you?

368
00:28:34,764 --> 00:28:37,099
I'm on the 10th floor. I think I'm going to go crazy right now.

369
00:28:40,870 --> 00:28:43,272
Say that since it's dangerous, you'll meet him on the 7th floor,

370
00:28:44,507 --> 00:28:49,045
Hyung! Since it's dangerous, let's meet on the 7th floor! 7th floor! 7th floor, there's no one there.

371
00:28:50,579 --> 00:28:51,013
Okay.

372
00:28:53,582 --> 00:28:55,484
-Okay, tear it off first. -7th floor! Gathering on the 7th floor!

373
00:28:55,484 --> 00:28:58,954
Yes, 7th floor. Then run to the 7th floor as you rip off his nametag.

374
00:28:59,055 --> 00:28:59,255
Huh?

375
00:28:59,855 --> 00:29:01,390
Wait, 7th floor! 7th floor.

376
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:06,095
Hyung! Why are you doing nothing?

377
00:29:06,962 --> 00:29:09,231
What are you doing, like a little girl?

378
00:29:09,231 --> 00:29:14,236
Since you're showing me your betrayal, I feel betrayed.

379
00:29:14,370 --> 00:29:20,209
Hyung, we should be together. Together.

380
00:29:20,876 --> 00:29:24,113
Wait, what are you doing, little by little? Wait, wait.

381
00:29:28,184 --> 00:29:29,585
Wait, wait! Don't do it! Don't do it!

382
00:29:29,985 --> 00:29:31,454
Wait, wait! Don't do it! Don't do it!

383
00:29:32,254 --> 00:29:34,590
No! Wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait.

384
00:29:53,175 --> 00:29:53,809
What is this?

385
00:29:56,312 --> 00:29:57,813
I'm out too.

00:30:00,449 --> 00:30:01,283
7th floor.

00:30:01,283 --> 00:30:02,985
Then you can go to the 7th floor.

388
00:30:03,552 --> 00:30:05,554
Wait, what about the 7th floor?

389
00:30:06,455 --> 00:30:07,723
He's at the 7th floor.

390
00:30:07,723 --> 00:30:08,724
Firstly...

391
00:30:08,724 --> 00:30:09,792
7th floor.

392
00:30:09,792 --> 00:30:10,593
Firstly...

393
00:30:10,593 --> 00:30:12,695
Hyung! Why are you doing nothing?

394
00:30:16,732 --> 00:30:18,934
I'm already out, the hand strap has been broken.

395
00:30:19,735 --> 00:30:22,071
-The hand strap is broken, so I am considered out -Lee Gwang Soo, out.

396
00:30:22,304 --> 00:30:23,839
-We are both out. -Lee Gwang Soo, out.

397
00:30:23,839 --> 00:30:24,874
We are really out already.

398
00:30:24,874 --> 00:30:27,843
Didn't they say once the hand strap is broken, we will be out?

399
00:30:27,843 --> 00:30:29,445
I just want to make sure.

400
00:30:46,595 --> 00:30:47,830
Hyung!

401
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:54,303
For old times' sake? What kind of old times!

402
00:31:17,159 --> 00:31:18,661
Have they gone?

403
00:31:25,734 --> 00:31:26,902
Thank you.

404
00:31:27,503 --> 00:31:29,038
Yes, please speak.

405
00:31:31,207 --> 00:31:32,141
Dae Sung?

406
00:31:32,141 --> 00:31:33,475
Thank you.

407
00:31:33,843 --> 00:31:35,678
Ok, I got it.

408
00:31:37,012 --> 00:31:38,080
Is it Dae Sung?

409
00:31:39,081 --> 00:31:41,183
It's an eatery called Dae Sung.

410
00:31:42,852 --> 00:31:44,286
I was shocked.

411
00:31:47,156 --> 00:31:48,524
I really was shocked.

412
00:31:48,691 --> 00:31:53,229
I thought you were acquainted with Big Bang's Dae Sung.

413
00:32:29,999 --> 00:32:31,867
Teacher, excuse me... Teacher...

414
00:32:31,867 --> 00:32:33,369
Really sorry.

415
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:36,438
Teacher, please excuse me.

416
00:33:13,042 --> 00:33:17,613
Oh... I smell something fishy.

417
00:33:19,748 --> 00:33:22,084
He should be somewhere around here.

418
00:33:24,153 --> 00:33:25,254
Oh?

419
00:33:25,254 --> 00:33:27,056
Let's see who is it in here now?

420
00:33:31,894 --> 00:33:34,263
He should be somewhere around here.

421
00:33:37,766 --> 00:33:40,803
Oh? Who's here.

422
00:33:53,482 --> 00:33:55,551
Teacher, where are you going?

423
00:33:56,885 --> 00:33:57,853
Tea... Teacher!

424
00:33:57,853 --> 00:33:59,955
Jiyong, HaHa hyung is under my feet.

425
00:34:00,255 --> 00:34:01,390
Where?

426
00:34:01,657 --> 00:34:02,858
10th floor.

427
00:34:10,065 --> 00:34:10,866
Aigoo.

428
00:34:10,866 --> 00:34:11,834
Please come out.

429
00:34:11,834 --> 00:34:13,702
Whether I hide or not, it's the same...

430
00:34:13,702 --> 00:34:16,472
Anyway it's a matter of time before I die.

431
00:34:17,773 --> 00:34:18,774
Tae Yang...

432
00:34:18,774 --> 00:34:21,577
Come to the 10th floor, quickly. 10th floor. HaHa hyung is here.

433
00:34:22,678 --> 00:34:23,912
Oh, I don't care already.

434
00:34:25,114 --> 00:34:27,750
How should we settle this? We're in difficult situation.

435
00:34:27,883 --> 00:34:28,984
Tae Yang.

436
00:34:32,454 --> 00:34:33,756
Wait, Tae Yang.

437
00:34:33,756 --> 00:34:35,090
I got it, I got it.

438
00:34:35,090 --> 00:34:36,425
Let's talk outside.

439
00:34:36,425 --> 00:34:37,459
-Ok. -Go out and talk.

440
00:34:37,459 --> 00:34:39,094
Ah! I really...

441
00:34:39,161 --> 00:34:42,698
This kid is really mischievous.

442
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:48,504
-I've caught hold of Dong Hoon hyung now. -Who is coming? Who is coming?

443
00:34:53,275 --> 00:34:55,844
At the 10th floor. At the 10th floor chasing him.

444
00:34:57,679 --> 00:34:59,381
Young Bae, where are you?

445
00:35:05,154 --> 00:35:06,555
Young Bae, where are you?

446
00:35:08,624 --> 00:35:09,892
You ran to the wrong side.

447
00:35:09,892 --> 00:35:13,562
Oh dear, your eyesight is really good.

448
00:35:13,762 --> 00:35:16,231
Oh dear, what should I do?

449
00:35:16,398 --> 00:35:19,368
Let's go out and talk, Tae Yang.

450
00:35:20,269 --> 00:35:21,170
Long time no see!

451
00:35:21,170 --> 00:35:23,005
Hyung, haven't you seen HaHa hyung?

452
00:35:23,305 --> 00:35:25,274
-Haven't you seen HaHa hyung? -That side! He went there!

453
00:35:25,274 --> 00:35:28,544
-Which side? -There. Really. I saw him!

454
00:35:29,711 --> 00:35:30,946
Where is Jiyong, Ji Hyo?

455
00:35:30,946 --> 00:35:31,580
Oppa.

456
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:33,115
Have you seen Jiyong?

457
00:35:33,115 --> 00:35:34,383
You didn't see him?

458
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:36,251
Did you see GD just now?

459
00:35:36,251 --> 00:35:38,754
-I saw him over on that side just now. -I've been looking for GD...

460
00:35:38,754 --> 00:35:39,354
Reality?

461
00:35:39,354 --> 00:35:41,023
-He was over there. -He was there?

462
00:35:41,023 --> 00:35:44,159
Jiyong, have you seen GD?

463
00:35:49,698 --> 00:35:51,633
HaHa is at-that side. Really. I saw him!

464
00:35:51,633 --> 00:35:52,668
He's there, really!

465
00:35:52,668 --> 00:35:55,337
-Hyung, I won't tear off your name tag. -Really?

466
00:35:55,337 --> 00:35:56,405
I will also not tear yours.

467
00:35:56,405 --> 00:35:58,607
-I will give you 3 chances. -Really?

468
00:35:58,974 --> 00:36:00,709
Why? Why suddenly?

469
00:36:00,709 --> 00:36:03,078
I saw him. I saw HaHa coming from that side.

470
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:05,781
He's just over there.

471
00:36:06,014 --> 00:36:08,684
-HaHa hyung ran over to that side? -Yes, that side. I saw him.

472
00:36:11,553 --> 00:36:13,088
What exactly should I do?

473
00:36:13,088 --> 00:36:14,990
What should I do?

474
00:36:20,095 --> 00:36:21,163
What should I do?

475
00:36:21,163 --> 00:36:23,031
Why did they let me go?

476
00:36:43,552 --> 00:36:44,753
Jiyong!

477
00:36:44,753 --> 00:36:46,388
Wait a while.

478
00:36:46,555 --> 00:36:49,358
Wait a while, GD.

479
00:36:49,358 --> 00:36:50,726
GD.

480
00:36:51,226 --> 00:36:54,163
Oh? You guys even have walkie talkies?

481
00:36:54,163 --> 00:36:56,064
GD, how do you all have walkie talkies?

482
00:36:56,098 --> 00:36:57,599
3rd floor.

483
00:36:58,534 --> 00:37:00,736
GD, don't be anxious first.

484
00:37:00,736 --> 00:37:01,603
Think about it.

485
00:37:01,603 --> 00:37:05,541
When we were competing in the afternoon and just now,

486
00:37:05,741 --> 00:37:08,744
There was once I really saw you but I pretended not to see.

487
00:37:08,744 --> 00:37:10,579
Just once, please, GD.

488
00:37:10,612 --> 00:37:11,780
Just once.

489
00:37:18,687 --> 00:37:20,656
By all rights, this is wrong.

490
00:37:20,656 --> 00:37:23,692
I got it, GD. I got it.

491
00:37:27,062 --> 00:37:29,031
TOP also came.

492
00:37:29,164 --> 00:37:32,801
Why are you all surrounding me like this?

493
00:37:35,037 --> 00:37:37,506
Why are you all always moving together?

494
00:37:37,506 --> 00:37:38,473
3rd floor, Jae Suk hyung.

495
00:37:38,473 --> 00:37:39,875
On the 3rd floor, Jae Suk hyung.

496
00:37:39,875 --> 00:37:43,912
Ok ok, 4th floor, Mr. Yoo Jae Suk is on the 4th floor.

497
00:37:44,846 --> 00:37:46,248
Where is Jae Suk hyung?

498
00:37:46,248 --> 00:37:47,249
3rd floor.

499
00:37:47,249 --> 00:37:48,684
I say, TOP...

500
00:37:49,084 --> 00:37:50,586
How many people have you all caught now?

501
00:37:52,854 --> 00:37:54,289
How many people have you all caught now?

502
00:37:54,856 --> 00:37:55,857
Hey, you!

503
00:37:57,893 --> 00:37:59,761
The VJ almost eliminated you!

504
00:38:00,262 --> 00:38:02,464
The path for him to pass is really too small.

505
00:38:02,464 --> 00:38:05,400
But where did you get so many walkie talkies?

506
00:38:07,402 --> 00:38:09,104
You really have many walkie talkies...

507
00:38:09,104 --> 00:38:11,540
After we catch someone, we release them if they give the walkie talkie.

508
00:38:11,573 --> 00:38:12,808
Ah, really?

509
00:38:13,108 --> 00:38:14,610
First, please hand it over.

510
00:38:14,610 --> 00:38:15,777
Erm, ok.

511
00:38:15,777 --> 00:38:17,813
- Then you are letting me go? - Please go.

512
00:38:18,714 --> 00:38:20,349
- Really? - Yes.

513
00:38:20,649 --> 00:38:22,050
- I can go? -Yes.

514
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:23,785
Is there anybody on the 3rd floor?

515
00:38:23,785 --> 00:38:25,254
Then I II go?

516
00:38:25,354 --> 00:38:26,955
Next time, you ail will...

517
00:38:28,490 --> 00:38:29,758
What's that for?

518
00:38:41,803 --> 00:38:43,505
5eungri Is there, Seung Ri!

519
00:39:02,324 --> 00:39:04,359
Please don't run!

520
00:39:04,359 --> 00:39:05,894
You will get hurt!

521
00:39:28,450 --> 00:39:30,285
Why did you press that button while running in?

522
00:39:30,285 --> 00:39:33,855
And you had to press that floor?

523
00:39:34,089 --> 00:39:36,825
Kwon Ryul! Why did you press that?

524
00:40:05,387 --> 00:40:06,755
You scared me.

525
00:40:10,459 --> 00:40:11,660
I almost died.

526
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:14,496
Hyung. we can't hide here. They're on the 2nd floor,

527
00:40:15,230 --> 00:40:18,400
Thank Kwon Ryeol, if he didn't press the 8th floor with his back, you wouldn't have gotten in.

528
00:40:20,268 --> 00:40:24,172
I only opened the door slightly, but I could hear your breathing.

529
00:40:24,172 --> 00:40:25,640
Do you know how much I've been chased?

530
00:40:27,075 --> 00:40:27,876
Let's get off the elevator first.

531
00:40:30,112 --> 00:40:31,346
I wasn't able to check here properly.

532
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:32,981
I'll go there.

533
00:40:35,684 --> 00:40:36,785
Can I get an authorization signature?

534
00:40:37,386 --> 00:40:37,986
You don't have it?

535
00:40:40,856 --> 00:40:41,723
Hang on...

536
00:40:45,427 --> 00:40:46,194
Approval, oh!

537
00:40:49,698 --> 00:40:51,767
Perform something for me!

538
00:40:51,767 --> 00:40:52,901
What?

539
00:40:53,802 --> 00:40:55,804
Show her something, quickly!

540
00:40:56,171 --> 00:40:57,639
Board dance? Yeah, board dance.

541
00:40:58,874 --> 00:40:59,841
Turn it turn it.

542
00:41:03,812 --> 00:41:04,613
This.

543
00:41:06,515 --> 00:41:07,215
Please sign it.

544
00:41:07,215 --> 00:41:08,884
All right. I'll sign it for you.

545
00:41:13,555 --> 00:41:16,491
We worked so hard just to get this signature?

546
00:41:16,491 --> 00:41:18,894
Mission 60% complete.

547
00:41:25,734 --> 00:41:28,136
Why isn't anyone looking for Suk Jin hyung?

548
00:41:40,215 --> 00:41:40,816
Oh?

549
00:41:46,855 --> 00:41:47,989
Bring him over calmly.

550
00:41:48,190 --> 00:41:49,858
G-Dragon. both our surnames start with Ji!

551
00:41:50,459 --> 00:41:51,526
My surname is Kwon.

552
00:41:53,195 --> 00:41:55,063
Go look for HaHa first.

553
00:41:55,063 --> 00:41:57,065
Mission 60% complete.

554
00:41:59,534 --> 00:42:00,302
Seems like I can t.

555
00:42:00,302 --> 00:42:01,203
Why?

556
00:42:11,847 --> 00:42:12,948
Where is the jail?

557
00:42:18,954 --> 00:42:20,388
Ji Suk Jin out!

558
00:42:23,458 --> 00:42:24,559
You're not even surprised.

559
00:42:28,830 --> 00:42:31,199
It's just that he's lasted a long time this time.

560
00:42:31,967 --> 00:42:34,135
I want to ask him later how he survived until now.

561
00:42:48,350 --> 00:42:51,853
Really, we haven't had a hide-and-seek bell race for so long.

562
00:42:52,587 --> 00:42:54,256
It feels like death.

563
00:43:11,273 --> 00:43:13,341
The Running Men didn't come this way?

564
00:43:13,341 --> 00:43:13,842
Sorry?

565
00:43:13,842 --> 00:43:14,843
Running Man.

566
00:43:51,146 --> 00:43:52,847
All right, let's go out.

567
00:43:52,847 --> 00:43:54,249
I look like a coward like this.

568
00:43:55,183 --> 00:43:56,785
I can just face him uprightly.

569
00:43:57,385 --> 00:44:00,455
Madam, I'm really thankful to you.

570
00:44:01,089 --> 00:44:02,390
That was too scary.

571
00:44:08,296 --> 00:44:10,265
Good work everyone.

572
00:44:10,632 --> 00:44:12,467
Sir. you don't have an approval sheet, do you?

573
00:44:14,970 --> 00:44:16,972
How about here? You don't?

574
00:44:16,972 --> 00:44:18,640
Authorization pad? You have it?!

575
00:44:20,175 --> 00:44:22,811
He really has It.

576
00:44:26,915 --> 00:44:27,716
Thank you.

577
00:44:29,184 --> 00:44:31,286
Mission 80% complete.

578
00:44:50,505 --> 00:44:51,940
We should use the rings now!

579
00:44:57,679 --> 00:44:59,147
Gather your rings.

580
00:44:59,147 --> 00:45:00,982
Shout your names.

581
00:45:00,982 --> 00:45:02,751
And then recite this spell.

582
00:45:02,751 --> 00:45:04,953
Then he'll appear in front of you.

583
00:45:04,953 --> 00:45:06,254
These magic rings.

584
00:45:07,989 --> 00:45:09,090
Who should we summon?

585
00:45:09,357 --> 00:45:10,191
Dong Hoon hyung.

586
00:45:11,026 --> 00:45:14,429
The remaining ones. are-HaHa hyung, Jae Suk hyung. Jong Kook hyung.

587
00:45:17,332 --> 00:45:18,033
Jae Suk hyung?

588
00:45:19,401 --> 00:45:20,402
Let's summon Jong Kook hyung, quickly.

589
00:45:21,936 --> 00:45:22,837
HaHa hyung!

590
00:45:24,606 --> 00:45:26,374
Don't summon HaHa hyung!

591
00:45:28,109 --> 00:45:29,210
I'm going to catch him personally.

592
00:45:42,490 --> 00:45:43,758
What?

593
00:45:53,868 --> 00:45:54,903
Please observe carefully.

594
00:45:55,937 --> 00:45:58,339
See how the person is brought here.

595
00:45:58,573 --> 00:46:00,308
Who's power it is.

596
00:46:01,843 --> 00:46:04,813
Who's power it is, please observe carefully,

597
00:46:15,223 --> 00:46:16,057
Tae Yang!

598
00:46:16,825 --> 00:46:17,826
GD!

599
00:46:20,729 --> 00:46:21,496
Dae Sung!

600
00:46:23,264 --> 00:46:23,832
Top!

601
00:46:24,232 --> 00:46:28,369
The strength of the five rings...

602
00:46:28,369 --> 00:46:30,038
Will control space!

603
00:46:30,038 --> 00:46:31,005
Yah!

604
00:46:38,346 --> 00:46:40,849
Summon Kim Jong Kook!

605
00:46:52,794 --> 00:46:53,828
Why are you dragging me away?

606
00:46:56,798 --> 00:46:57,699
Huh?

607
00:46:59,801 --> 00:47:00,902
What's going on?

608
00:47:02,036 --> 00:47:03,371
No I... hyung.

609
00:47:03,671 --> 00:47:06,508
No, why? Why are you...?

610
00:47:13,848 --> 00:47:14,983
No, why?

611
00:47:17,085 --> 00:47:19,754
What's this? Who controlled space?

612
00:47:20,855 --> 00:47:24,025
Sit down and don't move.

613
00:47:25,293 --> 00:47:26,327
Sit down.

614
00:47:26,461 --> 00:47:27,762
All right.

615
00:47:27,762 --> 00:47:28,930
Oh, it was true.

616
00:47:29,898 --> 00:47:31,132
They had superpowers.

617
00:47:32,567 --> 00:47:33,835
They really had superpowers.

618
00:47:34,769 --> 00:47:37,539
No, what is this? What's going on?

619
00:47:38,072 --> 00:47:39,841
There was a space controller? Here?

620
00:47:43,878 --> 00:47:44,879
What are you guys doing?

621
00:47:44,879 --> 00:47:47,182
You came because we summoned you.

622
00:47:47,282 --> 00:47:49,384
Hyung don't worry, it's nothing to be proud of.

623
00:47:49,384 --> 00:47:51,853
What is it? Let's hear it.

624
00:47:51,853 --> 00:47:53,087
I'm curious.

625
00:47:53,755 --> 00:47:56,324
-It's nothing to be proud of. -It's really embarrassing, isn't it?

626
00:47:56,791 --> 00:47:57,859
It's really embarrassing, isn't it?

627
00:47:58,793 --> 00:47:59,761
Dae Sung!

628
00:47:59,761 --> 00:48:00,395
Tae Yang!

629
00:48:00,728 --> 00:48:01,429
GD!

630
00:48:01,796 --> 00:48:02,397
Seung Ri!

631
00:48:03,531 --> 00:48:04,399
Top.

632
00:48:04,399 --> 00:48:08,336
The's trength of the five rings will control space! Yah!

633
00:48:08,736 --> 00:48:10,738
Kim Kook Jong! Summoned!

634
00:48:14,642 --> 00:48:16,778
I don't think I'd be able to use it, even if I had that. kind of power.

635
00:48:17,579 --> 00:48:18,947
You made us read it.

636
00:48:20,348 --> 00:48:21,416
Let's go.

637
00:48:27,055 --> 00:48:28,923
It was rather useless.

638
00:48:28,990 --> 00:48:29,824
You guys really...

639
00:48:29,824 --> 00:48:30,992
It was really fun.

640
00:48:31,860 --> 00:48:32,794
Ah, really!

641
00:48:33,161 --> 00:48:34,362
Go to the jail.

642
00:48:45,707 --> 00:48:47,008
Tell me why he got summoned,

643
00:48:47,609 --> 00:48:52,013
No, you have to tell me. Along Kook was talking to me and he suddenly got summoned.

644
00:48:52,013 --> 00:48:52,881
Would you like to hear the reason now?

645
00:48:52,881 --> 00:48:53,882
Yes.

646
00:48:55,383 --> 00:48:56,951
The five of them /line nog's.

647
00:48:56,951 --> 00:48:57,886
And?

648
00:48:58,286 --> 00:48:59,988
If they put on the rings...

649
00:49:02,123 --> 00:49:04,259
And recite the spell...

650
00:49:06,261 --> 00:49:07,528
That's enough.

651
00:49:08,296 --> 00:49:10,098
Hearing it is embarrassing enough.

652
00:49:11,266 --> 00:49:12,100
You did something similar before!

653
00:49:15,870 --> 00:49:17,972
The one who controls space!

654
00:49:32,387 --> 00:49:34,355
Kim Jong Kook Out!

655
00:49:37,191 --> 00:49:38,526
Oh! He's there!

656
00:49:40,128 --> 00:49:40,862
Over here!

657
00:49:42,330 --> 00:49:42,997
Hurry up!

658
00:49:51,506 --> 00:49:53,608
Jae Suk hyung is here, Jae Suk hyung is here!

659
00:50:00,615 --> 00:50:02,483
8th floor, Jae Suk hyung.

660
00:50:19,834 --> 00:50:21,402
Over here.

661
00:50:21,536 --> 00:50:23,404
Jae Suk hyung, I said I wouldn't just let you off a second time right?

662
00:50:24,005 --> 00:50:25,406
Hey, I thought it was an alien from outer space!

663
00:50:26,774 --> 00:50:28,443
Your green hair.

664
00:50:30,611 --> 00:50:31,846
Are they all caught?

665
00:50:32,347 --> 00:50:34,115
Ah, HaHa hyung is left?

666
00:50:36,284 --> 00:50:38,086
-Yoo Jae Suk. out! -What the...

667
00:50:38,286 --> 00:50:40,555
-Yoo Jae Suk. out! -What am I going to do?!

668
00:50:40,555 --> 00:50:42,623
They've all been caught. I have to hide.

669
00:50:43,891 --> 00:50:46,160
Hey, this isn't it. How do I do this?

670
00:50:46,894 --> 00:50:48,730
How am I supposed to do this alone?

671
00:51:12,754 --> 00:51:14,789
Hey, this is really crazy.

672
00:51:15,056 --> 00:51:16,357
Does this even make sense?

673
00:51:17,325 --> 00:51:19,160
It's just me left!

674
00:51:19,193 --> 00:51:21,529
I can t do it. how do I do it alone?

675
00:51:22,397 --> 00:51:23,865
1 just have to find one more right?

676
00:51:25,233 --> 00:51:28,136
Everyone, I'm sorry. I've unintentionally become the main character.

677
00:51:30,271 --> 00:51:34,509
You must, must hide well. I can see your head.

678
00:51:41,783 --> 00:51:44,085
What will Ha Dong Hoon do now?

679
00:51:44,085 --> 00:51:47,055
The walkie-talkie, Gary oppa's walkie-talkie was snatched away.

680
00:51:47,088 --> 00:51:48,589
Mine was snatched away too.

681
00:51:48,790 --> 00:51:49,791
Yours got snatched away too?

682
00:51:49,957 --> 00:51:51,793
I gave it to them to survive.

683
00:51:55,063 --> 00:51:56,164
-Gwang Soo? -Yes hyung?

684
00:51:56,197 --> 00:51:58,199
This is yours.

685
00:51:58,399 --> 00:51:59,500
You lost a screw.

686
00:52:01,269 --> 00:52:02,236
You lost a screw.

687
00:52:06,307 --> 00:52:08,176
It's a situational comedy!

688
00:52:08,176 --> 00:52:10,545
-Hey. twist in back in like this. -Ah, seriously.

689
00:52:10,545 --> 00:52:12,547
-Twist it? . Right. -You should have accepted it and twisted it in.

690
00:52:12,547 --> 00:52:14,615
Then wouldn't it be very interesting, this sort of situation comedy?

691
00:52:14,615 --> 00:52:16,651
The situation comedy's wrecked by you.

692
00:52:16,784 --> 00:52:19,287
-Hey, give that to me. -Do you know how difficult that... of course!

693
00:52:19,287 --> 00:52:21,055
-You being like this... -I need a character more now.

694
00:52:21,055 --> 00:52:23,391
-When hyung tells you your screw was loose you just have to twist it back in. -Hyung.

695
00:52:23,391 --> 00:52:26,427
-You shouldn't have given it to him, you should have given it over. I might as well have given it to Gary.

696
00:52:26,794 --> 00:52:28,429
The screw flew away.

697
00:52:28,429 --> 00:52:30,832
Gwang Soo. this was a pitch you had to accept.

698
00:52:30,965 --> 00:52:32,500
Ah, seriously. It's really...

699
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:34,535
It's a pity, right?

700
00:52:34,702 --> 00:52:37,171
-let me try? again... -He wants to try again...

701
00:52:37,872 --> 00:52:40,108
Ah, how funny it could have been, the screw falling out.

702
00:52:40,341 --> 00:52:41,776
Seriously, this...

703
00:52:42,610 --> 00:52:44,779
Hey, why did is this bracelet on the floor?

704
00:52:44,779 --> 00:52:45,913
Where?

705
00:52:46,981 --> 00:52:48,416
Gwang Soo went to a club.

706
00:52:49,817 --> 00:52:53,121
Actually, when Gwang Soo was grabbed earlier...

707
00:52:53,221 --> 00:52:54,856
-Hey, I thought you got rid of it. -Hyung was really amazing.

708
00:52:54,922 --> 00:52:56,057
The bracelet... you keep still!

709
00:52:56,057 --> 00:52:57,725
The bracelet was right around both our wrists.

710
00:52:57,792 --> 00:53:00,027
"Keep still". Again.

711
00:53:01,129 --> 00:53:03,097
What's this? Aigoo.

712
00:53:03,498 --> 00:53:06,934
Getting me to do things like tightening screws but not letting me talk.

713
00:53:08,703 --> 00:53:09,504
What am I?!

714
00:53:10,571 --> 00:53:12,240
Why is he so pitiful?

715
00:53:12,473 --> 00:53:14,642
Do I only have to do this sort of thing?

716
00:53:14,642 --> 00:53:16,644
I can also be funny with my talk hyung!

717
00:53:16,644 --> 00:53:20,081
Only doing things like Gwangvatar and Giraffe.

718
00:53:20,081 --> 00:53:22,617
-Gwang.Soo. -I also want to be funny with my talks.

719
00:53:23,885 --> 00:53:24,685
Just wait.

720
00:53:24,919 --> 00:53:26,687
Gwang Soo, it will come.

721
00:53:34,562 --> 00:53:36,664
If you run into HaHa hyung.

722
00:53:37,498 --> 00:53:39,033
Please let me rip off his nametag.

723
00:53:49,076 --> 00:53:51,145
Is there any, authorization signature here?

724
00:54:11,799 --> 00:54:12,600

725
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:14,969
9th floor! 9th floor! 9th floor!

726
00:54:18,239 --> 00:54:19,407

728
00:54:28,316 --> 00:54:31,586
Hey! Wait! Hold on! Hey, there's something.

729
00:54:35,189 --> 00:54:39,193
If you tear it off it will explode, bang!

730
00:54:39,860 --> 00:54:40,928
Bam, there it goes.

731
00:54:43,664 --> 00:54:44,632
Got it?

732
00:54:46,767 --> 00:54:48,002
Hyung!

733
00:54:57,645 --> 00:54:58,713
Then what do we do?

734
00:54:58,713 --> 00:55:00,715
We lost the mission and it's 1:1, right?

735
00:55:00,715 --> 00:55:02,183
-Ok, it's 1:1 no. -Yes.

736
00:55:02,283 --> 00:55:04,585
In awhile. the final battle will begin.

737
00:55:04,919 --> 00:55:05,820
A final battle.

738
00:55:05,987 --> 00:55:08,889
-How can it be done? All members will roll the dice. -Yes. and then?

739
00:55:09,223 --> 00:55:14,795
That per son with largest number will be the representative. Then face off to tear each other's nameiags.

740
00:55:14,795 --> 00:55:16,864
-It's one-on-one? -They'll do it one-on-one.

741
00:55:16,864 --> 00:55:18,866
-In this building? -Right. in this building.

742
00:55:18,866 --> 00:55:20,935
-They go up one at a time? -Hey.

743
00:55:22,203 --> 00:55:23,237
Then shall we start?

744
00:55:24,372 --> 00:55:27,475
Please be a low number.

745
00:55:30,344 --> 00:55:31,512
6, wow.

746
00:55:36,183 --> 00:55:37,418
Gary it is.

747
00:55:40,488 --> 00:55:41,722
Our Gae Yang.

748
00:55:48,996 --> 00:55:50,264
Gary and Gae Yang.

749
00:55:50,464 --> 00:55:52,266
We're both Gae Yangs!

750
00:55:58,472 --> 00:55:59,940
Tae Yang, I'll see you later.

751
00:56:07,915 --> 00:56:09,784
If it's a direct confrontation,

752
00:56:09,784 --> 00:56:12,153
seeing his athleticism in Running Man,

753
00:56:12,286 --> 00:56:13,354
is no joke.

754
00:56:13,954 --> 00:56:15,356
I have to find a good location.

755
00:56:16,724 --> 00:56:17,825
To ambush him.

756
00:56:20,227 --> 00:56:21,829
He's just too fast.

757
00:56:21,829 --> 00:56:24,665
I won't be able to chase him.

758
00:56:26,801 --> 00:56:29,003
Where's the fire exit...?

759
00:56:29,136 --> 00:56:31,238
I have no sense of direction.

760
00:56:31,672 --> 00:56:33,240
I was making a very cool speech...

761
00:57:14,782 --> 00:57:16,784
SUN!

762
00:57:17,985 --> 00:57:19,520
Sun!

763
00:57:22,289 --> 00:57:24,392
Seems like someone's calling me?

764
00:57:35,069 --> 00:57:36,070
Sun!

765
00:57:36,971 --> 00:57:37,772
Sun!

766
00:57:38,606 --> 00:57:39,774
Sunnnn!

767
00:57:40,274 --> 00:57:41,041
Sun!

768
00:57:41,876 --> 00:57:42,743
Hey, why is he so fast?

769
00:57:42,843 --> 00:57:43,944
Sun!

770
00:57:44,612 --> 00:57:45,913
-Oh! -Oh?

771
00:57:46,180 --> 00:57:47,581
Seems like they met, seems like they met.

772
00:57:47,615 --> 00:57:49,216
I can hear them.

773
00:57:50,684 --> 00:57:51,485
Sun!

774
00:57:51,619 --> 00:57:53,554
Why are you so fast?

775
00:57:53,687 --> 00:57:55,189
Where did he go?

776
00:57:57,792 --> 00:57:59,226
-What the...?! -Hey!

777
00:57:59,226 --> 00:58:00,394
Sun. Sun!

778
00:58:00,828 --> 00:58:02,396
Sun! Hey!

779
00:58:02,396 --> 00:58:03,164
Hey!

780
00:58:03,831 --> 00:58:05,166
Sun!

781
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:08,068
What's going on?

782
00:58:08,302 --> 00:58:10,538
It can t be that he won right?

783
00:58:20,781 --> 00:58:23,083
He's vanished, he's vanished.

784
00:58:26,454 --> 00:58:27,688
He's gone.

785
00:58:27,721 --> 00:58:29,690
Ah, I clearly followed him here.

786
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:31,552
How can he be so fast?

787
00:59:04,391 --> 00:59:05,359
He's gone.

788
00:59:05,726 --> 00:59:06,927
Ah, I clearly followed him here.

789
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:09,136
How can he be so fast?

790
00:59:51,405 --> 00:59:51,972
Wow.

791
00:59:52,206 --> 00:59:53,541
This is really...

792
00:59:55,142 --> 00:59:56,310
Acknowledged, acknowledged.

793
00:59:57,044 --> 00:59:58,946
He's truly my dongsaeng.

794
01:00:05,252 --> 01:00:06,353
For the winning team.

795
01:00:06,353 --> 01:00:09,557
Everyone will be given a set of specially designed apparel.

796
01:00:09,823 --> 01:00:12,393
-Because were at a fashion company. -Where?

797
01:00:13,827 --> 01:00:15,462
Aigoo, they're so cool.

798
01:00:15,629 --> 01:00:17,431
- Are you giving these as presents too? - Yes.

799
01:00:19,166 --> 01:00:21,535
-It's not for this side, it's for that... Yes -That's correct.

800
01:00:22,436 --> 01:00:24,538
-For the game today. -Yes.

801
01:00:25,306 --> 01:00:29,977
We designed special nametags.

802
01:00:29,977 --> 01:00:32,646
-What does it look like, can we take a look? -Ah. we... then...

803
01:00:36,083 --> 01:00:38,852
-We need these. -This is what we need.

804
01:00:38,852 --> 01:00:40,387
Hey, G-Dragon.

805
01:00:40,688 --> 01:00:43,357
If I knew they were giving these things my desire to win would be ignited.

806
01:00:43,357 --> 01:00:45,359
-Let everyone take a look. -They're rather cool.

807
01:00:45,359 --> 01:00:47,361
Ah, it matches them.

808
01:00:48,662 --> 01:00:49,563
Thank you.

809
01:00:50,130 --> 01:00:52,333
Hey, Tae Yang always raises his fists no matter what he does.

810
01:00:52,333 --> 01:00:54,335
This is cool!

811
01:00:54,468 --> 01:01:01,775
Ok let's, thank the design company again for providing a venue for Big Bang.

812
01:01:01,775 --> 01:01:03,777
Let's give them a round of applause.
