1
00:00:12,363 --> 00:00:15,433
We're wearing school uniform today. Hey, Ji Hyo's very pretty.

2
00:00:15,433 --> 00:00:17,835
-Hey she looks like Sherlock Holmes. -actually this is..

3
00:00:17,868 --> 00:00:20,638
The hand phone sticking out slightly like this is the highlight.

4
00:00:20,671 --> 00:00:23,441
Nowadays, do kids wear them like this?

5
00:00:23,474 --> 00:00:25,977
Oppa, kids nowadays, their skirt come right up to here

6
00:00:25,977 --> 00:00:26,711
is that so?

7
00:00:26,744 --> 00:00:27,712
Hey you were also like that

8
00:00:27,712 --> 00:00:30,982
-no our skirt were.. -Jeez Ji Hyo's..

9
00:00:31,015 --> 00:00:33,184
On the internet, that photo.

10
00:00:33,217 --> 00:00:36,020
That photo with the sesame leaf hair.

11
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:37,822
-your skirt was still like this. -that's right

12
00:00:37,855 --> 00:00:40,291
well today, who is coming today?

13
00:00:40,324 --> 00:00:42,626
-Isn't today spring? -yes yes

14
00:00:42,626 --> 00:00:46,797
so to usher in spring, we've prepared a Couple Race.

15
00:00:46,831 --> 00:00:48,632
-It's been a long time. -see there?

16
00:00:48,632 --> 00:00:50,034
Oh there are flowers

17
00:00:50,067 --> 00:00:54,405
-wasn't it like that last time? -We also wore school uniform the last time.

18
00:00:54,438 --> 00:00:56,474
If today's a paired Couple's Race, well this is..

19
00:00:56,507 --> 00:00:59,877
-I'm anticipating it. -we'll be in chaos today

20
00:00:59,877 --> 00:01:02,880
I'm definitely going for a date today, really.

21
00:01:02,913 --> 00:01:04,982
-I'll let you see a meeting in variety followed by marriage. -It's already a year.

22
00:01:04,982 --> 00:01:09,820
Well, our Suzy.

23
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:11,622
-Sulli Sulli -They should be returning actually.

24
00:01:11,622 --> 00:01:13,257
-Then let's wait a little more for Sulli -Yoona.

25
00:01:13,257 --> 00:01:14,892
-Suzy. -They should be wanting to come.

26
00:01:14,925 --> 00:01:16,460
Luna and Suzy

27
00:01:16,494 --> 00:01:18,629
I'm seriously going crazy, seriously.

28
00:01:18,662 --> 00:01:22,700
Now the guests will come out passing through that floral door one at a time.

29
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:25,870
-shout for the guests to come out together and they'll come out one at a time. -I got it.

30
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:29,707
-Everyone! Come on out! -I love you. I love you.

31
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:32,943
-Miss A. It’s Miss A. -Oh it’s Miss A.

32
00:01:32,977 --> 00:01:35,880
-Miss A, who? -Fei, Fei.

33
00:01:35,913 --> 00:01:37,581
Who?

34
00:01:37,581 --> 00:01:39,350
Wow, oh.

35
00:01:47,758 --> 00:01:49,627
Wow, oh.

36
00:01:54,632 --> 00:01:56,467
Yay... Oh?

37
00:02:03,574 --> 00:02:06,577
-what are you doing? -It’s Miss A’s song, why is that hyung coming out?

38
00:02:06,577 --> 00:02:08,679
So that music is then...

39
00:02:08,679 --> 00:02:11,282
But what’s this?

40
00:02:11,282 --> 00:02:13,884
Hyung. That’s what we’re saying.

41
00:02:13,918 --> 00:02:18,622
-oh why are you here, hyung? -how can a hyung come out from a floral door?

42
00:02:18,622 --> 00:02:20,458
Does that look like just a floral door?

43
00:02:20,491 --> 00:02:22,660
Hyung, it was Miss A’s song, why did hyung come out?

44
00:02:22,693 --> 00:02:24,662
It should be "Rustic Period" song. -No no.

45
00:02:24,695 --> 00:02:28,065
That song was played but why are you guys here?

46
00:02:28,099 --> 00:02:29,433
Why is hyung here today?

47
00:02:29,467 --> 00:02:30,768
Our program’s concept has changed.

48
00:02:30,768 --> 00:02:33,170
Won’t you get away from me?

49
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:35,339
Aigoo, why are you getting angry, the moment you’re here, hyung?

50
00:02:35,339 --> 00:02:38,275
You made me angry!

51
00:02:38,309 --> 00:02:41,512
If you saw us earlier, you would understand.

52
00:02:41,545 --> 00:02:43,714
Hyung, he’s a dud.

53
00:02:43,714 --> 00:02:45,516
Then, firstly...

54
00:02:45,549 --> 00:02:48,052
-Joon Gyu hyung -wow!

55
00:02:48,052 --> 00:02:49,687
Hyung we’re sorry.

56
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:53,190
We greatly welcome you.

57
00:02:53,224 --> 00:02:56,093
But because they played miss A’s song, we thought it was miss A.

58
00:02:56,127 --> 00:02:58,896
We expected it to be Suzy. -Jeez, it couldn’t be.

59
00:02:58,896 --> 00:03:01,165
-ok, Joon Gyu hyung’s here. -Joon Gyu hyung, nice to meet you.

60
00:03:01,198 --> 00:03:04,135
Ok our next person, please come out.

61
00:03:06,137 --> 00:03:08,906
Oh!

62
00:03:08,906 --> 00:03:10,341
KARA, KARA.

63
00:03:10,574 --> 00:03:13,511
Seungyeon, Seungyeon.

64
00:03:13,544 --> 00:03:17,148
-Goo Hara! -Seungyeon.

65
00:03:17,181 --> 00:03:19,617
-Goo Hara! -Seungyeon

66
00:03:31,562 --> 00:03:37,234
-it’s scary, suddenly. -what the?

67
00:03:37,234 --> 00:03:38,702
But why is the response so bad?

68
00:03:38,702 --> 00:03:42,673
-No it’s not bad. -it’s my first appearance today.

69
00:03:42,706 --> 00:03:45,509
-Hyung. -Nice to meet you.

70
00:03:45,543 --> 00:03:47,711
Why are you wearing safety goggles?

71
00:03:47,745 --> 00:03:49,780
-the back of your hat seems to be torn. -Hello.

72
00:03:49,813 --> 00:03:52,016
-Are the two of two friends? -Yes we’re old friends.

73
00:03:52,049 --> 00:03:52,983
Really?

74
00:03:53,017 --> 00:03:55,052
When we were in high school...

75
00:03:55,052 --> 00:03:56,720
-We took Line 4 together. -Together.

76
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,389
Is that so?

77
00:03:58,422 --> 00:04:01,892
We went to Haehwa-dong together, that line.

78
00:04:01,926 --> 00:04:04,161
Why are you suddenly doing this to us?

79
00:04:04,161 --> 00:04:06,363
You’ve been treating us well in the past, why is it like that?

80
00:04:06,363 --> 00:04:08,365
-Exactly. -There’s still one last person.

81
00:04:08,399 --> 00:04:11,001
There’s hope. Ok don’t lose hope!

82
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:12,336
-don’t give up! -ok now, finally!

83
00:04:12,336 --> 00:04:14,705
-the production crew won’t let us down! -they won’t!

84
00:04:14,738 --> 00:04:15,739
This can’t be it.

85
00:04:15,739 --> 00:04:19,777
Ok applause!

86
00:04:19,777 --> 00:04:21,078
Ok now, we..now..

87
00:04:21,111 --> 00:04:22,546
Seriously

88
00:04:24,215 --> 00:04:27,685
-oh. SNSD! -that’s right.

89
00:04:27,718 --> 00:04:28,452
-Taeyeon! -Just one.

90
00:04:28,485 --> 00:04:30,854
At least one person should come, just one.

91
00:04:30,854 --> 00:04:32,022
Ok who is it?

92
00:04:32,056 --> 00:04:33,157
Ok!

93
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,692
Please come out.

94
00:04:34,692 --> 00:04:36,327
Taeyeon!

95
00:04:57,114 --> 00:05:01,585
-wow daebak. -Daebak!

96
00:05:01,619 --> 00:05:04,321
Daebak.

97
00:05:04,321 --> 00:05:05,823
Hang on hang on.

98
00:05:05,856 --> 00:05:08,826
Nice to meet you.

99
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:17,101
Aigoo, aigoo.

100
00:05:17,134 --> 00:05:19,003
Why are you here?

101
00:05:20,271 --> 00:05:21,338
Oh you’re so pretty.

102
00:05:21,338 --> 00:05:23,507
Oh nice.

103
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:26,810
Oh you’re so tall.

104
00:05:28,012 --> 00:05:31,749
It’s like the boss of a large company is here.

105
00:05:31,782 --> 00:05:33,017
The head, the head.

106
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:38,489
I should come as a school principal, but I’m wearing a school uniform.

107
00:05:38,522 --> 00:05:40,824
Please greet everyone...’Hello’.

108
00:05:40,858 --> 00:05:44,962
Oh nice to meet you.

109
00:05:44,995 --> 00:05:48,032
I’m 60 years old.

110
00:05:48,065 --> 00:05:51,935
I don’t know why I’m on Running Man.

111
00:05:51,969 --> 00:05:56,373
So there are no more guests?

112
00:05:56,407 --> 00:05:58,208
Thank you very much.

113
00:05:58,242 --> 00:06:00,311
But why did hey give me a hat?

114
00:06:02,179 --> 00:06:03,113
What are you doing?

115
00:06:03,147 --> 00:06:06,950
-why did you give him a hat? -Isn’t he already wearing a hat?

116
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:10,854
You want me to wear two hats?

117
00:06:10,854 --> 00:06:14,291
Are you making fun of me?

118
00:06:14,325 --> 00:06:16,527
Wearing two hats.

119
00:06:16,527 --> 00:06:19,897
Wearing one fur hat is enough.

120
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:23,200
I agonized because of that!

121
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,903
He plays soccer a lot but when he plays soccer, he’ll wear a cap.

122
00:06:25,903 --> 00:06:28,405
-of course. -That lightning header shot?

123
00:06:28,405 --> 00:06:33,544
Take it off, hit it and put it on before landing on the ground.

124
00:06:33,544 --> 00:06:35,045
The people...

125
00:06:35,045 --> 00:06:37,348
They all feel that something is weird.

126
00:06:37,348 --> 00:06:42,319
Because things are restored immediately, they can’t laugh.

127
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:45,022
I’m sorry, how are your ages ranked?

128
00:06:45,022 --> 00:06:46,824
-He is the eldest hyung. -then he is next.

129
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:50,294
-Then next.. -You’re the maknae?

130
00:06:50,327 --> 00:06:52,129
-Really? -Hyung’s the maknae?

131
00:06:52,162 --> 00:06:53,030
You’re the maknae?

132
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:55,833
I’m the maknae. Isn’t Suk Jin the eldest here?

133
00:06:55,833 --> 00:06:57,201
So what about you and Suk Jin hyung?

134
00:06:57,234 --> 00:06:58,369
-They’re friends. -we’re friends.

135
00:06:58,369 --> 00:07:01,171
-How many times do I have to say it? -You don’t listen to people!

136
00:07:01,171 --> 00:07:04,274
Why do you get angry after talking?

137
00:07:04,274 --> 00:07:05,676
-Didn’t I say it already? -You make everyone scared.

138
00:07:05,709 --> 00:07:08,078
Inside these two hyungs..

139
00:07:08,112 --> 00:07:10,681
-Anger. -They’re always filled with anger.

140
00:07:10,681 --> 00:07:11,482
It makes one uncomfortable.

141
00:07:11,515 --> 00:07:13,450
But your uniform are so cool.

142
00:07:13,484 --> 00:07:14,885
There are the current uniforms.

143
00:07:14,918 --> 00:07:16,720
Miss Ji Hyo looks very pretty.

144
00:07:16,754 --> 00:07:18,188
Girl’s uniform.

145
00:07:18,222 --> 00:07:21,091
Give us something like that, what’s this?

146
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:22,326
I want that too.

147
00:07:25,429 --> 00:07:28,198
If I wear that I could be pretty too.

148
00:07:28,499 --> 00:07:32,903
We have the three of them today, are we racing with the three?

149
00:07:32,936 --> 00:07:36,373
Yes, just like we said earlier, it’s a Couple Race today.

150
00:07:36,407 --> 00:07:37,307
-yes yes. -yes couples

151
00:07:37,307 --> 00:07:39,610
-we’ll decide on the couples first. -yes.

152
00:07:39,643 --> 00:07:42,646
Also, this side has three people, so there aren’t enough people.

153
00:07:42,646 --> 00:07:45,115
-yes -From this side, err...

154
00:07:45,115 --> 00:07:48,919
-the two people of similar age to them will come to that side. -Suk Jin, come here.

155
00:07:48,952 --> 00:07:53,157
-Yoon Jae Suk, Ji Suk Jin, come here. -hyung looks very weird in this school uniform.

156
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:54,992
When I go there I’ll totally be..

157
00:07:55,025 --> 00:07:55,959
-come here. -I’m young.

158
00:07:55,959 --> 00:07:58,295
-I’m like a newborn baby if I come here. -Come here.

159
00:07:58,328 --> 00:08:00,230
-Hyung’s totally like an idol there. -Wow, seriously.

160
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:01,732
Hey, I look younger too right?

161
00:08:01,765 --> 00:08:02,733
-yes hyung. -You look young.

162
00:08:02,766 --> 00:08:07,304
-ok, we’ll proceed according to age so Mr Lee Deok Hwa will begin the selections. -Is that Si?

163
00:08:07,337 --> 00:08:10,340
The person chosen can refuse.

164
00:08:10,374 --> 00:08:12,709
-refuse us? -ah we can refuse?

165
00:08:12,709 --> 00:08:16,647
-if you’re unwilling to be partners until the end of the day.. -Jeez, it couldn't be.

166
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,348
Just say, "Ahjusshi, I’m sorry."

167
00:08:18,382 --> 00:08:21,852
-What’s Ahjusshi? -Jeez!

168
00:08:21,885 --> 00:08:23,754
-wow what’s that? -we should say ‘hyungnim’.

169
00:08:23,787 --> 00:08:24,988
Hyungnim, hyungnim...

170
00:08:25,022 --> 00:08:26,723
It’s fair and good..

171
00:08:26,757 --> 00:08:31,161
-I’m sorry. -they can just comfortably refuse us.

172
00:08:31,161 --> 00:08:35,499
But the rest of their filming careers may be rather tough.

173
00:08:35,499 --> 00:08:38,001
After they say, "I’m really sorry hyung"..

174
00:08:38,001 --> 00:08:43,240
Then, what are you going to do with my wounded pride?

175
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,509
Ok now, we’ll be choosing.

176
00:08:45,542 --> 00:08:48,011
Haha, I like his mother.

177
00:08:48,045 --> 00:08:53,851
Haha!

178
00:08:53,851 --> 00:08:58,288
Please look after me!

179
00:08:58,288 --> 00:09:00,257
Haha, please look after me!

180
00:09:00,257 --> 00:09:01,525
Oh, he’s so bashful.

181
00:09:01,558 --> 00:09:04,061
I’m sorry?

182
00:09:04,061 --> 00:09:06,830
It’s nice to meet you, really..

183
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:10,267
‘thank you’? One, two, three!

184
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,002
I’m sorry.

185
00:09:12,035 --> 00:09:14,204
I’m sorry.

186
00:09:16,607 --> 00:09:19,643
Hey, give haha’s mother a call.

187
00:09:19,676 --> 00:09:20,978
Call haha’s mother.

188
00:09:21,011 --> 00:09:24,181
Hey, what did you choose?

189
00:09:24,748 --> 00:09:26,216
Aigoo my stomach.

190
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:29,386
Give haha’s mother a call!

191
00:09:29,419 --> 00:09:31,555
-I was joking. -That’s right.

192
00:09:31,555 --> 00:09:34,558
Thank you sir.

193
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:39,496
-I like it. -Hey, Haha’s dead today.

194
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:40,564
Ok next!

195
00:09:40,597 --> 00:09:41,732
Please look after me.

196
00:09:41,732 --> 00:09:43,467
Yeah these guys are dead.

197
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,701
Ok!

198
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:48,138
Look at Gary, Gary.

199
00:09:48,138 --> 00:09:49,740
Gary’s now..

200
00:09:49,773 --> 00:09:51,975
Gary doesn’t dare look directly at Joon Gyu hyung.

201
00:09:52,009 --> 00:09:53,010
Time, time.

202
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:54,444
I’ve told him coolly.

203
00:09:54,478 --> 00:09:58,315
I’m.. I’m uncomfortable with him.

204
00:09:58,348 --> 00:10:00,083
Why hyung?

205
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:01,318
He’s the scariest!

206
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:03,120
-oh why? -ok.

207
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,821
-gary’s not bad. -one two three!

208
00:10:04,821 --> 00:10:05,822
Gary’s nice.

209
00:10:05,822 --> 00:10:08,091
Gary hyung’s good.

210
00:10:08,091 --> 00:10:11,495
-Oh Jong Kook. -Jong Kook!

211
00:10:11,495 --> 00:10:14,031
Hyung, you’re not supposed to hold my hand first.

212
00:10:14,031 --> 00:10:16,099
You can only hold my hand after I agree.

213
00:10:16,099 --> 00:10:17,734
I’m the one choosing.

214
00:10:17,768 --> 00:10:18,802
Seriously..

215
00:10:18,802 --> 00:10:24,708
When I’m having a difficult time I always dream about you.

216
00:10:24,741 --> 00:10:26,710
If you are there..

217
00:10:26,743 --> 00:10:28,345
..I won’t jerk awake while sleeping.

218
00:10:28,378 --> 00:10:31,748
And I can sleep well

219
00:10:31,748 --> 00:10:35,319
-good. -one two three!

220
00:10:35,319 --> 00:10:38,722
-thank you hyung -yeah.

221
00:10:38,755 --> 00:10:40,223
My man!

222
00:10:43,727 --> 00:10:46,563
Today’s my first time on Running Man.

223
00:10:46,597 --> 00:10:47,364
Yes.

224
00:10:47,397 --> 00:10:48,999
I’m a little bit burdened.

225
00:10:49,032 --> 00:10:51,768
Because I’m not familiar with their styles, it’s better to be with someone I know.

226
00:10:51,768 --> 00:10:53,870
-Just follow the rules. -I said I can’t.

227
00:10:53,904 --> 00:10:57,574
-I said I can’t -Follow the rules!

228
00:10:57,608 --> 00:10:59,876
My nickname in school was Holmes.

229
00:10:59,876 --> 00:11:00,811
Why?

230
00:11:00,811 --> 00:11:02,779
Larry Holmes.

231
00:11:02,813 --> 00:11:03,647
I’m sorry.

232
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,749
-it's not Sherlock Holmes but Larry Holmes. -I want to be with Suk Jin.

233
00:11:05,782 --> 00:11:08,552
With Suk Jin.

234
00:11:08,552 --> 00:11:10,854
I don’t want to.

235
00:11:10,887 --> 00:11:12,856
Why?

236
00:11:12,856 --> 00:11:14,891
I don’t want to! Hey.

237
00:11:14,891 --> 00:11:16,660
Suk Jin hyung!

238
00:11:16,693 --> 00:11:18,762
Seriously.

239
00:11:18,762 --> 00:11:22,733
Hey, kneel on both knees!

240
00:11:22,733 --> 00:11:25,636
Brat, alright then.

241
00:11:28,872 --> 00:11:32,142
Hey, what kind of guests are we?

242
00:11:32,142 --> 00:11:35,245
Let’s have some dignity.

243
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:38,682
Mr Yoo Jae Suk will choose one person from the remaining members.

244
00:11:38,682 --> 00:11:41,018
What do I do about this? This is seriously..

245
00:11:41,018 --> 00:11:43,787
What do I do?

246
00:11:44,321 --> 00:11:44,821
Gwang Soo.

247
00:11:44,821 --> 00:11:50,560
-Hey, the Giraffe wants to be chosen. -I’m very anxious.

248
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,929
I will get slightly angry, hyung.

249
00:11:52,963 --> 00:11:54,464
Hey if it’s like that..

250
00:11:54,498 --> 00:11:58,268
There’s no other choice but this

251
00:11:58,268 --> 00:12:02,572
-why don’t the two of you be together? -yeah!

252
00:12:06,009 --> 00:12:08,445
Oppa I really don’t want to.

253
00:12:08,478 --> 00:12:10,213
It’s a couple special today.

254
00:12:10,247 --> 00:12:12,115
Have a last journey today.

255
00:12:12,149 --> 00:12:14,584
Enjoy your last journey with Gary.

256
00:12:14,618 --> 00:12:18,922
Have the last journey.

257
00:12:18,955 --> 00:12:22,392
Have the last journey Ji Hyo.

258
00:12:27,364 --> 00:12:29,132
Oh it’s raining.

259
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:30,333
The weather is extremely bad too.

260
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:32,536
Sir you have to be careful.

261
00:12:32,569 --> 00:12:33,970
Do you want a hat?

262
00:12:34,004 --> 00:12:36,940
Haven’t you watched TV recently? This much is fine.

263
00:12:39,776 --> 00:12:41,678
Even with the wind..

264
00:12:41,712 --> 00:12:44,581
10m/second is no problem.

265
00:12:46,183 --> 00:12:50,153
These days, he washes his hair.

266
00:12:50,187 --> 00:12:53,857
10m/second.. Oh my stomach.

267
00:12:53,857 --> 00:12:55,959
Oh it’s really hilarious.

268
00:12:55,992 --> 00:12:57,594
Diving is fine too

269
00:12:57,594 --> 00:13:00,297
I hope the wind blows for once, hyungnim.

270
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:00,964
Ok.

271
00:13:00,997 --> 00:13:03,433
Ok I’m revealing today’s mission.

272
00:13:03,433 --> 00:13:06,436
Ok today’s mission is..

273
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:10,774
Since we’re in Cheorwon, a Fishing Race.

274
00:13:12,275 --> 00:13:15,078
Get fishing equipments for the race.

275
00:13:15,112 --> 00:13:18,482
Then head to the final fishing location to fish.

276
00:13:18,482 --> 00:13:22,986
Also the team that catches the largest fish within the time limit is the winner.

277
00:13:23,019 --> 00:13:27,124
Then the winning team will be awarded golden fishing floats.

278
00:13:30,193 --> 00:13:32,195
Go to G Land and find the Running Man banner.

279
00:13:32,195 --> 00:13:33,396
Where’s G land?

280
00:13:38,335 --> 00:13:40,971
You should wear a wig or put on a hat.

281
00:13:40,971 --> 00:13:42,439
What’s wrong with this?

282
00:13:42,439 --> 00:13:44,841
Hey I have no benefits being with you!

283
00:13:44,841 --> 00:13:45,609
Why?

284
00:13:45,642 --> 00:13:47,577
I use banmal with you.

285
00:13:47,611 --> 00:13:49,479
The audience thinks that I’m young.

286
00:13:49,513 --> 00:13:52,082
Why.. Why do yo look so old?

287
00:13:52,115 --> 00:13:53,583
I look, I look dirty?

288
00:13:53,617 --> 00:13:55,452
You look old, old.

289
00:13:55,452 --> 00:13:58,622
Oh I didn’t say it earlier,

290
00:13:58,688 --> 00:14:02,292
When I chose you, you should have said "hey friend, good to see you".

291
00:14:02,325 --> 00:14:05,862
Even if I knew it was a joke, did you have to ask me to kneel?

292
00:14:05,862 --> 00:14:09,065
Hey you’re the one who kneeled down first. Did I tell you to do that?

293
00:14:09,065 --> 00:14:13,069
Then you should have asked me to get up, but you told me to be on both knees?

294
00:14:13,069 --> 00:14:15,505
Jeez, that’s why it livened up the atmosphere.

295
00:14:15,505 --> 00:14:19,142
What atmosphere? Hey that sort of gag, what era is this now?

296
00:14:19,142 --> 00:14:21,611
While I’m in Running Man..

297
00:14:21,611 --> 00:14:23,346
How many years has it been?

298
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:25,282
About 1year and 7 to 8 months.

299
00:14:25,282 --> 00:14:27,284
Isn’t it about time to quit?

300
00:14:29,152 --> 00:14:30,320
Aren’t you out of line?

301
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,390
Actors can leave during a drama, when they die.

302
00:14:33,423 --> 00:14:36,526
You know, Deok Hwa hyung and I acted in History of the Salaryman.

303
00:14:36,526 --> 00:14:37,527
Right right.

304
00:14:37,561 --> 00:14:42,933
Following my death in History of the Salaryman, the drama started to unfold.

305
00:14:42,933 --> 00:14:47,704
It’s really similar to me, in Running Man, following my death..

306
00:14:47,704 --> 00:14:50,373
..it signifies the start of the race.

307
00:14:50,407 --> 00:14:51,541
We’re both the same.

308
00:14:51,575 --> 00:14:54,611
-okay. For the win, fighting! -Good! Fighting!

309
00:14:55,412 --> 00:14:56,546
Gwang Soo!

310
00:14:56,546 --> 00:14:57,948
Yes hyung.

311
00:14:57,981 --> 00:15:01,751
There’s hardly anything to talk about in the car.

312
00:15:01,785 --> 00:15:04,221
With you beside me.

313
00:15:04,254 --> 00:15:05,922
Hyung.

314
00:15:05,922 --> 00:15:06,756
What, Gwang Soo?

315
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:11,895
Recently I’ve been, extremely sharp about, about what should be done next.

316
00:15:25,442 --> 00:15:27,143
Talk about something.

317
00:15:27,177 --> 00:15:28,078
Why?

318
00:15:28,078 --> 00:15:30,046
-say something. -about what?

319
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:32,249
-talk about this or that, oppa. -why, why?

320
00:15:32,282 --> 00:15:33,283
It’s too awkward.

321
00:15:33,283 --> 00:15:34,618
-Why is it awkward? - it’s awkward.

322
00:15:34,618 --> 00:15:38,321
I’m fine though?

323
00:15:38,355 --> 00:15:41,524
Are we going to do it outside when it’s raining now?

324
00:15:41,558 --> 00:15:42,859
You know, usually..

325
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:46,997
Two months ago I would say, "I’ll be your umbrella".

326
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:49,633
"I’ll be your umbrella, Ji Hyo."

327
00:15:49,633 --> 00:15:51,635
That’s right, it’s good that we’re together.

328
00:15:51,668 --> 00:15:53,470
Of course.

329
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:06,516
So, is there something to bond it?

330
00:16:06,549 --> 00:16:09,819
There’s a medication to attach it.

331
00:16:09,853 --> 00:16:12,155
It’s amazing these days.

332
00:16:12,188 --> 00:16:13,156
Even diving as well?

333
00:16:13,189 --> 00:16:14,391
Of course.

334
00:16:14,424 --> 00:16:16,326
Really.

335
00:16:16,359 --> 00:16:18,662
The medicine's very strong.

336
00:16:18,695 --> 00:16:23,066
If I attach it with the super strong one,

337
00:16:23,066 --> 00:16:25,602
If someone pulls it, the scalp might get torn.

338
00:16:28,872 --> 00:16:30,573
I found it, hyungnim.

339
00:16:31,942 --> 00:16:33,376
Good!

340
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:35,412
I got it!

341
00:16:37,914 --> 00:16:40,050
Let’s hurry up a bit.

342
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:41,751
Those behind are catching up.

343
00:16:41,785 --> 00:16:43,353
Really? Let’s hurry.

344
00:16:43,353 --> 00:16:46,389
They have all kinds of rides here.

345
00:16:55,198 --> 00:16:58,668
This is Deok Hwa hyung. This person, is out Collar-Grabbing PD.

346
00:16:58,702 --> 00:17:00,003
He’s extremely good at pissing you off.

347
00:17:00,003 --> 00:17:01,638
You can grab his collar.

348
00:17:01,638 --> 00:17:02,672
Will he grab my collar?

349
00:17:02,706 --> 00:17:03,740
No no.

350
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:06,176
You look here!

351
00:17:12,749 --> 00:17:13,416
Myeon Sang hyung!

352
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:16,519
Hey run! Hey run quickly!

353
00:17:16,519 --> 00:17:18,021
Hey I said run.

354
00:17:18,054 --> 00:17:19,356
Hey why are you like this?

355
00:17:19,356 --> 00:17:22,092

356
00:17:23,193 --> 00:17:24,461
Line up line up

357
00:17:24,461 --> 00:17:25,762
I was first.

358
00:17:25,795 --> 00:17:28,031
Why are you looking at ours?

359
00:17:28,064 --> 00:17:29,399
-excuse me, ahjusshi -yes

360
00:17:29,432 --> 00:17:32,235
-how are you doing with the chairman? -it’s great, why?

361
00:17:32,302 --> 00:17:33,670
Chairman please say something!

362
00:17:34,337 --> 00:17:36,172
Ji hyo, have you ridden a carousel before?

363
00:17:36,172 --> 00:17:37,974
Of course I have.

364
00:17:37,974 --> 00:17:38,975
Who did you ride it with?

365
00:17:39,042 --> 00:17:41,845
-did you ride it with that person? -come quickly.

366
00:17:41,878 --> 00:17:44,180
It’s funny, why?

367
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:46,649
Oh these two. Hey come together.

368
00:17:48,184 --> 00:17:49,452
Hold hands.

369
00:17:49,452 --> 00:17:52,622
Ok please be quiet.

370
00:17:52,622 --> 00:17:56,593
The chairman is here and you’re telling us to be quiet?

371
00:17:56,593 --> 00:18:00,230
The combined age of this couple here is over 100 years old.

372
00:18:00,263 --> 00:18:04,167
Be quiet.

373
00:18:04,167 --> 00:18:08,071
Ok choose a textbook that you like.

374
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:10,473
What do we choose?

375
00:18:10,473 --> 00:18:13,610
-choose Korean language. -Korean language? Ok.

376
00:18:13,643 --> 00:18:14,411
Korean language, we chose Korean language.

377
00:18:14,411 --> 00:18:16,079
-this one, this one. -stop shoving.

378
00:18:16,112 --> 00:18:17,447
Do it slowly.

379
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:19,182
There’s an order here.

380
00:18:19,215 --> 00:18:20,116
Don’t push me.

381
00:18:20,116 --> 00:18:23,453
The mission card is inside.

382
00:18:23,486 --> 00:18:26,022
Come here to confirm the mission card with me.

383
00:18:26,022 --> 00:18:27,590
I think I’ve picked the wrong one.

384
00:18:27,624 --> 00:18:31,361
Ok Lee Deok Hwa’s team will take the aerial bicycle. Do you see it there?

385
00:18:31,394 --> 00:18:33,163
Please go up there.

386
00:18:33,196 --> 00:18:34,731
Go up from there.

387
00:18:38,435 --> 00:18:41,504
Please check and show it to me.

388
00:18:42,639 --> 00:18:43,840
How about us?

389
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,743
Please go that way.

390
00:18:48,044 --> 00:18:52,215
Why did you choose the Science textbook? I wanted Geography.

391
00:18:52,248 --> 00:18:55,151
Let’s exchange let’s exchange.

392
00:18:55,185 --> 00:18:56,252
You can’t do that. Only one chance.

393
00:18:56,252 --> 00:19:01,424
It’s because our lower body lack strength.

394
00:19:01,458 --> 00:19:03,460
I have no strength in my lower body.

395
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:05,428
What do you get?

396
00:19:05,428 --> 00:19:07,530
Aerial bicycles.

397
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:08,998
Follow along.

398
00:19:09,032 --> 00:19:11,234
Follow along.

399
00:19:19,075 --> 00:19:21,244
Ok I’ll explain to all of you once.

400
00:19:21,277 --> 00:19:23,913
Starting from here until you return,

401
00:19:23,947 --> 00:19:27,450
After you set off, these two friends will follow you right behind.

402
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:28,852
Just make sure they don’t catch you.

403
00:19:28,885 --> 00:19:29,686
By these guys?

404
00:19:29,719 --> 00:19:31,354
Yes.

405
00:19:38,461 --> 00:19:42,932
Hey how are we going to do it with these legs?

406
00:19:42,932 --> 00:19:45,935
But these friends are athletes.

407
00:19:49,639 --> 00:19:51,374
I..

408
00:19:51,407 --> 00:19:52,809
Now..

409
00:19:52,842 --> 00:19:58,148
I’ve only rode amusement park rides 3 times in my sixty years.

410
00:19:58,181 --> 00:19:59,983
It’s my first time on this thing.

411
00:20:00,016 --> 00:20:01,217
Please be careful hyungnim.

412
00:20:01,251 --> 00:20:04,954
-Hyung be careful. -if this goes above 10km/hour will it..

413
00:20:04,954 --> 00:20:07,056
Don’t worry, don’t worry about my hair.

414
00:20:07,056 --> 00:20:09,192
He can go under 10m of water.

415
00:20:12,128 --> 00:20:17,000
-Gwang Soo! -yes hyung!

416
00:20:17,033 --> 00:20:19,202
-Gwang Soo! -yes hyung!

417
00:20:21,004 --> 00:20:23,640
Because of you we’re here at the Viking, the Viking.

418
00:20:26,142 --> 00:20:28,077
Each person sits at the ends of the Viking.

419
00:20:28,111 --> 00:20:31,347
One person will describe a word while the other person guesses it.

420
00:20:31,381 --> 00:20:32,549
We can do it right, oppa?

421
00:20:32,582 --> 00:20:35,051
You’re describing? I don’t do it well.

422
00:20:35,084 --> 00:20:36,586
Are you good at guessing?

423
00:20:36,619 --> 00:20:37,921
Yeah not too bad.

424
00:20:37,954 --> 00:20:39,622
-I got it, I’ll do the explaining. -I got it

425
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:42,358
I will do my best.

426
00:20:42,358 --> 00:20:45,662
-If we don’t want to be caught by them.. -yes, we have to go as fast as possible.

427
00:20:45,662 --> 00:20:46,663
Hyung.

428
00:20:46,663 --> 00:20:47,730
Please take care of us.

429
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:49,432
Got it.

430
00:20:52,435 --> 00:20:53,369
Set off!

431
00:20:53,369 --> 00:20:57,073
-hey! -we’re off!

432
00:20:58,608 --> 00:21:00,510
Set off!

433
00:21:17,126 --> 00:21:18,194
They’re coming, they’re coming.

434
00:21:18,228 --> 00:21:19,529
-They’re coming already? -yes.

435
00:21:20,163 --> 00:21:21,698
They’re coming, they’re coming.

436
00:21:27,503 --> 00:21:29,539
Hey they are very fast!

437
00:21:29,572 --> 00:21:32,875
The string is tangled.

438
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:34,677
We’re tangled up!

439
00:21:34,711 --> 00:21:37,814
The string is tangled.

440
00:21:37,814 --> 00:21:39,515
We’re tangled up!

441
00:21:39,515 --> 00:21:42,252
Hey don’t do it!

442
00:21:42,252 --> 00:21:47,490
Don’t do it, don’t do it. Don’t do it!

443
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:48,625
Jeez

444
00:21:52,962 --> 00:21:53,596
it's over!

445
00:21:53,630 --> 00:21:56,466
Hey what are you guys?

446
00:21:56,499 --> 00:22:00,169
-since we’re caught, let’s conserve our energy. -yes.

447
00:22:00,203 --> 00:22:01,537
Let’s get them to push us.

448
00:22:01,571 --> 00:22:03,006
Hey you guys can push us.

449
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:05,808
-I can’t do it. Seriously. -seriously.

450
00:22:06,009 --> 00:22:08,044
You saw it all right?

451
00:22:08,044 --> 00:22:10,513
Push quickly!

452
00:22:10,513 --> 00:22:12,448
Are they pushing them from behind?

453
00:22:12,448 --> 00:22:14,117
Hyungnim is not doing anything now.

454
00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:15,485
They’re really pushing them from behind.

455
00:22:15,518 --> 00:22:17,320
I’m seriously..

456
00:22:17,353 --> 00:22:19,222
Hey we were caught over here.

457
00:22:20,323 --> 00:22:21,391
Oh chairman!

458
00:22:21,424 --> 00:22:23,559
-chairman how are you? -we got caught.

459
00:22:23,559 --> 00:22:25,295
We were caught right from the start

460
00:22:25,328 --> 00:22:26,929
-yes -who are these guys?

461
00:22:27,764 --> 00:22:29,132
You do something about them.

462
00:22:29,165 --> 00:22:31,534
Haha, take good care of the chairman.

463
00:22:32,402 --> 00:22:35,004
This is unfair.

464
00:22:35,038 --> 00:22:36,806
Hyungnim, please come over here.

465
00:22:36,839 --> 00:22:39,008
These friends, come over here.

466
00:22:39,008 --> 00:22:41,411
-how can you catch us from the start? -what sport do you do?

467
00:22:41,411 --> 00:22:42,412
I’m a mixed martial arts athlete.

468
00:22:42,445 --> 00:22:43,413
Mixed martial arts? And you?

469
00:22:43,413 --> 00:22:44,580
I’m a judo athlete.

470
00:22:44,614 --> 00:22:46,115
-hey, call someone for me. -who?

471
00:22:46,149 --> 00:22:50,119
-Shim Gwon Ho, at Taerung National Training Centre. -take it easy hyungnim.

472
00:22:50,153 --> 00:22:52,055
Taerung National Training.

473
00:22:52,055 --> 00:22:54,223
We just need to run away?

474
00:22:54,257 --> 00:22:55,992
We really won’t be caught.

475
00:22:55,992 --> 00:22:58,594
-we’ll go all out, hyung? -yeah yeah.

476
00:22:58,594 --> 00:22:59,295
Immediately!

477
00:22:59,329 --> 00:23:00,563
Ok get ready!

478
00:23:00,563 --> 00:23:01,664
Immediately.

479
00:23:01,664 --> 00:23:04,000
-start! -let’s go let’s go.

480
00:23:10,707 --> 00:23:12,975
This is fast, it’s fast.

481
00:23:12,975 --> 00:23:14,010
We’re going too fast.

482
00:23:14,010 --> 00:23:15,244
Our legs.

483
00:23:17,914 --> 00:23:22,585
But this..

484
00:23:22,618 --> 00:23:24,687
Hyungnim, this is..

485
00:23:24,721 --> 00:23:25,822
Hey they’re too fast.

486
00:23:25,855 --> 00:23:27,924
Why are you going so fast?

487
00:23:27,957 --> 00:23:28,758
Are we caught?

488
00:23:28,791 --> 00:23:29,392
Yes.

489
00:23:29,425 --> 00:23:30,560
They got caught, they got caught.

490
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,295
Even better, the end!

491
00:23:32,295 --> 00:23:33,896
Out! Out out.

492
00:23:36,599 --> 00:23:38,034
How did they catch up so fast?

493
00:23:38,067 --> 00:23:39,068
How did you come so soon?

494
00:23:39,102 --> 00:23:40,670
We were going extremely fast?

495
00:23:40,703 --> 00:23:42,071
Ji Hyo, let’s do this in one try.

496
00:23:42,071 --> 00:23:43,473
-oppa one try -one try.

497
00:23:45,341 --> 00:23:51,381
Oh I don’t like this. Oh oh hang on.

498
00:23:51,381 --> 00:23:53,383
But you two..

499
00:23:53,383 --> 00:23:58,521
Both of you look like first loves.

500
00:23:58,554 --> 00:24:01,357
Why did you put us so far apart?

501
00:24:08,631 --> 00:24:13,102
Start!

502
00:24:13,102 --> 00:24:15,271
-hurry! -Son Dambi!

503
00:24:15,304 --> 00:24:15,938
Crazy?

504
00:24:15,972 --> 00:24:17,740
No.

505
00:24:17,774 --> 00:24:19,409
What comes after Friday?

506
00:24:19,442 --> 00:24:21,477
Saturday! Saturday!

507
00:24:21,511 --> 00:24:22,678
Next question.

508
00:24:22,712 --> 00:24:25,047
Oppa, what do they call you?

509
00:24:25,081 --> 00:24:25,648
Prince-like.

510
00:24:25,681 --> 00:24:28,217
The opposite of that.

511
00:24:28,251 --> 00:24:30,253
Sir Lee Deok Hwa!

512
00:24:30,286 --> 00:24:32,789
Sharp.

513
00:24:32,789 --> 00:24:35,491
Oppa, Lee Deok Hwa sunbaenim did it.

514
00:24:35,491 --> 00:24:37,727
The ball he kicked.

515
00:24:37,727 --> 00:24:38,227
Soccer!

516
00:24:38,227 --> 00:24:39,629
But in front if it..

517
00:24:39,629 --> 00:24:41,531

00:24:41,531 --> 00:24:42,131
Soccer shoe?

00:24:42,131 --> 00:24:43,833
No hey!

520
00:24:43,866 --> 00:24:45,501
What is it?

521
00:24:45,501 --> 00:24:47,203
-hey. -oh hang on.

522
00:24:47,236 --> 00:24:50,239
Oppa, it’s a big fish, it’s a big fish.

523
00:24:50,239 --> 00:24:53,209
A big fish, if you fish it up, wow it’s daebak

524
00:24:53,209 --> 00:24:55,344

Hey!

527
00:25:00,316 --> 00:25:03,653
A very big fish!

528
00:25:03,686 --> 00:25:04,487
Daebak!

529
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:06,722

00:25:06,722 --> 00:25:08,991
-Daebak, you’re the daebak one! -oh hang on.

531
00:25:08,991 --> 00:25:10,860
Hey hurry up.

532
00:25:11,961 --> 00:25:14,530
It’s over.

533
00:25:14,530 --> 00:25:15,131
Are they eliminated?

534
00:25:15,131 --> 00:25:16,299
Gwang Soo.

535
00:25:16,332 --> 00:25:17,033

Why? Why oppa?

-oppa, it’s going to go totally high. -this is crazy.

553
00:25:50,032 --> 00:25:56,873
The scaredy-cat pair are suddenly very nervous.

00:25:56,873 --> 00:25:59,175

You have to give us some space, then slowly catch up.

Ah really.

629
00:28:51,781 --> 00:28:54,684

00:33:27,022 --> 00:33:30,059

716
00:33:30,059 --> 00:33:32,561
-Chungmuro! -ok!

717
00:33:32,594 --> 00:33:35,230
That thing you use for fishing! 2 words!

718
00:33:35,264 --> 00:33:37,533
-hook! -no no!

719
00:33:37,533 --> 00:33:39,668
Curved! Curved!

720
00:33:39,668 --> 00:33:41,437
-fish bait! -ok!

721
00:33:43,138 --> 00:33:46,508
Huh?

722
00:33:46,508 --> 00:33:49,511
4 words! 1,2,3?

723
00:33:49,511 --> 00:33:54,149
-4,5,6,7,8! -Park Sang.

724
00:33:54,183 --> 00:33:55,951
Myeon?

725
00:33:55,951 --> 00:33:58,821
Hyung’s favourite colour!

726
00:33:58,821 --> 00:34:01,423
-Choroksaek (green) -ok!

727
00:34:01,457 --> 00:34:03,559
Blank Na da la ma pa sa?

728
00:34:03,592 --> 00:34:04,560
4 words!

729
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:06,795
Ka Na da la ma pa sa.

730
00:34:06,829 --> 00:34:07,896
What?

731
00:34:07,930 --> 00:34:10,165
Put them together, the 4 words!

732
00:34:10,165 --> 00:34:14,770
-Samyeon choga? -ok!

733
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:20,409
So we choose?

734
00:34:21,010 --> 00:34:22,077
It’s going to rain, hurry!

735
00:34:22,111 --> 00:34:24,113
Ji Hyo, this one feels right?

736
00:34:24,146 --> 00:34:25,547
This is good too.

737
00:34:25,581 --> 00:34:29,952
There are 5 joints, 2 joints, it’s here right?

738
00:34:29,985 --> 00:34:32,888
Let’s take the one that says 30.

739
00:34:32,921 --> 00:34:34,590
We’ll choose this one

740
00:34:35,057 --> 00:34:37,292
-please bring it with you. -ok.

741
00:34:38,594 --> 00:34:41,196
Go to Hwa River and look for the running man banner

742
00:34:41,196 --> 00:34:44,166
-everyone, you have worked hard! -see you!

743
00:34:49,972 --> 00:34:51,473
A little harder!

744
00:34:52,741 --> 00:34:53,776
Oh it‘s tiring.

745
00:34:56,211 --> 00:34:58,380
Hey you guys pedal slower! Slower!

746
00:35:00,783 --> 00:35:04,386
My legs have no more strength.

747
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:07,623
They were doing well, what’s wrong now?

748
00:35:08,223 --> 00:35:09,658
What should we do? We’re sorry.

749
00:35:10,292 --> 00:35:11,527
Hey don’t poke us!

750
00:35:11,527 --> 00:35:13,095
Poke them!

751
00:35:13,128 --> 00:35:16,098
Poke Poke Poke!

752
00:35:21,837 --> 00:35:23,105
They got him.

753
00:35:24,273 --> 00:35:26,375
We did it right?

754
00:35:26,375 --> 00:35:28,110
Jong Kook hyung was poked.

755
00:35:28,110 --> 00:35:32,281
Hey the chasing duo come over here!

756
00:35:32,281 --> 00:35:36,385
You guys quickly get to it!

757
00:35:36,452 --> 00:35:39,488
It’s your turn now!

758
00:35:39,521 --> 00:35:43,092
Now the two, the other two, come over!

759
00:35:43,092 --> 00:35:46,228
According to the rule, the next team is them.

760
00:35:46,261 --> 00:35:50,432
The other two are ours! Come on, you have to go another round!

761
00:35:52,501 --> 00:35:53,035
Hey go for another round.

762
00:35:53,068 --> 00:35:54,169
Go!

763
00:35:54,203 --> 00:35:56,371
Slowly, slowly, like this.

764
00:35:56,405 --> 00:35:58,740
Oh it’s raining.

765
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:01,610
Good, the timing is good.

766
00:36:01,610 --> 00:36:04,012
Ok slowly.

767
00:36:04,847 --> 00:36:06,582
It’s ok if we continue like this.

768
00:36:07,549 --> 00:36:09,384
They have already caught up to us!

769
00:36:09,384 --> 00:36:15,691
Hey don’t come closer! Don’t come closer!

770
00:36:17,092 --> 00:36:19,361
Why are they so fast?

771
00:36:25,701 --> 00:36:28,837
Why do you keep missing your steps?

772
00:36:28,871 --> 00:36:32,641
It’s raining! Oh the rain.

773
00:36:32,674 --> 00:36:34,409
They are not breathing hard at all.

774
00:36:34,443 --> 00:36:38,413
No water for them!

775
00:36:39,915 --> 00:36:46,188
-why did you miss your steps? -it’s because it’s so slippery!

776
00:36:46,221 --> 00:36:48,757
You know, right? Go slowly

777
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:53,095
-set go! -go go!

778
00:36:54,263 --> 00:36:57,799
We must be careful. There’s no use pedaling too hard.

779
00:37:00,369 --> 00:37:04,840
Why are they there already! Go go go!

780
00:37:07,075 --> 00:37:09,611
-my legs are cramping! -we are close!

781
00:37:09,645 --> 00:37:12,581
They might make it!

782
00:37:12,581 --> 00:37:14,249
A bit more a bit more!

783
00:37:14,249 --> 00:37:16,218
Haha!

784
00:37:22,591 --> 00:37:24,493
They might make it!

785
00:37:24,526 --> 00:37:25,594
We did it!

786
00:37:25,627 --> 00:37:27,563
It’s a success, a success!

787
00:37:27,563 --> 00:37:31,400
We did it!

788
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:34,670
Hey hey!

789
00:37:34,703 --> 00:37:36,271
We did it!

790
00:37:39,641 --> 00:37:40,676
I can’t believe it.

791
00:37:40,676 --> 00:37:43,745
These two are tired too.

792
00:37:43,779 --> 00:37:47,616
Hey they are ours, ours!

793
00:37:47,649 --> 00:37:49,251
-my legs are going to have cramp. -Mine too!

794
00:37:49,251 --> 00:37:50,953
Alright come on.

795
00:37:50,986 --> 00:37:54,022
Come on boys!

796
00:37:54,056 --> 00:37:55,891
You were great chairman.

797
00:37:55,891 --> 00:37:58,060
My wig almost came off.

798
00:37:58,060 --> 00:38:01,697
At over 10km speed.

799
00:38:02,864 --> 00:38:05,500
Please choose a fishing rod.

800
00:38:06,702 --> 00:38:08,003
Is this one bad?

801
00:38:08,637 --> 00:38:12,140
-I don’t really know much about fishing. -Once selected, that’s it.

802
00:38:12,174 --> 00:38:14,409
I don’t really know much about fishing..

803
00:38:16,878 --> 00:38:19,781
Go to Hwa River and look for the running man banner.

804
00:38:19,848 --> 00:38:29,157
The successful team, please choose from the remaining fishing rods.

805
00:38:29,191 --> 00:38:30,392
This is good.

806
00:38:30,425 --> 00:38:32,861
This one? Ok ok. We’ll take this.

807
00:38:33,095 --> 00:38:36,798
For fishing, skills matter more than equipment.

808
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:41,970
Because I’m so lonely nowadays, I should be able to catch a lot of things.

809
00:38:47,709 --> 00:38:49,611
I got it from someone else.

810
00:38:49,645 --> 00:38:51,380
Really?

811
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:55,350
The VJ told me to give it to you.

812
00:38:55,384 --> 00:38:57,352
Because you looked very bored. Oh what is this?

813
00:38:57,386 --> 00:38:59,688
Even if it’s just bread, we are sharing it?

814
00:39:02,858 --> 00:39:04,493
-on the right -yes

815
00:39:05,627 --> 00:39:09,898
I can’t see anything except restaurants.

816
00:39:09,898 --> 00:39:11,933
I’m so hungry suddenly.

817
00:39:11,967 --> 00:39:14,336
There’s a supermarket in front. Do you want to go in?

818
00:39:14,336 --> 00:39:16,905
-shall we buy something to eat? -shall we?

819
00:39:16,938 --> 00:39:19,107
Let’s go buy something delicious.

820
00:39:23,445 --> 00:39:25,314
Ji Hyo, just choose anything you want.

821
00:39:25,347 --> 00:39:26,515
Oppa, can I really pick anything?

822
00:39:26,548 --> 00:39:29,084
Of course! But you have to start over with me!

823
00:39:44,333 --> 00:39:45,734
Last stretch!

824
00:39:53,208 --> 00:39:55,110
Success!

825
00:39:55,977 --> 00:39:57,879
Success!

826
00:40:05,921 --> 00:40:08,390
This is the worst one, right?

827
00:40:16,898 --> 00:40:20,001
I’m really tired. I’m really tired.

828
00:40:20,068 --> 00:40:22,704
It’s on the right?

829
00:40:22,738 --> 00:40:24,573
-we’re going to the right correct? -yes.

830
00:40:24,606 --> 00:40:28,677
But the lane is on the right..I’m a bit confused.

831
00:40:28,710 --> 00:40:30,479
Is this England?

832
00:40:30,512 --> 00:40:34,182
-if you’re not in your right mind now, let me drive. -no no.

833
00:40:34,182 --> 00:40:39,421
It’s the right side. If the handle is on the left, you have to be on the right lane.

834
00:40:39,621 --> 00:40:42,357
Hey we should have picked the Viking.

835
00:40:42,391 --> 00:40:43,992
Hey I ride Viking well.

836
00:40:44,025 --> 00:40:46,528
What’s the next again? What are we going to do there?

837
00:40:46,561 --> 00:40:48,029
There will be something.

838
00:40:48,029 --> 00:40:49,464
Didn’t we pick a fishing rod?

839
00:40:49,498 --> 00:40:53,402
-hey what fishing rod? It’s a bamboo stick! -how do we fish with this?

840
00:40:53,902 --> 00:40:55,537
There’s a banner here, hyung.

841
00:40:55,570 --> 00:40:56,772
That’s it.

842
00:40:56,805 --> 00:40:57,939
-we get off here? -yes hyung.

843
00:41:00,942 --> 00:41:03,078
Ok oh who’s that?

844
00:41:03,078 --> 00:41:05,580
Who is it? Hurry, let’s go quickly.

845
00:41:05,614 --> 00:41:07,082
Jong Kook, Jong Kook hyung.

846
00:41:07,115 --> 00:41:11,219
Hey you reached so quickly?

847
00:41:11,586 --> 00:41:14,823
Hyung, in running Man, we have to go faster.

848
00:41:14,823 --> 00:41:19,194
-isn’t it titled "running man"? -yeah, don’t stop, run.

849
00:41:19,227 --> 00:41:20,929
Oh what’s that there?

850
00:41:20,962 --> 00:41:22,097
Isn’t that a fishing outfit?

851
00:41:28,336 --> 00:41:30,572
-hey it’s books again. -aigoo aigoo

852
00:41:34,176 --> 00:41:37,245
-how about we stick to Korean language’ to the end, hyung? -alright.

853
00:41:37,279 --> 00:41:38,447
We’ll just stick by one way.

854
00:41:38,447 --> 00:41:41,716
Hyung seems like a mayfly went into your mouth.

855
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:43,351
A mayfly went inside.

856
00:41:43,385 --> 00:41:46,621
Hyung, are you hungry? Why are you eating mayfly?

857
00:41:46,655 --> 00:41:48,623
I’m hungry. let’s take ‘’Korean Language’.

858
00:41:48,657 --> 00:41:50,025
Ok I got it.

859
00:41:51,426 --> 00:41:54,362
Hey let’s choose world history

860
00:41:54,396 --> 00:41:55,063
-of course -world history?

861
00:41:55,096 --> 00:41:58,934
-the world is ours. -what’s up man? -All right, baby.

862
00:42:01,803 --> 00:42:03,638
Oh when did you arrive?

863
00:42:03,638 --> 00:42:05,040
Aren’t you the first team?

864
00:42:05,073 --> 00:42:06,107
Oh Gary.

865
00:42:06,141 --> 00:42:08,410
You guys look good together!

866
00:42:08,410 --> 00:42:11,213
-you even took the Viking together? -that’s right.

867
00:42:11,246 --> 00:42:12,581
We ate something nice.

868
00:42:12,614 --> 00:42:13,181
Really?

869
00:42:13,181 --> 00:42:14,416
-you ate? -yeah

870
00:42:14,449 --> 00:42:16,585
-ji Hyo, pick one you like -this is daebak.

871
00:42:16,618 --> 00:42:17,953
What?

872
00:42:17,986 --> 00:42:19,254
-truly -oppa, you choose one

873
00:42:19,287 --> 00:42:23,525
-are you trying to do what you couldn’t do before.. -then we’ll choose this!

874
00:42:25,026 --> 00:42:26,595
Remove your gloves.

875
00:42:29,698 --> 00:42:30,532
Oh.

876
00:42:30,532 --> 00:42:31,800
Hey!

877
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:33,535
Hey Suk Jin, you choose.

878
00:42:33,568 --> 00:42:34,669
What do we choose?

879
00:42:34,703 --> 00:42:36,137
I hate Math.

880
00:42:36,171 --> 00:42:37,772
Is that so?

881
00:42:40,308 --> 00:42:44,513
Ok now, can you see over there? There are baits.

882
00:42:44,513 --> 00:42:47,382
There are two methods of getting the bait.

883
00:42:47,382 --> 00:42:54,556
Over here is the shallow path to go straight while piggybacking.

884
00:42:55,490 --> 00:42:59,728
-we are all very heavy. -over there, is the canoeing route.

885
00:42:59,761 --> 00:43:02,797
We have to grab a canoe quickly.

886
00:43:02,931 --> 00:43:06,401
- Sir, if we fail into the water your wig wouldn't come off right? - Don't worry.

887
00:43:06,434 --> 00:43:08,003
It's even intact 10m below.

888
00:43:11,139 --> 00:43:13,775
Gwang Soo.

889
00:43:13,842 --> 00:43:19,881
I'm personally, very fond of you.

890
00:43:19,915 --> 00:43:22,751
But not when we're on the same team.

891
00:43:23,251 --> 00:43:25,253
Ok, get your members and set off quickly.

892
00:43:25,253 --> 00:43:27,989
Let's go. Let's go quickly.

893
00:43:28,023 --> 00:43:30,425
Hey, we've been running the entire day.

894
00:43:30,425 --> 00:43:32,961
- Hey Sang Myeon, are you ok? - Of course.

895
00:43:35,063 --> 00:43:37,499
- Can you carry me? - I'll carry you, hyung.

896
00:43:38,133 --> 00:43:39,701
Jong Kook.

897
00:43:39,734 --> 00:43:40,569
What are you doing?

898
00:43:40,569 --> 00:43:43,338
Our Joon Gyu hyung, he seriously chose well.

899
00:43:43,371 --> 00:43:45,774
You guys are piggybacking too so don't laugh at us.

900
00:43:45,774 --> 00:43:46,641
Where do we go?

901
00:43:46,641 --> 00:43:47,909
I don't know.

902
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:53,381
Piggyback.

903
00:43:57,419 --> 00:43:59,187
How can the last one be "piggyback"?

904
00:43:59,187 --> 00:44:01,089
Aren't there three boats?

905
00:44:01,122 --> 00:44:04,292
- Because of you really, nothing is going right! - No!

906
00:44:04,292 --> 00:44:06,294
It's not like that, hyung!

907
00:44:06,294 --> 00:44:07,963
- Hyung. - Seriously!

908
00:44:07,996 --> 00:44:10,298
It's all because of you.

909
00:44:10,298 --> 00:44:12,801
- Nothing is going right! - Hey, what are both of you doing?

910
00:44:13,268 --> 00:44:15,003
Hey, are we ready?

911
00:44:15,036 --> 00:44:15,670
Hold still, hold still.

912
00:44:15,670 --> 00:44:19,407
- You won't fall in, right? - Hey, we can't just balance ourselves.

913
00:44:19,407 --> 00:44:20,976
What then?

914
00:44:20,976 --> 00:44:22,377
- Be more relaxed. - Be relaxed.

915
00:44:22,410 --> 00:44:23,078
Relax.

916
00:44:23,111 --> 00:44:24,646
Just like you. One.

917
00:44:24,679 --> 00:44:25,680
One.

918
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:26,948
- One. - Two.

919
00:44:26,982 --> 00:44:28,783
- Hey, it's going more to this side. - Okay.

920
00:44:28,817 --> 00:44:31,186
- Hey, you. - One. Yeah?

921
00:44:31,186 --> 00:44:34,990
You… that's right, that sides' correct.

922
00:44:35,023 --> 00:44:35,957
- Two. - That's right.

923
00:44:35,957 --> 00:44:38,426
Hey, be careful. Don't fall into the water!

924
00:44:38,426 --> 00:44:40,161
- Hey Suk Jin. - Yeah?

925
00:44:40,195 --> 00:44:42,397
- Paddle a little more to the right. That's right, ok. - Oh? Ok.

926
00:44:42,430 --> 00:44:43,765
Forward. Forward.

927
00:44:43,798 --> 00:44:46,001
- Do you know how to do this? - Ok. Ok, go.

928
00:44:46,034 --> 00:44:48,336
- Oh hey, we're not too bad! - Ok, one, two.

929
00:44:48,370 --> 00:44:50,905
One, two. One, two.

930
00:44:52,107 --> 00:44:53,708
Hey, let's be careful!

931
00:44:53,742 --> 00:44:54,342
Ok!

932
00:44:54,409 --> 00:44:56,211
Haste makes waste.

933
00:44:56,311 --> 00:44:57,245
Yes.

934
00:44:57,278 --> 00:44:59,047
Woo!

935
00:45:01,983 --> 00:45:03,385
Wow oppa, you're doing great!

936
00:45:03,418 --> 00:45:05,253
- Straight ahead! - Hey, we're about to crash!

937
00:45:05,286 --> 00:45:10,158
Relax, relax.

938
00:45:10,191 --> 00:45:11,626
Hey, stop bumping into us.

939
00:45:11,660 --> 00:45:14,696
- Hey, more on your side. More, more. - More, more.

940
00:45:14,696 --> 00:45:15,664
Hey!

941
00:45:15,697 --> 00:45:17,565
Hey, don't knock into us! Hey, stay clear!

942
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:20,669
Hey, where are you going?

943
00:45:20,669 --> 00:45:22,337
Hey, it's going way off course!

944
00:45:22,404 --> 00:45:26,541
How did you steer way off from there?

945
00:45:26,541 --> 00:45:28,076
Hey, where exactly is this going? Hey.

946
00:45:28,109 --> 00:45:29,678
Hey, where did Jong Kook go?

947
00:45:29,711 --> 00:45:31,780
Jong Kook hyung went for a piggyback.

948
00:45:33,248 --> 00:45:36,217
This water is too cold.

949
00:45:36,251 --> 00:45:39,220
My legs are…

950
00:45:40,555 --> 00:45:46,261
This game is the most suited for you.

951
00:45:50,865 --> 00:45:51,566
Hey, let's get off quickly.

952
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:54,869
Get off, get off.

953
00:45:54,903 --> 00:45:56,805
It has to be on this side.

954
00:45:56,838 --> 00:45:58,606
The canoe has to be parked at the right place.

955
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:00,341
Ok, we're going to win.

956
00:46:00,341 --> 00:46:02,610
- Hey, push it! - The opposite direction, Ji Hyo.

957
00:46:02,610 --> 00:46:04,279
Like this, the opposite direction.

958
00:46:04,312 --> 00:46:07,215
Hyung! It's cold!

959
00:46:07,248 --> 00:46:13,521
- Hyung, what are you doing? - Hey, what are you doing? Hurry.

960
00:46:13,521 --> 00:46:15,090
- It's the right direction, it's the right direction. - Sunbae.

961
00:46:15,123 --> 00:46:17,492
We're here, we're first!

962
00:46:17,525 --> 00:46:19,561
Seriously!

963
00:46:19,594 --> 00:46:20,962
We're first, hyung.

964
00:46:20,962 --> 00:46:25,300
- Which do we choose? - Ok, there are five types of fish bait right here.

965
00:46:25,300 --> 00:46:26,101
Can we open them?

966
00:46:26,101 --> 00:46:27,435
The first one.

967
00:46:27,435 --> 00:46:29,537
- The best fish meal, paste bait. - Yeah.

968
00:46:29,537 --> 00:46:31,740
The second one, earthworms.

969
00:46:31,740 --> 00:46:34,075
The third, grasshoppers.

970
00:46:34,109 --> 00:46:35,944
The fourth, fruits.

971
00:46:35,944 --> 00:46:37,612
- What's this? - The last one.

972
00:46:37,612 --> 00:46:38,913
Raw meat.

973
00:46:38,913 --> 00:46:42,417
If you win at Rock, Paper, Scissors, you can choose one to take with you.

974
00:46:42,450 --> 00:46:44,586
Sir, let's start from you.

975
00:46:44,619 --> 00:46:48,690
Rock, Paper, Scissors!

976
00:46:48,723 --> 00:46:56,431
- This guy! - A pity.

977
00:46:56,431 --> 00:46:58,867
- Hey, change direction. - Hey, he's quite something.

978
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:01,736
- Hey, we have to go. - Get the signature before coming back.

979
00:47:01,770 --> 00:47:03,371
You guys must do well at Rock, Paper, Scissors.

980
00:47:03,404 --> 00:47:04,873
This guy. This guy!

981
00:47:04,906 --> 00:47:07,776
Oppa, I'll go first.

982
00:47:07,809 --> 00:47:10,678
- Of course. - You get your act together.

983
00:47:10,912 --> 00:47:11,980
- The first one. - Yes.

984
00:47:11,980 --> 00:47:13,548
It's a 100% win. Suk Jin, do it.

985
00:47:13,581 --> 00:47:16,651
Rock, Paper, Scissors!

986
00:47:16,684 --> 00:47:19,587
- Jeez, what? - We won right? - Please go back, yes. Get the signature and come back.

987
00:47:19,587 --> 00:47:23,191
- No, isn't there still me for Rock, Paper, Scissors? - You try too, you try too.

988
00:47:23,191 --> 00:47:25,627
Rock, Paper, Scissors!

989
00:47:33,034 --> 00:47:37,572
Rock, Paper, Scissors!

990
00:47:37,572 --> 00:47:40,041
You lost? You lost?

991
00:47:40,108 --> 00:47:42,177
Why couldn't even one person win at "Rock, Paper, Scissors"?

992
00:47:42,210 --> 00:47:43,745
Gwang Soo, hurry up.

993
00:47:43,778 --> 00:47:46,347
Gwang Soo. Hey, please.

994
00:47:47,482 --> 00:47:50,451
Why are those people sitting there?

995
00:47:50,485 --> 00:47:52,020
Hey Ji Hyo, where are you going?

996
00:47:52,053 --> 00:47:55,190
- Oppa, We lost at "Rock, Paper, Scissors" - So?

997
00:47:55,223 --> 00:47:57,959
We have to go back again and come back.

998
00:47:58,193 --> 00:48:00,361
You can take the bait if you win.

999
00:48:00,428 --> 00:48:02,330
- Really? - Have done it or not?

1000
00:48:02,363 --> 00:48:06,100
Come down, we came first.

1001
00:48:07,535 --> 00:48:09,370
Hey, this is, a chance for us.

1002
00:48:10,772 --> 00:48:13,274
Rock, Paper, Scissors!

1003
00:48:16,344 --> 00:48:18,713
- Yon won? - Sunbae looks tired.

1004
00:48:18,746 --> 00:48:20,081
Do it quickly!

1005
00:48:20,081 --> 00:48:22,617
We're telling you to move it.

1006
00:48:22,617 --> 00:48:25,320
- Hurry. - Rock, Paper, Scissors!

1007
00:48:29,724 --> 00:48:31,426
What did you say?

1008
00:48:31,492 --> 00:48:33,761
What do you have?

1009
00:48:33,795 --> 00:48:37,899
Earthworms, grasshoppers, fruits, raw meat and paste bait.

1010
00:48:37,932 --> 00:48:39,033
Grasshoppers?

1011
00:48:39,067 --> 00:48:42,136
The Grasshopper's here.

1012
00:48:42,170 --> 00:48:44,372
Hey, do it quickly!

1013
00:48:44,372 --> 00:48:45,907
- Are earth worms good? - They're good.

1014
00:48:45,940 --> 00:48:49,077
Be careful, sir!

1015
00:48:49,110 --> 00:48:52,080
If it's good, why did he turn his head away?

1016
00:48:52,113 --> 00:48:53,915
- Hey, hurry up! - How about paste bait, paste bait?

1017
00:48:53,948 --> 00:48:56,317
That's good too!

1018
00:48:56,351 --> 00:48:59,087
Hang on.

1019
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:02,190
All these carps like them!

1020
00:49:02,190 --> 00:49:03,925
- Four, three. - No, this raw meat?

1021
00:49:03,958 --> 00:49:06,361
Two, one.

1022
00:49:06,661 --> 00:49:08,029
- The best. - Yes, you picked the earthworms.

1023
00:49:08,062 --> 00:49:10,865
- Oh, the earthworms are good choice. - Next.

1024
00:49:10,899 --> 00:49:12,667
It's good right?

1025
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:13,534
What about the paste bait?

1026
00:49:13,568 --> 00:49:15,069
The paste bait's good too.

1027
00:49:15,103 --> 00:49:16,337
The fruits?

1028
00:49:16,371 --> 00:49:18,106
You go eat the fruits.

1029
00:49:18,139 --> 00:49:21,843
Hyung! What colour are you wearing now?

1030
00:49:21,876 --> 00:49:23,745
- Gwang Soo. - What colour are these clothes?

1031
00:49:23,745 --> 00:49:32,754
Give me the power of green.

1032
00:49:33,688 --> 00:49:35,857
Rock, Paper, Scissors!

1033
00:49:36,324 --> 00:49:40,929
He lost.

1034
00:49:42,830 --> 00:49:44,465
Haha!

1035
00:49:44,499 --> 00:49:46,901
Rock, Paper, Scissors!

1036
00:49:49,270 --> 00:49:51,973
Hyung, seems like you have to go once more.

1037
00:49:52,006 --> 00:49:53,841
What are you going to put out? What will you show?

1038
00:49:53,875 --> 00:49:55,176
I'll show rock.

1039
00:49:55,176 --> 00:49:56,711
You clearly said "rock"!

1040
00:49:56,744 --> 00:49:59,247
Rock, Paper, Scissors!

1041
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:00,782
Rock, Paper, Scissors!

1042
00:50:00,782 --> 00:50:04,252
Yay!

1043
00:50:04,285 --> 00:50:05,920
Quick, quick. Let's choose!

1044
00:50:05,987 --> 00:50:09,724
Sang Myeon, that meat is a good choice.

1045
00:50:09,724 --> 00:50:13,161
If you can't catch any fish, you still have meat to eat.

1046
00:50:15,063 --> 00:50:19,600
Seems like we still need to go back and forth five more times.

1047
00:50:19,634 --> 00:50:22,470
Ha... Ha… Aigoo.

1048
00:50:22,503 --> 00:50:24,405
- Paste bait! - Okay!

1049
00:50:24,439 --> 00:50:30,445
- Fish like this right? - Yes, paste bait.

1050
00:50:35,049 --> 00:50:38,252
- Go to Wasu Elementary School and find the Running Man banner. - Primary?

1051
00:50:38,286 --> 00:50:40,221
Let's go, hyungnim.

1052
00:50:40,254 --> 00:50:43,791
- Where are we going now? - Let's go, hyung.

1053
00:50:44,926 --> 00:50:47,829
- Gwang Soo! - Yes, hyung!

1054
00:50:47,862 --> 00:50:50,898
- Yoo! - Lee!

1055
00:50:50,898 --> 00:50:53,034
I miss you.

1056
00:50:58,139 --> 00:51:00,141
- There are three left. - Not much left.

1057
00:51:01,342 --> 00:51:04,078
Faster! Let's play Rock, Paper, Scissors!

1058
00:51:04,112 --> 00:51:08,883
- Rock, Paper, Scissors! - Rock, Paper, Scissors!

1059
00:51:10,385 --> 00:51:11,786
Hey, you can't even do this?

1060
00:51:11,819 --> 00:51:14,622
Yes, it's good that we broke up!

1061
00:51:14,622 --> 00:51:19,293
You two are very compatible.

1062
00:51:19,327 --> 00:51:22,196
Why can't you play Rock, Paper, Scissors well?

1063
00:51:22,196 --> 00:51:23,564
Rock, Paper, Scissors.

1064
00:51:27,301 --> 00:51:29,670
Collecting the power of green!

1065
00:51:29,737 --> 00:51:41,115
Green, give me your power!

1066
00:51:42,283 --> 00:51:45,386
Rock, Paper, Scissors!

1067
00:51:45,420 --> 00:51:48,389
Yes!

1068
00:51:48,890 --> 00:51:52,460
Jae Suk, the fruit isn't a bad choice.

1069
00:51:52,493 --> 00:51:56,964
Chairman, fishes don't eat fruit.

1070
00:51:56,998 --> 00:51:58,666
No, they might eat it.

1071
00:51:58,699 --> 00:52:03,271
In summer, we catch them with watermelons.

1072
00:52:03,304 --> 00:52:06,340
- Do we really have to take grasshoppers? - What's left?

1073
00:52:06,340 --> 00:52:08,042
Grasshoppers, fruit and meat.

1074
00:52:08,076 --> 00:52:09,744
- That's it? - Yes.

1075
00:52:09,744 --> 00:52:12,713
Haha, let's forget it.

1076
00:52:12,747 --> 00:52:15,183
- Would grasshoppers be the best? - Grasshopper?

1077
00:52:15,216 --> 00:52:17,552
What will they eat among the rests?

1078
00:52:17,585 --> 00:52:20,054
It's the grasshoppers.

1079
00:52:20,121 --> 00:52:22,490
Haha, we are in big trouble. We don't have much left to choose.

1080
00:52:22,523 --> 00:52:25,093
Hyung, it's a good sign.

1081
00:52:25,093 --> 00:52:28,296
Hyung is wearing a green dress holding the grasshopper.

1082
00:52:28,329 --> 00:52:31,432
- We will surely win today! - I'm going crazy.

1083
00:52:31,499 --> 00:52:33,701
Grasshopper, eat it yourself.

1084
00:52:33,734 --> 00:52:35,736
What do we do with these grasshoppers?

1085
00:52:35,736 --> 00:52:38,406
- Are those fried grasshoppers? - Yes.

1086
00:52:38,439 --> 00:52:41,409
Using it as side dish while drinking?

1087
00:52:41,442 --> 00:52:42,677
We… we are?

1088
00:52:42,677 --> 00:52:43,978
We are the controller of water.

1089
00:52:43,978 --> 00:52:46,848
- Controller of Water! - Controller of Water!

1090
00:52:46,848 --> 00:52:52,120
Controller of Water!

1091
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:55,123
One, two, three. Rock, Paper, Scissors!

1092
00:52:55,156 --> 00:52:59,227
Yeah!!

1093
00:52:59,293 --> 00:53:02,597
Let's choose meat.

1094
00:53:03,831 --> 00:53:05,066
We'll just grill it.

1095
00:53:05,066 --> 00:53:10,271
If we fail to catch any fish, let's eat them.

1096
00:53:10,304 --> 00:53:12,140
It's the fruit, then?

1097
00:53:12,140 --> 00:53:14,742
Meat and fruits, this guy.

1098
00:53:14,775 --> 00:53:17,011
Then what do we have?

1099
00:53:17,011 --> 00:53:22,783
- Only the fruit is left. - Fruit, fruit?

1100
00:53:30,024 --> 00:53:31,492
What is that, school bags?

1101
00:53:37,965 --> 00:53:41,903
Every couple need to wear a bracelet and fish for the seafood name tag.

1102
00:53:41,903 --> 00:53:44,505
We get to win windbreakers.

1103
00:53:44,505 --> 00:53:46,941
The two of you need to wear a bracelet.

1104
00:53:46,974 --> 00:53:51,312
Put on the bracelet.

1105
00:53:51,345 --> 00:53:53,848
Put on the bracelet and move together.

1106
00:53:53,848 --> 00:53:57,185
Be sure not to get the seafood nametags removed by someone.

1107
00:53:57,218 --> 00:54:00,087
The seafood name tags are inside the bags.

1108
00:54:00,121 --> 00:54:02,857
Starting now, you just need to get the seafood name tags.

1109
00:54:02,857 --> 00:54:04,192
Is there really seafood inside?

1110
00:54:04,192 --> 00:54:06,127
Hyung, it's seafood name tags.

1111
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:07,562
Hyung.

1112
00:54:07,595 --> 00:54:09,430
This is strange.

1113
00:54:11,766 --> 00:54:12,767
Oh?

1114
00:54:12,767 --> 00:54:16,370
- We came first! - Is that the headmaster?

1115
00:54:16,370 --> 00:54:18,773
We came here first!

1116
00:54:22,076 --> 00:54:23,678
Hyung, believe me this time.

1117
00:54:23,711 --> 00:54:25,279
- Okay, Gwang Soo. - I have a strong feeling.

1118
00:54:25,313 --> 00:54:26,714
Then you will choose!

1119
00:54:30,117 --> 00:54:31,852
What's this?

1120
00:54:32,186 --> 00:54:33,754
This one!

1121
00:54:33,788 --> 00:54:36,958
This one!

1122
00:54:36,991 --> 00:54:40,695
Is this a club? We are wearing a bracelet.

1123
00:54:40,728 --> 00:54:43,564
Ba ba ba bam.

1124
00:54:43,598 --> 00:54:46,400
Hyung, who still dances like this?

1125
00:54:46,434 --> 00:54:49,570
What is this?

1126
00:54:49,604 --> 00:54:50,438
Then what dance is trendy now?

1127
00:54:50,438 --> 00:54:52,039
Did you talk about club dancing in the car?

1128
00:54:52,039 --> 00:54:53,507
No.

1129
00:54:53,507 --> 00:54:55,343
We talked about our kids.

1130
00:54:55,343 --> 00:54:57,912
And their education.

1131
00:54:57,912 --> 00:55:01,582
- Which one should we choose? This? - Okay.

1132
00:55:01,616 --> 00:55:02,316
Let's go.

1133
00:55:02,316 --> 00:55:04,118
The bag suits you.

1134
00:55:04,151 --> 00:55:05,553
Carry it like that, on your side.

1135
00:55:05,586 --> 00:55:09,123
Hello, how are you?

1136
00:55:11,192 --> 00:55:13,394
We'll choose this.

1137
00:55:13,427 --> 00:55:16,697
- You can start once you put on the bracelet. - Where is the bracelet?

1138
00:55:16,697 --> 00:55:18,232
Looks like a race, a race.

1139
00:55:20,167 --> 00:55:21,769
I'm sorry.

1140
00:55:28,009 --> 00:55:31,946
- What to do? - I think we have to stick it on top of our nametags.

1141
00:55:37,051 --> 00:55:39,387
I think it will fall easily.

1142
00:55:39,387 --> 00:55:42,423
Stick it as tightly as possible.

1143
00:55:44,792 --> 00:55:46,494
Gwang Soo…

1144
00:55:48,763 --> 00:55:50,398
We're dead.

1145
00:55:50,398 --> 00:55:52,600
Why do you say that?

1146
00:55:55,303 --> 00:55:56,470
Did you tear it?

1147
00:55:56,504 --> 00:55:57,805
I didn't feel anything.

1148
00:55:57,805 --> 00:56:00,241
We're dead.

1149
00:56:01,976 --> 00:56:04,712
Why is the stingray so big?

1150
00:56:11,152 --> 00:56:14,922
Like this.

1151
00:56:14,922 --> 00:56:19,060
No, it's because I am bigger in size.

1152
00:56:21,595 --> 00:56:25,900
I can block it.

1153
00:56:25,900 --> 00:56:27,301
Let's go.

1154
00:56:31,572 --> 00:56:34,241
It's easily removed, so you need to stick it properly.

1155
00:56:35,209 --> 00:56:36,844
Mackerel?

1156
00:56:36,877 --> 00:56:39,347
Where do we stick this?

1157
00:56:39,380 --> 00:56:43,150
That's why it's small.

1158
00:56:44,118 --> 00:56:45,619
When we want to remove the nametags, we just tear it like this?

1159
00:56:45,619 --> 00:56:47,755
Of course, as long as you tear it off.

1160
00:56:47,788 --> 00:56:48,622
Mercilessly?

1161
00:56:48,622 --> 00:56:51,459
What if Jong Kook hyung wants to take off your nametag?

1162
00:56:51,492 --> 00:56:55,062
Jong Kook... next time, towards the others…

1163
00:56:55,062 --> 00:56:58,799
If Jong Kook hyung says "I'm sorry" then he starts to tear your name tag.

1164
00:56:58,799 --> 00:56:59,567
Then…

1165
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:01,802
How dare you!

1166
00:57:10,578 --> 00:57:11,946
Hyung, we definitely must get the windbreaker.

1167
00:57:11,979 --> 00:57:16,484
Of course. If we fish without a windbreaker, it's the end of us.

1168
00:57:30,531 --> 00:57:32,767
No matter what, use your charismatic acting skills.

1169
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:35,503
Charismatic act or cowardly act?

1170
00:57:35,536 --> 00:57:38,839
Back and forth to confuse them.

1171
00:57:39,807 --> 00:57:44,278
Why am I like this…

1172
00:57:49,650 --> 00:57:52,686
Gary.

1173
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:54,455
Gary, Gary.

1174
00:57:54,488 --> 00:57:57,224
Gary, Gary.

1175
00:57:57,258 --> 00:58:00,594
Do you know where he is?

1176
00:58:00,594 --> 00:58:02,296
Gary.

1177
00:58:02,296 --> 00:58:03,631
Who is on the second floor?

1178
00:58:03,664 --> 00:58:05,032
There is someone on the second floor.

1179
00:58:05,065 --> 00:58:06,901
This is Jae Suk hyung's VJ.

1180
00:58:06,901 --> 00:58:08,235
- Oh, really? - Yes.

1181
00:58:08,269 --> 00:58:10,371
Jae Suk.

1182
00:58:13,107 --> 00:58:14,141
- Oh, really? - Yes.

1183
00:58:14,175 --> 00:58:15,810
Jae Suk.

1184
00:58:18,145 --> 00:58:19,680
Jae Suk.

1185
00:58:22,550 --> 00:58:28,989
How can you eliminate me already?

1186
00:58:29,023 --> 00:58:33,227
Grasshopper, how can you do this?

1187
00:58:33,227 --> 00:58:35,362
Chairman, do you know why?

1188
00:58:35,362 --> 00:58:37,798
Because we have to do it quickly to get the windbreaker!

1189
00:58:37,832 --> 00:58:40,568
Didn't we let chairman live?

1190
00:58:40,601 --> 00:58:42,670
Gwang Soo, come here.

1191
00:58:42,703 --> 00:58:46,807
Hey, he is not your sunbae. He's the teacher, the teacher.

1192
00:58:46,841 --> 00:58:49,810
Come here, nearer. Your sunbae is calling you.

1193
00:58:49,844 --> 00:58:50,978
Are you crazy?

1194
00:58:51,011 --> 00:58:52,379
Are you trying to rebel?

1195
00:58:52,413 --> 00:58:54,882
Do you need me to shout over a small matter like this?

1196
00:58:54,915 --> 00:58:56,884
Come here.

1197
00:58:56,884 --> 00:58:57,751
Are you trying to tear of the name tag?

1198
00:58:57,785 --> 00:58:59,186
No, I'm not.

1199
00:58:59,220 --> 00:59:01,088
I just want to take off this.

1200
00:59:04,992 --> 00:59:07,027
No, you can't kneel down!

1201
00:59:07,061 --> 00:59:13,234
Hey, you! See what you did!

1202
00:59:14,201 --> 00:59:18,439
Jae Suk, please same my face.

1203
00:59:18,472 --> 00:59:19,039
Wait.

1204
00:59:19,073 --> 00:59:20,207
- Gwang Soo. - Jong Kook hyung. Let's eliminate him first.

1205
00:59:20,241 --> 00:59:23,210
- Eliminate Jong Kook hyung together.

1206
00:59:23,210 --> 00:59:26,113
I'll take care of him.

1207
00:59:26,180 --> 00:59:30,184
Tear off Gwang Soo's name tag, then we'll form the alliance.

1208
00:59:30,184 --> 00:59:31,418
Let's do that.

1209
00:59:31,452 --> 00:59:34,455
He is the betrayer anyway.

1210
00:59:34,488 --> 00:59:35,990
Take it off, take it off.

1211
00:59:35,990 --> 00:59:39,727
Sir, please remove his name tag.

1212
00:59:39,727 --> 00:59:41,962
He will be the one that tears off your name tag later.

1213
00:59:41,996 --> 00:59:43,230
I can't rip it.

1214
00:59:43,230 --> 00:59:45,833
Why not? Mine's already torn.

1215
00:59:45,866 --> 00:59:50,204
- Seriously, I'll work hard. Really! - You are not a bad child.

1216
00:59:50,237 --> 00:59:53,941
But, he's the betrayer. I'm telling you.

1217
00:59:56,110 --> 01:00:00,047
Gwang Soo will be the one that tears off your name tag, hyung.

1218
01:00:00,047 --> 01:00:01,649
I've been turning my back towards him all the awhile.

1219
01:00:01,682 --> 01:00:05,085
- But he hasn't torn mine? - He won't tear it now, he won't tear it now.

1220
01:00:05,119 --> 01:00:06,921
At the end, there's only one winner.

1221
01:00:06,921 --> 01:00:09,189
- Look, if he wanted to tear it he'd have done so earlier. - Of course.

1222
01:00:09,189 --> 01:00:10,658
I'll just let you off once.

1223
01:00:10,691 --> 01:00:11,625
- Yes. - Hyung, thank you.

1224
01:00:11,659 --> 01:00:12,726
Where are they?

1225
01:00:12,760 --> 01:00:14,161
- Upstairs. - Alright.

1226
01:00:15,829 --> 01:00:21,902
Hey. Let it go, let it go.

1227
01:00:21,936 --> 01:00:23,737
Hey, what are you doing?

1228
01:00:23,771 --> 01:00:27,975
You can't have high blood pressure, that's what I do.

1229
01:00:29,877 --> 01:00:32,413
I will do it.

1230
01:00:32,613 --> 01:00:34,548
Let's act it together.

1231
01:00:34,582 --> 01:00:35,916
1…2…3!

1232
01:00:35,950 --> 01:00:37,284
This, this… this… rude one!

1233
01:00:37,318 --> 01:00:47,561
This!

1234
01:00:47,595 --> 01:00:50,531
We'll see you later, hyungnim.

1235
01:00:51,398 --> 01:00:53,534
My blood pressure is really going up.

1236
01:00:53,567 --> 01:00:54,201
Oh!

1237
01:00:54,234 --> 01:00:57,404
Are you okay?

1238
01:01:00,107 --> 01:01:02,176
Let's ambush them.

1239
01:01:02,209 --> 01:01:05,346
We'll go down and find Jae Suk first.

1240
01:01:07,781 --> 01:01:09,416
Let's go now.

1241
01:01:09,783 --> 01:01:11,151
Let's go this way.

1242
01:01:11,185 --> 01:01:12,419
Oh.

1243
01:01:14,021 --> 01:01:18,659
Oh, you guys.

1244
01:01:18,659 --> 01:01:19,426
They went there.

1245
01:01:19,460 --> 01:01:20,794
- Who? - We're hiding now.

1246
01:01:20,828 --> 01:01:22,262
I know that too.

1247
01:01:22,262 --> 01:01:27,735
- Are you tearing it off? - No, no.

1248
01:01:27,768 --> 01:01:28,636
What are you doing?

1249
01:01:28,669 --> 01:01:30,604
How do we pass?

1250
01:01:30,604 --> 01:01:36,677
What's this?

1251
01:01:43,117 --> 01:01:44,118
Whose is it?

1252
01:01:44,151 --> 01:01:44,718
Whose is it?

1253
01:01:46,987 --> 01:01:47,821
Whose is it?

1254
01:01:47,855 --> 01:01:50,691
Whose is it?

1255
01:01:50,691 --> 01:01:53,127
- What are you doing? - Whose is it?

1256
01:01:53,127 --> 01:01:55,462
- Whose? - Yours, yours.

1257
01:01:55,462 --> 01:01:57,865
What are you doing?

1258
01:01:57,898 --> 01:01:59,166
What are you doing now?

1259
01:01:59,166 --> 01:02:05,973
This… Why is this so long?

1260
01:02:06,006 --> 01:02:11,412
You really caught a lot of fishes today?

1261
01:02:11,412 --> 01:02:15,683
But, we are together. Why was mine the one who got ripped off?

1262
01:02:21,321 --> 01:02:22,656
It's worse than the shark.

1263
01:02:22,690 --> 01:02:24,692
There's a shark?

1264
01:02:55,823 --> 01:02:57,691
Hyungnim was really scary.

1265
01:02:57,725 --> 01:03:01,195
Today is too funny.

1266
01:03:01,228 --> 01:03:07,401
- Why is your hand so weak? - I got my hand on it, but it won't come off.

1267
01:03:07,401 --> 01:03:10,738
Do you know how he was following them?

1268
01:03:10,738 --> 01:03:15,442
We usually follow them like this, but teacher was like this.

1269
01:03:15,442 --> 01:03:17,745
You…

1270
01:03:17,778 --> 01:03:20,347
Hey, hey. Stop it.

1271
01:03:33,927 --> 01:03:36,897
Hyung, I'm looking. You just stay here.

1272
01:03:36,897 --> 01:03:41,502
I'm looking and you are too…

1273
01:03:42,069 --> 01:03:46,707
He's lecturing his hyung too much.

1274
01:03:47,341 --> 01:03:53,280
I'm already looking and you still…

1275
01:03:53,313 --> 01:03:57,951
Let's go up first then come back down.

1276
01:04:07,461 --> 01:04:10,397
Stay where you are. Aren't I already looking?

1277
01:04:10,464 --> 01:04:12,733
I'm curious too!

1278
01:04:12,766 --> 01:04:16,436
If you are curious watch the broadcast.

1279
01:04:21,575 --> 01:04:23,677
Gary.

1280
01:04:23,710 --> 01:04:26,213
Gary?

1281
01:04:26,246 --> 01:04:30,050
Gary.

1282
01:04:32,085 --> 01:04:33,253
Gary?

1283
01:04:33,287 --> 01:04:39,159
But, is he keeping a dog in his house? He keeps on calling Gary Gary.

1284
01:04:39,193 --> 01:04:41,662
Gary is a person's name.

1285
01:04:42,996 --> 01:04:44,264
Gary.

1286
01:04:44,298 --> 01:04:45,566
Gary.

1287
01:04:45,632 --> 01:04:47,201
Gary.

1288
01:04:47,234 --> 01:04:49,002
Gary.

1289
01:04:49,002 --> 01:04:50,704
Gary?

1290
01:04:52,773 --> 01:04:57,644
What? Found them!

1291
01:04:57,644 --> 01:04:59,847
-I like you. -Hyungnim.

1292
01:04:59,880 --> 01:05:02,115
-Gary? -Chairman.

1293
01:05:02,149 --> 01:05:05,452
Chairman, how did you come in?

1294
01:05:05,485 --> 01:05:07,588
-Let's agree to rip one. -Hyungnim.

1295
01:05:07,621 --> 01:05:09,723
-So, let us... -Let's unite.

1296
01:05:09,756 --> 01:05:10,991
Just tear one.

1297
01:05:11,024 --> 01:05:11,892
I promise.

1298
01:05:11,892 --> 01:05:15,095
How can you do that? One person is not enough to attack.

1299
01:05:15,128 --> 01:05:19,266
If I tear yours, he can do it. If I tear him, you can do it.

1300
01:05:19,299 --> 01:05:23,403
Then... Do we need help later when finishing?

1301
01:05:23,403 --> 01:05:26,907
Of course, when we get there I'll be the king.

1302
01:05:26,940 --> 01:05:30,744
-Because you won't be able to do anything. Fruits won't catch anything. -I know.

1303
01:05:30,777 --> 01:05:33,247
I'm sure. We eat meat and then dessert.

1304
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:34,514
That's right.

1305
01:05:34,514 --> 01:05:36,083
I trust you guys.

1306
01:05:37,317 --> 01:05:39,019
I trust you guys.

1307
01:05:43,523 --> 01:05:44,691
I told you, I told you.

1308
01:05:44,725 --> 01:05:49,062
Tear mine, mine.

1309
01:05:49,062 --> 01:05:52,799
Let us just go now and if we meet again...

1310
01:05:52,799 --> 01:05:56,003
-There's no time. -There's no time.

1311
01:05:56,036 --> 01:05:59,606
-Teacher, let us off once please! -We just started over again now.

1312
01:05:59,606 --> 01:06:01,375
We have just started over again.

1313
01:06:01,408 --> 01:06:06,013
-She wanted to tear mine. -That's what I said. Don't be so soft-hearted anymore.

1314
01:06:06,013 --> 01:06:07,080
Is it usually like this?

1315
01:06:07,080 --> 01:06:11,251
I saw hyungnim earlier, when she's about to tear yours...

1316
01:06:11,285 --> 01:06:13,220
Is it usually like this?

1317
01:06:14,788 --> 01:06:19,126
-Let's settle this first, teacher. -Let's just tear off one. Just one.

1318
01:06:19,159 --> 01:06:21,662
Just use your strength, why are you so weak?

1319
01:06:21,695 --> 01:06:25,232
How could I use strength among us, let's just tear off his.

1320
01:06:39,212 --> 01:06:43,317
Why are you so scared?

1321
01:06:43,350 --> 01:06:46,286
-Let's play rock paper scissors for once. -Why?

1322
01:06:46,320 --> 01:06:47,754
To tear...

1323
01:06:47,788 --> 01:06:50,657
-Just do it cleanly? -We'll do it cleanly.

1324
01:06:50,691 --> 01:06:52,826
I'm tired to death.

1325
01:06:52,826 --> 01:06:53,927
Hey, tear it.

1326
01:06:53,961 --> 01:06:57,130
Hey, you. Why did you have to suggest that?

1327
01:06:57,164 --> 01:07:00,867
I wore too much layers.

1328
01:07:00,901 --> 01:07:04,104
-Hyung, you're even wearing long Johns? -He's not kidding.

1329
01:07:04,137 --> 01:07:05,839
I wear more...

1330
01:07:05,872 --> 01:07:09,176
He keeps saying he's tired.

1331
01:07:09,176 --> 01:07:12,913
Let's do rock paper scissors once.

1332
01:07:12,913 --> 01:07:14,081
I really.

1333
01:07:14,081 --> 01:07:15,215
-Moo ji ba. -Tear it off nearly?

1334
01:07:15,248 --> 01:07:18,785
Mook ji ba.

1335
01:07:18,785 --> 01:07:19,419
-You have keep your side of the bargain. -Of course.

1336
01:07:19,453 --> 01:07:21,121
Then just one person.

1337
01:07:21,121 --> 01:07:24,591
-Yours is the right hand. -Rock Paper Scissors!

1338
01:07:24,624 --> 01:07:25,325
Paper!

1339
01:07:25,359 --> 01:07:27,094
Rock!

1340
01:07:27,127 --> 01:07:30,964
Paper!

1341
01:07:30,998 --> 01:07:32,899
Scissors! Paper!

1342
01:07:32,899 --> 01:07:33,867
Rock!

1343
01:07:33,900 --> 01:07:36,236
Paper!

1344
01:07:36,503 --> 01:07:38,905
Paper!

1345
01:07:41,775 --> 01:07:43,143
Gwang Soo, go!

1346
01:07:49,049 --> 01:07:51,051
They're coming.

1347
01:07:51,051 --> 01:07:52,552
Behind, behind!

1348
01:08:03,597 --> 01:08:07,667
Why is it like this? Yoo Jae Suk is usually like this?

1349
01:08:12,739 --> 01:08:14,274
They're here.

1350
01:08:16,209 --> 01:08:18,045
Block them, block them.

1351
01:08:18,045 --> 01:08:22,282
-Hey, we are just left with one guy now! -Why?

1352
01:08:22,315 --> 01:08:25,118
I already got torn.

1353
01:08:25,152 --> 01:08:26,420
I'm already torn. You have to get Jae Suk's.

1354
01:08:26,453 --> 01:08:31,224
-He lost in rock paper scissors and still ran away. -Really?

1355
01:08:31,258 --> 01:08:33,293
We only have one person left.

1356
01:08:33,326 --> 01:08:35,162
Look at Sang Myun's face.

1357
01:08:35,195 --> 01:08:36,696
Jae Suk was too despicable!

1358
01:08:36,696 --> 01:08:40,500
We agreed that the loser would be torn but he just ran off.

1359
01:08:40,500 --> 01:08:42,035
Joung Kook.

1360
01:08:42,069 --> 01:08:44,071
-Joung Kook. -What are you doing?

1361
01:08:44,071 --> 01:08:45,572
What are you doing?

1362
01:08:45,605 --> 01:08:48,341
We're waiting for you.

1363
01:08:49,543 --> 01:08:51,878
Let's go up first.

1364
01:08:51,912 --> 01:08:53,914
What are you guys doing?

1365
01:08:53,914 --> 01:08:55,816
We were waiting here.

1366
01:08:55,816 --> 01:08:58,919
Where did Jae Suk go?

1367
01:08:58,952 --> 01:09:00,253
We tore Gary's.

1368
01:09:00,287 --> 01:09:02,622
You got Gary's?

1369
01:09:02,656 --> 01:09:04,291
Let's work together and tear off Jae Suk hyung's?

1370
01:09:04,291 --> 01:09:08,595
-They're coming. -Jae Suk hyung.

1371
01:09:08,595 --> 01:09:10,163
Hey Gary, block him.

1372
01:09:10,163 --> 01:09:10,864
Block him.

1373
01:09:10,897 --> 01:09:12,899
This won't do, Jae Suk.

1374
01:09:12,899 --> 01:09:16,870
Lock the door. Block him.

1375
01:09:16,870 --> 01:09:20,073
Hey, I'll do it, I'll use my strength.

1376
01:09:20,073 --> 01:09:23,810
-I'll use my strength. -These guys have no strength.

1377
01:09:23,877 --> 01:09:29,249
Hey, come in.

1378
01:09:29,282 --> 01:09:31,051
Hyungnim, come here!

1379
01:09:31,051 --> 01:09:32,352
Hyungnim, come here quickly!

1380
01:09:32,385 --> 01:09:39,659
They don't have loyalty.

1381
01:09:39,693 --> 01:09:41,394
They're going to run again.

1382
01:09:41,428 --> 01:09:42,729
They might run away again.

1383
01:09:42,762 --> 01:09:47,100
Wait, wait.

1384
01:09:47,100 --> 01:09:48,802
Jae Suk hyung! Wait, wait!

1385
01:09:48,802 --> 01:09:51,505
-Hey, come in! -Wait! Jae Suk hyung!

1386
01:09:51,538 --> 01:09:54,374
That's not it.

1387
01:09:56,877 --> 01:10:02,749
Jae Suk hyung's not ripped.

1388
01:10:02,782 --> 01:10:03,884
What about this guy?

1389
01:10:03,884 --> 01:10:05,452
Only the tail's ripped.

1390
01:10:05,452 --> 01:10:09,489
This is so weird, what's this?

1391
01:10:09,489 --> 01:10:11,191
Let's hurry and finish the Mook-Jji-Ba.

1392
01:10:11,191 --> 01:10:15,262
But, playing mookjjippa doesn't make sense.

1393
01:10:15,262 --> 01:10:16,663
There's still one try left.

1394
01:10:16,663 --> 01:10:18,832
-Hey, our four teams should rip off Joung Kook team together. -That's right.

1395
01:10:18,832 --> 01:10:20,767
-Please lead the way, chairman. - No, hyung.

1396
01:10:20,767 --> 01:10:24,804
-Chairman, chairman. -We have to tear off one of theirs.

1397
01:10:24,838 --> 01:10:26,773
They are traitors. We have to tear one too.

1398
01:10:26,773 --> 01:10:33,346
-Chairman! Chairman! -They are traitors.

1399
01:10:33,380 --> 01:10:35,215
They are really traitors.

1400
01:10:42,589 --> 01:10:44,391
Done! This is it!

1401
01:10:44,391 --> 01:10:46,193
Yeah, chairman.

1402
01:10:46,193 --> 01:10:48,962
-This will work too, this will work too. -Chairman, chairman.

1403
01:10:48,962 --> 01:10:52,599
Ok, let's do it fairly now.

1404
01:10:52,632 --> 01:10:56,469
Ok, from now on, we'll catch Jong Kook.

1405
01:10:56,503 --> 01:10:57,904
Jong Kook.

1406
01:10:57,938 --> 01:10:58,538
Hyung.

1407
01:10:58,572 --> 01:11:02,409
I can't hear! I cannot hear you, hyung. I can't hear you.

1408
01:11:02,409 --> 01:11:04,277
Joon Gyu!

1409
01:11:04,311 --> 01:11:05,912
I can't hear you!

1410
01:11:05,946 --> 01:11:07,047
I can't hear you.

1411
01:11:13,486 --> 01:11:14,621
Jeez, we won't hear it.

1412
01:11:14,654 --> 01:11:16,756
Let me see, what are yours?

1413
01:11:16,790 --> 01:11:17,924
What is it?

1414
01:11:17,924 --> 01:11:19,426
-I won't tear it. -A shark, a shark.

1415
01:11:19,492 --> 01:11:20,327
Oh.

1416
01:11:20,327 --> 01:11:22,562
How can only the tall came off?

1417
01:11:22,562 --> 01:11:25,265
The camera's filming that way, they may be there.

1418
01:11:25,298 --> 01:11:27,300
Hey, don't act like you're very sharp.

1419
01:11:27,334 --> 01:11:28,835
You're not going to, right?

1420
01:11:28,868 --> 01:11:30,070
We won't tear.

1421
01:11:30,070 --> 01:11:31,338
I don't believe you.

1422
01:11:31,371 --> 01:11:32,539
-What's the matter with you? -Jeez, hyung.

1423
01:11:32,572 --> 01:11:33,807
Hey, you really can't be like this.

1424
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:34,874
Jae Suk hyung can't tear anymore.

1425
01:11:34,874 --> 01:11:36,243
I can't tear anything.

1426
01:11:36,243 --> 01:11:37,677
So what was that earlier?

1427
01:11:37,677 --> 01:11:40,380
Why are we walking around so noisily?

1428
01:11:42,015 --> 01:11:44,184
That shocked me.

1429
01:11:44,217 --> 01:11:46,186
Do you still want to tear this off?

1430
01:11:46,219 --> 01:11:47,087
What?

1431
01:11:47,087 --> 01:11:49,389
Nothing's wrong, it's fine.

1432
01:11:49,422 --> 01:11:52,292
Your hand can't reach your back?

1433
01:11:52,325 --> 01:11:53,860
See if there's anyone in the toilet.

1434
01:11:53,860 --> 01:11:55,662
Where are you going?

1435
01:11:55,662 --> 01:11:56,263
They're here!

1436
01:11:56,263 --> 01:11:57,731
Hey, they're here, they're here.

1437
01:11:57,764 --> 01:12:00,133
-Here, here. -Catch them!

1438
01:12:01,635 --> 01:12:03,670
Catch them!

1439
01:12:05,338 --> 01:12:08,041
Don't tear it!

1440
01:12:28,662 --> 01:12:30,397
-Didn't I say so? -Hey.

1441
01:12:30,430 --> 01:12:34,401
-This place is full of betrayal, betrayal. -Gwang Soo, this fellow...

1442
01:12:34,434 --> 01:12:36,603
Look at this, this.

1443
01:12:36,636 --> 01:12:40,006
Didn't I say so?

1444
01:12:49,382 --> 01:12:53,887
If we don't do this quickly, there will ebe no winner.

1445
01:12:55,355 --> 01:12:58,091
Gwang Soo, help me scratch here.

1446
01:12:58,124 --> 01:12:59,426
Oh, that's it.

1447
01:12:59,459 --> 01:13:02,028
Oh, but the clothes are too thick.

1448
01:13:02,028 --> 01:13:03,596
A little higher.

1449
01:13:03,596 --> 01:13:06,633
Right there. Put your hand in, scratch.

1450
01:13:06,666 --> 01:13:08,735
I'm going crazy. Hang on.

1451
01:13:08,768 --> 01:13:10,770
I'll loosen it.

1452
01:13:10,770 --> 01:13:12,972
You know this feeling, right?

1453
01:13:12,972 --> 01:13:15,342
Gwang Soo, do it quickly.

1454
01:13:15,375 --> 01:13:18,044
-Jeez, really. -Come here quickly.

1455
01:13:18,078 --> 01:13:20,847
-Hyung's style is to really troublesome. -Higher.

1456
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:21,614
A little higher, higher.

1457
01:13:21,648 --> 01:13:25,185
-Scratch it, scratch it. -Why are you sweating so much?

1458
01:13:25,218 --> 01:13:26,653
Oh there, there.

1459
01:13:26,686 --> 01:13:28,555
A bit higher, higher, higher.

1460
01:13:28,555 --> 01:13:29,889
A little to the side.

1461
01:13:29,923 --> 01:13:32,892
To this side!

1462
01:13:32,926 --> 01:13:39,632
A little higher.

1463
01:13:39,666 --> 01:13:41,935
Oh there, there.

1464
01:13:51,945 --> 01:13:53,446
Come here, come here.

1465
01:13:53,446 --> 01:13:54,180
Hang on for a moment.

1466
01:13:54,214 --> 01:13:59,919
We'll just, confront them. We'll run over and I'll catch them.

1467
01:13:59,953 --> 01:14:03,656
As long as we sacrifice once the others can get first.

1468
01:14:03,690 --> 01:14:08,428
Just pass them by naturally and pretend we don't know anything.

1469
01:14:12,465 --> 01:14:15,635
They're coming, sit down, sit down.

1470
01:14:41,327 --> 01:14:42,295
I'll go in front.

1471
01:14:42,328 --> 01:14:47,233
I...I can't do it.

1472
01:14:47,267 --> 01:14:48,067
I can't do it.

1473
01:14:48,101 --> 01:14:50,970
Is this plan a good one?

1474
01:14:51,004 --> 01:14:54,541
Hurry! I'm supposed to block, right?

1475
01:14:54,574 --> 01:14:56,676
-Hey, hurry with this. -Can't you even do this?

1476
01:14:56,709 --> 01:14:57,677
No, I'm blocking, catch him.

1477
01:14:57,677 --> 01:14:59,312
Catch him quickly.

1478
01:14:59,312 --> 01:15:01,581
Hey, aren't I blocking him?

1479
01:15:01,581 --> 01:15:03,082
What's with Park Joon Gyu, tear Park Joon Gyu's off!

1480
01:15:03,082 --> 01:15:05,718
Hyung, grab this side, this side.

1481
01:15:10,557 --> 01:15:11,191
The bracelet, he bracelet.

1482
01:15:11,224 --> 01:15:12,459
-Where is your bracelet? -The bracelet.

1483
01:15:12,459 --> 01:15:13,159
-The bracelet. -The bracelet.

1484
01:15:13,193 --> 01:15:17,464
The bracelet, out! The bracelet. They're out!

1485
01:15:28,541 --> 01:15:30,477
Hey, let's go!

1486
01:15:32,078 --> 01:15:34,747
I didn't foresee this.

1487
01:15:37,050 --> 01:15:39,285
I knew it'd be like this.

1488
01:15:47,961 --> 01:15:49,162
-Hang on. -Aigoo.

1489
01:15:49,195 --> 01:15:50,563
This is the jail.

1490
01:15:50,563 --> 01:15:51,764
Yours was torn?

1491
01:15:51,798 --> 01:15:53,466
It was torn off earlier.

1492
01:15:53,500 --> 01:15:55,535
I will only tell you both.

1493
01:15:55,568 --> 01:15:57,437
Gwang Soo's a jerk, make a call.

1494
01:15:57,470 --> 01:15:58,771
He's always been that kind of person.

1495
01:15:58,805 --> 01:16:01,074
-No, he's the worst. -No, I begged hyung but you wouldn't listen.

1496
01:16:01,107 --> 01:16:03,476
When I was watching it...

1497
01:16:03,510 --> 01:16:09,482
"They're doing that intentionally for laughs." That's what I thought.

1498
01:16:09,482 --> 01:16:11,584
-When I come and see for myself... -That's why, hyung.

1499
01:16:11,618 --> 01:16:15,221
-It's really savage! - I even threw up the last time at Gyeonghee Palace.

1500
01:16:15,255 --> 01:16:16,189
Why?

1501
01:16:16,222 --> 01:16:18,791
I just ran around the interior and exterior of Gyeonghee Palace.

1502
01:16:18,825 --> 01:16:20,360
I didn't know what I was doing.

1503
01:16:20,393 --> 01:16:21,761
I just ran wildly.

1504
01:16:21,794 --> 01:16:25,331
-Hey, apparently Min Soo came again because he was too angry. -Yes, I've also heard that.

1505
01:16:25,331 --> 01:16:27,033
It's worth coming again.

1506
01:16:27,066 --> 01:16:27,934
I must come again next time.

1507
01:16:27,967 --> 01:16:29,502
We'll just come together with Min Soo hyung.

1508
01:16:29,536 --> 01:16:33,006
I thought I could just go, "Hey, come here!"

1509
01:16:33,006 --> 01:16:36,509
And that would do.

1510
01:16:36,543 --> 01:16:37,710
"Yes... ah yes, hyung", just like this?

1511
01:16:37,710 --> 01:16:40,547
I was planning to for a 3 set if I met Jong Kook hyung.

1512
01:16:40,547 --> 01:16:41,047
Shall we try it?

1513
01:16:41,047 --> 01:16:43,583
-The fist time. -We'll meet face to face.

1514
01:16:43,583 --> 01:16:45,184
-Jong Kook. - We've met.

1515
01:16:45,218 --> 01:16:46,853
Jong Kook.

1516
01:16:46,853 --> 01:16:48,121
Let me tear one.

1517
01:16:48,121 --> 01:16:50,023
Jeez, you can't do this on the show.

1518
01:16:50,056 --> 01:16:51,057
This guy!

1519
01:16:51,090 --> 01:16:52,825
Let me tear one!

1520
01:16:52,825 --> 01:16:54,460
I said you can't.

1521
01:16:54,527 --> 01:16:56,796
Oh, oh!

1522
01:16:56,829 --> 01:17:00,366
Ohm oh. Hey, hey.

1523
01:17:00,400 --> 01:17:02,335
Oh, tear it, tear it.

1524
01:17:02,335 --> 01:17:05,171
Haha, there's medicine in my left pocket.

1525
01:17:05,238 --> 01:17:05,772
We wanted to do this.

1526
01:17:05,805 --> 01:17:08,908
Hey, it's not bad.

1527
01:17:10,877 --> 01:17:13,046
Hey, you guys came at the right time.

1528
01:17:13,079 --> 01:17:14,113
-Feel. -Feel.

1529
01:17:14,113 --> 01:17:16,449
Cross.

1530
01:17:16,482 --> 01:17:18,585
What's this, who are you teaming with?

1531
01:17:18,618 --> 01:17:20,553
Are you jealous, hyung?

1532
01:17:20,553 --> 01:17:21,220
One more time.

1533
01:17:21,220 --> 01:17:23,656
-Myeon. -Sang.

1534
01:17:27,193 --> 01:17:28,928
Let's tear Ji Hyo noona's off together.

1535
01:17:28,962 --> 01:17:29,963
You hang on.

1536
01:17:29,996 --> 01:17:31,764
She's a girl so let her off.

1537
01:17:31,798 --> 01:17:35,535
If it's a 1-on-1 it's going to difficult to use strength.

1538
01:17:35,568 --> 01:17:37,337
Right, but how can we use strength on Ji Hyo?

1539
01:17:37,370 --> 01:17:40,907
-That's right. They're only left with one. -I feel Ji Hyo's too pretty, I can't even get close to her.

1540
01:17:40,940 --> 01:17:43,676
-One team will lure her, the other... -He's totally fallen for Ji Hyo.

1541
01:17:43,710 --> 01:17:44,577
Is that so?

1542
01:17:44,611 --> 01:17:47,213
Actually his heart has been leaning towards Ji Hyo.

1543
01:17:47,580 --> 01:17:49,482
Hey, do you think it will work out?

1544
01:17:49,515 --> 01:17:52,652
Hey, can't I like her in my heart?!

1545
01:17:52,685 --> 01:17:55,755
-In my heart... -Hyung, what's this about loving in your heart?

1546
01:17:55,755 --> 01:17:58,358
We're filming now.

1547
01:17:58,358 --> 01:18:00,093
You're saying you love her.

1548
01:18:00,093 --> 01:18:00,994
It's no longer a love in your heart.

1549
01:18:00,994 --> 01:18:04,297
Liking her in my heart can also be like loving my mother.

1550
01:18:04,330 --> 01:18:05,498
Why do you even bother about things like this?

1551
01:18:05,531 --> 01:18:06,733
-Even if it's loving your mother... -What do you mean bother?

1552
01:18:06,766 --> 01:18:08,935
Hey, you should protect what you have to.

1553
01:18:08,935 --> 01:18:13,039
-But, as Song Ji Hyuo's fan I can also like her as an actress. -Well, that could be.

1554
01:18:13,039 --> 01:18:14,707
Why do these issues of mine have to be...

1555
01:18:14,741 --> 01:18:17,310
Hey, should I break this?

1556
01:18:17,343 --> 01:18:20,113
-This won't do. -Did I say something I shouldn't have?

1557
01:18:20,113 --> 01:18:22,749
But what Myeon Sang hyung said was right.

1558
01:18:22,782 --> 01:18:24,417
Hyung, we'll leave first.

1559
01:18:24,450 --> 01:18:25,985
I got it.

1560
01:18:27,086 --> 01:18:29,288
Gary.

1561
01:18:29,288 --> 01:18:30,823
Are you here?

1562
01:18:31,190 --> 01:18:34,894
They're here, they're in here.

1563
01:18:34,927 --> 01:18:37,130
Hey, Gwang Soo's a really poisonous snake.

1564
01:18:37,163 --> 01:18:39,666
If he's given half a chance...

1565
01:18:39,699 --> 01:18:42,101
-Be careful of Gwang Soo. -Jong Kook's strength is really great.

1566
01:18:45,905 --> 01:18:48,174
How can you guys be so cocky?

1567
01:18:59,752 --> 01:19:01,921
Let's just use one floor and then disperse?

1568
01:19:01,954 --> 01:19:03,189
-Let's disperse. -We'll just use one floor.

1569
01:19:03,222 --> 01:19:06,492
-We'll just use the first and second floor. -Right!

1570
01:19:06,526 --> 01:19:08,828
We'll just use this floor.

1571
01:19:08,828 --> 01:19:10,430
-A battle to the end. -Ok.

1572
01:19:10,430 --> 01:19:11,864
Start. One.

1573
01:19:11,898 --> 01:19:17,070
Two, three, four, five, six.

1574
01:19:17,070 --> 01:19:19,005
Seven.

1575
01:19:19,839 --> 01:19:21,607
We'll just grab that and tear it off.

1576
01:19:21,641 --> 01:19:23,609
Ten.

1577
01:19:26,279 --> 01:19:28,548
I'm going to tear it off.

1578
01:19:28,581 --> 01:19:30,883
Omo. Omo, omo.

1579
01:19:36,989 --> 01:19:40,426
What are the four of you doing?

1580
01:19:40,460 --> 01:19:41,828
I can't tear, I can't tear.

1581
01:19:41,861 --> 01:19:43,329
Oppa, catch them quickly.

1582
01:19:43,362 --> 01:19:44,864
Catch them.

1583
01:19:44,897 --> 01:19:46,966
Catch them. Oppa, you can catch them.

1584
01:19:52,572 --> 01:19:55,508
Ji Hyo! That's it, that's it.

1585
01:19:55,541 --> 01:19:56,976
It's only the tail.

1586
01:19:57,009 --> 01:20:03,082
The head is here!

1587
01:20:03,116 --> 01:20:04,784
Match it first.

1588
01:20:04,817 --> 01:20:06,352
Match it, match it.

1589
01:20:06,352 --> 01:20:10,156
It's right, it's right.

1590
01:20:12,058 --> 01:20:14,026
Hey, Ji Hyo.

1591
01:20:14,060 --> 01:20:14,827
What?

1592
01:20:14,861 --> 01:20:15,628
Sunbae, I love you.

1593
01:20:15,628 --> 01:20:16,429
What do you mean love?

1594
01:20:16,462 --> 01:20:18,464
Sunbae, I love you.

1595
01:20:19,499 --> 01:20:20,900
Hyung, 10 seconds?

1596
01:20:20,933 --> 01:20:23,035
-10 seconds? -Ok.

1597
01:20:23,069 --> 01:20:24,170
Where do we go?

1598
01:20:24,203 --> 01:20:26,672
-We'll go this way, -Right, we'll go this way.

1599
01:20:27,206 --> 01:20:29,842
Ok, one...

1600
01:20:37,283 --> 01:20:38,785
Yeah!

1601
01:20:42,088 --> 01:20:43,523
Thanks.

1602
01:20:43,890 --> 01:20:44,891
Am I really out?

1603
01:20:44,924 --> 01:20:46,459
Then what do I do?

1604
01:20:47,927 --> 01:20:49,295
Ok, one...

1605
01:20:57,436 --> 01:20:58,671
Hey, what's with you? Hey!

1606
01:20:58,704 --> 01:20:59,972
Hey, what's with you?

1607
01:20:59,972 --> 01:21:02,074
-Hey. -Hey, what's with you?

1608
01:21:02,074 --> 01:21:03,309
You kept betraying others!

1609
01:21:03,342 --> 01:21:05,278
Hey really, you're seriously... -Hey.

1610
01:21:05,311 --> 01:21:09,015
Hey, Song Ji Hyo.

1611
01:21:09,048 --> 01:21:11,250
Let's flight it out!

1612
01:21:11,250 --> 01:21:12,985
Gwang Soo, Gwang Soo.

1613
01:21:13,019 --> 01:21:15,288
Gwang Soo.

1614
01:21:38,477 --> 01:21:40,780
It's raining so heavily and it's so cold.

1615
01:21:40,813 --> 01:21:43,783
How do we fish?

1616
01:21:45,117 --> 01:21:47,220
-From now, the time limit given is one hour. -Ok.

1617
01:21:47,253 --> 01:21:51,224
Within one hour, the team that catches the biggest fish wins.

1618
01:21:51,257 --> 01:21:52,391
The species doesn't matter.

1619
01:21:52,420 --> 01:21:53,426
The species doesn't matter.

1620
01:23:03,429 --> 01:23:05,298
Oh, what is it?

1621
01:23:05,298 --> 01:23:07,266
Ok, everyone come over to this side, everyone to this side.

1622
01:23:07,266 --> 01:23:08,134
What is it?

1623
01:23:08,167 --> 01:23:11,771
Ok, all fishermen come over here quickly.

1624
01:23:11,804 --> 01:23:14,974
We're not fishermen, we're Running Men.

1625
01:23:16,442 --> 01:23:18,210
He fished for half a century.

1626
01:23:18,244 --> 01:23:22,348
There are 50,000 excuses for not being able to fish anything.

1627
01:23:22,381 --> 01:23:24,250
Teachers caught a shrimp.

1628
01:23:24,250 --> 01:23:26,385
But five would be enough.

1629
01:23:26,385 --> 01:23:27,787
But this is real today.

1630
01:23:27,820 --> 01:23:31,457
It rained suddenly so the water temperature dropped.

1631
01:23:31,490 --> 01:23:34,527
-I'll just let you see it. -What is it?

1632
01:23:34,560 --> 01:23:37,630
If you had won today...

1633
01:23:38,164 --> 01:23:40,833
So what do we do, about the golden hook?

1634
01:23:40,866 --> 01:23:44,203
Today, because there was no winner, we won't be giving out the prize.

1635
01:23:44,236 --> 01:23:45,604
Of course.

1636
01:23:45,604 --> 01:23:48,107
-All of you today... -Take good care of it.

1637
01:23:48,140 --> 01:23:50,576
Next time.

1638
01:23:50,609 --> 01:23:55,614
Well for me, I don't know if it will be six months...

1639
01:23:55,614 --> 01:23:58,217
Or maybe even three months if it's urgent.

1640
01:23:58,217 --> 01:24:00,353
-If I come again... -It's fine.

1641
01:24:00,386 --> 01:24:01,320
You're coming again?

1642
01:24:06,959 --> 01:24:09,695
We haven't had a situation with no winner.

1643
01:24:09,729 --> 01:24:12,264
No winners today. Hey, we have to remember this.

1644
01:24:12,264 --> 01:24:14,967
Let's give our hyungs a round of applause.

1645
01:24:23,542 --> 01:24:24,710
No!

1646
01:24:29,915 --> 01:24:31,317
Is there anyone?

1647
01:24:31,617 --> 01:24:32,785
Here!

1648
01:24:33,185 --> 01:24:34,687
Open the door!

1649
01:24:34,720 --> 01:24:36,856
Why am I here?

1650
01:24:37,790 --> 01:24:40,192
Never give up hope!

1651
01:24:43,462 --> 01:24:46,098
Fugitive 1 has escaped.

1652
01:24:50,202 --> 01:24:51,704
I've finally returned after a year.

1653
01:24:51,704 --> 01:24:54,206
A water gun.
