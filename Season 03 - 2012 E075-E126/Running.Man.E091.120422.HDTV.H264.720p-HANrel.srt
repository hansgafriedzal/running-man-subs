1
00:00:08,592 --> 00:00:10,561
Is there no one at all?

2
00:00:11,362 --> 00:00:12,697
Here!

3
00:00:13,197 --> 00:00:14,532
Save me!

4
00:00:14,532 --> 00:00:16,033
Open the door!

5
00:00:16,033 --> 00:00:18,002
Why am l here?

6
00:00:22,473 --> 00:00:24,442
I know a secret!

7
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:28,045
I'm finally back after a year.

8
00:00:51,535 --> 00:00:53,938
Why did you call me out at such a time at night?

9
00:00:54,739 --> 00:00:55,973
Anytime now.

10
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:57,508
Huh?

11
00:00:57,508 --> 00:00:58,943
You will know.

12
00:01:00,211 --> 00:01:02,346
Where are all of them?

13
00:01:11,422 --> 00:01:13,190
Today, it’s strange.

14
00:01:14,725 --> 00:01:16,093
What's this?

15
00:01:16,093 --> 00:01:18,095
Why did you call me out so late?

16
00:01:23,367 --> 00:01:25,703
Will someone come to pick me?

17
00:01:27,838 --> 00:01:29,540
What are we doing?

18
00:02:10,781 --> 00:02:12,149
They'll come, right?

19
00:02:15,686 --> 00:02:17,221
Is it a horror special?

20
00:02:30,534 --> 00:02:31,802
What?

21
00:02:32,369 --> 00:02:33,771
Myeok PD, you again.

22
00:02:34,438 --> 00:02:35,673
Arrest him.

23
00:02:35,773 --> 00:02:36,440
Arrest him.

24
00:02:37,041 --> 00:02:38,642
What?

25
00:02:40,411 --> 00:02:42,713
Hang on. Why are you arresting me?

26
00:02:43,247 --> 00:02:44,515
Huh?

27
00:02:47,451 --> 00:02:49,653
Myeok PD, why am I arrested?

28
00:02:49,653 --> 00:02:51,255
I'm now...

29
00:02:51,255 --> 00:02:52,656
No, Hyung Taek.

30
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:54,425
I'm seriously...

31
00:02:55,259 --> 00:02:57,828
We all know each other, keep your cool.

32
00:02:57,828 --> 00:03:01,098
Well, it's not even the first time. I've been a Spy once...

33
00:03:01,132 --> 00:03:02,533
What are you doing?

34
00:03:07,938 --> 00:03:09,540
-Mr Yoo Jae Suk. -Yes.

35
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:14,912
Mr Yoo Jae Suk, has made people embarrassed with his tight pants.

36
00:03:14,912 --> 00:03:16,747
You're also wearing them today.

37
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:19,884
-You've committed disorderly conduct. -Wow, I'm really...

38
00:03:19,884 --> 00:03:22,653
And not just being obsessed with the colour green,

39
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:27,958
you've committed a crime for an obsess/on over perfection that makes people weary.

40
00:03:28,259 --> 00:03:28,926
So?

41
00:03:29,059 --> 00:03:32,530
-According to the Running Law, Article 14, Line 1... -How is there Running Man Law?

42
00:03:32,663 --> 00:03:36,233
-Hey, do you really want me to grab your collar? -you aren't allowed to plead the Fifth Amendment.

43
00:03:36,267 --> 00:03:37,568
I can't?

44
00:03:37,601 --> 00:03:40,704
Starting from now, anything you say can and will be used against you.

45
00:03:40,938 --> 00:03:41,872
-What did you say? -Understand?

46
00:03:42,039 --> 00:03:42,706
So?

47
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:44,808
What do you want from me now?

48
00:03:44,842 --> 00:03:45,943
-Ok, move him. -But, I...

49
00:03:46,043 --> 00:03:48,245
Listen to what I have to say.

50
00:03:48,345 --> 00:03:49,346
But, my pants...

51
00:03:49,446 --> 00:03:51,682
Where are you taking me? Hey.

52
00:03:51,782 --> 00:03:54,351
Hey, where am I going?

53
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:56,887
What's this again?

54
00:04:00,991 --> 00:04:02,526
I'm going crazy.

55
00:04:04,762 --> 00:04:06,297
What's going on today?

56
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:07,898
Huh?

57
00:04:08,732 --> 00:04:10,935
What crime did I commit, according to what law?

58
00:04:11,068 --> 00:04:11,969
The Running Law.

59
00:04:12,069 --> 00:04:15,005
What Running Law, how is there a Running Law?

60
00:04:16,173 --> 00:04:17,841
Where are we going?

61
00:04:18,309 --> 00:04:19,910
To catch the other criminals.

62
00:04:21,912 --> 00:04:23,547
I'm seriously...

63
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:28,619
What will it be? What will it be?

64
00:04:29,286 --> 00:04:30,521
Why did they call us out so late at night?

65
00:04:30,621 --> 00:04:32,122
Are they filming a scary show?

66
00:04:39,797 --> 00:04:41,999
What? What?

67
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:43,934
Arrest him.

68
00:04:44,068 --> 00:04:46,704
Why? Why me? I didn't do anything wrong, hang on.

69
00:04:47,404 --> 00:04:48,572
Why, why?

70
00:04:48,672 --> 00:04:50,441
I didn't do anything wrong!

71
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:53,143
Why? I didn't do anything. Why are you doing this?

72
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:55,012
It's so scary.

73
00:05:00,017 --> 00:05:01,418
-Mr HaHa. -Yes.

74
00:05:01,518 --> 00:05:04,121
During this period, each time female guests appeared...

75
00:05:04,922 --> 00:05:08,792
-you would display your playboy act that humiliated Running Man. -No, I loved them!

76
00:05:08,926 --> 00:05:10,094
I really loved them.

77
00:05:10,227 --> 00:05:11,128
You just said you admitted it.

78
00:05:11,228 --> 00:05:12,563
-No, I loved them! -For now...

79
00:05:12,696 --> 00:05:15,332
-Mr HaHa is arrested for the crime of playboy act. -No!

80
00:05:15,432 --> 00:05:18,535
-I loved them! Son Ye Jin's my woman. -According to the Running Man Law, Arficie 14, Line 1...

81
00:05:18,636 --> 00:05:19,937
Ha Ji Won's my woman.

82
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,505
-Suzy... -You aren't allowed to plead the Fifth Amendment.

83
00:05:21,605 --> 00:05:23,641
Why? I want to call my lawyer.

84
00:05:23,741 --> 00:05:27,911
-Anything you say can and will be used against you. -I came from law family.

85
00:05:28,012 --> 00:05:29,413
I know the chief judge.

86
00:05:29,513 --> 00:05:31,782
-Take him away. -Let me make a call.

87
00:05:31,882 --> 00:05:33,384
After I make the call it’s the end for you!

88
00:05:33,851 --> 00:05:35,052
Do you know who I am?

89
00:05:35,686 --> 00:05:37,421
I, can make you...

90
00:05:40,824 --> 00:05:42,393
Do you know who I am?

91
00:05:42,493 --> 00:05:43,861
I’m an important person!

92
00:05:43,994 --> 00:05:45,663
Come in, come in.

93
00:05:45,796 --> 00:05:47,564
-Jae Suk hyung. -Time Controller.

94
00:05:47,698 --> 00:05:49,600
Space Controller, what's all this?

95
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:51,068
Please give me your phones.

96
00:05:51,201 --> 00:05:52,236
-What? -Give me your phones.

97
00:05:52,369 --> 00:05:53,504
I don't have one.

98
00:05:53,871 --> 00:05:55,506
It's here.

99
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:58,609
- It's here. - This is a gift from the Thai fans.

100
00:05:58,742 --> 00:06:00,811
This cubic can't be lost, this.

101
00:06:01,845 --> 00:06:03,580
You can't lose any cubic.

102
00:06:03,681 --> 00:06:05,316
This is a present from the Thai fans...

103
00:06:13,891 --> 00:06:14,892
Oh?

104
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:18,162
Why is he standing there wearing a coat?

105
00:06:18,996 --> 00:06:20,831
What's this again?

106
00:06:21,865 --> 00:06:23,634
-Arrest him. -What are you doing?

107
00:06:23,734 --> 00:06:25,369
What are you doing?

108
00:06:25,502 --> 00:06:27,705
No, what are you doing?

109
00:06:28,072 --> 00:06:30,040
Have they ever told you when you ask what's going on?

110
00:06:30,307 --> 00:06:31,842
You're just caught.

111
00:06:32,409 --> 00:06:33,510
You're arrested for the crime of abuse.

112
00:06:33,644 --> 00:06:34,745
What crime?

113
00:06:34,912 --> 00:06:38,115
This is based on a tip-off from Mr Park Joon Gyu, the crime of abuse.

114
00:06:38,248 --> 00:06:40,250
What's all this?

115
00:06:40,351 --> 00:06:44,421
Also, the crime of overreacting whenever Yoo Eon Hye is mentioned. The Yoon Eun Hye crime.

116
00:06:44,555 --> 00:06:46,523
How can there be a Yoon Eun Hye crime?

117
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:47,791
-Do you agree? -What?

118
00:06:47,925 --> 00:06:50,761
-Get on. -Agree... you just asked if I agreed?

119
00:06:50,861 --> 00:06:52,162
-What did you say? -Your handphone.

120
00:06:52,262 --> 00:06:53,297
I'm seriously...

121
00:06:54,031 --> 00:06:54,965
There's still one more right?

122
00:06:55,099 --> 00:06:57,101
No! There isn't!

123
00:06:57,234 --> 00:06:58,268
Hey, seriously.

124
00:06:59,136 --> 00:07:00,237
Wow, you're nasty.

125
00:07:00,371 --> 00:07:01,405
What's this, really?

126
00:07:01,505 --> 00:07:03,540
-Just get in first, Jong Kook. -Oh, hyung!

127
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,042
Hyung, why were you caught?

128
00:07:05,209 --> 00:07:06,910
What else could it be? What crime did you commit?

129
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:10,080
-What crime did hyung get? -You have too much muscle? - No.

130
00:07:10,381 --> 00:07:11,281
What then?

131
00:07:11,382 --> 00:07:12,549
Yoon Eun Hye crime.

132
00:07:12,649 --> 00:07:13,751
Yoon Eun Hye crime.

133
00:07:13,851 --> 00:07:15,252
What's all this?

134
00:07:15,386 --> 00:07:18,122
Hyung is guilty of disorderly conduct, because of his skinny jeans.

135
00:07:18,155 --> 00:07:21,525
Because of the skinny jeans they said it's a disorderly conduct.

136
00:07:23,927 --> 00:07:25,262
Something's coming?

137
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:26,663
- Arrest him. - Hang on.

138
00:07:26,797 --> 00:07:28,599
Why are you doing this?

139
00:07:28,732 --> 00:07:29,600
Why?

140
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,535
You're ugly, right?

141
00:07:31,635 --> 00:07:32,836
No!

142
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:35,072
You've committed the Ugly Guy crime,

143
00:07:35,205 --> 00:07:37,207
-Huh? -you have to come with us.

144
00:07:37,341 --> 00:07:38,509
Why, I'm...

145
00:07:38,642 --> 00:07:40,511
According to the Running Man Law, Section 14, Line 1...

146
00:07:40,611 --> 00:07:43,046
How can you charge someone because of his looks?

147
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:45,449
In my family I'm the most handsome!

148
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,355
Gary, what's your crime?

149
00:07:51,488 --> 00:07:52,990
The Ugly Guy crime.

150
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:54,258
Seriously?

151
00:07:54,391 --> 00:07:55,526
Arrest him.

152
00:08:00,497 --> 00:08:01,465
Hang on.

153
00:08:01,598 --> 00:08:03,066
What are you doing?

154
00:08:04,301 --> 00:08:07,237
-You have to greet somewhat upon meeting. -For exceptional bad acting...

155
00:08:07,371 --> 00:08:09,706
You always ruin the Running Men's plans.

156
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,109
We're arresting you for bad acting.

157
00:08:15,312 --> 00:08:16,780
-Arrest her. -What are you doing?

158
00:08:19,983 --> 00:08:23,120
Miss Song Ji Hyo appears for filming without makeup.

159
00:08:23,253 --> 00:08:25,022
You've committed the Bare Face crime.

160
00:08:27,024 --> 00:08:30,027
-Oppa, are we caught because of some crimes? -Thatis right.

161
00:08:30,127 --> 00:08:31,195
That's right.

162
00:08:32,863 --> 00:08:34,064
-Arrest him. -Hyung, hello.

163
00:08:34,164 --> 00:08:35,299
Huh?

164
00:08:38,769 --> 00:08:39,803
What crime did he do?

165
00:08:39,937 --> 00:08:41,305
He has too many crimes.

166
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:46,243
Betraying Running Man members, twelve counts.

167
00:08:46,343 --> 00:08:47,711
The crime of being scared, seven counts.

168
00:08:47,811 --> 00:08:49,780
A streak of three counts of the crime of misfortune.

169
00:08:49,913 --> 00:08:53,450
Plus the other miscellaneous items totalling twenty offences.

170
00:08:53,584 --> 00:08:55,152
You're under special arrest.

171
00:09:19,743 --> 00:09:22,312
-What? -Are we going to be locked in there?

172
00:09:22,813 --> 00:09:23,981
Oh, what's that?

173
00:09:24,515 --> 00:09:25,582
Why?

174
00:09:36,193 --> 00:09:38,729
Ok, criminals. Listen carefully.

175
00:09:38,929 --> 00:09:41,164
Criminal Lee Gwang Soo will alright first.

176
00:09:41,765 --> 00:09:42,966
What, alone?

177
00:09:43,066 --> 00:09:44,668
Please come out.

178
00:09:54,144 --> 00:09:55,612
Gwang Soo is dragged away.

179
00:09:58,916 --> 00:10:00,551
What’s all this, where is this place?

180
00:10:01,685 --> 00:10:03,387
What's with these house shoes?

181
00:10:06,123 --> 00:10:07,457
What's this?

182
00:10:08,058 --> 00:10:11,528
What's this? Where are you bringing me?

183
00:10:12,596 --> 00:10:14,398
Oh, it's so scary!

184
00:10:15,198 --> 00:10:17,334
You have someone that you'll miss, right?

185
00:10:17,334 --> 00:10:18,936
Jeez, really...

186
00:10:18,936 --> 00:10:20,504
Like we won't see them forever.

187
00:10:20,604 --> 00:10:21,605
Mr Ji Suk Jin.

188
00:10:21,605 --> 00:10:22,506
Yes.

189
00:10:25,842 --> 00:10:28,211
These are the house shoes I wore in middle school?

190
00:10:32,849 --> 00:10:35,018
I really loved them.

191
00:10:36,453 --> 00:10:38,422
We dated for real.

192
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:43,560
I'm being charged with green crime and you're giving me green clothes.

193
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:01,211
Here?

194
00:11:14,725 --> 00:11:16,093
What is this?

195
00:11:16,093 --> 00:11:17,794
Is this a real jail?

196
00:11:20,063 --> 00:11:23,233
Sheriff!

197
00:11:29,139 --> 00:11:30,707
Oh, it's really locked?

198
00:11:30,941 --> 00:11:32,442
They really locked it.

199
00:11:33,043 --> 00:11:35,545
We dated before!

200
00:11:39,116 --> 00:11:40,217
Open the door!

201
00:11:40,517 --> 00:11:41,785
Open the door!

202
00:11:41,985 --> 00:11:43,320
I said open the door!

203
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,155
Why am I in here?

204
00:12:36,006 --> 00:12:38,141
The colours of our clothes are different.

205
00:12:38,141 --> 00:12:39,543
It's weird.

206
00:12:47,718 --> 00:12:50,287
What are you doing?

207
00:12:53,323 --> 00:12:55,559
Jeezr I'm really going crazy.

208
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:00,464
I want to go to the toilet!

209
00:13:01,098 --> 00:13:02,766
I want to go to the toilet!

210
00:13:06,036 --> 00:13:07,437
Running Men.

211
00:13:07,971 --> 00:13:09,106
Running Men.

212
00:13:09,706 --> 00:13:11,041
Running Men.

213
00:13:12,609 --> 00:13:16,446
Everyone has been sentenced to six hours of imprisonment.

214
00:13:19,716 --> 00:13:24,121
Everyone has been sentenced to six hours of imprisonment.

215
00:13:25,522 --> 00:13:27,524
What? Aren't we tearing of nametags?

216
00:13:27,524 --> 00:13:30,060
You just want us to keep sitting here, for six hours?

217
00:13:30,293 --> 00:13:33,029
Especially for Mr Lee Gwang Soo who has committed many crimes...

218
00:13:33,029 --> 00:13:34,931
he will serve sixty hours.

219
00:13:39,102 --> 00:13:40,270
Oh?

220
00:13:41,104 --> 00:13:44,641
Before you serve your sentence, no one can even get out of here.

221
00:13:45,442 --> 00:13:47,010
Gwang Soo has sixty hours?

222
00:13:47,444 --> 00:13:49,212
How many days is sixy hours?

223
00:13:49,212 --> 00:13:52,983
- Why do I get sixty hours? - Everyone has a sentence of six hours.

224
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:55,452
Mr Lee Gwang Soo gets sixty hours.

225
00:13:55,819 --> 00:13:57,521
No!

226
00:13:59,689 --> 00:14:04,494
Before you serve your sentence, no one can even get out of here.

227
00:14:10,867 --> 00:14:13,069
If they're releasing us after six hours...

228
00:14:13,069 --> 00:14:16,139
So I'll just stay here for six hours then leave.

229
00:14:16,706 --> 00:14:19,042
Six hours isn't a very long time anyway.

230
00:14:19,042 --> 00:14:21,444
So I'll just play around for six hours.

231
00:14:22,712 --> 00:14:25,715
It's so simple. Oh, Running Man's extremely comfortable?

232
00:14:33,824 --> 00:14:36,092
Ok, throwing us, into jail here...

233
00:14:36,092 --> 00:14:39,696
they would expect us to try getting out, right?

234
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:44,568
Then there should be clues or something somewhere in this room?

235
00:14:48,505 --> 00:14:51,041
Something for us to make use of to get out of here.

236
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:53,643
The room is locked...

237
00:14:53,844 --> 00:14:56,213
so could it be numbers, numbers for the lock?

238
00:15:01,952 --> 00:15:03,153
I can't hold it anymore.

239
00:15:51,368 --> 00:15:53,236
-Give it to me. - Please be quiet.

240
00:15:53,236 --> 00:15:54,437
I'll be quiet.

241
00:15:54,938 --> 00:15:56,373
Give this to me.

242
00:16:01,144 --> 00:16:02,913
Is this... Oldboy?

243
00:16:04,014 --> 00:16:05,382
Who are you?

244
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:09,920
Give me some soy sauce and pickled radish.

245
00:16:10,453 --> 00:16:11,788
Sir!

246
00:16:12,055 --> 00:16:13,723
Give me some pickled radish!

247
00:16:14,624 --> 00:16:16,826
Hey, isn't this Oldboy?

248
00:16:17,494 --> 00:16:20,130
What's this?

249
00:16:23,767 --> 00:16:27,437
Am I Chol Min Shik sunbae in Oldboy? Giving me fried dumplings...

250
00:16:27,804 --> 00:16:29,072
Annoying.

251
00:16:29,406 --> 00:16:31,708
Am I Choi Min Shik sunbae giving me fried dumplings?

252
00:16:31,708 --> 00:16:33,710
Is it Oldboy now?

253
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:36,913
I'm hungry, I'll eat first.

254
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:42,385
Why couldn't you order seafood noodles for me?

255
00:16:42,752 --> 00:16:44,020
Slieriff!

256
00:16:44,621 --> 00:16:45,889
Pickled radish!

257
00:16:46,356 --> 00:16:48,058
Pickled radish!

258
00:16:50,193 --> 00:16:51,895
Give me some soy sauce, soy sauce.

259
00:16:58,168 --> 00:16:59,936
I'm really going crazy.

260
00:17:05,942 --> 00:17:07,610
I'll definitely find you.

261
00:17:08,144 --> 00:17:10,313
Whoever locked me up here.

262
00:17:12,582 --> 00:17:15,385
They might as well give me food for my wellbeing.

263
00:17:16,886 --> 00:17:18,254
I'm trying to lose weight.

264
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:23,593
They don't even give pickled radish.

265
00:17:35,205 --> 00:17:37,207
These fried dumplings, where...

266
00:17:47,317 --> 00:17:50,420
Please escape from this room and flee this building within four hours.

267
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:51,988
Good luck.

268
00:17:56,926 --> 00:17:58,094
Daebak.

269
00:17:58,328 --> 00:18:00,196
But how do I get out of the room?

270
00:18:20,316 --> 00:18:21,551
The pass code.

271
00:18:22,118 --> 00:18:23,953
There must be a pass code.

272
00:18:36,433 --> 00:18:37,500
Oh.

273
00:18:39,836 --> 00:18:43,606
Escape from this room and flee this building within four hours. Good luck.

274
00:18:46,743 --> 00:18:48,711
But, you have to tell me how to get out.

275
00:18:49,412 --> 00:18:51,781
How do I get...

276
00:18:54,984 --> 00:18:56,719
Are there clues in the room?

277
00:19:05,762 --> 00:19:07,864
There should be a way out of this place somewhere.

278
00:19:08,131 --> 00:19:09,632
Can't they tell me?

279
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:17,841
Right, no matter how creative they are, hiding it in dumpling is a bit... right?

280
00:19:17,841 --> 00:19:22,345
These still have to be cooked, I don't think it's easy to put something inside.

281
00:19:24,848 --> 00:19:26,382
Why these dumplings?

282
00:19:37,093 --> 00:19:39,929
I just ate with my hands.

283
00:19:40,597 --> 00:19:41,698
What?

284
00:19:45,168 --> 00:19:47,937
Escape from this room within four hours and flee this building.

285
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:03,553
I'm eating now, you're making me uncomfortable.

286
00:20:15,498 --> 00:20:17,167
The kids have all started.

287
00:20:17,867 --> 00:20:19,769
They are starting to move, Suk Jin hyung too.

288
00:20:19,836 --> 00:20:22,672
Ji Hyo and HaHa has started too.

289
00:20:38,555 --> 00:20:40,023
Basketball, five players.

290
00:20:40,957 --> 00:20:42,058
3 in 'Three Kingdoms'.

291
00:20:46,196 --> 00:20:47,864
Six people, five people.

292
00:20:48,965 --> 00:20:50,200
Two water bottles.

293
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:55,238
There are three 5s.

294
00:21:58,568 --> 00:22:00,637
Ah, it‘s not it.

295
00:22:15,785 --> 00:22:17,687
How frustrating.

296
00:23:13,142 --> 00:23:15,511
Ok, there's no one now. Let's go.

297
00:23:15,912 --> 00:23:18,681
I have to go, I have to go. It's now, it's now.

298
00:23:26,723 --> 00:23:30,660
Find the building's blueprint hidden inside this building.

299
00:24:12,402 --> 00:24:15,171
7th floor, 7tb floor. HaHa's room. He has escaped.

300
00:24:19,008 --> 00:24:23,413
Prisoner number 2 escaped.

301
00:24:30,086 --> 00:24:31,254
What?

302
00:24:31,254 --> 00:24:35,358
-Prisoner number 2 escaped. Prisoner number 2 escaped. -What?

303
00:24:35,625 --> 00:24:36,993
Already?

304
00:24:37,827 --> 00:24:39,128
He escaped?

305
00:24:43,332 --> 00:24:45,401
HaHa escaped, HaHa.

306
00:24:52,308 --> 00:24:53,643
Stop!

307
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:08,591
Prisoner number 2 escaped.

308
00:25:10,993 --> 00:25:16,766
If it's just six hours there's no point escaping.

309
00:25:18,968 --> 00:25:23,773
Recording, performance, filming.

310
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:26,642
It has been too busy.

311
00:25:28,377 --> 00:25:31,581
Right now, I want some time alone.

312
00:25:33,282 --> 00:25:35,151
While eating dumplings.

313
00:25:35,418 --> 00:25:37,420
I'm not going out today.

314
00:25:43,659 --> 00:25:45,895
There's something written here!

315
00:25:47,497 --> 00:25:49,799
I'm such a fool.

316
00:25:50,333 --> 00:25:52,935
The chopsticks were like this so I didn't know.

317
00:25:55,571 --> 00:25:56,672
But how do I get out?

318
00:26:01,043 --> 00:26:02,512
I'm not leaving!

319
00:26:02,879 --> 00:26:04,514
I'm not leaving!

320
00:26:06,616 --> 00:26:08,918
Why is there no crossword puzzle?

321
00:26:35,545 --> 00:26:37,046
Me...

322
00:26:39,615 --> 00:26:40,983
Merong.

323
00:26:43,819 --> 00:26:45,688
Seriously, merong.

324
00:26:46,088 --> 00:26:49,525
This is seriously pissing me off.

325
00:26:54,997 --> 00:26:57,867
That's right. An 'R'.

326
00:26:59,068 --> 00:27:00,336
Daebak.

327
00:27:07,443 --> 00:27:08,778
8084!

328
00:27:32,234 --> 00:27:35,438
Please find the hidden building's blueprints.

329
00:27:56,359 --> 00:27:58,761
-Prisoner number 6 escaped! -Again!?

330
00:27:58,894 --> 00:28:01,130
Prisoner number 6 escaped.

331
00:28:01,831 --> 00:28:04,767
Prisoner number 6 escaped.

332
00:28:12,775 --> 00:28:14,744
Ah, I was shocked!

333
00:28:15,778 --> 00:28:17,513
-Did you get the mission card? -I got it.

334
00:28:17,546 --> 00:28:19,348
- The blueprint? - Yes, the blueprint.

335
00:28:19,348 --> 00:28:21,083
- Where is the blueprint? - I'm looking for it too.

336
00:28:21,217 --> 00:28:22,752
The first and second floor?

337
00:28:22,918 --> 00:28:24,887
We have to tell the members quickly.

338
00:28:25,054 --> 00:28:29,692
Don't you know? Don't forget that it might be an individual battle.

339
00:28:30,993 --> 00:28:33,729
Ji Hyo, seeing you here is making me really fond of you.

340
00:28:34,030 --> 00:28:35,898
Oppa will treat you better.

341
00:28:36,065 --> 00:28:37,066
Oppa, I'll be nice to you too.

342
00:28:37,833 --> 00:28:38,968
Ji Hyo...

343
00:28:51,747 --> 00:28:54,684
There must be a reason for these things.

344
00:28:54,784 --> 00:28:56,585
They can't be placed here for nothing.

345
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:16,172
These things... really...

346
00:29:25,815 --> 00:29:27,450
It's open. 3461.

347
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,888
Please find the hidden blueprint.

348
00:29:48,938 --> 00:29:50,573
I didn't expect it to be here...

349
00:30:01,817 --> 00:30:02,952
Oh, hang on.

350
00:30:28,043 --> 00:30:30,513
Oh, scared me!

351
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,815
Oh, my heart is going to Jump out!

352
00:31:06,715 --> 00:31:10,085
Oh! Why are these blacked out?

353
00:31:11,954 --> 00:31:14,023
Which years do they want?

354
00:31:15,491 --> 00:31:17,226
I need to go to the toilet.

355
00:31:18,127 --> 00:31:23,332
Year 80... 7... year 70. 807.

356
00:31:23,833 --> 00:31:25,201
807.

357
00:31:49,491 --> 00:31:50,326
Hey!

358
00:32:00,236 --> 00:32:02,538
Where did they go after escaping?

359
00:32:09,678 --> 00:32:10,713
Oh.

360
00:32:11,013 --> 00:32:13,282
There seems to be numbers written here.

361
00:32:19,822 --> 00:32:21,624
It couldn't be.

362
00:32:22,825 --> 00:32:26,962
Jeez, it's seriously unbelievable. It was written on the window!

363
00:32:27,296 --> 00:32:29,465
Ah, it hurts my pride.

364
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:48,183
Prisoner number 4 escaped. Prisoner number 4 escaped.

365
00:32:53,656 --> 00:32:56,392
-I'm going. -Go.

366
00:32:56,492 --> 00:32:58,627
-Hyung, don't get eliminated! -Ok.

367
00:33:00,963 --> 00:33:03,132
Gwang Soo, seventh floor! Gwang Soo, seventh floor!

368
00:33:03,299 --> 00:33:05,567
Gwang Soo, 7th floor! Gwang Soo, 7th floor!

369
00:33:06,201 --> 00:33:07,937
Lee Gwang Soo, seventh floor!

370
00:33:08,637 --> 00:33:10,873
HaHa hyung's heading toward the roof! HaHa hyung, rooftop!

371
00:33:31,794 --> 00:33:33,495
Is it the blueprint?

372
00:33:35,297 --> 00:33:39,601
This isn't it. This is the construction plan for this room.

373
00:33:39,935 --> 00:33:42,471
It's not the Running Man blueprint.

374
00:33:42,738 --> 00:33:45,074
There should be a sign.

375
00:33:51,547 --> 00:33:53,882
In the movies, it is usually in this kind of place.

376
00:34:04,059 --> 00:34:04,960
Quickly.

377
00:34:14,370 --> 00:34:16,939
Oh, hang on. Ah, what is it?

378
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:27,149
Oh hold on, what happened?

379
00:34:28,117 --> 00:34:29,551
Why?

380
00:34:32,154 --> 00:34:33,122
Why?

381
00:34:33,255 --> 00:34:36,458
I Just came out, why do I have to go back in again?

382
00:34:36,658 --> 00:34:39,928
I don't understand why I have to go back in again.

383
00:34:42,431 --> 00:34:45,801
Please remember that’s my soul can't be tied up.

384
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:26,942
No, wait.

385
00:35:27,643 --> 00:35:30,345
Can't I just go out for a while?

386
00:35:32,181 --> 00:35:35,150
Why are you always following me? Are you in charge of me?

387
00:35:38,454 --> 00:35:44,326
Even if my body is tied up, you can never tie up my freedom.

388
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:48,330
That's for you to know.

389
00:36:06,348 --> 00:36:07,749
Come in, come in!

390
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:53,829
Is it Joo hyung?

391
00:36:59,201 --> 00:37:00,269
Hey!

392
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:03,272
Myeok PD!

393
00:37:10,646 --> 00:37:11,914
- No, why? - Did you escape?

394
00:37:11,947 --> 00:37:14,750
Why are you catching us?

395
00:37:15,350 --> 00:37:18,554
- Myeok PD, why did you catch us? - Please go over there quickly.

396
00:37:18,654 --> 00:37:20,722
- Go where? Where? - Hurry, hurry.

397
00:37:20,856 --> 00:37:23,592
-Quickly go where? - Go quickly and you'll know.

398
00:37:23,659 --> 00:37:25,494
- What did you say? - Go forward.

399
00:37:26,528 --> 00:37:28,330
Where Is he asking me to run to?

400
00:37:33,735 --> 00:37:35,337
There's nothing ere.

401
00:37:36,672 --> 00:37:37,472
Oh?

402
00:37:40,642 --> 00:37:41,610
Oh?

403
00:37:43,445 --> 00:37:45,113
What is this?

404
00:37:48,116 --> 00:37:50,252
I thought this was a closet. What is this?

405
00:37:51,053 --> 00:37:52,588
It's not supposed to be like this.

406
00:37:52,721 --> 00:37:53,655
This one is blocked off.

407
00:37:54,856 --> 00:37:56,525
Is this an exit?

408
00:38:17,813 --> 00:38:19,448
What‘s this?

409
00:38:21,683 --> 00:38:23,852
What are you doing here?

410
00:38:24,519 --> 00:38:27,956
-Hello. -I don't want to be a spy.

411
00:38:27,990 --> 00:38:31,126
Do you know what day it is today?

412
00:38:31,326 --> 00:38:33,729
- Today is 10th of April, right? - Yes.

413
00:38:34,830 --> 00:38:38,867
Voomes Bond, do you remember the water gun episode?

414
00:38:40,269 --> 00:38:42,537
Yes.

415
00:38:45,841 --> 00:38:50,078
Secretly eliminate your team mates by spraying the water gun.

416
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:51,847
This!

417
00:38:52,314 --> 00:38:53,015
Is it raining?

418
00:39:08,497 --> 00:39:10,732
It has been exactly one year since that broadcast.

419
00:39:10,832 --> 00:39:11,566
So?

420
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:17,773
So to commemorate the 1st anniversary, Yoo Jae Suk is selected to receive a special pardon.

421
00:39:18,273 --> 00:39:19,241
So?

422
00:39:19,341 --> 00:39:21,476
-Do you know the Jail Breakers (movie)? -Yes.

423
00:39:21,843 --> 00:39:23,045
You'll become a special envoy.

424
00:39:23,278 --> 00:39:27,182
You don't have to serve the six hours prison sentence.

425
00:39:27,316 --> 00:39:34,122
But, if there's a problem here or the prisoners cause any problem or escape the building..

426
00:39:34,790 --> 00:39:37,192
Therefore, you have to make sure no one gets out.

427
00:39:37,225 --> 00:39:40,495
If that happens you have to fulfill your sentence.

428
00:39:40,529 --> 00:39:41,263
What should I do?

429
00:39:41,296 --> 00:39:44,933
So, you have to return all the members to the cells.

430
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:48,170
That's the only way you can get out.

431
00:39:48,937 --> 00:39:50,972
You'll get amnesty to get out.

432
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:57,412
No, now that you've let everyone out, you're telling me to put them back in again?

433
00:39:57,846 --> 00:40:00,015
How do I catch them?

434
00:40:00,115 --> 00:40:02,351
Jong Kook, how can I put him back into his cell?

435
00:40:02,417 --> 00:40:05,654
So that why I told you earlier, it's the 1st anniversary of the water gun episode.

436
00:40:05,954 --> 00:40:07,356
Yes.

437
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:20,469
This is a different story then.

438
00:40:20,469 --> 00:40:23,972
I thought. I have to catch and put them back in their rooms.

439
00:40:23,972 --> 00:40:25,674
- Is this it? - Yes.

440
00:40:30,345 --> 00:40:32,514
Wait, please don't get too excited.

441
00:40:32,514 --> 00:40:34,783
-I get excited when I see water guns. -Sit down first.

442
00:40:34,783 --> 00:40:38,320
I missed the grip of the water gun. The water gun is already pulling me.

443
00:40:40,522 --> 00:40:43,525
This is really making my palms sweat.

444
00:40:43,525 --> 00:40:44,693
What's that for?

445
00:40:44,693 --> 00:40:46,528
Since it's not litmus paper...

446
00:40:46,528 --> 00:40:49,498
Put the colouring into the water gun to take them out.

447
00:40:49,498 --> 00:40:50,565
You get one water gun.

448
00:40:50,565 --> 00:40:52,234
You can pick from the different water guns.

449
00:40:52,234 --> 00:40:54,169
Choose just one colour.

450
00:40:54,436 --> 00:40:57,572
- If the colour... - If they are stained, they're out?

451
00:40:57,572 --> 00:40:59,941
So, they're going to the jail spontaneously?

452
00:40:59,941 --> 00:41:03,011
Once they're shot, the security team will force them back.

453
00:41:05,614 --> 00:41:07,182
It's finally here.

454
00:41:07,816 --> 00:41:09,618
After one year it's finally here.

455
00:41:27,269 --> 00:41:29,871
Seriously, what's with this?

456
00:41:34,543 --> 00:41:36,344
I choose this.

457
00:41:36,812 --> 00:41:38,447
Green.

458
00:41:38,513 --> 00:41:39,981
Of course it's that.

459
00:41:39,981 --> 00:41:41,917
It's not 'of course'!

460
00:42:17,085 --> 00:42:19,788
What's this I'm doing?

461
00:42:21,356 --> 00:42:24,459
What am l doing with this green colouring?

462
00:42:24,826 --> 00:42:26,127
I'm seriously.

463
00:42:26,127 --> 00:42:28,763
I Didn't know they will give me this.

464
00:42:29,498 --> 00:42:31,833
Why didn't they give it to me when l wanted it?

465
00:42:36,338 --> 00:42:39,241
Looks like a carp bread filled with washable.

466
00:42:46,748 --> 00:42:48,383
I'm already nervous.

467
00:42:49,017 --> 00:42:50,719
I'm already nervous.

468
00:43:00,495 --> 00:43:01,997
I'm going crazy.

469
00:43:02,497 --> 00:43:03,865
You be careful.

470
00:43:03,932 --> 00:43:05,100
You be careful.

471
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:06,401
You're frightened too right?

472
00:43:06,401 --> 00:43:08,403
I'm seriously going crazy.

473
00:43:36,665 --> 00:43:38,400
Suk Jin hyung.

474
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:41,102
Why does Suk Jin hyung appear every time I'm at these moments?

475
00:43:44,973 --> 00:43:46,374
I'm nervous.

476
00:43:48,543 --> 00:43:50,512
Oh, it's nerve-wracking.

477
00:44:00,855 --> 00:44:02,490
Oh, oh!

478
00:44:02,490 --> 00:44:05,560
Ah!

479
00:44:13,201 --> 00:44:15,003
Heyt you're really...

480
00:44:22,143 --> 00:44:23,511
Oh, you shocked me.

481
00:44:23,545 --> 00:44:24,879
Come quickly!

482
00:44:24,913 --> 00:44:27,015
Hey, where did you guys go?

483
00:44:27,015 --> 00:44:28,984
- We found the map, hyung. - Where?

484
00:44:31,252 --> 00:44:37,225
If someone escape the building, you have to serve your sentence.

485
00:44:37,359 --> 00:44:39,594
Hyung, there's no one here, hyung.

486
00:44:39,594 --> 00:44:41,029
Hurry.

487
00:44:41,363 --> 00:44:44,332
The blueprints, the blueprints.

488
00:44:44,833 --> 00:44:46,368
Nothing here.

489
00:44:46,368 --> 00:44:48,203
It will clearly be in this sort of place.

490
00:44:51,473 --> 00:44:53,141
Gwang Soo, what's this?

491
00:44:53,141 --> 00:44:55,377
This and the watch must mean something.

492
00:44:56,311 --> 00:44:57,379
Oh.

493
00:45:05,020 --> 00:45:06,454
Hyung's jjang right?

494
00:45:06,454 --> 00:45:07,789
Hyung!

495
00:45:07,789 --> 00:45:09,891
Kim Jong Kook, Kim Jong Kook!

496
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:14,629
The computer room, the computer room!

497
00:45:16,464 --> 00:45:19,501
The third floor, the third floor.

498
00:45:20,802 --> 00:45:22,170
What's that?

499
00:45:22,170 --> 00:45:23,471
I don't know.

500
00:45:23,471 --> 00:45:25,273
Because there's a watch I'll just wear it.

501
00:45:25,273 --> 00:45:26,841
-I want something too... -Open it up.

502
00:45:26,841 --> 00:45:28,543
Open it, quickly.

503
00:45:33,248 --> 00:45:34,382
It's gold.

504
00:45:35,150 --> 00:45:36,451
It's gold.

505
00:45:38,119 --> 00:45:40,388
Hyung. Just in case something happen, I'll hold on to this.

506
00:45:40,388 --> 00:45:42,090
Hyung, please trust me.

507
00:45:42,090 --> 00:45:44,059
I can't trust you.

508
00:45:53,968 --> 00:45:55,470
Where did you find it?

509
00:46:00,842 --> 00:46:02,544
Hey Giraffe!

510
00:46:09,417 --> 00:46:10,952
-Whatls there? -A key!

511
00:46:10,952 --> 00:46:12,554
What key?

512
00:46:14,022 --> 00:46:16,191
Hey, how did you find it?

513
00:46:31,940 --> 00:46:34,542
Hey, where are you headed?

514
00:46:36,211 --> 00:46:37,812
Where, where?

515
00:47:00,301 --> 00:47:01,536
Hyung, come in!

516
00:47:01,536 --> 00:47:02,270
Why?

517
00:47:02,370 --> 00:47:04,172
Come in! Come in quickly!

518
00:47:07,642 --> 00:47:11,880
Target, Lee Gwang Soo. Target, Lee Gwang Soo.

519
00:47:15,950 --> 00:47:17,852
There must be a key here.

520
00:47:19,087 --> 00:47:20,121
What did you say?

521
00:47:20,121 --> 00:47:21,389
There's a key here in this room.

522
00:47:21,389 --> 00:47:22,724
-In this room? -Yeah.

523
00:47:22,724 --> 00:47:24,325
Find the key, quickly!

524
00:47:27,562 --> 00:47:29,664
The key, it's a key.

525
00:47:33,368 --> 00:47:34,936
There's a key here?

526
00:47:34,936 --> 00:47:37,672
Hyung, according to the map we found, there's a key here.

527
00:47:38,573 --> 00:47:40,842
Hyung, we don’t have to go to another room.

528
00:47:40,875 --> 00:47:42,811
-They're all locked -They're all locked.

529
00:47:42,811 --> 00:47:45,713
I locked the door. Hyung, I locked the door.

530
00:47:50,718 --> 00:47:52,554
The key's here?

531
00:48:02,030 --> 00:48:03,565
Hey, where Is it?

532
00:48:03,598 --> 00:48:05,033
Look for It quickly!

533
00:48:05,033 --> 00:48:07,669
The map said It would be here,.in the computer room.

534
00:48:15,577 --> 00:48:17,712
No, why is the door open, who opened It?

535
00:48:17,745 --> 00:48:19,581
- Who opened the door? - What, what?

536
00:48:20,081 --> 00:48:21,683
What, what?

537
00:48:26,087 --> 00:48:27,422
Hang on.

538
00:48:27,455 --> 00:48:28,656
What?

539
00:48:28,690 --> 00:48:30,191
Oh what, what?

540
00:48:33,294 --> 00:48:35,163
Isn't Jong Kook hyung over there?

541
00:48:37,832 --> 00:48:39,234
Oh.

542
00:48:42,036 --> 00:48:44,038
Isn't Jong Kook hyung over here too?

543
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:47,041
Jong Kook hyung's also here!

544
00:48:47,041 --> 00:48:48,943
Why are you just doing this to me?

545
00:48:50,111 --> 00:48:51,546
Hang on!

546
00:48:52,046 --> 00:48:55,083
Hyung! Hyung!

547
00:48:59,888 --> 00:49:03,024
This is bad, Kim Jong Kook might have noticed something.

548
00:49:04,425 --> 00:49:06,194
I forgot.

549
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:14,869
Lee Gwang Soo, jailed again.

550
00:49:15,236 --> 00:49:17,438
Lee Gwang Soo, jailed again.

551
00:49:21,342 --> 00:49:22,744
It‘s all over.

552
00:49:25,079 --> 00:49:26,381
Gary hyung!

553
00:49:28,349 --> 00:49:30,151
Gary hyung!

554
00:49:34,422 --> 00:49:36,224
Just tie it lightly.

555
00:49:37,091 --> 00:49:38,526
That's it.

556
00:49:38,860 --> 00:49:42,163
Ah really, they seriously don't give us a chance.

557
00:49:42,196 --> 00:49:43,698
Work hard.

558
00:49:43,731 --> 00:49:45,166
- Do a good job. -Yes.

559
00:49:49,170 --> 00:49:51,940
Hyung, turn around. I'll untie you.

560
00:49:53,474 --> 00:49:55,043
Hey, hang on.

561
00:49:56,177 --> 00:49:57,745
I'll help untie you.

562
00:49:58,179 --> 00:49:59,814
Oh, right.

563
00:50:00,014 --> 00:50:01,349
Hey, ok.

564
00:50:02,784 --> 00:50:03,751
Hurry, hyung.

565
00:50:04,319 --> 00:50:05,420
Please help me too.

566
00:50:07,588 --> 00:50:10,124
Ah, really... don't think about it.

567
00:50:10,291 --> 00:50:11,559
Ah, hyung.

568
00:50:12,393 --> 00:50:14,529
How do I untie this? Yours Is too tight.

569
00:50:18,700 --> 00:50:19,500
Let's go.

570
00:50:20,835 --> 00:50:22,770
I'm really... going crazy.

571
00:50:23,271 --> 00:50:25,173
- Hyung, fighting. - Fighting.

572
00:50:38,653 --> 00:50:40,421
I'm going crazy.

573
00:50:44,692 --> 00:50:46,728
I did this once before...

574
00:50:47,061 --> 00:50:50,098
The last time none of them had any suspicions, but...

575
00:50:50,365 --> 00:50:52,533
This time it's different.

576
00:50:57,739 --> 00:50:59,640
Oh, that scared me.

577
00:51:00,241 --> 00:51:01,943
-That scared me. -They are everywhere.

578
00:51:02,410 --> 00:51:03,478
Where?

579
00:51:04,045 --> 00:51:05,380
They are all over the place.

580
00:51:05,380 --> 00:51:08,016
Earlier... You survived?

581
00:51:09,350 --> 00:51:10,551
How did Gwang Soo do?

582
00:51:10,718 --> 00:51:11,853
Don't know.

583
00:51:11,853 --> 00:51:13,388
Did you find the key earlier?

584
00:51:13,821 --> 00:51:14,822
I didn't.

585
00:51:15,123 --> 00:51:15,923
Come on in.

586
00:51:20,461 --> 00:51:21,829
Hey, where are you?

587
00:51:21,963 --> 00:51:23,464
Come in, come in.

588
00:51:23,664 --> 00:51:24,766
I'm going crazy.

589
00:51:24,999 --> 00:51:29,237
In the 3rd or 5th floor, we have to go to 520...

590
00:51:29,370 --> 00:51:31,672
-Ah.. I'll show It to you. -What?

591
00:51:34,942 --> 00:51:37,011
Where did you find this map?

592
00:51:40,114 --> 00:51:42,450
325 is the computer lab we went to earlier.

593
00:51:42,483 --> 00:51:43,684
There's a key here.

594
00:51:43,718 --> 00:51:45,620
And the guards room...

595
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:47,021
They're here then.

596
00:51:47,021 --> 00:51:47,922
520.

597
00:51:48,022 --> 00:51:48,890
On the sixth floor...

598
00:51:48,956 --> 00:51:51,192
Hyung Room 520 on the 5th floor.

599
00:51:51,325 --> 00:51:52,760
On the sixth floor...

600
00:51:53,694 --> 00:51:55,563
Room 620, room 620....

601
00:51:55,663 --> 00:51:57,498
Which floor is 620 on?

602
00:51:59,267 --> 00:52:01,135
It’s Just downstairs.

603
00:52:01,135 --> 00:52:02,870
Hyung, we've been to the 6th floor.

604
00:52:29,163 --> 00:52:31,132
Because girls carry a lot.

605
00:52:31,799 --> 00:52:35,136
Kim Jong Kook should have been dealt with at the start.

606
00:52:39,540 --> 00:52:40,842
I'm going this way.

607
00:52:55,456 --> 00:52:56,324
What are you doing!

608
00:52:56,457 --> 00:52:57,525
Runny nose.

609
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:00,228
Hold it in.

610
00:53:04,031 --> 00:53:06,601
They are right there.

611
00:53:09,570 --> 00:53:10,972
I'm going crazy.

612
00:53:16,377 --> 00:53:18,813
Hyung, don't open it.

613
00:53:19,113 --> 00:53:20,481
They will see you.

614
00:53:20,681 --> 00:53:22,416
They will see you if you open it.

615
00:53:22,650 --> 00:53:24,585
Stay still, stay still.

616
00:53:24,986 --> 00:53:26,721
Stay still, Hyung!

617
00:53:28,289 --> 00:53:28,890
Move aside.

618
00:53:29,991 --> 00:53:31,325
Hold this.

619
00:53:31,325 --> 00:53:33,161
Wow, you're so amazing.

620
00:54:04,759 --> 00:54:06,060
There’s no one.

621
00:54:06,060 --> 00:54:07,929
Target, Kim Jong Kook.

622
00:54:18,973 --> 00:54:20,141
I'll go first.

623
00:54:29,116 --> 00:54:30,251
Hang on...

624
00:54:36,524 --> 00:54:37,892
Who told you?

625
00:54:58,346 --> 00:55:02,883
Kim Jong Kook, imprisoned again.

626
00:55:03,284 --> 00:55:06,988
Sending Jong Kook back in is as good as controlling the ace.

627
00:55:07,121 --> 00:55:08,923
Did you see me take it out and put it back in again?

628
00:55:15,863 --> 00:55:16,931
What's this?

629
00:55:18,399 --> 00:55:19,533
A watch...

630
00:55:24,238 --> 00:55:25,573
Thank you.

631
00:55:31,245 --> 00:55:32,280
Is it gold?

632
00:55:34,615 --> 00:55:38,619
How do I do this? I'm going crazy.

633
00:55:40,154 --> 00:55:41,422
It's a gold bar!

634
00:55:48,562 --> 00:55:52,767
This is no joke....Today is seriously no joke.

635
00:55:54,635 --> 00:55:55,970
- Hyung. - Jae Suk.

636
00:55:56,070 --> 00:55:57,672
You found it, right? You didn't?

637
00:55:58,072 --> 00:56:00,341
I haven't found it.

638
00:56:00,341 --> 00:56:02,443
Let's go together.

639
00:56:03,210 --> 00:56:04,645
-I found it. -What did you found?

640
00:56:04,712 --> 00:56:06,614
-I found it. -Where did you find it?

641
00:56:06,881 --> 00:56:08,683
Hey, you still haven't found it?

642
00:56:08,783 --> 00:56:10,318
I saw what Jong Kook found.

643
00:56:10,351 --> 00:56:12,653
-You saw it? -I saw the one Jong Kook found.

644
00:56:12,787 --> 00:56:14,522
-Where did you find it? -Hey...

645
00:56:14,588 --> 00:56:17,091
I already found it, but... right now...

646
00:56:17,925 --> 00:56:19,694
I feel really bad for you...

647
00:56:19,860 --> 00:56:20,695
What did you find?

648
00:56:20,728 --> 00:56:22,396
Right now, you can just walk comfortably here.

649
00:56:22,396 --> 00:56:23,864
Walk comfortably here.

650
00:56:27,335 --> 00:56:28,803
-This is it. -What is this?

651
00:56:28,969 --> 00:56:30,171
Oh, the patrol...

652
00:56:30,971 --> 00:56:34,775
From 1:00 to 1:30 they are all at the 1st floor now.

653
00:56:34,775 --> 00:56:36,711
We just need to avoid the 1st floor.

654
00:56:36,744 --> 00:56:39,947
So that's why you must have the watch.

655
00:56:40,081 --> 00:56:42,950
Why are you so slow today?

656
00:56:43,818 --> 00:56:45,286
Jae Suk, you really...

657
00:56:45,419 --> 00:56:46,821
So, hyung Is the shining ace today?

658
00:56:46,854 --> 00:56:48,356
I am the ace.

659
00:56:48,723 --> 00:56:50,825
Today, I'm so sharp...

660
00:56:51,025 --> 00:56:52,493
Hey Yoo Suk, tell him.

661
00:56:52,693 --> 00:56:55,162
-I'm like lighting today -Is Suk Jin hyung really like lightning?

662
00:56:55,162 --> 00:56:56,530
When I saw him earlier, he was like this.

663
00:56:57,331 --> 00:57:02,036
Hey, I'm not kidding. I hid myself, disappeared and appeared again.

664
00:57:02,036 --> 00:57:03,771
-Hey, look at this. -Huh?

665
00:57:05,740 --> 00:57:06,874
What time is it now, hyung?

666
00:57:06,941 --> 00:57:08,442
It's 1:09 now.

667
00:57:08,442 --> 00:57:10,111
It's here. Look at this.

668
00:57:37,138 --> 00:57:38,572
Hyung, let's quickly split up.

669
00:57:39,340 --> 00:57:40,341
Come here.

670
00:57:41,575 --> 00:57:43,644
Meeting... Because it's time for a meeting.

671
00:57:43,644 --> 00:57:44,945
Because it's time for meeting.

672
00:57:45,312 --> 00:57:45,880
What?

673
00:57:46,514 --> 00:57:47,748
It's meeting time, but why?

674
00:57:48,082 --> 00:57:49,016
- But... - What's this?

675
00:57:49,083 --> 00:57:50,351
Isn't it time for meeting??!

676
00:57:50,751 --> 00:57:52,286
Isn't it time for meeting??!

677
00:57:54,121 --> 00:57:55,689
Isn't it time for meeting?

678
00:57:55,689 --> 00:57:58,192
Hang on... These people really...

679
00:57:58,826 --> 00:58:01,395
Hyung, didn't you say 1st floor?

680
00:58:01,562 --> 00:58:04,832
-No, according to the plan, they should be at the 1st floor. -What is this?

681
00:58:06,033 --> 00:58:08,335
Aren't you having a meeting on the first floor today?

682
00:58:11,572 --> 00:58:12,873
Ah really...

683
00:58:15,443 --> 00:58:16,944
Ah... what is this?

684
00:58:17,178 --> 00:58:18,579
Where are we going? Huh?

685
00:58:18,579 --> 00:58:20,114
It should be there.

686
00:58:20,147 --> 00:58:21,916
- Hyung, where are you going? - Where am I going?

687
00:58:22,450 --> 00:58:23,851
Suk Jin hyung!

688
00:58:27,755 --> 00:58:29,256
What's happening?

689
00:58:29,490 --> 00:58:30,925
Why am I going here?

690
00:58:35,529 --> 00:58:36,297
Excuse me...

691
00:58:38,899 --> 00:58:39,967
This... excuse me.

692
00:58:40,100 --> 00:58:41,535
I'll give you this.

693
00:58:42,770 --> 00:58:43,370
Gold!

694
00:58:44,538 --> 00:58:45,539
Gold!!

695
00:58:48,943 --> 00:58:50,411
Let me out!

696
00:58:51,946 --> 00:58:53,414
Jong Kook hyung!

697
00:58:57,585 --> 00:58:59,086
At least give me the gold!

698
00:59:12,099 --> 00:59:12,833
Huh?

699
00:59:16,570 --> 00:59:17,571
What's this?

700
00:59:27,414 --> 00:59:28,549
Green.

701
00:59:31,685 --> 00:59:33,621
If it's green then it‘s Jae Suk hyung.

702
00:59:37,791 --> 00:59:39,393
Is Jae Suk hyung the culprit?

703
00:59:44,098 --> 00:59:45,733
This is not the time for me to be like this.

704
00:59:53,674 --> 00:59:55,242
I discovered the secret.

705
00:59:57,211 --> 00:59:58,879
I should not be the one here.

706
01:00:01,148 --> 01:00:02,550
Open the door!

707
01:00:03,584 --> 01:00:04,985
Open the door!

708
01:00:07,121 --> 01:00:08,289
Open the door!

709
01:00:09,823 --> 01:00:12,226
Open the door!

710
01:00:16,530 --> 01:00:18,866
Hurry, try contacting someone.

711
01:00:18,866 --> 01:00:21,936
Let Gary or someone pass by here.

712
01:00:24,738 --> 01:00:26,240
Oh! Wait!

713
01:00:31,645 --> 01:00:34,214
Ji Hyo! Help untie me!

714
01:00:34,248 --> 01:00:37,918
- Oppa, what are you doing there?? - Ji Hyo! I got caught. I got caught.

715
01:00:38,552 --> 01:00:39,286
Why did you get caught?

716
01:00:39,420 --> 01:00:41,655
Help untie me, quickly! Where have you been?

717
01:00:42,022 --> 01:00:43,824
- Oppa... - Ji Hyo, thank you. HaHa is...

718
01:00:43,924 --> 01:00:44,425
Oppa...

719
01:00:44,525 --> 01:00:48,295
- HaHa Is really .. he's a complete traitor. - Oppa, HaHa oppa has a bunch of keys.

720
01:00:48,429 --> 01:00:49,630
- Really? -Yes.

721
01:00:57,771 --> 01:00:59,740
Oppa, where did you find the map?

722
01:00:59,740 --> 01:01:01,742
Where did you find yours?

723
01:01:06,580 --> 01:01:07,915
Hey, lets open it.

724
01:01:08,215 --> 01:01:10,651
Just open it up, what do you think?

725
01:01:11,118 --> 01:01:14,321
Let me see! Just let me see it!

726
01:01:21,495 --> 01:01:23,397
Oppa, why are you here?

727
01:01:23,397 --> 01:01:26,400
I got caught by the security guards and brought here.

728
01:01:27,434 --> 01:01:28,636
Ji Hyo.

729
01:01:28,636 --> 01:01:31,839
- It from the front, why did you go to the back? - That's right.

730
01:01:33,841 --> 01:01:36,710
Ji Hyo, first lets escape from here quickly.

731
01:01:43,017 --> 01:01:44,785
There is not enough time.

732
01:01:51,158 --> 01:01:53,227
Where is everybody?

733
01:02:24,692 --> 01:02:27,327
I am the hero of the day...

734
01:02:27,461 --> 01:02:28,996
For sure!

735
01:03:08,836 --> 01:03:15,042
Ye Jin... Let's live happily together with this gold bar.

736
01:03:22,850 --> 01:03:24,084
What?

737
01:03:25,686 --> 01:03:27,121
What?

738
01:03:40,067 --> 01:03:43,470
This is too heavy, I can't put it here.

739
01:03:43,470 --> 01:03:44,872
Kang Gary!

740
01:03:46,039 --> 01:03:47,040
Kang Gary!

741
01:03:47,040 --> 01:03:48,242
- Did you find anything? - Nothing.

742
01:03:48,242 --> 01:03:49,877
How can you be here?

743
01:03:49,877 --> 01:03:51,411
I've been running continuously.

744
01:03:51,411 --> 01:03:53,280
Oppa, what did you find?

745
01:03:53,280 --> 01:03:54,681
I didn't find anything.

746
01:03:56,283 --> 01:04:00,287
Look me in the eye and tell me.

747
01:04:00,287 --> 01:04:01,522

Hey! It's such a commotion.

750
01:04:09,129 --> 01:04:10,597
Where did you find it?

751
01:04:10,597 --> 01:04:12,032
There are more?

752
01:04:13,767 --> 01:04:15,736
Your acting is too obvious.

753
01:04:15,736 --> 01:04:18,772
- No. How do you... - So you hid the gold bar there?

754
01:04:18,772 --> 01:04:20,040
Yes.

755
01:04:25,579 --> 01:04:26,980
I'm afraid it would drop out.

756
01:04:27,080 --> 01:04:29,917
-You look like a patient. -I have gold fever.

757
01:04:34,121 --> 01:04:35,789
Please save me!

758
01:04:36,390 --> 01:04:38,425

All lights out.

774
01:05:30,344 --> 01:05:32,346
I must act fast during the lights out.

775
01:05:41,989 --> 01:05:43,390
Now's the chance!

776
01:05:45,659 --> 01:05:47,361
Where should we go, oppa?

777
01:05:47,394 --> 01:05:49,963
-I don't know. Which floor is this now? - It’s the fourth floor.

What's this?

816
01:10:04,851 --> 01:10:06,019
Is this it?

817
01:10:06,553 --> 01:10:08,989
Three, four, six, one.

818
01:10:26,740 --> 01:10:30,076
To save energy, all lights out!

01:11:06,780 --> 01:11:09,349
-There was another password. -I see.

821
01:11:10,951 --> 01:11:13,220
I shook off guards...

822
01:11:13,453 --> 01:11:17,090
when the lights were off and I turned on the radio.

823
01:11:21,061 --> 01:11:22,395
Hyung, what did you find?

824
01:11:26,700 --> 01:11:28,168
This security...

-It's weird, that the shutter door is closed. -The shutter? -Yeah.

905
01:18:51,544 --> 01:18:52,845
It's upstairs. Come here.

906
01:18:52,945 --> 01:18:53,680
What is?

907
01:19:10,163 --> 01:19:11,431
Look at this...

908
01:19:13,166 --> 01:19:15,702
It's blocked off here, isn't that a shutter?

909
01:19:16,569 --> 01:19:17,770
I'll go and look.

910
01:19:39,292 --> 01:19:42,095
-What should we do If we don't have the key? -Wait a moment.

911
01:19:42,729 --> 01:19:44,030
Let's calm down.

912
01:19:44,030 --> 01:19:45,665
Really, calm down.

913
01:19:45,665 --> 01:19:46,999
Calm down.

914
01:19:47,200 --> 01:19:49,469
13, 21... there are so many numbers.

915
01:19:51,137 --> 01:19:55,141
-What floor is this? -Hey, if we open this, we can get out?

916
01:19:55,141 --> 01:19:56,442
I don't know.

917
01:20:03,116 --> 01:20:06,052
Hey, my heart is trembling so much.

918
01:20:06,753 --> 01:20:08,421
Calm down, calm down.

919
01:20:09,722 --> 01:20:10,623
Oh!

920
01:20:11,124 --> 01:20:12,058
Oh!

921
01:20:27,173 --> 01:20:28,741
-It is opened. -Jong Kook.

922
01:20:42,688 --> 01:20:44,304
Hey, my heart is trembling so much.

923
01:20:45,232 --> 01:20:46,688
Calm down, calm down.

924
01:20:48,096 --> 01:20:48,660
Oh!

925
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:50,320
Oh!

926
01:21:05,648 --> 01:21:07,168
-It is opened. -Jong Kook.

927
01:21:20,860 --> 01:21:22,595
-What are you doing? -Hang on.

928
01:21:23,329 --> 01:21:25,565
What are you doing?

929
01:21:26,899 --> 01:21:28,067
What did you do?

930
01:21:32,338 --> 01:21:35,942
Target Kim Jong Kook. Target Kim Jong Kook.

931
01:21:38,344 --> 01:21:39,679
What did you do?

932
01:21:40,713 --> 01:21:42,048
You can't go anywhere.

933
01:21:42,048 --> 01:21:43,983
Don't be ridiculous!

934
01:21:43,983 --> 01:21:47,186
Jong Kook, we could all live together. Jong Kook, Jong Kook.

935
01:21:50,923 --> 01:21:55,027
Jong Kook, we could all live together. Jong Kook, Jong Kook.

936
01:21:57,730 --> 01:22:00,132
-What are you talking about? What’s this? -Kook Jong.

937
01:22:00,132 --> 01:22:02,168
-If you're caught I'll be caught too. -What did you say?

938
01:22:02,168 --> 01:22:05,171
If you get caught, I will also get caught, Kook Jong.

939
01:22:05,171 --> 01:22:06,472
What's this?

940
01:22:06,772 --> 01:22:08,307
I am sorry, Kook Jong.

941
01:22:08,407 --> 01:22:10,376
-What? -Kook Jong, I'm sorry.

942
01:22:11,277 --> 01:22:13,779
-Kook Jong, Kook Jong -You are sneaky.

943
01:22:13,779 --> 01:22:14,981
Kook Jong!

944
01:22:15,548 --> 01:22:19,785
What's this? A water gun? What's this?

945
01:22:20,586 --> 01:22:23,589
-What's with the water gun? -It's the first anniversary of the water gun.

946
01:22:27,226 --> 01:22:28,995
Ow, Really.

947
01:22:28,995 --> 01:22:33,332
-Kook Jong, do you know how nervous I felt because of you? -Hey, seriously.

948
01:22:39,205 --> 01:22:40,539
Gwang Soo.

949
01:22:41,007 --> 01:22:42,708
How could hyung do this to me?

950
01:22:42,708 --> 01:22:45,044
Gwang Soo, It's the first anniversary of the water gun.

951
01:22:45,044 --> 01:22:46,712
What's that, hyung!

952
01:22:46,712 --> 01:22:48,881
What's the first anniversary of the water gun?

953
01:22:48,881 --> 01:22:51,384
Don't you feel its too much to eliminate me in the beginning.

954
01:22:51,384 --> 01:22:53,085
I ate twelve dumplings.

955
01:22:54,320 --> 01:22:58,724
-I have to explain, right? Do you know why you are here, Suk-Sure-to-Fail? -I got caught.

956
01:23:00,960 --> 01:23:02,728
What the!

957
01:23:09,302 --> 01:23:11,037
Ji Hyo, it's the first anniversary of the water gun.

958
01:23:11,370 --> 01:23:15,007
-Ji Hyo! -Daebak!

959
01:23:16,275 --> 01:23:17,343
Thank you.

960
01:23:18,044 --> 01:23:19,045
-Thank you. -Hyung!

961
01:23:20,212 --> 01:23:22,615
I won't be staying here for the rest of my life.

962
01:23:24,116 --> 01:23:25,618
Oppa!

963
01:23:25,918 --> 01:23:28,921
Yoo Jae Suk. I won’t leave you be.

964
01:23:28,988 --> 01:23:30,089
What the!

965
01:23:30,089 --> 01:23:31,891
How can hyung do this to me?

966
01:23:33,726 --> 01:23:35,194
Good bye.

968
01:23:36,262 --> 01:23:37,396
Good bye.

969
01:23:38,064 --> 01:23:39,899
-Just wait. -Hyung!

970
01:23:40,166 --> 01:23:43,169
-I won't leave you alone -Good bye. -Hyung!

971
01:23:47,573 --> 01:23:50,276
There's an order, get the phone!

972
01:23:57,283 --> 01:24:00,653

JYP, vegetable salad.
