<i>The 1st place member that's others want
to disqualify the most from Running Man is...</i>

165
00:11:09,442 --> 00:11:12,108
<i>Kim Jong Kook!</i>

166
00:11:13,111 --> 00:11:15,519
<i>It's Kim Jong Kook.</i>

167
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:22,608
[Mr. Capable...
Indeed, Running Man's ultimate man!].

168
00:11:26,428 --> 00:11:30,968
[All the Running Men that wrote the name
down without even a hesitation].

169
00:11:30,969 --> 00:11:33,868
-Sorry.
-I'm sorry.

170
00:11:33,869 --> 00:11:36,274
I've never once ripped his name off
his back.

171
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,781
Everyone wrote his name down today.

172
00:11:40,144 --> 00:11:45,804
<i>Within 30 minutes of this point, rip off
Kim Jong Kook's name tag, and take him out.</i>

173
00:11:50,532 --> 00:11:53,408
<i>Within 30 minutes of this point, rip off
Kim Jong Kook's name tag, and take him out.</i>

174
00:11:53,409 --> 00:11:55,449
How are we supposed to do that
within 30 minutes?

175
00:11:56,647 --> 00:11:59,272
<i>Within 30 minutes of this point, rip off
Kim Jong Kook's name tag, and take him out.</i>

176
00:11:59,273 --> 00:12:02,490
<i>And the remaining 6 members
will go on to the second round.</i>

177
00:12:03,035 --> 00:12:07,050
<i>If by any chance, Kim Jong Kook
remains live in the game,</i>

178
00:12:07,051 --> 00:12:10,658
<i>then all of the 7 members will
go on to the second round.</i>

179
00:12:11,075 --> 00:12:14,219
<i>Running Man Survivor...start!</i>

180
00:12:17,775 --> 00:12:20,426
<i>I'm not going to go easy on them.</i>

181
00:12:21,518 --> 00:12:23,587
<i>I was going to,
but I don't think so anymore. </i>

182
00:12:27,062 --> 00:12:30,113
[1st round]
[Get this man within 30 minutes].

183
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,805
How are we going to get Jong Kook?

184
00:12:38,185 --> 00:12:39,772
30 minutes?

185
00:12:39,773 --> 00:12:41,065
I can get him.

186
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:43,718
This is exciting.

187
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:50,422
Then do I...I have to...
take Jong Kook's name tag off?

188
00:12:50,618 --> 00:12:52,103
30 minutes.

189
00:12:52,723 --> 00:12:54,172
Excuse me!

190
00:12:55,183 --> 00:12:57,204
30 minutes isn't much time.

191
00:12:58,712 --> 00:13:00,510
I'm going to get out of here.

192
00:13:01,223 --> 00:13:04,530
Hey. If we can get the tag off of Jong Kook
on a day like this, it's an honor.

193
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:07,730
-It's really an honor!
-You be honorable then.

194
00:13:07,731 --> 00:13:09,807
Should I?  I should.
I'll do it.

195
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:14,387
Jong Kook's name was written
down the most...

196
00:13:15,365 --> 00:13:17,410
Ultimately, Kim Jong Kook
was written down the most.

197
00:13:18,198 --> 00:13:23,892
<i>As you probably guessed...
if you fail at ripping his name tag off...</i>

198
00:13:23,893 --> 00:13:26,086
<i>Kim Jong Kook will come along
for the second round.</i>

199
00:13:26,087 --> 00:13:28,504
-Really?
-I'm sure that makes you really uncomfortable?

200
00:13:30,593 --> 00:13:34,860
Of course, I'm uncomfortable.
What do you think Jong Kook is thinking?

201
00:13:36,868 --> 00:13:39,884
[Mr. Capable who's busy making his moves].

202
00:13:42,344 --> 00:13:45,728
[Mr. Capable can tear the name off other
members and pause the time].

203
00:13:45,729 --> 00:13:48,639
There is an emergency exit...

204
00:13:59,897 --> 00:14:00,997
Who's that?

205
00:14:03,432 --> 00:14:04,913
Kim Jong Kook!

206
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:09,793
Jae Suk.

207
00:14:10,908 --> 00:14:12,265
Is Jae Suk by himself?

208
00:14:19,676 --> 00:14:21,825
How is it that I'm running into
Kim Jong Kook?

209
00:14:22,557 --> 00:14:24,235
Let's run!

210
00:14:24,904 --> 00:14:27,335
[The chaser being chased down by the chase?]

211
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:32,363
[Jae Suk is the one who's supposed
to catch Jong Kook].

212
00:14:36,695 --> 00:14:39,002
[When it comes to running,
he's faster than lightning].

213
00:14:46,512 --> 00:14:48,969
-You scared me! What's wrong?
-Kim Jong Kook...

214
00:14:51,068 --> 00:14:54,952
-I ran into Jong Kook...and ran away.
-Where did you run into him?

215
00:14:54,953 --> 00:14:59,513
Jae Suk...we have to combine our
strengths together no matter what.

216
00:15:00,004 --> 00:15:01,680
What is it?

217
00:15:02,284 --> 00:15:04,280
We should gather and strategize...

218
00:15:04,281 --> 00:15:05,792
I ran into Jong Kook as soon as I started!

219
00:15:05,793 --> 00:15:07,374
-Really?
-You ran into him?

220
00:15:08,331 --> 00:15:12,185
-He was hiding...
-If we make a mistake or something...

221
00:15:12,186 --> 00:15:15,367
-Suk Jin, you wrote Jong Kook down, right?
-Yes.

222
00:15:15,402 --> 00:15:16,824
-You wrote Jong Kook down, right?
-No.

223
00:15:16,825 --> 00:15:19,776
-You didn't?
-You wrote down Jong Kook, right?

224
00:15:20,703 --> 00:15:23,413
If Jong Kook survives this,
he'll go on to 2nd round with us.

225
00:15:23,414 --> 00:15:25,487
Do you know how scary that is?

226
00:15:25,488 --> 00:15:27,691
We have to oust him before we go.

227
00:15:28,328 --> 00:15:29,941
Jae Suk!

228
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,618
I thought I just heard his voice.

229
00:15:32,619 --> 00:15:35,044
[Ha Ha...lost on his own]
Jae Suk!

230
00:15:36,206 --> 00:15:37,811
Jae Suk!

231
00:15:45,793 --> 00:15:49,070
[Kim Jong Kook,
chasing down the lone ranger].

232
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:55,668
I'm sorry...wait!

233
00:15:56,054 --> 00:15:57,991
I didn't write down your name.

234
00:16:01,316 --> 00:16:07,401
-Let's all get started by going...
-Ha Ha, paused.

235
00:16:07,402 --> 00:16:10,421
It's started.  It's started!

236
00:16:10,422 --> 00:16:12,587
[Panic]

237
00:16:12,588 --> 00:16:14,613
-Come here!
-This way!

238
00:16:14,614 --> 00:16:16,397
[Who's the target,
and who's the chaser?]

239
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:19,996
-Come on! This way!
-He's a monster!

240
00:16:19,997 --> 00:16:21,541
[Rather than thinking of catching him,
their first thought is to run away].

241
00:16:21,542 --> 00:16:25,108
-We can't run away!
-Okay, fine.

242
00:16:32,568 --> 00:16:37,910
Before they all gather together...
I have to oust them one by one.

243
00:16:37,911 --> 00:16:39,696
That's the only option.

244
00:16:39,697 --> 00:16:41,977
Because if they're all together, it's over.

245
00:16:43,678 --> 00:16:45,952
This is so unfair.

246
00:16:45,953 --> 00:16:48,313
<i>There are 20 minutes left to the game. </i>

247
00:16:48,314 --> 00:16:51,248
[Ha Ha's been paused, so he has to stay
in his spot until the game is over].

248
00:16:52,485 --> 00:16:54,920
-Are you over there?
-You need to run away!

249
00:16:54,921 --> 00:16:59,135
I guess we shouldn't run away...
we should be catching him.

250
00:16:59,672 --> 00:17:01,437
We have to run together as a group.

251
00:17:01,438 --> 00:17:05,931
If we don't catch him and he goes on to the
2nd round, we'll be at a disadvantage.

252
00:17:06,729 --> 00:17:08,958
If we run into Jong Kook,
I'll grab onto his arms.

253
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:11,448
Okay, I'll rip it off.
You think you can hang onto him?

254
00:17:11,449 --> 00:17:12,692
Of course.

255
00:17:12,727 --> 00:17:14,403
And if I run into him, I'll grab his arms.

256
00:17:14,404 --> 00:17:16,110
-There are 2 of us...
-What?

257
00:17:26,202 --> 00:17:29,085

258

259
00:17:35,049 --> 00:17:38,974
He's over there! We need to go over there!

260

Suk Jin!  Suk Jin!!

261
00:17:44,433 --> 00:17:47,261

-He went that way?
-That way.

264
00:18:12,134 --> 00:18:15,203
I guess this is the
only role that you can play.

265
00:18:16,791 --> 00:18:18,981
Jae Suk, this is a very important role!

266
00:18:18,982 --> 00:18:20,837

<i>But still...that was too much.</i>

273

280
00:19:07,296 --> 00:19:08,644

282
00:19:12,911 --> 00:19:14,474
Jong Kook, I'm sorry!

283
00:19:15,255 --> 00:19:16,766
He's scary.

284
00:19:17,305 --> 00:19:18,661
I'm scared!

285
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:22,802
He...he sounds like he's going to
rip us apart today.

286
00:19:24,342 --> 00:19:26,452
I'm going to go crazy, Gary.

287
00:19:26,754 --> 00:19:31,330
I mean...what does he mean by that?
I can't even hear it because I'm so scared.

288

Jong Kook.

289
00:19:51,694 --> 00:19:55,218
I can't stray too far. I have
to listen to what they're saying.

290

Jae Suk!

291

This is Serengeti.

293
00:20:03,951 --> 00:20:06,893
First round is not a joke.

294
00:20:08,162 --> 00:20:12,228
The penguin and the giraffe are
already caught.

295
00:20:12,229 --> 00:20:16,229
The grasshopper is still alive.
[Herbivores trying to catch the carnivore...]

-What?

-Where?!

I'll just go up against him with confidence.

to go up against him with confidence.

-We're ruined!
-You had yours ripped off?

He was standing right there when
I opened the door.

That makes no sense.

-Yours got ripped off?
-He was standing there when I opened the door.

311

[He's already disappeared].

312
00:22:05,318 --> 00:22:08,873
He's a ghost.  A total ghost.
He's not a human.

313

Why are you scared?

314

Why are you being scared?
You should've helped me shut the door.

315

-Yeah, it seems like it's over.

00:23:14,434 --> 00:23:17,586
When so many people
are watching in anticipation?

330
00:23:18,415 --> 00:23:22,298
What do you mean, next time?
I have to catch Kim Jong Kook right now.

331
00:23:22,299 --> 00:23:24,112
[You should've caught him earlier].

332
00:23:25,367 --> 00:23:29,760
I should've just stood up to him...
if I had, it would all be over right now.

333
00:23:29,761 --> 00:23:31,358
But I got caught off guard...

334
00:23:31,359 --> 00:23:34,547
If I hadn't been caught off guard,
Jong Kook...

335
00:23:37,745 --> 00:23:42,089
If I hadn't been caught off guard,
Jong Kook... oh my goodness!

336
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:46,814
Oh my goodness!  He scared me!
[Suddenly aged 100 years].

337
00:23:46,815 --> 00:23:49,235
Ugh!  He scared me!

338
00:23:50,108 --> 00:23:53,076
-Ugh, he scared me!
-Jae Suk.  Did you see him?

339
00:23:53,077 --> 00:23:55,803
-He went up there.
-Up there?

340
00:24:00,546 --> 00:24:02,611
-Where is he?
-He went that way.

341
00:24:02,612 --> 00:24:08,121
-Hey! Where is he running around off to?
-Ji Hyo, did you see him?

342
00:24:17,178 --> 00:24:19,977
<i>What did you say?
You want to go up against him? </i>

343
00:24:19,978 --> 00:24:26,168
Come on...being caught off guard,
and being scared are two different things.

344
00:24:26,169 --> 00:24:28,948
I just got caught off guard right now.
Not scared.

345
00:24:31,274 --> 00:24:33,259
[The survivors are more afraid now]
He's a ghost, a ghost.

346
00:24:33,554 --> 00:24:35,164
He's not human.

347
00:24:36,029 --> 00:24:37,275
He's a ghost.

348
00:24:49,081 --> 00:24:50,820
It's Kim Jong Kook!!

349
00:24:50,821 --> 00:24:53,089
It's Kim Jong Kook!

350
00:24:53,548 --> 00:24:55,814
It's Kim Jong Kook!

351
00:24:57,725 --> 00:25:00,208
[He's hiding in such an easy spot...].

352
00:25:03,697 --> 00:25:06,603
What are you doing here?
You can't be here.

353
00:25:08,842 --> 00:25:13,108
Wait a minute...hey!
It's Kim Jong Kook!

354
00:25:13,109 --> 00:25:15,241
It's Kim Jong Kook!

355
00:25:20,555 --> 00:25:24,660
I thought you were the giraffe!
Why are you of all people coming here?

356
00:25:26,088 --> 00:25:31,999
<i>Ji Suk Jin, paused.
Ji Suk Jin, paused. </i>

357
00:25:37,142 --> 00:25:39,475
[Ji Hyo, Gary...
Somehow, they are the only 2 left].

358
00:25:39,476 --> 00:25:40,576
What did you say?

359
00:25:40,577 --> 00:25:43,825
-Do we need a plan?
-A plan?  Maybe we should stay hidden.

360
00:25:43,826 --> 00:25:48,464
Because you and I are the only ones left,
we can't be apart.

361
00:25:48,465 --> 00:25:53,127
We have to stay together
and face Jong Kook.

362
00:25:58,336 --> 00:26:00,403
It's Kim Jong Kook again...
Kim Jong Kook.

363
00:26:05,873 --> 00:26:07,808
What are you doing?

364
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:12,919
The remaining survivors
are looking for the color pink...

365
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:16,891
So if they were to see this, they'll think
it's strange and pause for a moment.

366
00:26:16,892 --> 00:26:22,200
If they see me, they immediately run,
but they'll pause when they see this.

367
00:26:22,201 --> 00:26:24,295
Are you lecturing me right now?

368
00:26:24,296 --> 00:26:26,934
Are you trying to lecture me, or what?

369
00:26:26,935 --> 00:26:28,497
-Who did you write down?
-What did you say?

370
00:26:28,498 --> 00:26:29,602
I'm asking who you wrote down.

371
00:26:30,179 --> 00:26:32,140
-Who?
-Who did you write down earlier?

372
00:26:32,141 --> 00:26:35,319
-I didn't write your name down.
-You're lying to me.

373
00:26:36,202 --> 00:26:38,863
If I had to do it...it's a given...
[Name written is Kim Jong Kook].

374
00:26:38,864 --> 00:26:40,952
I didn't write your name down.
[He definitely wrote Jong Kook's name down].

375
00:26:41,189 --> 00:26:43,296
-What did you say?
-What a joke...

376
00:26:43,297 --> 00:26:44,943
I wrote Ji Hyo down.

377
00:26:45,355 --> 00:26:48,463
-Really?
-I've never once ripped Ji Hyo's name off.

378
00:26:48,464 --> 00:26:50,848
-Really?
-That's right.

379
00:26:53,376 --> 00:26:55,568
[Pretty naive. He's believing that?!]

380
00:26:55,569 --> 00:26:59,116
Hey... how are you going
around so quickly?

381
00:26:59,624 --> 00:27:02,521
How... do you get around so fast?

382
00:27:02,909 --> 00:27:05,893
Hey... is this the jungle or something?

383
00:27:07,838 --> 00:27:09,515
-Jae Suk.
-What?

384
00:27:09,838 --> 00:27:11,683
I'll see you in the 2nd round.

385
00:27:12,553 --> 00:27:14,334
What do you mean,
see you at 2nd round?

386
00:27:14,335 --> 00:27:15,864
You're being very scary.

387
00:27:15,865 --> 00:27:18,458
Wow...you all worked together
as a unit so well earlier.

388
00:27:19,008 --> 00:27:21,426
It's been so long since I've seen you
guys united like that.

389
00:27:21,427 --> 00:27:24,615
-The one I work the best with is you.
-What are you talking about?

390
00:27:24,616 --> 00:27:26,590
You guys were all over the place
when I was watching you earlier.

391
00:27:26,591 --> 00:27:28,861
You were just going back and forth
with one another.

392
00:27:29,513 --> 00:27:32,093
You're misunderstood.
That's a misunderstanding.

393
00:27:32,608 --> 00:27:34,532
Ah...seriously.

394
00:27:35,446 --> 00:27:38,198
Why are you so afraid of Jong Kook?!

395
00:27:38,199 --> 00:27:40,983
All you have to do is just shoot,
but why are you cowering?

396
00:27:40,984 --> 00:27:42,802
Why are you so afraid of Jong Kook?

397
00:27:43,494 --> 00:27:44,867
Seriously...

398
00:27:46,262 --> 00:27:49,159
I don't hear anything here,
so let's go over that way.  See you later.

399
00:27:50,053 --> 00:27:51,847
What do you mean, see you later?

400
00:27:51,906 --> 00:27:53,894
[Because I'm going to remain alive
until the 2nd round].

401
00:27:53,895 --> 00:27:56,772
Seriously... hey. When Jong Kook comes,
you just have to shoot the camera.

402
00:27:56,773 --> 00:27:58,763
Why do you keep getting scared
whenever Jong Kook shows up?

403

3 minutes left to the game. </i>

404

Gary... let's try going upstairs.

405
00:28:15,683 --> 00:28:18,794
-Ji Hyo? What happened?
-Yeah?

406
00:28:19,033 --> 00:28:21,474
We can't find him.
Jong Kook is nowhere to be found.

407
00:28:22,204 --> 00:28:25,424
He hiding.
He's hiding because he's scared.

408
00:28:25,425 --> 00:28:27,148
You sure he's hiding because he's scared?

409
00:28:29,786 --> 00:28:31,322
There's no way to win.

410
00:28:32,237 --> 00:28:34,737
If I knew it'd be like this,
I wouldn't have written Jong Kook down.

411
00:28:37,145 --> 00:28:41,358
Just rip it off! If he comes
to the 2nd round with us, we're dead!

412
00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:46,181
[There's not much time].

413
00:28:46,216 --> 00:28:48,375
[Just where is Jong Kook?]
I can't find him.

414
00:28:54,186 --> 00:28:57,462
[Battle stance].

415
00:29:05,069 --> 00:29:09,198
Ji Hyo! We can't stop now.
There's only 3 minutes left.

416
00:29:09,199 --> 00:29:10,849
We have nothing to lose.

417
00:29:10,850 --> 00:29:13,601
We're the captors,
and we're going to out Jong Kook.

418
00:29:13,602 --> 00:29:16,068
Since we have nothing to lose,
you go grab him first.

419
00:29:17,518 --> 00:29:19,403
What are you doing?

420
00:29:20,223 --> 00:29:22,943
There are only two of you left now.
[Extreme nervousness]

421
00:29:23,368 --> 00:29:25,735
-Come here...
-Why don't we go somewhere more open?

422
00:29:25,736 --> 00:29:27,909
-What's wrong with here?
-There are 3 of you, and only 2 of us.

423
00:29:28,589 --> 00:29:29,620
What do you mean?

424
00:29:29,621 --> 00:29:32,379
Your 2 arms and neck...there are 3 of you.

426

Ji Hyo, I'm sorry.

427
00:29:36,808 --> 00:29:40,261
I told you without a doubt that
I wouldn't go easy on you today.

428

-I can't go easy on you.
-I understand.

429

-I see you as a man right now.
-I understand.

-There's only a minute left!

-Hurry up and get him!
[No time...standing head to head].

432
00:29:53,138 --> 00:29:56,064
-We should...
-I'll grab him, and you tear it off.

433
00:29:56,065 --> 00:29:58,577
-Then you grab him, and I'll tear it off.
-Okay.

434
00:29:58,578 --> 00:30:00,806
What if I get caught?

435
00:30:00,807 --> 00:30:03,596
-What do you think would be better?
-Okay.  You try to grab me.

-Sorry, I was wrong.

that you want to disqualify again. </i>

470

But can't we go in a separate car
from Jong Kook?

471
00:32:19,161 --> 00:32:22,520
[to ride in the same car with Mr. Capable
right away is a little uncomfortable].

Why don't you give him some more
while you're at it?

474

Why don't you give him 3 or 4?
He's had to suffer so much!

475
00:32:38,475 --> 00:32:41,065
He should be given as much as he's ran.

Since we know how this works now...

477
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:46,966
It seems right to get rid of the person
that's easy to get rid of first...

478
00:32:47,509 --> 00:32:53,050

a bad idea to keep him in the game either...

01:22:17,785 --> 01:22:20,445
There's no way he'd go that way.
I think he went this way.

1154
01:22:20,446 --> 01:22:22,251
[Mr. Capable and Suk Jin working together].
[Separating to capture Jae Suk].

1155
01:22:26,972 --> 01:22:28,282
I'm going to win today.

1156
01:22:36,989 --> 01:22:38,681
[Using his instincts to chase,
Yoo-ruce Willis]

1157

1158
01:22:49,795 --> 01:22:51,614
[Yoo-ruce Willis tears off the whole
name tag off of Suk Jin's back].

1159
01:22:51,615 --> 01:22:53,265
Yours was really hard to tear of, Suk Jin.

1160
01:22:57,203 --> 01:23:02,885
<i>Ji Suk Jin, out. Ji Suk Jin, out.</i>

1161
01:23:02,886 --> 01:23:04,364
Ultimately, it's between Jae Suk
and Jong Kook.

1162
01:23:04,365 --> 01:23:06,826
See? I told you. Jong Kook is going to win.

1163
01:23:06,827 --> 01:23:09,305
We should've done whatever we could
to get rid of Jong Kook from the beginning.

1164
01:23:12,169 --> 01:23:14,328
[Ultimately...]

1165

1167
01:23:31,673 --> 01:23:35,618
[Running Man's two major power players...].

1168

It's been awhile since I've seen you.
This place is too big.

1169
01:23:38,841 --> 01:23:41,879
What do you mean, it's been awhile?
I see you all the time.

1170
01:23:41,880 --> 01:23:45,180
Jae Suk. Did it make you happy
to hurt our feelings like that?

1171
01:23:45,181 --> 01:23:48,161
What do you mean, I hurt your feelings?

1172
01:23:48,162 --> 01:23:49,883
-Jae Suk.
-Why?

1173
01:23:52,409 --> 01:23:53,866
I've missed you.

1174
01:23:53,867 --> 01:23:56,639
-So...
-It's just the 2 of us...

1175
01:23:56,640 --> 01:24:00,715
The fact that it's just the 2 of us...
let's have this out.

1176

[Since the early days of Running Man,

1177

[One of the two is superior...
somehow 2 years have passed].

1178
01:24:17,922 --> 01:24:19,862
Let's do this now.

1179
01:24:20,209 --> 01:24:22,761
You're like a Spartan...

1180
01:24:26,868 --> 01:24:30,267
And I'm... more like Yoo-ames Bond.

1181
01:24:32,752 --> 01:24:34,532
I have to have something.

1182
01:24:34,533 --> 01:24:39,174
You're like the Spartan that runs,
and tears things off...

1183
01:24:39,175 --> 01:24:41,030
You got some exercise with me.

1184
01:24:41,031 --> 01:24:45,185
Even if I exercise... there's a limit.

1185
01:24:47,640 --> 01:24:51,140
[No matter what he does,
he can't avoid this battle]

1186
01:24:53,974 --> 01:24:55,749
[With this opportunity...]

1187
01:24:56,408 --> 01:25:00,837
[Let's finally find out who the top player
of Running Man is...!]

1188
01:25:06,677 --> 01:25:09,985
[Jong Kook successfully defends himself
by grabbing Jae Suk by the wrists]

1189
01:25:11,354 --> 01:25:14,145
[Jae Suk being pushed back by Jong Kook]
Wow... you're so strong! So strong!

1190
01:25:22,536 --> 01:25:28,318
If I had... if I had a water gun...
I wouldn't be humiliated like this...

1191
01:25:32,332 --> 01:25:35,658
[The tiger is playing with the grasshopper
that's been sapped of his energy]

1192
01:25:37,478 --> 01:25:40,828
-This way...
-Jong Kook...

1193
01:25:41,662 --> 01:25:43,728
[What...what is he doing?]

1194
01:25:43,729 --> 01:25:47,592
[Earlier Kwang Soo... Why is everyone...]
Jong Kook...do you really have to do that?

1195
01:25:48,684 --> 01:25:52,290
Jong Kook!  Fine. You can take it.

1196
01:25:53,739 --> 01:25:58,451
[Jae Suk lies down so Jong Kook doesn't
notice his second name tag.]

1197
01:25:59,506 --> 01:26:01,971
What are you doing?
Why are you lying down?

1198
01:26:02,386 --> 01:26:03,630
I'm out.

1199
01:26:05,649 --> 01:26:07,225
I can see it.

1200
01:26:07,226 --> 01:26:09,640
-I can see it.
-You saw it?

1201
01:26:10,452 --> 01:26:13,435
-I can see it right now. I can see it!
-See what?

1202
01:26:14,372 --> 01:26:17,988
You saw that? You really are strong.

1203
01:26:17,989 --> 01:26:19,634
How many years have you been
working out for?

1204
01:26:21,022 --> 01:26:23,513
[We thought he's been sapped of energy,
but he's starting to attack!]

1205
01:26:24,652 --> 01:26:27,575
You hate having your hairstyle
touched the most, right?

1206
01:26:27,576 --> 01:26:30,286
[Mr. Capable who's
very sensitive about his hairstyle]

1207
01:26:33,314 --> 01:26:36,634
You don't like this?
Getting your hairstyle messed with?

1208
01:26:42,404 --> 01:26:47,276
[The two go on fighting like this
for another 15 minutes...]

1209
01:26:49,177 --> 01:26:52,218
[Both are exhausted...]

1210
01:26:53,635 --> 01:26:56,821
You've worked hard today, Jae Suk. Okay?

1211
01:26:58,230 --> 01:27:01,511
[However, the one who's more exhausted
is undoubtedly Jae Suk].

1212
01:27:01,512 --> 01:27:05,446
I will make sure to get my revenge!

1213
01:27:05,447 --> 01:27:11,950
We should-- we should've without a doubt
ousted Kim Jong Kook in the beginning!

1214
01:27:13,149 --> 01:27:15,076
You've worked hard today...

1215

been waiting for is...]

1223

-Kim Jong Kook!

1226

prize that's much more grand than ever before.

1227

Does he get a chance to perform
with a girl group?
