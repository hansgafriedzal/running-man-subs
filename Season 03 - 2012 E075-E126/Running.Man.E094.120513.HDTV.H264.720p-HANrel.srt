982
01:04:07,910 --> 01:04:09,490
What did you just do?

983
01:04:09,490 --> 01:04:10,810
Was it because of a bug?

984
01:04:10,810 --> 01:04:13,000
You can't do that over a bug when
we have to rip name tags off now.

985

This is the couple glove that
the 2 of you will be wearing.

989

Just do it... We can hold it like this.

990
01:04:30,070 --> 01:04:32,850
-If this falls off, then we lose.
-So we'll have to make sure it doesn't.

[Just how... Will this turn out?]

996
01:05:01,010 --> 01:05:05,400
We can't use this bracelet on just anyone.
There's no use using it on Suk Jin.

997
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:07,270
-Jong Kook?
-That's right.

998
01:05:07,270 --> 01:05:10,920
The best thing would be to remain to the end
and use it on the other final team.

999

Finish listening to what I have to say
before you get out.

1000

You know how this is about ripping off
the couple's gloves?

1013
01:06:01,300 --> 01:06:07,300
Let's get another couple...
and we'll grab from each end and pull.

1014

All the ladies here just need to team up
and get Jong Kook.

be out by now.

Let's wait just a little bit longer.

1083
01:10:30,470 --> 01:10:32,800
We'll go out there when there are
only 2 teams left,

1084

If there are 2 teams left then there will
be 3 teams total including us...

1085

then we can automatically oust one team
since we have the reflective bracelet. Right?

1086
01:10:40,710 --> 01:10:42,660

01:14:11,110 --> 01:14:14,570
[They're scattering looking for another way]

1133
01:14:14,570 --> 01:14:16,960
[That's right... This is the time]

1134
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:21,030
You can't go! You can't!
[Scattering means death]

1135
01:14:22,380 --> 01:14:25,160
-We can't separate no matter what!
-We can't do that!  It's not safe!

1136
01:14:25,160 --> 01:14:27,710
-Just hear me out... Hear me out...!
-Okay... Let's hear it!

1137
01:14:27,710 --> 01:14:30,930
-Why are you doing this?
-Are you saying you don't know why?!

1138
01:14:31,650 --> 01:14:33,970
You're the most lethal in this game,
so we have to take you out.

1139
01:14:33,970 --> 01:14:34,750
What do you mean?

1140
01:14:34,750 --> 01:14:37,110
I didn't know he was this kind of a man
when I got together with him!

1141
01:14:37,710 --> 01:14:40,290
[Didn't know he was
Mr. Capable until she married him]

1142
01:14:40,290 --> 01:14:41,600
When he's like this...

1143
01:14:42,080 --> 01:14:45,940
We're all trying to be considerate of you.

1144
01:14:45,940 --> 01:14:49,760
[Mr. Capable has grabbed Jae Suk
and Seung Yeon's glove!]

1145
01:14:50,520 --> 01:14:53,880
[To attack in such a situation?!]
Everyone hold on!

1146
01:14:54,490 --> 01:14:58,990
[With just one attack, everyone's in a frenzy]

1147
01:15:00,170 --> 01:15:01,790
This is the type of a person he is!

1148
01:15:03,430 --> 01:15:06,240
[Using this moment to make a getaway]

1149
01:15:12,350 --> 01:15:15,010
This is too hard!  Elevator!
Let's take the elevator!

1150
01:15:16,400 --> 01:15:19,690
[Ultimately, the capable couple
succeeds in making a getaway]

1151
01:15:21,830 --> 01:15:24,610
<i>I feel like if our plan works,
we can win first place.</i>

1152
01:15:25,050 --> 01:15:29,900
The best scenario would be if one of them
tears off Jong Kook's name.

1153
01:15:31,780 --> 01:15:34,230
Right?  I wish Jong Kook gets taken out.

1154
01:15:35,030 --> 01:15:36,650
And Ha Ha too.

1155
01:15:39,930 --> 01:15:41,200
Wait...

1156
01:15:42,840 --> 01:15:46,290
[The coalition that's been after Capable Team
is coming in the room...]

1157

-There they are! They're over there!
-They were hiding.

1158
01:16:07,880 --> 01:16:10,190
-They're over there. Everyone get them.
-Where?

1159
01:16:10,190 --> 01:16:13,250
-Behind the piano.
-They're behind the piano!

1160
01:16:16,160 --> 01:16:21,100
-Everyone gather as one team.
-Over there.  Get over there.

1161
01:16:21,100 --> 01:16:23,810
-Over there? No one's there.
-No. They're over there.

1162
01:16:23,810 --> 01:16:26,510
-They're over there.
-Are you sure?

1163
01:16:32,110 --> 01:16:33,690
They're behind the air conditioner.

1164
01:16:35,810 --> 01:16:37,200
<i>Get away!</i>

1165
01:16:39,610 --> 01:16:43,110
Come out here first and let's talk about
whether we're going to work together or not.

1166
01:16:43,110 --> 01:16:45,100
Okay.  We'll talk out there.

1167

[Giving up on hiding further]

1168
01:16:48,190 --> 01:16:51,800
-Come out and let's talk.
-Okay... First...

1169
01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:55,980
I think we're going to have to
join them for now.

1170
01:16:56,930 --> 01:17:00,120
-After we join them...
-Why are there so many of them?

1171
01:17:02,190 --> 01:17:04,700
I would like to join you guys too.

1172
01:17:04,920 --> 01:17:07,030
What do we have to do for you to accept us?

1173
01:17:07,650 --> 01:17:08,960
-Gary...
-Yes?

1174

[Krystal bride gets scared while
trying to escape]

1175

[It looks as though Gary and Krystal
are going to be refused]

1176
01:17:24,300 --> 01:17:26,540
We would like to join your coalition too.

1177
01:17:26,770 --> 01:17:28,680
Let's grab Gary's arm first.

1178
01:17:30,460 --> 01:17:32,590
[If they do that...!]

1179
01:17:33,630 --> 01:17:36,000
-Come on...
-Let's not be like this.

1180
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,980
[Not even in their wildest dream does the
coalition team know about the bracelet]

1181
01:17:38,980 --> 01:17:42,890
-I'm sorry... But Gary...
-How can they do this?

1182
01:17:42,890 --> 01:17:45,270
-Wait...
-Let's grab their arm first.

1183
01:17:47,820 --> 01:17:49,870
[This isn't going to work...!]

[The bracelet can't be wasted like this!]

1185

-It's off!
-What the heck?!

[Suk Jin and Ji Hyo out!]

[Gary and Krystal still hide the truth
of their reflective bracelet]

1188
01:18:14,390 --> 01:18:18,420
How did you do that?

1189
01:18:23,130 --> 01:18:26,000
[This time... Your turn]

1190
01:18:27,640 --> 01:18:33,290
[Gary outs Kwang Soo and Gyu Ri this way too]

-Hey!  Gary!
-How can he do this?!

[Really doesn't understand Gary's actions]

1196
01:18:53,100 --> 01:18:55,580
How many teams are there now?
4 teams are left now.

1197
01:18:56,680 --> 01:18:59,380
We're done if we go up against
Jae Suk and Jong Kook.

1198

-Even if someone wins, it has to be one of us.
-Jae Suk ran away on his own.

Let's go up against Jae Suk together.
[Naive Ha Ha and Suzy]

1203

I wonder if there's another way?
I want to find Jae Suk.

1204

we're over.

[For now the game is progressing
according to Gary's plan]

in a blink of an eye? </i>

1208
01:19:31,760 --> 01:19:34,670
Maybe we should hide...

of course, this is how it ends]
