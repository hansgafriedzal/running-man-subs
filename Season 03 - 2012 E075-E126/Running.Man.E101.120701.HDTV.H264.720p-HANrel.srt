Isn't this an acrylic plate?

1001
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,810
[Your eyes will get crossed...]

1002
01:06:56,810 --> 01:06:58,500
Your eyebrows are really thick.

1003
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:02,960
And look at your beard.

1004
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:04,700
[Become eyebrows on top of the eyes,
and becomes a beard on the chin...]

1005

[Will the CSI team members be able to solve
what the acrylic pans mean?]

1006
01:07:11,360 --> 01:07:14,580
-Let's split up.  Let's go around separately.
-No we can't split up.

1007
01:07:14,580 --> 01:07:17,180
We can't split up because
we have to combine our heads together.

1008
01:07:17,180 --> 01:07:21,640
-Ji Hyo could tear the name off our back.
-Hurry.  Come quickly.

1009

[This is driving me crazy...
I can't do my criminal things!]

1010

-Shouldn't we move a little quicker?
-Don't you think he's a little suspicious?

1011
01:07:35,560 --> 01:07:37,790
-Don't you think he's a little suspicious?
-Jong Shin?

1012

[Constantly saying they should split up,
and wanting to go on his own...]

1013

[Just a quick glance confirms he's suspicious]

1014
01:07:43,930 --> 01:07:45,390
Why do you keep going around
by yourself like that?

1015
01:07:45,910 --> 01:07:48,690
-Do you have something?
-You got something?

1016
01:07:48,690 --> 01:07:51,810
[Totally obvious that he's flustered]
You're acting suspicious.

1017

-You're a spy, aren't you?
-You're a spy, right?

1018
01:07:53,710 --> 01:07:55,220
-You're a spy, right?
-I'm not a spy!

1019
01:07:55,230 --> 01:07:58,970
-I don't know anything.
-You're overtly pretending to be oblivious.

1020
01:07:58,970 --> 01:08:03,420
[Jong Shin being too obviously weird,
and receiving all the suspicion]

1021
01:08:03,420 --> 01:08:05,560
-I'm just overwhelmed...
-You sure you're not a spy?

1022
01:08:05,560 --> 01:08:09,170
[At this rate, rather than finding the gold,
he'd be the first one ousted!]

1023
01:08:09,170 --> 01:08:11,950
-Confess.
-If you're a spy, then confess already.

1024
01:08:11,950 --> 01:08:13,070
[Criminal Jong Shin...]

1025
01:08:13,070 --> 01:08:17,410

[Do Hyun and Bum Soo's secret conversation]

1029

the other agents knowing]

[The 3 need to meet quickly to discuss...]
Where's Jong Shin?

1031
01:08:37,810 --> 01:08:40,790
-Jong Shin can't come.
-Where is he?

1032
01:08:40,790 --> 01:08:43,460
Jong Shin is totally being suspected...
Oh!  Someone's coming.

1033
01:08:43,460 --> 01:08:45,470
We can't be sitting here like this.

1034
01:08:45,470 --> 01:08:47,080
We're in big trouble.

1035
01:08:47,080 --> 01:08:50,160
[CSI agent, Ha Ha approaching in the direction]

1036
01:08:51,330 --> 01:08:52,840
Escape, escape.

1037

[The criminals parting ways in
such an obvious manner]

1038
01:08:57,740 --> 01:09:00,800
Hey...
What were you talking about with Do Hyun?

1039
01:09:00,800 --> 01:09:05,130
Do Hyun kept holding onto me
trying to tell me something.

1040
01:09:05,130 --> 01:09:08,550
Hey... You're not going to rip off my name
off my back later, right?

1041
01:09:08,550 --> 01:09:11,590
-No... That's definitely not it.
-Hey... You're acting a little suspicious.

1042
01:09:11,590 --> 01:09:14,310
Why are you being like this right now?
I don't know anything right now.

1043
01:09:14,770 --> 01:09:16,820
I don't even know where I'm going right now.

1044
01:09:16,820 --> 01:09:19,140
[Bum Soo is acting strange...]

1045

get out of his spot]

[Jong Shin rushing in
from the back suddenly?!]

1048

[Was running with Ha Ha's name tag in sight...]

1049
01:09:34,270 --> 01:09:37,400
[Dropping the pretense]

1050
01:09:37,400 --> 01:09:41,020
-What?  Did I scare you?
-Gary!  Hurry up here!  Come here!

1051
01:09:41,020 --> 01:09:43,190
[Acting weird again so being suspected again]

1052
01:09:43,190 --> 01:09:46,070
You're trying to rip my name off?  Wow...!

1053
01:09:46,970 --> 01:09:48,010
Hey!  What's wrong?

1054
01:09:48,890 --> 01:09:50,290
What's going on?

[You should've kept a low profile...
Jong Shin going around being suspected]

1056

I was looking for Do Hyun...
And I scared him while playing a joke.

1057
01:10:00,100 --> 01:10:02,750
Gary... He's definitely a spy.
Without a doubt, he's a spy.

1058
01:10:04,470 --> 01:10:05,900
I'm not... Bye.

1059
01:10:05,900 --> 01:10:09,390
[Just too hilarious because just even by
plain looks, there's something suspicious]

1060
01:10:10,460 --> 01:10:13,200
[Awkward]

1061
01:10:13,200 --> 01:10:15,510
<i>I'm letting you go this time and
just pretending not to notice anything.</i>

1062
01:10:20,100 --> 01:10:22,060
That's just too funny.

1063
01:10:24,500 --> 01:10:28,770
[Poor Ace Ji Hyo tired from
running around for nothing]

1064

Ji Hyo...

1066
01:10:38,270 --> 01:10:41,760
-Jong Shin...!
-I didn't rip it... I didn't touch it.

1067
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:44,650

sought out Ji Hyo on purpose]

[The criminals need to use Ji Hyo until
she leads them to the final destination]

1069

Ji Hyo...

1070
01:10:51,820 --> 01:10:53,810
Because the guests today are a bit bumbly...

1071
01:10:54,870 --> 01:10:58,140
Right?  The guests are to help me, right?
[Disillusioned]

1072
01:10:58,860 --> 01:11:01,840
[Ji Hyo not yet knowing the purpose
and the identity of the real criminals]

[She doesn't know anything yet...]

1074
01:11:05,210 --> 01:11:10,380
[I'll have to pretend to help her until
she finds out where the location is]

1075

We almost got found out too just now.
I failed trying to tear Ha Ha's name off.

01:11:20,060 --> 01:11:21,630
Ha Ha has it?

1078
01:11:22,250 --> 01:11:24,110
I have to have that.

[Ji Hyo not even knowing in her wildest dreams
that the real criminals are the guests]

Ha Ha!  I got Do Hyun!
I caught Do Hyun!

1092
01:12:15,720 --> 01:12:17,850
Don't be too eager about it.
If you're too eager, then you'll be suspected.

1093
01:12:20,160 --> 01:12:22,000
Tell him to come to that place earlier.

1094
01:12:25,630 --> 01:12:27,240
Coming, they're coming.

[Even though he's saying he caught him...
That loosely?]

1101

-What are you talking about?
-We're actually on the same team.

1103

What does that mean?

1104
01:13:04,300 --> 01:13:06,810
We're originally on the same team,

all of a sudden?]

Just what does that mean?!

1110
01:13:23,330 --> 01:13:25,330
You told me to rip off his name...

1111
01:13:25,330 --> 01:13:29,980
-But I can't rip it off myself.
-You just have to tear it off.

originally put on the same team?

1114

-He's saying he's not going to do it anymore.

1118

-He's basically betraying me.
-It's because I'm your friend!

Are you playing around right now?

1120

of me as your friend...

-It's not her... I thought it was Ji Hyo.

1159
01:16:28,330 --> 01:16:31,160
Didn't it look like Ji Hyo?
I totally thought it was her.

1160
01:16:31,160 --> 01:16:33,740
[Everyone looks like Ji Hyo because
they've been searching for her all day]

1161
01:16:42,660 --> 01:16:46,430
[Jae Suk and Kwang Soo discover Ji Hyo!]

1162
01:16:48,940 --> 01:16:50,160
Ji Hyo...

1163
01:16:50,590 --> 01:16:52,880
Where have you been?
What are you searching for?

1164
01:16:53,380 --> 01:16:54,900
What are you searching for so hard?

1165
01:16:56,800 --> 01:16:58,690
This is really hard.

1166
01:16:59,320 --> 01:17:01,370
-Ji Hyo...
-What are you searching for, Ji Hyo?

1167
01:17:01,370 --> 01:17:03,700
Let's meet up and talk.
We've been searching for you all day.

1168
01:17:04,160 --> 01:17:05,680
Ji Hyo...

1169
01:17:05,680 --> 01:17:07,510
Then let's meet up one on one.

1170
01:17:07,510 --> 01:17:09,350
I'm not going to meet up with both of you.

1171
01:17:09,350 --> 01:17:11,120
You're searching for these, right?

1172
01:17:11,120 --> 01:17:12,260
Yes.

1173
01:17:12,480 --> 01:17:14,240
-Why are you looking for these?
-I have those too though.

1174
01:17:14,250 --> 01:17:16,210
I have one and Jae Suk has one.

1175
01:17:16,720 --> 01:17:19,080
I don't have just one...

1176
01:17:19,620 --> 01:17:22,130
-So there are several?
-Of course.

1177
01:17:22,140 --> 01:17:23,190
In that case...

1178
01:17:23,190 --> 01:17:28,760
That's why... That's why I have no desire
to meet up with both of you.

1179
01:17:28,760 --> 01:17:30,090
Kwang Soo, come down here.

1180
01:17:30,650 --> 01:17:32,310
Come down here and let's talk.

1181
01:17:33,900 --> 01:17:35,840
Ji Hyo... How about this?

1182
01:17:36,350 --> 01:17:39,050
-Let the 3 of us become a team.
-No, I don't want to.

1183
01:17:39,050 --> 01:17:41,050
-Can't the 3 of us do it together?
-I don't want to.

1184
01:17:41,050 --> 01:17:43,870
-Why?
-I can't trust you and Kwang Soo.

1185
01:17:43,870 --> 01:17:47,840
Seriously... If you're going to say that,
then you're the one we can't trust!

1186
01:17:49,430 --> 01:17:53,690
-Then you're not going to meet up, right?
-I'll meet you.

1187
01:17:53,690 --> 01:17:55,980
-I'll go see the other teams then.
-I'm coming.

1188
01:17:57,080 --> 01:17:59,290
Why are you talking so rashly?

1189
01:17:59,290 --> 01:18:02,060
-I'll apologize to you in his place.
-Come down quickly.  Come on.

1190
01:18:02,060 --> 01:18:05,760
Kwang Soo... You're saying you're going down?

1191
01:18:05,760 --> 01:18:08,770
But look at the situation...

1192
01:18:09,190 --> 01:18:16,780
[Ji Hyo asking to meet one person at a time...
What are her intentions?]

1193
01:18:17,490 --> 01:18:18,670
Ji Hyo...

1194
01:18:19,500 --> 01:18:20,720
Ji Hyo...!

1195
01:18:21,530 --> 01:18:22,850
I came alone.

1196
01:18:28,460 --> 01:18:31,260
-I have it here.
-I have mine here too.

1197
01:18:31,260 --> 01:18:33,440
What have you decided to do with them?

1198
01:18:33,440 --> 01:18:35,720
I thought that we should meet with you first.

1199
01:18:36,320 --> 01:18:38,640
[But Ji Hyo is the only one who knows
the secret behind the acrylic plates...]

1200
01:18:38,640 --> 01:18:40,810
-I don't know...
-Ha Ha has one too.

1201
01:18:41,570 --> 01:18:42,770
Really?

1202
01:18:43,450 --> 01:18:45,420
-I see...
-In that case...

1203
01:18:45,420 --> 01:18:47,240
Let's exchange them.

1204
01:18:48,680 --> 01:18:51,140
[Since she knows what's written on her plates
she's trying to earn other people's...]

1205
01:18:51,140 --> 01:18:53,810
I'll show you the 3 I have for you to choose.

1206
01:18:54,880 --> 01:18:56,940
-You can just give me whichever.
-No, I can't.

1207
01:18:56,940 --> 01:18:59,580
[But why is she slowly inching backwards
into the room?]

1208
01:19:01,970 --> 01:19:05,230
[Where do you keep going off to?]

1209
01:19:06,470 --> 01:19:09,450
[Criminal's ambush!]

1210
01:19:09,970 --> 01:19:13,200
[Ji Hyo lured him in!]

1211
01:19:14,130 --> 01:19:18,790
[They're not criminals...
They're more like zombies!]

1212
01:19:22,320 --> 01:19:25,010
[2 criminals attacking Kwang Soo!]

1213
01:19:28,370 --> 01:19:31,310
[What!  Both at the same time!]

1214
01:19:32,680 --> 01:19:39,120
[Criminal Kim Bum Soo and
CSI agent, Kwang Soo out at the same time!]

1215
01:19:39,920 --> 01:19:41,070
What happens now then?

1216
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:51,310
<i>Lee Kwang Soo, Kim Bum Soo-Out.
Lee Kwang Soo, Kim Bum Soo-Out.</i>

1217
01:19:51,310 --> 01:19:54,000
-Kim Bum Soo...
-Kim Bum Soo, out...

1218
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,850
[A relief for now that
one of the criminals has been ousted]

1219
01:19:58,180 --> 01:20:01,740
[The problem is, the criminal is a criminal...]

1220
01:20:01,740 --> 01:20:07,230
[But to get the real gold,
you have to oust your own team members]

1221
01:20:07,230 --> 01:20:10,060
I think you were just eyeing my back.

1222
01:20:11,290 --> 01:20:15,480
[Jae Suk has lost all his team members]

1223
01:20:15,480 --> 01:20:18,950
[The perfect scenario for Ha Ha and Gary]

1224
01:20:18,950 --> 01:20:22,100
-This is perfect being on the staircase.
-This is 2 against 1 again.

1225
01:20:23,970 --> 01:20:28,940
[Even though they can catch all the criminals,
real validity comes from ousting other teams]

1226
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:33,270
This is 2 against 1...

1227
01:20:33,400 --> 01:20:35,720
[Blocking his escape]

1228
01:20:37,580 --> 01:20:41,690
[The 2 kids slowly eyeing the victory]

1229
01:20:41,700 --> 01:20:47,500
Two against one like this again...
Like when Kim Hee Sun was here...

1230
01:20:47,960 --> 01:20:50,620
There are a lot of things that I've been
harboring feelings against you about...

1231
01:20:50,900 --> 01:20:55,350
[The 2 kids with a lot of grudges against him
during last week's 100th episode special]

1232
01:20:58,870 --> 01:21:01,840
[Huh?  Ji Hyo?]

1233
01:21:01,840 --> 01:21:05,920
[Is she to save Jae Suk?]

1234
01:21:05,920 --> 01:21:07,750
Hurry.  Aren't you going to oust Jae Suk?

1235
01:21:07,750 --> 01:21:10,500
-What are you doing?
-Aren't you going to oust Jae Suk?

1236
01:21:10,500 --> 01:21:13,290
-What are you doing?
-Then rip it off, Ji Hyo.

1237
01:21:13,290 --> 01:21:16,720
Jong Kook!!  Why are you picking on me?

1238
01:21:18,790 --> 01:21:22,190
[Ousting Jae Suk a success!]

1239
01:21:22,190 --> 01:21:25,470
[Jae Suk-Out!]

1240
01:21:26,090 --> 01:21:30,600
<i>Yoo Jae Suk, out.
Yoo Jae Suk, out.</i>

1241
01:21:30,600 --> 01:21:34,690
Earlier... Earlier...
I should've ripped it off.

1242
01:21:34,700 --> 01:21:36,410
[Now the biggest enemy is the Blue Team]

1243
01:21:38,970 --> 01:21:42,380
Ji Hyo... We really have to know.

1244
01:21:43,830 --> 01:21:47,650
[Sharing the plates they each have]
I'll give it back after taking a look.

1245
01:21:47,650 --> 01:21:52,000
[You don't even know what you're doing]
I know this is of some value to you.

1246
01:21:52,260 --> 01:21:56,420
[Ha Ha wanting to know the meaning
of the plates]

1247
01:21:56,420 --> 01:21:57,900
That's what I want to know.

1248
01:21:57,900 --> 01:22:01,110
If you solve the riddle of these plates,
you'll know where the real gold is at.

1249
01:22:11,030 --> 01:22:14,880
[Huh?  Faintly...]

1250
01:22:14,880 --> 01:22:18,250
[Hey... Take a look at this...]

1251
01:22:18,770 --> 01:22:21,110
[I got it]

1252
01:22:21,890 --> 01:22:25,340
[I have to check the other plates quickly]

1253
01:22:26,280 --> 01:22:28,470
I think I kind of know.

1254
01:22:30,290 --> 01:22:31,610
It's a secret.

1255
01:22:31,610 --> 01:22:32,970
[Gary's found out
the secret about the plates?]

1256
01:22:32,970 --> 01:22:36,980
[In that case...]

1257
01:22:37,540 --> 01:22:40,630
If I knew the location...

1258
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:44,330
[Where is Ji Hyo going all of a sudden?]

1259
01:22:44,330 --> 01:22:47,870
-I think I got it...
-Why did she leave this behind?

1260
01:22:49,230 --> 01:22:51,010
Hey, where are you going Ji Hyo?

1261
01:22:51,010 --> 01:22:54,920
[She's not leaving... Shutting the door?]

1262
01:22:56,880 --> 01:22:58,380
What are you doing?

1263
01:22:58,420 --> 01:23:00,810
Hurry up and come out,
so we can tear them off.

1264
01:23:00,840 --> 01:23:03,130
-What the heck?  What's going on?
-Hurry up and come out.

1265
01:23:03,130 --> 01:23:06,050
[Someone else is in the room?!]

1266
01:23:06,050 --> 01:23:12,040
[Just who is the cohort that
Ji Hyo's joined hands with?]

1267
01:23:13,390 --> 01:23:16,070
[Could it be Jong Kook?]

1268
01:23:16,070 --> 01:23:18,310
[Jong Shin!!]

1269
01:23:19,570 --> 01:23:23,310
[Zero shock]
You want to fight?

1270
01:23:24,570 --> 01:23:26,780
You're going to use him to fight us?

1271
01:23:27,550 --> 01:23:30,640
-I'm speechless...
-You're supposed to be scared when you see...

1272
01:23:30,640 --> 01:23:32,520
I thought it was going to be Jong Kook.

1273
01:23:34,220 --> 01:23:35,740
I got you.

1274
01:23:36,450 --> 01:23:38,480
[He's the one to get scared himself]

1275
01:23:38,480 --> 01:23:40,130
You can't even tear that off?

1276
01:23:41,280 --> 01:23:44,830
[Anyways, 2:2... An even score]

1277
01:23:44,830 --> 01:23:48,140
-Fine, let's do this...
-He's doing it like in the movies.

1278
01:23:48,140 --> 01:23:50,810
[Weakling Jong Shin using useless tactics]

1279
01:23:51,920 --> 01:23:55,020
-Let's get out of here and do this.
-Okay.

1280
01:23:55,030 --> 01:23:56,570
Let's take this outside.

1281
01:23:56,570 --> 01:23:59,590
This is...
[Just then!]

1282
01:24:00,370 --> 01:24:05,550
[Ha Ha slyly taking Ji Hyo's plates]

1283
01:24:06,400 --> 01:24:09,300
[Ace Ji Hyo, not noticing anything]

1284
01:24:10,380 --> 01:24:12,360
But the thing I'm curious about is...

1285
01:24:12,950 --> 01:24:18,270
Even in this situation, the first person
to arrive at the location is the winner?

1286
01:24:18,820 --> 01:24:20,170
[Really??]

1287
01:24:20,170 --> 01:24:22,880
[Ha Ha flashing out of the room!]

1288
01:24:22,880 --> 01:24:24,650
You didn't take my things, right?

1289
01:24:26,050 --> 01:24:31,840
[Gary and Ha Ha, with all their stolen plates]

1290
01:24:36,850 --> 01:24:41,680
[Ji Hyo's acrylic plates have vanished!]

1291
01:24:42,160 --> 01:24:45,310
[Realizing that it's related to water,
Gary heads to the bathroom!]

1292
01:24:49,250 --> 01:24:50,610
I can see it clearly.

1293
01:24:51,470 --> 01:24:53,360
['Reum']

1294
01:24:53,360 --> 01:24:58,320
Jong Kook!  Jong Kook!
Ha Ha has all 4 acrylic plates!

1295
01:24:59,270 --> 01:25:01,350
He even has all of mine right now!

1296
01:25:03,500 --> 01:25:04,980
'Ri'.  It says 'Ri'.

1297
01:25:04,990 --> 01:25:07,610
And this one says 'Mu'!

1298
01:25:07,610 --> 01:25:09,670
I can see them all so clearly!

1299
01:25:15,820 --> 01:25:17,420
Cloud bridge?

1300
01:25:17,800 --> 01:25:21,010
-There's a cloud bridge!
-There was that cloud bridge cafe earlier!

1301
01:25:21,790 --> 01:25:25,230
-I had 4 but he took them all.
-So where are they now?

1302
01:25:25,230 --> 01:25:27,600
-The final location!
-They went to the final location.

1303
01:25:27,610 --> 01:25:30,360
-The gold that I have is fake.
-They're fake gold?!

1304
01:25:30,360 --> 01:25:31,880
That's right!!

1305
01:25:31,880 --> 01:25:33,980
[We're ruined...
Those guys are going to take the real gold?!]

1306
01:25:37,470 --> 01:25:40,670
What about this?
Should we try shouting out the words?

1307
01:25:41,550 --> 01:25:44,610
-Cloud bridge...
-Cloud bridge...!

1308
01:25:44,620 --> 01:25:46,740
[Why not just yell out 'Open sesame?']

1309
01:25:47,250 --> 01:25:49,210
Hey!  Ha Ha!

1310
01:25:51,420 --> 01:25:52,750
We have to do it quickly...

1311
01:25:53,780 --> 01:25:55,520
Why is this split like this?

1312
01:25:57,120 --> 01:25:59,830
[The wooden door!
Is this what 'Cloud bridge wooden door' means?]

1313
01:26:03,400 --> 01:26:05,070
This is opening!

1314
01:26:05,080 --> 01:26:07,910
[It opens!]

1315
01:26:09,650 --> 01:26:12,400
[Will the real gold be behind this door?]

1316
01:26:20,820 --> 01:26:21,860
What is this?

1317
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:24,500
Is this a treasure chest?

1318
01:26:27,270 --> 01:26:30,570
[A gold safe!]

1319
01:26:31,680 --> 01:26:34,400
Come, come!

1320
01:26:34,800 --> 01:26:36,310
[My gold!]

1321
01:26:36,310 --> 01:26:38,290
[It's my gold!]

1322
01:26:38,720 --> 01:26:41,060
-Open, open...
-Hurry.  1, 2, 3!

1323
01:26:46,540 --> 01:26:51,310
[At last... The real gold is discovered!]

1324
01:26:51,720 --> 01:26:54,710
[Blue team, Gary and Ha Ha
are the ultimate victors!]

1325
01:26:54,710 --> 01:26:58,360
[Thrilling emotion]

1326
01:26:59,360 --> 01:27:03,540
[Coming in late after seeing the open door]

1327
01:27:05,090 --> 01:27:07,100
-What?  What?
-Are you crazy?

1328
01:27:07,100 --> 01:27:08,880
Why did you take my things?

1329
01:27:08,880 --> 01:27:12,260
How can you be so low to steal
them from me like that?

1330
01:27:12,270 --> 01:27:15,690
-What's your deal?
-I don't know anything even to the end.

1331
01:27:15,690 --> 01:27:17,060
[Pretending not to be the criminal
even to the end]

1332
01:27:17,060 --> 01:27:19,180
Let me check.
Are you a criminal or what?

1333
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:23,360
He is a criminal!

1334
01:27:23,370 --> 01:27:25,570
You're a criminal
and you denied it to the end.

1335
01:27:25,570 --> 01:27:29,470
[The 3 criminals sending Ji Hyo on
the hunt to find the real gold for them]

1336
01:27:29,470 --> 01:27:32,250
I told you that you were a criminal.
I knew it from the beginning.

1337
01:27:32,250 --> 01:27:35,630
What the heck happened today?
These 3 are the criminals?

1338
01:27:35,630 --> 01:27:39,790
They really are something...
They're the worst!

1339
01:27:40,060 --> 01:27:42,140
-I now know Running Man.
-Know what?

1340
01:27:42,590 --> 01:27:44,880
It's a good program.

1341
01:27:44,880 --> 01:27:48,250
[Even though they may be off kilter,
thanking the 3 guests who gave their best]

[And...]

1343
01:28:08,510 --> 01:28:09,820
Hello?

1344
01:28:10,570 --> 01:28:12,000
You failed?

1345
01:28:13,420 --> 01:28:17,070
You're seriously saying that the gold
went into Gary and Ha Ha's hands?

1346
01:28:19,990 --> 01:28:21,940
This is very disappointing.

1347
01:28:22,600 --> 01:28:24,840
I don't even want to look at you...

1348
01:28:24,840 --> 01:28:26,780
So just keep your back turned
for the time being.

1349
01:28:30,850 --> 01:28:32,630
I guess I'm going to have to step in.

1350
01:28:39,610 --> 01:28:44,230
[Next week's Running Man...
The new chase begins...]
