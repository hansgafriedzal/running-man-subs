810
00:52:03,090 --> 00:52:04,760
There's nothing in here.

811
00:52:06,180 --> 00:52:08,950
[Where are the real 3 cases,
with the name tags in it?]

812
00:52:08,950 --> 00:52:10,490
Pretend that you didn't see me...
And have you seen any cases like this one?

813
00:52:12,820 --> 00:52:15,810
[Without a doubt,
they said one was on the 12th floor...]

814
00:52:19,130 --> 00:52:21,400
[Discovers another case!]

815
00:52:21,860 --> 00:52:23,450
In a place that I never would have
even imagined...

816
00:52:26,290 --> 00:52:30,350
[Ji Suk Jin]
[Big nosed brother's case]

817
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:37,320
[The case Princess Ji Hyo picked when
they came in last in Hongdae!]

818
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:41,990
[Beast Joon Sang, takes one of the offerings!]

819
00:52:44,190 --> 00:52:47,340
[Rushing to find the remaining 2
before Running Man enters the building!]

820
00:52:51,270 --> 00:52:53,670
[This one is also a fake!]

821
00:52:56,640 --> 00:53:03,180
[All you Running Man...
Did you have a good time with the Princesses?]

822
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:07,620
[This beast is going to shred
your memories to pieces!]

823
00:53:08,910 --> 00:53:14,980
[Song Ji Hyo]
[Song Ji Hyo's case that was first chosen!]

824
00:53:16,180 --> 00:53:20,110
[Song Ji Hyo's life
being offered to the beast...]

825
00:53:21,470 --> 00:53:27,430
[Beast Yoo Joon Sang vs.
The Princesses and Running Man]

826
00:53:27,430 --> 00:53:30,760
[Start!]

827
00:53:31,820 --> 00:53:34,550
-Yes, we're the team that placed first.
-Hello.

828
00:53:34,550 --> 00:53:36,900
[Entering without a clue
about the beast's existence]

829
00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:39,720
You're right.
We didn't lose a single name tag!

830
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:41,060
That's right.

831
00:53:41,390 --> 00:53:43,360
[Handing over the final mission]

832
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:44,850
Will you read it out loud and clear?

833
00:53:44,860 --> 00:53:46,370
<i>[The final relay]</i>

834
00:53:46,370 --> 00:53:48,170
<i>[Catch the beast who has
his eyes set on the Princess!]</i>

835
00:53:48,170 --> 00:53:49,390
[The team that ousts the beast
is the ultimate winner]

836
00:53:49,390 --> 00:53:50,910
[But the hint leading to the beast
is underneath the Princess' name tag!]

837
00:53:50,910 --> 00:53:53,040
Catch the beast who has
his eyes set on the Princess?

838
00:53:53,890 --> 00:53:56,440
The team that ousts the beast
is the ultimate winner

839
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:58,560
But the hint leading to the beast
is underneath the Princess' name tag!

840
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:05,610
<i>The team that ousts the beast
is the ultimate winner...</i>

841
00:54:05,610 --> 00:54:08,840
<i>But the hint leading to the beast
is underneath the Princess' name tag...</i>

842
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:12,240
Then we just need to catch the other Princess?

843
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:15,680
Like Princess Se Kyung... And Princess Ji Hyo?

844
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:18,420
I really want to catch the other Princess'...

845
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:22,470
The Princess that Ha Ha and Gary has
is pretty fierce...

846
00:54:22,470 --> 00:54:24,790
-It won't be easy to rip hers off...
-Ji Hyo's not very easy either.

847
00:54:25,230 --> 00:54:26,760
Let's go.

848
00:54:26,770 --> 00:54:28,970
[First, entering the arena]

849
00:54:30,700 --> 00:54:33,660
The way I see it, the beast...

850
00:54:33,660 --> 00:54:36,370
Does it mean that
there's a beast in each team?

851
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:39,300
Tell me again.  Explain to me...

852
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:41,360
I just pretended to understand
because there were people standing there.

853
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:46,810
[Slowly explaining everything
from the beginning...]

854
00:54:46,810 --> 00:54:50,520
...The identity of the beast can only be learned
once we take off a Princess' name tag.

855
00:54:50,930 --> 00:54:57,170
But since the other teams are also going to
eye an opportunity to get our Princess...

856
00:54:57,180 --> 00:54:59,700
-That's right...
-We have to get a Princess' name tag.

857
00:54:59,700 --> 00:55:02,740
If we find out the beast's name after
taking off other Princess' name tag...

858
00:55:02,740 --> 00:55:05,320
We win once we take off the beast's name tag?

859
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,440
Wow... Seriously...

860
00:55:07,450 --> 00:55:10,850
But if we're going to get to the Princess,
we have to get the 2 subjects first...

861
00:55:33,870 --> 00:55:35,650
This is really bringing down
my coolness factor...

862
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:43,050
[Beast Joon Sang has acquired Ji Suk Jin
and Song Ji Hyo's case out of the 3...]

863
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:46,970
[Where is the last one?]

864
00:55:50,340 --> 00:55:56,440
[To disrupt them,
there are many others dressed alike...]

865
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:59,950
The way I see it,
these people know something...

866
00:55:59,950 --> 00:56:02,770
-Why don't we tempt them...
-Huh?

867
00:56:02,770 --> 00:56:05,560
-What's wrong?
-I thought that it moved...

868
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:07,550
-Did it really move?
-It moved?

869
00:56:07,780 --> 00:56:08,870
[Just in case that this is the beast...]

870
00:56:08,870 --> 00:56:11,260
-It's not it?
-Are you going to keep lying like this?

871
00:56:11,260 --> 00:56:14,280
-Oh my goodness! See?  It moves!
-It just moved!

872
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:17,180
[Of course it moves
when there's a person in there...]

873
00:56:17,180 --> 00:56:19,610
-I bet it's hot in there.
-Are you a man or a woman?

874
00:56:20,590 --> 00:56:25,040
Anyways... We kept having to pick our cases
since the race started...

875
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:26,900
Let's first find those cases.

876
00:56:26,900 --> 00:56:31,350
But we can get attacked while
searching for those cases.

877
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:36,710
Why are there so many people in here today?

878
00:56:36,710 --> 00:56:38,510
I wonder what they're here for?

879
00:56:40,820 --> 00:56:43,230
[Jong Kook discovers a case!]

880
00:56:44,230 --> 00:56:46,920
[A fake case...]

881
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:49,750
-What the heck is this?
-There must be fake cases hidden too...

882
00:56:52,870 --> 00:56:55,630
[Princess Se Kyung's team
seems to have found something!]

883
00:56:55,630 --> 00:56:57,280
We found one!

884
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:02,730
[This is also a fake case]

885
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:07,120
Oh my!  You scared me!
Goodness! You scared me!

886
00:57:09,850 --> 00:57:13,180
-You just tried tearing mine off!
-No, we didn't.  You did that by yourself.

887
00:57:13,180 --> 00:57:16,820
[The Princess scared herself when
her name tag got snagged on the wall]

888
00:57:16,830 --> 00:57:19,360
I thought you tried tearing mine off.
It really scared me.

889
00:57:21,630 --> 00:57:23,700
Sa Yeon, search closely around here...

890
00:57:27,070 --> 00:57:28,540
I found it!

891
00:57:28,910 --> 00:57:31,060
[Huh?!]

892
00:57:32,770 --> 00:57:34,570
[That's my briefcase...]
I'm sorry.

893
00:57:35,730 --> 00:57:40,330
She mistook your briefcase...
I'm seriously so sorry.

894
00:57:42,170 --> 00:57:46,250
[The employee taking it all in with a smile]

895
00:57:46,250 --> 00:57:48,110
-That's not the right bag...
-It's not?

896
00:57:48,680 --> 00:57:51,180
-I'm sorry.
-You just made a silly mistake.

897
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:55,280
[Wasn't that what the cases looked like?]

898
00:57:58,510 --> 00:58:02,330
[Beast Joon Sang
still hasn't found the last case]

899
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:16,610
[A case in a likely place...!]

900
00:58:17,370 --> 00:58:19,340
So this is what it's like...
This is seriously...

901
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:26,520
[Offering discovered!
Yoo Jae Suk's name tag!]

902
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:29,600
[Beast Joon Sang,
takes all three of the name tag offerings!]

903
00:58:32,620 --> 00:58:37,830
[But the Running Man are nearby!
Must use caution...]

904
00:58:42,230 --> 00:58:44,960
-Just what is this beast thing?
-Right?

905
00:58:47,550 --> 00:58:48,830
What's that?

906
00:58:49,850 --> 00:58:52,610
[The beast in danger of being discovered!]

907
00:58:59,790 --> 00:59:02,120
Someone was running with cases in hand!

908
00:59:04,110 --> 00:59:05,560
Look over there!

909
00:59:06,570 --> 00:59:08,170
-What's going on?
-What's wrong?

910
00:59:08,170 --> 00:59:10,190
-Someone's running away!
-Who is?!

911
00:59:10,190 --> 00:59:12,710
-Someone dressed in a black suit.
-What the heck?

912
00:59:12,710 --> 00:59:13,700
<i>Who is it?</i>

913
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:15,910
Who is it?

914
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:18,120
Jae Suk!

915
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:19,590
Jae Suk!!

916
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:21,300
-Jae Suk!
-What?!

917
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:25,450
What, what, what?!

918
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:30,400
Where?  Where is he?

919
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:33,430
-Kwang Soo... Where did Kwang Soo go?
-Where did he go?

920
00:59:33,430 --> 00:59:34,940
Kwang Soo!

921
00:59:37,090 --> 00:59:38,270
Where are you?

922
00:59:39,850 --> 00:59:41,150
What the heck?

923
00:59:41,190 --> 00:59:46,070
[After looking around the place...
Discovers that they're all scattered about!]

924
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:51,100
Kwang Soo!

925
00:59:51,810 --> 00:59:56,610
What the heck?
[Sa Yeon's team each left on their own]

926
00:59:57,990 --> 01:00:00,480
[Where did everyone scatter off to?]

927
01:00:05,230 --> 01:00:10,330
What the heck... What the heck?
[Beast Joon Sang!]

928
01:00:10,330 --> 01:00:15,090
[With Jae Suk wandering alone...
Attacking without delay!]

929
01:00:15,090 --> 01:00:16,500
What the heck?

930
01:00:22,550 --> 01:00:24,670
Oh...!  Joon Sang!

931
01:00:25,770 --> 01:00:27,770
-Hi.
-Joon Sang...!

932
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:29,970
What are you doing...?

933
01:00:30,380 --> 01:00:32,420
-Can I just not do this?
-Why?

934
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:35,000
You... You're the beast!

935
01:00:35,170 --> 01:00:36,530
You're the beast...

936
01:00:37,290 --> 01:00:39,710
-Aren't you going around with silver cases?
-No... No, I'm not.

937
01:00:40,230 --> 01:00:41,600
Since there's no one around...

938
01:00:41,780 --> 01:00:45,240
Since I helped you out,
you can't tear mine off...

939
01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:46,460
Yes...

940
01:00:46,490 --> 01:00:48,490
I won't do that.
You're going to tear mine off?

941
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:51,110
You can't tear mine off.

942
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:53,300
How did this happen?

943
01:00:53,470 --> 01:00:56,140
How this all happened is...
Sit down, have a seat.

944
01:00:58,570 --> 01:01:00,810
-I know you must be busy...
-I didn't want to go this far either...

945
01:01:00,810 --> 01:01:02,370
I had no idea that it was this hard.

946
01:01:03,890 --> 01:01:06,270
-What...?
-Why do I have to keep running like this?

947
01:01:07,120 --> 01:01:09,960
[But your existence is that of a beast...!]

948
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:13,030
When did you get here?
None of us knew that you were on the show!

949
01:01:13,350 --> 01:01:15,140
First, I don't have a name tag.

950
01:01:15,150 --> 01:01:16,410
Then what?

951
01:01:17,170 --> 01:01:18,750
What about your name tag?

952
01:01:19,240 --> 01:01:20,310
Let me see.

953
01:01:20,310 --> 01:01:21,910
-See?  I don't have one.
-Oh!  You don't have one.

954
01:01:21,910 --> 01:01:23,310
But you have a shirt on under the jacket.

955
01:01:23,930 --> 01:01:25,640
I can tell the name tag is on your shirt.

956
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:27,590
I said, I don't have one.

957
01:01:30,430 --> 01:01:32,980
[You weren't going to
show it to him anyways...]

958
01:01:32,980 --> 01:01:35,330
-You don't believe me?
-I can see your name tag.

959
01:01:35,560 --> 01:01:37,420
Then I guess I have no choice
but to tear yours off.

960
01:01:37,750 --> 01:01:39,600
What do you mean, you have to tear mine off?

961
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:41,600
-You don't believe me right now?
-No, I believe you.

962
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:43,950
-I said, I don't have a name tag.
-Okay... I got it.

963
01:01:43,950 --> 01:01:47,140
-I guarantee that I don't have one.
-But I can see that you have one...

964
01:01:47,140 --> 01:01:48,960
I can see the square tag on your back.

965
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:51,750
So what is going on then?
What's going on today?

966
01:01:51,750 --> 01:01:53,650
I'm asking what your mission is.

967
01:01:53,650 --> 01:01:56,430
-Are you curious about that?
-Then you don't think I'd be curious?

968
01:01:56,430 --> 01:01:59,720
You shocked me by being on here...
What do you think?

969
01:02:00,220 --> 01:02:02,390
Can't you just tell by seeing me on here?

970
01:02:02,390 --> 01:02:04,350
I'm telling you that I don't know...

971
01:02:05,380 --> 01:02:08,650
I have your name tag right now...

972
01:02:08,650 --> 01:02:10,790
You do?  So what?

973
01:02:10,790 --> 01:02:13,750
If I were to take your name tag out right now,
you'll be ousted right away.

974
01:02:13,790 --> 01:02:14,980
-Me?
-That's right.

975
01:02:15,310 --> 01:02:17,980
-If you took out my name tag, I'm out?
-You could be ousted immediately.

976
01:02:18,900 --> 01:02:21,010
That's the mission I have been given.

977
01:02:21,300 --> 01:02:24,080
So what I want to know is,
why are you going around by yourself?

978
01:02:24,080 --> 01:02:25,710
Show me that name tag.

979
01:02:25,710 --> 01:02:29,560
-Show me my name tag.
-He really can't believe anything I say...

980
01:02:29,560 --> 01:02:31,520
We can't trust anyone.
We don't even trust each other.

981
01:02:32,850 --> 01:02:34,350
You really don't believe me right now?

982
01:02:34,580 --> 01:02:36,590
I'll believe you once you show me my name tag.

983
01:02:38,120 --> 01:02:40,990
[What kind of an offering is this...?]

984
01:02:40,990 --> 01:02:43,640
The one that I locked eyes with on
the stairs was you, right?

985
01:02:44,370 --> 01:02:48,490
[He almost had his identity revealed earlier]

986
01:02:48,490 --> 01:02:50,680
Then where are the rest
of your team members right now?

987
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:56,030
[Beast Joon Sang taking Jae Suk
to his secret hideout...]

988
01:02:58,520 --> 01:03:01,920
[Bringing out the offering case directly...]

989
01:03:03,310 --> 01:03:05,170
-Don't come close to me.
-Yes, Joon Sang.

990
01:03:06,970 --> 01:03:10,060
If I were to right now...

991
01:03:10,060 --> 01:03:12,470
[Can't stand the ripping sound...]

992
01:03:12,670 --> 01:03:14,740
-You wouldn't believe me.
-I'm sorry.

993
01:03:15,220 --> 01:03:19,940
-You... Didn't believe me...
-If you rip that, I'm ousted?

994
01:03:20,550 --> 01:03:22,340
You'll be over then... Just over.

995
01:03:25,880 --> 01:03:30,210
-Joon Sang...
-I'll show you since you kept disbelieving me.

996
01:03:30,220 --> 01:03:32,600
Please... Calm down a bit.

997
01:03:33,460 --> 01:03:35,440
Then right now...

998
01:03:36,030 --> 01:03:38,070
If I ripped this off, you're ousted.

999
01:03:40,930 --> 01:03:43,750
If you go out there right now...

1000
01:03:44,680 --> 01:03:48,250
And don't rip someone else's name off
within 5 minutes, I'm going to rip this off.

1001
01:03:48,250 --> 01:03:51,430
[And don't rip someone else's name off
within 5 minutes, I'm going to rip this off]

1002
01:03:52,320 --> 01:03:54,500
-But that's...
-What minute do you have right now?

1003
01:03:54,500 --> 01:03:57,410
[Using the name tag as bait to
order Jae Suk to do the hunting]

1004
01:03:57,830 --> 01:04:00,840
It's... 10:30 right now,
so you have until 10:40.

1005
01:04:00,840 --> 01:04:03,070
-Come on... Joon Sang...
-10 minutes.  I'll give you 5 extra minutes.

1006
01:04:03,070 --> 01:04:04,150
Don't you think you're being too much?

1007
01:04:04,150 --> 01:04:07,570
If you don't get someone within 10 minutes,
then you'll be automatically ousted.

1008
01:04:07,570 --> 01:04:10,220
Just think of it as a relief
that I didn't order you to get 2 people.

1009
01:04:10,950 --> 01:04:12,160
I understand.

1010
01:04:12,160 --> 01:04:14,630
You've got 10 minutes to oust someone,
and 15 minutes to return to me.

1011
01:04:14,630 --> 01:04:17,160
If you're not back within 15 minutes...

1012
01:04:17,160 --> 01:04:19,410
Joon Sang, this is the kind of thing
bad guys do in a movie!

1013
01:04:19,410 --> 01:04:20,660
If by any chance...

1014
01:04:20,790 --> 01:04:24,010
You do get someone within 10 minutes,
but don't return to me within 5 minutes...

1015
01:04:24,010 --> 01:04:25,790
-Then you're immediately ousted.
-Joon Sang...

1016
01:04:26,130 --> 01:04:28,230
My nickname is Yoo-ruce Willis...

1017
01:04:28,230 --> 01:04:30,900
-And this is like 'Diamonds Are Forever...'
-Get ready!

1018
01:04:32,420 --> 01:04:33,640
I wish you the best of luck.

1019
01:04:34,080 --> 01:04:37,680
-The time right now is 10:30.
-You really are acting so different...

1020
01:04:37,930 --> 01:04:41,700
-You really are being so different!
-Wait... What did you say?  Wait.

1021
01:04:41,710 --> 01:04:45,340
-I got it... Come on, Joon Sang.  I'm going.
-What did you say?  Wait...

1022
01:04:45,340 --> 01:04:47,620
Joon Sang, I'll be back.

1023
01:04:48,530 --> 01:04:50,160
I'm seriously about to go crazy...

1024
01:04:50,980 --> 01:04:52,740
Just why...?

1025
01:04:57,740 --> 01:04:59,800
[Hm...]

1026
01:05:10,460 --> 01:05:18,390
[Of all things...
Why is my name tag in that case...]

1027
01:05:18,390 --> 01:05:21,650
[Yoo Jae Suk]

1028
01:05:22,330 --> 01:05:28,340
[He seriously is... Unbelievably unlucky...]

1029
01:05:29,730 --> 01:05:31,880
<i>This is like a total remote time bomb...</i>

1030
01:05:35,330 --> 01:05:37,720
There's no time... There's no time.

1031
01:05:37,720 --> 01:05:39,490
There's just no time.

1032
01:05:40,090 --> 01:05:42,240
Why did my name tag have to be picked
out of all things?

1033
01:05:45,750 --> 01:05:52,380
[I wish you luck, Jae Suk...]

1034
01:05:59,640 --> 01:06:02,110
[What is he doing?]

1035
01:06:04,500 --> 01:06:06,910
[I have to get one person...]

1036
01:06:06,910 --> 01:06:11,000
[But why are you of all people showing up?]

1037
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:15,470
-What have you got?
-I think I found something.  Got something.

1038
01:06:15,790 --> 01:06:16,900
I bet there's nothing in there.

1039
01:06:17,830 --> 01:06:21,770
But... I've been wandering around myself...
Do you know where Sa Yeon is?

1040
01:06:22,180 --> 01:06:23,460
-How would I know that?
-You don't know?

1041
01:06:23,460 --> 01:06:26,000
No, I don't.
[Why is he behaving this way?]

1042
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,790
-Well, let's just keep looking for now.
-Jae Suk... What's wrong with you?

1043
01:06:28,790 --> 01:06:33,270
[Yoo-ruce Willis making it very obvious
that he is flustered]

1044
01:06:40,690 --> 01:06:41,950
Jae Suk...

1045
01:06:42,130 --> 01:06:44,280
-You're acting a little strange.
-What do you mean, strange?

1046
01:06:44,280 --> 01:06:45,810
Why are you so busy by yourself?

1047
01:06:46,900 --> 01:06:48,840
When have I ever been
not busy on Running Man?

1048
01:06:48,840 --> 01:06:51,760
Whomever is very busy on Running Man
is the one to be suspicious of.

1049
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:54,750
You should be walking around slower,
but your steps are way too rushed.

1050
01:06:54,750 --> 01:06:56,720
Since I'm dead anyways, just tear it off.

1051
01:06:57,370 --> 01:06:58,890
What's wrong with you all of a sudden?

1052
01:06:58,890 --> 01:07:01,160
So just leave me to go on my own way
since I'm busy!

1053
01:07:01,160 --> 01:07:03,030
-Jae Suk...
-Just let me be on my way.

1054
01:07:03,030 --> 01:07:05,690
-This is...
-I'm a dead person anyways, so...

1055
01:07:05,700 --> 01:07:10,470
It's all over for me today.  Tear it off.
Here's my back.  It's all over for me today.

1056
01:07:10,470 --> 01:07:12,360
It's all over for me.  So...

1057
01:07:13,510 --> 01:07:17,130
-I'm really busy, so let's talk later.
-Your behavior is really strange.

1058
01:07:17,130 --> 01:07:18,940
I told you earlier.  So...

1059
01:07:18,950 --> 01:07:20,950
You look like someone whose goal
is very different from mine.

1060
01:07:20,950 --> 01:07:23,570
[Definitely acting like
he has a different goal]

1061
01:07:23,570 --> 01:07:26,330
-What's wrong with you?
-I don't have time to chitchat right now.

1062
01:07:26,900 --> 01:07:29,370
[Strange...!
Why is he seriously acting like that?]

1063
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:34,090
[On the other hand,
Yoo-ruce Willis quickly needs to find someone]

1064
01:07:34,830 --> 01:07:37,470
-Kwang Soo... Have you found anything?
-No.

1065
01:07:37,470 --> 01:07:40,550
-Where's Sa Yeon?
-She's resting in the room right now.

1066
01:07:46,180 --> 01:07:48,030
-Kwang Soo, let's go.
-Where are you going?

1067
01:07:48,030 --> 01:07:49,550
-We have to get going.
-Do you know something?

1068
01:07:49,550 --> 01:07:50,740
No, I don't.

1069
01:07:51,090 --> 01:07:53,850
He has a slight tendency
to go around cluelessly.

1070
01:07:54,580 --> 01:07:56,730
Jae Suk, what do you think?
You think we'll need this?

1071
01:07:56,770 --> 01:07:58,810
-What?
-You think we'll need this?

1072
01:07:58,810 --> 01:08:01,990
Well... Let's just carry it around for now.

1073
01:08:02,390 --> 01:08:03,990
Right now, I...

1074
01:08:05,080 --> 01:08:07,250
[What's wrong with Jae Suk?]
Is something going on?

1075
01:08:09,350 --> 01:08:13,110
[Looks as though he's planning on getting rid
of Kwang Soo at a quiet remote place]

1076
01:08:13,110 --> 01:08:14,790
-You're not the beast, right?
-I'm not.

1077
01:08:15,300 --> 01:08:17,650
-Aren't we taking the Princess with us?
-Where's the Princess?

1078
01:08:17,650 --> 01:08:19,680
-She's on the second floor.
-Second floor?

1079
01:08:19,680 --> 01:08:22,260
[Giraffe wanting to bring the princess along
after Jae Suk barely got him alone]

1080
01:08:23,210 --> 01:08:25,610
-I'll go get her.
-Don't you think it'd be better to leave her?

1081
01:08:25,610 --> 01:08:26,780
What?

1082
01:08:27,220 --> 01:08:30,380
If she's in some room,
I doubt someone will do something to her.

1083
01:08:31,220 --> 01:08:32,630
We have to protect her.

1084
01:08:33,130 --> 01:08:35,720
I'm concerned that she's tired...
So I want her to rest.

1085
01:08:36,750 --> 01:08:37,830
What?

1086
01:08:38,840 --> 01:08:41,340
[Awkward]

1087
01:08:41,340 --> 01:08:44,290
-Are you being suspicious of me right now?
-Jae Suk...

1088
01:08:44,290 --> 01:08:45,830
[After Gary,
the second worst liar of the bunch]

1089
01:08:45,830 --> 01:08:49,320
<i>-Se Kyung, have a seat.
-This is so strange...</i>

1090
01:08:49,940 --> 01:08:52,200
-Have you seen Jae Suk?
-I haven't seen him once.

1091
01:08:52,200 --> 01:08:54,740
-Jae Suk is seriously so busy going around!
-Is he the beast?

1092
01:08:55,500 --> 01:08:57,150
-Really?
-So I asked Jae Suk...

1093
01:08:57,180 --> 01:08:58,690
Why he's so busy going around like he is?

1094
01:08:58,690 --> 01:09:01,570
To which he kept on telling me that
he's a dead person anyways...

1095
01:09:01,570 --> 01:09:03,550
-Why?
-What does he mean, he's a dead person?

1096
01:09:03,550 --> 01:09:07,250
Then he kept saying that he's a dead person,
so if I want, to rip his name tag off!

1097
01:09:07,440 --> 01:09:10,090
After saying that,
he went back to going around on his own.

1098
01:09:13,980 --> 01:09:20,190
[There's isn't...
Much time left, Jae Suk...]

1099
01:09:25,580 --> 01:09:28,530
-Jae Suk, by any chance...
-Oh my!  What...?!

1100
01:09:28,530 --> 01:09:31,090
You scared me!
Why it is that I dislike him so much?

1101
01:09:31,090 --> 01:09:33,620
Since the last time... He scares me.

1102
01:09:33,620 --> 01:09:36,220
-I've just been with Se Kyung's team.
-Where?

1103
01:09:36,220 --> 01:09:39,530
Jae Suk... Those name tags...
I think those name tags...

1104
01:09:39,790 --> 01:09:47,050
I think someone has those name tags and
is able to control our lives.

1105
01:09:47,170 --> 01:09:51,280
[Mr. Capable accurately being able to
solve the situation]

1106
01:09:51,280 --> 01:09:53,990
-That's what I think.
-That's why we have to oust them quickly.

1107
01:09:53,990 --> 01:09:56,140
-The ones with the name tags...
-Oust the red team quickly.

1108
01:09:56,140 --> 01:09:58,430
-If we don't, then both our teams are dead.
-That's right...

1109
01:09:58,430 --> 01:10:02,620
-So quickly...!  We don't have the time.
-Your judgment is right.

1110
01:10:02,910 --> 01:10:05,440
-There's no time.
-Why were you acting so flustered, Jae Suk?

1111
01:10:05,440 --> 01:10:08,090
Whenever I run into you...
When it's just one on one, it's nerve wracking!

1112
01:10:09,230 --> 01:10:14,030
[But the real reason why
Jae Suk was flustered...]

1113
01:10:21,720 --> 01:10:24,380
Let's go quickly.  Where are they?
What floor are they on?

1114
01:10:24,380 --> 01:10:27,920
-What floor?  Let's go up there quickly.
-18th floor?

1115
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:30,000
[Yoo-Ruce Willis becoming
more rushed by the moment]

1116
01:10:36,240 --> 01:10:37,760
I bet this is it...

1117
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:40,840
You know those cases with the name tags?

1118
01:10:40,840 --> 01:10:43,660
If the name tag gets ripped from the case,
I bet that person gets ousted.

1119
01:10:48,670 --> 01:10:55,120
[You're...disappointing me, Jae Suk!]

1120
01:10:56,420 --> 01:10:58,330
Let's get this over with.

1121
01:10:58,940 --> 01:11:02,480
[A sudden announcement?]

1122
01:11:04,280 --> 01:11:07,440
<i>[There's one minute left...
There's one minute left]</i>

1123
01:11:08,050 --> 01:11:08,940
To what?

1124
01:11:10,930 --> 01:11:13,530
[Less than 1 minute left for Yoo-ruce Willis!]

1125
01:11:14,540 --> 01:11:15,740
What's that all about?

1126
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:17,890
<i>What has less than a minute left?</i>

1127
01:11:18,300 --> 01:11:23,070
[Time left... 1 minute!]

1128
01:11:24,290 --> 01:11:26,690
Listen to me... What I'm saying is...

1129
01:11:26,690 --> 01:11:29,570

-You met him, right?  He threatened you?

-Jong Kook just knows too much...
-Why is she like that with me?

the game would be over!

-Yoo Joon Sang is the beast.

-Yoo Joon Sang?!
-That's right!

The nation's leading husband!

1324
01:24:12,360 --> 01:24:15,680
There's Suk Jin.  We have to get him.
He's the beast's minion.

1325
01:24:16,520 --> 01:24:18,400
-We have to get him!
-Jong Kook, Se Kyung...!

-Why don't we go this way?
-Se Kyung!  I left Se Kyung on her own!

1333
01:24:43,990 --> 01:24:45,890
It's too scary being on my own.

01:24:51,580 --> 01:24:53,110
Have you seen Shin Se Kyung?

1335
01:24:54,230 --> 01:24:55,470

Suk Jin is weak...

1343

Even though Suk Jin is weak, you can be
in danger if he teams up with the beast!
