- So that's why...
- What you should do then is...

139
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:47,780
When a person is hit, they automatically
bend down and put their hand up like this.

140
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:52,300
If that happens, you can grab it like this,
and twist yourself around...

[The teacher's quick leopard-like attack.]

142
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:00,970
If you grab them like this,
they can't move.

00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:05,810
[A very realistic practice.]

144

Jung Geun!

160
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,280
- Did you sleep well?
- Yeah, I slept well.

161
00:10:58,380 --> 00:10:59,550
You startled me!

162
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:03,270
I heard that this is what you're like.
You really did startle me.

163
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:05,160
[Starting to kid around
as soon as he sees Jung Geun.]

164
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,100
I'm so gullible that
I'll fall for things like this.

165
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,870
Jung Geun... just trust me.

166
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:11,180
- Trust me...
- I was told that I can't trust you.

167
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:15,390
We're a team. I was praying on my
way here that you'd be my partner.

168
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:17,470
[Even though it's not trustworthy,
Jung Geun and Ha Ha are a team.]

169
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,890
I heard that there was an elder in here?

336
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:55,650
<i>Set, go!</i>

337
00:21:57,590 --> 00:22:00,050
[Huh?]
Oh! I think it's a dance song!

338
00:22:00,050 --> 00:22:02,990
[Can hear the sound of a recent
dance song flowing from the headphones.]

339
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:05,790
Her dancing...

340
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,260
Are you eating something, Mother?

341
00:22:21,410 --> 00:22:23,620
Mother, is this a foreign song?

342
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:30,360
[A lively song?
Totally immersed in the rhythm.]

343
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:31,970
Sing it a little slower... slower.

344
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:39,410
I'm so confused with the dancing.
Her dancing is confusing me!

345
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:45,340
- Are you sure that it's a Korean song?
- Of course it is, it's a Seoul song.

346
00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:49,330
[Just what could this Seoul song be?]

347
00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:52,090
- The title is..
- The title of the Vietnam song is...

348
00:22:57,570 --> 00:23:00,810
[Reminded of the Vietnamese role
that he played in a movie in the past.]

349
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:02,620
Chang Suk had to speak Vietnamese
in one of his movies.

350
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:09,220
[Is this what Mother's singing sounds like?]

351
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:13,690
- What was a word that you heard, Mother?
- No, you can't ask that.

352
00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:15,900
- We don't know the title.
- The title... is a five letter word.

353
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:19,260
[A recent five letter word song.]

354
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:23,340
It's a recent song...
[Slightly thinking of something?]

355
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:27,500
[Just what could this song be?]

356
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:32,660
- Five letters...
- I wonder if this could be it?

357
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:35,010
I'm sorry, but I don't think I know.

358
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,900
Electric shock?

359
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:43,260
<i>There's someone who mentioned this group
out of those of you who've been talking.</i>

360

- Someone mentioned it?
- The correct answer is?

361
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:50,570
[Secret? KARA?]
Isn't there a time limit?

362
00:23:50,570 --> 00:23:53,950
- Five, four, three...
- Wait a minute.

363
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:56,580
- Secret! Secret...
- Two...

364
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:59,840
- One!
- Secret garden?

365
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:02,320
<i>It is not secret garden.</i>

366
00:24:03,090 --> 00:24:05,790
- You're saying it's a famous song?
- Is it this dance?

367
00:24:05,790 --> 00:24:07,830
What is this?

368
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:09,720
<i>Love is move...</i>

369
00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:19,930
[After hearing it, this part is similar...]

370

Isn't that Sistar?

371
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:27,320
No, no, it's Secret.

372
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:31,320
- Five, four, three...
- 'Sky ground, Star ground'.

373
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:33,330
What are you talking about?

374
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:37,830
[The song, 'Sky ground,
Star ground' from 15 year ago.]

375

[Suddenly reminded of the song.]

376
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:42,910
[This is hard...]

377

- The correct answer is?
- Love is...

378

[All the hints were already given.]

379
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:48,710
Is it Madonna, donna?

380
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:52,320
<i>Five, four, three, two, one!</i>

381
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,990
[Get it wrong, get it wrong!]

[Ma-don, Na-don-na. Ma-don, Na-don-na.]

384

- Love is on the move.
- Love is on the move?

385

[The correct answer!]

387
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,590
- What was that?
- See? I was right!

388
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:15,930
[The identity of that song is this...]

389
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:20,550
[Singing with enthusiasm.]

390
00:25:23,710 --> 00:25:26,740
Your moves match very well
to the beat of this song.

391
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:30,820
- Where?
- It's the same... it's the same.

392
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:32,800
It was Love is on the move?

393
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:35,500
- I thought it was just a move for a while.
- Thank you.

<i>Listen carefully to Mother's singing.</i>

401
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:11,380
There's no way we can listen any better
to Mother's singing than we are already.

402
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:13,950
- She's so good.
- She does such a great job.

403
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:32,620
Is it the same one as earlier?

404

[Just what is she singing?]

406
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:49,100
You normally go around doing shows
like this, don't you?

407
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:52,350
[Perhaps singing because this is
what she usually does?]

408
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:56,370
Even the way she dances...
it's doesn't look like an amateur's move.

409
00:26:56,370 --> 00:27:01,550
- Is this a recent song?
- This song came out about three years ago.

410
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:03,030
[A three to four year old song.]

00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:24,950
[Extremely close.]

505
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:29,420
[Anyway...]

506
00:33:29,430 --> 00:33:31,500
[The location where these eggs are headed...]

507
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:34,150
[is an extremely large factory.]

508
00:33:34,150 --> 00:33:37,230
[This is today's battleground.
Ulsan's M paper mill factory]

509
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:41,280
Look at how the sides are built up.

510
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:44,150
[Just what awaits from them here?]

511
00:33:44,910 --> 00:33:51,390
[Today's forecast...
Action of the largest scale?]

512
00:33:51,390 --> 00:33:52,580
[Everyone, come with your anticipation!]

513
00:33:54,330 --> 00:33:56,510
- Ugh, we're in big trouble!
- It's okay, it's okay.

514
00:33:58,230 --> 00:34:00,110
<i>This time, we have a Father helping.</i>

515
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:02,280
<i>It's a song.</i>

516
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:07,140
[Only two teams left on the beach.]

517
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:09,150
Chang Suk is...

518
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:12,570
<i>The song... set, go!</i>

519
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:17,040
Are you okay?

520
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:23,620
[The lyrics are only 'Are you okay?']

521
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:26,360
[Fell over laughing.]

522
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:29,700
- Are you okay?
- No, I'm not okay.

523
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:35,260
[New lyrics?]

524
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:45,810
Correct answer!

525
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:48,760
2NE1?

526
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:07,090
- And the correct answer is?
- 'I Don't Care' by 2NE1.

527
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:09,010
[Correct answer!]

528
00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:11,760
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Father.

529
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:14,940
- Crying like a baby...
- Father, thank you.

530
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:18,410
[But was able to bring out the point.]

531
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:32,530
[Ulsan's immense 'M' paper mill factory.]

532
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:37,050
[Suk Jin and Jong kook,
the first to arrive on site.]

533
00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:42,410
[Pick a card of their choosing.]

534
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:47,170
- Number two and seven.
- Please show the camera.

535
00:35:47,170 --> 00:35:49,670
[Jong Kook - seven, Suk Jin - two]

536
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:54,200
[Other members each choose a card
as well.]

537
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:56,060
<i>Numbers five and ten.</i>

538
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:58,530
Is it okay for us to know that
about each other?

539
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:02,310
- This...
- Aren't we on the same team?

540
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,350
We're on the same team.

541
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:10,330
[Everyone completes choosing a card!
Just what is the secret of today's mission?]

542
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:19,340
- You and I are pretty far apart.
- Yeah, we are. What is this?

543
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:24,930
[Huh? What is that large monitor for?]

544
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:28,360
So we can see everything that's going on.
We can see who's being hunted down.

545
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:31,680
[A total of 16 CCTV that have been
installed throughout the factory.]

546
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:33,600
- Look at this...
- Come see. It's what you like.

547
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,940
What the heck? This is what I totally love!

548
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:37,700
You can see everything.

549
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:40,520
[Not only can you see, but you can hear too!]

550
00:36:40,530 --> 00:36:42,070
Come look at this... it's no joke.

551
00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:44,870
<i>Everyone's sitting in a spot
according to the number you picked.</i>

552
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:45,990
[Everyone seated in number order
according to what they picked.]

553
00:36:45,990 --> 00:36:48,730
[Time to announce today's game rules.]

554
00:36:48,730 --> 00:36:51,290
<i>In order of the number...</i>

555
00:36:51,290 --> 00:36:54,730
<i>you will enter in five minute intervals
to start the name tag ripping game.</i>

556
00:36:54,730 --> 00:36:58,280
[In order of numbers, enter in five minute
intervals to start the name tag ripping game.]

557
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:02,000
<i>The ones who have entered will
rip off each other's name tag</i>

558
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,560
<i>and the couple that remains alive
to the end are the final winners.</i>

559
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:08,530
[The last person to remain alive and his mate
will be the final winners of today's game.]

560
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,770
Then I guess I'm over the minute I go in?

561
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:15,970
[Who knows? Hard to tell what will happen!]

562
00:37:15,970 --> 00:37:18,190
Then... Ha Ha goes in first,
then I go in five minutes later?

563
00:37:18,190 --> 00:37:21,690
Then Jong Won way down there
will come in after 60 minutes?

564
00:37:21,690 --> 00:37:24,790
That's not a bad thing there.

565
00:37:24,790 --> 00:37:27,980
[Now looking at it, all the team
members are sat very far apart.]

566
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:29,230
Rather it being advantageous for
the team members to be far apart

567
00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:32,530
it's more advantageous for the team that
sticks close together. Just like you two.

568
00:37:32,530 --> 00:37:35,370
The reason for that is as soon as you
get in there, the other team's after you.

569
00:37:35,370 --> 00:37:37,320
Why do you analyze everything each time?

570
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:40,370
[Coach Kook's warning.]

571
00:37:40,370 --> 00:37:41,620
I'm just saying that's how it is.

572
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:45,070
If he remains alive, as soon as his partner
goes in, then they're a team right away.

573
00:37:45,070 --> 00:37:47,140
The way I see it...

574
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:50,390
As soon as Jong kook comes in,
we're all in danger.

575
00:37:50,390 --> 00:37:52,900
[Anyways, as soon as Jong kook comes in,
everyone's lives are in danger.]

576
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:56,210
Suk Jin, you have to remain
alive until I get in.

577
00:37:56,210 --> 00:37:58,470
Jung Geun... I'll try to remain alive until
you get in no matter what.

578
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:01,150
[Worrying from the far distance
they're sitting apart from each other.]

579
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:03,310
You have to remain alive, okay?

580
00:38:03,310 --> 00:38:06,580
Then Gary and Jong Won
have the best advantage!

581
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:10,430
- Well, since the both of you...
- You're both far back, so it's better.

582
00:38:10,430 --> 00:38:13,590
But anyways, it's not all that great either.
He's right after me.

583
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:17,420
Why do you only think that
mine will get ripped off?

584
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:21,080
Then Jong Won may be able to grant his
daughter's wish and remain alive for a while?

585
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:23,120
But Gary will be totally targeted.

586
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:25,690
Until Jong Won comes in,
he'll be totally targeted.

587
00:38:25,690 --> 00:38:30,990
Until Jong Kook gets in, we shouldn't
oust each other in the arena.

588
00:38:30,990 --> 00:38:35,050
If we don't pool all our strength together,
we'll all be victims of Jong Kook's.

589
00:38:35,050 --> 00:38:38,570
- Stop doing that!
- I don't know what you're telling me to stop?

590
00:38:38,570 --> 00:38:41,020
You don't understand?
When you're going off like that?

591
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:43,470
- I don't really understand.
- Really? I'll open up your ears for you then.

592
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:48,040
[So frightening...]

593
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:53,980
[Because it doesn't sound like
an empty promise, it's terrorizing.]

594
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:55,600
I'll open them up for you.
You just wait.

595
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,930
Please open up my frustrated
heart for me too.

596
00:38:57,930 --> 00:38:59,930
My frustrated heart too.

597
00:39:01,210 --> 00:39:03,560
<i>Starting with number one,
we will get started.</i>

598
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:06,830
- I understand. Jung Geun, fighting!
- Fighting!

599
00:39:06,830 --> 00:39:09,260
- Ha Ha, you have to stay alive.
- Fighting!

600
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:11,240
- Ha Ha, good luck, okay?
- Yes, Jong Kook. Fighting!

601
00:39:12,810 --> 00:39:17,840
<i>Number one. Ha Ha's entrance.
Number one. Ha Ha's entrance.</i>

602
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:20,350
I think I'm going to die early today.

603
00:39:20,350 --> 00:39:22,060
[An uneasy feeling...]

604
00:39:25,950 --> 00:39:30,160
[Thanks to the cooperation of the factory,
we were able to shoot the episode safely.]

605
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:35,980
- There he is.
- He's going in... Ha Ha's going in.

606
00:39:38,490 --> 00:39:41,750
[Clearly able to see the person
making their entrance.]

607
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:45,010
- I should really study the cameras.
- There are lot of blind spots.

608
00:39:45,010 --> 00:39:48,880
[With the factory being so large,
there are many blind spots still.]

609
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:52,770
Wow, this is...

610
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,940
What do I do?

611
00:39:57,080 --> 00:40:00,210
[Today's expansive battlefield.]

612
00:40:00,210 --> 00:40:04,120
As long as we sit here,
we can see everything they're doing.

613
00:40:04,130 --> 00:40:06,480
What do I do?

614
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:12,620
Today...
[Ha Ha's plan for today...]

615
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:16,230
There will be no moving around.
I'll stay hidden.

616
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:20,470
Today... if I move, then I die.
I'm going to stay hidden no matter what.

617
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:23,650
I'll stay hidden and get them when they come.
Stay hidden, and get them when they come.

618
00:40:23,650 --> 00:40:26,940
Not enough time on air? If I get
ousted, there won't be any anyway!

619
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:29,160
That's why staying hidden is the best.
Just stay hidden.

620
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:31,500
[What he said isn't wrong.]

621
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:37,400
[On the other hand, everyone
in the planning stages in the room.]

622
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:43,530
[The greatest change to the plan
is Jong Kook's mission session point.]

623
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:47,270
- The thought of Jong Kook waiting for me...
- Jong Kook should've been the first.

624
00:40:47,270 --> 00:40:49,060
That could've been better.

625
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:51,150
If Jong Kook had been number one...

626
00:40:51,270 --> 00:40:54,190
it would be no different than throwing in
food to the beasts in Serengeti.

627
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:58,960
[Throwing in food to the Tiger
in five minute intervals?]

628
00:41:04,850 --> 00:41:06,960
Tae Yeon, I'll come find you
as soon as I get in.

629
00:41:06,970 --> 00:41:08,330
Okay.

630
00:41:08,330 --> 00:41:10,180
Tae Yeon,
why are you being so insincere?

631
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:12,310
<i>It's because she doesn't like you.</i>

632
00:41:12,310 --> 00:41:13,770
[You trust me, don't you?]
Does she have to tell you that herself?

633
00:41:13,770 --> 00:41:16,390
No, she does like me.
We have an understanding.

634
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:18,820
- Just send him in already instead.
- It's not time yet.

635
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:21,080
He's about to have an anxiety attack.

636
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:25,930
<i>Number two, you may enter now.</i>

637
00:41:25,930 --> 00:41:27,610
- Suk Jin, be careful!
- Jong Kook...

638
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:30,700
- Suk Jin, be careful!
- I'll do my best to stay alive. Fighting!

639
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:32,560
- Fighting!
- Yay!

640
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:34,290
Good luck.

641
00:41:34,290 --> 00:41:37,140
Don't worry about anything since
you've always been a target.

642
00:41:38,130 --> 00:41:39,510
Okay.

643
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:43,910
[A different sense of nervousness
with the CCTV all over the place.]

644
00:41:43,910 --> 00:41:46,050
Among all the beasts...

645
00:41:46,050 --> 00:41:51,380
<i>Number two, Ji Suk Jin's entrance.
Number two, Ji Suk Jin's entrance.</i>

646
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:53,020
<i>I think I'm going to die early today.</i>

647
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:55,430
<i>I'm getting a bad feeling about this.</i>

648
00:41:56,490 --> 00:41:59,180
Why did I have to be number one of all things?
I'm seriously about to go crazy here.

649
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:01,760
[Ha Ha floundering all over the place.]

650
00:42:02,650 --> 00:42:04,060
<i>Ha Ha!</i>

651
00:42:04,070 --> 00:42:05,730
Suk Jin!

652
00:42:05,730 --> 00:42:08,680
Hey, shouldn't we be
joining our forces together?

653
00:42:08,690 --> 00:42:11,460
Hey, I'll talk to Jong Kook and
protect you.

654
00:42:12,750 --> 00:42:14,650
<i>We're as one!</i>

655
00:42:14,650 --> 00:42:17,020
<i>I'll tell Jong Kook and protect you.</i>

656
00:42:17,030 --> 00:42:18,370
What did he just say?

657
00:42:18,370 --> 00:42:20,750
Why is he speaking for me like that?

658
00:42:20,750 --> 00:42:22,760
- Where are they?
- They're working together now.

659
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:24,780
Suk Jin and Ha Ha are working together.

660
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:26,900
There's no meaning to an alliance like that.

661
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:29,020
I don't know why Ha Ha is aligning
himself with Suk Jin. There are others.

662
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:30,350
An alliance like that...

663
00:42:30,350 --> 00:42:34,990
as soon as one of them ousts someone,
it'll break off right away.

664
00:42:34,990 --> 00:42:37,780
- It's so fragile and breaks easily.
- Something like that isn't even an alliance.

665
00:42:37,780 --> 00:42:41,180
Thoughts like alliances aren't needed.

666
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:46,060
You have to go in and just rip them off.
That's how the game will keep going.

667
00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:49,960
Hey, just go in there and go crazy
ripping everything off.

668
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:53,790
If they're somewhere where the camera
can't catch, then I'll drag them out...

669
00:42:53,790 --> 00:42:55,990
- Hey...
- I'll bring them out to the camera.

670
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:58,610
- That's kind of scary...
- I'll drag them out in the open.

671
00:42:58,610 --> 00:43:01,000
- That's what I'll do.
- Are you shooting a horror film?

672
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:06,480
I think I'm going to oust the
two of them first. They're just so loud.

673
00:43:11,990 --> 00:43:15,000
- Byung Ho, fighting
- Fighting!

674
00:43:15,010 --> 00:43:17,690
I will not be the first
to be eliminated today.

675
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:23,030
[Byung Ho had his name tag ripped
last week during his mission.]

676
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:28,590
[Therefore, he wasn't able to
chase anybody down.]

677
00:43:28,590 --> 00:43:31,190
Don't worry.
I will wait for you to show.

678
00:43:31,190 --> 00:43:34,190
[Byung Ho taking off with a firm
determination today.]

679
00:43:38,620 --> 00:43:43,520
[For his daughters who will be
watching this from home today, please...]

680
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:44,830
This is frightening.

681
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:52,580
Wow... that machine is enormous.

682
00:43:55,590 --> 00:43:57,930
I'm nervous and
having trouble breathing right now.

683
00:43:57,930 --> 00:44:00,260
I've never done a race like this before.

684
00:44:00,270 --> 00:44:01,630
I've never ripped off any name tags before.

685
00:44:01,630 --> 00:44:05,130
But I'll make sure I'm not
the first to be eliminated today.

686
00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:07,360
I'm going to make sure to remain alive.

687
00:44:07,930 --> 00:44:10,680
Even if this factory breaks down in half...

688
00:44:11,710 --> 00:44:15,900
[His vow that can be heard by everyone.]

689
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:21,820
[His vow and determination sound so cute!]

690
00:44:21,820 --> 00:44:24,120
- Isn't this first for you too?
- It's my first time too.

691
00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:28,790
[The quiet next player up.]

692
00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:34,780
Chang Suk...
you look really serious right now.

693
00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:36,040
It's because I'm nervous.

694
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:41,170
I went to rip Ha Ha's off yesterday,
but had mine torn off by Gary instead.

695
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:44,870
Ha Ha, and Suk Jin both...
they're the icons when it comes to betrayal.

696
00:44:44,870 --> 00:44:47,240
They're icons of betrayals.
You can't trust them.

697
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,080
[Please last through it, Byung Ho.]

698
00:44:54,850 --> 00:44:58,290
[Committing himself to the game...]

699
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:01,600
Why can't I hear Suk Jin at all?

700
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:04,330
- Where's Ha Ha?
- I'm afraid he's going to go after Suk Jin.

701
00:45:04,330 --> 00:45:07,470
<i>Ha Ha has to oust the others
before Kim Jong Kook arrives.</i>

702
00:45:07,470 --> 00:45:10,790
<i>I have to oust Ha Ha first no matter what.
I think Ha Ha will be after me.</i>

703
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,910
I was really shocked yesterday, Byung Ho.
These aren't that easy to rip off, right?

704
00:45:19,590 --> 00:45:22,550
- Since the name tag is larger today...
- It's been five minutes.

705
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:25,390
- It's been five minutes.
- What? Five minutes?

706
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:28,940
- Since I have to wait for so long...
- Jong Won is counting.

707
00:45:28,940 --> 00:45:32,190
- Chang Suk... good luck!
- Chang Suk, fighting!

708
00:45:32,190 --> 00:45:33,960
[Stay alive!]

709
00:45:35,250 --> 00:45:38,390
- I think he will be spotted easily.
- You think he'll be back soon?

710
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,760
[I'm coming!]

711
00:45:47,350 --> 00:45:49,090
Chang Suk is surprisingly weak.

712
00:45:50,690 --> 00:45:54,360
[Unlike the way he looks,
Chang Suk is more feminine than expected.]

713
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:59,840
<i>[Number four, Go Chang Suk's entrance.
Number four, Go Chang Suk's entrance.]</i>

714
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:01,060
Hurry, let's hurry.

715
00:46:03,330 --> 00:46:06,480
Once Jae Suk comes in,
they're both going to be after me.

716
00:46:08,060 --> 00:46:10,190
Before that happens...

717
00:46:10,190 --> 00:46:11,610
I need to eliminate him.

718
00:46:12,270 --> 00:46:16,800
His thought of attacking Jae Suk's team...
that's the right way of thinking right now.

719
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:19,400
How can you say that when I'm
sitting right next to you?

720
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:24,270
Until you get in there,
it's between them right now.

721
00:46:26,610 --> 00:46:29,050
I'm getting scared.

722
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:34,050
The thing that Suk Jin needs to be doing is
to get next to Ha Ha and eliminate him.

723
00:46:34,050 --> 00:46:36,520
- Yeah, he needs to eliminate him.
- What in the world is he doing instead?

724
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:39,060
[Ha Ha's my partner!]

725
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:41,620
- What is he doing? Ha Ha...
- He needs to eliminate Ha Ha!

726
00:46:41,620 --> 00:46:42,920
Suk Jin, eliminate Ha Ha!

727
00:46:42,930 --> 00:46:46,580
- And if Byung Ho or Chang Suk gets close...
- He needs to oust Byung Ho first.

728
00:46:46,580 --> 00:46:49,910
- Number five, Tae Yeon...
- Get in there and...

729
00:46:49,910 --> 00:46:54,090
- You have to destroy everyone in there.
- I understand.

730
00:46:54,090 --> 00:46:57,630
[Will she be able to turn herself
into a giant player?]

731
00:46:57,630 --> 00:46:59,400
[Be careful, Tae Yeon!]

732
00:47:03,460 --> 00:47:06,730
[Even though she may look weak,
she has experience being on Running Man!]

733
00:47:06,730 --> 00:47:10,200
[Pay attention to my shining self...]

734
00:47:14,430 --> 00:47:18,770
Tae Yeon has to remain alive...
for us to have a chance at Jong Kook.

735
00:47:18,770 --> 00:47:21,220
The only person Jong Kook will never be
able to eliminate is Tae Yeon.

736
00:47:27,510 --> 00:47:30,020
[It's a camera.]

737
00:47:31,090 --> 00:47:34,390
[Even though she's nervous,
camera fun time takes priority.]

738
00:47:34,390 --> 00:47:36,790
- Tae Yeon is on number 14.
- There's Tae Yeon!

739
00:47:37,290 --> 00:47:40,090
Just hold out for a little while.
I'll be in there soon.

740
00:47:40,090 --> 00:47:42,500
I will protect you. Tae Yeon!

741
00:47:44,550 --> 00:47:48,000
<i>I think the viewer's anticipation will be
very high since Yoo Jae Suk is next.</i>

742
00:47:48,010 --> 00:47:49,580
Please don't say things like that.

743
00:47:49,580 --> 00:47:53,270
The viewer's anticipation is growing.
Why? Because I go in after you.

744
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:56,170
Higher, higher, higher!

745
00:47:57,610 --> 00:48:01,800
Higher, higher, higher...
their anticipation is getting so high. High!

746
00:48:02,670 --> 00:48:05,970
Everything will turn into chaos
the moment he steps in there.

747
00:48:05,970 --> 00:48:07,530
Higher, higher, higher!

748
00:48:07,530 --> 00:48:09,870
- Yoo Jae Suk will enter in three minutes.
- Okay.

749
00:48:10,470 --> 00:48:14,570
Somehow... I'll have to eliminate at least
one person within those five minutes.

750
00:48:15,810 --> 00:48:19,550
- If you don't, it'll be dangerous.
- So there's a reason why you all work out...

751
00:48:19,550 --> 00:48:22,100
- Why?
- I see why you guys all work out.

752
00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:24,570
If we didn't work out,
there's no way we can stand this.

753
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:30,290
Chang Suk is in camera two range...

754
00:48:30,850 --> 00:48:34,640
[Chang Suk keeping himself
well hidden for now.]

755
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:38,430
There he is, there he is.

756
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:41,700
- There he comes.
- Where? Where?

757
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:44,120
[Such Jin, Ha Ha, and Chang Suk
all have discovered each other.]

758
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:47,150
Here. Stay here,
and I swear I won't eliminate you.

759
00:48:47,150 --> 00:48:51,040
[Suk Jin and Ha Ha seeming to team up
to eliminate Chang Suk of the Blue team.]

760
00:48:52,030 --> 00:48:53,780
The stairs... he's by the stairs.

761
00:48:53,780 --> 00:48:55,920
- Go Chang Suk... it's Chang Suk.
- Right?

762
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:58,200
[Heading off to attack his goal, Chang Suk!]

763
00:49:00,170 --> 00:49:01,710
I think he's coming after me!

764
00:49:02,980 --> 00:49:09,490
[Will Chang Suk be able to last until
his teammate Jae Suk arrives?]

765
00:49:17,410 --> 00:49:19,800
- What if this doesn't make the cut?
- Chang Suk is already exhausted.

766
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:24,360
Please Suk Jin, please!

767
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:28,470
I have to oust two of them before
Kim Jong Kook steps into the arena!

768
00:49:29,290 --> 00:49:32,190
<i>Yoo Jae Suk, time to make your
entrance in one minute.</i>

769
00:49:35,130 --> 00:49:40,480
[His teammate Chang Suk is in danger!
Chang Suk has to stick through it somehow...]

770
00:49:46,010 --> 00:49:48,950
[Ha Ha and Suk Jin surrounding Chang Suk.]

771
00:49:48,950 --> 00:49:50,310
There's no time. Hurry!

772
00:49:53,790 --> 00:49:56,900
[Ha Ha and Suk Jin corralling Chang Suk.]

773
00:50:01,740 --> 00:50:04,050
Hurry up before someone else enters.

774
00:50:04,050 --> 00:50:06,030
- If Jae Suk gets in...
- Not Jae Suk, we can't let that happen.

775
00:50:06,030 --> 00:50:08,920
<i> Not Jae Suk, we can't let that happen.</i>

776
00:50:09,930 --> 00:50:11,410
It's not that you can't let me come in...

777
00:50:11,410 --> 00:50:15,080
[I need to get in and rescue Chang Suk!]

778
00:50:18,270 --> 00:50:21,120
He should be eliminating Ha Ha...
I'm getting the feeling...

779
00:50:21,130 --> 00:50:25,320
<i>Number six, Yoo Jae Suk entering.
Number six, Yoo Jae Suk entering.</i>

780
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:28,780
Hurry! Hurry!
Eliminate Chang Suk quickly!

781
00:50:28,780 --> 00:50:30,580
Hurry up and oust Chang Suk!

782
00:50:32,790 --> 00:50:35,900
[Yoo-ruce Willis rises!]

783
00:50:37,770 --> 00:50:42,050
- If I eliminate you...
- It's Jae Suk! Hurry up and eliminate him!

784
00:50:42,050 --> 00:50:45,190
- Jae Suk... Jae Suk's on his way. Hurry!
- I got it!

785
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:50,970
[It's that way!]

786
00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:56,590
[Everyone's on their feet watching!]

787
00:50:56,590 --> 00:50:59,200
Jae Suk's at a too big of a disadvantage.
How is he going to beat them?

788
00:51:00,270 --> 00:51:02,260
<i>- Hurry up before Jae Suk gets here!
- I got it!</i>

789
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:06,740
[Wound up tight with nervousness
and not able to freely make a move.]

790
00:51:06,740 --> 00:51:09,890
- Get in there and quickly...
- Suk Jin, you get in there.

791
00:51:09,890 --> 00:51:12,400
- We have to quickly...
- Hurry, we're on the same team!

792
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:14,210
Who is that? It's Byung Ho...

793
00:51:17,380 --> 00:51:20,370
[Oh... Ha Ha, you're not...]

794
00:51:26,770 --> 00:51:29,610
[Ha Ha eliminate Ji Suk Jin
of the Green Team!]

795
00:51:29,610 --> 00:51:31,320
Take a step back for now.

796
00:51:35,970 --> 00:51:38,400
- I think Suk Jin's been eliminated!
- Suk Jin's been eliminated.

797
00:51:40,570 --> 00:51:42,890
Wow... that Ha Ha... wow...

798
00:51:42,890 --> 00:51:45,100
- You really are...
- I'm sorry!

799
00:51:45,100 --> 00:51:48,500
[His sin is being on the same team
with Mr. Capable.]

800
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:50,480
Race start.

801
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:52,550
It's been a long time since
I've been able to say that.

802
00:51:55,410 --> 00:51:59,170
[On the other hand, Yoo-ruce Willis
is heading off to save Chang Suk!]

803
00:51:59,170 --> 00:52:02,010
- Where's Jae Suk?
- Why don't you sit down?

804
00:52:03,390 --> 00:52:06,680
[Even though he's trying to calm down,
he keeps rising off his seat.]

805
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:09,460
Ha Ha's mine... Ha Ha's mine.

806
00:52:11,710 --> 00:52:13,110
Chang Suk!

807
00:52:14,050 --> 00:52:15,860
Jae Suk's on his way... he's coming.
Byung Ho...

808
00:52:15,860 --> 00:52:17,800
Jae Suk's coming. Hurry.

809
00:52:25,950 --> 00:52:28,650
- There's Tae Yeon on camera number seven!
- Chang Suk!

810
00:52:31,430 --> 00:52:33,290
[Ha Ha fully attacking Chang Suk!]

811
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:40,590
Chang Suk!

812
00:52:44,210 --> 00:52:47,790
[Ha Ha and Byung Ho concentrating
on attacking Chang Suk.]

813
00:52:47,790 --> 00:52:49,040
Chang Suk!

814
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:51,040
Hurry! We have to eliminate him!

815
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:55,340
Jae Suk!

816
00:53:08,900 --> 00:53:12,400
[Chang Suk eliminates Ha Ha and
Byung Ho eliminates Chang Suk!]

817
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:17,280
[Ha Ha and Chang Suk simultaneously
get eliminated!]

818
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:23,250
Who got eliminated?

819
00:53:23,250 --> 00:53:26,190
[Due to the CCTV blind spot,
they were only able to hear the audio!]

820
00:53:27,300 --> 00:53:28,960
Where are they? Where are they?

821
00:53:41,330 --> 00:53:45,020
<i>Come on Suk Jin...
you shouldn't have trusted Ha Ha!</i>

822
00:53:46,950 --> 00:53:49,290
Suk Jin...
you shouldn't have trusted Ha Ha.

823
00:53:49,290 --> 00:53:51,770
- Did you see?
- We can hear everything in here.

824
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:56,500
This last spot is the first.
You're nothing but a target being out there.

825
00:53:56,500 --> 00:54:00,880
- The ones who are in jail... please sit.
- I am in jail!

826
00:54:02,630 --> 00:54:05,520
Hey, also... just eliminate whomever you see.

827
00:54:06,670 --> 00:54:08,600
You can't trust Ha Ha.

828
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:10,680
<i>Number seven,
Kim Jong Kook's entrance.</i>

829
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:18,870
[Its opening... the gates to hell.]

830
00:54:20,710 --> 00:54:22,370
It's starting... it's starting.

831
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:28,420
<i>[Number seven, Kim Jong Kook's entrance.
Number seven, Kim Jong Kook's entrance.]</i>

832
00:54:28,420 --> 00:54:32,100
[There's no comparison to the
nervousness felt now.]

833
00:54:36,700 --> 00:54:40,320
[Finally, Mr. Capable's entrance!]

834
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:48,710
[The Tiger's chase, an immense
competition with his entrance...]

835
00:54:52,460 --> 00:54:53,930
Green!

836
00:54:53,930 --> 00:54:58,430
- That's Jong Kook.
- Look at how much ease he has.

837
00:54:58,430 --> 00:55:03,200
Wow with Jong Kook's entrance...
there's nowhere to go now.

838
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:22,740
[Jong Kook!]

839
00:55:25,650 --> 00:55:27,030
It's Tae Yeon!

840
00:55:37,990 --> 00:55:39,020
What's wrong?

841
00:55:39,030 --> 00:55:40,750
Don't cry!

842
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:43,830
You have to stay hidden, you fool.

843
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:49,200
[Ten years shaved off her life.]

844
00:55:50,190 --> 00:55:54,630
[But Mr. Capable isn't the only one
that she needs to be cautious of...]

845
00:55:57,710 --> 00:55:59,690
I can't see Tae Yeon anywhere... Tae Yeon.

846
00:56:00,910 --> 00:56:02,750
I know that she's got to be
around here somewhere.

847
00:56:02,750 --> 00:56:04,540
I know she has to be...

848
00:56:04,540 --> 00:56:06,230
Tae Yeon's not dead yet, right?

849
00:56:21,350 --> 00:56:23,580
[Byung Ho has Tae Yeon in his target range!]

850
00:56:28,510 --> 00:56:31,780
[Planning on ambushing her from afar.]

851
00:56:34,220 --> 00:56:35,740
Number 16... number 16.

852
00:56:35,740 --> 00:56:38,500
Wow! Byung Ho... he's creeping up on her.

853
00:56:38,510 --> 00:56:39,890
She has to stay hidden.

854
00:56:48,940 --> 00:56:50,220
Tae Yeon, Tae Yeon...

855
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:56,320
[She escaped here from Mr. Capable,
only to find Byung Ho closing in on her!]

856
00:56:56,320 --> 00:56:58,840
Tae Yeon... Tae Yeon...

857
00:56:58,840 --> 00:57:01,150
[With no one to help her,
escaping is her priority.]

858
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:02,580
Tae Yeon...

859
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:06,620
They've encountered each other.
They've encountered each other.

860
00:57:06,620 --> 00:57:08,740
Run, run, run!

861
00:57:11,670 --> 00:57:13,220
I'm so scared.

862
00:57:13,630 --> 00:57:16,040
Wow... what a waste. What a waste.

863
00:57:16,040 --> 00:57:18,320
[Byung Ho just frightening her
without giving her the chase.]

864
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:20,060
Run, run, run!

865
00:57:22,330 --> 00:57:24,220
<i>Everyone that's in jail, please have a seat.</i>

866
00:57:24,230 --> 00:57:25,790
My legs feel cramped.

867
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:28,240
Aren't we the ones that started off the race?

868
00:57:28,940 --> 00:57:30,270
Let us at least watch.

869
00:57:30,270 --> 00:57:31,830
I'll keep my mouth closed.

870
00:57:35,450 --> 00:57:41,770
[On the other hand, Yoo-ruce Willis
who wasn't able to save Chang Suk...]

871
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:48,150
<i>[Number eight, Gary's entrance.
Number eight, Gary's entrance.]</i>

872
00:57:53,860 --> 00:57:55,670
Everything's so wide open here.

873
00:57:57,590 --> 00:58:01,610
[Yoo-ruce Willis keeping his eye on Gary
and closing in on him.]

874
00:58:09,020 --> 00:58:10,850
<i>It's over! It's over for Gary
as soon as he makes his entrance!</i>

875
00:58:10,850 --> 00:58:12,760
<i>You have to make a run for it!</i>

876
00:58:13,770 --> 00:58:14,970
Where is he? Where?

877
00:58:14,970 --> 00:58:17,190
- Where is he?
- We can't see.

878
00:58:17,190 --> 00:58:19,650
[Jail birds can't get a clear view
of the CCTV.]

879
00:58:19,650 --> 00:58:22,130
Can't you turn it around a bit?
So that from jail...

880
00:58:22,130 --> 00:58:23,780
Let us at least watch.

881
00:58:23,780 --> 00:58:24,870
<i>No, you can't.</i>

882
00:58:24,870 --> 00:58:26,470
Can't you turn it around a little?

883
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:33,070
[Gary not even dreaming of
Jae Suk's attack.]

884
00:58:39,900 --> 00:58:42,640
[Will Gary be ousted within a minute
of him making an entrance?]

885
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:44,910
[There he goes!]

886
00:58:47,250 --> 00:58:50,000
[Gary just had 10 years
shaved off of his life!]

887
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:56,230
[My partner Gary!]

888
00:58:56,230 --> 00:58:57,530
You startled me!

889
00:58:57,530 --> 00:59:00,930
[The ambush unfortunately gets foiled.]

890
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:04,620
We can't make any loud noises right now.
Then Jong Kook...

891
00:59:04,620 --> 00:59:07,350
Later... watch your back.

892
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:10,190
He totally caught me off guard.

893
00:59:13,240 --> 00:59:15,200
[Too bad...]

894
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:19,770
[But for some reason...
I'm getting a good feeling about today...]

895
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:26,020
[The more players entering the game,
the more competitive it gets...]

896
00:59:28,790 --> 00:59:30,300
Ji Hyo, you can hear me, right?

897
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:38,360
I have made alliances and am keeping
an eye on things, so don't worry.

898
00:59:39,110 --> 00:59:40,150
Okay?

899
00:59:40,890 --> 00:59:42,500
Byung Ho is speaking to you, Ji Hyo.

900
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:45,430
- I'm keeping an eye on things...
- He's speaking to you.

901
00:59:45,430 --> 00:59:47,990
- I mean to you, Ji Hyo.
- What did you say?

902
00:59:55,010 --> 00:59:57,210
[Who's that?]

903
00:59:58,240 --> 01:00:01,690
[Tae Yeon gathering her courage
to surprise attack Byung Ho!]

904
01:00:10,420 --> 01:00:12,350
[But gets caught instead?]

905
01:00:13,320 --> 01:00:16,250
[Byung Ho with his hands on
Tae Yeon's name tag!]

906
01:00:21,110 --> 01:00:23,610
[Tae Yeon - Out!]

907
01:00:23,610 --> 01:00:27,370
[Not even hesitating heartless killer!]

908
01:00:29,910 --> 01:00:31,410
What the heck is this?

909
01:00:33,490 --> 01:00:34,990
I heard someone's name tag
being ripped off.

910
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:36,360
Who was that?

911
01:00:36,360 --> 01:00:37,630
Was it Tae Yeon?

912
01:00:37,640 --> 01:00:39,340
Byung Ho eliminated her.

913
01:00:40,390 --> 01:00:42,290
- Byung Ho got her.
- Tae Yeon's ousted?

914
01:00:42,990 --> 01:00:46,200
- Why would he... isn't that too much?
- Byung Ho got her.

915
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:50,310
What the heck is this?

916
01:00:54,790 --> 01:00:56,480
<i>Tae Yeon's out?</i>

917
01:00:57,960 --> 01:01:01,360
Fighting! You have to show them
what you have!

918
01:01:02,330 --> 01:01:04,900
Eun Ji's dad, fighting!
This is for Eun Ji!

919
01:01:04,900 --> 01:01:06,890
You have to stay hidden!

920
01:01:06,890 --> 01:01:12,460
[You have to stay alive for a long time
for your daughters watching at home...]

[All the father's weak to their daughters
slowly making their entrance one by one.]

923
01:01:24,890 --> 01:01:26,410
I was totally caught off guard.

924
01:01:26,410 --> 01:01:29,160
I thought that she was going to
get my name tag.

925
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:32,320
It was fortunate that she was a girl.
Tae Yeon, I'm really sorry.

926
01:01:32,320 --> 01:01:34,940
I let you live,
but why did you attack me?

927
01:01:34,940 --> 01:01:36,660
[A video message to Tae Yeon this time.]

928
01:01:36,660 --> 01:01:39,870
Tae Yeon, I'm sorry.
But I have to protect Ji Hyo.

929
01:01:39,870 --> 01:01:41,550
No matter what, I have to remain alive
until Ji Hyo gets here.

930
01:01:41,550 --> 01:01:43,230
I'm going to make sure to survive today.

931
01:01:44,850 --> 01:01:47,790
<i>I have to protect Ji Hyo.
I have to stay alive no matter what.</i>

932

in order to survive for a long time.]

[Of all places, why does Mr. Capable...]

935
01:02:04,280 --> 01:02:05,470
Jung Geun!

936
01:02:06,120 --> 01:02:08,480
[Orange team's Tae Yeon walking into jail.]

937
01:02:09,160 --> 01:02:10,560
Kwang Soo!

938
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:12,430
- Tae Yeon...
- Tae Yeon...

939
01:02:12,440 --> 01:02:13,960
<i>You fool!</i>

940
01:02:14,450 --> 01:02:17,040
I told you to be careful and
just stay hidden!

941
01:02:18,210 --> 01:02:20,940
I seriously was staying hidden...

942
01:02:20,940 --> 01:02:23,380
- Who eliminated you?
- Mr. Son Byung Ho...

943
01:02:23,380 --> 01:02:26,130
- Really?
- I guess he had no qualms.

944
01:02:26,130 --> 01:02:29,780
Then you can get out there
and eliminate Byung Ho.

945
01:02:30,830 --> 01:02:33,810
I'll eliminate him for you.
If nothing else, I'll go and avenge you.

946

[Both of them going after their enemy,
traitor Giraffe first.]

950

Jong Kook, don't get me.
I just got here.

951
01:03:15,590 --> 01:03:17,090
I just got here!

952
01:03:17,090 --> 01:03:20,910
[At this rate, forget Tae Yeon's revenge...]

953
01:03:20,910 --> 01:03:24,020
Jong Kook...
let me face off with Jae Suk once.

954
01:03:24,020 --> 01:03:25,790
- What?
- Just once...

955
01:03:25,790 --> 01:03:27,180
Jong Kook...

956
01:03:27,620 --> 01:03:28,840
He's already caught?

957
01:03:28,840 --> 01:03:31,120
- There's no need for him to try then.
- Jong Kook caught him?

958

[Giraffe's lifespan... there's not much left.]

959
01:03:37,690 --> 01:03:40,370
- They're following him.
- Kwang Soo is over then.

960

- Jong Kook and...
- Tae Yeon's been ousted...

961

- Tae Yeon's been ousted.
- Tae Yeon's been ousted?

962
01:03:45,970 --> 01:03:48,680
Yes, Son Byung Ho got her.
I told her that I'd avenge her.

963
01:03:48,680 --> 01:03:51,320
Jong Kook, you know you can
eliminate me at any time.

964
01:03:51,320 --> 01:03:53,270
Just let me avenge Tae Yeon first.

965
01:03:54,140 --> 01:03:55,270
Really?

966
01:03:55,270 --> 01:03:56,700
What kind of revenge?

967
01:03:58,630 --> 01:04:03,790
[Worth using until he can eliminate
Byung Ho?]

968
01:04:03,790 --> 01:04:06,030
- You promised, okay?
- Yes, Jong Kook. Just until I get him.

969
01:04:06,030 --> 01:04:07,830
- Go eliminate him then.
- I'll be on my way then.

970
01:04:10,840 --> 01:04:14,680
[Whew... I survived... for now.]

Byung Ho to Kwang Soo.]

- That's not what I meant!

- Gary!

after hearing all the noise.]

Kwang Soo, rip his name off!

980
01:04:55,730 --> 01:04:57,330
Kwang Soo, you have to think
carefully about this!

981

[Yoo-ruce Willis undoubtedly
heads over this way too!]

982

- Yes.

01:05:33,820 --> 01:05:37,760
[If he had lasted 10 more minutes,
they could've met up.]

- Let's go get Byung Ho.

991
01:05:47,560 --> 01:05:49,730
[Next target is Byung Ho before
Ji Hyo makes her entrance.]

992
01:05:49,730 --> 01:05:50,900
- Hurry up and find Byung Ho.
- Yes, I will.

993
01:05:55,860 --> 01:05:58,680
[Until Ji Hyo gets here...]

994
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:04,040
[Where is he? Byung Ho...]

995
01:06:06,350 --> 01:06:08,440
- Good luck, Ji Hyo.
- Ji Hyo, fighting!

996
01:06:08,440 --> 01:06:11,270
- Fighting!
- Wow, there's a team with both members now?

997
01:06:11,270 --> 01:06:14,190
[Purple team is the only team with both
Byung Ho and Ji Hyo still alive.]

998
01:06:14,190 --> 01:06:19,230
<i>[Number 11, Song Ji Hyo's entrance.
Number 11, Song Ji Hyo's entrance.]</i>

999
01:06:20,120 --> 01:06:23,870
[Ace Ji Hyo needs to quickly
meet with her teammate, Byung Ho...]

1000
01:06:23,870 --> 01:06:28,830
<i>Number 11, Song Ji Hyo's entrance.
Number 11, Song Ji Hyo's entrance.</i>

1001
01:06:34,990 --> 01:06:37,160
I want to eliminate Jong Kook,
but I can't think of a way.

1002
01:06:38,370 --> 01:06:42,900
[His plot to betray making its' appearance.]

1003
01:06:44,520 --> 01:06:46,830
<i>I should've just ripped it off then,
but I got caught.</i>

1004
01:06:47,900 --> 01:06:52,330
[The tiger can hear everything you say...]

1005
01:06:52,330 --> 01:06:54,770
[Tiger having heard the traitorous Giraffe
talking to himself...]

1006
01:06:55,570 --> 01:06:58,760
[Awfully unlucky traitorous Giraffe.]

1007
01:07:00,510 --> 01:07:05,720
[You scoundrel... you won't be forgiven!]

1008
01:07:05,720 --> 01:07:07,700
<i>- Kwang Soo, I shouldn't have let you live.
- No, no!</i>

1009
01:07:07,700 --> 01:07:08,830
<i>Kim Jong Kook, let's fight!</i>

1010
01:07:08,830 --> 01:07:11,260
<i>Please eliminate Kim Jong Kook!</i>

1011
01:07:11,260 --> 01:07:12,670
[All this time, I've let him live and live...]

1012
01:07:12,670 --> 01:07:14,970
[I let you live, and you betray me.
I let you go, and you betray me.]

1013
01:07:14,980 --> 01:07:16,040
[I make an alliance with you,
and you betray me.]

1014
01:07:16,040 --> 01:07:20,350
[I be nice to you, and you betray me...]

1015
01:07:25,910 --> 01:07:32,450
[Because of you, all the kids thinks that
Giraffes are traitorous animals lately.]

1016
01:07:33,390 --> 01:07:38,910
[That's why today...
it's your turn to be had!]

1017
01:07:47,170 --> 01:07:49,760
[Tiger succeeds in hunting down
the Giraffe!]

1018
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:52,200
[Kwang Soo - Out!]

1019
01:07:52,980 --> 01:07:56,420
[The result of betraying is
an even bigger betrayal - Running Man]

1020
01:08:05,420 --> 01:08:06,820
- Is Kwang Soo ousted?
- Huh?

1021
01:08:06,820 --> 01:08:09,360
Is Kwang Soo ousted?
Did you eliminate him?

1022
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:18,390
Since Jung Geun is still alive too,
let's start after we oust one more person.

1023
01:08:18,390 --> 01:08:22,730
[Huh? Why are these two being
cordial all of a sudden?]

1024
01:08:31,270 --> 01:08:32,790
I'm just heading this way.

1025
01:08:33,950 --> 01:08:35,230
I'm just heading this way.

1026
01:08:35,660 --> 01:08:38,330
[Just passing by?]

1027
01:08:38,330 --> 01:08:41,110
- Wait... that was a little strange.
- I'm just heading this way.

1028
01:08:41,110 --> 01:08:42,700
Don't misunderstand.
I'm just heading this way.

1029
01:08:43,530 --> 01:08:45,340
That was really strange.

1030
01:08:45,340 --> 01:08:46,960
Wasn't that really weird?

1031
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:49,200
Hey! Don't misunderstand what
I was doing.

1032
01:08:49,200 --> 01:08:50,610
[His ambush has been thwarted for now.]

1033
01:08:53,860 --> 01:08:55,750
I have to oust Kim Jong Kook...

1034
01:08:58,320 --> 01:09:02,900
[Pretending to be in alliance...
but both eyeing for a chance.]

1035
01:09:07,060 --> 01:09:09,760
[Catching each other in the act.]

1036
01:09:09,760 --> 01:09:12,230
- I thought you were heading that way?
- Why did you turn around?

1037
01:09:12,230 --> 01:09:14,620
[Both arguing that they were
each heading in that direction.]

1038
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:18,930
What? Jae Suk...

1039
01:09:21,430 --> 01:09:22,930
I'm just jogging.

1040
01:09:24,670 --> 01:09:29,340
[At some time, they're going to have to
start hunting one another down...]

1041
01:09:38,160 --> 01:09:42,080
[The two circling around each other...
just who will get the last laugh?]

1042
01:09:43,660 --> 01:09:45,270
Just somebody win.

1043
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:48,150
That's right, I still have Jung Geun!

1044
01:09:49,030 --> 01:09:51,550
Shin Jung Geun!

1045
01:09:51,550 --> 01:09:54,620
- I'll be back.
- Fighting!

1046
01:09:55,290 --> 01:09:57,720
- Gary, I'll be back.
- Yes, Jong Won. Fighting!

1047
01:09:59,710 --> 01:10:06,940
[At last, the entrance of the final player.
White Team's Lee Jong Won's entrance!]

1048
01:10:06,940 --> 01:10:12,270
[Will he be the one to start the final battle
that everyone is circling around?]

1049
01:10:16,220 --> 01:10:19,470
[Traitorous Giraffe lonely walking.]

1050
01:10:22,620 --> 01:10:25,050
[Returning right away without
having done anything.]

1051
01:10:25,570 --> 01:10:28,690
Pil! Chok... Soo!

1052
01:10:28,690 --> 01:10:30,310
What happened?

1053
01:10:31,450 --> 01:10:34,450
<i>You're much better at returning
than when you were heading out.</i>

1054
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:37,560
Why did you come back so quickly?

1055
01:10:37,560 --> 01:10:39,950
- Who eliminated you?
- Kim Jong Kook!

1056
01:10:41,150 --> 01:10:44,030
- That was the first time being stabbed...
- Kim Jong Kook, fighting!

1057
01:10:44,030 --> 01:10:46,210
You did good, Kim Jong Kook!

1058
01:10:47,240 --> 01:10:49,060
You came back way too quickly...

1059
01:10:49,060 --> 01:10:51,680
[Orange team, Tae Yeon and Kwang Soo
first to be out of the game.]

1060
01:10:51,680 --> 01:10:57,320
Chang Suk feels better now after
being given Tae Yeon's name tag.

1061
01:10:59,260 --> 01:11:03,130
- Does anyone have a pen?
- Tae Yeon is better than gold.

1062
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:06,390
I'm going to get her to autograph it too!

1063
01:11:07,490 --> 01:11:10,070
- My daughter's name is Yae Won.
- Yae Won?

1064
01:11:10,300 --> 01:11:16,170
[Chang Suk is also whipped by his daughter
asking Tae Yeon for her autograph.]

1065
01:11:25,330 --> 01:11:27,240
<i>Are you that happy even though
you're dead?</i>

1066
01:11:28,260 --> 01:11:31,050
- Why are you so happy?
- Tae Yeon over the gold.

1067
01:11:34,270 --> 01:11:39,070
Everyone... come join us in jail!

1068
01:11:41,660 --> 01:11:43,240
Byung Ho!

1069
01:11:45,700 --> 01:11:47,470
Byung Ho, where are you?

1070
01:11:47,470 --> 01:11:50,640
Staying alive for me like this...

1071
01:11:58,080 --> 01:11:59,340
Ji Hyo!

1072
01:12:01,510 --> 01:12:04,650
[Finally!]

1073
01:12:04,650 --> 01:12:07,460
[Purple team's Byung Ho and Ji Hyo unite!]

1074
01:12:07,460 --> 01:12:09,590
- You remained alive!
- I did remain alive.

1075
01:12:09,590 --> 01:12:15,230
- When Tae Yeon attacked me earlier...
- That was seriously no joke!

1076
01:12:15,230 --> 01:12:17,480
- I did good, right?
- You seriously did great!

1077
01:12:17,480 --> 01:12:21,470
- We're the only ones left alive right now.
- Our team's the only one remaining, right?

1078
01:12:22,090 --> 01:12:25,660
- We are the only ones right now...
- I think I saw Jung Geun.

1079
01:12:26,250 --> 01:12:31,870
[Will they be able to take the win?]

1080
01:12:33,560 --> 01:12:34,660
Come this way.

1081
01:12:34,660 --> 01:12:37,200
- Lee Jong Won is heading this way.
- I know.

1082
01:12:39,190 --> 01:12:43,370
[Even though he's alone,
capable Jong Won is heading this way...]

1083
01:12:48,550 --> 01:12:52,310
[And now even though strength is strength,
a strategic fight is more important!]

1084
01:12:52,310 --> 01:12:53,840
I bet Jong Kook is over there.

1085
01:12:56,100 --> 01:12:58,180
- Hello. I came to say hi.
- Oh, really?

1086
01:12:58,180 --> 01:12:59,860
Have a nice jog.

1087
01:12:59,860 --> 01:13:01,220
[Checking out each other's resolve for now.]

1088
01:13:03,320 --> 01:13:04,440
I have to get them.

1089
01:13:05,010 --> 01:13:09,220
[Jung Geun planning on ridding
the Purple team's two members.]

1090
01:13:09,220 --> 01:13:11,290
We have to eliminate one of them, Jong Won.

1091
01:13:11,800 --> 01:13:14,130
- We should eliminate one of them.
- Should we form an alliance?

1092
01:13:14,130 --> 01:13:15,480
Just one of them...

1093
01:13:15,490 --> 01:13:19,970
Just because you guys are alone...
I'm going to get you instead though.

1094
01:13:22,980 --> 01:13:25,070
Hey, hey...

1095
01:13:25,080 --> 01:13:26,950
Why are you coming in my direction?

1096
01:13:26,950 --> 01:13:30,020
[The moment any one of them leaves their
guard down, they're headed to jail!]

1097
01:13:30,660 --> 01:13:33,220
- One of the guests has to remain alive.
- I know.

1098
01:13:33,850 --> 01:13:36,710
- Right now, I...
- Let's send Ji Hyo away.

1099
01:13:36,710 --> 01:13:39,480
[Alliance formed. Start the attack!]

1100
01:13:39,480 --> 01:13:41,280
I'm sorry.

1101
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:47,650
She's quick!

1102
01:13:49,470 --> 01:13:51,460
Come on, don't...

1103
01:13:53,440 --> 01:13:56,890
[Purple team's Byung Ho in danger!]

1104
01:13:56,890 --> 01:13:58,640
You almost had him!

1105
01:13:59,400 --> 01:14:00,510
Be careful, Ji Hyo.

1106
01:14:00,510 --> 01:14:02,950
This seriously isn't the time
to be attacking us!

1107
01:14:02,950 --> 01:14:06,080
Let's all survive for a while...
as guests...

1108
01:14:06,080 --> 01:14:08,950
[Another alliance...
for all the dad's to remain alive.]

1109
01:14:08,950 --> 01:14:11,310
- Let's all promise each other.
- This is for real.

1110
01:14:11,310 --> 01:14:17,260
[Including Ji Hyo...
All the guest daddy's to unite and align.]

1111
01:14:18,220 --> 01:14:19,500
Let's end them away one by one.

1112
01:14:20,840 --> 01:14:25,550
[Until Yoo-ruce Willis and Mr. Capable are
eliminated, not to touch one another.]

1113
01:14:27,260 --> 01:14:30,870
[This is big trouble...
how do I beat all four?]

1114
01:14:30,870 --> 01:14:32,680
- Jae Suk... Jae Suk.
- What?

1115
01:14:32,680 --> 01:14:35,870
[The middle-aged man passing by again.]

1116
01:14:35,880 --> 01:14:38,000
What's wrong with you?
You're so sensitive today.

1117
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:42,250
[Arguing again... even in the midst of danger,
here they are at it again.]

1118
01:14:42,260 --> 01:14:44,380
- Hurry up and leave.
- I'm seeing where I can go.

1119
01:14:46,660 --> 01:14:48,940
- Are going to be like this?
- Come on...

1120
01:14:48,940 --> 01:14:54,160
[They need to join their forces if they're
to go up against the four dads.]

1121
01:14:59,750 --> 01:15:02,780
[Okay... in that case!]

1122
01:15:08,130 --> 01:15:10,890
[Dad alliance discovers
Mr. Capable's location!]

1123
01:15:10,890 --> 01:15:14,540
[Agreeing that Mr. Capable
should be their first target.]

1124
01:15:14,960 --> 01:15:16,600
<i>Jong Kook, come here. Let's do this.</i>

1125
01:15:18,820 --> 01:15:21,400
[Yoo-ruce Willis joining in
from the opposite side.]

1126
01:15:21,400 --> 01:15:22,740
Jae Suk's here too.
We can do it all in one.

1127
01:15:23,130 --> 01:15:28,750
[Blue team's Jae Suk and
Green team's Jong Kook vs. Dad alliance.]

1128
01:15:28,750 --> 01:15:30,720
There they are. It's starting.

1129
01:15:31,660 --> 01:15:36,410
[This is the moment of battle...]

1130
01:15:36,410 --> 01:15:41,430
[No matter who gets ousted,
a big change is about to come...]

1131
01:15:42,670 --> 01:15:45,870
- They're all there. They're going at it.
- This is really entertaining.

1132
01:15:49,810 --> 01:15:52,940
[Mr. Capable attacks Jong Won first!]

1133
01:15:53,450 --> 01:15:57,170
[Yoo-ruce Willis and Mr. Capable on
the same team for once in a long time!]

1134
01:15:58,250 --> 01:16:00,690
[Jong Won starts his counterattack!]

1135
01:16:00,690 --> 01:16:02,850
[Jong Won vs. Jae Suk. A nice match!]

1136
01:16:04,460 --> 01:16:07,780
[If Yoo-ruce Willis gets pushed back,
it's the end for him!]

1137
01:16:12,280 --> 01:16:14,410
[Jong Kook!]

1138
01:16:14,410 --> 01:16:17,070
[Go away, Jung Geun!]

1139
01:16:18,660 --> 01:16:20,840
[Mr. Capable on his way!]

1140
01:16:23,540 --> 01:16:25,480
[Jong Kook... come here!]

1141
01:16:30,310 --> 01:16:32,400
[Yoo-ruce Willis and Mr. Capable's
awesome sync!]

1142
01:16:35,010 --> 01:16:37,710
[Easily sidestepping Jung Geun's attack!]

1143
01:16:37,710 --> 01:16:41,600
[The two powerhouses of Running Man...
who knew they had such good teamwork?]

1144
01:17:00,360 --> 01:17:03,300
[This is Running Man style!]

1145
01:17:04,850 --> 01:17:07,340
[Jong Kook - Out!]

1146
01:17:07,340 --> 01:17:09,270
Jong Kook... I'm so sorry.

1147
01:17:10,350 --> 01:17:12,240
[At a loss for words...]

1148
01:17:13,070 --> 01:17:15,350
[Betrayed him... he betrayed Jong Kook!]

1149
01:17:15,350 --> 01:17:18,090
[This is the Running Man betrayal
they've all only heard about.]

1150
01:17:18,090 --> 01:17:20,280
I had a feeling!

1151
01:17:21,810 --> 01:17:24,260
The card that I was going to play myself...

1152
01:17:25,990 --> 01:17:27,500
It's Jong Kook! Jong Kook!

1153
01:17:27,500 --> 01:17:30,540
- Good! I'm glad!
- Jong Kook?

1154
01:17:30,540 --> 01:17:33,540
What a sight...
you need a taste of your own medicine!

1155
01:17:33,540 --> 01:17:37,180
[A full out celebration with the exception
of his teammate, Suk Jin.]

1156
01:17:38,630 --> 01:17:41,380
I was wondering how long
you were going to survive...

1157
01:17:41,380 --> 01:17:42,750
then you die right away!

1158
01:17:44,040 --> 01:17:45,320
You deserve it. You deserve it!

1159
01:17:45,910 --> 01:17:48,590
- It's sweeter than candy!
- Let's have a party tonight!

1160
01:17:51,610 --> 01:17:55,410
Kim Jong Kook... come join us in jail!

1161
01:17:59,470 --> 01:18:01,280
Let's all prepare a welcome dance.

1162
01:18:01,290 --> 01:18:03,730
[Holding an immediate dance party.]

1163
01:18:03,730 --> 01:18:04,880
One, two, three, four!

1164
01:18:10,970 --> 01:18:13,090
Two people! Two people!

1165
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,540
[Oh my goodness...]

1166
01:18:19,550 --> 01:18:20,690
[Falling over...]

1167
01:18:25,010 --> 01:18:29,180
[Ball of nerves after hugging Tae Yeon.]

1168
01:18:29,180 --> 01:18:32,590
- It was just a game! Why so nervous?
- Ha Ha! You said two people!

1169
01:18:32,590 --> 01:18:34,920
- What about it?
- I'm going to step out for a moment.

1170
01:18:34,920 --> 01:18:36,920
Ugh... that made me so nervous.

1171
01:18:40,490 --> 01:18:44,130
[Yoo-ruce Willis vs. Daddy alliance.]

1172
01:18:50,380 --> 01:18:52,780
What do I do about this?
It's four against one.

1173
01:18:52,780 --> 01:18:56,560
[After all the physical exertion,
at the point of exhaustion]

1174
01:18:56,560 --> 01:19:02,950
[On top of that, the heavy pressure of
a battle against tightly knit daddy alliance.]

1175
01:19:02,960 --> 01:19:04,750
No matter how,
I'm going to have to win this.

1176
01:19:06,500 --> 01:19:11,070
[The legend of Yoo-ruce Willis
that started two years ago on Chu-Suk.]

1177
01:19:11,070 --> 01:19:16,440
[His legendary skills that always
win against extreme conditions.]

1178
01:19:16,440 --> 01:19:20,540
[His amazing skills that have become
an icon in Running Man!]

1179
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:27,450
[Today...
Yoo-ruce Willis has been awakened again!]

1180
01:19:35,430 --> 01:19:36,490
Oh my God.

1181
01:19:37,570 --> 01:19:41,600
[The four members of Daddy alliance
that are searching through the area.]

1182
01:19:55,650 --> 01:19:57,140
[Ambush]

1183
01:19:57,140 --> 01:20:00,060
[He's not Yoo-ruce Willis
to be had so easily!]

1184
01:20:04,160 --> 01:20:06,310
Jae Suk's really fast...
I could've stopped him!

1185
01:20:06,310 --> 01:20:08,020
Where should we hide?

1186
01:20:23,620 --> 01:20:25,900
[It's blocked...]

1187
01:20:25,900 --> 01:20:27,440
So here's my thought.

1188
01:20:27,440 --> 01:20:33,130
Once Jae Suk's been eliminated,
only one of us has to remain alive.

1189
01:20:33,130 --> 01:20:37,000
Then we'll win. So either you
or I just need to stay alive.

1190
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:38,740
We need to eliminate Jae Suk
first though.

1191
01:20:43,950 --> 01:20:46,060
Is there a way to go or not?
There isn't?

1192
01:20:46,060 --> 01:20:48,050
I think he went down
from the opposite direction!

1193
01:20:48,050 --> 01:20:50,340
- He's not up there?
- He went down?

1194
01:20:50,340 --> 01:20:51,850
No, he came down.

1195
01:21:00,080 --> 01:21:02,580
Seriously... I seriously feel like death.

1196
01:21:05,290 --> 01:21:10,740
After eliminating Kim Jong Kook...
such a huge obstacle...

1197
01:21:11,200 --> 01:21:13,100
I had no idea there would be
such a huge obstacle like this.

1198
01:21:15,040 --> 01:21:19,100
[What to do... What do I do?]

1199
01:21:24,300 --> 01:21:26,670
- Jong Kook's here.
- Let's start the partying.

1200
01:21:26,670 --> 01:21:28,330
[The party is still going on in jail.]

1201
01:21:28,330 --> 01:21:29,740
Hey, he's my teammate.

1202
01:21:29,740 --> 01:21:31,500
[Only Suk Jin is not joining in
on the party.]

1203
01:21:33,710 --> 01:21:35,720
[Three times!]

1204
01:21:58,660 --> 01:22:00,840
[The party's guest of honor
makes his appearance.]

1205
01:22:00,840 --> 01:22:02,660
- Do you know what they're doing right now?
- What?

1206
01:22:10,540 --> 01:22:12,710
- Jong Kook... you know what they're doing?
- A little louder!

1207
01:22:12,710 --> 01:22:14,340
Are they celebrating my elimination?

1208
01:22:15,220 --> 01:22:16,910
- They are, aren't they?
- Yeah, they are.

1209
01:22:16,920 --> 01:22:19,870
This is your elimination party,
and he started it.

1210
01:22:19,870 --> 01:22:21,880
[Anyways, victory is a burst bubble
for the Green team as well.]

1211
01:22:23,370 --> 01:22:27,330
[Yoo-ruce Willis penetrating deep
into the battlefield once again.]

1212
01:22:33,100 --> 01:22:35,210
[Discovers Ji Hyo!]

1213
01:22:38,830 --> 01:22:40,240
Jae Suk's over here!

1214
01:22:40,510 --> 01:22:43,610
- Why of all places...
- Grab Jae Suk real quick!

1215
01:22:46,470 --> 01:22:47,780
I think they got him!

1216
01:22:49,960 --> 01:22:52,040
At least two of them have to be
ousted right now.

1217
01:22:52,040 --> 01:22:54,090
Nice... nice!
[Jae Suk!]

1218
01:22:55,650 --> 01:22:57,230
- He's right up front!
- Be careful!

1219
01:22:57,230 --> 01:23:00,670
[No matter where he goes,
enemies are all over the place!]

1220
01:23:00,670 --> 01:23:03,050
[Yoo-ruce Willis surrounded!]

1221
01:23:08,100 --> 01:23:11,570
[Just then! Jung Geun goes for
Byung Ho's name tag!]

1222
01:23:14,350 --> 01:23:17,300
[Daddy alliance's collapse?
Using the opportunity!]

1223
01:23:17,990 --> 01:23:21,160
[Shin Jung Geun - Out!]

1224
01:23:22,730 --> 01:23:28,520
[In an attempt at a revolt,
being ousted instead.]

1225
01:23:29,950 --> 01:23:31,210
What? What happened?

1226
01:23:31,210 --> 01:23:33,340
- He's caught... he got caught.
- He's caught.

1227
01:23:35,010 --> 01:23:36,680
He's eliminated.

1228
01:23:36,680 --> 01:23:38,230
Who? Who?

1229
01:23:39,860 --> 01:23:41,290
Jung Geun's been eliminated.

1230
01:23:41,290 --> 01:23:43,420
Jung Geun's the one eliminated.

1231
01:23:45,630 --> 01:23:48,420
[Yoo-ruce Willis vs.
Byung Ho, Jong Won and Ji Hyo.]

1232
01:23:48,420 --> 01:23:51,380
You're level of betrayal is too much.
I couldn't believe it.

1233
01:23:51,380 --> 01:23:53,770
- I have no choice if I want to survive.
- Okay, I got it.

1234
01:23:55,700 --> 01:23:58,070
[Jong Won heading up to get
Yoo-ruce Willis.]

1235
01:23:58,070 --> 01:23:59,840
- Why are you coming up here?
- Let's fight.

1236
01:24:00,760 --> 01:24:03,880
[Yoo-ruce Willis in extreme danger!]

1237
01:24:05,310 --> 01:24:10,520
[Just then! Jong Won going after Byung Ho!]

1238
01:24:12,660 --> 01:24:17,070
[Just then! Ji Hyo!]

1239
01:24:18,850 --> 01:24:21,640
[Song Ji Hyo - Out!]

1240
01:24:22,430 --> 01:24:25,850
[Daddy alliance is formally over!]

1241
01:24:25,850 --> 01:24:31,820
[Now the real battle... just who
will be the last one left standing?]

1242
01:24:33,690 --> 01:24:35,820
Jung Geun!

1243
01:24:36,380 --> 01:24:38,190
[Point of exhaustion.]

1244
01:24:38,190 --> 01:24:40,390
- You did great...
- What a loss...

1245
01:24:41,070 --> 01:24:44,270
- I didn't even get to betray anyone.
- Did you take a shower?

1246
01:24:44,280 --> 01:24:45,870
Who were you trying to eliminate
when you got eliminated?

1247
01:24:45,870 --> 01:24:47,400
I think Byung Ho got me.

1248
01:24:47,400 --> 01:24:51,430
[So chaotic that he doesn't even know
who he was ousted by.]

1249
01:24:51,430 --> 01:24:54,150
- Byung Ho's on a rampage today.
- Jae Suk, Ji Hyo, Jong Won...

1250
01:24:54,150 --> 01:24:55,930
- Byung Ho.
- And Byung Ho. Four left.

1251
01:24:56,580 --> 01:24:59,010
- There she is!
- Ji Hyo's out.

1252
01:25:00,490 --> 01:25:03,010
Jung Geun...
don't you think you were too much?

1253
01:25:03,020 --> 01:25:04,740
- How could you have done that?
- Why?

1254
01:25:05,640 --> 01:25:07,310
I didn't eliminate you.

1255
01:25:07,310 --> 01:25:10,800
How could you have betrayed us like that
when we were in an alliance?

1256
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:14,000
- I can't believe...
- You did it! You betrayed her!

1257
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:15,990
- You betrayed her, right?
- It wasn't a betrayal...

1258
01:25:15,990 --> 01:25:18,990
[Being congratulated by
the experts in betrayal.]

1259
01:25:27,660 --> 01:25:29,810
Jung Geun,
congratulations on your first betrayal!

1260
01:25:29,810 --> 01:25:31,710
- First betrayal...
- I didn't betray...

1261
01:25:31,720 --> 01:25:33,800
[The excitement of first betrayal.]

1262
01:25:33,800 --> 01:25:35,640
If you come on Running Man,
you learn how to betray.

1263
01:25:36,490 --> 01:25:38,970
- What's that sound?
- What's going on?

1264
01:25:39,420 --> 01:25:41,870
- They're going at it! They're at it!
- Are they going at it?

1265
01:25:41,880 --> 01:25:43,310
Look! they're going at it!

1266
01:25:43,310 --> 01:25:47,860
[The three parties going around in a frenzy!]

1267
01:25:48,570 --> 01:25:52,460
[The last man standing out of the three
will be the ultimate winner today!]

1268
01:25:56,400 --> 01:25:58,670
[Simultaneously?]

1269
01:26:01,500 --> 01:26:04,770
[Yoo-ruce Willis rips off
Jong Won's name tag first!]

1270
01:26:04,780 --> 01:26:06,280
<i>Jae Suk ripped his off first.</i>

1271
01:26:07,320 --> 01:26:09,000
Jae Suk did it first, Jae Suk.

1272
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:10,960
Jae Suk ripped it off first.

1273
01:26:10,960 --> 01:26:14,190
So Jong Won is out?
Wow... this program is entertaining!

1274
01:26:15,130 --> 01:26:18,330
This is unbelievable!
It keeps switching over.

1275
01:26:18,330 --> 01:26:20,770
This is the new weekend program.
The CCTV program.

1276
01:26:20,770 --> 01:26:22,360
[The new weekend variety, CCTV!]

1277
01:26:22,680 --> 01:26:27,810
[The motivation of the guests driven
by the need as a father...]

1278
01:26:27,810 --> 01:26:29,960
- That's why at home...
- There he is!

1279
01:26:31,270 --> 01:26:35,010
[White team's annihilation.]

1280
01:26:37,210 --> 01:26:38,760
There they go.
They're going up against each other.

1281
01:26:48,450 --> 01:26:55,510
[The face-off... has come this far.]

1282
01:26:59,270 --> 01:27:02,430
[The two that were on the same
team as of last week.]

1283
01:27:02,430 --> 01:27:06,480
[Yoo-ruce Willis vs. Son Byung Ho]

1284
01:27:06,480 --> 01:27:10,850
[No matter who wins,
they've both given their best.]

1285
01:27:10,850 --> 01:27:13,050
- I bet she'll be very happy.
- You understand, right?

1286
01:27:13,810 --> 01:27:15,340
It's all thanks to you. Thanks.

1287
01:27:16,030 --> 01:27:18,830
[But the final glory...]

1288
01:27:18,830 --> 01:27:21,520
[Can only belong to one person!]

1289
01:27:34,810 --> 01:27:40,170
[An unforgiving battle between men.]

1290
01:27:40,170 --> 01:27:41,490
This is scary.

1291
01:27:41,490 --> 01:27:43,160
Fighting!

1292
01:27:43,160 --> 01:27:48,190
[Nerve-wrecking jail viewing room.]

1293
01:27:52,760 --> 01:27:54,800
No, they just tugged at it.

1294
01:27:57,810 --> 01:27:59,930
I'm so sweaty and slippery...

1295
01:28:01,560 --> 01:28:03,940
[Fine...]

1296
01:28:03,940 --> 01:28:07,520
[My final attack!]

1297
01:28:26,900 --> 01:28:32,700
[The screen and audio that went blank
at the sound of ripping.]

1298
01:28:34,490 --> 01:28:37,310
If Jae Suk's to win, I even have this too...

1299
01:28:37,310 --> 01:28:40,190
[Getting Tae Yeon's signature and a win?]

1300
01:28:40,770 --> 01:28:42,410
There's no need to work so hard at it.

1301
01:28:43,990 --> 01:28:47,580
[Without knowing if he's won,
eating his cake first!]

1302
01:28:53,840 --> 01:28:55,740
Everyone, be good to your
daughters at home...

1303
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:04,160
[But just what happened at the end?]

1304
01:29:04,170 --> 01:29:06,010
- How did it end?
- What happened?

1305
01:29:06,020 --> 01:29:07,840
- Who won?
- Who won?

1306
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:11,200
[Just who is the ultimate winner?]

1307
01:29:11,200 --> 01:29:14,650
Die Hard... It was Yoo-ruce Willis II.

1308
01:29:14,650 --> 01:29:16,720
[It was Yoo-ruce Willis II?]

1309
01:29:16,720 --> 01:29:19,690
[In that case...]

1310
01:29:21,950 --> 01:29:24,790
[Jae Suk going in for his final attack
after making a firm determination.]

1311
01:29:24,790 --> 01:29:28,680
[Byung Ho had Jae Suk's name tag
in his grip too.]

1312
01:29:32,440 --> 01:29:36,270
[By a split second difference,
Jae Suk was first!]

1313
