Kwang Soo,
why don't you tell him more about it?

140
00:07:38,988 --> 00:07:40,456
You're better than I to tell him about
what that's like.

141
00:07:40,457 --> 00:07:42,036
I think you're going to be
eliminated early too.

- Yes.
- Why do you keep enforcing that?

00:08:34,015 --> 00:08:36,955
- Asking why we've introduced ourselves...
- Since you may not be seeing them again soon.

155

[Since they may be saying farewell
to one another within moments.]

156

Jin Hee and Chang Ui both are really
nervous about being eliminated right away.

<i>And as soon as you pick one,
you have to eat the cookie.</i>

167
00:09:14,281 --> 00:09:16,591
Everyone, take one.

168
00:09:16,592 --> 00:09:18,035
<i>We will start with Ji Sung.</i>

169
00:09:18,036 --> 00:09:22,170
You've never been in this situation before...
but first to be out can be very lonely.

170
00:09:22,171 --> 00:09:23,281
<i>Please show everyone.</i>

171
00:09:23,859 --> 00:09:25,423
<i>One, two, three!</i>

172
00:09:25,424 --> 00:09:28,548
- Number six... number six?
- No, it's number nine.

173
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:33,502
[And our exhausted Jin Hee?]
I think he's going to get a good number.

174
00:09:33,503 --> 00:09:35,176
Can I eat this?

175
00:09:35,177 --> 00:09:37,435
- You can eat it later.
- One, two, three!

176
00:09:37,436 --> 00:09:41,418
[Jin Hee picks number seven.]
Seven... the lucky number seven.

177
00:09:42,342 --> 00:09:45,798
[Chang Ui who came on the show today
with a firm resolve.]

178
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:48,891
[Number two...]

179
00:09:48,892 --> 00:09:51,156
Chang Ui, I knew it...

180
00:09:52,564 --> 00:09:56,204
One, two, three! Number four!
[Kwang Soo, number four.]

181
00:09:56,204 --> 00:09:58,230
[A little ominous?]

182
00:09:58,231 --> 00:10:03,168
One, two, three! Number three!
[Jong Kook, number three.]

183
00:10:04,786 --> 00:10:07,003
[Safe number? Ji Hyo, eight.]

184
00:10:07,004 --> 00:10:09,406
[Number one hasn't made an
appearance yet.]

185
00:10:09,407 --> 00:10:11,277
[Suk Jin, number five.]

186
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:14,298
- One, two, three!
- Number six!

187
00:10:14,299 --> 00:10:17,319
[Ha Ha, number six. Which means...]
Number one is still left!

188
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:20,240
[The only ones left are number one
and ten.]

189
00:10:20,241 --> 00:10:23,686
- One, two, three!
- Number one!

190
00:10:23,687 --> 00:10:26,055
[Gary, number one.]

191
00:10:27,849 --> 00:10:30,523
It's number one?
Why did I get number one?

192
00:10:34,434 --> 00:10:37,141
[Ah... I'm number one.]

193
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:41,359
-How did Gary pick number one?
- How did Gary number one?

194
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,531
- Gary...
- Read it out loud.

195
00:10:44,532 --> 00:10:48,485
<i>[If you flip the coin on top of the book by
hitting it with your hand, you pass!]</i>

196
00:10:48,486 --> 00:10:50,280
<i>[If you don't flip it,
you're immediately eliminated.]</i>

197
00:10:50,281 --> 00:10:53,164
[Hitting the book means...]

198
00:10:54,104 --> 00:10:57,077
[A game where you have to hit
the book to flip the coin over.]

199
00:10:57,978 --> 00:10:59,902
If number one is eliminated,
then the rest of us get to go on?

200
00:10:59,903 --> 00:11:03,024
[By going in order, as soon as someone is
eliminated, the rest gets to go on.]

201
00:11:08,151 --> 00:11:10,435
Numbers one through four are in danger.

202
00:11:10,436 --> 00:11:13,701
[Jin Hee who's commented he's not feeling
competitive today is reacting strongly.]

203
00:11:14,752 --> 00:11:18,785
[I'm number seven. So happy...]

204
00:11:23,923 --> 00:11:28,319
Number ten... number ten...
Days like this can happen to me too.

205
00:11:29,183 --> 00:11:30,980
We're going to go out and
get some fresh air.

206
00:11:32,315 --> 00:11:34,115
If you hit it too hard,
it can flip over twice.

207
00:11:37,551 --> 00:11:43,424
We don't have much time left...
so if he's eliminated, get back on the train.

208
00:11:43,425 --> 00:11:46,153
Don't follow the rest of us
back into the train and just go.

209
00:11:46,154 --> 00:11:49,436
Let's all be cool and
say our goodbyes then.

210
00:11:50,349 --> 00:11:54,601
[The first destination, Samrae Station.]

211
00:11:56,647 --> 00:11:59,625
[Number one, Gary, full of nervousness.]

212
00:12:00,963 --> 00:12:03,379
No, it's okay Gary. It won't happen.
If he's eliminated, he's left behind alone?

213
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:04,805
- Yes, he's left alone.
- Then you'll just have to flip it over.

214
00:12:04,806 --> 00:12:06,395
It's so lonely to be left behind alone.

215
00:12:08,662 --> 00:12:11,883
He'd need some knitting or
cross-stitching stuff.

216
00:12:13,073 --> 00:12:14,515
He'll have a lot of time on his hands.

217
00:12:19,751 --> 00:12:23,468
[The mission table coming into view.]

218
00:12:24,784 --> 00:12:28,264
[Exactly one minute during the stop.]

219
00:12:28,715 --> 00:12:29,999
Quickly!

220
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:36,162
[Starting with number one, Gary.]

221
00:12:36,657 --> 00:12:37,843
Here I go!

222
00:12:44,369 --> 00:12:48,046
[Just one chance! Will the coin flip over?]

223
00:12:48,953 --> 00:12:50,835
[Nervous number two, Chang Ui]

224
00:12:53,966 --> 00:12:56,095
[It flipped over!]

225
00:12:56,096 --> 00:12:58,421
[Number one, Gary, succeeds!]

226
00:12:58,422 --> 00:13:01,119
[The chance goes over to
number two, Chang Ui!]

227
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,290
One, two, three!

228
00:13:08,161 --> 00:13:11,629
[Fail...]

229
00:13:13,349 --> 00:13:16,931
[Flipping over twice
and landing on the same side.]

230
00:13:28,867 --> 00:13:31,502
[The guest car full of cheer.]

231
00:13:32,055 --> 00:13:34,603
- Gary... you did great.
- I did it... I did it!

232
00:13:34,604 --> 00:13:36,202
[Unpredictable Gary who shows
how capable he can be at times.]

233
00:13:37,615 --> 00:13:40,681
Didn't I tell you? Chang Ui...

234
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:48,083
[It's been so long since
he's been on the show...]

235
00:13:48,084 --> 00:13:50,124
This is unbelievable... unbelievable.

236
00:13:50,125 --> 00:13:53,171
Let's just say our farewells to him now.

237
00:13:53,172 --> 00:13:55,904
- Just wave bye.
- Say bye to him.

238
00:13:58,811 --> 00:14:02,472
See? These kind of premonitions that
I have are never wrong...

239
00:14:03,562 --> 00:14:07,469
[Chang Ui's elimination they
were all nervous about...]

240
00:14:09,277 --> 00:14:14,313
[Could Jong Kook's premonition
have been right on target?]

241
00:14:14,314 --> 00:14:20,700
[Wait... but Big nosed Brother said that
the coin could flip over twice...]

242
00:14:20,701 --> 00:14:23,727
[The future he predicted for himself?]

243
00:14:24,855 --> 00:14:27,423
[Darn...]

244
00:14:27,424 --> 00:14:29,483
Have a nice trip.

245
00:14:33,821 --> 00:14:36,533
[And so, Chang Ui's eliminated.]

246
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:45,928
Why did it have to flip over twice?
I had a bad feeling about it from the start.

247
00:14:45,929 --> 00:14:48,922
[Bad premonition from the beginning.]

248
00:14:48,923 --> 00:14:53,406
Things keep going the way the guys are
saying. It's almost like magic.

249
00:14:53,795 --> 00:15:00,225
[Does being on the train really allow them to
gain the ability to see into the future?]

250
00:15:00,226 --> 00:15:03,602
[Unbelievable number one, Gary]

251
00:15:03,603 --> 00:15:04,877
The two of you are really cold-hearted.

252
00:15:04,878 --> 00:15:09,712
[The two members of 'The Great Seer' who
appeared happiest with Chang Ui's elimination.]

253
00:15:12,365 --> 00:15:15,593
- But they all came on the show together...
- Are you seriously sleepy?

254
00:15:15,594 --> 00:15:17,364
I'm sleepy... I'm seriously sleepy.

255
00:15:17,365 --> 00:15:19,873
There used to be a head here,
and now it's gone.

256
00:15:19,874 --> 00:15:21,686
Chang Ui used to be in this seat.

257
00:15:21,687 --> 00:15:26,156
I think Chang Ui has all the looks when
it comes to someone being eliminated.

258
00:15:26,157 --> 00:15:29,104
If you look at his face,
he has very sad looking eyes.

259
00:15:29,105 --> 00:15:31,985
- His eyes are very sad.
- As if he was up crying all night.

260
00:15:33,381 --> 00:15:36,409
[Move over deer...
I'm the new doe-eyed kid in town...]

261
00:15:37,171 --> 00:15:38,688
I wonder what Chang Ui's doing?

262
00:15:43,798 --> 00:15:47,090
[Sad eyed Chang Ui is...]

263
00:15:48,401 --> 00:15:51,240
I seriously had no idea that I would
be the first one to be eliminated.

264
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:56,574
Because I wanted to win so badly,
I think just the opposite has happened.

265
00:15:57,324 --> 00:15:59,493
I hope they enjoy themselves...

266
00:16:02,773 --> 00:16:05,914
And I hope the other two survive.

267
00:16:07,682 --> 00:16:10,495
[Such a sad way of saying things...]

268
00:16:12,379 --> 00:16:15,835
- Chang Ui...
- Did you see how he did it?

269
00:16:16,766 --> 00:16:19,160
The number has a lot to do with it...

270
00:16:19,161 --> 00:16:22,632
<i>Jeonjoo Station is the next stop to
determine who'll be eliminated next.</i>

271
00:16:22,633 --> 00:16:26,765
- You have two minutes at the stop.
- The person to be left is... this person?

272
00:16:26,766 --> 00:16:28,622
Why are you saying that it's me?

273
00:16:31,443 --> 00:16:34,229
- This person!
- The person who sees into the future!

274
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:38,581
<i>As we did the last time, we'll
determine the order with a walnut cookie.</i>

275
00:16:40,927 --> 00:16:44,526
[More nervous energy than the
last time.]

276
00:16:44,527 --> 00:16:47,067
[Starting with Gary this time around.]

277
00:16:47,068 --> 00:16:49,031
One, two, three!

278
00:16:49,032 --> 00:16:51,165
[Whew... Gary picks number five.]

279
00:16:53,653 --> 00:16:55,199
One, two, three!

280
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:59,105
[Wow! Number nine!]

281
00:17:00,105 --> 00:17:02,348
[Overtly happy about his pick?]

282
00:17:02,349 --> 00:17:05,041
- One, two, three!
- Number one!

283
00:17:05,423 --> 00:17:07,719
Number three...
[Kwang Soo, number three]

284
00:17:08,339 --> 00:17:11,610
- Number three can be nerve wrecking.
- No one's picked number one yet.

285
00:17:11,611 --> 00:17:14,407
Number one hasn't been picked yet.
Please... number one...

286
00:17:16,172 --> 00:17:19,133
[There it is! Number one.]

287
00:17:19,897 --> 00:17:23,718
[Big nosed brother, number one.]

288
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:28,519
Jeonjoo station... this person!

289
00:17:29,945 --> 00:17:31,189
Ji Hyo?

290
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:32,651
One, two, three!

291
00:17:32,652 --> 00:17:35,232
Number four!
[Ji Hyo, number four]

292
00:17:35,233 --> 00:17:37,025
One, two, three!

293
00:17:37,026 --> 00:17:39,649
[Ha Ha, number six]

294
00:17:40,512 --> 00:17:44,034
- Number seven!
- Number eight!

295
00:17:44,035 --> 00:17:47,803
[That means...
Jae Suk has number two!]

296
00:17:50,455 --> 00:17:53,221
- I can't believe I got number one.
- This is making me nervous...

297
00:17:53,895 --> 00:17:56,391
<i>[Pick a ball and depending on what it says,
Board or Elimination]</i>

298
00:17:56,392 --> 00:17:59,721
- This is good!
- I'm good! This is okay then.

299
00:17:59,722 --> 00:18:02,199
- First ones to go is better.
- Going first is actually better.

300
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:05,323
This will be over by the fourth person.
By the fourth one, it'll be over.

301
00:18:06,591 --> 00:18:08,833
If Suk Jin picks the elimination ball,
then the rest of us are safe?

302
00:18:08,834 --> 00:18:11,881
[Whomever picks the elimination ball first
is eliminated and the rest are safe.]

303
00:18:14,852 --> 00:18:17,935
[Second stop - Jeonjoo Station]

304
00:18:22,853 --> 00:18:24,171
I know we're getting ready to get off...

305
00:18:24,172 --> 00:18:26,971
but the three people standing up here are
the three who always lose at this.

306
00:18:28,141 --> 00:18:30,008
It's going to be over right now.

307
00:18:30,009 --> 00:18:31,474
[Full of nervous energy.]

308
00:18:36,519 --> 00:18:39,610
[Two minutes at the stop.]

309
00:18:42,286 --> 00:18:46,050
[Draw either a PASS, or ELIMINATED ball]

310
00:18:46,051 --> 00:18:47,863
Please... please!

311
00:18:49,143 --> 00:18:50,990
[Desperately wishing for the
elimination ball.]

312
00:18:52,204 --> 00:18:53,417
One, two, three!

313
00:18:55,236 --> 00:18:57,825
[Eliminated...]

314
00:18:57,826 --> 00:19:00,081
[Chosen - Eliminated]

315
00:19:04,137 --> 00:19:08,365
[Survivors disappearing
like a bolt of thunder.]

316
00:19:11,117 --> 00:19:13,140
Awesome... that was awesome.

317
00:19:18,995 --> 00:19:21,357
This is so unbelievable...

318
00:19:21,358 --> 00:19:24,349
[Guest car overflowing with cheer.]

319
00:19:25,175 --> 00:19:26,220
Perfect... that was perfect.

320
00:19:26,933 --> 00:19:31,020
[Number two, Jae Suk,
gains 10 years to his life.]

321
00:19:31,021 --> 00:19:32,793
He got eliminated before me.

322
00:19:32,794 --> 00:19:35,285
Wow... how could this...

323
00:19:37,447 --> 00:19:40,883
But... remember how I pointed to him
and said, 'This person' earlier?

324
00:19:42,088 --> 00:19:44,365
Jae Suk,
be careful with that hand of yours.

325
00:19:46,543 --> 00:19:48,833
Don't be rash and point that at anyone.

326
00:19:48,834 --> 00:19:51,116
What are you writing?

327
00:19:52,772 --> 00:19:56,568
Wow, Jin Hee is really hateful...
[Being hateful and writing 'Bye']

328
00:19:57,329 --> 00:19:59,872
You really are hateful... seriously...
Bye?

329
00:20:00,763 --> 00:20:02,293
He wrote, 'bye'.
That's what he wrote.

330
00:20:02,294 --> 00:20:06,606
But isn't he really exciting when someone
gets eliminated early on?

331
00:20:07,259 --> 00:20:10,142
Without even knowing...

332
00:20:10,143 --> 00:20:13,345
When I think about it from Suk Jin's shoes,
I shouldn't be getting this excited...

333
00:20:13,346 --> 00:20:14,531
But I can't help but be happy about it.

334
00:20:14,532 --> 00:20:17,991
He's already forgotten us and isn't
even saying bye to us as we're leaving.

335
00:20:17,992 --> 00:20:20,063
He's in his own little world.

336
00:20:21,653 --> 00:20:24,646
[The second person to be eliminated,
Ji Suk Jin.]

337
00:20:24,647 --> 00:20:26,949
Seriously...
how does this make any sense?

338
00:20:28,531 --> 00:20:30,277
This is seriously making me nervous now.

339
00:20:30,278 --> 00:20:32,503
[Eight people remaining out of
the original ten.]

340
00:20:35,285 --> 00:20:37,458
[Giraffe still remains alive.]

341
00:20:37,459 --> 00:20:40,530
Everyone that's likely to be eliminated
is being eliminated right now.

342
00:20:40,531 --> 00:20:42,836
That means that it's going along
as predicted.

343
00:20:43,956 --> 00:20:46,542
[Time to pick the order for the
next round.]

344
00:20:46,543 --> 00:20:48,994
- Let's all do this!
- Jae Suk.

345
00:20:51,138 --> 00:20:52,296
One, two, three!

346
00:20:52,297 --> 00:20:56,098
[Jae Suk, picks number two again!]

347
00:20:58,963 --> 00:21:01,595
One, two, three!

348
00:21:02,216 --> 00:21:05,361
[Oh... Giraffe, number six.]

349
00:21:06,252 --> 00:21:07,401
I'm set!

350
00:21:09,053 --> 00:21:10,558
One, two, three!

351
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:13,095
[Ji Hyo, number five.]

352
00:21:14,142 --> 00:21:16,475
- Ji Hyo picks really good numbers.
- One, two, three!

353
00:21:16,476 --> 00:21:19,155
[Gary, number eight.]

354
00:21:19,156 --> 00:21:20,868
Why isn't number one coming out yet?

355
00:21:20,869 --> 00:21:22,302
One, two, three!

356
00:21:22,995 --> 00:21:25,467
[Ha Ha, number seven.]

357
00:21:25,468 --> 00:21:27,344
I thought I was going to get
number one.

358
00:21:27,345 --> 00:21:29,083
Is he going to get number one?

359
00:21:30,055 --> 00:21:32,267
[Jin Hee, number three.]

360
00:21:35,343 --> 00:21:38,663
Number four!
[Ji Sung, number four. That means...]

361
00:21:38,664 --> 00:21:41,601
Jong Kook!
[Kkuk, number one.]

362
00:21:42,644 --> 00:21:45,691
[A celebration]

363
00:21:45,692 --> 00:21:47,623
It's okay, it's okay.
You won't be eliminated.

364
00:21:47,624 --> 00:21:49,521
<i>Here's your next mission.</i>

365
00:21:49,522 --> 00:21:51,292
[The next mission is...]

366
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:55,008
[Play 'Cham, cham, cham' with an expert.
Win, you pass. Lose, you're eliminated.]

367
00:21:55,009 --> 00:21:58,796
[Play a match of 'Cham, cham, cham' with
Dong Wan PD lying in wait at the next stop.]

368
00:21:58,797 --> 00:22:00,706
[If you lose, immediate elimination.]

369
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:04,257
I'm not good at that game...

370
00:22:06,029 --> 00:22:08,242
One, two, three. Cham, cham, cham!

371
00:22:11,548 --> 00:22:14,132
[Showing us the skills that he may be
eliminated right away.]

372
00:22:14,133 --> 00:22:15,920
Cham, cham, cham!

373
00:22:15,921 --> 00:22:18,533
[Jae Suk's no different.]

374
00:22:18,534 --> 00:22:20,354
[Number one and two full of
nervous energy.]

375
00:22:20,355 --> 00:22:22,310
[Putting number six at ease.]

376
00:22:22,311 --> 00:22:25,338
If Jong Kook passes,
it's all up in the air.

377
00:22:25,339 --> 00:22:30,309
If Jae Suk passes, then the rest...
Who's number three?

378
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:33,192
- It's Jin Hee, Jin Hee...
- No way...

379
00:22:33,193 --> 00:22:35,976
I would actually be really nice if
Jin Hee's eliminated during this round.

380
00:22:35,977 --> 00:22:39,966
- Number two... no way...
- Jin Hee, you should be eliminated.

381
00:22:46,952 --> 00:22:49,580
We're here! We're here!

382
00:22:53,344 --> 00:22:56,268
[Numbers one and two with their
nervous expressions.]

383
00:22:56,436 --> 00:22:57,937
I'll be back.

384
00:22:58,638 --> 00:23:01,088
As a guarantee that I'll be returning,
I'll leave my jacket here.

385
00:23:01,089 --> 00:23:03,520
[Leaving his jacket behind as a
guarantee that he'll return to the train?]

386
00:23:03,521 --> 00:23:05,214
I'll leave my jacket behind.

387
00:23:05,712 --> 00:23:07,487
The jacket won't come off.

388
00:23:15,458 --> 00:23:17,732
[Ultimately heading towards the exit
with the jacket still on.]

389
00:23:17,733 --> 00:23:20,020
Please... just this once.

390
00:23:20,021 --> 00:23:22,440
Please... please,
let Jong Kook be the one.

391
00:23:22,441 --> 00:23:25,153
[Everyone desperately wishing that
Jong Kook be the one to be eliminated.]

392
00:23:27,107 --> 00:23:32,797
[The third stop, Imsil Station]

393
00:23:35,304 --> 00:23:39,286
- I can't be eliminated here.
- I have to get the Ddak-Ji... I have to!

394
00:23:39,287 --> 00:23:41,856
- I have to get back on the train.
- Let's go, we've got one minute!

395
00:23:41,857 --> 00:23:43,896
[Time at the stop, one minute]

396
00:23:43,897 --> 00:23:46,659
To the left... it's to the left.

397
00:23:49,402 --> 00:23:52,252
[Cham, cham, cham-
In order starting with Jong Kook]

398
00:23:53,879 --> 00:23:55,273
Cham, cham, cham!

399
00:23:55,274 --> 00:23:57,631
[Jong Kook succeeds!]

400
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:00,565
Cham, cham, cham!

401
00:24:00,566 --> 00:24:02,866
[Jae Suk also succeeds?]

402
00:24:03,766 --> 00:24:04,888
Cham, cham, cham!

403
00:24:07,668 --> 00:24:11,537
[Ji Jin Hee fails...]

404
00:24:21,409 --> 00:24:23,116
Goodbye, Jin Hee!

405
00:24:24,025 --> 00:24:25,442
How could this have happened?

406
00:24:29,699 --> 00:24:34,438
[Numbers one and two
recovering within moments.]

407
00:24:37,946 --> 00:24:40,037
I had no idea that it would come
down to me.

408
00:24:42,305 --> 00:24:44,999
All the guests are getting the shaft today.

409
00:24:46,296 --> 00:24:49,300
[I can't believe I'm eliminated...]

410
00:24:49,301 --> 00:24:50,307
Cham, cham, cham...

411
00:24:50,308 --> 00:24:55,478
This way, that way... it should've been that.
How can you go this way twice?

412
00:24:57,510 --> 00:25:00,568
[The truth that he still can't accept...]

413
00:25:00,569 --> 00:25:01,892
Bye...

414
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:08,221
Sad... this is really sad.

415
00:25:11,475 --> 00:25:15,147
- He looks so sad all of a sudden.
- Yeah, he looks so down all of a sudden.

416
00:25:15,148 --> 00:25:16,381
His mood goes up and down a lot.

417
00:25:16,382 --> 00:25:18,195
Look at him. He looks really pissed off.

418
00:25:19,118 --> 00:25:20,823
[Seriously pissed off?]

419
00:25:21,728 --> 00:25:23,977
[I'm leaving...]

420
00:25:25,756 --> 00:25:28,392
- This is surprising.
- Thank goodness I'm not a guest.

421
00:25:29,827 --> 00:25:32,560
[You just wait...]

422
00:25:32,561 --> 00:25:35,026
It would be so nice if Jin Hee's eliminated.

423
00:25:35,027 --> 00:25:38,929
[Jin Hee's eliminated just as
Ha Ha had predicted?]

424
00:25:38,930 --> 00:25:44,675
[Was this written into his future?]

425
00:25:48,251 --> 00:25:53,189
[Still upset]

426
00:25:53,818 --> 00:25:56,637
It should've gone the opposite way,
but he went back to the same side.

427
00:25:57,658 --> 00:25:59,158
If you think about it...

428
00:26:00,056 --> 00:26:02,432
number two was eliminated
at the first mission.

429
00:26:02,433 --> 00:26:06,664
[During the first stop,
number two, Chang Ui was eliminated.]

430
00:26:07,143 --> 00:26:09,558
And during the second mission,
number one was eliminated.

431
00:26:09,559 --> 00:26:15,476
[Second stop,
number one, Suk Jin was eliminated.]

432
00:26:16,892 --> 00:26:19,631
And since number three was eliminated
during the third mission...

433
00:26:19,632 --> 00:26:23,594
[Third stop, number three,
Jin Hee's eliminated.]

434
00:26:24,963 --> 00:26:28,725
So during the fourth mission,
I wonder if number four will be eliminated?

435
00:26:28,726 --> 00:26:30,204
[For the fourth mission,
number four will be eliminated?]

436
00:26:30,204 --> 00:26:32,057
[Could... could it?]

437
00:26:32,058 --> 00:26:35,549
Ji Sung is the only one left out of
the guests that are here today.

438
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:37,177
[Ji Sung, the sole survivor out of
'The Great Seer' team.]

439
00:26:38,764 --> 00:26:40,861
[Choosing the order for the next mission.]

440
00:26:42,195 --> 00:26:43,394
One, two, three!

441
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:47,192
[Jong Kook, number six.]

442
00:26:50,102 --> 00:26:52,720
- One, two, three!
- Number two!

443
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,266
[Number two again?]

444
00:26:54,267 --> 00:26:55,743
Number two for the third time in a row!

445
00:26:55,744 --> 00:26:57,439
Seriously...

446
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,685
One, two, three!

447
00:26:58,686 --> 00:27:01,645
[Ji Sung, number four!]

448
00:27:01,646 --> 00:27:06,589
[Hm... number four that Jin Hee
predicted...]

449
00:27:06,589 --> 00:27:10,222
[Ji Sung is chosen.]

450
00:27:10,223 --> 00:27:13,551
- It's a relief that you're not number one.
- One, two, three!

451
00:27:13,552 --> 00:27:16,059
[Ji Hyo, number five!]

452
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:17,548
One, two, three!

453
00:27:17,549 --> 00:27:20,116
Number one! What the heck is this?

454
00:27:20,117 --> 00:27:23,624
Why am I number one? Why? Why!

455
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:26,722
[Kwang Soo, number three]

456
00:27:26,723 --> 00:27:28,627
I thought I was going to get number one.

457
00:27:28,628 --> 00:27:31,334
Why are you putting me through
this ordeal?

multiplication question, you pass.]</i>

460
00:27:34,554 --> 00:27:36,611
I'm really bad at this!

461
00:27:36,612 --> 00:27:38,776
This is something that we can all pass!

462
00:27:38,777 --> 00:27:40,237
- 7 times 7?
- 49.

463
00:27:40,238 --> 00:27:41,654
- 7 times 8?
- 56.

464
00:27:41,655 --> 00:27:43,255
- 6 times 7?
- 42!

465
00:27:43,256 --> 00:27:44,423
He's good.

466
00:27:44,424 --> 00:27:46,527
[This game can go to the latter numbers too?]

467
00:27:46,528 --> 00:27:48,206
- 9 times 8?
- 72.

468
00:27:48,774 --> 00:27:50,381
Jae Suk is really good...

469
00:27:50,382 --> 00:27:51,913
- 9 times 9?
- 81.

470
00:27:51,914 --> 00:27:53,771
What do you mean, I'm good?

471
00:27:53,772 --> 00:27:55,901
As soon as I answered 9 times 8 right...

472
00:27:55,902 --> 00:27:58,653
Ji Hyo says, 'Jae Suk is so good....'

473
00:28:00,857 --> 00:28:04,677
- I'm not very good at being quick like that.
- Multiplication table isn't about quickness.

474
00:28:06,277 --> 00:28:07,576
We're here, we're here!

475
00:28:09,603 --> 00:28:12,782
[The fourth station, Osu Station]

- How is that 42?

- 'How is that about quickness?'

I'm seriously so upset by this...

Kwang Soo...

494
00:29:19,002 --> 00:29:22,315
He was just asking how
it's about quickness...

495
00:29:22,316 --> 00:29:23,938
Multiplication table is all about
being quick.

496

Multiplication table is all about
being quick on your feet.

497

I can't believe this...

498
00:29:31,947 --> 00:29:35,220
Also... we've never been wrong once
about the predictions that we've made.

499

There is goes again, there it goes...

501
00:29:45,412 --> 00:29:49,342
[All of a sudden,
reciting the multiplication table...]

502
00:29:49,343 --> 00:29:51,942
[8 times 6= 42?]

503
00:29:51,943 --> 00:29:53,971
Ah, 8 times 6 is 48...

504
00:29:56,972 --> 00:30:00,950
[The fourth person to be eliminated,
Lee Kwang Soo.]

505
00:30:06,089 --> 00:30:07,865
[The three eliminated members who've
been reunited during some time.]

506
00:30:07,865 --> 00:30:11,943
Then are the three of us teamed together
to rip off their name tags?

507
00:30:11,944 --> 00:30:13,600
We don't know about that.
We'll have to wait to see what happens.

508
00:30:13,601 --> 00:30:15,383
You know what the worst is?

509
00:30:15,383 --> 00:30:17,873
When you watch the show broadcasted at home
and finally realize then what was going on.

510
00:30:18,626 --> 00:30:20,360
Wondering during filming,
'What the heck is going on?'

511
00:30:20,361 --> 00:30:21,993
[ Ah... I see...]

512
00:30:22,542 --> 00:30:24,288
That's seriously happened to me before.

513
00:30:24,289 --> 00:30:25,336
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

514
00:30:26,688 --> 00:30:30,873
Jin Hee's usually on the serious side,
but he seems to like coming on Running Man.

515
00:30:30,874 --> 00:30:32,360
Yes, it's fun. It's so much fun.

516
00:30:32,361 --> 00:30:37,277
That's why I keep wanting to come on the show.
And the recent thing that happened with Gary?

517
00:30:37,278 --> 00:30:40,116
I thought that it was my chance
to come on the show permanently.

518
00:30:42,972 --> 00:30:45,614
- Even though I felt bad towards Gary...
- Even though you felt bad?

519
00:30:45,615 --> 00:30:49,028
I thought that it would be the perfect
spot for me to become a member

520
00:30:49,029 --> 00:30:52,771
so I suddenly thought that it was my chance
and that I should give the writers a call.

521
00:30:52,772 --> 00:30:54,535
- I seriously thought that.
- Really?

522
00:30:54,536 --> 00:30:56,521
I really thought that I could do it.

523
00:30:56,522 --> 00:31:00,785
Geun Young was on the show last week
and asked if she could become a member.

524
00:31:00,786 --> 00:31:05,924
Even though that wouldn't be bad...
I think I would be better than her.

525
00:31:06,925 --> 00:31:09,422
[What nice things to say...]

526
00:31:09,423 --> 00:31:14,495
I'm not interested in other ones...
but I do have an interest in Running Man.

527
00:31:14,496 --> 00:31:16,008
But what is the deal with this?

528
00:31:16,009 --> 00:31:18,858
The nameplate isn't on there completely
like usual and it looks easy to tear off.

529
00:31:18,859 --> 00:31:20,896
- This is how they are lately.
- So they rip off easily?

530
00:31:20,897 --> 00:31:21,974
The new ones are like this now.

531
00:31:21,975 --> 00:31:25,286
- This is new...
- It must be the new style.

532
00:31:25,287 --> 00:31:28,070
They're coming out now so that it's
much easier to tear off than the old ones.

533
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:30,743
Who knows what the 2013 models
will be like?

534
00:31:31,575 --> 00:31:33,732
[The name tags are always evolving...]

535
00:31:41,612 --> 00:31:43,396
Ji Hyo, Ji Hyo...

536
00:31:44,447 --> 00:31:49,823
<i>[Everyone starts hoola hooping simultaneously,
and the first one to drop it is eliminated.]</i>

537
00:31:49,823 --> 00:31:51,670
I'm horrible with the hoola hoop.

538
00:31:51,671 --> 00:31:53,074
<i>The order isn't important with this one</i>

539
00:31:53,075 --> 00:31:56,399
<i>so grab one and start hoola hooping
the moment you get off the train.</i>

540
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:59,932
<i>You have to keep going until someone
drops their hoola hoop first.</i>

541
00:31:59,933 --> 00:32:01,165
<i>But...</i>

542
00:32:01,166 --> 00:32:03,870
<i>The time you have for the stop
at the next station is five minutes.</i>

543
00:32:03,871 --> 00:32:06,476
[Five minutes at the next station?]

544
00:32:06,477 --> 00:32:10,125
If I can keep going to the very end...
do I get the Ddak-Ji?

545
00:32:10,126 --> 00:32:14,096
<i>If you're left standing to the end,
then you'll get to have your own Ddak-Ji.</i>

546
00:32:14,097 --> 00:32:16,119
I need to become a Tosa
who sees into the future.

547
00:32:16,702 --> 00:32:18,781
Since it's a Tosa who's good
at hitting with the Ddak-Ji...

548
00:32:24,268 --> 00:32:27,602
A Tosa who's good at wrestling,
or a Tosa who's good with Ddak-Ji...

549
00:32:27,603 --> 00:32:30,082
[This humiliating insult...]

550
00:32:31,857 --> 00:32:35,888
[The fifth station, Namwon Station]

551
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:41,578
[Practicing before getting off.]

552
00:32:41,579 --> 00:32:43,553
I don't know about this...
I really am bad at this.

553
00:32:43,554 --> 00:32:46,129
I'll be the first one who drops it.
I really am bad with hoola hoops.

554

[Opening the door...]

555
00:32:52,592 --> 00:32:53,874
Okay, everyone grab one!

556
00:32:53,875 --> 00:32:55,060
Let's all each grab one.

557
00:32:55,061 --> 00:32:57,075
Here you go.

558
00:32:58,432 --> 00:33:00,626
[Everyone grabbing a hoola hoop.]

559
00:33:00,627 --> 00:33:02,194
I seriously am so bad at this...

560

561
00:33:09,267 --> 00:33:10,924

562
00:33:16,777 --> 00:33:21,398

[The remaining starts celebrating.]

566

I don't know the trick to do this...
I just didn't know...

567
00:33:47,252 --> 00:33:48,424
Jong Kook!

568
00:33:51,424 --> 00:33:52,906
We did it...

569
00:33:54,234 --> 00:33:55,732
Kim Jong Kook was eliminated.

570

right away.]

Everyone, come look.
Come look at something funny.

572
00:34:10,494 --> 00:34:12,285
It's especially fun watching him do it
in his yellow shorts.

573
00:34:12,286 --> 00:34:14,111
It's so much funnier in his shorts.

574
00:34:14,112 --> 00:34:17,354
[The man in the yellow shorts
who's just not getting the concept.]

575
00:34:23,192 --> 00:34:24,981
Isn't it so funny?

576
00:34:24,982 --> 00:34:26,645
He really is horrible at it!

577
00:34:27,876 --> 00:34:29,554
I'm usually so good at this kind of thing!

578
00:34:29,555 --> 00:34:30,724
[His damaged pride.]

579
00:34:37,587 --> 00:34:39,599

his strength...

584

Why couldn't I do this earlier?

585
00:34:59,844 --> 00:35:01,899
He figured it out so quickly...

586
00:35:03,567 --> 00:35:04,969
I bet he's upset...

587
00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:06,980
What a loss he must feel...

588
00:35:06,981 --> 00:35:08,356
This is actually pretty easy.

589

[Mr. Capable becoming an expert at
hoola hooping within moments.]

590

I'm good at it now...

591
00:35:15,829 --> 00:35:18,375
You were talking about how badly
you wanted to become a Tosa...

592

[Quick to notice game.]

601
00:35:54,511 --> 00:35:56,810
As soon as this game starts,
I'm going to shout out one.

602
00:35:56,810 --> 00:35:58,929
I don't care whether it's duplicated or not,
but that's the number I'm saying.

603
00:35:58,930 --> 00:36:02,123
Then it'll be duplicated since it means
the game will start over. It's a good thing!

604
00:36:02,124 --> 00:36:05,886
I'm unconditionally going to say one.

Let's not exhaust each other, okay?

606
00:36:09,128 --> 00:36:10,860
I'm going to duplicate it,

Don't annoy me with this, okay?

608

starts to pull out, we have to get back on?

we're going to stop there.</i>

665
00:39:15,877 --> 00:39:19,026
- I'll tell you the game when we get off.
- You can tell us what it is now.

666
00:39:19,027 --> 00:39:20,858
No, I'll tell you when we get off.
Everyone will be participating.

667
00:39:20,859 --> 00:39:23,439
[Everyone has to participate again.]
That's not fair!

668
00:39:24,356 --> 00:39:28,214
- We have a totally different game prepared...
- No way!

669
00:39:28,215 --> 00:39:31,094
That's not fair!

670
00:39:32,296 --> 00:39:35,788
[Gurae Station]

671
00:39:42,406 --> 00:39:45,290
<i>Ready... set... go!</i>

672
00:39:46,258 --> 00:39:50,100
[The final game is, 'Round and Round'.]

673
00:39:56,323 --> 00:39:58,429
<i>Two people!</i>

674
00:40:06,290 --> 00:40:08,742
[Ha Ha eliminated...]

675
00:40:09,144 --> 00:40:11,210
Serves you right!

676
00:40:16,770 --> 00:40:19,825
Wow... I'm about to break down
in tears.

677
00:40:21,761 --> 00:40:23,981
- That was awesome.
- That was such a great game.

678
00:40:23,982 --> 00:40:25,617
He totally deserved it.

679
00:40:25,618 --> 00:40:28,669
- How deserving for Ha Ha to get eliminated.
- That was a very fitting game!

680
00:40:28,670 --> 00:40:30,920
I noticed how you guys
just latched onto each other.

681
00:40:30,921 --> 00:40:34,295
There was only one person
that I needed to turn to.

682
00:40:35,129 --> 00:40:37,637
At times like this,
we really do seem to be in sync.

683
00:40:38,887 --> 00:40:41,609
- Ji Sung and I...
- I think it was very fair this time.

684
00:40:41,610 --> 00:40:43,515
- Seriously...
- That Ha Ha was eliminated...

685
00:40:43,516 --> 00:40:45,053
I think this game was very just.

686
00:40:46,596 --> 00:40:48,494
[Sixth person to be eliminated, Ha Ha]

687
00:40:55,099 --> 00:40:57,831
<i>Then does it mean...
I'm a Tosa who can see into the future?</i>

688
00:40:57,832 --> 00:41:00,124
<i>Yes. As I have told you all before...</i>

689
00:41:00,125 --> 00:41:04,149
<i>These are the future Ddak-Ji's that I'm giving
to you all for remaining to the end.</i>

690
00:41:04,150 --> 00:41:05,527
<i>You may open them now.</i>

691
00:41:08,044 --> 00:41:09,064
What is this?

692
00:41:09,065 --> 00:41:15,066
[This is... the future Ddak-Ji?]

693
00:41:17,373 --> 00:41:19,333
<i>[If you throw down the Ddak-Ji
in the future...</i>

694
00:41:19,334 --> 00:41:21,353
<i>while screaming out,
'The one who sees the future'</i>

695
00:41:21,354 --> 00:41:22,530
<i>you can return to the present]</i>

696
00:41:22,530 --> 00:41:24,886
Why do we have to shout it out loud?
That is so embarrassing...

697
00:41:24,887 --> 00:41:27,467
- The one who sees into the future?
- I've always wanted to do this.

698
00:41:27,468 --> 00:41:29,226
You're asking Ji Sung to do that?

699
00:41:29,227 --> 00:41:33,858
[The one who sees into the future?]

700
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:39,231
[This future Ddak-Ji is going to
lead me into the future?]

701
00:41:40,094 --> 00:41:45,656
[And the consequences that follows
after taking a peek into the future is?]

702
00:41:46,817 --> 00:41:48,740
<i>You don't see the future when you
throw it down.</i>

703
00:41:48,741 --> 00:41:52,864
<i>But you throw it down when you want to
return to the present after seeing the future.</i>

704
00:41:52,865 --> 00:41:54,770
This is too difficult for me.
Can I return it?

705
00:41:54,771 --> 00:41:57,087
Present now is a difficult concept for me.

706
00:41:57,088 --> 00:41:59,088
How are you saying
that we can see into the future?

707
00:41:59,089 --> 00:42:00,956
[Your present is more difficult
than the future...]

708
00:42:01,525 --> 00:42:04,660
[You're saying we can see into the future?]

709
00:42:05,842 --> 00:42:08,342
[Just what is the future that they see?]

710
00:42:09,084 --> 00:42:15,398
[The battle scene where Running Man
will be tearing off each other's name tags!]

711
00:42:15,398 --> 00:42:19,707
[The ultimate filming location situated
in Jeollado Sooncheon!]

712
00:42:19,707 --> 00:42:24,508
[Old streets, Shantytown, and the
streets of the poor have been reproduced.]

713
00:42:26,063 --> 00:42:29,077
[The four Tosas who arrived on the train
are the first to enter.]

714
00:42:29,078 --> 00:42:31,128
Isn't it amazing how they made all this stuff?

715
00:42:32,058 --> 00:42:38,284
[Feeling as though they're walking through
an old town from back in old times.]

716
00:42:38,285 --> 00:42:40,020
- This is...
- Oops!

717
00:42:40,021 --> 00:42:44,148
[Everyone is on their own from now on,
so need to be weary of one another...]

718
00:42:44,149 --> 00:42:45,450
I was just trying it out.

719
00:42:46,436 --> 00:42:49,877
[The ones who've been eliminated at the
train stations also enter the set.]

720
00:42:51,096 --> 00:42:53,532
Let's go... I like the Shantytown.

721
00:42:54,922 --> 00:42:56,810
I need to go to the bathroom.

722
00:43:01,695 --> 00:43:04,554
[Discovers Giraffe running in on his own!]

723
00:43:05,552 --> 00:43:08,424
I don't know if I should tear his off
the moment he enters or not...

724
00:43:14,717 --> 00:43:16,432
- Kwang Soo!
- No way! No way!

725
00:43:18,677 --> 00:43:21,182
- I have nothing...
- I know.

726
00:43:21,183 --> 00:43:23,602
If I wanted to oust you,
I would've done it already.

727
00:43:23,603 --> 00:43:24,938
You really startled me.

728
00:43:24,939 --> 00:43:28,105
[Deciding to let him live out of pity
since he doesn't even have a Ddak-Ji.]

729
00:43:30,603 --> 00:43:32,226
I'm sure they've already
looked through all this?

730
00:43:36,096 --> 00:43:42,833
[Huh? Now that we're looking, the eliminated
ones seem to be searching for something?]

731
00:43:42,833 --> 00:43:47,227
<i>If you search around on set, future Ddak-Ji's
are hidden throughout the set.</i>

732
00:43:47,227 --> 00:43:49,487
[Future Ddak-Ji's are hidden
throughout this large set!]

733
00:43:49,487 --> 00:43:54,029
[If they find the future Ddak-Ji, the special
skills the Tosas possess' will be theirs too!]

734
00:43:54,030 --> 00:43:57,058
- So the more we have, the better?
- You can look as many Ddak-Ji's as you have.

735
00:43:57,059 --> 00:43:59,212
[More Ddak-Ji's they find,
the more advantageous it is to them.]

736
00:44:00,468 --> 00:44:02,723
I wonder where the Ddak-Ji's are...
where could they be?

737
00:44:05,076 --> 00:44:07,084
[Huh? That is...]

738
00:44:13,734 --> 00:44:18,129
[A future Ddak-Ji in one of the two boxes?]

739
00:44:21,444 --> 00:44:22,789
I'm going to open the other one.

740
00:44:25,628 --> 00:44:28,673
[Danger?]
What the heck does that mean?

741
00:44:28,674 --> 00:44:29,994
What is that? What the heck?

742
00:44:30,527 --> 00:44:33,742
[What? A security personnel is on his tail?]

743
00:44:33,742 --> 00:44:35,142
[If the 'Danger' box is opened,
your location is discovered.]

744
00:44:35,142 --> 00:44:40,208
[If you're caught,
you're frozen on the spot.]

745
00:44:41,473 --> 00:44:42,617
What the heck...

746
00:44:44,249 --> 00:44:47,458
[Chang Ui also opens the Danger box!]

747
00:44:50,744 --> 00:44:56,191
[Sweating profusely as soon as
they arrive on set.]

748
00:44:58,890 --> 00:45:01,425
I've seen Chang Ui twice today,
and this time, he's on the run.

749
00:45:01,425 --> 00:45:03,882
- Is that Chang Ui?
- It's my second time seeing him and look.

750
00:45:04,350 --> 00:45:06,096
I've seen him twice today...

751
00:45:06,097 --> 00:45:08,324
The first time, he was eliminated
and the second time, he's on the run.

752
00:45:08,325 --> 00:45:09,942
That is so funny.

753
00:45:15,385 --> 00:45:18,663
[50% chance. If it's not Danger,
then it's the future Ddak-Ji.]

754
00:45:20,287 --> 00:45:23,775
[Huh?]

755
00:45:26,654 --> 00:45:28,799
[Ha Ha discovers the future Ddak-Ji!]

756
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:31,638
If you shout out, 'The one sees the future',
you can return to the present.

757
00:45:32,164 --> 00:45:34,223
I think I got it...

758
00:45:34,921 --> 00:45:39,834
[Now he has the ability to see into
the future like all the Tosas!]

759
00:45:40,807 --> 00:45:42,648
I feel like I've just died and
gone to heaven.

760
00:45:43,660 --> 00:45:47,257
Race... start!

761
00:45:48,858 --> 00:45:53,205
[Anyways...
it's still a peaceful street for now.]

762
00:45:55,318 --> 00:45:57,825
[But just then...]

763
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:02,500
What is that?

764
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:08,130
[A loud clashing sound out of the blue...]

765
00:46:19,236 --> 00:46:22,238
[Suddenly, all these women...]

766
00:46:30,816 --> 00:46:33,958
[Clueless as to what's going on!]

767
00:46:33,958 --> 00:46:37,162
[Without even having the chance to be
shocked, escaping is their main priority!]

768
00:46:37,162 --> 00:46:39,895
What is this? What the heck is this!

769
00:46:41,189 --> 00:46:42,297
What is this?

770
00:46:42,297 --> 00:46:45,962
[Why are these ladies suddenly...
who are they after?]

771
00:46:45,962 --> 00:46:47,218
What is going on?

772
00:46:49,323 --> 00:46:50,473
What is this?

773
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:51,860
What's going on?

774
00:46:53,001 --> 00:46:54,145
What the heck?

775
00:47:05,757 --> 00:47:07,284
- What is this?
- What?

776
00:47:07,285 --> 00:47:08,774
I don't know!

777
00:47:10,847 --> 00:47:11,988
That totally scared me.

778
00:47:13,047 --> 00:47:14,319
What is it, Jae Suk?

779
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:17,502
[Unknown reason for the attack by
the ladies.]

780
00:47:17,503 --> 00:47:21,249
[Just what is going on in this town?]

781
00:47:21,249 --> 00:47:23,137
I should get up to a high point
and take a look at everything first.

782
00:47:23,138 --> 00:47:26,346
[Jin Hee searching through Shantytown.]

783
00:47:27,036 --> 00:47:28,703
Let's slowly take a look.

784
00:47:30,673 --> 00:47:33,008
I found it!

785
00:47:38,114 --> 00:47:42,041
[The one he picks without hesitation
has the future Ddak-Ji inside it!]

786
00:47:45,707 --> 00:47:49,096
Wow... who knew how reassuring
that would make me feel?

787
00:47:49,097 --> 00:47:50,877
This is what it's like.

788
00:47:53,277 --> 00:47:55,254
[It's Jin Hee...]

789
00:47:55,255 --> 00:47:56,983
- Did you find something?
- No.

790
00:47:57,632 --> 00:48:00,599
But the thing is...
you already have one.

791
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:01,979
- Right?
- Yes, I have one.

792
00:48:02,902 --> 00:48:04,883
Will you give me one?
If you already have two?

793
00:48:06,477 --> 00:48:07,901
You have two, don't you?

794
00:48:07,902 --> 00:48:10,094
- Hey! You have two, right?
- Where did you find yours?

795
00:48:10,095 --> 00:48:11,724
I haven't found one yet.
I'm searching for it right now.

796
00:48:12,001 --> 00:48:15,793
- This is what I have...
- That's what it looks like?

797
00:48:15,794 --> 00:48:18,116
- You only have one?
- Well, but...

798
00:48:18,117 --> 00:48:19,701
Come on... give me one.

799
00:48:20,614 --> 00:48:25,802
Come on, we're going to be shooting a drama
together for the next three months...

800
00:48:26,468 --> 00:48:28,513
But I only have one... only one...

801
00:48:28,514 --> 00:48:30,497
- You only have one?
- Yes.

802
00:48:30,498 --> 00:48:33,316
Then let's do it like this...
since we're here together...

803
00:48:33,317 --> 00:48:35,859
if you find two, then you give me one.

804
00:48:35,860 --> 00:48:38,613
I'll think about it.

805
00:48:39,074 --> 00:48:41,390
- I really think that you have two.
- I'll think about it.

806
00:48:41,955 --> 00:48:43,664
- I'm going to get going, okay?
- Okay.

807
00:48:47,270 --> 00:48:50,967
[Yeah... the more Ddak-Ji's I have,
more advantage I'm going to have...]

808
00:48:56,633 --> 00:49:00,449
[Giraffe seeming to have been
waiting for Jae Suk to come around?]

809
00:49:02,637 --> 00:49:05,384
[What? Ha Ha's waiting too?]

810
00:49:05,385 --> 00:49:08,643
Yes... what are the two of you
planning on doing here?

811
00:49:08,644 --> 00:49:10,636
What do you think we'll be doing?

812
00:49:10,637 --> 00:49:13,362
[Could they be after Yoo-ruce Willis'
future Ddak-Ji?]

813
00:49:15,454 --> 00:49:18,345
[Sensing danger! Let's first escape!]

814
00:49:18,346 --> 00:49:19,721
Jong Kook!

815
00:49:19,722 --> 00:49:21,444
Jong Kook!

816
00:49:23,467 --> 00:49:26,744
[Yoo-ruce Willis making an immediate
U-turn to get out of there!]

817
00:49:26,744 --> 00:49:28,641
That's that Tosas special skill!

818
00:49:29,375 --> 00:49:32,235
Jong Kook! Jong Kook!

819
00:49:33,889 --> 00:49:36,745
- Get him!
- Jong Kook! We're chasing after him!

820
00:49:37,619 --> 00:49:39,238
Jong Kook!

821
00:49:39,239 --> 00:49:42,733
- Chang Ui...
- Catch him!

822
00:49:45,010 --> 00:49:46,897
Are you really going to be like this?

823
00:49:46,898 --> 00:49:48,803
How many Ddak-Ji's do you have?

824
00:49:49,679 --> 00:49:52,261
- I asked you how many Ddak-Ji's you have.
- I only have one Ddak-Ji.

825
00:49:52,262 --> 00:49:55,616
Hey... I trusted him last week,
and had to pay for it.

826
00:49:57,293 --> 00:49:58,746
Let's just get rid of him.

827
00:49:58,747 --> 00:50:02,921
- We are...
- Be-tray-al Cross!

828
00:50:02,921 --> 00:50:04,896
Do you have to get a taste of this
for the two of you to wake up?

829
00:50:06,010 --> 00:50:08,206
Tearing off the name tag isn't the only way
that you can be ousted.

830
00:50:08,207 --> 00:50:10,871
Everyone Tosa has a different skill!

831
00:50:10,872 --> 00:50:12,320
We all have different skills!

832
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:15,256
I'm saying, we all have different skills!

833
00:50:15,257 --> 00:50:18,239
[Yoo-ruce Willis using a bluff to get
him out of his dangerous situation.]

834
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:19,586
I don't care if I get ousted...

835
00:50:19,587 --> 00:50:21,927
I just need to touch someone,
and we're both ousted.

836
00:50:21,928 --> 00:50:23,590
Calm down.

837
00:50:23,591 --> 00:50:27,356
If you need only one person...
I nominate this one.

838
00:50:27,989 --> 00:50:30,250
- Pick him, not me.
- You two decide.

839
00:50:30,251 --> 00:50:32,604
- I nominate him.
- I just need one of you.

840
00:50:33,634 --> 00:50:35,787
[Just then!]

841
00:50:41,434 --> 00:50:45,663
[Assassin Jin Hee approaching from
behind!]

842
00:50:46,914 --> 00:50:48,433
Nice job!

843
00:50:51,907 --> 00:50:53,108
Nice job!

844
00:51:08,983 --> 00:51:11,206
The one who sees into the future!

845
00:51:14,803 --> 00:51:17,169
The one who sees into the future!

846
00:51:17,170 --> 00:51:20,409
[Jae Suk uses his future Ddak-Ji!]

847
00:51:32,321 --> 00:51:38,649
[Yes... I saw it!]

848
00:51:41,203 --> 00:51:48,216
[I saw the future of Jin Hee
tearing off my name tag!]

849
00:51:50,246 --> 00:51:55,418
[I saw it... my own future!]

850
00:51:55,419 --> 00:51:58,440
If you only need one person,
then I nominate this one!

851
00:51:58,441 --> 00:52:00,958
If you only need one person,
then I nominate this one!

852
00:52:00,959 --> 00:52:02,637
No! I'm on your side!

853
00:52:02,638 --> 00:52:06,944
[That's right... this is the future I saw!]

854
00:52:06,944 --> 00:52:10,810
This is when you came up
from behind me, Jin Hee!

855
00:52:10,811 --> 00:52:12,722
This is when you came up
from behind me, Jin Hee!

856
00:52:13,106 --> 00:52:16,389
Jin Hee... he came up from behind me...

857
00:52:19,433 --> 00:52:22,948
[Predicting what's about to happen
from having seen the future!]

858
00:52:22,949 --> 00:52:24,460
How did you know that?

859
00:52:25,721 --> 00:52:29,964
[This is what
the future Ddak-Ji is capable of!]

860
00:52:29,964 --> 00:52:33,998
It means that if I hadn't seen the future,
Jin Hee would've ousted me.

861
00:52:33,999 --> 00:52:38,490
- He would've come up from behind me!
- How do you know that?

862
00:52:38,491 --> 00:52:40,714
I would never do that...
I would've never done that.

863
00:52:40,715 --> 00:52:43,032
The one who sees into the future!

864
00:52:43,033 --> 00:52:45,350
The one who sees into the future!

865
00:52:45,351 --> 00:52:47,300
Hurry up and get him!
What are you all doing?

866
00:52:49,389 --> 00:52:52,333
[And just so... the future was changed]

867
00:52:52,333 --> 00:52:56,096
[However...]

868
00:52:59,762 --> 00:53:07,748
[You have to pay the price...
for looking into the future...]

869
00:53:11,709 --> 00:53:14,188
[What is this going on all of a sudden?]

870
00:53:15,128 --> 00:53:23,203
[Covering them up with a blindfold?]
What is this? What's going on?

871
00:53:23,204 --> 00:53:26,162
What is going on? Where are we going?

872
00:53:27,268 --> 00:53:31,472
[To all the Running Man scattered about...]

873
00:53:31,473 --> 00:53:33,116
What? What is this?

874
00:53:33,905 --> 00:53:37,557
No! No! Don't do this! You can't do this!

875
00:53:38,704 --> 00:53:40,236
You can't...

876
00:53:40,237 --> 00:53:41,888
What is this?

877
00:53:43,395 --> 00:53:49,454
[Why are they blindfolding them,
and where are they being taken to?]

878
00:53:50,508 --> 00:53:56,347
[Huh? Why are they all gathered
in front of the theater?]

879
00:54:02,097 --> 00:54:06,504
[Everyone is being lined up!
Just what...]

880
00:54:13,613 --> 00:54:16,247
[Enemies all around!]

881
00:54:16,247 --> 00:54:22,425
[As soon as the blindfold comes off...
actively attacking one another!]

882
00:54:24,348 --> 00:54:27,273
[Total chaos!]

883
00:54:27,273 --> 00:54:31,169
[This is the karma of Yoo-ruce Willis
having seen into the future!]

884
00:54:31,170 --> 00:54:33,536
- What is this?
- Grab him! Grab him!

885
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:38,365
[Ji Sung going after Ha Ha who has
his hands on Jae Suk!]

886
00:54:47,032 --> 00:54:50,823
[Fine... you tore off my name tag?]

887
00:54:51,431 --> 00:54:54,564
[The future Ddak-Ji that he just found!]

888
00:54:58,024 --> 00:55:01,413
The one who sees the future!

889
00:55:01,414 --> 00:55:03,691
[Ha Ha uses his Ddak-Ji!]

890
00:55:11,848 --> 00:55:18,322
[I saw it... I saw it!
In midst of all the chaos...]

891
00:55:18,323 --> 00:55:25,035
[I saw the future of Ji Sung
tearing off my name tag!]

892
00:55:30,052 --> 00:55:31,873
<i>Everyone back to the previous situation.</i>

893
00:55:35,779 --> 00:55:38,167
- What the heck is this?
- Let's not do this!

894
00:55:39,182 --> 00:55:44,340
[Everyone back to their spots
when they were standing blindfolded.]

895
00:55:44,340 --> 00:55:49,237
[Everyone back to their spots
just before the chaos ensued.]

896
00:55:49,238 --> 00:55:50,994
<i>Everyone back to their spots.</i>

897
00:55:50,995 --> 00:55:53,348
[Everyone to go through the same thing as
done previously with the exception of Ha Ha!]

898
00:55:53,348 --> 00:55:55,081
We're supposed to pretend
none of this happened?

899
00:55:56,073 --> 00:55:57,507
This is seriously so frustrating.

900
00:55:57,508 --> 00:56:00,719
[Other than Ha Ha, no one else saw
the chaos that ensued earlier.]

901
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:05,498
Okay, everyone... everyone stand there.
Sung Yong... Hey! Sung Yong!

902
00:56:05,499 --> 00:56:06,596
Get down here!

903
00:56:06,596 --> 00:56:09,112
Get down here and get ready.
I'm going to escape that way.

904
00:56:09,113 --> 00:56:11,288
[Letting his personal VJ, Song Yong know
of the route he's going to use to escape.]

905
00:56:11,289 --> 00:56:14,036
These people don't know which way
I'm going to escape to.

906
00:56:14,037 --> 00:56:16,310
I'm going to go that way.
I said, come down!

907
00:56:16,311 --> 00:56:17,759
Come down here!

908
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:19,488
- I have to get the full shot.
- Who cares about the full shot?

909
00:56:19,489 --> 00:56:20,966
Come down here.

910
00:56:22,569 --> 00:56:26,027
[Planning his future in detail.]

911
00:56:26,028 --> 00:56:27,714
Okay, everyone stand a little further apart.

912
00:56:30,834 --> 00:56:33,596
[Finally coming back to the present!]

913
00:56:34,925 --> 00:56:37,931
[As soon as the gong sounds, Ha Ha...]

914
00:56:37,932 --> 00:56:41,391
[This is Ha Ha changing the future.]

915
00:56:42,121 --> 00:56:47,192
[In the changed future, instead
of chaos, everyone's a spectator.]

916
00:56:48,267 --> 00:56:52,110
[Everyone getting as far away from
one another as possible for now.]

917
00:56:52,111 --> 00:56:53,754
This is crazy... what the heck is this?

918
00:56:55,202 --> 00:56:59,404
[Whew... I escaped.]

919
00:56:59,625 --> 00:57:01,722
[However...]

920
00:57:02,326 --> 00:57:08,168
[Have you noticed?
That he hasn't been seen anywhere?]

921
00:57:09,340 --> 00:57:13,582
[Why is Big nosed brother in jail
by himself?]

922
00:57:13,583 --> 00:57:16,889
Suk Jin... you're not affected by
the change?

923
00:57:16,890 --> 00:57:20,469
- I was ousted even though I had a Ddak-Ji.
- Seriously?

924
00:57:22,568 --> 00:57:25,219
[Shortly after he entered this place...]

925
00:57:25,220 --> 00:57:27,644
Pick one or the other?
I bet one is good, and the other bad?

926
00:57:29,426 --> 00:57:32,900
[Big nosed brother, who found the
future Ddak-Ji faster than anyone else.]

927
00:57:34,625 --> 00:57:36,838
[And shortly thereafter...]

928
00:57:36,839 --> 00:57:39,602
Just show me the Ddak-Ji once,
just so I know what it looks like.

929
00:57:41,276 --> 00:57:44,842
[Suk Jin showing Chang Ui the Ddak-Ji
upon his request.]

930
00:57:44,843 --> 00:57:47,417
- You can't tell anyone, okay?
- I won't tell anyone.

931
00:57:47,417 --> 00:57:49,495
As you slam this down...

932
00:57:50,356 --> 00:57:54,215
You shout out,
'The one who sees into the future!'

933
00:57:54,215 --> 00:57:58,772
[Oh my... he used it.]

934
00:58:04,398 --> 00:58:08,471
[Just from wanting to show off,
he used the Ddak-Ji to see into the future.]

935
00:58:09,428 --> 00:58:11,299
- Suk Jin...
- What?

936
00:58:11,300 --> 00:58:16,398
I'm sorry...
but can you show me your Ddak-Ji?

937
00:58:16,399 --> 00:58:18,269
Hey...
where do you think I have one?

938
00:58:18,270 --> 00:58:22,308
I just wasted my Ddak-Ji from
having shown it to you!

939
00:58:22,309 --> 00:58:25,409
[My future is having used the Ddak-Ji
after listening to his request...]

940
00:58:25,410 --> 00:58:26,930
Seriously...

941
00:58:27,082 --> 00:58:31,458
[And the karma that followed his action...]

942
00:58:31,459 --> 00:58:33,639
Seriously... that is so absurd.

943
00:58:37,086 --> 00:58:40,180
[The attack by the army of ladies earlier
was from the result of Suk Jin's actions.]

944
00:58:42,118 --> 00:58:45,649
[Chasing Suk Jin to the ends of the earth.]

945
00:58:47,796 --> 00:58:49,359
What are you planning on doing to me?

946
00:58:52,243 --> 00:58:54,837
[Just then...
Ji Hyo starts heading his way!]

947
00:58:54,838 --> 00:58:56,750
Ji Hyo... Ji Hyo, help me!

948
00:58:58,394 --> 00:59:02,468
[So, Ace Ji Hyo...]

949
00:59:05,215 --> 00:59:08,645
[Easily eliminated Big nosed brother!]

950
00:59:11,417 --> 00:59:15,449
[The time is now over, lady army dissipates.]

951
00:59:15,449 --> 00:59:17,110
Ladies... am I out?

952
00:59:17,111 --> 00:59:19,022
- Out!
- What did you say?

953
00:59:22,013 --> 00:59:23,970
This is the time when I need my Ddak-Ji...

954
00:59:25,402 --> 00:59:29,269
[This is how...]

955
00:59:29,269 --> 00:59:32,909
[He ended up here.]

956
00:59:34,012 --> 00:59:39,134
[The use of future Ddak-Ji is key
to winning this battle.]

957
00:59:39,134 --> 00:59:41,066
Let's quickly oust the ones
that have Ddak-Ji on them.

958
00:59:41,067 --> 00:59:42,433
Let's just oust him...

959
00:59:42,434 --> 00:59:46,603
[Targeting Ji Sung who's
guaranteed to have a Ddak-Ji...]

960
00:59:46,604 --> 00:59:50,029
Why me? Why are you targeting me?
Why are you all after me?

961
00:59:50,775 --> 00:59:53,172
- Okay, then I...
- Do you have one?

962
00:59:53,173 --> 00:59:54,926
- You have one, don't you?
- Me?

963
00:59:54,927 --> 00:59:56,798
- Do you have a Ddak-Ji?
- No, I don't have one.

964
00:59:56,799 --> 00:59:58,952
- No, I don't have one...
- I'm coming after you!

965
00:59:58,953 --> 01:00:00,384
What are you doing?

966
01:00:03,850 --> 01:00:06,638
[Ji Sung in extreme danger!]

967
01:00:07,376 --> 01:00:09,094
What's going on? What's going on?

968
01:00:11,306 --> 01:00:13,170
What sin have I committed
by having one of these?

969
01:00:15,996 --> 01:00:18,602
Kwang Soo... do you have a Ddak-Ji?
A Ddak-Ji?

970
01:00:19,460 --> 01:00:22,334
- Do you have a Ddak-Ji?
- No, I don't have one.

971
01:00:22,335 --> 01:00:24,191
We have to go find them.

972
01:00:24,192 --> 01:00:27,096
Jong Kook... Jong Kook...

973
01:00:27,097 --> 01:00:28,947
- Jong Kook has  Ddak-Ji?
- He doesn't have it, but let's eliminate him.

974
01:00:34,354 --> 01:00:37,306
[Ji Sung ultimately being caught
by Mr. Capable!]

975
01:00:37,306 --> 01:00:39,543
[Just what will Ji Sung do?]

976
01:00:42,698 --> 01:00:46,432
[Startles Chang Ui...
backs up into Jong Kook's personal VJ.]

977
01:00:46,433 --> 01:00:49,181
- He has one! He has a Ddak-Ji!
- Why are you so startled?

978
01:00:56,028 --> 01:00:59,560
[Chang Ui eliminates Jae Suk's name tag!]

979
01:01:00,157 --> 01:01:02,062
Chang Ui ousted Jae Suk!

980
01:01:02,063 --> 01:01:06,359
<i>[Yoo Jae Suk, out!
Yoo Jae Suk, out!]</i>

981
01:01:08,003 --> 01:01:10,370
- We have to out Ji Sung! Ji Sung...
- Ji Sung?

982
01:01:10,371 --> 01:01:12,926
- Ji Sung has a Ddak-Ji!
- Why are you doing this to me?

983
01:01:13,488 --> 01:01:15,157
[This is our chance..]

984
01:01:15,157 --> 01:01:17,748
I told you, Ji Sung has a Ddak-Ji.

985
01:01:17,749 --> 01:01:19,988
[Will Ha Ha and Jin Hee use this opportunity
to eliminate Mr. Capable?]

986

[Even Chang Ui is joining in!
Their target is Mr. Capable!]

987
01:01:23,239 --> 01:01:25,359
[Chaos!]

988
01:01:26,687 --> 01:01:29,372
[Kwang Soo caught in a dilemma!]

989
01:01:35,414 --> 01:01:36,710
Who am I supposed to eliminate?

990
01:01:37,499 --> 01:01:39,959
[Kwang Soo, attacking Ji Sung first!]

991
01:01:39,959 --> 01:01:43,912
[Ji Sung, Jong Kook...
who will get ousted first?]

992
01:01:43,913 --> 01:01:45,861
<i>Kwang Soo, hurry!</i>

993
01:01:50,918 --> 01:01:53,681
[Giraffe eliminates Ji Sung's name tag!]

994
01:01:59,119 --> 01:02:01,989
[Ji Sung, ultimately getting out
his future Ddak-Ji!]

995
01:02:01,990 --> 01:02:04,515
The one who sees into the future!

996
01:02:04,516 --> 01:02:06,712
The one who sees into the future!

997
01:02:07,663 --> 01:02:10,297
[Ji Sung uses his future Ddak-Ji!]

998
01:02:19,190 --> 01:02:21,315
[He saw it...]

999
01:02:21,316 --> 01:02:25,984
[I saw the future where Jae Suk
and my name tags are eliminated!]

1000
01:02:35,108 --> 01:02:37,989
Ki Jin, are you okay?
Chang Ui, you weren't after me, right?

1001
01:02:37,990 --> 01:02:40,735
[The same situation as earlier!]

1002
01:02:40,736 --> 01:02:41,842
This is strange!

1003
01:02:41,843 --> 01:02:46,012
[But... it's a different future
than seen earlier?]

1004
01:02:51,295 --> 01:02:57,117
[The price of seeing into the future...
must be paid!]

1005
01:02:57,118 --> 01:02:58,358
What am I doing here?

1006
01:02:58,359 --> 01:03:01,189
[Changing the future]

1007
01:03:01,190 --> 01:03:05,918
[The consequences for it is coming!]

1008
01:03:10,582 --> 01:03:12,996
[The Ladies Army called into attack!]

1009
01:03:12,996 --> 01:03:15,965
[The most fearful consequence!]

1010
01:03:25,805 --> 01:03:28,102
[The most fearful time in this town.]

1011
01:03:30,843 --> 01:03:35,755
[Having to go through it again,
they're not as strong as they were earlier.]

1012
01:03:42,585 --> 01:03:45,817
[Ladies overflowing with tons of energy!]

1013
01:03:49,044 --> 01:03:50,970
Ha Ha, head up. Head up!

1014
01:04:01,531 --> 01:04:03,872
[No matter where you go,
they'll come after you!]

1015
01:04:06,212 --> 01:04:08,579
[Nowhere to run to!]

1016
01:04:08,579 --> 01:04:12,138
[Yoo-ruce Willis caught with
nowhere to escape.]

1017
01:04:14,114 --> 01:04:18,648
[At a quick glance,
it looks like it could be a fan meeting...]

1018
01:04:24,764 --> 01:04:27,217
[Time over. End of consequences!]

1019
01:04:27,217 --> 01:04:29,546
[Just then!]

1020
01:04:30,999 --> 01:04:37,529
[Ace Ji Hyo sneaking up out of nowhere
to eliminate Jae Suk's name tag!]

1021
01:04:39,450 --> 01:04:42,167
[Jae Suk ousted once again.]

1022
01:04:42,168 --> 01:04:48,243
[Ultimately, the future doesn't change.]

1023
01:04:50,541 --> 01:04:56,320
Shouldn't we... shouldn't we do something
with the ones who have a Ddak-Ji?

1024
01:04:56,321 --> 01:04:58,605
- Then we should...
- Jin Hee, you don't have one, do you?

1025
01:04:58,606 --> 01:05:00,511
Of course, I don't.
I haven't even seen one yet.

1026
01:05:00,512 --> 01:05:02,388
I was the last one to get to the set.

1027
01:05:02,389 --> 01:05:06,314
[Jin Hee not admitting that he
has found a future Ddak-Ji to anyone!]

1028
01:05:06,315 --> 01:05:09,338
I came with Chang Ui.
Chang Ui, Suk Jin and I arrived together.

1029
01:05:09,339 --> 01:05:12,522
We were the first ones to get ousted,
and we all came in together.

1030
01:05:12,523 --> 01:05:15,865
I think you have one because
you keep saying weird things.

1031
01:05:15,866 --> 01:05:17,990
- What are you talking about?
- I can tell that you have one.

1032
01:05:17,991 --> 01:05:21,417
- Hey... I don't have one.
- You have at least one, I'm sure of it.

1033
01:05:21,418 --> 01:05:23,356
That's why you kept asking me
about it, right?

1034
01:05:23,357 --> 01:05:25,543
I'm sorry,
but I'm going to check your shoe.

1035
01:05:28,509 --> 01:05:30,915
[Caught!]

1036
01:05:32,937 --> 01:05:38,114
[Since he's caught having it hidden
in his shoe, he's on the run!]

1037
01:05:38,115 --> 01:05:41,455
- We have to get anyone who has a Ddak-Ji!
- He has one!

1038
01:05:41,456 --> 01:05:42,592
Yeah, he has one...

1039
01:05:42,592 --> 01:05:45,654
[Jin Hee, you're really in trouble now...]

1040
01:05:45,655 --> 01:05:47,268
I can't believe that he lied to us!

1041
01:05:47,269 --> 01:05:50,634
Just like you said...
let's make them use their Ddak-Ji's.

1042
01:05:53,009 --> 01:05:56,017
If those guys... work together, I'm dead.

1043
01:05:56,777 --> 01:05:58,194
I need to go and hide.

1044
01:05:59,831 --> 01:06:02,470
- Wait... you don't have one?
- I already used mine.

1045
01:06:02,471 --> 01:06:04,015
- But you could have two.
- As far as I know...

1046
01:06:04,015 --> 01:06:06,745
There's a person amongst you
who has a Ddak-Ji too!

1047
01:06:07,978 --> 01:06:11,898
[Starting to inspect each other after
one parting phrase from Jin Hee.]

1048
01:06:11,899 --> 01:06:15,501
- Seriously... I don't have anything.
- Search Kwang Soo quickly.

1049
01:06:15,502 --> 01:06:16,948
I haven't found anything.

1050
01:06:18,568 --> 01:06:20,962
[Come on... would he really have hidden it
inside his pants?]

1051
01:06:20,963 --> 01:06:23,277
See? He has it. There it is.

1052
01:06:23,278 --> 01:06:26,823
- See? I just saw it. It's right here.
- Where?

1053
01:06:28,573 --> 01:06:30,799
[He hid it inside his underwear!]

1054
01:06:30,800 --> 01:06:32,541
What is this?

1055
01:06:32,542 --> 01:06:34,723
[Without even asking any further questions,
starts the attack on Kwang Soo!]

1056
01:06:39,710 --> 01:06:41,722
[Succeeds in eliminating Kwang Soo's
name tag!]

1057
01:06:41,723 --> 01:06:44,574
What the heck was that?
Hey... how can you lie like that?

1058
01:06:44,575 --> 01:06:47,045
You can throw that away.
That's disgusting.

1059
01:06:47,821 --> 01:06:52,393
[I went through so much trouble
just to find this...]

1060
01:06:57,665 --> 01:07:00,966
[Who ever knew I'd have to use it
like this?]

1061
01:07:00,966 --> 01:07:03,923
The one who sees into the future!

1062
01:07:03,924 --> 01:07:05,303
[Kwang Soo uses his future Ddak-Ji!]

1063
01:07:05,304 --> 01:07:07,647
This Ddak-Ji wasn't meant to use like this...

1064
01:07:13,697 --> 01:07:15,337
- I really don't have it.
- You really don't have it?

1065
01:07:15,338 --> 01:07:17,574
I really don't have it.
Are you sure you don't have it?

1066
01:07:17,575 --> 01:07:19,503
- I really don't have it!
- Okay then, search him.

1067
01:07:19,504 --> 01:07:21,034
- You really don't have it?
- I really don't have it.

1068
01:07:21,035 --> 01:07:22,926
- I really don't have it.
- You really don't have it.

1069
01:07:23,592 --> 01:07:25,047
I told you, I don't have it.

1070
01:07:25,048 --> 01:07:27,772
[A safer future with the use
of his future Ddak-Ji.]

1071
01:07:29,863 --> 01:07:34,315
[However... there are still consequences.]

1072
01:07:38,065 --> 01:07:41,402
[Huh? What's going to happen this time?]

1073
01:07:42,953 --> 01:07:49,821
[What? Their name tags...
are being switched?]

1074
01:07:52,664 --> 01:07:55,788
<i>Until one of those two are ousted,
their name tags will remain swapped.</i>

1075
01:07:55,789 --> 01:07:57,358
Excuse me?

1076
01:07:58,254 --> 01:08:00,731
Please rip it off my back...
please rip it off my back!

1077
01:08:00,732 --> 01:08:04,556
- Wait... just wait a second.
- Why?

1078
01:08:04,591 --> 01:08:06,009
- I like this...
- Jong Kook...

1079
01:08:07,042 --> 01:08:09,092
Jong Kook, come on...

1080
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:12,992
Out! Dong Hoon, out!
Dong Hoon, out!

1081
01:08:13,084 --> 01:08:17,694
[Kwang Soo assisting Jong Kook
so it's easy to rip off Ha Ha's name tag!]

1082
01:08:17,694 --> 01:08:19,200
Ha Dong Hoon, out!

1083
01:08:20,037 --> 01:08:22,914
<i>[Ha Ha, out! Ha Ha, out!]</i>

1084
01:08:23,765 --> 01:08:26,110
The one who sees the future!

1085
01:08:26,111 --> 01:08:28,503
Let's do this again... just one more time.

1086
01:08:28,504 --> 01:08:30,109
I'll buy someone's future Ddak-Ji
off of them!

1087
01:08:30,761 --> 01:08:33,049
What a cheat...

1088
01:08:39,997 --> 01:08:44,345
I guess they can't shoot the dramas
unless they build sets like this one here.

1089
01:08:45,419 --> 01:08:49,687
[The streets that only remains in our memories
that can only be seen on a filming set.]

1090
01:08:49,688 --> 01:08:51,857
Who's that? Ji Hyo, you...

1091
01:08:51,858 --> 01:08:56,405
[The culprit who's responsible for
putting both Suk Jin and Jae Suk away.]

1092
01:08:56,406 --> 01:08:58,163
Do you see the expression on her face?

1093
01:08:58,164 --> 01:09:01,244
Her expression says,
'What? You've never ousted me before?'

1094
01:09:02,178 --> 01:09:03,892
[Serves you right...]

1095
01:09:03,893 --> 01:09:05,552
Seriously... that Blank Ji Hyo.

1096
01:09:06,793 --> 01:09:11,242
- Saw that you went to a club in Busan!
- Yes, I did. I went to a club. So what?

1097
01:09:11,243 --> 01:09:13,133
I went and danced all night! So what?

1098
01:09:13,134 --> 01:09:16,099
Hey... when Gangnam Style came on,
she just went crazy.

1099
01:09:18,323 --> 01:09:22,746
[Internet search -
Song Ji Hyo's horse dance in Busan Club]

1100
01:09:27,687 --> 01:09:30,302
I have no idea what's going on right now.

1101
01:09:37,433 --> 01:09:38,542
Here it is...

1102
01:09:38,542 --> 01:09:40,836
[50% chance...]

1103
01:09:41,715 --> 01:09:43,115
I think it's going to be this one.

1104
01:09:46,535 --> 01:09:51,181
[At last... Chang Ui
discovers a future Ddak-Ji!]

1105
01:09:55,718 --> 01:09:57,317
Let's do something...

1106
01:09:57,317 --> 01:09:58,871
Let's work together until
all Ddak-Ji's are gone.

1107
01:09:58,872 --> 01:10:01,865
- The weak ones have to work together.
- Then we're working together right now?

1108
01:10:01,866 --> 01:10:03,255
How can those words
even come out of your mouth?

1109
01:10:03,256 --> 01:10:04,635
Let's not betray each other.

1110
01:10:05,639 --> 01:10:08,949
[These three working together
to eliminate anyone with a Ddak-Ji!]

1111
01:10:08,950 --> 01:10:11,433
- Let's go.
- Why is he here?

1112
01:10:11,434 --> 01:10:13,254
What do we do with him?

1113
01:10:13,255 --> 01:10:16,494
[Of all places... why come here?]

1114
01:10:16,495 --> 01:10:18,667
Let's talk to him first.

1115
01:10:19,452 --> 01:10:21,259
- Where's Jin Hee?
- Do you have a Ddak-Ji or not?

1116
01:10:21,260 --> 01:10:25,960
As of right now... Jin Hee and Gary have one.

1117
01:10:25,961 --> 01:10:27,124
Really?

1118
01:10:27,124 --> 01:10:28,961
Are you pretending not to have one
when you actually do have one?

1119
01:10:28,962 --> 01:10:30,738
- I really don't have one.
- We have to get rid of them first.

1120
01:10:30,739 --> 01:10:32,501
- Come here.
- You're acting strange.

1121
01:10:38,318 --> 01:10:41,908
[Like a thief tripping over his own foot.]

1122
01:10:41,909 --> 01:10:44,581
- I seriously don't have one!
- Calm down!

1123
01:10:44,582 --> 01:10:46,521
Grab him... just grab him!

1124
01:10:53,212 --> 01:10:56,011
[Very... easily eliminates Chang Ui's
name tag.]

1125
01:10:56,012 --> 01:10:59,833
[He just barely found his Ddak-Ji...]

1126
01:10:59,834 --> 01:11:01,773
- Do you have a Ddak-Ji or not?
- Do you have one?

1127
01:11:01,774 --> 01:11:06,337
[I'll show you... Ta da!]

1128
01:11:06,338 --> 01:11:08,534
[Chang Ui showing off his future Ddak-Ji!]

1129
01:11:10,449 --> 01:11:12,444
Where are they all getting them from?

1130
01:11:13,204 --> 01:11:15,307
The one who sees the future!

1131
01:11:17,572 --> 01:11:20,963
[Chang Ui uses his future Ddak-Ji!]

1132
01:11:29,139 --> 01:11:33,180
[I saw it...
I saw the future where I'm eliminated!]

1133
01:11:33,181 --> 01:11:35,219
- Chang Ui...
- Wait! Wait!

1134
01:11:35,220 --> 01:11:38,304
You're going to grab me
and rip my name off, aren't you?

1135
01:11:38,305 --> 01:11:40,689
I saw it! I saw the future!

1136
01:11:40,690 --> 01:11:43,587
- What would you like to do?
- Work together...

1137
01:11:43,588 --> 01:11:47,090
- Let's all get Jin Hee first.
- Right?

1138
01:11:47,091 --> 01:11:49,941
Right now... there are three Tosas left.

1139
01:11:49,942 --> 01:11:52,910
- We have to do whatever to get...
- Don't rip it off!

1140
01:11:52,911 --> 01:11:55,063
While there are still a few of us left.

1141
01:11:55,753 --> 01:11:58,976
[The consequences of seeing
into the future must be paid!]

1142
01:11:58,977 --> 01:12:00,808
Let's make them use their Ddak-Ji's.

1143
01:12:00,809 --> 01:12:03,192
- What are you doing?
- They're swapping it out again.

1144
01:12:04,426 --> 01:12:11,054
[This time... Jong Kook and Chang Ui's
names are being swapped?]

1145
01:12:11,572 --> 01:12:15,708
[The strongest and the weakest
players names were swapped!]

1146
01:12:15,709 --> 01:12:17,736
What do we do now?

1147
01:12:17,737 --> 01:12:21,213
- Chang Ui...
- Hold still! I said, hold still!

1148
01:12:22,273 --> 01:12:23,907
- You have to protect it, okay?
- I'll protect it.

1149
01:12:23,908 --> 01:12:26,162
Do you understand?
You understand?

1150
01:12:26,163 --> 01:12:30,318
[Subconsciously,
his hand goes to Jong Kook's name...]

1151
01:12:31,257 --> 01:12:34,169
We have to work together.
We all have to work together.

1152
01:12:34,170 --> 01:12:36,174
- No, I'm okay.
- You're okay if I do this.

1153
01:12:36,175 --> 01:12:40,194
[Jong Kook and Chang Ui have to
protect each other's backs.]

1154
01:12:40,922 --> 01:12:45,162
[But will the alliance between
these four last long?]

1155
01:12:47,391 --> 01:12:49,516
I think they're coming to get us
right now.

1156
01:12:49,517 --> 01:12:51,078
- I think they're coming for us.
- They're coming to eliminate us.

1157
01:12:51,079 --> 01:12:54,623
[It won't be easy
to handle all four of them...]

1158
01:12:55,704 --> 01:12:57,991
- But we have to work together.
- Should we?

1159
01:12:59,322 --> 01:13:02,539
All three of them over there have
Ddak-Ji's.

1160
01:13:03,771 --> 01:13:06,228
[The three people guaranteed of
their future.]

1161
01:13:06,229 --> 01:13:08,359
Jong Kook... you take Jin Hee.

1162
01:13:09,715 --> 01:13:11,248
Wait. Stop!

1163
01:13:11,249 --> 01:13:12,742
Wait. Stop!

1164
01:13:12,743 --> 01:13:15,463
Do we have to stop just because
he tells us to stop?

1165
01:13:15,464 --> 01:13:16,990
Why would we stop?

1166
01:13:16,991 --> 01:13:20,336
Wait... something doesn't feel right.

1167
01:13:20,337 --> 01:13:22,673
- What are you doing, Jin Hee?
- No, something doesn't feel right.

1168
01:13:22,674 --> 01:13:25,016
Why are you running away?
What do we do right now?

1169
01:13:25,017 --> 01:13:28,500
You have to use your Ddak-Ji...
you have to use it!

1170
01:13:28,501 --> 01:13:30,695
[Jong Kook's saying he'll let them live
if they use their future Ddak-Ji's...]

1171
01:13:30,696 --> 01:13:33,790
[Arguing back and forth as to
who should use their Ddak-Ji's first.]

1172
01:13:33,791 --> 01:13:36,529
- Let's decide by playing Rock-paper-scissors.
- Fine, just one round.

1173
01:13:36,530 --> 01:13:39,202
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Okay, the loser has to use it then.

1174
01:13:39,203 --> 01:13:40,776
- Rock-paper-scissors!
- Rock-paper-scissors!

1175
01:13:41,492 --> 01:13:46,294
[Gary's hand straying to Jin Hee's back!]

1176
01:13:48,938 --> 01:13:51,805
[Gary rids Jin Hee of his name tag!]

1177
01:13:52,502 --> 01:13:56,717
[Ultimately having to drag out the
future Ddak-Ji hidden in his sock...]

1178
01:13:59,748 --> 01:14:02,663
The one who sees the future!

1179
01:14:03,812 --> 01:14:06,218
[Jin Hee uses his future Ddak-Ji!]

1180
01:14:08,948 --> 01:14:11,590
[Jin Hee ultimately takes a look
into his future!]

1181
01:14:12,686 --> 01:14:17,416
[Returning to the scene right before
they play Rock-paper-scissors.]

1182
01:14:20,486 --> 01:14:23,616
Rock...
wait, I think you're going to betray me.

1183
01:14:23,617 --> 01:14:25,876
Why would I betray you?
How can you say that?

1184
01:14:25,877 --> 01:14:28,148
You can feel it, can't you?

1185
01:14:28,149 --> 01:14:29,872
- The loser has to use it, okay?
- Okay.

1186
01:14:29,873 --> 01:14:31,206
- Rock-paper-scissors!
- Rock-paper-scissors.

1187
01:14:33,791 --> 01:14:35,610
You're acting really strange.

1188
01:14:35,611 --> 01:14:38,278
It's because I'm getting a weird feeling.

1189
01:14:38,279 --> 01:14:39,519
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

1190
01:14:39,520 --> 01:14:42,165
[Jin Hee loses all on his own!]

1191
01:14:43,250 --> 01:14:47,355
[This is how Jin Hee changed the future
and remained alive!]

1192
01:14:52,802 --> 01:14:55,912
[Another consequence
for looking into the future!]

1193
01:14:57,911 --> 01:14:58,994
What is it? What is it?

1194
01:14:58,995 --> 01:15:00,604
What are you doing? What's this for?

1195
01:15:01,850 --> 01:15:06,784
[Being blindfolded again...
What is it this time?]

1196
01:15:06,785 --> 01:15:08,328
You want me to go in?

1197
01:15:09,758 --> 01:15:15,158
[Separating them from one another
far away from each other.]

1198
01:15:17,736 --> 01:15:21,285
Is someone next to me again
like before in front of the theater?

1199
01:15:23,348 --> 01:15:24,700
Why isn't anyone else around?

1200
01:15:26,801 --> 01:15:28,009
Jong Kook!

1201
01:15:29,616 --> 01:15:30,947
Jong Kook!

1202
01:15:32,079 --> 01:15:33,410
Chang Ui!

1203
01:15:34,072 --> 01:15:35,557
<i>Yeah?</i>

1204
01:15:36,635 --> 01:15:38,469
Is Chang Ui next to me?

1205
01:15:41,006 --> 01:15:44,626
[Everyone is on their own...
far away from one another!]

1206
01:15:45,102 --> 01:15:47,305
[Off with their blindfolds!]

1207
01:15:47,306 --> 01:15:49,371
Chang Ui... Chang Ui!

1208
01:15:49,372 --> 01:15:53,131
[I have to protect my name tag
on Chang Ui's back!]

1209
01:15:53,132 --> 01:15:54,818
Jin Hee! Jin Hee!

1210
01:15:55,282 --> 01:15:56,331
Jin Hee!

1211
01:15:57,698 --> 01:16:00,323
If I don't eliminate Jong Kook's name tag now,
there aren't any other chances to do it!

1212
01:16:00,324 --> 01:16:02,731
It's now or never!

1213
01:16:02,732 --> 01:16:06,076
[Kwang Soo heading off towards Chang Ui
with Jong Kook's name tag on his back!]

1214
01:16:06,077 --> 01:16:07,638
Why would I tear it off?

1215
01:16:08,691 --> 01:16:11,787
We have to work together...
Chang Ui, we have to work together!

1216
01:16:11,788 --> 01:16:13,255
Why? What's going on?

1217
01:16:13,256 --> 01:16:14,709
Chang Ui!

1218
01:16:15,529 --> 01:16:17,112
Chang Ui!

1219
01:16:18,162 --> 01:16:21,826
[Kwang Soo in the meantime reassuring
Chang Ui to get closer to him!]

1220
01:16:21,826 --> 01:16:23,244
Jong Kook!

1221
01:16:24,106 --> 01:16:26,770
Chang Ui, come here!

1222
01:16:28,148 --> 01:16:31,276
[No... I can't lose this chance!]

1223
01:16:32,093 --> 01:16:34,910
Why? Why are you doing this?

1224
01:16:34,910 --> 01:16:38,208
[Kwang Soo attacks Jong Kook's name tag!]

1225
01:16:38,209 --> 01:16:40,598
Chang Ui! Chang Ui! Chang Ui!

1226
01:16:40,599 --> 01:16:42,249
No, Chang Ui!

1227
01:16:43,465 --> 01:16:45,720
- Chang Ui! No! No!
- Why are you doing this?

1228
01:16:45,721 --> 01:16:47,418
<i>Chang Ui! Chang Ui!</i>

1229
01:16:53,470 --> 01:16:55,795
[Jong Kook's name tag eliminated!]

1230
01:16:55,795 --> 01:16:57,611
Chang Ui! Chang Ui...

1231
01:16:57,815 --> 01:16:59,691
Kim Jong Kook, out!

1232
01:17:01,337 --> 01:17:03,106
- You're out.
- Why did you do that?

1233
01:17:03,107 --> 01:17:06,402
- Why did you...
- This was the only chance to do it.

1234
01:17:07,502 --> 01:17:10,698
<i>[Kim Jong Kook, out!
Kim Jong Kook, out!]</i>

1235
01:17:13,542 --> 01:17:19,161
[Chang Ui's name tag on Jong Kook's back
goes back to Chang Ui.]

1236
01:17:19,162 --> 01:17:20,860
- That Lee Kwang Soo...
- Why did you do that?

1237
01:17:20,861 --> 01:17:25,318
In that situation...
this was the only chance I had to rid of him.

1238
01:17:27,346 --> 01:17:28,591
Jong Kook!

1239
01:17:28,592 --> 01:17:32,188
[While he was too busy bragging...]

1240
01:17:32,189 --> 01:17:33,590
[That's right!]

1241
01:17:35,428 --> 01:17:37,290
Jong Kook! I got him!

1242
01:17:38,126 --> 01:17:40,312
<i>Good job! Chang Ui!</i>

1243
01:17:40,313 --> 01:17:42,681
I was in the midst of talking!

1244
01:17:42,682 --> 01:17:46,213
<i>[Lee Kwang Soo, out!
Lee Kwang Soo, out!]</i>

1245
01:17:49,510 --> 01:17:51,087
Someone is being scolded on their
way here.

1246
01:17:52,712 --> 01:17:55,293
Isn't it Jong Kook's voice?
Then it must be Kwang Soo.

1247
01:17:55,294 --> 01:17:58,073
This isn't anything new.
This is what always happens.

1248
01:17:59,500 --> 01:18:00,563
Suk Jin, hurry up and eat the chocolates.

1249
01:18:00,563 --> 01:18:01,920
He's going to say something
about the chocolates.

1250
01:18:02,983 --> 01:18:06,163
[Rushing so they don't get scolded
by their younger Brother, Jong Kook]

1251
01:18:06,164 --> 01:18:07,563
Do we really have to live like this?

1252
01:18:09,340 --> 01:18:12,504
This is not right...
Nothing goes well with him around.

1253
01:18:13,530 --> 01:18:14,768
Seriously...

1254
01:18:14,769 --> 01:18:16,664
- What now?
- Lee Kwang Soo, seriously...

1255
01:18:16,665 --> 01:18:18,037
What are you angry about now?

1256
01:18:19,104 --> 01:18:21,096
What did he do wrong now?

1257
01:18:22,391 --> 01:18:24,719
I think he has some sort of a sickness.

1258
01:18:25,387 --> 01:18:29,185
[Name of the sickness:
Eliminate Jong Kook syndrome.]

1259
01:18:29,186 --> 01:18:33,748
[Symptoms: His whole purpose in life
is to rip off Jong Kook's name tag.]

1260
01:18:33,749 --> 01:18:35,836
- I really love it when you're ousted.
- Is eliminating me your own personal win?

1261
01:18:35,837 --> 01:18:38,190
- I really love it.
- It's like that for you, isn't it, Kwang Soo?

1262
01:18:38,191 --> 01:18:39,946
It's not like that for you?

1263
01:18:39,947 --> 01:18:42,290
To be honest, everyone that's here...

1264
01:18:42,291 --> 01:18:44,022
You're worse! You're worse!

1265
01:18:44,946 --> 01:18:47,552
[Displaying similar symptoms.]

1266
01:18:48,253 --> 01:18:51,031
Let's really try hard
to work together tomorrow.

1267
01:18:52,222 --> 01:18:54,434
Come on, don't be like that.

1268
01:18:54,435 --> 01:18:56,800
If you console him like that,
he's the type to believe it too.

1269
01:18:56,801 --> 01:18:59,540
He's over it already.
Jong Kook's already over it.

1270
01:19:00,821 --> 01:19:02,800
- We're like brothers!
- I'm a little dense...

1271
01:19:02,801 --> 01:19:04,078
Yeah...

1272
01:19:04,079 --> 01:19:07,114
[A man with a soft heart]

1273
01:19:08,529 --> 01:19:11,981
[Not many survivors left remaining.]

1274
01:19:28,045 --> 01:19:31,412
[Easily frightened male survivors.]

1275
01:19:31,413 --> 01:19:32,743
You startled me!

1276
01:19:32,744 --> 01:19:35,311
Why does it feel like we're on the same side
even though I was startled to see you?

1277
01:19:37,187 --> 01:19:38,721
Who is it? Is someone back there?

1278
01:19:41,449 --> 01:19:42,601
<i>Ji Hyo!</i>

1279
01:19:44,502 --> 01:19:46,144
<i>There's no one here. No one here.</i>

1280
01:19:47,936 --> 01:19:49,698
Ji Sung...

1281
01:19:49,699 --> 01:19:53,098
- Ji Sung...
- Oh! There's Ji Sung!

1282
01:19:53,099 --> 01:19:54,886
Oh! There's Ji Sung.

1283
01:19:56,155 --> 01:19:59,679
[It looks as though they've made
a pact to attack Ji Hyo.]

1284
01:20:00,657 --> 01:20:05,675
[Then Ji Sung will attack Ji Hyo?]

1285
01:20:05,676 --> 01:20:09,191
[Ji Sung eliminates Gary's name tag!]

1286
01:20:09,192 --> 01:20:13,410
- Okay, I did it.
- The one who sees the future!

1287
01:20:15,541 --> 01:20:18,499
[Gary uses his future Ddak-Ji!]

1288
01:20:20,262 --> 01:20:23,001
[How will his future change?]

1289
01:20:25,182 --> 01:20:27,110
I knew this would happen!
I knew you'd do this!

1290
01:20:28,151 --> 01:20:31,139
[Figured out Ji Sung would attack
from behind from having seen the future!]

1291
01:20:31,140 --> 01:20:33,032
- I knew you'd sneak up from behind!
- It's a misunderstanding!

1292
01:20:33,786 --> 01:20:36,357
[Everyone heading in their direction!]

1293
01:20:36,358 --> 01:20:38,325
- What is this?
- The ladies! The ladies are coming!

1294
01:20:38,326 --> 01:20:40,704
[The consequences for having
seen the future is starting!]

1295
01:20:40,705 --> 01:20:42,478
Ladies?

1296
01:20:42,479 --> 01:20:44,226
Ladies, ladies!

1297
01:20:47,468 --> 01:20:50,547
[The Lady Army attacks!]

1298
01:21:04,406 --> 01:21:08,628
[The ladies moving even faster than before!]

1299
01:21:09,389 --> 01:21:12,047
[Gary in extreme danger!]

1300
01:21:13,087 --> 01:21:15,814
[Gary caught in their vise-like grip!]

1301
01:21:21,018 --> 01:21:24,704
[If they're to eliminate Gary's name tag,
now is the chance!]

1302
01:21:24,705 --> 01:21:26,594
If not now,
we don't have another chance!

1303
01:21:31,955 --> 01:21:35,611
[The time for consequence is over.]

1304
01:21:35,612 --> 01:21:39,232
[Gary's breaking away!
I have to eliminate him quickly!]

1305
01:21:44,212 --> 01:21:48,814
[Gary endured his consequence!]

1306
01:21:49,451 --> 01:21:50,650
Did anyone get ousted?

1307
01:21:50,650 --> 01:21:52,159
No one got ousted. If they had,
I'm sure it would've been announced.

1308
01:21:54,129 --> 01:21:55,726
Those ladies are the scariest.

1309
01:21:57,003 --> 01:22:01,872
[Survivors:
Gary, Ji Hyo, Jin Hee, Chang Ui, Ji Sung]

1310
01:22:02,547 --> 01:22:04,992
Ji Hyo... you're the only one with
a Ddak-Ji left, right?

1311
01:22:04,993 --> 01:22:07,820
- Why don't we go after Ji Hyo then?
- Shall we?

1312
01:22:07,855 --> 01:22:11,285
If we get rid of her Ddak-Ji,
then we can all start over.

1313
01:22:11,286 --> 01:22:14,367
Okay then... then let's go.

1314
01:22:15,286 --> 01:22:18,561
[Ji Hyo proposes a one on one
against Chang Ui.]

1315
01:22:18,561 --> 01:22:20,598
With me? Why don't you do it?

1316
01:22:20,599 --> 01:22:22,917
You have to do it since you suggested it.

1317
01:22:22,918 --> 01:22:24,893
[I may lose...]

1318
01:22:24,894 --> 01:22:27,051
[Just then...]

1319
01:22:27,052 --> 01:22:31,557
[From behind!]

1320
01:22:36,007 --> 01:22:37,897
[Ji Sung attacks Ji Hyo!]

1321
01:22:37,898 --> 01:22:41,648
[A racket breaks out within moments.]

1322
01:22:41,649 --> 01:22:45,669
[The three guests start their attack
on the Monday Couple!]

1323
01:22:48,131 --> 01:22:50,946
[Jin Hee rids Gary of his name tag!]

1324
01:22:54,542 --> 01:22:56,107
[Fine...]

1325
01:22:56,108 --> 01:22:58,550
[Ace Ji Hyo, at last...]

1326
01:23:02,141 --> 01:23:04,514
The one who sees the future!

1327
01:23:05,399 --> 01:23:08,011
[Her future... how will it change?]

1328
01:23:10,261 --> 01:23:13,576
[I saw it... I saw my future!]

1329
01:23:13,577 --> 01:23:17,600
Something... something is going to happen.
I saw it all.

1330
01:23:17,601 --> 01:23:20,251
<i>Gary... are you going to be catty...</i>

1331
01:23:20,252 --> 01:23:25,171
[Right about this time... is when
Ji Sung attacked me from behind...]

1332
01:23:26,175 --> 01:23:30,356
[Appearing just as she had seen
in her future.]

1333
01:23:35,789 --> 01:23:37,124
The bell rang.

1334
01:23:37,125 --> 01:23:40,444
[Why are the guards grabbing
Ji Sung and Ji Hyo?]

1335
01:23:42,064 --> 01:23:43,928
[This is!]

1336
01:23:43,929 --> 01:23:46,749
[Ji Sung and Ji Hyo name tag change?]

1337
01:23:50,346 --> 01:23:51,872
Ji Hyo, come here.

1338
01:23:52,628 --> 01:23:54,268
[Wait...]

1339
01:23:54,268 --> 01:23:57,170
[The name tag on Ji Hyo's back...]

1340
01:24:06,659 --> 01:24:09,461
[Eliminates Ji Sung's name tag
on Ji Hyo's back!]

1341
01:24:09,462 --> 01:24:13,154
[What! In the meantime!]

1342
01:24:13,155 --> 01:24:15,496
[Jin Hee follows behind
without hesitation...]

1343
01:24:21,975 --> 01:24:26,662
[Even before Ji Hyo's name tag is returned
to her, her name tag is eliminated!]

1344
01:24:26,663 --> 01:24:29,505
<i>[Ji Sung, out! Ji Sung, out!]</i>

1345
01:24:29,505 --> 01:24:32,301
I was going to show you...

1346
01:24:32,301 --> 01:24:34,700
<i>[Song Ji Hyo, out!
Song Ji Hyo, out!]</i>

1347
01:24:34,701 --> 01:24:36,213
[Blank...]

1348
01:24:38,650 --> 01:24:41,459
[The last three remaining-
Gary, Jin Hee, Chang Ui.]

1349
01:24:41,459 --> 01:24:43,887
- Instead of standing around like this...
- No, we just need to get you.

1350
01:24:43,888 --> 01:24:45,165
Why would you get me?

1351
01:24:45,166 --> 01:24:47,488
[The two guests targeting Gary again!]

1352
01:24:47,489 --> 01:24:49,418
We have no other chances to get you.

1353
01:24:52,812 --> 01:24:54,796
[Gary is the first to attack!]

1354
01:24:58,238 --> 01:25:00,584
[By the split of a hair!
Gary eliminates it first!]

1355
01:25:00,942 --> 01:25:03,910
[Gary's lightning fast moves!]

1356
01:25:06,400 --> 01:25:07,929
See? I told you that he was good.

1357
01:25:09,825 --> 01:25:14,876
[Now the final battle!
Gary vs. Jin Hee.]

1358
01:25:15,948 --> 01:25:17,302
That was too bad...

1359
01:25:19,725 --> 01:25:23,321
<i>[Song Chang Ui, out!
Song Chang Ui, out!]</i>

1360
01:25:23,322 --> 01:25:26,055
- Chang Ui's out?
- Then Gary and Jin Hee are left.

1361
01:25:26,056 --> 01:25:27,816
What happened?

1362
01:25:27,817 --> 01:25:30,957
Even though he's fast, Gary's pretty good.

1363
01:25:30,958 --> 01:25:33,662
I think everyone just goes crazy
as soon as they see the name tags.

1364
01:25:33,663 --> 01:25:36,756
- So it's one against one.
- It's no joke out there.

1365
01:25:49,263 --> 01:25:53,720
[A battle that they can't avoid.]

1366
01:25:53,721 --> 01:25:59,012
[Assassin Jin Hee vs. Know-how Gary]

1367
01:26:00,138 --> 01:26:01,310
Jin Hee...

1368
01:26:01,311 --> 01:26:04,211
- It's been... it's been fun.
- It's been very fun.

1369
01:26:04,212 --> 01:26:06,346
[A mental battle going on between
the two.]

1370
01:26:07,227 --> 01:26:09,279
My pride balances on eliminating
your name tag.

1371
01:26:11,156 --> 01:26:14,158
Jin Hee, to rid me of my name tag
is ridding me of my pride!

1372
01:26:14,662 --> 01:26:17,793
[Gary's polished avoidance technique.]

1373
01:26:27,116 --> 01:26:29,977
[Ah! Jin Hee's name tag!]

1374
01:26:34,384 --> 01:26:39,194
[Gary... did it!]

1375
01:26:39,195 --> 01:26:43,733
I won! Me! I won this game!

1376
01:26:43,734 --> 01:26:45,995
I won this battle of Ddak-Ji!

1377
01:26:50,490 --> 01:26:51,813
Jin Hee...

1378
01:26:58,805 --> 01:27:01,279
The one who sees the future...

1379
01:27:04,949 --> 01:27:08,083
[What the...]

1380
01:27:09,231 --> 01:27:12,134
[Then Jin Hee had more than one?]

1381
01:27:14,535 --> 01:27:18,527
[Not long after he found his
first future Ddak-Ji...]

1382
01:27:22,485 --> 01:27:25,525
[He gains another future Ddak-Ji!]

1383
01:27:26,874 --> 01:27:32,856
[Using his brain!
Hiding one so others won't suspect!]

1384
01:27:34,352 --> 01:27:37,811
[That's... how it happened]

1385
01:27:39,124 --> 01:27:41,039
The one who sees the future... is me!

1386
01:27:42,810 --> 01:27:45,671
[Jin Hee uses another future Ddak-Ji!]

1387
01:27:50,827 --> 01:27:54,193
[I saw it...]

1388
01:27:56,728 --> 01:28:02,555
[My future where my name tag was
ripped off my back in the end...]

1389
01:28:02,556 --> 01:28:06,977
[I will change it!]

1390
01:28:11,889 --> 01:28:13,912
To rid me of my name tag is to
rid me of my pride.

1391
01:28:13,913 --> 01:28:16,404
[Returning to the point
right before the battle!]

1392
01:28:18,892 --> 01:28:22,296
- He had two Ddak-Ji's?
- Wow... so he had two?

1393
01:28:22,297 --> 01:28:25,027
- That makes sense...
- Of course, if he found two...

1394
01:28:26,353 --> 01:28:28,659
- I'm positive that I won...
- I'm positive I lost...

1395
01:28:28,660 --> 01:28:32,882
[Earlier was only a future that Jin Hee saw,
this is the only present that matters!]

1396
01:28:37,676 --> 01:28:40,419
[With his teeth!]

1397
01:28:40,420 --> 01:28:43,874
[The final battle where
means no longer matters!]

1398
01:28:45,327 --> 01:28:50,529
[The two who will never
concede their victory!]

1399
01:28:50,530 --> 01:28:54,837
[Just what...]

1400
01:28:55,949 --> 01:28:57,804
- That's Gary's voice.
- They're going at it.

1401
01:28:57,805 --> 01:29:01,426
A part of me thinks Jin Hee may win
because he's wants it so badly

1402
01:29:01,427 --> 01:29:03,092
but Gary tends to have strong
motivations too.

1403
01:29:13,783 --> 01:29:16,715
[Jin Hee taking a chance from a defensive
position to counterattack!]

1404
01:29:16,715 --> 01:29:19,133
[Jin Hee's repeat attack on
Gary's name tag!]

1405
01:29:30,134 --> 01:29:33,748
I know that I won!
How did this happen?

1406
01:29:35,301 --> 01:29:37,922
The one who sees the future!

1407
01:29:51,933 --> 01:29:53,700
I actually won initially...

1408
01:29:56,996 --> 01:29:58,805
[An outburst of accusations]

1409
01:29:59,350 --> 01:30:01,896
- After joining our alliance...
- Why were you working so hard at it?

1410
01:30:02,308 --> 01:30:04,322
- Because of us...
- Yes, thank you.

1411
01:30:04,323 --> 01:30:05,702
What is this?

1412
01:30:07,056 --> 01:30:10,579
[Saying thanks to almost everyone
standing there?]

1413
01:30:10,580 --> 01:30:12,268
All of us were in an alliance.

1414
01:30:12,269 --> 01:30:14,686
How big was your alliance?

1415
01:30:14,687 --> 01:30:17,053
- They all each came to me asking for it.
- Seriously?

1416
01:30:17,054 --> 01:30:18,816
What the heck is this?

1417
01:30:18,817 --> 01:30:21,010
You really are the ultimate traitor.

1418
01:30:21,011 --> 01:30:23,189
I'm the 'Or'
You're 'Tra', he's 'it' and I'm 'or'.

1419
01:30:23,190 --> 01:30:24,656
[Taking a role in the three part 'Traitor'.]

1420
01:30:26,087 --> 01:30:29,116
[The winning prize is given to
Jin Hee alone.]

1421
01:30:29,117 --> 01:30:30,392
What is it?

1422
01:30:32,919 --> 01:30:36,066
[Gold hourglass]

1423
01:30:36,067 --> 01:30:37,500
Is it real gold?

1424
01:30:41,652 --> 01:30:43,941
It's okay, I love it!

1425
01:30:43,942 --> 01:30:45,194
[An honest reaction from Jin Hee.]

1426
01:30:45,195 --> 01:30:48,333
The one who sees into the future
today is, Ji Jin Hee!
