- That suits you very well!

Do I look ugly?
I'm asking if I look ugly.

113
00:06:41,616 --> 00:06:43,691
- Not really ugly, but just weird looking.
- Really?

114

Seriously, Gary...
I wish I looked like you right now.

116

- Is he like that all the time?

119
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:17,607
- I'm so sick of it...
- He's like this all the time?

120

say 'Challenge'?]

128

for falling over?]

146
00:08:42,332 --> 00:08:44,567
Suk Jin has become an icon when it comes
to body gags on this show lately.

147
00:08:45,354 --> 00:08:48,483
We'll get our breakfast only
when we jump over this, right?

148
00:08:48,483 --> 00:08:50,120
The pillows can't topple over either.

149
00:08:50,121 --> 00:08:51,939
At this rate, I'm not even sure we'll
get to eat the soup and rice.

150
00:08:52,626 --> 00:08:55,415
I'm so hungry.
Don't they ever feed us on this show?

- Why are you all seriously being like this?
- I honestly didn't do anything!

165
00:10:00,413 --> 00:10:02,410
- It's because I'm disappointed for you!
- It really is disappointing.

166
00:10:02,411 --> 00:10:04,969
Go Soo, did we do anything? Did we?

167
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:07,134
They just fell over.

168
00:10:07,135 --> 00:10:11,080
[We'll go with them
just having fallen over...]

169
00:10:11,667 --> 00:10:13,462
- You think Go Soo would lie?
- Of course not.

170
00:10:13,463 --> 00:10:15,010
How disappointing...

171
00:10:15,011 --> 00:10:17,419
I'm going to remember all of this
at the final race.

172
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:20,645
[A red hot Tiger's warning.]

173
00:10:20,646 --> 00:10:22,868
- Go ahead.
- I'm being serious!

174
00:10:22,869 --> 00:10:25,802
I'm serious. I'm going to make sure that
you're gone for most of this week's show!

175
00:10:25,803 --> 00:10:27,800
- Fine.
- You saw what happened to Kwang Soo, right?

176
00:10:28,802 --> 00:10:33,143
Let's see... let's see an episode of
Running Man without Yoo Jae Suk.

177
00:10:34,094 --> 00:10:37,679
[I'm going to oust every single
one of you!]

178
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:40,716
You really are so hateful...
Everything about you is so hateful.

179
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:43,998
[Can't hear you...]

180
00:10:44,658 --> 00:10:47,196
Challenge.
I'm going to get this done.

181
00:10:47,196 --> 00:10:49,172
[Making sure to shout out 'Challenge' first.]

182
00:10:49,173 --> 00:10:50,761
[Girls get to jump over three pillows.]

183
00:10:53,532 --> 00:10:55,840
[Oh? Did she succeed?]

184
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:57,976
[Blank Ji succeeds!]

185
00:11:00,786 --> 00:11:04,767
[Finally at last... Time to
enjoy the delicious soup and rice.]

186
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:12,290
This is so delicious.

187
00:11:13,034 --> 00:11:14,517
I really want to eat.

188
00:11:15,578 --> 00:11:17,095
This is really delicious, Jae Suk.

189
00:11:17,096 --> 00:11:18,287
The broth is...

190
00:11:18,946 --> 00:11:20,818
[Enough to make your mouth water...]

191
00:11:25,705 --> 00:11:27,460
[Ha Ha's turn at
the seat cushion jump challenge.]

192
00:11:27,461 --> 00:11:28,696
I think I'll get it this time.

193
00:11:28,697 --> 00:11:31,431
I'm going to do this.
I'm seriously going to do this!

194
00:11:31,431 --> 00:11:34,100
One, two...

195
00:11:41,186 --> 00:11:43,117
[Ha Ha succeeds!]

196
00:11:43,118 --> 00:11:44,203
I succeeded!

197
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:47,684
This is it! I did it!

198
00:11:47,685 --> 00:11:49,383
Can I eat now?

199
00:11:50,188 --> 00:11:53,220
[At last, getting to taste the infamous
Bibimbap of Jeon Joo.]

200
00:11:53,221 --> 00:11:54,467
- Hyo Joo!
- Is it good?

201
00:11:55,618 --> 00:11:56,739
Is it good?

202
00:12:01,278 --> 00:12:04,556
[I'm hungry. That delicious dish...]

203
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,988
[Huh? Where's Hyo Joo going?]

204
00:12:08,989 --> 00:12:10,216
Move!

205
00:12:11,976 --> 00:12:14,797
[Suddenly climbing on
top of the seat cushions.]

206
00:12:14,798 --> 00:12:17,483
- Endure it. Calm down... calm down.
- Move out of the way.

207
00:12:17,484 --> 00:12:20,221
- Calm down.
- I said, I got it!

208
00:12:20,222 --> 00:12:21,780
What are you doing?

209
00:12:24,865 --> 00:12:27,167
[Fail...]

210
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:31,480
[Hyo Joo falling into despair.]

211
00:12:32,342 --> 00:12:33,739
This is seriously so delicious!

212
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:35,357
This is like a work of art.

213
00:12:37,928 --> 00:12:39,159
Everything is so good.

214
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:49,308
[I know I can finish a whole bowl
in a flash right now...]

215
00:12:55,871 --> 00:12:58,968
- That looks really good.
- It really is.

216
00:12:58,968 --> 00:13:00,615
This is almost too much.

217
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:02,629
Come here.

218
00:13:03,446 --> 00:13:05,036
It's okay.
You can eat it too once you succeed.

219
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,884
[Sneaking in again.]

220
00:13:12,885 --> 00:13:14,833
What are you doing now?

221
00:13:14,834 --> 00:13:18,509
Hyo Joo... when do I get my turn?
I'm hungry too!

222
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:22,862
[Her eyes are only set on
succeeding the mission...]

223
00:13:23,756 --> 00:13:25,540
She's very greedy.

224
00:13:34,874 --> 00:13:37,025
[Success!]

225
00:13:38,029 --> 00:13:41,014
[Succeeds through sheer tenacity.]

226
00:13:41,972 --> 00:13:44,701
[You just wait, Bibimbap...]

227
00:13:48,437 --> 00:13:49,944
I was starving!

228
00:13:49,945 --> 00:13:51,218
Thank you!

229
00:13:51,219 --> 00:13:53,470
But isn't it cheating since she
went out of turn?

230
00:13:53,471 --> 00:13:55,276
[Is it cheating because she was
out of turn?]

231
00:13:55,277 --> 00:13:57,086
There's an order we have to follow?

232
00:13:58,242 --> 00:14:06,183
[That's how tenacious Hyo Joo...
finally got her Bibimbap.]

233
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:10,461
[Ha Ha's on his way to the next
mission after finishing his meal.]

234
00:14:15,613 --> 00:14:19,344
[But first, he has to write one portion
of the word, 'King'.]

235
00:14:20,239 --> 00:14:22,909
[The next selection is...]

236
00:14:22,909 --> 00:14:29,202
[Family style Korean meal vs.
a formal style Korean meal.]

237
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:31,478
[Ha Ha chooses
the family style Korean meal.]

238
00:14:31,479 --> 00:14:33,872
[Family style Korean meal vs.
a formal style Korean meal.]

239
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:35,229
I'm going to choose the formal style.

240
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:36,259
[Formal style for Blank Ji.]

241
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:37,877
Family style.

242
00:14:44,529 --> 00:14:46,001
Here it is, here it is!

243
00:14:46,002 --> 00:14:47,777
[Ha Ha is the first to arrive
at the family style restaurant.]

244
00:14:51,876 --> 00:14:52,928
No one else is here?

245
00:14:52,929 --> 00:14:54,389
Have a seat, please.

246
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:56,707
How can this be?
Did someone already come by and leave?

247
00:14:56,708 --> 00:14:58,930
- No, you're the first.
- I'm the first one here?

248
00:14:59,722 --> 00:15:02,775
- What place am I at right now?
- Right now, you're the King.

249
00:15:02,775 --> 00:15:03,849
King!

250
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:08,168
[If I can keep this up,
then I'll be the King....]

251
00:15:16,518 --> 00:15:18,085
- I'll explain the mission to you.
- Yes!

252
00:15:18,086 --> 00:15:22,585
<i>Jeon Joo shows how bountiful
a family style meal can be.</i>

253
00:15:23,592 --> 00:15:27,918
[District of Jeon Joo is famous for
the bountiful family style meal it serves.]

254
00:15:27,918 --> 00:15:33,500
[He'll be given orders on what to choose
out of the family style meal table.]

255
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:37,688
[And if you succeed 10 in a row,
you succeed the mission.]

256
00:15:37,689 --> 00:15:40,391
Wow... you guys are good at
coming up with these games.

257
00:15:41,183 --> 00:15:43,751
[The things we do for a living...]

258
00:15:46,208 --> 00:15:48,904
[Ha Ha's challenge.]

259
00:15:48,905 --> 00:15:51,779
<i>Set... go!
Lift up the Fern Bracken.</i>

260
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:52,986
[One. Fern Bracken.]

261
00:15:54,926 --> 00:15:57,844
[Fern Bracken?]

262
00:15:58,582 --> 00:16:01,432
[Fails right away from looking around.]

263
00:16:05,268 --> 00:16:07,310
What... what is this?

264
00:16:07,311 --> 00:16:08,888
What is this?

265
00:16:09,437 --> 00:16:12,212
[I'm over here.]

266
00:16:12,213 --> 00:16:14,357
- Ha Ha!
- Hyo Joo, you're here.

267
00:16:14,358 --> 00:16:15,465
[A little less hungry Hyo Joo also arrives.]

268
00:16:15,466 --> 00:16:16,963
I'm telling you right now,
this isn't easy.

269
00:16:16,964 --> 00:16:18,429
If you see what you have to do,
you're going to be shocked.

270
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:20,079
- You haven't eaten yet?
- No.

271
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,054
There's no way to eat this.

272
00:16:24,186 --> 00:16:25,397
Hey, hey, hey!

273
00:16:25,807 --> 00:16:28,257
[Dreaming of revenge from last week?]

274
00:16:29,362 --> 00:16:31,234
<i>Set... go.
Eat the bread.</i>

275
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:33,356
<i>Eat the rice.</i>

276
00:16:33,357 --> 00:16:35,082
<i>Don't drink the water,
but lift up the poached pork.</i>

277
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:37,285
[Don't drink the water,
but lift up the poached pork.]

278
00:16:37,286 --> 00:16:39,525
<i>Wrap the pork in napa cabbage
and eat it.</i>

279
00:16:41,627 --> 00:16:43,368
<i>Wrap the pork in napa cabbage
and eat it.</i>

280
00:16:49,977 --> 00:16:51,563
What is this?

281
00:16:52,025 --> 00:16:54,515
You really are coming up with
all sorts of games now!

282
00:16:55,725 --> 00:16:56,955
Come on in.

283
00:16:56,956 --> 00:17:00,035
[Leisure Go-vid also enters the room.]

284
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:02,939
Hyo Joo! And Go Soo...

285
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:07,379
- So he came after all.
- That soup and rice was unbelievable!

286
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:09,649
That Bibimbap was out of this world!

287
00:17:11,623 --> 00:17:14,013
- Everyone's here.
- What's the mission here?

288
00:17:14,014 --> 00:17:15,443
Look! It's bread!

289
00:17:15,444 --> 00:17:17,645
<i>Okay, it's Han Hyo Joo's turn.</i>

290
00:17:17,646 --> 00:17:18,671
<i>Set, go!</i>

291
00:17:18,672 --> 00:17:20,812
<i>Debone a piece of croaker
and eat it.</i>

292
00:17:20,813 --> 00:17:23,924
[Debone a piece of croaker and eat it.]

293
00:17:23,925 --> 00:17:26,223
<i>Debone a piece of croaker
and eat it.</i>

294
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:29,653
[Fail...]

295
00:17:29,654 --> 00:17:32,678
Come on...
Debone a piece of croaker and eat it?

296
00:17:32,679 --> 00:17:34,535
You should've already had it
deboned for us.

297
00:17:34,536 --> 00:17:38,239
- You're being really cruel now.
- Don't you think that you're being too much?

298
00:17:39,724 --> 00:17:41,886
Hyo Joo, out.
Get in there, Go Soo.

299
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:43,941
Move over, Ha Ha.

300
00:17:43,942 --> 00:17:45,758
I'll move over, Jae Suk, scoot up.

301
00:17:45,759 --> 00:17:50,217
- Ha Ha, live happily in your marriage.
- Jae Suk, have a second baby.

302
00:17:50,218 --> 00:17:51,876
Go Soo, be happy.

303
00:17:52,732 --> 00:17:54,955
[Leisure Go-vid's challenge.]

304
00:17:58,327 --> 00:18:03,445
[Slowly and leisurely taking a look
at all the side dishes.]

305
00:18:05,411 --> 00:18:06,466
What is this?

306
00:18:06,467 --> 00:18:08,471
<i>Go Soo, can we start now?</i>

307
00:18:08,472 --> 00:18:09,990
Poached pork. Yes.

308
00:18:11,578 --> 00:18:15,201
- He's like a slow and serious airhead.
- He's worse than Gary.

309
00:18:15,202 --> 00:18:17,582
He takes his time with everything.

310
00:18:19,644 --> 00:18:21,779
[Finally finished getting ready?]

311
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:24,043
He's just slow, but he pretends he's just
being relaxed about things.

312
00:18:24,044 --> 00:18:27,853
- He's totally slow about everything...
- It's like a slow motion video.

313
00:18:27,854 --> 00:18:29,004
<i>Here we go.</i>

314
00:18:30,796 --> 00:18:33,138
[Re-adjusting his position before
getting started.]

315
00:18:37,571 --> 00:18:39,953
He's taking so long getting ready!

316
00:18:40,723 --> 00:18:43,012
- He's really slow.
- He's totally slow!

317
00:18:43,013 --> 00:18:45,026
He's like a turtle. Go-rtle.

318
00:18:45,027 --> 00:18:47,025
Go-rtle...

319
00:18:47,026 --> 00:18:48,642
<i>Eat the rice.</i>

320
00:18:48,642 --> 00:18:52,070
[One. Eat the rice.]

321
00:18:54,193 --> 00:19:00,111
[You should've had the lid off...]

322
00:19:01,527 --> 00:19:03,917
[A slow Go-rtle.]

323
00:19:03,918 --> 00:19:07,811
- Go-rtle... he really is a Go-rtle.
- Go-rtle!

324
00:19:07,812 --> 00:19:11,647
-Go-rtle!
- I'm Go-rtle's fan.

325
00:19:11,648 --> 00:19:13,454
- Me too.
- He's an air-headed Go-rtle.

326
00:19:13,507 --> 00:19:16,310
[Go-rtle, Go Soo. Making others
laugh with any fast movements.]

327
00:19:16,855 --> 00:19:18,581
[This is a formal Korean style restaurant.]

328
00:19:19,885 --> 00:19:22,365
[Gary and Ji Hyo both arrive
almost at the same time.]

329
00:19:22,366 --> 00:19:24,954
No, I was the first to pull up
to the door.

330
00:19:25,879 --> 00:19:31,916
[If you eat the delicious dishes and avoid the
ones with the hot peppers, you succeed!]

331
00:19:32,762 --> 00:19:36,380
[Formal Korean meal bursting with
flavors and beauty of the cuisine.]

332
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:38,164
[Hot pepper is hidden among
these dishes...]

333
00:19:38,165 --> 00:19:40,821
- This is good, Song Ji Hyo!
- This is good. Glad I ran into you!

334
00:19:40,821 --> 00:19:43,009
- I'm good at eating spicy foods.
- I'm good at eating them as well!

335
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:44,688
[The two with confidence at being
able to handle spicy foods.]

336
00:19:45,231 --> 00:19:48,549
Hello.
[The Giraffe also rushes in there.]

337
00:19:48,549 --> 00:19:50,481
- How did you get here so fast?
- Formal Korean meal!

338
00:19:50,482 --> 00:19:53,421
<i>Since you're all here,
I'll explain it to you all at once.</i>

339
00:19:53,422 --> 00:19:54,591
[Mission explanation]

340
00:19:54,592 --> 00:19:56,978
<i>You know what a taste tester is,
correct?</i>

341
00:19:56,979 --> 00:20:00,584
- Taste tester...
- Is it a name for someone?

342
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:08,418
[Taste Tester: Person to taste the food
before a King to check for poison.]

343
00:20:08,419 --> 00:20:10,492
So it's a woman who tests the
food for poison?

344
00:20:10,493 --> 00:20:16,752
<i>On the table before you are 37 different
delicious formal Korean dishes.</i>

345
00:20:16,753 --> 00:20:23,289
<i>Of these dishes, there are some that has
slightly spicy peppers mixed into it.</i>

346
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:24,763
[There are some slightly spicy dishes
mixed into the lot.]

347
00:20:24,764 --> 00:20:28,556
[If you can't handle the spicy food after
eating it, then you're disqualified.]

348
00:20:29,744 --> 00:20:33,775
[Stay alive by avoiding these spicy dishes!]

349
00:20:33,776 --> 00:20:38,039
<i>You will go in order of your arrival,
and we will start the game.</i>

350
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:40,303
I have to finish this quickly
to get to the next destination.

351
00:20:42,289 --> 00:20:51,993
[Just which out of these delicious dishes
are the spicy peppers mixed up in?]

352
00:20:54,847 --> 00:21:01,980
I'm going to start off by eating a pancake
which is one of the representation of Korea.

353
00:21:01,981 --> 00:21:04,563
- Pancakes... those are good.
- Starting off with pancakes.

354
00:21:04,564 --> 00:21:06,335
[Gary selects a pancake.]

355
00:21:06,336 --> 00:21:08,171
There's really nothing
they can do to pancakes.

356
00:21:08,172 --> 00:21:10,856
I'm going to take a bite of
pumpkin pancake which resembles Ji Hyo.

357
00:21:13,371 --> 00:21:17,227
[The taste is...]

358
00:21:17,228 --> 00:21:19,183
Mm... good!

359
00:21:20,415 --> 00:21:22,316
[Gary luckily avoids the spicy dish!]

360
00:21:22,316 --> 00:21:24,243
Then I...

361
00:21:24,244 --> 00:21:26,148
I'm going to choose the sushi.

362
00:21:26,149 --> 00:21:28,167
[Ji Hyo's selection is sushi.]

363
00:21:28,168 --> 00:21:32,464
I will eat the flatfish sushi
which resembles Kang Gary.

364
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:36,231
Why aren't you dipping it in the sauce?

365
00:21:36,232 --> 00:21:38,323
Everyone has a different preference.

366
00:21:38,324 --> 00:21:41,091
Are you two just going to keep talking amongst
yourselves? I shouldn't have come here.

367
00:21:41,092 --> 00:21:43,553
Taste tester Lee, you can wait outside.

368
00:21:43,554 --> 00:21:45,234
Where would I go?

369
00:21:45,656 --> 00:21:47,447
Lee Kwang Soo, Gary!

370
00:21:47,448 --> 00:21:49,397
- It's Jong Kook.
- Ugh, Song Ji Hyo...

371
00:21:51,779 --> 00:21:53,615
I'm going to try the porridge.

372
00:21:53,616 --> 00:21:55,692
[Gary's turn once again.]

373
00:21:56,577 --> 00:22:01,266
[Vegetable porridge
full of the spicy peppers!]

374
00:22:13,484 --> 00:22:14,961
This is delicious.

375
00:22:15,769 --> 00:22:17,212
[Is it in there?]

376
00:22:17,213 --> 00:22:19,808
This porridge tastes better than
the pancake.

377
00:22:19,809 --> 00:22:23,058
[His chatter becomes almost nonexistent.]

378
00:22:23,059 --> 00:22:25,383
- Gary, you don't have to keep eating!
- The smell! I can smell it!

379
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:30,790
Do I have to eat all of it?

380
00:22:30,791 --> 00:22:33,396
I can smell the spicy peppers!

381
00:22:33,397 --> 00:22:35,868
- Then I shall finish it.
- Your lips are purple right now!

382
00:22:35,869 --> 00:22:38,240
I put on some extra makeup today.

383
00:22:40,275 --> 00:22:43,672
- What is that smell?
- Isn't what I ate enough?

384
00:22:45,359 --> 00:22:47,030
Can I try a bite?

385
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:49,758
- Is it okay for me to give him some?
- If he wants it, yes.

386
00:22:49,759 --> 00:22:51,537
Here, try it.

387
00:22:57,125 --> 00:22:58,703
What's wrong?

388
00:22:58,704 --> 00:23:01,354
Is there something spicy in this dish?

389
00:23:01,355 --> 00:23:03,370
How did you eat this?

390
00:23:03,371 --> 00:23:06,125
This isn't right.
It's not right that he ate that much.

391
00:23:06,126 --> 00:23:07,270
[Eyes tearing up?]

392
00:23:08,222 --> 00:23:10,016
- I'm not crying.
- Did he endure it?

393
00:23:10,017 --> 00:23:11,883
What do you mean, endure it?
I thoroughly enjoyed the dish.

394
00:23:11,884 --> 00:23:14,357
He passed when his eyes are
tearing up like they are?

395
00:23:15,306 --> 00:23:18,472
[This guy... he sure does surprise us
with his skills sometimes...]

396
00:23:18,473 --> 00:23:21,232
- Okay, he passes.
- Yeah, we have to pass him.

397
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:24,199
[Because he endured it, he passes!]

398
00:23:30,439 --> 00:23:32,433
It's pepper porridge. Pepper porridge...

399
00:23:32,434 --> 00:23:34,652
It's totally pepper porridge!

400
00:23:34,653 --> 00:23:37,650
- That was totally pepper porridge.
- That's just unbelievable.

401
00:23:37,651 --> 00:23:39,037
[Being able to endure that...]

402
00:23:39,038 --> 00:23:42,076
[I'm a red hot Mr. Capable
that can withstand any spice...]

403
00:23:42,077 --> 00:23:44,184
<i>Here we go...</i>

404
00:23:44,185 --> 00:23:46,196
It's our leisurely friend's turn.

405
00:23:47,770 --> 00:23:49,392
<i>Set, go!
Eat the bread.</i>

406
00:23:49,393 --> 00:23:51,211
- He failed, he failed.
- He totally failed.

407
00:23:52,088 --> 00:23:55,799
Eat the bread!
[Is success impossible for Go-rtle?]

408
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:58,922
Did you see him?
Eat the bread!

409
00:23:58,923 --> 00:24:01,844
- He's just too slow!
- It's already over for him.

410
00:24:03,792 --> 00:24:06,654
- Go Soo, get out of there.
- When you say, eat the bread, eat it fast?

411
00:24:06,655 --> 00:24:09,085
- Eat it like this?
- Of course.

412
00:24:10,055 --> 00:24:13,397
- You think you can get out of here?
- Is this how I eat it?

413
00:24:14,857 --> 00:24:17,043
- Hyo Joo...
- How did you say you eat it, Hyo Joo?

414
00:24:17,044 --> 00:24:20,532
[A demonstration of
Hyo Joo's quick hand movement.]

415
00:24:20,533 --> 00:24:23,070
That's right!
You need to be fast like that!

416
00:24:23,071 --> 00:24:25,412
- How beautiful!
- How beautiful!

417
00:24:25,413 --> 00:24:26,858
You're so beautiful!

418
00:24:26,859 --> 00:24:28,065
Okay, here I go.

419
00:24:28,066 --> 00:24:30,650
You have to be quick in a game like this.

420
00:24:30,651 --> 00:24:33,103
Watch. He'll be disqualified with the first.
I will swear to that.

421
00:24:33,937 --> 00:24:35,346
- With the very first one.
- Hey!

422
00:24:35,347 --> 00:24:37,550
Watch... watch me do this.

423
00:24:37,551 --> 00:24:40,547
I'm soaking everything up with my eyes.
All the side dishes...

424
00:24:40,548 --> 00:24:43,750
[Soak everything up with his eyes?]
Like this... open them up wide.

425
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:48,614
[In the process of soaking things up
with his eyes.]

426
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:51,420
Mackerel?

427
00:24:51,948 --> 00:24:56,208
[Wait... the mackerel is...]

428
00:24:56,208 --> 00:24:57,868
There's no mackerel on the table.

429
00:24:57,869 --> 00:25:01,206
- I said, it's not up there.
- Why are you mentioning that's not on here?

430
00:25:01,207 --> 00:25:05,031
- You said you soaked everything up?
- Why mention something that's not on here?

431
00:25:05,928 --> 00:25:08,714
Jeon. Myun. Go. Pa.
[Acronym of side dishes in the area.]

432
00:25:08,715 --> 00:25:12,022
He sounds like someone who has
no idea what's going on.

433
00:25:12,023 --> 00:25:13,498
I got it.

434
00:25:14,293 --> 00:25:16,315
Jwa. Bae. Bread. Seaweed.

435
00:25:17,693 --> 00:25:18,972
Jwa. Bae. Bread. Seaweed...

436
00:25:18,973 --> 00:25:21,977
[Let's see just how well you
end up doing...]

437
00:25:23,719 --> 00:25:25,192
Lift up the fern bracken.

438
00:25:25,689 --> 00:25:29,026
[Huh? He's grabbing green laver
next to the fern bracken?]

439
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:31,042
You're out, out.

440
00:25:32,745 --> 00:25:35,501
- Move.
- I thought you soaked everything in.

441
00:25:35,502 --> 00:25:38,114
I thought you were soaking
everything in!

442
00:25:38,115 --> 00:25:40,203
What did you soak in with your eyes?

443
00:25:40,723 --> 00:25:42,573
You think I didn't see that?

444
00:25:43,236 --> 00:25:45,723
- You think I didn't see that, Hyo Joo?
- This is hard.

445
00:25:46,601 --> 00:25:48,799
- Okay, here we go.
- Fighting, Hyo Joo, fighting.

446
00:25:55,548 --> 00:26:00,721
Hyo Joo! Hyo Joo!
Joo! Joo!

447
00:26:05,497 --> 00:26:08,049
<i>Eat salted cuttle fish.
Eat the kimchi.</i>

448
00:26:08,050 --> 00:26:10,586
<i>Eat the salted shrimp.
Eat the anchovy.</i>

449
00:26:10,587 --> 00:26:13,418
- She's actually doing pretty good.
- But I bet it's a little salty for her.

450
00:26:13,419 --> 00:26:15,713
<i>Wrap the pork in kimchi and
give it to Go Soo.</i>

451
00:26:17,953 --> 00:26:19,527
<i>Eat the radish water kimchi.</i>

452
00:26:19,528 --> 00:26:21,659
<i>Wrap the anchovy in
napa cabbage and eat it.</i>

453
00:26:23,518 --> 00:26:25,605
Anchovy wrapped in napa
cabbage is a little...

454
00:26:26,396 --> 00:26:27,698
<i>Drink some water.</i>

455
00:26:28,177 --> 00:26:29,584
<i>Eat the bread.</i>

456
00:26:32,666 --> 00:26:34,546
But that was way too slow.

457
00:26:34,547 --> 00:26:37,084
[Success]

458
00:26:38,468 --> 00:26:41,874
- Eating like that is really...
- Success!

459
00:26:41,875 --> 00:26:45,000
- Hyo Joo, we'll see you later.
- Okay, see you later!

460
00:26:47,813 --> 00:26:53,134
[Hyo Joo wins the write to write
the second portion for the word, 'King'.]

461
00:26:53,135 --> 00:26:55,000
That turned out well.

462
00:26:55,001 --> 00:26:57,761
[Jeon Joo's Omogari Soup or
Jeon Joo's beef rib soup.]

463
00:26:57,762 --> 00:26:59,048
Beef rib soup.

464
00:26:59,049 --> 00:27:02,590
[Heading off to the rib soup restaurant.]

465
00:27:04,692 --> 00:27:07,372
[And over at the formal dining restaurant,
Ji Hyo and Kwang Soo fails their mission.]

466
00:27:07,372 --> 00:27:10,289
[The competition is now between
Jong Kook and Gary.]

467
00:27:10,290 --> 00:27:11,726
Okay, go ahead.

468
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:14,249
<i>You have to eat all of it.</i>

469
00:27:21,739 --> 00:27:25,098
[Blinking his eyes rapidly.]

470
00:27:25,099 --> 00:27:27,147
Why are you doing that with
your eyes?

471
00:27:27,148 --> 00:27:30,536
- Look at your eyes!
- Why? What's wrong with them?

472
00:27:30,537 --> 00:27:34,792
Seriously though... you blinked
like five times within one second!

473
00:27:34,793 --> 00:27:37,549
- Really?
- Why are you taking your coat off?

474
00:27:37,831 --> 00:27:41,666
[Why is he getting angry all of a sudden?
Or is he just getting hot?]

475
00:27:41,667 --> 00:27:43,950
- What did you just say?
- No, that's not what I meant...

476
00:27:43,951 --> 00:27:45,782
You have to eat the rest of it.

477
00:27:50,161 --> 00:27:52,484
His eyes got this big all of a sudden.

478
00:27:52,485 --> 00:27:55,810
- Hurry up and eat the rest of it.
- Jong Kook, just come over here.

479
00:28:00,257 --> 00:28:02,920
[Starting the hiccups?]

480
00:28:02,921 --> 00:28:05,701
He's hiccuping... I think it's
because the food's too spicy for you.

481
00:28:05,702 --> 00:28:07,709
- No, no...
- It's because it's so delicious, right?

482
00:28:08,144 --> 00:28:11,314
Shouldn't he have failed by now
with all that?

483
00:28:12,204 --> 00:28:14,131
Look, he's hiccuping!

484
00:28:18,858 --> 00:28:20,429
Jong Kook, come over here.

485
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:22,820
He's scratching up his chest!

486
00:28:24,429 --> 00:28:26,827
[Jong Kook gives up and fails the mission.]
I've found Jong Kook's weakness now.

487
00:28:27,341 --> 00:28:29,938
I should carry some hot pepper flakes
around with me and throw it at him.

488
00:28:29,939 --> 00:28:32,627
What are you doing?
He's eating weird stuff over here.

489
00:28:32,628 --> 00:28:36,207
[Uh... that's not for eating...]

490
00:28:44,746 --> 00:28:47,568
[Hyo Joo arriving at her next location.]

491
00:28:49,772 --> 00:28:51,711
Hello. I'm the only one here?

492
00:28:54,827 --> 00:28:57,472
[Hot and steamy bowl of beef rib soup.]

493
00:28:58,778 --> 00:29:04,668
<i>[If you can split up three pieces of firewood,
then you succeed. One for women.]</i>

494

[If she can split up one piece of firewood
out in the front lawn, then she succeeds!]

495
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,881
I'm the King right now?

496
00:29:12,882 --> 00:29:14,413
That's so great!

497
00:29:17,378 --> 00:29:19,616
[However, this mission
doesn't seems so easy...]

498
00:29:26,254 --> 00:29:27,362
Hi.

499
00:29:27,363 --> 00:29:29,371
I have to cut up this firewood right now.

500
00:29:31,187 --> 00:29:33,383
[Let's play together some other time.]

501
00:29:38,819 --> 00:29:41,735
[Even with a strong blow, there's
no damage done to the firewood.]

502
00:29:41,736 --> 00:29:43,787
Do we only get one chance with this?

503
00:29:43,788 --> 00:29:45,121
<i>No, you can do it again.</i>

504
00:29:46,166 --> 00:29:47,692
This isn't really working.

505
00:29:49,130 --> 00:29:50,352
This is the place.

506
00:29:52,644 --> 00:29:54,101
Hello.

507
00:29:56,906 --> 00:29:58,590
- Hello.
- Hello.

508
00:29:59,625 --> 00:30:02,124
By any chance, do you know how
to split up firewood?

509
00:30:02,125 --> 00:30:03,993
Easy way to split up firewood?

510
00:30:03,994 --> 00:30:05,875
Hello, yes, hello.

511
00:30:05,876 --> 00:30:08,859
- Hyo Joo, what are you doing?
- I'm splitting up firewood.

512
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:11,413
- So you're already doing the mission?
- If you're trying to split up firewood...

513
00:30:12,798 --> 00:30:14,916
You have to follow the grain of the wood.

514
00:30:14,917 --> 00:30:18,987
[If you want to split up firewood,
follow the grain of the wood.]

515
00:30:18,988 --> 00:30:21,478
If you follow the wood and hit it hard,
you'll have it split with one blow.

516
00:30:21,479 --> 00:30:25,730
- If you don't, then it'll never work.
- Thank you, Elder.

517
00:30:25,731 --> 00:30:27,861
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Sir.

518
00:30:27,862 --> 00:30:29,738
Goodbye, Sir.

519
00:30:29,739 --> 00:30:33,046
Three... I have to split up three
to succeed?

520
00:30:34,563 --> 00:30:35,848
I can do it.

521
00:30:35,849 --> 00:30:37,276
Challenge!

522
00:30:48,086 --> 00:30:51,076
[That's right... Follow the grain...]

523
00:30:51,077 --> 00:30:54,569
Ugh... that was a good try!

524
00:30:57,271 --> 00:30:59,182
Look! It did split!

525
00:31:02,491 --> 00:31:03,826
Challenge!

526
00:31:05,632 --> 00:31:07,853
It seems like the perfect weather
to be splitting up firewood.

527
00:31:10,006 --> 00:31:11,660
What made you think of that
all of a sudden?

528
00:31:11,661 --> 00:31:15,023
I thought of it while staring
up at the blue sky.

529
00:31:15,024 --> 00:31:17,006
- It's beautiful.
- It's beautiful.

530
00:31:17,007 --> 00:31:19,174
- Hyo Joo, get move a little.
- Okay.

531
00:31:19,175 --> 00:31:22,188
Just like the elder told us,
I'm going to follow the grain.

532
00:31:22,189 --> 00:31:23,932
[Planning on striking just as
the elder taught him to do.]

533
00:31:23,933 --> 00:31:25,856
<i>You have to follow the grain
of the wood.</i>

534
00:31:25,857 --> 00:31:30,494
['In order to split up firewood, you
have to follow the grain of the wood.']

535
00:31:31,557 --> 00:31:33,972
<i>- If you follow it, you'll get it in one shot.
- I see.</i>

536
00:31:39,224 --> 00:31:41,394
[One clean shot!]
That's unbelievable!

537
00:31:43,069 --> 00:31:44,000
Challenge!

538
00:31:45,126 --> 00:31:47,191
[Two in a row!]

539
00:31:51,236 --> 00:31:52,331
Challenge!

540
00:31:52,332 --> 00:31:54,231
[If he can do one more,
then he passes the mission.]

541
00:31:57,079 --> 00:32:00,438
[Will he be able to do it with one strike?]

542
00:32:06,983 --> 00:32:09,214
[Splitting up firewood
is definitely my game...]

543
00:32:14,052 --> 00:32:15,082
I did it.

544
00:32:15,083 --> 00:32:18,802
- This is the perfect game for Kim Jong Kook.
- Jong Kook, when did you get here?

545
00:32:18,803 --> 00:32:20,488
Hyo Joo, one shot. Just follow the grain.

546
00:32:20,489 --> 00:32:22,383
- Challenge.
- Challenge.

547
00:32:28,141 --> 00:32:31,167
That piece of wood is too sturdy...
Let me see it. I think it's too sturdy.

548
00:32:31,168 --> 00:32:33,030
I'm sure this must be hard.

549
00:32:34,014 --> 00:32:37,246
[It's hard, you said?]

550
00:32:39,204 --> 00:32:41,498
- Why is that hard for you?
- No, it is hard.

551
00:32:41,499 --> 00:32:45,051
I shouldn't have come here.
I should've chose the other soup.

552
00:32:45,052 --> 00:32:47,065
[I shouldn't have come here...]

553
00:32:56,932 --> 00:33:00,315
It would be so nice if I could just close
my eyes for five to ten minutes.

554
00:33:02,214 --> 00:33:05,592
[Ah... so sleepy...]

555
00:33:06,616 --> 00:33:11,201
[I wonder if I can close my eyes
for a few minutes...]

556
00:33:12,175 --> 00:33:14,674
[Ultimately...]

557
00:33:15,867 --> 00:33:19,488
[Go-rtle reclining the seat back
and laying down to get some rest.]

558
00:33:25,756 --> 00:33:27,955
I'm just going to take a nap
for five to ten minutes.

559
00:33:29,987 --> 00:33:33,413
[He really did fall asleep
for five minutes...]

560
00:33:33,414 --> 00:33:34,889
- Here he comes.
- Who is it?

561
00:33:34,890 --> 00:33:37,301
- Isn't that Go-rtle?
- Yeah, I think it's Go-rtle.

562
00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:40,246
[Much livelier than earlier?]

563
00:33:41,369 --> 00:33:44,661
- Look at the way he's walking.
- He's just walking here instead of running.

564
00:33:44,662 --> 00:33:46,880
- He doesn't run.
- When did you get here?

565
00:33:46,881 --> 00:33:48,976
Why are you getting here so late
when you took off before us?

566
00:33:48,977 --> 00:33:51,880
People these days are
too quick with everything.

567
00:33:52,389 --> 00:33:54,208
They're too quick.

568
00:33:54,209 --> 00:33:55,536
[Go-rtle having a tough time with
this fast paced world.]

569
00:33:55,537 --> 00:33:58,021
- Suk Jin...
- Kwang Soo, finally we get to see you.

570
00:33:58,022 --> 00:34:01,090
- Yes, Suk Jin.
- Are you good at breaking things like this?

571
00:34:01,091 --> 00:34:03,385
- What?
- Is it brick breaking?

572
00:34:03,386 --> 00:34:05,494
[Breaking bricks at this location?]

573
00:34:05,495 --> 00:34:07,052
- Brick breaking?
- I've never done it before.

574

<i>This restaurant is an Omogari soup place.
In Jeon Joo dialect, it means clay pot.</i>

575

<i>The game we've prepared in the spirit of the
clay pot and the earthenware of the soup...</i>

576
00:34:16,081 --> 00:34:19,046
- What does that mean?
- It means, gain strength from the soup.

577
00:34:19,918 --> 00:34:22,585
Anyways... that sunshine really
feels great.

578
00:34:24,341 --> 00:34:26,529
[His ease of being able to
enjoy the sunshine.]

579
00:34:26,530 --> 00:34:28,743
Anyways, that sunshine really
feels great.

580
00:34:28,744 --> 00:34:31,434
- See how much ease he has?
- He's really relaxed.

581
00:34:31,435 --> 00:34:34,790
All of us have to try to break the bricks
and become the King so we can get going.

582
00:34:34,791 --> 00:34:37,156
- Oh! It's Ji Hyo!
- It's Ji Hyo!

583

<i>Look at her happy expression after
having seeing the brick breaking.</i>

584

How many bricks do the women
have to break?

585
00:34:42,090 --> 00:34:44,808
<i>12 bricks for men,
and eight for women.</i>

586
00:34:44,809 --> 00:34:47,427
- But Ji Hyo's not...
- Ji Hyo's no girl though.

587

[Big-nosed Brother taking his turn first.]

588
00:34:51,553 --> 00:34:53,989
This feels a little off.
Should I do it this way?

589
00:34:53,990 --> 00:34:56,996
[Taking so long to get ready...]

590
00:34:56,997 --> 00:34:59,525
- What are you doing?
- Suk Jin, this is how you do it.

591
00:34:59,526 --> 00:35:02,005
Hold your fist like this,
and bring it down like this.

592
00:35:02,726 --> 00:35:04,794
- Don't you even know that?
- Ji Hyo has to teach you that?

593
00:35:04,795 --> 00:35:07,530
- Fine, you're better than me, okay?
- Just bring it down like this.

594
00:35:07,531 --> 00:35:11,062
- You're taking way too long.
- But this is my way of doing it.

595
00:35:11,063 --> 00:35:13,542
You can do this... you can do this!

596
00:35:18,027 --> 00:35:21,071
[Eight bricks. Fail...]

597
00:35:24,331 --> 00:35:26,089
I'll be on my way first, okay?

598
00:35:26,756 --> 00:35:29,704
Go-rtle is being way too confident right now.
He's saying he'll be on his way first.

599
00:35:29,705 --> 00:35:33,113
If he gets it with one blow,
then he'll be King right now.

600
00:35:33,114 --> 00:35:35,734
- If you get it, then you'll be King.
- Really?

601
00:35:37,690 --> 00:35:39,125
Okay, here I go. Challenge.

602
00:35:41,047 --> 00:35:42,651
If you can get it in one blow,
it'll be really cool.

603
00:35:42,652 --> 00:35:44,793
- Is this your first attempt?
- Yeah, this is my first.

604
00:35:44,794 --> 00:35:47,474
Fighting...

605
00:35:48,744 --> 00:35:51,967
[Even the cheering is Go-rtle style.]

606
00:35:53,337 --> 00:35:55,703
[Okay... let's get on with this mission...]

607
00:35:55,704 --> 00:35:58,008

one blow as he's guaranteed?]

[Barely breaks six...]

- One, two, three, four, five, six.
- You did worse than Suk Jin!

611
00:36:08,359 --> 00:36:12,006
- Only six!
- This guy really is a klutz!

612
00:36:12,007 --> 00:36:14,446
What was it that you said?
'I'll be on my way first'.

613
00:36:14,447 --> 00:36:17,189
- I'm sorry...
- That was like an air punch.

614
00:36:18,661 --> 00:36:21,265
- Where did the fierce Go Soo go to?
- Are you sure you're Go Soo?

615

Wait, you think you can do it?

616
00:36:23,897 --> 00:36:26,493
Just worry about yourself!

617
00:36:26,494 --> 00:36:29,059
- This seems a bit tough for you...
- I bet she can do it.

618
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:31,514
- Ji Hyo...
- You have to break eight, okay?

619
00:36:31,515 --> 00:36:34,527
- Eight.
- Let's see how good you are.

620
00:36:34,528 --> 00:36:35,648

621
00:36:35,683 --> 00:36:37,107

[I hope she's careful...]

623
00:36:42,267 --> 00:36:45,544

What the heck are you?

629
00:37:15,063 --> 00:37:17,824
- Did she pass?
- I'm telling you, she's not a girl.

630
00:37:17,824 --> 00:37:20,667
- She has to be made to break 12 like us.
- I really don't know I broke them all.

[Ultimate humiliation for the men...]

[Blank Ji's brick breaking lessons.]

with your arms extended like this.

[Professor Blank kindly explaining
the method to her disciples.]

636

- Held out straight. Don't bend.
- Don't bend the arm?

637
00:37:35,229 --> 00:37:38,410
Just in that position,
strike it down like this.

638

[While he was worried about her earlier,
now he's learning from her.]

639
00:37:42,605 --> 00:37:44,996
It's okay with us, so let
Go Soo break just eight bricks.

640
00:37:47,272 --> 00:37:48,745
No, don't do eight.
Let's just give him seven.

641

- Are you enjoying your meal?
- Yes, I am.

642

[And in the firewood splitting place...]

643

[Gary's turn at the challenge.]

645

Hyo Joo, stay behind.
Something can fly your way.

647

Stay behind, okay?

648
00:38:14,387 --> 00:38:17,533
- It's easier than I thought.
- There's no need to strike it really hard.

649
00:38:17,534 --> 00:38:18,954
- Yes, you're right!
- See?

650

Entrusting my pride and honor
to the firewood...

651

Kang Gary, succeeds!]

659
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,440
- Let's go eat!
- Gary's done.

660
00:38:54,223 --> 00:38:57,209
[I definitely should've picked
the other soup...]

661
00:38:58,724 --> 00:39:01,022
Hyo Joo, you have to utilize
the weight of the ax.

662
00:39:01,023 --> 00:39:03,036
Slam down on it with the
weight of the ax.

663
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:07,370
[Trust the power of the ax...]

664
00:39:07,370 --> 00:39:09,525
[And follow the grain!]

665
00:39:10,068 --> 00:39:11,458
That's right!

666
00:39:11,459 --> 00:39:14,550
- That's right!
- You did it!

667
00:39:14,551 --> 00:39:15,988
- You did it.
- You did it!

668
00:39:17,055 --> 00:39:18,676
Hyo Joo, what are you doing?

669
00:39:18,677 --> 00:39:20,272
Hyo Joo, you did it.

670
00:39:20,273 --> 00:39:22,222
Look at how happy she is.

671
00:39:22,223 --> 00:39:24,476
High five! I knew you could do it!

672
00:39:24,477 --> 00:39:27,531
[Everyone succeeds the third course
of splitting up the firewood!]

673
00:39:28,829 --> 00:39:32,324
[Jae Suk having won the opportunity
to write the third portion to the word, King.]

674
00:39:34,321 --> 00:39:35,470
Where's the next location?

675
00:39:35,470 --> 00:39:36,787
[The final selection is...]

676
00:39:36,788 --> 00:39:38,093
I love these dishes...

677
00:39:38,094 --> 00:39:41,592
[Jeon Joo's thick noodle soup vs.
Jeon Joo's sweet bean thick noodle soup.]

678
00:39:41,593 --> 00:39:43,582
I'm going to choose
the sweet bean noodle soup.

679
00:39:44,318 --> 00:39:45,408
Kwang Soo...

680
00:39:45,443 --> 00:39:48,172
[Kwang Soo's turn to break the bricks.]

681
00:39:49,307 --> 00:39:51,357
Calling on the energy of giraffes!

682
00:39:52,853 --> 00:39:55,163
[Oh my... it's really there.]

683
00:39:55,947 --> 00:39:59,674
[Okay... receive the energy of
the giraffes.]

684
00:40:12,007 --> 00:40:14,103
[Giraffe succeeds.]

685
00:40:14,104 --> 00:40:16,750
- He really did it.
- He did break all of them.

686
00:40:16,751 --> 00:40:18,684
[Is it thanks to the energy
of the giraffes?]

687
00:40:23,723 --> 00:40:28,947
[Thanks, giraffes...]

688
00:40:28,948 --> 00:40:31,534
- I'm so jealous.
- Show me your forms.

689
00:40:31,535 --> 00:40:34,000
- I'll see if your stances are correct or not.
- I thought you only broke 11.

690
00:40:34,001 --> 00:40:35,609
11?

691
00:40:37,589 --> 00:40:39,805
[Jeon Joo's thick noodle soup vs.
Jeon Joo's sweet bean thick noodle soup.]

692
00:40:40,327 --> 00:40:42,148
Jeon Joo's thick noodle soup.

693
00:40:42,149 --> 00:40:43,674
[Professor Blank is heading off to
thick noodle soup.]

694
00:40:45,355 --> 00:40:47,870
[Only Go Soo and
Big-nosed Brother are left.]

695
00:40:48,385 --> 00:40:53,130
I don't like how only the first place winner
gets all the attention here...

696
00:40:53,131 --> 00:40:57,591
- But we still have the next game.
- That's right. This isn't the end of it.

697
00:40:57,592 --> 00:40:59,347
We still have one last game.

698
00:41:00,883 --> 00:41:02,563
Since we still have one more...

699
00:41:02,564 --> 00:41:04,513
Yeah, we still have one more.
Fighting!

700
00:41:09,961 --> 00:41:12,521
[Darn... missed one...]

701
00:41:12,522 --> 00:41:14,229
Wait! It's broken in the back!

702
00:41:14,230 --> 00:41:16,798
- It's broken in the back!
- 12. He succeeded.

703
00:41:16,799 --> 00:41:18,560
[Oh... he succeeded.]

704
00:41:18,561 --> 00:41:20,514
There's a slight fracture in the back.

705
00:41:20,515 --> 00:41:22,797
[Even though it's a slight fracture,
it's still counts as being broken.]

706
00:41:22,798 --> 00:41:25,050
Wow! You actually did it!

707
00:41:26,862 --> 00:41:28,913
It's broken in the back! It's broken!

708
00:41:30,955 --> 00:41:33,972
[Even though he may be slow, he's
still honest about showing enthusiasm.]

709
00:41:36,613 --> 00:41:38,611
It's telling me to go slow.

710
00:41:40,545 --> 00:41:42,713
I don't think any one of them
has any sense of ease.

711
00:41:43,611 --> 00:41:48,345
Everyone is only given one
chance at life...

712
00:41:48,719 --> 00:41:50,604
They need to enjoy life more.

713
00:41:51,149 --> 00:41:53,847
- We don't know who the King is at the moment.
- I'm not the King?

714
00:41:53,848 --> 00:41:56,340
<i>You have a very good chance since
you were the first to arrive here.</i>

715
00:41:56,784 --> 00:42:00,543
<i>This mission is a dish that cannot
be left out in Jeon Joo.</i>

716
00:42:00,544 --> 00:42:02,533
<i>But in this area,
they just call it sweet bean porridge.</i>

717
00:42:02,534 --> 00:42:06,265
- This mission is 'Move the bean'.
- What does that mean?

718
00:42:06,266 --> 00:42:10,499
<i>Do you see the two plates in front of you?
We're going to spill the beans out for you.</i>

719
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:13,500
- Red beans?
- It could be red beans and others too.

720
00:42:14,902 --> 00:42:18,150
<i>And we're going to give
you a folk song...</i>

721
00:42:18,151 --> 00:42:23,315
<i>And while you sing it nice and long
without taking any breaths...</i>

722
00:42:23,316 --> 00:42:26,751
<i>you have to use your chopsticks to move
20 beans onto the plate.</i>

723
00:42:26,752 --> 00:42:29,649
- Please choose a number.
- Lucky number seven!

724
00:42:31,704 --> 00:42:34,107
[Number seven is corn kernels.]

725
00:42:34,108 --> 00:42:36,158
- You have to move 20 kernels.
- Can I do this in on try?

726
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:38,711
- Of course, you can.
- I'm very good with chopsticks.

727
00:42:38,712 --> 00:42:40,110
Of course, you can.

728
00:42:40,111 --> 00:42:42,747
[Kkuk also arrives.]

729
00:42:42,748 --> 00:42:46,304
- Ugh... here he comes again.
- What is this?

730
00:42:46,305 --> 00:42:47,919
Okay, here I go.

731
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:49,055
What are you doing?

732
00:42:55,483 --> 00:42:59,185
[Not being able to grasp onto
any corn kernels.]

733
00:43:02,133 --> 00:43:04,383
I'm not good at things like that.

734
00:43:05,816 --> 00:43:08,692
- I'm not good at things like that.
- This is impossible!

735
00:43:08,693 --> 00:43:11,627
I've been crazing sweet red beans...
What is this now?

736
00:43:12,105 --> 00:43:13,430
<i>Please make your selection.</i>

737
00:43:13,431 --> 00:43:17,195
[Kkuk's selection is... rice.]

738
00:43:17,196 --> 00:43:18,527
Ah, he has to move the rice?

739
00:43:19,732 --> 00:43:21,782
- You think rice is going to be hard?
- 20 pieces of grain.

740
00:43:21,783 --> 00:43:23,971
- Rice is easy.
- Give it a try.

741
00:43:23,972 --> 00:43:26,544
- I'm telling you, rice is easy.
- Give it a try then.

742
00:43:43,173 --> 00:43:44,886
We can't hear you!

743
00:43:44,887 --> 00:43:47,030
- Wait, there was a break!
- There was a break!

744
00:43:47,031 --> 00:43:49,225
- Wait, there was a break!
- There was a break!

745
00:43:49,226 --> 00:43:51,318
[Kkuk fails.]

746
00:43:51,319 --> 00:43:54,308
- Let go.
- It wasn't a break!

747
00:43:54,309 --> 00:43:56,976
- My voice is just a little hoarse!
- No, it was a break.

748
00:43:56,977 --> 00:43:58,664
Didn't you know that my
voice is hoarse?

749
00:44:00,157 --> 00:44:02,307
You're all here?

750
00:44:02,308 --> 00:44:04,710
- You're here.
- Yes, hello.

751
00:44:04,711 --> 00:44:06,140
- Number two!
- Number two?

752
00:44:07,863 --> 00:44:10,113
[Gary chooses barley.]

753
00:44:11,535 --> 00:44:15,237
Gary and barley...

754
00:44:17,715 --> 00:44:21,064
[They need to beat this mission quickly
in order to become King...]

755
00:44:21,065 --> 00:44:22,994
I need to get it close together...

756
00:44:24,777 --> 00:44:24,777
It's too close together.

757
00:44:24,778 --> 00:44:27,204
It's too close. Excuse me.

758
00:44:27,205 --> 00:44:29,882
[Coach Kkuk separating the two plates.]

759
00:44:39,636 --> 00:44:41,484
20 is too hard.

760
00:44:41,485 --> 00:44:45,343
[Tiny little barley grains...]

761
00:44:49,926 --> 00:44:51,310
I can hear your voice wavering a little.

762
00:44:51,786 --> 00:44:53,766
Here it comes... it's here.

763
00:44:53,767 --> 00:44:56,416
[It seems as though the end is near?]

764
00:45:01,737 --> 00:45:04,170
[But Gary still manages to
move over quite a few!]

765
00:45:08,525 --> 00:45:10,876
[All done!]

766
00:45:11,749 --> 00:45:13,734
[Gary fails...]

767
00:45:15,283 --> 00:45:18,624
This is hard... this is too hard!

768
00:45:20,214 --> 00:45:22,882
I can't believe it ended there!

769
00:45:24,769 --> 00:45:27,297
[Fourth course - Noodle soup restaurant.]

770
00:45:27,929 --> 00:45:29,864
[Just like the others,
they're making their selection here too.]

771
00:45:32,013 --> 00:45:35,298
[Ji Hyo chooses a maple leaf.]

772
00:45:35,298 --> 00:45:37,588
[Kwang Soo's selection is a broccoli?]

773
00:45:37,589 --> 00:45:39,728
How can I blow this all the
way over there?

774
00:45:40,141 --> 00:45:41,190
[Place down your selection here.]

775
00:45:41,190 --> 00:45:45,280
[And blow it over with your breathe,
and get it over the line to succeed.]

776
00:45:46,469 --> 00:45:47,470
Challenge.

777
00:45:48,797 --> 00:45:50,282
[Broccoli dreaming of a contingency plan.]

778
00:45:56,546 --> 00:45:58,852
What is this?
What are we doing here?

779
00:46:04,078 --> 00:46:07,503
[Going to grab Myuk PD by his throat...]

780
00:46:09,834 --> 00:46:12,051
That's not it, but how is that possible?

781
00:46:12,310 --> 00:46:16,065
[Unlike Kwang Soo, who's having a
tough time with his poor selection...]

782
00:46:16,066 --> 00:46:18,246
[Awesome... she chose beans!]

783
00:46:18,982 --> 00:46:21,385
[Hyo Joo getting an opportunity to win!]

784
00:46:21,386 --> 00:46:23,757
- But this isn't working.
- You have to let the plate down.

785
00:46:23,758 --> 00:46:25,871
[If you grab onto the plate,
then the plate leans over to the side.]

786
00:46:25,872 --> 00:46:28,479
If you try to grab it with the plate leaning,
then you can't grab onto the beans.

787
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:31,565
- The way I see it...
- That's right. Grab it like that.

788
00:46:31,566 --> 00:46:33,638
[The beans definitely look easier.]

789
00:46:41,727 --> 00:46:44,941
[Her start seems
a little short on the breath?]

790
00:46:49,776 --> 00:46:52,527
- There it is...
- It's already here.

791
00:46:53,942 --> 00:46:56,531
[Fail...]

792
00:46:59,427 --> 00:47:02,521
[Hyo Joo loses her chance
with the beans.]

793
00:47:02,522 --> 00:47:05,079
- What a loss...
- Han Hyo Joo...

794
00:47:11,159 --> 00:47:13,934
[The end?]

795
00:47:15,586 --> 00:47:18,775
- The end! End!
- It's already over...

796
00:47:18,776 --> 00:47:21,681
[Fails faster than anyone else.]

797
00:47:22,665 --> 00:47:24,632
- Let's do this quickly!
- Pick number four.

798
00:47:24,633 --> 00:47:27,904
Number four!
[Kkuk's selection is number four.]

799
00:47:27,905 --> 00:47:30,250
[He chooses jujubes.]

800
00:47:30,251 --> 00:47:32,554
I told you, I can see everything.

801
00:47:33,047 --> 00:47:35,734
To all the students watching this,
I really can see everything.

802
00:47:36,780 --> 00:47:39,000
Even his mentality is so hateful.

803
00:47:41,207 --> 00:47:43,292
He's telling all the student viewers
that he can see everything.

804
00:47:43,293 --> 00:47:47,034
I really can see everything.
If you think you can do it, you can do it.

805
00:47:47,035 --> 00:47:48,375
I'm being serious.

806
00:47:48,376 --> 00:47:50,407
- I'm going to finish this.
- Okay, finish it.

807
00:47:50,408 --> 00:47:51,492
[Kkuk with the chance to win with jujubes.]

808
00:47:51,492 --> 00:47:53,932
I guess I'm going to win.
It looks like I'll be the King.

809
00:47:53,933 --> 00:47:56,031
One mistake, and you're finished.

810
00:47:59,425 --> 00:48:02,447
[Jujube head?]

811
00:48:02,447 --> 00:48:05,423
He said jujube head!
He said jujube head!

812
00:48:06,019 --> 00:48:08,750
[What is a jujube head?]

813
00:48:08,751 --> 00:48:10,169
You heard it, right?

814
00:48:10,170 --> 00:48:13,279
[Mr. Capable's mistake from having
been too over confident.]

815
00:48:15,358 --> 00:48:17,295
All our young viewers,
you saw that, right?

816
00:48:18,094 --> 00:48:20,643
- Trying to be too clever is no good.
- Don't trample on their dreams!

817
00:48:22,477 --> 00:48:25,580
[All our young viewers,
make your own decisions wisely...]

818
00:48:25,581 --> 00:48:27,564
You know the story of
the hare and the turtle, right?

819
00:48:27,565 --> 00:48:31,037
- Don't do it.
- Jujube... jujube head.

820
00:48:32,398 --> 00:48:36,043
[Kkuk ruining his perfect chance at a win.]

821
00:48:36,044 --> 00:48:37,868
- How confident he must've been to say that!
- Jujube head...

822
00:48:38,716 --> 00:48:41,808
Why? He should've said bratty
head instead.

823
00:48:44,583 --> 00:48:47,632
[Giraffe trying to win
the challenge with his broccoli.]

824
00:48:48,230 --> 00:48:50,364
Kwang Soo seems to be getting
smaller in size.

825
00:48:50,365 --> 00:48:53,419
- You really think so?
- I think we're just getting used to his size.

826
00:48:54,992 --> 00:48:57,757
[The broccoli... definitely seems smaller
now than it had before.]

827
00:48:57,757 --> 00:49:01,383
[Earlier... now.]

828
00:49:06,199 --> 00:49:08,524
[Definitely is an herbivore...]

829
00:49:10,012 --> 00:49:12,157
[Anyways, the broccoli is
definitely smaller now.]

830
00:49:13,327 --> 00:49:14,895
No, I think we're just getting
used to the size now.

831
00:49:14,896 --> 00:49:17,138
I wonder if it's because
we're just used to it now?

832
00:49:18,138 --> 00:49:20,721
I feel like I look smaller now too.

833
00:49:20,722 --> 00:49:22,588
[Even Kwang Soo's starts to seem smaller
after getting used to him for a while?]

834
00:49:22,589 --> 00:49:25,882
I thought he was over 2 meters at first.
But you're not, are you?

835
00:49:29,175 --> 00:49:30,460
Challenge!

836
00:49:42,127 --> 00:49:46,120
[No way...]

837
00:49:54,459 --> 00:49:58,433
[He really succeeded...]

838
00:50:07,155 --> 00:50:09,142
[I did it!]

839
00:50:11,385 --> 00:50:14,248
[Giraffe having succeeded at
the broccoli blowing!]

840
00:50:16,136 --> 00:50:17,981
I'd be crying too.
Go ahead and cry.

841
00:50:17,982 --> 00:50:19,253
Cry as much as you want.

842
00:50:19,254 --> 00:50:23,357
[Tears of joy from being
the first one to succeed.]

843
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:29,114
[Tiger mixing up the seeds.]

844
00:50:29,115 --> 00:50:32,576
Look at him right now!
He's being a brat, up to no good.

845
00:50:36,605 --> 00:50:37,782
Number two.

846
00:50:39,936 --> 00:50:41,538
[What is it?]

847
00:50:42,449 --> 00:50:45,498
- I can't believe she picked it!
- Jujube?

848
00:50:48,134 --> 00:50:50,275
Be careful not to say jujube head.

849
00:50:51,196 --> 00:50:54,576
Mugwort head...

850
00:50:55,388 --> 00:50:57,708
- She's not very good with chopsticks.
- She's already too late.

851
00:50:57,709 --> 00:51:00,893
[Her chopstick movements are too slow?]

852
00:51:00,894 --> 00:51:03,496
I guess someone else just got here.

853
00:51:03,901 --> 00:51:06,962
[Her movements are getting
a little quicker?]

854
00:51:07,686 --> 00:51:10,721
- I can hear it. It's here.
- There it is. Hyo Joo...

855
00:51:10,722 --> 00:51:13,135
- This is the toughest part...
- Hyo Joo...

856
00:51:13,136 --> 00:51:14,602
Even though you think you may do it...

857
00:51:14,603 --> 00:51:16,924
[Will she succeed?]

858
00:51:16,925 --> 00:51:19,502
There it is... there it is.

859
00:51:23,682 --> 00:51:27,374
[Oh no! One fell off the plate!]

860
00:51:32,812 --> 00:51:35,548
[Hyo Joo failing at the last
crucial moment!]

861
00:51:35,549 --> 00:51:37,868
- Wait! Wait!
- Hyo Joo, wow!

862
00:51:37,869 --> 00:51:40,304
You really are a fool!

863
00:51:40,305 --> 00:51:41,600
- Why did you do that?
- Wait a minute...

864
00:51:41,601 --> 00:51:48,317
Two, four, six, eight, ten.
Two, four, six, eight, ten.

865
00:51:48,318 --> 00:51:51,039
[What? Hyo Joo had moved 21 pieces!]

866
00:51:52,067 --> 00:51:53,806
- She did...
- Success!

867
00:51:54,564 --> 00:51:57,788
[The goal was 20 and even though she dropped
one, she succeeds from having moved 21.]

868
00:51:58,502 --> 00:52:02,385
[Kwang Soo having earned the right to
finish off the word, 'King'.]

869
00:52:09,497 --> 00:52:12,326
[Am I King?]

870
00:52:14,268 --> 00:52:16,238
I finished first for the first time.

871
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:21,561
[Kwang Soo also heads off
to the final location.]

872
00:52:22,610 --> 00:52:25,282
I won't forgive anyone
who tries to get in my way.

873
00:52:26,237 --> 00:52:30,181
Because today... is D-day.

874
00:52:36,037 --> 00:52:39,094
[Have to be the first one to arrive at the
final location to become the ultimate king!]

875
00:52:39,094 --> 00:52:43,685
[Just which one of the two
will become King?]

876
00:52:44,161 --> 00:52:48,266
[The place where the seat of the king's throne
will be given to the winner, 'J' University!]

877
00:52:48,266 --> 00:52:52,115
[Just who is the first one to arrive?]

878
00:52:56,942 --> 00:52:58,716
[Giraffe! It's the Giraffe!]

879
00:52:58,717 --> 00:53:01,358
What happened? Do I just go in?

880
00:53:01,359 --> 00:53:03,972
[Is Kwang Soo the first one
to have arrived?]

881
00:53:05,808 --> 00:53:08,576
[Thanks to the cooperation of the school,
we were able to film the show safely.]

882
00:53:13,879 --> 00:53:16,221
- Am I first?
- You are...

883
00:53:18,194 --> 00:53:23,166
[You are... King.]

884
00:53:27,058 --> 00:53:31,957
[Hyo Joo having lost her chance at
being King by a split second.]

885
00:53:31,958 --> 00:53:34,420
Why is he King? How can that be?

886
00:53:34,421 --> 00:53:37,554
- How can that be! No way!
- I got here first!

887
00:53:37,555 --> 00:53:39,936
Kwang Soo was the first one to arrive.

888
00:53:39,937 --> 00:53:41,587
I don't like this.

889
00:53:41,588 --> 00:53:43,331
What are you doing?

890
00:53:44,194 --> 00:53:48,804
[Then what is the mission given out to
the commoners outside of the King?]

891
00:53:48,805 --> 00:53:51,233
<i>You, who was not crowned
King is a commoner.</i>

892
00:53:51,234 --> 00:53:55,683
<i>Even if the King gets his name tag
ripped off, he is not ousted.</i>

893
00:53:55,706 --> 00:54:00,670
<i>Avoid the King who's trying to oust the King,
and find the ballot to cast your vote.</i>

894
00:54:00,671 --> 00:54:04,639
<i>And according to the vote, the
King can be changed out to someone else.</i>

895
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:08,022
[The person who receives more than half
the votes will become the new King!]

896
00:54:09,051 --> 00:54:11,617
[I could've been the first King...]

897
00:54:14,241 --> 00:54:18,578
[King Kwang Soo is to move to
the King's throne.]

898
00:54:21,228 --> 00:54:25,963
[The first Running King is Lee Kwang Soo.]

899
00:54:26,818 --> 00:54:30,190
- The King cannot be ousted.
- The King is untouchable.

900
00:54:30,191 --> 00:54:34,620
<i>Avoid the King who's trying to oust the King,
and find the ballot to cast your vote.</i>

901
00:54:34,621 --> 00:54:39,778
<i>The person who receives more than half
the votes will become the new King!</i>

902
00:54:39,779 --> 00:54:41,979
Then we can keep switching out the King?

903
00:54:42,429 --> 00:54:46,664
<i>So the last person left remaining alive
will become the final and ultimate King.</i>

904
00:54:50,476 --> 00:54:55,773
[Battle of the Kings... Start!]

905
00:55:00,328 --> 00:55:03,018
[The throne and the robe...]

906
00:55:05,329 --> 00:55:08,203
- Is that a real throne?
- Your Majesty, please come this way.

907
00:55:10,364 --> 00:55:13,696
[Eunuch Dong Wan]

908
00:55:14,503 --> 00:55:16,309
Please change into your royal gown.

909
00:55:16,310 --> 00:55:18,305
- I have to change too?
- Your royal gown.

910
00:55:19,505 --> 00:55:21,150
This really is like being the King!

911
00:55:22,403 --> 00:55:25,613
Okay. Then I shall change into
the royal gown.

912
00:55:32,429 --> 00:55:34,667
I'm the King of Joseon!

913
00:55:36,719 --> 00:55:38,725
[The intimidating stare...]

914
00:55:38,725 --> 00:55:43,085
[The birth of the Running King...]

915
00:55:43,086 --> 00:55:49,492
[His name is... Kwang Soo...]

916
00:55:52,278 --> 00:55:55,730
All those that tried to undermine me,
and tried to plot against me...

917
00:55:55,731 --> 00:55:59,952
All my enemies that have tried to
rid me of my name tag...

918
00:55:59,953 --> 00:56:04,047
Those who are vying for my seat on the
throne by voting against me...

919
00:56:04,048 --> 00:56:06,756
I will make sure to catch you one by one.

920
00:56:07,189 --> 00:56:10,992
And I will... pull you out by the roots.

921
00:56:10,993 --> 00:56:12,623
I am...

922
00:56:13,499 --> 00:56:15,807
Kwang!

923
00:56:17,455 --> 00:56:18,690
Kim Jong Kook...

924
00:56:20,405 --> 00:56:22,244
You're dead.

925
00:56:23,256 --> 00:56:25,802
Can't we just get started right now?

926
00:56:25,803 --> 00:56:28,110
I can't endure this any longer.
I can't wait!

927
00:56:28,111 --> 00:56:32,780
[Will he be able to take down
his enemies?]

928
00:56:41,552 --> 00:56:44,584
[King Giraffe finally steps
outside the palace!]

929
00:56:45,652 --> 00:56:48,785
You scoundrels...
You dare vie the King's throne!

930
00:56:49,556 --> 00:56:51,625
You won't be forgiven!

931
00:56:54,168 --> 00:56:56,293
Kwang Soo... it's Kwang Soo!

932
00:57:00,131 --> 00:57:02,986
[King Giraffe Kwang Soo
frightening the villagers.]

933
00:57:02,987 --> 00:57:05,608
Seriously... Lee Kwang Soo is the King?

934
00:57:05,609 --> 00:57:07,494
[Commoners getting flustered over
the presence of the King.]

935
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:15,182
Hey! Lee Kwang Soo!

936
00:57:16,018 --> 00:57:18,063
I will follow you to the depths of hell!

937
00:57:26,164 --> 00:57:28,487
Kwang Soo... it's Kwang Soo!

938
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:32,636
<i>I will follow you to the depths of hell!</i>

939
00:57:37,949 --> 00:57:39,035
Where?

940
00:57:39,036 --> 00:57:40,448
Where is he?

941
00:57:41,992 --> 00:57:43,878
Kim Jong Kook, come out here!

942
00:57:44,994 --> 00:57:48,005
[Within moments, King Giraffe Kwang Soo
has become an object of terror.]

943
00:57:51,714 --> 00:57:53,953
- This is really hurting my pride.
- Seriously.

944
00:57:53,954 --> 00:57:58,007
[A stab at their pride to be
chased around by the Giraffe.]

945
00:58:00,372 --> 00:58:02,329
[Is he gone?]

946
00:58:11,058 --> 00:58:15,598
[Two commoners frightened
over the King's tyranny.]

947
00:58:15,599 --> 00:58:18,583
Kwang Soo's gone crazy
and is causing chaos right now.

948
00:58:18,584 --> 00:58:20,356
He's a total tyrant!

949
00:58:20,357 --> 00:58:23,219
- You go keep watch over there.
- You're going to the other side then?

950
00:58:23,220 --> 00:58:24,868
I'll start searching over here.

951
00:58:26,521 --> 00:58:28,227
Think, Hyo Joo.

952
00:58:28,228 --> 00:58:31,979
There's no way that it would be tucked
inside one of these countless number of books.

953
00:58:31,980 --> 00:58:34,049
How am I going to check through them all?

954
00:58:34,939 --> 00:58:36,485
That would make no sense.

955
00:58:37,629 --> 00:58:39,388
But maybe I should still check.

956
00:58:40,361 --> 00:58:43,410
<i>Welcome to Running Man...</i>

957
00:58:47,381 --> 00:58:50,889
[Even the Go-rtle is leisurely
searching for the ballots...]

958
00:58:51,717 --> 00:58:54,150
[Where are the ballots...]

959
00:58:58,570 --> 00:59:00,709
[Could that be?]

960
00:59:02,754 --> 00:59:05,819
[It is! He discovered a ballot!]

961
00:59:07,302 --> 00:59:10,977
[Oh... the leisurely Go-rtle is
the first to discover one!]

962
00:59:20,824 --> 00:59:24,301
[Right around the same time,
Big-nosed Brother discovers one too!]

963
00:59:25,088 --> 00:59:27,325
The voting booth was around
that way somewhere!

964
00:59:28,238 --> 00:59:30,520
- I found one!
- Suk Jin, you found a ballot?

965
00:59:30,521 --> 00:59:33,542
- Jae Suk, this is what it looks like.
- Where did you find it?

966
00:59:33,543 --> 00:59:35,434
Suk Jin, hurry up and vote.
Go and vote for yourself.

967
00:59:35,435 --> 00:59:37,444
Hurry up and vote. Go do it.

968
00:59:37,445 --> 00:59:41,061
- Jae Suk, did you tell Suk Jin to do it?
- Suk Jin needs to become King for now.

969
00:59:45,934 --> 00:59:47,627
I'm going to vote for myself.

970
00:59:56,456 --> 00:59:58,171
- Hyo Joo...
- Yes?

971
01:00:00,597 --> 01:00:02,326
Is Kwang Soo up there?

972
01:00:05,403 --> 01:00:06,592
You found one?

973
01:00:06,817 --> 01:00:09,328
Hurry up and vote for Suk Jin.

974
01:00:10,072 --> 01:00:12,961
- That way...
- But why are we voting for Suk Jin?

975
01:00:12,962 --> 01:00:16,747
We have to have the weakest person be
the King so that it puts us more at ease.

976
01:00:16,748 --> 01:00:20,623
[Putting the weakest person on the
throne will make it easy for the rest of us!]

977
01:00:20,624 --> 01:00:22,675
And as soon as the vote comes out,
we'll get rid of Kwang Soo first!

978
01:00:24,921 --> 01:00:28,008
- That's the way to do it, Hyo Joo.
- Jae Suk, then I'm going to vote for Suk Jin.

979
01:00:28,009 --> 01:00:30,037
Yeah. Go vote for Suk Jin.

980
01:00:38,765 --> 01:00:40,752
- Where's Gary?
- There's Kwang Soo.

981
01:00:40,753 --> 01:00:44,663
King? Is he the King?
He can't be, right?

982
01:00:44,664 --> 01:00:47,908
[If he can somehow catch those two,
that would be a great feat!]

983
01:00:48,619 --> 01:00:51,360
- He's King...
- No way he could be the King.

984
01:00:52,351 --> 01:00:58,147
[Approaching without even greeting anyone...
and changing his direction...]

985
01:00:58,147 --> 01:01:01,857
[His first target is to attack Mr. Capable!]

986
01:01:02,660 --> 01:01:03,873
Let go of me!

987
01:01:03,874 --> 01:01:05,452
I have to do this!

988
01:01:09,740 --> 01:01:12,079
- Okay... just let go of my arms.
- I don't want to! No...

989
01:01:12,079 --> 01:01:17,174
[Even though he's become the King,
he's still as powerless as ever...]

990
01:01:19,095 --> 01:01:22,123
Your Majesty... it's time
for you to return to the palace.

991
01:01:22,124 --> 01:01:25,760
[Hwan Goong -
Means, return to the palace.]

992
01:01:25,761 --> 01:01:27,214
Ah, he has to go back to the palace?

993
01:01:27,214 --> 01:01:28,739
It's time for you to take care of
your affairs at the palace.

994
01:01:28,740 --> 01:01:30,893
There is such a thing?

995
01:01:30,894 --> 01:01:36,419
[Rule: The king has to return to the palace
every 10 minutes to take care of affairs.]

996
01:01:36,420 --> 01:01:38,578
[Tsk tsk... already down to no energy?]

997
01:01:39,873 --> 01:01:43,534
[Just what kind of affairs does he
have to take care of at the palace?]

998
01:01:43,535 --> 01:01:45,033
What are my affairs that need
my attention?

999
01:01:45,034 --> 01:01:47,809
[He needs to take care of his affairs for
him to go back out to the chase!]

1000
01:01:47,810 --> 01:01:49,575
I don't have any time.

1001
01:01:50,162 --> 01:01:52,401
[Huh? Paper and the seal?]

1002
01:01:52,402 --> 01:01:53,742
What is it?

1003
01:01:53,743 --> 01:01:56,814
Your Majesty... you have to seal
each of those documents...

1004
01:01:56,815 --> 01:01:59,052
to take care of our governmental affairs.

1005
01:02:02,684 --> 01:02:04,145
Get out of here! I don't want to see you!

1006
01:02:06,109 --> 01:02:09,521
- Your Majesty, you have to stamp it correctly.
- Do you want to be punched correctly?

1007
01:02:10,843 --> 01:02:14,651
I thought that you were...
I thought you were here to help me.

1008
01:02:15,994 --> 01:02:18,723
[No matter how many time he stamps it,
the pile of paper seems to be never-ending.]

1009
01:02:20,817 --> 01:02:22,067
I don't have any time.

1010
01:02:22,068 --> 01:02:23,917
Why are these papers so thin?

1011
01:02:24,832 --> 01:02:27,115
[Did you think that being
a King would be easy?]

1012
01:02:27,116 --> 01:02:28,548
How many sheets are there?

1013
01:02:29,005 --> 01:02:33,519
[During the time that the King is
taking care of his affairs...]

1014
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:37,266
[The commoners are finally
starting to cast their votes.]

1015
01:02:41,696 --> 01:02:43,043
Suk Jin...

1016
01:02:45,077 --> 01:02:49,224
[Go Soo casts his vote for Suk Jin,
making it a total of two for Suk Jin.]

1017
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:56,400
[On the other hand, Gary also steps in
to the voting booth after finding a ballot.]

1018
01:03:00,916 --> 01:03:03,872
[Suk Jin now has three votes. He only
needs one more to be the new King!]

1019
01:03:09,207 --> 01:03:11,137
There are two more here.

1020
01:03:16,792 --> 01:03:18,303
I'm finished!

1021
01:03:18,304 --> 01:03:21,328
- Your Majesty, it's time for inspection.
- Yes...

1022
01:03:22,865 --> 01:03:26,938
[King Giraffe Kwang Soo
heading off again?]

1023
01:03:30,237 --> 01:03:32,531
I think there may be something here...

1024
01:03:32,532 --> 01:03:36,769
[A huge white box...
could someone be in there?]

1025
01:03:38,317 --> 01:03:42,876
[Big-nosed Brother waiting in hiding
until he's crowned the new King.]

1026
01:03:42,877 --> 01:03:45,209
- Why are you in there?
- Hey...

1027
01:03:51,249 --> 01:03:53,990
[King Giraffe Kwang Soo having
witnessed the whole thing!]

1028
01:03:55,768 --> 01:03:58,207
[I'm in big trouble...]

1029
01:04:01,188 --> 01:04:04,177
[Big-nose's life hanging on the balance.]

1030
01:04:04,178 --> 01:04:06,375
- There's not much time.
- Wait, Kwang Soo, wait...

1031
01:04:06,376 --> 01:04:08,558
- Wait...
- There's no other choice!

1032
01:04:08,978 --> 01:04:13,367
[The affection between the
Easy Brothers comes and goes...]

1033
01:04:13,368 --> 01:04:15,506
- Let me be the King just once!
- You can't!

1034
01:04:15,507 --> 01:04:17,817
This isn't right!

1035
01:04:17,818 --> 01:04:21,468
Suk Jin... you and I can be together
again next week!

1036
01:04:21,469 --> 01:04:23,834
What did you just say right now? Hey!

1037
01:04:23,835 --> 01:04:27,552
Let's do it next week!
I have to do this!

1038
01:04:29,862 --> 01:04:32,957
- Lee Kwang Soo...
- Suk Jin... Pil-chok-cross!

1039
01:04:32,958 --> 01:04:34,545
Do you want to die?

1040
01:04:34,546 --> 01:04:39,863
<i>[Ji Suk Jin, out!
Ji Suk Jin, out!]</i>

1041
01:04:39,864 --> 01:04:43,486
<i>[The votes that you've cast so far are
no longer is valid.]</i>

1042
01:04:44,344 --> 01:04:48,609
[With Suk Jin being ousted,
the three votes casted are moot!]

1043
01:04:48,610 --> 01:04:50,558
Those votes are no longer valid?

1044
01:04:51,261 --> 01:04:56,333
[Has to start all over from the beginning
by finding the ballots again...]

1045
01:04:56,334 --> 01:04:58,620
I shouldn't have voted for Suk Jin...

1046
01:05:01,959 --> 01:05:06,632
[King Giraffe riding the high from the kill
to keep up with his hunting!]

1047
01:05:10,669 --> 01:05:13,427
<i>Yes, come on in.</i>

1048
01:05:15,041 --> 01:05:17,609
[But he surprises them with trying to
attack from behind!]

1049
01:05:17,610 --> 01:05:20,445
[King Giraffe can be quite terrifying!]

1050
01:05:22,619 --> 01:05:26,104
- Why is he so strong?
- Look at how aggressive he's being!

1051
01:05:26,105 --> 01:05:28,258
Ji Hyo, sorry.
Why don't you go over there?

1052
01:05:28,259 --> 01:05:32,215
[King Giraffe lightly letting go of Ji Hyo...]

1053
01:05:35,999 --> 01:05:39,335
[Then changes his target and
grabs Haroro!]

1054
01:05:39,336 --> 01:05:41,180
You evil King!

1055
01:05:42,134 --> 01:05:44,602
[King Giraffe putting in every bit of
his effort into the attack!]

1056
01:05:49,816 --> 01:05:51,973
I've fulfilled my purpose.

1057
01:05:53,044 --> 01:05:55,809
You coward...

1058
01:05:55,810 --> 01:05:58,020
<i>[Ha Ha, out!]</i>

1059
01:06:00,260 --> 01:06:04,394
[Needs to hurry and pick a new King...]

1060
01:06:04,395 --> 01:06:07,038
The ballots are white and folded in half.

1061
01:06:07,656 --> 01:06:10,000
It could be stuck in a book.

1062
01:06:11,452 --> 01:06:13,999
[Jae Suk finally discovers a ballot!]

1063
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:15,037
You found one?

1064
01:06:16,472 --> 01:06:18,108
I don't know who to vote for though.

1065
01:06:18,109 --> 01:06:20,829
[Who should they vote to be King now?]

1066
01:06:22,256 --> 01:06:24,262
- Want to be King?
- Me?

1067
01:06:25,726 --> 01:06:28,556
- Why don't you be King? Gary...
- Wait...

1068
01:06:28,557 --> 01:06:30,318
Why don't you be King Dog?

1069
01:06:30,319 --> 01:06:32,896
[King... Dog?]

1070
01:06:32,897 --> 01:06:34,716
- I'm going to vote for you.
- Really?

1071
01:06:35,245 --> 01:06:38,162
Thanks, Jae Suk... I'll be a good King.

1072
01:06:38,163 --> 01:06:39,470
Of course, I'm sure you will.

1073
01:06:40,320 --> 01:06:44,249
[Jae Suk heading off to the voting booth
to cast his ballot for Gary.]

1074
01:06:50,330 --> 01:06:51,516
Hyo Joo?

1075
01:06:51,517 --> 01:06:53,084
Hyo Joo?

1076
01:06:55,242 --> 01:06:56,404
Hyo Joo!

1077
01:07:02,279 --> 01:07:04,947
[Jae Suk casts his vote for
Hyo Joo to be the new King.]

1078
01:07:04,948 --> 01:07:06,062
Hyo Joo.

1079
01:07:06,344 --> 01:07:10,439
[Yoo-ruce Willis suggesting they pick
Hyo Joo to be the new King.]

1080
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:11,966
In that case...

1081
01:07:11,967 --> 01:07:13,837
- Let's make Hyo Joo the King...
- Yeah...

1082
01:07:13,838 --> 01:07:16,288
and oust a few people ourselves
that needs to be ousted.

1083
01:07:16,289 --> 01:07:18,298
- That's right! That's good thinking!
- And we can do another voting later.

1084
01:07:18,299 --> 01:07:20,671
- We can go about it that way.
- That's a good plan.

1085
01:07:30,562 --> 01:07:31,843
Where is it?

1086
01:07:31,844 --> 01:07:33,988
Did you find something? Where?

1087
01:07:35,966 --> 01:07:37,766
[A ballot...]

1088
01:07:37,767 --> 01:07:39,470
- I found it! Look!
- You found it?

1089
01:07:39,471 --> 01:07:42,527
[Gary discovers a ballot!]

1090
01:07:42,528 --> 01:07:47,265
[Gary hands off his ballot to Hyo Joo
and encourages her to vote for herself.]

1091
01:07:47,266 --> 01:07:50,426
There's a voting booth over there...
hurry up before you're caught.

1092
01:07:56,210 --> 01:07:58,961
What should I do once I become King?

1093
01:08:05,139 --> 01:08:07,386
[Hyo Joo casts a vote for herself.]

1094
01:08:07,387 --> 01:08:11,761
[Will she be able to become the
second King for Running Man kingdom?]

1095
01:08:14,477 --> 01:08:18,133
[King Giraffe taking care of
his affairs once again.]

1096
01:08:18,134 --> 01:08:20,020
- Eunuch Go...
- Yes?

1097
01:08:20,308 --> 01:08:22,994
- Get me some water.
- Yes, Your Highness.

1098
01:08:22,995 --> 01:08:25,480
Don't take the time out to answer,
and just get it to me!

1099
01:08:28,106 --> 01:08:29,151
I'm done!

1100
01:08:29,755 --> 01:08:30,826
I'm done!

1101
01:08:31,953 --> 01:08:34,907
- Your Highness, it's time for you to...
- Be quiet!

1102
01:08:37,609 --> 01:08:40,094
I'm the King of Joseon!

1103
01:08:41,306 --> 01:08:43,398
- Kwang Soo's coming!
- Where?

1104
01:08:43,399 --> 01:08:44,585
Come here, come here.

1105
01:08:44,586 --> 01:08:48,038
[Kwang Soo's closing in where
everyone's gathered around standing.]

1106
01:08:48,039 --> 01:08:49,916
- Hurry...
- I think he's gone crazy.

1107
01:08:49,917 --> 01:08:52,291
[King Giraffe getting crazier
with each passing moment.]

1108
01:08:52,292 --> 01:08:55,567
- How much time do you think you have left?
- I just need one of you!

1109
01:08:55,568 --> 01:08:57,779
- You don't have much time left now.
- Think carefully!

1110
01:08:57,780 --> 01:09:00,557
Hyo Joo... hurry up and find a ballot.

1111
01:09:02,408 --> 01:09:03,850
You're really tired too, aren't you?

1112
01:09:04,568 --> 01:09:06,390
Move out of the way.

1113
01:09:06,391 --> 01:09:07,903
I have no intentions to get you...

1114
01:09:07,904 --> 01:09:11,290
and I'm not even seeing clearly right now,
so just get out of the way!

1115
01:09:11,291 --> 01:09:13,965
We have to stop you.
We have no other choice.

1116
01:09:13,966 --> 01:09:16,230
Kwang Soo...
what's it like being the king?

1117
01:09:16,681 --> 01:09:19,683
Don't become King... it's hell.

1118
01:09:19,684 --> 01:09:21,238
How is this being the King?

1119
01:09:22,525 --> 01:09:24,673
It's okay. We have to stop him.
We have to stop him any way we can.

1120
01:09:24,674 --> 01:09:26,173
Everything is a battle right now...

1121
01:09:27,352 --> 01:09:29,598
[Where's King Giraffe heading to
all of a sudden?]

1122
01:09:30,346 --> 01:09:33,870
[The goal he's been eyeing is...
Han Hyo Joo!]

1123
01:09:34,473 --> 01:09:35,971
Hyo Joo... run!

1124
01:09:36,425 --> 01:09:38,899
[Go Soo succeeds in helping her get away!]

1125
01:09:39,503 --> 01:09:44,933
[While the men are busy warding him off,
the women can get busy searching!]

1126
01:09:48,208 --> 01:09:51,413
[Ji Hyo discovers a ballot!]

1127
01:09:52,292 --> 01:09:54,678
Let me just try it once.

1128
01:09:54,679 --> 01:09:57,861
- You can't tear it off. He can't be ousted.
- I just wanted to tear it off once.

1129
01:09:58,562 --> 01:10:03,228
[Trying to get him worked up even though
he's fully aware the King can't be ousted.]

1130
01:10:04,701 --> 01:10:08,163
[Fine... you're playing with me?]

1131
01:10:09,495 --> 01:10:14,302
[Out of six commoners,
Hyo Joo currently has two votes.]

1132
01:10:15,776 --> 01:10:18,963
[King Giraffe operates on full power!]

1133
01:10:19,497 --> 01:10:23,853
[Ji Hyo's vote... goes to Hyo Joo!]

1134
01:10:23,854 --> 01:10:27,411
[Hyo Joo gains half the votes
from the commoners!]

1135
01:10:28,419 --> 01:10:31,491
[But it can only be put into effect
once the poll results are announced!]

1136
01:10:31,492 --> 01:10:32,792
[Jong Kook in danger!]

1137
01:10:32,792 --> 01:10:36,470
[Will the announcement be made first,
or will he be ousted first?]

1138
01:10:38,973 --> 01:10:43,924
[Total chaos]

1139
01:10:43,925 --> 01:10:47,733
<i>[Cease all activities!]</i>

1140
01:10:47,734 --> 01:10:50,358
<i>We have the poll results.</i>

1141
01:10:51,160 --> 01:10:53,282
<i>We have the poll results.</i>

1142
01:10:53,283 --> 01:10:56,451
<i>Any surviving commoners,
please cease all activities.</i>

1143
01:10:56,452 --> 01:10:59,585
<i>Any surviving commoners,
please cease all activities.</i>

1144
01:11:00,160 --> 01:11:03,977
<i>We will be announcing the poll results.</i>

1145
01:11:05,695 --> 01:11:11,380
[At last... there will be a new King.]

1146
01:11:11,848 --> 01:11:14,115
You can just stay here
until you are sent off to jail.

1147
01:11:14,519 --> 01:11:17,294
No... let me formally apologize
to everyone.

1148
01:11:20,132 --> 01:11:22,277
<i>We have the poll results.</i>

1149
01:11:22,791 --> 01:11:25,185
<i>We have the poll results.</i>

1150
01:11:25,186 --> 01:11:26,664
But I can be the King again.

1151
01:11:26,665 --> 01:11:28,998
You think anyone of us would
vote for you?

1152
01:11:28,999 --> 01:11:31,464
<i>The next King that Running Man
has voted for is...</i>

1153
01:11:32,277 --> 01:11:35,523
<i>The next King that Running Man
has voted for is...</i>

1154
01:11:36,016 --> 01:11:39,920
<i>Out of six, three of you have chosen...</i>

1155
01:11:40,780 --> 01:11:43,475
<i>Han Hyo Joo.</i>

1156
01:11:44,368 --> 01:11:46,212
- Grab him!
- Wait!

1157
01:11:47,749 --> 01:11:53,287
[Han Hyo Joo voted as the second King
of the Running Man kingdom.]

1158
01:11:53,288 --> 01:11:55,064
Then I'm the new King?

1159
01:11:55,065 --> 01:11:57,787
Then it means...
I can oust them all now?

1160
01:12:01,193 --> 01:12:05,444
Your Majesty... congratulations.
It's a great pleasure to meet you.

1161
01:12:06,228 --> 01:12:07,990
I am Eunuch Go.

1162
01:12:08,598 --> 01:12:11,806
I see. I'm very glad to see you.

1163
01:12:12,494 --> 01:12:14,134
Go on. Attach it to my back.

1164
01:12:15,132 --> 01:12:19,111
[Second King of Running Man Kingdom-
Han Hyo Joo.]

1165
01:12:19,112 --> 01:12:21,186
<i>Cease on all activities removed.</i>

1166
01:12:21,187 --> 01:12:24,054
<i>Time of the new King has arrived.</i>

1167
01:12:26,572 --> 01:12:29,049
Time of the new King has arrived.

1168
01:12:29,392 --> 01:12:31,510
That feels really good to hear.

1169
01:12:32,342 --> 01:12:35,092
Your Majesty, you will have to return to
the palace in 10 minutes

1170
01:12:35,093 --> 01:12:37,257
so you have to hurry on with your inspection.

1171
01:12:37,327 --> 01:12:39,670
What's there to rush when I'm the King?

1172
01:12:39,671 --> 01:12:43,601
[A completely different Hyo Joo
now that she's the King!]

1173
01:12:43,602 --> 01:12:47,336
There's nothing to rush around for.
I can take my time with the inspection.

1174
01:12:47,337 --> 01:12:50,169
Shall we go to meet the commoners?

1175
01:12:51,644 --> 01:12:56,798
[Heading off to find the former King,
commoner Kwang Soo first?]

1176
01:12:56,799 --> 01:12:58,598
Everyone will be waiting for me to
oust Kwang Soo first.

1177
01:12:59,162 --> 01:13:02,414
- Hyo Joo...
- We have him captured as an offering to you.

1178
01:13:02,415 --> 01:13:05,431
- Hyo Joo!
- We worked really hard to capture him.

1179
01:13:06,185 --> 01:13:09,731
[The dethroned King's rage.]

1180
01:13:09,732 --> 01:13:12,291
- Please send him for us.
- Please take care of him.

1181
01:13:12,292 --> 01:13:15,564
- You have to let me go!
- Please take care of him...

1182
01:13:16,261 --> 01:13:20,498
[The request to take care of him
by all the commoners.]

1183
01:13:20,499 --> 01:13:23,918
- He's caused too much havoc as King.
- I was going to let him off the hook once...

1184
01:13:23,919 --> 01:13:27,217
- Let me off the hook just once.
- But you've committed too many sins.

1185
01:13:27,218 --> 01:13:30,889
- What wrong have I done?
- You made me eat fermented fish yesterday!

1186
01:13:30,890 --> 01:13:33,426
<i>You made me eat fermented
fish yesterday!</i>

1187
01:13:33,427 --> 01:13:36,244
[Did you think I'd forget?]

1188
01:13:36,245 --> 01:13:38,707
- Try to remember!
- I don't remember that!

1189
01:13:39,911 --> 01:13:43,724
[The night before when
they were making kimchi...]

1190
01:13:43,725 --> 01:13:50,492
[Kwang Soo having tricked her into eating
super salty fermented fish wrap.]

1191
01:13:50,493 --> 01:13:53,280
- You're still holding that grudge?
- I want you to remember!

1192
01:13:53,281 --> 01:13:56,527
- You remember what you did!
- You can't forgive him!

1193
01:13:56,528 --> 01:13:59,197
Wait! You can't! I'm a King!

1194
01:13:59,198 --> 01:14:00,918
<i>I'm a King!</i>

1195
01:14:00,919 --> 01:14:03,175
<i>I'm a King!</i>

1196
01:14:07,728 --> 01:14:12,077
[Ah... what ruin of power...]

1197
01:14:12,078 --> 01:14:14,085
You really are a righteous King.

1198
01:14:14,086 --> 01:14:18,332
<i>[Lee Kwang Soo, out!
Lee Kwang Soo, out!]</i>

1199
01:14:18,760 --> 01:14:19,859
I was a King...

1200
01:14:19,860 --> 01:14:24,633
[All the power is given to the King
by the people...]

1201
01:14:26,278 --> 01:14:29,336
We will follow the will of our King.

1202
01:14:29,337 --> 01:14:32,898
- Just give us the order.
- Who shall we take care of for you?

1203
01:14:38,264 --> 01:14:39,790
My King...

1204
01:14:39,791 --> 01:14:42,187
[A market target?]

1205
01:14:42,188 --> 01:14:46,741
A target tiger in a hunt
needs to be skinned...

1206
01:14:48,223 --> 01:14:52,668
[Starting off by eliminating Jong Kook
to make it easier for the ultimate victory?]

1207
01:14:52,669 --> 01:14:56,592
- We have to get the tiger of its skin.
- If anything, keep me by your side.

1208
01:14:56,593 --> 01:15:00,367
- Why don't you use me as your man instead?
- Oh... that's not a bad idea!

1209
01:15:00,368 --> 01:15:02,279
- I can catch them for you...
- Think about this carefully.

1210
01:15:02,723 --> 01:15:06,247
How are you planning on taking care of him
when it's just the two of you left?

1211
01:15:06,248 --> 01:15:09,443
- Please use me as your man...
- Please look at the size of his thighs.

1212
01:15:09,444 --> 01:15:12,123
[They're all making right arguments...]

1213
01:15:12,124 --> 01:15:15,719
Use me as your man...
and remain eternal as the Queen.

1214
01:15:16,445 --> 01:15:19,892
[Just what will she select?]

1215
01:15:21,219 --> 01:15:23,580
You've said something
very interesting just now.

1216
01:15:23,581 --> 01:15:25,318
I appoint you as my personal warrior.

1217
01:15:25,319 --> 01:15:27,359
- I appoint you as my personal warrior.
- Yes, that's right!

1218
01:15:27,360 --> 01:15:30,635
[Jong Kook appointed as the personal warrior
to the second King, Han Hyo Joo.]

1219
01:15:30,636 --> 01:15:32,915
Wait, wait...

1220
01:15:32,916 --> 01:15:35,359
- Wait, wait...
- Darn it!

1221
01:15:35,360 --> 01:15:37,995
When we made you our Queen!

1222
01:15:37,996 --> 01:15:39,918
How could you?

1223
01:15:39,919 --> 01:15:41,284
Who should we catch, my Queen?

1224
01:15:41,285 --> 01:15:43,499
- Gary!
- I will catch Gary for you!

1225
01:15:43,500 --> 01:15:45,844
My Queen! I will get him for you!

1226
01:15:45,845 --> 01:15:47,510
My Queen!

1227
01:15:49,630 --> 01:15:51,672
I don't have to do any work, right?

1228
01:15:53,552 --> 01:15:55,181
Since I'm the King...

1229
01:15:55,182 --> 01:15:57,977
[Leave the hunting to her warrior,
and the King takes a leisurely stroll.]

1230
01:15:59,079 --> 01:16:02,949
[Forgetting the grace of the commoners
for choosing her as their King.]

1231
01:16:02,950 --> 01:16:04,757
I have to find the ballots.

1232
01:16:06,290 --> 01:16:09,681
Wait... when we're the ones
who made her King...

1233
01:16:09,682 --> 01:16:13,168
- But within moments...
- Jong Kook really is something else.

1234
01:16:15,065 --> 01:16:19,550
[But the commoners always have
the power of the ballots!]

1235
01:16:19,551 --> 01:16:24,409
[Find the ballots and elect a new King!]

1236
01:16:24,410 --> 01:16:25,484
Please...

1237
01:16:29,250 --> 01:16:33,391
I have a lot of interest in thrillers
and chase movies.

1238
01:16:33,392 --> 01:16:40,229
I feel like I'm one of the
characters in those movies.

1239
01:16:40,230 --> 01:16:42,847
The thrill of it is no joke.

1240
01:16:44,595 --> 01:16:46,408
Warrior!

1241
01:16:47,745 --> 01:16:49,678
Warrior!

1242
01:16:49,679 --> 01:16:52,147
- Yes, My Queen!
- Warrior!

1243
01:16:52,148 --> 01:16:53,809
Where are you?

1244
01:16:53,810 --> 01:16:54,888
Who should I catch for you?

1245
01:16:54,888 --> 01:17:01,266
[Loyal servant to the Queen.
Commoner Jong Kook promoted to her warrior.]

1246
01:17:03,739 --> 01:17:06,363
My ultimate goal during my ruling...

1247
01:17:07,993 --> 01:17:09,918
is to eliminate all commoners.

1248
01:17:13,858 --> 01:17:16,674
[Ballots, ballots...]

1249
01:17:19,384 --> 01:17:22,166
[Warrior Jong Kook attacks Gary!]

1250
01:17:22,167 --> 01:17:24,060
Did you find him?

1251
01:17:26,345 --> 01:17:28,197
- I have captured him, My Queen.
- Wait...

1252
01:17:28,198 --> 01:17:32,174
I will give you one last chance
to say your peace.

1253
01:17:32,175 --> 01:17:34,233
Say just one thing.

1254
01:17:34,234 --> 01:17:35,609
I love you.

1255
01:17:36,451 --> 01:17:39,468
[I... love you?]

1256
01:17:39,469 --> 01:17:41,409
I have loved you.

1257
01:17:41,410 --> 01:17:44,444
If that's a sin, then be rid of me.

1258
01:17:44,445 --> 01:17:47,276
A commoner isn't supposed to
love the Queen.

1259
01:17:48,038 --> 01:17:53,621
- My sin is to have loved the Queen.
- Your sin is too great.

1260
01:17:55,248 --> 01:17:59,581
[For the sin of loving the Queen... out!]

1261
01:17:59,582 --> 01:18:01,656
- You really are a righteous Queen.
- You won't last long.

1262
01:18:01,657 --> 01:18:05,613
<i>[Gary, out! Gary, out!]</i>

1263
01:18:06,622 --> 01:18:11,651
[The Queen and her warrior rushing
off to their next target!]

1264
01:18:13,159 --> 01:18:17,917
[While the number of commoners
are diminishing one by one...]

1265
01:18:25,569 --> 01:18:28,218
[Jae Suk discovers a ballot!]

1266
01:18:28,785 --> 01:18:30,180
Who should I pick?

1267
01:18:36,724 --> 01:18:39,722
[Jae Suk finishes voting
without a long hesitation.]

1268
01:18:42,497 --> 01:18:45,335
[Go Soo also heads into the voting booth
after having found a ballot.]

1269
01:18:46,224 --> 01:18:49,756
[Go Soo also rushes to cast his vote!]

1270
01:18:49,757 --> 01:18:54,403
[Just who did they pick?]

1271
01:18:56,061 --> 01:18:59,775
[At the same time...]

1272
01:18:59,776 --> 01:19:02,701
 I played a Royal Concubine until recently...

1273
01:19:03,611 --> 01:19:06,066
And now, I'm the King.

1274
01:19:06,067 --> 01:19:07,548
- Your Majesty...
- Yes?

1275
01:19:07,549 --> 01:19:09,555
We've received some things that needs
your attention while you've been gone.

1276
01:19:10,470 --> 01:19:14,222
If you can thread five of these marbles,
you can go back out to hunt.

1277
01:19:14,222 --> 01:19:19,760
Yes, I will thread them quickly
and capture the rest.

1278
01:19:21,189 --> 01:19:23,344
In that case...

1279
01:19:23,345 --> 01:19:25,586
Oh my, this isn't threading easily.

1280
01:19:33,364 --> 01:19:36,436
I hope they don't find any ballots
while I'm gone.

1281
01:19:37,174 --> 01:19:41,148
Your Majesty, your subjects are finding
ballots right now, you must hurry.

1282
01:19:41,149 --> 01:19:44,226
I'm aware of that.
Don't rush me.

1283
01:19:44,226 --> 01:19:46,264
It's making it even harder to thread.

1284
01:19:52,798 --> 01:19:55,750
I'm almost done.

1285
01:19:55,751 --> 01:19:58,027
[Already finished threading four!]

1286
01:19:58,028 --> 01:19:59,717
This is my last marble.

1287
01:20:00,731 --> 01:20:03,271
Shall we go back out to hunt?

1288
01:20:05,087 --> 01:20:08,617
I need to dress like the commoners
when I'm going outside the palace.

1289
01:20:09,427 --> 01:20:11,593
Where is my warrior?

1290
01:20:13,745 --> 01:20:15,108
- Go Soo...
- Yes?

1291
01:20:15,109 --> 01:20:16,782
Who did you vote for?

1292
01:20:16,783 --> 01:20:20,432
- I voted for you.
- You should've voted for Ji Hyo!

1293
01:20:23,842 --> 01:20:27,236
[Warrior Jong Kook seems to be
planning on making Jae Suk his offering.]

1294
01:20:29,580 --> 01:20:32,718
[Commoner Jae Suk in extreme danger!]

1295
01:20:32,719 --> 01:20:34,917
Here... we're here!

1296
01:20:37,096 --> 01:20:41,710
[Just then, Ji Hyo discovers a ballot!]

1297
01:20:45,867 --> 01:20:50,320
[Just who will she vote for?]

1298
01:20:57,411 --> 01:20:59,951
<i>Cease all activities.
Cease all activities.</i>

1299
01:21:01,326 --> 01:21:03,526
<i>The voting is now over.</i>

1300
01:21:05,370 --> 01:21:11,698
<i>All surviving commoners cease activities.
Voting results will soon be announced.</i>

1301
01:21:13,182 --> 01:21:16,074
<i>Voting results will soon be announced.</i>

1302
01:21:16,074 --> 01:21:18,538
No way. That's a lie, right?
There hasn't been a vote, right?

1303
01:21:19,892 --> 01:21:21,983
I'm not... no way.

1304
01:21:23,769 --> 01:21:26,882
[It seems as though Ji Hyo's vote
was the deciding factor!]

1305
01:21:26,883 --> 01:21:31,715
- I was going to vote for Ji Hyo...
- We now have the voting results.

1306
01:21:32,357 --> 01:21:34,053
I'm sure it's one of you guys.

1307
01:21:34,054 --> 01:21:36,701
<i>The next King that
Running Man has chosen...</i>

1308
01:21:37,385 --> 01:21:39,145
<i>The next King is...</i>

1309
01:21:39,353 --> 01:21:42,533
<i>With two votes out of four votes...</i>

1310
01:21:45,446 --> 01:21:48,534
<i>With two votes out of four votes...</i>

1311
01:21:51,335 --> 01:21:52,522
<i>Yoo Jae Suk!</i>

1312
01:21:52,523 --> 01:21:53,604
Me?

1313
01:21:53,605 --> 01:21:58,445
[Yoo Jae Suk,
the third King of Running Man Kingdom.]

1314
01:21:58,446 --> 01:21:59,669
Me?

1315
01:22:00,022 --> 01:22:04,821
[Go Soo and Ji Hyo voted
for Jae Suk!]

1316
01:22:04,822 --> 01:22:06,447
Good work.

1317
01:22:07,970 --> 01:22:09,168
Go Soo...

1318
01:22:09,168 --> 01:22:13,453
[As soon as he becomes the King,
his speech pattern suddenly changes.]

1319
01:22:14,722 --> 01:22:16,428
This can't be!

1320
01:22:16,429 --> 01:22:19,214
I can't step down from my
throne like this!

1321
01:22:19,215 --> 01:22:21,152
This can't be!

1322
01:22:23,326 --> 01:22:25,607
- I'm honored.
- Oust them.

1323
01:22:25,608 --> 01:22:28,077
I don't want to be a warrior.

1324
01:22:29,442 --> 01:22:32,472
You're not a warrior, but a General.

1325
01:22:32,837 --> 01:22:34,598
- You're a General.
- I don't want to be a General either.

1326
01:22:34,599 --> 01:22:37,353
I want to remain a commoner.

1327
01:22:37,354 --> 01:22:42,512
Your Majesty... it is my honor to
serve you. I'm Eunuch Go.

1328
01:22:42,512 --> 01:22:44,960
Start off by ousting Jong Kook.

1329
01:22:44,961 --> 01:22:47,074
We'll talk again after
you've ousted Kim Jong Kook.

1330
01:22:47,075 --> 01:22:50,327
<i>Ban on cease of activity  is lifted.
Ban on cease of activity is lifted.</i>

1331
01:22:50,328 --> 01:22:52,573
[Third King of Running Man Kingdom,
Yoo Jae Suk.]

1332
01:22:52,574 --> 01:22:54,562
Warrior!

1333
01:22:54,917 --> 01:22:57,499
Make sure to stay alive!

1334
01:22:59,587 --> 01:23:07,764
[Now that she's returned to being a commoner,
she is off to find the ballots yet again!]

1335
01:23:21,395 --> 01:23:23,660
Down. Get down!

1336
01:23:25,469 --> 01:23:29,474
[Along with Eunuch Go and his
VJ Gwon Yeol...]

1337
01:23:32,211 --> 01:23:34,856
I feel like there would be one
around here somewhere...

1338
01:23:39,174 --> 01:23:42,547
[King Grasshopper discovers Hyo Joo!]

1339
01:23:43,358 --> 01:23:47,930
[King Grasshopper trying to stop
her from trying to steal back the throne!]

1340
01:23:48,182 --> 01:23:50,535
Warrior!

1341
01:23:53,699 --> 01:23:57,877
[Even though he is no longer
her warrior...]

1342
01:23:57,878 --> 01:23:59,187
Come here.

1343
01:24:00,284 --> 01:24:06,544
[So even though he no longer
has to protect her...]

1344
01:24:06,545 --> 01:24:08,046
Wait...

1345
01:24:09,133 --> 01:24:11,176
It's all over.

1346
01:24:12,205 --> 01:24:13,579
Queen...

1347
01:24:16,124 --> 01:24:17,660
Queen...

1348
01:24:17,661 --> 01:24:22,307
[In order to protect her...]

1349
01:24:24,278 --> 01:24:27,956
- It's all over now.
- Run, My Queen! Run!

1350
01:24:27,957 --> 01:24:29,717
- Run!
- Hey...

1351
01:24:29,718 --> 01:24:32,430
How could you do this to your King?

1352
01:24:35,026 --> 01:24:37,603
I'll go and get back the throne!

1353
01:24:37,604 --> 01:24:39,881
- I will buy you some time!
- You're not going to buy anything!

1354
01:24:39,882 --> 01:24:44,920
[Escape... far away...]

1355
01:24:48,017 --> 01:24:49,864
I got to make kimchi...

1356
01:24:50,698 --> 01:24:52,675
Got to split firewood...

1357
01:24:54,299 --> 01:24:56,463
And even got to become a King.

1358
01:24:58,381 --> 01:24:59,987
I have no regrets.

1359
01:25:02,609 --> 01:25:06,600
[Her warrior trying to buy her
time to the end.]

1360
01:25:08,045 --> 01:25:10,007
- I will buy you time. Make your escape.
- You're not buying her anything.

1361
01:25:10,008 --> 01:25:12,415
Run... run and stay alive.

1362
01:25:12,416 --> 01:25:14,527
Hurry up and rip it off.

1363
01:25:15,422 --> 01:25:16,951
Warrior...

1364
01:25:17,800 --> 01:25:21,545
I will never forget...
your grace and loyalty.

1365
01:25:30,284 --> 01:25:32,850
[Jong Kook, out!]

1366
01:25:33,694 --> 01:25:38,558
We just ripped the skin off the tiger...

1367
01:25:40,731 --> 01:25:43,192
You really were so dashing...

1368
01:25:44,571 --> 01:25:46,764
Thank you.

1369
01:25:46,765 --> 01:25:48,099
[Thank you...]

1370
01:25:48,835 --> 01:25:52,199
[Three commoners left alive are,
Go Soo, Ji Hyo and Hyo Joo.]

1371
01:25:52,837 --> 01:25:56,250
[Go Soo and Ji Hyo taking a brief rest.]

1372
01:25:56,251 --> 01:25:58,828
- I bet the show really gets you in shape.
- No...

1373
01:25:58,829 --> 01:26:03,295
- How long has it been? Seven years?
- It's been seven years since I've seen you.

1374
01:26:03,296 --> 01:26:08,667
The movie we did together.
But you haven't changed a single bit.

1375
01:26:08,668 --> 01:26:12,111
- I'm still the same? Is it a good thing?
- Even back in the day, you were very...

1376
01:26:12,794 --> 01:26:19,392
You were always at ease...
and was often lost in thought...

1377
01:26:19,393 --> 01:26:23,031
I was watching you speak yesterday...

1378
01:26:23,032 --> 01:26:25,950
And I though to myself,
'He's just like he was seven years ago!'.

1379
01:26:25,951 --> 01:26:28,176
I kept thinking that to myself
all day yesterday.

1380
01:26:29,772 --> 01:26:32,767
[Whatever...]

1381
01:26:33,491 --> 01:26:38,482
[Just the two that voted for me are left...
I'm left with no choice...]

1382
01:26:40,599 --> 01:26:43,279
[Ji Hyo discovers King Grasshopper!]

1383
01:26:45,023 --> 01:26:48,656
[Leisurely Go-rtle fails at
making his escape.]

1384
01:26:48,657 --> 01:26:52,767
- My shoulder is in pain...
- But why are you standing there?

1385
01:26:53,105 --> 01:26:56,664
[Who will King Grasshopper oust first?]

1386
01:26:57,525 --> 01:26:59,374
- What are you going to do?
- About what?

1387
01:27:00,544 --> 01:27:03,005
You're not about to
betray me right now, are you?

1388
01:27:03,690 --> 01:27:06,615
[To anyone eyes, it looks as though
he's getting ready to sacrifice Ji Hyo.]

1389
01:27:07,514 --> 01:27:10,346
- You two are working together?
- Ji Hyo...

1390
01:27:10,347 --> 01:27:14,193
You two are working together?
You think you can oust Hyo Joo?

1391
01:27:14,990 --> 01:27:20,223
Think about it carefully.
You may need me more than Go Soo.

1392
01:27:20,224 --> 01:27:21,637
Think about this carefully, okay?

1393
01:27:23,568 --> 01:27:26,960
- Think about it carefully, Jae Suk.
- But I have no greed for the throne.

1394
01:27:26,961 --> 01:27:33,133
Like I said, I don't want the throne,
but I can be of great help to the King.

1395
01:27:33,134 --> 01:27:35,732
- You know I played a lot of Princess roles...
- That's true.

1396
01:27:35,733 --> 01:27:40,210
- So think about it very carefully, Jae Suk.
- This is getting confusing.

1397
01:27:40,644 --> 01:27:42,398
You really have to think carefully.

1398
01:27:49,403 --> 01:27:50,643
- Go Soo...
- Yes?

1399
01:27:51,813 --> 01:27:53,236
I'll grab onto him.

1400
01:27:55,102 --> 01:27:58,941
[It seems as though King Grasshopper
has decided to get rid of Go Soo first.]

1401
01:27:58,942 --> 01:28:00,834
- Wait...
- Come here for now.

1402
01:28:00,835 --> 01:28:04,330
[Will the naive Go Soo be able to
escape this danger?]

1403
01:28:12,360 --> 01:28:14,934
[What humiliation...]

1404
01:28:17,303 --> 01:28:20,111
This is all thanks to you...

1405
01:28:21,673 --> 01:28:23,859
Ji Hyo... remain alive, okay?

1406
01:28:26,477 --> 01:28:30,382
[Go Soo, out!]

1407
01:28:31,921 --> 01:28:35,408
[Hyo Joo coming onto the scene
one step too late.]

1408
01:28:35,409 --> 01:28:38,728
[Only person she has left to
rely on now is Ji Hyo...]

1409
01:28:46,132 --> 01:28:48,650
[Where is everyone?]

1410
01:28:51,393 --> 01:28:52,766
Ji Hyo!

1411
01:28:52,767 --> 01:28:55,873
[Finally meeting up with Ji Hyo...]

1412
01:28:57,078 --> 01:29:00,148
Go Soo and I looked everywhere for you.
Where have you been?

1413
01:29:05,379 --> 01:29:08,967
[King Grasshopper slowly
starting his attack.]

1414
01:29:08,968 --> 01:29:10,298
What are you doing?

1415
01:29:10,829 --> 01:29:12,422
Go! Go away for now!

1416
01:29:12,423 --> 01:29:14,710
[The two still working together.]

1417
01:29:19,188 --> 01:29:20,902
You're scaring me! You're too fast!

1418
01:29:23,131 --> 01:29:28,139
[Going back to the last spot she
and her warrior were together.]

1419
01:29:28,420 --> 01:29:30,070
Ji Hyo, let's do it together.

1420
01:29:31,341 --> 01:29:33,106
- Ji Hyo, let's...
- Wait.

1421
01:29:33,107 --> 01:29:37,862
I want to meet my death at the spot
where my warrior met his fate.

1422
01:29:37,863 --> 01:29:40,725
[If that's your wish...]

1423
01:29:40,726 --> 01:29:42,991
I will not forget your grace...

1424
01:29:42,992 --> 01:29:44,916
- Thanks for everything.
- You're driving me crazy.

1425
01:29:44,917 --> 01:29:49,396
[Queen who's already given up hope.]

1426
01:29:49,397 --> 01:29:52,991
I want to remind you that it was us and Gary
who put you on that throne in the first place!

1427
01:29:52,992 --> 01:29:57,195
- Seriously...
- I will not forget your grace.

1428
01:29:57,196 --> 01:29:58,591
Just go.

1429
01:29:58,592 --> 01:30:03,706
[Even Hyo Joo who rallied to the end
is ultimately ousted!]

1430
01:30:08,244 --> 01:30:12,733
[And the final two left remaining...]

1431
01:30:12,734 --> 01:30:18,282
I will consider your faith and loyalty
that's served me until now...

1432
01:30:18,283 --> 01:30:21,597
- and I will give you 20 seconds head start.
- Okay, give me just 20 seconds.

1433
01:30:21,598 --> 01:30:24,842
- I cannot allow you any more time than that.
- I understand.

1434
01:30:24,843 --> 01:30:26,825
Keep that in mind and...

1435
01:30:29,189 --> 01:30:31,484
and don't consider me too cruel.

1436
01:30:32,187 --> 01:30:33,768
I am honored.

1437
01:30:35,117 --> 01:30:36,710
- Go on.
- I'm honored.

1438
01:30:45,414 --> 01:30:47,633
Song Ji Hyo's not an easy opponent...

1439
01:30:50,527 --> 01:30:52,457
No way... how many seconds
has it been?

1440
01:30:53,584 --> 01:30:55,471
No way...

1441
01:30:55,472 --> 01:30:57,309
No way!

1442
01:30:58,888 --> 01:31:04,390
[Just one possibility that King Grasshopper
hadn't thought of!]

1443
01:31:11,215 --> 01:31:12,423
No way!

1444
01:31:12,424 --> 01:31:13,728
No way!

1445
01:31:13,729 --> 01:31:16,462
No way could she have had
a ballot on her!

1446
01:31:17,368 --> 01:31:19,263
No way!

1447
01:31:19,264 --> 01:31:20,484
No way!

1448
01:31:21,695 --> 01:31:24,810
[Could she really be inside the
voting booth?]

1449
01:31:26,179 --> 01:31:28,068
- You scoundrel!
- I'm writing!

1450
01:31:28,069 --> 01:31:31,912
I'm writing!
You can't touch me while I'm voting!

1451
01:31:31,913 --> 01:31:34,248
[Rule: Not allowed to touch anyone
while the person is in the voting booth.]

1452
01:31:34,248 --> 01:31:36,930
[How can this be?]

1453
01:31:38,375 --> 01:31:44,283
[In truth, way in the beginning,
Blank Ji discovered a ballot.]

1454
01:31:44,284 --> 01:31:49,348
[Just in case,
she kept the ballot hidden until now!]

1455
01:31:51,356 --> 01:31:54,420
- Why you traitor...
- You can't touch me right now!

1456
01:31:54,421 --> 01:31:58,245
Song Ji Hyo had a ballot!
You deceitful traitor!

1457
01:31:58,246 --> 01:32:00,039
How could you have deceived me?

1458
01:32:00,040 --> 01:32:04,553
You can't see who I voted for!

1459
01:32:05,513 --> 01:32:07,250
Okay, a secret vote...

1460
01:32:07,251 --> 01:32:12,730
- I will let you cast your vote in secret.
- However, your time on the throne is over.

1461
01:32:12,731 --> 01:32:15,335
- I knew I couldn't trust you!
- How dare you set foot in here?

1462
01:32:15,336 --> 01:32:17,293
I will not let you get away
with this, Song Ji Hyo!

1463
01:32:17,294 --> 01:32:18,802
You only have a minute left
until you have to get back to work.

1464
01:32:18,803 --> 01:32:20,650
Be quiet, Go Dong Wan!

1465
01:32:20,651 --> 01:32:23,418
What have you been all this time
to just appear now?

1466
01:32:23,419 --> 01:32:27,130
When my reign is about end here and now,
you dare say to me...

1467
01:32:27,131 --> 01:32:29,381
[King Grasshopper at a loss of words...]

1468
01:32:29,382 --> 01:32:31,003
I've been completely fooled.

1469
01:32:31,004 --> 01:32:34,481
I've been fooled, I've been fooled,
Song Ji Hyo...

1470
01:32:35,939 --> 01:32:38,423
You deceitful Song Ji Hyo...

1471
01:32:38,424 --> 01:32:41,398
[Having no other choice but to go
and see to the affairs as a King...]

1472
01:32:41,399 --> 01:32:43,743
Your Majesty, have a safe trip back!

1473
01:32:48,058 --> 01:32:50,135
Looked at how well I stamped it!

1474
01:32:50,136 --> 01:32:53,037
[Ji Hyo completes voting for herself!]

1475
01:32:54,459 --> 01:32:56,998
<i>Cease all activities.
Cease all activities.</i>

1476
01:32:56,999 --> 01:32:59,149
<i>The voting poll is now closed.</i>

1477
01:33:00,887 --> 01:33:03,194
<i>The next King that Running Man
kingdom has chosen is...</i>

1478
01:33:03,195 --> 01:33:04,885
<i>Song Ji Hyo.</i>
