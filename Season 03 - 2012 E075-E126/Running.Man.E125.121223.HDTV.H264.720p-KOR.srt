- Why are you doing this to us?

67
00:04:13,663 --> 00:04:15,234
Why are there so many fatties here
as our guests today?

68
00:04:15,235 --> 00:04:18,289
What do you mean, fatties,
you scoundrel? Fatties?

69
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:20,527
I should just throw all of you
down onto the ground!

00:04:20,528 --> 00:04:22,315
Hey, should we show them?

71
00:04:22,316 --> 00:04:24,235
Show them what?

72
00:04:24,236 --> 00:04:25,603
[Show them what?]

73
00:04:25,604 --> 00:04:28,429
What are you going to show us when you're
already tired from coming down the steps?

- Yes?

I thought that you were chubby,
but you're actually very slim.

all of us here today.

00:04:36,938 --> 00:04:40,506
[But...]

78
00:04:40,507 --> 00:04:44,520

[The master of Hongdae, Juvie Train.]

81
00:04:54,741 --> 00:04:56,324
I thought you were one
of these guys' managers.]

82
00:04:58,454 --> 00:05:02,123
The top performer in Hongdae...
still clubbing even after you got married.

83
00:05:02,124 --> 00:05:03,316
How dare you!

84
00:05:05,743 --> 00:05:08,696

00:05:15,094 --> 00:05:17,226
[But this is Running Man...]

88
00:05:17,227 --> 00:05:18,753
This is Running Man!

89
00:05:21,002 --> 00:05:23,289
- Give it a rest.
- Just leave him alone.

90
00:05:24,327 --> 00:05:27,484
[Finishing off by throwing
his arms up into the air.]

91
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:29,943
Isn't Hyung Don really funny?

92
00:05:29,944 --> 00:05:31,552
He tells Jong Kook that he's only
Kim Jong Kook on Running Man

93
00:05:31,553 --> 00:05:32,796
when this show is Running Man.

94
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:35,663
[Oh yeah...]

95
00:05:35,664 --> 00:05:37,800
I think Hyung Don was confused
for a moment.

96
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,524
I think he mistook this show
for a Saturday night show.

97
00:05:39,525 --> 00:05:42,400
[This is Running Man with Kang Gary,
whom he wishes he could have.]

98
00:05:42,742 --> 00:05:46,224
Wait, everyone... stop stepping up
to just look around at the scenery.

99
00:05:46,225 --> 00:05:48,318
Step back into your spot.

100
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:50,996
Just look at how
they're staring at you right now.

101
00:05:50,997 --> 00:05:53,542
[Staring at them as if they're looking
at something wondrous.]

102
00:05:53,542 --> 00:05:55,598
They're staring at us like
they're looking at celebrities.

103
00:05:55,599 --> 00:05:57,449
They're looking at us like they're
seeing celebrities for the first time.

104
00:05:57,450 --> 00:05:59,706
Hyung Don...
just stay quiet until you have to leave.

105
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:04,518
- In front of all these people?
- I'll just see you Saturday.

106
00:06:05,518 --> 00:06:10,149
Anyways, these five guests that are here...
they're here on Running Man.

107
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:12,725
More than anything else,
I think it's going to be a lot of fun.

108
00:06:12,726 --> 00:06:17,999
The writers didn't tell me who the other
guests were going to be when I asked.

109
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,120
- And I was the first one to arrive...
- Yes, but what?

110
00:06:21,121 --> 00:06:24,003
And when I started seeing them arrive one
by one, they all pretty much looked the same!

111
00:06:24,004 --> 00:06:25,840
[All the friends that started to arrive
we're all pretty much in a similar shape?]

112
00:06:25,841 --> 00:06:28,029
That's when I realized,
'Ah, this must be the special today'!

113
00:06:28,416 --> 00:06:31,727
- And what is this special?
- You know what this special is!

114
00:06:31,728 --> 00:06:33,903
- And what is that?
- This kind of a special.

115
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:37,266
That's how I knew
what kind of a special this is.

116
00:06:38,376 --> 00:06:42,261
<i>Today's Christmas special is...
Snow fight race.</i>

117
00:06:42,262 --> 00:06:44,287
[Christmas special - Snow fight race.]

118
00:06:44,288 --> 00:06:46,663
<i>I'm going to give you a snowball
each time you finish a race.</i>

119
00:06:46,664 --> 00:06:48,643
What kind of an evil game is this?

120
00:06:48,644 --> 00:06:50,008
[Conclude the missions that are
placed throughout the ski lodge.]

121
00:06:50,008 --> 00:06:53,592
[At the end of each race, they will be given
snowballs depending on where they placed.]

122
00:06:55,727 --> 00:06:59,172
<i>The team that wins the final snow fight at
the final location is the ultimate winner.</i>

123
00:06:59,429 --> 00:07:02,695
<i>For the first time in a long time
for this Christmas special...</i>

124
00:07:02,696 --> 00:07:06,263
<i>the team that comes in last will have
to face a severe penalty.</i>

125
00:07:06,264 --> 00:07:09,248
- Wow, we haven't seen that in a long time!
- I really don't want to have to face it!

126
00:07:11,104 --> 00:07:14,529
[A festival of men in long johns gliding
over the snowy hilltops.]

127
00:07:14,529 --> 00:07:17,688
[This is the penalty that awaits the
team that comes in last today.]

128
00:07:17,689 --> 00:07:19,804
<i>So I hope that all of you put
in your best effort today.</i>

129
00:07:19,805 --> 00:07:22,246
- But, Kwang Soo...
- Yes?

130
00:07:22,247 --> 00:07:24,358
- I bet you're really comfortable today.
- Why?

131
00:07:24,359 --> 00:07:26,135
You have Hyung Don to take
over your role today.

132
00:07:26,135 --> 00:07:27,735
That's why I have nothing to say today!

133
00:07:28,958 --> 00:07:31,969
[Giraffe in danger of losing his role
that's taken him two years to cultivate.]

134
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:34,124
I'm better at things like this than he is!

135
00:07:34,489 --> 00:07:36,124
Get out of here!

136
00:07:37,077 --> 00:07:39,954
[Giraffe being disgraced.]

137
00:07:48,138 --> 00:07:50,100
[Merry Christmas...]

138
00:07:52,559 --> 00:07:55,646
[Snow fight race - Start!]

139
00:07:58,765 --> 00:08:01,736
[Yellow Team: Jong Kook, Ha Ha,
Ryu Dam and Juvie Train.]

140
00:08:01,737 --> 00:08:03,471
- Do we have to get on this?
- This is so cool!

141
00:08:04,888 --> 00:08:07,637
- In one row?
- How can we all fit in the same row?

142
00:08:11,917 --> 00:08:13,361
This is such a tight squeeze!

143
00:08:14,721 --> 00:08:16,714
- This is too tight!
- This is too tight of a fit!

144
00:08:16,715 --> 00:08:19,145
- Seriously...
- Sang Myun...

145
00:08:19,146 --> 00:08:21,976
- We succeeded!
- Our team succeeded the mission!

146
00:08:21,977 --> 00:08:24,032
We all fit in the same row!

147
00:08:35,361 --> 00:08:36,656
Are we on the show for two weeks?

148
00:08:36,657 --> 00:08:38,627
Why don't you just worry about
this week?

149
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:43,248
- Just worry about this week!
- You guys are total scammers!

150
00:08:45,682 --> 00:08:48,970
I was really shocked to see you come
on our Christmas special show.

151
00:08:48,971 --> 00:08:51,819
[I bet Hyung Don is feeling
pretty much the same?]

152
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:53,723
It's been eight years...

153
00:08:54,081 --> 00:08:56,792
Eight years since I've made
an appearance on a Sunday program.

154
00:08:56,793 --> 00:08:58,606
Then why did you come out?
You should've just stayed home instead.

155
00:09:01,185 --> 00:09:04,116
- Ugh, it's so tight... so tight!
- It's tight because of you.

156
00:09:04,633 --> 00:09:06,576
Let's move it!

157
00:09:08,951 --> 00:09:10,460
I feel like I'm suffocating here.

158
00:09:10,461 --> 00:09:13,051
[This much weight is a first
for the little train too.]

159
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:15,376
Why did we even get on this train
if we're going to be moving so slow like this?

160
00:09:16,022 --> 00:09:17,965
Because it's still faster than you guys.

161
00:09:17,966 --> 00:09:19,369
[Bingo?]

162
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:22,379
- It's giving you a ride.
- No, this is nice to get a ride.

163
00:09:23,684 --> 00:09:28,297
<i>I never knew a place like this existed
so close to Seoul like this.</i>

164
00:09:28,297 --> 00:09:30,266
I know...
only an hour away from Seoul.

165
00:09:30,267 --> 00:09:31,394
[Blue Team taking in
the beautiful sights of scenery.]

166
00:09:31,717 --> 00:09:33,674
[Now off to the slopes!]

167
00:09:34,964 --> 00:09:37,666
[The blinding snow.]

168
00:09:40,511 --> 00:09:42,334
What is that?
I see a flag over there?

169
00:09:43,269 --> 00:09:44,598
- Over there.
- Where?

170
00:09:44,599 --> 00:09:49,869
[In the midst of the white slopes...
a single flag flying in the breeze...]

171
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:52,990
<i>Even though you're all wearing the
same clothes, the difference in your size...</i>

172
00:09:56,004 --> 00:09:57,907
You have two layers of coat on, don't you?

173
00:09:57,908 --> 00:10:00,007
[Suspecting them to be wearing
a second layer of outerwear?]

174
00:10:00,008 --> 00:10:02,391
Are you sure that Juvie isn't wearing
another coat over there?

175
00:10:02,997 --> 00:10:04,933
Sang Myun, how many layers of
clothing do you have on?

176
00:10:05,536 --> 00:10:08,059
- How many coats are you wearing? Seriously?
- I'm only wearing one coat.

177
00:10:10,635 --> 00:10:13,335
<i>Here's your first mission
for the snow fight race.</i>

178
00:10:13,336 --> 00:10:15,718
<i>The ultimate duo that you think of when
the word Christmas is mentioned...</i>

179
00:10:15,719 --> 00:10:18,370
<i>This is the Santa and Rudolph game.</i>

180
00:10:18,371 --> 00:10:20,658
<i>This will be two people per game.</i>

181
00:10:20,659 --> 00:10:23,624
<i>One person will be the Rudolph,
and the other one will be Santa.</i>

182
00:10:23,625 --> 00:10:26,320
<i>If you look up behind you,
you'll see the starting flag.</i>

183
00:10:26,321 --> 00:10:30,487
<i>Everyone will wait there,
until I give my signal.</i>

184
00:10:30,488 --> 00:10:34,217
<i>Do you all see the small cone that's
a little below the flag?</i>

185
00:10:34,218 --> 00:10:36,475
<i>You'll find that a sleigh is tied up
to the cone up there.</i>

186
00:10:36,476 --> 00:10:40,833
<i>You have to dig out the tube sleigh
and ride it down the slope together</i>

187
00:10:40,834 --> 00:10:46,185
<i>and Santa has to change into the Santa
stockings down below to win the game.</i>

188
00:10:46,677 --> 00:10:48,118
We have to change into the stocking?

189
00:10:48,119 --> 00:10:51,565
We have to take our shoes off to
change and put the shoes back on?

190
00:10:51,566 --> 00:10:54,271
You're really making all this
pretty annoying.

191
00:10:56,953 --> 00:10:59,579
[Inducing a vomiting reaction?]

192
00:10:59,579 --> 00:11:01,080
He's just trying to get some attention.

193
00:11:01,989 --> 00:11:05,378
[The meaning of his dry heaving
that's been caught by his friend.]

194
00:11:05,379 --> 00:11:08,218
I suddenly felt short of breath just from
thinking of having to walk up there.

195
00:11:08,673 --> 00:11:11,340
But... how can the Rudolph lead
the sleigh?

196
00:11:11,719 --> 00:11:14,267
Rudolph can ride up front
and Santa can ride in the back.

197
00:11:14,268 --> 00:11:16,658
Why don't you listen more carefully when
he's explaining the game to us?

198
00:11:16,659 --> 00:11:18,457
I'm listening to everything he's saying.

199
00:11:19,643 --> 00:11:22,892
- That's how we start?
- Then who's going to pull the sleigh?

200
00:11:23,411 --> 00:11:25,031
You can pull it! You!

201
00:11:26,398 --> 00:11:28,248
We told you, Rudolph gets up in the front!

202
00:11:28,859 --> 00:11:31,510
[A violent physical conversation
at every chance they get.]

203
00:11:35,352 --> 00:11:37,571
I was just lightly asking you...
lightly asking.

204
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,763
Why don't we all climb up there first?

205
00:11:42,425 --> 00:11:45,322
[Yellow Team moves up to the second round.
Red Team vs. Blue Team.]

206
00:11:45,323 --> 00:11:46,564
Kang Gary!

207
00:11:47,224 --> 00:11:48,932
<i>Kang Gary!</i>

208
00:11:50,303 --> 00:11:52,422
I can't believe I missed...

209
00:11:52,423 --> 00:11:55,044
Hey! Why are you trying to hit me?

210
00:12:00,782 --> 00:12:02,496
- What the heck?
- This slope is really steep.

211
00:12:02,497 --> 00:12:03,993
This isn't just snow!

212
00:12:06,468 --> 00:12:08,279
I'm already exhausted.

213
00:12:09,144 --> 00:12:12,959
- No, you're not exhausted... you can't be.
- But I'm... really tired.

214
00:12:15,315 --> 00:12:16,896
Fighting!

215
00:12:18,383 --> 00:12:19,843
[Red Team- Santa (Gary); Rudolph (Ji Hyo).]

216
00:12:19,844 --> 00:12:21,337

Rudolph (Kwang Soo).]

217
00:12:24,605 --> 00:12:27,624
<i>Set... go!</i>

218
00:12:28,577 --> 00:12:30,989
[Run!]

219
00:12:32,478 --> 00:12:34,243
Wait! Wait!

[Sprinting down the slope.]

221
00:12:40,343 --> 00:12:42,528
[Sliding down on their bellies.]

222
00:12:45,716 --> 00:12:48,274
[They need to dig out the tubes quickly!]

223
00:12:49,599 --> 00:12:51,858
[Swimming through the snow?]

224
00:12:52,714 --> 00:12:55,423
- Ji Hyo! Hurry!
- Hurry!

225
00:12:55,424 --> 00:12:56,673
[Ji Hyo and Gary succeeding on
digging up their tubes first.]

226
00:13:00,044 --> 00:13:02,504
[Gary and Ji Hyo are first
to head down the slopes!]

227
00:13:07,223 --> 00:13:09,754
[Isn't it fast?]

228
00:13:11,213 --> 00:13:15,066
[Coming down the slope!]

229
00:13:31,542 --> 00:13:33,621
- Hurry up!
- What's taking you so long?

230
00:13:33,622 --> 00:13:36,203
[Giraffe and Rudolph going
at the slowest speed.]

231
00:13:37,479 --> 00:13:41,799
[Now the Santas just have to change into
the stockings and pull out the flag!]

232
00:13:43,589 --> 00:13:45,988
[What? A drop kick?]

233
00:13:48,861 --> 00:13:51,575
[Santa Shin Dong stealing the stockings!]

[What? Barefoot?]

237
00:14:10,506 --> 00:14:11,957
Take off your shoes!

238
00:14:14,535 --> 00:14:16,642
[A full on chase in the snow
while barefoot.]

239
00:14:23,437 --> 00:14:25,361

finally off.]

[Revenge.]

back in his possession.]

[Rudolph Kwang Soo's attack keeps
getting more forceful.]

251
00:15:20,846 --> 00:15:22,534

Give it to me!

255

[Definitely our Ace Ji Hyo.
Taking on two of them at once.]

257

Wow! It's two against one!
Two against one!

258
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:48,419
- You're making this difficult!
- Sorry... please don't do this!

259
00:15:52,453 --> 00:15:53,977
Just throw it to me!

260
00:15:54,569 --> 00:15:56,186

Get away from him!

270

- My hands are frozen.
- Are you a gazelle?

the mountain to help out the human beings?]

Are you sure you're not a gazelle?

276
00:16:46,632 --> 00:16:48,177
What do you mean, a gazelle?

277
00:16:48,615 --> 00:16:50,831

- You really are so high maintenance!
- Why can't you put it on yourself?

281
00:17:00,544 --> 00:17:02,175
I can't put it on myself...

282
00:17:02,176 --> 00:17:04,384
I normally can't put socks on
by myself...

283
00:17:06,048 --> 00:17:09,732

who can't even put socks on by himself.]

about all this snow?]

- You can't get them separated!
- Slow... slow down.

307

[Easy Brothers' finally gets on their way.]

504
00:32:15,531 --> 00:32:16,910
<i>Careful! Be careful.</i>

505
00:32:16,911 --> 00:32:19,982
[Always heading down towards
the same direction...]

506
00:32:22,385 --> 00:32:23,452
Put it on... put it on.

507
00:32:23,453 --> 00:32:24,704
Here, put the other one on.

508
00:32:25,536 --> 00:32:27,597
[No way he'd leave them alone...]

509
00:32:30,813 --> 00:32:33,814
[Predicting total chaos to ensue
with Kwang Soo's interference.]

510
00:32:34,388 --> 00:32:35,576
Let go. Let go!

511
00:32:43,826 --> 00:32:46,330
[This guy, who will stoop to any lows...]

512
00:32:46,912 --> 00:32:48,586
Pass it back to me.

513
00:32:51,794 --> 00:32:53,345
I don't know whose feet are whose!

514
00:32:53,346 --> 00:32:54,757
Whose foot is this?

515
00:32:55,255 --> 00:32:57,720
[In a contorted martial arts position.]

516
00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:01,130
My foot is this one!

517
00:33:01,736 --> 00:33:03,490
That's not my foot!

518
00:33:03,491 --> 00:33:05,367
Are you just giving up like that?

519
00:33:05,368 --> 00:33:06,436
[Will the Yellow Team win?]

520
00:33:07,886 --> 00:33:10,693
[Juvie has both stockings on his feet!]

521
00:33:12,978 --> 00:33:15,775
[Heading towards the flag!]

522
00:33:20,258 --> 00:33:22,907
[The flag not getting pulled out easily.]

523
00:33:27,787 --> 00:33:30,235
[Giraffe using that time to
steal a stocking.]

524
00:33:32,342 --> 00:33:33,618
[Trips him over.]

525
00:33:36,526 --> 00:33:38,026
[Still unsure of what's going on.]

526
00:33:43,668 --> 00:33:48,556
[If I can't steal the stockings...]

527
00:33:48,556 --> 00:33:51,334
[Huh? Where are they headed?]

528
00:33:54,653 --> 00:33:58,347
[Running barefoot through the
snowy meadow...]

529
00:33:59,734 --> 00:34:03,486
[Juvie and the Giraffe continuing
with their runaround.]

530
00:34:03,486 --> 00:34:08,437
[Shocking spin they're taking
barefoot in the snow.]

531
00:34:09,879 --> 00:34:12,747
[Juvie going along on the run without
even knowing the reason behind it...]

532
00:34:16,086 --> 00:34:17,538
Suk Jin! Hurry up and
steal the stockings!

533
00:34:17,539 --> 00:34:18,900
Hurry up and take it from him!

534
00:34:18,901 --> 00:34:20,705
My feet are freezing!

535
00:34:25,090 --> 00:34:28,649
[Ro-Ro running to Juvie's side after having
held onto the stockings all this time.]

536
00:34:34,135 --> 00:34:36,570
[Big-nosed Brother helping to get
the stockings on Juvie's feet.]

537
00:34:44,819 --> 00:34:48,040
[What everyone wants is not the victory,
but for the game to end quickly.]

538
00:34:51,419 --> 00:34:53,778
[Yellow Team wins!]

539
00:34:56,332 --> 00:35:00,048
So cold... so cold.
I don't think I can do this anymore.

540
00:35:00,049 --> 00:35:02,176
[No longer allowed to frolic
through the snow anymore...]

541
00:35:03,411 --> 00:35:05,590
Yellow Team wins!

542
00:35:05,591 --> 00:35:07,879
[Yellow Team wins the
Santa and the Rudolph game!]

543
00:35:10,271 --> 00:35:14,082
<i>Yellow Team takes the win
for our first game today.</i>

544
00:35:14,083 --> 00:35:17,964
[Yellow Team to take the win.]

545
00:35:17,964 --> 00:35:22,714
[Four snowballs given out to
the Yellow Team for winning the game.]

546
00:35:22,715 --> 00:35:25,025
[Blue Team gets two snowballs
for coming in at second place.]

547
00:35:25,025 --> 00:35:27,636
[Red Team gets zero snowballs
for coming in at last place.]

548
00:35:35,554 --> 00:35:38,587
[Second mission location-
A swimming pool in the snowy lodge.]

549
00:35:38,587 --> 00:35:40,502
<i>Hot... this feels hot.</i>

550
00:35:41,069 --> 00:35:42,711
<i>The water is mine.</i>

551
00:35:43,089 --> 00:35:46,146
[Sang Myun feeling confident
over water?]

552
00:35:46,146 --> 00:35:48,206
I can swim like a fish.

553
00:35:48,994 --> 00:35:52,364
Jong Kook...
did you bring your mother here?

554
00:35:52,365 --> 00:35:55,439
[Kkuk here on a vacation with
his mother?]

555
00:35:56,295 --> 00:36:01,292
<i>This mission takes place in the pool,
and it's called 'Christmas in the summer'.</i>

556
00:36:01,293 --> 00:36:03,965
- They're so clever with their ideas...
- That's a good name they came up with.

557
00:36:03,965 --> 00:36:05,732
That has a bit of romanticism to it.

558
00:36:05,733 --> 00:36:09,175
<i>If you look behind you,
you'll see a balance beam in the pool.</i>

559
00:36:09,175 --> 00:36:10,820
I bet we have to get up on that thing.

560
00:36:10,821 --> 00:36:12,580
<i>All four members of the team
will have to get up on the beam.</i>

561
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:17,858
<i>So when I call out the numbers,
number one will have to move number four spot.</i>

562
00:36:17,859 --> 00:36:19,819
<i>And number two will have to move
down to that person's spot.</i>

563
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:22,203
- We have to move our spots?
- You have to change your spots in this game.

564
00:36:22,204 --> 00:36:24,970
<i>The allotted time you will have...
is one minute.</i>

565
00:36:24,971 --> 00:36:27,947
It's hard enough to do that
while just standing here.

566
00:36:27,948 --> 00:36:30,050
How are we supposed to get past him?

567
00:36:30,856 --> 00:36:33,654
- Why don't you try moving over here?
- It's not going to work because of this!

568
00:36:33,655 --> 00:36:35,414
What are you saying is wrong with it?

569
00:36:35,415 --> 00:36:36,952
Why don't you try, Ji Hyo?

570
00:36:37,752 --> 00:36:40,160
[Just like this...]

571
00:36:43,502 --> 00:36:47,197
But I... normally can't even walk
straight on regular streets.

572
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:50,955
So how am I supposed to walk on
such a narrow thing like that?

573
00:36:52,622 --> 00:36:56,394
<i>We'll start with the Yellow Team
since they won the previous game.</i>

574
00:36:56,395 --> 00:36:57,595
[Yellow Team to start off the game
from having won the first game.]

575
00:36:57,596 --> 00:36:58,981
The water is nice and warm!

576
00:37:04,756 --> 00:37:07,325
[Hyung Don in the water...]

577
00:37:07,326 --> 00:37:10,089
<i>As I've mentioned to you before,
you've only got one minute.</i>

578
00:37:10,090 --> 00:37:12,527
<i>Are you all ready?
We're going to start right away.</i>

579
00:37:12,528 --> 00:37:15,170
That's really tight.
It's tight just from even looking at it.

580
00:37:15,752 --> 00:37:17,724
[Looking especially cramped for these two.]

581
00:37:20,406 --> 00:37:21,999
Do you think you can even climb up here?

582
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:26,581
Do you think you can even climb up here?

583
00:37:26,582 --> 00:37:28,128
<i>I don't think they can climb up there.</i>

584
00:37:33,377 --> 00:37:35,350
[Belly getting in the way...]

585
00:37:41,515 --> 00:37:43,232
What are you doing right now?

586
00:37:43,233 --> 00:37:45,318
If you keep that up,
Jong Kook is going to scold you.

587
00:37:45,319 --> 00:37:48,752
There may be chieftains in the jungle,
but on Running Man, we have Jong Kook!

588
00:37:48,753 --> 00:37:50,736
Use your knees!
Use your knees to climb up here!

589
00:37:52,222 --> 00:37:53,907
[Unbelievable...]

590
00:37:53,908 --> 00:37:55,780
Stop frowning so much, Jong Kook.

591
00:37:58,925 --> 00:38:00,929
[Struggling to just even get up
on the beam.]

592
00:38:04,948 --> 00:38:07,232
- This isn't working!
- We're going to win this game.

593
00:38:09,688 --> 00:38:11,537
Use your knees to get up here!

594
00:38:13,688 --> 00:38:16,306
[Several times getting only his belly
up on the beam already.]

595
00:38:18,399 --> 00:38:20,361
That's right... your leg.
Pull up your leg now.

596
00:38:24,264 --> 00:38:26,354
[Time's up.]

597
00:38:26,835 --> 00:38:29,153
- Is it over?
- We haven't even gotten started!

598
00:38:29,997 --> 00:38:31,997
[Fails without even having all
the team members up on the beam.]

599
00:38:31,998 --> 00:38:33,511
He's like the sea lion.

600
00:38:35,731 --> 00:38:38,894
[I want to sit upon a rock
and just rest...]

601
00:38:38,895 --> 00:38:41,324
Dam... what happened?

602
00:38:43,089 --> 00:38:45,278
No way... that's not possible.

603
00:38:46,417 --> 00:38:48,628
[Blue Team's turn at the challenge.]

604
00:38:57,769 --> 00:38:58,994
It's not easy!

605
00:39:00,249 --> 00:39:02,837
[Big-nosed Brother not being able
to get his body to cooperate.]

606
00:39:09,652 --> 00:39:12,849
[Sang Myun, first to make a move...]

607
00:39:16,518 --> 00:39:18,955
[Throwing him off?]

608
00:39:18,955 --> 00:39:20,450
That felt too weird!

609
00:39:23,115 --> 00:39:25,498
[Everyone ultimately falls
into the water.]

610
00:39:25,499 --> 00:39:27,829
How can you just throw me into the
water like that because it felt weird?

611
00:39:32,557 --> 00:39:34,720
[Making another attempt.]

612
00:39:38,441 --> 00:39:40,590
Hold on...
everyone, just hold on to me.

613
00:39:40,591 --> 00:39:42,018
You need to hold on to me too.

614
00:39:42,019 --> 00:39:44,621
[Why is everyone getting angry?]

615
00:39:47,786 --> 00:39:49,987
[Finally passes by one person.]

616
00:39:49,988 --> 00:39:51,733
This isn't too hard.

617
00:39:52,007 --> 00:39:55,027
[Sang Myun and Big-nosed Brother
making a move simultaneously.]

618
00:39:55,028 --> 00:39:57,637
That really does feel weird.

619
00:40:00,265 --> 00:40:03,673
[Just how will Shin Dong...]

620
00:40:12,165 --> 00:40:15,511
[Unable to work around the bulk...]

621
00:40:15,512 --> 00:40:17,269
[Fail]

622
00:40:19,474 --> 00:40:21,080
This isn't going to work...

623
00:40:23,073 --> 00:40:25,092
Oh my stomach...

624
00:40:25,093 --> 00:40:27,452
[Hurting the stomach of the bystanders
from making them laugh so hard.]

625
00:40:27,453 --> 00:40:29,596
How much time do we have to
get this done?

626
00:40:29,731 --> 00:40:32,937
[We told you that you only had
a minute just a little while ago...]

627
00:40:34,607 --> 00:40:39,041
[Everyone getting together
to start practicing.]

628
00:40:40,758 --> 00:40:44,689
[Red Team feeling disappointed
from their disinterest.]

629
00:40:44,689 --> 00:40:47,083
[Aqua ballet dancing team..]

630
00:40:49,034 --> 00:40:51,046
This team is pretty slim.

631
00:40:56,498 --> 00:40:59,467
[Feeling too reassured because
of their slimness.]

632
00:41:08,502 --> 00:41:12,381
[Slim Team? Moving at a fast speed.]

633
00:41:12,971 --> 00:41:15,882
[Easily passing by skinny Ji Hyo.]

634
00:41:16,662 --> 00:41:20,134
[Oh? Passes by Hyung Don too?]

635
00:41:20,844 --> 00:41:23,045
[Gary starting to make his move
right away!]

636
00:41:23,046 --> 00:41:24,826
[A strange atmosphere?]

637
00:41:24,826 --> 00:41:26,487
Are you two dating?

638
00:41:26,488 --> 00:41:28,634
I want to go through that again!

639
00:41:28,635 --> 00:41:30,015
Hurry up!

640
00:41:36,255 --> 00:41:38,693
[A hot embrace.]

641
00:41:43,286 --> 00:41:46,513
[Red Team's chance at a win in danger!]

642
00:41:51,943 --> 00:41:53,357
Okay, got it. Got it.

643
00:41:56,838 --> 00:41:58,170
Okay, Ji Hyo!

644
00:41:59,199 --> 00:42:02,650
[Slim Ji Hyo passes through them
quickly with ease.]

645
00:42:05,149 --> 00:42:07,227
[And lastly, it's Hyung Don's turn.]

646
00:42:08,481 --> 00:42:10,344
- I don't think I can make it...
- You can do it!

647
00:42:11,294 --> 00:42:12,656
Get yourself together!

648
00:42:13,871 --> 00:42:15,255
Hurry!

649
00:42:20,247 --> 00:42:22,595
[Time's up]

650
00:42:23,324 --> 00:42:25,055
[Slim Team almost made it to victory...]

651
00:42:25,056 --> 00:42:28,791
[Yellow Team's plan is to get
Dam up on the beam first?]

652
00:42:28,792 --> 00:42:30,262
<i>Are you all ready?</i>

653
00:42:30,263 --> 00:42:32,429
There's no way they can get it
done with Dam.

654
00:42:37,993 --> 00:42:39,708
<i>He's going to fall, he's going to fall!</i>

655
00:42:40,549 --> 00:42:43,290
[Succeeds in getting Dam up
on the beam as planned.]

656
00:42:47,903 --> 00:42:50,878
[Got everyone up on the
balance beam.]

657
00:42:50,879 --> 00:42:53,487
Get down... lower yourself, Dam.

658
00:42:55,034 --> 00:42:56,650
Lower yourself to pass.

659
00:42:59,364 --> 00:43:01,692
[Halfway to victory as long as
they can get Dam to pass through.]

660
00:43:01,692 --> 00:43:03,160
[And today's main event!]

661
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:08,393
[Ryu Dam and Juvie Train are
about to pass one another!]

662
00:43:10,762 --> 00:43:13,552
Quickly! Do it quickly!

663
00:43:13,553 --> 00:43:15,348
[Total chaos ensues.]

664
00:43:19,354 --> 00:43:21,138
[- Hold your breath.
-You too.]

665
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:25,481
[Are these two dancing the waltz?]

666
00:43:31,586 --> 00:43:34,698
[Convulsing with laughter.]

667
00:43:36,550 --> 00:43:41,199
[Ryu Dam and Juvie having become
one belly to belly.]

668
00:43:46,577 --> 00:43:48,866
[Ultimately falling into the water together.]

669
00:43:51,059 --> 00:43:54,490
[Causing a small wave pool by
falling into the water.]

670
00:44:01,409 --> 00:44:04,176
[Like a piece of seaweed
floating in the water.]

671
00:44:04,177 --> 00:44:06,707
Now that I've gotten to know Juvie a bit,
I realized that he's guilty of a crime.

672
00:44:07,763 --> 00:44:11,041
[My crime is always having a full belly...]

673
00:44:11,042 --> 00:44:13,265
Juvie is cracking me up!

674
00:44:14,315 --> 00:44:16,377
- It's G-Dragon!
- He looks likes G-Dragon!

675
00:44:17,251 --> 00:44:18,652
G-Dragon!

676
00:44:19,014 --> 00:44:21,345
[I'm Juvie-Dragon.]

677
00:44:24,658 --> 00:44:27,317
Dam and Juvie together is hilarious!

678
00:44:27,318 --> 00:44:30,293
[The birth of a new comedic duo!
Ryu Dam and Juvie Train.]

679
00:44:30,294 --> 00:44:32,200
I should've gained some more weight
before I came on the show.

680
00:44:32,201 --> 00:44:34,659
You really are very slim these days.

681
00:44:34,863 --> 00:44:37,145
[If you think you can catch up to me,
give it a try.]

682
00:44:38,099 --> 00:44:40,195
[Blue Team's turn.]

683
00:44:48,042 --> 00:44:52,176
[Blue Team showing off some
new moves.]

684
00:44:55,735 --> 00:45:00,150
[Shin Dong's strong skills.
Lifting them up and moving them aside!]

685
00:45:01,312 --> 00:45:04,400
That's your biggest hurdle!
You move him, then we can win this.

686
00:45:07,790 --> 00:45:10,002
[Going back to his original stance.]

687
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:14,804
[Shin Dong now has to move Sang Myun.]

688
00:45:14,805 --> 00:45:17,263

[Blue Team in good spirits.]

690
00:45:24,223 --> 00:45:27,091
[20 seconds left on the clock!]

691
00:45:27,092 --> 00:45:32,327
[Will the Blue Team be able to feel
the joy of winning?]

692
00:45:32,327 --> 00:45:34,148
[Second person,
Kwang Soo also passes through!]

693
00:45:34,148 --> 00:45:36,316
[No way...]

694
00:45:38,348 --> 00:45:43,137
[If only Big-nosed Brother
can pass through...]

695
00:45:45,889 --> 00:45:49,861
[Huh? There's no room for him to go to?]

696
00:45:57,905 --> 00:45:59,895
[Spot on comedic move.]

697
00:46:03,141 --> 00:46:05,241
[Why do these things always
happen to this guy...]

698
00:46:05,241 --> 00:46:06,640
[Sorry.]

699
00:46:07,593 --> 00:46:08,755
This is why I do variety shows!

700
00:46:11,274 --> 00:46:14,394
[This is the reason why the nation's MC,
Jae Suk can't quit doing variety shows!]

701
00:46:14,395 --> 00:46:17,012
- This is what variety show is all about!
- This is what variety show is all about!

702
00:46:17,013 --> 00:46:19,248
- This is what it's all about!
- That was exciting!

703
00:46:19,249 --> 00:46:21,085
That was sweet!

704
00:46:21,086 --> 00:46:22,770
That was just delightful!

705
00:46:24,866 --> 00:46:27,580
[Easy Brothers' piling on
the laughter for Christmas.]

706
00:46:27,581 --> 00:46:28,981
Should I go first?

707
00:46:28,982 --> 00:46:31,370
[Red Team follows up with their turn.]

708
00:46:42,538 --> 00:46:44,039
I don't think I can do it.

709
00:46:45,452 --> 00:46:48,216
- Get yourself together!
- You can do it!

710
00:46:50,403 --> 00:46:52,897
There's no place for me to set
my foot down!

711
00:46:52,898 --> 00:46:56,160
- Right here!
- Where am I supposed to step?

712
00:46:57,855 --> 00:46:59,630
- Hurry up!
- Get yourself together!

713
00:46:59,631 --> 00:47:01,982
[When they're already running
low on time...]

714
00:47:01,983 --> 00:47:04,300
[Giving it another try after
checking for some room.]

715
00:47:04,301 --> 00:47:06,109
Hurry! Get yourself together!

716
00:47:06,110 --> 00:47:07,565

[Easily passing by slim Ji Hyo once again.]

720

[Will this succeed this time around?]

721
00:47:34,354 --> 00:47:38,145
[Monday couple also getting plunged
into the water amicably.]

722
00:47:38,605 --> 00:47:40,342

water on purpose?

723
00:47:44,634 --> 00:47:46,887

just from the thought of them alone.]

will they give us this time?]

726
00:47:55,257 --> 00:47:56,592

- No, they can't make a move.
- They both have to move together.

737

Suck in your stomach a little!

738
00:48:37,290 --> 00:48:40,416
Both of you, suck in your stomach!

739
00:48:40,417 --> 00:48:42,495
Why don't you try moving
your foot over?

740
00:48:43,575 --> 00:48:46,491
[Huh? Taking the pose of a cobra?]

741

[Blue Team's turn once again.]

746
00:49:14,731 --> 00:49:18,823
[What does the Blue Team's Brain,
Shin Dong have up in his sleeve this time?]

747
00:49:22,402 --> 00:49:23,682
It's a new method again.

748
00:49:30,253 --> 00:49:32,929
[Plan is to climb over
the person sitting down.]

749
00:49:33,784 --> 00:49:36,384

already succeeded in passing two people.]

750

[Now if only Sang Myun can
pass through...]

751
00:49:44,822 --> 00:49:47,994

Sang Myun and Shin Dong.]

752
00:49:53,150 --> 00:49:55,258
[Climbing back up to give it another go!]

753
00:49:55,258 --> 00:49:57,563

[Sang Myun getting crushed
under Shin Dong.]

barely get passed!]

757
00:50:20,510 --> 00:50:24,109
[Everyone falls into the water
no thanks to Sang Myun's move.]

758
00:50:24,110 --> 00:50:25,731

who's favored for the win!]

faster than any other team!]

[Jae Suk passes by
two people in the blink of an eye!]

765
00:50:57,837 --> 00:50:59,258
[This isn't going to work.]

766
00:51:00,584 --> 00:51:02,590
[Passing Hyung Don
through the front this time.]

767
00:51:05,231 --> 00:51:06,619

Are you posing for a picture?</i>

768
00:51:08,244 --> 00:51:12,488
[A sexy couple pose for the picture.]

[Second one making the move, Gary.]

770

three people in one move!]

772

Hyung Don's turn.]

773
00:51:41,434 --> 00:51:43,819
[Barely passes by Gary.]

774
00:51:46,048 --> 00:51:48,299

switch their spots, they win!]

[Will the Red Team be able to win?]

776
00:52:01,955 --> 00:52:06,056

[Red Team succeeds!]

779
00:52:14,117 --> 00:52:15,973
Give us our balls! Give us our balls!

780
00:52:28,528 --> 00:52:30,532
<i>Since you came in first place,
you get four snowballs.</i>

781

for coming in at first place!]

782

[Moving on to the next location
of the race.]

783
00:52:47,743 --> 00:52:49,568
A restaurant?

784
00:52:50,888 --> 00:52:53,417
[This fancy restaurant
is their third location?]

785
00:52:53,417 --> 00:52:54,884
<i>I guess they are going to
feed us after all.</i>

786
00:52:54,885 --> 00:52:58,732
Hey, do you think this mission is one
where we have to eat a lot of food?

787
00:52:58,733 --> 00:53:01,457
- Even just the thought of it makes me happy.
- Then we'd definitely take first place.

788
00:53:01,458 --> 00:53:05,064
- We're not much worse than the other teams.
- I don't think so either.

789
00:53:10,253 --> 00:53:15,704
[A lively Christmas atmosphere
on the inside.]

790
00:53:16,377 --> 00:53:18,757
[But what are these numbers on the chairs?]

791
00:53:18,758 --> 00:53:24,319
<i>Pull out one of the spoons in front
of you and show it to the camera.</i>

792
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:25,423
One of these?

793
00:53:30,239 --> 00:53:32,082
- Number three.
- Go take seat number three.

794
00:53:32,083 --> 00:53:33,301
[Gary's seat for having pulled number three.]

795
00:53:35,635 --> 00:53:39,975
- Just show it to the camera.
- You're supposed to do it like this.

796
00:53:43,221 --> 00:53:46,744
<i>This mission... a is Christmas feast.</i>

797
00:53:47,984 --> 00:53:50,775
[The third mission- Christmas feast.]

798
00:53:50,775 --> 00:53:52,585
- Do you all know the game, '31'?
- Yes!

799
00:53:52,586 --> 00:53:55,224
- Yes.
- So you do know the game?

800
00:53:55,225 --> 00:53:58,540
[The thirty first person to get caught loses.]

801
00:53:59,460 --> 00:54:03,341
[Rule: First, choose the dish
that you'd like to eat.]

802
00:54:04,404 --> 00:54:06,937
[Eat as many bites as you'd like,
then pass it to the person next to you.]

803
00:54:06,937 --> 00:54:10,727
[The person to eat
the thirty first dish is disqualified.]

804
00:54:10,727 --> 00:54:14,111
<i>And those disqualified can leave their
seats and sit over here on the sidelines.</i>

805
00:54:15,167 --> 00:54:16,317
This one sounds like fun.

806
00:54:16,318 --> 00:54:20,343
For some reason today,
I can't understand a thing that's being said.

807
00:54:20,344 --> 00:54:22,395
All you have to do is just
eat the food.

808
00:54:23,493 --> 00:54:26,945
<i>I can give up to five dishes per person.</i>

809
00:54:26,946 --> 00:54:31,772
<i>And the person who can last to the end
until the last dish is the winner.</i>

810
00:54:31,971 --> 00:54:34,916
Okay, Shin Dong...
which one are you going to choose?

811
00:54:36,413 --> 00:54:42,202
[The first dish is... steak.]

812
00:54:42,202 --> 00:54:47,074
[Starting the first round with
such a delicious dish as this one?]

813
00:54:48,837 --> 00:54:53,088
- Steak? How do you eat that? Cut it?
- That looks delicious!

814
00:54:53,089 --> 00:54:56,053
- You can just be seated.
- That one should be mine!

815
00:54:57,726 --> 00:54:59,565
You really know how to pick it!

816
00:54:59,566 --> 00:55:01,137
- Hello.
- Hello.

817
00:55:01,138 --> 00:55:03,582
- You are so beautiful!
- Thank you.

818
00:55:03,583 --> 00:55:07,751
[Bite sized dishes. Enough for 31 bites.]

819
00:55:08,820 --> 00:55:12,346
[Number one seat's Shin Dong
to start the eating.]

820
00:55:12,347 --> 00:55:15,495
- Wait, don't just eat, but think about it.
- You have to calculate as you eat.

821
00:55:15,496 --> 00:55:16,760
We're on the same team.

822
00:55:16,761 --> 00:55:20,256
[Have to think carefully about how many
bites to eat before he starts eating...]

823
00:55:20,256 --> 00:55:24,618
- One or two doesn't really matter...
- You can have up to five bites each.

824
00:55:24,619 --> 00:55:28,980
- Three!
- I think this dish may end right around me.

825
00:55:28,981 --> 00:55:31,875
- I think it's going to be one of us.
- They're all going to eat five bites.

826
00:55:31,876 --> 00:55:33,318
Four bites. All done.

827
00:55:33,319 --> 00:55:35,149
- Only four?
- Have another bite.

828
00:55:35,150 --> 00:55:36,550
Hey, why are you eating like
a vegetarian?

829
00:55:38,859 --> 00:55:41,040
[Now only 27 bites left of the steak!]

830
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:44,032
- That looks really good.
- I don't care if I lose, let me just try it.

831
00:55:45,789 --> 00:55:50,034
[Next one up is Sang Myun]
I think I know who's going to get caught.

832
00:55:50,035 --> 00:55:51,096
Think a little before you eat.

833
00:55:51,096 --> 00:55:54,301
I'm thinking about it while I eat.
I'm not that stupid.

834
00:55:55,624 --> 00:55:57,971
But you keep eating without thinking.

835
00:55:58,777 --> 00:56:00,891
Shin Dong is doing the thinking for me.

836
00:56:02,469 --> 00:56:04,300
- Two.
- You're done at two?

837
00:56:04,301 --> 00:56:07,416
No, I'm saying I finished my second one.

838
00:56:07,417 --> 00:56:09,978
[I'm not done yet...]
Why are you getting mad? Go ahead, eat more!

839
00:56:09,979 --> 00:56:12,882
- He really scared me just now.
- You think that's going to be enough?

840
00:56:13,390 --> 00:56:16,235
[Section in danger of being eliminated.]

841
00:56:16,235 --> 00:56:18,007
We're in danger, aren't we?

842
00:56:18,008 --> 00:56:20,010
Sang Myun just ate four.

843
00:56:20,011 --> 00:56:22,229
- Okay, four bites.
- Four.

844
00:56:22,230 --> 00:56:25,657
- Are you counting in your head?
- I'm not done. I'm going to eat one more.

845
00:56:26,912 --> 00:56:28,407
Normally, I...

846
00:56:28,908 --> 00:56:31,553
- I don't normally eat very much.
- Breathe a little while you eat.

847
00:56:31,554 --> 00:56:34,552
[What are you saying?
That's already your fifth plate...]

848
00:56:35,631 --> 00:56:38,597
[Carnivore Sang Myun finishes off
his fifth plate!]

849
00:56:38,597 --> 00:56:40,946
[Now 22 dishes of the steak left!]

850
00:56:40,947 --> 00:56:43,290
If I could, I'd have all five bites
since I'm so hungry...

851
00:56:43,624 --> 00:56:46,482
Wait... if Gary does what he says,
then that will be 10 dishes.

852
00:56:46,483 --> 00:56:49,666
[At that rate,
Jae Suk is in extreme danger!]

853
00:56:49,667 --> 00:56:52,053
Then that puts me in danger...
I'm in danger.

854
00:56:52,053 --> 00:56:54,014
- No...
- No, you don't think so?

855
00:56:54,015 --> 00:56:56,350
- I'm going to eat all five.
- You can't eat a lot.

856
00:56:56,351 --> 00:56:59,009
- It's okay, Gary... eat all five.
- Gary, eat just one.

857
00:56:59,010 --> 00:57:00,942
I really want to eat one more.

858
00:57:01,963 --> 00:57:05,034
Gary, you can only eat one.
Survival is more important right now.

859
00:57:05,035 --> 00:57:06,734
- Just go ahead and eat!
- Gary, just eat one.

860
00:57:06,735 --> 00:57:09,127
Okay, I'll just eat one. All done.

861
00:57:10,816 --> 00:57:13,158
[Now 21 pieces left.
Hyung Don's turn next.]

862
00:57:13,159 --> 00:57:15,430
- Hyung Don, you should only eat one too.
- What did you say?

863
00:57:17,461 --> 00:57:21,891
[Hyung Don has to eat as little as possible
for Jae Suk to remain alive.]

864
00:57:21,891 --> 00:57:23,173
Stop!

865
00:57:23,174 --> 00:57:25,994
- Hyung Don, stop eating.
- Hyung Don, eat all five bites.

866
00:57:25,995 --> 00:57:28,004
No, you can't.
Then I'm going to be ousted!

867
00:57:28,005 --> 00:57:30,249
- Then I'm going to be ousted!
- He won't be ousted.

868
00:57:34,052 --> 00:57:35,907
Stop it! Stop eating!

869
00:57:35,908 --> 00:57:38,809
[Drunk on the taste and
beyond reason.]

870
00:57:38,809 --> 00:57:41,181
If you keep eating like that,
I'm going to get ousted!

871
00:57:42,396 --> 00:57:44,786
- No, you're not!
- I'm going to get ousted!

872
00:57:44,787 --> 00:57:46,251
<i> You think he'll eat four or five?</i>

873
00:57:46,252 --> 00:57:48,413
Eat if you want. There
will still be three survivors left.

874
00:57:48,413 --> 00:57:49,628
Stop, stop, stop.

875
00:57:49,629 --> 00:57:51,458
- Hyung Don, stop eating.
- Just eat one more.

876
00:57:51,459 --> 00:57:53,262
We're still going to get more food.
So stop eating for now.

877
00:57:53,263 --> 00:57:56,717
[Too alluring of a taste to stop eating...]

878
00:57:59,120 --> 00:58:01,783
- Isn't it good? Eat one more. One more.
- Stop. Stop eating.

879
00:58:01,784 --> 00:58:04,357
You have to stop eating right now.
[Just one more?]

880
00:58:04,358 --> 00:58:06,469
That's enough. Say you're done!

881
00:58:06,470 --> 00:58:08,605
How could you have come up with
such an evil game as this?

882
00:58:08,995 --> 00:58:11,188
This is an evil game to these guys!

883
00:58:11,189 --> 00:58:12,683
[An evil battle between reason
and desire.]

884
00:58:12,684 --> 00:58:15,289
- Stop eating.
- I know you like meat. Eat one more!

885
00:58:15,290 --> 00:58:17,037
I'm about to go crazy!

886
00:58:17,359 --> 00:58:19,770
- Done. I'm done.
- You're done?

887
00:58:20,695 --> 00:58:23,666
[Strong regrets even after
shouting out that he's done.]

888
00:58:23,667 --> 00:58:25,153
Okay, it's my turn.

889
00:58:25,154 --> 00:58:29,657
[Next up is Jong Kook.
Four plates down within moments.]

890
00:58:29,657 --> 00:58:33,651
- How does he chew so fast?
- He does everything well.

891
00:58:35,611 --> 00:58:37,827
- That's amazing.
- He's not human.

892
00:58:37,828 --> 00:58:40,727
[Jong Kook finishes his five plates.
Now only 13 plates left!]

893
00:58:40,728 --> 00:58:42,150
Fighting!

894
00:58:42,151 --> 00:58:46,417
If I eat five here... and five for him...

895
00:58:46,418 --> 00:58:49,769
[Red Team's Jae Suk in extreme danger
of being eliminated.]

896
00:58:50,687 --> 00:58:53,023
- I need a bite of that too...
- There's not going to be any left.

897
00:58:53,024 --> 00:58:54,784
You can't just think about
eating right now.

898
00:58:55,645 --> 00:58:59,087
- Is it good?
- It's unbelievable. Just unbelievable.

899
00:58:59,568 --> 00:59:00,814
I was hungry too.

900
00:59:01,859 --> 00:59:03,228
Three.

901
00:59:05,882 --> 00:59:08,593
Don't fill up just yet.
There's still a lot of food left.

902
00:59:09,976 --> 00:59:11,439
Four. All done.

903
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:14,487
- Suk Jin, you should have one more.
- All I needed was four bites.

904
00:59:14,488 --> 00:59:16,768
[Passing the baton off to Kwang Soo
with four plates left.]

905
00:59:16,769 --> 00:59:17,943
<i>Kwang Soo, just eat one.</i>

906
00:59:17,944 --> 00:59:19,678
Kwang Soo, when do you ever listen
to what other people say?

907
00:59:21,060 --> 00:59:22,826
Kwang Soo, you should just stop there.

908
00:59:22,827 --> 00:59:26,200
[Almost a guarantee that Jae Suk is the
one eliminated if Kwang Soo eats five bites.]

909
00:59:27,311 --> 00:59:30,496
If there's one thing I can say,
you really... have gotten really cool.

910
00:59:31,273 --> 00:59:34,342
[Do you take me for a fool?]

911
00:59:35,797 --> 00:59:37,207
<i>That's the biggest lie!</i>

912
00:59:37,208 --> 00:59:40,328
I have a young friend... and she
wants me to introduce her to you.

913
00:59:40,329 --> 00:59:42,364
Hey, I saw her.
She looks like Jae Suk.

914
00:59:43,328 --> 00:59:45,158
[A blind date?]

915
00:59:45,577 --> 00:59:46,824
I'll introduce you to her.

916
00:59:46,825 --> 00:59:49,916
- Don't stop there.
- Everyone just be quiet!

917
00:59:50,178 --> 00:59:52,564
Can't I just do what I want
with the food that's in front of me?

918
00:59:53,291 --> 00:59:54,825
<i>You should eat... let the boy eat.</i>

919
00:59:54,826 --> 00:59:58,548
[Is it Jae Suk's blind date proposal, or...
the delicious steak in front of him?]

920
00:59:58,549 --> 00:59:59,915
Make up your mind!

921
00:59:59,916 --> 01:00:01,648
- Done!
- That's right!

922
01:00:01,900 --> 01:00:04,943
[Kwang Soo announces that he's done
after just one bite.]

923
01:00:05,542 --> 01:00:08,771
[Eight bites of steak left.
Battle of the minds starts again.]

924
01:00:08,771 --> 01:00:10,141
Juvie, you can only eat one bite.

925
01:00:10,142 --> 01:00:12,438
You can only eat one bite.
It's for our team.

926
01:00:12,439 --> 01:00:18,207
[If Juvie eats only one, that
put Red Team's Ji Hyo in danger!]

927
01:00:18,207 --> 01:00:20,734
- Hey, you have to eat just one.
- Aren't you hungry?

928
01:00:20,735 --> 01:00:23,020
- You have to think about this!
- Juvie.. Juvie!

929
01:00:24,706 --> 01:00:27,272
Even if Jae Suk eats five...

930
01:00:27,610 --> 01:00:29,544
And if Dam only eats one...

931
01:00:29,545 --> 01:00:32,396
[Red Team's Ji Hyo in danger!]

932
01:00:33,162 --> 01:00:36,013
Juvie, stop eating.
Stop eating and hand it off to Dam.

933
01:00:36,014 --> 01:00:37,610
Come on!

934
01:00:39,991 --> 01:00:40,966
You have to think about this.

935
01:00:40,967 --> 01:00:44,027
[What will Yellow Team's Juvie decide?]

936
01:00:44,028 --> 01:00:45,704
- Done!
- That's right!

937
01:00:45,705 --> 01:00:48,343
[Teamwork.
Juvie Train stops after one bite!]

938
01:00:49,058 --> 01:00:52,206
[Whether Jae Suk eats one or five,
his teammate Ji Hyo is in danger...]

939
01:00:52,206 --> 01:00:54,786
- If I eat just one...
- You should eat just one.

940
01:00:54,787 --> 01:00:56,970
Then Dam would eat five.

941
01:00:58,717 --> 01:01:01,137
[The outcome is pretty much decided,
so let's just get to the eating part.]

942
01:01:01,138 --> 01:01:03,880
- Ji Hyo... it's going to be her.
- The end is pretty much written in stone.

943
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:07,961
If Ji Hyo is going to be eliminated anyways,
don't allow Dam to eat all the meat at least.

944
01:01:07,962 --> 01:01:09,816
I'm going to make you go hungry!

945
01:01:12,380 --> 01:01:14,244
[My meat...]

946
01:01:14,245 --> 01:01:17,767
- No! Our Dam worked really hard!
- Jae Suk, eat it all!

947
01:01:17,768 --> 01:01:18,914
[Jae Suk scarfing the food
down as he stated.]

948
01:01:19,898 --> 01:01:23,150
[Finishing off three plates
in the blink of an eye.]

949
01:01:23,151 --> 01:01:26,305
- No, that's Dam's steak.
- Jae Suk, you're a really good eater.

950
01:01:26,947 --> 01:01:29,529
Dam! Just eat two plates and
oust yourself.

951
01:01:29,530 --> 01:01:32,728
- Done!
- I know you're hungry. Eat both.

952
01:01:32,729 --> 01:01:34,200
[If Dam only eats one,
then Ji Hyo will be ousted.]

953
01:01:34,201 --> 01:01:35,414
<i>Dam, just finish it off.</i>

954
01:01:35,415 --> 01:01:42,247
[But... the last
remaining bite of the steak...]

955
01:01:42,247 --> 01:01:45,559
[Should I just eat it?]

956
01:01:45,559 --> 01:01:48,541
Snap out of it, you dummy!
Look at all the food over there!

957
01:01:50,588 --> 01:01:52,565
- Hey!
- Isn't it good? It's really delicious.

958
01:01:52,990 --> 01:01:57,145
[If he eats it, he ousts himself.
If he endures, then Ji Hyo gets ousted.]

959
01:01:59,525 --> 01:02:02,399
[So hungry...]

960
01:02:02,915 --> 01:02:04,073
[I feel you.]

961
01:02:04,791 --> 01:02:06,956
Is this something you even
have to think about, you dummy?

962
01:02:06,957 --> 01:02:09,781
- Hey! Stupid!
- Dam, that steak is just too delicious.

963
01:02:10,691 --> 01:02:13,314
- Eat it, eat it...
- Get yourself together!

964
01:02:13,315 --> 01:02:15,452
- Smell it. Smell it.
- No!

965
01:02:15,453 --> 01:02:18,735
[Beyond reasoning.]

966
01:02:20,069 --> 01:02:22,947
You've worked too hard in the jungle.
Just go on and eat it.

967
01:02:22,948 --> 01:02:27,829
[Will be he able to shout out
that he's done?]

968
01:02:27,829 --> 01:02:29,286
Done!

969
01:02:29,287 --> 01:02:30,606
- Done!
- Yeah!

970
01:02:31,538 --> 01:02:33,845
[Red Team's Ji Hyo is eliminated.]

971
01:02:33,845 --> 01:02:35,945
- Can I eat it since we're done?
- No, you can't!

972
01:02:35,946 --> 01:02:37,239
[It's mine!]

973
01:02:37,677 --> 01:02:38,927
<i>I thought that you were
going to eat it.</i>

974
01:02:39,715 --> 01:02:43,483
<i>- There was so much shouting!
- Our team has to stick it out!</i>

975
01:02:43,484 --> 01:02:46,700
<i>- Our team has to win this game.
- That wasn't easy.</i>

976
01:02:48,526 --> 01:02:50,083
- I'm not eating it... not eating it!
- Here... eat it.

977
01:02:52,622 --> 01:02:56,430
[Even though it's too bad,
Red Team loses one of their members.]

978
01:02:56,431 --> 01:03:00,712
Kwang Soo, I really do appreciate it.
I'll introduce you to that friend I mentioned.

979
01:03:00,713 --> 01:03:02,730
- Thank you, Jae Suk.
- She has a very pretty face.

980
01:03:02,731 --> 01:03:04,938
- Then what's the problem?
- She's 39 years old.

981
01:03:05,378 --> 01:03:08,322
[11 years his senior...]

982
01:03:08,322 --> 01:03:10,925
[He tricked me again...]

983
01:03:11,841 --> 01:03:14,011
- Please make your selection.
- Number one!

984
01:03:14,012 --> 01:03:16,249
[Round two's selection is...]
I bet it's something good!

985
01:03:16,250 --> 01:03:17,368
- It looks delicious.
- What is it?

986
01:03:17,369 --> 01:03:19,941
- Tofu wrapped rice!
- Wow!

987
01:03:19,942 --> 01:03:22,977
[Second round selection is
tofu wrapped rice.]

988
01:03:25,230 --> 01:03:28,153
Okay, let's pass out 31 plates
of the tofu wrapped rice first.

989
01:03:28,154 --> 01:03:31,754
[Serving up 31 plates of tofu wrapped rice.]

990
01:03:32,211 --> 01:03:35,816
[Yellow Team's Ha Ha to start
eating this round.]

991
01:03:36,996 --> 01:03:39,689
<i>I'm really impressed with
all this food!</i>

992
01:03:39,690 --> 01:03:42,342
- Three!
- Think before you eat! Don't eat so much!

993
01:03:42,343 --> 01:03:43,799
- Four!
- Hey!

994
01:03:44,078 --> 01:03:47,384
[I want one too...]
Let's end this, Hyung Don.

995
01:03:47,385 --> 01:03:50,648
[Game or not,
beyond reasoning once again.]

996
01:03:50,649 --> 01:03:51,823
Ryu Dam stole a piece!

997
01:03:52,611 --> 01:03:54,633
Five! Done!

998
01:03:54,633 --> 01:03:57,541
- Ji Hyo, the other way.
- Here. Ryu Dam...

999
01:03:57,542 --> 01:03:59,846
- No, you have to go the other way.
- No, I guess it's not you.

1000
01:03:59,847 --> 01:04:01,159
Why? Why?

1001
01:04:01,995 --> 01:04:05,402
[Next turn goes back to
seat number one, Shin Dong.]

1002
01:04:05,983 --> 01:04:08,643
- Why are we going this way?
- Hey, think about it before you eat.

1003
01:04:10,868 --> 01:04:14,135
[Battle of the words heating up again.]

1004
01:04:14,136 --> 01:04:17,297
- Just eat one each.
- No, we can all eat five.

1005
01:04:17,298 --> 01:04:19,089
Hey! You can only eat one!

1006
01:04:19,090 --> 01:04:21,565
- Whatever, one!
- Hey! You can only eat one!

1007
01:04:22,225 --> 01:04:24,303
Hey! Think about it before you
start eating!

1008
01:04:24,304 --> 01:04:26,628
- Shin Dong is a pig!
- You're going to turn into a pig!

1009
01:04:26,629 --> 01:04:27,823
[Shin Dong finishes his five already!]

1010
01:04:27,824 --> 01:04:31,015
[At this rate, either Suk Jin or
Kwang Soo will be in danger!]

1011
01:04:33,068 --> 01:04:35,030
- What are they doing?
- We're going to be ousted!

1012
01:04:36,577 --> 01:04:39,775
[I'm just hungry.]
They're crazy!

1013
01:04:39,776 --> 01:04:43,291
[Sang Myun also finishes his five
in the blink of an eye!]

1014
01:04:44,873 --> 01:04:47,100
They really are pigs.

1015
01:04:48,633 --> 01:04:52,334
[Not a care about the fate about
their own teammates!]

1016
01:04:52,335 --> 01:04:55,943
Very cool... Sang Myun
and Shin Dong are very cool.

1017
01:04:56,465 --> 01:04:58,021
<i>They really are very cool.</i>

1018
01:05:01,509 --> 01:05:04,528
- How did you stuff all that in your mouth?
- Drink some water with it.

1019
01:05:06,163 --> 01:05:08,974
[His know-how of eating fast.]

1020
01:05:12,313 --> 01:05:14,585
Why don't you try calculating it,
Sang Myun, you fool.

1021
01:05:14,586 --> 01:05:18,329
Five, five, then...

1022
01:05:18,803 --> 01:05:21,354
Hey... we didn't eat that right.

1023
01:05:21,355 --> 01:05:22,480
Five. All done.

1024
01:05:22,481 --> 01:05:25,875
[Gary also finishes eating five.
Next up is Hyung Don!]

1025
01:05:25,876 --> 01:05:28,497
- Here.
- Let us eat some too.

1026
01:05:30,094 --> 01:05:33,409
[Wow! Two pieces at once!]

1027
01:05:34,663 --> 01:05:37,001
[Somehow finishes five already.]

1028
01:05:37,623 --> 01:05:40,302
This really is such a suitable
game for them.

1029
01:05:40,303 --> 01:05:42,281
<i>Yes, it suits them perfectly.</i>

1030
01:05:43,514 --> 01:05:47,602
I realize that if I don't eat all five,
that would leave my team in danger.

1031
01:05:48,506 --> 01:05:50,489
Let's just eat one.
Let's just eat one a piece.

1032
01:05:51,307 --> 01:05:56,429
[Fate of it all rests on Jong Kook's fork.]

1033
01:05:56,430 --> 01:05:59,305
- Jong Kook... why don't we just eat one?
- Yeah, let's just eat one each.

1034
01:05:59,306 --> 01:06:01,859
- Why don't you just eat these?
- Jong Kook...

1035
01:06:02,224 --> 01:06:04,728
- Why don't you eat as much as you want?
- Just eat to your content.

1036
01:06:04,729 --> 01:06:08,608
Hey, do you see how you separated these?
Then only you'll survive.

1037
01:06:13,413 --> 01:06:16,111
- You're trying to kill me?
- No! That was a mistake.

1038
01:06:16,112 --> 01:06:18,784
I miscalculated. Here, just eat two.

1039
01:06:20,052 --> 01:06:22,646
- Two.
- Okay, let's just finish at two.

1040
01:06:23,158 --> 01:06:25,596
- And also...
- Three!

1041
01:06:25,597 --> 01:06:28,113
Just eat all five.
I'm sure you must be hungry.

1042
01:06:28,114 --> 01:06:30,603
- Just eat all five!
- Why don't you stop at four?

1043
01:06:31,570 --> 01:06:33,606
- Four...
- Stop there.

1044
01:06:33,607 --> 01:06:38,515
Whether it's Kwang Soo or Suk Jin,
it's one of our team members that dies.

1045
01:06:38,516 --> 01:06:40,453
- It's because of you!
- It's your fault!

1046
01:06:40,454 --> 01:06:42,651
[This all happened because of
Shin Dong and Sang Myun.]

1047
01:06:42,652 --> 01:06:45,087
- Really?
- You still don't know this is because of you?

1048
01:06:47,567 --> 01:06:52,121
[If he eats it, Suk Jin is out.
If he doesn't eat, then Kwang Soo is out!]

1049
01:06:52,122 --> 01:06:53,318
Done!

1050
01:06:58,682 --> 01:07:01,162
[Suk Jin's happy as a clam
to be left alive.]

1051
01:07:01,685 --> 01:07:04,763
- I'll be really good to you.
- Suk Jin could eat two since he's hungry.

1052
01:07:04,764 --> 01:07:07,532
What an absurd thing to say.

1053
01:07:07,533 --> 01:07:08,680
Suk Jin...

1054
01:07:08,681 --> 01:07:13,158
[What is it that Kwang Soo would
like to say?]

1055
01:07:13,879 --> 01:07:17,496
What is it that you want from me?
You're telling me to eat two?

1056
01:07:18,360 --> 01:07:22,236
[Telling his older brother to eat both
and back out of the game?]

1057
01:07:22,237 --> 01:07:27,038
Why are you calling me your brother?
You and I ended five minutes ago.

1058
01:07:30,774 --> 01:07:33,368
- Why don't you eat one first?
- Okay, we can talk after I eat one.

1059
01:07:35,544 --> 01:07:37,757
Kwang Soo... done.

1060
01:07:41,283 --> 01:07:44,052
[Blue Team's Kwang Soo is eliminated!]

1061
01:07:45,112 --> 01:07:47,993
[Easy Brothers, my butt...]

1062
01:07:47,994 --> 01:07:49,065
It's because of you two.

1063
01:07:49,065 --> 01:07:50,626
We told you to stop eating.
Couldn't you calculate that in your head?

1064
01:07:50,627 --> 01:07:53,920
[We were just hungry...]

1065
01:07:54,720 --> 01:07:56,329
<i>- Number ten.
- Ten.</i>

1066
01:07:56,330 --> 01:08:01,143
[The third round food is...

1067
01:08:01,144 --> 01:08:06,042
[Fish cake skewers!]

1068
01:08:06,043 --> 01:08:08,997
I can eat a hundred of those!

1069
01:08:08,998 --> 01:08:11,091
- A hundred?
- Yeah, I can eat a hundred.

1070
01:08:11,873 --> 01:08:14,987
- That's my favorite.
- Just eat one.

1071
01:08:14,988 --> 01:08:17,445
[31 skewers of fish cakes!]

1072
01:08:17,445 --> 01:08:20,373
[Yellow Team's Juvie starts.]

1073
01:08:20,374 --> 01:08:23,040
Why don't we keep it fun and
just eat one each?

1074
01:08:25,489 --> 01:08:27,257
- This tastes unbelievable.
- Two.

1075
01:08:27,258 --> 01:08:30,039
- Nice.
- He's a good eater.

1076
01:08:30,040 --> 01:08:32,059
Can't you give us some soy sauce?

1077
01:08:32,352 --> 01:08:34,840
- That'll make you fat.
- This is already seasoned.

1078
01:08:34,841 --> 01:08:37,524
[He's already...]

1079
01:08:38,485 --> 01:08:42,267
- I'm already fat, didn't you know?
- They're really sharp witted aren't they?

1080
01:08:42,268 --> 01:08:43,378
Three.

1081
01:08:43,379 --> 01:08:46,092
If you add a little milk to the fish cakes,
they won't make your face swell up.

1082
01:08:47,045 --> 01:08:51,194
[Sang Myun concerned about
the size of his face.]

1083
01:08:51,195 --> 01:08:53,030
It's better for the face to appear
smaller on screen.

1084
01:08:53,888 --> 01:08:56,040
[Yellow Team's Juvie
finishes eating all five.]

1085
01:08:56,041 --> 01:08:58,976
- Five.
- I really love this stuff.

1086
01:09:00,314 --> 01:09:05,354
[If Jae Suk eats too many, it put his own
team members, Gary and Hyung Don in danger!]

1087
01:09:05,355 --> 01:09:07,278
Jae Suk, I'll take care of it!
Just eat one!

1088
01:09:07,279 --> 01:09:09,202
Once you start eating though,
you can't stop just at one.

1089
01:09:09,203 --> 01:09:11,224
[Starting off by eating one first.]

1090
01:09:11,225 --> 01:09:13,678
- One more. Eat one more.
- What looks really delicious.

1091
01:09:13,898 --> 01:09:15,996
Jae Suk! Stop!

1092
01:09:16,216 --> 01:09:18,560
- Just let him eat all five.
- This is just so good.

1093
01:09:18,561 --> 01:09:20,534
- Just go on and eat one more.
- Jae Suk, you can't!

1094
01:09:21,380 --> 01:09:24,569
- You can't eat anymore!
- I just saw the face of an angel.

1095
01:09:25,005 --> 01:09:27,714
I looked over this way and,
'Just go on and eat one more'.

1096
01:09:29,536 --> 01:09:31,228
Just eat one more.

1097
01:09:33,425 --> 01:09:36,785
You know how angel's voice sounds
in movies? 'Just eat one more'.

1098
01:09:37,726 --> 01:09:40,853
- You really have to think, Jae Suk.
- Done!

1099
01:09:40,854 --> 01:09:42,451
[Jae Suk is finished after eating
one piece of the fish cake skewer.]

1100
01:09:42,451 --> 01:09:44,785
[At last, Ryu Dam is up next.]

1101
01:09:45,389 --> 01:09:47,494
<i>Just eat one each. One each.</i>

1102
01:09:47,495 --> 01:09:51,590
[Can't hear you.]

1103
01:09:52,695 --> 01:09:54,744
He didn't really get to eat the steak, and
he didn't get the tofu wrapped rice either.

1104
01:09:54,745 --> 01:09:56,322
[Already scarfing down two.]

1105
01:10:00,218 --> 01:10:02,397
Dam! Dam, stop eating!

1106
01:10:02,398 --> 01:10:04,385
Dam, stop! Stop eating!

1107
01:10:04,386 --> 01:10:07,667
[Whether he can hear or not...
He finishes his third one.]

1108
01:10:07,668 --> 01:10:09,435
Two more. Eat two more.

1109
01:10:14,166 --> 01:10:15,585
<i>Dam, you have to stop eating!</i>

1110
01:10:17,710 --> 01:10:20,982
<i>Dam, you have to stop eating!
You're putting us in danger.</i>

1111
01:10:20,983 --> 01:10:24,209
[Beyond reason at his state.
Finishes his fourth piece.]

1112
01:10:24,210 --> 01:10:26,792
You're so cute when you eat.
You seriously look adorable.

1113
01:10:26,792 --> 01:10:29,148
<i>Dam, you can't be doing that.
Dam, listen to me.</i>

1114
01:10:31,394 --> 01:10:33,011
He's not done.

1115
01:10:33,012 --> 01:10:36,974
Dam, stop eating. You don't
even have any room to fit that in.

1116
01:10:37,525 --> 01:10:40,256
[No matter what other say,
he ultimately ends up eating all five.]

1117
01:10:44,735 --> 01:10:48,378
- He can't hear a word you're saying.
- Dong Hoon, just eat one.

1118
01:10:48,379 --> 01:10:49,882
<i>Give me some water.</i>

1119
01:10:49,883 --> 01:10:52,417
- It's really delicious.
- He can eat one more, couldn't he?

1120
01:10:52,839 --> 01:10:56,501
[The taste which makes it impossible
to stop after just one bite.]

1121
01:10:57,553 --> 01:10:58,893
[Finishing off his second.]

1122
01:10:58,894 --> 01:11:01,051
I want you to stop eating.

1123
01:11:01,052 --> 01:11:03,749
[Can't hear you.]

1124
01:11:04,868 --> 01:11:06,885
<i>Is it all over for them?</i>

1125
01:11:07,771 --> 01:11:09,798
[Fourth one!]
Nice! Eat one more. Get one more.

1126
01:11:09,799 --> 01:11:11,518
- One last one.
- Eat one more.

1127
01:11:11,519 --> 01:11:14,359
[Ultimately eats all five.]

1128
01:11:15,891 --> 01:11:19,909
[If the other team members eat a lot
of the skewers, then Jong Kook is ousted.]

1129
01:11:19,910 --> 01:11:21,573
Eat five. Eat all five.

1130
01:11:22,539 --> 01:11:25,954
- You look like you're really deep in thought.
- Three.

1131
01:11:25,955 --> 01:11:29,124
[Fish cake deep in thought.]

1132
01:11:29,616 --> 01:11:31,507
You have to eat all five, okay?

1133
01:11:31,935 --> 01:11:34,848
[Jong Kook is most likely to get ousted.]

1134
01:11:34,849 --> 01:11:37,820
<i>This is going to leave me in
a tough spot.</i>

1135
01:11:37,821 --> 01:11:40,125
<i>Look at him drinking up
the broth first.</i>

1136
01:11:42,410 --> 01:11:43,272
It's too salty.

1137
01:11:43,273 --> 01:11:46,574
[Making the dish bland since he
doesn't like his face bloated.]

1138
01:11:47,382 --> 01:11:50,699
[Self proclaimed fish cake mania.]

1139
01:11:50,700 --> 01:11:52,489
- One.
- What a good eater.

1140
01:11:54,614 --> 01:11:58,293
[Swallows after
chewing it up only three times?]

1141
01:12:00,821 --> 01:12:03,242
<i>Chew at least four times
before you swallow it.</i>

1142
01:12:03,243 --> 01:12:05,347
He really is like a pig!

1143
01:12:07,460 --> 01:12:10,183
[Finishing off four pieces of
the fish cake in a flash.]

1144
01:12:10,733 --> 01:12:13,508
You have to keep me around to
make sure the show stays funny.

1145
01:12:14,022 --> 01:12:17,931
[In the meantime, Gary
already finishes off his third one.]

1146
01:12:17,932 --> 01:12:19,378
- Done.
- Why don't you eat one more?

1147
01:12:19,379 --> 01:12:22,757
I will pass this off to Hyung Don
and let it rest in his hands.

1148
01:12:22,758 --> 01:12:24,672
[Passes it off to Hyung Don
with three left on the plate.]

1149
01:12:24,673 --> 01:12:30,317
[Depending on Hyung Don's decision,
either Jong Kook or Suk Jin will be ousted.]

1150
01:12:30,318 --> 01:12:32,716
- It's really delicious.
- Let me at least try it first.

1151
01:12:33,290 --> 01:12:36,989
You and I could do
the game together for a while.

1152
01:12:38,333 --> 01:12:41,036
[Trying to convince him.]

1153
01:12:46,538 --> 01:12:48,563
- You didn't see that? He did it.
- I didn't do anything.

1154
01:12:50,700 --> 01:12:54,082
[If Hyung Don eats that,
then Jong Kook is ousted!]

1155
01:12:54,083 --> 01:12:58,128
- How can you allow him to live instead?
- So this is the ultimate fish cake?

1156
01:12:58,762 --> 01:13:02,927
[The ultimate fish cake.]

1157
01:13:04,115 --> 01:13:07,738
[If he eats it, Jong Kook is out!
If he doesn't, then Suk Jin is out!]

1158
01:13:07,739 --> 01:13:09,823
Are you allowed to use
your strength like that?

1159
01:13:09,824 --> 01:13:11,795
My will when it comes to food is
stronger than most other people.

1160
01:13:16,224 --> 01:13:18,451
[I'm going to eat it!]

1161
01:13:21,180 --> 01:13:24,667
[The two willful people's fight!]

1162
01:13:27,174 --> 01:13:29,208
- Give me my fish cake!
- Hyung Don..

1163
01:13:29,892 --> 01:13:32,548
Jong Kook's strength
isn't what you're used to.

1164
01:13:32,549 --> 01:13:35,704
Hyung Don... think about it. Think.

1165
01:13:36,104 --> 01:13:38,651
- Hyung Don...
- This is like back in the day.

1166
01:13:40,214 --> 01:13:42,451
Hyung Don... Hyung Don.

1167
01:13:44,694 --> 01:13:47,296
[There's one more...]

1168
01:13:47,297 --> 01:13:49,290
Great job, Hyung Don!

1169
01:13:49,291 --> 01:13:51,858
- Great job, Hyung Don!
- Just stop now!

1170
01:13:53,484 --> 01:13:55,742
How about I just eat both
and oust myself then?

1171
01:13:56,338 --> 01:13:58,658
[Huh? He's going to self-terminate?]

1172
01:13:58,659 --> 01:14:01,475
- I'll be considerate of your team next time.
- I'll just eat both and kill myself.

1173
01:14:01,476 --> 01:14:04,026
This is seriously delicious.
I'll eat both and kill myself.

1174
01:14:04,027 --> 01:14:07,705
[The fish cakes are delicious enough
to kill himself over?]

1175
01:14:07,706 --> 01:14:09,179
No, I really will just kill myself.

1176
01:14:09,180 --> 01:14:13,880
- With the steak earlier...
- He's been full all morning.

1177
01:14:13,881 --> 01:14:17,821
[Eating one for now... done.]

1178
01:14:18,361 --> 01:14:19,999
Done!

1179
01:14:24,076 --> 01:14:25,648
Great job!

1180
01:14:27,269 --> 01:14:32,347
[Yellow Team's Jong Kook is
ultimately eliminated.]

1181
01:14:34,629 --> 01:14:39,116
[Eliminated players starting to
pile up one by one from the game.]

1182
01:14:39,117 --> 01:14:44,397
[Food for this round is... huh?]

1183
01:14:44,398 --> 01:14:46,536
<i>One came alone.
Two came together?</i>

1184
01:14:47,112 --> 01:14:52,069
[This time, it's not food,
but a mini game.]

1185
01:14:53,735 --> 01:14:57,642
[Giraffe Kwang Soo transformed
into an Assistant.]

1186
01:14:59,165 --> 01:15:01,854
We will now start the game,
One came alone. Two came together.

1187
01:15:03,555 --> 01:15:05,212
The game is very simple.

1188
01:15:05,647 --> 01:15:06,723
<i>He really is so ugly.</i>

1189
01:15:06,723 --> 01:15:09,731
If I shout out, one person came alone,
then only one person will stand up.

1190
01:15:10,513 --> 01:15:14,578
And when I shout out, two came together,
then two people can stand up.

1191
01:15:16,069 --> 01:15:19,652
We will now start the game,
One came alone. Two came together.

1192
01:15:19,653 --> 01:15:22,614
- Okay.
- Starting with Jae Suk. One!

1193
01:15:22,615 --> 01:15:25,000
- One came alone!
- One.

1194
01:15:25,001 --> 01:15:26,146
One came alone.

1195
01:15:26,147 --> 01:15:27,979
- One!
- One came alone.

1196
01:15:27,980 --> 01:15:29,796
- One.
- One came alone.

1197
01:15:29,797 --> 01:15:31,418
- One.
- One came alone.

1198
01:15:31,419 --> 01:15:32,952
- One.
- One came alone.

1199
01:15:32,953 --> 01:15:34,430
- One.
- One came alone.

1200
01:15:34,431 --> 01:15:36,360
- One.
- One came alone.

1201
01:15:36,361 --> 01:15:38,136
- One.
- One came alone.

1202
01:15:41,281 --> 01:15:43,272
You only keep saying one!

1203
01:15:43,273 --> 01:15:45,301
I guess I'm going to have to
teach you a lesson.

1204
01:15:45,929 --> 01:15:47,821
I guess I'm going to have to
teach you a lesson.

1205
01:15:48,389 --> 01:15:50,222
This is Running Man!

1206
01:15:50,223 --> 01:15:53,318
- Remember that you're on Running Man!
- He's not an easy opponent.

1207
01:15:54,566 --> 01:15:56,432
- We will start with Jae Suk.
- We understand.

1208
01:15:56,645 --> 01:15:58,424
- One.
- One came alone.

1209
01:15:58,638 --> 01:16:00,584
- Two.
- Two came together.

1210
01:16:00,585 --> 01:16:02,252
- Three!
- Three came together!

1211
01:16:02,253 --> 01:16:04,084
- Three!
- Three came together!

1212
01:16:04,085 --> 01:16:05,813
- Two!
- Two came together!

1213
01:16:05,814 --> 01:16:07,475
- One.
- One came alone.

1214
01:16:07,476 --> 01:16:09,192
- Three!
- Three came together!

1215
01:16:09,193 --> 01:16:10,974
- Four!
- Four came together!

1216
01:16:10,975 --> 01:16:12,956
- Three!
- Three came together!

1217
01:16:12,957 --> 01:16:14,800
- Two.
- Two came together!

1218
01:16:14,801 --> 01:16:16,919
- Five!
- Five came together!

1219
01:16:18,179 --> 01:16:22,050
[Since 'Five' was shouted out,
Hyung Don should be getting up too...]

1220
01:16:22,050 --> 01:16:26,457
[Red Team's Hyung Don is out!]

1221
01:16:31,290 --> 01:16:32,909
Running Man really is hard.

1222
01:16:37,010 --> 01:16:40,378
[Now four survivors in the eighth round.]

1223
01:16:40,379 --> 01:16:44,618
[The food in this round is...
orange juice!]

1224
01:16:44,619 --> 01:16:47,099
- I can't drink juice.
- Why not?

1225
01:16:47,100 --> 01:16:49,060
It's because I don't really like juice.

1226
01:16:51,711 --> 01:16:53,243
Ah, because he doesn't like it?

1227
01:16:53,244 --> 01:16:56,521
- But you can drink it though?
- Of course, I can drink it.

1228
01:16:56,522 --> 01:16:58,947
- You like carbonated drinks, don't you?
- Yes, I do.

1229
01:16:58,948 --> 01:17:00,653
I don't like fruit.

1230
01:17:01,637 --> 01:17:05,233
[Who will be the one left with the last
glass of orange juice out of 31?]

1231
01:17:06,221 --> 01:17:08,086
<i>Look at them eating all day.</i>

1232
01:17:08,590 --> 01:17:11,244
- Done.
- He really must not like it.

1233
01:17:11,769 --> 01:17:15,042
[Drinking as much as they want
in the beginning.]

1234
01:17:16,619 --> 01:17:17,894
This is really good.

1235
01:17:20,056 --> 01:17:23,602
- I just had two.
- He can't stop right now.

1236
01:17:23,603 --> 01:17:25,222
Okay.

1237
01:17:25,223 --> 01:17:28,483
[Quickly disappearing juice glasses.

1238
01:17:28,484 --> 01:17:30,510
- Look at him thinking so hard.
- Done.

1239
01:17:30,511 --> 01:17:33,168
<i>They should just drink one each
to see how they're going to end up.</i>

1240
01:17:33,169 --> 01:17:37,185
[Staying cautious without drinking
too much.]

1241
01:17:37,186 --> 01:17:38,435
Done.

1242
01:17:38,915 --> 01:17:43,762
[13 glasses left at the moment.]

1243
01:17:43,763 --> 01:17:46,891
- I think I'm getting the picture.
- Okay, let's start the countdown.

1244
01:17:46,892 --> 01:17:49,711
<i>Five, four, three, two...</i>

1245
01:17:49,712 --> 01:17:51,928
[Since he has to have a drink,
he drinks one for now...]

1246
01:17:53,570 --> 01:17:56,367
[Ha Ha also cautiously drinks one.]

1247
01:17:56,907 --> 01:17:59,377
- He hates this stuff.
- You drank one?

1248
01:18:02,403 --> 01:18:04,217
- I know he doesn't like that stuff.
- Shin Dong, you hate this stuff.

1249
01:18:04,218 --> 01:18:06,561
- He doesn't like juice!
- I know you don't like this.

1250
01:18:06,562 --> 01:18:09,736
- Three!
- It's actually tasting pretty good now.

1251
01:18:11,003 --> 01:18:13,557
[In that case...]

1252
01:18:13,558 --> 01:18:16,171
- I'll leave it up to Suk Jin.
- Five!

1253
01:18:16,172 --> 01:18:18,375
[After drinking all five,
passes the baton off to Suk Jin.]

1254
01:18:18,375 --> 01:18:23,629
[Depending on how many he drinks,
it'll determine who will be eliminated.]

1255
01:18:24,021 --> 01:18:25,688
[If he leaves only one,
then Jae Suk will be eliminated!]

1256
01:18:25,688 --> 01:18:28,114
[But if he leaves two,
then Ha Ha gets eliminated!]

1257
01:18:28,115 --> 01:18:30,109
You should really stop drinking.

1258
01:18:30,110 --> 01:18:32,249
[Drinking without any hesitation.]

1259
01:18:32,250 --> 01:18:34,549
Suk Jin, you can't be doing this.

1260
01:18:34,550 --> 01:18:37,590
Come on, you know better!

1261
01:18:37,591 --> 01:18:40,711
- Suk Jin... think about it carefully.
- Give me a break, Suk Jin.

1262
01:18:42,916 --> 01:18:46,475
[Now... there are only two glasses left.]

1263
01:18:46,475 --> 01:18:52,619
[If he ends it here, Ha Ha is ousted.
If he drinks one more, Jae Suk is ousted!]

1264
01:18:52,620 --> 01:18:58,654
I wish that Suk Jin would get honest
about this game right now.

1265
01:18:59,258 --> 01:19:00,416
What?

1266
01:19:02,730 --> 01:19:04,616
Which one of the two are you
going to kill?

1267
01:19:04,617 --> 01:19:06,679
You have to think about
the next game.

1268
01:19:06,680 --> 01:19:10,071
<i>- You have to think about the next game.
- Which one are you going to choose?</i>

1269
01:19:10,072 --> 01:19:14,658
[Final mission is the snowball fight...
In that case!]

1270
01:19:14,659 --> 01:19:15,979
You have to be careful.

1271
01:19:15,980 --> 01:19:22,835
[If he drinks it, Jae Suk is out!
If he doesn't, then Ha Ha is out!]

1272
01:19:22,835 --> 01:19:24,142
- Done!
- Done!

1273
01:19:25,084 --> 01:19:27,255
[Yellow Team confirmed
as the last place holder.]

1274
01:19:27,256 --> 01:19:28,830
Okay! We did it!

1275
01:19:28,831 --> 01:19:31,572
Okay then. We know who
the death note will go to now.

1276
01:19:31,573 --> 01:19:33,848
- We got it now.
- Am I included in that death note?

1277
01:19:35,512 --> 01:19:44,553
[In the order that they placed,
each team is given their share of snowballs.]

1278
01:19:44,553 --> 01:19:45,978
Thank you!

1279
01:19:59,883 --> 01:20:02,074
<i>It feels really good to be in first place.</i>

1280
01:20:02,075 --> 01:20:04,950
- There's something up there.
- Something's already been prepared for us?

1281
01:20:04,951 --> 01:20:07,462
There's something up there.
Is that something for us to wear?

1282
01:20:08,684 --> 01:20:10,318
They're vests.

1283
01:20:10,319 --> 01:20:12,324
Why do we have to wear these now?

1284
01:20:13,102 --> 01:20:20,478
[Oust other members by throwing your
snowballs. Last one left alive is the winner.]

1285
01:20:20,479 --> 01:20:24,739
<i>You remember that the team that
comes in last gets punished, right?</i>

1286
01:20:24,740 --> 01:20:27,851
- We just have to make sure not to lose.
- Just make sure we don't come in last.

1287
01:20:27,852 --> 01:20:32,203
- Jong Kook isn't very good at throwing.
- It's not about strength but aiming right.

1288
01:20:32,204 --> 01:20:35,026
That's right...
remember the baseball game?

1289
01:20:35,027 --> 01:20:36,728
Kim Jong Kook isn't good at baseball.

1290
01:20:36,729 --> 01:20:40,667
- I'm sure they're going to aim for us first.
- We don't know that.

1291
01:20:40,668 --> 01:20:42,518
[Yellow Team in most danger
with only four.]

1292
01:20:45,010 --> 01:20:50,684
[Snowball fight - Start!]

1293
01:20:50,685 --> 01:20:52,112
Let's go! Let's say fighting.

1294
01:20:52,113 --> 01:20:55,182
[Gathering around for a shout out.]

1295
01:20:55,183 --> 01:20:56,614
<i>One, two, three, fighting!</i>

1296
01:20:57,830 --> 01:21:00,664
It feels like we're going off to battle.

1297
01:21:01,344 --> 01:21:03,402
Why is the Yellow Team standing over there?

1298
01:21:04,136 --> 01:21:06,127
- Red Team!
- What?

1299
01:21:06,682 --> 01:21:11,698
[Yellow Team with the least amount
of balls proposes a coalition.]

1300
01:21:11,699 --> 01:21:13,327
Shall we work together?

1301
01:21:14,157 --> 01:21:19,753
Since this isn't about ripping off name tags,
we're not afraid of Jong Kook.

1302
01:21:20,683 --> 01:21:21,919
Come on!

1303
01:21:23,141 --> 01:21:27,737
[Yellow Team staying cautious from
having only four balls in their possession.]

1304
01:21:29,075 --> 01:21:31,824
Yellow Team only has four balls.

1305
01:21:31,825 --> 01:21:35,812
That's right, they only have four.
And the Red Team has six.

1306
01:21:35,812 --> 01:21:38,175
We have to keep our eye on the Yellow Team.

1307
01:21:38,176 --> 01:21:40,691
You know what Yellow Team is waiting for?

1308
01:21:40,692 --> 01:21:43,417
They're waiting for our teams to fight
since they only have a few balls.

1309
01:21:43,880 --> 01:21:46,522
[They're close... now's the chance!]

1310
01:21:52,543 --> 01:21:54,955
If you're going to it so weak like this,
why even bother throwing it?

1311
01:21:54,956 --> 01:21:58,849
[Blue Team gains one more from
Juvie's weak throw.]

1312
01:21:58,850 --> 01:22:01,220
[Crap...]

1313
01:22:01,221 --> 01:22:05,727
[Yellow Team now down to only three balls.]

1314
01:22:05,728 --> 01:22:07,602
I felt good about it...

1315
01:22:09,302 --> 01:22:12,013
I didn't count on the wind.

1316
01:22:12,600 --> 01:22:17,969
[They were already at a disadvantage,
and now they're even more so...]

1317
01:22:17,970 --> 01:22:19,800
- We're seriously...
- Why did he throw it?

1318
01:22:20,228 --> 01:22:24,388
[Giving up on attacking,
and now just trying to survive...]

1319
01:22:29,443 --> 01:22:31,547
[Red Team's Jae Suk on the attack!]

1320
01:22:31,547 --> 01:22:35,271
[Red Team vs. Blue Team first!]

1321
01:22:36,132 --> 01:22:39,060
[The imminent face-off!]

1322
01:22:39,061 --> 01:22:40,920
Sang Myun, corner them!

1323
01:22:43,108 --> 01:22:47,490
[Yellow Team watching the other
two teams battle it out first.]

1324
01:22:47,491 --> 01:22:49,235
We really don't have enough arsenal.

1325
01:22:49,236 --> 01:22:50,696
Over here!

1326
01:22:50,697 --> 01:22:52,149
Get Sang Myun!

1327
01:22:53,165 --> 01:22:56,099
[Misses his aim!]

1328
01:22:57,335 --> 01:22:59,480
[Red Team uses this moment to attack!]

1329
01:22:59,481 --> 01:23:01,633
[Gary's attack succeeds!]

1330
01:23:03,024 --> 01:23:06,920
[Jae Suk also succeeds from the back!]

1331
01:23:06,920 --> 01:23:09,530
[Within moments,
Sang Myun from the Blue Team is out!]

1332
01:23:10,116 --> 01:23:14,100
[The remaining Blue Team members
start their counterattack!]

1333
01:23:14,962 --> 01:23:16,948
[Heading towards Hyung Don!]

1334
01:23:16,949 --> 01:23:18,772
No! No!

1335
01:23:22,205 --> 01:23:26,374
[A stand-off.]

1336
01:23:27,022 --> 01:23:30,244
- We are...
- This is just making it easier for Jong Kook.

1337
01:23:30,245 --> 01:23:32,474
- Seriously...
- We have to think about this.

1338
01:23:32,475 --> 01:23:34,628
- Jae Suk!
- We just need to make sure we're not last.

1339
01:23:34,629 --> 01:23:39,208
Since they don't have many balls,
let's all oust them first.

1340
01:23:39,209 --> 01:23:41,710
- Okay.
- Let's work together first.

1341
01:23:42,623 --> 01:23:46,190
[Both teams agree on targeting
the Yellow Team first.]

1342
01:23:46,191 --> 01:23:47,540
We'll wait down there then.

1343
01:23:47,541 --> 01:23:50,587
The bottom line is for both our teams
to abstain from coming in last.

1344
01:23:50,588 --> 01:23:53,861
- Okay... then go on down.
- We'll see you later then.

1345
01:23:54,654 --> 01:23:58,318
[A coalition without any trust.]

1346
01:23:58,319 --> 01:24:01,009
- Should we forget about our trust?
- I've had a lot of experiences like this one.

1347
01:24:02,420 --> 01:24:04,478
I've been doing this stuff for
seven and a half years now.

1348
01:24:08,044 --> 01:24:09,240
Let's go.

1349
01:24:09,241 --> 01:24:11,026
Wow... here they come.

1350
01:24:11,981 --> 01:24:14,934
[Enemies starting to close in on them.]

1351
01:24:17,314 --> 01:24:21,465
[Yellow Team fleeing to
even higher ground.]

1352
01:24:23,695 --> 01:24:27,901
[The allies closing in on the Yellow Team!]

1353
01:24:27,902 --> 01:24:29,184
Here they come!

1354
01:24:30,299 --> 01:24:32,530
Dong Hoon is cornered.

1355
01:24:34,084 --> 01:24:37,604
[Ha Ha getting captured from
trying to defend his team on his own.]

1356
01:24:37,605 --> 01:24:39,123
You can only kill one of us, okay?

1357
01:24:39,124 --> 01:24:41,155
- I'm serious.
- We only came to get one of you.

1358
01:24:41,156 --> 01:24:43,649
[The wall of enemy line closing in.]

1359
01:24:43,650 --> 01:24:45,466
You can't keep climbing up forever.

1360
01:24:47,340 --> 01:24:50,074
[Climbing up into the mountain?]

1361
01:24:50,910 --> 01:24:52,417
- I'm going to throw this!
- Go ahead and throw it.

1362
01:24:52,418 --> 01:24:54,210
- I'm being serious!
- Go ahead!

1363
01:24:54,211 --> 01:24:56,772
Let's just have a snowball fight.
Why are you climbing up the mountain?

1364
01:24:56,773 --> 01:24:59,695
- How far are you going to go up?
- Don't come any closer.

1365
01:24:59,696 --> 01:25:01,733
How far are you going to go up?

1366
01:25:03,648 --> 01:25:06,015
[He really is climbing up the mountain.]

1367
01:25:06,016 --> 01:25:09,312
- You trying to disappear into the mountain?
- You don't need to put your life on the line!

1368
01:25:09,313 --> 01:25:11,512
[This is all for some laughter,
no need to endanger your life.]

1369
01:25:13,224 --> 01:25:15,696
[Finally finding even ground to
make his getaway.]

1370
01:25:16,458 --> 01:25:18,392
Just what is the punishment that awaits
us for him to do all that?

1371
01:25:18,393 --> 01:25:19,660
Do you really have to go that far?

1372
01:25:20,293 --> 01:25:24,849
[Rendezvous with the Yellow Team
from making it back to safety.]

1373
01:25:24,850 --> 01:25:28,073
We have to get up higher.
Let's ambush them.

1374
01:25:28,074 --> 01:25:30,239
Hurry! Run!

1375
01:25:30,240 --> 01:25:32,368
- Hurry!
- Come on! We have to catch them!

1376
01:25:32,369 --> 01:25:35,184
[The enemies start the chase!]

1377
01:25:36,542 --> 01:25:37,687
Run!

1378
01:25:39,593 --> 01:25:41,229
Come... come all the way up here!

1379
01:25:44,427 --> 01:25:46,053
Ha Ha, come here.

1380
01:25:46,656 --> 01:25:49,284
[Juvie Train in extreme danger!]

1381
01:25:49,285 --> 01:25:50,878
[Just then!]

1382
01:26:01,190 --> 01:26:03,600
[A direct hit at Jae Suk's vest!]

1383
01:26:03,601 --> 01:26:07,505
[Yellow Team's Ryu Dam, nice play!]

1384
01:26:07,506 --> 01:26:10,410
[Jae Suk - Out!]

1385
01:26:12,470 --> 01:26:17,643
[Gains the snowball that Jae Suk
threw at them!]

1386
01:26:17,644 --> 01:26:19,078
Nice! Nice!

1387
01:26:19,079 --> 01:26:23,664
[Ryu Dam coming through at
a critical moment!]

1388
01:26:29,378 --> 01:26:31,853
[Yellow Team still maintaining
their high ground.]

1389
01:26:34,139 --> 01:26:37,326
[A method of protecting their vests
from being hit.]

1390
01:26:39,097 --> 01:26:42,129
[Making it difficult for anyone
to attack one another.]

1391
01:26:42,130 --> 01:26:45,997
- There's Jong Kook...
- We're even numbered right now.

1392
01:26:48,242 --> 01:26:50,689
[Jong Kook succeeds in evading
the snowball!]

1393
01:26:50,690 --> 01:26:54,718
[Attempting to grab the thrown snowball
to use as their own weapon.]

1394
01:26:56,449 --> 01:26:59,790
- Let's all attack at the count of three.
- One, two, three!

1395
01:27:00,993 --> 01:27:04,251
[All movements ceased.]

1396
01:27:04,252 --> 01:27:06,833
- What do we do?
- Throw it, Ha Ha. It's okay.

1397
01:27:08,921 --> 01:27:12,737
[Gary blocks the ball Juvie
throws at him.]

1398
01:27:15,534 --> 01:27:18,150
[Stuck together?]

1399
01:27:18,802 --> 01:27:21,050
[Just then!]

1400
01:27:23,951 --> 01:27:28,601
[Gary hits Juvie directly on his vest!]

1401
01:27:28,601 --> 01:27:31,822
[Juvie Train - Out!]

1402
01:27:39,351 --> 01:27:42,258
[Gary ceases his movement and
targets Jong Kook! Bull's-eye!]

1403
01:27:42,259 --> 01:27:47,062
[Gary ultimately ousts the big fish!]

1404
01:27:47,063 --> 01:27:48,968
Who was it? Awesome!

1405
01:27:48,969 --> 01:27:53,245
[Kim Jong Kook - Out!]

1406
01:27:54,182 --> 01:27:57,818
[We're ruined...]

1407
01:28:03,392 --> 01:28:05,602
[No clue as to where the
battle now stands.]

1408
01:28:05,602 --> 01:28:07,431
We're the club of traitors, aren't we?

1409
01:28:08,448 --> 01:28:11,865
- He's really making me want to get him.
- We no longer have Jong Kook.

1410
01:28:12,334 --> 01:28:14,784
- It's pretty much over.
- Gary, watch out!

1411
01:28:14,785 --> 01:28:16,914
Watch out for what?
They're all just standing there.

1412
01:28:16,915 --> 01:28:18,801
Wow... that team is
really tightly banded together.

1413
01:28:18,802 --> 01:28:21,481
[The trick not working to his satisfaction.]

1414
01:28:24,248 --> 01:28:26,852
[I've been waiting for you.]

1415
01:28:28,066 --> 01:28:31,327
[Hyung Don eliminates Ha Ha
of the Yellow Team!]

1416
01:28:35,908 --> 01:28:39,643
[Ryu Dam's throw is a direct hit
on Hyung Don!]

1417
01:28:40,173 --> 01:28:44,839
[Getting too greedy after ousting Ha Ha...]

1418
01:28:44,840 --> 01:28:47,060
I've been crouched down here
for 30 minutes!

1419
01:28:48,055 --> 01:28:50,547
- What did you do that for?
- I just wanted to oust you!

1420
01:28:51,439 --> 01:28:54,281
[Starting the blame game on
one another!]

1421
01:28:57,144 --> 01:28:59,957
Why did you have to come and kill me?
Why did you come?

1422
01:28:59,958 --> 01:29:02,359
Today was my chance!

1423
01:29:02,360 --> 01:29:03,836
Let's just die together!

1424
01:29:05,475 --> 01:29:07,500
Dong Hoon, what do I do?

1425
01:29:07,501 --> 01:29:10,592
[What is the fate that awaits Ryu Dam
for being the sole survivor?]

1426
01:29:10,593 --> 01:29:16,773
[The enemies are already
starting to close in on him!]

1427
01:29:20,750 --> 01:29:22,856
[Target locked.]

1428
01:29:26,092 --> 01:29:30,221
[Nowhere to run to,
and hard to run in that body!]

1429
01:29:31,038 --> 01:29:32,324
Are you going to climb down?

1430
01:29:32,325 --> 01:29:35,052
[Heading toward Ace Ji Hyo?]

1431
01:29:38,826 --> 01:29:41,814
[Blocks... and blocks again!]

1432
01:29:41,815 --> 01:29:45,014
[Blocked them all?
This is Ace Ji Hyo's skills!]

1433
01:29:45,015 --> 01:29:48,418
[Ryu Dam now down to
zero snowballs!]

1434
01:29:48,419 --> 01:29:51,756
[Enemies start on their attack!]

1435
01:29:54,074 --> 01:29:57,022
[Shin Dong sticks a snowball
on Ryu Dam's back!]

1436
01:29:57,023 --> 01:29:59,820
[But just then!]

1437
01:30:01,981 --> 01:30:04,586
[Kwang Soo locks in on
Ace Ji Hyo as his target!]

1438
01:30:04,587 --> 01:30:07,314
[A direct hit!]

1439
01:30:07,742 --> 01:30:11,794
[As soon as Yellow Team is ousted,
the alliance is over!]

1440
01:30:17,810 --> 01:30:23,416
[Blue Team's Suk Jin, Kwang Soo,
Shin Dong vs. Red Team's Gary!]

1441
01:30:24,378 --> 01:30:26,139
- How may snowballs do you have?
- One.

1442
01:30:29,882 --> 01:30:31,827
[At times Mr. Capable, Gary attacks alone!]

1443
01:30:33,937 --> 01:30:37,271
[Gary eliminates Suk Jin of
the Blue Team!]

1444
01:30:37,272 --> 01:30:40,597
[Blue Team - two snowballs;
Red Team - three snowballs.]

1445
01:30:40,598 --> 01:30:43,701
[Gary never backs down at
times like these!]

1446
01:30:43,702 --> 01:30:45,140
This is a man's battle!

1447
01:30:48,265 --> 01:30:51,194
[Blue Team closing in on Gary
from both ends!]

1448
01:30:54,036 --> 01:30:56,083
[Gary fails at his attack!]

1449
01:30:57,120 --> 01:31:01,222
[Succeeds in deflecting
Kwang Soo's snowball!]

1450
01:31:02,569 --> 01:31:05,789
[Now... in this case!]

1451
01:31:05,790 --> 01:31:08,093
[Kwang Soo has no snowballs left.]

1452
01:31:08,093 --> 01:31:11,404
[And Shin Dong has one left!]

1453
01:31:11,405 --> 01:31:14,279
[Gary starts his chase!]

1454
01:31:14,280 --> 01:31:15,628
I don't have any balls!

1455
01:31:23,126 --> 01:31:24,515
[Shin Dong - Out!]

1456
01:31:24,516 --> 01:31:26,537
[Down to one last one!]

1457
01:31:29,833 --> 01:31:31,304
[With the final snowball...]

1458
01:31:31,305 --> 01:31:35,170
[Hits Kwang Soo on his vest!]

1459
01:31:35,757 --> 01:31:38,968
[Gary does it!]

1460
01:31:38,969 --> 01:31:43,069
[For two years in a row,
the man of Christmas is Gary!]

1461
01:31:43,781 --> 01:31:45,697
<i>Gary Christmas!</i>

1462
01:31:47,023 --> 01:31:50,173
[With Gary's skills,
the Red Team is the final victor!]

1463
01:31:50,174 --> 01:31:53,728
[Gary ousts six players on his own!]

1464
01:31:55,943 --> 01:31:59,255
- Christmas is my show!
- At the end of the year, you really...

1465
01:31:59,256 --> 01:32:01,447
[The man of the year!]

1466
01:32:01,756 --> 01:32:03,692
- Your prize is behind you.
- What are we getting?

1467
01:32:04,412 --> 01:32:06,048
<i>Is someone going to jump
out of there?</i>

1468
01:32:09,469 --> 01:32:11,571
Cookies? Here, you eat it.

1469
01:32:14,943 --> 01:32:17,040
Is it a trip or something?

1470
01:32:18,230 --> 01:32:21,591
[Delicious cookies filling up a large box!]

1471
01:32:21,592 --> 01:32:25,468
[Since Christmas is about feelings,
rather than gifts...]

1472
01:32:26,304 --> 01:32:30,463
[Then what is the final punishment?]

1473
01:32:30,464 --> 01:32:32,918
[Could it be... that?]

1474
01:32:34,708 --> 01:32:38,786
[Red long johns.]

1475
01:32:39,674 --> 01:32:42,055
[You can guess what it is, right?]

1476
01:32:46,208 --> 01:32:49,830
[Night skiing in red long johns!]

1477
01:32:49,830 --> 01:32:51,669
I'm going to tell my mom on you.

1478
01:32:53,098 --> 01:32:56,716
- Let's go!
- Merry Christmas!

1479
01:32:57,606 --> 01:33:00,278
[Long Johns ski, go!]

1480
01:33:01,386 --> 01:33:05,312
[Unbelievable speed thanks to
the added weight on the skis!]

1481
01:33:06,138 --> 01:33:09,283
