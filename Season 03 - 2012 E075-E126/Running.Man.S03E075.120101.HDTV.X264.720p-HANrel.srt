1
00:00:24,542 --> 00:00:25,710
-Two! –Is there?

2
00:00:44,795 --> 00:00:46,097
Have you decided?

3
00:00:56,941 --> 00:00:58,476
-Ah, it’s the first day of the new year.

4
00:00:58,476 --> 00:01:00,177
–Space Controller, why are you wearing the same clothes as me?

5
00:01:00,177 --> 00:01:02,546
Time controller, why are you wearing the same thing as Iam?

6
00:01:02,613 --> 00:01:04,482
Ah, one person has to take it off, Space Controller

7
00:01:04,515 --> 00:01:05,716
I’m seriously about to go crazy

8
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:07,718
-I’m seriously going crazy. – You really look identical!

9
00:01:07,785 --> 00:01:10,688
-Why did I wear this jacket?-Are you jealous of Haroro’s character?

10
00:01:10,721 --> 00:01:12,757
-No, Haroro... -Haroro’s very popular abroad.

11
00:01:12,823 --> 00:01:15,292
He’s very envies after making me into this character.

12
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:16,293
That’s right, he’s trying to take everyone’s character...

13
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,795
The one who controls space.

14
00:01:17,862 --> 00:01:18,963
Greedy person.

15
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:21,365
Ah, I’m seriously going crazy.

16
00:01:21,565 --> 00:01:23,968
Ah, I’m seriously going crazy because of this Time Controller.

17
00:01:25,169 --> 00:01:26,537
Time controller.

18
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:27,571
Space controller.

19
00:01:27,638 --> 00:01:28,773
Sixth Sense.

20
00:01:28,839 --> 00:01:29,807
Duplicator.

21
00:01:29,874 --> 00:01:30,674
Tear it quickly!

22
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:40,718
when are you going to Europe,Europe

23
00:01:40,785 --> 00:01:42,386
Ah, we're working that out now.

24
00:01:42,453 --> 00:01:44,055
It’s really awesome.

25
00:01:44,422 --> 00:01:46,023
Mong Ji’s going too?

26
00:01:48,993 --> 00:01:49,994
He said he’s going alone.

27
00:01:50,061 --> 00:01:50,861
He’s going alone?

28
00:01:52,263 --> 00:01:53,731
Ji Hyo looks so lunxiuriou.

29
00:01:53,798 --> 00:01:55,232
Is it the Serengeti, the Serengeti?

30
00:01:55,299 --> 00:01:57,835
I put some effort before coming to the airport.

31
00:01:57,868 --> 00:01:59,403
-Ah, is that so? – Blank Fashion.

32
00:02:00,237 --> 00:02:01,839
Lollo! Lollo!

33
00:02:01,906 --> 00:02:03,707
What are we doing now?

34
00:02:03,741 --> 00:02:04,642
Why are we at the airport?

35
00:02:04,708 --> 00:02:06,944
Before the race, we have to form teams.

36
00:02:06,977 --> 00:02:08,612
-Ok. –Oh.

37
00:02:08,646 --> 00:02:10,147
-There are a total of four teams today. –Four teams?

38
00:02:10,181 --> 00:02:11,215
-What? –Four teams in all.

39
00:02:11,348 --> 00:02:12,883
-Ok, this is the first team. – Ok.

40
00:02:12,917 --> 00:02:14,485
Gary and Haha.

41
00:02:15,553 --> 00:02:17,388
Hey, Lollol!

42
00:02:17,455 --> 00:02:19,623
-Oh my god! – Hey, don’t you think the other teams will be equally weird?

43
00:02:19,657 --> 00:02:20,925
Haha is going to be my ‘lollol’ today?

44
00:02:20,958 --> 00:02:23,494
Don’t worry, if we lose we’ll just turn back time.

45
00:02:23,561 --> 00:02:25,096
-Yes, Lollol! –Yes.

46
00:02:25,196 --> 00:02:26,397
-The second team. –Yes?

47
00:02:26,464 --> 00:02:28,265
The recent trend, the Easy Brothers.

48
00:02:28,365 --> 00:02:29,233
Easy!

49
00:02:29,533 --> 00:02:32,336
-Wow, he called them ‘trend’.-Feel! Touch! Cross!

50
00:02:32,403 --> 00:02:34,305
Ok, this is the third team.

51
00:02:34,371 --> 00:02:36,273
Yoo Jae Suk and Kim Jong Kook.

52
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:37,875
-What? –Wow, that’s too strong.

53
00:02:38,175 --> 00:02:40,811
I’m with someone who can’t see 5m ahead of him?

54
00:02:40,911 --> 00:02:42,413
No, we’re on the same team?

55
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,949
Jong Kook and I... hey.

56
00:02:45,049 --> 00:02:46,117
They’re too strong.

57
00:02:46,183 --> 00:02:48,752
If you can see 5m ahead and I control space, then...

58
00:02:48,819 --> 00:02:49,987
Then we’ll definitely win.

59
00:02:52,690 --> 00:03:00,598
Soon, arriving through the door, are five Korea’s hottest Hallyu idols.

60
00:03:00,664 --> 00:03:01,499
SNSD?

61
00:03:01,532 --> 00:03:04,768
-There will be one guest in each team. – Okay.

62
00:03:04,835 --> 00:03:07,972
Also, Ji Hyo especially has two of them.

63
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:10,074
Ah, I hope they’re girls.

64
00:03:10,107 --> 00:03:11,475
Give Ji Hyo two female guests.

65
00:03:11,642 --> 00:03:13,310
Extremely young kids.

66
00:03:13,377 --> 00:03:17,148
-The Hallyu idol on the same team as Gary and Haha will be revealed.

67
00:03:17,148 --> 00:03:19,884
Oh, it’s a female.

68
00:03:19,884 --> 00:03:21,352
Be my last love!

69
00:03:21,552 --> 00:03:23,053
For a guy like me the answer is you !

70
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,321
I’ll love you forever!

71
00:03:35,533 --> 00:03:36,800
-Oh, who is it, who is it? – Oh!

72
00:03:39,737 --> 00:03:40,671
Sulli?

73
00:03:40,738 --> 00:03:42,439
Sulli, it’sSulli!

74
00:03:48,279 --> 00:03:49,680
Oppa, you’re tired right?

75
00:03:49,747 --> 00:03:50,581
Where?

76
00:03:51,215 --> 00:03:53,884
Oppa, we did it!

77
00:03:54,585 --> 00:03:55,452
Who?

78
00:03:55,553 --> 00:03:57,888
-Wow! –Sulli, Sulli!

79
00:04:01,625 --> 00:04:02,860
Here

80
00:04:05,196 --> 00:04:06,363
The answer’s me.

81
00:04:06,597 --> 00:04:08,165
Ah, thanks Sulli!

82
00:04:08,566 --> 00:04:11,302
Sulli, it’s been so long.

83
00:04:11,368 --> 00:04:13,204
Why have you become even prettier?

84
00:04:13,237 --> 00:04:14,305
Sulli, where are you going?

85
00:04:14,405 --> 00:04:18,442
Sulli, we... where did you go after drinking the tea that other time?

86
00:04:25,849 --> 00:04:27,251
Where exactly did you go?

87
00:04:28,586 --> 00:04:32,122
-Ah, is Sulli in that team? –Ok, Sulli’s the best.

88
00:04:33,757 --> 00:04:36,560
Jong Kook, let’s have a look at ours.

89
00:04:38,095 --> 00:04:40,431
We won’t let your hands touch a single drop of water.

90
00:04:47,171 --> 00:04:48,072
Who is it?

91
00:04:52,009 --> 00:04:54,411
-Oh, it’s Sohee! –Sohee!

92
00:05:03,487 --> 00:05:05,823
Oh, it’s Sohee!

93
00:05:07,958 --> 00:05:09,226
It’s really been a long time.

94
00:05:09,593 --> 00:05:10,461
Hello.

95
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:11,428
Daebak!

96
00:05:11,595 --> 00:05:13,731
-You’re not welcoming her, you’re just like fans. –How so?

97
00:05:13,864 --> 00:05:16,100
-Your welcome is seriously like a fan. – Oh, Sohee.

98
00:05:17,101 --> 00:05:19,103
We seriously have not seen Sohee in a while?

99
00:05:23,374 --> 00:05:28,345
Hyung, it’s too awkward, welcoming like this.

100
00:05:28,379 --> 00:05:30,347
How can you let her feel out of place?

101
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:34,885
Have you prepared for transportation?

102
00:05:36,487 --> 00:05:37,888
If not, we...

103
00:05:37,955 --> 00:05:39,590
Come here Sohee.

104
00:05:44,328 --> 00:05:45,429
Oh, I’m really nervous.

105
00:05:45,529 --> 00:05:46,864
I haven’t done this for so long.

106
00:05:47,031 --> 00:05:49,333
Come out quickly!

107
00:06:01,979 --> 00:06:05,983
Oh, it’s Hyorin.

108
00:06:06,083 --> 00:06:07,051
Hello.

109
00:06:24,435 --> 00:06:25,436
Curious Who am I with?

110
00:06:25,536 --> 00:06:26,337
It’s us.

111
00:06:26,437 --> 00:06:28,539
Ah, it’s like this?

112
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:30,974
Ah, I ...

113
00:06:31,175 --> 00:06:34,611
-Don’t be like this. Ah, we’re no joke recently. –We’re the trend!

114
00:06:34,678 --> 00:06:36,747
-We even got first once. – Exactly, first.

115
00:06:36,814 --> 00:06:42,453
Ah I’m the newble here, so I wanted to come out first.

116
00:06:42,486 --> 00:06:44,388
I really didn’t want to be with oppas.

117
00:06:44,722 --> 00:06:47,057
What are you saying when we’ve just met?

118
00:06:47,124 --> 00:06:48,625
Hey, your voice is my age.

119
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:51,929
-I can only hear her voice. –Please look after me.

120
00:06:52,062 --> 00:06:53,430
Thank you.

121
00:06:54,698 --> 00:06:56,800
Ok, Ji Hyo’s alone!

122
00:06:56,934 --> 00:06:59,136
-Our Sohee’s totally at ease. –Hey, seems like it’s two guys.

123
00:06:59,236 --> 00:07:01,271
I think it will be two guys.

124
00:07:01,372 --> 00:07:02,506
I really have, two of them?

125
00:07:02,673 --> 00:07:05,042
It’s Min Ho?

126
00:07:33,871 --> 00:07:35,672
It’s Min Ho, Min Ho!

127
00:07:38,942 --> 00:07:41,779
Hey! Today, today we’ll definitely win.

128
00:07:41,845 --> 00:07:42,913
Hi Si Won. Hello.

129
00:07:46,283 --> 00:07:47,918
Hey, your expression’s really happy.

130
00:07:48,085 --> 00:07:50,854
Get lost, all of you!

131
00:07:50,954 --> 00:07:52,256
Get lost, all of you!

132
00:07:52,656 --> 00:07:53,757
Hello.

133
00:07:54,124 --> 00:07:55,159
Ah, Si Won!

134
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:01,231
Why are you like this to your dongsaengs?

135
00:08:01,298 --> 00:08:02,933
Don’t be annoying, get lost.

136
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:06,303
I’m really touched.

137
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:08,605
Be on the same team as noona.

138
00:08:08,672 --> 00:08:10,974
-What did Song Ji to be this lucky? – What, why aren’t you coming here?

139
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:13,544
You be quiet.

140
00:08:17,314 --> 00:08:20,651
Sohee,Sohee!

141
00:08:20,684 --> 00:08:25,389
-Hyorin, Hyorin!-Sulli, Sulli!

142
00:08:25,456 --> 00:08:27,024
Oh, today’s really too daebak.

143
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:29,927
Now we’ll explain today’s race.

144
00:08:30,127 --> 00:08:31,862
Today is the 1st of January.

145
00:08:31,862 --> 00:08:38,335
To celebrate filming the first race of the year, a Math Race.

146
00:08:38,368 --> 00:08:42,139
Pass each mission to get numbers.

147
00:08:42,206 --> 00:08:43,807
Using the numbers received

148
00:08:43,807 --> 00:08:47,744
the team who gets a final answer of 1 wins the Math Race

149
00:08:47,744 --> 00:08:49,112
We’ll start the race immediately.

150
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:50,814
We start running from now?

151
00:08:50,881 --> 00:08:54,651
Please set off directly for the carpark to receive your number cards.

152
00:08:54,685 --> 00:08:57,254
The faster you reach, the more numbers you can choose from.

153
00:08:57,287 --> 00:08:59,423
After choosing your number cards

154
00:08:59,423 --> 00:09:01,992
go directly to the first mission location.

155
00:09:02,025 --> 00:09:02,993
Ok, start!

156
00:09:05,329 --> 00:09:07,965
Let’s go!

157
00:09:07,998 --> 00:09:09,333
Where do we go, where?

158
00:09:10,534 --> 00:09:12,402
Quick. Hey quickly, quickly.

159
00:09:12,669 --> 00:09:14,137
Where do we go, where do we go?

160
00:09:15,005 --> 00:09:17,307
The carpark’s on the right

161
00:09:24,815 --> 00:09:26,783
Where do we go, where do we go?

162
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:28,185
Where are they going?

163
00:09:28,485 --> 00:09:29,620
The direction is wrong?

164
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:34,491
Didn’t you say you’re good at running?

165
00:09:34,558 --> 00:09:36,226
Ah, I can’t run because it’s too funny!

166
00:09:38,395 --> 00:09:39,263
Run !

167
00:09:42,366 --> 00:09:44,034
Let’s look over there.

168
00:09:55,212 --> 00:09:58,415
Excuse me, the person in the fur coat, move aside!

169
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,109
I was the first

170
00:10:59,109 --> 00:11:02,613
Hyung, it’s there! There!

171
00:11:02,713 --> 00:11:03,680
Don’t be excited.

172
00:11:03,747 --> 00:11:05,415
Don’t keep going straight. Look left and right.

173
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:08,785
Be careful, be careful!

174
00:11:08,986 --> 00:11:12,489
Excuse me, sorry! Sorry.

175
00:11:12,689 --> 00:11:14,791
Haha Hyung has already gone there.

176
00:11:14,825 --> 00:11:16,193
Where exactly did Suk Jin Hyung gone to?

177
00:11:18,929 --> 00:11:20,664
But this is amazing.

178
00:11:20,931 --> 00:11:24,534
I was really hoping not to be with you and Suk Jin oppa.

179
00:11:24,735 --> 00:11:26,570
What kind of words are these?

180
00:11:31,642 --> 00:11:33,677
Found it! It’s there!

181
00:11:33,744 --> 00:11:34,778
Faster! Faster!

182
00:11:38,281 --> 00:11:39,983
Okay, okay, okay.

183
00:11:40,183 --> 00:11:42,552
You guys are the first to arrive.

184
00:11:42,619 --> 00:11:44,955
Just choose two numbers from here.

185
00:11:49,693 --> 00:11:51,595
Let’s choose one and nine, hyung.

186
00:11:51,662 --> 00:11:53,497
One and nine? Won’t that be too far for substraction?

187
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:59,603
-Friends? –Friends, friends. –Five, four, three, two, one!

188
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:01,471
-We’ve decided. –Friends.

189
00:12:02,439 --> 00:12:04,374
Take it away, take it away.

190
00:12:04,408 --> 00:12:06,243
I came alone, it’s okay right?

191
00:12:06,309 --> 00:12:08,812
It’s okay, just choose on your own.

192
00:12:08,845 --> 00:12:13,183
Five, four, three, two, one.

193
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:14,618
Three, six.

194
00:12:18,355 --> 00:12:20,757
-Hyung, didn’t we calculate to get one? – We must get one.

195
00:12:20,791 --> 00:12:22,526
Then let’s choose neighbouring numbers.

196
00:12:22,526 --> 00:12:24,061
Four, five. Or, one, two.

197
00:12:24,227 --> 00:12:28,832
-The minus method is also counted. – Death’s four.

198
00:12:30,033 --> 00:12:33,570
-Why are yo so tough? – That’s too extreme.

199
00:12:33,637 --> 00:12:37,140
-Death’s four and the first one. –Okay.

200
00:12:38,442 --> 00:12:40,744
Why aren’t they coming? Thar team...

201
00:12:40,811 --> 00:12:43,180
They there. They’re coming right now. They’re running.

202
00:12:43,346 --> 00:12:45,582
You guys are quite a match.

203
00:12:45,649 --> 00:12:47,684
-You chose already? –I ran here.

204
00:12:49,052 --> 00:12:51,455
You did well.

205
00:12:52,289 --> 00:12:55,092
That team is really awkward, really!

206
00:12:55,125 --> 00:12:57,060
Talk to each other a little!

207
00:12:57,127 --> 00:12:59,196
Jong Kook, look!

208
00:12:59,229 --> 00:13:01,331
So you don’t know how we’ve become so close now?

209
00:13:54,084 --> 00:13:55,685
Are you worried? Or are you not?

210
00:13:55,786 --> 00:13:57,120
I’m very nervous right now.

211
00:13:57,154 --> 00:13:58,488
Really? Don’t be worried.

212
00:14:00,624 --> 00:14:02,926
-Okay, let’s go! Sulli, let’s go! – Go!

213
00:14:02,993 --> 00:14:05,762
Go!

214
00:14:05,862 --> 00:14:07,497
Let’s set off also.

215
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:13,403
Head to the "I" theme park in Bucheon and look for the Running Man flag.

216
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:19,843
Min Ho knows how to drive too?!

217
00:14:19,943 --> 00:14:23,513
Yes I can drive a little.

218
00:14:23,914 --> 00:14:26,016
-How old are you? – 21 years old.

219
00:14:26,049 --> 00:14:27,784
-20 years old? - 21 years old.

220
00:14:28,652 --> 00:14:29,953
How old is Si Won?

221
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:31,555
I was born in year ’87.

222
00:14:31,955 --> 00:14:34,191
How old is noona?

223
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:37,494
Min Ho and I have a ten year difference.

224
00:14:38,528 --> 00:14:40,831
-Liar! – Really.

225
00:14:41,031 --> 00:14:45,268
Isn’t noona just in her twenties?

226
00:14:46,203 --> 00:14:47,904
Noona is in her early thirties

227
00:14:48,605 --> 00:14:50,974
Noona really doesn’t look like it, really.

228
00:14:56,546 --> 00:14:58,849
When I think of coming to the show

229
00:14:58,849 --> 00:15:01,051
I really wanted to be in the same team as noona.

230
00:15:01,084 --> 00:15:02,185
-Really? – Yes.

231
00:15:02,485 --> 00:15:04,721
In Running Man, it’s been a long

232
00:15:04,754 --> 00:15:06,356
while since I’ve heard these typs of words.

233
00:15:06,389 --> 00:15:08,892
Whenever I watch the show, I’m always very sad.

234
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:12,596
If you have younger brothers to take care of you,

235
00:15:12,662 --> 00:15:15,565
All the oppas don’t look at me as a lady.

236
00:15:15,632 --> 00:15:19,035
-It doesn’t matter to me now. –When?

237
00:15:19,135 --> 00:15:22,205
Even when I see female guests, I also feel very happy.

238
00:15:24,474 --> 00:15:26,142
We chose 2 and 8 right?

239
00:15:26,877 --> 00:15:28,879
So we are going to get 1 later?

240
00:15:29,012 --> 00:15:33,216
-We can add and subtract to get it done... -Is it? –Yes, it is.

241
00:15:33,283 --> 00:15:35,952
-Maybe we can also use division... -Division.

242
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:44,728
Sohee,Sohee, Sohee.

243
00:15:45,762 --> 00:15:47,864
There might be a square root sigh also!

244
00:15:48,131 --> 00:15:52,869
What square root? I don’t like this, always being like this...

245
00:15:52,936 --> 00:15:54,271
Perhaps you don’t know square root?

246
00:15:54,337 --> 00:15:55,639
Of course I know it.

247
00:15:55,705 --> 00:15:57,774
But I think better not to use that.

248
00:15:57,841 --> 00:15:59,542
Want to try testing me using square root?

249
00:15:59,609 --> 00:16:03,313
Stop saying square root, stick to the simple ones.

250
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:05,148
The one everyone can use.

251
00:16:05,215 --> 00:16:06,583
But this is simple!

252
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:07,984
How’s it simple?

253
00:16:10,553 --> 00:16:13,056
Do you know what Sohee is saying in her mind?

254
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:15,725
Can you be a little quieter?

255
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,362
It’s also been a while...

256
00:16:19,462 --> 00:16:20,931
Why are you talking so much?

257
00:16:22,832 --> 00:16:24,100
Just... like that.

258
00:16:33,743 --> 00:16:39,082
Because it’s quiet, I feel more comfortable.

259
00:16:51,127 --> 00:16:53,663
Oh, we’ve found it, we’ve found it!

260
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:55,365
-Where? –Over there.

261
00:16:55,732 --> 00:16:57,500
I feel so happy seeing that thing.

262
00:16:58,668 --> 00:17:00,003
Let’s quickly get off the car!

263
00:17:01,338 --> 00:17:03,873
Oh! There isn’t anyone here yet?

264
00:17:04,441 --> 00:17:05,442
What is this?

265
00:17:05,642 --> 00:17:06,409
What is that?

266
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:10,113
-You see the airplanes here right? – Yes.

267
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:13,016
From now on, sit on the plane and go on a world tour.

268
00:17:13,283 --> 00:17:16,653
-Because you are a Hallyu star. –I see.

269
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,054
-During the flight

270
00:17:18,054 --> 00:17:19,622
you will pass by the miniature versions of Asia and the US.–Yes.

271
00:17:19,622 --> 00:17:23,693
Use your arms to make a horse to carry the female member.

272
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,862
Quickly travel around the US and Asia,

273
00:17:25,929 --> 00:17:28,264
And there would be a mission waiting for you.

274
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:33,470
Okay, then squat down.

275
00:17:33,503 --> 00:17:34,804
I’m sitting. Sorry.

276
00:17:35,672 --> 00:17:36,840
Min Ho, let’s go!

277
00:17:36,873 --> 00:17:38,708
-One, two, three! – Why are you so light?

278
00:17:38,842 --> 00:17:39,776
Noona, why are you so light?

279
00:17:39,843 --> 00:17:43,279
It doesn’t seem to even reach 60kg.

280
00:17:45,815 --> 00:17:47,050
Where are we going?

281
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:49,185
-Let’s go to the US first. –The US, go!

282
00:17:49,519 --> 00:17:52,222
-Noona is really light. –Really light!

283
00:17:52,288 --> 00:17:54,924
This is really good , you’re very light!

284
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:56,226
I’m so sorry, really.

285
00:17:56,292 --> 00:17:58,261
This is really amazing, you’re really very light!

286
00:17:58,528 --> 00:18:00,363
Oh, they are miniatures.

287
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:11,341
Great wall of China!Great wall of China!

288
00:18:11,408 --> 00:18:14,210
-I’ve also seen the Great wall of China special! – Ni Hao

289
00:18:14,811 --> 00:18:16,146
Over there!

290
00:18:16,212 --> 00:18:17,113
We’ve found it!

291
00:18:17,347 --> 00:18:18,481
That, right

292
00:18:24,821 --> 00:18:26,189
Over there! Running Man.

293
00:18:26,256 --> 00:18:27,457
-Where? –There, there.

294
00:18:27,524 --> 00:18:29,125
Okay, please put me down now!

295
00:18:29,192 --> 00:18:32,562
-Airplane landing! – One, two, three, swoosh

296
00:18:32,962 --> 00:18:36,366
As expected, different from our members.

297
00:18:37,233 --> 00:18:39,903
-You’ve just finish your Asia-USA tour, -Yes.

298
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:43,973
At the United States area you’ve just passed,

299
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,876
How many buildings were shorter than Haha?

300
00:18:49,045 --> 00:18:50,213
What?

301
00:18:50,713 --> 00:18:52,282
I’ll give you 5 seconds.

302
00:18:52,348 --> 00:18:54,484
Five, four

303
00:18:54,517 --> 00:18:55,485
White house!

304
00:18:55,518 --> 00:18:58,288
Three, two,

305
00:18:58,421 --> 00:19:00,723
-Quickly say it. – Two, two, two!

306
00:19:01,524 --> 00:19:03,126
What are names of those two?

307
00:19:03,326 --> 00:19:05,628
-Yes, what are the names? –Five.

308
00:19:05,695 --> 00:19:07,163
-Four, -Wait a minute.

309
00:19:07,263 --> 00:19:08,565
Three,

310
00:19:08,665 --> 00:19:10,166
-Library? –Two.

311
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,268
-What is it? I even forgot the name. – One.

312
00:19:12,335 --> 00:19:14,270
Head back to the starting point, set off.

313
00:19:15,371 --> 00:19:16,473
Can’t be.

314
00:19:16,706 --> 00:19:20,543
-Oh, look at this, look at this. –Sohee, Sohee.

315
00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:21,744
Has the feeling come?

316
00:19:22,345 --> 00:19:25,281
We’ve already arrived, haven’t we?

317
00:19:25,381 --> 00:19:27,717
-Because you came with a Hallyu star. –Yes

318
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:30,320
Now sit on the airplane and travel around the world.

319
00:19:33,756 --> 00:19:35,225
Even Sohee is laughing.

320
00:19:35,291 --> 00:19:36,359
Private airplane?

321
00:19:36,392 --> 00:19:37,794
-They have already arrived? –Where?

322
00:19:37,861 --> 00:19:39,696
They have already arrived, we must hurry.

323
00:19:39,996 --> 00:19:41,531
You guys have already gone and came back?

324
00:19:41,564 --> 00:19:42,799
It’s not a joke, oppa.

325
00:19:42,832 --> 00:19:47,270
These boys all still young. They carried me easily.

326
00:19:47,337 --> 00:19:52,709
-Youth is life. –Ah, this ajummah, what you’ve said is so exaggerating...

327
00:19:52,775 --> 00:19:54,844
Then let’s see how light Sohee is.

328
00:19:55,678 --> 00:19:58,548
Really very light, surprisingly lighter than what I’ve imagined.

329
00:19:58,648 --> 00:20:01,184
-Yah, we are... -Stop joking.

330
00:20:01,217 --> 00:20:02,085
Really.

331
00:20:02,285 --> 00:20:04,454
-Hey, is she really light? –She really is.

332
00:20:04,487 --> 00:20:07,924
-Have a good look! –We will carry Sohee up to fly, take a good look!

333
00:20:07,957 --> 00:20:11,561
Sohee, you must move around the wings like this.

334
00:20:12,228 --> 00:20:14,564
After that, do this.

335
00:20:15,932 --> 00:20:17,400
Ah, really...

336
00:20:18,101 --> 00:20:20,970
-Our team, our team. – Ah, really...

337
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:22,539
Right, and then...

338
00:20:22,605 --> 00:20:24,707
-What are you doing right now? –Ah, seriously.

339
00:20:24,807 --> 00:20:26,042
Ah seriously, really.

340
00:20:28,211 --> 00:20:29,812
One, two, three.

341
00:20:31,114 --> 00:20:32,182
Let’s move.

342
00:20:32,348 --> 00:20:33,550
Set off.

343
00:20:33,616 --> 00:20:35,618
Oh it’s done, it’s done.

344
00:20:35,885 --> 00:20:37,020
-Hey, we’re flying! –Sohee, is it fun?

345
00:20:37,086 --> 00:20:37,887
Yes!

346
00:20:38,154 --> 00:20:42,492
-Sohee. –Hey, this is totally flying.

347
00:20:42,525 --> 00:20:44,194
This can totally fly.

348
00:20:44,294 --> 00:20:46,129
Hey, we can see their legs shaking.

349
00:20:46,329 --> 00:20:47,697
You’re lagging behind.

350
00:20:47,764 --> 00:20:49,199
Hey, Sohee’s really very light.

351
00:20:50,266 --> 00:20:53,203
It’s totally flying, flying.

352
00:20:53,369 --> 00:20:55,071
It’s like taking a plane.

353
00:20:55,138 --> 00:20:57,740
-Ah hyung, we have to hurry, hyung. – Oh, we can’t fall behind.

354
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,275
Min Ho’s tired.

355
00:20:59,542 --> 00:21:00,643
No, that’s not it.

356
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:02,912
Ji Hyo noona’s very light.

357
00:21:03,213 --> 00:21:05,381
Look at Jae Suk hyung’s legs now.

358
00:21:05,481 --> 00:21:07,550
Jae Suk hyung’s legs are wobbling!

359
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:09,152
Jae Suk hyung’s legs!

360
00:21:10,153 --> 00:21:12,155
Where is it?

361
00:21:13,423 --> 00:21:16,392
-Why is it so far? – It’s really huge!

362
00:21:16,492 --> 00:21:17,727
Over there.

363
00:21:17,994 --> 00:21:19,462
Isn’t it here?

364
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:22,031
-I’m sorry. –No.

365
00:21:22,198 --> 00:21:23,900
Hyung, we didn’t look around on our way here?

366
00:21:23,933 --> 00:21:24,701
I didn’t see anything.

367
00:21:26,102 --> 00:21:27,170
It’s over.

368
00:21:28,705 --> 00:21:31,741
Ok. Should I give the questions or not?

369
00:21:31,941 --> 00:21:32,976
Give it of course.

370
00:21:33,243 --> 00:21:36,112
-You’re starting again. –No, you seem like you didn’t notice anything.

371
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,315
-In the US Zone... -Yes.

372
00:21:39,382 --> 00:21:43,219
-How many structures are shorter than Haha? –Huh?

373
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,635
-Hyung, what are you saying? – You seem to have more muscles than Jong Kook hyung.

374
00:22:35,505 --> 00:22:36,406
It’s done, it’s done.

375
00:22:36,506 --> 00:22:37,140
Good.

376
00:22:37,206 --> 00:22:38,775
-Ok, let’s go too! –What are you guys doing?

377
00:22:38,841 --> 00:22:39,909
Min Ho, what are you guys doing?

378
00:22:40,476 --> 00:22:41,377
What’s with you?

379
00:22:41,477 --> 00:22:44,747
Now you’re, now you’re like this with guys when I’m not around?

380
00:22:44,814 --> 00:22:47,450
-It’s Tuesday today! –Ah yes, I’m sorry.

381
00:22:47,583 --> 00:22:50,286
-Do you know what’s our relationship? We’re friends. –Friends.

382
00:22:50,353 --> 00:22:54,123
-Firstly, our mental age is extremely similar. –Five, six.

383
00:22:54,123 --> 00:22:58,828
Jump around.

384
00:22:58,895 --> 00:23:01,798
-Looks good. –Now do you hear the sounds of Haha’s short tongue?

385
00:23:01,898 --> 00:23:04,100
"Hup, Hup!"Oh, I really can’t take it.

386
00:23:04,133 --> 00:23:09,706
-don’t you know? I have a short tongue. –Omoomo.

387
00:23:12,041 --> 00:23:13,943
-My back. –Don’t swing, don’t swing your legs!

388
00:23:13,976 --> 00:23:16,179
Don’t do that!

389
00:23:18,848 --> 00:23:21,117
-You went past Asia and US right? –Yes.

390
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:25,221
-In the US Zone, how many structures are shorter than Haha?

391
00:23:25,221 --> 00:23:27,557
Shorter than Haha?

392
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:29,525
--Shorter than Haha? –Five...

393
00:23:29,559 --> 00:23:30,293
Four...

394
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:31,728
-Did you see? – You should have seen it.

395
00:23:31,828 --> 00:23:33,029
-Two... -I didn’t see.

396
00:23:33,062 --> 00:23:34,130
-Iwas laughing. –Empire State Building!

397
00:23:34,163 --> 00:23:35,164
Four

398
00:23:35,565 --> 00:23:37,066
-That’s wrong –No.

399
00:23:37,133 --> 00:23:38,534
Please set off again.

400
00:23:38,601 --> 00:23:41,804
-Will this question remain the same? –Set off!

401
00:23:42,271 --> 00:23:45,274
-Hey, he just won’t answer you. –He won’t answer.

402
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:46,743
Is this ok, like this?

403
00:23:46,776 --> 00:23:48,244
-No. – How should I sit on your shoulders?

404
00:23:48,277 --> 00:23:49,679
-That’s right, don’t move. –Like this?

405
00:23:49,746 --> 00:23:51,581
Don your feet hurt? I think your shoulders must be aching.

406
00:23:51,647 --> 00:23:52,949
Ah, just stop asking

407
00:23:53,116 --> 00:23:55,351
-Ah, it’s hot! –Hey Sulli.

408
00:23:55,418 --> 00:23:56,552
Yes, yes.

409
00:24:00,022 --> 00:24:01,524
Sulli, your oppa can’t do it.

410
00:24:01,924 --> 00:24:06,462
In the US zone, how many structures are shorter than Haha?

411
00:24:06,529 --> 00:24:09,499
-No, this height now? –Three...

412
00:24:09,565 --> 00:24:10,433
Two...

413
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:11,467
Three.

414
00:24:12,034 --> 00:24:13,236
One. That’s wrong.

415
00:24:13,302 --> 00:24:14,904
Please return to the starting point.

416
00:24:15,037 --> 00:24:19,375
In the US zone, how many structures are shorter than Haha?

417
00:24:19,475 --> 00:24:20,576
The same question?

418
00:24:21,611 --> 00:24:23,312
Why are you asking it again?

419
00:24:23,379 --> 00:24:24,213
One!

420
00:24:24,447 --> 00:24:25,948
-Ah, hang on for awhile. –That’s wrong.

421
00:24:26,015 --> 00:24:27,083
-Ah, why did you answer on your own?

422
00:24:27,083 --> 00:24:30,186
Ok, return to the starting point again.

423
00:24:30,219 --> 00:24:31,888
There are three.

424
00:24:31,954 --> 00:24:32,989
Say it softly, say it softly.

425
00:24:33,089 --> 00:24:35,324
The first one, the Grand Central Station.

426
00:24:35,425 --> 00:24:37,293
Also, the Lincoln Memorial.

427
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,228
Also, the White House.

428
00:24:40,797 --> 00:24:41,931
One is wrong.

429
00:24:42,398 --> 00:24:44,333
What did you say?

430
00:24:56,579 --> 00:24:58,214
You can’t land there.

431
00:24:58,281 --> 00:25:00,216
-No, we were waiting! –Ah, yes.

432
00:25:00,283 --> 00:25:03,519
Ah, how many, how many times have we been here.

433
00:25:03,786 --> 00:25:04,754
Saw that?

434
00:25:06,255 --> 00:25:11,627
-Saw that? –She watched our show, you’ll get shaken by the collar.

435
00:25:13,196 --> 00:25:17,333
In the scene from the Battle of Hansan, how many Turtle Ships were there?

436
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,534
Oh my god!

437
00:25:20,303 --> 00:25:23,639
-What’s that? –Two Turtle Ships.

438
00:25:23,739 --> 00:25:26,442
-And then? –Seven... -That’s right.

439
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:29,011
Oh my god!

440
00:25:29,579 --> 00:25:31,047
Sohee, how many?

441
00:25:31,113 --> 00:25:32,281
One, two, three!

442
00:25:32,348 --> 00:25:33,449
Two!

443
00:25:34,617 --> 00:25:35,651
Correct.

444
00:25:39,355 --> 00:25:40,523
We did it.

445
00:25:41,791 --> 00:25:44,193
-Hey, what’s this? –You’re the first to pass!

446
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:47,563
-Do you see these numbers in front of you? –Yes.

447
00:25:47,663 --> 00:25:50,566
Pick two, from these numbers.

448
00:25:50,933 --> 00:25:52,635
We picked 2 and 8 earlier.

449
00:25:52,869 --> 00:25:53,803
Yes.

450
00:25:54,170 --> 00:25:55,771
Don’t we have to make ‘1’?

451
00:25:56,105 --> 00:25:57,840
So just take 1.

452
00:26:00,009 --> 00:26:01,677
What are you up to?

453
00:26:01,744 --> 00:26:02,712
We have to make ‘1’.

454
00:26:02,778 --> 00:26:05,114
-We have to get 1 but ... -We have to make ‘1’ so let’s take 1 and go.

455
00:26:05,147 --> 00:26:08,484
No, but there will be some addition and subtraction or something like that.

456
00:26:08,618 --> 00:26:10,820
-Ah, this is seriously... -7?

457
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,555
So 7?

458
00:26:15,157 --> 00:26:16,626
3?

459
00:26:19,595 --> 00:26:21,964
-How about a ‘2’? –Sorry.

460
00:26:22,365 --> 00:26:24,166
Sohee, just pick whichever one you want.

461
00:26:24,233 --> 00:26:26,102
-Hey, let’s turn around. –So we don’t know what Sohee does.

462
00:26:26,402 --> 00:26:27,503
Ah, do what do you want.

463
00:26:28,538 --> 00:26:29,972
Ok, 4 and 7.

464
00:26:30,072 --> 00:26:31,340
Why did you choose 4 and 7?

465
00:26:31,507 --> 00:26:34,343
This is because, we picked 2 and 8 earlier.

466
00:26:34,443 --> 00:26:37,413
-If we subtract 7 we get 1.–Equals 1.

467
00:26:37,446 --> 00:26:41,784
When we divide 4 we get 2.

468
00:26:41,817 --> 00:26:43,452
When we divide 4 we get 2.

469
00:26:44,954 --> 00:26:47,523
-Seems like it’s not it?–Let’s go first.

470
00:26:48,024 --> 00:26:51,160
-Hey, you don’t seem very satisfied? –Ah, what are you saying?

471
00:26:51,394 --> 00:26:55,464
Math Race. Next, find the Running Man banner at the eatery.

472
00:26:55,565 --> 00:26:58,167
-P Vietnamese eatery. –Let’s go.

473
00:26:58,334 --> 00:26:59,368
Ok!

474
00:26:59,635 --> 00:27:03,072
-Sohee, now you’re really... -My desire to win is burning now.

475
00:27:04,273 --> 00:27:05,975
I can see it burning.

476
00:27:06,342 --> 00:27:09,178
You’re gradually becoming more enthusiastic.

477
00:27:09,445 --> 00:27:11,047
This is rather difficult.

478
00:27:13,182 --> 00:27:16,385
-Seems like it’s something to do with eating. –It looks like it, an eating mission.

479
00:27:19,589 --> 00:27:20,523
It’s all right.

480
00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:22,725
Don’t be afraid. It’s all right, it’s all right.

481
00:27:22,825 --> 00:27:25,027
-It’s all right. –Hello.

482
00:27:27,863 --> 00:27:29,732
I’m filming.

483
00:27:32,301 --> 00:27:34,904
It seems like we’ll be eating while filming.

484
00:27:36,939 --> 00:27:38,407
Yes, it’s interesting.

485
00:27:39,709 --> 00:27:42,044
What a relief.

486
00:27:44,614 --> 00:27:47,016
-It’s my dad. –Ah, so it’s your father.

487
00:27:48,217 --> 00:27:51,587
-Hey, he must also be, calling to see if you can eat well while filming.

488
00:27:51,587 --> 00:27:53,055
That’s right.

489
00:27:53,089 --> 00:27:57,526
Yes I told my father that I’d be filming today.

490
00:27:57,627 --> 00:27:59,795
"Oh, I’m filming Running Man today."

491
00:27:59,895 --> 00:28:02,398
-Dad wad like, ‘Oh, really?’ He likes it a lot. –Ah, really?

492
00:28:02,465 --> 00:28:04,934
-My dad likes watching it a lot. –Ah, is that so?

493
00:28:05,368 --> 00:28:09,505
Ah, even you father’s supporting us.

494
00:28:09,772 --> 00:28:11,207
We have to work hard.

495
00:28:11,374 --> 00:28:12,742
We must work hard to win.

496
00:28:15,845 --> 00:28:17,713
I feel we should take 3 and 6.

497
00:28:18,047 --> 00:28:22,485
-How about we take 1? -1 and 9.

498
00:28:22,551 --> 00:28:24,086
So let’s take 1 and 9, 1 and 9.

499
00:28:24,353 --> 00:28:25,655
1 and 9, I chose 1 and 9 too.

500
00:28:29,592 --> 00:28:32,662
Take the smallest one, then take the middle one.

501
00:28:32,795 --> 00:28:35,431
2,5,2,5*!

502
00:28:35,898 --> 00:28:37,900
-Please choose. –What about 8 and 3, 8 and 3?

503
00:28:37,967 --> 00:28:39,869
8 and 3. Because 8 times 3 is 24?

504
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:51,747
-We’re now going to an Italian restaurant. –Yes.

505
00:28:51,814 --> 00:28:54,216
-There’s definitely an eating mission at the restaurant. –Yes.

506
00:28:54,250 --> 00:29:00,322
-For instance memorizing, the order of food presented to us.

507
00:29:00,322 --> 00:29:01,891
So we just have to remember everything then?

508
00:29:01,891 --> 00:29:05,761
Firstly, we’re not just there for eating!

509
00:29:07,863 --> 00:29:12,835
So that means we should pay attention until we leave the restaurant?

510
00:29:14,603 --> 00:29:16,105
Min Ho’s tensing up

511
00:29:19,041 --> 00:29:20,876
Noona’s really very light!

512
00:29:20,976 --> 00:29:22,344
Oh, today’s really daebak.

513
00:29:23,846 --> 00:29:25,681
Oh, it’s here.

514
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:39,595
-It’s here, here. –Running Man, Running Man!

515
00:29:39,895 --> 00:29:42,398
-That’s right, so we’re the first. –Hurry.

516
00:29:42,631 --> 00:29:43,733
Here?

517
00:29:43,766 --> 00:29:44,800
Hello!

518
00:29:45,034 --> 00:29:46,435
Oh, what’s this?

519
00:29:46,469 --> 00:29:47,503
Hyorin, Sistar.

520
00:29:52,742 --> 00:29:55,111
-Today’s the New Year special. –Yes!

521
00:29:55,211 --> 00:29:59,381
-They’re messages sent in from international fans. –Ah, seriously?

522
00:29:59,982 --> 00:30:04,754
It’s written for our members as well as the guests that have come on the show.

523
00:30:04,854 --> 00:30:07,256
Hey, dumpling Sohee.

524
00:30:07,289 --> 00:30:10,092
Show us the power of the Commander.

525
00:30:11,093 --> 00:30:13,362
Hey, we’re seriously grateful.

526
00:30:18,434 --> 00:30:19,535
What’s this?

527
00:30:20,035 --> 00:30:22,972
Please think carefully before ordering.

528
00:30:23,072 --> 00:30:24,740
-WhenIwatched, it’s about eating sequence.

529
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:26,542
Of course. Right, that could be it.

530
00:30:26,575 --> 00:30:28,944
Just eat whatever you want to eat because it’s the new year

531
00:30:28,978 --> 00:30:30,880
Wow, seriously? We can eat what we want?

532
00:30:31,213 --> 00:30:33,716
So Hee was just on the phone with her dad.

533
00:30:33,783 --> 00:30:35,384
She said there would be food to eat while filming.

534
00:30:36,252 --> 00:30:39,321
Order something delicious, order whatever you want to eat.

535
00:30:39,388 --> 00:30:40,456
Sohee, what do you want to eat?

536
00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:43,793
This one and B1.

537
00:30:43,859 --> 00:30:46,061
Ah, fried chicken drumettes with garlic sauce.

538
00:30:46,295 --> 00:30:47,363
Don’t order that.

539
00:30:47,663 --> 00:30:49,064
Why order chicken drumettes?

540
00:30:50,733 --> 00:30:53,035
I got it. Ah, you’re seriously...

541
00:30:53,602 --> 00:30:55,304
Ah, you’re just...

542
00:30:55,437 --> 00:30:57,940
I just want to eat chicken wings, why must you interfere?

543
00:30:58,007 --> 00:31:00,376
The team leader isn’t settled.

544
00:31:00,442 --> 00:31:02,611
Ah, our stances are too different.

545
00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:05,714
-Between us, it’s rather... -Our views are very different.

546
00:31:05,748 --> 00:31:07,483
Yes, the way we talk is also different.

547
00:31:07,817 --> 00:31:12,021
-Ah, his driving style doesn’t match mine too. –It doesn’t match.

548
00:31:12,054 --> 00:31:14,023
Ah, seriously.

549
00:31:25,467 --> 00:31:27,469
Oh, they all seem to be here.

550
00:31:27,803 --> 00:31:28,604
All your dishes are here.

551
00:31:28,671 --> 00:31:29,672
Yes, yes!

552
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:33,475
Ah man, so fragrant.

553
00:31:33,509 --> 00:31:34,844
It really looks good.

554
00:31:35,544 --> 00:31:36,879
Ah, thank you.

555
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:42,117
Chicken curry fried rice, spicy seafood fried rice.

556
00:31:42,151 --> 00:31:45,154
And how about Ansung’s beef with rice noodles?

557
00:31:45,254 --> 00:31:46,555
Did you say Ansung beef?

558
00:31:46,956 --> 00:31:49,558
Anshim(tenderioin), anshim beef with rice noodles.

559
00:31:49,592 --> 00:31:51,360
What are you doing continuing to order nonsense?

560
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:52,294
Three.

561
00:31:52,761 --> 00:31:53,863
Ah, so tasty.

562
00:32:00,603 --> 00:32:02,438
Ah, these are all foreigners?

563
00:32:03,339 --> 00:32:04,073
Really?

564
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:06,842
She’s known as "Song Ji Hyo the Ace".

565
00:32:08,043 --> 00:32:09,945
"Ji Suk Jin’s singing is not too bad."

566
00:32:12,414 --> 00:32:14,617
"I nominate Lee Kwang Soo to be Spy."

567
00:32:15,751 --> 00:32:16,785
I love you.

568
00:32:17,853 --> 00:32:20,222
Oppa, look at this one.

569
00:32:20,289 --> 00:32:23,392
"Yesterday I saw you as a person." Gary.

570
00:32:25,861 --> 00:32:27,863
He said I look like a person.

571
00:32:28,297 --> 00:32:30,566
Before both teams finish their food,

572
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:39,675
List the areas you hope the opposing team will change from last year.

573
00:32:39,742 --> 00:32:40,976
-To each other? –Yes.

574
00:32:41,043 --> 00:32:44,747
But is one team finishes eating, the exchange ends.

575
00:32:44,847 --> 00:32:48,450
The more you say about each other the more advantageous it is.

576
00:32:48,784 --> 00:32:50,486
We have to eat fast.

577
00:32:50,819 --> 00:32:53,789
Do we start now?

578
00:32:53,856 --> 00:32:57,626
-Yes. –I wish Jae Suk Hyung would get rid of everything but green.

579
00:32:57,893 --> 00:32:59,595
-Iwish Jae Suk oppa would throw away his glasses.

580
00:32:59,595 --> 00:33:01,797
I wish Jong Kook gets rid of his muscles.

581
00:33:01,797 --> 00:33:03,599
I wish Jong Kook wouldn’t hit people.

582
00:33:03,666 --> 00:33:05,634
I wish Sohee won’t be pretty ever.

583
00:33:05,701 --> 00:33:07,603
I wish Sohee would get rid of that team

584
00:33:07,770 --> 00:33:09,571
I wish Haha oppa would throw away his shoe lifts.

585
00:33:13,642 --> 00:33:15,044
Hey, don’t you know I don’t wear them?

586
00:33:21,283 --> 00:33:22,418
Hey, how old are you?

587
00:33:22,518 --> 00:33:24,620
Hey, you’re so childish.

588
00:33:26,722 --> 00:33:31,527
-But Sohee... -No Sohee, Sohee speaks very softly but they hit hard.

589
00:33:32,161 --> 00:33:35,364
-I wish Jae Suk oppa wouldn’t make the clucking sound. –Oh, how...

590
00:33:36,265 --> 00:33:37,933
-How did you know that? Oh!

591
00:33:37,933 --> 00:33:40,769
I wish you wouldn’t stick your tongue out while eating.

592
00:33:40,769 --> 00:33:43,072
-Iwish Jae Suk hyung wouldn’t pull his pants so high. –Oh, oh?

593
00:33:43,105 --> 00:33:45,874
I wish Jong Kook oppa got rid of the velns on the back of his arm.

594
00:33:46,141 --> 00:33:50,012
Ok Gary, I wish he’d give up his position as the Ultimates Survivor.

595
00:33:50,112 --> 00:33:52,715
I wish Jae Suk oppa would get rid of the grain of rice on his left hand.

596
00:33:52,748 --> 00:33:53,716
Where were we?

597
00:33:57,786 --> 00:34:00,856
I want you to stop locking yourself every midnights to watch videos.

598
00:34:05,094 --> 00:34:07,396
There’s no more hard disk space left to store them.

599
00:34:07,663 --> 00:34:09,665
-I’m going crazy. –Throw them all away.

600
00:34:13,728 --> 00:34:17,330
I wish Si Won, would get rid of his tendency to act cool.

601
00:34:19,475 --> 00:34:21,510
I wish Min Ho wouldn’t be so noisy when exercising.

602
00:34:25,014 --> 00:34:26,982
Ah, I didn’t do that.

603
00:34:29,385 --> 00:34:31,620
Firstly, I don’t like Kwang Soo hyung’s dressing.

604
00:34:32,087 --> 00:34:37,926
Someone said he wears leggings and short T-shirts.

605
00:34:39,028 --> 00:34:40,195
How could you do that, Kwang Soo?

606
00:34:41,563 --> 00:34:42,698
Why did you do that?

607
00:34:43,565 --> 00:34:45,567
Hey, you’re on our side.

608
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:50,072
We’ve finished all our food.

609
00:34:50,372 --> 00:34:55,377
Ok, this team can’t say anything about Yoo Jae Suk’s team anymore

610
00:34:56,412 --> 00:34:57,379
Haha!

611
00:34:57,646 --> 00:34:59,681
-I want you to stop your obsessing with beautiful stars.

612
00:35:00,416 --> 00:35:02,918
if you get rid of yours first.

613
00:35:03,085 --> 00:35:04,653
I wish you’d get rid of your mic.

614
00:35:04,787 --> 00:35:08,223
You want me to stop talking? She’s really good.

615
00:35:08,457 --> 00:35:11,794
I wish you’d remove one stroke from ‘Haha’.

616
00:35:12,061 --> 00:35:13,128
Heehee?

617
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:21,470
I wish you’d throw away wet tissue after using it.

618
00:35:21,804 --> 00:35:23,372
Ah, yes, I’m sorry.

619
00:35:24,106 --> 00:35:26,341
Have you all finished?

620
00:35:26,408 --> 00:35:27,376
We’re all done!

621
00:35:27,576 --> 00:35:28,777
I’ll give you the mission.

622
00:35:29,078 --> 00:35:33,549
Everyone, will write down everything the other party

623
00:35:33,549 --> 00:35:35,150
said about you onto the memo notes and stick it onto yourself.

624
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:39,321
When the music’s playing, dance around to shake them all off.

625
00:35:39,455 --> 00:35:42,925
Jae Suk has 16 pieces.

626
00:35:43,025 --> 00:35:44,293
So Hee has 6 pieces.

627
00:35:44,493 --> 00:35:46,695
Kim Jong Kook has 16 pieces.

628
00:35:46,895 --> 00:35:49,832
-Why do I have so many? –All of them have to be shaken off to succeed.

629
00:35:49,865 --> 00:35:50,732
I got it.

630
00:35:50,933 --> 00:35:52,367
I have confidence in this event.

631
00:35:52,501 --> 00:35:54,803
-Hyung, I’ll paste it for you. –Ah, yes, I got it.

632
00:35:54,870 --> 00:35:57,840
-Ah, stick it on lightly!-Ah, yes, I know, I got it seumdwa!

633
00:36:01,310 --> 00:36:03,112
Ah, why do I have so many?

634
00:36:03,312 --> 00:36:05,180
There’s really ‘rice grain’.

635
00:36:05,314 --> 00:36:07,316
Ah, what’s with this ‘rice grain’?

636
00:36:07,449 --> 00:36:08,917
-Ah, you didn’t eat your rice.

637
00:36:08,917 --> 00:36:10,919
Ah, didn’t I eat it when Sulli said it, why is it still being pasted on?

638
00:36:12,387 --> 00:36:14,823
Hey, throwing away my passion, throwing away the ‘Grassshopper’, what do I still have left?

639
00:36:15,023 --> 00:36:17,726
-Well, what should I do? – Live as a shell now!

640
00:36:18,093 --> 00:36:19,928
I’m seriously going crazy.

641
00:36:19,995 --> 00:36:22,397
Blood vessels.

642
00:36:22,564 --> 00:36:25,567
Hitting people, eating fast.

643
00:36:25,601 --> 00:36:26,702
Hey, protein...

644
00:36:27,769 --> 00:36:29,238
We’ll start the music.

645
00:36:42,752 --> 00:36:43,760
They’ve all fallen off right?

646
00:36:52,594 --> 00:36:54,062
Ah, hurry up!

647
00:36:55,097 --> 00:36:57,132
Ah hurry, hurry!

648
00:36:57,466 --> 00:37:01,003
Ah, this won’t come off.

649
00:37:01,236 --> 00:37:03,172
Ah, why can’t you get this off?

650
00:37:03,605 --> 00:37:03,939
Hey, ‘pretty’ just won’t come off, Sohee.

651
00:37:06,575 --> 00:37:08,243
Looks like you can’t change your face!

652
00:37:08,377 --> 00:37:09,845
Truly, ‘chest up’ isn’t coming off.

653
00:37:24,193 --> 00:37:25,694
Oh, seems like they’ve all come off.

654
00:37:25,928 --> 00:37:30,132
Oh, like this, like this! Hey, do this!

655
00:37:43,011 --> 00:37:44,246
There’s still one left!

656
00:37:44,379 --> 00:37:45,447
Come off!

657
00:37:45,581 --> 00:37:46,949
Please!

658
00:37:47,816 --> 00:37:49,318
Please come off!

659
00:37:53,121 --> 00:37:54,389
Oppa, there are three.

660
00:37:56,959 --> 00:37:58,694
-Hyung, what are you...-Ok, done.

661
00:38:07,603 --> 00:38:09,171
Hey, get off quickly!

662
00:38:14,610 --> 00:38:16,845
Hey, get off quickly!

663
00:38:21,583 --> 00:38:23,485
Why won’t the one on hat come off?

664
00:38:40,402 --> 00:38:41,503
Done.

665
00:38:42,137 --> 00:38:43,171
Good one.

666
00:38:43,705 --> 00:38:46,508
-Let’s, not stick them on glasses! –It’s done, it’s done.

667
00:38:49,011 --> 00:38:50,746
Ah, this is seriously...

668
00:38:51,046 --> 00:38:53,148
Are you doing a perm?

669
00:38:53,849 --> 00:38:55,584
Hey, you’re giving me a perm!

670
00:38:55,784 --> 00:38:57,786
-Are you getting a straight perm? –This is a straight perm.

671
00:38:57,886 --> 00:38:59,121
Don’t do it, Haha.

672
00:38:59,688 --> 00:39:00,822
It’s done.

673
00:39:03,325 --> 00:39:04,326
Start!

674
00:39:08,030 --> 00:39:10,465
Oh, it’s so scary.

675
00:39:10,565 --> 00:39:13,335
Jong Kook hyung’s so scary.

676
00:39:23,645 --> 00:39:25,747
Wow, Jong Kook hyung’s really scary.

677
00:39:43,398 --> 00:39:45,467
There’s one under your cap, under your cap!

678
00:39:45,534 --> 00:39:46,068
Where?

679
00:39:46,068 --> 00:39:47,102
Under your cap!

680
00:39:47,703 --> 00:39:48,704
Do it to the front!

681
00:39:58,046 --> 00:39:58,914
Good!

682
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:02,217
I’m not going to be bouncing around, I’m really going to dance.

683
00:40:02,284 --> 00:40:03,285
I’m going to have fun.

684
00:40:04,353 --> 00:40:07,923
Ready, start!

685
00:40:09,791 --> 00:40:12,194
Ah, these aren’t falling off! Oh, my shoe!

686
00:40:29,778 --> 00:40:31,246
I got a shock!

687
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:33,281
Be careful, you might get hit.

688
00:40:41,356 --> 00:40:42,791
Pass!

689
00:40:44,393 --> 00:40:47,229
We did well.

690
00:40:47,362 --> 00:40:50,432
We did really well.

691
00:40:53,468 --> 00:40:55,771
Sohee, you’re happy, aren’t you?

692
00:41:00,675 --> 00:41:02,277
Let’s choose the start and the end.

693
00:41:09,184 --> 00:41:10,585
This is the mission.

694
00:41:19,461 --> 00:41:20,362
I’m done.

695
00:41:35,811 --> 00:41:37,546
Are we done?It has all dropped.

696
00:41:37,813 --> 00:41:38,747
Success!

697
00:41:45,153 --> 00:41:46,388
What shall we choose?

698
00:41:47,689 --> 00:41:48,590
2,4.

699
00:41:50,425 --> 00:41:51,860
-What should we choose? -5,6.

700
00:41:51,927 --> 00:41:53,195
We choose 5,6.

701
00:42:09,311 --> 00:42:10,579
Ok, we’re here.

702
00:42:12,481 --> 00:42:15,984
What are you doing here, PD?

703
00:42:17,652 --> 00:42:20,689
Use the numbers you have received so far to form the number 1.

704
00:42:20,755 --> 00:42:22,924
You need to find at least 8 operations.

705
00:42:22,991 --> 00:42:24,693
The cards on the arms can be stolen.

706
00:42:28,096 --> 00:42:30,432
You need to find at least 8 arithmetic operations.

707
00:42:30,632 --> 00:42:36,204
You get them by pasting them onto your arms, but

708
00:42:36,271 --> 00:42:39,474
You must be careful because the other teams can steal them.

709
00:42:39,574 --> 00:42:41,676
Okay, we’ll stick these onto your arms.

710
00:42:54,723 --> 00:42:57,993
Where should we start searching? Where is it?

711
00:43:00,362 --> 00:43:04,232
Here... we roughly know the way around

712
00:43:05,267 --> 00:43:07,235
Since the stairs are like this...

713
00:43:07,235 --> 00:43:08,637
I think there might be one at the waiting room at top.

714
00:43:08,637 --> 00:43:11,740
-Right? –Yeah. The waiting room or the rehearsal room.

715
00:43:11,740 --> 00:43:14,242
-You go take a look with Sohee, I’ll go somewhere else to search.

716
00:43:14,242 --> 00:43:16,278
Oh! Here!

717
00:43:19,648 --> 00:43:20,849
Square root, square root!

718
00:43:28,156 --> 00:43:31,226
-We might need it. – Let’s just paste it first.

719
00:43:31,226 --> 00:43:35,430
We can use it on 4 to change it to 2.

720
00:43:35,430 --> 00:43:36,765
Don’t get it stolen.

721
00:44:39,394 --> 00:44:40,362
They’re in filming.

722
00:44:45,734 --> 00:44:48,036
-Oh hyung, hello! – How are you here?

723
00:44:48,036 --> 00:44:50,372
I’m currently filming.

724
00:44:50,372 --> 00:44:52,874
Have you seen the other members?

725
00:44:52,874 --> 00:44:54,376
Like Jae Suk or Jong Kook.

726
00:44:58,713 --> 00:45:00,081
He didn’t see them!

727
00:45:05,353 --> 00:45:06,855
There isn’t any here.

728
00:45:07,589 --> 00:45:09,658
-Did you go to the filming studio? –No.

729
00:45:09,658 --> 00:45:10,492
Let’s take a look.

730
00:45:11,793 --> 00:45:13,495
It might be on the audience seats.

731
00:45:27,308 --> 00:45:30,311
Where’s Hwi Jae? I’m in the middle of filming Running Man.

732
00:45:30,311 --> 00:45:32,380
-Oh, really? – Where’s Hwi Jae?

733
00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:33,581
Over there.

734
00:45:33,581 --> 00:45:35,650
Ah, hello, hello.

735
00:45:39,587 --> 00:45:41,189
Ah, oppa is looking for this

736
00:45:42,323 --> 00:45:43,458
I also know about it.

737
00:45:43,458 --> 00:45:46,361
Oh! Yoon Jung, tell me.

738
00:45:46,361 --> 00:45:47,729
Where is it?

739
00:45:47,729 --> 00:45:49,364
I actually saw a few of them.

740
00:45:49,364 --> 00:45:52,233
Where are they, just tell me.

741
00:45:52,233 --> 00:45:53,234
I saw a few.

742
00:45:54,469 --> 00:45:56,104
Don’t tell others...

743
00:45:56,104 --> 00:45:56,771
Really?

744
00:45:57,572 --> 00:46:00,275
But what will you do for me?

745
00:46:01,443 --> 00:46:04,679
If I find it, I will credit the happiness of victory to you.

746
00:46:04,679 --> 00:46:06,414
Can’t you sing a song for us?

747
00:46:06,514 --> 00:46:10,118
I can’t do it, I don’t know any songs.

748
00:47:03,872 --> 00:47:05,173
I need to go film the show.

749
00:47:15,950 --> 00:47:16,985
Jae Suk!

750
00:47:22,891 --> 00:47:24,425
Hyung, I’m filming right now.

751
00:47:24,425 --> 00:47:28,463
-You’re here for the hint? –Yes, hint.

752
00:47:28,463 --> 00:47:29,831
Hello.

753
00:47:32,333 --> 00:47:34,636
-You’re here for the hint? –Yes.

754
00:47:35,370 --> 00:47:38,006
-There is a large hint here. –Here?

755
00:47:38,006 --> 00:47:41,242
-He is filming Running Man right now. –Yes, I am filming Running Man.

756
00:47:41,242 --> 00:47:44,012
The hint is among us.

757
00:47:44,779 --> 00:47:49,317
So , the hint , we’ll tell you, but...

758
00:47:49,317 --> 00:47:52,420
You need to sing a song for us.

759
00:47:57,125 --> 00:47:58,726
No matter what, rules are rules.

760
00:47:58,726 --> 00:48:02,864
-If you get above 92 points we will give it to you. –But 92 points is...

761
00:48:04,065 --> 00:48:05,133
92 points...

762
00:48:05,834 --> 00:48:10,038
Everyone please cheer for Yoo Jae Suk, who would be singing a song.

763
00:48:10,738 --> 00:48:13,308
-Song, what song? –That song.

764
00:48:13,308 --> 00:48:16,377
-Which song? –Who failed Hong Kyung Min’s song again?

765
00:48:16,377 --> 00:48:19,647
-Shaky Friendship –Ok, Shaky Friendship

766
00:48:19,647 --> 00:48:21,216
Music, start!

767
00:48:21,216 --> 00:48:26,888
I’m not really familiar with the song, it’s been a while since I sang it.

768
00:48:28,523 --> 00:48:30,792
Above 92.

769
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:51,813
No, this shouldn’t be. Why do I keep liking my friend’s girl?

770
00:48:52,046 --> 00:48:55,216
Why, as I tell myself I can’t do this inside my heart

771
00:48:55,216 --> 00:48:59,287
Is this girl the only thing I can think of? –you’re doing well!

772
00:48:59,287 --> 00:49:03,024
Why am I so anxious about this call

773
00:49:03,024 --> 00:49:05,059
that I received from her without may friend’s knowledge?

774
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:11,532
I could just cooly refuse but why can’t I refuse this girl?

775
00:49:11,566 --> 00:49:12,834
You already made an error!

776
00:49:12,834 --> 00:49:19,607
I’m really going crazy. I don’t even know myself anymore

777
00:49:19,607 --> 00:49:28,683
To question the friendship of a long-time friend over a girl

778
00:49:28,683 --> 00:49:30,518
I’m so distressed

779
00:49:30,518 --> 00:49:37,992
I’m so sorry my friend, for a moment I deceived you

780
00:49:37,992 --> 00:49:44,632
Until now my friendship to you must still be lacking

781
00:49:44,632 --> 00:49:54,575
Understand my friend, our friendship for a moment

782
00:49:55,276 --> 00:50:02,583
It was just a test of someone who was jealous of our friendship

783
00:50:02,583 --> 00:50:06,120
Please think of it like that!

784
00:50:08,790 --> 00:50:10,892
92 points, 92 points.

785
00:50:14,095 --> 00:50:16,164
-Ah... 92... -88 points.

786
00:50:22,937 --> 00:50:24,973
Jong Kook oppa come up too, aren’t you a team?

787
00:50:39,454 --> 00:50:42,056
Give us the chance to get 92 again.

788
00:50:42,056 --> 00:50:45,994
-If Jong Kook can get above 92, we’ll give you the sign. -What?

789
00:50:45,994 --> 00:50:48,930
What song are you going to sing?

790
00:50:48,930 --> 00:50:52,934
- Something that you sing often, a classic. -Lovable.

791
00:50:52,934 --> 00:50:57,138
- The next song is "Lovable" - Alright.

792
00:50:57,805 --> 00:50:59,474
If it’s below 92, you have to retire!

793
00:51:01,476 --> 00:51:03,911
Alright, let’s have Lovable!

794
00:51:04,712 --> 00:51:07,482
- Music please! - This is a bit sudden.

795
00:51:08,549 --> 00:51:13,087
Oh You’re lovable from head to toe

796
00:51:13,988 --> 00:51:18,559
I feel proud with you as my woman

797
00:51:18,559 --> 00:51:23,965
Waiting is fun now and even the air is sweet

798
00:51:23,965 --> 00:51:26,134
I love you like this - Where is it?

799
00:51:27,935 --> 00:51:29,137
Thank you!

800
00:51:29,470 --> 00:51:30,772
Where is it, Yoon Jung?

801
00:51:32,273 --> 00:51:35,143
- Need 92 points, 92 points. - You’re really going to tell us right?

802
00:51:35,143 --> 00:51:36,644
Really?

803
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:43,684
Even if the world is hard, when I see you,

804
00:51:43,684 --> 00:51:48,122
I can feel the wind in my heart

805
00:51:48,122 --> 00:51:51,692
Is this life?

806
00:51:51,692 --> 00:51:54,362
Or is this happiness?

807
00:51:54,362 --> 00:51:59,434
Whatever it is, I’m feeling it now

808
00:51:59,434 --> 00:52:03,871
From head to toe, you are... Lovable

809
00:52:03,871 --> 00:52:09,210
And my affection comes naturally

810
00:52:09,210 --> 00:52:14,449
Waiting is fun now and even the air is sweet

811
00:52:14,449 --> 00:52:18,753
I love you like this - How many points?

812
00:52:34,936 --> 00:52:36,003
Quickly please, quickly please.

813
00:52:56,891 --> 00:52:58,159
One Cut!

814
00:53:02,663 --> 00:53:03,865
- Quick give it to us! Quick! - But...

815
00:53:03,865 --> 00:53:06,834
Isn’t it very easy for someone who sings their won song to get 95 points?

816
00:53:06,834 --> 00:53:08,536
Fine, I’ll give it to you now.

817
00:53:12,473 --> 00:53:15,143
It was hidden to this degree.

818
00:53:15,143 --> 00:53:18,946
- I was nervous hiding it. - We don’t need a multiply sign.

819
00:53:19,914 --> 00:53:21,415
Oh, sorry about that.

820
00:53:21,415 --> 00:53:23,017
What are you going to do?

821
00:53:27,488 --> 00:53:29,824
- They got a multiply sign! - Where?

822
00:53:29,824 --> 00:53:31,959
- Jae Suk hyung got a multiply. - Really.

823
00:53:31,959 --> 00:53:35,963
- Just take it. - Excuse me but is it alright if we search at the back of the studio?

824
00:53:35,963 --> 00:53:38,032
- Yep, sure. - Just for a short while.

825
00:53:38,032 --> 00:53:43,538
If this gets aired, the audience will be really shocked.

826
00:53:43,538 --> 00:53:47,608
It’s fine, our program is let the viewers be relaxed in the morning, it’s alright.

827
00:53:47,608 --> 00:53:50,278
Really, to the beloved audience...

828
00:53:50,278 --> 00:53:54,782
- Really sorry, because of Running Man to suddenly appear... -Jae Suk hyung!

829
00:53:59,921 --> 00:54:02,523
- Go! Go! - I have to greet first!

830
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:11,660
Ok, ok, cut!

831
00:54:11,666 --> 00:54:14,435
- Thry found a minus. - Well done!

832
00:54:14,435 --> 00:54:18,573
Then... If... So suddenly...

833
00:54:18,573 --> 00:54:24,645
Everyone... Sunday morning... 2011...

834
00:54:44,732 --> 00:54:46,167
One cut!

835
00:54:46,734 --> 00:54:48,703
How did you find that

836
00:54:55,977 --> 00:54:57,912
Good job.

837
00:55:00,815 --> 00:55:02,550
Ending, ending.

838
00:55:02,550 --> 00:55:05,519
- Have a happy new year! - Thank you!

839
00:55:08,522 --> 00:55:10,891
- Then, we’ll leave now. - Thank you.

840
00:55:11,759 --> 00:55:13,261
You worked hard.

841
00:55:13,527 --> 00:55:15,229
Thank you. We’ll be going.

842
00:55:21,235 --> 00:55:23,671
Is it okay to tear it off?

843
00:55:25,606 --> 00:55:27,074
Ah, Director, hello.

844
00:55:47,862 --> 00:55:48,863
Thank you, director.

845
00:56:06,447 --> 00:56:07,648
Is there none here?

846
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:41,349
I really can’t find anything.

847
00:57:00,067 --> 00:57:01,035
Hyorin!

848
00:57:02,803 --> 00:57:03,637
Hyorin!

849
00:57:17,318 --> 00:57:19,620
Noona, come out for a while.

850
00:57:19,620 --> 00:57:21,655
Who are you to tell me to go there!

851
00:57:21,655 --> 00:57:23,958
- I can’t ask you to come? - What?

852
00:57:23,958 --> 00:57:25,626
- I can’t ask you to come? - Unnl!

853
00:57:25,626 --> 00:57:27,528
- You think you can order me? - Why?

854
00:57:28,229 --> 00:57:30,264
- I think she has a lot. - There’s nothing here.

855
00:57:30,264 --> 00:57:31,165
In her pocket.

856
00:57:32,633 --> 00:57:34,935
Hyung! Ji Hyo is hiding them in her pocket.

857
00:57:37,004 --> 00:57:39,240
Hyorin, just go,

858
00:57:50,484 --> 00:57:52,486
Wait!

859
00:57:52,486 --> 00:57:54,221
Quickly!

860
00:57:58,759 --> 00:57:59,960
Ji Hyo!

861
00:58:06,333 --> 00:58:07,568
It was mine.

862
00:58:07,568 --> 00:58:10,671
Hey this is...hold on.

863
00:58:14,141 --> 00:58:16,277
He ate it!

864
00:58:18,712 --> 00:58:20,247
Don’t swallow it!

865
00:59:00,554 --> 00:59:03,858
- The brackets are useful. - Exactly. The brackets are really useful!

866
00:59:04,325 --> 00:59:05,726
It’s really important.

867
00:59:07,962 --> 00:59:09,964
Brackets are really useful.

868
00:59:13,033 --> 00:59:13,968
Sohee...

869
00:59:16,570 --> 00:59:17,738
Sohee...

870
00:59:21,976 --> 00:59:23,978
Sohee, how did you see that one?

871
00:59:37,892 --> 00:59:39,426
- Kook Jong! - What?

872
00:59:39,693 --> 00:59:41,996
I’m actually not good at finding these things.

873
00:59:42,263 --> 00:59:43,531
But today...

874
00:59:43,531 --> 00:59:45,533
I seem to be doing well!

875
00:59:49,770 --> 00:59:51,505
It’s really big.

876
01:00:09,156 --> 01:00:10,491
Jae Suk oppa.

877
01:00:10,491 --> 01:00:11,926
Found it!

878
01:00:14,228 --> 01:00:15,229
Good job.

879
01:00:17,264 --> 01:00:21,635
- Sohee, where did you find that? - Here.

880
01:00:26,974 --> 01:00:28,142
Hello sir.

881
01:00:28,142 --> 01:00:29,476
Hello.

882
01:00:29,710 --> 01:00:31,111
Can we look around?

883
01:00:31,145 --> 01:00:32,947
- Come on in. - Thank you!

884
01:00:35,349 --> 01:00:37,384
This is where they keeo their set equipments,

885
01:00:57,371 --> 01:00:58,639
Jae Suk oppa.

886
01:00:58,639 --> 01:01:01,375
- Sohee, you found one? - Yes.

887
01:01:01,375 --> 01:01:02,276
Where?

888
01:01:02,276 --> 01:01:03,444
Over there.

889
01:01:03,444 --> 01:01:06,847
How do you find it so quietly?

890
01:01:06,847 --> 01:01:08,515
Really?

891
01:01:08,515 --> 01:01:13,020
- How many do you have? - Two.

892
01:01:13,020 --> 01:01:15,022
- Hyung, you? - One.

893
01:01:15,022 --> 01:01:16,023
I have four.

894
01:01:43,584 --> 01:01:46,120
You’ve worked hard! Hello!

895
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:50,090
Hyungnim, perhaps have you seen any maths signs around?

896
01:01:50,090 --> 01:01:51,692
Like this...

897
01:01:51,859 --> 01:01:59,633
There was something behind the stage. A minus sign, but someone took that.

898
01:01:59,633 --> 01:02:01,835
Ah really! We need a subtraction sign.

899
01:02:04,104 --> 01:02:08,108
Everybody! This is the easy brothers!

900
01:02:11,378 --> 01:02:15,916
Not only here in Korea but they are all over the world!

901
01:02:15,916 --> 01:02:18,952
The one and only easy brothers!

902
01:02:18,952 --> 01:02:21,789
Feel, touch, cross!

903
01:02:23,824 --> 01:02:25,759
Thank you!

904
01:02:29,163 --> 01:02:30,164
Can’t find any?

905
01:02:30,164 --> 01:02:33,333
Did you know that Jong Kook hyung has taken all of them?

906
01:02:34,234 --> 01:02:35,836
Let’s team up to snatch Jong Kook hyung’s!

907
01:02:35,836 --> 01:02:38,872
Where is Jong Kook hyung?

908
01:02:38,872 --> 01:02:40,407
Don’t know. Let’s look around.

909
01:02:42,376 --> 01:02:46,847
- Hyung, I will go up. - Jong Kook oppa is too scary!

910
01:02:48,515 --> 01:02:53,353
Si Won, they took all of it after the singing.

911
01:02:56,690 --> 01:03:00,027
What are you doing here?

912
01:03:00,761 --> 01:03:05,065
It is not a bad idea that we form an alliance with each other.

913
01:03:05,065 --> 01:03:08,635
To be honest, we do not know how to use the square root sign.

914
01:03:14,675 --> 01:03:16,577
Are you looking for a chance?

915
01:03:18,579 --> 01:03:22,015
You aren’t looking for a chance to do something to us right?

916
01:03:22,015 --> 01:03:24,118
How could I...

917
01:03:24,418 --> 01:03:25,419
Hyung!

918
01:03:25,419 --> 01:03:27,387
What do you need now?

919
01:03:28,222 --> 01:03:29,690
Give me an plus sign.

920
01:03:29,690 --> 01:03:30,724
We don’t have an plus sign.

921
01:03:33,026 --> 01:03:34,728
We’re leaving first then!

922
01:03:37,464 --> 01:03:38,732
Sohee, what’s that?

923
01:03:40,868 --> 01:03:41,869
Sohee, what’s that?

924
01:03:42,302 --> 01:03:43,337
I don’t have anything.

925
01:03:43,337 --> 01:03:45,439
- Don’t you have one right here? - I don’t!

926
01:03:45,439 --> 01:03:46,573
It’s just below here.

927
01:03:47,207 --> 01:03:50,010
Hyung, What are you doing? We don’t need brackets!

928
01:03:50,010 --> 01:03:52,780
Swap with us for a plus sign then!

929
01:03:52,780 --> 01:03:55,215
- I got it, give me the bracket. - Together, together.

930
01:03:56,984 --> 01:03:59,119
One, tow, three!

931
01:04:03,357 --> 01:04:05,993
Shy did you snatch it away!

932
01:04:24,044 --> 01:04:27,447
You con artist!

933
01:04:29,216 --> 01:04:31,752
Live your whole life like that!

934
01:04:36,123 --> 01:04:39,393
Hey, these kids seriously!

935
01:04:39,393 --> 01:04:41,929
What are you doing? Let us go out!

936
01:04:50,270 --> 01:04:52,539
Sorry!

937
01:04:58,645 --> 01:05:00,113
Why can’t we even snatch one!

938
01:05:00,914 --> 01:05:02,482
Let’s go somewhere else.

939
01:05:04,685 --> 01:05:06,420
Suk Jin hyung snatched mine away.

940
01:05:09,857 --> 01:05:12,092
Ah, Jong Kook hyung really has a lot!

941
01:05:14,928 --> 01:05:17,364
No, there isn’t.

942
01:05:17,364 --> 01:05:22,536
Really! You can find them yourself!

943
01:05:26,573 --> 01:05:29,042
Hey!

944
01:05:53,533 --> 01:05:56,036
Our team does not even have a single person!

945
01:05:56,036 --> 01:05:57,905
What are you doing?

946
01:05:57,905 --> 01:06:00,941
Why are you suddenly like this after being so quiet?

947
01:06:00,941 --> 01:06:01,942
That’s ours!

948
01:06:02,109 --> 01:06:03,977
Wow, this is awesome!

949
01:06:10,417 --> 01:06:13,287
You guys... Really!

950
01:06:13,453 --> 01:06:17,524
You all are too much! Treating me like this...

951
01:06:19,893 --> 01:06:21,228
What are you doing?!

952
01:06:21,228 --> 01:06:22,930
Where is the rest of my team?!

953
01:07:32,766 --> 01:07:34,067
Have you calculated it?

954
01:07:35,869 --> 01:07:41,041
Nah, let’s just use 2 plus signs and 3 minus signs.

955
01:07:41,040 --> 01:07:44,352
Dong Hoon, let’s not show the image of us trying to calculate.

956
01:07:45,296 --> 01:07:49,680
You are my...

957
01:08:00,394 --> 01:08:04,431
When we do not know how to calculate, who will comfort us?

958
01:08:05,984 --> 01:08:07,360
Calculus.

959
01:08:09,736 --> 01:08:12,372
What is this!

960
01:08:14,574 --> 01:08:16,710
When you are lonely.

961
01:08:17,444 --> 01:08:19,846
When you are lonely you have calculus!

962
01:08:22,315 --> 01:08:23,650
Unnl, I was there.

963
01:08:23,650 --> 01:08:26,119
What did you find?

964
01:08:26,119 --> 01:08:29,389
I found this division sign.

965
01:08:30,724 --> 01:08:32,359
What’s more important is that I found this minus sign.

966
01:08:32,359 --> 01:08:34,161
We have three minus signs!

967
01:08:36,563 --> 01:08:39,366
- There is 10. - Now we can move out!

968
01:08:39,366 --> 01:08:41,768
- Both of us will protect noona. - Okay!

969
01:08:43,336 --> 01:08:45,639
See, they are really fast!

970
01:08:45,639 --> 01:08:50,510
They really wiped out this whole area.

971
01:08:53,947 --> 01:08:56,083
Sohee, where are you going?

972
01:08:57,651 --> 01:08:59,653
Sohee, where are you going?

973
01:09:01,555 --> 01:09:02,756
Where are you going?

974
01:09:06,426 --> 01:09:07,961
Sohee, where are you going?

975
01:09:09,162 --> 01:09:10,697
Sohee, where are you going?

976
01:09:11,098 --> 01:09:14,101
You are going to steel from them? Sohee!

977
01:09:15,068 --> 01:09:16,903
Why did you run out?

978
01:09:26,413 --> 01:09:27,614
Jong Kook opp!

979
01:09:28,315 --> 01:09:30,617
Sohee, this is great!

980
01:09:33,353 --> 01:09:34,421
Many division signs?

981
01:09:34,955 --> 01:09:36,123
- Huh? - Many division signs?

982
01:09:36,123 --> 01:09:38,625
No division signs.

983
01:09:39,993 --> 01:09:42,062
Isn’t that one!!

984
01:09:42,462 --> 01:09:43,697
Jong Kook hyung isn’t here?

985
01:09:43,697 --> 01:09:44,397
Huh?

986
01:09:44,664 --> 01:09:46,099
We have 3 while you have 2...

987
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:48,468
- Jong Kook is right here... - Where?

988
01:09:53,673 --> 01:09:56,510
Why did your expression change?

989
01:09:56,510 --> 01:09:58,578
Hey, move a bit!

990
01:09:59,279 --> 01:10:02,315
Ah, what kind of camouflage do you have, hyung!

991
01:10:15,495 --> 01:10:18,598
- Why did Suk Jin hyung take mine away just now. - Why?

992
01:10:18,598 --> 01:10:20,167
Didn’t he tear way those on my arms?

993
01:10:29,342 --> 01:10:31,578
Hey, hey! Sohee found one! Sohee found one!

994
01:10:42,689 --> 01:10:44,024
- Sohee found another one! - Really...

995
01:10:44,024 --> 01:10:45,458
Hey, Sohee!

996
01:10:50,063 --> 01:10:53,266
Go away!!

997
01:11:02,776 --> 01:11:04,411
How are you so able to find so much?

998
01:11:04,411 --> 01:11:08,915
- How did you find it? You are really great! - Where did you find it from?

999
01:11:09,449 --> 01:11:12,252
You really can find these things!

1000
01:11:12,719 --> 01:11:15,222
- Ok, let’s verify if you’ve really got 8 pieces. - Let’s verify the number of pieces.

1001
01:11:15,222 --> 01:11:19,926
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8.

1002
01:11:19,926 --> 01:11:25,265
Ok 8, you’ve passed. Now go to Paris Park.

1003
01:11:25,265 --> 01:11:26,266
Paris Park?

1004
01:11:26,900 --> 01:11:28,668
- Mok Dong! - Really?

1005
01:11:34,307 --> 01:11:39,179
First we use brackets, then we use this.

1006
01:11:41,014 --> 01:11:46,720
The we use the brackets around these, from 8 to 1, and then over here...

1007
01:11:49,656 --> 01:11:53,326
I said we must use brackets, but I don’t really know how to use the brackets.

1008
01:11:54,361 --> 01:11:57,197
Maybe we should have found 20 math symbols!

1009
01:12:04,738 --> 01:12:08,008
It’s okay, hyung, you just do it.

1010
01:12:10,744 --> 01:12:13,613
If it’s good you will be saved.

1011
01:12:18,118 --> 01:12:23,857
We must let Sohee smile once before she leaves.

1012
01:12:25,592 --> 01:12:27,360
Is it possible?

1013
01:12:27,360 --> 01:12:28,962
Not possible!

1014
01:12:53,119 --> 01:12:57,190
- Do you see your own team’s colour boards? - Yes.

1015
01:12:57,324 --> 01:12:58,825
Now do the sums on your own team’s board and get number 1.

1016
01:13:20,914 --> 01:13:22,816
You have too many minus signs.

1017
01:13:22,816 --> 01:13:26,019
Please do the sums on your own board and get 1 as fast as possible.

1018
01:13:45,872 --> 01:13:48,041
16, 4, 4...

1019
01:13:48,041 --> 01:13:50,477
Hyung, first, 8 plus 9 plus 7 will be 24 right?

1020
01:13:52,946 --> 01:13:55,014
Ah! It’s too complicated!

1021
01:13:56,516 --> 01:13:59,419
Why do you all have so many symbols?

1022
01:13:59,419 --> 01:14:04,357
Even if we didn’t find so many, as long as we do it right, we can also get 1.

1023
01:14:06,493 --> 01:14:09,896
If you minus 1 it will become 0.

1024
01:14:11,398 --> 01:14:12,799
Let’s use this, and add 1.

1025
01:14:13,700 --> 01:14:16,403
- Yes, yes. - Look, I’ll do this, and you calculate it again.

1026
01:14:16,403 --> 01:14:18,772
Look. 1, bracket 1.

1027
01:14:18,772 --> 01:14:20,874
That’s right, bracket 1.

1028
01:14:20,874 --> 01:14:22,041
Challenge!

1029
01:14:31,084 --> 01:14:34,053
If you pass, the lights will light up.

1030
01:14:42,195 --> 01:14:44,097
- Fail. - Why?

1031
01:14:45,198 --> 01:14:48,468
The answer you all have provided is -1.

1032
01:14:48,468 --> 01:14:49,569
Mlnus?

1033
01:15:06,486 --> 01:15:10,056
Just now we only used the numbers, then we use the brackets, right?

1034
01:15:13,193 --> 01:15:15,495
Divide.

1035
01:15:15,495 --> 01:15:16,429
That’s rights.

1036
01:15:17,597 --> 01:15:19,065
We’ve reached.

1037
01:15:28,975 --> 01:15:30,009
They’ve all reached?

1038
01:15:31,945 --> 01:15:33,980
We’ve come, we’ve come, we’ve come!

1039
01:15:33,980 --> 01:15:35,982
Let’s do it, let’s do it!

1040
01:15:37,450 --> 01:15:41,221
Oh? Quickly quickly! Dong Hoon, quickly! We can do it! There’s still time!

1041
01:15:41,221 --> 01:15:42,489
I’m doing it, I’m doing it!

1042
01:15:42,489 --> 01:15:45,925
- Just give us another minus sign. - We want a plus sign now.

1043
01:15:45,925 --> 01:15:47,794
We don’t have plus sign now.

1044
01:15:50,396 --> 01:15:54,467
Pass it to me. Minus, Minus...

1045
01:15:55,268 --> 01:15:57,637
No, no... It’s minus...

1046
01:15:57,637 --> 01:15:59,973
7 minus 2... Minus...

1047
01:16:00,440 --> 01:16:02,008
Minus?

1048
01:16:02,609 --> 01:16:03,476
There’s no minus?

1049
01:16:03,476 --> 01:16:06,012
- How can there be no minus? We had a minus! - Where’s the minus?

1050
01:16:06,012 --> 01:16:09,349
- Oh! It’s here! It scared me! - It almost spoiled everything.

1051
01:16:09,349 --> 01:16:13,786
- 3, 3... This must be first...3... - Then you add this, and add this...

1052
01:16:22,962 --> 01:16:23,963
What?

1053
01:16:24,797 --> 01:16:26,966
7 minus 2, minus...

1054
01:16:49,155 --> 01:16:49,856
What?

1055
01:16:50,790 --> 01:16:52,859
7 minus 2, minus...

1056
01:16:54,727 --> 01:16:57,764
7 minus 2, add here...

1057
01:16:57,764 --> 01:16:59,566
Add 2 and 4...

1058
01:17:01,467 --> 01:17:06,673
It’s done!

1059
01:17:13,046 --> 01:17:16,049
Wow, theirs is really simple. Really simple!

1060
01:17:20,219 --> 01:17:22,822
1, 2, 3, completed!

1061
01:17:43,743 --> 01:17:47,080
I said we aren’t the last! We aren’t the last!

1062
01:17:51,117 --> 01:17:53,386
What to do? That’s why I said...

1063
01:17:53,386 --> 01:17:55,888
I said we could be the first!

1064
01:17:55,888 --> 01:17:59,092
Actually blue team could have gotten 1.

1065
01:17:59,092 --> 01:18:00,026
Oh, really?

1066
01:18:10,169 --> 01:18:14,774
- If you move the brackets in front of the minus sign you would have won. - You see!! I was right!!

1067
01:18:14,774 --> 01:18:18,745
Ahhhhhh!!

1068
01:18:18,745 --> 01:18:21,080
What are you doing leading 2 children?

1069
01:18:24,083 --> 01:18:26,586
It’s the end? It’s now totally over?

1070
01:18:27,687 --> 01:18:30,957
Yellow team has won, everybody please gather in front.

1071
01:18:32,291 --> 01:18:34,761
We are unintelligent, so we won.

1072
01:18:34,761 --> 01:18:38,197
Calculus! Equations! We don’t need all of them!

1073
01:18:38,998 --> 01:18:43,870
Our mathematics just consist of plus and minus!

1074
01:18:43,870 --> 01:18:48,908
You want us to use square root? No! We just use plus and minus!

1075
01:18:49,676 --> 01:18:58,217
Today’s best Hallyu Star team is the last to arrive, yet using just simple plus and minus,

1076
01:18:58,217 --> 01:19:00,486
Calculus and equations are all not needed.

1077
01:19:00,486 --> 01:19:02,321
Sulli’s Team!

1078
01:19:08,094 --> 01:19:12,598
Happy Year 2012!

1079
01:19:26,245 --> 01:19:27,513
Who are they?

1080
01:19:33,686 --> 01:19:35,388
What mission must we do?

1081
01:19:35,388 --> 01:19:37,857
Please eliminate all the Running Man members.

1082
01:19:41,828 --> 01:19:44,097
Who is this betrayer? Does he or does she not exist?

1083
01:19:44,097 --> 01:19:45,164
Oh no, this...

1084
01:19:47,767 --> 01:19:49,602
It’s not possible yo have a reversal. It’s obvious there will be no reversal.

1085
01:19:49,602 --> 01:19:50,937
I almost died!

1086
01:19:50,937 --> 01:19:52,472
Faster, faster!

1087
01:19:52,472 --> 01:19:53,940
Other mission?

1088
01:19:54,448 --> 01:19:57,470
Before recording a special episode, you should eat something before coming.
