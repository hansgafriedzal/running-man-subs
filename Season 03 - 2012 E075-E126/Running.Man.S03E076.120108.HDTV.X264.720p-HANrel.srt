00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:08,113
You're bleeding!

00:01:08,113 --> 00:01:09,036

3
00:01:09,036 --> 00:01:11,936
I will absolutely not let this pass.

4
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:13,636
They want to kill us.

5
00:01:33,169 --> 00:01:35,369
Oppa Is annoying.

6
00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:37,269
Who does she think she's talking to?

7
00:01:37,269 --> 00:01:39,436
Really?

8
00:01:53,103 --> 00:01:56,236
Oh, hello.

00:02:03,436 --> 00:02:06,003

13
00:02:14,903 --> 00:02:17,003
Are you alone?

00:02:17,003 --> 00:02:19,703
Yes, as for now it seems like this.

15
00:02:31,269 --> 00:02:34,436
By the way, how old are you?

16
00:02:34,769 --> 00:02:36,936

00:02:38,803 --> 00:02:40,769
So you are hyung.

00:02:58,802 --> 00:03:01,269
I am proposing to Miss Han Ye Jin now.

20
00:03:01,702 --> 00:03:04,969
I will solve this, don't worry.

21
00:03:05,736 --> 00:03:07,136
Hyungnim!

22
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:09,336
Oh, hyung. What are you doing here?

23
00:03:10,002 --> 00:03:11,936
I didn't even see you guys because you’re in black.

24
00:03:11,936 --> 00:03:13,502
Hello.

25
00:03:28,936 --> 00:03:30,802

26
00:03:31,236 --> 00:03:33,036

00:03:38,502 --> 00:03:40,836
Follow here, please follow me.

31
00:03:41,936 --> 00:03:43,936
What do you mean by this?

32
00:03:43,936 --> 00:03:46,136
"Follow here" and "Please follow me" what's that?

33
00:04:23,136 --> 00:04:24,636
Who's that?

34
00:04:25,302 --> 00:04:28,869
Oh, hyung!

35
00:04:29,202 --> 00:04:30,602
Hyungnim, you've come.

36
00:04:30,602 --> 00:04:32,002
Yes. I've come.

37
00:05:01,069 --> 00:05:03,436
What sort of weapon is placed inside here?

38
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:21,502
Bell Hide and Seek.

39
00:05:21,569 --> 00:05:23,569
Please eliminate all the Running Men.

40
00:05:23,569 --> 00:05:27,102
We will give you 2 chances to recruit spies.

41
00:05:27,102 --> 00:05:28,869
Chance to recruit...

42
00:05:29,002 --> 00:05:31,202
What did you just say?

43
00:05:31,836 --> 00:05:34,636
We will give you 2 chances to recruit spies.

44
00:05:34,736 --> 00:05:37,336
Before the Running Man members complete their mission

45
00:05:37,402 --> 00:05:40,236
Eliminate all of them for your mission to succeed!

46
00:05:48,236 --> 00:05:51,169
What, what does this mean?

47
00:05:51,169 --> 00:05:53,169
What on earth does this mean?

48
00:05:53,169 --> 00:05:55,569
There were never such things in the past.

49
00:05:57,769 --> 00:05:59,336
We will give you 2 chances to recruit spies.

50
00:05:59,402 --> 00:06:02,636
So this means we can recruit 2 spies?

51
00:06:03,569 --> 00:06:06,002
Eliminate everyone...

52
00:06:11,502 --> 00:06:14,969
What's the meaning, I don't understand a bit.

53
00:06:15,636 --> 00:06:18,769
To eliminate means to tear off the name tags, right?

54
00:06:18,769 --> 00:06:20,669
What is the method of elimination?

55
00:06:25,236 --> 00:06:27,502
Today's mission is,

56
00:06:27,502 --> 00:06:30,702
Running Men will foe moving around 3 areas in YeoSu.

57
00:06:30,869 --> 00:06:35,936
While moving about,they'll be give missions They'll think they doing the race aione.

58
00:06:35,969 --> 00:06:40,002
The Running Men totally do not know' of your existence,

59
00:06:40,002 --> 00:06:46,769
At the final location,tear off the Running Man members' tags to eliminate them, and yon will be victorious.

60
00:06:46,769 --> 00:06:54,236
if there is at least 1 person remaining to successfully complete the mission, then tiie victory belongs to tiie Running Men,

61
00:07:02,636 --> 00:07:04,936
There's only one person left.

62
00:07:05,302 --> 00:07:09,336
Do we succeed if we don’t tear off our spies' nametag?

63
00:07:09,336 --> 00:07:12,636
- Yes.

64
00:07:15,136 --> 00:07:20,102
So, this means... Jae Suk, HaHa. and Kim Joong Kook...

65
00:07:20,136 --> 00:07:23,836
The spy should be one good person and one slower person.

66
00:07:24,002 --> 00:07:25,802
One of them will be the spy?

67
00:07:28,702 --> 00:07:32,736
Can't you follow?

68
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:34,802
I am just thinking.

69
00:07:35,902 --> 00:07:38,136
What if...

70
00:07:38,136 --> 00:07:40,602
the spies are also in the Running Man team, right?

71
00:07:40,602 --> 00:07:42,502
Of course. Didn't I just say?

72
00:07:44,302 --> 00:07:47,636
-1 am listening.carefully.

73
00:07:47,636 --> 00:07:50,869
Us wearing black clothes, the four of us...

74
00:07:51,902 --> 00:07:57,669
It's better for us to split up into teams.

75
00:07:57,902 --> 00:08:01,269
Hyung, you should have eaten before coming for a recording.

76
00:08:04,969 --> 00:08:07,002
So let’s split into 2 persons per team, how's that?

77
00:08:07,002 --> 00:08:09,402
-I'm listening -2 persons a team, what do you think?

78
00:08:09,402 --> 00:08:11,036
Good idea.

79
00:08:12,302 --> 00:08:14,502
If we move together, it will he too obvious.

80
00:08:14,502 --> 00:08:17,569
So let's split according to our height.

81
00:08:17,569 --> 00:08:18,936
I am the shortest..

82
00:08:18,936 --> 00:08:20,369
No, no.

83
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:23,535
Tall team, and short team.

84
00:08:24,835 --> 00:08:26,302
It's so good to be tall..

85
00:08:28,369 --> 00:08:30,535
It’s all settled, so let's go.

86
00:08:32,934 --> 00:08:34,369
Let's do a cheer.

87
00:08:34,369 --> 00:08:35,602
Killers also do cheers?

88
00:08:35,602 --> 00:08:37,202
I don't know.

89
00:08:37,968 --> 00:08:40,702
1, 2, 3, Fighting!

90
00:08:42,968 --> 00:08:44,169
Not bringing the bag along?

91
00:08:44,635 --> 00:08:46,602
It will explode by itself in a while.

92
00:08:47,102 --> 00:08:51,002
After conveying the mission, it will automatically explode.

93
00:08:59,102 --> 00:09:02,735
Wah, this place is really beautiful! It's all beaches!

94
00:09:02,735 --> 00:09:06,202
I will now introduce, the first sightseeing location.

95
00:09:06,202 --> 00:09:08,635
-YeoSu Fisheries Market. -Yes.

96
00:09:08,969 --> 00:09:13,369
Now I will give all of you this. There will be information inside.

97
00:09:14,035 --> 00:09:16,802
YeoSu sightseeing information. It's here,

98
00:09:16,802 --> 00:09:18,535

99
00:09:18,535 --> 00:09:21,302
There's a place called YeoSu Fisheries Market.

100
00:09:21,302 --> 00:09:22,569
It's here!

101
00:09:22,569 --> 00:09:23,969
It came up!

102
00:09:23,969 --> 00:09:27,835
Below, there will be information about this market.

103
00:09:27,835 --> 00:09:29,269
Are we studying now?

104
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:31,169
Why are making us study a lot lately?

105
00:09:33,969 --> 00:09:36,035
Full shot. Best best!

106
00:09:55,769 --> 00:09:58,235
But is it a little coincidental today?

107
00:09:58,235 --> 00:10:00,302
There are 4 men.

108
00:10:00,302 --> 00:10:01,435
Yes.

109
00:10:04,502 --> 00:10:06,302
Shall we duke it out with Jong Kook?

110
00:10:07,969 --> 00:10:11,735
It's not like you're alone, us hyungs will be around too.

111
00:10:12,102 --> 00:10:13,669
Us hyungs mean what we say.

112
00:10:47,635 --> 00:10:49,235
This is the fish market.

113
00:10:49,635 --> 00:10:52,135
I’m getting jittery.

114
00:10:55,335 --> 00:10:56,535
Hold on.

115
00:10:56,635 --> 00:11:00,202
Isn't it too easy to be exposed in here?Youxan-see everything with ease.

116
00:11:00,302 --> 00:11:05,069
Plus our black suits are even more eye-catching.

117
00:11:07,735 --> 00:11:10,135
Aren't they movie actors?

118
00:11:13,769 --> 00:11:15,735
Shh, it's a secret.

119
00:11:17,369 --> 00:11:20,702
Are there good places here?

120
00:11:20,835 --> 00:11:23,469
How about here?

121
00:11:23,535 --> 00:11:26,302
Hey, how about that dry cleaning shop?

122
00:11:28,235 --> 00:11:29,169
It's not ba ?

123
00:11:37,102 --> 00:11:38,369
Hello

124
00:11:38,769 --> 00:11:39,469
Hello

125
00:11:39,735 --> 00:11:41,435
Do you know Running Man?

126
00:11:41,535 --> 00:11:43,802
- That show on tv... -Yeah,that's right.

127
00:11:43,935 --> 00:11:46,269
Something about chasing?

128
00:11:46,369 --> 00:11:48,669
- You do know.fight? - What are you here for?

129
00:11:48,835 --> 00:11:50,902
We're looking for a place to observe the area.

130
00:11:51,035 --> 00:11:55,135
That place with a window can help us.

131
00:11:55,802 --> 00:11:58,835
We'll observe from there for awhile.

132
00:12:11,502 --> 00:12:15,202
But there are no guests today?

133
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:16,202
There should be.

134
00:12:17,102 --> 00:12:19,535
But there will be an elimination here.

135
00:12:20,169 --> 00:12:23,769
When you react  there, complete your mission after alighting,

136
00:12:23,869 --> 00:12:25,669
but finish within the time limit.

137
00:12:25,735 --> 00:12:29,769
-It's like that. -There's no elimination?

138
00:12:29,802 --> 00:12:32,400
Completing the mission and boarding the bus within the time limit will be a success

139
00:12:32,424 --> 00:12:34,424
failing to board wifi lead to elimination.

140
00:12:36,902 --> 00:12:40,269
-Who will be eliminated? -Kwang Soo, Haha.

141
00:12:44,669 --> 00:12:46,835

Actually we don't know if they will take this path.

181
00:15:18,502 --> 00:15:20,035
Then we'll be waiting in vain.

182
00:15:20,168 --> 00:15:23,468
After 2 or 3 hours they'll all be going home and we'll still be waiting.

183
00:15:23,602 --> 00:15:25,735
Ah, it couldn't be.

184
00:15:25,868 --> 00:15:27,902
That will be a real betrayal.

185
00:15:31,135 --> 00:15:32,568
Have you seen it on the web?

186
00:15:32,602 --> 00:15:36,402
The toughest.jdb is the policeman during a game.

187
00:15:36,402 --> 00:15:37,635
Oh. that's right.

188
00:15:37,735 --> 00:15:42,668
They have their backs to the game while listening to cheers.

189
00:15:42,768 --> 00:15:46,068
I can't do that. I'll be too curious to do that.

190
00:15:53,568 --> 00:15:57,135
Can we eat this mandarin orange?

191
00:15:57,235 --> 00:15:59,302
I didn't prepare anything.

192
00:16:00,202 --> 00:16:03,935
If you want to eat go ahead, but don't eat too many.

193
00:16:06,468 --> 00:16:08,935
I felt like eating the orange when I saw it.

194
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:12,068
I'll start eating. Just one.

195
00:16:16,868 --> 00:16:18,302
Delicious, delicious!

196
00:16:24,602 --> 00:16:29,935
Aunt Son Chun Ja.

197
00:16:30,235 --> 00:16:34,635
Aunt Chun Ja.

198
00:16:34,968 --> 00:16:37,435
The one selling mustard leaf kimchi, Aunt Chun Ja!

199
00:16:38,335 --> 00:16:39,802
Have you found yours?

200
00:16:39,968 --> 00:16:41,102
Aunt Chun Ja!

201
00:16:41,168 --> 00:16:43,502
Where do they sell clam skewers?

202
00:16:43,968 --> 00:16:45,602
Oh. behind?

203
00:16:47,068 --> 00:16:50,868
Aunt Park Bong Jin!

204
00:16:54,502 --> 00:16:56,868
Aunt Park Bong Jin!

205
00:16:57,902 --> 00:17:01,035
Hello, are you Aunt Park Bong Jin?

206
00:17:01,868 --> 00:17:03,002

00:17:10,468 --> 00:17:13,468
I found Aunt Park Bong Jin.

210
00:17:15,767 --> 00:17:19,102
Please give me some Clam skewers.

211
00:17:19,334 --> 00:17:22,735
-How much is it? - It should be 18000 but I’ll sell it at 16000.

212
00:17:22,834 --> 00:17:25,302
- No no. I'll buy for 18000. -16000 is enough

213
00:17:25,468 --> 00:17:27,602
-No, no. 18000. -No need to measure.

214
00:17:27,901 --> 00:17:31,668
I found her. I'm thankful that she raised her hand.

215
00:17:32,868 --> 00:17:34,568

Where is Park Hwa Ja ?

220
00:17:55,002 --> 00:17:56,302

221
00:17:56,968 --> 00:17:58,835

You're here. Aunt.

225
00:18:08,035 --> 00:18:09,868

00:18:10,668 --> 00:18:14,302

00:18:30,835 --> 00:18:31,935
Jeez, hyung.

233
00:18:31,935 --> 00:18:34,102
You haven't found her yet?

234
00:18:34,302 --> 00:18:38,302
Aunt, you must take care of your health.

235
00:18:38,868 --> 00:18:40,935
Here's wishing you a happy new year.

236
00:18:41,068 --> 00:18:43,768
May your business prosper.

237
00:18:43,835 --> 00:18:46,768
I'm going off. Good job everyone!

238
00:18:54,268 --> 00:18:57,135
-Aunt Jang Yong Ja. -I'll check it.

239
00:18:57,235 --> 00:19:01,802
Aunt Jang Yong Ja. octopus, correct!

240
00:19:02,335 --> 00:19:03,668
Please get on.

241
00:19:09,102 --> 00:19:12,635
Haha, aunt Park Bong Jin.

242
00:19:13,168 --> 00:19:15,402
Aunt Chun Ja. Is Aunt Chun Ja here?

243
00:19:16,768 --> 00:19:18,368
Aunt Shin Geum Ja!

244
00:19:20,902 --> 00:19:22,602
Aunt Chun Ja!

245
00:19:23,568 --> 00:19:25,502
-Aunt Chun Ja? - I'm not.

246
00:19:30,568 --> 00:19:33,201
Gary, Gary.

247
00:19:35,468 --> 00:19:37,301
Aunt, Aunt Chun Ja.

248
00:19:37,335 --> 00:19:39,801
I got it, I know the mission.

249
00:19:39,935 --> 00:19:42,835
He's looking for some mustard leaf kimchi Master.

250
00:19:42,968 --> 00:19:44,935
Ah, some aunt, some aunt.

251
00:19:46,068 --> 00:19:48,501
Aunt! Mustard leaf kimchi!

252
00:19:48,568 --> 00:19:50,068
It's mustard leaf kimchi.

253
00:19:52,135 --> 00:19:53,635
Aunt Shin Geum Ja!

254
00:19:54,168 --> 00:19:56,135
I have something to tell you.

255
00:19:56,468 --> 00:19:57,868
Over there.

256
00:20:02,335 --> 00:20:03,501
Aunt Chun Ja!

257
00:20:09,535 --> 00:20:13,168
-We can't just. -stay here. Let's go.

258
00:20:13,401 --> 00:20:17,535
Uncle, thanks a lot. Happy New Year.

259
00:20:17,735 --> 00:20:19,801
Ah, where is it?

260
00:20:24,768 --> 00:20:26,368
Aunt Shim Geum Ja!

261
00:20:33,201 --> 00:20:35,535
Aunt, hello. Are you Aunt Shim Geum Ja?

262
00:20:35,668 --> 00:20:40,901
Oh! Aunt, I finally found you.

263
00:20:41,068 --> 00:20:43,435
Please give me some salted fish.

264
00:20:43,501 --> 00:20:45,801
Are you Aunt Son Chun Ja? Ah, really?

265
00:20:45,835 --> 00:20:47,668
Please give me some mustard leaf kimchi.

266
00:20:47,801 --> 00:20:50,935
Aunt, where have you been.

267
00:20:52,235 --> 00:20:52,968
Quickly!

268
00:20:54,568 --> 00:20:57,535
You've been here all this while.

269
00:20:58,201 --> 00:21:00,935
I was going crazy looking for you.

270
00:21:04,368 --> 00:21:07,035
Please sign here.

271
00:21:32,735 --> 00:21:35,001
Hang on, Aunt Shim Geum Ja!

272
00:21:44,601 --> 00:21:45,435
Be quiet.

273
00:21:45,535 --> 00:21:49,168
Do you want to die or to be a Spy?

274
00:21:51,935 --> 00:21:55,668
- Quickly say it. die or Spy? -A Spy. a Spy.

275
00:21:57,901 --> 00:21:59,201
You are a Spy now.

276
00:22:09,401 --> 00:22:11,135
Hyung, when did you arrive?

277
00:22:11,235 --> 00:22:13,935
We came two days ago.

278
00:22:15,635 --> 00:22:18,601
Am I a Spy now? What do I do?

279
00:22:19,268 --> 00:22:26,601
Together with us. you eliminate the remaining members.

280
00:22:27,501 --> 00:22:28,501
I'm extremely good at this game.

281
00:22:28,501 --> 00:22:29,401
I got it.

282
00:22:30,968 --> 00:22:34,101
Hyung, I'll do well. No one will suspect me.

283
00:22:34,168 --> 00:22:34,635
Ok, I got it.

284
00:22:40,501 --> 00:22:41,401
Thank you so much.

285
00:22:41,468 --> 00:22:42,668
You don't have to be too grateful.

286
00:22:42,735 --> 00:22:44,301
I've always wanted to be a spy.

287
00:22:47,001 --> 00:22:49,668
It will be an important turning point when you watch the show.

288
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:50,401
That's right.

289
00:22:50,468 --> 00:22:54,035
If you tell the Running Man members, you are immediately out.

290
00:22:54,068 --> 00:22:54,668
Yes, out immediately.

291
00:22:54,768 --> 00:22:56,835
It will end our relationship too.

292
00:22:57,001 --> 00:22:59,235
- That's our relationship. - We'll sort our relationship like this.

293
00:22:59,335 --> 00:23:00,268
Jeez, hyung.

294
00:23:00,735 --> 00:23:02,401
Can he be a Spy?

295
00:23:02,601 --> 00:23:03,768
-I don't know. -He doesn't feel too reliable.

296
00:23:03,801 --> 00:23:06,868
We could just hold him and not let him go back in 30 minutes.

297
00:23:10,501 --> 00:23:12,001
Ok. go. Go.

298
00:23:12,068 --> 00:23:14,468
- I'll really do well. -Fighting, go!

299
00:23:14,501 --> 00:23:16,001
Fighting.

300
00:23:19,735 --> 00:23:21,135
It's done.

301
00:23:21,135 --> 00:23:25,935
Firstly, our goal has been achieved.

302
00:23:26,535 --> 00:23:27,635
Aunt!

303
00:23:28,368 --> 00:23:30,201
Yeosu is a city that brings luck!

304
00:23:33,235 --> 00:23:34,935
This is like a dream!

305
00:23:37,568 --> 00:23:40,501
Sung Soo, our mission has succeeded.

306
00:23:40,668 --> 00:23:43,168
We instigated Kwang Soo.

307
00:23:45,268 --> 00:23:47,668
Let’s rip them all here.

308
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:50,201
I have lots of confidence after catching Kwang Soo.

309
00:23:55,201 --> 00:23:56,868
- Is he eliminated?

310
00:23:57,101 --> 00:23:58,935
I passed right?

311
00:24:00,435 --> 00:24:01,201
You passed.

312
00:24:06,168 --> 00:24:08,535
Hey. why was it so hard?

313
00:24:08,568 --> 00:24:10,501
Oh, the jeotgal shop was too far in.

314
00:24:20,068 --> 00:24:21,768
Look, Kwang Soo sent this.

315
00:24:22,435 --> 00:24:25,335
Kwang Soo sent a heart, a heart.

316
00:24:27,435 --> 00:24:30,135
Hyung, it's a little weird.

317
00:24:30,335 --> 00:24:32,435
Isn't the mission too easy?

318
00:24:36,135 --> 00:24:41,068
Could there be something else? Someone has different mission?

319
00:24:47,668 --> 00:24:50,435
Recently you are so sensitive!

320
00:24:57,635 --> 00:25:00,168
- The music is not bad? -It is, right?

321
00:25:04,001 --> 00:25:06,234
We're going to the next destination.

322
00:25:10,934 --> 00:25:11,634
It's Odong Island.

323
00:25:24,934 --> 00:25:25,934
It's here.

324
00:25:33,301 --> 00:25:37,301
While we’re here, we need to decide where to lie in ambush.

325
00:25:37,501 --> 00:25:42,701
We need to decide which Running an member to target.

326
00:25:42,834 --> 00:25:47,368
Firstly, find the path that the unning Man will take.

327
00:25:50,534 --> 00:25:52,401
Hey, it's really awesome.

328
00:25:54,434 --> 00:26:02,201
We have to find a place to hide, then jump out and catch them.

329
00:26:02,968 --> 00:26:05,068
Behind the trees.

330
00:26:12,868 --> 00:26:15,934
Chun Hee. Everything can be seen, just come out.

331
00:26:16,234 --> 00:26:17,001
Why?

332
00:26:18,268 --> 00:26:21,334
It's hard to even get in.

333
00:26:24,801 --> 00:26:27,734
Hyung, we can just find a black tree.

334
00:26:29,434 --> 00:26:32,101
It's pretty dark in here.

335
00:26:34,601 --> 00:26:38,368
That's because we're wearing sunglasses.

336
00:26:46,334 --> 00:26:50,634
The second attraction is the famous Odong isiand

337
00:26:50,701 --> 00:26:52,701
Wow, the water is really clear!

338
00:26:52,734 --> 00:26:56,434
Hyung, look at the water!

339
00:26:56,468 --> 00:26:58,655
There's a time limit for this mission too.

340
00:26:58,655 --> 00:27:00,679
The second mission's time limit is 45 minutes.

341
00:27:01,234 --> 00:27:04,834
Alight the camelia train and find Running Men!

342
00:27:04,968 --> 00:27:08,434
-What?Running Man? -Aren't we Running Man?

343
00:27:10,201 --> 00:27:12,401
There are people giving the mission.

344
00:27:12,501 --> 00:27:15,801
Looks like it’s Dong Wan's first time introducing the mission.

345
00:27:15,834 --> 00:27:19,668
Dong Wan, is it like this or what?

346
00:27:19,901 --> 00:27:21,468
I don't think so.

347
00:27:25,368 --> 00:27:28,134
-But what is camellia car? -It's my first time here too.

348
00:27:28,301 --> 00:27:30,534
The camellia's are really beautiful, hyung.

349
00:27:30,534 --> 00:27:31,634
It's Miss Camellia.

350
00:27:31,634 --> 00:27:33,234
Wow, it's seriously awesome,

351
00:27:37,701 --> 00:27:43,001
see the sea and not the steps below.

352
00:27:43,568 --> 00:27:46,701
So over here, like this.

353
00:27:48,468 --> 00:27:49,334
Should we test it?

354
00:27:51,234 --> 00:27:53,968
Oh Chun Hee, what are you doing there?

355
00:27:54,534 --> 00:27:56,134
You can see me?

356
00:27:59,801 --> 00:28:01,601
But it's better here.

357
00:28:01,668 --> 00:28:06,101
Anyone approaching can be seen.

358
00:28:06,134 --> 00:28:10,134
We only have to hide ourselves properly.

359
00:28:12,768 --> 00:28:15,401
We have to climb the hill?

360
00:28:17,234 --> 00:28:19,834
Hello.

361
00:28:27,101 --> 00:28:31,368
Today we're running around and climbing hills.

362
00:28:37,334 --> 00:28:39,868
It's Running Man.

363
00:28:40,168 --> 00:28:42,668
Hey. one at a time! Ah, seriously...

364
00:28:47,201 --> 00:28:49,101
Wow, it's really nice here, the best.

365
00:28:49,134 --> 00:28:50,634
Hey, it's aivesome.

366
00:28:51,068 --> 00:28:52,434
What's this place?

367
00:28:55,401 --> 00:28:56,634
Odd or even?

368
00:29:04,468 --> 00:29:06,368
Even!

369
00:29:06,934 --> 00:29:11,534
-Odd! -Stand aside.

370
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:14,768
Ah, you have to be up ahead for this.

371
00:29:14,868 --> 00:29:16,601
Should I guess odd or even?

372
00:29:16,701 --> 00:29:18,068
Odd or even?

373
00:29:18,068 --> 00:29:20,334
Even, even!

374
00:29:27,634 --> 00:29:30,101
Even!

375
00:29:38,668 --> 00:29:39,501
Thanks.

376
00:29:40,468 --> 00:29:42,268
-Ah what is this? - Is it really the end?

377
00:29:42,301 --> 00:29:43,801
Only one can win at the mission.

378
00:29:43,901 --> 00:29:44,634
It's over?

379
00:29:45,834 --> 00:29:46,601
It s over?

380
00:29:46,668 --> 00:29:48,301
Hey, we have to go elsewhere.

381
00:29:48,734 --> 00:29:49,801
Go quickly, go quickly.

382
00:29:53,234 --> 00:29:56,468
Kwang Soo. really, thank you!

383
00:29:56,501 --> 00:29:59,001
Jong Kook, see you later!

384
00:29:59,834 --> 00:30:01,301
Kwang Soo!

385
00:30:01,301 --> 00:30:03,034
Seriously, thanks so much!

386
00:30:03,034 --> 00:30:04,568
I was about to say 'odd.'

387
00:30:06,758 --> 00:30:08,992
This is the best view.

388
00:30:09,325 --> 00:30:11,525
How can it be so nice?

389
00:30:16,025 --> 00:30:18,792
-How old are you? -21 years old.

390
00:30:19,325 --> 00:30:20,425
It's very cold, isn't it?

391
00:30:20,492 --> 00:30:22,392
Your hands are completely frozen.

392
00:30:22,758 --> 00:30:23,758
Seems like you have a girlfriend?

393
00:30:23,792 --> 00:30:25,625
-Ah, no, I don't. -You don't?

394
00:30:27,225 --> 00:30:29,492
Lets go to the Cave of Dragon.

395
00:30:29,625 --> 00:30:32,025
Shouldn't I get it right here?

396
00:30:32,058 --> 00:30:36,225
-Dong Hoon! -Ah, I'm sorry. Somehow I unconsciously...

397
00:30:36,258 --> 00:30:42,691
-Hello, little girl! - Hello! -Hi! - HaHa!

398
00:30:42,725 --> 00:30:46,691
Why won’t you greet me? Hello!

399
00:30:46,791 --> 00:30:52,691
-1. 2, 3! Ah, I took it, thank you! -Yes, thank you! Bye, see you again!

400
00:30:57,458 --> 00:31:01,825
Ah, seriously I...why is this so far away?!

401
00:31:05,525 --> 00:31:08,325
If I don't get it right here. I'm seriously going to lose my temper.

402
00:31:08,525 --> 00:31:10,558
Ah. seriously...

403
00:31:12,591 --> 00:31:14,558
Should I pick odd or even?

404
00:31:15,091 --> 00:31:17,158
-It's even! -Odd!

405
00:31:18,625 --> 00:31:20,425
Ah, I'm seriously going crazy!

406
00:31:23,858 --> 00:31:26,391
-Hyung. -I didn't play these games when I was little!

407
00:31:29,558 --> 00:31:31,658
Hyung. I'm sorry but I'm going to get it right.

408
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:35,191
Even!

409
00:31:38,758 --> 00:31:41,425
You thought you'd win before your hyung?

410
00:31:43,325 --> 00:31:45,425
Bungeobbang is so delicious.

411
00:31:45,425 --> 00:31:47,891
I haven’t eaten this in a while.

412
00:31:51,658 --> 00:31:52,925
Killers have to eat too.

413
00:31:53,925 --> 00:31:55,488
Killers may show a tough image

414
00:31:55,488 --> 00:31:57,512
but they eat bungeobbang and everything else, as well.

415
00:31:57,525 --> 00:31:58,391
Of course.

416
00:32:03,425 --> 00:32:06,191
Wow, seriously, there are too many places to hide over there.

417
00:32:07,691 --> 00:32:10,925
-It was a good idea that we went first. -Yeah, it was.

418
00:32:18,427 --> 00:32:21,927
-We have to run. We have to run. -This is so far away, really.

419
00:32:21,927 --> 00:32:24,094
Hang on, it should be somewhere over there.

420
00:32:26,694 --> 00:32:28,361
Sunrise Place!

421
00:32:36,827 --> 00:32:38,194
Oh, he's there!

422
00:32:39,594 --> 00:32:41,161
Found him!

423
00:32:57,161 --> 00:32:58,994
Found him!

424
00:33:04,861 --> 00:33:07,861
Found him! Ah, oppa!

425
00:33:13,661 --> 00:33:15,061
Who are you?!

426
00:33:19,627 --> 00:33:25,594
No one is coming, nobody's coming.

427
00:33:33,527 --> 00:33:35,927
-When did you two get here? -I told you JI Hyo would come here.

428
00:33:35,927 --> 00:33:39,894
-How long have you been here? - We've been over there since morning.

429
00:33:39,894 --> 00:33:41,094
Daebak!

430
00:33:41,094 --> 00:33:44,227
-Someone might come. -Nobody's coming, seriously no one is going to come.

431
00:33:44,294 --> 00:33:46,227
They all went off to do the mission.

432
00:33:46,627 --> 00:33:49,761
-They're really all somewhere else. They're all gone. -We can trust you, right?

433
00:33:49,761 --> 00:33:55,227
-If your name tag is ripped off, you're out, right? -Why are you taking it off?

434
00:33:55,561 --> 00:33:57,294
Do you want to be eliminated or...?

435
00:33:57,327 --> 00:33:59,294
Do you have it?

436
00:34:02,794 --> 00:34:04,794
Do you want to be a spy?

437
00:34:04,794 --> 00:34:07,627
What kind of choice is this?

438
00:34:08,627 --> 00:34:11,493
-What kind of choice is this? -Then do you just want to be out right from the beginning?

439
00:34:11,493 --> 00:34:16,161
-No. no, I understand. I'll be a spy. I'll be a spy. Hang on. -You'll have to be on our side.

440
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:17,893
No, I mean. oppa...

441
00:34:17,993 --> 00:34:21,694
-If someone is chosen as a spy. they should be happy. -No, no.

442
00:34:21,826 --> 00:34:24,594
-You’ve truly decided, right? -Yes, yes, ok. I'll do it.

443
00:34:24,594 --> 00:34:28,460
However, if you're found out by the other members, you're out right away.

444
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:31,094
-I got it. - You understand, right? - Yes.

445
00:34:33,127 --> 00:34:39,227
-How were you hiding here all of this time? -It was so cold, we have been waiting here since morning.

446
00:34:40,027 --> 00:34:42,661
-Do you know how scared I was? -You're on our side now.

447
00:34:42,661 --> 00:34:45,294
-I got it. -It's nice to see you.

448
00:34:47,261 --> 00:34:51,127
- We already chose Kwang Soo. -Ah, really?

449
00:34:51,127 --> 00:34:53,227
Why did you pick Kwang Soo?

450
00:34:55,993 --> 00:35:00,394
If Kwang Soo is the spy, no one is going to believe there's only one spy.

451
00:35:00,561 --> 00:35:05,127
They won't think he's the only one. They'll suspect others.

452
00:35:06,327 --> 00:35:09,561
It's entirely possible the fact that there are spies at all will be revealed.

453
00:35:13,627 --> 00:35:16,294
-Why did you choose Kwang Soo? - It’s not like we can change spies at this point.

454
00:35:16,294 --> 00:35:18,294
No, you can’t. He's by himself on the other side.

455
00:35:18,294 --> 00:35:20,794
I'm not running by myself.

456
00:35:20,861 --> 00:35:24,627
Two individuals are sitting on my shoulders.

457
00:35:27,127 --> 00:35:30,994
I must run. I must run.

458
00:35:31,494 --> 00:35:33,461
I'll be going, oppa. See you later.

459
00:35:33,927 --> 00:35:37,394
-Do not tell anyone our secret otherwise you'll be out immediately. -Ok, I understand.

460
00:35:37,494 --> 00:35:42,494
-Our side. -Our side, our side, yes. Goodbye!

461
00:35:43,061 --> 00:35:44,961
This turned out well.

462
00:35:47,927 --> 00:35:50,394
-Since Ji Hyo is really smart... -She is.

463
00:35:51,061 --> 00:35:55,194
Will I be a successful spy today? I'm in big trouble.

464
00:35:59,161 --> 00:36:03,027
If we take too much time, the oppas may start suspecting me. Let's hurry.

465
00:36:06,194 --> 00:36:07,660
Hello?

466
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,827
Who did you choose?

467
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:11,927
We chose Ji Hyo.

468
00:36:12,127 --> 00:36:14,027
Ah, Ji Hyo. ok.

469
00:36:14,694 --> 00:36:17,594
We pretended there were only two of us.

470
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:22,227
So you're saying you picked Ji Hyo, right? I see.

471
00:36:23,527 --> 00:36:28,094
Aw. you worked hard. We bought something delicious for you. so come quickly.

472
00:36:28,094 --> 00:36:31,560
-We're going to the city hall now. -Ok, see you there.

473
00:36:31,794 --> 00:36:33,827
They said they chose Ji Hyo.

474
00:36:34,427 --> 00:36:35,927
-It s Ji Ho, right?*-Ji Hyo.

475
00:36:35,927 --> 00:36:39,494
-Ah, Ji Hyo, Ji Hyo. -This will probably go on air.

476
00:36:40,394 --> 00:36:43,627
It's Ji Hyo. right? JI Hyo.

477
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:49,494
-I think we'll be able to win. -Yes, with Kwang Soo and Ji Hyo. Excellent.

478
00:36:54,327 --> 00:36:57,127
Good job in this cold weather.

479
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:22,294
We'll go around quickly, and watch from afar.

480
00:37:22,394 --> 00:37:26,460
One person will be the bait, you do it. You'll be the one to lure Jong Kook out.

481
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,360
I'm going to be the bait?

482
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:56,660
-Ok, so I'll get caught then. - Yeah.just get caught by him first.

483
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:04,260
Do you think Jong Kook hyung will give up then?

484
00:38:05,727 --> 00:38:10,227
-They won't even follow us, since they're not the chasers. -They're just gonna run away.

485
00:38:10,294 --> 00:38:12,460
-They don't know who we are. -They'll just avoid us.

486
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:14,694
Because they're afraid of the bell sound, they'll avoid it.

487
00:38:14,894 --> 00:38:18,527
-Then we should make as much noise as possible, right? -Then they'll just going to run away,

488
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:30,527
Hey, it's good you mentioned that now, otherwise we we'll be big trouble with your making that noise later.

489
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:35,460
-Do you want to do a test run of encountering Jong Kook? -No.

490
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:39,194
How about we try it out slowly with the three of us?

491
00:38:39,194 --> 00:38:41,260
-Ok, let's try it. -Three people will be needed.

492
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:50,227
I can't do it, it's too painful.

493
00:38:56,627 --> 00:38:59,460
1, 2, 3...Fighting!

494
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:30,594
-Can you tell us what's going on first? -What is this?

495
00:39:30,627 --> 00:39:32,460
-Please receive the walkie-talkies first. -Walkie talkies?

496
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:34,060
-What's going on? -Wow. it's been a while since we used those.

497
00:39:34,194 --> 00:39:36,760
-We're all one team? -There are definitely guests.

498
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:40,694
-Hey, I guess have to hide. -So we're going to be escaping and running around.

499
00:39:40,694 --> 00:39:43,460
It seems like forever since we last used these,

500
00:39:48,694 --> 00:39:55,427
Avoid the seekers wearing bells and find__________! Hints are located in the city hall's computers. The password is runningman

501
00:39:58,227 --> 00:40:02,694
-runningmanl is the password? -I'm not good with computers, so how am I supposed to find the hints?

502
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:05,327
We don't really have an IT guy here.

503
00:40:05,327 --> 00:40:06,827
There's me.

504
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:09,194
-Ah, Suk Jin hyung does know a little. -I'm good with IT.

505
00:40:11,094 --> 00:40:12,527
Who's the seeker?

506
00:40:15,427 --> 00:40:18,227
-It's been a longtime since we've all been on one team. - That's true.

507
00:40:39,994 --> 00:40:42,860
Hey, come here! This is set for password login!

508
00:40:44,727 --> 00:40:46,094
These all have password logins!

509
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:49,260
Don't you think we found this too quickly?

510
00:40:49,394 --> 00:40:50,927
Is that the case?

511
00:40:51,827 --> 00:40:54,527
What do I do? Do I click this here?

512
00:40:55,427 --> 00:40:56,794
Hyung, do I click this?

513
00:40:56,794 --> 00:40:58,860
-You have to press Enter. -Where do I press Enter?

514
00:40:59,827 --> 00:41:00,594
Oh, here?

515
00:41:03,394 --> 00:41:05,327
Ah, it says the password is incorrect.

516
00:41:12,794 --> 00:41:14,360
It says it's the incorrect password.

517
00:41:28,494 --> 00:41:29,760
Hyung, it's not this one!

518
00:41:42,693 --> 00:41:45,893
This is an important time, if we get caught here...

519
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:56,493
Hyung. it's not this one either!

520
00:41:56,493 --> 00:41:57,293
Not that one?

521
00:42:01,493 --> 00:42:02,527
It's not this either.

522
00:42:02,993 --> 00:42:06,227
Hyung, I think we came to the wrong place.

523
00:42:08,193 --> 00:42:12,260
From the beginning, I had a bad feeling about this place.

524
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:16,360
This place must not be it.

525
00:42:30,593 --> 00:42:32,160
The sound of bells...

526
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:34,127
It's nerve-wracking...

527
00:43:13,627 --> 00:43:15,493
These doors are all locked.

528
00:43:35,227 --> 00:43:36,693
They're here, they're here!

529
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:48,227
Oh, I hear it!

530
00:43:49,393 --> 00:43:50,327
Really?

531
00:44:01,860 --> 00:44:04,593
Hang on. hang on, hang on!

532
00:44:07,893 --> 00:44:11,827
This is daebak, daebak! Completely daebak!

533
00:44:20,127 --> 00:44:21,060
Hey!

534
00:44:23,393 --> 00:44:24,893
What are you doing?! Run away!

535
00:44:50,660 --> 00:44:53,060
-Come here. -These doors are all open.

536
00:44:53,327 --> 00:44:55,027
Hyung, this means we have to escape at all costs.

537
00:44:55,027 --> 00:44:57,327
It's been such a long time since we've done Bells Hide-And-Seek.

538
00:44:57,327 --> 00:45:03,027
-It really has been. -The guests might just stake out so their bells can't be heard.

539
00:45:03,027 --> 00:45:04,993
Think about what we did in the past.

540
00:45:05,793 --> 00:45:08,293
We never staked anyone out during the Hide-And-Seek.

541
00:45:08,293 --> 00:45:09,893
One person should stand guard. You do it.

542
00:45:09,893 --> 00:45:11,160
We just fully chased one other everywhere.

543
00:45:11,193 --> 00:45:12,060
You stand guard.

544
00:45:37,793 --> 00:45:39,160
Ah, it's the wrong password.

545
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:43,993
The right computers are somewhere...

546
00:45:53,827 --> 00:45:54,793
Hyung!

547
00:45:54,793 --> 00:45:55,293
What?

548
00:45:55,293 --> 00:45:57,193
-The sound of bells, the sound of bells, the sound of bells! -Where, where?

549
00:45:57,193 --> 00:45:58,693
I hear ringing coming this way!

550
00:45:59,860 --> 00:46:01,860
Hey, don't be frightened, don't be frightened!

551
00:46:04,627 --> 00:46:05,960
Do we go right away?

552
00:46:06,227 --> 00:46:07,927
We're going right away!

553
00:46:13,060 --> 00:46:14,427
Who are they?

554
00:46:28,293 --> 00:46:29,193
What is this?

555
00:46:29,193 --> 00:46:31,127
Chun Hee hyung is here, too?

556
00:46:31,493 --> 00:46:32,760
Who is it, who are they?!

557
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:34,260
Who is it, who is it?

558
00:46:46,527 --> 00:46:48,127
Who are you? It s Chun Hee!

559
00:46:53,593 --> 00:46:56,627
Oppa, go downstairs, downstairs!

560
00:46:57,160 --> 00:46:58,827
Hyung. how can you let them escape!

561
00:46:59,060 --> 00:47:00,293
Hurry, hurry!

562
00:47:01,527 --> 00:47:03,993
Oppa, where are you?

563
00:47:08,693 --> 00:47:10,827
Second floor, second floor!

564
00:47:10,827 --> 00:47:13,993
Who is it. who is it, who is it?

565
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:15,626
Sung Soo hyung!

566
00:47:39,126 --> 00:47:42,693
Let's hide. All the way at the end.

567
00:47:45,926 --> 00:47:47,293
Let's hide here.

568
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:57,060
Wow, they were chasing us to the end. While wearing pitch-black clothing.

569
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:04,626
Oppa, hurry and check outside!

570
00:48:04,626 --> 00:48:05,993
Me?

571
00:48:10,193 --> 00:48:12,593
We should check the computers at least.

572
00:48:12,593 --> 00:48:16,426
Check outside first so we can at least see if they're there or not.

573
00:48:46,660 --> 00:48:48,293
Hey, hey!

574
00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:02,126
Hey, Ji Hyo, no! Don't do it!

575
00:49:02,326 --> 00:49:04,226
Ji Hyo. no! Don't do it!

576
00:49:09,926 --> 00:49:11,693
Hang on. Chun Hee, hang on for a moment.

577
00:49:11,693 --> 00:49:14,493
Hey, Ji Hyo, what are you?

578
00:49:14,493 --> 00:49:16,093
Ji Hyo!

579
00:49:20,126 --> 00:49:22,793
Hey, whose side are you on? Are you a spy?

580
00:49:30,693 --> 00:49:32,160
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

581
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:33,526
No, no!

582
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:35,426
Why are you so strong?

583
00:49:36,393 --> 00:49:40,193
You Clumsy Chun Hee! I'm telling you to hurry and rip it off!

584
00:49:40,193 --> 00:49:43,060
Hey, what are you? Are you a spy?

585
00:49:43,126 --> 00:49:45,693
Hey, what is this? What are you doing right now?

586
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:51,393
Hey, what is this?

587
00:49:52,826 --> 00:49:55,460
You Clumsy Chun Hee!

588
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:08,126
SongJi Hyo! Seriously, you!

589
00:50:08,393 --> 00:50:09,626
Hey, you!

590
00:50:09,660 --> 00:50:10,926
Oppa, sorry, sorry.

591
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:11,826
You're a spy!

592
00:50:16,193 --> 00:50:19,326
Look! You died before Sung Soo oppa came. Isn't that good?

593
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:21,793
-Oppa. -You're a spy?

594
00:50:21,860 --> 00:50:23,260
I'm sorry!

595
00:50:43,826 --> 00:50:44,893
Comer over here.

596
00:51:01,526 --> 00:51:04,693
Ji Suk Jin. out! Ji Suk Jin, out!

597
00:51:08,826 --> 00:51:11,193
Ah, somehow I feel sorry for him.

598
00:51:13,126 --> 00:51:14,460
What are your missions?

599
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:19,993
Our mission is to key in the correct password in the computers in this floor.

600
00:51:20,593 --> 00:51:24,093
Then hide from those wearing the bells, look for something.

601
00:51:24,193 --> 00:51:25,793
By saying 'something1 you guys still don't know what that is, right?

602
00:51:26,493 --> 00:51:28,693
Ahh! Alright. I understand.

603
00:51:31,526 --> 00:51:33,026
Then let us finish them up!

604
00:51:46,693 --> 00:51:49,393
Noona! Why was Suk Jin hyung eliminated?

605
00:51:49,693 --> 00:51:51,693
Hey! You come here.

606
00:51:51,726 --> 00:51:52,426
Why?

607
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:53,260
Come over quickly!

608
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:54,693
-Why? -Come here!

609
00:51:55,860 --> 00:51:56,893
What?

610
00:51:57,960 --> 00:52:00,326
You...You're a spy, right?!

611
00:52:03,193 --> 00:52:04,626
We already caught Kwang Soo...

612
00:52:04,693 --> 00:52:07,960
Ah, really? Why Kwang Soo?

613
00:52:12,060 --> 00:52:13,360
You're a spy, right?

614
00:52:13,493 --> 00:52:14,160
Oh?

615
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:15,693
You're a spy, right?

616
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:17,326
What spy?

617
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:18,426
Are you a spy?

618
00:52:19,993 --> 00:52:20,826
No, I'm not.

619
00:52:21,126 --> 00:52:22,393
Stop lying!

620
00:52:22,526 --> 00:52:26,660
Who did you meet up with and where did you go just now?

621
00:52:29,326 --> 00:52:30,826
I hear the sound of bells.

622
00:52:34,826 --> 00:52:35,460
Oh!

623
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:36,260
Who?

624
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:37,893
-I don't know! - Oh!

625
00:52:41,426 --> 00:52:44,393
Isn't Kwang Soo a spy?

626
00:52:47,359 --> 00:52:48,393
Noona is a spy?

627
00:52:51,059 --> 00:52:52,326
Noona, you're a spy?

628
00:52:53,826 --> 00:52:54,793
We're both spies!

629
00:52:54,826 --> 00:52:56,093
-You're a spy. too? -That's right.

630
00:52:56,259 --> 00:52:57,493
Noona, you're a complete wily fox.

631
00:53:07,493 --> 00:53:09,993
Because we are spies, so we're on the same team.

632
00:53:10,059 --> 00:53:11,093
We're on the same team?

633
00:53:16,359 --> 00:53:17,826
They are on our team!

634
00:53:17,893 --> 00:53:20,159
Ahh! Hello.

635
00:53:20,193 --> 00:53:21,059
Hello.

636
00:53:23,093 --> 00:53:24,426
One, two, three. Fighting!

637
00:53:24,459 --> 00:53:27,626
But, we're too strong now.

638
00:53:28,126 --> 00:53:29,426
Ah! What to do? It's my first time feeling like that!

639
00:53:29,793 --> 00:53:33,759
So the other members don't know the existence of these two. right?

640
00:53:33,959 --> 00:53:34,959
No, they don't.

641
00:53:35,026 --> 00:53:37,026
So let's split up first.

642
00:53:37,226 --> 00:53:38,493
They are over there!

643
00:53:40,226 --> 00:53:42,593
Hyung! You go catch Jae Suk hyung.

644
00:53:55,493 --> 00:53:58,459
Start from here. One by one.

645
00:54:09,759 --> 00:54:12,626
I'm going crazy! When can I finish looking?

646
00:54:16,126 --> 00:54:17,826
Is this how you switch on a computer?

647
00:54:48,826 --> 00:54:50,993
I'm the hero of the race!

648
00:54:51,226 --> 00:54:53,659
Can you believe it? I'm finally the hero!

649
00:54:59,826 --> 00:55:02,926
Lee Chun Hee. out.' tee Chun Hee, out.'

650
00:55:07,826 --> 00:55:08,759
Me?

651
00:55:09,426 --> 00:55:10,993
Me? I'm out?

652
00:55:16,393 --> 00:55:18,559
Lee Chun Hee got eliminated? Just now?!

653
00:55:20,493 --> 00:55:21,126
How come?

654
00:55:23,626 --> 00:55:25,293
How did Lee Chun Hee get eliminated?

655
00:55:25,693 --> 00:55:27,026
Ah! I can talk using this.

656
00:55:27,259 --> 00:55:29,059
Hey, Chun Hee! What happened?

657
00:55:32,359 --> 00:55:33,226
Chun Hee!

658
00:55:36,093 --> 00:55:37,793
I didn't do anything.

659
00:55:38,159 --> 00:55:39,759
Why am I out?

660
00:55:56,059 --> 00:55:58,293
Hyung, you search around carefully.

661
00:56:00,559 --> 00:56:01,993
I’ll be going.

662
00:56:03,959 --> 00:56:05,359
It's Me.

663
00:56:06,859 --> 00:56:08,226
Chong Wook Ah.

664
00:56:11,926 --> 00:56:15,626
come Over after you Sleep. Don't Cry.

665
00:56:17,126 --> 00:56:18,526
What does this mean?

666
00:56:34,326 --> 00:56:35,693
Don't film me!

667
00:56:58,959 --> 00:57:01,226
Sir! Sir!

668
00:57:01,859 --> 00:57:04,159
Excuse me, but can you sit over here?

669
00:57:05,126 --> 00:57:07,226
I think I'll get caught.

670
00:57:08,593 --> 00:57:10,226
Please help me.

671
00:57:12,693 --> 00:57:14,326
Thank you!

672
00:57:18,526 --> 00:57:19,659
Aren't you cold?

673
00:57:19,659 --> 00:57:20,793
I'm fine.

674
00:57:21,059 --> 00:57:24,526
When there are sound of the bells, I might be in danger.

675
00:57:24,693 --> 00:57:27,559
So if someone wearing a bell asks if there's someone here, please say no.

676
00:57:28,626 --> 00:57:30,259
Just act like you're working.

677
00:57:35,459 --> 00:57:36,593
Anyone got caught?

678
00:57:42,559 --> 00:57:45,426
Thank you! I got to live because of you.

679
00:57:45,693 --> 00:57:47,559
Sir! Thank you so much!

680
00:57:48,493 --> 00:57:49,859
Please sign for me before you go.

681
00:57:49,893 --> 00:57:51,026
Yes, of course.

682
00:58:07,693 --> 00:58:09,493
Why was he eliminated?

683
00:58:09,793 --> 00:58:16,826
Use the computer and enter the password, there has to be a hint then you'll be eliminated.

684
00:58:17,526 --> 00:58:19,959
This was how Chun Hee was eliminated.

685
00:58:20,659 --> 00:58:23,392
So before they find the hints, we have to quickly tear off their name tags.

686
00:58:24,526 --> 00:58:26,059
So we have to move faster?

687
00:58:26,992 --> 00:58:28,792
We have to tell Jin Hee.

688
00:58:31,326 --> 00:58:33,259
How did they eliminate Chun Hee?

689
00:58:34,026 --> 00:58:34,859
Did you see?

690
00:58:34,926 --> 00:58:36,426
- Yeah, I saw. -ls it the same as ours?

691
00:58:39,459 --> 00:58:44,026
What's this? Did any of the Running Men crack the code?

692
00:58:44,859 --> 00:58:46,592
Has anyone cracked the code?

693
00:58:47,459 --> 00:58:50,026
HaHa here. I was the one who eliminated Lee Chun Hee.

694
00:58:50,059 --> 00:58:50,926
How?

695
00:58:51,459 --> 00:58:54,259
They'll get eliminated once you've found the computer.

696
00:58:54,392 --> 00:58:56,292
So now we just have to quickly find the computers,

697
00:58:56,359 --> 00:59:00,026
We have to quickly^finct the computers, so that we can quickly eliminated them.

698
00:59:06,459 --> 00:59:08,259
Quickly find the computers.

699
00:59:14,626 --> 00:59:16,392
Sir, please!

700
00:59:55,559 --> 00:59:56,792
Oh. I'm tired.

701
00:59:57,959 --> 01:00:00,492
I think your coffee is ready!

702
01:00:02,492 --> 01:00:03,926
I'm coming out.

703
01:00:04,059 --> 01:00:06,226
- There's no end to it! - I'm a fan.

704
01:00:09,926 --> 01:00:12,426
I had no choice. I'll see you later.

705
01:00:12,526 --> 01:00:14,092
Am I out just like this?

706
01:00:15,759 --> 01:00:16,726
Hyung, do your best.

707
01:00:16,859 --> 01:00:17,692
Can I take this?

708
01:00:17,726 --> 01:00:18,926
That, you can take home.

709
01:00:19,026 --> 01:00:20,492
Ah, I got it. a souvenir.

710
01:00:20,559 --> 01:00:21,959
Fighting.

711
01:00:22,559 --> 01:00:24,159
You, you, what are you doing?

712
01:00:27,192 --> 01:00:28,692
Hey, Lee Kwang Soo.

713
01:00:29,426 --> 01:00:30,492
What are you doing?

714
01:00:34,026 --> 01:00:35,626
What situation is this?

715
01:00:35,726 --> 01:00:38,759
Gary, out. Gary. out.

716
01:00:54,526 --> 01:00:56,259
Kwang Soo, where are you?

717
01:00:57,292 --> 01:00:59,026
Hyung, l'm on the second floor now.

718
01:01:00,192 --> 01:01:01,492
Where are the Killers?

719
01:01:01,659 --> 01:01:03,792
They're not on the second floor now. Hyung, where are you?

720
01:01:03,959 --> 01:01:05,426
Hyung's on the third floor.

721
01:01:05,592 --> 01:01:07,292
Hyung, I'll go to the third floor first.

722
01:01:07,359 --> 01:01:08,992
Ok, you come over.

723
01:01:09,026 --> 01:01:11,159
Hyung, hyung!

724
01:01:11,226 --> 01:01:12,559
Jong Kook hyung!

725
01:01:12,559 --> 01:01:14,059
Kwang Soo is weird!

726
01:01:14,126 --> 01:01:14,992
Why?

727
01:01:15,026 --> 01:01:16,992
Kwang Soo's acting weird.

728
01:01:17,092 --> 01:01:18,192
-Is that so? - Yes!

729
01:01:24,059 --> 01:01:27,892
Kwang Soo couldn't possibly have survived till now.

730
01:01:27,992 --> 01:01:29,092
That's why!

731
01:01:29,559 --> 01:01:31,592
We have to check over there quickly, hyung.

732
01:01:36,392 --> 01:01:38,992
Jong Kook hyung's must be eliminated by me.

733
01:01:40,459 --> 01:01:43,592
HaHa. you hide at the back, lie In ambush.

734
01:01:46,926 --> 01:01:50,159
Dong Hoon, lock the door when he comes in, got it?

735
01:01:50,192 --> 01:01:51,592
Just lock it.

736
01:01:53,292 --> 01:01:54,359
Kwang Soo.

737
01:01:59,692 --> 01:02:01,292
- Oh hyung, why are you here? -Are you all right?

738
01:02:01,392 --> 01:02:03,726
-Yes. Why are you, why... - Hello.

739
01:02:05,592 --> 01:02:07,092
-Are you alone? -How did you come here?

740
01:02:07,259 --> 01:02:10,359
-Ah, I ran here, what do you mean how I came? - No, how did you come here.

741
01:02:10,459 --> 01:02:12,459
Ah. this here, do you enter the password here?

742
01:02:12,492 --> 01:02:15,126
I didn't do anything, I didn't do anything, I don't know anything.

743
01:02:15,759 --> 01:02:18,926
But hang on. How did you come over here?

744
01:02:19,259 --> 01:02:20,459
I took a plane.

745
01:02:20,492 --> 01:02:23,292
No. no. How did you come into this room?

746
01:02:24,326 --> 01:02:26,726
-I just came along while searching, how else? - Really?

747
01:02:26,926 --> 01:02:28,759
-You came here after searching on your own? -Of course, yes.

748
01:02:28,792 --> 01:02:29,892
-Why, why? -Oh?

749
01:02:29,892 --> 01:02:33,359
-Where did he go, my dongaseng? - What dongsaeng? There's still a dongsaeng?

750
01:02:44,292 --> 01:02:45,959
Why are you. why are you here?

751
01:02:46,192 --> 01:02:47,959
Me, I came to take your nametag.

752
01:02:47,992 --> 01:02:50,392
-Why else would I be here? - Hyung! Ah, hang on.

753
01:02:54,059 --> 01:02:55,726
Don't do this.

754
01:02:55,726 --> 01:02:58,926
- No. no. -Aigoo. just hang in there a little more!

755
01:03:00,292 --> 01:03:01,492
Can't you tear someone else's?

756
01:03:01,659 --> 01:03:03,426
They're all caught, they're all caught.

757
01:03:03,492 --> 01:03:04,526
-Really? -They've all been caught.

758
01:03:09,092 --> 01:03:12,559
Ah hyung, can't you let me off?

759
01:03:53,159 --> 01:03:54,625
Hello.

760
01:03:54,859 --> 01:03:58,259
Has anyone been here? Have you seen the others?

761
01:03:59,125 --> 01:04:00,425
No one came?

762
01:04:08,492 --> 01:04:11,459
Jae Suk hyung!

763
01:04:21,459 --> 01:04:23,459
Hang on, hang on.

764
01:04:24,092 --> 01:04:25,525
Hey, catch him quickly.

765
01:04:25,825 --> 01:04:27,625
Ah, how many of you are there?

766
01:04:27,659 --> 01:04:28,625
Sung Soo.

767
01:04:28,992 --> 01:04:30,025
-Huh? -Sung Soo.

768
01:04:31,092 --> 01:04:32,492
Ah. Sung Soo?

769
01:04:32,659 --> 01:04:33,625
Where?

770
01:04:34,159 --> 01:04:35,359
Where is he?

771
01:04:37,625 --> 01:04:39,059
Sung Soo's here?

772
01:04:39,159 --> 01:04:41,925
Ah, Sung Soo...hey, Kwang Soo. you...

773
01:04:42,392 --> 01:04:45,225

01:04:45,825 --> 01:04:49,159
Hey! Ah, you came too? Hey. you came?

775
01:04:49,992 --> 01:04:51,892
No, when did you come?

776
01:04:52,159 --> 01:04:53,925
Ah, there are four of you.

777
01:04:56,159 --> 01:04:57,125
What?

778
01:05:02,892 --> 01:05:04,259
This is seriously fun.

779
01:05:06,725 --> 01:05:09,925
How many Chasers are there now?

780
01:05:10,859 --> 01:05:15,092
Ah, if you're coming you should have told me, sent me a text or something.

781
01:05:15,359 --> 01:05:16,792
Ah. what are you doing?

782
01:05:23,225 --> 01:05:24,559
Ok, he went up right?

783
01:05:26,359 --> 01:05:27,759
Did he go up? There's no way up.

784
01:05:28,225 --> 01:05:29,525
So did he go down?

785
01:05:31,025 --> 01:05:35,425
Hey. I was chased...hey.l was searching, when they came in!

786
01:05:35,992 --> 01:05:38,359
Hey. how can you not keep up?

787
01:05:55,825 --> 01:05:58,492
Ah, how did I end up here?

788
01:06:01,059 --> 01:06:02,825
I shall leave first!

789
01:06:03,692 --> 01:06:05,192
Ah sure, Sang Wook.

790
01:06:05,692 --> 01:06:07,692
-I'll leave first, I’ll see you later! -Right, right.

791
01:06:07,759 --> 01:06:09,059
Go catch the others first.

792
01:06:09,125 --> 01:06:10,492
Ah yes, I got it!

793
01:06:15,992 --> 01:06:17,625
They normally won’t leave.

794
01:06:17,959 --> 01:06:19,892
Sang Wook won't leave either right?

795
01:06:23,625 --> 01:06:26,992
I'm seriously sorry to the female employees.

796
01:06:27,159 --> 01:06:28,559
I'll stay for awhile and leave.

797
01:06:28,725 --> 01:06:30,425
I’m seriously sorry.

798
01:06:32,859 --> 01:06:35,892
I have to go out and look around.

799
01:06:36,092 --> 01:06:38,659
I can't be hiding in the lounge.

800
01:06:44,059 --> 01:06:46,525
You have to open the door.

801
01:06:46,625 --> 01:06:48,225
What? Ah yes, yes.

802
01:06:49,425 --> 01:06:51,492
-Is someone inside? -I'm sorry, yes.

803
01:06:58,559 --> 01:07:00,125
Ah, thank you for your help.

804
01:07:00,559 --> 01:07:03,192
Why Joo Sang Wook...

805
01:07:03,792 --> 01:07:05,592
No, what's with all this?

806
01:07:05,792 --> 01:07:08,459
No. I was sorry for hiding here just now!

807
01:07:09,059 --> 01:07:10,625
I thought you were sleeping inside.

808
01:07:11,892 --> 01:07:14,192
Did have to do this?

809
01:07:14,492 --> 01:07:15,525
Ah yes, thank you.

810
01:07:15,625 --> 01:07:20,159
How could you help him? I've been caught now.

811
01:07:20,325 --> 01:07:21,925
I'm his fan too!

812
01:07:22,892 --> 01:07:25,625
-I'm sorry, for going into the female lounge. - Yes, thank you.

813
01:07:25,692 --> 01:07:26,859
I'm seriously sorry.

814
01:07:26,959 --> 01:07:28,792
I was just too desperate.

815
01:07:29,725 --> 01:07:32,492
Hyung, you escaped so well, but in the end...

816
01:07:32,492 --> 01:07:33,859
You have to catch hold of him.

817
01:07:34,492 --> 01:07:35,859
Ah. really.

818
01:07:35,959 --> 01:07:37,692
Now we'll...

819
01:07:40,992 --> 01:07:42,325
Hey, Lee Kwang Soo.

820
01:07:43,392 --> 01:07:46,159
Hey, Lee Kwang Soo, you're seriously too much.

821
01:07:52,892 --> 01:07:54,125
Tear them all.

822
01:07:54,425 --> 01:07:56,425
There’s no time, let's go. Let's go up.

823
01:08:01,659 --> 01:08:04,292
-Yoo Jae Suk. Lee Kwang Soo. out. -Me too?

824
01:08:04,425 --> 01:08:05,925
Hey. what are you?

825
01:08:06,425 --> 01:08:07,759
Weren't you a Spy?

826
01:08:08,525 --> 01:08:09,359
I'm a Spy.

827
01:08:09,392 --> 01:08:12,025
Then? Why are you out?

828
01:08:14,392 --> 01:08:15,925
Why are you out?

829
01:08:21,892 --> 01:08:23,125
Hide, hide.

830
01:08:23,858 --> 01:08:25,692
Hide, hide.

831
01:08:31,992 --> 01:08:32,858
Hide, hide.

832
01:08:44,791 --> 01:08:46,325
Daebak,daebak.

833
01:08:46,692 --> 01:08:49,858
I'm the main character, I'm the main character.

834
01:08:50,225 --> 01:08:51,825
I'm the main character of this race!

835
01:08:56,059 --> 01:08:59,524
Joo Sang Wook is out. Joo Sang Wook is out.

836
01:09:01,259 --> 01:09:02,759
Hey Jae Suk, you're out?

837
01:09:02,791 --> 01:09:04,492
Ah, why is Sang Wook here too?

838
01:09:04,559 --> 01:09:05,392
Exactly.

839
01:09:05,392 --> 01:09:09,791
-Chun Hee, you should have told hyung, if you were coming. -Hyung, hello.

840
01:09:09,892 --> 01:09:11,358
Hey, Lee Kwang Soo. you...

841
01:09:11,892 --> 01:09:14,892
- Hey but, wasn't he a Spy? -Why is he out if he's a Spy?

842
01:09:14,959 --> 01:09:17,858
- You were of no use so we got rid of you. -You were of no use.

843
01:09:20,325 --> 01:09:21,425
Greet each other.

844
01:09:21,459 --> 01:09:24,658
If Family Outing had you. Running Man has Kwang Soo.

845
01:09:26,725 --> 01:09:28,492
I've heard a lot about you since I've been here.

846
01:09:29,325 --> 01:09:30,358
No, but now...

847
01:09:31,024 --> 01:09:34,225
Do you know Ji Hyo's with them too?

848
01:09:34,325 --> 01:09:34,892
- Also, it's really... what? -Did you know Ji Hyo's on their side?

849
01:09:34,992 --> 01:09:36,725
-Ji Hyo's on their side. -Why?

850
01:09:36,925 --> 01:09:38,758
-How many Spies are there? -There are two.

851
01:09:40,192 --> 01:09:41,325
Why am I out?

852
01:09:41,325 --> 01:09:41,957
What's the reason?

853
01:09:41,957 --> 01:09:43,558
The Killers were doing very vveii.

854
01:09:43,558 --> 01:09:44,791
What did they do well?

855
01:09:44,925 --> 01:09:48,524
-Earlier, you had other missions, in the day right. -Yes.

856
01:09:49,225 --> 01:09:54,358
During that period, they were recruiting their Spies.

857
01:09:54,458 --> 01:09:55,525
Ah, really?

858
01:09:55,792 --> 01:09:58,292
They were at the market and Odong Island the whole time.

859
01:09:58,392 --> 01:09:59,458
Since when?

860
01:10:00,425 --> 01:10:02,492
Ah. when we were purchasing the items?

861
01:10:02,492 --> 01:10:04,358
I. I was In a Mason.

862
01:10:05,325 --> 01:10:06,325
I was in a Mason.

863
01:10:06,325 --> 01:10:07,925
Being with spies like you...

864
01:10:07,925 --> 01:10:08,958
This informant!

865
01:10:09,225 --> 01:10:12,692
You're really the informant, hey!

866
01:10:12,792 --> 01:10:15,158
Hey, but why are you here, you're the Spy.

867
01:10:15,158 --> 01:10:16,792
Ah, what's with him?

868
01:10:16,792 --> 01:10:18,225
Which side am I on, what am I?

869
01:10:18,325 --> 01:10:19,692
Ok. have fun!

870
01:10:19,758 --> 01:10:21,425
That walkie-talkie, isn't that ours?

871
01:10:29,958 --> 01:10:32,392
Sir, let us use the Internet for awhile.

872
01:10:33,825 --> 01:10:37,092
Yes. can we search for this, 'the creator of the turtle ship'?

873
01:10:38,225 --> 01:10:39,292
It's coming out, it's out.

874
01:10:47,458 --> 01:10:48,858
See! It's done, it's done.

875
01:11:00,925 --> 01:11:02,725
Let’s check this too.

876
01:11:02,758 --> 01:11:05,158
Ah! 'Never tell the enemy the news of my death'.

877
01:11:05,158 --> 01:11:07,092
That's what I was saying.

878
01:11:08,192 --> 01:11:12,058
'Never tell the enemy the news .of my death1.

879
01:11:15,225 --> 01:11:16,625
Thank you.Thank you.

880
01:11:17,658 --> 01:11:19,158
-Anyone there -No one.

881
01:11:19,192 --> 01:11:24,458
Ji Hyo, about this. Tell Jong Kook hyung about it.

882
01:11:24,825 --> 01:11:26,792
He's on the first floor, the first floor.

883
01:11:27,692 --> 01:11:29,992
Jong Kook hyung, Jong Kook hyung. do you hear me?

884
01:11:41,292 --> 01:11:42,692
Hey, it's just left with us both.

885
01:11:43,225 --> 01:11:44,558
Ji Hyo, HaHa.

886
01:11:45,158 --> 01:11:46,358
Ah, HaHa!

887
01:11:46,392 --> 01:11:47,992
Hey, HaHa has to be caught.

888
01:11:48,325 --> 01:11:49,925
Where is HaHa?

889
01:11:50,625 --> 01:11:53,058
We don't even know where HaHa is and he's been searching all this while.

890
01:12:01,425 --> 01:12:03,025
Dong Hoon, where are you?

891
01:12:04,925 --> 01:12:06,058
Ji Hyo.

892
01:12:06,058 --> 01:12:08,258
What? I'm together with HaHa oppa!

893
01:12:10,725 --> 01:12:12,325
Oppa, let's go to the first floor.

894
01:12:12,325 --> 01:12:13,992
Let's go, let's go.

895
01:12:17,525 --> 01:12:18,658
Hey, hey.

896
01:12:18,958 --> 01:12:20,358
Hey Ji Hyo. run!

897
01:12:24,925 --> 01:12:25,992
Oppa!

898
01:12:37,992 --> 01:12:39,358
Not me!

899
01:12:39,558 --> 01:12:41,858
Ah, so frustrating!

900
01:12:41,858 --> 01:12:43,525
Ji Hyo, run!

901
01:12:48,358 --> 01:12:50,158
Come here, come here.

902
01:12:54,392 --> 01:12:56,858
Ah. hyung!

903
01:12:57,058 --> 01:12:58,592
Hang on!

904
01:12:58,592 --> 01:12:59,658
Ji Hyo! Ji Hyo!

905
01:12:59,658 --> 01:13:01,458
Who is it? Oh man. Sung Soo hyung's here too?

906
01:13:08,425 --> 01:13:09,725
Done.

907
01:13:10,358 --> 01:13:12,325
- How have you been? -Oh man, you've worked hard.

908
01:13:12,325 --> 01:13:15,592
Song Ji Hyo, out. Song Ji Hyo. out.

909
01:13:15,592 --> 01:13:16,792
Only one left.

910
01:13:16,792 --> 01:13:19,358
Ah. you guys are too brutal! Ah, being like this...

911
01:13:20,658 --> 01:13:22,525
Ah, we're all dead!

912
01:13:22,658 --> 01:13:24,225
What will happen to the Running Men?

913
01:13:24,225 --> 01:13:26,125
- HaHa. out. -Ah. shut it!

914
01:13:26,592 --> 01:13:28,925
We have to finish this quickly, otherwise we'll be dead.

915
01:13:28,925 --> 01:13:31,692
On your way here earlier, wasn't there some computers left unchecked?

916
01:13:31,825 --> 01:13:32,925
Turn off all the monitors.

917
01:13:33,425 --> 01:13:34,558
Turn them off!

918
01:13:35,092 --> 01:13:37,392
Otherwise they'll know those havn't been checked right?

919
01:13:37,392 --> 01:13:38,758
The others have been completed.

920
01:13:38,758 --> 01:13:40,158
Oh, exactly.

921
01:13:56,058 --> 01:13:57,892
Ah, sitting here is really lonesome.

922
01:13:58,625 --> 01:14:00,592
Sang Wook. you have to try it out.

923
01:14:00,592 --> 01:14:03,525
Then what's that paper there, there?

924
01:14:04,125 --> 01:14:05,925
This seems to be a prank by Ha Dong Hoon.

925
01:14:05,925 --> 01:14:08,458
- Hey, then now the other team... -No no. There must be more than this.

926
01:14:08,458 --> 01:14:10,725
They're just left with both Ji Jin Hee and Kim. Kim Sung Soo right?

927
01:14:12,925 --> 01:14:15,325
Firstly, what's T?

928
01:14:16,625 --> 01:14:18,025
'Tomorrow'.

929
01:14:24,058 --> 01:14:25,158
Do you know? What?

930
01:14:26,392 --> 01:14:28,658
This seems like there's a mission.

931
01:14:29,458 --> 01:14:31,725
Does it make sense? Does it make sense?

932
01:14:32,692 --> 01:14:34,225
Heyraren't you on our side?

933
01:14:34,225 --> 01:14:35,525
Hyung, we're on the same side.

934
01:14:35,525 --> 01:14:36,858
You're not, you!

935
01:14:36,858 --> 01:14:38,025
I'm hot even a spy.

936
01:14:38,025 --> 01:14:39,358
You're the Spy!

937
01:14:39,358 --> 01:14:41,092
-I'm not. -You are the spy.

938
01:14:41,192 --> 01:14:43,392
Do I have to be sorry towards yungs?'

939
01:14:43,458 --> 01:14:45,225
-Of course! -Of course you have to be sorry.

940
01:14:46,492 --> 01:14:47,492
What about to hyungs?'

941
01:14:47,492 --> 01:14:48,758
You're also hot on our side now!

942
01:14:48,758 --> 01:14:50,358
Of course you should be sorry to us.

943
01:14:50,358 --> 01:14:52,392
-Ah, Chun Hee's right. - You're an outsider now.

944
01:14:52,558 --> 01:14:54,392
He keeps swaying both ways, going back and forth.

945
01:14:56,192 --> 01:14:57,725
I'm so curious about this.

946
01:14:57,758 --> 01:14:59,258
I know this now.

947
01:14:59,258 --> 01:15:00,358
Really?

948
01:15:00,725 --> 01:15:02,858
-Can I reveal this? -'Midday tomorrow',

949
01:15:02,891 --> 01:15:04,958
actly, this is 'Midday tomorrow'.

950
01:15:04,958 --> 01:15:06,758
This is clearly 'Midday tomorrow'.

951
01:15:06,758 --> 01:15:09,191
'Midday tomorrow...'

952
01:15:10,958 --> 01:15:12,791
Hey Song Ji HytT why did you do that?

953
01:15:12,791 --> 01:15:13,858
HaHa's out.

954
01:15:13,858 --> 01:15:15,991
Never tell the enemy the news of my death.

955
01:15:15,991 --> 01:15:18,091
Have you been staring at it but not figuring it out?

956
01:15:19,091 --> 01:15:20,858
’Never tell the enemy...'

957
01:15:25,491 --> 01:15:27,658
Ji Hyo, isn't it’Midday tomorrow'?

958
01:15:27,925 --> 01:15:29,058
isn't it 'Midday tomorrow'?

959
01:15:29,058 --> 01:15:31,691
What? What did you say, what did you say?

960
01:15:31,725 --> 01:15:33,891
Isn't it 'Midday tomorrow'?

961
01:15:33,925 --> 01:15:35,091
Aigoo. seriously!

962
01:15:35,425 --> 01:15:38,191
Aigoo. I can't take it, I can't take it.

963
01:15:38,191 --> 01:15:39,925
-'Midday.tomorrow...' -It was all your own thinking.

964
01:15:39,925 --> 01:15:40,991
'Jae Dong goes'.

965
01:15:44,591 --> 01:15:47,058
It wasn't just.me. You saw Sang Wook right?

966
01:15:47,058 --> 01:15:49,991
Aigoo. it's 'tomorrow', 'midday tomorrow'.

967
01:15:50,225 --> 01:15:52,825
Hey, Sang Wook was behind while we were puzzling over it!

968
01:15:52,991 --> 01:15:55,025
Ah, everyone was going. "Hey, how did you know?"

969
01:15:55,025 --> 01:15:56,391
I thought I got it too.

970
01:15:56,491 --> 01:15:57,525
Hey, HaHa's out?

971
01:15:57,525 --> 01:15:59,158
Ji Hyo's the Spy.

972
01:15:59,325 --> 01:16:01,558
Oppa. I'm really the Spy!

973
01:16:01,558 --> 01:16:02,825
You're the Spy too?

974
01:16:02,825 --> 01:16:05,091
-He's a Spy too. -I'm a Spy.

975
01:16:05,091 --> 01:16:06,458
Hey, how many Spies are there?

976
01:16:06,491 --> 01:16:08,591
-That's why I, I... - Wait a minute.

977
01:16:08,591 --> 01:16:11,825
- Why did you tear Kwang Soo's off, Kwang Soo? -Ah, Kwang Soo was too obvious for the oppas.

978
01:16:11,925 --> 01:16:12,925
He's too obvious.

979
01:16:12,958 --> 01:16:14,391
We were about to die, so we were discussing it.

980
01:16:14,391 --> 01:16:18,791
-But he was still alive when he just suddenly... -Ah, how can you pick Spies like this?

981
01:16:18,791 --> 01:16:20,558
Can you carry out the game like this?

982
01:16:20,558 --> 01:16:21,991
You can’t do this kind of game.

983
01:16:21,991 --> 01:16:23,758
It's just Jong Kook left, didn't you see him?

984
01:16:23,758 --> 01:16:25,191
I caught Jong Kook, I did.

985
01:16:25,191 --> 01:16:25,991
And then?

986
01:16:25,991 --> 01:16:27,858
After catching him, I was tearing it midway.

987
01:16:27,958 --> 01:16:29,525
When he pleaded for me to let him survive.

988
01:16:31,358 --> 01:16:32,858
Really?

989
01:16:32,858 --> 01:16:35,225
Ah, Kim Jong Kook pleaded?

990
01:16:36,825 --> 01:16:38,858
Ah hyung, can't you just let me off this once?

991
01:16:44,758 --> 01:16:47,491
-Wow, he really did it. -Oh, he really did.

992
01:16:47,491 --> 01:16:48,991
There was even someone filming it right?

993
01:16:49,058 --> 01:16:50,758
-Ah. did he really plead? -Of course.

994
01:16:52,858 --> 01:16:53,725
What's this?

995
01:16:53,725 --> 01:16:57,791
-Hey, he tore Jin Hee's off... -I'll show you something shocking.

996
01:16:57,825 --> 01:16:59,458
I still have one more inside.

997
01:17:00,225 --> 01:17:03,358
No one would believe it, no one would believe it.

998
01:17:03,358 --> 01:17:06,025
No one would believe it.

999
01:17:07,058 --> 01:17:08,191
Who is out?

1000
01:17:08,891 --> 01:17:10,925
Kim Si mg Soo. out.

1001
01:17:15,391 --> 01:17:16,991
Well done!

1002
01:17:19,158 --> 01:17:21,158
Ah, why did you come in here?

1003
01:17:34,458 --> 01:17:36,191
Kim Sung Soo, out.

1004
01:17:36,325 --> 01:17:37,958
Kim Sung Soo, out.

1005
01:17:40,658 --> 01:17:43,058
Ah, why did you come in here?

1006
01:17:44,591 --> 01:17:46,258
Ah, why are you here?

1007
01:17:46,458 --> 01:17:48,091
Hey Kim Sung Soo, what are you doing?

1008
01:17:48,091 --> 01:17:50,758
It's not the time for me to stay here.

1009
01:17:50,925 --> 01:17:53,558
-You have to catch someone. - Don’t get caught while trying to catch others.

1010
01:17:53,558 --> 01:17:55,958
I'll leave first. Ok.

1011
01:18:11,791 --> 01:18:13,525
Hey, why are there so many?

1012
01:18:13,525 --> 01:18:14,925
The computers...

1013
01:18:40,758 --> 01:18:42,525
Oh, I'm about to die.

1014
01:18:45,458 --> 01:18:46,825
Please!

1015
01:18:46,825 --> 01:18:48,558
Ah. this is seriously...

1016
01:18:49,858 --> 01:18:51,325
-You can't find it right? -What?

1017
01:18:52,325 --> 01:18:53,625
Ah, I'm so tired.

1018
01:18:55,725 --> 01:18:59,491
How did you come in here, hyung?

1019
01:19:46,791 --> 01:19:48,591
This is it. This is it.

1020
01:19:49,391 --> 01:19:51,325
That's why I have to turn off the monitors.

1021
01:19:51,325 --> 01:19:52,591
What's this?

1022
01:19:58,925 --> 01:20:00,891
It should be like this.

1023
01:20:00,891 --> 01:20:02,658
It would be alright if I turn off the monitors.

1024
01:20:02,658 --> 01:20:06,158
I need to turn off those which are already turned on.

1025
01:20:06,158 --> 01:20:07,758
Here, there is one already.

1026
01:20:07,758 --> 01:20:10,191
So there isn't anymore here already.

1027
01:20:10,191 --> 01:20:13,391
There won't be 2 here.

1028
01:20:35,891 --> 01:20:39,891
Why are there so many?

1029
01:20:45,891 --> 01:20:47,891
This has not been pressed before.

1030
01:20:47,891 --> 01:20:49,891
He looks like he is in a rush?

1031
01:20:50,258 --> 01:20:53,891
Ok, the 3rd floor is done.

1032
01:21:04,324 --> 01:21:05,924
Where is it?

1033
01:21:16,891 --> 01:21:20,258
Ok, ok, ok.

1034
01:21:20,858 --> 01:21:23,258
It's not here, then...

1035
01:22:44,924 --> 01:22:46,991
Why are there so many?

1036
01:23:01,958 --> 01:23:04,591
We still do not know the end result.

1037
01:23:04,591 --> 01:23:06,024
Now it's 1v1.

1038
01:23:06,258 --> 01:23:09,458
-Hyung, Jin Hee hyung looks like he's going to win. -Jin Hee will win.

1039
01:23:09,558 --> 01:23:12,091
Jin Hee's body is full of muscles.

1040
01:23:19,924 --> 01:23:22,458
What happens if the two battle base on strength?

1041
01:23:22,458 --> 01:23:24,024
Jin Hee hyung is really strong!

1042
01:23:25,424 --> 01:23:28,491
-The kid is doing rock climbing... - Really?

1043
01:23:28,858 --> 01:23:30,991
You looked that up from the internet right?!

1044
01:23:32,024 --> 01:23:34,858
Jin Hee told me over the phone.

1045
01:24:28,047 --> 01:24:30,116
Ah, l'm going crazy.

1046
01:24:30,282 --> 01:24:33,552
It's a battle between beasts, battle between beasts.

1047
01:24:33,552 --> 01:24:37,390
-The person who is laughing would have won. -I feel like Jong Kook would win.

1048
01:24:37,390 --> 01:24:39,358
They're here!

1049
01:24:39,358 --> 01:24:40,359
Who won?

1050
01:24:41,794 --> 01:24:43,095
What happened to the two of you?

1051
01:24:43,129 --> 01:24:46,098
-Jong Kook hyung won. Jong Kook hyung won. - It looks like Jong Kook won.

1052
01:25:01,680 --> 01:25:05,451
How did Jong Kook hyung lose?

1053
01:25:46,225 --> 01:25:47,993
No. when did you get in here?

1054
01:25:50,029 --> 01:25:51,197
How did you come in?

1055
01:26:05,377 --> 01:26:07,580
I nearly found it, really...

1056
01:26:08,280 --> 01:26:11,016
The last room, hyung was also in it.

1057
01:26:11,016 --> 01:26:12,885
Hyung locked the room too.

1058
01:26:12,885 --> 01:26:16,122
-My plan was to lock all the doors. -It was too tiring.

1059
01:26:16,122 --> 01:26:19,925
The battle between the beasts, the lion and the tiger.

1060
01:26:20,459 --> 01:26:25,264
-In the end it was a mental battle, a mental battle. -They, so which side are they on?

1061
01:26:25,264 --> 01:26:28,734
-You are of course on the Running Man side. -See!

1062
01:26:28,734 --> 01:26:31,570
I’ll see you off-the-camera, Kwang Soo.

1063
01:26:31,570 --> 01:26:33,105
Quickly turn off the cameras!

1064
01:26:35,774 --> 01:26:36,775
This is really...

1065
01:26:39,979 --> 01:26:41,947
They even give the meat, really.

1066
01:26:42,148 --> 01:26:43,082
It's Korean beef.

1067
01:26:44,083 --> 01:26:45,417
Is that Yeosu mustard leaf kimchi?^

1068
01:26:48,721 --> 01:26:51,957
Wait! Why... are you removing the kimchi?

1069
01:26:51,957 --> 01:26:53,826
They suddenly didn't want to give it.

1070
01:27:10,109 --> 01:27:11,010
Keep going!

1071
01:27:11,744 --> 01:27:13,812
What can you do well?

1072
01:27:14,544 --> 01:27:16,140
Ah what is this?

1073
01:27:18,640 --> 01:27:21,720
Last chance, our last chance

1074
01:27:21,880 --> 01:27:23,400
The sleeves also have numbers and symbols

1075
01:27:23,408 --> 01:27:26,928
-The most important thing is that we have to find it quickly. -I found it!
