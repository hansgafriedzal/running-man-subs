1
00:00:19,303 --> 00:00:20,571
Ah, mother!

2
00:00:23,507 --> 00:00:24,809
Do you choose to die or be a Spy?

3
00:00:24,809 --> 00:00:26,010
Spy,Spy!

4
00:00:26,477 --> 00:00:27,778
Oppa!

5
00:00:27,778 --> 00:00:29,313
Ah hyung,can't you let me off this once?

6
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:30,681
There's just one left!

7
00:01:05,616 --> 00:01:09,653
The whispered secrets as I look at the clock

8
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:17,995
The stories in my heart I long for most

9
00:01:20,031 --> 00:01:22,700
It's all right if I'm

10
00:01:23,167 --> 00:01:27,772
It's all right if I'm pushed

11
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:31,709
Please call out my name

12
00:01:31,909 --> 00:01:36,013
From the gaps between my hands

13
00:01:39,116 --> 00:01:42,353
I'm afriad my heart will be revealed

14
00:01:45,423 --> 00:01:49,126
My heart's overwhelmed with sadness

15
00:01:49,193 --> 00:01:53,731
Please wait a little while for me

16
00:01:53,798 --> 00:01:57,468
You and I, can't be now

17
00:01:57,535 --> 00:02:01,939
Althought I want to make the clock go faster

18
00:02:03,007 --> 00:02:05,843
In the future you'll be in

19
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:09,246
Please call me out my name

20
00:02:16,287 --> 00:02:18,289
Please come out, all of you please come out.

21
00:02:18,355 --> 00:02:22,460
Ah,  don't just, stand there and watching.

22
00:02:22,526 --> 00:02:24,228
All of you, please come out.

23
00:02:24,328 --> 00:02:26,897
Why aren't they coming out?

24
00:02:26,964 --> 00:02:31,802
I'm afriad my heart will be revealed from the gaps between my hands

25
00:02:32,837 --> 00:02:36,574
My heart's overwhelmed with sadness

26
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:41,045
Please wait a little while for me

27
00:02:41,112 --> 00:02:44,748
You and I, can't be now

28
00:02:44,815 --> 00:02:49,053
Althought I want to make the clock go faster

29
00:02:50,121 --> 00:02:53,624
In the future you'll be in

30
00:02:53,691 --> 00:02:57,128
Please call me out my name

31
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:09,707
You and I, can't be now

32
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:13,878
Althought I want to make the clock go faster

33
00:03:14,912 --> 00:03:17,848
In the future you'll be in

34
00:03:17,915 --> 00:03:21,785
If I were to wander

35
00:03:21,819 --> 00:03:25,456
In order that I may recognize you

36
00:03:25,489 --> 00:03:30,060
Please call me out my name

37
00:03:47,011 --> 00:03:48,379
-Thank you. -IU!

38
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,248
Wow.

39
00:03:51,248 --> 00:03:54,418
Yes, will the remaining please come out quickly?

40
00:03:54,485 --> 00:03:57,388
It seems like, there's something to do with order, or doing something like that now.

41
00:03:57,421 --> 00:03:59,590
Seems like you have to come out quickly?

42
00:03:59,657 --> 00:04:03,994
Now, five people have already come out.

43
00:04:11,702 --> 00:04:14,738
Yes, please just stand accordingly in this order.

44
00:04:20,911 --> 00:04:23,347
Today will surely be a good day too.

45
00:04:25,883 --> 00:04:26,850
Yi yoo!

46
00:04:26,917 --> 00:04:30,054
Yi-yoo!Yi-yoo!

47
00:04:30,087 --> 00:04:34,892
Why is the sky today so blue?

48
00:04:34,925 --> 00:04:36,126
IU!

49
00:04:38,596 --> 00:04:42,566
It just happens the wind today is that perfect

50
00:04:45,736 --> 00:04:49,873
Pretending not to know, pretending not to hear a word

51
00:04:49,907 --> 00:04:53,444
Pretending to forget and start a new topic

52
00:04:53,477 --> 00:04:58,115
In order to close you lips, can I kiss you

53
00:04:59,149 --> 00:05:02,886
With tears welling up and lifting my head

54
00:05:02,886 --> 00:05:06,724
Not letting the tears fall and giving a smile

55
00:05:06,757 --> 00:05:11,595
Why are you treating me like this, I don't know what I'm saying

56
00:05:11,629 --> 00:05:14,164
Everything we said today will be thrown to the sky

57
00:05:14,198 --> 00:05:18,269
Wrods I 've never said before, words I didn't know were said while crying

58
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:25,576
I like Who? You, oppa

59
00:05:32,483 --> 00:05:34,685
What do I do

60
00:05:35,352 --> 00:05:35,886
IU, IU!

61
00:05:49,366 --> 00:05:52,636
I even thought they were playing an album but she's really here.

62
00:05:53,904 --> 00:05:55,773
IU, IU!

63
00:05:55,873 --> 00:06:00,344
Ah, who wore my shoes?

64
00:06:11,388 --> 00:06:12,956
It's done as long as everyone's here right?

65
00:06:13,023 --> 00:06:15,926
Will the last few people hurry up too?

66
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:20,597
Was my new hairstyle very bad?

67
00:06:20,664 --> 00:06:21,465
Come quickly, hurry.

68
00:06:24,068 --> 00:06:28,272
Are the clothes I'm wearing today unsuitable?

69
00:06:28,305 --> 00:06:29,273
Hello

70
00:06:31,675 --> 00:06:35,346
Pretending not to konw, pretending that I don't remember

71
00:06:35,379 --> 00:06:39,016
Should I just pretend nothing even happened?

72
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:44,054
Should I just get you to out?

73
00:06:44,121 --> 00:06:48,592
With tears welling up and lifting my head

74
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:52,329
Not letting the tears fall and giving a smile

75
00:06:52,363 --> 00:06:56,033
Why are you treating me like this, I don't know what I'm saying

76
00:06:56,066 --> 00:06:59,837
Everything we said today will be thrown to the sky

77
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:03,640
Wrods I 've never said before, words I didn't know were said while crying

78
00:07:07,678 --> 00:07:12,449
I like you, oppa

79
00:07:12,483 --> 00:07:16,820
What do I do

80
00:07:21,859 --> 00:07:23,894
Yes, thank you everyone, I'm IU.

81
00:07:23,927 --> 00:07:24,962
IU, IU!

82
00:07:25,629 --> 00:07:26,630
Yes

83
00:07:26,697 --> 00:07:29,600
-What's this really about, Yi-yoo? -Daebak.

84
00:07:29,633 --> 00:07:32,202
Why did you tell IU, to do this sort of thing?

85
00:07:32,236 --> 00:07:33,570
Are you even thinking straight?

86
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:36,206
Exactly.

87
00:07:37,007 --> 00:07:40,010
NO, no, why must Yi-yoo do this so early...

88
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:42,813
-Because Miss IU is Yeosu's Goodwill Ambassador. -Ah, really?

89
00:07:42,846 --> 00:07:47,351
Earlier on, IU, was beside Chun Hee.

90
00:07:48,051 --> 00:07:49,920
Ji Jin hyung said this.

91
00:07:49,987 --> 00:07:52,189
"Ah, looks like she'll be paired with Chun Hee, he must be so happy."

92
00:07:56,226 --> 00:07:58,962
I even thought he was the owner of this pension.

93
00:07:59,029 --> 00:08:01,365
That's right.

94
00:08:01,432 --> 00:08:05,736
-Ok, let me say something. -Yes.

95
00:08:05,769 --> 00:08:07,638
The teams have just been assigned now!

96
00:08:07,638 --> 00:08:08,138
-How? -What?

97
00:08:08,138 --> 00:08:10,007
How did you split the teams?

98
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:12,075
Starting from Miss IU at Number 1 all the way to Number 4, you're a team.

99
00:08:20,818 --> 00:08:22,653
Hey, you're really...

100
00:08:22,686 --> 00:08:25,989
Ok, from Song Ji Hyo at Number 5 to Yoo Jea Suk at Number 8, you're a team.

101
00:08:26,056 --> 00:08:28,425
Ah, seriously.

102
00:08:28,692 --> 00:08:31,728
-Do you feel it's a pity? -No, although it's all good...

103
00:08:33,797 --> 00:08:36,500
Can't we just group the eight together?

104
00:08:36,533 --> 00:08:39,036
Number 1 to Number 8 like this.

105
00:08:39,069 --> 00:08:41,138
Why don't we just let IU choose on her own?

106
00:08:41,171 --> 00:08:45,209
Ok also, from Ji Suk Jin at Number 9 to Jong Kook at Number 12, you're a team.

107
00:08:46,276 --> 00:08:48,312
Ah, I'm Number 12, me?

108
00:08:48,378 --> 00:08:51,748
Why don't we group ourselves?

109
00:08:51,782 --> 00:08:55,252
-Just let IU choose her own team. -Exactly.

110
00:08:55,285 --> 00:08:57,254
Ah, it's a good idea.

111
00:08:57,287 --> 00:09:01,725
Jeez, if it's like this, if it's like this, Boss, IU coming here...

112
00:09:01,758 --> 00:09:04,361
Then there's no point in her coming here to sing in the morning.

113
00:09:04,428 --> 00:09:05,729
I'm the owner.

114
00:09:07,431 --> 00:09:07,998
Just do what I say.

115
00:09:07,998 --> 00:09:10,234
But these things are still better said early.

116
00:09:10,267 --> 00:09:13,504
Hey, but Sang Wook too, after removing the suit, you're really...hey.

117
00:09:13,537 --> 00:09:15,839
You couldn't recognize him?

118
00:09:15,873 --> 00:09:17,541
I couldn't even recognize him.

119
00:09:19,076 --> 00:09:22,646
He, looks so comfortable, like a neighborhood hyung.

120
00:09:22,713 --> 00:09:25,482
Hey, Chun Hee's really, reminds us of his image in Family Outing.

121
00:09:25,516 --> 00:09:28,886
What I saw on television, is just like what I'm seeing in front of me!

122
00:09:29,887 --> 00:09:30,487
I was also shocked.

123
00:09:30,587 --> 00:09:32,956
Whatever it is, there are two Gwang Soos here.

124
00:09:34,558 --> 00:09:36,627
But what's this, what is it, Yi-yoo?

125
00:09:36,627 --> 00:09:38,128
This was, given to me.

126
00:09:38,128 --> 00:09:39,329
-By whom? -Sung Soo hyung gave it to her when he came out.

127
00:09:40,497 --> 00:09:43,100
When someone comes in the moring a flower basket should be prepared.

128
00:09:43,133 --> 00:09:46,103
Ah hyung, what's with the sunglasses in the morning?

129
00:09:46,136 --> 00:09:47,638
Make-up!

130
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,807
It's really make-up, make-up.

131
00:09:50,874 --> 00:09:52,643
Ah seriously, you're really...

132
00:09:52,743 --> 00:09:54,778
The decision should still be given to you IU.

133
00:09:54,845 --> 00:09:56,079
Ok...

134
00:09:56,179 --> 00:09:59,883
Jin Hee, listen to what he has to say.

135
00:09:59,917 --> 00:10:02,519
-Anyhow, IU already has her group. -Boss, you're too blunt with your words!

136
00:10:02,586 --> 00:10:04,888
-Why don't you we let IU choose instead? -He keeps mumbling by himself.

137
00:10:04,922 --> 00:10:09,226
Why do you put your hands in those pockets?Put them down here.

138
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:13,330
You're supposed to be the Big Sunbae

139
00:10:13,363 --> 00:10:15,232
-I suppose you're all hungry? -We are.

140
00:10:15,265 --> 00:10:18,936
So, the mission we have prepared today is...

141
00:10:18,969 --> 00:10:20,170
A Tasty Bingo Race.

142
00:10:20,237 --> 00:10:24,074
We will hand out a bingo board containing all the famous dishes of Yeosu to each team.

143
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:45,095
You go to the restaurant of your choice, eat the dish

144
00:10:45,128 --> 00:10:47,264
And complete the mission to complete one square on your bingo board.

145
00:10:47,297 --> 00:10:51,268
Complete a straight line using three adjacent squares to achieve bingo and win a humongous advantage in the final mission.

146
00:10:57,307 --> 00:11:00,010
A huge advantage?

147
00:11:00,077 --> 00:11:02,512
We will start immediately after you change into your team uniform.

148
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:06,483
-White car! -I think it's this one.

149
00:11:06,516 --> 00:11:10,654
I...I need to shake hands with IU first.

150
00:11:10,687 --> 00:11:13,890
-IU, can we shake hands? -Oh! Of course.

151
00:11:13,957 --> 00:11:15,826
-You have to take your gloves off first. -Ah, yes.

152
00:11:15,859 --> 00:11:18,595
Thank you very much.Please get in.

153
00:11:18,629 --> 00:11:20,931
-Let me get that. -Oh thank you.

154
00:11:27,137 --> 00:11:30,307
I can't believe I got to shake hands with IU.

155
00:11:30,374 --> 00:11:31,908
-You sound like you're never seen IU before. -This my first time meeting her.

156
00:11:31,975 --> 00:11:34,144
-Really? You first time? -I still can't believe my eyes.

157
00:11:34,211 --> 00:11:35,879
-The two of you... Hyung! -Really?

158
00:11:35,912 --> 00:11:38,248
What I can't believe is that you and her even know each other.

159
00:11:39,416 --> 00:11:40,884
All right here's the plan.

160
00:11:40,951 --> 00:11:43,854
We eat whatever IU wants to eat.

161
00:11:43,887 --> 00:11:45,656
-Agreed? -Of course.

162
00:11:45,689 --> 00:11:48,125
-Can I do that...? -Whatever you want to eat first.

163
00:11:48,158 --> 00:11:50,994
The best choice would be to eat the middle one first.

164
00:11:51,028 --> 00:11:53,697
-The one in the centre. -It would be wouldn't it?

165
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:55,866
I want to eat all of them!

166
00:11:57,434 --> 00:11:58,035
-We only need to check off three don't we? -Yeah.

167
00:11:58,135 --> 00:12:01,672
Then, oyster?

168
00:12:01,705 --> 00:12:03,707
-Okay! Oyster is fine. -Are you all right with oyster?

169
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:05,008
Yeah I love it.

170
00:12:05,042 --> 00:12:06,743
-Is there anything you can't eat? -No I'm fine with all of them.

171
00:12:06,777 --> 00:12:09,146
-Can we start right away? -Of course you can!

172
00:12:09,179 --> 00:12:11,782
-Then shall we have spicy seasoned crab to start the day? -Gatkimchi and rice!

173
00:12:11,848 --> 00:12:13,784
He suggests we go for "spicy seasoned crad to start the day."

174
00:12:17,821 --> 00:12:20,590
Spicy seasoned crab in the morning HaHaHaHa.

175
00:12:21,024 --> 00:12:23,126
You know, I've already been in a program with Sang Wook before.

176
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:26,430
He actually has a lot of weak spots.

177
00:12:26,463 --> 00:12:29,066
-People with this kind of laugh. -HaHaHaHa!

178
00:12:29,132 --> 00:12:31,068
They're full of weak spots. See? Like this: HaHaHaHa!

179
00:12:31,301 --> 00:12:34,237
-Anyway we should first start moving. Ji Hyo? -Here. Yes.

180
00:12:34,271 --> 00:12:35,572
Where are we going?

181
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:38,442
-Let's go with what Sang Wook hyung wants to eat. -Sang Wook we'll go with what you want to eat.

182
00:12:38,508 --> 00:12:42,479
Then how about we start with Seodae Spiced Sashimi?

183
00:12:42,512 --> 00:12:45,849
-Okay then let's try there. -The way you speak is very clear and precise though.

184
00:12:45,882 --> 00:12:48,885
Wait, no, this won't work.

185
00:12:48,919 --> 00:12:50,987
Of course not, Sang Woo this pen is...

186
00:12:51,054 --> 00:12:55,392
-It's to work with the PC. -Now I see what this laughter means.

187
00:12:55,425 --> 00:12:56,927
I told you.

188
00:12:57,027 --> 00:12:59,563
Hold on this isn't Gwagju.

189
00:12:59,596 --> 00:13:02,766
-You have to select Jeonnam. -Jeonnam isn't being selected though.

190
00:13:02,766 --> 00:13:03,433
Isn't not working?

191
00:13:05,235 --> 00:13:07,337
-Oh, it's working. -Yes it is.

192
00:13:07,404 --> 00:13:08,538
How could it not work?

193
00:13:08,572 --> 00:13:13,510
This is embarrassing.

194
00:13:17,581 --> 00:13:20,851
So...Does anyone have any IU songs downloaded?

195
00:13:23,553 --> 00:13:24,654
You must have some.

196
00:13:24,688 --> 00:13:27,724
Wow, you really have them.

197
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:41,605
This morning I woke up, heard this song and looked out the window,

198
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:46,943
And when I saw IU there singing,

199
00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:50,781
I... I just... Is this... something that could really happen?

200
00:13:54,885 --> 00:13:57,854
-And there's that part of the song. -Yes.

201
00:13:57,888 --> 00:14:01,792
The sight of IU singing in the morning light with the rising sun as a back drop...

202
00:14:10,734 --> 00:14:13,637
We’re one team for the rest of the day, right?

203
00:14:13,703 --> 00:14:16,306
-That would be lovely. -We'll stay one team, right?

204
00:14:30,987 --> 00:14:34,958
-We should have gone with oyster first! -Because the oyster is the middle one.

205
00:14:34,991 --> 00:14:39,496
-We should have picked oysters. In bingo, you always pick the middle. -Exactly!

206
00:14:39,596 --> 00:14:42,365
Hyung we only have to finish one line though don't we?

207
00:14:42,432 --> 00:14:43,266
We need a plan.

208
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:46,336
-So this is the bingo board. -Ah,here.

209
00:14:46,369 --> 00:14:48,104
-Use the pen. -No?

210
00:14:48,138 --> 00:14:50,073
Give me that.

211
00:14:51,341 --> 00:14:52,943
It doesn't work.

212
00:14:52,976 --> 00:14:55,946
-Sang Wook hyung is a style that can't complete things in one shot, huh? -This is...

213
00:14:55,979 --> 00:14:58,548
-You need to double tap is Sang Wook. -HAHAHAHAHA!

214
00:14:58,548 --> 00:15:01,051
I should warn you, Ji Hyo is suppressing herself.

215
00:15:01,117 --> 00:15:02,319
Oh, she is?

216
00:15:02,419 --> 00:15:03,854
You have to double...

217
00:15:05,222 --> 00:15:06,623
"Please click twice".

218
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:08,458
Oh, Ji Hyo you were watching.

219
00:15:14,297 --> 00:15:18,335
-You have to double click, I see. -Ji Hyo, you're being unusually patient today.

220
00:15:19,369 --> 00:15:21,905
Usually by now Ji Hyo would be after you hair.

221
00:15:21,938 --> 00:15:25,742
If it was me or Gwang Soo in your position she would be cursing street-style

222
00:15:25,775 --> 00:15:27,444
Ji Hyo's being very patient.

223
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:31,982
-Your age would be...? -I'm a '78

224
00:15:32,048 --> 00:15:34,217
Your expression...

225
00:15:34,251 --> 00:15:37,053
-She's getting annoyed. -If you had been younger than her...

226
00:15:37,988 --> 00:15:41,324
-It's a bit... -Hyung, you look really young for your age.

227
00:15:49,299 --> 00:15:51,101
-Are we the first ones here? -Do we just go in?

228
00:15:51,201 --> 00:15:52,903
-Are we? First?

229
00:15:52,969 --> 00:15:57,107
Hello.

230
00:15:57,173 --> 00:16:01,044
-Here is your mission. -So there is a mission.

231
00:16:01,144 --> 00:16:05,682
-If we don't pass the mission, we can't eat? -Yes.

232
00:16:05,749 --> 00:16:09,619
Place the shellfish over the fire and open all of them within 2 minutes to succeed. What does that mean?

233
00:16:09,686 --> 00:16:11,655
-Oh I remember this! -What is it?

234
00:16:11,688 --> 00:16:13,690
You can't open them by hand.

235
00:16:13,757 --> 00:16:16,559
-Didn't you do this before in Family Outing? -Why yes I did!

236
00:16:16,626 --> 00:16:20,764
-It's opening! It's opening! -Wow! Wow!

237
00:16:20,797 --> 00:16:23,199
Please!

238
00:16:23,266 --> 00:16:24,467
Please! please!

239
00:16:24,501 --> 00:16:26,436
Wait! It's opening! It's opening!

240
00:16:29,472 --> 00:16:30,807
The important thing here is...

241
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,609
How fast you can fan it.

242
00:16:32,676 --> 00:16:34,311
-We need to work hard. -You need speed?

243
00:16:34,411 --> 00:16:37,380
-You need as much heat as possible. -Oh, is that so?

244
00:16:37,447 --> 00:16:41,017
-We have to find something to fan it with. -This hyung is so smart!

245
00:16:41,084 --> 00:16:44,054
-He's the smartest person I've ever seen. -Find a fan, you say?

246
00:16:45,722 --> 00:16:48,491
-Look he's already found one! Wow. -Here's one.

247
00:16:48,525 --> 00:16:49,125
Here, for you, IU.

248
00:16:50,026 --> 00:16:51,428
Thank you.

249
00:16:51,428 --> 00:16:53,863
Because everyone has to succeed, remember.

250
00:16:57,968 --> 00:17:00,637
Hyung does this really make it open?

251
00:17:00,704 --> 00:17:03,406
This makes the fire really heat up.

252
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,141
Two minutes?

253
00:17:05,208 --> 00:17:06,710
This doesn't look easy.

254
00:17:06,776 --> 00:17:09,746
-So if it stays shut we don't get any oyster? -Yes.

255
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:11,348
That's so sad.

256
00:17:11,414 --> 00:17:12,549
Oh dear.

257
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:16,453
Are you ready? Three, two, one, go!

258
00:17:16,519 --> 00:17:19,222
Three, two, one, go!

259
00:17:29,899 --> 00:17:32,669
Is this possible?

260
00:17:32,736 --> 00:17:35,338
-Does this actually work? -Are you sure this is the only way?

261
00:17:36,506 --> 00:17:38,742
I don't think it'll work.

262
00:17:42,178 --> 00:17:44,414
Even if just one opens...

263
00:17:46,249 --> 00:17:49,185
It’s not even getting hot.

264
00:17:49,219 --> 00:17:52,455
When it's about to water it will start leaking.

265
00:17:52,555 --> 00:17:54,324
Hyung it's as dry as it can be though.

266
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:59,262
-To succeed here...! -I just heard something inside!

267
00:17:59,329 --> 00:18:01,698
Look! Hyung, yours is moving.

268
00:18:01,765 --> 00:18:02,966
Really?

269
00:18:03,033 --> 00:18:05,935
I don't believe this!

270
00:18:07,303 --> 00:18:08,638
Please!

271
00:18:08,705 --> 00:18:10,807
-This is really hard. -Time's up.

272
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:14,444
You have to try again using new shellfish.

273
00:18:14,511 --> 00:18:17,580
What a sight!

274
00:18:17,647 --> 00:18:20,450
-It's like eating fish straight from the rod to the kitchen. -Exactly.

275
00:18:21,351 --> 00:18:23,286
-It's already set up. -Good morning.

276
00:18:23,386 --> 00:18:25,488
Looks delicious.

277
00:18:25,555 --> 00:18:27,991
-But I bet there's a mission. -There'll be something for sure.

278
00:18:33,096 --> 00:18:35,098
Oh, this is the menu?

279
00:18:35,165 --> 00:18:39,169
Everyone Correct Quzi. Listen to the qusetion and when each person answers, everyone must answer correctly to succeed.

280
00:18:39,235 --> 00:18:41,004
I see.

281
00:18:41,337 --> 00:18:43,273
-When can we eat? -Correct, correct, correct, correct to win.

282
00:18:43,339 --> 00:18:45,075
Then can we eat?

283
00:18:45,141 --> 00:18:46,676
We can't eat before then?

284
00:18:52,048 --> 00:18:55,585
-Should we go start with Gary first -This way you'll be blamed, Gary.

285
00:18:55,652 --> 00:18:56,419
I understand.

286
00:18:56,486 --> 00:18:58,721
-Here is the first question. -Yes.

287
00:18:58,755 --> 00:19:03,526
What is the Chinese idiom meaning "The fish's head tastes best"?

288
00:19:03,593 --> 00:19:05,528
-Gary, you know this right? -Of course he does, right?

289
00:19:05,562 --> 00:19:07,263
-Everyone knows this, right? -...Fish Head Cut Tall.

290
00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:08,398
What?!

291
00:19:08,465 --> 00:19:09,833
-Everyone knows this, right? -...Fish Head Cut Tall.

292
00:19:09,899 --> 00:19:13,269
What did you say?

293
00:19:13,336 --> 00:19:16,306
-It's not Fish Head Cut Tall? -It's Cut Taste.

294
00:19:16,372 --> 00:19:18,174
We'll try Ji Jin Hee first then

295
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:19,042
-Starting with this hyung. -An easy one please.

296
00:19:19,109 --> 00:19:21,444
-There are a lot of different types of sashimi. -Yes.

297
00:19:21,511 --> 00:19:24,047
What do  you call sashimi that is slightly cooked?

298
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,882
-Do you know it? -I can't remember!

299
00:19:25,949 --> 00:19:28,251
-What was it...? Tuna... -It's that.

300
00:19:28,318 --> 00:19:29,352
Shabu-shabu!

301
00:19:29,419 --> 00:19:32,755
Does it come prepared or do you stick it in something right before you eat it?

302
00:19:32,789 --> 00:19:34,457
You laughed. Shabu-shabu!

303
00:19:34,524 --> 00:19:36,192
It's not?!

304
00:19:36,292 --> 00:19:40,697
-He whispered it to me. -Shabu-shabu? Really?

305
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:43,066
-Shabu-shabu is when you have meat! -I'm sorry.

306
00:19:43,133 --> 00:19:44,767
The answer was Suk Hwe

307
00:19:44,834 --> 00:19:49,339
Suk Hwe, of course.

308
00:19:49,405 --> 00:19:53,476
My stomach is growing.

309
00:20:04,988 --> 00:20:05,955
It's here, it's here.

310
00:20:05,989 --> 00:20:06,856
On the right.

311
00:20:06,923 --> 00:20:09,159
Oh! It's here!

312
00:20:13,196 --> 00:20:15,131
Ah, really.

313
00:20:15,165 --> 00:20:17,200
-This part will be aired no matter what. -You've worked hard.

314
00:20:17,267 --> 00:20:19,102
This part will be aired no matter what!

315
00:20:19,135 --> 00:20:21,204
"It's here", this part will definitely be aired!

316
00:20:21,237 --> 00:20:21,838
Let's alight.

317
00:20:22,805 --> 00:20:27,577
Furnish the dining tabale following the one you just saw. If it's placed exactly the same, you will succeed.

318
00:20:33,683 --> 00:20:35,718
I can't see.

319
00:20:40,023 --> 00:20:41,324
Ah, I don't know.

320
00:20:47,096 --> 00:20:49,666
The colors are about the same.

321
00:20:49,732 --> 00:20:51,167
Hyung, pass it to me first.

322
00:20:51,534 --> 00:20:52,535
-That one. Pass me that one. -First, memory...

323
00:20:52,569 --> 00:20:54,904
First, this one is here.

324
00:20:54,971 --> 00:20:58,441
-Do you know what is below this? -Vinegar and spicy paste is here.

325
00:20:58,508 --> 00:21:01,411
-Sesame oil is here. -Ji Hyo, where are the bean sprouts?

326
00:21:01,477 --> 00:21:04,614
-I've forgetten everything very quickly. -I've also forgotten where the bean sprouts should be.

327
00:21:04,681 --> 00:21:05,582
Bean sprouts are here.

328
00:21:08,818 --> 00:21:11,354
How many chances do we have? Does it end if we get it wrong just once?

329
00:21:11,421 --> 00:21:13,256
Chances, as everybody knows...

330
00:21:13,289 --> 00:21:14,724
-Until you get it correct. -Right.

331
00:21:21,531 --> 00:21:24,534
Ah really! In front of this food, my stomach is ...

332
00:21:24,601 --> 00:21:27,036
-I'm almost going crazy, really. -Really going crazy.

333
00:21:27,103 --> 00:21:30,707
-This is really making me go crazy. -Really going crazy.

334
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:33,576
Ok! It’s done.

335
00:21:35,078 --> 00:21:36,779
What? Wait a moment...

336
00:21:36,813 --> 00:21:39,249
Wait a moment! What are you doing?

337
00:21:39,315 --> 00:21:41,851
-What are you doing Sang Wook? -No, I think it's right.

338
00:21:41,884 --> 00:21:43,820
Np, no, no. Wait awhile.

339
00:21:43,886 --> 00:21:46,589
If it weren't for Ji Hyo, I also almost wanted to just see it again.

340
00:21:46,623 --> 00:21:48,291
Wait, wait. When we see it from here.

341
00:21:48,358 --> 00:21:53,062
The dishes here are roughly...

342
00:21:54,097 --> 00:21:55,465
Please open it!

343
00:21:55,565 --> 00:21:57,367
What will happen if we open it?

344
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,936
-If you open it, we will add one more dish. -That's much better.

345
00:22:01,271 --> 00:22:04,674
-What is much better? -Adding one more! If we create a plan of action...

346
00:22:04,774 --> 00:22:07,477
Then the top part, you take the middle, and I take the bottom part.

347
00:22:07,543 --> 00:22:09,746
Yes, let's do that. I will look at this part.

348
00:22:09,779 --> 00:22:11,481
-Let's look! -Let's look!

349
00:22:11,547 --> 00:22:14,250
Look carefully, how to lay it.

350
00:22:14,317 --> 00:22:15,585
Yes.

351
00:22:15,652 --> 00:22:19,756
Lettuce, this, that...

352
00:22:20,823 --> 00:22:25,595
Radish, radish, spinach...

353
00:22:25,662 --> 00:22:28,831
-This is the new dish. -Yes.

354
00:22:30,366 --> 00:22:33,036
-We didn't see this. -Do we place this anywhere we please?

355
00:22:33,069 --> 00:22:34,704
We had already placed this in just below.

356
00:22:35,571 --> 00:22:36,773
Oh, really?

357
00:22:37,106 --> 00:22:39,475
-It's really hard. -where should this be?

358
00:22:39,542 --> 00:22:41,110
-Ah! I've forgetten it really quickly! -No, no...

359
00:22:41,177 --> 00:22:45,148
-Lotus root. -Pass me that! Pass me that.

360
00:22:45,214 --> 00:22:46,482
Ji Hyo, pass me that.

361
00:22:46,549 --> 00:22:47,984
Like this, like this.

362
00:22:48,051 --> 00:22:49,585
Just like this.

363
00:22:49,619 --> 00:22:51,988
It's roughly this feeling.

364
00:22:54,524 --> 00:22:55,458
Oh, it's roughly like this.

365
00:22:55,458 --> 00:22:57,226
It seems like it’s correct?

366
00:22:59,295 --> 00:23:01,097
Our strategy was right.

367
00:23:04,534 --> 00:23:05,768
I'm going crazy.

368
00:23:07,236 --> 00:23:09,272
Oh! The water is coming out!

369
00:23:10,707 --> 00:23:14,544
There is water coming out! There is water coming out!

370
00:23:21,217 --> 00:23:22,652
We can do it!

371
00:23:22,719 --> 00:23:24,587
You have failed!

372
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:27,590
Very good!

373
00:23:27,657 --> 00:23:29,325
Gwang Soo! Keep it up!

374
00:23:29,392 --> 00:23:30,727
Hyung, I'm tired.

375
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:32,362
Gwang Soo, go for it! Persist!

376
00:23:32,395 --> 00:23:33,763
It's too tiring!

377
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:40,737
We can do it! For IU's sake!

378
00:23:40,737 --> 00:23:44,640
Now I'll give the second question.

379
00:23:44,674 --> 00:23:49,545
In the tv series "Jewel in the Palace", what is the position of the character who is acted by Ji Jin Hee?

380
00:23:49,612 --> 00:23:51,481
-Of course I know this. -Oh!Thank goodness, thank goodness!

381
00:23:51,514 --> 00:23:53,216
King.

382
00:23:53,282 --> 00:23:54,751
King.

383
00:23:54,817 --> 00:23:56,018
Ahhh!!

384
00:23:56,085 --> 00:23:58,955
Are you kidding? How can it be "King"?

385
00:23:59,689 --> 00:24:01,224
He was on a horse all day!

386
00:24:01,257 --> 00:24:02,692
He rode a horse and ...

387
00:24:02,759 --> 00:24:06,195
In the year 2012,what sign of the zodiac will the babies be born under?

388
00:24:06,262 --> 00:24:08,164
-Snake! -No, no!

389
00:24:08,264 --> 00:24:11,501
-It's dragon,born in the year of the dragon -It's not ?

390
00:24:15,037 --> 00:24:17,573
This is ...

391
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,642
This position is correct .

392
00:24:19,675 --> 00:24:22,945
This position is the correct one .

393
00:24:22,979 --> 00:24:23,846
Correct?

394
00:24:23,913 --> 00:24:25,982
Oh, this and that were  interchanged?

395
00:24:26,883 --> 00:24:27,750
What is this ?

396
00:24:27,784 --> 00:24:31,120
-Now what are you doing? -Really, what are you doing?

397
00:24:31,187 --> 00:24:32,288
This is also not correct?

398
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:34,957
Let's take a look.

399
00:24:35,024 --> 00:24:36,526
We have to look again. We have to look again.

400
00:24:40,296 --> 00:24:43,566
-On top... dongchimi, spinach, lotus root. -Is that kimchi?

401
00:24:43,633 --> 00:24:44,500
Dongchimi, spinach, lotus root.

402
00:24:44,667 --> 00:24:46,002
Kimchi, doenjang...

403
00:24:46,068 --> 00:24:47,470
-Kimchi, doenjang... -OK!

404
00:24:47,537 --> 00:24:49,405
Kimchi...

405
00:24:49,505 --> 00:24:50,940
Doenjang.

406
00:24:51,007 --> 00:24:55,545
Dongchimi, spinach, lotus root.

407
00:24:55,611 --> 00:24:56,245
Yours is gatkimchi.

408
00:24:56,312 --> 00:24:58,281
-Also.. -The gatkimchi was here.

409
00:24:59,382 --> 00:25:00,516
The newly added bean sprouts is here.

410
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:02,318
-Where is the gochujang? -Oh!Yes, bean sprouts!

411
00:25:02,351 --> 00:25:04,720
Here, here.

412
00:25:05,955 --> 00:25:07,056
Ok! We're done!

413
00:25:07,123 --> 00:25:07,657
Done!

414
00:25:07,657 --> 00:25:10,326
1, 2, 3, challenge!

415
00:25:21,771 --> 00:25:22,839
Now we can eat!

416
00:25:22,872 --> 00:25:23,406
Really...

417
00:25:23,473 --> 00:25:25,041
Oppa, let's start eating!

418
00:25:25,074 --> 00:25:27,076
-Ji Hyo, let's eat now. Quick, let's start eating.

419
00:25:27,109 --> 00:25:27,910
This is really so tiring.

420
00:25:27,977 --> 00:25:31,647
In here, according to one's tastes...

421
00:25:38,321 --> 00:25:40,389
It's really delicious!

422
00:25:44,694 --> 00:25:45,962
With some lettuce...

423
00:25:59,675 --> 00:26:01,644
It's almost done, It's almost done!

424
00:26:03,012 --> 00:26:06,282
The one whose clam opens first, do help the people beside you after that, got it?

425
00:26:06,315 --> 00:26:06,916
OK.

426
00:26:09,252 --> 00:26:10,386
Oh, algoo!

427
00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:15,157
It opened, it opened!

428
00:26:21,864 --> 00:26:24,967
We shouldn't have came here. Shouldn't have...

429
00:26:25,001 --> 00:26:27,570
There's no one here. We shouldn't have come.

430
00:26:27,637 --> 00:26:29,839
It's opening!

431
00:26:29,939 --> 00:26:30,506
It's opening! It's opening!

432
00:26:30,573 --> 00:26:32,108
Go for it! Go for it!

433
00:26:33,042 --> 00:26:34,210
Oh! There's water!

434
00:26:42,318 --> 00:26:45,221
It's opening! It's opening!

435
00:26:46,355 --> 00:26:48,224
Chun Hee's clam, Chun Hee's clam...

436
00:26:48,291 --> 00:26:50,326
Faster, help Chun Hee. Help Chun Hee's!

437
00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:52,061
Chun Hee's clam still needs fanning.

438
00:26:58,267 --> 00:27:00,303
The clam is scorched why is it not opening?

439
00:27:05,608 --> 00:27:07,343
It's opening! It's opening!

440
00:27:11,213 --> 00:27:15,151
It's opened! It's opened!

441
00:27:21,757 --> 00:27:23,092
Good, pass!

442
00:27:28,631 --> 00:27:29,865
Hyung, these are all well cooked.

443
00:27:29,899 --> 00:27:31,467
It's too delicious!

444
00:27:31,534 --> 00:27:33,102
This is no joke.

445
00:27:33,135 --> 00:27:35,338
This oyster, when eaten together with kimchi, tastes especially great.

446
00:27:46,115 --> 00:27:48,317
-It's too delicious! -It's really good.

447
00:27:52,455 --> 00:27:54,924
Ah, freshly cut sea bass.

448
00:27:56,025 --> 00:27:57,927
People say the fish head is the most delicious. It really is!

449
00:28:14,577 --> 00:28:17,546
Although it was really hard work,

450
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:20,416
But the most important thing is where to go for our next destination?

451
00:28:20,449 --> 00:28:21,784
That's right, we have a lot of choices now.

452
00:28:21,817 --> 00:28:23,219
What shall we eat?

453
00:28:23,285 --> 00:28:25,755
Ah, I really want to try everything here.

454
00:28:25,821 --> 00:28:27,156
IU, what do you want to eat?

455
00:28:27,156 --> 00:28:28,424
I would like...

456
00:28:28,457 --> 00:28:29,158
Seasoned crab!

457
00:28:29,225 --> 00:28:30,326
I really feel like eating seasoned crabs.

458
00:28:30,393 --> 00:28:32,228
Do you like crabs marinated in soy sauce or spicy seasoned raw crabs?

459
00:28:32,261 --> 00:28:34,363
-We'll say it together at the count of three! -1, 2, 3.

460
00:28:34,397 --> 00:28:35,765
Crabs marinated in soy sauce!

461
00:28:39,702 --> 00:28:40,236
Crabs marinated in soy sauce!

462
00:28:40,269 --> 00:28:42,571
I totally love crabs marinated in soy sauce!

463
00:28:42,605 --> 00:28:44,707
Crabs marinated in soy sauce are delicious.

464
00:28:46,108 --> 00:28:47,810
We will be reaching very soon.

465
00:28:52,882 --> 00:28:54,684
Hello.

466
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:59,088
Hey! What is that?

467
00:29:05,961 --> 00:29:07,730
Flip the crab shells placed on the tray

468
00:29:07,797 --> 00:29:10,666
Every member must succeed in flipping it over once to succeed.

469
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:11,634
You have 5 chances.

470
00:29:11,667 --> 00:29:12,568
Oh?

471
00:29:12,601 --> 00:29:13,803
It's a little hard.

472
00:29:13,836 --> 00:29:15,571
-Start from you. -Start from you.

473
00:29:15,604 --> 00:29:16,806
Fighting!

474
00:29:16,839 --> 00:29:18,040
Fighting! Fighting!

475
00:29:19,675 --> 00:29:20,609
There's no problem.

476
00:29:20,643 --> 00:29:21,877
Doing two is possible.

477
00:29:36,192 --> 00:29:38,761
Actually if you listen to his voice, you will think he can do everything well.

478
00:29:40,029 --> 00:29:44,300
Hahahahahahaha. Something like this, Hahahahahahaha.

479
00:29:44,366 --> 00:29:45,367
This is nothing.

480
00:29:45,434 --> 00:29:46,168
1, 2...

481
00:29:56,746 --> 00:29:58,347
It turned one complete round exactly.

482
00:29:58,380 --> 00:29:59,915
-Sang Wook, what are you doing? -Didn't you see?

483
00:29:59,949 --> 00:30:03,385
-Is it that funny? -How can they both make one complete turn?

484
00:30:03,419 --> 00:30:06,355
Ah, can you please do it properly?

485
00:30:06,388 --> 00:30:08,624
Really, this person is so frustrating!

486
00:30:08,691 --> 00:30:12,294
This person is so frustrating.

487
00:30:12,294 --> 00:30:14,263
Sang Wook, come and stand here.

488
00:30:14,296 --> 00:30:15,631
Please give us some water.

489
00:30:15,664 --> 00:30:17,466
This is really funny.

490
00:30:17,566 --> 00:30:18,200
This person is so frustrating.

491
00:30:18,234 --> 00:30:20,336
Let's start from Ji Hyo this time -Let Ji Hyo start.

492
00:30:20,369 --> 00:30:22,138
Ji Hyo, you will succeed.

493
00:30:22,171 --> 00:30:23,973
Don't be nervous.

494
00:30:26,609 --> 00:30:28,711
Done! Ji Hyo, good job!

495
00:30:30,913 --> 00:30:32,848
Done! Ji Hyo, good job! Well done!

496
00:30:32,915 --> 00:30:36,752
Ji Hyo, good job! Well done!

497
00:30:36,786 --> 00:30:38,387
Ji Hyo did quite well.

498
00:30:48,197 --> 00:30:49,498
What? What?

499
00:30:49,532 --> 00:30:51,000
You’ll do it last.

500
00:30:53,702 --> 00:30:55,571
Ji Hyo finally succeeded. How could you...

501
00:30:55,638 --> 00:30:57,907
Both of you wasted two chances!

502
00:30:57,973 --> 00:31:00,009
Be more serious!

503
00:31:05,848 --> 00:31:08,784
-Hyung!Are you all done? -Oh! They are here!

504
00:31:08,818 --> 00:31:10,419
It's IU, IU!

505
00:31:15,791 --> 00:31:18,460
Ah!They are all IU’s manager!

506
00:31:18,527 --> 00:31:21,897
I am the president. He is the hair stylist.

507
00:31:21,964 --> 00:31:23,566
Hair designer!

508
00:31:23,632 --> 00:31:24,767
Chun Hee is the on-set manager.

509
00:31:24,834 --> 00:31:27,703
But the president's outfit is quite cute.

510
00:31:30,039 --> 00:31:32,208
Let the Yellow Team take a look at the mission first.

511
00:31:32,274 --> 00:31:36,078
All the members must flip the crab shells on the tray over to succeed!

512
00:31:36,111 --> 00:31:37,546
You are left with two chances.

513
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:39,548
Do we have to flip it over at the same time?

514
00:31:41,317 --> 00:31:42,084
The last chance.

515
00:31:42,151 --> 00:31:45,387
Be confident! Be confident! Be confident!

516
00:31:45,421 --> 00:31:47,590
Anyway, the Yellow Team definitely wouldn't do well.

517
00:31:47,623 --> 00:31:49,491
1, 2, 3. Fighting!

518
00:31:52,795 --> 00:31:56,465
But if it's like that...

519
00:31:57,299 --> 00:32:00,169
Just do what you need to do!

520
00:32:04,673 --> 00:32:08,110
Today's ending will be Ave Ji Hyo pulling Sang Wook hyung's hair.

521
00:32:10,045 --> 00:32:12,414
1, 2.

522
00:32:17,553 --> 00:32:20,456
That hyung really can't do anything well.

523
00:32:20,489 --> 00:32:22,491
Yeah, what you said is ture.

524
00:32:22,558 --> 00:32:25,461
This is actually quite a feat. I did the same thing twice.

525
00:32:26,595 --> 00:32:28,831
It was the same just now.

526
00:32:28,898 --> 00:32:31,934
No matter what, it is a fail, It is the Yellow Team's turn now.

527
00:32:32,001 --> 00:32:35,137
-It will only be your turn after they fail. -Ah, so we failed for this turn.

528
00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:36,872
-So we can sitll continue during the next turn. That's good.

529
00:32:36,939 --> 00:32:38,374
Let's laugh at them together.

530
00:32:40,075 --> 00:32:42,645
Let me explain it to everyone. There are 5 tires...

531
00:32:44,313 --> 00:32:46,548
It doesn't matter if it is placed like this or the other way...

532
00:32:46,615 --> 00:32:49,118
But you will have to flip it onto the other side to succeed.

533
00:32:49,151 --> 00:32:51,520
Then the next person takes turn. When all 4 members succeed, the mission is successful.

534
00:32:51,587 --> 00:32:54,924
Try laughing,try laughing.

535
00:33:03,732 --> 00:33:06,502
-He is really good. -His stomach contains speakers, speakers.

536
00:33:11,106 --> 00:33:11,907
Chanllenge!

537
00:33:11,974 --> 00:33:13,742
We will succeed.

538
00:33:13,776 --> 00:33:16,078
Let’s get ready to laugh at them!

539
00:33:17,179 --> 00:33:19,181
Place them more towards the front.

540
00:33:19,248 --> 00:33:21,450
Hyung there is no use saying it so just do it.

541
00:33:26,922 --> 00:33:30,326
Doing that is useless.

542
00:33:30,359 --> 00:33:32,528
You failed. For the first try, it's a fail.

543
00:33:32,594 --> 00:33:35,464
It will be very awkward if this try fails.

544
00:33:36,298 --> 00:33:37,066
You can do it.

545
00:33:37,099 --> 00:33:41,103
-IU~ -Ah, don't do that.

546
00:33:43,639 --> 00:33:46,442
This is quite awkward for you.

547
00:33:55,384 --> 00:33:59,321
It is impossible to succeed, really.

548
00:34:00,322 --> 00:34:01,924
1,2,3. Fighting!

549
00:34:02,057 --> 00:34:03,659
I heard there is a team that is leading by a lot.

550
00:34:03,726 --> 00:34:05,027
Oh, really?

551
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:07,429
So we will now remove one shell.

552
00:34:08,664 --> 00:34:10,299
It will be too easy if there is only 1 shell.

553
00:34:10,366 --> 00:34:12,434
-We need to control the strength used as well. -Yes.

554
00:34:17,006 --> 00:34:19,208
Ah... jeez!

555
00:34:19,274 --> 00:34:21,377
Let's me start thsi time.

556
00:34:21,477 --> 00:34:22,845
Go to the back!

557
00:34:23,846 --> 00:34:25,247
I’m going crazy.

558
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:29,518
I'm really going crazy.

559
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:32,788
-Let's do the cheer again. -Come. let's cheer.

560
00:34:32,855 --> 00:34:34,289
No, no, excluding him.

561
00:34:35,858 --> 00:34:38,260
He has to do some srtious reflection.

562
00:34:38,293 --> 00:34:40,562
1,2,3. Fighting!

563
00:34:41,930 --> 00:34:43,198
You try not doing it well .

564
00:34:43,265 --> 00:34:45,167
I will get back at you.

565
00:34:47,836 --> 00:34:50,439
Come over here. Oh!

566
00:34:50,506 --> 00:34:54,043
Come over here. Oh! Sorry.

567
00:34:54,076 --> 00:34:55,411
I get the trick.

568
00:34:58,313 --> 00:35:00,582
That's it. Well done.

569
00:35:01,817 --> 00:35:04,286
Come, Joo Sang Wook! Joo Sang Wook!

570
00:35:04,353 --> 00:35:06,789
Sang Wook, do it well!

571
00:35:06,822 --> 00:35:08,824
Don’t try to be funny! Don’t try to be funny!

572
00:35:08,857 --> 00:35:11,393
I had never once tried to be funny!

573
00:35:12,261 --> 00:35:12,895
I am doing it very seriously.

574
00:35:12,928 --> 00:35:14,430
This is a game, game!

575
00:35:14,463 --> 00:35:16,565
The crab is looking at you, right now. You have to do it well.

576
00:35:16,632 --> 00:35:18,200
Ji Hyo...

577
00:35:18,233 --> 00:35:20,869
You have to look at it closely.

578
00:35:29,111 --> 00:35:30,112
Look at it closely.

579
00:35:30,179 --> 00:35:33,082
1,2,3.

580
00:35:41,990 --> 00:35:43,559
Sang Wook, you did it.

581
00:35:44,693 --> 00:35:46,195
We are only left with HaHa.

582
00:35:46,261 --> 00:35:48,997
-HaHa, we are believing in you. -HaHa, don't feel too burdened.

583
00:35:49,098 --> 00:35:51,467
HaHa, don't feel too burdened, don't feel too burdened.

584
00:35:51,533 --> 00:35:53,135
Hyung was joking with you just now.

585
00:35:53,168 --> 00:35:54,970
I am really going crazy.

586
00:35:58,373 --> 00:35:59,675
HaHa, you can definitely succeed. You can do it!

587
00:36:14,156 --> 00:36:16,458
The one who controls time!

588
00:36:16,525 --> 00:36:19,061
The one who controls time!

589
00:36:23,232 --> 00:36:26,135
I'm sorry, I'm really sorry.

590
00:36:30,806 --> 00:36:35,043
What are you doing? Even Sang Wook succeeded.

591
00:36:35,077 --> 00:36:37,112
Let me complete it 1, 2, 3.

592
00:36:44,686 --> 00:36:46,121
What are you good at?

593
00:36:48,190 --> 00:36:49,124
What is this?

594
00:36:49,191 --> 00:36:51,627
Ji Hyo, calm down!

595
00:36:53,195 --> 00:36:55,297
This child is quite kind. Come over.

596
00:36:57,733 --> 00:36:59,034
Come, challenge!

597
00:37:03,605 --> 00:37:06,508
I didn't want to, but I have to take it off.

598
00:37:06,608 --> 00:37:08,377
Giraffe!

599
00:37:12,147 --> 00:37:15,751
This hyung really looks less inposing with the vibrant color.

600
00:37:23,959 --> 00:37:26,428
HaHa, don't fell burdened.

601
00:37:34,937 --> 00:37:35,637
Good!

602
00:37:35,704 --> 00:37:38,006
Ah, bravo!

603
00:37:40,576 --> 00:37:43,312
This hyung's voice is like drama tone.

604
00:37:43,378 --> 00:37:46,949
I don't usually gets nervous easily.

605
00:37:51,186 --> 00:37:51,920
Lightly, lightly.

606
00:37:51,987 --> 00:37:53,555
1,2,3.

607
00:38:07,636 --> 00:38:10,439
Laugh, laugh!

608
00:38:17,346 --> 00:38:18,247
The team that succeeded can enjoy the meal now.

609
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,514
Ah, thanks.

610
00:38:19,548 --> 00:38:22,217
I will just do it quickly.

611
00:38:22,284 --> 00:38:26,188
You are too fast!

612
00:38:27,289 --> 00:38:29,024
You did it! You did it!

613
00:38:29,091 --> 00:38:31,460
He already did it twice.

614
00:38:33,929 --> 00:38:37,366
Hyung, you can do it!

615
00:38:47,409 --> 00:38:50,545
The last one.

616
00:38:50,579 --> 00:38:51,446
1,2,3.

617
00:39:07,863 --> 00:39:10,098
Ah, this restaurant serves really delicious food.

618
00:39:12,067 --> 00:39:15,804
Ah, really, I'm about to go mad. It's too delicious!

619
00:39:20,942 --> 00:39:23,845
The bingo grid shouldn't be 3 by 3.

620
00:39:23,879 --> 00:39:26,348
It should be something like 10 by 10...

621
00:39:40,462 --> 00:39:43,298
-Everyone enjoy your meal! -Be careful on your way!

622
00:39:43,332 --> 00:39:45,067
Ah, it is really funny.

623
00:39:45,067 --> 00:39:47,069
The father and daughter with two giraffes.

624
00:39:58,246 --> 00:39:59,781
-We're here. -it smells nice.

625
00:39:59,848 --> 00:40:01,216
Hello!

626
00:40:01,249 --> 00:40:03,985
-Nice to meet you! -Hello, everyone!

627
00:40:04,052 --> 00:40:08,056
After listening to the question,answer using 'O' and 'X'. If all of the members answer it correctly, you succeed!

628
00:40:17,132 --> 00:40:19,968
-Ah, this is easy. -It's really difficult!

629
00:40:20,001 --> 00:40:24,139
Answer the quiz correctly twice in a row to succeed.

630
00:40:24,172 --> 00:40:29,144
The first question. Red bean soup is eaten on Winter Solstice.

631
00:40:29,177 --> 00:40:32,013
Is Winter Solstice the coldest day of the year?

632
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:34,149
1,2,3.

633
00:40:38,987 --> 00:40:41,757
No matter what, you failed the quiz.

634
00:40:41,757 --> 00:40:43,425
What is the correct answer?

635
00:40:43,458 --> 00:40:45,093
The correct answer is X.

636
00:40:45,127 --> 00:40:46,061
Of course.

637
00:40:46,161 --> 00:40:48,163
Ah, so this is correct?

638
00:40:48,196 --> 00:40:49,498
I was looking at it like that.

639
00:40:49,531 --> 00:40:53,001
-Ah, oppa, you should have done it properly! -I thought I have to look at X like this.

640
00:40:53,068 --> 00:40:54,803
Anyway it is the fist try.

641
00:40:54,836 --> 00:40:57,205
Ji Hyo, HaHa, do your best.

642
00:40:57,272 --> 00:40:59,775
What is the correct answer? Please say it again. -Winter Solsticeis is the ...

643
00:40:59,808 --> 00:41:01,910
the 2nd coldest day of the year.

644
00:41:05,213 --> 00:41:07,349
Look, comrade Ha.

645
00:41:08,250 --> 00:41:09,751
Comrade Ha.

646
00:41:09,818 --> 00:41:11,153
Ah, comrade Yoo!

647
00:41:11,186 --> 00:41:12,587
Hello to all my comrades!

648
00:41:12,621 --> 00:41:15,557
Ah, really. It's alright, let's try again.

649
00:41:15,590 --> 00:41:17,559
Can hyung tell me what is Winter Solstice?

650
00:41:17,626 --> 00:41:21,830
I am curious about the next qusetion. Let's just forget this.

651
00:41:24,132 --> 00:41:25,834
Come on and tell us.

652
00:41:25,867 --> 00:41:27,569
It is not that I don't know.

653
00:41:30,105 --> 00:41:33,575
Was the 'Diary in War' written by Admiral Yi Sun one month before the war?

654
00:41:36,645 --> 00:41:38,113
1,2,3.

655
00:41:43,552 --> 00:41:46,655
The correct answer is O.

656
00:41:49,991 --> 00:41:52,627
That is why the 'Diary in War' is famous!

657
00:41:52,694 --> 00:41:55,430
Right, I think I saw an article before, so...

658
00:41:58,166 --> 00:42:01,436
The way I see it, you are good at guessing.

659
00:42:01,503 --> 00:42:04,206
Really, you are good at guessing.

660
00:42:04,239 --> 00:42:05,974
If this goes on, will we run out of questions?

661
00:42:06,007 --> 00:42:08,310
-There 's more than enough. -Is that so?

662
00:42:09,911 --> 00:42:13,982
Is Oh Dongoing island the biggest island in Yeosu?

663
00:42:14,049 --> 00:42:15,383
1,2,3.

664
00:42:18,186 --> 00:42:19,354
Hyung!

665
00:42:19,421 --> 00:42:21,423
Comrade Joo, what are you doing?

666
00:42:21,456 --> 00:42:24,459
-Dong island... -Didn't we go to Oh Dong island before?

667
00:42:24,526 --> 00:42:26,194
It looks small to me?

668
00:42:26,228 --> 00:42:28,597
Eh? Isn't it?

669
00:42:28,663 --> 00:42:30,699
-The correct answer is X! -Ah! Really!

670
00:42:30,732 --> 00:42:32,734
I really can’t work with you guys.

671
00:42:32,767 --> 00:42:36,538
-It's not Oh Dong island? Then what is it? -Tell us, what is it?

672
00:42:36,638 --> 00:42:40,442
I really don’t know about this!

673
00:42:40,475 --> 00:42:42,444
I don't know what is the correct name of the island.

674
00:42:42,511 --> 00:42:45,881
-Sang Wook's ability at guessing is really good! -If the biggest island is not Oh Dong island, then what is it?

675
00:42:45,947 --> 00:42:48,250
What is the biggest island?

676
00:42:48,283 --> 00:42:49,784
The biggest island is Dol San.

677
00:42:49,851 --> 00:42:51,152
Ah, Dol San?

678
00:42:51,219 --> 00:42:52,988
So is that Kat Dol San?

679
00:42:54,456 --> 00:42:56,958
No matter what, you are really good at guessing.

680
00:42:57,025 --> 00:42:58,660
His guesses are really accurate.

681
00:42:58,727 --> 00:43:02,197
He answered all the questions correctly. We'll be fine if we just follow him.

682
00:43:02,230 --> 00:43:05,333
The questions are a little too tough, it is too hard to guess.

683
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:06,535
-We'll give you some eaiser ones. -Yes.

684
00:43:06,568 --> 00:43:08,703
I will give you a question regarding the Running Man members.

685
00:43:08,737 --> 00:43:10,605
Then I am at an disadvantage.

686
00:43:11,506 --> 00:43:14,743
Among the Running Man members is HaHa the shortest member?

687
00:43:14,776 --> 00:43:16,144
1,2,3.

688
00:43:20,882 --> 00:43:22,150
Isn’t it Song Ji Hyo?

689
00:43:23,752 --> 00:43:25,587
Isn’t Ji Hyo a little taller?

690
00:43:26,888 --> 00:43:29,357
I'm over 170 cm.

691
00:43:29,424 --> 00:43:31,593
Ah, alright, we get it. We didn't know.

692
00:43:31,626 --> 00:43:34,663
Ah, that is not an easy question!

693
00:43:34,663 --> 00:43:39,501
You get up and we'll measure. Are you guys joking?

694
00:43:39,568 --> 00:43:40,168
Ji Hyo is a bit taller?

695
00:43:40,235 --> 00:43:42,003
Ah, I'm taller!

696
00:43:42,037 --> 00:43:42,938
HaHa is taller.

697
00:43:42,971 --> 00:43:45,740
It is obvious just by looking at the shoulders!

698
00:43:48,910 --> 00:43:50,845
It is indeed a tough question...

699
00:43:50,912 --> 00:43:53,448
Why is this a tough question?

700
00:43:53,515 --> 00:43:56,184
I am really going crazy.

701
00:43:56,251 --> 00:43:58,887
To us, it is really a very tough question!

702
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:02,457
Although it's unlikely but if this was a question on a high school examination paper,

703
00:44:02,524 --> 00:44:05,727
It will really be the hardest question.

704
00:44:07,896 --> 00:44:11,099
Is an airplane’s Black Box black in color?

705
00:44:11,166 --> 00:44:12,467
1,2,3.

706
00:44:12,534 --> 00:44:14,736
Of course it is!

707
00:44:17,439 --> 00:44:18,907
It is X.

708
00:44:18,974 --> 00:44:20,842
What color is it?

709
00:44:20,875 --> 00:44:22,143
It is orange!

710
00:44:24,913 --> 00:44:28,149
HaHa, think about it. Everyone has experienced this before,

711
00:44:28,183 --> 00:44:32,387
If I choose the opposite of what I think is correct, the result is better.

712
00:44:32,454 --> 00:44:34,689
Get it?

713
00:44:34,723 --> 00:44:36,825
It hurts my pride. I can’t do it!

714
00:44:37,993 --> 00:44:41,162
Does the deer’s antler shed and grow again every  year?

715
00:44:41,196 --> 00:44:43,198
-1,2,3. -Ah, it is too easy!

716
00:44:49,104 --> 00:44:50,705
This level...

717
00:44:50,772 --> 00:44:52,107
I really don’t know...

718
00:44:52,140 --> 00:44:54,309
-How can you not know... -The correct answer is O.

719
00:44:57,812 --> 00:44:59,748
You bunch of fools!

720
00:44:59,781 --> 00:45:03,418
Haven't you been to a Chinese Medicine clinic before?

721
00:45:05,387 --> 00:45:06,788
Sorry, HaHa, Really.

722
00:45:06,821 --> 00:45:09,190
They shed their horns every year.

723
00:45:09,224 --> 00:45:11,493
If not, how do Chinese Medicine clinic get them?

724
00:45:11,559 --> 00:45:12,761
So we have to start all over again?

725
00:45:12,794 --> 00:45:13,495
Yes.

726
00:45:13,561 --> 00:45:15,830
-If we carry on like this all the other teams will finish before us. -Ah, I am really going crazy.

727
00:45:15,897 --> 00:45:19,968
Because the red bean is sweet, it is called 'sweet bean' in English.

728
00:45:21,002 --> 00:45:23,371
We all answered X right?

729
00:45:23,405 --> 00:45:25,206
The answer is X. It is called 'red bean'.

730
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:28,443
Do you need a passport to go to the Antarctica?

731
00:45:28,510 --> 00:45:30,578
X!

732
00:45:30,612 --> 00:45:31,646
The correct answer is X.

733
00:45:31,646 --> 00:45:33,948
-I knew it will be like that. -Enough.

734
00:45:34,015 --> 00:45:36,184
Thank you~

735
00:45:39,888 --> 00:45:40,789
Oppa, how is it?

736
00:45:40,855 --> 00:45:42,457
It's delicious.

737
00:45:42,524 --> 00:45:45,660
This is the taste.

738
00:45:49,931 --> 00:45:53,301
We succeeded at eating the red bean porridge.

739
00:46:00,241 --> 00:46:03,778
Oh! The final mission is appearing!

740
00:46:10,218 --> 00:46:11,786
What is it?

741
00:46:11,820 --> 00:46:15,023
The grids are 4 by 4 with the numbers 1 to 16.

742
00:46:26,067 --> 00:46:27,635
What is the meaning of this final mission?

743
00:46:28,937 --> 00:46:30,405
Oh? What is this?

744
00:46:45,286 --> 00:46:49,357
From now on, we have to wear our jackets.

745
00:46:56,698 --> 00:46:58,433
Oppa, this is a race.

746
00:46:58,466 --> 00:46:59,968
A race?

747
00:47:02,403 --> 00:47:03,671
We have to complete that Bingo.

748
00:47:04,539 --> 00:47:07,208
We have to complete that Bingo?

749
00:47:07,275 --> 00:47:10,578
We have to find these numbers.

750
00:47:10,578 --> 00:47:14,082
Ah! This is quite difficult.

751
00:47:14,149 --> 00:47:17,418
Although we don't know where are the tags from number 13 onwards.

752
00:47:19,487 --> 00:47:23,591
But Suk Jin hyung is number 3 and IU is number 1.

753
00:47:23,658 --> 00:47:25,727
Who is number 5?

754
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:26,961
Me!

755
00:47:27,061 --> 00:47:28,563
Ah! Ji Hyo is number 5.

756
00:47:28,630 --> 00:47:30,865
Then what is our strategy?

757
00:47:34,502 --> 00:47:35,236
First, we have to quickly find the numbers hidden on the island.

758
00:47:35,270 --> 00:47:38,439
-Right, tearing IU's number tag won't be easy. -Because there are a lot of people protecting her.

759
00:47:38,506 --> 00:47:42,610
Anyway, don't we have the preys from the savanna?

760
00:47:42,644 --> 00:47:45,079
Gwang Soo...

761
00:47:45,146 --> 00:47:45,814
Suk Jin hyung...

762
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:46,815
And Chun Hee.

763
00:47:46,848 --> 00:47:50,051
We can immediately surround them and tear off their number tags.

764
00:47:59,727 --> 00:48:01,462
We are setting off!

765
00:48:05,834 --> 00:48:07,735
We are all targeting you.

766
00:48:07,769 --> 00:48:11,906
Gwang Soo! Be careful, Gwang Soo!

767
00:48:12,974 --> 00:48:17,979
No matter what we have to find the numbers first.

768
00:48:18,046 --> 00:48:21,549
We must find the numbers first, before going further.

769
00:48:21,583 --> 00:48:24,819
It is more advantageous for us if we find the numbers hidden on the island first.

770
00:48:24,886 --> 00:48:28,456
Hold on, what are the other numbers that we can get hold of?

771
00:48:28,489 --> 00:48:30,959
What are the numbers that we have?

772
00:48:31,025 --> 00:48:32,727
Who is number 5?

773
00:48:32,794 --> 00:48:34,696
Number 5 is Ji Hyo.

774
00:48:35,630 --> 00:48:37,131
Who is number 9?

775
00:48:37,165 --> 00:48:38,399
Jin Hee hyung.

776
00:48:38,466 --> 00:48:40,335
Jin Hee hyung's difficult.

777
00:48:40,368 --> 00:48:41,202
Who is number 8?

778
00:48:41,269 --> 00:48:43,371
Uncle Jae Suk!

779
00:48:43,404 --> 00:48:45,573
Number 10 is...

780
00:48:46,808 --> 00:48:50,945
Number 10!

781
00:48:50,979 --> 00:48:52,714
Number 10! Definitely number 10.

782
00:48:52,780 --> 00:48:53,414
We are done.

783
00:48:56,351 --> 00:48:58,586
We have to find number 15.

784
00:48:58,620 --> 00:49:02,790
Attack number 10 Gary and number 8 Jae Suk.

785
00:49:03,858 --> 00:49:05,960
Why not we exchange it with them after we find it?

786
00:49:06,027 --> 00:49:07,028
Good.

787
00:49:28,850 --> 00:49:30,285
It's coming it's coming!

788
00:49:34,088 --> 00:49:36,457
But how are we going to find it on such a big island?

789
00:49:36,524 --> 00:49:37,392
Search carefully.

790
00:49:37,458 --> 00:49:39,327
How are we going to search for it on such a big island?

791
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:41,729
Captain! We are going up from there.

792
00:49:57,712 --> 00:50:01,382
-Oh, so cool. -Hey, how exactly do we start searching on such a big island?

793
00:50:04,419 --> 00:50:06,220
Exactly, aren't there any hints?

794
00:50:06,254 --> 00:50:08,523
-We need hints to be able to find it. -We don't need it.

795
00:50:08,556 --> 00:50:11,726
Ok, from now on, we will begin, a race on this island.

796
00:50:11,759 --> 00:50:14,128
There are numbers on this island.

797
00:50:14,195 --> 00:50:17,865
The team that completes their bingo first, gets to leave this island in the fastest and most outrageous way.

798
00:50:19,934 --> 00:50:22,670
Ah, really?

799
00:50:22,770 --> 00:50:26,107
We wouldn’t be taking a helicopter out or anything like that right?

800
00:50:28,276 --> 00:50:31,946
Ah,it's the same as...ah, a submarine !

801
00:50:34,182 --> 00:50:38,987
-First oppa, we, have numbers up till 12 right, we do? -Yes.

802
00:50:39,020 --> 00:50:42,156
-We have to find 13,14,15 and 16. -Now, we have to find them quickly!

803
00:50:42,190 --> 00:50:44,225
-Yes, find them quickly... -To get a bigger advantage.

804
00:50:44,258 --> 00:50:47,161
Ah, greater odds of winning, greater odds of winning.

805
00:50:51,232 --> 00:50:54,902
Hyung, let's hurry before the remaining teams arrive!

806
00:50:54,936 --> 00:50:57,238
Hey, search quickly, let's search.

807
00:50:57,305 --> 00:51:00,174
-Oppa, let's split up! -Split into pairs, search in pairs.

808
00:51:00,241 --> 00:51:01,442
Go!

809
00:51:03,411 --> 00:51:05,747
The village is very pretty.

810
00:51:06,614 --> 00:51:08,683
The village is really pretty.

811
00:51:09,384 --> 00:51:12,420
No, this is hidden rather...

812
00:51:12,487 --> 00:51:14,322
Hey, this is so frustrating.

813
00:51:14,355 --> 00:51:17,425
Is this just hidden somewhere or what?

814
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:21,229
In the past...

815
00:51:22,096 --> 00:51:23,765
When I was in school and had to find something...

816
00:51:24,866 --> 00:51:27,068
I could really find it.

817
00:51:28,903 --> 00:51:33,674
I have to recall, the teachers' thinking.

818
00:51:33,708 --> 00:51:35,943
Where they hid them.

819
00:51:39,247 --> 00:51:41,249
Hey, where do we find this?

820
00:51:45,286 --> 00:51:48,423
Hey, there isn't any, path on that side...

821
00:51:48,489 --> 00:51:50,792
They’re here, they’re here, this is bad.

822
00:51:54,262 --> 00:51:56,998
Why are they running, why run?

823
00:51:57,031 --> 00:51:59,901
-To get, to tear off our numbers. -Do you see them running?

824
00:52:01,035 --> 00:52:03,237
They’re coming to tear off our numbers right?

825
00:52:03,304 --> 00:52:04,605
Ah, it can’t be.

826
00:52:05,740 --> 00:52:07,008
Ok, are you giving using the mission once we’re there?

827
00:52:07,041 --> 00:52:09,143
Eariler, what you receiced eariler was the mission.

828
00:52:09,177 --> 00:52:10,812
Which is to complete your bingo.

829
00:52:10,878 --> 00:52:13,314
No, wherever it's hidden, just find them unconditionally?

830
00:52:13,381 --> 00:52:15,083
-We can go anywhere? -Seriously?

831
00:52:15,149 --> 00:52:17,218
On this island?

832
00:52:17,251 --> 00:52:19,520
Find them unconditionally?

833
00:52:19,587 --> 00:52:21,289
The island, is extremely big?

834
00:52:21,355 --> 00:52:23,691
This isn’t a joke.

835
00:52:33,167 --> 00:52:36,637
So on this island, what's the most famous thing on this island?

836
00:52:36,704 --> 00:52:38,206
That solar panel.

837
00:52:38,239 --> 00:52:39,907
So there's definitely one there.

838
00:52:39,974 --> 00:52:42,310
-Sun... -There's definitely one on this island's famous spot.

839
00:52:42,343 --> 00:52:46,047
Take a look at, teh solar panel here!

840
00:52:46,948 --> 00:52:48,716
Ah, but why is this so high so high up?

841
00:52:48,783 --> 00:52:53,154
-Where do we go? Ah, this is really... -I'm really too tired now.

842
00:52:54,555 --> 00:52:55,957
Oh, it's here!

843
00:53:14,108 --> 00:53:16,477
What's over there?

844
00:53:16,477 --> 00:53:19,747
Hey, we needed it. We found it.

845
00:53:19,814 --> 00:53:23,718
-Ah, be careful it doesn't fall out! -This jacket doesn't have pockets.

846
00:53:23,784 --> 00:53:27,255
Let's split up. You go there and take a look, I'll go this way!

847
00:53:38,733 --> 00:53:40,568
Wow, how do we search here?

848
00:53:47,942 --> 00:53:49,911
Hello.

849
00:53:49,944 --> 00:53:50,811
Hey Gwang Soo.

850
00:53:50,878 --> 00:53:52,113
Hyung.

851
00:53:52,180 --> 00:53:55,316
Where are these things usually placed?

852
00:53:55,383 --> 00:53:58,953
I've honestly never, found these things too.

853
00:53:58,986 --> 00:54:03,257
I usually just watch it when it broadcasts.

854
00:54:03,324 --> 00:54:07,461
Look at these. These things that appear out of nowhere might have something.

855
00:54:07,495 --> 00:54:11,999
Something like this, like this. A place somewhat like this?

856
00:54:13,067 --> 00:54:15,102
It should be in those places that you wouldn't notice.

857
00:54:15,136 --> 00:54:17,004
-Those places that don't catch your eye at once. -Yes.

858
00:54:17,071 --> 00:54:19,207
And they just stick out.

859
00:54:20,174 --> 00:54:22,243
Isn’t that a helicopter there?

860
00:54:22,276 --> 00:54:24,212
Oh, should we go see?

861
00:54:33,654 --> 00:54:36,190
Wow, this is too cool.

862
00:54:36,257 --> 00:54:38,960
Why would a helicopter be here?

863
00:54:47,034 --> 00:54:51,272
This helicopter, couldn't this helicopter be on top of it, holding it down?

864
00:54:51,305 --> 00:54:53,574
Then we’ll have to check below the helicopter?

865
00:54:53,641 --> 00:54:57,311
Let’s lift it up once and see.

866
00:54:57,378 --> 00:54:59,146
One Two Three!

867
00:55:10,458 --> 00:55:12,093
Ah, this isn't it.

868
00:55:24,272 --> 00:55:26,874
What about Number 8?

869
00:55:31,512 --> 00:55:34,849
Oh, oh, the Blue Team's here, the Blue Team's here!

870
00:55:54,635 --> 00:55:56,671
Oh, we've arrived.

871
00:55:56,704 --> 00:55:58,306
Wow, we're here.

872
00:56:00,341 --> 00:56:02,243
The Blue Team is about to start!

873
00:56:02,310 --> 00:56:03,678
Hey, we have to take this off.

874
00:56:05,846 --> 00:56:07,915
We have to find 13 to 16 right?

875
00:56:09,717 --> 00:56:10,851
13,16.

876
00:56:11,185 --> 00:56:13,087
Finding those that are nearer will be more advantageous.

877
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:14,855
Oh, it's quite all right.

878
00:56:17,792 --> 00:56:19,593
Hyung, a chive field. Let's search in the chive field?

879
00:56:19,627 --> 00:56:21,329
It might be in the chive field!

880
00:56:22,530 --> 00:56:24,131
I think it's hidden.

881
00:56:25,733 --> 00:56:26,801
I don't think it should be so easy?

882
00:56:28,803 --> 00:56:31,305
It's not here, nothing here.

883
00:56:31,305 --> 00:56:33,174
It shouldn't be here.

884
00:56:40,915 --> 00:56:42,249
-Then what should we do? -Hyung!

885
00:56:42,316 --> 00:56:43,718
Why, is there something?

886
00:56:43,784 --> 00:56:44,985
Someone took something away from here.

887
00:56:45,019 --> 00:56:49,090
Yes, it's a bit weird here but nothing's here.

888
00:56:49,156 --> 00:56:51,692
You have to find the person and take it from him.

889
00:56:51,726 --> 00:56:53,160
The person who took it?

890
00:56:53,227 --> 00:56:55,029
We can take it from the person who found it?

891
00:56:55,096 --> 00:56:56,764
-The person who found it. -Great

892
00:56:56,797 --> 00:56:59,133
If we take person's number... Hey, does this make sense?

893
00:56:59,166 --> 00:57:00,601
Where was it?

894
00:57:00,668 --> 00:57:01,569
Someone took it!

895
00:57:01,635 --> 00:57:03,804
Ah, there's a camera inside.

896
00:57:03,838 --> 00:57:05,639
Ah, there's another kennel?

897
00:57:08,309 --> 00:57:12,813
I feel, hey...it's not that we didn't see it...

898
00:57:16,751 --> 00:57:18,953
Are you shooting a pictorial?

899
00:57:34,835 --> 00:57:36,404
The ending!

900
00:57:57,691 --> 00:58:01,562
Are we going there?

901
00:58:01,595 --> 00:58:02,963
Of course we have to go.

902
00:58:03,030 --> 00:58:04,932
We’re here already so why not?

903
00:58:06,700 --> 00:58:08,536
Hyung, are you going up there?

904
00:58:08,602 --> 00:58:10,805
I have to take a look!

905
00:58:10,871 --> 00:58:14,875
What are you doing now?

906
00:58:28,956 --> 00:58:30,758
Hey.

907
00:58:30,825 --> 00:58:32,827
Kwon Ryeol, what are you doing?

908
00:58:38,666 --> 00:58:42,136
If we turn here, if we turn here we'll definitely find something.

909
00:58:52,079 --> 00:58:55,316
I, I should be doing it, why did you do it?

910
00:58:55,349 --> 00:58:58,552
"Ohh". Why are you doing this?

911
00:58:59,753 --> 00:59:03,357
Nothing. There's nothing.

912
00:59:03,424 --> 00:59:05,092
Oh!

913
00:59:05,125 --> 00:59:06,560
What is it?

914
00:59:13,567 --> 00:59:17,404
What's that there, what's that there, what's that?

915
00:59:17,471 --> 00:59:22,076
It wouldn’t be wild pigs right?

916
00:59:27,181 --> 00:59:31,585
You should have been fliming me, why did you turn around and flim?

917
00:59:34,555 --> 00:59:36,857
Let's go back first. Let's go back first.

918
00:59:36,891 --> 00:59:41,262
I found it!

919
00:59:51,305 --> 00:59:55,209
I found it!

920
00:59:58,245 --> 00:59:59,313
I found it!

921
01:00:00,347 --> 01:00:01,749
Don't lie.

922
01:00:03,017 --> 01:00:04,552
I found it!

923
01:00:04,618 --> 01:00:06,554
I found it!

924
01:00:06,620 --> 01:00:08,756
What number is it?

925
01:00:08,822 --> 01:00:10,624
Number 13!

926
01:00:10,658 --> 01:00:12,526
Number 13 is here though?

927
01:00:12,560 --> 01:00:14,728
I found it!

928
01:00:14,762 --> 01:00:17,197
Number  13’s here though!

929
01:00:17,231 --> 01:00:18,365
Hey, IU!

930
01:00:18,599 --> 01:00:21,769
IU of Year 3 Class 2, come out!

931
01:00:22,036 --> 01:00:24,738
I have something to say to you!

932
01:00:24,805 --> 01:00:26,206
I like you!

933
01:00:27,741 --> 01:00:29,577
Please wait for a year!

934
01:00:30,477 --> 01:00:32,746
IU, I like you!

935
01:00:34,114 --> 01:00:35,449
Ha!

936
01:00:35,516 --> 01:00:37,184
Dong!

937
01:00:44,825 --> 01:00:46,493
Hey, you're seriously...

938
01:00:46,527 --> 01:00:50,731
Hyung is now... hey, I came out from the wilderness.

939
01:00:50,798 --> 01:00:53,500
You’re here confessing your love to IU?

940
01:00:53,567 --> 01:00:57,338
What are you doing here and not searching?

941
01:00:57,404 --> 01:00:58,606
Hyung, I wrote this.

942
01:00:58,672 --> 01:01:00,107
What is it?

943
01:01:00,174 --> 01:01:04,211
Hey, I have one too.

944
01:01:04,278 --> 01:01:06,513
-Why did you do this? -Hyung, it isn't for that.

945
01:01:06,547 --> 01:01:07,181
Why?

946
01:01:07,214 --> 01:01:08,882
The one who controls space.

947
01:01:08,949 --> 01:01:10,484
Hey, it shoulf be like this.

948
01:01:10,517 --> 01:01:14,388
The one who controls space!

949
01:01:15,456 --> 01:01:19,526
Hey, you're really...

950
01:01:28,135 --> 01:01:30,204
While I’m talking to you nicely, go to another team

951
01:01:32,039 --> 01:01:34,842
Staying in this team doesn't have any meaning too.

952
01:01:37,678 --> 01:01:39,680
You're really...

953
01:01:39,747 --> 01:01:41,081
Help the team a little.

954
01:01:41,148 --> 01:01:43,083
Do you want to go back in time to this morning?

955
01:01:43,117 --> 01:01:44,918
I'm going crazy.

956
01:01:46,587 --> 01:01:47,955
That’s our team?

957
01:01:48,022 --> 01:01:50,124
Is that Sang Wook?

958
01:01:50,157 --> 01:01:50,691
Yes.

959
01:01:50,758 --> 01:01:52,026
Sang Wook!

960
01:01:53,961 --> 01:01:55,462
Joo Sang Wook!

961
01:01:55,496 --> 01:01:57,931
This is just like the training in the army.

962
01:01:59,199 --> 01:02:00,768
Joo Sang Wook!

963
01:02:03,003 --> 01:02:04,071
Joo Sang Wook!

964
01:02:07,307 --> 01:02:09,410
Why are you coming over here?

965
01:02:09,476 --> 01:02:10,944
Hey, Joo Sang Wook!

966
01:02:11,011 --> 01:02:12,746
Just stay there!

967
01:02:12,780 --> 01:02:15,015
-He's really werid, really strange. -He's really strange.

968
01:02:15,049 --> 01:02:17,851
-Ah, he was over there so why is he running over? -Let's walk over to him.

969
01:02:26,927 --> 01:02:27,528
Ah, hyung!

970
01:02:27,594 --> 01:02:29,530
Wow, what?

971
01:02:32,499 --> 01:02:35,703
Hey, you really ran over, from there?

972
01:02:35,736 --> 01:02:37,538
Ah, I found it.

973
01:02:37,604 --> 01:02:39,339
-Just over there. -What did you find?

974
01:02:39,406 --> 01:02:40,774
This.

975
01:02:48,015 --> 01:02:50,150
We'll have to go down.

976
01:02:50,217 --> 01:02:54,922
So we'll just have to tear off Suk Jin hyung and IU's numbers.

977
01:03:09,770 --> 01:03:11,739
Looks like Jin Hee can find it.

978
01:03:13,207 --> 01:03:14,875
There should be a camera or something?

979
01:03:18,112 --> 01:03:18,979
Where are they all?

980
01:03:19,346 --> 01:03:21,014
Up there.

981
01:03:21,115 --> 01:03:23,917
-Let's go up first... -Ok, they're up there now.

982
01:03:23,984 --> 01:03:25,085
Hyung, hyung, they're over there.

983
01:03:25,152 --> 01:03:27,688
Look at that yellow, Gwang Soo and someone from the Yellow Team.

984
01:03:27,755 --> 01:03:29,556
The Yellow Team's over there.

985
01:03:29,590 --> 01:03:31,358
Why is the Yellow Team there?

986
01:03:31,391 --> 01:03:32,593
They're pointing at something.

987
01:03:32,659 --> 01:03:35,763
Shall we create a commotion?

988
01:03:36,997 --> 01:03:38,732
I found it!

989
01:03:38,799 --> 01:03:40,467
I found it!

990
01:03:41,535 --> 01:03:43,604
I found it!

991
01:03:43,670 --> 01:03:45,906
Wee found two, two!

992
01:03:48,208 --> 01:03:49,943
They should be super confused right?

993
01:03:51,578 --> 01:03:53,747
-Who found it? -Gwang Soo found it.

994
01:03:53,814 --> 01:03:56,016
If they find it we can just snatch it over.

995
01:03:56,049 --> 01:03:57,317
We have to snatch it over. Who found it?

996
01:03:57,317 --> 01:04:01,421
We have to see who found it.

997
01:04:04,491 --> 01:04:07,728
Hey, it's the Red Team, it's Red Team!

998
01:04:07,795 --> 01:04:09,296
-Where? -There, there!

999
01:04:11,165 --> 01:04:14,868
Hyung, we've searched this side but there's nothing.

1000
01:04:14,902 --> 01:04:16,637
It's all been taken by the Yellow Team.

1001
01:04:16,670 --> 01:04:19,506
Why are four people walking together like this?

1002
01:04:19,573 --> 01:04:21,875
Seems like there's something here?

1003
01:04:21,942 --> 01:04:24,678
It could be appropriate later, appropriate.

1004
01:04:24,812 --> 01:04:26,480
Where's Ji Hyo, Ji Hyo?

1005
01:04:26,547 --> 01:04:28,715
You seem to have something in that pocket?

1006
01:04:28,782 --> 01:04:31,185
Ah, here, here, there's something here.

1007
01:04:31,218 --> 01:04:32,853
For me...

1008
01:04:39,359 --> 01:04:40,994
I've always been like this!

1009
01:04:43,997 --> 01:04:46,767
Hey, I'm really on the right side today, I am!

1010
01:04:46,867 --> 01:04:49,870
I'm really, lucky today.

1011
01:04:49,937 --> 01:04:51,371
That's not it.

1012
01:04:51,471 --> 01:04:53,674
Hey Dong Hoon.

1013
01:04:56,076 --> 01:04:57,344
Where are you going!!

1014
01:04:58,979 --> 01:05:01,281
Should I tears yours off, me?

1015
01:05:01,348 --> 01:05:03,350
We don't know anything.

1016
01:05:03,417 --> 01:05:04,918
Then we just won't tear yours off first!

1017
01:05:04,985 --> 01:05:07,321
-We'll see you later. -We'll see you later!

1018
01:05:08,555 --> 01:05:09,857
We'll see you at the top.

1019
01:05:09,923 --> 01:05:11,491
We won't let you off the next time!

1020
01:05:11,558 --> 01:05:14,294
Ji Ji Ji Ji baby baby.

1021
01:05:14,361 --> 01:05:16,096
Hyung, is he making fun of you now?

1022
01:05:16,163 --> 01:05:18,198
Oh, provoking... Jin Hee, he's making fun of you.

1023
01:05:18,232 --> 01:05:19,867
-Then what should I do? -Hey, call him a Grasshopper.

1024
01:05:19,900 --> 01:05:21,969
-Ah, how can I... -Try it, for once.

1025
01:05:22,035 --> 01:05:25,439
...Call the Nation Grasshopper a Grasshopper?

1026
01:05:27,941 --> 01:05:31,011
-It's the Nation's Grasshopper! -The Nation's Grasshopper.

1027
01:05:31,078 --> 01:05:32,412
The Nation's Grasshopper!

1028
01:05:32,512 --> 01:05:33,513
The Nation's Hopper, the Nation's Hopper.

1029
01:05:33,547 --> 01:05:34,882
The Nation's Hopper.

1030
01:05:34,948 --> 01:05:36,917
-Found anything? -Nothing.

1031
01:05:37,017 --> 01:05:38,619
Let's move together.

1032
01:05:38,685 --> 01:05:40,888
-Ah, together. -Yes, let's move off together first.

1033
01:05:40,921 --> 01:05:45,926
Now on that side, both Gwang Soo and Chun Hee are together.

1034
01:05:45,993 --> 01:05:49,363
Ah, it's most likely down there.

1035
01:05:49,396 --> 01:05:50,898
-I didn't see anything at all. -Nothing?

1036
01:05:50,931 --> 01:05:54,768
Are you tired?

1037
01:05:54,801 --> 01:05:56,336
I’m hungry.

1038
01:06:02,776 --> 01:06:04,278
Let's, take a look in here!

1039
01:06:08,615 --> 01:06:11,718
-Yi-yoo. -Yes?

1040
01:06:13,787 --> 01:06:15,489
Are you hungry?

1041
01:06:15,522 --> 01:06:16,857
-Huh? -Do you want to eat this?

1042
01:06:24,798 --> 01:06:29,369
Oh!

1043
01:06:37,978 --> 01:06:41,748
Deabak.

1044
01:06:43,817 --> 01:06:46,186
No, how could it, be here?

1045
01:06:46,219 --> 01:06:48,755
How do we find it here?

1046
01:06:51,391 --> 01:06:53,927
Ah, hiding it here is really...

1047
01:06:55,996 --> 01:06:59,399
Ah, I really want to find one.

1048
01:06:59,466 --> 01:07:02,936
Oh.

1049
01:07:16,483 --> 01:07:19,119
14.

1050
01:07:31,098 --> 01:07:34,334
The numbers found up till now are 13,14,16!

1051
01:07:42,876 --> 01:07:44,077
This is HaHa oppa's.

1052
01:07:44,111 --> 01:07:45,645
We can go this way.

1053
01:07:46,847 --> 01:07:48,715
Then what should we do now?

1054
01:07:55,389 --> 01:07:56,456
Run quickly.

1055
01:07:56,490 --> 01:07:57,891
Follow me!

1056
01:07:59,359 --> 01:08:00,727
Follow me!

1057
01:08:00,794 --> 01:08:03,964
Where has our team gone?

1058
01:08:08,835 --> 01:08:10,237
Follow me!

1059
01:08:10,270 --> 01:08:14,341
Gwang Soo and all, they're being chased over there.

1060
01:08:15,409 --> 01:08:20,080
Hey, do it quickly before Sung Soo comes.

1061
01:08:22,516 --> 01:08:23,350
Oh, there. They went there.

1062
01:08:24,584 --> 01:08:26,686
-Where? -The Red Team's there.

1063
01:08:26,753 --> 01:08:28,855
Jin Hee, put on your detective gloves.

1064
01:08:28,922 --> 01:08:31,458
Your detective gloves, the most useful gloves today.

1065
01:08:50,043 --> 01:08:50,811
Hey, what do we do?

1066
01:08:53,313 --> 01:08:54,114
-Hyung. -What is it?

1067
01:08:54,147 --> 01:08:56,016
Are you coming to tear ours off?

1068
01:08:58,819 --> 01:08:59,486
Hang on.

1069
01:08:59,519 --> 01:09:01,822
Hide, Yi-yoo.

1070
01:09:04,524 --> 01:09:06,393
Don't do this. Don't do this.

1071
01:09:06,460 --> 01:09:09,463
Hyung, I'm a courageous man today.

1072
01:09:09,496 --> 01:09:11,465
Yi-yoo, come here.

1073
01:09:11,498 --> 01:09:12,866
What are you saying?

1074
01:09:12,899 --> 01:09:14,067
Yi-yoo.

1075
01:09:16,136 --> 01:09:17,370
He's coming over!

1076
01:09:17,404 --> 01:09:19,039
Wait. They're here, Chun Hee hyung!

1077
01:09:19,072 --> 01:09:20,340
No, no!

1078
01:09:20,373 --> 01:09:21,575
Yi-yoo!

1079
01:09:21,608 --> 01:09:25,612
-Yi-yoo, stay where you are. I'm sorry. -No, no.

1080
01:09:32,752 --> 01:09:34,121
Run, run!

1081
01:09:34,154 --> 01:09:36,790
What do I do? Oppa, hurry!

1082
01:09:36,823 --> 01:09:39,192
Catch him!

1083
01:09:50,370 --> 01:09:53,840
Although we don't know which side will win, someone will tire out on each team.

1084
01:09:53,907 --> 01:09:55,709
-Right. -What are the numbers?

1085
01:09:55,775 --> 01:09:56,877
It's best to go when they're out of strength.

1086
01:09:56,943 --> 01:09:58,845
So when their fight's almost over...

1087
01:09:58,879 --> 01:10:01,348
-We'll go. -It'd be fine if I go during that time.

1088
01:10:01,414 --> 01:10:03,750
Oh, Ji Ge Liang! Ji Ge Liang!

1089
01:10:03,783 --> 01:10:06,887
This strategy is really like Ji Ge Liang.

1090
01:10:06,920 --> 01:10:10,056
Supposing that they will walk there after they fight,

1091
01:10:10,090 --> 01:10:11,691
Going up or going down..?

1092
01:10:11,758 --> 01:10:16,129
-Should be going down.. How about waiting down there? -Then let's wait for them down there.

1093
01:10:16,163 --> 01:10:18,832
-Zhuge Liang! -Under that.

1094
01:10:18,865 --> 01:10:22,502
Hyung! It seems like they will join forces.

1095
01:10:22,569 --> 01:10:24,404
Then let's observe awhile more.

1096
01:10:24,404 --> 01:10:25,405
Look at the atmosphere around them.

1097
01:10:25,438 --> 01:10:27,407
We have three teams.

1098
01:10:28,575 --> 01:10:30,677
Those people. Those people.

1099
01:10:30,777 --> 01:10:34,781
There are four people there, why not join forces?

1100
01:10:34,848 --> 01:10:37,617
We have three teams.

1101
01:10:37,684 --> 01:10:40,387
Although the winner is not known,

1102
01:10:40,387 --> 01:10:42,989
One of us should be the winner.

1103
01:10:43,056 --> 01:10:46,059
-Eliminate the Bule team first. The Bule team is too strong.

1104
01:10:46,126 --> 01:10:50,197
Gwang Soo, shout"Kim Jong Kook come out!" and run away.

1105
01:10:52,933 --> 01:10:54,668
Make him come down from there.

1106
01:10:54,701 --> 01:10:56,536
If you two do ti, they'll get angry.

1107
01:11:00,073 --> 01:11:01,775
They aren't talking about us right?

1108
01:11:05,078 --> 01:11:06,613
Are they talking to me?

1109
01:11:06,680 --> 01:11:09,316
Kim Jong Kook get down here!

1110
01:11:09,382 --> 01:11:10,951
Don't hide there! Get down here!

1111
01:11:11,017 --> 01:11:13,186
Kim Jong Kook come out! Are you scared of us?!

1112
01:11:13,220 --> 01:11:15,322
They already joined forces.

1113
01:11:15,388 --> 01:11:17,524
IU is at the back.

1114
01:11:23,230 --> 01:11:26,766
Kim Jong Kook come out! Are you scared of us?!

1115
01:11:26,833 --> 01:11:29,970
HaHa, HaHa, there's danger.

1116
01:11:30,036 --> 01:11:32,405
HaHa, HaHa, there's danger.

1117
01:11:32,472 --> 01:11:35,075
What are you doing?

1118
01:11:46,186 --> 01:11:49,189
They're fighting! They're fighting!

1119
01:11:53,426 --> 01:11:54,060
Let go!

1120
01:12:06,406 --> 01:12:08,875
I've torn it out!

1121
01:12:13,780 --> 01:12:16,249
Torn out! Torn out! Torn out again!

1122
01:12:16,283 --> 01:12:17,150
It's Gwang Soo!

1123
01:12:17,217 --> 01:12:19,519
That's why we said joining forces is not possible!

1124
01:12:19,586 --> 01:12:21,655
Gwang Soo got torn out first!

1125
01:12:21,688 --> 01:12:23,923
It was tore out at the same time! At the same time!

1126
01:12:37,704 --> 01:12:39,806
HaHa torn off Gwang Soo's tag first.

1127
01:12:39,873 --> 01:12:41,775
Afterward, Gwang Soo tore HaHa's tag out.

1128
01:12:41,808 --> 01:12:46,079
Followed by Sung Wook tearing out Ji Hyo's tag.

1129
01:12:46,146 --> 01:12:48,915
Quickly give your number to the Red Team, Gwang Soo.

1130
01:12:48,982 --> 01:12:50,917
We have a chance of winning!

1131
01:12:53,920 --> 01:12:56,356
Gwang Soo, faster. Hand it over to us.

1132
01:12:56,423 --> 01:12:58,591
-That team came down. -Faster!

1133
01:12:58,658 --> 01:13:01,027
That team is coming to us now! Quick!

1134
01:13:01,127 --> 01:13:04,431
Quickly! Hand it over!

1135
01:13:06,466 --> 01:13:07,367
Gwang Soo, where is it?

1136
01:13:07,367 --> 01:13:08,735
Sung Soo, you too hurry and leave!

1137
01:13:10,503 --> 01:13:12,038
Give me. Give me.

1138
01:13:12,105 --> 01:13:13,873
Hyung! That's 15 and 16. What's this?

1139
01:13:13,907 --> 01:13:15,608
What are you doing not escaping?!

1140
01:13:29,956 --> 01:13:31,591
Move back.

1141
01:13:34,694 --> 01:13:36,196
I'm number 8.

1142
01:13:36,262 --> 01:13:38,665
Number 3. Number 16.

1143
01:13:52,645 --> 01:13:54,180
Look at Jin Hee.

1144
01:14:07,327 --> 01:14:11,297
We only need to get one out of these two numbers.

1145
01:14:11,364 --> 01:14:15,268
This game will then end and we will win.

1146
01:14:26,579 --> 01:14:29,883
Why are you coming from there?! So troublesome!

1147
01:14:32,619 --> 01:14:35,789
Hyung, I saw you already.

1148
01:14:39,659 --> 01:14:41,494
Our team hasn't arrived?!

1149
01:14:47,834 --> 01:14:49,569
-Hyung was there. I saw it all. -Really?

1150
01:14:49,636 --> 01:14:53,907
-If you come up from there, you will be totally exhausted! -You suddenly talking to me like that...

1151
01:14:53,973 --> 01:14:56,576
You're making me embarrassed.

1152
01:14:56,676 --> 01:14:58,912
What do you all plan to do?

1153
01:14:59,012 --> 01:15:01,414
You guys seemed to have joined forces.

1154
01:15:01,448 --> 01:15:03,883
The moment we show our back, it's over.

1155
01:15:12,392 --> 01:15:14,294
Jin Hee hyung is coming! Jin Hee hyung is coming!

1156
01:15:14,360 --> 01:15:17,931
Ya! Ya! Ya! Jin Hee hyung!

1157
01:15:17,997 --> 01:15:20,967
Hyung! Even your shirt is torn!

1158
01:15:42,789 --> 01:15:45,358
Jin Hee hyung is coming! Jin Hee hyung is coming!

1159
01:15:49,729 --> 01:15:52,532
-Hyung! Let go! -Faster come over! -Faster come over!

1160
01:15:57,737 --> 01:15:59,839
He's here!

1161
01:16:13,586 --> 01:16:17,123
Number 10 either Gary or Jin Hee Number 11.

1162
01:16:26,799 --> 01:16:31,271
Sung Soo! Sung Soo! Faster!

1163
01:16:31,337 --> 01:16:33,206
Everyone go! Everyone go!

1164
01:16:36,910 --> 01:16:39,145
Both teams are safe..

1165
01:16:58,364 --> 01:16:59,766
Hey, not our team!

1166
01:17:03,303 --> 01:17:05,438
-IU what are you doing?! - This is a misunderstanding!

1167
01:17:11,945 --> 01:17:13,413
-IU what are you doing?!

1168
01:17:14,581 --> 01:17:16,015
IU is here.

1169
01:17:16,716 --> 01:17:18,384
It's not me. Oppa!

1170
01:17:35,068 --> 01:17:36,269
Our team only needs 10 and 11.

1171
01:17:36,569 --> 01:17:37,704
Who is number 10?

1172
01:17:37,704 --> 01:17:39,138
Either Gary..

1173
01:18:12,639 --> 01:18:13,840
Our team only needs 10 and 11.

1174
01:18:14,140 --> 01:18:15,274
Who is number 10?

1175
01:18:15,274 --> 01:18:16,709
Either Gary..

1176
01:18:42,568 --> 01:18:47,206
-Bingo! -Bingo!

1177
01:18:47,240 --> 01:18:50,543
-I love you all! -Bingo!

1178
01:18:57,750 --> 01:19:01,688
Red team Bingo.

1179
01:19:04,190 --> 01:19:06,259
The award for this success is to travel in a helicopter.

1180
01:19:13,599 --> 01:19:17,336
Goodbye everyone!

1181
01:19:17,603 --> 01:19:20,473
Hello!

1182
01:19:22,608 --> 01:19:25,044
Move to the back.

1183
01:19:27,213 --> 01:19:29,716
It's taking off.

1184
01:20:17,964 --> 01:20:21,434
HaHa! HaHa! I'm really scared!

1185
01:20:21,501 --> 01:20:23,536
Captain, hold on.

1186
01:20:23,603 --> 01:20:25,905
Taking the helicopter looks rather troublesome.

1187
01:20:25,905 --> 01:20:28,775
Feels like it is turning around on purpose.
