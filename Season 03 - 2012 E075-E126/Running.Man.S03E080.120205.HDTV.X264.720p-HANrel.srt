1
00:00:48,165 --> 00:00:49,633
Is the money yours?

2
00:00:49,633 --> 00:00:51,235
Return it to me.

3
00:01:19,964 --> 00:01:22,133
I became a gisaeng just like this.

4
00:01:22,133 --> 00:01:24,735
Im Soo Hyang from 'New Gisaeng Story'.

5
00:01:25,403 --> 00:01:27,304
Thank you.

6
00:01:48,492 --> 00:01:50,728
'Baek Hyo Min, congratulations,

7
00:01:50,728 --> 00:01:52,029
Thank you.

8
00:01:56,901 --> 00:02:00,404
-It's cold. -Hello.

9
00:02:00,671 --> 00:02:03,541
Ah unnie, you were all watching.

10
00:02:18,255 --> 00:02:21,158
Today we're Charlie's Angels.

11
00:02:21,525 --> 00:02:22,359
Have you had breakfast?

12
00:02:22,359 --> 00:02:23,727
Not yet.

13
00:02:23,861 --> 00:02:24,662
Oh..really?

14
00:02:24,762 --> 00:02:29,934
Ah I. prepared this. Do you know this?

15
00:02:29,934 --> 00:02:31,268
Thank you.

16
00:02:31,268 --> 00:02:36,273
I just opened this one, I only have two.

17
00:02:36,841 --> 00:02:39,743
Unnie, how old are you?

18
00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:42,146
I'm an early 90er.

19
00:02:42,146 --> 00:02:43,781
I'm just a 90er.

20
00:02:44,482 --> 00:02:48,652
I'm an 89er, so that means I'm the eldest.

21
00:02:51,789 --> 00:02:54,625
Let's talk informally, since our ages are similar.

22
00:02:54,625 --> 00:02:55,426
Yes, yes.

23
00:02:55,626 --> 00:02:59,163
Please help look after us. I'm really not good at this, unnie.

24
00:03:03,567 --> 00:03:08,072
Good morning, Angels,

25
00:03:11,075 --> 00:03:15,746
You are here today because of a secret  mission.

26
00:03:19,483 --> 00:03:23,754
Infiltrate Running Men as Spies, and eliminate all Running Men.

27
00:03:24,021 --> 00:03:29,593
One of you must survive till the end for the Charlie's Angels to win.

28
00:03:30,394 --> 00:03:33,998
Later you will start the race together with the Running Men.

29
00:03:33,998 --> 00:03:39,970
If you don't want your identifies as Spies to be exposed, you have to prevent the Running Men from obtaining the hints.

30
00:03:44,108 --> 00:03:47,578
You have to prevent the Running Men from obtaining the hints.

31
00:03:48,112 --> 00:03:50,748
Then I wish the Charlie's Angels good luck.

32
00:03:55,452 --> 00:03:57,054
I'm really not good at this.

33
00:03:57,354 --> 00:03:59,089
Unnie has to take the lead.

34
00:03:59,089 --> 00:04:00,624
My heart's beating very fast.

35
00:04:00,624 --> 00:04:02,693
My face is all red.

36
00:04:02,693 --> 00:04:06,297
So. we have to hinder the Running Men from carrying out the mission.

37
00:04:06,297 --> 00:04:08,699
-We... - So we have to prevent them from getting the hints, us?

38
00:04:08,699 --> 00:04:13,337
If we're not quick, the Running Men will finish the mission first and get the hints. Right?

39
00:04:13,504 --> 00:04:15,573
-Right. So we have to be quick. -That's why we have to be quick.

40
00:04:15,573 --> 00:04:18,542
We're acting...?

41
00:04:18,542 --> 00:04:22,079
But Charlie is not allowed to reveal that he is Charlie

42
00:04:25,182 --> 00:04:29,086
Charlie is someone from our Running Man members.

43
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:32,489
One person knows our identities?

44
00:04:32,489 --> 00:04:34,391
They do know indeed.

45
00:04:34,525 --> 00:04:39,530
But Charlie is not allowed to reveal that who is Charlie.

46
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:41,332
Then we have to find Charlie ourselves?

47
00:04:41,332 --> 00:04:42,499
Oh no!

48
00:04:42,499 --> 00:04:44,735
Then that means we still have to know who Charlie is.

49
00:04:44,735 --> 00:04:47,771
-How do we know who Charlie is? -We have to find Charlie.

50
00:04:47,771 --> 00:04:49,139
Plus Charlie can't die.

51
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:53,877
We have to protect Charlie and get all the Running Men out.

52
00:04:53,877 --> 00:04:56,780
-Then are there any hints, about Charlie? -No.

53
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:59,617
-Oh. so how do we locate him? - It's really very tough.

54
00:04:59,617 --> 00:05:01,418
Seems like it will be very difficult to find him.

55
00:05:01,418 --> 00:05:03,754
-It's really very tough. -It really is.

56
00:05:04,255 --> 00:05:07,992
-What if we end up doing well after this talk? -It fully depends on our acting.

57
00:05:07,992 --> 00:05:09,526
I'll just depend on both of you.

58
00:05:09,526 --> 00:05:11,695
The junior has to make even more effort.

59
00:05:11,695 --> 00:05:13,931
Do you understand?

60
00:05:33,617 --> 00:05:36,553
Why am I first... huh?

61
00:05:36,954 --> 00:05:39,123
Why is there bread and milk?

62
00:05:39,123 --> 00:05:40,591
Are we having a meeting*?

63
00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:44,094
Oh. seems like a meeting today!

64
00:05:49,667 --> 00:05:51,568
I'm seriously...

65
00:05:52,369 --> 00:05:53,270
Hyung.

66
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:54,905
-We're not going skiing? -Hyung.

67
00:05:54,905 --> 00:05:57,274
My shoulders look very broad right?

68
00:05:58,742 --> 00:06:00,844
The fat bellied friend is here.

69
00:06:01,512 --> 00:06:03,347
What's this again?

70
00:06:06,717 --> 00:06:07,951
Nice to see you.

71
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:09,653
Oh. hey.

72
00:06:10,754 --> 00:06:12,823
Hey, what does this atmosphere look like?

73
00:06:13,424 --> 00:06:16,694
Right? Right?

74
00:06:20,731 --> 00:06:21,532
Ji Hyo!

75
00:06:21,532 --> 00:06:23,067
You're pretty.

76
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,270
-Wow. she's no joke. -She's so pretty.

77
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:27,271
Pink, pink.

78
00:06:27,271 --> 00:06:29,807
Hey Ji Hyo, you applied hot pink on your lips?

79
00:06:30,974 --> 00:06:33,544
Oh, what's with him?

80
00:06:33,544 --> 00:06:35,913
Hey. isn't that Kim Won Hyo, Kim Won Hyo?

81
00:06:37,881 --> 00:06:39,650
-Oh. what's that? -Hey.

82
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:41,018
It's not a joke...

83
00:06:41,018 --> 00:06:43,120
Running Man's fastest ageing kid.

84
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,221
Jeez, hyung.

85
00:06:44,221 --> 00:06:45,255
Really, Gwang Soo.

86
00:06:45,255 --> 00:06:46,790
Don't you think he's aged completely?

87
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:48,525
Oh, why is he like this?

88
00:06:48,525 --> 00:06:49,827
Why do you look so old?

89
00:06:49,827 --> 00:06:50,527
Suk Jin hyung's here.

90
00:06:50,527 --> 00:06:51,628
Suit Jin hyung...

91
00:06:52,663 --> 00:06:56,066
-What's that?%-Isn't that his own self? His normal style.

92
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:58,569
Why are you wearing a neck pillow?

93
00:06:58,569 --> 00:06:59,870
Hey, it's cold.

94
00:07:00,337 --> 00:07:01,638
Over here hyung, hyung.

95
00:07:01,638 --> 00:07:02,973
-Oh. -What does this atmosphere seem like?

96
00:07:02,973 --> 00:07:03,640
Why, what is it?

97
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:04,341
Hyung!

98
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:05,743
The clothes are very matching.

99
00:07:05,743 --> 00:07:08,178
Hey, Ji Hyo's sitting over there now.

100
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:11,515
Who is it, today? I'm going crazy.

101
00:07:11,515 --> 00:07:17,454
Today it's a Retro Meeting Race.

102
00:07:17,988 --> 00:07:19,423
This is it!

103
00:07:19,423 --> 00:07:20,624
How many are there?

104
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:26,897
Today. the meeting participants, are stars to watch for in 2012.

105
00:07:26,997 --> 00:07:28,565
See.

106
00:07:28,565 --> 00:07:30,334
Done!

107
00:07:30,334 --> 00:07:32,169
I'm going crazy!

108
00:07:32,703 --> 00:07:34,271
-Please sit down -Ah, yes.

109
00:07:34,271 --> 00:07:35,639
What are you doing?

110
00:07:36,774 --> 00:07:37,508
Hey.

111
00:07:37,508 --> 00:07:39,176
-Oppa, now... - hope it's someone I like.

112
00:07:39,176 --> 00:07:41,712
The thing is that there are only four milk cartons here.

113
00:07:41,712 --> 00:07:42,780
-Oh! -That's right.

114
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:44,581
Two people here will be excluded.

115
00:07:45,349 --> 00:07:48,285
-Then it will Suk Jin hyung and... -Feel, touch, cross!

116
00:07:48,285 --> 00:07:49,987
Hey, why is it me?

117
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,822
-Hey, Gwang Soo. -Feel, feel!

118
00:07:51,822 --> 00:07:52,623
Hey. why?

119
00:07:52,689 --> 00:07:53,390
What's 'Feel, feel'?

120
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:54,925
It's not 'Feel, touch'.

121
00:07:54,925 --> 00:07:56,527
It might be you being on your own!

122
00:07:56,894 --> 00:08:00,063
And Ji Hyo, you put too much rouge, don't do this.

123
00:08:00,597 --> 00:08:02,099
-Oppa, this is excessive. -Hey.

124
00:08:02,099 --> 00:08:06,170
-One thing to note, it's not two people eliminated today but three -It's you. you, you.

125
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:09,540
Hey, you're included too, you.

126
00:08:10,808 --> 00:08:11,575
Ok, we'll...

127
00:08:11,575 --> 00:08:13,710
Let's turn our heads away.

00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:18,382
Without further ado. will the first beauty, please come out!

129
00:08:18,382 --> 00:08:18,982
Is it all right if I like her?

130
00:08:18,982 --> 00:08:21,351
-I'm going to close my eyes. -Hey Gary, can I be at ease?

131
00:08:21,351 --> 00:08:22,586
She's young, she's young.

132
00:08:22,586 --> 00:08:24,388
She's petite, she's petite. She's petite.

133
00:08:24,388 --> 00:08:25,889
Who is it. who?

134
00:08:25,889 --> 00:08:28,625
Oh, who is it?

135
00:08:28,625 --> 00:08:30,894
Who is it?

136
00:08:34,798 --> 00:08:36,567
She's pretty, she's pretty.

137
00:08:43,373 --> 00:08:48,745
She's pretty! She's pretty!

138
00:08:48,745 --> 00:08:50,948
Im Soo Hyang.

139
00:08:51,348 --> 00:08:53,050
Do you know her, Gwang Soo?

140
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:53,951
You know her too?

141
00:08:53,951 --> 00:08:54,885
How do you know her?

142
00:08:54,885 --> 00:08:56,954
Im Soo Hyang was in 'New Gisaeng Story'.

143
00:08:56,954 --> 00:08:58,655
Ah, 'New Gisaeng Story'.

144
00:08:58,655 --> 00:09:01,091
-You came all this way? -Nice to meet you!

145
00:09:01,091 --> 00:09:02,292
Soo Hyang!

146
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:04,695
She mentioned us at the Entertainment Awards.

147
00:09:04,695 --> 00:09:07,631
I like Running Man a lot.

148
00:09:07,631 --> 00:09:09,833
You have to invite me.

149
00:09:09,833 --> 00:09:11,235
Eat as you wish.

150
00:09:11,235 --> 00:09:14,705
-Oh, Soo Hyang also sat in front of the strawberry milk. -Ah, yes.

151
00:09:14,705 --> 00:09:16,607
Switch, switch.

152
00:09:19,009 --> 00:09:21,411
Then the next person after Soo Hyang.

153
00:09:21,411 --> 00:09:23,714
The next person, please come out!

154
00:09:27,484 --> 00:09:29,553
Looks a little familiar.

155
00:09:39,763 --> 00:09:45,002
Wow, Hyo Min!

156
00:09:48,338 --> 00:09:50,307
Roly, Roly!

157
00:09:50,307 --> 00:09:53,076
Nice to meet you, Hyo Min.

158
00:09:53,076 --> 00:09:55,646
Hello.

159
00:09:58,715 --> 00:10:01,585
They did a drama together!

160
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:04,888
-It's been such a long time! -Unnie is so pretty.

161
00:10:04,888 --> 00:10:06,123
Sit down, sit down.

162
00:10:06,123 --> 00:10:07,424
This is refreshing.

163
00:10:07,491 --> 00:10:10,394
Jae Suk oppa keeps pulling his pants up Ills waist.

164
00:10:12,563 --> 00:10:14,231
This Is high waist.

165
00:10:14,398 --> 00:10:16,366
Ji Hyo, this is high waist.

166
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:20,103
Hey, seriously. We're really with Hyo Min and Soo Hyang.

167
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:22,239
Hey, don't keep staring at them. Why are you like this?

168
00:10:22,272 --> 00:10:24,875
I can't stand Gwang Soo's look.

169
00:10:24,975 --> 00:10:27,844
Don't be afraid. You're surprised because of Gwang Soo's wide. forehead right?

170
00:10:27,945 --> 00:10:30,080
What are you saying?

171
00:10:30,681 --> 00:10:32,749
You're sitting in the centre and your forehead is reflecting light.

172
00:10:32,783 --> 00:10:34,885
I combed it back on purpose like this.

173
00:10:34,918 --> 00:10:36,553
Right, your wrinkles are all coming out.

174
00:10:36,954 --> 00:10:38,889
Why are you looking like this?

175
00:10:38,889 --> 00:10:41,191
-It's really very wide. -You'd do well to get rid of it.

176
00:10:42,993 --> 00:10:44,995
-There's still one more, still one more. -One more, the last person!

177
00:10:45,395 --> 00:10:46,830
Ok, please come out!

178
00:10:46,863 --> 00:10:48,532
Who is it, who is it?

179
00:11:07,484 --> 00:11:09,052
Go A Ra!

180
00:11:09,386 --> 00:11:10,654
Oh my god.

181
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:15,592
Oppa. hello.

182
00:11:18,028 --> 00:11:20,530
A Ra! A Ra!

183
00:11:20,564 --> 00:11:22,466
Aigoo. Go A Ra.

184
00:11:25,168 --> 00:11:26,637
Oh. seriously.

185
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:29,206
She's really mine.

186
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:30,907
I know her!

187
00:11:34,611 --> 00:11:35,479
What, what?

188
00:11:35,512 --> 00:11:37,614
He likes Lee Yeon Hee. Lee Yeon Hee.

189
00:11:39,049 --> 00:11:40,217
Really.

190
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:43,687
-Here by the window, this person likes IU a lot. -Yes. I saw.

191
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,388
He likes IU a lot.

192
00:11:44,388 --> 00:11:46,189
-I saw that confession. -I like IU as a dongsaeng.

193
00:11:46,189 --> 00:11:49,593
This side likes Yoon Eun Hye a lot.

194
00:11:50,994 --> 00:11:52,496
Isn't that right?

195
00:11:52,996 --> 00:11:54,131
Ah, isn't that right?

196
00:11:54,164 --> 00:11:55,565
What did you say?

197
00:11:56,166 --> 00:11:57,334
Isn't that so?

198
00:11:57,401 --> 00:11:58,935
Don't say it!

199
00:11:59,603 --> 00:12:01,338
-That was a long time ago. -Stop it. stop.

200
00:12:01,638 --> 00:12:02,506
Stop it.

201
00:12:05,542 --> 00:12:07,477
I'm seriously going crazy.

202
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:08,845
-We're deciding on the partners now. -Yes.

203
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:11,214
The method is by picking their personal items.

204
00:12:11,214 --> 00:12:12,582
Oh, this was done in the past?

205
00:12:12,582 --> 00:12:17,120
The ladies, will put out their own personal item.

206
00:12:17,154 --> 00:12:18,455
The men will pick.

207
00:12:18,522 --> 00:12:21,525
-But, there are six men. - Six of us.

208
00:12:21,725 --> 00:12:23,293
Yes, you'll find out.

209
00:12:23,326 --> 00:12:23,894
Ah. for real?

210
00:12:23,927 --> 00:12:27,330
Just like this, you'll be partners with the owner of the personal item!

211
00:12:27,364 --> 00:12:31,768
-Moon Sook noona won't be here again right? - Will the men please turn and face the window?

212
00:12:41,878 --> 00:12:45,449
Ok. now you can turn around and go back to your original seats.

213
00:12:47,751 --> 00:12:48,985
Oh, what?

214
00:12:50,187 --> 00:12:51,621
Do we just pick?

215
00:12:51,955 --> 00:12:53,924
-There are six... -So why are there six?

216
00:12:54,624 --> 00:12:58,595
Among them, two are the staff's items.

217
00:12:59,663 --> 00:13:05,102
The two males who pick the staffs items. as you know, they'll become a male-male couple.

218
00:13:06,103 --> 00:13:06,970
Let's begin!

219
00:13:07,037 --> 00:13:08,972
-You lose if you don't put. something out. -Rock, paper, scissors!

220
00:13:09,206 --> 00:13:10,073
Rock, paper, scissors!

221
00:13:10,173 --> 00:13:11,074
Rock, paper, scissors!

222
00:13:11,341 --> 00:13:13,677
Paper! Paper!

223
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:14,945
Hang on.

224
00:13:15,445 --> 00:13:17,047
I'm nervous.

225
00:13:17,214 --> 00:13:19,683
Now we're all thinking alike.

226
00:13:19,916 --> 00:13:21,485
Threes, split into threes.

227
00:13:22,052 --> 00:13:22,753
Rock, paper, scissors!

228
00:13:22,886 --> 00:13:23,320
Ok!

229
00:13:23,353 --> 00:13:24,387
Ah. last!

230
00:13:25,489 --> 00:13:26,056
Rock, paper, scissors.

231
00:13:26,923 --> 00:13:27,824
Rock, paper, scissors.

232
00:13:28,091 --> 00:13:28,725
Yeah!

233
00:13:28,825 --> 00:13:30,093
-You lose if you don't put something out. -Rock, paper, scissors!

234
00:13:30,227 --> 00:13:30,927
Yes!

235
00:13:31,495 --> 00:13:32,496
Rock, paper, scissors!

236
00:13:32,696 --> 00:13:34,231
Did you see this side?

237
00:13:34,331 --> 00:13:36,066
When Suk Jin hyung was 1st, she's a bit...

238
00:13:37,267 --> 00:13:38,769
Jee2, don't worry.

239
00:13:39,536 --> 00:13:40,270
Don't worry.

240
00:13:41,004 --> 00:13:43,874
For me. I choose this.

241
00:13:46,309 --> 00:13:47,077
-Lip balm. -Lip balm!

242
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:47,844
-Hyung. -Yes?

243
00:13:48,044 --> 00:13:49,212
-It could belong to the staff. -No.

244
00:13:49,246 --> 00:13:50,714
Soo Hyang, look at Soo Hyang.

245
00:13:51,148 --> 00:13:53,316
-Soo Hyang, really? -She went like this.

246
00:13:53,483 --> 00:13:54,751
-Lip balm. -This is it, it's really correct!

247
00:13:54,751 --> 00:13:55,585
Soo Hyang went...

248
00:13:55,719 --> 00:13:57,954
Her face became red.

249
00:14:00,123 --> 00:14:01,725
Soo Hyang's face is so red.

250
00:14:02,125 --> 00:14:02,626
No.

251
00:14:02,993 --> 00:14:04,828
-Your face is so red. -Doesn't seem like it. Doesn't seem like it.

252
00:14:04,895 --> 00:14:06,029
Me, me.

253
00:14:10,834 --> 00:14:13,003
-You said you believe in fate. -Is this fate?

254
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:14,838
How can you call this fate?

255
00:14:14,838 --> 00:14:15,205
No, no.

256
00:14:15,338 --> 00:14:16,840
You can only pinch once.

257
00:14:16,973 --> 00:14:17,774
I got it, I got it.

258
00:14:17,774 --> 00:14:20,143
Five, four, three, two, one!

259
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:25,415
Ah, it's Ji Hyo's, it's Jl Hyo's.

260
00:14:25,615 --> 00:14:26,149
No.

261
00:14:26,216 --> 00:14:27,717
-Kim Jong Kook, Kim Jong Kook. -Me? Me?

262
00:14:28,385 --> 00:14:30,587
Why are you booing me?

263
00:14:30,821 --> 00:14:32,823
Boo, be together with a guy, boo.

264
00:14:34,224 --> 00:14:38,795
It won't be the sunglasses. Because most girls have very long hair, they bring hair tie.

265
00:14:41,832 --> 00:14:42,632
What do I pick?

266
00:14:42,699 --> 00:14:44,634
Hyung, it's fate.

267
00:14:45,268 --> 00:14:46,069
I choose this.

268
00:14:48,004 --> 00:14:50,640
-This is becoming nerve-wracking. -Of course.

269
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:54,611
Ah, what? Which should I pick?

270
00:14:54,978 --> 00:14:58,615
There seems to be two people here who still haven't been picked.

271
00:14:59,115 --> 00:15:00,650
Shall I pick the wig? -

272
00:15:03,019 --> 00:15:05,121
-Wig is too obvious. I have to pick from these two.

273
00:15:05,155 --> 00:15:06,723
Oh, he picked, he picked!

274
00:15:08,325 --> 00:15:11,094
-He picked this, he picked this. - It's over, it's over.

275
00:15:11,228 --> 00:15:14,231
-It's over, it's over. -It's the end, it's over.

276
00:15:16,433 --> 00:15:17,067
Hurry up!

277
00:15:18,368 --> 00:15:19,603
You can only pick once.

278
00:15:20,604 --> 00:15:22,405
-You already picked. -Jeez, you already picked, hyung.

279
00:15:22,539 --> 00:15:24,875
-Ah. this part touched... -Ehh, it didn't.

280
00:15:26,376 --> 00:15:28,211
I'm seriously going crazy.

281
00:15:29,379 --> 00:15:31,781
Anyone can see that it's a prop.

282
00:15:32,782 --> 00:15:34,050
I'm seriously going crazy.

283
00:15:34,317 --> 00:15:36,186
No, no. No!

284
00:15:36,887 --> 00:15:39,122
Ah, I'm really going crazy.

285
00:15:39,422 --> 00:15:40,123
Gary hyung.

286
00:15:42,225 --> 00:15:43,393
The wig is not bad.

287
00:15:43,593 --> 00:15:45,228
The wig is too obvious.

288
00:15:45,729 --> 00:15:47,297
-Take the wig. -Gary, the mobile phone.

289
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:48,665
The mobile phone seems like it.

290
00:15:48,665 --> 00:15:51,034
I, feel it's the mobile phone.

291
00:15:51,201 --> 00:15:52,068
I pick the wig.

292
00:15:52,202 --> 00:15:53,904
-I already said it's the mobile phone. -Hyung!

293
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:55,138
I chose what hyung left behind!

294
00:15:55,205 --> 00:15:56,706
This is reverse psychology.

295
00:15:56,706 --> 00:15:59,242
-People don't usually put down their mobile phones -Exactly!

296
00:15:59,376 --> 00:16:00,644
They wouldn't do it.

297
00:16:02,012 --> 00:16:03,914
I wanted to take the mobile phone!

298
00:16:04,381 --> 00:16:08,118
One by one, you ii ask for the owners of the items.

299
00:16:08,385 --> 00:16:11,554
If it belongs to the ladies, the ladies will confirm it.

300
00:16:11,755 --> 00:16:12,455
Ah, great.

301
00:16:13,089 --> 00:16:16,993
-Who is the owner of this soft wig? -It's definitely one of the four of them.

302
00:16:17,127 --> 00:16:19,095
Who is the owner of the wig?

303
00:16:19,195 --> 00:16:20,997
The one who will be my couple today.

304
00:16:30,206 --> 00:16:32,242
Ah, see! It's Hyo Min.

305
00:16:35,412 --> 00:16:37,247
The hair colour is the same as Homing's.

306
00:16:38,481 --> 00:16:40,317
Our writers don't wear these.

307
00:16:46,189 --> 00:16:47,924
Then oppa will call you 'Min' today.

308
00:16:48,325 --> 00:16:50,393
No, the staff should really have prepared more.

309
00:16:54,831 --> 00:16:56,132
I really have the desire today.

310
00:16:56,232 --> 00:16:57,634
That won't do. it really won't do.

311
00:16:58,735 --> 00:17:01,271
Who is the owner of this lip balm?

312
00:17:01,871 --> 00:17:03,473
-Ok. one! -Soo Hyang, Soo Hyang.

313
00:17:05,275 --> 00:17:05,976
Two!

314
00:17:08,812 --> 00:17:09,412
Three!

315
00:17:13,483 --> 00:17:14,484
It's mine.

316
00:17:21,391 --> 00:17:23,893
Hey, why do you carry around a lip balm?

317
00:17:31,334 --> 00:17:33,236
Why are you carrying around women's lip balm?

318
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:36,039
This is the law of the universe.

319
00:17:36,172 --> 00:17:37,574
Ah, this really doesn't make sense!

320
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,609
-Hey, this is seriously the law of the universe. -This is fate.

321
00:17:39,776 --> 00:17:41,011
Ah, it's really yours?

322
00:17:42,612 --> 00:17:44,914
Wow. Why do use female stuff?

323
00:17:45,048 --> 00:17:46,683
My lips are very precious.

324
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:48,718
You use the same one I do.

325
00:17:48,818 --> 00:17:50,487
Ah. it really doesn't make sense.

326
00:17:51,154 --> 00:17:52,689
Ah, they're going one by one.

327
00:17:53,023 --> 00:17:55,325
Ah, I'm really unlucky, really!

328
00:17:55,425 --> 00:17:57,093
Suk Jin hyung, please stand over here.

329
00:17:57,694 --> 00:18:00,463
-Wow, l'm seriously unlucky, out of the six. - Who told you to pick that?

330
00:18:00,497 --> 00:18:01,498
Ah, I'm seriously...

331
00:18:01,631 --> 00:18:05,735
Although, it looks like Suk Jin hyung's extremely unlucky but it's very lucky for Running Man as a whole.

332
00:18:07,003 --> 00:18:08,438
This is just great.

333
00:18:09,973 --> 00:18:11,408
This should be a woman's right?

334
00:18:12,242 --> 00:18:13,209
Jong Kookie!

335
00:18:14,177 --> 00:18:17,180
-The owner of this hair tie, who is it? -Ok.

336
00:18:17,213 --> 00:18:18,715
The owner of the hair tie.

337
00:18:19,582 --> 00:18:20,917
Oh, maybe Eun Hye is coming?

338
00:18:21,951 --> 00:18:24,020
Ah really, didn't I tell you not to say it?

339
00:18:24,154 --> 00:18:25,855
It is possible. You throw it away?

340
00:18:26,156 --> 00:18:27,624
Don't talk about it.

341
00:18:27,724 --> 00:18:28,625
I got it, I got it.

342
00:18:28,725 --> 00:18:30,493
-I just won't say it then. -All, seriously.

343
00:18:31,694 --> 00:18:33,797
Ok, Kim Jong Kook will begin.

344
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:34,731
Ok, one!

345
00:18:37,467 --> 00:18:38,234
Two!

346
00:18:41,337 --> 00:18:41,871
Three!

347
00:18:52,115 --> 00:18:52,849
Really?

348
00:18:53,817 --> 00:18:54,751
For real?

349
00:18:55,685 --> 00:18:56,686
Hey, really?

350
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:58,188
Daebak.

351
00:18:59,622 --> 00:19:00,824
Did everyone know?

352
00:19:01,124 --> 00:19:01,925
Really!

353
00:19:04,394 --> 00:19:05,395
It doesn't make sense.

354
00:19:09,299 --> 00:19:10,667
-Is this real? -Is it for real?

355
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:11,134
Yes.

356
00:19:11,167 --> 00:19:12,936
Really, is it really Miss A Ra's?

357
00:19:12,969 --> 00:19:14,070
It's really yours?

358
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:15,038
It's mine.

359
00:19:25,348 --> 00:19:27,984
This is why queen and king can't meet.

360
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,822
That's why the kings are all lonely.

361
00:19:38,094 --> 00:19:40,597
Now there are two girls and three men left.

362
00:19:41,331 --> 00:19:41,731
Ok.

363
00:19:42,065 --> 00:19:43,233
This side is heaven!

364
00:19:43,299 --> 00:19:43,666
Yes.

365
00:19:44,167 --> 00:19:45,735
That side is hell,

366
00:19:47,704 --> 00:19:49,105
his here is paradise.

367
00:19:49,372 --> 00:19:51,441
-Even his clothes are red. -It's so amazing.

368
00:19:51,774 --> 00:19:54,377
The owner of this cactus tonic, who is it?

369
00:19:54,511 --> 00:19:56,312
Ah Haha, do it coolly.

370
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:59,215
'This tonic, who is the owner?'

371
00:20:05,388 --> 00:20:08,191
The controller of tonic!

372
00:20:14,197 --> 00:20:15,865
It's me.

373
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:18,635
What?

374
00:20:20,103 --> 00:20:21,404
It's me.

375
00:20:31,881 --> 00:20:36,452
Hey! If you are not feeling well then go back. Don't try too hard.

376
00:20:36,452 --> 00:20:40,123
-It's to give you strength!&-Ji Hyo. it's alright.

377
00:20:46,229 --> 00:20:52,035
For Gwang Soo and I, one will go to heaven while the others goes to hell.

378
00:20:52,035 --> 00:20:57,540
Take turns to ask, "is this right?" and then wait.

379
00:21:05,048 --> 00:21:08,851
The dazzling...

380
00:21:09,852 --> 00:21:11,321
What are you doing?

381
00:21:11,387 --> 00:21:13,156
What are you going to say?

382
00:21:13,189 --> 00:21:14,791
The dazzling person..

383
00:21:16,926 --> 00:21:17,827
Oh, so frustrating.

384
00:21:17,827 --> 00:21:18,528
Sorry.

385
00:21:18,595 --> 00:21:21,431
Oh. this is so frustrating.

386
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,336
The dazzling person!

387
00:21:31,674 --> 00:21:33,610
When I turned on the phone and took a look.

388
00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:36,913
There is a very cute cat, just like you.

389
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:39,749
The camera director likes cats very much.

390
00:21:39,749 --> 00:21:41,284
I believe in fate.

391
00:21:41,451 --> 00:21:42,485
I'll be waiting.

392
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:51,594
Please please please? 1,2,3.

393
00:21:52,595 --> 00:21:53,730
3!

394
00:22:15,051 --> 00:22:17,287
What's the matter between you and me!

395
00:22:17,287 --> 00:22:20,223
I said it in the beginning right! Fee/, feel, cross!

396
00:22:20,223 --> 00:22:23,326
I said it right! Feel, feel, cross!

397
00:22:25,795 --> 00:22:27,397
-Really? -How can this happen?

398
00:22:34,404 --> 00:22:35,938
Yes. this is mine.

399
00:22:35,938 --> 00:22:37,073
-It's yours? -Yes.

400
00:22:37,073 --> 00:22:38,541
But how die! it really end up like that?

401
00:22:38,541 --> 00:22:40,543
I originally intended to take that.

402
00:22:40,543 --> 00:22:41,978
What is it?

403
00:22:41,978 --> 00:22:43,780
You match each other well.

404
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:47,684
The current team will last till the end without any changes.

405
00:22:47,884 --> 00:22:50,320
There won't be any changes?

406
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:53,823
No changes at all? it will be more interesting with some changes!

407
00:22:53,823 --> 00:22:58,294
These two people cannot stay together, it's awkward.

408
00:22:58,294 --> 00:23:01,597
Hyung, when we linked arms he kept moving his hand like this.

409
00:23:02,765 --> 00:23:04,600
Why?

410
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:08,304
Today is a Meeting Race.

411
00:23:08,304 --> 00:23:12,375
Go to every mission location and complete the couple games,

412
00:23:12,375 --> 00:23:18,348
The top 3 couples will receive a piece of information useful for the final mission through a phone call.

413
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:26,389
Where to? Is it there?

414
00:23:26,389 --> 00:23:28,124
This way.

415
00:23:29,826 --> 00:23:32,195
They must be really happy.

416
00:23:33,696 --> 00:23:36,199
-The first mission for the Meeting Race. -Yes, yes.

417
00:23:36,199 --> 00:23:39,602
Cross the stone bridge from here.

418
00:23:39,802 --> 00:23:44,974
When you find the Running Man banner, you will receive more instructions.

419
00:23:44,974 --> 00:23:46,943
-Got it. -It's better if you set-off quickly.

420
00:23:46,976 --> 00:23:48,277
Move aside!

421
00:23:48,745 --> 00:23:51,347
Can't we go slower today?

422
00:23:54,016 --> 00:23:56,185
Hey! You two have to hold hands!

423
00:24:02,725 --> 00:24:04,427
Hyo Min, this way.

424
00:24:05,995 --> 00:24:08,931
It doesn't seem like it's this way. It doesn't seem like it.

425
00:24:10,833 --> 00:24:12,635
It's here! It's here!

426
00:24:15,004 --> 00:24:16,372
Quickly!

427
00:24:17,306 --> 00:24:18,708
Be careful.

428
00:24:28,284 --> 00:24:30,019
Camera!

429
00:24:30,019 --> 00:24:31,554
Kwon Ryol!

430
00:24:31,554 --> 00:24:33,890
Run faster, Kwon Ryol!

431
00:24:38,094 --> 00:24:40,296
Catch up quickly, Kwon Ryol!

432
00:24:47,203 --> 00:24:48,671
Ah! It's really tiring!

433
00:24:50,339 --> 00:24:52,475
Soo Hyang, you're good at running.

434
00:24:54,310 --> 00:24:56,179
We're first.

435
00:24:56,179 --> 00:24:57,680
Soo Hyang, well done,

436
00:24:58,881 --> 00:25:02,485
Barefooted youth. Couples please search for the question papers while barefooted.

437
00:25:02,485 --> 00:25:04,854
Hey, what should we do about this?

438
00:25:06,656 --> 00:25:08,324
Totally barefooted?

439
00:25:08,324 --> 00:25:09,425
Barefooted?"

440
00:25:10,026 --> 00:25:11,994
What? Even the socks?

441
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:19,469
There will be question papers inside. After you have . found it, you just need to answer the question.

442
00:25:31,147 --> 00:25:33,516
I am going crazy! Do I have to-remove the socks too?

443
00:25:33,516 --> 00:25:34,417
Yes.

444
00:25:34,851 --> 00:25:38,721
In-consideration of your partner. we will allow piggyback rides.

445
00:25:38,721 --> 00:25:39,522
Ok! Set off!

446
00:25:39,622 --> 00:25:40,423
Huh, jeez!

447
00:25:40,623 --> 00:25:41,724
Barefooted!

448
00:25:41,824 --> 00:25:43,526
Please say something reasonable!

449
00:25:47,396 --> 00:25:49,999
Soo Hyan, come up.

450
00:25:49,999 --> 00:25:51,901
Ah! It's cold!

451
00:25:56,506 --> 00:25:57,840
Ah. it's really cold.

452
00:25:58,774 --> 00:26:00,042
Soo Hyang.

453
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,616
Ah, it's cold! Wait a moment.

454
00:26:06,616 --> 00:26:09,051
Soo Hyang. wait. Wait a sec.

455
00:26:11,487 --> 00:26:14,323
I have to carry you. We have to find it quickly.

456
00:26:14,323 --> 00:26:17,493
Ah! It's prickly! It's prickly

457
00:26:17,493 --> 00:26:18,995
It's cold and prickly!

458
00:26:18,995 --> 00:26:20,129
Ah! It hurts!

459
00:26:20,129 --> 00:26:22,064
It's cold and prickly! It's cold and prickly!

460
00:26:25,768 --> 00:26:26,369
Ah! So heavy!

461
00:26:26,369 --> 00:26:27,703
Sorry sorry!

462
00:26:27,703 --> 00:26:29,071
Ah! So light!

463
00:26:32,608 --> 00:26:34,477
They are catching up! Soo Hyang, hurry!

464
00:26:37,413 --> 00:26:39,282
Ah! It's so cold!

465
00:26:39,282 --> 00:26:42,785
Can you walk like this, should I just walk?

466
00:26:44,353 --> 00:26:48,524
Ah! Ji Hyo, it's too cold! Look!

467
00:26:49,692 --> 00:26:51,227
My feet are freezing.

468
00:26:54,463 --> 00:26:55,965
There's snow, snow!

469
00:26:55,965 --> 00:26:56,999
Really,

470
00:26:56,999 --> 00:26:59,001
Let's go somewhere else.

471
00:26:59,535 --> 00:27:02,805
Ah. my feet are freezing, my feet are freezing.

472
00:27:06,375 --> 00:27:07,343
I'm really sorry.

473
00:27:07,343 --> 00:27:10,613
Sorry, we need to take a look.

474
00:27:13,082 --> 00:27:15,651
Where is it? Let's search the soy jars platform.

475
00:27:17,053 --> 00:27:18,921
Oppa, there's ice here.

476
00:27:18,921 --> 00:27:22,224
Really, there's ice here. Where is it? Look for it.

477
00:27:27,763 --> 00:27:32,568
What are you doing? Soo Hyang. what are you doing?

478
00:27:32,568 --> 00:27:33,769
What does it look like?

479
00:27:33,769 --> 00:27:37,440
You can't open it here after finding the question -paper. If you open It. it is considered a fail.

480
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,841
Yes.

481
00:27:39,842 --> 00:27:42,044
Oh. I'm alright.

482
00:27:45,848 --> 00:27:47,283
Ah! Who is it?

485
00:27:58,694 --> 00:28:01,831

-Please go to the back -Why me.

Then, Gwang Soo.

If I close my eyes.

I can see you brightly smiling.

516
00:29:34,323 --> 00:29:36,325
A happy expression.

Come over here!

521
00:29:50,706 --> 00:29:52,808
Hyo Min, I'm sorry!

522
00:29:52,808 --> 00:29:56,378
-No? -You are suffering because you didn't get a better partner.

523
00:29:56,378 --> 00:29:58,948
Today's groupings won't change, right?

524
00:29:58,948 --> 00:30:00,349
Why are you like this?

525
00:30:00,349 --> 00:30:01,817
We just started.

526
00:30:01,817 --> 00:30:03,319
Why must we stay till the end?

527
00:30:03,319 --> 00:30:07,223
-There isn't any here. I've searched everywhere -Is that so?

528
00:30:07,423 --> 00:30:09,024
I've searched everywhere.

529
00:30:09,825 --> 00:30:11,393
Oh, what a shock!

530
00:30:11,594 --> 00:30:12,094
What's wrong?

531
00:30:12,194 --> 00:30:13,729
That scared me!

532
00:30:13,729 --> 00:30:14,630
Where is it?

533
00:30:15,564 --> 00:30:16,132
That scared me!

534
00:30:16,232 --> 00:30:16,832
What's wrong?

535
00:30:17,533 --> 00:30:19,034
That scared me!

536
00:30:19,335 --> 00:30:20,369
-Did you find ft? -No.

537
00:30:20,970 --> 00:30:22,138
Oh, because of this?

538
00:30:22,905 --> 00:30:24,573
-You must have been frightened. -Sorry.

539
00:30:24,774 --> 00:30:25,374
It's fine.

540
00:30:25,508 --> 00:30:26,509
It was too scary.

541
00:30:26,575 --> 00:30:29,111
Oh, I thought you had found it.

542
00:30:29,478 --> 00:30:30,646
Oppa, where is it?

543
00:30:30,813 --> 00:30:31,247
Oh!

544
00:30:31,313 --> 00:30:32,381
-Where? -it's here!

545
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:33,549
-Where? -Here.

546
00:30:34,016 --> 00:30:35,417
How do you expect us to find this?!

547
00:30:35,518 --> 00:30:37,686
This is too hard.

548
00:30:38,621 --> 00:30:39,421
Oppa is useful right?

549
00:30:39,588 --> 00:30:42,291
Oppa, then are you good at quizzes?

550
00:30:42,424 --> 00:30:43,125
Quiz?

551
00:30:43,492 --> 00:30:44,226
I'm sorry.

552
00:30:48,731 --> 00:30:49,365
Please wait for a while.

553
00:30:49,465 --> 00:30:49,965
Yeah.

554
00:30:50,366 --> 00:30:51,167
Oppa will go first.

555
00:30:51,233 --> 00:30:51,500
All right.

556
00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:56,472
What is the 1988.Summer Olympics

557
00:30:56,572 --> 00:30:56,972
Yeah.

558
00:30:57,139 --> 00:30:58,808
Official mascot's name?

559
00:30:58,974 --> 00:31:00,075
Oh my god.

560
00:31:00,743 --> 00:31:02,578
Did you think I would say Gaedori?

561
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,982
-Hyo Min. this is definite. -Hyo Min.

562
00:31:07,049 --> 00:31:07,683
Is it easy?

563
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:08,584
Very easy.

564
00:31:10,753 --> 00:31:11,954
Ah, our Hyodori.

565
00:31:13,823 --> 00:31:17,126
-In Korea's 1988 Olympic Summer games, -Ah, our Hyodori.

566
00:31:17,293 --> 00:31:19,895
What is the name of the official mascot?

567
00:31:21,263 --> 00:31:22,631
Haha, I got it.

568
00:31:22,631 --> 00:31:24,633
I can't go back and say it right? I have to say it here?

569
00:31:24,733 --> 00:31:26,802
Say it softly here.

570
00:31:27,269 --> 00:31:28,037
Podori.

571
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:31,707
Please go back.

572
00:31:33,375 --> 00:31:34,944
-Do you know? -I almost didn't know it.

573
00:31:34,944 --> 00:31:36,478
Had I been born later...

574
00:31:36,612 --> 00:31:38,848
Yeah, you were born in '88 right?

575
00:31:38,848 --> 00:31:41,717
Although I was born in '89. but it was talked about then. too.

576
00:31:42,618 --> 00:31:43,819
You knew right?

577
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:45,054
Then we'll go now.

578
00:31:45,087 --> 00:31:46,755
Hyo Min. please say it first.

579
00:31:48,023 --> 00:31:49,325
1. 2 .3.

580
00:31:49,625 --> 00:31:52,094
Podori!

581
00:31:54,864 --> 00:31:55,831
Hey. you Hyodol!

582
00:31:57,466 --> 00:31:58,834
Hodori, it's Hodori!

583
00:31:59,501 --> 00:32:01,036
What did I say? Podori?

584
00:32:01,871 --> 00:32:02,872
It's because...

585
00:32:02,938 --> 00:32:06,242
It's because the weather is too cold today so her lips were stuck together.

586
00:32:08,844 --> 00:32:09,478
it's too cold.

587
00:32:10,713 --> 00:32:11,914
So it's like that.

588
00:32:11,947 --> 00:32:16,252
No, her lips were stuck because of the cold.

589
00:32:20,890 --> 00:32:24,693
Korea's 1960 family planning slogan,

590
00:32:24,793 --> 00:32:28,631
"If you blindly reproduce" iv fiats the next line?

591
00:32:31,834 --> 00:32:34,169
Smoothly, smoothly, the child will grow...

592
00:32:35,838 --> 00:32:37,339
What should I do...

593
00:32:38,307 --> 00:32:40,309
What's wrong? Who bullied you?

594
00:32:40,409 --> 00:32:42,811
He did? All right I'll take care of this.

595
00:32:43,812 --> 00:32:47,716
-I don't know about the 1960s. -I'll say the front line and please tell me the end.

596
00:32:47,716 --> 00:32:49,618
If you blindly reproduce.

597
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:51,420
You will have an endless number of babies.

598
00:32:53,422 --> 00:32:54,223
That's not it?

599
00:32:54,323 --> 00:32:55,124
And Hyo Min?

600
00:32:55,224 --> 00:32:57,426
Smoothly, smoothly, the child will grow.

601
00:32:58,894 --> 00:33:01,830
That saying didn't exist in the 60s!

602
00:33:02,364 --> 00:33:03,899
You won't escape becoming a beggar!

603
00:33:09,405 --> 00:33:10,272
Notebook!

604
00:33:11,273 --> 00:33:12,274
Rogue.

605
00:33:13,142 --> 00:33:14,710
The correct answer is Rouge.

606
00:33:16,545 --> 00:33:17,413
Can't do that?

607
00:33:22,551 --> 00:33:24,019
Over there.

608
00:33:25,254 --> 00:33:26,755
Soo Hyang, over there.

609
00:33:28,824 --> 00:33:30,426
Ah, I'm going crazy.

610
00:33:31,393 --> 00:33:33,629
Soo Hyang, come over here.

611
00:33:33,729 --> 00:33:34,930
Step on the rocks.

612
00:33:44,473 --> 00:33:45,474
Who is going first?

613
00:33:45,674 --> 00:33:47,176
-Oppa can go first. -I'll go first.

614
00:33:49,812 --> 00:33:51,046
We'll start now.

615
00:33:51,747 --> 00:33:59,955
This, which is becoming popular again since the 80s, is a dance where one switches feet am I drags them on the ground.

616
00:34:00,089 --> 00:34:01,190
What dance is this?

617
00:34:01,223 --> 00:34:01,924
Shuffle.

618
00:34:01,924 --> 00:34:02,925
Shuffle dance.

619
00:34:03,225 --> 00:34:04,593
Please go Bach.

620
00:34:04,693 --> 00:34:05,794
It's my turn?

621
00:34:06,528 --> 00:34:08,130
Soo Hyang, it's not hard.

622
00:34:08,364 --> 00:34:09,498
Fighting, Soo Hyang!

623
00:34:09,765 --> 00:34:11,266
Soo Hyang. you can do it!

624
00:34:11,333 --> 00:34:16,505
The name of the dance where one switches feet and drags them on the ground?

625
00:34:17,272 --> 00:34:19,408
-Where do I answer? -At the camera.

626
00:34:19,808 --> 00:34:21,010
Shuffle dance.

627
00:34:21,577 --> 00:34:22,945
Please go back.

628
00:34:23,245 --> 00:34:24,713
Soo Hyang is incorrect right?

629
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:27,483
Please say out the answers when I say 1,2,3.

630
00:34:27,850 --> 00:34:29,118
1. 2. 3

631
00:34:29,218 --> 00:34:30,185
Shuffle dance.

632
00:34:30,319 --> 00:34:31,053
Shuffle dance.

633
00:34:31,387 --> 00:34:32,254
Correct.

634
00:34:39,328 --> 00:34:40,229
We did it.

635
00:34:42,131 --> 00:34:43,866
We did it! It's the shuffle!

636
00:34:43,899 --> 00:34:45,768
-Try the shuffle dance. -Why should I?

637
00:34:45,834 --> 00:34:47,703
You just did anyway!

638
00:34:48,103 --> 00:34:48,871
Where do we go?

639
00:34:48,904 --> 00:34:53,842
The first who pass gets 30 seconds of the phone call hint.

640
00:34:54,443 --> 00:34:55,544
Please go to the telephone booth.

641
00:34:55,577 --> 00:34:56,145
Yeah.

642
00:34:57,513 --> 00:34:59,081
That oppa is the best.

643
00:35:00,315 --> 00:35:01,817
We're the first.

644
00:35:10,492 --> 00:35:11,794
Soo Hyang, you listen.

645
00:35:12,694 --> 00:35:15,998
Every time the mission ends, obstruct the Running Men from the hint.

646
00:35:22,938 --> 00:35:27,976
The fast mission of the meeting race is the battle of the strongest couple.

647
00:35:28,310 --> 00:35:32,414
Rip off each other's name tags, even if one person is left, the team still wins.

648
00:35:32,514 --> 00:35:33,849
Are there any questions?

649
00:35:33,949 --> 00:35:37,086
Every time the mission ends, obstruct the Running Men from the hint.

650
00:35:37,152 --> 00:35:39,054
Where do we go. now?

651
00:35:39,321 --> 00:35:42,991
I'll repeat the next location when we get off the phone.

652
00:35:43,125 --> 00:35:45,294
Really? We can just go out from here?

653
00:35:45,327 --> 00:35:47,229
Yes just go out from here.

654
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:49,031
What did he say?

655
00:35:49,465 --> 00:35:51,600
Battle of the strongest... They hung up.

656
00:35:55,204 --> 00:35:55,804
What?

657
00:35:56,105 --> 00:35:58,474
It's the battle of the strongest.

658
00:35:58,607 --> 00:35:59,441
So,

659
00:35:59,541 --> 00:36:01,043
This Running Man is...

660
00:36:01,143 --> 00:36:02,644
-Everyone? -Yeah, everyone.

661
00:36:02,644 --> 00:36:04,446
-Battle of strengths? -Yes, correct.

662
00:36:12,121 --> 00:36:13,188
Oppa, I'll go.

663
00:36:19,595 --> 00:36:22,431
The fast mission of the meeting race is the battle of the strongest couple.

664
00:36:22,531 --> 00:36:27,102
Tear off each other's name tags, even if one person is left the team still wins.

665
00:36:27,302 --> 00:36:29,304
We have to tear off all the name tags?

666
00:36:29,538 --> 00:36:30,472
Yes.

667
00:36:36,979 --> 00:36:37,713
We...

668
00:36:37,713 --> 00:36:39,448
-You and I together. -Yes.

669
00:36:39,715 --> 00:36:42,017
We're a couple so we must fight the others.

670
00:36:42,050 --> 00:36:43,352
-You and I together? -Yeah.

671
00:36:55,464 --> 00:36:58,834
Head to the observatory beside Jang Yeong Sil Science Museum and find the Running Man banner.

672
00:36:59,034 --> 00:36:59,635
All right.

673
00:37:00,202 --> 00:37:02,237
This is oppa's personal VJ?

674
00:37:03,338 --> 00:37:05,507
-He went missing just now. -Didn't see you just now.

675
00:37:05,541 --> 00:37:06,708
I see you on TV often.

676
00:37:06,909 --> 00:37:08,110
I'm your fan!

677
00:37:12,748 --> 00:37:13,949
You got it right?

678
00:37:14,116 --> 00:37:15,184
You still haven't found one?

679
00:37:16,251 --> 00:37:17,753
Hyo Min, I thought that was your house.

680
00:37:18,153 --> 00:37:19,388
We only found one.

681
00:37:19,521 --> 00:37:20,589
We only found one!

682
00:37:21,390 --> 00:37:24,126
-Hyo Min, you still haven't been able to go? -You just need to find one.

683
00:37:25,994 --> 00:37:27,396
Soo Hyang. what die! they say just now?

684
00:37:27,429 --> 00:37:28,830
They said to tear off name tags?

685
00:37:28,931 --> 00:37:30,766
Yes. that's right.

686
00:37:30,899 --> 00:37:32,000
For the last race.

687
00:37:32,568 --> 00:37:33,569
Nothing else?

688
00:37:33,602 --> 00:37:34,203
Yes.

689
00:37:38,373 --> 00:37:40,642
The mission usually isn't that simple.

690
00:37:40,842 --> 00:37:43,512
It can't be just ripping name tags.

691
00:37:43,812 --> 00:37:45,414
There should be a spy.

692
00:37:45,781 --> 00:37:47,216
It's a spy game?

693
00:37:49,251 --> 00:37:53,222
A Ra, you aren't the spy, right?

694
00:37:59,294 --> 00:38:01,930
Don't they usually tell spies beforehand?

695
00:38:02,097 --> 00:38:06,134
If you're here for the first time, they tell you beforehand.

696
00:38:06,735 --> 00:38:07,703
The spy?

697
00:38:08,437 --> 00:38:09,738
From your facial expression...

698
00:38:10,572 --> 00:38:12,107
From your facial expression...

699
00:38:14,543 --> 00:38:15,944
I don't think you are!

700
00:38:16,578 --> 00:38:18,113
You look like you really don't know anything.

701
00:38:18,513 --> 00:38:20,616
-I really don't know anything. - You really don't know anything.

702
00:38:29,825 --> 00:38:32,494
Then what is it today? There's obviously something...

703
00:38:39,768 --> 00:38:40,769
Oh, we arrived.

704
00:38:41,036 --> 00:38:42,137
Over there.

705
00:38:43,538 --> 00:38:44,306
Where?

706
00:38:45,907 --> 00:38:47,442
-Just go in from the entrance there. -Yes, yes.

707
00:38:48,877 --> 00:38:50,178
We're the first.

708
00:38:50,379 --> 00:38:51,813
There isn't anyone else right?

709
00:39:01,123 --> 00:39:01,823
What?

710
00:39:04,026 --> 00:39:05,027
Excuse me.

711
00:39:05,994 --> 00:39:07,195
I'll take your temperature.

712
00:39:10,632 --> 00:39:11,733
36.2 degrees.

713
00:39:11,933 --> 00:39:12,968
It's normal right?

714
00:39:15,904 --> 00:39:16,972
36.0 degrees.

715
00:39:17,873 --> 00:39:19,274
Please walk straight ahead.

716
00:39:20,008 --> 00:39:20,909
Oh, this...

717
00:39:27,549 --> 00:39:29,017
I don't Clare to look down.

718
00:39:29,785 --> 00:39:31,320
Dong Wan, why are you here?

719
00:39:32,454 --> 00:39:33,455
What's this?

720
00:39:37,726 --> 00:39:39,094
Do we start now?

721
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,601
This is no joke.

722
00:39:46,768 --> 00:39:47,969
London Night.

723
00:40:04,886 --> 00:40:06,288
Oppa's dancing is good.

724
00:40:15,163 --> 00:40:17,299
Ah. it's really tacky.

725
00:40:17,966 --> 00:40:19,901
Ah. really tacky.

726
00:40:25,006 --> 00:40:27,242
Wow!

727
00:40:28,477 --> 00:40:31,680
Yoo Jae Suk, Yoo Jae Suk.

728
00:40:33,014 --> 00:40:34,483
Dance with me. Soo Hyang.

729
00:40:37,486 --> 00:40:39,221
We have to dance like this.

730
00:40:51,266 --> 00:40:52,300
What is it?

731
00:40:54,936 --> 00:40:57,172
36.2 degrees.

732
00:40:58,807 --> 00:41:00,642
36.0 degrees.

733
00:41:02,344 --> 00:41:04,413
I was dancing excitedly yet it fell.

734
00:41:04,546 --> 00:41:06,515
Music, start!

735
00:41:16,024 --> 00:41:17,325
Let go of me. Let go!

736
00:41:17,325 --> 00:41:20,095
Hey, Jl Hyo! Let go of me!

737
00:41:26,401 --> 00:41:28,837
-Ok. you have to dance, dance. -This is dancing.

738
00:41:28,837 --> 00:41:32,073
This isn't dance, you have to dance all the way.

739
00:41:42,884 --> 00:41:46,822
Ah, it's hot! Ah, it's hot!

740
00:41:48,089 --> 00:41:50,125
You have to dance, dance.

741
00:41:51,793 --> 00:41:53,094
Ok.

742
00:41:53,094 --> 00:41:54,429
We did it all.

743
00:41:57,532 --> 00:41:59,701
36.0 degrees.

744
00:42:03,672 --> 00:42:05,974
36.1 degrees.

745
00:42:06,975 --> 00:42:12,414
But oppa, you really looks like someone coming out of some 70s catalogue.

746
00:42:12,414 --> 00:42:13,181
It's not a joke.

747
00:42:13,181 --> 00:42:14,749
It's not a joke, oppa!

748
00:42:14,749 --> 00:42:15,951
This confidence is seriously not a joke.

749
00:42:15,951 --> 00:42:19,754
No. he's someone who always think he's popular.

750
00:42:20,956 --> 00:42:22,624
Oppa. there was this one.

751
00:42:22,624 --> 00:42:23,925
-What? -This, this.

752
00:42:25,794 --> 00:42:26,728
This is Jong Kook's right?

753
00:42:26,728 --> 00:42:28,497
-Hey, this... -Jong Kook.

754
00:42:30,832 --> 00:42:32,434
They're here, they're here.

755
00:42:32,434 --> 00:42:35,170
Hyung, look. A Ra. look down.

756
00:42:36,838 --> 00:42:37,973
Wow!

757
00:42:37,973 --> 00:42:39,307
-What, she's not scared? -It's jjang!

758
00:42:39,307 --> 00:42:41,409
A Ra, how is it, A Ra?

759
00:42:41,409 --> 00:42:42,777
Oh, very good!

760
00:42:42,777 --> 00:42:44,112
It's very good, A Ra?

761
00:42:44,112 --> 00:42:46,581
Soo Hyang says she dances the Roly Poly dance very well.

762
00:42:52,954 --> 00:42:56,091
-Soo Hyang, Soo Hyang. -It starts now, it starts now.

763
00:42:57,425 --> 00:42:59,094
What?

764
00:43:00,128 --> 00:43:02,397
Soo Hyang, how old did you say you are this year?

765
00:43:02,430 --> 00:43:03,565
Why, why?

766
00:43:03,565 --> 00:43:04,933
She's born in 1990.

767
00:43:04,966 --> 00:43:06,501
She has a retro style.

768
00:43:06,535 --> 00:43:08,837
She looks like someone from the past.

769
00:43:08,870 --> 00:43:10,305
There's nothing else.

770
00:43:10,305 --> 00:43:12,007
Look below, take a look.

771
00:43:19,548 --> 00:43:21,283
Should we do 'Friends Forever'?

772
00:43:21,283 --> 00:43:22,584
Fighting.

773
00:43:24,986 --> 00:43:27,389
How can we raise our temperature with this?

774
00:43:27,389 --> 00:43:30,325
She's similar to me, seems similar.

775
00:43:33,595 --> 00:43:34,629
Wow, this is it.

776
00:43:36,531 --> 00:43:37,999
A Ra, show your dance!

777
00:43:37,999 --> 00:43:39,501
I'm starting!

778
00:43:42,504 --> 00:43:43,905
Go A Ra!

779
00:43:48,176 --> 00:43:51,313
Heat it up!

780
00:43:56,918 --> 00:43:59,554
Heat it up!

781
00:44:00,822 --> 00:44:01,723
Heat it!

782
00:44:01,723 --> 00:44:03,625
Oh. you can't do this, you can't do this.

783
00:44:03,625 --> 00:44:04,793
Heat it!

784
00:44:05,594 --> 00:44:06,828
Heat it!

785
00:44:08,630 --> 00:44:10,999
-Hey, you guys stop it. -Oppa, heat it up like this.

786
00:44:10,999 --> 00:44:11,866
Ok.

787
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:13,134
Heat it up!

788
00:44:13,134 --> 00:44:14,869
We have to pump it up.

789
00:44:14,869 --> 00:44:16,538
Heat it up7 heat it!

790
00:44:22,077 --> 00:44:22,744
Heat it up!

791
00:44:22,777 --> 00:44:25,547
Yeah, Go A Ra!

792
00:44:26,648 --> 00:44:28,683
A happy heart.

793
00:44:30,552 --> 00:44:32,954
Being happy, being happy.

794
00:44:35,924 --> 00:44:37,125
Hey, it's tiring, it's tiring.

795
00:44:37,125 --> 00:44:38,193
Yeah.

796
00:44:39,294 --> 00:44:40,996
-Hurry, hurry. -It's really daebak.

797
00:44:40,996 --> 00:44:42,130
Hey, check it out.

798
00:44:42,130 --> 00:44:43,565
-Seems like it went up. -Hurry.

799
00:44:43,565 --> 00:44:44,499
Go A Ra's the best.

800
00:44:44,499 --> 00:44:46,768
-Measure it quickly before it goes down -How much will it increase?

801
00:44:47,002 --> 00:44:48,536
Soo Hyang...

802
00:44:48,536 --> 00:44:51,272
Soo Hyang is not sure if she's caught.

803
00:44:51,973 --> 00:44:56,378
When Go A Ra was dancing at first, Soo Hyang said, "it's similar to mine."

804
00:44:57,045 --> 00:45:00,582
A little later after watching, "She's dancing for real."

805
00:45:01,282 --> 00:45:02,751
"She's similar to me."

806
00:45:03,084 --> 00:45:05,954
A Ra is a good dancer, Soo Hyang,

807
00:45:06,955 --> 00:45:08,423
What are we doing?

808
00:45:09,591 --> 00:45:10,892
What are you doing?

809
00:45:13,294 --> 00:45:15,130
36.1 degrees.

810
00:45:15,397 --> 00:45:16,965
I'm having a fever?

811
00:45:17,832 --> 00:45:18,967
Aigoo, come quickly.

812
00:45:22,470 --> 00:45:23,638
They're here, they're here.

813
00:45:23,638 --> 00:45:25,106
Look there, took there.

814
00:45:25,106 --> 00:45:26,274
Why, why?

815
00:45:29,010 --> 00:45:29,678
What's this?

816
00:45:29,678 --> 00:45:30,979
Done, you've passed the first round!

817
00:45:30,979 --> 00:45:31,913
Why, why?

818
00:45:32,447 --> 00:45:33,848
You have to raise your temperature.

819
00:45:36,384 --> 00:45:37,352
No...

820
00:45:40,388 --> 00:45:41,890
We have to raise our temperature by 1 degree.

821
00:45:41,890 --> 00:45:44,125
If it raises by 1 degree, would I have to go to the hospital?

822
00:45:45,026 --> 00:45:46,327
Just come!

823
00:45:46,327 --> 00:45:48,029
Why are you whining the whole time?

824
00:45:49,230 --> 00:45:52,000
Ah, this kid's whining isn't a joke!

825
00:45:52,834 --> 00:45:54,636
-It's not a joke. -Why are you like this?

826
00:45:54,636 --> 00:45:56,671
It's abnormal.

827
00:45:56,671 --> 00:45:59,974
Hyung, the Olympic mascot is Podori, Podori.

828
00:46:00,775 --> 00:46:02,410
What, is it the police?

829
00:46:02,410 --> 00:46:04,212
It's the police's Podori!

830
00:46:05,213 --> 00:46:06,481
Aigoo.

831
00:46:07,148 --> 00:46:09,284
Good, it's interesting, it's fun.

832
00:46:09,617 --> 00:46:11,753
The sky became dark while we danced.

833
00:46:22,464 --> 00:46:25,066
Feet, feet. Lift your feet, lift your feet.

834
00:46:25,967 --> 00:46:28,369
Hey, there's no time to do this!

835
00:46:28,369 --> 00:46:30,839
Now isn't the time to do this dance!

836
00:46:30,839 --> 00:46:31,740
Hyo Min!

837
00:46:31,740 --> 00:46:34,242
A bit more, more! Hyo Min!

838
00:46:36,211 --> 00:46:37,345
Pump it, pump it up!

839
00:46:37,412 --> 00:46:38,613
You can't stop, you can't!

840
00:46:39,748 --> 00:46:42,884
Hyo-dol, now's not the time to be like this!

841
00:46:51,326 --> 00:46:53,027
Homing's no joke.

842
00:46:53,027 --> 00:46:54,629
- She 's truly Hyo Min. - Hey, let''s wrap this up!

843
00:46:54,963 --> 00:46:56,431
What are you doing?

844
00:46:56,431 --> 00:46:59,134
Let's finish it up in one go. one go!

845
00:47:00,268 --> 00:47:03,071
-I don't know, I don't know. - Hyung, hyung.

846
00:47:03,071 --> 00:47:06,808
- I'm going to go crazy! - Let's jump.

847
00:47:13,615 --> 00:47:14,883
Our hearts seemed to have stopped?

848
00:47:14,883 --> 00:47:16,785
How much will it truly increase?

849
00:47:16,785 --> 00:47:18,753
36.2 degrees.

850
00:47:18,953 --> 00:47:22,524
He wore a hat to dance so why didn't it rise?

851
00:47:22,891 --> 00:47:24,292
36.1 degrees.

852
00:47:24,292 --> 00:47:25,994
Mr Gary's body temperature didn't increase.

853
00:47:25,994 --> 00:47:27,428
Miss Homing's body temperature increased by 0.1 degrees.

854
00:47:27,428 --> 00:47:29,931
So how much more exactly do we have to do? Why again..

855
00:47:29,931 --> 00:47:31,399
Do you want to know how much. Hyo Min?

856
00:47:31,399 --> 00:47:33,268
if you want to know how much, watch the show.

857
00:47:33,902 --> 00:47:35,670
Watch how much we did it.

858
00:47:35,837 --> 00:47:39,374
- We danced, danced so vigorously now. - It's not a joke.

859
00:47:41,176 --> 00:47:43,945
Ah, shall we see Soo Hyang's sexy dance?

860
00:47:43,945 --> 00:47:46,014
The sexy dance her boss tried to prevent at all costs.

861
00:47:46,815 --> 00:47:48,283
The anticipated sexy dance.

862
00:47:48,917 --> 00:47:49,751
Oh. sexy!

863
00:47:49,751 --> 00:47:52,287
Soo Hyang, be sexy.

864
00:47:57,826 --> 00:47:59,494
Soo Hyang, be sexy.

865
00:48:01,696 --> 00:48:03,531
That's right, Soo Hyang!

866
00:48:04,399 --> 00:48:05,800
What's this?

867
00:48:07,001 --> 00:48:08,570
A bit more!

868
00:48:08,603 --> 00:48:10,405
Isn't this sexy?

869
00:48:11,973 --> 00:48:13,374
Im Soo Hyang!

870
00:48:13,374 --> 00:48:15,443
How is this sexy?

871
00:48:17,345 --> 00:48:19,047
Soo Hyang, more!

872
00:48:20,615 --> 00:48:21,950
Soo Hyang, more!

873
00:48:25,420 --> 00:48:26,354
Hey!

874
00:48:27,188 --> 00:48:31,326
- Ah, how is that sexy? - What sort of moves are those now?

875
00:48:31,326 --> 00:48:33,294
That's just a delicate dance.

876
00:48:33,294 --> 00:48:35,797
Ah. I'm seriously going crazy, really.

877
00:48:35,797 --> 00:48:38,399
Comparing it to food, her dance is like the bean paste soup.

878
00:48:40,468 --> 00:48:41,870
36.4 degrees.

879
00:48:41,870 --> 00:48:44,505
I had to learn traditional dance when I acted in 'New Gisaeng Story'.

880
00:48:44,505 --> 00:48:46,741
Oh, this my first time seeing such a tacky dance.

881
00:48:46,741 --> 00:48:47,809
Didn't you learn how to dance?

882
00:48:47,809 --> 00:48:48,943
36.5 degrees.

883
00:48:48,943 --> 00:48:51,246
I really haven't danced much!

884
00:48:51,779 --> 00:48:54,048
- My clothes, that's why my clothes... - We'll reveal the results!

885
00:48:54,482 --> 00:48:57,552
Yoo Jae Suh hod an increase of 0.2 degrees after dancing.

886
00:48:57,585 --> 00:49:00,121
Im Soo Hyang has a whole 0.5 degree increase.

887
00:49:00,188 --> 00:49:01,256
I got it.

888
00:49:01,256 --> 00:49:03,524
It increased because you were embarrassed.

889
00:49:06,527 --> 00:49:07,996
It's because you were embarrassed!

890
00:49:07,996 --> 00:49:09,163
You felt embarrassed right?

891
00:49:09,163 --> 00:49:11,499
Soo Hyang, get up quickly, that's it.

892
00:49:11,499 --> 00:49:13,167
Soo Hyang, come quickly, that's it.

893
00:49:13,167 --> 00:49:14,936
Soo Hyang, it's because you were embarrassed.

894
00:49:16,471 --> 00:49:18,206
Every Night?

895
00:49:27,448 --> 00:49:29,918
Hyung, enjoy it as much as possible!

896
00:49:38,693 --> 00:49:39,928
Ah man, so tiring!

897
00:49:39,928 --> 00:49:43,398
You have to see it to know,

898
00:49:50,638 --> 00:49:52,073
aise it.

899
00:50:01,316 --> 00:50:02,483
Ah, what to do?

900
00:50:12,527 --> 00:50:14,095
Measure it quickly, quickly.

901
00:50:17,899 --> 00:50:18,633
36.8 degrees.

902
00:50:18,733 --> 00:50:19,300
Oh!

903
00:50:19,934 --> 00:50:20,635
Wow!

904
00:50:22,370 --> 00:50:23,404
-Do they pass? -Huh?

906
00:50:25,373 --> 00:50:26,074
Oh!

907
00:50:27,141 --> 00:50:28,076
Do they pass?

908
00:50:28,376 --> 00:50:29,043
Did we succeed?

909
00:50:29,277 --> 00:50:31,746
-A total Increase of 1.2 degrees -Wow!

910
00:50:34,282 --> 00:50:36,985
Wow! Wow, today's really...

911
00:50:37,318 --> 00:50:40,154
May the world know that the Easy Brothers' time has come!

912
00:50:40,488 --> 00:50:41,889
-Ah, it's our time! -Feel!

913
00:50:41,923 --> 00:50:42,724
Feel!

914
00:50:42,824 --> 00:50:43,725
Cross!

915
00:50:45,226 --> 00:50:46,394
Let's dance together.

916
00:50:46,527 --> 00:50:47,795
Together, together.

917
00:50:47,895 --> 00:50:48,629
Let's do it together.

918
00:50:48,763 --> 00:50:49,063
Ji Hyo.

919
00:50:49,364 --> 00:50:50,631
Now... earlier...

920
00:50:50,698 --> 00:50:53,368
-Ah. I'm going to cry! I'm going to cry! -That was a glorious moment, a really glorious moment.

921
00:50:54,435 --> 00:50:56,137
We have to do this, the shuffle.

922
00:50:59,173 --> 00:51:00,008
Faster, faster!

923
00:51:01,442 --> 00:51:03,444
Oppa, do it faster, faster.

924
00:51:03,878 --> 00:51:05,046
-Ah, I know, I know that. -Faster.

925
00:51:15,490 --> 00:51:16,024
Good!

926
00:51:16,591 --> 00:51:17,492
Great, Jong Kook!

927
00:51:17,592 --> 00:51:18,493
What's this?

928
00:51:18,693 --> 00:51:19,227
Good!

929
00:51:19,727 --> 00:51:20,395

930
00:51:24,065 --> 00:51:26,100
Kim Jong Kook, Kim Jong Kook!

931
00:51:29,504 --> 00:51:30,571
Ah. it's so tiring.

932
00:51:34,342 --> 00:51:36,177
It 's the first time I'm forcing myself to play.

933
00:51:37,145 --> 00:51:38,413
We're forcing ourselves.

934
00:51:41,749 --> 00:51:43,351
Hey, let's form a trio, a trio.

935
00:51:44,318 --> 00:51:46,921
Hyo Min, get up, Hyo Min.

936
00:51:49,023 --> 00:51:50,425
Hey, what are you doing?

937
00:51:52,927 --> 00:51:55,463
To our viewers, are you having a good time?

938
00:51:56,030 --> 00:52:00,301
-We are now with Go A Ra, Im Soo Hyang... -Pump it up.

939
00:52:00,468 --> 00:52:02,804
-Hyo Min and Ji Hyo. -Pump it up.

940
00:52:03,104 --> 00:52:04,138
Do stay with us till the end.

941
00:52:06,441 --> 00:52:07,141
We have to pump it up.

942
00:52:10,178 --> 00:52:11,145
There's the phone.

943
00:52:15,750 --> 00:52:16,184
0h?

944
00:52:16,818 --> 00:52:18,086
-Yes hello, this is Running Man.-Yes.

945
00:52:18,252 --> 00:52:19,253
This is the Easy Brothers in first place.

946
00:52:19,353 --> 00:52:20,955
Yes, congratulations.

947
00:52:21,155 --> 00:52:23,925
- Yes. -The final mission is 'the strongest couple'.

948
00:52:23,991 --> 00:52:24,192
Yes.

949
00:52:24,325 --> 00:52:27,695
Just one person, from the last couple has to survive.

950
00:52:27,795 --> 00:52:29,363
Get rid of all the remaining couple's tags.

951
00:52:29,363 --> 00:52:31,099
Do you have any queries?

952
00:52:31,933 --> 00:52:33,234
No, how do we get rid of them?

953
00:52:34,402 --> 00:52:36,137
-Just tear the tags? -Yes. just tear them all off.

954
00:52:36,971 --> 00:52:37,805
Where do we go?

955
00:52:37,939 --> 00:52:39,640
To the final mission location.

956
00:52:40,942 --> 00:52:42,643
Gwang Soo has something to ask. Hang on.

957
00:52:43,878 --> 00:52:45,213
-Hello? -Your time is up.

958
00:52:46,380 --> 00:52:46,547
Huh?

959
00:52:48,716 --> 00:52:49,283
Hello?

960
00:52:55,022 --> 00:52:58,025
- Oh. - We're the first, we're the first.

961
00:53:00,228 --> 00:53:02,730
Ok, you've already gotten, the entire mission.

962
00:53:02,864 --> 00:53:07,135
-Yes, we've got it. -If you, win in the end. you con take all of these rewards.

963
00:53:10,505 --> 00:53:12,507
-Hyung. no one's even here yet. -Hey, this...

964
00:53:13,207 --> 00:53:14,742
Wow, we have to go in and take a look.

965
00:53:14,842 --> 00:53:16,244
Ah, let's just grab them, really.

966
00:53:16,477 --> 00:53:18,212
Shall we hide here and ambush them?

967
00:53:18,779 --> 00:53:19,347
Oh?

968
00:53:20,181 --> 00:53:20,982
What is it?

969
00:53:21,382 --> 00:53:21,883
Oh?

970
00:53:54,949 --> 00:53:55,883
No. what's this?

971
00:53:55,983 --> 00:53:56,984
What's all this?

972
00:53:58,553 --> 00:53:59,353
Hey. let's...

973
00:54:01,455 --> 00:54:02,123
Feel!

974
00:54:02,323 --> 00:54:02,924
Feel!

975
00:54:03,024 --> 00:54:03,824
Cross!

976
00:54:08,963 --> 00:54:10,398
Hey, close your mouth.

977
00:54:14,235 --> 00:54:14,969
Hello.

978
00:54:20,641 --> 00:54:22,643
Hey, come here.

979
00:54:23,411 --> 00:54:25,546
Hey, don't run off!

980
00:54:31,385 --> 00:54:32,553
Over there, Jong Kook hyung's here.

981
00:54:32,653 --> 00:54:35,623
Jong Kook hyung, Jong Kook hyung on the left, on the left, Jong Kook hyung.

982
00:54:37,625 --> 00:54:38,993
What, are they holding hands?

983
00:54:42,230 --> 00:54:45,099
-Those guys... -The Easy Brothers right?

984
00:55:01,482 --> 00:55:02,516
Good Morning, Angels.

985
00:55:03,050 --> 00:55:07,221
The reason for gathering you here today is to give you a secret mission.

986
00:55:08,189 --> 00:55:11,826
Become Spies and infiltrate the Running Men and get them all out.

987
00:55:11,926 --> 00:55:13,294
We have to get them all out?

988
00:55:13,694 --> 00:55:18,132
One of you just has to survive to win.

989
00:55:18,532 --> 00:55:20,501
Let's pray for luck.

990
00:55:21,502 --> 00:55:24,639
-Charlie, we have to find him. -How do we know who Charlie is?

991
00:55:24,739 --> 00:55:30,177
And Charlie can't be taken out, we have to protect him and get the other Running Men out.

992
00:55:30,711 --> 00:55:32,680
It's like the real Charlie's Angels.

993
00:55:42,923 --> 00:55:43,991
We've arrived?

994
00:55:47,228 --> 00:55:47,928
Soo Hyang.

995
00:55:52,900 --> 00:55:55,369
Can you talk if you're in Jail?

996
00:55:55,770 --> 00:55:56,337
Huh?

997
00:55:56,504 --> 00:55:58,372
Can you talk if you're in Jail?

998
00:55:58,539 --> 00:55:59,607
Yes. Come here, come here.

999
00:56:12,687 --> 00:56:15,423
Two girls are coming this way, stay cool.

1000
00:56:23,264 --> 00:56:24,699
You're here together?

1001
00:56:28,336 --> 00:56:29,704
What's your room number?

1002
00:56:36,744 --> 00:56:37,778
Our tactic's a success.

1003
00:56:38,245 --> 00:56:39,714
I've been working hard... I've been looking for you.

1004
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:41,582
What's the deal, what's the deal?

1005
00:56:41,982 --> 00:56:45,019
- Look, I've always been behind you protecting you - Oppa, are you throwing me aside and escaping by yourself?

1006
00:56:45,052 --> 00:56:47,355
No, I'm not escaping.

1007
00:56:47,688 --> 00:56:48,356
I'm not escaping.

1008
00:56:48,389 --> 00:56:51,225
I'm here ready to help you if you got hurt.

1009
00:56:51,492 --> 00:56:52,393
But why are you here?

1010
00:56:52,426 --> 00:56:53,594
Ah, 1 really saw you.

1011
00:56:53,627 --> 00:56:55,029
I was there, why are you here?

1012
00:56:55,196 --> 00:56:56,931
Hey, I saw you there earlier.

1013
00:56:57,531 --> 00:56:59,233
You really have to believe me, believe me, really.

1014
00:57:07,608 --> 00:57:09,043
But why are there so many of them?

1015
00:57:11,846 --> 00:57:13,748
-What's all this? -Why are these people here?

1016
00:57:13,948 --> 00:57:15,383
Hey, why mus we tear name tags off here?

1017
00:57:19,053 --> 00:57:19,387
Ah, hey.

1018
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:20,654
I got a shock.

1019
00:57:20,688 --> 00:57:21,522
- Hello. - Oh, A Ra.

1020
00:57:21,555 --> 00:57:22,323
Oppa. hello.

1021
00:57:22,423 --> 00:57:23,991
Hey, what are you doing?

1022
00:57:24,325 --> 00:57:25,292
Just the mission.

1023
00:57:25,326 --> 00:57:25,893
What mission?

1024
00:57:25,993 --> 00:57:27,027
Isn't it the to be the best couple?

1025
00:57:27,128 --> 00:57:27,995
Ah. is that so?

1026
00:57:36,604 --> 00:57:38,305
Why is oppa hiding here?

1027
00:57:43,377 --> 00:57:44,245
Ah hey. hey.

1028
00:57:45,913 --> 00:57:46,781
Don't move!

1029
00:57:50,918 --> 00:57:51,352
Yes.

1030
00:57:59,293 --> 00:58:00,094
Unnie.

1031
00:58:00,728 --> 00:58:02,997
Hey. this place is just right. Oh?

1032
00:58:03,798 --> 00:58:05,599
Oh, how can I stay here?

1033
00:58:07,067 --> 00:58:07,935
Ah, it's so cold!

1034
00:58:10,371 --> 00:58:11,672
- Is it very cold? - It's very hot, it's very hot.

1035
00:58:13,941 --> 00:58:16,710
Hey, let's lie in ambush like this for awhile outside.

1036
00:58:16,977 --> 00:58:18,412
Come on in. it's not cold.

1037
00:58:18,913 --> 00:58:20,347
- Come in quickly! - Oppa, is it warm?

1038
00:58:20,548 --> 00:58:21,315
It's warm!

1039
00:58:22,516 --> 00:58:24,185
- Believe me. It's warm! - Believe you?

1040
00:58:24,251 --> 00:58:26,253
-Take one step and you're in. - Really, it's really not cold?

1041
00:58:26,253 --> 00:58:27,555
Right, aren't I in the water?

1042
00:58:27,855 --> 00:58:29,924
Ah, how do I go in, really?

1043
00:58:31,025 --> 00:58:33,093
It's very warm, come in quickly!

1044
00:58:36,397 --> 00:58:37,198
- It's very warm right? - Yes.

1045
00:58:37,298 --> 00:58:38,632
Told you it's very warm.

1046
00:58:39,467 --> 00:58:43,037
Because there's fog here, those over there can't see us.

1047
00:58:45,005 --> 00:58:46,040
Go this way.

1048
00:58:46,907 --> 00:58:49,977
Where does this, where does the water come from?

1049
00:58:50,110 --> 00:58:51,145
Seems like it's a spa.

1050
00:58:51,278 --> 00:58:52,713
The water source.

1051
00:58:53,514 --> 00:58:54,982
It seems like this place is the end.

1052
00:58:55,049 --> 00:58:56,250
It's so cold here.

1053
00:58:56,484 --> 00:58:58,185
Aigoo, stop whining!

1054
00:59:00,855 --> 00:59:02,423
What do I do if my skin shrivels up?

1055
00:59:04,358 --> 00:59:05,659
If you shrivel, you shrivel!

1056
00:59:07,962 --> 00:59:10,898
Does the fog here come from the water?

1057
00:59:11,065 --> 00:59:13,234
I beg you, can't you stop asking questions?

1058
00:59:15,736 --> 00:59:18,405
But I still have so many things I'm curious about.

1059
00:59:22,376 --> 00:59:24,512
It's Jae Suk, be careful of your back.

1060
00:59:25,346 --> 00:59:25,813
Hyung.

1061
00:59:25,980 --> 00:59:26,413
Yes.

1062
00:59:26,547 --> 00:59:29,450
I feel that the game will start when Gwang Soo and hyung's name tags is ripped.

1063
00:59:30,251 --> 00:59:31,752
We re thinking along those lines, hyung.

1064
00:59:31,886 --> 00:59:32,553
Hey.

1065
00:59:32,953 --> 00:59:34,455
We're not easy pickings.

1066
00:59:34,722 --> 00:59:35,523
Jong Kook, where are you going?

1067
00:59:36,123 --> 00:59:37,558
- Be careful. - Hyung.

1068
00:59:41,896 --> 00:59:43,163
Jeez, you're seriously...

1069
00:59:43,497 --> 00:59:45,766
I'm really itching to tear something off.

1070
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:47,568
Aigoo, seriously.

1071
01:00:00,114 --> 01:00:02,583
This is too odd, the mission's too easy.

1072
01:00:05,553 --> 01:00:08,422
We didn't catch that last^part of the hint.

1073
01:00:08,422 --> 01:00:10,758
Could there be, more?

1074
01:00:10,758 --> 01:00:12,192
Maybe we have to find something?

1075
01:00:28,809 --> 01:00:29,710
Hey, come here.

1076
01:00:29,710 --> 01:00:31,078
The Jail has ten chairs, hyung.

1077
01:00:42,022 --> 01:00:43,157
Is it torn off?

1078
01:00:43,157 --> 01:00:44,224
So, you're out?

1079
01:00:45,025 --> 01:00:45,993
What's this?

1080
01:00:49,330 --> 01:00:50,230
What?

1081
01:00:57,338 --> 01:00:59,073
She got me?

1082
01:00:59,073 --> 01:00:59,907
It's not like that.

1083
01:00:59,907 --> 01:01:01,909
I didn't see anyone else's but oppa's.

1084
01:01:01,909 --> 01:01:03,744
No, I don't know.

1085
01:01:03,744 --> 01:01:05,846
Oppa, I'm sorry!

1086
01:01:05,846 --> 01:01:08,015
I really like oppa a lot!

1087
01:01:08,015 --> 01:01:10,417
It's not my real intention.

1088
01:01:10,417 --> 01:01:12,453
Hey. the timing's really the fastest ever. You're out.

1089
01:01:12,453 --> 01:01:13,621
Ah, I can't stick it back?

1090
01:01:13,621 --> 01:01:15,923
- Are you out? Really? - No...

1091
01:01:15,923 --> 01:01:17,124
No. Soo Hyang...

1092
01:01:17,124 --> 01:01:18,959
No, I was also... hey.

1093
01:01:18,959 --> 01:01:20,260
The shortest time.

1094
01:01:20,260 --> 01:01:22,830
- No, Soo Hyang... - The shortest time in Running Man.

1095
01:01:22,830 --> 01:01:25,766
Hey kids, stand back, she's very scary.

1096
01:01:29,803 --> 01:01:30,704
No...

1097
01:01:32,906 --> 01:01:35,009
Ah, I never even thought A Ra would...

1098
01:01:37,778 --> 01:01:39,613
Ah. it's too hot here.

1099
01:01:41,048 --> 01:01:42,716
Because this is a sauna.

1100
01:01:47,454 --> 01:01:48,355
How did you do it?

1101
01:01:48,355 --> 01:01:51,125
-I can tear them all off, right? We didn't lose right? -Of course.

1102
01:01:51,125 --> 01:01:52,893
That's the mission now.

1103
01:01:52,893 --> 01:01:53,994
Right?

1104
01:01:55,429 --> 01:01:57,398
I feel somewhat uneasy.

1105
01:02:07,508 --> 01:02:09,109
Hey, I was so shocked.

1106
01:02:09,109 --> 01:02:10,411
You rushed out like the wind.

1107
01:02:10,411 --> 01:02:11,111
Ah, I saw it so I just did that.

1108
01:02:11,111 --> 01:02:13,781
Oh, when you were tore it off, how could you be that fast?

1109
01:02:13,781 --> 01:02:16,817
-'Rip', while we were all frozen and you went just like that -Jae Suk oppa. I'm sorry.

1110
01:02:16,817 --> 01:02:18,552
This is my heart.

1111
01:02:31,999 --> 01:02:33,367
It's really good here.

1112
01:02:33,367 --> 01:02:35,102
-Right, it's the best right? -Yeah.

1113
01:02:35,102 --> 01:02:37,037
They can't see anything from outside.

1114
01:02:38,439 --> 01:02:43,177
If we meet Gwang Soo and Suk Jin hyung. we have to get rid of them, got it?

1115
01:02:43,177 --> 01:02:45,813
Then, who will do it?

1116
01:02:45,813 --> 01:02:48,782
I catch them, you tear it off.

1117
01:02:48,782 --> 01:02:51,518
Ah. tear it off when you catch them.

1118
01:02:51,518 --> 01:02:53,454
How do you catch them?

1119
01:02:53,454 --> 01:02:55,422
Just catch hold of them.

1120
01:02:55,422 --> 01:02:57,825
Oppa, then whose will you tear off?

1121
01:02:57,825 --> 01:03:00,394
Why are you curious about so many things?

1122
01:03:00,394 --> 01:03:03,063
-They'll be hapless once we get them out anyway! -It's my first time.

1123
01:03:03,063 --> 01:03:04,164
Hyodol!

1124
01:03:05,299 --> 01:03:07,301
Oppa, no one knows we're hiding here right?

1125
01:03:07,301 --> 01:03:08,702
No one even knows.

1126
01:03:27,321 --> 01:03:29,823
There's nothing special, right?

1127
01:03:29,823 --> 01:03:31,458
There's nothing else right?

1128
01:03:31,458 --> 01:03:32,793
But. we still don't know.

1129
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:35,863
-Hyung, if there are guests... -But, I'm very curious.

1130
01:03:35,863 --> 01:03:37,464
Who tore off Jae Suk oppa's?

1131
01:03:37,464 --> 01:03:38,766
-I tore it off. -A Ra.

1132
01:03:38,766 --> 01:03:40,167
No, we were all together

1133
01:03:40,167 --> 01:03:42,369
We were all In the same place, together.

1134
01:03:42,369 --> 01:03:43,837
We remained as two teams.

1135
01:03:43,837 --> 01:03:47,441
But I happened to see Jae Suk oppa's back so I just tried tore it off and ran.

1136
01:03:47,775 --> 01:03:50,210
But, if you tried to tear it of, of course it will be torn.

1137
01:03:50,210 --> 01:03:52,112
But it was torn easily.

1138
01:03:52,246 --> 01:03:53,447
"Rip", just like that.

1139
01:03:53,447 --> 01:03:54,548
I didn't know I'd tear his off.

1140
01:03:54,548 --> 01:03:56,850
I thought it wouldn't tear easily. I didn't intend to do it.

1141
01:03:57,551 --> 01:04:00,821
-I really didn't. I was simply curious. -Charlie's Angel.

1142
01:04:00,821 --> 01:04:02,356
Charlie's Angels.

1143
01:04:14,902 --> 01:04:16,837
-Jeez, I'm not that. -How about me?

1144
01:04:16,970 --> 01:04:19,072
You're not an Angel, you're a pretty boy.

1145
01:04:20,941 --> 01:04:22,242
She's an Angel, a real beauty.

1146
01:04:22,242 --> 01:04:24,578
Jl Hyo Unnie's a total blossoming flower.

1147
01:04:24,578 --> 01:04:27,080
-She's too pretty. -The most handsome among members.

1148
01:04:32,820 --> 01:04:34,555
Hyung, this.,.

1149
01:04:37,357 --> 01:04:38,125
A Ra?

1150
01:04:39,326 --> 01:04:41,628
Wouldn't I told him?

1151
01:04:41,862 --> 01:04:43,831
Charlie's Angels.

1152
01:04:43,831 --> 01:04:48,402
No. I just tore off a name tag, why am I being suspected.

1153
01:04:48,402 --> 01:04:50,571
I just wanted to tear it off!

1154
01:04:50,571 --> 01:04:53,907
Absolutely cute!

1155
01:04:55,943 --> 01:04:57,477
You try it.

1156
01:05:00,614 --> 01:05:01,949
Loyalty!

1157
01:05:01,949 --> 01:05:04,451
Oppa, what do I do about this?

1158
01:05:04,451 --> 01:05:05,552
My partner...

1159
01:05:05,552 --> 01:05:07,054
See, look at this.

1160
01:05:07,054 --> 01:05:08,021
Huh, look at this.

1161
01:05:08,021 --> 01:05:10,257
I'm really going crazy.

1162
01:05:13,260 --> 01:05:15,362
I feel safe because you're around, Ji Hyo.

1163
01:05:16,630 --> 01:05:18,031
Thank you, Ji Hyo.

1164
01:05:27,174 --> 01:05:30,143
Oh, oh, oppa... oh. oh.

1165
01:05:30,143 --> 01:05:31,211
Over there.

1166
01:05:31,712 --> 01:05:34,147
Jong Kook oppa, Jong Kook oppa.

1167
01:05:34,147 --> 01:05:34,882
He's scary.

1168
01:05:34,882 --> 01:05:36,283
Omo. omo.

1169
01:05:38,118 --> 01:05:39,920
Oh, don't film me.

1170
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:41,622
Don't film me.

1171
01:05:43,824 --> 01:05:47,127
Let me off this once, let me off... hello.

1172
01:05:47,127 --> 01:05:47,995
Hello.

1173
01:05:47,995 --> 01:05:51,131
-Totally... save me. -Let you off?

1174
01:05:51,131 --> 01:05:53,233
-Where's Gary? Gary. -Huh?

1175
01:05:53,233 --> 01:05:54,501
-He's escaped. -Gary oppa.

1176
01:05:54,501 --> 01:05:55,702
Gary should have brought you along?

1177
01:05:55,702 --> 01:05:57,004
Oppa escaped first.

1178
01:05:57,004 --> 01:05:58,338
Really, he left you here?

1179
01:05:58,338 --> 01:06:00,073
He left you behind and escaped?

1180
01:06:04,912 --> 01:06:08,348
Gary oppa, he should be hiding here somewhere.

1181
01:06:09,883 --> 01:06:11,218
Oh oh!

1182
01:06:12,185 --> 01:06:14,454
-Wow, daebak! -How did you know I was here?

1183
01:06:14,454 --> 01:06:15,756
Hyung, hang on.

1184
01:06:15,756 --> 01:06:17,024
Hang on, hyung.

1185
01:06:17,024 --> 01:06:18,458
-Catch hold of his hands. -No, hang on.

1186
01:06:18,458 --> 01:06:20,427
-So you were here. -It's too early, hyung.

1187
01:06:20,427 --> 01:06:21,828
Ah, this is too early, hyung.

1188
01:06:21,828 --> 01:06:23,697
You outlasted Jae Suk oppa.

1189
01:06:23,730 --> 01:06:24,298
Why?

1190
01:06:24,331 --> 01:06:24,998
He's already out.

1191
01:06:24,998 --> 01:06:25,999
Really?

1192
01:06:27,501 --> 01:06:29,569
-It's not a good place here. -Gary oppa's here.

1193
01:06:29,569 --> 01:06:31,271
Tear it off. oppa.

1194
01:06:31,271 --> 01:06:32,639
Tear it off.

1195
01:06:32,639 --> 01:06:34,007
No!

1196
01:06:34,007 --> 01:06:35,208
What's this?

1197
01:06:35,208 --> 01:06:36,843
Hey, what are you doing?

1198
01:06:49,423 --> 01:06:50,424
Hang on.

1199
01:06:50,424 --> 01:06:52,793
Hey A Ra.

1200
01:06:58,131 --> 01:07:00,467
Hey, A Ra tore his off.

1201
01:07:01,234 --> 01:07:05,072
Go A Ra. Go A Ra!

1202
01:07:05,072 --> 01:07:06,306
This is what you do in this game, right?

1203
01:07:06,306 --> 01:07:07,841
Ah. that's right.

1204
01:07:07,841 --> 01:07:09,209
Oppa.

1205
01:07:10,210 --> 01:07:11,979
Hey. how can you leave a girl behind and escape?

1206
01:07:11,979 --> 01:07:14,581
Ah, what escape? I wanted us to hide together.

1207
01:07:15,415 --> 01:07:21,655
Go A Ra, Go A Ra!

1208
01:07:21,655 --> 01:07:23,223
-It's a game where you tear it off. -Go A Ra!

1209
01:07:23,223 --> 01:07:25,125
Everyone's suspecting me because of this.

1210
01:07:26,626 --> 01:07:28,161
Oppa!

1211
01:07:28,161 --> 01:07:29,963
-Oh? -Hey, Gary.

1212
01:07:30,397 --> 01:07:31,431
-What did he say? -Ah.

1213
01:07:31,431 --> 01:07:33,033
I don't know, I don't know.

1214
01:07:33,033 --> 01:07:34,134
I'm not doing it.

1215
01:07:34,134 --> 01:07:35,469
Hey Hyo Min, didn't you not do anything?

1216
01:07:35,469 --> 01:07:37,738
How?

1217
01:07:43,977 --> 01:07:46,380
They are suspecting me because I tore it off.

1218
01:07:46,380 --> 01:07:47,447
But it isn't me.

1219
01:07:47,647 --> 01:07:52,386
-I was just working hard. -It's just Miss A Ra at 100%, she was just working hard.

1220
01:07:52,386 --> 01:07:53,854
Ah. don't we tear them off?

1221
01:07:53,854 --> 01:07:55,022
We should tear them off right?

1222
01:07:55,022 --> 01:07:56,656
That's right. That's the game.

1223
01:07:56,656 --> 01:07:57,224
Right?

1224
01:07:57,224 --> 01:07:59,126
We were too weak because of our affections.

1225
01:07:59,126 --> 01:08:02,229
You helped us and I'm very grateful actually.

1226
01:08:02,229 --> 01:08:03,630
Because you tore it off so quickly.

1227
01:08:03,630 --> 01:08:04,598
I'm so sorry.

1228
01:08:04,598 --> 01:08:05,932
No. Ah really, don't be.

1229
01:08:05,932 --> 01:08:07,167
You did well, you did well.

1230
01:08:07,901 --> 01:08:08,635
A Ra.

1231
01:08:08,635 --> 01:08:09,403
Yes?

1232
01:08:09,403 --> 01:08:12,139
It's better that the females tear the females' tags off.

1233
01:08:12,139 --> 01:08:14,007
-The females do it first? -It's better if the females...

1234
01:08:14,007 --> 01:08:16,376
But I also feel affection towards them...

1235
01:08:16,376 --> 01:08:17,944
Because we're females,

1236
01:08:17,944 --> 01:08:19,880
-It's usually females tearing off the female tags. -I feel sorry about it.

1237
01:08:19,880 --> 01:08:20,881
We were all like this.

1238
01:08:20,881 --> 01:08:21,882
-Is that so? -Yes.

1239
01:08:21,882 --> 01:08:23,383
-Because it's not ideal for men to tear off the females' tags.

1240
01:08:23,383 --> 01:08:26,053
Yes, I don't think I can do it to Ji Hyo Unnie. -No, for Ji Hyo...
-Earlier I was about to tore Hyo Min's but because she's a girl...

1241
01:08:26,053 --> 01:08:27,087
-So oppa, tear them.
Yes, I don't think I can do it to Ji Hyo Unnie. -No, for Ji Hyo...
-Earlier I was about to tore Hyo Min's but because she's a girl...

1242
01:08:27,087 --> 01:08:27,554
Yes, I don't think I can do it to Ji Hyo Unnie. -No, for Ji Hyo...
-So oppa, tear them.

1243
01:08:27,554 --> 01:08:29,656
-Oppa should do it. -Don't view Ji Hyo as a real woman.
Yes, I don't think I can do it to Ji Hyo Unnie. -No, for Ji Hyo...

1244
01:08:29,656 --> 01:08:30,157
-Really. -No.
Yes, I don't think I can do it to Ji Hyo Unnie. -No, for Ji Hyo...

1245
01:08:30,157 --> 01:08:30,757
-Really. -No.

1246
01:08:30,757 --> 01:08:31,491
Absolutely not.

1247
01:08:31,491 --> 01:08:33,260
-It can't be me! -Hey.

1248
01:08:33,393 --> 01:08:34,995
Let's go out.

1249
01:08:41,768 --> 01:08:44,037
Hey I'm. I'm going into the water!

1250
01:08:44,037 --> 01:08:44,504
Oppa. I can't go into the water.
Hey I'm. I'm going into the water!

1251
01:08:44,504 --> 01:08:45,372
Oppa. I can't go into the water.

1252
01:08:45,539 --> 01:08:46,339
Hey, what's this here?

1253
01:08:46,339 --> 01:08:47,641
Let's go in there.

1254
01:08:47,641 --> 01:08:49,276
If they enter it will be so hot that they'll die.

1255
01:08:49,276 --> 01:08:51,178
Lock the door.

1256
01:08:52,446 --> 01:08:54,214
Hide me.

1257
01:08:54,514 --> 01:08:55,782
Go tear them off quickly.

1258
01:08:56,016 --> 01:08:57,684
What?

1259
01:08:57,684 --> 01:08:59,386
You go then!

1260
01:08:59,386 --> 01:09:01,288
You're better at fighting than I am.

1261
01:09:01,288 --> 01:09:03,156
You're good at it too.

1262
01:09:03,890 --> 01:09:07,627
You fool, God has given you strength so use it quick.

1263
01:09:07,627 --> 01:09:08,895
What about you? What about you?

1264
01:09:08,895 --> 01:09:10,297
I have my shortness.

1265
01:09:10,297 --> 01:09:11,865
I was born short.

1266
01:09:13,100 --> 01:09:15,168
That's how I live.

1267
01:09:15,569 --> 01:09:16,837
Be quiet.

1268
01:09:17,237 --> 01:09:18,605
What do I do without strength?

1269
01:09:18,605 --> 01:09:19,673
Why are you like this?

1270
01:09:19,673 --> 01:09:21,007
I don't even have any strength!

1271
01:09:21,007 --> 01:09:22,642
We're partners!

1272
01:09:23,210 --> 01:09:25,445
Because it seems like you'll abandon me.

1273
01:09:26,580 --> 01:09:27,981
You idiot.

1274
01:09:37,224 --> 01:09:39,793
Jong Kook oppa, might be Charlie.

1275
01:09:39,793 --> 01:09:41,394
Omo, Jong Kook oppa?

1276
01:09:43,196 --> 01:09:45,332
Jong Kook oppa.

1277
01:09:45,332 --> 01:09:47,467
-Or Ji Hyo Unnie. -Ji Hyo Unnie.

1278
01:09:48,068 --> 01:09:52,939
It's Ji Hyo Unnie, more so because she's a female.

1279
01:09:52,939 --> 01:09:55,175
-She may be Charlie. -Maybe, she's Charlie.

1280
01:09:55,175 --> 01:10:00,981
-And Charlie may not necessarily be a man. -But JI Hyo Unnie hasn't even helped us once.

1281
01:10:03,016 --> 01:10:05,886
Shall we let A Ra try testing him out? Jong Kook oppa.

1282
01:10:06,019 --> 01:10:10,157
Like this, shall we ask "Oppa, do you have a puppy"?

1283
01:10:10,857 --> 01:10:13,393
-After asking this... -After asking this, we'll say our puppy's name is Charlie!

1284
01:10:16,997 --> 01:10:21,101
Oh! My puppy is cute, my puppy's name is also Charlie!

1285
01:10:21,101 --> 01:10:23,837
After that we'll look at his expression together.

1286
01:10:24,204 --> 01:10:26,406
We must quickly convey this to A Ra.

1287
01:10:31,111 --> 01:10:31,678
Oh!

1288
01:10:47,494 --> 01:10:50,697
Rather than tearing guys' name tags, it's better if you could tear the girls'.

1289
01:10:50,697 --> 01:10:52,599
-Tear off the girls' name tags? -It's not good for me to tear off the girls' name tags.

1290
01:10:52,599 --> 01:10:58,638
-But I also have feelings for the girls, as we are all girls. -Girls should tear the other girls' name tags.

1291
01:10:58,638 --> 01:10:59,272
Is that so?

1292
01:11:26,933 --> 01:11:29,736
Why! Why! Why! Why! Why! A Ra. why are you like this!

1293
01:11:31,538 --> 01:11:32,405
Oppa!

1294
01:11:34,207 --> 01:11:37,377
Where are you going? Quickly, catch him!

1295
01:11:44,784 --> 01:11:46,353
I almost got him!

1296
01:11:47,621 --> 01:11:51,324
-Stay here first. He thinks only A Ra is suspicious. -No, it's all of us.

1297
01:11:51,324 --> 01:11:55,762
-All of us? -We cannot let him tell the rest!

1298
01:11:55,762 --> 01:11:58,231
-Quickly, catch him! -What do we do?

1299
01:11:58,431 --> 01:12:02,302
-Ah!! Really!! What do we do? -You should have given us a wink just now!

1300
01:12:02,469 --> 01:12:04,904
I was giving you both side glances the whole time!

1301
01:12:06,306 --> 01:12:08,808
Oh, that was scary. Oh, that was scary!

1302
01:12:09,442 --> 01:12:10,310
Hey what is this?

1303
01:12:17,884 --> 01:12:22,055
Hey, I will die.

1304
01:12:22,055 --> 01:12:23,923
So you both should act like you are not spies!

1305
01:12:23,923 --> 01:12:28,962
-Wait... Even if we act like we're not, this won't do. -Also both of you. don't make it seem so obvious.

1306
01:12:28,962 --> 01:12:35,201
-If that doesn't work. I'll sacrifice myself. -No. Tear off one more person's before you die!

1307
01:12:38,672 --> 01:12:42,108
-I already have no chance of survival. -Seems like Jong Kook oppa is Charlie.

1308
01:12:43,043 --> 01:12:44,477
Charlie? No way.

1309
01:12:44,477 --> 01:12:47,714
Just try confirming it once again.

1310
01:12:47,714 --> 01:12:50,183
Just say "Oppa, Charlie Charlie!" to him.

1311
01:12:50,183 --> 01:12:51,418
Ok, I understand.

1312
01:12:51,918 --> 01:12:53,553
I feel that Jong Kook oppa is Charlie.

1313
01:12:54,154 --> 01:12:56,022
Go for it! No matter what we must win!

1314
01:13:03,396 --> 01:13:04,064
Where is it?

1315
01:13:07,300 --> 01:13:08,101
Let's go out to take a look.

1316
01:13:08,735 --> 01:13:10,704
Seems like something happened to Jong Kook hyung.

1317
01:13:13,206 --> 01:13:15,008
As long as we have this, we will survive.

1318
01:13:18,044 --> 01:13:19,179
Get some more.

1319
01:13:19,412 --> 01:13:21,314
-More? -Take more...

1320
01:13:36,496 --> 01:13:37,263
Jong Kook hyung!

1321
01:13:41,034 --> 01:13:41,835
Hey, What?

1322
01:13:42,535 --> 01:13:43,303
Hey, What?

1323
01:13:44,003 --> 01:13:44,738
Hey!

1324
01:13:56,015 --> 01:13:57,083
Good morning angels.

1325
01:13:57,584 --> 01:14:01,888
Today your mission is to eliminate all of the Running Man members except Charlie.

1326
01:14:03,590 --> 01:14:06,593
Charlie is one of the Running Man members.

1327
01:14:08,161 --> 01:14:12,298
-So one of them knows of our existence. -We have to find Charlie?

1328
01:14:49,068 --> 01:14:52,138
Nobody would guess that I am Charlie even in their dreams, right?

1329
01:14:53,540 --> 01:14:56,376
Although everyone will be very happy when they hear there will be beautiful guests.

1330
01:14:56,376 --> 01:14:58,211
Wait till they suffer this time.

1331
01:15:04,184 --> 01:15:04,818
Hey, What?

1332
01:15:05,485 --> 01:15:06,319
Hey, What?

1333
01:15:07,053 --> 01:15:07,620
Hey!

1334
01:15:09,823 --> 01:15:11,558
Turn Off the lights! Quick, turn off the lights!

1335
01:15:13,026 --> 01:15:13,860
Hey, Dong Hoon!

1336
01:15:14,561 --> 01:15:16,496
Dong Hoon! Dong Hoon!

1337
01:15:17,931 --> 01:15:21,167
Dong Hoon! Were you tricked?

1338
01:15:21,568 --> 01:15:22,135
Dong Hoon!

1339
01:15:23,803 --> 01:15:24,437
Dong Hoon!

1340
01:15:27,507 --> 01:15:29,576
The 4 girls are culprits.

1341
01:15:35,315 --> 01:15:36,382
You didn't know, right?

1342
01:15:40,687 --> 01:15:41,855
The 3 girls are the culprits.

1343
01:15:42,655 --> 01:15:44,290
The 3 girls are culprits! Dong Hoon!

1344
01:15:45,625 --> 01:15:47,760
Something big happened! What should I do?

1345
01:15:50,697 --> 01:15:51,397
What?

1346
01:15:52,198 --> 01:15:55,368
You only survived this far because you used me as a shield.

1347
01:15:58,438 --> 01:16:00,073
Didn't you promise to protect me?

1348
01:16:01,474 --> 01:16:03,409
You should have been nice to me.

1349
01:16:03,776 --> 01:16:08,314
-I knew something was fishy about you! -Be quiet!

1350
01:16:08,481 --> 01:16:11,518
How can you use me as a shield for the whole day?

1351
01:16:12,819 --> 01:16:14,420
Do you know how much I trusted you?

1352
01:16:14,721 --> 01:16:16,689
-You trusted me? Trusted me? -That's right.

1353
01:16:16,689 --> 01:16:19,659
Because you trust me so you left me alone in the jungle and ran off?

1354
01:16:20,093 --> 01:16:21,694
Is it a jungle? It's a swimming pool?!

1355
01:16:24,330 --> 01:16:25,798
Let go!! can walk out with my own legs.

1356
01:16:26,032 --> 01:16:26,766
You!

1357
01:16:27,066 --> 01:16:28,167
You just go.

1358
01:16:29,235 --> 01:16:30,436
Me? You?

1359
01:16:30,770 --> 01:16:31,738
Just go!

1360
01:16:32,138 --> 01:16:33,406
He's really noisy!

1361
01:16:39,913 --> 01:16:40,914
Oh, who's that over there?

1362
01:16:43,383 --> 01:16:44,984
Who is that? The one at the back.

1363
01:16:47,186 --> 01:16:49,689
It's Haha oppa! Haha oppa is dead!

1364
01:16:49,923 --> 01:16:51,691
Haha oppa died... Ji Hyo unnie did this!

1365
01:16:52,525 --> 01:16:55,495
-Ji Hyo unnie is outside. -It's Ji Hyo unnie.

1366
01:16:55,995 --> 01:16:59,732
-It 's Ji Hyo unnie who helped us. -We have to go and meet her once.

1367
01:17:02,969 --> 01:17:06,205
This is what makes a good game! Now is the climax, now!

1368
01:17:06,372 --> 01:17:08,241
There is no need to hide anymore!

1369
01:17:21,554 --> 01:17:22,388
What are you two doing?

1370
01:17:25,024 --> 01:17:26,626
-Oppa! Oppa! -Why?

1371
01:17:26,626 --> 01:17:28,461
It's not! Oppa, don't run away!

1372
01:17:28,461 --> 01:17:31,931
-Oppa, don't run away! Oppa, wait awhile! -Why wait?

1373
01:17:32,398 --> 01:17:35,501
-Have you seen A Ra? -You both are together, you both.

1374
01:17:35,702 --> 01:17:37,203
-What? -There's only the two of you?

1375
01:17:37,203 --> 01:17:38,838
-Yes. -Have you seen A Ra?

1376
01:17:39,472 --> 01:17:40,940
You should know (A Ra) where A Ra is.

1377
01:17:42,275 --> 01:17:44,711
Oh? What's that. Hey! A Ra!

1378
01:17:46,245 --> 01:17:47,914
-oppa! -Why are you like that?

1379
01:17:47,914 --> 01:17:48,881
I am really sorry.

1380
01:17:50,783 --> 01:17:54,454
-We have to tear off Jong Kook oppa's now! -Now Jong Kook oppa...

1381
01:17:56,623 --> 01:18:01,361
-Hey, you really... -Oppa, I am really sorry, although you are my partner...

1382
01:18:01,628 --> 01:18:06,132
Our puppy's name is Charlie.

1383
01:18:06,566 --> 01:18:08,368
Our cat's name is Charlie.

1384
01:18:14,540 --> 01:18:16,576
You all didn't know between yourselves?

1385
01:18:17,410 --> 01:18:19,045
So you all didn't know between yourselves!

1386
01:18:20,113 --> 01:18:21,414
Wa, really!

1387
01:18:22,081 --> 01:18:24,183
-Oppa, tear it off! Tear it off! -What is this?

1388
01:18:24,484 --> 01:18:25,518
What is this?

1389
01:18:26,919 --> 01:18:28,488
You all really didn't know?

1390
01:18:33,326 --> 01:18:36,029
What you said just now was great!

1391
01:18:43,870 --> 01:18:47,140
-We have to find out who is Charlie, -Us, us.

1392
01:18:47,140 --> 01:18:49,175
-Yes, only the 3 of us. -Charlie's Angels?

1393
01:18:50,443 --> 01:18:54,080
-He mentioned it earlier. -And then there's our Charlie.

1394
01:18:55,281 --> 01:18:57,483
That's the situation for now.

1395
01:19:03,823 --> 01:19:06,659
-What? Jong Kook hyung is also tricked? -What are you?

1396
01:19:07,326 --> 01:19:09,028
Why didn't you come out when I called you earlier?

1397
01:19:09,228 --> 01:19:11,397
-Hyung, you're too scary. -What's so scary about me?

1398
01:19:12,198 --> 01:19:15,034
-Didn't you hear my desperate call earlier? -Hyung, you are very scary now.

1399
01:19:15,768 --> 01:19:19,505
Hey! I called you like this "Dong Hoon. where are .you?" Do I call you like this when I want to catch you?

1400
01:19:19,505 --> 01:19:24,677
-Then when I was shouting "Jong Kook hyung" I got caught from the back. -Hey, A Ra definitely has something up her sleeve.

1401
01:19:24,677 --> 01:19:27,213
It's not just A Ra. What you said before was right.

1402
01:19:27,213 --> 01:19:28,214
-All? All? -The girls?

1403
01:19:28,214 --> 01:19:30,016
How many beauties are there amongst the girls today?

1404
01:19:30,183 --> 01:19:31,884
- What is 'Mineo'? - Beautiful girls.

1405
01:19:32,085 --> 01:19:34,587
- Charlie's Angels! - There are 3 beauties, right?

1406
01:19:34,787 --> 01:19:38,591
- No. Ji Hyo tore Haha's name tag. - Ji Hyo is Charlie.

1407
01:19:38,725 --> 01:19:39,892
Yes. the guy. the guy.

1408
01:19:39,992 --> 01:19:42,995
-In Charlie's Angels, there's a guy called Charlie. - There's Charlie.

1409
01:19:43,229 --> 01:19:45,431
Ji Hyo is helping them.

1410
01:19:45,565 --> 01:19:47,166
See, what 1 said was correct.

1411
01:19:49,302 --> 01:19:50,236
Where is Jong Kook hyung?

1412
01:19:54,006 --> 01:19:54,774
Jong Kook hyung!

1413
01:19:57,076 --> 01:19:57,977
Jong Kook hyung!

1414
01:20:00,179 --> 01:20:01,614
A Ra, A Ra, A Ra!

1415
01:20:02,081 --> 01:20:05,384
- A Ra, you... - Oppa, it's not what you think. Where are you going, oppa?

1416
01:20:06,219 --> 01:20:07,653
No, no, no. Gwang Soo!

1417
01:20:09,155 --> 01:20:09,789
Ah! Really scary!

1418
01:20:12,759 --> 01:20:14,193
What happened? What happened?

1419
01:20:16,195 --> 01:20:17,063
Why are all of you here?

1420
01:20:19,132 --> 01:20:21,968
Come here, come here!

1421
01:20:23,870 --> 01:20:24,704
Hey Gwang Soo!

1422
01:20:24,704 --> 01:20:26,472
- What happened to Jong Kook hyung? - Don't!

1423
01:20:26,806 --> 01:20:27,673
Don't!

1424
01:20:28,007 --> 01:20:29,609
Hey! Don't do anything dangerous!

1425
01:20:29,776 --> 01:20:32,044
Don't do anything dangerous! Don't do anything. dangerous!

1426
01:20:34,113 --> 01:20:34,914
Wait!

1427
01:20:36,015 --> 01:20:38,217
- Catch him. catch him! - Hey, hey, hey!

1428
01:20:41,053 --> 01:20:43,256
- Don't hurt yourself! - Hey!

1429
01:20:43,256 --> 01:20:47,059
- Think of your family! - No, wait, no!

1430
01:20:47,059 --> 01:20:48,661
It's not like that, kids...

1431
01:20:48,828 --> 01:20:50,329
- Kids! Kids! - Tear it!

1432
01:20:52,799 --> 01:20:56,102
You all... You all! Gwang Soo! Hey! Wait!

1433
01:20:57,904 --> 01:20:59,539
Wait, wait!

1434
01:21:00,940 --> 01:21:04,143
Hey! Hey!

1435
01:21:07,914 --> 01:21:11,684
It's all torn off from the back.

1436
01:21:11,684 --> 01:21:13,820
- Sorry oppa. -What is this?

1437
01:21:29,836 --> 01:21:32,171
- Don't attack me! - I'm not!

1438
01:21:32,538 --> 01:21:33,806
- Really? -I said I'm not.

1439
01:21:34,340 --> 01:21:36,509
- Where is Suk Jin hyung? - Where are you going?

1440
01:21:43,516 --> 01:21:45,484
Hey, where did you go?

1441
01:21:46,085 --> 01:21:49,355
-Are you a spy, or not? Tell me quickly! - I am not a spy.

1442
01:21:49,355 --> 01:21:51,457
- Then why did you run? - They...

1443
01:21:53,693 --> 01:21:55,328
- What happened? - What happened?

1444
01:21:55,661 --> 01:21:56,696
You will die.

1445
01:21:56,696 --> 01:21:58,264
-Why will I die? - You will die.

1446
01:21:58,264 --> 01:22:00,166
- Why? - Your life is doomed.

1447
01:22:16,749 --> 01:22:18,350
- What happened? - What happened?

1448
01:22:18,351 --> 01:22:19,385
You will die.

1449
01:22:19,385 --> 01:22:20,953
-Why will I die? - You will die.

1450
01:22:20,953 --> 01:22:22,855
- Why? - Your life is doomed.

1451
01:22:38,204 --> 01:22:39,605
We tore it, we tore it!

1452
01:22:41,040 --> 01:22:41,874
You are a spy?

1453
01:22:45,344 --> 01:22:46,679
Oh? What is this.

1454
01:22:47,513 --> 01:22:49,548
Soo Hyang, what happened, Hyo Min?

1455
01:22:49,649 --> 01:22:51,784
What happened? Who is Charlie?

1456
01:22:53,452 --> 01:22:54,620
Ah, Ji Hyo!

1457
01:22:54,620 --> 01:22:58,424
- We were totally right. Charlie's Angels. - We were totally fooled.

1458
01:22:59,725 --> 01:23:01,427
- What is Soo Hyang? - 010...

1459
01:23:02,061 --> 01:23:04,664
- And there's 4 and 5... - What's that? Someone's phone number?

1460
01:23:05,264 --> 01:23:06,465
- Is that your number? - No.

1461
01:23:08,034 --> 01:23:13,506
If you called the number, I'd have told you that today's Charlie was Song Ji Hyo.

1462
01:23:13,906 --> 01:23:16,142
You just need to eliminate Song Ji Hyo.

1463
01:23:16,142 --> 01:23:18,844
And the remaining Running Man members would win.

1464
01:23:18,844 --> 01:23:21,314
I keep wanting to tear off Ji Hyo's.

1465
01:23:21,314 --> 01:23:22,181
What a pity.

1466
01:23:23,182 --> 01:23:25,284
Take this and share it with your family.

1467
01:23:26,218 --> 01:23:28,321
- What is this? -1, 2, 3.

1468
01:23:28,321 --> 01:23:28,888
Tada!

1469
01:23:29,455 --> 01:23:30,356
Wow!

1470
01:23:30,489 --> 01:23:32,058
- It's gold! - It's real!

1471
01:23:32,291 --> 01:23:33,993
It's really a gold ring!

1472
01:23:34,994 --> 01:23:38,064
How much gold have you got already?

1473
01:23:38,164 --> 01:23:40,733
Wow. Daebak!

1474
01:23:40,733 --> 01:23:45,738
Congratulations to our Charlie's Angels and Song Ji Hyo!

1475
01:24:05,191 --> 01:24:06,592
Running Man!
