1
00:00:10,093 --> 00:00:12,362
-I will identify today's Spy. -Enemies are everywhere.

2
00:00:12,362 --> 00:00:13,863
I'm not the Spy.

3
00:00:13,863 --> 00:00:15,798
What should I do?

4
00:00:15,798 --> 00:00:18,668
Either way I'm alone, I'm dead anyway.

5
00:00:18,734 --> 00:00:19,402
Hey, hey.

6
00:00:19,402 --> 00:00:20,002
Hey!

7
00:00:20,002 --> 00:00:22,171
-It's the best in history! -Wait. I'll tear it off later!

8
00:00:22,171 --> 00:00:23,372
Hey. hey.

9
00:00:23,372 --> 00:00:25,474
I'm seriously going crazy.

10
00:00:25,474 --> 00:00:27,743
Who's next? Don't let me see you.

11
00:00:30,612 --> 00:00:32,247
Where has Kim Jong Kook gone to?

12
00:00:32,247 --> 00:00:34,149
Why is he so late?

13
00:00:34,149 --> 00:00:36,951
Kim Jong Kook wouldn't be given some mission right?

14
00:00:36,951 --> 00:00:39,720
-He wouldn't be with Yoon Eun Hye? -He could be with Yoon Eun Hye.

15
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:41,389
He could be with Yoon Eun Hye.

16
00:00:41,389 --> 00:00:43,224
-Oh, is Yoon Eun Hye coming? -Really?

17
00:00:43,224 --> 00:00:44,792
Hey really, Yoon Hye... hey.

18
00:00:44,792 --> 00:00:47,661
If we start from the X-Man days that's twelve years of love,

19
00:00:47,661 --> 00:00:49,596
-I hope they have a happy ending. -Right, we hope they have a happy ending.

20
00:00:49,596 --> 00:00:51,465
I hope that couple has a happy ending.

21
00:00:51,465 --> 00:00:53,933
Let's do "Dangyunhaji" later.

22
00:00:53,933 --> 00:00:55,635
-Hey, then... -Please, let that couple...

23
00:00:55,635 --> 00:00:59,872
Also, it's time we need a new love line.

24
00:00:59,972 --> 00:01:01,540
It's still not over!

25
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:03,542
-Ah. Monday isn't over yet. -Look at this person.

26
00:01:03,542 --> 00:01:07,780
-I'm the only one left. There's no one else. -You're most suited to be a playboy.

27
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:11,116
Then... I got it. Make a love line for Haha too.

28
00:01:11,116 --> 00:01:11,917
-Yes. -With hyung.

29
00:01:11,917 --> 00:01:14,019
-I want it to be with a female. -Hey. I love you.

30
00:01:14,019 --> 00:01:17,755
Because I missed you I didn't sleep a wink last night,

31
00:01:25,963 --> 00:01:29,766
-The love line has started. -I spent last night erasing your text messages.

32
00:01:29,766 --> 00:01:32,436
-Your love line with me has started. -My heart's beating so fast here.

33
00:01:32,436 --> 00:01:34,471
Hey, I'm about to go crazy.

34
00:01:34,471 --> 00:01:35,972
My pillow's all wet.

35
00:01:35,972 --> 00:01:38,207
Ah. I'm seriously about to go crazy!

36
00:01:38,207 --> 00:01:41,711
-Your love line's already ended too. -Hey, it's just starting.

37
00:01:41,711 --> 00:01:43,746
Your love line's ended too.

38
00:01:46,982 --> 00:01:49,084
Get permission before coming!

39
00:01:49,118 --> 00:01:51,086
Can't you feel how jittery I am?

40
00:01:51,086 --> 00:01:52,220
Hey.

41
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,522
They've already broken up!

42
00:01:55,357 --> 00:01:57,859
I've been drinking alone for three days!

43
00:01:58,593 --> 00:02:01,262
Just drinking one cup after another!

44
00:02:01,262 --> 00:02:03,597
I was in Hong Dae looking like this.

45
00:02:03,597 --> 00:02:07,468
-I knew it would turn out like this. -I've was like this in Hongdae.

46
00:02:07,735 --> 00:02:10,304
But, shouldn't we leave quickly?

47
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:12,773
-Ok today, the guests... -Yes.

48
00:02:12,773 --> 00:02:14,608
Have been waiting in the car park.

49
00:02:14,608 --> 00:02:15,742
Oh?

50
00:02:18,678 --> 00:02:21,247
Does everyone see the three cars behind you?

51
00:02:21,247 --> 00:02:21,981
Yes.

52
00:02:21,981 --> 00:02:24,750
The guest are currently inside there.

53
00:02:28,654 --> 00:02:33,992
Ok. starting from now. you'll be a team with the guest who alights from the car!

54
00:02:33,992 --> 00:02:39,364
-You choose whether to stand in front of Car 1. Car 2 or Car 3 yourself. -Ok.

55
00:02:39,397 --> 00:02:40,898
-Ok. set off. -Where, where?

56
00:02:40,898 --> 00:02:42,767
-Which one is Number 1? -Number 1's here.

57
00:02:42,767 --> 00:02:44,101
Number 3, Number 3.

58
00:02:44,635 --> 00:02:46,170
-Oh, -Hey, it's Number 1!

59
00:02:46,704 --> 00:02:48,439
I want Number 1 too.

60
00:02:51,041 --> 00:02:52,643
I want Number 3.

61
00:02:53,076 --> 00:02:54,344
That was weird right, earlier?

62
00:02:54,344 --> 00:02:57,080
-Hey, do you want to be with me? -It doesn't matter to me.

63
00:03:00,683 --> 00:03:01,951
We'll start from. Car 1!

64
00:03:01,984 --> 00:03:04,754
-Shout. "Please come out." -Ok.

65
00:03:04,987 --> 00:03:06,722
Ok, please come out!

66
00:03:07,923 --> 00:03:09,625
Ok, please come out!

67
00:03:23,905 --> 00:03:29,510
What's this?

68
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:30,678
Ah. really.

69
00:03:31,278 --> 00:03:33,447
Why are you applying lip balm?

70
00:03:36,983 --> 00:03:39,786
It doesn't make sense.

71
00:03:39,786 --> 00:03:41,354
Ah seriously, applying lip balm.

72
00:03:41,354 --> 00:03:44,357
Why apply lip balm?

73
00:03:44,357 --> 00:03:46,659
So today, the three of you are in a team.

74
00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:48,094
-Huh? -Seriously.

75
00:03:48,094 --> 00:03:50,663
Your fortune today isn't too bad.

76
00:03:50,696 --> 00:03:55,367
-I so want to grab that person by the collar, -Seriously. I really want to do it.

77
00:03:55,434 --> 00:03:58,536
-Ok, come over here to Car 2. -I'm trembling!

78
00:03:58,536 --> 00:04:00,672
Oppa. I feel it's a pity too.

79
00:04:00,672 --> 00:04:02,707
-A guy! -A guy, please let it be a guy.

80
00:04:03,141 --> 00:04:05,243
Please come out!

81
00:04:22,792 --> 00:04:24,394
Yeah!

82
00:04:26,662 --> 00:04:29,198
-Ah, so it's the three of them? -What are you doing?

83
00:04:32,968 --> 00:04:35,637
So. today the two of you are a team.

84
00:04:36,305 --> 00:04:37,906
Hey, Gwang Soo.

85
00:04:37,906 --> 00:04:41,109
You're seriously, going to have a nosebleed when you're at Busan.

86
00:04:42,443 --> 00:04:44,212
-It's beneficial for you. -Oh, such stress!

87
00:04:44,212 --> 00:04:46,681
Oh, I'm beginning to lose weight!

88
00:04:51,652 --> 00:04:54,254
-Wow. I'm feeling very good now. -I'm anticipating it.

89
00:04:54,388 --> 00:04:55,689
One, two. three.

90
00:04:55,689 --> 00:04:58,058
Please come out!

91
00:05:08,768 --> 00:05:11,237
-Pretty, pretty! -Hey,

92
00:05:14,339 --> 00:05:19,311
Lee Da Hae!

93
00:05:28,853 --> 00:05:36,493
Lee Da Hae, Lee Da Hae!

94
00:05:38,195 --> 00:05:40,664
-Hey. -Aigoo!

95
00:05:44,167 --> 00:05:45,201
Aigoo!

96
00:05:45,201 --> 00:05:47,203
Get lost!

97
00:05:48,404 --> 00:05:49,705
Aigoo!

98
00:05:50,706 --> 00:05:52,675
-Get lost! -Aigoo. Da Hae,

99
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:56,245
Hey. Gwang Soo,

100
00:05:57,179 --> 00:05:58,680
Aigoo. aigoo.

101
00:06:05,086 --> 00:06:07,655
Aigoo. I should have picked this car.

102
00:06:08,389 --> 00:06:09,390
-Oppa. -What?

103
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:11,992
-She's not at oppa's. -Ji Hyo!

104
00:06:11,992 --> 00:06:14,662
I should have picked this car.

105
00:06:15,262 --> 00:06:18,498
Wow. Song Ji Hyo's face is super huge. Wow,

106
00:06:18,498 --> 00:06:23,637
Hey, you... you're even shorter than, Lee Da Hae, compared to Da Hae!

107
00:06:23,637 --> 00:06:26,339
Lee Da Hae and the Lollols, Lee Da Hae and the Lollols.

108
00:06:26,339 --> 00:06:28,174
Ah, that's fine too.

109
00:06:30,042 --> 00:06:31,877
I'm very close to Da Hae,

110
00:06:31,944 --> 00:06:33,813
-Stop it! -Exactly.

111
00:06:33,813 --> 00:06:35,948
-Don't be like that. -Her surname!

112
00:06:37,816 --> 00:06:40,118
- Call her by her surname. - I'm very unhappy if you're like this!

113
00:06:40,218 --> 00:06:41,553
Nice to meet you. Da Hae.

114
00:06:41,553 --> 00:06:42,621
-Yes, nice to meet you. -Hello.

115
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:44,522
Noona looks so awkward,

116
00:06:44,522 --> 00:06:45,857
Hey. who's older?

117
00:06:45,857 --> 00:06:47,759
She looks much older.

118
00:06:48,993 --> 00:06:50,661
-Ji Hyo. -Hey. hey.

119
00:06:52,296 --> 00:06:54,398
Today we'll stay with the same groups the entire time.

120
00:06:54,398 --> 00:06:57,267
Don't be overly upset.

121
00:06:57,301 --> 00:06:59,937
There isn't a chance to change teams? I'm just curious.

122
00:06:59,937 --> 00:07:01,338
-Do you watch Running Man often? -I quite like Jong Kook hyung.

123
00:07:01,338 --> 00:07:01,772
Yes.

124
00:07:01,772 --> 00:07:04,007
Who would you personally like to be on a team with?

125
00:07:04,007 --> 00:07:06,309
-Ah. I like this team very much. -Oh my god.

126
00:07:06,309 --> 00:07:08,378
Oh my god. oh my god.

127
00:07:09,946 --> 00:07:11,581
You stop it.

128
00:07:11,581 --> 00:07:13,416
There won't be changing of teams today.

129
00:07:13,416 --> 00:07:18,120
Starting from here now. teams will board the plane holding hands.

130
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,689
Holding hands, those two.

131
00:07:23,425 --> 00:07:25,694
Holding hands like this?

132
00:07:25,694 --> 00:07:28,496
What hands have so many calluses?

133
00:07:33,668 --> 00:07:38,839
- Linking arms or holding hands? - Because you're a little taller I'll just hold it in the reverse way.

134
00:08:02,094 --> 00:08:05,697
Ok, when you come our of the airport you can find your cars in the car park

135
00:08:05,697 --> 00:08:07,165
-Yes... -What, what?

136
00:08:07,198 --> 00:08:08,032
Hurry, hurry.

137
00:08:08,032 --> 00:08:09,300
- Let's go! - Get lost!

138
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,668
- Hey hurry, hurry. - Hey. get lost!

139
00:08:10,668 --> 00:08:11,702
Where?

140
00:08:12,003 --> 00:08:13,704
-Where? -Where?

141
00:08:34,757 --> 00:08:37,059
It's fine, as long as there's Da Hae. everything's fine.

142
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:38,761
- We don't anything else. Hey. - It's enough, it's enough.

143
00:08:38,761 --> 00:08:41,763
I swear, you're the most beautiful celebrities I've ever seen.

144
00:08:41,763 --> 00:08:45,500
Oppa was very happy when you saw Son Ye Jin sunbae.

145
00:08:45,667 --> 00:08:48,336
- You really liked her. - You have to know this about Ye Jin.

146
00:08:48,336 --> 00:08:50,805
Her style is the sort that's rather easy to get tired of.

147
00:08:52,774 --> 00:08:55,643
What sort of style does Da Hae's ideal type have?

148
00:08:55,643 --> 00:08:56,344
For me...

149
00:08:56,344 --> 00:08:58,812
- You wouldn't be so childish as to say the tall sort right? - Right.

150
00:08:58,812 --> 00:08:59,947
It's too childish.

151
00:08:59,947 --> 00:09:01,915
An understanding man.

152
00:09:01,915 --> 00:09:03,584
-I can understand everything! -I understand everything!

153
00:09:03,584 --> 00:09:06,753
I understand it all!

154
00:09:06,987 --> 00:09:09,389
Also, he must have leadership qualities.

155
00:09:09,389 --> 00:09:10,757
Hey, go this way!

156
00:09:10,757 --> 00:09:11,791
I said go this way!

157
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:13,493
That's not it.

158
00:09:13,493 --> 00:09:15,895
"Let's eat. let's do this, let's go there", things like this.

159
00:09:15,895 --> 00:09:17,163
Good.

160
00:09:17,163 --> 00:09:18,164
I like you.

161
00:09:18,164 --> 00:09:20,032
Everything about you.

162
00:09:20,432 --> 00:09:21,900
Oppa has money.

163
00:09:24,303 --> 00:09:25,771
Go!

164
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:28,073
I don't need anything.

165
00:09:28,073 --> 00:09:32,210
- He's a bit lost. - Could you try to understand oppa.

166
00:09:34,145 --> 00:09:35,613
Beside us there. There, there.

167
00:09:35,646 --> 00:09:37,181
- Gwang Soo. - There, there.

168
00:09:38,549 --> 00:09:42,386
Gwang Soo, he's seriously very frightened.

169
00:09:48,158 --> 00:09:49,959
The sound of the car's a little loud.

170
00:09:49,959 --> 00:09:53,763
- Is there something wrong? - No, why is the RPM rising so much?

171
00:09:53,763 --> 00:09:56,732
The car's gear is not shifting, that's why.

172
00:09:56,732 --> 00:09:59,101
The car's sound is even louder that hyung's voice.

173
00:09:59,568 --> 00:10:01,103
This car.,.

174
00:10:01,103 --> 00:10:03,038
Why is this car like this?

175
00:10:03,038 --> 00:10:04,439
You're in manual now.

176
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:12,280
Sorry.

177
00:10:12,914 --> 00:10:16,484
- Why were there sounds? - Up till now the car has been in first gear.

178
00:10:16,884 --> 00:10:19,620
- Is it? - A car this quiet...

179
00:10:20,254 --> 00:10:23,590
Ah! It's the sea! The sea!

180
00:10:25,192 --> 00:10:26,793
It's so pretty.

181
00:10:31,197 --> 00:10:31,998
Oh. it's there!

182
00:10:32,165 --> 00:10:33,967
This should be our first mission location.

183
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:34,667
- This should be our first mission location. - Really?

184
00:10:34,667 --> 00:10:36,135
Yes. yes,

185
00:10:40,539 --> 00:10:42,508
- Da Hael - Yes?

186
00:10:43,676 --> 00:10:46,011
I really can't live anymore.

187
00:10:46,311 --> 00:10:48,780
Please let me be alone.

188
00:11:15,872 --> 00:11:19,308
Oh! Quickly, quickly.

189
00:11:19,308 --> 00:11:20,209
Wah-

190
00:11:21,644 --> 00:11:22,778
Oh, it's outside!

191
00:11:22,778 --> 00:11:24,146
Why is it so cold?

192
00:11:24,146 --> 00:11:25,414
It's cold!

193
00:11:26,415 --> 00:11:28,050
What are we doing here?

194
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:29,684
It's cold!

195
00:11:29,684 --> 00:11:31,720
Is there a mission?

196
00:11:32,187 --> 00:11:34,522
Please kick the shuttlecocks in the cold bath.

197
00:11:34,522 --> 00:11:37,692
-If the members kick a total of 10 times and above it is a pass. -Let's get going! Quickly quickly!

198
00:11:37,692 --> 00:11:39,694
- Fighting! - Fighting!

199
00:11:41,095 --> 00:11:42,163
1.2...

200
00:11:42,763 --> 00:11:44,598
You can't do it like that.

201
00:11:44,832 --> 00:11:46,333
Do we have to go in here?

202
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:47,734
Please step in.

203
00:11:56,876 --> 00:11:58,244
Use this, use this!

204
00:11:58,244 --> 00:12:00,613
A 3 man team is an advantage.

205
00:12:00,613 --> 00:12:02,882
You should have stood in front of number 1 or 3.

206
00:12:04,183 --> 00:12:06,952
I heard Da Hae's height is 170.

207
00:12:06,952 --> 00:12:09,521
No, she's 175. What are you saying?

208
00:12:09,655 --> 00:12:12,023
-She's 170 yet she's the tallest out of them. -She's 175!

209
00:12:12,023 --> 00:12:14,392
-Then you're not 170! - I'm 170!

210
00:12:14,392 --> 00:12:15,593
What's your height?

211
00:12:15,593 --> 00:12:17,061
-170, -It's 175.

212
00:12:17,262 --> 00:12:20,498
175.173,170. No, 169.

213
00:12:20,498 --> 00:12:22,600
You are shorter than me!

214
00:12:25,169 --> 00:12:27,071
Maintain your balance.

215
00:12:29,072 --> 00:12:31,708
-One. only one. - Are you joking?

216
00:12:32,142 --> 00:12:33,710
Joking?

217
00:12:34,277 --> 00:12:36,146
-Only 1? -Tell him you're 175,

218
00:12:36,146 --> 00:12:39,716
Da Hae. you are not a spy right?

219
00:12:48,023 --> 00:12:49,758
There is a spy in this game too?

220
00:12:49,758 --> 00:12:52,160
Her expression is weird.

221
00:12:52,294 --> 00:12:54,696
Are you trying to make their team fail?

222
00:12:54,696 --> 00:12:56,164
It is because the games are like these.

223
00:12:56,197 --> 00:12:59,934
-We have to be alert in this game! -I really don't know anything.

224
00:13:00,368 --> 00:13:02,703
You obviously know it.

225
00:13:05,372 --> 00:13:08,108
It feels a little like X-Man now,

226
00:13:08,242 --> 00:13:11,078
Standing like that,.. You are the X-Man'right?

227
00:13:11,478 --> 00:13:12,913
You are the X-Man.

228
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,214
Yoon Eun Hye!

229
00:13:14,581 --> 00:13:17,417
Don't do this! I'm really...

230
00:13:17,417 --> 00:13:21,054
I asked you not to do this. Why are all of you like that?

231
00:13:21,054 --> 00:13:23,723
I miss you, Eun Hye.

232
00:13:32,898 --> 00:13:34,966
I must eliminate them.

233
00:13:35,767 --> 00:13:37,535
I must tear them off. tear them off!

234
00:13:37,535 --> 00:13:39,270
I am really going crazy.

235
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:40,605
This is the best in history.

236
00:13:44,642 --> 00:13:45,376
The short one.

237
00:13:45,376 --> 00:13:46,744
Oh...

238
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:53,250
-What are you doing? - What are you doing? What are you doing now?

239
00:13:53,283 --> 00:13:56,553
The shorter this is, the less water it will carry.

240
00:13:56,553 --> 00:13:59,722
Kim Jong Kook! Kim Jong Kook!

241
00:14:04,694 --> 00:14:06,162
Your leg,..

242
00:14:06,162 --> 00:14:07,863
Oppa, you will have a cramp.

243
00:14:07,863 --> 00:14:08,864
No. it's okay.

244
00:14:11,834 --> 00:14:12,434
1...

245
00:14:12,534 --> 00:14:13,302
Ah. 2 times?

246
00:14:15,737 --> 00:14:19,741
-I really can't watch this anymore. -It's really embarrassing! Really!

247
00:14:20,842 --> 00:14:23,711
He stretched his whole body like that.

248
00:14:24,812 --> 00:14:26,247
-Gwang Soo. what should you do? -Kook!

249
00:14:26,247 --> 00:14:27,782
-Soo! (Kook Soo is noodles in Korean) -Eat!

250
00:14:27,982 --> 00:14:29,183
-Kook! -Soo!

251
00:14:32,019 --> 00:14:34,221
Slower, slower. Noodles, eat.

252
00:14:34,221 --> 00:14:35,422
1!

253
00:14:39,859 --> 00:14:41,060
It's our turn.

254
00:14:42,662 --> 00:14:43,663
Well done.

255
00:14:45,164 --> 00:14:45,965
I'm sorry.

256
00:14:45,965 --> 00:14:49,735
Our VJ dongsaeng was like this just now...

257
00:14:50,436 --> 00:14:52,271
Why are you like his?

258
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:54,706
Fighting!

259
00:14:55,207 --> 00:14:57,742
I really hope I can hit twice.

260
00:14:57,876 --> 00:14:59,344
Tok. tok. kick it like that.

261
00:14:59,444 --> 00:15:02,814
Why are you holding him when Da Hae is kicking?

262
00:15:02,814 --> 00:15:04,715
Let me wipe your foot for you.

263
00:15:05,917 --> 00:15:08,185
-Done. -Gary oppa. you should stand there.

264
00:15:08,185 --> 00:15:09,420
That's right.

265
00:15:10,521 --> 00:15:13,724
-Like this! Not bad! -2! 2 right!

266
00:15:13,857 --> 00:15:15,359
-2. -Fighting!

267
00:15:15,659 --> 00:15:17,394
1,2...

268
00:15:17,394 --> 00:15:18,762
4! 4!

269
00:15:18,762 --> 00:15:19,863
1,2...

270
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:22,699
-4! 4! -4! 4! 4!

271
00:15:22,999 --> 00:15:24,233
Da da da da!

272
00:15:25,201 --> 00:15:26,135
Da da da da!

273
00:15:26,135 --> 00:15:27,970
You just need to kick 4 more times.

274
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:29,705
-That'sit. -Fighting!

275
00:15:29,872 --> 00:15:32,708
-Hyung, you see. .Never give up till the end. -Fighting! Fighting! Fighting!

276
00:15:33,208 --> 00:15:35,711
Wipe it. Wipe your foot first.

277
00:15:35,944 --> 00:15:37,446
Just use this...

278
00:15:46,454 --> 00:15:47,521
4! 4!

279
00:15:47,521 --> 00:15:50,724
I realize you are the very obedient type.

280
00:15:54,094 --> 00:15:54,995
No...

281
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:56,496
Do it quickly!

282
00:15:56,496 --> 00:15:59,432
This also looks like what we did in X-Man before,

283
00:15:59,432 --> 00:16:01,001
Jong Kook, did you do all these to Eun Hye?

284
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:02,702
Ah! Why are you like this?

285
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:05,271
Like this...

286
00:16:06,472 --> 00:16:08,040
-4! -1! Ah!

287
00:16:12,278 --> 00:16:13,712
We have to do well.

288
00:16:13,712 --> 00:16:15,814
Why can't I do it?

289
00:16:15,814 --> 00:16:17,816
Can I kick 10 times in one go?

290
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:21,186
2! 3, 3!

291
00:16:22,253 --> 00:16:23,521
Ah, you really can't do it.

292
00:16:23,521 --> 00:16:25,290
You have to kick it well.

293
00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:28,292
Gwang Soo, you have to say something.

294
00:16:28,292 --> 00:16:29,760
Why can't you express yourself?

295
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:32,263
You saw how hyung did it. right?

296
00:16:32,263 --> 00:16:34,698
You obviously can't do it like that, Gwang Soo.

297
00:16:44,774 --> 00:16:47,443
Jong Kook, he didn't mean it. He made a mistake.

298
00:16:49,478 --> 00:16:52,248
He didn't do it on purpose. Jong Kook, he didn't mean it.

299
00:16:53,249 --> 00:16:54,216
Are you alright, hyung.

300
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:58,520
Jong Kook has the look in his eyes.

301
00:16:58,987 --> 00:17:01,223
-Hyung, I will definitely do better next. -You come here first.

302
00:17:01,223 --> 00:17:02,891
Our turn.

303
00:17:04,993 --> 00:17:06,294
-Start. -Fighting!

304
00:17:06,294 --> 00:17:08,696
1.2.3.4.

305
00:17:09,197 --> 00:17:11,899
1.2.3.4.

306
00:17:11,899 --> 00:17:13,567
5,6.

307
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:24,677
7 times, then Da Hae and Dong Hoon kick only once and they'll fail.

308
00:17:24,911 --> 00:17:27,680
Just do it. It's as good as done. Be at ease.

309
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,015
1.2.

310
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:34,653
-I only need to kick once. -Only 1.

311
00:17:34,653 --> 00:17:38,457
-Only 1. -Maybe you can't even kick once.

312
00:17:38,457 --> 00:17:40,058
We've won. We've won.

313
00:17:41,493 --> 00:17:42,194
Dong Hoon!

314
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:43,361
1.

315
00:17:46,197 --> 00:17:47,799
How did you kick 7 times?

316
00:17:50,535 --> 00:17:52,803
What's that? It's cold, let's go quickly!

317
00:17:52,803 --> 00:17:53,971
Bye.

318
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:57,541
We will definitely have no problems.

319
00:17:57,541 --> 00:17:59,710
Get it? Kick confidently.

320
00:18:02,479 --> 00:18:04,581
Yes, like that! 5!

321
00:18:05,715 --> 00:18:07,617
Yes, like that! 5!

322
00:18:08,885 --> 00:18:10,653
-Oppa you are too good! -You all saw it right?

323
00:18:10,653 --> 00:18:12,655
It's done! It's done!

324
00:18:12,655 --> 00:18:14,590
Like this!

325
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:16,659
There's definitely no problem!

326
00:18:17,292 --> 00:18:18,794
Yeah-We're done!

327
00:18:18,794 --> 00:18:20,862
-Why can't I? -You just have to kick twice.

328
00:18:20,862 --> 00:18:22,564
This is indeed a little difficult.

329
00:18:27,202 --> 00:18:27,969
Ah. 4.

330
00:18:27,969 --> 00:18:31,172
We can do 4 times,

331
00:18:31,172 --> 00:18:32,306
Oppa. I'm sorry!

332
00:18:32,306 --> 00:18:33,607
It's alright.

333
00:18:33,607 --> 00:18:34,508
Ji Hyo. it's alright.

334
00:18:34,508 --> 00:18:36,577
-You can do it. -I can kick 4 times,

335
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:37,645
Aja!

336
00:18:38,212 --> 00:18:40,614
4 times! 4 times! You just have to-kick 4 times!

337
00:18:42,249 --> 00:18:44,150
1,2.3.

338
00:18:46,419 --> 00:18:47,620
1 more time!

339
00:18:49,889 --> 00:18:51,157
1 more time!

340
00:18:57,363 --> 00:18:58,364
We did it!

341
00:18:58,364 --> 00:18:59,364
Let's go.

342
00:19:00,999 --> 00:19:01,833
Let's go.

343
00:19:04,136 --> 00:19:05,804
You saw it right, you saw it right.

344
00:19:06,338 --> 00:19:08,072
Why didn't you do it with me?

345
00:19:12,410 --> 00:19:14,045
What's with this? It's so strange.

346
00:19:14,045 --> 00:19:15,946
Oh. it's too difficult.

347
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:17,681
What are all of you doing there?

348
00:19:21,084 --> 00:19:23,587
-This is for Dae Hae. -Ok. I get it.

349
00:19:23,887 --> 00:19:26,222
-Thank you. -You're really too much.

350
00:19:26,956 --> 00:19:29,092
Break the falling balloons.

351
00:19:29,092 --> 00:19:30,893
Hit more than 30 balloons to pass.

352
00:19:30,893 --> 00:19:32,562
-Ok! Ok! -What?

353
00:19:33,262 --> 00:19:35,197
We have to hit the thing falling from above?

354
00:19:35,197 --> 00:19:37,600
Kim Jong Kook is very good at this.

355
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,568
Gary also did boxing.

356
00:19:40,569 --> 00:19:42,137
-Fighting! -Fighting!

357
00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:48,309
Oh, what is that?

358
00:19:50,912 --> 00:19:52,580
-Are you all ready? -Yes.

359
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,882
Start!

360
00:19:57,451 --> 00:19:58,085
Start!

361
00:20:06,092 --> 00:20:07,160
Mother!

362
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:10,196
As expected, the boxing Gary.

363
00:20:24,910 --> 00:20:26,812
Oh, I can't do this.

364
00:20:31,683 --> 00:20:34,252
Two, one. Stop!

365
00:20:36,087 --> 00:20:37,221
We're not bad,

366
00:20:37,221 --> 00:20:39,089
-There should be 30. -Did we get it?

367
00:20:39,089 --> 00:20:40,557
-Only 18? -Huh?

368
00:20:41,892 --> 00:20:43,160
Seems that they hit a lot?

369
00:20:43,193 --> 00:20:45,562
-They hit so many and only got 18? -This is only 18?

370
00:20:45,662 --> 00:20:47,197
This isn't easy.

371
00:20:47,597 --> 00:20:48,999
Ok, let's try it. 30!

372
00:20:49,165 --> 00:20:51,401
Fighting!

373
00:20:51,501 --> 00:20:53,569
-Ok, fighting. -Start!

374
00:20:54,537 --> 00:20:56,672
Open your eyes! Open your eyes!

375
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:00,209
Open your eyes! Open your eyes!

376
00:21:04,746 --> 00:21:06,348
Aigoo. where are they?

377
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:10,785
Suk Jin hyung can't even hit one,

378
00:21:51,289 --> 00:21:53,525
Suk Jin hyung keeps hitting home runs.

379
00:21:53,925 --> 00:21:55,793
-How many? -Ah, so scary!

380
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:58,062
I think we done it,

381
00:21:58,462 --> 00:22:00,765
-Wow, what a pity. -It was 26?

382
00:22:00,965 --> 00:22:03,867
-You had 26, so its a fail. -What a pity.

383
00:22:04,168 --> 00:22:05,402
Ok. I know what to do.

384
00:22:05,435 --> 00:22:07,204
-Ok. are you ready? -Yes.

385
00:22:07,204 --> 00:22:10,273
Ok. get ready. Start.

386
00:22:16,012 --> 00:22:18,214
Hey Jong Kook. Jong Kook.

387
00:22:20,349 --> 00:22:21,617
Hey. Kim Jong Kook.

388
00:22:25,821 --> 00:22:27,189
Hey, they're not falling on this side.

389
00:22:27,289 --> 00:22:28,623
-Hey, Gary... -He's no joke.

390
00:22:28,724 --> 00:22:30,392
He's like a kangaroo.

391
00:22:30,392 --> 00:22:33,561
Why are they always thrown to Gwang Soo?

392
00:22:35,863 --> 00:22:36,864
Ok.

393
00:22:40,101 --> 00:22:42,870
Gwang Soo. it won't do if you miss like this.

394
00:22:43,137 --> 00:22:45,739
It's out, Gwang Soo. Gwang Soo. no.

395
00:23:18,669 --> 00:23:21,505
Gwang Soo. it won't do if you miss like this.

396
00:23:21,706 --> 00:23:23,841
It's out. Gwang Soo, Gwang Soo. no.

397
00:23:25,175 --> 00:23:27,177
We'll reveal how many they got.

398
00:23:27,578 --> 00:23:29,646
-Did they get 30? -They got 29.

399
00:23:30,213 --> 00:23:31,214
Really?

400
00:23:31,681 --> 00:23:33,783
Hey, you hit all 29!

401
00:23:33,883 --> 00:23:36,586
Actually, Mr Lee Gwang Soo missed quite a few balloons.

402
00:23:36,586 --> 00:23:38,488
They wouldn't break even after I hit them!

403
00:23:38,554 --> 00:23:40,890
Gwang Soo. he even got in your way.

404
00:23:40,923 --> 00:23:41,791
Exactly.

405
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:43,893
-He did this to you. -Not like that.

406
00:23:46,362 --> 00:23:48,597
You guys are the ideal match.

407
00:23:48,664 --> 00:23:50,932
-Ah, why were you like this? -Kook!

408
00:23:51,166 --> 00:23:51,900
Soo!

409
00:23:51,967 --> 00:23:53,101
Cross!

410
00:23:56,237 --> 00:23:57,539
Start!

411
00:23:59,374 --> 00:24:02,243
Oh, oh, there's still a lot of time,

412
00:24:03,744 --> 00:24:07,047
-They haven't got any. There's no time. -You wasted the time.

413
00:24:07,381 --> 00:24:09,016
-They didn't break. -Hey. Lee Da Hae's doing well!

414
00:24:09,082 --> 00:24:10,317
Oh, Lee Da Hae's doing well.

415
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:30,235
-Da Hae's hitting all of them. -She's getting all of them.

416
00:24:30,335 --> 00:24:33,338
-Good Job. -Da Hae's getting them all.

417
00:24:36,908 --> 00:24:39,310
-It didn't break. -Da Hae, good job.

418
00:24:39,444 --> 00:24:40,978
Come forward a little!

419
00:24:48,052 --> 00:24:49,620
They didn't break,

420
00:24:49,653 --> 00:24:51,088
I really hit a lot.

421
00:24:51,121 --> 00:24:53,590
-I also hit a lot? -No. they didn't break.

422
00:24:55,292 --> 00:24:56,993

-That's already a lot. -They did it.

426
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:07,102
Miss Lee Da Hae hit 9 balloons, like Mr Gary.

427
00:25:07,169 --> 00:25:08,337
Ok. success!

00:25:08,337 --> 00:25:10,706

-Da Hae did well. -Looks like we can be first.

We did it.

431
00:25:18,747 --> 00:25:21,816
-Please go to the restaurant on the third floor. -Go, go! We have to go quickly.

432
00:25:22,216 --> 00:25:25,953
-Look, we must hurry. -Hey. looks likes we can be the first today,

433
00:25:25,986 --> 00:25:29,023
-Oppa. I did well right? -Oh. it was the best, the best.

434
00:25:29,890 --> 00:25:31,492
Wow. this is interesting.

00:25:31,925 --> 00:25:32,793
Start!

436
00:25:34,227 --> 00:25:35,562
Throw some this side too.

437
00:25:35,629 --> 00:25:39,399
-Oh, oh, it's not working again. -Gwang Soo's not hitting them, Gwang Soo can't do it.

438
00:25:40,633 --> 00:25:41,868
Oh. what's this?

439
00:25:44,237 --> 00:25:45,972
Hey, Gwang Soo,

Gwang Soo.

441
00:25:48,774 --> 00:25:51,043
Why is there so much water splashing on me?

442
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:52,911
Hey!

443
00:25:54,746 --> 00:25:58,483
Hey, Gwang Soo's hitting the water towards me.

444
00:26:11,028 --> 00:26:13,497
Hey. are you a kangaroo?

445
00:26:15,999 --> 00:26:18,301
Why are you spraying water on Jong Kook. Gwang Soo?

446

00:30:16,787 --> 00:30:19,390
Then what do we do. shall I go first?

531
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:22,392
-Look at my mouth, my mouth. -I got it. don't worry,

532
00:30:22,392 --> 00:30:25,262
-Get ready! -Oppa. oppa just has to get five.

533
00:30:25,262 --> 00:30:27,497
-Five, five! -Just five.

534
00:30:27,597 --> 00:30:28,832
Start!

535
00:30:28,865 --> 00:30:31,901
-♫Again and again and again♫ - 'Again and Again'!

536
00:30:31,968 --> 00:30:36,372
We keep going around and around

537
00:30:36,405 --> 00:30:39,041
Namee's 'Spin Spin'!

538
00:30:39,174 --> 00:30:42,477
-♫I've totally become a bird♫ -'Bird'!

539
00:30:42,577 --> 00:30:44,980
-'Bird'! -Yeah!

540
00:30:45,046 --> 00:30:47,615
Looking for food. In the valley.

541
00:30:47,749 --> 00:30:52,186
Leopard of Kilimanjaro!

542
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:57,458
Oh, friend forever

543
00:30:57,491 --> 00:31:01,061
-Do 'I promise you' Ji Hyo. -Oh, my friend forever.

544
00:31:04,798 --> 00:31:11,704
-♫Promise me♫ -Fin.K.L!

545
00:31:12,372 --> 00:31:14,774
Forever Love,

546
00:31:17,076 --> 00:31:19,111
We're done. We're doneiwe're done.

547
00:31:19,144 --> 00:31:20,212
-We succeeded? -Hey, we succeeded.

548
00:31:20,245 --> 00:31:21,847
Success!

549
00:31:24,249 --> 00:31:26,685
-We passed it in one try. -One try!

550
00:31:28,687 --> 00:31:30,555
The questions are too.easy.

551
00:31:30,588 --> 00:31:33,091
But how did you guess 'Leopard of Kilimanjaro'?

552
00:31:35,159 --> 00:31:37,161
Hey, how did you know 'Leopard of Kilimanjaro'?

553
00:31:37,561 --> 00:31:39,797
Panicking to find something to eat.

554
00:31:41,131 --> 00:31:43,333
Swishing in the wind,

555
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:49,372
I said 'looking for food' and he just guessed it.

556
00:31:49,506 --> 00:31:52,275
-It's a come from behind victory. -Ah. we were dead last.

557
00:31:52,342 --> 00:31:54,210
-From last to first. -I feel so good.

558
00:31:56,646 --> 00:31:58,881
-Hey. this is important. -Hey. how many are there?

559
00:31:58,981 --> 00:32:01,050
-This is really important. -First place is the best.

560
00:32:01,283 --> 00:32:02,618
Hey. how can it be so small?

561
00:32:02,651 --> 00:32:04,186
-Shall we have a look? -This isn't fair.

562
00:32:06,254 --> 00:32:08,190
-Why is first place so small? -Do we open it?

563
00:32:08,390 --> 00:32:10,091
-It's the best right? -Open it and see.

564
00:32:10,191 --> 00:32:13,861
-Can we open it now? -What's this? Is it a present?

565
00:32:13,861 --> 00:32:15,930
-Ours is the smallest. -Why is it so small?

566
00:32:15,930 --> 00:32:18,866
-It's name tags. -Oh. it's name tags?

567
00:32:19,366 --> 00:32:20,234
They are wings.

568
00:32:20,267 --> 00:32:22,436
-What's with the wings? -They have wings.

569
00:32:24,171 --> 00:32:26,506
Angels, you guys are angels.

570
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:29,376
-It's cute, cute. These are cute. -Hey. these guys.

571
00:32:32,045 --> 00:32:33,513
What is it. what is it?

572
00:32:33,546 --> 00:32:37,083
You're the best. The best comedy duo.

573
00:32:39,585 --> 00:32:41,754
You're going to fly.

574
00:32:42,054 --> 00:32:44,256
They'll fly,

575
00:32:44,289 --> 00:32:46,491
-They'll be wearing wings. -Aigoo. my stomach!

576
00:32:46,591 --> 00:32:48,693
-They'll, they'll fly. -Ah. my stomach.

577
00:32:48,693 --> 00:32:50,929
Hey, you have to walk. You'll fly if you run.

578
00:32:53,498 --> 00:32:54,832
It looks quite good.

579
00:32:54,832 --> 00:32:56,834
-He's going to fly. he's going to fly. Ah. it's cute!

580
00:32:56,901 --> 00:32:58,469
Like this, rip!

581
00:32:58,869 --> 00:33:00,805
-No. oppa. -Hey. we can do this today!

582
00:33:00,805 --> 00:33:04,374
-Oppa. put it on his shoulders. -That's not it, look at Jong Kook,

583
00:33:04,508 --> 00:33:06,977
-Oh. really... -Jong Kookie's an angel.

584
00:33:07,577 --> 00:33:10,180
Look at the wings on his shoulders from the side.

585
00:33:10,347 --> 00:33:12,949
Ok. then we'II tell you the final mission now.

586
00:33:13,183 --> 00:33:16,652
Today's final mission, is to find the Spy.

587
00:33:16,686 --> 00:33:19,021
What?

588
00:33:19,155 --> 00:33:22,591
-There's a Spy? -There's a Spy amongst you.

589
00:33:23,058 --> 00:33:25,661
-What's this again? -Then, it's Da Hae!

590
00:33:25,861 --> 00:33:28,764
Find the Spy before he succeeds in the mission and get him out.

591
00:33:28,864 --> 00:33:31,199
-I knew it. -A Spy?

592
00:33:31,233 --> 00:33:36,237
Ok now, Team 1 will enter the mission venue first.

593
00:33:50,550 --> 00:33:54,187
What... who. who is the Spy? Huh?

594
00:33:57,757 --> 00:34:02,061
Hey, it's really, really a;huge place.

595
00:34:13,838 --> 00:34:16,407
But. what do we do now?

596
00:34:17,008 --> 00:34:19,710
We can't tear off each other's name tags.

597
00:34:19,877 --> 00:34:22,747
What's the mission?

598
00:34:22,747 --> 00:34:26,550
They're working, even though it's a rest day. Hello.

599
00:34:27,151 --> 00:34:29,620
They're here for work.

600
00:34:29,786 --> 00:34:34,190
Do the people here have, some mission?

601
00:34:34,391 --> 00:34:35,758
No?

602
00:34:38,995 --> 00:34:39,796
What did you say?

603
00:34:39,896 --> 00:34:41,264
-Please come with me. -But, why?

604
00:34:42,665 --> 00:34:46,035
What is it? Are you making me the Spy again now? Huh?

605
00:34:47,269 --> 00:34:49,137
I won't be the Spy.

606
00:34:49,204 --> 00:34:51,807
I, don't want to.

607
00:34:53,508 --> 00:34:54,609
But. why again...

608
00:34:58,246 --> 00:35:00,515
Ah. this is seriously...

609
00:35:06,287 --> 00:35:07,855
Ah, this again...

610
00:35:11,058 --> 00:35:13,193
You want to make me the Spy now?

611
00:35:15,261 --> 00:35:18,364
Why are you doing this, seriously? This is just...

612
00:35:18,431 --> 00:35:21,367
Jeez, if you want me to do it again.

613
00:35:21,501 --> 00:35:24,236
Well this once.... I'll do it again.

614
00:35:24,437 --> 00:35:26,438
I'll just do the mission.

615
00:35:27,539 --> 00:35:28,574
What is it?

616
00:35:30,242 --> 00:35:31,276
Huh?

617
00:35:36,448 --> 00:35:39,350
I have to find the employee with the R sticker on them?

618
00:35:40,184 --> 00:35:42,687
Rendezvous with the employee with the R sticker on them.

619
00:35:42,887 --> 00:35:43,588
And then?

620
00:35:43,654 --> 00:35:48,292
Then when you find him. carry out a task.

621
00:35:48,459 --> 00:35:50,794
You can't let the rest find out about the missions.

622
00:35:50,861 --> 00:35:55,465
Hence, you have to complete three stages of missions.

623
00:35:55,532 --> 00:35:56,933
I'm really going crazy.

624
00:35:58,601 --> 00:36:00,270
What do I do?

625
00:36:00,670 --> 00:36:02,939
Don't be like this, give me a water gun.

626
00:36:03,005 --> 00:36:04,206
I can't do this.

627
00:36:04,373 --> 00:36:08,077
If it's like this, I'll be exposed right away. I'll be exposed.

628
00:36:08,510 --> 00:36:12,147
Today. I don't have the rhythm. I shouldn't be the Spy now.

629
00:36:12,281 --> 00:36:13,582
They will suspect me right away.

630
00:36:13,682 --> 00:36:16,885
They'll say "It should be Jae Suk hyung's turn to be the Spy".

631
00:36:16,985 --> 00:36:19,521
When I heard it I thought I should be the Spy too.

632
00:36:19,621 --> 00:36:21,389
Like what I said. Ok?

633
00:36:21,389 --> 00:36:24,392
-Also, listen to what I have to say... -Ah firstly. I don't know.

634
00:36:24,458 --> 00:36:27,661
Well. I'll work hard, I can't do anything if it doesn't work.

635
00:36:27,761 --> 00:36:30,097
This is bad.

636
00:36:30,697 --> 00:36:33,133
I'm not confident. I'm not confident about this.

637
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:41,641
Seriously...

638
00:36:42,275 --> 00:36:44,644
You be careful, we can't expose ourselves.

639
00:36:44,777 --> 00:36:47,046
Find the employee with the R sticker.

640
00:36:47,713 --> 00:36:50,382
Someone with the R on them.

641
00:36:51,517 --> 00:36:52,718
This is bad.

642
00:37:01,859 --> 00:37:04,362
Why am I going in alone?

643
00:37:07,331 --> 00:37:09,300
Oppa, when did you come?

644
00:37:09,366 --> 00:37:12,136
I was the first person to come in.

645
00:37:12,269 --> 00:37:16,006
-Oppa, I thought we'd come in together. -No. they made us come in. one at a time.

646
00:37:16,606 --> 00:37:19,409
-Individually? -Individually.

647
00:37:20,076 --> 00:37:23,646
-Oppa, do you want to tear mine off now? -Why would I tear yours off?

648
00:37:23,813 --> 00:37:25,915
-I'm not the Spy, oppa. -I know.

649
00:37:26,382 --> 00:37:29,318
Because you've been the Spy recently.

650
00:37:29,418 --> 00:37:32,321
-Actually I suspect oppa. -Why?

651
00:37:32,421 --> 00:37:34,089
Oppa hasn't been a spy. for a while.

652
00:37:34,156 --> 00:37:38,593
You're saying that based on me not being a Spy for awhile,

653
00:37:45,733 --> 00:37:47,835
Miss Ji Hyo. please come this way,

654
00:37:47,968 --> 00:37:50,704
There's an exit here.

655
00:37:50,771 --> 00:37:54,308
In the past, we really ran a lot in the emergency exits.

656
00:37:57,144 --> 00:37:58,945
Omo!

657
00:38:04,017 --> 00:38:06,052
Oh. oh!

658
00:38:21,766 --> 00:38:24,335
You are the Spy,

659
00:38:29,707 --> 00:38:35,145
From now on. rendezvous with the secret agent to accept the task you have to carry out.

660
00:38:35,145 --> 00:38:41,017
Look for the employee with the R sticker on their body and recite the password.

661
00:38:41,217 --> 00:38:46,255
Blooming flowers on Dongbaekseom

662
00:39:01,536 --> 00:39:05,773
My heart is pounding again.

663
00:39:17,918 --> 00:39:20,153
How do I act this out?

664
00:39:20,153 --> 00:39:23,256
Oh. I'm very bad at this, what do I do?

665
00:39:24,157 --> 00:39:25,258
Where is it?

666
00:39:31,564 --> 00:39:34,400
I believe I can fly

667
00:39:37,603 --> 00:39:38,370
Here?

668
00:39:38,971 --> 00:39:42,007
I believe I can touch the sky

669
00:39:48,946 --> 00:39:50,848
What's this about now?

670
00:39:51,182 --> 00:39:55,085
Really, when I came in. my heart almost stopped beating.

671
00:39:59,289 --> 00:40:00,891
You are a spy

672
00:40:05,195 --> 00:40:07,297
Because the fast time was a shame

673
00:40:07,397 --> 00:40:09,165
Although it was a shame, thank you

674
00:40:09,165 --> 00:40:12,101
-We want you to do it again. -No one would suspect it.

675
00:40:12,101 --> 00:40:16,005
The production team has the brain,

676
00:40:17,306 --> 00:40:18,941
R sticker. Is it Running Man?

677
00:40:21,276 --> 00:40:26,414
Ha Dong Hoon who a has good feeling is catching the spy.

678
00:40:26,548 --> 00:40:28,650
It's definitely not me.

679
00:40:37,658 --> 00:40:42,362
Why haven't you say anything? I have been waiting.

680
00:40:44,197 --> 00:40:45,598
I have been waiting.

681
00:40:48,334 --> 00:40:51,037
Thank you very much, teacher

682
00:40:55,141 --> 00:40:56,308
What is this?

683
00:41:19,897 --> 00:41:23,533
Like this. I'm in the middle of being a spy again?

684
00:41:24,834 --> 00:41:26,436
I understand

685
00:41:29,505 --> 00:41:31,507
I waited for a very long time.

686
00:41:39,081 --> 00:41:40,415
I'll do my best.

687
00:41:47,789 --> 00:41:50,191
The shadow is very cool, right? Looks like an angel.

688
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:55,529
The shadow looks like an angel

689
00:41:57,198 --> 00:42:00,534
Mind control, mind control.

690
00:42:00,734 --> 00:42:03,136
It's crazy.

691
00:42:03,537 --> 00:42:08,942
I don't know what to make of all this. I can't think of anything.

692
00:42:09,075 --> 00:42:13,846
I shouldn't make any mistake.

693
00:42:28,993 --> 00:42:31,763
There seems to be somebody over there.

694
00:42:32,130 --> 00:42:34,132
There is somebody over there.

695
00:42:34,232 --> 00:42:36,167
Enemies everywhere

696
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:38,235
Because I live alone in this world.

697
00:42:38,702 --> 00:42:41,972
I will eliminate all of them!

698
00:43:01,490 --> 00:43:04,059
Hello

699
00:43:06,862 --> 00:43:10,198
I didn't do something wrong, right?

700
00:43:11,199 --> 00:43:13,801
Today's mission is different from the others.

701
00:43:18,339 --> 00:43:22,609
You are not a spy. Eliminate all the spies.

702
00:43:27,547 --> 00:43:30,016
How many people are spies?

703
00:43:30,083 --> 00:43:35,988
Today. everyone is a spy but Lee Da Hae.

704
00:43:36,656 --> 00:43:38,357
Then...

705
00:43:38,391 --> 00:43:42,494
Da Hae wins if all the spies are eliminated.

706
00:43:42,494 --> 00:43:44,496
How do I do it?

707
00:43:45,063 --> 00:43:46,365
Rip their name tags.

708
00:43:46,765 --> 00:43:49,334
All 7 people?

709
00:43:51,236 --> 00:43:53,137
What to do?

710
00:43:53,204 --> 00:43:57,275
Later in Busan. I will give separate instruction to the members to be spies.

711
00:43:58,175 --> 00:44:04,281
Then they will think they're the only spies and do the spy mission.

712
00:44:04,314 --> 00:44:09,920
Miss Lee Da Hae can eliminate them one by one to become the winner.

713
00:44:09,953 --> 00:44:14,357
I can just tear it right? As soon as I see them?

714
00:44:14,557 --> 00:44:17,160
This is really...

715
00:44:18,661 --> 00:44:22,364
Can you give me a little help?

716
00:44:23,632 --> 00:44:25,400
I'll do my best.

717
00:44:26,268 --> 00:44:28,603
I'M.do my best! Fighting!

718
00:44:40,648 --> 00:44:42,850
Enemies are everywhere

719
00:44:42,917 --> 00:44:47,221
Since I live alone in this world. I will eliminate all of them!

720
00:44:49,589 --> 00:44:51,191
Everyone is a spy, right?

721
00:45:12,911 --> 00:45:15,046
When did you come?

722
00:45:15,146 --> 00:45:16,848
I came last.

723
00:45:16,914 --> 00:45:19,417
-This is making me crazy! -What are you doing, hyung?

724
00:45:19,450 --> 00:45:23,187
Hey, Da Hae is very strange!

725
00:45:23,287 --> 00:45:25,856
-She's very strange -But if Da Hae noona is a spy,

726
00:45:25,956 --> 00:45:27,991
-It's very predictable. -It's very predictable!

727
00:45:40,836 --> 00:45:43,339
Kim Jong Kook looks cool!

728
00:45:44,039 --> 00:45:46,342
It's like you're really flying

729
00:45:46,342 --> 00:45:49,244
-It's not bad right? -Oppa. it really suits you.

730
00:45:51,980 --> 00:45:54,916
Hey. who is it today?

731
00:45:55,150 --> 00:45:58,152
Oppa. today Gwang Soo is acting strange?

732
00:45:58,252 --> 00:46:01,088
Gwang Soo is acting bit strange. Gwang Soo is suspicious.

733
00:46:01,389 --> 00:46:03,791
-I think so too. -Gwang Soo is suspicious...

734
00:46:05,793 --> 00:46:07,194
Gwang Soo is a bit strange.

735
00:46:07,194 --> 00:46:11,098
-What about Lee Da Hae? -Lee Da Hae is a bit...

736
00:46:14,134 --> 00:46:19,605
Anyway, you need to be careful. If you stay in one location, you might get eliminated.

737
00:46:19,772 --> 00:46:21,707
I'm busy looking around,

738
00:46:21,774 --> 00:46:23,476
-You are window shopping? -Yes. I am

739
00:46:23,476 --> 00:46:25,277
l did a little too.

740
00:46:38,089 --> 00:46:40,558
R sticker.

741
00:46:41,092 --> 00:46:44,095
Do-you know the The flower Dongbaekseom?

742
00:46:47,097 --> 00:46:49,967
How do I look for him in this huge place?

743
00:46:56,339 --> 00:46:58,408
I think I have to just try.

744
00:46:58,541 --> 00:46:59,676
Hello.

745
00:47:00,209 --> 00:47:05,448
Blooming flowers on Dongbaekseom

746
00:47:05,848 --> 00:47:09,418
Is where spring arrived

747
00:47:17,292 --> 00:47:18,793
This is really...

748
00:47:29,069 --> 00:47:37,277
Blooming flowers on Dongbaekseom is where spring arrived

749
00:47:39,245 --> 00:47:40,179
I'm sorry.

750
00:47:50,789 --> 00:47:52,691
Oh? It is Da Hae.

751
00:47:54,593 --> 00:47:55,760
Da Hae.

752
00:47:56,194 --> 00:47:57,195
Yes. oppa?

753
00:47:57,429 --> 00:48:01,099
-Earlier, why did you do that during the game? -Doing what?

754
00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:04,202
Earlier you look like a spy.

755
00:48:04,368 --> 00:48:06,504
-Me? -Yes.

756
00:48:06,671 --> 00:48:08,305
No?

757
00:48:09,907 --> 00:48:12,609
What are you doing?

758
00:48:13,410 --> 00:48:14,745
What have you been doing, oppa?

759
00:48:14,811 --> 00:48:16,813
-I have been looking, of course? -Looking for what?

760
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:21,017
I heard there's a Spy here, so I've been wandering around.

761
00:48:21,251 --> 00:48:23,820
There's a spy?

762
00:48:24,554 --> 00:48:26,789
Da Hae is not a spy. right?

763
00:48:26,789 --> 00:48:28,791
If you are a spy, you are very obvious!

764
00:48:29,892 --> 00:48:33,462
Actually, I don't know what I have to do now.

765
00:48:34,329 --> 00:48:36,865
You don't know what to do, Da Hae?

766
00:48:36,865 --> 00:48:38,800
I don't know.

767
00:48:38,867 --> 00:48:41,970
If you are a spy, you totally fail.

768
00:48:42,770 --> 00:48:43,738
Why is that?

769
00:48:43,771 --> 00:48:47,308
-Because you are very obvious for a spy. -Me?

770
00:48:48,109 --> 00:48:51,478
-You are not a spy. right? -Are you a spy?

771
00:48:53,514 --> 00:48:55,015
Of course I am not.

772
00:48:58,652 --> 00:49:00,920
I'll see you later.

773
00:49:08,594 --> 00:49:11,563
What is she now?

774
00:49:11,830 --> 00:49:14,700
What is Da Hae?

775
00:49:29,113 --> 00:49:30,347
Olivia, where are you going?

776
00:49:31,282 --> 00:49:33,884
Just looking around.

777
00:49:33,951 --> 00:49:36,086
What are you trying to find?

778
00:49:39,656 --> 00:49:40,790
Where are you going?

779
00:49:55,604 --> 00:49:58,507
Oppa is also that?

780
00:49:59,107 --> 00:50:00,575
Then, you too?

781
00:50:01,409 --> 00:50:05,747
Then from what I see, there are 2 spies.

782
00:50:15,255 --> 00:50:15,989
Don't get caught.

783
00:50:16,056 --> 00:50:17,291
Da Hae. you cannot be caught,

784
00:50:17,291 --> 00:50:19,292
-We must quickly eliminate them. -Don't talk to me. just walk straight quickly.

785
00:50:19,359 --> 00:50:21,261
Don't even look at me, understand?

786
00:50:21,494 --> 00:50:22,829
We must eliminate them quickly.

787
00:50:22,862 --> 00:50:23,496
Ok.

788
00:50:23,630 --> 00:50:24,430
The rest of them.

789
00:50:24,464 --> 00:50:26,532
Ok, We can't meet each other again.

790
00:50:26,566 --> 00:50:29,368
-Try not to... The flowers bloom... -Oppa...

791
00:50:29,769 --> 00:50:31,003
Just kill them.

792
00:50:31,103 --> 00:50:31,804
Ok.

793
00:50:34,373 --> 00:50:37,676
Will he kill them? I think he trusts me.

794
00:50:42,213 --> 00:50:43,782
Wow... Really...

795
00:50:46,985 --> 00:50:52,056
I was wondering, how can we be singing the same song?

796
00:50:57,661 --> 00:51:00,163
Can I have a sheet of paper? Thank you.

797
00:51:00,997 --> 00:51:05,168
I have to look like I'm not a spy. a little alibi,

798
00:51:09,138 --> 00:51:10,106
Gwang Soo!

799
00:51:10,907 --> 00:51:11,907
What are you doing?

800
00:51:12,475 --> 00:51:13,642
I am doing some reasoning.

801
00:51:13,709 --> 00:51:14,176
What?

802
00:51:14,243 --> 00:51:15,311
I'm making deduction.

803
00:51:15,377 --> 00:51:16,311
Reasoning what?

804
00:51:16,478 --> 00:51:17,146
Spy.

805
00:51:17,780 --> 00:51:19,948
Hyung. what are these's staff doing?

806
00:51:20,015 --> 00:51:22,684
I also don't know! They wouldn't tell me!

807
00:51:22,851 --> 00:51:25,520
Why are there so many staffs. There are a lot.

808
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:27,155
It may be real staffs.

809
00:51:27,255 --> 00:51:29,991
But the strange thing is, there are also security guards and all.

810
00:51:30,191 --> 00:51:31,359
Ah. really?

811
00:51:38,899 --> 00:51:41,635
You go that side, I'll go this side.

812
00:51:52,245 --> 00:51:53,813
Like this... Like this?

813
00:51:54,814 --> 00:51:56,515
Like This... Like this?

814
00:51:56,682 --> 00:51:57,750
You go that side.

815
00:52:01,853 --> 00:52:03,555
I missed the timing!

816
00:52:03,922 --> 00:52:05,990
I tried to do it but he stared at me.

817
00:52:12,697 --> 00:52:13,431
Oppa!

818
00:52:13,531 --> 00:52:14,732
What's the situation like over at your side?

819
00:52:14,765 --> 00:52:15,432
Yes.

820
00:52:15,699 --> 00:52:17,668
- Gwang Soo is over there. - Where where where?

821
00:52:18,702 --> 00:52:19,670
Oppa!

822
00:52:19,803 --> 00:52:22,239
We must quickly eliminate them one by one,

823
00:52:22,639 --> 00:52:24,508
I can't do it myself.

824
00:52:30,380 --> 00:52:32,148
Oh? Gwang Soo oppa!

825
00:52:33,583 --> 00:52:34,784
You are a spy right?

826
00:52:35,017 --> 00:52:36,452
I have something to say to you. oppa.

827
00:52:36,852 --> 00:52:37,553
What?

828
00:52:39,388 --> 00:52:41,490
There's no one here I guess.

829
00:52:41,690 --> 00:52:43,592
Where is Gary hyung?

830
00:52:45,460 --> 00:52:49,097
For me... Up until now, after observing everyone's glances...

831
00:52:50,265 --> 00:52:51,799
The situation now looks like this, ,.

832
00:52:51,966 --> 00:52:55,269
It seems like the spies are oppa and myself.

833
00:52:55,970 --> 00:52:56,837
What?

834
00:52:58,205 --> 00:52:59,039
You're a spy?

835
00:53:00,974 --> 00:53:01,708
You're a spy?

836
00:53:22,294 --> 00:53:24,496
Quickly, quickly! Get rid of him!

837
00:53:26,731 --> 00:53:28,333
Gary oppa. fighting!

838
00:53:45,382 --> 00:53:48,718
Of course, he is a spy.

839
00:53:49,219 --> 00:53:50,787
As for Gary oppa,

840
00:53:51,921 --> 00:53:54,257
He thinks only the both of us are spies.

841
00:53:54,657 --> 00:53:56,092
In the end. by my hand, he will also...

842
00:53:56,359 --> 00:53:57,793
Get killed...

843
00:54:09,270 --> 00:54:10,238
Next one...

844
00:54:10,438 --> 00:54:11,873
Who is the next one?

845
00:54:11,906 --> 00:54:13,007
Don't let me catch you.

846
00:54:13,041 --> 00:54:15,143
I have confidence now!

847
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:23,750
Lee Gwang Soo out! Lee Gwang Soo. out!

848
00:54:25,152 --> 00:54:26,353
What is this?

849
00:54:26,953 --> 00:54:28,655
What is happening again?

850
00:54:29,689 --> 00:54:30,657
Hey...

851
00:54:44,102 --> 00:54:45,804
You should already know after coming here,

852
00:54:56,881 --> 00:54:58,716
Then the filming for today has ended?

853
00:55:02,453 --> 00:55:04,354
I am the spy.

854
00:55:24,373 --> 00:55:26,875
Blooming flowers

855
00:55:31,046 --> 00:55:36,284
Blooming flowers in Dongbaekseom...

856
00:55:36,484 --> 00:55:40,654
Is where spring arrived...

857
00:55:41,288 --> 00:55:42,489
Welcome!

858
00:55:42,489 --> 00:55:43,157
Oh, yes!

859
00:55:44,491 --> 00:55:45,492
Oh, yes!

860
00:55:47,561 --> 00:55:49,396
On the wrist.

861
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:54,434
Yes.

862
00:55:56,369 --> 00:55:58,237
Ok, I know. You've worked hard.

863
00:56:07,145 --> 00:56:08,847
Ah! I am really going crazy!

864
00:56:09,047 --> 00:56:11,449
After searching for half a day, I have to search again!

865
00:56:11,750 --> 00:56:14,953
Find the staff wearing a red scarf. The rendezvous code is "The one who controls the password!"

866
00:56:15,386 --> 00:56:16,921
Oh dear.

867
00:56:24,361 --> 00:56:26,430
I already said I didn't have a phone.

868
00:56:26,497 --> 00:56:27,865
Why did they give a mobile phone?

869
00:56:28,565 --> 00:56:30,634
If Jong Kook knows of this I'll be caught.

870
00:56:31,134 --> 00:56:33,103
If Jong Kook knows of this I'll be caught!

871
00:56:33,169 --> 00:56:35,004
Why did they suddenly give a mobile phone?

872
00:56:35,038 --> 00:56:37,173
I already told Jong Kook that I did not bring my mobile phone.

873
00:56:43,379 --> 00:56:44,280
Can you see it?

874
00:56:46,048 --> 00:56:47,149
Are you able to see it?

875
00:56:47,349 --> 00:56:48,383
You can see it, right?

876
00:56:51,353 --> 00:56:52,721
Ah, I'm going crazy.

877
00:57:00,261 --> 00:57:01,629
Welcome.

878
00:57:11,071 --> 00:57:12,339
Welcome.

879
00:57:12,739 --> 00:57:13,840
Oh! It's correct?

880
00:57:14,307 --> 00:57:16,876
Oh! Thank you!

881
00:57:25,384 --> 00:57:26,919
This is really not an easy task.

882
00:57:26,952 --> 00:57:29,821
If anybody walks towards me from the back. I will feel uneasy.

883
00:57:31,289 --> 00:57:33,592
But how do I tear off 7 people's?

884
00:57:33,592 --> 00:57:34,593
Oh, I'm going crazy.

885
00:57:34,659 --> 00:57:36,661
Who should I make use of now?

886
00:57:40,331 --> 00:57:42,066
I must go and look for Yoo Jae Suk senior!

887
00:57:42,099 --> 00:57:43,534
I can't do this myself.

888
00:57:46,904 --> 00:57:48,105
Sunbaenim!

889
00:57:49,373 --> 00:57:50,741
Jae Suk oppa!

890
00:57:50,874 --> 00:57:51,241
Oh?

891
00:57:52,709 --> 00:57:54,277
-Why. Da Hae? - Oppa!

892
00:57:55,412 --> 00:57:58,815
After walking around until now. I have discovered...

893
00:57:58,915 --> 00:58:00,450
Oppa. you...

894
00:58:00,883 --> 00:58:02,185
Oppa. you are a spy right?

895
00:58:02,618 --> 00:58:03,786
I am a spy.

896
00:58:07,489 --> 00:58:08,557
What did you say?

897
00:58:09,391 --> 00:58:10,492
You are a spy?

898
00:58:10,659 --> 00:58:13,962
The flowers bloom on Dongbaek Island.

899
00:58:14,095 --> 00:58:15,297
You are also a spy?

900
00:58:15,397 --> 00:58:18,166
But, hey, you are too much of a spy!

901
00:58:18,933 --> 00:58:21,135
Everybody thinks it is you!

902
00:58:21,169 --> 00:58:22,403
That's why!

903
00:58:22,436 --> 00:58:24,305
Da Hae, everybody is suspecting you. isn't it?

904
00:58:24,372 --> 00:58:26,006
They are all suspecting you!

905
00:58:26,407 --> 00:58:28,042
-Are you the one who eliminated Gwang Soo? -We must quickly kill them.

906
00:58:28,208 --> 00:58:28,575
Huh?

907
00:58:28,642 --> 00:58:30,177
We must quickly kill them.

908
00:58:30,277 --> 00:58:31,411
Quickly eliminate them?

909
00:58:31,445 --> 00:58:34,114
-Are you the one who eliminated Gwang Soo? -That means we must quickly kill all of them.

910
00:58:34,214 --> 00:58:35,882
What do you mean kill...

911
00:58:36,049 --> 00:58:37,450
-No. Da Hae... -Oppa. aren't you a spy?

912
00:58:37,484 --> 00:58:38,284
Yes. that's right.

913
00:58:38,318 --> 00:58:39,118
That's why!

914
00:58:39,285 --> 00:58:40,553
You are also a spy?

915
00:58:41,154 --> 00:58:42,121
From when?

916
00:58:42,422 --> 00:58:43,990
I am. of course, from the start.

917
00:58:45,191 --> 00:58:46,759
Yes. I knew it would be like that.

918
00:58:46,759 --> 00:58:49,061
I had to find one by one.

919
00:58:49,161 --> 00:58:49,895
Really?

920
00:58:50,896 --> 00:58:52,431
Are you the one who eliminated Gwang Soo?

921
00:58:53,065 --> 00:58:55,700
Oh? It's not you?

922
00:58:59,003 --> 00:59:02,173
You are... too much of a spy!

923
00:59:02,507 --> 00:59:04,575
What, you are not a spy?

924
00:59:06,444 --> 00:59:08,179
Oh, I'm going crazy.

925
00:59:08,212 --> 00:59:10,748
Jae Suk oppa, really, really!

926
00:59:11,482 --> 00:59:12,783
No, Da Hae...

927
00:59:16,219 --> 00:59:20,156
You're a spy! Go further away!

928
00:59:22,859 --> 00:59:24,494
What are you trying to do?

929
00:59:25,895 --> 00:59:28,197
Look at her! This is simply suffocating me!

930
00:59:29,865 --> 00:59:30,633
Shh!

931
00:59:30,733 --> 00:59:31,700
Da Hae!

932
00:59:32,534 --> 00:59:34,303
You can't do this!

933
00:59:36,938 --> 00:59:38,740
Why are you like this?

934
00:59:39,941 --> 00:59:40,608
You now,..

935
00:59:40,642 --> 00:59:42,677
Do you want to see someone get eliminated by acting like this?

936
00:59:43,778 --> 00:59:44,846
What are you doing?

937
00:59:45,546 --> 00:59:46,747
Please go!

938
00:59:48,682 --> 00:59:50,918
What is this?

939
00:59:53,020 --> 00:59:54,187
What is this?

940
00:59:54,488 --> 00:59:56,456
Hyung! Hyung! Hyung!

941
00:59:56,490 --> 00:59:58,158
Someone who is more obvious than me!

942
00:59:58,491 --> 01:00:00,760
This is the first time we see someone who is more obvious than me!

943
01:00:00,860 --> 01:00:02,695
This is the best I've ever seen!

944
01:00:03,496 --> 01:00:04,764
Seriously, I...

945
01:00:04,931 --> 01:00:06,599
I'm seriously going crazy!

946
01:00:06,766 --> 01:00:08,834
I'm going first, Da Hae.

947
01:00:20,078 --> 01:00:21,946
Oppa! You have to believe me

948
01:00:27,285 --> 01:00:30,354
Oppa I'm not kidding around with you.

949
01:00:30,354 --> 01:00:33,157
-Da Hae! Da Hae! -I'm being serious!

950
01:00:33,290 --> 01:00:35,759
-It's not that. -♫Blooming flowers... ♫

951
01:00:36,760 --> 01:00:39,496
-♫Blooming flowers on Dongbaekseom♫ -I'm going crazy! Da Hae!

952
01:00:39,696 --> 01:00:41,264
It's not like that.

953
01:00:41,398 --> 01:00:42,599
Although I am a spy too...

954
01:00:42,765 --> 01:00:44,267
Stop calling me Oppa in front of everyone.

955
01:00:44,334 --> 01:00:45,935
I did it on purpose. It's my plan!

956
01:00:45,968 --> 01:00:46,769
Why?

957
01:00:46,836 --> 01:00:48,371
-It's my plan! -What plan?

958
01:00:48,371 --> 01:00:51,540
If this continues we're both done for! We'll both be out.

959
01:00:51,574 --> 01:00:52,775
I'm so tired right now.

960
01:00:52,808 --> 01:00:55,444
-Da Hae. although I understand what you mean... -We have to survive!

961
01:00:55,577 --> 01:00:58,113
They'll want to kill us now.

962
01:00:58,113 --> 01:01:00,348
This is because of you.

963
01:01:00,749 --> 01:01:02,951
Because I'm with you. I'm being. suspected as a spy now!

964
01:01:03,251 --> 01:01:06,521
Da Hae. that's why. You made the wrong move.

965
01:01:06,521 --> 01:01:07,855
Be quiet!

966
01:01:09,390 --> 01:01:10,358
Wow, really.

967
01:01:11,192 --> 01:01:13,460
She wants me to be quiet,

968
01:01:14,661 --> 01:01:18,565
I can't do this, now I have to be quiet.

969
01:01:19,366 --> 01:01:21,835
Are you shushing me because you're scared of being discovered?

970
01:01:21,968 --> 01:01:23,903
I'm going crazy.

971
01:01:24,037 --> 01:01:26,739
I'll really go crazy soon!

972
01:01:26,906 --> 01:01:27,940
-Da Hae... -Oppa, Oppa.

973
01:01:28,007 --> 01:01:30,076
Oppa is a man.

974
01:01:30,309 --> 01:01:32,278
I don't think I can do this myself.

975
01:01:32,378 --> 01:01:33,679
Hold on Da Hae.

976
01:01:33,746 --> 01:01:37,549
Oppa .we have to kill Jong Kook Oppa and everyone else!

977
01:01:39,618 --> 01:01:41,019
Us sitting around like this...

978
01:01:41,419 --> 01:01:42,320
Let's go!

979
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:44,355
Rather than waiting here...

980
01:01:44,489 --> 01:01:45,557
Hey Da Hae!

981
01:01:45,657 --> 01:01:47,759
-Why don't you just eliminate me! -Shhh!

982
01:01:47,759 --> 01:01:49,560
That's not it.

983
01:01:50,361 --> 01:01:52,696
Da Hae. stop following me.

984
01:01:52,763 --> 01:01:54,265
Just eliminate me now!

985
01:01:54,431 --> 01:01:55,232
Keep quiet!

986
01:02:00,871 --> 01:02:01,671
Go quickly.

987
01:02:05,141 --> 01:02:05,875
For now...

988
01:02:06,209 --> 01:02:07,810
-Right now... -Da Hae.

989
01:02:07,910 --> 01:02:09,946
If you see me pretend you don't know me.

990
01:02:10,146 --> 01:02:11,314
But we're spies!

991
01:02:13,415 --> 01:02:14,083
Da Hae...

992
01:02:14,116 --> 01:02:16,852
So we have to go kill the others quickly!

993
01:02:19,121 --> 01:02:20,322
It's not that, its not like that!

994
01:02:20,389 --> 01:02:21,990
That won't work!

995
01:02:22,257 --> 01:02:24,392
This will make both of us look suspicious.

996
01:02:24,459 --> 01:02:25,693
We have to kill them quickly.

997
01:02:25,860 --> 01:02:26,661
No no!

998
01:02:27,462 --> 01:02:29,297
Why don't you listen to what other people say?

999
01:02:29,330 --> 01:02:30,765
We have to get rid of the...

1000
01:02:30,865 --> 01:02:32,600
No Da Hae, not like this.

1001
01:02:32,700 --> 01:02:34,168
Please explain to him!

1002
01:02:35,769 --> 01:02:38,071
Why is it so hard for us to communicate?

1003
01:02:41,508 --> 01:02:43,843
I'm so frustrated! I feel sick.

1004
01:02:44,644 --> 01:02:46,346
Do you have any sedatives?

1005
01:02:46,446 --> 01:02:47,614
My heart is pounding,

1006
01:02:47,647 --> 01:02:52,518
Oppa and I, since the first moments... here, from here on something seems to have gone wrong.

1007
01:02:52,585 --> 01:02:54,253
Da Hae it's not like that,

1008
01:02:54,353 --> 01:02:56,355
-There's nothing wron... -Listen to me!

1009
01:02:56,555 --> 01:02:58,557
I've been listening to you this whole time!

1010
01:02:58,557 --> 01:03:00,092
I have to listen to yo again?

1011
01:03:00,459 --> 01:03:01,660
From now on.

1012
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:05,997
Right? From there... we'll do that. But. the most important thing for us...

1013
01:03:06,231 --> 01:03:07,699
You're too funny!

1014
01:03:09,033 --> 01:03:10,835
You're too good at this!

1015
01:03:11,269 --> 01:03:13,804
The only way to describe you is very-Daebak!

1016
01:03:14,839 --> 01:03:16,073
Very Daebak!

1017
01:03:16,173 --> 01:03:17,841
The only way to describe you is very-Daebak!

1018
01:03:18,242 --> 01:03:20,210
Okay, let's go find Jong Kook Oppa!

1019
01:03:20,277 --> 01:03:21,345
What?

1020
01:03:23,180 --> 01:03:24,948
If we don't do that we'll die.

1021
01:03:24,981 --> 01:03:26,383
Do you want to die?

1022
01:03:30,420 --> 01:03:31,687
Da Hae. to be honest.

1023
01:03:31,788 --> 01:03:34,690
Before I met you. I wasn't suspected at all.

1024
01:03:34,690 --> 01:03:37,559
After I met you. things became like this.

1025
01:03:37,660 --> 01:03:39,995
-Okay, let's go for now. -Go for now.

1026
01:03:40,262 --> 01:03:41,630
Eliminate them,

1027
01:03:41,763 --> 01:03:43,899
Oppa. Fighting!

1028
01:03:43,999 --> 01:03:45,700
Don't do that!

1029
01:03:45,700 --> 01:03:47,702
-Don't do that. -Oppa, Spies.

1030
01:03:48,336 --> 01:03:49,837
Don't do that!

1031
01:03:50,438 --> 01:03:52,140
What are you doing now!

1032
01:03:53,074 --> 01:03:54,408
We are on the same team.

1033
01:03:56,043 --> 01:03:57,444
Oh, so frustrating.

1034
01:04:01,415 --> 01:04:04,417
I got both of them on my side, right?

1035
01:04:08,822 --> 01:04:11,991
Seriously, this is called very-Daebak.

1036
01:04:13,693 --> 01:04:15,561
Da Hae's the best, just the best,

1037
01:04:19,631 --> 01:04:20,966
Gary, want to come with me?

1038
01:04:21,834 --> 01:04:23,335
It's tiring.

1039
01:04:24,803 --> 01:04:27,505
Let's just go look for clothes for my wife.

1040
01:04:28,440 --> 01:04:31,743
Me? How would I know what hyung's wife likes?

1041
01:04:31,876 --> 01:04:36,881
Just think about what your girlfriend would like.

1042
01:04:39,984 --> 01:04:41,085
How does this look?

1043
01:04:43,854 --> 01:04:46,389
-Just pick some. -Why am I picking?

1044
01:04:47,857 --> 01:04:49,359
-This type looks fine. -What?

1045
01:04:49,459 --> 01:04:50,960
-You scared me. -You surprised me!

1046
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:52,662
Why are you here?

1047
01:04:52,762 --> 01:04:56,399
Really. Please, we're shopping right now.

1048
01:04:56,932 --> 01:04:58,067
Da Hae come here,

1049
01:04:58,100 --> 01:05:00,002
-You don't need to be like that. -What?

1050
01:05:00,069 --> 01:05:01,570
-Hold on. -There's only us here.

1051
01:05:01,637 --> 01:05:02,471
What?

1052
01:05:02,938 --> 01:05:04,273
Hold on. Why?

1053
01:05:17,351 --> 01:05:18,953
Oppa! Oppa!

1054
01:05:19,820 --> 01:05:20,654
Oppa!

1055
01:05:35,334 --> 01:05:36,869
Oh. what?

1056
01:05:41,707 --> 01:05:42,641
Wait a minute.

1057
01:05:44,209 --> 01:05:45,444
Hey. Da Hae,

1058
01:05:47,813 --> 01:05:50,682
-I'm sorry. -Dae Hae.

1059
01:05:51,316 --> 01:05:52,383
What's going on?

1060
01:05:52,450 --> 01:05:54,085
Hey! I'm the spy!

1061
01:06:02,293 --> 01:06:04,161
Gary is a spy too?

1062
01:06:21,911 --> 01:06:24,813
Goodbye.

1063
01:06:27,082 --> 01:06:28,784
Gary, out.!

1064
01:06:28,984 --> 01:06:29,885
What?

1065
01:06:30,752 --> 01:06:32,420
Ji Suk Jin. out!

1066
01:06:36,591 --> 01:06:38,559
The person who controls space!

1067
01:06:38,659 --> 01:06:40,661
Why is Kang Gary out?

1068
01:06:41,262 --> 01:06:45,165
Hey. Jong Kook was with you right?

1069
01:06:46,033 --> 01:06:48,035
Did you use your superpower again?

1070
01:06:48,201 --> 01:06:49,035
What superpower?

1071
01:06:49,069 --> 01:06:50,937
The person who controls space!

1072
01:06:51,004 --> 01:06:53,540
-Did you use your superpower again? -The person who controls time.

1073
01:06:53,740 --> 01:06:54,908
Hey!

1074
01:06:55,008 --> 01:06:56,309
Are you really going to be like this?

1075
01:06:56,943 --> 01:07:01,113
Because you do this. I'm going to be suspected.

1076
01:07:02,281 --> 01:07:03,749
I've been suspected!

1077
01:07:03,782 --> 01:07:04,717
I know you're not. hyung.

1078
01:07:04,717 --> 01:07:07,152
-Eh? How do you know? -You know I'm not either right?

1079
01:07:07,286 --> 01:07:08,587
I don't think it's you.

1080
01:07:08,787 --> 01:07:10,789
Looks like Gary being out had nothing to do with you.

1081
01:07:10,956 --> 01:07:12,357
I suspected that it was you at first.

1082
01:07:12,390 --> 01:07:14,859
And I suspected you. I thought it was you for sure!

1083
01:07:15,059 --> 01:07:15,960
Why?

1084
01:07:16,160 --> 01:07:17,662
Because you're talking with Da Hae.

1085
01:07:17,662 --> 01:07:19,330
Hold on! Who's that?

1086
01:07:19,430 --> 01:07:21,766
-What is it? -Gary hyung is escorted.

1087
01:07:26,270 --> 01:07:28,405
-Hey Gary! -Hyung, are you okay?

1088
01:08:02,837 --> 01:08:05,172
Hyung! What are you doing?

1089
01:08:06,306 --> 01:08:08,942
What are you doing? Come here first.

1090
01:08:09,009 --> 01:08:10,077
Come here first.

1091
01:08:10,677 --> 01:08:11,578
Please take care of him.

1092
01:08:11,645 --> 01:08:13,146
Come here first, hyung!

1093
01:08:14,047 --> 01:08:14,981
What's going on?

1094
01:08:16,683 --> 01:08:17,884
Sorry about that, Dong Hoon!

1095
01:08:17,951 --> 01:08:19,118
What is this?

1096
01:08:19,185 --> 01:08:20,887
What were you doing, hyung?

1097
01:08:20,920 --> 01:08:22,655
I thought you were a spy.

1098
01:08:23,556 --> 01:08:24,690
Come over here.

1099
01:08:25,691 --> 01:08:26,759
Come over here.

1100
01:08:26,759 --> 01:08:28,193
I'm speechless.

1101
01:08:29,995 --> 01:08:32,931
Ha Ha. just go to the jail. I'll tell you later.

1102
01:08:37,235 --> 01:08:40,104
He didn't see this, did he? That hyung.

1103
01:08:42,873 --> 01:08:44,842
What are we going to do? What should we do?

1104
01:08:52,849 --> 01:08:55,552
I've been running around like this by myself.

1105
01:08:55,985 --> 01:09:00,490
Why isn't Yoo Jae Suk sunbaenim helping me?

1106
01:09:00,757 --> 01:09:02,858
Why! Why!

1107
01:09:03,492 --> 01:09:06,962
Since he's on the same side as me.

1108
01:09:10,899 --> 01:09:14,369
HaHa. out! HaHa. out!

1109
01:09:14,503 --> 01:09:16,037
HaHa's out?

1110
01:09:16,171 --> 01:09:17,205
He's out?

1111
01:09:18,806 --> 01:09:20,174
Yoo Jae Suk sunbaenim!

1112
01:09:27,214 --> 01:09:29,283
He's giving me help though.

1113
01:09:30,517 --> 01:09:31,885
This is great!

1114
01:09:32,819 --> 01:09:35,789
Then. I'm more comfortable. This is good.

1115
01:09:37,424 --> 01:09:40,260
Good job! Yoo Jae Suk sunbaenim. you did well!

1116
01:09:40,693 --> 01:09:43,329
I'll tear yours off later!

1117
01:09:49,601 --> 01:09:51,970
Hyung! You've been too busy!

1118
01:09:52,070 --> 01:09:52,671
Why?

1119
01:09:52,704 --> 01:09:54,506
You've been acting like you're busy.

1120
01:09:54,539 --> 01:09:55,574
-Me? -Yeah.

1121
01:09:55,807 --> 01:09:58,043
I'm just wandering around right now.

1122
01:09:58,476 --> 01:10:00,245
Should I just sit back?

1123
01:10:00,578 --> 01:10:03,114
Hyung walk slowly. You might run out of energy.

1124
01:10:04,448 --> 01:10:07,918
Hyung is the most suspicious now. So you can't die just yet-

1125
01:10:08,252 --> 01:10:13,490
The longer he's suspected, the more it helps me.

1126
01:10:15,258 --> 01:10:17,694
I need to eliminate Jong Kook quickly. Better hurry now,..

1127
01:10:19,963 --> 01:10:21,564
We came here before.

1128
01:10:29,872 --> 01:10:31,073
Is that her?

1129
01:10:33,675 --> 01:10:37,345
Find the staff that's wearing a red scarf! Rendezvous signal is "Password Controller"

1130
01:10:52,259 --> 01:10:52,960
Hello.

1131
01:10:56,797 --> 01:10:59,532
The one who control the password!

1132
01:11:12,778 --> 01:11:14,613
Anything else?

1133
01:11:28,693 --> 01:11:31,495
Searching gain?!

1134
01:11:32,996 --> 01:11:35,732
It took me 2 hours just to find this person-

1135
01:11:40,770 --> 01:11:42,038
What is this!

1136
01:11:42,272 --> 01:11:44,440
Do you want me to kick your butt?

1137
01:11:47,777 --> 01:11:48,844
Really.

1138
01:11:48,978 --> 01:11:51,280
Where is he? Where is this person?

1139
01:11:51,413 --> 01:11:53,716
You don't know? Can you tell me?

1140
01:11:58,954 --> 01:12:00,555
It looks like a battery.

1141
01:12:13,567 --> 01:12:20,040
Usually.., when the battery is inserted... Shouldn't this work when I press it?

1142
01:12:20,106 --> 01:12:22,575
But if the battery is empty...

1143
01:12:34,219 --> 01:12:36,155
Da Hae!

1144
01:12:42,193 --> 01:12:42,994
Da Hae.

1145
01:12:43,194 --> 01:12:43,862
Oppa.

1146
01:12:44,295 --> 01:12:46,864
How is the mission going?

1147
01:12:47,231 --> 01:12:49,634
Da Hae come over here, You'll get spotted if you stand there.

1148
01:12:50,601 --> 01:12:53,771
Da Hae what are you standing"there for?

1149
01:12:54,538 --> 01:12:56,039
I'll be discovered here.

1150
01:12:56,173 --> 01:12:58,175
Forget it.

1151
01:12:58,275 --> 01:13:00,844
The each of us must eliminate someone now.

1152
01:13:01,444 --> 01:13:03,480
Because they have great suspicion on you.

1153
01:13:03,980 --> 01:13:06,149
I also said I was suspicious of you.

1154
01:13:07,550 --> 01:13:08,885
I have no choice.

1155
01:13:08,951 --> 01:13:11,287
This is teamwork Da Hae.

1156
01:13:11,487 --> 01:13:15,457
But. didn't say I suspected oppa or anything like that,

1157
01:13:15,491 --> 01:13:18,160
That's why l'm being suspected.

1158
01:13:18,460 --> 01:13:20,662
Because you didn't say that you suspected me.

1159
01:13:20,695 --> 01:13:21,830
But we are together.

1160
01:13:21,897 --> 01:13:24,733
Yes we are together.

1161
01:13:24,799 --> 01:13:25,867
I don't want to!

1162
01:13:26,167 --> 01:13:26,935
No.

1163
01:13:30,171 --> 01:13:33,441
We are together why must we be like this? Why must we slander each other?

1164
01:13:36,210 --> 01:13:38,979
Da Hae. haven't you watched Running Man before?

1165
01:13:39,146 --> 01:13:43,250
We are together so we must help each other.

1166
01:13:43,250 --> 01:13:44,617
No. that's not it.

1167
01:13:44,617 --> 01:13:46,219
Who should we kill?

1168
01:13:48,488 --> 01:13:51,490
- We must hurry. - Jong Kook is on 2nd floor.

1169
01:13:52,591 --> 01:13:55,861
It doesn't benefit us if we delay the time.

1170
01:13:55,861 --> 01:13:59,898
-Let's go to the 2nd floor first. -Catch him from the front then tear his name tag from the back.

1171
01:13:59,932 --> 01:14:01,566
Jong Kook cannot be caught.

1172
01:14:01,633 --> 01:14:05,637
I'll go look for Jong Kook first. Understand?

1173
01:14:14,512 --> 01:14:17,314
Jae Suk oppa is getting the table ready,

1174
01:14:17,848 --> 01:14:19,783
I just have to put the spoon down.

1175
01:14:20,050 --> 01:14:22,486
And just have to eat now.

1176
01:14:31,861 --> 01:14:33,462
Where did everybody go?

1177
01:14:36,932 --> 01:14:39,501
Hyung! Who's that?

1178
01:14:41,370 --> 01:14:42,504
Is that hyung?

1179
01:14:44,372 --> 01:14:47,342
Jae Suk hyung! Da Hae's at 1st floor!

1180
01:14:48,042 --> 01:14:49,777
Da Hae's at 1st floor!

1181
01:14:50,745 --> 01:14:52,813
Oppa. now is not the time.

1182
01:14:54,315 --> 01:14:55,082
Why...?

1183
01:14:56,584 --> 01:14:57,685
Why not?

1184
01:14:57,718 --> 01:14:59,119
Oppa. now is not the time.

1185
01:14:59,119 --> 01:15:01,788
-Me? Why? -Hey! Da Hae!

1186
01:15:07,494 --> 01:15:08,795
Where were you?

1187
01:15:08,962 --> 01:15:13,499
Oppa. the mission. Spy? I'm the spy!

1188
01:15:16,936 --> 01:15:17,937
What did you say?

1189
01:15:18,470 --> 01:15:19,938
Where were you?

1190
01:15:20,706 --> 01:15:22,140
I'm here.

1191
01:15:22,274 --> 01:15:25,043
But every time you're not around, one person will just be out.

1192
01:15:27,412 --> 01:15:30,982
Why are you being like this to me? I'm also very uneasy now.

1193
01:15:31,082 --> 01:15:32,216
Why are you avoiding me?

1194
01:15:32,216 --> 01:15:33,451
Where is Ji Hyo?

1195
01:15:34,051 --> 01:15:35,886
-Jong Kook where is Ji Hyo? -I don't know.

1196
01:15:37,254 --> 01:15:40,991
Oppa! I'm also a spy. I'm a spy.

1197
01:15:44,661 --> 01:15:45,996
Where is Ji Hyo?

1198
01:15:49,165 --> 01:15:50,066
Why oppa?

1199
01:15:50,266 --> 01:15:51,934
How can I tear it?

1200
01:16:02,778 --> 01:16:03,979
Jae Suk oppa.

1201
01:16:45,250 --> 01:16:46,318
Jong Kook calm down.

1202
01:16:49,621 --> 01:16:52,190
My heart is beating so fast now!

1203
01:16:52,457 --> 01:16:53,691
Good job!

1204
01:16:53,992 --> 01:16:55,660
That's how it should be done!

1205
01:16:59,330 --> 01:17:00,965
What about Ji Hyo unni?

1206
01:17:02,032 --> 01:17:06,269
Wait. Jong Kook is no more and there's only Ji Hyo left.

1207
01:17:06,370 --> 01:17:08,238
There's no need to hide anymore!

1208
01:17:22,951 --> 01:17:26,755
Oppa you go first. I'll catch on later.

1209
01:17:26,788 --> 01:17:30,191
In the worst scenario I'M tear your name tag in front of Ji Hyo.

1210
01:17:30,458 --> 01:17:31,493
What?

1211
01:17:31,559 --> 01:17:33,161
Team victory is all that matters!

1212
01:17:33,361 --> 01:17:34,996
The worst scenario is I'll tear your name tag.

1213
01:17:35,063 --> 01:17:37,331
Then just eliminate Ji Hyo will do!

1214
01:17:37,732 --> 01:17:40,067
No this won't do!

1215
01:17:41,302 --> 01:17:42,036
Oppa.

1216
01:17:43,470 --> 01:17:44,805
Hey! Hey! JI Hyo! Ji Hyo!

1217
01:17:45,239 --> 01:17:48,075
Ji Hyo it's Da Hae! It's Da Hae!

1218
01:17:48,141 --> 01:17:50,043
How did Jong Kook oppa get eliminated?

1219
01:17:50,110 --> 01:17:51,311
-I don't know. I don't know. - Hello.

1220
01:17:51,311 --> 01:17:53,980
Hello. It been a long time.

1221
01:17:54,080 --> 01:17:55,548
How was he eliminated?

1222
01:17:55,548 --> 01:17:57,683
It's Da Hae!

1223
01:18:01,554 --> 01:18:04,890
In the worst scenario, I'll tear your name tag in front of Ji Hyo.

1224
01:18:05,190 --> 01:18:05,858
What?

1225
01:18:06,191 --> 01:18:07,960
Team victory is all that matters!

1226
01:18:08,060 --> 01:18:09,594
The worst scenario is I'll tear your name tag.

1227
01:18:09,694 --> 01:18:11,896
Then just eliminate Ji Hyo will do!

1228
01:18:17,168 --> 01:18:22,640
-There's a criminal among us, a spy? -Of course there is! Of course!

1229
01:18:25,042 --> 01:18:28,078
Oppa. you're the spy right?

1230
01:18:31,481 --> 01:18:33,216
-Ji Hyo. -I saw it.

1231
01:18:33,550 --> 01:18:34,217
What?

1232
01:18:34,350 --> 01:18:37,220
Oppa tore it.

1233
01:18:38,888 --> 01:18:39,989
Yes I tore Gwang Soo's name tag!

1234
01:18:40,256 --> 01:18:41,490
Jong Kook oppa's too!

1235
01:18:42,058 --> 01:18:43,759
You said I tore Jong Kook's name tag?

1236
01:18:43,959 --> 01:18:47,095
Then I did it? I tore it off?

1237
01:18:48,263 --> 01:18:51,199
Really this acting! Who am I supposed to trust?

1238
01:18:51,433 --> 01:18:53,401
This is so confusing.

1239
01:18:53,768 --> 01:18:56,971
Da Hae you're the spy right?!

1240
01:18:59,507 --> 01:19:00,274
What?

1241
01:19:01,242 --> 01:19:02,643
You're the spy right?

1242
01:19:02,943 --> 01:19:07,147
Really, ,. Your reaction is too 1 dimensional!

1243
01:19:09,783 --> 01:19:13,119
Did you get anything? Did you receive any mission?

1244
01:19:13,119 --> 01:19:14,254
I didn't receive anything...

1245
01:19:14,254 --> 01:19:16,089
So you're just strolling around?

1246
01:19:16,990 --> 01:19:18,291
Just strolling around.

1247
01:19:18,358 --> 01:19:19,592
Then you didn't stroll?

1248
01:19:19,692 --> 01:19:21,193
Our aim is to catch the spies right?

1249
01:19:21,294 --> 01:19:21,961
Yes.

1250
01:19:22,161 --> 01:19:25,631
He's the Spy!

1251
01:19:29,134 --> 01:19:30,569
You know he's pretending.

1252
01:19:30,869 --> 01:19:31,303
Unni.

1253
01:19:31,470 --> 01:19:34,039
Trust me this time! Really!

1254
01:19:34,439 --> 01:19:38,443
I'll give up the number 1 spot to you! Really!

1255
01:19:40,278 --> 01:19:42,313
So if you tear it down. I'll give you the first spot!

1256
01:19:42,480 --> 01:19:43,647
Then quickly tear it!

1257
01:20:01,063 --> 01:20:02,732
Fantastic!

1258
01:20:02,965 --> 01:20:05,134
Fantastic!

1259
01:20:07,336 --> 01:20:09,138
I almost fell into your trap

1260
01:20:09,171 --> 01:20:11,373
I almost walked past you.

1261
01:20:11,373 --> 01:20:14,109
Oppa. you're really too much.

1262
01:20:15,910 --> 01:20:18,980
So this is the end?

1263
01:20:19,080 --> 01:20:20,815
So simply like this?

1264
01:20:21,115 --> 01:20:23,150
How did you know, Da Hae?

1265
01:20:23,150 --> 01:20:25,986
-Oppa.♫-You really are a Fantastic kid.

1266
01:20:26,020 --> 01:20:29,089
Why do you always make me so confused

1267
01:20:30,090 --> 01:20:32,392
AH! Really!

1268
01:20:33,393 --> 01:20:34,928
Fantastic!

1269
01:20:41,434 --> 01:20:43,369
Yoo Jae Suk. Out!

1270
01:20:43,469 --> 01:20:45,404
- Yoo Jae Suk. Out! -What?

1271
01:20:45,438 --> 01:20:48,574
-What? He's out? -Hyung. who eliminated you?

1272
01:20:48,741 --> 01:20:50,375
-Lee Da Hae! -What?!

1273
01:20:50,375 --> 01:20:53,378
-Hyung, aren't you a spy? -I also got eliminated by Lee Da Hae.

1274
01:20:53,378 --> 01:20:57,115
-Hyung are you a spy? You aren't a spy right? -You're a spy?

1275
01:20:57,115 --> 01:20:58,516
Wow, I'm surprised.

1276
01:20:58,516 --> 01:21:00,184
So hyung and Lee Da Hae are both spies?

1277
01:21:00,184 --> 01:21:01,219
Yeah!

1278
01:21:01,219 --> 01:21:02,920
I only found when I came here.

1279
01:21:02,920 --> 01:21:08,626
-When I first came here they made me a spy. -Wow, he's a spy.

1280
01:21:08,626 --> 01:21:11,628
-It was like this since we came. -What I want to say is.

1281
01:21:11,628 --> 01:21:13,730
I told Haha earlier,

1282
01:21:13,730 --> 01:21:16,466
the atmosphere was weird

1283
01:21:16,466 --> 01:21:21,137
Under no circumstances, whenever there's a spy. I'm always being suspected,

1284
01:21:21,137 --> 01:21:22,972
I wondered what happened to hyung

1285
01:21:23,139 --> 01:21:25,341
What's that?

1286
01:21:25,341 --> 01:21:27,009
It's a mission.

1287
01:21:27,843 --> 01:21:29,645
What's that? What's the mission?

1288
01:21:29,845 --> 01:21:32,147
Rendezvous password is "Kick the butt".

1289
01:21:33,882 --> 01:21:35,750
That's why there were staffs.

1290
01:21:35,750 --> 01:21:38,320
Is that the last one?

1291
01:21:38,320 --> 01:21:42,090
-It's the last one. -Hyung, as the spy, shouldn't you be surviving till the end?

1292
01:21:42,090 --> 01:21:45,293
-Why are you eliminated -The result is out, please go to the 9fh floor.

1293
01:21:45,293 --> 01:21:46,761
Huh? It has ended?

1294
01:21:46,761 --> 01:21:48,863
-Has it really ended? -It can't possibly be that Blank Ji won?

1295
01:21:48,863 --> 01:21:50,864
Can everyone please make your way to the 9tfi floor.

1296
01:21:50,864 --> 01:21:53,834
Wait a moment, we just go to 9th floor?

1297
01:21:53,834 --> 01:21:55,268
Before we go. do you want to sing a song first?

1298
01:21:55,268 --> 01:21:57,070
No way, what about singing songs

1299
01:21:57,070 --> 01:21:58,972
1, 2, 3 . 4

1300
01:21:58,972 --> 01:22:05,878
Blooming flowers on Dongbaekseom

1301
01:22:05,878 --> 01:22:11,950
Together with the mates from the village

1302
01:22:11,950 --> 01:22:15,320
Playing together happily

1303
01:22:15,320 --> 01:22:18,723
Love you!!

1304
01:22:19,424 --> 01:22:22,660
We got scammed by the ladies!

1305
01:22:22,660 --> 01:22:26,297
We all got cheated! Hyung, we all got cheated!

1306
01:22:27,098 --> 01:22:30,534
-We were cheated! -You thought you were a spy alone?

1307
01:22:31,168 --> 01:22:33,370
-We're all spies!! -We all are!!

1308
01:22:33,537 --> 01:22:35,505
-What? -We're all spies!

1309
01:22:35,706 --> 01:22:39,142
-We've all been used! -We are?

1310
01:22:40,377 --> 01:22:41,277
What are you saying?

1311
01:22:41,277 --> 01:22:47,850
Together with the mates from the village

1312
01:22:47,850 --> 01:22:50,886
When she's doing this to hyung...

1313
01:22:50,886 --> 01:22:53,122
Da Hae was also doing this with me.

1314
01:22:53,122 --> 01:22:54,490
Ya! This is really...

1315
01:22:54,490 --> 01:22:56,491
So you guys knew it from the start!

1316
01:22:56,491 --> 01:22:59,494
It's Lee Da Hae.

1317
01:23:24,918 --> 01:23:28,254
Oppa! Faster come over here and chat with us!

1318
01:23:28,254 --> 01:23:31,390
Let's talk! Come here and talk! Faster!

1319
01:23:35,627 --> 01:23:36,962
Ji Hyo are you eliminated?

1320
01:23:38,030 --> 01:23:39,297
Ji Hyo are you eliminated?

1321
01:23:50,041 --> 01:23:51,409
Daebak!

1322
01:24:06,322 --> 01:24:09,525
That's why I was killed.

1323
01:24:10,493 --> 01:24:13,662
Wow, really.

1324
01:24:15,197 --> 01:24:18,834
-Hey, Lee Dae Hae! -Hey! Lee Dae Hae!

1325
01:24:18,834 --> 01:24:22,103
-Eat well and live well! -But, how did you know about the song?

1326
01:24:22,103 --> 01:24:22,537
Eh?

1327
01:24:22,537 --> 01:24:24,839
-Right. -Just what I was saying..

1328
01:24:24,839 --> 01:24:28,042
-She overheard Jae Suk sang the song earlier. -Oh really?

1329
01:24:28,142 --> 01:24:29,977
Ah! Jae Suk!

1330
01:24:29,977 --> 01:24:31,946
Jae Suk hyung was the one that caused everything today!

1331
01:24:32,046 --> 01:24:33,547
I'm... really everybody...

1332
01:24:33,547 --> 01:24:36,216
The lesson learnt today is: Woman must be chosen very carefully.

1333
01:24:36,216 --> 01:24:39,386
It was all because of her acting! It's ail acting!

1334
01:24:39,386 --> 01:24:43,390
-Everyone here today totally got cheated by Da Hae! -I didn't even do one mission!

1335
01:24:45,725 --> 01:24:50,830
But whatever the case, Lee Da Hae. victorious! Congratulations!

1336
01:24:55,501 --> 01:24:57,169
Lee Da Hae had made a call

1337
01:25:00,238 --> 01:25:02,407
In the Busan Special, there is a bundle

1338
01:25:04,142 --> 01:25:06,377
-We've reached! -They all came

1339
01:25:07,645 --> 01:25:08,880
Where is it?

1340
01:25:08,880 --> 01:25:10,348
I found it!

1341
01:25:10,348 --> 01:25:12,717
Ahh! Don't come over! Don't come over!
