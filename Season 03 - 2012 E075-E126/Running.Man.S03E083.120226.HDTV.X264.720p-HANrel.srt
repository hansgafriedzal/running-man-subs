1
00:00:05,956 --> 00:00:07,891
Now you are treating me as a spy?

2
00:00:07,924 --> 00:00:08,792
You are now a spy.

3
00:00:08,892 --> 00:00:11,728
There is not only one spy.

4
00:00:12,128 --> 00:00:13,696
Suddenly I am atone.

5
00:00:13,763 --> 00:00:14,998
I will tear it all off.

6
00:00:15,031 --> 00:00:16,699
-He is a spy!-You are a spy right?

7
00:00:17,667 --> 00:00:18,935
Oppa did well!

8
00:00:19,001 --> 00:00:20,703
She's history's strongest!

9
00:00:22,138 --> 00:00:24,206
Lee Da Hae called me.

10
00:00:28,443 --> 00:00:29,945
We arrived!

11
00:00:29,978 --> 00:00:31,046
Where is it?

12
00:00:31,146 --> 00:00:32,180
I found it!

13
00:00:32,213 --> 00:00:33,615
-Hey guys! -Don't come closer!

14
00:00:33,715 --> 00:00:35,617
Da Hae! Da Hae!

15
00:01:05,644 --> 00:01:06,979
Hello.

16
00:01:21,425 --> 00:01:22,827
Long time no see.

17
00:01:26,096 --> 00:01:28,565
But I think it's tiring when I come here..,

18
00:01:30,067 --> 00:01:32,702
It was very tiring escaping alone last time, right?

19
00:01:32,803 --> 00:01:36,005
That time it was a little... yes, it was very tiring.

20
00:01:39,175 --> 00:01:41,777
I am a little afraid. I won't be alone again right?

21
00:01:43,746 --> 00:01:50,219
Choosing teammates. Choose 2 members you want to team up with today find head to their rooms to wake them up personally.

22
00:01:50,385 --> 00:01:51,219
Two people.

23
00:01:51,219 --> 00:01:53,488
-This me it is together? -Yes, together.

24
00:01:54,389 --> 00:01:58,293
A few days ago Lee Da Hae gave me a call.

25
00:01:59,294 --> 00:02:01,963
She said she was nervous and would like me to go on with her.

26
00:02:02,096 --> 00:02:04,865
It is actually because of this that I came,

27
00:02:05,666 --> 00:02:08,569
She said she wanted to do this together. If I choose someone else I will get a scolding.

28
00:02:10,938 --> 00:02:13,273
On a personal scale I would like to choose Gwang Soo.

29
00:02:14,474 --> 00:02:18,344
The members and Lee Da Hae's room numbers.

30
00:02:22,882 --> 00:02:24,984
Should I choose Da Hae or not?

31
00:02:25,718 --> 00:02:26,685
Let's go!

32
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:37,429
I will go to the 17th floor first.

33
00:02:53,844 --> 00:02:55,545
They are sleeping very deeply.

34
00:02:58,548 --> 00:03:00,984
Wow, how could he be sleeping all the way over here.

35
00:03:05,354 --> 00:03:06,489
He'll be asleep, right?

36
00:03:26,741 --> 00:03:28,642
What is going on?

37
00:03:28,876 --> 00:03:32,045
What are you doing now? It is morning already.

38
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:33,547
Why are you here?

39
00:03:36,149 --> 00:03:38,318
I didn't expect you would be sleeping like this...

40
00:03:44,991 --> 00:03:46,826
Let me sleep for another 5 minutes...

41
00:03:47,093 --> 00:03:48,260
You can't.

42
00:03:49,028 --> 00:03:50,829
What should I do about your hair?

43
00:03:52,197 --> 00:03:53,599
Regardless, we are a team today.

44
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:55,667
Hurry go change your clothes.

45
00:03:56,368 --> 00:03:57,369
We are a team,

46
00:03:57,435 --> 00:03:59,270
-Really? -Yes, we are a team. Hurry up.

47
00:04:00,371 --> 00:04:02,473
Did I choose wrongly?

48
00:04:07,078 --> 00:04:08,345
Where are we going?

49
00:04:08,379 --> 00:04:10,447
To find our next team member.

50
00:04:18,722 --> 00:04:20,557
I came because someone asked me to.

51
00:04:20,557 --> 00:04:21,658
-Is that so? -Yes.

52
00:04:21,724 --> 00:04:23,059
Da Hae. Da Hae.

53
00:04:23,526 --> 00:04:26,796
Da Hae? Really? Daebak.

54
00:04:34,236 --> 00:04:38,340
-Maybe drinking coffee. -Oh my. gave me a shock.

55
00:04:38,373 --> 00:04:39,474
Who is that?

56
00:04:41,543 --> 00:04:42,944
Da Hae!

57
00:04:43,044 --> 00:04:44,445
Oppa!

58
00:04:48,783 --> 00:04:51,719
Oppa, I suffered so much yesterday.

59
00:04:52,353 --> 00:04:54,121
That is why I have come.

60
00:04:54,321 --> 00:04:55,255
That is good.

61
00:04:55,289 --> 00:04:58,692
So... be part of our team.

62
00:04:58,725 --> 00:05:00,160
-I've brought HaHa with me. -We are a team?

63
00:05:00,193 --> 00:05:01,194
Yes.

64
00:05:02,095 --> 00:05:04,530
You know that we have escaped together for a year right?

65
00:05:07,133 --> 00:05:08,167
Ah, that's right!

66
00:05:10,202 --> 00:05:11,537
He is an expert in escaping.

67
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:12,871
That's right.

68
00:05:13,138 --> 00:05:15,774
I kept thinking this team feels familiar.

69
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:26,050
Since yon have formed your team, we will start the competition.

70
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:28,786
Is this really? I still cannot believe.

71
00:05:31,522 --> 00:05:32,656
Bundle race.

72
00:05:34,658 --> 00:05:36,827
Search for the one and only real bundle.

73
00:05:37,127 --> 00:05:40,730
The team who holds on to the real bundle till the end wins.

74
00:05:41,598 --> 00:05:43,700
The first mission's location is...

75
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,101
- Jagalchi Market. -Jagalchi Market?

76
00:05:46,736 --> 00:05:48,804
Tins is the bundle that came with you.

77
00:05:54,243 --> 00:05:55,077
Sports bag,

78
00:05:55,144 --> 00:05:56,345
A big teddy bear.

79
00:05:56,345 --> 00:05:57,546
Shoes and...

80
00:05:57,579 --> 00:05:58,680
The biggest TV in the store.

81
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,781
A Korean beef set

82
00:05:59,881 --> 00:06:02,284
I want a coloured T shirt.

83
00:06:02,384 --> 00:06:03,184
Tablet PC.

84
00:06:03,184 --> 00:06:04,819
Desktop computer.

85
00:06:04,819 --> 00:06:07,021
Just give me 1 million wons worth of spring water.

86
00:06:07,055 --> 00:06:08,723
Live house has no water.

87
00:06:12,326 --> 00:06:15,062
Now the remaining members will chase after yon guys.

88
00:06:15,162 --> 00:06:17,297
So yon have to hurry finish the mission.

89
00:06:18,131 --> 00:06:20,534
We are the bundle experts, carrying it around our waists.

90
00:06:20,801 --> 00:06:23,269
We seem to be fated with escaping with a bundle.

91
00:06:24,204 --> 00:06:25,872
You are the expert with bundles.

92
00:06:26,573 --> 00:06:27,573
You hold on to it.

93
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,674
Young Master,

94
00:06:33,145 --> 00:06:34,747
Nampudong Jagalchi market.

95
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:35,614
That's right.

96
00:06:35,648 --> 00:06:37,216
This is exciting.

97
00:06:37,216 --> 00:06:38,550
Let's go.

98
00:06:39,051 --> 00:06:41,753
Ok, today we must win!

99
00:06:41,853 --> 00:06:43,355
I must win too!

100
00:06:43,555 --> 00:06:45,490
Da Hae, open the bundle.

101
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:47,592
You must protect it.

102
00:06:50,695 --> 00:06:51,429
Real?

103
00:06:51,495 --> 00:06:54,632
This is the real one, we must not let anyone snatch it, Oppa.

104
00:06:54,765 --> 00:06:57,634
Regarding this type of bundle, I have a deep understanding for it.

105
00:06:57,735 --> 00:06:59,636
I will keep it well.

106
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:01,772
It will not be snatched away!

107
00:07:16,885 --> 00:07:18,787
I am waiting for my partner right?

108
00:07:19,721 --> 00:07:22,357
Seems like there are 2 guests?

109
00:07:25,393 --> 00:07:27,328
Why is it the both of you?

110
00:07:27,362 --> 00:07:28,529
Why?

111
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:30,031
Are we forming a team like that?

112
00:07:30,164 --> 00:07:31,566
This is the mission.

113
00:07:31,666 --> 00:07:33,267
Oh, jeez.

114
00:07:34,935 --> 00:07:37,905
Hey. why are you unhappy with the order?

115
00:07:38,038 --> 00:07:40,474
-Do you think this is right? -It will be fine.

116
00:07:40,941 --> 00:07:42,175
Let's cheer first.

117
00:07:42,175 --> 00:07:43,243
I got it.

118
00:07:43,376 --> 00:07:43,944
Kook!

119
00:07:43,944 --> 00:07:44,544
Feel!

120
00:07:44,644 --> 00:07:45,045
Feel!

121
00:07:45,178 --> 00:07:46,846
Cross!

122
00:07:49,549 --> 00:07:52,251
They said the first team took the bundle away.

123
00:07:52,318 --> 00:07:54,954
However when I saw the microphone just now,

124
00:07:55,121 --> 00:07:58,057
Lee Da Hae's one is gone. HaHa's one is gone as well.

125
00:07:58,123 --> 00:08:00,559
Then there is another guest as well.

126
00:08:02,561 --> 00:08:06,665
Stop staying on TV and go solve unsolved crimes. Work for our country!

127
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:08,766
I think I really should.

128
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:11,335
I really want to try.

129
00:08:14,872 --> 00:08:15,439
Gary.

130
00:08:15,506 --> 00:08:16,273
Already.

131
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:17,975
We are the last again.

132
00:08:18,475 --> 00:08:20,878
But who is today's guest?

133
00:08:20,878 --> 00:08:21,979
That's right.

134
00:08:22,045 --> 00:08:23,146
In Busan.

135
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,749
Whose hometown is in Busan.

136
00:08:28,184 --> 00:08:30,153
I can't talk well in the mornings.

137
00:08:30,286 --> 00:08:33,489
When I came down from the elevator, some of the cleaning ladies,

138
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:36,492
were talking about those who left first.

139
00:08:36,625 --> 00:08:40,195
HaHa and Lee Da Hae.

140
00:08:40,362 --> 00:08:42,030
They said another name as well.

141
00:08:43,465 --> 00:08:44,666
Who is it?

142
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,835
They said Choi Ji Woo is here.

143
00:08:47,535 --> 00:08:49,170
I'm not sure if it's right.

144
00:08:49,637 --> 00:08:50,905
I really am her fan.

145
00:08:51,105 --> 00:08:51,639
Really?

146
00:08:51,673 --> 00:08:53,775
-Yes. I used to watch her dramas. -Really?

147
00:08:59,346 --> 00:09:02,349
Will it be all right if we do not label it?

148
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:03,984
What about using perfume?

149
00:09:05,886 --> 00:09:08,755
With the perfume we will know which one it is by smelling.

150
00:09:08,788 --> 00:09:10,356
Should I rub it?

151
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:12,825
My feminine fragrance.

152
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:24,503
Wow. you are really not easy from the start of the morning!

153
00:09:32,977 --> 00:09:34,545
Jagalchi.

154
00:09:34,645 --> 00:09:35,913
We've arrived! We've arrived!

155
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,548
I am starting to get nervous.

156
00:09:38,349 --> 00:09:39,683
Hyung it is here.

157
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:41,218
We've arrived.

158
00:09:41,385 --> 00:09:42,519
I am going crazy.

159
00:09:42,653 --> 00:09:43,587
I am going crazy.

160
00:09:43,587 --> 00:09:45,055
I am really going crazy!

161
00:09:45,188 --> 00:09:46,723
Ah, going crazy!

162
00:10:03,772 --> 00:10:05,374
Oh hyung, check out the feel,

163
00:10:05,374 --> 00:10:06,742
-Wow. -Huh? Oh.

164
00:10:08,577 --> 00:10:10,245
This is great, oppa.

165
00:10:10,245 --> 00:10:12,313
It really smells like Mokpo from my childhood.

166
00:10:12,413 --> 00:10:13,181
Is that so?

167
00:10:18,452 --> 00:10:22,690
Hello.

168
00:10:23,323 --> 00:10:25,592
-Oh hyung, here. -Do we put it here?

169
00:10:25,659 --> 00:10:26,260
Yes. put it here.

170
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:28,462
Oh? Who's here other than us?

171
00:10:31,064 --> 00:10:33,233
-These two are fakes. -Yes.

172
00:10:33,233 --> 00:10:37,136
You have to pass the mission to choose the real one first.

173
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:38,671
Yes.

174
00:10:42,775 --> 00:10:45,444
Ok then. I’ll give you the Jagalchi Market mission,

175
00:10:47,746 --> 00:10:52,517
After a team member sits in a hasin, buy the correct item in the box to succeed.

176
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:54,152
Basin?

177
00:10:54,152 --> 00:10:56,087
Yes. the basin's there.

178
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,455
-Ah. -Hey.

179
00:10:59,056 --> 00:11:00,891
-Is Miss Lee Da Hae sitting in it? -Yes.

180
00:11:00,891 --> 00:11:02,927
Both of you can't look. Mr Halia. come over here.

181
00:11:02,927 --> 00:11:04,962
-We can’t look? -Yes, you can't look.

182
00:11:04,962 --> 00:11:07,064
Miss Lee Da Hae. come over here and put your hand in.

183
00:11:07,064 --> 00:11:09,166
Huh? What is it, what, what?

184
00:11:09,166 --> 00:11:12,569
Just use your hand to confirm what's inside and buy it.

185
00:11:15,705 --> 00:11:17,473
-Don't be afraid. Don't be scared. -Don't look.

186
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:19,575
-No... -Look at me, look at me.

187
00:11:27,382 --> 00:11:28,784
Ah! Seems like it's moving!

188
00:11:28,784 --> 00:11:29,518
What?

189
00:11:29,518 --> 00:11:30,952
Is it moving?

190
00:11:30,952 --> 00:11:32,487
-Fell it properly, we have no time. -No, we have to do it quickly.

191
00:11:32,487 --> 00:11:34,189
-This, we still have to buy this back. -Hey.

192
00:11:34,189 --> 00:11:36,557
It's some kind of fish.

193
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:41,562
It's fish, with scales.

194
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:45,399
It also has a tail and it seems to have eyes.

195
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:47,067
That's of course.

196
00:11:48,035 --> 00:11:49,903
Hey, you've already touched it.

197
00:11:49,936 --> 00:11:51,505
It's soft, soft.

198
00:11:51,605 --> 00:11:53,173
Is it this thick?

199
00:11:53,173 --> 00:11:54,974
-Oh, a little... -Hairtail. hairtail.

200
00:11:54,974 --> 00:11:56,276
-Is it hairtail? -Hairtail.

201
00:11:56,376 --> 00:12:00,246
-But that's small. -Hairtail? But doesn't hairtail has big fins?

202
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:10,589
-I don't know, this is too hard. -Get on quickly.

203
00:12:10,655 --> 00:12:12,657
-It’s a fish. -Get on.

204
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,895
-We have to do it this way. -One, two, .three.

205
00:12:18,229 --> 00:12:21,332
-Lean towards Haha. -Like this?

206
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:25,035
Let's just buy it here.

207
00:12:25,636 --> 00:12:27,204
Take a good look.

208
00:12:27,571 --> 00:12:28,872
Is it this one?

209
00:12:29,006 --> 00:12:30,474
What are you looking for?

210
00:12:30,674 --> 00:12:32,576
Now, only her hand knows.

211
00:12:33,543 --> 00:12:35,745
-Oppa. it's not this. -It's not this one, it's not this one.

212
00:12:36,246 --> 00:12:38,581
Hang on, can't I touch it?

213
00:12:38,581 --> 00:12:40,583
-It’s too big, -Oh, right.

214
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:51,226
-Fish, fish. -Over there, over there.

215
00:12:51,226 --> 00:12:53,261
-Let’s have a look, -Over here, over here.

216
00:12:53,261 --> 00:12:54,996
Hey, there's so many here.

217
00:12:55,163 --> 00:12:56,931
-Eotnoni, what's this? -This is dried filefish.

218
00:12:56,965 --> 00:12:58,600
-What's this called? -Halibut - Is that so?

219
00:12:58,700 --> 00:12:59,934
-Halibut. -Halibut?

220
00:12:59,934 --> 00:13:01,702
It's flat like this.

221
00:13:01,736 --> 00:13:03,204
Was it wide?

222
00:13:05,005 --> 00:13:07,441
It's bigger than this,

223
00:13:08,175 --> 00:13:11,044
Ah. a bigger one. What's slightly bigger than this?

224
00:13:11,044 --> 00:13:13,046
I cut off its fins with a pair of scissors.

225
00:13:13,046 --> 00:13:16,282
If its fins were cut off by scissors, then this may be it

226
00:13:16,616 --> 00:13:17,317
Halibut?

227
00:13:18,885 --> 00:13:20,186
-I think this is it. -Halibut?

228
00:13:20,219 --> 00:13:23,022
Yes, halibut. But not those dried ones.

229
00:13:23,055 --> 00:13:24,523
-Not the dried ones. -Yes.

230
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:26,458
Let us have a Look at the halibut.

231
00:13:27,726 --> 00:13:28,927
Get one, get one.

232
00:13:29,795 --> 00:13:31,096
Take them all.

233
00:13:31,096 --> 00:13:32,397
Isn't this too big?

234
00:13:32,497 --> 00:13:35,300
-Here, put it here. -Isn't that too big?

235
00:13:36,401 --> 00:13:37,869
Is it the same feel?

236
00:13:37,869 --> 00:13:38,369
Oh?

237
00:13:38,369 --> 00:13:39,971
Touch its fins.

238
00:13:39,971 --> 00:13:41,172
The fins are very soft.

239
00:13:41,806 --> 00:13:43,674
No, it was this big.

240
00:13:43,674 --> 00:13:46,577
This is it. Let's just buy this.

241
00:13:46,744 --> 00:13:48,479
Halibut, halibut.

242
00:13:48,479 --> 00:13:50,114
Was it that flat?

243
00:13:50,247 --> 00:13:51,582
Hey. the money, the money.

244
00:13:52,182 --> 00:13:53,583
Thank you.

245
00:13:54,985 --> 00:13:56,920
-Oh, oh. -Oh, it's here.

246
00:13:57,587 --> 00:13:58,822
Hey, are we second?

247
00:13:58,822 --> 00:13:59,923
Yes. you're second.

248
00:13:59,989 --> 00:14:02,925
Is that so? Why are we second? They left before us.

249
00:14:03,025 --> 00:14:05,594
-That team got lost on the road. -Ah, is that so?

250
00:14:06,362 --> 00:14:07,830
See, hyung.

251
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:10,132
-Ok, there are three hundles. -Yes. yes.

252
00:14:10,165 --> 00:14:12,334
One of them is the real bundle,

253
00:14:16,104 --> 00:14:20,041
If you're the first to pass, you'll get to choose one bundle first.

254
00:14:20,074 --> 00:14:20,875
Ah, is that so?

255
00:14:20,875 --> 00:14:23,177
-Go, go, what's the game? -Hurry, hurry.

256
00:14:23,845 --> 00:14:29,583
Ok, one team member sits in a basin, buy the correct item in the box to succeed.

257
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:32,219
Buy the item inside this box?

258
00:14:35,856 --> 00:14:37,257
Ah, what's this?

259
00:14:37,357 --> 00:14:39,459
Oh, no!

260
00:14:39,926 --> 00:14:41,227
Is it hairtail?

261
00:14:41,227 --> 00:14:41,961
Ji Hyo,

262
00:14:41,961 --> 00:14:44,964
I really hate this sort of scary stuff.

263
00:14:45,198 --> 00:14:47,033
Hey, how did you guys reach so early?

264
00:14:47,533 --> 00:14:48,767
Oh, they're here.

265
00:14:49,868 --> 00:14:52,037
How did you get here so early?

266
00:14:52,137 --> 00:14:53,338
Why are you so late?

267
00:14:53,438 --> 00:14:54,973
We took the wrong way.

268
00:14:55,073 --> 00:14:57,075
And also, this is probably...

269
00:14:57,075 --> 00:14:58,943
This is Ja"gaichi Market,

270
00:14:59,244 --> 00:15:02,313
it's just some kind of fish.

271
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:05,683
Just get the feel, 'get the feel.

272
00:15:06,717 --> 00:15:08,119
Just get the feel.

273
00:15:10,054 --> 00:15:10,988
Just the feel.

274
00:15:11,689 --> 00:15:14,691
-Hey, how can you do this? Ji Hyo's a girl. -It's alright.

275
00:15:14,758 --> 00:15:17,060
-She's a girl -It’s fine.

276
00:15:18,295 --> 00:15:20,930
-Hey, put your hand in... -Hey. don't!

277
00:15:21,598 --> 00:15:24,233
Don't do that, don't!

278
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:27,570
-I already said I’m very scared now. -Grab it at once!

279
00:15:27,603 --> 00:15:29,171
Hey, it's a scorpion, a scorpion.

280
00:15:29,505 --> 00:15:30,706
Hey..

281
00:15:33,342 --> 00:15:35,143
Why would there be scorpions in Jagalchi Market?

282
00:15:35,177 --> 00:15:36,645
Hey. it's a large crab.

283
00:15:36,945 --> 00:15:38,146
Is it dangerous?

284
00:15:38,146 --> 00:15:39,114
It's safe.

285
00:15:39,214 --> 00:15:41,316
-It's safe, just grab it. -Ji Hyo, don't worry.

286
00:15:41,349 --> 00:15:44,585
-What did you feel? -What is it what is it?

287
00:15:55,596 --> 00:15:56,897
That's it, Ji Hyo.

288
00:15:58,598 --> 00:16:01,668
-What is it? -You touched it?

289
00:16:02,435 --> 00:16:03,703
It’s still alive!

290
00:16:03,703 --> 00:16:04,871
It's something alive.

291
00:16:05,238 --> 00:16:06,906
It's alive.

292
00:16:06,906 --> 00:16:07,874
Wait a moment!

293
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:09,875
Ji Hyo. don’t worry.

294
00:16:11,243 --> 00:16:12,444
What's this?

295
00:16:12,945 --> 00:16:14,713
Did you touch it?

296
00:16:14,813 --> 00:16:16,582
Oh, it's a fish?

297
00:16:17,816 --> 00:16:21,052
-What's it like? -But the fish isn't moving.

298
00:16:21,252 --> 00:16:24,622
Five, four...

299
00:16:30,327 --> 00:16:32,162
I was slapped by its tail!

300
00:16:32,263 --> 00:16:35,065
The tail hits you? Who hit you with its tail?

301
00:16:35,566 --> 00:16:37,934
Who slapped you with its tail?

302
00:16:38,969 --> 00:16:41,071
-Ji Hyo. do you know? -I don't know.

303
00:16:41,137 --> 00:16:42,472
Ah, so this is alive?

304
00:16:42,706 --> 00:16:43,673
What was its size?

305
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:45,275
Oppa, it was, it was...

306
00:16:46,242 --> 00:16:47,343
About this big?

307
00:16:47,877 --> 00:16:49,645
Was it thick or not?

308
00:16:50,446 --> 00:16:51,914
I felt it like this.

309
00:16:51,947 --> 00:16:53,616
It was very slippery.

310
00:16:53,849 --> 00:16:56,885
It was, it was like a fish.

311
00:17:01,756 --> 00:17:03,625
Is there something famous around here?

312
00:17:03,625 --> 00:17:06,561
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

313
00:17:07,595 --> 00:17:09,230
A famous thing in Jagalchi Market.

314
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:10,197
No, no, oppa.

315
00:17:10,231 --> 00:17:12,900
Skinny people are having a hard time carrying.

316
00:17:13,667 --> 00:17:16,570
Ji Hyo is not really skinny.

317
00:17:17,604 --> 00:17:20,774
-Ji Hyo's is not skinny. -Hyung, is that it?

318
00:17:20,774 --> 00:17:21,575
What?

319
00:17:21,775 --> 00:17:25,245
-A croaker? It’s not it.

320
00:17:25,879 --> 00:17:28,281
You put it down because it was heavy, right?

321
00:17:28,314 --> 00:17:30,249
-Seems like I'm right. -Ji Hyo!

322
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:34,286
Put your hand in.

323
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:36,989
Feel what it's like. Feel around.

324
00:17:36,989 --> 00:17:39,191
-Don't take out your hand. -Oh. seems like there's nothing?

325
00:17:39,191 --> 00:17:41,059
Hey, how can you do this?

326
00:17:41,059 --> 00:17:42,794
-Don't take it out. -There isn't anything.

327
00:17:44,662 --> 00:17:46,998
-Oh hang on, hang on! -Hang on, stay still.

328
00:17:47,031 --> 00:17:48,333
What is it? Touch it.

329
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,735
Touch it well.

330
00:17:51,502 --> 00:17:54,104
Did you touch it. did you touch it?

331
00:17:54,104 --> 00:17:56,173
Seems like lt's a loach.

332
00:18:01,578 --> 00:18:03,079
It's about this big. Let's go first.

333
00:18:03,146 --> 00:18:04,114
Ok, sef off.

334
00:18:04,114 --> 00:18:05,582
Hyung, it's a loach?

335
00:18:05,582 --> 00:18:07,784
Hang in there. We're there.

336
00:18:07,951 --> 00:18:09,986
-Who’s with... -Ah^Mr Oh Ji Ho!

337
00:18:10,419 --> 00:18:11,787
-Hyung. -We re here.

338
00:18:14,523 --> 00:18:16,825
They said Choi Ji Woo was coming.

339
00:18:16,825 --> 00:18:18,026
So it's Oh Ji Ho.

340
00:18:19,861 --> 00:18:21,630
Ah really, where...

341
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:23,732
You look like a servant among the three.

342
00:18:23,832 --> 00:18:25,767
Hyung. it's the same for you in your team.

343
00:18:27,168 --> 00:18:31,038
Hey, they're a couple of lovers going out in secret. What are you doing there?

344
00:18:31,072 --> 00:18:33,240
This love triangle isn't a joke.

345
00:18:33,274 --> 00:18:34,475
Aigoo really.

346
00:18:34,675 --> 00:18:36,443
-Let's see if we're right. -Ok let's go.

347
00:18:36,477 --> 00:18:38,045
-We're.here. -What did you say?

348
00:18:38,679 --> 00:18:39,847
Move forward.

349
00:18:40,814 --> 00:18:42,849
Hey, a fish that's this big.

350
00:18:42,849 --> 00:18:44,584
What type of fish is this big?

351
00:18:44,618 --> 00:18:46,519
If it's from the sea. it's definitely not loach.

352
00:18:46,519 --> 00:18:48,521
The other teams carried girls in the basin!

353
00:18:54,527 --> 00:18:55,728
Please be correct.

354
00:18:55,861 --> 00:18:57,830
-Lets get this in one try. -We're in trouble if its not the one.

355
00:18:57,830 --> 00:18:59,498
I think it's too big. right?

356
00:18:59,498 --> 00:19:01,667
It's bigger but maybe it was a baby.

357
00:19:01,667 --> 00:19:02,834
What's the name of the fish?

358
00:19:02,834 --> 00:19:04,136
-It's halibut. -Halibut.

359
00:19:04,302 --> 00:19:05,270
The correct answer is...

360
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:07,005
Its right, it's right.

361
00:19:07,005 --> 00:19:09,040
We'll give you a halibut set.

362
00:19:09,374 --> 00:19:11,976
We'll give you all of this 10.000 won!

363
00:19:11,976 --> 00:19:13,978
This answer is...

364
00:19:18,749 --> 00:19:20,451
incorrect.

365
00:19:20,517 --> 00:19:21,585
Incorrect.

366
00:19:21,652 --> 00:19:23,687
Going crazy!

367
00:19:23,687 --> 00:19:24,688
I'm about crazy.

368
00:19:24,721 --> 00:19:26,089
Ah, I'm seriously going crazy.

369
00:19:26,222 --> 00:19:27,657
Hurry, hurry.

370
00:19:27,757 --> 00:19:28,391
Hurry.

371
00:19:28,425 --> 00:19:30,493
Hey, we were too focused on the fins.

372
00:19:33,396 --> 00:19:35,865
This.,.you stop moving about!

373
00:19:36,098 --> 00:19:38,734
-Hey, touch the face. -Turn your body a little.

374
00:19:39,535 --> 00:19:40,702
It's big, it's big.

375
00:19:40,736 --> 00:19:42,504
It's prickly.

376
00:19:42,638 --> 00:19:44,339
Oh. Hang on, stay still, stay still.

377
00:19:44,339 --> 00:19:47,776
Oh! Oppa, I know it. I know it.

378
00:19:49,944 --> 00:19:52,480
-Ah Ji Hyo. this fish... -No oppa, it's like this.

379
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:58,219
It's about that size. How I do you put it? There are no scales and slippery.

380
00:19:58,219 --> 00:19:59,153
Is that so?

381
00:19:59,219 --> 00:20:01,355
Is there any fish without scales?

382
00:20:01,555 --> 00:20:02,389
Mackerel.

383
00:20:02,389 --> 00:20:04,157
-Do mackerels not have scales? -Mackerel,

384
00:20:04,758 --> 00:20:05,692
Sailfin sandfish.

385
00:20:05,692 --> 00:20:06,560
-What? -Sailfin sandfish.

386
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:07,227
Sailfin sandfish!

387
00:20:07,227 --> 00:20:09,929
-That's right, boss. It seemed like sailfin sandfish. -It felt like a sailfin sandfish.

388
00:20:09,963 --> 00:20:12,298
-Sailfin sandfish, sailfin sandfish. -It is very slippery right?

389
00:20:13,066 --> 00:20:14,300
Boss, is it right?

390
00:20:16,802 --> 00:20:20,539
It will be great if this is right.

391
00:20:20,639 --> 00:20:22,174
Here you go, boss.

392
00:20:22,174 --> 00:20:24,276
-Thanks. -Thank you!

393
00:20:24,476 --> 00:20:27,078
Let's take a look at the fish there first.

394
00:20:27,078 --> 00:20:28,513
-See which one it is. -Hyung, take a good look.

395
00:20:28,513 --> 00:20:31,583
-In the water, the fish was this big. -Alright, what was it like?

396
00:20:31,649 --> 00:20:32,884
-It was thin. -Thin?

397
00:20:32,984 --> 00:20:34,152
-Thin, thin. -Was it slippery?

398
00:20:34,185 --> 00:20:36,020
-Right, it was slippery. -Then it's an octopus.

399
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:37,755
-No. no. -It's a fish.

400
00:20:37,755 --> 00:20:39,256
It's a fish.

401
00:20:39,256 --> 00:20:40,257
Was it a fish?

402
00:20:40,257 --> 00:20:41,959
-An eel? -It's very slippery.

403
00:20:42,259 --> 00:20:43,293
Aha!

404
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:44,795
A sea eel.

405
00:20:44,895 --> 00:20:46,663
Did you say sea eel?

406
00:20:46,663 --> 00:20:48,632
-How big was it? -It's a sea eel. hyung.

407
00:20:48,632 --> 00:20:49,966
-About this? -Hyung!

408
00:20:49,966 --> 00:20:51,267
This is Busan after all.

409
00:20:51,468 --> 00:20:53,002
-One, two, three. -Slowly.

410
00:20:53,636 --> 00:20:55,538
You guys make me uneasy.

411
00:20:55,905 --> 00:20:56,672
Hang on.

412
00:20:57,306 --> 00:20:58,641
Hyung, hyung.

413
00:21:00,042 --> 00:21:02,344
-Hey, just think of me as Lee Da Hae. -Hyung, how?

414
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:05,013
-Think of me as Lee Da Hae. -It's so weird,

415
00:21:05,013 --> 00:21:06,581
Hyung. Wait a sec.

416
00:21:07,816 --> 00:21:09,951
Where do you sell sea eel, eomonis?

417
00:21:10,051 --> 00:21:11,486
-Where? -Basement.

418
00:21:11,486 --> 00:21:12,754
-They have sea eels? -Yes.

419
00:21:12,754 --> 00:21:14,222
Hey, we have to go to the basement.

420
00:21:14,222 --> 00:21:15,957
Not the basement.

421
00:21:18,326 --> 00:21:19,994
Right, this one.

422
00:21:19,994 --> 00:21:21,862
-What’s this? -This one, this one.

423
00:21:21,862 --> 00:21:22,830
That's rock trout.

424
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:23,764
Rock trout!

425
00:21:23,764 --> 00:21:25,165
We have to feel the rock trout.

426
00:21:25,165 --> 00:21:27,534
-Rock trout is right. -We have to touch it.

427
00:21:28,235 --> 00:21:30,437
-I'll know once I touch it. -That's what we thought at first.

428
00:21:31,204 --> 00:21:32,939
-This is it! -It's right!

429
00:21:32,939 --> 00:21:36,542
-Are you 100% sure its right? -Rock trout, so it was you, it was you!

430
00:21:36,542 --> 00:21:37,276
Ok.

431
00:21:39,278 --> 00:21:41,947
-We're done. -Thank you.

432
00:21:41,947 --> 00:21:43,349
-Wow. -Get on.

433
00:21:43,382 --> 00:21:45,250
It looks delicious.

434
00:21:49,488 --> 00:21:50,755
We have to go quickly.

435
00:21:50,755 --> 00:21:52,590
We have no time for delicious food.

436
00:22:01,599 --> 00:22:04,401
Hey, don’t you think that looks delicious?

437
00:22:05,602 --> 00:22:07,938
Let’s eat one, hyung.

438
00:22:08,171 --> 00:22:09,639
Let's try one.

439
00:22:14,344 --> 00:22:16,479
Let's go! We'll finish quickly and come back later.

440
00:22:16,546 --> 00:22:18,381
-Right, right. -Let's go, let's go.

441
00:22:18,381 --> 00:22:19,615
-Get our act together. -Let's go.

442
00:22:19,749 --> 00:22:21,917
Have a bite before you go.

443
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:29,224
Should we?

444
00:22:29,224 --> 00:22:31,393
-Really? -Ah, do we have to?

445
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:34,028
Aunty is preventing us from going back.

446
00:22:37,331 --> 00:22:40,067
Mm. it's so delicious.

447
00:22:41,569 --> 00:22:43,337
-It's good right? -Yes.

448
00:22:43,637 --> 00:22:44,838
Is there any rice?

449
00:22:50,977 --> 00:22:54,314
The fish-we chose is, precisely...

450
00:22:54,647 --> 00:22:56,916
Sailfin sandfish.

451
00:22:57,116 --> 00:22:58,284
Sailfin sandfish.

452
00:22:59,385 --> 00:23:01,387
This fish is...

453
00:23:02,955 --> 00:23:04,657
- not it. -Jeez.

454
00:23:05,758 --> 00:23:08,160
- not it. -Jeez.

455
00:23:08,427 --> 00:23:10,529
It's a completely useless sailfin sandfish!

456
00:23:10,529 --> 00:23:13,565
-How do you know it's useless? -Other than being useless there isn't any other.

457
00:23:13,565 --> 00:23:16,834
But. this is 10.000 won...

458
00:23:16,834 --> 00:23:20,938
-The stuff will turn it into something delicious later -Yes. this is delicious. it will be delicious.

459
00:23:21,539 --> 00:23:23,340
This is such a pity.

460
00:23:23,441 --> 00:23:24,675
Ok. ten seconds.

461
00:23:25,276 --> 00:23:26,343
Ah!

462
00:23:27,644 --> 00:23:30,614
Not being able to see this is very terrifying.

463
00:23:30,714 --> 00:23:32,616
Yoo Jae Suk!

464
00:23:32,616 --> 00:23:35,685
Yoo Jae Suk, Yoo Jae Suk!

465
00:23:35,685 --> 00:23:37,854
Hyung, you can do it!

466
00:23:37,854 --> 00:23:39,689
I thank you for cheering me on like this.

467
00:23:39,689 --> 00:23:40,756
Touch the fish.

468
00:23:41,857 --> 00:23:44,727
Hyung, this is all for simply touching a fish!

469
00:23:45,027 --> 00:23:45,928
Ten seconds.

470
00:23:46,295 --> 00:23:47,396
What to do.

471
00:23:48,163 --> 00:23:49,298
-What to do? -Hyung.

472
00:23:49,298 --> 00:23:51,967
Just put your hand and the fish will do it for you.

473
00:23:52,067 --> 00:23:53,568
It knows how to do it.

474
00:23:56,304 --> 00:23:57,872
-Hyung, hyung. -Hang on, hang on.

475
00:23:57,872 --> 00:24:00,374
It's not usual right?

476
00:24:01,042 --> 00:24:02,043
Ok, stop!

477
00:24:02,043 --> 00:24:04,378
-Not yet, we haven't... -Jeez, it's here!

478
00:24:04,678 --> 00:24:06,146
There really is something.

479
00:24:06,146 --> 00:24:08,115
I got it at the end.

480
00:24:08,115 --> 00:24:09,516
I touched a hit of it.

481
00:24:09,516 --> 00:24:11,318
You have to grab it, hyung.

482
00:24:11,451 --> 00:24:12,019
We bought it,

483
00:24:12,019 --> 00:24:16,556
-Carrying a guy is too tiring. -But the fish felt ordinary to me.

484
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:19,659
Oppa. let's take a look before coming back.

485
00:24:22,028 --> 00:24:23,262
Ok, what's this?

486
00:24:23,996 --> 00:24:26,298
-Hyung, look. -Hyung, is that right?

487
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:27,099
Is this right?

488
00:24:27,099 --> 00:24:28,267
Feel it. feel it.

489
00:24:28,267 --> 00:24:30,636
-Hey, it wasn't this big. -Just feel it first.

490
00:24:30,836 --> 00:24:32,304
Oh. this is it.

491
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:34,906
Ah, this is the one, this one.

492
00:24:34,906 --> 00:24:36,441
Let's go.

493
00:24:37,275 --> 00:24:38,743
One, two, three,

494
00:24:38,743 --> 00:24:39,744
Sea eel.

495
00:24:40,545 --> 00:24:42,246
This is..,

496
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:44,815
This is...

497
00:24:45,583 --> 00:24:48,018
- tiie correct answer. -Yeah!

498
00:24:48,018 --> 00:24:49,453
Yeah!

499
00:24:49,453 --> 00:24:52,723
-We survived, we survived. -Hey!

500
00:24:52,723 --> 00:24:53,957
I told you we'd survive!

501
00:24:53,957 --> 00:24:59,996
Kim Jong Kook. Kim jong Kook.

502
00:25:00,396 --> 00:25:01,731
Hey, seems like someone got it right.

503
00:25:01,831 --> 00:25:03,599
No way, that won't happen.

504
00:25:03,599 --> 00:25:06,569
-Aren't they in front of the bundles? -Lei's move quickly. Hurry, hurry.

505
00:25:06,569 --> 00:25:09,204
Hey, we have to choose the real one.

506
00:25:09,204 --> 00:25:11,673
Only one of these bundles is the real one.

507
00:25:14,576 --> 00:25:16,177
Hyung, they've switched them.

508
00:25:16,177 --> 00:25:19,080
-He's truly the Commander. -He really is the Commander.

509
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:21,616
They won't find the real bundle.

510
00:25:21,616 --> 00:25:22,884
They won't get it.

511
00:25:22,884 --> 00:25:24,485
Please. I beg you.

512
00:25:24,485 --> 00:25:26,454
It's on the right side.

513
00:25:26,454 --> 00:25:28,088
Yes, it's on the right side.

514
00:25:30,024 --> 00:25:33,126
Hey, these two are loosened but this one is tight.

515
00:25:33,126 --> 00:25:35,796
But this is too light.

516
00:25:41,434 --> 00:25:43,536
-It's fine, it's fine. -Which one did they pick?

517
00:25:46,439 --> 00:25:49,575
-Go to the used bookstore in Bosu-dong anti find the Running Man... -Let's go, let's go.

518
00:25:54,246 --> 00:25:56,781
-Ok. -You'll be surprised.

519
00:25:56,781 --> 00:25:58,183
This is the correct answer.

520
00:25:58,183 --> 00:25:59,017
Ok.

521
00:25:59,017 --> 00:26:00,185
Hey.

522
00:26:00,185 --> 00:26:04,188
-This kid's name is... -Rock trout, rock trout.

523
00:26:04,188 --> 00:26:05,990
One. two, three!

524
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:07,124
Rock trout!

525
00:26:07,425 --> 00:26:08,893
You're surprised, right?

526
00:26:09,193 --> 00:26:10,661
Ok. this is...

527
00:26:11,528 --> 00:26:13,330
This is...

528
00:26:14,264 --> 00:26:18,501
-The correct answer. -Yeah!

529
00:26:18,768 --> 00:26:20,603
I'm seriously going crazy, seriously.

530
00:26:20,603 --> 00:26:22,939
-I'm going crazy. -I'm just about crazy.

531
00:26:22,939 --> 00:26:24,741
Two, three. Crazy.

532
00:26:24,741 --> 00:26:25,575
Let's go. let's go,

533
00:26:25,575 --> 00:26:29,044
-We're the only one who seem to enjoy this. -Yes, we're the only one enjoying it.

534
00:26:29,145 --> 00:26:30,479
You get away!

535
00:26:30,479 --> 00:26:32,247
You should get lost.

536
00:26:32,381 --> 00:26:34,483
I'm the one chosen!

537
00:26:35,050 --> 00:26:36,151
My feelings...

538
00:26:36,151 --> 00:26:37,319
Hey!

539
00:26:37,786 --> 00:26:39,654
The one who affects my mood.

540
00:26:41,756 --> 00:26:43,625
I think this is the one.

541
00:26:43,625 --> 00:26:44,625
I think this is it.

542
00:26:45,226 --> 00:26:50,931
-it was the right shape but I think it was re-wrapped a little. -They must be shuffled.

543
00:26:50,931 --> 00:26:51,799
It was shuffled.

544
00:26:51,799 --> 00:26:53,734
It's shuffled but I think this is the one.

545
00:26:53,734 --> 00:26:55,235
We choose this one.

546
00:26:56,470 --> 00:26:58,538
The fish you brought back...

547
00:26:59,239 --> 00:27:00,974
This isn't the correct one.

548
00:27:00,974 --> 00:27:02,442
Ah, oppa.

549
00:27:02,675 --> 00:27:05,845
-This mackerel, please accept it as the correct answer. -Definitely not.

550
00:27:05,845 --> 00:27:07,547
Being born in this ocean...

551
00:27:07,547 --> 00:27:09,482
-What will it become? -What will it become?

552
00:27:09,482 --> 00:27:10,816
What does it turn into?

553
00:27:10,816 --> 00:27:13,018
Consider this mackerel's position for once.

554
00:27:13,018 --> 00:27:14,186
Ok. set off.

555
00:27:16,054 --> 00:27:19,257
Da Hae. hyung, take a look if it's real of fake.

556
00:27:19,524 --> 00:27:20,125
Please.

557
00:27:20,125 --> 00:27:22,594
Please, please!

558
00:27:22,594 --> 00:27:24,028
I think ours is the real one.

559
00:27:24,028 --> 00:27:25,830
I feet it's the real one.

560
00:27:26,097 --> 00:27:28,532
The real one. the real one.

561
00:27:29,734 --> 00:27:31,569
Please, please!

562
00:27:31,569 --> 00:27:34,505
Is it the real one or a fake? May it be the real one!

563
00:27:43,046 --> 00:27:44,380
Ah, it's a fake.

564
00:27:44,647 --> 00:27:46,249
Ah, its a fake.

565
00:27:48,217 --> 00:27:50,286
Seems like they didn't change the position. 0.

566
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:52,555
It's the real one!	0.

567
00:27:52,555 --> 00:27:53,922
The real one!

568
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:55,390
It's the real one!

569
00:27:55,390 --> 00:27:59,194
The real one!

570
00:27:59,194 --> 00:28:02,063
Ah, it's real!

571
00:28:05,333 --> 00:28:08,669
Hyung, these two are loosened, this one is tighter.

572
00:28:08,669 --> 00:28:11,305
But this is too, bulky.

573
00:28:14,875 --> 00:28:17,144
-Then I choose this too. -This doesn't seem like it.

574
00:28:17,277 --> 00:28:20,347
-This one, this is the right one. -This one, this one.

575
00:28:20,447 --> 00:28:21,748
-Swap their positions. -Right.

576
00:28:24,184 --> 00:28:26,019
They'll think this is the correct one.

577
00:28:26,686 --> 00:28:28,821
Ah. a fake.

578
00:28:28,821 --> 00:28:30,723
Then we have to get it back during the next game.

579
00:28:30,723 --> 00:28:33,192
So the team in front took it.

580
00:28:33,225 --> 00:28:37,729
-We have to remember this one. -Right, we have to remember it so that we don't pick this.

581
00:28:40,966 --> 00:28:44,202
Then, shall we mark this as a fake?

582
00:28:44,202 --> 00:28:45,003
How?

583
00:28:45,003 --> 00:28:49,540
I'll apply, a bit of this on it.

584
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:50,441
Oh good. good.

585
00:28:50,541 --> 00:28:51,475
Lip gloss.

586
00:28:51,475 --> 00:28:53,744
Great, great. Good job.

587
00:28:54,645 --> 00:28:57,114
The opposing side will think it's actually the real one.

588
00:28:57,114 --> 00:29:00,117
-They'll mistake it as the real one. -That's right.

589
00:29:00,283 --> 00:29:04,788
-But we're not sure if those in front have the real one. -Right.

590
00:29:04,788 --> 00:29:06,756
-Anyway this isn't it. -This isn't it.

591
00:29:06,756 --> 00:29:07,790
We can't pick this.

592
00:29:08,691 --> 00:29:10,259
-Ok, set off. -Set off.

593
00:29:12,595 --> 00:29:15,798
Slippery slippery fish! A mullet!

594
00:29:15,798 --> 00:29:16,999
A mullet.

595
00:29:16,999 --> 00:29:18,734
Ok. this is...

596
00:29:18,967 --> 00:29:21,069
- the correct answer. -Ah!

597
00:29:21,737 --> 00:29:23,071
Open it first.

598
00:29:23,071 --> 00:29:24,673
You never know it could be...

599
00:29:24,939 --> 00:29:25,774
Huh?

600
00:29:25,774 --> 00:29:28,276
-Jeez, it's a cushion. -See, its not the one.

601
00:29:28,576 --> 00:29:32,480
Ji Ho hyung seems to have it.

602
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,582
Miss Lee Da Hae called him.

603
00:29:35,182 --> 00:29:41,388
-She planned to come here and win on Running Man. -Seriously. Lee Da Hae is doing it all*.

604
00:29:41,388 --> 00:29:42,856
I'll do everything.

605
00:29:42,856 --> 00:29:45,292
There's also a servant following them?

606
00:29:46,226 --> 00:29:47,427
Servant...

607
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:50,997
-Servant Ha. -Servant Ha.

608
00:29:58,170 --> 00:30:00,772
-Seems like it's bleeding. -Does it hurt?

609
00:30:02,574 --> 00:30:05,443
-Seems like you were pricked by the fish. -The fish?

610
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:10,114
We’re at the Bosu-dong Bookstore Alley.

611
00:30:10,114 --> 00:30:12,316
It's one of Busan's famous destinations.

612
00:30:13,251 --> 00:30:14,285
We have to hurry, hyung.

613
00:30:14,285 --> 00:30:15,086
Let's go.

614
00:30:15,653 --> 00:30:17,288
It's like Hong Kong, Hong Kong,

615
00:30:17,688 --> 00:30:20,657
-Over there. -Wow, are these all second-hand books?

616
00:30:33,236 --> 00:30:34,804
There’s Myeok PD.

617
00:30:34,804 --> 00:30:36,405
-We're the first. -Myeok PD.

618
00:30:38,107 --> 00:30:39,975
-Your expression's a bit... -We’re still alive.

619
00:30:40,509 --> 00:30:43,078
Find a book with a Running Man sticker on it.

620
00:30:43,111 --> 00:30:45,247
Where do we find it? Everything there?

621
00:30:45,347 --> 00:30:47,015
How many books are there?

622
00:30:47,148 --> 00:30:48,516
Ah, in here?

623
00:30:49,417 --> 00:30:52,120
Where do we find it?

624
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:54,355
The bookstore's really big.

625
00:30:54,855 --> 00:30:56,891
There are more upstairs?

626
00:31:03,797 --> 00:31:05,899
Hey, how do I find this?

627
00:31:07,901 --> 00:31:09,102
In here?

628
00:31:13,106 --> 00:31:14,607
There’s a bookstore here.

629
00:31:15,174 --> 00:31:17,576
-There's a mission here. -We have to find something.

630
00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:19,745
Find a book with a Running Man sticker on it.

631
00:31:19,745 --> 00:31:22,381
How do we find it among so many books?

632
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:24,583
Let's find it quickly, let's find it quickly.

633
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:29,254
What? Why are there so many bundles?

634
00:31:30,355 --> 00:31:31,122
Why?

635
00:31:34,826 --> 00:31:37,762
There are around 300,000 books in here.

636
00:31:37,762 --> 00:31:40,964
Really, why make the game so easy? Only 300,000 books.

637
00:31:43,534 --> 00:31:44,835
Hello!

638
00:31:44,935 --> 00:31:47,871
Hey, look at that. Oh, it’s so cool. Oh, hello.

639
00:31:47,871 --> 00:31:49,005
Wow, cool.

640
00:31:49,406 --> 00:31:50,507
Hello boss.

641
00:31:50,507 --> 00:31:51,875
Hey, this is cool.

642
00:31:51,875 --> 00:31:54,577
Find a book with the Running Man 'R' sticker.

643
00:31:59,014 --> 00:32:02,918
Topics related to Running Man?

644
00:32:03,185 --> 00:32:07,255
Foreign language? Running Man... English...

645
00:32:08,156 --> 00:32:09,691
Sports.

646
00:32:09,691 --> 00:32:11,392
Because it's Running.

647
00:32:16,964 --> 00:32:19,133
Hey. why are you looking in the 'Sex' section?

648
00:32:19,133 --> 00:32:20,134
It may be in here.

649
00:32:20,134 --> 00:32:21,869
Why are you looking at the ’Adult' section?

650
00:32:22,236 --> 00:32:23,704
Ah, seriously.

651
00:32:33,513 --> 00:32:36,315
I want to show them that I can find it.

652
00:32:37,416 --> 00:32:40,986
This time, I'll find it first.

653
00:32:40,986 --> 00:32:43,288
This is my first time at a second-hand bookstore.

654
00:32:43,522 --> 00:32:44,990
Hey, hey.

655
00:32:45,123 --> 00:32:46,625
Wow, they even have this here.

656
00:32:52,130 --> 00:32:54,465
There are old dictionaries here.

657
00:32:55,166 --> 00:32:57,869
There should be one here.

658
00:32:58,736 --> 00:33:00,104
How do we find it?

659
00:33:00,204 --> 00:33:03,574
-It's not inside the book, right? -No oppa. it should be stuck on the outside,

660
00:33:19,255 --> 00:33:20,656
Oppa.

661
00:33:21,257 --> 00:33:22,358
Huh?

662
00:33:29,931 --> 00:33:31,933
Oh.

663
00:33:47,681 --> 00:33:49,082
HaHa!

664
00:33:49,082 --> 00:33:50,283
Oppa, oppa.

665
00:33:50,350 --> 00:33:51,785
Ok, let's go!

666
00:33:51,818 --> 00:33:52,285
What?

667
00:33:52,285 --> 00:33:54,020
I'm going crazy.

668
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:56,155
You found it?

669
00:33:56,756 --> 00:33:59,625
-I really found it. -Where did you find it?

670
00:33:59,625 --> 00:34:00,593
Wow, really?

671
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:01,627
You really found it.

672
00:34:02,595 --> 00:34:03,229
Wow.

673
00:34:03,262 --> 00:34:04,897
-Where did you find it? -Hyung, where did you find it?

674
00:34:05,064 --> 00:34:06,165
Up there.

675
00:34:07,132 --> 00:34:09,434
The Purple Team can choose...

676
00:34:09,701 --> 00:34:10,936
Yeah!

677
00:34:10,936 --> 00:34:12,604
-Yes, yes! -Yes!

678
00:34:12,604 --> 00:34:14,372
-Choose two. -Oh?

679
00:34:27,551 --> 00:34:28,719
0nce you touch it. you choose it.

680
00:34:28,752 --> 00:34:30,153
Two and four?

681
00:34:35,058 --> 00:34:35,625
Two?

682
00:34:35,692 --> 00:34:37,493
-They can take two? -Two.

683
00:34:40,163 --> 00:34:41,197
-Ok, let's go. -Daebak.

684
00:34:41,497 --> 00:34:43,032
Let's go, oppa. Let's go.

685
00:34:44,033 --> 00:34:45,801
Hey, where at Haeundae?

686
00:34:45,801 --> 00:34:49,004
Go to Haeundae Beach to find the Running Man banner.

687
00:34:49,004 --> 00:34:51,373
Take a look, Ji Hyo and Gary.

688
00:34:51,373 --> 00:34:52,674
Firstly, let’s...

689
00:34:52,674 --> 00:34:55,377
But. it seems all of them are cushions?

690
00:34:57,245 --> 00:34:58,680
-Oh, hyung! -What?

691
00:35:01,048 --> 00:35:03,451
Hey this, what’s this?

692
00:35:04,485 --> 00:35:07,521
-Daebak! Daebak! -Hey. this really no joke.

693
00:35:08,789 --> 00:35:10,591
We did it. We did it.

694
00:35:10,624 --> 00:35:13,093
Hey. we turned the tables, thanks to you!

695
00:35:13,627 --> 00:35:14,361
It's done.

696
00:35:18,231 --> 00:35:19,465
No.

697
00:35:19,465 --> 00:35:22,335
What's with this bundle? Jeez.

698
00:35:23,035 --> 00:35:27,506
-The team with the real one must be excited. -They must be Feeling great,

699
00:36:00,069 --> 00:36:01,671
Ji Hyo.

700
00:36:02,605 --> 00:36:04,273
Oppa, I'm sorry.

701
00:36:04,674 --> 00:36:06,675
Sleep more, sleep more.

702
00:36:07,076 --> 00:36:09,478
-Ji Hyo. -A little more, a little more.

703
00:36:09,478 --> 00:36:12,214
Ji Hyo seemed like she was dancing the way she was dead in sleep.

704
00:36:14,249 --> 00:36:15,850
Miss Blank.

705
00:36:15,850 --> 00:36:17,519
You're so funny.

706
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:20,922
-Oh. there it is. -Where?

707
00:36:20,922 --> 00:36:22,623
Oh, there it is.

708
00:36:27,194 --> 00:36:28,262
Oh, in front there.

709
00:36:29,463 --> 00:36:31,498
There seems to foe something at the beach.

710
00:36:33,166 --> 00:36:34,401
Hey, it's awesome.

711
00:36:36,169 --> 00:36:37,404
I'm off!

712
00:36:37,404 --> 00:36:38,204
Come get me.

713
00:36:38,204 --> 00:36:39,606
-It's so cool. -Catch me!

714
00:36:42,275 --> 00:36:44,610
I'm the president of Haeundae's sand!

715
00:36:59,224 --> 00:37:00,592
Hey, Gary. Wow.

716
00:37:00,658 --> 00:37:02,260
Wow, the seagulls!

717
00:37:03,394 --> 00:37:05,896
Isn't this, the ideal beach?

718
00:37:11,402 --> 00:37:12,636
Do I put it here?

719
00:37:13,203 --> 00:37:14,304
Oh, they'll be mixed up?

720
00:37:16,006 --> 00:37:18,808
If you pass quickly, you can take it.

721
00:37:18,808 --> 00:37:20,944
What are we doing?

722
00:37:21,444 --> 00:37:22,945
Please give us the mission.

723
00:37:24,113 --> 00:37:25,982
One, two. three. Tada!

724
00:37:29,752 --> 00:37:32,421
The Running Balls that we haven't seen in awhile.

725
00:37:32,421 --> 00:37:34,022
Where do we go?

726
00:37:34,022 --> 00:37:36,792
Can you see the four flags there?

727
00:37:39,761 --> 00:37:46,968
Find the Running Balls with your own names on them and bring them here for passing confirmation.

728
00:37:46,968 --> 00:37:48,836
You can set off together.

729
00:37:56,309 --> 00:37:58,245
Hello!

730
00:37:58,378 --> 00:38:01,414
Lollol!

731
00:38:04,384 --> 00:38:05,752
-Hyung! -This is too...

732
00:38:05,752 --> 00:38:07,320
When can we find them?

733
00:38:07,353 --> 00:38:08,587
Hey, there's something here.

734
00:38:08,621 --> 00:38:11,757
-There seems to be something... -Hyung. There seems to he something here?

735
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,128
What's all this?

736
00:38:16,194 --> 00:38:18,697
-Hey, suck it up. Ji Hyo. -Ah. seriously.

737
00:38:20,765 --> 00:38:22,767
How do we find it here?

738
00:38:22,767 --> 00:38:24,569
How many are there?

739
00:38:24,569 --> 00:38:27,371
How deep are they buried?

740
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:29,006
Are there tools?

741
00:38:32,376 --> 00:38:35,112
-How long wilt it take us to find them? -Where are they?

742
00:38:35,179 --> 00:38:37,714
For your information, they're not buried very deep.

743
00:38:37,814 --> 00:38:38,281
Is that so?

744
00:38:38,315 --> 00:38:40,350
Fhere are about 800 balls here.

745
00:38:40,350 --> 00:38:41,685
800?

746
00:38:41,951 --> 00:38:43,786
What, 800?

747
00:38:43,987 --> 00:38:45,188
800...

748
00:38:45,621 --> 00:38:46,923
This is too...

749
00:38:49,058 --> 00:38:55,030
So many people are watching as if we're having a huge contest going on.

750
00:38:59,034 --> 00:39:00,702
Thank you!

751
00:39:00,702 --> 00:39:02,971
It seems like an international competition here.

752
00:39:07,275 --> 00:39:09,210
-We have to look here... -Oh, oppa.

753
00:39:09,343 --> 00:39:12,980
-Something like this. -Hey, Ji Hyo. You're really like a ghost.

754
00:39:13,113 --> 00:39:15,449
Do we open this?

755
00:39:17,451 --> 00:39:18,552
Oh!

756
00:39:19,252 --> 00:39:19,820
What?

757
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,021
I's not it.

758
00:39:23,556 --> 00:39:24,357
Atgoo.

759
00:39:24,858 --> 00:39:25,458
Hey.

760
00:39:25,491 --> 00:39:26,092
Oh!

761
00:39:26,092 --> 00:39:28,161
-What? -Nothing.

762
00:39:29,595 --> 00:39:30,396
Oh!

763
00:39:30,396 --> 00:39:32,198
-What? -t's not it!

764
00:39:34,533 --> 00:39:38,036
But how do we find this?

765
00:39:38,203 --> 00:39:39,104
Oh!

766
00:39:40,605 --> 00:39:41,706
Lee Da Hae.

767
00:39:41,706 --> 00:39:43,074
Hyung, hide it!

768
00:39:43,074 --> 00:39:44,676
Hide it, oppa.

769
00:39:56,820 --> 00:40:00,424
Hey, the seagulls are here.

770
00:40:03,226 --> 00:40:04,427
Search for it for me!

771
00:40:12,268 --> 00:40:13,602
Lollols...

772
00:40:15,704 --> 00:40:18,607
Search for it! Guys, help us search for it!

773
00:40:19,074 --> 00:40:20,375
Come over here and dig!

774
00:40:20,575 --> 00:40:23,011
Quickly help us dig! Guys!

775
00:40:23,345 --> 00:40:25,513
Quickly help us dig, dig!

776
00:40:26,047 --> 00:40:28,116
Dig, quickly! Dig!

777
00:40:28,683 --> 00:40:33,421
Dig! Yes, that's Tight! Help us look for it!

778
00:40:33,421 --> 00:40:36,190
There's my name, hers, and Gary's!

779
00:40:36,423 --> 00:40:39,092
Look for it wholeheartedly!

780
00:40:40,594 --> 00:40:42,362
Hey Gary, what are you doing?

781
00:40:42,562 --> 00:40:43,997
-Hyung! -Don't you see this splendor?

782
00:40:44,264 --> 00:40:45,165
Hyung! What's happening?

783
00:40:45,465 --> 00:40:46,399
Lol lol!

784
00:40:46,433 --> 00:40:48,801
Why are there so many of them suddenly?

785
00:40:49,802 --> 00:40:52,905
Guys! Quickly dig up the place!

786
00:40:52,905 --> 00:40:55,074
The one who aids me!

787
00:40:56,475 --> 00:40:58,577
The one who aids me!

788
00:41:10,655 --> 00:41:14,158
Ah, it's not like that. I'm asking you to dig the beach...

789
00:41:18,696 --> 00:41:19,430
Oh what's this?

790
00:41:19,463 --> 00:41:21,098
Quickly, hurry up and look for it.

791
00:41:23,033 --> 00:41:24,134
What's going on?

792
00:41:24,201 --> 00:41:25,802
I’m so tired.

793
00:41:25,936 --> 00:41:28,004
Ah. if you found ours, give it to us.

794
00:41:28,004 --> 00:41:28,972
There's nothing, there's nothing.

795
00:41:29,072 --> 00:41:31,074
-We haven't found anything. Really. -Not even one?

796
00:41:31,174 --> 00:41:32,074
Yeah yeah.

797
00:41:32,275 --> 00:41:34,176
Of course we would give it to you if we found them.

798
00:41:42,284 --> 00:41:43,618
Oppa, I found Haha oppa’s.

799
00:41:43,752 --> 00:41:44,419
Where?

800
00:41:49,757 --> 00:41:51,959
Ah why do we always only find theirs?

801
00:41:53,494 --> 00:41:55,796
Let's dig deeper.

802
00:41:57,264 --> 00:41:58,365
Ok ok.

803
00:41:58,399 --> 00:41:59,466
Bury it, bury it.

804
00:42:12,612 --> 00:42:14,113
They're here! Blue Team is here!

805
00:42:15,014 --> 00:42:16,949
It’s so tiring!

806
00:42:18,284 --> 00:42:19,084
What's this?

807
00:42:19,118 --> 00:42:21,420
Looks like we have to find something?

808
00:42:27,559 --> 00:42:28,259
Hyung!

809
00:42:28,293 --> 00:42:28,727
What?

810
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:32,930
-It was like this during my time at FO, too. There's more around the flags -A treasure hunt?

811
00:42:32,930 --> 00:42:33,831
Is that so?

812
00:42:34,232 --> 00:42:35,800
Hmm, Am I right?

813
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:36,734
There, there, there!

814
00:42:36,767 --> 00:42:38,736
There’s too many people here. Go there...

815
00:42:39,703 --> 00:42:40,904
Yah!

816
00:42:41,005 --> 00:42:41,972
Already?

817
00:42:48,845 --> 00:42:50,647
That's impossible!

818
00:42:51,281 --> 00:42:52,682
We just came and we found it!

819
00:42:53,116 --> 00:42:54,183
Gwang Soo!

820
00:43:00,789 --> 00:43:03,358
Hey, he found it in 2 seconds! 2 seconds!

821
00:43:09,397 --> 00:43:09,998
Oh!

822
00:43:12,767 --> 00:43:14,168
Ji Hyo!

823
00:43:16,170 --> 00:43:17,204
Quickly, quickly!

824
00:43:17,204 --> 00:43:18,506
Wait, wait!

825
00:43:18,572 --> 00:43:19,974
Da Hae's, it's Da Hae's again!

826
00:43:19,974 --> 00:43:22,910
Why do we keep finding other people's?

827
00:43:23,077 --> 00:43:25,646
Oppa, I buried someone else’s again!

828
00:43:25,712 --> 00:43:26,613
You did?

829
00:43:30,216 --> 00:43:31,951
Hahahaha.

830
00:43:39,892 --> 00:43:40,893
Hello.

831
00:43:41,227 --> 00:43:43,662
You guys be more serious in-your search!

832
00:43:46,598 --> 00:43:48,200
- Ah. what's this? - Ah!

833
00:43:52,704 --> 00:43:56,974
You want a piece of me?

834
00:44:20,629 --> 00:44:22,598
Oppa! He found it!

835
00:44:24,767 --> 00:44:26,068
I found Lee Da Hae's!

836
00:44:29,271 --> 00:44:30,805
Ah, this is really.

837
00:44:36,044 --> 00:44:36,544
Yah!

838
00:44:36,544 --> 00:44:38,446
Is there really something here?

839
00:44:39,013 --> 00:44:40,381
Is there really?

840
00:44:50,857 --> 00:44:53,093
- And what are you doing? - Why are you poking your nose into this?

841
00:44:54,928 --> 00:44:56,596
The game isn't over yet!

842
00:44:56,596 --> 00:44:58,164
Get lost!

843
00:44:58,331 --> 00:45:00,766
Because of you, nothing goes right.

844
00:45:00,866 --> 00:45:01,767
You too!

845
00:45:02,067 --> 00:45:03,903
The one who irks me!

846
00:45:05,504 --> 00:45:06,105
Scram!

847
00:45:06,405 --> 00:45:08,507
The one who has an incomprehensible face!

848
00:45:09,274 --> 00:45:10,375
Hey!

849
00:45:11,476 --> 00:45:14,245
Scram! It was all because of you!

850
00:45:14,779 --> 00:45:19,283
Oh, but then again, it is fortunate that all of you are laughing so happily.

851
00:45:19,283 --> 00:45:22,753
It seems like digging in the sand is funny? It's not too bad?

852
00:45:22,753 --> 00:45:24,054
Yes-

853
00:45:25,723 --> 00:45:28,525
Digging in the sand seems OK. Seeing how everyone is enjoying it.

854
00:45:32,662 --> 00:45:33,830
Say Ho-Oh!

855
00:45:33,963 --> 00:45:35,331
Ho-Oh-

856
00:45:39,035 --> 00:45:40,803
I love you, Busan.

857
00:45:53,515 --> 00:45:57,385
Whoo.

858
00:45:57,685 --> 00:45:58,953
Let's make a wave!

859
00:46:07,494 --> 00:46:09,429
Thank you everyone! I will definitely win!

860
00:46:10,163 --> 00:46:11,498
I will work hard!

861
00:46:17,303 --> 00:46:18,004
Hey!

862
00:46:28,113 --> 00:46:29,882
Hey, you need to work!

863
00:46:36,688 --> 00:46:38,122
I found it!

864
00:46:38,256 --> 00:46:40,391
Whose? Whose? WHOSE?

865
00:46:40,525 --> 00:46:41,759
I found it!

866
00:46:41,826 --> 00:46:43,127
- Whose is that? - Yoo Jae Suk's.

867
00:46:43,127 --> 00:46:44,729
Found Yoo Jae Suk's running ball!

868
00:46:45,963 --> 00:46:46,397
Ya!

869
00:46:46,530 --> 00:46:47,364
Found it!

870
00:46:47,564 --> 00:46:49,700
Why do I keep finding others'?

871
00:46:51,535 --> 00:46:53,403
Where are these balls?

872
00:46:57,574 --> 00:47:00,176
They seemed like they were buried quite deeply?

873
00:47:03,079 --> 00:47:04,347
Hohohohoho

874
00:47:04,547 --> 00:47:05,781
I found it!

875
00:47:07,016 --> 00:47:10,953
- Gary! Gary! Gary! - Looks like they found it?

876
00:47:11,553 --> 00:47:13,955
Gary! Gary!

877
00:47:14,089 --> 00:47:16,091
Yours is the only one left.

878
00:47:16,224 --> 00:47:17,359
We are left with Ji Hyo's.

879
00:47:21,963 --> 00:47:25,032
Ya, Gwang Soo! There's nothing even if you dig deeper.

880
00:47:25,499 --> 00:47:27,468
There's sea water sprouting out here.

881
00:47:30,204 --> 00:47:32,706
Ah, there's nothing here! What should we do?

882
00:47:34,374 --> 00:47:35,876
What should we do now?

883
00:47:36,276 --> 00:47:37,911
Ya, all we have to do is to find Song Ji Hyo's!

884
00:47:39,412 --> 00:47:41,681
Ah Da Hae's! It's Da? Hae's again!

885
00:47:43,616 --> 00:47:44,550
I found Kim Jong Kook's!

886
00:47:47,153 --> 00:47:48,087
We found it!

887
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:49,188
We found it!

888
00:47:52,891 --> 00:47:54,493
Oppa!

889
00:47:54,593 --> 00:47:55,794
Yes! we’re done!

890
00:47:56,127 --> 00:47:56,895
Where?

891
00:47:57,662 --> 00:47:59,097
Lee Gwang Soo! Lee Gwang Soo!

892
00:48:01,432 --> 00:48:02,767
That team seems like they are done?

893
00:48:03,134 --> 00:48:04,035
Ji Hyo.

894
00:48:06,170 --> 00:48:07,304
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

895
00:48:09,873 --> 00:48:14,911
- Ah, it's Lee Da Hae again! Lee Da Hae! - Ah. why are you treating me like this?

896
00:48:17,147 --> 00:48:19,549
Let me verify the running balls. Please hold the ones with your names.

897
00:48:19,949 --> 00:48:21,150
Song Ji Hyo. Gary.

898
00:48:21,484 --> 00:48:22,652
Thank you!

899
00:48:24,087 --> 00:48:26,689
All right, please choose 3 of these.

900
00:48:27,056 --> 00:48:28,057
If you pick it up, it's over.

901
00:48:28,057 --> 00:48:32,094
Oh but, please tell us if the bundles are in their original places.

902
00:48:32,327 --> 00:48:33,462
You can at least tell us this, right?

903
00:48:33,495 --> 00:48:34,329
I really don't know.

904
00:48:34,363 --> 00:48:35,364
You really don't know?

905
00:48:35,397 --> 00:48:37,365
Hyung, there're 3 here.

906
00:48:37,365 --> 00:48:39,034
- Let's pick these 2. - Yes, that's right. That's right.

907
00:48:44,872 --> 00:48:46,207
These 2,

908
00:48:46,807 --> 00:48:47,875
And then...

909
00:48:48,476 --> 00:48:50,010
Hyung, let's choose the last one over there.

910
00:48:50,377 --> 00:48:51,078
Ok!

911
00:48:53,313 --> 00:48:55,983
Go to Nurimaru APEC House and look for the Running Man banner. Let's go.

912
00:48:59,019 --> 00:49:00,687
We just need to find Ji Suk hyung's.

913
00:49:01,788 --> 00:49:03,456
How can there be nothing? Not even one?

914
00:49:05,825 --> 00:49:06,759
Oh Ji Ho.

915
00:49:07,093 --> 00:49:09,562
Ah, Oh Ji Ho, deeper, in deeper!

916
00:49:10,696 --> 00:49:12,665
Hey, they should know where the balls are right?

917
00:49:15,567 --> 00:49:16,601
Cm going crazy!

918
00:49:16,735 --> 00:49:18,270
I'm going crazy! Really!

919
00:49:18,403 --> 00:49:19,904
I'm going crazy!

920
00:49:22,407 --> 00:49:26,511
I found it! Oh Ji Ho! Oh Ji Ho found! Oh Ji Ho!

921
00:49:26,644 --> 00:49:27,678
Oppa, here!

922
00:49:28,346 --> 00:49:29,513
Yoo Jae Suk! Yoo Jae Suk!

923
00:49:30,181 --> 00:49:32,449
Ah where is Suk Jin hyung's ball? I don't see it anywhere!

924
00:49:33,384 --> 00:49:35,485
Song Ji Hyo.

925
00:49:36,953 --> 00:49:38,922
Ji Suk Jin!

926
00:49:39,956 --> 00:49:41,391
Ah, what's this?

927
00:49:41,424 --> 00:49:42,025
Let's go!

928
00:49:42,025 --> 00:49:43,259
Ah, oppa!

929
00:49:43,359 --> 00:49:45,128
Only oppa's is left!

930
00:49:45,161 --> 00:49:46,629
Did you really put in mine?

931
00:49:46,662 --> 00:49:48,431
Ah, I'm really going crazy.

932
00:49:49,198 --> 00:49:50,666
Ah, what's wrong with us today?

933
00:49:52,768 --> 00:49:54,002
Haha! I found it!

934
00:49:54,036 --> 00:49:55,270
Oh you found it? Found?

935
00:49:58,974 --> 00:50:01,209
Oppa, open the bundles and check the contents first.

936
00:50:02,110 --> 00:50:03,711
This isn't it, this isn't it.

937
00:50:03,711 --> 00:50:05,280
It's one of those two. obviously.

938
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:07,115
- Oh. it's not this one. - Ji Hyo, it's not?

939
00:50:07,115 --> 00:50:08,583
It's not?

940
00:50:08,716 --> 00:50:10,885
Looks like they got mixed up.

941
00:50:11,285 --> 00:50:12,987
- It's really not there? -Oh!

942
00:50:13,087 --> 00:50:16,123
- It's here. wow. - Ah. it's there.

943
00:50:17,090 --> 00:50:18,825
- It's here. - It‘s really there.

944
00:50:19,359 --> 00:50:22,128
-We did it. -Daebak. Daebak.

945
00:50:22,595 --> 00:50:23,530
Wow.

946
00:50:23,630 --> 00:50:26,599
Aigoo, digging around was worthwhile.

947
00:50:26,666 --> 00:50:27,500
Exactly.

948
00:50:27,934 --> 00:50:32,304
If we can keep it well at the final venue, we can win today.

949
00:50:35,307 --> 00:50:37,109
Gary. I'm grateful to you.

950
00:50:37,576 --> 00:50:38,176
It's not it?

951
00:50:38,176 --> 00:50:39,011
This isn't it.

952
00:50:39,144 --> 00:50:41,179
I didn't tie it up like that.

953
00:50:42,981 --> 00:50:44,516
- This one is not too? - Yeah, they're all not.

954
00:50:45,083 --> 00:50:47,752
The one who has the real bundle.

955
00:50:48,086 --> 00:50:49,420
Jae Suk has it.

956
00:50:51,255 --> 00:50:55,192
- We have those marked with lip gloss earlier. - They're all here.

957
00:50:55,192 --> 00:50:57,694
Just like it was.

958
00:50:58,028 --> 00:50:59,596
It shouldn't be with Jong Kook oppa's team.

959
00:50:59,696 --> 00:51:03,633
Jong Kook said earlier that theirs has no mark.

960
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,336
That's why, it's with Jae Suk oppa.

961
00:51:20,749 --> 00:51:21,883
We're here!

962
00:51:22,317 --> 00:51:25,086
Get the bundle, the bundle.

963
00:51:27,255 --> 00:51:29,657
That's the real one, I made three folds.

964
00:51:30,424 --> 00:51:33,861
In this venue. you will carry out the final mission for one hour.

965
00:51:33,861 --> 00:51:34,628
Ok.

966
00:51:34,628 --> 00:51:38,098
After precisely one hour, the time will stop.

967
00:51:38,098 --> 00:51:40,534
The team possessing the real bundle will win.

968
00:51:40,534 --> 00:51:45,071
- But, there are a tiger and a lion on the other team - The other sides are too strong.

969
00:51:45,805 --> 00:51:48,308
So you have to take advantage of the early arriver and hide well.

970
00:51:48,308 --> 00:51:50,710
Use any method to protect it for an hour,

971
00:51:50,877 --> 00:51:53,446
- Gary, you take care of the sack. - No, hyung.

972
00:51:53,612 --> 00:51:55,848
- Jl Hyo, take it. - Oppa, let's go in first.

973
00:51:55,915 --> 00:51:58,083
Really sorry, I have no confidence.

974
00:51:58,117 --> 00:52:01,687
- Jl Ho is weak in front of women. - Let's just go in first.

975
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:03,622
Ji Hyo. we trust you,

976
00:52:03,855 --> 00:52:06,257
Gary, let's go up.

977
00:52:09,394 --> 00:52:13,464
We have to check out the passageways and all.

978
00:52:14,632 --> 00:52:16,600
It's really cool.

979
00:52:23,473 --> 00:52:26,876
The one hour has started since the first team entered.

980
00:52:27,110 --> 00:52:30,313
If your nametag's torn off then they can take ft from you,

981
00:52:30,413 --> 00:52:31,647
Let's do it.

982
00:52:31,948 --> 00:52:33,082
Kook!

983
00:52:33,082 --> 00:52:33,716
Feel!

984
00:52:33,716 --> 00:52:34,383
Touch!

985
00:52:34,383 --> 00:52:35,317
- Cross! - We have to do well.

986
00:52:35,684 --> 00:52:36,919
Ok. let's go.

987
00:52:40,422 --> 00:52:43,658
Nametags? Right. It's time to use my strength.

988
00:52:50,198 --> 00:52:52,800
Should we snatch it from the second team?

989
00:52:52,834 --> 00:52:57,404
Even if we snatched it. only one team will be left.

990
00:52:57,605 --> 00:52:59,673
I think it's with Ji Hyo.

991
00:52:59,673 --> 00:53:02,209
Ji Ho oppa will take care of Ji Hyo eonnie.

992
00:53:02,209 --> 00:53:03,744
I'll take care of her.

993
00:53:05,412 --> 00:53:06,780
Oh, hello.

994
00:53:06,846 --> 00:53:08,114
Aigoo.

995
00:53:08,381 --> 00:53:09,582
Do you want to swap?

996
00:53:09,649 --> 00:53:12,452
- Huh? No. You can swap with me. - Let's swap, let's swap.

997
00:53:12,718 --> 00:53:13,886
Let's swap.

998
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:16,555
Let's swap, let's swap. Aigoo, nice to meet you.

999
00:53:16,922 --> 00:53:18,424
Ok, this will do.

1000
00:53:19,058 --> 00:53:21,193
Okay, let's put them all down.

1001
00:53:21,226 --> 00:53:23,262
Ok, let's shout 'fighting'.

1002
00:53:23,795 --> 00:53:29,534
Blossoming flower in Dongbaekseom.

1003
00:53:29,534 --> 00:53:31,169
The target is Yoo Jae Suk!

1004
00:53:31,236 --> 00:53:32,770
-It's definitely with that team. -Yes.

1005
00:53:32,904 --> 00:53:34,272
-Definitely with that team. - First, let's...

1006
00:53:34,272 --> 00:53:36,273
Let's ally, let's ally.

1007
00:53:36,674 --> 00:53:40,778
-So what should we do? -We have little time so we have to hunt them.

1008
00:53:41,078 --> 00:53:42,479
Hyung, Our hyung!

1009
00:53:42,513 --> 00:53:43,113
That's right.

1010
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:45,482
Hyung, you know we only have one hour right?

1011
00:53:45,615 --> 00:53:47,484
-We have to hurry. -We STILL have one hour.

1012
00:53:47,717 --> 00:53:48,718
Let's go, let go,

1013
00:53:48,752 --> 00:53:51,087
-Hyung is so positive. -It's 6 vs 3,

1014
00:53:51,821 --> 00:53:53,156
Where are you?

1015
00:53:54,590 --> 00:53:57,293
You better hurry off and escape.

1016
00:54:01,230 --> 00:54:02,898
They're all here, all of them are here.

1017
00:54:04,666 --> 00:54:06,401
Hurry, hurry.

1018
00:54:07,536 --> 00:54:10,472
Hey. let's get out. The elevator, the elevator.

1019
00:54:10,772 --> 00:54:12,373
How long do we have to escape for?

1020
00:54:12,407 --> 00:54:13,508
Hang on.

1021
00:54:20,914 --> 00:54:25,385
Do we really have to do this with such a beautiful background?

1022
00:54:26,553 --> 00:54:28,021
Hang on. firstly...

1023
00:54:29,122 --> 00:54:31,391
With this situation, we have to keep moving.

1024
00:54:31,524 --> 00:54:35,461
But hyung, everyone now knows that our bundle is the real one.

1025
00:54:35,495 --> 00:54:36,529
Right, of course.

1026
00:54:38,564 --> 00:54:41,233
It would feel better to have mine torn off,

1027
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:43,268
-I'm seriously going crazy. -Why did we pick the real one?

1028
00:54:43,268 --> 00:54:44,636
Hey, can we swap?

1029
00:54:45,270 --> 00:54:47,706
Oppa, you know this will make you a clear target, right?

1030
00:54:47,706 --> 00:54:48,507
I know.

1031
00:54:52,544 --> 00:54:56,447
Why can't I tell lies properly?

1032
00:54:58,082 --> 00:55:02,319
We can't lie either, we'will act strangely if we do.

1033
00:55:02,319 --> 00:55:03,987
Ji Ho, Ji Ho.

1034
00:55:08,425 --> 00:55:10,327
Here, here.

1035
00:55:10,393 --> 00:55:12,796
They're here. Hurry, hurry. They're here.

1036
00:55:17,733 --> 00:55:19,535
Jae Suk hyung.

1037
00:55:24,907 --> 00:55:26,908
We have to keep moving now.

1038
00:55:27,309 --> 00:55:30,779
Oppa. I will really lose weight like this.

1039
00:55:31,246 --> 00:55:33,314
How about taking the stairwell?

1040
00:55:33,314 --> 00:55:34,616
Right, right.

1041
00:55:41,088 --> 00:55:45,025
It should be the one being grabbed tightly like this.

1042
00:55:45,793 --> 00:55:47,694
The person who holds it tightly.

1043
00:55:49,930 --> 00:55:52,265
Ji Hyo was grabbing it tightly like this.

1044
00:55:53,099 --> 00:55:55,134
It may be swapped by now,

1045
00:56:07,145 --> 00:56:12,117
Hang on! Hyung! Hang on!

1046
00:56:14,319 --> 00:56:15,453
Jong Kook hyung!

1047
00:56:16,154 --> 00:56:17,288
Jong Kook hyung!

1048
00:56:18,823 --> 00:56:20,424
Jong Kook hyung!

1049
00:56:23,727 --> 00:56:25,963
-Hyung, Ji Ho hyung tried to tear mine off! -What?

1050
00:56:25,963 --> 00:56:28,432
-What did you say? -Ji Ho hyung tried to tear mine off!

1051
00:56:32,102 --> 00:56:33,903
We're screwed!

1052
00:56:34,404 --> 00:56:36,306
-Why did you do that? -Hyung!

1053
00:56:36,306 --> 00:56:39,575
No, that's not what I meant.

1054
00:56:39,575 --> 00:56:41,177
-Hyung. -Come here.

1055
00:56:41,744 --> 00:56:42,945
Hey, come here.

1056
00:56:43,579 --> 00:56:44,780
It's over!

1057
00:56:44,813 --> 00:56:46,348
That's not what I meant,

1058
00:56:46,515 --> 00:56:50,218
-I was behind him and I suddenly felt like tearing it. -Ji Ho! You can't do that!

1059
00:56:50,485 --> 00:56:52,587
That's not what I meant to do.

1060
00:56:53,021 --> 00:56:54,356
Hey, you can't do that,

1061
00:56:55,023 --> 00:56:57,258
-I have never torn one before. -So, you're practising?

1062
00:56:57,292 --> 00:56:59,393
-So, you're practising? -I was practising...

1063
00:56:59,460 --> 00:57:01,429
What kind of practice is that?!

1064
00:57:02,129 --> 00:57:04,365
Think of the person involved!

1065
00:57:06,467 --> 00:57:07,668
You shouldn't do that.

1066
00:57:07,701 --> 00:57:10,003
That's why I just tore half,

1067
00:57:10,304 --> 00:57:12,372
-That's why I only tore half. -Ah, is that so? - Right.

1068
00:57:12,906 --> 00:57:17,143
Hey, also, although we’re in an alliance, don't be too at ease.

1069
00:57:17,210 --> 00:57:22,048
I was together with Da Hae noona and Ji Ho hyung.

1070
00:57:27,786 --> 00:57:29,488
Oh, it shocked me.

1071
00:57:36,094 --> 00:57:37,629
Come this way.

1072
00:57:42,366 --> 00:57:43,834
Hide yourself there.

1073
00:57:45,870 --> 00:57:47,671
Can this hide a person?

1074
00:58:01,551 --> 00:58:03,286
There's no one,

1075
00:58:03,286 --> 00:58:05,921
-I don't think there’s anyone here. -There's no one here.

1076
00:58:05,921 --> 00:58:08,090
We have to spread out.

1077
00:58:08,624 --> 00:58:10,192
Is there an emergency exit?

1078
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:13,728
Could they be upstairs?

1079
00:58:17,499 --> 00:58:19,500
There, over there!

1080
00:58:23,304 --> 00:58:24,572
Hurry, hurry,

1081
00:58:27,107 --> 00:58:29,910
-They went outside. -Over there. Outside, outside.

1082
00:58:30,077 --> 00:58:32,479
We have to tear theirs off, there's no time.

1083
00:58:32,913 --> 00:58:33,780
Let's finish this,

1084
00:58:36,049 --> 00:58:41,387
-The mission ends in thirty minutes, the mission ends in thirty minutes -Only thirty minutes?

1085
00:58:49,261 --> 00:58:50,129
30 minutes?

1086
00:58:50,429 --> 00:58:53,398
Ah, this won't do. I'm going crazy.

1087
00:59:17,954 --> 00:59:19,022
Get in.

1088
00:59:19,089 --> 00:59:20,623
Go in, go in, they're coming here.

1089
00:59:20,657 --> 00:59:22,859
They're coming. Hurry,

1090
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:25,394
That door's not locked.

1091
00:59:25,661 --> 00:59:27,596
Ah, I'm seriously going crazy.

1092
00:59:29,331 --> 00:59:31,166
They're near, they're around here.

1093
00:59:31,533 --> 00:59:32,801
They're definitely here.

1094
00:59:35,270 --> 00:59:36,471
The back, the back.

1095
00:59:49,950 --> 00:59:52,419
So you were here.

1096
00:59:52,419 --> 00:59:54,254
I almost couldn't find you, hyung.

1097
00:59:55,822 --> 00:59:56,957
Ah, really.

1098
00:59:56,957 --> 00:59:58,692
Ji Ho, really...

1099
01:00:00,660 --> 01:00:02,929
We will go out first, Ji Ho.

1100
01:00:04,297 --> 01:00:05,531
Let's go together, hyung.

1101
01:00:06,265 --> 01:00:08,134
I know I know, come in.

1102
01:00:10,603 --> 01:00:11,971
Hey. hey. hey, hey!

1103
01:00:15,974 --> 01:00:19,711
They are here!! They are here!! Second floor!

1104
01:00:25,783 --> 01:00:27,885
Wait, this is the jail.

1105
01:00:29,353 --> 01:00:30,454
Why did you come in?

1106
01:00:30,521 --> 01:00:33,957
This is the jail, so let's go out.

1107
01:00:34,791 --> 01:00:36,393
Hyung, first let's change bundles.

1108
01:00:36,693 --> 01:00:38,495
No. this is not the one.

1109
01:00:38,695 --> 01:00:39,896
No, this... I can’t!

1110
01:00:39,930 --> 01:00:41,898
Ah, this is really not the one.

1111
01:00:41,898 --> 01:00:42,832
Can't you change this?

1112
01:00:42,866 --> 01:00:45,935
-Why can't you change? -I can't change this, I can't change this,

1113
01:00:46,335 --> 01:00:53,008
I'm suggesting that, in exchange for not eliminating them, that we exchange bundles,

1114
01:00:53,075 --> 01:00:55,010
-Hyung, this suggestion is not bad. -Lets go out first before talking.

1115
01:00:55,144 --> 01:00:58,280
-Let's go out first, this is the jail. -Let's go out first, this is the jail.

1116
01:00:59,447 --> 01:01:00,849
-You go out first. -You go out first.

1117
01:01:00,915 --> 01:01:01,483
You go out first.

1118
01:01:01,483 --> 01:01:03,084
-You go out first. - Let's play scissors paper stone to decide.

1119
01:01:04,052 --> 01:01:04,852
Scissors, paper, stone.

1120
01:01:04,953 --> 01:01:07,121
I won. Please go out first.

1121
01:01:08,356 --> 01:01:09,590
-Scissors, paper, stone. -You!

1122
01:01:13,494 --> 01:01:16,830
-I am just using this method of scaring him. -Hyung! Didn't I say not to leave my side even for a moment!

1123
01:01:17,164 --> 01:01:17,798
Come quickly.

1124
01:01:17,998 --> 01:01:19,166
Go out.

1125
01:01:25,805 --> 01:01:29,175
Hey there! We won’t tear your name tags, just give us 1 bundle.

1126
01:01:29,275 --> 01:01:31,277
Just give us one.

1127
01:01:31,444 --> 01:01:32,645
Give me Song Ji Hyo’s bundle. Song Ji Hyo's!

1128
01:01:32,711 --> 01:01:35,381
-No... - No, if we just leave like this, wouldn't it be too cowardly?

1129
01:01:37,516 --> 01:01:39,217
-Then take mine, -Okay, whichever.

1130
01:01:39,651 --> 01:01:41,786
Whichever one is fine. Just give it to us.

1131
01:01:41,786 --> 01:01:43,521
-Then take mine. -Okay, whichever,

1132
01:01:44,889 --> 01:01:46,891
-Give it to me, Give it to me! -No, no...

1133
01:01:47,625 --> 01:01:48,693
Give it to me!

1134
01:01:48,726 --> 01:01:49,961
Just any one.

1135
01:01:50,361 --> 01:01:50,928
Give me one.

1136
01:01:50,995 --> 01:01:52,663
Wait, oppa. wait...

1137
01:01:54,565 --> 01:01:56,233
Right now, you're attacking, right?

1138
01:02:09,912 --> 01:02:12,648
-I'll give mine. -Ok, let's do this.

1139
01:02:12,848 --> 01:02:13,949
-Give it to me! -No, no...

1140
01:02:14,049 --> 01:02:15,250
Give it to me!

1141
01:02:22,557 --> 01:02:24,893
-Just give it to me. Give me! -No, no...

1142
01:02:24,926 --> 01:02:25,860
Give it to me!

1143
01:02:26,394 --> 01:02:28,663
Give me one.

1144
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:34,902
Right now, you're attacking, right?

1145
01:02:36,804 --> 01:02:37,371
Oh!

1146
01:02:45,245 --> 01:02:45,979
It's Haha!

1147
01:03:18,175 --> 01:03:18,976
Hyung!

1148
01:03:19,610 --> 01:03:21,144
What did you do?

1149
01:03:22,212 --> 01:03:24,147
We had to have Jong Kook hyung eliminated.

1150
01:03:24,347 --> 01:03:25,582
We have to eliminate the strong ones first!

1151
01:03:25,615 --> 01:03:26,783
You did well.

1152
01:03:32,188 --> 01:03:35,825
Kim Jong Koofi, out' Kim Jong Kook, out!

1153
01:03:51,072 --> 01:03:52,707
Oppa, lets eliminate Haha.

1154
01:03:52,874 --> 01:03:53,474
Ok.

1155
01:03:57,244 --> 01:03:58,812
Da Hae is behind us.

1156
01:04:02,549 --> 01:04:04,484
Because she follows so quietly.

1157
01:04:05,318 --> 01:04:06,586
Hold on. Ji Hyo, Ji Hyo.

1158
01:04:09,422 --> 01:04:11,124
-Hey, they're here! -Hey! We...

1159
01:04:16,429 --> 01:04:18,631
Catch him, catch him!

1160
01:04:18,764 --> 01:04:19,365
Oppa!

1161
01:04:20,399 --> 01:04:21,767
Looks like it's the one Ji Hyo is holding!

1162
01:04:23,268 --> 01:04:23,802
Catch her, catch her!

1163
01:04:23,835 --> 01:04:26,304
Quickly catch her, now!

1164
01:04:41,552 --> 01:04:42,286
It's done.

1165
01:04:44,454 --> 01:04:45,589
Why is it me?

1166
01:04:49,025 --> 01:04:50,260
You're grateful, aren't you?

1167
01:04:50,260 --> 01:04:52,395
Do you want to win?

1168
01:04:52,495 --> 01:04:52,995
Thank you.

1169
01:04:53,062 --> 01:04:56,532
Ji Ho. there's not much time left, we have to start attacking.

1170
01:04:57,133 --> 01:04:58,300
There's no time, there's no time!

1171
01:04:58,367 --> 01:05:00,269
Da Hae, don't smile so much.

1172
01:05:02,804 --> 01:05:04,373
What do we do?

1173
01:05:04,973 --> 01:05:06,475
Where are you going?

1174
01:05:20,287 --> 01:05:22,122
Haha is following me here.

1175
01:05:22,256 --> 01:05:23,457
So be quiet.

1176
01:05:23,891 --> 01:05:25,425
Go film from over there!

1177
01:05:42,074 --> 01:05:43,475
Hey! Da Hae!

1178
01:05:44,076 --> 01:05:45,043
Ahh!

1179
01:05:46,878 --> 01:05:49,381
Hey! Da Hae! Da Hae!

1180
01:05:53,918 --> 01:05:55,620
Hyung, isn't Haha in danger?

1181
01:05:56,387 --> 01:05:59,156
-He seem to be shouting. -No, ,. There are two people.

1182
01:06:04,828 --> 01:06:05,696
Da Hae!

1183
01:06:06,663 --> 01:06:07,831
Da Hae!

1184
01:06:16,706 --> 01:06:20,376
Haha. out.1 Haha. out!

1185
01:06:20,376 --> 01:06:21,944
Awesome!! Awesome!!

1186
01:06:21,977 --> 01:06:22,411
Why?

1187
01:06:22,411 --> 01:06:24,880
-Haha is out. -Doesn't matter, even if he is out...

1188
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:26,381
It's mine!

1189
01:06:26,481 --> 01:06:27,449
It's mine!

1190
01:06:27,916 --> 01:06:28,950
Ah. you're out, too!

1191
01:06:29,117 --> 01:06:30,185
Ah. you're out, too!

1192
01:06:50,103 --> 01:06:51,104
Hello.

1193
01:06:52,072 --> 01:06:53,973
Hyung! Are you doing fine, hyung!

1194
01:06:55,008 --> 01:06:56,275
How are you hyung!

1195
01:06:57,176 --> 01:06:59,078
I need to make a trip to the toilet.

1196
01:06:59,278 --> 01:07:01,313
Ah, it's so hot.

1197
01:07:04,550 --> 01:07:06,785
Oh, so this is the jail.

1198
01:07:07,653 --> 01:07:08,954
Ah, I feel calm.

1199
01:07:17,495 --> 01:07:18,996
I was wrong, hyung!

1200
01:07:23,067 --> 01:07:26,003
Sometimes you are possessed by other people?

1201
01:07:28,372 --> 01:07:29,706
I'd rather you say that.

1202
01:07:29,773 --> 01:07:32,409
Just so long as you let me believe in you.

1203
01:07:32,976 --> 01:07:35,378
Gwang Soo, you kneel down too.

1204
01:07:36,179 --> 01:07:38,214
You too! You are also like that.

1205
01:07:38,281 --> 01:07:39,348
Do you want to be Hit?

1206
01:07:43,853 --> 01:07:45,254
He is also possessed, Hyung!

1207
01:07:46,822 --> 01:07:48,557
What's the matter?

1208
01:07:49,358 --> 01:07:51,026
He, too, gets possessed!

1209
01:07:51,226 --> 01:07:52,994
How does he do this?

1210
01:08:04,605 --> 01:08:05,406
Hyung!

1211
01:08:06,006 --> 01:08:07,374
Oppa. awesome!

1212
01:08:08,308 --> 01:08:09,910
Oppa. what happened?

1213
01:08:10,243 --> 01:08:11,912
Oppa. how did you do it?

1214
01:08:11,945 --> 01:08:13,079
Oppa!

1215
01:08:13,813 --> 01:08:15,782
I set a trap... A trap...

1216
01:08:16,015 --> 01:08:16,416
Who?

1217
01:08:16,416 --> 01:08:17,584
I almost died.

1218
01:08:17,684 --> 01:08:19,919
I set a trap... Haha followed me in first...

1219
01:08:20,486 --> 01:08:22,855
HaHa saw me and followed.

1220
01:08:24,156 --> 01:08:25,524
I used all my energy

1221
01:08:25,524 --> 01:08:26,825
I eliminated HaHa, but.

1222
01:08:26,825 --> 01:08:28,093
Da Hae also came in.

1223
01:08:28,794 --> 01:08:30,462
As HaHa left, 1 closed the door.

1224
01:08:30,762 --> 01:08:32,864
So I ripped off Da Hae's tag as well.

1225
01:08:32,931 --> 01:08:35,200
But I'm now confused. Whose bundle is real?

1226
01:08:35,233 --> 01:08:37,001
I can't tell anymore.

1227
01:08:37,635 --> 01:08:39,303
I was holding it, but I don’t think I am now.

1228
01:08:39,404 --> 01:08:42,406
It's either mine or Gary's,

1229
01:08:42,607 --> 01:08:43,574
It seem like it's Ji Hyo's.

1230
01:08:43,607 --> 01:08:44,675
- Let's see. - Ji Hyo's, Ji Hyo's.

1231
01:08:44,975 --> 01:08:46,010
There is, there is.

1232
01:08:46,043 --> 01:08:47,778
It's Ji Hyo's,

1233
01:08:49,346 --> 01:08:50,781
Oh! It's Suk Jin hyung.

1234
01:08:52,516 --> 01:08:54,084
Hyung! Come here for a moment!

1235
01:08:54,284 --> 01:08:56,953
Say we'll give him his present.

1236
01:08:57,053 --> 01:08:57,954
Oppa!

1237
01:08:58,855 --> 01:08:59,555
Come over here!

1238
01:08:59,622 --> 01:09:00,990
Hyung! Come here for a moment!

1239
01:09:00,990 --> 01:09:02,458
Hyung, how are you going to do this alone?

1240
01:09:03,125 --> 01:09:04,927
Hey, do you think I have only been tricked once or twice?

1241
01:09:05,194 --> 01:09:06,061
It’s real!

1242
01:09:06,195 --> 01:09:07,963
Hyung! Come over here!

1243
01:09:08,130 --> 01:09:09,665
We have something to give you.

1244
01:09:09,665 --> 01:09:10,399
What?

1245
01:09:11,533 --> 01:09:13,502
We must spread the trap now.

1246
01:09:13,635 --> 01:09:14,202
Huh?

1247
01:09:14,269 --> 01:09:15,403
We're spreading the trap.

1248
01:09:16,971 --> 01:09:19,474
Hyung! Hyung, what present did you choose?

1249
01:09:19,974 --> 01:09:20,675
-Me? -Yes,

1250
01:09:20,708 --> 01:09:21,709
- Computer. - Eh?

1251
01:09:21,709 --> 01:09:22,110
Computer.

1252
01:09:22,110 --> 01:09:23,578
We will give that to you hyung, will it do?

1253
01:09:23,711 --> 01:09:24,812
- Do you give me your word? - Yes.

1254
01:09:24,845 --> 01:09:25,746
Really.

1255
01:09:25,880 --> 01:09:27,915
We already have a computer, at home.

1256
01:09:29,516 --> 01:09:30,517
So, it's like this?

1257
01:09:30,584 --> 01:09:31,919
Then it’ll be like this?

1258
01:09:32,185 --> 01:09:34,121
After we eliminate Ji Ho, then...

1259
01:09:35,355 --> 01:09:36,189
That's right!

1260
01:09:36,289 --> 01:09:38,458
After that then tear my tag off, at the end...

1261
01:09:38,525 --> 01:09:39,692
We just have to give you the computer, hyung.

1262
01:09:39,759 --> 01:09:40,693
Of course.

1263
01:09:51,403 --> 01:09:53,071
Jae Suk hyung is still alive?

1264
01:09:53,405 --> 01:09:54,506
He's still alive?

1265
01:09:54,806 --> 01:09:56,208
He wasn't eliminated?

1266
01:09:56,374 --> 01:09:58,476
So he ripped off both their name tags?

1267
01:10:01,579 --> 01:10:02,547
Really.

1268
01:10:02,747 --> 01:10:05,016
- Hyung, we will be here. - All right.

1269
01:10:05,149 --> 01:10:06,951
You'll be here? You want me to eliminate him and come back?!

1270
01:10:06,984 --> 01:10:08,852
- Of course. - What?!

1271
01:10:12,322 --> 01:10:13,523
Hyung, you were still alive?

1272
01:10:14,157 --> 01:10:15,058
Who? Jae Suk?

1273
01:10:15,125 --> 01:10:16,927
Yes, I survived.

1274
01:10:17,360 --> 01:10:19,195
3 vs 2 is very disadvantageous.

1275
01:10:19,996 --> 01:10:21,698
3 vs 2 is disadvantageous.

1276
01:10:22,598 --> 01:10:26,502
But Ji Ho, though 3 vs 2 is disadvantageous, it is 4 vs 1 now.

1277
01:10:38,580 --> 01:10:41,382
There is not much time left, it is about time to see the ending.

1278
01:10:43,284 --> 01:10:44,919
Really, just now.

1279
01:10:45,486 --> 01:10:47,555
- There are stairs behind. - I got it.

1280
01:11:03,069 --> 01:11:04,404
Oh, Suk Jin hyung.

1281
01:11:04,904 --> 01:11:05,805
Oh, Suk Jin hyung.

1282
01:11:05,905 --> 01:11:07,773
In this case the alliance is broken.

1283
01:11:12,611 --> 01:11:14,046
Turn, hyung, turn!

1284
01:11:15,714 --> 01:11:17,082
Turn, hung, turn!

1285
01:11:21,786 --> 01:11:23,454
Turn the other way!

1286
01:11:46,876 --> 01:11:49,512
- That's right! -Who?

1287
01:11:49,712 --> 01:11:50,946
Great!

1288
01:11:51,113 --> 01:11:55,317
Also, if our team wins, we will definitely give hyung a present.

1289
01:12:09,797 --> 01:12:11,699
I am so curious right now.

1290
01:12:11,899 --> 01:12:13,634
How nerve-wrecking!

1291
01:12:43,595 --> 01:12:44,462
Who?

1292
01:12:44,596 --> 01:12:47,131
You don't need to be surprised. Just sit.

1293
01:12:47,198 --> 01:12:49,100
Now Suk Jin hyung is dead.

1294
01:12:49,667 --> 01:12:50,901
It is 2 vs 1 now.

1295
01:12:50,968 --> 01:12:54,371
- Yes, 2 vs 1. - Jae Suk hyung and Gary versus Ji Ho hyung.

1296
01:12:54,405 --> 01:12:56,106
There is still competition.

1297
01:13:19,194 --> 01:13:20,529
Ah, hyung.

1298
01:13:20,896 --> 01:13:22,597
Do you want to play Rock Scissors Paper?

1299
01:13:22,897 --> 01:13:24,065
Oh, that is not a bad idea.

1300
01:13:24,466 --> 01:13:26,167
Really, let’s play one round.

1301
01:13:26,401 --> 01:13:27,635
- Just one round. - And after that?

1302
01:13:27,769 --> 01:13:29,770
Then the loser will cleanly let himself be eliminated.

1303
01:13:29,804 --> 01:13:31,272
- Really? - Yes.

1304
01:13:32,406 --> 01:13:33,974
Hyung, wait a moment.

1305
01:13:34,408 --> 01:13:35,976
Isn't this disadvantageous to us?

1306
01:13:36,010 --> 01:13:37,644
Isn't this only for fools?

1307
01:13:37,945 --> 01:13:39,680
No, the chances are 50/50 anyway.

1308
01:13:40,147 --> 01:13:41,615
It is just do or die.

1309
01:13:48,021 --> 01:13:49,055
Hang on a moment.

1310
01:13:49,122 --> 01:13:50,990
- Let us have a discussion first. - All right, discuss.

1311
01:13:51,023 --> 01:13:52,491
We will discuss, hang on.

1312
01:13:55,494 --> 01:13:56,695
There is only 5 minutes left.

1313
01:13:57,229 --> 01:13:57,696
We got it.

1314
01:13:57,696 --> 01:13:58,831
We will discuss for a bit.

1315
01:14:02,834 --> 01:14:03,535
Ok, then.

1316
01:14:04,135 --> 01:14:07,805
Honestly, before the discussion...

1317
01:14:07,872 --> 01:14:08,806
Oh!

1318
01:14:12,943 --> 01:14:14,045
Because you're taking your time!

1319
01:14:16,447 --> 01:14:18,715
You want us to be faster,.,?

1320
01:14:18,882 --> 01:14:19,616
He's a lion.

1321
01:14:19,616 --> 01:14:21,118
You guys have to be faster.

1322
01:14:21,151 --> 01:14:21,952
He’s really a lion.

1323
01:14:23,253 --> 01:14:23,987
Hurry,

1324
01:14:26,856 --> 01:14:28,157
Rock Scissors Paper!

1325
01:14:30,727 --> 01:14:31,794
No one wins, hyung!

1326
01:14:32,495 --> 01:14:33,829
Ah, calm down.

1327
01:14:34,030 --> 01:14:36,832
Rock Scissors Paper!

1328
01:14:38,267 --> 01:14:39,201
Yay!

1329
01:14:40,068 --> 01:14:40,869
Rock Scissors Paper!

1330
01:14:40,903 --> 01:14:41,603
Yay!

1331
01:14:57,484 --> 01:14:59,119
You got cheated!

1332
01:15:02,055 --> 01:15:03,356
Rock Scissors Paper!

1333
01:15:25,076 --> 01:15:26,645
Jae Suk hyung!

1334
01:15:58,407 --> 01:16:00,876
Jae Suk hyung!

1335
01:16:08,950 --> 01:16:09,784
Hurry!

1336
01:16:26,166 --> 01:16:28,935
We won!

1337
01:16:30,103 --> 01:16:31,204
We caught the lion!

1338
01:16:31,704 --> 01:16:32,605
We!

1339
01:16:34,574 --> 01:16:35,608
Aigoo,

1340
01:16:45,584 --> 01:16:47,252
Rock Scissors Paper was too good!

1341
01:16:54,192 --> 01:16:57,295
Ji Ho, you have worked hard.

1342
01:16:57,528 --> 01:16:58,362
Wow.

1343
01:16:59,563 --> 01:17:01,832
Since I was born, the only thing that doesn't lie is Rock Paper Scissors.

1344
01:17:01,932 --> 01:17:04,101
Wow, you are too much!

1345
01:17:04,101 --> 01:17:06,269
You started attacking us even before we started playing Rock Scissors Paper!

1346
01:17:08,205 --> 01:17:09,606
I had no time left that’s why!

1347
01:17:12,075 --> 01:17:14,344
If it wasn't for the lack of time, it may not turn out this way.

1348
01:17:15,812 --> 01:17:17,313
We have to open and have a look.

1349
01:17:17,380 --> 01:17:19,582
Hyung, seems like the label isn't here.

1350
01:17:22,484 --> 01:17:24,620
If there isn't then this is not valid right?

1351
01:17:26,655 --> 01:17:27,489
It's moot?

1352
01:17:28,356 --> 01:17:29,991
Because you threw it away.

1353
01:17:30,191 --> 01:17:31,292
I picked up any one of them.

1354
01:17:31,292 --> 01:17:32,760
Then no one will get the reward.

1355
01:17:32,794 --> 01:17:33,394
Huh?

1356
01:17:33,995 --> 01:17:35,697
It will not happen.

1357
01:17:37,832 --> 01:17:38,933
Mine does not have it.

1358
01:17:39,266 --> 01:17:40,568
Wait a minute.

1359
01:17:40,668 --> 01:17:42,169
My hand is trembling.

1360
01:17:42,202 --> 01:17:43,270
-Don't tremble. -Hyung.

1361
01:17:43,570 --> 01:17:45,005
Is this Ji Ho's doing?

1362
01:17:45,205 --> 01:17:46,907
It should not be switched.

1363
01:17:47,074 --> 01:17:48,608
My hand is trembling more now.

1364
01:18:02,221 --> 01:18:03,656
Oh gosh.

1365
01:18:04,123 --> 01:18:05,224
You checked it, didn't you?

1366
01:18:09,928 --> 01:18:11,930
Oh, I thought all our gifts were going to the wind!

1367
01:18:12,464 --> 01:18:14,399
- Is it there? - It's here.

1368
01:18:15,533 --> 01:18:16,801
I thought it was mine,

1369
01:18:16,868 --> 01:18:17,969
- If it was Ji Ho's... - Right.

1370
01:18:19,303 --> 01:18:21,705
Scared me. It gave me a scare.

1371
01:18:24,575 --> 01:18:25,476
What?

1372
01:18:28,945 --> 01:18:30,480
You worked hard oppa.
