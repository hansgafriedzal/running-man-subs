1
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:08,559
Faceoff combat

2
00:00:09,327 --> 00:00:11,696
Let's compete...real fresh

3
00:00:11,696 --> 00:00:13,230
We're here

4
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:14,231
Where are you?

5
00:00:14,231 --> 00:00:15,132
Where?

6
00:00:15,132 --> 00:00:16,133
No

7
00:00:16,133 --> 00:00:18,069
No way

8
00:00:18,803 --> 00:00:20,404
What do I do?

9
00:00:43,427 --> 00:00:46,664
yeah...wow

10
00:00:51,502 --> 00:00:52,636
yah yah yah

11
00:00:53,437 --> 00:00:55,006
wohoh

12
00:00:55,573 --> 00:00:58,976
Hey! You over there!

13
00:00:58,976 --> 00:01:00,845
Oh it's cold

14
00:01:01,879 --> 00:01:03,848
It's really cold

15
00:01:05,483 --> 00:01:07,184
Ah nice

16
00:01:15,693 --> 00:01:18,129
Make some noises!

17
00:01:19,897 --> 00:01:22,299
Make some noises!

18
00:01:22,967 --> 00:01:24,635
No we..

19
00:01:24,635 --> 00:01:26,537
Hey be careful, you can get hurt.

20
00:01:26,537 --> 00:01:28,139
Watch out

21
00:01:29,306 --> 00:01:33,210
It's high! It's high!

22
00:01:36,247 --> 00:01:38,849
You are definitely on top of my palms

23
00:01:39,116 --> 00:01:41,285
Why are you like that...really

24
00:01:41,285 --> 00:01:43,888
Today is combat

25
00:01:43,888 --> 00:01:45,222
What?!

26
00:01:45,523 --> 00:01:47,525
Combat, combat!

27
00:01:52,563 --> 00:01:55,533
The guests will be arriving

28
00:01:58,235 --> 00:02:00,571
They'll be coming here.

29
00:02:03,007 --> 00:02:04,975
Are they taking a boat?

30
00:02:04,975 --> 00:02:06,744
Are they taking a helicopter?

31
00:02:06,744 --> 00:02:08,145
No way...

32
00:02:08,145 --> 00:02:10,781
There's a landing spot over there.

33
00:02:11,048 --> 00:02:13,050
They must be coming in a helicopter then.

34
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:13,784
Really?

35
00:02:13,784 --> 00:02:15,086
Eyy no way!

36
00:02:15,086 --> 00:02:16,687
I think they really are

37
00:02:16,687 --> 00:02:19,090
Awesome! Awesome! Wow!

38
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:21,525
It's coming towards us.

39
00:02:37,808 --> 00:02:40,845
Wind ah wind!

40
00:02:58,329 --> 00:03:00,164
I was right!

41
00:03:01,398 --> 00:03:03,901
Seung Ri! Seuring!

42
00:03:03,901 --> 00:03:05,302
There's Tae Yang

43
00:03:05,302 --> 00:03:06,637
Awesome!

44
00:03:06,637 --> 00:03:09,006
GD, and there's Dae Sung! Dae Sung ah!

45
00:03:09,006 --> 00:03:10,608
It's really BIG BANG!

46
00:03:11,175 --> 00:03:13,711
How long has it been, guys?

47
00:03:17,648 --> 00:03:19,917
Hello

48
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,855
'They look cool.

49
00:03:28,025 --> 00:03:30,261
How are you?

50
00:03:30,261 --> 00:03:31,729
Stop it!

51
00:03:32,463 --> 00:03:34,532
I mean!

52
00:03:34,532 --> 00:03:38,435
Just take a picture of the sun (Tae Yang)

53
00:03:38,435 --> 00:03:44,208
What is this? What is this? Really?!

54
00:03:44,942 --> 00:03:48,379
It shouldn't be like this. No...

55
00:03:48,379 --> 00:03:51,282
We look like we got dressed up

56
00:03:52,349 --> 00:03:56,554
If you knew BIG BANG brothers were coming you should've told us!

57
00:03:56,554 --> 00:04:01,091
I have special attire I saved to wear when I see these guys

58
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:03,494
Green leather jacket?

59
00:04:03,494 --> 00:04:04,962
No no

60
00:04:04,962 --> 00:04:07,798
Anyway BIG BANG is here. BIG BANG!

61
00:04:22,379 --> 00:04:23,547
Did you know?

62
00:04:23,547 --> 00:04:25,449
Did you know that?

63
00:04:25,449 --> 00:04:28,319
HAHA is planning a faceoff with you guys.

64
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:30,888
He has a new album. His album gets released on the same day

65
00:04:30,888 --> 00:04:32,890
HAHA come here.

66
00:04:36,627 --> 00:04:39,663
You guys will win. But...

67
00:04:39,663 --> 00:04:40,965
You guys will win, definitely. But...

68
00:04:40,965 --> 00:04:42,466
I need to live too.

69
00:04:42,466 --> 00:04:43,500
I need to survive

70
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,336
You look really pitiful.

71
00:04:45,336 --> 00:04:47,371
you guys release on the 29th, right?

72
00:04:47,371 --> 00:04:48,038
Yes.

73
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:49,406
Mine releases on the 28th.

74
00:04:49,406 --> 00:04:51,375
Let's battle for ranking

75
00:04:52,843 --> 00:04:55,145
Okay. Let's battle. With me.

76
00:04:55,145 --> 00:04:57,648
Mine comes out on the 27th.

77
00:04:57,648 --> 00:04:59,917
You come to KangNam station

78
00:05:00,651 --> 00:05:03,020
I will on the 27th.

79
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:03,587
Yah!

80
00:05:03,587 --> 00:05:04,555
You're too old-fashioned!

81
00:05:04,555 --> 00:05:07,591
Go away!

82
00:05:08,692 --> 00:05:11,895
Hey TOP why do you have sores here?

83
00:05:11,895 --> 00:05:16,400
Oh I've been getting ready these days so I haven't slept in 2 days.

84
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,635
Oh really?

85
00:05:17,635 --> 00:05:20,371
Dae Sung I haven't seen you hair like that for a while. Dyed.

86
00:05:20,371 --> 00:05:22,539
It's the first time.

87
00:05:22,539 --> 00:05:25,142
You feel awkward, don't you! I can tell!

88
00:05:25,142 --> 00:05:27,544
Your face is too tan.

89
00:05:30,481 --> 00:05:34,652
Dae Sung is just like that.

90
00:05:34,652 --> 00:05:37,588
I saw him in the countryside a lot so

91
00:05:38,489 --> 00:05:40,691
We have a country boy here too

92
00:05:40,691 --> 00:05:43,394
Dye your hair too

93
00:05:44,028 --> 00:05:45,329
He did.

94
00:05:45,329 --> 00:05:46,130
He did that.

95
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:48,932
My hair is dyed now!

96
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:51,802
Oh I didn't know.

97
00:05:51,802 --> 00:05:52,703
Why not!

98
00:05:52,703 --> 00:05:54,571
I will give out the mission card

99
00:05:55,506 --> 00:05:56,607
Hey giraffe!

100
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:59,209
And this team G-Dragon

101
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:03,180
What's today's mission?

102
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:04,848
Let's see.

103
00:06:04,848 --> 00:06:06,317
Divide the teams into defence and offence.

104
00:06:06,317 --> 00:06:09,887
Each member in one team has bells, and needs to take the other team's members out.

105
00:06:09,887 --> 00:06:12,423
Frontal Victory?

106
00:06:18,395 --> 00:06:20,364
No this isn't it.

107
00:06:26,437 --> 00:06:28,972
So we take turns one by one?

108
00:06:28,972 --> 00:06:31,508
That's correct

109
00:06:31,508 --> 00:06:36,613
Also in the latter game. Only the team with the bells can rip off name tags.

110
00:06:37,247 --> 00:06:42,252
So if ripped off all the name tags, that team wins.

111
00:06:42,252 --> 00:06:45,489
Running man team has 2 more persons so we will give them a handicap.

112
00:06:45,489 --> 00:06:47,424
I will go there.

113
00:06:47,424 --> 00:06:49,193
No me.

114
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:53,530
Choose two members from running man team,

115
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:56,166
and those two will walk together with a bracelet.

116
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:59,603
If the bracelet is broken then both are out.

117
00:06:59,603 --> 00:07:00,704
Please choose two.

118
00:07:00,704 --> 00:07:03,073
-Feel, choke! -Easy brothers

119
00:07:04,375 --> 00:07:08,078
When are you gonna stop doing feel chok?

120
00:07:09,146 --> 00:07:11,248
Who would you like to have the bracelets?

121
00:07:11,248 --> 00:07:13,617
Let's go with BIG BANG deciding?

122
00:07:13,617 --> 00:07:17,621
Hmm...

123
00:07:19,089 --> 00:07:20,758
Oh you're handsome.

124
00:07:20,758 --> 00:07:23,494
He's handsome even with that strand of hair.

125
00:07:23,994 --> 00:07:26,230
Should I try growing that too?

126
00:07:30,634 --> 00:07:35,105
We want Jong Kook and Gwang Soo.

127
00:07:35,105 --> 00:07:39,376
Okay. BIG BANG said Jong Kook and Gwang Soo.

128
00:07:41,145 --> 00:07:43,447
No way! Seriously.

129
00:07:44,481 --> 00:07:46,383
You're the best.

130
00:07:46,383 --> 00:07:48,652
Tiger and giraffe again!

131
00:07:48,652 --> 00:07:52,890
Oh I mean! It's not like we're in Serengeti.

132
00:07:53,857 --> 00:07:57,895
And before we start the game,

133
00:07:57,895 --> 00:08:01,865
I'll give a new weapon to one of the teams.

134
00:08:01,865 --> 00:08:05,836
Teams can choose through a simple game now.

135
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:07,104
They're name tags.

136
00:08:07,104 --> 00:08:08,605
Oh It's name tags.

137
00:08:08,605 --> 00:08:10,007
Yeah they are.

138
00:08:10,007 --> 00:08:11,975
Who wants to go first?

139
00:08:12,309 --> 00:08:14,878
BIG BANG will go first.

140
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:19,616
Seung Ri hasn't changed.

141
00:08:19,616 --> 00:08:22,519
He knows how to say what he wants right away.

142
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:24,822
It's TOP.

143
00:08:24,822 --> 00:08:27,191
His mouth is open.

144
00:08:49,546 --> 00:08:53,083
Oh I thought I was getting one.

145
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:55,352
I thought I rolled one so..

146
00:08:55,352 --> 00:08:59,022
I've never seen TOP that happy

147
00:09:02,893 --> 00:09:05,095
I thought I rolled one.

148
00:09:10,834 --> 00:09:12,636
It's a three, not six.

149
00:09:15,572 --> 00:09:18,141
Let's throw once more.

150
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:20,611
This time our team goes first

151
00:09:48,872 --> 00:09:51,041
The man who rules time!

152
00:09:51,041 --> 00:09:53,810
The man who does nothing right

153
00:09:56,313 --> 00:09:58,815
BIG BANG come choose one first and then running man team can choose next.

154
00:09:58,815 --> 00:10:00,551
It's okay, it's okay.

155
00:10:04,087 --> 00:10:05,722
GD, what is that?

156
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:08,225
Gary choose one!

157
00:10:08,225 --> 00:10:11,695
-Me? I'll choose this one. -Of course!

158
00:10:14,665 --> 00:10:19,002
These weapons have never been used in Running Man so no one knows what they are.

159
00:10:19,002 --> 00:10:21,171
Really?

160
00:10:21,171 --> 00:10:25,175
From now on the combat race has started!

161
00:10:25,175 --> 00:10:28,345
The team that sets off first has advantages.

162
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:37,387
What's with Tae Yang?

163
00:10:37,387 --> 00:10:39,656
He left just now.

164
00:10:41,959 --> 00:10:44,728
He said it's advantageous to leave first so...

165
00:10:44,728 --> 00:10:48,165
We have to learn from them.

166
00:10:48,165 --> 00:10:50,467
Are you kidding? We're normal.

167
00:10:50,467 --> 00:10:54,371
From our team, Gary will be in charge of Tae Yang.

168
00:10:54,371 --> 00:10:55,906
Oh really?

169
00:10:58,842 --> 00:11:00,811
Dae Sung and Jong Kook.

170
00:11:01,345 --> 00:11:03,814
Please call us Gae Yang.

171
00:11:03,814 --> 00:11:05,649
Gae Yang

172
00:11:06,016 --> 00:11:09,353
Seung Ri (victory) and loss

173
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:17,861
TOP and...

174
00:11:17,861 --> 00:11:19,196
me

175
00:11:19,196 --> 00:11:21,865
No! Gwang Soo Gwang Soo

176
00:11:21,865 --> 00:11:22,799
Why!

177
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:27,938
-You're too short. Gwang Soo is the top between us. -Height wise.

178
00:11:28,572 --> 00:11:30,273
GD...

179
00:11:32,576 --> 00:11:36,880
I think GD and Jihyp

180
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,483
Am I their manager?

181
00:11:41,852 --> 00:11:42,953
Not manager.

182
00:11:42,953 --> 00:11:44,821
I'm on to you!

183
00:11:44,821 --> 00:11:47,290
Ah, I mean, TOP.

184
00:11:51,461 --> 00:11:52,629
yah

185
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:54,398
Where are we going?

186
00:11:54,398 --> 00:12:00,437
It says SukDae Moon Museum.

187
00:12:01,738 --> 00:12:06,076
Natural history museum?

188
00:12:18,121 --> 00:12:20,290
We have two sheets

189
00:12:24,227 --> 00:12:26,830
Small one first

190
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:29,332
Oh it's nothing

191
00:12:32,736 --> 00:12:34,738
Oh it's nothing

192
00:12:41,878 --> 00:12:43,046
I knew it.

193
00:12:43,046 --> 00:12:44,614
They have it.

194
00:12:44,614 --> 00:12:48,452
They shall be placed inside the name tag like spy tags.

195
00:12:48,452 --> 00:12:55,992
If your name tag is ripped off, the person who ripped it is also out.

196
00:13:06,536 --> 00:13:08,071
Do we do it secretly?

197
00:13:08,071 --> 00:13:11,074
We decide between ourselves and stick it.

198
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:16,446
But if Jong Kook rips it, he has a bracelet so we get two out.

199
00:13:16,446 --> 00:13:20,150
With Suk Jin hyung or something we can't die.

200
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:28,358
-Song Ji Hyo sister. -Ji Hyo or Jong Kook.

201
00:13:28,358 --> 00:13:32,629
Jae Suk hyung is good too. He's quite strong as well.

202
00:13:34,598 --> 00:13:37,367
I don't get this game yet.

203
00:13:38,769 --> 00:13:40,570
Do we have bells?

204
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:42,606
We don't know. We'll find out there.

205
00:13:42,606 --> 00:13:43,974
Either case we take turns.

206
00:13:43,974 --> 00:13:45,442
With the bells,

207
00:13:46,376 --> 00:13:53,250
we chase them around. When we don't have bells we hide and run.

208
00:13:57,053 --> 00:13:58,688
What would the weapon be?

209
00:13:58,688 --> 00:14:01,258
They said it's never been on the show.

210
00:14:01,258 --> 00:14:03,660
I don't think it's anything so good.

211
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:07,898
Yeah but I think one or two people will get out with the weapon.

212
00:14:07,898 --> 00:14:09,499
Suk Jin or Gwang Soo.

213
00:14:09,499 --> 00:14:11,902
If Gwang Soo gets out then you get out too.

214
00:14:11,902 --> 00:14:16,206
-Oh right. Really. I'm gonna die. -I'll just break the bracelet.

215
00:14:16,206 --> 00:14:20,243
Jong Kook whether you want or not you have to protect Gwang Soo.

216
00:14:31,621 --> 00:14:36,326
-I think we have to get off here. -Hurry, hurry!

217
00:14:36,326 --> 00:14:38,695
Okay. Let's go.

218
00:15:01,017 --> 00:15:02,185
Can we go in?

219
00:15:02,185 --> 00:15:03,220
Yes.

220
00:15:03,854 --> 00:15:05,789
Hey you, that!

221
00:15:05,789 --> 00:15:07,757
Oh right.

222
00:15:15,565 --> 00:15:17,334
Wow dinosaur!

223
00:15:17,334 --> 00:15:21,304
Big Bang enters! Big Bang enters!

224
00:15:21,304 --> 00:15:23,106
I only saw this on tv.

225
00:15:23,106 --> 00:15:25,141
It's here, isn't it?

226
00:15:28,812 --> 00:15:30,347
What is this?

227
00:15:32,449 --> 00:15:37,254
Take the bells if you want to be the offence team in the first term.

228
00:15:37,254 --> 00:15:40,156
Or enter without the bells if you want to offend in the second term.

229
00:15:40,156 --> 00:15:42,325
Oh we can choose!

230
00:15:42,325 --> 00:15:44,995
They must have not arrived yet.

231
00:15:46,763 --> 00:15:50,033
Let's hide first so it's relaxed.

232
00:15:50,033 --> 00:15:52,535
How is it relaxing? Is it?

233
00:15:52,535 --> 00:15:53,970
I think it's better if we chase first.

234
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:55,505
I agree with Seung Ri.

235
00:15:55,505 --> 00:16:00,677
No it's better to hide and analyse and then attack in the latter half.

236
00:16:00,677 --> 00:16:04,147
Cause we have these bombs too.

237
00:16:05,482 --> 00:16:07,651
Oh you are right.

238
00:16:09,452 --> 00:16:11,254
We'll hide.

239
00:16:16,526 --> 00:16:21,564
Avoiding the team with bells, and find 5 running man cards.

240
00:16:31,508 --> 00:16:33,076
So we should start looking?

241
00:16:33,076 --> 00:16:36,179
Wait who's going to have the bombs?

242
00:16:38,148 --> 00:16:43,553
We have to get caught by Jong Kook, Gwang Soo, or Ji Hyo.

243
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:48,925
At least avoid Suk Jin hyung.

244
00:16:54,097 --> 00:16:56,499
Okay we'll go. Fighting.

245
00:16:58,034 --> 00:17:01,204
First we have to familiarize with the location.

246
00:17:01,204 --> 00:17:02,906
Can I stay with you?

247
00:17:02,906 --> 00:17:04,107
For now ok.

248
00:17:04,107 --> 00:17:06,376
How do we determine the mapping?

249
00:17:06,376 --> 00:17:13,416
Look for emergency exits and we have to be careful cause we have bright hair.

250
00:17:15,218 --> 00:17:18,855
Life Cycle room

251
00:17:33,269 --> 00:17:37,173
Oh I found one! As soon as we started.

252
00:17:37,173 --> 00:17:39,476
It's a good start, good start.

253
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:49,786
What is Run Kwang Man?

254
00:17:53,623 --> 00:17:56,059
It looks like this!

255
00:17:57,327 --> 00:17:59,496
We have one here too.

256
00:18:03,533 --> 00:18:04,768
There're lots of fake ones.

257
00:18:04,768 --> 00:18:06,770
They found one too.

258
00:18:08,204 --> 00:18:09,839
There are too many.

259
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:11,041
Ah it's Run Kwang Man.

260
00:18:11,041 --> 00:18:14,644
Hyung, there are a lot of cards but all Kwang.

261
00:18:18,915 --> 00:18:22,652
Hyung we don't have time to look at the animals.

262
00:18:22,652 --> 00:18:25,422
Really its glass. There's no way it would be in there.

263
00:18:25,422 --> 00:18:28,224
Hyung stop looking at the animals.

264
00:18:28,224 --> 00:18:31,528
We don't have time for that. I know cause I tried it.

265
00:18:31,528 --> 00:18:34,864
You can't throw these out.

266
00:18:36,366 --> 00:18:39,069
-Why? -So they don't know we've been here?

267
00:18:39,069 --> 00:18:43,973
Yeah we can't leave traces. There's no blood or tears here.

268
00:18:45,408 --> 00:18:49,012
It's here. You tease me about my small eyes,

269
00:18:49,012 --> 00:18:53,450
but I can see better than you. -Haha okay.

270
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:57,520
You have to find it and scratch it in 1 second.

271
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:00,323
If it's nothing then you have to run.

272
00:19:00,323 --> 00:19:02,625
you need this swiftness.

273
00:19:06,329 --> 00:19:08,498
I have to find it quickly.

274
00:19:10,967 --> 00:19:13,403
It's here. it's here.

275
00:19:49,873 --> 00:19:55,411
-We are here. -There's the panel! There's the panel hyung.

276
00:19:55,411 --> 00:19:57,780
Did we beat them?

277
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:02,118
I think we're just starting.

278
00:20:05,188 --> 00:20:09,926
Running Man enters.

279
00:20:15,832 --> 00:20:18,434
Running Man enters.

280
00:20:18,434 --> 00:20:26,176
-This is really scary. -Since our hairs stand out so much we have to be really careful. Fighting!

281
00:20:33,683 --> 00:20:35,885
Yah what is this?

282
00:20:40,223 --> 00:20:42,025
Seems like they're already here.

283
00:20:42,025 --> 00:20:44,460
It's like the museum is alive.

284
00:20:51,534 --> 00:20:53,536
Did BIG BANG already come?

285
00:20:54,771 --> 00:20:57,273
It seems like they have.

286
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:02,679
Oh so we have to get it first?

287
00:21:03,646 --> 00:21:06,649
hey you guys, here!

288
00:21:09,152 --> 00:21:11,854
Oh do I have to hold hands with him?

289
00:21:16,292 --> 00:21:19,762
Wow I haven't heard this sound in so long

290
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:23,733
The bell's sound is really loud.

291
00:21:23,733 --> 00:21:26,703
being here all together feels good.

292
00:21:26,703 --> 00:21:29,138
It must be really scary.

293
00:21:29,138 --> 00:21:33,476
With these bells on, I fee so invincible.

294
00:21:35,812 --> 00:21:38,014
There are only three floors.

295
00:21:38,014 --> 00:21:39,716
Guys, where are you?

296
00:21:39,716 --> 00:21:40,984
This place is kind of small, isn't it?

297
00:21:40,984 --> 00:21:44,087
You guys don't even have anywhere to go.

298
00:21:44,087 --> 00:21:45,855
GD come out.

299
00:21:46,889 --> 00:21:47,957
GD

300
00:21:47,957 --> 00:21:49,626
Dae Sung ah

301
00:21:55,531 --> 00:21:57,333
I feel old already...

302
00:22:35,305 --> 00:22:41,244
I feel like they're going to be around here.

303
00:22:41,744 --> 00:22:45,214
I know how the mind works for people who are hiding.

304
00:22:46,149 --> 00:22:48,685
Kids, where are you?

305
00:22:50,286 --> 00:22:52,088
Kids

306
00:22:56,826 --> 00:22:59,329
This is the second floor right?

307
00:22:59,329 --> 00:23:00,963
-No, the first. -First?

308
00:23:00,963 --> 00:23:04,967
Really?

309
00:23:05,802 --> 00:23:11,074
GD where are you going? GD Where are you?

310
00:23:11,074 --> 00:23:14,143
Gd Where are you?

311
00:23:14,143 --> 00:23:18,314
GD where are you going? GD! Where are you?

312
00:23:23,286 --> 00:23:26,956
Oh my gosh, this place is too small.

313
00:23:32,595 --> 00:23:36,399
Ji Yong ah, where are you?

314
00:23:36,399 --> 00:23:39,001
Where did he go?

315
00:23:42,372 --> 00:23:45,341
Ji Yong ah. Where did he go?

316
00:23:45,341 --> 00:23:47,677
Ji Hyo, where did Ji Yong go?

317
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:56,486
Where is Ji Yong?

318
00:23:57,053 --> 00:24:00,189
Where is Ji Yong? Have you seen Ji Yong by any chance?

319
00:24:00,189 --> 00:24:02,425
No, I'm not sure.

320
00:24:02,425 --> 00:24:06,095
Where is Ji Yong? Where is he?

321
00:24:06,095 --> 00:24:08,564
Where is Ji Yong, Ji Hyo?

322
00:24:08,564 --> 00:24:10,666
Where is he?

323
00:24:14,036 --> 00:24:16,105
This is so hard

324
00:24:22,678 --> 00:24:26,649
I feel like there's something here.

325
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:33,723
Why are you shaking so much tough?

326
00:24:33,723 --> 00:24:36,192
Are you nervous?

327
00:24:36,692 --> 00:24:41,564
-Stop shaking so much I feel like I'm holding a girls hand. -I'm shaky.

328
00:24:45,735 --> 00:24:46,803
They are not here.

329
00:24:46,803 --> 00:24:48,604
We can't find them.

330
00:24:49,405 --> 00:24:51,307
Dong-hyun

331
00:24:52,208 --> 00:24:54,143
hyung, where are they?

332
00:24:55,445 --> 00:24:58,214
Let's just drink this.

333
00:25:05,855 --> 00:25:09,692
Sorry, it' s because it was a little bit high.

334
00:25:13,095 --> 00:25:15,231
Why are you guys here

335
00:25:15,231 --> 00:25:17,467
We decided to come here.

336
00:25:34,083 --> 00:25:35,585
Please.

337
00:25:36,385 --> 00:25:37,587
Kwang Kwang

338
00:25:37,587 --> 00:25:40,857
Because it's too obvious, this place.

339
00:25:42,291 --> 00:25:44,260
Nothing.

340
00:25:46,929 --> 00:25:50,967
I found so much but none of them are real.

341
00:25:51,734 --> 00:25:54,237
grasshoppers

342
00:26:16,659 --> 00:26:18,361
Running Man!

343
00:26:20,196 --> 00:26:23,099
I found Running Man!

344
00:26:26,435 --> 00:26:32,108
Mission 20 % complete

345
00:26:37,346 --> 00:26:40,283
Mission 20 % complete

346
00:26:42,151 --> 00:26:45,821
Oh? They're doing a mission!

347
00:26:46,722 --> 00:26:49,892
Figure out what's the mission, hurry!

348
00:26:50,459 --> 00:26:52,495
We have to know it.

349
00:27:27,964 --> 00:27:30,433
Gary hyung, look at this

350
00:27:32,368 --> 00:27:33,903
Gary hyung, look at this.

351
00:27:33,903 --> 00:27:35,271
What is it?

352
00:27:37,273 --> 00:27:39,442
We're on the same team.

353
00:27:40,209 --> 00:27:43,245
Oh?! What's this?

354
00:27:44,947 --> 00:27:47,083
We're on the same team.

355
00:27:47,083 --> 00:27:48,484
Really?

356
00:27:48,484 --> 00:27:49,752
Why are you wearing this?

357
00:27:49,752 --> 00:27:51,687
-Oh it's only you? -The rules of the spy changed.

358
00:27:51,687 --> 00:27:54,223
They said there's no spy today?

359
00:27:54,624 --> 00:27:59,428
-Was it not? -Of course they would say there's no spy. They would say there isn't any when there is.

360
00:27:59,428 --> 00:28:01,263
You're right , I think the same thing.

361
00:28:01,263 --> 00:28:02,832
Wait, are you the only one wearing this?

362
00:28:02,832 --> 00:28:04,867
That's what I'm saying, I'm the spy.

363
00:28:05,368 --> 00:28:07,336
Gwang Soo and Jong Kook are together, right?

364
00:28:07,336 --> 00:28:08,504
Yeah.

365
00:28:08,504 --> 00:28:14,744
The members can't know, seriously! Don't say anything.

366
00:28:15,344 --> 00:28:22,652
Alright, you're not saying some nonsense right?

367
00:28:22,652 --> 00:28:25,054
I don't get fooled easily.

368
00:28:25,054 --> 00:28:28,457
-You can't fool me anymore.-Of course!

369
00:28:28,457 --> 00:28:29,859
Alright

370
00:28:30,726 --> 00:28:34,130
You have to be secretive about it.

371
00:28:40,736 --> 00:28:44,807
I just saw Seung Ri and he's wearing a bell.

372
00:28:51,414 --> 00:28:53,449
hey stay there! Stay there!

373
00:28:53,449 --> 00:28:54,784
Wait, what is this?

374
00:28:54,784 --> 00:29:00,256
-My brain's not really good right now. So you can go confirm it. -Go back! Go back!! I'll be right back.

375
00:29:03,926 --> 00:29:06,062
-Gary. -Yes.

376
00:29:06,062 --> 00:29:09,465
-There's someone here, come down come down.

377
00:29:14,203 --> 00:29:15,371
Did you not hear?

378
00:29:15,371 --> 00:29:17,673
No I didn't hear anything...

379
00:29:18,307 --> 00:29:21,744
Wait, wait, why?

380
00:29:21,744 --> 00:29:24,213
So in running man,

381
00:29:24,213 --> 00:29:35,024
There are seven people and Jong Kook and Gwang Soo are spies from the seven but for Running man, I'm the spy.

382
00:29:35,024 --> 00:29:35,925
What?

383
00:29:35,925 --> 00:29:40,296
I'm running men's spy.

384
00:29:40,296 --> 00:29:43,532
Hey. Really though why are you wearing a bell?

385
00:29:43,532 --> 00:29:47,903
Jong Kook and Gwang Soo are spies and I'm running man's spy.

386
00:29:47,903 --> 00:29:49,438
They said there's no spy today.

387
00:29:49,438 --> 00:29:52,675
Of course they'll say there isn't one when there really is!

388
00:29:54,009 --> 00:29:56,445
Do you really think I'd lie?

389
00:29:56,445 --> 00:29:59,081
Tell Jong Kook and Gwang Soo to come here then.

390
00:29:59,548 --> 00:30:01,650
Hide the bell. What are you doing!

391
00:30:02,551 --> 00:30:08,991
Wait, hold on! Don't get close!

392
00:30:08,991 --> 00:30:10,659
Wait, you're wearing a bell?

393
00:30:10,659 --> 00:30:12,928
Wait, what's going on?

394
00:30:14,029 --> 00:30:16,966
he's wearing a bell?

395
00:30:16,966 --> 00:30:20,469
Don't get close.

396
00:30:24,406 --> 00:30:27,143
Why are there so many bells here?

397
00:30:27,143 --> 00:30:28,177
What is this?

398
00:30:28,177 --> 00:30:30,412
You put this on yourself!

399
00:30:30,412 --> 00:30:33,949
No I didn't!

400
00:30:35,718 --> 00:30:37,486
Look at all these bells.

401
00:30:37,486 --> 00:30:40,656
You didn't see this bag of bells before?

402
00:30:42,691 --> 00:30:46,295
He said Jong Kook was the spy.

403
00:30:46,295 --> 00:30:47,429
He is the spy.

404
00:30:47,429 --> 00:30:48,731
Come here. Come here!

405
00:30:48,731 --> 00:30:50,866
Then you're going to lose!

406
00:30:51,467 --> 00:30:55,204
Come here. Come here!

407
00:30:55,204 --> 00:30:57,139
I'm the spy!

408
00:30:57,506 --> 00:31:04,313
Seung Ri out.

409
00:31:04,313 --> 00:31:08,717
Hey hey. Look at all these bells. Take them!

410
00:31:08,717 --> 00:31:11,687
Gary hyung was here first and was like "really?!"

411
00:31:11,687 --> 00:31:17,760
You know what Gary said? He said "our bells are silver but Seung Ri's is gold coloured!"

412
00:31:28,504 --> 00:31:31,040
This is hard, hard!

413
00:31:33,275 --> 00:31:35,444
It's already hard enough to run around like this,

414
00:31:35,444 --> 00:31:38,981
and we have to find this card. It just make it more difficult.

415
00:31:45,754 --> 00:31:47,489
Oh sorry.

416
00:32:24,894 --> 00:32:26,829
RUNNING MAN!

417
00:32:33,435 --> 00:32:43,779
Mission 60% complete.

418
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:53,355
How did they get 60%?

419
00:32:53,355 --> 00:32:57,092
We should be running around, we have no time to be doing this.

420
00:33:03,132 --> 00:33:05,401
Did someone get caught?

421
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:13,342
It's T.O.P!

422
00:33:15,444 --> 00:33:17,212
It's T.O.P!

423
00:33:19,248 --> 00:33:24,253
Hey T.O.P! TOP! I'm going to run.

424
00:33:31,827 --> 00:33:33,595
Where is he? Where?

425
00:33:34,530 --> 00:33:39,835
T.O.P I'm coming! Get him!

426
00:33:39,835 --> 00:33:45,507
TOP! Grab him! TOP!

427
00:33:49,044 --> 00:33:50,679
I'm sorry.

428
00:33:50,679 --> 00:33:54,316
Let's end this once and for all.

429
00:34:04,493 --> 00:34:09,031
Why do you run like this, you should be running faster.

430
00:34:09,031 --> 00:34:11,533
Oh! They got him!

431
00:34:14,636 --> 00:34:18,640
You should've been running faster.

432
00:34:26,215 --> 00:34:28,584
Just tell me what the mission is.

433
00:34:28,584 --> 00:34:29,852
-I know what the mission is. -You know?

434
00:34:29,852 --> 00:34:31,086
They're coupon cards.

435
00:34:31,086 --> 00:34:33,922
oppa!

436
00:34:33,922 --> 00:34:36,025
What is going on right now?

437
00:34:36,025 --> 00:34:39,595
Why is TOP just sitting there and not running away?

438
00:34:50,072 --> 00:34:55,010
Yah! They had the secret weapon. Do you think that's a retaliate?

439
00:35:07,523 --> 00:35:09,258
What is this?

440
00:35:10,359 --> 00:35:12,094
What is this?

441
00:35:12,094 --> 00:35:13,896
What is in there?

442
00:35:14,296 --> 00:35:16,331
Bang?

443
00:35:29,211 --> 00:35:34,349
At least avoid Suk Jin hyung.

444
00:35:34,349 --> 00:35:36,518
What is in there?

445
00:35:36,852 --> 00:35:38,587
Bang?

446
00:35:38,821 --> 00:35:41,590
Ji Suk Jin out!

447
00:35:49,231 --> 00:35:53,035
Yah! You should've properly ran away!

448
00:35:54,603 --> 00:35:58,307
TOP out.

449
00:35:58,307 --> 00:36:02,044
Oh we're out together, together.

450
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:13,856
We have to get them.

451
00:36:13,856 --> 00:36:18,527
They should've been there, we were supposed to have found them by now.

452
00:36:21,897 --> 00:36:25,901
Are they hiding somewhere?

453
00:36:26,368 --> 00:36:29,071
But look here.

454
00:36:30,906 --> 00:36:32,374
Oppa!

455
00:36:32,374 --> 00:36:34,143
Dong-hyun, ah!

456
00:36:34,143 --> 00:36:38,847
They finished a lot of missions on the top so they have to be on the second or first floor?

457
00:36:38,847 --> 00:36:40,382
These are the only exits here and there and even the elevators.

458
00:36:40,382 --> 00:36:42,818
There's one on the elephant's nose!

459
00:36:42,818 --> 00:36:45,020
He's right there.

460
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:49,491
oppa over there!

461
00:37:20,055 --> 00:37:24,326
Hurry! Come here!

462
00:37:28,797 --> 00:37:30,632
Hey Dae Sung!

463
00:37:30,632 --> 00:37:35,404
Dae Sung, come here, come here!

464
00:37:39,975 --> 00:37:42,010
Dae Sung ah!

465
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:55,424
Dae Sung!

466
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:02,397
Why did you take this off!

467
00:38:09,371 --> 00:38:11,907
They've probably been here?

468
00:38:18,313 --> 00:38:20,415
Dae Sung out

469
00:38:20,415 --> 00:38:22,117
Dae Sung out.

470
00:38:22,117 --> 00:38:24,853
It's usually on the floor.

471
00:38:46,942 --> 00:38:48,944
Yah, GD, what are you doing?

472
00:38:48,944 --> 00:38:52,214
-Hyung I was looking for you. -I was looking for you too.

473
00:38:53,315 --> 00:38:57,452
I was looking for GD too.

474
00:38:57,452 --> 00:38:58,487
Oh really?

475
00:38:58,487 --> 00:39:00,822
But GD wouldn't appear anywhere.

476
00:39:00,822 --> 00:39:02,624
Ji Yong, have you seen GD or not?

477
00:39:02,624 --> 00:39:03,592
Oh he was over there.

478
00:39:03,592 --> 00:39:04,393
Oh really, over there?

479
00:39:04,393 --> 00:39:08,397
yeah he went over there on the second floor. I think he went to the roof top.

480
00:39:08,397 --> 00:39:10,866
Ohh yeah I couldn't find him anywhere.

481
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:25,113
I'm supposed to go straight on BIG BANG but what am I worried about? The fans won't understand?

482
00:40:07,622 --> 00:40:09,091
-Ji Yong ah. -Hyung.

483
00:40:09,091 --> 00:40:10,892
GD, have you seen GD?

484
00:40:11,426 --> 00:40:13,962
-He's right there. -Where? Where is he?

485
00:40:13,962 --> 00:40:15,764
Right there, hyung.

486
00:40:15,764 --> 00:40:16,932
I heard he met with you earlier.

487
00:40:16,932 --> 00:40:17,666
Really?

488
00:40:17,666 --> 00:40:19,368
Yes. He went to that side.

489
00:40:19,368 --> 00:40:20,936
-That side? I see. -Yes.

490
00:40:20,936 --> 00:40:22,337
Alright

491
00:40:28,009 --> 00:40:30,212
What should I do?

492
00:40:30,212 --> 00:40:31,847
I can't think straight now.

493
00:40:31,847 --> 00:40:33,548
Oh, what is it?

494
00:40:33,949 --> 00:40:40,322
It's Ji Yong. Yah!

495
00:40:50,399 --> 00:40:54,169
It's Ji Yong. I should've caught him.

496
00:41:05,814 --> 00:41:09,251
Ah, it's all because of HAHA hyung.

497
00:41:15,924 --> 00:41:17,259
We are here!

498
00:41:17,259 --> 00:41:18,527
If you meet with HAHA hyung...

499
00:41:18,527 --> 00:41:20,295
What should I do now?

500
00:41:22,330 --> 00:41:24,533
-Have you seen HAHA hyung? -He's right there! Right there!

501
00:41:24,533 --> 00:41:26,201
He's over there?

502
00:41:28,036 --> 00:41:34,075
Well, Suk Jin hyung is already out now, right?

503
00:41:42,217 --> 00:41:44,686
Hey, Ji Yong ah!

504
00:41:45,487 --> 00:41:49,157
Ji Yong ah! Ji Yong!

505
00:41:53,829 --> 00:41:54,729
Ji Yong ah!

506
00:41:54,729 --> 00:41:56,798
You should go together with your VJ.

507
00:41:57,899 --> 00:42:00,402
Come here. Gather around!

508
00:42:02,237 --> 00:42:04,239
Ji Yong, Ji Yong ah...

509
00:42:04,239 --> 00:42:06,241
-Ahh.. -Ji Yong ah.

510
00:42:09,311 --> 00:42:12,681
Ji Yong ah, Ji Yong ah...Ji Yong

511
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:19,654
GD!

512
00:42:23,892 --> 00:42:25,727
Come here!

513
00:42:37,072 --> 00:42:40,141
Hyung, rip off the tag.

514
00:42:48,717 --> 00:42:53,154
Yoo Jae Suk out! Yoo Jae Suk out!

515
00:42:53,154 --> 00:42:54,689
Yah, he made you out too..

516
00:42:54,689 --> 00:42:56,191
What is that?

517
00:42:59,294 --> 00:43:01,229
Running man is too tiring!

518
00:43:01,229 --> 00:43:03,298
I'm sorry.

519
00:43:15,777 --> 00:43:18,146
SOL! Where are you?

520
00:43:18,513 --> 00:43:20,715
It's me....Gae Yang!

521
00:43:20,715 --> 00:43:25,253
Tae Yang ah! It's me Gae Yang!

522
00:43:33,929 --> 00:43:35,664
Tae Yang.

523
00:43:35,664 --> 00:43:38,133
-How come we can't find him? -He must be hiding in somewhere.

524
00:43:38,133 --> 00:43:40,969
Go inside, maybe he's hiding in there.

525
00:43:49,611 --> 00:43:53,715
Hyung, I heard the door is closed, over there.

526
00:43:53,715 --> 00:43:55,684
Here is right.

527
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,502
There's someone inside. There's someone inside.

528
00:44:30,051 --> 00:44:32,220
Just stay there!

529
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:34,623
I wanna hear too.

530
00:44:37,492 --> 00:44:41,463
I just told you! Don't do that!

531
00:44:42,464 --> 00:44:44,833
Stay still. Stay still.

532
00:44:53,675 --> 00:44:55,910
Don't do that!

533
00:44:55,910 --> 00:44:59,981
He could find out, Gwang Soo.

534
00:45:00,615 --> 00:45:02,651
Just stay here..

535
00:45:02,651 --> 00:45:05,153
I...so, I just stay still like this?

536
00:45:05,153 --> 00:45:07,422
Oh, okay.

537
00:45:27,976 --> 00:45:33,348
What are you doing? Give it to me!

538
00:45:35,116 --> 00:45:40,355
Why did you do that?! Why?!

539
00:45:40,355 --> 00:45:42,924
Let's have some talk.

540
00:45:42,924 --> 00:45:46,294
No, I just want to try once, rip off your name tag.

541
00:45:46,995 --> 00:45:48,596
But why tear off my name tag?

542
00:45:48,596 --> 00:45:54,102
Hyung, I came here...without saying a word, just followed you.

543
00:45:54,102 --> 00:45:55,570
But why did you do that?

544
00:45:55,570 --> 00:45:57,806
-I didn't even say a word, just followed you. -Even though.

545
00:45:57,806 --> 00:46:03,745
I can't listen, I can't eat, I can't even walk as my wish.

546
00:46:06,548 --> 00:46:08,650
I don't know. You didn't have to do that though.

547
00:46:08,650 --> 00:46:10,285
I've been holding it in all this time.

548
00:46:10,285 --> 00:46:11,886
WHAT?

549
00:46:18,426 --> 00:46:20,395
Wait, wait!

550
00:46:20,395 --> 00:46:22,664
Lee Gwang Soo, what should I do with you.

551
00:46:22,664 --> 00:46:27,035
Hyung....Don't joke with me.

552
00:46:27,035 --> 00:46:30,171
-What is going on? What is this all about? -What are you doing?

553
00:46:30,171 --> 00:46:31,873
It didn't get ripped!

554
00:46:31,873 --> 00:46:32,574
What's all this?!

555
00:46:32,574 --> 00:46:35,777
I thought you were a spy, because you teared Jong Kook hyung's name tag.

556
00:46:35,777 --> 00:46:37,846
-So, why did you tear it off? -I thought you were a spy.

557
00:46:37,846 --> 00:46:41,616
-No, it's not like that. -Let me look, are you spy or not.

558
00:46:41,616 --> 00:46:43,685
Why would I?

559
00:46:47,889 --> 00:46:49,224
Hyung...

560
00:46:52,060 --> 00:46:57,298
-What? I really thought you were a spy. -Doesn't he need some time to cool himself, hyung?

561
00:46:57,298 --> 00:47:01,636
Ah, wait, hyung...what should I do then.

562
00:47:06,808 --> 00:47:09,744
Gwang Soo, why did you do that?

563
00:47:10,078 --> 00:47:12,547
Don't come here. Just stay there.

564
00:47:12,981 --> 00:47:15,116
Gwang Soo, come here.

565
00:47:15,116 --> 00:47:18,520
You must don't know that you are in the afternoon section.

566
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:19,554
I just knew before.

567
00:47:19,554 --> 00:47:22,056
You made him out.

568
00:47:22,056 --> 00:47:25,193
Today, you won't come out on tv.

569
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:30,031
You won't come out on this show.

570
00:47:30,865 --> 00:47:32,333
You'll see.

571
00:47:33,835 --> 00:47:36,171
He's inside.

572
00:47:36,171 --> 00:47:39,574
-You scared me. -What are you doing, Tae Yang?

573
00:47:39,574 --> 00:47:43,411
Tae Yang is inside.

574
00:47:43,411 --> 00:47:46,648
Turn around. You were hiding silently in here, I see.

575
00:47:46,648 --> 00:47:48,817
How did you find out that he was hiding in here oppa?

576
00:47:48,817 --> 00:47:52,854
I heard something before, it turned out that he's hiding here.

577
00:47:53,188 --> 00:47:55,957
Let's decide who tears off his name tag.

578
00:47:58,993 --> 00:48:04,332
-Yah! -Hey!!

579
00:48:04,332 --> 00:48:05,767
Ahhhh. What the hell are you doing?

580
00:48:05,767 --> 00:48:07,368
Why you...?

581
00:48:11,339 --> 00:48:13,341
SOL

582
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:21,472
I'm in front of the elevator.

583
00:48:42,670 --> 00:48:44,272
Why you...?

584
00:48:48,243 --> 00:48:50,245
SOL

585
00:48:55,450 --> 00:48:58,386
I'm in front of the elevator.

586
00:49:05,627 --> 00:49:08,963
-Yah -Hey!!

587
00:49:08,963 --> 00:49:10,131
Tae Yang, give up.

588
00:49:10,131 --> 00:49:11,299
Now it's the end for you

589
00:49:11,299 --> 00:49:14,202
-Okay, after I say 1 2 3, let's tear off the name tag. -Ah, I can't run anymore.

590
00:49:14,202 --> 00:49:15,136
Right.

591
00:49:15,136 --> 00:49:18,139
One, two, three.

592
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:21,142
One, two, three.

593
00:49:22,510 --> 00:49:24,345
Tae Yang, I'm sorry.

594
00:49:36,791 --> 00:49:38,660
Finally.

595
00:49:38,660 --> 00:49:40,995
It can't be right. It can't be right.

596
00:49:40,995 --> 00:49:42,964
We lost.

597
00:49:42,964 --> 00:49:45,266
Somehow, I feel that I was insulted.

598
00:49:45,867 --> 00:49:47,735
We didn't do anything...

599
00:49:47,735 --> 00:49:50,905
I feel ashamed.

600
00:49:51,439 --> 00:49:55,076
I was even played (?) by HAHA hyung.

601
00:50:04,152 --> 00:50:06,788
Be ready and get nervous?!

602
00:50:08,990 --> 00:50:11,125
I was insulted

603
00:50:11,125 --> 00:50:13,995
If you see HAHA hyung, let me know.

604
00:50:18,099 --> 00:50:20,234
God, it's driving me crazy.

605
00:50:20,234 --> 00:50:22,070
We were defeated in round 1, you know.

606
00:50:22,070 --> 00:50:24,005
Let's stick together!

607
00:50:24,539 --> 00:50:26,307
Catch him!

608
00:50:29,010 --> 00:50:30,845
Don't shoot me.

609
00:50:38,186 --> 00:50:41,389
Wahhhhh! Wait a second!

610
00:50:42,790 --> 00:50:45,626
NOOO

611
00:50:47,528 --> 00:50:49,831
This is our power.

612
00:50:50,331 --> 00:50:52,900
Wow, we even have a power now.

613
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:53,534
Tae Yang

614
00:50:53,534 --> 00:50:54,335
GD

615
00:50:54,335 --> 00:50:55,069
Seung Ri

616
00:50:55,069 --> 00:50:56,070
Dae Sung

617
00:50:56,070 --> 00:50:56,904
TOP

618
00:50:56,904 --> 00:50:59,440
Joined forces of five ring.

619
00:51:00,141 --> 00:51:01,642
Dominate the space.

620
00:51:01,642 --> 00:51:03,644
Yeah!!

621
00:51:06,748 --> 00:51:10,284
This is the first time I do this kind of thing since I was in elementary school.
