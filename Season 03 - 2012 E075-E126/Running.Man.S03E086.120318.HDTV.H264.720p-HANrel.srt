Hyung, why are you pretending to be cute?

232
00:13:30,727 --> 00:13:33,630
-Don't try to be cute. -You should remove your lasses.

233
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,702

I won like this.

255
00:15:05,455 --> 00:15:08,124
-I won from you like this. -I didn't know she liked this sort of style.

Hang on. Hey. it wasn't on purpose,

00:22:06,776 --> 00:22:07,777
It really fell.

363
00:22:08,144 --> 00:22:11,748
-I told you not to wear it. -I won’t use it.

364
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:15,285

368
00:22:36,639 --> 00:22:39,275
Hey, stop it, stop it.

369
00:22:40,777 --> 00:22:42,278

Our team s too cool.

418
00:27:30,066 --> 00:27:32,802
Aren't we?

419
00:27:32,868 --> 00:27:35,071
Hey, I left without changing my shoes.

420
00:27:36,038 --> 00:27:37,106

421
00:27:37,707 --> 00:27:38,574

00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,135
Ah!

430
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:13,242
Hey, she's still smiling though.

431
00:28:13,376 --> 00:28:14,477
Hey, JI Won.

432
00:28:15,077 --> 00:28:18,547
Ji Won, I thought you fell off a cliff.

433
00:28:20,116 --> 00:28:21,450
I thought you fell off while bowling.

434
00:28:30,693 --> 00:28:31,927
Hyung, it’s like in manhwa.

435
00:28:32,028 --> 00:28:32,995
When she says "What do we do now?"

436
00:28:33,095 --> 00:28:34,764
"What do we do?" With both legs up.

437
00:28:34,864 --> 00:28:38,000
-Ji Won is... hey, Gary. -What do we do?

438
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,301
Let s do it quickly.

439
00:28:39,535 --> 00:28:42,471
If we do it quickly, we can still go first.

440
00:28:42,972 --> 00:28:44,774
Gary! That's right!

441
00:28:48,144 --> 00:28:49,645
That's right!

442
00:28:53,749 --> 00:28:55,384
That's it. Hey, that kid s still here.

443
00:28:57,553 --> 00:28:58,754
Oppa, hurry.

444
00:29:00,189 --> 00:29:01,657
Why is he taking so long?

445
00:29:02,591 --> 00:29:03,893
Let's go, let's go.

446
00:29:03,893 --> 00:29:04,694
Hurry!

447
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:06,862
Let's go. Hurry, hurry.

448
00:29:12,301 --> 00:29:13,769
-Oppa, fighting. -I got it,

449
00:29:13,769 --> 00:29:16,505
-Hyung, Its green! -Oh, it's green.

450
00:29:17,173 --> 00:29:18,274
It's so worn out.

451
00:29:18,541 --> 00:29:19,675
Just this once.

452
00:29:19,775 --> 00:29:21,977
Hyung, I got the feeling.

453
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:38,828
Just this once.

454
00:29:38,828 --> 00:29:40,663
Hyung, I got the feeling.

455
00:29:41,664 --> 00:29:43,499
Give me strength!

456
00:29:55,377 --> 00:29:57,847
Good, good!

457
00:29:58,981 --> 00:30:01,350
Good, good!

00:30:10,893 --> 00:30:13,095
Good, good!

459
00:30:38,154 --> 00:30:41,090
That's it! Truly, the green power.

460
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:43,392
Everyone, it's been hard on you.

461
00:30:45,094 --> 00:30:48,097
Truly, it's green. Ji Won, I'm green.

462
00:30:53,502 --> 00:30:57,807
-We did it all with green. -Hey Gary, we should do it with green.

463
00:30:58,274 --> 00:31:01,277
Isn’t Ji Won really like a heroine from a manhwa?

464
00:31:01,377 --> 00:31:03,579
-Yes, when she bounced around earlier. -Yeah, when she was bouncing around.

465
00:31:03,579 --> 00:31:06,182
It's my first time seeing someone jump like that.

466
00:31:06,382 --> 00:31:08,150
That’s how Ji Wonie umps.

467
00:31:08,150 --> 00:31:11,020
Also, did you see it earlier? I thought she fell off;a cliff.

00:31:14,323 --> 00:31:15,124
Over there!

469
00:31:15,124 --> 00:31:16,392
-Where? -There, on the left.

470
00:31:16,392 --> 00:31:17,960
There it is.

471
00:31:25,034 --> 00:31:26,702
This is the mission.

472
00:31:26,836 --> 00:31:30,439
The three teams will have a badminton battle and set off in the order of the results.

473
00:31:30,539 --> 00:31:32,374
We win the first one by default.

474
00:31:32,374 --> 00:31:34,376
Yeah, we win by default.

475
00:31:37,179 --> 00:31:39,982

Ok, good.

492
00:32:25,494 --> 00:32:27,229
That's it! That's the way!

493
00:32:27,429 --> 00:32:31,033
Referee, hang on. Time out, referee!

494
00:32:33,202 --> 00:32:37,039
Jo PD! Then; we can serve from here?

495
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:38,841
Here, using this method?

496
00:32:38,841 --> 00:32:43,145
What was that? I'll at least serve from here, this far back.

497
00:32:43,145 --> 00:32:44,947
I'm a person without the basic.

498
00:32:45,114 --> 00:32:45,748
Come here.

499
00:32:45,814 --> 00:32:47,483
That's not right.

500
00:32:48,984 --> 00:32:53,022
-Alright, so we can't do it this close. -Right. Make this line the limit.

501
00:32:55,958 --> 00:32:57,559
Defend after you serve.

502
00:32:57,826 --> 00:32:58,661
That’s it.

503
00:32:58,961 --> 00:32:59,828
That's it!

504
00:33:01,964 --> 00:33:02,965
That's it!

505
00:33:07,369 --> 00:33:08,637
Oh? It's here.

506
00:33:09,104 --> 00:33:10,372
0h? It's here,

507
00:33:12,174 --> 00:33:13,776
What, what?

508
00:33:14,176 --> 00:33:15,644
Look, she didn't touch it.

509
00:33:17,346 --> 00:33:19,081
Gaeko, I can’t see.

510
00:33:19,181 --> 00:33:20,249
Gaeko, I can't see.

511
00:33:20,482 --> 00:33:21,517
What's this?

512
00:33:25,821 --> 00:33:28,157
This... does this make sense?

513
00:33:29,458 --> 00:33:33,862
I know that Ha Ji Won is a very special guest, but...

514
00:33:41,904 --> 00:33:43,472
Oh, your eyes are so pretty.

515
00:33:43,572 --> 00:33:44,540
Oh. sexy.

516
00:34:00,389 --> 00:34:01,824
Hey, nice trick.

517
00:34:03,993 --> 00:34:05,761
It’s really jjang.

518
00:34:08,464 --> 00:34:11,667
Ji Won was a badminton player in junior high but she scores tisin this method.

519
00:34:14,036 --> 00:34:17,106
Hit it closer from below. Get closer.

520
00:34:17,172 --> 00:34:18,340
Go a little closer.

521
00:34:20,242 --> 00:34:22,511
-That's it. That's it. -Good, good.

522
00:34:22,745 --> 00:34:24,046
Out.

523
00:34:27,983 --> 00:34:29,051
One more point, one point.

524
00:34:30,619 --> 00:34:31,920
All of you et out.

525
00:34:32,321 --> 00:34:34,256
Get out. Not getting out?!

526
00:34:38,627 --> 00:34:40,429
It's our serve. Gary.

527
00:34:41,497 --> 00:34:42,531
The last one!

528
00:34:42,531 --> 00:34:43,532
Gary, fighting!

529
00:34:56,945 --> 00:34:58,180
Yeah.

530
00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:02,551
We won?

531
00:35:02,551 --> 00:35:04,153
Hyung, get out.

532
00:35:04,153 --> 00:35:07,156
Hey, its over. Hey, it's over!

533
00:35:07,322 --> 00:35:09,491
Your greed caused this!

534
00:35:29,144 --> 00:35:30,479
Fighting. fighting.

535
00:35:33,048 --> 00:35:34,583
Why are we so bad in badminton?

536
00:35:35,717 --> 00:35:36,885
Why are we so bad in badminton?

537
00:35:47,129 --> 00:35:48,964
-What were you doing? -Get out!

538
00:35:49,598 --> 00:35:50,499
What were you doing?

539
00:35:51,533 --> 00:35:53,235
Get out of here.

540
00:35:58,307 --> 00:35:59,374
Get out.

541
00:35:59,675 --> 00:36:00,843
Get out of here.

542
00:36:00,843 --> 00:36:02,444
Hey, but Gwang Soo...

543
00:36:04,046 --> 00:36:07,082
-Am I not a Running Man? -Hey. don't come into this area!

544
00:36:08,350 --> 00:36:09,985
I'm at loss for words.

545
00:36:10,119 --> 00:36:11,453
Don't come here.

546
00:36:12,688 --> 00:36:15,023
Don't even touch a strand of hair on my body.

547
00:36:15,023 --> 00:36:15,858
Good Job, Kim Jong Kook.

548
00:36:15,924 --> 00:36:16,792
Ready!

549
00:36:16,792 --> 00:36:18,994
Serve it to Gary hyun.

550
00:36:20,429 --> 00:36:22,197
-Good. -Leave it.

551
00:36:22,731 --> 00:36:25,100
-Good. -Leave it.

552
00:36:25,167 --> 00:36:28,670
-Yeah! -It touched, didn't he touch it?

553
00:36:34,643 --> 00:36:36,178
Didn't he touch it?

554
00:36:36,245 --> 00:36:37,746
Mr Gwang Soo's racket touched it.

555
00:36:37,746 --> 00:36:39,481
-It didn't. -Exactly, it touched.

556
00:36:39,481 --> 00:36:40,149
You sit down.

557
00:36:41,016 --> 00:36:43,952
Han on. Why are you doing this? I really didn't!

558
00:36:44,153 --> 00:36:45,187
Sit here for awhile.

559
00:36:45,287 --> 00:36:46,255
You sit here.

560
00:36:46,255 --> 00:36:47,055
Gwang Soo.

561
00:36:47,589 --> 00:36:50,325
Sit down, Just sit down for awhile. Just like that.

562
00:36:50,859 --> 00:36:51,860
What's this?

563
00:36:52,561 --> 00:36:56,698
The match between the Red Team and the Yellow Team's totally fascinating, they're not Joking.

564
00:37:00,702 --> 00:37:03,372
Are you ok, Mr Gary?

565
00:37:03,472 --> 00:37:04,907
Yes, I'm fine.

566
00:37:07,743 --> 00:37:11,246
Hey, you two, are like the leads from a high teen drama.

567
00:37:11,246 --> 00:37:13,015
I should have thrown my body at it.

568
00:37:26,562 --> 00:37:27,863
I'm sorry.

569
00:37:27,896 --> 00:37:29,631
The teamworks very good, it annoys me.

570
00:37:29,631 --> 00:37:32,401
If I do anything wrong please tell me any time.

571
00:37:32,768 --> 00:37:34,536
-Criticize each other's play, got it? -Yes.

572
00:37:34,603 --> 00:37:36,672
-Let me know if my playing Is unsatisfactory. -Please throw it over.

573
00:37:38,207 --> 00:37:41,376
Hey, don't come Into this area!

574
00:37:41,376 --> 00:37:42,978
Get out of here.

575
00:37:42,978 --> 00:37:44,546
Are you ok, Mr Gary?

576
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:46,248
Yes I'm fine.

577
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:50,352
-Our serve. -Ours?

578
00:37:52,821 --> 00:37:54,556
She's really pretty when so does that.

579
00:37:57,726 --> 00:37:59,361
Seriously, affecting our mental...

580
00:37:59,494 --> 00:38:02,264
Looking where to hit the ball to... so gorgeous.

581
00:38:04,666 --> 00:38:05,801
Oppa,

582
00:38:05,801 --> 00:38:06,969
Are you calling me?

583
00:38:08,804 --> 00:38:09,905
Are you calling me?

584
00:38:12,741 --> 00:38:13,642
Hey!

585
00:38:13,875 --> 00:38:14,943
Jeez!

586
00:38:17,879 --> 00:38:18,880
Hey!

587
00:38:19,047 --> 00:38:19,982
Jeez!

588
00:38:22,317 --> 00:38:24,386
You told me not to move, so I didn't move,

589
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:28,190
Hey, I'm the head of a badminton association!

590
00:38:29,191 --> 00:38:33,262
-Seriously... -Hyung. You told me not to move.

591
00:38:33,695 --> 00:38:34,696
He’s really petty.

592
00:38:35,130 --> 00:38:36,598
One Man!

593
00:38:37,032 --> 00:38:38,200
One Man!

594
00:38:43,905 --> 00:38:45,574
Don't be swayed.

595
00:38:45,674 --> 00:38:47,175
Hey, he's being swayed.

596
00:38:47,342 --> 00:38:48,644
He's having mental breakdown.

597
00:38:48,744 --> 00:38:50,545
Why are you so restless?

598
00:38:59,888 --> 00:39:01,356
One Man, out.

599
00:39:03,458 --> 00:39:04,826
One Man, out.

600
00:39:06,028 --> 00:39:07,095
One Man, out.

601
00:39:21,276 --> 00:39:22,344
They're really good.

602
00:39:28,050 --> 00:39:30,519
Why Is his face so red? Look.

603
00:39:33,789 --> 00:39:36,358
Hey, they're having a mental breakdown now.

604
00:39:36,358 --> 00:39:39,594
How can all of you be defeated Just by an 'oppa'? Aigoo. seriously.

605
00:39:39,594 --> 00:39:41,496
One Man and Oppa.

606
00:39:41,496 --> 00:39:43,498
-She's truly my woman. -She's truly charming.

607
00:39:44,433 --> 00:39:47,703
Jong Kook, you're too negligent.

608
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:51,306
You're a hole here,

609
00:39:51,506 --> 00:39:52,140
Hyung.

610
00:39:52,474 --> 00:39:54,142
Chairman, give me a chance,

611
00:39:54,843 --> 00:39:56,345
Hyung. Let him do it.

612
00:39:57,879 --> 00:40:01,683
-Then let Gwang Soo have two serves first. -Give it a try then. Go ahead and hit.

613
00:40:01,783 --> 00:40:06,088
President! President! Feel! Feel! Cross!

614
00:40:06,088 --> 00:40:10,192
-You stand here and hit, don't come over to my spot. -SukJin. h un became the ace!

615
00:40:10,192 --> 00:40:11,493
The ace!

616
00:40:11,793 --> 00:40:15,097
First time in my life I met someone so bad at badminton.

617
00:40:38,286 --> 00:40:40,655
With Jong Kook hyung out, they're winning!

618
00:40:40,655 --> 00:40:42,557
Well, because we can't say this has to do with skill.

619
00:40:42,557 --> 00:40:44,292
But Gwang Soo plays well?

620
00:40:46,495 --> 00:40:48,530
Hit first and we'll see.

621
00:40:49,264 --> 00:40:50,899
-It should have been like this earlier. -Well done!

622
00:40:50,899 --> 00:40:52,567
Our team is going to win.

623
00:40:57,939 --> 00:41:00,942
-Not bad! -We're catching up! We're catching up!

624
00:41:01,042 --> 00:41:02,444
Gwang Soo! Feel!

625
00:41:02,444 --> 00:41:04,446
Feel! Cross!

626
00:41:06,381 --> 00:41:09,050
Hyung! You should play with Ji Hyo later.

627
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,655
Now's the chance!

628
00:41:34,476 --> 00:41:35,677
What is this!

629
00:41:35,677 --> 00:41:38,079
Do it well![Must do it well!

630
00:41:51,393 --> 00:41:53,795
You’re forcing me to get into this.

631
00:41:53,929 --> 00:41:55,197
Should have caught It.

632
00:41:56,097 --> 00:41:57,432
Nice! Nice! Nice!

633
00:41:58,767 --> 00:42:00,135
Serengeti! Serengeti!

634
00:42:01,036 --> 00:42:02,571
Nice! Nice! That's it!

635
00:42:09,144 --> 00:42:11,179
Won! Won! Won!

636
00:42:15,550 --> 00:42:17,219
Time! Time! Time!

637
00:42:18,453 --> 00:42:20,655
Hyung, my stamina is now lacking.

638
00:42:21,256 --> 00:42:24,459
-Ji Won, you should drink some. You should drink some. -Thank you.

639
00:42:39,875 --> 00:42:42,244
Now, one more point. One more point.

Awesome. Really.

643
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:54,523
The three of us must end this.

644
00:42:54,589 --> 00:42:56,424
Fighting! Fighting!

645
00:42:56,424 --> 00:42:58,426
Serengeti! Serengeti!

646
00:43:06,234 --> 00:43:07,135
Get out.

647
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,455
Invincible Serengeti!

648
00:43:34,829 --> 00:43:36,631
We won!

649
00:43:37,198 --> 00:43:38,967
Seriously wasted.

650
00:43:42,404 --> 00:43:44,573
-President take it. -Okay.

651
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:47,676
-Myeongdong! Myeongdong! Myeongdong! -Okay!

652
00:43:48,843 --> 00:43:49,878
First place...

653
00:43:50,779 --> 00:43:54,382
Never thought that Hyung was so capable.

654
00:43:54,382 --> 00:43:58,987
-Everything is going well for us today. -Everythin is falling into place.

655
00:43:59,387 --> 00:44:01,222
Why didn't you say earlier?

656
00:44:03,658 --> 00:44:05,293
-Oh my... -Why?

657
00:44:05,293 --> 00:44:07,095
My face is no joke.

658
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:13,335
My face...

659
00:44:15,837 --> 00:44:18,206
The dark circles on my face are no joke.

660
00:44:18,340 --> 00:44:19,774
Mine is serious.

661
00:44:41,196 --> 00:44:43,531
High jump! High jump! High Jump!

662
00:44:47,102 --> 00:44:51,473
This is the competition place in Myeongdong where the high jump event will take place.

663
00:44:51,473 --> 00:44:55,343
In this event, will the Serengeti team be able to keep their lead? Let us wait and see.

664
00:44:55,343 --> 00:44:56,978
-How to do this? -How do we do this?

665
00:44:57,145 --> 00:45:00,682
-The sum of all three members' record must exceed 4m to succeed! -4m?! I can't do this...

666
00:45:00,682 --> 00:45:01,716
Why can't you?

667
00:45:01,716 --> 00:45:03,718
Jong Kook, this is your speciality right?

668
00:45:14,429 --> 00:45:15,697
4m? If it's 4m...

669
00:45:17,432 --> 00:45:18,600
lm.

670
00:45:18,633 --> 00:45:20,001
Im, 150cm.

671
00:45:21,703 --> 00:45:23,371
For us, he is 140cm.

672
00:45:23,405 --> 00:45:25,440
I'm 150cm, him 140cm, 110cm.

673
00:45:25,573 --> 00:45:26,875
I'm 110cm. Okay.

674
00:45:28,176 --> 00:45:30,745
Hyung. 150cm. 150cm. lm.

675
00:45:30,845 --> 00:45:32,547
150cm, 150cm, lm.

676
00:45:33,148 --> 00:45:35,050
I have no confidence.

677
00:45:35,250 --> 00:45:36,685
You still need to jump!

678
00:45:39,587 --> 00:45:41,723
We are 150cm, 150cm, lm.

679
00:45:43,058 --> 00:45:44,559
We have no other choice!

680
00:45:44,926 --> 00:45:46,661
Oppa! Can you see anything.

681
00:45:46,695 --> 00:45:48,496
Oppa fighting!

682
00:45:53,101 --> 00:45:54,402
Everybody!

683
00:45:58,573 --> 00:46:01,142
Hyung! Oh, this is what happened during the llsan competition!

684
00:46:08,049 --> 00:46:12,187
Woooooooo....

685
00:46:12,187 --> 00:46:13,221
Yah!

686
00:46:13,621 --> 00:46:14,723
Yah!

687
00:46:16,725 --> 00:46:17,992
Eeyah!

688
00:46:20,695 --> 00:46:22,263
I don't know if this will work.

689
00:46:30,572 --> 00:46:31,806
Where are you going?

690
00:46:32,974 --> 00:46:34,275
Where are you going?

691
00:46:37,245 --> 00:46:38,980
-What are you doing?! -I asked where are you going!

692
00:46:38,980 --> 00:46:40,882
-You gave me a big shock! -I asked where are you going!

693
00:46:41,049 --> 00:46:42,250
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

694
00:46:43,952 --> 00:46:45,186
Almost got in trouble!

695
00:46:46,921 --> 00:46:48,189
Fighting!

696
00:46:48,590 --> 00:46:49,858
Hyung, you can do it!

697
00:47:05,607 --> 00:47:06,341
Jumped over?

698
00:47:06,374 --> 00:47:09,677
Suave! Totally sexy! Totally sexy!

699
00:47:10,845 --> 00:47:13,081
-It's 150cm! -It's amazing!

700
00:47:13,181 --> 00:47:14,649
Why sexy?

701
00:47:14,783 --> 00:47:17,552
After watching this... it's touching.

702
00:47:17,585 --> 00:47:21,156
Wow! Best! Best!

703
00:47:21,322 --> 00:47:22,223
Gary!

704
00:47:27,595 --> 00:47:29,063
Must challenge, challenge.

705
00:47:29,164 --> 00:47:36,070
Kang Gary! Kang Gary! Kang Gary!

706
00:47:37,605 --> 00:47:41,209
Seriously! It's too hard! Hard!

707
00:47:41,209 --> 00:47:43,511
T's not even the Olympics!

708
00:47:43,511 --> 00:47:45,480
Why am I so nervous?!

709
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:47,048
This isn't anything serious!

710
00:47:47,048 --> 00:47:48,550
Calm down. Calm down,

711
00:48:02,297 --> 00:48:03,898
He hit his head.

712
00:48:04,132 --> 00:48:05,700
You re not embarrassed, right?

713
00:48:14,075 --> 00:48:15,176
What are you doing?!

714
00:48:15,176 --> 00:48:17,779
You do this well. Let's do rock paper scissors then.

715
00:48:17,779 --> 00:48:20,148
-What do you mean rock paper scissors? -I can’t.

716
00:48:20,148 --> 00:48:22,317
What do you mean you can't? Seriously!

717
00:48:22,617 --> 00:48:25,620
-You want me to jump lm 50cm? Now? -I don't care.

718
00:48:25,620 --> 00:48:29,090

He didn't even Jump,

755
00:50:50,565 --> 00:50:53,368

00:51:07,415 --> 00:51:10,518
No, no, hyung.

762
00:51:11,085 --> 00:51:12,820
Hey, come here, I'll tell hyung.

Forward?

767
00:51:22,163 --> 00:51:24,665
-Please decide, sideways or forward? -Forward. Go forward.

768
00:51:24,699 --> 00:51:26,300

Hey, if you couldn't even Jump over this then...

773
00:52:09,644 --> 00:52:12,713
He, our team the Serengeti's is really no joke.

774
00:52:13,247 --> 00:52:14,649
Why are we so good?

775
00:52:15,216 --> 00:52:17,051
They're giving this to us already?

776
00:52:18,853 --> 00:52:20,088
Ah, it's too easy.

777
00:52:24,992 --> 00:52:27,495
-Thank you, it's been hard on you. -Thank you very much!

778
00:52:32,066 --> 00:52:34,368
Hey, fortunately Suk Jin hyung jumped over.

779
00:52:35,203 --> 00:52:36,404
We never missed first place, right?

780
00:52:36,404 --> 00:52:38,406
-We've been first all the time. -Exactly.

781
00:52:38,406 --> 00:52:40,208
Let's just change our team name to First Place.

782
00:52:42,176 --> 00:52:43,978
We’ll start with Ji Won. 1 meter,

783
00:52:44,579 --> 00:52:45,880

-Challenge! -Challenge!

786
00:52:53,454 --> 00:52:55,156
Ji Won, be confident like earlier on.

787
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:07,335
We should have raised another 10 cm?

788
00:53:07,468 --> 00:53:09,203
Hey, she could do 1.2 meter.

789
00:53:11,272 --> 00:53:12,406

00:53:12,473 --> 00:53:13,975
-Fighting. -Fighting, Mr Gary.

791
00:53:14,075 --> 00:53:17,478
Gary, just like what you did earlier. It will be fine.

792
00:53:17,945 --> 00:53:19,247
What if I can't do it? That would be bad.

793
00:53:19,247 --> 00:53:20,481
I completely forgot.

794
00:53:21,015 --> 00:53:22,783
I'm having mental collapse.

795
00:53:22,884 --> 00:53:24,886
I hate this sort of tension so much.

796
00:53:24,886 --> 00:53:25,686
Challenge.

797
00:53:26,754 --> 00:53:27,722

00:53:33,060 --> 00:53:34,529
Oh, I'm going crazy.

800
00:53:40,735 --> 00:53:41,936
That's the way!

801
00:53:43,004 --> 00:53:44,705
That’s the way!

802
00:53:46,073 --> 00:53:47,575
Hyung, I've totally got it.

803
00:53:47,775 --> 00:53:49,777
I've totally got out.

804
00:53:50,678 --> 00:53:51,746
I'm the only one left.

805
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:54,382
1.50 m.

806
00:53:56,584 --> 00:53:58,586
Look, this is the centre portion.

807
00:54:00,621 --> 00:54:01,722
That's the bounciest part.

808
00:54:02,323 --> 00:54:03,491
I want to go to the toilet.

809
00:54:09,530 --> 00:54:11,132
Ji Won. I'm going crazy.

810
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:13,935
Ok, I'm going.

811
00:54:14,302 --> 00:54:15,636

815
00:54:24,579 --> 00:54:31,986
Clap, clap.

-Hey Ji Won. I’m really going crazy. -Go to the nearest gas station.

Ah, Gary...

831
00:56:09,617 --> 00:56:11,218
Are you sure you're fine?

832
00:56:12,053 --> 00:56:13,287
I'll drive.

833
00:56:13,421 --> 00:56:14,021
No, hyung is...

834
00:56:14,121 --> 00:56:16,657
Hyung, there’s a coffee cup back here.

835
00:56:17,591 --> 00:56:18,959
-Ji Won. -Yes?

836
00:56:20,227 --> 00:56:23,297
In the worst case scenario, just pretend you didn't see anything.

837
00:56:31,605 --> 00:56:34,975
Hyung, is it just my feeling that the driving bit rough?

838
00:56:35,576 --> 00:56:36,811
It's just your feeling.

839
00:56:36,911 --> 00:56:39,580
-I feel that the car is a bit rough, hyLing. -No, no.

840
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:41,649
I'm a bit uneasy.

00:57:21,288 --> 00:57:22,957
Hyung, aren't you embarrassed?

850
00:57:24,558 --> 00:57:26,394
Why can't I do this?

851
00:57:27,595 --> 00:57:30,030
T me Controller.

852
00:57:37,371 --> 00:57:39,273

his is the most tense moment during the game.

857
00:58:20,681 --> 00:58:22,516
Hey. this is too bouncy.

858
00:58:32,326 --> 00:58:34,028
Ji Hyo, we succeeded.

859
00:58:34,295 --> 00:58:35,963
We did it!

860
00:58:48,108 --> 00:58:51,745
Ah. I've gotten older after the high jump.

861
00:58:56,884 --> 00:58:59,653
Gaeko hyung, if you're tired I can drive too.

862
00:59:00,154 --> 00:59:01,388
I'm fine.

863
00:59:20,407 --> 00:59:21,809

00:59:22,276 --> 00:59:26,680
-Hyung, this really isn't a joke. -Usually, you'll et moregur ent as you reach the destination right?

865
00:59:26,680 --> 00:59:28,115
It's oscillating now.

866
00:59:36,957 --> 00:59:38,592
We're here.

867
00:59:41,729 --> 00:59:43,063
Let's go.

868
00:59:43,764 --> 00:59:45,266
Hey, this...

869
00:59:46,033 --> 00:59:48,369
What's this, doesn't it feel like a relay?

870
00:59:49,670 --> 00:59:50,471
What’s this?

871
00:59:52,172 --> 00:59:55,175

Locate the next runner, stick the name tag and pass the baton,

877
01:00:22,803 --> 01:00:26,774
When everyone has their name tags on. you can start tearing the other's name tags.

878
01:00:26,774 --> 01:00:31,478
But! If the baton carrier has his name tag torn off, the whole team is out.

879
01:00:31,478 --> 01:00:34,214
You need to protect the baton carrier.

880
01:00:34,214 --> 01:00:35,416
I'll be the first runner?

881
01:00:35,416 --> 01:00:37,017
Ok, you go first.

882
01:00:42,556 --> 01:00:44,058

01:01:30,804 --> 01:01:33,774
-Don't run too fast, it’s dangerous. -Alright.

01:01:56,964 --> 01:01:58,732
Hyung, this is long distance race.

898
01:01:58,966 --> 01:02:02,703
-The second runners are on the 6th floor! -6th floor?!

899
01:02:08,509 --> 01:02:11,812
-Gwang Soo's legs are too long! -Really long.

900
01:02:18,185 --> 01:02:19,687
I'm tired already.

901
01:02:20,854 --> 01:02:22,122
I can't run anymore.

902
01:02:28,896 --> 01:02:30,064
Where to?

903
01:02:30,230 --> 01:02:32,132
-Here, here! -Where, where?

904
01:02:59,326 --> 01:03:00,461
They are here, they are here!

905
01:03:00,461 --> 01:03:01,328
Really?

906
01:03:02,930 --> 01:03:05,365
-You have to find the name tag before the second baton carrier can run. -Ah, yes.

907
01:03:05,365 --> 01:03:08,268
-Where is it? I have to look for it? -Of course!

908
01:03:08,268 --> 01:03:10,370
You have to find it before you can continue!

909
01:03:12,706 --> 01:03:15,309
-He's so fast... -How did he come so fast?

910
01:03:15,776 --> 01:03:16,844
I'm touched!

911
01:03:17,211 --> 01:03:20,881
What's so touching about this?

912
01:03:20,881 --> 01:03:22,683
-I'm so touched! -Realiy?

913
01:03:23,984 --> 01:03:27,087
The name tag... where's the name tag?

914
01:03:31,158 --> 01:03:33,761
I think the name tag is in the editing room.

915
01:03:33,927 --> 01:03:34,862
They are here!

916
01:03:34,862 --> 01:03:37,197
Gwang Soo, find it quickly! Run!

917
01:03:37,297 --> 01:03:38,632
Giraffe, hurry up.

918
01:03:40,033 --> 01:03:41,335
Hey, this way!

919
01:03:42,369 --> 01:03:45,973
Gaeko hyung! Find my name tag!

920
01:03:45,973 --> 01:03:48,876
His name tag is so funny!

921
01:03:58,152 --> 01:03:59,319
I can’t...

922
01:03:59,486 --> 01:04:00,754
I won't find it...

923
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:14,835
I’m going crazy, really.

924
01:04:16,770 --> 01:04:19,173
Ah here! It's here!

925
01:04:26,680 --> 01:04:27,748
It's JI Won’s.

926
01:04:32,886 --> 01:04:33,887
Who is it?

927
01:04:34,254 --> 01:04:35,722
-Ji Won. -You found it?

928
01:04:35,722 --> 01:04:36,790
Ji Won...

929
01:04:37,457 --> 01:04:39,793
-Ji Won, let's go! -Ok, hand the baton to fier.

930
01:04:39,793 --> 01:04:45,299
Also. the 2 runners will go to the 9th floor to find the 3rd runner's name tag.

931
01:04:45,299 --> 01:04:46,733
-Alright, go! -I have to go too?

932
01:04:46,733 --> 01:04:47,534
Depart!

933
01:04:49,069 --> 01:04:50,103
I'm going crazy!

934
01:04:50,204 --> 01:04:51,505
We have to go outside.

935
01:04:55,709 --> 01:04:57,878
Ji Won. I'm sorry.

936
01:04:58,178 --> 01:04:59,513
Take the stairs.

937
01:05:01,215 --> 01:05:02,482
Be careful!

938
01:05:02,482 --> 01:05:03,951
Oppa is very tired right?

939
01:05:05,953 --> 01:05:07,821
Why is this so funny?

940
01:05:08,288 --> 01:05:09,857
Ji Won, I feel like dying.

941
01:05:10,557 --> 01:05:12,893
-Oppa, get a rest, I'll go look for it! -It s ok.

942
01:05:13,327 --> 01:05:17,865
This is not something that’s over after we find the name tag.

943
01:05:18,098 --> 01:05:19,766
We have to tear off the other s name tags.

944
01:05:19,766 --> 01:05:21,602
I'm going crazy.

945
01:05:45,425 --> 01:05:46,526
Oh, he found it!

946
01:05:51,832 --> 01:05:53,667
Quickly stick it on! Quickly stick it on!

947
01:05:55,335 --> 01:05:57,504
9th floor, 9th floor! Let's go, quick!

948
01:05:57,704 --> 01:06:00,374
We'll make a move first-

949
01:06:02,109 --> 01:06:04,845
Why is ours still not here yet? Why isn't Gwan Soo coming?

950
01:06:07,948 --> 01:06:08,649
Oppa!

951
01:06:08,649 --> 01:06:10,918
-Ji Hyo! -Oppa, we ll find it quickly and fetch you soon so please wait.

952
01:06:10,918 --> 01:06:13,387
-Hurry, hurry, hurry! -Hyung! Jae Suk hyung!

953
01:06:13,387 --> 01:06:15,122
It might also be outside!

954
01:06:15,122 --> 01:06:16,456
That's what I think too.

955
01:06:19,860 --> 01:06:22,129
Look around in the bushes!

956
01:06:28,068 --> 01:06:30,504
Found it! Found it! Found it!

957
01:06:30,504 --> 01:06:32,506
-Take a look to see whose is it! -You can't, Ji Hyo!

958
01:06:32,506 --> 01:06:35,075
-Oppa, let me take a look! -Ji Hyo. wait a sec.

959
01:06:36,176 --> 01:06:37,244
Gary!

960
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:41,515
Ji Won! Ji Won!

961
01:06:41,515 --> 01:06:43,216
Stay here! Ji Won!

962
01:06:44,318 --> 01:06:45,686
We did It.

963
01:06:45,719 --> 01:06:47,688
I found it! I found it!

964
01:06:55,996 --> 01:06:57,331
Ji Hyo. still nothing?

965
01:07:07,607 --> 01:07:08,775
I found it!

966
01:07:09,776 --> 01:07:12,412
-Haha! I found it! -Oh yeah!

967
01:07:12,846 --> 01:07:14,314
The team leader Indeed!

968
01:07:17,084 --> 01:07:22,155
Take note! If the person with the baton is out. the whole red team is out!

969
01:07:22,155 --> 01:07:23,223
You take this!

970
01:07:23,223 --> 01:07:26,093
-Alright get ready! -Shouldn't we make a strategy?

971
01:07:39,773 --> 01:07:43,910
-Oppa. let's go to the 13th floor. -Hey, this makes a sound when we walk through.

972
01:07:44,144 --> 01:07:45,278
Oppa, this is no joke.

973
01:07:45,278 --> 01:07:47,180
-Just brushing it off with something and... -Right, it’s going to fall off.

974
01:07:47,214 --> 01:07:51,918
Let's go to the 13th floor, and have a meeting first.

975
01:07:52,019 --> 01:07:52,953
Ok!

976
01:07:53,487 --> 01:07:55,088
Let s find and talk in somewhere bright.

977
01:08:02,462 --> 01:08:03,797
What, what!

978
01:08:04,798 --> 01:08:06,199
What, what!

979
01:08:10,504 --> 01:08:13,673
Hyung! I found the Blue Team!

980
01:08:13,673 --> 01:08:15,275
-Haha's team. -Go. go, go!

981
01:08:18,779 --> 01:08:20,013
Oppa, this is no joke!

982
01:08:20,013 --> 01:08:21,915
-Just brushing it off with something and... -Right, it's going to fall off.

983
01:08:21,915 --> 01:08:23,683
Let s go to the 13th floor...

984
01:08:33,527 --> 01:08:34,561
Oh! What?

985
01:08:34,961 --> 01:08:36,096
Oh, what?

986
01:08:39,933 --> 01:08:40,934
Oh, what's that?

987
01:08:48,375 --> 01:08:49,876
Gary! Rip it off quickly!

988
01:08:49,876 --> 01:08:52,145
-Gary! -Quickly rip it off!

989
01:09:03,390 --> 01:09:04,658
Gaeko out!

990
01:09:05,192 --> 01:09:06,393
Gaeko out!

991
01:09:22,476 --> 01:09:24,678
How do we find this?

992
01:09:28,014 --> 01:09:30,484
Hyung! Just now, inside there...

993
01:09:41,695 --> 01:09:43,363
They're coming, they're coming,

994
01:09:50,604 --> 01:09:56,576
Let's go quick. If someone attacks, don't just hide. Try to attack them and you will win!

995
01:10:10,690 --> 01:10:11,491
Hyung.

996
01:10:16,129 --> 01:10:20,934
-Hyung! We still haven’t found it yet! -You haven't found it?

997
01:10:20,967 --> 01:10:23,870
Why did you do that? You surprised me.

998
01:10:23,870 --> 01:10:25,605
You haven't found them?

999
01:10:28,074 --> 01:10:29,409
Hyung. Jong Kook hyung.

1000
01:10:29,676 --> 01:10:31,344
After we find it...

1001
01:10:31,411 --> 01:10:32,846
pretend we haven't found it.

1002
01:10:32,879 --> 01:10:37,217
Pretend we haven't found it, then attack Jae Suk hyung.

1003
01:10:39,085 --> 01:10:40,754
Let's do it. Ok.

1004
01:10:41,388 --> 01:10:42,622
Gwang Soo, is this it?

1005
01:10:44,925 --> 01:10:45,458
This?

1006
01:10:45,458 --> 01:10:46,927
This is it. Oh, ok.

1007
01:10:47,260 --> 01:10:49,763
It won't stick? Pull the sides.

1008
01:10:51,398 --> 01:10:52,933
-Hyung. -Yeah? - Stay here.

1009
01:10:52,933 --> 01:10:54,634
-Why? Why? -Stay here.

1010
01:10:58,672 --> 01:11:00,574
-We still haven't found it yet. -You haven't found it?

1011
01:11:00,674 --> 01:11:03,276
-Why did you do that? You surprised me. -You haven't found it?

1012
01:11:03,276 --> 01:11:04,878
-You haven't found him yet? -Yeah!

1013
01:11:04,978 --> 01:11:06,780
-You frightened me. -You haven't found it?

1014
01:11:06,813 --> 01:11:08,181
-Yeah, don't do this. -We're still finding it!

1015
01:11:08,215 --> 01:11:10,116
Hyung. our strategy's been exposed, let's go quickly.

1016
01:11:10,684 --> 01:11:11,952
Jong Kook, I'm sorry,

1017
01:11:11,985 --> 01:11:15,155
-No oppa, they found it already. -We didn't find it!

1018
01:11:16,356 --> 01:11:18,725
It was noona's tag in that box.

1019
01:11:18,992 --> 01:11:20,994
-We haven't found it yet! -Jong kook. I'm so,..sorry.

1020
01:11:21,228 --> 01:11:23,029
Oh, I was really shocked.

1021
01:11:23,730 --> 01:11:25,198
No, they found it.

1022
01:11:25,265 --> 01:11:26,733
-What do you mean we found it? -We didn't find it.

1023
01:11:27,067 --> 01:11:30,704
Then, if you haven't found it then let's tear it off once as a oke.

1024
01:11:31,104 --> 01:11:32,505
-What? -That's right.

1025
01:11:32,505 --> 01:11:33,907
-This kid? -That's right.

1026
01:11:34,007 --> 01:11:35,175
Why should I do that?

1027
01:11:35,609 --> 01:11:37,944
-Just for a joke. -Anyway if you didn't find it...

1028
01:11:37,944 --> 01:11:39,713
So that we’ll believe' you didn't find it.

1029
01:11:39,746 --> 01:11:42,082
-This kid's? -Then you can just leave as you please,

1030
01:11:42,415 --> 01:11:43,149
That's right.

1031
01:11:43,149 --> 01:11:44,251
-Tear it. -Really?

1032
01:11:44,251 --> 01:11:45,852
I'm really not it, I'm really not it.

1033
01:11:46,720 --> 01:11:48,822
Aligoo, aigoo.

1034
01:11:48,922 --> 01:11:49,689
See?

1035
01:11:49,689 --> 01:11:51,691
-We didn't find it. -Look at this kid.

1036
01:11:52,092 --> 01:11:53,526
I saw his eyes,

1037
01:11:53,560 --> 01:11:56,396
-Hyung, I saw Jong Kook hyung’s eyes. -You found it, right?

1038
01:11:56,429 --> 01:11:57,731
Why are you like this?

1039
01:11:58,031 --> 01:11:59,399
Hey Ji Won, move back, move back.

1040
01:11:59,466 --> 01:12:00,066
Me?

1041
01:12:00,100 --> 01:12:01,468
I can fight.

1042
01:12:03,436 --> 01:12:04,804
She says she can fight.

1043
01:12:04,871 --> 01:12:06,506
-Why do you want to fight? -What do we do?

1044
01:12:06,606 --> 01:12:07,574
Why do you want to fight?

1045
01:12:07,574 --> 01:12:09,409
Why did she say we're fighting?

1046
01:12:09,676 --> 01:12:11,845
We get along well, we get along great.

1047
01:12:12,545 --> 01:12:14,581
We re not really fighting now.

1048
01:12:14,814 --> 01:12:16,716
-No, no. -Let s not fight like this.

1049
01:12:17,284 --> 01:12:18,818
Leave first.

1050
01:12:24,324 --> 01:12:25,292
Come here, come here.

1051
01:12:25,358 --> 01:12:26,726
-Hey, what's going on? -Hyung.

1052
01:12:26,793 --> 01:12:27,394
Yeah.

1053
01:12:28,061 --> 01:12:29,663
-We almost got into trouble. -Why?

1054
01:12:29,896 --> 01:12:30,730
Huh, why?

1055
01:12:30,830 --> 01:12:35,702
When we came out. there seemed to be someone hiding there.

1056
01:12:35,769 --> 01:12:36,436
Who?

1057
01:12:40,106 --> 01:12:42,475
They found it. they found it right?

1058
01:12:51,818 --> 01:12:54,220
It would be great if I could rip it off from here.

1059
01:13:00,160 --> 01:13:02,228
I should have torn it earlier.

1060
01:13:04,364 --> 01:13:08,802
But, why We don't have any special abilities so why are you targeting us?

1061
01:13:08,935 --> 01:13:11,004
Just tell us, we won t ask anymore questions.

1062
01:13:11,805 --> 01:13:14,474
-What will make you believe us? -You have super powers right?

1063
01:13:16,076 --> 01:13:17,344
Should I go?

1064
01:13:22,582 --> 01:13:24,184
Can they see me from there?

1065
01:13:27,821 --> 01:13:31,291
-Just go and find it. -Stop giving us that look.

1066
01:13:31,958 --> 01:13:33,593
-I got it.. -Ah. seriously.

1067
01:13:44,003 --> 01:13:45,271
These people are seriously...

1068
01:13:45,372 --> 01:13:47,574
Hey. there seems to be one less member.

1069
01:13:47,574 --> 01:13:49,909
She's probably hiding somewhere.

1070
01:14:00,620 --> 01:14:03,523
Look, can't you see Miss Ji Won's red clothes?

1071
01:14:03,790 --> 01:14:04,724
Miss Ji Won!

1072
01:14:04,858 --> 01:14:05,492
Noona.

1073
01:14:08,695 --> 01:14:10,096
Miss Ji Won.

1074
01:14:11,231 --> 01:14:13,767
I'm asking Miss Ji Won why she’s hiding here now.

1075
01:14:15,935 --> 01:14:17,604
The staffs have gone out.

1076
01:14:23,009 --> 01:14:24,377
Hyung, we’ll find it as soon as possible,

1077
01:14:24,377 --> 01:14:26,546
-Find it quickly. -But to find it we have to leave here first.

1078
01:14:26,713 --> 01:14:27,714
We'll look for it.

1079
01:14:27,714 --> 01:14:30,016
-But, why are you coming here? -We've searched the other area,

1080
01:14:30,116 --> 01:14:32,218
Hyung, if it s not here then it s not on this floor.

1081
01:14:33,720 --> 01:14:34,788
Are you sure?

1082
01:14:34,888 --> 01:14:37,223
-Mr Ji Suk Jin doesn't have a nametag yet, you're sure? -That’s right.

1083
01:14:37,290 --> 01:14:38,458
-Seriously? -Of course.

1084
01:14:39,626 --> 01:14:40,894
You're serious?

1085
01:14:40,960 --> 01:14:42,796
-We're sure, it's not with us. -100% certain.

1086
01:14:42,929 --> 01:14:46,633
-If not, we have to start the fight now. -Exactly.

1087
01:14:46,699 --> 01:14:48,234
-Right? You're sure? -Yes.

1088
01:14:50,303 --> 01:14:52,505
-Why are you looking at me? -Hang on.

1089
01:14:52,872 --> 01:14:53,706
Oh?

1090
01:15:01,781 --> 01:15:02,682
Oh?

1091
01:15:03,450 --> 01:15:04,717
See this?

1092
01:15:05,285 --> 01:15:07,420
They’re alive, they're still alive.

1093
01:15:08,221 --> 01:15:09,122
Let's go.

1094
01:15:10,190 --> 01:15:11,191
Ah.

1095
01:15:16,062 --> 01:15:17,897
Hey. you're really jjang.

1096
01:15:18,998 --> 01:15:22,702
-This is seriously very disadvantageous for us. -What do we do?

1097
01:15:22,902 --> 01:15:24,003
Hey, firstly...

1098
01:15:24,103 --> 01:15:27,373
See? When they’re back with Suk Jin oppa. we can't do anything.

1099
01:15:27,407 --> 01:15:28,775
Suk Jin hyung won't go easy with the women.

1100
01:15:28,808 --> 01:15:31,744
This is bad. What do you guys do about this?

1101
01:15:43,490 --> 01:15:44,290
Hey.

1102
01:15:45,458 --> 01:15:47,193
You tore it? You tore Jae Suk's?

1103
01:15:47,427 --> 01:15:48,428
Ok, ok.

1104
01:15:49,095 --> 01:15:51,564
They ran off because we tore off Jae Suk hyung's.

1105
01:15:52,532 --> 01:15:53,233
Yes.

1106
01:16:10,116 --> 01:16:12,819
There. Over there.

1107
01:16:16,523 --> 01:16:17,924
They're over there right?

1108
01:16:18,992 --> 01:16:20,260
They 're over there right?

1109
01:16:33,006 --> 01:16:39,012
You all seriously work hard for our entertainment shows.

1110
01:17:01,234 --> 01:17:02,368
Hello.

1111
01:17:02,769 --> 01:17:03,770
Hello.

1112
01:18:24,517 --> 01:18:27,320
-Run! -What?

1113
01:18:32,458 --> 01:18:33,393
I tore it off.

1114
01:18:35,928 --> 01:18:37,797
Out. Team out!

1115
01:18:41,968 --> 01:18:44,103
Hey, should you hold on to this?

1116
01:18:45,838 --> 01:18:48,608
-The girls might be ail over me. -Fight, right.

1117
01:18:48,841 --> 01:18:50,710
It won't be easy for me to get away.

1118
01:18:51,844 --> 01:18:53,246
This important mission.

1119
01:18:56,716 --> 01:18:59,285
Hey, why are you wanderin off.

1120
01:18:59,986 --> 01:19:02,155
-The baton was with him? -Why didn't you look around?

1121
01:19:02,255 --> 01:19:04,190
Why didn't you look around?

1122
01:19:06,959 --> 01:19:10,930
Yellow Team, out. Yellow Team, out.

1123
01:19:19,372 --> 01:19:20,807
Yeah!

1124
01:19:21,274 --> 01:19:22,675
Yeah, Ji Won.

1125
01:19:22,942 --> 01:19:23,976
Yeah!

1126
01:19:25,445 --> 01:19:27,080
Wow, seriously.

1127
01:19:30,049 --> 01:19:32,585
Hey, I'm out because of you!

1128
01:19:33,152 --> 01:19:36,055
Why, why is it my fault again?

1129
01:19:36,289 --> 01:19:37,957
Because of you I died.

1130
01:19:39,692 --> 01:19:41,227
It just ended like this.

1131
01:19:46,132 --> 01:19:48,434
-What happened? -Hey, what...

1132
01:19:49,602 --> 01:19:51,804
Hey Ji Won, what happened?

1133
01:19:51,904 --> 01:19:52,739
What happened?

1134
01:19:52,772 --> 01:19:53,973
I did well.

1135
01:19:55,608 --> 01:19:56,576
Ah, you did well!

1136
01:20:01,013 --> 01:20:02,982
Hyung, you've worked hard.

1137
01:20:05,051 --> 01:20:05,952
You’ve worked hard.

1138
01:20:05,952 --> 01:20:08,654
Camera Director Kang Chan Hee will hand out the awards.

1139
01:20:10,389 --> 01:20:12,258
Oh, thank you, director.

1140
01:20:21,167 --> 01:20:22,268
Is this silver?

1141
01:20:22,502 --> 01:20:23,569
It's silver.

1142
01:20:23,569 --> 01:20:25,972
Hey, if you did a better job we could also get the gold now.

1143
01:20:26,038 --> 01:20:27,273
It's not platinum, right?

1144
01:20:28,708 --> 01:20:30,009
-Aigoo! -Wow.

1145
01:20:48,861 --> 01:20:50,797

1152
01:21:11,184 --> 01:21:13,119

1153
01:21:13,252 --> 01:21:14,687

01:21:14,887 --> 01:21:15,888
Oh, Yeon Woo.

1155
01:21:15,988 --> 01:21:17,757

1156
01:21:18,691 --> 01:21:21,327

1157
01:21:23,162 --> 01:21:24,030
Hey!

01:21:24,263 --> 01:21:26,365
Don't come any closer.

1159
01:21:26,566 --> 01:21:29,335
Even so...

1160
01:21:31,304 --> 01:21:33,206
Oh I'm really about to cry.
