00:00:08,693 --> 00:00:12,630
Hi. I'm Han Ga In. Let’s be friends.

2
00:00:12,997 --> 00:00:14,699
My first love...

3
00:00:14,699 --> 00:00:17,268
Actually. I wanted to go out with you...

4
00:00:20,604 --> 00:00:22,473
I think my memory is slowly coming back.

5
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:23,841
Is it not me, really?

6
00:00:23,908 --> 00:00:25,576
You're her first love...

7
00:00:25,609 --> 00:00:26,944
No more!

8
00:00:27,011 --> 00:00:29,814
Become my last love.

9
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:48,099
Today, we're at a school. A school.

10
00:00:48,199 --> 00:00:52,203
Ah, who will come out today?

11
00:00:52,303 --> 00:00:55,339
-Since we're at a school... -I am really curious about the guest.

12
00:00:55,539 --> 00:00:57,675
At this rate, we'll have Johnny Depp appear!

13
00:00:57,675 --> 00:01:01,012
-Eh?! -Johnny Depp!

14
00:01:01,178 --> 00:01:03,881
-Why would Mr. Johnny Depp come on this show? -Why not?! He could!

15
00:01:03,914 --> 00:01:06,751
-How would he come here? -He could, really!

16
00:01:06,784 --> 00:01:09,053
There’s a chance we could have a Hollywood star as a guest!

17
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:13,791
Fine, let's say Mr. Johnny Depp comes. 4 to 5 of us won't go 011 air that episode.

18
00:01:14,325 --> 00:01:17,695
If Johnny Depp comes, it means 4-5 of us won’t be on air.

19
00:01:17,795 --> 00:01:19,597
-We'll have to st ck by him. -Of course.

20
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:22,333
-And keep talking to him. -Like a ghost.

21
00:01:25,336 --> 00:01:27,638
-The guest is about to come out. -Oh really?

22
00:01:27,738 --> 00:01:29,573
-Is it Johnny Depp? -Today's guest, please come out!

23
00:01:42,953 --> 00:01:44,622
It looks like it's a too heavy.

24
00:01:44,889 --> 00:01:46,690
Who could it be that they're...

25
00:01:46,791 --> 00:01:49,393
Ah, they're too far away!

26
00:01:49,427 --> 00:01:52,029
-You should have started them out closer! -You haven't tried carrying a Gama, right? It’s incredibly heavy!

27
00:01:52,029 --> 00:01:53,697
Isn't this too much on them?

28
00:01:53,731 --> 00:01:56,801
-It‘s way too far! -It's too mean!

29
00:01:56,867 --> 00:01:59,437
-Those people must be... -There must be three people in them...

30
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:02,473
Ah, truly. Rest a bit my friends!

31
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:04,642
-Put it down! Put it down! -It's too much!

32
00:02:04,809 --> 00:02:06,477
It's a guy, a guy.

33
00:02:06,644 --> 00:02:07,812
Is it that heavy?

34
00:02:08,012 --> 00:02:10,147
Ah, everyone...

35
00:02:10,381 --> 00:02:12,683
This is heavy, See. Come this way.

36
00:02:12,917 --> 00:02:15,052
Ah, it's a flowered gama!

37
00:02:15,252 --> 00:02:16,454
A princess must be riding in it.

38
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:21,492
The guest is in one of these flowered gamas. Please choose one and stand In front of it.

39
00:02:21,525 --> 00:02:23,327
-Ah?! -I knew you would do this.

40
00:02:23,427 --> 00:02:26,597
-Yon become a team with the guest that comes out of the gama. -I heard a male voice on this side.

41
00:02:26,597 --> 00:02:27,898
When they put it down, he went "Oh! Oh!"

42
00:02:27,998 --> 00:02:30,334
This side did seem incredibly heavy.

43
00:02:30,367 --> 00:02:32,203
-No, this side was heavier. -They looked like they were holding something very heavy.

44
00:02:32,236 --> 00:02:34,839
-Are you sure? -You heard something?

45
00:02:36,407 --> 00:02:37,608
What do I do?

46
00:02:37,641 --> 00:02:38,909
This is maddening.

47
00:02:38,943 --> 00:02:40,411
Suk Jin hyung, it's definitely this side.

48
00:02:40,544 --> 00:02:41,846
Hey!

49
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:44,014
Hey!

50
00:02:45,182 --> 00:02:46,717
Hyung! Let me go!

51
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:49,120
-You can't go anywhere. -Suk Jin hyung, come to this side.

52
00:02:49,186 --> 00:02:51,255
-Yes, go to that side. Suk Jin hyug! -No, I don’t want to!

53
00:02:51,355 --> 00:02:52,990
You have to be a brand name, together with me.

54
00:02:53,057 --> 00:02:56,494
But like this, the number of people is too small on that side.

55
00:02:56,527 --> 00:02:59,530
-It didn't seem like a guy... -Starting with this side...

56
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:03,000
-Please ask for your person to come out. -Starting with us?

57
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,301
Ah, this is not good.

58
00:03:04,535 --> 00:03:06,937
-We got it wrong? -Can we change now?

59
00:03:06,937 --> 00:03:09,640
We must have gotten it wrong.

60
00:03:09,773 --> 00:03:15,279
We don't know who it is. but please, two female idols, please come out!

61
00:03:30,494 --> 00:03:32,029
Isn't that Dong Wan?

62
00:03:32,129 --> 00:03:32,997
Ah, really!

63
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:35,099
Hey, what are you doing?!

64
00:03:38,669 --> 00:03:41,372
-Gary! -Please come out!

65
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:54,685
Hello!

66
00:03:54,718 --> 00:03:56,487
-Oh! Ga in! -Hello!

67
00:03:59,056 --> 00:04:00,224
Yeon Woo!

68
00:04:00,724 --> 00:04:02,993
Yeon Woo!

69
00:04:03,727 --> 00:04:06,430
-Whoa, wait... -What! Yeon Woo...!

70
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:09,333
-Yeon Woo... Yeon Woo.,.! -It's Han Ga In?!

71
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,135
Hello-!

72
00:04:24,315 --> 00:04:26,383
-But you must be... -Han Ga In!

73
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:30,421
No. she's maiden Yeon Woo!

74
00:04:31,155 --> 00:04:33,190
Because I was so shocked...

75
00:04:34,358 --> 00:04:35,859
Hey, Gary hyung shrunk.

76
00:04:39,296 --> 00:04:42,700
And as I've said, in a circumstance such as Ga In’s...

77
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,003
-Hey! How is it Just "Ga In"?! -Oppa. again!

78
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:47,538
-Don't do that! -But, really..!

79
00:04:47,571 --> 00:04:51,742
-No one believes me! I even officiated her wedding! -It's true.

80
00:04:51,909 --> 00:04:54,345
We even did comedic skits together!

81
00:04:54,411 --> 00:04:57,348
-Well, at that time she must have been friends with Hwi Jae hyung! -True...

82
00:04:57,548 --> 00:05:00,584
With Hwi Jae... But Han Ga In, here...

83
00:05:00,618 --> 00:05:02,353
You usually don't come out on variety shows.

84
00:05:02,419 --> 00:05:06,090
I'm incredibly scared right now. Are there usually this many cameras around?

85
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:09,393
-I was completely surprised. -We're here, why be nervous?

86
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:10,828
Yes, that’s true.

87
00:05:10,928 --> 00:05:13,831
I couldn't sleep last night because I was so nervous.

88
00:05:14,632 --> 00:05:16,200
So the teams are split like this?

89
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:20,838
We should split teams like this, but because the teams are 3 vs 5,

90
00:05:20,871 --> 00:05:22,172
it's a bit disadvantageous.

91
00:05:22,273 --> 00:05:26,277
Ms. Han Ga In can choose one person from tills side.

92
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:30,114
Ah, hey!

93
00:05:34,051 --> 00:05:36,053
Hey, how could to do that Ga In!

94
00:05:36,053 --> 00:05:38,122
Ah, what is that?!

95
00:05:38,188 --> 00:05:41,058
Hey, is this something someone should do?!

96
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,928
Hey. don't do that.

97
00:05:45,296 --> 00:05:46,397
-Hey! -Okay.

98
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:49,300
Because my family was historically servants.

99
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,268
We do things like this well.

100
00:05:52,136 --> 00:05:54,438
Who should I pick?

101
00:05:54,505 --> 00:05:57,508
-Mr. Gary, I could you move a bit closer... -I can't get closer.

102
00:05:57,608 --> 00:05:59,276
Just let me stay here!

103
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:01,011
If you can’t get closer, get out!

104
00:06:01,078 --> 00:06:02,446
Why!?

105
00:06:02,446 --> 00:06:03,847
I don’t want to!

106
00:06:12,623 --> 00:06:13,891
I... Mr. Gwang Soo...

107
00:06:13,891 --> 00:06:16,560
-What did you say? -Mr. Gwang Soo.

108
00:06:16,727 --> 00:06:18,329
Mr. Giraffe!

109
00:06:21,098 --> 00:06:22,633
Ah, giraffe!

110
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:23,734
Yes!

111
00:06:23,834 --> 00:06:25,269
Giraffe!

112
00:06:27,538 --> 00:06:28,672
Giraffe? Me?

113
00:06:36,547 --> 00:06:38,349
It was a gut reaction.

114
00:06:38,382 --> 00:06:40,617
He's my sacrificing shaman!

115
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:42,753
In Running Man.

116
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:44,488
Why should I be sacrificing?!

117
00:06:44,555 --> 00:06:46,557
-He's mine. -Why do I need to be sacrificing?

118
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:49,460
-Why do I have to be sacrificing? -What do I do if he leaves?

119
00:06:49,493 --> 00:06:53,230
Then, unavoidably, hyung-nim, you will have to be the sacrificing person.

120
00:06:55,899 --> 00:06:59,536
Today's mission is to find your first love.

121
00:07:01,672 --> 00:07:04,775
All of you have lost your memories.

122
00:07:06,043 --> 00:07:10,147
We have to act?!

123
00:07:11,582 --> 00:07:15,452
-You want to create a drama now. -Were superpowers not enough?!

124
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:18,322
You can't remember right now, but

125
00:07:18,389 --> 00:07:25,329
as the missions progress, you will find clues for help you recall your first Jove.

126
00:07:25,829 --> 00:07:30,534
Through the race that starts now, you have to find the clues to find your memory's first love.

127
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:36,807
Yeon Woo!

128
00:07:38,275 --> 00:07:39,977
-You're her first love. -Hey!

129
00:07:41,378 --> 00:07:43,080
Actually, I want to go out with you..

130
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:46,083
Be my last love.

131
00:07:46,283 --> 00:07:47,851
It's’here,

132
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,989
But, where are going?

133
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:54,425
Why have we suddenly gotten onto a bus? It's weird.

134
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,435
It’s Budang.

135
00:08:04,468 --> 00:08:05,602
Ah, over there!

136
00:08:05,636 --> 00:08:06,904
-The Running Man banner, -Where? Where?

137
00:08:07,971 --> 00:08:09,173
In front here.

138
00:08:09,273 --> 00:08:10,741
-Let's get off. -Go out. go out.

139
00:08:14,545 --> 00:08:16,480
Where do we go?

140
00:08:17,314 --> 00:08:20,484
-The team that arrives first will do the mission first. Please go downstairs. -Hyung, come quickly!

141
00:08:20,517 --> 00:08:21,885
It's a team competition!

142
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:24,655
We all have to go? But where's the flag?

143
00:08:26,857 --> 00:08:28,792
-Which way? -Which way?!

144
00:08:30,994 --> 00:08:31,995
Where are we going?

145
00:08:33,096 --> 00:08:34,631
We have to get there first!

146
00:08:34,998 --> 00:08:37,034
My body can't move, hyung.

147
00:08:40,871 --> 00:08:41,505
What's this?

148
00:08:41,672 --> 00:08:42,806
Hula hoop?

149
00:08:43,774 --> 00:08:44,975
The Blue Team arrived first?

150
00:08:45,075 --> 00:08:46,977
-I got here first. -No. we did.

151
00:08:47,077 --> 00:08:48,679
Our whole team got here.

152
00:08:48,712 --> 00:08:52,216
This mission is a hint obtaining game.

153
00:08:52,349 --> 00:08:55,586
The name of this game is "the Moon that Pierces the Sun".

154
00:08:59,756 --> 00:09:01,525
-What did you say? -Seriously?

155
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:03,494
The missing moon, the piercing moon...

156
00:09:03,527 --> 00:09:05,395
How could you, in front of Ga In. so embarrassing.

157
00:09:05,429 --> 00:09:06,830
So it's Sun Piercing Moon? Sun Piercing Moon.

158
00:09:06,897 --> 00:09:08,932
We have to pierce the sun?

159
00:09:23,213 --> 00:09:25,249
-The Moon that Pierces the Sun... -Show us how to succeed!

160
00:09:25,249 --> 00:09:28,252
How is this "The Moon that Pierces the Sun"?

161
00:09:28,485 --> 00:09:30,821
-But who will throw? -But this is incredibly hard.

162
00:09:30,888 --> 00:09:33,490
-You have to do it all at once, right? -How do you throw that

163
00:09:37,294 --> 00:09:39,096
I can do this without jumping.

164
00:09:39,096 --> 00:09:40,497
Really?

165
00:09:42,199 --> 00:09:43,200
Try it.

166
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,735
Without jumping.

167
00:09:52,643 --> 00:09:54,177
Oh, how funny!

168
00:09:54,244 --> 00:09:55,812
Stand there.

169
00:10:12,896 --> 00:10:14,798
Gwang Soo, it was funny!

170
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:20,470
Ga In, have you done something like this before? You probably haven't done games like this...

171
00:10:20,938 --> 00:10:23,774
-When was the last time you... -During elementary school?

172
00:10:23,807 --> 00:10:25,609
So it's been more than 15 years?

173
00:10:27,678 --> 00:10:29,913
-Try rolling once... -Should l try to roll?

174
00:10:30,647 --> 00:10:32,616
To the front?

175
00:10:35,452 --> 00:10:37,955
-She does it really well, -Wouldn't it be easier to the side?

176
00:10:40,157 --> 00:10:42,326
But this game is too much!

177
00:10:42,392 --> 00:10:45,729
-It hurts a lot, doesn't it? -Ms. Ga In, don't use your head, just roll to the side.

178
00:10:45,729 --> 00:10:47,998
-To the side? -Yes. because if you use your head...

179
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:53,103
-Ga In, tie your hair well. You might be mistaken -for an understudy of a criminal.

180
00:10:55,606 --> 00:10:56,840
Fighting!

181
00:10:57,841 --> 00:11:00,844
One. two, three.

182
00:11:23,033 --> 00:11:25,002
Oh, Gwang Soo passed through?

183
00:11:34,811 --> 00:11:36,580
It's just too hard.

184
00:11:37,014 --> 00:11:39,583
Ah, come on people.

185
00:11:39,716 --> 00:11:43,353
Okay, if you just roll, it will be right on top of your heads.

186
00:11:43,453 --> 00:11:45,689
-You just have to go through. -That had better be true!

187
00:11:45,722 --> 00:11:49,860
Yeah! Get ready! One. two...!

188
00:11:49,893 --> 00:11:51,995
Okay. three!

189
00:11:54,531 --> 00:11:56,400
-Oh, it spread out well. -See, I told you!

190
00:11:58,301 --> 00:12:00,537
See, I told you!

191
00:12:00,971 --> 00:12:02,906
Why doesn't it come toward me?

192
00:12:04,841 --> 00:12:06,443
Just roll comfortably!

193
00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:09,513
When you get up... it won't be over your heads.

194
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:11,448
Gary!

195
00:12:11,548 --> 00:12:13,717
Should I roll to the side, instead of like this?

196
00:12:14,051 --> 00:12:16,119
Is this faster?

197
00:12:16,219 --> 00:12:18,221
-Okay! -Is this faster?

198
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:23,226
Ga In, what are you doing by yourself?

199
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:25,328
Did I see incorrectly?

200
00:12:25,395 --> 00:12:26,930
What are you doing by yourself?

201
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:28,532
It looked like you just rolled sideways?

202
00:12:28,699 --> 00:12:30,400
I'm practising rolling...

203
00:12:30,467 --> 00:12:33,737
Ms. Ga In. it depends on your left or right leg. If you use your right leg, do this.

204
00:12:33,737 --> 00:12:37,274
Then just do this. Put your hand down like this, and roll just like this.

205
00:12:37,274 --> 00:12:40,510
How could Ga In roll like you do?

206
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:42,212
See. she just did! It's gotten a lot better!

207
00:12:42,245 --> 00:12:45,215
-How can she roll like you? -She just did this!

208
00:12:45,215 --> 00:12:47,718
No, that's not it!

209
00:12:47,718 --> 00:12:52,556
Just push yourself straight. Without using your head.

210
00:12:53,223 --> 00:12:55,325
-Using your shoulder. -Look at her hair!

211
00:12:55,392 --> 00:12:56,860
I'm sorry.

212
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:04,935
Yang Myeong-gun!

213
00:13:05,035 --> 00:13:06,870
Yang Myeong-gun.

214
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:13,143
How could you make the guest's hair like this?

215
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:15,445
You're making it more...

216
00:13:15,479 --> 00:13:17,280
You're creating static!

217
00:13:18,682 --> 00:13:20,617
We called over a top star and...!

218
00:13:20,684 --> 00:13:22,152
Stop it!

219
00:13:25,188 --> 00:13:27,624
Let's do a cheer!

220
00:13:27,891 --> 00:13:29,159
-Yes, hyung! -Since Ga In is here and all.

221
00:13:29,192 --> 00:13:30,527
-Our cheer is ready, right? -Yes!

222
00:13:30,594 --> 00:13:34,631
Two three! Han Ga In Is a star that does one thing!

223
00:13:37,868 --> 00:13:40,771
Han Ga In isn't, Han Ga In isn't a idle star

224
00:13:40,804 --> 00:13:44,875
Pierce the sun and run! Sun piercing moon! Sun piercing moon!

225
00:13:47,277 --> 00:13:50,180
It's so embarrassing. I can't bear it!

226
00:13:50,981 --> 00:13:52,783
So embarrassing!

227
00:13:53,383 --> 00:13:55,886
Ga In, it was because I hadn't seen you so long and I was so happy...

228
00:13:58,155 --> 00:13:59,790
Okay, I'm going!

229
00:14:00,023 --> 00:14:01,424
One!

230
00:14:02,092 --> 00:14:03,627
Two!

231
00:14:03,994 --> 00:14:05,328
Three!

232
00:14:07,531 --> 00:14:08,331
Three!

233
00:14:13,303 --> 00:14:15,105
It was all for Han Ga In.

234
00:14:16,673 --> 00:14:18,208
She's the only one.

235
00:14:18,275 --> 00:14:20,544
By herself!

236
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:22,879
We'll show you what a real cheer is!

237
00:14:23,213 --> 00:14:24,981
Let's do this elegantly. Elegantly,

238
00:14:25,115 --> 00:14:28,985
Commander! Big Nose! Ace Haroro!

239
00:14:29,019 --> 00:14:34,057
We four have gathered to p erce the sun! Sun Piercing Moon!

240
00:14:34,891 --> 00:14:36,993
Sun Piercing Moon!

241
00:14:44,201 --> 00:14:46,069
And what's this...

242
00:14:46,303 --> 00:14:48,672
Why don't you just pierce my frustration.

243
00:14:49,773 --> 00:14:52,676
Don't pierce the sun. just pierce my frustration.

244
00:14:53,276 --> 00:14:55,111
Hey!

245
00:14:58,982 --> 00:15:01,418
One, two three!

246
00:15:03,453 --> 00:15:04,855
Two, three!

247
00:15:20,136 --> 00:15:22,372
Can't Jong Kook hyung throw for us. too?

248
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,442
They just need to sit still.

249
00:15:25,442 --> 00:15:27,177
Ah. it was so close.

250
00:15:27,477 --> 00:15:29,646
I wore white pants for nothing.

251
00:15:31,448 --> 00:15:33,550
You should have let us know earlier.

252
00:15:34,951 --> 00:15:37,420
My white pants have become stained with grass and are now green.

253
00:15:37,454 --> 00:15:39,589
Hey! If it's green, you can give it to Jae Suk hyung.

254
00:15:39,623 --> 00:15:42,559
-Hey! Not all green stuff is mine! -That's what you can do!

255
00:15:42,626 --> 00:15:44,194
Let's switch these, too.

256
00:15:44,227 --> 00:15:45,795
Hey!

257
00:15:45,795 --> 00:15:47,397
It might be because of that.

258
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:49,733
Do it with the power of green, hyung!

259
00:15:49,799 --> 00:15:53,436
Okay. Gwang Soo, you have to come toward the middle.

260
00:15:53,837 --> 00:15:55,672
One.

261
00:15:56,239 --> 00:15:57,908
Two.

262
00:15:58,842 --> 00:16:00,076
Three!

263
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:02,178
Three!

264
00:16:09,119 --> 00:16:11,288
Lease become a couple with me!

265
00:16:11,588 --> 00:16:13,657
You must play like this at home usually.

266
00:16:15,492 --> 00:16:17,527
Is that something you say to someone?

267
00:16:17,627 --> 00:16:19,296
How could you say that she plays like this at home usually?

268
00:16:19,396 --> 00:16:20,430
Because she's so good at it.

269
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:22,832
-How could she do this with Mr, Jeong Hun? -The two of them could.

270
00:16:23,033 --> 00:16:24,701
And with Mr. Kyu Jin!

271
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:26,670
How could they do this at home?

272
00:16:26,736 --> 00:16:29,072
-Hey, apologize! -Gwang Soo, apologize.

273
00:16:29,372 --> 00:16:31,107
I'm sorry.

274
00:16:32,943 --> 00:16:36,880
Look at maiden Yeon Woo.

275
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:39,215
-She's become an understudy for a criminal. -Exactly.

276
00:16:39,549 --> 00:16:41,284
Ah. this is really...

277
00:16:43,386 --> 00:16:45,322
Wash your hair in the stream.

278
00:16:45,422 --> 00:16:47,691
Is that something you should say?!

279
00:16:48,491 --> 00:16:50,393
How could you say to maiden Yeon Woo to wash her hair in the stream?!

280
00:16:50,493 --> 00:16:52,829
Because her hair is like that. I felt sorry for her.

281
00:16:53,129 --> 00:16:55,498
The most important thing is

282
00:16:55,632 --> 00:16:58,568
rolling quickly, looking for it, and following it.

283
00:16:58,702 --> 00:17:01,104
-Ji Hyo, so leave the last one for me. -Okay.

284
00:17:03,173 --> 00:17:04,074
Promise me!

285
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:08,345
Okay, I’m going. One, two. three!

286
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:23,660
Oh. success!

287
00:17:26,329 --> 00:17:27,831
Success!

288
00:17:33,103 --> 00:17:36,673
Big Nose! Ace! Haroro! Commander!

289
00:17:36,773 --> 00:17:39,609
We four gathered... sun... Yah!

290
00:17:43,246 --> 00:17:47,984
But this time, like Jong Kook said, this time. they rolled and it was right on top of them.

291
00:17:48,084 --> 00:17:49,019
How did that work?

292
00:17:49,052 --> 00:17:52,956
-This time, it was true. They lift ed their heads, and it was right there. -How does he do that...

293
00:17:52,956 --> 00:17:55,025
The succeeding team, please come here.

294
00:17:55,058 --> 00:18:01,631
You can take the bus you arrived on and go to the final location comfortably.

295
00:18:01,798 --> 00:18:04,734
And there's a hint here.

296
00:18:04,734 --> 00:18:08,638
You will find clues about your first love if you look for 'picture diaries'.

297
00:18:08,805 --> 00:18:12,876
You will find clues about your first love if you look for 'picture diaries'.

298
00:18:16,379 --> 00:18:18,782
Gary, let's do this well this time!

299
00:18:20,417 --> 00:18:23,186
One, two, three!

300
00:18:25,255 --> 00:18:26,556
Three!

301
00:18:36,199 --> 00:18:37,200
Success!

302
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,702
-You have to see this as passed. -Pass it through your head. quickly!

303
00:18:39,969 --> 00:18:42,705
Success!

304
00:18:49,612 --> 00:18:52,816
-Immediately! -We did it!

305
00:18:52,882 --> 00:18:54,751
-It went right in. -They just succeeded!

306
00:18:54,818 --> 00:18:57,954
-No way. How? -They did?

307
00:18:58,021 --> 00:18:59,355
Please give us the mission.

308
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:03,827
Because you lost, at the next location

309
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:06,296
you won't get a hint.

310
00:19:06,296 --> 00:19:08,598
Only the winning team gets that.

311
00:19:08,698 --> 00:19:14,871
And, you can't use that bus we used before. You must go on your own somehow.

312
00:19:14,938 --> 00:19:17,340
-Go! -Can we use something? Like a cellphone?

313
00:19:17,841 --> 00:19:21,277
-Can we use our ce p ones -You're going to ride there on your cellphone?

314
00:19:21,311 --> 00:19:23,913
-No..! -Sure, why not!

315
00:19:23,947 --> 00:19:25,715
I'll ride it there!

316
00:19:25,815 --> 00:19:28,384
Oppa. I think I understand why you do that now.

317
00:19:29,119 --> 00:19:30,453
You see now, don't you?

318
00:19:32,956 --> 00:19:34,924
-Ga In, you see, don't you? -But that's not...

319
00:19:34,991 --> 00:19:36,793
Why we're like this.

320
00:19:37,594 --> 00:19:39,429
Hey, heyThey!

321
00:19:39,496 --> 00:19:41,197
Let's go. let's go, let's go!

322
00:19:42,899 --> 00:19:44,033
Oppa.

323
00:19:44,234 --> 00:19:46,169
Search for a picture diary?

324
00:19:46,336 --> 00:19:47,637
A picture diary?

325
00:19:47,737 --> 00:19:50,206
Wasn't there something called a picture diary, a book, in the past?

326
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,342
-During elementary school... -When we were young, during elementary school!

327
00:19:52,375 --> 00:19:54,944
-It's the thing where you draw on top and write on the bottom. -Yeah, the one where you write.

328
00:19:54,944 --> 00:19:58,047
Ah. we're going back to our childhood. But what is this first love?

329
00:19:58,248 --> 00:20:00,116
Oppa, over there! There's the Running Man banner.

330
00:20:00,216 --> 00:20:03,953
H-hey. I think it's here. We must be going to this building.

331
00:20:05,588 --> 00:20:06,890
Thank you.

332
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:08,825
-Ah, where is this? -It's this way.

333
00:20:08,892 --> 00:20:11,327
A job world!

334
00:20:11,995 --> 00:20:13,730
-Oh. Running Man..! -It says Running Man!

335
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:15,832
Let's go in. oppa!

336
00:20:16,099 --> 00:20:17,534
Oh, it does.

337
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,414
What's this?

338
00:20:31,681 --> 00:20:33,116
Are we having a race here?

339
00:20:33,183 --> 00:20:34,751
Hey, there's something here.

340
00:20:35,952 --> 00:20:37,620
Will you be giving us something again?

341
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:40,123
Yes. this is Job World.

342
00:20:41,157 --> 00:20:43,326
It's an individual competition.

343
00:20:44,594 --> 00:20:45,728
Individual competition?

344
00:20:45,795 --> 00:20:48,097
-But we came in so friendly... -Individual competition isn't good...

345
00:20:48,198 --> 00:20:51,434
But you have a very Important hint.

346
00:20:52,569 --> 00:20:54,437
There must be someone!

347
00:21:02,078 --> 00:21:05,915
This is your childhood. The one yon can't remember very well.

348
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:09,686
-Who is this? -Gary's too pretty!

349
00:21:09,852 --> 00:21:11,988
Why is Gary so pretty?

350
00:21:13,256 --> 00:21:15,625
From now, it's an individual competition.

351
00:21:17,727 --> 00:21:19,128
Individual competition?

352
00:21:19,629 --> 00:21:22,332
Because you lost, you do not get the hinf.

353
00:21:22,398 --> 00:21:24,534
As I said in the morning,

354
00:21:25,368 --> 00:21:27,503
there's something about this.

355
00:21:48,858 --> 00:21:52,128
Hey. hey. hey. Quiet. Go to your seats.

356
00:21:52,195 --> 00:21:53,529
Quickly, to your seats.

357
00:21:56,699 --> 00:21:58,201
Song JI Hyo. shush.

358
00:21:59,802 --> 00:22:01,537
Attention.

359
00:22:02,505 --> 00:22:06,709
Hey kids, today we'll have a new friend transferring in from Seoul.

360
00:22:06,843 --> 00:22:09,312
Shall we call our friend?

361
00:22:09,345 --> 00:22:11,314
Hey, Ga In! Come in!

362
00:22:28,197 --> 00:22:31,801
Here. here. Ga In. How pretty you are.

363
00:22:31,901 --> 00:22:34,337
Isn't Ga In pretty?

364
00:22:34,570 --> 00:22:37,407
Han Ga In, become my last love.

365
00:22:37,774 --> 00:22:40,576
Hey! Hey! Hey!

366
00:22:42,545 --> 00:22:43,780
Ga In, greet everyone.

367
00:22:43,846 --> 00:22:48,084
Hi, nice to meet you. I'nrHan Ga In. Let's be friends.

368
00:22:48,117 --> 00:22:50,320
Do you happen to know Kim Soo Hyun?

369
00:22:50,853 --> 00:22:53,323
She looks familiar. I've seen her often before.

370
00:22:53,423 --> 00:22:56,459
Now, who would like to sit with Ga In?

371
00:22:56,526 --> 00:22:58,928
-Me. me. me. me. -Hey!

372
00:22:59,095 --> 00:23:00,897
Today's Monday!

373
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:02,598
Oh my god.

374
00:23:02,699 --> 00:23:04,701
Stress.

375
00:23:05,301 --> 00:23:08,504
-The seat next to me is empty. Do you want to sit here? -Ga In, that seat is empty.

376
00:23:08,538 --> 00:23:10,139
Go sit over there.

377
00:23:13,676 --> 00:23:16,646
Now, everyone, face forward.

378
00:23:16,813 --> 00:23:18,815
We need to start class.

379
00:23:18,848 --> 00:23:21,451
Now, let's start class!

380
00:23:21,517 --> 00:23:24,187
Shall we take attendance to see if everyone is here?

381
00:23:24,387 --> 00:23:26,389
-Song Ji Hyo! -Here!

382
00:23:26,389 --> 00:23:30,226
-You've come. Next, Kim Jong Kook! -Here!

383
00:23:30,259 --> 00:23:32,295
-Yoo Jae Suk! -Here!

384
00:23:32,395 --> 00:23:34,330
-HaHa! -Here!

385
00:23:34,397 --> 00:23:35,998
Lee Gwang Soo?

386
00:23:36,299 --> 00:23:38,801
Hey kid, you're Lee Gwang Soo!

387
00:23:39,535 --> 00:23:42,171
-Here! -Good!

388
00:23:42,305 --> 00:23:43,940
Ji Suk Jin!

389
00:23:56,953 --> 00:23:58,788
Ah, really? First love?

390
00:23:59,355 --> 00:24:01,524
Not meeting your first love is best.

391
00:24:01,924 --> 00:24:04,794
You're not supposed to meet your first love.

392
00:24:23,346 --> 00:24:25,648
I need to find picture diaries.

393
00:24:26,482 --> 00:24:28,751
Let's search for clues.

394
00:24:29,185 --> 00:24:31,120
Finding that is the most important.

395
00:24:32,555 --> 00:24:38,928
Perhaps Gary hyung and Ji Hyo... Maybe Monday Couple are first loves?

396
00:24:40,530 --> 00:24:41,898
It couldn’t be, right?

397
00:24:42,532 --> 00:24:44,000
That's right!

398
00:24:46,636 --> 00:24:51,207
It's like finding a needle in a haystack. How do they want us to find this without anything?

399
00:24:51,274 --> 00:24:53,242
In this wide place.

400
00:25:00,149 --> 00:25:01,350
Go Quickly.

401
00:25:01,584 --> 00:25:02,985
Heey.

402
00:25:12,495 --> 00:25:14,197
Ms. Harr Ga In.

403
00:25:19,068 --> 00:25:24,674
Acfually. you're the protagonist of this first love story.

404
00:25:30,146 --> 00:25:33,950
Because you and the other members have amnesia.

405
00:25:33,983 --> 00:25:36,219
No oneknows vvho loved who.

406
00:25:36,219 --> 00:25:39,722
But there definitely was someone yon loved in your past.

407
00:25:39,856 --> 00:25:41,624
Within these members.

408
00:25:41,691 --> 00:25:45,194
Because you lost in the game, we can't tell you what you should be searching for.

409
00:25:45,294 --> 00:25:48,598
But if you gather those hints and order them chronologically.

410
00:25:48,698 --> 00:25:51,267
You will find who your first love was.

411
00:25:51,334 --> 00:25:52,802
Chronologically?

412
00:25:52,869 --> 00:25:58,774
You must first find your first love before the other members do.

413
00:25:58,808 --> 00:25:59,575
Yes.

414
00:25:59,575 --> 00:26:03,312
Then. if you find your first love, with your first love,

415
00:26:03,379 --> 00:26:07,216
tear off the name tags of the remaining five members and go to the final location.

416
00:26:07,283 --> 00:26:10,353
And those hints are... in here?

417
00:26:10,453 --> 00:26:12,321
They are hidden in various places.

418
00:26:33,042 --> 00:26:34,844
-Hey. Gwang Soo! -Hyung!

419
00:26:35,478 --> 00:26:37,780
You're just walking around without knowing anything, too, right?

420
00:26:37,914 --> 00:26:39,048
Yes.

421
00:26:40,049 --> 00:26:42,385
Hyung, you know it's defin tely in places like this, right?

422
00:26:45,488 --> 00:26:46,889
Oh? Wow.

423
00:26:47,857 --> 00:26:50,693
But what's the hint? What does it look like?

424
00:26:52,028 --> 00:26:53,029
Wow!

425
00:26:53,229 --> 00:26:55,097
Wow, this place is amazing.

426
00:26:55,398 --> 00:26:57,199
Can we sit here?

427
00:26:58,668 --> 00:27:00,136
Hey, Gwang Soo.

428
00:27:00,202 --> 00:27:01,904
Wow, this is no joke.

429
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,275
Wow, it really looks like this? Whoa.

430
00:27:07,143 --> 00:27:08,311
Co-pilot!

431
00:27:08,344 --> 00:27:10,813
Can't I be the captain?

432
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:17,253
-Wow, you can hear it, too! -You do this.

433
00:27:17,753 --> 00:27:21,490
Passengers, Running Air is taking off.

434
00:27:22,458 --> 00:27:25,494
All passengers are toiplease put on their seat belts.

435
00:27:26,228 --> 00:27:27,330
Now?

436
00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:31,334
-I've always wanted to say this. -Put your mic up first.

437
00:27:31,434 --> 00:27:34,971
But you shouldn't have put that in my mouth still!

438
00:27:42,712 --> 00:27:44,447
We pologize.

439
00:27:44,513 --> 00:27:46,949
There will be some turbulence.

440
00:27:47,049 --> 00:27:49,151
There will be more turbulence than anticipated.

441
00:27:50,553 --> 00:27:53,689
No matter what anyone says. Korea's yeonjigonji is the best.

442
00:27:55,491 --> 00:27:59,028
There was something like this too. Hiding.

443
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:06,035
Fly! Fly!

444
00:28:07,703 --> 00:28:11,574
She was so pretty-

445
00:28:12,375 --> 00:28:16,479
Ji Suk Jin, out! Ji Suk Jin, out!

446
00:28:17,313 --> 00:28:20,416
We will end the news here.

447
00:28:22,685 --> 00:28:24,153
Ah, really.

448
00:28:26,656 --> 00:28:29,125
The picture diary is...

449
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:32,528
What is this?

450
00:28:33,195 --> 00:28:34,697
Somewhere like this...

451
00:28:34,997 --> 00:28:37,700
Somewhere like this is a good hiding place!

452
00:28:41,604 --> 00:28:42,838
Wow, here...

453
00:28:43,706 --> 00:28:45,541
I should bring my child... Oh?!

454
00:28:46,876 --> 00:28:47,843
Oh?!

455
00:28:50,212 --> 00:28:52,014
Didn't I find this too quickly?

456
00:28:52,114 --> 00:28:53,015
Huh?

457
00:28:55,384 --> 00:28:57,286
I finally found one.

458
00:29:06,529 --> 00:29:09,999
"During the talent show, everyone danced together."

459
00:29:10,599 --> 00:29:15,237
"♥♥ danced the best. He was like a celebrity." He dances well...

460
00:29:27,483 --> 00:29:30,553
When I grow up, I'm going to become a legendary dancer!

461
00:29:33,789 --> 00:29:36,726
Ah Definitely. Yoo Hyuk is the best at dancing!

462
00:29:36,759 --> 00:29:39,228
Hey, who do you think is the coolest?

463
00:29:39,295 --> 00:29:40,496
Me?

464
00:29:40,529 --> 00:29:43,199
Um. I... I... Him!

465
00:29:53,809 --> 00:29:55,211
He dances well?

466
00:29:57,446 --> 00:29:59,048
I can't dance well...

467
00:30:00,850 --> 00:30:02,218
Who dances well?

468
00:30:02,585 --> 00:30:03,886
Yoo Hyuk?

469
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:06,622
Is it Yoo Hyuk?

470
00:30:09,692 --> 00:30:11,427
Jong Kook dances well, too...

471
00:30:11,427 --> 00:30:13,429
HaHa, too. Gary.

472
00:30:18,167 --> 00:30:19,769
Ah, so frustrating.

473
00:30:20,302 --> 00:30:22,171
I have to find something?

474
00:30:25,775 --> 00:30:27,443
What do I have to find?

475
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:34,683
-Ga In, did you mind something? -No.

476
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:36,652
They won't tell me.

477
00:30:36,752 --> 00:30:38,320
-You haven't found anything yet? -Yes.

478
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:40,389
-Did you find something, oppa? -No, I haven't.

479
00:30:40,422 --> 00:30:42,224
Oh, it seems like you found something.

480
00:30:42,291 --> 00:30:44,527
Your gaze is wavering.

481
00:30:45,327 --> 00:30:47,329
I was only taking this out.

482
00:30:47,396 --> 00:30:48,998
No, I think there's something strange.

483
00:30:48,998 --> 00:30:50,399
No, there's not!

484
00:30:50,699 --> 00:30:53,002
-You know something, don't you? -No. I don't.

485
00:30:53,402 --> 00:30:55,805
I really don’t! You think I would do this, Ga In?

486
00:30:57,239 --> 00:31:00,009
-If I knew, I'd tell you. -Then why'd you ask if I had found something?

487
00:31:00,109 --> 00:31:01,544
Ga In, you're...

488
00:31:06,482 --> 00:31:08,350
I think I have to keep searching.

489
00:31:10,486 --> 00:31:11,687
Where are you going?

490
00:31:12,021 --> 00:31:14,156
I think I have to find something.

491
00:31:23,499 --> 00:31:25,868
I think he knows something. Slightly.

492
00:31:27,336 --> 00:31:28,871
Did he find a hint?

493
00:31:30,172 --> 00:31:31,740
Is he my first love?

494
00:31:31,874 --> 00:31:33,843
Is Jae Suk oppa my first love?

495
00:31:37,646 --> 00:31:39,748
My first love within Running Man...

496
00:31:40,382 --> 00:31:42,218
Oh, it might not be me, right.

497
00:31:43,452 --> 00:31:45,354
I can't recall!

498
00:31:45,855 --> 00:31:48,624
Is there some amazing hint hidden within here?

499
00:31:57,733 --> 00:32:00,135
Could my first love be Gary hyung?

500
00:32:03,272 --> 00:32:05,040
You think it's me?

501
00:32:05,708 --> 00:32:07,109
You're my first love?

502
00:32:07,309 --> 00:32:09,111
Hyung, are. you my first love?

503
00:32:09,144 --> 00:32:10,379
Truly?

504
00:32:10,646 --> 00:32:12,348
Could it be?

505
00:32:13,515 --> 00:32:16,585
Because I have amnesia, I don’t remember very well.

506
00:32:19,388 --> 00:32:20,723
Are you OK?

507
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:22,892
-HaHa. are you OK? -I think I remember!

508
00:32:22,925 --> 00:32:24,627
Who is it?! Who's your first love?

509
00:32:24,693 --> 00:32:25,828
Here.

510
00:32:25,895 --> 00:32:29,398
-Who is it?! -Oh my head! The person had double eyelids!

511
00:32:29,832 --> 00:32:31,200
Like this?

512
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,535
-Oh! My first love! -Is it not me?

513
00:32:33,969 --> 00:32:35,971
I think it's you. hyung!

514
00:32:42,945 --> 00:32:43,946
Hyung!

515
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:45,347
Am I out?

516
00:32:45,381 --> 00:32:47,883
Hey. you startled me.

517
00:32:47,917 --> 00:32:51,654
We could be first loves later, so when we are, let's deeply...

518
00:32:51,654 --> 00:32:52,554
Sure.

519
00:32:52,554 --> 00:32:53,889
Show that.

520
00:32:54,456 --> 00:32:56,158
Your colour is looking good today.

521
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:21,116
I think my first love just passed by.

522
00:33:21,183 --> 00:33:23,085
I must have seen incorrectly.

523
00:33:24,787 --> 00:33:26,655
See you later, my love.

524
00:33:26,689 --> 00:33:27,756
Where are you going?

525
00:33:27,823 --> 00:33:30,492
-I’m just looking around, hyung. -You look like you have a mission.

526
00:33:30,726 --> 00:33:32,394
-Eh? -You look like you have a mission.

527
00:33:32,528 --> 00:33:34,296
I don't have one.

528
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:47,042
I think I'll play on the slide.

529
00:33:47,743 --> 00:33:50,212
-If you get on that, where do you go? -Down there.

530
00:33:50,245 --> 00:33:52,047
-Get on. -I'll go first!

531
00:33:52,548 --> 00:33:54,049
I'll go first!

532
00:34:00,089 --> 00:34:01,790
My love! Are you all right? My love?

533
00:34:20,909 --> 00:34:24,513
I Just looked at the slide and when I Just looked it was just there just stuck to the roof.

534
00:34:25,948 --> 00:34:27,316
See!

535
00:34:27,449 --> 00:34:28,784
Han Ga In!

536
00:34:32,254 --> 00:34:34,523
The name is Han Ga In!

537
00:34:39,728 --> 00:34:45,234
"He was very han some. He looked like a fairytale prince. I'm going to grow up and marry him."

538
00:34:53,976 --> 00:34:56,512
Boys play like that, I guess.

539
00:35:01,050 --> 00:35:03,352
No! You're out!

540
00:35:03,385 --> 00:35:04,920
Hey! Gary!

541
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:06,922
You're out!

542
00:35:07,122 --> 00:35:10,059
Hey, I think Gary likes me.

543
00:35:10,159 --> 00:35:11,427
Do you have someone you like?

544
00:35:12,127 --> 00:35:13,729
What about you?

545
00:35:13,796 --> 00:35:16,031
I... I... I...

546
00:35:16,498 --> 00:35:21,036
Since we're both embarrassed, let's just point in one shot!

547
00:35:21,170 --> 00:35:23,305
One, two, three!

548
00:35:23,405 --> 00:35:24,640
Him!

549
00:35:36,218 --> 00:35:37,352
Ah, green!

550
00:35:39,521 --> 00:35:40,989
Ah, he's wearing green.

551
00:35:43,525 --> 00:35:45,394
It's Yoo Jae Suk.

552
00:35:48,697 --> 00:35:51,934
The face looks like Yoo Jae Suk, too. His face is longish.

553
00:35:53,035 --> 00:35:54,937
Green is...

554
00:35:56,205 --> 00:35:57,840
definitely Jae Suk hyung.

555
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:06,215
-Really? -Oh. go down this way.

556
00:36:06,281 --> 00:36:08,684
It's usually somewhere here. When you're going down the slide.

557
00:36:09,184 --> 00:36:11,487
Then I'll go down first.

558
00:36:13,122 --> 00:36:15,290
Is here something there? Look carefully.

559
00:36:23,499 --> 00:36:26,235
Hey! Wait! Hey!! Wait!!

560
00:36:28,504 --> 00:36:30,939
Hey! You. really! I'll...!

561
00:36:30,973 --> 00:36:33,408
-I will..! -Is there something there?

562
00:36:33,475 --> 00:36:36,411
I will seriously not let you get off easily!

563
00:36:36,445 --> 00:36:39,314
I will...! This time, I will...!

564
00:36:39,314 --> 00:36:41,183
- not let you get so easily... -That's not-it...

565
00:36:41,216 --> 00:36:44,219
-Someone had to check! -I will seriously...

566
00:36:44,253 --> 00:36:45,988
-Hyung! -You truly...

567
00:36:48,824 --> 00:36:50,292
-Is there something there? -Oh!

568
00:36:50,993 --> 00:36:52,194
What is it??

569
00:36:54,029 --> 00:36:55,130
Hyung!

570
00:36:55,197 --> 00:36:56,832
No, it's OK now Gwang Soo.

571
00:37:04,373 --> 00:37:06,041
-Did you find something? -I'm here!

572
00:37:06,175 --> 00:37:07,776
No... Hyung...

573
00:37:07,809 --> 00:37:09,545
-I'm here!! -No, that’s...!

574
00:37:09,578 --> 00:37:12,080
You want to know what's here? I'm here!

575
00:37:12,181 --> 00:37:13,916
You made me let go? Over there?

576
00:37:14,082 --> 00:37:15,484
That's not it...

577
00:37:16,919 --> 00:37:18,954
I think it would be somewhere like this.

578
00:37:24,826 --> 00:37:26,628
Oh, no, no, no!

579
00:37:27,229 --> 00:37:29,531
-No, it's not time yet! Hyung! -What is?

580
00:37:29,698 --> 00:37:31,600
-It's not time yet! You're not supposed to! Hyung! -Hmm?

581
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:32,701
-What isn't? -Hyung!

582
00:37:33,001 --> 00:37:36,004
Were you then supposed to tear of my name tag when you ripped it off?

583
00:37:36,505 --> 00:37:37,706
No, I wasn't but...

584
00:37:37,739 --> 00:37:40,042
Ahh, hyung! Hyung!

585
00:37:40,175 --> 00:37:42,377
Please! Stop! Stop!

586
00:37:42,778 --> 00:37:44,313
Please!

587
00:37:44,479 --> 00:37:45,714
Get your act together.

588
00:37:47,516 --> 00:37:49,184
-Don't do that anymore. -Yes, sir.

589
00:37:49,284 --> 00:37:51,353
We might be first loves, Gwang Soo.

590
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:52,988
Always remember.

591
00:37:53,922 --> 00:37:55,524
That we may be first loves.

592
00:37:56,658 --> 00:37:58,193
Us...?

593
00:38:01,730 --> 00:38:03,799
-Oppa, what's the hint? -Excuse me?

594
00:38:03,799 --> 00:38:05,133
What's the hint?

595
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,936
-Ah... maiden Veon Woo. -You know, don't you?

596
00:38:08,003 --> 00:38:09,605
-You can't come suddenly like this. -What's the hint?

597
00:38:09,738 --> 00:38:10,706
The hint?

598
00:38:13,408 --> 00:38:15,143
Do you not know what we're supposed to find?

599
00:38:15,377 --> 00:38:16,745
No, now...

600
00:38:17,679 --> 00:38:19,548
There's something... like this...

601
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:27,756
-Is there? -You can't tell anyone.

602
00:38:42,137 --> 00:38:43,171
There...

603
00:38:44,206 --> 00:38:45,874
What we wrote in when we were younger...

604
00:38:45,907 --> 00:38:48,243
the picture diaries, you know?

605
00:39:04,493 --> 00:39:06,094
That’s what we’re looking for.

606
00:39:07,195 --> 00:39:10,332
-I'm just especially telling you. -Did you find one?

607
00:39:10,399 --> 00:39:14,002
So you can't tell anyone. Anyone. This is an individual competition.

608
00:39:14,036 --> 00:39:16,872
-If I find one, I'll call you. -Yes. Please.

609
00:39:16,872 --> 00:39:18,440
-Hyung! -What?

610
00:39:19,474 --> 00:39:20,976
You really can't tell anyone!

611
00:39:35,057 --> 00:39:36,725
She's maiden Yeon Woo...

612
00:39:37,859 --> 00:39:39,594
I wanted to become Yang Myeong-gun.

613
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:43,699
I wanted to become Yang Myeong-gun!

614
00:39:49,905 --> 00:39:51,840
This is a present from me.

615
00:39:58,647 --> 00:40:00,949
If I can't be her first love, at least if I could be Yang Myeong-gun.

616
00:40:14,996 --> 00:40:16,898
-Do not come close! -Oppa.

617
00:40:17,499 --> 00:40:19,668
Do not come close!

618
00:40:20,001 --> 00:40:21,803
And do not stray far...

619
00:40:21,870 --> 00:40:24,940
Are you threatening me because you’re the guest?!

620
00:40:27,109 --> 00:40:30,312
-Are you threatening me?! -This is not a threat.

621
00:40:31,179 --> 00:40:32,848
You... you're not?

622
00:40:34,383 --> 00:40:36,785
I thought it was a threat.

623
00:40:37,252 --> 00:40:38,587
Daebak!

624
00:40:39,321 --> 00:40:42,591
Do not come close! Do not come close!

625
00:40:44,159 --> 00:40:46,328
Why did you not choose me?

626
00:40:47,095 --> 00:40:51,199
If we had been on the same side, I could have worked harder for you.

627
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:54,102
I want to turn back time!

628
00:40:54,236 --> 00:40:57,472
Can we not turn back time.

629
00:40:57,706 --> 00:40:59,641
Where are you going?

630
00:41:19,728 --> 00:41:21,329
I thought there was something under here

631
00:41:21,596 --> 00:41:25,700
so I lifted it and there was a memo, so I went "What is it?!" but it only says, "Be careful of the glass".

632
00:41:26,868 --> 00:41:30,071
Oh? Oh, it's not...

633
00:41:37,646 --> 00:41:40,081
Here... There's even a shovel.

634
00:41:47,255 --> 00:41:49,024
Can I go... can I go in?

635
00:41:56,264 --> 00:41:57,833
Oh my!

636
00:42:15,183 --> 00:42:18,320
I think this child was my first love.

637
00:42:18,553 --> 00:42:21,790
"He pulled my hair so I cried. Why does he only do this to me?"

638
00:42:21,857 --> 00:42:25,627
It is. If this is me, this is the child.

639
00:42:26,027 --> 00:42:28,129
Is it this child?

640
00:42:28,230 --> 00:42:30,131
He has to be here.

641
00:42:37,672 --> 00:42:40,842
When Cinderella was young,

642
00:42:40,876 --> 00:42:43,311
she lost both her parents.

643
00:42:43,578 --> 00:42:45,514
From her stepmother and...

644
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:46,915
Ow!

645
00:42:47,249 --> 00:42:48,750
Who is it?!

646
00:42:49,084 --> 00:42:50,619
Eh, whatever.

647
00:42:57,859 --> 00:43:00,462
If I catch you, you’re dead!

648
00:43:02,297 --> 00:43:06,134
♫ Submeigeti in longing ♫

649
00:43:06,334 --> 00:43:09,871
♫ that gefs thicker as time passes ♫

650
00:43:09,938 --> 00:43:16,144
♫ Can we not turn back time? ♫

651
00:43:16,177 --> 00:43:24,219
♫ If you hugged me as you did bach then ♫

652
00:43:24,352 --> 00:43:32,827
♫ I would feel better now ♫

653
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:38,867
Hyung, where did you find this?

654
00:43:38,967 --> 00:43:41,736
-Over there. -Oh. down there? You didn't find it here?

655
00:43:42,037 --> 00:43:44,005
I don't really understand it actually.

656
00:43:45,740 --> 00:43:47,475
Oh, it looks like this.

657
00:43:47,542 --> 00:43:48,977
Ah.

658
00:43:49,444 --> 00:43:55,050
"During the talent show, everyone danced together, dances really well. He was like a celebrity." So...

659
00:43:55,817 --> 00:43:58,520
Ah. but there has to be a name.

660
00:43:58,587 --> 00:44:00,121
-Oh! Han Ga In! -Han Ga In!

661
00:44:00,255 --> 00:44:03,058
-There was a name in the back! -That's what I was looking for!

662
00:44:03,058 --> 00:44:08,229
So In the front, I thought there should be a name, but there's no name. That's right! The name!

663
00:44:09,130 --> 00:44:11,499
-If this is truly Han Ga In... -Yeah.

664
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:15,203
Then it could be him. He's holding a mic.

665
00:44:15,470 --> 00:44:19,507
He's not wearing glasses. Hyung,look. We only have a little information, so let’s solve it like this.

666
00:44:19,608 --> 00:44:22,110
-It could be you. -Me or...

667
00:44:22,344 --> 00:44:25,113
Me, Gwang Soo and Gary. It's one of us.

668
00:44:25,447 --> 00:44:28,950
-It's one of you or... -Let's think broadly. It could also be Song Ji Hyo, right?

669
00:44:30,452 --> 00:44:32,554
Han Ga In's previous love.

670
00:44:33,321 --> 00:44:35,824
-Hyung, you can keep this well hidden, right? -Of course.

671
00:44:36,057 --> 00:44:38,960
-It makes me uneasy. -Do you want to take it then?

672
00:44:39,127 --> 00:44:41,229
Hyung, but if you're eliminated, what...

673
00:44:41,429 --> 00:44:42,998
Could I not hold onto it?

674
00:44:43,131 --> 00:44:46,334
-If you get caught later... -Fine. You keep it. If you find another one. show me.

675
00:44:46,434 --> 00:44:47,936
Of course!

676
00:44:48,370 --> 00:44:51,740
I promise. We need to go around quickly during this time.

677
00:44:51,773 --> 00:44:53,541
-Hold it. -All right.

678
00:44:55,744 --> 00:44:59,981
It seems it's Han Ga In and someone else who are the first loves.

679
00:45:02,951 --> 00:45:05,954
Oh, Ga In-ssi. Why are you...

680
00:45:06,021 --> 00:45:09,224
-Excuse me? -Have you found something?

681
00:45:09,257 --> 00:45:11,559
No. I haven't, but...

682
00:45:11,626 --> 00:45:15,363
-You found something, didn't you? -You haven't found anything, Ga In-ssi?

683
00:45:15,430 --> 00:45:18,099
-I did slightly find something... -Oh, you did?

684
00:45:18,133 --> 00:45:20,402
-Really? -Yes.

685
00:45:20,568 --> 00:45:23,571
But, I can't make sense of it.

686
00:45:23,638 --> 00:45:25,674
You can't make sense of it? Why not?

687
00:45:25,807 --> 00:45:28,243
-It's insufficient. -Really?

688
00:45:29,310 --> 00:45:32,614
Then, shall we both... look at them...?

689
00:45:32,714 --> 00:45:35,350
-Shall we? -And analyse them?

690
00:45:35,583 --> 00:45:38,586
-But this is... -Yes?

691
00:45:44,759 --> 00:45:46,828
Look at Jong Kook hyung's poison at work.

692
00:45:52,901 --> 00:45:54,002
Okay.

693
00:45:56,037 --> 00:45:58,573
-Oppa, what’s the name on yours? -Whose is it?

694
00:45:58,606 --> 00:46:00,542
-Mine is mine. -Han Ga In?

695
00:46:00,608 --> 00:46:02,811
-Oppa. yours in mine, too. right? -This one is also Han Ga In.

696
00:46:03,211 --> 00:46:08,283
-He's a troublemaker. He pulled my hair. That's not it. See, we have to analyse the photo.

697
00:46:08,583 --> 00:46:12,287
There are kids with glasses and kids without, within the boys.

698
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:15,690
-He's not wearing glasses here, too. -He's not, see.

699
00:46:15,757 --> 00:46:18,126
-Then firstly, it's not the ones with glasses. -Then taking out the ones with glasses...

700
00:46:18,126 --> 00:46:20,462
Gwang Soo and Gary.

701
00:46:20,628 --> 00:46:23,965
And me. But he's holding a mic here.

702
00:46:24,232 --> 00:46:26,668
So we thought, perhaps it could be a singer?

703
00:46:26,768 --> 00:46:29,838
Then it's either Gary or me.

704
00:46:39,748 --> 00:46:41,149
-But... -Yes?

705
00:46:42,383 --> 00:46:44,152
He's definitely a singer.

706
00:46:44,185 --> 00:46:46,154
"My dream is becoming a singer."

707
00:46:46,554 --> 00:46:51,659
- "...danced together... dances really well. He was like a celebrity." -Wait...

708
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:54,129
Could it be me?

709
00:46:56,531 --> 00:47:01,269
It sounds like "My Childhood Dream". "My Childhood Dream". Turbo's "My Childhood Dream".

710
00:47:04,572 --> 00:47:07,142
It seems like Jong Kook oppa...

711
00:47:14,816 --> 00:47:19,020
I'll keep it and I'll hide it well.

712
00:47:20,789 --> 00:47:22,857
If perhaps...

713
00:47:25,226 --> 00:47:29,831
That diary... is a haeuseok that I'm giving to you. Ga In-ssi.

714
00:47:33,268 --> 00:47:36,871
- I've completely become a an o your drama. - Yang Myeong-gun...

715
00:47:37,038 --> 00:47:38,573
Lord Yang Myeong...

716
00:47:38,706 --> 00:47:41,109
-Please, go first. -Yes.. I will.

717
00:47:41,309 --> 00:47:44,112
But... what is really sad about Yang Myeorig-gun'is...

718
00:47:44,112 --> 00:47:45,513
he dies in the last episode.

719
00:47:45,580 --> 00:47:48,850
-He dies in the last episode. -What did you say?

720
00:47:48,917 --> 00:47:50,285
He dies?

721
00:47:50,418 --> 00:47:53,121
Yang Myeong-gun dies in the end!

722
00:47:54,322 --> 00:47:56,457
He dies?

723
00:47:56,858 --> 00:47:59,327
Wow, this is ominous.

724
00:47:59,327 --> 00:48:02,263
This is ominous...

725
00:48:04,432 --> 00:48:06,801
It’s one of these three...

726
00:48:07,068 --> 00:48:11,673
He dances well, and he pulled my hair...

727
00:48:15,643 --> 00:48:17,779
It seems like Jong Kook oppa...

728
00:48:18,046 --> 00:48:20,582
There's no way to confirm this...

729
00:48:57,385 --> 00:48:58,353
Oh?!

730
00:49:02,357 --> 00:49:05,026
This way. I can't open this anywhere.

731
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:08,529
No, because there's no information for me!

732
00:49:08,529 --> 00:49:10,832
"Today..." "Today is picture day."

733
00:49:10,865 --> 00:49:16,337
"He wore glasses today to look handsome. He looks better with glasses."

734
00:49:18,873 --> 00:49:22,043
One, two, three...

735
00:49:28,583 --> 00:49:32,520
-You have a hint, don't you? -Show us.

736
00:49:32,787 --> 00:49:34,722
I do have a hint, but...

737
00:49:34,722 --> 00:49:36,257
-Dong Hoon! -Yes...?

738
00:49:36,357 --> 00:49:38,960
-Can't you just show us? -No, but what were you two doing together?

739
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:40,161
Can't you just show us?

740
00:49:40,161 --> 00:49:42,764
-I will show you. but what were you doing? -Before, we got together...

741
00:49:42,830 --> 00:49:45,900
- to see what we had to do with the photo. -I really don't know what to do so I asked him.

742
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:48,169
To ask what I had to do.

743
00:49:48,503 --> 00:49:51,639
-So there's something... -Do not come close.

744
00:49:57,612 --> 00:50:04,485
-I am trying to do something... -Do you have something?

745
00:50:05,119 --> 00:50:09,223
"He was very handsome..He looked like a fairytale prince."

746
00:50:09,290 --> 00:50:11,759
"I'm going to grow up and marry him."

747
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:15,964
"He was very handsome"? Handsome?

748
00:50:15,997 --> 00:50:20,435
So we can definitely say that it's not Gary hyung. Gwang Soo or Suk Jin hyung.

749
00:50:21,069 --> 00:50:23,771
But do you know what the most important hint is?

750
00:50:29,510 --> 00:50:31,412
The colour green!

751
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:34,148
Jae Suk hyung.

752
00:50:34,415 --> 00:50:35,984
Jae Suk oppa likes green.

753
00:50:36,351 --> 00:50:38,086
Green-dori.

754
00:50:55,169 --> 00:50:57,338
-Come out this way. -Okay, okay. It's quiet.

755
00:51:01,242 --> 00:51:04,445
-Green. Green clothes. -Exactly.

756
00:51:04,645 --> 00:51:07,548
Because Yoo Hyuk is dance.

757
00:51:07,615 --> 00:51:09,884
Right! Dance!

758
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:15,690
"He wore glasses today to look handsome."

759
00:51:16,557 --> 00:51:18,860
At the back, "Han Ga In".

760
00:51:18,860 --> 00:51:20,528
-You didn't know, did you? -No.

761
00:51:20,561 --> 00:51:22,897
-It's Han Ga In's picture diary -Really?

762
00:51:22,930 --> 00:51:26,601
-So we’re trying to find the person Han Ga In liked. -I'll show you mine.

763
00:51:28,903 --> 00:51:34,942
" danced the best. He was like a celebrity."

764
00:51:35,343 --> 00:51:38,279
-Dance? Yoo Hyuk? -Yoo Hyuk! Dance!

765
00:51:39,347 --> 00:51:41,649
So it’s Jae Suk.

766
00:51:51,359 --> 00:51:53,428
-He's coming. -Jae Suk!

767
00:51:53,661 --> 00:51:55,630
-We have something to say to you. -What is it?

768
00:51:55,830 --> 00:51:57,698
-No. -Come here.

769
00:51:57,799 --> 00:51:58,699
I'm saying the truth.

770
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:00,635
-We have something to tell you. -We found your first love.

771
00:52:00,868 --> 00:52:02,837
Hey.

772
00:52:03,037 --> 00:52:05,606
-Your first love... -Why?

773
00:52:05,873 --> 00:52:09,143
-The clues we found show that you're the first love. -Me and you, hyung?

774
00:52:09,177 --> 00:52:11,212
-No. You're the first love. -Me and who?

775
00:52:11,312 --> 00:52:12,647
Whose first love?

776
00:52:12,747 --> 00:52:15,316
-Hyung. you’re just the first love. -You're today's first love protagonist.

777
00:52:15,516 --> 00:52:17,852
Why? What's the clue?

778
00:52:18,886 --> 00:52:20,555
-Ga In-ssi. -There's something.

779
00:52:20,588 --> 00:52:22,390
Have you found something?

780
00:52:22,957 --> 00:52:24,358
What did you find?

781
00:52:24,358 --> 00:52:27,728
-You're the first love! -Why?! Why am I the first love?

782
00:52:28,062 --> 00:52:30,098
-Jae Suk hyung! -Jae Suk hyung!

783
00:52:30,198 --> 00:52:33,301
-I think your memory should be returning. -Of what?

784
00:52:34,569 --> 00:52:37,205
-What did you say? -Are your memories of your first love not returning?

785
00:52:37,338 --> 00:52:38,706
I have no clue.

786
00:52:38,773 --> 00:52:42,477
-Hyung, I'll tell you but, it's not you. -It's not me?

787
00:52:42,543 --> 00:52:43,978
Yeah, I'm...

788
00:52:44,545 --> 00:52:48,216
Gary, you're not it. If it were, they would have called you out especially.

789
00:52:49,817 --> 00:52:53,187
Usually they make you wear green, but they didn't this time.

790
00:52:53,354 --> 00:52:54,922
Exactly.

791
00:52:55,456 --> 00:52:57,725
Hey Then is it me?

792
00:52:58,126 --> 00:52:59,961
Was it me?

793
00:53:00,228 --> 00:53:02,430
-They didn't call you out separately? -No.

794
00:53:02,463 --> 00:53:04,465
Hyung, can't you just tell us what you know?

795
00:53:04,532 --> 00:53:06,767
Yeah! You should tell us!

796
00:53:07,034 --> 00:53:09,804
-I know for sure. -How are you so sure?

797
00:53:09,937 --> 00:53:11,239
Because I'm me!

798
00:53:11,472 --> 00:53:13,474
H-hey! That was cool!

799
00:53:13,541 --> 00:53:16,110
Hey. Jong Kook is really cool. He's the coolest!

800
00:53:16,177 --> 00:53:17,979
"Because I'm me!" how cool is that?

801
00:53:18,045 --> 00:53:20,248
But where is Gwang Soo?

802
00:53:20,448 --> 00:53:22,183
Where is Gwang Soo-ssi?

803
00:53:55,750 --> 00:53:58,753
"Today we held a party for the August birthdays."

804
00:53:58,853 --> 00:54:01,689
"I gave ♥♥a kiss as a present."

805
00:54:04,458 --> 00:54:08,029
Happy birthday to you!

806
00:54:09,030 --> 00:54:12,667
Happy birthday to you!

807
00:54:13,034 --> 00:54:16,938
Happy birthday, dear August birthday friends!

808
00:54:17,038 --> 00:54:20,308
Happy birthday to you!

809
00:54:22,276 --> 00:54:25,780
August birthdays? Jae Suk hyung has an August birthday.

810
00:54:26,781 --> 00:54:28,749
Ji Hyo nuna is also in August.

811
00:54:30,384 --> 00:54:32,253
This is Ga In nuna's?

812
00:54:37,425 --> 00:54:38,859
Nuna!

813
00:54:39,660 --> 00:54:40,928
Nuna!

814
00:54:41,128 --> 00:54:42,830
Do you have something?

815
00:54:42,897 --> 00:54:44,031
Nuna!

816
00:54:44,532 --> 00:54:46,767
-Did you find something? -I...

817
00:54:47,134 --> 00:54:48,936
Do you know? Who?

818
00:54:52,039 --> 00:54:53,674
It said they had a birthday party.

819
00:54:54,642 --> 00:54:55,943
What day?

820
00:54:57,144 --> 00:54:59,280
Ah, but...

821
00:55:00,448 --> 00:55:04,085
You have it, right? You didn't hide it?

822
00:55:04,151 --> 00:55:06,187
-I hid it. -Where is it?

823
00:55:08,923 --> 00:55:12,126
Gan I tell you? It's my first time finding something like this.

824
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:15,229
I'm not sure what I should do.

825
00:55:15,329 --> 00:55:17,198
This is my first time finding something like this.

826
00:55:17,531 --> 00:55:22,470
-I'm not sure what to do. -Just show it to me once. Just once.

827
00:55:22,803 --> 00:55:26,641
What did it say? Just the drawing, so I can see what it is about.

828
00:55:26,974 --> 00:55:31,078
Ah, show me. Ah, so frustrating. So frustrating.

829
00:55:31,145 --> 00:55:33,414
-Are you angry...? -No

830
00:55:49,630 --> 00:55:51,299
where Is it?

831
00:55:52,566 --> 00:55:55,303
I hid it... in the VJ's backpack.

832
00:55:57,071 --> 00:55:59,006
I hid it in hyung's backpack.

833
00:56:00,708 --> 00:56:03,344
Let's hide here.

834
00:56:10,418 --> 00:56:12,186
What is this?

835
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:14,121
This is so strange.

836
00:56:14,121 --> 00:56:16,957
This... is our secret place.

837
00:56:24,065 --> 00:56:27,735
-"We held a party..." "I gave ♥♥ a ki..." -But they're both wearing glasses.

838
00:56:27,968 --> 00:56:30,471
-Yeah. They're wearing glasses.

839
00:56:31,372 --> 00:56:35,176
It's HaHa hyung or Jae Suk hyung or Suk Jin hyung.

840
00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:41,382
I'll go hide Th is.

841
00:56:41,582 --> 00:56:43,384
Back into that bag.

842
00:56:50,057 --> 00:56:53,060
-I'm telling you without asking for anything in return. -Thank you.

843
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:55,029
When’s his birthday?

844
00:56:55,730 --> 00:56:57,898
It’s August 20th.

845
00:57:04,138 --> 00:57:07,875
-August 20th? Then he's wearing glasses... -Jong Kook hyung, Jong Kook hyung.

846
00:57:09,143 --> 00:57:11,979
I'll try to... first...

847
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:14,382
What are you doing, Gwang Soo?

848
00:57:14,415 --> 00:57:15,649
Yes?

849
00:57:15,950 --> 00:57:17,952
-Wait! -Have you found something?

850
00:57:17,985 --> 00:57:20,488
-Have you found something? -No I haven't.

851
00:57:20,688 --> 00:57:23,057
Ga in-ssi, do you really not know?

852
00:57:23,224 --> 00:57:25,426
I don't. How do you know?

853
00:57:25,459 --> 00:57:27,261
Do you really not know?

854
00:57:27,661 --> 00:57:30,030
This is so pitiful!

855
00:57:30,264 --> 00:57:31,799
Ah, Yeon Woo!

856
00:57:31,832 --> 00:57:34,435
Your memory has to return! Your memories!

857
00:57:34,468 --> 00:57:36,937
-Gwang! -Your memory has to return, your memories!

858
00:57:37,071 --> 00:57:38,706
-You have to do this and 'Ga'. -Ga.

859
00:57:38,739 --> 00:57:40,741
-Gwang! -Ga!

860
00:57:40,841 --> 00:57:42,276
Cross!

861
00:57:43,344 --> 00:57:46,347
Don't follow him. Ga In-ssi!

862
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:48,682
-Just please understand my feelings. -No, he's just..!

863
00:57:49,283 --> 00:57:52,386
-We were the same team! -Ga In-ssi, he's really no good.

864
00:57:52,420 --> 00:57:56,323
Then I'll ask you something oppa. If you have something.

865
00:57:56,557 --> 00:57:58,359
-If you know something. -Truly...

866
00:57:58,359 --> 00:58:01,962
-What are you talking about?! -But...

867
00:58:02,029 --> 00:58:06,667
-We haven't even shared anything! -He's really...!

868
00:58:06,734 --> 00:58:09,003
-We haven't shared anything! -He's really...!

869
00:58:09,236 --> 00:58:11,505
-But I gave you my all! -Ga In-ssi!

870
00:58:11,572 --> 00:58:13,808
He's really... You, you know...

871
00:58:13,874 --> 00:58:17,912
You always... Let's say you're not the first love.

872
00:58:18,245 --> 00:58:21,816
Then, if you had the chance, who would you eliminate first?

873
00:58:22,817 --> 00:58:25,219
You, hyung!

874
00:58:25,619 --> 00:58:27,655
-But I wouldn't. -Why not?

875
00:58:28,823 --> 00:58:30,858
Because I should stay until the end with hyung.

876
00:58:30,958 --> 00:58:35,029
Even if I trust everyone. I can't trust you!

877
00:58:35,229 --> 00:58:37,064
Kook!

878
00:58:38,666 --> 00:58:40,701
Soo! Cross!

879
00:58:40,801 --> 00:58:43,070
Cross!

880
00:58:51,412 --> 00:58:55,349
Lee Gwang Soo, out! Lee Gwang Soo. out!

881
00:58:59,019 --> 00:59:00,621
So he's eliminated?

882
00:59:00,621 --> 00:59:02,356
-Yes. -Why?

883
00:59:02,423 --> 00:59:03,958
Why?

884
00:59:04,058 --> 00:59:07,127
-Because I ripped it off. -Oh really? You know something, don't you?

885
00:59:07,328 --> 00:59:09,063
-Do you really not know? -I don't.

886
00:59:09,163 --> 00:59:14,168
Give me a hint! It's my first appearance, and how could you not even give me one hint? It’s so merciless here!

887
00:59:15,736 --> 00:59:17,671
Gwang Soo!

888
00:59:18,272 --> 00:59:20,574
Where is Gwang Soo?

889
00:59:21,709 --> 00:59:22,776
Hey!

890
00:59:27,081 --> 00:59:28,983
She's so pitiful...

891
00:59:32,887 --> 00:59:36,323
Truly... Truly... Wol's memory must return.

892
00:59:36,757 --> 00:59:40,427
Wol needs to get better.

893
00:59:43,764 --> 00:59:46,267
Hey, Kim Jong Kook! Did you eliminate him?

894
00:59:46,300 --> 00:59:48,068
Did you eliminate him?

895
00:59:49,003 --> 00:59:52,473
If I'm not her first love. then...

896
00:59:53,407 --> 00:59:55,876
-Isn't it that? -What?

897
00:59:56,310 --> 00:59:58,712
What is he saying today?!

898
01:00:04,151 --> 01:00:05,753
Dong Hoon!

899
01:00:06,053 --> 01:00:07,354
Dong Hoon!

900
01:00:07,655 --> 01:00:09,223
Watch out, watch out.

901
01:00:11,125 --> 01:00:14,061
-You two are... not that right? -Are what?

902
01:00:14,128 --> 01:00:18,032
-What are you talking about, hyung! -What would we do to you?

903
01:00:19,300 --> 01:00:20,467
We were reasoning.

904
01:00:20,868 --> 01:00:22,236
Reasoning what?

905
01:00:23,604 --> 01:00:26,740
-It's right, right? I don't think there's anyone else but him. -It's 100%!

906
01:00:26,807 --> 01:00:30,377
They went in that way. I pushed the two of them together on purpose that way.

907
01:00:30,411 --> 01:00:33,047
But Wol's memory is completely not returning.

908
01:00:33,080 --> 01:00:35,783
Then Han Ga In tore off Gwang Soo's name tag?

909
01:00:35,816 --> 01:00:37,851
-No, I ripped it off! -Why did you?

910
01:00:37,885 --> 01:00:40,287
Because Gwang Soo is nothing!

911
01:00:40,421 --> 01:00:44,158
What's with that?

912
01:00:46,360 --> 01:00:48,729
Then this hyung is also nothing!

913
01:00:50,798 --> 01:00:54,101
Hyung! I didn't rip it off! I didn't!

914
01:00:57,605 --> 01:01:01,241
Ji Suk Jin, out! Ji Suft Jin, out!

915
01:01:13,253 --> 01:01:14,922
Hang on...

916
01:01:15,089 --> 01:01:17,124
Is it truly me and Ga In?

917
01:01:17,358 --> 01:01:19,860
In the past, Ga In and I were in a skit.

918
01:01:22,029 --> 01:01:24,331
I think they're referring to that.

919
01:01:24,932 --> 01:01:27,301
-Oppa. -Hyung, hyung.

920
01:01:27,968 --> 01:01:29,203
Hyung.

921
01:01:29,937 --> 01:01:32,506
-Hyung, let's go to the prep room or now. -Why?

922
01:01:33,040 --> 01:01:35,075
-Do you know who is it? -I have no clue.

923
01:01:35,142 --> 01:01:37,611
-We know for sure. -Who is it?

924
01:01:37,778 --> 01:01:40,748
-It's Jong Kook oppa, -Why?

925
01:01:40,914 --> 01:01:43,984
-Let's go that way first. -The prep room.

926
01:01:44,785 --> 01:01:46,520
I thought it was you, hyung.

927
01:01:46,654 --> 01:01:50,124
I also... I... I thought maybe it was me... It's not me?

928
01:01:50,157 --> 01:01:52,660
-It's not you, oppa. -Why not?

929
01:01:52,860 --> 01:01:54,128
It's not me?

930
01:01:54,128 --> 01:01:56,697
-Did you eliminate Suk Jin oppa? -Because I haven't found anything...

931
01:01:56,897 --> 01:01:59,166
Oppa, oppa, see.

932
01:01:59,633 --> 01:02:02,569
Jong Kook oppa guided you somewhere.

933
01:02:02,603 --> 01:02:06,373
-Yeah, he... -So everyone thought it was you.

934
01:02:06,373 --> 01:02:07,374
-Oh! -See this!

935
01:02:07,408 --> 01:02:12,980
In the picture diary... "Today Is picture day. He wore his glasses today to look handsome."

936
01:02:13,080 --> 01:02:16,250
"He looks better with glasses." So glasses means that you...

937
01:02:16,316 --> 01:02:18,519
So it's not me. It's someone who doesn't wear glasses.

938
01:02:18,619 --> 01:02:26,660
So. the people who are wearing glasses since they were younger Is Ji Suk Jin oppa and HaHa oppa. It's one of you three.

939
01:02:26,727 --> 01:02:29,530
-So Gwang Soo is already eliminated and I'm... -Yeah.

940
01:02:29,663 --> 01:02:35,669
But. the scarier thing is. when Gwang Soo was eliminated, I witnessed the scene.

941
01:02:35,703 --> 01:02:39,606
-But? -Jong Kook oppa was with Han Ga In-ssi.

942
01:02:39,673 --> 01:02:41,375
Really?

943
01:02:41,408 --> 01:02:43,677
-So.. -It's not me.

944
01:02:43,811 --> 01:02:47,881
Oppa, oppa. you thought you were the protagonist, didn't you...

945
01:02:48,182 --> 01:02:52,086
-But Oppa, see, what's more important is. -Wait, Kwon Ryul...

946
01:02:53,020 --> 01:02:54,722
Ah hyung! You had something!

947
01:02:54,788 --> 01:02:56,490
Hyung. how could you be like this?

948
01:02:56,590 --> 01:02:58,425
Well, I tricked people, too.

949
01:02:59,860 --> 01:03:02,730
-What did you find? -What I showed you earlier. That one.

950
01:03:02,830 --> 01:03:05,399
-What about you? -I haven't found anything.

951
01:03:06,233 --> 01:03:08,635
You... didn't find anything, but how do you know everything...?

952
01:03:08,635 --> 01:03:11,271
But I witnessed the scene with my own two eyes, oppa.

953
01:03:12,506 --> 01:03:17,578
If the first loves meet, after they gather 5 name tags, they can open the time capsule, oppa.

954
01:03:17,644 --> 01:03:24,451
We need to ally and rip off the name tag of either Jong Kook oppa or Han Ga In-ssi.

955
01:03:24,585 --> 01:03:27,221
-Hyung, let's try to win against the guest! -Let's do that!

956
01:03:32,826 --> 01:03:35,429
Hey. this looks like where a picture diary...

957
01:03:40,601 --> 01:03:42,803
It opens...

958
01:03:59,153 --> 01:04:01,722
This is crazy, this is crazy, this is crazy, this is crazy.

959
01:04:01,922 --> 01:04:03,757
My gosh.

960
01:04:07,361 --> 01:04:09,630
Hey. wow. my gosh!

961
01:04:12,599 --> 01:04:16,136
"Today we went to a friend's house for snacks."

962
01:04:16,970 --> 01:04:19,540
"It tasted really bad. Ugh,."

963
01:04:34,788 --> 01:04:36,390
It tasted bad...?

964
01:04:36,590 --> 01:04:38,859
It's tastier than my mom’s cooking.

965
01:04:39,059 --> 01:04:41,361
Could you teach my mom...?

966
01:04:45,766 --> 01:04:48,468
Wah, it looks delicious!

967
01:04:48,836 --> 01:04:50,871
Kids, eat well.

968
01:04:50,871 --> 01:04:54,007
Yes, thank you!

969
01:04:57,911 --> 01:04:59,847
Oh., ugh!

970
01:05:00,447 --> 01:05:03,984
Oh my god. Stress.

971
01:05:06,420 --> 01:05:09,122
Why don't you like it? It's tasty.

972
01:05:36,683 --> 01:05:39,419
Glasses don't matter... Because he takes the on and off...

973
01:05:39,720 --> 01:05:42,723
An August birthday... and he dances well...

974
01:05:42,956 --> 01:05:45,058
First, he needs to be a singer...

975
01:05:45,559 --> 01:05:49,930
If he's a singer, it's Jong Kook oppa, Gary oppa. and..

976
01:05:50,697 --> 01:05:52,566
HaHa. these three.

977
01:05:53,166 --> 01:05:57,537
But they had a birthday party in August.

978
01:06:02,576 --> 01:06:04,745
She looks like my mom.

979
01:06:13,487 --> 01:06:16,790
These days l've been focusing on fusion dishes-

980
01:06:26,900 --> 01:06:28,969
The people with birthdays in August are...

981
01:06:48,088 --> 01:06:52,659
Ga In.I'm sorry. Actually, it was because I liked you.

982
01:06:55,762 --> 01:06:59,066
-Hey, who do you think is the coolest? -Me?

983
01:06:59,232 --> 01:07:01,535
Um. I... I... Him!

984
01:07:15,716 --> 01:07:17,751
-Happy birthday. -Thanks!

985
01:07:25,759 --> 01:07:27,427
Ga In...

986
01:07:30,130 --> 01:07:31,631
It's HaHa oppa.

987
01:07:49,249 --> 01:07:50,884
I remember,

988
01:07:55,655 --> 01:07:57,357
I finally remember!

989
01:07:57,924 --> 01:08:01,962
It's me... I'm this week's protagonist...

990
01:08:03,997 --> 01:08:05,866
Protagonist...!

991
01:08:12,139 --> 01:08:15,575
Do not come close! But also do not stray far.

992
01:08:32,259 --> 01:08:33,927
Ah, you startled me!

993
01:08:57,551 --> 01:08:59,553
I'm an August birthday...

994
01:08:59,719 --> 01:09:03,123
'During the talent show, everyone danced together." I dance really well!

995
01:09:05,425 --> 01:09:08,829
"He was very handsome." You know how handsome I am!

996
01:09:10,063 --> 01:09:11,698
My first love!

997
01:09:12,933 --> 01:09:16,303
You know my mom. This looks exactly like my mom!

998
01:09:17,571 --> 01:09:20,474
You have to stay on this side to be filmed properly.

999
01:09:23,844 --> 01:09:26,813
You must find these hints quickly.

1000
01:09:26,947 --> 01:09:29,649
- Chronologically? - and stack them chronologically.

1001
01:09:29,749 --> 01:09:34,087
You will then know who your first love is.

1002
01:09:42,062 --> 01:09:43,730
Ah, if you put them together...

1003
01:09:44,731 --> 01:09:46,333
Windbreaker!

1004
01:09:47,134 --> 01:09:49,903
Windbreaker! Windbreaker, windbreaker.

1005
01:09:51,605 --> 01:09:55,008
But what if it's not me?

1006
01:09:56,977 --> 01:09:59,913
Ah, it makes me cry.

1007
01:10:00,714 --> 01:10:03,850
-Why? Why? -This is really sad.

1008
01:10:04,818 --> 01:10:07,554
-This is really sad. -Why, what's there?

1009
01:10:07,654 --> 01:10:10,357
I think I may be too absorbed in this drama.

1010
01:10:21,234 --> 01:10:22,769
I like you.

1011
01:10:23,570 --> 01:10:25,906
Will you be my first love?

1012
01:10:26,173 --> 01:10:28,909
Since you can't be my last love.

1013
01:10:51,531 --> 01:10:53,433
Has your memory returned?

1014
01:10:55,802 --> 01:10:57,604
Are you alone?

1015
01:10:58,471 --> 01:11:00,807
-Are you alone? -No, HaHa oppa Is ins de.

1016
01:11:00,907 --> 01:11:03,510
-HaHa's inside? -I think he came to check something.

1017
01:11:03,743 --> 01:11:06,213
-What? -Oppa, have you found any picture diaries?

1018
01:11:07,080 --> 01:11:10,016
Do you still not know anything?

1019
01:11:10,617 --> 01:11:12,419
Nothing?!

1020
01:11:13,019 --> 01:11:17,257
-But... -How is this so similar to 'Moon that Embraces the Sun'?

1021
01:11:17,757 --> 01:11:19,259
Oppa! Is it you, oppa?

1022
01:11:19,459 --> 01:11:23,129
No, I told you. I'm...

1023
01:11:23,763 --> 01:11:25,932
I'm Yang Myeong-gun...

1024
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:28,802
You two., what...

1025
01:11:29,636 --> 01:11:31,538
What are you two doing?

1026
01:11:31,638 --> 01:11:35,041
-It's really we Rd. -What did you hear from Hwon?

1027
01:11:35,075 --> 01:11:38,345
-Oppa, the Hwon I know is different. -What?

1028
01:11:38,445 --> 01:11:41,915
-Younthoughts are totally open, Hwon-ie! -The Hwon I know is different.

1029
01:11:41,982 --> 01:11:43,550
Hey Gary, come here!

1030
01:11:43,550 --> 01:11:45,318
Yang Myeong-gun!

1031
01:11:45,518 --> 01:11:50,090
-I'm Yang Myeong-gun! Today my role is Yang Myeong-gun! -He’s Yang Myeong-gun!

1032
01:11:50,290 --> 01:11:51,758
Yang Maeng-

1033
01:11:53,760 --> 01:11:55,929
-What are you two doing? -Hyung!

1034
01:11:56,029 --> 01:12:01,801
-I'm Just... I felt sorry for Ga In-ssi who doesn't understand this game. -Then who has the name tag?

1035
01:12:01,935 --> 01:12:04,004
-Gwang Soo's and Suk Jin oppa's. -Yeah!

1036
01:12:04,104 --> 01:12:06,573
-Why do you have that? -And Suk Jin oppa's?

1037
01:12:08,108 --> 01:12:11,478
-Ji Hyo, are you doubting me? -Yes.

1038
01:12:11,511 --> 01:12:13,179
You make me crazy.

1039
01:12:13,213 --> 01:12:14,748
Yang Myeong-gun.

1040
01:12:15,615 --> 01:12:17,284
-What?! -Yeon Woo!

1041
01:12:17,350 --> 01:12:20,520
-Yeon Woo! -There's no need to pretend!

1042
01:12:20,620 --> 01:12:22,122
I already figured it out!

1043
01:12:22,389 --> 01:12:24,257
Why is he Yang Myeong-gun?!

1044
01:12:24,424 --> 01:12:27,160
Do you have both sides?

1045
01:12:28,528 --> 01:12:31,331
-For now, let's separate, -Let's separate.

1046
01:12:31,464 --> 01:12:35,835
Ga In-ssi, if I told you his much, retrieve your memory and...

1047
01:12:36,236 --> 01:12:38,972
-Ga In, I think you're the most important! -Please find your love!

1048
01:12:39,472 --> 01:12:40,774
Quickly...

1049
01:12:44,711 --> 01:12:47,614
-What was written there? -What was written on yours?

1050
01:12:47,714 --> 01:12:49,282
On yours, oppa.

1051
01:12:49,482 --> 01:12:51,918
-What about your drawing? -I hid it over there.

1052
01:12:51,918 --> 01:12:53,720
-Where? -In there.

1053
01:12:53,820 --> 01:12:55,722
Where?

1054
01:12:55,889 --> 01:12:57,090
Where did you hide it?

1055
01:12:59,459 --> 01:13:02,362
-I've hidden a few. -You saw a few?!

1056
01:13:02,662 --> 01:13:05,398
Really? How many?

1057
01:13:16,810 --> 01:13:18,745
Ga In! Ga In!

1058
01:13:18,812 --> 01:13:20,980
Hey, wait! Wait!

1059
01:13:27,487 --> 01:13:31,624
Yoo Jae Suk, out! Yoo Jae Suk, out!

1060
01:13:34,427 --> 01:13:37,130
-I think it's me. -It's not you!

1061
01:13:37,397 --> 01:13:40,033
-Rest, it's not you. -Yoo Jae Suk. out!

1062
01:13:44,304 --> 01:13:46,473
Oh my God.

1063
01:13:47,006 --> 01:13:48,742
What did it say?

1064
01:13:48,875 --> 01:13:50,810
Yoo Jae Suk is eliminated?

1065
01:13:50,944 --> 01:13:53,146
Who ripped it off? Ga In-ssi?

1066
01:13:55,248 --> 01:13:57,884
-Oppa, then doesn't that mean that Han Ga In-ssi is hiding something? -Hyung!

1067
01:14:00,320 --> 01:14:01,554
Hyung!

1068
01:14:04,057 --> 01:14:06,059
Did Ga In-ssi understand incorrectly...?

1069
01:14:09,028 --> 01:14:10,730
Why are you down there?

1070
01:14:10,797 --> 01:14:13,967
Eh? Just thinking. About who's on my side.

1071
01:14:14,601 --> 01:14:17,804
-Has your memory still not returned? -I don't know who it is.

1072
01:14:17,937 --> 01:14:22,942
-It's not that...! -I also...

1073
01:14:37,390 --> 01:14:41,828
But in the drawing, the feet were big. Because it was green, I said it was Jae Suk hyung.

1074
01:14:41,928 --> 01:14:43,329
Hobbit!

1075
01:14:45,965 --> 01:14:48,568
Hyung! His feet alone are 280!

1076
01:14:48,635 --> 01:14:51,771
-And also, the stuff here... -Exactly...

1077
01:14:51,771 --> 01:14:54,340
-It's HaHa. -HaHa. he takes. his glasses on and off.

1078
01:14:55,942 --> 01:14:57,777
-That's right.7-Yeah.

1079
01:14:57,844 --> 01:14:59,412
And his feet are just big.

1080
01:15:03,483 --> 01:15:05,351
It’s really not me?

1081
01:15:05,351 --> 01:15:08,254
Ignoring that, I'd be very happy if it were me...

1082
01:15:10,790 --> 01:15:12,358
Dong Hoon-

1083
01:15:15,128 --> 01:15:16,262
How is it that...

1084
01:15:17,430 --> 01:15:19,399
Has your memory returned?

1085
01:15:20,667 --> 01:15:21,801
I...

1086
01:15:29,275 --> 01:15:31,411
I really don't know who it's.

1087
01:15:32,212 --> 01:15:35,315
I told you. Today I am Yang Myeong.

1088
01:15:37,951 --> 01:15:39,486
There's no way that it is me.

1089
01:15:42,188 --> 01:15:44,724
-It's not you, oppa? -Because I was Yang Myeong from the very beginning.

1090
01:15:45,458 --> 01:15:48,428
-Then who is it? -I am working to get your memory back.

1091
01:15:53,933 --> 01:15:55,702
Then...

1092
01:15:56,102 --> 01:15:58,805
-Shall we see the notebooks again...? -Shall we?’

1093
01:16:00,907 --> 01:16:03,910
I hid them really well.

1094
01:16:04,344 --> 01:16:06,813
Where did you hide them?

1095
01:16:14,721 --> 01:16:17,090
I hid them within the plane...

1096
01:16:17,490 --> 01:16:19,759
You hid them within the plane? Really?

1097
01:16:20,326 --> 01:16:22,729
Where inside the plane is there a hiding spot...?

1098
01:16:22,829 --> 01:16:25,632
If it's inside the plane, we need to go that way.

1099
01:16:33,573 --> 01:16:35,742
Ga In-ssi, do you really not know?

1100
01:16:35,875 --> 01:16:40,246
-I'm Yang Myeong-gun! Today my role is Yang Myeong-gun! -He's Yang Myeong-gun!

1101
01:16:40,413 --> 01:16:41,714
Yang Maeng-

1102
01:16:41,981 --> 01:16:46,619
Ah Yeon Woo. Your memory has to return! Your memory!

1103
01:17:26,059 --> 01:17:29,062
Maiden Yeon Woo... you have to take this, too...

1104
01:17:30,330 --> 01:17:34,167
Maiden Yeon Woo, you have to take this, too. so you can have five.

1105
01:17:35,768 --> 01:17:38,037
Maiden Yeon Woo, you have to take this, too.

1106
01:17:44,811 --> 01:17:46,946
He's coming, he's coming.

1107
01:17:47,046 --> 01:17:48,615
Who ripped your tag off?

1108
01:17:48,648 --> 01:17:51,084
Hyung! I got mine ripped off my Ga In-ssi!

1109
01:17:51,184 --> 01:17:52,819
-Hyung! -As it should be.

1110
01:17:52,852 --> 01:17:54,954
-I'm Yang Myeong. -What?

1111
01:17:55,288 --> 01:17:57,657
I'm Yang Myeong-gun.

1112
01:17:58,291 --> 01:18:01,094
You're not Yang Myeong-gun. You're fool-gun.

1113
01:18:02,562 --> 01:18:07,367
-Hyung! I know. I figured everything out. -Hey, you...! OK...

1114
01:18:07,934 --> 01:18:10,169
I deduced it amazingly once again.

1115
01:18:10,236 --> 01:18:13,306
-It s HaHa isn't it. -I figured out it was HaHa.

1116
01:18:14,073 --> 01:18:16,509
Why is your mouth so alive in jail?

1117
01:18:18,645 --> 01:18:22,215
After ripping mine off for no reason, you're doing well, doing well-

1118
01:18:23,783 --> 01:18:28,321
You're just condiments, condiments!

1119
01:18:33,192 --> 01:18:37,096
He wasn't wearing glasses and he was wearing green.

1120
01:18:38,231 --> 01:18:39,899
-He dances well. -Green!

1121
01:18:39,999 --> 01:18:42,468
He was holding a mic.

1122
01:18:44,003 --> 01:18:46,272
-I'm also green.. -It's one of you two.

1123
01:18:46,539 --> 01:18:48,574
I'll go look at them.

1124
01:18:49,008 --> 01:18:53,146
-I hid them. -Where? The plane? Tell me where. I'll go look at them by myself.

1125
01:18:53,680 --> 01:18:59,852
Inside the plane, there are a lot seats. I hid them beneath the seats.

1126
01:19:12,465 --> 01:19:14,367
Where are they?

1127
01:19:27,980 --> 01:19:30,817
What?!

1128
01:19:31,851 --> 01:19:33,519
Hey, what are you doing?!

1129
01:19:34,053 --> 01:19:35,955
Hyung, I'm sorry. I'm her first love.

1130
01:19:35,988 --> 01:19:38,091
No way! It's me!

1131
01:19:38,357 --> 01:19:39,792
I tell you. it's me!

1132
01:19:39,892 --> 01:19:43,262
It's me! See this!

1133
01:19:43,262 --> 01:19:45,331
It's not. I'm sorry.

1134
01:19:45,431 --> 01:19:50,103
-It's me! -You're not, hyung. Ask Ga In.

1135
01:19:50,536 --> 01:19:53,039
-I'm sorry, oppa, -I tell you, it's me!

1136
01:19:53,106 --> 01:19:55,208
-It’s not! -Hey, glasses! Sunglasses!

1137
01:19:55,208 --> 01:19:56,943
Please!

1138
01:19:57,376 --> 01:19:58,711
We're sorry.

1139
01:19:58,778 --> 01:20:01,247
Gary. out! Gary. out!

1140
01:20:01,347 --> 01:20:04,150
There's no need for you to lip sync that, is there?

1141
01:20:15,795 --> 01:20:18,197
How long will we continue this?

1142
01:20:18,831 --> 01:20:21,234
My dear says her legs hurt-!

1143
01:20:21,234 --> 01:20:23,369
Ah, you scared me!

1144
01:20:23,603 --> 01:20:25,471
Hey, you all...

1145
01:20:25,805 --> 01:20:28,074
Ahh, so scary... Ah, Ga I n-ssi.

1146
01:20:28,241 --> 01:20:30,610
This is embarrassing as your first love.

1147
01:20:30,610 --> 01:20:33,246
You're showing us many sides of you.

1148
01:20:46,392 --> 01:20:47,794
Ga In-ssi!

1149
01:20:47,960 --> 01:20:50,096
Please protect me!

1150
01:20:54,600 --> 01:20:57,503
Ah Who's this?

1151
01:20:57,603 --> 01:20:59,472
Ah, have you finally come?

1152
01:20:59,572 --> 01:21:02,942
-So? -Ga In-ssi! Ga In-ssi!

1153
01:21:02,975 --> 01:21:05,077
Quickly, quickly, quickly, quickly! Qu ckly tear it off!

1154
01:21:05,111 --> 01:21:07,547
Ga In-ssi! Ga in-ssl! She's...!

1155
01:21:07,613 --> 01:21:10,449
Oh, so scary! So scary! Please tear it off quickly!

1156
01:21:10,516 --> 01:21:13,486
Ga In-ssi! Please tear it off! You don't understand how scary she is!

1157
01:21:13,519 --> 01:21:16,989
Please help! Oh, you've nearly gotten it! We've won, we've won! Come on Ji Hyo, please!

1158
01:21:17,023 --> 01:21:20,693
Oh, she's scary! She's hitting me! See. see! She’s kicking me!

1159
01:21:20,693 --> 01:21:23,396
No, this can't continue, ack!

1160
01:21:23,563 --> 01:21:25,298
How dare you...!

1161
01:21:31,604 --> 01:21:34,607
Ah. so scary!

1162
01:21:35,274 --> 01:21:38,044
Hey! Hey! Hey!

1163
01:21:38,077 --> 01:21:40,112
Sorry that I cannot be your first love!

1164
01:21:41,948 --> 01:21:43,916
She protected me!

1165
01:21:44,250 --> 01:21:46,953
My first love protected me!

1166
01:21:49,722 --> 01:21:51,123
-What's this? -Oh, what's this here?

1167
01:21:51,190 --> 01:21:53,159
I think we have to go there?

1168
01:21:53,492 --> 01:21:55,061
What's this?

1169
01:21:55,561 --> 01:21:57,463
Shall we rip it off? Do we have to?

1170
01:21:58,030 --> 01:22:00,466
Ah! This!

1171
01:22:01,767 --> 01:22:04,370
Because they told us to find five.

1172
01:22:05,404 --> 01:22:07,840
Jong Kook oppa here, because he helped us the most.

1173
01:22:08,207 --> 01:22:10,676
One, two, three!

1174
01:22:16,549 --> 01:22:17,683
What's that?

1175
01:22:29,295 --> 01:22:31,898
Because they told us to find five.

1176
01:22:32,932 --> 01:22:35,368
Jong Kook oppa here, because he helped us the most.

1177
01:22:35,735 --> 01:22:38,204
One, two, three!

1178
01:22:44,076 --> 01:22:44,944
What's that?

1179
01:22:44,944 --> 01:22:45,211
What's this?
What's that?

1180
01:22:45,211 --> 01:22:46,312
What's this?

1181
01:22:58,691 --> 01:23:01,460
Let's hide everything! Because It's ours!

1182
01:23:02,061 --> 01:23:05,564
-What's that? -It's here! It’s here!

1183
01:23:05,765 --> 01:23:07,166
-There's something here. -What is that?

1184
01:23:08,134 --> 01:23:11,037
-That's that thing! -A vitamin container.

1185
01:23:11,037 --> 01:23:13,139
Back then, we did a lot of stuff like this in that container.

1186
01:23:13,205 --> 01:23:16,475
-What's this? -I remember! I remember!

1187
01:23:17,410 --> 01:23:18,678
I really remember!

1188
01:23:18,711 --> 01:23:24,250
-What do you remember? -Actually, I wanted to sit with you. Let's be good friends. From Ga In.

1189
01:23:24,417 --> 01:23:28,154
-No way, no way! I wrote that! -I remember this! 1 remember this!

1190
01:23:29,789 --> 01:23:33,592
-That's the real thing, the real thing! -Gold!

1191
01:23:34,794 --> 01:23:36,595
Good job!

1192
01:23:36,896 --> 01:23:40,232
Here, you take one. and I take one.

1193
01:23:40,232 --> 01:23:42,435
-Is this real gold? -It's real gold. Real.

1194
01:23:42,468 --> 01:23:43,903
-It’s real gold. -Real gold?

1195
01:23:44,003 --> 01:23:46,706
You really like it!

1196
01:23:46,706 --> 01:23:49,442
Since my first love gave this to me...

1197
01:23:50,509 --> 01:23:53,579
-You., have it all. -You're manly!

1198
01:23:54,747 --> 01:23:56,849
Manly! Manly!

1199
01:23:56,949 --> 01:23:59,919
Hey, why are you crying?! Why are you crying after giving her the gold?!

1200
01:23:59,986 --> 01:24:01,554
Why are you crying?!

1201
01:24:01,654 --> 01:24:07,059
The forgotten memory. First Love. Han Ga In. HaHa!

1202
01:24:12,898 --> 01:24:15,034
This Is more nerve wracking than live TV.

1203
01:24:19,205 --> 01:24:20,673
This, this is the code.

1204
01:24:21,107 --> 01:24:22,174
Is this a Western alphabet?

1205
01:24:22,341 --> 01:24:23,476
How'd you find that?

1206
01:24:23,476 --> 01:24:23,609
Suk Jin hyung!
How'd you find that?

1207
01:24:23,609 --> 01:24:24,744
Suk Jin hyung!

1208
01:24:26,479 --> 01:24:28,347
It's within this radlus?

1209
01:24:29,081 --> 01:24:30,516
Gwang Soo!
