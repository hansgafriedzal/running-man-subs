1
00:00:08,159 --> 00:00:10,127
I found it!

2
00:00:32,683 --> 00:00:34,885
We are at Jeju island!

3
00:00:36,153 --> 00:00:37,555
Jeju island.

4
00:00:38,823 --> 00:00:41,625
It was so windy and rainy yesterday.

5
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:45,196
-Right now, the weather's nice -Its so nice today though.

6
00:00:45,663 --> 00:00:48,532
-If you put a feather it'll just fall right back down -Exactly.

7
00:00:49,633 --> 00:00:51,035
Come back here come back.

8
00:00:53,704 --> 00:00:55,506
Come back here come back.

9
00:00:56,173 --> 00:00:57,942
It's not time for something like that.

10
00:00:58,242 --> 00:01:01,212
There are no extra cameras to film you doing that right now.

11
00:01:03,214 --> 00:01:05,549
He wants to play right now.

12
00:01:06,484 --> 00:01:08,285
Aren't you supposed to be playing like this in Jeju.

13
00:01:08,285 --> 00:01:12,423
Oh gosh. Is the people who are going to be with us coming?

14
00:01:12,423 --> 00:01:16,093
There are other people who are going to join us for running man today.

15
00:01:16,093 --> 00:01:17,695
Two?

16
00:01:18,596 --> 00:01:19,730
Musical fairy.

17
00:01:20,264 --> 00:01:21,232
Fairy?

18
00:01:21,232 --> 00:01:23,234
Usical fairy??

19
00:01:23,434 --> 00:01:25,536
They're coming over there.

20
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:28,672
They're coming in that carriage.

21
00:01:32,643 --> 00:01:34,045
They're hiding over there.

22
00:01:44,422 --> 00:01:46,190
They're so small, like this small.

23
00:01:46,624 --> 00:01:48,292
Tinkerbell Tinkerbell.

24
00:01:49,994 --> 00:01:51,095
Something weird.

25
00:01:51,095 --> 00:01:55,066
Something's weird, is it Minsoo again?

26
00:01:55,066 --> 00:01:56,834
It seems kind of weird right?

27
00:01:57,902 --> 00:01:59,770
Is it Dong Wan Fd?

28
00:02:01,772 --> 00:02:03,874
Is it Joon San?

29
00:02:05,276 --> 00:02:06,410
They seem a little old.

30
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:07,711
They look old.

31
00:02:07,711 --> 00:02:09,880
They can't be a musical fairies.

32
00:02:10,614 --> 00:02:11,715
Is this Shin Bong sun?

33
00:02:22,493 --> 00:02:24,962
It's Jung Jae Hyung!

34
00:02:26,831 --> 00:02:28,365
What is this all of a sudden, what is this?

35
00:02:28,365 --> 00:02:29,900
Jung Jae Hyung!

36
00:02:32,136 --> 00:02:33,904
Oh the musical fairy

37
00:02:35,573 --> 00:02:38,042
I talked to you yesterday but you didn't tell me this?

38
00:02:38,676 --> 00:02:41,145
They said to keep it a secret.

39
00:02:44,715 --> 00:02:45,983
Didn’t you drink last night.

40
00:02:45,983 --> 00:02:48,252
Me? no.

41
00:02:48,252 --> 00:02:52,523
-There's Jihyo right behind you -Oh hello.

42
00:02:55,226 --> 00:02:59,463
He's going to get caught for running man real quick.

43
00:03:00,631 --> 00:03:06,170
He came out on a show and got sick for three days.

44
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:08,272
How could you call someone like this?

45
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:11,442
Will the last person come out?

46
00:03:33,831 --> 00:03:35,232
BoA?!

47
00:03:40,704 --> 00:03:42,873
BoA?

48
00:03:55,052 --> 00:03:57,655
It's so nice to see her.

49
00:03:58,722 --> 00:04:00,591
Wow it's BoA.

50
00:04:08,132 --> 00:04:09,533
Hey!

51
00:04:11,502 --> 00:04:15,506
Wow really, I didn't know BoA would come here

52
00:04:15,506 --> 00:04:18,075
I know I was so surprised....Look at me(joke)

53
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:21,345
-Piss me off... -Piss me off too.

54
00:04:27,751 --> 00:04:29,653
BoA said it's her first time on a reality show

55
00:04:29,653 --> 00:04:30,554
-0h really? -Yeeah.

56
00:04:30,554 --> 00:04:31,722
This is your first time?

57
00:04:31,722 --> 00:04:33,490
You're lacking

58
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:38,462
I'm so used to this right now.

59
00:04:39,563 --> 00:04:42,399
-Just look at the camera well -Where is it?

60
00:04:43,434 --> 00:04:47,004
So this is your first variety show?

61
00:04:47,004 --> 00:04:48,205
Yeah, it's my first time meeting you like this.

62
00:04:48,205 --> 00:04:49,373
You're. right.

63
00:04:50,174 --> 00:04:53,844
Yeah, we've never .done a*show? together, :.

64
00:04:53,844 --> 00:04:55,512
She said she's nervous.

65
00:04:55,512 --> 00:04:56,280
Yeah I am.

66
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,015
Has Haha done a show with her before?

67
00:04:58,015 --> 00:04:59,149
-Yes I have -Oh when?

68
00:04:59,149 --> 00:05:00,851
On a radio station.

69
00:05:07,491 --> 00:05:09,393
She doesn't remember.

70
00:05:12,863 --> 00:05:17,801
Anyways, BoA and Jae Hyung is here today.

71
00:05:18,836 --> 00:05:24,875
Before we start the mission the two guests will chose their own team and it will be simple,

72
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:30,114
Since we are at the beach day, we are going to play catch me if you can

73
00:05:30,514 --> 00:05:34,151
and each running man character will go get the flag.

74
00:05:34,585 --> 00:05:39,823
Who ever gets and tags them first will get to be on that persons team.

75
00:05:39,823 --> 00:05:42,459
It will be so awkward if that person runs alone.

76
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:47,164
Gwang soo will be running first.

77
00:05:47,164 --> 00:05:49,633
Why me first?

78
00:05:49,633 --> 00:05:51,402
I think he likes running around.

79
00:05:51,402 --> 00:05:52,603
No no.

80
00:05:52,603 --> 00:05:54,071
How awkward.

81
00:05:54,772 --> 00:05:58,375
First off, is Gang zoo.

82
00:06:00,244 --> 00:06:02,513
First off, is Gang zoo.

83
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,782
Ready, start.

84
00:06:04,782 --> 00:06:08,185
Catch me if you can.

85
00:06:20,664 --> 00:06:24,735
-You should run slower -You look like a crow.

86
00:06:28,605 --> 00:06:31,141
No ones even moving.

87
00:06:33,143 --> 00:06:35,045
Next, Haha.

88
00:06:41,085 --> 00:06:42,486
Ready, start.

89
00:06:42,753 --> 00:06:45,422
Catch me if you can.

90
00:06:46,623 --> 00:06:52,229
Catch me if you can, catch me if you can.

91
00:06:54,064 --> 00:06:57,334
Not you.

92
00:06:58,502 --> 00:07:00,971
Catch me if you can -He's going he's going.

93
00:07:00,971 --> 00:07:13,784
No, not you. No I don't want to.

94
00:07:20,624 --> 00:07:24,261
You guys look good together.

95
00:07:24,261 --> 00:07:26,663
So funny really

96
00:07:27,331 --> 00:07:29,166
I don’t want to.

97
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,002
Next is.

98
00:07:33,904 --> 00:07:39,410
Catch me if you can. Catch me*if you can.

99
00:07:40,144 --> 00:07:41,445
BoA!

100
00:07:41,445 --> 00:07:42,980
Just keep on going.

101
00:07:45,315 --> 00:07:48,352
Feel - chok - cross!

102
00:07:51,021 --> 00:07:53,824
Catch me if you can.

103
00:07:57,895 --> 00:08:01,765
My face is getting red.

104
00:08:11,542 --> 00:08:12,743
She caught him.

105
00:08:13,744 --> 00:08:14,845
She caught him.

106
00:08:18,615 --> 00:08:19,750
Jihyo ready.

107
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:22,519
Catch me if you can.

108
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:27,591
Hey Jihyo.

109
00:08:27,591 --> 00:08:29,560
Just go.

110
00:08:34,865 --> 00:08:36,533
Gwang soo!

111
00:08:42,206 --> 00:08:45,476
Catch me if you can.

112
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:54,885
We're going. We're going.

113
00:09:19,643 --> 00:09:26,550
Todays mission is to figure out the running man code.

114
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:27,684
Code?

115
00:09:30,354 --> 00:09:32,122
You have to use your head.

116
00:09:32,422 --> 00:09:39,396
If you figure it out correctly, you will! find the running man code.

117
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:57,814
This is the code right?

118
00:09:59,316 --> 00:10:00,851
This is a trick.

119
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:09,593
Oh you just click the flag and something pops up.

120
00:10:13,063 --> 00:10:19,703
Find the running man file in the green yard.

121
00:10:21,572 --> 00:10:23,574
-Are you sure? -Its at’ln-sah dong.

122
00:10:23,574 --> 00:10:26,176
No no that's not right.

123
00:10:27,444 --> 00:10:29,913
It's that place we went to before.

124
00:10:30,514 --> 00:10:31,582
Okay!

125
00:10:44,294 --> 00:10:47,464
Gary, isn't this a little too tight?

126
00:10:47,464 --> 00:10:48,832
No no its okay.

127
00:10:48,832 --> 00:10:50,334
Why are you like this, I'm comfortable.

128
00:10:55,572 --> 00:10:58,942
BoA is uncomfortable too, the chair went too back.

129
00:11:02,112 --> 00:11:07,651
We need to be comfortable for BoA to be comfortable too.

130
00:11:08,185 --> 00:11:09,920
She's so charismatic.

131
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:10,921
No I'm not.

132
00:11:10,921 --> 00:11:12,189
She has so much aura.

133
00:11:12,189 --> 00:11:13,390
Aura?

134
00:11:16,994 --> 00:11:19,463
I'm so nervous.

135
00:11:21,031 --> 00:11:25,202
Let's be number one today like BoA's song.

136
00:11:25,202 --> 00:11:26,370
-Yes yes -Yeah that's good.

137
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:31,141
We lost Gary in our team last time and lost.

138
00:11:31,141 --> 00:11:32,442
Oh really?

139
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:35,846
But why is your name Gary.

140
00:11:35,846 --> 00:11:50,894
Ah, my name?, when I was younger that used to be my nickname but now that I'm a rapper and I needed a nickname.

141
00:11:50,894 --> 00:11:51,995
So you just added lee

142
00:11:51,995 --> 00:11:52,929
Lee.

143
00:11:55,632 --> 00:12:00,203
Since Jae Hyung is smart, he can figure codes out.

144
00:12:00,203 --> 00:12:02,439
Of course, just trust me.

145
00:12:03,974 --> 00:12:08,745
Oh and that .. what was her name, the girl.

146
00:12:08,745 --> 00:12:10,714
The girl.

147
00:12:10,714 --> 00:12:11,415
Song Jihyo?

148
00:12:11,415 --> 00:12:12,783
Yeah Jihyo.

149
00:12:13,884 --> 00:12:17,354
If she was here, you would be in trouble right now.

150
00:12:18,121 --> 00:12:19,089
Oh really?

151
00:12:20,824 --> 00:12:23,593
Got my hair pulled at before.

152
00:12:24,995 --> 00:12:26,229
Oh good good

153
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:28,365
I like talking with my knees bent.

154
00:12:37,674 --> 00:12:38,875
Its here.

155
00:12:41,244 --> 00:12:43,580
It's the yellow running man.

156
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:44,915
Right,

157
00:12:53,924 --> 00:12:54,825
Miss Bo.

158
00:13:15,045 --> 00:13:16,713
How are they here before us?

159
00:13:17,914 --> 00:13:21,284
Be careful because you're more special than us.

160
00:13:27,791 --> 00:13:29,126
I, 2

161
00:13:29,126 --> 00:13:30,360

163
00:13:32,195 --> 00:13:32,996
Yeah yeah.

164
00:13:32,996 --> 00:13:34,431
Go now.

165
00:13:34,431 --> 00:13:35,632
The code?

166
00:13:36,299 --> 00:13:37,701
Wait what?

167
00:13:38,401 --> 00:13:39,703
What's over there?

168
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:43,373
-Whats over there? -Go find the code?

169
00:13:45,976 --> 00:13:47,544
There's something in the flag.

170
00:13:52,115 --> 00:13:53,984
This is green tea?

171
00:13:53,984 --> 00:13:55,185
What is this?

172
00:14:00,624 --> 00:14:03,560
Hey hurry up and find it Oppa.

173
00:14:07,964 --> 00:14:10,433
There’s nothing here.

174
00:14:10,934 --> 00:14:12,369
There's nothing.

175
00:14:12,369 --> 00:14:14,704
There's nothing here, this is fake

176
00:14:26,082 --> 00:14:27,050
Gary!

177
00:14:30,153 --> 00:14:34,024
Come here, come over there

178
00:14:39,729 --> 00:14:41,231
I found it!

179
00:14:41,631 --> 00:14:42,699
Is that real?

180
00:14:51,675 --> 00:14:53,076
This is by Jong kook.

181
00:14:55,679 --> 00:14:56,980
Did you find it?

182
00:14:57,614 --> 00:14:58,949
Amazing Amazing.

183
00:14:59,749 --> 00:15:02,052
This is some kind of code.

184
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,229
What is that piano for?

185
00:15:18,401 --> 00:15:19,970
You have to perform it huh?

186
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:22,906
And sing it, is there anyone who plays the piano?

187
00:15:22,906 --> 00:15:24,140
I can play it a little bit.

188
00:15:24,374 --> 00:15:26,543
But these seem kind of hard, the chords.

189
00:15:26,543 --> 00:15:28,345
You just need the melody.

190
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:32,282
We're doing a song by Jung Jae Hyung.

191
00:15:32,282 --> 00:15:34,284
Jae Hyung.

192
00:15:39,489 --> 00:15:41,491
How do you do this?

193
00:15:42,759 --> 00:15:44,761
You have to perform for it to come out.

194
00:15:45,095 --> 00:15:46,363
But what is this.

195
00:15:46,363 --> 00:15:48,365
If you do the mission, the box opens.

196
00:15:48,565 --> 00:15:55,805
Yes, you must do the performance first.

197
00:16:02,212 --> 00:16:04,514
Go over there.

198
00:16:05,682 --> 00:16:07,250
BoA can do it.

199
00:16:34,644 --> 00:16:35,879
Is that all?

200
00:16:35,879 --> 00:16:37,414
It says you got it wrong.

201
00:16:38,114 --> 00:16:40,784
They got it wrong.

202
00:16:41,484 --> 00:16:43,420
This is Jeju green tea.

203
00:16:43,753 --> 00:16:45,155
This is Jeju tea?

204
00:16:47,724 --> 00:16:49,025
This is so sweet.

205
00:16:52,462 --> 00:16:55,231
At this rate, we won't even find the code.

206
00:16:55,231 --> 00:16:56,933
This isn't easy.

207
00:16:56,933 --> 00:16:59,269
They're singing over there

208
00:16:59,636 --> 00:17:01,371
I think they're finding musical notes.

209
00:17:05,275 --> 00:17:07,811
It's over there! over there.

210
00:17:07,811 --> 00:17:12,415
Over there the red thing. There's more over there, over there.

211
00:17:14,784 --> 00:17:15,986
These are blank.

212
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,389
There are real ones and fake ones.

213
00:17:21,624 --> 00:17:24,394
It's so cold.

214
00:17:30,834 --> 00:17:32,302
This is blank too.

215
00:17:38,274 --> 00:17:40,043
So cold even my undergarments are wet.

216
00:17:41,711 --> 00:17:43,246
This is not a time to look nice.

217
00:17:46,282 --> 00:17:48,918
There's one here, over here.

218
00:17:54,724 --> 00:17:56,426
Oh Shang lee jeh, ah, this..

219
00:18:02,766 --> 00:18:04,434
But you have to sing the lyrics.

220
00:18:11,574 --> 00:18:13,410
Try playing something else.

221
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:15,145
Something else? what else?

222
00:18:19,983 --> 00:18:22,485
Oh my gosh.

223
00:18:36,933 --> 00:18:39,002
This is amazing, amazing.

224
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:08,164
If you're not going to do the mission then another team...

225
00:19:08,164 --> 00:19:10,233
- No no - We will.

226
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:13,169
You have to do that song.

227
00:19:13,169 --> 00:19:14,804
Oh this song?

228
00:19:14,804 --> 00:19:16,773
They didn't finish.

229
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:18,675
This is a party.

230
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:22,846
Hey! Do you wanna party in tears?

231
00:19:23,913 --> 00:19:25,315
Do you wanna party in tears?

232
00:19:25,315 --> 00:19:27,584
We are freezing over here.

233
00:19:29,052 --> 00:19:32,155
Can you do it in a domestic style?

234
00:19:33,723 --> 00:19:36,993
No it isn’t. This is like a Paris style.

235
00:19:39,295 --> 00:19:46,569
We should do a modern style.

236
00:19:50,039 --> 00:19:52,175
Back to the challenge.

237
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:56,679
We are number one!

238
00:20:05,889 --> 00:20:06,623
This one.

239
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:08,958
Here it goes.

240
00:20:23,173 --> 00:20:25,675
Oh shanzelize.

241
00:20:27,043 --> 00:20:29,746
Oh shanzelize

242
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:36,719
!@♪$%A&*

243
00:20:36,819 --> 00:20:38,555
OH shanzelize.

244
00:20:39,088 --> 00:20:39,455
Oh.

245
00:20:42,759 --> 00:20:43,459
Success.

246
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:44,594
Success.

247
00:20:45,094 --> 00:20:46,663
You failed so please go back.

248
00:20:46,863 --> 00:20:48,431
I’m getting pissed off.

249
00:20:48,998 --> 00:20:50,800
They failed

250
00:20:51,334 --> 00:20:53,870
I think it has nothing to do with the play and the singing.

251
00:20:55,205 --> 00:20:56,839
Is there something...

252
00:20:57,273 --> 00:20:58,274
Is there a password...?

253
00:20:58,274 --> 00:20:59,342
Shanzelize.

254
00:21:00,143 --> 00:21:05,114
Is it something separated with the piano chord B, C?

255
00:21:08,384 --> 00:21:13,623
Because they did not only write French but translated in Korean like blue ballad.

256
00:21:17,093 --> 00:21:18,494
It is not detailed so it is not something big.

257
00:21:19,629 --> 00:21:22,031
The other teams are having a hard time too.

258
00:21:22,031 --> 00:21:23,833
And how will Gwang soo’s team do it?

259
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:29,639
Hyung let’s not succeed this.

260
00:21:29,973 --> 00:21:31,674
-Yeah' action -Yeah let’s do actions.

261
00:21:31,774 --> 00:21:32,976
Let’s do together with actions.

262
00:21:33,109 --> 00:21:34,110
Start!

263
00:21:34,611 --> 00:21:36,779
It’s winter.

264
00:21:36,879 --> 00:21:42,952
The weather is cold.

265
00:21:43,119 --> 00:21:45,622
Every time it is cold.

266
00:21:45,788 --> 00:21:49,325
If there is something like that.

267
00:21:49,425 --> 00:21:53,730
It is hard to remember that thing.

268
00:21:54,163 --> 00:21:57,934
We feel sad.

269
00:21:58,901 --> 00:22:01,504
Fail! It’s sad but contestant number 3.

270
00:22:01,504 --> 00:22:02,105
Yes.

271
00:22:02,105 --> 00:22:04,774
Ah Our director did well with them.

272
00:22:04,974 --> 00:22:07,210
-We will come back next time Yes-Come back next time.

273
00:22:07,343 --> 00:22:13,883
This team did their best

274
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:15,485
I was in the other team.

275
00:22:15,485 --> 00:22:17,353
Aren’t you a giraffe? A giraffe

276
00:22:17,754 --> 00:22:18,755
I am a person.

277
00:22:19,922 --> 00:22:21,391
Bring our music sheet.

278
00:22:21,724 --> 00:22:22,859
Bring it.

279
00:22:23,493 --> 00:22:25,862
Number 3 the national park team.

280
00:22:26,462 --> 00:22:27,430
The giraffe

281
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:28,831
I am a person, I can talk too.

282
00:22:28,831 --> 00:22:30,800
Maybe the giraffe has an IQ.

283
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:31,934
He plays the piano.

284
00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:35,104
Sol La.

285
00:22:35,505 --> 00:22:37,473
Sol La Damn.

286
00:22:39,809 --> 00:22:41,411
Hyung I think BoA will curse.

287
00:22:41,811 --> 00:22:43,146
She said Damn now.

288
00:22:43,446 --> 00:22:45,315
If we bug her more.

289
00:22:45,615 --> 00:22:50,953
We were team with beauties right?

290
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,889
-Yes -They get a bit angry but.

291
00:22:52,889 --> 00:22:58,494
If we wait more she will say her first bad word.

292
00:22:58,661 --> 00:23:00,029
The fresh bad word...

293
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:02,999
A bit more You can say it.

294
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:06,703
It is her first time in a variety and she says a fresh bad word.

295
00:23:06,703 --> 00:23:08,805
Damn is also fresh-

296
00:23:10,206 --> 00:23:12,875
Ah! Because of this Pumpa I am going crazy.

297
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:16,145
BoA is doing it! Finally!

298
00:23:16,779 --> 00:23:17,580
Finally BoA.

299
00:23:18,081 --> 00:23:20,583
Stop it! There is someone from France.

300
00:23:20,683 --> 00:23:21,384
Ah yes.

301
00:23:21,484 --> 00:23:22,885
Please proceed faster

302
00:23:23,252 --> 00:23:25,021
I am sorry because of my flight time that’s why.

303
00:23:26,289 --> 00:23:27,523
Are you from France?

304
00:23:27,523 --> 00:23:28,858

I will play now.

308
00:23:33,296 --> 00:23:36,999
Following the road and stepping on it.

309
00:23:37,233 --> 00:23:40,703
Coming home together.

310
00:23:40,903 --> 00:23:44,374
Goes out with the carpenter.

311
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,844
Goes home together.

312
00:23:47,844 --> 00:23:48,244

You startled me.

If we bug her more she will lie down in the grass

317
00:24:07,463 --> 00:24:09,866
I think I will go crazy!

318
00:24:10,066 --> 00:24:11,934
Did you hear it?!

319
00:24:12,034 --> 00:24:14,404
-You should at least give us a hint -What, Did you call me?

320
00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:15,872
What are you?

321
00:24:16,372 --> 00:24:17,373
Just go!

322
00:24:17,373 --> 00:24:18,941
Still my number 1.

323
00:24:19,008 --> 00:24:21,544
Oppa, I think I am going to be crazy!

324
00:24:22,311 --> 00:24:22,912
Why?

325
00:24:23,079 --> 00:24:24,480
I really don’t know what they are telling us to do...

326
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,583
-I will tell you -BoA is very angry right now.

327
00:24:27,984 --> 00:24:29,385
BoA-ssi look at us doing it.

328
00:24:30,052 --> 00:24:31,754
Are you really from France?

00:24:32,021 --> 00:24:33,489
Yes...

330
00:24:36,058 --> 00:24:36,859
What are you doing?

331
00:24:38,094 --> 00:24:41,664
They are greeting each other.

332
00:24:42,231 --> 00:24:43,466
Okay now we understand.

333
00:24:52,208 --> 00:24:55,244
Oh Shanzelize.

Running man Code.

339
00:25:15,031 --> 00:25:17,066
There must be something in it.

340
00:25:18,134 --> 00:25:19,035
Maybe in the lyrics.

341
00:25:23,339 --> 00:25:24,474
In a Elize hills.

342
00:25:25,775 --> 00:25:28,444
It is somewhere in the hills.

343
00:25:31,013 --> 00:25:32,215
Bbo Ah-

344
00:25:37,019 --> 00:25:39,755
Did you find that?

345
00:25:47,263 --> 00:25:49,398
Hey! Wait!

346
00:25:49,899 --> 00:25:52,468
In the lyrics there is La.

347
00:26:02,879 --> 00:26:04,981
La La La La.

348
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:09,151
Wait. Give me a ball pen.

349
00:26:11,053 --> 00:26:11,754
La La La.

350
00:26:18,461 --> 00:26:19,428
Must not get a mistake even once.

351
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:32,441
No need to hurry.

352
00:26:34,911 --> 00:26:35,978
Oppa this is really...

353
00:26:36,112 --> 00:26:37,213
If we do this we will succeed.

354
00:26:37,213 --> 00:26:37,914
Okay.

355
00:26:39,148 --> 00:26:42,718
Following the road and stepping on it-

356
00:26:43,052 --> 00:26:46,055
Coming home together.

357
00:26:46,055 --> 00:26:49,258
Goes out with the carpenter.

358
00:26:49,659 --> 00:26:52,361
Goes home together.

359
00:26:52,895 --> 00:27:00,403

It’s daebak!

363
00:27:19,555 --> 00:27:20,790
There must be a clue

364
00:27:21,924 --> 00:27:23,492
I do not know what that is.

365
00:27:25,261 --> 00:27:26,429
Something fell.

366
00:27:32,001 --> 00:27:33,035
It opened?

367
00:27:33,035 --> 00:27:33,903
Succeeded?

368
00:27:35,304 --> 00:27:35,972
Let’s go.

369
00:27:35,972 --> 00:27:37,373
Yeah.

370
00:27:39,442 --> 00:27:40,743
Hyung how did you find that out?

371
00:27:40,743 --> 00:27:41,944
How did you know?"

372
00:27:44,614 --> 00:27:46,248
The next place is.

373
00:27:47,016 --> 00:27:48,684
Wait with this...

374
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:56,258
oh?! San Rok Nam Ro 776, Find the running man drawing.

375
00:27:56,892 --> 00:27:58,794
Ah-Anyways we are the first.

376
00:27:59,095 --> 00:28:00,663
The other teams will catch up.

377
00:28:02,365 --> 00:28:02,999
How about this?

378
00:28:02,999 --> 00:28:04,700
There are notes here-

379
00:28:05,101 --> 00:28:11,240
Like here you press La and Do

380
00:28:11,273 --> 00:28:12,341
I also thought of that

381
00:28:12,341 --> 00:28:14,744
I think this is the secret code.

382
00:28:15,511 --> 00:28:16,712
This is sol.

383
00:28:17,413 --> 00:28:20,650
Sol Re Mi.

384
00:28:21,884 --> 00:28:22,752
This is it.

385
00:28:23,219 --> 00:28:24,353
This is the one! I am sure of it.

386
00:28:24,453 --> 00:28:27,890
-If there is a nice person please introduce to me -Maybe it is correct.

387
00:28:28,324 --> 00:28:31,394
There is also a practice when it come to love.

388
00:28:31,894 --> 00:28:37,833
Someone who looks after you even though that person is busy.

389
00:28:38,034 --> 00:28:38,501
Oh!

390
00:28:41,771 --> 00:28:42,304
Woah!

391
00:28:43,506 --> 00:28:44,173
Yes!

392
00:28:44,373 --> 00:28:45,341
Did it come out?

393
00:28:46,575 --> 00:28:47,243
We did it.

394
00:28:47,343 --> 00:28:48,010
Let’s go.

395
00:28:48,911 --> 00:28:49,879
Woah It is unbelievable.

396
00:28:51,113 --> 00:28:52,381
Our team is good at reasoning.

397
00:28:53,115 --> 00:28:53,649
Feel!

398
00:28:54,884 --> 00:28:55,351
Chok.

399
00:28:55,718 --> 00:28:56,185
Meong.

400
00:28:56,318 --> 00:28:56,919
Cross.

401
00:28:59,488 --> 00:29:01,590
It is so depressing.

402
00:29:02,858 --> 00:29:04,093
Ah-I am getting angry.

403
00:29:04,093 --> 00:29:06,762
How can you make a code like that?

404
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:10,299
You have to open the password to win.

405
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:10,800
Yeah.

406
00:29:11,333 --> 00:29:12,034
It’s okay.

407
00:29:19,642 --> 00:29:20,843
Jae hyung hyung, Close your mouth...

408
00:29:24,413 --> 00:29:25,614
My spirit went out.

409
00:29:26,315 --> 00:29:27,650
You looked pitiful

410
00:29:27,650 --> 00:29:30,086
I thought I will be first but we are the last place.

411
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:32,922
But still don’t open your mouth that much

412
00:29:32,922 --> 00:29:36,525
but going as the first place isn’t all.

413
00:29:36,959 --> 00:29:38,861
Hyung you must’ve seen it awhile ago That’s why don’t be frustrated.

414
00:29:39,729 --> 00:29:41,731
To say I got frustrated I am getting irritated...!

415
00:29:43,132 --> 00:29:45,034
Gwang soo’s expression was very sneaky.

416
00:29:45,768 --> 00:29:50,873
Little by little we will solve for the code like the Da Vinci code.

417
00:29:51,373 --> 00:29:52,374
Isn’t it the last mission place?

418
00:29:52,608 --> 00:29:54,210
-If it is like that... -I was the first place last time

419
00:29:54,844 --> 00:29:56,112
I got first place last time and you know it right?

420
00:29:56,645 --> 00:29:58,948
Gwang soo, You being the first did not become a big topic and you know it right?

421
00:29:59,582 --> 00:30:01,550
Gwang soo got scolded by his mother.

422
00:30:01,684 --> 00:30:02,752
Why were you scolded?

423
00:30:03,185 --> 00:30:05,254
Because of the prize...

424
00:30:05,254 --> 00:30:07,289
Sometimes they get gold and stuffs but that time...

425
00:30:07,289 --> 00:30:08,324
Ah the one that looks like an ashtray?

426
00:30:08,958 --> 00:30:10,059
The one that looks like an ashtray.

427
00:30:10,359 --> 00:30:12,294
There is dust there about 3cm

428
00:30:12,361 --> 00:30:13,763
agic lamp’s genie! Fulfill my wish.

429
00:30:19,568 --> 00:30:20,903
You got a great item.

430
00:30:26,175 --> 00:30:28,344
Take off Jong kook’s name tag.

431
00:30:28,978 --> 00:30:31,714
But you wouldn’t know how much it would cost.

432
00:30:31,881 --> 00:30:33,582
Yeah I don’t know.

433
00:30:33,582 --> 00:30:34,583
That’s why Gwang soo.

434
00:30:35,184 --> 00:30:36,819
It is a problem because I do not know.

435
00:30:36,819 --> 00:30:37,853
Because you do not know yet.

436
00:30:38,154 --> 00:30:39,288
We are here.

437
00:30:39,288 --> 00:30:39,889
Let’s go.

438
00:30:40,823 --> 00:30:42,458
Oh? Da Vinci?

439
00:30:42,758 --> 00:30:44,260
Da Vinci’s code?

440
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:45,194
That is correct.

441
00:30:46,662 --> 00:30:48,564
Here is Leonardo Da Vinci.

442
00:30:51,233 --> 00:30:52,201
We need to bring this along.

443
00:30:52,334 --> 00:30:54,503
Yeah you must take good care of the vault.

444
00:30:55,504 --> 00:30:56,939
Do we have to bring the vault?

445
00:30:58,140 --> 00:30:59,108
We have to bring this along?

446
00:30:59,975 --> 00:31:02,144
It is up to you whether you bring it or not.

447
00:31:03,412 --> 00:31:06,649
When we are leading we will get turn around tables... It’s a jinx

448
00:31:07,683 --> 00:31:09,051
I will bring it along.

449
00:31:09,652 --> 00:31:10,486
Let’s go in.

450
00:31:29,538 --> 00:31:30,439
Hey what is this?

451
00:31:32,541 --> 00:31:33,142
Woah.

452
00:31:34,543 --> 00:31:35,444
Oh? There is water coming out.

453
00:31:36,579 --> 00:31:37,046
What is this?

454
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:41,951
Hyung isn’t it like in the old days they do this to wash their faces?

455
00:31:42,084 --> 00:31:43,953
Leonardo Da Vinci made this-

456
00:31:45,921 --> 00:31:46,722
What is this?

457
00:31:46,722 --> 00:31:48,824
There are so many things to look at-

458
00:31:50,059 --> 00:31:50,659
What is that?

459
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:59,401
Ah.

460
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:12,948
Here it is-the flag.

461
00:32:14,383 --> 00:32:15,985
Da Vinci museum?

462
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:21,891
It must be a drawing this time.

463
00:32:22,324 --> 00:32:23,158
Wow.

464
00:32:26,228 --> 00:32:27,930
He is a very smart man.

465
00:32:29,398 --> 00:32:31,433
Da Vinci really is a smart man.

466
00:32:32,201 --> 00:32:32,635
Oh!

467
00:32:32,635 --> 00:32:33,369
You know Yun ho.

468
00:32:35,304 --> 00:32:36,739
Did You know Yun ho made this?

469
00:32:37,506 --> 00:32:38,140
A Rhino.

470
00:32:38,574 --> 00:32:41,143
Hyung last time in running man when they came out.

471
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:44,380
What did you draw?

472
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:45,114
A Rhino...

473
00:32:52,488 --> 00:32:54,056
There is something.

474
00:32:55,591 --> 00:32:57,893
Is something like this is stock.

475
00:32:57,893 --> 00:32:59,395
This is code.

476
00:33:00,429 --> 00:33:01,730
This is code.

477
00:33:11,173 --> 00:33:12,775
This is tears, Tears.

478
00:33:12,875 --> 00:33:14,410
U U

479
00:33:14,643 --> 00:33:15,911
Tears tears.

480
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:18,380
This one smiling?

481
00:33:19,648 --> 00:33:20,282
A tree?

482
00:33:20,883 --> 00:33:22,718
We will get head ache the whole day.

483
00:33:23,419 --> 00:33:24,720
What is this?

484
00:33:26,455 --> 00:33:27,623
2nd floor-

485
00:33:27,823 --> 00:33:29,258
Let’s go here.

486
00:33:30,859 --> 00:33:31,360
Oh?!

487
00:33:34,096 --> 00:33:34,363
Why?

488
00:33:35,531 --> 00:33:36,799
Here it is-Running man drawing.

489
00:33:40,436 --> 00:33:42,204
This is the one Jong Kook drew in the past

490
00:33:42,738 --> 00:33:45,074
line really look like you.

491
00:33:45,274 --> 00:33:46,008
It’s the same.

492
00:33:46,008 --> 00:33:46,542
It is right?

493
00:33:47,309 --> 00:33:49,044
Maybe we are the one finding it for the first time-

494
00:33:49,678 --> 00:33:50,145
Really?

495
00:33:52,181 --> 00:33:52,581
Feel.

496
00:33:53,048 --> 00:33:53,482
Chok.

497
00:33:53,515 --> 00:33:53,882
Meong.

498
00:33:54,016 --> 00:33:54,483
Cross.

499
00:33:55,484 --> 00:33:57,319
They told us to find something in the picture right?

500
00:33:57,319 --> 00:33:57,920
Yeah

501
00:33:58,754 --> 00:34:01,123
I really remember this-Jong kook drew it in the past.

502
00:34:01,423 --> 00:34:01,890
That’s right.

503
00:34:02,024 --> 00:34:02,925
Jae suk oppa...

504
00:34:03,125 --> 00:34:03,826
Oh! What is this.

505
00:34:07,129 --> 00:34:08,030
There is something.

506
00:34:08,764 --> 00:34:09,398
It’s nothing.

507
00:34:11,633 --> 00:34:12,501
Maybe they did this so that the picture will go in.

508
00:34:14,136 --> 00:34:15,404
Oh!! There is something?

509
00:34:17,473 --> 00:34:18,640
Here it is a number!

510
00:34:21,844 --> 00:34:23,178
This is Roman numerals

511
00:34:24,246 --> 00:34:26,682
2140

512
00:34:27,616 --> 00:34:28,183
Suk jing 2140?

513
00:34:28,350 --> 00:34:28,684
Oh!

514
00:34:29,752 --> 00:34:30,452
Enter it

515
00:34:32,154 --> 00:34:35,557
2140 Enter.

516
00:34:38,794 --> 00:34:39,795
It is 2140 hyung.

517
00:34:45,034 --> 00:34:45,667
You sure?

518
00:34:49,938 --> 00:34:50,372
Hey...

519
00:34:50,372 --> 00:34:51,440
It got locked now.

520
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:52,941
It got locked.

521
00:34:57,079 --> 00:35:00,849
Hyung we are first! Who found the picture first?

522
00:35:01,483 --> 00:35:02,284
Who found the picture?

523
00:35:03,652 --> 00:35:04,753
Who first found it?

524
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:05,687
What are you doing?

525
00:35:05,687 --> 00:35:08,090
Who saw it first and grabbed it?

526
00:35:10,092 --> 00:35:12,094
If you guys will be like that then I can’t cooperate with you guys.

527
00:35:12,094 --> 00:35:16,098
Leave it and go.

528
00:35:16,098 --> 00:35:18,233
Leave it-I only need ji hyo.

529
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,502
How can you say something like that?

530
00:35:24,139 --> 00:35:24,473
Oh!!

531
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:25,808
Oh!!

532
00:35:30,512 --> 00:35:31,080
A tiger.

533
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,749
It’s the same.

534
00:35:34,349 --> 00:35:35,617
It’s all the same.

535
00:35:38,821 --> 00:35:41,190
Hyung because it is here...

536
00:35:42,124 --> 00:35:45,194
-You are like an artist -I drew this in the past.

537
00:35:45,294 --> 00:35:46,628
It looks very famous.

538
00:35:46,795 --> 00:35:50,799
Yeah Because it is hanged with Leonardo Da Vinci’s drawings...

539
00:35:51,834 --> 00:35:53,735
That is like saying ‘Asia’s tiger’.

540
00:35:55,370 --> 00:35:57,339
This is a number.

541
00:35:59,108 --> 00:36:00,109
Isn’t this the number of strokes?

542
00:36:00,109 --> 00:36:00,742
32...

543
00:36:01,944 --> 00:36:03,212
6... Ey... 61.

544
00:36:09,918 --> 00:36:10,786
It’s not it right?

545
00:36:13,856 --> 00:36:15,858
Why did they do this in the below to make it confusing...

546
00:36:15,858 --> 00:36:20,762
I don’t think the one in the below is useful... Is the one in the below more useful?

547
00:36:20,963 --> 00:36:24,433
Because it is the same in the one on that picture.

548
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:27,302
Hey try to search hieroglyphics.

549
00:36:27,736 --> 00:36:28,804
Hieroglyphics?

550
00:36:30,239 --> 00:36:33,342
Really gonna make me go crazy.

551
00:36:37,246 --> 00:36:38,413
Hyung I will search here.

552
00:36:38,714 --> 00:36:40,015
What? Okay.

553
00:36:41,083 --> 00:36:43,118
Oh! What is this?

554
00:36:45,954 --> 00:36:47,489
There are sneaky people there.

555
00:36:50,959 --> 00:36:51,860
Oh! It's Yoo Jae Suk's.

556
00:36:53,262 --> 00:36:55,464
You are standing in front of my drawing.

557
00:37:01,036 --> 00:37:01,803
Hey wait!!

558
00:37:02,004 --> 00:37:02,437
Why?

559
00:37:02,604 --> 00:37:03,639
That is my drawing.

560
00:37:03,972 --> 00:37:05,040
Okay! We understand.

561
00:37:05,374 --> 00:37:07,709
-Look at it 2 steps away -My drawing must be somewhere here.

562
00:37:07,709 --> 00:37:08,644
It’s a masterpiece.

563
00:37:12,114 --> 00:37:14,082
You should indicate the QR code there.

564
00:37:14,116 --> 00:37:14,449
What?

565
00:37:15,184 --> 00:37:17,953
The QR code. Bring it near the tiger.

566
00:37:17,953 --> 00:37:18,620
Like this?

567
00:37:20,622 --> 00:37:21,223
Yeah Like that.

568
00:37:25,627 --> 00:37:27,663
This hyung is very sneaky.

569
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:39,541
What are you guys doing?

570
00:37:40,275 --> 00:37:43,478
You must look at the picture in front of it not at the back.

571
00:37:43,979 --> 00:37:45,847
What are you two doing there?

572
00:37:48,584 --> 00:37:52,688
Running man people.

573
00:37:52,688 --> 00:37:53,589
Yes.

574
00:37:53,989 --> 00:37:58,694
Running man people There is a phone call in the information desk located in 1st floor.

575
00:37:58,994 --> 00:38:00,028
A phone call.

576
00:38:02,264 --> 00:38:02,998
Dong hoon ah-Hurry.

577
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:13,342
Why?

578
00:38:13,508 --> 00:38:14,343
There is a phone call.

579
00:38:16,712 --> 00:38:17,713
Where is it located?

580
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:19,615
It was in the first floor all this time.

581
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:22,818
Oppa-You are so big.

582
00:38:24,052 --> 00:38:24,820
There is a phone call? Where?

583
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:25,554
This one?

584
00:38:29,825 --> 00:38:30,759
Hello?

585
00:38:33,328 --> 00:38:34,529
Who are you?

586
00:38:34,830 --> 00:38:38,133
I am Kim Jong kook-Running man Kim Jong Kook.

587
00:38:40,736 --> 00:38:41,203
Ouch!

588
00:38:56,018 --> 00:38:56,985
Ok, thank you.

589
00:38:59,087 --> 00:39:00,289
Yes thank you.

590
00:39:00,822 --> 00:39:02,090
Running man is speed!

591
00:39:03,358 --> 00:39:04,993
It is a big turn table.

592
00:39:05,193 --> 00:39:05,961
Let’s go.

593
00:39:10,966 --> 00:39:15,671
Basement 1st floor storage for conservation of relics.

594
00:39:18,774 --> 00:39:19,741
In the basement.

595
00:39:26,114 --> 00:39:27,616
Find what again?!

596
00:39:28,383 --> 00:39:28,750
Here it is.

597
00:39:30,919 --> 00:39:34,056
We need to confuse them.

598
00:39:36,758 --> 00:39:38,093
We must be swift.

599
00:39:38,093 --> 00:39:39,127
We must not move too obviously.

600
00:39:39,127 --> 00:39:40,529
Hyung Jae Hyung Hyung.

601
00:39:42,431 --> 00:39:42,931
Oh!

602
00:39:44,566 --> 00:39:45,834
I thought she was doing ninja moves.

603
00:39:47,135 --> 00:39:49,071
-I thought she was doing ninja moves - Where are you going?

604
00:39:49,404 --> 00:39:49,838
Yes?

605
00:39:49,971 --> 00:39:51,139
Where are you going.

606
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:52,774
Yellow You can’t do this.

607
00:39:53,308 --> 00:39:54,643
That’s it BoA! Ride together!

608
00:39:55,344 --> 00:39:58,113
Running man people-

609
00:40:26,308 --> 00:40:26,808
Oppa!

610
00:40:27,142 --> 00:40:28,744
Ji Hyo, you can't do this!

611
00:40:28,744 --> 00:40:29,878
Please give me one chance.

612
00:40:30,579 --> 00:40:32,180
-Hello -Hyung! Noona, Take away from him!

613
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:34,449
-Hello, hello? Hurry up, get it from him!

614
00:40:34,683 --> 00:40:36,051
I got it. I'm Yoo Jae Suk.

615
00:40:36,051 --> 00:40:37,853
No, it’s not! It's Lee Gwang Soo! i.

616
00:40:39,321 --> 00:40:41,089
Secretly go to the ground Relic Preservation Storage Room.

617
00:40:41,690 --> 00:40:43,959
There is something that can help decode the code.

618
00:40:46,261 --> 00:40:47,262
Okay, I got it.

619
00:40:47,729 --> 00:40:48,630
Okay, JiHyo.

620
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:51,400
Oppa, are you going to do that way?

621
00:40:56,938 --> 00:40:57,539
Ah, it’s here!

622
00:41:03,578 --> 00:41:04,713
Is it here?

623
00:41:09,017 --> 00:41:10,352
Hurry, hurry up.

624
00:41:13,889 --> 00:41:14,489
What is this?

625
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:32,874
I think we will get one each.

626
00:41:33,074 --> 00:41:33,642
Really?

627
00:41:37,179 --> 00:41:38,280
Did I turn back on the camera?

628
00:41:39,714 --> 00:41:41,349
Shall we close the door?

629
00:41:41,349 --> 00:41:42,884
-Yeah, lock it, lock it! -I will hold on to the door.

630
00:41:44,252 --> 00:41:46,488
But what will we do with these? Maybe we should find another?

631
00:41:46,822 --> 00:41:48,623
Do we have to use these for decoding?

632
00:41:51,593 --> 00:41:53,662
Hyung, just frighten every people who comes in.

633
00:41:54,262 --> 00:41:54,729
That's good.

634
00:41:55,063 --> 00:41:55,764
It’s okay

635
00:41:57,599 --> 00:41:58,400
I'll go to the CR.

636
00:42:10,278 --> 00:42:11,980
Why is this locked?

637
00:42:15,517 --> 00:42:16,151
They must have tied it up.

638
00:42:22,691 --> 00:42:24,259
Ah you guys are so mean.

639
00:42:25,393 --> 00:42:26,528
They opened it, ah.

640
00:42:26,528 --> 00:42:27,829
Oh my! I was surprised.

641
00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:30,098
Why did you* locked.

642
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:32,033
What is this?

643
00:42:32,033 --> 00:42:33,201
Why, why.

644
00:42:37,339 --> 00:42:38,373
Excuse me, you...

645
00:42:38,773 --> 00:42:40,408
Oh did I turn my back again?

646
00:42:43,612 --> 00:42:45,380
Haha I tried? everything"already.

647
00:42:47,182 --> 00:42:50,118
No, No. This is not the one....

648
00:42:56,491 --> 00:42:58,059
Hyung the numbers are all different..

649
00:43:01,129 --> 00:43:01,963
Yeah, it's all different.

650
00:43:02,130 --> 00:43:03,598
It's really different.

651
00:43:03,732 --> 00:43:05,667
Let's solve upstairs.

652
00:43:07,068 --> 00:43:08,003
Let's bring this one by one-

653
00:43:10,939 --> 00:43:11,740
Wow, you are...

654
00:43:14,843 --> 00:43:16,278
Hey, is there something inside there?

655
00:43:16,278 --> 00:43:17,712
What's in there? What did you bring?

656
00:43:17,946 --> 00:43:19,447
We’re one team.

657
00:43:19,447 --> 00:43:20,849
Oppa you are so not fair.

658
00:43:20,849 --> 00:43:22,851
Go inside.

659
00:43:24,619 --> 00:43:25,420
What is this place?

660
00:43:27,322 --> 00:43:29,291
Every material is here.

661
00:43:29,591 --> 00:43:30,292
What is this?

662
00:43:32,227 --> 00:43:33,328
This is seven....

663
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:39,200
Oh I was surprised.

664
00:43:42,704 --> 00:43:43,672
This one is too easy.

665
00:43:49,010 --> 00:43:51,513
Hyung hyung hyung hyung! It says 'Measure the temperature'

666
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:52,814
The heat, yeah..

667
00:43:52,814 --> 00:43:53,148
In here?

668
00:43:54,749 --> 00:43:56,217
This must be a number, right?

669
00:44:02,257 --> 00:44:04,359
Ha-This is so tough.

670
00:44:05,627 --> 00:44:07,062
Is every week this hard?

671
00:44:07,062 --> 00:44:07,929
Yeah...

672
00:44:11,066 --> 00:44:14,903
This shape is a scholar, and it must be something about actions.,

673
00:44:15,403 --> 00:44:17,072
And what actions could it be?

674
00:44:22,243 --> 00:44:23,912
What's this meaning? Isn't that Eight?

675
00:44:23,912 --> 00:44:24,479
Oppa,

676
00:44:24,779 --> 00:44:25,480
Number eight..

677
00:44:25,747 --> 00:44:26,948
Oppa, It's almost here.

678
00:44:28,583 --> 00:44:29,951
Where, where? Ah, it's here!

679
00:44:29,951 --> 00:44:31,720
Ei-These guys are really...!

680
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:33,822
You have no right for being team members.

681
00:44:35,423 --> 00:44:36,625
But JiHyo, these are not numbers.

682
00:44:36,625 --> 00:44:36,992
Nuna!

683
00:44:37,993 --> 00:44:38,893
Then Look for them.

684
00:44:42,330 --> 00:44:45,767
Nuna I am number Six, I solved it by looking at this mirror

685
00:44:45,934 --> 00:44:46,968
I am now number Six.

686
00:44:47,569 --> 00:44:48,470
Why don't you even listen?

687
00:44:52,774 --> 00:44:53,842
Nuna, it's number six.

688
00:44:57,679 --> 00:45:01,750
Be quiet, be still please.

689
00:45:04,019 --> 00:45:04,753
What are you doing now?

690
00:45:09,524 --> 00:45:11,159
It's nearer to number seven... or is it nine?

691
00:45:12,293 --> 00:45:14,929
Do this, and make your hips like this.

692
00:45:15,463 --> 00:45:17,198
No, like this, more to this side

693
00:45:17,832 --> 00:45:24,439
it's like number nine. Nine... Six... uh?! Seven!

694
00:45:25,573 --> 00:45:30,078
Ten! Ten! Number Ten! It's number Ten.

695
00:45:30,278 --> 00:45:31,513
This is number Ten?

696
00:45:46,528 --> 00:45:49,597
Today's mission is, Complete the Running an Code'

697
00:45:53,668 --> 00:45:54,969
Uh? There's something here...

698
00:45:56,137 --> 00:45:58,840
Two, one

699
00:46:03,478 --> 00:46:06,514
I solved it by looking at this mirror

700
00:46:13,221 --> 00:46:15,023
I got it, I got the feeling! Hyung!

701
00:46:27,902 --> 00:46:30,238
Got it, got it, got it! It's here.

702
00:46:31,139 --> 00:46:34,843
Ah'! The position changes, that's why it’s not Eleven.

703
00:46:42,684 --> 00:46:44,119
It's numbers 0912'

704
00:46:44,119 --> 00:46:45,220
Be quiet!

705
00:47:05,173 --> 00:47:06,941
Cool!! Awesome!

706
00:47:07,909 --> 00:47:09,511
I did it! I solved it!

707
00:47:10,178 --> 00:47:12,947
Hey, hey, it closed because of late opening.

708
00:47:14,849 --> 00:47:16,050
We were late!

709
00:47:16,050 --> 00:47:17,719
It's closed again!

710
00:47:19,521 --> 00:47:23,491
Who did it? Who solved... who solved the secret in the mirror?!

711
00:47:23,491 --> 00:47:24,359
Step aside, let's open it first!

712
00:47:26,361 --> 00:47:26,961
Step aside please.

713
00:47:33,568 --> 00:47:35,370
This is the one in the post office..

714
00:47:39,407 --> 00:47:43,311
Oppa, maybe it has another mission when we solve this one.

715
00:47:44,479 --> 00:47:45,547
Anyway we solved this.

716
00:47:45,547 --> 00:47:46,080
We don't need this one.

717
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:47,348
Let's go, let's go

718
00:47:47,549 --> 00:47:48,750
I said who solved the mirror?!

719
00:47:48,750 --> 00:47:49,150
You!

720
00:47:49,551 --> 00:47:50,151
Why do you shout...

721
00:47:51,319 --> 00:47:52,954
That was so great.

722
00:47:53,421 --> 00:47:54,422
Gwang Soo! Seat next to me!

723
00:47:54,422 --> 00:47:55,657
Hyung, sorry but I will seat in the front.

724
00:47:57,358 --> 00:47:59,561
Your legs... your legs are long...

725
00:47:59,561 --> 00:48:02,463
Sorry, hyung... I have something to discuss with Nuna.

726
00:48:03,698 --> 00:48:05,400
Don't try to overhear us.

727
00:48:10,638 --> 00:48:11,539
'Nandeureu village’.

728
00:48:13,041 --> 00:48:14,209
Is it written 'Nandeureu village'?

729
00:48:16,077 --> 00:48:17,679
Our Team... is finally the first!

730
00:48:19,781 --> 00:48:21,049
Why are these letters upside down?

731
00:48:25,954 --> 00:48:26,988
Let's see it upside down

732
00:48:27,956 --> 00:48:28,690
I think that's the clue

733
00:48:38,099 --> 00:48:41,069
ake it upside down and see them through the mirror!

734
00:48:44,138 --> 00:48:45,073
I think it's over there

735
00:48:50,578 --> 00:48:51,512
I think that's it, huh?

736
00:48:52,647 --> 00:48:54,382
Hyung, it's Jae Suk hyung. Jae Suk hyung!

737
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:09,464
Oh gosh!

738
00:49:10,598 --> 00:49:11,833
Wait Hyung, look at this.

739
00:49:17,839 --> 00:49:19,140
Hyung, it's a number.

740
00:49:19,140 --> 00:49:23,244
This is circle, X, and what's this... one, two.

741
00:49:32,487 --> 00:49:33,021
Okay.

742
00:49:34,489 --> 00:49:35,590
Yeah it's open.

743
00:49:47,268 --> 00:49:49,237
How did Gwang Soo solved this?

744
00:49:50,972 --> 00:49:53,741
I think this is like in the movie ’Da Vinci Code'

745
00:49:53,942 --> 00:49:55,543
I think that's the way to solve the code.

746
00:49:57,612 --> 00:49:58,212
AH!

747
00:49:58,212 --> 00:49:59,514
Isn’t this like this?

748
00:49:59,514 --> 00:49:59,948
It's this one!

749
00:50:01,249 --> 00:50:02,817
Gary, that's right.

750
00:50:03,184 --> 00:50:06,421
Take off it, wait.

751
00:50:10,892 --> 00:50:12,827
Hey this is... ah.

752
00:50:12,827 --> 00:50:14,095
Ah, it's annoying.

753
00:50:14,095 --> 00:50:16,731
Hyung, hyung! This is right!

754
00:50:18,566 --> 00:50:19,500
Gary, Stress..

755
00:50:20,168 --> 00:50:21,469
Stress.

756
00:50:22,236 --> 00:50:23,271
Da Vinci Stress!

757
00:50:23,638 --> 00:50:25,039
Ah, Stress!

758
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:34,549
Ah What's this.

759
00:50:35,817 --> 00:50:37,719
Wow this is awesome, what's this again?

760
00:50:37,719 --> 00:50:38,419
We need to...

761
00:50:39,253 --> 00:50:42,924
Just give us a bell... Can't you just give us the bell?

762
00:50:43,992 --> 00:50:44,759
Aww.

763
00:50:48,029 --> 00:50:48,963
It's not yet finished?

764
00:50:51,099 --> 00:50:53,968
I don't know why our Da Vinci lived so tough...

765
00:50:54,736 --> 00:50:56,404
That's what I'm talking about.

766
00:50:59,907 --> 00:51:00,842
Let’s fighting!

767
00:51:01,943 --> 00:51:06,347
Hyung, the one for the Da Vinci Code... How can we solve this?

768
00:51:09,283 --> 00:51:09,784
Roll it.

769
00:51:14,489 --> 00:51:16,657
These five letters becomes one word-

770
00:51:17,692 --> 00:51:20,828
Ah, today I really... I may do some great thing.

771
00:51:23,798 --> 00:51:25,433
He made it because of me.

772
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:28,669
Hyung, sorry but we will have our own discussion for a while-

773
00:51:29,937 --> 00:51:31,639
First place is not that hard

774
00:51:32,807 --> 00:51:35,109
I think I just have to think the other way with the others.

775
00:51:37,678 --> 00:51:39,113
Do you want to go back, Gwang Soo?

776
00:51:50,158 --> 00:51:50,858
We're here.

777
00:51:52,660 --> 00:51:54,128
What's this? Where's this?

778
00:51:57,432 --> 00:52:00,902
You are the first to arrive. Find the Running Man code. It's here in this village.

779
00:52:01,069 --> 00:52:03,671
In this village? Not inside here? A code..?

780
00:52:04,138 --> 00:52:05,540
Find the code?

781
00:52:09,377 --> 00:52:10,878
He said it's here in the village...

782
00:52:11,679 --> 00:52:12,413
It’s so hard.

783
00:52:13,881 --> 00:52:15,683
How can we find? This village is so big.

784
00:52:16,250 --> 00:52:17,418
Hey, this is in the Da Vinci Code'

785
00:52:17,418 --> 00:52:18,219
There's a hurdle.

786
00:52:18,219 --> 00:52:19,187
-It's in there -Ah, really?

787
00:52:19,187 --> 00:52:19,720
Yes, it shows there.

788
00:52:20,321 --> 00:52:22,457
Oppa, how was that one...

789
00:52:22,457 --> 00:52:27,161
You see this... This has five alphabets, right?

790
00:52:41,843 --> 00:52:43,511
Oppa! Look at that view It’s so amazing.

791
00:52:43,811 --> 00:52:46,214
Wow Look at this scenery It's so nice.

792
00:53:00,528 --> 00:53:01,929
Should we find in the light house?

793
00:53:02,930 --> 00:53:04,832
What's that? Why are they with a name tag?

794
00:53:15,109 --> 00:53:16,177
Maybe we have to catch them!

795
00:53:16,511 --> 00:53:18,279
Who's that?

796
00:53:18,279 --> 00:53:20,748
-Huh, why are they in name tag. -No, we have to catch them!

797
00:53:20,748 --> 00:53:21,949
They have a name tag.

798
00:53:21,949 --> 00:53:22,750
What's going on?

799
00:53:23,618 --> 00:53:24,819
There's another guest?

800
00:53:27,188 --> 00:53:28,956
Huh? What the...?

801
00:53:34,428 --> 00:53:36,297
What's that? Why are the grandmothers so fast?

802
00:53:36,797 --> 00:53:37,832
The villagers here are fast!

803
00:53:40,868 --> 00:53:44,272
Kim Ji Hye-ssi! Wait a minute!

804
00:53:47,575 --> 00:53:48,609
I took of Kim Sol Mi-ssi!

805
00:53:49,477 --> 00:53:52,079
Kim Sol Mi-ssi... There's nothing.

806
00:53:57,118 --> 00:53:57,718
Thank you very much.

807
00:53:57,752 --> 00:53:58,886
Thank you very much, good job

808
00:53:58,886 --> 00:53:59,587
Kim Sol Mi-ssi.

809
00:54:01,489 --> 00:54:02,456
It was like this...

810
00:54:02,723 --> 00:54:03,491
There's nothing here.

811
00:54:06,327 --> 00:54:07,261
Ah' we are to look for a person

812
00:54:07,261 --> 00:54:09,263
I was surprised, I thought a grandma is running that fast.

813
00:54:11,232 --> 00:54:11,999
Thank you!

814
00:54:12,099 --> 00:54:13,868
Why were you in wig??

815
00:54:16,204 --> 00:54:19,340
This... There is a real one inside the name tag. Ours were fake.

816
00:54:23,744 --> 00:54:25,213
Wow-that place is really-

817
00:54:25,613 --> 00:54:26,180
Isn't it?

818
00:54:28,583 --> 00:54:30,218
Ayoo-it's so cold...

819
00:54:31,152 --> 00:54:32,687
If you put this around your neck...

820
00:54:32,687 --> 00:54:32,987
Really?

821
00:54:32,987 --> 00:54:36,524
BoA is really tired and hungry now..

822
00:54:38,259 --> 00:54:40,761
It drives me crazzzy, really-

823
00:54:41,062 --> 00:54:42,363
drives me craazzzy.

824
00:54:42,363 --> 00:54:43,331
Makes me craazzy!

825
00:54:53,507 --> 00:54:54,809
You can't even tear that off..?

826
00:54:56,477 --> 00:54:57,878
Hey, Jae Suk!

827
00:54:57,878 --> 00:54:59,780
Why do you try to tear here?

828
00:55:00,781 --> 00:55:03,217
No..This... This... is sticked too tight.

829
00:55:05,119 --> 00:55:06,254
No no no!!

830
00:55:10,491 --> 00:55:11,359
That was close.

831
00:55:12,627 --> 00:55:14,061
Is it this way?

832
00:55:14,061 --> 00:55:15,429
Uh They're running over there!

833
00:55:15,429 --> 00:55:15,730
What is?

834
00:55:16,197 --> 00:55:16,998
It's a Staff.

835
00:55:17,431 --> 00:55:18,532
No they have a name tag!?

836
00:55:18,966 --> 00:55:20,368
They have a name tag.

837
00:55:22,403 --> 00:55:25,640
AH!!! Yeah, it’s right!

838
00:55:27,008 --> 00:55:27,608
Where are you going?

839
00:55:27,608 --> 00:55:29,443
Hey! It's at the back of the villagers.

840
00:55:29,977 --> 00:55:30,578
That's right!

841
00:55:30,578 --> 00:55:32,179
Why are they running?

842
00:55:33,748 --> 00:55:35,483
Why are they running?

843
00:55:37,118 --> 00:55:38,619
Hey, the villagers

844
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:41,222
I will surely get the name tag...

845
00:55:42,823 --> 00:55:43,557
Huh? They ran off!

846
00:55:44,091 --> 00:55:45,660
This village is so weird.

847
00:55:46,527 --> 00:55:48,029
The villagers are here.

848
00:55:48,029 --> 00:55:48,429
It's here!

849
00:55:49,163 --> 00:55:50,298
It's a grandma!

850
00:55:52,099 --> 00:55:53,968
Hey, What's with this today?

851
00:56:14,388 --> 00:56:16,791
Wait a minute, please... mother, wait...

852
00:56:20,461 --> 00:56:22,697
I think you have an important one in here, because you ran.

853
00:56:28,202 --> 00:56:30,137
You had a fun game.

854
00:56:32,039 --> 00:56:32,840
Aigo-it's so hot!

855
00:56:43,951 --> 00:56:45,019
What the, do I have to tear that off?

856
00:56:47,421 --> 00:56:48,856
There are many down there.

857
00:56:55,796 --> 00:56:56,297
Catch him!

858
00:56:58,366 --> 00:56:58,833
Catch him!

859
00:57:02,002 --> 00:57:03,003
He can never catch!

860
00:57:15,149 --> 00:57:16,016
Hyung, what are you doing?

861
00:57:16,951 --> 00:57:17,618
Let me go!

862
00:57:20,454 --> 00:57:21,288
Hyung, what are you doing?

863
00:57:21,288 --> 00:57:22,089
I am warming up

864
00:57:23,290 --> 00:57:24,458
I'm so tired.

865
00:57:25,559 --> 00:57:26,627
Did I drool?

866
00:57:32,466 --> 00:57:33,434
Hello.

867
00:57:34,602 --> 00:57:35,469
Hello.

868
00:57:36,570 --> 00:57:37,438
Excuse me.

869
00:57:42,610 --> 00:57:43,611
Aigoo-teacher.

870
00:57:49,016 --> 00:57:49,717
Thank you.

871
00:57:49,717 --> 00:57:50,918
Are you okay? Nice to meet you.

872
00:57:50,918 --> 00:57:52,019
Nice to meet you.

873
00:57:52,019 --> 00:57:58,192
Ah.. I must have come first.. Name tag was with him... Hello, nice to meet you. Hello!

874
00:58:02,530 --> 00:58:05,199
Wow, you're amazing! He's doing good!

875
00:58:07,001 --> 00:58:08,269
Don't show them, hide it.

876
00:58:12,673 --> 00:58:14,408
What the...? There's nothing!

877
00:58:18,779 --> 00:58:19,680
Wait, excuse me.

878
00:58:20,014 --> 00:58:21,782
Uh? What's this?

879
00:58:28,489 --> 00:58:28,789
Gary.

880
00:58:28,789 --> 00:58:30,157
There’s something we have it!

881
00:58:45,372 --> 00:58:46,407
Where’s BoA?

882
00:58:47,007 --> 00:58:48,242
Hyung, she's not normal, right now.

883
00:58:48,409 --> 00:58:48,943
Really?

884
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:01,388
I'm about to die right now.

885
00:59:08,329 --> 00:59:09,497
Thank you!

886
00:59:13,501 --> 00:59:15,169
Thank you so much.

887
00:59:20,207 --> 00:59:21,509
Hello there.

888
00:59:22,309 --> 00:59:22,943
No, you can’t.

889
00:59:29,550 --> 00:59:31,919
Good job! Take care.

890
00:59:35,656 --> 00:59:41,328
BoA BoA Hey guys, go on-it's so cold.

891
00:59:42,363 --> 00:59:43,597
BoA, where were you?

892
00:59:44,331 --> 00:59:45,299
I was running over...

893
00:59:46,534 --> 00:59:50,237
You really look like you played much in a village.

894
00:59:51,739 --> 00:59:52,907
There’s nothing!

895
00:59:53,807 --> 00:59:55,042
There's something inside it?

896
00:59:55,042 --> 00:59:56,010
We have one hint.

897
00:59:57,878 --> 00:59:58,612
You got one hint?

898
00:59:58,612 --> 00:59:59,446
Yeah, one...

899
00:59:59,446 --> 00:59:59,947
What?

900
00:59:59,947 --> 01:00:00,481
Letter I.

901
01:00:00,648 --> 01:00:03,918
-I ah.. it's an alphabet .. -Yeah..

902
01:00:04,985 --> 01:00:08,856
But they don't give us a name tag.

903
01:00:09,156 --> 01:00:12,393
If you do this, it's pretty fun

904
01:00:13,127 --> 01:00:22,703
other Mother! Wait a minute

905
01:00:22,703 --> 01:00:30,010
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

906
01:00:34,448 --> 01:00:36,917
Be careful.

907
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:41,855
Hold on, its not here.

908
01:00:41,855 --> 01:00:42,790
Not here.

909
01:00:42,790 --> 01:00:44,525
You seemed to be having fun.

910
01:00:45,025 --> 01:00:47,094
Thank you.

911
01:00:47,294 --> 01:00:48,495
There's none.

912
01:00:50,397 --> 01:00:51,398
Hello.

913
01:00:55,436 --> 01:00:59,340
Hello, hope you're doing ok.

914
01:01:00,941 --> 01:01:02,710
They took it off

915
01:01:04,712 --> 01:01:06,747
I'll use this for later.

916
01:01:12,886 --> 01:01:13,988
Hello.

917
01:01:23,197 --> 01:01:24,698
Good bye.

918
01:01:27,568 --> 01:01:30,237
This is my first time running this much.

919
01:01:33,574 --> 01:01:38,579
Hold on, mother.

920
01:01:38,579 --> 01:01:41,281
Hold on for a minute, let me just take the name tag.

921
01:01:43,684 --> 01:01:45,152
Why are you running, mother.

922
01:01:46,587 --> 01:01:48,088
Why are you running, mother.

923
01:01:58,232 --> 01:01:59,933
Yes!

924
01:02:05,572 --> 01:02:07,775
Thank you.

925
01:02:07,775 --> 01:02:09,576
Thank you for your hard work.

926
01:02:10,644 --> 01:02:11,945
It's an S.

927
01:02:14,048 --> 01:02:16,617
There are five letters.

928
01:02:17,117 --> 01:02:20,387
- Can you just turn around real quick can I see the name tag - Can we take a look?

929
01:02:21,055 --> 01:02:21,655
Yes.

930
01:02:22,122 --> 01:02:23,123
Thank you.

931
01:02:25,392 --> 01:02:27,494
Thank you father.

932
01:02:28,796 --> 01:02:30,731
- It's a letter! - A letter?

933
01:02:31,832 --> 01:02:32,966
It's a c?

934
01:02:34,668 --> 01:02:35,836
There's another one?

935
01:02:39,173 --> 01:02:41,608
You had this on your back.

936
01:02:41,608 --> 01:02:44,044
Than you mother.

937
01:02:45,913 --> 01:02:48,015
Father.

938
01:02:48,015 --> 01:02:51,518
What are you guys doing?

939
01:02:53,053 --> 01:02:54,688
Father, hold on.

940
01:02:55,289 --> 01:02:57,057
Thank you!

941
01:02:59,493 --> 01:03:01,729
Wow!

942
01:03:02,996 --> 01:03:06,266
Thank you father.

943
01:03:17,144 --> 01:03:20,247
We need more letters.

944
01:03:20,247 --> 01:03:21,048
We only have..

945
01:03:21,048 --> 01:03:22,916
M, C

946
01:03:22,916 --> 01:03:24,218
M, C, U?

947
01:03:24,718 --> 01:03:27,488
Hello, oh here it is! thank you.

948
01:03:27,488 --> 01:03:29,590
Oh here it is!

949
01:03:30,190 --> 01:03:31,425
Thank you.

950
01:03:36,597 --> 01:03:37,798
U

951
01:03:38,599 --> 01:03:40,100
M, C, U

952
01:03:43,570 --> 01:03:46,306
S, C, U, M

953
01:03:49,910 --> 01:03:51,879
What is there to get back to Jeju?

954
01:03:55,349 --> 01:03:59,520
If a letter is missing or there are two letters.

955
01:04:00,687 --> 01:04:05,359
M, I, C, U? No that makes no sense.

956
01:04:09,730 --> 01:04:12,299
C, U means to see someone somewhere isn't it?

957
01:04:24,511 --> 01:04:26,246
What's custom?

958
01:04:27,181 --> 01:04:28,549
No that doesn't work.

959
01:04:29,817 --> 01:04:34,087
M, U, C.. Oh its that!

960
01:04:38,559 --> 01:04:53,540
M, U, C .. isn't it music? m u s ic?

961
01:04:54,041 --> 01:04:56,977
Music fairy.

962
01:04:58,579 --> 01:05:04,418
- M, U, S, - If this is right I'm going to die.

963
01:05:30,477 --> 01:05:32,379
Oppa, you're amazing.

964
01:05:32,379 --> 01:05:35,515
There's a code in here.

965
01:05:36,283 --> 01:05:39,052
The cross means that it will become unraveled?

966
01:05:40,854 --> 01:05:44,658
If we cross then we will know the code?

967
01:05:52,466 --> 01:05:54,601
Let's go to this address first.

968
01:05:57,671 --> 01:06:01,408
If you feel the cross, then you will know the answer.

969
01:06:03,877 --> 01:06:06,647
-We need to know this -Sukjin and Gwang Soo...

970
01:06:07,381 --> 01:06:09,950
Yeah we need to know this.

971
01:06:09,950 --> 01:06:14,288
There's Yoo Jae suk in this too.

972
01:06:19,693 --> 01:06:22,296
There's Lee Gwang soo...

973
01:06:27,267 --> 01:06:28,468
We figured it out.

974
01:06:28,468 --> 01:06:29,937
Without me?

975
01:06:29,937 --> 01:06:32,072
We figured it out.

976
01:06:33,073 --> 01:06:35,709
Let's go to the car first.

977
01:06:39,346 --> 01:06:41,581
Feel, Chok, Cross!

978
01:06:44,451 --> 01:06:49,890
Today is difficult but l think we need to look at the words around it

979
01:06:49,890 --> 01:06:51,959
I don't think it's the cross.

980
01:06:52,526 --> 01:06:54,061
That's fake.

981
01:06:54,061 --> 01:07:00,100
There's a lot of those words, maybe if you reword then something will come out.

982
01:07:03,837 --> 01:07:06,073
These are name tags!

983
01:07:06,073 --> 01:07:07,808
Then suk Jin.

984
01:07:07,808 --> 01:07:09,743
Suk Jin Gwang soo name tag.

985
01:07:09,743 --> 01:07:11,945
What with music fairies?

986
01:07:21,355 --> 01:07:23,290
What about music fairies?

987
01:07:23,357 --> 01:07:29,396
This morning, they mention something about music fairies.

988
01:07:29,396 --> 01:07:30,597
That's two.

989
01:07:30,864 --> 01:07:32,366
Then we need to see their name tags.

990
01:07:33,567 --> 01:07:36,970
-We need to see inside -There's something inside their name tags.

991
01:07:36,970 --> 01:07:38,872
Let's see what's inside you name tag first.

992
01:07:38,872 --> 01:07:40,741
Then I‘m out brother.

993
01:07:40,741 --> 01:07:44,011
What are you doing, we are ace, in the same team.

994
01:07:44,011 --> 01:07:47,481
Cross! We are ace.

995
01:07:48,982 --> 01:07:50,917
This is really fun.

996
01:08:21,481 --> 01:08:23,216
Hyung, what should we do?

997
01:08:24,217 --> 01:08:26,486
What if I get one person?

998
01:08:28,422 --> 01:08:31,458
The last step.

999
01:08:32,559 --> 01:08:33,994
This must be it.

1000
01:08:34,294 --> 01:08:38,732
If you put something inside I think something comes up huh?

1001
01:08:38,732 --> 01:08:41,468
Just between it, right?

1002
01:08:44,638 --> 01:08:46,773
Yeah just between us.

1003
01:09:01,555 --> 01:09:04,091
Then we can get the other answer if we get one answer.

1004
01:09:06,593 --> 01:09:07,928
Gwang soo...

1005
01:09:16,269 --> 01:09:20,941
We have the same thought but I'm holding back.

1006
01:09:22,742 --> 01:09:24,711
Let’s hold hands.

1007
01:09:28,882 --> 01:09:32,252
-Are you trying to take the tag off? -No no.

1008
01:09:40,026 --> 01:09:42,295
They probably went that way.

1009
01:09:43,163 --> 01:09:45,432
They're over there.

1010
01:09:45,432 --> 01:09:46,333
That's them.

1011
01:09:46,333 --> 01:09:49,469
Is that them?

1012
01:09:59,613 --> 01:10:01,414
The clothes are so visible.

1013
01:10:03,783 --> 01:10:05,485
Did you figure it out?

1014
01:10:06,786 --> 01:10:08,488
Did you figure out the code?

1015
01:10:08,488 --> 01:10:10,023
No we couldn't.

1016
01:10:10,023 --> 01:10:11,124
Gwang soo!

1017
01:10:19,499 --> 01:10:22,002
-Is the code cross? -Yeah.

1018
01:10:23,436 --> 01:10:30,744
-That if the cross splits then the code is answered -Yeah,

1019
01:10:30,844 --> 01:10:32,512
So is that why you guys split up?

1020
01:10:34,581 --> 01:10:36,016
Why is he running away?

1021
01:10:40,554 --> 01:10:41,755
Did you guys meet?

1022
01:10:51,231 --> 01:10:52,766
Oh wait.

1023
01:10:53,266 --> 01:10:54,601
Let’s split up.

1024
01:10:58,104 --> 01:11:00,774
Why split up? Why?

1025
01:11:02,776 --> 01:11:04,511
He leaves Jihyo and runs away.

1026
01:11:14,955 --> 01:11:17,490
Why are you grabbing me and running?

1027
01:11:20,627 --> 01:11:22,095
-I'm not a bad person -I know.

1028
01:11:37,077 --> 01:11:38,378
That scared me.

1029
01:11:41,581 --> 01:11:42,983
Gwang Soo is here!

1030
01:11:43,883 --> 01:11:45,185
Hey; Gwang Soo's here.

1031
01:11:49,923 --> 01:11:51,491
Wait!

1032
01:11:57,297 --> 01:12:00,834
You got it, You got it, you're good.

1033
01:12:13,647 --> 01:12:14,948
How'd he get it?

1034
01:12:26,293 --> 01:12:27,894
He ripped mine off.

1035
01:12:28,928 --> 01:12:30,997
There's nothing there.

1036
01:12:47,814 --> 01:12:48,915
Suk Jin

1037
01:12:49,349 --> 01:12:51,851
Lee Gwang soo.

1038
01:12:51,851 --> 01:12:55,088
Suk Jin Gwang soo, name tag.

1039
01:12:56,523 --> 01:13:01,261
There's something on Jae hyung’s name tag.

1040
01:13:01,261 --> 01:13:02,228
Really?

1041
01:13:12,605 --> 01:13:15,608
Are you thinking it's me? Wait hold on.

1042
01:13:15,608 --> 01:13:21,247
Think about it. Wait, hold on a minute.

1043
01:13:38,198 --> 01:13:39,466
It’s Jihyo. It's on Jihyo.

1044
01:13:39,466 --> 01:13:41,534
It's not on Gwang soo?

1045
01:13:41,534 --> 01:13:42,635
It's not on Gwang Soo.

1046
01:14:00,687 --> 01:14:01,888
This?

1047
01:14:11,364 --> 01:14:12,899
Did you see something on the name tag.

1048
01:14:12,899 --> 01:14:14,734
-What / -This.

1049
01:14:16,403 --> 01:14:17,904
Where is it.

1050
01:14:19,639 --> 01:14:25,345
-I have it but you can't take my name tag off -Ok I won't

1051
01:14:25,345 --> 01:14:27,280
I'm telling you I won't.

1052
01:14:30,850 --> 01:14:31,985
This.

1053
01:14:34,454 --> 01:14:35,989
Ok?

1054
01:14:35,989 --> 01:14:37,090
H?

1055
01:14:38,725 --> 01:14:45,131
You have to one of the coins in there. The other one's with BoA.

1056
01:14:45,765 --> 01:14:55,608
Because the cross, so the cross is split up. I erased it and the fairy name tags came up.

1057
01:15:08,721 --> 01:15:12,091
-But those are Jae hyung and BoA -Exactly.

1058
01:15:12,091 --> 01:15:14,594
So you have to find BoA.

1059
01:15:15,462 --> 01:15:19,966
But we find BoA and take the tag off then what's the secret?

1060
01:15:19,966 --> 01:15:21,868
We need to put the key back over there.

1061
01:15:21,868 --> 01:15:24,671
Then the result is..

1062
01:15:38,818 --> 01:15:44,858
If we win the prize, I'll give a third to you.

1063
01:15:45,825 --> 01:15:47,494
Let's just find it first.

1064
01:15:47,594 --> 01:15:48,795
-Yes -Yes.

1065
01:15:50,396 --> 01:15:51,397
Let's go.

1066
01:15:57,036 --> 01:16:00,573
-Why? Wow you’re too much -I thought you weren’t going to do that.

1067
01:16:00,607 --> 01:16:04,477
-You're too curious -Let's hold hands and go.

1068
01:16:04,677 --> 01:16:07,914
-You're too curious -Let's hold hands and go.

1069
01:16:08,414 --> 01:16:10,783
Let's hold hands and go..

1070
01:16:13,286 --> 01:16:15,889
I can't live because of this.

1071
01:16:18,291 --> 01:16:20,560
They look like zombies.

1072
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:22,562
It's not like that.

1073
01:16:22,562 --> 01:16:24,397
Let’s hold hands.

1074
01:16:30,069 --> 01:16:34,474
No no lets hold hands and go.

1075
01:16:34,474 --> 01:16:36,075
Lets go, for real.

1076
01:16:43,816 --> 01:16:46,085
Is the camp fire strong?

1077
01:16:46,853 --> 01:16:48,454
Why are you guys together?

1078
01:16:49,923 --> 01:16:52,625
Jae Suk, be careful of your back.

1079
01:16:53,059 --> 01:16:54,694
-Why? -Be careful.

1080
01:16:54,694 --> 01:16:56,696
What?

1081
01:16:57,897 --> 01:17:00,066
We'll be back where the last step is.

1082
01:17:00,366 --> 01:17:02,068
Can you not go?

1083
01:17:03,570 --> 01:17:06,472
I don't understand, be careful of what?

1084
01:17:07,006 --> 01:17:09,842
-If we run, do we win? -Brother should we run for a change?

1085
01:17:11,077 --> 01:17:13,379
Should we all run

1086
01:17:13,746 --> 01:17:17,951
I feel like we can win easily.

1087
01:17:18,017 --> 01:17:19,085
Then.

1088
01:17:19,118 --> 01:17:21,354
Should we take mine off and see?

1089
01:17:21,354 --> 01:17:24,791
Wait no hold on.

1090
01:17:24,857 --> 01:17:25,959
Then.

1091
01:17:26,793 --> 01:17:33,566
-Then you take mine -Then we can take each other's off

1092
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:36,235
we have to because one of us can be a spy.

1093
01:17:36,235 --> 01:17:38,638
Yeah take it off

1094
01:17:38,638 --> 01:17:41,941
1,2,3 rock paper scissors.

1095
01:17:43,943 --> 01:17:45,278
This is so annoying.

1096
01:17:48,147 --> 01:17:50,316
-Theres nothing here.

1097
01:17:50,316 --> 01:17:51,784
-Nothing?-Yes.

1098
01:17:52,118 --> 01:17:53,286
Then put it back on.

1099
01:17:55,088 --> 01:17:58,191
This can happen.

1100
01:17:58,391 --> 01:18:01,527
Wait no hold on.

1101
01:18:03,429 --> 01:18:07,333
Hey this is annoying so I don’t know.

1102
01:18:07,333 --> 01:18:10,336
-Then I have to take mine off -No no.

1103
01:18:12,138 --> 01:18:15,375
No no you can't BoA.

1104
01:18:16,109 --> 01:18:17,744
No let me.

1105
01:18:17,744 --> 01:18:19,612
No you can't, don't let her do it.

1106
01:18:19,912 --> 01:18:22,515
What is going on. What should we do?

1107
01:18:22,815 --> 01:18:24,651
What is going on here?

1108
01:18:27,453 --> 01:18:28,988
You and Gary both did rock paper scissors huh?

1109
01:18:29,288 --> 01:18:31,524
The most important person.

1110
01:18:31,524 --> 01:18:33,726
What are you going to do?

1111
01:18:33,726 --> 01:18:35,561
Why are you here?

1112
01:18:35,595 --> 01:18:37,330
Why are you guys just roaming around?

1113
01:18:37,330 --> 01:18:38,564
We'll be back.

1114
01:18:38,564 --> 01:18:40,166
Ok go go.

1115
01:18:40,667 --> 01:18:43,069
If you win, we all win right.

1116
01:18:50,376 --> 01:18:53,312
Did BoA take off her tag?

1117
01:18:53,579 --> 01:18:55,615
I'm not sure.

1118
01:18:56,816 --> 01:18:58,017
We'll be back.

1119
01:19:00,119 --> 01:19:01,187
What are you doing?

1120
01:19:02,955 --> 01:19:04,257
What are you doing?

1121
01:19:04,557 --> 01:19:05,692
What is this.

1122
01:19:06,125 --> 01:19:09,328
- There's none! - Eyyy, that is not right!

1123
01:19:09,328 --> 01:19:12,665
Eeyyy, hey! Hey!

1124
01:19:12,665 --> 01:19:14,767
Wow this is a little too much.

1125
01:19:14,767 --> 01:19:17,103
Jihyo, this is the type of person he is!

1126
01:19:17,103 --> 01:19:18,905
-Woaah! -Aish, seriously!

1127
01:19:21,340 --> 01:19:22,341
I lost for no reason.

1128
01:19:23,176 --> 01:19:25,178
Do you guys trust each other?

1129
01:19:37,090 --> 01:19:38,391
Stay there.

1130
01:19:54,373 --> 01:19:56,576
Wait a minute. Oh Hyung!

1131
01:20:11,968 --> 01:20:13,904
Wait a minute. Oh Hyung!

1132
01:20:21,334 --> 01:20:24,270
You didn't do that, here!

1133
01:20:24,337 --> 01:20:27,440
I didn't do that, I didn't do that! Hold on.

1134
01:20:27,540 --> 01:20:29,675
Ah... seriously.

1135
01:20:53,266 --> 01:20:55,434
This is so pathetic.

1136
01:20:55,935 --> 01:20:56,936
What's this?

1137
01:21:01,541 --> 01:21:02,742
-There's something? -Yeah.

1138
01:21:05,136 --> 01:21:07,210
Put both the coins in.

1139
01:21:24,730 --> 01:21:27,633
-It's coming up -What is it?

1140
01:21:27,633 --> 01:21:29,202
Should I open it?

1141
01:21:30,670 --> 01:21:32,104
What is it?

1142
01:21:32,605 --> 01:21:34,040
What is it?

1143
01:21:34,473 --> 01:21:36,042
-It's a cord.. -huh?

1144
01:21:41,514 --> 01:21:44,450
Today's mission you need to find a running man code.

1145
01:21:44,450 --> 01:21:45,985
Code?

1146
01:21:50,957 --> 01:21:53,226
This is the code.

1147
01:21:53,626 --> 01:21:56,295
This is music, music.

1148
01:21:56,295 --> 01:21:59,065
The music fairies.

1149
01:21:59,065 --> 01:22:01,334
Running man code.

1150
01:22:06,272 --> 01:22:07,273
Code?

1151
01:22:07,974 --> 01:22:08,841
Cord!

1152
01:22:23,990 --> 01:22:29,395
Number one!

1153
01:22:37,103 --> 01:22:38,504

1154
01:22:39,171 --> 01:22:41,274
-Seafood -Thank you.

-Lobster, lobster! Abalone and -This is so good

1156
01:22:51,584 --> 01:22:53,719
I eat this every morning so.,

1157
01:22:54,854 --> 01:22:56,756
oh gosh I'm going to just!

1158
01:22:56,889 --> 01:22:59,425
Wait... What?

1159
01:23:04,230 --> 01:23:05,965
This is something you do during camping.

1160
01:23:07,633 --> 01:23:10,870
There's meat in there too

1161
01:23:10,870 --> 01:23:13,339
I said "for tomorrow do something good".

1162
01:23:13,940 --> 01:23:17,510
Acting like he prepared this.

1163
01:23:19,512 --> 01:23:21,714
This is so good, Hyung!

1164
01:23:21,714 --> 01:23:23,816
Do the guest usually do this?

1165
01:23:35,394 --> 01:23:36,929
Where are we going?

1166
01:23:39,465 --> 01:23:40,933
Alice in wonderland.

1167
01:23:47,106 --> 01:23:49,575
Open this door and go back home
