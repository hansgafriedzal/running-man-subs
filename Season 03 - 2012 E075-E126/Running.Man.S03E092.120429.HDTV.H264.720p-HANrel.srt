3
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:16,350
I wanted to start the day
today without clapping.

4
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:22,970
Let's go with the atmosphere if you can.
It's been 2 years now.

5
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:26,330
It sounds like you're talking to me.

6
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:30,110
Seriously...
it's shooting me straight in the heart.

7
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:35,360
-No, I didn't mean...
-Thank you...thank you.

8
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,480
Do you know what he just said right now?

9
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:39,610
- Hello! (in Chinese)
- Ah, yes...

10
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:45,410
-Come on, Suk Jin...
-Why? Hyung's drinking first. (Older brother)

11
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:47,490
Seriously...I can't even drink my tea?

12
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:52,300
-What? I'm asking if I can't even drink tea?
-Wow...you seem very cool right now.

13
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:55,280
It's not just for today anymore,
but I'm going to be like this all the time.

14
00:00:56,410 --> 00:00:59,280
You're all dead now...
Let's get up to the roof.

15
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:02,190
-You're sounding real tough right now.
-You're a tough guy.

16
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:06,870
Get your hair done like how Kim Moo Soo
used to do in the past.

17
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:08,860
So that it holds up nice outside too.

18
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,110
Kwang Soo.
Did you see the broadcast yesterday?

19
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:13,580
-Yes, I saw it.
-Seriously...

20
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:20,440
Because I was teamed up with you...
I wasn't on the screen very much.

21
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:22,880
How is that my fault?!

22
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:25,540
You know I did my best!

23
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:28,060
Since he's not on the screen much,
you can just give him to me.

24
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:30,260
You're really territorial over
Kwang Soo lately.

25
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:32,220
I have some uses for him lately.

26
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:35,370
-See? That means I'm doing well.
-After that...

27
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:39,350
You have to get my permission first.
He's mine.

28
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:42,820
-What's wrong?  What's wrong?
-Hey, hey, hey!

29
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:53,010
-What are you doing?
-Because she's like family...

30
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:56,150
-What are you doing right now?
-How am I your family?

31
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:59,050
Ji Hyo...sorry, Ji Hyo.

32
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:02,210
Then...why are we dressed like this today?

33
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:06,030
Don't you think we're going
to have a guest today? Guest of sorts?

34
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:08,300
I wonder if it's a guest that's
related to China somehow?

35
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:09,970
We are in Chinatown.

36
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:11,670
Who's coming out today?

37
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:16,490
<i>Our guest for the day is already here,
and is waiting.</i>

38
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:17,680
-Oh really?
-Why?

39
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,300
<i>If you look off to your side,
you're going to see some screen doors.</i>

40
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:25,800
<i>You each pick a door and stand
in front of the screen to select the guest.</i>

41
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,520
-Hyung...forget it.
-Why?

42
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,250
Couple of weeks ago, we had Lee Deok Hwa,
and the other two guys as guests.

43
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:33,300
-Last week, it was just us.
-We didn't have any last week.

44
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,900
This time, it's the Idols' turn.

45
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:40,140
Unconditionally! I swear to it!

46
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:45,190
<i>Once I say go, you have to stand in front
of the door that you choose.</i>

47
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:46,310
I'll take my time going.

48
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,550
I was comfortable with the hyungnims.
(His older mentors)

49
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,720
-Why is that?
-The reason why is...

50
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,470
-Even though those guys were nice...now...
-Suzy, isn't it time for you to be on the show?

51
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:01,460
Suzy...or Sistar's Bora.

52
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:03,820
Hey, I'll use Kwang Soo today.

53
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:09,330
-Guest...come on out!
-Jessica!

54
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:14,020

-Please!

(FD = assistant producer)

56
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:30,090
-There you go!
-I knew this was going to happen.

57
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:33,340
[Disappointed]

58
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:37,260
I knew it was going to be like this...
seriously.

59
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:39,770
-We are!
-It's going to be us, no doubt...

60
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:44,170
Seeing how Gary and I
are together like this today...

61
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:47,150
Today, we're going to get a beautiful guest.

62
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:48,760
Who shall we call out?

63
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,960
-Beauty.
-Beauty.

64
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:54,630
-Should we try calling out for Suzy Q?
-Sure, Suzy Q sounds nice.

65
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:58,560
Believing that Suzy Q will come out,
we'll call out for Suzy's name.

66
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,790
-1, 2, 3...
-Suzy Q!

67
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,290
[Man with the boyish smile,
Actor Chun Jung Myung!]

68
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:24,140
[Surprised!]

69
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:25,440
I was surprised because he's good looking.

70
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:31,160
Seriously...this isn't right,
but he is so pretty for a man!

71
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,080
He's so pretty for a man!

72
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,390
-Hello...
-I was so surprised.

[Yoo Hyuk - Gary - Jung Myung: one team]

74

-It's Jung Myung?
-Total A class.

75
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:45,130
Jung Myung is a very close dongsaeng.
(Younger brother/friend0

76
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:48,010
He's my dongsaeng from my neighborhood.
[Showing off his friendship]

77
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:49,380
The two of you look really ugly standing
next to him right now!

78
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:52,560
We're in big trouble today!

79

<i>Hurry up and call out for Suzy.</i>

80
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,010
<i>Should I pretend to be a girl?</i>

81
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:04,320
<i>You don't have any girl costumes?</i>

82

83

We're going to see what we have over here.

J.Y.P...J.Y.P!

88
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,920
-Seriously? J.Y.P?
-With a live broadcast coming up...

89
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,440
What are you going to do about your broadcast
for you to come out on this?

90
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:50,160
With Kwang Soo there...I think you're going
to be very disappointed with those 2...

91
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,800
-We are...
-We're the best!

92
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:57,050
Since earlier, you thought it was a girl,
and then it turned out not to be,

93
00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:00,340
and with the second one, you said it's okay
even though it's a man because he's handsome,

94
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:02,910
but since I'm neither, I got so nervous!

95
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:06,600
When I first opened the door,
he smiled and said "I'm sorry".

96
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:13,860
Then have the teams been decided?
Jung Myung, Gary and myself like this?

97
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:16,070
-That's how it is right now.
-I guess it's 3 per team?

98
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:18,710
Today's broadcast of K-Pop star
is their last show.

99

-We will...
-It will be revealed after a moment!

if you've been on the show for 2 years.

101
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:29,110
Did the two of you shoot
a movie together recently?

102
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:32,340
No, no...Jin Young is going to be
making a comeback soon...

103
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:34,720
Jin Young, let us hear something.

104
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,410
-Shall we?
-Why don't you sing something for us?

105
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:40,880
[A taste of JYP's new song, 'Only You']

106
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:47,220
What's wrong with me today?

107
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:50,520
-I was a little too nervous...
-It's okay!

108
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:54,170
It should have been half oxygen
and half voice.

109
00:06:54,360 --> 00:07:00,170
Since all you did was sing without oxygen,
of course, your voice was going to crack.

110
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:02,760
JYP!  JYP!

111
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:05,920
From the beginning, the breathing that
flows in and out,

112
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:09,330
half oxygen, and half voice
that I stressed about more than anything...

113
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:12,140
Half oxygen and half voice...

114
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:14,750
What's wrong with me today?

115
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:18,920
JYP...instead of judging what others do,

116
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:21,680
you yourself should have used
half oxygen and half voice...

117
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:25,260
The oxygen...with the voice...

118
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:28,560
It's because there was
no oxygen within your voice...in your voice.

119
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:31,060
If you work that way,
it's not getting much of anything.

120
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,410
This is what I mean...when you're nervous,
the oxygen is depleted from your voice.

121
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:41,800
Human...JYP.
Even JYP is human!

122
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:44,550
-I can see it now...
-You can tell how much oxygen is needed now?

123
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:47,050
It's because there was no oxygen,
even JYP ended up like that.

124
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:49,650
For too long of a time...
all we've done was talk about him.

125
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:52,560
You're right, you're right.

126
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:57,770
-Chun Jung Myung! Chun Jung Myung!
-He's got cold feet...

127
00:07:57,770 --> 00:07:59,500
-Don't do that.
-Why?

128
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:02,780
Back in the day, when Jung Myung and I
used to do "X-Man" together,

129
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:04,800
his nickname was Mr. Freeze.

130
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,280
He has some stiffness about him.

131
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:11,000
Earlier too,
when the filming was stopped for awhile,

132
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,040
and we kept telling him not to worry
because we were joking around,

133
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:18,900
he said 'I know...
it should've been a girl group that came out'.

134
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,090
It really isn't like that...
Seriously!  We're excited about you here!

135
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:26,720
-You have no idea how happy we are.
-You need to pay more attention to him.

136
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,190
Why are you still talking about that
when that nickname was from years ago?

137
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:31,390
How many years ago was that?

138
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:33,920
-2004.
-2004. You remembered.

139

[Remembered exactly...
Nicknames are not to be forgotten!]

140
00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:45,200
So...since we're teamed up with Jung Myung,
are we starting off right away or not?

141
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,700
<i>I will reveal your mission for the day.</i>

142
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:50,830

<i>And to the winner...
the prize is golden chopsticks.</i>

147
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:14,630
<i>Just look at these black bean noodles.</i>

148
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:17,070
Jae Suk really likes noodles.

149
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:20,010
Jae Suk, when you're eating noodles,
you really look ugly.

150
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:25,140
Even though I do know
that I'm not good looking...

151
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:29,170
[So...? Next week - viewers' picks will
be revealed!]

152

We just need the plastic bowls!

665
00:41:45,490 --> 00:41:51,270
Jung Myung is going around in circles.

666
00:41:53,050 --> 00:41:55,800
-What the heck is this?
-22 seconds.

667
00:41:57,830 --> 00:41:59,460
One more.  Just one more!

668
00:42:00,990 --> 00:42:02,410
Where do you think?

669
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:05,590
<i>50 seconds.</i>

670
00:42:10,090 --> 00:42:13,710
-What the heck is this?
-His face!  It's out of the water!!

671
00:42:13,710 --> 00:42:16,660
No!  That's not right!
His face came out of the water.

672
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:21,300
-His mouth came out of the water.
-You can't use this.

673
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:23,200
This makes no sense.

674
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:30,760
-Come on Jung Myung...seriously...
-This isn't right.

675
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:38,740
-This...wow...his mouth was out of the water.
-No, no...you pulled me out.

676
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:40,400
So I had no choice in getting pulled.

677
00:42:40,410 --> 00:42:44,460
Let me make a request...
don't interrupt this time.

678
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:46,410
We're not going to do it.

679
00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:49,680
-Go in there slowly.
-You can live under the water, Jong Kook.

680
00:42:51,650 --> 00:42:53,430
Doll and plastic bowl.

681
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:00,010
Get in there, Jong Kook!

682
00:43:01,590 --> 00:43:05,740
Where do you think you're going?
You can't go in there!

683
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:10,070
Come out of there. You can't...
there's nothing in there.

684
00:43:11,090 --> 00:43:14,100
-Come on...
-I said, go away!

685
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:27,640
[Ji Hyo and Ha Ha have found one pair of dolls]

686
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:29,090
Come up here, Ji Hyo.

687
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:32,420
Run, run.

688
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:37,140
Ha Ha!  Over there!

689
00:43:43,110 --> 00:43:46,350
-Hey!
-We got it!  We got all of them!

690
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:53,740
-Go away!
-Don't do it!

691
00:43:58,530 --> 00:44:03,050
-Got it!  We did it!
-It's over!

692
00:44:10,660 --> 00:44:13,250
Why are you acting like you're in a movie?

693
00:44:15,470 --> 00:44:19,040
We thought about how you could come out
looking cool, didn't you?

694
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:21,080
I really thought I was going to die.
I'm not kidding!

695
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:22,810
You saw how I helped, right?

696
00:44:23,650 --> 00:44:26,730
You're lying on my foot.  It hurts!

697
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:31,920
You were lying on her foot.
Just look at her foot!

698
00:44:33,260 --> 00:44:34,890
We did it.

699
00:44:34,890 --> 00:44:36,820
You succeeded within a minute.

700
00:44:37,170 --> 00:44:39,610
-Awesome.
-You two really are the best.

701
00:44:39,990 --> 00:44:43,340
As before, the sweet pickled radish
is one of these three dishes.

702
00:44:43,730 --> 00:44:45,650
You have to carefully pick one.

703
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:48,540
1, 2, 3.

704
00:44:50,660 --> 00:44:51,660
Open it.

705
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:02,950
If you go to a black bean noodle shop,
you usually get a sticker, right?

706
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:04,040
Yes, a coupon.

707
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:05,300
It's a coupon sticker.

708
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:09,770
If you don't collect 3 coupon stickers,
the customer isn't going to pay you.

709
00:45:10,150 --> 00:45:12,280
So we're going to have to fight
no matter what, right?

710
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:14,310
Inside the car...

711
00:45:14,310 --> 00:45:21,050
You have to put it on the back of
one of you inside the car.

712
00:45:23,380 --> 00:45:26,090
Should we just put it on you since
anyone would be expecting that?

713
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:27,700
Make it obvious?

714
00:45:27,980 --> 00:45:31,680
Or...you want to stick it on me,
and I can hide?

715
00:45:31,690 --> 00:45:34,620
No matter, I think it would be best
to stick it on you.

716
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:37,500
But you fight better than me.

717
00:45:42,830 --> 00:45:45,080
-It's been a minute and 30 seconds...
-Just a little bit longer.  Here it is!

718
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:47,040
Here it is!  we found it!

719
00:45:47,050 --> 00:45:49,670
-We found it, we found it.
-Where's the other one?

720
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:53,390
A little bit longer! We found it!

721
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:57,320
-We found it!
-We found it!

722
00:45:58,220 --> 00:46:01,990
-JYP!  We found it!
-Success!

723
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:13,620
Pil-Chok-Speed-Cross!

724
00:46:13,630 --> 00:46:16,140
Speed-Cross!!

725
00:46:16,490 --> 00:46:18,280
Look at what they're making the one
who's out of breath do.

726
00:46:20,910 --> 00:46:24,370
-JYP...nice job.
-JYP.

727
00:46:24,370 --> 00:46:27,700
Now the choosing...you do it, Kwang Soo.

728
00:46:27,700 --> 00:46:31,150
Why not pick the middle on again?
We shouldn't change now.

729
00:46:38,010 --> 00:46:39,530
[Yellow confetti!]

730
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:45,960
My eyes must be getting bad.
I thought it was the real thing.

731
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:52,850
While you're driving in the car,
put it on one of your backs.

732
00:46:52,850 --> 00:46:54,130
I think only 1 person is going to
put it on their backs.

733
00:46:56,070 --> 00:46:59,760
-What do you think we should do?
-If you put it on my back,

734
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:02,380
-I'm confident I won't have it ripped off.
-Really?

735
00:47:02,380 --> 00:47:05,020
-You're strong.
-What do you think?

736
00:47:05,020 --> 00:47:09,390
-He's name is Him Jin Young. (Strength)
-No matter what, put it on JYP's back.

737
00:47:09,390 --> 00:47:11,430
I played American Football in school.

738
00:47:12,590 --> 00:47:14,370
-Oh my God!
-JYP!

739
00:47:14,370 --> 00:47:16,790
I played the running back.

740
00:47:16,790 --> 00:47:21,170
Running back is running around with the ball
making sure it doesn't get taken away.

741
00:47:29,660 --> 00:47:31,370
Sunglasses, and plastic bowl!

742
00:47:32,770 --> 00:47:35,290
The easy one first.  Number 11!

743
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:37,250
Where was the plastic bowl?

744
00:47:41,110 --> 00:47:43,320
Plastic bowl...plastic bowl was here.

745
00:47:45,180 --> 00:47:46,510
What the heck is this?

746
00:47:47,830 --> 00:47:49,010
Over there then.

747
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:52,120
Over there.  That way.

748
00:47:59,290 --> 00:48:01,140
Was it on the other side?

749
00:48:09,670 --> 00:48:10,910
Here's one.

750
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:17,950
There it is.

751
00:48:20,090 --> 00:48:23,070
Jung Myung!  We got them all!
We got them all!

752
00:48:41,860 --> 00:48:43,890
<i>Jung Myung...!</i>

753
00:48:50,390 --> 00:48:53,590
-Jung Myung!
-Jung Myung!

754
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:59,320
You should've said something on your way!

755
00:49:00,150 --> 00:49:03,470
-When you were almost here...
-Jung Myung!

756
00:49:04,380 --> 00:49:05,960
Jung Myung!

757
00:49:07,490 --> 00:49:11,230
Jung Myung!
We told you we were almost there.

758
00:49:11,230 --> 00:49:12,830
Why now of all time?

759
00:49:12,830 --> 00:49:15,190
You should've said you were right here.

760
00:49:15,190 --> 00:49:16,970
I thought you were way back there.

761
00:49:17,270 --> 00:49:19,590
We were almost there like in the movies...

762
00:49:20,180 --> 00:49:21,820
Let's do it again.  Again.

763
00:49:23,620 --> 00:49:26,640
-Just give us the credit now.
-Give us the credit now?

764
00:49:28,310 --> 00:49:30,690
Did I...save this one?

765
00:49:34,770 --> 00:49:41,090
Yeah, you did save one.
You saved a jewel-like one.

766
00:49:41,090 --> 00:49:42,890
But we should get going too now.

767
00:49:42,890 --> 00:49:46,160
Even though it would be nice to save it here,
we have to get going too.

768
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:48,560
Doll and basket.

769
00:49:52,380 --> 00:49:54,130
It's so hard to hold my breath...

770
00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:06,860
Basket is in number 13.

771
00:50:19,450 --> 00:50:20,610
This is too hard!

772
00:50:21,690 --> 00:50:23,800
-Jung Myung!
-Endure it!

773
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:40,380
-It's in the back.
-The back?

774
00:50:48,540 --> 00:50:51,550
Jung Myung!  We're almost there!

775
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:13,900
I think I got 50 seconds...

776
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:15,820
I only got 50 seconds.

777
00:51:19,290 --> 00:51:21,220
I'm really sorry.

778
00:51:21,220 --> 00:51:22,980
All we had to do was get back.

779
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:25,950
All we had to do was bring those back.

780
00:51:26,290 --> 00:51:28,750
I endured 10 more seconds than the last time.

781
00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:32,390
-This is something...
-I could've endured longer, but it was funny.

782
00:51:33,330 --> 00:51:35,050
What was so funny?

783
00:51:35,750 --> 00:51:37,980
I just imagined you guys running back.

784
00:51:42,060 --> 00:51:43,580
You guys running back like this.

785
00:51:44,580 --> 00:51:46,470
You laughed while imagining that?

786

Fighting, fighting.

788

I think you've forgotten that, Jung Myung.
We were the very first to arrive here.

789
00:51:56,440 --> 00:51:57,620
I understand.

790
00:51:57,630 --> 00:52:01,160
-We will...
-Doll and plastic bowl.

791
00:52:05,470 --> 00:52:09,040
Which one first?
The closer ones or the further ones?

792
00:52:09,740 --> 00:52:11,730
[Jung Myung just can't dunk his head in.]

793
00:52:11,730 --> 00:52:13,350
You have to dunk your head in.

794
00:52:14,770 --> 00:52:16,030
Hurry up and grab it.

795
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:19,290

00:52:19,290 --> 00:52:21,240

-Plastic bowl.

-Plastic bowl.
-One more.

800
00:52:33,610 --> 00:52:36,720
-Where is the plastic bowl?
-In the third one!

801
00:52:36,750 --> 00:52:38,860

We'll put it up there, but if Jae Suk comes,

834
00:55:41,950 --> 00:55:45,410
If he asks for it,
I'll tell him 'I don't know'...

835
00:55:45,410 --> 00:55:47,000
Of course!

-Your senses are amazing!

-I have no idea what you're talking about.

Yes, they could.

that we're on.

-What are you guys doing over there?!

They're on the either side.

-That was something.

If we were to go one on one,
who would we have a better chance against?

912

We have to think this carefully.

913
01:01:17,690 --> 01:01:21,740
I think we should team up with the red team,
and get rid of Jong Kook.

914
01:01:21,740 --> 01:01:24,900
If we were to get rid of Jong Kook,
then it would help us greatly.

You know how Jong Kook thinks
we're working together with him right now?

916

Then this is the chance to tear
the tag off his back right now.

917

This is the only chance we have.

918

01:08:52,840 --> 01:08:56,530
-Gary!  Gary!
-No!  You can't!

1000
01:08:56,530 --> 01:09:00,610
-You can't!
-Jung Myung!  Jung Myung!

1001
01:09:05,150 --> 01:09:07,730
-You can't!  You can't!
-Get him!

1002
01:09:14,570 --> 01:09:17,150
-There's Jung Myung!
-You're both out?

1003
01:09:18,010 --> 01:09:21,110
Because Jung Myung wasn't here,
things went well like this.

1004
01:09:23,120 --> 01:09:24,460
We totally failed.

1005
01:09:25,200 --> 01:09:28,890
Jung Myung...you have no choice
but to team up with us now.

1006
01:09:28,890 --> 01:09:30,610
Should I?  Want to do it together?

1007
01:09:33,800 --> 01:09:36,090
-You guys are switching too easily.
-3 against 3.

1008
01:09:36,760 --> 01:09:39,450
He says it's 3 against 3.
When we have a girl here.

1009
01:09:39,450 --> 01:09:42,920
-This is really...
-But we're not sneaky about it.

1010
01:09:48,470 --> 01:09:49,400
Come here, Kwang Soo.

1011
01:09:49,400 --> 01:09:52,310
The most important thing is,
get rid of Jong Kook first.

1012
01:09:52,830 --> 01:09:54,780
So you have to block the other 2.

1013
01:09:55,470 --> 01:09:59,550
If you block Ha Ha, and Ji Hyo,

1014
01:09:59,550 --> 01:10:03,190
as long as you can block them,
I think we could get Jong Kook.

1015
01:10:03,190 --> 01:10:07,320
This meeting...let's call this an Ace meeting.

1016
01:10:07,320 --> 01:10:10,930
A-C-E-Cross!

1017
01:10:15,270 --> 01:10:16,970
Jung Myung's coming.  Jung Myung's coming.

1018
01:10:28,710 --> 01:10:30,450
<i>JYP!  Fighting!</i>

1019
01:10:30,450 --> 01:10:34,130
Wow...this is really hard.
There are 3 guys over there...

1020
01:10:34,130 --> 01:10:37,550
With 3 guys there...

1021
01:10:40,620 --> 01:10:43,640
Hyungnim!  Let's not be that way!

1022
01:10:45,290 --> 01:10:46,700
Kwang Soo!

1023
01:10:47,880 --> 01:10:50,860
Where did Kwang Soo go?

1024
01:10:50,860 --> 01:10:52,890
You have to be careful of Kwang Soo.

1025
01:10:53,360 --> 01:10:55,270
["Where did he go...?!"]

1026
01:10:55,430 --> 01:10:57,640
JYP!  JYP!

1027
01:11:00,410 --> 01:11:02,800
Ji Hyo!  Ji Hyo!

1028
01:11:22,530 --> 01:11:24,170
How do we do this?

1029
01:11:26,570 --> 01:11:30,950
Wait...wait a minute...
Come on...wait.

1030
01:11:32,550 --> 01:11:33,900
Kwang Soo!

1031
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:41,310
What are you doing?  What are you doing?

1032
01:11:41,310 --> 01:11:44,030
Come here Kwang Soo.  Come here.

1033
01:11:50,550 --> 01:11:52,980
No, Kwang Soo!
Don't do it!

1034
01:12:01,020 --> 01:12:01,940
[They combined forces to get the strongest
one out, but it wasn't enough...]

1035
01:12:01,940 --> 01:12:03,260
Kwang Soo!

1036
01:12:08,090 --> 01:12:11,360
-Kwang Soo!  Kwang Soo!
-Awesome.  Awesome!

1037
01:12:11,370 --> 01:12:13,610
You have to be careful of the giraffe!
Watch out for the giraffe!

1038
01:12:17,650 --> 01:12:18,820
Where did he go?

1039
01:12:21,680 --> 01:12:23,740
Kwang Soo's not someone
who can just sit still.

1040
01:12:24,650 --> 01:12:28,910
Kwang Soo.  Rip Jung Myung's name off.
That is your job.

1041
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:33,340
Hey, what are you doing?
Are you playing with me?

1042
01:12:58,650 --> 01:13:02,370
<i>Chun Jung Myung, out.</i>

1043
01:13:04,910 --> 01:13:09,310
-Lee Kwang Soo...seriously...
-Giraffe...seriously!

1044
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:11,580
I'm sorry!

1045
01:13:11,580 --> 01:13:15,270
I know you're lying.
You just wait 'til next week.

1046
01:13:15,540 --> 01:13:18,240
JYP.  You're going to regret it now.

1047
01:13:18,240 --> 01:13:21,150
Why did he do that?
I can't understand this kid.

1048
01:13:24,640 --> 01:13:29,340
How fun would it have been if he worked
together and got Ha Ha together?

1049
01:13:29,890 --> 01:13:32,080
I think he may really be dumb...

1050
01:13:33,360 --> 01:13:35,420
There could have been so many
different scenarios.

1051
01:13:36,060 --> 01:13:38,440
I knew he would do something like this.

1052
01:13:38,440 --> 01:13:39,790
Jung Myung's really angry right now.

1053
01:13:39,790 --> 01:13:42,270
Jung Myung said right now, 'There could've
been so many different scenarios'

1054
01:13:52,050 --> 01:13:54,130
Kwang Soo.  In your heart...

1055
01:13:54,770 --> 01:13:57,670
I'm sure you're going to have the thought
to rip off my name tag here and there...

1056
01:13:58,160 --> 01:14:00,370
But you have to
think that carefully, Kwang Soo.

1057
01:14:01,040 --> 01:14:03,010
I don't betray my own team member.

1058
01:14:03,010 --> 01:14:05,520
But thoughts like that could
flit across your mind.

1059
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:07,250
-You have to endure it.
-I understand.

1060
01:14:07,250 --> 01:14:09,630
When you see my name tag,
you have to think about it carefully.

1061
01:14:13,900 --> 01:14:15,570
Can you see the tiger's skin there?

1062
01:14:17,610 --> 01:14:19,600
It wouldn't be good if only
your skin remained either, right?

1063
01:14:35,890 --> 01:14:38,310
-I gave you a break this time.
-Thank you, Jong Kook.

1064
01:14:49,460 --> 01:14:50,950
Where are you going?

1065
01:14:51,470 --> 01:14:52,940
-Jong Kook.
-Yes?

1066
01:14:53,300 --> 01:14:56,440
Let's go up one against one.
How about Ha Ha against Kwang Soo?

1067
01:14:58,590 --> 01:15:00,500
Let me discuss this with him.

1068
01:15:01,910 --> 01:15:04,930
Don't you think this is too silly?

1069
01:15:05,140 --> 01:15:07,650
But if you're that afraid of Kwang Soo,
then forget it.

1070
01:15:09,200 --> 01:15:11,950
Get out here, Ha Ha!
Get out here, Ha Ha!

1071
01:15:16,710 --> 01:15:19,920
This is going to be very curious!

1072
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:23,610
Hey...Running Man's viewers
are really going to be curious about it.

1073
01:15:24,310 --> 01:15:27,410
Seriously...I can't believe this is happening.

1074
01:15:29,650 --> 01:15:32,350
Chok-Speed-Cross!

1075
01:15:35,060 --> 01:15:38,000
Come here...lift your head...

1076
01:15:39,540 --> 01:15:41,130
Come here.  Turn around.

1077
01:15:41,130 --> 01:15:44,570
Wake up.
Look at me!  Come here!

1078
01:15:47,050 --> 01:15:49,240
[Haroro vs. Giraffe!]

1079
01:15:50,050 --> 01:15:54,190
-Wait a minute...
-Maybe I should do it.  I'm so nervous!

1080
01:15:54,480 --> 01:15:57,460
Ha Ha.  If you lose this,
you're Running Man's weakest link.

1081
01:15:57,880 --> 01:16:01,080
-Stand.
-I'm going to pick some pebbles first.

1082
01:16:02,050 --> 01:16:03,220
-Stand.
-There's glass here too.

1083

You're not going to fall...</i>

1084
01:16:11,430 --> 01:16:14,590
-I'll give you one more chance.
-Nice, nice.

1085
01:16:15,260 --> 01:16:17,000
Kwang Soo...

1086
01:16:17,470 --> 01:16:22,050
I promised myself that I wouldn't get rough...
I'm sorry, mother.

1087
01:16:22,400 --> 01:16:24,740
For the last time,
I'm going to be a little rough.

1088
01:16:26,130 --> 01:16:27,550
Hey, are you ready?

1089
01:16:40,070 --> 01:16:42,810
[Man vs. Man

absolutely everything they can.]

[These two men are quite serious]

1092
01:17:16,070 --> 01:17:18,170
If they keep that up,
will they become windmills?

1093
01:17:18,170 --> 01:17:19,660
What are they doing right now?

1094
01:17:27,810 --> 01:17:28,940
That hurts!

1095
01:17:35,390 --> 01:17:37,560
He's biting me!

1096
01:17:39,800 --> 01:17:41,310
Hey!

1097
01:17:41,860 --> 01:17:43,570

Did you get it?

1101
01:18:50,230 --> 01:18:54,350

-Hello.
-Hello, sir.

It took too long, didn't it?

1106
01:19:23,610 --> 01:19:28,440
-This is what I have to pay you.
-Thank you!
