-Go up a little bit more!  Up more!
-We have to go up a little bit more!

-Ha Ha.  Come up here.
-Protect Ji Hyo!

to notice the assassin]

-Over there. He's behind the car over there!
-Where?

Ugh.  I'm so nervous.

703

first priority is to protect Ji Hyo]

Is really satisfactory and exciting.

pause for a minute and then go again.

743

Pause and then go...
Keep your eyes open.

-Yes.  Keep an eye out on the back.

I'm situated here right now,
but go help #3.

And why... did you get so scared?

796
00:54:40,238 --> 00:54:42,908
I didn't even think of it...
I was supposed to be the sniper.

[Be especially careful of open spaces,
or a crowded space]

-It's not?

814

-No, it's not.  It's their navigation.

[They're starting to suspect everything]

816
00:55:46,726 --> 00:55:49,264

01:08:10,077 --> 01:08:13,249
You can follow me.
I don't want to feel like I'm being dragged.

995
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:20,116
These 2 were in the case.

996
01:08:20,550 --> 01:08:23,352
Baroque... Baroque?

997
01:08:24,355 --> 01:08:26,566
Baroque is an art form...?

998
01:08:26,828 --> 01:08:28,906
Ah... Baroque is an art form?

999
01:08:29,276 --> 01:08:32,193
How can you not even know that
Baroque is an art form?

1000
01:08:32,194 --> 01:08:34,079
[Ignorant]

1001
01:08:34,507 --> 01:08:36,055
Want some Chinese?

1002
01:08:36,471 --> 01:08:38,615
[What is he talking about all of a sudden?]

1003
01:08:39,092 --> 01:08:41,565
Baroque Chinese?  Korean?  English?

1004
01:08:41,565 --> 01:08:44,391
[Korean word 'Ignorant' sounds like a form
of cuisine, like Chinese, Korean, etc]

1005
01:08:48,323 --> 01:08:51,198
-I've even shuffled through like this...
-You've done all that?

1006
01:08:51,199 --> 01:08:52,966
Yeah.  I did it all, and there's nothing.

1007
01:08:52,967 --> 01:08:54,470
[Even though he's done several things,
nothing is found within the book]

1008
01:08:57,232 --> 01:08:59,524
This isn't anything too crazy.

1009
01:09:00,909 --> 01:09:04,295
[Whenever they get a chance,
they fight over it saying it's theirs.]

1010
01:09:04,296 --> 01:09:05,854
If you keep being like this,
I'm going to call Gary.

1011
01:09:05,855 --> 01:09:07,472
-Give you what?
-You're going to make this more difficult.

1012
01:09:07,473 --> 01:09:09,898
Just give it to me.
It doesn't matter anyways.

1013
01:09:10,343 --> 01:09:12,503
We have to find out the information.

1014
01:09:12,504 --> 01:09:14,630
[Huh?  Gary?!]

1015
01:09:17,013 --> 01:09:19,465
[Ultimately... Gary also joins]
Suk Jin.

1016
01:09:20,558 --> 01:09:22,698
[The more that gather around,
the hint is shared and it's disadvantageous]

1017
01:09:22,699 --> 01:09:26,024
-Gary... What's inside there?
-Why don't the 3 of us share?

1018
01:09:31,656 --> 01:09:33,958
What's the deal with the books?

1019
01:09:36,218 --> 01:09:40,362
[Huh?  The paper is peeling off easily?]

1020
01:09:40,363 --> 01:09:42,692
[So rip off the book pages carelessly]

1021
01:09:47,159 --> 01:09:50,572
[Ha Ha feels as though he may have something]

1022
01:09:51,325 --> 01:09:52,637
No, that's probably nothing.

1023
01:09:58,692 --> 01:10:01,115
[No matter what others say,
Ha Ha continues on...]

1024
01:10:01,116 --> 01:10:02,749
Since we all agreed to join,
let's do it together.

1025
01:10:03,850 --> 01:10:06,182
[Huh?  The paper is peeling on the front too?]

1026
01:10:06,183 --> 01:10:08,057
I think someone stuck this on there?

1027
01:10:08,978 --> 01:10:12,426
[Something is
a little suspicious at this point?]

1028
01:10:14,667 --> 01:10:17,089
Something on here.
Something's been stuck here.

1029
01:10:17,253 --> 01:10:18,900
I'm sure that wasn't originally there.

1030
01:10:19,486 --> 01:10:21,545
That's not something that was
originally on the book!

1031
01:10:23,948 --> 01:10:26,806
[Inside is the real book cover!]

1032
01:10:28,842 --> 01:10:31,449
[On the back,
the real book cover is also on the inside!]

1033
01:10:31,450 --> 01:10:33,988
[By this point, it's a guarantee
that something is in the book!]

1034
01:10:33,989 --> 01:10:35,579
Something is in here.

1035
01:10:39,467 --> 01:10:42,420
[There's something inside
the real book cover!]

1036
01:10:42,421 --> 01:10:45,649
[Something is in there!]

1037
01:10:48,703 --> 01:10:51,046
[As soon as Jae Suk takes it,
Ha Ha bites his hand!]

1038
01:10:54,684 --> 01:10:58,002
[The 2 kids that won't give it up]

1039
01:11:00,708 --> 01:11:03,287
-Ha Ha... Hang on.
-You took this from me.

1040
01:11:03,449 --> 01:11:05,717
-You shouldn't have taken it from me.
-Okay.

1041
01:11:07,612 --> 01:11:08,927
Okay.

1042
01:11:08,928 --> 01:11:12,336
[But first, what is it that they found?]

1043
01:11:12,337 --> 01:11:15,828
[Cell phone battery!]

1044
01:11:15,829 --> 01:11:17,591
It's a battery.

1045
01:11:17,592 --> 01:11:19,916
Hand this to me.  Give this to me.

1046
01:11:19,917 --> 01:11:22,091
There's a cell phone around here somewhere.

1047
01:11:22,371 --> 01:11:24,223
[Bingo!  Suk Jin has it]

1048
01:11:24,224 --> 01:11:25,950
But why are you holding on to this?

1049
01:11:25,951 --> 01:11:29,409
You know I can't give it to you.
I can't let it go right now!

1050
01:11:29,410 --> 01:11:31,265
Then let's do this.

1051
01:11:31,848 --> 01:11:33,056
Give it to me right now.

1052
01:11:34,020 --> 01:11:36,136
Calm down Ha Ha... Don't be like this.

1053
01:11:36,137 --> 01:11:37,908
Let's do it this way...

1054
01:11:42,983 --> 01:11:45,440
<i>Did you fart or something?!</i>

1055
01:11:45,441 --> 01:11:47,605
Are you going to keep following me?

1056
01:11:48,145 --> 01:11:51,110
I wasn't following you,
but I'm here to get my things back.

1057
01:11:52,462 --> 01:11:54,785
This was mine from the beginning.

1058
01:11:54,786 --> 01:11:56,435
No!  Shall we do it the legal way?

1059
01:11:56,436 --> 01:12:01,366
Even though you had it first,
you undoubtedly exchanged it with me.

1060
01:12:01,367 --> 01:12:02,933
-In that case...
-You want to do this the legal way?

1061
01:12:02,934 --> 01:12:05,054
-Yes.  Let's do this the lawful way.
-The lawful way?

1062
01:12:06,489 --> 01:12:07,836
Do you even know where to go?

1063
01:12:07,837 --> 01:12:10,068
I used to work in the law force.

1064
01:12:10,506 --> 01:12:14,330
-I'm asking if you know where to go first?
-Yes.  We can go to the complaints department.

1065
01:12:14,331 --> 01:12:16,527
Then we can go to the criminal appeals court.

1066
01:12:16,528 --> 01:12:18,095
-Criminal appeals court?
-That's right.

1067
01:12:18,096 --> 01:12:20,446
You're going to become a criminal.

1068
01:12:20,447 --> 01:12:22,297
This is a civil case!

1069
01:12:22,298 --> 01:12:24,455
-This is a civil case!
-Criminal case!

1070
01:12:25,529 --> 01:12:27,353
Is it because I'm your hyung?
(a play on Korean words)

1071
01:12:27,827 --> 01:12:29,907
-Is it because I'm your hyung?
-Yeah... That's right!

1072
01:12:30,032 --> 01:12:33,029
If this isn't a civil case,
it goes to criminal court,

1073
01:12:33,030 --> 01:12:34,783
and it gets passed up to the supreme court!

1074
01:12:35,091 --> 01:12:37,605
Do you want to get shackled up in there?!

1075
01:12:37,606 --> 01:12:39,713
Hand it over then!

1076
01:12:40,679 --> 01:12:43,736
-Give it to me!
-Why would I give it to you?

1077
01:12:45,721 --> 01:12:48,948
[On the other hand, Mr. Capable and Ace
who have pear juice in their possession...]

1078
01:12:48,949 --> 01:12:51,892
Since there's no solution...
Let's drink all this up for now.

1079
01:12:51,893 --> 01:12:54,591
-Let's drink it.
-Okay.  Hurry up and drink it.

1080
01:12:54,592 --> 01:12:56,193
-Everyone take one and drink it.
-Hurry up and drink it.

1081
01:12:56,194 --> 01:12:59,175
This is medicinal.  It's really good for you.

1082
01:12:59,176 --> 01:13:02,618
This is good for you.
Everyone take one.

1083
01:13:05,888 --> 01:13:07,105
Hurry up and drink it.

1084
01:13:07,140 --> 01:13:09,007
You've been having a hard time chasing
after me these days, right?

1085
01:13:11,572 --> 01:13:14,581
[No matter what the reason may be,
the staff members have their windfall!]

1086
01:13:14,582 --> 01:13:17,844
-There's nothing in here...
-Something got to be...

1087
01:13:17,845 --> 01:13:20,457
Come here.  Everyone drink one more each.
Ugh, so bitter!

1088
01:13:22,765 --> 01:13:25,528
What if there's really nothing in here?

1089
01:13:26,833 --> 01:13:29,203
[It can't be just pear juice.
I'm sure there's something in here!

1090
01:13:31,176 --> 01:13:32,493
[A little while later]

1091
01:13:32,494 --> 01:13:36,097
[That many pear juices annihilated?]

1092
01:13:37,284 --> 01:13:38,729
There was nothing?

1093
01:13:38,730 --> 01:13:41,355
[But as for the hint...]

1094
01:13:41,356 --> 01:13:43,157
There's some more here!  Oh!

1095
01:13:44,413 --> 01:13:47,428
-Seriously Jong Kook!  I drank all that!
-I drank all that too!

1096
01:13:47,429 --> 01:13:50,901
After all that, when I picked this up,
I saw something on the inside!

1097
01:13:51,174 --> 01:13:53,429
[Why did it have to be the last one?]

1098
01:13:54,310 --> 01:13:56,474
Why did it have to be the last one?

1099
01:13:56,475 --> 01:13:58,141
I put it here for you to drink, Ki Jin!

1100
01:13:58,142 --> 01:14:00,268
I left it here for you to drink!

1101
01:14:00,531 --> 01:14:03,009
[Something can be seen on the inside]
Hurry up and drink it.

1102
01:14:03,488 --> 01:14:06,516
Jong Kook.  Don't suck it all down.
Make sure you don't gulp it down!

1103
01:14:06,992 --> 01:14:10,701
-It won't be good to drink it in?
-Then we have to wait until you poop it out.

1104
01:14:14,569 --> 01:14:18,134
I really...
I really didn't think I'd go this far.

1105
01:14:18,719 --> 01:14:20,878
To make us drink all this?

1106
01:14:21,487 --> 01:14:24,234
[Looks like a piece of paper inside...]
Let's see.

1107
01:14:25,537 --> 01:14:29,753
[Number... 1307?]

1108
01:14:34,205 --> 01:14:36,844
[Just what could this number represent?]

1109
01:14:36,845 --> 01:14:39,826
Just think about this.
I don't think it represents a page number.

1110
01:14:39,938 --> 01:14:41,961
Jong Kook... Department number!

1111
01:14:43,946 --> 01:14:45,949
Just throw this away.

1112
01:14:45,950 --> 01:14:48,992
-That battery...
-There was a battery?

1113
01:14:48,993 --> 01:14:50,725
Jae Suk has it!

1114
01:14:52,427 --> 01:14:56,546
[To be precise, inside Jae Suk's shoe]

1115
01:15:07,640 --> 01:15:08,722
There he is.

1116
01:15:08,723 --> 01:15:11,523
-Oh my...
-Hello everyone.

1117
01:15:11,898 --> 01:15:14,935
[Confiscated the case that Jong Kook
and Ji Hyo have thrown away]

1118
01:15:15,326 --> 01:15:16,470
Have a seat.

1119
01:15:17,081 --> 01:15:20,253
Hey.  There's nothing in the case
that Jong Kook left.

1120
01:15:23,050 --> 01:15:26,263
[The tennis shoes which had the cell phone
inside has returned here]

1121
01:15:26,264 --> 01:15:28,027
You know there was a cell phone in here.

1122
01:15:30,303 --> 01:15:31,728
Ah... I see...

1123
01:15:32,299 --> 01:15:33,828
You're not seeing it?

1124
01:15:34,552 --> 01:15:36,413
I told you there was newspaper in here.

1125
01:15:36,414 --> 01:15:39,307
As soon as I saw this, I knew it.

1126
01:15:39,308 --> 01:15:41,255
This is not the size of a newspaper.

1127
01:15:41,256 --> 01:15:43,143
[He should've at least pretended never
to have seen the running shoes]

1128
01:15:43,144 --> 01:15:44,549
Do you see how his face is getting red?

1129
01:15:44,550 --> 01:15:47,412
Did you see?  Everyone was curious as
I was taking this out,

1130
01:15:47,413 --> 01:15:50,277
but there was just one person
that wasn't curious at all.

1131
01:15:50,658 --> 01:15:53,686
Therefore,
it means that you have the cell phone.

1132
01:15:53,687 --> 01:15:55,396
You hid it somewhere, right?

1133
01:15:55,397 --> 01:15:58,022
[He's sharp... At this rate, the cell phone
may even become Jae Suk's]

1134
01:15:59,133 --> 01:16:01,478
Grab him!  Hurry up and grab him!

1135
01:16:01,479 --> 01:16:02,550
[Ha Ha starts an attack on Jae Suk!]

1136
01:16:03,129 --> 01:16:05,707
[Give me my battery!]
Where is it?

1137
01:16:07,476 --> 01:16:11,527
[The cold relationship between the
Running Men members]

1138
01:16:19,684 --> 01:16:22,691
[Ha Ha knows Jae Suk too well...]
[Running off with the battery!]

1139
01:16:23,970 --> 01:16:26,917
[Ha Ha runs off with the battery!]

1140
01:16:28,052 --> 01:16:32,117
[Suk Jin with the cell phone chasing after
Ha Ha as if his life depends on it]

1141
01:16:32,118 --> 01:16:33,971
Let's get that from Ha Ha!

1142
01:16:35,266 --> 01:16:38,021
-Who tickled me?
-I did.

1143
01:16:39,717 --> 01:16:41,363
Hey, where did he go?

1144
01:16:41,364 --> 01:16:44,331
[This is what he's up to]

1145
01:16:44,332 --> 01:16:46,330
-Hey... Let go!
-Over here.  He has it here.

1146
01:16:46,331 --> 01:16:48,077
I got it!

1147
01:16:48,690 --> 01:16:50,672
[The giraffe runs off with the battery!]

1148
01:16:51,057 --> 01:16:54,570
[With this the Easy Brothers get their hands
on both the phone and the battery!]

1149
01:16:57,724 --> 01:16:59,346
Jong Kook!  Hurry up and catch these guys!

1150
01:17:00,822 --> 01:17:02,230
[They don't even know about the cell phone
and the battery.  Only the number 1307]

1151
01:17:02,231 --> 01:17:04,323
That team is in total uproar right now.

1152
01:17:04,324 --> 01:17:06,953
What is it that they have
that they're in such uproar?

1153
01:17:08,837 --> 01:17:12,592
There must be an uproar with
quite the betrayal going on there?

1154
01:17:12,593 --> 01:17:14,621
I see quite the chaos over there.

1155
