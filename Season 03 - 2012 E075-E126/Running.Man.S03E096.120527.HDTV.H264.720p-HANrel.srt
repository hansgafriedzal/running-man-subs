00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:03,500
Yes, that's right.

-Have you ever watched our program?
-Yes.  I watch it often.

15
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:12,160
I know you must be really busy during season,
do you have the time to watch TV?

16
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:14,640
Yes.  We have lots of time to watch it.

17
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,810
He's so honest.  So honest...!

18
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:20,210
He was so honest about it,
that I got flustered!

19
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:24,200
By any chance, does Coach Ferguson...?
[Is the coach of Manchester United also a viewer?]

20
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,760
What are you talking about right now?

21
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:29,100
Maybe Coach Ferguson catches what
Park Ji Sung is watching..

22
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:31,990
-And he could ask..
-What is this?

23
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:34,340
This is Gary!

24
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:39,000
I don't know about the coach...
but Abram watches it.

25
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,730
He watches it!

26
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:45,050
Abram!  Abram watches it!

27
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:48,700
-Who knew that he'd be watching us?
This is truly an honor.

28
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:51,540
Abram... wow!
Is it fun?

29
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,920

31
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:04,980
Are you going to be okay if we tear off your
name tag and stuff while doing this with us?

32
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:07,060
Yes.  I'm confident that I won't get caught.

33
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:10,900
I'm begging you, but please tear it off
of Jong Kook's back once.

34
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:13,250
Jong Kook is just impossible for us!

35
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:16,350
<i>If you win the race
playing against Park Ji Sung,</i>

36

<i>You'll win an invitation to
Asiana Dream Cup,</i>

41
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:35,310
[That first step!  Psychic soccer!]

42
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:38,960
[Just what does psychic soccer mean...?]

43
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:42,410
Do you by any chance know what it is?

44
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:45,190
-Using the psychic powers...
-Yes.  The man who controls the time...?

45
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,230
Do you know death note?
My death note?

46
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:52,530
Death note...
Wasn't it picked as the least popular?

47
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:56,520
[Out of all the member's powers,
Kwang Soo's voted the least desirable]

48
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,860

54
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,270
<i>You're saying there's another guest?!</i>

55
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:24,350
-Someone else is coming?  Who's coming?
-Come on out!!

56
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,950
Who is it?  Please come out!

57
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:37,240
[Wow!!  The nation's little sister, IU!!]

58
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:43,540
[Speechless...turns to embarrassment]

59
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:48,690
[The nation's little sister,
and the worldwide soccer star meet]

60
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:54,560
Is Ji Hyo that lacking?

61
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:58,770
Park Ji Sung all of a sudden
seems very embarrassed.

62
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:00,410
Why are you standing so far apart?

63
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:03,290
-Why are you being like that all of a sudden?
-Yeah.  Go stand next to her.

64
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:07,960
What's it like to see Park Ji Sung, IU?

65
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,510
It's so amazing!

66
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:12,250
It's like that for us too.

67
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:14,610
We're just pretending not to be like that.
[In truth, members of Running Man agree]

68
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:17,570
<i>Now we're going to start the psychic soccer.</i>

69
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:21,470
<i>With the exception of Park Ji Sung,
everyone else will have 1 psychic power.</i>

70
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:22,970
Why aren't you giving me one?

71
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:26,560
Park Ji Sung is asking
why you're not giving him one.

72
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,920
What is it that you want to have?

73
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,250
-A psychic power?
-Yes.

74
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:31,120
The power to dominate space.

75
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:36,530
That's my power.

76
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:38,840
Why don't you try shouting out
domination of balls?

77
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,660
Do you know how embarrassing it is?

78
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:42,720
[Even though it may be nice,
it's probably very embarrassing to shout out]

79
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:49,130
[It's actually very embarrassing to
shout it out in front of people]

80
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:51,540
-When I say mine...
-Show me.  Show me how you do it.

81
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:53,640
You have to do it with charisma...

82
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:56,590
Pull it up like this, and raise it...
That's right.

83
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:00,910
Dominate the space...

84
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:02,810
You have to finish it!

85
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:04,040
[Trying to do it seriously and
finds it embarrassing]

86
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,950
-You have to finish it!
-Oh, I'm so embarrassed!

87
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:14,100
Okay.  I'll give it another try.
[Demonstrating again with gritted teeth]

88
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:18,830
[The man who dominates space!]

89
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,990
[If done properly, the effect is visible]

90
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:24,580
-Why don't you give it a try, Park Ji Sung?
-Like this?

91
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:26,300
I just have to do it like this, right?

92
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:30,600
The man who dominates space!

93
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:34,420
<i>The man who dominates space!</i>

94
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:42,120
<i>That's not very cool!</i>

95
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,400
You were very serious about it!
[The aftermath of embarrassment]

96
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:47,300
If you can get a psychic power,
what would you like to have?

97
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:48,950
-I'd want the death note.
-Why?

98
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:50,140
Who would you kill off?

99
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:54,510
-If we're playing soccer...
-Yes, you can kick them off.

100
00:05:54,510 --> 00:06:01,510
Then Park Ji Sung...
[With the death note, Park Ji Sung...?]

101
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:03,540
You're saying you're going to kill me off?!

102
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,020
You can't do that!

103
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:09,290
I'm saying if he was on the opposing team.
Only if he's on the other team.

104
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:10,810
She's scary...

105
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:14,320
[Wait for it!]
[Scary Girl, IU's surprising action!]

106
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,380
<i>First.  There will need to be 2 teams.</i>

107
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:18,210
<i>I'll announce the captain for each team.</i>

108
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:21,550
-For 1 team, without a doubt...
-It's Park Ji Sung.

109
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:24,000
[One of the teams' captain is Park Ji Sung]

110
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:26,210
<i>The captain for the other team is...</i>

111
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:28,870
-Kim Jong Kook.
-I knew it!

112
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:31,140
Why are you doing that?!

113
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:34,250
<i>Only one of the Running Man members
can go on Park Ji Sung's team.</i>

114
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:36,020
-I'll go.
-Come on...

115
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,880
I can just go! Me!

116
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,810
I think we can make a go of it.

117
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:43,530
-You'll be okay, right, Park Ji Sung?
-No, that's not okay.

118
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:48,400
You're even giving them psychic powers...

119
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,630
[2-member Park Ji Sung's team vs.
7-member Running Man's team]

120
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:56,330
<i>Park Ji Sung will start to tear off the name
tag from members he doesn't want on his team.</i>

121
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:00,930
Is there anyone specific that you want?

122
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:03,000
No, not a single one of them.

123
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:05,970
I can just go behind them and tear it off?

124
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:17,900
I'm really looking forward to today.

125
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:23,610
[Yes, you can look forward to it]

126
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:27,270
[First off, Suk Jin is eliminated
from Ji Sung's team]

127
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:32,420
Now the game can start for the day!

128
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:37,430
<i>He ripped it off without even hesitating!</i>

129
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:40,940
He rips it off with such delight.

130
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,630
[First Suk Jin goes off to Jong Kook's team]
[Who's next to be eliminated?]

131
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:47,440
[Ji Sung's ripped off one person's tag,
Ji Suk Jin's...]

132
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:52,550
-Ji Suk Jin's...
[In the middle of his speech...!]

133
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:59,320
This time too, he tears it off
in such an entertaining way!]

134
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:01,070
That's awesome!

135
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:05,690
Park Ji Sung... Do you not have any intentions
of coming on the show often from now on?

136
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:09,600
[Even the nation's most famous MC lusts for
Park Ji Sung's appearance on his show]

137
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,740
-Isn't his timing the best?
-His timing is an art form.

138
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:16,750
That's awesome... Seriously...
[Then who's the 3rd to be eliminated?]

139
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:18,740
-I was expecting it...
-I'm sure you were expecting it.

140
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:20,950
It would've been fun.
I feel a little saddened by it.

141
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:26,170
-I'm seriously nervous!
-My heart is pounding!

142
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:30,140
-My heart is racing!
-I'm sorry...

143
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:35,220
-I'm sorry.
-Song Ji Hyo! Come over here.

144
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:38,250
You think you'd be picked
when IU is standing next to you?

145
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:41,740
[A sudden surprise
during a brief moment of reprieve]

146
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,190
Come here.

147
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:51,990
My heart really hurt...
I feel like I've just been dumped.

148
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:54,610
You feel like you've been dumped?

149
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:57,470
[Not being on the same team with Ji Sung
makes it feel like one's been broken up with]

150
00:08:57,710 --> 00:08:59,550
<i>I wonder who's it's going to be?</i>

151
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:00,850
[Only ones that are left.
IU-Kwang Soo-Gary.  3 people!]

152
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:03,020
Don't expect anything, Kwang Soo.

153
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:04,340
I'm sorry!

154
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:06,660
<i>I'm sorry!</i>

155
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:08,220
[IU's whole body gets dragged!]

156
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:11,760
[Since she's so light,
she gets pulled along with the name tag]

157
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:15,290
[Ji Sung... Totally flustered]

158

[Captain Park in total shock]

159
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,260
No, I'm fine.  I'm okay.

160
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:26,400
It's because you're not strong.
[IU also eliminated from Ji Sung's team]

161
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,960
-It's just the 2 of them now.
-No way!

162
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,420
That seriously makes no sense!

163
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:35,020
Then... Why don't you each show us
your soccer skills?

164

[Great ad-lib that even took the
nation's MC by surprise]

656
00:45:31,350 --> 00:45:34,410
I'm not just saying this because
Park Ji Sung's here,

657
00:45:34,410 --> 00:45:35,820
but it's not easy what you're doing.

658

[Captain Park, who has been playing pro soccer
overseas for more than 10 years]

659
00:45:40,570 --> 00:45:43,270
-There's the difference in language too.
That's what I'm saying.

660
00:45:43,270 --> 00:45:44,530
It really isn't easy work.

661
00:45:44,530 --> 00:45:46,690
Your English probably wasn't very good
in the beginning either, right?

662
00:45:46,690 --> 00:45:48,380
That's right.
I couldn't speak English very well.

663
00:45:48,380 --> 00:45:52,060
It must've been hard for you to communicate.
Especially during the games...?

664
00:45:52,230 --> 00:45:55,780
Well when it comes to matches...
All the terms are pretty similar.

665
00:45:55,780 --> 00:45:58,830
Since the terms are pretty much the same,
there's not a huge problem.

666
00:45:59,130 --> 00:46:04,210
But when there were meetings before matches,
I didn't have any translators.

667
00:46:04,210 --> 00:46:05,810
-How did you do it then?
-You really didn't have any?

668
00:46:05,810 --> 00:46:08,770
Well you know... I did what I could
to get my point across with my gestures.

669
00:46:09,330 --> 00:46:12,170
-They understood what they could.
-I'm sure that wasn't easy...

670
00:46:12,210 --> 00:46:14,260
What about when the coach was explaining
his plans and everything...?

671
00:46:14,260 --> 00:46:17,680
When the coach was explaining something
to the whole team...

672
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:20,030
Um... I just sat there
with a blank expression on my face.

673
00:46:21,130 --> 00:46:24,690
With just a blank expression...
[Pretending to understand]

674
00:46:25,420 --> 00:46:29,930
The coach and the staff must think that
he at least understood a little bit of it.

675
00:46:30,870 --> 00:46:35,000
I understand it now...
but in the beginning... I was a blank.

Just pretending like I understood everything...

677
00:46:40,060 --> 00:46:42,630
My coach asks me once in awhile
if I understood what he said.

678
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:44,660
-Then what do you say?
-That yes, I understood.

that I'm curious about...</i>

680

What's Rooney, the soccer player like?

683
00:47:01,730 --> 00:47:03,740
He's lying about his age, isn't he?

684
00:47:04,070 --> 00:47:06,300
There are people who make fun of that too.

685
00:47:06,970 --> 00:47:09,560
-That they need to see his birth certificate.
-Seriously?

686

Yes.  That he's lying about it.

seen behind your coach?

[The bewildered expression from
the dramatic loss of the game]

690

Then it wasn't taken by an accident,
but you really...

691
00:47:26,250 --> 00:47:29,230
Yes, in reality...
I didn't know someone took a picture of that.

692
00:47:29,460 --> 00:47:31,450
I had no idea that someone was
taking a picture...

01:26:59,300 --> 01:27:02,020
By myself?  Ah, I see.

1291
01:27:02,060 --> 01:27:06,500
You will be given 500 Baht for
each of those goals.

1292
01:27:09,490 --> 01:27:12,140
If that was the case,
I would've made all the goals myself.

1293
01:27:13,150 --> 01:27:15,530
I guess that's all I can do about that.

1294
01:27:16,080 --> 01:27:21,670
You will start off with 3500 baht.

1295
01:27:23,500 --> 01:27:24,820
Just for now.

1296
01:27:24,820 --> 01:27:28,430
Who else would you pick
other than Kim Jong Kook?

1297
01:27:29,370 --> 01:27:30,610
I don't know...

1298
01:27:30,610 --> 01:27:33,130
I feel like Gary's going to
get caught quickly.

1299
01:27:34,960 --> 01:27:38,530
If... I had the money...

1300
01:27:38,890 --> 01:27:41,020
I would take Song Ji Hyo.

1301
01:27:41,020 --> 01:27:46,760
But that would be hard since the big timers
usually don't get transferred easily.

1302
01:27:47,450 --> 01:27:50,130
If they don't want it themselves,
it usually doesn't work.

1303
01:27:51,250 --> 01:27:53,310
Ah... I don't know who it may be,

1304
01:27:53,310 --> 01:27:56,890
I will work hard with my fellow spy...

1305
01:27:57,070 --> 01:28:02,190
Since we didn't win any this season...
On Running Man, I'll make sure...

1306
01:28:02,190 --> 01:28:04,980
To show the winning side of me.
Fighting!

1307
01:28:07,900 --> 01:28:10,450
Kim Jong Kook and Park Ji Sung
need to go up against one another.

1308
01:28:10,450 --> 01:28:11,750
Where did Park Ji Sung go?

1309
01:28:11,750 --> 01:28:14,710
[The hottest face-off
in Running Man's history]

1310
01:28:14,710 --> 01:28:16,590
Come on!

1311
01:28:16,590 --> 01:28:18,270
[Strength vs. speed!]

1312
01:28:18,750 --> 01:28:19,870
[Stamina vs. Stamina]

1313
01:28:20,600 --> 01:28:22,000
[A face-off that's on a different dimension]

1314
01:28:23,740 --> 01:28:26,400
[And Jae Suk's secret mission...?]
You're not playing a joke, right?

1315
01:28:27,550 --> 01:28:30,150
[Park Ji Sung to carry out
Yoo Jae Suk's mission!]

1316
01:28:30,150 --> 01:28:31,470
Who's that?

1317
01:28:31,470 --> 01:28:33,340
[Jung Dae Sae]
[Rio Ferdinand]

1318
01:28:33,340 --> 01:28:35,590
[The surprising mission with world stars!]

1319
01:28:36,270 --> 01:28:38,970
[2012 Asiana Dream Cup in Thailand!]

1320
01:28:38,970 --> 01:28:41,010
[Running Man touching ground on a dream]

1321
01:28:41,010 --> 01:28:43,430
[Moment of honor they'll remember forever!]

1322
01:28:44,240 --> 01:28:50,520
[Jung Dae Sae and Gae Dae Sae will strike!]

1323
01:28:50,520 --> 01:28:52,520
Running Man!  Fighting!
