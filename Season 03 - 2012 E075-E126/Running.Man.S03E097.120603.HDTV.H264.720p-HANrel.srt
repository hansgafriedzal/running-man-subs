will help you on your spy mission. </i>

5

(An affectionate way to call an older boy/man)

-Ha Ha oppa.
-Ha Ha is an oppa? What about Kwang Soo?

-Kwang Soo is an oppa too.
-What about Jong Kook?  And me?

-I'm not bad too, right?
-What about Ji Sung?

14

Why are you doing this?
[It's finally starting...]

21
00:01:02,401 --> 00:01:07,545
It's personal... It's because Kim Jong Kook and
Park Ji Sung have to go up against each other.

22
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:09,814
That's no good.

23

name off Ji Sung's back is Lee Kwang Soo.

42

-Yes.

00:11:50,157 --> 00:11:53,259
[By any chance, is she Ji Sung's partner?]

163
00:11:57,703 --> 00:12:00,004
I wonder who and why someone tore
the name off of Suk Jin's back?

164
00:12:01,311 --> 00:12:03,714
I wonder if he was had without
any reason again?

165
00:12:05,386 --> 00:12:10,731
[It's welcome since Ji Sung has
to oust everyone anyways]

166
00:12:15,507 --> 00:12:21,245
[A gathering of people in front of Ji Sung...]

167
00:12:21,246 --> 00:12:24,943
[Among those... Ace Ji Hyo!]

168
00:12:24,944 --> 00:12:30,254
[Ji Hyo, who was too expensive to recruit...
Should he oust her at this chance?]

169
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:37,533
[Wait...! Mr. Capable...!]

170
00:12:37,534 --> 00:12:41,806
[The one who was too expensive to recruit...!]

171
00:12:41,807 --> 00:12:46,416
[The one he has to make sure
to oust sometime...!]

172
00:12:51,948 --> 00:12:56,874
[Now... If it's now...]

173
00:13:05,811 --> 00:13:08,490
I just wanted to touch it once.

174
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:12,344
-I just wanted to touch it once.
-Just where did you come from?!

175
00:13:12,345 --> 00:13:14,765
-I just wanted to touch it...
-You really scared me!

176
00:13:15,237 --> 00:13:16,977
This is seriously...!

177
00:13:16,978 --> 00:13:21,327
-Did you find the hint?
-Is it a piece of paper?

178
00:13:21,966 --> 00:13:24,670
[Let's find the hint together for now]

179
00:13:26,689 --> 00:13:28,312
-Ji Hyo.
-You scared me!

180
00:13:29,195 --> 00:13:31,041
Ji Hyo, come over here.

181
00:13:31,042 --> 00:13:32,513
Ji Hyo, we have to work together.

182
00:13:32,514 --> 00:13:34,000
I found it.

183
00:13:34,528 --> 00:13:37,125
[You found it?]

184
00:13:42,344 --> 00:13:43,488
You have the hint?

185
00:13:44,059 --> 00:13:46,035
Inside. Let's go inside.

186
00:13:46,036 --> 00:13:49,743
[Going somewhere where others can't see]

187
00:13:50,995 --> 00:13:54,643
-Everyone has found one so far.
-Really?

188
00:13:54,644 --> 00:13:58,948
[What if Mr. Capable and Ace finds out
the mission before me like this?]

189
00:14:03,089 --> 00:14:05,973
[The hint that Ji Hyo found... 'Song']

190
00:14:05,974 --> 00:14:10,119
[Actually, it's 'Song' of Song Ji Hyo,
but what is Jong Kook's take?]

191
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:12,248
-It's a song...
-It is, right?

192
00:14:12,249 --> 00:14:15,731
It's a song, right?
I thought it meant 'Song', as in my name.

193
00:14:16,457 --> 00:14:19,372
[It is you...]
But I don't it's that simple.  Right?

194
00:14:20,474 --> 00:14:25,985
It's a song.  When we were all gathered
downstairs earlier... And I saw Gary...

195
00:14:26,907 --> 00:14:28,734
And I got a strange feeling.

196
00:14:29,328 --> 00:14:31,541
[Now she's suspecting Gary?]
I think it's Gary.

197
00:14:31,542 --> 00:14:34,316
But I think if we found one more,
we'll be able to figure it out.

198
00:14:35,914 --> 00:14:40,282
-Be honest... Did you find anything?
-I haven't found anything! I promise.

199
00:14:40,317 --> 00:14:43,099
-You seriously haven't found anything?
-No, I haven't.

200
00:14:43,931 --> 00:14:46,294
I'm being serious. Here, I'll show you.

201
00:14:47,141 --> 00:14:50,242
[He's even flipping his pockets inside out]
No, that's okay.

202
00:14:51,027 --> 00:14:53,065
-Take off your shoes.
-Okay.

203
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:58,008
[I need to go find something
on my own quickly too...]

204
00:14:59,213 --> 00:15:00,321
<i>How do I find it?</i>

205
00:15:05,485 --> 00:15:07,016
This isn't it, right?

206
00:15:07,017 --> 00:15:09,341
It has 'R' stuck on it...

207
00:15:09,342 --> 00:15:13,836
I'm sure it's stuck on something.
[He really is searching everywhere]

208
00:15:15,377 --> 00:15:17,743
[The personality of always
seeing things through]

209
00:15:18,212 --> 00:15:19,829
How did they find it so easily?

210
00:15:21,488 --> 00:15:24,124
I wonder if I'm searching
in all the wrong places?

211
00:15:25,024 --> 00:15:26,628
Hello.

212
00:15:28,056 --> 00:15:31,389
They always hide it in the most
unlikeliest places...

213
00:15:32,584 --> 00:15:35,151
I wonder if they're watching me
and laughing right now?

214
00:15:35,753 --> 00:15:38,143
Wondering why I'm doing this...

215
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:41,960
Airport... This looks like an airport.

216
00:15:42,887 --> 00:15:46,611
How do they expect us to find it
in such a big place like this?

217
00:15:51,204 --> 00:15:52,885
This is really...

218
00:15:53,597 --> 00:15:55,637
None of the other members are here.

219
00:15:58,335 --> 00:15:59,650
<i>There's IU. </i>

220
00:15:59,651 --> 00:16:02,323
Where's IU? Hey, be careful of IU.

221
00:16:02,324 --> 00:16:08,220
[The girl who's face may change at
any moment and lunge after you]

222
00:16:08,221 --> 00:16:10,623
Why are you looking at Ha Ha's back?

223
00:16:12,013 --> 00:16:14,259
-You said we were on the same team.
-We are on the same team.

224
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:15,649
IU, where are you going?

225
00:16:16,474 --> 00:16:18,444
[Fiery glint in her eye]
Does she have something?

226
00:16:19,308 --> 00:16:22,196
Did you purposely act like you're tired?

227
00:16:22,609 --> 00:16:24,799
No... I don't have anything like that.

228
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,639
I think you were purposely acting
like you were tired this morning...

229
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,879
[IU is definitely acting strange...?]

230
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,578
I know you found it.  Show us.

231
00:16:31,579 --> 00:16:33,635
-I didn't find anything.
-Let's join forces.

232
00:16:33,636 --> 00:16:35,769
You found it? Really? You did?

233
00:16:36,076 --> 00:16:38,143
-Let me see it.
-I had mine taken away by Jong Kook.

234
00:16:38,144 --> 00:16:39,531
-Really?
-What was it?

235
00:16:39,532 --> 00:16:44,125
I'm sure you know what it is...
Come on now... Hey!

236
00:16:44,779 --> 00:16:46,374
Look at that.  I knew it.

237
00:16:47,119 --> 00:16:49,195
-Let's work together.
-I see everyone found something.

238
00:16:49,196 --> 00:16:52,517
[The exhausted Ji Sung also joins
after all his searching]

239
00:16:52,518 --> 00:16:55,337
Come on, let me see it!

240
00:16:55,927 --> 00:16:58,822
[IU's hint... At least 160 cm]

241
00:16:58,823 --> 00:17:03,609
-Then Ha Ha... And IU are out...
-I'm 161!

242
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:08,936
Then it doesn't narrow anything down!
[The gathering of hints could get dangerous]

243
00:17:12,902 --> 00:17:16,205
<i>[I think we need to oust them one by one 
where no one can see first] </i>

244
00:17:16,206 --> 00:17:17,636
<i>[Everyone is all huddled together...]</i>

245
00:17:17,637 --> 00:17:20,111
<i>[You have to make sure to do it well 
where there's no one around] </i>

246
00:17:24,726 --> 00:17:27,573
-Nothing here.
-Ji Hyo!

247
00:17:27,574 --> 00:17:30,900
-Have you found anything else?
-No.

248
00:17:30,901 --> 00:17:33,721
Really?  Then maybe Ha Ha found it?

249
00:17:33,722 --> 00:17:37,965
-Earlier, Ha Ha...
-Ha Ha was hanging out earlier.

250
00:17:38,604 --> 00:17:41,505
<i>maybe he was just pretending 
that he didn't have it earlier. </i>

251
00:17:43,709 --> 00:17:46,125
I think you guys are suspicious of me.

252
00:17:48,495 --> 00:17:53,947
Oh my gosh! You scared me!
[Captain Park, scaring a lot of people today]

253
00:17:54,877 --> 00:17:58,347
I thought it was one of the staff members
next to me... You scared me!

254
00:17:58,348 --> 00:18:01,074
-That's crazy!
-What are you doing up there?

255
00:18:01,075 --> 00:18:04,252
-You seriously haven't found anything?
-Yes. I can't find it.

256
00:18:04,253 --> 00:18:08,356
The hint IU found is this.
But the hint makes no sense...

257
00:18:08,357 --> 00:18:10,729
Come here, Ji Sung.

258
00:18:13,966 --> 00:18:15,682
Please don't run! You scared me!

259
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:20,024
This... That it's at least 160 cm.
That makes no sense!

260
00:18:20,025 --> 00:18:21,369
Is Ha Ha 160 cm?

261
00:18:21,826 --> 00:18:24,884
It definitely could be Ha Ha...

262
00:18:25,565 --> 00:18:30,188
['Song' 'Single' '160 cm'
Everyone thinks it's Ha Ha]

263
00:18:32,804 --> 00:18:37,140
[Tsk tsk... Actually, it's this person...]

264
00:18:37,712 --> 00:18:39,676
-Kwang Soo!
-It really isn't me!

265
00:18:45,976 --> 00:18:49,415
-Ha Ha... Ha Ha...
-Hurry up and come over here.

266
00:18:49,416 --> 00:18:51,185
[Ha Ha chooses this moment to show]

267
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:54,677
-I told you I really don't have it!
-Hand it over and work with us!

268
00:18:54,678 --> 00:18:56,949
-I don't have it.
-Hurry up and hand it over.

269
00:18:56,950 --> 00:18:59,180
What do you me to give you
when I don't have anything?

270
00:18:59,181 --> 00:19:02,912
-Here. Search me.
-You could've thrown it out somewhere.

271
00:19:02,913 --> 00:19:04,812
You could have hidden it somewhere too.

272
00:19:04,813 --> 00:19:10,799
[Now everyone suspects that Ha Ha is the 
one with the mission attached to his back]

273
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:13,884
-I'm telling you, I really don't have it!
-Look, IU's hand it already back there.

274
00:19:15,236 --> 00:19:19,071
Look at IU... Her hand is already on the tag!

275
00:19:19,072 --> 00:19:24,210
[If anything, Ha Ha is suspecting
Jong Kook who's approaching him]

276
00:19:24,211 --> 00:19:28,838
When you were the spy,
none of us had any idea of it!

277
00:19:32,258 --> 00:19:37,125
IU's staring at your back now.
[IU eyeing Jong Kook's back this time]

278
00:19:37,126 --> 00:19:41,487
-She is really funny!
-When someone approaches her, she screams...!

279
00:19:41,488 --> 00:19:44,164
But if someone turns their back,
she attacks like this.

280
00:19:44,165 --> 00:19:46,323
She really is scary!

281
00:19:46,324 --> 00:19:48,834
Anyways,
I don't think 'Song' means Song Ji Hyo.

282
00:19:48,835 --> 00:19:52,035
That's just way too simple!
[It really is 'song'...]

283
00:19:52,036 --> 00:19:54,949
I really don't have it!  Don't have it!

284
00:19:57,242 --> 00:19:59,462
I'm sure there's something here...

285
00:20:00,529 --> 00:20:05,076
[Gary looking for a hint
far away from everyone...]

286
00:20:10,556 --> 00:20:11,559
Wait!

287
00:20:12,395 --> 00:20:13,630
There it is!

288
00:20:14,652 --> 00:20:16,595
[A hint!]

289
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,510
Hurry!  Did you get it?
You want down?

290
00:20:25,304 --> 00:20:29,480
[Just what is in this piece of paper...?]

291
00:20:34,241 --> 00:20:37,518
[Member hint... 'H'!]

292
00:20:37,781 --> 00:20:42,083
[That's also 'Song Ji Hyo!']

293
00:20:42,608 --> 00:20:43,806
Ji Sung!

294
00:20:46,625 --> 00:20:48,672
-I found a hint!
-Where?

295
00:20:49,415 --> 00:20:50,933
It's decisive!

296
00:20:51,215 --> 00:20:53,381
-It's decisive!
-What is it?

297
00:20:53,764 --> 00:20:55,273
H!!

298
00:20:55,274 --> 00:20:58,225
H, H, H!  H!!

299
00:20:58,969 --> 00:21:01,704
[The hint Gary found... H!]
Really?

300
00:21:02,233 --> 00:21:07,487
[The person they all think of when
the alphabet 'H' is mentioned...?]

301
00:21:10,973 --> 00:21:13,820
-Really?  H?
-Yes!

302
00:21:13,821 --> 00:21:16,654
Hurry!  Hurry!
[IU the first to attack Ha Ha!]

303
00:21:19,245 --> 00:21:25,599
[No one is thinking of Song Ji Hyo's
'H' for her 'Hyo...!']

304
00:21:26,611 --> 00:21:30,285
[Maybe it really is Ha Ha?]
He can't be caught!

305
00:21:31,597 --> 00:21:36,065
[Everyone cornering Ha Ha!]
No, it's not me!

306
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:39,345
It may not be me!  Bring that hint to me!

307
00:21:39,346 --> 00:21:41,012
Bring the hint to me.

308
00:21:41,013 --> 00:21:46,170
-H... it really is H!
[If that's revealed, he could be in trouble!]

309
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:49,407
-Hey, who found it?
-I just found it!

310
00:21:49,408 --> 00:21:52,183
-Show us.  Let us see it.
-I can't.

311
00:21:52,184 --> 00:21:55,598
-H... It really was H.
-Let us see it!

312
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:08,821
How can that be me?  Song Ji Hyo!

313
00:22:08,822 --> 00:22:12,488
Song Ji Hyo.  Song Ji Hyo, 'H'.

314
00:22:12,489 --> 00:22:15,307
[Even with the 'Song' and 'H'...]
No, it's not.

315
00:22:19,119 --> 00:22:21,957
Why are you looking at me?
Why are you looking at me?!

316
00:22:24,112 --> 00:22:26,483
Why does 'H' have to be me?

317
00:22:26,484 --> 00:22:29,525
Then who else can 'H' be?  and 160 cm?

318
00:22:29,526 --> 00:22:33,035
-And a singer too...
-But...

319
00:22:33,666 --> 00:22:36,864
[Ha Ha takes this moment to escape
since he's in danger]

320
00:22:38,994 --> 00:22:41,832
Hey!  I'll go upstairs.

321
00:22:41,833 --> 00:22:44,895
[And Ji Hyo gets away with it again...]

322
00:22:45,417 --> 00:22:47,168
Ah.  It's nice and cool up here.

323
00:22:47,169 --> 00:22:50,676
-Jong Kook.
-Let's not do this, Ha Ha.

324
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:53,058
[Abandonment?]

325
00:22:53,766 --> 00:22:55,350
Jong Kook...

326
00:22:57,697 --> 00:23:00,490
By any chance...
'H' wouldn't mean one man, right?

327
00:23:01,233 --> 00:23:05,246
[What the heck is this about now?]

328
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:08,427
I wasn't going to say this...

329
00:23:09,182 --> 00:23:11,508
-What are you talking about, Jong Kook?
-Nothing.  Come over here.

330
00:23:11,509 --> 00:23:13,501
Come on and let's get started.

331
00:23:14,705 --> 00:23:15,949
What's going on there?

332
00:23:16,610 --> 00:23:18,229
Hey, it's total chaos down there.

333
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:22,837
Get him!  Get Kwang Soo!

334
00:23:22,838 --> 00:23:24,343
[On Ji Sung's persistence,
they're getting rid of Kwang Soo]

335
00:23:24,826 --> 00:23:27,796
[Ji Sung gets rid of Kwang Soo's name tag]

336
00:23:27,797 --> 00:23:30,121
There's something here.
Kwang Soo, you've got something.

337
00:23:30,122 --> 00:23:32,642
[What do you mean, there's something?]

338
00:23:33,424 --> 00:23:37,547
[Anyways, Ji Sung's starting to get rid of
members one by one]

339
00:23:37,548 --> 00:23:41,032
Kwang Soo, I'm sorry.
Seriously... I'm really sorry.

340
00:23:43,606 --> 00:23:48,363
[Now partner... Let's seriously start
getting them ousted!]

341
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:53,202
[Lee Kwang Soo, out]
Kwang Soo's out!

342
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:57,319
Why did they rip of Kwang Soo's?
It's not him!

343
00:23:59,556 --> 00:24:01,420
Then what about you?!

344
00:24:01,421 --> 00:24:03,629
-You're the thorn on my side!
-It's not like that.

345
00:24:04,434 --> 00:24:09,489
Bro... Everything's pointing to you right now,
so what do I do?  I can't trust you.

346
00:24:10,158 --> 00:24:12,924
Jae Suk. Why did you get rid of Kwang Soo?

347
00:24:12,925 --> 00:24:16,581
Don't just tear anyone's off,
and cause problems.

348
00:24:16,982 --> 00:24:20,680
Let's just go about it nicely...
What's with you, IU?

349
00:24:20,681 --> 00:24:25,860
[They've come to get Ha Ha,
but IU approaches the first person she sees]

350
00:24:25,861 --> 00:24:28,625
-And stop approaching me.
-Do you see what IU's doing?

351
00:24:28,626 --> 00:24:31,303
[But IU's behavior definitely
has been weird since earlier]

352
00:24:31,304 --> 00:24:33,492
[Is she... Ji Sung's partner?]

353
00:24:33,493 --> 00:24:36,846
-Let's just rip it off now.
-No!  You can't do it!

354
00:24:37,148 --> 00:24:40,777
[IU runs and latches on to Ha Ha's name tag!]

355
00:24:40,778 --> 00:24:44,810
Wait... Come on, just wait.

356
00:24:44,811 --> 00:24:49,577
[Ji Sung's on pins and needles worried that
'Find the spy' note is on Ha Ha's back]

357
00:24:50,928 --> 00:24:52,257
Why don't you tell us first, Ha Ha.

358
00:24:54,653 --> 00:24:58,708
[IU... Gets rid of Gary's nametag?!]

359
00:25:00,402 --> 00:25:04,675
[Why not Ha Ha's, but Gary's?]

360
00:25:08,571 --> 00:25:11,606
[Ha Ha takes this opportunity to run again!]
Get him!  Hey!

361
00:25:12,212 --> 00:25:14,687
-What are you doing?!
-I thought it was Gary!

362
00:25:14,688 --> 00:25:17,619
I thought for sure the 'H' stood
for Hee Gun! (Gary's given name).

363
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,828
I'm sorry.
[Gary is out!]

364
00:25:21,439 --> 00:25:25,003
-But IU does make sense.
-I really thought he could be the one!

365
00:25:25,004 --> 00:25:27,752
-I thought just in case...
-Yeah, his name is Hee Gun.

366
00:25:27,753 --> 00:25:31,060
IU... How did you think to
rip off Gary's name back there?

367
00:25:31,403 --> 00:25:35,357
Because... He was so insistent about the 'H'.

368
00:25:35,358 --> 00:25:37,223
Why didn't you rip of Ha Ha's
when we were holding on to him?

369
00:25:37,224 --> 00:25:40,909
I kept thinking the whole time
that it was Gary.

370
00:25:47,992 --> 00:25:50,668
Don't you really think you're being too much?

371
00:25:50,669 --> 00:25:54,452
Do we really have to go chasing after him
every time he runs away like this?

372
00:25:54,453 --> 00:25:56,118
But she ripped off Gary's name.

373
00:25:57,570 --> 00:25:58,906
She's here again.  There she is again.

374
00:26:03,505 --> 00:26:05,452
-I!
-I'm holding onto him.

375
00:26:05,453 --> 00:26:08,481
For last time...
so I can be Park Ji Sung's fan...

376
00:26:09,104 --> 00:26:12,468
-Let's have Park Ji Sung catch me.
-Okay.  I'll catch you.

377
00:26:12,469 --> 00:26:14,985
[Park Ji Sung vs. Ha Ha]
[Really?]

378
00:26:16,432 --> 00:26:18,799
-You can catch him and tear it off too.
-Okay.

379
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:21,458
-Yes, I'll catch him.
-But you can't catch me, then that's it.

380
00:26:21,459 --> 00:26:24,772
You can just do whatever you want with him.

381
00:26:25,161 --> 00:26:26,883
Give me 2 seconds.
[Ha Ha gets a 2 second head start]

382
00:26:28,181 --> 00:26:32,136
[Ha Ha... Do you really think
you can run away from Ji Sung?]

383
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:48,893
[The count seems awfully fast...]

384
00:26:55,255 --> 00:26:57,227
[Full speed from the beginning!]

385
00:26:59,022 --> 00:27:04,970
[Exactly... In 5 seconds, he's caught]

386
00:27:10,188 --> 00:27:14,792
[Whew!
His spy identity hasn't been revealed!]

387
00:27:14,793 --> 00:27:18,811
[There's nothing there!]

388
00:27:21,769 --> 00:27:23,725
-There's nothing.  There's nothing.
-What?!

389
00:27:24,322 --> 00:27:28,080
[Everyone was fully convinced that
it would be on Ha Ha's back]

390
00:27:28,081 --> 00:27:30,010
[Is it... Me?]

391
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:33,308
He says there's nothing.

392
00:27:33,982 --> 00:27:36,563
[All of a sudden, IU's suddenly...!]

393
00:27:36,564 --> 00:27:38,213
There's nothing?

394
00:27:42,804 --> 00:27:44,966
[IU finally realizes that it's Song Ji Hyo!]

395
00:27:51,542 --> 00:27:53,718
[Finally!]

396
00:27:53,719 --> 00:27:57,188
[The mission that was hidden on the back!]

397
00:27:57,189 --> 00:27:59,941
[Find the spy!]
What is it?

398
00:27:59,942 --> 00:28:02,278
-Find the spy.
-Find the spy!

399
00:28:05,669 --> 00:28:07,800
-Who's the spy?
-It's not me, it's not me!

400
00:28:07,801 --> 00:28:11,017
[The sudden chaos after
the mission is revealed!]

401
00:28:11,018 --> 00:28:13,697
IU, you have to be careful.
[Only 4 left to the mission now]

402
00:28:14,835 --> 00:28:16,203
Is this the rest now?

403
00:28:16,204 --> 00:28:18,063
Hey!  It was Ji Hyo?

404
00:28:18,064 --> 00:28:19,539
Why the 'H' then?

405
00:28:20,051 --> 00:28:25,254
There's 'H' in Song Ji Hyo, you stupids!
How many times have I told you, you stupids?!

406
00:28:29,001 --> 00:28:32,924
[One spy... And one partner of the spy!]

407
00:28:32,925 --> 00:28:39,463
[And 2 innocent people...]

408
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:42,676
[Just who will be the ultimate winner?]

409
00:28:42,677 --> 00:28:45,480
-This is really hard...
-Isn't it?

410
00:28:45,481 --> 00:28:49,095
Because on the one side,
there's a big possibility that it's Ji Sung.

411
00:28:49,096 --> 00:28:51,886
-But if you look at the behavior, it's her.
-No, it's not!

412
00:28:51,887 --> 00:28:55,271
-It's totally IU!
-Who, me?  No, it's not!

413
00:28:55,272 --> 00:28:57,432
Looking at the behavior... It's her!

414
00:28:57,433 --> 00:28:58,245
[IU is suspicious of how she was
so eager to oust everyone...]

415
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:03,455
No, it's not me.
Just the feeling that I have...

416
00:29:03,549 --> 00:29:10,932
-But... If he is the s... Spy...
-S...S... Spy?!

417
00:29:10,933 --> 00:29:13,947
[Innocent Captain Park...
Stutters when lying?]

418
00:29:13,948 --> 00:29:16,314
-Ji Sung... Don't be so nervous!
-I know.

419
00:29:18,339 --> 00:29:20,116
No, it's because I'm afraid of him.

420
00:29:20,776 --> 00:29:23,436
If Kim Jong Kook isn't the spy,
then it's no problem.

421
00:29:23,437 --> 00:29:25,424
But if he is the spy,
it'll be hard for 2 people to oust him.

422
00:29:25,425 --> 00:29:28,126
-But it's a relief there are 3 of us.
-What he said is right.

423
00:29:28,127 --> 00:29:29,702
That's so true!
[Nice leading!]

424
00:29:29,703 --> 00:29:30,925
It's just that...

425
00:29:30,926 --> 00:29:34,973
If you hadn't said that,
she may have gone to you to rip yours off.

426
00:29:34,974 --> 00:29:36,917
Why are you coming this way again?

427
00:29:38,157 --> 00:29:41,527
[As soon as she hears,
IU locks in on her target]

428
00:29:41,528 --> 00:29:44,435
Why are you coming again? Seriously!

429
00:29:44,436 --> 00:29:48,078
IU is always 2 steps ahead
of what we're thinking.

430
00:29:49,170 --> 00:29:51,962
She really is scary.  She's a scary kid!

431
00:29:51,963 --> 00:29:53,242
She really is no joke!

432
00:29:53,263 --> 00:29:55,832
[Anyways, the tension escalates]

433
00:29:58,328 --> 00:30:02,252
[Jong Kook and Jae Suk leaves the room]

434
00:30:02,253 --> 00:30:03,798
Why are you two leaving together?

435
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:12,144
[Spy Ji Sung...
Your partner is... IU?]

436
00:30:13,176 --> 00:30:15,601
[Jae Suk and Jong Kook meeting in a room]
Let's think about this, Jae Suk.

437
00:30:15,602 --> 00:30:21,565
If by any chance... If by any chance,
Park Ji Sung is the spy...

438
00:30:22,723 --> 00:30:25,231
-I'm so tired.
-Of course, it's exhausting!

439
00:30:27,051 --> 00:30:29,461
I'm really scared of IU right now.

440
00:30:30,761 --> 00:30:35,676
There could be 2 spies...
[Now Mr. Capable nails it on the head!]

441
00:30:35,677 --> 00:30:38,210
There's no rule that it has to be one person.

442
00:30:38,211 --> 00:30:41,878
[Then the spies are IU... And Captain Park?]

443
00:30:43,012 --> 00:30:44,971
If it's those two,
then we're really in trouble.

444
00:30:44,972 --> 00:30:47,626
Let's be honest... It really isn't you?

445
00:30:48,502 --> 00:30:49,849
It's not you, right?

446
00:30:50,114 --> 00:30:53,769
Look at how I'm sitting with you right now.
I did the water gun recently too...

447
00:30:54,353 --> 00:30:56,392
Yeah, you've done enough.

448
00:30:56,513 --> 00:30:58,954
-Jae Suk. Our t-shirts are the same color.
-That's right.

449
00:30:58,955 --> 00:31:01,953
[For once they're working together!]

450
00:31:01,954 --> 00:31:03,402
[Spy confirmed! Let's go get Park Ji Sung!]

451
00:31:03,403 --> 00:31:06,041
-We're doing this. Okay?
-Park Ji Sung is not your average guy.

452
00:31:11,935 --> 00:31:14,635
[All of a sudden, out their door!]

453
00:31:14,636 --> 00:31:17,968
-Just a minute...
-Park Ji Sung!

454
00:31:18,389 --> 00:31:22,459
[Park Ji Sung is finally used
to the role as the spy]

455
00:31:22,958 --> 00:31:26,376
[Suspicious IU is also with him outside...]

456
00:31:29,647 --> 00:31:32,511
-Just a minute...
-Park Ji Sung!

457
00:31:33,202 --> 00:31:35,334
-Park Ji Sung.
-What do we have to press?

458
00:31:42,012 --> 00:31:46,766
[Jae Suk's hand on Jong Kook's back...]

459
00:31:46,767 --> 00:31:50,232
[Could he... Could he?]

460
00:31:50,721 --> 00:31:54,686
<i>You've gathered 18,500 Baht.</i>

461
00:31:58,826 --> 00:32:01,903
[The person with the best spy record lately]

462
00:32:08,605 --> 00:32:09,922
Then...

463
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:13,646
Yoo Jae Suk with his good luck...

464
00:32:13,647 --> 00:32:18,982
[Ji Sung recruits Jae Suk as his partner!]

465
00:32:24,451 --> 00:32:28,662
[The two that met up without anyone
knowing earlier...]

466
00:32:28,663 --> 00:32:30,377
Park Ji Sung.

467
00:32:30,892 --> 00:32:34,234
Why me...
Why did you pick me as the spy?

468
00:32:34,914 --> 00:32:38,611
Everyone is suspicious of me because I
played Yoo-ames Bond not too long ago.

469
00:32:38,612 --> 00:32:40,795
I don't think they'll suspect you
because you were a spy recently.

470
00:32:40,796 --> 00:32:42,693
-That's why you picked me?
-Yes, that's right.

471
00:32:44,168 --> 00:32:46,488
-You have to search every corner.
-Yes, I understand.

472
00:32:46,489 --> 00:32:48,024
I found one hint.

473
00:32:48,025 --> 00:32:49,975
Single. The person is single.

474
00:32:52,489 --> 00:32:56,785
[When everyone thought that the mission
was stuck on Ha Ha's back...]

475
00:32:56,786 --> 00:32:59,086
We have to stop them.  Stop them.

476
00:32:59,087 --> 00:33:02,028
[The two in constant state of anxiety
afraid their spy identities will be revealed]

477
00:33:02,029 --> 00:33:04,809
On Ha Ha's back...
Is a hint that'll lead to us.

478
00:33:07,567 --> 00:33:10,335
It's not me.
[Let's rip it off]

479
00:33:10,597 --> 00:33:15,925
[By convincing people,
they oust members one by one]

480
00:33:16,999 --> 00:33:23,482
[The spy comrades' that were
so in sync together like this...]

481
00:33:27,439 --> 00:33:32,069
[Now... If... We got rid of you...]

482
00:33:39,577 --> 00:33:43,488
-I'm sorry... I'll tell you everything later.

drank the flower tea.
