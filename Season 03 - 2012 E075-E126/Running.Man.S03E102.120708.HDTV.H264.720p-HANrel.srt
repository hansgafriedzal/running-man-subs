00:50:21,616 --> 00:50:24,841
Even though I may be like this...

672
00:50:24,842 --> 00:50:30,184
A little while ago...
I played the role of a King.

673
00:50:30,762 --> 00:50:33,060
But this is what I'm doing now...

674
00:50:33,270 --> 00:50:36,783
[What to do...

[All we see in front of us now...
Is a nervous...and good looking young man!]

Even if they were to see me...
They can't even see my name tag.

677
00:50:46,256 --> 00:50:49,976
And I can...like this...

678

[Turning off the light for now
because voices can be heard outside]

679
00:51:02,138 --> 00:51:05,121
It doesn't matter to me
whose name gets torn off.

680
00:51:05,980 --> 00:51:08,610
Because I did it by myself the last time.

681
00:51:11,641 --> 00:51:15,676
[Oh!  Soo Hyun's in there!]

682

[If he's discovered already,
then everything is over!]

683
00:51:43,845 --> 00:51:47,367
[Was the door somehow locked?]

684
00:51:49,448 --> 00:51:53,710
[Locked the door right away earlier
when it seemed like someone was approaching]

685
00:51:54,803 --> 00:52:00,260
[Thank goodness...
If it hadn't been locked, game over!]

[Soo Hyun averts a crisis
with an instantaneous wit]

687

I'm so scared...

699
00:53:19,964 --> 00:53:22,398
This is a variety show...
A variety show...

700
00:53:23,545 --> 00:53:27,023
[Lately feeling terrorized...
Just what is his fate?]

[Discovers a box with 'R' sticker!]

710
00:54:01,592 --> 00:54:04,368
[What kind of luck is this
during shopping?]

711

[If you combine the words written
on the bouillon

712
00:54:14,449 --> 00:54:18,872
you'll find out where the
final destination is!]

713
00:54:26,411 --> 00:54:28,599
I just opened it, and look at this!

714
00:54:30,239 --> 00:54:33,257
[He just randomly opened one,
and right in there...!]

[Greeting Ha Ha warmly too]

721
00:55:03,014 --> 00:55:08,361
I've been watching your show...
And I'm so mad it's about to drive me crazy!

722
00:55:08,361 --> 00:55:09,666
Thank you...
For watching Running Man on your busy schedule.

723
00:55:09,667 --> 00:55:12,457
I mean, I guess you're watching
The Chaser, not Running Man.

724
00:55:12,458 --> 00:55:16,111
But the feeling of it is somewhat similar.
We're always chasing each other too.

725
00:55:16,112 --> 00:55:21,060
[But... He could tell Ha Ha about
seeing Soo Hyun earlier...?]

been great to have seen their expression]
