for the next opportunity]

[White Team moving in
before the Easy Brothers]

1314
01:18:24,470 --> 01:18:26,990

-'I got it, I got it!'
-See?  I did get it!

1433

Then what did it mean
when you said you got it?

1434
01:26:17,240 --> 01:26:18,900
If you got it, then why is there another one?

1435
01:26:18,900 --> 01:26:21,020
If I said, 'I got it, I got it',
does it mean that I tore 2 off?

Wow... She's something else.
'Let me try tearing it off too!'

1441
