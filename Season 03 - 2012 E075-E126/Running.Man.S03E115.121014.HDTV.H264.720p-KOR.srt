Since this is how it is, we need to get rid
of both their bells at the first mission.

88

What did you say?

89
00:06:18,372 --> 00:06:21,634

00:07:05,707 --> 00:07:09,037
- We may have to get rid of them first.
- Don't get rid of us, Jae Suk.

101

107
00:07:31,683 --> 00:07:35,073
- We're just their shadows, right?
- Of course, we're nothing but shadows.

108
00:07:35,074 --> 00:07:39,590
- Just think of us as your shadows...
- And your clothes are actually black too.

Even he used to wink a lot back in the day
with his small eyes.

127
00:08:33,589 --> 00:08:36,016
I never got to wink because
I always wore those sunglasses.

[This is how... he's been temporarily
transformed into a Marine Police Officer!]

1016

[Oh... not bad!]

1017
01:10:52,204 --> 01:10:57,098
[In search of an 'R' marked box in uniform!]

1018
01:11:01,898 --> 01:11:06,771
[Meanwhile, a more enthusiastic Chang Min
after the capture also on the move!]

1019
01:11:07,922 --> 01:11:09,884
I'll just go through for a moment.

1020
01:11:11,992 --> 01:11:15,772
[As if his chasing instinct has been
awakened from its slumber...]

1021
01:11:22,347 --> 01:11:25,106
[Where could the box be?]

1022
01:11:26,821 --> 01:11:31,828
[Chang Min earnestly on the chase]

1023
01:11:34,596 --> 01:11:36,826
[This isn't it either...]

1024
01:11:47,104 --> 01:11:48,564
You must be tired.

1025
01:11:48,565 --> 01:11:52,436
[It seems as though Chang Min may
do more than his share today!]

1026
01:12:02,658 --> 01:12:06,134
[At this rate,
it's impossible to go downstairs!]

1027
01:12:06,135 --> 01:12:10,677
[Racing to escape back up the stairs
without having any other choice!]

1028

1029
01:12:15,615 --> 01:12:18,854
[Of all things, running in to Ha Ha!]

1030
01:12:18,855 --> 01:12:20,578
- Ha Ha...
- You want to make a go at it?

1031
01:12:20,579 --> 01:12:24,192
[A big trouble since he can't rip off
the Chase Team's nametag!]

1032
01:12:24,193 --> 01:12:26,679
- Who were you with?
- I'll be honest with you...

1033
01:12:26,680 --> 01:12:29,360
You're trying to run, aren't you?
Then hand someone over to me.

1034
01:12:29,361 --> 01:12:31,428
I’m too tired to go up against you right now.

1035
01:12:31,429 --> 01:12:36,111
If you go down 2 floors...
Kwang Soo is down there.

1036
01:12:36,146 --> 01:12:38,681
- Can you swear to that?
- I swear.

1037
01:12:38,682 --> 01:12:40,223
Let's go together. You lead the way.

1038
01:12:41,162 --> 01:12:43,483
How can I go with my back to you right now?

1039
01:12:43,484 --> 01:12:46,752
Then... you can come behind me.

1040
01:12:46,753 --> 01:12:49,479
If you run from me,
I'll chase you to the ends of the earth.

[Yoo-ruce Willis bluffing his way
into buying himself some time?]

many boxes piled in a room...]

1045

[Could there be a box
with the 'R' mark in here?]

1046

[Finally discovers a box with the 'R' mark!]

1047
01:13:19,667 --> 01:13:21,441

[Someone from the Chase Team
is about to get ousted!]

1050

[Just whose name is inside the bell?]

1051
01:13:56,301 --> 01:14:01,219

[In that case...]

1053
01:14:08,633 --> 01:14:11,976
[Strongest Chang Min's name
was inside the bell!]

1054
01:14:13,289 --> 01:14:18,149

partner being ousted so unexpectedly]

1056

[It wasn't even someone else...]

1059
01:14:32,824 --> 01:14:34,249
Kwang Soo did?

1060

[A formal apology to the DBSK fan club]

1062
01:14:40,715 --> 01:14:45,808

[Meanwhile, Jae Suk who bluffed
about taking Ha Ha to Kwang Soo...]

1064
01:15:00,163 --> 01:15:01,309
Bring him out here to me.

1065
01:15:01,310 --> 01:15:03,722
- Okay, I got it!
- Hurry.

1066
01:15:03,723 --> 01:15:05,861
- Do I really have to betray him?
- Quickly.

1067
01:15:05,862 --> 01:15:07,726
You promised.

1068

Why are you running around so hard?
Your face is sweating so much...

1095
01:17:23,789 --> 01:17:26,681
I caught Yoon Ho first...

1096
01:17:26,682 --> 01:17:30,053
- It got your spirits up, didn’t it?
- It really got my spirit up...

- What are you doing?
- Kwang Soo!

1101

Kwang Soo, we can still tell that it's you.

1102

- Look. He's calling someone.
- Jong Kook, Kwang Soo's in a police uniform.

1110
01:18:17,211 --> 01:18:19,359
Yes, Jong Kook. In a police uniform.

1111

- What are you doing?
- He's in a blue police uniform.

smiling, someone's in here?
