1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,880
<i>- I'll solve the riddle.
- The time has stopped.</i>

2
00:00:02,881 --> 00:00:05,824
<i>[Pass the mission to earn the hint.]</i>

3
00:00:05,825 --> 00:00:08,479
<i>[Because the answer is contained within.]</i>

4
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:12,789
<i>[Think!]</i>

5
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:16,299
<i>[Carry it out!]</i>

6
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:18,957
<i>[The secret of the riddle shedding its
veil more and more they go!]</i>

7
00:00:18,958 --> 00:00:20,724
<i>[The riddle race]</i>

8
00:00:20,909 --> 00:00:23,657
[6 a.m.]

9
00:00:25,085 --> 00:00:29,039
[All the Running Men are asleep from
exhaustion from having seen their futures.]

10
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:33,795
[In the silence of the morning...]

11
00:00:37,044 --> 00:00:40,511
[Appearance of ghosts?]

12
00:00:40,512 --> 00:00:45,501
[Just who are these ghostly women?]

13
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:57,759
[Jae Suk deep in thought?]

14
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:15,006
[Jae Suk...]

15
00:01:19,649 --> 00:01:22,867
[Another being behind him?]

16
00:01:24,011 --> 00:01:28,333
[In this moment where he wishes that
he could have the use of Future Ddak-ji...]

17
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:42,106
[Back tumbling onto his bed
first thing in the morning.]

18
00:01:47,967 --> 00:01:49,871
<i>- Hello.
- Hello.</i>

19
00:01:54,455 --> 00:01:58,988
[Suzy and Yubin,
shining Gwangju born stars.]

20
00:01:59,962 --> 00:02:04,038
[Suzy and Yubin who've come back to their
hometown to greet Running Man at 5 a.m.]

21
00:02:05,867 --> 00:02:10,376
Scare all the scaredy cat Running Man members
awake and gather them up in the front lobby.

22
00:02:13,721 --> 00:02:15,543
Song Ji Hyo...

23
00:02:15,544 --> 00:02:17,050
What is this? Suzy?

24
00:02:17,841 --> 00:02:19,082
And Yubin...

25
00:02:20,905 --> 00:02:23,996
- We scared you, didn't we?
- Yeah, I was totally startled.

26
00:02:23,996 --> 00:02:25,245
[Jae Suk with 10 years taken off of his life.]

27
00:02:25,786 --> 00:02:28,933
[But anyways...]

28
00:02:28,933 --> 00:02:34,762
[Opening up the curtains for the sudden
visit from his lady guests?]

29
00:02:34,762 --> 00:02:36,602
It's so dark in here.

30
00:02:36,603 --> 00:02:38,561
You could've just turned the light on...

31
00:02:40,216 --> 00:02:43,903
<i>Seriously... you weren't too happy about
the guests we had yesterday, but today...</i>

32
00:02:44,735 --> 00:02:47,049
[An expression that's
hard for him to keep hidden.]

33
00:02:51,471 --> 00:02:53,874
- Have you had your breakfast?
- No.

34
00:02:55,135 --> 00:02:56,729
[Seriously!]

35
00:02:58,223 --> 00:03:02,995
[Shall we get on with scaring
some of the other members awake?]

36
00:03:06,859 --> 00:03:09,731
[Putting on their disguise
in front of the door...]

37
00:03:15,021 --> 00:03:16,689
[Come in, come in.]

38
00:03:20,807 --> 00:03:23,460
[Deep asleep scaredy cat, Haroro.]

39
00:03:26,596 --> 00:03:30,766
<i>Ha Ha...</i>

40
00:03:30,767 --> 00:03:34,233
<i>Wake up...</i>

41
00:03:48,932 --> 00:03:52,838
[As soon as he's scared awake, he's
worried about the way he's dressed.]

42
00:03:56,326 --> 00:03:57,698
It's okay, we all know that you're
only in your underwear right now.

43
00:03:57,699 --> 00:03:59,491
Ha Ha...

44
00:04:00,046 --> 00:04:02,521
Get up... you know who this is?

45
00:04:02,522 --> 00:04:04,561
[Who is it?]

46
00:04:06,923 --> 00:04:08,805
- Hello.
- Hello.

47
00:04:13,689 --> 00:04:16,896
[Even more shocking than seeing
ghosts come to life.]

48
00:04:16,897 --> 00:04:18,503
He's more surprised to see Yubin and Suzy
here than seeing ghosts.

49
00:04:21,661 --> 00:04:24,402
[Now that we think about it...]

50
00:04:25,222 --> 00:04:30,625
[His mate, Suzy that he's been
longing for.]

51
00:04:32,892 --> 00:04:36,578
[This is... a miraculous morning.]

52
00:04:36,579 --> 00:04:41,296
I really am... really glad to see you.

53
00:04:44,133 --> 00:04:46,575
You look way too happy right now.

54
00:04:46,576 --> 00:04:48,436
[A happy grin on his face
to start off the morning.]

55
00:04:48,437 --> 00:04:50,395
- Hurry up and get up.
- Where are your pants?

56
00:04:50,396 --> 00:04:53,576
[Need to get dressed quickly to
go and wake up the next person.]

57
00:04:53,577 --> 00:04:55,292
Jae Suk! Come on, don't do it!

58
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,806
[Older brother Hyuk
getting his little brother dressed.]

59
00:05:02,631 --> 00:05:05,114
Jae Suk... Jae Suk...

60
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:07,824
Here, I'll hold this up.

61
00:05:07,825 --> 00:05:11,748
- I'll take care of it.
- His underwear is showing right now.

62
00:05:11,749 --> 00:05:13,417
[Just what is being done to him
in front of Suzy right now...]

63
00:05:13,418 --> 00:05:15,031
Hey...

64
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,296
You're all dressed now.
Yubin, you can turn around now.

65
00:05:19,154 --> 00:05:21,672
[Oh my...]

66
00:05:21,672 --> 00:05:24,200
[Are those 'Mom pants'?]

67
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:29,127
They're not interested in your underwear.

68
00:05:29,128 --> 00:05:30,491
Jae Suk...

69
00:05:31,158 --> 00:05:33,310
High waisted pants...

70
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:36,771
You're not that important,
so hurry up and get up.

71
00:05:36,772 --> 00:05:38,007
I'm not this type of a person!

72
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:43,130
[The next person to be awoken is...]

73
00:05:45,953 --> 00:05:48,659
[Peacefully asleep Ji Sung.]

74
00:05:49,773 --> 00:05:51,297
[Ready]

75
00:06:01,969 --> 00:06:05,601
[A surprise visit to chase
all his sleep away!]

76
00:06:08,261 --> 00:06:10,737
- Ji Sung...
- I knew something like this was coming.

77
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:16,286
- Ji Sung...
- Ji Sung, you're so cute.

78
00:06:18,355 --> 00:06:20,649
- This is Suzy and Yubin...
- Hello.

79
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:22,119
What the heck is this?

80
00:06:23,483 --> 00:06:25,049
What the heck?

81
00:06:27,252 --> 00:06:30,652
- Look at how shocked he is right now.
- Look at how much you brightened up.

82
00:06:30,653 --> 00:06:34,258
I thought it was you and Jong Kook with
the wigs over your faces.

83
00:06:34,259 --> 00:06:36,209
[Immediately brightening up?]

84
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:37,885
It's so nice to see you.

85
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:41,904
This is pretty nice.

86
00:06:41,905 --> 00:06:43,863
The smile is coming off your face.

87
00:06:50,223 --> 00:06:54,206
[Putting on his gentle face and demeanor.]

88
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:55,414
<i>Are you shooting
a commercial or something?</i>

89
00:06:56,677 --> 00:07:00,058
This is the first time I've seen Ji Sung
using both his hands to wave and greet.

90
00:07:00,059 --> 00:07:01,305
[Welcoming them with a double wave.]

91
00:07:05,155 --> 00:07:07,521
You look like you're having
way too much fun with this.

92
00:07:07,522 --> 00:07:10,115
This is the most fun I've ever had.

93
00:07:13,677 --> 00:07:16,905
[This time, it's deeply asleep Jin Hee.]

94
00:07:31,065 --> 00:07:33,006
Sorry, I was wrong.

95
00:07:34,709 --> 00:07:37,381
- I'm sorry.
- What are you looking for?

96
00:07:51,527 --> 00:07:54,164
[Ah... what do I do about this?]

97
00:07:58,464 --> 00:08:01,647
[Did he really think they were ghosts?]

98
00:08:03,856 --> 00:08:06,708
[But it's impossible to fix this situation.]

99
00:08:06,709 --> 00:08:08,475
I'm sorry.

100
00:08:11,829 --> 00:08:14,491
[Scaring the daylights out of him.]

101
00:08:17,395 --> 00:08:19,229
[I'm so scared...]

102
00:08:20,967 --> 00:08:22,998
[It's the sleeping Tiger's turn.]

103
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:31,192
[Not even startled by it,
but gets up from all the noise.]

104
00:08:37,394 --> 00:08:38,817
What the heck is this? What's going on?

105
00:08:40,264 --> 00:08:42,095
You totally startled me!

106
00:08:42,096 --> 00:08:46,221
<i>Gary... just calm down and take a look.</i>

107
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:50,508
- It's Ji Hyo, right?
- Yeah...

108
00:08:50,509 --> 00:08:53,063
- Hello.
- Hello.

109
00:08:53,064 --> 00:08:54,930
<i>- Hello.
- Hello.</i>

110
00:09:02,308 --> 00:09:05,574
- Don't do it... don't do it...
- Gary...

111
00:09:05,575 --> 00:09:08,217
<i>Out of everyone so far,
you look the worst.</i>

112
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:12,154
[My morning look that I don't want
to show to the ladies.]

113
00:09:12,155 --> 00:09:15,103
Yubin and Suzy are here right now.

114
00:09:15,104 --> 00:09:17,044
What the heck is this?

115
00:09:17,045 --> 00:09:19,129
It's a wet towel so the room
doesn't get too dry.

116
00:09:22,498 --> 00:09:27,297
[Sensitive Gary with his wet towel...]

117
00:09:27,297 --> 00:09:29,474
It's something I need to do
as a singer.

118
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:32,009
As a singer...

119
00:09:32,523 --> 00:09:34,596
[Completes waking up the whole team.]

120
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:40,153
[A much different morning the one before.]

121
00:09:41,117 --> 00:09:43,356
- Have you been well?
- Yes.

122
00:09:45,104 --> 00:09:47,259
[That's enough now...]

123
00:09:47,834 --> 00:09:52,560
This is what you wanted so badly...
and now she's here.

124
00:09:52,561 --> 00:09:55,180
Why is it that I can't seem to
say anything?

125
00:09:56,048 --> 00:09:57,990
Should I just let it go this week?

126
00:09:59,633 --> 00:10:02,784
They say it's not cheating when
you're doing it front of other people.

127
00:10:02,785 --> 00:10:07,126
[His natural instinct that's been
dormant?]

128
00:10:07,127 --> 00:10:08,907
Have you been well?

129
00:10:10,551 --> 00:10:12,368
You're the most pitiful.

130
00:10:12,369 --> 00:10:14,794
- Why?
- I said, you're the most pitiful.

131
00:10:14,794 --> 00:10:16,927
Because you have less than a month left
until your wedding now.

132
00:10:18,861 --> 00:10:21,327
- It doesn't sound like you're happy about it.
- No, I'm happy.

133
00:10:21,362 --> 00:10:23,421
I am happy, but I feel really bad for you.

134
00:10:27,468 --> 00:10:30,028
[Gathering everyone up
in the lobby is now complete.]

135
00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:32,270
There will be an announcement of
the teams in a little bit.

136
00:10:32,271 --> 00:10:34,630
I'm sure everyone's pretty much
feeling the same way this morning.

137
00:10:34,631 --> 00:10:40,154
It's the same as being in hell if you're not
teamed up with Suzy and Yubin today.

138
00:10:40,155 --> 00:10:43,250
<i>What about you, Ji Hyo?
Does it feel bad to hear him say that?</i>

139
00:10:43,251 --> 00:10:47,007
- It's okay. I'm like family.
- You have me, you fool.

140
00:10:50,292 --> 00:10:52,420
Kang Gary can look so ugly.

141
00:10:57,494 --> 00:11:00,850
- I will announce the teams.
- Okay.

142
00:11:02,562 --> 00:11:04,731
[Fast forwarding to the future
after the teams have been announced.]

143
00:11:07,886 --> 00:11:09,569
[Grumpy?]

144
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:13,626
[Celebrating?]

145
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:20,168
[A result that can be known
with a single glance.]

146
00:11:23,926 --> 00:11:27,557
[The left of the lobby where
the celebration is going on.]

147
00:11:27,557 --> 00:11:30,502
[Right of the lobby in solemn mood.]

148
00:11:33,796 --> 00:11:35,110
Chang Ui...

149
00:11:37,935 --> 00:11:40,415
You seriously have no luck, do you?

150
00:11:40,416 --> 00:11:42,486
[For some reason, situation like this
seems fitting for him...]

151
00:11:47,382 --> 00:11:50,366
<i>Okay, today's race is, 'The Riddle Race'.</i>

152
00:11:50,367 --> 00:11:53,727
 [The riddle race!]

153
00:11:53,728 --> 00:11:58,392
<i>Today is a race to solve the
ultimate riddle.</i>

154
00:11:58,393 --> 00:12:00,231
[Solve the ultimate riddle!]

155
00:12:00,231 --> 00:12:05,449
[Complete the various missions
throughout Gwangju...]

156
00:12:05,449 --> 00:12:10,444
[Earn clues to solving the riddles
by succeeding the missions!]

157
00:12:10,444 --> 00:12:14,141
[If you gather the clues and solve the riddle
at the final location, then you win!]

158
00:12:18,455 --> 00:12:20,505
[Riddle Race - Start!]

159
00:12:20,506 --> 00:12:23,058
What is the bag you have there?

160
00:12:23,059 --> 00:12:25,615
My Mother packed up some
things for us.

161
00:12:25,615 --> 00:12:27,450
- What?
- What did she pack up for us?

162
00:12:27,451 --> 00:12:29,757
[A bag full of snacks that Yubin's Mother
packed up for the members.]

163
00:12:29,758 --> 00:12:34,029
[Snacks packed up with Mother's love!]

164
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:35,886
Seriously?

165
00:12:37,185 --> 00:12:38,797
Thank you.

166
00:12:38,798 --> 00:12:43,161
[Go to the Town Hall in Gwangju,
and find the Running Man landmark.]

167
00:12:43,806 --> 00:12:48,381
[A sunshiny morning in Gwangju.]

168
00:12:48,382 --> 00:12:49,530
- Are you tired?
- No, not at all.

169
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:51,534
- What about you, Gary? Are you tired?
- No, I'm not.

170
00:12:51,535 --> 00:12:54,516
The moment I saw Yubin,
all my fatigue melted away.

171
00:12:54,517 --> 00:12:57,415
- I really like Running Man.
- Really?

172
00:12:57,416 --> 00:13:00,173
I've been watching it
from the very first episode.

173
00:13:00,174 --> 00:13:01,933
That's when I was really ugly.

174
00:13:03,617 --> 00:13:07,516
[The past days of calm Gary's expression
that used to be the center of visual shots.]

175
00:13:15,513 --> 00:13:18,647
- Being with Suzy...
- A day with Suzy...

176
00:13:18,648 --> 00:13:21,672
- Suzy...
- Is the best!

177
00:13:24,113 --> 00:13:25,988
I want out of here!

178
00:13:27,763 --> 00:13:31,306
It's been awhile since we've seen Suzy
looking embarrassed like that.

179
00:13:31,307 --> 00:13:33,800
It would be so nice if everyone in the world
would shout that out loud with us.

180
00:13:33,801 --> 00:13:36,078
I bet if we asked,
all the viewers will shout it out with us.

181
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:37,736
- With the viewers...
- Okay, get ready.

182
00:13:37,737 --> 00:13:40,508
- Being with Suzy...
- A day with Suzy...

183
00:13:40,509 --> 00:13:43,880
- Suzy...
- Is the best!

184
00:13:43,881 --> 00:13:46,684
There's talk that Jin Hee tends to
joke around a bit...

185
00:13:46,685 --> 00:13:48,688
[Bingo!]

186
00:13:48,689 --> 00:13:51,246
- He used to be shy around new people...
- Yeah, he used to be like that...

187
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:53,343
[Who is?]

188
00:14:01,719 --> 00:14:06,303
[Thanks to Suzy,
starting off to an enjoyable morning.]

189
00:14:06,304 --> 00:14:08,610
Normally, this is the worst time of the day,
right after you get out of bed.

190
00:14:08,611 --> 00:14:11,308
- I'm usually pretty groggy...
- Yeah, and annoyed easily.

191
00:14:12,404 --> 00:14:14,156
I wish the time would stop right now.

192
00:14:15,105 --> 00:14:17,769
Don't misunderstand this, okay?

193
00:14:19,324 --> 00:14:21,350
[What the heck?]

194
00:14:22,634 --> 00:14:24,574
Go Eun, I'm sorry!

195
00:14:26,808 --> 00:14:29,512
But it's okay, it's Suzy!

196
00:14:33,069 --> 00:14:35,861
- That team is already here!
- Yeah, all the others are already here.

197
00:14:38,893 --> 00:14:41,013
[Gwangju Town Hall]

198
00:14:41,014 --> 00:14:43,241
- Being with Suzy...
- A day with Suzy...

199
00:14:43,241 --> 00:14:45,832
- Suzy...
- Is the best!

200
00:14:51,315 --> 00:14:53,244
This is the first time I've ever seen
Jin Hee smiling so big like that.

201
00:14:55,474 --> 00:14:57,381
Why don't you just go on being the MC?

202
00:14:58,846 --> 00:15:00,980
- None of you had breakfast yet, have you?
- No!

203
00:15:00,981 --> 00:15:03,628
- I'm hungry.
- Actually, we had our breakfast.

204
00:15:03,629 --> 00:15:06,286
Yubin packed up a bag of snack for us,
so we've already enjoyed ours.

205
00:15:06,287 --> 00:15:09,433
- And we're full from Suzy's love.
- Yes.

206
00:15:09,433 --> 00:15:11,352
<i>Do you want to fill up on
some insults?</i>

207
00:15:12,183 --> 00:15:14,461
<i>We'll now have our morning breakfast
mission.</i>

208
00:15:14,462 --> 00:15:18,530
<i>Just to make it more delicious,
we'll have a morning workout.</i>

209
00:15:18,531 --> 00:15:24,419
<i>The name of the first topic is,
'The Queen's morning workout'.</i>

210
00:15:25,145 --> 00:15:28,151
[A relay race while
giving the Queen a piggy back ride.]

211
00:15:28,151 --> 00:15:30,435
[Complete it within allotted time,
and you'll pass the race!]

212
00:15:30,435 --> 00:15:32,793
No problem.
I have experience in this already.

213
00:15:32,794 --> 00:15:35,589
- Since Yubin is so light...
- Of course, this isn't even a race.

214
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:38,825
<i>Do you all see the Start flag
behind you?</i>

215
00:15:38,826 --> 00:15:41,414
<i>The race will start
when that button is pressed.</i>

216
00:15:41,415 --> 00:15:43,622
<i>Everyone will start off at the same time
after the button is pressed</i>

217
00:15:43,623 --> 00:15:47,376
<i>and you have to go a full round
outside of the yellow boxes</i>

218
00:15:47,377 --> 00:15:50,733
<i>and come back to the finish line and press
the button again, and it'll all be timed.</i>

219
00:15:50,734 --> 00:15:55,658
<i>But... while your Queen is on your back
if you drop her along the way</i>

220
00:15:55,659 --> 00:15:56,764
<i>then you will be disqualified right away.</i>

221
00:15:56,764 --> 00:16:01,797
<i>And sooner you complete the race,
better clue you will gain to solve the riddle.</i>

222
00:16:03,159 --> 00:16:07,153
[Coach Kook starts his lesson plan.]

223
00:16:07,154 --> 00:16:09,965
And if you hand her off to me there,
I will come and finish the race.

224
00:16:09,966 --> 00:16:10,982
Over here, over here...

225
00:16:10,982 --> 00:16:13,234
You start over here
and run down to that point.

226
00:16:13,234 --> 00:16:16,626
No, over there and there...
why aren't you guys getting this?

227
00:16:16,627 --> 00:16:19,508
No, over there and there...
why aren't you guys getting this?

228
00:16:19,509 --> 00:16:21,418
[Screaming Coach Kook]

229
00:16:21,419 --> 00:16:23,040
See? There are three points out there!

230
00:16:23,041 --> 00:16:24,670
Why are you being so sensitive?
This is a great day!

231
00:16:24,671 --> 00:16:26,702
Come here and take him away!

232
00:16:26,703 --> 00:16:30,555
[Ji Hyo's team is feeling as though they're in
hellish training camp, rather than a fun race.]

233
00:16:31,267 --> 00:16:33,226
You think you're a coach for
some sort of a national team?

234
00:16:36,065 --> 00:16:37,724
I seriously need to start exercising my legs.

235
00:16:39,124 --> 00:16:40,695
Since I barely workout...

236
00:16:42,948 --> 00:16:45,542
[Jae Suk secretly hiding behind
Big-nosed brother!]

237
00:16:45,542 --> 00:16:48,412
Ready... set...

238
00:16:53,255 --> 00:16:54,847
Hey, be more careful...

239
00:16:59,408 --> 00:17:01,684
Hey! You should wait until I'm ready.

240
00:17:01,685 --> 00:17:03,652
You should've waited until I'm ready.

241
00:17:05,156 --> 00:17:06,990
Faster! Faster!

242
00:17:09,492 --> 00:17:13,038
[Big-nosed brother hurrying along with
a different team member, Jae Suk.]

243
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:29,507
[Kicking out of rage?]

244
00:17:39,279 --> 00:17:41,892
[Big-nosed brother having wasted
his energy for nothing.]

245
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:48,850
I... I was thinking that Ji Hyo's thighs...

246
00:17:51,888 --> 00:17:53,986
I was thinking that she must have
a very sturdy lower body...

247
00:17:58,864 --> 00:18:01,146
[Ji Hyo's team's
authentic attempt at the challenge.]

248
00:18:06,515 --> 00:18:08,664
<i>- He's quick...
- He's really fast!</i>

249
00:18:12,538 --> 00:18:14,284
He just threw her.

250
00:18:15,519 --> 00:18:18,238
[The weak link Chang Ui's run.]

251
00:18:24,636 --> 00:18:26,393
I think they might do it... they might win.

252
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:41,415
[Ah... what a waste...]

253
00:18:44,746 --> 00:18:48,048
[A big laughter from weak link
Chang Ui's tumble on the grass.]

254
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:54,590
<i>He's just like me...</i>

255
00:18:55,928 --> 00:18:57,976
- What the heck is his deal?
- What are you doing?

256
00:18:59,869 --> 00:19:01,546
Chun Hee, are you watching this?

257
00:19:05,278 --> 00:19:07,406
I thought we were going to win this.

258
00:19:07,407 --> 00:19:09,087
- Pil!
- Chok! Cross!

259
00:19:09,088 --> 00:19:11,980
Kwang Soo... Kwang Soo...

260
00:19:11,981 --> 00:19:15,734
[They do say that you start to
act like your friends...]

261
00:19:16,711 --> 00:19:18,864
<i>I had a feeling that he was
going to fall.</i>

262
00:19:18,865 --> 00:19:20,974
Kwang Soo's looking really nervous
right now because of Chang Ui.

263
00:19:20,975 --> 00:19:24,256
[Worrying he may get his spot taken away after
having worked on it for two and a half years.]

264
00:19:25,951 --> 00:19:27,888
-Fighting!
- Fighting!

265
00:19:30,967 --> 00:19:33,541
[The Giraffe's tall back.]

266
00:19:33,874 --> 00:19:35,545
She's climbing on there like a horse.

267
00:19:35,546 --> 00:19:37,868
I thought she was getting on
top of a horse.

268
00:19:37,869 --> 00:19:40,043
[A camel riding experience in Gwangju.]

269
00:19:40,044 --> 00:19:41,309
I'm ready!

270
00:19:49,071 --> 00:19:51,435
[Their plan? To run alongside together?]

271
00:19:51,436 --> 00:19:53,859
[Nice! Nice!]

272
00:19:57,975 --> 00:20:00,449
Arm! My arm!

while passing her off to Ha Ha.]

[Fail...]

275
00:20:11,008 --> 00:20:12,965
- My arm was caught...
- I want to give her a piggy back ride!

276
00:20:15,337 --> 00:20:18,931
But it wasn't bad.
Going from tall to short was a good move.

277
00:20:18,932 --> 00:20:20,860
Doing it in reverse wouldn't have worked.

278
00:20:22,865 --> 00:20:26,540
[Wait...]

279
00:20:27,701 --> 00:20:29,751
Jae Suk, how about this plan?

280
00:20:29,752 --> 00:20:35,521
The last relay person can stand right
next to the buzzer and hit it right away.

281
00:20:35,522 --> 00:20:38,322
[The third person lying in wait
right next to the buzzer?]

282
00:20:39,035 --> 00:20:42,019
[Since it takes time to pass off the Queen...]

283
00:20:42,019 --> 00:20:44,495
[Proposing that the last person to wait right
in front of the buzzer to make the pass to!]

284
00:20:44,495 --> 00:20:46,066
Why don't we try as you suggest?

285
00:20:46,901 --> 00:20:48,374
<i>I'll stand right here.</i>

286
00:20:48,375 --> 00:20:50,101
Right here... I'll just stand here.

287
00:20:54,127 --> 00:20:56,107
[Yubin's team- Start!]

288
00:20:59,585 --> 00:21:02,199
[Even though the runners have to run
further because of the plan...]

289
00:21:02,199 --> 00:21:05,399
[It's still a great plan if you think
about the time it saves.]

290
00:21:10,599 --> 00:21:13,093
[Handing off to second runner, Jae Suk.]

291
00:21:15,119 --> 00:21:17,615
[It's still not even 12 seconds
on the clock!]

292
00:21:21,189 --> 00:21:22,647
Jae Suk, run!

293
00:21:23,417 --> 00:21:25,237
I think they're going to press the button
as they make the pass at the end.

294
00:21:25,238 --> 00:21:27,864
- Almost there, almost there...
- He's really fast!

295
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,199
[At this speed...]

296
00:21:32,199 --> 00:21:35,141
[Jae Suk heading to the finish line!]

297
00:21:36,099 --> 00:21:41,485
[If he can pass her off to Ji Sung,
and the button is pressed!]

298
00:21:54,285 --> 00:21:57,641
[Not able to pass her off correctly
at the very last minute.]

299
00:21:58,963 --> 00:22:01,677
[However, it's a great record!]

300
00:22:01,678 --> 00:22:04,483
- Wow... look at the time.
- That's a good plan.

301
00:22:04,484 --> 00:22:05,565
That's a great plan.

302
00:22:05,566 --> 00:22:08,487
There are no specific methods, right?
She just needs to be on our backs?

303
00:22:08,488 --> 00:22:09,493
Okay.

304
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:16,055
[Placing the last runner, Big-nosed brother
right in front of the buzzer.]

305
00:22:16,055 --> 00:22:18,385
Widen out your legs a bit more,
and stick out your behind more.

306
00:22:18,386 --> 00:22:20,242
This is a good plan.
We can do it this time.

307
00:22:21,313 --> 00:22:24,485
[Team Ji Hyo's attempt.]

308
00:22:25,851 --> 00:22:27,816
Ready...

309
00:22:31,575 --> 00:22:33,325
<i>Why is he so wobbly?</i>

310
00:22:34,429 --> 00:22:37,598
[Weakling Chang Ui, turning his first corner.]

311
00:22:37,598 --> 00:22:41,968
[Ace Ji Hyo's shocking jump pass!]

312
00:22:41,969 --> 00:22:43,713
<i>- That was quick.
- That was fast!</i>

313
00:22:43,714 --> 00:22:45,821
<i>That's great! We're at 10 seconds!</i>

314
00:22:46,748 --> 00:22:48,398
That's great! We're at 10 seconds!

315
00:22:49,263 --> 00:22:50,792
Hurry!

316
00:22:50,793 --> 00:22:53,960
[Down to the finish line!]

317
00:22:55,053 --> 00:23:00,243
[Team Ji Hyo may win this!]

318
00:23:00,243 --> 00:23:04,304
[As long as she can be passed off to
the last runner, Big-nosed brother!]

319
00:23:11,966 --> 00:23:15,596
[Ah... he just pressed the button...]

320
00:23:18,493 --> 00:23:21,195
[That was within 20 seconds...]

321
00:23:21,196 --> 00:23:23,477
No, she has to be on your back.
On your back.

322
00:23:23,478 --> 00:23:26,033
- Why don't we give it a try?
- Okay.

323
00:23:26,033 --> 00:23:28,490
Right here... right in front of it.

324
00:23:29,043 --> 00:23:32,088
[This time, the plan is to pass her off
the moment they start the race.]

325
00:23:39,236 --> 00:23:41,914
[Taking a little longer
to make the first pass.]

326
00:23:45,166 --> 00:23:47,901
[Now rushing to the third runner.]

327
00:23:51,629 --> 00:23:54,655
[A jumping pass to the third runner, Gary!]

328
00:23:59,062 --> 00:24:01,105
My arm is caught!

329
00:24:01,926 --> 00:24:04,617
[Jae Suk having to run alongside them.]

330
00:24:08,374 --> 00:24:11,980
[Fail...]

331
00:24:12,869 --> 00:24:17,269
[If only his arm hadn't been caught,
it could've been possible...]

332
00:24:19,394 --> 00:24:21,950
- Then I'll wait like this.
- Okay, that's good.

333
00:24:21,951 --> 00:24:24,963
Then who's back am I going to
get on first?

334
00:24:24,964 --> 00:24:26,707
Come here. Climb on my back here.

that would be easiest to pass her off.]

337

[The Giraffe's run... and Jin Hee too?]

339
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:59,811
Faster! Move faster!

340
00:25:00,686 --> 00:25:02,372
Hey, Jin Hee, why are you running?

341
00:25:03,741 --> 00:25:06,244
[Coach Ji encouraging on the Giraffe.]

342
00:25:09,432 --> 00:25:11,143
No, that's not going to work.
That's too difficult.

343
00:25:14,287 --> 00:25:16,520
Nice! Nice!

[I came up with that plan...]

352

[Team Suzy is the first
to pass the morning mission!]

353
00:26:08,203 --> 00:26:10,515
- Being with Suzy...
- A day with Suzy...

354
00:26:10,515 --> 00:26:13,910
- Suzy is...
- The best!

355

and figure out the answer.</i>

358

- Do we have to choose?
- Yes.

359
00:26:29,071 --> 00:26:31,809
Should we go with gold?
It looks like gold, silver and bronze.

360
00:26:33,381 --> 00:26:34,558
Suzy, you pick.

361
00:26:36,044 --> 00:26:38,353
[Team Suzy chooses the silver envelope.]

362

[Since it's plus one, they're
moving onto Dduk-galbi restaurant!]

364
00:26:57,216 --> 00:26:58,818

365
00:26:58,819 --> 00:27:00,638
[Team Ji Hyo is also going with the
method Team Suzy used.]

366

[Mr. Capable passes her onto himself
right away and gets on the way!]

367

[Just flinging her onto his back?]

368
00:27:12,195 --> 00:27:16,092
[Incredible strength!]

369
00:27:18,967 --> 00:27:20,807
[And Ji Hyo for sticking onto him
is pretty incredible too!]

370

Look at them...

371
00:27:22,014 --> 00:27:23,799
How can he run with a person
hanging off of him like that?

372
00:27:26,624 --> 00:27:28,243
[Barely 12 seconds in!]

373
00:27:32,364 --> 00:27:34,645
[The last runner, Chang Ui,
who's standing in front of the buzzer!]

374
00:27:43,808 --> 00:27:47,080
[18.04 seconds. A success!]

375
00:27:47,081 --> 00:27:48,736
Are you okay?

376

This is the first time I've ever
seen him collapse like this.

378
00:27:52,574 --> 00:27:56,214
Jong Kook... you really were amazing!

379

[Being handed their clue
to the ultimate riddle.]

381

What is this?
Is this gold and bronze?

382
00:28:07,639 --> 00:28:09,399
I bet there was silver too,
looking at how the colors are.

383
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,256
- Why don't we go with the gold?
- Okay, let's take the gold.

- Suzy is...
- The best!

389

- Let me see the hint card.

390

[Inside the silver envelope is...]

391

[Just a zero?]

- So what is this riddle?
- We have to solve it.

393
00:28:49,253 --> 00:28:53,394
I wonder if it's like
zero minus one,  plus one?

394
00:28:53,395 --> 00:28:55,502
Zero...

395
00:28:56,066 --> 00:28:59,675
[With merely one hint,
it seems impossible to...]

396

solve the riddle...

[Are there advantages or disadvantages
to the color of the envelopes?]

399
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:14,642
What does the number two mean?

400
00:29:14,643 --> 00:29:17,596
Don't you think it would have
something to do with Gwangju?

401
00:29:18,239 --> 00:29:20,539
[A riddle that has something to do
with Gwangju?]

402
00:29:22,286 --> 00:29:25,459
For example, something to do with
2002 World Cup?

403
00:29:28,173 --> 00:29:33,586
[What could these mean?]

404
00:29:37,843 --> 00:29:41,024
- They're all Dduk-galbi restaurants.
- This place is so big.

405

- 'O'!
- Without a doubt, it's from Argentina!

- Two time two is four?

- Four?
- Could it be something like that?

What could this mean?

578

- Does it mean that two is greater?
- Two is greater...

579
00:40:38,882 --> 00:40:40,761

00:57:31,481 --> 00:57:35,613
[Still not a clue as to what it is...]

839
00:57:36,565 --> 00:57:39,465
Since the riddle is supposed to be
solved at the end...

840
00:57:39,466 --> 00:57:44,233
I think solving the riddle is...

841
00:57:46,282 --> 00:57:48,163
<i>To be honest, I have no idea.</i>

842
00:57:48,972 --> 00:57:51,776
I'm even more confused with
this new clue.

843
00:57:51,777 --> 00:57:56,247
[The more hints they gain,
the more confusing it's getting!]

844
00:57:57,026 --> 00:58:00,122
Do you think... it could be
a name to a certain project?

845
00:58:00,912 --> 00:58:04,843
- Like a name to a piece of work?
- So we have to find what that work is?

846
00:58:06,428 --> 00:58:10,538
- Is Running Man normally this hard?
- This is how it can be at times.

847
00:58:10,539 --> 00:58:12,791
But it seems even more difficult today.

848
00:58:13,815 --> 00:58:17,948
[Just what is
the correct answer to this riddle?]

849
00:58:25,446 --> 00:58:28,196
[Team Ji Hyo arrives at the
amusement park!]

850
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:36,100
[Just what is the mission
that awaits them here?]

851
00:58:39,622 --> 00:58:41,777
[Amusement Park - Disco Step counter]

852
00:58:41,777 --> 00:58:43,353
[Get on the amusement ride with the
counter strapped to your ankle.]

853
00:58:43,353 --> 00:58:45,036
[If the total count for the team is
less than 300, you succeed the mission!]

854
00:58:46,230 --> 00:58:50,135
[Try not to move while being on
a shaky amusement ride!]

855
00:58:52,559 --> 00:58:55,811
[Team Ji Hyo getting on the ride!]

856
00:58:55,812 --> 00:58:57,858
This is going to be really hard.

857
00:58:59,650 --> 00:59:04,434
[The counter is strapped to their ankle!
If the total count is less than 300, success!]

858
00:59:04,435 --> 00:59:07,558
Press the reset button after you put it on.

859
00:59:07,559 --> 00:59:09,050
Yeah, don't press the reset button
until you have it on.

860
00:59:09,051 --> 00:59:11,534
[Have to save every last count!]

861
00:59:14,245 --> 00:59:17,517
[Starting the disco ride!]

862
00:59:19,446 --> 00:59:23,478
[The stop counter around their ankle!
Will they be able to endure not moving?]

863
00:59:23,478 --> 00:59:26,972
[Moving faster and shaking around more!]

864
00:59:26,973 --> 00:59:29,747
Lift up your leg! Hold your leg up!

865
00:59:30,595 --> 00:59:33,889
[Unlike just seeing it,
it can't be easy withstanding it...]

866
00:59:40,283 --> 00:59:43,183
[Team Suzy also arrives
at the amusement park!]

867
00:59:44,747 --> 00:59:45,966
They're already here.

868
00:59:45,967 --> 00:59:49,465
[Getting an idea of what's coming from
seeing what the other team is doing.]

869
00:59:49,466 --> 00:59:50,970
We can do it, we can do it!

870
00:59:51,893 --> 00:59:53,648
[Big-nosed brother!]

871
01:00:04,619 --> 01:00:08,347
[Ultimately, not being able to withstand it,
he ends up break dancing on the floor.]

872
01:00:09,497 --> 01:00:11,697
[Ji Hyo is clinging on...]

873
01:00:12,249 --> 01:00:14,019
[Head banging?]

874
01:00:17,357 --> 01:00:20,698
[Ah! Big-nosed brother's step counter!]

875
01:00:21,603 --> 01:00:23,550
[I'm... ruined!]

876
01:00:25,025 --> 01:00:28,396
[At least others need to stick it out!]

877
01:00:32,064 --> 01:00:35,679
[Disco ride - Stop!]

878
01:00:36,659 --> 01:00:41,173
[Will the four people's combined count
ne less than 300?]

879
01:00:41,174 --> 01:00:44,131
- 125.
- I have 125!

880
01:00:44,132 --> 01:00:45,964
[Mr. Capable's count is 125]

881
01:00:46,906 --> 01:00:51,043
[Ji Hyo's count- 142]

882
01:00:51,808 --> 01:00:55,356
[Chang Ui's count- 110]

883
01:00:56,734 --> 01:00:58,362
I have 182.

884
01:00:58,363 --> 01:01:03,925
[If 300 or less, it's a success.
Team Ji Hyo fails with 559.]

885
01:01:05,068 --> 01:01:08,100
[Confident Team Suzy's turn.]

886
01:01:08,101 --> 01:01:11,175
Sit on it... sit on your leg.

887
01:01:11,176 --> 01:01:14,697
[Coach Jin Hee. Pull up the
leg with the counter on it?]

888
01:01:14,698 --> 01:01:16,764
- Jin Hee, are you sure?
- I'm sure!

889
01:01:16,765 --> 01:01:20,169
I'm positive! If anything,
it's your right leg receiving the shock.

890
01:01:20,170 --> 01:01:22,508
<i>I'm positive! If anything,
it's your right leg receiving the shock.</i>

891
01:01:26,050 --> 01:01:28,303
[Starting the shake the moment it starts!]

892
01:01:29,377 --> 01:01:31,270
Lift up your foot! Lift up your foot!

893
01:01:33,264 --> 01:01:35,922
Lift up your foot! Lift up your foot!

894
01:01:35,923 --> 01:01:37,728
Lift up your foot!

895
01:01:42,460 --> 01:01:46,271
[No matter how much it shakes...
keep your foot off the floor!]

896
01:01:48,896 --> 01:01:52,306
[It's easier said than done...]

897
01:01:55,247 --> 01:01:56,719
[Now what in the world is he...]

898
01:01:56,719 --> 01:02:00,696
[My counter! It fell off!
Wait... the counter fell off!]

899
01:02:00,697 --> 01:02:04,261
[Giraffe's counter falls off!
He needs to get it back on his foot!]

900
01:02:05,256 --> 01:02:09,363
[Why does things like this always
happen to the Giraffe?]

901
01:02:16,163 --> 01:02:18,459
[Oh my goodness...]

902
01:02:18,460 --> 01:02:21,036
Wait! My counter!

903
01:02:21,037 --> 01:02:23,595
[The Giraffe's untiring breakdancing.]

904
01:02:30,198 --> 01:02:33,099
[The disco ride finally comes to a stop!]

905
01:02:35,417 --> 01:02:37,866
This shook more than usual.

906
01:02:37,867 --> 01:02:40,392
[What is the combined count
for Team Suzy?]

907
01:02:41,220 --> 01:02:43,692
10! 10! 10!

908
01:02:43,692 --> 01:02:48,994
[Jin Hee's total count is 10!]

909
01:02:48,994 --> 01:02:50,741
Jin Hee is no joke.

910
01:02:50,742 --> 01:02:52,144
10?

911
01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:57,294
[Ha Ha's total- 109]

912
01:02:57,856 --> 01:03:01,467
[Suzy's total count- 137]

913
01:03:03,251 --> 01:03:08,527
<i>You currently have 256 and if
Kwang Soo has less than 44, you succeed.</i>

914
01:03:08,528 --> 01:03:10,236
<i>Kwang Soo, what is your count?</i>

915
01:03:10,237 --> 01:03:12,118
198...

916
01:03:14,888 --> 01:03:18,209
[Team Suzy fails with 454.]

917
01:03:18,209 --> 01:03:19,894
I found 500 won.

918
01:03:23,151 --> 01:03:25,020
[On the other hand, Team Yubin is...]

919
01:03:25,021 --> 01:03:28,302
- We're here...
- Fried lettuce...

920
01:03:31,327 --> 01:03:34,621
Wow...
so this is the fried lettuce place.

921
01:03:36,032 --> 01:03:39,132
[King of snacks,
spicy rice cakes is a given.]

922
01:03:39,132 --> 01:03:43,775
[And the fame of Gwangju,
fried lettuce.]

923
01:03:43,776 --> 01:03:45,733
<i>This is fried lettuce.</i>

924
01:03:45,734 --> 01:03:50,016
- With the delicious food in front of you...
- We should eat then.

925
01:03:51,179 --> 01:03:53,656
[You have to receive your mission.]

926
01:03:54,361 --> 01:03:58,376
<i>[Blow the tissue with your mouth
and pass it to the person next to you.]</i>

927
01:03:58,377 --> 01:04:02,289
<i>[If you safely get it in the basket without
dropping it on the floor, you succeed!]</i>

928
01:04:02,290 --> 01:04:03,915
Ah... the tissue?

929
01:04:03,916 --> 01:04:06,231
[Get it in the goal by blowing the tissue.]

930
01:04:06,232 --> 01:04:09,919
[You must get five tissues in within
one minute by blowing it in!]

931
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:12,493
If you can get it to me,
I'll run over and blow it in!

932
01:04:12,494 --> 01:04:16,931
<i>The tissues that you use during the game
will have to be used by you later on.</i>

933
01:04:16,932 --> 01:04:20,091
<i>Ready... set... go!</i>

934
01:04:25,776 --> 01:04:27,860
[It's falling!]

935
01:04:28,303 --> 01:04:30,354
[Huh?]

936
01:04:30,355 --> 01:04:32,656
It's not on the ground yet!
It's not on the ground yet!

937
01:04:35,860 --> 01:04:38,079
[It's still hanging on the leg!]

938
01:04:38,079 --> 01:04:41,131
[Since it hasn't fallen on the ground yet,
they will be given the chance.]

939
01:04:41,132 --> 01:04:43,180
- It's not on the ground yet!
- Hold still. I'll blow it up.

940
01:04:45,935 --> 01:04:47,603
[He got it up!]

941
01:04:47,604 --> 01:04:49,867
[Ah... ultimately, it fell to the ground.]

942
01:04:49,868 --> 01:04:52,208
[With them fighting for a while,
20 seconds have already passed!]

943
01:04:52,209 --> 01:04:55,079
[Rushing to get the second tissue!]

944
01:05:05,682 --> 01:05:08,022
[This time, it falls on his shoulder!]

945
01:05:08,874 --> 01:05:12,006
[Barely gets one in!]

946
01:05:12,006 --> 01:05:15,164
[They have to succeed in getting four
more in during the time they have left!]

947
01:05:22,782 --> 01:05:26,155
[Jae Suk using his foot in haste.]

948
01:05:38,454 --> 01:05:40,936
[They got it!
Succeeds in getting two sheets in!]

949
01:05:46,302 --> 01:05:49,468
[After merely getting two sheets in,
the time on the clock is almost out!]

950
01:05:55,064 --> 01:05:58,396
[Time over!]

951
01:05:59,854 --> 01:06:03,411
[But for their first try,
it was a very good attempt!]

952
01:06:03,412 --> 01:06:04,976
I think I got it figured out.

953
01:06:04,977 --> 01:06:07,838
[Going right into their second attempt.]

954
01:06:14,816 --> 01:06:17,756
[Gary's got the feel for it now!]

955
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:23,448
[Oh my... having after done so well...]

956
01:06:23,449 --> 01:06:26,376
I got it... I got it!
You have to blow on it fast!

957
01:06:30,526 --> 01:06:33,178
[This time, blowing with all his might
all on his own again!]

958
01:06:36,216 --> 01:06:37,639
Jae Suk, I figured it out.

959
01:06:38,283 --> 01:06:41,409
[Tossing it lightly to Ji Sung.]

960
01:06:41,410 --> 01:06:46,707
[Then Gary will receive it and then... huh?]

961
01:06:46,708 --> 01:06:50,494
[Jae Suk receives it
and it lands on his lips?]

962
01:06:50,494 --> 01:06:52,616
[A kiss?]

963
01:06:54,343 --> 01:06:56,594
[Barely keeping the tissue alive!]

964
01:06:58,917 --> 01:07:00,891
[If they're careful with it,
they may get it in the basket?]

965
01:07:02,407 --> 01:07:04,207
[Too bad!]

966
01:07:11,629 --> 01:07:13,993
[By trying to move the basket again!]

967
01:07:14,728 --> 01:07:17,388
[Time over!]

968
01:07:21,079 --> 01:07:22,909
I'm getting angry!

969
01:07:25,522 --> 01:07:27,021
<i>Everyone...</i>

970
01:07:27,022 --> 01:07:28,867
<i>I'll give you the option of getting
three in within one minute...</i>

971
01:07:28,868 --> 01:07:31,186
<i>or getting one in within 25 seconds.</i>

972
01:07:31,186 --> 01:07:32,428
One within 25 seconds.

973
01:07:32,429 --> 01:07:34,851
[Simultaneously shouts out
one within 25 seconds.]

974
01:07:35,540 --> 01:07:39,307
- Isn't that a given?
- One, two, three! One within 25 seconds.

975
01:07:41,416 --> 01:07:44,885
[On the other hand,
at the amusement park.]

976
01:07:44,886 --> 01:07:47,211
[Still riding the mighty Disco ride!]

977
01:07:47,689 --> 01:07:51,411
[Putting in their best effort to lessen
the impact on their leg.]

978
01:08:00,979 --> 01:08:02,881
[Feeling like death...]

979
01:08:04,741 --> 01:08:06,566
[This is killing me.]

980
01:08:11,169 --> 01:08:13,274
[This person is about to pass out.]

981
01:08:19,233 --> 01:08:22,167
[Disco ride - Stop!]

982
01:08:22,711 --> 01:08:26,213
[Will the four of them combined
be less than 300 this time?]

983
01:08:26,549 --> 01:08:31,605
[Chang Ui's total count, 120.]

984
01:08:32,203 --> 01:08:38,697
[Mr. Capable's count, 49!]

985
01:08:40,095 --> 01:08:45,193
[Ji Hyo's count, 81.]

986
01:08:46,287 --> 01:08:51,985
[Current total is 250.
As long as Suk Jin has 50 or less...]

987
01:08:53,581 --> 01:08:56,955
[Wow! Suk Jin's count is 39!]

988
01:08:56,955 --> 01:09:01,069
[Team Ji Hyo succeeds with 289!]

989
01:09:01,069 --> 01:09:04,340
[His own personal victory!
They succeed with Big-nosed brother's play!]

990
01:09:04,340 --> 01:09:06,724
<i>Are you sure that the counter
was showing false count?</i>

991
01:09:06,725 --> 01:09:08,811
I was holding onto my leg!

992
01:09:09,932 --> 01:09:13,055
[Jin Hee's in the midst of
his coaching session again.]

993
01:09:13,056 --> 01:09:15,894
This bent leg will absorb all the shock,
so keep the other leg up.

994
01:09:15,895 --> 01:09:17,952
[That may sound easy...]

995
01:09:17,953 --> 01:09:21,798
- Just sit on the seat like this.
- When I was looking at you earlier...

996
01:09:21,799 --> 01:09:24,866
your back was being knocked around.

997
01:09:25,187 --> 01:09:27,036
That's why I raised up my leg.

998
01:09:27,037 --> 01:09:30,287
But we kept getting knocked around
like this.

999
01:09:30,288 --> 01:09:33,227
I know, but still...

1000
01:09:34,159 --> 01:09:37,869
[Anyways, they're going to go ahead
with Jin Hee's plan!]

1001
01:09:38,969 --> 01:09:42,890
[Make sure to keep the foot with
the counter attached up in the air!]

1002
01:09:45,847 --> 01:09:47,900
Put your foot up! Keep it up!

1003
01:09:51,975 --> 01:09:54,967
[They did as planned...
but what will the total count be?]

1004
01:09:55,877 --> 01:10:00,878
[Jin Hee's count - 11!]

1005
01:10:02,323 --> 01:10:04,635
Her count is 86.

1006
01:10:05,489 --> 01:10:07,356
[Suzy's count - 86!]

1007
01:10:08,781 --> 01:10:12,333
His count is 63.
[Kwang Soo's count - 63!]

1008
01:10:13,195 --> 01:10:20,070
[So far, the total count is 160. Success
as long as Ha Ha's is less than 140!]

1009
01:10:20,071 --> 01:10:21,696
- You know it's not over that!
- I don't' think it's over that.

1010
01:10:23,614 --> 01:10:25,688
[Ha Ha - 63!]

1011
01:10:25,688 --> 01:10:30,066
[Team Suzy succeeds with 223!]

1012
01:10:31,150 --> 01:10:34,286
[After working so hard just as
Coach Ji's plan outlined...]

1013
01:10:43,513 --> 01:10:46,226
[Team Suzy's turn to gain their hint.]

1014
01:10:46,227 --> 01:10:47,480
Please...

1015
01:10:47,481 --> 01:10:49,272
Gold!

1016
01:10:52,823 --> 01:10:55,835
What? Five is greater than zero?

1017
01:10:57,954 --> 01:11:00,818
Since we don't have much time,
let's talk about it on our way.

1018
01:11:00,819 --> 01:11:03,494
Thank you, everyone! Thank you!

1019
01:11:03,495 --> 01:11:05,580
- Goodbye!
- Goodbye!

1020
01:11:10,550 --> 01:11:14,248
[Right around the same time,
Team Yubin also succeeds their mission!]

1021
01:11:14,248 --> 01:11:16,740
[Choosing one of the hints...]

1022
01:11:21,266 --> 01:11:23,693
What is this? Two is greater than five?

1023
01:11:23,694 --> 01:11:27,271
<i>Think about your clue very carefully.</i>

1024
01:11:27,272 --> 01:11:29,688
- Thank you! We enjoyed the food!
- Thank you.

1025
01:11:29,689 --> 01:11:31,537
- Thank you.
- Goodbye.

1026
01:11:35,443 --> 01:11:37,295
<i>That's right, five is greater than zero.</i>

1027
01:11:37,296 --> 01:11:41,498
But five is less than two?
What is this? Two...

1028
01:11:42,620 --> 01:11:45,060
What about this? It's less than five,
but it's greater than two?

1029
01:11:46,062 --> 01:11:50,720
[If they try to make it complicated,
there's no end in sight.]

1030
01:11:50,721 --> 01:11:51,996
This isn't easy.

1031
01:11:53,623 --> 01:11:55,987
<i>Two, five and zero...</i>

1032
01:11:55,988 --> 01:11:58,283
In reality,
five should be greater than two...

1033
01:11:58,908 --> 01:12:04,898
[Different than the number concepts
they're familiar with.]

1034
01:12:06,873 --> 01:12:10,074
We need to know what
five, two and zero means...

1035
01:12:10,075 --> 01:12:10,986
[Is there a different meaning
behind the numbers?]

1036
01:12:17,875 --> 01:12:19,847
What do those say?

1037
01:12:19,848 --> 01:12:22,782
Zero, one, two, five!

1038
01:12:23,940 --> 01:12:25,708
[Blank...]

1039
01:12:25,709 --> 01:12:27,915
It said one, zero, two, five.
As in October 25th.

1040
01:12:28,502 --> 01:12:31,281
- Something about construction expo...
- Construction expo?

1041
01:12:31,282 --> 01:12:34,288
[Like Suzy's movie,
'Introduction to Architecture'?]

1042
01:12:34,289 --> 01:12:37,197
You know what we initially were
talking about?

1043
01:12:38,368 --> 01:12:42,733
Instead of thinking that it's greater than,
maybe it's stronger than?

1044
01:12:44,169 --> 01:12:47,153
Instead of it being a number,
it could be a count of something.

1045
01:12:47,154 --> 01:12:52,369
Like if there are five people,
it's not as... Ah!

1046
01:12:53,795 --> 01:12:56,373
[Did Ha Ha realize something?]

1047
01:12:56,373 --> 01:13:00,622
[Just what is the answer to the riddle
that he just realized?]

1048
01:13:03,402 --> 01:13:05,335
- What is this now?
- I don't know.

1049
01:13:06,655 --> 01:13:08,440
What is this...

1050
01:13:09,264 --> 01:13:12,153
[Gwangju City bus square]

1051
01:13:13,652 --> 01:13:15,464
[A vaulting horse?]

1052
01:13:24,521 --> 01:13:27,548
[Gwangju tour riddle race.
What is their final mission?]

1053
01:13:27,548 --> 01:13:30,109
<i>[Use the vaulting horse to land on
the archery scoreboard.]</i>

1054
01:13:30,109 --> 01:13:33,462
<i>[And if the combined score of everyone
is more than 10 points, then you succeed.]</i>

1055
01:13:33,463 --> 01:13:38,832
<i>This is because both the gymnastics and
archery athletes are from Gwangju</i>

1056
01:13:38,833 --> 01:13:41,693
<i>that's why we created this hybrid game.</i>

1057
01:13:41,694 --> 01:13:42,911
Yes, I understand.

1058
01:13:48,676 --> 01:13:52,139
[Team Suzy and Team Ji Hyo
also arrives shortly after.]

1059
01:13:54,659 --> 01:13:56,213
Fighting!

1060
01:13:59,859 --> 01:14:01,879
[Team Yubin is first to make their
attempt!]

1061
01:14:01,880 --> 01:14:03,528
Gary, fighting!

1062
01:14:03,529 --> 01:14:06,408
[Use the vault to jump and score more than
10 points with the whole team combined!]

1063
01:14:06,408 --> 01:14:08,244
[First one up for Team Yubin is Gary.]

1064
01:14:09,897 --> 01:14:13,232
[Jump as far as you can to
score the highest score possible!]

1065
01:14:13,233 --> 01:14:16,746
[Wherever the toe lands
will be the point given.]

1066
01:14:17,066 --> 01:14:19,979
[In front of countless Gwangju citizens...]

1067
01:14:19,980 --> 01:14:21,612
[Even though it's nerve-wracking,
jump with confidence!]

1068
01:14:22,656 --> 01:14:24,586
[Here I go!]

1069
01:14:31,910 --> 01:14:33,782
[A high jump!]

1070
01:14:34,432 --> 01:14:38,696
[Just what will he land on?]

1071
01:14:41,776 --> 01:14:43,962
[Scores three points.]

1072
01:14:47,447 --> 01:14:50,364
[Even though it was his first attempt,
he coolly scores three points!]

1073
01:14:57,370 --> 01:14:59,919
[And finishing it up with a strut.]

1074
01:14:59,920 --> 01:15:02,689
[10 points or above combined.
Gary scored three points for Team Yubin!]

1075
01:15:03,356 --> 01:15:05,426
I'm so embarrassed!
This is so embarrassing!

1076
01:15:05,427 --> 01:15:09,994
[If the other three scores a total of
seven points, it's a success!]

1077
01:15:09,994 --> 01:15:13,964
[Second jumper for Team Yubin is Jae Suk!]

1078
01:15:13,965 --> 01:15:15,777
I have to get three points too...

1079
01:15:15,778 --> 01:15:19,223
<i>Yoo Jae Suk! Yoo Jae Suk!</i>

1080
01:15:19,612 --> 01:15:23,788
[I have to get at least three points
to make it less burdensome for others...]

1081
01:15:23,788 --> 01:15:26,048
[Harden up his resolve, and go!]

1082
01:15:26,049 --> 01:15:27,360
You can do it!

1083
01:15:34,460 --> 01:15:36,310
[Lands at two point line!]

1084
01:15:36,311 --> 01:15:39,082
[Jumped like a grasshopper to
gain another two points for the team!]

1085
01:15:44,174 --> 01:15:47,487
[It would've been nice if I could've
jumped just a little bit further...]

1086
01:15:47,487 --> 01:15:51,564
[Team Yubin - Gary's three points
and Jae Suk's two points.]

1087
01:15:54,055 --> 01:15:57,525
[The third jumper for Team Yubin, Ji Sung.]

1088
01:15:58,758 --> 01:16:01,519
[Jumping into it without any hesitation!]

1089
01:16:04,245 --> 01:16:06,330
[So lightly!]

1090
01:16:08,704 --> 01:16:10,895
[And the result of his jump is?]

1091
01:16:14,205 --> 01:16:16,709
[Going by where his toes landed,
he scores three points!]

1092
01:16:18,380 --> 01:16:21,764
[Ji Sung, easily gains another three points!]

1093
01:16:22,807 --> 01:16:26,857
[Team Yubin: Gary- three points,
Jae Suk- two points, Ji Sung- three points]

1094
01:16:26,857 --> 01:16:32,165
[In that case... if Yubin can score
two points, it's a success for the team!]

1095
01:16:32,166 --> 01:16:34,120
- Yubin, fighting!
- Yubin!

1096
01:16:35,018 --> 01:16:37,958
Your toes... you just
need to get your toes in there!

1097
01:16:39,603 --> 01:16:43,021
[Even if she scores just two points,
they'll succeed with a total of 10 points!]

1098
01:16:43,021 --> 01:16:46,113
[No big deal...]

1099
01:16:46,450 --> 01:16:49,241
[Without any hesitation!]

1100
01:16:49,242 --> 01:16:50,776
<i>With confidence!</i>

1101
01:17:04,141 --> 01:17:08,402
[Jumping with confidence... to plunk!]

1102
01:17:10,614 --> 01:17:13,062
[With Yubin falling in the water,
she garners zero points.]

1103
01:17:13,062 --> 01:17:17,082
[Gary- 3 points, Jae Suk- 2 points,
Ji Sung- 3 points, Yubin- 0 points= Fail.]

1104
01:17:18,990 --> 01:17:21,030
[Next team on deck, Team Suzy.]

1105
01:17:21,900 --> 01:17:25,930
[Team Suzy's first jumper, Ji Jin Hee.]

1106
01:17:25,931 --> 01:17:27,770
Challenge.

1107
01:17:27,771 --> 01:17:30,193
- Ha Ha, you're next, right?
- Yeah, I think so.

1108
01:17:31,667 --> 01:17:34,548
[Coach Ji, will you
show us your skills here too?]

1109
01:17:38,285 --> 01:17:40,404
[Going by where the toe lands!
He lands on 3 point section!]

1110
01:17:44,585 --> 01:17:48,530
[Jin Hee scores three points for Team Suzy!]

1111
01:17:50,123 --> 01:17:52,255
- Three points!
- You have to stretch your feet out.

1112
01:17:53,576 --> 01:17:55,519
My pants are way too tight.

1113
01:17:56,844 --> 01:18:00,033
[Second jumper for Team Suzy, Ha Ha.]

1114
01:18:00,033 --> 01:18:02,098
I want you to ride the wave!

1115
01:18:14,259 --> 01:18:17,100
[Starting after hearing Byul's name?]

1116
01:18:30,682 --> 01:18:32,677
[Team Suzy's Ha Ha gains one point.]

1117
01:18:32,678 --> 01:18:35,012
[Team Suzy has a total of four points.]

1118
01:18:35,013 --> 01:18:36,104
<i>Can I go now?</i>

1119
01:18:36,105 --> 01:18:37,968
[Third jumper, Suzy]

1120
01:18:46,374 --> 01:18:49,849
[Suzy still gains one point!]

1121
01:18:51,353 --> 01:18:52,997
<i>Suzy, are you okay?</i>

1122
01:18:57,250 --> 01:18:58,377
[Currently, a total of five points!]

1123
01:18:58,377 --> 01:19:02,915
[If the Giraffe gets five points,
then they succeed!]

1124
01:19:02,915 --> 01:19:04,903
He needs to get five points.
Five points.

1125
01:19:04,904 --> 01:19:07,861
[Can he jump this far?]

1126
01:19:08,842 --> 01:19:10,633
[He may be good at it since
he's so tall?]

1127
01:19:22,665 --> 01:19:27,575
[After jumping like that...
a mere two points?]

1128
01:19:28,091 --> 01:19:32,070
[Team Suzy fails with
a total of seven points.]

1129
01:19:33,861 --> 01:19:36,699
You have to jump big!

1130
01:19:36,700 --> 01:19:39,689
[What a right thing to say...]

1131
01:19:40,875 --> 01:19:44,262
[Team Ji Hyo's turn!]

1132
01:19:44,263 --> 01:19:46,528
- Okay, let's do this.
- Is it okay?

1133
01:19:47,823 --> 01:19:50,224
Since the others got three points,
you should at least get four points.

1134
01:19:51,386 --> 01:19:52,617
Should I go now?

1135
01:19:52,618 --> 01:19:55,483
[Team Ji Hyo's first jumper, Mr. Capable.]

1136
01:19:57,575 --> 01:20:01,510
[Demanding for him to show that
he is on a different level.]

1137
01:20:01,511 --> 01:20:04,962

1138
01:20:04,963 --> 01:20:07,288
[Will he be able to do it?]

1139
01:20:09,803 --> 01:20:12,042
[Fly!]

1140
01:20:15,320 --> 01:20:19,676
[Just how many points?]

1141
01:20:23,790 --> 01:20:26,119
[What did he land on?]

1142
01:20:26,119 --> 01:20:27,905
[His toe lands in the four point zone!]

1143
01:20:31,191 --> 01:20:34,667
[An amazing jump that renders
the ones watching speechless.]

1144
01:20:38,170 --> 01:20:41,796
[Flying high to gain the first
four points in the game!]

1145
01:20:42,879 --> 01:20:48,234
[If the rest of Team Ji Hyo can gain
six more points!]

1146
01:20:51,787 --> 01:20:56,016
[Team Ji Hyo's second jumper,
Chang Ui.]

1147
01:20:57,435 --> 01:20:59,003
I can't wait to see what
Chang Ui does.

1148
01:21:00,155 --> 01:21:03,737
[The glint in his eye...
how many points will Chang Ui get?]

1149
01:21:09,813 --> 01:21:13,438
[Flying high like Mr. Capable did!]

1150
01:21:23,446 --> 01:21:26,366
[Something doesn't seem right
about this.]

1151
01:21:27,946 --> 01:21:30,355
[Barely gains two points.]

1152
01:21:32,129 --> 01:21:36,158
[Current score for Team Ji Hyo:
Jong Kook - 4 points, Chang Ui - 2 points.]

1153
01:21:36,159 --> 01:21:39,733
[At least, Ace Ji Hyo's turn!]

1154
01:21:39,734 --> 01:21:43,035
[When it comes to her,
three points could be possible?]

1155
01:21:49,963 --> 01:21:54,622
[Hitting the vaulting board on the way...]

1156
01:21:58,516 --> 01:22:02,867
[With her Ace reputation...
nicely scores zero points!]

1157
01:22:04,824 --> 01:22:08,095
- Hey...
- What the heck is this?

1158
01:22:09,967 --> 01:22:13,933
[Team Ji Hyo currently has six points!]

1159
01:22:13,934 --> 01:22:16,835
[The fate of the team rests on
the shoulders of Big-nosed brother!]

1160
01:22:17,565 --> 01:22:19,974
[If jumps four points or above,
then the team succeeds!]

1161
01:22:22,275 --> 01:22:26,415
[Big-nosed brother... will he be
able to pull a Herculean miracle?]

1162
01:22:36,601 --> 01:22:39,285
[What in the world...]

1163
01:22:45,535 --> 01:22:49,572
[After giving after a big laugh,
he manages zero points.]

1164
01:22:50,191 --> 01:22:54,447
[Team Ji Hyo fails with six points.]

1165
01:22:56,721 --> 01:23:00,443
At least I jumped it...
for the first time in my life, I jumped it.

1166
01:23:00,444 --> 01:23:03,419
<i>Everyone... I have a proposal for you.</i>

1167
01:23:03,420 --> 01:23:07,333
<i>I will give you one point for
landing in the water.</i>

1168
01:23:07,334 --> 01:23:11,009
<i>And I will pull the score board
one point closer to the vaulting board.</i>

1169
01:23:11,010 --> 01:23:12,339
Okay.

1170
01:23:12,340 --> 01:23:16,024
[At this rate, it may be possible to
pass with a little more effort!]

1171
01:23:16,972 --> 01:23:19,067
[Team Yubin's turn again.]

1172
01:23:19,068 --> 01:23:21,310
Gary, fighting!

1173
01:23:21,311 --> 01:23:23,574
[The first jumper again is Gary.]

1174
01:23:25,920 --> 01:23:27,908
Gary, fighting!

1175
01:23:28,590 --> 01:23:32,435
[Gary's who's shown us his
most confident side earlier.]

1176
01:23:32,436 --> 01:23:34,990
[His endless hidden skills!
What will he score this time?]

1177
01:23:42,357 --> 01:23:45,246
[Five points!]

1178
01:23:45,246 --> 01:23:48,168
[Amazing, Kang Gary!]

1179
01:23:50,296 --> 01:23:53,934
[Kang Gary's scary skills that takes
everyone by surprise once in a while!]

1180
01:23:55,535 --> 01:23:59,014
[Another chic ending...]

1181
01:23:59,014 --> 01:24:01,922
[I'm cool...]

1182
01:24:02,490 --> 01:24:05,358
[Team Yubin is suddenly up
at five points!]

1183
01:24:06,232 --> 01:24:10,175
[Gary acting cool is the funniest part!]

1184
01:24:12,462 --> 01:24:16,560
[Second jumper Jae Suk
with a little less burden.]

1185
01:24:20,488 --> 01:24:24,610
[There it is! The feverish cheer!]

1186
01:24:28,401 --> 01:24:29,913
[Jae Suk is on the move!]

1187
01:24:34,426 --> 01:24:37,519
[Far... far away!]

1188
01:24:42,410 --> 01:24:45,196
[Four points!]

1189
01:24:45,197 --> 01:24:48,871
[Jae Suk gains four points!
Team Yubin has a total score of nine points!]

1190
01:24:54,994 --> 01:24:57,266
[Team Yubin's lead athlete,
Ji Sung's turn!]

1191
01:24:57,266 --> 01:24:59,482
[I will finish this!]

1192
01:25:00,738 --> 01:25:02,958
[Flying lightly through the air again!]

1193
01:25:05,394 --> 01:25:08,166
[Scoring three points with ease!]

1194
01:25:08,167 --> 01:25:11,027
[Team Yubin: Gary- 5 points,
Jae Suk- 4 points. Ji Sung- 3 points.]

1195
01:25:11,028 --> 01:25:15,288
[Team Yubin succeeds
with a total of 12 points!]

1196
01:25:17,841 --> 01:25:22,592
[With cheers from the crowd,
first to leave for the final location!]

1197
01:25:25,811 --> 01:25:28,098
<i>Here is your final clue.</i>

1198
01:25:28,099 --> 01:25:30,885
[Team Yubin earns their final clue.]

1199
01:25:31,998 --> 01:25:33,478
Just what in the world is this?

1200
01:25:40,178 --> 01:25:44,225
[Can discuss it on the way!
Hurry on to the final location!]

1201
01:25:44,226 --> 01:25:47,276
- What is this...
- Just what in the world is this?

1202
01:25:47,277 --> 01:25:49,824
After having come all the way
to Gwangju...

1203
01:25:54,099 --> 01:25:55,890
Hey, just what in the world is this?

1204
01:25:55,891 --> 01:25:58,106
Of course, zero equals zero.

1205
01:25:58,107 --> 01:26:01,157
And I think this is going to be
the final destination.

1206
01:26:01,158 --> 01:26:02,822
What does zero equal zero mean?

1207
01:26:02,823 --> 01:26:04,981
Don't we have to solve the riddle quickly?

1208
01:26:04,982 --> 01:26:07,234
I don't think this means numbers, right?

1209
01:26:07,830 --> 01:26:10,948
[Gary in deep thoughts without
any words.]

1210
01:26:10,949 --> 01:26:14,272
- Why is two greater than five?
- That's what I don't get.

1211
01:26:14,878 --> 01:26:17,154
How can two be greater than five?

1212
01:26:17,155 --> 01:26:20,241
I think there's something there,
but I don't know what that could be.

1213
01:26:20,242 --> 01:26:22,296
Two is greater than five...

1214
01:26:28,592 --> 01:26:34,652
- Two is less than zero...
- And five is also less than two...

1215
01:26:34,653 --> 01:26:38,017
[Starting to deduce that it has
nothing to do with numbers.]

1216
01:26:39,093 --> 01:26:42,650
[Team Ji Hyo is also just as confused.]

1217
01:26:45,349 --> 01:26:47,992
[Two is being crushed by zero...]

1218
01:26:47,993 --> 01:26:49,763
And five is less than two...

1219
01:26:49,764 --> 01:26:52,165
I think this is like a food chain.

1220
01:26:52,166 --> 01:26:58,761
Zero eats the two... and two eats
the five and five eats the zero?

1221
01:26:58,762 --> 01:27:00,976
[Wait...]

1222
01:27:02,707 --> 01:27:06,259
Win... zero beats two.

1223
01:27:06,260 --> 01:27:10,442
- I got it! I got it!
- What? What is it?

1224
01:27:11,544 --> 01:27:15,397
[Just what could be the answer that
Mr. Capable has deduced?]

1225
01:27:21,708 --> 01:27:25,902
<i>Since you were the first to arrive,
you get the biggest advantage.</i>

1226
01:27:25,903 --> 01:27:27,872
- You can open it once you're inside.
- I understand.

1227
01:27:30,206 --> 01:27:32,195
[Inside...]

1228
01:27:32,773 --> 01:27:37,100
[Is it a structure the three teams
can stand on?]

1229
01:27:41,009 --> 01:27:47,674
[With that aside...
Team Yubin still has no answer.]

1230
01:27:48,241 --> 01:27:51,027
[Huh? That is...]

1231
01:27:55,574 --> 01:27:59,014
[It seems as though
Gary has thought of something!]

1232
01:27:59,015 --> 01:28:02,179
I figured it out...
this was actually very simple.

1233
01:28:02,180 --> 01:28:03,647
This was very simple.

1234
01:28:05,730 --> 01:28:07,311
You figured it out too?
You just figured it out, didn't you?

1235
01:28:07,312 --> 01:28:08,362
You know it too, right?

1236
01:28:08,362 --> 01:28:11,553
[Just then, Team Ji Hyo also arrives.]

1237
01:28:12,609 --> 01:28:15,969
[It seems as though both teams have
figured it out, but is it the right answer?]

1238
01:28:20,583 --> 01:28:28,133
[This is the National Asia's Cultural Center
slated to be completed in 2012.]

1239
01:28:28,133 --> 01:28:32,452
[The mystery of the riddle will be solved
in this future heart of our culture.]

1240
01:28:32,453 --> 01:28:36,640
<i>I don't know if you've all figured it out,
but you'll all be given a white board.</i>

1241
01:28:36,641 --> 01:28:41,152
<i>After writing what you think the answer
is to the riddle on the board...</i>

1242
01:28:41,153 --> 01:28:44,747
<i>lift up the board in our direction
at the count of three.</i>

1243
01:28:46,239 --> 01:28:50,152
<i>One team at a time will reveal their
answer starting with Team Yubin.</i>

1244
01:28:50,153 --> 01:28:53,461
<i>Please lift it up high towards the front.
One, two, three!</i>

1245
01:28:56,914 --> 01:29:00,374
[Rock-paper-scissors]

1246
01:29:02,129 --> 01:29:08,665
[A man of many wonders, Kang Gary...
after having opened up his hand by chance...]

1247
01:29:08,666 --> 01:29:10,137
<i>You figured it out too, didn't you?</i>

1248
01:29:11,747 --> 01:29:13,581
<i>[Rock-paper-scissors]</i>

1249
01:29:17,539 --> 01:29:19,909
[Next, Team Ji Hyo's turn
to reveal their answer!]

1250
01:29:21,787 --> 01:29:25,131
Again, Rock-paper-scissors!

1251
01:29:26,698 --> 01:29:29,187
- I think this is like the food chain...
- Food chain?

1252
01:29:29,188 --> 01:29:31,020
[Big-nosed brother's deduction,
food chain...]

1253
01:29:31,021 --> 01:29:38,240
- Two eats five... and zero eats two...
- I got it!

1254
01:29:38,241 --> 01:29:41,242
- I got it! I got it!
- What? What is it?

1255
01:29:41,243 --> 01:29:43,026
Rock-paper-scissors!

1256
01:29:43,027 --> 01:29:45,970
Zero... two...

1257
01:29:48,142 --> 01:29:52,861
[Not a bad deduction! Is the
correct answer Rock-paper-scissors?]

1258
01:29:52,862 --> 01:29:55,893
[And lastly, Team Suzy's answer?]

1259
01:29:55,894 --> 01:29:58,625
Rock-paper-scissors.

1260
01:29:58,625 --> 01:30:01,375
[All the teams answer
Rock-paper-scissors.]

1261
01:30:02,141 --> 01:30:06,021
[That's right! The answer
to the riddle is Rock-paper-scissors!]

1262
01:30:06,021 --> 01:30:07,929
I had no idea that all of us
would get the same answer.

1263
01:30:07,930 --> 01:30:10,610
What happens now, Gary?

1264
01:30:10,611 --> 01:30:15,803
[All the viewer's get it too, right?
Rock-paper-scissors?]

1265
01:30:16,615 --> 01:30:18,452
[Rock]

1266
01:30:18,452 --> 01:30:20,619
[Scissors]

1267
01:30:20,619 --> 01:30:22,999
[Paper]

1268
01:30:34,236 --> 01:30:37,575
[All three teams answered correctly!]

1269
01:30:37,575 --> 01:30:40,222
[But this isn't the end!]

1270
01:30:40,223 --> 01:30:43,357
[The correct answer isn't the end!]

1271
01:30:43,358 --> 01:30:45,630
<i>Please open up the envelope you received
at the door and show it to everyone.</i>

1272
01:30:45,631 --> 01:30:48,563
[Open up the mysterious envelope they
received at the door!]

1273
01:30:49,864 --> 01:30:54,559
Four people can participate!

1274
01:30:54,560 --> 01:30:56,715
Three people can participate.

1275
01:30:56,716 --> 01:30:59,324
[A piece of paper with how many people
are able to participate written on it.]

1276
01:31:00,314 --> 01:31:05,698
[If they hadn't figured out the correct answer
participation wouldn't have been possible.]

1277
01:31:05,698 --> 01:31:07,732
<i>But since everyone came up
with the correct answer</i>

1278
01:31:07,733 --> 01:31:11,336
<i>the final team left remaining after a round
of Rock-paper-scissors is the winner.</i>

1279
01:31:12,778 --> 01:31:16,648
[This is today's Riddle Race's ending!]

1280
01:31:20,986 --> 01:31:26,709
[Team Yubin- 4 people, Team Suzy- 2 people,
and Team Ji Hyo- 3 people can participate!]

1281
01:31:27,876 --> 01:31:30,308
[A mental fight from the start!]

1282
01:31:32,074 --> 01:31:36,652
[A face off with a member of each team
to start off the game!]

1283
01:31:36,653 --> 01:31:38,384
- Fighting!
- Fighting!

1284
01:31:42,432 --> 01:31:45,383
Do you feel the need to film us playing
Rock-paper-scissors up this close?

1285
01:31:47,058 --> 01:31:51,946
[The ultimate game of Rock-paper-scissors,
which no one can predict the results!]

1286
01:31:51,947 --> 01:31:55,394
[The final face off,
Rock-paper-scissors- first round!]

1287
01:31:55,395 --> 01:31:57,417
Rock-paper-scissors!

1288
01:31:59,244 --> 01:32:01,748
I won!
[Team Yubin Jae Suk's win!]

1289
01:32:01,748 --> 01:32:05,589
[Jae Suk is the only one to throw out
a scissors, so he wins!]

1290
01:32:09,624 --> 01:32:14,247
[Four people! Team Yubin with the most
number of participants takes the lead!]

1291
01:32:14,248 --> 01:32:16,000
<i>Those who lost, please step down.</i>

1292
01:32:16,001 --> 01:32:18,744
<i>Kim Jong Kook and Suzy
can step down now.</i>

1293
01:32:18,745 --> 01:32:20,784
<i>That's so annoying!</i>

1294
01:32:23,731 --> 01:32:29,723
[Jin Hee vs. Chang Ui vs. Jae Suk]

1295
01:32:29,724 --> 01:32:33,574
- It's too easy, isn't it?
- If Jin Hee loses, that's it for this team?

1296
01:32:33,575 --> 01:32:34,905
<i>That's correct.</i>

1297
01:32:34,906 --> 01:32:38,160

<i>Rock-paper-scissors</i>

1300

[All three throws out paper.]

1301
01:32:45,446 --> 01:32:48,870
[Tougher for those standing by watching.]

1302
01:32:48,871 --> 01:32:51,421
- This is making me really nervous.
- This is really nerve wrecking.

1303
01:32:52,319 --> 01:32:54,230
<i>Rock-paper-scissors!</i>

1304
01:32:56,213 --> 01:32:57,881
[This time, everyone throws out
a scissors!]

01:32:59,712 --> 01:33:02,289

nervousness!]

[Team Suzy eliminated from the
competition!]

1309
01:33:27,024 --> 01:33:30,128
[They were in such high spirits all day...]

the advantage, you never know in this game!]

<i>This could be what you're
good at, Chang Ui!</i>

1314
01:33:49,628 --> 01:33:51,941

You can finish this!

[Their final warrior, Suk Jin!]

1320
01:34:11,122 --> 01:34:12,528
It's okay, we have our Suk Jin.

1321
