[What he wants...]

5
00:00:09,886 --> 00:00:11,606
[There's just one thing that he wants]

6
00:00:12,361 --> 00:00:16,956
[On that day two years ago... the insult...]

7
00:00:16,957 --> 00:00:18,893
[Okay... the game starts now.]

8

<i>Hello.</i>

16
00:00:51,786 --> 00:00:56,659
What is this? The Monday couple?
What is this couple thing about?

17
00:00:56,954 --> 00:00:59,280
<i>You're obstructing the sign.</i>

18
00:01:02,614 --> 00:01:04,051
Hi, Suk Jin...

19
00:01:04,844 --> 00:01:08,411
- We're... pairing off today.
- Pairing off?

20
00:01:08,412 --> 00:01:10,796
Would it be okay for me to have
some expectations today?

21
00:01:10,797 --> 00:01:12,493
Who? Yang Jung Ah?

22
00:01:13,689 --> 00:01:15,840
- Jung Ah...
- Yang Jung Ah...

23
00:01:15,841 --> 00:01:17,753
Does he think he's going to the sauna?

24
00:01:17,754 --> 00:01:20,755
Why is he in just a shirt?
Isn't he even cold?

25
00:01:20,756 --> 00:01:22,349
[The manly man, Kkuk arrives.]

26
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:24,887
Why do you have the shirt open like that
when it's so windy out today?

27
00:01:24,888 --> 00:01:27,425
- What the heck is that?
- Hey...

28
00:01:27,426 --> 00:01:29,353
- What are you doing?
- Well, I...

29
00:01:32,035 --> 00:01:33,814
What are you doing?

30
00:01:33,815 --> 00:01:37,218
- I didn't know it would do that!
- Why did you pull on my shirt?

31
00:01:37,219 --> 00:01:40,001
Why are you wearing a shirt
with snaps?

32
00:01:40,744 --> 00:01:44,272
[Unhappy with how he flaunts
his body even in this chilly weather.]

33
00:01:44,273 --> 00:01:47,358
Can't you tell by looking at the shirt
how it snaps? You shouldn't have pulled...

34
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:49,038
Why aren't you even wearing
any socks?

35
00:01:49,039 --> 00:01:50,854
I do have socks on.
They're just not showing.

36
00:01:50,855 --> 00:01:53,233
What are you doing?
Start dressing appropriately.

37
00:01:53,234 --> 00:01:56,202
Then are we...
are we being paired off today?

38
00:01:56,203 --> 00:01:57,405
- Yeah!
- Seriously?

39
00:01:57,405 --> 00:01:59,055
Hello, brothers!

40
00:01:59,056 --> 00:02:01,611
<i>Wow... it's really windy!</i>

41
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:04,172
It's really windy.

[Greeting everyone with their eyes shut
tight against the fiercely strong wind.]

43
00:02:08,798 --> 00:02:11,323
What do you mean, good morning?
It's three o'clock in the afternoon.

44
00:02:11,793 --> 00:02:14,635
Why isn't Gary here? Kang Gary!

45
00:02:14,636 --> 00:02:17,361
- Where are you?
- I'm not going anywhere!

46
00:02:19,423 --> 00:02:22,301
<i>[This man is a trouble maker.]</i>

47
00:02:24,951 --> 00:02:28,451
- No more... seriously, no more!
- Why are you trying to scare us?

48
00:02:28,486 --> 00:02:31,451
- Enough...
- What's going on here?

49
00:02:31,452 --> 00:02:35,895
<i>[Today's mission is 'Pairs'-
I want to become Monday Couple too.]</i>

50
00:02:35,896 --> 00:02:38,394
The wind is blowing so hard that it's
changing the part in my hair.

51
00:02:38,395 --> 00:02:39,918
- Please tell us quickly.
- Tell us what's going on.

52
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:45,241
<i>Starting with Yoo Jae Suk down to Kwang Soo,
you'll become males number one through six.</i>

53
00:02:45,242 --> 00:02:46,550
I've seen this show on TV!

54
00:02:46,551 --> 00:02:50,337
<i>As for the details,
once the lady participants arrive...</i>

55
00:02:50,338 --> 00:02:53,168
- Women participants?
- Women, women, women...

56
00:02:53,169 --> 00:02:55,525
Why are you getting all excited
when you have Moon Geun Young?

57
00:02:57,324 --> 00:03:00,252
I think someone's here.
There's a car pulling up.

58
00:03:00,629 --> 00:03:02,574
<i>I wonder who's going to get out?</i>

59
00:03:04,552 --> 00:03:05,942
- Who is it?
- Who could it be?

60
00:03:06,898 --> 00:03:09,858
[Black cars are starting to
pull up one by one.]

61
00:03:09,859 --> 00:03:12,222
- Is that Ji Hyo's car?
- I'm sure she'll be paired up with Gary.

62
00:03:12,223 --> 00:03:13,389
Come on, I doubt it.

63
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:15,876
<i>All the lady participants have arrived.</i>

64
00:03:15,877 --> 00:03:18,739
Wait... shouldn't there be six ladies?

65
00:03:19,145 --> 00:03:20,335
Do you think only one person
is getting paired up?

66
00:03:20,336 --> 00:03:23,597
- Do you think it's a girl group?
- You think they'll all get out together?

67
00:03:23,598 --> 00:03:25,314
Wait... someone's about to get out.

68
00:03:25,976 --> 00:03:28,791
[Just who could it be?]

69
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:30,471
[Blank Ji]

70
00:03:30,794 --> 00:03:32,899
- It's Ji Hyo!
- Ji Hyo? It's just Ji Hyo.

71
00:03:39,431 --> 00:03:41,728
[Ji Hyo looking especially beautiful today.]

72
00:03:42,235 --> 00:03:44,434
Why is she wearing heels?

73
00:03:51,392 --> 00:03:53,553
- Ji Hyo, why are you looking so pretty today?
- Why are you looking so skinny?

74
00:03:53,709 --> 00:03:55,332
You have something planned for today,
don't you?

75
00:03:56,548 --> 00:03:58,709
- What do mean, something planned?
- I think you've gotten prettier.

76
00:03:58,709 --> 00:04:01,175
[Everyone acting a little awkward
over how pretty Ji Hyo looks today.]

77
00:04:01,176 --> 00:04:03,137
With you clubbing lately...

78
00:04:03,137 --> 00:04:05,098
I don't know if it's because you've been
clubbing, but you've gotten prettier lately.

79
00:04:05,099 --> 00:04:06,722
[Becoming beautiful for her club outings?]

80
00:04:07,678 --> 00:04:11,479
[Immediately picking up the club vibe.]

81
00:04:14,947 --> 00:04:16,806
<i>One last lady participant is waiting.</i>

82
00:04:16,807 --> 00:04:18,638
- What did you say? Last?
- What do you mean, last?

83
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,526
[There are six men,
but already down to the last lady?]

84
00:04:20,527 --> 00:04:22,928
We're getting paired off,
so there should be five more.

85
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:24,095
She's getting off!

86
00:04:25,536 --> 00:04:28,736
[The car door opens...]

87
00:04:33,732 --> 00:04:38,122
[The one who will protect even the wolf...
Park Bo Young.]

88
00:04:38,332 --> 00:04:40,072
Bo Young!

89
00:04:40,073 --> 00:04:41,982
<i>Hello!</i>

90
00:04:42,964 --> 00:04:45,601
You can't block the camera
just because Bo Young is here!

91
00:04:45,602 --> 00:04:47,040
Hello!

92
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:50,210
- Bo Young, have you been well?
- Yes, hello!

93
00:04:50,211 --> 00:04:53,384
- It really has been a long time!
- Hey... wolf girl!

94
00:04:53,385 --> 00:04:56,227
- Hello.
- Hi, it's good to see you.

95
00:04:56,228 --> 00:04:58,763
- Bo Young!
- Yes, it's good to see you.

96
00:04:58,764 --> 00:05:01,209
Bo Young... Bo Young!

97
00:05:01,908 --> 00:05:05,898
[Bo Young too preoccupied with
making sure to greet everyone.]

98
00:05:05,899 --> 00:05:08,108
Were you the only one in there?
There's no one else in that car?

99
00:05:08,109 --> 00:05:09,975
- No, it was just me.
- But we need five more...

100
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:12,719
- Don't say things like that!
- There should be four more in there!

101
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,513
<i>Shouldn't we just be happy
to have Bo Young here?</i>

102
00:05:14,514 --> 00:05:16,307
How is this 'Pairs'?

103
00:05:16,308 --> 00:05:18,332
- You seem disappointed.
- There should be four more ladies!

104
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:20,564
You seem really disappointed...

105
00:05:20,565 --> 00:05:23,536
- There's another car over there!
- That car is pulling out.

106
00:05:25,646 --> 00:05:27,983
[Giraffe putting on his debonair act.]

107
00:05:27,984 --> 00:05:30,031
- Don't do things like that!
- What are you doing?

108
00:05:30,032 --> 00:05:31,754
Why are you reacting like this?

109
00:05:31,755 --> 00:05:34,357
[Getting criticized from trying to act cool.]

110
00:05:34,357 --> 00:05:37,055
If you're going to take it off,
take it all off!

111
00:05:40,158 --> 00:05:42,864
[Forcing him... to strip?]

112
00:05:46,074 --> 00:05:47,494
Don't look!

113
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:54,605
[Giraffe exposing his bust.]

114
00:05:55,752 --> 00:05:57,980
[Using his leopard print scarf in a rush...]

115
00:05:57,981 --> 00:06:00,053
[Chief of the Giraffe tribe?]

116
00:06:01,881 --> 00:06:03,740
You really took my clothes off!

117
00:06:03,741 --> 00:06:05,588
Kwang Soo, here...

118
00:06:05,967 --> 00:06:08,416
- Stop acting like you're cool!
- Don't act like you're cool!

119
00:06:08,417 --> 00:06:11,581
[Being humiliated from trying to
act debonair.]

120
00:06:12,578 --> 00:06:14,261
[Since everyone is here...]

121
00:06:14,262 --> 00:06:17,025
<i>I will explain today's mission to you.</i>

122
00:06:17,026 --> 00:06:19,730
<i>As I have told you earlier,
today's mission is</i>

123
00:06:19,731 --> 00:06:22,421
<i>'Pairs- I want to become Monday Couple too'.</i>

124
00:06:23,692 --> 00:06:28,751
<i>Those who win first place for each mission,
will be given the opportunity for a date.</i>

125
00:06:29,251 --> 00:06:32,424
<i>And after the date goes well,
and you two have become friendly</i>

126
00:06:32,425 --> 00:06:34,946
<i>if the male is chosen as a partner at
the final location, then you win.</i>

127
00:06:35,365 --> 00:06:38,879
<i>Winning the chances at a date by
winning each mission</i>

128
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,417
<i>gives you that much better chance
at becoming the final couple.</i>

129
00:06:41,417 --> 00:06:45,313
But with Ji Hyo... it's pretty much already
decided who her partner is going to be.

130
00:06:45,314 --> 00:06:47,261
So it's not fair to do it like that.

131
00:06:47,262 --> 00:06:49,221
- Am I going to win today?
- Seriously...

132
00:06:49,222 --> 00:06:51,845
You have no idea if
I'm going to pick you or not.

133
00:06:51,846 --> 00:06:54,074
What a joke. I know you're
reminiscing about us right now.

134
00:06:56,097 --> 00:06:58,571
How would you know if I am or not?

135
00:06:58,572 --> 00:07:00,397
You lost weight so that
you could look better for me.

136
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:03,045
[The tight relationship between the two
even with the change in season.]

137
00:07:03,046 --> 00:07:07,277
<i>Before we get started on the missions,
why don't you introduce yourselves first?</i>

138
00:07:07,277 --> 00:07:10,239
<i>Starting with Male number one,
please introduce yourself.</i>

139
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,345
<i>And if there are things you two are curious
about each other, you may ask questions.</i>

140
00:07:13,346 --> 00:07:14,386
[Male number one - Yoo Jae Suk]

141
00:07:14,781 --> 00:07:21,451
Hello. I work at a broadcasting company,
and my name is Yoo Jae Suk.

142
00:07:21,451 --> 00:07:23,498
I'm in the field of broadcasting...

143
00:07:24,081 --> 00:07:28,245
and it's been about 20 years
since I've first made my appearance.

144
00:07:28,766 --> 00:07:30,421
Then how old does that make you?

145
00:07:32,583 --> 00:07:35,247
I got started in this field
when I was ten years old.

146
00:07:35,929 --> 00:07:39,412
I'm not really that old, and I...

147
00:07:39,413 --> 00:07:41,727
Then considering your age,
you have such an old looking face.

148
00:07:44,227 --> 00:07:48,798
- Lady number two...
- I'm finished. Male number two, please?

149
00:07:48,799 --> 00:07:51,926
- Will you please stop?
- Male number two please.

150
00:07:51,927 --> 00:07:54,999
[Male number one vs. Lady number two.
A mental battle right from the start.]

151
00:07:55,517 --> 00:07:58,017
We're all set!
Number two, please step up!

152
00:07:58,018 --> 00:08:00,326
- Number two...
- What a joke!

153
00:08:00,327 --> 00:08:02,089
Seriously... what a joke!

154
00:08:03,209 --> 00:08:05,471
[Male number two with the big nose.]

155
00:08:05,471 --> 00:08:08,022
- I'm Male number two.
- How old are you?

156
00:08:08,023 --> 00:08:10,412
Um... I'm 47 years old.

157
00:08:12,078 --> 00:08:15,623
There's only three years
of difference with my Mom...

158
00:08:15,624 --> 00:08:19,012
Isn't your mother younger?
She's younger than him, right?

159
00:08:19,013 --> 00:08:21,006
- No, my mother is 50...
- She's 50 years old?

160
00:08:21,394 --> 00:08:24,603
If you do the seven degrees of separation,
she's probably someone I know very well.

161
00:08:24,604 --> 00:08:28,698
Anyways, I hope to make
some nice memories today...

162
00:08:28,698 --> 00:08:32,265
[Prized male, Male number three.]

163
00:08:33,657 --> 00:08:35,510
It's Moon Geun Young's boyfriend!

164
00:08:35,511 --> 00:08:38,358
Oh, that's right... I saw that last week...

165
00:08:38,359 --> 00:08:40,160
What are you doing? Seriously...

166
00:08:40,592 --> 00:08:43,458
He's already forgotten her.
It's only been a week...

167
00:08:43,459 --> 00:08:45,840
[Very seriously starting to
introduce himself.]

168
00:08:47,374 --> 00:08:50,444
He's rumored to be linked to
Yoon Eun Hye and Moon Geun Young!

169
00:08:51,793 --> 00:08:55,776
[Male number one specializing in
having multiple relationships?]

170
00:08:58,436 --> 00:09:01,036
Actually, I'm a singer.

171
00:09:01,037 --> 00:09:05,886
So the title for my current album is
'All the men are alike'.

172
00:09:07,112 --> 00:09:10,749
But I'm not that kind of a man,
I'm a man of sincerity.

173
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:15,830
On this show, Running Man,
there are a lot of games that we play.

174
00:09:15,831 --> 00:09:19,292
I would like to become your partner
so that I can win all the games for you.

175
00:09:19,293 --> 00:09:23,083
And Male number three...
I think his shirt is too small for him.

176
00:09:23,535 --> 00:09:25,556
- It bothers me.
- Does it?

177
00:09:25,557 --> 00:09:27,819
I can see huge chunk of skin
on his chest.

178
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:29,321
Does it...

179
00:09:29,321 --> 00:09:31,689
He says to Ji Hyo, 'Does it'?

180
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:35,444
Why are you being so polite?
Why are you being so polite?

181
00:09:35,445 --> 00:09:38,337
<i>Why are you being so polite?
You want to become a couple that badly?</i>

182
00:09:38,781 --> 00:09:40,609
I'm just wearing it for a moment
because it's cold outside.

183
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:43,357
I will... change out of it later.

184
00:09:43,637 --> 00:09:45,219
Please step back into your spot!

185
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:47,171
Why are you walking like that?

186
00:09:48,569 --> 00:09:51,551
Hello. I'm...

187
00:09:51,552 --> 00:09:54,113
I'm... a flake.

188
00:09:54,114 --> 00:09:56,049
[Male number four is a flake?]

189
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:58,061
My specialty is being a trouble maker.

190
00:09:58,633 --> 00:10:02,493
And to be honest...
I want to cause some trouble today.

191
00:10:02,986 --> 00:10:04,965
Who is it?
Who do you have your eye on?

192
00:10:07,247 --> 00:10:09,542
Number two...

193
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:15,070
[Male number four in the clear?]

194
00:10:15,071 --> 00:10:17,139
Seriously... next person, please.

195
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:20,525
Congratulations on your
upcoming wedding!

196
00:10:20,965 --> 00:10:23,737
[Male number five
is facing his upcoming wedding.]

197
00:10:23,738 --> 00:10:25,891
And today is his fiancé's birthday!

198
00:10:25,892 --> 00:10:28,001
[And on top of that, the day
of the recording is her birthday!]

199
00:10:35,703 --> 00:10:38,796
[Male number five, please be happy.]

200
00:10:38,797 --> 00:10:41,223
- Be happy!
- Wish your fiancé a happy birthday.

201
00:10:42,026 --> 00:10:45,011
Once the camera starts rolling,
I no longer know who that woman is!

202
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:49,240
There's something that I have to do today.
It's to give you ladies my love.

203
00:10:51,402 --> 00:10:53,195
I really hope that you choose me.

204
00:10:53,196 --> 00:10:55,441
Lady number one... I love you!

205
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,669
You've just shown me way too much.

206
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:01,305
Is this your birthday gift to her?

207
00:11:02,644 --> 00:11:05,043
[I'm sorry... you're the only one for me.]

208
00:11:05,044 --> 00:11:06,997
Hello, I'm Male number six.

209
00:11:06,998 --> 00:11:11,190
- More than anything, I sincerely...
- Song Joong Ki's friend!

210
00:11:11,191 --> 00:11:12,492
<i>Song Joong Ki's best friend!</i>

211
00:11:12,493 --> 00:11:15,818
[Male number six is Song Joong Ki's friend.]

212
00:11:17,453 --> 00:11:19,753
I really like Song Joong Ki!

213
00:11:19,754 --> 00:11:22,309
- Where is Song Joong Ki?
- Seriously!

214
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:25,345
[Male number six doesn't like it when
the subject of his friend is brought up.]

215
00:11:25,346 --> 00:11:27,427
- Don't talk about Song Joong Ki!
- Song Joong Ki!

216
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:31,484
Once you start looking, you'll see that I have
many more better qualities than Joong Ki.

217
00:11:31,898 --> 00:11:33,902
Please be on the watch for that.

218
00:11:33,903 --> 00:11:37,358
Male number one told us earlier...
that there's nothing to see with you.

219
00:11:38,971 --> 00:11:41,667
Aren't Ladies number one and two
going to introduce themselves?

220
00:11:42,491 --> 00:11:45,651
Hello...
[Lady number one introducing herself.]

221
00:11:46,195 --> 00:11:48,672
[A strong reaction.]

222
00:11:48,673 --> 00:11:53,681
Thank you, I'm Lady number one,
and my name is Park Bo Young.

223
00:11:53,682 --> 00:11:55,061
[Lady number one's name is
Park Bo Young.]

224
00:11:55,062 --> 00:11:57,463
- Young! Young!
- You're so pretty!

225
00:11:57,464 --> 00:12:00,733
I met all of you before just briefly...

226
00:12:00,734 --> 00:12:08,013
but I wanted to see you all again and get to
know all of you better, so I came on the show.

227
00:12:08,014 --> 00:12:10,162
We're so glad that you're here!

228
00:12:10,163 --> 00:12:13,568
Yes, I will give it my best today.
Thank you.

229
00:12:14,661 --> 00:12:16,757
[Breaking out in a cheer.]

230
00:12:16,758 --> 00:12:19,603
Yes, I'm Lady number two.

231
00:12:19,604 --> 00:12:21,124
You really are shameless.

232
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:26,008
I will never choose number six.

233
00:12:27,609 --> 00:12:29,477
Even though I've been with you all
for the past two years...

234
00:12:29,478 --> 00:12:33,531
I will put my best effort in with
the intent of getting to know you better.

235
00:12:33,532 --> 00:12:35,456
I don't know if this is the
right thing to say from the get go...

236
00:12:35,456 --> 00:12:37,911
but it seems like Lady number two
has a bit of an attitude problem.

237
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:40,382
I will also not be picking Male number one.

238
00:12:40,383 --> 00:12:42,739
- I will never pick him.
- Do you like clubs?

239
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:44,382
Yes, I like clubs.

240
00:12:44,383 --> 00:12:46,267
- Yes...
- I like clubs too!

241
00:12:46,268 --> 00:12:48,137
See? I like it too!

242
00:12:49,046 --> 00:12:51,556
[At that point...
they were only full of happiness...]

243
00:12:52,794 --> 00:12:55,877
[Changing into their outfits.]

244
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:58,819
He has interest in Lady number one.

245
00:12:58,819 --> 00:13:01,878
[Full of nervous energy even
while they change their clothes.]

246
00:13:03,174 --> 00:13:06,271
[Six men vs. Two women]

247
00:13:10,022 --> 00:13:12,437
[Checking his style before
the interview starts?]

248
00:13:13,416 --> 00:13:16,556
Lady number two is...
which Male was it?

249
00:13:16,557 --> 00:13:20,463
Is it number four? I think
there was something between them.

250
00:13:20,464 --> 00:13:23,236
Is it okay for people who have
a past to be on the show together?

251
00:13:25,071 --> 00:13:26,610
I don't know...

252
00:13:27,029 --> 00:13:30,705
but I like Lady number two
who showed off a bit of an attitude.

253
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:36,280
[Male number four is taking care
of Lady number two.]

254
00:13:41,294 --> 00:13:42,976
I'm not really sure yet.

255
00:13:42,977 --> 00:13:47,761
I think Male number one is
going to be very caring...

256
00:13:47,762 --> 00:13:50,583
but it bothers me that he has a child.

257
00:13:51,431 --> 00:13:53,169
[Male number one has a child.]

258
00:13:53,709 --> 00:13:56,226
And as for Male number three...

259
00:13:56,227 --> 00:13:59,683
there are other people that I'm reminded
of whenever I think about him...

260
00:14:00,384 --> 00:14:02,592
[Related search for Male number three
are all names of women.]

261
00:14:02,592 --> 00:14:05,513
So it makes me wonder if
there's even a space for me.

262
00:14:05,514 --> 00:14:08,595
And I heard that Male number five
is going to get married soon?

263
00:14:09,853 --> 00:14:13,150
And Male number six is just
too tall!

264
00:14:13,577 --> 00:14:14,953
Number one...

265
00:14:14,954 --> 00:14:17,825
Lady number is already
about 40% in love with me.

266
00:14:18,549 --> 00:14:21,886
And in case anything happens...

267
00:14:21,887 --> 00:14:25,813
I'm going to keep the door open for a
possibility with Lady number two to the end.

268
00:14:26,766 --> 00:14:28,455
As of right now...

269
00:14:29,819 --> 00:14:31,412
Lady number one?

270
00:14:35,641 --> 00:14:38,603
[I'm sure you're all flying high
on cloud nine right now...]

271
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:43,178
[Yeah... enjoy and have fun...]

272
00:14:45,068 --> 00:14:47,493
[Because soon enough, it's going
to get hard to even just breathe.]

273
00:14:49,734 --> 00:14:51,776
[Do you want to know who I am?]

274
00:14:52,498 --> 00:14:55,561
[Soon you'll find out...]

275
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:05,458
<i>Okay... everyone's all gathered now?</i>

276
00:15:05,459 --> 00:15:06,498
Yes!

277
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:12,991
<i>First up is 'Doshirak Corner' where you can
share a Doshirak with someone you like.</i>

278
00:15:14,198 --> 00:15:16,419
<i>You'll notice there's
a convenience store to your right.</i>

279
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:21,130
<i>Go to the convenience store and
buy whatever you each would like to eat.</i>

280
00:15:24,917 --> 00:15:27,520
- Number one... what are you going to eat?
- Yes?

281
00:15:27,521 --> 00:15:29,090
Number two,
please be careful of the steps.

282
00:15:29,091 --> 00:15:32,410
[All the men are being considerate in
order to buy the women's hearts.]

283
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:36,206
Thank you. You're very caring.

284
00:15:39,629 --> 00:15:41,730
- The employee here...
- You work here now?

285
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:44,126
[Dong Wan PD working his shift
at the convenience store.]

286
00:15:44,943 --> 00:15:46,349
- Hello...
- What are you going to eat?

287
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:49,021
- I'm not really sure.
- Number two, what do you like to eat?

288
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,164
What should I eat?

289
00:15:51,165 --> 00:15:53,141
- I'm going to get some steamed buns...
- Steamed buns are really good!

290
00:15:54,381 --> 00:15:57,526
[Surprised by the hot steam
that shot out of the bun steamer.]

291
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,951
- Gary, come here.
- Why?

292
00:16:00,949 --> 00:16:02,975
- Stand here.
- Open up the door.

293
00:16:05,915 --> 00:16:08,325
Ugh! That's hot! That was hot!

294
00:16:08,325 --> 00:16:10,139
Don't buy any steamed buns.
I already got one for you.

295
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:11,839
- Seriously...
- Do you like fish cakes?

296
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:15,268
The competition is way too cutthroat since
there are so few ladies on the show today.

297
00:16:15,269 --> 00:16:16,896
Aren't you going to eat anything?

298
00:16:16,897 --> 00:16:20,136
All the men are buying the food...
so there's no need for me to buy anything.

299
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,839
- I think you probably need to buy some!
- Forget it!

300
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:25,608
- I'm not going to eat any of yours.
- I didn't buy anything for you.

301
00:16:25,609 --> 00:16:28,990
- Forget it! Don't even talk to me.
- Seriously...

302
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:30,578
I'm not even considering
Lady number two.

303
00:16:30,579 --> 00:16:33,947
I'm not sure how this is going to sound,
but she just seems so cold.

304
00:16:35,803 --> 00:16:37,638
[Lady number two heading
to her spot.]

305
00:16:43,772 --> 00:16:45,364
<i>What did you buy?</i>

306
00:16:45,365 --> 00:16:46,388
I...

307
00:16:47,451 --> 00:16:49,844
[Merely two americano coffees?]

308
00:16:50,296 --> 00:16:53,275
Aren't the men supposed to
prepare the food?

309
00:16:53,681 --> 00:16:55,513
Why would I have to prepare
that myself?

310
00:16:57,397 --> 00:17:00,800
[The men getting the meal prepared.]

311
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:02,610
This is awesome.

312
00:17:03,772 --> 00:17:04,910
What is this?

313
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:09,318
- This looks really good.
- I want to have one right now.

314
00:17:11,518 --> 00:17:13,903
<i>Lady number one, over here!</i>

315
00:17:14,361 --> 00:17:17,582
You can sit over there,
and I'll sit over here.

316
00:17:17,583 --> 00:17:22,503
- I can't eat with you?
- We have all the men.

317
00:17:23,944 --> 00:17:25,831
Lady number two...

318
00:17:25,832 --> 00:17:27,673
[All the men making their way over.]

319
00:17:27,674 --> 00:17:29,537
Stop over here.
Where are you both going?

320
00:17:29,538 --> 00:17:32,186
[Sitting down right away?]

321
00:17:32,187 --> 00:17:34,777
<i>You have to go stand in front
of the sign.</i>

322
00:17:34,778 --> 00:17:37,561
[Have to choose first...]

323
00:17:40,455 --> 00:17:41,810
Popcorn?

324
00:17:43,343 --> 00:17:46,805
[Male number two bought popcorn.]

325
00:17:46,806 --> 00:17:50,451
There's the pleasure of sharing
the same tub.

326
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:55,357
Male number two... hurry up!

327
00:17:55,849 --> 00:17:57,888
<i>You can be disqualified.
10 seconds!</i>

328
00:17:58,557 --> 00:17:59,975
Disqualified.

329
00:17:59,976 --> 00:18:02,692
- Male number two... out.
- Is he disqualified?

330
00:18:02,693 --> 00:18:04,828
I'm so sick of hearing the word, out.

331
00:18:04,829 --> 00:18:08,653
- How many years have I heard that for?

in search for Kim Jong Kook from now on.

495
00:29:22,755 --> 00:29:25,595
- She's going to pop up in the search too!
- Wait... why are you being like this?

496
00:29:25,596 --> 00:29:27,417
You're surrounding yourself
with women, aren't you?

497
00:29:27,418 --> 00:29:29,558
What did you say? Why are you...

498
00:29:30,763 --> 00:29:33,742
[While they're all immersed
in the couples' game...]

499
00:29:37,266 --> 00:29:42,641
[Somewhere in the woods nearby...]

500
00:29:42,641 --> 00:29:45,212
[A suspicious shadow?]

501
00:29:45,213 --> 00:29:47,455
- Okay, okay...
- There's much we can learn here.

502
00:29:49,415 --> 00:29:56,371
[What is the reason for him being here?]

503
00:29:56,371 --> 00:29:59,656
[Then he...]

504
00:29:59,657 --> 00:30:02,499
[Makes a move?]

505
00:30:04,246 --> 00:30:10,066
[While everyone remains oblivious...]

506
00:30:10,067 --> 00:30:12,287
[Moving in on them?]

507
00:30:13,202 --> 00:30:15,569
Don't relax too much.
You never know when things will change.

508
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:22,154
[What he's after...]

509
00:30:22,154 --> 00:30:25,883
[Is what? The staff?]

510
00:30:30,515 --> 00:30:32,457
[One staff member being dragged away.]

511
00:30:33,471 --> 00:30:36,060
[And he is... Jae Suk's VJ, Gwon Yeol?]

512
00:30:38,689 --> 00:30:40,077
<i>Don't yell out anything.</i>

513
00:30:41,215 --> 00:30:45,379
[Just why is he kidnapping Gwon Yeol?]

514
00:30:47,005 --> 00:30:48,033
<i>Go!</i>

515
00:30:50,235 --> 00:30:54,963
[Just where is he taking Gwon Yeol?]

516
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:04,782
[While no one's noticed anything,
and after Gwon Yeol has disappeared...]

517
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:09,585
[Male number one and Male number four
battling for Lady number two.]

518
00:31:09,585 --> 00:31:12,456
- He's really a manly man...
- What a manly man!

519
00:31:13,169 --> 00:31:16,321
[Male number four
definitively making his mark.]

520
00:31:16,322 --> 00:31:18,110
I know that this is what she's
going to do!

521
00:31:19,604 --> 00:31:22,011
- Will my umbrella... what are you doing?
- Will my umbrella...

522
00:31:22,865 --> 00:31:24,061
What are you doing right now?

523
00:31:25,809 --> 00:31:29,154
[During the scrimmage,
Lady number two's sticker falls off.]

524
00:31:29,155 --> 00:31:30,642
Your mate is right here!

525
00:31:34,149 --> 00:31:38,249
[Male number one vs. Male number four-
Lady number two's selection is...]

526
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:39,822
Don't you think Male number one
looks a bit pitiful?

527
00:31:39,823 --> 00:31:42,096
I didn't want to make you feel burdened
by telling you this...

528
00:31:42,097 --> 00:31:44,328
- But the truth is...
- If you feel burdened, just go!

529
00:31:45,914 --> 00:31:49,156
[Male number one was
refused by Lady number two.]

530
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:50,332
Come over here...

531
00:31:50,333 --> 00:31:52,435
Jae Suk, come over here.

532
00:31:53,705 --> 00:31:56,395
Seriously... this is unbelievable!

533
00:31:58,683 --> 00:32:00,398
This is seriously unbelievable.

534
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:02,672
What is your deal?

535
00:32:02,673 --> 00:32:04,840
[Couples have been decided.]

536
00:32:04,841 --> 00:32:08,057
[Aboard the camper and head to
the pre-determined camping site.]

537
00:32:12,925 --> 00:32:15,070
Why don't you get on first?

538
00:32:16,134 --> 00:32:18,811
- Does this have second floor?
- Yeah, it's two story.

539
00:32:23,355 --> 00:32:25,959
Male number one,
you're not hurt, are you?

540
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:28,963
- I'm much cooler than I look.
- Are you?

541
00:32:28,963 --> 00:32:32,354
To be honest... I don't really like you.

542
00:32:32,939 --> 00:32:37,770
I know that...
you really are a catty man!

543
00:32:37,771 --> 00:32:39,598
What do you mean, catty?
What about me is catty?

544
00:32:39,599 --> 00:32:42,472
[Camper leisurely heading on its way.]

545
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:48,306
[But... could that person possibly be...]

546
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:52,070
I kept these hidden...

547
00:32:52,071 --> 00:32:56,268
[Lady number one pulling out
the sausages she had kept hidden.]

548
00:32:58,637 --> 00:33:00,498
Male number three,
you don't eat that kind of stuff though.

549
00:33:00,499 --> 00:33:02,578
- Male number three doesn't eat that stuff.
- I do eat it!

550
00:33:02,579 --> 00:33:04,618
You can just hold onto it then.

551
00:33:06,294 --> 00:33:09,422
[The remaining men can't even stand
the sight of the two couples.]

552
00:33:09,423 --> 00:33:12,002
I want to treasure this...
it's a keepsake for me.

553
00:33:12,003 --> 00:33:13,918
- It's our first meeting's...
- We can share it.

554
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:17,756
[The day just keeps on getting darker
while they're getting along harmoniously...]

555
00:33:17,756 --> 00:33:23,961
[In truth, their way to Aejung campground
was being led by someone up front...]

556
00:33:26,261 --> 00:33:28,336
[Aejung Camping Ground]

557
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:30,952
<i>We're here!</i>

558
00:33:36,066 --> 00:33:39,887
[Yes, we are here...]

559
00:33:42,466 --> 00:33:45,365
- Let me get off first.
- What is all this?

560
00:33:46,910 --> 00:33:49,058
- What is it?
- It's a barbeque.

561
00:33:49,059 --> 00:33:51,913
[Outdoor barbeque that's been
prepared for them at Aejung campground.]

562
00:33:51,914 --> 00:33:55,888
[However, only the couple are
permitted to enjoy the delicious meal.]

563
00:33:55,888 --> 00:33:59,331
But why do they keep feeding us?
It's making me nervous.

564
00:33:59,332 --> 00:34:02,836
I'm sorry to be eating all this beef
by ourselves over here.

565
00:34:02,837 --> 00:34:05,590
This is going to cook up real fast,
so we're going to have to eat quickly.

566
00:34:07,157 --> 00:34:09,431
- Wow... look at this.
- Just smell this stuff!

567
00:34:09,432 --> 00:34:10,581
What do we do with all this?

568
00:34:10,581 --> 00:34:14,916
But I think the best part of it all is
being able to eat this stuff outdoors.

569
00:34:14,917 --> 00:34:17,290
- The smell of charcoal...
- That looks so good.

570
00:34:18,928 --> 00:34:20,358
I can smell the meat cooking.

571
00:34:21,014 --> 00:34:25,081
- Here, why don't you try this?
- What are you doing right now?

572
00:34:25,671 --> 00:34:28,152
- Please don't be like that!
- You two aren't an official couple yet!

573
00:34:28,153 --> 00:34:30,869
- You don't need to be doing all that...
- Well, he's grilling right now...

574
00:34:30,870 --> 00:34:32,841
- What are you doing?
- It's because she's very kind.

575
00:34:32,841 --> 00:34:34,157
Since he's grilling...

576
00:34:34,158 --> 00:34:35,675
- Here, take a bite.
- Thank you.

577
00:34:39,541 --> 00:34:42,659
- That's about to burn...
- But there's no need for you to feed him...

578
00:34:43,752 --> 00:34:46,152
[Male number four trying to feed
his lady a lettuce wrap.]

579
00:34:49,891 --> 00:34:51,933
What are you two doing?

580
00:34:51,934 --> 00:34:53,915
It's because I'm so happy
to be with her again.

581
00:34:54,859 --> 00:34:56,861
You two really are
out here camping, aren't you?

582
00:34:57,355 --> 00:34:59,812
- How many garlic pieces did you put in here?
- Four!

583
00:35:00,775 --> 00:35:03,633
I put four pieces of garlic in there.
It's so that you become more human...

584
00:35:04,241 --> 00:35:05,727
So that you can become more lady-like!

585
00:35:05,728 --> 00:35:08,706
[Monday couple from the past.]

586
00:35:09,868 --> 00:35:13,450
<i>I will give you your second mission with
a chance at a date as the prize.</i>

587
00:35:14,463 --> 00:35:17,345
<i>Lady number one and Lady number two</i>

588
00:35:17,345 --> 00:35:20,416
<i>will draw a piece of paper
with the tent number on it</i>

589
00:35:20,417 --> 00:35:24,142
<i>and will go wait inside the tent
that they have drawn.</i>

590
00:35:24,753 --> 00:35:31,099
<i>If the men finds a tent with a lady inside,
and they're together, they'll become a couple.</i>

591
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:32,429
- So this is all by chance?
- Yes.

592
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:35,031
<i>And they will go on with the mission
as instructed at that point.</i>

593
00:35:35,032 --> 00:35:39,690
<i>Please draw a piece of paper
which has the tent number written on it.</i>

594
00:35:39,691 --> 00:35:41,291
<i>Please step up to the front.</i>

595
00:35:42,696 --> 00:35:44,462
Ji Hyo, I'll see you later.

596
00:35:44,463 --> 00:35:47,156
- Ji Hyo, see you later.
- Okay, I'll see you later.

597
00:35:47,807 --> 00:35:50,488
[The ideal opportunity
to change up the couples!]

598
00:35:50,489 --> 00:35:51,875
We'll see the two of you later.

599
00:35:51,876 --> 00:35:53,742
Please wait just a little while.

600
00:35:53,743 --> 00:35:55,450
- I will make sure to come...
- This is all pre-destined.

601
00:35:55,451 --> 00:35:57,109
I will come to where you are.

602
00:35:57,593 --> 00:35:59,380
- Yes.
- No matter where that may be...

603
00:36:00,928 --> 00:36:03,972
[Lady one and Lady two getting
a head start.]

604
00:36:03,972 --> 00:36:07,455
[Does fate means that it'll allow
them to see each other again?]

605
00:36:09,271 --> 00:36:13,206
[Soon after, all the men start out to
meet up with Ladies number one and two.]

606
00:36:17,233 --> 00:36:18,988
Wait... you're not Gwon Yeol.

607
00:36:21,007 --> 00:36:22,352
Where did Gwon Yeol go?

608
00:36:22,353 --> 00:36:25,613
- I don't really know.
- Seriously... what are you talking about?

609
00:36:27,942 --> 00:36:29,833
Lady number one...

610
00:36:30,348 --> 00:36:33,110
Lady number one, are you in here?
Lady number one?

611
00:36:35,265 --> 00:36:36,444
There's no one in here.

612
00:36:38,159 --> 00:36:40,530
Who could be in here?

613
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:43,289
[Every tent that they open
is completely empty.]

614
00:36:45,704 --> 00:36:47,050
Not in here either.

615
00:36:47,051 --> 00:36:48,752
It's not this one.

616
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,372
Lady number one?

617
00:36:52,428 --> 00:36:54,258
If not, Lady number two?

618
00:36:56,227 --> 00:36:59,661
[But they seem to have
completely disappeared?]

619
00:36:59,662 --> 00:37:02,312
Lady number one? There's a table in here.
Wait a minute...

620
00:37:05,296 --> 00:37:06,412
What is this?

621
00:37:10,784 --> 00:37:16,473
<i>[You didn't become part of a couple.
Please return to base camp.]</i>

622
00:37:19,018 --> 00:37:20,749
Are you making me to be a spy again?

623
00:37:24,384 --> 00:37:26,353
Come on... seriously...

624
00:37:27,965 --> 00:37:31,132
<i>[You didn't become part of a couple.
Please return to base camp.]</i>

625
00:37:31,133 --> 00:37:34,712
Tragedy! Tragedy!

626
00:37:38,207 --> 00:37:40,177
Is no one coming?

627
00:37:43,501 --> 00:37:45,824
I wonder if Lady number one didn't get
coupled off with anyone either?

628
00:37:46,623 --> 00:37:49,828
<i>[You didn't become part of a couple.
Please return to base camp.]</i>

629

[Someone's shadow...]

630
00:38:10,655 --> 00:38:14,622
[The same shadow near the other tents too?]

631
00:38:15,326 --> 00:38:16,727
Lady number one?

632
00:38:19,132 --> 00:38:20,728
Who are you?

633
00:38:23,992 --> 00:38:26,069
He's leaving... excuse me!

634
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:28,180
Answer me if you're a woman,
but go away if you're a man!

635
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:36,424
Who are you...

636
00:38:39,534 --> 00:38:42,350
[The suspicious shadow
casting on the tents...]

637
00:38:42,831 --> 00:38:46,235
[The identity of that is?]

638

[From disappointment of not becoming a part
of a couple, Haroro is trying to leave...]

639

[But someone was waiting for him
right out front!]

640
00:39:00,278 --> 00:39:02,626
[A terrifying invasion!]

641
00:39:09,949 --> 00:39:13,880
[Who is this intruder that
overpowers Ha Ha within moments?]

642
00:39:32,052 --> 00:39:36,325
[Just what is...]

643
00:39:42,426 --> 00:39:47,652
[Disappearing into the woods after
capturing Ha Ha... Just who is that man?]

644
00:39:54,767 --> 00:39:57,672
- I don't see Ha Ha here.
- You think Ha Ha became a couple?

645
00:39:58,242 --> 00:40:01,193
Then does that mean... does it mean
Ha Ha and Bo Young are a couple?

646
00:40:02,279 --> 00:40:04,572
I should be protecting Lady number one
in this dangerous darkness.

647
00:40:04,573 --> 00:40:08,144
- I really was going to watch over her.
- You can just keep your mouth shut.

648
00:40:08,612 --> 00:40:11,318
- Bo Young was just playing with you.
- Stop with your lame jokes!

649
00:40:12,350 --> 00:40:15,158
- Where have you been, Lady number two?
- Any of you become a couple?

650
00:40:15,159 --> 00:40:17,950
- No, we haven't.
- Lady number one isn't back yet though.

651
00:40:17,951 --> 00:40:19,592
What is that?

652
00:40:20,567 --> 00:40:22,125
<i>What is that?</i>

653
00:40:22,126 --> 00:40:24,661
<i>[Couple off in two's (Temporary coupling)
and set off on your mission!]</i>

654

<i>[Jae Suk - Jong Kook; Suk Jin- Kwang Soo;
Gary- Ji Hyo.]</i>

658
00:40:40,379 --> 00:40:43,670
[Without even any explanations...
where is this coming from?]

659
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:46,930
<i>[All couples must make sure to move
with their arms linked together.]</i>

660
00:40:46,931 --> 00:40:49,671
- You mean, us two?
- You want us to link arms?

661
00:40:49,672 --> 00:40:51,978
- What is this now?
- Link our arms?

662
00:40:53,312 --> 00:40:56,337
- Why do you want us to link our arms?
- I'm so sick of this stuff.

663
00:40:56,338 --> 00:40:58,671
You want me to link my arm with yours?

664
00:40:59,276 --> 00:41:01,446
Here, link your arm in mine.

665
00:41:01,447 --> 00:41:03,625
[The Easy Brothers' couple
is the first to get on their way!]

666
00:41:03,626 --> 00:41:05,850
- Do you know what this is about?
- No, I don't know.

667
00:41:05,851 --> 00:41:10,684
[Not having a clue as to what's going on.]

668
00:41:10,684 --> 00:41:12,012
I'm going to couple up with her
no matter what.

669
00:41:12,012 --> 00:41:13,920
Is that still even within play?

670
00:41:13,921 --> 00:41:16,585
Of course. The last ones to remain
a couple are the winners.

671
00:41:16,586 --> 00:41:18,604
I liked Lady number one too.

672
00:41:21,512 --> 00:41:24,770
- This is how all the horror movies start.
- I know...

673
00:41:24,770 --> 00:41:29,984
With all the couples out for some fun,
they start getting picked off one by one...

674
00:41:29,985 --> 00:41:31,938
and some scary stuff starts to happen.

675
00:41:32,432 --> 00:41:35,226
And the couples start to
disappear one by one.

676
00:41:44,397 --> 00:41:46,326
You scared me!

677
00:41:46,327 --> 00:41:47,997
You really scared me!

678
00:41:47,997 --> 00:41:50,159
I see that you are still more fearful
than you let on.

679
00:41:51,413 --> 00:41:52,906
My nose is running...

680
00:41:54,851 --> 00:41:59,515
[They've arrived where they were instructed,
but where is the mission card?]

681
00:41:59,516 --> 00:42:02,493
You think there's something going on
with the other couple?

682
00:42:03,485 --> 00:42:06,813
Then what are we supposed to do here?
Have a date?

683
00:42:09,411 --> 00:42:12,675
Shall we have a date?
Since it's pretty windy and chilly?

684
00:42:13,338 --> 00:42:15,793
- Color of those leaves are so beautiful!
- Where?

685
00:42:17,516 --> 00:42:18,810
What are you doing?

686
00:42:21,939 --> 00:42:23,730
What are you doing?

687
00:42:24,351 --> 00:42:25,688
Why don't you come have
a seat over here?

688
00:42:26,254 --> 00:42:30,155
[Oh my... are they
seriously starting their date?]

689
00:42:30,156 --> 00:42:31,320
Seriously...

690
00:42:31,321 --> 00:42:33,956
instead of finding
what you're supposed to be finding...

691
00:42:34,410 --> 00:42:39,521
Flashlight, flashlight...
who is the fairest of them all?

692
00:42:40,118 --> 00:42:41,498
Come on, you lie!

693
00:42:43,956 --> 00:42:45,951
But seriously... what's the mission?

694
00:42:45,952 --> 00:42:47,707
Let's hurry up and find the
mission card.

695
00:42:51,065 --> 00:42:53,593
What is that? There's a string.

696
00:42:53,594 --> 00:42:55,619
- What is this?
- Look at this... what is this?

697
00:42:57,091 --> 00:43:00,315
[What is this horizontal bar?
And what is the string for?]

698
00:43:00,897 --> 00:43:05,388
What is this? For hanging?
This is to hang something!

699
00:43:05,389 --> 00:43:08,177
This is to hang someone? What is this?

700
00:43:08,178 --> 00:43:10,554
- What is this?
- What is this?

701
00:43:10,555 --> 00:43:12,521
Look... let's take a look around.

702
00:43:13,810 --> 00:43:17,981
[Scared by the sound of wind rushing by.]

703
00:43:18,832 --> 00:43:21,376
Since it's here,
let's see what this is about.

704
00:43:22,744 --> 00:43:26,041
[And why is this standing up?]

705
00:43:26,042 --> 00:43:28,502
What... just what is this?

706
00:43:28,503 --> 00:43:30,150
Why don't you check it out?

707
00:43:30,151 --> 00:43:32,384
Just what the heck is this?
Why wouldn't I be able to kick it?

708
00:43:33,581 --> 00:43:35,862
I can just try kicking it.

709
00:43:36,938 --> 00:43:40,431
[After talking all the talk,
still not able to touch it.]

710
00:43:40,432 --> 00:43:41,913
Why can't you touch it?

711
00:43:41,914 --> 00:43:44,668
- I bet it's underneath it... it's under it!
- That's what I'm saying!

712
00:43:44,669 --> 00:43:48,046
Then why aren't you checking it out?
Just kick it like this!

713
00:43:48,666 --> 00:43:51,206
- Why aren't you checking it out?
- You try it, Jae Suk!

714
00:43:52,860 --> 00:43:55,341
[Brothers with a good relationship that
push each other when afraid?]

715
00:43:55,342 --> 00:43:58,077
Why don't you check it out?
I think the mission card is underneath it.

716
00:43:59,859 --> 00:44:01,669
- You're saying you think it's underneath it?
- Yes, I do.

717
00:44:01,670 --> 00:44:03,326
- Then why don't you push it over?
- You do it!

718
00:44:09,301 --> 00:44:11,447
[Huh? There's nothing...]

719
00:44:11,448 --> 00:44:13,087
I can't believe you pushed me.

720
00:44:13,955 --> 00:44:16,776
Either way, you did push it over.
But why isn't there anything under it?

721
00:44:16,777 --> 00:44:21,104
[But... there's nothing underneath it?]

722
00:44:24,359 --> 00:44:26,417
Excuse me!

723
00:44:26,418 --> 00:44:29,299
- You don't have a mission card, right?
- No, we don't have one!

724
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:31,213
- You don't have one?
- No, we don't.

725
00:44:31,214 --> 00:44:34,261
See? I think there's something
going on with that other couple.

726
00:44:34,262 --> 00:44:35,478
Then shall we get going?

727
00:44:36,239 --> 00:44:39,814
- Something doesn't feel right.
- I know, something feels suspicious.

728
00:44:39,815 --> 00:44:41,991
[A gloomy aura that's making them
feel uneasy.]

729
00:44:47,059 --> 00:44:50,031
[The Easy Brothers on the other hand...]

730
00:44:51,233 --> 00:44:55,891
[Searching the warehouse
that they've been sent off to.]

731
00:44:55,892 --> 00:44:56,945
Is something in there?

732
00:44:58,023 --> 00:45:01,372
[Arriving in the rest area
where a light has been left on.]

733
00:45:01,373 --> 00:45:04,890
- What is this?
- What is this place?

734
00:45:06,110 --> 00:45:08,858
There are mattresses, and things...
are we supposed to sleep here?

735
00:45:09,512 --> 00:45:11,478
[Come on... do you really think so?]

736
00:45:11,479 --> 00:45:13,378
Look over there.
Maybe there's something.

737
00:45:13,379 --> 00:45:15,496
We haven't received our mission yet.
What's the mission?

738
00:45:15,496 --> 00:45:16,932
- What is it that we're supposed to do?
- Mission?

739
00:45:16,933 --> 00:45:19,930
We need a mission card before doing anything.
I have no idea what we're supposed to do.

740
00:45:19,931 --> 00:45:22,462
[Huh? What is that card?]

741
00:45:22,463 --> 00:45:24,451
- Why are you looking at the price?
- Wow, that's cheap.

742
00:45:26,278 --> 00:45:29,546
[The light is suddenly shut off?]

743
00:45:33,506 --> 00:45:36,782
[The intruder that ousted Ha Ha?]

744
00:45:37,298 --> 00:45:38,494
Who is it?

745
00:45:45,624 --> 00:45:49,540
[He slowly approaches them!]

746
00:45:49,541 --> 00:45:53,424
[Easy Brothers in danger!
What is their fate?]

747
00:45:56,548 --> 00:46:01,339
[Running Man members set out
in search for Easy Brothers.]

748
00:46:02,013 --> 00:46:05,643
- Male number six!
- Male number two!

749
00:46:05,643 --> 00:46:08,366
- Where are you?
- Lady number one!

750
00:46:09,141 --> 00:46:10,681
Where are they?

751
00:46:10,682 --> 00:46:13,031
- Where in the world are they?
- Lady number one!

752
00:46:14,097 --> 00:46:15,813
Something feels strange...

753
00:46:15,814 --> 00:46:17,757
Something's been feeling off...

754
00:46:17,758 --> 00:46:22,117
[No mission cards to be found,
and now people are disappearing too...]

755
00:46:22,118 --> 00:46:23,588
They're nowhere to be found.

756
00:46:24,355 --> 00:46:26,765
- What is that? Giraffe... Giraffe!
- Where?

757
00:46:26,766 --> 00:46:28,383
- Giraffe!
- Hey!

758
00:46:28,384 --> 00:46:33,526
[Oh? That's Male number six...
there's the Giraffe?]

759
00:46:33,527 --> 00:46:34,808
- Male number six!
- Why is he acting like that?

760
00:46:35,924 --> 00:46:38,800
[His inexplicable expression...]

761
00:46:40,247 --> 00:46:41,816
- Male number six...
- Male number six?

762
00:46:41,817 --> 00:46:43,443
- Male number six?
- What's he doing? What's wrong with him?

763
00:46:44,231 --> 00:46:45,944
Why are you just
standing there like a mannequin?

764
00:46:48,158 --> 00:46:49,430
- What's wrong?
- What's wrong with him?

765
00:46:49,431 --> 00:46:51,760
- What's wrong with you?
- Male number six, what's wrong?

766
00:46:52,268 --> 00:46:54,415
- Come to the playground.
- What did you say?

767
00:46:55,038 --> 00:46:57,135
- Come to the playground.
- You want us to come to the playground?

768
00:47:01,898 --> 00:47:03,245
What's wrong with you?

769
00:47:03,246 --> 00:47:05,560
I told you to come to the playground.

770
00:47:05,561 --> 00:47:07,112
Why aren't you listening to me?

771
00:47:08,262 --> 00:47:12,554
[His tone of speech and expression
are as if he's under a spell...]

772
00:47:12,555 --> 00:47:14,948
Something... wait, it's like he's being
controlled by something?

773
00:47:15,449 --> 00:47:17,842
Is he being controlled by something?
Are you under some kind of a spell?

774
00:47:18,714 --> 00:47:21,608
To the playground...
run over there within one minute.

775
00:47:22,675 --> 00:47:27,136
[Should they do as they're told or not...]

776
00:47:27,137 --> 00:47:28,803
- What is this?
- Hey!

777
00:47:28,804 --> 00:47:29,907
Look, there's the playground.

778
00:47:29,907 --> 00:47:32,533
Wait... what if he's playing us
right now?

779
00:47:32,534 --> 00:47:34,489
- I don't think he is.
- You think he's playing us?

780
00:47:34,490 --> 00:47:37,481
[Suspicious to see if the Giraffe
is possibly playing a joke on them.]

781
00:47:37,481 --> 00:47:40,137
[But nothing but a mysterious expression...]

782
00:47:41,620 --> 00:47:43,783
- See? Something's strange.
- Come over here.

783
00:47:43,784 --> 00:47:45,509
- Gather at the playground.
- He wants at the playground.

784
00:47:45,509 --> 00:47:47,105
- Jae Suk, where are you going?
- Over this way!

785
00:47:47,106 --> 00:47:48,269
We can go that way too?

786
00:47:50,683 --> 00:47:53,884
[Gathering for now at the playground
as the Giraffe told them to.]

787
00:47:54,506 --> 00:47:58,131
[It's just an empty playground...]

788
00:47:58,132 --> 00:47:59,865
Did we just get played?

789
00:47:59,866 --> 00:48:03,095
Why do we have to do
as Male number six tells us to?

790
00:48:03,096 --> 00:48:04,470
Let's be honest here...

791
00:48:04,471 --> 00:48:06,476
Why are we being told to gather here?

792
00:48:07,626 --> 00:48:10,536
- Male number six!
- Male number six...

793
00:48:10,536 --> 00:48:12,028
What is this, Male number six?

794
00:48:12,719 --> 00:48:15,174
- Where are you going?
- The moon looks really strange tonight!

795
00:48:15,175 --> 00:48:18,944
- The moon looks so strange!
- Why does the moon look like that?

796
00:48:18,945 --> 00:48:20,337
Doesn't it look creepy?

797
00:48:20,338 --> 00:48:22,019
It looks like the moon
from all those scary stories.

798
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:23,575
[There's something in his ear?]

799
00:48:23,576 --> 00:48:25,355
<i>Okay, members...</i>

800
00:48:26,129 --> 00:48:27,895
<i>Face left!</i>

801
00:48:27,896 --> 00:48:30,149
All the members, face left!

802
00:48:31,075 --> 00:48:32,691
Why do we have to do as he tells us?

803
00:48:32,692 --> 00:48:33,997
<i>Members, march forward!</i>

804
00:48:33,998 --> 00:48:36,065
Members, march forward!

805
00:48:36,717 --> 00:48:40,057
[Doing as they're told for now...]

806
00:48:40,401 --> 00:48:44,247
<i>- Left, left, left...
- Halt right there!</i>

807
00:48:45,841 --> 00:48:47,297

808
00:48:51,099 --> 00:48:52,708

809
00:48:52,709 --> 00:48:55,945
<i>Grasshopper, Jong Kook, Gary and Ji Hyo.
Have you all been well?</i>

810
00:48:56,544 --> 00:48:57,809
Hello, Running Man.

811
00:48:57,810 --> 00:49:00,961
Grasshopper, Jong Kook, Gary and Ji Hyo.
Have you all been well?

812
00:49:00,962 --> 00:49:02,876
- Jae Suk, he said Grasshopper!
- Is it Min Soo?

813
00:49:02,877 --> 00:49:04,917
Min Soo is the only one who
calls you that!

814
00:49:04,918 --> 00:49:06,306
No way!

815
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:08,539
Especially...

816
00:49:09,262 --> 00:49:10,893
Jae Suk, you...

817
00:49:10,894 --> 00:49:13,373
Especially... Jae Suk, you...

818
00:49:17,034 --> 00:49:20,251
[How can this be... how can this be?]

819
00:49:23,489 --> 00:49:28,779
[Ousting him two years ago by
sticking his name tag on his back...]

820
00:49:28,779 --> 00:49:35,254
[Declaring to hunt down the Grasshopper!
His dramatic revenge last year...]

821
00:49:35,255 --> 00:49:37,462
I hate him the most.

822
00:49:37,463 --> 00:49:40,005
Min Soo... the score is one and one
right now.

823
00:49:41,187 --> 00:49:43,197
<i>The score is one and one right now.</i>

824
00:49:44,465 --> 00:49:46,562
[He's come to finish it?]

825
00:49:46,562 --> 00:49:48,065
Seriously?

826
00:49:48,066 --> 00:49:49,640
Is it Min Soo?

827
00:49:50,445 --> 00:49:52,767
After stabbing a person in the back,
and with a human mask on

828
00:49:52,768 --> 00:49:54,905
I see that you're living well
laughing the whole time.

829
00:49:56,890 --> 00:49:58,389
Kim Jong Kook, to the front!

830
00:50:01,313 --> 00:50:02,875
Take 10 steps forward.

831
00:50:02,876 --> 00:50:06,179
Look at that... that's totally Min Soo!

832
00:50:06,180 --> 00:50:07,370
Stop!

833
00:50:08,033 --> 00:50:09,269
About face.

834
00:50:20,979 --> 00:50:22,393
Now, go back.

835
00:50:24,851 --> 00:50:26,316
Go back!

836
00:50:26,317 --> 00:50:28,747
The way I see it, that could've just
been just Kwang Soo's doing.

837
00:50:28,747 --> 00:50:30,217
Go back!

838
00:50:30,218 --> 00:50:32,795
[Slapping the Tiger in the face
is an act by the Giraffe alone?]

839
00:50:32,796 --> 00:50:34,337
- I think that was just Kwang Soo...
- Go back!

840
00:50:34,338 --> 00:50:38,045
[Definitely makes sense...]

841
00:50:38,046 --> 00:50:39,803
You have to think very carefully
right now.

842
00:50:39,804 --> 00:50:42,734
- That could've been just Kwang Soo doing it!
- I think you're right.

843
00:50:43,238 --> 00:50:47,062
That wasn't on my order,
but Kwang Soo did it on his own.

844
00:50:47,063 --> 00:50:48,678
Kwang Soo, relay that
message exactly as you're told.

845
00:50:49,368 --> 00:50:52,545
That... that wasn't on my order...

846
00:50:53,158 --> 00:50:55,125
That wasn't on my order...

847
00:50:58,715 --> 00:51:00,799
- But Kwang Soo did it on his own.
- I did it on my own.

848
00:51:01,732 --> 00:51:03,068
Kim Jong Kook, stop.

849
00:51:04,196 --> 00:51:06,230
<i>And that again wasn't on my order.</i>

850
00:51:07,210 --> 00:51:09,078
And that again wasn't on my order...

851
00:51:10,116 --> 00:51:12,244
<i>And that again wasn't on my order.</i>

852
00:51:20,692 --> 00:51:24,394
[I even relay the laughter...]

853
00:51:24,395 --> 00:51:26,636
- It must be Min Soo...
- I really think it's Min Soo.

854
00:51:27,049 --> 00:51:28,617
Monday couple or whatever...

855
00:51:28,618 --> 00:51:32,484
You were all so immersed in it that
you didn't even notice that I came, did you?

856
00:51:33,914 --> 00:51:37,117
It's just the program! We have
no interest in the Monday Couple.

857
00:51:37,118 --> 00:51:39,191
- I'm okay because I have Geun Young.
- Kim Jong Kook, your mouth!

858
00:51:40,188 --> 00:51:42,305
Kim Jong Kook, your mouth!

859
00:51:43,546 --> 00:51:45,901
That was Kwang Soo...
that was totally Kwang Soo.

860
00:51:46,928 --> 00:51:49,399
<i>'Kim Jong Kook, your mouth'
wasn't something I said.</i>

861
00:51:49,869 --> 00:51:51,594
That trap of yours is your problem.

862
00:51:52,111 --> 00:51:53,990
<i>That trap of yours is your problem.</i>

863
00:51:55,792 --> 00:51:58,305
[What? Now doing what he pleases?]

864
00:52:00,112 --> 00:52:01,113
<i>Kwang Soo...</i>

865
00:52:01,113 --> 00:52:02,174
Kwang Soo...

866
00:52:02,174 --> 00:52:03,566
<i>Sit down and get back up.</i>

867
00:52:05,530 --> 00:52:07,526
<i>Do it again.</i>

868
00:52:07,527 --> 00:52:08,788
I'm sorry.

869
00:52:09,474 --> 00:52:11,209
I'm sorry.

870
00:52:12,012 --> 00:52:14,243
[The Giraffe getting punished from
doing as he wanted.]

871
00:52:14,243 --> 00:52:15,686
What a sight, you deserve it!

872
00:52:16,190 --> 00:52:17,969
<i>Okay, and now...</i>

873
00:52:18,402 --> 00:52:20,171
Okay, and now...

874
00:52:20,172 --> 00:52:23,712

'The Rose of Sharon has bloomed'.</i>

875

We're going to play,
'The Rose of Sharon has bloomed'.

876
00:52:27,207 --> 00:52:30,700
<i>The last person to play and
win this game...</i>

877
00:52:30,701 --> 00:52:33,038

win this game...

878
00:52:33,039 --> 00:52:35,238
<i>I will give them a kiss.</i>

879
00:52:35,239 --> 00:52:36,352
Excuse me?

880
00:52:36,612 --> 00:52:39,240
<i>I said, I will give them a kiss.</i>

881
00:52:39,870 --> 00:52:41,709
I will give them a kiss.

882
00:52:44,434 --> 00:52:46,858
And now... the game will start.

883
00:52:49,288 --> 00:52:52,694
The Rose of Sharon has bloomed.

884
00:53:01,657 --> 00:53:06,404
[He didn't tell them to do this
without a reason... so why?]

885

[Now...]

886
00:53:12,576 --> 00:53:15,827
[The time has come...]

887
00:53:15,828 --> 00:53:19,403
[It's been a long wait...
right, Running Man?]

888
00:53:23,435 --> 00:53:24,597

00:53:29,534 --> 00:53:31,602
- What?
- What!

- Why? What is it?
- Tell us! What is it?

894
00:53:44,279 --> 00:53:47,517
[The unseen terror...]

895
00:53:52,207 --> 00:53:54,508
[At last... coming up behind them...]

896
00:53:54,509 --> 00:53:56,055
- What is it?
- Tell us!

897
00:53:56,056 --> 00:53:58,661
[A total chaos breaks out
in their frozen state.]

898
00:53:58,662 --> 00:54:00,990
- Why?
- What's wrong?

899

[The man cloaked on mystery
getting closer and closer...]

900
00:54:11,564 --> 00:54:13,726
- Hurry...
- Tell us.

901
00:54:13,727 --> 00:54:16,328
- Is he on his way?
- Tell us... is he coming?

902
00:54:16,768 --> 00:54:19,698
- Me? Is he it?
- Hey! Kwang Soo...

903
00:54:19,699 --> 00:54:22,734
- Why? Why me? Why is he after me?
- Kwang Soo...

904
00:54:24,044 --> 00:54:28,032
[At last... it's time to meet!]

905

- What is this?
- Why? Why?

906

- What is it?
- You're both out.

907

- I'm so scared!
- What is this you've got here?

908
00:54:58,194 --> 00:55:00,916
- Okay, the game is going to keep going.
- Yes.

909
00:55:00,917 --> 00:55:03,868
- Have you been well?
- Yes, I've been well.

910
00:55:05,642 --> 00:55:07,128
Jong Kook, you're out.

911
00:55:08,398 --> 00:55:10,357
Ah, it's because I moved.

912

[Gary is the only one left!]

913

- I have to pay my respects though.
- Gary, keep going.

914
00:55:15,071 --> 00:55:16,978
Keep going.

915
00:55:18,688 --> 00:55:22,176
[How can he go on with the game
when he's scared out of his wits?]

916

[Automatically freezes over.]

917

I have to endure it... I can't move!

918

I have to endure it.
I can't move... can't move!

919

- I'm not moving!

That's scarier!

926
00:56:05,232 --> 00:56:07,368
- I'm on your side, Min Soo.
- I'm sorry.

927
00:56:08,448 --> 00:56:10,830
You have to continue with
the Rose of Sharon. Go ahead.

928

[Anyways, they have to finish
the game they started.]

are freed.]

in the playground.]

- Min Soo, what do you mean, avoid you?

939
00:56:49,801 --> 00:56:51,651
- Guard!
- Excuse me?

940
00:56:51,652 --> 00:56:53,405
Stand guard.

941
00:56:53,406 --> 00:56:55,062
Did you just tell me to stand guard?

in the midst of shadow boxing!]

I'm so scared!

That was so scary!

- You felt it too?

960

- Seriously...
- I saw his shadow.

Why did he have us playing
Rose of Sharon?

962

with this now.

- Yes, I understand.
- You got it?

01:00:14,120 --> 01:00:18,884
[Hunter having arrived first and planned
his hunting attack on the Running Men.]

992
01:00:20,117 --> 01:00:23,570
[Everything that day was to go
according to his plan!]

993
01:00:26,154 --> 01:00:28,263
If I bring them up by the camper

994
01:00:28,264 --> 01:00:32,935
the mountain is to this side
and the campsite to the other side.

995
01:00:34,060 --> 01:00:37,411
[Even the jail, monitor and walkie talkie
was planned out!]

996
01:00:38,541 --> 01:00:42,450
[Playing 'The Rose of Sharon has bloomed'
was also a part of his plan!]

997
01:00:42,451 --> 01:00:45,865
[Even the paths around
the mountain were explored!]

998
01:00:53,187 --> 01:00:56,699
[Ah, and also...]

999
01:00:56,700 --> 01:00:58,611
<i>- I've explained everything, right?
- Yes.</i>

1000
01:00:58,612 --> 01:01:02,580
That backstabbing Grasshopper
is my main goal...

1001
01:01:02,581 --> 01:01:07,238
So I guess I should tell you guys
how you can possibly win too, right?

1002
01:01:07,239 --> 01:01:10,023
[With everything planned out, explaining
a chance for Running Man to win.]

1003
01:01:10,024 --> 01:01:14,348
My name tag is scattered around
in pieces...

1004
01:01:14,349 --> 01:01:16,489
[If the Hunter's name tag which has been
scattered around in pieces are gathered...]

1005
01:01:16,489 --> 01:01:22,338
[and stuck on his back,
then that Running Man is the victor!]

1006
01:01:22,339 --> 01:01:29,354
[All of this...
is the Hunter's final secret...]

1007
01:01:29,355 --> 01:01:30,747
If you look behind you,
you're dead.

1008
01:01:35,809 --> 01:01:40,303
[The final hunt has to be fair...]

1009
01:01:44,328 --> 01:01:47,591
When we were playing
the Rose of Sharon game

1010
01:01:47,591 --> 01:01:50,526
I was going to tear off his name tag,
but it wasn't on his back.

1011
01:01:50,527 --> 01:01:51,911
- You saw it too, right?
- Min Soo?

1012
01:01:51,912 --> 01:01:54,593
- Then are we supposed to find his name tag?
- Did Kwang Soo have his name tag?

1013
01:01:54,594 --> 01:01:56,293
Then do we have to find it
and put it on his back and rip it off?

1014
01:01:56,294 --> 01:02:01,686
[These ones left remaining are slowly
starting to piece the rules together too...]

1015
01:02:01,687 --> 01:02:03,001
We're supposed to put the name tag
on him!

1016
01:02:03,002 --> 01:02:05,918
Jae Suk, we have to find his name tag.
We have to find the name tag!

1017
01:02:05,919 --> 01:02:08,393
[Not knowing that his name tag
is scattered around in pieces...]

1018
01:02:08,394 --> 01:02:10,150
You think they're insides all
those tents?

1019
01:02:12,190 --> 01:02:16,248
[On the other hand, in order to let others
know how to beat the Hunter...]

1020
01:02:18,709 --> 01:02:22,274
[Plan is to write down how to bring him
down on a paper plane and send it out.]

1021
01:02:23,191 --> 01:02:24,581
See if you can hear anything.

1022
01:02:25,449 --> 01:02:28,897
[Paper telephone, it's been awhile...]

1023
01:02:28,898 --> 01:02:31,590
- The line has to be taught.
- You're not going to get the distance.

1024
01:02:31,591 --> 01:02:33,826
The fact that he's doing something
is what's important.

1025
01:02:33,827 --> 01:02:36,407
- Hey, Dong Hoon.
- Yes, Suk Jin. I can hear you!

1026
01:02:37,793 --> 01:02:40,302
[If it can't be heard in that distance,
there's a problem...]

1027
01:02:40,303 --> 01:02:43,392
- I'm going to throw this outside, okay?
- Okay, do it.

1028
01:02:44,161 --> 01:02:45,573
I'm throwing it.

1029
01:02:50,377 --> 01:02:52,965
Look... the airplane just fell.

1030
01:02:55,545 --> 01:02:56,922
Can you get it for us just once?

1031
01:02:58,063 --> 01:02:59,827
[Get what?]

1032
01:03:00,718 --> 01:03:01,987
Sorry.

1033
01:03:04,982 --> 01:03:06,911
He's here, he's here.

1034
01:03:07,306 --> 01:03:10,924
[We're ruined...]

1035
01:03:14,123 --> 01:03:17,735
- Min Soo, I think we can be let go now.
- Let me just tell you one thing.

1036
01:03:17,736 --> 01:03:21,288
Ha Ha... you'll be in trouble
if you fly out any paper airplanes.

1037
01:03:21,869 --> 01:03:23,848
It was because I was bored.
I'm sorry!

1038
01:03:23,849 --> 01:03:26,544
Should I open up the plane
and check what it says?

1039
01:03:26,545 --> 01:03:29,738
Knowing you, I'm sure you wouldn't be
doing it without writing anything on it first.

1040
01:03:30,244 --> 01:03:37,161
And now... read the content out loud
as if you're making an announcement.

1041
01:03:37,162 --> 01:03:38,684
Begin.

1042
01:03:39,468 --> 01:03:41,480
Choi Min Soo, I love you!

1043
01:03:41,481 --> 01:03:44,266
- Min Soo, it's great to see you...
- Give it to me.

1044
01:03:44,775 --> 01:03:48,476
- Before the warmth of spring, winter comes...
- I said, give it to me.

1045
01:03:48,477 --> 01:03:50,381
I'll unlock the door and come in there.

1046
01:03:51,844 --> 01:03:55,312
- I'll give you one more chance.
- Your love that you have...

1047
01:03:55,313 --> 01:03:58,225
- Is for eternity...
- Shall I come in there?

1048
01:04:00,261 --> 01:04:02,377
[Getting rid of the evidence.]

1049
01:04:03,413 --> 01:04:06,315
- It's right... that's what he wrote.
- What he read out loud is correct.

1050
01:04:16,644 --> 01:04:19,621
<i>One, two... One, two!</i>

1051
01:04:19,622 --> 01:04:20,948
One, two.

1052
01:04:25,486 --> 01:04:29,620
[Hunter Min Soo's voice?]

1053
01:04:30,043 --> 01:04:35,412
The surviving Running Man are...
Grasshopper, Gary, Ji Hyo...

1054
01:04:35,413 --> 01:04:37,252
and Kwang Soo, the four of you.

1055
01:04:38,467 --> 01:04:41,560
<i>I have hidden four boxes
around here.</i>

1056
01:04:41,561 --> 01:04:45,856
<i>Inside those boxes are instructions
on what you have to do now...</i>

1057
01:04:45,857 --> 01:04:47,664
<i>So make sure that you each
find one.</i>

1058
01:04:48,491 --> 01:04:53,151
<i>If by any chance, any of you wastes time
and don't find one, I'll oust that person</i>

1059
01:04:53,152 --> 01:04:57,727
<i>so don't waste any time,
and make sure to get it done.</i>

1060
01:04:58,111 --> 01:04:59,927
Sir, I'm on your side!

1061
01:05:01,415 --> 01:05:03,383
I'm on your side!

1062
01:05:03,384 --> 01:05:04,943
[Giraffe put in a tough spot.]

1063
01:05:04,944 --> 01:05:06,861
What am I supposed to do here?

1064
01:05:08,488 --> 01:05:10,077
I think I need to find the box first.

1065
01:05:11,577 --> 01:05:14,880
- He said we're the only ones left.
- Then is Jong Kook out too?

1066
01:05:16,029 --> 01:05:19,059
I'd rather just get ousted early.

1067
01:05:19,060 --> 01:05:21,115
This is agonizing.

1068
01:05:21,116 --> 01:05:24,160
- Seriously...
- He said there are four boxes.

1069
01:05:24,161 --> 01:05:26,017
Where are we supposed to find
these boxes?

1070
01:05:26,018 --> 01:05:27,704
I think they're in those tents.

1071
01:05:37,602 --> 01:05:40,796
He still has a lot of resentment left
towards Jae Suk.

1072
01:05:41,560 --> 01:05:44,901
Min Soo still has a lot of resentment
left towards Jae Suk.

1073
01:05:46,167 --> 01:05:49,098
[Who is this chatterbox?]

1074
01:05:50,475 --> 01:05:54,452
[Oh...]

1075
01:05:54,452 --> 01:05:58,156
[It's Gary...]

1076
01:05:58,156 --> 01:06:01,691
[Should I go out and play?]

1077
01:06:05,772 --> 01:06:09,360
[Hunter Min Soo's chase!]

1078
01:06:16,467 --> 01:06:18,781
[Chasing right at his tail
without any difficulty!]

1079
01:06:20,482 --> 01:06:22,336
Save me! Save me!

1080
01:06:22,337 --> 01:06:26,384
[Gary out of pure desperation
begs to be saved in jail!]

1081
01:06:26,385 --> 01:06:28,536
[Panic!]

1082
01:06:28,537 --> 01:06:30,494
Please save me!

1083
01:06:31,111 --> 01:06:33,059
Please don't do this!

1084
01:06:33,467 --> 01:06:36,178
- Where is Jae Suk?
- Jae Suk?

1085
01:06:36,179 --> 01:06:37,914
He went up that way!

1086
01:06:37,915 --> 01:06:40,040
- He ran that way...
- He went that way...

1087
01:06:40,041 --> 01:06:41,694
What is going on?

1088
01:06:42,453 --> 01:06:44,578
Why is he being so scary?

1089
01:06:46,267 --> 01:06:48,930
- I'll let you go this once.
- I understand.

1090
01:06:48,931 --> 01:06:51,626
Do you know why?
It's so that I can catch you again.

1091
01:06:53,090 --> 01:06:55,527
[Where is the Hunter going now?]

1092
01:07:00,370 --> 01:07:02,274

I have to relay your messages.

1096

as my avatar correctly.

1097

No... I'm just getting started.
Please give me some time.

1098
01:07:20,833 --> 01:07:22,434
- Should I get you?
- No.

1099
01:07:22,435 --> 01:07:23,466
- Should I let you live?
- Yes.

1100

01:07:28,269 --> 01:07:31,140

- Follow me.

for the box that he's been ordered to find.]

01:08:30,200 --> 01:08:31,860
This looks like a fragment of a name tag!

1113

Wait...

1114
01:08:34,467 --> 01:08:36,240
It's Min... Min!

1115

besides this?

that Jong Kook and Jae Suk saw earlier?]

01:12:12,333 --> 01:12:15,142
Ji Hyo's not one to scream like that
over something small...

1155
01:12:16,354 --> 01:12:17,538
Ji Hyo!

1156
01:12:28,150 --> 01:12:30,810
[On the other hand...]

1157
01:12:30,811 --> 01:12:32,380
This is so hard!

1158
01:12:32,696 --> 01:12:34,415
I don't think I can endure this!

1159
01:12:34,416 --> 01:12:36,247
But if I let go, I'm finished!

1160
01:12:39,697 --> 01:12:41,380
Is anyone out there?

1161
01:12:42,748 --> 01:12:44,452
<i>Is anyone out there?</i>

1162
01:12:44,453 --> 01:12:46,795
[Giraffe's voice!]

1163
01:12:49,085 --> 01:12:50,580
Gary!

1164
01:12:51,136 --> 01:12:52,212
What happened to you?

1165
01:12:52,754 --> 01:12:54,352
Save me!

1166
01:12:56,128 --> 01:13:01,170
[If Gary hadn't come on time,
there could've been big trouble!]

1167
01:13:03,542 --> 01:13:05,022
- Calm down...
- I feel like I'm going to fall!

1168
01:13:05,023 --> 01:13:06,570
Save me!

1169
01:13:11,750 --> 01:13:13,029
I'm sorry.

1170
01:13:13,030 --> 01:13:17,364
[Afraid of getting bitten,
Gary cancels his plans to help.]

1171
01:13:17,365 --> 01:13:19,572
Gary, I won't betray you! Please!

1172
01:13:22,409 --> 01:13:23,993
I'm sorry, Kwang Soo!

1173
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:26,231
Please...

1174
01:13:26,751 --> 01:13:28,430
Jae Suk!

1175
01:13:31,731 --> 01:13:32,989
What?

1176
01:13:34,397 --> 01:13:35,751
What did you say?

1177
01:13:37,262 --> 01:13:41,025
[Kwang Soo in danger!]

1178
01:13:41,026 --> 01:13:42,603
Save me!

1179
01:13:44,120 --> 01:13:45,551
Seriously...

1180
01:13:45,552 --> 01:13:48,765
- What are you doing?
- Jae Suk, a bit faster!

1181
01:13:52,723 --> 01:13:55,361
[Kwang Soo... this is no laughing matter!]

1182
01:13:58,002 --> 01:13:59,396
Faster!

1183
01:14:18,333 --> 01:14:20,382
I'm so scared...

1184
01:14:20,383 --> 01:14:22,117
Are you out?

1185
01:14:22,518 --> 01:14:24,805
So this is what this was for?

1186
01:14:24,806 --> 01:14:26,725
This is what it was for?

1187
01:14:26,726 --> 01:14:28,859
I'm so scared!

1188
01:14:29,889 --> 01:14:31,660
Kwang Soo, what is this?

1189
01:14:31,661 --> 01:14:33,755
Jae Suk, I'm so scared.

1190
01:14:33,756 --> 01:14:36,621
[Traitor Giraffe having a mental breakdown.]

1191
01:14:36,622 --> 01:14:40,076
It says... it says he'll bite whomever
tries to save you.

1192
01:14:40,077 --> 01:14:41,671
Kwang Soo...

1193
01:14:41,672 --> 01:14:44,834
- That's what that was for?
- He's crazy!

1194
01:14:44,835 --> 01:14:47,144
[Blasting him venomously.]

1195
01:14:47,145 --> 01:14:50,320
- Where did Ji Hyo go?
- I don't know. I heard her screaming.

1196
01:14:51,504 --> 01:14:53,356
Jae Suk, just hurry up and come to jail!

1197
01:14:56,069 --> 01:14:59,424
- Seriously, I'd rather... Kwang Soo!
- Jae Suk...

1198
01:14:59,424 --> 01:15:01,295
Just tear off my name tag!

1199
01:15:01,296 --> 01:15:03,149
Jae Suk...

1200
01:15:03,764 --> 01:15:05,990
Rather than living this hell...

1201
01:15:06,507 --> 01:15:08,560
- Kwang Soo...
- You're the only one who can do this.

1202
01:15:08,561 --> 01:15:11,598
- You have to win!
- I'm seriously about to go crazy!

1203
01:15:11,599 --> 01:15:15,061
This hell! Since when has Running Man
become so scary like this?

1204
01:15:15,625 --> 01:15:17,539
This program isn't supposed to
be like this!

1205
01:15:18,816 --> 01:15:22,170
Seriously... this is unbelievable.
It's unbelievable!

1206
01:15:22,171 --> 01:15:24,507
So that's what that horizontal bar was for?

1207
01:15:31,136 --> 01:15:32,530
What do I do?

1208
01:15:32,531 --> 01:15:34,130
We're all getting ousted one by one.

1209
01:15:36,549 --> 01:15:38,325
I think this is...

1210
01:15:39,214 --> 01:15:44,197
just so that Min Soo can oust everyone
and just toy with me at the end.

1211
01:15:45,262 --> 01:15:47,122
This is seriously...

1212
01:15:47,589 --> 01:15:49,353
- Gary!
- Jae Suk!

1213
01:15:50,064 --> 01:15:52,799
- Everyone's been ousted...
- Jae Suk!

1214
01:15:53,305 --> 01:15:55,840
- Why are we back here?
- That's what I'm saying...

1215
01:15:55,841 --> 01:15:58,866
Ji Hyo's been ousted
and Kwang Soo's been ousted too...

1216
01:15:59,264 --> 01:16:01,184
- In my opinion...
- Yeah?

1217
01:16:01,185 --> 01:16:05,612
I think Min Soo...
wants to battle with you.

1218
01:16:06,282 --> 01:16:08,649
Since I don't know what'll happen,
I'll give you this now.

1219
01:16:08,650 --> 01:16:12,993
[Gary giving the Hunter's name tag
fragment that he found to Jae Suk.]

1220
01:16:13,917 --> 01:16:16,168
I think this is the end.

1221
01:16:16,169 --> 01:16:20,139
I think this is the end of your
fate with Min Soo.

1222
01:16:20,140 --> 01:16:22,749
Seriously, why is he being like this?

1223
01:16:22,750 --> 01:16:26,324
But why isn't this projector on
when we've been told to watch it?

1224
01:16:26,325 --> 01:16:27,910
[The order was to 'Head back to the
headquarters and watch the projector.]

1225
01:16:31,130 --> 01:16:35,396
[The Hunter is on the screen...]

1226
01:16:37,944 --> 01:16:41,310
<i>Do you know what the heaviest
thing in this world is?</i>

1227
01:16:43,556 --> 01:16:45,560
<i>It's the air...</i>

1228
01:16:45,560 --> 01:16:47,882
- The air?
- Why?

1229
01:16:47,882 --> 01:16:50,315
<i>The air that you breathe in
right before you die...</i>

1230
01:16:50,316 --> 01:16:53,062
Why is he talking about death
when this is just a game?

1231
01:16:54,052 --> 01:16:56,744
<i>You guys may even blame me...</i>

1232
01:16:57,326 --> 01:17:00,130
<i>You can blame me.</i>

1233
01:17:00,131 --> 01:17:02,172
<i>But don't let it be obvious.</i>

1234
01:17:03,032 --> 01:17:05,198
<i>Cause I'll come and bite you.</i>

1235
01:17:05,199 --> 01:17:06,978
Why does he keep saying he'll bite us?

1236
01:17:07,593 --> 01:17:11,550
<i>I'll... show you guys some generosity.</i>

1237
01:17:12,268 --> 01:17:16,943
<i>There is a way... you can oust me.</i>

1238
01:17:17,667 --> 01:17:20,406
- There's a way.
- He says there's a way we can oust him.

1239
01:17:21,195 --> 01:17:23,936
<i>Every time one of your friends
disappeared...</i>

1240
01:17:24,647 --> 01:17:27,030
<i>A fragment of my name tag would've
fell at the spot.</i>

1241
01:17:27,031 --> 01:17:30,616
[Pieces of the Hunter's name tag that they
need are where their friends were ousted!]

1242
01:17:30,617 --> 01:17:35,443
[Gather up all the pieces
and attach them on his back!]

1243
01:17:36,203 --> 01:17:37,918
<i>Then I'll be ousted.</i>

1244
01:17:38,736 --> 01:17:40,204
<i>Jae Suk...</i>

1245
01:17:40,891 --> 01:17:45,818
<i>I still can't forget how you attached
the name tag on my back...</i>

1246
01:17:46,475 --> 01:17:48,541
It's been two years...
that happened two years ago.

1247
01:17:48,542 --> 01:17:50,821
[That day two years ago...]

1248
01:17:52,306 --> 01:17:55,352
[After proposing they work together...]

1249
01:17:55,353 --> 01:18:00,460
[As soon as the opportunity rose
in front of him...]

1250
01:18:00,460 --> 01:18:04,254
[He betrays the Hunter that day.]

1251
01:18:07,228 --> 01:18:09,691
Let me get back on Running Man
within the next two months.

1252
01:18:09,692 --> 01:18:13,544
I will... hunt down the Grasshopper.

1253
01:18:14,612 --> 01:18:16,776
<i>What is 'touch' in English?</i>

1254
01:18:16,777 --> 01:18:18,550
<i>What is 'touch' in English?</i>

1255
01:18:18,923 --> 01:18:21,711
It's touch!
Touch in English in touch!

1256
01:18:21,712 --> 01:18:23,938
<i>You backstabbing Scoundrel...</i>

1257
01:18:25,822 --> 01:18:28,547
[Just watching him on screen is enough
to make them have a mental breakdown!]

1258
01:18:28,548 --> 01:18:30,248
<i>Come get me...</i>

1259
01:18:30,249 --> 01:18:34,525
<i>At any time... whenever...</i>

1260
01:18:34,525 --> 01:18:36,622
<i>I welcome you.</i>

1261
01:18:44,050 --> 01:18:47,407
[The Hunter!]

1262
01:18:48,218 --> 01:18:51,454
[My goodness...
Busting through the screen to appear!]

1263
01:18:52,020 --> 01:18:54,941
[Total chaos!]

1264
01:18:55,746 --> 01:18:58,566
[The two remaining survivors who are
barely holding onto their mental strings!]

1265
01:19:06,084 --> 01:19:08,527
It's scary enough to just
see you, Min Soo!

1266
01:19:08,528 --> 01:19:11,831
- Really, it's scary enough just seeing you.
- Why did you bust out of there?

1267
01:19:11,832 --> 01:19:15,316
Why did you film that
and bust out of the screen?

1268
01:19:15,317 --> 01:19:16,784
Is that the first time that's happened?

1269
01:19:18,551 --> 01:19:20,989
That's very true. Min Soo...

1270
01:19:21,629 --> 01:19:23,329
You are pretty comedic.

1271
01:19:24,046 --> 01:19:27,553
[The Hunter overflowing with
comedic sense.]

1272
01:19:27,554 --> 01:19:29,962
I still have long ways to go
if I wanted to catch up to you.

1273
01:19:32,527 --> 01:19:35,835
- Min Soo...
- You two play Rock-paper-scissors.

1274
01:19:35,836 --> 01:19:37,117
Why?

1275
01:19:37,118 --> 01:19:38,644
Rock-paper-scissors.

1276
01:19:42,078 --> 01:19:43,384
Run.

1277
01:19:44,299 --> 01:19:46,742
- But what about Gary?
- Leave him behind.

1278
01:19:51,360 --> 01:19:53,703
You're really leaving just because
I told you to leave?

1279
01:19:54,138 --> 01:19:56,172
Then what am I supposed to do?
You told me to leave.

1280
01:19:56,173 --> 01:19:57,508
You're just going to abandon him?

1281
01:19:58,008 --> 01:20:00,590
Then what am I supposed to do?
What do I do?

1282
01:20:01,112 --> 01:20:03,180
Jae Suk, just leave.
Stab me in the back and go.

1283
01:20:03,181 --> 01:20:04,948
You always live your life
stabbing others in the back!

1284
01:20:05,500 --> 01:20:07,372
- Gary!
- Jae Suk, just leave!

1285
01:20:07,373 --> 01:20:09,540
- I'll see you next week!
- Jae Suk!

1286
01:20:09,540 --> 01:20:11,389
[Coolly abandoning him.]

1287
01:20:11,390 --> 01:20:13,022
- Jae Suk!
- Yes, Min Soo?

1288
01:20:15,762 --> 01:20:19,045
Min Soo, what are you doing?
That's what we always do.

1289
01:20:19,046 --> 01:20:22,416
- This is what you are.
- Really?

1290
01:20:25,196 --> 01:20:27,201
This is what's going to happen to you.

1291
01:20:36,658 --> 01:20:37,904
Gary!

1292
01:20:37,905 --> 01:20:41,315
I'll make sure to oust Min Soo!
You just wait!

1293
01:20:42,718 --> 01:20:46,064
[All the pieces to the Hunter's name tag
are at where his friends were ousted!]

1294
01:20:47,916 --> 01:20:49,628
Just wait and see!

1295
01:20:53,376 --> 01:20:54,824
- Gary...
- Yes, Min Soo?

1296
01:20:55,108 --> 01:20:59,206
- Shall we go where the other members are?
- Yes, I think I would like that.

1297
01:20:59,932 --> 01:21:02,659
I should've tore off your name tag earlier,
I made a mistake.

1298
01:21:02,660 --> 01:21:04,500
No, Min Soo. I enjoyed myself.

1299
01:21:05,196 --> 01:21:07,512
- In that case... let's go. Get up.
- Yes, Min Soo.

1300
01:21:12,914 --> 01:21:16,673
- We weren't just getting up together?
- This must be yours.

1301
01:21:17,292 --> 01:21:18,643
I wonder why that fell off?

1302
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:24,790
Take a look... there it is.

1303
01:21:24,791 --> 01:21:27,366
[A fragment of a name tag at the spot
where Kwang Soo was ousted!]

1304
01:21:32,021 --> 01:21:33,665
The spot where Gary was ousted...

1305
01:21:36,115 --> 01:21:38,563
[Another fragment!]

1306
01:21:39,255 --> 01:21:42,579
[Four pieces currently!
Now just need two more pieces!]

1307
01:21:43,407 --> 01:21:47,432
[Heading toward the hill where
Ji Hyo's screams were heard.]

1308
01:21:50,414 --> 01:21:52,002
There it is!

1309
01:21:53,167 --> 01:21:56,125
[Obtained five pieces of the name tag!]

1310
01:21:59,893 --> 01:22:02,589
[And lastly, to the spot
where Ha Ha was ousted...]

1311
01:22:02,590 --> 01:22:08,015
[Ha Ha went towards where
all the tents were earlier...]

1312
01:22:17,392 --> 01:22:22,386
[Discovered!
A fragment to the Hunter's name tag!]

1313
01:22:31,348 --> 01:22:33,847
[That Scoundrel...]

1314
01:22:45,048 --> 01:22:48,571
[There's only one chance.
Attack the Hunter's back!]

1315
01:22:49,753 --> 01:22:51,785
I just need to stick this on his back.

1316
01:22:55,449 --> 01:23:00,653
[The battle two years in the making...
will Jae Suk be able to win?]

1317
01:23:10,961 --> 01:23:13,477
[The Hunter's appearance!]

1318
01:23:18,513 --> 01:23:21,553
 [Yoo-ruce Willis vs. The Hunter!]

1319
01:23:31,240 --> 01:23:32,385
[The challenge is...]

1320
01:23:32,385 --> 01:23:37,514
[to be met face to face!]

1321
01:23:41,423 --> 01:23:45,694
[This is their final face-off.]

1322
01:23:58,380 --> 01:24:00,711
[His completed name tag!]

1323
01:24:08,164 --> 01:24:10,192
Is this what you want?

1324
01:24:10,193 --> 01:24:12,761
Don't you even age?

1325
01:24:12,762 --> 01:24:14,659
- Pick it up.
- Excuse me?

1326
01:24:15,580 --> 01:24:16,826
Pick it up.

1327
01:24:25,620 --> 01:24:27,600
[Wait...]

1328
01:24:27,601 --> 01:24:31,163
[Hunter's tangled raincoat...]

1329
01:24:31,164 --> 01:24:33,574
[If I attach it there now...]

1330
01:24:48,816 --> 01:24:50,212
You knew?

1331
01:24:50,213 --> 01:24:52,056
You knew that your coat was
turned around?

1332
01:24:52,057 --> 01:24:55,158
Did you know that it was turned around?
Or did you not know?

1333
01:24:55,159 --> 01:24:57,565
You scared me. You didn't
know your coat was turned around?

1334
01:24:58,146 --> 01:24:59,636
You really startled me!

1335
01:24:59,637 --> 01:25:03,741
You really are a man.
You're very cool.

1336
01:25:04,443 --> 01:25:08,169
[Spectators having come out
to watch the battle.]

1337
01:25:12,262 --> 01:25:14,715
[Now...]

1338
01:25:14,716 --> 01:25:19,404
[His back is once more...]

1339
01:25:24,236 --> 01:25:29,219
[If not now...
I'll never get another chance!]

1340
01:25:42,252 --> 01:25:47,626
[If he hadn't flicked it away,
it really may have stuck on there!]

1341
01:25:48,246 --> 01:25:51,303
Were you going to throw it...
and stick it on my back?

1342
01:25:51,304 --> 01:25:52,924
- You were going to throw it on?
- No, that's not it...

1343
01:25:53,355 --> 01:25:55,590
That's... that's not it.

1344
01:25:55,591 --> 01:25:57,248
That's not it.

1345
01:25:58,642 --> 01:26:00,954
[First and second attempts both failed!]

1346
01:26:00,955 --> 01:26:04,134
[What to do now?]

1347
01:26:05,162 --> 01:26:08,416
[It won't go as you want...]

1348
01:26:08,417 --> 01:26:12,256
<i>Jae Suk and I are going to
start fighting by ourselves now.</i>

1349
01:26:13,343 --> 01:26:14,902
Satisfied?

1350
01:26:16,794 --> 01:26:18,955
I'll see you in the woods.

1351
01:26:20,825 --> 01:26:22,971
[At last... it's the beginning of the end!]

1352
01:26:24,358 --> 01:26:26,681
[Hunter vs. Yoo-ruce Willis-
The final battle...]

1353
01:26:26,682 --> 01:26:31,639
[Hunter Min Soo,
taking the final battle into the woods!]

1354
01:26:36,059 --> 01:26:39,589
[This battle has been
a long time in the making...]

1355
01:26:39,590 --> 01:26:43,333
[Shouldn't we end this now, Jae Suk?]

1356
01:26:47,517 --> 01:26:50,860
<i>Jae Suk!</i>

1357
01:26:51,905 --> 01:26:55,473
<i>Jae Suk!</i>

1358
01:26:58,103 --> 01:27:01,343
[The final call...]

1359
01:27:01,344 --> 01:27:02,751
Isn't that Min Soo's voice?

1360
01:27:04,896 --> 01:27:08,768
[Heading toward where the noise came
from to see it to the end.]

1361
01:27:08,769 --> 01:27:10,838
This is the last time for me.

1362
01:27:10,839 --> 01:27:13,601
[Heading towards the battle site
while vowing to himself.]

1363
01:27:15,693 --> 01:27:18,313
<i>Why is it so windy today?</i>

1364
01:27:18,314 --> 01:27:19,727
<i>It's creepy...</i>

1365
01:27:26,288 --> 01:27:33,613
[Running Man hunting
that started two years ago.]

1366
01:27:36,177 --> 01:27:40,045
[There's no more room to back up now...]

1367
01:27:42,425 --> 01:27:44,919
[Yoo-ruce Willis discovers something!]

1368
01:27:52,762 --> 01:27:55,252
[Hunter Min Soo's back?]

1369
01:27:56,868 --> 01:28:00,410
[Being more cautious about how he
approaches more than any other time!]

1370
01:28:00,411 --> 01:28:02,236
Stay here. Don't come.

1371
01:28:10,493 --> 01:28:15,968
[Soon... I will end it all, Min Soo.]

1372
01:28:17,243 --> 01:28:20,568
[Just as I did on that summer day
two years ago...]

1373
01:28:22,108 --> 01:28:25,397
[This time, I will make sure again...]

1374
01:28:29,315 --> 01:28:36,013
[At last...]

1375
01:28:38,414 --> 01:28:40,226
[No... something is...]

1376
01:28:44,684 --> 01:28:48,703
It's not him. I was wondering
why he was just sitting still.

1377
01:29:24,737 --> 01:29:28,431
[Shaving 10 years off of his life.
Total mental breakdown- Critical!]

1378
01:29:29,965 --> 01:29:32,479
Do you really have to oust me
like this?

1379
01:29:32,480 --> 01:29:34,225
Aren't you even curious about
who that is?

1380
01:29:34,943 --> 01:29:39,139
[No way...]

1381
01:29:39,140 --> 01:29:42,217
[Wait... now that we look at him...]

1382
01:29:43,872 --> 01:29:47,321
Why are you helping Min Soo?
You should be helping me.

1383
01:29:47,397 --> 01:29:49,883
- He was holding me captive.
- What did you say?

1384
01:29:49,884 --> 01:29:51,917
I was going to finish it in one shot

1385
01:29:51,918 --> 01:29:54,957
but when I got up close, I noticed
that he was smaller than Min Soo.

1386
01:29:58,005 --> 01:30:01,954
[And just like that,
through meticulous planning...]

1387
01:30:01,954 --> 01:30:06,387
[The final battle wins with
the Hunter's victory.]

1388
01:30:07,343 --> 01:30:08,737
- Jae Suk...
- Yes?

1389
01:30:11,277 --> 01:30:12,988
- That was great.
- Yes.

1390
01:30:12,989 --> 01:30:15,285
- Goodbye, Min Soo.
- But you're this.

1391
01:30:16,670 --> 01:30:18,244
Goodbye.

1392
01:30:18,245 --> 01:30:19,887
Come down in couple of hours, okay?

1393
01:30:26,717 --> 01:30:29,896
[We thank Park Bo Young
for making a special appearance.]

1394
01:30:37,094 --> 01:30:40,814

1395
01:30:49,729 --> 01:30:51,481
Seriously...

1396
01:30:51,482 --> 01:30:53,787
[As soon as the Hunter disappears
from his field of vision...]

1397
01:30:53,787 --> 01:30:57,215
[He starts talking crap.]

1398
01:31:00,465 --> 01:31:07,749
[Hm... I knew you'd do that.]

1399
01:31:09,591 --> 01:31:12,675
[Then... now...]
