[Will Giraffe's life just perish
in this state?]

173
00:10:31,051 --> 00:10:35,483
[The Giraffe's counterattack!]

174
00:10:36,242 --> 00:10:40,847
[Could it be that Giraffe
eliminates Shin Soo?]

175
00:10:44,495 --> 00:10:47,190
[Figures...]

176
00:10:53,878 --> 00:10:57,353
[Giraffe easily becoming eliminated.]

177
00:10:58,786 --> 00:11:02,103
[And finally properly greeting
one another.]

178
00:11:02,104 --> 00:11:03,792
You said we needed to work together!

179
00:11:05,431 --> 00:11:08,206
[Whatever...]

180
00:11:10,132 --> 00:11:13,306
[The thunderous attacks by the
Major Leaguer.]

181
00:11:16,014 --> 00:11:19,188
If I had been just a little bit faster...
the outcome would've been different.

182
00:11:20,411 --> 00:11:22,091
Choo Shin Soo...

183
00:11:22,092 --> 00:11:27,329
[You've arrived at jail now.
Hurry up and get out...]

184
00:11:49,449 --> 00:11:51,791
[An all-out escape!]

185
00:11:53,801 --> 00:11:58,115
[Tiger Shin Soo on his tail
like a streak of thunder!]

186
00:12:05,286 --> 00:12:08,114
[And Hyun Jin's about to join the fray?]

187
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:12,757
[It looks as though they're ready to
chase him down to the ground.]

188
00:12:20,232 --> 00:12:22,641
[Ultimately, losing even
all their camera VJ's...]

189
00:12:26,176 --> 00:12:28,484
[Hyun Jin following up from behind.]

190
00:12:33,682 --> 00:12:36,489
[Jae Suk already having been captured...]

191
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:38,796
Hyun Jin... you want to rip it off,
or you want me to do it?

192
00:12:42,726 --> 00:12:45,576
[The two athletes with no mercy.]

193
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:49,475
[The world of professionals where greetings
come after determining the winners first...]

194
00:12:49,476 --> 00:12:51,522
Where were you?

195
00:12:52,197 --> 00:12:54,851
[Blaming it on his VJ, Gwon Yeol.]

196
00:12:57,347 --> 00:13:00,789
Wait... how could you have just
ripped it off like that?

197
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:03,659
How could you have just ripped it off
without any warnings like that?

198
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:05,387
We should've talked it out first...

199
00:13:05,388 --> 00:13:07,821
- Ryu Hyun Jin, where are you going?
- I'm running from him now.

200
00:13:07,822 --> 00:13:10,923
[Hyun Jin escaping from Shin Soo.]

201
00:13:10,924 --> 00:13:12,637
It's nice to meet you.

202
00:13:15,012 --> 00:13:18,642
He just... rips off the tag
as soon as he sees one.

203
00:13:20,262 --> 00:13:22,060
Shouldn't you be going to jail now?

204
00:13:22,061 --> 00:13:23,729
Yes, I have to go to jail now.

205
00:13:24,216 --> 00:13:31,583
[The pride in our own hitter...
Eliminated three people within 10 minutes.]

206
00:13:40,908 --> 00:13:42,451
[Terror]

207
00:13:42,452 --> 00:13:44,638
Wait! It's nice to meet you.

208
00:13:45,581 --> 00:13:47,994
[And right away!]

209
00:13:52,881 --> 00:13:56,263
[The National Treasure pitcher
showing no mercy.]

210
00:13:56,264 --> 00:13:58,015
Why...

211
00:13:58,016 --> 00:14:00,462
Why are we doing this so early
in the morning?

212
00:14:02,931 --> 00:14:05,165
Hyun Jin...
it's so great to meet you.

213
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:09,530
<i>[Red card for Gary. Red card for Gary.]</i>

214
00:14:09,531 --> 00:14:11,858
It was an honor.

215
00:14:17,842 --> 00:14:20,769
At least I got one now. Good.

216
00:14:20,769 --> 00:14:24,535
[I got one too...]

217
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:29,458
[Exhaustion?]

218
00:14:38,642 --> 00:14:40,320
This is killing me...

219
00:14:42,437 --> 00:14:44,872
[As for exhaustion,
it's the same for Choo Shin Soo.]

220
00:14:44,873 --> 00:14:46,989
I haven't worked out once
since the season ended...

221
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:53,156
Aren't you giving us any water?

222
00:14:57,149 --> 00:14:59,468
Hyun Jin, come here. Seriously.

223
00:14:59,468 --> 00:15:01,399
Who do we have left?

224
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,478
[Until they're the only ones left, they're
competing against each other for now.]

225
00:15:04,478 --> 00:15:08,414
- Let's join forces.
- Okay... until the end, okay?

226
00:15:08,415 --> 00:15:11,755
[After doing some running,
realize they need allies?]

227
00:15:11,756 --> 00:15:14,416
- This is harder than working out.
- Look at how sweaty I am.

228
00:15:16,002 --> 00:15:17,532
- How many have you eliminated?
- Three.

229
00:15:17,533 --> 00:15:19,853
You did? Did you
eliminate them all right away?

230
00:15:22,587 --> 00:15:27,185
Since... there's only
a two-way crossroad here...

231
00:15:27,186 --> 00:15:29,061
I got you...

232
00:15:37,018 --> 00:15:41,062
[Uh! Ji Hyo and Sae Yeon...]

233
00:15:41,063 --> 00:15:43,371
- Did you see?
- Flower girl!

234
00:15:43,659 --> 00:15:45,469
- He called me flower girl...
- Did you see?

235
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:47,423
- I saw it all.
- Did you see them getting eliminated?

236
00:15:47,424 --> 00:15:49,865
- I saw it from a distance.
- Jong Kook, I saw it from right here.

237
00:15:49,866 --> 00:15:51,697
And he ripped off the whole name tag
including the backing!

238
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:54,173
You two girls shouldn't be going
around alone.

239
00:15:54,174 --> 00:15:55,645
We had no other choice.
Come over this way.

240
00:15:56,265 --> 00:15:58,707
[Heading to Mr. Capable who is weak
when it comes to female guests.]

241
00:15:58,707 --> 00:16:02,096
- You're not trying to rip mine off, right?
- No, I promise that I won't do that.

242
00:16:02,097 --> 00:16:04,593
Jong Kook, we're all afraid right now.

243
00:16:07,304 --> 00:16:10,392
His screams sound like Min Soo's...

244
00:16:12,489 --> 00:16:14,984
How are Ryu Hyun Jin and Shin Soo
related? Are they a team?

245
00:16:14,984 --> 00:16:17,899
This is an individual battle.

246
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:20,604
But Sae Yeon said she wants to
rip off Suk Jin's name tag.

247
00:16:21,486 --> 00:16:24,480
[Sae Yeon's wish is to oust Suk Jin.]

248
00:16:24,481 --> 00:16:26,285
I have no idea where Suk Jin
is though.

249
00:16:26,286 --> 00:16:27,881
[Just where in the world is Suk Jin?]

250
00:16:27,882 --> 00:16:30,588
[Ah...]

251
00:16:31,597 --> 00:16:33,539
This really is pathetic.

252
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:35,250
[It's an especially cruel jungle for
Impala to be playing in today.]

253
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:37,246
There are a lot of carnivores
out there today.

254
00:16:39,695 --> 00:16:41,287
I can't even drink this.

255
00:16:41,288 --> 00:16:43,836
[It's hard to get his fluid intake
in his hideout position...]

256
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:47,335
[Readily joining in on the picture taking.]

257
00:16:48,871 --> 00:16:50,475
I can't keep staying here forever...

258
00:16:52,454 --> 00:16:53,565
I should get out of here.

259
00:16:53,566 --> 00:16:55,678
[Could he be heading into the jungle?]

260
00:16:55,678 --> 00:16:57,857
As soon as I'm seen,
I'm going to be ousted.

261
00:17:11,961 --> 00:17:13,632
[Ah! They saw each other!]

262
00:17:13,632 --> 00:17:16,071
I got you...

263
00:17:17,916 --> 00:17:20,545
[I'm caught...]

264
00:17:23,057 --> 00:17:25,823
[Tiger Shin Soo giving chase.]

265
00:17:28,804 --> 00:17:30,065
<i>Shin Soo!</i>

266
00:17:30,066 --> 00:17:32,464
[That's why you should've
just stayed in hiding...]

267
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:38,292
[As planned, Monster Pitcher, Ryu Hyun Jin
has him corralled on the other end!]

268
00:17:39,423 --> 00:17:41,698
[Right - Hyun Jin]

269
00:17:41,699 --> 00:17:44,064
[Left - Shin Soo]

270
00:17:45,429 --> 00:17:48,480
[This truly is a siege.]

271
00:17:49,716 --> 00:17:51,520
Wait... wait!

272
00:17:52,749 --> 00:17:54,288
Are the two of you on the
same team?

273
00:17:57,614 --> 00:17:59,292
It's been an honor.

274
00:17:59,293 --> 00:18:02,220
[Out within one minute of
leaving his seclusion.]

275
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:06,851
I'm telling you, it splits just like that.
It was a good plan.

276

<i>[Red card for Ji Suk Jin.

[Darn!]

278
00:18:18,203 --> 00:18:23,518
You should go down the emergency stairs,
and come up and flush them out this way.

279
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:25,316
<i>Are the two of you on the
same team?</i>

280
00:18:25,317 --> 00:18:26,404
Yes.

281
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:29,314
I told him that I'd lose to him at the end.

282
00:18:32,476 --> 00:18:34,393
Since he's come from so far
to be here...

283
00:18:42,117 --> 00:18:45,098
[Mr. Capable seriously on the move.]

284
00:18:50,945 --> 00:18:54,179
[Hyun Jin is on the other side...]

285
00:18:58,677 --> 00:19:00,727
- Hello.
- Hello.

286
00:19:00,728 --> 00:19:03,606
Hello. Wait... wait...

287
00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:08,679
[Running away?]

288
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,609
- Seriously, don't come any closer.
- Hyun Jin...

289
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:12,162
- Hyun Jin...
- No.

290
00:19:12,163 --> 00:19:15,407
[Monster Hyun Jin avoiding Mr. Capable.]

291
00:19:15,408 --> 00:19:17,222
- Excuse me?
- You close with Choo Shin Soo?

292
00:19:17,223 --> 00:19:19,439
- You're asking if I know him?
- You know him well, right?

293
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,762
- Yes.
- Are you two close?

294
00:19:20,763 --> 00:19:26,164
Well... wouldn't it nice if you were to win?
Because there would be advantages to that.

295
00:19:26,164 --> 00:19:31,241
So why don't the two of us work together
and oust Choo Shin Soo first...

296

[The target is to beat
Tiger Shin Soo first?]

pretend that you haven't met me yet.</i>

302
00:19:57,369 --> 00:20:01,973

he is faced with him.]

310

right away to give chase.]

footsteps, heads in the opposite direction!]

[Even taking off your watch?
Just what are you planning on doing?]

Why don't we get everything else settled
and save this until the end?

facing each other to the end.]

Hyun Jin...

340
00:22:22,919 --> 00:22:27,258
[The ones left watching
are in a state of nervousness.]

341
00:22:27,259 --> 00:22:30,603
Why are you so sweaty? I can't
even get a grip because you're sweaty.

342
00:22:32,748 --> 00:22:35,787
[What to do...]

343
00:22:37,154 --> 00:22:41,540
[Because he's a man who's lived all
his life for the win...]

344
00:22:45,585 --> 00:22:48,017
[So fast!
Mr. Capable capturing his arm!]

345
00:22:50,809 --> 00:22:53,553
[Monster Hyun Jin's arrival?]

346
00:22:55,224 --> 00:22:59,415
[Tiger Shin Soo vs.
Mr. Cable's fierce battle!]

347
00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:03,026
[A man's battle without any leniency!]

348
00:23:04,446 --> 00:23:06,250
[Mr. Capable having pushed him
into the wall!]

349
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:09,212
[And Shin Soo's name tag!]

350
00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:17,109
[How could this be? Mr. Capable!]

351
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:18,516
<i>You should've listened when
I was being nice!</i>

352
00:23:19,738 --> 00:23:22,566
I told you that we could've waited
until the end!

353
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:24,160
[Darn... I lost!]

354
00:23:24,161 --> 00:23:25,466
See? What did I tell you?

355
00:23:25,467 --> 00:23:27,242
[Total elation]

356
00:23:27,243 --> 00:23:28,725
<i>Ji Hyo!</i>

357
00:23:28,726 --> 00:23:30,564
I did it!

358
00:23:30,565 --> 00:23:33,257
We are Running Man!

359
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:37,904
This is what you call skills!

360
00:23:37,905 --> 00:23:39,465
Everyone...

361
00:23:40,034 --> 00:23:42,771
[The result of the battle that he wants
to announce to the whole world.]

362
00:23:43,751 --> 00:23:45,783
That's why I should've done it quicker.

363
00:23:45,784 --> 00:23:47,645
[Upset...]

364
00:23:51,449 --> 00:23:53,776
[That guy is something else...]

365
00:24:02,867 --> 00:24:05,255
I don't think this is right...

366
00:24:08,564 --> 00:24:10,806
[Choo Shin Soo - Out!]

367
00:24:17,927 --> 00:24:19,569
<i>Hyun Jin!</i>

368
00:24:20,075 --> 00:24:22,373
[The two finally meeting again.]

369
00:24:22,373 --> 00:24:24,160
Did you eliminate him?

370
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:30,158
- Hyun Jin...
- You're not going to betray me, right?

371
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:32,085
- You're not going to betray me?
- Where have you been?

372
00:24:32,086 --> 00:24:35,281
I told you to stay by my side
when we faced off with Shin Soon.

373
00:24:35,282 --> 00:24:38,148
- You should've yelled for me.
- What did you say?

374
00:24:38,149 --> 00:24:39,452
Yell?

375
00:24:39,453 --> 00:24:42,438
I yelled so much, everyone
stepped out to see what was going on.

376
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:44,123
<i>Hyun Jin...</i>

377
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:49,422
Why don't we oust the ladies first,
and you and I can wait to the end...

378
00:24:49,423 --> 00:24:51,162
What do you think?

379
00:24:54,943 --> 00:24:55,990
<i>What did you say?</i>

380
00:24:55,990 --> 00:24:57,842
- What are you whispering about?
- What did you say?

381
00:24:57,843 --> 00:25:00,138
[How absurd!]

382
00:25:00,139 --> 00:25:02,386
- You're going to betray us like that?
- What are you talking about?

383
00:25:02,387 --> 00:25:04,502
Hyun Jin... we didn't talk about
that, right?

384
00:25:05,735 --> 00:25:08,370
Jong Kook...
I just saw you negotiating with him.

385
00:25:08,371 --> 00:25:11,117
- It wasn't like that.
- Whatever. I just saw everything.

386
00:25:11,118 --> 00:25:12,995
[Huh?]

387
00:25:12,996 --> 00:25:14,960
What are you doing?

388
00:25:14,961 --> 00:25:17,025
You know what I'm saying, right?

389
00:25:17,026 --> 00:25:19,042
[Hand signaling back and forth
with Ji Hyo?]

390
00:25:19,972 --> 00:25:21,192
Ji Hyo...

391
00:25:21,193 --> 00:25:23,877
Think... think about this carefully.

392
00:25:23,878 --> 00:25:25,771
- Think about this carefully.
- Ji Hyo, I am thinking carefully.

393
00:25:25,772 --> 00:25:29,105
[Both of them are trying to recruit
Hyun Jin to their side.]

394
00:25:29,106 --> 00:25:31,584
Ji Hyo is not an easy opponent.

395
00:25:31,585 --> 00:25:34,226
Think about it carefully.
And I have Sae Yeon here too.

396
00:25:34,227 --> 00:25:36,636
- She really is not very easy...
- I gave her a break earlier.

397
00:25:36,637 --> 00:25:37,876
Really?

398
00:25:38,785 --> 00:25:41,546
If you've let her go once,
isn't it time to oust her now?

399
00:25:41,547 --> 00:25:43,156
[Since he let her go once,
it's time to oust her now?]

400
00:25:43,157 --> 00:25:45,155
[Nodding his head yes?]

401
00:25:46,792 --> 00:25:48,822
[Not to us delicate girls!]

402
00:25:48,823 --> 00:25:50,448
It's not that...

403
00:25:50,449 --> 00:25:52,546
- What should we do? What do you think?
- What are you going to do?

404
00:25:53,705 --> 00:25:56,141
- In that case...
- Where are you going?

405
00:25:56,142 --> 00:25:57,422
Where are you going?

406
00:25:57,423 --> 00:25:59,283
[What? Heading towards
Mr. Capable's back?]

407
00:25:59,284 --> 00:26:00,858
What are you doing?

408
00:26:01,964 --> 00:26:03,718
The moment I turn my back...

409
00:26:05,429 --> 00:26:07,713
It's like a sickness...

410
00:26:13,806 --> 00:26:17,774
[Sae Yeon also eyeing Ji Hyo's back...]

411
00:26:19,685 --> 00:26:22,016
Wow... did you just see her?

412
00:26:22,017 --> 00:26:23,515
You just saw her, right?

413
00:26:23,516 --> 00:26:26,841
[Symptoms of Running Man-itis:
Desire to rip-off any name tag that they see.]

414
00:26:26,842 --> 00:26:29,063
I think she's got the sickness too.

415
00:26:31,356 --> 00:26:33,063
How's this going to work?

416
00:26:33,992 --> 00:26:36,627
[Everyone to scatter for now from
not being able to trust one another.]

417
00:26:36,628 --> 00:26:38,668
You go too! I want you to go too!

418
00:26:40,636 --> 00:26:42,504
[My hand just automatically...]

419
00:26:43,765 --> 00:26:45,958
<i>Those two were really enjoying it.</i>

420
00:26:45,959 --> 00:26:49,291
<i>He was seriously enjoying it.
The expression on your face...</i>

421
00:26:49,712 --> 00:26:51,989
You know I've been
eliminated countless times...

422
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:54,445
but he really was the worst out of
anyone that I've been eliminated by before.

423
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:56,716
Shin Soo made me feel most nervous.

424
00:26:56,717 --> 00:26:58,546
I wonder what'll happen between
him and Kim Jong Kook?

425
00:27:00,735 --> 00:27:02,239
You're out?

426
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,665
By Jong Kook?

427
00:27:03,666 --> 00:27:06,793
[Shin Soo enters the jail room after
being ousted by Mr. Capable.]

428
00:27:06,794 --> 00:27:08,910
- What happened with Jong Kook
- It's nice to meet you.

429
00:27:08,911 --> 00:27:10,137
By Jong Kook?

430
00:27:10,198 --> 00:27:12,706
I'm sorry. I didn't even get to
greet any of you properly first...

431
00:27:12,707 --> 00:27:14,031
Was it one on one?

432
00:27:17,648 --> 00:27:20,784
- I really wanted to win...
- He says he really wanted to win...

433
00:27:20,784 --> 00:27:24,432
[The battle with Mr. Capable
that he really wanted to win.]

434
00:27:24,433 --> 00:27:26,215
When I found out that
I was coming on the show

435
00:27:26,215 --> 00:27:31,175
all my friends and people around me
asked me to make sure to get Kim Jong Kook.

436
00:27:31,175 --> 00:27:33,607
- But what to do now?
- That he pretends to be so fierce...

437
00:27:33,608 --> 00:27:36,045
They all said they think he acts like
he's so tough and fierce.

438
00:27:36,046 --> 00:27:38,563
But when your friends see it,
I bet they'll be really surprised.

439
00:27:38,564 --> 00:27:40,195
They'll realize that he's not
pretending after all.

440
00:27:40,196 --> 00:27:42,316
They'll just acknowledge that
he is fierce.

441
00:27:42,317 --> 00:27:43,944
<i>Wow... he's fierce!</i>

442
00:27:55,272 --> 00:27:57,956
[No other choice but to go hide,
and then attack his back!]

443
00:28:16,274 --> 00:28:18,773
[Blank Ji collapsing to the floor.]

444
00:28:20,409 --> 00:28:22,236
Are you going to be like this?

445
00:28:27,131 --> 00:28:28,959
What? What was that?

446
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:35,589
You are out.

447
00:28:40,903 --> 00:28:44,191
[Easily... Ji Hyo is out!]

448
00:28:45,388 --> 00:28:47,010
Seriously...

449
00:28:47,579 --> 00:28:49,506
I think I'm going to faint.

450
00:28:51,685 --> 00:28:54,802
<i>That was way too intense!</i>

451
00:28:56,292 --> 00:28:57,886
[Huh? Where is he headed?]

452
00:28:57,887 --> 00:29:00,511
[Sae Yeon is in the elevator!]

453
00:29:05,466 --> 00:29:07,281
No... no!

454
00:29:09,670 --> 00:29:11,124
- Do you know who I am?
- Yes.

455
00:29:11,125 --> 00:29:12,539
You know...

456
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:16,195
I'm sorry, I was wrong...

457
00:29:18,458 --> 00:29:21,011
Coolly ousting her.

458
00:29:21,012 --> 00:29:23,029
I didn't get to rip off any
name tags...

459
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:29,152
<i>[Red card for Jin Sae Yeon.
Red card for Jin Sae Yeon.]</i>

460
00:29:29,153 --> 00:29:33,363
<i>Red card for Jin Sae Yeon.
Red card for Jin Sae Yeon.</i>

461
00:29:33,364 --> 00:29:36,158
How could he... he's really cruel.

462
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:37,279
[The power of Monster Hyun Jin.]

463
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:38,802
He's slyly cruel.

464
00:29:42,904 --> 00:29:45,320
Jong Kook and Ryun Hyun Jin
are the only ones left now.

465
00:29:45,321 --> 00:29:46,605
It's a battle between
the Monster and the Tiger.

466
00:29:47,335 --> 00:29:51,793
[The cheer is without a doubt for...
Ryu Hyun Jin?]

467
00:29:51,794 --> 00:29:54,942
<i>Ryu Hyun Jin!
Ryu Hyun Jin!</i>

468
00:29:54,943 --> 00:29:58,637
<i>Ryu Hyun Jin!
Ryu Hyun Jin!</i>

469
00:30:00,527 --> 00:30:05,023
[The two facing their final battle.]

470
00:30:05,434 --> 00:30:07,142
- You've won a lot, haven't you?
- Excuse me?

471
00:30:07,143 --> 00:30:08,685
You've won a lot.

472
00:30:08,686 --> 00:30:11,428
On Running Man?
Yes, I've won a lot.

473
00:30:11,429 --> 00:30:13,010
I have done a lot... yes, I have.

474
00:30:13,011 --> 00:30:14,698
Then why don't you give
this one to me?

475
00:30:17,245 --> 00:30:19,351
You have to get to the major
leagues now?

476
00:30:19,352 --> 00:30:21,295
- Yes.
- Shouldn't you go easy on your body?

477
00:30:21,296 --> 00:30:24,287
- No. This is nothing.
- What are you talking about?

478
00:30:24,288 --> 00:30:26,363
- You shouldn't be doing this.
- This much is no big deal.

479
00:30:27,309 --> 00:30:30,959
[Two men without any leniency
when faced with a chance at a victory.]

480
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,067
Have you learned any skills when
it comes to ripping off the name tags?

481
00:30:32,068 --> 00:30:35,337
No. It was difficult even when I had to
rip them off the ladies' backs.

482
00:30:35,338 --> 00:30:36,645
Really? I don't believe you.

483
00:30:36,646 --> 00:30:38,582
I heard the announcements
right after one another.

484
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:45,616
Shall we run at each other from over
there and go at it in one shot?

485
00:30:45,617 --> 00:30:46,721
Should we?

486
00:30:46,722 --> 00:30:51,100
[Standing apart from left to right
and facing each other in a single blow?]

487
00:30:51,688 --> 00:30:53,324
<i>I think I can picture it.</i>

488
00:30:53,325 --> 00:30:54,765
<i>Yeah, I'm getting the picture.</i>

489
00:30:54,766 --> 00:30:57,557
Okay... then why don't we do this?

490
00:30:57,558 --> 00:31:00,564
Then... come running.

491
00:31:00,565 --> 00:31:04,036
[Run at each other and no defense?]

492
00:31:04,037 --> 00:31:05,203
- Okay?
- Deal.

493
00:31:05,203 --> 00:31:07,988
[Only attack!]

494
00:31:08,612 --> 00:31:10,699
[A handshake to seal the deal.]

495
00:31:13,422 --> 00:31:16,177
[The Monster's attack!]

496

and going for the attack!]

tightly in his grasp!]

00:31:45,359 --> 00:31:49,229
[I won!]

00:31:53,511 --> 00:31:56,832
[A celebration over
Monster Hyun Jin's victory!]

502
00:32:00,414 --> 00:32:03,821
Do you know how angry Shin Soon is
from having been defeated by you?

503
00:32:03,822 --> 00:32:06,491
- He is really mad.
- Why do you have that?

504
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,788
This is...

505
00:32:15,979 --> 00:32:19,742
[His anger seems to resurface as soon as
he saw his ripped off name tag...]

506

Choo Shin Soo is really angry right now...

507

I heard that you really beat
up Shin Soo?

508
00:32:24,906 --> 00:32:26,925
No, that's not true!

509
00:32:26,926 --> 00:32:29,217
Do you know how much he's worth?

510
00:32:29,218 --> 00:32:31,954
- When did I...
- Look at his arm!

511
00:32:32,696 --> 00:32:34,147
I can't lift up my arm...

512
00:32:35,150 --> 00:32:37,522
What do you mean, you can't lift it up
when it was your name tag that was ripped off?

513
00:32:39,345 --> 00:32:42,047
<i>I will explain today's race to you.</i>

514
00:32:42,048 --> 00:32:43,319
<i>Today's race is...</i>

515
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:48,455
<i>Two rounds of psychic sports,
including psychic baseball.</i>

516
00:32:48,455 --> 00:32:50,213
- That sounds like fun!
- Psychic baseball!

517
00:32:50,214 --> 00:32:52,676
[It's baseball!]

518
00:32:53,685 --> 00:32:59,361
<i>Through psychic games that are about to start,
you have to earn psychic power vouchers.</i>

519
00:32:59,362 --> 00:33:04,538
<i>And once you get to your final location,
you can trade that in for a psychic power.</i>

520
00:33:05,497 --> 00:33:08,066
<i>[- What is that?
- I don't know...]</i>

521
00:33:08,067 --> 00:33:10,089
We're all clapping without knowing either.

522
00:33:12,533 --> 00:33:13,876
[Just big smiles for now.]

523
00:33:13,876 --> 00:33:16,181
Sae Yeon's really full of big,
bright smiles.

524
00:33:16,182 --> 00:33:17,885
Aren't her smiles so bright?

525
00:33:17,886 --> 00:33:21,174
<i>Since this is a baseball game,
you will be divided into two teams.</i>

526
00:33:21,175 --> 00:33:25,659
<i>There's an advantage for Ryu Hyun Jin
who won this first game.</i>

527
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:28,026
[The victor of the name tag elimination
Hyun Jin is given an advantage.]

528
00:33:31,357 --> 00:33:33,727
[And that is...]

529
00:33:33,728 --> 00:33:36,311
[Psychic power card?]

530
00:33:36,311 --> 00:33:38,053
Then what does it mean?

531
00:33:38,054 --> 00:33:42,679
[Team Ryu will start off with
two psychic power cards.]

532
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:44,459
<i>You said we can trade them in later?</i>

533
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:46,602
<i>He already has skills
when it comes to baseball...</i>

534
00:33:46,603 --> 00:33:50,357
<i>You'll find out what psychic powers they're
for once you get to your final location.</i>

535
00:33:50,358 --> 00:33:54,724
<i>But since you don't know what you'll get,
the more vouchers you get, the better.</i>

536
00:33:54,725 --> 00:33:56,226
I understand.

537
00:33:58,006 --> 00:33:59,516
[Team Ryu: Jong Kook, Gary, Kwang Soo,
Sae Yeon]

538
00:33:59,516 --> 00:34:01,097
[Team Choo: Jae Suk, Suk Jin, Ha Ha, Ji Hyo]

539
00:34:01,494 --> 00:34:03,780
[Team Ryu getting ready for takeoff.]

540
00:34:06,957 --> 00:34:09,837
[His seat seems to be too small for him.]

541
00:34:09,838 --> 00:34:11,949
<i>Please excuse us.</i>

542
00:34:11,950 --> 00:34:14,267
Okay. This is the race to win
psychic powers.

543
00:34:14,268 --> 00:34:17,168
<i>[Go on to Baebongsan Amusement Park!]</i>

544
00:34:18,335 --> 00:34:19,948
Let's go!

545
00:34:19,949 --> 00:34:21,652
Let's go!

546
00:34:23,057 --> 00:34:24,461
<i> Let's go.</i>

547
00:34:26,618 --> 00:34:30,271
Hyun Jin, when we play games today,
you have to do a good job, okay?

548
00:34:30,272 --> 00:34:31,586
Me?

549
00:34:31,587 --> 00:34:33,099
[Already ordering Hyun Jin around.]

550
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:34,560
He's an athlete, I'm sure he'll do well.

551
00:34:34,561 --> 00:34:37,585
- Why are you telling him that?
- When it comes to games...

552
00:34:37,586 --> 00:34:41,055
[He's the man that would give shooting
pointers even to Michael Jordan.]

553
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:50,827
Shin Soo and I decided to speak
in casual speech with one another earlier.

554
00:34:50,828 --> 00:34:54,066
- Seriously?
- How old are you, Ms. Ji Hyo?

555
00:34:54,067 --> 00:34:56,969
- Yes... I'm older than you.
- Seriously?

556
00:34:56,970 --> 00:34:58,876
She's older than she looks.

557
00:34:58,877 --> 00:35:00,705
I'm sorry to tell you this,
but you're the youngest here.

558
00:35:01,696 --> 00:35:03,150
- I am?
- Yes.

559
00:35:03,151 --> 00:35:05,985
- You're the youngest.
- But it was really funny earlier.

560
00:35:05,986 --> 00:35:09,193
What Shin Soo mentioned earlier.
Go Choo (Hot pepper).

561
00:35:09,194 --> 00:35:11,753
[The cheer they shout out for
Shin Soo in America.]

562
00:35:11,754 --> 00:35:16,338
People in America shout out 'Go Choo'
for that he can feed off their energy...

563
00:35:16,339 --> 00:35:17,562
It's what they shout out for him.

564
00:35:17,563 --> 00:35:20,653
<i>Go Choo! Go Choo!</i>

565
00:35:20,654 --> 00:35:24,290
- But since they shout out Go Choo...
- I bet Korean people laugh at that.

566
00:35:24,291 --> 00:35:26,865
- Yes, all the Koreans laugh at it.
- He says that they do.

567
00:35:26,866 --> 00:35:29,236
Go Choo! Go Choo!

568
00:35:30,707 --> 00:35:34,770
Do it a little faster.
Go Choo! Go Choo!

569
00:35:41,068 --> 00:35:42,924
[Team Ryu's car]

570
00:35:42,925 --> 00:35:45,341
Ryu Hyun Jin looks like it's a tight
squeeze for him up in the front seat.

571
00:35:45,342 --> 00:35:48,491
[The image of Hyun Jin's tightly
squeezed in body in his seat.]

572
00:35:48,492 --> 00:35:51,007

573
00:35:57,710 --> 00:35:59,793
Choo! Choo!

574
00:35:59,794 --> 00:36:04,883
<i>Go Choo! Go Choo!</i>

575
00:36:07,433 --> 00:36:09,940
Hyun Jin... isn't your
seat a little too tight for you?

576
00:36:09,941 --> 00:36:11,852
I feel so uncomfortable right now.

577
00:36:16,578 --> 00:36:18,447
He's really cute.

578
00:36:18,448 --> 00:36:21,180
<i>He's so cute,
I just want to pinch him.</i>

579
00:36:22,115 --> 00:36:25,215
[Imposingly large cutie pie]

580
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:28,610
<i>We've arrived!</i>

581
00:36:29,971 --> 00:36:33,783
[Arriving at the amusement park where
beautiful autumn leaves are abundant.]

582
00:36:37,895 --> 00:36:39,145
What is that?

583
00:36:39,145 --> 00:36:41,891
[A scene has been set up...
and two chairs?]

584
00:36:41,892 --> 00:36:43,097

00:36:49,252 --> 00:36:52,948
[First up is Jae Suk for Team Choo.]

588
00:36:52,949 --> 00:36:55,866
- Would Jong Kook like to be first?
- How about you go first?

589
00:36:57,070 --> 00:37:00,697
- But this is...
- You can do this.

590
00:37:00,698 --> 00:37:02,715
- Really?
- Jae Suk's legs are pretty strong.

591
00:37:02,716 --> 00:37:05,373
Look at this...
Look at Hyun Jin's thighs!

592
00:37:05,374 --> 00:37:07,853
I can't even get both of my hands
wrapped around the width of them!

593
00:37:07,854 --> 00:37:10,902
I think it's about three times
the size of yours.

594
00:37:10,903 --> 00:37:13,373
[Jae Suk's legs looking
very tiny in comparison.]

595

[Starting off with his legs
in an open stance...]

00:37:25,317 --> 00:37:26,728
Rip his legs open, okay?

599
00:37:26,729 --> 00:37:29,833
Hyun Jin, if you can't open them up
all the way, then it doesn't count.

600
00:37:31,445 --> 00:37:33,828
Why do you keep backing up?
[A tight mental battle to start the game.]

601
00:37:35,294 --> 00:37:37,127
What are you doing?

602
00:37:40,581 --> 00:37:42,786
But that's too much!

603
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:47,087

have won.]

01:16:24,655 --> 01:16:30,563
[And the ball Hyun Jin hit is...
a fly out!]

1176
01:16:33,669 --> 01:16:35,775
[And Jong Kook who's gotten
the feel for the game...]

1177
01:16:39,271 --> 01:16:44,035
[Anyways, Team Ryu gets
two of their players onto the bases!]

1178
01:16:44,764 --> 01:16:46,902
I've been waiting for you.

1179
01:16:47,624 --> 01:16:49,453
Lee Kwang Soo...

1180
01:16:49,454 --> 01:16:51,310
That's something that I should
be saying.

1181
01:16:51,311 --> 01:16:54,058
I'm going to make sure to
strike you out.

1182
01:16:54,490 --> 01:16:56,634
This time, I'm going to hit a homerun.

1183
01:16:56,635 --> 01:17:00,044
The one who strikes out Lee Kwang Soo!

1184
01:17:00,045 --> 01:17:02,635
The one who humiliates
the crap out of Yoo Jae Suk!

1185
01:17:11,768 --> 01:17:13,975
[The ball is airborne up high in the air!]

1186
01:17:16,194 --> 01:17:17,794
He's out, he's out!

1187
01:17:19,031 --> 01:17:21,970
[If the runner gets outside the line,
then that player is out!]

1188
01:17:22,722 --> 01:17:24,652
He's out. He's out of the line.

1189
01:17:25,353 --> 01:17:30,409
[When even a single meter outside the line
means out, he was about three feet out...]

1190
01:17:30,410 --> 01:17:32,294
I don't know baseball all that well.

1191
01:17:32,904 --> 01:17:35,558
Why am I out?
Can you explain it to me?

1192
01:17:36,321 --> 01:17:38,101
<i>Player switch out.</i>

1193
01:17:38,102 --> 01:17:40,444
I seriously don't know...

1194
01:17:43,542 --> 01:17:45,430
[Running Man Series-
Bottom of the second inning.]

1195
01:17:47,596 --> 01:17:48,809
Fighting!

1196
01:17:48,810 --> 01:17:50,106
<i>Play ball!</i>

1197
01:17:50,107 --> 01:17:51,441
Time!

1198
01:17:51,442 --> 01:17:53,446
The one who controls the glove!

1199
01:17:53,446 --> 01:17:55,749
- What...
- No, it's the bat. The bat.

1200
01:17:55,750 --> 01:17:57,593
- Bat, it's the bat.
- Oh...

1201
01:17:58,838 --> 01:18:00,713
Here, take my glove!

1202
01:18:02,183 --> 01:18:04,352
- Try doing something with my glove!
- Ji Hyo, it's the bat.

1203
01:18:06,203 --> 01:18:07,619
He wants her to try...

1204
01:18:08,051 --> 01:18:09,382
Time!

1205
01:18:09,383 --> 01:18:11,818
The one who controls the bat!

1206
01:18:14,396 --> 01:18:17,393
[The bat Ji Hyo previous used by calling in
on her powers makes its appearance again.]

1207
01:18:23,329 --> 01:18:25,948
It's going to Jong Kook! Jong Kook!

1208
01:18:26,355 --> 01:18:28,469
It's going to Jong Kook!

1209
01:18:30,108 --> 01:18:32,390
[Mr. Capable blunders his move!]

1210
01:18:33,709 --> 01:18:34,814
What are you doing?

1211
01:18:36,341 --> 01:18:37,757
<i>She's safe!</i>

1212
01:18:41,154 --> 01:18:46,141
- This is just too sweet! Kim Jong Kook...
- You can't play baseball!

1213
01:18:46,142 --> 01:18:48,448
Let's always play baseball
whenever Jong Kook is around.

1214
01:18:48,449 --> 01:18:50,249
<i>It's the first time I've seen him
like that.</i>

1215
01:18:50,927 --> 01:18:52,764
He's playing like a newbie...
a newbie!

1216
01:18:58,840 --> 01:19:00,148
Time!

1217
01:19:01,101 --> 01:19:03,717
One who controls Ryu Hyun Jin!

1218
01:19:04,475 --> 01:19:06,654
<i>One who controls Ryu Hyun Jin!</i>

1219
01:19:10,093 --> 01:19:11,741
The one from earlier.

1220
01:19:11,742 --> 01:19:15,720
[Choosing the bounce ball that
he used earlier again.]

1221
01:19:16,744 --> 01:19:19,344
[But Blank Ji Hyo seems to have
strayed pretty far from the base.]

1222
01:19:19,345 --> 01:19:21,723
[Will she be okay?]

1223
01:19:23,390 --> 01:19:25,100
<i>Ha Ha, hit the ball.</i>

1224
01:19:25,101 --> 01:19:28,029
[Checking up on first base.]

1225
01:19:35,157 --> 01:19:40,276
[Amazing...
Song Ji Hyo even knows how to slide...]

1226
01:19:40,926 --> 01:19:42,732
Hey! Ryu Hyun Jin!

1227
01:19:45,604 --> 01:19:47,489
What kind of a woman slides to
the base?

1228
01:19:47,490 --> 01:19:51,197
[Our Ace Ji Hyo,
who doesn't mess around.]

1229
01:20:01,644 --> 01:20:03,698
[Sliding]

1230
01:20:04,988 --> 01:20:07,674
[Team Choo slides to safety
at first and second base.]

1231
01:20:07,675 --> 01:20:10,853
Jae Suk... the one who controls
the bases!

1232
01:20:11,892 --> 01:20:15,620
The one controls the bases!

1233
01:20:16,263 --> 01:20:17,651
What's that?

1234
01:20:18,868 --> 01:20:22,323
<i>The one who controls the bases!</i>

1235
01:20:32,180 --> 01:20:34,334
- Where are you going?
- The home plate is going to third!

1236
01:20:35,081 --> 01:20:43,047
[Once the spell is shouted out, the home plate
moves to third and once crossed, you're home.]

1237
01:20:44,745 --> 01:20:49,555
[An easier way to score
a point than a homerun.]

1238
01:20:49,556 --> 01:20:50,673
[And on top of that,
first and second bases are loaded.]

1239
01:20:50,674 --> 01:20:55,437
[The golden opportunity to
score points!]

1240
01:20:55,438 --> 01:20:57,838
<i>Ji Hyo, just run! Run unconditionally!</i>

1241
01:20:58,407 --> 01:21:03,372
[And... the moment has arrived...]

1242
01:21:03,373 --> 01:21:05,533
[Batter, Choo Shin Soo]

1243
01:21:05,533 --> 01:21:08,607
[Pitcher, Ryu Hyun Jin]

1244
01:21:10,028 --> 01:21:12,913
[Choo Shin Soo]

1245
01:21:12,913 --> 01:21:17,538
[Anointed as representative of Korea
for major league baseball.]

1246
01:21:20,946 --> 01:21:24,101
[Ryu Hyun Jin]

1247
01:21:24,102 --> 01:21:30,448
[An athlete who's now
about to face a much bigger stage.]

1248
01:21:36,213 --> 01:21:41,598
[Batter, Choo Shin Soo
vs. Pitcher, Ryu Hyun Jin]

1249
01:21:41,599 --> 01:21:45,833
[A face-off by two players representing
the face of Korea in baseball!]

1250
01:21:47,187 --> 01:21:51,080
The fact that these two players are
meeting out on the baseball field like this...

1251
01:21:51,081 --> 01:21:53,764
is a great treat for all of us
and to the viewers watching this at home.

1252
01:21:53,765 --> 01:21:58,178
[The first battle between these two
major leaguer's that we'll soon get to see.]

1253
01:21:59,392 --> 01:22:03,635
[Just what will be the outcome?]

1254
01:22:15,454 --> 01:22:18,777
[No desire to joke around.]

1255
01:22:18,778 --> 01:22:21,915
- Choo! Choo!
- Ryu Hyun Jin!

1256
01:22:23,323 --> 01:22:27,087
<i>Go Choo! Go Choo!</i>

1257
01:22:29,444 --> 01:22:32,519
[Seems to be putting too much
force behind his shoulder.]

1258
01:22:34,052 --> 01:22:37,556
<i>Ryun Hyun Jin seems to be
a little nervous at the moment...</i>

1259
01:22:37,557 --> 01:22:39,359
- It's a ball!
- No, that wasn't.

1260
01:22:39,360 --> 01:22:41,235
- It's definitely not a ball.
- It's not?

1261
01:22:42,275 --> 01:22:44,591
[Let's see then...]

1262
01:22:44,592 --> 01:22:47,271
[A slight curve?]

1263
01:22:47,272 --> 01:22:50,160
[In that case...]

1264
01:22:53,430 --> 01:22:56,008
[Shin Soo bunts the ball!]

1265
01:22:56,008 --> 01:22:59,625
[An easy ground ball
headed towards Jong Kook!]

1266
01:23:02,470 --> 01:23:07,559
[Home plate is at the third base!
They need to tag Ji Hyo quickly!]

1267
01:23:13,558 --> 01:23:17,866
[Ji Hyo uses that moment to run as fast as
she could and successfully makes it home!]

1268
01:23:18,782 --> 01:23:20,060
One point!

1269
01:23:20,061 --> 01:23:21,955
She made it to the plate.

1270
01:23:26,456 --> 01:23:28,234
[Running Man Series-
Top of the third inning]

1271
01:23:29,051 --> 01:23:31,869
[Team Ryu currently behind 5:2.
This is their final attack.]

1272
01:23:42,299 --> 01:23:44,062
The one who steals second base!

1273
01:23:44,063 --> 01:23:45,610
<i>The one who steals second base!</i>

1274
01:23:47,279 --> 01:23:51,815
[Once the spell is shouted out, second base
disappears allowing direct access to third.]

1275
01:23:55,626 --> 01:23:57,205
What the heck? What happened to
second base?

1276
01:23:57,206 --> 01:23:58,973
<i>What the heck?
What happened to second base?</i>

1277
01:23:59,563 --> 01:24:00,872
Where did second base go?

1278
01:24:01,651 --> 01:24:06,419
[Giraffe not having seen the explanation
sheet for Second Base Stealer.]

1279
01:24:06,420 --> 01:24:07,929
- Where did second base go?
- Where did it go?

1280
01:24:09,459 --> 01:24:11,402
<i>What the heck?</i>

1281
01:24:12,451 --> 01:24:13,913
We got it, we got it.

1282
01:24:14,860 --> 01:24:17,847
- Where did second base go?
- I'm the one who steals the second base.

1283
01:24:17,848 --> 01:24:19,501
You should've told me about
it sooner!

1284

<i>Sae Yeon!</i>

1288

The one who controls homeruns!

1289
01:24:33,659 --> 01:24:36,983
- The one who controls homeruns!
- No way! That's absurd!

1290
01:24:39,618 --> 01:24:42,133
[Team Ryu already seeming to
sense their victory.]

1291
01:24:42,134 --> 01:24:43,485

1292
01:24:43,999 --> 01:24:45,416
<i>Use your power.</i>

1293
01:24:47,923 --> 01:24:49,287
Homerun!

1294
01:24:53,922 --> 01:24:56,245
[A masterful homerun!]

1295
01:24:56,245 --> 01:24:57,829
[A smoke blast]

1296
01:24:59,533 --> 01:25:04,515
[Team Ryu bringing home two players
with Jin Sae Yeon's homerun hit.]

1297
01:25:04,516 --> 01:25:06,332
<i>That was absurd...</i>

1298
01:25:06,333 --> 01:25:11,047
[A reversal!
Team Ryu- 6 : Team Choo- 5]

1299

[Running Man Series-
Bottom of the third inning.]

1301

[Team Choo's last chance at an attack!]

1302
01:25:25,041 --> 01:25:28,749
[Shin Soo stewing in anger over
how the game got flipped around.]

1303
01:25:28,750 --> 01:25:30,273
You could use your spell.

1304
01:25:32,729 --> 01:25:36,103
Let's score some points and win.
Shin Soo's worked so hard for the win.

1305
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:41,048
Ryu Hyun Jin, get out here.
Ryu Hyun Jin.

Ryu Hyun Jin,
are you avoiding the battle?

1308
01:25:47,011 --> 01:25:49,468
You... stick boy, get out of the way.

1309
01:25:49,854 --> 01:25:52,439

Ryu Hyun Jin!

<i>You telephone pole,
get out of the way.</i>

1311
01:25:55,217 --> 01:25:57,419
- Kwang Soo...
- This is their last offense.

1312
01:25:58,015 --> 01:25:59,712
Ha Ha! Hit one out of there!

1313
01:25:59,713 --> 01:26:02,543
Not you, but send Ryu Hyun Jin
out here.

1314

<i>Hitting him in the face with one...</i>

at the batter at top speeds.]

1322
01:26:31,242 --> 01:26:33,305
- Seriously...
- Why don't you try talking again?

1323
01:26:33,306 --> 01:26:36,127
I guess you must be afraid of me,
having to use your Roll-Roll's like that.

1324

You coward...

1325

1332
01:26:56,040 --> 01:26:59,833
Just picture me beating you
if you lose this game for us.

1333
01:27:00,446 --> 01:27:01,929

- Why?

01:27:39,641 --> 01:27:42,322
- Both of you are out!
- Why?

1341
01:27:42,323 --> 01:27:43,656
Out!

1342
01:27:43,657 --> 01:27:46,378
- No, no, no!
- We've already made up!

1343
01:27:46,379 --> 01:27:48,824
- We've made up! We're okay now!
- We're fine!

1344
01:27:48,825 --> 01:27:51,217
- We're actually really close!
- We fought because we're so close!

1345
01:27:52,051 --> 01:27:54,286
[Adamant Umpire Kim Hwan]

1346
01:27:54,287 --> 01:27:55,655
<i>You're out.</i>

1347
01:27:56,476 --> 01:27:59,146
- We were fighting because we're friends.
- What were you guys thinking?

1348
01:27:59,147 --> 01:28:02,967
- We were doing it to be funny!
- You didn't think it was funny?

1349
01:28:06,052 --> 01:28:07,487
<i>Play ball!</i>

1350
01:28:08,227 --> 01:28:11,197
- Okay, this is for real.
- You're playing for real?

1351
01:28:11,197 --> 01:28:14,489
Hyun Jin, we have to finish this up.
Show us what you're made of.

1352
01:28:17,291 --> 01:28:18,709
Strike!

1353
01:28:18,710 --> 01:28:20,307
Strike!

1354
01:28:20,416 --> 01:28:22,079
Strike, you're out!

1355
01:28:22,080 --> 01:28:26,122
[A strike out- Two outs total]

1356
01:28:26,122 --> 01:28:30,338
[If one more batter is stuck out,
then it's Team Ryu's win!]

1357
01:28:30,339 --> 01:28:32,111
<i>Ryu Hyun Jin is throwing it for real.</i>

1358
01:28:44,331 --> 01:28:45,829
Strike one.

1359
01:28:51,275 --> 01:28:52,932
<i>Strike two!</i>

1360
01:28:55,060 --> 01:28:57,028
[Two strikes on top of two outs!]

1361
01:28:57,029 --> 01:29:00,710
[Is this the end of the game?]

1362
01:29:00,711 --> 01:29:02,801
<i>Yoo Jae Suk, fighting!</i>

1363
01:29:05,346 --> 01:29:06,902
[Just barely hitting the ball!]

1364
01:29:06,903 --> 01:29:10,439
[Why did it have to roll in front
of Hyun Jin of all people?]

1365
01:29:11,484 --> 01:29:15,559
[If he throws the ball to the first base,
then the game is over!]

1366
01:29:19,592 --> 01:29:21,744
[Misses!]

1367
01:29:22,792 --> 01:29:26,904
[The tennis ball is much more difficult for
players to control than regular baseballs.]

1368
01:29:26,905 --> 01:29:28,945
<i>Run! Run quickly!</i>

1369
01:29:28,946 --> 01:29:31,050
<i>Get to the home plate!</i>

1370
01:29:32,546 --> 01:29:36,644
[A glimmer of hope! With two
outs, moves on to second base!]

1371
01:29:36,644 --> 01:29:37,923
<i>Time!</i>

1372
01:29:37,924 --> 01:29:39,252
<i>The one who controls the base!</i>

1373
01:29:40,463 --> 01:29:42,743
<i>The one who controls the base!</i>

1374
01:29:43,495 --> 01:29:47,154
[The home plate is moving to the third base!]

1375
01:29:47,870 --> 01:29:51,757
[Have to use every psychic power
that is available to them...]

1376
01:29:51,758 --> 01:29:54,395
- Use that other power too!
- The one who controls the bat!

1377
01:29:55,066 --> 01:29:58,328
[Team Choo- Simultaneously using
all the psychic powers that they can use.]

1378
01:29:58,329 --> 01:30:00,247
- How did this happen?
- We can't let them score the point!

1379
01:30:00,248 --> 01:30:02,431
<i>- What are we going to do?
- Bring it home!</i>

1380
01:30:03,233 --> 01:30:06,508
The incredible strength!

1381
01:30:07,985 --> 01:30:15,501
[If he can cross the home plate with a teammate
on his back, then it equals two points.]

1382
01:30:17,252 --> 01:30:19,489
[Team Ryu tightening up their defense!]

1383
01:30:19,490 --> 01:30:22,588
<i>[Defense Roll-Roll!]</i>

1384
01:30:23,664 --> 01:30:30,692
[Several Roll-Roll Alter-egos are
brought onto the field for added defense!]

1385
01:30:30,693 --> 01:30:32,855
<i>How many of them are there?</i>

1386
01:30:33,544 --> 01:30:36,167
<i>This is the final round!
Two outs with two at base.</i>

1387
01:30:37,301 --> 01:30:39,333
<i>Ji Hyo, you have to hit it!</i>

1388
01:30:43,671 --> 01:30:46,159
Don't you think he's out too far?

1389
01:30:46,160 --> 01:30:50,302
[Straying that far out with someone
on his back on top of it?]

1390
01:30:51,300 --> 01:30:53,591
<i>If you don't like it,
then check and oust him.</i>

1391
01:30:54,490 --> 01:30:57,304
[It does seem possible to oust him
by doing a quick check...]

1392
01:30:57,304 --> 01:31:01,988
[Nerve-wracking...
If they make it, then it's two added points!]

1393
01:31:02,522 --> 01:31:04,023
Yes, I understand.

1394
01:31:04,579 --> 01:31:05,960
I'll do as you tell me to do.

1395
01:31:08,047 --> 01:31:09,218
Strike!

1396
01:31:11,147 --> 01:31:14,806
[Swinging a strike from a ball
having flown by too fast.]

1397
01:31:16,128 --> 01:31:19,283
- I almost just checked on him...
- Ji Hyo, just hold the bat in front of you.

1398
01:31:20,376 --> 01:31:22,153
<i>You can just hold it out in front of you.</i>

1399
01:31:22,154 --> 01:31:27,102
[A reversal of the game with one point,
and next up to bat is Choo Shin Soo.]

1400
01:31:27,102 --> 01:31:31,206
[There's no way to go!]

1401
01:31:36,995 --> 01:31:39,459
[It hit Ji Hyo's bat!]

1402
01:31:43,862 --> 01:31:46,229
[And the ball if rolling towards Hyun Jin!]

1403
01:31:46,230 --> 01:31:49,926
[Flying like lightening to bring
the ball to first base himself!]

1404
01:31:54,223 --> 01:31:55,962
<i>Ji Hyo, you should've ran!</i>

1405
01:31:57,407 --> 01:32:01,597
[With Team Ryu's Hyun Jin running the ball
to first base himself, he ends the game!]

1406
01:32:01,598 --> 01:32:04,028
[Blank...]

1407
01:32:04,233 --> 01:32:05,701
<i>Wait!</i>

1408
01:32:05,702 --> 01:32:07,796
Future Ddak-ji!

1409
01:32:08,332 --> 01:32:10,036
The one who sees into the future!

1410
01:32:10,620 --> 01:32:13,409
- What?
- I just saw the future!

1411
01:32:13,825 --> 01:32:16,405
- You have to run as soon as you hit, okay?
- I got it!

1412
01:32:16,406 --> 01:32:19,189
I didn't... I didn't know
that I should've been running!

1413
01:32:19,190 --> 01:32:21,750
Here... the one who sees into the future!

1414
01:32:21,751 --> 01:32:23,081
Me too!

1415
01:32:23,082 --> 01:32:25,044
- Hurry up and throw it down too.
- I can't do it.

1416
01:32:30,450 --> 01:32:34,549
And so, Team Ryu Hyun Jin wins
today's Psychic Baseball game.

1417
01:32:34,550 --> 01:32:38,498
[2012 Psychic Baseball- Team Ryu's win!]

1418
01:32:38,499 --> 01:32:40,950
- I'm sorry.
- We almost had it...

1419
01:32:42,195 --> 01:32:49,153
[The prize is...
a trophy with a pure gold badge.]

1420
01:32:49,154 --> 01:32:50,887
2012 Running Man baseball victory.

1421
01:32:50,888 --> 01:32:52,620
Look at Shin Soo...

1422
01:32:53,652 --> 01:32:56,394
- Shin Soo really is angry.
- He looks very mad.

1423
01:32:56,395 --> 01:32:58,367
We should've been the one to take that!

1424
01:32:59,311 --> 01:33:01,212
I came on the show to win that trophy...

1425
01:33:03,097 --> 01:33:04,607
That's really cool.

1426
01:33:04,608 --> 01:33:07,886
Anyways... Team Ryu Hyun Jin wins!

1427
01:33:07,887 --> 01:33:09,012
[The pride of Republic of Korea,
