00:00:43,498 --> 00:00:45,207
Why did you call me out so
early in the morning?

10
00:00:46,119 --> 00:00:47,939
Is this for a mission?

11
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:53,137
I'm not going to be the spy...
I'm not doing it.

12

There's someone else in here
besides me, right?

39
00:02:22,693 --> 00:02:23,800

We have to get it done quickly.

54
00:03:19,884 --> 00:03:23,890
By any chance...
is that a house phone too?

- No, there isn't.

Excuse me.

71
00:04:33,655 --> 00:04:35,442
By any chance, is there a house phone?

[Oh no! It's Jae Suk!]

73
00:04:42,693 --> 00:04:46,027
[Could that be...]

74
00:04:46,028 --> 00:04:47,373
Lee Kwang Soo!

75
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:52,040
[Escape!]

76
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:58,910

then his mission is a success!]

stairway!]

What are you doing?

83
00:05:15,646 --> 00:05:17,466
Kwang Soo, listen to me.

84
00:05:19,016 --> 00:05:21,140
- Kwang Soo...
- Don't come near me. What's that?

85
00:05:21,141 --> 00:05:22,641
- Come here.
- No!

86
00:05:22,642 --> 00:05:24,852
[The sticker is issued!]

87
00:05:24,853 --> 00:05:26,011
No!

88
00:05:26,011 --> 00:05:28,736

sticker that's been stuck on him.]

<i>Kwang Soo!</i>

93

<i>I now declare you my underling.</i>

94
00:05:44,402 --> 00:05:46,116
Jae Suk, aren't you going to give me
a jacket like yours?

95
00:05:46,117 --> 00:05:47,272
What?

96
00:05:47,273 --> 00:05:50,453
[The Giraffe is jealous of the look
that Jae Suk has going for himself.]

97
00:05:50,454 --> 00:05:52,963
<i>Jae Suk, you've gained one point.</i>

98
00:05:52,964 --> 00:05:55,569
<i>If Lee Kwang Soo had succeeded,
he would've gained two points.</i>

99
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:58,416
- Kwang Soo, that's not what's important.
- I almost completed my mission!

100
00:05:58,417 --> 00:06:00,631
How is a point or two important
between us?

101
00:06:00,632 --> 00:06:02,768
- Kwang Soo...
- I have zero points.

102
00:06:02,769 --> 00:06:04,790
It's okay. How is that
different than any other time?

103
00:06:08,908 --> 00:06:11,133
<i>You've got seven minutes
to complete your mission.</i>

104
00:06:14,544 --> 00:06:18,890
[Which agent has infiltrated this place?]

105
00:06:20,363 --> 00:06:24,121
[Could it be...]

106
00:06:24,121 --> 00:06:30,781
[The female student who seems
to be in search of something...]

107
00:06:37,248 --> 00:06:38,707
Hello.

108
00:06:40,767 --> 00:06:44,015
[That's right, she is...]

109
00:06:44,015 --> 00:06:47,881
[A woman we're all very familiar with...]

110
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:53,185
[Jae Suk and the Giraffe who have started
their mission at the same time as her...]

111
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:01,677
- Nothing, Jae Suk.
- Have you searched in there?

112
00:07:03,011 --> 00:07:05,332
Jae Suk... this is my area.

113
00:07:06,103 --> 00:07:08,411
Don't you trust me?

114
00:07:12,945 --> 00:07:14,719
[Maybe I'm wrong?]

115
00:07:23,734 --> 00:07:30,027
[Huh? Another secret agent?]

116
00:07:30,028 --> 00:07:33,240
[Oh no! She saw Jong Kook?]

117
00:07:34,061 --> 00:07:36,764
By any chance, have you seen...

118
00:07:37,937 --> 00:07:40,308
[Misunderstanding Jong Kook to be there
also to capture her and making her escape!]

119
00:07:45,997 --> 00:07:47,223
There's someone there.

120
00:07:47,224 --> 00:07:50,933
[Running away as fast as she can
after sensing the danger.]

121
00:07:50,934 --> 00:07:54,833
The woman that just passed by here
looked like someone very famous...

122
00:07:54,834 --> 00:07:57,331
[Whew... I should be safe now, right?]

123
00:08:03,433 --> 00:08:04,769
Song Ji Hyo!

124
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:09,864
[Seeing a suspicious woman...]

125
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:12,389
[And chasing after her
like a bolt of lightning!]

126
00:08:12,389 --> 00:08:14,969
<i>Run, Ji Hyo! Run!</i>

127
00:08:14,969 --> 00:08:16,601
<i>Run!</i>

128
00:08:16,602 --> 00:08:18,612
I stuck it on her... I got her.

129
00:08:18,613 --> 00:08:22,104
- I got her... wait, who is this?
- Hello.

130
00:08:22,105 --> 00:08:23,941
What? You're not Song Ji Hyo!

131
00:08:24,673 --> 00:08:28,102
[Wait... this is...]

132
00:08:28,103 --> 00:08:32,615
[Special Female Agent, Park Shin Hye]

133
00:08:32,616 --> 00:08:35,345
Jae Suk, why did you twist her
arm like that?

134
00:08:35,346 --> 00:08:38,781
You're really making big mistakes
so early in the morning!

135
00:08:38,782 --> 00:08:40,932
Wait... Park Shin Hye...

136
00:08:40,933 --> 00:08:43,446
- Where did you stick it on?
- I stuck this one on her.

137
00:08:43,447 --> 00:08:45,425
It must've fallen off.

138
00:08:45,426 --> 00:08:47,577
- So you didn't get me?
- No, I stuck one on!

139
00:08:47,578 --> 00:08:50,014
[Escaping right away?]

140
00:08:53,378 --> 00:08:55,696
[Jae Suk gains another point!]

141
00:08:56,598 --> 00:09:00,914
[While Special Agent Shin Hye's
being recruited, who's the next agent?]

142
00:09:06,161 --> 00:09:08,940
[The secret agent in this location...]

143
00:09:10,554 --> 00:09:14,566
[Coming down the stairs while hiding
his face with the newspaper...]

144
00:09:19,398 --> 00:09:21,228
It's so great to see you!

145
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:24,080
It's been about six years since
I've seen you last?

146
00:09:24,081 --> 00:09:32,682
[The Secret Agent here is none other than...
The Crowned Prince, Lee Seung Gi!]

147
00:09:32,682 --> 00:09:36,846
I thought I'd never see you again...
but here I am, seeing you again!

148
00:09:36,846 --> 00:09:39,700
I've been keeping up with this show,
and really enjoying it!

149
00:09:39,701 --> 00:09:41,572
<i>You're a secret agent today.</i>

150
00:09:41,573 --> 00:09:45,502
[All the Running Man are in the process of
recruiting agents at the moment.]

151
00:09:45,503 --> 00:09:49,972
- They're going to come to get you at the end.
- They're coming to get me?

152
00:09:49,973 --> 00:09:51,782
They're not coming to greet me?

153
00:09:51,783 --> 00:09:54,253
- No, they're coming to capture you.
- They're coming to capture me right away?

154
00:09:54,253 --> 00:09:55,334
<i>Yes, right off the bat.</i>

155
00:09:55,334 --> 00:09:57,483
I wanted to catch up with Jae Suk since
it's been forever since I've seen him.

156
00:09:57,483 --> 00:09:59,671
But we're not doing any of that,
but jumping right into it?

157
00:09:59,672 --> 00:10:01,544
<i>You can catch up with him
after the mission is over.</i>

158
00:10:01,545 --> 00:10:03,897
Mission first, greetings later.
Yes, I understand.

159
00:10:04,803 --> 00:10:07,035
- Here's your first mission.
- Ah, so this is it.

160
00:10:07,036 --> 00:10:08,668
You are a secret agent.

161
00:10:08,669 --> 00:10:12,402
Transport the secret 007 case to a locker.

162
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:15,659
If you find the secret code there to
open the case and blow the whistle

163
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:17,360
you'll gain two points.

164
00:10:17,361 --> 00:10:20,919
<i>You've got about five minutes left
to complete the mission.</i>

165
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,111
What? I only get five minutes?

166
00:10:22,112 --> 00:10:25,616
What is this then... there are only
eight minutes for the whole mission?

167
00:10:25,617 --> 00:10:29,221
Wow... this is...
Wait, in that case...

168
00:10:29,662 --> 00:10:35,976
I'm sorry, but actually since we've worked
together in the past on other programs

169
00:10:35,977 --> 00:10:40,820
can I put my manners aside and ask
you if I can borrow your jacket?

170
00:10:40,821 --> 00:10:42,951
[Asking the VJ to
exchange his jacket with him.]

171
00:10:42,952 --> 00:10:45,645
This is a jacket I'm sponsoring,
so you have to be careful with it, okay?

172
00:10:50,593 --> 00:10:52,472
Would you like for me to
carry your bag for you?

173
00:10:52,473 --> 00:10:55,209
[To perfect his disguise,
requesting for the bag too?]

174
00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:57,608
The bag...

175
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,681
This is heavy.
Maybe I should just take it off.

176
00:11:02,682 --> 00:11:04,090
This is way too heavy.

177
00:11:04,091 --> 00:11:06,112
You have to carry this around
while you film?

178
00:11:06,113 --> 00:11:08,950
I don't think you worked this hard
in the past, did you?

179
00:11:09,213 --> 00:11:11,640
[I can't believe him...]

180
00:11:11,641 --> 00:11:15,501
I really don't think you worked this hard
when we worked together on the other show?

181
00:11:15,502 --> 00:11:16,905
[A comfortable affection passing through
in their conversation?]

182
00:11:16,906 --> 00:11:18,914
Where are you?

183
00:11:20,363 --> 00:11:22,974
[Many members of Running Man who's been
recruited during some time.]

184
00:11:22,974 --> 00:11:25,362
[Mission start!]

185
00:11:25,363 --> 00:11:27,262
<i>Seven minutes for the mission?</i>

186
00:11:30,609 --> 00:11:32,965
[The Giraffe just whizzing by!]

187
00:11:32,966 --> 00:11:35,707
Giraffe! Stop!

188
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:37,378
- Hey Giraffe, stop!
- There's no stopping in this game!

189
00:11:39,912 --> 00:11:41,556
Run! It's this way!

190
00:11:44,243 --> 00:11:45,589
What are you doing?

191
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:49,108
[Miss Blank having discovered
Gary's car.]

192
00:12:01,234 --> 00:12:04,219
[Discovers someone!]

193
00:12:12,871 --> 00:12:15,138
- Gary!
- You've got the wrong person!

194
00:12:15,912 --> 00:12:18,322
[Shin Hye issuing out a sticker]

195
00:12:18,322 --> 00:12:19,638
Hello!

196
00:12:20,349 --> 00:12:24,439
[Catches Gary in 45 seconds!]

197
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,568
<i>Is it already over?</i>

198
00:12:25,568 --> 00:12:27,245
How did you know it was me?
I even have glasses on!

199
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:31,420
[Even at a quick glance,
it's obviously awkward Gary...]

200
00:12:31,421 --> 00:12:33,181
Even from a quick glance,
I could tell it was Gary.

201
00:12:33,182 --> 00:12:35,917
[While all the Running Man
are being recruited...]

202
00:12:35,917 --> 00:12:40,420
[Another agent who's still
trying to perfect his disguise.]

203
00:12:40,421 --> 00:12:43,478
[Infiltrating the stationary store.]

204
00:12:44,112 --> 00:12:45,350
Hello.

205
00:12:45,351 --> 00:12:48,137
[With his characteristic affinity,
greeting the person brightly first.]

206
00:12:48,138 --> 00:12:50,372
Yes... hello, it's nice to meet you.

207
00:12:50,373 --> 00:12:54,944
Something to help... oh, here it is.

208
00:12:58,203 --> 00:13:01,107
This one... I'll just take this one.

209
00:13:01,108 --> 00:13:03,215
Can I try on the helmet?

210
00:13:04,044 --> 00:13:07,737
Look, it's been taped up over here.

211
00:13:07,738 --> 00:13:10,781
[Agent Seung Gi, trying to
disguise himself as the delivery man.]

212
00:13:10,781 --> 00:13:12,396
They probably won't recognize me,
right?

213
00:13:12,397 --> 00:13:14,346
You can't tell either, right?

214
00:13:20,225 --> 00:13:21,359
You can't tell, right?

215
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,892
You really can't, can you?

216
00:13:24,171 --> 00:13:28,603
[A perfectionist?
Trying to find delivery invoices...]

217
00:13:28,604 --> 00:13:30,771
And the box over there.

218
00:13:30,772 --> 00:13:32,847
- It has carbon copy.
- Really?

219
00:13:32,848 --> 00:13:35,752
[Wow... an invoice too?]

220
00:13:36,568 --> 00:13:40,490
I'm using this as a hint for
the members.

221
00:13:41,963 --> 00:13:45,332
[An even kind hint for the members.]

222
00:13:46,935 --> 00:13:50,450
[No one has succeeded
in this mission thus far.]

223
00:13:51,666 --> 00:13:54,154
I don't know what I would've done if
I hadn't borrowed this helmet.

224
00:13:57,672 --> 00:14:00,858
All the other members
have failed this mission?

225
00:14:04,192 --> 00:14:06,702
This is suddenly starting to
make me nervous.

226
00:14:09,792 --> 00:14:12,770
Of all songs, it's
'Catch me' by DBSK playing?

227
00:14:14,106 --> 00:14:15,688
What if I get caught?

228
00:14:15,689 --> 00:14:18,204
Who turned that song on?
Did you do it?

229
00:14:18,205 --> 00:14:19,480
It wasn't?

230
00:14:19,481 --> 00:14:21,628
This is a bad sign...

231
00:14:23,154 --> 00:14:25,642
<i>All the members have just arrived.</i>

232
00:14:25,643 --> 00:14:27,994
- They're here?
- You're going to start now simultaneously.

233
00:14:27,995 --> 00:14:32,150
[Agent Seung Gi's mission - Start!]

234
00:14:33,281 --> 00:14:34,736
Hello?

235
00:14:34,737 --> 00:14:37,597
[Surprising ability to camouflage himself.]

236
00:14:39,563 --> 00:14:40,909
Perfect... this is perfect.

237
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:44,348
[Seeming very pleased with
his disguise.]

238
00:14:44,349 --> 00:14:47,016
If I seriously get caught like this,
I'll just give up.

239
00:14:47,017 --> 00:14:50,690
[Catch me?]

240
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,213
[Gangnam Station Street, Seoul]

241
00:14:56,127 --> 00:14:59,262
[Agent Seung Gi entering his mission.]

242
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:05,196
[While no one seem to recognize
who he is in the streets of Gangnam...]

243
00:15:05,196 --> 00:15:08,941
[Infiltrating through exit number five]

244
00:15:08,942 --> 00:15:09,996
<i>There's only one person left now.</i>

245
00:15:09,997 --> 00:15:12,729
[At the same time]

246
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:15,335
I understand.

247
00:15:15,336 --> 00:15:16,902
Let's go!

248
00:15:18,519 --> 00:15:22,097
[Curious about who the other
agent could be.]

249
00:15:22,098 --> 00:15:25,222
[The members and Agent Shin Hye are
entering through exit number three.]

250
00:15:29,193 --> 00:15:31,748
[I wonder where the lockers are...]

251
00:15:37,457 --> 00:15:39,688
<i>I'm nervous... I'm so nervous.</i>

252
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:43,887
[Even though there are so many people
inside the train station like this...]

253
00:15:43,888 --> 00:15:46,587
[No one seems to recognize him...]

254
00:15:46,588 --> 00:15:48,414
Shall we get started, Kwang Soo?

255
00:15:48,415 --> 00:15:50,574
[Agents having made
their way down to the station.]

256
00:15:50,575 --> 00:15:51,742
I'm ready.

257
00:15:54,057 --> 00:15:56,449
Look far and wide...
Everyone, keep your eyes out.

258
00:15:57,248 --> 00:16:00,535
[Running right away in the morning.]

259
00:16:00,536 --> 00:16:03,233
I'm so out of breath...
why are we running already?

260
00:16:19,778 --> 00:16:21,464
I think it's around here somewhere?

261
00:16:23,915 --> 00:16:27,786
[Looking for more props for his disguise?]

262
00:16:31,386 --> 00:16:33,023
There's no mark...

263
00:16:35,092 --> 00:16:37,823
I don't think it's that far out.
I think it's in the other direction.

264
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:49,650
[Agent Gary passing by without
noticing anything!]

265
00:16:49,651 --> 00:16:50,809
I need to get the point...

266
00:16:51,509 --> 00:16:54,893
[Agent Seung Gi's feeling just
as anxious...]

267
00:16:54,894 --> 00:16:57,087
I think I'll find something
if I just keep following you.

268
00:17:06,405 --> 00:17:10,578
[Huh? The Giraffe suspects
something?]

269
00:17:11,517 --> 00:17:14,161
[Is Agent Seung Gi in danger?]

270
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:19,435
I got you!

271
00:17:19,436 --> 00:17:21,050
[Issues out a sticker!]

272
00:17:21,051 --> 00:17:22,516
I got you!

273
00:17:22,517 --> 00:17:23,869
Who is it?

274
00:17:24,666 --> 00:17:26,552
He's good looking! Who is it?

275
00:17:28,046 --> 00:17:30,125
I got you...
I already got you with the sticker.

276
00:17:32,773 --> 00:17:35,617
[Agent Seung Gi is caught!]

277
00:17:35,618 --> 00:17:37,923
<i>How did you know?</i>

278
00:17:38,267 --> 00:17:40,706
[Agent Seung Gi fails his mission
after all he did to prepare for it...]

279
00:17:40,706 --> 00:17:44,220
<i>It's so great to see you...
it's been like six years...</i>

280
00:17:44,221 --> 00:17:46,829
[Clothes and the bag from the VJ
he hasn't seen in a long time...]

281
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:51,643
[And he even got to borrow a helmet
from the owner of the stationary shop...]

282
00:17:51,644 --> 00:17:58,485
[He was really feeling ambitious after
hearing how everyone else had failed...]

283
00:17:58,486 --> 00:18:00,710
[But he's been caught...]

284
00:18:00,711 --> 00:18:02,796
How did you know with all this?

285
00:18:05,106 --> 00:18:07,565
I really prepared a lot for this!

286
00:18:07,566 --> 00:18:11,506
- But you really stuck out.
- I never dreamt that it'd be Seung Gi.

287
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:13,829
- Have you been well?
- Yeah, have you been well?

288
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:16,207
It's really great to see you!

289
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:18,780
- It's really been awhile.
- It's been too long!

290
00:18:19,894 --> 00:18:24,726
[And thus, all nine of the agents
are finally gathered together.]

291
00:18:26,462 --> 00:18:31,821
[Seeing him again for the first time since he
was a High School Student on X-Man.]

292
00:18:32,841 --> 00:18:38,330
[His 'Usher' dance that he used to
dance for the audience?]

293
00:18:38,331 --> 00:18:41,531
[His moves used to be a bit stiff.]

294
00:18:41,532 --> 00:18:44,981
- He's not much of a dancer.
- Can I take my helmet off?

295
00:18:49,726 --> 00:18:51,882
[Resuming the filming,
time to do the slate...]

296
00:18:51,883 --> 00:18:52,413
<i>Would you like to hit the slate,
Seung Gi?</i>

297
00:18:52,414 --> 00:18:56,178
- Seung Gi, why don't you do it?
- Kwang Soo, you stay out of it.

298
00:18:56,179 --> 00:18:58,625
- Don't do it.
- But he's younger than me.

299
00:19:00,673 --> 00:19:02,875
Running Man, it's great to be on here.

300
00:19:05,873 --> 00:19:09,464
Our guests today
are Seung Gi and Shin Hye!

301
00:19:09,465 --> 00:19:10,507
[Lee Seung Gi, Park Shin Hye - Welcome!]

302
00:19:12,567 --> 00:19:17,791
[Shin Hye appeared in Jong Kook's
music video when she was in high school.]

303
00:19:17,792 --> 00:19:20,201
I have no idea how long it's been since
I've seen Seung Gi after X-Man!

304
00:19:20,202 --> 00:19:22,644
I've really been enjoying following
your show.

305
00:19:22,645 --> 00:19:24,448
Really? You watch our show?

306
00:19:24,449 --> 00:19:28,431
- He really keeps up with...
- I understood Hong Gil Dong's feelings.

307
00:19:29,175 --> 00:19:32,155
Even though the show's really funny,
I couldn't exactly come out and say it...

308
00:19:32,156 --> 00:19:34,867
I always felt like...

309
00:19:35,637 --> 00:19:38,613
My friend texts me every week
to tell me how funny the show was.

310
00:19:40,595 --> 00:19:44,309
What is this all about anyways
so early in the morning?

311
00:19:44,825 --> 00:19:47,219
- How many points do you have?
- I have four points.

312
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:48,460
I have zero points.

313
00:19:49,602 --> 00:19:54,622
[Remember the points you've each
earned during your morning mission.]

314
00:19:54,623 --> 00:19:56,076
<i>You'll find out how those points
are going to work for you.</i>

315
00:19:56,077 --> 00:19:58,532
- Really? What is it?
- I think it's a mission.

316
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:03,344
- That looks like the Korean flag...
- It's a tiger with the flag.

317
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:06,666
- Who is that?
- Who's that back there?

318
00:20:06,666 --> 00:20:12,350
[The person inside the screen is...]

319
00:20:12,351 --> 00:20:15,729
[The one in charge of MI-6, 'M'!]

320
00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:18,239
<i>Agents... have you been well?</i>

321
00:20:18,239 --> 00:20:19,419
He looks like her!

322
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:25,628
<i>I'm your superior officer,
the one in charge of all of MI-6, M.</i>

323
00:20:25,629 --> 00:20:27,281
M?

324
00:20:28,378 --> 00:20:31,379
<i>Since you're all gathered now,
I will give you your assignment.</i>

325
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:35,138
<i>I have prepared a field agent
evaluation for all of you today.</i>

326
00:20:35,977 --> 00:20:40,082
[Field agent evaluation mission?]

327
00:20:41,885 --> 00:20:48,368
<i>You have to pass this mission before
you can earn the title of being a 007 agent.</i>

328
00:20:48,369 --> 00:20:52,524
<i>I have already chosen the
teams for you.</i>

329
00:20:52,525 --> 00:20:56,455
<i>Yoo Jae Suk, Lee Kwang Soo,
and Agent Lee Seung Gi on one team.</i>

330
00:20:56,456 --> 00:21:01,008
<i>Kim Jong Kook, Ha Ha,
and Agent Park Shin Hye on one team.</i>

331
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:05,874
<i>And the rest, Song Ji Hyo, Ji Suk Jin
and Kang Gary on the last team.</i>

332
00:21:05,875 --> 00:21:10,863
<i>Take the train to get over to the
next location as quickly as possible.</i>

333
00:21:10,864 --> 00:21:13,319
<i>I wish you all luck.</i>

334
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,796
Then our team has
five points right now, right?

335
00:21:17,797 --> 00:21:21,118
[Team Seung Gi:
Jae Suk- 4 points + Kwang Soo- 1 point]

336
00:21:21,119 --> 00:21:22,118
- Three points.
- We have three points.

337
00:21:22,119 --> 00:21:23,854
We have zero points.

338
00:21:23,855 --> 00:21:25,928
How can you team us up like this?

339
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:30,841
<i>The quicker you clear the mission,
better advantage you'll have today.</i>

340
00:21:30,842 --> 00:21:33,309
<i>As for how the points are
going to work...</i>

341
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:36,238
<i>The team with five points will
be the first team to leave...</i>

342
00:21:36,239 --> 00:21:38,568
<i>and the second team to get started
will be the team with three points.</i>

343
00:21:39,051 --> 00:21:44,517
[Just how will this order work out...]

344
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:51,166
[To be the top secret agent, you
have to acquire the license to oust!]

345
00:21:52,001 --> 00:21:54,370
<i>- Do we just get going then?
- Of course.</i>

346
00:21:54,906 --> 00:21:56,561
I came on the show not knowing
anything.

347
00:21:56,561 --> 00:21:58,946
What is there to know? We
never know what's going on either.

348
00:21:58,947 --> 00:22:01,780
- We're on the same boat.
- So we're all the same then?

349
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:06,594
Wow... it really has been a
long time.

350
00:22:06,595 --> 00:22:11,262
- It really has been a long time, Seung Gi.
- I know. I'm really glad to see you too.

351
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:12,761
It really has been a long time
since I've seen Seung Gi.

352
00:22:12,761 --> 00:22:15,200
You two are talking way too much
amongst yourselves.

353
00:22:15,201 --> 00:22:18,325
[Giraffe feeling left out...]

354
00:22:18,326 --> 00:22:20,666
I forgot Kwang Soo's on our team too.

355
00:22:21,738 --> 00:22:25,095
- I'm just saying it's been too long...
- I'm really disappointed here.

356
00:22:25,096 --> 00:22:27,290
- Isn't he the Ace right now?
- Who?

357
00:22:27,291 --> 00:22:29,168
- Kwang Soo...
- Ah, Kwang Soo?

358
00:22:29,728 --> 00:22:32,956
- Kwang Soo...
- Why aren't you saying anything about it?

359
00:22:34,010 --> 00:22:35,677
Now that I realize it, you pay
no attention to me at all, do you?

360
00:22:37,284 --> 00:22:40,655
[Seung Gi's team - First to get on board]

361
00:22:40,655 --> 00:22:43,277
- Second team isn't getting on.
- Then it's just us?

362
00:22:43,278 --> 00:22:44,607
- Hello.
- Hello.

363
00:22:44,608 --> 00:22:48,003
- Have you ever taken this before?
- My Mother has taken it by my house.

364
00:22:48,004 --> 00:22:50,618
- She said it's really nice.
- You can see everything from here.

365
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:52,179
Really?

366
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:54,510
I had no idea that Running Man started
filming so early in the morning like this.

367
00:22:54,511 --> 00:22:57,848
Running so early in the morning
may not be so good for your health.

368
00:22:59,413 --> 00:23:00,871
Talk to him for us.

369
00:23:00,872 --> 00:23:03,233
No matter how much I try to talk to him,
he never seems to listen.

370
00:23:03,234 --> 00:23:06,117
No matter how I talk to him... and even
though I tell him my heart's pounding...

371
00:23:06,118 --> 00:23:09,735
[Even though it's been awhile, falling
right in sync with their conversation.]

372
00:23:09,736 --> 00:23:12,340
- When you run first thing in the morning...
- Oh yeah, Kwang Soo...

373
00:23:12,341 --> 00:23:14,988
You've totally turned your back on me.
You've just turned your back on me.

374
00:23:15,911 --> 00:23:18,789
It's just been so long since I've seen him.
You have to be a little understanding.

375
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:22,672
- You really are very tall.
- That's like the given line with everyone.

376
00:23:23,805 --> 00:23:26,359
Didn't you film X-Man with Seung Gi too?

377
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:30,893
[Happily reminiscing about old times with
many previous staff members of X-Man.]

378
00:23:30,894 --> 00:23:33,182
Can't we stop talking about X-Man?

379
00:23:34,236 --> 00:23:35,933
Let's just talk about Running Man.

380
00:23:35,934 --> 00:23:37,178
We're talking about Running Man too

381
00:23:37,178 --> 00:23:39,223
but it's just been so long since I've seen him
so we're just trying to catch up.

382
00:23:39,224 --> 00:23:40,658
I get that it's been a long time.

383
00:23:40,659 --> 00:23:43,252
- It's because we used to be so close.
- What? Aren't we close?

384
00:23:43,252 --> 00:23:45,508
- Yeah, we're close.
- You two seem like a good fit together.

385
00:23:45,509 --> 00:23:47,525
- Seung Gi and I...
- You mean, Kwang Soo?

386
00:23:47,526 --> 00:23:48,994
Did you call me Seung Gi just now?

387
00:23:48,995 --> 00:23:51,199
Your head is just full of
Seung Gi thoughts right now.

388
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,731
Actually, it's not just my head,
but all my body and all my heart...

389
00:23:54,732 --> 00:23:56,348
everything I am is just full of
thoughts of Seung Gi right now.

390
00:23:59,117 --> 00:24:02,065
- Where do we have to get off?
- I think we've got two more stops.

391
00:24:02,066 --> 00:24:05,331
- How do you know there are two stops left?
- Do you see the blinking light here?

392
00:24:06,244 --> 00:24:08,578
Ah... this is how it's moving?

393
00:24:08,579 --> 00:24:10,793
You don't know much, do you?

394
00:24:11,342 --> 00:24:14,364
I thought this whole section
was where we are right now.

395
00:24:14,365 --> 00:24:18,861
Since Seung Gi doesn't get a chance
to get downtown much...

396
00:24:19,572 --> 00:24:22,209
Are you a little country or something?

397
00:24:22,913 --> 00:24:24,964
Wait... or is it that he just doesn't know?

398
00:24:24,965 --> 00:24:27,418
He could just be a little unaware
instead of saying he's country.

399
00:24:27,419 --> 00:24:30,677
- But that's a little...
- You're too harsh with your words.

400
00:24:30,678 --> 00:24:32,821
Why are you talking to Seung Gi
like that?

401
00:24:33,393 --> 00:24:35,000
Jae Suk, it's me!

402
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:38,043
I'm getting tears in my eyes.

403
00:24:42,215 --> 00:24:44,300
- What is this?
- Is that a car wash?

404
00:24:44,301 --> 00:24:48,752
- What is this?
- The car wash must be our mission.

405
00:24:51,094 --> 00:24:53,783
- Wait... but why the car wash?
- Do we have to do something physical?

406
00:25:00,469 --> 00:25:02,628
[What kind of a mission could it be?]

407
00:25:02,629 --> 00:25:04,132
What is this?

408
00:25:06,531 --> 00:25:07,980
<i>Your mission...</i>

409
00:25:07,981 --> 00:25:09,206
That startled me.

410
00:25:09,848 --> 00:25:15,281
[What are M's orders this time?]

411
00:25:15,282 --> 00:25:17,774
[A required condition for the
most elite secret agents...]

412
00:25:17,774 --> 00:25:19,531
[A mission to test your agility.]

413
00:25:20,476 --> 00:25:22,228
Agility...

414
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:26,275
<i>Have you ever seen a car shootout
scene by a 007 agent?</i>

415
00:25:26,276 --> 00:25:27,458
Yes, of course...

416
00:25:27,459 --> 00:25:31,079
<i>Attacking his enemies from his car...</i>

417
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:35,890
<i>Shooting the targets from a moving car
with accurate aim from the water gun...</i>

418
00:25:35,891 --> 00:25:41,902
<i>I have prepared a water target practice
to test my agents' agility.</i>

419
00:25:41,903 --> 00:25:44,226
<i>You will be expected to shoot
the target precisely.</i>

420
00:25:44,227 --> 00:25:50,131
<i>And you'll have to roll the windows back up
quickly so that your clothes do not get wet.</i>

421
00:25:53,732 --> 00:25:58,047
So we have to shoot the guns, but when we
roll down the windows, we're going to get wet?

422
00:25:58,048 --> 00:26:00,646
- When we roll down the windows...
- When it's this cold out?

423
00:26:00,647 --> 00:26:02,796
- Seriously...
- What are we supposed to shoot?

424
00:26:04,715 --> 00:26:06,991
<i>That's why we've prepared
rain gear for all of you.</i>

425
00:26:06,992 --> 00:26:09,296
<i>The water is going to be fired at you
about every five seconds.</i>

426
00:26:09,297 --> 00:26:11,726
But are we really going to become
007 agents after we do this?

427
00:26:12,717 --> 00:26:15,470
I had no idea that 007 agents did their
training at a car wash like this.

428
00:26:15,471 --> 00:26:17,584
So this is how they get their training.

429
00:26:17,585 --> 00:26:20,031
If you're ordering us to do it,
we'll have to work hard to get it done.

430
00:26:23,430 --> 00:26:26,396
So this is why I was told not to
bother getting dressed up for the show?

431
00:26:26,397 --> 00:26:30,074
- Why did you put mousse in your hair?
- I used a whole can of hairspray on my hair.

432
00:26:30,648 --> 00:26:32,369
I was afraid of it getting messed up
from all the running.

433
00:26:33,159 --> 00:26:35,618
Agents... let's go!

434
00:26:35,618 --> 00:26:37,621
My hat is a little...

435
00:26:38,655 --> 00:26:41,691
[Agent Seung Gi as same as
his reputation that precedes him.]

436
00:26:41,692 --> 00:26:44,497
- What are we supposed to shoot?
- We're supposed to shoot those?

437
00:26:44,498 --> 00:26:47,281
<i>If you shoot four of those within
40 seconds, then you pass the mission.</i>

438
00:26:47,282 --> 00:26:53,043
[If they can knock down four empty cans within
40 seconds, then they pass the mission!]

439
00:26:53,044 --> 00:26:54,866
40 seconds, wow...

440
00:26:56,150 --> 00:26:58,879
<i>Your first mission, you have
40 seconds.</i>

441
00:27:00,236 --> 00:27:02,780
- Fighting!
- No, not yet!

442
00:27:02,781 --> 00:27:05,628
[Being startled into opening the
car door.]

443
00:27:06,689 --> 00:27:08,500
You scared Seung Gi.

444
00:27:10,593 --> 00:27:12,678
Oh, you were saying 'Fighting'...
okay.

445
00:27:14,826 --> 00:27:17,664
I was just acting out instinctively...

446
00:27:27,993 --> 00:27:32,447
- Get in! Get in!
- Kwang Soo! Shut the door!

447
00:27:32,447 --> 00:27:34,591
[A totally chaotic start]

448
00:27:35,814 --> 00:27:39,251
[If they let their guard down even in
the slightest bit, they'll be soaked.]

449
00:27:40,443 --> 00:27:43,867
[If you're going to shoot,
you have to lower the windows...]

450
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:47,091
Lower the window!

451
00:27:50,383 --> 00:27:51,898
Lower the window!

452
00:27:53,486 --> 00:27:56,470
[Shooting distance falling short
from not having pumped the gun enough.]

453
00:27:57,176 --> 00:27:58,985
I'm not getting any distance!

454
00:27:58,986 --> 00:28:00,049
Ah, this is how it works...

455
00:28:03,974 --> 00:28:06,813
- Where's your water gun?
- Give me my water gun!

456
00:28:06,814 --> 00:28:08,887
Give me my water gun!

457
00:28:09,481 --> 00:28:12,409
[Just then, Seung Gi!]

458
00:28:12,410 --> 00:28:17,588
[Taking an attempt at shooting
the targets!]

459
00:28:24,942 --> 00:28:26,797
[Fail]

460
00:28:36,341 --> 00:28:39,229
I figured out how to use the water gun
after 30 seconds elapsed.

461
00:28:40,105 --> 00:28:42,787
[I see...]

462
00:28:46,855 --> 00:28:48,979
Why didn't I get a water gun?

463
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:52,527
- Kwang Soo...
- Why didn't I get a water gun?

464
00:28:53,753 --> 00:28:55,641
<i>- Give me a water gun!
- I don't have your water gun!</i>

465
00:28:55,642 --> 00:28:57,485
[While the Giraffe was screaming
for his water gun...]

466
00:28:57,485 --> 00:29:00,299
[Here's the water gun?]

467
00:29:00,955 --> 00:29:04,949
[Give me a water gun too...]

468
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:06,827
Seung Gi, why were you sitting on
my water gun?

469
00:29:06,828 --> 00:29:09,669
- I'm sorry!
- Why were you sitting on my gun?

470
00:29:10,702 --> 00:29:13,306
Also, why weren't you closing
your window?

471
00:29:13,307 --> 00:29:18,178
- Why weren't you rolling up the window?
- Please shut the window, it's way too cold.

472
00:29:18,179 --> 00:29:20,428
- You need to roll up the window.
- And that's my fault?

473
00:29:20,429 --> 00:29:23,047
- Of course, it's your fault!
- You two are full out against me today!

474
00:29:23,048 --> 00:29:26,163
Shut the window. Seriously...

475
00:29:26,163 --> 00:29:29,673
We have to be quick with the water gun.
Seung Gi, you have to shoot right away.

476
00:29:29,674 --> 00:29:32,088
[After having tried it once,
seeming to have gotten the hold of it?]

477
00:29:32,089 --> 00:29:33,934
Instead of aiming,
I think I'm just going to pen fire.

478
00:29:33,935 --> 00:29:35,724
Just start shooting.

479
00:29:42,118 --> 00:29:44,922
- Oh my goodness!
- It's so cold!

480
00:29:44,923 --> 00:29:46,709
So cold! So cold!

481
00:29:47,156 --> 00:29:49,588
Shut the window!
You have to shut your window!

482
00:29:49,589 --> 00:29:51,122
It's so cold!

483
00:29:51,123 --> 00:29:54,430
[Giraffe being doused
with the water full in the face.]

484
00:29:54,431 --> 00:29:57,012
Shut the window! Kwang Soo!

485
00:30:00,450 --> 00:30:03,575
[Concentrating their shots to the right!]

486
00:30:15,013 --> 00:30:18,449
[We told you, you can't be slow to shoot...]

487
00:30:19,618 --> 00:30:21,845
[Fail]

488
00:30:32,927 --> 00:30:34,934
- What are you doing?
- What are you guys doing?

489
00:30:35,945 --> 00:30:39,277
- This game is no joke!
- It's totally awful!

490
00:30:39,277 --> 00:30:40,993
[What to do?]

491
00:30:41,888 --> 00:30:45,228
What are we doing?
[Blue Team also finally arrives]

492
00:30:45,229 --> 00:30:46,842
Is it a water fight?

493
00:30:47,723 --> 00:30:49,480
Why are we doing a water fight
in the middle of winter?

494
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:51,870
Of course!

495
00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:55,292
Hey, we all...
we all have to work together.

496
00:30:55,293 --> 00:30:57,945
- We have to work together.
- Let's try a simulation.

497
00:30:57,946 --> 00:31:03,076
- We get in the car and shut the door...
- And Kwang Soo hands over the water guns.

498
00:31:03,077 --> 00:31:05,470
And I'll start by rolling up the windows.

499
00:31:05,471 --> 00:31:09,265
[A simulation which will be
no different than the real live action.]

500
00:31:09,266 --> 00:31:11,656
- And when the windows are rolled up...
- Just do it!

501
00:31:11,657 --> 00:31:13,502
Why are you talking so much?

502
00:31:13,503 --> 00:31:16,134
- He can't even take a joke...
- Seriously...

503
00:31:16,135 --> 00:31:17,723
[Mr. Capable having exhausted his patience.]

504
00:31:18,358 --> 00:31:20,163
All of us are standing around here
waiting for you guys right now.

505
00:31:21,725 --> 00:31:23,378
Yes, we understand!

506
00:31:23,379 --> 00:31:26,458
Ready... set... go!

507
00:31:26,459 --> 00:31:28,141
Go! Go! Go!

508
00:31:29,849 --> 00:31:32,906
[The speed of getting in the car
seem to have gotten quicker?]

509
00:31:32,907 --> 00:31:35,160
<i>They're late... they're being too slow!</i>

510
00:31:38,925 --> 00:31:41,328
[Succeeds in handing out all
the water guns.]

511
00:31:41,329 --> 00:31:44,318
[After feverishly charging up their guns...]

512
00:31:46,026 --> 00:31:49,062
[Giraffe getting shot in the face.]

513
00:31:54,055 --> 00:31:55,692
That's our Kwang Soo.

514
00:31:57,776 --> 00:32:00,371
[Just then, Seung Gi takes his aim.]

515
00:32:03,307 --> 00:32:04,802
[Oh?]

516
00:32:04,803 --> 00:32:07,149
[Seung Gi takes down one target!]

517
00:32:09,341 --> 00:32:12,823
[And the target right next to it too!]

518
00:32:16,732 --> 00:32:20,110
[Fall over...]

519
00:32:21,671 --> 00:32:25,093
[If you take too long,
it's time to get soaked!]

520
00:32:28,910 --> 00:32:31,878
[And the right side who hasn't been
able to knock a single one down yet.]

521
00:32:37,104 --> 00:32:39,138
I'm seriously going to end up
drinking all that water!

522
00:32:40,862 --> 00:32:43,869
- It's not working!
- You're not hitting anything.

523
00:32:54,137 --> 00:32:56,650
[Fail]

524
00:32:58,391 --> 00:33:01,560
- Were you just gargling?
- What were you doing that for?

525
00:33:01,561 --> 00:33:03,582
- I see that you're gargling.
- Do you need some toothpaste?

526
00:33:03,583 --> 00:33:06,913
- Aren't you just so clean?
- I drank way too much water.

527
00:33:08,879 --> 00:33:10,507
Can't you put some more water
in the guns for us?

528
00:33:12,518 --> 00:33:16,176
What are you going to do if I end up getting
a cold when I'm already not feeling so good?

529
00:33:16,177 --> 00:33:17,937
You're going to have to keep working
with your cold then.

530
00:33:17,938 --> 00:33:21,937
- What did you say?
- A show does have to go on...

531
00:33:24,103 --> 00:33:25,424
Ready...

532
00:33:26,284 --> 00:33:29,031
Go! Go! Go!
Move! Move!

533
00:33:38,188 --> 00:33:41,871
[Total chaos out of the blue.]

534
00:33:44,382 --> 00:33:46,897
[If you hesitate,
you'll get soaked right away!]

535
00:33:49,497 --> 00:33:51,403
- He's so ugly!
- He really is so ugly.

536
00:33:51,404 --> 00:33:53,531
You're very unattractive.

537
00:33:53,532 --> 00:33:55,223
[A straight shot into the ugly face!]

538
00:34:02,939 --> 00:34:05,682
[Kkuk only worrying about
defending himself.]

539
00:34:09,435 --> 00:34:12,097
[Facing the mission head on out of rage.]

540
00:34:12,098 --> 00:34:14,127
[Oh?]

541
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,926
[Oh? He knocks down both of his
targets!]

542
00:34:24,852 --> 00:34:26,783
[Switching his target to
the left immediately!]

543
00:34:26,784 --> 00:34:28,650
Look at Kim Jong Kook!

544
00:34:28,651 --> 00:34:32,040
[Kkuk shooting at his targets
very passively.]

545
00:34:33,162 --> 00:34:35,184
[Fail]

546
00:34:35,185 --> 00:34:37,986
I was aiming at the targets,
but my stream won't reach.

547
00:34:40,141 --> 00:34:42,015
Ha Ha did really well.

548
00:34:42,016 --> 00:34:44,469
[Battling head on - Sharpshooter, Haroro.]

549
00:34:45,538 --> 00:34:47,373
Hey, that was cool! You look sexy!

550
00:34:47,374 --> 00:34:50,167
[I did good, right?]

551
00:34:50,168 --> 00:34:51,778
Really?

552
00:34:51,779 --> 00:34:54,574
Put your water guns back.
You can't take it out of the car.

553
00:34:54,575 --> 00:34:55,378
Whether we take it out of the car or not,
we've already seen how it's done.

554
00:34:56,656 --> 00:35:00,980
How could I not when the people before
us left looking the way they did?

555
00:35:00,981 --> 00:35:03,969
- Take a look at them right now.
- Why? We're fine.

556
00:35:03,970 --> 00:35:06,225
- No, I'm not okay.
- It's really fun.

557
00:35:06,966 --> 00:35:10,225
<i>Ready... set... go!</i>

558
00:35:12,761 --> 00:35:14,722
<i>They're late even with opening
the door.</i>

559
00:35:16,357 --> 00:35:18,474
[Getting soaked right away without
even being able to shut the door.]

560
00:35:20,347 --> 00:35:22,320
That's so funny!

561
00:35:24,188 --> 00:35:27,776
[Oh? Facing it head on?]

562
00:35:35,227 --> 00:35:37,955
[The force of the water not even
allowing him to open his eyes.]

563
00:35:37,956 --> 00:35:39,338
[Rolling up the window even when
the water attack is over?]

564
00:35:39,339 --> 00:35:42,503
He rolls up the window
after getting soaked first.

565
00:35:42,504 --> 00:35:45,854
[Leaning out to shoot precisely at the moment
that he's being attacked by the water...]

566
00:35:47,955 --> 00:35:49,313
[Rolling up the window again]

567
00:35:51,562 --> 00:35:53,772
Suk Jin, that's not how you do it.
You have to do it the opposite way.

568
00:35:55,352 --> 00:35:57,936
[Timing it at the same time
as the water attack again.]

569
00:36:03,899 --> 00:36:05,985
[Rolls up the window again...]

570
00:36:07,503 --> 00:36:09,506
All he's done is get soaked in
the face.

571
00:36:10,291 --> 00:36:14,859
[Just then, Miss Blank...]

572
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:17,146
[Wow! Knocks one down!]

573
00:36:22,418 --> 00:36:25,252
[Without hesitation, one more!]

574
00:36:26,631 --> 00:36:31,873
[Will Miss Blank...]

575
00:36:41,579 --> 00:36:42,677
[Fail]

576
00:36:42,677 --> 00:36:44,015
[Rolling it up again?]

577
00:36:45,539 --> 00:36:47,675
Wow... he really is so bad at this.

578
00:36:48,301 --> 00:36:50,722
- Ji Hyo's the best at it.
- The other two awful, aren't they?

579
00:36:50,723 --> 00:36:52,564
I didn't know that Suk Jin
would be that bad.

580
00:36:56,742 --> 00:37:00,297
[Agent Big-nose's eyes have turned red.]

581
00:37:01,744 --> 00:37:04,234
He sticks his head out the door
when he's being shot at with water

582
00:37:04,235 --> 00:37:06,544
and he rolls up the window when
he's not being shot with the water.

583
00:37:10,121 --> 00:37:12,211
I'm going to do it the right way
this time.

584
00:37:12,212 --> 00:37:15,967
[You know him, right? Yoo-ames Bond...]

585
00:37:15,968 --> 00:37:18,778
- Let's go! Let's go!
- Go! Go!

586
00:37:18,779 --> 00:37:21,888
- Muba! Muba!
- Fighting!

587
00:37:27,234 --> 00:37:28,502
<i>Ready...</i>

588
00:37:33,553 --> 00:37:36,318
I think the speed of
my movements have improved.

589
00:37:36,319 --> 00:37:38,339
Do 007 agents really do these
kind of things?

590
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:40,216
Do they get this kind of training
in England too?

591
00:37:42,059 --> 00:37:43,728
<i>Ready... set... go!</i>

592
00:37:46,543 --> 00:37:49,462
[Huh? In the back?]

593
00:37:52,943 --> 00:37:56,211
Move over! Make some space for me!

594
00:37:58,848 --> 00:38:00,398
Give me my water gun! My water gun!

595
00:38:00,399 --> 00:38:02,067
Water gun!

596
00:38:02,559 --> 00:38:06,106
[Seung Gi opening his window
with lightning speed.]

597
00:38:06,107 --> 00:38:08,164
[Knocks one down!]

598
00:38:11,813 --> 00:38:13,355
Seung Gi's really good!

599
00:38:13,356 --> 00:38:15,509
Why isn't any water coming out?

600
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:17,178
[Help me!]

601
00:38:17,179 --> 00:38:18,761
Give me the gun!

602
00:38:19,533 --> 00:38:22,374
[While the other end is struggling...]

603
00:38:22,879 --> 00:38:26,045
[Seung Gi shooting at his
remaining target.]

604
00:38:29,139 --> 00:38:30,910
[Hit]

605
00:38:32,179 --> 00:38:34,091
[Wow! Seung Gi knocks both of
them down!]

606
00:38:36,732 --> 00:38:40,272
[Targeting the other side immediately!]

607
00:38:40,273 --> 00:38:43,035
[There's not much time...]

608
00:38:47,969 --> 00:38:50,527
[Fail]

609
00:38:51,082 --> 00:38:55,057
- The water gun is a little...
- Look at them.

610
00:38:55,058 --> 00:38:58,809
Wait... seriously, wait...

611
00:38:58,810 --> 00:39:02,771
He looks just like the stone statues
on Jeju Island, doesn't he?

612
00:39:02,771 --> 00:39:06,092
[Big-nosed statue?]

613
00:39:06,093 --> 00:39:07,606
- Doesn't he look just like them?
- Yeah!

614
00:39:07,607 --> 00:39:09,580
And look, here's Yoda.

615
00:39:10,538 --> 00:39:13,528
[Confirmed to be in the sequel?]

616
00:39:13,529 --> 00:39:14,716
<i>Go!</i>

617
00:39:14,716 --> 00:39:16,787
Jong Kook, you're too slow!

618
00:39:16,788 --> 00:39:18,994
Jong Kook needs to get something.

619
00:39:19,933 --> 00:39:22,493
Fine! Fine!

620
00:39:23,469 --> 00:39:25,381
[Facing off head-on without any
hesitation.]

621
00:39:28,758 --> 00:39:30,959
[Knocks one down]

622
00:39:33,076 --> 00:39:35,291
[Oh! Agent Shin Hye also knocks
one down!]

623
00:39:36,895 --> 00:39:38,852
[Gets attacked by the water.]

624
00:39:40,227 --> 00:39:42,133
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!

625
00:39:42,637 --> 00:39:44,476
[Pumping up her gun while avoiding
the water.]

626

[If they can knock just one more down!]

628
00:40:00,161 --> 00:40:04,611
[Will they be the first to pass the mission?]

629
00:40:07,002 --> 00:40:08,864
You have to pump the gun more!
Pump it more!

[Shin Hye eyeing the last remaining
target.]

631
00:40:23,582 --> 00:40:25,333

[Yellow Team succeeds
during their second attempt!]

I'm stuck, Dong Hoon.

[Agent Kkuk with his body stuck
in the window.]

Wait, roll down the window.

Just rip the door off and
get out of it!

641
00:40:57,460 --> 00:40:59,821
- I know you can tear that door off.
- What are you doing right now?

642
00:40:59,822 --> 00:41:02,212
I got it.
My body was stuck in there.

643
00:41:03,185 --> 00:41:05,631
You need to shrink down your
body somehow.

644
00:41:05,632 --> 00:41:08,376
[The window is busted...]

645
00:41:10,874 --> 00:41:12,826
<i>The window isn't going to shut
like that now.</i>

646

Look at this! You ruined the car!

648

The window won't...
Hey, we can't even shut the window now.

649
00:41:20,998 --> 00:41:22,086
Really?

650
00:41:22,087 --> 00:41:25,212
- What are we supposed to do now?
- What was I supposed to do then? I was stuck!

651

You have no game etiquette,
no etiquette.

- I'll try to fix it.

Fine, I'll just fix it then.

654

Why are you getting so angry over this?
This isn't so bad!

655

her best effort in without any hesitation.

- Second, second...

roll up the windows.

673
00:42:35,534 --> 00:42:37,512

through the back like that?

- Give me a gun!

all my energy right from the get go.

The most important thing to remember
is that we've only played one game.

00:55:48,262 --> 00:55:50,712
[Oh! Did they succeed?]

836
00:55:52,123 --> 00:55:53,706
- You passed.
- Pass!

837
00:55:53,707 --> 00:55:56,342
- You passed.
- Pass!

838
00:56:04,362 --> 00:56:07,637
[Diving into the water to celebrate.]

839
00:56:12,471 --> 00:56:15,557
<i>I feel like we've just been freed
from incarceration.</i>

840
00:56:17,853 --> 00:56:20,600
I feel so happy to be in first place.

841
00:56:20,601 --> 00:56:23,676
The next location is a cafe...

842
00:56:23,677 --> 00:56:27,308
[The next location is a cafe,
perhaps there will be food there?]

843
00:56:27,309 --> 00:56:29,780
- Some brunch or lunch would be nice.
- Yeah, it would.

844
00:56:29,781 --> 00:56:32,638
- Doesn't your arm hurt at all?
- No, it doesn't. Why?

845
00:56:33,038 --> 00:56:34,928
It was the first time
I had to pump a water gun.

846
00:56:34,929 --> 00:56:37,109
Pumping the water gun like that...

847
00:56:39,811 --> 00:56:43,896
[The Blue Team also succeeded.
Yellow Team is the only one left...]

848
00:56:51,146 --> 00:56:53,172
[You got it wrong...]

849
00:56:58,851 --> 00:57:00,365
[Mommy...]

850
00:57:07,651 --> 00:57:09,290
You idiot!

851
00:57:09,291 --> 00:57:10,855
Why can't you say it right?

852
00:57:10,856 --> 00:57:12,411
How could you have gotten that wrong?

853
00:57:15,975 --> 00:57:17,644
What to do...

854
00:57:18,617 --> 00:57:21,100
[Oh my goodness...]

855
00:57:23,706 --> 00:57:26,572
[Need to concentrate some more...]

856
00:57:42,464 --> 00:57:45,498
[Finally succeeds!]

857
00:57:47,628 --> 00:57:49,481
Oh my goodness!

858
00:57:54,123 --> 00:57:55,791
Shin Hye, where are you going?

859
00:57:58,035 --> 00:58:01,029
[Red Team arrives at
the next mission location.]

860
00:58:01,900 --> 00:58:03,237
This is the place.

861
00:58:05,699 --> 00:58:08,858
[What kind of a mission awaits them
inside the cafe?]

862
00:58:09,849 --> 00:58:13,670
[Blue Team follows behind and
arrives soon thereafter.]

863
00:58:13,671 --> 00:58:15,293
They beat us here.

864
00:58:16,215 --> 00:58:21,154
<i>I'm going to check how well you agents work
as a team when you're faced with danger.</i>

865
00:58:21,155 --> 00:58:23,332
<i>It's very simple.</i>

866
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:27,438
<i>You just need to pass through
the rig within 15 seconds.</i>

867
00:58:27,439 --> 00:58:31,701
<i>Okay... show me how well
you guys can work together.</i>

868
00:58:33,342 --> 00:58:37,888
[Just what kind of a rig
do they have to pass through?]

869
00:58:37,889 --> 00:58:40,572
- Physically...
- What?

870
00:58:41,867 --> 00:58:44,160
How can we do that within 15 seconds?

871
00:58:44,161 --> 00:58:47,136
[Tennis racket. A landing net.
A wire hanger.]

872
00:58:47,136 --> 00:58:50,138
- There's no way Kim Jong Kook can do this.
- It's over for them.

873
00:58:50,139 --> 00:58:52,249
<i>You can't try it now.</i>

874
00:58:52,250 --> 00:58:55,702
[Looks as though he may be
good at this mission?]

875
00:58:55,703 --> 00:58:59,523
- This is actually better than the other two.
- The three of us have good teamwork.

876
00:58:59,524 --> 00:59:01,511
- Let's go!
- This is what worries me the most.

877
00:59:03,096 --> 00:59:06,188
[Just then, the Yellow Team arrives.]

878
00:59:08,876 --> 00:59:16,264
[The other team is to mix-up the tools behind
them and the person up chooses randomly.]

879
00:59:17,577 --> 00:59:19,056
Okay, we're finished.

880
00:59:21,490 --> 00:59:25,420
- Tennis racket would be good for us, right?
- You want the tennis racket?

881
00:59:25,421 --> 00:59:27,833
- Should we pick now?
- One, two, three!

882
00:59:27,834 --> 00:59:28,985
<i>Two!</i>

883
00:59:28,986 --> 00:59:30,241
<i>Two!</i>

884
00:59:30,242 --> 00:59:33,145
[Red Team chooses the tennis racket!]

885
00:59:33,146 --> 00:59:37,227
[They did get what Seung Gi wanted...
but will they be able to do it?]

886
00:59:37,228 --> 00:59:39,544
- Number three would've been the best...
- That would've been better?

887
00:59:40,245 --> 00:59:44,035
- We can do this... I'll go first.
- Okay. You go first.

888
00:59:44,036 --> 00:59:45,798
- You really think you can do it?
- Yeah, I think I can do it.

889
00:59:46,935 --> 00:59:49,368
[Seung Gi looking confident]

890
00:59:49,369 --> 00:59:51,453
- Are you seriously going to be okay?
- I think I'm going to be okay.

891
00:59:53,978 --> 00:59:56,559
[Needs to pass within 15 seconds!]

892
00:59:56,559 --> 01:00:00,979
[M's mission to test their teamwork skills.
How will it turn out?]

893
01:00:00,980 --> 01:00:02,584
<i>Ready, set, go!</i>

894
01:00:04,603 --> 01:00:09,258
[Oh... Seung Gi, going as planned?]

895
01:00:10,838 --> 01:00:13,218
<i>You're fumbling here too,
aren't you?</i>

896
01:00:16,825 --> 01:00:18,787
Wait...

897
01:00:18,788 --> 01:00:22,394
Just stand still.
I said, stand still.

898
01:00:22,394 --> 01:00:26,283
[He really is stuck!]

899
01:00:26,284 --> 01:00:28,824
- I can't see how to undo this...
- Seung Gi, can you not get yourself out?

900
01:00:28,825 --> 01:00:31,345
Hey, you're acting like Kwang Soo.

901
01:00:32,353 --> 01:00:35,439
[Children and immature adults,
Please do not imitate!]

902
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:37,742
- Why did you want the tennis racket?
- I thought it was going to be easy.

903
01:00:37,743 --> 01:00:41,116
[But ultimately, he wasted time on his
own and failed the mission!]

904
01:00:41,117 --> 01:00:43,813
- I guess that's not going to work.
- 35 seconds passed already.

905
01:00:43,814 --> 01:00:46,868
[This is definitely Seung Gi's style...]

906
01:00:46,869 --> 01:00:48,829
We get to mix it up this time, right?

907
01:00:48,830 --> 01:00:52,112
- I'm sorry, but I think our team is a bit...
- If you're sorry, then just keep quiet.

908
01:00:52,113 --> 01:00:53,273
What did you say?

909
01:00:53,274 --> 01:00:54,867
Why you, seriously...

910
01:00:54,868 --> 01:00:58,599
Hey, Kwang Soo... hey...

911
01:00:58,600 --> 01:01:00,448
[Agony?]

912
01:01:00,449 --> 01:01:03,116
They said, no practice!
They said, no practice!

913
01:01:03,117 --> 01:01:04,498
- There's no practicing!
- I won't do it!

914
01:01:04,499 --> 01:01:08,353
[Tiger's sense of humor
which isn't actually all that funny.]

915
01:01:08,354 --> 01:01:09,884
What kind of humor is that?

916
01:01:09,885 --> 01:01:13,106
[It's the Blue Team's turn at the challenge!]

917
01:01:13,693 --> 01:01:16,919
[Red Team trying to
raise their level of confusion.]

918
01:01:17,730 --> 01:01:20,231
You're not going to move anything
after causing all that noise, right?

919
01:01:22,784 --> 01:01:26,585
- I get it, I get it...
- Okay, I think I get it.

920
01:01:27,317 --> 01:01:29,627
One, two, three... number three!

921
01:01:29,628 --> 01:01:34,279
Number three!
[Chooses the wire hanger!]

922
01:01:34,279 --> 01:01:36,380
You really did leave it just
the way it was.

923
01:01:37,364 --> 01:01:39,174
That one's not easy either.

924
01:01:39,175 --> 01:01:40,568
<i>You have 15 seconds.</i>

925
01:01:40,569 --> 01:01:43,155
[All three members of the Blue Team have to
pass through the hanger in 15 seconds!]

926
01:01:43,156 --> 01:01:44,511
[Start]

927
01:01:44,894 --> 01:01:48,436
[Targeting the hanger
as soon as the buzzer sounds!]

928
01:01:50,247 --> 01:01:52,683
Wait... wait!

929
01:01:52,684 --> 01:01:54,615
[Show!]

930
01:01:54,616 --> 01:01:55,679
Wait!

931
01:01:55,679 --> 01:01:58,897
Wait! I'm stuck!

932
01:02:02,669 --> 01:02:05,163
[Kang Gary is flexible!]

933
01:02:10,917 --> 01:02:13,325
Wait... my pants are falling down!

934
01:02:13,326 --> 01:02:15,010
My pants are falling down. Wait!

935
01:02:15,011 --> 01:02:18,868
[Keeping at it without even knowing
the time is already up... warning!]

936
01:02:18,869 --> 01:02:22,317
[Pausing the game due to
pulled down pants!]

937
01:02:24,577 --> 01:02:29,168
Kang Gary... you're wearing yellow
underwear! I saw it!

938
01:02:29,980 --> 01:02:33,035
- Why did you have to...
- Did you see it?

939
01:02:33,036 --> 01:02:35,789
- Seriously...
- It's a color you like, isn't it?

940
01:02:37,932 --> 01:02:40,191
[Ugh, my head...]

941
01:02:41,414 --> 01:02:45,641
[Hanger challenge showing us
that it's possible to win.]

942
01:02:45,642 --> 01:02:48,075
Tennis racket is the worst, right?
The tennis racket?

943
01:02:48,076 --> 01:02:52,078
[Needing to come up with a good plan
after seeing what the other team did.]

944
01:02:52,079 --> 01:02:54,972
[Carefully formulating a plan]

945
01:02:56,335 --> 01:02:59,801
[Yellow Team's turn to choose their tool.]

946
01:02:59,802 --> 01:03:03,342
[Yellow Team chooses the tennis racket]

947
01:03:04,151 --> 01:03:08,263
[Will Mr. Capable be able to get
it around his body?]

948
01:03:08,264 --> 01:03:10,706
If I can't get through it,
then we fail, right?

949
01:03:10,707 --> 01:03:13,971
I will show all of you that I'm
slimmer than what all of you think.

950
01:03:13,972 --> 01:03:16,523
Ready... set... go!

951
01:03:19,780 --> 01:03:21,682
[Shin Hye passes through it
with ease.]

952
01:03:21,683 --> 01:03:23,287
Shin Hye's really skinny!

953
01:03:23,288 --> 01:03:24,748
[That's amazing]

954
01:03:26,098 --> 01:03:28,025
[And how will Ha Ha do?]

955
01:03:33,893 --> 01:03:36,244
[Even Haroro passes through it
after having lost some weight!]

956
01:03:36,245 --> 01:03:41,375
[And finally, it's Mr. Capable's turn!
Will he be able to do it?]

957
01:03:43,372 --> 01:03:46,007
[Time over! Fail.]

958
01:03:46,008 --> 01:03:49,704
[Just as predicted,
it gets caught at the shoulders.]

959
01:03:49,705 --> 01:03:52,192
It won't go through!
What the heck...

960
01:03:52,193 --> 01:03:53,938
What the heck is this?

961
01:03:53,939 --> 01:03:58,052
[A funny scene for those
watching him try.]

962
01:04:00,039 --> 01:04:03,888
[It's obvious that Mr. Capable will
be the worst at this mission?]

963
01:04:03,889 --> 01:04:05,992
[Those muscles are just useless!]

964
01:04:06,405 --> 01:04:11,473
[Body parts that are caught:
Trapezius, triceps, rear lat back muscles.]

965
01:04:11,474 --> 01:04:13,743
And it was caught over here too.

966
01:04:13,744 --> 01:04:16,485
[This is a game
where we can beat Mr. Capable!]

967
01:04:18,077 --> 01:04:22,834
[Red Team's turn.
Yellow Team mixing up the tools.]

968
01:04:22,835 --> 01:04:24,572
- It's number two. Trust me.
- Number two?

969
01:04:24,573 --> 01:04:26,795
- Okay, call you on number two.
- Number two!

970
01:04:26,796 --> 01:04:30,110
[Red Team chooses the wire hanger!]

971
01:04:30,823 --> 01:04:34,150
[Tennis racket was a fail!
Will they succeed with the hanger?]

972
01:04:34,151 --> 01:04:36,825
<i>Ready... set...</i>

973
01:04:41,701 --> 01:04:43,440
- You got it!
- There it is!

974
01:04:48,810 --> 01:04:51,673
[Did the Giraffe build up some
chest muscles?]

975
01:04:51,674 --> 01:04:52,916
Hey...

976
01:05:00,539 --> 01:05:03,446
[Time over! Fail!]

977
01:05:07,430 --> 01:05:12,363
[Is he pulling down the hanger
or his pants?]

978
01:05:13,456 --> 01:05:16,214
[Having no other choice but to
pull it back up towards his head.]

979
01:05:16,215 --> 01:05:18,641
- You have to relax.
- That's right. Don't tense yourself up.

980
01:05:18,642 --> 01:05:21,840
[Why is his expression changing like
that after being told to relax?]

981
01:05:21,841 --> 01:05:24,062
Don't you think that the three of us
are getting a little too close?

982
01:05:24,786 --> 01:05:28,722
[Next is the Blue Team's turn
after having chosen the landing net.]

983
01:05:28,723 --> 01:05:32,059
- Wait...
- Ready...

984
01:05:38,823 --> 01:05:40,536
Suk Jin, hurry! Hurry!

985
01:05:40,537 --> 01:05:43,967
[Slim Ji Hyo passes through in a flash!
Next up is Suk Jin!]

986
01:05:46,578 --> 01:05:48,162
[Anyways, Suk Jin also passes!]

987
01:05:48,163 --> 01:05:50,484
[And lastly, it's Gary's turn!]

988
01:05:52,189 --> 01:05:55,288
[Too bad!
The time's up and they fail!]

989
01:05:57,251 --> 01:06:00,912
[Much easier than the hanger!
The landing net is good!]

990
01:06:02,705 --> 01:06:06,081
[Excited at having discovered
a new tool to work with!]

991
01:06:06,082 --> 01:06:08,993
[Seung Gi starting to whisper
his next plan.]

992
01:06:08,994 --> 01:06:13,580
[Will everything go according to
Seung Gi's plan when it's their turn?]

993
01:06:16,040 --> 01:06:19,329
[Next up is the Yellow Team.]

994
01:06:24,059 --> 01:06:27,214
[Listening to the sounds...]

995
01:06:32,877 --> 01:06:35,240
- Okay, we're ready!
- One, two, three... number two!

996
01:06:35,241 --> 01:06:39,731
Number two!
[Yellow Team picks the landing net!]

997
01:06:43,114 --> 01:06:45,002
<i>Ready... set... go!</i>

998
01:06:47,585 --> 01:06:49,963
[Shin Hye passes through in a flash!]

999
01:06:52,520 --> 01:06:54,291
[The foot!]

1000
01:06:54,292 --> 01:06:55,975
It's caught! It's caught!

1001
01:07:00,578 --> 01:07:02,666
[Now only Mr. Capable is left to go!]

1002
01:07:02,667 --> 01:07:05,897
[Landing net with the possibilities...
Will it work this time around?]

1003
01:07:10,320 --> 01:07:13,699
[Time's up! Fail!]

1004
01:07:14,513 --> 01:07:16,937
Just rip all this off! Rip it off!

1005
01:07:16,938 --> 01:07:21,835
[His muscles that are
rendered useless all day...]

1006
01:07:22,261 --> 01:07:25,661
[Next up is the Red Team who
ended up picking the tennis racket.]

1007
01:07:27,390 --> 01:07:30,644
[Brain Seung Gi with another good idea.]

1008
01:07:30,645 --> 01:07:34,520
[Will they succeed as he foresees
in his plan?]

1009
01:07:34,521 --> 01:07:37,444
Ready... set... go!

1010
01:07:41,259 --> 01:07:44,319
[Ah... lowering the
one shoulder to pull down...]

1011
01:07:44,320 --> 01:07:48,489
[This is Seung Gi's good idea?]

1012
01:07:50,549 --> 01:07:52,676
[The tennis racket
undoubtedly getting caught!]

1013
01:07:52,677 --> 01:07:54,857
It's caught on your shoulder.
It's caught.

1014
01:07:55,934 --> 01:07:58,636
[Change of plans!
Working from bottoms up?]

1015
01:08:03,670 --> 01:08:06,268
[Time's up! Fail!]

1016
01:08:06,269 --> 01:08:09,132
I thought that Seung Gi was really clever,
when I saw Kwang Soo doing this.

1017
01:08:09,772 --> 01:08:11,588
You helped me come up with the plan.

1018
01:08:11,589 --> 01:08:14,954
[This is the plan that they've been
whispering together about?]

1019
01:08:14,955 --> 01:08:17,996
Wow, don't you look stylish! Gary...

1020
01:08:17,997 --> 01:08:19,926
Your legs look so long right now.

1021
01:08:20,907 --> 01:08:25,463
[Simple Gary... not even
knowing that he's being teased...]

1022
01:08:27,847 --> 01:08:30,966
[Blue Team chooses the landing gear
and starting the challenge!]

1023
01:08:30,967 --> 01:08:33,178
[Start]

1024
01:08:36,879 --> 01:08:39,286
[Suk Jin passes! Gary's turn!]

1025
01:08:42,496 --> 01:08:44,697
[Now if they can get
Blank Ji to pass through...]

1026
01:08:44,698 --> 01:08:49,627
[Plenty of time! If she passes,
they place first for this mission!]

1027
01:08:54,205 --> 01:08:58,666
[12 seconds!
Blue Team succeeds the mission!]

1028
01:09:03,217 --> 01:09:05,183
- How many seconds was that?
- 12 seconds.

1029
01:09:05,184 --> 01:09:08,605
[Great teamwork!
Succeeding in mere 12 seconds!]

1030
01:09:09,508 --> 01:09:12,739
[Seung Gi getting upset because
things aren't going according to his plans.]

1031
01:09:17,775 --> 01:09:21,527
[Blue Team heading to the final location
since placing first with the mission.]

1032
01:09:25,608 --> 01:09:30,124
[The final location - Art Center in Yong-In!]

1033
01:09:30,125 --> 01:09:32,043
- We're in first place!
- We're in first place right now.

1034
01:09:32,044 --> 01:09:33,743
- Wow... this is awesome.
- Yong-In?

1035
01:09:37,746 --> 01:09:43,582
[That's the only sound they can think of
to cover up the sound of tools being moved.]

1036
01:09:43,583 --> 01:09:45,323
- Are you done?
- We're done.

1037
01:09:45,324 --> 01:09:48,145
Jong Kook... want to pick number two?

1038
01:09:48,146 --> 01:09:50,028
- Okay, let's do it!
- Which number?

1039
01:09:50,029 --> 01:09:53,329
- Wait, wait...
- No, you can't. Number two!

1040
01:09:53,330 --> 01:09:55,499
Number two! It is, isn't it?

1041
01:09:55,500 --> 01:09:57,625
[Bingo]

1042
01:10:10,454 --> 01:10:12,155
[Mr. Capable did it!]

1043
01:10:14,163 --> 01:10:15,577
[Shin Hye does it with ease.]

1044
01:10:15,578 --> 01:10:17,827
[Now only if Ha Ha can get it done!]

1045
01:10:21,932 --> 01:10:26,110
[13 seconds!
Yellow Team succeeds the mission!]

1046
01:10:29,237 --> 01:10:31,235
It just went right through!

1047
01:10:31,384 --> 01:10:34,804
[After all that planning,
ultimately ending up in last place.]

1048
01:10:34,805 --> 01:10:37,020
Oh my... you're in last place?

1049
01:10:38,769 --> 01:10:42,473
[Since they're already in last place,
trying it out as they had planned...]

1050
01:10:43,011 --> 01:10:45,498
Ouch! Wait...

1051
01:10:45,744 --> 01:10:47,874
It's not working. It's not working...

1052
01:10:47,875 --> 01:10:52,484
[Ultimately, Seung Gi's plans
are rendered useless...]

1053
01:10:53,957 --> 01:10:56,685
- It wasn't working.
- Ah, seriously...

1054
01:10:56,686 --> 01:10:59,599
And we were wrong with our
train of thoughts.

1055
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:02,442
- To think that it would be so simple.
- I'm sorry for that.

1056
01:11:02,443 --> 01:11:05,892
To be honest, my strategies have
never really worked during games.

1057
01:11:06,687 --> 01:11:08,212
I'm sorry, but can you just stay
quiet then?

1058
01:11:08,213 --> 01:11:11,102
I knew it...
you really are a bumbly.

1059
01:11:13,032 --> 01:11:16,231
I was going to act like the brain of
this operation on the show today...

1060
01:11:17,477 --> 01:11:19,256
But it sounded feasible
when I was talking about it, right?

1061
01:11:19,257 --> 01:11:21,429
- Yeah, it totally sounded plausible.
- Yeah, I fell for it.

1062
01:11:21,430 --> 01:11:23,408
- I thought your plans were going to work.
- I thought that way too.

1063
01:11:23,409 --> 01:11:26,478
- Hey... this is our last chance at a win.
- To lean over like this...

1064
01:11:26,479 --> 01:11:29,891
We will do whatever it takes to make sure
that you take home the gold today.

1065
01:11:29,892 --> 01:11:32,148
- Really?
- Yeah, don't worry about it. Gold!

1066
01:11:32,149 --> 01:11:33,672
Gold medal...

1067
01:11:35,034 --> 01:11:38,727
[The final mission location-
Yong-In Art Hall!]

1068
01:11:38,727 --> 01:11:41,399
- I have a very good feeling about today.
- We're one step closer to victory.

1069
01:11:44,014 --> 01:11:48,866
[A gigantic screen...
M to give out another order soon?]

1070
01:11:49,740 --> 01:11:51,658
<i>Your final mission.</i>

1071
01:11:51,659 --> 01:11:53,202
<i>Your final mission.</i>

1072
01:11:53,203 --> 01:11:57,338
[The final passage for the secret agent
to pass their skills exam...]

1073
01:11:57,338 --> 01:12:01,855
[Water gun fight!]

1074
01:12:01,856 --> 01:12:03,812
<i>Water gun fight.</i>

1075
01:12:05,289 --> 01:12:06,622
It's water to the end!

1076
01:12:06,623 --> 01:12:08,358
<i>So starting now...</i>

1077
01:12:08,359 --> 01:12:11,927
<i>Find the water guns that have been
hidden around here for the agents</i>

1078
01:12:11,928 --> 01:12:14,985
<i>and target each other's name tags.</i>

1079
01:12:14,986 --> 01:12:19,309
<i>The team with the last surviving member
is the ultimate victor.</i>

1080
01:12:21,981 --> 01:12:25,146
- Suk Jin, we can do this.
- Yeah, we can do this.

1081
01:12:25,147 --> 01:12:28,094
Since we're the first ones to arrive here,
let's hurry and find the water guns.

1082
01:12:28,389 --> 01:12:31,458
[Need to hurry and find the
water guns.]

1083
01:12:31,459 --> 01:12:33,818
I'm positive that...

1084
01:12:36,205 --> 01:12:39,780
[The problem is...]

1085
01:12:39,781 --> 01:12:44,249
[There are a thousand water guns here!
But less than 10 of them are operational!]

1086
01:12:48,719 --> 01:12:50,467
Nothing's coming out.

1087
01:12:50,468 --> 01:12:53,143
So we just need to find working
water guns and shoot?

1088
01:12:54,495 --> 01:12:59,097
[Even though there are a lot of guns around,
only about 10 of them actually work!]

1089
01:13:01,595 --> 01:13:03,766
The front part of it is blocked.

1090
01:13:05,041 --> 01:13:07,175
There's no water in here.

1091
01:13:07,176 --> 01:13:10,140
[It's like trying to find
a needle in the haystack!]

1092
01:13:12,043 --> 01:13:13,767
What is it? What is it?

1093
01:13:14,767 --> 01:13:16,524
- It's a dud, isn't it?
- I know.

1094
01:13:18,372 --> 01:13:24,094
[Useful when it comes to bluffing
each other with fake water guns.]

1095
01:13:27,684 --> 01:13:29,497
We can't work in alliance, right?

1096
01:13:29,498 --> 01:13:32,216
- What?
- We can't be in alliance, right?

1097
01:13:32,217 --> 01:13:34,782
- We don't know that, Seung Gi.
- Really?

1098
01:13:34,783 --> 01:13:36,860
- Betrayal is always an option, right?
- Of course!

1099
01:13:36,861 --> 01:13:38,074
Betrayal is a given.

1100
01:13:38,075 --> 01:13:40,186
What fun is a variety show
if betrayal wasn't allowed?

1101
01:13:40,187 --> 01:13:43,459
- Want to work together?
- Hey, what if...

1102
01:13:51,328 --> 01:13:54,911
[Shin Hye working hard
to find the real water gun.]

1103
01:13:59,023 --> 01:14:01,429
There's no other way but to
try out each one.

1104
01:14:01,430 --> 01:14:04,816
[It shoots!]

1105
01:14:04,817 --> 01:14:07,939
[Yellow Team's Shin Hye
discovers a real water gun!]

1106
01:14:09,801 --> 01:14:11,234
What the heck!

1107
01:14:11,235 --> 01:14:12,764
Hey! Shin Hye!

1108
01:14:12,765 --> 01:14:14,626
Hey! What are you doing!

1109
01:14:24,368 --> 01:14:25,871
She found one?

1110
01:14:29,449 --> 01:14:30,998
Kwang Soo, run!

1111
01:14:30,999 --> 01:14:33,408
Why? Who is it? Who got one?

1112
01:14:33,409 --> 01:14:35,546
She found a water gun!

1113
01:14:39,552 --> 01:14:40,912
I can't believe I lost him!

1114
01:14:40,913 --> 01:14:43,254
[Agent Shin Hye who's able to attack
after having found a water gun!]

1115
01:14:43,255 --> 01:14:46,412
[Will she be able to survive to the end?]

1116
01:14:52,874 --> 01:14:57,179
[Not knowing if the other's gun is working,
both being cautious with each other.]

1117
01:14:57,180 --> 01:14:59,235
I can see that your water gun
is blocked!

1118
01:14:59,236 --> 01:15:01,149
Want to trade with me?

1119
01:15:01,150 --> 01:15:03,595
Want to trade with me?

1120
01:15:03,596 --> 01:15:08,417
[Mr. Capable in fear thinking
that he was going to be shot at...]

1121
01:15:14,326 --> 01:15:16,964
Oh... you have to push it open.

1122
01:15:20,558 --> 01:15:23,546
By now, someone could've
discovered a real one.

1123
01:15:23,547 --> 01:15:25,558
Are we allowed to take their
water guns?

1124
01:15:25,559 --> 01:15:27,684
Can we swipe the gun away
from them?

1125
01:15:27,685 --> 01:15:30,570
[If you think you can do it...]

1126
01:15:32,111 --> 01:15:35,479
[The doors are locked?]

1127
01:15:37,145 --> 01:15:39,075
Ah... this is how you open it.

1128
01:15:39,517 --> 01:15:41,288
Please, let me find just one.

1129
01:15:43,534 --> 01:15:47,520
[He's tried out every one of them he sees,
but they're all nonfunctional.]

1130
01:15:47,521 --> 01:15:49,335
There's some over there too.

1131
01:15:52,577 --> 01:15:54,381
That water gun looks good.

1132
01:15:54,382 --> 01:15:55,941
I wonder how this door opens?

1133
01:15:58,826 --> 01:16:00,597
It says I need to put 200 won in there?

1134
01:16:00,598 --> 01:16:03,078
[Huh?]

1135
01:16:03,079 --> 01:16:06,552
[Oh my... that was the product number...]

1136
01:16:09,929 --> 01:16:14,449
[Just as the rumor states,
Seung Gi is a bumbly who talks a lot...]

1137
01:16:15,501 --> 01:16:17,633
Wait... this one opens up like this.

1138
01:16:17,634 --> 01:16:20,084
Ah! This is how it works!

1139
01:16:21,517 --> 01:16:25,074
[Five minutes just to open up
the cabinet...]

1140
01:16:25,075 --> 01:16:27,109
The game is going to end before
I can find a working water gun.

1141
01:16:29,764 --> 01:16:33,127
[Hard at work,
going in to search the next room.]

1142
01:16:34,245 --> 01:16:38,869
This is actually hard. I can't
pump anymore after earlier today.

1143
01:16:38,870 --> 01:16:40,451
[His left arm getting sore from having to
pump the water guns to check them.]

1144
01:16:42,228 --> 01:16:45,177
[It seems as though a real water gun
is missing from this location as well.]

1145
01:16:45,178 --> 01:16:47,310
[I wonder if I should just give up...]

1146
01:16:48,268 --> 01:16:52,908
[Huh? That's...]

1147
01:16:56,676 --> 01:16:58,425
I wonder if this is a water gun too?

1148
01:17:05,730 --> 01:17:07,227
Is this a water gun?

1149
01:17:08,030 --> 01:17:10,946
[No matter! An ultimate weapon that is
like none other than a cannon!]

1150
01:17:10,947 --> 01:17:14,223
[Anyways, Red Team's Seung Gi
discovers a real water gun!]

1151
01:17:14,839 --> 01:17:16,107
Please just one...

1152
01:17:16,108 --> 01:17:18,896
Let me find just one.
Just once so that I can fight.

1153
01:17:21,993 --> 01:17:26,389
[Blue Team's Suk Jin
also finds a real water gun!]

1154
01:17:34,580 --> 01:17:36,024
Please...

1155
01:17:41,375 --> 01:17:43,924
[Water gun Master,
Yoo-ames Bond also discovers one!]

1156
01:17:44,414 --> 01:17:48,694
[One by one, real
water guns are being discovered.]

1157
01:17:48,695 --> 01:17:52,119
[The real fight begins now!]

1158
01:17:56,136 --> 01:17:59,258
- Oh my... Sir!
- Oh, so you were targeting me?

1159
01:17:59,259 --> 01:18:01,169
What are you talking about, Sir?

1160
01:18:04,045 --> 01:18:06,019
[How Yoo-ames Bond-like!]

1161
01:18:06,020 --> 01:18:09,703
[The skills of being a secret agent
has seeped into his bones...]

1162
01:18:10,775 --> 01:18:12,364
We'll see where this goes later.

1163

[Now is my chance!]

1164
01:18:26,261 --> 01:18:28,178
- Am I out?
- Out.

1165

[Clear evidence of a watermark!]

1166
01:18:33,060 --> 01:18:36,479
My water gun has never
missed its target.

[On the other hand,
Agent Seung Gi with his new weapon...]

[Mr. Capable, Ace and the Giraffe
all gathered in one place.]

1172
01:19:01,385 --> 01:19:03,287
Kwang Soo doesn't have a water gun...

1173
01:19:03,288 --> 01:19:06,852
[Seung Gi approaching slowly with
confidence with his weapon in hand...]

and Seung Gi immobile with his hand!]

[Pumping up his gun in this situation...]

1178

You really are something else...

1179
01:19:35,044 --> 01:19:37,760
Kwang Soo, why did you
let him see that you had a gun?

1180
01:19:37,761 --> 01:19:39,461
[Jong Kook not letting go of Giraffe's gun
that he has inside his front pocket?]

1181

[Just then!]

1182
01:19:43,416 --> 01:19:47,280
[The one in front is a fake! Giraffe
had his real one hidden in the back!]

1183

[The chance to eliminate the Tiger
who's completely fallen for his ruse!]

1184

[Now is the chance!]

1185

Jong Kook is out!

1187
01:20:05,142 --> 01:20:07,618
This keeps spraying.
How do I stop this?

1188
01:20:08,236 --> 01:20:11,166
[Still haven't figured out
how to make it stop...]

1189

and is ousted!]

1190

<i>[Kim Jong Kook, out!
Kim Jong Kook, out!]</i>

1191
01:20:19,311 --> 01:20:21,991
I think it would be better
if we oust Ji Hyo right now.

1192
01:20:21,992 --> 01:20:24,165
Let's just finish her off right now.

1193
01:20:24,166 --> 01:20:26,874
- Ji Hyo, you don't have a water gun?
- No, I don't have one.

1194
01:20:26,875 --> 01:20:29,194
I told you that earlier.

1195
01:20:29,195 --> 01:20:32,067
I don't lie like you.

1196
01:20:32,068 --> 01:20:34,874
- I can't lie either.
- Don't lie. That's your specialty.

1197
01:20:34,875 --> 01:20:37,947
- Why are you lying to me about that?
- Say that to my face one more time.

1198
01:20:41,109 --> 01:20:43,584
You think I'm going to beg you
for that?

1199
01:20:43,585 --> 01:20:45,248
- Say it one more time.
- Go ahead and kill me.

1200
01:20:45,249 --> 01:20:47,946
If you shoot me like this now,
you really are a coward.

1201
01:20:47,947 --> 01:20:51,576
- You really are a coward.
- Ji Hyo, I shot you.

1202
01:20:53,166 --> 01:20:56,037
[Shameless Seung Gi?]

1203
01:20:56,038 --> 01:20:57,792
Seung Gi, you suit me very well.

1204
01:20:57,793 --> 01:21:00,160
[Red Team's shameless duo]

1205
01:21:00,161 --> 01:21:03,258
Fine... have a nice life, you two.

1206

[So far, Red Team is the only team
where all the members are left alive.]

1207
01:21:14,871 --> 01:21:17,764
- Two people... we got two people.
- Awesome. That's a great weapon.

1208
01:21:17,765 --> 01:21:19,988
- That's the best!
- I finally figured out how to use it.

1209
01:21:19,989 --> 01:21:23,115
[Now that we think about it,
Yoo-ames Bond has used this weapon before.]

1210
01:21:23,116 --> 01:21:27,067
See how this bends?
Then you can shoot someone like this to.

1211
01:21:27,068 --> 01:21:29,401
- Okay?
- Yes. What do you have? Does that work?

1212
01:21:29,402 --> 01:21:31,917
- Does it not work?
- No, it works.

1213
01:21:31,918 --> 01:21:34,368

[His nonstop bumbly charm]

1215

You know... I really do
realize how bumbly you are now.

1216
01:21:45,348 --> 01:21:46,769
Who is that?

1217
01:21:48,814 --> 01:21:50,637
That's just our staff member.

1218
01:21:50,638 --> 01:21:52,975
[It's our staff member...]

1219
01:21:52,976 --> 01:21:54,681
Wow, he's really fast.

[The fascinating world of Running Man...]

1221
01:21:58,727 --> 01:22:00,347
Wow... so fast.

1222
01:22:00,348 --> 01:22:03,624
Since we've all been running for two years,
even the staff members are pretty fast now.

1223
01:22:07,079 --> 01:22:09,031
If this plan succeeds...

1224
01:22:11,396 --> 01:22:13,226

is the only way to survive!]

[But anyway, where is
Yellow Team's sole survivor, Shin Hye?]

The way I see it, with number of people
ousted already, it's Suk Jin's time to go.

going to tell the Director everything.

How could you have died first?

1324
01:29:06,907 --> 01:29:11,271
[Shin Hye having kept the hope
of victory alive for her team.]

1325
01:29:11,272 --> 01:29:13,584
I've been hiding there for about
five minutes.

1326
01:29:13,585 --> 01:29:15,377
I didn't have a water gun.

1327
01:29:15,378 --> 01:29:17,362
- What the heck?
- What happened?

1328
01:29:18,047 --> 01:29:19,879
[Huh? Suk Jin and
Seung Gi walking in together?]

1329
01:29:19,879 --> 01:29:23,333
[Who won and who lost?]

1330
01:29:24,094 --> 01:29:29,213
[Agreeing to a duel since they're
both already exhausted.]

1331
01:29:29,214 --> 01:29:31,828
[The gullible kid...]

1332
01:29:32,261 --> 01:29:36,683
[Attack after the count of five!]

1333
01:29:36,684 --> 01:29:38,950
[Promising each other
to each take five steps!]

1334
01:29:38,951 --> 01:29:40,884
One!

1335
01:29:41,807 --> 01:29:48,760
[I'm a bit of a coward
while I'm playing games...]

1336
01:29:50,160 --> 01:29:52,486
[You, seriously!]

1337
01:29:52,487 --> 01:29:55,894
[He really is shameless Seung Gi!]

1338
01:29:55,895 --> 01:30:00,863
[With Agent Seung Gi's actions,
Red Team's scored a win!]

1339
01:30:00,864 --> 01:30:02,543
You did good! Great job!

1340
01:30:04,192 --> 01:30:07,276
[Huh? Something is being carried in?]

1341
01:30:11,365 --> 01:30:14,806
I bet this is something
for tomorrow's mission.

1342
01:30:16,957 --> 01:30:19,072
<i>Good work, everyone.</i>

1343
01:30:19,073 --> 01:30:21,341
<i>Good work, everyone.</i>

1344
01:30:21,342 --> 01:30:25,768
<i>To the first and second place team
of today's mission...</i>

1345
01:30:25,769 --> 01:30:33,859
<i>you will be given a pc and a smart phone
which will come in very handy tomorrow.</i>

1346
01:30:34,884 --> 01:30:38,667
<i>And unfortunately,
to the team that came in last today</i>

1347
01:30:38,668 --> 01:30:40,945
<i>you'll only be given a cell phone.</i>

1348
01:30:40,946 --> 01:30:45,739
<i>Don't despair, and I hope that
you'll work even harder tomorrow.</i>

1349
01:30:46,421 --> 01:30:50,128
Then each team member take a case
that's been brought in front of you.

1350
01:30:50,720 --> 01:30:52,728
You're all dismissed.

1351
01:30:55,516 --> 01:30:58,509
[Each team taking cases with the
order of winning written on the case.]

1352
01:31:00,068 --> 01:31:03,945
[How are we supposed to use
these tomorrow?]

1353
01:31:03,946 --> 01:31:06,326
It's something Jae Suk can't even use
even though he has it in hand.

1354
01:31:07,126 --> 01:31:08,756
What do I use this for?

1355
01:31:08,757 --> 01:31:10,953
That's a relief. Because I
don't know how to use it either.

1356
01:31:10,954 --> 01:31:12,967
What do we use this for?

1357
01:31:12,968 --> 01:31:16,905
[Anyways, the agents who've been
given supplies by M...]

1358
01:31:16,905 --> 01:31:23,900
[all went to each of their homes
in peace for the night...]

1359
01:31:23,901 --> 01:31:26,531
[The next day]

1360
01:31:26,532 --> 01:31:29,865
[In front of Agent Jae Suk's home.]

1361
01:31:32,561 --> 01:31:34,055
What brings you here?

1362
01:31:34,056 --> 01:31:35,991
[Heading out for the day with the
case he's been given in hand...]

1363
01:31:38,621 --> 01:31:39,894
Hello?

1364
01:31:39,895 --> 01:31:43,905
[A phone call they all receive
from Director M...]

1365
01:31:44,911 --> 01:31:47,997
<i>[You've all been issued a
license to oust...]</i>

1367
01:31:51,276 --> 01:31:54,700
[Running Man Secret Agents, your
real intelligence operation starts now!]

1368
01:31:54,701 --> 01:31:57,598
<i>I've been given a tip that the gold
inside the prism vault will be detonated.</i>

1369
01:31:57,599 --> 01:31:59,729
<i>I heard that he's still alive!</i>

<i>[Their enemy -
Spine tingling being of darkness!]</i>

1372
01:32:09,256 --> 01:32:11,431
<i>You have to be honest with me.</i>

1373
01:32:11,432 --> 01:32:13,926
[No one can be trusted! Division
and confusion amongst the team!]

1374
01:32:13,927 --> 01:32:16,409
<i>007... I'm putting my trust in you.</i>
