172
00:15:14,849 --> 00:15:17,037
I'm sorry, but I'm older!

173
00:15:17,038 --> 00:15:18,603
Suk Jin is getting down on his knees!

174
00:15:19,204 --> 00:15:21,105
- You're older than him?
- Yes.

175
00:15:22,078 --> 00:15:24,561
Then are the seven of them a team,
and the rest of us are one team?

176
00:15:24,562 --> 00:15:28,451
<i>That's why we have invited one person
who will be joining your team.</i>

177
00:15:28,452 --> 00:15:30,311
- You have?
- There's another person?

178
00:15:30,312 --> 00:15:31,862
Why are there so many guests?

179
00:15:33,179 --> 00:15:35,542
[This music is?]

180
00:15:36,235 --> 00:15:38,879
[What? Is this a red ostrich?]

181
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,524
[Goo Hara of KARA.]

182
00:15:42,471 --> 00:15:45,675
[Mister - 2010. KARA]

183
00:15:47,468 --> 00:15:49,046
- It's KARA!
- KARA!

184
00:15:53,262 --> 00:15:56,780
[Hara will be joining the
Running Man Team.]

185
00:15:56,781 --> 00:15:58,974
Seriously, we like her better than
Jong Kook!

186
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:01,349
- Well, seriously...
- What?

187
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:04,677
Since we're here too,
why don't we mix up our team?

188
00:16:05,623 --> 00:16:08,020
- You want us to leave?
- Why don't we switch up a member?

189
00:16:10,556 --> 00:16:13,091
Is this how the teams are going
to be set up?

190
00:16:13,755 --> 00:16:15,742
<i>Your mission today...</i>

191
00:16:15,743 --> 00:16:19,945
<i>is the time machine marble race.</i>

192
00:16:19,946 --> 00:16:22,566
[Today's mission,
Time machine marble race.]

193
00:16:22,567 --> 00:16:26,965
<i>Team Running Man and Team 8090 will
be taking the time machine</i>

194
00:16:26,966 --> 00:16:28,726
<i>to take a trip to the past.</i>

195
00:16:28,727 --> 00:16:30,299
You really are coming up with
a variety of things for us to do.

196
00:16:30,337 --> 00:16:34,701
[Now we even have to travel
through time.]

197
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:39,532
<i>You will take a trip to each of your time in
the past, and will have to win the marble.</i>

198
00:16:40,231 --> 00:16:43,347
<i>You will have a marble competition with
the marbles you have gained</i>

199
00:16:43,348 --> 00:16:45,493
<i>at the final location and the team
that wins will be the final winners.</i>

200
00:16:46,136 --> 00:16:51,217
<i>Everyone change into your team outfits first,
and your time machines await you outside.</i>

201
00:16:51,728 --> 00:16:55,568
- Sir, you have to change your outfits.
- Is this what Running Man is about now?

202
00:16:55,569 --> 00:16:57,348
Hey! We're not 'Sirs' here!

203
00:16:57,349 --> 00:16:59,156
We're all just
older brothers and sisters here!

204
00:17:00,826 --> 00:17:03,018
- How should we address you then?
- Just call us by our names.

205
00:17:04,744 --> 00:17:07,232
- Older brothers and sisters.
- Not sirs?

206
00:17:07,233 --> 00:17:08,914
[The legend singers wanting to be
addressed casually.]

207
00:17:08,915 --> 00:17:11,628
I think these older sisters...
both have a bit of an attitude.

208
00:17:11,629 --> 00:17:16,481
[Anticipate today's events...
original beauties with attitudes.]

209
00:17:16,482 --> 00:17:17,551
We have to be careful.
I know them and they have attitudes.

210
00:17:17,552 --> 00:17:21,472
<i>Please change into your team clothing and
gather outside in front of your time machines.</i>

211
00:17:21,473 --> 00:17:23,182
[Off they go to the time machines!]

212
00:17:25,025 --> 00:17:26,371
Nice to see you!

213
00:17:28,598 --> 00:17:34,650
[Time machine awaits you!]

214
00:17:36,432 --> 00:17:38,428
Okay, everyone... let's all gather out front.

215
00:17:38,429 --> 00:17:40,164
Is this what we're riding?

216
00:17:40,165 --> 00:17:43,050
Wow... it's a time machine!

217
00:17:52,544 --> 00:17:57,253
[Now, back to the past...]

218
00:17:58,416 --> 00:18:02,335
[And they're off!]

219
00:18:02,336 --> 00:18:04,305
[Back to the 8090's.]

220
00:18:05,286 --> 00:18:08,337
Everyone... are you
all ready to go back to the past?

221
00:18:08,338 --> 00:18:10,579
- Yes, we are!
- What year are we going back to?

222
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:13,247
- I'm nervous!
- Are we going back to the 80's or the 90's?

223
00:18:13,248 --> 00:18:15,671
We're going back to 1982!

224
00:18:15,672 --> 00:18:18,122
Jae Suk, then Hara wouldn't even
have been born yet.

225
00:18:18,123 --> 00:18:19,842
Hara, what year were you born in?

226
00:18:19,843 --> 00:18:21,997
- In 1991.
- So it's before you were born?

227
00:18:21,998 --> 00:18:24,885
Hara, do you want to go to 1982?

228
00:18:24,886 --> 00:18:26,082
Yes!

229
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:27,753
I bet the gravitational pull
is going to be mighty.

230
00:18:32,773 --> 00:18:35,929
[The power of the gravitation pull!]

231
00:18:38,473 --> 00:18:42,088
[Let's go back to the past!]

232
00:18:47,478 --> 00:18:51,167
[Heading back to 1982!]

233
00:18:54,652 --> 00:18:56,645
[Heading back to the past.]

234
00:18:57,292 --> 00:18:59,780
[Wan Kwan disappointed at having lost
Hara to the other team.]

235
00:18:59,781 --> 00:19:01,467
Let's just switch then.
I like the other team better too.

236
00:19:02,424 --> 00:19:07,502
- Who is it that you like on the other team?
- Kwang Soo seems so nice and sweet.

237
00:19:07,503 --> 00:19:10,386
He may be nice and sweet,
but we're much better looking than him.

238
00:19:11,128 --> 00:19:13,243
We're all singers on this team
with looks to show for it.

239
00:19:13,244 --> 00:19:15,101
- Of course!
- We're all better looking.

240
00:19:15,102 --> 00:19:16,191
- Jong Kook...
- Yes?

241
00:19:16,192 --> 00:19:18,524
- I think you got lucky coming to our team.
- Why do you say that?

242
00:19:18,525 --> 00:19:21,232
The reason being is that the other team
can't be too brash towards us.

243
00:19:21,233 --> 00:19:24,211
[About to utilize the advantage of the
other team not being able to act brash?]

244
00:19:24,212 --> 00:19:28,244
Back in the day, I couldn't even breathe
when I was in the same dressing room with you.

245
00:19:28,245 --> 00:19:30,080
I found you scarier.

246
00:19:30,081 --> 00:19:32,478
[Ah... I see...]

247
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:40,129
[Believe...]

248
00:19:43,204 --> 00:19:46,893
[Arriving in 1982!]

249
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:49,797
- We're in 1982?
- Of course! Believe in it.

250
00:19:52,299 --> 00:19:55,082
To truly be back in 1982,
you have to walk like this.

251
00:19:55,828 --> 00:19:57,454
It's Myungrang Field!

252
00:20:01,964 --> 00:20:06,308
[Myungrang Field]

253
00:20:07,865 --> 00:20:11,765
[1982- The program that used to start off
Sunday mornings back in that year.]

255
00:20:19,448 --> 00:20:21,101
Wow! It's 1982!

256
00:20:21,102 --> 00:20:24,419
- Are we really back in 1982?
- Hara, this is 1982.

257
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:27,493
- This is 1982?
- This is Myungrang Field.

258
00:20:27,849 --> 00:20:30,665
Myungrang Field!
[Show host: Kim Hwan]

259
00:20:32,541 --> 00:20:35,995
[Huh? That song is
National Singing show's tune?]

260
00:20:35,996 --> 00:20:38,332
- What are you doing here?
- Hey, it's Byun Woong Jeon!

261
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:41,508
Hwan, are you supposed to be
Byun Woong Jeon?

262
00:20:42,271 --> 00:20:43,678
Iron stamina and a wise mind...

263
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:46,255
The time at Myungrang Field
has made its return.

264
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:52,377
The game we will be playing is the
best known game here at Myungrang Field.

265
00:20:52,378 --> 00:20:54,717
It's an obstacle relay race.

266
00:20:54,718 --> 00:20:56,886
That was what they did at the very end.

267
00:20:57,295 --> 00:21:00,728
[The game that used to be played at the
end of each show at Myungrang Field.]

268
00:21:00,729 --> 00:21:02,818
You have to wear the big person suit

269
00:21:02,819 --> 00:21:05,563
and as you all can see,
there are four obstacles in front of you.

270
00:21:05,564 --> 00:21:07,189
Your first obstacle is the downhill obstacle.

271
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:10,223
Second course is the
water puddle jump post.

272
00:21:10,224 --> 00:21:13,246
Third course is the
rubber pass through obstacle.

273
00:21:13,247 --> 00:21:15,660
And finally,
you have the cookie eating obstacle.

274
00:21:15,661 --> 00:21:17,462
Just leave it to us,
we're confident we can win this.

275
00:21:17,463 --> 00:21:19,550
- You've done this a lot, right?
- Of course, I have.

276
00:21:19,551 --> 00:21:21,647
- Leave it to us.
- Jong Kook, give us some tips.

277
00:21:21,648 --> 00:21:23,244
I'm sure there's one of here
who may be a bit too old for all this.

278
00:21:25,764 --> 00:21:29,391
What we need here since we're not
able to compete with them physically...

279
00:21:29,392 --> 00:21:31,209
We're going to have to cheat.

girlfriend from the back.

284
00:21:45,129 --> 00:21:49,991
Why are you overreacting?
I'm okay with it. I like it.

285
00:21:49,992 --> 00:21:51,132
It's so weird.

286
00:21:51,133 --> 00:21:53,561
- Hara... go rip off his name tag.
- Okay.

287
00:21:56,699 --> 00:21:57,858

- Wan Sun, what's wrong?
- That's cheating!

- That's not right.
- Stop it, all of you!

[Acting as if he's really been ousted...]

[Praising the validity of dating
older women.]

You can step over me to get to
the other side.

341
00:25:02,744 --> 00:25:04,335
I won't have you getting wet too.

342
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:06,723
- You used to be my hero!
- Don't make me talk right now.

343
00:25:10,296 --> 00:25:12,342

- Jae Suk! I said, I have to talk to you!
- What?

364

the cookie for a while...]

[What is he doing...]

377
00:27:45,523 --> 00:27:47,664
Listen to his ragged breathing.

378
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:50,180
<i>I think he's praying that the cookie
will just fall into his mouth.</i>

379
00:27:50,181 --> 00:27:51,906
[Studying the cookie?]

380
00:27:53,737 --> 00:27:55,287
[Eh?]

from sheer exhaustion.]

391
00:28:22,645 --> 00:28:24,510

and an ambulance for him.</i>

392
00:28:26,262 --> 00:28:29,815
[Trying to work in unison
with the breeze.]

393
00:28:29,816 --> 00:28:31,756

Are you playing with me?

395
00:28:35,650 --> 00:28:37,510
- Are you playing with me!
- The cookie is teasing him.

396
00:28:42,788 --> 00:28:46,051

[Over 10 minutes of Won Kwan
breathing raggedly...]

400

when the wind keeps blowing it away?

401
00:29:01,074 --> 00:29:04,120
[Wait... the wind is momentarily...]

402
00:29:09,239 --> 00:29:12,407

- Won Kwon, you should've jumped!
- No, I can't jump.

418

Okay... we will now start the second round
of the obstacle course relay.

419
00:30:19,673 --> 00:30:22,782
For the second round,
it's going to be Song Ji Hyo and Gary.

420

[Sang Won not able to differentiate the
colors due to his sunglasses.]

445

Sang Won can't tell the color difference
because of his sunglasses right now.

446
00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:01,778
He just asked which one is
Kim Wan Sun.

[Wan Sun is over here...]

448

- What do I do?
- What do we about her?

449
00:32:11,899 --> 00:32:14,113
If you're going to roll, then roll sideways.

450

Hey... it's not easy, is it?

451
00:32:21,961 --> 00:32:24,420

[Wan Sun moving up the ramp to
the water puddle obstacle.]

461
00:33:08,059 --> 00:33:09,796
Get a little rest. Rest for a second.

462
00:33:10,850 --> 00:33:14,692
[Are you sleeping?]

463
00:33:17,968 --> 00:33:20,035
Do something!

464
00:33:21,246 --> 00:33:23,227
Do something!

into a sitting position.]

to get her balance back...]

470

Wan Sun, just dunk yourself.
Dunk yourself and pull yourself out.

471
00:34:07,497 --> 00:34:11,347
I'll give you a little break.
You can stand up to jump over the puddle.

- Help me stand up!
- Can I stand up too?

473
00:34:16,591 --> 00:34:20,121
- My legs... my legs.
- Her legs are about to give out.

474
00:34:20,122 --> 00:34:22,020

[Moving on ahead with his eyes
set straight on his path!]

[With the baton straight in front of him,
and walking upright.]

491

[Wan Sun with her aching legs
rushes over.]

504
00:37:00,577 --> 00:37:02,543
Because our Wan Sun
suffered through so much...

505
00:37:02,544 --> 00:37:04,013
So I had to make sure that I won.

506
00:37:06,583 --> 00:37:08,094
What the heck, Wan Sun?

507
00:37:08,095 --> 00:37:10,869
- I thought that you said your legs hurt?
- They do hurt. They hurt, but...

508
00:37:13,101 --> 00:37:15,279
[Thus the second round goes to
Team Legend!]

509
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,838
You almost had it.

510
00:37:18,818 --> 00:37:22,510
<i>It's one to one for the
obstacle course relay.</i>

511
00:37:22,511 --> 00:37:25,789
<i>And for the third course,
it'll be three on three.</i>

512
00:37:25,790 --> 00:37:27,270
- Three participants?
- Yes.

513
00:37:27,271 --> 00:37:29,778
Please decide the order of the players
and gather at the starting line.

514
00:37:30,167 --> 00:37:31,677
[First one up, Suk Jin and Sang Won.]

515
00:37:31,678 --> 00:37:33,624
I heard that you work out a lot.

516
00:37:33,625 --> 00:37:34,961
You kept saying over there that
you were confidant you could win.

517
00:37:36,419 --> 00:37:39,360
[Sang Won having felt frustrated over
other people struggling with the game.]

518
00:37:39,361 --> 00:37:41,785
I don't get why they can't do this.

519
00:37:43,054 --> 00:37:44,345
It's easy.

520
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:49,639
[Highly anticipated first players.
Suk Jin vs. Sang Won.]

521
00:37:51,191 --> 00:37:54,220
[With his sunglasses and leather gloves...]

522
00:37:54,221 --> 00:37:56,524
The final obstacle relay.

523
00:37:59,787 --> 00:38:02,161
[The first generation of Idol starting off
confidently just as he spoke of.]

524
00:38:02,161 --> 00:38:03,645
[However...]

525
00:38:04,591 --> 00:38:07,423
[Exhausted right away...]

526
00:38:11,328 --> 00:38:14,287
[Depleted of energy not long
after starting out.]

527
00:38:20,198 --> 00:38:22,300
<i>It's because he didn't get any
exercise this morning.</i>

528
00:38:23,450 --> 00:38:25,153
I feel like my thighs are going to
start ripping to shreds.

529
00:38:26,889 --> 00:38:30,295
[The two seniors finally reach
the second obstacle.]

530
00:38:31,174 --> 00:38:34,365
- Sang Won, are you okay?
- Don't talk to me right now.

531
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:39,595
I went up to Sang Won and asked if he was
okay and he says to me, 'Don't talk to me...'.

532
00:38:39,596 --> 00:38:40,617
[His reply is, 'Don't talk to me'.]

533
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:46,437
[They still have the puddle left...]

534
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:52,144
Hurry! Use this moment to jump!

535
00:38:52,145 --> 00:38:54,012
Sang Won, hurry up and jump!

536
00:38:56,147 --> 00:38:57,270
Jump!

537
00:38:59,611 --> 00:39:02,210
Sang Won, Soo Ji just told you!
Jump!

538
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:08,094
[Oh?]

539
00:39:08,095 --> 00:39:11,420
[He's jumping?]

540
00:39:12,049 --> 00:39:15,004
[Succeeds in jumping with style!]

541
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,477

[Kerplunk]

545
00:39:30,498 --> 00:39:33,204
[Jumps right into the water.]

546
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:38,398
- Suk Jin, hurry! Hurry!
- Wait...

547
00:39:44,645 --> 00:39:46,863
[Huh?]

548
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:51,019
[Sang Won, who can't differentiate colors
passes his baton off to Hara?]

549
00:39:53,112 --> 00:39:54,880
[You have to give it to me!]

550
00:39:57,940 --> 00:40:00,013
[Round three's second player,
Soo Ji is off on her way!]

551
00:40:01,330 --> 00:40:03,015
Soo Ji, wait for me!

552
00:40:08,826 --> 00:40:11,597
[A much heavier costume.]

553
00:40:19,536 --> 00:40:21,074
It's really heavy!

554
00:40:24,352 --> 00:40:27,020
[Sang Won sprawled out in exhaustion.]

555
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,826
[Finally took off his sunglasses?]

556
00:40:35,978 --> 00:40:38,205
[Team Running Man barely gets
the baton handed off.]

557
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:43,392
[Soo Ji, not having passed through
the rubber rope obstacle yet.]

558
00:40:43,392 --> 00:40:45,203
It won't open up!

559
00:40:46,546 --> 00:40:48,077
You have to push your body through!

560
00:40:48,410 --> 00:40:50,602
[Hara, having caught up to her.]

561
00:40:50,603 --> 00:40:53,335
<i>You can't open it up for her!
You can't open it up for her!</i>

562
00:40:55,858 --> 00:40:58,350
[A much too difficult game for
the original Goddess of Innocence.]

563
00:41:03,926 --> 00:41:05,591
What do I do?

564
00:41:06,966 --> 00:41:09,214
[Total chaos at the rubber rope obstacle.]

565
00:41:15,514 --> 00:41:16,880
Soo Ji...

566

[What? You want to go together?]

568
00:41:27,558 --> 00:41:28,846
[When is she coming?]

569
00:41:35,907 --> 00:41:37,487
[Goodness... this is hard.]

570
00:41:40,036 --> 00:41:41,266
Soo Ji, jump!

571
00:41:44,084 --> 00:41:45,462
Nice!

572
00:41:45,463 --> 00:41:47,248
[Finally arrives at the fourth obstacle!]

573

[Succeeds by using a tool?]

578
00:42:10,003 --> 00:42:12,897
<i>Kwang Soo, sit down. You have
to be seated for the baton handoff.</i>

579
00:42:14,388 --> 00:42:17,648
- You have to tuck in your knees.
- They won't go in.

580
00:42:17,649 --> 00:42:20,528
Wait! They won't go in!

581
00:42:22,361 --> 00:42:24,831
[In the meantime,
Team Legend passes off their baton.]

582
00:42:25,368 --> 00:42:27,583
[Team Legend's final player,
Tae Hyung gets on his way.]

583
00:42:27,584 --> 00:42:29,568
- You have to tuck your knees in!
- They won't go inside the costume!

584
00:42:29,569 --> 00:42:32,064
- You can't do that!
- But they won't go in!

585
00:42:36,499 --> 00:42:39,138
[A sad Giraffe with the long legs...]

586
00:42:42,127 --> 00:42:43,834
I'm telling you,
my knees won't go in!

587
00:42:45,861 --> 00:42:48,176
[All his team members are trying to
help Kwang Soo tuck his knees in.]

588
00:42:49,002 --> 00:42:51,211
[Tae Hyung forging on all by his lonesome
to finish the race.]

589
00:42:54,391 --> 00:42:55,853
That hurts so bad!

590
00:42:57,876 --> 00:42:59,301
Just roll!

591
00:43:01,044 --> 00:43:02,365
One of his knees is still sticking out.

592
00:43:04,519 --> 00:43:05,815
<i>His knees are tucked in now.</i>

593
00:43:06,374 --> 00:43:08,916
[Finally getting both his knees
barely tucked inside the costume.]

for the first time.]

much progress.]

of energy?]

601
00:43:47,871 --> 00:43:51,305

- Losing the race would be absurd!

602

[The final obstacle, the water puddle.]

603
00:43:52,578 --> 00:43:54,991
- You have to jump over it.
- This is the end of it!

604
00:43:56,045 --> 00:43:57,401
Tae Hyung, get it done in one try.

605
00:43:57,553 --> 00:43:59,581
I don't have the strength to jump.

606
00:44:01,778 --> 00:44:03,963
[Compressed Giraffe's jump?]

607
00:44:11,980 --> 00:44:13,503

at submersion?]

Are you okay?

618
00:44:49,076 --> 00:44:51,249

Just one of you.

619
00:44:57,205 --> 00:44:58,751
[The victor has been pretty
much decided...]

so hard earlier.

[Victors advantage:
Able to choose three marble boxes!]

630

00:45:33,354 --> 00:45:36,321
He said to choose three boxes,
but five of you are standing up here.

632
00:45:36,322 --> 00:45:39,775
- Why are you doing that?
- We can choose them together!

633
00:45:39,776 --> 00:45:41,644
He said three of you can go up and choose,
but why were there five of you up here?

634
00:45:41,645 --> 00:45:43,396
That's how we used to do it
back in the '90s!

635
00:45:46,537 --> 00:45:48,051
I want this one.

636

remaining two.]

[Kkuk always gets the larger size
no matter what they are...]

the boxes.

about Sang Won?

[Sang Won having a difficult time...]

677
00:47:53,109 --> 00:47:56,815
[What awaits them in 1998?]

678
00:47:59,944 --> 00:48:02,313
Okay, come on.
We all have to go in together.

679
00:48:02,314 --> 00:48:04,493
['I've got a girlfriend'- Turbo.]

680
00:48:05,293 --> 00:48:07,527
[Arcade?]

681
00:48:08,750 --> 00:48:11,195
[All the popular games
from that time in one room.]

682
00:48:11,196 --> 00:48:14,818
- We're all up here.
- Soo Ji, you look so pretty!

683
00:48:14,819 --> 00:48:17,308
[All the pictures of Team Legend members
back in their hay day on the walls.]

684
00:48:17,309 --> 00:48:19,347
You really were very beautiful.

685
00:48:19,348 --> 00:48:22,181
I didn't even have much makeup on
back then either.

686
00:48:24,704 --> 00:48:26,847
- It's an arcade!
- It really is an arcade.

687
00:48:26,848 --> 00:48:29,013
- Tetris!
- Tetris.

688
00:48:29,014 --> 00:48:30,487
[Glad to see the games from their past.]

689
00:48:33,048 --> 00:48:36,139
[Jumping into the games right away.]

690
00:48:36,140 --> 00:48:37,969
[Working out his rage from
when he fell in the water.]

691
00:48:37,970 --> 00:48:43,319
<i>Everyone, please stop playing the games
and gather around.</i>

692
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:45,041
Just one hour.

693
00:48:47,717 --> 00:48:50,216
- What is this?
- Everyone listen to me and gather around!

694
00:48:50,217 --> 00:48:52,008
[Closing off their listening ears,
and fixing their gaze on the screens.]

695
00:48:52,910 --> 00:48:56,153
[Getting torn away from the arcade games
by the youngest Hara's tugging.]

696
00:48:56,154 --> 00:48:57,501
That's disappointing...

697
00:48:57,502 --> 00:48:59,483
<i>Little kid, Kim Jong Kook,
come on and gather up here.</i>

698
00:49:01,087 --> 00:49:03,276
Sang Won has finally taken off
his sunglasses.

699
00:49:03,277 --> 00:49:05,888
[Finally will be able to
differentiate the colors!]

700
00:49:05,889 --> 00:49:07,804
<i>In commemoration of having to come
1998 arcade room...</i>

701
00:49:08,263 --> 00:49:11,545
-The representative arcade game is...
- The punch!

702
00:49:11,546 --> 00:49:14,126
<i>We will determine who the winner is
by playing the punch game.</i>

703
00:49:17,807 --> 00:49:19,549
I thought Nam Jung was about
to fly away!

704
00:49:19,550 --> 00:49:22,003
- I really thought he was going to fly away!
- I thought a gust of wind blew through.

705
00:49:23,498 --> 00:49:26,750
[Flying fist that's as fast as the wind.]

706
00:49:27,425 --> 00:49:30,478
I can't even see your fist!
I can't even see it.

707
00:49:31,663 --> 00:49:35,490
[Four representatives per team.
One on one, all kill game.]

708
00:49:35,491 --> 00:49:37,741
- All kill?
- That's absurd!

709
00:49:37,742 --> 00:49:40,437
The other team has Jong Kook.

710
00:49:40,438 --> 00:49:43,022
Jong Kook is the one who just
put this new record high up here.

711
00:49:43,023 --> 00:49:44,914
Nam Jung is an all kill too.

712
00:49:44,915 --> 00:49:48,382
- Okay then, let's do this.
- I really couldn't even see your hand.

713
00:49:48,972 --> 00:49:50,101
Nam Jung is going to go first.

714
00:49:50,101 --> 00:49:52,706
[First player for Team Legend is,
Park Nam Jung.]

715
00:49:52,706 --> 00:49:54,547
[Team Running Man is Yoo Jae Suk]

716
00:49:55,622 --> 00:49:58,528
[Nam Jung to start off the game.]

717
00:49:58,528 --> 00:50:00,445
[A warm up?]

718
00:50:01,687 --> 00:50:04,678
[Loosening up his body
with a little moonwalk.]

719
00:50:07,402 --> 00:50:08,757
[Here I go!]

720
00:50:08,941 --> 00:50:11,147
You're really funny right now.

721
00:50:12,873 --> 00:50:14,239
Fighting!

722
00:50:19,185 --> 00:50:21,333
[A fierce punch!]

723
00:50:23,957 --> 00:50:25,773
[851 points!]

724
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:29,111
Jae Suk's no lightweight either.

725
00:50:30,409 --> 00:50:31,975
<i>Using two hands will definitely
get you more points.</i>

726
00:50:32,484 --> 00:50:34,681
I haven't really played this much...

727
00:50:35,459 --> 00:50:36,710
Challenge!

728
00:50:39,826 --> 00:50:42,453
[Jae Suk's punch]

729
00:50:42,454 --> 00:50:43,558
[Direct hit]

730
00:50:45,190 --> 00:50:46,439
[A pretty loud sound!]

731
00:50:59,724 --> 00:51:03,343
[Next up is Sang Won who's appearance is
enough to make others break out in laughter.]

732
00:51:04,571 --> 00:51:07,441
[Keeping his parka on.]

733
00:51:07,442 --> 00:51:09,807
Stop telling him what to do!
Don't tell him what to do!

734
00:51:09,808 --> 00:51:11,451
It's because he gets cold easily.

735
00:51:11,452 --> 00:51:12,907
Does he draw strength from it?

736
00:51:12,908 --> 00:51:16,721
[Sang Won's parka and leather gloves
which aren't ready to come off yet.]

737
00:51:16,722 --> 00:51:19,730
He barely just took off his sunglasses,
but he's refusing to take off the gloves.

738
00:51:20,557 --> 00:51:22,441
[100 points for his sense of individuality.]

739
00:51:22,442 --> 00:51:23,732
Challenge!

740
00:51:24,113 --> 00:51:26,783
[Jae Suk goes first]

741
00:51:26,784 --> 00:51:28,299
[A fierce sound!]

742
00:51:34,570 --> 00:51:36,833
[882 points!]

743
00:51:37,705 --> 00:51:40,261
- His points keep climbing up higher.
- That was really strong.

744
00:51:40,262 --> 00:51:42,016
[Wow, that's amazing.]

745
00:51:42,017 --> 00:51:44,238
- His points keep climbing higher.
- I've never played this game before.

746
00:51:45,501 --> 00:51:47,138
I've never played games like
this one before.

747
00:51:47,139 --> 00:51:49,708
[Bratty Jae Suk slyly trying to
break down his opponent.]

748
00:51:51,417 --> 00:51:53,127
He seems pretty confident right now.

749
00:51:53,128 --> 00:51:56,119
- Your stance has gotten weird.
- It wasn't Ddak-ji and punching!

750
00:51:56,120 --> 00:51:57,791
- Yeah, punching is it for me.
- Yeah, punching is the one for you.

751
00:51:57,792 --> 00:52:00,904
It's okay. I have faith you can do it.

752
00:52:00,905 --> 00:52:02,474
Why don't you rest for
about five minutes then?

753
00:52:02,475 --> 00:52:04,634
You have to cut off his energy.

754
00:52:05,177 --> 00:52:06,812
<i>Okay, challenge. Fighting.</i>

755
00:52:07,321 --> 00:52:09,123
[Leather glove clad Sang Won
taking the challenge.]

756
00:52:09,124 --> 00:52:10,480
- Fighting!
- Fighting!

757
00:52:14,546 --> 00:52:16,460
[Oh! Pretty fierce!]

758
00:52:16,706 --> 00:52:18,206
[Will he...]

759
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:32,846
- Challenge!
- Fighting!

760
00:52:32,847 --> 00:52:35,510
- Fighting!
- Punch out an all kill!

761
00:52:35,511 --> 00:52:36,846
You have an iron fist!

762
00:52:36,847 --> 00:52:40,006
- Nice, that's nice!
- Your fists are made out of metal!

763
00:52:40,007 --> 00:52:41,970
But your stance doesn't look very good.

764
00:52:41,971 --> 00:52:44,119
Nice, nice!

765
00:52:46,162 --> 00:52:49,290
[King of punches,
Jae Suk looking very relaxed.]

766
00:52:49,291 --> 00:52:51,970
- Don't keep practicing too much.
- Hurry up and do it! You're taking too long.

767
00:52:51,971 --> 00:52:53,675
That's right!

768
00:52:56,851 --> 00:53:00,148
I think his punches are just getting
stronger with each throw.

769
00:53:00,149 --> 00:53:02,047
[876 points]

770
00:53:06,227 --> 00:53:09,354
[Only two players left for Team Legend.
It is Won Kwan's turn.]

771
00:53:09,355 --> 00:53:12,161
- Finish it.
- You never know about Won Kwan.

772
00:53:12,162 --> 00:53:14,809
- Just look at his stance.
- I think he may be able to pull it off.

773
00:53:14,810 --> 00:53:15,733
Challenge.

774
00:53:15,734 --> 00:53:18,851
- Just watch him.
- Here it comes.

775
00:53:18,852 --> 00:53:20,689
Look at how big his build is.

776
00:53:23,753 --> 00:53:26,016
You really are huffing and
puffing a lot.

777
00:53:33,097 --> 00:53:35,118
[Won Kwan's punch]

778
00:53:35,119 --> 00:53:36,698
[Mighty powerful!]

779
00:53:36,699 --> 00:53:38,207
There it is!

780
00:53:41,747 --> 00:53:46,379
[Will he be able to beat Jae Suk's 876 points,
who's won two games in a row?]

781
00:53:50,783 --> 00:53:53,077
[Jung Won Kwan wins!]

782
00:54:00,855 --> 00:54:02,683
- Who's going to take the next turn?
- Kwang Soo.

783
00:54:02,684 --> 00:54:04,729
Let's fighting! Fighting!

784
00:54:05,710 --> 00:54:07,403
You have to rest in between.
Relax and rest.

785
00:54:07,404 --> 00:54:09,628
I never knew I'd get this nervous
over the punch game.

786
00:54:12,533 --> 00:54:15,244
[Previous winner,
Won Kwan takes the first turn.]

787
00:54:15,245 --> 00:54:18,127
[So strong!]

788
00:54:19,641 --> 00:54:25,226
[His score is... 882 points!]

789
00:54:29,709 --> 00:54:32,126
- You're like on Jong Kook's level.
- Kwang Soo, don't be nervous. Don't be.

790
00:54:32,654 --> 00:54:34,798
[Giraffe's turn]

791
00:54:34,799 --> 00:54:36,471
Show us what you used to be like
back in the day!

792
00:54:39,093 --> 00:54:40,806
Go back to the days
when you used to play around!

793
00:54:40,807 --> 00:54:44,016
[Transforming back to himself
when he used to play around?]

794
00:54:44,017 --> 00:54:46,859
- That's right!
- Kwang Soo...

795
00:54:48,497 --> 00:54:50,810
Think of this as Jong Kook's face.

796
00:54:53,824 --> 00:54:56,843
[If that's the Tiger...]

797
00:55:05,756 --> 00:55:07,167
I've been standing behind you.

798
00:55:07,168 --> 00:55:08,811
Kwang Soo, he's been behind you.

799
00:55:08,812 --> 00:55:11,459
- Just do it, just do it.
- Kwang Soo, you're looking good.

800
00:55:11,460 --> 00:55:13,457
- Kwang Soo, looking good.
- Just go and do it.

801
00:55:14,643 --> 00:55:19,845
[ I can see the Tiger's face!]

802
00:55:21,329 --> 00:55:23,082
[Take it!]

803
00:55:25,261 --> 00:55:28,167
[Not getting it quite right...]

804
00:55:28,532 --> 00:55:30,039
He didn't hit it right...
he didn't hit it right.

805
00:55:32,019 --> 00:55:33,597
[What?]

806
00:55:33,598 --> 00:55:36,654
[Kwang Soo wins...]

807
00:55:38,491 --> 00:55:41,689
[887 vs. 882. Wins by five points.]

808
00:55:42,871 --> 00:55:46,182
[But the Giraffe's rage
still hasn't gone away.]

809
00:55:47,131 --> 00:55:48,702
[Tiger, you!]

810
00:55:51,051 --> 00:55:52,618
Good job, good job!

811
00:55:52,619 --> 00:55:55,404
- That's absurd!
- You still have three people left?

812
00:55:56,020 --> 00:55:57,971
But the three people left are nothing
to be worried about...

813
00:55:58,797 --> 00:56:00,600
- Who do we have left still?
- We've got Jong Kook.

814
00:56:00,601 --> 00:56:04,010
[If the Team Legend's Jong Kook is beaten,
then it's an all kill!]

815
00:56:08,318 --> 00:56:12,816
[The power of the leather gloves?]

816
00:56:16,292 --> 00:56:19,428
[Once playful Giraffe takes his turn first.]

817
00:56:19,429 --> 00:56:22,380
- He picks on you all the time!
- He's always ripping off your name tag!

818
00:56:22,381 --> 00:56:24,118
He disrespects you!

819
00:56:24,528 --> 00:56:26,937
[Punch]

820
00:56:30,654 --> 00:56:33,027
[887 points!]

821
00:56:33,932 --> 00:56:36,614
If Jong Kook doesn't get 887 points,
then we win the game, right?

822
00:56:36,615 --> 00:56:38,656
I think the machine is broken.

823
00:56:38,657 --> 00:56:40,885
- I never knew he was that strong.
- Fighting!

824
00:56:40,886 --> 00:56:42,089
Challenge.

825
00:56:42,649 --> 00:56:44,920
- Kim Jong Kook, fighting!
- Jong Kook, don't break the machine.

826
00:56:46,550 --> 00:56:49,429
[Team Legend's hope,
their youngest teammate, Kkuk!]

827
00:56:53,828 --> 00:56:55,870
[A powerful punch!]

828
00:56:56,512 --> 00:56:58,219
[What will his score come out to be?]

829
00:57:08,820 --> 00:57:11,966
[889 points vs. 887 points.
Jong Kook wins by two points!]

830
00:57:12,590 --> 00:57:14,127
[Bitter remaining players]

831
00:57:19,622 --> 00:57:21,220
775!

832
00:57:23,868 --> 00:57:25,683
Me, I'll do it.

833
00:57:25,684 --> 00:57:27,461
[Team Running Man, Ha Ha up to bat.]

834
00:57:27,462 --> 00:57:29,036
Okay, here I go.

835
00:57:29,037 --> 00:57:30,608
I'm scared. Let's get out of his way.

836
00:57:30,609 --> 00:57:32,360
- Fighting!
- Fighting!

837
00:57:32,361 --> 00:57:33,533
Fighting!

838
00:57:33,534 --> 00:57:34,788
I'm scared.

839
00:57:36,005 --> 00:57:37,653
[A powerful punch]

840
00:57:40,735 --> 00:57:43,631
[893 points!]

841
00:57:49,110 --> 00:57:51,857
- Why are you getting so angry?
- When did I get angry?

842
00:57:52,417 --> 00:57:54,527
[Will Kkuk win the game like this?]

843
00:57:54,528 --> 00:57:57,185
Ha Ha, you can do it!

844
00:57:59,975 --> 00:58:02,378
[I can do this...]

845
00:58:04,552 --> 00:58:06,325
Don't make that face though.

846
00:58:13,807 --> 00:58:15,745
Your wife is watching.
Think of your wife watching the show.

847
00:58:15,746 --> 00:58:17,867
- Ha Ha...
- Challenge!

848
00:58:21,857 --> 00:58:24,014
[A powerful sound?]

849
00:58:24,990 --> 00:58:26,701
[Just what...]

850
00:58:36,450 --> 00:58:38,346
[As predicted, Jong Kook's win.]

851
00:58:40,903 --> 00:58:43,370
- That's so disappointing.
- I threw it as hard as I could.

852
00:58:43,371 --> 00:58:45,638
[Now even Ha Ha's been eliminated...
Only one left for Team Running Man.]

853
00:58:45,639 --> 00:58:49,220
- Gary, good luck.
- Gary's really strong too.

854
00:58:49,220 --> 00:58:53,477
- Let's boo him, boo!
- Kim Jong Kook, fighting!

855
00:58:54,137 --> 00:58:56,585
[Will it be Kkuk's all kill...]

856
00:59:01,694 --> 00:59:04,743
[The last punch]

857
00:59:04,744 --> 00:59:06,256
[Using his elbow this time!]

858
00:59:08,024 --> 00:59:10,315
[886 points!]

859
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:13,115
- We're in big trouble.
- 886. You can do this.

860
00:59:13,116 --> 00:59:14,938
- Gary, you can do this!
- Gary, he only got 886 points.

861
00:59:16,060 --> 00:59:21,117
Think about all the things I've been through.
This is nothing compared to that.

862
00:59:21,117 --> 00:59:22,465
Gary, boo!

863
00:59:28,229 --> 00:59:30,470
- You can't do that!
- Don't pay any attention to them.

864
00:59:30,471 --> 00:59:33,557
- Pretend they're not even here!
- Stop bothering me!

865
00:59:35,286 --> 00:59:37,625
- No, no...
- Gary...

866
00:59:37,626 --> 00:59:40,223
Why do you keep calling my name?

867
00:59:40,224 --> 00:59:42,305
Why do you keep calling my name?

868
00:59:42,306 --> 00:59:44,246
So that you'll do a bad job.

869
00:59:45,195 --> 00:59:48,558
[The mental attack by Soo Ji.]

870
00:59:48,559 --> 00:59:51,177
She's saying all sorts of things to him.

871
00:59:51,884 --> 00:59:54,399
- Let's go! Let's go!
- You can't do it.

872
00:59:57,738 --> 01:00:01,032
[Hanging his life on his one punch?]

873
01:00:02,068 --> 01:00:04,389
[The sound was mighty powerful...]

874
01:00:04,869 --> 01:00:07,186
[Just what will the results say?]

875
01:00:17,466 --> 01:00:19,626
[Gary wins!]

876
01:00:22,118 --> 01:00:25,438
[The power of Gary's one punch with
his life hanging from it!]

877
01:00:25,439 --> 01:00:27,147
That's so disappointing...

878
01:00:27,148 --> 01:00:29,258
[I'm so angry...]

879
01:00:31,131 --> 01:00:33,782
[Punch all kill, Team Running Man wins!]

880
01:00:33,783 --> 01:00:35,380
We won because Jong Kook
made a mistake.

881
01:00:37,346 --> 01:00:41,482
[Now heading into year 2000 after
each team gets their marbles.]

882
01:00:48,308 --> 01:00:51,794
- Everyone, off.
- We're in year 2002.

883
01:00:52,778 --> 01:00:57,218
[What mission awaits them
in year 2002?]

884
01:00:59,613 --> 01:01:02,249
- What is this place?
- This is a karaoke bar.

885
01:01:02,250 --> 01:01:04,825
We really used to come here a lot.

886
01:01:05,763 --> 01:01:09,002
[A place they're glad to see again.]

887
01:01:09,934 --> 01:01:14,728
<i>A variety show of this kind was
very popular back in the 2000's.</i>

888
01:01:14,729 --> 01:01:17,201
Yes, you're right.

889
01:01:17,202 --> 01:01:23,089
<i>And the game that got the most love
out of them all was none other than...</i>

890
01:01:23,090 --> 01:01:25,314
<i>Tray karaoke bar.</i>

891
01:01:25,315 --> 01:01:30,967
- We all used to watch it on TV.
- Why are you mentioning that?

892
01:01:30,968 --> 01:01:34,759
<i>And the writer that used to do
all the cues is still here.</i>

893
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:37,934
And I see that camera PD is
still here too!

894
01:01:37,935 --> 01:01:41,436
- And the main writer...
- Yes, he is still here too.

895
01:01:41,437 --> 01:01:46,238
<i>Since this is the last game before we go to
the final location, five marbles are at stake.</i>

896
01:01:47,210 --> 01:01:49,567
<i>And the losing team only gets
two marbles.</i>

897
01:01:50,936 --> 01:01:53,498
[Team Running Man is first
to take their turn.]

898
01:01:53,499 --> 01:01:55,960
- It can't be anything too easy.
- I'm not going to pick anything.

899
01:01:56,736 --> 01:01:59,979
[Will be Team Running Man's song
for tray karaoke?]

900
01:02:02,825 --> 01:02:10,275
[Team Running Man's song:
On the phone by Firetruck.]

901
01:02:39,616 --> 01:02:41,693
The lyrics are way too easy.

902
01:02:55,462 --> 01:02:58,404
Okay, it said, always on the phone...

903
01:03:05,545 --> 01:03:07,378
Jae Suk knows it all...
he knows all the lyrics.

904
01:03:35,030 --> 01:03:38,095
- I think I can get all the lyrics.
- I think you've made it way too easy.

905
01:03:38,096 --> 01:03:39,846
The lyrics can be heard way too easily.

906
01:03:39,847 --> 01:03:43,996
- No, we can't hear it too well here.
- But if you pay attention, you can hear it.

907
01:03:44,700 --> 01:03:47,044
But our pronunciation
of the words are better.

908
01:03:47,045 --> 01:03:49,422
[Self praises?]

909
01:03:49,423 --> 01:03:52,049
Our pronunciation of the English words
are totally natural.

910
01:03:53,125 --> 01:03:55,390
I think that is way too easy for them.

911
01:03:55,391 --> 01:03:57,792
I haven't played this in so long.

912
01:03:57,793 --> 01:03:59,886
Kwang Soo, that's not how you do it.

913
01:04:01,519 --> 01:04:04,619
[In front of the Master...]

914
01:04:04,620 --> 01:04:07,390
And you have to hold it like this
so that the numbers can't be seen.

915
01:04:09,347 --> 01:04:10,757
Pick one.

916
01:04:11,627 --> 01:04:13,254
- What number did you pick?
- Number one.

917
01:04:14,655 --> 01:04:16,707
- What number did you pick?
- Number three.

918
01:04:16,708 --> 01:04:17,791
I don't know the lyrics.

919
01:04:17,792 --> 01:04:21,451
And I picked number seven.
Let's all switch up our seats.

920
01:04:24,251 --> 01:04:27,263
- We can't talk things over now, right?
- No, you can't talk to each other.

921
01:04:27,264 --> 01:04:29,359
Ugh, I seriously don't know about this.

922
01:04:29,360 --> 01:04:33,076
<i>We're going to get the trays
put in place.</i>

923
01:04:33,725 --> 01:04:35,205
Try dropping it on us once.

924
01:04:40,869 --> 01:04:43,705
[People who have never been hit by it
before are shocked by the force.]

925
01:04:44,285 --> 01:04:46,584
It hurts more than they did
in the past.

926
01:04:49,113 --> 01:04:51,969
I have no idea how it goes.
Which part do I have? Who did four?

927
01:04:51,970 --> 01:04:53,395
You can't talk about it now.

928
01:04:53,396 --> 01:04:56,470
- You have to get hit before you can talk.
- We have to get hit first.

929
01:04:56,471 --> 01:04:59,767
- You have to sing it loud, okay?
- I only love you...

930
01:05:00,964 --> 01:05:04,133
[Team Running Man's first try]

931
01:05:04,134 --> 01:05:05,554
Please give us the music!

932
01:05:09,033 --> 01:05:10,918
What the heck?

933
01:05:11,903 --> 01:05:17,369
[Not having listened well before,
he misses the beat to go in.]

934
01:05:18,487 --> 01:05:20,218
- What are you doing, Suk Jin?
- What the heck?

935
01:05:20,219 --> 01:05:21,480
What the heck?

936
01:05:21,481 --> 01:05:24,946
[Off right from the get go.]

937
01:05:26,418 --> 01:05:28,783
You start on beat three, right?

938
01:05:29,737 --> 01:05:31,548
If you don't know,
there's nothing you can do about it.

939
01:05:31,952 --> 01:05:34,763
No, no... I didn't know either.
I didn't know either.

940
01:05:34,764 --> 01:05:36,622
The music is off, right?

941
01:05:36,623 --> 01:05:38,633
No, it's perfect.

942
01:05:39,215 --> 01:05:42,173
Tell him. Tell him how it goes.

943
01:05:42,174 --> 01:05:44,779
[Launching into lesson mode.]

944
01:05:44,780 --> 01:05:45,860
You have to match it to the beat.

945
01:05:45,861 --> 01:05:50,672
Even when we were recording the song,
it took us about 10 hours to get the beat.

946
01:05:51,313 --> 01:05:53,526
- That's actually really hard.
- Let us give it one more try.

947
01:05:53,527 --> 01:05:56,583
I'm telling you, it took us about 10 hours to
get the beat the first time around too.

948
01:05:57,870 --> 01:06:01,889
- Give us the music...
- Tae Hyung is trying to get it too.

949
01:06:02,658 --> 01:06:05,005
Jae Suk, it's really hard to get the beat.

950
01:06:05,006 --> 01:06:07,538
We had a really tough time with it too
when we were recording it.

951
01:06:08,214 --> 01:06:10,194
I think that's the third time
you've said that.

952
01:06:10,195 --> 01:06:12,898
You may have heard it three times,
but I've heard it six times sitting here.

953
01:06:14,613 --> 01:06:19,081
Hey, Jae Suk... I'm telling you.
It's really hard to get the beat.

954
01:06:19,082 --> 01:06:21,072
That's enough!

955
01:06:21,073 --> 01:06:22,696
[Team Running Man, second attempt.]

956
01:06:27,347 --> 01:06:30,044
[Misses the opening beat again!]

957
01:06:31,265 --> 01:06:33,102
How can you not get that?

958
01:06:35,281 --> 01:06:38,151
[The team is about to disband after
only two attempts at the song!]

959
01:06:39,275 --> 01:06:41,464
[Now they found out
that he's not very musical?]

960
01:06:42,837 --> 01:06:47,470
[It's not like they can use their chance
card they only have one of...]

961
01:06:51,011 --> 01:06:54,190
[After a team makes two attempts,
it's the other team's chance.]

962
01:06:54,191 --> 01:06:56,810
- Everyone ready?
- Please give us the song.

963
01:06:56,811 --> 01:06:58,710
[What will be Team Legend's song?]

964
01:06:58,711 --> 01:07:04,550
[Team Legend's song:
Pretty Girl by KARA.]

965
01:07:22,438 --> 01:07:23,693
I know this song.

966
01:07:28,068 --> 01:07:29,313
What is this?

967
01:07:29,314 --> 01:07:31,563
- This is...
- What is this?

968
01:07:33,021 --> 01:07:34,292
I don't think I can get this.

969
01:07:34,293 --> 01:07:35,794
So it's going back that way?

970
01:07:40,330 --> 01:07:42,371
No way... I don't know this at all.

971
01:07:44,129 --> 01:07:46,241
Hara may not know this part either.

972
01:07:46,242 --> 01:07:47,660
- Right?
- Yes.

973
01:07:48,590 --> 01:07:51,015
If it's not their own part...

974
01:08:06,704 --> 01:08:09,202
- Beautiful girl... that's what they're saying.
- Wait...

975
01:08:09,997 --> 01:08:11,595
I still don't get what they're saying.

976
01:08:11,596 --> 01:08:13,389
We lost.

977
01:08:14,044 --> 01:08:16,020
[After hearing the lyrics,
he's predicting they'll lose the game?]

978
01:08:16,021 --> 01:08:18,678
[Anyways, it's time to determine
the order of their seating.]

979
01:08:18,679 --> 01:08:21,720
- Do we decide by picking the spoons?
- Which number did you get?

980
01:08:21,721 --> 01:08:23,957
Everyone get up and find their seats.

981
01:08:25,657 --> 01:08:27,397
Why don't you try singing
the song first?

982
01:08:27,398 --> 01:08:31,146
[Singing the song first to make sure
they can get the melody right.]

983
01:08:36,356 --> 01:08:40,987
[Truly legends... Gets the
melody after hearing the song once.]

984
01:08:40,988 --> 01:08:44,918
- It's not about the pronunciation...
- Wait... who sings my part originally?

985
01:08:45,363 --> 01:08:46,935
It's not my part.

986
01:08:50,199 --> 01:08:52,656
[Advice from Hara,
the original singer of the song.]

987
01:08:52,657 --> 01:08:54,731
- Only one word so far has been wrong.
- Really?

988
01:08:54,732 --> 01:08:57,032
But my part of saying,
no, no, no was right?

989
01:08:57,033 --> 01:08:58,613
But isn't getting it wrong once okay?

990
01:08:58,614 --> 01:09:00,874
I'm just letting you know
about a mistake.

991
01:09:01,862 --> 01:09:05,605
[Team Legend's first attempt]

992
01:09:23,444 --> 01:09:26,206
[Tray drops at second verse.]

993
01:09:26,207 --> 01:09:28,767
[It's so funny to watch others getting hit.]

994
01:09:28,768 --> 01:09:32,084
<i>You got it right up to the part,
'Saying no is'...]</i>

995
01:09:32,085 --> 01:09:35,429
- What did you say?
- I said, 'Saying it's not okay'.

996
01:09:35,430 --> 01:09:38,514
- Isn't that right?
- You got parts of it right.

997
01:09:38,515 --> 01:09:41,090
Let's do it in a little bit.
My head hurts too much.

998
01:09:42,391 --> 01:09:46,643
[Team Legend members being hit for the first
time are flustered at the force of the hit.]

999
01:09:46,644 --> 01:09:50,092
Then 'Saying no to it' is wrong,
it's 'The word telling me it's wrong'?

1000
01:09:50,619 --> 01:09:52,822
Telling me that it's not okay?

1001
01:09:52,823 --> 01:09:55,421
- Your actions telling me that it's no?
- You be quiet.

1002
01:09:55,989 --> 01:09:57,890
What you're doing is not an
acceptable action.

1003
01:10:01,031 --> 01:10:03,547
[Could he possibly be searching
on the internet?]

1004

are you searching for the lyrics?</i>

1005
01:10:04,765 --> 01:10:06,241
I'm trying, but I can't find it.

1006

[Not able to search correctly,
since he doesn't know the song title.]

1007
01:10:12,940 --> 01:10:15,710
Your heart telling me it's not okay!
Your heart telling you no!

1008
01:10:15,711 --> 01:10:19,003
- It's not 'words telling me no'.
- The word telling me no?

1009
01:10:19,447 --> 01:10:21,600
It's not heart, but the word?

1010
01:10:21,601 --> 01:10:24,399
Then we'll go with what Wan Sun says,
and go with 'That word'.

1011
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:26,594
[Team Legend's second attempt.]

1012
01:10:27,529 --> 01:10:29,699
<i>Okay, this is your second attempt.</i>

1013
01:10:29,700 --> 01:10:31,013
This is our second attempt
at the challenge.

1014
01:10:31,014 --> 01:10:32,126
Challenge!

1015
01:10:43,025 --> 01:10:46,081
[The tray drops at the words, 'Word no'.]

1016
01:10:47,166 --> 01:10:49,662
Ugh... hurry up and pull this back up!

1017
01:10:50,851 --> 01:10:53,415
I can't believe we got hit again
at the same part.

1018
01:10:55,003 --> 01:11:00,731
[Team Legend fails at both attempts.
It's now Team Running Man's turn again.]

1019
01:11:02,013 --> 01:11:05,354
[Sang Won trying to get a hold of Hara,
and ask her what the correct word is.]

1020
01:11:05,355 --> 01:11:06,914
We have to finish this now.

1021
01:11:08,700 --> 01:11:13,675
[After a brief rest, they're
now confused about the lyrics.]

1022
01:11:14,048 --> 01:11:15,900
[English is so hard...]

1023
01:11:15,901 --> 01:11:18,595
[Team Running Man's third attempt]

1024
01:11:18,596 --> 01:11:19,833
We're doing it already?

1025
01:11:22,850 --> 01:11:26,001
[Again! Again!]

1026
01:11:27,442 --> 01:11:31,481
[It has been confirmed that Big-nosed Brother
has no musical bone in his body.]

1027
01:11:31,482 --> 01:11:34,327
This is really hard! I can't get the beat!

1028
01:11:35,165 --> 01:11:38,941
[It sounds as though as long as they can get
past the first verse, it'll be smooth sailing]

1029
01:11:39,184 --> 01:11:43,701
<i>I wanna hold you,
why do you need any more than that?</i>

1030
01:11:48,088 --> 01:11:49,746
What is, 'ba-baby, let's go'?

1031
01:11:52,253 --> 01:11:55,431
[Anyway, their biggest hurdle is to
get past the first verse.]

1032
01:11:55,431 --> 01:11:57,991
[Team Running Man's fourth attempt.]

1033
01:11:58,487 --> 01:12:00,850
- Okay, wait a beat?
- 'I love you...'

1034
01:12:10,703 --> 01:12:13,755
[Gary completely disregards the notes.]

1035
01:12:17,097 --> 01:12:19,482
[I know I did well...]

1036
01:12:19,483 --> 01:12:21,695
Did he get the lyrics wrong?
Or the notes wrong?

1037
01:12:21,696 --> 01:12:25,107
- He wasn't singing in tune.
- How can you do that?

1038
01:12:25,108 --> 01:12:27,623
- You can't do that!
- That's how I sing my songs!

1039
01:12:27,624 --> 01:12:29,651
It sounded like a completely
different song.

1040
01:12:29,652 --> 01:12:30,927
Soo Ji...

1041
01:12:30,928 --> 01:12:34,438
[Spouting off venomous words
in her elegant ways.]

1042
01:12:36,089 --> 01:12:39,776
Are you just trying to hog the camera?
Please don't take the camera away from us!

1043
01:12:39,777 --> 01:12:41,156
I don't care!

1044
01:12:41,157 --> 01:12:43,870
- You're really being...
- Let's switch spots.

1045
01:12:43,871 --> 01:12:47,033
[Team Running Man's two chances are up!
It's back to Team Legend!]

1046
01:12:47,034 --> 01:12:48,410
You know that you don't normally
count the tone of the songs.

1047
01:12:49,538 --> 01:12:51,490
[This is nice...]

1048
01:12:52,892 --> 01:12:55,586
[A helmet?]

1049
01:12:55,587 --> 01:12:58,765
[Attempting to protect his head
from the force of the tray blows.]

1050
01:13:00,096 --> 01:13:02,311
[Feeling reassured.]

1051
01:13:02,312 --> 01:13:04,432
It doesn't hurt a bit.
It doesn't hurt one bit!

1052
01:13:04,433 --> 01:13:06,224
Can I have it?

1053
01:13:06,663 --> 01:13:08,982
Here, try it.

1054
01:13:15,796 --> 01:13:19,542
[This is 8090 slapstick comedy.]

1055
01:13:20,438 --> 01:13:22,990
[Team Legend's third attempt.]

1056
01:13:52,284 --> 01:13:54,747
- Why didn't you start singing?
- What are you doing?

1057
01:13:54,748 --> 01:13:56,619
[Tae Hyung being too relaxed
about it and...]

1058
01:13:58,126 --> 01:14:01,919
[He does remember the lyrics...]

1059
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:04,153
Hurry up and practice that 10 times.

1060
01:14:06,352 --> 01:14:08,963
[Practicing again now that they see
their opportunity to win.]

1061
01:14:08,964 --> 01:14:10,031
Ready, set, go!

1062
01:14:16,032 --> 01:14:19,648
[Continuing on right on cue.]

1063
01:14:21,430 --> 01:14:23,451
[No clue after that verse.]

1064
01:14:23,451 --> 01:14:25,293
Wan Sun, you don't know the lyrics?

1065
01:14:25,294 --> 01:14:27,599
- No, I don't know...
- Then want to take the chance card?

1066
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:29,241
Then want to take the chance card?

1067
01:14:29,242 --> 01:14:32,884
[Suggesting it so elegantly...]

1068
01:14:34,035 --> 01:14:38,614
[Not able to speak in a normal way.]

1069
01:14:41,230 --> 01:14:42,471
Too funny...

1070
01:14:42,472 --> 01:14:44,654
- Then let's use our chance.
- Why don't you go pick one?

1071
01:14:44,655 --> 01:14:48,451
[Team Legend uses their chance!]
I hope you get a dud!

1072
01:14:49,311 --> 01:14:52,802
[Just what is the chance that
she chooses?]

1073
01:14:53,350 --> 01:14:54,716
Our own original song!

1074
01:14:55,309 --> 01:14:57,289
[Original song]

1075
01:14:57,290 --> 01:15:01,321
[Have to listen very carefully now...]

1076
01:15:22,174 --> 01:15:23,924
I don't know...
I don't think I can get it.

1077
01:15:37,465 --> 01:15:40,329
Come on, beautiful girl. Okay...

1078
01:15:40,330 --> 01:15:43,449
[Sensible pose doesn't come easily...]

1079
01:15:43,450 --> 01:15:46,164
[Taking care of other people's parts too.]

1080
01:15:46,165 --> 01:15:48,922
[Team Legend's fourth attempt.]

1081
01:16:16,682 --> 01:16:18,266
Sang Won!

1082
01:16:19,039 --> 01:16:23,045
[He definitely said 'Walk very healthy'...]

1083
01:16:23,046 --> 01:16:27,027
<i>Wherever you are,
walk very healthy...</i>

1084
01:16:28,232 --> 01:16:31,155
Hara... I think Sang Won's lyrics
are better.

1085
01:16:32,423 --> 01:16:33,838
Don't you think it's better?

1086
01:16:33,839 --> 01:16:37,720
It's because I'm getting tired...
I'm getting tired.

1087
01:16:38,594 --> 01:16:44,247
[A healthy walk motto song.]

1088
01:16:46,882 --> 01:16:51,722
[Team Running Man's turn once again.
Determined to win this time.]

1089
01:16:53,140 --> 01:16:56,040
[What was my part again?]

1090
01:16:56,914 --> 01:16:59,120
Why does his expression look
so worried?

1091
01:17:00,362 --> 01:17:03,238
[Extremely worried from having
forgotten the lyrics.]

1092
01:17:03,374 --> 01:17:05,357
He looks like he's about to start crying.

1093
01:17:09,444 --> 01:17:10,925
Do you want me to do it
for you instead?

1094
01:17:12,966 --> 01:17:16,095
[Tone deaf and beat deaf combination.]

1095
01:17:18,114 --> 01:17:21,118
[Everyone working together
to teach one another.]

1096
01:17:26,128 --> 01:17:30,236
[Team Running Man's fifth attempt.]

1097
01:17:54,644 --> 01:17:57,694
[Giraffe ultimately missing the beat.]

1098
01:18:00,055 --> 01:18:01,571
Is it that hard?

1099
01:18:03,884 --> 01:18:06,020
[What do I do about him...]

1100
01:18:10,140 --> 01:18:13,986
[Have to include all the sounds they
hear in the chorus line.]

1101
01:18:13,986 --> 01:18:15,936
[There's a chorus?]

1102
01:18:17,040 --> 01:18:19,188
You know that line...

1103
01:18:19,189 --> 01:18:21,838
- The line is...
- Yeah, I get it.

1104
01:18:24,440 --> 01:18:28,053
We've never once had anyone else
take care of our chorus lines.

1105
01:18:28,054 --> 01:18:30,631
We did it all ourselves.
We even did all the girls' voices.

1106
01:18:30,632 --> 01:18:31,900
I'm being serious.

1107
01:18:31,901 --> 01:18:35,509
I think we need to use our chance.
I have no idea what the chorus is.

1108
01:18:35,510 --> 01:18:37,601
[In order to check the chorus,
they have to use their chance card.]

1109
01:18:38,316 --> 01:18:41,457
[They have to get either 'Hear a verse',
or 'hear the original song again'.]

1110
01:18:41,458 --> 01:18:43,482
- Replace the seats!
- What did you say?

1111
01:18:44,275 --> 01:18:46,853
Why would we change our seats now?

1112
01:18:48,139 --> 01:18:54,355
[When they've finally learned their parts,
they have to switch seats...]

1113
01:18:54,356 --> 01:18:56,751
[We're ruined...]

1114
01:18:56,752 --> 01:19:00,358
- But you still kept your seat.
- Why do I still have number one?

1115
01:19:00,359 --> 01:19:02,463
Please give us the music!

1116
01:19:31,389 --> 01:19:33,766
- I wanna hold you?
- It's 'I want you baby'...

1117
01:19:33,767 --> 01:19:36,761
You got it all right except for
the chorus.

1118
01:19:36,762 --> 01:19:40,380
<i>You got the main lyrics all correct.</i>

1119
01:19:40,381 --> 01:19:42,357
[The chorus is definitely the problem.]

1120
01:19:42,358 --> 01:19:43,961
- Let's end it now.
- Let's not drag it out anymore and end it.

1121
01:19:43,962 --> 01:19:47,763
[Team Legend with another chance
may be able to get it done this time.]

1122
01:19:53,138 --> 01:19:54,711
The thing we have to do...

1123
01:19:54,712 --> 01:19:58,019
Let's listen carefully to the person singing
in our own order and pick out the mistakes.

1124
01:19:58,020 --> 01:20:00,212
I'll just focus on Sang Won.

1125
01:20:01,430 --> 01:20:04,618
You don't know that Sang Won wakes up
as the night approaches, right?

1126
01:20:04,619 --> 01:20:07,357
[Sang Won coming to life at night?]

1127
01:20:07,358 --> 01:20:10,953
You guys are all over now.
He's all warmed up and ready to go now.

1128
01:20:10,954 --> 01:20:13,626
[If they do a night relay race,
Sang Won could win on his own?]

1129
01:20:13,626 --> 01:20:15,584
Put a cape on him right now.
I bet you he'll start flying.

1130
01:20:17,042 --> 01:20:19,919
[Sang Won, the night creature?]

1131
01:20:20,913 --> 01:20:23,511
[Team Legend's fifth attempt.]

1132
01:20:56,882 --> 01:20:58,628
What? What did I get wrong?

1133
01:20:58,629 --> 01:21:00,909
- Why?
- Wan Sun got it wrong?

1134
01:21:00,910 --> 01:21:04,292
<i>A sensible pose is just...</i>

1135
01:21:04,293 --> 01:21:09,376
[A sensible pose is okay?
A sensible pose is just done?]

1136
01:21:09,377 --> 01:21:11,032
Let's just get it done and go.

1137
01:21:14,928 --> 01:21:16,796
- I got it!
- What is it?

1138
01:21:17,768 --> 01:21:20,732
[Did Jae Suk figure out the chorus?]

1139
01:21:20,733 --> 01:21:23,287
- The line is busy...
- No, there's no 'the' in that.

1140
01:21:23,288 --> 01:21:25,544
The line is busy...
Isn't that what you said earlier?

1141
01:21:25,545 --> 01:21:28,033
You're right. I think you're right.

1142
01:21:28,487 --> 01:21:30,369
Let's make a trade.

1143
01:21:31,685 --> 01:21:33,258
Is it 'okay' or 'done'?

1144
01:21:33,259 --> 01:21:35,320
- What's the lyric?
- Don't tell him what it is!

1145
01:21:36,402 --> 01:21:37,652
You have to let us know first.

1146
01:21:37,653 --> 01:21:39,053
You have to tell us first.

1147
01:21:39,054 --> 01:21:40,946
- The line is busy.
- Really?

1148
01:21:40,947 --> 01:21:42,900
- I'm right? You said it earlier.
- Yeah, you're right.

1149
01:21:42,901 --> 01:21:47,287
- The line is busy... okay, your turn.
- Wait!

1150
01:21:47,288 --> 01:21:49,220
You just need to tell him whether
he got it right or not.

1151
01:21:49,221 --> 01:21:50,956
What the heck are you saying?

1152
01:21:53,908 --> 01:21:57,584
[Giraffe not wanting to reciprocate
after getting what they needed.]

1153
01:21:57,585 --> 01:22:00,599
- It's just not done...
- Ah, not done!

1154
01:22:00,600 --> 01:22:02,470
<i>It's not done, not done.</i>

1155
01:22:03,488 --> 01:22:05,369
<i>It's just not done.</i>

1156
01:22:06,688 --> 01:22:08,501
If you don't get it third time,
we're going to win it.

1157
01:22:08,502 --> 01:22:12,079
[Team Legend's sixth attempt.]

1158
01:22:12,080 --> 01:22:14,008
Let's go it. Let's finish it.
Let's go!

1159
01:22:16,441 --> 01:22:17,789
Let's be calm about it,
and not be too eager.

1160
01:22:35,302 --> 01:22:36,957
Why is he singing so softly?

1161
01:22:52,451 --> 01:22:55,072
- They might get it done this time.
- No, they can't...

1162
01:23:07,199 --> 01:23:10,575
[With the gentle voice... wrong!]

1163
01:23:12,208 --> 01:23:14,249
[What a lucky break!]

1164
01:23:14,250 --> 01:23:17,224
'While thinking about the day, I think
back to the words you say', isn't it?

1165
01:23:17,225 --> 01:23:21,204
- Why did we get it wrong?
- Why did we just get hit?

1166
01:23:21,205 --> 01:23:23,312
How much of it did we get right?

1167
01:23:24,187 --> 01:23:26,235
I thought Sang Won was
a female singer for a moment.

1168
01:23:26,236 --> 01:23:27,868
Why are you singing so softly
all of a sudden?
