- Two, four, six, eight...
- We have a guest?

00:01:03,057 --> 00:01:06,487

- Let's all lift up our glasses.

[Starting off with a toast.]

18
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:12,276

00:01:59,101 --> 00:02:01,142
- Here it comes, here it comes!
- It's headed this way!

32
00:02:01,143 --> 00:02:03,157

00:02:03,158 --> 00:02:06,013
[A full size limousine headed their way.]

34
00:02:06,014 --> 00:02:07,659
- It's coming this way!
- Who could be in there?

35
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:10,381
Whoever it is,
they're coming here on a train.

[A powerful entrance.]

37
00:02:17,802 --> 00:02:19,815

see who it is.

[Today's top guest is...]

39
00:02:35,749 --> 00:02:37,191
You startled me!

[The ultimate Hallyu Goddess,
Choi Ji Woo.]

41
00:02:42,318 --> 00:02:45,259

42
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:46,953
It's Choi Ji Woo!

43
00:02:47,885 --> 00:02:50,290
- Hello!
- You look so beautiful!

44
00:02:51,557 --> 00:02:54,665
[An actress truly befitting
of the red carpet.]

45
00:02:54,666 --> 00:02:57,023
Choi Ji Woo!
What are you doing here?

46
00:02:58,338 --> 00:03:00,290
- What brings you here?
- Wow...

47
00:03:00,291 --> 00:03:01,976
- I can't believe you're here!
- Hello.

48
00:03:01,977 --> 00:03:06,479
[Happily greeting everyone first.]

49
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,932
- Hello.
- I can't believe she's here!

50
00:03:08,932 --> 00:03:10,388
Look at how tall she is!

51
00:03:10,389 --> 00:03:12,677
- Are you naturally that tall?
- Yes.

52
00:03:14,889 --> 00:03:18,615
[So... tall.]

53
00:03:18,616 --> 00:03:20,728
I thought you were going up
to kiss her.

54
00:03:22,772 --> 00:03:27,114
I feel like we're at a
film festival with Choi Ji Woo here.

55
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:32,285
- Our guest is so beautiful!
- Our guest truly is beautiful.

56
00:03:32,286 --> 00:03:34,338
But isn't your back a little cold?

57
00:03:35,194 --> 00:03:37,951
- I'm a little concerned about your back.
- Can we help you with that at all?

58
00:03:38,965 --> 00:03:42,405
[Afraid of her back getting cold
with the low cut dress?]

59
00:03:42,406 --> 00:03:45,898
- What? Why are you guys yelling?
- Ji Hyo... just cover up Ji Hyo instead!

60
00:03:45,899 --> 00:03:48,571
- I was going to cover her up with this.
- No, it's okay. I'm fine.

61
00:03:50,112 --> 00:03:53,828
[Elegantly refusing with both hands.]

62
00:03:53,829 --> 00:03:56,717
This means, never.
She's adamantly refusing with both hands.

63
00:03:56,718 --> 00:03:59,157
- Do you not like us?
- No! No, it's not like that.

64
00:04:01,347 --> 00:04:03,997
<i>Today... with our
top rate Hallyu star, Choi Ji Woo...</i>

65
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:07,649
<i>and with the rest of our average rate
Hallyu stars, Running Man members...</i>

66
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:09,571
Come on, you didn't have to
put it that way.

67
00:04:10,547 --> 00:04:13,370
<i>With it being the end of the year...</i>

68
00:04:13,371 --> 00:04:18,645
<i>we're doing a special New Year's Eve show,
called 'The battle of the stars'.</i>

69
00:04:19,306 --> 00:04:25,469
<i>All eight of you will be going around together
and performing these missions individually.</i>

70
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:30,937
<i>And to the person that wins the round,
that individual will receive a star.</i>

71
00:04:31,301 --> 00:04:37,236
<i>And the first person to end up with all
seven stars at the final location</i>

72
00:04:37,236 --> 00:04:38,606
<i>will be the ultimate winner.</i>

73
00:04:41,833 --> 00:04:44,465
[However...]

74
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:49,098
[There's something suspicious about
the glint in Ji Woo's eyes.]

75
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:55,531
[An hour before
Running Man's New Year's Eve party.]

76
00:05:01,118 --> 00:05:03,880
[Oh? Ji Woo?]

77
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:07,492
[What is Ji Woo doing here?]

78
00:05:10,177 --> 00:05:12,784
- Welcome to Running Man.
- Hello.

79
00:05:13,268 --> 00:05:15,804
<i>By any chance, have you
ever watched Running Man before?</i>

80
00:05:15,804 --> 00:05:17,158
Yes, I'm a fan of the show.

81
00:05:17,159 --> 00:05:23,588
<i>We usually ask to meet in a setting like this
if there's a special mission to be given...</i>

82
00:05:23,589 --> 00:05:27,050
No! I don't like anything
special like that!

83
00:05:27,051 --> 00:05:29,564
I just...

84
00:05:32,891 --> 00:05:35,196
So this is what it feels like.

85
00:05:35,197 --> 00:05:37,114
Don't walk. Run.

86
00:05:39,786 --> 00:05:41,432
Guest's mission.

87
00:05:41,433 --> 00:05:43,067
One vs. seven...

88
00:05:43,068 --> 00:05:44,646
[One vs. Seven?]

89
00:05:44,647 --> 00:05:48,507
<i>[The battle against the Running Man.
You are a spy.]</i>

90
00:05:50,429 --> 00:05:53,576
<i>[And one of the Running Man members
is the spy's partner.]</i>

91
00:05:53,576 --> 00:05:56,762
<i>[Find your partner and
oust all the other members.]</i>

92
00:05:56,763 --> 00:06:03,449
<i>[If you oust everyone without
getting caught to the end, the spy...]</i>

93
00:06:04,426 --> 00:06:05,757
One against seven?

94
00:06:05,758 --> 00:06:11,245
- And you have to oust everyone.
- How am I going to do that?

95
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:15,471
How am I going to oust Mr. Capable
and everyone else?

96
00:06:16,808 --> 00:06:20,397
<i>If you somehow end up getting caught
for being the spy...</i>

97
00:06:20,397 --> 00:06:22,836
- Then the show's going to stop recording?
- Yes, then this show will stop recording.

98
00:06:23,906 --> 00:06:25,791
- Then this show ends immediately?
- Yes, it'll end immediately.

99
00:06:25,792 --> 00:06:29,201
It's going to end right away
when I came all the way here?

100
00:06:30,049 --> 00:06:34,138
[And that's her secret mission which was
handed to her before the show started.]

101
00:06:37,704 --> 00:06:40,280
<i>A grand prize is waiting for the winner
with it being the end of the year.</i>

102
00:06:40,281 --> 00:06:41,409
We understand.

103
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:44,599
<i>You are all going to get on Busan's city
tour bus to move to your next location.</i>

104
00:06:44,599 --> 00:06:46,004
- Wow!
- The tour bus?

105
00:06:46,005 --> 00:06:48,757
<i>Please change your clothes,
and gather in front of the bus.</i>

106
00:06:51,024 --> 00:06:53,956
Wow... we're going to do the show with
Choi Ji Woo today!

107
00:06:53,957 --> 00:06:57,233
Ji Woo's been on variety show's before,
so you can see how she knows to fist pump.

108
00:06:57,234 --> 00:06:59,711
- Look at her fist pump.
- Why don't you say something?

109
00:06:59,712 --> 00:07:01,263
Choi Ji Woo, why don't
you show us how it's done again?

110
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:05,343
[Her reaction that they'd all
like to see one more time.]

111
00:07:05,344 --> 00:07:07,335
Come on, Ji Woo.
Why don't you do it again?

112
00:07:07,336 --> 00:07:09,112
- Let's go!
- Yeah!

113
00:07:09,574 --> 00:07:11,365
- Let's go!
- Yeah!

114
00:07:13,989 --> 00:07:18,212
[Spy Ji Woo...
Will she accomplish her secret mission?]

115
00:07:20,118 --> 00:07:22,959
[However...]

116
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:29,964
[Earlier, when Ji Woo was
making her entrance...]

117
00:07:29,965 --> 00:07:33,738
- Is it an actress?
- If it's an actress, I bet she's top rate.

118
00:07:33,739 --> 00:07:36,144
- But all of us are here...
- Let's all commit to this.

119
00:07:37,755 --> 00:07:41,094
[Their conversation is a bit suspicious?]

120
00:07:41,094 --> 00:07:44,040
[What? They already know?]

121
00:07:49,591 --> 00:07:55,438
[They were all... watching her?]

122
00:07:55,438 --> 00:08:00,527
[All the Running Man members were
watching and listening... in that case?]

123
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:05,589
The glint in her eyes right now...
she's totally committed to this.

124
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:08,898
- She's totally into this right now.
- You know that expression, don't you?

125
00:08:08,899 --> 00:08:13,661
The glint in her eyes right now...
she's totally into this right now.

126
00:08:13,661 --> 00:08:16,903
How am I going to oust Mr. Capable
and everyone else?

127
00:08:16,904 --> 00:08:18,427
She's asking how she's going to oust
Mr. Capable.

128
00:08:20,406 --> 00:08:24,239
This says that I have a partner.
Does it mean it's one of those seven?

129
00:08:25,664 --> 00:08:31,390
<i>As you've all just heard, her mission is to
find her partner to oust everyone else.</i>

130
00:08:32,008 --> 00:08:33,429
<i>As for the spy's partner...</i>

131
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:35,320
The way I see it, I think we
need to determine who that'll be.

132
00:08:35,321 --> 00:08:37,044
[It seems to be the wiser choice
to choose who that should be?]

133
00:08:37,044 --> 00:08:39,748
- How about Gary?
- Me?

134
00:08:40,298 --> 00:08:41,608
[Not such a good idea?]

135
00:08:41,609 --> 00:08:43,484
[Whenever he's given a special role,
his expressions always gives him away.]

136
00:08:43,484 --> 00:08:45,804
In my personal opinion, the ones Ji Woo
will feel most relieved about

137
00:08:45,805 --> 00:08:50,973
and feel reassured having as her partner while
being the spy would be the two of you.

138
00:08:50,974 --> 00:08:53,271
Either Ha Ha or Jong Kook.
One of those two would be best.

139
00:08:53,272 --> 00:08:58,096
- Ha Ha's usually good with the female guests.
- We're best at reassuring the female guests.

140
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:00,138
It's because you're always
scheming something.

141
00:09:00,139 --> 00:09:01,974
Okay then, leave it to me.

142
00:09:01,975 --> 00:09:03,664
[Female guest specialist?
Haroro chosen as the partner.]

143
00:09:04,342 --> 00:09:07,343
[Choi Ji Woo vs. Running Man.]

144
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:13,764
[Deceive one another.
Just who will be today's ultimate victor?]

145
00:09:13,765 --> 00:09:15,370
Is that it?

146
00:09:15,371 --> 00:09:18,895
[Today's mode of transportation,
City tour bus.]

147
00:09:18,896 --> 00:09:20,841
That's going to be freezing!

148
00:09:20,842 --> 00:09:23,045
[We're not going to be on the top level
in this weather, are we?]

149
00:09:23,046 --> 00:09:24,289
It's the middle of winter!

150
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:27,447
It's just a relief that Ji Woo isn't
going to be riding this in her dress.

151
00:09:27,448 --> 00:09:29,355
[Just a relief Ji Woo won't be riding
the bus in her dress?]

152
00:09:31,669 --> 00:09:33,661
- Hello.
- Hello.

153
00:09:34,057 --> 00:09:35,832
<i>Let's go!</i>

154
00:09:37,832 --> 00:09:40,295
[To the heart of Busan.]

155
00:09:41,188 --> 00:09:44,082
- It's totally freezing up here!
- It's so cold!

156
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:46,016
[Getting slapped in the face by
the frigid winter air.]

157
00:09:46,017 --> 00:09:47,697
The drama you did, 'Winter Sonata'...

158
00:09:47,698 --> 00:09:51,966
Didn't your character meet her love
for the first time on the bus?

159
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:53,629
- Yes, you're right.
- You did, right?

160
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:57,025
[The lead characters on 'Winter Sonata'
had their first meeting on the bus...]

161
00:09:58,075 --> 00:10:00,203
- That's right! We know all about it.
- We all remembered.

162
00:10:00,204 --> 00:10:02,359
And your face hasn't
changed a bit since then!

163
00:10:02,359 --> 00:10:04,438
[Really?]

164
00:10:05,555 --> 00:10:07,430
Is it okay for me to treat you
like my little sister?

165
00:10:08,411 --> 00:10:11,408
[Look at him acting like a fool...]

166
00:10:11,409 --> 00:10:13,406
He asks if he can treat her
like his little sister...

167
00:10:13,407 --> 00:10:16,364
- Let's just speak comfortably to each other!
- Yes, let's just do that.

168
00:10:16,365 --> 00:10:18,830
- You can lower your speech to me first.
- Okay, I will.

169
00:10:18,831 --> 00:10:20,409
- Really?
- Yeah, let's.

170
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,771
- Ji Woo!
- What is it?

171
00:10:26,007 --> 00:10:27,626
I got the ball rolling!

172
00:10:28,004 --> 00:10:30,251
I can't do it. I'm too big of a fan.

173
00:10:30,252 --> 00:10:32,292
Ji Woo... I can call you that, right?

174
00:10:32,839 --> 00:10:34,727
Yes, Suk Jin.

175
00:10:34,728 --> 00:10:39,355
Hey! You guys always just sit together
so naturally now, don't you?

176
00:10:39,356 --> 00:10:42,036
It's Monday today,
so what choice do we have?

177
00:10:42,036 --> 00:10:44,143
Then does Monday's mean that we're on?

178
00:10:44,741 --> 00:10:46,673
Should I be logging back in?

179
00:10:46,674 --> 00:10:50,931
[Monday Couple, we welcome you.
Please log in or out.]

180
00:10:52,196 --> 00:10:55,675
[Forgetting about the cold
in the midst of all their laughter.]

181
00:10:55,675 --> 00:10:57,429
[Arriving at the mission location.]

182
00:10:57,429 --> 00:10:58,560
There it is.

183
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:02,682
[No matter what happens,
this is where the first star will be given.]

184
00:11:02,683 --> 00:11:07,291
[Busan City Tour - Songdo Beach.]

185
00:11:07,292 --> 00:11:10,641
<i>- Everyone, off the bus!
- I don't want to get off!</i>

186
00:11:10,642 --> 00:11:12,587
Why are you asking us to get off?

187
00:11:17,012 --> 00:11:22,488
[The ultimate beach in Korea,
Busan Songdo Beach]

188
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,742
<i>Next year will be its' 100th year anniversary
since it opened to the public.</i>

189
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:32,673
<i>Okay, this will be the first game to
'The Battle of the Stars' mission.</i>

190
00:11:32,674 --> 00:11:34,505
<i>We have a three course relay
that we have prepared for you.</i>

191
00:11:34,506 --> 00:11:40,015
<i>You have to pass through the tire course
behind you and roll down the balance beams.</i>

192
00:11:40,016 --> 00:11:44,346
<i>And once you pass through the line,
you win the race.</i>

193
00:11:44,347 --> 00:11:47,740
<i>The race will be a one-on-one
tournament.</i>

194
00:11:47,741 --> 00:11:49,026
Choi Ji Woo looks so worried...

195
00:11:49,027 --> 00:11:52,071
[Somehow needs to win the race to get
the star... what to do...]

196
00:11:55,575 --> 00:11:58,037
- The Tiger against the Giraffe!
- Fighting!

197
00:11:58,038 --> 00:11:59,527
[First round, Jong Kook vs. Kwang Soo.]

198
00:11:59,774 --> 00:12:01,344
[In order for me to get the star...]

199
00:12:01,344 --> 00:12:04,837
[I need Mr. Capable to lose...]

200
00:12:06,216 --> 00:12:09,397
We're really going to have to win this
if we want the star, don't we?

201
00:12:09,398 --> 00:12:11,550
Coming in second would be the same
as coming in last.

202
00:12:11,551 --> 00:12:13,366
We need to get the star.

203
00:12:13,892 --> 00:12:16,385
[They need to make sure to behave
so that Ji Woo doesn't get suspicious.]

204
00:12:19,208 --> 00:12:21,036
[Huh? Why isn't he going through this one?]

205
00:12:27,479 --> 00:12:30,067
[The Giraffe is always asking for trouble.]

206
00:12:34,027 --> 00:12:36,935
[Using force to make him move over.]

207
00:12:36,935 --> 00:12:38,392
I don't want to go in there!

208
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:42,442
[With his monstrous strength,
he forces the Giraffe inside the tire tubes.]

209
00:12:44,249 --> 00:12:46,687
I can't believe he forced him in there.

210
00:13:00,132 --> 00:13:02,220
[Huh?]

211
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:05,829
Get out!

212
00:13:08,978 --> 00:13:10,812
I hope you die of old age in there!

213
00:13:13,038 --> 00:13:15,733
[Their teamwork causing some concern...]

214
00:13:17,957 --> 00:13:20,108
[Now off to the balance beams
for the second leg of the course.]

217
00:13:28,071 --> 00:13:30,008
[It seems as though it fell off while
he was forcibly dragged over to his side.]

218
00:13:30,008 --> 00:13:31,851
My button fell off!

219
00:13:35,307 --> 00:13:37,027
- What do I do about this?
- Just hurry up!

220
00:13:37,028 --> 00:13:39,272
- Just take them off!
- Hurry up!

221
00:13:44,207 --> 00:13:45,762
Yours is that one!

222
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:52,578
[Must do two flips to pass.]

223

[His pants...]

224
00:13:59,252 --> 00:14:02,554
[Welcome to hell...

[The Tiger's ultimate revenge.]

228
00:14:21,893 --> 00:14:24,372
[Kkuk is in the process of
passing through the loop already.]

229
00:14:26,872 --> 00:14:29,004
[Running close to the finish line first?]

230
00:14:29,004 --> 00:14:30,536
Your pants!

231
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,055
[They're falling...]

232
00:14:33,594 --> 00:14:36,505
[Pants falling down automatically...]

233
00:14:36,506 --> 00:14:38,675
- Are you crazy?
- You have to pull them up!

234
00:14:51,378 --> 00:14:53,195
Kwang Soo won.
Kwang Soo won.

235

- I can't fit through this at all!
- Kwang Soo won.

[Kwang Soo wins...]

238
00:15:02,904 --> 00:15:04,043
You really are a piece of work.

239

[A battered victory.]

240
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,178
[The curse of his wide shoulders.]

241
00:15:14,486 --> 00:15:16,649
I can't I believe I lost to Kwang Soo.

242
00:15:17,163 --> 00:15:18,873
What are you going to do later
if you don't have your pants on?

243
00:15:21,432 --> 00:15:24,402
[People that look like Kwang Soo
has no sense of shame?]

244
00:15:26,825 --> 00:15:31,548
[On top of that,
quite a crowd is watching...]

245
00:15:32,214 --> 00:15:33,844
Seriously though, Ji Hyo...

[Bending his leg over to
force him down.]

[Another flip onto the ground.]

259
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:33,720
Song Ji Hyo... it's only because where you're
standing is higher up than where I am.

260

[Neck to neck competition.]

261
00:16:44,965 --> 00:16:47,138
[Off to the ocean for the final leg.]

262
00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:48,927
Ah! That's so cold!

263

[What got into the Big-nosed Brother
to be so helpful?]

294

[Figured as much...]

295
00:19:21,736 --> 00:19:23,585
Why don't you help her out to the end?

296
00:19:30,198 --> 00:19:32,760
[Trying to take the loop away
from her...]

297
00:19:34,846 --> 00:19:36,528

[Wow! Ji Woo succeeds!]

301
00:19:57,674 --> 00:20:00,722
- Will you be able to do it like that?
- I'm fine. Everything's covered.

302

[They need to get started on the race
between Ji Woo and the Giraffe...]

303
00:20:02,754 --> 00:20:05,678
- I'm okay, seriously.
- He can go to the playoff level.

304
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:08,396
- You think you can do it?
- You're moving up due to your lack of dress.

305

[He's going to keep playing like that?]

306
00:20:09,891 --> 00:20:14,459

[Thing that's been prepared for him
in this case of emergency is...]

Okay, just play then. Play.

- He can do it. He can totally do it.
- They're just like baggy pants.

318

They haven't said start yet.
Why are you trying to go to my side?

324
00:21:13,202 --> 00:21:16,017
I have noticed that beautiful women
tend to get annoyed easily and pout.

325
00:21:16,018 --> 00:21:17,730
I have noticed that in all the
beautiful women.

326

Kwang Soo looks like a roasted chicken.

[Baggy roasted chicken
almost out of the tire tunnel.]

332
00:22:04,514 --> 00:22:06,325
- Your pants!
- Put your pants on!

00:22:08,125 --> 00:22:10,741
[Baggy pants reformed into
a pair of loose pants.]

334

- Kwang Soo, put your pants on!

335
00:22:14,995 --> 00:22:18,304

it comes to her body gags.]

- They're awesome!

338
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:29,495

disappearance act.]

344

[A fierce battle in the water.]

345
00:22:54,227 --> 00:22:57,643
- Kwang Soo, just give up!
- Just put your pants back on!

346
00:22:57,644 --> 00:22:59,721
Kwang Soo,
just go grab the other one!

347
00:22:59,722 --> 00:23:01,749
My neck already went through the loop!

348

the playoffs!]

[Heroine of tragic love stories
falling down in exhaustion.]

354

Ji Woo, are you okay?
You have to play in the final round.

355
00:23:28,007 --> 00:23:29,724
Choi Ji Woo, come on!

356
00:23:30,837 --> 00:23:32,436
I have to do it again?

357
00:23:32,437 --> 00:23:35,153
- Against who?
- Me. Me!

358
00:23:35,511 --> 00:23:36,975
I don't want to!

359
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:39,113

her partner will be gained!]

She has to gather the stars and
get to the final location.

368

are already aware of the truth.]

from getting the stars.]

[Oops! My leg is too short.]

383

- His leg...
- His leg is too short!

384
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:07,559
[Finding the leg flip too difficult
with the difference of their height.]

385
00:25:13,722 --> 00:25:16,622
- Ji Woo, you have to go through it too.
- Just go through the other one.

386
00:25:16,623 --> 00:25:18,646
Ji Woo really is putting
a lot of effort into it.

387
00:25:21,776 --> 00:25:23,770
[Oh my... more physical gags.]

388

He's so cruel!

392
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:44,191
It has to be somewhat of a competition
for the game to be any fun.

393
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:49,144
[Oh? Lending out a helping hand?]

394

[Pulling the leg flip on her
once more.]

396

Ji Woo!

398
00:26:00,609 --> 00:26:02,234
<i>What if she doesn't do the flips?</i>

399
00:26:02,722 --> 00:26:04,471
[Fine...]

[Ro-Ro in the process of making
the pass through the loop.]

401
00:26:09,643 --> 00:26:11,637
Don't come! Don't come near me!

402
00:26:12,811 --> 00:26:15,803
[The ultimate ending...]

403
00:26:17,082 --> 00:26:18,644
- Come here.
- Why?

404
00:26:18,645 --> 00:26:19,986
Come here!

405
00:26:21,219 --> 00:26:22,629
[Retreating backwards.]

406
00:26:23,726 --> 00:26:26,984
- Here, pull this up.
- Why? Why should I do that?

407
00:26:26,985 --> 00:26:28,234
[Pull off the loop that he's already
passed through halfway?]

408
00:26:29,602 --> 00:26:31,573
- Why are you pulling this off!
- Hang on a minute...

409
00:26:31,574 --> 00:26:34,214
What do I do...
what should I do now?

410
00:26:35,451 --> 00:26:36,656
Go Eun!

411
00:26:37,512 --> 00:26:39,541
Ji Woo keeps putting her
arms around me!

412
00:26:39,542 --> 00:26:42,238
[Trips him over with her leg.]

413
00:26:49,505 --> 00:26:50,766
No!

414
00:26:56,983 --> 00:27:02,082
[The music indicating that ultimately,
they will end up running.]

415
00:27:02,082 --> 00:27:06,655
[In the end, they will end up running...]

416

[Desperate Ji Woo.]

417
00:27:21,386 --> 00:27:23,448
What are you doing?

418
00:27:24,330 --> 00:27:26,082
[Ro-Ro ultimately succeeds at
passing through the loop.]

419
00:27:30,424 --> 00:27:32,032
What are you guys doing?

420
00:27:33,105 --> 00:27:36,397
Let me go, Ji Woo!
How in the world are you this strong?

421
00:27:36,842 --> 00:27:37,863
Let go of me!

422
00:27:38,352 --> 00:27:40,604
[She's almost through the loop?]

423
00:27:40,605 --> 00:27:44,021
[I don't think so!]

424
00:27:46,556 --> 00:27:48,705
[Ro-Ro stretching out his arm
past the finish line.]

425

[Ro-Ro wins]

426
00:27:54,061 --> 00:27:57,754
- Why did you have to go that far?
- You should've been more gentle with her.

427
00:27:57,755 --> 00:27:59,792
- She's a Hallyu star, after all.
- Is the star that important to you?

428
00:27:59,912 --> 00:28:02,712
[Good job...]

429
00:28:03,474 --> 00:28:05,621
[You didn't give any indication,
and that sounded good.]

430
00:28:06,622 --> 00:28:09,491
[This is my specialty.]

431
00:28:11,112 --> 00:28:13,988
[In the end, Ha Ha wins the star.]

432
00:28:13,988 --> 00:28:16,199
I won!

433
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,707
- Good for you.
- I trampled Choi Ji Woo!

434
00:28:20,361 --> 00:28:22,584
- Look at how happy is to have beat her.
- Seriously...

435
00:28:22,585 --> 00:28:24,964
- Here is your star.
- Can't we share it?

436
00:28:26,133 --> 00:28:28,580
- Can we share it? Let's share it.
- What's the big deal about that star?

437
00:28:28,581 --> 00:28:32,741
- That star, seriously...
- The star truly does belong to Ha Ha.

438
00:28:34,812 --> 00:28:38,623
[Choi Ji Woo vs. Running Man.]

439
00:28:40,372 --> 00:28:45,212
- Ji Woo... hey, I can't believe...
- I almost lost to her though.

440
00:28:45,858 --> 00:28:47,933
She was working so hard at it.

441
00:28:47,934 --> 00:28:49,674
I thought she was just going to give
half the effort she did and quit.

442
00:28:50,184 --> 00:28:53,691
I'm so jealous of people that can pull off
physical gags without trying.

443
00:28:53,692 --> 00:28:55,734
Kwang Soo...
seriously, he's unbeatable with that.

444
00:28:56,405 --> 00:28:58,973
- Are you okay?
- You can lower your speech with me.

445
00:28:58,974 --> 00:29:00,773
Okay, Kwang Soo.

446
00:29:01,523 --> 00:29:04,362
Stop acting so bashful.
I've watched the show in the past.

447
00:29:06,203 --> 00:29:08,547
- I noticed you do that with all the ladies.
- No, I don't.

448
00:29:08,548 --> 00:29:11,193
[Ji Woo's spot-on monitoring.]

449
00:29:11,194 --> 00:29:14,108
Kwang Soo likes actresses.

450
00:29:15,634 --> 00:29:17,679
[Is Ji Woo the perfect woman who embodies
everything Kwang Soo wants in a woman?]

451
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:19,983
You have everything he's looking for.
An older woman who's also an actress.

452
00:29:19,984 --> 00:29:21,872
This is why I can't date anyone.

453
00:29:22,730 --> 00:29:25,635
[You don't? Or you can't?]

454
00:29:25,636 --> 00:29:27,608
By the way, you're ugly.

455
00:29:29,086 --> 00:29:31,042
Don't you think that he's
being too harsh?

456
00:29:31,043 --> 00:29:34,135
Kwang Soo... being ugly
is actually kind of a trend lately.

457
00:29:34,136 --> 00:29:36,990
That's right. That's nothing
to feel bad about right now.

458
00:29:36,991 --> 00:29:40,491
- It's not a trend!
- It's a trend, Gary.

459
00:29:40,492 --> 00:29:43,556
Ji Woo, which one of us
do you think is best looking?

460
00:29:43,557 --> 00:29:45,916
- Out of you guys?
- Not counting the popularity.

461
00:29:45,917 --> 00:29:49,169
Ji Woo, don't feel bad about it, and
tell us who the best and worst looking is.

462
00:29:49,170 --> 00:29:51,109
Should I tell you in the order of
best to worst looking?

463
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:52,710
- Yeah, start with best looking. Who's first?
- Starting with best looking?

464
00:29:52,711 --> 00:29:54,365
First place would be...

465
00:29:55,355 --> 00:29:57,368
- I pick Jong Kook.
- Thank you!

466
00:29:58,331 --> 00:30:00,358
- Okay, then how about second?
- Second?

467
00:30:00,359 --> 00:30:03,530
- I don't even care about the first place.
- You can't count the age either.

468
00:30:03,531 --> 00:30:06,538
- Then Ji Suk Jin would be second.
- That's just absurd!

469
00:30:06,539 --> 00:30:09,986
Come on, Ji Woo!
You know that's not right!

470
00:30:10,251 --> 00:30:13,057
- Maybe she's just trying to be funny.
- I just look weirder on screen, that's all.

471
00:30:13,058 --> 00:30:15,584
- Okay, it's been funny so far.
- I see that you have a funny side to you.

472
00:30:15,585 --> 00:30:17,405
Then you want me to tell you the third?
Ha Ha!

473
00:30:17,406 --> 00:30:19,370
[Third place is, Ha Ha.]

474
00:30:19,371 --> 00:30:20,560
Ji Woo!

475
00:30:20,561 --> 00:30:23,328
[The lower rank people
desperately calling out Ji Woo's name.]

476
00:30:23,789 --> 00:30:25,853
Starting with fourth,
you guys are all pretty much the same.

477
00:30:26,565 --> 00:30:29,972
[Calling fourth through sixth a tie.]

478
00:30:31,085 --> 00:30:32,356
Ji Woo!

479
00:30:33,578 --> 00:30:36,484
Gary! Why aren't you even
saying anything?

480
00:30:36,485 --> 00:30:38,323
It's the same thing I hear
all the time!

481
00:30:40,728 --> 00:30:43,348
- Kwang Soo, seriously...
- I don't know how I feel about this.

482
00:30:43,348 --> 00:30:45,452
You know what this means, right?
You're in seventh place.

483
00:30:47,602 --> 00:30:50,352
[Then he's voted to be the least attractive
out of all the Running Man members?]

484
00:30:50,749 --> 00:30:55,139
- She says that you're not that attractive.
- I used to be really popular.

485
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:56,165
I know that you're popular.

486
00:30:56,165 --> 00:30:57,447
I've heard people saying that
you're attractive before.

487
00:30:57,447 --> 00:30:59,431
Really? Where? Where?

488
00:31:00,374 --> 00:31:03,754
- Don't you think you're being too much?
- Wait, calm down.

489
00:31:04,347 --> 00:31:07,567
- Don't you think you're all being too much?
- This is great comedy!

490
00:31:07,568 --> 00:31:11,013
Ji Woo... I really
didn't take you to be like that.

491
00:31:11,014 --> 00:31:14,062
- Wow, this is great. You're hilarious.
- It's getting hot in here.

492
00:31:17,794 --> 00:31:20,655
[Climbing up the steep road...]

493
00:31:20,655 --> 00:31:24,179
[All the beautiful and

494
00:31:24,179 --> 00:31:28,182
[A village reminiscent of the colors
in traditional hanboks.]

495
00:31:28,183 --> 00:31:31,135
- Doesn't it have a certain feel to it?
- It's so beautiful.

496
00:31:32,302 --> 00:31:34,305
Thank you for all your hard
work to get here.

497
00:31:34,305 --> 00:31:35,704
[Busan's Gamcheon Cultural Village]

498
00:31:35,704 --> 00:31:36,827
This place is so beautiful.

499
00:31:36,828 --> 00:31:38,980
I never knew such beautiful place
existed in Busan.

500
00:31:38,981 --> 00:31:41,830
- It's just so beautiful!
- It looks like a European village.

501
00:31:41,831 --> 00:31:44,402
This place makes me think
of Santorini in Greece.

502
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:48,394
<i>This place is referred to as
Santorini of Busan.</i>

503
00:31:48,873 --> 00:31:50,373
I was thinking this place
looked like Santorini.

504
00:31:50,373 --> 00:31:51,415
Is there anything you don't know?

505
00:31:51,415 --> 00:31:54,508
I'm getting the same feeling I did
when I was in Montpellier in Europe.

506
00:31:54,508 --> 00:31:56,876
What did you say?
You're thirsty?

507
00:31:56,877 --> 00:31:59,738
[In this beautiful village...]

00:31:59,739 --> 00:32:01,095
[Battle of the Stars - Second mission.]

509
00:32:01,095 --> 00:32:04,358
<i>We have prepared something special for
you guys to wish you luck in year 2013.</i>

510
00:32:05,124 --> 00:32:08,073
- This is 'The Amazing Quiz'.
- Amazing Quiz?

511
00:32:08,752 --> 00:32:11,454
You know that we're not good
at quizzes.

512
00:32:11,455 --> 00:32:15,498
<i>The category of the quiz is,
Choi Ji Woo.</i>

513
00:32:15,499 --> 00:32:16,885
What the heck does that mean?

514
00:32:22,194 --> 00:32:24,919
[Is everyone ready?]

515
00:32:26,888 --> 00:32:30,010
[Second mission - Choi Ji Woo Quiz.]

516
00:32:30,566 --> 00:32:36,531
[Everyone was already aware of it...]

517
00:32:36,532 --> 00:32:39,238
- So we're already going to know what it is?
- We'll be prepared for the mission.

518
00:32:39,788 --> 00:32:43,254
<i>You just need to make sure that
Choi Ji Woo comes in last in the mission.</i>

519
00:32:43,255 --> 00:32:45,618
If we know the answers to difficult questions,
I bet that will really fluster her.

520
00:32:46,104 --> 00:32:49,124
<i>These questions are going to be
simple for Choi Ji Woo.</i>

521
00:32:49,125 --> 00:32:50,693
- And I'm sure you can see that for yourself.
- Yes, you're right.

522
00:32:50,694 --> 00:32:53,581
- But you will... already know the answers.
- We'll already know the answers, right?

523
00:32:53,582 --> 00:32:57,203
The first thing Choi Ji Woo says to
Bae Yong Joon on the bus in 'Winter Sonata'?

524
00:32:57,203 --> 00:32:59,528
'Just what were you doing
not waking me up?'

525
00:33:00,390 --> 00:33:02,803
I don't know if I can be natural
when I say things like this.

526
00:33:03,215 --> 00:33:06,854
Who's the writer that wrote the drama
that became really popular in Japan in 2006?

527
00:33:07,323 --> 00:33:08,694
Watanabi Muziki!

528
00:33:08,694 --> 00:33:10,686
[Who?]

529
00:33:11,695 --> 00:33:14,308
[I bet she'll be flustered...]

530
00:33:14,309 --> 00:33:17,011
But if we're too good with the answers,
I bet she'll get suspicious.

531
00:33:17,012 --> 00:33:19,131
Don't you think she'll get suspicious
if we answer too many questions right?

532
00:33:19,132 --> 00:33:23,782
- She may not know some of these herself.
- We have to act dumb on some of these too.

533
00:33:23,783 --> 00:33:26,671
- She may not know all of them herself.
- We have to act like we're stumped too.

534
00:33:26,672 --> 00:33:28,205
[Will they be able to pull it off?]

535
00:33:28,205 --> 00:33:31,362
But wouldn't that put Ji Woo at too much
of an advantage if they're all about her?

536
00:33:31,363 --> 00:33:33,617
[Ji Woo feeling energized knowing
that the questions are about herself.]

537
00:33:33,911 --> 00:33:35,520
<i>Listen carefully to the questions</i>

538
00:33:35,521 --> 00:33:38,734
<i>and you have to break these bowls
on your head and shout out 'This is awesome'.</i>

539
00:33:38,734 --> 00:33:41,131
[Break it on your head,
and shout out 'This is awesome!']

540
00:33:41,132 --> 00:33:43,576
<i>And to those that pass the quiz,
a running ball will be given to them.</i>

541
00:33:43,576 --> 00:33:45,048
- Running ball?
- Instead of a star?

542
00:33:45,048 --> 00:33:48,228
<i>First place will be given
seven running balls.</i>

543
00:33:48,779 --> 00:33:51,336
<i>Second place will receive six,
and the fifth place will receive five.</i>

544
00:33:51,337 --> 00:33:52,614
<i>And the person who comes in last
won't receive any.</i>

545
00:33:52,614 --> 00:33:56,884
<i>Then all the balls will be put in a drawing,
and one will be chosen at random.</i>

546
00:33:56,885 --> 00:33:58,408
Is that why you're giving us the stars?

547
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:02,876
Wow, you're not making it easy for us
to get those stars.

548
00:34:02,877 --> 00:34:05,294
I really do know quite a bit about
Ji Woo personally, though.

549
00:34:05,295 --> 00:34:08,777
- I know quite a bit too.
- I think I know a good bit too.

550
00:34:08,778 --> 00:34:11,537
- Since she's been in so many projects...
- I know more than you'd think too.

551
00:34:11,538 --> 00:34:13,485
There could be things that we know
about her that she may not know herself.

552

[We're going to knock her socks off...]

553
00:34:17,729 --> 00:34:20,300
Since she's just so famous to begin with,
we can't help but know a few things about her.

554
00:34:20,301 --> 00:34:22,267
- I even know what your first commercial was.
- What was it?

555
00:34:22,268 --> 00:34:24,510
I can't tell you that right now.
It could end up being one of the questions.

556
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:31,527
<i>Okay, here comes your first question.</i>

557
00:34:31,986 --> 00:34:33,959
<i>In the drama...</i>

558
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,838
<i>Beautiful days...</i>

559
00:34:37,051 --> 00:34:41,656
<i>Where did Lee Byung Hyun and
Choi Ji Woo share their first kiss?</i>

560
00:34:41,657 --> 00:34:45,537
[Where did Lee Byung Hyun and Choi Ji Woo
share their first kiss in 'Beautiful Days'?]

561
00:34:45,537 --> 00:34:47,302
[It seems as though Ji Woo
also knows the answer?]

562
00:34:47,303 --> 00:34:49,222
- I know this!
- No!

563
00:34:54,156 --> 00:34:56,316
[Fortunately, Jae Suk is first to arrive.]

564
00:34:58,188 --> 00:35:01,902
[He needs to remember the answer...]

565
00:35:02,348 --> 00:35:04,156
Who in the world doesn't know
the answer to that question?

566
00:35:05,128 --> 00:35:06,870
Who wouldn't know the answer to that?

567
00:35:06,871 --> 00:35:09,555
I saw this!
I saw that drama!

568
00:35:09,556 --> 00:35:12,811
- Beautiful days... I know I saw it.
- You know the answer, don't you?

569
00:35:12,812 --> 00:35:16,392
- Choi Ji Woo, it was...
- I'm just a little unsure...

570
00:35:19,745 --> 00:35:21,872
This is pretty tough.

571
00:35:26,595 --> 00:35:29,472
[Will he be able to remember correctly?]

572
00:35:29,473 --> 00:35:31,777
You can answer the question
once you break the bowl on your head.

573
00:35:36,852 --> 00:35:38,575
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

574
00:35:38,576 --> 00:35:40,470
That really startled me.

575
00:35:40,869 --> 00:35:45,152
[And the correct answer is...]

576
00:35:45,153 --> 00:35:48,010
- You have to get it right.
- I'm a little confused with the scene.

577
00:35:50,602 --> 00:35:52,378
[Does he know? Does he know?]

578
00:35:53,069 --> 00:35:56,224
[He remembers, doesn't he?]

579
00:35:56,224 --> 00:35:58,266
[Answer: Inside a car by the ocean.]

580
00:35:58,808 --> 00:36:00,601
Inside a car by the ocean!

581
00:36:00,602 --> 00:36:02,750
- No, he's wrong.
- Inside a car by the ocean!

582
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:04,903
No, he's wrong.

583
00:36:05,511 --> 00:36:07,874
[What? It's not?]

584
00:36:07,875 --> 00:36:09,549
It's not?

585
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:13,185
- No, it's not. It was at the other place
- Wrong. He's wrong.

586
00:36:14,481 --> 00:36:17,750
[Then was the answer on the
sheet wrong?]

587
00:36:17,751 --> 00:36:19,299
- That's not the place.
- Then where was it?

588
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:20,726
Where did it take place?

589
00:36:22,443 --> 00:36:25,251
[Let's verify.]

590
00:36:26,063 --> 00:36:28,238
[Main leads of 'Beautiful Days', Ji Woo
and Lee Byung Hyun's first kiss scene.]

591
00:36:28,238 --> 00:36:37,511
[Whew! Inside a car by the ocean
is the correct answer!]

592
00:36:40,182 --> 00:36:42,359
- No, it's not.
- Then where? Where was it?

593
00:36:42,852 --> 00:36:44,280
I'm sure she's right.

594
00:36:45,458 --> 00:36:46,809
I'm sure she's right.

595
00:36:47,372 --> 00:36:49,360
[Inside the car by the ocean
is the correct answer!]

596
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:50,916
[That was the right answer?]

597
00:36:54,559 --> 00:36:56,266
Which scene are you talking about?

598
00:37:00,394 --> 00:37:04,982
That was much after the kiss scene
we had in front of the recording scene.

599
00:37:04,983 --> 00:37:06,590
[Ah... I guess there's that
kiss scene too.]

600
00:37:07,998 --> 00:37:12,604
I'm talking about the scene in the beginning.
The other one is practically a bed scene.

601
00:37:12,605 --> 00:37:15,655
- Come on, that's not a simple kiss scene.
- There was a bed scene?

602
00:37:16,278 --> 00:37:18,402
- In 'Beautiful days'?
- Bed scene?

603
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:20,926
- There's a kiss scene before the bed scene.
- Let's make this one a practice one then.

604
00:37:20,927 --> 00:37:22,901
- I took the later one as the main kiss scene.
- You're right.

605
00:37:22,902 --> 00:37:26,317
You're right. You're right too, but
the record store scene is prior to that.

606
00:37:26,318 --> 00:37:28,290
[Even though he's right, the record store
scene earlier is the real first kiss scene.]

607
00:37:28,290 --> 00:37:29,937
Come on. It was my drama.
I'd know.

608
00:37:32,273 --> 00:37:34,567
- Am I not right?
- You may be remembering it wrong though.

609
00:37:35,404 --> 00:37:37,764
Once she starts arguing her point like this,
there won't be an end to it.

610
00:37:37,765 --> 00:37:39,252
[I guess you're right.]

611
00:37:39,253 --> 00:37:42,348
- Is there proof of any kind?
- What happens now? Wasn't I right?

612
00:37:42,349 --> 00:37:45,005
<i>After checking into it,
by the ocean is the first kiss scene.</i>

613
00:37:45,006 --> 00:37:47,054
<i>So Yoo Jae Suk had the
correct answer.</i>

614
00:37:47,794 --> 00:37:50,409
You're the weird one here.
How in the world did you know that?

615
00:37:50,410 --> 00:37:53,624
- How did you know that?
- You've got a dirty mind. That's what it is!

616
00:37:53,625 --> 00:37:56,013
I sort of had an idea,
but I wasn't sure.

617
00:37:56,014 --> 00:37:58,153
- I wasn't sure.
- What was it about?

618
00:37:58,154 --> 00:37:59,863
What was the drama,
'Beautiful Days' about?

619
00:38:00,489 --> 00:38:03,110
- What's the drama about?
- It's about their love, what else?

620
00:38:04,093 --> 00:38:06,065
'Beautiful Days' is about their love.

621
00:38:06,066 --> 00:38:10,049
- Then how does it end?
- What do you mean? It doesn't work out.

622
00:38:10,050 --> 00:38:11,549
- It doesn't work out?
- It doesn't work out.

623
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:13,561
- It doesn't work out?
- No, it has a happy ending.

624
00:38:14,553 --> 00:38:16,607
Wait, which drama were we
talking about?

625
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,852
You're confused about the two, aren't you?
It's understandable to get mixed up.

626
00:38:19,853 --> 00:38:22,997
<i>And if he only watched it sporadically,
it's understandable to be confused.</i>

627
00:38:24,215 --> 00:38:26,217
[A risky joke being played out.]

628
00:38:26,218 --> 00:38:30,357
- You kissed one too many times.
- I kissed way too many times.

629
00:38:30,358 --> 00:38:31,801
It's so confusing at times.

630
00:38:31,802 --> 00:38:34,891
Dramas can shoot their scenes
in reverse at times, right?

631
00:38:34,892 --> 00:38:36,320
- It could be confusing.
- Yes, it's confusing.

632
00:38:36,321 --> 00:38:39,197
Ji Woo has tendencies to argue her points
a little strongly, doesn't she?

633
00:38:40,425 --> 00:38:42,116
Her style is a bit...

634
00:38:44,647 --> 00:38:47,587
<i>Okay, Jae Suk just gained
seven Running balls.</i>

635
00:38:47,588 --> 00:38:49,926
- Here's your second question.
- You have to be run quickly.

636
00:38:49,927 --> 00:38:51,303
- You have to run up there quickly.
- Really?

637
00:38:51,304 --> 00:38:54,467
<i>In the drama, 'Winter Sonata'...</i>

638
00:38:54,468 --> 00:38:57,499
- In 'Winter Sonata'...
- There it is! I saw the whole drama!

639
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:59,913
- I saw the whole drama!
- Who in the world didn't see that drama?

640
00:38:59,914 --> 00:39:01,781
I saw that drama twice!

641
00:39:02,983 --> 00:39:08,515
<i>What is the piano song that Bae Yong Joon
plays for Ji Woo in the auditorium?</i>

642
00:39:08,515 --> 00:39:10,130
I know that one!

643
00:39:12,232 --> 00:39:13,796
<i>I know the answer to that one.</i>

644
00:39:13,797 --> 00:39:15,028
- I know that one.
- I know the answer.

645
00:39:15,029 --> 00:39:17,216
[Oh? It looks like she remembered?]

646
00:39:17,217 --> 00:39:18,708
I just have to break this
on my head now, right?

647
00:39:18,709 --> 00:39:21,810
- Okay, this is awesome.
- Wait. Ji Woo, what's your answer?

648
00:39:24,899 --> 00:39:27,931
I know the exact answer to that.
I'm such a huge fan of 'Winter Sonata'.

649
00:39:27,932 --> 00:39:29,804
[Winter Sonata's fan, Gary.]

650
00:39:30,291 --> 00:39:32,705
The piano song that Bae Yong Joon
plays for Ji Woo in the auditorium.

651
00:39:32,706 --> 00:39:35,129
Trumerei (Reverie)... Trumerei...

652
00:39:35,130 --> 00:39:37,763
[The piano song in question is, Trumerei.
A difficult title to even pronounce.]

653
00:39:37,763 --> 00:39:39,935
['Winter Sonata' fan working hard
to memorize all the answers.]

654
00:39:41,851 --> 00:39:43,607
Trumerei!

655
00:39:43,608 --> 00:39:44,698
<i>- Why do you want to know that?
- What did you say?</i>

656
00:39:44,699 --> 00:39:46,513
- Trumerei.
- You're wrong!

657
00:39:46,514 --> 00:39:47,703
- No, that's not it.
- No, you're wrong.

658
00:39:47,704 --> 00:39:49,232
Trumerei!

659
00:39:49,233 --> 00:39:51,647
Trumerei. Tru... merei.

660
00:39:52,187 --> 00:39:55,049
- You're wrong. You got it wrong.
- There's no way I got that wrong.

661
00:39:55,050 --> 00:39:56,777
You have no idea how much
I love that song!

662
00:39:57,453 --> 00:40:02,209
In that scene, Bae Yong Joon says he can't
play the piano and then he all of a sudden...

663
00:40:02,210 --> 00:40:03,861
Ji Woo...

664
00:40:03,862 --> 00:40:05,818
[Is he right?]

665
00:40:07,217 --> 00:40:15,438
[The song Bae Yong Joon plays for Choi Ji Woo
in the auditorium in 'Winter Sonata'.]

666
00:40:15,438 --> 00:40:19,439
[Schumann's Trumerei. (Reverie)]

667
00:40:19,439 --> 00:40:24,284
But in that scene... doesn't Bae Yong Joon
tell me what the title of the song is?

668
00:40:24,285 --> 00:40:28,512
When I ask towards the end, 'What is this',
he tells me what it is, doesn't he?

669
00:40:28,513 --> 00:40:30,522
I see now that your memory is
starting to come and go, doesn't it?

670
00:40:31,137 --> 00:40:34,524
I... I don't know...
I don't think I know anymore.

671
00:40:35,289 --> 00:40:37,633
- What are you doing?
- I don't know... I don't know.

672
00:40:37,634 --> 00:40:38,937
Trumerei.

673
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:41,489
- Trumerei?
- I can't believe he's right!

674
00:40:41,490 --> 00:40:43,607
How did you know that?
How did you know it was called, Trumerei?

675
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:45,730
- You really do like the song, huh?
- Of course, I do!

676
00:40:45,731 --> 00:40:48,601
He starts playing the song on the piano
after telling her that he can't play.

677
00:40:48,602 --> 00:40:50,448
<i>Who's the composer of the piece?</i>

678
00:40:50,449 --> 00:40:52,139
Come on... the composer isn't important.

679
00:40:52,703 --> 00:40:56,358
What the heck? What's her problem?
How does she not know anything about herself?

680
00:40:56,359 --> 00:40:57,791
What did you think it was?

681
00:40:57,792 --> 00:40:59,236
I don't remember.

682
00:40:59,237 --> 00:41:01,911
<i>You have just won six Running Balls.</i>

683
00:41:02,767 --> 00:41:04,785
What do I do?

684
00:41:04,786 --> 00:41:07,665
You guys really don't know
enough about Ji Woo.

685
00:41:07,666 --> 00:41:10,258
How... how did you know that?

686
00:41:10,259 --> 00:41:13,765
- I'm a total fan of that drama.
- Show me, which song are you talking about?

687
00:41:19,087 --> 00:41:21,828
[If anyone is caught,
the filming stops right away.]

688
00:41:21,829 --> 00:41:23,292
I don't remember it at all.

689
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:28,462
[But... that's...]

690
00:41:28,462 --> 00:41:29,846
That's the Godfather!

691
00:41:31,142 --> 00:41:32,382
<i>That's the Godfather.</i>

692
00:41:33,624 --> 00:41:36,538
[She wants to hear Trumerei...]

693
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,718
I guess I got the shows wrong.

694
00:41:45,472 --> 00:41:47,108
[Even I know that's from The Godfather.]

695
00:41:49,030 --> 00:41:50,517
No, no!

696
00:41:50,848 --> 00:41:53,036
- You look good against the backdrop.
- Yeah, you do.

697
00:41:53,037 --> 00:41:55,085
So what's the third question?

698
00:41:55,086 --> 00:41:56,657
<i>Five Running Balls hang on this question.</i>

699
00:41:56,658 --> 00:41:58,671
- I have to get it done this time.
- Ji Woo, you have to do better this time.

700
00:41:58,672 --> 00:42:00,576
How can she not get any right
when they're all about her?

701
00:42:01,045 --> 00:42:04,263
- In the drama, 'Winter Sonata'...
- 'Winter Sonata'!

702
00:42:05,029 --> 00:42:07,447
Aren't there going to be any questions
about 'Stairway to heaven'?

703
00:42:07,448 --> 00:42:14,060
<i>In the scene where Choi Ji Woo and
Bae Hyung Joon first meet on the bus...</i>

704
00:42:14,510 --> 00:42:17,756
- I... can I answer this one?
- I know this one. I know it.

705
00:42:17,757 --> 00:42:19,317
[A scene that's been remade
several times over!]

706
00:42:19,318 --> 00:42:20,790
I know exactly what the answer is!

707
00:42:26,649 --> 00:42:29,835
[Even Jae Suk remade
the same scene in the past...]

708
00:42:30,751 --> 00:42:34,071
Why don't you...
take your glasses off?

709
00:42:34,203 --> 00:42:36,294
[That won't be pretty...]

710
00:42:44,836 --> 00:42:47,278
I made a remake of that drama scene.
I know the exact answer!

711
00:42:47,278 --> 00:42:49,358
<i>The color of the coat and
the headband Choi Ji Woo</i>

712
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:53,474
<i>is wearing in the bus scene
where they first meet?</i>

713
00:42:53,474 --> 00:42:56,598
[The color of the coat and headband she
wears in the bus scene where they first meet.]

714
00:42:58,187 --> 00:43:02,647
[A scene from 'Winter Sonata'.]

715
00:43:04,094 --> 00:43:05,832
[White and yellow.]

716
00:43:08,108 --> 00:43:11,673
[And of course,
there's Jae Suk's parody.]

717
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:16,028
- I know this one!
- I know the exact answer!

718
00:43:16,029 --> 00:43:18,200
Why are you so late in going up there?

719
00:43:18,201 --> 00:43:19,695
[While everyone's jumping over themselves from
knowing the answer, Ji Woo hangs behind?]

720
00:43:19,696 --> 00:43:22,838
Since the show's gotten so
many re-runs...

721
00:43:22,839 --> 00:43:24,505
- I know this one!
- You know this, don't you?

722
00:43:24,506 --> 00:43:26,352
Why don't you tell me?
Do you know this one?

723
00:43:28,773 --> 00:43:30,029
- The color of the headband...
- The headband...

724
00:43:30,030 --> 00:43:31,651
This is awesome!

725
00:43:33,199 --> 00:43:35,192
[Unable to break the bowl.]

726
00:43:35,193 --> 00:43:37,026
Get out... get out of the way.

727
00:43:38,470 --> 00:43:39,499
This is awesome!

728
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:41,585
I  don't think Ji Woo's right
this time either.

729
00:43:41,586 --> 00:43:43,412
- She doesn't know.
- No, I do know.

730
00:43:44,618 --> 00:43:47,508
- You looked so pretty back then!
- I know that, Suk Jin.

731
00:43:47,509 --> 00:43:49,400
[Her unchanging beauty
even with the flow of time.]

732
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:50,883
I watched it over five times
because you looked so pretty.

733
00:43:50,883 --> 00:43:53,144
- Suk Jin, thank you!
- I'm being serious.

734
00:43:53,145 --> 00:43:58,616
The headband was white,
and the coat was canary yellow.

735
00:43:58,617 --> 00:44:00,224
Yes, he's right.

736
00:44:01,998 --> 00:44:04,192
- Ji Woo knew the answer too.
- Wow, that really is amazing.

737
00:44:04,193 --> 00:44:06,268
Ji Woo, you have to get up
there quicker.

738
00:44:06,848 --> 00:44:08,759
[Don't you find any of this strange?]

739
00:44:09,308 --> 00:44:11,673
[This is unbelievable!]

740
00:44:12,230 --> 00:44:15,778
- Ji Woo, you have to start doing better!
- You have to place something.

741
00:44:15,779 --> 00:44:18,518
I really don't remember any
of the dramas!

742
00:44:19,538 --> 00:44:22,641
How am I supposed to remember something
that happened over ten years ago?

743
00:44:23,391 --> 00:44:26,117
[It seems like she's finally
starting to get angry...]

744
00:44:26,118 --> 00:44:27,961
She's really annoyed right now.

745
00:44:28,815 --> 00:44:31,173
I have done so many more dramas
since those ones!

746
00:44:31,174 --> 00:44:33,377
But when you keep talking about
ones from over 10 years ago...

747
00:44:33,378 --> 00:44:35,567
[My... throat...]

748
00:44:35,568 --> 00:44:38,020
[Why bring up something
from over ten years ago?]

749
00:44:40,197 --> 00:44:43,624
Even though she is annoyed,
she's annoyed in a relaxed way, isn't she?

750
00:44:43,625 --> 00:44:45,849
She actually looks very pretty
while annoyed right now.

751
00:44:45,950 --> 00:44:47,358
<i>Okay, here's your next question.</i>

752
00:44:47,358 --> 00:44:49,120
<i>'Winter Sonata'...</i>

753
00:44:49,788 --> 00:44:51,847
<i>'Stairway to heaven'...</i>

754
00:44:51,848 --> 00:44:53,768
<i>'Air City'...</i>

755
00:44:53,769 --> 00:44:55,218
<i>'Star Lovers'...</i>

756
00:44:55,525 --> 00:44:59,972
<i>and 'Can't lose'. Tell me the names of her
characters in the order of dramas mentioned.</i>

757
00:44:59,972 --> 00:45:03,285
[The names of the characters she played
in the order of the dramas mentioned.]

758
00:45:03,285 --> 00:45:05,690
[Oh no!]

759
00:45:07,986 --> 00:45:09,548
[Ji Woo is the first one to arrive.]

760
00:45:11,557 --> 00:45:14,161
Repeat them again, please.
'Winter Sonata' and...

761
00:45:14,162 --> 00:45:15,973
Jung Woo Jin in 'Winter Sonata'.

762
00:45:16,571 --> 00:45:19,656
I'm right. Jung Woo Jin.
In 'Winter Sonata', I played Jung Yoo Jin.

763
00:45:20,623 --> 00:45:22,816
[She forgot to break the bowl!]

764
00:45:25,173 --> 00:45:26,914
You didn't do that! You didn't do that!

765
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:32,039
- You didn't do that!
- Ji Woo...

766
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:33,661
I can't believe you didn't do that.

767
00:45:33,662 --> 00:45:36,347
My head... my head is killing me!

768
00:45:36,348 --> 00:45:37,687
I bet you're upset.

769
00:45:37,688 --> 00:45:39,438
[Almost shaved ten years
off their lives.]

770
00:45:41,476 --> 00:45:44,322
My head! There's no way he'd
know them all.

771
00:45:44,817 --> 00:45:48,592
You have to hold her in the back.
I don't want her to overhear what I say.

772
00:45:48,593 --> 00:45:51,269
- Keep her turned around.
- You're right. She shouldn't hear you.

773
00:45:51,270 --> 00:45:52,602
But this one here...

774
00:45:52,602 --> 00:45:59,407
'Air City', 'Star's lovers', 'Can't lose'...
memorizing all these names in order...

775
00:45:59,408 --> 00:46:01,465
[Even though they did everything
they could to memorize them...]

776
00:46:01,465 --> 00:46:03,540
[Will they be able to answer correctly?]

777
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:06,062
Her name in 'Star's lover' is Lee Mari.

778
00:46:06,063 --> 00:46:08,061
And in 'Can't lose',
she plays an attorney named Lee Eun Jae.

779
00:46:08,062 --> 00:46:11,366
- Jung Yoo Jin...
- I'm going to say I know the answer.

780
00:46:13,595 --> 00:46:14,689
<i>And the correct answer is?</i>

781
00:46:14,689 --> 00:46:16,792
- 'Winter Sonata'...
- He's not going to know the answers.

782
00:46:16,793 --> 00:46:19,316
- 'Winter Sonata'... Yoo Hae Ji.
- How is he going to know the answers?

783
00:46:19,930 --> 00:46:22,106
One of the answers is Mari.

784
00:46:22,837 --> 00:46:25,227
- Yoon Ji Ae...
- You can't listen in.

785
00:46:25,227 --> 00:46:26,385
'Stairway to Heaven', Kim Ji Hye...

786
00:46:27,965 --> 00:46:30,063
[Ha Ha fails.]

787
00:46:30,579 --> 00:46:33,110
- This is awesome.
- You can't watch. You can't watch.

788
00:46:34,735 --> 00:46:37,779
- It cracked... it did crack.
- Did you hit someone?

789
00:46:37,780 --> 00:46:40,309
Jae Suk... this really hurts.

790
00:46:43,083 --> 00:46:45,560
- Choi Ji Woo would know this question best.
- Jung Yoo Jin?

791
00:46:46,205 --> 00:46:47,847
Han Jung Suh. (Stairway to Heaven).

792
00:46:47,848 --> 00:46:49,489
You can't listen. That won't be fair.

793
00:46:49,490 --> 00:46:50,733
Lee Mari. (Star's lovers).

794
00:46:50,734 --> 00:46:52,343
Lee Eun Jae. (Can't lose).

795
00:46:54,414 --> 00:46:55,536
Did I get it?

796
00:46:55,537 --> 00:46:57,413
- We've got the results.
- What is it?

797
00:46:59,333 --> 00:47:05,819
[Ji Hyo is their only hope...
Did she succeed?]

798
00:47:05,819 --> 00:47:07,712
[Correct answer.]

799
00:47:09,372 --> 00:47:11,278
- You got it right?
- How did you know all that?

800
00:47:11,279 --> 00:47:13,411
[She got that right?]

801
00:47:15,615 --> 00:47:17,773
- You got it right?
- How did you know all that?

802
00:47:17,774 --> 00:47:19,646
<i>Why don't you say them again
from the beginning?</i>

803
00:47:19,647 --> 00:47:21,106
[Again?]

804
00:47:21,788 --> 00:47:25,052
Jung Yoo Ji... I mean, Jung Yoo Jin.

805
00:47:25,052 --> 00:47:27,302
- Get your head on straight.
- Yeah, get your head on straight.

806
00:47:27,303 --> 00:47:31,404
But the thing is this.
Ji Woo, when you memorize things...

807
00:47:31,404 --> 00:47:34,142
[Memorize things?]

808
00:47:34,508 --> 00:47:36,922
[Crap.]

809
00:47:36,922 --> 00:47:38,194
[Huh?]

810
00:47:38,868 --> 00:47:42,486
- Don't you forget things after you're done?
- Yeah, I do. I forget after I'm done.

811
00:47:43,178 --> 00:47:45,684
I'm telling you, I forget once I'm done.
Jung Yoo Jin...

812
00:47:45,685 --> 00:47:48,234
- What were you thinking?
- How can you already forget the names?

813
00:47:48,793 --> 00:47:51,467
[Luckily, she didn't seem to
notice anything.]

814
00:47:53,904 --> 00:47:57,052
[Now the only two left are
Ji Woo and Ha Ha.]

815
00:47:57,053 --> 00:48:00,209
[The person who answers this one right
gets one Running Ball.]

816
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:03,210
But even if we only get one right,
don't we still get to pick later?

817
00:48:03,211 --> 00:48:04,398
- That's right.
- You're right.

818
00:48:04,399 --> 00:48:07,077
[Since the person who comes in last doesn't
get any balls, they've no chances at a star.]

819
00:48:07,078 --> 00:48:11,190
Why don't you concede to me?
You have one already.

820
00:48:11,191 --> 00:48:15,970
- You have one already. Seriously!
- Choi Ji Woo is the problem now.

821
00:48:15,971 --> 00:48:18,885
- How is this happening?
- This really is upsetting!

822
00:48:18,886 --> 00:48:20,968
Ji Woo, what's wrong with you?

823
00:48:20,969 --> 00:48:22,887
I bet this is really embarrassing for you.

824
00:48:22,888 --> 00:48:25,577
- I'm really embarrassed.
- She's really embarrassed.

825
00:48:25,578 --> 00:48:27,045
We're all standing up here
because we all answered a question right.

826
00:48:27,046 --> 00:48:28,521
The important thing is,
these are Choi Ji Woo related questions

827
00:48:28,521 --> 00:48:30,213
but the fact she's still standing there...

828
00:48:30,214 --> 00:48:32,827
- That really is absurd.
- But it really is making me feel happy.

829
00:48:32,828 --> 00:48:34,148
[Huh?]

830
00:48:34,149 --> 00:48:36,180
[Goddess with a positive attitude.]

831
00:48:36,181 --> 00:48:43,964
<i>Choi Ji Woo!
Choi Ji Woo!</i>

832
00:48:43,964 --> 00:48:46,348
To be honest, this really
isn't something to be upset about.

833
00:48:46,349 --> 00:48:48,224
- No, it's not.
- This is really making me feel happy.

834
00:48:48,225 --> 00:48:51,367
- Are you getting them wrong on purpose?
- Maybe I am!

835
00:48:51,906 --> 00:48:53,413
So that we can answer them?

836
00:48:53,772 --> 00:48:56,275
- I'm just testing you guys.
- I guess you are.

837
00:48:56,276 --> 00:48:58,780
- Here comes an easy question.
- Is the question related to me?

838
00:48:58,780 --> 00:49:00,797
<i>Of course.
They're all related to you.</i>

839
00:49:00,798 --> 00:49:03,888
<i>One of the songs on
'Stairway to Heaven's soundtrack...</i>

840
00:49:05,031 --> 00:49:07,911
<i>When Kwon Sang Woo hears
this song...</i>

841
00:49:07,912 --> 00:49:11,375
[When Kwon Sang Woo hears this song from
'Stairway to Heaven's soundtrack...]

842
00:49:12,382 --> 00:49:14,465
[The song that made them run
in the drama...]

843
00:49:16,970 --> 00:49:22,852
[This isn't a question that would
even demand any hesitation!]

844
00:49:27,660 --> 00:49:29,230
Ave Maria.

845
00:49:32,011 --> 00:49:34,646
[Big problem]

846
00:49:35,005 --> 00:49:36,231
Ave Maria.

847
00:49:37,605 --> 00:49:39,930
Ave Maria... that one?

848
00:49:39,931 --> 00:49:42,942
- But that song...
- Wait, this.. I hope it's awesome.

849
00:49:43,682 --> 00:49:45,443
[Huh?]

850
00:49:46,464 --> 00:49:48,132
[Ah! She got the saying wrong!]

851
00:49:53,844 --> 00:49:57,143
[Scrambling for the bowl.]

852
00:50:00,170 --> 00:50:01,494
This is awesome!

853
00:50:01,495 --> 00:50:03,514
Ave Maria!

854
00:50:04,512 --> 00:50:06,575
<i>Ave Maria!</i>

855
00:50:08,113 --> 00:50:11,694
- I won!
- This is awesome... this is awesome.

856
00:50:13,914 --> 00:50:16,374
This isn't going to do.
Come... come here.

857
00:50:17,248 --> 00:50:19,735
Ji Woo, your face is beet red!

858
00:50:25,158 --> 00:50:27,040
She stopped just like this.

859
00:50:29,865 --> 00:50:31,962
What is 'I hope it's awesome'?

860
00:50:34,229 --> 00:50:37,412
Ji Woo... how can you say,
'I hope it's awesome'?

861
00:50:37,413 --> 00:50:39,127
[Because of saying the phrase wrong
even though she had the answer correct...]

862
00:50:40,922 --> 00:50:45,217
- That was so easy. Ave Maria...
- I hope it's awesome? What was that?

863
00:50:45,218 --> 00:50:47,412
I once said 'Jujube head' when
it should've been 'Mugwort head'.

864
00:50:50,109 --> 00:50:52,153
This is seriously...

865
00:50:52,556 --> 00:50:54,528
<i>As I've already told you,
there's only one to be picked.</i>

866
00:50:54,528 --> 00:50:57,098
<i>So the star will be given to
the person who picks the right one.</i>

867
00:50:57,099 --> 00:51:00,341
- This is it! It's mine!
- Are there any duds?

868
00:51:00,342 --> 00:51:01,644
Except for one person,
they're all pretty much duds.

869
00:51:02,313 --> 00:51:05,180
He says they're all duds
except for one!

870
00:51:06,236 --> 00:51:09,970
- Watch this. This is pretty fun.
- This used to be so much fun back in the day.

871
00:51:09,971 --> 00:51:13,126
- It really has been awhile, hasn't it?
- It's like the lottery drawing.

872
00:51:13,127 --> 00:51:17,373
- Okay. It can't be opened anymore.
- Everyone, this star you see is riding on it.

873
00:51:17,374 --> 00:51:19,600
- Please! Please!
- Please!

874
00:51:19,601 --> 00:51:22,402
- I always had such bad luck with this.
- I used to hate getting chosen in the past.

875
00:51:22,741 --> 00:51:24,690
[Who will be the winner of the star?]

876
00:51:24,691 --> 00:51:28,097
- Here we go...
- One, two, three!

877
00:51:30,169 --> 00:51:31,568
We have one!

878
00:51:32,981 --> 00:51:34,967
[And that name is...]

879
00:51:34,968 --> 00:51:37,833
[The end of the year man, Gary.]

880
00:51:38,269 --> 00:51:42,435
[Opening up a ceremony for himself
with the theme song from 'The Godfather'.]

881
00:51:42,436 --> 00:51:44,896
I can't believe I didn't get it
when I had seven balls in there!

882
00:51:45,413 --> 00:51:48,400
- Yes, thank you!
- What to do!

883
00:51:48,401 --> 00:51:51,276
- How can I be so unlucky?
- You should've let it spin around some more.

884
00:51:51,277 --> 00:51:53,368
[So jealous...]

885
00:51:55,813 --> 00:51:58,955
[Choi Ji Woo vs. Running Man.]

886
00:51:59,866 --> 00:52:04,188
[The final mission location -
Horse themed park in Busan.]

887
00:52:04,189 --> 00:52:06,165
<i>- This is the final round of mission.
- Yes.</i>

888
00:52:06,704 --> 00:52:12,552
[The person to gather all seven stars
is the ultimate victor.]

889
00:52:12,553 --> 00:52:15,460
- Then what about the person who has no stars?
- Then they have to go out and find them.

890
00:52:17,947 --> 00:52:24,805
[I was given a secret spy mission...]

891
00:52:24,805 --> 00:52:30,829
[I just need to find my partner to
secretly oust everyone.]

892
00:52:34,021 --> 00:52:36,621
- Should we get started then?
- Yes.

893
00:52:36,622 --> 00:52:39,129
- You shouldn't be in such a rush.
- Go find your stars.

894
00:52:39,675 --> 00:52:44,359
[Not even realizing in her wildest dreams
Running Man cast already knows everything.]

895
00:52:48,986 --> 00:52:50,664
I need to find them quickly.

896
00:52:52,991 --> 00:52:56,977
[I need to start by finding my
spy partner first.]

897
00:52:59,514 --> 00:53:01,799
- Did she leave?
- Not yet... not yet.

898
00:53:05,034 --> 00:53:06,254
What are we going to do now?

899
00:53:06,255 --> 00:53:11,084
Do we have to get ousted by Choi Ji Woo
so that she doesn't catch on to what we know?

900
00:53:11,085 --> 00:53:13,139
- Yeah, that's right.
- So we have to get ousted?

901
00:53:13,140 --> 00:53:15,982
We have to make sure that Ji Woo
collects all seven of the stars.

902
00:53:15,983 --> 00:53:19,386
Since Ha Ha has to be the spy,
I'll get ousted first with my star.

903
00:53:19,387 --> 00:53:21,114
We can't get ousted since
we don't have a star.

904
00:53:21,115 --> 00:53:22,719
Suk Jin, you have to be careful.

905
00:53:22,719 --> 00:53:25,050
- You and Kwang Soo have to be careful.
- What if she comes for me first?

906
00:53:25,051 --> 00:53:28,270
- Let's all rally first.
- Do we really have to do it that way?

907
00:53:29,619 --> 00:53:31,531
One, two, three... fighting!

908
00:53:31,532 --> 00:53:33,985
- Come on, I wasn't even there yet.
- You should've moved faster.

909
00:53:35,523 --> 00:53:36,953
Jae Suk, I'm going to get going.

910
00:53:36,954 --> 00:53:42,458
[Whatever the case, precise planning,
and spot on acting is crucial!]

911
00:53:42,459 --> 00:53:44,054
Then let's do it a little later.
After we find some stars first.

912
00:53:44,055 --> 00:53:49,376
[Spy partner, Ha Ha's role is crucial to buy
the team members some time to find the stars.]

913
00:53:49,377 --> 00:53:53,911
<i>Since you haven't found a star yet,
you need to attach this under your name tag.</i>

914
00:53:53,912 --> 00:53:57,271
Deceive Choi Ji Woo.

915
00:54:02,523 --> 00:54:05,629
[If they get ousted by Choi Ji Woo
before they find a star...]

916
00:54:05,629 --> 00:54:10,250
[Then the whole thing will be blown!]

917
00:54:13,037 --> 00:54:14,893
I have to find a star.

918
00:54:16,594 --> 00:54:20,070
<i>You have already gained a star
from the previous mission.</i>

919
00:54:20,071 --> 00:54:24,360
- You don't need to put this on your back.
- Then I can get ousted with ease?

920
00:54:29,692 --> 00:54:32,742
[Choi Ji Woo vs. Running Man.]

921
00:54:38,098 --> 00:54:40,121
I'm so cold!

922
00:54:40,708 --> 00:54:46,506
[That's the signal she'll be using to
approach her partner during her search!]

923
00:54:47,050 --> 00:54:51,217
Is that what I have to do?
That's too much. Can't I just do one?

924
00:54:51,218 --> 00:54:54,082
[To approach her partner -
Wink and do the chicken dance.]

925
00:54:54,082 --> 00:54:56,850
[Worried people may think
that she's a weirdo.]

926
00:54:57,148 --> 00:54:58,989
[Should I do a practice round?]

927
00:54:59,683 --> 00:55:01,386
How am I supposed to do this?

928
00:55:02,622 --> 00:55:07,614
It's not like... I can say that I'm cold
since we're on the inside now.

929
00:55:09,642 --> 00:55:12,119
I need to use my brain a little.
How am I to do this?

930
00:55:14,958 --> 00:55:18,072
[Spy Ji Woo is on the move!]

931
00:55:23,486 --> 00:55:27,057
I'm going to start
approaching them one by one.

932
00:55:27,058 --> 00:55:31,536
[Who is my spy partner?]

933
00:55:31,536 --> 00:55:34,809
[Is the ultimate deliverer,
Mr. Capable my partner?]

934
00:55:35,596 --> 00:55:37,371
[Or could it be, Ace Ji Hyo?]

935
00:55:37,885 --> 00:55:41,083
[Gary with his serene face?]

936
00:55:41,883 --> 00:55:46,349
[I need to start my approach tactics.
Wait a minute...]

937
00:55:46,350 --> 00:55:50,790
[Should I try approaching
Jae Suk first?]

938
00:55:51,253 --> 00:55:52,829
Ji Woo, did you find any?

939
00:55:52,830 --> 00:55:54,799
Are you coming towards me to
try to rip off my name tag?

940
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:57,161
- Come on...
- No, come here.

941
00:55:58,282 --> 00:55:59,684
No, I'm not going to.

942
00:55:59,685 --> 00:56:01,433
Why? Did you find one?

943
00:56:02,385 --> 00:56:04,565
Look.

944
00:56:05,755 --> 00:56:08,108
[Ji Woo starts her
approach tactics on Jae Suk.]

945
00:56:11,589 --> 00:56:15,346
[Ah... I guess this is
the spy approach signal.]

946
00:56:16,197 --> 00:56:18,980
[Breaking out in laughter
out of embarrassment.]

947
00:56:21,464 --> 00:56:27,097
Jae Suk... if I joke around a little,
you should be more receptive.

948
00:56:27,098 --> 00:56:28,282
Ah, this?

949
00:56:31,455 --> 00:56:33,973
- Where? Where did you find it?
- I didn't find any yet.

950
00:56:34,460 --> 00:56:36,051
I have to go find one.

951
00:56:36,052 --> 00:56:37,320
Be careful of Jong Kook, okay?

952
00:56:37,321 --> 00:56:41,095
[Jae Suk taking his leave after
pretending not to be aware of anything.]

953
00:56:43,617 --> 00:56:45,516
It's not Jae Suk.

954
00:56:46,137 --> 00:56:48,421
When I did this...

955
00:56:48,422 --> 00:56:53,634
[Since there weren't any special responses
even though she did her approach tactics...]

956
00:56:53,635 --> 00:56:55,257
He had no idea what it was about.

957
00:56:58,660 --> 00:57:02,545
That Ji Woo... how can she make it
so obvious?

958
00:57:02,997 --> 00:57:08,993
[Difficult to play dumb when she
makes her approach so obvious.]

959
00:57:08,994 --> 00:57:11,104
Do I really have to play dumb
to everything?

960
00:57:16,182 --> 00:57:19,571
Who knew I'd ever be looking for a star
just so that I can get ousted in ease?

961
00:57:21,718 --> 00:57:26,114
But I feel no burden today.
Since getting ousted is the goal.

962
00:57:35,105 --> 00:57:37,206
[The 'R' mark!]

963
00:57:37,206 --> 00:57:40,020
[Could there be a star inside
the envelope?]

964
00:57:42,323 --> 00:57:43,470
What is this?

965
00:57:43,471 --> 00:57:46,218
[But there's only a piece of paper
inside the envelope?]

966
00:57:47,336 --> 00:57:49,111
[A mission?]

967
00:57:49,112 --> 00:57:52,823
<i>[Put on a step counter and walk at least
100 steps in a squatted position.]</i>

968
00:57:54,163 --> 00:57:56,076
So you're not just giving it to us?

969
00:57:56,443 --> 00:58:01,154
[They're not just given out, but must
complete the mission before gaining the star.]

970
00:58:02,348 --> 00:58:04,424
I have to walk at least 100 steps?

971
00:58:04,425 --> 00:58:07,217
So how do I get the star?
When I complete the mission first?

972
00:58:09,169 --> 00:58:14,311
[With the count set to zero,
and while being prompted by Coach Kook.]

973
00:58:16,681 --> 00:58:21,165
[Will Running Man's weakest link,
Big-nosed Brother be able to do it?]

974
00:58:22,193 --> 00:58:24,071
So this is how it counts?

975
00:58:24,992 --> 00:58:27,727
Good. Good...

976
00:58:27,728 --> 00:58:29,705
What are you doing?
Training me right now?

977
00:58:31,231 --> 00:58:34,456
- Come this way... this way!
- Okay.

978
00:58:34,457 --> 00:58:37,130
- Can you just go away?
- Hurry up and come on.

979
00:58:37,131 --> 00:58:39,122
I feel like you're pressuring me
right now.

980
00:58:39,123 --> 00:58:41,732
We have to work fast to
find more stars.

981
00:58:42,218 --> 00:58:44,198
I have to do 100 of these?
My legs...

982
00:58:44,199 --> 00:58:46,271
- Come on.
- Let's see if I've done 100 yet.

983
00:58:46,272 --> 00:58:48,115
You haven't done it yet.
You've still got long ways to go.

984
00:58:49,498 --> 00:58:54,383
[If the count is below 100 when it's
checked, then the mission is a failure!]

985
00:58:54,384 --> 00:58:56,818
- I'm telling you, you're not there yet.
- And I think I am.

986
00:58:56,819 --> 00:58:59,200
[Will the count be over 100?]

987
00:59:00,953 --> 00:59:04,558
- 88.
- You failed. You have to start over now.

988
00:59:06,066 --> 00:59:09,926
- See? You have to start over now.
- I can't just do 12 more?

989
00:59:11,674 --> 00:59:14,878
Instead of walking, how about jumping?

990
00:59:14,879 --> 00:59:16,846
- Just jump instead.
- Let me get some rest first.

991
00:59:16,847 --> 00:59:19,596
- We don't have the time for that.
- My legs are killing me right now.

992
00:59:19,597 --> 00:59:21,670
I need to get some rest first.

993
00:59:26,457 --> 00:59:29,068
[How is he going to do 100
with those legs of his?]

994
00:59:30,740 --> 00:59:32,649
Just what in the world is all this?

995
00:59:32,650 --> 00:59:34,750
What am I doing?

996
00:59:37,292 --> 00:59:40,470
[Ji Woo starting to make her way
towards their direction.]

997
00:59:41,514 --> 00:59:44,009
[What's Suk Jin doing?]

998
00:59:44,010 --> 00:59:45,568
Suk Jin!

999
00:59:46,362 --> 00:59:48,105
- Did you find it?
- What?

1000
00:59:48,106 --> 00:59:49,683
- Did you find one?
- I haven't found one yet.

1001
00:59:49,684 --> 00:59:51,512
- You haven't found a single one?
- Did you find any?

1002
00:59:51,513 --> 00:59:52,588
No, I haven't.

1003
00:59:53,170 --> 00:59:56,208
- I've been playing around.
- Doing what? Why do you look so tired?

1004
00:59:56,209 --> 00:59:59,393
- I was just playing around with Jong Kook.
- Ugh, I'm so cold.

1005
00:59:59,394 --> 01:00:02,686
- Are you that cold?
- Yes. Yes, I am.

1006
01:00:03,070 --> 01:00:06,564
[I guess it's not Suk Jin either...]

1007
01:00:07,651 --> 01:00:11,284
At last... I'm going to start
my approach.

1008
01:00:11,909 --> 01:00:15,565
[Ha Ha starting his approach strategy
in his role as the spy's partner.]

1009
01:00:15,565 --> 01:00:22,448
[He has to be resourceful and act right
in order not to raise Ji Woo's suspicion.]

1010
01:00:33,707 --> 01:00:36,574
[Finally runs into Ji Woo.]

1011
01:00:36,575 --> 01:00:38,171
How many did you find?

1012
01:00:38,172 --> 01:00:40,421
- I can't tell you that.
- Tell me.

1013
01:00:40,422 --> 01:00:42,082
- Why?
- Just because.

1014
01:00:42,726 --> 01:00:44,986
- Why?
- Come on.

1015
01:00:45,562 --> 01:00:48,486
I'm... working on finding them
right now.

1016
01:00:51,320 --> 01:00:52,635
No?

1017
01:00:53,775 --> 01:00:55,924
[Okay...]

1018
01:00:56,710 --> 01:00:58,571
[Watch carefully.]

1019
01:01:05,266 --> 01:01:08,489
[Ha Ha's response signal is
to act like Rambo.]

1020
01:01:11,344 --> 01:01:15,732
[Haroro responding to her signal with
one of his own with his whole body.]

1021
01:01:21,986 --> 01:01:25,390
[So sorry...]

1022
01:01:27,910 --> 01:01:31,767
[Ha Ha even breaks out his emotional
acting for having found his partner!]

1023
01:01:34,114 --> 01:01:36,572
<i>Leg flip cross!</i>

1024
01:01:37,268 --> 01:01:40,712
[Spy Ji Woo not suspecting a thing,
and feeling relieved at having found Ha Ha.]

1025
01:01:42,143 --> 01:01:45,044
[Checking once more.]

1026
01:01:45,044 --> 01:01:48,802
[Anyways, spy and her partner find
each other successfully.]

1027
01:01:48,802 --> 01:01:50,889
Lets go find who has a star first.

1028
01:01:50,890 --> 01:01:53,164
[Of course...]

1029
01:01:53,164 --> 01:01:58,149
[Gullible Ji Woo... Feeling relieved
at having found her partner.]

1030
01:01:58,892 --> 01:02:04,213
[Lol... nice!
So it's up to me now, isn't it?]

1031
01:02:09,313 --> 01:02:11,681
[Discovers Ji Woo and Ha Ha
who have now found each other!]

1032
01:02:12,536 --> 01:02:15,649
[Okay... time to get caught...]

1033
01:02:16,931 --> 01:02:21,049
[Haroro convincing Ji Woo they should
go up and capture Gary.]

1034
01:02:21,049 --> 01:02:23,985
- How many have you found? Give me one.
- I only have this one.

1035
01:02:24,724 --> 01:02:28,260
- Why aren't you looking for any?
- I am looking, but haven't found any yet.

1036
01:02:28,261 --> 01:02:33,521
[Everyone has to be on the ball
with their acting skills now!]

1037
01:02:35,161 --> 01:02:41,199
[Gary has to let Ji Woo get him
without giving her any signs of anything...]

1038
01:02:42,001 --> 01:02:46,279
- Why are you walking back there alone?
- I'm afraid of someone ripping mine off.

1039
01:02:47,714 --> 01:02:50,375
Jae Suk is acting suspicious though.

1040
01:02:50,376 --> 01:02:52,214
[Just then!]

1041
01:02:52,215 --> 01:02:55,184
[Gary leaving his back wide open!]

1042
01:02:55,184 --> 01:02:59,779
[Spy Ji Woo on the move!]

1043
01:03:03,658 --> 01:03:05,870
[Ji Woo succeeds in eliminating Gary!]

1044
01:03:07,597 --> 01:03:10,927
[Top billing acting! Realistic expression!]

1045
01:03:14,826 --> 01:03:16,830
[I'm sorry, Gary.]

1046
01:03:17,653 --> 01:03:19,402
[Rushing off to jail before
breaking down in laughter.]

1047
01:03:20,973 --> 01:03:24,933
[Gary succeeds in getting ousted by
Ji Woo without indicating anything.]

1048
01:03:25,823 --> 01:03:29,930
That was pretty difficult.
That one scene...

1049
01:03:29,931 --> 01:03:33,989
[But the mission of having to not give
anything away is more difficult than thought!]

1050
01:03:35,953 --> 01:03:39,890
- Gary, Out. Gary, out.
- So it's begun.

1051
01:03:40,597 --> 01:03:41,785
It's begun.

1052
01:03:41,786 --> 01:03:45,284
<i>Gary, Out. Gary, out.</i>

1053
01:03:47,649 --> 01:03:51,020
Gary... Gary, nice job!

1054
01:03:51,321 --> 01:03:52,997
Thanks for your hard work!

1055
01:03:54,259 --> 01:03:56,651
I wonder if Kang Gary acted okay?

1056
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:07,552
Jae Suk... will you count for me?

1057
01:04:08,236 --> 01:04:10,664
- What's your mission?
- Step counter.

1058
01:04:10,665 --> 01:04:13,346
I have to take 100 steps in
a squat position.

1059
01:04:14,678 --> 01:04:17,338
Your knees just made a crackling sound.

1060
01:04:18,364 --> 01:04:22,554
[Mission aside,
may have to head to the hospital first...]

1061
01:04:23,548 --> 01:04:25,664
[In such plain sight like that...]

1062
01:04:27,254 --> 01:04:28,553
Did you find one?

1063
01:04:29,782 --> 01:04:33,877
[Of all things, to get caught having
to do a mission like that...]

1064
01:04:39,925 --> 01:04:41,409
Why are you doing your
new year's greetings already?

1065
01:04:41,409 --> 01:04:43,485
To all our viewers,
I wish you a happy new year.

1066
01:04:43,486 --> 01:04:47,610
[While he's already down there,
saying a humble new year's greetings.]

1067
01:04:47,611 --> 01:04:51,193
- You really are so humble.
- Yeah, you really are.

1068
01:04:57,415 --> 01:05:00,595
[Maybe he should take some training
from Coach Kook in the new year...]

1069
01:05:01,487 --> 01:05:03,277
What are you doing?

1070
01:05:03,471 --> 01:05:05,901
[We're in big trouble!]

1071
01:05:05,901 --> 01:05:09,828
[She can't figure out that
there are missions involved!]

1072
01:05:09,828 --> 01:05:12,428
[Did she notice anything?]

1073
01:05:16,248 --> 01:05:19,025
[And then she just walks on by...]

1074
01:05:20,420 --> 01:05:23,967
[Rushing off to a spot where he can't
be seen to avoid her suspicion.]

1075
01:05:25,798 --> 01:05:28,655
[Just how many squatted steps
did he take earlier?]

1076
01:05:28,656 --> 01:05:30,871
If it's 88 steps again this time...

1077
01:05:30,872 --> 01:05:32,910
Crap, 93 steps.

1078
01:05:32,911 --> 01:05:37,047
[This time, 93 steps.
Fails at 100 squatted steps again!]

1079
01:05:37,048 --> 01:05:39,731
I almost had it...
I'm about to go crazy.

1080
01:05:39,732 --> 01:05:41,842
Only 93 steps when I did all those?

1081
01:05:41,843 --> 01:05:45,311
[Will Big-nosed Brother be able to
complete his mission?]

1082
01:05:47,871 --> 01:05:49,906
[On the other hand...]

1083
01:05:51,657 --> 01:05:54,746
[Giraffe in the process of
checking out the studio room.]

1084
01:05:56,544 --> 01:05:58,832
You haven't seen any envelopes
around, have you?

1085
01:06:02,935 --> 01:06:05,435
[Oh! Discovers an 'R' envelope
underneath the keyboard!]

1086
01:06:06,032 --> 01:06:11,616
<i>[Jump up and stick five pieces
of paper on the ceiling.]</i>

1087
01:06:11,617 --> 01:06:13,254
This is it.

1088
01:06:13,255 --> 01:06:15,504
This mission is tailor made for me!

1089
01:06:15,505 --> 01:06:18,436
Who else but me would be able to
get this mission done?

1090
01:06:18,437 --> 01:06:21,892
[Will the Giraffe be able to
beat this mission?]

1091
01:06:24,932 --> 01:06:27,270
<i>- I found one... I found one.
- Hurry up and do it here.</i>

1092
01:06:27,271 --> 01:06:28,584
- Hurry.
- Do it quickly.

1093
01:06:28,585 --> 01:06:31,386
[Stick five pieces of paper on the ceiling.]

1094
01:06:39,282 --> 01:06:40,310
[It stuck!]

1095
01:06:41,453 --> 01:06:44,477
[An impossible mission had it been
Ha Ha who found it.]

1096
01:06:45,422 --> 01:06:47,176
[Total of five pieces of paper.
Time to stick the second piece!]

1097
01:06:53,160 --> 01:06:56,543
[Kwang Soo's height at last
becoming useful at something!]

1098
01:07:01,514 --> 01:07:05,152
[He did it!]

1099
01:07:05,152 --> 01:07:08,347
[Lee Kwang Soo succeeds in his mission
to win himself a star.]

1100
01:07:09,442 --> 01:07:13,409
[Doing a pose after pulling off
the mission.]

1101
01:07:14,641 --> 01:07:19,289
[Now he can be ousted by
Ji Woo with ease.]

1102
01:07:22,048 --> 01:07:24,200
- Here's your star.
- Thank you.

1103
01:07:24,201 --> 01:07:28,399
[Now... should I start
making my move to get ousted?]

1104
01:07:29,853 --> 01:07:33,948
[On the other hand, Blank Ji starting to get
nervous from not having found her star.]

1105
01:07:37,876 --> 01:07:39,879
[Discovers an 'R' marked envelope!]

1106
01:07:39,879 --> 01:07:42,641
[Just what is the mission contained within?]

1107
01:07:44,427 --> 01:07:51,429
<i>[Approach Choi Ji Woo's name tag and change
it to' Choi Ja Woo' without her knowing.]</i>

1108
01:07:57,699 --> 01:08:02,276
[Must change the 'Ji' to a 'Ja' with the
pen in order to gain her star!]

1109
01:08:03,199 --> 01:08:06,679
I can't even get close to her name tag
now that Gary's been ousted!

1110
01:08:06,680 --> 01:08:09,597
[If she gets close to her at all,
Ji Woo is going to try to oust her...]

1111
01:08:10,792 --> 01:08:14,212
[Time to request backup.]

1112
01:08:15,527 --> 01:08:17,217
- Hi, Ji Hyo.
- Ha Ha...

1113
01:08:18,051 --> 01:08:22,716
I just found an envelope,
but the mission that I have to do...

1114
01:08:23,126 --> 01:08:28,560
I have to approach Ji Woo's name tag and
change it from 'Choi Ji Woo' to 'Choi Ja Woo'.

1115
01:08:29,189 --> 01:08:33,782
[Asking for him to distract Ji Woo while
Ji Hyo changes the name from the back!]

1116
01:08:33,783 --> 01:08:36,057
- You're with Ji Woo, aren't you?
- Yeah.

1117
01:08:36,058 --> 01:08:38,720
- I'll come to you right now, okay?
- Okay.

1118
01:08:39,661 --> 01:08:44,083
[May be able to pull it off with Ha Ha's help!
Time to put spy partner to work.]

1119
01:08:45,445 --> 01:08:50,292
[Ji Woo trying to approach Big-nose Brother
to oust him this time.]

1120
01:08:50,292 --> 01:08:53,879
[No... he doesn't have his star yet.]

1121
01:08:56,183 --> 01:08:57,819
- What?
- What are you doing, Suk Jin?

1122
01:08:58,906 --> 01:09:02,232
- Did you find a star? Did you find one?
- What? No, I haven't found one yet.

1123
01:09:02,233 --> 01:09:04,865
Where is it? Let me see.
You hid away your star, didn't you?

1124
01:09:05,774 --> 01:09:09,726
[If he gets ousted without a star first,
she's going to see 'Deceive Choi Ji Woo' sign]

1125
01:09:11,306 --> 01:09:13,902
- Want to walk around together?
- Shall we?

1126
01:09:13,903 --> 01:09:15,900
Why don't we join forces for now?

1127
01:09:15,901 --> 01:09:18,784
Why work with Suk Jin?
Leave him out of it.

1128
01:09:18,784 --> 01:09:22,452
[Leave Suk Jin out!]

1129
01:09:22,453 --> 01:09:25,201
[A scratch on his self-esteem.]

1130
01:09:25,806 --> 01:09:28,769
[Even in Ji Woo's eyes,
he's the weakest link.]

1131
01:09:29,182 --> 01:09:31,524
- Did you all find a star?
- What about you?

1132
01:09:31,525 --> 01:09:33,070
- I don't have one.
- I don't have one either.

1133
01:09:33,572 --> 01:09:35,395
Suk Jin,
come back after you find one.

1134
01:09:35,395 --> 01:09:37,474
- I understand. I'll be back.
- You know what I mean, right?

1135
01:09:37,475 --> 01:09:39,386
- You know what I mean, right?
- Yeah, I got it.

1136
01:09:41,297 --> 01:09:42,479
My pride seriously took a blow.

1137
01:09:43,072 --> 01:09:45,263
[Ha Ha, what do I do?]

1138
01:09:47,709 --> 01:09:49,369
This is seriously driving me crazy.

1139
01:09:49,370 --> 01:09:52,025
I have to fix her name
with my marker right now.

1140
01:09:59,129 --> 01:10:03,122
[Whispering their plans to one another
while Ji Woo is out of sight.]

1141
01:10:07,297 --> 01:10:09,173
[Just then!]

1142
01:10:09,173 --> 01:10:12,053
[Ace Ji Hyo's name tag
is right in front of her!]

1143
01:10:12,053 --> 01:10:14,747
[I will end it!]

1144
01:10:15,585 --> 01:10:17,378
[But Ji Hyo doesn't have a star!]

1145
01:10:17,378 --> 01:10:21,739
[If she's ousted, then it's
over with Running Man's defeat!]

1146
01:10:24,044 --> 01:10:25,975
[Ji Woo attacks Ji Hyo!]

1147
01:10:25,976 --> 01:10:28,301
[Ji Hyo in danger!]

1148
01:10:28,302 --> 01:10:33,027
[Ha Ha needs to act fast and rescue
Ji Hyo without getting caught!]

1149
01:10:35,741 --> 01:10:37,946
[Oh! Ji Hyo's name tag!]

1150
01:10:37,947 --> 01:10:40,339
[Barely escapes her demise thanks to
Ha Ha getting between her and Ji Woo!]

1151
01:10:40,340 --> 01:10:43,468
Where are you? What are you doing?
Are you going for my name tag now?

1152
01:10:43,469 --> 01:10:46,818
[What's wrong with Ha Ha
all of a sudden?]

1153
01:10:47,824 --> 01:10:51,742
[Everything will be blown if Ha Ha
doesn't handle this right!]

1154
01:10:51,743 --> 01:10:53,103
- Wait..
- What is this?

1155
01:10:53,104 --> 01:10:57,807
[But thankfully, kind hearted Ji Woo is only
concerned for her partner at the moment.]

1156
01:10:57,808 --> 01:10:59,454
- Just go, just go!
- What is this?

1157
01:10:59,455 --> 01:11:02,233
- What's going on right now?
- Don't touch me right now.

1158
01:11:14,746 --> 01:11:18,951
[Transform 'Choi Ji Woo' to 'Choi Ja Woo'!
Will Ji Hyo be able to get it done?]

1159
01:11:18,952 --> 01:11:21,644
- I don't have any right now.
- I'm seriously going to get mad if you do.

1160
01:11:21,645 --> 01:11:22,821
I really will...

1161
01:11:23,226 --> 01:11:26,071
[Just then! Kwang Soo attacks Ha Ha!]

1162
01:11:26,572 --> 01:11:31,780
[Even though they look like they're
fighting, if you look closer...]

1163
01:11:33,435 --> 01:11:37,685
[It's a plan of distraction so that
Ji Hyo can complete her mission!]

1164
01:11:42,452 --> 01:11:44,177
[Too bad!]

1165
01:11:46,305 --> 01:11:48,354
[What's wrong with them
all of a sudden?]

1166
01:11:49,696 --> 01:11:53,391
- What's going on with you two?
- Are you two working together?

1167
01:11:53,392 --> 01:11:55,139
No, we're not.
What are you talking about?

1168
01:11:55,140 --> 01:11:56,487
Be careful... both of you.

1169
01:11:58,089 --> 01:12:00,245
I'm just telling you to be
cautious of me.

1170
01:12:00,246 --> 01:12:02,763
Because I'm going to oust all of you.

1171
01:12:02,764 --> 01:12:05,594
But anyways, this isn't the time
for us to be sitting around like this.

1172
01:12:05,595 --> 01:12:08,599
What do you mean, this isn't the time?
You're the one who's acting weird.

1173
01:12:08,600 --> 01:12:10,236
That's what I'm saying.

1174
01:12:10,237 --> 01:12:13,281
We can let Ji Hyo go for now since
she doesn't have any stars.

1175
01:12:13,282 --> 01:12:15,886
But for now, how many does
Jong Kook have?

1176
01:12:15,887 --> 01:12:17,339
He doesn't have any stars.

1177
01:12:17,340 --> 01:12:20,010
What about Gary?

1178
01:12:20,011 --> 01:12:21,799
But Gary's already been ousted.

1179
01:12:21,800 --> 01:12:23,945
- Really?
- Who ousted Gary?

1180
01:12:23,946 --> 01:12:26,030
[Playing it off like she doesn't know.]

1181
01:12:26,031 --> 01:12:30,334
Then why don't the four of us go
to oust someone right now?

1182
01:12:30,335 --> 01:12:31,424
- Yeah, that's a good idea.
- Let's do that.

1183
01:12:31,425 --> 01:12:33,553
I can't trust any of this.

1184
01:12:33,553 --> 01:12:35,612
Whenever I watched the show,
you guys oust each other after saying that.

1185
01:12:35,613 --> 01:12:39,864
- Let's go get Jong Kook first.
- Let's wait until I find a start first.

1186
01:12:39,865 --> 01:12:42,520
- Then let's go get Jong Kook.
- You're with three most trusted people.

1187
01:12:42,521 --> 01:12:45,277
You're the one I trust the least!

1188
01:12:45,277 --> 01:12:47,285
- He's actually pretty loyal.
- No, he isn't.

1189
01:12:47,285 --> 01:12:50,517
- Jae Suk is the problem.
- Really? Then let's go.

1190
01:12:50,518 --> 01:12:53,311
- Fighting. One, two, three...
- Fighting.

1191
01:12:55,655 --> 01:12:58,724
- See? You're acting strange.
- Should we do it again? Okay, let's redo it.

1192
01:12:58,725 --> 01:13:00,528
One, two, three... fighting.

1193
01:13:03,603 --> 01:13:05,153
Forget it. Let's not even do it.

1194
01:13:05,154 --> 01:13:08,317
[Truly innocent and gullible Ji Woo...
not even the slightest bit of suspicion.]

1195
01:13:08,767 --> 01:13:10,489
Seriously!

1196
01:13:19,155 --> 01:13:22,148
[You're still at it?]

1197
01:13:22,945 --> 01:13:27,611
[Doing a year's worth of leg workouts
in one session.]

1198
01:13:27,612 --> 01:13:29,311
I have to make movements like this
for the counts to go up.

1199
01:13:32,883 --> 01:13:35,034
I feel like I'm shooting
a documentary by myself.

1200
01:13:36,164 --> 01:13:38,330
A documentary about a dad making it.

1201
01:13:38,331 --> 01:13:42,043
[Instead of that, how about a middle aged
man not getting enough exercise?]

1202
01:13:42,796 --> 01:13:46,508
I'm going to jump over there
and check the counter.

1203
01:13:46,509 --> 01:13:48,128
Please...

1204
01:13:56,856 --> 01:13:58,986
[What... what is he doing?]

1205
01:13:58,987 --> 01:14:02,848
[Is that a special dance to bring up
the count on the step counter?]

1206
01:14:03,540 --> 01:14:05,068
Gangnam style...

1207
01:14:06,228 --> 01:14:09,748
[Anyways, he really is working hard
at getting it done.]

1208
01:14:13,838 --> 01:14:16,178
What is that?
Who's crawling around over there?

1209
01:14:16,179 --> 01:14:19,630
[Ji Woo! Big trouble!
He needs to make his escape quickly!]

1210
01:14:19,631 --> 01:14:22,912
[Running away at top speed!]

1211
01:14:25,494 --> 01:14:29,033
I can't... I can't do it anymore.
Just leave me out of it.

1212
01:14:29,034 --> 01:14:31,719
I'm not doing it.
If I failed again, I'm not doing it anymore.

1213
01:14:35,868 --> 01:14:37,646
231...

1214
01:14:37,647 --> 01:14:40,514
[Succeeds with 231!]

1215
01:14:40,514 --> 01:14:44,668
[Side effect - Having done
too many has paralyzed his legs.]

1216
01:14:45,878 --> 01:14:47,737
[Why was Suk Jin squat walking?]

1217
01:14:52,250 --> 01:14:55,877
<i>- Why do you keep doing that?
- No kidding. What are you doing?</i>

1218
01:14:56,792 --> 01:14:58,928
What the heck?
Why are you doing that?

1219
01:14:58,929 --> 01:15:01,880
- I'm trying to work out a cramp.
- Are you by any chance...

1220
01:15:02,830 --> 01:15:09,144
[Suk Jin, are you by any chance...]

1221
01:15:09,145 --> 01:15:12,593
Suk Jin, are you by any chance
sitting on top of a star right now?

1222
01:15:12,594 --> 01:15:14,578
Are you sitting on top of a
star right now?

1223
01:15:17,438 --> 01:15:18,924
Lift up your butt.

1224
01:15:20,534 --> 01:15:22,789
- Why are you asking me that?
- I think you are.

1225
01:15:23,781 --> 01:15:28,120
[Ha Ha working to get her away
to move to another location.]

1226
01:15:30,176 --> 01:15:33,882
[Almost got into big trouble
after barely completing the mission...]

1227
01:15:34,130 --> 01:15:35,494
Okay.

1228
01:15:35,495 --> 01:15:38,018
[Suk Jin finally gets his star!]

1229
01:15:38,019 --> 01:15:41,036
[The sign is now removed from his back
ensuring his safety!]

1230
01:15:42,863 --> 01:15:43,996
All set.

1231
01:15:43,997 --> 01:15:46,174
Let's go get ousted and go to jail.

1232
01:15:49,114 --> 01:15:52,376
[My legs...]

1233
01:15:52,376 --> 01:15:53,529
This is so embarrassing.

1234
01:15:54,832 --> 01:15:58,410
- I have to find a star quickly.
- Come here, come here.

1235
01:15:58,411 --> 01:16:01,801
- The thing we need to do is... come here.
- We can't go around in a group like this.

1236
01:16:02,896 --> 01:16:06,709
[Ha Ha trying to distract her so that
Ji Hyo can complete her mission.]

1237
01:16:06,710 --> 01:16:10,552
Why don't we make a tiny mark on our
name tag to indicate we're on the same team?

1238
01:16:10,553 --> 01:16:14,245
[A sign of alliance?
A mark on their name tags?]

1239
01:16:14,246 --> 01:16:16,408
Why don't we make a small mark
on our name tags?

1240
01:16:16,409 --> 01:16:21,315
[Ah... use that opportunity to change
'Choi Ji Woo' to 'Choi Ja Woo'...]

1241
01:16:21,315 --> 01:16:26,368
[Turning their heads so that Ji Woo
can't see that she's laughing.]

1242
01:16:30,479 --> 01:16:32,862
We need a marker or something.
Hey, do you have a marker of sorts?

1243
01:16:32,863 --> 01:16:34,719
[Ji Woo not even realizing in her
wildest dreams that this is Ji Hyo's mission.]

1244
01:16:35,846 --> 01:16:37,469
Ji Woo!

1245
01:16:37,470 --> 01:16:41,218
[No choice but to follow since all the
others are saying they should do it...]

1246
01:16:43,439 --> 01:16:46,917
[Adding a mark to Ha Ha's back first
to show that they're working together!]

1247
01:16:46,918 --> 01:16:48,837
[Changing Ha Ha to Hya Ha.]

1248
01:16:48,837 --> 01:16:52,140
[Changes Lee Kwang Soo to
Lee Kwang Shu.]

1249
01:16:52,141 --> 01:16:54,336
[At last, it's Ji Woo's turn.]

1250
01:16:54,337 --> 01:16:57,405
- Ji Yoo?
- No, change it to Ja. Ja Woo.

1251
01:16:57,406 --> 01:16:58,419
Ja Woo.

1252
01:16:59,917 --> 01:17:01,464
You have to mark it more.
You can't even tell it's there.

1253
01:17:01,465 --> 01:17:03,249
That's too light.

1254
01:17:03,250 --> 01:17:06,159
[Done. Choi Ja Woo!]

1255
01:17:06,160 --> 01:17:09,995
- Song Ji Hyong? Ja Hyo?
- Ja... do a 'Ja'.

1256
01:17:09,996 --> 01:17:11,972
- Okay, all done.
- Done?

1257
01:17:11,973 --> 01:17:15,051
- Okay, fighting.
- One, two, three... fighting.

1258
01:17:15,052 --> 01:17:16,928
[Even a cheer to close the deal.]

1259
01:17:16,928 --> 01:17:20,290
But why did we all come in here?
Just so we can do that?

1260
01:17:20,290 --> 01:17:22,406
We came in here to mark our names?

1261
01:17:22,976 --> 01:17:25,333
Why did we do that?
When we all recognize who we are.

1262
01:17:28,928 --> 01:17:32,269
[Ji Hyo rushing off to escape far away.]

1263
01:17:32,269 --> 01:17:35,484
[I seriously thought...
I was going to die of laughter.]

1264
01:17:36,150 --> 01:17:38,065
- You succeeded your mission.
- Okay.

1265
01:17:38,066 --> 01:17:40,210
[Succeeded in changing
'Choi Ji Woo' to 'Choi Ja Woo'!]

1266
01:17:40,210 --> 01:17:44,048
[Now she can get ousted
to her heart's content!]

1267
01:17:48,822 --> 01:17:52,552
Ji Woo... I'm sorry for
turning you into Choi Ja Woo.

1268
01:17:54,324 --> 01:17:58,902
[Running Man's victory is slowly
approaching closer.]

1269
01:18:01,252 --> 01:18:03,043
Ji Woo! Come in here.

1270
01:18:03,044 --> 01:18:05,001
We have three stars between us, right?

1271
01:18:05,002 --> 01:18:09,050
[I need to get ousted without
making it seem obvious too...]

1272
01:18:12,200 --> 01:18:15,418
[Kwang Soo all of a sudden is in need
to re-tie his shoe lace!]

1273
01:18:16,754 --> 01:18:19,362
[Kwang Soo... you're a genius!]

1274
01:18:20,375 --> 01:18:23,218
[Signaling to her immediately
to oust Kwang Soo!]

1275
01:18:23,218 --> 01:18:26,982
[The glint in Ji Woo's eyes
changes in a flash!]

1276
01:18:27,947 --> 01:18:30,002
[But... his shoes don't even have
any shoelaces at all.]

1277
01:18:30,893 --> 01:18:33,172
[But Ji Woo doesn't suspect a thing.]

1278
01:18:36,095 --> 01:18:39,043
- What are you going to do without your tag?
- Ji Woo, you're awesome!

1279
01:18:40,104 --> 01:18:44,129
[Must move him off to jail before
Kwang Soo burst out in laughter!]

1280
01:18:49,321 --> 01:18:53,508
<i>[Lee Kwang Soo, out!
Lee Kwang Soo, out!]</i>

1281
01:18:53,509 --> 01:18:57,352
[On the other hand,
Yoo-ruce Willis has yet to find a star.]

1282
01:19:05,674 --> 01:19:09,523
<i>[Scream out 'Ji Woo' and
it must reach over 125 decibels.]</i>

1283
01:19:13,057 --> 01:19:16,209
[Noise measuring device!
It must be done here!]

1284
01:19:16,209 --> 01:19:21,601
[If he screams out the name,
Ji Woo is sure to run over to him.]

1285
01:19:23,233 --> 01:19:26,133
Ji Woo!

1286
01:19:28,244 --> 01:19:30,396
[Must be over 125 decibels.
Fails from registering at 121.8.]

1287
01:19:30,397 --> 01:19:33,996
- What are you doing?
- This is my mission.

1288
01:19:33,996 --> 01:19:36,552
[Rushing to do it again
before Ji Woo comes over.]

1289
01:19:36,553 --> 01:19:38,190
Choi Ji Woo.

1290
01:19:39,320 --> 01:19:42,638
Ji Woo!

1291
01:19:44,859 --> 01:19:46,403
Choi Ji Woo!

1292
01:19:46,404 --> 01:19:48,306
<i>Choi Ji Woo!</i>

1293
01:19:49,821 --> 01:19:51,474
Who was that?

1294
01:19:51,475 --> 01:19:57,120
Ji Woo...Choi Ji Woo!

1295
01:19:58,782 --> 01:20:01,539
[Too bad...]

1296
01:20:03,986 --> 01:20:07,917
[Ji Woo starting to head over
his way after hearing the shouts.]

1297
01:20:08,428 --> 01:20:11,781
- She can't know this is a mission...
- No, she can't find out.

1298
01:20:15,718 --> 01:20:18,349
- Who ousted Kwang Soo?
- I did.

1299
01:20:18,820 --> 01:20:20,420
- You did? Really?
- Yeah.

1300
01:20:20,822 --> 01:20:23,576
- How?
- I just did.

1301
01:20:23,576 --> 01:20:26,086
- Wasn't I supposed to just rip it off?
- Yeah, you are.

1302
01:20:26,087 --> 01:20:27,282
That's what I did.

1303
01:20:29,343 --> 01:20:31,282
- Ji Woo... Choi Ji Woo!
- Yeah?

1304
01:20:31,886 --> 01:20:35,843
[Jae Suk! If you do that,
she may get suspicious!]

1305
01:20:36,544 --> 01:20:37,665
Yes?

1306
01:20:38,633 --> 01:20:43,801
[Even though he's doing that right in front
of her, not the slightest bit of suspicion.]

1307
01:20:43,802 --> 01:20:45,716
- What is it?
- Did you really oust him?

1308
01:20:47,061 --> 01:20:52,120
[Sensible. Continuing his conversation
so that she doesn't get suspicious of him.]

1309
01:20:52,684 --> 01:20:54,725
[Amazing wit and improv skills!]

1310
01:20:54,726 --> 01:20:56,446
Yes, I ousted him.

1311
01:20:56,993 --> 01:20:59,350
- Why?
- Jae Suk, just let it all out.

1312
01:20:59,351 --> 01:21:02,034
- Just turn to the wall, and let it all out.
- Ji Woo...

1313
01:21:02,035 --> 01:21:05,016
- Ji Woo. Choi Ji Woo!
- There you go. Good.

1314
01:21:05,017 --> 01:21:08,169
- Choi Ji Woo! Choi Ji Woo!
- Good! Get it out!

1315
01:21:08,939 --> 01:21:12,530
[Just what in the world is going on?]

1316
01:21:14,245 --> 01:21:18,098
[On the other hand, one final person
who has yet to find a star mission.]

1317
01:21:19,460 --> 01:21:23,271
[A suspicious room with the door ajar?]

1318
01:21:23,272 --> 01:21:25,988
I didn't think there was a door
to this place.

1319
01:21:27,358 --> 01:21:30,677
I thought there was a door in the back...

1320
01:21:30,677 --> 01:21:33,170
[At last, Mr. Capable finds
a mission envelope!]

1321
01:21:39,143 --> 01:21:43,138
<i>[Find a member to play the peppero game
and leave only 2cm behind.]</i>

1322
01:21:43,871 --> 01:21:46,662
Who's still left alive? Jae Suk...

1323
01:21:47,508 --> 01:21:54,804
[Then he's going to play
the game with Jae Suk?]

1324
01:21:56,075 --> 01:21:57,318
Ji Woo...

1325
01:21:57,802 --> 01:21:59,656
Choi Ji Woo!

1326
01:22:01,618 --> 01:22:07,201
[Two members without a star!
If Ji Woo ousts even one, then Ji Woo wins!]

1327
01:22:08,467 --> 01:22:09,769
Ji Woo.

1328
01:22:10,867 --> 01:22:12,662
Choi Ji Woo!

1329
01:22:12,663 --> 01:22:14,277
Choi Ji Woo!

1330
01:22:17,655 --> 01:22:20,463
You think this is the time to laugh?
You can still laugh about this?

1331
01:22:20,464 --> 01:22:22,818
How can you laugh right now?

1332
01:22:23,663 --> 01:22:27,540
- Choi Ji Woo!
- Ji Woo, forget him and just come here.

1333
01:22:27,541 --> 01:22:30,653
I think I'm just going to oust him.
He's being way too loud.

1334
01:22:31,601 --> 01:22:35,111
[This is trouble...
Jae Suk doesn't have his star yet!]

1335
01:22:37,009 --> 01:22:39,931
[Screaming again with all his might.]

1336
01:22:41,961 --> 01:22:46,247
[It seems as though the rating goes up more
when he screams at a higher octave.]

1337
01:22:46,931 --> 01:22:50,871
Ji Woo... Choi Ji Woo!

1338
01:22:50,872 --> 01:22:52,721
Choi Ji Woo!

1339
01:22:55,687 --> 01:22:59,053
[Choi Ji Woo is closing in
on him from behind!]

1340
01:23:01,464 --> 01:23:04,593
[He finally succeeds but if he's caught now,
then everything is over!]

1341
01:23:06,529 --> 01:23:08,681
[Jae Suk avoids elimination by a hair!]

1342
01:23:09,882 --> 01:23:11,806
You startled me.
I could've been in trouble.

1343
01:23:11,807 --> 01:23:15,333
[If he escapes too fast, she may pursue,
so he calmly starts walking away.]

1344
01:23:15,333 --> 01:23:17,881
- Why are you so startled?
- Of course, I'm startled.

1345
01:23:18,853 --> 01:23:22,440
I was going to flutter in like a butterfly
and sting him like a bee.

1346
01:23:26,333 --> 01:23:27,806
[Anyways, he did scream out
Ji Woo's name above 125 decibels.]

1347
01:23:27,806 --> 01:23:30,401
[Jae Suk succeeds his mission!]

1348
01:23:30,402 --> 01:23:32,050
- Here it is.
- Yes, give it to me.

1349
01:23:32,548 --> 01:23:35,306
[Jae Suk finally feeling reassured
after gaining his star.]

1350
01:23:35,307 --> 01:23:39,078
That could've been trouble...
She almost ousted me. That was close.

1351
01:23:41,377 --> 01:23:46,148
[This time, it's Big-nosed Brother
right in front of her.]

1352
01:23:47,250 --> 01:23:51,061
[There's no one around watching, right?]

1353
01:23:52,419 --> 01:23:55,586
[Target locked.]

1354
01:24:00,859 --> 01:24:03,901
[Ji Woo succeeds in eliminating
Suk Jin's name tag!]

1355
01:24:03,901 --> 01:24:06,148
[Big-nosed Brother's perfect
acting skills!]

1356
01:24:06,149 --> 01:24:09,613
<i>Ji Suk Jin, out!
Ji Suk Jin, out!</i>

1357
01:24:22,015 --> 01:24:24,085
- What is it?
- Come on... hurry.

1358
01:24:25,049 --> 01:24:32,206
[Must play the peppero game with
another person to leave behind 2cm!]

1359
01:24:32,207 --> 01:24:33,558
What the heck is that?

1360
01:24:33,559 --> 01:24:36,487
[Kind of creepy and weird
between two men!]

1361
01:24:36,488 --> 01:24:38,366
Then should I call Ji Hyo over?

1362
01:24:38,926 --> 01:24:40,271
Seriously, am I supposed to
call Ji Hyo over instead?

1363
01:24:40,272 --> 01:24:43,173
I was so afraid that you were
already ousted.

1364
01:24:43,174 --> 01:24:46,128
- Then I'd have to find Ji Hyo.
- You should go get Ji Hyo. You have to.

1365
01:24:46,129 --> 01:24:47,718
Just do it!

1366
01:24:47,719 --> 01:24:51,292
[Like it or not, it's man on man!
Just 2cm behind...]

1367
01:24:54,060 --> 01:24:56,913
Look at him biting that end so that
he doesn't have to eat the chocolate.

1368
01:24:57,389 --> 01:25:00,401
[Mr. Capable abstaining from sweets.]

1369
01:25:00,401 --> 01:25:03,241
[So he lightly bites down the end.]

1370
01:25:03,242 --> 01:25:04,877
Seriously... just to stay away
from sweets.

1371
01:25:06,183 --> 01:25:07,225
Seriously...

1372
01:25:07,669 --> 01:25:10,197
Come on... what the heck is this?

1373
01:25:10,577 --> 01:25:12,598
I don't like this either!

1374
01:25:12,599 --> 01:25:16,127
It's because I don't have a star.
I'm doing it to earn a star.

1375
01:25:16,809 --> 01:25:19,900
Seriously... you're so ugly.
Do you know how ugly you look up close?

1376
01:25:19,901 --> 01:25:21,837
- Seriously...
- I'm being serious.

1377
01:25:21,838 --> 01:25:25,733
- It's not like I can even oust him.
- Why would you want to do that?

1378
01:25:26,635 --> 01:25:27,663
Just hurry up and do it.

1379
01:25:28,760 --> 01:25:30,727
I can't believe I'm doing this
just for you to get your star...

1380
01:25:30,728 --> 01:25:33,215
[But why are you holding onto
each other's shoulders?]

1381
01:25:33,215 --> 01:25:36,606
- Don't look, don't look.
- Just do it. Let's get this over with.

1382
01:25:37,403 --> 01:25:39,872
[Slowly...]

1383
01:25:39,872 --> 01:25:42,240
[Closer...]

1384
01:25:42,240 --> 01:25:48,896
[Come a little closer...]

1385
01:25:48,896 --> 01:25:51,811
I can't do this!

1386
01:25:52,519 --> 01:25:55,251
- You have to come closer!
- No, you move in.

1387
01:25:55,252 --> 01:25:57,340
- You have to move in since I'm holding it.
- What's the length?

1388
01:25:57,341 --> 01:26:00,242
- That won't work.
- There's way too much left.

1389
01:26:00,243 --> 01:26:02,445
Since I'm biting it down,
you have to move in.

1390
01:26:02,446 --> 01:26:04,689
One person bites down,
and the other one moves in.

1391
01:26:10,206 --> 01:26:13,037
Ji Woo is heading this way right now.

1392
01:26:13,038 --> 01:26:15,591
[There's no time!
Ji Woo is headed their way!]

1393
01:26:15,591 --> 01:26:17,246
[Big trouble... big trouble.]

1394
01:26:17,793 --> 01:26:20,695
[Moving right into their second attempt
with no time to waste.]

1395
01:26:30,006 --> 01:26:32,297
[Enduring it all in order to
succeed the mission.]

1396
01:26:33,372 --> 01:26:36,065
[If it's less than 2cm, mission is a success!
Just what will the results be?]

1397
01:26:36,065 --> 01:26:38,477
[2.3cm. Fails again.]

1398
01:26:42,211 --> 01:26:46,420
[While that is all going on,
Ji Woo is approaching even closer.]

1399
01:26:47,379 --> 01:26:49,471
[Even though it's annoying,
they're jumping into their third attempt.]

1400
01:26:49,471 --> 01:26:52,712
[More drastic now?]

1401
01:26:52,713 --> 01:26:54,003
[Yuck!]

1402
01:26:55,885 --> 01:26:59,366
[Holding down their bile
for the success of the mission.]

1403
01:26:59,366 --> 01:27:00,591
Hurry!

1404
01:27:01,516 --> 01:27:03,510
[Will it be less than 2cm this time?]

1405
01:27:05,109 --> 01:27:08,041
[2.5 cm. Fails again!]

1406
01:27:10,567 --> 01:27:11,599
Hurry up!

1407
01:27:12,300 --> 01:27:15,489
[Their facial expressions are starting to
get darker and darker.]

1408
01:27:23,669 --> 01:27:25,683
Watch who you're spitting at!

1409
01:27:26,238 --> 01:27:28,241
You come in. This time, you come in.

1410
01:27:28,242 --> 01:27:30,550
- You make the move this time.
- Let's just keep doing what we've done.

1411
01:27:30,551 --> 01:27:33,812
He doesn't want to eat the sweets because
he's thinking about himself and his muscles.

1412
01:27:34,107 --> 01:27:36,780
He's afraid that it's going to make
his muscles smaller or something.

1413
01:27:37,708 --> 01:27:40,516
[Ji Woo is getting ever so closer...]

1414
01:27:41,343 --> 01:27:43,305
Just shut your mouth and
bite down on it.

1415
01:27:43,305 --> 01:27:44,498
[There's no time! Must get it
done quickly to get the star!]

1416
01:27:51,107 --> 01:27:52,938
Bite.. bite down on it.

1417
01:27:53,784 --> 01:27:56,111
[It does look pretty short... could it be?]

1418
01:27:56,112 --> 01:27:57,511
Seriously, Kim Jong Kook...

1419
01:27:58,686 --> 01:28:00,997
- If that didn't work, I'm leaving.
- You can't leave!

1420
01:28:02,212 --> 01:28:05,126
[1.8 cm. Success!]

1421
01:28:06,850 --> 01:28:09,482
Seriously...
are you seriously going to be like this?

1422
01:28:09,482 --> 01:28:11,781
What do you mean, be like this?
What else could I do with the mission?

1423
01:28:11,782 --> 01:28:14,661
- You could've just moved closer.
- You could've just ate a little chocolate!

1424
01:28:14,662 --> 01:28:18,538
[Anyways, Jong Kook finally
earns his star.]

1425
01:28:24,229 --> 01:28:26,230
- What? What is it?
- There he is!

1426
01:28:28,248 --> 01:28:33,039
[All they have left is to get ousted now
without raising any suspicion!]

1427
01:28:36,508 --> 01:28:39,562
[Quietly agreeing to Jong Kook
getting ousted first.]

1428
01:28:39,563 --> 01:28:42,981
- Why are you doing this?
- Jae Suk, what's going on?

1429
01:28:42,982 --> 01:28:46,084
[Acting as though they're unable to
trust each other.]

1430
01:28:46,084 --> 01:28:48,130
- Ji Woo, hurry!
- Come on!

1431
01:28:49,719 --> 01:28:51,766
[Ji Woo finally makes her move!]

1432
01:28:51,766 --> 01:28:55,757
[Heading towards Mr. Capable
caught in their grasp!]

1433
01:28:55,758 --> 01:28:58,117
[Realistic acting.]

1434
01:28:59,282 --> 01:29:01,429
[Ji Woo eliminates Jong Kook's
name tag!]

1435
01:29:01,430 --> 01:29:06,294
[Just then! Moving onto
Ji Hyo's name tag right away!]

1436
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:13,926
[Amazing, nonetheless.
Eliminates Mr. Capable and Ace Ji Hyo!]

1437
01:29:16,874 --> 01:29:19,554
[Acting bewildered even as
they're being dragged away to jail.]

1438
01:29:19,555 --> 01:29:22,100
Ji Woo... Ji Woo!

1439
01:29:24,202 --> 01:29:26,097
Good job... good job.

1440
01:29:27,269 --> 01:29:31,200
<i>Kim Jong Kook, out.
Kim Jong Kook, out.</i>

1441
01:29:33,726 --> 01:29:35,087
What the heck?

1442
01:29:35,088 --> 01:29:38,709
Hey... how can you oust
Ji Hyo like that?

1443
01:29:38,710 --> 01:29:40,075
Why not?

1444
01:29:40,076 --> 01:29:43,199
- Why not? Seriously...
- Ji Woo...

1445
01:29:43,200 --> 01:29:47,871
It's not that, but I almost got ousted
by Jong Kook because you took so long.

1446
01:29:47,872 --> 01:29:49,935
I almost got ousted.

1447
01:29:50,309 --> 01:29:53,427
Then shouldn't you be grateful to me
for eliminating Jong Kook for you?

1448
01:29:53,428 --> 01:29:54,859
Shouldn't you be grateful?

1449
01:29:55,787 --> 01:29:58,832
[Jae Suk and Ha Ha's perfect
acting skills!]

1450
01:30:01,629 --> 01:30:04,220
[Ji Woo eliminates Jae Suk's name tag!]

1451
01:30:04,221 --> 01:30:06,689
That was too easy.

1452
01:30:06,690 --> 01:30:08,580
Maybe I'll put it back and do it again.

1453
01:30:13,482 --> 01:30:16,634
<i>Yoo Jae Suk, out.</i>

1454
01:30:17,378 --> 01:30:19,205
Ha Ha, it was you?

1455
01:30:23,131 --> 01:30:24,687
Look at how happy she is with this.

1456
01:30:24,688 --> 01:30:28,906
[Running Man succeeds their mission of getting
ousted by Ji Woo without raising suspicion.]

1457
01:30:29,778 --> 01:30:33,044
<i>There are no eternal friends of enemies
on Running Man.</i>

1458
01:30:33,453 --> 01:30:36,423
[Ji Woo and Ha Ha heading
towards the final star platform.]

1459
01:30:36,424 --> 01:30:38,847
One, two, three... leg flip cross!

1460
01:30:41,523 --> 01:30:45,655
[The seven stars that used to belong
to the other members!]

1461
01:30:55,504 --> 01:30:58,691
- Look at how happy Ji Woo is right now.
- You know how good winning feels.

1462
01:30:58,692 --> 01:31:00,758
- What to do...
- What do we do?

1463
01:31:05,576 --> 01:31:09,223
[Running Man members feeling bad
for having won the mission.]

1464
01:31:09,224 --> 01:31:11,305
Okay... Ji Woo!

1465
01:31:12,190 --> 01:31:15,841
[And lastly, Ha Ha's star.]

1466
01:31:34,002 --> 01:31:37,147
[As soon as all the stars are lit up,
fireworks lights up the sky!]

1467
01:31:43,725 --> 01:31:47,949
[Beautiful fireworks to mark the
last night in year 2012.]

1468
01:31:54,553 --> 01:32:01,614
[Right behind the happy lady...
a flag drops down from the sky...]

1469
01:32:05,683 --> 01:32:08,714
[Huh?]

1470
01:32:10,061 --> 01:32:11,226
We've been watching you down here.

1471
01:32:11,227 --> 01:32:13,400
[What is that?]

1472
01:32:16,484 --> 01:32:19,775
[Still unable to comprehend this situation.]

1473
01:32:19,775 --> 01:32:22,221
- I'm a spy, Jae Suk.
- You're not a spy...

1474
01:32:23,328 --> 01:32:27,521
[Even on Choi Ji Woo's back...
'Deceive Choi Ji Woo' sticker!]

1475
01:32:27,522 --> 01:32:29,215
What the heck is that?

1476
01:32:29,216 --> 01:32:31,885
[Now finally getting what's going on.

1477
01:32:34,655 --> 01:32:37,488
[On the brink of a mental breakdown.]

1478
01:32:39,524 --> 01:32:41,948
Why is Running Man all about
deceiving people?

1479
01:32:43,373 --> 01:32:46,586
[Game with 1:7 odds where Ji Woo would've
won if she ousted anyone without a star.]

1480
01:32:46,586 --> 01:32:48,164
I'm sorry,
but there was a game like this before.

1481
01:32:48,165 --> 01:32:51,045
Traumerei...
Was that what it was called?

1482
01:32:51,224 --> 01:32:54,992
We were together during the whole race,
and with just the two of us walking around

1483
01:32:54,992 --> 01:32:57,019
and with everyone else getting ousted,
I'm sure she must've suspected something.

1484
01:32:57,020 --> 01:32:59,274
No, I didn't suspect a darn thing!

1485
01:32:59,275 --> 01:33:02,735
I really thought... I was just that good.

1486
01:33:03,436 --> 01:33:05,495
I just thought that I was that good.
Seriously.

1487
01:33:08,806 --> 01:33:13,056
[Choi Ji Woo is so beautiful!]

1488
01:33:13,406 --> 01:33:15,873
- So sweet and innocent!
- I really did think that.

1489
01:33:15,874 --> 01:33:18,997
I thought that my steps were
light as a feather.

1490
01:33:19,461 --> 01:33:23,959
[Ripping off every name tag
that crossed her way.]

1491
01:33:23,960 --> 01:33:26,389
- You were amazing at ripping them off.
- They were so fun to rip off!

1492
01:33:26,390 --> 01:33:29,528
- You really were something else.
-I could see Ji Woo getting bolstered by it.

1493
01:33:29,529 --> 01:33:31,587
- So when I asked, 'Isn't this too much?'
- She replies, 'Why?'

1494
01:33:31,588 --> 01:33:34,388
[Her one word, 'Why?' came after gaining
confidence playing the game.]

1495
01:33:34,389 --> 01:33:36,873
[Just what is the winning prize that
Running Man won?]

1496
01:33:36,874 --> 01:33:39,822
[Digital cameras!]

1497
01:33:39,823 --> 01:33:41,902
- Ji Woo, I'm so sorry!
- Ji Woo's not getting one, is she?

1498
01:33:41,903 --> 01:33:44,381
If Ji Woo had won,
would she have taken them all?

1499
01:33:44,382 --> 01:33:46,332
<i>All seven would've been
hers had she won.</i>

1500
01:33:47,124 --> 01:33:48,875
Then what about me?
I don't get one?

1501
01:33:49,361 --> 01:33:55,611
[It seems as though Ji Woo just gave the
Running Man members end of the year gifts.]

1502
01:33:55,612 --> 01:33:59,131
- Ji Woo, thanks.
- Sorry about this, but you get nothing.

1503
01:34:00,671 --> 01:34:03,822
[This is what happens due to
her unsuspecting nature...]

1504
01:34:03,823 --> 01:34:09,474
To all our faithful viewers, we sincerely
thank you for watching us throughout 2012.

1505
01:34:09,475 --> 01:34:10,934
And as for everything...

01:34:10,934 --> 01:34:13,581
all the negative things that
happened in the past year...

1507
01:34:13,582 --> 01:34:16,936
Please erase them all from your memory
as Ji Woo joined us on the show today.

1508
01:34:16,937 --> 01:34:19,986
[Erase all the unpleasant memories
from your memories- 'Jiwoo'= Erase.]

1509
01:34:19,986 --> 01:34:21,991
- Erase them completely...
- Erase them.

1510
01:34:21,992 --> 01:34:27,309
And we will work harder to bring you
more laughter in the year 2013.

1511
01:34:27,310 --> 01:34:30,253
I have become a fan of Choi Ji Woo today.
Our beautiful Choi Ji Woo.

1512
01:34:30,254 --> 01:34:32,500
[Making a fan out of all the members
with her pure and kind heart.]

1513

Please allow us to wish you well
in the year 2013.

1514
