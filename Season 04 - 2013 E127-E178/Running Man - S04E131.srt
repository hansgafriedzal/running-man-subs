00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:08,160
Since this is early in the morning...

83
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:13,580
Lee Si Young would already be training in the
boxing ring, and she's here for the race...

I have to hide for now...
First, I need to hide.

171
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:29,250
Sung Hoon and Si Young...

172
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:31,360
I have to avoid those two for now.

173
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:42,690
[The bounty is everyone's goal!
Everyone is each other's enemy!]

174
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:45,410
- You've starting now? Is this starting?
- I was just getting a taste of it for now.

175
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:47,220
- Is this you starting?
- I was just getting a taste.

176
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:49,730
- How much is he? 200 won?
- I'm only worth 200 won.

177
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:51,640
I'm only worth 200 won.
What's the point of taking me now?

178
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:54,430
- Chu Sung Hoon is here... Chu Sung Hoon.
- We're in big trouble.

179
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:57,420
But Si Young's no joke either.
You know Si Young, don't you?

180
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,130
- She's an actual fighter in Incheon.
- Really?

181
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:01,560
She's a real boxing fighter.

182
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,030
Lee Si Young is a real fighter.

183
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:05,380
- She's an acknowledged fighter.
- Really?

184
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:07,150
I told you, I saw it for myself.

185
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:10,550
- Her skills are no joke.
- Hello...

186
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:13,930
<i>Where are you going?</i>

187
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:16,620
<i>Where are you going?</i>

188
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:19,160
Si Young... it's Si Young!

189
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:21,550
[Just hearing Si Young's voice alone is
scaring the living daylights out of them!]

190
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:37,540
[The terror silently closing in on them...]

191
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,050
[Discovers Ha Ha!]

192
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:59,080
[Sung Hoon immediately starts to
chase after Ha Ha!]

193
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,360
Please!

194
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:13,630
Please! Sung Hoon... please!

195
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:15,600
Sung Hoon, it's nice to meet you!

196
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,350
It's nice to meet you!

197
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:30,220
[Easily spins him around a full circle.]

198
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,890
I'm sorry.
[Sung Hoon eliminates Ha Ha.]

199
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:37,700
[Even after being eliminated,
he's still out of sorts.]

200
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:41,500
<i>Ha Ha, out.
Ha Ha, out.</i>

201
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,780
Mommy... mommy!

202
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:49,630
<i>[Ha Ha, out.
Ha Ha, out.]</i>

203
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:56,910
What the heck...
he was right by me...

204
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:59,840
[Imagining the tragedy Ha Ha went through
by the horror he heard in his voice.]

205
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:02,630
I want my mommy!

206
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:06,580
- Ha Ha, I'm really sorry about that.
- You're so terrifying!

207
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:08,310
[First trauma of 2013.]

208
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:11,570
Thank you... oh my goodness.

209
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:17,740
[Sung Hoon wins 200 won
for eliminating Ha Ha!]

210
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:21,500
Why do you keep...
How much are you worth, Si Young?

211
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,800
- How much are you worth?
- What's the bounty on your head?

212
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:26,050
- Are you 500 won or 600 won?
- I'm worth 500 won.

213
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:27,780
I'm worth 700 won.

214
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:29,950
Your bounty is pretty high.

215
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:32,590
Can't we work together for now?

216
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,770
- Together?
- Yes.

217
00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:35,990
[Is Si Young weaker than predicted?]

218
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:38,510
Help each other for now?
I'm pretty cheap anyways.

219
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:40,130
I'm only worth 500 won,
so no use eliminating me now.

220
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:47,500
[Deciding to join forces for now
to add strength to their team.]

221
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,450
Since I'm still a man,
maybe I could be of help.

222
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:55,140
[Gary decides to team up and protect
Si Young who looks so fragile and delicate.]

223
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:56,910
Then should I lure them in and you can...

224
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:00,760
[Discovers Chu Sung Hoon!]

225
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:04,080
Wait! Wait!

226
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:05,530
Where are you going?

227
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:07,400
Hello!

228
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:10,170
We were supposed to do this together!
Don't escape by yourself!

229
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:11,610
It's nice to meet you!

230
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:15,100
[This is his powerful first greeting!]

231
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,110
[Further escaping is a worthless effort!]

232
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:21,080
Si Young, make your escape!

233
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,830
Run for it, Si Young!
Hurry!

234
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:26,460
Don't do this!
I told you to run!

235
00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:32,910
[Si Young eliminates Gary's name tag!]

236
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,250
500 won.

237
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:37,540
- I'll save the ladies for later.
- Thank you!

238
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:40,970
I was told...

239
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:43,460
that a man needs to be careful
about the woman he meets.

240
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:46,550
<i>Gary, out!
Gary, out!</i>

241
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:49,520
[Upset about being fooled into thinking
that she was a frail woman.]

242
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,700
But at least my pride isn't wounded.

243
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,740
Since I was ousted by Lee Si Young...

244
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:56,750
[Si Young wins 500 won for
eliminating Gary!]

245
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:06,290
Gary, are you okay?

246
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:07,840
This is no joke, is it?

247
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:10,750
[The two kids running into each other
on their way to jail.]

248
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:15,330
- Hello.
- Hello, Sung Hoon.

249
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,820
- It's nice to meet you.
- Allow me to formally say hello.

250
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:19,680
May I have the honor of shaking
your hand?

251
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:24,580
He's like a dinosaur!

252
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:28,840
What happened to your arm?
You look like the incredible hulk.

253
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:32,610
- You sleeves are all ripped off.
- The sleeves were too small.

254
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:35,130
- You ripped them off?
- I cut them off.

255
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:37,750
[It would be like an
extra-large to these two...]

256
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:41,570
I can't believe how big he is.
Sung Hoon, please take care of Jong Kook!

257
00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:45,020
Let him anticipate my arrival.

258
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:46,490
Jong Kook!

259
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:51,390
<i>Jong Kook!</i>

260
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,710
Wow... I think he's very
determined today.

261
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,110
[The wild beast having loosened up
his limbs.]

262
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:06,650
[Finally starts the real hunt!]

263
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:11,890
[Discovers the fighter!]

264
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:13,750
- Hello!
- What are you doing!

265
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:17,120
[Starts the chase after
politely greeting him first!]

266
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,320
Hello!

267
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:26,310
How was your new year?
I hope it was full of good fortune!

268
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:35,130
[Escaped from the fourth floor down
to the first floor in a span of one breath!]

269
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:36,940
[A dead end!]

270
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:38,330
Sung Hoon...

271
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:44,570
[Greeting each other first since they
haven't seen each other in a long time.]

272
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:46,900
[Grasshopper's life in danger!]

273
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:52,080
I'll let you live just this once.

274
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:55,130
- Thank you... thank you, Sung Hoon.
- I'll see you later.

275
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:04,700
[Jae Suk able to live for a little while
longer thanks to Sung Hoon's generosity.]

276
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,030
Sung Hoon... he really is no joke.

277
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:11,710
- Who? Who are you talking about?
- Sung Hoon!

278
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,520
What do we do, Jae Suk?

279
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,950
Sung Hoon wasn't giving me
a break earlier.

280
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:21,100
When Sung Hoon grabbed me
by my arms earlier...

281
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,450
he realized I'm not your
average opponent.

282
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:27,100
[Then he's saying Sung Hoon
ran away from him earlier?]

283
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:30,160
- One fighter recognized another.
- Then Jae Suk...

284
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,100
- You're going to go up against him?
- Don't worry about it.

285
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:33,500
Jae Suk, are you serious?

286
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:37,120
[The scent of Sung Hoon's cologne is...]

287
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,380
You really do have the nose
of a bloodhound!

288
00:18:41,210 --> 00:18:43,480
[I'm positive he's nearby...]

289
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:53,540
[He really is!]

290
00:18:56,410 --> 00:18:59,940
[He was just saying that he was going to
stand up to him if he saw him again...]

291
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,150
Who was it?

292
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:08,360
[Giraffe escapes in their direction too!]

293
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:11,300
[One person after another collapsing onto
the ground and saying they can't handle it.]

294
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:13,310
He's up on the sixth floor.

295
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:16,300
- Chu Sung Hoon and Lee Si Young...
- Jae Suk said Sung Hoon...

296
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:20,560
realized after grabbing him by the arms that
he's a frightening opponent and ran from him.

297
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,960
[Jae Suk starts to talk the game again after
having escaped from him for the second time.]

298
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,120
And then he just let me go.
He was taken aback by me.

299
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,450
He was basically saying that he wasn't
ready to take me on yet.

300
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:29,410
[How about you thanking him for
letting you live just minute ago?]

301
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:33,520
I hear someone coughing.
I think that's Sung Hoon again.

302
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:36,560
[But you said you could take him on and
beat him if you went up against him...]

303
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,810
[Si Young is right next to them!]

304
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:51,370
[Going somewhere?]

305
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:57,820
[The herbivores caught in total chaos!]

306
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:04,910
Ji Hyo... I can't live like this!

307
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:11,600
[Jae Suk and Ji Hyo having
breathlessly escaped.]

308
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,970
I told you, didn't I?
That I can smell Sung Hoon's scent?

309
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:16,580
He has a scent to him?

310
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:18,050
Like I always say...

311
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:24,420
The one that falls behind from the pack is
the one that gets eliminated in Serengeti.

312
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:27,400
Kwang Soo...

313
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:32,130
[The giraffe that fell behind
the rest of his herd.]

314
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:37,420
[Making his closing argument
to the fighter.]

315
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:39,590
You know that I'm not threat to you.

316
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:42,550
If I give you a break now,
it'll be my third time doing it.

317
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,310
I've already let two people go.

318
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:48,010
There's a Korean proverb that says,
'Best out of three'.

319
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:51,690
You sure do talk a lot.

320
00:20:56,140 --> 00:21:00,020
[Oh look... there's the Giraffe...]

321
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:03,610
In that case...

322
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:04,790
[Pretending not to see her.]

323
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,570
Wait!

324
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:10,530
[Si Young eliminates the Giraffe!]

325
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:22,010
- She's really good... she's really good.
- Did you purposely not say anything to me?

326
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:23,780
No, I didn't see her either.

327
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:25,510
She totally snuck up on us!

328
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:28,610
[Giraffe, out! Kwang Soo's 500 won
bounty goes to Si Young!]

329
00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:31,810
<i>[Lee Kwang Soo, out.
Lee Kwang Soo, out!]</i>

330
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:33,800
I told you, the one who falls behind
the herd is the one who dies.

331
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:37,410
[The chances are slim if one falls behind
their herbivore herd...]

332
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:46,880
[There he is again! The fighter!]

333
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,250
<i>Wait... Jae Suk!</i>

334
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:53,380
It's Sung Hoon again!
Hey! It's Sung Hoon!

335
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:55,690
Just how many
Chu Sung Hoon's are there?

336
00:21:58,010 --> 00:22:00,750
[Ji Hyo barely escapes to her safety!]

337
00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:05,320
And this way is Lee Si Young!

338
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:07,110
[A total dilemma!]

339
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:19,580
[Speeds up and catches him
within seconds.]

340
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:21,850
Why are you so strong?

341
00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:23,680
[With a shockingly powerful grip...]

342
00:22:26,050 --> 00:22:27,760
How much are you worth?

343
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:32,880
You... you haven't seen me in forever...

344
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:34,560
And the first thing you can say to me is,
'How much are you worth'?

345
00:22:34,570 --> 00:22:36,400
[That's the first thing she says to him after
not having seem him in forever?]

346
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:39,200
<i>[Yoo Jae Suk, out!
Yoo Jae Suk, out!]</i>

347
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,070
It looks like everyone that should be
in jail will be here soon.

348
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:43,450
Of course, the sooner
they all get here, the better.

349
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:45,840
[But he still lasted longer
than expected...]

350
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:51,120
[Discovers Big-nosed Brother in hiding.]

351
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,040
- I used to practice judo.
- Judo?

352
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:57,300
[Easily takes over him by using the
judo skills his body is so used to.]

353
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,440
[Wins Suk Jin's bounty of 100 won!]

354
00:23:05,670 --> 00:23:08,030
[Discovers Ace Ji Hyo!]

355
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:12,330
[Even though he's weak
when it comes to women...]

356
00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:15,520
[He still knows to trip them over
with his foot!]

357
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:21,590
[Even Ace Ji Hyo is a piece of cake!]

358
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:23,840
- Good luck with the rest.
- Wait. Give me my 700 won.

359
00:23:24,410 --> 00:23:28,190
[Win's Ji Hyo's bounty of 700 won!]

360
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:39,130
<i>[Song Ji Hyo, out!
Song Ji Hyo, out!]</i>

361
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:42,000
[Now...]

362
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,380
[It's time for me to step up...]

363
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:49,160
[I don't care how little the bounty is!]

364
00:23:54,150 --> 00:24:00,450
[Now... there are only two
left remaining...]

365
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,180
- Sung Hoon!
- Hello.

366
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:14,690
It really has been a long time.

367
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:18,080
Why did you come on the show?

368
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,430
[A wild beast vs. A wild beast.]

369
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,680
How do you want to do this?

370
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,700
What do you mean,
how do I want to do this?

371
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:29,880
This is... Sung Hoon...

372
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:33,040
What are you doing?
Are you trying to fight me or something?

373
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:35,890
- That's what you do in the fighting ring!
- This is how I loosen up before I compete.

374
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:39,270
- Why are you being like this, Sung Hoon?
- You said I'm ignorant about my moves.

375
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:43,110
There's a rumor going around about you
saying that I'm ignorant about my moves!

376
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:45,610
- Who said that?
- I read it on Naver.

377
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:51,040
You can't believe everything
you read on Naver.

378
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,250
What are you doing?
What's wrong with you?

379
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:00,860
Why are you doing that?
Seriously?

380
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:07,040
[An unavoidable fateful showdown.]

381
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:10,120
- This is unavoidable, so let's just...
- I know, so let's do this.

382
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:13,830
[The fighter starting off
with light footwork.]

383
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:17,710
[Getting into the fighting stance!]

384
00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:19,300
- Give me some time to prepare!
- What time?

385
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,670
[Sensing an opportunity,
Si Young makes her move.]

386
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:26,320
[A sandwich attack on Jong Kook?]

387
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,200
[Mr. Capable in extreme danger!]

388
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,450
- Si Young, why are you doing this to me?
- Si Young...

389
00:25:32,930 --> 00:25:34,960
Why... why are you doing this?

390
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,480
Why are you doing this to me, Si Young?

391
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:40,010
[His leg?]

392
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,070
[Mr. Capable escapes a very close call!]

393
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:51,170
I think it's now time for us
to see this through.

394
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:58,050
[Si Young in a defense mode with
her back firmly attached to the wall.]

395
00:26:02,290 --> 00:26:05,710
[After moving this way and that way,
Sung Hoon suddenly grabs Si Young?]

396
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:07,660
No!

397
00:26:10,790 --> 00:26:13,270
[Grabs her within a blink of an eye!]

398
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:16,340
[Si Young - out!]

399
00:26:17,170 --> 00:26:20,850
[Rule: The bounty she's collected
so far is no longer valid!]

400
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:26,880
[Sticks it back on?]

401
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,080
What are you doing?

402
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:31,390
Is it back on?

403
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:33,620
- Lee Si Young, out.
- No!

404
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:35,210
<i>[Lee Si Young, out!]</i>

405
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,690
[Wins Si Young's bounty of 700 won!]

406
00:26:38,690 --> 00:26:40,310
Wow... 700 won?

407
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:44,850
Your bounty is worth 800 won, right?

408
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:52,000
[Now without having to worry
about anyone else...]

409
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,470
[It's now down to the two of them!]

410
00:27:00,010 --> 00:27:02,920
[The real fight begins now!]

411
00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:05,840
- You're my senior on this show.
- That's true.

412
00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:10,350
[Anxiousness multiplied a hundred fold!
A battle of will!]

413
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:13,490
[Mr. Capable attacks first!]

414
00:27:13,490 --> 00:27:15,020
[As predicted, doesn't
work too easily on Sung Hoon!]

415
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:20,070
[No words are exchanged.
Just the sound of their labored breathing.]

416
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:25,170
- Sorry!
- I'm fine.

417
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,310
This is fun!

418
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:34,100
How much do you work out?
Look at your arms!

419
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:35,940
- Your arms are the same.
- No, they're not!

420
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:40,340
[Mr. Capable, a rather equal opponent!]

421
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:44,840
Just give me my 800 won!

422
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:47,760
- Sung Hoon... Sung Hoon!
- I said, I want my 800 won!

423
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,430
- Why are you getting so worked up?
- I want my 800 won!

424
00:27:55,810 --> 00:27:57,950
[Sung Hoon deflects by twisting his body!]

425
00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:01,470
[Mr. Capable's repeated attack!]

426
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:03,950
[And Sung Hoon deflects it again!]

427
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:08,670
- What was that the last time...
- Family Outing?

428
00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:10,560
You've gotten much stronger since then.

429
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:15,210
- We were just trying to be funny then.
- I know, but you're stronger now.

430
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:16,810
He's totally different!

431
00:28:18,010 --> 00:28:20,260
[Each saying flattering words to
each other to prolong the rest period.]

432
00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:22,150
You're very agile and quick.

433
00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:24,590
- How old are you?
- I'm a year younger than you are.

434
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,620
[A perfectly matched pair of fighters'
battle of strength!]

435
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:32,120
[This is a real battle between the masters!]

436
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:45,920
This is really...

437
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:50,320
[Mr. Capable escapes with
an impressive reflex!]

438
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:54,480
[The two fighting with all their sincerity.]

439
00:29:00,770 --> 00:29:02,150
No, that's fine.

440
00:29:02,150 --> 00:29:03,820
Just don't rail me.

441
00:29:05,490 --> 00:29:06,950
Sorry, Sung Hoon!

442
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:15,690
[Huh? Was he about to go in
for a knee kick?]

443
00:29:17,270 --> 00:29:21,300
[The fiercest showdown
in the history of Running Man!]

444
00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:24,460
[Just who will be the victor?]

445
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:42,340
[Sung Hoon grabs onto his sleeve
with his unbelievable strength!]

446
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:45,590
[Mr. Capable caught in a snare
and unable to move!]

447
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:48,010
[Wow! Sung Hoon's not letting go
of his grip on Jong Kook's clothes!]

448
00:30:00,930 --> 00:30:05,500
[He has his hand on the name tag!]

449
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:13,740
[Sung Hoon succeeds in eliminating
Jong Kook!]

450
00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:18,160
Ah... seriously!

451
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:22,260
[Wins Jong Kook's bounty of 800 won!]

452
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:30,890
[Chu Sung Hoon wins!
Wins a total bounty of 2,500 won!]

453
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:37,510
- Why does he look like that?
- I'm glad! You deserve it!

454
00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:39,540
[Totally battered and mangled.]

455
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:42,210
<i>- Look at you... you deserve it!
- Such a sweet payback.</i>

456
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:44,780
<i>Now what about the bounty?</i>

457
00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:48,180
[Hands out the bounty won to the winner.]

458
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:51,830
<i>This money will become of
great use to you.</i>

459
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:54,580
- How is that going to become useful?
- It literally is 2,500 won in change?

460
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:57,420
<i>I will explain today's race to all of you.</i>

461
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:00,610
<i>Today's race is,
The Lord of Ddak-ji.</i>

462
00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:03,950
[The Lord of Ddak-ji.]

463
00:31:03,950 --> 00:31:06,750
Yes! You just said, Ddak-ji, right?

464
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:09,040
There are too many leaders
in Ddak-ji that are emerging lately...

465
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,500
But I'm the master king.

466
00:31:11,610 --> 00:31:15,440
[Last Chuseok, a huge reverse in the role!
The new ultimate Lord of Ddak-ji!]

467
00:31:15,730 --> 00:31:18,260
<i>You will be divided into three teams
to play the race today.</i>

468
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:23,460
<i>Each team will be able to win money for
their Ddak-ji's by passing their missions.</i>

469
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:27,860
[Purchase their Ddak-ji's by using
all the money that they have earned...]

470
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:33,620
[And determine who the Lord of Ddak-ji is
by playing a round of Ddak-ji competition.]

471
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:39,430
<i>Sung Hoon,
have you ever played Ddak-ji before?</i>

472
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:40,950
<i>Do you even know what a Ddak-ji is?</i>

473
00:31:40,950 --> 00:31:42,860
<i>It's settled then!
We don't even need to worry.</i>

474
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:45,940
<i>- All he has is money. 2,500 won.
- He can get a good Ddak-ji though.</i>

475
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:49,900
<i>And the winner of the name tag elimination
is given the right to choose his own team.</i>

476
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:52,170
<i>Chu Sung Hoon can make up the team
however he likes.</i>

477
00:31:52,170 --> 00:31:53,610
- Take the Easy Brothers...
- Ha Ha.

478
00:31:55,230 --> 00:31:57,410
- Thank you, Sung Hoon!
- Him? Are you serious?

479
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:02,970
Once my brother,
you'll always be my brother!

480
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:07,940
I feel so bad for ousting him so quickly
when we started the game...

481
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:11,840
No, Sung Hoon. I'm rather grateful to you
for straightening out my normally bad back!

482
00:32:14,030 --> 00:32:15,170
<i>Thank you, Brother!</i>

483
00:32:15,170 --> 00:32:17,690
He really is...

484
00:32:17,690 --> 00:32:20,110
He's a total traitor though.

485
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:21,110
And for my other member...

486
00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:23,500
[And his other team member is...]

487
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:24,580
Yoo Jae Suk.

488
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:25,780
[And his other choice is, Yoo Jae Suk.]

489
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:28,060
[Immediately bows down.]

490
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:33,210
[Birth of another traitor?]

491
00:32:33,210 --> 00:32:35,910
- Why are you taking him?
- Sung Hoon...

492
00:32:35,910 --> 00:32:38,500
[Did he just refer to Sung Hoon
as his older brother?]

493
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:41,590
What did you say?
Come on, now!

494
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:44,840
[You definitely said, 'My big brother!'...]

495
00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:48,180
Who cares if I called him that?
Why is it important what I call him?

496
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:49,750
- Sung Hoon...
- Yes?

497
00:32:50,130 --> 00:32:52,160
We're not traitors!

498
00:33:03,170 --> 00:33:06,660
[The rising sun coming to find them after
their rousing round of the Bounty Hunt game.]

499

<i>- What is this?
- What could that be?</i>

500
00:33:10,210 --> 00:33:12,920
[What is their next mission after
their first shocking mission of the day?]

501
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:16,860
[A seat cushion with each of
their names written on it?]

502
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:18,690
Why am I seated next to him?

503
00:33:18,690 --> 00:33:20,920
[Annoyed with being seated
next to Sung Hoon?]

504
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:24,200
Si Young... fighting!

505
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:29,670
[Starting to break out the boxing jokes
in front of Si Young, the boxer?]

506
00:33:34,690 --> 00:33:37,160
<i>This is really fun.
Shadow boxing is a lot of fun.</i>

507
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,940
[The birth of a new boxing couple gag.]

508
00:33:43,610 --> 00:33:46,020
- Don't do it!
- I haven't see you joke like that in a while.

509
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:52,240
<i>It's time for you to do the missions with
your team to win money to buy your Ddak-ji's.</i>

510
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:55,600
<i>Your first mission is...
Floor cushion quiz.</i>

511
00:33:56,630 --> 00:33:59,990
<i>You have to roll over on your seats
up to the front</i>

512
00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:02,770
<i>and be the first to place
the cushion on top of the coffee table</i>

513
00:34:03,190 --> 00:34:05,790
<i>to gain the chance to
answer the question being asked.</i>

514
00:34:05,790 --> 00:34:09,320
<i>Once the person answer a question correctly,
that person can now step out of the quiz.</i>

515
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:14,490
<i>The first team to answer the questions
correctly will be the winner.</i>

516
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,480
- Suk Jin, you're good at this.
- Fighting.

517
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:20,220
[A great opportunity for
the weaker players!]

518
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:21,620
This is your best chance.

519
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:23,120
You have to do a good job.

520
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:26,230
You have to watch out for Si Young.
She may accidentally knock you out.

521
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:27,880
[Need to be careful of
Si Young's boxer moves.]

522
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,650
No, I'll never do that.

523
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:32,230
[Really?]

524
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:33,880
- Here comes your first question.
- Okay.

525
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:35,420
[First question.]

526
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:36,680
<i>In the past...</i>

527
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:41,410
<i>It was said that if you bought this on the
night of New Year's Eve, you'd have good luck.</i>

528
00:34:44,130 --> 00:34:45,970
[A slugfest!]

529
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:52,710
[Screams heard from all directions.]

530
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:55,470
<i>The cushion... the cushion!
You have to get it on the table!</i>

531
00:34:56,750 --> 00:34:59,330
[Si Young was faster!]

532
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:00,870
- What is her deal?
- Do you know the answer?

533
00:35:00,870 --> 00:35:02,580
Is she allowed to hit people
with her elbow?

534
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,610
How could you...

535
00:35:06,010 --> 00:35:09,540
- Si Young, don't you think that was harsh?
- What is it? What's the answer?

536
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:11,130
[Tell me...]

537
00:35:11,790 --> 00:35:14,090
- What's your answer?
- You can't ask him for the answer!

538
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:18,890
- Five, four, three, two...
- The money pouch.

539
00:35:19,470 --> 00:35:21,230
<i>- That's right!
- No, that's not it.</i>

540
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:22,260
<i>Please go back to your places.</i>

541
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:24,070
It's a silk pouch, isn't it?
A silk pouch?

542
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,950
Si Young was so forceful
making her way up to the front.

543
00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:29,460
[Punching past people is just a given?]

544
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:31,010
<i>On the night of New Year's Eve...</i>

545
00:35:31,010 --> 00:35:33,370
<i>it was said that if you bought this,
it would bring you good fortune.</i>

546
00:35:33,370 --> 00:35:35,360
<i>What is this tool which can
be used for rice?</i>

547
00:35:42,650 --> 00:35:45,400
[A given punch.]

548
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,870
Lee Si Young!

549
00:35:48,310 --> 00:35:50,120
[A fierce battle of the cushions.]

550
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:53,140
[Sung Hoon gets to it first!]

551
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:55,540
- Chu Sung Hoon. It was Chu Sung Hoon.
- But I bet he doesn't know the answer.

552
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:56,630
[What will Sung Hoon's answer be?]

553
00:35:56,630 --> 00:35:57,640
<i>Your answer, Chu Sung Hoon?</i>

554
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:59,220
Crayons.

555
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:03,900
[The tool used for the rice is crayons?]

556
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:13,740
[Did the Giraffe do something to
deserve getting hit?]

557
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:15,340
[You...]

558
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:17,800
[Right before the start...]

559
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:21,550
- Crayons... it's crayons.
- Crayons?

560
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:24,230
Ah... crayons.

561
00:36:26,210 --> 00:36:29,380
[Playing a joke on Sung Hoon...
the fearless Giraffe...]

562
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:32,740
<i>You can start as soon as
I sound my whistle.</i>

563
00:36:33,350 --> 00:36:34,970
What's the answer?

564
00:36:36,370 --> 00:36:38,150
[Asking so innocently with
her sweet face...]

565
00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:39,740
Okay, I know the answer.

566
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:41,770
[It seems as though a few know
what the answer is.]

567
00:36:47,390 --> 00:36:50,190
[Ha Ha gets to it first by
the split of his hair!]

568
00:36:50,190 --> 00:36:51,290
- Okay!
- Ha Ha!

569
00:36:51,290 --> 00:36:53,470
- Bokjori! (Rice sieve)
- Yeah. That's the answer!

570
00:36:53,470 --> 00:36:55,530
- Rice sieve!
- No... that can't be the answer!

571
00:36:55,530 --> 00:36:57,170
<i>- That's not the correct answer.
- That can't be the answer.</i>

572
00:36:57,170 --> 00:36:58,500
<i>Correct answer.</i>

573
00:36:58,500 --> 00:36:59,840
[Correct answer.]

574
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,920
- It's the rice sieve!
- Is that really the answer?

575
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,710
- Rice sieve!
- Excuse me...

576
00:37:03,710 --> 00:37:06,840
It's Bokjori, right?
But he said, Bokjjori.

577
00:37:07,330 --> 00:37:10,280
[Wha... what?]

578
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:14,030
[Earnestly protesting the way
he pronounced the word.]

579
00:37:14,030 --> 00:37:15,240
- You said we had to say it right.
- Bokjori.

580
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:16,920
- He's correct.
- That's not how he said it!

581
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:19,150
He said, 'Bokjjori'.

582
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:22,890
- What he said was right.
- What?

583
00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:26,830
But if you're to enunciate each syllable,
it should be 'Bok-jo-ri'.

584
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:27,990
She's saying that he pronounced it wrong.

585
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,100
Listen, PD...

586
00:37:30,410 --> 00:37:33,340
Can you do penalize Si Young
for her cheating?

587
00:37:33,350 --> 00:37:35,480
Kwang Soo and I right now...
She's keeps punching us out!

588
00:37:36,790 --> 00:37:38,460
[Another victim.]

589
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:39,860
<i>Don't you think she's being
too rough?</i>

590
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:42,620
[Jae Suk and Kwang Soo,
not even being able to get a real start.]

591
00:37:44,610 --> 00:37:47,060
I can maybe understand the arm pulling,
but look at him over here.

592
00:37:47,450 --> 00:37:50,080
Look at how red our necks are!

593
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:52,250
She grabbed me by the neck like this
so that I won't be able to move!

594
00:37:52,250 --> 00:37:54,380
[Is that how she grabbed the neck?]

595
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:56,680
- No, I didn't...
- You have to do something about her!

596
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:58,990
I'm sorry, but she did it to help you
improve your blood circulation.

597
00:37:58,990 --> 00:38:00,110
- Is that right?
- Yes!

598
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:02,010
- Really? Fine, fine!
- It's for the sake for your own health.

599
00:38:02,770 --> 00:38:04,910
[Come on, let's just play...]

600
00:38:04,910 --> 00:38:06,370
[Blue Team's Ha Ha succeeds!]

601
00:38:06,370 --> 00:38:08,980
Didn't I say the silk pouch in the beginning?

602
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:12,000
- Yes.
- But I was thinking the sieve when I said it.

603
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,940
- I was thinking the sieve...
- That's what you may have thought...

604
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:18,040
If she argues that's what she was thinking,
how is this game going to be played?

605
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:20,180
That's why I'm acknowledging that
my answer was wrong.

606
00:38:20,930 --> 00:38:24,290
I appreciate you acknowledging you were
wrong, but Kwang Soo and I...

607
00:38:24,290 --> 00:38:27,140
It's not that we're being slow,
but we can't even get started on our way.

608
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:29,930
But you said it in the beginning that it was
okay for us to shove people out of our way?

609
00:38:29,930 --> 00:38:31,750
<i>- Yes, that doesn't matter.
- That's how the game is played.</i>

610
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:34,290
- But she's the only one doing the hitting.
- Hit me, you can hit me.

611
00:38:34,290 --> 00:38:36,280
[Huh?]
Hit me, you can hit me.

612
00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:38,980
Hit me.
Don't be uncomfortable, and just hit me.

613
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:41,780
[What? Be comfortable and hit you?]

614
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:44,370
But that's the rule of the game.
Just hit and shove me out of the way.

615
00:38:44,370 --> 00:38:47,180
- But how can we shove and hit you?
- It's okay!

616
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:48,710
- Really, it's okay!
- Isn't this all too much?

617
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:51,110
You can seriously just shove me off!
It really is fine!

618
00:38:51,110 --> 00:38:53,020
<i>I can't believe she's telling us
to shove her out of the way!</i>

619
00:38:53,510 --> 00:38:55,430
<i>Okay, everyone...
here's your next question.</i>

620
00:38:55,670 --> 00:38:57,930
<i>On New Year's day...</i>

621
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:00,760
[Already?]

622
00:39:02,870 --> 00:39:04,000
Lee Si Young.

623
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,290
Board jumping.

624
00:39:08,370 --> 00:39:09,940
<i>Don't you do that during Chuseok?</i>

625
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:13,240
Isn't what we're doing right now
board jumping?

626
00:39:21,210 --> 00:39:22,880
[Gary's morning show?]

627
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:27,750
She's jumping the board over here
and he's accepting her jumps.

628
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:29,680
I went because I thought of something.

629
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:31,360
Go ahead then.

630
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:34,790
[What is the answer Gary has thought of
before even hearing out the full question?]

631
00:39:34,790 --> 00:39:36,160
- Answer the question and make us laugh
- Kang Gary.

632
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:37,640
Yut game.
(Stick throwing game.)

633
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:39,430
- Yut game.
- Seriously?

634
00:39:39,430 --> 00:39:41,160
[Could it be?]

635
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,110
<i>Okay, here's the question.</i>

636
00:39:45,110 --> 00:39:47,850
[She's coming out again?]

637
00:39:47,850 --> 00:39:49,370

Hwa-to.
(Korean card game.)

640
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:55,450
[What?]

641
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,400
What do you mean, Hwa-to?

642
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:02,640
That's not a traditional game
to be playing on New Year's day!

643
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:07,000
<i>One of the games that's played on
New Year's Day...</i>

644
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:13,190
<i>Depending on how it's played, it can
be called throwing, hound dog, or loose.</i>

645
00:40:13,190 --> 00:40:14,750
Oh loose!

646
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:19,630
You're out way too far.
Why do you keep fidgeting like that?

647
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:22,910
[Sung Hoon continuously trying to
figure out his starting position.]

648
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,400
<i>Three, two, one!</i>

649

Jaegi kick!

655
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:40,480
Wait, it's that thing.

656
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,640
[Huh?]

657
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:43,610
What is that thing? That...

658
00:40:44,350 --> 00:40:45,570
What?

659
00:40:45,570 --> 00:40:47,060
If you can't remember what it is,
just go back to your seat!

660
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:49,500
You know that thing...
the thing that starts with 'Chul'...

661
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:52,300
[The word that starts with 'Chul'?]

662
00:40:53,290 --> 00:41:00,270
Jaegi Kick!
J-a-e-g-i, K-i-c-k. Right?

663
00:41:00,270 --> 00:41:01,560
Why do we have to put up with this?

664
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:04,900
[Correctly spelling out 'Jaegi kick'.]

665
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:08,260
[Ji Hyo answers correctly!]

666
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:11,430
<i>Si Young, you did good.</i>

667
00:41:11,430 --> 00:41:13,100
What was she talking about,
the word that starts with 'Chul'?

668
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,450
The word that starts with 'Chul'...

669
00:41:16,750 --> 00:41:20,360
I'm sorry, but Sung Hoon doesn't
know any of these questions.

670
00:41:20,370 --> 00:41:22,330
He doesn't know anything but he just
keeps getting in my way.

671
00:41:22,330 --> 00:41:24,050
You have to do something about him.

672
00:41:24,050 --> 00:41:25,890
I'm doing good right now.

673
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:29,670
<i>This question has to do with food.</i>

674
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31,080
[Red Team's Jong Kook also answers
a question correctly and passes.]

675
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:35,660
<i>Another name for this food is,
'Chumsaebyung'.</i>

676
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:37,190
<i>What dish is this referring to?</i>

677
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:40,210
[Does Si Young even know what the answer
is as she's making her way up front?]

678
00:41:40,210 --> 00:41:41,750
You're asking what the meaning is?

679
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:44,330
<i>She needs to be humiliated once...</i>

680
00:41:44,330 --> 00:41:47,500
<i>What is the dish that's at times
referred to as, 'Chumsaebyung'?</i>

681
00:41:47,970 --> 00:41:50,140
That... what was it called again?
Gyungdan!

682
00:41:50,150 --> 00:41:52,180
[Huh? Gyungdan?]

683
00:41:53,090 --> 00:41:55,210
I know you're my teammate,
but you're really something else.

684
00:41:57,970 --> 00:42:00,160
Is that the whole question?
Chumsaebyung?

685
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:05,810
<i>What is this dish that is at times called
'Chumsaebyung'? I'll give you a hint.</i>

686
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:09,180
<i>It's a New Year's food.
One, two, three!</i>

687
00:42:11,950 --> 00:42:13,890
[Oh... Gary!]

688
00:42:13,890 --> 00:42:14,940
<i>Kang Gary.</i>

689
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:16,580
Rice cake soup.
(Dduk guk)

690
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:19,810
Rice cake soup.
(Dduk guk)

691
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:23,500
Double 'D' to the 'U'...

692
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:26,920
[Precisely spelling out the words.]

693
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:29,210
[Correct answer.]

694
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:33,290
- It was rice cake soup?
- It's the rice cake soup.

695
00:42:33,290 --> 00:42:34,680
- You're the only one who needs to pass now.
- Kwang Soo!

696
00:42:35,270 --> 00:42:36,940
<i>This question is...</i>

697
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:40,750
<i>When you bow down to your parents
on New Year's Day...</i>

698
00:42:41,730 --> 00:42:45,040
<i>which hand is placed on top
for the daughters?</i>

699
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:49,900
[Jae Suk? What got into him?]

700
00:42:50,290 --> 00:42:51,870
- It's a fifty-fifty chance.
- The left hand.

701
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:55,620
<i>Which number with the left hand?</i>

702
00:42:55,620 --> 00:42:57,600
[Huh?]

703
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:59,900
- What is that supposed to mean?
- This is good!

704
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:01,750
- Nice going!
- What is that supposed to mean?

705
00:43:02,070 --> 00:43:03,560
Second left hand?

706
00:43:05,980 --> 00:43:08,930
<i>It's the second right foot.
You answered incorrectly.</i>

707
00:43:09,590 --> 00:43:11,560
<i>Sung Hoon, just guess the number.</i>

708
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:13,050
- Yeah, just guess it!
- Sung Hoon!

709
00:43:13,050 --> 00:43:17,230
<i>Which hand does the daughter place on top
when she bows down to her parents?</i>

710
00:43:18,870 --> 00:43:20,700
Wait! Can he do this?

711
00:43:21,050 --> 00:43:22,380
Wait!

712
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:24,350
[Utter chaos]

713
00:43:25,090 --> 00:43:26,920
[Si Young's breakthrough
that knows no end.]

714
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:28,300
Si Young doesn't care about anything.

715
00:43:28,310 --> 00:43:29,570
Third left hand.

716
00:43:29,570 --> 00:43:31,310
<i>Three times with the left hand?</i>

717
00:43:31,530 --> 00:43:33,880
<i>Third left foot.</i>

718
00:43:34,310 --> 00:43:37,050
- Do you have it written down there?
- Yes, we have it written down.

719
00:43:37,730 --> 00:43:40,940
[Maybe it's not the left hand
after all...]

720
00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:42,970
Kwang Soo, we just need you to pass.

721
00:43:42,970 --> 00:43:46,240
<i>Three, two, one!</i>

722
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:48,510
Si Young... Si Young!

723
00:43:49,170 --> 00:43:50,900
Si Young! Get it!

724
00:43:54,690 --> 00:43:56,810
[Kwang Soo's cushion having
made it through the melee.]

725
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:58,920
<i>Your answer?</i>

726
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:00,860
The fourth right hand.

727
00:44:01,110 --> 00:44:04,290
<i>Fourth.... fourth right arm.</i>

728
00:44:04,290 --> 00:44:06,180
[The fourth one is the right arm.]

729
00:44:06,940 --> 00:44:08,520
Is this how you're supposed to
bow down?

730
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:12,140
[I'm sure that's not how it's done...]

731
00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:14,080
It's the same thing with the right foot.

732
00:44:17,380 --> 00:44:19,140
- Sung Hoon, stop moving around on it!
- He broke it.

733
00:44:19,140 --> 00:44:22,000
[No thanks to Sung Hoon,
the chair is now damaged and broken.]

734
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,810
Look at how casually you're just
taking over my seat.

735
00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:28,670
How many chairs are you
going to break?

736
00:44:30,530 --> 00:44:31,890
<i>- Are you ready?
- Yes.</i>

737
00:44:32,770 --> 00:44:35,250
[Which number is the right hand?]

738
00:44:37,010 --> 00:44:38,150
[Jae Suk blocks Kwang Soo's cushion?]

739
00:44:38,150 --> 00:44:40,180
[And immediately swipes Si Young's
cushion out of his way?]

740
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:41,250
Mine! My cushion!

741
00:44:41,990 --> 00:44:44,050
[Kwang Soo's cushion hits the ledge
and bounces off the table...]

742
00:44:44,050 --> 00:44:45,480
[And Jae Suk pushes it out of the way.]

743
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:47,930
[And Si Young's cushion immediately
follows by flying onto the table.]

744
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:51,050
[Si Young's chance!]

745
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:55,680
<i>I can't acknowledge it when it's
shoved out of the way with the hand.</i>

746
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:56,810
<i>Which number did we get up to?</i>

747
00:44:56,810 --> 00:44:58,900
- And your answer is?
- Number six with the right hand.

748
00:44:59,660 --> 00:45:03,260
- Number six with the right hand.
- It's not six! We already said six.

749
00:45:03,270 --> 00:45:04,450
[We already did six?]

750
00:45:04,450 --> 00:45:06,980
- We've already gone up to number six.
- Aren't you on my team?

751
00:45:08,030 --> 00:45:10,010
I'm letting you know that
we've already said that earlier.

752
00:45:10,550 --> 00:45:14,190
- He already said number six earlier.
- No, he didn't!

753
00:45:14,190 --> 00:45:16,110
- No, he didn't!
- Why are you getting angry?

754
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:18,910
I was just telling her we
already said six.

755
00:45:18,910 --> 00:45:22,830
<i>I'll ignore what's been said so far,
and I'll accept what Si Young says now.</i>

756
00:45:22,830 --> 00:45:25,630
- Five, four, three...
- Number six, right hand.

757
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:27,250
Number six, right hand!

758
00:45:27,250 --> 00:45:29,140
We told you, six has been said!

759
00:45:29,140 --> 00:45:30,520
[Wasn't six already said?]

760
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:32,240
[What? Correct answer!]

761
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:35,530
<i>- I guess number six wasn't said?
- I thought six was already said!</i>

762
00:45:36,650 --> 00:45:38,500
<i>That's the correct answer.</i>

763
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:39,810
Really?

764
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:42,690
- Six wasn't said?
- Wow, that's awesome.

765
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:44,910
- Six wasn't said.
- Really?

766
00:45:44,910 --> 00:45:48,660
<i>Okay, first place has been determined.
First place goes to the Red Team.</i>

767
00:45:48,670 --> 00:45:50,140
[Red Team takes first place in
the quiz game!]

768
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:53,510
- Here's your question.
- Do a better job, Kwang Soo!

769
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:57,630
- This is a very easy question.
- Okay.

770
00:45:57,630 --> 00:45:58,730
[A really easy question?]

771
00:45:58,730 --> 00:45:59,920
Yeah, I like questions like that.

772
00:46:00,130 --> 00:46:04,510
<i>This refers to new clothes or new shoes
that one wears on New Year's Day.</i>

773
00:46:04,770 --> 00:46:06,180
<i>The parents...</i>

774
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:08,510
<i>The parents...</i>

775
00:46:10,730 --> 00:46:13,390
[Green Team's last member, Kwang Soo
targets Jae Suk, who seems to know the answer.]

776
00:46:13,390 --> 00:46:15,120
<i>Sung Hoon, it's two words.</i>

777
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:19,190
<i>Your answer is?</i>

778
00:46:19,190 --> 00:46:21,040
[At a quick glance,
it may look like a steamy love scene.]

779
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:22,600
Your pants... your pants.

780
00:46:23,430 --> 00:46:24,850
[Giving him a hint.]

781
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:29,220
[Getting even steamier.]

782
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:31,650
- Sweat suit.
- Excuse me?

783
00:46:31,650 --> 00:46:32,770
Sweat suit.

784
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:36,390
[Sung Hoon's New Year's
outfit is a sweat suit.]

785
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:38,300
Okay!

786
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:40,990
[That's what I wear.]

787
00:46:41,250 --> 00:46:44,720
<i>What is it that you wear before you have the
memorial service on New Year's morning?</i>

788
00:46:47,090 --> 00:46:48,850
<i>That's good, Jae Suk.
You have to get him.</i>

789
00:46:48,850 --> 00:46:49,850
[Chastising the Giraffe.]

790
00:46:49,850 --> 00:46:52,090
I was wrong!
What I did was wrong!

791
00:46:53,490 --> 00:46:56,430
[Broad forehead coming into view
for an easy mark.]

792
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:03,790
What did you just hit me with?

793
00:47:05,610 --> 00:47:08,330
[Unable to believe that the force of that
hit came from just one finger.]

794
00:47:08,330 --> 00:47:10,570
- No, it was just a flick of his finger.
- That wasn't just a flick of his finger!

795
00:47:10,570 --> 00:47:11,800
Wait!

796
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:14,900
[Giraffe still hasn't learned his lesson,
and is trying to attack again?]

797
00:47:16,590 --> 00:47:19,120
[Blocks him immediately with his skills.]

798
00:47:20,670 --> 00:47:23,380
[That's why you need to be choosier about
who you pick your battles with...]

799
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:28,280
[Jae Suk succeeds in getting
a chance to answer?]

800
00:47:28,750 --> 00:47:30,130
<i>Yoo Jae Suk, your answer?</i>

801
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:33,040
Seolbim.

802
00:47:34,050 --> 00:47:35,780
Isn't it Kko-Kka?

803
00:47:35,780 --> 00:47:39,610
[Is his own teammate sabotaging him?]

804
00:47:39,610 --> 00:47:41,270
Isn't it Tae-tae ote?

805
00:47:41,270 --> 00:47:44,150
- Five, four, three, two, one!
- Seolbim.

806
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:47,400
[Blue Team's Jae Suk passes!]

807
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:48,540
We got it!

808
00:47:48,990 --> 00:47:51,590
[Now it's down to Blue Team's Sung Hoon,
and Green Team's Kwang Soo.]

809
00:47:51,590 --> 00:47:53,330
- So I can use my skills then?
- Don't do it!

810
00:47:53,330 --> 00:47:56,460
- Kwang Soo, don't do it!
- Are you out of your mind?

811
00:47:56,700 --> 00:47:58,300
<i>Okay, are you both ready?</i>

812
00:48:00,570 --> 00:48:02,380
- Sung Hoon, you can do it.
- Yes.

813
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:07,130
<i>It was said, if this bird cried out on
New Year's Day, the year would be bountiful.</i>

814
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:08,590
<i>[Magpie!]</i>

815
00:48:08,590 --> 00:48:11,310
<i>What's this auspicious bird species?</i>

816
00:48:12,580 --> 00:48:15,510
[Giraffe takes him on face to face.]

817
00:48:15,510 --> 00:48:18,130
[Or... maybe not.]

818
00:48:25,150 --> 00:48:26,590
[Save me!]

819
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:32,220
[Quiz or whatever, he's going
to see this through to the end!]

820
00:48:32,220 --> 00:48:33,720
Sung Hoon!
You know what to do, right?

821
00:48:34,490 --> 00:48:37,020
[Giraffe's attack coming out to show.]

822
00:48:38,580 --> 00:48:40,540
[With every last drop of his strength...]

823
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:43,770
[However...]

824
00:48:46,510 --> 00:48:49,580
[Sung Hoon escapes the hold,
and counterattacks!]

825
00:48:53,470 --> 00:48:57,300
[His outstanding abilities to escape such a
disadvantageous position to counterattack!]

826
00:48:57,300 --> 00:49:00,150
[Giraffe having met a
formidable match today.]

827
00:49:02,620 --> 00:49:04,300
Kwang Soo, hurry!

828
00:49:04,300 --> 00:49:05,720
Hurry!

829
00:49:08,410 --> 00:49:11,100
[Ah... I bet that hurts.]

830
00:49:16,820 --> 00:49:17,880
<i>Your answer?</i>

831
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:19,810
[Battered and mangled.]

832
00:49:19,810 --> 00:49:22,130
Sung Hoon, relax!
And think carefully.

833
00:49:22,130 --> 00:49:23,760
[If Sung Hoon answers correctly,
it's the end of this mission!]

834
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:25,400
That fish...

835
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:26,980
No, it's not a fish!

836
00:49:26,980 --> 00:49:29,190
- Quiet! You can't say anything!
- Bird... it's a bird!

837
00:49:29,190 --> 00:49:30,200
<i>Tell me the name of the bird.</i>

838
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:32,160
- Magpie?
- That's right!

839
00:49:32,170 --> 00:49:34,610
<i>Yes, it is a magpie,
but which number?</i>

840
00:49:34,610 --> 00:49:37,820
[Another multiple choice?]

841
00:49:38,730 --> 00:49:40,440
Please just end it.

842
00:49:40,660 --> 00:49:42,270
- I'll just give up.
- No, we can't do that.

843
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:44,970
[Feeling like death warmed over.]

844
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:47,730
- Three. Number three.
- Number three, magpie?

845
00:49:47,730 --> 00:49:50,370
[Please, let it be number three...]

846
00:49:53,050 --> 00:49:55,240
<i>The way I see it, there's no
way Kwang Soo can make it out.</i>

847
00:49:55,670 --> 00:49:57,840
- Kwang Soo won't be able to make it out.
- No, he won't make it out.

848
00:49:57,840 --> 00:50:00,020
[Even getting past the starting line
seems like an impossibility.]

849
00:50:00,580 --> 00:50:03,130
<i>Number three is pigeons.
So, your answer was incorrect.</i>

850
00:50:03,130 --> 00:50:04,600
<i>Three, two, one!</i>

851
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:08,440
[Breaks out into
another skirmish as predicted.]

852
00:50:13,590 --> 00:50:15,160
[Did he just hit him?]

853
00:50:17,570 --> 00:50:19,200
I'm so sorry!

854
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:32,230
[So easily caught because of
his long frame.]

855
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:42,190
[Tenacious Giraffe...]

856
00:50:42,190 --> 00:50:46,530
[Makes his way to the table
in a blink of an eye!]

857
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:53,510
[Almost simultaneously!]

858
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:56,090
[Judging the cushions.]

859
00:50:57,630 --> 00:50:59,880
[Sung Hoon's cushion is on the bottom!]

860
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:06,200
[By the split of a second...]

861
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:12,520
[Seriously has dirty, rotten luck.]

862
00:51:14,260 --> 00:51:17,080
Look at how crestfallen Kwang Soo is.

863
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:18,550
- And you answer is?
- Number eight.

864
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:21,750
- Number eight.
- There's no number eight.

865
00:51:23,050 --> 00:51:24,340
Please just end it.

866
00:51:24,340 --> 00:51:26,830
[Just desperately wishing for
this moment to just end...]

867
00:51:28,250 --> 00:51:31,410
Kwang Soo seriously looks like a pile
of fallen leaves on the side of the road.

868
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:34,570
[His life is no different than some leaves
rolling around on the ground by the wind.]

869
00:51:34,570 --> 00:51:36,100
<i>Three, two, one!</i>

870
00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:42,090
[Sung Hoon with his monstrous strength
throws even the chair onto the table!]

871
00:51:43,150 --> 00:51:44,520
No, I'm fine.

872
00:51:50,210 --> 00:51:51,820
You're not angry, are you?

873
00:51:55,890 --> 00:51:58,540
[Not many unbroken chairs
left to speak of.]

874
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:02,090
<i>Lee Kwang Soo,
your correct answer is?</i>

875
00:52:03,820 --> 00:52:05,300
I'm going to answer, okay?

876
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:10,200
- Number seven, magpie.
- A little louder.

877
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:12,910
- Number seven, magpie.
- You're dead if you're right.

878
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:16,360
[Green Team's Kwang Soo succeeds!]

879
00:52:17,710 --> 00:52:19,380
[He almost had the game...]

880
00:52:19,380 --> 00:52:20,970
<i>I told you it was going to
be number seven.</i>

881
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:25,470
[Keep that up,
and you'll be beaten up again...]

882
00:52:25,470 --> 00:52:26,880
Good job, Kwang Soo!

883
00:52:29,340 --> 00:52:32,080
[Anyways, with Kwang Soo's success,
this mission is now over.]

884
00:52:34,810 --> 00:52:36,740
[Red Team wins 2,500 won
for coming in at first place.]

885
00:52:37,340 --> 00:52:38,590
<i>Okay, second place.</i>

886
00:52:38,590 --> 00:52:41,010
[Green Team wins 1,000 won
for coming in at second place.]

887
00:52:42,130 --> 00:52:45,000
Kwang Soo, I bet your medical bills
are going to be more than what's in there.

888
00:52:46,210 --> 00:52:48,320
Kwang Soo, your medical bills
are going to be more than what's in there.

889
00:52:49,210 --> 00:52:52,320
[All my pain and suffering
is in that pouch...]

890
00:52:54,230 --> 00:52:56,270
<i>Sung Hoon, you really did great.</i>

891
00:52:56,270 --> 00:52:58,400
That was too bad, you were so close!

892
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:00,430
- All that matters is that I'm having fun.
- That's right.

893
00:53:00,790 --> 00:53:04,480
<i>[Go to Yongyoo seashore
and find Running Man's landmark.]</i>

894
00:53:11,300 --> 00:53:12,310
What are you looking at?

895
00:53:12,310 --> 00:53:13,430
<i>What are you looking at?</i>

896
00:53:18,830 --> 00:53:19,880
Seriously...

897
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:24,000
I have over 30 thousand ways
to tease someone.

898
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:27,100
My wish is to use them all
on Kwang Soo throughout my life.

899
00:53:29,170 --> 00:53:31,220
Are you going on UFC this summer?

900
00:53:31,220 --> 00:53:34,300
Yes, I'm planning on going
this summer.

901
00:53:34,300 --> 00:53:36,170
Sung Hoon,
I'm sure this is a rhetorical question

902
00:53:36,170 --> 00:53:37,380
but doesn't it seriously hurt?

903
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:41,720
Of course, it hurts.
And it's actually really exhausting.

904
00:53:42,950 --> 00:53:44,290
If hurts more
once the competition is over, right?

905
00:53:44,290 --> 00:53:46,500
It starts to hurt immediately
once the competition is over.

906
00:53:47,220 --> 00:53:49,160
- Immediately.
- But you don't really notice during?

907
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:51,830
It really doesn't hurt then.
I don't notice the pain when I'm fighting.

908
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:54,500
But as soon as it's over, it's immediate.

909
00:53:55,420 --> 00:54:00,670
But I bet that anticipation before you enter
the ring and the competition is no joke.

910
00:54:00,670 --> 00:54:03,040
[The immeasurable amount of anxiety
right before the competition starts.]

911
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:08,300
And I don't think that kind of anxiety
can't be found anywhere else.

912
00:54:08,300 --> 00:54:11,800
It's so physical. A body against
the body up against another body.

913
00:54:13,130 --> 00:54:14,380
That's really...

914
00:54:14,980 --> 00:54:18,950
People like us may just die from a heart
attack just from the anxiety alone.

915
00:54:18,950 --> 00:54:20,300
Before the competition even really starts.

916
00:54:22,580 --> 00:54:24,750
- Okay...
- Wow, we're in first place.

917
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:28,150
[Totally excited!]

918
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:32,640
[Singing a 'Si Young' song?]

919
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:35,250
<i>Si Young...</i>

920
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:38,150
I don't know if it's because I'm happy,
but the words are just flowing out.

921
00:54:38,150 --> 00:54:40,280
It's just flowing out of you.
From the melody to the lyrics.

922
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:56,130
The 'jjuk-jjuk' part is the chorus.
I want you guys to sing it with me.

923
00:55:10,620 --> 00:55:12,740
- I like that.
- Not bad, right?

924
00:55:13,470 --> 00:55:14,520
<i>Okay, we're here.</i>

925
00:55:14,550 --> 00:55:15,910
[Blue Team arrives at their destination.]

926
00:55:15,910 --> 00:55:17,420
This is the place, Ha Ha.

927
00:55:17,690 --> 00:55:19,160
Ha Ha, this is the place.

928
00:55:19,940 --> 00:55:21,390
It's a tidal flat.

929
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:26,410
[Third mission location,
The tidal flats of terror!]

930
00:55:27,410 --> 00:55:29,810
<i>Since you're the first team to arrive,
you move up to the final round.</i>

931
00:55:29,810 --> 00:55:30,830
We are?

932
00:55:30,830 --> 00:55:32,120
[Blue Team is chosen to move up to the
final round for being the first to arrive.]

933
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:33,980
- We're moving onto the final round.
- Really? That's awesome.

934
00:55:34,420 --> 00:55:36,630
The Blue Team beat us here.

935
00:55:37,270 --> 00:55:40,590
- We were too focused on singing.
- Did we get here too leisurely?

936
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:43,260
Do you think we're going to
have to wrestle?

937
00:55:43,770 --> 00:55:45,620
<i>I have a bad feeling
we're going to be wrestling.</i>

938
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:47,130
[Bingo!]

939
00:55:55,620 --> 00:55:57,080
We're getting harmonious now.

940
00:55:57,430 --> 00:56:00,010
[Their unstopping song singing.]

941
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:04,690
[Coach Kkuk giving
a crash course in wrestling.]

942
00:56:04,690 --> 00:56:06,290
<i>Don't do it, don't do it!</i>

943
00:56:06,610 --> 00:56:07,940
He's watching everything.

944
00:56:10,210 --> 00:56:13,180
You already know everything,
Sung Hoon. This is what you do.

945
00:56:13,180 --> 00:56:15,500
- Look at you playing dumb.
- No, I'm being serious.

match looming ahead of them?]

[Battle of strength that's on
a whole different scale!]

<i>Okay, this is the tidal flats wrestling.
A round of applause!</i>

955
00:56:53,770 --> 00:56:55,410
Why would we want to applaud this?

<i>First things first,
Blue Team moves up to the final round.</i>

957

[Blue Team is seeded to the final round
for having been the first to arrive.]

<i>This round will be between the
Red Team and the Green Team.</i>

959

<i>And the first competition will be
Lee Si Young vs. Song Ji Hyo.</i>

960
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:10,670
This is going to be quite the competition.

961
00:57:11,140 --> 00:57:12,860
- Lee Si Young, fighting!
- Ji Hyo, you can do this!

962
00:57:15,270 --> 00:57:18,220
[Strength for strength!
Skill for skill!]

- Ji Hyo and Si Young...
- This is going to be a good match.

967
00:57:32,980 --> 00:57:34,580
No use of fists, okay?

968
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:38,260
Ji Hyo beat me the last time.

969
00:57:38,260 --> 00:57:39,690
You can't take her lightly.

970
00:57:39,690 --> 00:57:41,290
<i>Here's the rule of the game.</i>

971
00:57:41,290 --> 00:57:45,890
<i>It's an all-kill game where the winner will
keep going as far as they can go.</i>

[All-kill game where the winner can keep on
playing as long as they keep winning!]

Si Young, just finish them all for us.

974
00:57:49,580 --> 00:57:51,100
You can finish them all.

Lee Si Young is, right?

She runs three times a week,
for eight km at a time.

977

And you all know our Ji Hyo, right?

978
00:57:59,250 --> 00:58:01,370
She eats about eight kg
of food a week...

979
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:12,930
Her jabs are just part of her
daily routine.

980
00:58:13,380 --> 00:58:15,670
Why don't you give us a show?

981
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:22,580
- Stop it!
- Why do you keep shaking your hips?

982
00:58:22,580 --> 00:58:25,730
- When Si Young plays...
- This is not what you do!

983
00:58:25,740 --> 00:58:27,910
This is how we were taught
when I was little.

984
00:58:27,910 --> 00:58:31,050
You just loosen up your arms,
and jab like this.

[Tidal front being an unknown factor,
can't predict what could happen!]

We can't pull our feet out.

989
00:58:42,420 --> 00:58:44,920
- We can't predict what's going to happen.
- No, we can't predict it.

990
00:58:47,420 --> 00:58:50,340
Nice grip.
That's a nice grip you've got on the tie.

991
00:58:50,340 --> 00:58:52,730
Pull your feet out... pull your feet out.

992

01:29:24,910 --> 01:29:28,060
Jong Kook... just another cm closer.

01:29:29,850 --> 01:29:31,330
- Good?
- Yes.

1480
01:29:31,330 --> 01:29:32,990
