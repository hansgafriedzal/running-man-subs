00:09:01,306 --> 00:09:03,420
- Why can't you look her in the eye?
- Sung Woong, say hi to her.

167
00:09:04,316 --> 00:09:06,695
[Jung Min keeps on greeting her while
averting his eyes elsewhere.]

168
00:09:06,696 --> 00:09:08,222
Why do you keep looking elsewhere
as you're saying hello?

169
00:09:08,223 --> 00:09:11,315
- It's because I'm so cold!
- Because you're cold?

170
00:09:11,626 --> 00:09:16,200
<i>Since I'm sure you're all very cold right now,
I will announce the two teams first.</i>

171
00:09:16,533 --> 00:09:18,512
<i>As I mentioned earlier,
you will be divided into two teams.</i>

172
00:09:18,513 --> 00:09:21,815
<i>It will be
Actor Team vs. the Singer Team.</i>

173
00:09:21,816 --> 00:09:24,902
- That will be the two teams.
- What about the comedians?

174
00:09:24,903 --> 00:09:27,169
<i>I will start by announcing
the Actor Team members first.</i>

175
00:09:27,439 --> 00:09:30,167
<i>The Team Leader will be
Hwang Jung Min.</i>

176
00:09:30,168 --> 00:09:31,743
[Actor Team's Team Leader is
Hwang Jung Min.]

177
00:09:34,498 --> 00:09:37,377
<i>And the first team member is,
Park Sung Woong.</i>

178
00:09:37,378 --> 00:09:39,535
<i>And... Song Ji Hyo.</i>

179
00:09:39,536 --> 00:09:41,746
And finally...

180
00:09:42,795 --> 00:09:45,427
- Weren't you in a movie?
- Yes, I was in a movie!

181
00:09:45,428 --> 00:09:48,540
- And lastly...
- You're putting Kwang Soo in the Actor Team?

182
00:09:49,155 --> 00:09:51,961
- Since Lee Kwang Soo is an actor...
- No way!

183
00:09:51,962 --> 00:09:54,460
- He's a comedian!
- How am I a comedian?

184
00:09:54,461 --> 00:09:56,876
- Lee Kwang Soo is the next member.
- I was in a movie too!

185
00:09:56,877 --> 00:09:58,167
<i>And the final member is, Yoo Jae Suk.</i>

186
00:09:58,168 --> 00:10:01,154
[What? Jae Suk on the Actor Team?]

187
00:10:01,155 --> 00:10:03,954
<i>Even though I'm sure that you may all know,
back in the day, Yoo Jae Suk...</i>

188
00:10:04,156 --> 00:10:07,104
[I guess... he has some experience with
being in a movie a very long time ago.]

189
00:10:07,105 --> 00:10:09,076
No way!

190
00:10:09,538 --> 00:10:15,496
[His brief appearance in
'The Space Monsters'.]

191
00:10:15,497 --> 00:10:17,382
<i>The mission that all of you
will have to carry out today...</i>

192
00:10:17,383 --> 00:10:21,919
<i>is a mission that your boss...
Go Dong Wan will be giving you.</i>

193
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,323
<i>Today's mission is...</i>

194
00:10:23,435 --> 00:10:26,528
<i>A bloody bag acquisition race.</i>

195
00:10:26,529 --> 00:10:29,206
[A bloody bag acquisition race]

196
00:10:30,147 --> 00:10:33,640
[Carry out the mission at each location...]

197
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:36,516
[And the winning team will earn hints to where
the bag is hidden at the final location.]

198
00:10:36,572 --> 00:10:43,197
<i>The first team to find all seven bags at
the final location and get them to the boss</i>

199
00:10:43,198 --> 00:10:44,744
<i>will be the ultimate
winning team of the day.</i>

200
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:48,899
[We will win!]

201
00:10:50,754 --> 00:10:52,887
- Why are you guys singing?
- Let's say a cheers!

202
00:10:53,454 --> 00:10:55,728
<i>With each mission that your
team wins</i>

203
00:10:55,728 --> 00:10:58,205
<i>you will be given hints to where
those seven bags are hidden.</i>

204
00:10:58,205 --> 00:10:59,759
<i>So it's important for you to
win these missions.</i>

205
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:00,763
I understand.

206
00:11:00,764 --> 00:11:02,907
[Bloody bag acquisition race - Start!]

207
00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:04,824
I feel like we're going on a picnic.

208
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,665
Want to go somewhere?

209
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:10,848
Where do you...
what do you mean, go somewhere?

210
00:11:11,102 --> 00:11:14,404
You really like
getting out of the house.

211
00:11:15,306 --> 00:11:18,747
[Full of joy whenever he's out
of the house?]

212
00:11:19,255 --> 00:11:23,124
At least Kwang Soo's been in movies,
but I...

213
00:11:23,125 --> 00:11:25,272
Weren't you in a drama once?

214
00:11:25,273 --> 00:11:27,484
Maybe you're like our manager
for the day.

215
00:11:27,485 --> 00:11:28,962
What are you talking about?

216
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:33,391
Kwang Soo... Ji Hyo knew it.
I used to be in parody dramas.

217
00:11:33,782 --> 00:11:36,327
[His parodies that used to be
shown every week.]

218
00:11:36,466 --> 00:11:38,999
- That's what I used to do.
- Yes, you did do that.

219
00:11:39,662 --> 00:11:42,468
- We have to go to Hongdae first.
- Hongdae?

220
00:11:42,469 --> 00:11:44,650
<i>Go to the streets of Hongdae
and find the Running Man landmark.</i>

221
00:11:45,135 --> 00:11:47,289
Kwang Soo, don't you know your way
around Hongdae pretty well?

222
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:48,649
Yes, I really like Hongdae.

223
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:51,217
- Hongdae isn't what you like.
- Then what is it?

224
00:11:51,459 --> 00:11:54,966
I'm sure it's the women in Hongdae
that you like.

225
00:11:54,967 --> 00:11:57,530
It's because you keep teasing me like this
that I can't even date.

226
00:11:57,531 --> 00:12:00,154
- What do you mean, you can't?
- Kwang Soo really like girls?

227
00:12:00,155 --> 00:12:02,269
- He loves girls.
- Honey?

228
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:03,348
- It's no joke how much he loves them.
- Honey... hilarious!

229
00:12:03,348 --> 00:12:06,083
- Why are you so suddenly...
- What is he doing?

230
00:12:06,084 --> 00:12:08,972
- Why are you calling your wife so suddenly?
- What is Sung Woong doing?

231
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:12,384
[Actress, Shin Eun Jung]
My wife just called, so I had to answer.

232
00:12:12,783 --> 00:12:14,766
- Yes, go ahead.
- We're filming right now though.

233
00:12:15,929 --> 00:12:18,616
You should just apologize and tell her
that you'll call her back later.

234
00:12:18,617 --> 00:12:21,130
But how can you just say honey,
and answer the phone instead?

235
00:12:21,131 --> 00:12:24,030
Above all else, it's phone calls from
the wife that shouldn't be answered.

236
00:12:24,885 --> 00:12:26,545
Jung Min, you really are something else.

237
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:29,182
- It's not because he doesn't love her.
- Of course not.

238
00:12:29,183 --> 00:12:31,884
- It's because this is work.
- I have a honey too.

239
00:12:32,788 --> 00:12:35,993
Jung Min, everyone has
their own style.

240
00:12:35,994 --> 00:12:38,396
Jung Min, did you know that Sung Woong used
to be a volleyball player back in the day?

241
00:12:38,397 --> 00:12:39,546
No, I didn't know that.

242
00:12:39,547 --> 00:12:45,402
And Sung Woong trained for a long time
at the action school too.

243
00:12:46,731 --> 00:12:49,984
That's why Sung Woong provoked
Jong Kook as soon as he arrived earlier.

244
00:12:51,033 --> 00:12:53,473
I'm not sure if Jung Min's good at games,
I don't really remember.

245
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:56,624
You have no idea how charismatic Jung Min is
on site when we're shooting the film.

246
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:59,361
- Jung Min...
- Hey, where are you going?

247
00:12:59,362 --> 00:13:01,201
- Oh my goodness.
- That car was just slowing down.

248
00:13:01,202 --> 00:13:03,843
- Ugh, you really scared me.
- You have a lot of fear, don't you?

249
00:13:05,191 --> 00:13:07,995
As soon as Sung Woong tells us
about how charismatic you can be...

250
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:10,760
[Charisma pulling a disappearing act.]

251
00:13:13,533 --> 00:13:15,881
Is Jung Min really like that on movie sets?
Really?

252
00:13:15,882 --> 00:13:17,048
Yes, he's really amazing.

253
00:13:17,049 --> 00:13:19,812
Oh... I've never once seen that side
of him while shooting variety shows.

254
00:13:20,654 --> 00:13:23,722
I think he's very good at
fitting into the environment he's in.

255
00:13:23,723 --> 00:13:25,603
So that's why his name is
Hwang Jung Min...

256
00:13:26,623 --> 00:13:29,590
[What was that?]

257
00:13:29,591 --> 00:13:31,542
Hey, that's why his name is
Hwang Jung Min.

258
00:13:31,543 --> 00:13:34,591
- Go to the streets of Hongdae...
- It's Hongdae.

259
00:13:34,592 --> 00:13:37,567
- There it is!
- Look... there it is.

260
00:13:37,568 --> 00:13:40,133
<i>- Let's go!
- Let's get out.</i>

261
00:13:40,916 --> 00:13:43,629
[Even in the midst of cold winter rain,
the streets are still busy and bustling.]

262
00:13:44,744 --> 00:13:47,129
<i>Okay, you're the first team to arrive.
The Singer Team.</i>

263
00:13:47,225 --> 00:13:49,513
- Singer?
- Yes, he is a singer.

264
00:13:49,514 --> 00:13:51,674
I made my debut back in 1991.

265
00:13:51,675 --> 00:13:53,673
<i>'Secret mission'- Find the members who are
undercover and get them dressed?</i>

266
00:13:53,674 --> 00:13:54,874
<i>What does that mean?</i>

267
00:13:55,353 --> 00:13:57,204
<i>From each of the teams...</i>

268
00:13:57,205 --> 00:14:01,696
[Pick one person who's confident in
their abilities at finding people.]

269
00:14:01,696 --> 00:14:07,253
[And the remaining four members will stay
in hiding at their designated spots.]

270
00:14:07,254 --> 00:14:09,662
- Yes, then what?
- We've already designated your locations.

271
00:14:09,998 --> 00:14:12,264
<i>You have to choose one person
who's going to go on the search.</i>

272
00:14:12,527 --> 00:14:14,251
[Undercover?]

273
00:14:16,513 --> 00:14:19,629
[Search and find all your team members that
are in hiding around the streets of Hongdae!]

274
00:14:19,629 --> 00:14:22,032
- Don't you think Gary would be good at this?
- Do you know your area around Hongdae well?

275
00:14:22,033 --> 00:14:23,888
- Yes, I know it very well.
- Okay, then let's go with Gary.

276
00:14:23,889 --> 00:14:26,768
- I used to hang out here a lot.
- Okay, then let's choose Gary.

277
00:14:27,455 --> 00:14:30,210
- We choose Jung Min.
- Then I just need to find you guys?

278
00:14:30,211 --> 00:14:31,887
- Yes, you just need to find us.
- Okay then.

279
00:14:31,888 --> 00:14:35,313
<i>Then, why don't we have the searchers
come out here? Jung Min and Gary.</i>

280
00:14:35,755 --> 00:14:37,462
Don't these two give off a similar vibe?

281
00:14:37,463 --> 00:14:38,806
[The feeling is a bit...]

282
00:14:38,807 --> 00:14:42,063
- Why are you saying that?
- I'm curious as to who's going to win.

283
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,781
<i>I get a very similar vibe
coming from those two.</i>

284
00:14:43,782 --> 00:14:46,702
<i>Then the rest of you will be going to the
location we've designated for you.</i>

285
00:14:46,956 --> 00:14:50,440
<i>Those of you who will be hiding...
please take off your coats right now.</i>

286
00:14:50,441 --> 00:14:51,458
- What?
- Huh?

287
00:14:54,885 --> 00:15:00,517
[The searcher will go around looking for his
teammates while wearing his coat.]

288
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,101
<i> And the moment you find one,
you give them a coat.</i>

289
00:15:03,102 --> 00:15:06,517
- Okay, let's do this quickly.
- Let's do this. Go! Go!

290
00:15:06,518 --> 00:15:09,690
<i>As soon as a person is found,
that person has to go in the ladder.</i>

291
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:11,212
Okay, we get it!

292
00:15:11,247 --> 00:15:12,750
Unless it's in order,
we won't get in the ladder.

293
00:15:12,751 --> 00:15:15,533
<i>Now, since it's cold,
why don't you all say a cheer before...</i>

294
00:15:15,534 --> 00:15:17,980
- What the heck are you saying!
- It's cold. Let's hurry!

295
00:15:17,981 --> 00:15:22,890
<i>Okay, numbers two through five,
go towards the back and you'll see a car.</i>

296
00:15:22,891 --> 00:15:24,690
[The members who are to hide
heads off first.]

297
00:15:24,691 --> 00:15:26,836
- Find us quickly!
- Fighting!

298
00:15:26,837 --> 00:15:28,628
Sung Woong, fighting.

299
00:15:29,219 --> 00:15:34,377
<i>Here's the map to the designated areas
where your teammates will be waiting.</i>

300
00:15:34,378 --> 00:15:36,983
[A map where their teammates are hiding...]

301
00:15:39,611 --> 00:15:42,866
[Only the locations are marked,
but there aren't any numbers!]

302
00:15:43,265 --> 00:15:46,234
<i>If you find number three when you're supposed
to find two, you can't pick up that person.</i>

303
00:15:46,235 --> 00:15:47,380
Jung Min...

304
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:50,616
[Now that we take a look...]

305
00:15:50,617 --> 00:15:52,956
For now...
I'll work hard at the first couple games.

306
00:15:52,956 --> 00:15:54,044
- I've got a great idea!
- What?

307
00:15:54,677 --> 00:15:56,588
Whenever you and I see each other,
we'll just...

308
00:15:58,247 --> 00:15:59,754
- Like this?
- It'll be our sign.

309
00:15:59,755 --> 00:16:00,873
I understand.

310
00:16:00,873 --> 00:16:05,346
If others see us doing that, they'll
think that we're greeting each other.

311
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:08,589
- We'll just... say that's our greeting.
- A greeting we've always done.

312
00:16:09,389 --> 00:16:12,181
Jong Kook... what should we do?
How should we do this?

313
00:16:12,182 --> 00:16:15,517
- Do I have to keep losing at everything?
- No. No, you don't.

314
00:16:15,979 --> 00:16:18,849
You need to get close to the team members,
and get me whatever information you can.

315
00:16:18,849 --> 00:16:21,914
So get me whatever information
you can.

316
00:16:21,915 --> 00:16:23,307
- Really?
- Of course.

317
00:16:23,308 --> 00:16:25,250
I'll signal to you like this
if I want you to lose a game.

318
00:16:25,251 --> 00:16:27,406
Ah... that's your sign for me to lose?

319
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:29,572
Jung Min... depending on the situation...

320
00:16:30,269 --> 00:16:32,330
Depending on the situation,
I'll lose if I can.

321
00:16:32,331 --> 00:16:33,423
Then I'd be grateful.

322
00:16:33,423 --> 00:16:36,429
But if there's no way around it, I may
have to win since it's the first game.

323
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:39,423
[Okay... since we can't get caught,
let's just play it by ear!]

324
00:16:39,424 --> 00:16:41,606
[The important thing is information
on the other team!]

325
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:46,537
[Going undercover is complete!]

326
00:16:48,065 --> 00:16:49,511
- Gary...
- Yes?

327
00:16:49,852 --> 00:16:52,990
- Let's at least do our thing.
- Okay.

328
00:16:56,115 --> 00:16:58,185
[Heading off to find
their Teammate number two!]

329
00:17:02,744 --> 00:17:03,896
Wait...

330
00:17:05,462 --> 00:17:07,027
[Could this real estate office...
be the one on the map?]

331
00:17:07,028 --> 00:17:10,151
- Is this the place?
- No, this isn't it.

332
00:17:11,515 --> 00:17:14,020
[Team Leader Hwang heading on
without a slightest bit of hesitation.]

333
00:17:16,571 --> 00:17:18,947
What if this is number five?

334
00:17:19,381 --> 00:17:20,904
<i>I feel like this is going to
be number five.</i>

335
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,337
- Number five...
- I'm just going to keep on following you!

336
00:17:25,338 --> 00:17:27,021
- We're number two!
- You're here!

337
00:17:27,584 --> 00:17:29,925
[Discovers number two while
on their way!]

338
00:17:31,248 --> 00:17:33,623
[Putting the coat back on quickly...]

339
00:17:33,624 --> 00:17:35,776
Here, put your coat on.
You were standing out in the rain?

340
00:17:35,777 --> 00:17:37,388
- We've just been standing out here.
- You've been standing in the rain?

341
00:17:37,872 --> 00:17:39,171
<i>- There's a real estate office!
- Where?</i>

342
00:17:39,172 --> 00:17:41,938
- There. Up there.
- Watch your feet... be careful.

343
00:17:41,939 --> 00:17:44,502
[Could number three be towards
the real estate office?]

344
00:17:47,498 --> 00:17:49,602
Don't you think it would be around here?
Oh! there it is!

345
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:52,792
[Oh? But that's number four...]

346
00:17:52,792 --> 00:17:54,740
What the heck? This isn't it.
It's not time for you yet.

347
00:17:55,275 --> 00:17:57,697
- You're number four.
- Number four is over here!

348
00:17:59,059 --> 00:18:01,978
- Jong Kook, it's not Hyuna. Not Hyuna.
- It's not Hyuna! Not her turn yet.

349
00:18:03,814 --> 00:18:05,629
Where are those guys going?

350
00:18:06,924 --> 00:18:08,408
I see someone over there.

351
00:18:08,409 --> 00:18:10,046
- You see someone?
- Jung Min, I'm over here!

352
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:12,678
- Jung Min, I'm over here!
- He's number five! Keep going!

353
00:18:12,679 --> 00:18:14,664
[Huh? Number five team is...]

354
00:18:14,665 --> 00:18:16,814
- No, it's not time for them yet!
- Wait.. wait right there.

355
00:18:16,815 --> 00:18:18,032
We need number three!

356
00:18:19,364 --> 00:18:22,379
- Kwang Soo, what number are you?
- I'm three! Go to your left!

357
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:24,929
[With the exception of number three,
they've discovered four and five...]

358
00:18:26,352 --> 00:18:29,408
How is Jung Min supposed to find me when
we're hiding so far back like this?

359
00:18:29,409 --> 00:18:31,122
There's no way they're going to
be able to find us here.

360
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:35,551
[Automatically breaking out the boxing
moves from the frigid weather.]

361
00:18:36,447 --> 00:18:38,840
- Have you boxed before or something?
- Of course!

362
00:18:40,586 --> 00:18:42,363
[Their playfulness makes it impossible
for them to hide out in quiet.]

363
00:18:43,097 --> 00:18:44,562
[Joking around with one another
as if they were back to being little kids.]

364
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:47,776
Do you have to change the tape
on that thing?

365
00:18:47,777 --> 00:18:48,799
[A surprise attack!]

366
00:18:50,413 --> 00:18:52,084
Jae Suk, your shoelace is untied.

367
00:18:53,397 --> 00:18:54,803
Oh, hi there!

368
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:59,136
[Nonstop...]

369
00:19:02,059 --> 00:19:03,307
You can't beat that, can you?

370
00:19:08,646 --> 00:19:10,748
[Their lightning fast kisses.]

371
00:19:13,854 --> 00:19:16,034
- This is exhausting!
- I'm exhausted!

372
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:19,336
- There it is!
- This is it!

373
00:19:20,842 --> 00:19:22,814
[Finally discovers three!]

374
00:19:22,815 --> 00:19:24,466
- There they come!
- What the heck?

375
00:19:24,467 --> 00:19:25,872
How did you find us here?

376
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:27,500
There they are!
They're here!

377
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:29,913
[Singer Team also arrives]

378
00:19:29,914 --> 00:19:31,772
- Come on, hurry up!
- Okay, I'm done.

379
00:19:33,101 --> 00:19:35,262
Okay, let's go.
We're good to go, right?

380
00:19:35,773 --> 00:19:38,884
[Actor Team heads out first by
split of a second difference.]

381
00:19:38,885 --> 00:19:40,514
We can't go like this.

382
00:19:41,264 --> 00:19:43,273
- We have to go horizontally.
- How did you find us?

383
00:19:43,274 --> 00:19:45,871
- We were given a map.
- You had a map?

384
00:19:46,527 --> 00:19:48,437
- We have a map.
- Ah, you have a map?

385
00:19:48,438 --> 00:19:50,351
We saw everyone else
on our way here.

386
00:19:51,557 --> 00:19:52,956
We can just follow them.
Let's hurry.

387
00:19:52,957 --> 00:19:54,122
Let's hurry up and follow them.

388
00:19:54,123 --> 00:19:56,715
- Let's follow them.
- One, two! One, two!

389
00:19:56,716 --> 00:19:58,805
- One, two! One, two!
- Run... run!

390
00:20:00,367 --> 00:20:02,538
- Let's stay strong guys. Stay strong!
- Fighting!

391
00:20:03,225 --> 00:20:04,788
Wait...

392
00:20:06,952 --> 00:20:08,881
- I feel like I'm going to collapse.
- Stay strong... stay strong.

393
00:20:09,493 --> 00:20:12,238
[Is Gary in his full operation mode?]

394
00:20:12,239 --> 00:20:15,249
That place we thought earlier
must be the right place.

395
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:16,800
Hurry!
We have to run faster.

396
00:20:17,085 --> 00:20:18,131
- Jong Kook!
- What?

397
00:20:18,132 --> 00:20:20,164
- Don't you think they'll be to the left?
- No, we have to go right.

398
00:20:20,165 --> 00:20:22,425
- Isn't Hyuna the last one?
- No, it's not Hyuna.

399
00:20:22,426 --> 00:20:23,854
- Suk Jin is the last one.
- Suk Jin is last.

400
00:20:24,644 --> 00:20:27,004
[Team Leader Kkuk
not getting roped in very easily...]

401
00:20:32,478 --> 00:20:35,204
[Actor Team heading to where
number four is waiting!]

402
00:20:35,672 --> 00:20:36,905
No!

403
00:20:36,906 --> 00:20:38,320
- Are you leaving?
- Yeah.

404
00:20:38,321 --> 00:20:39,944
Don't go...

405
00:20:40,059 --> 00:20:41,805
<i>Don't go...</i>

406
00:20:41,806 --> 00:20:43,447
[Attacking him with her gaze.]

407
00:20:48,481 --> 00:20:49,834
Hyuna won't let me go.

408
00:20:49,835 --> 00:20:51,383
- What?
- She doesn't want me to go.

409
00:20:51,384 --> 00:20:52,437
So you're not going to come?

410
00:20:54,334 --> 00:20:57,968
[She's got her hold on me,
what am I supposed to do...]

411
00:21:01,152 --> 00:21:03,536
- Come on!
- Just come.

412
00:21:03,985 --> 00:21:05,540
[Team Leader Hwang's screaming order!]

413
00:21:05,541 --> 00:21:07,361
- Come on, hurry!
- Does he really have to go?

414
00:21:08,505 --> 00:21:10,236
It's really been a long time since
something like this has happened to me.

415
00:21:10,237 --> 00:21:11,925
- What is?
- It really has been a long time.

416
00:21:11,926 --> 00:21:13,819
- Hurry up and come on!
- But she doesn't want me to go.

417
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:15,307
Kwang Soo, please don't go.

418
00:21:15,308 --> 00:21:17,977
- They're coming. Let's go.
- They're here.

419
00:21:17,978 --> 00:21:20,047
- They're here. I have to go.
- Wait...

420
00:21:20,048 --> 00:21:22,700
- Hyuna...
- Look what you did.

421
00:21:24,279 --> 00:21:27,536
- Hurry up! Hurry!
- I was holding onto Kwang Soo.

422
00:21:29,555 --> 00:21:31,471
We have to walk horizontally.

423
00:21:31,472 --> 00:21:33,935
- Let's go horizontally.
- Hyuna, it's been fun.

424
00:21:33,936 --> 00:21:35,526
- Hurry.
- Don't forget me, okay?

425
00:21:37,579 --> 00:21:40,368
[The gap between the two teams are
closing in from Hyuna's little trap.]

426
00:21:41,899 --> 00:21:44,868
[Walking down the main street of Hongdae
in the rain with the ladder.]

427
00:21:44,869 --> 00:21:46,937
- Is this the place?
- This way... it's this way.

428
00:21:48,666 --> 00:21:50,595
[Arrives at the location where
their fifth team member is waiting!]

429

Come on, hurry.

430
00:21:52,687 --> 00:21:54,208
Here, put your coat on.

431
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:56,189
How did you guys get here so quickly?

432
00:21:57,967 --> 00:22:00,471
[Singer Team also arrives at the location.]

433
00:22:02,364 --> 00:22:04,698
[All they have to do now is
to get to the finish line!]

434
00:22:13,319 --> 00:22:15,443
[Kkuk with a tight grip on the
other team!]

435
00:22:17,126 --> 00:22:19,317
[You're not going anywhere!]

436
00:22:25,829 --> 00:22:29,273
[After obstructing their path...
overtakes them in the race!]

437
00:22:32,039 --> 00:22:34,897
[Heading towards the finish line!]

438

[It's not over yet.]

441
00:22:52,069 --> 00:22:53,988

move the beans with the chopsticks.]

[Starting from the right to the left,
and back to the right to succeed.]

445
00:23:03,166 --> 00:23:05,466
Kwang Soo...
you have to be careful and fast.

446
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:06,876
Kwang Soo!

447
00:23:07,151 --> 00:23:09,009
- Kwang Soo!
- Hey, brat!

448
00:23:09,641 --> 00:23:11,324
- Kwang Soo!
- Hey, brat!

449
00:23:11,325 --> 00:23:12,642
Hurry!

450

[Passes after quite some time...]

451

[And the Singer Team is caught up
during Hyuna's turn.]

452
00:23:19,141 --> 00:23:21,664
- Hyuna!
- Hyuna's from the fork generation.

453
00:23:23,874 --> 00:23:25,405
What do I do?

454
00:23:26,089 --> 00:23:28,192
- Hyuna, come on...
- I got it!

455
00:23:28,193 --> 00:23:31,557
- That's right, that's right.
- I'm not used to these chopsticks.

456
00:23:31,558 --> 00:23:34,081
[Gary's overtly obvious
fumble with the chopsticks.]

457
00:23:34,082 --> 00:23:35,918

You're good at this!

458

how the other team is doing.]

464
00:23:53,693 --> 00:23:55,506
[Is he trying to eat it?]

465
00:23:58,649 --> 00:24:00,124
[Blood curdling screams at
the drop of one little bean.]

466

[Quickly moving it back to the right.]

467

all the way back to Jae Suk!]

469

the bean that he dropped...]

[The bean gets passed back to Gary.]

473
00:24:19,868 --> 00:24:21,839
- Lift it. Lift it off the plate.
- Slide it to the side and get it.

474
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,149
It's not easy to lift.

475
00:24:23,944 --> 00:24:27,453
[Trying to lose the game without
making it so obvious....]

476

Or will it be Hyuna?]

at moving the bean!]

- No, that's not it.

487
00:25:09,583 --> 00:25:11,806
- It's the Singer Team's win.
- Yeah!

488
00:25:12,832 --> 00:25:14,437
Move back, and you come here.

489
00:25:15,161 --> 00:25:16,332
It's not me!

490
00:25:16,333 --> 00:25:17,564
It really isn't me!

491
00:25:17,565 --> 00:25:19,330
[Team Leader Hwang's style is to scold
those who needs scolding.]

492
00:25:19,330 --> 00:25:21,044
It's not him. Jae Suk is the one
who dropped the bean.

493
00:25:21,045 --> 00:25:22,751
- It wasn't me.
- Really?

494
00:25:22,752 --> 00:25:26,091
If I had just dropped it on his plate,
we would've been fine.

495
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:29,357
Come over here.
What's wrong with you!

496
00:25:29,358 --> 00:25:32,658
- Jung Min, we're just starting right now.
- Scold him and teach him a lesson.

497
00:25:34,809 --> 00:25:39,271
<i>Here's a clue which will help you find where
the bags are at your final location.</i>

498
00:25:40,141 --> 00:25:42,114
[Earns two hints!]

499
00:25:42,539 --> 00:25:44,147
[The seven bags that are hidden
at the final location.]

500
00:25:44,147 --> 00:25:46,321
[Able to earn two hints to the whereabouts of
the bags when they win a mission.]

501
00:25:46,322 --> 00:25:48,291
<i>I can't believe I dropped that
at the end.</i>

502
00:25:48,946 --> 00:25:52,352
Jung Min, why are you
looking so deflated already?

503
00:25:52,353 --> 00:25:54,158
Don't look so depressed and chin up.

504
00:25:54,158 --> 00:25:55,954
It's no big deal.

505
00:25:56,668 --> 00:25:58,211
[Team Leader Hwang remaining silent
with his lips firmly shut.]

506
00:25:58,212 --> 00:26:00,020
Jung Min, we can just do
better at the next one.

507
00:26:00,021 --> 00:26:01,546
We'll just win at the second mission.

508
00:26:02,693 --> 00:26:04,480
Please help us win, Kwang Soo.

509
00:26:04,974 --> 00:26:06,919
- Jae Suk...
- Yeah?

510
00:26:07,828 --> 00:26:10,734
Since the cameras are rolling,
I can't really cuss at you right now.

511
00:26:11,717 --> 00:26:13,167
That's why I'm staying quiet right now.

512
00:26:13,168 --> 00:26:15,063
[Frustrated because he can't even scold
Jae Suk with the cameras rolling?]

513
00:26:15,063 --> 00:26:17,474
Ji Hyo, Sung Woong and I
really worked hard.

514
00:26:18,033 --> 00:26:21,373
- Is that why you're so mad?
- Why are you so bad with chopsticks?

515
00:26:21,865 --> 00:26:23,062
Is that why you're quiet?

516
00:26:23,063 --> 00:26:25,881
[Ah... even though he's angry,
because of the camera...]

517
00:26:25,882 --> 00:26:28,998
- He's really annoyed right now.
- Ah... you're that annoyed?

518
00:26:28,999 --> 00:26:32,530
That's good then. It's better to be annoyed
than sitting there all deflated.

519
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:35,133
You're really holding
yourself back right now, aren't you?

520
00:26:35,586 --> 00:26:38,345
You're really holding back even though
you're angry right now, aren't you?

521
00:26:38,894 --> 00:26:40,462
Can't we shut this out?

522
00:26:40,463 --> 00:26:42,666
Jung Min, what's wrong with you?
Why would we want them out?

523
00:26:42,667 --> 00:26:44,873
Why would you want to shut
the cameras out?

524
00:26:45,651 --> 00:26:48,268
- What are you doing, Jung Min?
- Say you were wrong! Say you're sorry!

525
00:26:48,269 --> 00:26:50,260
- Why are you shutting them out?
- Tell him you'll work harder!

526
00:26:50,261 --> 00:26:52,526
- Seriously...
- He's really scary.

527
00:26:52,686 --> 00:26:57,294
Why... would you drop the bean when
you already had it in your grasp?

528
00:26:57,295 --> 00:26:59,256
Things like that can happen
during a game.

529
00:26:59,256 --> 00:27:00,294
[Team Leader Hwang with
a never-ending grudge.]

530
00:27:00,295 --> 00:27:01,458
Seriously...

531
00:27:01,493 --> 00:27:03,689
When that bean dropped, I thought
my heart was going to drop too.

532
00:27:05,199 --> 00:27:08,235
[They're acting very suspicious...]

533
00:27:08,236 --> 00:27:10,259
<i>- Here it is...
- I see it, there it is!</i>

534
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:12,928
[Arrives at the second mission location.]

535
00:27:12,929 --> 00:27:14,211
<i>- We're here.
- What is this place?</i>

536
00:27:14,212 --> 00:27:16,237
[Second mission location -
Chinese restaurant.]

537
00:27:17,171 --> 00:27:19,736
- What is this?
- What are we doing while sitting down?

538
00:27:20,848 --> 00:27:23,732
Wow... a Chinese restaurant.
It smells so good in here.

539
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:27,644
<i>Your second mission is...
a psychological battle.</i>

540
00:27:27,645 --> 00:27:29,185
I like psychological games.

541
00:27:29,186 --> 00:27:32,619
Jung Min said he's not going to leave me
alone if we don't win the second game.

542
00:27:33,614 --> 00:27:35,894
- It's 'Catch the thief'!
- It's a catch the thief game!

543
00:27:35,895 --> 00:27:38,832
[Catch the thief - Find the
person who is hiding an extra card.]

544
00:27:38,832 --> 00:27:40,865
<i>We used to play this a lot in the past.</i>

545
00:27:40,866 --> 00:27:42,149
<i>As you can see...</i>

546
00:27:42,150 --> 00:27:45,778
<i> there are four jjampong cards,
and there's one jajangmyun card.</i>

547
00:27:45,779 --> 00:27:47,026
[Four jjampong and one jajangmyun card]

548
00:27:47,027 --> 00:27:53,101
<i>Take these five cards and decide which one
of you will hold on to the jajangmyun card.</i>

549
00:27:53,102 --> 00:27:56,613
<i>And for the next five minutes precisely,
you're allowed to ask each other questions.</i>

550
00:27:56,614 --> 00:27:58,147
<i>And when the five minutes are up</i>

551
00:27:58,148 --> 00:28:01,999
<i>you will each guess who on the other team
has the jajangmyun card simultaneously.</i>

552
00:28:02,151 --> 00:28:05,038
<i>We will start with the Singer Team
since they arrived first.</i>

553
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:09,172
<i>The team to guess who has it
twice in a row is the winner.</i>

554
00:28:10,659 --> 00:28:12,966
- First, just don't give it to Kwang Soo.
- Okay.

555
00:28:13,468 --> 00:28:15,254
[Giraffe has no poker face.]

556
00:28:15,255 --> 00:28:17,185
Kwang Soo really is a horrible liar.

557
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:19,869
- Okay, you take the card.
- Thank you.

558
00:28:19,869 --> 00:28:23,441
[Does Team Leader Hwang
really have the jajangmyun card?]

559
00:28:23,442 --> 00:28:25,189
- I guarantee he doesn't have it.
- No, he really could have the card.

560
00:28:25,190 --> 00:28:26,395
No, he doesn't have the card.

561
00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:30,575
Sung Woong, you can have a jjampong card.

562
00:28:33,621 --> 00:28:37,748
[Just which one of them has
the jajangmyun card?]

563
00:28:37,749 --> 00:28:41,234
Since they're all actors,
I'm sure they'll all be good at acting.

564
00:28:41,235 --> 00:28:42,557
[Their opponents are actors!
This may not be an easy feat...]

565
00:28:44,623 --> 00:28:49,013
<i>Okay, we will start the clock now.
If you're ready... set, go!</i>

566
00:28:49,404 --> 00:28:51,474
[Five minutes for questioning starts now!]

567
00:28:51,475 --> 00:28:53,952
It's not Jung Min.
He's being too obvious about it.

568
00:28:53,953 --> 00:28:57,329
- Did you see what I saw?
- He's shaking his leg really hard over here.

569
00:28:57,330 --> 00:28:59,162
Before they stuck up their cards...

570
00:28:59,528 --> 00:29:02,973
Sung Woong was the only one who was holding
tightly onto it like it was really important.

571
00:29:02,974 --> 00:29:04,274
[Could Sung Woong have the card?]

572
00:29:07,518 --> 00:29:09,686
I was doing that just so
that you don't find out what I have.

573
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:13,334
I put everything I have on
Park Sung Woong having the card.

574
00:29:13,764 --> 00:29:15,175
I don't think it's him.

575
00:29:15,176 --> 00:29:18,496
I'm not going to ask any questions,
but I'm going to look with my mind.

576
00:29:18,497 --> 00:29:20,940
[Team Leader Kkuk...
you're going to see with your mind?]

577
00:29:21,982 --> 00:29:25,497
- My young fans know what they're saying.
- Let's not be like that.

578
00:29:25,497 --> 00:29:26,672
Why don't we just ask the questions?

579
00:29:26,673 --> 00:29:29,057
I think we'll find out who it is
once we all each ask a question.

580
00:29:29,058 --> 00:29:32,082
- Kwang Soo, it's not you, is it?
- Kwang Soo... you're jajang, aren't you?

581
00:29:32,083 --> 00:29:33,357
No.

582
00:29:33,358 --> 00:29:35,149
- What do you mean, you're not?
- Ji Hyo, you're jajang, aren't you?

583
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:36,477
No.

584
00:29:36,478 --> 00:29:38,265
- Jae Suk, you're jajang, aren't you?
- Yes.

585
00:29:38,266 --> 00:29:39,276
Yes.

586
00:29:40,674 --> 00:29:43,126
[Jae Suk confessing to having jajang?]

587
00:29:43,127 --> 00:29:44,315
You know it's not him!

588
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:46,010
[Jae Suk's psychological game
throwing everyone into confusion.]

589
00:29:46,010 --> 00:29:47,331
I have the jajang card.

590
00:29:47,332 --> 00:29:49,791
- Wait, think about this...
- I have the card, why?

591
00:29:51,255 --> 00:29:52,522
Wait, we need to think about this.

592
00:29:52,523 --> 00:29:53,873
Jung Min, you're jajang, aren't you?

593
00:29:56,415 --> 00:29:57,828
<i>It's not Jung Min.</i>

594
00:29:57,829 --> 00:29:59,331
- Look at how relaxed he is.
- No, it's not him.

595
00:29:59,332 --> 00:30:02,667
For sure it's not Kwang Soo or Jung Min.
Look at Jung Min's face.

596
00:30:02,668 --> 00:30:04,393
My face is just red to begin with.

597
00:30:05,041 --> 00:30:07,093
[Impossible to remain poker faced
with his already red face.]

598
00:30:07,887 --> 00:30:11,924
- I really think it's Ji Hyo.
- Gut instincts are always right.

599
00:30:11,925 --> 00:30:14,512
Gut instincts are always right.
It's Sung Woong for sure.

600
00:30:14,513 --> 00:30:16,188
- I'm telling you, it's him.
- No, it's not Sung Woong!

601
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:19,463
- He just always look stone faced!
- I'm telling you, he has the card.

602
00:30:20,238 --> 00:30:22,568
- What about Ji Hyo?
- It's not Ji Hyo.

603
00:30:22,569 --> 00:30:24,163
I can tell by looking at her face,
and it's not Ji Hyo.

604
00:30:24,164 --> 00:30:26,503
I can guarantee that it's not
Jung Min or Kwang Soo.

605
00:30:26,504 --> 00:30:28,024
How can you be so sure?

606
00:30:28,292 --> 00:30:30,847
- I'll bet my life on it.
- I think it's Jae Suk.

607
00:30:30,848 --> 00:30:31,998
You think life can be taken so lightly?

608
00:30:31,999 --> 00:30:34,175
- Are you being serious?
- Jung Min is so funny!

609
00:30:34,175 --> 00:30:37,714
Can you bet your fortune on it?

610
00:30:37,715 --> 00:30:39,488
Me? Of course, I can bet that.

611
00:30:40,428 --> 00:30:41,998
Me? Of course, I can bet that.

612
00:30:41,999 --> 00:30:43,692
[Are his lips quivering?]

613
00:30:43,693 --> 00:30:46,334
[His lips quiver at the mention
of betting his whole life's savings.]

614
00:30:46,335 --> 00:30:48,469
- Did you see his lips quivering?
- Are you jajang or jjampong?

615
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:50,996
- Are you jajang or jjampong?
- Which one do you want me to say?

616
00:30:52,306 --> 00:30:54,384
[What does that mean...]

617
00:30:55,585 --> 00:30:57,990
Just tell them what you have
instead of saying things like that.

618
00:30:57,991 --> 00:30:59,165
<i> What are you talking about?</i>

619
00:30:59,166 --> 00:31:01,897
This could suddenly change
into sweet and sour pork.

620
00:31:03,501 --> 00:31:05,515
- It could be Jae Suk.
- No, it's not Jae Suk.

621
00:31:05,515 --> 00:31:06,619
[Which one of them has the jajang?]

622
00:31:06,619 --> 00:31:09,136
- The way I see it...
- It's definitely nor Kwang Soo or Jung Min.

623
00:31:09,136 --> 00:31:10,607
[I'm telling you, it's me.]

624
00:31:10,608 --> 00:31:14,203
Trust me on this, I know I'm right.
It's either Park Sung Woong or Song Ji Hyo.

625
00:31:14,204 --> 00:31:15,852
- It's one of those two.
- I'm telling you, it's not.

626
00:31:15,853 --> 00:31:19,515
- Why is it that no one is suspecting Ji Hyo?
- She was just saying that it was Ji Hyo.

627
00:31:25,001 --> 00:31:26,872
[Suspicious...]

628
00:31:26,873 --> 00:31:28,976
Why are you saying useless things
like that?

629
00:31:28,977 --> 00:31:31,245
- It's Ji Hyo, isn't it?
- It must be Ji Hyo.

630
00:31:32,247 --> 00:31:34,057
- It's Ji Hyo...
- Song Ji Hyo?

631
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:36,765
- I think it's Song Ji Hyo...
- It's Ji Hyo!

632
00:31:36,766 --> 00:31:38,610
[Does Ji Hyo really have the jajang card?]

633
00:31:39,028 --> 00:31:41,084
[Or is it poker-faced Sung Woong?]

634
00:31:41,084 --> 00:31:42,864
[Or could it be Jae Suk?]

635
00:31:43,096 --> 00:31:44,688
- It's Ji Hyo!
- No, it's Park Sung Woong.

636
00:31:44,689 --> 00:31:45,747
It's Ji Hyo!

637
00:31:45,747 --> 00:31:47,690
[Is it really Ji Hyo?]

638
00:31:47,690 --> 00:31:50,874
[Or is it Kwang Soo's mind trick?]

639
00:31:50,875 --> 00:31:54,001
<i>- It's Ji Hyo... it's Ji Hyo!
- No, it's Park Sung Woong.</i>

640
00:31:54,002 --> 00:31:55,593
I'm telling you, I'm clairvoyant!

641
00:31:55,594 --> 00:31:59,000
Even if it's not her, I'm sure that
Jae Suk isn't going to get picked.

642
00:31:59,001 --> 00:32:01,959
[Are they going to choose Ji Hyo since
Hyuna and Jong Kook are convinced it's her?]

643
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:04,375
- No, no... it's Jung Min!
- It's Ji Hyo!

644
00:32:04,376 --> 00:32:05,857
[Conflicting opinions]

645
00:32:05,858 --> 00:32:08,393
- I'm telling you, it's Jung Min!
- No, it's Sung Woong!

646
00:32:08,394 --> 00:32:12,487
[Singer Team's pick is... Song Ji Hyo.]

647
00:32:13,551 --> 00:32:16,485
<i>Song Ji Hyo,
please turn your card around.</i>

648
00:32:16,486 --> 00:32:19,034
- I'm telling you, it's Jung Min.
- No, it's not him.

649
00:32:19,035 --> 00:32:21,688
- I'm telling you, you guys are wrong.
- I think it's Sung Woong.

650
00:32:21,689 --> 00:32:24,633
- Sung Woong is just really good at acting.
- You picked Song Ji Hyo.

651
00:32:24,634 --> 00:32:26,643
I don't think Ji Hyo is good at lying.

652
00:32:28,142 --> 00:32:30,426
[Just what...]

653
00:32:30,426 --> 00:32:34,837
[Is the card that she has?]

654
00:32:37,061 --> 00:32:39,702
[Jajangmyun!]

655
00:32:42,090 --> 00:32:44,776
[Singer Team succeeds in ferreting out
the holder of the jajang card!]

656
00:32:44,777 --> 00:32:47,600
I told you that I could see!
I told you I was clairvoyant!

657
00:32:47,601 --> 00:32:49,937
Why did you have to say that earlier?

658
00:32:50,352 --> 00:32:53,405
- You and your mouth...
- No, that's not what I meant...

659
00:32:53,406 --> 00:32:56,379
What were you thinking?
Why did you say that?

660
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:58,013
[Getting blasted with their scolding.]

661
00:32:58,396 --> 00:33:01,827
- Me saying that wasn't...
- He knew because of what you said.

662
00:33:01,828 --> 00:33:05,553
- Why did you have to say that?
- What I said wasn't a factor.

663
00:33:06,222 --> 00:33:08,631
Wait... wait, wait...
Kwang Soo, get out of here.

664
00:33:09,486 --> 00:33:10,805
Kwang Soo, get out of here.

665
00:33:10,806 --> 00:33:12,643
[Outside?]

666
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:15,932
Kwang Soo, you're on our side, aren't you?

667
00:33:15,933 --> 00:33:17,435
Kwang Soo, X-man...

668
00:33:17,925 --> 00:33:21,518
- Stop talking about each other's faults.
- Is there X-man in this game?

669
00:33:21,518 --> 00:33:23,399
- Is there?
- No, there isn't.

670
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:27,403
[X-man? Doesn't that mean... a spy?]

671
00:33:28,413 --> 00:33:33,226
- We're only down to four men now.
- It's all because of you!

672
00:33:33,227 --> 00:33:36,679
- No, it's not because of that.
- Why did you have to say that about Ji Hyo?

673
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:40,618
- Yeah, why did you have to say that?
- Hyuna was the only person who thought that.

674
00:33:40,619 --> 00:33:43,979
Didn't you see how Suk Jin kept telling
Hyuna it wasn't Ji Hyo?

675
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:47,813
So you should've just kept quiet, but you...
Just don't do that from now on.

676
00:33:50,893 --> 00:33:53,897
I keep getting framed as a troublemaker
even if I do good...

677
00:33:53,898 --> 00:33:56,732
You're not even a maker.
You're just trouble.

678
00:33:58,963 --> 00:34:00,930
Maker is too nice of a word for you.

679
00:34:00,931 --> 00:34:02,954
[Giraffe trouble]

680
00:34:04,828 --> 00:34:08,369
Let's not pass it out one by one,
and just mix it up instead.

681
00:34:08,370 --> 00:34:11,104
[Singer Team's plan is
to just play it randomly.]

682
00:34:11,105 --> 00:34:13,395
- Okay.
- So we don't even know who has it.

683
00:34:15,521 --> 00:34:17,730
- We should've done that too.
- Just mix it all up.

684
00:34:17,731 --> 00:34:20,406
- So we don't even know who gets it.
- Pass it from the bottom so they can't see.

685
00:34:20,407 --> 00:34:23,162
[Just who will end up with
the jajang card?]

686
00:34:23,162 --> 00:34:26,420
- You can usually sense who it is.
- I'm not even going to look at my card.

687
00:34:26,715 --> 00:34:29,615
- I can be too obvious about it.
- Start!

688
00:34:29,616 --> 00:34:31,746
[Five minutes of questioning starts now!]

689
00:34:32,536 --> 00:34:34,656
I shouldn't even look at what I have.

690
00:34:34,657 --> 00:34:38,721
- I don't think it's Ha Ha. Ha Ha is out.
- I don't think its Hyuna either.

691
00:34:38,722 --> 00:34:40,066
Kwang Soo, you stay quiet.

692
00:34:41,075 --> 00:34:42,878
Is it okay to be excluded
from playing the game?

693
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:47,829
- Kang Gary, are you jajang?
- Yeah, I'm jajang.

694
00:34:49,218 --> 00:34:50,268
What?

695
00:34:50,627 --> 00:34:53,825
Ji Hyo... does just looking at Gary
make you that happy?

696
00:34:54,844 --> 00:34:56,779
- Why are you just asking me?
- Do you like him that much?

697
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:58,304
Did you not wash your face today?

698
00:35:01,664 --> 00:35:04,427
- Why don't you wash it for me then?
- Why would I wash your face for you?

699
00:35:04,428 --> 00:35:07,437
- Why would I do that? Why?
- You can just wash it for me then.

700
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:09,418
Wash your face in the morning.
I can tell that it looks dirty.

701
00:35:09,419 --> 00:35:11,802
I was going for the tough look today!

702
00:35:12,174 --> 00:35:15,047
You're going to ruin
his image as a celebrity...

703
00:35:16,259 --> 00:35:17,712
Ugh, I'm so mad!

704
00:35:19,252 --> 00:35:21,338
- I think it's Gary.
- Why?

705
00:35:21,339 --> 00:35:23,446
When Gary was doing this...

706
00:35:23,793 --> 00:35:26,491
Jong Kook grabbed his card
while looking from the side.

[As the tablecloth moved...]

708
00:35:29,725 --> 00:35:31,572
[Team Leader Kkuk made a move.]

709
00:35:32,028 --> 00:35:34,102
- The way he grabbed the card...
- It was because the cloth was moving.

710
00:35:34,103 --> 00:35:36,826
- I was just trying to stop it from moving.
- You're speaking with a bit of anger.

711
00:35:36,827 --> 00:35:40,069
- Suk Jin is jajang!
- Jajang, my butt...

712
00:35:40,070 --> 00:35:42,682
Suk Jin... you're not...
you're not jajang, are you?

713
00:35:43,258 --> 00:35:44,920
- Huh?
- You're not jajang, right?

714
00:35:44,921 --> 00:35:46,222
Not jajang?

715

his reflexes gets twisted around.]

[What am I talking about?]

717
00:35:54,618 --> 00:35:57,487
- Not jajang, right?
- Ask me normally.

718
00:35:57,488 --> 00:35:59,956
- You should say, you're jajang, right?
- You're not jajang, are you?

719
00:36:00,727 --> 00:36:02,619
Jajang... no, I'm not.

720
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:05,897
- Kang Gary, you're jajang, right?
- I'm definitely jajang.

721

I'll be jajang the day after that too.

- No, it's not!

- Kang Gary!
-Yeah, I'm jajang.

726

- I know... it may be him.

727

- Hyuna, are you jajang?
- Yes.

728
00:36:24,039 --> 00:36:26,398
- I can't figure her out.
- I don't think it's her.

729
00:36:26,399 --> 00:36:28,725
Are you saying that you can't
figure out her heart?

730
00:36:30,368 --> 00:36:32,517
What are you trying to do right now?

731
00:36:32,518 --> 00:36:34,217

- Yes.

[More interested in Hyuna's heart
rather than finding out who's jajang?]

- Didn't you think he was good at faking?

- Sounds good.

It's actually better to be out early
since I can't even act.

802
00:39:59,954 --> 00:40:01,304
- Hyuna says she knows.
- You know?

803
00:40:01,305 --> 00:40:04,218
- He has jajang.
- He's jajang?

804
00:40:04,913 --> 00:40:06,916
[Is Jung Min jajang?]

805
00:40:06,917 --> 00:40:09,816
- I'm 100% sure. He has jajang card.
- She says she's 100% sure.

806
00:40:09,817 --> 00:40:12,842
- Can you look at us in the face?
- I'm telling you, it's not me.

807
00:40:12,843 --> 00:40:14,511
[Singer Team feeling sure
that Jung Min is the jajang card holder.]

808
00:40:14,512 --> 00:40:17,193
- You're jajang, aren't you?
- I'm jjampong.

809
00:40:17,194 --> 00:40:18,503
He's definitely jajang!

810
00:40:18,504 --> 00:40:20,599
No! No, I'm not!

811
00:40:21,388 --> 00:40:24,515
[100% convinced that Jung Min is jajang!]

812
00:40:26,768 --> 00:40:28,770
- Listen to Hyuna.
- Listen to me.

813
00:40:29,078 --> 00:40:33,570
In the midst of all this chaos...
Kwang Soo is staying way too quiet.

814
00:40:33,571 --> 00:40:34,872
[Suspecting silent Kwang Soo?]

815
00:40:34,873 --> 00:40:36,645
I've been talking nonstop.

816
00:40:37,618 --> 00:40:40,470
Kwang Soo's not smiling like
he usually does.

817
00:40:40,471 --> 00:40:42,370
He's been doing that ever since
we called out who has the jajang card.

818
00:40:42,371 --> 00:40:44,130
Close your eyes.
We're going to try the same thing.

819
00:40:44,131 --> 00:40:45,686
- What?
- Close your eyes.

820
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:50,410
Raise your hand if you have
the jajang card.

821
00:40:50,411 --> 00:40:52,915
- One, two, three.
- Kwang Soo, raise your hand.

822
00:40:52,916 --> 00:40:55,193
You're the only one who hasn't raised it.
Your hand is the only one down.

823
00:40:57,334 --> 00:40:59,194
[Slowly raising his hand.]

824
00:40:59,194 --> 00:41:01,966
Kwang Soo!
I know Kwang Soo very well.

825
00:41:01,967 --> 00:41:03,802
- It's not Kwang Soo.
- No, it's definitely him.

826
00:41:03,803 --> 00:41:05,294
- I'm telling you, it's Kwang Soo.
- No, it's Jung Min.

827
00:41:05,295 --> 00:41:07,457
You all know how well I
know Kwang Soo.

828
00:41:07,458 --> 00:41:10,812
- No one has suspected Jae Suk once.
- It's Kwang Soo!

829
00:41:10,813 --> 00:41:13,564
I will show you just how
clairvoyant I really am with this.

830
00:41:13,565 --> 00:41:15,729
- Are you serious?
- It's Jung Min...

831
00:41:15,730 --> 00:41:17,173
- I'm telling you, it's Kwang Soo.
- You're not jajang, are you?

832
00:41:17,591 --> 00:41:20,426
- I'm not jajang.
- See? It's Kwang Soo! Look at his face!

833
00:41:20,427 --> 00:41:22,616
- It is. Look at his face! It's him.
- I think it is Kwang Soo.

834
00:41:22,617 --> 00:41:24,699
It's Kwang Soo.
I'm positive it's him.

835
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:26,390
- Let's go with him.
- I think it's Kwang Soo.

836
00:41:26,391 --> 00:41:29,186
- It hasn't been five minutes yet though.
- We'll say it now though.

837
00:41:29,187 --> 00:41:31,699
- It's not him...
- You should use what's left of the time.

838
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:33,302
No, no... it's okay.

839
00:41:33,637 --> 00:41:37,615
- One, two, three!
- Kwang Soo.

840
00:41:37,616 --> 00:41:39,846
[Singer Team's selection is...
Lee Kwang Soo.]

841
00:41:39,846 --> 00:41:42,841
- I don't think it's him.
- I think it's Sung Woong!

842
00:41:42,842 --> 00:41:45,668
- It's Kwang Soo. I'm sure of it.
- One, two, three!

843
00:41:45,669 --> 00:41:47,396
I'm telling you, I think it's Sung Woong.

844
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:52,104
[Wow... jajangmyun!]

845
00:41:53,294 --> 00:41:55,811
- Hyuna...
- How did they know that?

846
00:41:56,646 --> 00:41:58,921
- How did they know that?
- How did you know that?

847
00:41:59,449 --> 00:42:01,702
I can understand why no one
trusts you with anything now.

848
00:42:03,782 --> 00:42:06,364
[His blood pressure on the rise
because of Kwang Soo?]

849
00:42:06,365 --> 00:42:07,606
He should've been saying something.

850
00:42:07,607 --> 00:42:09,566
I get yelled at for talking,
and I get yelled at when I don't talk.

851
00:42:09,567 --> 00:42:12,368
- Why were you staying so quiet?
- Jong Kook having known him so long...

852
00:42:12,369 --> 00:42:14,686
[Is this really...
Team Leader Kkuk's clairvoyance?]

853
00:42:14,686 --> 00:42:16,534
They're guessing everything right today.

854
00:42:16,535 --> 00:42:18,433
How did they guess so well?

855
00:42:18,434 --> 00:42:21,258
[Does he have clairvoyant abilities now?]

856
00:42:21,259 --> 00:42:22,618

This time...

863
00:42:46,563 --> 00:42:49,754
Since we kept saying it's not Kwang Soo,
he may have given it to him.

864
00:42:50,414 --> 00:42:53,637
- I don't think it's Kwang Soo.
- Sung Woong...

865
00:42:57,325 --> 00:42:58,495
Jae Suk?

866
00:42:59,676 --> 00:43:01,210

867
00:43:01,734 --> 00:43:02,959
Kwang Soo?

868

[Nodding her head right away
at the mention of Kwang Soo's name.]

are commendably good.]

given out so far...]

[And the last bag is hidden
around here somewhere.]

894
00:44:37,132 --> 00:44:41,356
Then, since we know where four are, and
they know two, we have to steal the location?

895
00:44:41,457 --> 00:44:43,953
The cards we have show there are two in
the education building and two in the main.

896

Not the educational building, but the one
in the green environmental cabinet.

the bag in the main building first.]

bags should be here somewhere.]

in the hint card.]

go over to the educational building?

916

- Make sure you don't get it taken away.
- I understand.

920

Once you find the bag, don't do anything
and just bring it back to us first.

[Actor Team safely getting back together
as a team in the main building.]

963
00:48:48,969 --> 00:48:52,020
The important this is, seeing how they don't
have any bags in their hand

964
00:48:52,021 --> 00:48:53,899
I'm sure they have it hidden away
somewhere. Don't you think?

965
00:48:53,899 --> 00:48:55,515
I'm 100% sure they have them
hidden somewhere.

966

[Actor Team trying to hide
the second bag somewhere.]

967
00:48:59,518 --> 00:49:01,412
I'll go hide it then.

968
00:49:01,413 --> 00:49:04,385
I'll go hide it in the area where
we hid the first bag.

969
00:49:04,386 --> 00:49:05,816
They're not going to be able to find it.

970
00:49:08,050 --> 00:49:11,925
[They're convinced that the bags Singer Team
found are hidden in the other building.]

971
00:49:11,925 --> 00:49:14,216
Jung Min, let's go there and find it.

972
00:49:14,488 --> 00:49:19,114
[Go to the educational building to steal the
bags away from the Singer Team!]

973
00:49:19,115 --> 00:49:20,277

the other bag is already hidden...]

975

[Should I just secretly take these
over to Jong Kook?]

976
00:49:47,002 --> 00:49:49,224
- Did you wrap it up?
- Yes, but you really scared me.

977
00:49:49,615 --> 00:49:51,708
[Sung Woong heads in her direction!]

978
00:49:51,709 --> 00:49:52,888
You really scared me.

979
00:49:52,889 --> 00:49:55,596
The rest of the guys went over to the other
building to steal their bags.

980
00:49:55,597 --> 00:49:56,915
Really?

981
00:49:56,916 --> 00:50:00,497
[Right now doesn't seem like a
good time to be making my moves...]

982

[Concealing their second bag in
the same manner as their first.]

983
00:50:12,619 --> 00:50:16,931
[Okay... so both the bags are going to be
hidden in here, is that it?]

984
00:50:17,993 --> 00:50:20,724
[On the other hand, the Actor Team arrives
in the other building for the ambush attack.]

985
00:50:20,725 --> 00:50:23,755
- Should we look around here too?
- I bet those are good hiding spots.

986
00:50:24,417 --> 00:50:28,702
[Searching for the bags that
the Singer Team hid away.]

for the hidden bags...]

988

[It's Jung Min!]

989
00:50:52,121 --> 00:50:53,515
<i>Yes, Jung Min.</i>

990
00:50:53,516 --> 00:50:55,826
Where did you hide the bags
in the education building?

991
00:50:56,612 --> 00:51:02,342
There's a studio in some sort of classroom
on the first floor and it's in there.

992
00:51:02,776 --> 00:51:04,160
Where in the studio?

993
00:51:04,161 --> 00:51:09,004
If you go in there, you'll find a studio.
And when you go into the studio...

994
00:51:12,081 --> 00:51:14,217

Jung Min, don't hang up!</i>

995

996
00:51:16,238 --> 00:51:17,361
Jung Min...

997
00:51:21,358 --> 00:51:22,949
<i>Any problems over there?</i>

998
00:51:23,987 --> 00:51:26,867
- Who were you talking to?
- Huh?

999
00:51:26,868 --> 00:51:28,701
- My wife. It was my wife.
- Huh?

1000
00:51:31,223 --> 00:51:33,203
My wife called...

1001
00:51:33,204 --> 00:51:35,074
- I thought you said you weren't answering...
- What?

1002
00:51:35,074 --> 00:51:39,054
[Earlier in the day, he was talking about how
he doesn't answer his wife's calls often...]

1003
00:51:39,623 --> 00:51:42,750
- Who were you on the phone with?
- I told you, it was my wife.

1004
00:51:44,482 --> 00:51:46,976
It won't... someone else?

1005
00:51:46,977 --> 00:51:48,440
Where are you?

1006
00:51:51,922 --> 00:51:52,935
Huh?

1007
00:51:54,843 --> 00:51:57,091
[Something feels funny...]

1008
00:51:58,536 --> 00:51:59,734
<i>Hello?</i>

1009
00:52:02,223 --> 00:52:07,035
[This is driving me crazy... why are
things getting so twisted around?]

1010
00:52:08,838 --> 00:52:10,112
Sung Woong...

1011
00:52:10,113 --> 00:52:13,395
- Go ahead.
- Oh, there you are. Okay.

1012
00:52:14,113 --> 00:52:15,855
Kwang Soo, I don't see anything here.

1013
00:52:17,834 --> 00:52:20,351
- Jung Min is acting weird.
- Why?

1014
00:52:23,072 --> 00:52:25,515
He was talking on his phone
in hiding.

1015
00:52:26,272 --> 00:52:27,992
Was he just calling his wife?

1016
00:52:28,548 --> 00:52:31,675
- That's what he said...
- Yeah?

1017
00:52:32,792 --> 00:52:36,216
But earlier, he was talking about how he
doesn't answer calls from his wife...

1018
00:52:38,060 --> 00:52:42,535
[These two who's suspicion of Jung Min
is growing deeper by the second.]

1019
00:52:44,401 --> 00:52:46,394
<i>What? I'm searching around
right now.</i>

1020
00:52:46,395 --> 00:52:48,623
When I started to get suspicious...

1021
00:52:50,752 --> 00:52:53,805
he said, 'Yes, Ji Hyo' into the walkie talkie
even though there was no one talking.

1022
00:52:54,037 --> 00:52:56,379
No, Ji Hyo was talking earlier.

1023
00:52:56,427 --> 00:52:57,652
I...

1024
00:52:57,653 --> 00:53:01,242
I have nothing to say anymore.
If this is how it's going to stay...

1025
00:53:01,243 --> 00:53:03,398
How are we going to beat a spy
if there is one?

1026
00:53:04,021 --> 00:53:06,973
Come on... there's no way
Jung Min could be a spy.

1027
00:53:07,532 --> 00:53:10,346
We can't just ignore all these clues.

1028
00:53:10,585 --> 00:53:14,368
Your useless thoughts like these
complicate everything.

1029
00:53:14,369 --> 00:53:17,621
Just go and find the hidden bags...
who knows where they have them hidden?

1030
00:53:17,992 --> 00:53:19,828
- Where could they be?
- You'll regret this later.

1031
00:53:19,829 --> 00:53:21,756
You're going to wish that you
listened to me when that time comes.

1032
00:53:22,097 --> 00:53:25,304
You're going to ask me how Jung Min
could've done what he did later on.

1033
00:53:27,742 --> 00:53:31,696
[Jung Min arrives at the studio as
he's been instructed by Gary.]

1034

Gary's information!]

1038

[Now he has to secretly get them back
to where their bags are hidden...]

1039
00:54:07,810 --> 00:54:11,559
[Caught by the Singer Team!]

1040
00:54:12,091 --> 00:54:13,732
- What's wrong?
- He has the bags!

1041
00:54:13,733 --> 00:54:15,760
- He took the bags!
- Move... move!

1042
00:54:22,465 --> 00:54:25,661
[Ah... he almost succeeded...]

1043
00:54:30,297 --> 00:54:32,944
How did he find those?
Wait... I bet we have a spy.

1044
00:54:32,945 --> 00:54:34,615
- You think there's a spy?
- I'm sure there's a spy.

1045
00:54:35,636 --> 00:54:38,108
I think I know who the spy is.

1046
00:54:38,109 --> 00:54:39,538
I think it's Gary.

1047
00:54:40,830 --> 00:54:45,653
[I knew there's a spy within
our team too!]

1048

1049
00:54:48,776 --> 00:54:51,229
[For now, Jung Min is like a mouse
caught in a mouse trap.]

1050

<i>Yes, Jung Min?</i>

1051
00:54:52,724 --> 00:54:55,490
I'm trapped right now.

1052
00:54:55,763 --> 00:55:00,045
Right now, I'm... I'm um...
unable to get out because I'm trapped.

1053
00:55:00,583 --> 00:55:02,836
<i>Why are you trapped?</i>

1054
00:55:02,837 --> 00:55:06,915
Since all these guys are blocking me in,
come here and help me out.

1055
00:55:06,916 --> 00:55:08,457
Just listen to me. Hurry.

1056

- Yes?

1057
00:55:11,303 --> 00:55:12,717

- You just wait there.</i>

let's work something out.</i>

1059
00:55:15,277 --> 00:55:16,512
What would you like to work out?

1060
00:55:17,478 --> 00:55:19,739
If you give the bags back to us,
we'll let you live.

1061
00:55:19,740 --> 00:55:22,234
If you give the bags back to us,
we won't rip off your name tag.

1062

- Jong Kook...
- Yes, Jung Min?

1063
00:55:23,945 --> 00:55:26,026
Just send in Suk Jin for now.

1064
00:55:26,798 --> 00:55:30,166
Come on, Jung Min...
You're being too obvious right now.

1065
00:55:30,167 --> 00:55:32,705
It's because I can't match your
strength if I had to face you.

1066
00:55:32,706 --> 00:55:36,168
It's not like that... we'll give you our word.
We locked the outer door too.

1067
00:55:36,169 --> 00:55:38,234
So no one will be able to get
in here anyway.

1068

<i>You have to open your door
for the outer door to open.</i>

1069
00:55:40,350 --> 00:55:43,658
I don't need that. If I really needed to,
I can get out through the ceiling.

1070
00:55:44,254 --> 00:55:47,142
Jung Min... why would you go
through the roof?

1071
00:55:47,143 --> 00:55:50,401
- Why don't you just...
- Why don't you give up the bags first?

1072
00:55:50,402 --> 00:55:52,920
- You'll have another chance.
- Okay.

1073

<i>- Just give us the bags.
- Just give us the bags.</i>

1074

Just give us the bags.
Give us both the bags.

1075
00:55:59,858 --> 00:56:02,006
Give us one... and the other.

1076
00:56:02,007 --> 00:56:03,634

- Give us the other one.

to get out too.

1087

- It's too hot in here.

1121
00:59:02,476 --> 00:59:04,474
Is it not in here?
Oh! There they are!

1122
00:59:07,841 --> 00:59:08,914
Awesome.

1123
00:59:11,294 --> 00:59:14,919
[Steals two of the Singer Team's bags!]

1124
00:59:15,709 --> 00:59:19,421
[Lucky that he caught a glimpse earlier
when he opened the door.]

1125
00:59:21,091 --> 00:59:24,915
[Moving the recently found bags
to a third new location.]

1126
00:59:25,667 --> 00:59:28,146
[Concealing it in the closet of
the 747 simulation plane.]

1127
00:59:29,380 --> 00:59:32,138
- Jung Min, it's Ji Hyo.
- Let's go find Ji Hyo.

1128
00:59:32,820 --> 00:59:34,271
<i>We're coming, Ji Hyo.</i>

1129
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:39,730
[Jung Min gathers Sung Woong
and Ji Hyo around...]

1130
00:59:41,212 --> 00:59:45,581
I... planted a spy on the other team.

1131
00:59:45,582 --> 00:59:48,176
- I planted a spy over there.
- Really?

1132
00:59:49,659 --> 00:59:53,458
[Ji Hyo didn't think in her wildest dreams
that there would be a spy on the other team.]

1133
00:59:53,459 --> 00:59:56,077
[Ji Hyo acting as though
she doesn't know anything!]

1134
00:59:56,078 --> 00:59:57,602
The spy is helping us out.

1135
00:59:58,961 --> 01:00:03,079
It means that there's without a doubt
a spy planted on our side too.

1136
01:00:04,020 --> 01:00:07,235
- You're right.
- That's what Kwang Soo...

1137
01:00:07,236 --> 01:00:12,633
[Jung Min is suspecting Kwang Soo
to be the spy amongst them.]

1138
01:00:12,634 --> 01:00:13,979
That's why I haven't told him anything.

1139
01:00:13,980 --> 01:00:18,483
[Jung Min not telling Kwang Soo about
where the bags are hidden...]

1140
01:00:18,484 --> 01:00:20,749
Since I'm telling you,
we can't tell Kwang Soo and Jae Suk.

1141
01:00:20,750 --> 01:00:21,970
- Understand what I'm saying?
- I understand.

1142
01:00:21,971 --> 01:00:23,684
You're not the spy, are you?

1143
01:00:24,851 --> 01:00:27,108
- How can I be the spy?
- You're a spy in your movie.

1144
01:00:28,990 --> 01:00:32,763
Hearing you say that...
that's really making me sad.

1145
01:00:32,764 --> 01:00:34,733
I'm telling you, I'm not the spy.

1146
01:00:48,914 --> 01:00:52,985
[Must meet up with Jong Kook!]

1147
01:00:54,180 --> 01:00:55,672
<i>Jung Min...</i>

1148
01:00:55,673 --> 01:00:57,924
<i>Tell us where you hid our bags.</i>

1149
01:00:59,134 --> 01:01:00,460
Just wait a little bit longer.

1150
01:01:01,281 --> 01:01:04,993
[Jung Min not telling them anything due to
his suspicion of Jae Suk and Kwang Soo.]

1151
01:01:04,994 --> 01:01:06,767
What have you been doing?

1152
01:01:07,085 --> 01:01:09,666
I'm a spy... I wanted to
tell Jung Min that I'm not it...

1153
01:01:10,299 --> 01:01:12,317
[Huh?]

1154
01:01:12,318 --> 01:01:14,727
I've already told Jung Min
that I'm not the spy.

1155
01:01:14,728 --> 01:01:18,072
Why would you have to convince us
that you're not the spy?

1156
01:01:18,073 --> 01:01:21,310
The other team could've planted
a spy on our team too.

1157
01:01:21,311 --> 01:01:23,226
- So you're saying that it's not you?
- That's right.

1158
01:01:24,505 --> 01:01:27,589
How could you... anyone
can see that you're not the spy.

1159
01:01:27,590 --> 01:01:30,523
- We know you're not the spy.
- Really?

1160
01:01:31,123 --> 01:01:34,623
Can the same team...
Can your own teammate rip this off?

1161
01:01:35,222 --> 01:01:36,964
- Sure, you can.
- Really?

1162
01:01:36,965 --> 01:01:38,829
There are a few who's name tags
I'd like to rip off.

1163
01:01:38,830 --> 01:01:40,835
- There are a few?
- Or maybe just two.

1164
01:01:40,836 --> 01:01:42,850
- There are just two.
- Seriously...

1165
01:01:43,249 --> 01:01:47,759
- Seriously...
- In my opinion, the bags...

1166
01:01:49,438 --> 01:01:53,514
It's not just your opinion,
but the bags belong to our whole team.

1167
01:01:53,515 --> 01:01:55,601
- Hand over the bags.
- Hand them over. Where are they?

1168
01:01:55,602 --> 01:01:57,677
- Hurry up and tell us.
- Where are they?

1169
01:01:57,678 --> 01:01:59,216
- Why are you playing around?
- They're not here.

1170
01:01:59,217 --> 01:02:01,334
Why aren't you telling us
where they're at?

1171
01:02:01,335 --> 01:02:03,523
Since the day I was born,
I wouldn't tell anyone about the location.

1172
01:02:04,219 --> 01:02:06,159
[What does that mean?]

1173
01:02:07,289 --> 01:02:11,039
[Of all the excuses they've ever heard...]

1174
01:02:11,715 --> 01:02:14,804
But why are you so desperate
to find out where the bags are?

1175
01:02:14,805 --> 01:02:16,369
There you go starting again.

1176
01:02:16,889 --> 01:02:18,679
You think I'm the spy?

1177
01:02:18,680 --> 01:02:21,340
It's possible that I'll catch the grasshopper
and the giraffe as a set today.

1178
01:02:21,341 --> 01:02:23,541
What in the world are you
talking about?

1179
01:02:24,404 --> 01:02:27,818
- How could you say such a thing?
- The words just stumbled out.

1180
01:02:27,819 --> 01:02:30,731
I guess this is the way I've always
talked since the day I was born.

1181
01:02:30,732 --> 01:02:32,946
Why were you all born so strangely?

1182
01:02:33,623 --> 01:02:36,438
Hey... is it us two against the rest?

1183
01:02:36,750 --> 01:02:39,999
First... I will tell you one bit of
important news to all of you.

1184
01:02:40,432 --> 01:02:46,939
Two of our opponent's bags are
now in our possession.

1185
01:02:46,940 --> 01:02:48,809
- Really?
- You found them?

1186
01:02:50,568 --> 01:02:52,785
- Isn't that a good thing?
- Yes, it is.

1187
01:02:52,786 --> 01:02:54,791
- Isn't it a good thing?
- Yes, it's great.

1188
01:02:54,792 --> 01:02:56,980
- But your expression says...
- You don't think it's great?

1189
01:02:56,981 --> 01:02:59,353
- You're not looking so happy.
- How am I supposed to react?

1190
01:02:59,354 --> 01:03:01,262
- Oh, yes! Yes!
- That's right.

1191
01:03:01,263 --> 01:03:04,280
[Is he supposed to act that excited?]

1192
01:03:04,281 --> 01:03:06,909
- Why do you keep suspecting Kwang Soo?
- He's known for his betraying.

1193
01:03:07,349 --> 01:03:11,826
- How did you find those two bags?
- There's no need for you to know that.

1194
01:03:11,827 --> 01:03:15,577
[Totally eliminated out of the loop.]

1195
01:03:15,578 --> 01:03:18,408
- What's there to like about this?
- You don't like it?

1196
01:03:18,409 --> 01:03:21,037
- What is there to like? I'm kept in the dark.
- Are you a spy?

1197
01:03:23,585 --> 01:03:27,540
Okay... let's just go and
find our last bag.

1198
01:03:27,541 --> 01:03:30,200
Isn't it just better for you to do it alone
instead of us getting involved then?

1199
01:03:30,790 --> 01:03:33,086
In hopes that we find the bag,
Mr. Kwang Soo, fighting.

1200
01:03:33,087 --> 01:03:34,873
- Jae Suk, fighting.
- He called you Mr. Kwang Soo.

1201
01:03:34,873 --> 01:03:38,989
[Even attaching 'Mr.'
in front of his name now...]

1202
01:03:39,377 --> 01:03:41,470
- Are you separating me now?
- Why are you suddenly distancing yourself?

1203
01:03:41,817 --> 01:03:44,653
- What... what are we then?
- Why are you treating us like this?

1204
01:03:44,654 --> 01:03:46,867
- We're just misters to you now?
- No, you're not.

1205
01:03:47,194 --> 01:03:48,264
Let's go.

1206
01:03:48,265 --> 01:03:49,897
Off we go!

1207
01:03:49,898 --> 01:03:51,299
Why don't you two come with us?

1208
01:03:51,777 --> 01:03:54,503
- Yes, we'll go.
- Let's all go together for now.

1209
01:03:55,076 --> 01:03:57,859
- What just happened?
- What are we going to do?

1210
01:03:57,860 --> 01:04:03,349
[Two innocents being suspected by Jung Min.
What will become of these two?]

1211
01:04:05,655 --> 01:04:07,788
[A moment later...]

1212
01:04:09,564 --> 01:04:12,412
- Jong Kook, where are you?
- I'm in Room 116 in the basement.

1213
01:04:12,413 --> 01:04:17,891
[Spy Ji Hyo and Jong Kook
arranging a meeting.]

1214
01:04:17,892 --> 01:04:19,136
Really? Where are you right now?

1215
01:04:26,726 --> 01:04:27,869
Kim Jong Kook!

1216
01:04:27,870 --> 01:04:29,566
Kim Jong Kook, hurry!

1217
01:04:34,922 --> 01:04:36,696
Where did they hide the bags?

1218
01:04:38,688 --> 01:04:43,811
You know the two bags that you hid?
The two bags that you hid away?

1219
01:04:43,812 --> 01:04:46,706
- Jung Min found them.
- Who told him where they were at?

1220
01:04:47,536 --> 01:04:50,234
I don't know that either.
I don't know who told him.

1221
01:04:51,492 --> 01:04:55,424
Send me a text with the location of
your bags or something.

1222
01:04:55,425 --> 01:04:59,732
The two bags that we found are
in the main building right now.

1223
01:04:59,905 --> 01:05:02,790
We're going to find the two bags that are here
and put them all together in one place.

1224
01:05:02,791 --> 01:05:04,429
- Really?
- You get what I'm saying?

1225
01:05:04,430 --> 01:05:06,924
- Tell me where that location is.
- I don't know the location right now.

1226
01:05:06,925 --> 01:05:11,850
But until I find out and tell you where...
don't oust Kwang Soo and Jae Suk.

1227
01:05:13,144 --> 01:05:18,492
[Planning on using Jae Suk and Kwang Soo
as her scapegoat to keep up her watch.]

1228
01:05:25,424 --> 01:05:27,914
[A moment later in the main building.]

1229
01:05:29,110 --> 01:05:33,959
[Moving the two bags they previously
hid away in the 747 to this location.]

1230
01:05:35,486 --> 01:05:36,653
We got it.

1231
01:05:36,654 --> 01:05:39,608
[Concealing it inside tag number 221.]

1232
01:05:42,679 --> 01:05:44,529
<i>Ji Hyo, where are you?</i>

1233
01:05:44,530 --> 01:05:47,202
- Tell him we're in the main building.
- We're in the main building, Jae Suk.

1234
01:05:47,203 --> 01:05:48,676
[Keeping it a secret from
Jae Suk and Kwang Soo.]

1235
01:05:50,013 --> 01:05:53,416
[Current number of bags that the
Actor Team has is four.]

1236
01:05:54,949 --> 01:05:58,474
[I will go to steal
all four of those bags!]

1237
01:06:00,214 --> 01:06:04,008
[And the two scapegoats...]

1238
01:06:04,326 --> 01:06:05,868
Let's try this again.

1239
01:06:05,869 --> 01:06:11,279
[Since we don't even know where our bags
are at, let's start searching all over.]

1240
01:06:13,021 --> 01:06:17,594
[A room that they've never
been in before...]

1241
01:06:20,790 --> 01:06:25,754
[Searching everywhere in hopes
of finding something.]

1242
01:06:32,879 --> 01:06:34,813
- Jae Suk...
- Yeah?

1243
01:06:34,814 --> 01:06:36,840
- Did you know that this opens?
- What opens?

1244
01:06:36,841 --> 01:06:38,380
This thing opens up.

1245
01:06:38,381 --> 01:06:40,334
- What?
- This wall opens up.

1246
01:06:40,914 --> 01:06:42,268
I knew that.

1247
01:06:44,390 --> 01:06:48,071
[But you still can't open it?]

1248
01:06:48,994 --> 01:06:50,555
You're supposed to slide it?

1249
01:06:51,003 --> 01:06:54,099
[That's!]

1250
01:06:54,100 --> 01:06:59,764
[The last seventh bag that they weren't
even given a hint about is discovered!]

1251
01:07:01,974 --> 01:07:05,961
I'm the one who guided you over here,
but you end up finding the bag...

1252
01:07:07,543 --> 01:07:12,235
[The bag no one was able to find
comes into their hands!]

1253
01:07:13,934 --> 01:07:15,488
We're good.

1254
01:07:18,684 --> 01:07:22,789
[Carefully concealing back into
where they found the bag.]

1255
01:07:23,314 --> 01:07:24,479
It's good.

1256
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:30,130
[Is this the end of their sorrow of being
suspected by their own team leader?]

1257
01:07:30,131 --> 01:07:33,354
All seven of the bags have to be
gathered together to win anyways, right?

1258
01:07:33,616 --> 01:07:35,908
We have a weapon too now.

1259
01:07:36,809 --> 01:07:43,983
[This is when the victory started leaning
towards the ending we never predicted...]

1260
01:07:44,792 --> 01:07:46,320
[Actor Team - four bags,
Singer Team - two bags.]

1261
01:07:46,320 --> 01:07:49,971
[Jae Suk and Kwang Soo
in possession of one bag.]

1262
01:07:49,972 --> 01:07:55,086
[All seven bags have now been discovered.
Now time to start the elimination...]

1263
01:07:55,087 --> 01:07:57,387
All five of them are going around together.

1264
01:07:59,055 --> 01:08:03,278
[Are they starting to make their
moves to eliminate each other?]

1265
01:08:03,279 --> 01:08:07,150
- We have to eliminate them, so get him!
- Jae Suk is behind you. Watch your back.

1266
01:08:07,151 --> 01:08:09,583
- Wait, Jae Suk...
- Hang on...

1267
01:08:10,682 --> 01:08:13,990
[Just then!]

1268
01:08:13,990 --> 01:08:16,667
[Jong Kook vs. Sung Woong!]

1269
01:08:16,668 --> 01:08:19,522
[So quickly!
Who will come out the victor?]

1270
01:08:19,523 --> 01:08:22,542
[Jong Kook eliminates him first!]

1271
01:08:22,543 --> 01:08:26,317
[Jong Kook eliminates
Sung Woong's name tag.]

1272
01:08:26,317 --> 01:08:29,893
[Park Sung Woong, out!]

1273
01:08:30,624 --> 01:08:35,221
[After talking about eliminating Jong Kook
all day, so easily...]

1274
01:08:36,712 --> 01:08:39,999
- Why didn't you help him out?
- I didn't even get a chance to.

1275
01:08:42,299 --> 01:08:43,714
Let's think about this carefully.

1276
01:08:43,715 --> 01:08:46,739
Since you eliminated one person
from our team...

1277
01:08:47,054 --> 01:08:48,780
So why don't you eliminate
one from your team too?

1278
01:08:51,893 --> 01:08:54,528
- No... no!
- Don't put your hand on me.

1279
01:08:55,316 --> 01:08:58,332
[Gets upset just by a mere touch
of his hand on his shoulders.]

1280
01:09:00,081 --> 01:09:01,680
I have...

1281
01:09:01,940 --> 01:09:05,955
a total of six bags.

1282
01:09:05,956 --> 01:09:06,963
What?

1283
01:09:06,963 --> 01:09:10,267
[What? You have six?]

1284
01:09:10,268 --> 01:09:12,769
- Why didn't you tell us that?
- Why are you keeping that a secret from us?

1285
01:09:12,770 --> 01:09:14,454
How can you have six when we have two?

1286
01:09:14,455 --> 01:09:17,111
[When the Singer Team has two bags,
how could he have six?]

1287
01:09:17,703 --> 01:09:21,032
Let's go check to make sure
that we still have those bags.

1288
01:09:21,033 --> 01:09:24,842
- Please go ahead and check.
- Then we'll go check and come back.

1289
01:09:24,843 --> 01:09:28,009
[Agreeing to meet back again after verifying
that they still have their two bags.]

1290
01:09:28,010 --> 01:09:29,820
- We'll go check that first...
- And you're coming back?

1291
01:09:29,821 --> 01:09:36,457
[My plan... you figured it out,
right Gary?]

1292
01:09:36,457 --> 01:09:41,009
[Go check on the bags and let me know
where the bags are kept hidden.]

1293
01:09:43,984 --> 01:09:46,182
Isn't it better for me to go
and check on them?

1294
01:09:46,183 --> 01:09:48,766
Why don't I go and check to see
if they're still there?

1295
01:09:48,767 --> 01:09:52,139
- I can just go check.
- No, Dong Hoon and I'll go.

1296
01:09:52,140 --> 01:09:54,993
No, no... not you.
We moved the location.

1297
01:09:54,994 --> 01:09:57,691
Why are we being like this?
Wait... wait.

1298
01:10:00,118 --> 01:10:02,451
<i>It's just that we're a little suspicious.</i>

1299
01:10:07,418 --> 01:10:10,890
I'm positive that their two bags
are in the basement somewhere.

1300
01:10:11,509 --> 01:10:13,922
It's hidden somewhere in the basement.

1301
01:10:13,923 --> 01:10:17,098
[Jung Min having guessed where the bags are
kept by the other team's movements.]

1302
01:10:17,946 --> 01:10:22,852
[If I can get the two bags from them,
the victory will soon be mine!]

1303
01:10:25,139 --> 01:10:26,968
After thinking about it...

1304
01:10:27,969 --> 01:10:30,032
I'm getting really suspicious of Hyuna.

1305
01:10:31,072 --> 01:10:33,264
- So I moved the bags elsewhere.
- You did?

1306
01:10:33,265 --> 01:10:34,654
- I moved them to a new hiding spot.
- Okay, you did good.

1307
01:10:34,655 --> 01:10:36,342
I moved it to a new spot,
but I told Dong Hoon about it.

1308
01:10:36,740 --> 01:10:38,375
The reason being...

1309
01:10:39,125 --> 01:10:41,221
I thought that he would be
the safest.

1310
01:10:41,814 --> 01:10:43,075
But if that's gone,
then Dong Hoon is the spy.

1311
01:10:43,076 --> 01:10:45,130
- You're right!
- If that's gone, then it's Dong Hoon.

1312
01:10:46,944 --> 01:10:50,568
The spy on the other team...
I planted Ji Hyo as the spy.

1313
01:10:54,675 --> 01:10:57,766
- Okay... I get it now.
- You get the idea?

1314
01:10:57,767 --> 01:11:05,464
[The place where Big-nosed Brother hid away
the bags are... in the basement dining room.]

1315
01:11:12,933 --> 01:11:15,065
[Verifying the two bags.]

1316
01:11:19,814 --> 01:11:23,181
[So that's where they're at...]

1317
01:11:27,383 --> 01:11:30,658
<i>[Basement dining room]</i>

1318
01:11:31,784 --> 01:11:35,253
[Jung Min... hurry up and steal them!]

1319
01:11:36,783 --> 01:11:40,164
[Both spies working earnestly
in their roles.]

1320
01:11:43,720 --> 01:11:47,307
Basement... the document library.

1321
01:11:47,308 --> 01:11:50,232
Basement... the document library,
inside the shopping bag.

1322
01:11:50,978 --> 01:11:52,032
She found out the location.

1323
01:11:52,124 --> 01:11:58,884
[Both teams on the move at the same time
from the reports made by their spies.]

1324
01:12:00,093 --> 01:12:01,338
Shopping bag.

1325
01:12:07,126 --> 01:12:09,167
Here it is. It was so light
that I almost didn't know.

1326
01:12:09,168 --> 01:12:11,444
[Discovers the bag thanks to the information
given to them by their spy, Ji Hyo.]

1327
01:12:12,632 --> 01:12:16,036
[Re-hiding it in the same area
without moving it too far away.]

1328
01:12:18,667 --> 01:12:20,271
- Suk Jin, I think there's another one here.
- You found something?

1329
01:12:20,272 --> 01:12:22,711
[Discovers another hidden bag!]

1330
01:12:24,394 --> 01:12:27,226
Where should we hide these now
so that they can't find them?

1331
01:12:27,227 --> 01:12:30,666
Look in the boxes over there.
Are there any empty boxes?

1332
01:12:32,100 --> 01:12:35,643
[Concealing it in the empty box
through the help of an employee.]

1333
01:12:38,287 --> 01:12:39,908
Can you tape it too?

1334
01:12:39,909 --> 01:12:42,781
Okay, and let just put it up there.

1335
01:12:44,452 --> 01:12:47,106
[Marking the box so that it doesn't
get mixed up with other boxes.]

1336
01:12:49,239 --> 01:12:50,883
Okay, let's go.

1337
01:12:53,772 --> 01:12:58,670
[Changing the ownership of the bags
to the Singer Team!]

1338
01:13:00,248 --> 01:13:04,015
You know the last two bags?

1339
01:13:04,309 --> 01:13:06,769
- They're down in the basement dining room.
- Really?

1340
01:13:08,194 --> 01:13:13,986
[My goodness... Jung Min still has
utmost trust in Ji Hyo.]

1341
01:13:19,661 --> 01:13:25,939
[Jung Min is heading off to check on the
two bags in the document library.]

1342
01:13:25,940 --> 01:13:27,467
I have a feeling they haven't found it.

1343
01:13:30,749 --> 01:13:32,207
Please excuse me.

1344
01:13:39,106 --> 01:13:40,294
They found it.

1345
01:13:42,041 --> 01:13:45,669
[Verifies that his two bags
have been found.]

1346
01:13:47,497 --> 01:13:52,196
[Just how did this happen?
What is going on?]

1347
01:13:55,018 --> 01:13:56,697
- Ji Hyo, what have you heard?
- Oh my goodness!

1348
01:13:56,698 --> 01:13:59,632
- I'm looking for the bags right now.
- We've been robbed.

1349
01:14:01,061 --> 01:14:02,383
- We've been robbed?
- Yeah.

1350
01:14:03,136 --> 01:14:05,386
There's no way they could've
known about that.

1351
01:14:05,387 --> 01:14:07,896
[Acting as though she's shocked.]

1352
01:14:07,897 --> 01:14:12,004
- There were only two in there, right?
- Yeah, only two.

1353
01:14:12,005 --> 01:14:15,017
You and I are the only two
who knew about that hiding spot.

1354
01:14:15,018 --> 01:14:19,502
[Jung Min is still not suspecting Ji Hyo.]

1355
01:14:19,502 --> 01:14:21,203
Jung Min, I'm sorry...

1356
01:14:23,691 --> 01:14:26,440
[Spy Gary told me they were
here somewhere...]

1357
01:14:26,441 --> 01:14:28,459
[Nice! Found them...]

1358
01:14:30,556 --> 01:14:33,874
[In this case, the Actor Team's
bag count goes back up to four!]

1359
01:14:33,875 --> 01:14:37,186
- Let's take the whole basket.
- Let's just get them out of here first.

1360
01:14:37,187 --> 01:14:39,117
Let's take these and get back
up to the first floor.

1361
01:14:40,342 --> 01:14:45,153
[With the spies working internally,
the ownership of the bags keeps changing.]

1362
01:14:46,498 --> 01:14:49,583
[At the same time...]

1363
01:14:49,584 --> 01:14:51,760
If our name tag is ripped off,
is it all over then?

1364
01:14:52,163 --> 01:14:57,629
[Gary calling Hyuna out alone
to take her somewhere...]

1365
01:15:06,613 --> 01:15:09,053
[Spy Gary eliminates his own teammate,
Hyuna's name tag!]

1366
01:15:11,112 --> 01:15:13,097
Hyuna... wait.

1367
01:15:13,098 --> 01:15:15,135
[Hyuna, Out!]

1368
01:15:16,196 --> 01:15:17,635
Seriously...

1369
01:15:17,636 --> 01:15:20,163
[So you are the spy!]

1370
01:15:22,038 --> 01:15:27,063
[At the same time, Ha Ha gets
attacked by Jae Suk and Kwang Soo.]

1371
01:15:27,064 --> 01:15:28,159
What are you doing?

1372
01:15:31,592 --> 01:15:33,959
[Ha Ha, Out!]

1373
01:15:34,928 --> 01:15:38,167
[Spy Gary fleeing the scene
immediately.]

1374
01:15:38,168 --> 01:15:40,938
I told you that it wasn't me.
Why can't you believe me?

1375
01:15:40,939 --> 01:15:44,486
- You were both grabbing onto me.
- Why didn't you tell us?

1376
01:15:44,487 --> 01:15:46,364
You weren't listening to me,
you Dumb and Dumber!

1377
01:15:46,692 --> 01:15:49,350
[Dumb and Dumber...]

1378
01:15:49,351 --> 01:15:51,497
- What did we do that was so wrong?
- You idiots!

1379
01:15:56,526 --> 01:16:00,540
But... I thought we would get lucky
and catch the spy.

1380
01:16:01,988 --> 01:16:07,330
[Dumb and Dumber not getting
what's going on today whatsoever...]

1381
01:16:08,538 --> 01:16:10,598
- Jong Kook...
- Let's oust the idiots.

1382
01:16:10,599 --> 01:16:12,925
[Proposing to oust Dumb and Dumber,
who has no idea what's going on.]

1383
01:16:13,667 --> 01:16:18,407
[At the rate it's going, Gary may
get ousted by his own Actor Team.]

1384
01:16:18,408 --> 01:16:19,533
- I lost Kwang Soo at the last minute.
- Really?

1385
01:16:25,494 --> 01:16:29,370
[Jong Kook eliminates Gary's name tag!]

1386
01:16:29,371 --> 01:16:31,739
[Spy]

1387
01:16:32,930 --> 01:16:34,691
[Verifying that Gary is the spy
for the Actor Team.]

1388
01:16:36,313 --> 01:16:37,694
Gary, I'm sorry.

1389
01:16:37,695 --> 01:16:40,570
[Confirms that Gary was the spy.]

1390
01:16:41,162 --> 01:16:46,845
[This is a big problem...
Jung Min, what do we do?]

1391
01:16:52,085 --> 01:16:56,079
<i>[Gary, out!
Gary, out!]</i>

1392
01:17:11,319 --> 01:17:12,342
<i>Let me explain this again.</i>

1393
01:17:12,342 --> 01:17:15,785
First...
there were two in the document library.

1394
01:17:16,268 --> 01:17:21,328
[The two bags that were kept hidden
in the documents library have disappeared.]

1395
01:17:21,329 --> 01:17:22,504
I went and checked for myself.

1396
01:17:22,505 --> 01:17:25,569
- Then why did you keep lying to us about it?
- That's what I'm trying to explain.

1397
01:17:25,570 --> 01:17:27,631
It's because I couldn't trust any of you.

1398
01:17:27,632 --> 01:17:30,322
Gary was a spy for our team.

1399
01:17:30,939 --> 01:17:34,190
Gary was a spy for our team.
[So it was Gary.]

1400
01:17:34,595 --> 01:17:37,351
- Then Gary was getting information for you?
- Yes, he got me information I needed.

1401
01:17:37,352 --> 01:17:42,540
And that phone call earlier was to Gary and
everything was a plan Gary and I made.

1402
01:17:42,541 --> 01:17:43,960
Then doesn't that make you a spy?
[Dumb]

1403
01:17:43,961 --> 01:17:45,243
- What?
- Then aren't you a spy?

1404
01:17:45,243 --> 01:17:46,827
Then why am I not a spy?
[Dumber]

1405
01:17:47,390 --> 01:17:50,424
- What are you talking about now?
- You're not a spy?

1406
01:17:50,690 --> 01:17:54,471
I planted a spy over there so that
our team could win.

1407
01:17:55,466 --> 01:17:59,667
- Then the other team planted one on our side?
- Then there's a spy here too?

1408
01:17:59,668 --> 01:18:02,593
- That's right.
- Then Jong Kook planted one here?

1409
01:18:02,594 --> 01:18:04,449
- That's right.
- But why isn't that person doing anything?

1410
01:18:04,915 --> 01:18:08,744
It's because the spy did something that the
two in the documents library are gone.

1411
01:18:10,785 --> 01:18:13,756
[Dumb and Dumber finally starting to
figure out what's going on.]

1412
01:18:21,369 --> 01:18:23,871
- What were you guys doing?
- Seeing what's going on here...

1413
01:18:24,197 --> 01:18:27,566
There's a spy on both of the teams.

1414
01:18:27,567 --> 01:18:31,115
- This is really fun today.
- But the spy from your team was Gary.

1415
01:18:31,116 --> 01:18:32,982
Now that I think about it,
this is really fun today.

1416
01:18:32,983 --> 01:18:35,571
[Dumb and Dumber getting excited
after finally having figured things out.]

1417
01:18:35,572 --> 01:18:37,312
This is really awesome.

1418
01:18:38,335 --> 01:18:41,271
- This is really exciting.
- I hope the viewers are enjoying it.

1419
01:18:41,614 --> 01:18:42,992
This is really fun.

1420
01:18:42,993 --> 01:18:44,662
Are you sure that there's a spy
from both teams?

1421
01:18:44,663 --> 01:18:47,755
Jung Min's spy was Gary.

1422
01:18:47,756 --> 01:18:51,110
And a spy from your team is here somewhere.

1423
01:18:51,111 --> 01:18:52,649
- Where?
- It's one of us three.

1424
01:18:52,650 --> 01:18:54,715
Do you trust each other then?

1425
01:18:55,142 --> 01:18:58,348
We've come too far now
not to trust each other.

1426
01:19:00,023 --> 01:19:04,413
I thought you guys were stuck together
because you've been together all day.

1427
01:19:04,414 --> 01:19:07,412
I even know how many times
Jae Suk's gone to the bathroom today.

1428
01:19:09,774 --> 01:19:14,222
[In the meantime, Jung Min brings the bags he
found in the dining room to the coat room.]

1429
01:19:23,414 --> 01:19:26,396
[On the other hand]

1430
01:19:26,397 --> 01:19:28,044
<i>Why don't you go up that way?
And we'll go up this way.</i>

1431
01:19:28,045 --> 01:19:30,393
Lee Kwang Soo...
why don't you come this way?

1432
01:19:30,394 --> 01:19:33,662
You keep getting suspected because
you two have been together all day.

1433
01:19:33,663 --> 01:19:36,512
Just go for now since
even Ji Hyo is starting to get suspicious.

1434
01:19:37,671 --> 01:19:41,555
[Dumb and Dumber finally separating
just as Ji Hyo had planned.]

1435
01:19:43,394 --> 01:19:45,681
[And this is how the Actor Team
ended up going their separate ways.]

1436
01:19:48,966 --> 01:19:52,554
[Closing on the grasshopper who's been
separated from the rest of his herd.]

1437
01:19:52,555 --> 01:19:53,800
Where did Kwang Soo go?

1438
01:19:55,021 --> 01:19:56,899
- Kwang Soo's downstairs.
- I'll go this way.

1439
01:19:56,900 --> 01:20:00,896
[Separated Dumb and Dumber are
now an even easier prey.]

1440
01:20:00,896 --> 01:20:04,006
[Attacking Jae Suk who's finally
starting to figure things out.]

1441
01:20:04,967 --> 01:20:06,269
Kwang Soo!

1442
01:20:06,524 --> 01:20:08,528
Kwang Soo... Kwang Soo!

1443
01:20:08,529 --> 01:20:10,473
[Eliminates Jae Suk's name tag
from the Actor Team.]

1444
01:20:10,474 --> 01:20:12,193
[Jae Suk, Out!]

1445
01:20:15,500 --> 01:20:18,282
[Team Leader Jung Min getting flustered at
the announcement of Jae Suk's elimination.]

1446
01:20:20,521 --> 01:20:25,221
[Now only two team members left...
who's the spy?]

1447
01:20:27,671 --> 01:20:28,987
Jae Suk!

1448
01:20:31,962 --> 01:20:33,917
[Wait...]

1449
01:20:33,917 --> 01:20:38,643
[If Jae Suk's been ousted,
and he's not the spy...]

1450
01:20:38,965 --> 01:20:40,379
[That means...]

1451
01:20:40,379 --> 01:20:46,244
[Ji Hyo is the spy?]

1452
01:20:46,807 --> 01:20:48,093
It's not down in the dining room?

1453
01:20:48,094 --> 01:20:49,762
Jae Suk...

1454
01:20:54,159 --> 01:20:55,347
Stop!

1455
01:20:55,348 --> 01:20:56,744
[Kwang Soo eliminates Ji Hyo's name tag.]

1456
01:20:56,745 --> 01:20:58,157
Trust me.

1457
01:20:58,158 --> 01:21:00,071
Hang on... look at her back.

1458
01:21:00,474 --> 01:21:01,685
Look at her back.

1459
01:21:02,918 --> 01:21:05,644
She's a spy... she's the spy.

1460
01:21:05,645 --> 01:21:08,960
[Ji Hyo that he trusted so much...]

1461
01:21:11,050 --> 01:21:17,131
[After giving Jung Min a mental meltdown,
Ji Hyo is ousted!]

1462
01:21:18,879 --> 01:21:21,816
[Panic]

1463
01:21:21,817 --> 01:21:25,204
[Wait! This isn't the time for this!]

1464
01:21:25,205 --> 01:21:26,747
Wait here... wait here.

1465
01:21:27,296 --> 01:21:33,753
[It's possible Ji Hyo could've told them about
the bags in coat rack 221...]

1466
01:21:36,639 --> 01:21:40,672
[Rushing to move them to
another number.]

1467
01:21:51,420 --> 01:21:53,590
384... 384.

1468
01:21:56,158 --> 01:22:01,017
[Who knew Jung Min would be left with
Kwang Soo who he's mistrusted all day...]

1469
01:22:01,018 --> 01:22:02,289
How did you find out?

1470
01:22:02,289 --> 01:22:05,207
Because I knew that it wasn't
either Jae Suk or myself.

1471
01:22:06,473 --> 01:22:09,842
Are you aware that I'm the only one who knows
where the last remaining bag is hidden?

1472
01:22:09,843 --> 01:22:11,238
Really? Where is it?

1473
01:22:11,239 --> 01:22:13,802
- Only Jae Suk and I knew...
- So where is it?

1474
01:22:13,803 --> 01:22:16,002
[The location of the seventh bag that only
Dumb and Dumber were aware of.]

1475
01:22:16,123 --> 01:22:18,669
[More urgent than that...]

1476
01:22:18,670 --> 01:22:23,817
[Is to find out where their two bags from
the documents library were taken to!]

1477
01:22:23,818 --> 01:22:26,020
No, let's just leave those there for now.

1478
01:22:26,021 --> 01:22:27,607
I'm positive those two
are around here somewhere.

1479
01:22:28,451 --> 01:22:30,153
I think this man knows where it is.

1480
01:22:30,154 --> 01:22:31,655
Where is it?

1481
01:22:31,656 --> 01:22:32,937
[The employee who's witnessed
everything.]

1482
01:22:32,938 --> 01:22:35,593
- I don't think I'm supposed to tell you.
- No, it's okay.

1483
01:22:36,665 --> 01:22:40,369
He can't tell us? But I know it's here.
I'm positive it's in here somewhere.

1484
01:22:41,872 --> 01:22:47,886
[Positive they're hidden in this room somewhere
since it's hard to move the bags around.]

1485
01:22:47,886 --> 01:22:49,622
I'm positive it's in here somewhere.

1486
01:22:55,005 --> 01:22:56,199
It's not here.

1487
01:23:05,403 --> 01:23:07,433
[Jong Kook eliminates Jung Min's name tag!]

1488
01:23:11,814 --> 01:23:15,479
I'm the only one who knows where
all the other bags are being kept.

1489
01:23:15,480 --> 01:23:17,353
- We can find it.
- No, I don't think you can.

1490
01:23:17,825 --> 01:23:19,713
- Kwang Soo doesn't know?
- What?

1491
01:23:19,714 --> 01:23:23,301
- Kwang Soo doesn't know where?
- No, Kwang Soo doesn't know.

1492
01:23:24,982 --> 01:23:27,012
<i>- The way I see it, he knows everything.
- You know, don't you?</i>

1493
01:23:27,013 --> 01:23:30,137
He already knows.
The reason being, there's no other way.

1494
01:23:30,138 --> 01:23:32,606
[Singer Team slowly closing in
on Kwang Soo.]

1495
01:23:32,607 --> 01:23:33,752
I'm sure that he's been told everything.

1496
01:23:33,753 --> 01:23:35,849
In case something happens,
I'm sure he's been told everything.

1497
01:23:35,850 --> 01:23:38,820
[Jung Min... what do I do...]

1498
01:23:38,821 --> 01:23:43,389
[You have to do something!
Think carefully...]

1499
01:23:43,897 --> 01:23:45,961
I'm sure that he's been told.
Let's get out of here for now.

1500
01:23:45,962 --> 01:23:47,319
- Come out here.
- Jong Kook...

1501
01:23:48,164 --> 01:23:49,590
Don't get any closer.

1502
01:23:50,267 --> 01:23:52,869
[Giraffe threatening to off himself?]

1503
01:23:54,457 --> 01:23:59,647
[Threatening them with his knowledge
of where the bags are located.]

1504
01:23:59,648 --> 01:24:02,245
But if he eliminates himself, we'll
be searching for the next five hours.

1505
01:24:02,246 --> 01:24:06,586
[If Kwang Soo sacrifices himself,
it'll be few more hours of searching.]

1506
01:24:06,587 --> 01:24:08,355
- Go...
- Then let's do this.

1507
01:24:08,611 --> 01:24:11,511
Why don't we bring all the bags
and put them together?

1508
01:24:11,512 --> 01:24:13,780
Then the two bags
that are in there right now...

1509
01:24:13,781 --> 01:24:15,725
Bring those bags out first.

1510
01:24:15,726 --> 01:24:17,255
You have to bring yours too then.

1511
01:24:17,256 --> 01:24:19,419
Then do whatever you want.
I don't care.

1512
01:24:20,563 --> 01:24:23,536
[Wow... the Giraffe is coming out strong!]

1513
01:24:23,537 --> 01:24:25,049
Are your ears deaf?

1514
01:24:25,381 --> 01:24:28,663
What do you mean, deaf?
I'm saying, let's put all the bags together.

1515
01:24:28,664 --> 01:24:29,668
Where are you going?

1516
01:24:29,669 --> 01:24:31,936
Forget it. I don't want you
two to talk to me anymore.

1517
01:24:31,937 --> 01:24:34,210
Kwang Soo, don't be like that.
Kwang Soo... Kwang Soo!

1518
01:24:34,211 --> 01:24:37,186
- Kwang Soo...
- Where is he going?

1519
01:24:37,187 --> 01:24:39,634
- Come back here, come on.
- Why are we groveling to him?

1520
01:24:39,635 --> 01:24:41,250
He's not turning around.

1521
01:24:41,251 --> 01:24:43,943
Kwang Soo, come back here.
He really isn't turning around.

1522
01:24:43,944 --> 01:24:46,858
I'm going back in there to look for the bags,
so you two do whatever you want.

1523
01:24:46,859 --> 01:24:49,009
- Kwang Soo...
- What are you going to do with them?

1524
01:24:51,044 --> 01:24:54,956
[Since he's made the threat...
he needs to find the bags.]

1525
01:24:57,014 --> 01:24:59,845
- That Kwang Soo, seriously...
- Why are we groveling right now?

1526
01:24:59,846 --> 01:25:02,431
- There are two of us.
- But he knows where they're all at.

1527
01:25:02,432 --> 01:25:04,967
If we oust him,
we have no other answers.

1528
01:25:04,968 --> 01:25:07,032
- We're going to be searching for two days.
- I know.

1529
01:25:08,221 --> 01:25:10,135
I've looked everywhere...

1530
01:25:12,127 --> 01:25:13,882
Unreal, isn't it?

1531
01:25:13,917 --> 01:25:15,608
- It's not here.
- I'm telling you, it's not in there.

1532
01:25:15,609 --> 01:25:17,813
Even with my hand on it, I can't rip it off.

1533
01:25:17,814 --> 01:25:20,286
- I can't even rip it off.
- Get your hand off of me.

1534
01:25:20,287 --> 01:25:22,420
- Even with my hand on it...
- You can't rip it off.

1535
01:25:23,369 --> 01:25:26,210
- Should we just...
- This is a big problem.

1536
01:25:28,460 --> 01:25:32,501
[Huh? Where is he going off to now?]

1537
01:25:33,806 --> 01:25:36,545
[Wait, that's...]

1538
01:25:38,026 --> 01:25:39,509
Even if I carry it around....

1539
01:25:41,228 --> 01:25:43,272
it doesn't matter since they
don't know where the others are.

1540
01:25:44,207 --> 01:25:50,650
[Carrying the bag out confidently,
but what is it that he's planning?]

1541
01:25:50,651 --> 01:25:52,231
- What are you doing with that?
- What good is one going to do?

1542
01:25:52,232 --> 01:25:53,352
Here, hang onto this.

1543
01:25:53,353 --> 01:25:55,519
[Confidently carrying it out to Jong Kook?]

1544
01:25:55,520 --> 01:25:58,357
- Is this 'R' real?
- Yeah, it's the real bag.

1545
01:25:58,358 --> 01:26:01,159
Are you sure that it's real?
The 'R' is a different color.

1546
01:26:01,160 --> 01:26:03,425
I'll let you each pick it up once.

1547
01:26:04,622 --> 01:26:06,526
- Okay, I get it.
- Put out your hand.

1548
01:26:07,316 --> 01:26:08,528
Two hands.

1549
01:26:11,507 --> 01:26:13,824
[Kwang Soo attacks Mr. Capable!]

1550
01:26:17,336 --> 01:26:20,340
[Wow! Giraffe uses his resources
to eliminate the Tiger!]

1551
01:26:20,341 --> 01:26:24,644
<i>[Kim Jong Kook, Out!

1552
01:26:25,734 --> 01:26:27,654
[You just wait and see...]

1553
01:26:29,468 --> 01:26:33,129
[Now the only fight left is between
the fateful Easy Brothers...]

1554
01:26:33,130 --> 01:26:34,543
- Just rip mine off.
- Suk Jin...

1555
01:26:34,544 --> 01:26:37,766
Just go look for it yourself.
Look for it all day. Rip it off.

1556
01:26:37,767 --> 01:26:39,127
[Oh... Big-nosed Brother
is coming out strong too?]

1557
01:26:41,278 --> 01:26:42,779
Rip it off.
I'm tired too now.

1558
01:26:48,116 --> 01:26:49,450
Hang on a second...

1559
01:26:49,451 --> 01:26:50,793
You're really going to rip it off?

1560
01:26:50,794 --> 01:26:53,475
- I'll rip it off.
- You'll be searching all day.

1561
01:26:54,281 --> 01:26:58,771
[Giraffe not paying any attention
to anything Big-nosed Brother is saying.]

1562
01:27:01,018 --> 01:27:03,695
Kwang Soo, no matter...
the day is here for the Easy Brothers.

1563
01:27:04,831 --> 01:27:08,005
This really is...
Pil-Chok-Cross.

1564
01:27:11,050 --> 01:27:12,984
Pil-Chok-Cross.

1565

them in there...]

[Huh? Those bags are...]

01:27:36,425 --> 01:27:37,569
Hey!

1568
01:27:38,242 --> 01:27:39,920
How did you find those?

[Kwang Soo, how did he find the two
bags that were hidden away?]

1570

[A little while ago while Jong Kook
and Suk Jin were headed his way...]

[Why does this box only look as though
it's been opened recently?]

1572
01:28:05,212 --> 01:28:10,357
[Giraffe already discovered it
before it all happened!]

1573
01:28:12,375 --> 01:28:17,857
[Leisurely walking over to where the remaining
four are with three already in hand.]

[The four bags he hid away with
Jung Min in coat rack 384.]

1575
01:28:24,551 --> 01:28:26,991
- Thanks for your hard work.
- Did you get ousted?

1576
01:28:28,545 --> 01:28:31,115
What do you mean, ousted?
Look at all the bags I have.

1577
01:28:31,116 --> 01:28:32,464

bags to him is the winner!]

01:29:26,529 --> 01:29:28,217
What is this?

1596
01:29:28,218 --> 01:29:29,537
Kwang Soo...

1597
01:29:29,985 --> 01:29:31,303
What happened?

1598
01:29:31,304 --> 01:29:34,769
- Did he win?
- I'm the winner today!

1599
01:29:37,293 --> 01:29:41,966
[For Kwang Soo, the Dumber to win...]

1600
01:29:45,701 --> 01:29:47,830
Since Gary was a part of our team,
he shares our prize?

1601
01:29:47,831 --> 01:29:49,508
- Of course!
- I see.

1602
01:29:49,509 --> 01:29:52,518
- He did great work for us.
- How are you on our team?

1603
01:29:52,519 --> 01:29:55,236
What are you talking about?
I got you all the information.

1604
01:29:55,237 --> 01:29:57,469
Gary gave us all the information,
so he's on our team.

1605
01:29:57,470 --> 01:29:59,359
[Even though he won, he still
hasn't got it all figured out...]

1606
01:29:59,360 --> 01:30:02,603
- Just watch the broadcast.
- Why else would Ji Hyo be over there?

1607
01:30:02,604 --> 01:30:04,068
Don't even explain it to him.

1608
01:30:04,069 --> 01:30:09,070
With this being a first visit from
Sung Woong and Jung Min...

1609
01:30:09,416 --> 01:30:13,816
the way I see it, they had no cause
not to suspect Kwang Soo this whole time.

1610
01:30:13,817 --> 01:30:15,320
You shouldn't have suspected me.

1611
01:30:15,321 --> 01:30:17,454
Then maybe you should've been better
at how you played the games.

1612
01:30:17,455 --> 01:30:20,882
I'm telling you this now,
but I'm just weird to begin with.
