<i>Myungdong, Namdaemun,
Dongdaemun...</i>

00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:34,900
It's so pretty.

Namsan... Namsan tower!

20
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,100
Seeing the Namsan tower is reminding me
of the Macau tower.

21
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:20,850
What is this all about
so early in the morning?

22
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,940

[At this rate,
solving the secret password will be...]

28
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:43,050
<i>[Treasure]</i>

29
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:44,620
That's what treasure means?

30
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:47,340
Treasure hunter...

31
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:49,470
Ah, that treasure?

32
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:54,000
[Asia's Prince isn't very
versed in foreign languages...]

33
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,690
If you put it like that,
it's not very easy to understand.

34
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:57,530
I know English very well.

35
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:03,120
[Huh? This is...]

36
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:07,530
[And a pencil holder?]

37
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:09,300
What is this?

38
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:16,360
[Is this the cipher?]

39
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:19,190
[What kind of a cipher is this supposed to be?]

40
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:25,410
<i>By gathering the strength of seven men,
to find the seven treasures...</i>

41
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:27,250
<i>find the treasure that's been
lost to time.</i>

42
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:32,250
Let me look at this closely.
I wonder if it's a coded message?

43
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:34,740
[Just how are they supposed to solve this?]

44
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:38,740
What is this?
Why are we being given school supplies?

45
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:41,460
Why is there a glue stick in here?

46
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:44,940
In Running Man...

47
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:47,890
there's always something.

48
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,900
This isn't what's needed.

49
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,680
This is it.

50
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,480
[Just the pencil holder?]

51
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,660
I bet there's something hidden in here.

52
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:03,390
[Ah... I guess we didn't think of that...]

53
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:12,120
[In front of 'D' theater]

54
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:19,040
[Oh... a Hallyu Idol star, Choi Si Won!]

55
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:28,230
[With exaggerated reactions...
and a peculiar speech pattern.]

56
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:32,420
[The man who's extreme reactions
serve as his trademark...]

57
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:34,600
[Why was he brought here?]

58
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:38,820
[Si Won also received a mission card.]

59
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:40,180
This is my third one.

60
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:43,120
<i>You guys are talented
treasure hunters.</i>

61
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,590
[Si Won is another treasure hunter!]

62
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:47,840
- The secret password is contained in this.
- In this?

63
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:50,890
[Si Won also receives the mysterious cipher.]

64
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:53,160
Solve this by the end of the day.

65
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:55,940
<i>Fascinating and royal...</i>

66
00:03:56,910 --> 00:04:00,230
<i>The treasure...</i>

67
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:01,510
What the heck?

68
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,010
What is this?

69
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:17,000
Royal... and fascinating...

70
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,050
[You're just supposed to read it...]

71
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:20,800
Numbers?
Do I need to replace them with numbers?

72
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:22,900
[Unable to comprehend]

73
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,900
I don't get it.

74
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,920
<i>[If you want to decipher the message,
go to these three places.]</i>

75
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:35,250
<i>[A hair salon, a kimbap restaurant,
and a children's amusement park?]</i>

76
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:40,270
I'm going to start by
going to the hair salon first.

77
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:42,280
I have no idea what this is.

78
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:45,490
[Heading off to the locations where
the clues are kept waiting for them.]

79
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:48,130
<i>I'm hungry,
so I'm going to the restaurant.</i>

80
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:54,810
[Nonstop muttering from the get-go.]

81
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,070
[What does this have to do
with the treasure?]

82
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,370
[Hair salon]

83
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:19,240
<i>Even this early in the morning...
people are in here getting their hair done?</i>

84
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:23,340
[This early in the morning...
people are here getting a perm?]

85
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:26,530
<i>You're not rolling the hair right.</i>

86
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:29,180
<i>I'll roll it up nice and neat for you.</i>

87
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:32,000
- A wide roller needs to be used for this.
- Really?

88
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:34,420
[Wait, their conversation is...]

89
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:36,060
[Kind of strange?]

90
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:39,200
Of course, I can roll it up.

91
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,360
Roll it outwards?

92
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:44,980
Roll it outwards?
Wide rollers, and rolled outwards...

93
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:47,370
[Having listened to the conversation,
it's about rolling... and rolling...]

94
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:48,960
[Kimbap restaurant]

95
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,810
<i>I'll take the vegetable kimbap.</i>

96
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:52,660
[Starved Mr. Capable
orders a vegetable kimbap.]

97
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:53,720
Yes.

98
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,770
Two rolls of vegetable kimbap, please.

99
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:57,570
- Two rolls, please.
- Okay.

100
00:05:57,570 --> 00:06:00,260
[Wait... they're saying 'Roll' here too?]

101
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:04,910
[Roll?]

102
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:06,580
You guys are all here?

103
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:10,470
[Starving family members all
gathering at the restaurant.]

104
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:12,230
I'll take some kimbap too, please.

105
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:14,740
Roll two more kimbap, please.

106
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,580
[You're saying 'Roll' again?]

107
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:24,190
He said 'roll' a little bit ago, and
now he just said the word, 'Roll' again.

108
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:26,620
- Roll up two kimbap, please.
- You're right.

109
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:28,220
He keeps saying the word, 'Roll'.

110
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:29,680
I think there's something
to that word, 'Roll'.

111
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:31,320
- Roll?
- Yeah.

112
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:34,220
Seriously stop what you're doing.

113
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:36,610
Why don't you just keep it to yourself
and just solve it on your own?

114
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:38,160
- Jae Suk...
- Seriously...

115
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,770
We have to talk things over
so that we can solve this.

116
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:44,490
- You're such a chatterbox!
- The owner kept saying the word, 'Roll'!

117
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:47,750
There was no need for him
to keep saying that word.

118
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,190
Roll...

119
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:51,530
Roll it?

120
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:53,330
That hurts.

121
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:55,680
Ji Hyo, that hurts.

122
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,350
[Asia's Giraffe getting his mane rolled?]

123
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:02,630
You look so pretty!

124

- This is...
- Customer...

125
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:08,950
- I think you did this for fun, but...
- Look at how wide your forehead is!

126
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:11,350
[Full exposure of his forehead
thanks to a morning perm service.]

127
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:16,150
Okay, let's roll it up.
How should I roll it up?

128
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:22,420
Don't you think that we need to solve it
before we start rolling it up?

129
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,010
If you roll it up like that...

130
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:27,940
[He wraps it around his finger...]

131
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:29,370
[After he wraps it around...
'Carefully'?]

132
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:34,940
[Fascinating how the words are
starting to form...]

133
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:38,720
I don't know,
but this kind of makes sense...

134
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:42,760
[No way...]

135
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:47,460
[Wrapping it around the magic marker
that was in the pencil case.]

136
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:54,010
[Si Won also arrives at the restaurant.]

137
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:55,800
- You came!
- Si Won, good to see you!

138
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,960
- What are you doing here?
- I came to find the treasure.

139
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,930
- You're searching for the treasure too?
- You know Si Won, don't you?

140
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:02,970
Of course, we do.

141
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:05,800
[Imitating Si Won's reactions.]

142
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:12,620
[Just then...]

143
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:15,950
Jung-gu...

144
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:17,820
Shindang-dong...

145
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:20,330
- There's got to be something here.
- I know. We need to roll it up.

146
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:22,770
Look at this.
Look at what happens when I roll it.

147
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:26,820
I got 'Jung-gu Shindang-dong 777'.

148
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,750
It says, 'Jung-gu Shindang-dong 777'.

149
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:36,990
[Jung-gu Shindang-dong 777]

150
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,810

00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:43,850
[Is this the address to
where the treasure is?]

152
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:46,200
- Why can't we all go together?
- I should wrap this around?

153
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:47,530
[He's already leaving?]

154
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:50,940
[The surprised look on his face
is pure Si Won.]

155
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:53,170
Jung-gu Shindang-dong 777...
is that right?

156
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:56,010
I think it's right.
Jung-gu Shindang-dong 777.

157
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,420
[Kkuk and Ro-Ro get in a cab.]

158
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:06,250
Jung-gu Shindang-dong 777.
Can you please take us there?

159
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,820
<i>777...</i>

160

This is awesome.

163
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:24,200
Don't cut it.
No, don't do it!

164
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:27,300
[Blank Ji cutting Kwang Soo's paper
in case it ruins the one she has.]

165
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,510
I was barely able to glue it back together,
and I can't believe you cut it again.

166
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:32,380
You rolled up my hair earlier too.

167
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,890
Then what was I supposed to do?
Undo my hair?

168
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:37,040
[Blank-Kwang siblings bickering with
one another first thing in the morning.]

169
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:41,160
[Let's roll it...
with Kwang Soo's paper...]

170
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,470
[Having rolled it up...]

171

00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:55,060
- You two are seriously...
- That's too strong of a hit!

508
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:56,860
[Oh!]

509
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:02,490
[Si Won's cap is closer to the line
by the split of a hair.]

510
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:04,380
It's okay, we have Gary.
Gary's good at things like this.

511
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:05,420
[He really is good...]

512
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:07,660
<i>Get it all the way up there.</i>

513
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:09,880
[Impala of the Green Team's turn.]
Good luck, Suk Jin.

514
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,300
Good... good!

515
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:12,410
[What!]

516
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:14,350
[Passes between the other two caps,
and gets ahead!]

517
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:16,940
[Impala currently stands in first place!]

518
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:18,320
<i>You can hit it out of there.</i>

519
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:23,610
- Okay, I can do this.
- You can do this.

520
00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:25,430
- Since I've always been an outsider...
- That's right.

521
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:28,240
[Gary's preparing to hit it from
the outermost spot?]

522
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,690
[Oh!]

523
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:36,270
[Closest to the finish line!]

524
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:37,600
- Yes! Yes!
- Yes, Gary!

525
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,760
[Showing his sometimes Mr. Capable
side of him again today!]

526
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:42,330
[At last, it's Jackie's turn.]

527
00:27:42,330 --> 00:27:43,580
Fighting!
Fighting!

528
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:44,930
[Blue Team's last ray of hope.]

529
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:47,180
<i>Jackie...</i>

530
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,730
[Will Jackie...]

531
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:52,730
[Get past all those bottle caps
to win the battle for his team?]

532
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,350
[All those countless items he's
thrown in his lifetime...]

533
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:04,480
[With the same feel for it
that he had back then...]

534
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,920
[Oh... it's getting close?]

535
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:21,510
[Ah... too bad!]

536
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:25,240
[Misses getting first place by a margin!]

537
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:29,930
<i>You just beat Jackie Chan!</i>

538
00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:34,030
- You just beat Jackie Chan!
- I won! I just beat Jackie Chan!

539
00:28:37,430 --> 00:28:40,240
Dong Hoon, just hit it.
It doesn't matter if you fall off.

540
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:42,340
[Will he get closer to the line
than Gary's?]

541
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:46,990
[Huh?]

542
00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:50,330
[What in the world?]

543
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:54,210
[Hits Jackie's in his path,
and hits his own cap off the table?]

544
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:57,610
[He just helped in pushing Jackie's cap
closer to the finish line!]

545
00:28:57,950 --> 00:28:59,460
[How can this be...]

546
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:03,850
[An event that can't repeat even if he
was to practice it a hundred times!]

547
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:07,120
[Panic]

548
00:29:08,890 --> 00:29:10,680
This is the power of Jackie Chan!

549
00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:15,490
[Jackie's bottle cap noticeably
closest to the finish line.]

550
00:29:16,650 --> 00:29:18,120
That's the power of Jackie Chan!

551
00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:19,490
- Good!
- Good!

552
00:29:19,490 --> 00:29:22,150
[Jackie Chan power?
Thanks to Ha Ha, Jackie lands in first place.]

553
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,080
- You can get going to your next location.
- Let's go!

554
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:27,300
What just happened?
It really felt like something out of a movie!

555
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:30,350
[As a sign of his gratitude, he
agrees to giving him his phone number?]

556
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:32,260
[Not forgetting to show his gratitude...]

557
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:35,170
Jackie, you really are the best!
This is why he's Jackie Chan!

558
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:37,020
How do you say...

559
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:38,770
- He says you're a spy.
- Spy... spy.

560
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,560
[You're now Jackie Chan's spy?]

561
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:45,260
<i>[Treasure Hunter- Go up to the rooftop.]</i>

562
00:29:45,710 --> 00:29:47,960
[Off to the rooftop!]

563
00:29:49,010 --> 00:29:51,530
- Then do we play between us?
- Ha Ha, thanks!

564
00:29:51,530 --> 00:29:52,780
Ha Ha, thanks!

565
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:57,310
[This is Jackie Chan's power!]

566
00:29:57,310 --> 00:29:58,790
- You're the best!
- So lucky!

567
00:29:59,810 --> 00:30:01,580
We were seriously so lucky!

568
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:05,430
[Wins three darts.]

569
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:07,130
I can't believe that happened!

570
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:09,770
[Heading up to the rooftop.]

571
00:30:09,770 --> 00:30:11,970
[With Jackie on their side,
it all seems like something out of a movie.]

572
00:30:11,970 --> 00:30:13,010
What is this?

573
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:15,440
What is this?

574
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,920
- What is this?
- What is all this?

575
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,500
[Stage 2]

576
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:20,310
[In middle of the rooftop...]

577
00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:23,440
[A shiatsu mat?]

578
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:31,560
[Could this be...]

579
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:34,790
- What this this?
- Could this be that thing...

580
00:30:34,790 --> 00:30:39,840
[If you can jump rope at least 10 times
on the shiatsu mat, you pass the mission.]

581
00:30:39,850 --> 00:30:42,730
[Drunken Master - 1979]

582
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:46,830
[Jackie, who's not known to walk
evenly along a flat surface with his moves.]

583
00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:52,120
[Countless number of jumps he's made
throughout all his years.]

584
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:55,510
[Something so simple as jump roping on
top of the shiatsu mat would be a cinch?]

585
00:30:55,510 --> 00:30:56,590
Jackie, this is...

586
00:30:56,590 --> 00:30:57,800
[Taking their shoes off...]

587
00:31:02,370 --> 00:31:03,580
This hurts.

588
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:05,670
[Good for the blood circulation.
Sending shocking sensations along their feet.]

589
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:08,350
[Toe separating socks...]

590
00:31:09,530 --> 00:31:11,790
Jackie... Jackie's socks...

591
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:14,100
Look at Jackie's socks.

592
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:15,200
You're so cute!

593
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,920
Jackie, you're so cute!

594
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:19,110
This hurts.

595
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:20,230
Ugh, this hurts.

596
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:22,700
[Jump roping on this mat...]

597
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:26,620
- How are we supposed to...
- How are we supposed to do this?

598
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:28,270
[Unable to even walk straight.]

599
00:31:29,570 --> 00:31:30,710
This hurts!

600
00:31:32,450 --> 00:31:33,770
[And downstairs...]

601
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:36,760
[Haroro this time...]

602
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:38,490
[Out!]

603
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,730
[Red Team wins!]

604
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:45,950
- Give me the darts!
- He has skills.

605
00:31:45,950 --> 00:31:47,100
Let's go!

606
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:49,660
Let's go, let's go!

607
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:51,440
How did Jackie...

608
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,710
[No matter how much they think about it,
what happened with Jackie is amazing?]

609
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:56,620
[Red Team wins themselves two darts.]

610
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:59,230
[Satisfied with winning second place.
Now up to the rooftop!]

611
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:03,620
Jackie... let's stand like this
with Ji Hyo in the middle.

612
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:04,860
- Okay.
- Okay.

613
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:06,470
We have to do it standing like this.

614
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:08,590
Move, let's change spots.

615
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:09,750
We're good at things like this.

616
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:12,550
[Muscles on the bottom of his feet too?
Walking with confidence.]

617
00:32:13,790 --> 00:32:16,430
We can start and Ji Hyo will jump in.
That's when the counting will start.

618
00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:18,660
- Oh...
- Jackie has toe separating socks on?

619
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:27,170
[Will they be able to jump rope
more than 10 times on the mat?]

620
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:29,220
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

621
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:31,770
<i>Set... go!</i>

622
00:32:37,550 --> 00:32:39,450
[Sending waves of shock throughout
their whole body!]

623
00:32:40,170 --> 00:32:42,390
[Even Jackie, the action star
cries out in pain!]

624
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:47,410
[The shocking sensation of
the shiatsu mat.]

625
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:52,110
That hurts!

626
00:32:52,110 --> 00:32:55,170
- It hurts without shoes.
- That really hurts!

627
00:32:55,810 --> 00:32:57,310
[Green Team also arrives on scene.]

628
00:32:57,310 --> 00:32:59,050
- It's a group jump rope.
- Jackie, you have to stand here.

629
00:32:59,790 --> 00:33:01,100
How do you do this?

630
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:02,700
I don't find it painful.

631
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:04,200
- You don't find it painful?
- No.

632
00:33:05,410 --> 00:33:06,950
- Jong Kook, I'm okay too.
- Right?

633
00:33:07,850 --> 00:33:10,840
[No problem!
The brothers feeling no pain.]

634
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,160
It feels okay to me.

635
00:33:13,910 --> 00:33:15,000
[They're no joke.]

636
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,830
I should've worn thicker socks.

637
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:19,160
[the brothers who feels no pain
up to take the challenge.]

638
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,970
One, two, three, go.

639
00:33:20,970 --> 00:33:22,650
[Will they...]

640
00:33:22,650 --> 00:33:24,410
[Huh?]

641
00:33:26,090 --> 00:33:28,220
[Not really feeling the shock,
but steps on the rope...]

642
00:33:29,130 --> 00:33:31,390
[Fail...]

643
00:33:31,390 --> 00:33:33,730
The moment you wind the rope, it's over.

644
00:33:33,730 --> 00:33:35,440
[Even though they argue it was practice,
they fail to convince others.]

645
00:33:35,450 --> 00:33:37,070
There are no practice swings.

646
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:38,520
[Darn...]

647
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:42,340
I was just practicing!

648
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:45,480
This isn't just a joke,
but with Jackie and his toe socks

649
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,130
he totally feels like a member of our team.

650
00:33:47,130 --> 00:33:49,220
[Jackie's appeal that makes him seem like
he's just an older brother to everyone.]

651
00:33:49,350 --> 00:33:51,280
<i>He just seems so friendly!</i>

652
00:33:51,870 --> 00:33:53,280
<i>- You want me to jump in?
- No, I'll jump in.</i>

653
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:55,910
[Traitor's club taking their turn.]

654
00:33:55,910 --> 00:33:57,420
- Why?
- I find this side more comfortable.

655
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,310
Why do we have to go with
your comfort?

656
00:34:03,550 --> 00:34:06,540
- Kwang Soo, you can turn around then.
- You're younger than me!

657
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:07,820
- Like this?
- That's right.

658
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:09,290
[What is this?]

659
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:13,450
[What kind of a starting position is this?]

660
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,330
[Jackie breaks out into laughter.]

661
00:34:17,330 --> 00:34:18,710
Jackie started laughing too.

662
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:22,930
[Even the world star finds the comedic antics
of the traitor's club entertaining.]

663
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:25,440
You really think this is going to work?

664
00:34:25,490 --> 00:34:27,280
Set... go!

665
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:31,530
[What is that...]

666
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:34,630
[Deformed strategy that's hard for
a normal person to understand.]

667
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,920
[Fail]

668
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,370
I can't do it that way!

669
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:43,860
[Screaming out in pain again after
piercing the palms of his hands.]

670
00:34:43,870 --> 00:34:47,470
<i>The space is too tight.
You have to make more room for me.</i>

671
00:34:47,470 --> 00:34:49,250
[The Blue Team makes their second attempt.]

672
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:50,710
- That really hurts.
- Jackie, we have to endure the pain.

673
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:52,590
- That's some serious stuff.
- Let's do it slow.

674
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:53,780
Slow?
Okay, I got it.

675
00:34:54,270 --> 00:34:57,390
- One, two...
- Three...

676
00:34:58,050 --> 00:35:00,740
Jackie just said to me, 'Slow...'

677
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:03,880

00:43:32,350 --> 00:43:35,290
[Treasure Hunter-
Go down to the third floor.]

849
00:43:35,620 --> 00:43:38,350
Jong Kook, I think our team is a great fit.

850
00:43:38,780 --> 00:43:43,070
[Red Team earns themselves
three darts.]

851
00:43:45,220 --> 00:43:46,300
Okay...

852
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:48,070
[The Blue Team's attempt.]

853
00:43:48,070 --> 00:43:49,450
Jackie, are you ready?
You're ready, right?

854
00:43:49,450 --> 00:43:51,330
[Will they succeed getting their
seven jumps this time?]

855
00:43:51,830 --> 00:43:54,760
One, two...

856
00:43:55,830 --> 00:43:57,080
Three, four...

857
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:58,940
[Oh! She jumped in!]

858
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:05,640
[Success]

859
00:44:06,740 --> 00:44:08,940
[The Blue Team finally succeeds!]

860
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:10,380
Ji Hyo, I knew you'd do it!

861
00:44:11,030 --> 00:44:12,110
We did it.

862
00:44:14,330 --> 00:44:15,550
[Wins more darts for their team!]

863
00:44:16,290 --> 00:44:17,910
Where do we have to go, Ji Hyo?

864
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:20,080
What happens to these three?

865
00:44:20,770 --> 00:44:23,230
[Worrying about the Traitors Club
as soon as he succeeds.]

866
00:44:23,230 --> 00:44:24,970
Jackie, this team has to keep trying.

867
00:44:25,670 --> 00:44:28,120
- Bye!
- Slow! Take your time!

868
00:44:30,020 --> 00:44:32,320
[Blaming each other's feet
for no reason.]

869
00:44:34,660 --> 00:44:37,560
[Earns two additional darts.]

870
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:41,650
You know that scene with the huge chandelier
in that giant shopping mall?

871
00:44:42,830 --> 00:44:44,470
- You did that yourself, right?
- Yeah.

872
00:44:44,470 --> 00:44:46,230
You don't get hurt doing that?

873
00:44:46,590 --> 00:44:48,460
You didn't get hurt?
Wasn't it painful?

874
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:49,830
Of course, it hurts!

875
00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:53,640
[It sounds as though he injured
his hands quite a bit.]

876
00:44:54,450 --> 00:44:57,800
[Their next mission location is a
woman's clothing store.]

877
00:44:58,350 --> 00:44:59,870
- Should we sit in the middle?
- Sure.

878
00:45:00,270 --> 00:45:03,070
- Is this coffee?
- Isn't this Caramel Macchiato?

879
00:45:04,750 --> 00:45:07,720
[Non-stop race.
Off to their next mission location.]

880
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:12,510
Hello.

881
00:45:16,650 --> 00:45:19,110
[Stage 3]

882
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:23,050
Jackie just showed us his hands real quick,
and they're just covered in scars!

883
00:45:23,050 --> 00:45:25,690
[Marks left by all the action sequences
he's performed throughout his years.]

884
00:45:25,940 --> 00:45:29,570
Jackie is famously known for doing
all his stunt himself.

885
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:33,110
Your movies always show the outtakes
at the end of the film.

886
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:36,360
[Extremely difficult and
dangerous action scenes.]

887
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:39,870
[The warning message not to imitate what's
being shown on screen is also included.]

888
00:45:39,870 --> 00:45:42,370
When I was little,
I thought that you were Korean.

889
00:45:42,370 --> 00:45:44,400
- Me too.
- That's right. Because of the dubbing.

890
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:47,610
<i>I thought you were a Korean who
just spoke really good Chinese.</i>

891
00:45:47,610 --> 00:45:48,710
<i>Especially because of his name too.</i>

892
00:45:48,710 --> 00:45:51,220
- That why I thought Bruce Lee...
- You thought that too?

893
00:45:51,220 --> 00:45:52,560
I thought Bruce Lee was Korean too
with his last name.

894
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:54,460
Do you ever get in touch with Sammo Hung?

895
00:45:55,750 --> 00:45:56,830
[Of course, I do.]

896
00:45:56,830 --> 00:45:58,240
- What about Yu Wang?
- Yu Wang too.

897
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:00,890
- We eat together all the time.
- Really?

898
00:46:00,930 --> 00:46:03,190
- Ah! I wish I could eat with him too!
- You're close to him like our group is!

899
00:46:03,190 --> 00:46:04,800
- Yeah, it's like our dynamics.
- They're close like we are.

900
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:06,770
What is Sammo Hung doing these days?

901
00:46:06,780 --> 00:46:07,990
He's a martial arts director.

902
00:46:07,990 --> 00:46:09,030
[Sammo Hung is currently working
as a martial arts director!]

903
00:46:09,030 --> 00:46:12,290
What about Duk Hwa?
Is he doing well these days?

904
00:46:12,620 --> 00:46:13,840
Yoo Duk Hwa.

905
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:15,550
Yoo Duk Hwa...
Yes, he's filming these days.

906
00:46:15,550 --> 00:46:18,480
- Oh, he's filming right now?
- They're all very similar to us!

907
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:21,310
We film overnight like they do
all the time!

908
00:46:21,310 --> 00:46:23,730
- If we do a fan meeting...
- You guys are all the same!

909
00:46:24,310 --> 00:46:25,700
You guys are all the same!

910
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:27,770
[How we all work to make a living
is all the same.]

911
00:46:31,900 --> 00:46:33,050
<i>You guys are all the same...</i>

912
00:46:33,060 --> 00:46:37,280
All these world stars eating and talking
while working like us...

913
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:38,880
- Filming...
- And getting together...

914
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:40,530
You're right, you're right.

915
00:46:40,530 --> 00:46:41,580
<i>I see...</i>

916
00:46:41,580 --> 00:46:43,920
There's something I've been wanting to
ask Jackie, but I haven't yet.

917
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:46,240
- About Man Ok, Jang Man Ok...
- Ah, Man Ok...

918
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:48,240
I really like Man Ok.

919
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:51,060
Right now...

920
00:46:51,870 --> 00:46:53,570
She's looking for a good script.

921
00:46:53,580 --> 00:46:55,500
<i>He said, she's looking for
a good script.</i>

922
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:58,080
[Jang Man Ok taking
some time off at the moment.]

923
00:46:58,080 --> 00:46:59,650
Vacation... she's taking a vacation.

924
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:01,940
It's really difficult these days to find
a script that would be popular worldwide.

925
00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:04,880
<i>It's really difficult these days to find
a script that would be popular worldwide.</i>

926
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:09,580
Jackie just said it's really tough to find a
script that would be popular worldwide.

927
00:47:10,970 --> 00:47:14,120
- The translator already told us that.
- Yeah, he already told us!

928
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:16,520
- When did he tell us that?
- He just told us right now.

929
00:47:18,630 --> 00:47:20,610
Seriously, you guys have no sense!

930
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:25,350
When I see Jackie,
I'm most reminded of 'Drunken Master'.

931
00:47:25,350 --> 00:47:28,280
- But that was from so long ago.
- You're really strange for your age.

932
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,240
You're most reminded of 'Drunken Master'?

933
00:47:30,250 --> 00:47:32,460
You have to be at least 39 years old
to know that movie.

934
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:35,710
Whenever I open my mouth,
you guys all attack me like piranis.

935
00:47:35,710 --> 00:47:37,460
Piranhas, you meant to say piranhas.

936
00:47:37,460 --> 00:47:40,000
It's not 'pirani' but 'piranhas'!

937
00:47:40,010 --> 00:47:43,720
- You're supposed to say piranhas.
- Jackie, do you see Kwang Soo over there?

938
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:46,100
How old do you think Kwang Soo is?

939
00:47:46,580 --> 00:47:48,790
- Be really honest.
- 45 years old?

940
00:47:53,750 --> 00:47:55,100
[You're not?]

941
00:47:55,100 --> 00:47:56,880
- 45 years old?
- Are you being serious?

942
00:47:59,170 --> 00:48:00,520
Okay, 50?
50 years old?

943
00:48:04,740 --> 00:48:06,360
<i>45 years old...</i>

944
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:10,510
<i>Are you guys all having fun
chatting and talking to each other?</i>

945
00:48:11,590 --> 00:48:13,390
<i>[Alarm talk-
The next game is alarm talk.]</i>

946
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:16,360
<i>[The game is played by asking and
answering questions to each other.]</i>

947
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:18,020
<i>[If the alarm sounds,
then the person is disqualified.]</i>

948
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:19,430
What does this mean?

949
00:48:19,430 --> 00:48:23,850
<i>If Kim Jong Kook was to start the game,
he'd have to set the time to begin.</i>

950
00:48:24,490 --> 00:48:26,660
So it's like 'The Time Bomb'?

951
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:32,700
[If the alarm sounds like in the movie,
'The Time Bomb'...]

952
00:48:32,870 --> 00:48:37,030
[The person who's holding the cellphone
at that moment is disqualified.]

953
00:48:40,950 --> 00:48:42,660
- Okay.
- This sounds like fun.

954
00:48:42,710 --> 00:48:44,260
This game sounds like fun.

955
00:48:44,260 --> 00:48:45,900
<i>You have to mix-up the seating.</i>

956
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:48,090
[Team members to mix-up the seating.]

957
00:48:50,820 --> 00:48:52,810
In the end, you and I
get to sit next to one another.

958
00:48:52,910 --> 00:48:55,400
[Hm... no kidding?]

959
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:58,350
- In the end...
- No kidding? Maybe they're destined.

960
00:48:58,350 --> 00:49:00,120
[Every Monday, they're
drawn to each other like magnets.]

961
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:02,280
- That's just so strange.
- Just accept it.

962
00:49:02,810 --> 00:49:06,570
<i>You don't have to go in order.
Ask the question to whomever you'd like.</i>

963
00:49:06,580 --> 00:49:08,100
Did you tell Jackie?

964
00:49:08,100 --> 00:49:10,900
Did you explain the game to Jackie?
Did you explain how it's played?

965
00:49:10,900 --> 00:49:12,710
I know!
I'm smart.

966
00:49:16,710 --> 00:49:18,710
[Kkuk deciding what he should set the time for
between 20 seconds and two minutes.]

967
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:23,290
- Okay, I'm ready to go.
- Show the time to the camera.

968
00:49:25,830 --> 00:49:27,260
[20 seconds!]

969
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:29,620
He's always doing things like that.

970
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:34,120
- Suk Jin...
- Yeah?

971
00:49:35,170 --> 00:49:37,560
[Stalling for time...]

972
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:41,270
How's your business going?

973
00:49:41,270 --> 00:49:43,540
- Business is...
- You have to hand him your phone now.

974
00:49:43,540 --> 00:49:45,370
The business is going really well.

975
00:49:46,050 --> 00:49:47,780
How are you doing?
How's your dating life?

976
00:49:49,530 --> 00:49:52,440
[Huh? Back to Jong Kook?]

977
00:49:53,380 --> 00:49:55,210
[Flustered]

978
00:49:55,210 --> 00:49:57,100
I'm okay.
How are things at home?

979
00:49:57,100 --> 00:49:58,500
[The time!]

980
00:50:00,890 --> 00:50:02,810
[The alarm sounds!]

981
00:50:02,810 --> 00:50:04,990
- He got played by his own trick!
- Can he pass it back to me like that?

982
00:50:04,990 --> 00:50:06,560
- Of course!
- Why can't he?

983
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:08,350
What the heck are you doing?

984
00:50:10,870 --> 00:50:12,570
[Red Team's Kkuk is eliminated!]

985
00:50:13,950 --> 00:50:16,600
<i>Impala, Impala!
Impala is still alive!</i>

986
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:20,110
[Impala's counterattack is a success!]

987
00:50:20,110 --> 00:50:24,180
Jong Kook and what he was planning...
I noticed what he was trying to do.

988
00:50:25,250 --> 00:50:26,620
[Jackie's tissue pack...]

989
00:50:31,670 --> 00:50:35,220
[This man really is...]

990
00:50:39,670 --> 00:50:41,880
This really is amazing.

991
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:46,030
[To be sitting right next to Jackie Chan
like he is right now...]

992
00:50:46,660 --> 00:50:48,880
<i>He's totally fallen
head over heels in love.</i>

993
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:50,480
I'm so deliriously happy right now.

994
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:53,170
I love him more than any other woman,
I'm being really serious.

995
00:50:57,080 --> 00:50:58,110
[Hurry up and restart the game!]

996
00:50:59,090 --> 00:51:00,740
He's not even looking in your direction.

997
00:51:01,950 --> 00:51:04,440
[Jackie is too focused on playing the game.]

998
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:06,600
[Setting the time limit.]

999
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:08,260
- Hurry up and do it!
- Oh my goodness!

1000
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:10,340
- Hurry up and do it!
- Oh my goodness!

1001
00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:13,070
You scared me.

1002
00:51:13,590 --> 00:51:17,130
[Between the allotted 20 seconds- 2 minutes,
what's the time limit he set it for?]

1003
00:51:17,130 --> 00:51:20,120
Seriously... I seriously admire you so much.

1004
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:23,140
Honestly... how are you so handsome?

1005
00:51:23,140 --> 00:51:24,490
- How?
- What?

1006
00:51:24,490 --> 00:51:26,300
How can you be so attractive?

1007
00:51:27,410 --> 00:51:29,200
Exercise every day.

1008
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:31,820
Exercise.
Do you exercise every day?

1009
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:34,080
Yes.

1010
00:51:35,630 --> 00:51:41,450
- I breathe... I walk, I jog, run, you know?
- Good.

1011
00:51:41,450 --> 00:51:43,850
Your nose... your nose that you have...

1012
00:51:43,850 --> 00:51:45,730
- Your hook nose...
- Hurry!

1013
00:51:45,730 --> 00:51:48,450
Is it like your dad's nose,
or your mom's nose?

1014
00:51:49,870 --> 00:51:51,890
- Dad... like my dad.
- Your dad.

1015
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:55,560
Why... um... do you have a girlfriend?

1016
00:51:55,570 --> 00:51:56,970
[Girlfriend?]

1017
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:00,090
[Hm?]

1018
00:52:01,530 --> 00:52:03,290
- No, I don't have one.
- What's your answer, Si Won?

1019
00:52:04,730 --> 00:52:09,410
- Are you happily married?
- It's almost a sin how happy I am.

1020
00:52:10,740 --> 00:52:12,300
- Kwang Soo...
- Me?

1021
00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:14,270
We're on the same team!

1022
00:52:14,570 --> 00:52:15,770
[Oh yeah!]

1023
00:52:15,770 --> 00:52:17,030
Kwang Soo...

1024
00:52:17,890 --> 00:52:19,690
- Who's better looking?
- Jackie...

1025
00:52:25,190 --> 00:52:27,280
[Green Team's Kwang Soo - Out!]

1026
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:29,650
- Why did you give it to your own team?
- What the heck?

1027
00:52:29,650 --> 00:52:31,900
Impala, Impala...

1028
00:52:33,340 --> 00:52:36,700
Impala, Impala!
Impala is still alive!

1029
00:52:37,340 --> 00:52:39,220
<i>Why did you do that to me?</i>

1030
00:52:39,260 --> 00:52:41,220
- Just come over here!
- Jong Kook...

1031
00:52:41,220 --> 00:52:43,660
Can you at least give us a dart
for ousting our own team member?

1032
00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:46,540
So I'm not supposed to give it
to my own team member, huh?

1033
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:52,280
Jackie really likes the Green Team.

1034
00:52:53,830 --> 00:52:55,240
<i>They're a funny team.</i>

1035
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:56,840
<i>Not the winning team,
but the funny team.</i>

1036
00:52:56,910 --> 00:53:00,000
[Big-nosed Brother sets the
time limit again.]

1037
00:53:00,770 --> 00:53:04,360
Seriously though, Yoo Jae Suk...
have you met Jackie before today?

1038
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:09,340
Yes, of course.
Starting from the 80's to 90's...

1039
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:12,390
There's not a single movie that Jackie
has been in that I haven't seen.

1040
00:53:12,570 --> 00:53:17,720
Starting from the 'Drunken Master' to
'Police Story' to the recent 'Tuxedo'...

1041
00:53:18,090 --> 00:53:19,430
Hurry!

1042
00:53:21,690 --> 00:53:24,880
- Then Ji Hyo...
- Me?

1043
00:53:26,180 --> 00:53:28,680
[A team member picking someone from
his own team again?]

1044
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:32,810
- You're in a new drama, aren't you?
- Yes, I'm starting a new drama soon.

1045
00:53:33,550 --> 00:53:35,730
I'll be starting a historical drama soon.

1046
00:53:35,730 --> 00:53:37,910
[Everyone seems so relaxed
about the time they're taking?]

1047
00:53:37,910 --> 00:53:40,260
You know how I can do my shopping
here right now?

1048
00:53:40,260 --> 00:53:42,050
- What's the role you'll be playing?
- Why are you asking the question?

1049
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:47,630
- You can ask when it's your turn.
- I guess I'm just always curious about you.

1050
00:53:48,150 --> 00:53:50,640
Kang Gary, if you had to pick...

1051
00:53:51,410 --> 00:53:54,620
what clothes do you want to see me wear?
You have to choose the top and bottom.

1052
00:53:54,620 --> 00:53:57,890
Why don't you pick the full outfit for me?

1053
00:53:57,890 --> 00:54:00,150
- For Song Ji Hyo...
- Hurry up!

1054
00:54:00,150 --> 00:54:02,720
There's no need for you to wear
a top or a bottom.

1055
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:05,250
- When it comes to Song Ji Hyo...
- Hurry, Gary! The time's almost up!

1056
00:54:05,250 --> 00:54:08,020
- Song Ji Hyo natural beauty...
- I said, it's almost time! Hurry!

1057
00:54:08,020 --> 00:54:11,610
- Song Ji Hyo is...
- What are you trying to say I am?

1058
00:54:11,610 --> 00:54:13,640
She is just like a flower.

1059
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:15,930
She's a flower...

1060
00:54:16,550 --> 00:54:18,830
[Running out of time!]

1061
00:54:18,830 --> 00:54:20,720
How tall are you, Ha Ha?

1062
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:23,150
I'm 143cm tall!

1063
00:54:23,150 --> 00:54:25,960
- How tall are you?
- I'm 183cm. What about your weight?

1064
00:54:26,300 --> 00:54:28,810
69 kg?
How about...

1065
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:34,820
[Green Team's Ha Ha is ousted!]

1066
00:54:36,030 --> 00:54:38,380
[The Traitors Club is getting
eliminated one by one.]

1067
00:54:41,100 --> 00:54:43,940
Ji Hyo, do you ever think about
dating Gary?

1068
00:54:43,940 --> 00:54:45,600
<i>That's a really good question.</i>

1069
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:48,210
Your question about Gary...
I'll think about it later.

1070
00:54:48,210 --> 00:54:49,620
[Huh? Later?]

1071
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:50,900
<i>What the heck does that mean?</i>

1072
00:54:50,900 --> 00:54:53,890
I'll think about that later.
What about you? Do you want to date me?

1073
00:54:53,890 --> 00:54:55,560
What's going on between those two?

1074
00:54:55,960 --> 00:55:01,850
Instead of thinking about it later,
can you give me an 'X' or 'O' answer now?

1075
00:55:02,780 --> 00:55:04,340
[Passes the phone back to her.]

1076
00:55:05,530 --> 00:55:07,040
[What is he saying?]

1077
00:55:07,050 --> 00:55:09,890
<i>Can you give me an 'X' or 'O'
answer now?</i>

1078
00:55:11,530 --> 00:55:14,360
- What are you two doing right now?
- Might as well get an answer right now!

1079
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:17,540
I'll think about it when you bring me
a three carat diamond ring.

1080
00:55:17,540 --> 00:55:20,530
[Huh? That diamond ring
from that other time?]

1081
00:55:20,530 --> 00:55:22,510
Keep... okay?

1082
00:55:22,510 --> 00:55:24,620
[The diamond ring she asked him
to keep in Macau?]

1083
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:27,510
Keep the name, Kang Gary.

1084
00:55:27,510 --> 00:55:30,460
- Kang... Mr. Kang.
- Yes, it's for Ji Hyo.

1085
00:55:30,460 --> 00:55:33,710
[If he's to bring the ring that was asked
to be kept for Blank Ji?]

1086
00:55:34,860 --> 00:55:37,250
[How much was that again?]

1087
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:41,220
I'll think about it when you bring me
a three carat diamond ring.

1088
00:55:41,220 --> 00:55:44,730
- What are you two doing right now?
- The three carat diamond...

1089
00:55:47,870 --> 00:55:50,060
[The Blue Team's Ji Hyo is out!]

1090
00:55:50,560 --> 00:55:53,460
- Ji Hyo!
- That happened because of the diamond!

1091
00:55:54,070 --> 00:55:58,020
- It's because you asked for an answer!
- You should've just quickly done the 'O'.

1092
00:55:58,020 --> 00:56:00,870
Seriously, what are these two doing?

1093
00:56:00,870 --> 00:56:03,480
[Si Won's reaction time.]
- You thought about it too long, Ji Hyo.

[Gary setting the time limit]

1096
00:56:10,850 --> 00:56:16,280
My respected Jackie...
when is your next movie?

1097
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:20,530
Can you please tell us about
your next movie?

1098
00:56:20,530 --> 00:56:22,370
I'm very curious to know.

1099
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:25,640
Gary... that was kind of cool.

1100
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:27,260
- And...
- You sound like a reporter.

1101
00:56:27,260 --> 00:56:28,690
How you're asking the question is...

1102
00:56:28,690 --> 00:56:35,100
And the type of movies that you're making,
what are your thoughts on it?

1103

<i>You sound like you're interviewing him!</i>

1104
00:56:36,590 --> 00:56:41,200
- It's Reporter Gae!
- I respect you very much as an actor.

1105
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:43,940
And you mentioned that you
work out every day.

1106
00:56:43,940 --> 00:56:46,170
How many hours per day
do you work out?

1107
00:56:46,810 --> 00:56:51,440
- Those are nice questions.
- Just answer one of those questions, please.

1108
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:53,540
[It seems as though his questions alone
took a full minute to be asked.]

1109
00:56:55,020 --> 00:57:00,940
The current movie I'm working on is about
searching around the world for a treasure.

1110
00:57:00,940 --> 00:57:03,510
[A nice and short answer
to a very long question.]

1111
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:07,250
How old were you when you started
watching my movies, Gary?

1112
00:57:07,260 --> 00:57:10,930
And out of all the movies you like,
list your 10 favorite movies.

1113
00:57:10,930 --> 00:57:13,010
<i>List 10 of your favorite movies
that he's been in.</i>

that he's been in.</i>

[Retaliating in the same method.]

1116
00:57:20,120 --> 00:57:21,540
If you can't list 10 questions,
you fail your turn.

1117
00:57:21,540 --> 00:57:22,880
'Rush Hour'...

1118
00:57:22,990 --> 00:57:25,080
Rush Hour... Rush Hour!

00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:27,050
[Gary, out!]

1120
00:57:28,530 --> 00:57:31,090
Jackie Chan...
Jackie Chan is still alive!

1121
00:57:33,610 --> 00:57:35,760
- He's the best!
- He's a genius.

That was the best.
Jackie Chan is the best.

The next time you're in Hong Kong,
let's go grab a meal together.

1125
00:57:51,990 --> 00:57:53,390
I'll introduce you to a lot of my friends.

1126
00:57:53,390 --> 00:57:56,560
- The next time you're in Hong Kong...
- He called him Mr. Impala.

1127
00:57:57,230 --> 00:57:59,240
He said he'll take you out to dinner.

1128
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:00,930
I'd be so grateful!

1129
00:58:03,180 --> 00:58:05,710
[Mr. Impala, out!]

1130
00:58:05,710 --> 00:58:07,330
Thank you!

in at last place?

[The last three people left remaining.]

1135

[What will he set the time limit for?]

1136
00:58:34,740 --> 00:58:36,430
You guys are like his subjects now.

1137
00:58:36,430 --> 00:58:38,080
Jackie Chan's subjects.

1138
00:58:39,150 --> 00:58:44,060
If we were to work on a movie together,
what genre would you like to work on?

1139
00:58:44,060 --> 00:58:45,930
A martial arts or a Kung Fu movie?

1140
00:58:45,930 --> 00:58:50,410
- If you're to shoot a movie with him...
- Me too! I want to do it too!

1141
00:58:52,260 --> 00:58:54,240
I'd like anything.
Anything would be great.

1142
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:57,970
Jae Suk, who do you think is
the best MC in our country?

1143
00:59:03,310 --> 00:59:06,730
[A little difficult of a question to
answer in his position?]

1144

[Jae Suk, out!]

1146
00:59:17,930 --> 00:59:19,920
- That question was..
- That was good!

1147
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:21,610
- I should've passed it on!
- Si Won, that was good!

1148
00:59:21,610 --> 00:59:24,980
[We should've heard his answer...]

1149
00:59:24,980 --> 00:59:26,730
That was a difficult question
for him to answer.

1150
00:59:26,730 --> 00:59:28,800
[The final face-off:
Jackie Chan vs. Si Won.]

1151
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:30,810
Jackie is very good at this game.

1153
00:59:32,690 --> 00:59:34,590
[Very good at asking
ambush attack questions.]

1154
00:59:34,590 --> 00:59:39,420
[And counterattack questions.]

1155
00:59:40,760 --> 00:59:42,270
<i>You have to list the ten movies!</i>

1156
00:59:42,900 --> 00:59:45,670
[And Reaction Si Won who's not
an easy opponent to play against.]

1157
00:59:46,700 --> 00:59:49,180
[Which one of the two will come out a victor?]

1158
00:59:49,180 --> 00:59:52,310
With all the fans you have in Korea,
will you be coming back often?

1159
00:59:53,060 --> 00:59:54,110
Yes, yes.

1160
00:59:54,110 --> 00:59:56,430
Since I've made all these good friends now,
I'll be back to visit often.

1161
00:59:56,430 --> 00:59:59,120
<i>He said he'll be back to visit often
since he's made good friends with all of you.</i>

1162
00:59:59,750 --> 01:00:03,480
It would be nice if you took me out
to dinner every time I came to visit.

1163
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:05,520
<i>He says he hopes you'll take him out
to dinner every time he comes to visit.</i>

1164
01:00:05,530 --> 01:00:07,170
Of course, of course!

1165
01:00:07,170 --> 01:00:11,240
The next time Super Junior sings,
I'd like to sing together with them.

1166
01:00:11,240 --> 01:00:13,550
I'd like to sing along to the
Korean songs...

1167
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:16,490
[Not much time left on the clock!]

1168
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:20,500
How many members are there
in Super Junior?

1169
01:00:20,500 --> 01:00:23,250
- How many members in Super Junior?
- There are nine of us working.

1170
01:00:23,250 --> 01:00:26,730
Are you planning on putting out
an album yourself?

1171
01:00:29,090 --> 01:00:31,970
I'll tell you about that
when I return to Hong Kong.

1172
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:36,480
Want to choose a song to work on
together the next time you're in Beijing?

1173
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:38,020
[Running out of time!]

1174
01:00:45,260 --> 01:00:47,120
[Si Won, out!]

1175
01:00:47,980 --> 01:00:50,390
[By the split of a hair!]

1176
01:00:51,550 --> 01:00:53,490
[Pretty amazing!]

1177
01:00:55,140 --> 01:01:01,360
Jackie Chan is still alive!
Jackie Chan is still alive!

1178
01:01:03,650 --> 01:01:06,060
[Wins the team three darts!]

1179
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:11,810
[Treasure Hunter-
Finally off to Stage Four!]

1180
01:01:11,810 --> 01:01:16,980
<i>[The first team to collect seven masks
out of 12 is the winner.]</i>

1181
01:01:17,370 --> 01:01:22,710
[Time for Jackie's real action!
A real chase mission!]

1182
01:01:23,460 --> 01:01:26,290
<i>There are areas designated for
each team to take their position in.</i>

1183
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:28,830
<i>In the four floors below,
including this one.</i>

1184
01:01:30,780 --> 01:01:37,400
<i>The first team to collect the seven masks
while evading other teams, is the winner.</i>

1185
01:01:37,410 --> 01:01:43,190
[Masks representing the 12 signs of zodiac.
First team to collect seven wins!]

1186
01:01:45,770 --> 01:01:47,590
[Red Team finds their position mark.]

1187
01:01:49,840 --> 01:01:51,720
So we have to find the masks
and gather them up here?

1188
01:01:51,720 --> 01:01:53,960
- They can't take it from there, right?
- No, they'll take it.

1189
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:55,060
Really?

1190
01:01:55,960 --> 01:01:57,640
- This is our spot.
- Our team spot.

1191
01:01:58,850 --> 01:02:02,350
Once we set them here, other
teams will come and try to steal them.

1192
01:02:02,350 --> 01:02:04,550
So we have to stop them while
gathering all the masks we can.

1193
01:02:07,570 --> 01:02:08,930
[Huh?]

1194
01:02:08,930 --> 01:02:12,350
[No, you have to find a tiger Mask...]

1195
01:02:12,790 --> 01:02:14,080
We have to find the masks.

1196
01:02:15,960 --> 01:02:18,950
[Green Team also finds their position.]

1197
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:20,870
- Let's go down.
- There it is. There's a mask over there.

1198
01:02:20,870 --> 01:02:22,110
What is that?

1199
01:02:23,160 --> 01:02:25,760
[Wait... that's...]

1200
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:29,260
[That is a mask, but which one of the
12 zodiac signs is that supposed to be?]

1201
01:02:29,260 --> 01:02:31,650
- Is there a rabbit in the zodiac?
- This is a rabbit?

1202
01:02:31,650 --> 01:02:33,090
Isn't it a grasshopper?

1203
01:02:33,090 --> 01:02:34,170
Just keep it for now.

1204
01:02:34,170 --> 01:02:37,350
[That's a grasshopper.
Fake masks are placed everywhere too!]

1205
01:02:38,440 --> 01:02:40,200
<i>I don't see anything...</i>

1206
01:02:42,360 --> 01:02:43,860
What to do?

1207
01:02:45,850 --> 01:02:51,370
[Jackie checking all the stores
with a fine toothed comb.]

1208
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:55,520
[Huh? There's something back there!]

1209
01:02:56,450 --> 01:02:59,790
[Blue Team's Jackie discovers
the mask of the Dog!]

1210
01:03:00,640 --> 01:03:04,590
[All his detailed searching pays off!]

1211
01:03:08,970 --> 01:03:13,740
[Ace Ji Hyo finds the mask of a Ram
from the floor below!]

1212
01:03:16,710 --> 01:03:19,330
[Hiding it away from
other team's prying eyes.]

1213
01:03:21,130 --> 01:03:24,300
[Jackie also comes back with
the Dog mask in hand.]

1214
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:28,730
[Needs to gather seven to win.
The Blue Team already has two.]

1215
01:03:29,190 --> 01:03:30,690
You're the best!

1216
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:35,440
[Huh? Why is he pulling out the
Ram mask Ji Hyo just hid away?]

1217
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:38,390
[So detailed!
Jackie making sure to hide it carefully.]

1218
01:03:40,380 --> 01:03:42,070
Two... we have two!

1219
01:03:46,050 --> 01:03:49,830
[Giraffe having found a giraffe mask,
which isn't even one of the signs.]

1220
01:03:50,560 --> 01:03:53,830
[One of the masks are hidden away?
The Horse mask is up on the shelf!]

1221
01:03:57,680 --> 01:04:00,210
[With Giraffe on their team,
tall shelves are not a problem!]

1222
01:04:00,210 --> 01:04:02,580
[Giraffe proving himself to be useful.]

1223
01:04:03,080 --> 01:04:05,720
- There's no sign of the giraffe.
- Throw away that giraffe.

1224
01:04:05,720 --> 01:04:08,780
- I don't want to throw it away.
- Then put it down somewhere for now.

1225
01:04:08,780 --> 01:04:10,370
[Love for his giraffe character.]

1226
01:04:10,380 --> 01:04:12,650
I want to take this and keep it forever.

1227
01:04:13,300 --> 01:04:16,980
[On the other hand...]

1228
01:04:17,690 --> 01:04:22,270
[Si Won loitering around other teams' areas
rather than searching for the masks.]

1229
01:04:22,270 --> 01:04:24,140
Is this the Blue Team?

1230
01:04:25,170 --> 01:04:27,620
[Starting to search the Blue Team's area.]

1231
01:04:28,750 --> 01:04:32,380
[Behind that curtain is...]

1232
01:04:33,860 --> 01:04:37,670
[Discovers the Ram and the Dog
Jackie and Ace hid away!]

1233
01:04:39,240 --> 01:04:44,060

[Red Teams Si Won succeeds in
stealing away two masks!]

01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:11,730
[Haroro attacking Jackie after
being attacked and stolen from.]

1240
01:05:11,730 --> 01:05:13,290
Jackie stole a mask from me!

1241
01:05:13,690 --> 01:05:16,050
[Easily slips away from Suk Jin's block.]

1242
01:05:16,180 --> 01:05:18,380
Stop it!
Don't come after us!

1243
01:05:18,940 --> 01:05:21,430
[Impala and Haroro becoming more
exhausted than Jackie seems to be.]

1244
01:05:24,030 --> 01:05:26,630
[Blue Team's Jae Suk bringing back
the Dragon he discovered.]

1245
01:05:26,630 --> 01:05:30,910
[Realizes that the masks they hid away
have been stolen!]

1246
01:05:30,910 --> 01:05:32,310
Someone stole our masks.

1247
01:05:35,120 --> 01:05:36,900
[Jae Suk sneaks up on Green Team's area.]

1248
01:05:36,900 --> 01:05:38,430
<i>Kwang Soo, come over here.</i>

01:05:41,450 --> 01:05:44,330
[Jae Suk steals the Horse away
from the Green Team!]

1250
01:05:45,560 --> 01:05:46,580
No!

1251
01:05:47,870 --> 01:05:50,330
[It seemed Jae Suk may get away
with his thievery...]

1252
01:05:50,330 --> 01:05:53,410
[But of all things,
he has to run into the Red Team?]

1253
01:05:56,370 --> 01:06:00,510
[The chaos... finally ensues!]

1254
01:06:07,540 --> 01:06:09,760
[The desperation to steal at least
one more mask for their own team.]

1255
01:06:15,110 --> 01:06:19,250
[Everyone scatters after the ownership
of the masks has been changed.]

1256
01:06:21,750 --> 01:06:23,300
Give it back to me!

[Discovers the Rooster that
Jackie hid away!]

1261
01:06:34,300 --> 01:06:36,010
- Jae Suk, where are you?
- Over here!

in the blink of an eye!]

the way first...]

[Protecting the masks and Ji Hyo by
shoving them both under the table.]

1269
01:07:01,740 --> 01:07:04,740
Grab Jackie!

[At that moment, Si Won from the Red Team
succeeds in stealing away the Snake!]

01:07:19,250 --> 01:07:20,580
<i>They stole it.</i>

1274
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:24,550
We had it stolen!
We no longer have the Snake.

1275
01:07:27,480 --> 01:07:30,130
- How many?
- Two... we only have two.

1276
01:07:30,130 --> 01:07:31,690
[Blue Team only left with two...]

1277
01:07:31,690 --> 01:07:34,630
[But if it hadn't been for Jackie,
they may have lost all the masks...]

1278
01:07:35,990 --> 01:07:38,710
[Okay... you just wait and see.]

1279
01:07:43,650 --> 01:07:48,020
[Giraffe walking towards the
Red Team's home turf.]

1280
01:07:53,270 --> 01:07:55,210
Where are you going?
Where do you think you're going?

1281
01:07:55,210 --> 01:07:59,230
[Mr. Capable forcing him to a stop.
The masks must be hidden here somewhere!]

1282
01:07:59,230 --> 01:08:02,830
- Dong Hoon!
- You can't! Si Won!

1283
01:08:02,830 --> 01:08:04,550

like a bolt of lightning.]

1285
01:08:07,780 --> 01:08:10,260
- Hide it elsewhere.
- Suk Jin! Hurry!

1286
01:08:12,120 --> 01:08:17,300
[Seeing how he's blocking the stairs,
it seems the masks are hidden upstairs!]

1287
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,950
[Getting up there from the front
is not the idea...]

1288
01:08:22,950 --> 01:08:25,740
[How about going up from the back?]

1289
01:08:27,580 --> 01:08:30,040
[I'll go up the ladder!]

1290
01:08:32,370 --> 01:08:35,290
- Jong Kook, it's me... your little brother!
- No, Kwang Soo.

1291
01:08:35,660 --> 01:08:38,910
- Why do you keep pushing me away?
- I can't let you go, Kwang Soo.

1292

[Jae Suk succeeds in safely stealing away
the Red Team's Monkey mask!]

1293
01:08:48,810 --> 01:08:50,270
What are you doing down there?

1294
01:08:51,280 --> 01:08:53,350
- I'm waiting for my turn to steal.
- Okay, hang on.

1295
01:08:55,990 --> 01:08:57,150

Hey!
Help me!

01:09:23,530 --> 01:09:28,620
[Secretly hiding away the mask in
the store next to their site.]

1304
01:09:31,280 --> 01:09:34,300
[Red Team's storage that's been
compromised.]

1305
01:09:34,300 --> 01:09:35,860
- Here they are!
- Up there?

1306
01:09:35,860 --> 01:09:38,450
[Red Team in danger!
They may be robbed empty at this rate!]

1307
01:09:43,610 --> 01:09:45,260
[I should get up there.]

1308
01:09:46,470 --> 01:09:48,540

Jae Suk is going up.</i>

1309

1310
01:09:53,800 --> 01:09:56,800
[A fierce battle between all three teams!]

1311
01:09:56,800 --> 01:09:58,380
Throw it down, Kwang Soo!

1312
01:09:58,380 --> 01:10:00,680
- Kwang Soo, throw it down!
- Throw it down here!

1313
01:10:02,780 --> 01:10:05,010
- Kwang Soo, throw it down here!
- You're doing great!

1314

[Barely gets away to throw it down...]

1315
01:10:09,790 --> 01:10:11,820
[Huh?]

1316
01:10:11,820 --> 01:10:14,160
[To get stuck up there...]

1317
01:10:18,750 --> 01:10:21,890
[Throws it down to Jackie of the Blue Team?]

1318
01:10:21,890 --> 01:10:24,480
[Jackie does it again!]

1319

[When it comes to the decisive moment,
he's always there waiting!]

1320
01:10:35,670 --> 01:10:38,060
- Jackie is being very Jackie-esque.
- What do we do?

1321
01:10:38,060 --> 01:10:40,670

[Red Team having gathered a total of
five masks with Si Won's Snake mask.]

stop from all the thievery!]

1324
01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:55,190
[The five mask bundle is complete!]

1325
01:10:57,560 --> 01:10:59,460
What are you hiding up there?

1326
01:10:59,890 --> 01:11:01,090
[I saw everything.]

1327
01:11:01,090 --> 01:11:03,100
What are you doing?
Are you running away?

1328
01:11:03,620 --> 01:11:05,610
- You're trying to escape?
- Gary...

1329
01:11:05,610 --> 01:11:07,570
- What are you doing?
- What are you hiding up there?

1330
01:11:08,110 --> 01:11:10,740
- No, I'm not hiding anything.
- You're saying that's not hiding anything?

1331
01:11:10,740 --> 01:11:12,640
- What are you saying?
- I see you're hiding things up there.

1332
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:14,790
- It's just so messy up here...
- Really?

1333
01:11:14,790 --> 01:11:16,430
- I'm just organizing up here.
- Is that so?

1334
01:11:17,700 --> 01:11:19,630
- Gary...
- Hey, Gary!

1335
01:11:19,630 --> 01:11:21,500
What are you doing?

1336
01:11:22,230 --> 01:11:24,790
[Shoving them down like a bulldozer.]

1337
01:11:25,500 --> 01:11:29,780
[Red Team not about to be had
like they were earlier.]

1338
01:11:29,780 --> 01:11:31,570
Why are you standing around here?

1339
01:11:32,240 --> 01:11:35,420
[Jae Suk and Kwang Soo in the end
turning away from their goal.]

1340
01:11:35,420 --> 01:11:38,560
[Firmly protecting their loot.]

1341
01:11:39,340 --> 01:11:41,740
I'll bring it down all at once.
I have them all bundled up together.

1342
01:11:43,060 --> 01:11:47,350
[Slowly starting to reform their plans
to protect the masks they already have.]

1343
01:11:47,850 --> 01:11:50,060
- Jackie, how many do we have?
- We have four right now.

1344
01:11:50,060 --> 01:11:52,100
We need to get three more then.

1345
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:55,600
We have four right now,
and we need to go get three more.

1346
01:11:56,700 --> 01:12:00,500
[No end in sight to staying there,
and too nervous to go back out...]

1347
01:12:00,500 --> 01:12:03,190
[Jae Suk ultimately deciding to
go back out to hunt.]

1348
01:12:03,540 --> 01:12:04,890
- Ji Hyo...
- Don't go!

1349
01:12:05,640 --> 01:12:09,490
[Nervous Jackie telling him not to go...]

1350
01:12:09,800 --> 01:12:10,920
We need three more.

1351
01:12:10,920 --> 01:12:13,430
[Huh? What's Giraffe doing?]

1352
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:16,090
Kwang Soo, we'll stand right here.

1353
01:12:17,430 --> 01:12:20,620
[Planning on infiltrating
the Blue Team's lair!]

1354
01:12:27,130 --> 01:12:29,500
[You little brat...]

1355
01:12:30,660 --> 01:12:33,170
[How dare you!]

1356
01:12:33,390 --> 01:12:36,190
I'll go down!
I'll just go back down!

1357
01:12:36,190 --> 01:12:38,680
[Spectacular punishment.]

1358
01:12:38,680 --> 01:12:40,360
I'll never do it again!

1359
01:12:40,360 --> 01:12:41,980
[Leaving after being properly chastised.]

1360
01:12:43,220 --> 01:12:48,140
[Just then, Ha Ha quietly sneaks up
through the front entrance.]

1361
01:12:51,280 --> 01:12:53,910
[Same punishment for this one!]

1362
01:12:53,910 --> 01:12:56,450
[Battered and bruised.]

1363
01:12:57,890 --> 01:13:00,510
[Giraffe getting another round of beating.]

1364
01:13:01,500 --> 01:13:06,700
[Retreating without accomplishing anything.]

1365
01:13:09,080 --> 01:13:12,000
[The last line of attack is
Big-nosed Brother.]

1366
01:13:14,290 --> 01:13:16,130
[The result is the same...]

1367
01:13:17,310 --> 01:13:18,800
- My glasses.
- Ji Hyo, bring the hat down.

1368
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:21,440
I'll give you your hats back.
Come up here.

1369
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:23,250
[Returning the hats and the glasses
they lost in the battle?]

1370
01:13:23,260 --> 01:13:24,390
Come here.

1371
01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:28,770
[Did you think I'd
give them back to you nicely?]

1372
01:13:31,120 --> 01:13:34,120
[That's the Giraffe's hat...]

1373
01:13:36,220 --> 01:13:39,110
[It's all up to the person
returning the items.]

1374
01:13:40,850 --> 01:13:44,980
[The shocking visuals of the three.]

1375
01:13:45,530 --> 01:13:48,680
[And thus the Green Team started planning
their revenge against the Blue Team.]

1376
01:13:48,680 --> 01:13:53,270
[The defeated Green Team now makes their
move over to the Red Team for their attack.]

1377
01:13:53,270 --> 01:13:55,140
- Jong Kook is there by himself.
- Okay, we can do this.

1378
01:13:55,140 --> 01:13:57,070
If one person grabs his legs,
and the other person grabs his arms.

1379
01:13:57,070 --> 01:13:58,890
<i>If one of us grabs his arms...</i>

1380
01:14:00,550 --> 01:14:01,750
<i>Suk Jin, let's go together.</i>

1381
01:14:01,760 --> 01:14:03,960
[Jong Kook starting to set up defense
after hearing their talk.]

1382
01:14:05,840 --> 01:14:08,750
[Just come and give it a try!]

1383
01:14:10,210 --> 01:14:13,390
[The Red Team's home turf looking
like an iron clad defense line.]

1384
01:14:13,390 --> 01:14:15,280
- Don't even think about this place.
- What is all this?

1385
01:14:15,280 --> 01:14:17,120
Suk Jin, don't even consider
getting through this.

1386
01:14:18,440 --> 01:14:20,870
- The future looks bleak.
- Let's just end this.

1387
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:23,380
[The Red Team makes an offer.]

1388
01:14:23,380 --> 01:14:29,030
[If Red Team is to win, they'll
give the Green Team two darts!]

1389
01:14:29,030 --> 01:14:34,830
[Green Traitors Team perking up
at the offer they're being made.]

1390
01:14:39,500 --> 01:14:41,640
Kwang Soo... let's go.
Let's attack.

1391
01:14:42,140 --> 01:14:44,310
[Extremely gullible Green Team!]

1392
01:14:45,120 --> 01:14:47,990
[Green Team and the Red Team
uniting to attack the Blue Team!]

1393
01:14:47,990 --> 01:14:50,490
[Blue Team in danger!]

1394
01:14:55,420 --> 01:14:58,730
[The united teams coming to attack!]

1395
01:15:00,710 --> 01:15:02,110
Come down, that's right!

1396
01:15:02,120 --> 01:15:04,040
That's good!
Bring her down!

1397
01:15:05,560 --> 01:15:07,940
[Si Won pulls Ace Ji Hyo down
from her spot!]

1398
01:15:14,520 --> 01:15:17,260
[Suk Jin starts looting
the Blue Team's cache!]

1399
01:15:17,990 --> 01:15:19,880
Thieves!

1400
01:15:25,280 --> 01:15:27,260
You have to keep your promise!
Don't forget your promise!

1401
01:15:28,970 --> 01:15:30,740
You really think they're going to
keep their promise?

1402
01:15:32,370 --> 01:15:33,900
You have to keep your promise!

1403
01:15:34,360 --> 01:15:36,720
[What the heck is going on here?]

1404
01:15:37,760 --> 01:15:39,340
<i>Good job!</i>

1405
01:15:43,570 --> 01:15:45,070
Jong Kook!

1406
01:15:45,070 --> 01:15:46,480
- Si Won!
- Jong Kook!

1407
01:15:46,480 --> 01:15:50,100
[Red Team only needs two more masks
to win the game!]

1408
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:56,150
[Preparations to bring down the five masks
he kept in waiting is complete!]

1409
01:15:56,960 --> 01:15:58,320
<i>Hurry up and bring it down!</i>

1410
01:15:58,320 --> 01:16:00,940
<i>- Hurry! Run!
- Bring it down!</i>

1411
01:16:00,940 --> 01:16:08,160
[With Green Team on the lookout...
the other two makes a touchdown!]

1412
01:16:08,160 --> 01:16:09,770
[We're too late.]

1413
01:16:09,770 --> 01:16:11,400
Watch out for Kwang Soo though.

1414
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:13,590
- Okay, I'm going to check.
- Yes.

1415
01:16:13,590 --> 01:16:15,830
I wrapped them all up in a bundle.

1416
01:16:16,970 --> 01:16:18,800
I'm going to check right now.

1417
01:16:22,670 --> 01:16:24,620
[Truly the Giraffe of all betrayals.]

1418
01:16:26,120 --> 01:16:29,080
[How did he think he'd
get away with it?]

1419
01:16:30,080 --> 01:16:33,250
[Just thinking about it himself
seems to bring out a laughter from him.]

1420
01:16:35,090 --> 01:16:39,380
[Stage 4:
Finding the 12 zodiac sign masks...]

1421
01:16:39,380 --> 01:16:42,510
[Red Team wins!]

1422
01:16:43,810 --> 01:16:46,760
[Waiting for the two darts from
the Red Team as they were promised.]

1423
01:16:46,760 --> 01:16:48,570
- We can give it to them, right?
- Give them what?

1424
01:16:48,570 --> 01:16:50,070
- The darts.
- No, you can't.

1425
01:16:50,080 --> 01:16:52,250
But that was the deal we made!

1426
01:16:52,250 --> 01:16:54,460
[They only helped because the Red Team
promised to give them two darts...]

1427
01:16:54,460 --> 01:16:56,100
- See?
- I told you, they couldn't be trusted.

1428
01:16:56,100 --> 01:16:59,000
- We helped the Red Team for the darts.
- We can't give it to them?

1429
01:16:59,010 --> 01:17:01,740
[They just helped another team
without any benefit to themselves.]

1430
01:17:05,840 --> 01:17:11,600
[Final results of the darts,
Red Team- 11: Blue Team- 10: Green Team- 4.]

1431
01:17:16,040 --> 01:17:17,360
Towards the escalators?

1432
01:17:17,950 --> 01:17:21,870
I had a feeling that we weren't going to be
allowed to give them the darts.

1433
01:17:21,870 --> 01:17:24,190
I knew that he'd be
very cut and dry about that.

1434
01:17:25,100 --> 01:17:26,760
I already knew that when I made the offer.

1435
01:17:27,300 --> 01:17:28,740
Come this way, Jackie.

1436
01:17:28,750 --> 01:17:31,310
- He looks tired.
- He said he didn't get any sleep.

1437
01:17:31,310 --> 01:17:33,020
I'm not tired.

1438
01:17:33,510 --> 01:17:35,390
- This is fun.
- You're having fun?

1439
01:17:37,870 --> 01:17:40,590
- We've been funny all day today.
- Yes, we've been very funny.

1440
01:17:41,550 --> 01:17:44,670
[Proposing that they stop being funny,
and get really competitive?]

1441
01:17:45,250 --> 01:17:46,710
- We have to be serious.
- Should we really win?

1442
01:17:46,710 --> 01:17:48,430
- Really? Should we really do this?
- Let's do it.

1443
01:17:48,430 --> 01:17:51,340
- Okay.
- Tr-ai-tors! Cross!

1444
01:17:52,850 --> 01:17:54,570
We're really going to win this.

1445
01:17:54,570 --> 01:17:58,570
[Disbelieving it themselves
as they say the words out loud.]

1446
01:18:00,050 --> 01:18:01,130
Let's do it.

1447
01:18:01,130 --> 01:18:05,060
I remember trying to go to a fan signing
Jackie had when I was little.

1448
01:18:05,500 --> 01:18:07,520
I begged my mom to take me so desperately.

1449
01:18:07,520 --> 01:18:09,810
He was that kind of a hero to me.

1450
01:18:10,290 --> 01:18:14,920
[This place is?]

1451
01:18:14,920 --> 01:18:20,760
[Today's final mission...
throw the golden dart!]

1452
01:18:23,930 --> 01:18:28,040
<i>[Throw the dart and
hit a bulls-eye in the golden zone.]</i>

1453
01:18:28,520 --> 01:18:30,550
Is that middle area the golden zone?

1454
01:18:30,980 --> 01:18:33,700
[The team to hit the bulls-eye in this
zone first is the ultimate winner!]

1455
01:18:33,700 --> 01:18:36,860
<i>This is the final treasure hunter mission.</i>

1456
01:18:36,870 --> 01:18:41,600
[To be fair, practicing is not allowed!]

1457
01:18:41,600 --> 01:18:43,490
Practice shots...

1458
01:18:43,490 --> 01:18:45,090
Ah, no practice!

1459
01:18:46,260 --> 01:18:47,270
No practice.

1460
01:18:47,270 --> 01:18:51,180
[Jackie throws one before the translator
could even tell him there's no practice.]

1461
01:18:52,270 --> 01:18:54,140
- But it's Jackie.
- It's Jackie.

1462
01:18:56,060 --> 01:18:57,310
Okay, let's go.

1463
01:18:57,320 --> 01:18:59,250
Don't go easy on anyone.
You have to be serious.

1464
01:18:59,260 --> 01:19:00,700
If I land it in there, it's over, right?

1465
01:19:00,700 --> 01:19:02,250
- Yes.
- First person to hit it wins?

1466
01:19:02,250 --> 01:19:04,240
- How many does the Red Team have?
- They have 11.

1467
01:19:04,250 --> 01:19:05,720
So they have one more than us.

1468
01:19:06,170 --> 01:19:10,080
[Si Won to throw the first dart.]

1469
01:19:11,170 --> 01:19:16,130
[I will win by landing it in my first try!]

1470
01:19:24,970 --> 01:19:29,160
[If he lands it in the golden zone, he wins!
Will he land it in the zone?]

1471
01:19:33,260 --> 01:19:35,160
<i>It's okay, you did good.</i>

1472
01:19:35,160 --> 01:19:36,610
[It seems he threw it a bit too hard.]

1473
01:19:37,420 --> 01:19:40,340
[Blue Team's Ace Ji Hyo takes a turn!]

1474
01:19:42,650 --> 01:19:45,640
No way... I think you may do it.
I have a feeling you may get it.

1475
01:19:48,250 --> 01:19:49,810
That's a really high score area.

1476
01:19:49,810 --> 01:19:52,140
[Big-nosed Brother
from the Green Team's turn!]

1477
01:19:52,140 --> 01:19:57,090
Impala, Impala!
Impala is still alive!

1478
01:20:00,780 --> 01:20:03,440
He used to go to dart bars
quite frequently back in his day.

1479
01:20:03,860 --> 01:20:07,650
He used to get yelled at all the time
by his wife for not coming home.

1480
01:20:07,810 --> 01:20:09,570
Don't listen to him, don't listen to him.

1481
01:20:10,730 --> 01:20:16,350
[I'll show you...
my dart throwing skills!]

1482
01:20:16,510 --> 01:20:18,200
That looks good.

1483
01:20:24,520 --> 01:20:26,300
[That must've been a very
long time ago...]

1484
01:20:27,400 --> 01:20:30,510
[Gary of the Red Team's turn!]

1485
01:20:30,510 --> 01:20:33,350
[Too much thinking isn't good!]

1486
01:20:33,350 --> 01:20:34,790
- This is all about luck and fate.
- That's right.

1487
01:20:40,300 --> 01:20:44,190
[It's not good to think
too little about it either...]

1488
01:20:44,190 --> 01:20:45,630
You should've thought about it
a little more.

1489
01:20:45,850 --> 01:20:50,040
[Jackie of the Blue Team's turn!]

1490
01:20:51,570 --> 01:20:56,100
[World action star, Jackie Chan!
Will he land it in the golden zone?]

1491
01:21:05,010 --> 01:21:08,210
[So close! But still much
closer to the golden zone!]

1492
01:21:08,650 --> 01:21:11,370
[Ha Ha of the Green Team's turn!]

1493
01:21:12,380 --> 01:21:13,820
Energy...

1494
01:21:15,550 --> 01:21:17,200
[Here, take it.]

1495
01:21:17,670 --> 01:21:20,550
[Ha Ha with Jackie's energy, will he?]

1496
01:21:26,860 --> 01:21:28,800
You should've thrown it softer.

1497
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:32,780
[Mr. Capable of the Red Team!]

1498
01:21:32,780 --> 01:21:34,380
How many darts do they have each?

1499
01:21:37,650 --> 01:21:40,490
He's not good, he's not good.
Jong Kook is bad at throwing things.

1500
01:21:40,490 --> 01:21:41,820
[Weak skills when it comes to throwing things.]

1501
01:21:41,820 --> 01:21:43,240
- Jong Kook, you're not very good.
- It's okay.

1502
01:21:43,240 --> 01:21:46,720
[Blue Team's Jackie takes another turn!]

1503
01:21:54,360 --> 01:21:57,950

It may happen for sure next time!]

1504
01:21:58,780 --> 01:22:03,560
[With the few darts they have,
this is Kwang Soo's first and last turn.]

1505
01:22:03,560 --> 01:22:04,880
His first and last chance!

1506
01:22:04,880 --> 01:22:06,710
- Jae Suk...
- What? It's the truth.

1507
01:22:06,710 --> 01:22:09,280
Tr-ai-tors Cross!

1508
01:22:19,630 --> 01:22:22,360
[I like this guy...]

1509
01:22:22,360 --> 01:22:24,540
We have to keep making people laugh
since we're the funny team.

1510
01:22:24,540 --> 01:22:26,480
We're the comedic relief today.

1511
01:22:27,710 --> 01:22:30,520
[Red Team's Si Won takes
another chance!]

1512
01:22:31,870 --> 01:22:35,320
[Much more stable stance than earlier!]

1513
01:22:43,970 --> 01:22:45,270
- It's over!
- Is it over?

1514
01:22:46,730 --> 01:22:49,590
[Wow! A bulls-eye in the golden zone!]

1515
01:22:49,590 --> 01:22:51,940
[My goodness...]

1516
01:22:52,720 --> 01:22:55,530
[It really is a bulls-eye in the golden zone!]

1517
01:22:55,530 --> 01:22:57,240
[You're the best, Si Won.]

1518
01:22:57,250 --> 01:23:01,050
For the win today...
Si Won landed the dart in the golden zone.

1519
01:23:01,050 --> 01:23:02,910
Red Team is the winner of the day!

1520
01:23:02,920 --> 01:23:05,310

The Red Team!]

[This is today's treasure: The golden boot.]

1522
01:23:14,870 --> 01:23:16,790
- Great job.
- Thank you.

1523
01:23:16,790 --> 01:23:21,070
More than anything today,
all day since early this morning...

1524
01:23:21,070 --> 01:23:24,060
Jackie, who's been with us today.
He really is like a brother to all of us.

1525
01:23:24,060 --> 01:23:28,390
[The big brother from Hong Kong, Jackie!]

1526
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:35,480
[Jackie Chan is still alive!]

1527
01:23:37,080 --> 01:23:40,120
Seriously... I absolutely love Jackie!

1528
01:23:40,120 --> 01:23:42,560
[Still unable to believe that he's
been by their side all day for the show.]

1529
01:23:42,560 --> 01:23:46,360
Can you please say a word
to all our viewers out there?

1530
01:23:48,400 --> 01:23:50,130
I love you!

1531

- This is our gift to you to keep as memory.
- Really?

1532

Wow, thank you!

1533
01:24:02,750 --> 01:24:05,750
[The Red Team even happier to see him
accepting it with such a happy heart.]

1534
01:24:05,750 --> 01:24:08,010
These are the words he said...
Thank you so much.

1535
01:24:08,010 --> 01:24:11,130
[Jackie likes gold too?]

1536
01:24:11,130 --> 01:24:13,540
Ultimately... we're all the same!

1537
01:24:13,540 --> 01:24:15,250
- We're all the same!
- We are all the same!

1538
01:24:16,400 --> 01:24:17,540
All the same!
