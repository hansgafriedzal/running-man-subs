[Rage virus...]

62

It's not that I'm afraid.

63
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:06,820
There are just three things in
this world that I'm scared of.

64

Bugs...

65
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,030

The Earth devoid of laughter...

75
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:39,540
I will save it from its despair.

76

I will... find the laughter that's been lost
and return it back to humanity!

77

<i>Rage virus?</i>

78
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:51,320
I think this may be for real.
I think it really must be the rage virus.

I keep feeling surges of anger!

83
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:07,490
In a world that's already lacking in love,
and consideration for one another...

84
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:10,650
if we keep breaking each other down,
and hurting each other...

85
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:14,010
this isn't the world I want to live in.

86
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:19,540
[A world that's been filled with rage...]

87
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:28,230

infected by the rage virus</i>

00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:48,550
What the heck is he talking about?

95
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:51,010
Myuk PD is the one who's about to
make me break out into a fit of rage.

- We have to get out?
- Everyone, move out!

101
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,960
This area is full of the rage virus strain!

102
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:14,010
[Doing whatever they can not to
get infected by the rage virus.]

103
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:15,590
- Move!
- Why?

104
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:18,320
[Thus, they escape into the safety
of the green zone area.]

105
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:19,970
What is this?

106
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:23,350
This is the green zone. The only
area left where you can still laugh.

107
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:27,750
- We can laugh now?
- I'm going to laugh as much as I want now!

108
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:36,910
<i>You will now be tested to see how well you
can handle an emergency situation.</i>

109
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:40,510
<i>Since the rage virus strain has already
spread over this rest area...</i>

110
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:42,410
- Really?
- Is that why no one is laughing?

111
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:47,900
<i>If you get through the virus to buy food
from the gas station to bring back here</i>

112
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:53,410
<i>I will use the items of food you bring back
to judge if you're fit to become an agent.</i>

113
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:57,470

116
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:12,770
<i>Inhale the happy helium gas, and bring back
the food you're assigned from the station.</i>

117
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,260
<i>But if your voice doesn't emit the sound
of the happy helium gas when you return</i>

118
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:16,280
<i>then you fail the mission.</i>

119
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,280
- We have to do it very quickly then.
- Helium gas never really works for me.

120
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:25,390
- This is simple.
- That's way too easy.

121
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:27,540
- I have water.
- What is this?

122
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:29,470
- I have dried squid.
- I have to bring back miso soup?

123
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:31,100

[Rule: Must inhale the happy helium gas from
the green zone first before starting.]

127
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,480
You want us to inhale it now?

128
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:44,370
We're supposed to inhale this, right?

129
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:46,780
So this is what your voice sounds like
when you inhale the gas.

130
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:48,600
[The ability to make anyone happy is
the power of happy helium gas.]

131
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,590
Hurry, hurry!
Let's all hurry!

132
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:56,670
I'm full, I'm full.
Wait, I think I inhaled way too much.

133
00:06:56,670 --> 00:06:59,080
[Overindulging in the happy helium gas.]

134

00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:19,690
[Must hold their breath for as long as
possible to retain the helium gas.]

139
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,120

00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,810
[Darn...]

141
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:26,070

Clam miso soup.

146
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:42,920
6,000 won?

147
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:44,650
[Infected with the rage virus?
A very stoic expression.]

148

[Agent Ro-Ro and Agent Gary on their
quest to buy ham toast and dried squid.]

149

Do you have sweet potato sticks?

153
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:00,970
How is the voice going to last all this way
after inhaling it just once?

154
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:02,840
I'm starting to feel the rage.

155
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,560
Toast.

156
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:07,420
- It's 1,500 won.
- Here.

157
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:15,580
- Did your voice last all the way there?
- This is ham toast.

158
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:19,660
[Voice tampering - Fail.]

159
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:21,020
Why?

160
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:22,290
Thank you.

161
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:24,850
- How are we supposed to...
- This is how you do it, Suk Jin.

162
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:27,240
You just keep visiting the
recharge stations like this one.

163
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,670
You have to go get the food first
before you can charge back up.

[Agent Jae Suk making his way
with abated breath.]

[Ddok kalbi Bibimbap is finally ready.]

169
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,960
Thank you.

170
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:56,400
[Heading back to the green zone
with abated breath!]

171
00:08:57,770 --> 00:08:59,520
I don't think I have what it takes
to become an agent.

172
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:01,620
This isn't going to work.

173
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,580
[Did Blank Ji make it?]

174
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:06,540
- She's won't make it.
- No. She took a big breath.

175
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:10,230
Ddok kalbi bibimbap.

176
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:13,760
I brought the water.

177
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:16,510
I said, I got the water.

178
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:18,570
[Obviously faking the voice.]

179
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:21,100
Suk Jin... that's
Detective Colombo's voice.

180
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:22,920
But I brought the water.

181
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,930
This is impossible!

182
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:29,690
[Returning at an unbelievable speed.]

183
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:33,120
- Dried squid!
- He didn't make it.

184
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,190
I got it!

185
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:36,130
- Dried squid. I got it!
- He didn't make it.

186
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:40,040
Seafood tofu soup.

187
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:43,540
[Will the Giraffe pull it off?]

188
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:49,220
- You have to tell him.
- We have to verify.

189
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:50,590
Seafood tofu soup.

190
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:52,870
[Fail]

191
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:54,440
My voice wasn't like that a second ago.

192
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,370
This is absolutely impossible.

193
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:03,800
[With his breath held tight...]

194
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:05,760
Seafood tofu soup.

195
00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:09,580
<i>You're disqualified.</i>

196
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:13,270
Are you able to do this, Jong Kook?

197
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:16,010
It's impossible for me.

198
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:20,080
[Tiger with his mouth sealed shut
to prevent himself from breathing.]

199
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:25,530
[Tiger not even budging at the teasing.]

200
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:26,660
Ma'am...

201
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,270
Please cancel the clam miso soup.

202
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,010
[It's already done...]

203
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:37,240
Seafood tofu soup.
An order of seafood tofu soup.

204
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,310
An order of the
seafood tofu soup, please.

205
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:44,010
[Mute Agent Tiger receives his order.]

206
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:46,660
You're still not going to say anything?

207
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:49,580
[Looks as though he plans on remaining
silent until he reaches the green zone.]

208
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:57,540
[Even through the cheers
from nearby fans...]

209
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:00,480
[Just remain focus on task at hand
while greeting them with his eyes.]

210
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:07,330
[Did Agent Kkuk pull it off?]

211
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:11,150
Clam miso soup.

212
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:12,870
[Wow!]

213
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:15,930
[Success]

214
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,890
[Agent Kkuk is the first to pass the test!]

215
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:21,010
- How did you do it?
- How do you do it?

216
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:24,090
<i>Agent Kim can proceed with his meal
now that he's passed his test.</i>

217
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,290
Yes, I understand.

218
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:29,340
<i>I will change out your food for something
that is a bit closer in distance.</i>

219
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:32,630
[Exchanging out the food for the agents
left behind with their weak lungs.]

220
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:34,380
- What is this?
- Walnut cookie!

221
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:38,280
Fire grilled burger.

222
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,950
You can't breathe at all?

223
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:41,200
Let's just not breathe at all.

224
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:44,040
A chicken skewer!

225
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:48,110
[Blank Ji with her breath held is
on a mission to find her grilled burger.]

226
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:50,240
- Here you go.
- How much is it?

227
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,700
An order of popcorn, please.

228
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:53,690
Popcorn, please.

229
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:57,460
[Taking the opportunity to recharge
themselves after having bought their food.]

230
00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:00,710
[Back to the green zone!]

231
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:04,190
You're done for, Kwang Soo.
You didn't pull it off.

232
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:05,790
Squid on the stick.

233
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:11,340
[The happy helium gas not very
compatible with the Giraffe.]

234
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:12,740
- So funny
- Squid on the stick.

235
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:20,550
[Did Blank Ji do it?]

236
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:25,210
Fire grilled burger!

237
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:28,010
[Success]

238
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:31,630
- I thought I was going to die!
- Come on, Ji Hyo!

239
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:34,120
[As always, Mr. Capable and Ace
are the first two to get the job done?]

240
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:35,830
- Did you run back here?
- I ran back as fast as I could.

241
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:38,340
- You are now in the second place.
- Here comes Suk Jin.

242
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:40,710
[Impala finally makes his way back.]

243
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:43,000
Here's your popcorn.

244
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,300
- Here's your popcorn.
- Wow!

245
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,590
[Success]

246
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:50,830
<i>You are now in third place.
You may go take your seat.</i>

247
00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:55,410
[The ease of having succeeded
their mission already.]

248
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:59,440
[Only three of the four left remaining
will get to become agents.]

249
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,340
Sweet potato sticks.

250
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:08,360
[Success]

251
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:12,030
[This won't do!]

252
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:15,380
Where are you going?
Gary, where are you going?

253
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:20,070
[The happy gas is effective in
making them extremely happy.]

254
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:27,820
[With his breath held...]

255
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:33,150
Sausage on a stick.

256
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:35,880
[Success]

257
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:37,730
I guess it is possible.

258
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:45,090
<i>- Kwang Soo...
- Yes?</i>

259
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:46,600
- Chicken skewer.
- He did it.

260
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,530
[Success]

261
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:52,480
- You passed.
- Chicken skewer!

262
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:56,050
[Gary is the sixth one to succeed.
Then that means...]

263
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:59,650
Mr. Lee Kwang Soo, who didn't pass
the agent endurance test...

264
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:02,300
You weren't able to make it back
to the safety of the green zone

265
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,540
and therefore have been infected
by the rage virus.

266
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:10,230
[Infected by the rage virus!]

267
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:13,210
- Then Kwang Soo can't come with us?
- Don't come!

268
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:14,780
Already?

269
00:14:15,530 --> 00:14:16,770
<i>Now that you are an infected carrier...</i>

270
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:18,840
What do you mean, infected carrier?
Why are you treating me like a disease?

271
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:22,420
Why am I already going to jail?
I'm ousted already?

272
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:24,820
[Oh no... showing signs of
the rage virus already...]

273
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:27,500
[Lee Kwang Soo a.k.a. Giraffe,
Infected by the rage virus.]

274
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:32,100
<i>The rest of you fortunately passed
your agent test</i>

275
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:34,220
<i>and were able to make it back to
the safety of the green zone.</i>

276
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:35,380
[Luckily survives in the green zone.]

277
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:37,510
- Tr...
- There's no 'Ai'.

278
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:38,620
Ai!

279
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:41,630
[Where is rage virus infected
Kwang Soo being taken off to?]

280
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:49,330
[Kwang Soo is no longer able to smile
now that he's been infected by the virus.]

281
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,350
I'm getting so angry!

282
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:53,140
I can't control this rage!

283
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:55,930
[The Giraffe is already full of rage.]

284
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:02,060
<i>Where are you taking me?
Wait!</i>

285
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:06,830
[Where is the rage virus infected
Giraffe being taken to?]

286

you become one of the infected.</i>

287

<i>The rest of you will now head off to
your next mission location.</i>

288
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:18,290
<i>Just like when you got
out of your car</i>

289
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:21,320
<i>you have to hold your breath on your way
back to your car until you're safely inside.</i>

290
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:25,090
- Are you going to keep doing this to us?
- How can you say that with a straight face?

291
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:32,100
<i>You guys are humanity's last hope
of finding back the lost laughter.</i>

292
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:34,970
We have to do whatever we can to
bring the laughter back to humanity.

293
00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:36,420
I will save the future of humanity.

294
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:39,690
- But why are blue ropes in the green zone?
- Just hurry up and leave.

295
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:42,610
- The ropes aren't green though.
- What does that matter?

296
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,650
His face is starting to look
more and more like a robot.

297

[Moments later]

298
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:55,410
Find the last remaining vial of the
laughter vaccine which is being kept at...

Find the last vial of the vaccine,
and save all of humanity.

300
00:15:57,650 --> 00:15:59,230
There's only one?

301

[Laughter vaccine?]

[The last remaining vial of laughter vaccine

[Will they be able to stop the rage virus
from its path of destruction?]

storage room somewhere within this facility.</i>

00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,600
[Big-nose is also discovered by
the security agents.]

337
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:40,100
[In order to get their hands on the ID card,
they must avoid being sighted by the agents!]

338
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:50,770
<i>- Intruder!
- Intruder!</i>

339
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:55,900
[Humanity's last hopes are too busy being
chased around by the security agents.]

340
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,610
What?

341
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:01,660
I think we have to rip the name tags
off of the scientists' back.

342
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:04,720
- Their name tags?
- It's just a feeling that I have.

343
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,640
The reason being,
they all have a name tag on their backs.

344
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,980
I see what you're saying.
Instead of just taking it from them?

345
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:10,800
Get over here.
You keep exposing our location.

346
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:14,340
- So instead of just taking their ID cards...
- That's what I think.

347
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:17,420
And once we rip off the name tag,
with all these scientists around...

348
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:20,570
that's how I think we figure out which
of the scientists has the ID cards for us.

349
00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:23,180
- That's just my guess, anyway.
- I think you're right.

350
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:25,490
There would be no other reason for the
scientists to have name tags on their backs.

351
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:29,960
- That's exactly what I was thinking too.
- What a joke!

352
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:34,380
Hey... our earth has lost all
its ability to laugh right now.

353
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:36,380
If I could crack a joke and
make someone laugh, that's great.

354
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:38,570
You just stole the words
right out of my mouth.

355
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:41,240
- Thanks for relaying my thoughts for me.
- You really are so shameless.

356
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,690
- What do you mean, shameless?
- How did you get to become so shameless?

357
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:45,340
I just said that you stole the
words right out of my mouth.

358
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:47,000
I was going to rip the name tag off of
one of their backs earlier.

359
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,910
No, you can't go through there now.
Come over here.

360
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:50,100
I said, come here!

361
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:56,130
[Now that they take a look...]

362
00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:00,610
[All the scientists with the ID cards...]

363
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:03,520
[Have a name tag on their backs.]

364
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:17,240
Ha Ha! What is this?
What's going on here?

365
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,240
- What are you...
- You startled me!

366
00:20:21,130 --> 00:20:22,490
- Did you rip off any name tags?
- What?

367
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:24,100
- I asked if you ripped off any name tags?
- I have to rip off their name tags?

368
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:26,090
We can get the ID's
if we rip off their name tags.

369
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:28,000
- Really?
- Rip off their name tags.

370
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,090
[Agent Ha Ha also thinks that ripping off
the scientists' name tags is the key.]

371
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:37,520
[Mr. Capable targeting
the scientists' name tags.]

372
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,360
<i>Intruder!
Intruder alert!</i>

373
00:20:52,610 --> 00:20:55,220
[Surprise attack on the scientists!]

374
00:20:57,650 --> 00:21:01,150
[Bingo! The scientist faints as soon as
the name tag is ripped off!]

375
00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:05,230
[Agent Ha Ha gets his hand
on the scientist's ID badge!]

376
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:08,800
I should've asked you this
while you were still conscious.

377
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,930
But where's the science lab?

378
00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:13,390
Huh?
Where is the vaccine being kept?

379
00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:14,860
Can you hear me?
Please answer me.

380
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:16,170
Hey!

381
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:26,450
[Agent Jae Suk is also on the hunt
to get his hands on the ID badge.]

382
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:27,610
Here are some scientists.

383
00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:29,700
- Scientist!
- Intruder alert!

384
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:32,830
I need your ID badge.

385
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,410
Thanks.

386
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,990
[Mr. Capable springs an ambush attack.]

387
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:48,940
[Mr. Capable immediately escapes after
getting his hands on the ID badge!]

388
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,650
Now I have to find where the
vaccine is being kept.

389
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,570
- Suk Jin!
- Ji Hyo...

390
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,870
I'm going to go crazy with
all these people chasing after me.

391
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:13,240
Where did Ha Ha go?
He was with me just until a moment ago.

392
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,490
What's over here?

393
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:17,800
I don't know what that is.

394
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,690
- I haven't been in there.
- Hey! Hey!

395
00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:21,450
- What is it?
- It's the vaccine storage room.

396
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:27,170
[Vaccine storage room is discovered!]

397
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:28,330
Don't you think?

398
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:31,510
[Verification pad for the ID's.]

399
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:33,390
Have you seen this?
It's the vaccine storage room.

400
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:37,020
[All the members gathering around at the
news of the vaccine room being discovered.]

401
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:39,190
- Did you see this vaccine storage room?
- Is this it?

402
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:41,200
- You're right!
- This is the room.

403
00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:43,640
Where is it?

404
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:47,830
- So if we bring the ID badges...
- You can get through if you have the ID.

405
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:49,150
I think you're right.

406
00:22:54,650 --> 00:22:57,260
[You think someone will open the door
if you knock on it?]

407
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:03,950
[Everyone eyeing each other down
even though they all have their own ID's.]

408
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,420
I was just looking at
the vaccine storage room.

409
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:09,520
[Haroro waiting for everyone to
leave from his hiding spot.]

410
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:12,060
You're not just a fox,
but the sneakiest of all foxes.

411
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:13,790
- No, I'm not!
- What do you mean, you're not?

412
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:15,070
- No, I'm not!
- Yes, you are.

413
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:18,530
You seriously think that blank expression
is going to work on me right now?

414
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:19,590
[Are they all gone?]

415
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:33,510
[There's no one around, right?]

416
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:46,180
[Just then, Jae Suk heads towards the
vaccine storage room with an ID of his own.]

417
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:48,480
[Wait... Jae Suk is...]

418
00:23:57,540 --> 00:23:59,370
Wow, Suk Jin...

419
00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:07,380
- I have one too!
- No, I have one!

420
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:11,590
[The emergency alarm starts going off!]

421
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:15,230
[After they all pretended not to
have an ID on them...]

422
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:19,740
[It seems as though they're not able to open
the door with the ID's they currently have.]

423
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:21,270
- How many ID's did we try?
- You all had one?

424
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:23,630
Pretending not to have one
when you did...

425
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:26,290
[The trickery Running Man members
are known for.]

426
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:30,380
[The emergency alarm sounds again!]

427
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:32,300
<i>Intruder!
Intruder alert!</i>

428
00:24:33,790 --> 00:24:37,050
[With the alarm going off again,
the security guards rush in!]

429
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:40,140
Over there!
He went that way!

430
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:47,140
[Ultimately gets captured
by the security guards.]

431
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:48,860
Seriously, come on!

432
00:24:56,290 --> 00:24:58,990
Aren't you supposed to give me your ID?
Give it to me. Hurry up and give it to me.

433
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:01,000
Come on.

434
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,390
- Give it to me quickly!
- Catch the intruder!

435
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,110
Let go of me!

436
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:15,120
[Just as he finally gets his hand on one...]

437
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,350
- Do I have to give this back?
- This is just too funny!

438
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:19,010
They're going to take this back?

439
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:21,140
This is mine.

440
00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:28,190
[Forced outside of the building once
captured by the security agents.]

441
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:32,720
Gary...

442
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:37,680
[Members getting kicked out one by one.]

443
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:39,340
Why didn't they give me the badge right
away when I ripped off their name tag?

444
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:41,670
Huh?
You have to take it from them.

445
00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:42,860
I have to take it from them?

446
00:25:43,530 --> 00:25:46,090
How many people are they
going to kick out?

447
00:25:46,090 --> 00:25:48,230
Kang Gary, you were hilarious.

448
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:50,290
All I could see was your face.

449
00:25:51,770 --> 00:25:54,640
<i>I can't believe they didn't
burst out laughing.</i>

450
00:25:58,970 --> 00:26:01,070
[No matter, they have now realized that the
ID pass to the storage room is elsewhere.]

451
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:04,890
If you scan a fake badge, it sounds the alarm
and those security agents' runs over.

452
00:26:04,890 --> 00:26:06,870
- You think?
- And the real one will open the door.

453
00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:09,690
What I think is...

454
00:26:09,690 --> 00:26:12,020
I bet we have a guest today,
and the guest is hiding in there.

455
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:15,010
[Their imaginations are running amok.]

456
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:20,610
[The four members are looking for an open
entryway after having been kicked out.]

457
00:26:20,610 --> 00:26:26,260
[Will they be able to save humanity
by the end of the day?]

458
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:28,960
[On the other hand...]

459
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:32,920
[Having escaped the situation earlier,
Haroro heads towards the storage room again.]

460
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:37,530
[Wait...]

461
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:41,340
The color is different.
Look, the color itself is different.

462
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:45,340
All the rest have a silver sticker on it,
but this one has a gold sticker on it.

463
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:47,480
[After a closer look, only one
has the gold 'R' sticker on it!]

464
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:58,300
[The door is opening!]

465
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:03,340
State the password.

466
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:07,500
[There's another door that needs
a secret password to get through?]

467
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:10,480
The one who controls time!

468
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:14,280
[Incorrect password]

469
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:18,850
Haroro is the best!
I want you to be the love of my life.

470
00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:22,500
<i>Intruder!
Intruder alert!</i>

471
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:29,890
[The security devices sound off!
The security agents rush in again.]

472
00:27:29,890 --> 00:27:32,200
Intruder!
Intruder!

473
00:27:38,930 --> 00:27:41,900
[Haroro barely escapes their clutches.]

474
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:52,010
[The security pass for the first
entrance gate is now in his hands.]

475
00:27:53,690 --> 00:27:55,540
I have to find the passcode now.

476
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:57,120
The passcode.

477
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:03,710
[The security code for the second doorway
is hidden somewhere in here...]

478
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:09,290
Intruder!

479
00:28:09,290 --> 00:28:11,750
Yeah... I'm the intruder!

480
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:16,940
How are we going to find
the vaccine at this rate?

481
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:23,460
[Will they really be able to find
the vaccine at this rate?]

482
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:27,300
<i>Let's go!</i>

483
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:34,040
[Rage virus carrier Kwang Soo
being transferred to the facility.]

484
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:36,950
Let go!

485
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:38,530
Let me go!

486
00:28:39,670 --> 00:28:43,190
[The effects of the virus?
Inexplicable fits of rage.]

487
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:45,870
You've been seriously infected.

488
00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:48,350
Infected?
Infected, my butt!

489
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:52,860
Restrain him.

490
00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:13,300
[Rage virus infection rate testing.]

491
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:18,750
[First phase - Dog weed tickle test.]

492
00:29:19,370 --> 00:29:25,830
[As guessed, no fits of laughter.
Showing signs of rage.]

493

[Third phase - Testing the response to having
the bottom of his foot tickled with a feather.]

498
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:52,640
[Laughter? Rage?]

499
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:56,640
So angry!
I'm so angry!

500
00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:00,540
[On the brink of insanity from all the rage!]

501
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:02,390
<i>I'm so angry I could die!</i>

502
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:15,980
[Starting to get fed up from
being chased nonstop.]

503
00:30:21,890 --> 00:30:23,070
Hey!

504
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:25,770
Did you find anything?

505
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:31,320
[Why does he look so busy?]

506
00:30:32,910 --> 00:30:34,560
I don't think I can keep doing this.

507
00:30:42,630 --> 00:30:46,370
[Is that you hiding?]

508
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:49,860
Three... four... five.

509
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:53,270
[Gary finding and gathering up as many
ID badges as he could get his hands on.]

510
00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:56,410
If it's not one of these,
I'm going to give up on saving humanity.

511
00:30:57,330 --> 00:30:58,540
Please!

512
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:06,410
[Rushing to test out his second badge
before the security agents rushes in.]

513
00:31:07,430 --> 00:31:08,470
The door's opening!

514
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:11,320
[It opened!]

515
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:12,730
It opened!

516
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,260
State the passcode.

517
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:16,640
What's the passcode?

518
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:18,480
Running Man!

519
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,900
[Incorrect passcode]

520
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:23,950
Laughter brings good luck.

521
00:31:25,470 --> 00:31:26,520
What is this?

522
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,700
Roll-Roll!

523
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:33,870
Where am I supposed to
get the passcode?

524
00:31:33,870 --> 00:31:35,400
That's really cold.

525
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,470
<i>Intruder!
Intruder!</i>

526
00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:40,680
<i>Intruder!
Intruder!</i>

527
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,320
I want to participate in the race.

528
00:31:47,170 --> 00:31:49,090
I want to participate in the race!

529
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:51,490
I want to film the episode!

530
00:31:51,950 --> 00:31:54,150
I want my face to be on TV!

531
00:31:57,260 --> 00:32:00,730
[The more the infection sets in,
the more violent Giraffe becomes.]

532
00:32:05,470 --> 00:32:12,210
<i>Intruder Kim Jong Kook is now infected.
Quarantine measures to be taken.</i>

533
00:32:13,650 --> 00:32:14,940
What did he just say?

534
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:20,860
What does this mean?

535
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:23,390
What does this mean?

536
00:32:24,570 --> 00:32:26,580
What does this mean?

537
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:29,020
What does...

538
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:38,330
[What is this sudden...]

539
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:46,610
<i>Intruder Kim Jong Kook is now infected.
Quarantine measures to be taken.</i>

540
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:50,110
[He's been... infected?]

541
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:55,330
[Mr. Capable...]

542
00:32:55,330 --> 00:32:59,600
[is now infected by the rage virus!]

543
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:03,410
[Intruder Kim Jong Kook is now infected.
Quarantine measures to be taken.]

544
00:33:04,050 --> 00:33:05,650
- Gary.
- Hey!

545
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:07,740
- It's a water gun.
- What?

546
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:09,440
- It's a water gun.
- Where's the water gun?

547
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:12,200
[Water gun?]

548
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:17,470
[Ha Ha calls everyone over to him.]

549
00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:19,060
- Jong Kook.
- What?

550
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:21,230
- Jong Kook.
- What about Jong Kook?

551
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:22,570
- What about Jong Kook?
- His back.

552
00:33:22,570 --> 00:33:26,120
Something just got shot on his back.

553
00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:27,620
- Really?
- Jong Kook?

554
00:33:27,850 --> 00:33:31,680
[His back's been shot by something?]

555
00:33:36,650 --> 00:33:43,060
[Evidence of water gun shooting
on Mr. Capable's name tag!]

556
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:46,060
He's been shot by something on his back.

557
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:47,530
- Really?
- Jong Kook did?

558
00:33:47,530 --> 00:33:48,590
Hang on.

559
00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:52,370
[The agents starting to become
suspicious of one another.]

560
00:33:53,890 --> 00:33:55,160
I don't have anything.

561
00:33:56,030 --> 00:33:57,540
Be careful.
Everyone needs to be careful.

562
00:33:57,540 --> 00:34:00,420
- Everyone scatter about for now.
- What is it? Tell me what you know.

563
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:01,560
- Did you see it happen?
- No, I didn't see anything.

564
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:03,610
- Where did you see Jong Kook?
- I got a glimpse of his back.

565
00:34:03,610 --> 00:34:05,370
Now that Jong Kook's been infected,
we're finished.

566
00:34:05,370 --> 00:34:08,430
- Where did Jong Kook go?
- I think he's been taken off to jail.

567
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:13,890
[But...]

568
00:34:13,890 --> 00:34:24,020
[This was just the beginning of
a bigger conspiracy.]

569
00:34:25,470 --> 00:34:26,710
Ha Ha...

570
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:29,410
But how did you see the water gun?

571
00:34:29,410 --> 00:34:32,560
I didn't see the water gun, but saw
the mark of it on Jong Kook's back.

572
00:34:32,970 --> 00:34:34,590
You saw it on Jong Kook's back?

573
00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:37,530
I saw some sort of watermark on
Jong Kook's name tag on his back.

574
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:41,120
[Watermark?]

575
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:43,150
Yoo-ames Bond?

576
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:45,960
Yoo-ames Bond.

577
00:34:49,850 --> 00:34:52,610
[When it comes to water guns...]

578
00:34:52,610 --> 00:34:56,520
[Yoo-ames Bond...]

579
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:05,220
[Yoo-ames Bond secretly ousted everyone
with his water gun a year ago.]

580
00:35:06,210 --> 00:35:09,640
I didn't want to say this because I didn't
want any suspicions cast my way, but...

581
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:11,560
I won't suspect you.
Tell me what it is.

582
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:15,680
But it's Mid-April.

583
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:22,050
[Around the same time last year was
part two of Yoo-ames Bond story.]

584
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:24,260
Part two we had last year...

585
00:35:25,370 --> 00:35:28,500
I recently watched that episode again
so that I don't get tricked again this year.

586
00:35:29,290 --> 00:35:31,250
You really are one frightening woman.

587
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:33,020
You watched that again so that
you don't fall for it?

588
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:35,730
I watched it thinking that it's possible
for that to happen again.

589
00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:38,760
But that was some time in Mid-April.

590
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:41,440
I don't remember the exact date,
but it was in April.

591
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:45,190
Remember how cold it was at night?

592
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:51,550
Let's just keep this in mind,
and get on our way.

593
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:56,210
[Could Yoo-ames Bond be the culprit?]

594
00:36:04,410 --> 00:36:06,340
[Unauthorized ID pass.]

595
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:07,870
This one isn't it either.

596
00:36:11,810 --> 00:36:13,690
I don't even have the energy
to run around anymore.

597
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:22,200
Why did Jong Kook get ousted?

598
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,820
I don't know, Jae Suk.

599
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:29,440
[Face to face... with Agent Blank.]

600
00:36:31,490 --> 00:36:32,940
Jong Kook...

601
00:36:34,010 --> 00:36:35,340
I wonder why he got ousted?

602
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,630
I heard he was shot with a water gun.

603
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,740
- Water gun?
- He was shot by a water gun.

604
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,520
Who told you that?

605
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:44,860
Who told you that?

606
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,710
- Ji Hyo, it's not me.
- Wait, Yoo-ames Bond, wait.

607
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:56,910
- Is it time for part three?
- Ji Hyo...

608
00:36:57,310 --> 00:36:59,360
- Wait! Don't come any closer!
- Okay, I'm not getting closer.

609
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:01,970
It's not me.
This is entrapment.

610
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:06,450
[Jae Suk vehemently denying that
he is the culprit.]

611
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:09,520
- How do I know you're not?
- It's not me!

612
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:13,510
- Ji Hyo! It's not me!
- There's a water gun being played.

613
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:14,640
I'm about to lose my mind.

614
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,710
- Ji Hyo, it's not that!
- There's a water gun!

615
00:37:17,450 --> 00:37:20,350
- Ji Hyo...
- In the past three years of this show...

616
00:37:20,350 --> 00:37:23,790
Water gun meant Yoo Jae Suk,
Yoo Jae Suk meant water gun!

617
00:37:24,050 --> 00:37:26,950
That's why right now...
this is seriously so frustrating.

618
00:37:26,950 --> 00:37:29,450
- I'm telling you, it's not me!
- Jae Suk...

619
00:37:29,450 --> 00:37:30,400
Think about it this way.

620
00:37:30,410 --> 00:37:32,550
You said being shot by the water gun
would infect that person, right?

621
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:35,180
If I really am being Yoo-ames Bond
like you say that I am

622
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:36,940
I wouldn't use the expression,
'infection'.

623
00:37:37,850 --> 00:37:39,560
Why would I infect anyone?

624
00:37:42,570 --> 00:37:44,630
Isn't that why?
I'm making sense, aren't I?

625
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:46,690
Even I can see that what I'm saying
makes perfect sense.

626
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:48,470
I'm really glad that I pointed that out.

627
00:37:48,470 --> 00:37:51,180
Yoo-ames Bond wouldn't use the
expression, 'infection'.

628
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:55,210
- I'm a little unsure now.
- See!

629
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,180
See that?

630
00:37:57,180 --> 00:38:00,850
If I'm the culprit, I wouldn't say, 'infect'.
I'd use the word, 'oust'.

631
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:04,210
But you never know!

632
00:38:04,210 --> 00:38:05,750
I told you, it's not the case!

633
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:08,400
Yoo-ames Bond is not that
type of a person!

634
00:38:11,130 --> 00:38:12,710
Do I really have to get into all this?

635
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:16,140
- Yoo-ames Bond isn't that type of a man!
- Then what kind of a man is he?

636
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:20,780
Yoo-ames Bond doesn't resort to taking
cheap shots like that.

637
00:38:21,050 --> 00:38:22,750
I don't play like that.

638
00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:25,010
I'm saying, Yoo-ames Bond
isn't your culprit.

639
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:27,930
- Yoo-ames Bond?
- Yoo-ames Bond.

640
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:31,680
- And water gun?
- I know Yoo-ames Bond means water gun.

641
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,240
But I'm saying that isn't the case this time.

642
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:36,670
I'm positive... that someone
else is working on the inside.

643
00:38:38,370 --> 00:38:39,740
There's someone amongst us.

644
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:44,130
Using the water gun to frame
Yoo-ames Bond.

645
00:38:44,130 --> 00:38:48,860
[A culprit to frame Yoo-ames Bond through
the usage of water gun?]

646
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:50,270
- I understand, Jae Suk.
- Understand?

647
00:38:55,070 --> 00:38:58,490
[On the other hand...]

648
00:38:58,490 --> 00:39:06,060
[Agent Ha searching around to find the code
for the second entrance to the vaccine room.]

649
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:12,540
[A string?]

650
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,220
There's something down here!

651
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:23,990
[An 'R' marked file attached at
the other end of the string!]

652
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:34,110
[What has six faces with 21 eyes?
The answer to the riddle is the passcode.]

653
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:44,980
This reminds me of the clue
that we had to find in Macau.

654
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:49,550
[That's how he found one of the hints
at the Macau Tower as well.]

655
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:52,400
I think it's time for me to
put on my thinking cap.

656
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,160
I feel like I'm going to lose my mind.

657
00:39:55,250 --> 00:39:57,450
What's the point of finding this
when I can't figure out the answer?

658
00:40:06,450 --> 00:40:07,770
Patient Lee Kwang Soo.

659
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:10,190
I've got the results to your test.

660
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:12,570
It's more serious than we thought.

661
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,470
You're past the point of any treatments.

662
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,900
[Bolts right out of his bed.]

663
00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:19,790
For now...

664
00:40:19,790 --> 00:40:22,860
Weren't you going to treat me
so that I could get better?

665
00:40:24,290 --> 00:40:25,460
We can't treat you.

666
00:40:30,890 --> 00:40:33,100
Don't try to escape,
and just stay right here.

667
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:34,620
There's nothing we can do for you.

668
00:40:35,930 --> 00:40:37,360
Let me go!

669
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:38,850
I'm perfectly fine!

670
00:40:38,850 --> 00:40:40,760
I'm normal!

671
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:46,940
This is absurd.

672
00:40:47,130 --> 00:40:48,630
This is just absurd.

673
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,400
I'm going to escape out of here.

674
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,900
I'm going to escape.

675
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:56,680
[Carrier Giraffe attempting to escape
out of the infirmary.]

676
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:59,320
I have to get out...
I have to get out of here.

677
00:41:06,250 --> 00:41:08,190
[I'm out of here!]

678
00:41:08,990 --> 00:41:12,600
[Giraffe on the loose!]

679
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:17,990
[Giraffe's desperate escape.]

680
00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:21,140
Kwang Soo!
What are you doing here?

681
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:22,710
- I escaped.
- What are you doing?

682
00:41:22,710 --> 00:41:25,770
What are you doing around here?
Tell me what you're up to right now.

683
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:28,530
- What are you?
- I keep feeling so angry.

684
00:41:28,530 --> 00:41:29,950
- Why are you getting angry?
- I just escaped out of there.

685
00:41:29,950 --> 00:41:32,490
- They're coming!
- Tell me what you're doing?

686
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:34,260
- I escaped.
- What are you doing?

687
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:36,230
- I escaped from their clutches.
- Hey, Lee Kwang Soo!

688
00:41:37,830 --> 00:41:40,190
[Agent Jae Suk also discovers the Giraffe.]

689
00:41:40,950 --> 00:41:43,190
Please... save me!

690
00:41:43,190 --> 00:41:45,690
- Jae Suk, I escaped from them.
- What are you doing?

691
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:48,000
Please make me laugh.
I just feel...

692
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,820
I just feel so angry!

693
00:41:50,790 --> 00:41:53,970
[Enraged Giraffe's urge to
attack is activated!]

694
00:41:53,970 --> 00:41:55,660
- Why are you out here?
- What?

695
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:56,580
Why are you out here?

696
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:59,120
Why are you asking me that?
Aren't you even glad to see me?

697
00:41:59,130 --> 00:42:00,430
I thought you were taken away.

698
00:42:00,430 --> 00:42:02,400
I broke out of there.

699
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,800
<i>Intruder!
Catch them!</i>

700
00:42:06,810 --> 00:42:09,870
[Escaping from the situation first!]

701
00:42:14,270 --> 00:42:15,320
- Hey...
- Huh?

702
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:18,580
[Even Ha Ha seems surprised to see
the Giraffe out and about.]

703
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:20,500
- How are you out here?
- I escaped from them.

704
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:22,310
- Why are you here?
- I broke out of jail.

705
00:42:23,210 --> 00:42:25,060
Go back in there.
You can't break out of jail.

706
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:30,600
[No interest whatsoever in
seeing the Giraffe out of jail.]

707
00:42:31,630 --> 00:42:35,640
What the heck is this?
I don't even know what I'm doing today.

708
00:42:35,950 --> 00:42:37,510
Then just get back to jail
and stay there.

709
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:42,430
- We'll make sure to make today fun.
- I worked hard to break out of there.

710
00:42:42,970 --> 00:42:44,690
- You're a carrier of the virus, aren't you?
- Yes.

711
00:42:45,970 --> 00:42:48,560
What's going on?
Why are you being like this?

712
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:50,150
[Special characteristics of a carrier
that he momentarily forgot about.]

713
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:52,470
- What are you doing?
- You're not sure yourself, are you?

714
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:54,170
No, I don't know.

715
00:42:54,170 --> 00:42:56,380
- I just keep feeling angry.
- Where did you just come from?

716
00:42:56,380 --> 00:42:58,360
You're smiling.
You're smiling right now.

717
00:43:01,010 --> 00:43:03,940
Where were you?
Kwang Soo, where were you all this time?

718
00:43:05,150 --> 00:43:06,500
In the examination room.

719
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:09,960
- They kept poking and testing me...
- Who was examining you?

720
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:12,810
- Nurse Go Dong Wan.
- What did you say?

721
00:43:12,850 --> 00:43:14,210
Look, he's smiling again.

722
00:43:15,730 --> 00:43:17,510
[Instant fit of rage.]

723
00:43:17,510 --> 00:43:19,620
What the heck is all this?

724
00:43:21,290 --> 00:43:23,480
- Are you good at solving riddles?
- Yeah.

725
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:26,060
What is it?

726
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:30,770
[Trying to borrow their thinking caps
in order to solve the riddle for the code.]

727
00:43:31,250 --> 00:43:32,730
Let go of me.

728
00:43:32,990 --> 00:43:34,430
Let's just share the information.

729
00:43:34,430 --> 00:43:36,600
- What did you find?
- Tell me what you found.

730
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:38,520
[Riddle - What has six faces and 21 eyes?]

731
00:43:39,150 --> 00:43:43,700
- What has six faces and 21 eyes?
- What?

732
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:47,210
We have to keep this
between ourselves.

733
00:43:49,130 --> 00:43:51,430
[At the same time]

734
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:54,280
[Unauthorized ID]

735
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:57,600
Seriously... are any of these even real?

736
00:43:57,600 --> 00:44:00,030
These are all just a bunch of fake ones!

737
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:02,870
Who are you going to catch?
Who do you think you're going to catch?

738
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:05,370
Who do you think you're going to get?

739
00:44:05,830 --> 00:44:09,170
[Where did his sudden surge of
self-confidence come from?]

740
00:44:09,170 --> 00:44:11,000
This is my third year of doing Running Man!

741
00:44:14,340 --> 00:44:16,390
[Oh... he's pretty fast!]

742
00:44:21,820 --> 00:44:23,440
- Kwang Soo!
- Ji Hyo!

743
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:25,600
Come here! There are
agents back there! This way!

744
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:30,140
[Avoiding getting caught by
the scientists and the security agents.]

745
00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:37,190
- Kwang Soo...
- What is this? Is this for sterilizing?

746
00:44:39,310 --> 00:44:41,940
- We're looking for the vaccine.
- What's going on?

747
00:44:43,710 --> 00:44:44,710
I...

748
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:48,280
- I feel so angry right now.
- Why?

749
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:51,200
[Fits of rage bubbling up constantly
without any prior notice.]

750
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:52,350
What's wrong with you?

751
00:44:54,820 --> 00:44:56,570
I don't think I should stay with him.

752
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:01,970
You startled me!

753
00:45:02,990 --> 00:45:06,290
[Erupting in rage at the staff member
put in charge of the CO2 tank.]

754
00:45:06,750 --> 00:45:09,400
[That must be the rage virus...]

755
00:45:11,870 --> 00:45:14,020
Okay, why don't you just stay here
and keep getting angry?

756
00:45:15,170 --> 00:45:16,860
What is today about?
What are you guys doing today?

757
00:45:16,860 --> 00:45:18,810
I think it's something to do
with water guns.

758
00:45:19,250 --> 00:45:21,520
All I heard was that a water gun
is somehow involved.

759
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:23,760
- Water gun means Jae Suk.
- Right?

760
00:45:24,170 --> 00:45:28,700
Don't you think finding the person with
the water gun would mean we could win?

761
00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:30,790
Then we'd have to rip off
everyone's name tags.

762
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:33,060
Let's do it.
Let's rip off everyone's name tags.

763
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:36,180
[Sorry]

764
00:45:41,990 --> 00:45:47,420
[Jae Suk on the other hand is searching
for the clue to the second passcode.]

765
00:45:48,010 --> 00:45:49,390
Nothing in here.

766
00:46:00,870 --> 00:46:03,470
[The 'R' folder containing the hint!]

767
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:07,010
Seriously...

768
00:46:10,030 --> 00:46:12,220
What the heck is this now?

769
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:21,170
[What is the missing letter in this sequence?
O, T, T, F, (_), S, S, E, N, T.]

770
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:24,820
This is driving me nuts.
O, T, T, F...

771
00:46:24,820 --> 00:46:31,540
[Hint for the correct passcode.
What is the alphabet in this sequence?]

772
00:46:32,050 --> 00:46:35,300
[Another person trying to find
an answer to the mysterious puzzle.]

773
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:41,270
[Six faces with 21 eyes?]

774
00:46:41,270 --> 00:46:43,320
Paper-rock-scissors?
No, that can't be.

775
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:45,220
Six faces...

776
00:46:52,530 --> 00:46:53,950
Dice!

777
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:00,220
One, two, three, four, five, six sides.

778
00:47:00,220 --> 00:47:03,750
There are six faces, and a total
of 21 dots if you count them all.

779
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:07,940
[Dice with six sides and
a total of 21 dots counting from 1-6!]

780
00:47:08,790 --> 00:47:12,880
[Agent Ha convinced that 'Dice'
is the correct answer to the riddle.]

781
00:47:19,130 --> 00:47:23,540
What has six faces and 21 eyes?

782
00:47:24,220 --> 00:47:26,790
Dice!

783
00:47:31,580 --> 00:47:36,020
[Finally succeeds in infiltrating
the vaccine storage room!]

784
00:47:53,790 --> 00:47:58,560
[Carrier Giraffe never even having seen
what an ID badge looks like all day.]

785
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:00,530
I need to rip off the name tag
of at least one scientist.

786
00:48:01,530 --> 00:48:04,740
My illness... is something I myself...

787
00:48:07,620 --> 00:48:10,470
[Why not find your way back in first?]

788
00:48:10,570 --> 00:48:14,000
<i>Intruder Ji Suk Jin has been infected.
Quarantine measures to be taken.</i>

789
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:17,600
<i>Intruder Ji Suk Jin has been infected.
Quarantine measures to be taken.</i>

790
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:23,640
[This time... it's Suk Jin?]

791
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:24,900
What does this mean?

792
00:48:25,790 --> 00:48:27,750
Someone else has been ousted?
But how is that possible?

793
00:48:27,750 --> 00:48:30,350
How do you oust someone?

794
00:48:30,350 --> 00:48:31,680
What's going on?

795
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:38,860
How can this happen?

796
00:48:40,390 --> 00:48:43,570
<i>Intruder Ji Suk Jin has been infected.
Quarantine measures to be taken.</i>

797
00:48:43,570 --> 00:48:44,590
I'm a carrier?

798
00:48:44,590 --> 00:48:46,920
<i>Intruder Ji Suk Jin has been infected.
Quarantine measures to be taken.</i>

799
00:48:52,770 --> 00:48:54,080
Where are you taking me?

800
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:58,660
[The culprit behind all these events is...]

801
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,200
Gary...

802
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:03,420
I think...

803
00:49:05,210 --> 00:49:07,550
What happens to ousted members?
And what is going on around here?

804
00:49:07,550 --> 00:49:09,060
You know what the real big problem is?

805
00:49:13,540 --> 00:49:18,460
[Carrier Giraffe having donned a clean room
garment in fear for his life?]

806
00:49:18,460 --> 00:49:20,030
Why are you pant legs all ripped?

807
00:49:21,260 --> 00:49:22,570
What is today about?

808
00:49:22,570 --> 00:49:24,700
[Still unaware of what's going on today.]

809
00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:26,130
Why isn't Jae Suk here?

810
00:49:26,790 --> 00:49:29,750
- Why do you think he's missing?
- Jong Kook and Suk Jin are out, right?

811
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:32,340
What the heck is that noise?

812
00:49:32,340 --> 00:49:37,460
[A mysterious bird sound that can be heard
all over the biological research facility.]

813
00:49:39,410 --> 00:49:42,230
[We heard it once before
a little while ago...]

814
00:49:42,230 --> 00:49:44,610
- Isn't it a bird sound?
- Bird?

815
00:49:48,790 --> 00:49:52,760
[There's no way this is happening
for no reason...]

816
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:57,510
[What is the meaning of the bird noise?]

817
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,490
<i>- Kwang Soo!
- Yes, Ha Ha?</i>

818
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:07,130
[The agents trying to figure out the
meaning of the sudden bird noises.]

819
00:50:07,140 --> 00:50:10,230
- Maybe it's a signal alerting the time.
- That's what I think too.

820
00:50:10,230 --> 00:50:11,870
- When the bird sounds...
- Do you know this?

821
00:50:11,870 --> 00:50:15,090
- Who's the worst enemy to bugs?
- Birds.

822
00:50:15,580 --> 00:50:17,580
Grasshopper... that's a bug.

823
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:22,840
[Therefore, it's an enemy sign
to the Grasshopper?]

824
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:27,940
The sound means that it's getting close for
Jae Suk to accomplish some kind of a mission.

825
00:50:27,950 --> 00:50:30,360
[A warning sign of some sort for Jae Suk?]

826
00:50:31,410 --> 00:50:32,840
- Then Jae Suk...
- The culprit...

827
00:50:34,460 --> 00:50:36,060
is Jae Suk.

828
00:50:36,810 --> 00:50:37,840
I knew it.

829
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:40,670
The one who took away your livelihood,
and your laughter...

830
00:50:40,670 --> 00:50:42,470
Why is Jae Suk doing this to me?

831
00:50:43,410 --> 00:50:45,350
Why did he steal away my laughter?

832
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:47,020
Why do you think that is?

833
00:50:47,570 --> 00:50:48,870
I can't believe this.

834
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:54,470
I have to stop him.

835
00:50:54,470 --> 00:50:57,230
I have to make Jae Suk wake up and
realize what he did to me!

836
00:50:57,910 --> 00:50:59,520
The only person who can stop this...

837
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:01,280
there is only one person.

838
00:51:01,990 --> 00:51:03,370
And that's me.

839
00:51:04,290 --> 00:51:07,020
You have to help me.

840
00:51:11,250 --> 00:51:13,060
Get yourself together.
We have to do this!

841
00:51:14,290 --> 00:51:16,160
But why would Jae Suk do this?

842
00:51:17,950 --> 00:51:22,580
[What is Jae Suk's real purpose?]

843
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:24,280
It's hot in here again.

844
00:51:26,070 --> 00:51:27,670
It's really hot in here.

845
00:51:28,750 --> 00:51:30,600
It's a desert in here.

846
00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:33,340
Gary...

847
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:36,190
- Hey.
- Jae Suk, did you find anything?

848
00:51:36,750 --> 00:51:38,780
- I haven't found anything.
- I'm being serious.

849
00:51:38,780 --> 00:51:40,810
- I am serious.
- I have no idea what's going on.

850
00:51:40,810 --> 00:51:44,350
- I've just been wandering around like this.
- Have you been in the room yet?

851
00:51:44,350 --> 00:51:46,080
- Where?
- The vaccine room.

852
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:48,780
- I have been in there.
- I've been in the room too.

853
00:51:48,790 --> 00:51:50,310
- You had to know the passcode, right?
- Yes.

854
00:51:50,310 --> 00:51:51,670
I don't know what the passcode is.

855
00:51:54,020 --> 00:51:56,300
- Why did Jong Kook get ousted?
- I don't know.

856
00:51:56,300 --> 00:51:58,400
- It's the water gun.
- Really?

857
00:51:58,400 --> 00:51:59,870
Who shot him?

858
00:52:03,630 --> 00:52:05,150
When it comes to water guns, it's you.

859
00:52:05,150 --> 00:52:07,400
- You're always with the water guns.
- It's not me.

860
00:52:07,410 --> 00:52:11,540
You know that shooting with the water gun
means the person is infected.

861
00:52:11,540 --> 00:52:12,880
It's not me.

862
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:14,660
It's eliminating the person anyway.

863
00:52:14,660 --> 00:52:19,690
Yoo-ames Bond is not a bad person like that.
He just ousts people with the water gun.

864
00:52:20,970 --> 00:52:23,610
Either way, it's not me.
Hey... it's not me.

865
00:52:23,610 --> 00:52:25,640
- Gary, it's not me.
- Something not right.

866
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:28,080
It really isn't me.

867
00:52:36,730 --> 00:52:40,790
[Giraffe wanting to be able to laugh again
goes out in search for the vaccine.]

868
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:43,620
[Gains an ID badge.]

869
00:52:48,090 --> 00:52:49,970
[Solely focused on gaining the ID's.]

870
00:52:50,730 --> 00:52:51,950
Thank you.

871
00:52:58,330 --> 00:53:03,230
[The rage virus is
bubbling under the surface.]

872
00:53:06,220 --> 00:53:08,010
Oh my goodness!

873
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:16,580
[Gathering up all the ID's one by one.]

874
00:53:16,580 --> 00:53:20,710
[Heading towards the storage room in
search of a way to save himself.]

875
00:53:24,340 --> 00:53:27,640
[Coming face to face with Agent Jae Suk
in front of the vaccine storage room.]

876
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:30,110
Jae Suk, I've found three
of these badges.

877
00:53:31,170 --> 00:53:32,710
Kwang Soo...

878
00:53:32,710 --> 00:53:34,610
What is it?
Did you find something?

879
00:53:34,610 --> 00:53:37,700
Having that...
isn't going to get you anywhere.

880
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:43,200
[Jae Suk...]

881
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:48,250
[You... are behind this, aren't you?]

882
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:53,100
- What the heck is this?
- The sequence...

883
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:57,260
[Clueless as to what the passcode is.]

884
00:53:58,370 --> 00:54:00,260
Don't you feel angry at all, Kwang Soo?

885
00:54:02,850 --> 00:54:04,570
He keeps doing this to me.

886
00:54:04,570 --> 00:54:06,910
- Why would he get mad?
- Whenever I try to do anything...

887
00:54:06,910 --> 00:54:08,370
Why would he be feeling
angry right now?

888
00:54:08,380 --> 00:54:11,140
For the past eight hours,
he's been doing this to me all day.

889
00:54:12,210 --> 00:54:17,960
[Making the infected carrier keep bursting
out in anger as symptoms indicates him to.]

890
00:54:18,230 --> 00:54:20,920
Whenever I take a break from getting
angry, and try to get something done...

891
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:23,840
[Constantly showing fits of anger
whenever he was prompted to do.]

892
00:54:23,850 --> 00:54:25,950
- It's annoying!
- Let's try to solve this.

893
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:27,970
- Should we try to solve it?
- Yeah, solve it.

894
00:54:28,630 --> 00:54:33,040
[Jae Suk telling Kwang Soo he should
try using his ID's for verification.]

895
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:35,120
- I'll try out my ID's right now.
- Okay.

896
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:37,620
But that's...

897
00:54:39,490 --> 00:54:42,020
- I'll check to see if this works first.
- Try it.

898
00:54:42,020 --> 00:54:43,860
Try it and see if yours works.

899
00:54:45,870 --> 00:54:47,410
Go ahead and see if it works.

900
00:54:55,540 --> 00:54:58,740
[Something feels off...
I can't let my guard down.]

901
00:55:04,330 --> 00:55:05,680
That one didn't work.

902
00:55:06,730 --> 00:55:08,550
- Yours doesn't work?
- The second one didn't work either.

903
00:55:08,550 --> 00:55:10,220
- How many do you have?
- Three.

904
00:55:10,910 --> 00:55:13,010
I'm really serious about this right now.

905
00:55:13,010 --> 00:55:15,590
- Why have you gotten so strong lately?
- You should be careful too.

906
00:55:17,260 --> 00:55:19,890
[What?]

907
00:55:20,990 --> 00:55:23,220
[Water gun!]

908
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:29,800
[That is without a doubt, a water gun!]

909
00:55:41,460 --> 00:55:45,210
[He shoots Kwang Soo's name tag
with the water gun!]

910
00:55:49,350 --> 00:55:51,680
[What in the world!]

911
00:55:54,830 --> 00:55:57,200
You should've at least been a little
more covert about it.

912
00:55:58,940 --> 00:56:00,850
How could you do this again?

913
00:56:00,850 --> 00:56:02,790
[Exploding in a real fit of rage!]

914
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:11,670
[Is it really... Yoo-ames Bond?]

915
00:56:16,260 --> 00:56:24,920
[The clear green water gun mark left on
these ousted members' name tags...]

916
00:56:30,140 --> 00:56:35,560
[Does it mean that they were all a result
of Yoo-ames Bond's actions?]

917
00:56:37,830 --> 00:56:43,140
[Infected carrier Giraffe being
taken away.]

918
00:56:43,140 --> 00:56:44,410
Kwang Soo!

919
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:47,720
What is it?
What's going on?

920
00:56:47,980 --> 00:56:50,810
[Automatically bursting out in rage
without being prompted by anyone.]

921
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:58,090
[Everyone's just standing by watching this
scene with a shocked expression.]

922
00:57:01,570 --> 00:57:03,840
You should've made it less obvious
than this water gun.

923
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:06,830
This is just total entrapment.

924
00:57:06,830 --> 00:57:09,180
[Entrapment?]

925
00:57:11,290 --> 00:57:12,740
Who is it?

926
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:15,330
Who could it be?

927
00:57:16,330 --> 00:57:18,310
This is really getting more and more...

928
00:57:18,310 --> 00:57:20,600
I really don't know what's
going on now.

929
00:57:21,670 --> 00:57:23,120
[Is he searching for someone?]

930
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:28,900
[What is going on?]

931
00:57:28,900 --> 00:57:34,750
[What does any of this mean?]

932
00:57:36,990 --> 00:57:40,180
[Two hours ago]

933
00:57:41,020 --> 00:57:44,690
[Jae Suk having arrived at the facility in
search of the laughter vaccine with others.]

934
00:57:44,690 --> 00:57:48,020
<i>Only the person who finds the
laughter vaccine will be the sole winner.</i>

935
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:51,310
I have no idea what you're
talking about.

936
00:57:53,130 --> 00:57:54,480
Go Dong Wan!

937
00:57:55,900 --> 00:58:00,750
[The place Nurse Go Dong Wan
leads him to is...]

938
00:58:00,750 --> 00:58:04,080
[A secret door inside the closet?]

939
00:58:05,740 --> 00:58:14,840
[The same door through which Bond received
his secret mission during parts one and two!]

940
00:58:16,150 --> 00:58:21,480
[As guessed, a secret door!]

941
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:23,800
Yoo-ames Bond, Yoo Jae Suk.

942
00:58:25,060 --> 00:58:27,860
You are about to get framed.

943
00:58:27,860 --> 00:58:30,200
- You're about to be framed.
- Why am I getting framed?

944
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:33,840
Someone on the outside...

945
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:36,310
is shooting people with a water gun
to mark them with green fluid...

946
00:58:37,060 --> 00:58:43,260
to infect the members with the virus.
That's the tip we've just received.

947
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:48,760
[Yoo-ames Bond, find out who's
framing you!]

948
00:58:51,330 --> 00:58:56,630
[Yoo-ames Bond's trademark,
water guns are on display!]

949
00:58:59,190 --> 00:59:00,930
Use these water guns...

950
00:59:00,930 --> 00:59:04,490
to shoot the name tag of the real culprit
who's trying to frame you.

951
00:59:05,130 --> 00:59:07,410
By which you'll infect the culprit,
and oust that person.

952
00:59:07,820 --> 00:59:10,490
I'm going be had without
any choice on my part.

953
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:18,560
But if you get shot by the real culprit
instead of shooting the culprit yourself...

954
00:59:18,970 --> 00:59:21,890
or your gold bracelet gets stolen,
you'll be ousted so be careful.

955
00:59:21,890 --> 00:59:24,030
[If shot by the real culprit's gun or
the gold bracelet is stolen, he's ousted!]

956
00:59:24,740 --> 00:59:26,950
Find out who the real culprit is,
and oust that person.

957
00:59:26,950 --> 00:59:30,920
Then retrieve the last surviving
laughter vaccine to save humanity.

958
00:59:30,920 --> 00:59:34,430
I encourage you to become
the ultimate winner and savior.

959
00:59:34,430 --> 00:59:38,530
- What are you saying?
- This is your mission.

960
00:59:41,250 --> 00:59:43,400
I don't think it's going to be
easy this time.

961
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:46,440
[An uneasy feeling that this mission
won't be so simple.]

962
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:48,460
- The real culprit is executing the mission.
- I know.

963
00:59:48,470 --> 00:59:51,590
<i>The real culprit is using green fluid.</i>

964
00:59:51,590 --> 00:59:57,050
<i>The person is out there trying to
frame you for their crimes.</i>

965
01:00:06,980 --> 01:00:08,420
<i>Where are you taking me?</i>

966
01:00:08,430 --> 01:00:09,770
<i>What's going on?</i>

967
01:00:13,430 --> 01:00:20,070
<i>Intruder Kim Jong Kook is infected.
Quarantine measures to be taken.</i>

968
01:00:20,940 --> 01:00:23,620
What does that mean?
Just who's going around doing this?

969
01:00:25,360 --> 01:00:27,040
Who is the culprit?

970
01:00:27,660 --> 01:00:28,910
I'm infected now?

971
01:00:28,910 --> 01:00:32,670
[Comrades having taken the fall
without even knowing what's going on.]

972
01:00:32,670 --> 01:00:39,490
<i>Intruder Ji Suk Jin is infected.
Quarantine measures to be taken.</i>

973
01:00:39,490 --> 01:00:42,400
[The culprit... just who are you?]

974
01:00:44,210 --> 01:00:47,840
[Yoo-ames Bond... he's been
searching for the real culprit!]

975
01:00:50,110 --> 01:00:56,920
[Thinking that Kwang Soo could be the culprit
since he's already an infected carrier.]

976
01:00:57,860 --> 01:01:01,030
[That's why he was shot down
without even any hesitation.]

977
01:01:07,580 --> 01:01:12,080
[But he wasn't the real culprit
who stole the laughter vaccine away.]

978
01:01:16,920 --> 01:01:21,840
[Sorry... I'll make sure
to catch the real culprit.]

979
01:01:28,750 --> 01:01:30,580
It's someone on the inside.
It's one of us.

980
01:01:34,370 --> 01:01:40,900
[The real culprit...
is one of these members.]

981
01:01:41,270 --> 01:01:47,040
[The culprit who infected my comrades,
and took laughter away from humanity...]

982
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:48,570
I will get you!

983
01:01:53,860 --> 01:01:59,500
[Framed Yoo-ames Bond vs. Real culprit.
The real battle starts now!]

984
01:02:02,410 --> 01:02:08,110
[What is the next letter in this sequence?]

985
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:11,870
[Did he figure out the answer?]

986
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:18,120
One, two, three, four...

987
01:02:20,230 --> 01:02:21,910
You know this, don't you?

988
01:02:21,910 --> 01:02:23,310
You knew this, didn't you?

989
01:02:26,630 --> 01:02:30,640
[Rushing over to the
vaccine storage room.]

990
01:02:35,170 --> 01:02:36,990
This is the answer to the passcode clue.

991
01:02:36,990 --> 01:02:40,770
F.
[The answer if 'F' for five.]

992
01:02:42,460 --> 01:02:46,180
[Finally entering the inner room
where the vaccine is kept.]

993
01:02:46,190 --> 01:02:48,420
This is seriously too much.
This is too hard.

994
01:02:48,420 --> 01:02:49,550
What the heck?

995
01:02:49,550 --> 01:02:52,720
[It's empty?]

996
01:02:52,730 --> 01:02:54,220
The culprit already took it.

997
01:02:58,650 --> 01:03:05,260
[The laughter vaccine, the culprit
seems to have taken it already.]

998
01:03:13,590 --> 01:03:15,070
What I think is...

999
01:03:15,650 --> 01:03:17,320
I don't suspect you.

1000
01:03:18,310 --> 01:03:20,180
I think it's Jae Suk.

1001
01:03:21,660 --> 01:03:26,110
[Yoo-ames Bond picks the perfect
time to make his appearance.]

1002
01:03:28,920 --> 01:03:30,700
Jae Suk, how far have you gone?

1003
01:03:30,700 --> 01:03:32,120
What do you mean, how far have I gone?

1004
01:03:32,840 --> 01:03:34,740
Are you suspecting me right now?

1005
01:03:35,300 --> 01:03:37,890
The glint in your eye tells me that
you guys suspect me right now.

1006
01:03:38,540 --> 01:03:40,850
We are suspicious of you.

1007
01:03:40,850 --> 01:03:43,870
To be honest...
Is it okay for me to search you?

1008
01:03:45,240 --> 01:03:47,480
- Go ahead.
- Okay.

1009
01:03:48,250 --> 01:03:50,190
Put your hands on your head.

1010
01:03:50,190 --> 01:03:52,050
I find this really offensive.

1011
01:03:52,050 --> 01:03:53,450
I can't do anything about it.

1012
01:03:53,450 --> 01:03:56,170
[He's going to get framed even more once
Ha Ha discovers his water gun.]

1013
01:03:56,170 --> 01:03:57,830
Prove to us that it's not you.

1014
01:04:00,710 --> 01:04:01,950
- What are you doing?
- That's not it?

1015
01:04:01,950 --> 01:04:03,640
- You scared me!
- Does he have something?

1016
01:04:03,640 --> 01:04:07,460
[Starting to become more and more
wary and suspicious of one another.]

1017
01:04:07,890 --> 01:04:10,880
- Can I search you too?
- Yes. But I'll go first.

1018
01:04:10,920 --> 01:04:12,620
Let me search you first.

1019
01:04:13,190 --> 01:04:15,010
- I'll do it first.
- No, I'll search you first.

1020
01:04:15,010 --> 01:04:17,230
- No.
- After hearing what Ji Hyo said...

1021
01:04:17,230 --> 01:04:20,170
Don't even think about using that
to oust me right now.

1022
01:04:21,740 --> 01:04:25,670
[Haroro aggressively targeting Jae Suk.]

1023
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:27,700
- I can't believe all this distrust.
- Hang on a second.

1024
01:04:27,700 --> 01:04:31,230
[Yoo-ames Bond starting to get
backed up into a corner.]

1025
01:04:33,600 --> 01:04:36,350
- Do you really have to be like this?
- Yes. Let me see your belt.

1026
01:04:37,140 --> 01:04:41,930
[How will Yoo-ames Bond get himself
out of this danger?]

1027
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:44,130
- Turn around.
- I can't do that.

1028
01:04:44,130 --> 01:04:45,360
It's back there, isn't it?

1029
01:04:46,150 --> 01:04:47,640
Is it in his waistband?

1030
01:04:48,780 --> 01:04:54,090
[It's possible that the real culprit
could be Ha Ha or Ji Hyo...]

1031
01:04:54,990 --> 01:04:57,620
- It's not me.
- And actually...

1032
01:04:57,620 --> 01:05:00,970
Jae Suk recently washed his hands.
I can smell the soap on his hands.

1033
01:05:00,970 --> 01:05:04,270
No, that's just because I've been
touching everything and they're dirty.

1034
01:05:04,270 --> 01:05:05,780
He recently washed his hands.
You know why?

1035
01:05:05,780 --> 01:05:08,470
It's because he had watercolor
on his hands. Why?

1036
01:05:08,470 --> 01:05:10,690
[Haroro takes the chance and
corners Jae Suk even further!]

1037
01:05:10,690 --> 01:05:12,810
How does it feel to be taken down
by Ha-lock Holmes?

1038
01:05:13,610 --> 01:05:15,960
Hey, look at him!
He's reaching back for something!

1039
01:05:15,960 --> 01:05:17,750
His hand's reaching for something!

1040
01:05:19,700 --> 01:05:21,540
You brats!

1041
01:05:21,540 --> 01:05:24,110
- Wait! Wait!
- I told you that it's not me!

1042
01:05:24,110 --> 01:05:27,930
[Escapes danger by threatening them.]

1043
01:05:28,810 --> 01:05:30,310
This is driving me crazy.

1044
01:05:31,340 --> 01:05:32,670
This is a big problem.

1045
01:05:32,670 --> 01:05:34,260
What do I do?

1046
01:05:34,260 --> 01:05:36,260
This is getting more and more
complicated.

1047
01:05:37,840 --> 01:05:39,420
Is it Jae Suk?
Are you sure?

1048
01:05:39,980 --> 01:05:41,550
I think it is.
I think it's him.

1049
01:05:43,490 --> 01:05:49,860
[He's about to get ousted by his comrades,
let alone catch the real culprit!]

1050
01:05:52,110 --> 01:05:54,370
I just helped frame myself even further.

1051
01:05:54,920 --> 01:05:56,480
Who is the real culprit?

1052
01:05:56,530 --> 01:06:04,280
[Just who is the real culprit that's
pushed Yoo-ames Bond into the corner?]

1053
01:06:09,420 --> 01:06:11,130
Ha Ha... it's Ha Ha!

1054
01:06:11,830 --> 01:06:12,970
It's Ha Ha.

1055
01:06:17,350 --> 01:06:18,660
It's...

1056
01:06:19,100 --> 01:06:21,690
The culprit is one of those three.

1057
01:06:21,690 --> 01:06:22,790
[The real culprit is either,
Gary, Ha Ha or Ji Hyo!]

1058
01:06:22,790 --> 01:06:29,590
[There's only one chance!
Must figure out who the real culprit is!]

1059
01:06:32,140 --> 01:06:33,650
It's Ha Ha.
I'm sure it's Ha Ha.

1060
01:06:35,300 --> 01:06:36,490
Ha Ha...

1061
01:06:38,100 --> 01:06:40,960
He tried to corner me
too aggressively earlier.

1062
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:44,510
Ha Ha was the only one who saw
everyone getting ousted.

1063
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:46,610
Gary!

1064
01:06:47,270 --> 01:06:48,740
Water gun.
It's the water gun!

1065
01:06:48,740 --> 01:06:50,340
[The only witness to comrades
getting infected was Ha Ha!]

1066
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:53,770
Jong Kook...

1067
01:06:53,770 --> 01:06:55,270
Suk Jin...

1068
01:06:55,690 --> 01:06:58,280
Ha Ha saw them both.
No one else saw them getting infected.

1069
01:07:00,020 --> 01:07:04,350
[Is Ha Ha the real culprit as
Yoo-ames Bond is guessing it to be?]

1070
01:07:10,070 --> 01:07:11,780
You're coming to get me, aren't you?

1071
01:07:11,780 --> 01:07:13,910
- What?
- You're coming to get me.

1072
01:07:13,910 --> 01:07:16,520
- No, I'm not.
- Seeing the two of you together...

1073
01:07:16,530 --> 01:07:19,860
[Gary and Ha Ha approaching
Agent Blank.]

1074
01:07:19,860 --> 01:07:22,150
I think we need to start
trusting each other.

1075
01:07:22,530 --> 01:07:25,590
Let's show each other our ankles.

1076
01:07:26,140 --> 01:07:28,750
Okay, don't come any closer.
I'll show you my ankles.

1077
01:07:31,330 --> 01:07:33,530
- My ankles?
- They're so slim.

1078
01:07:33,540 --> 01:07:36,780
- Show us your shoes.
- You're not going to jump me, right?

1079
01:07:36,780 --> 01:07:39,700
No, I won't. Then let's all
sit down and do it together.

1080
01:07:39,700 --> 01:07:41,100
- You sit down too.
- Okay.

1081
01:07:42,030 --> 01:07:44,530
- What are we doing?
- Sit down and show us.

1082
01:07:45,290 --> 01:07:48,650
- We don't trust each other right now.
- It's not me.

1083
01:07:48,650 --> 01:07:50,180
It's not me either.

1084
01:07:50,180 --> 01:07:51,740
I'll be the judge since it's not me.

1085
01:07:52,240 --> 01:07:53,780
What are you saying?

1086
01:07:53,780 --> 01:07:57,080
I'm telling you, it's not me.
I'm serious!

1087
01:07:58,040 --> 01:08:00,540
Fine, let's do it.
I'll do whatever you want.

1088
01:08:02,380 --> 01:08:04,470
What do you want me to do?

1089
01:08:04,470 --> 01:08:08,210
[Why is Ha Ha getting so upset?]

1090
01:08:08,210 --> 01:08:09,430
Why are you getting upset?

1091
01:08:10,120 --> 01:08:12,670
- You're acting strange.
- Okay, then search me.

1092
01:08:13,420 --> 01:08:16,540
Guys... if we can't find the vaccine...

1093
01:08:17,300 --> 01:08:19,790
humanity is going to lose
their ability to laugh forever!

1094
01:08:20,900 --> 01:08:23,040
Do you want to lose your livelihood?

1095
01:08:24,060 --> 01:08:27,440
The Monday Couple will be no more!

1096
01:08:27,440 --> 01:08:31,990
Haroro will disappear, and
Running Man itself is going to disappear!

1097
01:08:32,970 --> 01:08:35,660
- I think you're acting suspicious.
- Okay, let's go.

1098
01:08:38,400 --> 01:08:40,710
[Jae Suk witnessing this whole scene.]

1099
01:08:40,710 --> 01:08:42,200
Gary, it's not me.
It really isn't me!

1100
01:08:42,200 --> 01:08:45,190
- Jae Suk!
- The real culprit is amongst you guys!

1101
01:08:45,190 --> 01:08:47,610
- What are you talking about?
- The real culprit is in your group.

1102
01:08:48,020 --> 01:08:52,180
One of you three stole the vaccine
and is infecting everyone.

1103
01:08:52,180 --> 01:08:54,160
- Infect? It really isn't me.
- Jae Suk...

1104
01:08:54,160 --> 01:08:57,780
[Just which one of these three
is the real culprit?]

1105
01:08:57,790 --> 01:08:59,450
Be careful.
You have to watch out for Ha Ha.

1106
01:08:59,450 --> 01:09:00,900
- Don't believe him.
- You have to listen to me.

1107
01:09:00,900 --> 01:09:03,530
- I swear it's not me.
- Show us your arms.

1108
01:09:03,530 --> 01:09:07,280
[Requesting Yoo-ames Bond to show
his wrist to confirm devoid of any bands.]

1109
01:09:07,280 --> 01:09:08,500
I'm being honest.

1110
01:09:08,500 --> 01:09:10,250
I'm serious, it's not me.

1111
01:09:11,770 --> 01:09:15,310
[Luckily the band is inside his pant leg!]

1112
01:09:15,310 --> 01:09:18,240
Jae Suk, why did you kill Kwang Soo?
Why did you kill Kwang Soo?

1113
01:09:19,280 --> 01:09:21,540
- I had no choice but to eliminate him.
- How did you kill him?

1114
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:24,670
- I killed Kwang Soo with a water gun.
- How did you kill him with a water gun?

1115
01:09:24,670 --> 01:09:27,070
But I didn't say that I killed Kwang Soo
by infecting him, did I?

1116
01:09:27,070 --> 01:09:28,690
What did the announcement
say about Kwang Soo?

1117
01:09:28,690 --> 01:09:30,540
- There was no announcement made.
- Right?

1118
01:09:30,540 --> 01:09:32,120
See? He wasn't infected.

1119
01:09:32,120 --> 01:09:33,800
But why do you have a water gun?

1120
01:09:34,220 --> 01:09:37,450
- And why don't any of us have a water gun?
- One of you three...

1121
01:09:37,450 --> 01:09:41,240
I don't know which one of you,
but I have to oust one of you.

1122
01:09:41,240 --> 01:09:42,710
That's my mission.

1123
01:09:43,830 --> 01:09:46,770
- You're lying!
- Intruder alert!

1124
01:09:53,910 --> 01:09:55,630
- Gary...
- Jae Suk.

1125
01:09:55,630 --> 01:09:57,250
What's going on?

1126
01:09:57,250 --> 01:09:59,870
I want you to be honest with me.

1127
01:09:59,880 --> 01:10:01,290
I...

1128
01:10:01,290 --> 01:10:02,800
I've been watching what's going on.

1129
01:10:04,620 --> 01:10:06,320
I think Ha Ha is the culprit.

1130
01:10:06,320 --> 01:10:09,130
- He's acting very suspicious.
- I'm suspicious of him too.

1131
01:10:09,130 --> 01:10:14,420
[Gary is also feeling suspicious of Ha Ha.]

1132
01:10:14,420 --> 01:10:15,960
Ha Ha wouldn't show us.

1133
01:10:19,240 --> 01:10:21,990
After hearing what's going on,
I think you're acting a little suspicious.

1134
01:10:21,990 --> 01:10:24,240
[Ji Hyo is also starting to get
suspicious of Ha Ha.]

1135
01:10:24,240 --> 01:10:26,650
- You saw everyone getting ousted.
- Yeah.

1136
01:10:26,650 --> 01:10:28,180
I wasn't the only one who saw it.

1137
01:10:28,180 --> 01:10:29,760
- Then who else saw it?
- We saw it together.

1138
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:30,880
- With whom?
- Gary.

1139
01:10:31,940 --> 01:10:33,810
Gary didn't see both.
He only saw one getting ousted.

1140
01:10:33,810 --> 01:10:35,430
I saw one by myself.

1141
01:10:38,120 --> 01:10:39,390
What I...

1142
01:10:39,390 --> 01:10:41,110
What I was surprised by was...

1143
01:10:41,720 --> 01:10:43,220
after thinking about it carefully

1144
01:10:43,220 --> 01:10:46,730
HaHa is the only one
who saw everyone getting ousted.

1145
01:10:46,730 --> 01:10:48,370
- You're right.
- Except Kwang Soo, because I ousted him.

1146
01:10:49,030 --> 01:10:54,630
[Is Ha Ha, the only witness to everyone
getting ousted by the real culprit?]

1147
01:10:54,630 --> 01:10:56,970
- Really?
- He showed me Suk Jin getting dragged away.

1148
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:00,300
It's Ha Ha.

1149
01:11:00,300 --> 01:11:04,250
Jae Suk... is your water gun the only
way of eliminating Ha Ha?

1150
01:11:04,250 --> 01:11:10,680
[Yoo-ames Bond's water gun is the only means
of getting rid of the culprit, Ha Ha!]

1151
01:11:10,680 --> 01:11:16,380
[But if Jae Suk's guess is correct,
then Ha Ha also has a water gun!]

1152
01:11:21,300 --> 01:11:26,090
You're acting suspicious too.
You can't be this clueless, can you?

1153
01:11:26,720 --> 01:11:28,110
You're Song Ji Hyo!

1154
01:11:28,110 --> 01:11:30,100
Why? I'm not allowed to
remain clueless?

1155
01:11:30,100 --> 01:11:32,130
You're the Ace!
Don't you think it's too weird?

1156
01:11:32,130 --> 01:11:33,380
What is?

1157
01:11:33,390 --> 01:11:36,540
Let's not get swept away by
what Jae Suk is saying.

1158
01:11:36,840 --> 01:11:38,440
I feel a little unsure.

1159
01:11:39,900 --> 01:11:44,040
- I'm uncertain right now.
- Really? Then let's go our own ways.

1160
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:47,560
I'll do it my way,
so you do things your own way.

1161
01:11:47,560 --> 01:11:48,790
Okay then.

1162
01:11:49,950 --> 01:11:52,020
- Okay.
- Okay.

1163
01:11:54,240 --> 01:11:55,700
Bird sounds...

1164
01:11:56,300 --> 01:11:57,670
What does the bird sound mean?

1165
01:11:59,360 --> 01:12:04,210
[When Blank Ji, Gary, Ha Ha and
Kwang Soo were all together...]

1166
01:12:04,210 --> 01:12:08,540
[And even when Blank Ji and the Giraffe
were together, the bird sound was heard.]

1167
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:11,080
Whenever Ji Hyo and I are together,
the bird sound goes off.

1168
01:12:12,850 --> 01:12:14,800
- Okay.
- Okay.

1169
01:12:19,080 --> 01:12:20,570
Jae Suk... Jae Suk!

1170
01:12:22,780 --> 01:12:24,200
Find him and bring him to me!

1171
01:12:24,200 --> 01:12:27,510
[Gary to lure Ha Ha over to Jae Suk,
for Jae Suk to eliminate with his water gun!]

1172
01:12:36,810 --> 01:12:38,880
I'm a carrier...

1173
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:41,420
and whenever a carrier and Ji Hyo are
together, the bird sound goes off.

1174
01:12:42,160 --> 01:12:46,070
[That means...]

1175
01:13:07,770 --> 01:13:10,200
[Green watermark on Ha Ha's name tag!]

1176
01:13:18,620 --> 01:13:21,480
<i>Intruder Ha Ha is infected!
Quarantine measures to be taken!</i>

1177
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:23,250
<i>Intruder HaHa is infected!
Quarantine measures to be taken!</i>

1178
01:13:23,250 --> 01:13:25,770
[What?]

1179
01:13:28,430 --> 01:13:29,760
Why?

1180
01:13:31,220 --> 01:13:34,240
No!
I'm the star of the show today!

1181
01:13:34,240 --> 01:13:36,050
No!

1182
01:13:36,050 --> 01:13:37,580
This can't happen!

1183
01:13:37,580 --> 01:13:38,580
I'm too close!

1184
01:13:38,580 --> 01:13:41,570
Wait... wait!

1185
01:13:42,240 --> 01:13:43,650
It was Song Ji Hyo.

1186
01:13:43,650 --> 01:13:45,090
Song Ji Hyo...

1187
01:13:45,980 --> 01:13:49,320
I was with Song Ji Hyo last,
and she got me.

1188
01:13:49,320 --> 01:13:51,190
[The woman no one ever suspected...]

1189
01:13:51,190 --> 01:13:53,270
Rip off the name tag and
let me see it.

1190
01:14:08,100 --> 01:14:10,560
[Five hours ago]

1191
01:14:16,660 --> 01:14:17,760
What's that sound?

1192
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:20,510
[A mysterious USB in Blank Ji's car.]

1193
01:14:20,520 --> 01:14:21,740
<i>Miss Song Ji Hyo?</i>

1194
01:14:21,740 --> 01:14:28,440
<i>The International Angry Group has
a special and important mission for you.</i>

1195
01:14:29,550 --> 01:14:34,610
<i>We can't stand to watch the world
be so happy anymore.</i>

1196
01:14:34,610 --> 01:14:37,820
<i>Steal the laughter vaccine
and hand it over to us.</i>

1197
01:14:38,480 --> 01:14:44,000
<i>The one and only vaccine left in this world
is kept in the vaccine storage room.</i>

1198
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:48,780
<i>Use the pass key and the lock key
that are included in the case provided</i>

1199
01:14:48,780 --> 01:14:51,650
<i>which will aide you in your attempt to
steal the vaccine for us.</i>

1200
01:14:59,900 --> 01:15:01,710
Laughter vaccine.

1201
01:15:01,710 --> 01:15:04,380
[The pink fluid is the laughter vaccine.]

1202
01:15:04,390 --> 01:15:07,180
And the green fluid is the rage virus.

1203
01:15:07,180 --> 01:15:08,260
[The green fluid is the rage virus.]

1204
01:15:08,260 --> 01:15:10,840
<i>In order to ensure that you can safely
get the laughter vaccine to us</i>

1205
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:15,170
<i>infect all the members with the rage virus
provided and have them quarantined.</i>

1206
01:15:15,940 --> 01:15:19,810
<i>If you use the water gun to shoot the
virus strain on the opponent's name tag</i>

1207
01:15:19,810 --> 01:15:21,090
<i>you will succeed in infecting them.</i>

1208
01:15:21,090 --> 01:15:22,790
[Spray the name tag with the virus,
and the person will be infected!]

1209
01:15:24,330 --> 01:15:33,270
[Mr. Capable and Big-nose getting infected...
were both works of Blank Ji!]

1210
01:15:33,270 --> 01:15:35,070
- I didn't do anything!
- You did something, didn't you?

1211
01:15:36,150 --> 01:15:37,530
All I was doing was following behind you.

1212
01:15:37,540 --> 01:15:38,890
- Really?
- Really. I didn't do anything.

1213
01:15:39,780 --> 01:15:41,170
[I'm sorry, Suk Jin.]

1214
01:15:42,920 --> 01:15:44,430
<i>But one thing to remember.</i>

1215
01:15:44,430 --> 01:15:47,810
<i>Who is the one person you think of
when green fluid is mentioned?</i>

1216
01:15:47,810 --> 01:15:50,240
<i>That's none other than
Yoo-ames Bond!</i>

1217
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:57,940
<i>If you frame Yoo Jae Suk,
it'll be easier for you to infect others.</i>

1218
01:15:58,980 --> 01:16:02,710
- It's not me.
- But Jae Suk, you're Yoo-ames Bond...

1219
01:16:02,710 --> 01:16:04,300
- Is it time for part three?
- Ji Hyo...

1220
01:16:04,300 --> 01:16:07,340
- Yoo-ames Bond is not that kind of a man!
- What kind of a man is he?

1221
01:16:07,340 --> 01:16:11,950
Yoo-ames Bond doesn't resort to infecting
people with his water gun like that!

1222
01:16:11,950 --> 01:16:13,480
He doesn't resort to
filthy tricks like that!

1223
01:16:14,320 --> 01:16:17,880
I wasn't going to say this because
I didn't want anyone to suspect me...

1224
01:16:17,880 --> 01:16:21,610
[Certainly an actress! With tight acting,
works to frame Jae Suk for her actions!]

1225
01:16:22,900 --> 01:16:28,450
[Ha Ha fell for it hook, line, and sinker.]

1226
01:16:28,450 --> 01:16:30,620
You really are one scary woman.

1227
01:16:30,620 --> 01:16:32,580
That was sometime last April.

1228
01:16:34,690 --> 01:16:37,990
<i>If you either refuse this mission,
or fail to carry it out...</i>

1229
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,860
<i>you will immediately be infected
by the rage virus.</i>

1230
01:16:40,860 --> 01:16:44,260
<i>So make sure to find the vaccine,
and hand it over to us.</i>

1231
01:16:45,500 --> 01:16:50,380
[This is how Blank Ji had no choice
but to accept her mission.]

1232
01:16:50,910 --> 01:16:52,300
Jae Suk...

1233
01:16:53,600 --> 01:16:54,900
I'm sorry for what's about to
happen today.

1234
01:16:54,900 --> 01:16:58,270
I think you're going to have to
take the fall for me today.

1235
01:16:59,200 --> 01:17:01,680
Let's do this.

1236
01:17:04,480 --> 01:17:08,290
[And as soon as Ha Ha started suspecting
her, she infects him immediately!]

1237
01:17:12,830 --> 01:17:16,740
[I'm the real culprit of the day!]

1238
01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:24,850
<i>Intruder Ha Ha is infected!
Quarantine measures to be taken!</i>

1239
01:17:24,850 --> 01:17:29,980
[That means... Ha Ha isn't the culprit?]

1240
01:17:29,980 --> 01:17:33,810
[Then that means?]

1241
01:17:56,700 --> 01:18:00,740
[Gary - Out!]

1242
01:18:02,190 --> 01:18:03,380
Wait!

1243
01:18:04,710 --> 01:18:07,270
I knew this was going to happen!

1244
01:18:10,830 --> 01:18:12,960
Song Ji Hyo and Gary.
It's Song Ji Hyo and Gary.

1245
01:18:12,960 --> 01:18:14,480
Song Ji Hyo and Gary.

1246
01:18:15,150 --> 01:18:20,140
[Having ousted Gary from having thought
of the Monday Couple to be the culprits!]

1247
01:18:20,620 --> 01:18:27,010
[Jae Suk having been brought down by the
Monday Couple during the zombie episode.]

1248
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:31,030
Those two... framing me like that...

1249
01:18:32,480 --> 01:18:34,260
They almost had me fooled!

1250
01:18:35,850 --> 01:18:40,710
[But all these events were
the work of Ji Hyo alone!]

1251
01:18:42,180 --> 01:18:45,630
[Real culprit Ji Hyo,
casually taking a look around.]

1252
01:18:45,630 --> 01:18:46,890
I need to find Yoo Jae Suk.

1253
01:18:48,220 --> 01:18:50,900
[Spots Yoo-ames Bond!]

1254
01:19:02,630 --> 01:19:03,650
Come in.
Come in here.

1255
01:19:03,650 --> 01:19:05,020
Come in here.

1256
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:27,110
[A real final battle with each of them
with a water gun of their own.]

1257
01:19:42,980 --> 01:19:45,540
[She's here...]

1258
01:19:54,390 --> 01:19:59,410
[The distance is starting to close in...]

1259
01:20:07,500 --> 01:20:09,930
[Ji Hyo, stepping out...]

1260
01:20:11,800 --> 01:20:15,960
[Now!]

1261
01:20:27,350 --> 01:20:30,140
[Yoo-ames Bond shoots first!]

1262
01:20:30,310 --> 01:20:32,920
[Has Ji Hyo's name tag been marked?]

1263
01:20:32,930 --> 01:20:35,780
[Bulls-eye]

1264
01:20:35,780 --> 01:20:37,500
- Why?
- Check her name tag.

1265
01:20:37,500 --> 01:20:43,650
[Finally... the real culprit,
Song Ji Hyo is ousted!]

1266
01:20:44,640 --> 01:20:46,750
Song Ji Hyo, Kang Gary,
do you think I'm dumb?

1267
01:20:46,750 --> 01:20:48,000
Huh?

1268
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,830
- Song Ji Hyo, Kang Gary!
- Kang Gary isn't a part of it!

1269
01:20:50,830 --> 01:20:52,260
- What did you say?
- It was me by myself!

1270
01:20:52,260 --> 01:20:55,350
Hey, I thought it was Ha Ha
in the beginning.

1271
01:20:55,360 --> 01:20:57,330
But after thinking about it...

1272
01:20:57,340 --> 01:21:01,450
When we did the zombie special,
it was you and Kang Gary!

1273
01:21:02,760 --> 01:21:05,400
- I seriously...
- There's the vaccine.

1274
01:21:05,400 --> 01:21:07,940
[Yoo-ames Bond gets the
laughter vaccine in his possession!]

1275
01:21:08,780 --> 01:21:13,070
Seriously... Kang Gary isn't in on this.
He doesn't know anything.

1276
01:21:13,070 --> 01:21:14,990
He really doesn't know?
He wasn't in on it?

1277
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:19,940
You think you can just take the cake
after I put in all the work?

1278
01:21:20,730 --> 01:21:22,270
Seriously...

1279
01:21:22,270 --> 01:21:23,790
Really? It was just you?

1280
01:21:24,450 --> 01:21:28,080
Then Ha Ha and Gary weren't anything?
I feel really bad towards Gary now.

1281
01:21:33,750 --> 01:21:39,580
[Yoo-ames Bond succeeds in finding the
laughter back for all of mankind.]

1282
01:21:41,990 --> 01:21:44,180
I'm grateful to be able to return
laughter back to mankind.

1283
01:21:44,860 --> 01:21:46,830
Even though I didn't really know
what I was doing...

1284
01:21:47,780 --> 01:21:49,750
I just happened to come across it...

1285
01:21:50,670 --> 01:21:52,810
But I somehow did it.
What's that?

1286
01:21:53,600 --> 01:21:55,080
Why are you giving that to me?

1287
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:13,110
[Yoo-ames Bond... Never Die.]

1288
01:22:14,720 --> 01:22:17,480
[And thus...]

1289
01:22:17,480 --> 01:22:21,700
[With Yoo-ames Bond's unintentional
accomplishment...]

1290
01:22:21,710 --> 01:22:24,340
[Humanity was able to rid
themselves of their rage...]

1291
01:22:24,340 --> 01:22:30,310
[and find their way back to laughter.]

1292
01:22:31,170 --> 01:22:36,130
[And Running Man members got to
keep their jobs.]
