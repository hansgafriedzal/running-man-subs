[Hot as his name states, Lee Kyung Gyu.]

00:00:08,478 --> 00:00:12,028
[And the two actors challenging variety-
Kim In Gwon and Ryu Hyun Kyung.]

[Bringing tons of laughter to the show
with unpredictable energy.]

5
00:00:16,924 --> 00:00:18,790
[Sleek image of the big brother
kept hidden all this time until now.]

6
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:20,861
[And the long awaited psychic karaoke room.]

7

[One fine day in April-
'D' shopping mall.]

12
00:00:37,913 --> 00:00:40,472
[Waiting for Running Man members
at that location...]

13
00:00:40,473 --> 00:00:43,401
[One mysterious man...]

<i>[Do they know what time it is?]</i>

15
00:00:49,874 --> 00:00:51,082
<i>Producer?</i>

16
00:00:52,857 --> 00:00:54,260
Sir!

17
00:00:54,834 --> 00:00:58,147
[The big brother of the variety world-
Lee Kyung Gyu.]

18
00:00:59,164 --> 00:01:01,662
- Hello!
- There you are!

19
00:01:01,663 --> 00:01:04,643
[Shocked from seeing a face
he could've never guessed seeing.]

20
00:01:04,644 --> 00:01:07,124
We're going to get to
go home early!

21
00:01:08,776 --> 00:01:10,063
Run, run!

22
00:01:10,561 --> 00:01:11,960
Hurry up and run!

23
00:01:13,105 --> 00:01:14,837
- It's Kyung Gyu!
- Hurry!

24
00:01:15,732 --> 00:01:18,117
[Running up to greet his big brother.]

25
00:01:18,117 --> 00:01:21,656
[The two giants of the variety world's
surprising meeting outdoors.]

26
00:01:21,657 --> 00:01:23,198
- Hurry! Hurry!
- What are you doing here?

27
00:01:23,199 --> 00:01:26,293
- Who's next?
- Hurry up!

28
00:01:26,294 --> 00:01:28,147
- Tell them to hurry!
- Ha Ha...

29
00:01:28,148 --> 00:01:31,233
- Tell them all to come out together.
- Everyone together!

30
00:01:31,234 --> 00:01:33,521
- Tell them to come!
- Why are you coming out one by one?

31
00:01:33,522 --> 00:01:35,855
Tell everyone to come out now,
and let's get this over with.

32
00:01:35,856 --> 00:01:39,028
Tell them to come quickly.
Run, run!

33
00:01:39,029 --> 00:01:40,508
- Hurry up!
- Run!

34
00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:43,292
[Grabs the megaphone.]

35
00:01:45,163 --> 00:01:46,180
Hello, Sir!

36
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:48,633
[Increasing their pace to lightning speed.]

37
00:01:48,765 --> 00:01:50,544
- Jong Kook!
- It's an honor!

38
00:01:52,262 --> 00:01:54,184
- Suk Jin.
- Suk Jin...

39
00:01:54,185 --> 00:01:56,545
- Hurry up and get up here.
- We don't have much time!

40
00:01:56,546 --> 00:01:59,332
- Hurry up, Gary!
- Hello, fighting champion!

41
00:01:59,333 --> 00:02:01,800
Sir, my name is Kang Gary,
also known as the fighting champion!

42
00:02:02,991 --> 00:02:05,059
Stop doing stupid things,
and come over here.

43
00:02:05,902 --> 00:02:08,797
Suk Jin, Kyung Gyu hates
things like that.

44
00:02:08,798 --> 00:02:12,163
[Even the oldest on the show, Big-nose,
remains humble in front of Kyung Gyu.]

45
00:02:12,881 --> 00:02:16,290
- Ji Hyo!
- Hurry it up! Run faster!

46
00:02:19,007 --> 00:02:20,863
- Hello.
- Hello.

47
00:02:21,573 --> 00:02:24,865
I don't know if you're all aware of this,
but Lee Kyung Gyu...

48
00:02:24,866 --> 00:02:27,473
he's the icon of love and consideration.

49
00:02:27,474 --> 00:02:31,262
He really is a titan in the land of variety.

50
00:02:31,263 --> 00:02:32,895
[A titan in the
Korean variety show industry.]

51
00:02:32,896 --> 00:02:36,940
He's like a father to us whom we all
respect and love in our hearts.

52
00:02:36,941 --> 00:02:38,624
Lee Kyung Gyu has joined
our show today!

53
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:42,004
[Eternal big brother of variety land,
Lee Kyung Gyu!]

54
00:02:42,005 --> 00:02:43,877
We can't leave out his name when
it comes to variety shows.

55
00:02:43,878 --> 00:02:46,929
With truly pure intentions...

56
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:48,262
- With truly pure intentions...
- Yes?

57
00:02:48,263 --> 00:02:50,279
I have come on the show today
for the sake of Running Man.

58
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,242
- I have no other intentions.
- Why are you all laughing?

59
00:02:52,856 --> 00:02:57,006
[Did he really come on the show with the
sole intention of Running Man's benefit?]

60
00:02:57,814 --> 00:02:59,769
While on the show...

61
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:02,047
don't you think that I should at least
be able to beat this guy?

62
00:03:02,808 --> 00:03:04,008
I really think I can handle him.

63
00:03:04,009 --> 00:03:07,016
For the first time in a long while, a truly
worth adversary has joined us today.

64
00:03:07,017 --> 00:03:08,919
[A worthy adversary for
the Big-nosed Brother?]

65
00:03:09,834 --> 00:03:12,640
I can take you out as easily as
snuffing out a candle.

66
00:03:13,161 --> 00:03:15,496
I see that you're wearing
tennis shoes today.

67
00:03:15,953 --> 00:03:17,232
Look at those shoes you're wearing.

68
00:03:17,233 --> 00:03:19,777
[Truly seems determined today...]

69
00:03:20,718 --> 00:03:21,976
I wore them since I'm making
an appearance on Running Man.

70
00:03:21,977 --> 00:03:23,257
But I think this is...

71
00:03:23,258 --> 00:03:27,471
the first time I've done an SBS Sunday
variety show with Kyung Gyu.

72
00:03:27,472 --> 00:03:28,618
- You're right.
- Isn't it?

73
00:03:28,619 --> 00:03:30,288
This is my first time appearing on
an SBS weekend variety show.

74
00:03:30,289 --> 00:03:32,473
This really is your first time.
And when it comes to Lee Kyung Gyu...

75
00:03:32,474 --> 00:03:37,018
he really likes to listen in on
his juniors talking.

76
00:03:37,019 --> 00:03:38,476
But useless conversations...

77
00:03:39,212 --> 00:03:40,954
and anything that's not very
interesting...

78
00:03:40,955 --> 00:03:43,502
If that's what you're going to talk about,
it's better not to talk at all in his opinion.

79
00:03:43,503 --> 00:03:45,257
[Don't even think about things like that...]

80
00:03:45,258 --> 00:03:47,080
If it's not funny,
I don't react to it at all.

81
00:03:48,115 --> 00:03:51,699
[Big-brother's cut throat reaction.]

82
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:55,480
Even though we've been hearing this often,
you are the icon of consideration...

83
00:03:55,481 --> 00:03:57,260
and you are also known as
the icon of love.

84
00:03:57,261 --> 00:04:00,509
What is it that we'll be doing with
our iconic brother, Lee Kyung Gyu today?

85
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:01,994
How are the teams going
to be split up?

86
00:04:01,995 --> 00:04:04,315
<i>Senior Kyung Gyu...
do you have anything you'd like to say?</i>

87
00:04:04,316 --> 00:04:05,833
- Anything you'd like to say?
- Me?

88
00:04:05,834 --> 00:04:07,939
Well, you know, I...

89
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:11,097
[Huh? Did he forget something?]

90
00:04:11,098 --> 00:04:12,996
- This is your first time on our show.
- Running Man is...

91
00:04:12,997 --> 00:04:15,277
- What would you like to say?
- Running Man is...

92
00:04:15,278 --> 00:04:18,062
Running Man has always been
one of my favorite shows...

93
00:04:18,063 --> 00:04:21,499
- I will do my best on the show today.
- Of course!

94
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:25,008
[To say such nice things like that...]

95
00:04:25,009 --> 00:04:26,990
- What nice words!
- But...

96
00:04:26,991 --> 00:04:29,542
- What about the teams?
- We have to divide up the teams...

97
00:04:29,542 --> 00:04:31,813
How should we divide up the teams?
Are we evenly numbered?

98
00:04:31,814 --> 00:04:33,575
- I think there's an even number of members.
- Two, four...

99
00:04:33,576 --> 00:04:34,874
- Eight people.
- Perfectly numbered.

100
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:36,965
Don't you think that there should be
at least ten people?

101
00:04:38,101 --> 00:04:39,960
Did you bring some people
on the show with you today?

102
00:04:39,961 --> 00:04:42,144
- Who did you bring?
- Kyung Gyu, who did you bring with you?

103
00:04:42,145 --> 00:04:43,893
Did you bring someone with you?

104
00:04:44,485 --> 00:04:46,812
- What?
- Did you bring others with you?

105
00:04:47,171 --> 00:04:49,161
Did you bring some other
actors on the show with you?

106
00:04:49,162 --> 00:04:51,026
You're not here for us?

107
00:04:51,509 --> 00:04:54,221
If we were to do the show
with some other actors...

108
00:04:54,222 --> 00:04:56,512
If we were to do the show with them,
wouldn't it be livelier?

109
00:04:56,513 --> 00:04:58,048
Of course, as long as it's fun,
it'll be great.

110
00:04:58,049 --> 00:05:01,673
- That's why I brought two actors with me.
- Who are they?

111
00:05:02,564 --> 00:05:04,367
Ryu Hyun Kyung and...

112
00:05:05,964 --> 00:05:08,826
- Kim In Gwon.
- Ryu Hyun Kyung and Kim In Gwon!

113
00:05:08,827 --> 00:05:12,304
[Because you need at least
ten people on the show?]

114
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:15,987
[Kim In Gwon and Ryu Hyun Kyung.]

115
00:05:20,981 --> 00:05:26,155
[Along with these two who are often seen on
the variety circuit with the Big-brother...]

116
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:29,137
- In Gwon...
- Hello.

117
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:34,581
[Everyone already looks
pretty chummy together?]

118
00:05:34,582 --> 00:05:38,566
[The two stars of a new movie that
Lee Kyung Gyu is producing at the moment.]

119
00:05:38,567 --> 00:05:40,835
Please welcome these two
on the show today.

120
00:05:40,836 --> 00:05:42,596
[Kim In Gwon and Ryu Hyun Kyung
also joining the show today.]

121
00:05:42,849 --> 00:05:45,340
- We all know each other then?
- Of course, we all know each other.

122
00:05:45,341 --> 00:05:47,903
- Then it's a good thing we came.
- This is really...

123
00:05:48,715 --> 00:05:51,491
- I was afraid you wouldn't know each other.
- We all know each other.

124
00:05:51,492 --> 00:05:54,465
Seriously though,
how many years has it been?

125
00:05:54,466 --> 00:05:55,814
It's been about five to six years.

126
00:05:55,815 --> 00:05:58,319
[The first movie he's produced
in about five to six years.]

127
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,940
I feel a little embarrassed to be
discussing my movie

128
00:06:00,941 --> 00:06:02,469
so let's not talk about it.

129
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:04,682
No, you should keep talking about it
since you're on the show today.

130
00:06:05,209 --> 00:06:08,239
But the way he said that...
it sounds like he was mocking me.

131
00:06:09,213 --> 00:06:12,439
When it was just me earlier,
I didn't feel so bashful.

132
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:15,490
But now that these two are out here too,
I feel like I'm just here promoting the movie.

133
00:06:16,465 --> 00:06:18,042
You think?

134
00:06:18,043 --> 00:06:21,331
[Is the Big-brother really here
just for the sole benefit of Running Man?]

135
00:06:21,332 --> 00:06:24,103
<i>I will announce the teams for the day.</i>

136
00:06:24,104 --> 00:06:26,971
- We're going to be divided into two teams.
- Are we done talking about the movie now?

137
00:06:28,569 --> 00:06:30,567
- You have something else to say?
- We still have a lot of time left today.

138
00:06:30,567 --> 00:06:32,266
[Is he disappointed?]

139
00:06:32,412 --> 00:06:34,807
So... how are we dividing up the teams?

140
00:06:34,808 --> 00:06:37,276
- The first team is... Lee Kyung Gyu...
- Yes?

141
00:06:37,277 --> 00:06:38,944
- Yoo Jae Suk...
- Yes?

142
00:06:38,945 --> 00:06:43,365
<i>Ji Suk Jin, Song Ji Hyo, and
Lee Kwang Soo makes up one team.</i>

143
00:06:43,366 --> 00:06:45,124
[Lee Kyung Gyu, Yoo Jae Suk, Ji Suk Jin,
Song Ji Hyo and Lee Kwang Soo.]

144
00:06:45,512 --> 00:06:49,946
[And Jong Kook, In Gwon, Hyun Kyung,
Gary and Ha Ha.]

145
00:06:49,947 --> 00:06:52,852
Then what are you saying? Are you
saying that we're not young blood?

146
00:06:53,266 --> 00:06:55,249
We're young blood over here too.

147
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:56,499
[Significantly younger team.]

148
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:59,335
- By a stroke of luck today...
- Stroke of luck...

149
00:06:59,336 --> 00:07:01,568
<i>Our race today is,
Running Man Singing Race.</i>

150
00:07:01,569 --> 00:07:03,464
[Running Man Singing Race.]

151
00:07:03,465 --> 00:07:06,383
<i>Every time you pass a mission that will
be taking place in multiple locations...</i>

152
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:08,904
<i>You will gain coins for a karaoke room.</i>

153
00:07:09,368 --> 00:07:13,182
<i>You will use those coins to challenge each
other at the final karaoke competition</i>

154
00:07:13,183 --> 00:07:15,775
<i>and the team with the highest score will
become the ultimate winner.</i>

155
00:07:15,776 --> 00:07:17,381
<i>Today's rules are very simple.</i>

156
00:07:18,276 --> 00:07:20,258
- Look at how happy Kyung Gyu looks.
- He looks so happy.

157
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:23,419
- Does he like the race described?
- Yes, he really like things like that.

158
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:26,406
[Seems extremely satisfied with
today's concept...]

159
00:07:28,912 --> 00:07:31,263
[Singing Race- Start!]

160
00:07:31,264 --> 00:07:33,679
We're heading off to the
sauna, Kyung Gyu.

161
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,561
[On their way to the first location-
Sauna.]

162
00:07:35,562 --> 00:07:37,419
I wonder what we're going to do there?

163
00:07:37,743 --> 00:07:39,657
Thank you.
Have a good day.

164
00:07:41,104 --> 00:07:43,970
- Jong Kook has become so much more caring.
- Really?

165
00:07:44,778 --> 00:07:47,376
I have noticed that he's become
much more caring than he used to be.

166
00:07:49,097 --> 00:07:51,129
But if you mess up, it's over for you.

167
00:07:53,715 --> 00:07:58,878
[A formidable ally if on the same team,
but impregnable if on opposing sides.]

168
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:01,039
I know that Ji Hyo was up all night
shooting her new drama yesterday.

169
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:04,538
[Blank Ji with her busy schedule lately.]

170
00:08:04,539 --> 00:08:06,529
- Her cheeks are...
- There's no life to them.

171
00:08:06,529 --> 00:08:08,074
[What is he saying?]

172
00:08:08,598 --> 00:08:10,387
- I think I'm starting to really age.
- Why?

173
00:08:10,388 --> 00:08:12,465
My dark circles are getting worse.

174
00:08:12,466 --> 00:08:16,092
- You can't fool time.
- Hey! Why do you keep saying all that?

175
00:08:16,092 --> 00:08:17,749
- Kwang Soo...
- Yes?

176
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,795
I'm going to be 60 years old
any day now.

177
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:21,866
I'm sorry.

178
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:25,627
Kyung Gyu even remembers you
by name, Kwang Soo.

179
00:08:25,628 --> 00:08:29,335
- You should know that's an honor.
- I've seen Kwang Soo in movies...

180
00:08:29,924 --> 00:08:33,131
I know that Kwang Soo is extremely
popular in Thailand and Vietnam.

181
00:08:33,132 --> 00:08:36,490
[He even knows of his
popularity overseas?]

182
00:08:36,491 --> 00:08:38,874
I memorized the few basics before
I came on the show today.

183
00:08:39,402 --> 00:08:42,779
[This is the mentality of a variety titan.]

184
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:45,204
What were you like in the past, Kyung Gyu?

185
00:08:45,205 --> 00:08:47,481
Ugh... I wasn't the scary person
as everyone seems to think.

186
00:08:47,482 --> 00:08:49,348
- I've heard a lot of rumors.
- The rumors were wrong.

187
00:08:49,349 --> 00:08:52,276
- That's what I thought.
- That false rumor spread like wild fire.

188
00:08:52,277 --> 00:08:54,685
Rumors really can't be taken lightly,
you know that, right?

189
00:08:56,257 --> 00:09:01,258
Are there any misunderstandings that
you'd like to clear up for us right now?

190
00:09:01,259 --> 00:09:03,670
Here's one.
Rumor about me biting the writers.

191
00:09:03,671 --> 00:09:05,553
[Misunderstanding I-
'Making the writers cry every day.']

192
00:09:05,553 --> 00:09:07,682
The writers I work with these days...
they cry when we have to part ways.

193
00:09:07,683 --> 00:09:09,959
Because they're so upset that I'm leaving.

194
00:09:10,314 --> 00:09:12,157
[A knowing laugh?]

195
00:09:13,278 --> 00:09:15,177
They're so disappointed to
part ways with me.

196
00:09:15,178 --> 00:09:17,903
- That's how things are lately.
- I see, I see.

197
00:09:17,904 --> 00:09:20,498
Back in the day, if I was to
come walking down the hallway...

198
00:09:20,499 --> 00:09:23,378
like the parting of the Red Sea,
all the writers...

199
00:09:23,379 --> 00:09:25,481
they'd all split down the middle,
and stick themselves to the wall.

200
00:09:25,482 --> 00:09:27,430
[The writers would line themselves
up against the wall?]

201
00:09:27,431 --> 00:09:30,621
- I heard they threw salt at you?
- What are you talking about?

202
00:09:31,155 --> 00:09:32,641
- Kwang Soo...
- Yes?

203
00:09:32,838 --> 00:09:35,070
That bit about the salt wasn't right.

204
00:09:35,933 --> 00:09:40,480
I know that there were some rumors,
but I've never been pelted by any salt.

205
00:09:41,573 --> 00:09:44,627
But you've always...
been very good to me.

206
00:09:44,628 --> 00:09:46,654
- I think you've always been good to me.
- Of course, I was.

207
00:09:46,655 --> 00:09:50,860
- I try to be good to my juniors.
- You were always very good to me.

208
00:09:51,271 --> 00:09:53,291
There are a few people
that I don't like though.

209
00:09:57,470 --> 00:09:59,172
I wonder how Park Myung Soo is doing?

210
00:09:59,577 --> 00:10:03,715
[Mr. Park Myung Soo...
he's asking how you're doing?]

211
00:10:04,689 --> 00:10:06,783
- Kyung Gyu, we're here.
- We're here?

212
00:10:06,784 --> 00:10:09,313
[Arrives at the mission location.]

213
00:10:10,641 --> 00:10:12,648
['S' Waterpark in Youngdeungpyo.]

214
00:10:12,649 --> 00:10:17,102
<i>Your first race is three step sauna race
to win the coins.</i>

215
00:10:17,103 --> 00:10:20,495
<i>You will be playing a total of three games
with common items that you see at a sauna.</i>

216
00:10:20,496 --> 00:10:24,206
[Common items seen at a sauna-
Exfoliating towel, egg and fork.]

217
00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:27,536
<i>Neither age nor physique
will have any bearing on these games.</i>

218
00:10:27,537 --> 00:10:32,413
In Gwon used to be on a variety program
with us a long time ago.

219
00:10:32,414 --> 00:10:36,165
That variety program used to be
pretty popular back in the day.

220
00:10:36,166 --> 00:10:39,886
And the first person to get eliminated
during those games was always In Gwon.

221
00:10:39,887 --> 00:10:41,897
[Was always the first to get eliminated
during the games.]

222
00:10:41,897 --> 00:10:45,203
[The image he acquired during the days
of the old program still remains with him.]

223
00:10:45,204 --> 00:10:47,579
He used to have a certain role that
he personified back then.

224
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:49,851
He used to be like Kwang Soo
back in those days.

225
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:54,676
He never got to show us his full potential
because he was the first to be eliminated.

226
00:10:54,677 --> 00:10:57,190
- Jae Suk tried to save him...
- Yes, he did try to save me.

227
00:10:57,191 --> 00:10:59,918
When he used to make In Gwon sing for
a chance to be saved from elimination

228
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:01,595
he would sing the song,
'The morning mist'.

229
00:11:01,596 --> 00:11:03,922
[The song he chose to sing was,
'The morning mist'.]

230
00:11:03,923 --> 00:11:06,402
[Even though it's a nice song,
I bet it wasn't very appropriate?]

231
00:11:06,403 --> 00:11:08,369
I really thought that he had
lost his mind.

232
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:16,484
- I thought he'd sing a bright and happy song.
- I thought that too!

233
00:11:16,485 --> 00:11:18,366
Even though that song is a very nice song...

234
00:11:18,367 --> 00:11:19,857
Any other person would sing something
happy and cheerful.

235
00:11:19,858 --> 00:11:21,985
He should've sang a happy song,
but the song he sang was depressing.

236
00:11:21,986 --> 00:11:24,286
- Tell us something about Hyun Kyung now.
- Hyun Kyung?

237
00:11:24,708 --> 00:11:27,725
- Hyun Kyung is...
- She's the female Gary!

238
00:11:27,726 --> 00:11:29,544
- You're right!
- She really is the female Gary.

239
00:11:29,545 --> 00:11:32,071
- I heard you two are close?
- She's the queen of festivals.

240
00:11:32,072 --> 00:11:35,757
[Queen of festivals?]

241
00:11:35,758 --> 00:11:37,810
[Specializes in livening up
the club scene?]

242
00:11:37,811 --> 00:11:39,954
You know when most women dances
a sexy wave dance?

243
00:11:39,955 --> 00:11:42,069
She'd be dancing
a hip hop dance instead.

244
00:11:42,345 --> 00:11:46,022
[We may be able to verify that later...]

245
00:11:46,023 --> 00:11:48,472
I really can't stand seeing women
dancing like that.

246
00:11:49,447 --> 00:11:52,297
[Spitting out venomous words
as if he's been waiting for the moment.]

247
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:55,074
Let's just get on with the games.

248
00:11:55,956 --> 00:11:57,892
Have we been talking too much?

249
00:11:57,893 --> 00:11:59,993
<i>Since the Orange Team was
the first to arrive</i>

250
00:11:59,994 --> 00:12:03,562
<i>they can pick one of the items first,
and we will start off with that game.</i>

251
00:12:05,732 --> 00:12:07,332
- How about the exfoliating towel?
- Exfoliating towel?

252
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:09,689
- Okay, the exfoliating towel.
- Exfoliating towel.

253
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:11,164
What's the exfoliating towel game?

254
00:12:11,537 --> 00:12:15,584
[The exfoliating towel game is...]

255
00:12:15,585 --> 00:12:16,769
Is it the tug-of-war game?

256
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:19,621
The game we'll be playing with the
towel is the wrestling game.

257
00:12:19,622 --> 00:12:22,008
[Exfoliating towel wrestling game.]

258
00:12:22,828 --> 00:12:25,994
<i>Wrap the towel around the waist
and pull your opponent</i>

259
00:12:25,994 --> 00:12:28,687
<i>and the team to lose their footing first
loses the game.</i>

260
00:12:28,858 --> 00:12:32,707
- From our team... In Gwon will start.
- Okay, let's start with In Gwon.

261
00:12:32,708 --> 00:12:34,902
- In Gwon!
- In Gwon!

262
00:12:35,973 --> 00:12:37,939
- Then as for us...
- I'll start.

263
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:39,482
[Big-nosed Brother will start off
from the Orange Team.]

264
00:12:40,996 --> 00:12:43,054
Do you know how to play this?
Have you played this before?

265
00:12:43,055 --> 00:12:44,279
- This way?
- Have you played it before?

266
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,978
- You have to wrap it the other way.
- The other way?

267
00:12:45,979 --> 00:12:48,218
- Seriously...
- In Gwon, In Gwon!

268
00:12:48,219 --> 00:12:50,548
- Is this too short?
- What are you doing?

269
00:12:50,549 --> 00:12:52,799
- In Gwon, In Gwon!
- This isn't right, is it?

270
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,812
You're not doing this right, Suk Jin.

271
00:12:54,813 --> 00:12:57,061
[Coach Kook unable to withstand it any
longer, and steps in to interfere.]

272
00:12:57,062 --> 00:12:59,872
You have to put your foot our like this.
Turn this foot around.

273
00:12:59,873 --> 00:13:01,720
- What?
- In Gwon! Turn your foot around!

274
00:13:02,209 --> 00:13:04,043
- Like this!
- Ah, like this?

275
00:13:05,267 --> 00:13:07,065
If you do it like that,
Suk Jin's face won't show on screen.

276
00:13:07,066 --> 00:13:08,850
- What are you doing?
- What?

277
00:13:08,851 --> 00:13:10,564
[Ah...]

278
00:13:10,565 --> 00:13:13,341
- That's how you're supposed to stand!
- Just turn your face around like this.

279
00:13:15,015 --> 00:13:16,784
What if he's eliminated during his first try?

280
00:13:16,785 --> 00:13:19,686
- If one of your foot drops...
- No, when both of my feet drops.

281
00:13:19,687 --> 00:13:21,851
[Are they still trying to
figure out the rules?]

282
00:13:21,852 --> 00:13:24,161
You're the culprit who's always
dragging out the filming, aren't you?

283
00:13:25,493 --> 00:13:27,430
I can't help it that I'm in good shape.

284
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:29,283
You talk so much!

285
00:13:29,284 --> 00:13:30,512
He's always talking nonstop.

286
00:13:30,513 --> 00:13:33,703
[Tiger's chatter grating on
Big-brother's nerves.]

287
00:13:33,704 --> 00:13:36,342
- His chatter...
- I'm sorry, I'll keep it short.

288
00:13:36,343 --> 00:13:39,706
- Isn't this how we're supposed to do it?
- That's not how you're supposed to do it!

289
00:13:40,681 --> 00:13:42,736
[Big-brother explodes.]

290
00:13:45,551 --> 00:13:46,952
Don't even play it!

291
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:49,645
Why do you talk so much?

292
00:13:49,646 --> 00:13:51,533
Just do it!

293
00:13:53,973 --> 00:13:55,685
- Okay.
- Here we go.

294
00:13:55,686 --> 00:13:56,820
In Gwon...

295
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:58,736
I'm not going easy on you, okay?

296
00:14:00,236 --> 00:14:02,539
Ready... set, go!

297
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:04,063
[Start]

298
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:08,084
[One move, and he loses.]

299
00:14:09,797 --> 00:14:13,724
[Takes ten minutes to prepare for the game,
and In Gwon wins in less than one second.]

300
00:14:13,725 --> 00:14:15,415
- In Gwon!
- In Gwon wins!

301
00:14:15,416 --> 00:14:16,692
- In Gwon!
- In Gwon!

302
00:14:16,693 --> 00:14:19,616
[Getting more weaker and
useless by the day.]

303
00:14:20,045 --> 00:14:21,350
He's good.

304
00:14:21,351 --> 00:14:22,407
You stand over here.

305
00:14:22,408 --> 00:14:25,461
[Kyung Gyu taking over the spot
where he'll be most visible.]

306
00:14:25,462 --> 00:14:27,535
[Knows how to utilize the camera...]

307
00:14:27,536 --> 00:14:29,850
That spot doesn't allow for
proper stance with your legs.

308
00:14:29,851 --> 00:14:31,228
His comedic sense truly is...

309
00:14:31,229 --> 00:14:33,285
His legs looks like a white person's legs.

310
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:35,410
[White as snow.]

311
00:14:35,411 --> 00:14:37,185
Like a white person's legs...
like a white woman's legs.

312
00:14:37,186 --> 00:14:39,011
How are his legs so white?

313
00:14:39,012 --> 00:14:40,946
[In Gwon vs. Kyung Gyu - Start.]

314
00:14:45,268 --> 00:14:47,979
[Quick hand moves!]

315
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:50,536
[You've still got it, Kyung Gyu...]

316
00:14:52,491 --> 00:14:54,600
- Didn't he used to do martial arts?
- You've still got it, Kyung Gyu!

317
00:14:54,601 --> 00:14:56,393
Kyung Gyu used to practice Kung Fu.

318
00:14:56,394 --> 00:14:58,544
You have to watch out for
In Gwon's moves.

319
00:14:58,545 --> 00:14:59,564
This move In Gwon does...

320
00:15:01,949 --> 00:15:05,032
[Big-brother's sudden power!]

321
00:15:06,217 --> 00:15:08,009
- How did he do that?
- Wow... how did that happen?

322
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:10,032
[See that?]

323
00:15:12,214 --> 00:15:15,245
[Seems as though his
martial arts skills aren't dead yet!]

324
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:17,887
- Next up is...
- You have to watch out for him.

325
00:15:17,888 --> 00:15:20,244
- Next up is... Ha Ha? How about Ha Ha?
- Hyun Kyung.

326
00:15:21,814 --> 00:15:24,037
[It seems as though he's targeting the two
people that he's feeling confident about.]

327
00:15:24,037 --> 00:15:27,222
Why can't I do that?
Why... why isn't she allowed?

328
00:15:27,223 --> 00:15:28,866
Are you making your pick?

329
00:15:28,867 --> 00:15:31,168
I'm on a roll here.

330
00:15:32,951 --> 00:15:35,476
[Kkuk taking the challenge.]

331
00:15:37,454 --> 00:15:39,170
- Okay, let's do this.
- Don't get nervous, Kyung Gyu.

332
00:15:40,177 --> 00:15:43,289
[Competition between strength
and experience?]

333
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:45,752
- This isn't about strength, but it's skills.
- But he already feels...

334
00:15:45,753 --> 00:15:47,305
Don't worry.

335
00:15:49,886 --> 00:15:51,544
They're finally going at it.

336
00:15:52,024 --> 00:15:54,352
The two who are angry 24-7...

337
00:15:54,353 --> 00:15:56,109
[A battle between two men who are
always constantly getting angry.]

338
00:15:56,109 --> 00:15:57,492
A battle of wills!

339
00:15:57,493 --> 00:16:00,309
I heard that he used to practice martial arts
and I can feel the difference.

340
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:01,987
[Feeling the difference in
Kyung Gyu's strength?]

341
00:16:01,988 --> 00:16:03,508
[Oh... even taking off his glasses?]

342
00:16:04,563 --> 00:16:07,294
- Can you see without your glasses?
- Don't take this so seriously!

343
00:16:07,295 --> 00:16:09,155
I want a spot on the show.

344
00:16:09,925 --> 00:16:12,238
[Ah... really?]

345
00:16:15,059 --> 00:16:19,730
You know what's coming, don't you?
Just concentrate on your singing career.

346
00:16:21,192 --> 00:16:24,373
[Big-brother's confidence about
getting his Sunday night variety spot back?]

347
00:16:24,374 --> 00:16:26,286
You're playing around too much.

348
00:16:26,287 --> 00:16:28,778
- You've been doing it for 7-8 years already.
- I'm sorry.

349
00:16:29,907 --> 00:16:31,195
- Shall I go?
- Go ahead.

350
00:16:37,027 --> 00:16:39,429
[The exfoliating towel not even budging.]

351
00:16:45,293 --> 00:16:47,088
<i>Is there a need to go this far?</i>

352
00:16:48,764 --> 00:16:50,333
He's doing really well.

353
00:16:50,334 --> 00:16:54,053
[His waist is staying alert
to stay in the game.]

354
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:56,036
He's good!
Look at the way he's playing!

355
00:16:56,037 --> 00:16:57,199
He's not joking around.

356
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:00,332
[I will show you all!]

357
00:17:01,451 --> 00:17:05,490
[Kyung Gyu enduring it with
a dignified stance.]

358
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:07,915
This isn't being played purely
with strength.

359
00:17:11,992 --> 00:17:14,144
[Jong Kook wins...]

360
00:17:17,062 --> 00:17:19,242
I thought you were showing us
a ballet move!

361
00:17:22,032 --> 00:17:25,971
[Like a swan taking a tragic fall...]

362
00:17:25,972 --> 00:17:29,634
[Both of his white legs falls out
of their stance and he loses...]

363
00:17:31,392 --> 00:17:33,325
I thought you were doing ballet!

364
00:17:34,128 --> 00:17:36,626
- Did you have to win that badly?
- Jong Kook, seriously...

365
00:17:37,725 --> 00:17:38,965
Kwang Soo!

366
00:17:38,966 --> 00:17:41,767
[Next up is a tiger attacking giraffe.]

367
00:17:41,768 --> 00:17:43,530
- Kwang Soo...
- Move over!

368
00:17:44,696 --> 00:17:46,503
Are we going to keep switching spots
back and forth like this?

369
00:17:46,504 --> 00:17:48,758
- Here.
- Your arms are much longer, Kwang Soo.

370
00:17:48,759 --> 00:17:50,504
Just hold it and stand still.
No, just let go for now.

371
00:17:50,505 --> 00:17:51,924
[Trying to make Kwang Soo suffer
as much as he had to take earlier?]

372
00:17:51,925 --> 00:17:53,631
[Just why...]

373
00:17:53,632 --> 00:17:55,369
Why does he have to grab it like that?

374
00:17:55,370 --> 00:17:57,202
Who says he has to grab it like that?

375
00:17:57,203 --> 00:18:00,636
- Why are you making him grab it like that?
- He should just grab it as I hand it to him.

376
00:18:01,327 --> 00:18:02,960
You've got a bad demeanor, don't you?

377
00:18:05,851 --> 00:18:07,170
Your right foot!

378
00:18:07,171 --> 00:18:09,530
[Keeps taking out his aggravations
out on Kwang Soo.]

379
00:18:09,531 --> 00:18:10,873
Let's move over to the middle.

380
00:18:11,343 --> 00:18:12,551
Ready...

381
00:18:12,924 --> 00:18:14,063
set, go!

382
00:18:16,651 --> 00:18:18,230
That's the way to do it, Kwang Soo.

383
00:18:21,432 --> 00:18:23,762
[Playing around leading him to defeat.]

384
00:18:23,763 --> 00:18:25,958
- This is how you play it?
- You have to pull back, Kwang Soo.

385
00:18:25,659 --> 00:18:27,392
Kwang Soo just told you
that you're hurting him.

386
00:18:28,114 --> 00:18:30,181
Your opponent is telling you
that you're hurting him!

387
00:18:30,182 --> 00:18:31,822
Seriously... it really hurts.

388
00:18:31,823 --> 00:18:33,288
How can you be so uncaring?

389
00:18:33,289 --> 00:18:35,979
Take a little break,
and I'll teach him a lesson.

390
00:18:38,202 --> 00:18:41,416
[Kyung Gyu's original image
is making a comeback.]

391
00:18:41,417 --> 00:18:43,517
- Finally, Lee Kyung Gyu is back!
- Lee Kyung Gyu!

392
00:18:43,518 --> 00:18:46,075
- Kyung Gyu is back!
- He just told you that he's hurting!

393
00:18:46,076 --> 00:18:47,656
- It really did hurt.
- Let's do it again.

394
00:18:47,657 --> 00:18:49,129
Are you his parent or something?

395
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:52,443
No one can stop him now.
If he says do it again, then do it again.

396
00:18:52,444 --> 00:18:55,052
[Restarting the competition.]

397
00:18:55,053 --> 00:18:56,165
Set, go!

398
00:18:58,625 --> 00:18:59,809
Not bad, you might have a chance.

399
00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:00,821
Kwang Soo...

400
00:19:01,493 --> 00:19:03,010
- It hurts.
- What are you doing?

401
00:19:03,011 --> 00:19:04,390
- It hurts.
- Huh?

402
00:19:04,391 --> 00:19:05,772
- It hurts.
- Just do it.

403
00:19:07,115 --> 00:19:09,917
[Second chances are up to
the Big-brother's discretion.]

404
00:19:11,586 --> 00:19:13,790
It feels like I'm tied up to a tree.

405
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:15,466
Kwang Soo, try pulling.

406
00:19:15,467 --> 00:19:17,865
Unravel it, and then pull it back.
There you go.

407
00:19:17,866 --> 00:19:19,217
Unravel it and pull it back.

408
00:19:22,453 --> 00:19:25,096
[Giraffe's crumble from having
believed in his Big-brother.]

409
00:19:27,272 --> 00:19:28,652
Are you okay?

410
00:19:28,653 --> 00:19:30,573
- Get back to the line.
- My ears are ringing.

411
00:19:32,212 --> 00:19:34,089
[Jong Kook wins.]

412
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:36,534
Maybe your inner ears are trying
to change the channel setting?

413
00:19:38,021 --> 00:19:40,459
[Exfoliating towel finalists:
Orange Team's Ji Hyo vs. Blue Team's Gary.]

414
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:42,413
- You again?
- Yeah, it's me!

415
00:19:43,469 --> 00:19:45,337
- You again?
- Come over this way.

416
00:19:45,338 --> 00:19:47,306
I'm not as strong as Jong Kook is.

417
00:19:47,307 --> 00:19:48,461
- That's true.
- Why are you saying that?

418
00:19:48,771 --> 00:19:50,604
I know that you're known to be
quite the fighter.

419
00:19:52,041 --> 00:19:53,695
I thought you said you were
a master in martial arts?

420
00:19:53,696 --> 00:19:57,098
- I thought that you said you were good?
- This is the highest I can even kick!

421
00:19:57,099 --> 00:19:59,204
- Then why did you tell us you were a master?
- How are you a master?

422
00:19:59,205 --> 00:20:00,913
[Kang Gary is rumored to be a
master of martial arts.]

423
00:20:00,914 --> 00:20:02,649
Third level. I have a third level belt
in the art of love.

424
00:20:04,196 --> 00:20:08,349
[He may not know about martial arts...
but a level three belt in the art of love?]

425
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:09,938
- He's at least a level three.
- Level three in love?

426
00:20:10,395 --> 00:20:12,028
Level three in love...

427
00:20:11,829 --> 00:20:13,092
- Ready?
- Ready!

428
00:20:13,093 --> 00:20:14,540
- How do I do this?
- Ready, set, go!

429
00:20:18,479 --> 00:20:20,297
Are we playing hard to get here?

430
00:20:20,939 --> 00:20:22,550
Is that what we're doing?

431
00:20:22,551 --> 00:20:26,193
[Level three Gary having changed the game
to a form of love foreplay.]

432

You guys are seriously...

433
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:33,527
[Is this a form of a hard-to-get scene that
one would see being played out at a club?]

434
00:20:35,393 --> 00:20:37,763
- That's nice.
- You guys do make a nice picture.

435
00:20:37,763 --> 00:20:39,690
These two seriously...

436
00:20:41,111 --> 00:20:42,625
I'm sorry, Ji Hyo.
I have no other choice.

437
00:20:46,408 --> 00:20:48,665
- She's pretty good.
- Ji Hyo's no easy target.

438
00:20:48,666 --> 00:20:51,124
- Is she putting up a good fight?
- Of course, she is.

[Blank Ji wins.]

- Did that really happen?
- I'm good at martial arts!

442
00:21:14,932 --> 00:21:17,849
- That was seriously...
- Wow...

443
00:21:19,734 --> 00:21:23,213
[Orange Team wins the first round!]

444
00:21:24,376 --> 00:21:27,831
<i>There are two other items left.
There's the egg and the fork.</i>

445
00:21:27,832 --> 00:21:29,039
- What do you want to do?
- How about the egg?

446
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,157
- Egg.
- We'll do the egg.

447
00:21:31,064 --> 00:21:33,872
[Next up is the egg game.]

448
00:21:34,073 --> 00:21:36,534
<i>The next game up for the
three round sauna game is...</i>

449
00:21:36,535 --> 00:21:39,169
<i>It's the egg eating game.</i>

450
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:40,974
You will find that there's a tray
of eggs set out before you.

451
00:21:40,975 --> 00:21:44,984
Amongst them... there is one raw egg.

452
00:21:44,985 --> 00:21:50,494
[Just one out of the 30 eggs
on the tray is a raw egg.]

453
00:21:50,495 --> 00:21:53,445
<i>The team that chooses the raw egg
loses the game.</i>

454
00:21:53,446 --> 00:21:56,266
[Will take turns to crack open an egg,
and the team that chooses the raw egg loses.]

455
00:21:56,267 --> 00:21:57,836
- It's a very simple game.
- This sounds like fun!

456
00:21:58,644 --> 00:22:01,707
[A simple yet a nerve-wrecking game.]

457
00:22:02,965 --> 00:22:05,765
[Even if the hand grazes the egg,
that egg will be deemed chosen.]

458
00:22:05,766 --> 00:22:07,188
To be honest...

459
00:22:07,851 --> 00:22:09,665
I was in the chicken business
for ten years.

460
00:22:09,666 --> 00:22:12,947
[Kyung Gyu's deep history with chickens?]

461
00:22:12,948 --> 00:22:15,747
[Can tell just by looking?]

462
00:22:15,748 --> 00:22:18,156
I can tell if the egg is fertilized or not
just by looking at it.

463
00:22:18,962 --> 00:22:22,589
It's so easy for me to tell the difference
between a hardboiled egg and a raw egg.

464
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:24,226
- I think I'll be able to tell too.
- I see it right there.

465
00:22:24,227 --> 00:22:26,221
- Where?
- There.

466
00:22:26,222 --> 00:22:28,459
- It's that one.
- Which one?

467
00:22:28,459 --> 00:22:31,189
What's the difference between
the raw egg and the hardboiled egg?

468
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:32,313
- Huh?
- What's the difference?

469
00:22:37,806 --> 00:22:39,677
- Hang on...
- Why?

470
00:22:40,394 --> 00:22:42,074
How many years have you
been doing this?

471
00:22:42,932 --> 00:22:45,482
How many years have you been doing this?
You're a funny kid.

472
00:22:46,691 --> 00:22:49,406
Did you hear that?
Kyung Gyu told me that I'm funny.

473
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:53,433
But I noticed that you don't speak
very harshly to Jae Suk.

474
00:22:53,434 --> 00:22:55,430
- What?
- You don't speak harshly to him.

475
00:22:59,273 --> 00:23:02,163
[Immediate discomfort]

476
00:23:02,164 --> 00:23:03,806
What have I done wrong?

477
00:23:04,915 --> 00:23:07,893
[Grabbing him by the throat.]

478
00:23:07,894 --> 00:23:09,922
Why are you trying to grab me?
You should be grabbing him!

479
00:23:13,554 --> 00:23:16,006
Kyung Gyu!
You grabbed your foot with that hand!

480
00:23:17,507 --> 00:23:21,013
I already told you this earlier, but
Kyung Gyu's always been very kind to me.

481
00:23:21,013 --> 00:23:22,749
- I wonder why he favors you?
- Hey...

482
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:23,926
Is it because of his popularity?

483
00:23:24,374 --> 00:23:27,247
It wouldn't be very nice of me to
like him just because of his popularity.

484
00:23:27,247 --> 00:23:29,624
I started liking him back
when he was still pretty anonymous.

485
00:23:29,624 --> 00:23:30,720
- Really?
- That's right.

486
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,788
Did you know who I was even back
when I was anonymous?

487
00:23:36,264 --> 00:23:39,827
The Kyung Gyu I know doesn't like
people who aren't famous.

488
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:41,750
Kyung Gyu!

489
00:23:41,751 --> 00:23:44,695
[Kyung Gyu's affection fluctuates
depending on the popularity level.]

490
00:23:44,696 --> 00:23:45,778
Seriously...

491
00:23:45,779 --> 00:23:46,929
How should we start the game?

492
00:23:46,930 --> 00:23:50,556
<i>Since you won the previous game,
you can decide who goes first.</i>

493
00:23:51,299 --> 00:23:53,401
- They can go.
- Let them go first?

494
00:23:53,908 --> 00:23:56,314
[Blue Team to pick the first egg.]

495
00:23:56,315 --> 00:23:58,380
We go back and forth taking turns, right?

496
00:23:58,381 --> 00:24:00,050
[Of the 30 eggs, only one is a raw egg.]

497
00:24:00,239 --> 00:24:02,650
- This is the one I choose.
- One in thirty chance?

498
00:24:03,347 --> 00:24:04,938
Come on, you have to hit it harder.

499
00:24:04,939 --> 00:24:06,621
[King of cry-babies.]

500
00:24:09,513 --> 00:24:11,379
You find this painful too?

501
00:24:13,302 --> 00:24:15,295
- You want me to do it for you?
- There you go.

502
00:24:15,296 --> 00:24:17,466
- Forehead seems easiest.
- Enjoy your egg.

503
00:24:17,467 --> 00:24:18,998
- Miss Blank?
- Look very carefully.

504
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:20,431
You have to look very closely.

505
00:24:20,432 --> 00:24:22,731
- There are 30 to choose from.
- Just choose one.

506
00:24:24,481 --> 00:24:26,228
- Break it on your forehead.
- Your forehead.

507
00:24:26,487 --> 00:24:27,953
There you go.

508
00:24:28,652 --> 00:24:31,249
[Fearless Blank Ji's head butt.]

509
00:24:31,548 --> 00:24:33,127
What kind of a woman are you?

510
00:24:33,128 --> 00:24:36,727
- I didn't think it'd hurt like that.
- I can't believe the cracking sound it made.

511
00:24:36,728 --> 00:24:40,360
Miss Song... she carries 80%
of this show.

512
00:24:40,971 --> 00:24:43,969
[In Gwon's turn.]

513
00:24:43,970 --> 00:24:46,247
- Once in a while, you...
- Why do you have that funny expression?

514
00:24:46,248 --> 00:24:48,701
[Once chosen, can't switch out!]

515
00:24:48,702 --> 00:24:50,316
- You have to keep that one!
- You can't switch it out!

516
00:24:50,317 --> 00:24:52,209
- Do it on your forehead.
- Do it right.

517
00:24:53,152 --> 00:24:54,920
[Lucky! Pass.]

518
00:24:54,921 --> 00:24:56,342
You scared me.

519
00:24:56,343 --> 00:24:58,852
Why are you all so afraid of this?

520
00:24:58,853 --> 00:25:01,777
If that egg had turned out to be raw,
that would've been classic variety material.

521
00:25:01,778 --> 00:25:03,313
- Kwang Soo!
- Kwang Soo!

522
00:25:03,314 --> 00:25:07,276
Kwang Soo, you think the god of variety
could be smiling down on you again?

523
00:25:07,277 --> 00:25:08,566
It was a hardboiled egg.

524
00:25:10,153 --> 00:25:13,093
[Sense of unease increasing as more
people pass one by one.]

525
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:15,586
Ugh, that scared me for a moment.

526
00:25:16,376 --> 00:25:18,402
[Gary also passes.]

527
00:25:18,403 --> 00:25:20,742
- This is just pure luck.
- You can't think too hard about it.

528
00:25:20,743 --> 00:25:22,126
- I'm getting nervous.
- Okay.

529
00:25:22,127 --> 00:25:24,631
- Are you taking off your glasses?
- Okay, go ahead.

530
00:25:25,658 --> 00:25:27,168
[Big-nosed Brother passes.]

531
00:25:27,169 --> 00:25:29,254
- Do a wave.
- Don't pick the raw egg.

532
00:25:29,255 --> 00:25:31,110
- Just slam it on your head.
- Maybe we can win this one.

533
00:25:31,111 --> 00:25:32,923
[Pass. Hyun Kyung also
gets a hardboiled egg.]

534
00:25:32,924 --> 00:25:35,496
- Kyung Gyu...
- Show us what you can do.

535
00:25:35,497 --> 00:25:37,340
Save our show for us, Kyung Gyu.

536
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:40,000
Take a very close look, and
save the show for us, Kyung Gyu.

537
00:25:40,001 --> 00:25:41,006
Kyung Gyu, do this for us.

538
00:25:41,007 --> 00:25:44,402
Let the egg yolk sit right between your
eyebrows and become your third eye.

539
00:25:44,403 --> 00:25:46,612
Please save our program today.

540
00:25:46,613 --> 00:25:49,120
Crack the egg so that the yolk looks like
your third eyeball on your forehead.

541
00:25:49,121 --> 00:25:52,226
- If I get the raw egg, we win?
- No, we lose.

542
00:25:52,227 --> 00:25:53,895
- We lose.
- Oh, we lose?

543
00:25:53,896 --> 00:25:55,972
- But that would make the show funny.
- We can't lose.

544
00:25:55,973 --> 00:25:57,211
That would make the show
very funny though.

545
00:25:57,753 --> 00:26:00,644
- What if that's raw?
- This is definitely a hardboiled egg.

546
00:26:00,645 --> 00:26:01,933
It's a given.

547
00:26:02,637 --> 00:26:04,402
[Immediately passes.]

548
00:26:05,819 --> 00:26:09,723
- I hope Kim Jong Kook gets it.
- Yeah. The way he's been behaving all day...

549
00:26:10,890 --> 00:26:13,347
[Been definitely pegged
as the least favorite.]

550
00:26:13,348 --> 00:26:15,195
- I'm just playing earnestly.
- What?

551
00:26:15,196 --> 00:26:16,846
- I'm just playing earnestly.
- You're saying that's all it is?

552
00:26:16,847 --> 00:26:18,340
Watch the program and see if
that's all it is.

553
00:26:18,341 --> 00:26:21,260
You're more talk than anything else.

554
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:25,083
[His no-nonsense straight talk.]

555
00:26:25,532 --> 00:26:27,687
Just pick one, pick it.

556
00:26:30,535 --> 00:26:33,837
- Get it, Kim Jong Kook.
- Just pick the raw egg.

557
00:26:33,838 --> 00:26:35,912
Just pick one!

558
00:26:38,117 --> 00:26:39,399
[Coach Kkuk also passes.]

559
00:26:40,919 --> 00:26:44,493
There's no need to start
worrying yet.

560
00:26:44,494 --> 00:26:46,023
- He always seems to get caught.
- I know.

561
00:26:46,024 --> 00:26:48,701
I doubt that.
It's not time for that yet.

562
00:26:49,079 --> 00:26:51,060
[Jae Suk also passes.]

563
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,953
- Next up is...
- Dong Hoon.

564
00:26:53,954 --> 00:26:55,141
[Made one full round,
so there are 20 eggs left now.]

565
00:26:55,142 --> 00:26:57,519
- How many are there left?
- Ten of them are gone now.

566
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:00,254
- Okay, here I go.
- It's okay. It's still okay.

567
00:27:02,006 --> 00:27:04,023
[Ro-Ro passes.]

568
00:27:05,378 --> 00:27:08,504
- I really hope Ji Hyo gets it.
- What did you say?

569
00:27:10,437 --> 00:27:12,991
- I bet it's the raw egg.
- No way.

570
00:27:12,992 --> 00:27:14,821
- I doubt it.
- It's not time for that yet.

571
00:27:14,822 --> 00:27:16,977
- I have a weird feeling about it.
- It's okay. Do it with confidence.

572
00:27:16,978 --> 00:27:18,783
- That's such a relief!
- It hurts!

573
00:27:18,784 --> 00:27:20,878
How come it sounds so loud
when you crack it?

574
00:27:20,879 --> 00:27:22,910
- Oh my...
- She must have a nice forehead.

575
00:27:22,911 --> 00:27:25,784
- Her forehead must be strong.
- You crack it so nicely.

576
00:27:25,785 --> 00:27:29,377
It sounds like she's cracking it
with a nail and hammer.

577
00:27:29,378 --> 00:27:32,571
- In Gwon...
- You have a nice forehead.

578
00:27:32,572 --> 00:27:34,320
[In Gwon's turn]

579
00:27:34,321 --> 00:27:36,455
- I bet it's In Gwon.
- In Gwon!

580
00:27:37,099 --> 00:27:39,048
[Safely passes again]

581
00:27:39,736 --> 00:27:41,319
I don't think it's going to be him.

582
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:43,140
Kwang Soo usually gets things like this.

583
00:27:43,141 --> 00:27:45,596
- I still have a chance.
- He always gets things like this.

584
00:27:49,695 --> 00:27:51,766
[There it is!]

585
00:27:53,646 --> 00:27:57,330
[Shocked]

586
00:27:58,729 --> 00:28:02,144
[Why do things like this
always happen to Kwang Soo?]

587
00:28:02,145 --> 00:28:04,242
Things like this always
strangely happen to Kwang Soo.

588
00:28:04,243 --> 00:28:07,983
All the real comedic things happen to him.
Here, I'll massage it in for you.

589
00:28:07,984 --> 00:28:11,368
- It's just so weird!
- Kwang Soo, raw eggs are good for your skin.

590
00:28:11,369 --> 00:28:13,667
Maybe the variety gods
are looking down upon you.

591
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:18,297
[Things like this and his popularity in
the Southeast are inexplicable.]

592
00:28:18,298 --> 00:28:21,489
- Did a staff member tell you?
- No, he didn't know.

593
00:28:22,213 --> 00:28:24,702
[So uncanny that people are even
starting to suspect him.]

594
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:26,322
What do you mean, you're jealous of me?

595
00:28:26,323 --> 00:28:28,929
This is something that anyone in
variety would want to happen to them.

596
00:28:28,930 --> 00:28:30,252
No kidding!

597
00:28:30,674 --> 00:28:33,718
[The next round is-
One raw egg in a tray of 20 eggs.]

598
00:28:33,719 --> 00:28:36,564
<i>This time, instead of 30 eggs,
there are only 20.</i>

599
00:28:37,235 --> 00:28:40,133
Let's just count this as lunch,
and not waste time eating lunch.

600
00:28:40,134 --> 00:28:41,464
Okay.

601
00:28:41,465 --> 00:28:44,437
[Encouraging others not to waste time by
eating and dragging out the time any longer.]

602
00:28:45,138 --> 00:28:48,244
- Why bother eating lunch?
- He thinks this should be our lunch.

603
00:28:48,681 --> 00:28:51,290
We can end the shoot early,
and go out to eat something good.

604
00:28:51,291 --> 00:28:54,180
What do you want to do by finishing early?
That's what I'm always so curious about.

605
00:28:54,181 --> 00:28:56,341
What do you always do by finishing
up the shoot early?

606
00:28:56,342 --> 00:28:58,131
Do you go home?

607
00:29:00,537 --> 00:29:03,479
- Your wife thinks you work late, right?
- She thinks you work until midnight?

608
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,987
Most people usually thinks that I
shoot through the night until the morning.

609
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:10,166
[Open talk show?]

610
00:29:10,167 --> 00:29:12,790
- We often shoot late into the night.
- You know it always happens.

611
00:29:12,791 --> 00:29:14,268
We'll start with Kwang Soo.

612
00:29:14,269 --> 00:29:16,270
- Okay.
- Start us off, Kwang Soo.

613
00:29:16,271 --> 00:29:18,508
- If you get it again this time...
- That would seriously be...

614
00:29:18,509 --> 00:29:20,537
- There's no way he'd get it.
- That would be crazy.

615
00:29:24,392 --> 00:29:27,366
[No way!]

616
00:29:27,367 --> 00:29:30,349
[The god of variety is smiling upon him.]

617
00:29:32,068 --> 00:29:36,533
[Even though we just witnessed the scene,
it's still hard to believe it happened!]

618
00:29:38,441 --> 00:29:39,978
Hey!
How can this be?

619
00:29:45,876 --> 00:29:48,799
[Truly shocking and astonishing.]

620
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,223
Hey... that's unbelievable!

621
00:29:50,224 --> 00:29:54,316
[Of all the eggs out of 20,
the one he chooses happens to be...]

622
00:29:54,317 --> 00:29:56,385
The variety gods are smiling
down on you!

623
00:29:56,386 --> 00:29:58,340
If this was a match,
we'd have to throw in the towel.

624
00:30:00,876 --> 00:30:04,144
[Game two - Blue Team wins!]

625
00:30:05,667 --> 00:30:08,130
[Streak of bad luck
that seems to know no end.]

626
00:30:08,131 --> 00:30:13,241
[Icon of bad luck...
his name is Giraffe.]

627
00:30:13,242 --> 00:30:15,580
How can you be so unlucky?

628
00:30:15,581 --> 00:30:18,341
No, he is lucky!
He is very lucky.

629
00:30:18,342 --> 00:30:21,364
If you look at it personally,
you have no luck. But on the variety side...

630
00:30:21,365 --> 00:30:22,645
[Giraffe ending the game in one blow.]

631
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:26,023
- The gods are seriously looking out for you.
- The variety gods are helping you out.

632
00:30:26,024 --> 00:30:28,759
- Can't we still have our turn?
- I'll massage it in for you.

633
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,519
You should massage it in.
This is seriously...

634
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:32,910
Since we don't get to play this often,
shouldn't we at least do it once more?

635
00:30:34,085 --> 00:30:37,551
- Aren't we done with this game?
- Not fair that you get to do it all.

636
00:30:38,954 --> 00:30:40,820
What wrong have I done?

637
00:30:42,246 --> 00:30:44,602
What?
We're going to be done early?

638
00:30:45,167 --> 00:30:47,156
Even though I like that this game
ended so quick...

639
00:30:47,926 --> 00:30:49,854
Seriously... I'm not playing.

640
00:30:49,855 --> 00:30:52,137
- I'm not playing.
- Out of 20 eggs, how could he...

641
00:30:52,138 --> 00:30:54,059
Then we should move on
to the last game.

642
00:30:56,533 --> 00:30:58,551
What is the last game?
What are we playing?

643
00:30:58,552 --> 00:31:00,073
What is this?

644
00:31:00,074 --> 00:31:03,069
[It's a fork related game...]

645
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:06,695
<i>The next game...
is the coin rolling game.</i>

646
00:31:06,696 --> 00:31:11,612
<i>You have to roll the coin to get it to
stick to the prongs in the fork.</i>

647
00:31:11,613 --> 00:31:13,772
[Roll the coin to stick between the prongs.
First team to score three points wins.]

648
00:31:13,773 --> 00:31:16,073
You have to roll it to stick it
between the prongs.

649
00:31:16,074 --> 00:31:18,980
- I guess it's possible.
- I think you can roll it in between.

650
00:31:18,981 --> 00:31:23,146
All the games being played today are something
anyone can play as long as they're breathing.

651
00:31:23,801 --> 00:31:26,557
- What are you saying?
- How can you say it like that?

652
00:31:26,558 --> 00:31:29,091
How can you say that to my big brother?

653
00:31:29,092 --> 00:31:30,404
[Kkuk keeps on provoking Kyung Gyu.]

654
00:31:30,405 --> 00:31:32,719
- How can you say it in those words?
- I was talking about the game!

655
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,211
Why are you just sitting there quietly,
Kyung Gyu?

656
00:31:34,212 --> 00:31:36,142
Are you saying that he's just
sitting here breathing right now?

657
00:31:36,143 --> 00:31:39,773
I was talking about the games.
I was describing how simple they are.

658
00:31:39,774 --> 00:31:42,160
To be honest,
just as Kyung Gyu said earlier...

659
00:31:42,161 --> 00:31:46,093
that with the movie release coming up,
he says he's unable to sleep these days.

660
00:31:46,094 --> 00:31:49,153
- He can't even sleep.
- I'm sure it'll be a success.

661
00:31:49,154 --> 00:31:52,824
Hey... stop sounding so condescending.

662
00:31:54,587 --> 00:31:57,455
- I just said it'll be successful!
- You sounded condescending.

663
00:31:58,132 --> 00:32:00,159
I was being very sincere!

664
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:02,067
This was your expression when you said it.
'I'm sure it'll be successful.'

665
00:32:02,068 --> 00:32:03,379
[Getting angry at the insincere way
Kkuk made his comment.]

666
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:05,218
- I didn't say it like that!
- Yes, you did!

667
00:32:05,219 --> 00:32:08,848
If you had said, 'You'll be successfully',
it would've been totally different!

668
00:32:08,849 --> 00:32:11,840
- You really think that's the way I said it?
- Don't even talk about my movie around me.

669
00:32:11,841 --> 00:32:13,445
- Brother, that's not how I meant it.
- You...

670
00:32:13,446 --> 00:32:17,415
Don't call me your brother.
Save that for your real big brother at home.

671
00:32:22,109 --> 00:32:25,030
- You do as I tell you!
- You can call me 'mister' from now on.

672
00:32:25,427 --> 00:32:26,859
Just call me 'mister'.

673
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:29,535
What do you think you're doing?
Don't act like we're close.

674
00:32:32,195 --> 00:32:34,000
Don't you think this is hilarious?

675
00:32:34,001 --> 00:32:35,942
The way he just exploded like that?

676
00:32:38,699 --> 00:32:42,482
I love things like this.
It feels really lively in here now.

677
00:32:42,483 --> 00:32:44,916
[A lively guest who refuses to be
treated like a guest on the show.]

678
00:32:45,632 --> 00:32:47,651
You are still the same as ever.

679
00:32:47,652 --> 00:32:49,449
- Seriously..
- Let's start rolling.

680
00:32:50,515 --> 00:32:51,497
- Let's start rolling.
- Okay.

681
00:32:51,498 --> 00:32:53,452
<i>I will give you all a moment to
practice first.</i>

682
00:32:53,453 --> 00:32:55,017
- Practice?
- Can we try it now?

683
00:32:56,647 --> 00:32:59,526
[Huh?]

684
00:33:01,848 --> 00:33:03,282
Mister!

685
00:33:03,283 --> 00:33:05,633
Why are you doing that?
Our team is trying to play.

686
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:09,095
[Actively interfering with the
other team's practicing.]

687
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:12,907
- I bet that's got to be really annoying.
- Mister!

688
00:33:14,343 --> 00:33:17,380
[Plans to interfere outright
to make them too upset to play.]

689
00:33:18,118 --> 00:33:20,611
When I was a younger, there was
this arcade by my house...

690
00:33:20,611 --> 00:33:26,309
and the owner of that arcade room
used to be kind of infuriating like this.

691
00:33:27,042 --> 00:33:30,094
- You know those mean store owners?
- And nothing was for free, right?

692
00:33:30,094 --> 00:33:31,608
- Over.
- Over?

693
00:33:31,609 --> 00:33:33,534
In Gwon, you go first.

694
00:33:33,535 --> 00:33:34,649
Challenge.

695
00:33:35,379 --> 00:33:38,418
- In Gwon...
- You think you can do this, In Gwon?

696
00:33:38,419 --> 00:33:40,953
- Give it a try.
- I think I can do it.

697
00:33:40,954 --> 00:33:43,315
[Oh?
His throw is...]

698
00:33:48,558 --> 00:33:51,752
[The coin rolling at a super-fast speed!]

699
00:33:51,753 --> 00:33:53,532
I bet if you aim it right,
it'll really get stuck there.

700
00:33:53,533 --> 00:33:56,080
[Will his throw make it?]

701
00:33:56,081 --> 00:33:57,741
[Ah, his throw is slightly off the mark.]

702
00:34:04,616 --> 00:34:06,911
[Ah... too bad!]

703
00:34:08,127 --> 00:34:10,380
[In Gwon- Fail]

704
00:34:11,999 --> 00:34:14,500
Even though he has the skills,
the variety gods don't like him.

705
00:34:14,501 --> 00:34:15,675
[Even with his skills,
the gods aren't favoring him.]

706
00:34:16,785 --> 00:34:18,893
[Kkuk's turn.]

707
00:34:23,203 --> 00:34:25,427
That's the best you can do
with those arms of yours?

708
00:34:30,865 --> 00:34:32,734
[So close, yet fails!]

709
00:34:32,735 --> 00:34:35,226
- That was so close!
- What do we do?

710
00:34:35,227 --> 00:34:38,025
What's the point of having big arms?
Next!

711
00:34:38,837 --> 00:34:41,237
- It's because you're sitting up there.
- I agree.

712
00:34:41,683 --> 00:34:43,443
[Say what?]

713
00:34:43,444 --> 00:34:46,551
[Fine then, I'll turn around.]

714
00:34:47,939 --> 00:34:51,213
[The Big-brother's chic back turn?]

715
00:34:51,214 --> 00:34:52,581
How's that?

716
00:34:53,887 --> 00:34:55,833
Ha Ha's usually pretty funny.

717
00:34:55,834 --> 00:34:57,656
[Ha Ha's turn]

718
00:35:00,621 --> 00:35:02,756
[Ah... so close!]

719
00:35:05,571 --> 00:35:06,972
- He's got it.
- He's got it!

720
00:35:09,292 --> 00:35:11,823
[Another close call!]

721
00:35:11,824 --> 00:35:14,717
- Wow... I thought that was going to make it.
- It's not easy getting it in there.

722
00:35:14,718 --> 00:35:15,901
[Blue Team- Zero success.]

723
00:35:17,434 --> 00:35:19,569
[Orange Team's turn.]

724
00:35:19,822 --> 00:35:21,272
Like this, Ji Hyo.

725
00:35:21,273 --> 00:35:24,372
[Blank Ji takes the first turn.]

726
00:35:24,566 --> 00:35:26,116
There you go, there you go!

727
00:35:26,746 --> 00:35:27,884
[Too bad...]

728
00:35:27,885 --> 00:35:29,064
Fail.

729
00:35:29,065 --> 00:35:31,101
[How will she do this time?]

730
00:35:31,848 --> 00:35:33,869
- There you go, there you go!
- Nice!

731
00:35:33,870 --> 00:35:37,001
[What!]

732
00:35:39,344 --> 00:35:42,439
[It went in!]

733
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:44,449
[Amazing!]

734
00:35:49,157 --> 00:35:50,918
[An amazing woman...
she truly is our Blank Ji.]

735
00:35:50,919 --> 00:35:52,552
Wow...

736
00:35:53,908 --> 00:35:55,979
How does she do it?

737
00:35:56,402 --> 00:35:58,664
How can she be so good
at everything?

738
00:35:59,491 --> 00:36:02,612
Ji Hyo always does well,
but Kwang Soo always does bad.

739
00:36:02,613 --> 00:36:04,778
- You're right!
- She does well at everything.

740
00:36:04,779 --> 00:36:06,948
- We need both of them on this show.
- That's what I'm saying.

741
00:36:06,949 --> 00:36:10,331
So that's why the team they're on
never gets to win at anything.

742
00:36:10,332 --> 00:36:13,524
They zero each other out.
She wins and he loses.

743
00:36:13,525 --> 00:36:14,936
Challenge.

744
00:36:14,937 --> 00:36:16,198
[Icon of bad luck, Kwang Soo's turn.]

745
00:36:16,199 --> 00:36:18,159
Kwang Soo's luck, he'd knock that out.

746
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:21,703
He'd totally have the comedic effect
of knocking it out of place.

747
00:36:21,704 --> 00:36:23,725
Kwang Soo would more than do that.

748
00:36:23,726 --> 00:36:25,038
You can do that.

749
00:36:26,319 --> 00:36:28,389
- I'll do it fast.
- You're doing good.

750
00:36:29,481 --> 00:36:31,170
[Oh?]

751
00:36:33,671 --> 00:36:36,883
[Wow... Kwang Soo also succeeds!]

752
00:36:37,558 --> 00:36:40,375
[The variety gods must favor him...]

753
00:36:41,457 --> 00:36:43,263
We've got two now.

754
00:36:43,264 --> 00:36:44,565
[Orange Team with two successes already.]

755
00:36:44,266 --> 00:36:45,845
Kyung Gyu it's your turn.

756
00:36:45,846 --> 00:36:47,679
Kyung Gyu's taking his turn,
so let's all be quiet.

757
00:36:50,754 --> 00:36:53,684
[Gets upset with everything that comes
out of Kkuk's mouth.]

758
00:36:53,685 --> 00:36:55,443
- Just be quiet!
- What did I say?

759
00:36:55,895 --> 00:36:58,929
- What? I was trying to help you!
- Just stay quiet!

760
00:36:58,930 --> 00:37:01,217
I know I told you not to say anything.

761
00:37:10,211 --> 00:37:14,948
- If you do this, your movie will be a hit.
- No, don't say things like that.

762
00:37:14,949 --> 00:37:16,553
Put the success of your
movie on the line.

763
00:37:17,090 --> 00:37:18,715
Don't say that.

764
00:37:19,835 --> 00:37:23,980
[Will Kyung Gyu...]

765
00:37:23,981 --> 00:37:27,509
[Oh my!]

766
00:37:28,783 --> 00:37:31,635
[It went in!]

767
00:37:35,993 --> 00:37:37,977
Mister!
It's going to be a hit!

768
00:37:38,688 --> 00:37:42,090
[Is this really a sign of a hit?]

769
00:37:55,421 --> 00:37:58,348
- Wow, that really was awesome.
- There are two 'Misters' in our country.

770
00:37:58,349 --> 00:38:00,054
Won Bin and Lee Kyung Gyu.

771
00:38:00,738 --> 00:38:02,487
Won Bin and Lee Kyung Gyu.

772
00:38:03,609 --> 00:38:06,385
And thus, our Orange Team wins!

773
00:38:06,386 --> 00:38:08,289
[Orange Team wins!]

774
00:38:10,368 --> 00:38:13,674
[The winning team can choose their coin.]

775
00:38:13,675 --> 00:38:19,825
[Must choose between
the gold and the silver coin.]

776
00:38:19,826 --> 00:38:22,143
This is brighter.
This one looks more expensive.

777
00:38:22,144 --> 00:38:24,146
With how shiny this one looks...

778
00:38:24,147 --> 00:38:27,293
it makes us think that we should be
taking this one, right?

779
00:38:27,294 --> 00:38:30,321
So since this one is shinier,
we should take this one, don't you think?

780
00:38:30,322 --> 00:38:34,917
- You're saying you want this one?
- Since this is shinier, we should take this.

781
00:38:34,918 --> 00:38:36,631
[The Orange Team ends up choosing
the shinier of the two, and takes the gold.]

782
00:38:36,715 --> 00:38:38,214
Okay, we'll take this one.

783
00:38:46,563 --> 00:38:49,693
[Seoul's 'E' Center in Sangamdong.]

784
00:38:51,159 --> 00:38:55,018
[What kind of a mission
awaits them this time?]

785
00:38:56,668 --> 00:38:58,877
Dodge ball is a real game.

786
00:38:59,838 --> 00:39:01,889
[A dodge ball game?]

787
00:39:03,262 --> 00:39:05,506
<i>Okay, here's your mission card.</i>

788
00:39:10,707 --> 00:39:13,615
- How is it those two go up together?
- They're always like that.

789
00:39:13,616 --> 00:39:15,571
Stop following me around.
It's annoying.

790
00:39:15,572 --> 00:39:17,864
<i>[You lose if the ball hits the king.]</i>

791
00:39:17,865 --> 00:39:19,584
Then I guess Kyung Gyu will be the king?

792
00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:23,404
- Kyung Gyu...
- Since he's the king of variety...

793
00:39:23,405 --> 00:39:25,154
Chairman of variety...
god of variety.

794
00:39:25,586 --> 00:39:28,423
[Orange Team's god of variety
is Kyung Gyu?]

795
00:39:28,424 --> 00:39:30,870
[The king from each team will be
the oldest person on the team.]

796
00:39:30,871 --> 00:39:33,494
- Then you'd be the king.
- I usually get hit all the time.

797
00:39:35,137 --> 00:39:36,968
<i>King of comedy and king of singing...</i>

798
00:39:36,969 --> 00:39:43,015
<i>So you two can be the kings,
and your servants can then protect you.</i>

799
00:39:43,016 --> 00:39:44,595
[The team members must
protect their king.]

800
00:39:44,596 --> 00:39:47,293
[If the king gets hit,
then the team loses.]

801
00:39:47,294 --> 00:39:48,778
- I like things like this.
- Being protected.

802
00:39:48,779 --> 00:39:51,450
[Big brother enjoying being protected
by his loyal subjects.]

803
00:39:51,451 --> 00:39:53,524
<i>The last protector left on the field
cannot be ousted.</i>

804
00:39:53,525 --> 00:39:55,622
<i>That person will remain to the end
to protect their king.</i>

805
00:39:55,623 --> 00:40:00,105
<i>We're going to play best out of three.
We need to decide who'll go first.</i>

806
00:40:00,106 --> 00:40:03,092
<i>Both teams needs to go stand
at the edge of your line.</i>

807
00:40:05,142 --> 00:40:08,574
<i>Okay, place the hat on your king's head.</i>

808
00:40:08,575 --> 00:40:11,961
I've never seen Kyung Gyu
wear a beanie hat.

809
00:40:12,705 --> 00:40:15,857
[A rare moment?]

810
00:40:20,417 --> 00:40:23,251
[Big brother being transformed
into a wooden match.]

811
00:40:24,789 --> 00:40:27,107
- You have to fold it over a little.
- Really?

812
00:40:27,108 --> 00:40:28,641
- Yes.
- Like this?

813
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:31,844
Kyung Gyu's really holding
himself back right now.

814
00:40:31,845 --> 00:40:36,566
- Kyung Gyu's really changed!
- I told you that my personality's changed.

815
00:40:36,567 --> 00:40:39,099
If it was still back in the day,
he'd never put up with this.

816
00:40:39,457 --> 00:40:41,342
He'd be telling you not to bring it out.

817
00:40:41,343 --> 00:40:43,701
- He would never have worn that.
- Because it's too much.

818
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:49,304
[But somehow, he's been transformed
into an icon of love and consideration.]

819
00:40:51,625 --> 00:40:53,216
<i>Okay, ready...</i>

820
00:40:53,217 --> 00:40:55,994
<i>The team to grab
the ball first gets to attack.</i>

821
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:57,101
<i>Ready...</i>

822
00:40:59,672 --> 00:41:02,225
[Giraffe from the Orange Team
was the fastest!]

823
00:41:02,942 --> 00:41:04,940
[Backtracking]

824
00:41:04,941 --> 00:41:08,157
- We've got it.
- It's okay, Dong Hoon. Next time.

825
00:41:08,158 --> 00:41:11,200
- There's no way I'd get hit in this spot.
- Even if the ball is thrown...

826
00:41:11,201 --> 00:41:13,722
Even when they throw the ball,
we'd be able to block it from you.

827
00:41:13,723 --> 00:41:15,474
Hit him directly.

828
00:41:19,034 --> 00:41:21,838
We have to line up.
Guard Kyung Gyu.

829
00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:22,991
[It's the Orange Team's turn
to play defense.]

830
00:41:27,438 --> 00:41:29,650
[Suk Jin - Out!]

831
00:41:34,051 --> 00:41:36,955
[Blue Team doing a good job
of escaping!]

832
00:41:42,087 --> 00:41:44,722
[As soon as he's ousted, he grabs
an out of bounds ball to attack!]

833
00:41:54,113 --> 00:41:56,045
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

834
00:41:56,405 --> 00:41:59,787
[So frail all of a sudden?]

835
00:42:00,826 --> 00:42:02,151
Be careful!

836
00:42:06,037 --> 00:42:08,323
[Jae Suk - Out!]

837
00:42:09,016 --> 00:42:10,476
One more.
There's one more.

838
00:42:11,758 --> 00:42:15,156
[As soon as the ball's in the other court,
the team immediately gets into shield mode.]

839
00:42:17,666 --> 00:42:18,893
[She caught it!]

840
00:42:19,737 --> 00:42:21,731
[She catches that fast throw!]

841
00:42:31,721 --> 00:42:34,117
- I can't believe it!
- Is she trying out for the Olympics?

842
00:42:34,118 --> 00:42:36,565
Why is she so good?
She's not even a dodge ball player.

843
00:42:36,566 --> 00:42:39,356
[Hyun Kyung showing
unexpected athletic skills.]

844
00:42:39,357 --> 00:42:41,214
That ball should've been ours!

845
00:42:41,215 --> 00:42:43,059
That's right!

846
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:44,877
[In Gwon - Out!]

847
00:42:48,856 --> 00:42:51,095
[Hyun Kyung throwing the ball
with teeth gritted!]

848
00:42:54,809 --> 00:42:56,121
Watch out!

849
00:42:56,122 --> 00:42:57,598
Out!
Kwang Soo's out!

850
00:42:59,943 --> 00:43:02,289
[Just then, the Orange Team
falls into danger!]

851
00:43:08,014 --> 00:43:10,432
[If the king is hit,
the team loses immediately!]

852
00:43:10,796 --> 00:43:13,144
[Ji Hyo just barely manages to block it!]

853
00:43:13,145 --> 00:43:14,683
Kwang Soo's out!

854
00:43:15,665 --> 00:43:17,945
[A bloody battle to take over the ball!]

855
00:43:21,769 --> 00:43:23,091
Run!

856
00:43:23,092 --> 00:43:24,209
Who's out?

857
00:43:24,210 --> 00:43:27,642
<i>Ji Hyo was ousted first.
Kwang Soo must stay in the game.</i>

858
00:43:27,643 --> 00:43:29,794
[With the king being the only other one left,
Kwang Soo must now stay in the game.]

859
00:43:29,794 --> 00:43:31,136
Grab him!
Hurry up and get him!

860
00:43:31,137 --> 00:43:32,567
[Kyung Gyu in danger!]

861
00:43:33,673 --> 00:43:35,882
[Tough Hyung Kyung once again
gets ready to attack!]

862
00:43:36,892 --> 00:43:39,460
[She hit her mark?]

863
00:43:42,267 --> 00:43:43,618
What was that?

864
00:43:44,162 --> 00:43:47,460
[Hands over it to her teammate.]

865
00:43:48,050 --> 00:43:49,578
You have to stay back, Kyung Gyu.

866
00:43:49,579 --> 00:43:51,144
You have to stay back, Kyung Gyu.

867
00:43:52,702 --> 00:43:55,705
[Giraffe having become a
shield for Kyung Gyu.]

868
00:43:57,472 --> 00:43:59,341
[Beleaguered]

869
00:43:59,342 --> 00:44:02,686
[Fragile Kyung Gyu sticking close
behind Giraffe's back in hiding.]

870
00:44:02,687 --> 00:44:04,450
- Come this way.
- Pass the ball!

871
00:44:05,435 --> 00:44:06,568
There you go!

872
00:44:06,603 --> 00:44:08,300
[Giraffe steals the ball to attack!]

873
00:44:13,021 --> 00:44:15,234
[Hyun Kyung - Out!]

874
00:44:21,108 --> 00:44:23,252
[Kyung Gyu!]

875
00:44:26,005 --> 00:44:28,150
[Huh...]

876
00:44:28,705 --> 00:44:31,023
[Immediately falls into danger.]

877
00:44:31,472 --> 00:44:33,157
[Unbelievably passes over the ball.]

878
00:44:33,158 --> 00:44:35,300
[Throws his whole body
into escaping the ball.]

879
00:44:37,174 --> 00:44:39,346
[However...]

880
00:44:39,347 --> 00:44:42,537
[Will Kyung Gyu be ousted just like this?]

881
00:44:44,785 --> 00:44:47,070
[Giraffe hits the ball out of the way!]

882
00:44:47,071 --> 00:44:48,256
[Darn!]

883
00:44:49,058 --> 00:44:51,595
[King Kyung Gyu barely escaping danger!]

884
00:44:51,596 --> 00:44:53,073
Get up!

885
00:44:54,669 --> 00:44:56,995
[King Kyung Gyu escapes his danger.]

886
00:45:01,168 --> 00:45:02,626
Wait!
Time!

887
00:45:05,726 --> 00:45:08,520
[Depleted of energy]

888
00:45:08,521 --> 00:45:10,818
- I can't believe he escaped that.
- No!

889
00:45:10,819 --> 00:45:14,290
Kyung Gyu really looks like a
frail female lead in a movie.

890
00:45:14,291 --> 00:45:16,372
Can you get an ambulance ready for us?

891
00:45:17,126 --> 00:45:18,386
Here I go!

892
00:45:19,068 --> 00:45:20,869
Pass the ball around.

893
00:45:22,131 --> 00:45:25,375
[The Orange Team passing the ball around.]

894
00:45:27,294 --> 00:45:28,360
Pass the ball around.

895
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:30,532
[Chance!]

896
00:45:30,533 --> 00:45:33,020
[Succeeds in his attack!]

897
00:45:33,021 --> 00:45:35,958
[King Jong Kook- Out!]

898
00:45:36,679 --> 00:45:39,684
[Orange Team- 1; Blue Team- 0]

899
00:45:42,707 --> 00:45:45,195
It's okay.
It's okay.

900
00:45:45,196 --> 00:45:47,010
It's okay!

901
00:45:47,011 --> 00:45:49,588
- It's okay!
- Wait...

902
00:45:49,589 --> 00:45:52,239
Hyun Kyung, you're really athletic.

903
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:55,500
You look like a real competitive athlete.

904
00:45:55,856 --> 00:45:58,453
[Unexpected shouts of battle cry.]

905
00:45:58,454 --> 00:46:00,208
I told you!
I told you that she was like that.

906
00:46:00,209 --> 00:46:02,822
- She looks like a real dodge ball player.
- Are you really athletic?

907
00:46:02,941 --> 00:46:05,973
- You've played this before, haven't you?
- I've never played dodge ball before.

908
00:46:05,974 --> 00:46:07,713
[On the other hand...]

909
00:46:09,633 --> 00:46:12,251
- What are you doing?
- Kyung Gyu's exhausted.

910
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,342
[Exhausted King Kyung Gyu]

911
00:46:15,343 --> 00:46:18,682
- Seriously...
- The match is about to light up on fire.

912
00:46:18,683 --> 00:46:21,436
Once he's on fire, it's no joke!

913
00:46:21,437 --> 00:46:23,835
Once he really gets angry...

914
00:46:25,969 --> 00:46:27,207
Let's stop playing.

915
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:31,436
[Kyung Gyu's chatter
has all of a sudden ceased.]

916
00:46:31,437 --> 00:46:37,725
I never knew... that Kyung Gyu was
so fragile or delicate.

917
00:46:37,726 --> 00:46:39,698
- He's just so...
- I never knew either.

918
00:46:40,103 --> 00:46:42,380
- You're like a little girl.
- You are like a little girl.

919
00:46:42,381 --> 00:46:43,735
We have to win!

920
00:46:43,736 --> 00:46:46,325
- We have to win.
- Fighting!

921
00:46:46,326 --> 00:46:48,429
[Second set- Start!]

922
00:46:49,872 --> 00:46:52,329
Okay, here we go.
Throw it hard!

923
00:46:52,330 --> 00:46:53,906
Throw it fast.

924
00:46:56,795 --> 00:46:59,853
[They all managed to avoid being hit!]

925
00:46:59,854 --> 00:47:02,409
Low balls are the scariest.

926
00:47:02,410 --> 00:47:03,733
[Fragile Kyung Gyu hanging on dearly.]

927
00:47:03,734 --> 00:47:05,594
Send Hyun Kyung out first.

928
00:47:05,595 --> 00:47:07,127
Send Hyun Kyung out first.

929
00:47:07,128 --> 00:47:09,373
[Oh?]

930
00:47:10,381 --> 00:47:14,014
[A knee kick from his own King Kkuk?]

931
00:47:14,015 --> 00:47:15,431
He got me in the butt with his knee.

932
00:47:16,146 --> 00:47:17,756
- You can do this.
- In Gwon!

933
00:47:19,570 --> 00:47:21,668
[Catches the ball again!]

934
00:47:24,155 --> 00:47:25,728
What was that?

935
00:47:25,729 --> 00:47:27,117
Kim Jong Kook...

936
00:47:29,401 --> 00:47:31,417
[Tough Hyung Kyung's fast throw.]

937
00:47:31,418 --> 00:47:33,944
Look at the way she's gritting her teeth!

938
00:47:37,736 --> 00:47:40,539
[Is it King Kkuk's turn?]

939
00:47:48,058 --> 00:47:50,871
[Kyung Gyu's legs giving out on him
with the Tiger's lightening throw.]

940
00:47:52,285 --> 00:47:54,205
Mister...
I'm sorry, Mister.

941
00:47:58,193 --> 00:48:00,322
[Everyone doing a good job
of avoiding the ball.]

942
00:48:00,876 --> 00:48:03,410
[Tough Hyun Kyung's turn again.]

943
00:48:08,329 --> 00:48:10,743
[Jae Suk - Out!]

944
00:48:10,744 --> 00:48:12,884
- He's out!
- I'm out.

945
00:48:12,885 --> 00:48:14,406
Catch the ball.
You can catch the ball.

946
00:48:14,407 --> 00:48:17,115
He's behind us.
Watch out, he's behind us.

947
00:48:18,212 --> 00:48:19,553
[Huh?]

948
00:48:19,554 --> 00:48:21,427
[It touched his hand...]

949
00:48:21,428 --> 00:48:22,963
- I'm out?
- You're out.

950
00:48:23,797 --> 00:48:26,354
- What are you doing?
- I was trying to catch it.

951
00:48:27,936 --> 00:48:30,114
[Oh!]

952
00:48:31,624 --> 00:48:34,655
[In Gwon losing his opportunity again.]

953
00:48:34,656 --> 00:48:36,246
Why are you so bad at this, In Gwon?

954
00:48:41,825 --> 00:48:43,749
[In Gwon - Out!]

955
00:48:43,750 --> 00:48:45,129
- Get Gary.
- Throw it low.

956
00:48:47,177 --> 00:48:50,312
- Gary...
- There you go! Gary, out!

957
00:48:50,313 --> 00:48:52,294
- Gary, out!
- Gary, get out!

958
00:48:53,128 --> 00:48:55,793
[In that case...]

959
00:48:55,794 --> 00:49:00,471
[Tough Hyun Kyung to
protect King Kkuk...]

960
00:49:00,472 --> 00:49:02,797
- You really are too much!
- That's not right!

961
00:49:02,798 --> 00:49:06,263
- How does that make any sense?
- Lets just end this right now.

962
00:49:06,264 --> 00:49:08,065
[As the king, Kkuk has no other choice...]

963
00:49:09,478 --> 00:49:11,670
[Danger!]

964
00:49:12,916 --> 00:49:15,844
[No!]

965
00:49:19,729 --> 00:49:22,404
[Guard Hyun Kyung doing
everything she can.]

966
00:49:22,405 --> 00:49:24,598
Hyun Kyung!
You're going to have to take the hit!

967
00:49:24,599 --> 00:49:26,336
[Guarding her king!]

968
00:49:27,061 --> 00:49:29,338
[Oh!
She caught the ball!]

969
00:49:32,775 --> 00:49:34,938
[Huh?]

970
00:49:35,306 --> 00:49:37,816
[After all her ferocious attacks...]

971
00:49:39,540 --> 00:49:42,096
- The ball is ours.
- Here!

972
00:49:42,097 --> 00:49:43,849
Don't throw the ball too carelessly!

973
00:49:43,850 --> 00:49:46,905
[With Hyun Kyung being a better guard than
expected, they must play the game better.]

974
00:49:46,906 --> 00:49:48,901
[King Kyung Gyu stepping in himself.]

975
00:49:51,921 --> 00:49:53,792
[Passes off the ball!]

976
00:49:55,515 --> 00:49:59,922
[With King Kyung Gyu's pass,
King Kkuk is in danger!]

977
00:49:59,923 --> 00:50:03,364
[Tough Hyung Kyung throwing her body
in to protect her king!]

978
00:50:07,148 --> 00:50:09,376
[Will she be able to block?]

979
00:50:15,134 --> 00:50:17,189
[King Jong Kook - Out!]

980
00:50:17,717 --> 00:50:20,685
[Orange Team wins!]

981
00:50:20,686 --> 00:50:23,625
- I'm so tired.
- You should've stuck closer to her.

982
00:50:23,626 --> 00:50:24,894
That was too bad.

983
00:50:25,632 --> 00:50:28,083
[Orange Team showing fantastic teamwork.]

984
00:50:28,084 --> 00:50:29,359
It's great.

985
00:50:30,223 --> 00:50:33,752
[Trying to integrate himself in
the team with every chance he sees.]

986
00:50:36,362 --> 00:50:39,926
- It's the same as before.
- Is it the gold and the silver coin again?

987
00:50:39,927 --> 00:50:43,201
[Gold and the silver coin once again.]

988
00:50:43,202 --> 00:50:44,843
You want to go with the same one?

989
00:50:44,844 --> 00:50:46,592
- That's what I was thinking. You?
- Sure.

990
00:50:46,593 --> 00:50:48,753
- What do you think?
- That sounds good.

991
00:50:49,851 --> 00:50:52,237
Don't you think you've
gotten too nice?

992
00:50:52,238 --> 00:50:53,892
Why are you asking him
for his opinion?

993
00:50:53,893 --> 00:50:55,954
You've become way too nice!

994
00:50:55,955 --> 00:50:58,726
- I just got goosebumps!
- What do you think?

995
00:50:58,727 --> 00:51:00,855
- I agree with you.
- I've never seen this before.

996
00:51:00,856 --> 00:51:02,870
- Should we go with this one?
- Let's stick to the same one.

997
00:51:02,871 --> 00:51:04,565
[Orange Team chooses the coin gold again.]

998
00:51:04,566 --> 00:51:06,948
Kyung Gyu... you've become so nice.

999
00:51:06,949 --> 00:51:10,467
- Same as the other one.
- The next location is right next to here.

1000
00:51:10,468 --> 00:51:13,061
It's right over there.
It's inside that building.

1001
00:51:13,062 --> 00:51:17,756
[The third mission location is
inside the Seoul Energy Dream Center.]

1002
00:51:17,757 --> 00:51:19,866
- What is this?
- Are we doing a race?

1003
00:51:19,867 --> 00:51:22,559
[Which mission waits for them inside?]

1004
00:51:24,710 --> 00:51:27,256
- Why is there a monitor?
- What is that?

1005
00:51:27,492 --> 00:51:31,881
[16 different split screens
on the monitor!]

1006
00:51:32,282 --> 00:51:34,552
<i>This is your last game before we
go into the final race...</i>

1007
00:51:34,553 --> 00:51:37,298
<i>It's the avatar one-on-one
name tag elimination.</i>

1008
00:51:37,299 --> 00:51:38,804
Avatar?

1009
00:51:38,805 --> 00:51:41,647
<i>It's avatar one-on-one
name tag elimination.</i>

1010
00:51:42,621 --> 00:51:47,520
[Each team sends in one member at a time
into the name tag elimination game.]

1011
00:51:47,521 --> 00:51:52,183
<i>You have to keep your transmitter on
and can only move as you're directed to move.</i>

1012
00:51:52,184 --> 00:51:53,916
<i>And thus, you must eliminate
your opponent's name tag.</i>

1013
00:51:53,917 --> 00:51:57,532
<i>Once a member is ousted,
the next person from the team must enter.</i>

1014
00:51:57,533 --> 00:52:01,102
<i>And the team with the final survivor
wins the game.</i>

1015
00:52:02,179 --> 00:52:06,714
<i>Please think carefully and choose
who will be the first avatar.</i>

1016
00:52:06,715 --> 00:52:10,149
I think Kyung Gyu should be the director.
How should we designate the order?

1017
00:52:10,149 --> 00:52:13,189
Which style do you prefer?
Hiddink or Murino?

1018
00:52:13,190 --> 00:52:15,299
Which director style should I do?

1019
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:17,658
[Is his style more along the lines
of Hiddink, or Murino?]

1020
00:52:17,659 --> 00:52:19,938
- His soccer style?
- Yes.

1021
00:52:20,472 --> 00:52:22,483
I don't... really know.

1022
00:52:23,881 --> 00:52:27,362
- What are you doing?
- I'll just wing it and yell it out.

1023
00:52:27,363 --> 00:52:29,090
Where you placed this is a little...

1024
00:52:31,253 --> 00:52:35,264
[Who will be the first avatar to go in
from the Orange Team?]

1025
00:52:34,965 --> 00:52:36,640
Don't you think sending Suk Jin in first
would be the best?

1026
00:52:36,641 --> 00:52:39,957
- Why is it always me?
- Since we don't know how this will go...

1027
00:52:39,958 --> 00:52:45,319
[Sending him in as experiment since
it's hard to predict what could happen?]

1028
00:52:45,823 --> 00:52:47,302
Let's go with Suk Jin.

1029
00:52:48,710 --> 00:52:50,980
[Orange Team's first avatar, Suk Jin.]

1030
00:52:51,565 --> 00:52:54,005
Look at the second stairwell.

1031
00:52:54,006 --> 00:52:56,374
- Do you see the stairwell?
- Yes.

1032
00:52:56,375 --> 00:53:00,425
When I tell you to jump,
I want you to jump off.

1033
00:53:01,463 --> 00:53:03,234
You want him to jump down
from the top?

1034
00:53:03,235 --> 00:53:05,787
[Rule: Must follow the director's orders.]

1035
00:53:05,788 --> 00:53:07,621
The reason being, we need the visual.

1036
00:53:07,622 --> 00:53:10,609
Even though eliminating the name tag
is also important...

1037
00:53:10,610 --> 00:53:13,815
[Director's theory:
Game is important too, but image comes first]

1038
00:53:13,816 --> 00:53:15,907
Let's all stand up.

1039
00:53:15,908 --> 00:53:17,647
[Blue Team's director is Ha Ha.]

1040
00:53:18,973 --> 00:53:20,380
We're going to get our revenge today

1041
00:53:20,381 --> 00:53:22,967
but you have to know
how to rip off the name tag.

1042
00:53:22,968 --> 00:53:27,229
[Sharing the wisdom of how to rip off
the name tags with the first timers.]

1043
00:53:27,230 --> 00:53:30,034
You have to snap it off.
All the little kids out there, watch closely.

1044
00:53:30,485 --> 00:53:34,556
[Showing the right way to rip off
the name tag in a safe manner.]

1045
00:53:34,557 --> 00:53:37,089
- Where is everyone?
- Sneak up on your target first.

1046
00:53:37,090 --> 00:53:40,169
If you rip it off like this,
he can turn around and escape.

1047
00:53:40,170 --> 00:53:41,940
That's why... there you go!

1048
00:53:41,941 --> 00:53:46,498
[Taking the time to attack
is a sure means of defeat.]

1049
00:53:46,499 --> 00:53:49,255
- This way...
- You have to concentrate and attack!

1050
00:53:49,256 --> 00:53:51,404
At all times... when you rip it off...

1051
00:53:51,405 --> 00:53:55,104
When you go in to rip it off,
with your left hand, grab the target.

1052
00:53:55,105 --> 00:53:57,515
Grab your target with the left hand,
and rip it off with your right!

1053
00:53:59,978 --> 00:54:02,812
[This is the years' worth of know-how.]

1054
00:54:02,813 --> 00:54:04,308
- Gary, out!
- Okay, I think I got it.

1055
00:54:06,687 --> 00:54:09,070
[In Gwon's turn to try.]

1056
00:54:09,071 --> 00:54:12,443
- You're saying this is no good?
- Because I can do this!

1057
00:54:12,444 --> 00:54:13,518
[Watch out for the counterattack!]

1058
00:54:17,766 --> 00:54:21,252
[That's why you must grab
the target with the left hand!]

1059
00:54:21,253 --> 00:54:23,692
- That's right!
- You have to snap it off.

1060

1064
00:54:37,583 --> 00:54:39,302
Wow, this is...

1065
00:54:41,250 --> 00:54:43,555
[An immediate face-off!]

1066
00:54:44,619 --> 00:54:47,051
- Is it In Gwon?
- They sent In Gwon first.

1067
00:54:47,052 --> 00:54:49,565
- Did he see him?
- If you see him, rip it off!

1068
00:54:49,566 --> 00:54:52,280
- There they are!
- He sees him!

1069
00:54:52,281 --> 00:54:54,777
- There they are.
- They're already facing each other.

1070
00:54:54,778 --> 00:54:57,306
[Even if they're facing off, they can't
move without the director's say.]

1071
00:54:58,669 --> 00:55:01,010
In Gwon... run up to the third floor.

1072
00:55:01,011 --> 00:55:02,873
Run off to the third floor.

1073
00:55:06,969 --> 00:55:09,943
- In Gwon's running away.
- He's running away.

1074
00:55:09,944 --> 00:55:12,804
You have to hide.
Hide yourself so he can't find you.

1075
00:55:12,805 --> 00:55:15,008
[Running away just as
Ha Ha is directing him to.]

- No, I want you to wait.</i>

1078

If you stay like that, he'll see you.</i>

1079

<i>- Behind the door.
- Hide behind the door.</i>

1080
00:55:26,558 --> 00:55:27,969
I think he went up to the third floor.

1081
00:55:27,970 --> 00:55:29,352
- Third floor!
- He's over there!

1082
00:55:29,353 --> 00:55:32,127
He's in the lecture hall on the third floor.

1083
00:55:32,128 --> 00:55:33,989
He's in the lecture hall on the third floor.

1084
00:55:33,990 --> 00:55:35,121
Third floor.

1085
00:55:36,178 --> 00:55:37,984
Let's have a face-off.

1086

- Already?
- You don't think?

[Immediately taking his teammates'
hesitation into consideration?]

1090
00:55:49,779 --> 00:55:51,912
Sit down on that sofa for a minute.

1091
00:55:54,068 --> 00:55:55,731
Okay, I'll sit down.

1092

- Get back down there and rip it off!

1094
00:56:05,308 --> 00:56:06,736

- Go back to where you were.

He's heading back down.
Watch your back.

1098

Go inside that empty room.

1099

- Into the empty room?
- Move fast! He's running away.

Why didn't he pretend to be in pain?

1120
00:57:25,941 --> 00:57:27,377
He should've pretended to be in pain.

1121
00:57:27,378 --> 00:57:30,744
He should've pretended to be in pain,
and use that moment to escape.

You have to listen to the
direction carefully.

the wall as he's instructed!]

1145
00:58:41,232 --> 00:58:42,573
Tell him to hold it.

1146
00:58:42,574 --> 00:58:44,790
If you think you're going to lose,
pretend that you're hurt.

1147
00:58:44,791 --> 00:58:46,734
Push his back up against the wall!

1148
00:58:46,735 --> 00:58:48,223
Go up to the second floor!
Run away!

1149
00:58:48,224 --> 00:58:49,769
<i>Go up to the second floor!
Run away!</i>

1150
00:58:49,770 --> 00:58:51,098
What?

1151
00:58:51,508 --> 00:58:55,224
[Telling him to run away in
the middle of an attack?]

1152
00:58:55,225 --> 00:58:56,290
Run away!

1153
00:58:56,291 --> 00:58:57,452
<i>Run away!</i>

1154
00:58:57,452 --> 00:59:00,288
[Must follow the director's orders
unconditionally.]

1155
00:59:02,606 --> 00:59:04,667
- Just run away!
- Get him!

1156
00:59:04,668 --> 00:59:06,635
- Get him!
- Go after him!

1157
00:59:06,636 --> 00:59:09,579
- Go after him!
- In Gwon's doing a good job.

1158
00:59:09,580 --> 00:59:11,277
That's good!
Go get him!

1159
00:59:11,278 --> 00:59:13,001
Why am I running away?

1160
00:59:15,948 --> 00:59:19,322
[Blue Team's avatar In Gwon vs.
Orange Team's Kwang-vatar.]

1161
00:59:29,792 --> 00:59:36,710
[Avatar In Gwon eliminates two in a row!]

1162
00:59:36,710 --> 00:59:38,974
<i>Avatar Lee Kwang Soo, out.</i>

1163
00:59:38,975 --> 00:59:40,275
<i>Avatar Lee Kwang Soo, out.</i>

1164
00:59:40,276 --> 00:59:42,198
<i>Send in the next player.</i>

1165
00:59:42,199 --> 00:59:43,984
What do we do?

1166
00:59:46,364 --> 00:59:48,388
Why did you make me run
away back there?

1167
00:59:48,389 --> 00:59:50,883
Why did you make me run away back there
while I was attacking In Gwon?

1168
00:59:50,884 --> 00:59:52,704
The director doesn't have
the time to talk.

1169
00:59:52,705 --> 00:59:55,081
Get out.
He's in no mood to talk right now.

1170
00:59:55,082 --> 00:59:56,756
- I had his name tag in my hand!
- Sorry.

1171
00:59:56,757 --> 01:00:00,576
But you looked like you were
in trouble on my screen.

1172
01:00:01,558 --> 01:00:06,412
[Kwang-vatar had In Gwon's
name tag in his hand...]

1173
01:00:06,413 --> 01:00:07,783
<i>Run up to the second floor
and run away!</i>

1174
01:00:08,019 --> 01:00:12,684
[When he almost won... run away?]

1175
01:00:14,441 --> 01:00:17,695
All I had to do was pull off the name tag,
but you suddenly ordered me to run.

1176
01:00:17,696 --> 01:00:21,567
[His nickname is Kwang-vatar, but he
didn't even get the chance to play...]

1177
01:00:22,018 --> 01:00:24,967
[Avatar In Gwon already having
ousted two players.]

1178
01:00:25,996 --> 01:00:29,113
- It's a girl.
- It's Ji Hyo! Don't give her any breaks!

1179
01:00:29,114 --> 01:00:31,654
- It's okay!
- Ji Hyo's really good.

1180
01:00:31,655 --> 01:00:33,672
Call out In Gwon's name.

1181
01:00:33,673 --> 01:00:36,468
Call out In Gwon's name,
and go look for him.

1182
01:00:36,970 --> 01:00:38,712
In Gwon!

1183
01:00:39,611 --> 01:00:42,901
- In Gwon!
- Ji Hyo's a great actress too.

1184
01:00:43,844 --> 01:00:46,206
- There's In Gwon.
- I see him.

1185
01:00:46,207 --> 01:00:48,686
Second floor.
He's up on the second floor.

1186
01:00:49,571 --> 01:00:51,539
He's up on the second floor.
Go up to the second floor.

1187
01:00:52,335 --> 01:00:54,297
Go up to the second floor.
Call out to him.

1188
01:00:54,298 --> 01:00:56,058
Kim In Gwon!

1189
01:00:56,291 --> 01:00:59,124
I think she's going to come up the stairs.
You have to be careful.

1190
01:00:59,125 --> 01:01:00,497
In Gwon!

1191
01:01:00,498 --> 01:01:02,902
[Heading up the stairs
where In Gwon is hiding.]

1192
01:01:02,903 --> 01:01:04,632
Stay hidden in the stairwell.

1193
01:01:04,633 --> 01:01:08,541
[She's approaching!
Hide up the stairs, then ambush her!]

1194
01:01:08,542 --> 01:01:10,730
- Wait, In Gwon.
- She's coming up behind you!

1195
01:01:10,731 --> 01:01:12,416
She's right behind you!
Right behind you!

1196
01:01:13,470 --> 01:01:15,345
- Run back down!
- Run down the steps!

1197
01:01:15,346 --> 01:01:17,055
Run back down the stairs!

1198
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:20,332
- I think we need to do something.
- Director Ha Ha...

1199
01:01:20,826 --> 01:01:23,992
Director Ha Ha?
Ha Ha is the director?

1200
01:01:24,688 --> 01:01:26,055
Oh my God!

1201
01:01:26,056 --> 01:01:27,336
Don't even respond to her.

1202
01:01:27,337 --> 01:01:30,621
Roll out your tongue at her.
Start right now.

1203
01:01:30,656 --> 01:01:32,912
Roll out your tongue at her.

1204
01:01:33,681 --> 01:01:37,042
[Obeying his orders so well.]

1205
01:01:37,043 --> 01:01:38,662
What are you doing?

1206
01:01:40,307 --> 01:01:41,929
Should I tell her to smack him?

1207
01:01:44,085 --> 01:01:47,330
Slap In Gwon.
Slap In Gwon in the face.

1208
01:01:47,331 --> 01:01:49,822
[Slap In Gwon on the face!]

1209
01:01:54,092 --> 01:01:56,006
[I was ordered to do it.
Sorry...]

1210
01:01:56,007 --> 01:01:59,190
Since you've been slapped on the left,
stick out your right cheek.

1211
01:01:59,191 --> 01:02:01,103
Stick out your right cheek.

1212
01:02:01,104 --> 01:02:04,041
- Tell her to slap your other cheek.
- Slap my other cheek.

1213
01:02:04,042 --> 01:02:05,646
- The moment she slaps you, rip it off.
- Slap him again.

1214
01:02:11,240 --> 01:02:14,174
[The headquarters is to
blame for this nonsense.]

1215
01:02:14,175 --> 01:02:16,590
Say it very firmly,
'Hey, Song Ji Hyo!'

1216
01:02:17,140 --> 01:02:18,790
Hey, Song Ji Hyo!

1217
01:02:19,443 --> 01:02:21,389
Let's do this!

1218
01:02:22,142 --> 01:02:23,691
Should we bring her down?

1219
01:02:23,692 --> 01:02:26,807
Start retreating backwards.

1220
01:02:26,808 --> 01:02:29,013
[Director Kyung Gyu telling her to
backtrack back down to the first floor.]

1221
01:02:30,541 --> 01:02:31,670
She's leaving.

1222
01:02:31,671 --> 01:02:32,740
She's leaving.

1223
01:02:35,312 --> 01:02:38,483
- Run after her and eliminate her!
- Do it now!

1224
01:02:38,484 --> 01:02:40,018
Run after her and eliminate her!

1225
01:02:40,019 --> 01:02:42,004
Now's your chance!
Run!

1226
01:02:42,005 --> 01:02:44,565
He's coming!
Hide!

1227
01:02:44,566 --> 01:02:46,046
Stick to the wall right now!

1228
01:02:47,084 --> 01:02:48,233
Eliminate him!

1229
01:02:48,233 --> 01:02:50,088
Where did they go?

1230
01:02:52,509 --> 01:02:57,095
[A blind spot... all they can
hear is a shuffling noise.]

1231
01:03:00,749 --> 01:03:03,163
[Blank-vatar's ambush attack!]

1232
01:03:06,598 --> 01:03:09,068
[Her hand is on his name tag!]

1233
01:03:12,786 --> 01:03:17,244
[Blank-vatar eliminates Avatar In Gwon!]

1234
01:03:17,245 --> 01:03:19,659
- What happened?
- Avatar Kim In Gwon, out.

1235
01:03:19,660 --> 01:03:22,456
<i>Avatar Kim In Gwon, out.</i>

1236
01:03:22,457 --> 01:03:25,049
She did it!
That's our Song Ji Hyo!

1237
01:03:25,050 --> 01:03:27,924
[Ji Hyo's our ace.
An ace is an ace!]

1238
01:03:28,686 --> 01:03:30,633
<i>Avatar Kim In Gwon, out.</i>

1239
01:03:30,634 --> 01:03:34,305
- Send in the next player.
- What do I do? I'm so scared!

1240
01:03:34,306 --> 01:03:36,278
[Blue Team's Hyun Kyung Avatar going in.]

1241
01:03:36,279 --> 01:03:38,520
I saw the way you played dodge ball earlier.
It's okay, you can do it.

1242
01:03:38,521 --> 01:03:42,033
[A imminent face-off between
the female avatars.]

1243
01:03:42,034 --> 01:03:44,328
How in the world does Ji Hyo do it?

1244
01:03:45,013 --> 01:03:48,378
Where's their headquarters?
Should we attack their headquarters?

1245
01:03:49,113 --> 01:03:52,815
Let's go attack their headquarters.

1246
01:03:53,715 --> 01:03:54,905
Yes.

1247
01:03:54,906 --> 01:03:59,253
Go find their headquarters and eliminate
whomever comes out immediately.

1248
01:03:59,254 --> 01:04:00,976
I think it's on the
second floor somewhere.

1249
01:04:02,181 --> 01:04:03,723
I wonder who it'll be?

1250
01:04:04,270 --> 01:04:07,375
- I think someone's coming.
- She's lying in wait for you.

1251
01:04:07,376 --> 01:04:09,249
- She's right up against the wall.
- There she is to the right.

1252
01:04:09,250 --> 01:04:12,805
[The two avatars closing in on each other.]

1253
01:04:13,358 --> 01:04:16,884
- I know that you're behind that wall.
- Watch out! She's right there!

1254
01:04:16,885 --> 01:04:18,636
Back up against the wall!

1255
01:04:18,637 --> 01:04:20,232
She's right there.
They see each other.

1256
01:04:20,233 --> 01:04:21,535
- Hello.
- Hello.

1257
01:04:22,029 --> 01:04:23,411
Ryu Hyun Kyung...

1258
01:04:23,412 --> 01:04:24,910
Scream.
Scream right now.

1259
01:04:24,911 --> 01:04:26,263
Nice.

1260
01:04:30,614 --> 01:04:32,331
Start dancing.
Break out into a sudden dance.

1261
01:04:33,152 --> 01:04:36,005
[Ordering her to start
dancing out of the blue.]

1262
01:04:36,006 --> 01:04:39,498
[She's actually doing it?]

1263
01:04:43,266 --> 01:04:47,012
[Trying to figure out the reasons
behind her sudden dance moves.]

1264
01:04:47,013 --> 01:04:49,216
She's trying to entice you to attack her.

1265
01:04:49,217 --> 01:04:51,027
That conniving wench.

1266
01:04:52,290 --> 01:04:55,435
- Approach her... 'Who do you think you are?'
- Who do you think you are!

1267
01:04:56,037 --> 01:04:59,107
- I'm a dancing machine!
- I'm a dancing machine!

1268
01:05:02,056 --> 01:05:04,523
[Happy]

1269
01:05:05,549 --> 01:05:07,825
Turn around from her quickly.

1270
01:05:07,826 --> 01:05:09,441
Do a sudden turnaround.

1271
01:05:10,756 --> 01:05:12,350
- Like this?
- Turn around her.

1272
01:05:12,905 --> 01:05:14,399
Go behind Hyun Kyung right now.

1273
01:05:15,165 --> 01:05:17,913
[Director Kyung Gyu starting
to show his frustration.]

1274
01:05:18,449 --> 01:05:20,267
Rip it off!
Just rip it off right now!

1275
01:05:21,714 --> 01:05:23,191
- Just rip it off!
- Stand still!

1276
01:05:23,506 --> 01:05:25,905
[Hyun Kyung avatar shoves her back!]

1277
01:05:29,289 --> 01:05:31,493
[Completely satisfied with
Hyun Kyung avatar's brute strength.]

1278
01:05:32,270 --> 01:05:34,962
Eliminate her!
You can't get shoved around!

1279
01:05:36,064 --> 01:05:38,497
Ji Hyo... that hurts.
Please, that hurts.

1280
01:05:41,380 --> 01:05:44,125
[And like ace, Ji Hyo turns her body around
and avoids the attack.]

1281
01:05:45,131 --> 01:05:47,389
That was good.
Relax and show her another dance.

1282
01:05:47,390 --> 01:05:50,286
[As long as the director says...]

1283
01:05:53,412 --> 01:05:54,819
There you go.

1284
01:05:54,820 --> 01:05:57,748
- There you go.
- Enough. She's getting tired out.

1285
01:05:58,318 --> 01:06:00,936
Ji Hyo, listen carefully.
Listen to me carefully.

1286
01:06:01,975 --> 01:06:03,504
Listen carefully.
Listen to me carefully.

1287
01:06:06,144 --> 01:06:07,980
[What is she planning?]

1288
01:06:10,685 --> 01:06:12,483
Like this...

1289
01:06:13,140 --> 01:06:14,247
[What?]

1290
01:06:14,248 --> 01:06:16,542
[What is she doing to her
own name tag?]

1291
01:06:20,241 --> 01:06:23,795
[Blank-vatar self terminates herself?]

1292
01:06:24,662 --> 01:06:25,865
What the heck?

1293
01:06:27,385 --> 01:06:30,757
[What kind of a plan is this?]

1294
01:06:31,547 --> 01:06:33,345
Listen carefully.
Listen to me carefully.

1295
01:06:33,346 --> 01:06:37,345
Rip off the name tag on your back,
and give it to her.

1296
01:06:37,346 --> 01:06:38,435
What?

1297
01:06:38,436 --> 01:06:43,085
Give it to her, and once you do,
Jae Suk is going to go out immediately.

1298
01:06:43,086 --> 01:06:46,007
[Jae Suk avatar to go out immediately,
and spring an ambush attack.]

1299
01:06:46,484 --> 01:06:47,740
Like this.

1300
01:06:47,741 --> 01:06:49,046
Go.

1301
01:06:50,028 --> 01:06:51,491
[Jae Suk avatar makes his way in!]

1302
01:06:51,492 --> 01:06:52,980
Like this...

1303
01:06:52,981 --> 01:06:54,855
He just told her to self-terminate.

1304
01:06:54,856 --> 01:06:57,688
I think he ordered her to do it because
Jae Suk is going right in.

1305
01:06:58,402 --> 01:07:00,440
[Rushing to make her escape
out of fear.]

1306
01:07:02,029 --> 01:07:03,788
I don't think you should go that way.

1307
01:07:03,789 --> 01:07:05,383
I don't think you should go that way.

1308
01:07:06,626 --> 01:07:09,249
[Hi!]

1309

they're trying for...]

- That was amazing!

1417
01:15:33,522 --> 01:15:36,222
- I thought I was at a concert.
- That was unbelievable.

1418
01:15:36,223 --> 01:15:41,756

was because all these people came to help us.

1419
01:15:41,757 --> 01:15:43,413
- Thank you!
- Aren't you going to help us?

1420
01:15:43,414 --> 01:15:46,476
I bet the power for each song
is different.

- That was so cool!
- I can't believe we scored 96 points.

1424
01:15:56,393 --> 01:15:59,418
- Isn't 96 points too high for that song?
- I feel so moved by what just happened.

1425
01:16:01,131 --> 01:16:05,098
[Just because it was cool doesn't mean
that everyone should try it.]

1426

[Next song to be sung by the Blue Team-
Hyun Kyung and In Gwon to sing 'Tears'.]

[The psychic power this time around
is the wire?]

1432
01:16:23,015 --> 01:16:25,252
I'll get on it.
I'm good at riding things like that.

1433
01:16:25,253 --> 01:16:27,239
I really like being on the wire.

1434

[R1- 'Tears'.
How will the wire psychic power work?]

1435

[Having to sing, having to get on the wire...
so much to have to do...]

[How is the wire going to be put to use?]

1442
01:17:14,049 --> 01:17:16,579
[Automatic screaming reaction.]

1443
01:17:22,731 --> 01:17:24,153
[We'll even bring up the monitor for you.]

1444
01:17:28,182 --> 01:17:31,197
[Automatically breaking down into a scream
that brings up her voice five octaves higher.]

1445
01:17:46,002 --> 01:17:48,926
- You have to sing the harmony too!
- Is that supposed to help her?

1446
01:17:53,477 --> 01:17:55,665
[A nice and clean finish.]

1447
01:17:55,666 --> 01:17:56,607
You're good!

1448
01:18:01,590 --> 01:18:04,988
[With the automatic screams added in,
they score 98 points!]

1449
01:18:04,989 --> 01:18:07,524
[A very effective psychic power.]

1450
01:18:08,463 --> 01:18:10,425
It makes the screams come out automatically.

1451
01:18:11,575 --> 01:18:14,557
- But we have 'Shabang Shabang'.
- We do have 'Shabang Shabang'.

1452
01:18:14,558 --> 01:18:16,111
[Orange Team's next song is,
'Shabang Shabang' by Park Hyun Bin.]

[Orange Team uses a gold coin song.]

1454
01:18:24,524 --> 01:18:26,036

I feel like I'm watching a real dinner outing.

1458
01:18:35,408 --> 01:18:37,520
They really are two middle aged men.

1459
01:18:38,720 --> 01:18:40,743
[The three employees
accompanying the bosses.]

1460
01:18:49,629 --> 01:18:53,572

1461
01:19:01,691 --> 01:19:06,929
[The original singer...
Park Hyun Bin makes an appearance!]

1462
01:19:06,930 --> 01:19:11,766
[This is what you call psychic power!]

1463
01:19:14,193 --> 01:19:16,009
[We're all set!]

1464
01:19:17,351 --> 01:19:21,035

But it's really exciting.

1472
01:20:11,296 --> 01:20:13,299
Don't you just want to break
out into a dance?

1473
01:20:14,792 --> 01:20:18,328
[If you're excited,
then join us in the dance!]

1474
01:20:30,110 --> 01:20:33,880
[Hyun Bin toying with his audience.]

1475
01:20:54,658 --> 01:20:58,209
[The king of trot brings the stage to life!]

1476
01:21:02,788 --> 01:21:05,070
[The power of the original singer's power-
99 points!]

1477
01:21:05,071 --> 01:21:06,781
If you're done singing, then leave!

1478
01:21:07,394 --> 01:21:10,216
- Why are you back here again?
- What's wrong with you guys? That's rude!

1479
01:21:10,216 --> 01:21:13,373
Have I been called in because of
some psychic power of yours?

1480
01:21:14,080 --> 01:21:15,859
I know that he's a very busy man...

1481
01:21:15,860 --> 01:21:18,804
[King of trot, Hyun Bin taking the time out
of his busy schedule to come on the show.]

1482
01:21:18,805 --> 01:21:22,620
[Seeing Hyun Bin make his appearance was
like seeing victory at the end of a battle.]

1483
01:21:22,621 --> 01:21:24,791
The choir coming out earlier,
and now Hyun Bin?

1484
01:21:24,792 --> 01:21:27,047
- This is really amazing.
- Why didn't you come out at first stance?

1485
01:21:27,048 --> 01:21:29,503
- If he had, it would've been a perfect score.
- Yes, it would've been 100 points.

1486
01:21:29,504 --> 01:21:32,816
I wanted to hear Lee Kyung Gyu sing
parts of the song before I came out.

1487
01:21:32,817 --> 01:21:35,475
A round of applause for
our friend, Hyun Bin.

1488
01:21:35,476 --> 01:21:39,379
[Orange Team's savior, Park Hyun Bin!]

1489
01:21:42,722 --> 01:21:44,846
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much.

1490
01:21:45,440 --> 01:21:48,846
[Thank you to Park Hyun Bin for taking
the time out of his busy schedule!]

1491
01:21:48,847 --> 01:21:50,543
Having Hyun Bin come out was
really amazing.

1492
01:21:50,544 --> 01:21:54,034
The really good news is that our
next song is 'Gangnam Style'.

1493
01:21:54,035 --> 01:21:56,305
- You think Psy will come?
- If he does, it's over!

1494
01:22:01,186 --> 01:22:05,013
[He was too busy to make it...]

1495
01:22:05,014 --> 01:22:08,864
[Gangnam Style's psychic power is
electric karaoke room!]

1496
01:22:08,865 --> 01:22:15,630
[Must pedal fast to generate the power to
turn on the karaoke monitor screen.]

1497
01:22:17,978 --> 01:22:23,301
[Must pedal to their death in
order to be able to sing.]

1498
01:22:29,937 --> 01:22:32,844
[Kwang Soo's rage filled pedaling!]

1499
01:22:41,231 --> 01:22:43,019
[Can barely even dance from
the exhaustion.]

1500
01:22:49,832 --> 01:22:53,982
[Switching out the peddler to
Big-nose and Blank Ji.]

1501
01:22:53,983 --> 01:22:55,741
Pedal, Suk Jin!

1502
01:23:02,456 --> 01:23:06,121
[The song's highlight that the whole world
is familiar with by now.]

1503
01:23:09,110 --> 01:23:11,303
You have to do the dance!

1504
01:23:11,304 --> 01:23:12,713
This is the highlight!

1505
01:23:12,714 --> 01:23:14,687
- How can you leave this out?
- What's the point if you leave it out?

1506
01:23:15,723 --> 01:23:18,016
You have to do this part!
- Pedal!

1507
01:23:19,633 --> 01:23:21,486
The chains out of place.

1508
01:23:26,348 --> 01:23:28,236
You guys are ruining it!

1509
01:23:32,636 --> 01:23:33,926
The chain is out of place.

1510
01:23:35,151 --> 01:23:37,767
[Back to pedaling!]

1511
01:23:48,769 --> 01:23:51,411
[The yellow guy into it!]

1512
01:23:52,557 --> 01:23:55,068
[But the music cuts off again.]

1513
01:24:06,757 --> 01:24:08,909
This is the lamest version of this song
I've ever heard.

1514
01:24:08,910 --> 01:24:11,311
[What's the score for this song
with the electric psychic power?]

1515
01:24:13,670 --> 01:24:17,344
- I really wanted to see Jae Suk's dance.
- More than anything else...

1516
01:24:17,345 --> 01:24:20,687
If this is the best I can do, then I
can't even leave the house for two days.

1517
01:24:20,688 --> 01:24:22,626
This is so frustrating.

1518
01:24:23,127 --> 01:24:26,130
All we had to do was keep going at the verse
when it says, 'Oppa is Gangnam style.'

1519
01:24:26,131 --> 01:24:27,686
What was I to do?
I got too exhausted.

1520
01:24:30,377 --> 01:24:34,017
[And the Blue Team follows
with 84 points.]

1521
01:24:34,018 --> 01:24:37,835
[Blue Team's last gold coin song-
A chance to pick their song!]

1522
01:24:37,836 --> 01:24:39,629
Their psychic power isn't about
picking out the song randomly?

1523
01:24:40,290 --> 01:24:41,919
That's what it truly means to pick freely.

1524
01:24:42,655 --> 01:24:44,244
What are you going to sing?

1525
01:24:46,671 --> 01:24:48,702
We're going to sing , 'Romantic cat'.

1526
01:24:48,703 --> 01:24:51,141
- Romantic cat?
- You're singing the musical?

1527
01:24:55,531 --> 01:24:57,849
Sweet little kitty?
What's that?

1528
01:24:57,965 --> 01:25:02,963
[Sung by: Hyung Kyung and
a legion of boys.]

1529
01:25:05,512 --> 01:25:08,625
[Festival lady revving up to
the main event.]

1530
01:25:15,769 --> 01:25:17,494
Byul!

1531
01:25:21,255 --> 01:25:23,315
- Byul!
- Sister-in-law!

1532
01:25:28,910 --> 01:25:33,074
[Hyun Kyung has a nice and clear voice!]

1533
01:25:41,064 --> 01:25:43,104
[About to explode!]

1534
01:25:47,469 --> 01:25:52,177
[A chaotic performance.]

1535
01:25:59,351 --> 01:26:01,875
[In Gwon's knocked out after
running into Kkuk.]

1536
01:26:03,002 --> 01:26:07,069
[Banging into this and that...
Blue Team is just full of energy!]

1537
01:26:10,450 --> 01:26:13,111
[In Gwon breaks out in a scream
from the excitement.]

1538
01:26:22,775 --> 01:26:25,189
[Scream!]

1539
01:26:29,432 --> 01:26:32,432
[Let's do it one more time!]

1540
01:26:32,433 --> 01:26:36,039
[Explosion of energy!]

1541
01:26:46,156 --> 01:26:49,144
[Blue Team's one last burst of energy!]

1542
01:26:56,833 --> 01:26:58,747
- Rock and roll!
- Yeah!

1543
01:26:58,748 --> 01:27:02,144
[Everyone applauding a great performance.]

1544
01:27:02,145 --> 01:27:04,300
- We'll sing one more song.
- Let us sing once more.

1545
01:27:05,206 --> 01:27:11,145
[Current score: Orange Team with 99 points.
What will Blue Team's score be?]

1546
01:27:12,040 --> 01:27:14,297
[What is this response?]

1547
01:27:19,098 --> 01:27:22,095
[Blue Team scores 97 points!]

1548
01:27:22,096 --> 01:27:26,518
[By two point difference,
the Orange Team wins!]

1549
01:27:26,519 --> 01:27:28,027
- We won!
- We did it!

1550
01:27:28,028 --> 01:27:29,732
Great job!

1551
01:27:29,733 --> 01:27:31,215
And unfortunately enough...

1552
01:27:31,216 --> 01:27:33,612
just when In Gwon found his rhythm,
it's all over.

1553
01:27:34,861 --> 01:27:37,977
- I really had a great time today.
- When In Gwon finally found his rhythm.

1554
01:27:37,978 --> 01:27:40,816
You really are the festival lady.

1555
01:27:40,817 --> 01:27:42,499
You were the best.

1556
01:27:44,076 --> 01:27:47,011
[Whatever the case, the ultimate winner of
the psychic karaoke room is, Orange team!]

1557
01:27:47,012 --> 01:27:49,277
[What's the winning prize?]

1558
01:27:52,587 --> 01:27:53,846
This is real gold here.

1559
01:27:53,847 --> 01:27:58,305
[Running Man singing race! A gold trophy!]

1560
01:27:58,306 --> 01:27:59,825
That's awesome.

1561
01:27:59,826 --> 01:28:01,748
- This whole thing is gold?
- No, just this part.

1562
01:28:01,749 --> 01:28:05,875
Why are you always trying to scrape up
all the gold on this show?

1563
01:28:05,876 --> 01:28:07,681
You think Running Man is
your gold shop?

1564
01:28:07,682 --> 01:28:09,427
Thank you!

1565
01:28:09,428 --> 01:28:11,340
Our singing race today...

1566
01:28:11,341 --> 01:28:15,737
Lee Kyung Gyu, Ryu Hyun Kyung,
and Kim In Gwon for coming out...

1567
01:28:15,738 --> 01:28:17,520
We had a great time today
thanks to all three of you.

1568
01:28:17,521 --> 01:28:19,069
We'd all like to thank you once again.
Thank you!

1569
01:28:19,070 --> 01:28:21,059
[Thank you to our guests for coming on the
show and bringing laughter to everyone!]

1570
01:28:21,946 --> 01:28:23,628
Here.

1571
01:28:23,629 --> 01:28:27,728
[Is Kyung Gyu gifting his winning trophy
to Hyun Kyung?]

1572
01:28:27,729 --> 01:28:30,852
[But after a closer look,
we realize he took the gold portion off.]

1573
01:28:31,063 --> 01:28:34,226
