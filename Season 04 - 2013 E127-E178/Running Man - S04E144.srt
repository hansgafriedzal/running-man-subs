I'm sure someone is coming on the show.
I'm sure we'll have a guest, but...

00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:51,160
I was thinking about it on my way here...

36
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:53,680

I keep being reminded of the time when
Hyun Jin came on the show.

00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:33,870

00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,470
Why don't you try going up
against Kim Jong Kook?

117
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:39,140
But Kim Jong Kook...
he's  like a master at what he does.

118
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:42,040
After having watched the show...

119

Do you see how he is right now?

141
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:11,580
Usually...

142
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:15,410

you have to expose yourself.

143

[Having reached exhaustion from his
attempt to flee from everyone.]

163

from the shock of seeing him.]

170
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,750
- Why are you doing this to me?
- This is a race.

171
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:55,710
Do you really need to go this far?

172
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:58,720
I caught you earlier,
but I just caught you again.

173
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,300
I just caught you again.

174
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:02,820
I'm so glad to see you!

175
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:05,100
Well I'm not glad to see you!

176
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:08,260
- I have to get going.
- Seriously!

177
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:10,610
In Pyo, seriously!

178
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:15,020
- Jae Suk... thank you!
- That's how he is!

179
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:17,420
You should've told me that
In Pyo was standing right there!

180
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:20,270
[Yoo Jae Suk - Out!]

181
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:24,570
You should've seen his expression.
His eyebrows were raised like this and...

182
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:26,360
There he is again.

183
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:29,380
- Seriously... why are you being like this?
- Don't be upset.

184
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:32,100
Why are you running around with
your zipper undone like this?

185
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:34,420
[Full of feverish energy!
The Cha fever is now fully unleashed!]

186
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:36,070
- You went easy on me, didn't you?
- What?

187
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:37,510
- You went easy on me, right?
- On you?

188
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,980
Because you were trying to be nice.

189
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:41,850
Yes, In Pyo.
I went easy on you.

190
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:45,380
- I did go easy on you.
- You really are a nice person.

191
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:48,400
I heard that you practically raised
Lee Jung Jae by carrying him around?

192
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:53,390
[A recent article that was all over the news
of piggy-backing Lee Jung Jae around.]

193
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:57,580
Ripping off my name tag is good and all,
but keeping me down with your knees like that...

194
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:59,240
[Jae Suk having lost his pride
and the race simultaneously.]

195
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,340
Thank you.

196
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:03,080
[Always ending things with a 'Thank you'-
Such good manners.]

197
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:05,140
<i>He really doesn't leave anything out.</i>

198
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:10,650
[On the other hand...]

199
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:14,900
All the exercising I've been neglecting...
I'm making up for it here.

200
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:24,360
[Breaking out in laughter
after having seen something?]

201
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,370
- There he is.
- He's coming this way.

202
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:29,090
[Why are they all overreacting so much?]

203
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:34,680
[Wow... Tiger and the Giraffe unite!]

204
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:38,430
- We're taller than you.
- We're taller.

205
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:42,400
[This is their plan of attack for
going up against Jang Hoon?]

206
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:44,170
We're much taller than you right now!

207
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:47,040
- The way I'm seeing this right now...
- You can't get past us.

208
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:52,040
This is the ultimate chance for me to
eliminate Jong Kook right now.

209
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:54,620
- Show him how fast we can be!
- Show him!

210
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:57,670
Show him, Kwang Soo.
Grab him. I know that you can do it.

211
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:59,680
I'm not very interested in Kwang Soo.

212
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,290
- Kwang Soo's really good too.
- You have no idea how formidable I can be!

213
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:03,970
- Hey!
- But...

214
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:07,280
Why is it that as I see Jong Kook's name tag
from the back, my hands are starting to itch?

215
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:10,530
[Mr. Capable's name tag bewitching
his own teammate.]

216
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:12,140
Don't misunderstand my intentions.

217
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:13,820
I think it would be a good idea
to protect your name.

218
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:16,360
Are you playing around right now?
What the heck? Who's doing that?

219
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:19,100
[As expected...]

220
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:21,060
Hey!
Stop it!

221
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:22,800
Hey, you scoundrel!

222
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:27,490
[Impossible to work together due to
the Giraffe's traitorous DNA.]

223
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:29,230
- Stop that, Kwang Soo!
- Jong Kook! Look!

224
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:32,290
[In the midst of this chaos,
Cha In Pyo starts heading their way.]

225
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:34,580
[Attack!]

226
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:40,540
- Long time no see.
- Hello!

227
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:43,960
And Gary, your donation of clothes
to the people in Africa...

228
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:46,390
- You sent several truckloads to my house.
- Seriously?

229
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:48,480
[Gary's act of generosity
that no one was aware of.]

230
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,610
Then I'll stay out of this for now.

231
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:53,240
- Where do you think you're going!
- Alright!

232
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,130
I don't know who's side I should be on!

233
00:12:55,130 --> 00:12:56,270
Jang Hoon, you take Kim Jong Kook!

234
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:57,870
Jang Hoon, you take Kim Jong Kook.

235
00:12:57,870 --> 00:13:01,020
[Pushing Mr. Capable, his toughest enemy
off to Jang Hoon?]

236
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:02,290
I really want to rip that off.

237
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:03,390
Move!

238
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:07,570
[Springs an attack on Gary,
who left his guard down for a split second.]

239
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,440
You fool!

240
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,780
[Ousted in a blink of an eye!]

241
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:16,950
[Gary is very easily ousted!]

242
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:18,740
- I can't believe that happened!
- How did that happen?

243
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,820
Ricky, don't come too close.

244
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:22,480
I...

245
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:25,500
[In the moment everyone seem to
momentarily let down their guard...]

246
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:30,060
[In Pyo seizes the moment they took to
greet each other to attack Ricky!]

247
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,360
[No one is safe in Ricky's eyes!]

248
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,020
[Almost took ten years off his life!]

249
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:38,830
There's no way you can let your guard down.
This is a real battlefield!

250
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:45,670
What was that?

251
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:48,760
[Total chaos where there are
no friend or foes in this battlefield!]

252
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:51,320
[In the meantime...]

253
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:57,310
[Two members of the Traitors Club who've
been staying in hiding from the beginning.]

254
00:13:57,910 --> 00:14:01,110
- Really?
- We can start by eliminating our own members.

255
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:06,850
[False dreams of winning again.]

256
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:10,720
[The only safe way to hug amongst
the Traitors Club members.]

257
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:15,070
- That's our special hug.
- Why do I feel unsafe about being here?

258
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:17,470
I feel nervous too.
Seriously...

259
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:19,870
I feel more nervous being here with you
than I would about being with Cha In Pyo.

260
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:24,070
[Will these two...
be able to pull it off today?]

261
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:27,410
If we join our strengths...

262
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:30,950
I don't think there will be many
who'll be able to beat us.

263
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:33,430
In that case...

264
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,350
[Just then!]

265
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:39,380
[Ro-Ro starts approaching Ricky
from behind!]

266
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:40,540
Actually...

267
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:44,840
It's harder than I thought to keep your
hold on someone, so I lost two people.

268
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,630
There's a method of doing that.

269
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,520
[Attempting to approach through
the break in the window.]

270
00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:54,840
[Kkuk is trying to divert Ricky's attention
elsewhere after having seen Haroro's approach]

271
00:14:57,390 --> 00:14:59,630
So how...

272
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:03,440
[Cover blown]

273
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:04,930
[You dummy!]

274
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:06,030
Suk Jin!

275
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:08,490
[As expected, Big-nose betrays him.]

276
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:13,860
[Big-nose betrays Ro-Ro so that Ricky
doesn't suspect that he's Ro-Ro's ally!]

277
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:15,200
- You're so frustrating.
- Suk Jin!

278
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:19,170
[The promise made between these two
ultimately ends in betrayal yet again.]

279
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:23,090
Let's go up to the rooftop.
Let's all go up to the rooftop.

280
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:25,740
Okay? Let's all just face each other
out in the open space.

281
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:29,190
[In Pyo still overflowing with energy.]

282
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:31,680
[I need water.]

283
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,060
- I have some water here, Ji Hyo.
- No, it's okay, In Pyo.

284
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:37,770
- Just don't come close to me.
- I have some in my bag.

285
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:40,920
- Look at that glint in his eyes!
- His eyes are scaring me!

286
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,480
Look at his eyes!

287
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,170
Jang Hoon, you take care of Mr. Capable.

288
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:49,690
[Ricky ambushes In Pyo!]

289
00:15:52,770 --> 00:15:56,780
[Ricky eliminates In Pyo's name tag!]

290
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:58,620
<i>Ricky Kim!</i>

291
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:01,610
I can't believe you did that to me!
We even rode here together.

292
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:06,990
But... what are we going to do now
that you've ousted In Pyo?

293
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:09,330
There are only two of us left now.

294
00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:10,400
[Cha In Pyo - Out!]

295
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:14,600
- Suk Jin betrayed me and eliminated me.
- Really?

296
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,470
<i>Cha In Pyo, out!</i>

297
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:19,140
In... In Pyo's ousted?

298
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:22,100
- Oh my...
- In Pyo!

299
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:26,320
[Hides away his laser beam eyes,
and timidly enters the jail cell.]

300
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:30,180
- Who ousted you?
- Ricky.

301
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:33,180
- Ricky ousted you?
- I've raised a little tiger.

302
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:40,160
I told Ricky that... there are three
branches to American government.

303
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:44,040
- CIA, FBI and DTA.
- What's DTA?

304
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,940
Don't Trust Anybody.
(DTA)

305
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:48,290
[Don't Trust Anybody]

306
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:53,160
- Now that we're here on Running Man.
- There's a sense of elegance to this man.

307
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:55,080
You're saying that I'm not funny, right?

308
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,870
He just said that I'm not funny, didn't he?

309
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,050
It's not that you're not funny.
But don't you think he's elegant?

310
00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:01,560
Can you show me rage filled
teeth brushing later?

311
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:05,470
- In Pyo doesn't do things like that.
- Oh yeah, I forgot about that.

312
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:07,720
In my attempt to brush my teeth like that,
one of my teeth broke off.

313
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,680
I had to get a dental implant.

314
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:12,850
Air always leaks through there.

315
00:17:12,850 --> 00:17:16,600
[Stay tuned for this man's black hole-like
charm that will enrapture you today.]

316
00:17:18,090 --> 00:17:22,660
[Only one door left acting as a barrier
between Ricky and the rest of the members.]

317
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:23,960
You go out first.

318
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:26,140
Go ahead.

319
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:31,550
[The original Mr. Capable
Jong Kook makes his move!]

320
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:34,310
- There they go.
- Really?

321
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:35,940
[Immediately faces off with each other!]

322
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:37,850
Shut the door.
Just shut the door on them.

323
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:42,240
[A battle between the two men.]

324
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:45,080
[Strength vs. Strength.]

325
00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:48,920
[Getting flustered over the strength
shown by Mr. Capable.]

326
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:58,040
[He rips it off!]

327
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,710
- Who ripped it off?
- Ricky's been ousted.

328
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:08,540
[At the end of a very close fight,
Ricky Kim is ousted!]

329
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:14,510
[Flustered by Ricky's elimination,
Jang Joon starts to back away.]

330
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,050
- You're really going?
- Where are you going?

331
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:18,270
- I'm going home early. This is exhausting.
- Where are you going?

332
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:20,870
- Jang Hoon...
- I've been too sedentary since my retirement.

we can attack both the upper
and lower extremities together.

short stature, wouldn't that just be average?

00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:47,630
- Round one!
- Where? Where is it?

661
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:49,000
[Arriving at 'R1'.]

662
00:36:50,690 --> 00:36:53,130
[Other teams are starting to arrive
behind them one by one.]

663
00:36:53,130 --> 00:36:55,350
I think I see something up there.

664
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:58,700
- What is it?
- This is the 'R1' mark.

665
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:02,210
The game you'll be playing here
is the absolute pitch game.

666
00:37:02,210 --> 00:37:03,430
Absolute pitch?

667
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:05,570
You know that I'm a singer, don't you?

668
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:09,500
Both members have to say the phrase given in
the right pitch and pronunciation in 30 sec.

669
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:11,510
- One person at a time?
- Yes, one person at a time.

670
00:37:11,510 --> 00:37:13,490
- You'll have 30 seconds.
- In higher octave?

671
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:16,490
- Are we going to be reading something?
- What is it?

672
00:37:16,490 --> 00:37:17,760
I don't know either.

673
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,070
- I'll go first.
- Okay.

674
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:21,190
[Gary and Ji Hyo- Challenge.]

675
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:23,130
Set, go.

677
00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:32,560
- Chuncheon chapssal het chamcham...
- Hey!

678
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,370
How am I supposed to do this?

679
00:37:39,410 --> 00:37:42,660
[Current singer getting his tongue twisted
around by the pronunciation and pitch.]

680
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:02,470
[Fail]

681
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,830
- That's really hard.
- So this is how the new order is.

682
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:06,700
- I'll go first.
- Okay.

683
00:38:07,130 --> 00:38:08,570
[Must head to the next location
if the mission is failed.]

684
00:38:08,570 --> 00:38:11,710
- But Ricky is...
- I came from America.

685
00:38:11,710 --> 00:38:14,410
- Can you give me an English phrase?
- Give him an English phrase.

686
00:38:14,410 --> 00:38:16,590
<i>Your team will have a full minute.</i>

687
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:17,640
- Really?
- We get a minute.

688
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:21,940
- I'm really good at this game.
- Why are they getting a minute?

689
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:23,820
Why is this team getting a minute?

690
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:25,230
- Because he's from America.
- He's from America.

691
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:27,280
- What kind of a rule is that?
- Then you do it in English!

692
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,570
I'll give you a minute, so do it in English!

693
00:38:28,570 --> 00:38:29,940
Okay, I'll move on.

694
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:30,960
[Okay... that's what we thought.]

695
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:36,680
<i>You have to get going to
your next location.</i>

696
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:38,240
- Are they leaving already?
- What's going on, Gary?

697
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:39,450
- You're leaving already?
- Yes.

698
00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:41,010
You have to head to your next location
if you fail the mission here.

699
00:38:41,010 --> 00:38:42,440
- Really?
- You have to do a good job.

700
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:44,580
There are still a lot of people here.

701
00:38:45,090 --> 00:38:46,780
Me first?
Should I go first?

702
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:48,330
- You go first.
- I'll go first.

703
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:50,090

He's not going to get it.

[Oh?]

708
00:39:07,390 --> 00:39:09,650
[As predicted, a difficult game for Ricky.]

709
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:17,470
- You're not going to get it.
- Anyone who can read can do this.

710
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:21,120
[But he's over here failing repeatedly...]

711
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,560
Keep it down!

712
00:39:29,210 --> 00:39:30,600
You said 'gul ddeuk'.

713

You're not good at this.

714
00:39:35,050 --> 00:39:37,210
- You're pretty bad at this.
- No way they're going to get this.

715
00:39:37,210 --> 00:39:38,570
You know this game, right, Jang Hoon?

716
00:39:39,870 --> 00:39:42,190
[Total concentration.]

717
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:46,860
[Not much time left on the clock!]

718
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:48,740
I got it the first time around.

719
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:50,920
- You didn't succeed.
- Time's up.

720
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:53,000
[Fail]

721
00:39:53,870 --> 00:39:55,740
Everyone try this then.

722
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:58,050
- Make them all try this.
- Why would we do that?

723
00:39:58,050 --> 00:39:59,900
- You all give this one a try.
- Just get going on your way.

724
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:03,120
- Just go on your own way.
- Go and leave us be.

725
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:05,110
- You have to get going on your way.
- Seriously!

726
00:40:05,730 --> 00:40:07,410
- Seriously!
- Get going, Mister.

727
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:19,760
- Ddukbokki.
- Ddukbokki!

728
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:27,180
It's so good!

729
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:28,600
Even though playing the game
is important

730
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:32,380
it's not good manners to be solely playing
the games while at a place like this.

731
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:33,920
[Gary's word of wisdom-
Games can wait until after a good meal.]

732
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:36,870
Team Hoon-two.

Jang Hoon, where are you going?

735
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:44,880
- I'm really getting sick of you.
- What are you saying?

736
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:47,900
- I'm getting sick of you.
- Why aren't you doing it?

737

[Big and tall brother getting sick and tired
of the little kiddo.]

738
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:52,420
I feel so bad for Jang Hoon.
Why did you give him such small clothing?

739
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:54,680
His jacket looks like a
belly shirt on him.

740
00:40:54,690 --> 00:40:58,250
- Give him a triple XL or something.
- Who wears belly shirts anymore these days?

741
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,490
Get us a new bike for him too
while you're at it.

742
00:41:00,490 --> 00:41:04,490
- Tidy Pyo is getting really antsy.
- I know. Let's get going.

743
00:41:04,490 --> 00:41:06,560
If he doesn't start playing soon, he's
going to start asking me questions again.

- They succeeded?

their stickers from having succeeded.]

- Stick that on, and be on your way.

00:42:24,870 --> 00:42:27,530
It's because of my implant.
I can't get the pronunciation.

767
00:42:27,530 --> 00:42:28,810
Why are you saying anything
about an implant?

in the midst of playing the game.]

talking about the implant for so long.]

We only had 30 seconds,
but we talked about the implant.

We'll acknowledge that.
We did talk about the implant.

- I will give them a break on that.
- No, we can't do that.

It's because we couldn't get
this peeled.

00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:47,990
I bit my tooth.

825
00:45:47,990 --> 00:45:49,920
Are you okay?
Is it your implant?

826
00:45:58,820 --> 00:46:00,520
- Are we good? We succeeded, right?
- You failed.

827
00:46:00,550 --> 00:46:01,840
Why?

828
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:02,880
Is your implant okay?

829
00:46:02,890 --> 00:46:06,860
[That aside, the real worry is Tidy Pyo...]

830
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:13,190
Since there are people following behind us,
we have to get there really fast.

831
00:46:13,190 --> 00:46:16,320
- Let's hurry and succeed the next mission.
- Okay!

832
00:46:17,490 --> 00:46:19,930
We have to hurry!

833
00:46:25,340 --> 00:46:27,120
It's really far.

834
00:46:27,740 --> 00:46:30,320
Even though the scenery is nice,
we don't have the chance to enjoy the view!

835
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:34,020
- I think we're losing bad.
- Yes, In Pyo.

836
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:36,980
- You can pretty much bet on coming in last.
- But you're Yoo-ruce Willis.

837
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:39,750
- That has nothing to do with this.
- When is Yoo-ruce Willis coming out?

838
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:42,960
- That's not every day.
- Only during water gun fights?

839
00:46:42,970 --> 00:46:44,470
- That's Yoo-ames Bond.
- Ah.

840
00:46:45,250 --> 00:46:48,580
- And who's Yoo-hyuk?
- Yoo-hyuk, that guy is...

841
00:46:48,860 --> 00:46:51,090
He comes out once in awhile
when there's dancing involved.

842
00:46:51,090 --> 00:46:54,830
So you're Yoo-ruce Willis, Yoo-ames Bond,
Yoo-hyuk and I'm Tidy Pyo?

843
00:46:54,830 --> 00:46:56,190
Yes, you're Tidy Pyo.

844
00:46:56,190 --> 00:46:57,780
I guess that's fair?

845
00:46:58,970 --> 00:47:01,550
- I want something cool too.
- You need one too.

846
00:47:01,550 --> 00:47:03,280
I don't want anything like the Cha-minator.

847
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:04,820
[Cha-minator?]

848
00:47:04,820 --> 00:47:07,610
That's pretty good.
Cha-minator suits you.

849
00:47:08,260 --> 00:47:11,520
- Cham-bo?
- How did you know I was thinking that?

850
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:13,970
- I don't like that.
- I was going to call you Cham-bo!

851
00:47:14,310 --> 00:47:16,130
Cha-perman is pretty decent.

852
00:47:16,130 --> 00:47:17,860
Cha-perman!

853
00:47:18,510 --> 00:47:20,370
Cha-perman!
You can be the Cha-perman!

854
00:47:20,370 --> 00:47:23,830
- You do seem like a superman.
- Cha-perman!

855
00:47:23,830 --> 00:47:26,440
[Cha-perman.]

856
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:30,480
- Just where in the world is the next one?
- My legs are hurting!

857
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:32,840
Can we stop now?

858
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:35,150
Why is the fourth one so far away?

859
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,150
There it is.

860
00:47:37,150 --> 00:47:38,980
[Gary and Blank Ji succeeds at 'R3'
and arrives at 'R4'.]

861
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:40,630
We're here.

862
00:47:42,820 --> 00:47:44,310
What is this?

863
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:47,960
- You know what this is, right?
- Cookie stick.

864
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:49,450
Yes, it's a cookie stick.

865
00:47:49,460 --> 00:47:54,050
['R4' mission- Must eat the cookie down to
1.5cm within 30 seconds to succeed!]

866
00:47:54,050 --> 00:47:55,420
Do we only have one chance
to do this?

867
00:47:55,420 --> 00:47:58,630
- Hang on. I need some lip-gloss first.
- Why are you putting that on?

868
00:47:58,630 --> 00:48:00,610
Why are you putting that on?

869
00:48:01,070 --> 00:48:03,950
- It's because my lips are dry right now.
- I need some water too.

870
00:48:03,950 --> 00:48:05,080
Here it is.

871
00:48:05,430 --> 00:48:07,860
We can do it more than once
within those 30 seconds?

872
00:48:07,860 --> 00:48:09,850
<i>You just need to succeed
within 30 seconds.</i>

873
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:12,560
- Here.
- The opposite way.

874
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:13,810
I have to eat the chocolate?

875
00:48:13,810 --> 00:48:16,010
Let's do this the first time.
Let's succeed in our first try.

876
00:48:16,010 --> 00:48:17,860
- One try, okay?
- Okay.

877
00:48:17,860 --> 00:48:20,190
We've already done this before.
Hang on.

878
00:48:20,190 --> 00:48:22,940
We've already done this before,
but I'm feeling nervous again.

879
00:48:22,940 --> 00:48:25,860
This is driving me crazy.
Why am I getting so nervous?

880
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:29,110
Let's get this done in one shot.

881
00:48:29,110 --> 00:48:32,360
- Set, go!
- This is no big deal.

882
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:41,990
We don't mess around with
this game anymore.

883
00:48:41,990 --> 00:48:43,620
- Success!
- Yeah!

884
00:48:43,620 --> 00:48:47,130
- There's barely anything left!
- We're not embarrassed by this.

885
00:48:47,130 --> 00:48:48,500
[Gary and Blank Ji succeeding
with their first attempt.]

886
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:50,140
Yes!

887
00:48:54,020 --> 00:48:57,770
- I don't think any other teams can do this.
- How are other teams going to do this?

888
00:48:58,460 --> 00:48:59,950
- You're not...
- This can't be?

889
00:49:01,170 --> 00:49:02,630
1.5cm.

890
00:49:02,630 --> 00:49:04,760
It has to be 1.5cm or less, right?

891
00:49:05,630 --> 00:49:09,680
- You've got 30 seconds to do the mission.
- I'm not prepared for this yet.

892
00:49:11,570 --> 00:49:12,750
Seriously...

893
00:49:12,750 --> 00:49:14,290
Is this your first time?

894
00:49:15,170 --> 00:49:18,170
- Is this your first time with another man?
- This is my first time.

895
00:49:18,170 --> 00:49:20,900
- My first time. I'm really...
- In that case...

896
00:49:20,900 --> 00:49:22,880
Why is your face getting red?

897
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:26,470
If you just hold it and stay still,
I'll take the lead.

898
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:29,640
- I'll trust you to do this then.
- Okay.

899
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:31,670
Set, go!

900
00:49:37,390 --> 00:49:38,840
- Hey!
- What!

901
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:40,350
How close are you going to get?

902
00:49:41,780 --> 00:49:43,200
[Another attempt.]

903
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:48,220
[Face is getting red.]

904
00:49:48,220 --> 00:49:51,030
[Totally forward and aggressive?]

905
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:58,490
Is that snot that I just
got in my mouth?

906
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:01,290
<i>Fail!</i>

907
00:50:01,290 --> 00:50:03,250
[Fail...]

908
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:04,920
Is the time over?

909
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:07,170
Let me at least check how long it is.

910
00:50:07,830 --> 00:50:09,550
How are we expected to succeed
this mission?

911
00:50:09,550 --> 00:50:10,660
[More than 3cm in length...]

912
00:50:11,110 --> 00:50:13,590
Why were your lips trembling like that?

913
00:50:13,590 --> 00:50:16,910
- I was feeling really embarrassed.
- You must've lost your mind.

914
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:20,040
- It's because that was my first time.
- Do you like me or something?

915
00:50:21,850 --> 00:50:23,220
Suk Jin...

916
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:25,810
- It's over.
- I think it's over.

917
00:50:25,810 --> 00:50:27,160
Let's hurry up and go.

918
00:50:28,230 --> 00:50:29,970
All these gnats...

919
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:33,790
[Jang Hoon, who doesn't like to be bothered
is getting beleaguered by gnats.]

920
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:37,660
You should've been dancing
like that back there!

921
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:49,860
I think there were pictures
taken of us on the rail.

922
00:50:51,780 --> 00:50:54,070
- Thank you.
- This is going to be a lifelong memory.

923
00:50:54,070 --> 00:50:56,230
Thank you.
We're both frowning in the picture.

924
00:50:56,830 --> 00:50:58,400
Seo Jang Hoon!

925
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:02,410
Did you have to pass through
an army of gnats back there too?

926
00:51:02,410 --> 00:51:04,280
Did you see all the gnats back there?

927
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:06,260
- You didn't get any in your mouths?
- We succeeded our mission.

928
00:51:06,260 --> 00:51:08,490
- Gnats?
- An army of gnats!

929
00:51:08,490 --> 00:51:12,090
- Wow... your picture came out nice.
- I wonder what I was glaring at.

930
00:51:12,090 --> 00:51:15,780
Your picture came out really nice.
You look very charismatic in the picture.

931
00:51:16,090 --> 00:51:18,860
I just have my eyes opened.

932
00:51:29,590 --> 00:51:32,680
These are the steps where you'll be
playing basketball with your shoes.

933
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:36,510
- Basketball with our shoes?
- Do you see the yellow heart up there?

934
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:41,100
The team with the most number of shoes
in that yellow zone wins the game.

935
00:51:41,100 --> 00:51:43,670
Even if it's grazing the line,
we will accept that for a point.

936
00:51:43,670 --> 00:51:45,550
- That little heart up there?
- The yellow heart.

937
00:51:45,550 --> 00:51:47,110
- The yellow heart.
- The one way up there?

938
00:51:47,110 --> 00:51:50,680
- That's impossible!
- Our writer landed five in there earlier.

939
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:52,930
- No way!
- That's absurd!

940
00:51:52,930 --> 00:51:55,120
- Show us a video proof.
- I'm trying to help you be more comfortable.

941
00:51:55,120 --> 00:51:57,350
- You think this is comfortable?
- I'm giving you a chin rest.

942
00:51:57,890 --> 00:52:01,050
All those stickers that you've gathered by
succeeding your missions?

943
00:52:01,050 --> 00:52:04,620
Depending on the number of those stickers,
we will give you extra shoes.

944
00:52:04,620 --> 00:52:06,900
You all have the shoes you're wearing
to play the game with

945
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:09,590
and as many extra shoes as the number
of the stickers that you've won.

946
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:11,070
What about us?

947
00:52:11,070 --> 00:52:13,570
[Jae Suk and In Pyo who didn't succeed
at winning any stickers.]

948
00:52:13,570 --> 00:52:16,460
In Pyo has hard time seeing,
and he also has an implant.

949
00:52:16,460 --> 00:52:18,390
Don't you think he needs to be
compensated for that somehow?

950
00:52:18,390 --> 00:52:21,000
If he has such a hard time seeing,
why has been glaring like this the whole time?

951
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:24,820
It's because he has a hard time seeing!
It's making me get teary eyed right now.

952
00:52:24,820 --> 00:52:25,900
Are any parts of him normal?

953
00:52:25,900 --> 00:52:28,800
The reason why In Pyo's glare is like that...

954
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:31,820
It's not because he's fierce,
but it's because he has bad vision.

955
00:52:32,220 --> 00:52:35,070
Jang Hoon apparently burned his hand on the
potato and he had to show it to me.

956
00:52:35,070 --> 00:52:37,030
He showed off his fingers to me
and told me he burned his fingers.

957
00:52:37,030 --> 00:52:38,400
You can't use excuses like that.

958
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:41,020
You know what he kept saying to the
staff members earlier?

959
00:52:41,030 --> 00:52:43,160
He asked if the staff members deliberately
brought in the gnats to bother him.

960
00:52:43,730 --> 00:52:46,740
[Adorable grumbler who's dissatisfied
even with the state of nature.]

961
00:52:46,740 --> 00:52:50,000
It's because the gnats were only
in that small area.

962
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,030
I'm embarrassed to be going around
with him as my partner now.

963
00:52:53,150 --> 00:52:54,940
Does everyone understand the rules?

964
00:52:54,940 --> 00:52:56,350
- Yes.
- Yes.

965
00:52:56,350 --> 00:52:59,410
[Suk Jin and Kwang Soo to start off
the game with their two stickers each.]

966
00:52:59,410 --> 00:53:00,570
Challenge!

967
00:53:00,570 --> 00:53:02,780
- I think we can do this.
- Lets do this!

968
00:53:09,930 --> 00:53:11,820
You've still got it, Ji Suk Jin!

969
00:53:17,830 --> 00:53:21,020
[Sends it flying off in the right direction!]

970
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:24,180
[Fail]

971
00:53:26,430 --> 00:53:27,800
- Kwang Soo!
- Challenge!

972
00:53:28,890 --> 00:53:32,570
Lee Kwang Soo!
Lee Kwang Soo!

973
00:53:32,580 --> 00:53:35,320
<i>Lee Kwang Soo!
Lee Kwang Soo!</i>

974
00:53:36,540 --> 00:53:38,270
[A chant that dies off quickly.]

975
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:40,230
It certainly doesn't last long
like it did overseas.

976
00:53:40,230 --> 00:53:42,120
- It's like those gnats.
- Why do you keep saying that?

977
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:44,370
[The crowd is already settled down.]

978
00:53:47,370 --> 00:53:49,850
- Challenge!
- He's blessed by the variety gods though.

979
00:53:49,850 --> 00:53:51,750
- I bet he'll do something.
- Sorry!

980
00:53:52,290 --> 00:53:53,900
I heard that it's a lie.

981
00:53:58,620 --> 00:54:01,310
[Giraffe becoming victim to
Yoo-hyuk's joking around.]

982
00:54:01,310 --> 00:54:05,090
People over there were cheering you on,
and people over here called them out on it.

983
00:54:05,090 --> 00:54:07,380
- Why did you have to tell me that?
- You should know the truth!

984
00:54:09,220 --> 00:54:12,330
[Giraffe loses his drive,
and fails at his first attempt.]

985
00:54:12,330 --> 00:54:14,000
Don't block the camera.

986
00:54:15,610 --> 00:54:18,250
- One more time.
- Let's go.

987
00:54:24,180 --> 00:54:27,230
[Kicking off the shoe with all his might.]

988
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:30,580
[It's flying off in the right direction...]

989
00:54:30,580 --> 00:54:33,010
- It's too short.
- Okay, a little bit stronger with the kick.

990
00:54:33,010 --> 00:54:34,610
The kick is too short.

991
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:37,820
- Too short!
- Coming in too short is his constant issue.

992
00:54:38,390 --> 00:54:40,650
- That was too short.
- Being too short is his problem.

993
00:54:40,650 --> 00:54:42,710
- He's always too short.
- Jang Hoon, fighting!

994
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:46,100
<i>- Wow, he's so tall!
- He's so tall!</i>

995
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:48,950
<i>I've never seen anyone
taller than Kwang Soo before!</i>

996
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:52,440
- Jang Hoon is much taller than Kwang Soo!
- She said he's taller than Kwang Soo.

997
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:55,570
Kwang Soo does look much shorter
than usual right now.

998
00:54:55,950 --> 00:54:57,250
[Come on...]

999
00:54:57,250 --> 00:54:58,750
Are you joking around right now?

1000
00:55:02,120 --> 00:55:04,160
<i>So cute!</i>

1001
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:07,070
Get out of my way.
You're so exhausting!

1002
00:55:09,190 --> 00:55:11,540
He tells him to get out of his way,
and said he's annoying.

1003
00:55:11,540 --> 00:55:13,620
It's not the game that's exhausting,
but you're the one exhausting me.

1004
00:55:16,570 --> 00:55:18,460
- Here I go!
- You know what his nickname used to be?

1005
00:55:18,460 --> 00:55:19,570
[Kkuk's turn at the challenge.]

1006
00:55:19,980 --> 00:55:21,000
His nickname used to be poop fly.

1007
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,990
[The shoe is in the air!]

1008
00:55:27,610 --> 00:55:29,270
[Now if it'll just roll down one step!]

1009
00:55:29,270 --> 00:55:32,480
[Ah...]

1010
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:34,660
- That's too bad.
- I thought you had it for sure.

1011
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:39,130
- Challenge.
- In Pyo!

1012
00:55:39,130 --> 00:55:40,820
[Cha-perman Tidy Pyo's turn.]

1013
00:55:41,230 --> 00:55:44,900
[The music that we're reminded of
whenever that glint is seen in his eyes.]

1014
00:55:45,990 --> 00:55:49,290
[Just like that fierce glint in
his eyes back then...]

1015
00:55:52,710 --> 00:55:56,710
[1994- 'Love is in your embrace'.]

1016
00:55:56,710 --> 00:55:58,830
I'm getting that feeling again.

1017
00:56:00,910 --> 00:56:07,300
[Imitating him from the scene.]

1018
00:56:10,140 --> 00:56:12,650
[Hm...]

1019
00:56:12,650 --> 00:56:15,990
[Just sends it flying off into the air
without any direction...]

1020
00:56:17,860 --> 00:56:20,030
Jong Kook didn't teach me right.

1021
00:56:20,030 --> 00:56:21,830
- Don't do things like that.
- No, I didn't!

1022
00:56:23,830 --> 00:56:25,410
[Yoo-hyuk's turn.]

1023
00:56:25,410 --> 00:56:27,290
Anyone who scores
even one is going to win this.

1024
00:56:27,290 --> 00:56:29,150
This is really a one-time opportunity.

1025
00:56:29,150 --> 00:56:31,950
The best method is to throw it up really high
and have it roll down to the goal.

1026
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:34,030
- I have to hit it above it, right?
- Yeah, throw it above it.

1027
00:56:36,490 --> 00:56:38,790
[Did he do it?]

1028
00:56:43,690 --> 00:56:46,180
[Bounces off the step into
the yellow heart?]

1029
00:56:53,330 --> 00:56:54,770
[Wow!]

1030
00:56:56,380 --> 00:56:57,380
[Success!]

1031
00:56:59,990 --> 00:57:02,010
[Amazing!
Directly in the yellow heart!]

1032
00:57:09,530 --> 00:57:11,210
I did it, In Pyo!

1033
00:57:13,380 --> 00:57:14,900
[Amazing...]

1034
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:19,670
- That's unbelievable!
- The variety gods are with you!

1035
00:57:19,670 --> 00:57:21,830
The variety gods have not abandoned me!

1036
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:25,220
That's unbelievable!

1037
00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:28,660
- That was amazing!
- It landed right in the middle!

1038
00:57:29,550 --> 00:57:30,880
We have to knock it out of there.

1039
00:57:30,890 --> 00:57:33,220
I'm getting nervous now.

1040
00:57:33,850 --> 00:57:35,640
[Will Blank Ji be able to do it?]

1041
00:57:38,230 --> 00:57:39,360
[Fail]

1042
00:57:41,930 --> 00:57:43,210
[Random Mr. Capable Gary also fails.]

1043
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:54,260
[Yoo-hyuk's shoes holding steady.]

1044
00:57:55,750 --> 00:57:57,930
[Last turn with Kwang Soo at the bat.]

1045
00:57:57,930 --> 00:57:59,530
There's no way he's going to
knock that out of the way.

1046
00:58:02,530 --> 00:58:06,200
[No way...]

1047
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:08,370
[Did the variety gods bless him
again today?]

1048
00:58:28,730 --> 00:58:30,270
[Unbelievable-
Almost knocks it out the way!]

1049
00:58:33,270 --> 00:58:36,980
[However with the accurateness of
Yoo-hyuk's landing, he wins the game!]

1050
00:58:36,980 --> 00:58:40,180
[Too bad. He almost knocked it
out of the way...]

1051
00:58:40,180 --> 00:58:42,750
[The battle of the variety gods?
Anxiety ridden final moments.]

1052
00:58:42,750 --> 00:58:44,830
This is something to be proud of!

1053
00:58:45,930 --> 00:58:49,330
[Jae Suk and In Pyo wins!]

1054
00:58:49,330 --> 00:58:51,630
[They win the mysterious envelope!]

1055
00:58:52,550 --> 00:58:56,320
<i>[Go to Namsan's branch school and
find the Running Man landmark.]</i>

1056
00:58:56,320 --> 00:58:58,960
I really hope we get to do something
that requires us to use our strength.

1057
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:02,800
The really important thing is who's left
laughing at the last moment.

1058
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:04,770
- Really?
- We just need to be the last one laughing.

1059
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:07,870
[Arrives at the mission location.]

1060
00:59:08,270 --> 00:59:10,020
[Chuncheon's
Namsan Elementary branch school.]

1061
00:59:11,830 --> 00:59:13,840
[All the separate teams each
arriving at the athletic field.]

1062
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:15,270
- What is this?
- What is this chair for?

1063
00:59:16,230 --> 00:59:17,550
What is this?

1064
00:59:17,550 --> 00:59:18,700
It's marked with the 'R'.

1065
00:59:18,700 --> 00:59:20,250
[What is this one single mystery chair?]

1066
00:59:20,250 --> 00:59:23,570
<i>Your next mission...
is the king's throne game.</i>

1067
00:59:23,570 --> 00:59:25,120
- King's throne?
- That's what we're playing?

1068
00:59:25,120 --> 00:59:27,310
Yes, King's throne.
Do you see the chair in front of you?

1069
00:59:27,730 --> 00:59:31,330
<i>The moment that you hear the whistle
sounding the end</i>

1070
00:59:31,330 --> 00:59:34,990
<i>the team that's left sitting on
that throne wins the game.</i>

1071
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:38,750
[Even at a quick glance,
it's a battle of strength?]

1072
00:59:39,250 --> 00:59:41,500
- What are you expecting of us?
- Strength!

1073
00:59:41,500 --> 00:59:44,260
<i>Only one person can sit on the chair</i>

1074
00:59:44,270 --> 00:59:47,180
<i>and the other person on the team can fend off
other teams' attempt to steal the seat.</i>

1075
00:59:47,180 --> 00:59:50,440
But to be honest, Jang Hoon is too big
for any of us to fight off.

1076
00:59:51,090 --> 00:59:54,200
<i>If you look behind you,
we've drawn a white boundary line.</i>

1077
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:56,490
<i>You have to start from outside that line.</i>

1078
00:59:56,490 --> 00:59:59,650
- Jang Hoon is way too big!
- Gary and Ji Hyo have the biggest disadvantage.

1079
00:59:59,650 --> 01:00:01,760
- How are we supposed to shove him off?
- This is almost too embarrassing.

1080
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:03,820
[Grumbling about it being too humiliating
if he doesn't win this game...]

1081
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:08,500
And also, Jang Hoon chatters on a lot.
He's nonstop!

1082
01:00:09,110 --> 01:00:11,470
[Adorable chatterer and grumbler.]

1083
01:00:11,470 --> 01:00:13,930
And don't you have anything larger
for him to wear?

1084
01:00:14,050 --> 01:00:16,060
No kidding.

1085
01:00:16,060 --> 01:00:18,750
- You can see his belly.
- What is this supposed to be?

1086
01:00:18,750 --> 01:00:21,140
He's the only one wearing
a belly tee around here.

1087
01:00:21,140 --> 01:00:23,240
You look so sexy!

1088
01:00:23,240 --> 01:00:24,950
[Way too small on Jang Hoon...]

1089
01:00:24,950 --> 01:00:26,500
<i>Order of winning is very
important right now.</i>

1090
01:00:26,500 --> 01:00:29,110
<i>Winning isn't what's important,
but the order you come in is important.</i>

1091
01:00:29,110 --> 01:00:30,900
- Is that right?
- The order we come in?

1092
01:00:30,900 --> 01:00:32,630
[Darn...]

1093
01:00:33,010 --> 01:00:35,600
<i>Okay, you have two minutes
for the first round.</i>

1094
01:00:36,550 --> 01:00:38,290
Set, go!

1095
01:00:43,120 --> 01:00:45,580
[Ricky Kim showing his determined
focus right from the beginning.]

1096
01:00:45,580 --> 01:00:48,020
- There's no reason to sit down now.
- Ji Hyo!

1097
01:00:48,020 --> 01:00:49,550
[Ji Hyo somehow steals the seat
away in the midst of all that chaos.]

1098
01:00:49,550 --> 01:00:52,280
I'll protect you, Ji Hyo!
You just sit tight!

1099
01:00:52,660 --> 01:00:55,880
[Resorting to tickle tactics.]

1100
01:00:58,820 --> 01:01:01,150
You're being too much!

1101
01:01:01,150 --> 01:01:02,500
Get out of the way!

1102
01:01:04,980 --> 01:01:06,500
Hey, stay put in that seat.

1103
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:09,800
[Giraffe with his ability to
withstand all the tickling.]

1104
01:01:14,040 --> 01:01:16,540
[Lifts up his long legs to eliminate him.]

1105
01:01:16,540 --> 01:01:18,990
That's hilarious.
All you have to do is lift up the legs.

1106
01:01:20,670 --> 01:01:23,530
[Ejected from their seat before they
even have the time to get used to the seat.]

1107
01:01:23,530 --> 01:01:26,000
All you need to do is lift up the legs.
Lift up the legs, and they fall over!

1108
01:01:27,140 --> 01:01:29,890
- You can't do that to the seat.
- You have to sit on it.

1109
01:01:29,900 --> 01:01:31,460
- You try it, Jang Hoon.
- Sit and wrap your legs around.

1110
01:01:31,460 --> 01:01:33,980
[Is it finally Jang Hoon, the Goliath's turn?]

1111
01:01:36,130 --> 01:01:37,570
All we have to do is lift up his legs.

1112
01:01:40,270 --> 01:01:43,110
[He's falling over too?]

1113
01:01:44,620 --> 01:01:47,230
[The National Center
easily getting flipped over?]

1114
01:01:48,270 --> 01:01:49,930
- Watch out for his head.
- Are you okay?

1115
01:01:49,940 --> 01:01:51,890
- Yes.
- Are you okay, Jang Hoon?

1116
01:01:51,890 --> 01:01:54,110
- 30 seconds left on the clock!
- We have to flip him over!

1117
01:01:55,220 --> 01:01:58,180
[Cha-perman uses that moment
to steal the seat!]

1118
01:01:58,180 --> 01:02:00,710
[Must withstand the next 30 seconds!]

1119
01:02:02,340 --> 01:02:04,530
[A fierce battlefield!]

1120
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:07,770
[The throne is mine!]

1121
01:02:09,790 --> 01:02:11,630
[Total chaos!]

1122
01:02:14,330 --> 01:02:16,860
[The Tiger somehow sits himself down
in the midst of all that chaos!]

1123
01:02:17,190 --> 01:02:19,990
[Utter chaos]

1124
01:02:36,950 --> 01:02:40,670
[Power of the tiger... come to me!]

1125
01:02:41,450 --> 01:02:44,000
[Only five seconds left on the clock!]

1126
01:02:47,790 --> 01:02:48,870
[Time over!]

1127
01:02:50,870 --> 01:02:53,730
[Jong Kook and Ricky wins!]

1128
01:02:53,730 --> 01:02:55,510
Ricky!
We finally did it!

1129
01:02:55,510 --> 01:02:57,680
- Strength!
- Strength!

1130
01:02:57,680 --> 01:02:58,700
Strength!

1131
01:03:00,750 --> 01:03:02,340
What the heck was that?

1132
01:03:02,340 --> 01:03:04,400
<i>Now we have third, fourth
and fifth place left.</i>

1133
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:06,930
[Easy Brothers came in at second place.]

1134
01:03:07,650 --> 01:03:08,830
Seriously...

1135
01:03:08,830 --> 01:03:10,060
<i>Set...</i>

1136
01:03:10,850 --> 01:03:12,440
Can we take a 30 seconds break?

1137
01:03:13,580 --> 01:03:16,360
- Jang Hoon is...
- Go sit down there for now.

1138
01:03:17,030 --> 01:03:19,630
He's not good at the games,
and he's too big of a softie!

1139
01:03:19,630 --> 01:03:21,660
He says he feels too bad about
using his strength on others.

1140
01:03:26,110 --> 01:03:29,400
[What is this?]

1141
01:03:31,350 --> 01:03:33,680
What are they doing?
What are you two doing?

1142
01:03:38,320 --> 01:03:40,670
We're we too quick to get in this position?
We jumped the gun, didn't we?

1143
01:03:40,670 --> 01:03:42,200
I think we were too premature.

1144
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:44,340
[Too premature with their plan
to withstand the attack.]

1145
01:03:44,340 --> 01:03:47,370
In Pyo, you were too premature.
You were too premature about this.

1146
01:03:47,770 --> 01:03:49,430
Who cares?
I'll just stay.

1147
01:03:50,060 --> 01:03:51,880
<i>You've got 20 seconds left.</i>

1148
01:03:52,490 --> 01:03:54,570
I'll push him forward.
I'll push him off the chair.

1149
01:03:55,010 --> 01:03:57,860
[The throne not looking so secure.]

1150
01:04:00,340 --> 01:04:01,930
[Yoo-hyuk ejected from
his seat within a second.]

1151
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,880
[Just who will come in at third place?]

1152
01:04:09,040 --> 01:04:10,810
- No!
- Get off!

1153
01:04:10,810 --> 01:04:12,170
[Oh? Cha-perman?]

1154
01:04:15,500 --> 01:04:17,390
[Huh?]

1155
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:22,630
[Cha In Pyo steals the seat!]

1156
01:04:25,560 --> 01:04:27,300
It was me!
It's not me?

1157
01:04:28,510 --> 01:04:30,160
In Pyo... In Pyo!

1158
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:33,030
- You need to get off of me.
- Why is Jang Hoon not doing anything?

1159
01:04:33,640 --> 01:04:35,910
Why are you bad at these games?

1160
01:04:35,910 --> 01:04:38,020
<i>Cha In Pyo and You Jae Suk wins!</i>

1161
01:04:38,840 --> 01:04:41,400
- In Pyo, you did it.
- You really won at the last minute.

1162
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:42,990
[Cha-perman's reverse in
the final moment.]

1163
01:04:42,990 --> 01:04:44,830
- You really stole that at the last second.
- It really was at the very last moment.

1164
01:04:46,860 --> 01:04:49,090
- This is the type of man In Pyo is!
- Wow, at the very last moment.

1165
01:04:49,090 --> 01:04:50,370
You really took that at the very last second.

1166
01:04:54,290 --> 01:04:56,770
- Seriously...
- What is he doing with that belly shirt!

1167
01:04:58,370 --> 01:05:00,470
- Hey...
- He's a total goof!

1168
01:05:00,470 --> 01:05:03,020
- He really is a goof.
- But he grumbles nonstop!

1169
01:05:03,030 --> 01:05:04,360
But do you know what he's
going around saying to us?

1170
01:05:04,360 --> 01:05:06,130
He's saying that if he plays seriously,
he's going to hurt everyone.

1171
01:05:06,620 --> 01:05:08,470
What do you mean,
you're going to hurt someone?

1172
01:05:08,470 --> 01:05:09,950
[Feeling humiliated...]

1173
01:05:09,950 --> 01:05:12,670
- Leave me alone.
- Why are you trying to look cool?

1174
01:05:13,210 --> 01:05:15,820
- I'm going to go crazy?
- What's going on with you?

1175
01:05:15,820 --> 01:05:17,740
I don't think those two are
going to be able to lift him off though.

1176
01:05:17,740 --> 01:05:18,930
[This is so embarrassing...]

1177
01:05:18,930 --> 01:05:21,220
- You have to trade your places around.
- 30 seconds on the clock.

1178
01:05:21,220 --> 01:05:23,120
Why even bother trading places
when there are only the four of us?

1179
01:05:24,460 --> 01:05:26,060
- Unbelievable.
- There is goes grumbling again!

1180
01:05:26,060 --> 01:05:28,470
- All he does is grumble!
- It's Eun-two, not Hoon-two.

1181
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:30,210
Quietly-grumbles.
(Play on Korean words)

1182
01:05:30,210 --> 01:05:31,420
Yeah, he's really bad.

1183
01:05:31,430 --> 01:05:32,560
[Extreme dissatisfaction.]

1184
01:05:32,560 --> 01:05:34,830
This is really humiliating.
So can we get this show on the road?

1185
01:05:34,830 --> 01:05:37,410
<i>The time on the clock is 30 seconds.</i>

1186
01:05:37,410 --> 01:05:39,450
- 30 seconds? That's short.
- That's a short time frame.

1187
01:05:39,450 --> 01:05:40,890
Set... go!

1188
01:05:42,980 --> 01:05:46,410
Ji Hyo... don't overexert yourself.

1189
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:48,420
Yeah, grab him and get him
out of the way.

1190
01:05:48,810 --> 01:05:52,460
[Is he telling Ro-Ro to take care of Gary?]

1191
01:05:53,140 --> 01:05:54,380
Wait, Ji Hyo...

1192
01:05:56,970 --> 01:05:58,090
I...

1193
01:06:00,860 --> 01:06:02,340
I'm really sorry about this.

1194
01:06:02,340 --> 01:06:04,610
You know it would be too humiliating
for me to come in at last place.

1195
01:06:05,530 --> 01:06:06,750
What are you doing?

1196
01:06:09,390 --> 01:06:10,750
You have to sit down, Ji Hyo!

1197
01:06:11,630 --> 01:06:13,400
[Blank Ji's on the seat!]

1198
01:06:14,730 --> 01:06:17,750
[Monday Couple wins!]

1199
01:06:17,750 --> 01:06:19,000
Ji Hyo!

1200
01:06:19,580 --> 01:06:21,460
Ji Hyo, you did it!

1201
01:06:27,190 --> 01:06:29,940
What the heck?
Jang Hoon!

1202
01:06:30,590 --> 01:06:32,760
What right do you have to
get ticked off?

1203
01:06:33,660 --> 01:06:36,490
Jang Hoon! What have you
done to get ticked off about?

1204
01:06:36,940 --> 01:06:38,800
Seo Jang Hoon really didn't do anything.

1205
01:06:38,810 --> 01:06:39,860
He just hovered over Ji Hyo...

1206
01:06:39,860 --> 01:06:42,170
[Too mannerly to throw Ji Hyo off the chair,
and the game ends with him hovering.]

1207
01:06:42,170 --> 01:06:44,140
- He's too much of a gentleman.
- He should've taken Gary!

1208
01:06:44,140 --> 01:06:46,270
He's a real man.
That's a real man.

1209
01:06:46,270 --> 01:06:49,770
- Why didn't you get her off the chair?
- How was I supposed to do that?

1210
01:06:51,230 --> 01:06:53,400
You should've done what you
did to Jong Kook!

1211
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:54,810
Gary and Ji Hyo, come here.

1212
01:06:55,400 --> 01:07:00,100
<i>As you all already know,
Jong Kook and Ricky are in first place.</i>

1213
01:07:00,100 --> 01:07:01,790
- First place!
- And second...

1214
01:07:01,790 --> 01:07:05,180
<i>Third, fourth and fifth place consecutively.</i>

1215
01:07:05,180 --> 01:07:07,560
<i>You have to remember this order.</i>

1216
01:07:07,560 --> 01:07:10,470
<i>We will now immediately move over
to our next location.</i>

1217
01:07:10,470 --> 01:07:12,800
- Let's go.
- The final battle isn't far off now.

1218
01:07:13,830 --> 01:07:15,170
In Pyo love...

1219
01:07:15,170 --> 01:07:17,090
- I just joined his fan club today.
- In Pyo is...

1220
01:07:17,100 --> 01:07:19,260
Even though he may be
a bit older now

1221
01:07:19,260 --> 01:07:22,960
he still has youthful vitality,
and is skilled with his words.

1222
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:24,740
He really is a treasure to the variety land.

1223
01:07:24,740 --> 01:07:27,720
- Please continue your love for him.
- Please keep showing your love and support!

1224
01:07:27,720 --> 01:07:30,370
- Inpyolove.net.
- Dot net!

1225
01:07:30,370 --> 01:07:33,430
- I hope you show him lots of love and support.
- Seo Jang Hoon, get out here!

1226
01:07:34,940 --> 01:07:36,570
Seo Jang Hoon, get out here.

1227
01:07:36,570 --> 01:07:38,330
[Calling him out to a duel?]

1228
01:07:38,330 --> 01:07:41,640
We need to determine who's the boss
within our team.

1229
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:43,140
- Seo Jang Hoon, get out here.
- Hey, Jang Hoon!

1230
01:07:43,140 --> 01:07:44,650
Jang Hoon, go and show him
what you've got.

1231
01:07:44,650 --> 01:07:47,330
- This is so humiliating.
- Think of this as your own neighborhood.

1232
01:07:47,330 --> 01:07:48,820
This is too humiliating.

1233
01:07:48,820 --> 01:07:50,700
Jang Hoon, take ten seconds and show him.

1234
01:07:50,700 --> 01:07:53,760
- But if I do this and lose... no way.
- Jang Hoon!

1235
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:55,830
Bring out the beast inside you!

1236
01:07:55,830 --> 01:07:57,190
[A nervous goliath.]

1237
01:07:58,500 --> 01:08:00,770
I have a weird feeling
that I'm going to lose!

1238
01:08:02,230 --> 01:08:05,080
Jang Hoon's really stressed out right now
because of Ha Ha.

1239
01:08:05,080 --> 01:08:06,270
[Been stressed out all day
because of Ro-Ro.]

1240
01:08:06,270 --> 01:08:10,040
Jang Hoon's more stressed about being with
Ha Ha rather than being on the show.

1241
01:08:10,040 --> 01:08:11,480
Ugh, I'm so embarrassed!

1242
01:08:12,340 --> 01:08:14,530
You can't lose here.

1243
01:08:14,530 --> 01:08:17,540
- This round is...
- Do I really have to do this?

1244
01:08:17,540 --> 01:08:19,760
<i>Yes. This is to determine
who the weakest player is.</i>

1245
01:08:19,760 --> 01:08:22,990
[The battle to decide who the
weakest player of the game is.]

1246
01:08:23,410 --> 01:08:25,250
<i>You will have 20 seconds.</i>

1247
01:08:25,250 --> 01:08:26,400
[20 seconds on the clock.]

1248
01:08:26,790 --> 01:08:29,680
I'm going to bet my money on
Ha Dong Hoon!

1249
01:08:29,690 --> 01:08:31,530
I bet everything I have on Dong Hoon!

1250
01:08:31,530 --> 01:08:34,100
- I also bet on Ha Dong Hoon!
- Ha Dong Hoon for me too!

1251
01:08:34,100 --> 01:08:36,240
- Okay, 30 seconds.
- Just do 20 seconds.

1252
01:08:37,820 --> 01:08:40,940
[Even through all the grumbling, he
still does everything that's asked of him.]

1253
01:08:42,040 --> 01:08:44,980
I feel like we're back in elementary school.

1254
01:08:44,980 --> 01:08:49,530
[This feels like a fight between the big and
the little kid back in elementary school.]

1255
01:08:49,530 --> 01:08:51,680
- It does, doesn't it?
- Ten seconds left!

1256
01:08:51,690 --> 01:08:53,400
[Ten seconds left on the clock!]

1257
01:08:54,640 --> 01:08:55,970
Throw him out!

1258
01:08:55,980 --> 01:08:57,940
[They're finally at it!]

1259
01:08:59,210 --> 01:09:01,620
[A real match between the
Heavyweight and the Lightweight]

1260
01:09:05,990 --> 01:09:08,200
[Jang Hoon wins!]

1261
01:09:11,680 --> 01:09:13,110
Why are you using your
strength only on me?

1262
01:09:13,110 --> 01:09:15,440
Why couldn't you do that earlier?
Why!

1263
01:09:15,440 --> 01:09:17,800
Are you happy that you won?
You happy now?

1264
01:09:17,800 --> 01:09:19,850
Look at me!
Let's do it one more time!

1265
01:09:23,820 --> 01:09:25,190
He's stressed out.

1266
01:09:26,630 --> 01:09:28,910
He grabbed your head like
it was a basketball.

1267
01:09:32,970 --> 01:09:34,350
This is so aggravating.

1268
01:09:35,380 --> 01:09:39,190
[What is the next mission that stressed
the importance of the winning order?]

1269
01:09:40,160 --> 01:09:43,160
[At last... the highly anticipated
final mission!]

1270
01:09:43,160 --> 01:09:45,550
- What is this?
- What could it be?

1271
01:09:45,550 --> 01:09:46,560
Is it a dance competition?

1272
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:49,430
- What is all that?
- Ah! Those are the 1,000 pairs of shoes!

1273
01:09:49,440 --> 01:09:53,770
[A thousand pairs of shoes on top
of a specially prepared stage!]

1274
01:09:53,770 --> 01:09:57,180
If we win this, a thousand pairs of shoes will
be donated in the name of Easy Brothers.

1275
01:09:57,180 --> 01:09:59,030
This is really cool.

1276
01:09:59,530 --> 01:10:01,830
Running Man really is very cool.
A thousand pairs of shoes?

1277
01:10:01,830 --> 01:10:04,160
[Touched by seeing the thousand pairs of
shoes that are to be donated.]

1278
01:10:04,160 --> 01:10:06,810
These shoes are going to be donated to
people who have no shoes to wear.

1279
01:10:07,830 --> 01:10:13,900
[More meaningful than any other prize!]

1280
01:10:13,900 --> 01:10:16,670
A pair of shoes can give hope to a person
and get them back on their feet.

1281
01:10:16,670 --> 01:10:20,000
But I really think that I'm
being drawn in by Cha In Pyo's allure.

1282
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:23,500
[Falling in love with In Pyo's generous
and giving heart.]

1283
01:10:23,500 --> 01:10:27,350
[Everyone sign up for
In Pyo's love website!]

1284
01:10:27,350 --> 01:10:29,940
- I signed up today too!
- Everyone should sign up.

1285
01:10:29,940 --> 01:10:32,430
I'm so impressed by In Pyo's personality
that I joined his fan club.

1286
01:10:32,430 --> 01:10:35,250
Our final race for the special
Children's Day episode today is...

1287
01:10:35,250 --> 01:10:36,440
- What is it?
- Is it a top spinner game?

1288
01:10:36,440 --> 01:10:41,530
It's a game that the children voted to be
one of their favorites on Running Man.

1289
01:10:41,530 --> 01:10:42,820
- What could it be?
- Ddak-ji?

1290
01:10:42,820 --> 01:10:47,690
[The final mission, Ddak-ji battle!]

1291
01:10:50,060 --> 01:10:53,890
[To start off the game,
each team receives two Ddak-ji's.]

1292
01:10:53,890 --> 01:10:55,680
Everyone get their Ddak-ji?

1293
01:10:55,680 --> 01:10:59,900
Then those of you who won mission envelopes
will now receive their benefits.

1294
01:10:59,900 --> 01:11:03,290
You will receive an extra certificate which
gives you the chance to exchange your Ddak-ji.

1295
01:11:03,290 --> 01:11:04,810
We have one of those too!

1296
01:11:04,810 --> 01:11:06,970
[Gary, Ji Hyo and In Pyo, Jae Suk each
possess one of those certificates!]

1297
01:11:07,590 --> 01:11:10,180
You also have been given
one of the certificates.

1298
01:11:12,090 --> 01:11:15,640
<i>Okay, the team that came in at fifth place
will compete with the team in fourth place.</i>

1299
01:11:15,640 --> 01:11:17,570
- That's good!
- So you work your way up?

1300
01:11:17,570 --> 01:11:20,660
And the winner of those two
will battle with the third place winners.

1301
01:11:20,660 --> 01:11:22,960
<i>The winner of those two will battle
with the second place</i>

1302
01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:26,140
<i>and finally, the winner from that battle will
have the final match with the first place.</i>

1303
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:28,380
<i>You don't need any more Ddak-ji,
do you, Jong Kook?</i>

1304
01:11:28,380 --> 01:11:30,720
The win is as good as in the bag!

1305
01:11:30,720 --> 01:11:33,330
We don't need any more Ddak-ji!

1306
01:11:33,330 --> 01:11:35,500
- First place has a great advantage.
- They have a huge advantage.

1307
01:11:35,500 --> 01:11:37,680
- They pretty much won this already.
- It's not because we're in the first place.

1308
01:11:37,680 --> 01:11:40,030
But we have the advantage
because of me. Right, Jae Suk?

1309
01:11:40,040 --> 01:11:41,690
It's because of me.

1310
01:11:41,690 --> 01:11:44,210
It's not because we're in the first place,
but because of me.

1311
01:11:44,210 --> 01:11:46,010
- He seriously...
- Ddak-ji King!

1312
01:11:46,010 --> 01:11:47,960
Then let's start this.

1313
01:11:47,960 --> 01:11:53,160
[The old and new king of Ddak-ji...
who will be the ultimate victor?]

1314
01:12:01,770 --> 01:12:07,790
[Fifth place Ha Ha and Jang Hoon vs.
Fourth place Gary and Ji Hyo.]

1315
01:12:07,790 --> 01:12:11,410
[No going easy this time!]

1316
01:12:13,650 --> 01:12:16,160
[Ddak-ji- start!]

1317
01:12:16,160 --> 01:12:17,970
- Chance!
- Fighting!

1318
01:12:18,700 --> 01:12:20,880
This is the best part about playing Ddak-ji.

1319
01:12:22,300 --> 01:12:25,610
Gary wears those runner shoes when
he's about to break out his moves.

1320
01:12:26,370 --> 01:12:28,020
- He's about to bring it.
- His shoes gives him leverage.

1321
01:12:36,590 --> 01:12:39,790
[It flipped over!]

1322
01:12:40,620 --> 01:12:44,950
[Gary eliminates one of Ha Ha and
Jang Hoon's Ddak-ji!]

1323
01:12:45,750 --> 01:12:49,420
[Gary was pretty good with
the Ddak-ji too now that we think about it.]

1324
01:12:49,430 --> 01:12:51,050
Gary's really good at this.

1325
01:12:54,940 --> 01:12:57,520
[Ha Ha and Jang Hoon's chance
to counterattack!]

1326
01:12:57,520 --> 01:12:59,990
- This is your chance!
- Get closer, Jang Hoon.

1327
01:12:59,990 --> 01:13:01,230
- Okay.
- Don't move from that position.

1328
01:13:01,230 --> 01:13:03,420
You can hit it, right?
You just need to hit it.

1329
01:13:04,270 --> 01:13:06,810
- Hit it from the top.
- You just need to hit the Ddak-ji.

1330
01:13:07,150 --> 01:13:09,800
If I don't hit this,
then I'll be humiliated again.

1331
01:13:10,270 --> 01:13:12,040
- Hit it from the top.
- Just hit it really hard.

1332
01:13:12,040 --> 01:13:13,820
- There you go.
- Your form doesn't look right.

1333
01:13:17,460 --> 01:13:20,200
You have to hit it directly above it.

1334
01:13:20,200 --> 01:13:23,740
[Very different than when he
used to play basketball...]

1335
01:13:29,840 --> 01:13:32,040
Is it over?
Is first round over?

1336
01:13:32,040 --> 01:13:33,590
[Ha Ha and Jang Hoon - Disqualified.]

1337
01:13:33,590 --> 01:13:36,530
[Gary and Ji Hyo move up to
the next round.]

1338
01:13:36,530 --> 01:13:39,260
- Why is he so good?
- Is it over for us?

1339
01:13:40,110 --> 01:13:44,490
[It's over...]

1340
01:13:55,420 --> 01:13:58,190
[Jae Suk and In Pyo vs. Gary and Ji Hyo.]

1341
01:13:59,200 --> 01:14:01,260
[The battle between the original Ddak-ji king
and the Ddak-ji genius.]

1342
01:14:01,260 --> 01:14:02,620
If we don't get it the first time,
Gary will definitely flip it over.

1343
01:14:02,620 --> 01:14:04,240
He's that good?

1344
01:14:04,240 --> 01:14:07,150
- Let's not think too much about it.
- Don't think too much about it.

1345
01:14:07,150 --> 01:14:08,520
There's no reason to even
think about it.

1346
01:14:08,520 --> 01:14:10,550
- Let's do this.
- I'm not thinking about anything at all.

1347
01:14:12,930 --> 01:14:15,170
- Let's not think about anything.
- Please.... just one chance!

1348
01:14:15,170 --> 01:14:16,670
- Just give us one chance.
- No thoughts!

1349
01:14:20,150 --> 01:14:22,070
If you play this too much,
you start to lose your strength.

1350
01:14:30,340 --> 01:14:33,740
[Jae Suk easily eliminates one.]

1351
01:14:33,750 --> 01:14:35,290
The Ddak-ji king has returned!

1352
01:14:35,290 --> 01:14:37,500
Yes!

1353
01:14:38,780 --> 01:14:41,600
[Ddak-ji king showing us what class
is all about from the beginning.]

1354
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:42,820
Let's do this again.

1355
01:14:44,740 --> 01:14:46,590
- Nice!
- That's good, Ji Hyo!

1356
01:14:46,590 --> 01:14:47,980
- Nice!
- Nice job.

1357
01:14:47,980 --> 01:14:50,510
- That's good.
- That makes it harder to flip over.

1358
01:14:51,200 --> 01:14:53,550
[Not even budging.]

1359
01:14:53,550 --> 01:14:55,360
- She stomped that to the ground.
- That didn't even move.

1360
01:14:55,360 --> 01:14:57,120
- That's right.
- That's how you do it!

1361
01:14:57,120 --> 01:14:58,900
- Good!
- You're better than Jang Hoon.

1362
01:15:00,930 --> 01:15:02,700
- Yeah.
- I had a feeling I'd lose.

1363
01:15:03,300 --> 01:15:04,870
Please... just one more chance!

1364
01:15:04,870 --> 01:15:06,140
Oh my!

1365
01:15:06,140 --> 01:15:08,680
[Missed hit]

1366
01:15:09,200 --> 01:15:12,090
- What luck is this!
- What was that?

1367
01:15:12,130 --> 01:15:14,330
- What luck is this!
- I can't believe I did that!

1368
01:15:14,330 --> 01:15:16,970
- How could that have happened?
- You're acting really happy about this.

1369
01:15:16,980 --> 01:15:19,760
- In Pyo...
- All that nervousness sapped me of energy.

1370
01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:22,390
- You have to hit it right in the middle.
- Don't be too nervous about it.

1371
01:15:22,390 --> 01:15:23,490
[Ddak-ji king's turn to counterattack!]

1372
01:15:33,670 --> 01:15:37,360
[He flips it over!]

1373
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:43,860
[If he flips over one more of Gary
and Ji Hyo's Ddak-ji, the round is over!]

1374
01:15:45,250 --> 01:15:49,510
You have to take this very seriously.
Gary's team is a very strong team.

1375
01:15:51,110 --> 01:15:54,400
- If we don't get it here, we're in trouble.
- I'm sorry, but who's the champion?

1376
01:15:58,370 --> 01:16:01,100
- We have to make it entertaining, right?
- Okay, I got it.

1377
01:16:01,100 --> 01:16:02,650
We have to keep it entertaining.

1378
01:16:05,230 --> 01:16:07,650
- There's your chance, Gary!
- You can do this, Gary!

1379
01:16:08,580 --> 01:16:11,810
This old man keeps walking around watching
with his hands in his pockets.

1380
01:16:14,370 --> 01:16:16,050
Where's your home?

1381
01:16:16,980 --> 01:16:18,490
Are you from around this neighborhood?

1382
01:16:18,490 --> 01:16:19,930
- Ask him if he's hungry.
- Isn't this fun?

1383
01:16:19,930 --> 01:16:21,480
You're so tall!

1384
01:16:23,500 --> 01:16:27,670
- You're a sight around here.
- You're really annoying Jang Hoon.

1385
01:16:27,930 --> 01:16:30,170
Would you like some noodles?

1386
01:16:31,720 --> 01:16:35,200
Listen... Gary has to concentrate right now.

1387
01:16:35,200 --> 01:16:39,430
[Ddak-ji genius Gary...
will he able to overcome this obstacle?]

1388
01:16:39,430 --> 01:16:40,440
I can do this.

1389
01:16:43,890 --> 01:16:46,090
- I hit it on the mark too.
- That was a good hit.

1390
01:16:46,090 --> 01:16:48,710
If I don't flip this over,
we'll be in danger.

1391
01:16:53,880 --> 01:16:57,380
[Jae Suk eliminates all three of
Gary and Ji Hyo's Ddak-ji!]

1392
01:16:58,440 --> 01:16:59,490
Very cool.

1393
01:16:59,490 --> 01:17:02,070
[Oh.. not bad...]

1394
01:17:02,590 --> 01:17:04,850
- That was very cool.
- I wish you the best of luck.

1395
01:17:04,850 --> 01:17:06,890
Thank you.
I will win this for both of us.

1396
01:17:06,890 --> 01:17:09,260
Go out there and flatten Jong Kook, okay?

1397
01:17:09,260 --> 01:17:11,710
I will make it to the finals no matter what.
Next team, come on up!

1398
01:17:22,530 --> 01:17:26,610
[Suk Jin and Kwang Soo vs.
Jae Suk and In Pyo.]

1399
01:17:27,550 --> 01:17:29,150
What are we going to do?

1400
01:17:32,330 --> 01:17:37,060
[Even though he's down with a bad cold...]

1401
01:17:40,430 --> 01:17:44,710
[But since he's on the show today,
he's going to show off his tough side!]

1402
01:17:44,710 --> 01:17:46,450
Stay back.
You may get hurt if you're too close.

1403
01:17:46,580 --> 01:17:49,660
I would've taken off my jacket if I was told
that it was okay to do that earlier.

1404
01:17:57,100 --> 01:18:00,000
- What kind of a slamming method is that?
- It's In Pyo's special move!

1405
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:05,820
[The legendary master moves!]

1406
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:09,210
[Definitely psyching himself up.]

1407
01:18:14,030 --> 01:18:15,880
I'm really going to sign up
as a member of his fan club.

1408
01:18:15,880 --> 01:18:19,190
[Focusing and gathering up all his senses.]

1409
01:18:19,190 --> 01:18:21,070
We're accepting new members to
Inpyolove.net!

1410
01:18:21,410 --> 01:18:23,100
- Please.
- Everyone keep it down.

1411
01:18:23,100 --> 01:18:24,790
Give me at least one chance!

1412
01:18:25,560 --> 01:18:27,530
Look at the laser beams
shooting out of his eyes.

1413
01:18:27,530 --> 01:18:29,220
What if he misses?

1414
01:18:31,410 --> 01:18:33,090
- Don't pay attention.
- I'm sorry.

1415
01:18:35,950 --> 01:18:38,210
[In that one blow of Ddak-ji...]

1416
01:18:38,210 --> 01:18:41,960
[All his energy is being focused.]

1417
01:18:49,710 --> 01:18:52,930
[Total miss.]

1418
01:18:55,020 --> 01:18:59,140
[Oh no...]

1419
01:18:59,140 --> 01:19:00,650
What was that?

1420
01:19:00,650 --> 01:19:02,510
Where are you throwing that thing?

1421
01:19:03,530 --> 01:19:05,540
I can't see very well with my sight.

1422
01:19:05,850 --> 01:19:07,270
Someone get him a pair of glasses.

1423
01:19:07,270 --> 01:19:11,620
[Is he blaming his miss on his old age?]

1424
01:19:11,620 --> 01:19:12,770
He's serious about having bad vision.

1425
01:19:12,770 --> 01:19:14,770
- Ugh, I'm cold.
- I'm going to lose my mind.

1426
01:19:14,780 --> 01:19:19,350
[After taking off his jacket with fanfare,
now he's cold all of a sudden...]

1427
01:19:19,350 --> 01:19:21,540
- He says he's cold now.
- You should've just hit it normally.

1428
01:19:21,540 --> 01:19:23,650
[Suk Jin and Kwang Soo's turn
to counterattack.]

1429
01:19:24,920 --> 01:19:26,570
- There we go. In Pyo!
- He didn't flip it over?

1430
01:19:26,570 --> 01:19:28,210
- He didn't flip it over?
- No, he didn't flip it.

1431
01:19:28,210 --> 01:19:30,090
[Takes it off again.]

1432
01:19:31,450 --> 01:19:32,960
Which one?
Which one is mine?

1433
01:19:32,960 --> 01:19:34,290
The blue one.
That one right there.

1434
01:19:34,500 --> 01:19:38,650
[After his show of his legendary moves,
he's slightly confused.]

1435
01:19:38,650 --> 01:19:40,730
Show us your legendary moves one more time.

1436
01:19:40,730 --> 01:19:42,860
You mean moving my arms,
back and shoulder muscles around?

1437
01:19:42,890 --> 01:19:44,320
I don't think he's going to hit it.

1438
01:19:46,750 --> 01:19:49,030
Back muscles, shoulders and your sides...
you have to move it altogether.

1439
01:19:49,030 --> 01:19:51,930
- Back, shoulders and the sides together.
- I have another move.

1440
01:19:54,930 --> 01:19:58,450
Flesh, flesh, my round flesh.
Make my flesh as tight as a board.

1441
01:19:58,450 --> 01:20:00,130
Where did my flesh go!

1442
01:20:01,060 --> 01:20:03,690
[Raising the bar for side exercises
to a whole new level.]

1443
01:20:03,690 --> 01:20:04,850
This is your side exercise.

1444
01:20:04,880 --> 01:20:08,140
Flesh, flesh, my round flesh.
Make my flesh as tight as a board.

1445
01:20:14,070 --> 01:20:15,350
- I can't get my balance.
- Are you okay?

1446
01:20:15,350 --> 01:20:17,250
Hurry up and do this!

1447
01:20:17,250 --> 01:20:19,330
[That exercise isn't used
in a time like this.]

1448
01:20:19,330 --> 01:20:20,920
This is what you do instead.

1449
01:20:21,530 --> 01:20:23,090
What's that now?

1450
01:20:23,700 --> 01:20:25,560
This is working your S-line.

1451
01:20:25,560 --> 01:20:27,420
Let's all take a walk... thank you.

1452
01:20:27,420 --> 01:20:28,820
What is his deal?

1453
01:20:30,510 --> 01:20:31,680
He's driving me crazy.

1454
01:20:37,060 --> 01:20:40,310
[Stops in the middle of a flip!]

1455
01:20:40,900 --> 01:20:43,180
- That should've flipped over!
- You almost had it!

1456
01:20:43,790 --> 01:20:46,730
[In Pyo finally having figured it out.]

1457
01:20:46,730 --> 01:20:48,470
- You get it now, right?
- I get it now.

1458
01:20:55,950 --> 01:20:59,150
[He flips it over!]

1459
01:20:59,150 --> 01:21:01,050
- That was good, Kwang Soo.
- I did my best though.

1460
01:21:01,050 --> 01:21:04,560
[Jae Suk and In Pyo still have
two Ddak-ji's left over!]

1461
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:06,850
- You still have on left?
- No, we have two left.

1462
01:21:08,230 --> 01:21:10,510
- Wow, Kwang Soo...
- This is our chance.

1463
01:21:10,510 --> 01:21:12,110
Let's do this, Kwang Soo!

1464
01:21:12,110 --> 01:21:14,410
[Giraffe's confidence is way up!]

1465
01:21:16,190 --> 01:21:19,360
[I will end this!]

1466
01:21:22,440 --> 01:21:24,590
[Is he already depleted of his energy?]

1467
01:21:25,620 --> 01:21:28,550
- You're already out of energy?
- You have to recharge yourself.

1468
01:21:29,860 --> 01:21:31,220
[Ddak-ji king's counterattack.]

1469
01:21:31,220 --> 01:21:32,770
Why is everyone taking off their clothes?

1470
01:21:35,900 --> 01:21:39,540
[It flipped over!]

1471
01:21:44,490 --> 01:21:48,450
[If he flips one more over,
Jae Suk and In Pyo are in the finals!]

1472
01:21:52,210 --> 01:21:53,560
It only hit the side.

1473
01:21:53,560 --> 01:21:55,980
I wasn't going to take off my clothes
since I don't like doing that.

1474
01:21:55,990 --> 01:21:58,090
But why is it that you don't look threatening
at all when you take your clothes off?

1475
01:21:58,090 --> 01:22:00,130
If anything, you look really cute.

1476
01:22:00,130 --> 01:22:03,100
- You look like a honeybee.
- Ji Suk Jin, the honeybee!

1477
01:22:03,100 --> 01:22:05,810
[Ji Suk Jin's special honeybee outfit
in honor of Children's day!]

1478
01:22:05,820 --> 01:22:08,970
- The honey is mine!
- It's honey!

1479
01:22:12,500 --> 01:22:14,670
Why didn't my stylist bring me
something more fierce looking?

1480
01:22:14,670 --> 01:22:17,400
You know those shirts with
bolts of lightning painted on them?

1481
01:22:17,400 --> 01:22:19,830
- What the heck is this?
- It's honeybee shirt!

1482
01:22:21,040 --> 01:22:22,750
It should've been a shirt with
skulls or something on it.

1483
01:22:23,610 --> 01:22:24,670
Just hurry up.

1484
01:22:31,950 --> 01:22:35,530
[Jae Suk and In Pyo move on
to the finals!]

1485
01:22:36,370 --> 01:22:39,430
[Rather than calling it the finals...]

1486
01:22:39,440 --> 01:22:46,390
[It's time to determine who the
true Ddak-ji king will be...]

1487
01:22:48,750 --> 01:22:55,710
[Legend of Ddak-ji, Yoo-hyuk that
everyone first saw...]

1488
01:22:57,480 --> 01:23:01,810
[The one day...]

1489
01:23:01,810 --> 01:23:08,170
[That legend... came to an end.]

1490
01:23:10,330 --> 01:23:16,080
[Even though he lost his throne...]

1491
01:23:21,040 --> 01:23:25,500
[The battle was lost due to a mistake.]

1492
01:23:27,030 --> 01:23:32,450
[The Ddak-ji King... is Kim Jong Kook.]

1493
01:23:33,900 --> 01:23:37,600
[But today...]

1494
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:40,610
- You want to win really badly, don't you?
- You're so spiteful!

1495
01:23:40,610 --> 01:23:42,650
- You really want to win, don't you?
- You really are so spiteful.

1496
01:23:42,650 --> 01:23:44,900
Since you haven't won at all lately.

1497
01:23:44,900 --> 01:23:47,410
[You dare to steal my throne?]

1498
01:23:50,440 --> 01:23:54,850
[Today, someone will be crowned king...]

1499
01:23:55,530 --> 01:23:59,650
[And the other will fall from grace.]

1500
01:24:13,180 --> 01:24:16,160
[Jae Suk and In Pyo vs. Jong Kook and Ricky.]

1501
01:24:19,890 --> 01:24:22,510
[Flattening it as much as possible.]

1502
01:24:22,510 --> 01:24:24,990
-  Ddak-ji of rage.
- Have you seen  Ddak-ji of rage before?

1503
01:24:24,990 --> 01:24:27,300
[In Pyo is definitely the ultimate
teammate one could ask for!]

1504
01:24:27,300 --> 01:24:28,720
He's just doing pushups.

1505
01:24:28,720 --> 01:24:30,930
- He's much worse than me!
- He's just doing pushups!

1506
01:24:32,360 --> 01:24:35,120
He's just doing pushups.
Pushups of rage.

1507
01:24:35,120 --> 01:24:36,440
Here I go.

1508
01:24:36,440 --> 01:24:38,140
- Here I go.
- Go ahead.

1509
01:24:43,890 --> 01:24:46,200
- Why didn't it flip over?
- This isn't going to be an easy battle.

1510
01:24:46,730 --> 01:24:49,050
You have to loosen up a bit first.

1511
01:24:49,050 --> 01:24:50,730
Remember from earlier.
It's all about your balance.

1512
01:24:51,460 --> 01:24:53,190
Like this, In Pyo.
You need to hold it like this.

1513
01:24:53,190 --> 01:24:54,610
There you go.

1514
01:24:55,160 --> 01:24:56,890
No!
Loosen up your thumb.

1515
01:24:58,310 --> 01:25:00,130
You have to give it a burst of power
at the very last moment.

1516
01:25:00,130 --> 01:25:02,530
Everyone... thank you, seriously.

1517
01:25:02,530 --> 01:25:06,900
- You know that I'm thankful, right?
- Put all your passion into this!

1518
01:25:06,900 --> 01:25:09,170
Put all the passion in your life
into this hit!

1519
01:25:09,170 --> 01:25:10,720
There you go!

1520
01:25:10,720 --> 01:25:12,350
[Too bad!]

1521
01:25:12,350 --> 01:25:15,580
Why is everyone getting so worked up?
I didn't think it was going to flip.

1522
01:25:15,580 --> 01:25:17,460
Why are you talking so much?

1523
01:25:17,460 --> 01:25:19,310
He really does talk a lot.

1524
01:25:25,960 --> 01:25:28,960
[The current Ddak-ji king's
higher level of attack.]

1525
01:25:30,380 --> 01:25:33,890
[At last...]

1526
01:25:33,890 --> 01:25:42,530
[Who will become the ultimate Ddak-ji king?]

1527
01:25:42,800 --> 01:25:50,060
[Remaining Ddak-ji count-
Jae Suk and In Pyo- 1; Kkuk and Ricky- 2.]

1528
01:25:53,890 --> 01:25:57,470
[Jae Suk's last remaining Ddak-ji
holds out!]

1529
01:25:58,960 --> 01:26:04,560
[The most nerve-wrecking moment of Ddak-ji
in the history of all Running Man Ddak-ji games.]

1530
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:06,640
- Let's spin the camera. Let's go.
- This is your chance, Jae Suk.

1531
01:26:07,560 --> 01:26:13,970
[Will the Ddak-ji king's throne
be returned to the original king?]

1532
01:26:16,430 --> 01:26:18,040
There's too much of a gap
under that thing.

1533
01:26:18,050 --> 01:26:21,130
I'm the original Ddak-ji king.
I have to beat Kim Jong Kook.

1534
01:26:21,130 --> 01:26:24,600
Seriously...
I will reclaim my title as Ddak-ji king!

1535
01:26:24,600 --> 01:26:27,130
No, no, no...

1536
01:26:27,130 --> 01:26:28,190
No!

1537
01:26:29,850 --> 01:26:32,460
- This is your chance. It's okay.
- Oh my God!

1538
01:26:32,460 --> 01:26:34,040
[Every chance is a moment of danger!]

1539
01:26:34,040 --> 01:26:35,410
We've got our chance!

1540
01:26:38,750 --> 01:26:41,930
- If he flips this over, I'm finished.
- It's okay. He won't do it.

1541
01:26:43,770 --> 01:26:44,910
Here I go.

1542
01:26:45,390 --> 01:26:46,840
Please don't flip over.

1543
01:26:51,660 --> 01:26:53,630
- I thought you had it.
- Ah, I thought I had it.

1544
01:26:53,640 --> 01:26:56,080
- Look at how nervous everyone is.
- I thought that was it.

1545
01:26:57,770 --> 01:26:59,680
- You can do this!
- I have to get it this time.

1546
01:27:02,760 --> 01:27:04,650
[Throwing his whole body into
the attack!]

1547
01:27:04,900 --> 01:27:07,020
Why is everyone letting Ddak-ji
do this to them?

1548
01:27:07,020 --> 01:27:09,420
[Who knew that one Ddak-ji could
become so cutthroat?]

1549
01:27:09,430 --> 01:27:11,020
You can do it!

1550
01:27:13,820 --> 01:27:17,410
[Each throw drains them of their energy...]

1551
01:27:20,370 --> 01:27:21,640
You can do this.

1552
01:27:30,740 --> 01:27:34,320
[It didn't flip over!]

1553
01:27:34,320 --> 01:27:35,460
We're almost there.

1554
01:27:35,460 --> 01:27:38,270
[Even those watching from the sidelines...]

1555
01:27:38,270 --> 01:27:40,480
[And those in the match...]

1556
01:27:40,490 --> 01:27:44,220
[It's sucking all the energy
out of them.]

1557
01:27:44,700 --> 01:27:46,580
Why is this so nerve-wrecking?

1558
01:27:46,590 --> 01:27:50,160
[Ddak-ji king's final match that's bringing
everyone to the edge of their seats.]

1559
01:27:52,280 --> 01:27:55,310
[More and more...]

1560
01:27:55,310 --> 01:27:57,980
[These two are throwing everything
they have left into their throws!]

1561
01:27:57,980 --> 01:28:01,150
I'm a fan of both of you!

1562
01:28:02,550 --> 01:28:04,160
[Stirring up the crowd!]

1563
01:28:04,160 --> 01:28:07,390
[A fair crowd encouraging on both the
old and the new king!]

1564
01:28:09,770 --> 01:28:11,980
[Too bad!]

1565
01:28:13,900 --> 01:28:15,680
This is the 'Fist of Fury'
that legends speak of!

1566
01:28:16,050 --> 01:28:18,680
- The two-horse carriage!
- Misery loves company!

1567
01:28:20,120 --> 01:28:23,940
[Hit it]

1568
01:28:23,940 --> 01:28:25,610
[Beat it]

1569
01:28:25,610 --> 01:28:28,370
[Throw it]

1570
01:28:28,370 --> 01:28:29,550
[And throw it again]

1571
01:28:29,550 --> 01:28:34,710
[A long drawn out battle befitting
a battle between the two kings!]

1572
01:28:34,710 --> 01:28:37,240
- This isn't coming to an end.
- That sounded good though.

1573
01:28:38,210 --> 01:28:39,820
Massage... massage his arms.

1574
01:28:40,360 --> 01:28:42,330
I should've done better.
I'm sorry.

1575
01:28:43,370 --> 01:28:46,840
If I come on the show again,
I'll make sure to be better prepared.

1576
01:28:48,260 --> 01:28:51,050
[Even giving words of encouragement...]

1577
01:28:51,050 --> 01:28:53,210
I'll come back once I get my
implant back in.

1578
01:28:54,730 --> 01:28:57,080
[Ten minutes passes on by...]

1579
01:28:57,570 --> 01:29:00,080
[20 minutes passes on by...]

1580
01:29:00,670 --> 01:29:03,300
[30 minutes passes on by...]

1581
01:29:04,300 --> 01:29:08,790
[But the Ddak-ji between the two kings
refuse to flip over.]

1582
01:29:10,930 --> 01:29:12,860
- Would you like a massage too?
- No, it's okay.

1583
01:29:15,040 --> 01:29:16,990
I don't know what's going on here.

1584
01:29:20,300 --> 01:29:21,890
Please stop!

1585
01:29:22,290 --> 01:29:25,200
- Please stop this battle!
- This man is going to collapse!

1586
01:29:25,200 --> 01:29:27,450
I'm hitting the slate!

1587
01:29:31,140 --> 01:29:32,960
Why is this such a big deal?

1588
01:29:32,960 --> 01:29:34,860
Stop tormenting my brothers!

1589
01:29:41,460 --> 01:29:44,560
- Can we do something about the Ddak-ji?
- If both of you agree to it...

1590
01:29:44,570 --> 01:29:46,940
It's possible that the Ddak-ji isn't flipping
over because it's been hit so much.

1591
01:29:46,940 --> 01:29:51,430
- Would you like to trade them out for new?
- I think that would be best.

1592
01:29:52,720 --> 01:29:55,820
Ricky and In Pyo can come forward and
choose one each for your team.

1593
01:29:55,820 --> 01:29:58,310
[Each team trades up for a new Ddak-ji.]

1594
01:29:58,310 --> 01:30:00,410
They're trading in for a new Ddak-ji!

1595
01:30:00,410 --> 01:30:02,020
It's time one of them flips over.

1596
01:30:02,420 --> 01:30:06,140
[Who will be the ultimate winner left
standing after this drawn out battle?]

1597
01:30:06,140 --> 01:30:07,950
I have a better feeling about this.

1598
01:30:07,950 --> 01:30:09,820
- With the new Ddak-ji.
- Right?

1599
01:30:09,820 --> 01:30:11,120
Okay, here I go.

1600
01:30:13,640 --> 01:30:15,090
This may be the end.

1601
01:30:16,110 --> 01:30:18,220
You look exhausted now, Jae Suk.

1602
01:30:18,220 --> 01:30:20,980
I thought it flipped over because
I only caught a glimpse of the hit.

1603
01:30:51,800 --> 01:30:54,710
[It flipped over!]

1604
01:30:56,570 --> 01:31:01,380
[Yoo-hyuk beats Jong Kook,
the current Ddak-ji king!]

1605
01:31:01,380 --> 01:31:08,650
[After an hour of a long,
drawn out battle!]

1606
01:31:08,650 --> 01:31:10,200
Congratulations, Jae Suk!

1607
01:31:11,410 --> 01:31:15,450
[Even though Ricky still has
his Ddak-ji left...]

1608
01:31:17,280 --> 01:31:18,820
- You're just about to begin your fight.
- Hey.

1609
01:31:19,820 --> 01:31:21,570
Get out of here!

1610
01:31:23,260 --> 01:31:28,810
[If he succeeds in flipping over Ricky's
Ddak-ji, he will return to being the king!]

1611
01:31:47,250 --> 01:31:55,410
[The Ddak-ji king is... Yoo Jae Suk!]

1612
01:31:57,530 --> 01:32:01,960
[The return of the Ddak-ji king!]

1613
01:32:04,820 --> 01:32:08,030
[Even though he lost,
this champion also gave it his best.]

1614
01:32:09,410 --> 01:32:12,540
[Looking more happy than he would at
an end of the year award ceremony.]

1615
01:32:14,870 --> 01:32:19,610
<i>Yoo Jae Suk!
Yoo Jae Suk!</i>

1616
01:32:19,610 --> 01:32:24,000
[Now that the competition is over,
takes the time out to thank the opponent.]

1617
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:25,230
Ricky!

1618
01:32:26,190 --> 01:32:28,450
Next round is
Seo Jang Hoon vs. Song Ji Hyo!

1619
01:32:29,480 --> 01:32:31,900
Is it over now?
That was unbelievable.

1620
01:32:32,270 --> 01:32:35,650
[The bloodiest battle Running Man
has ever seen in its history!]

1621
01:32:36,750 --> 01:32:41,260
<i>On this Children's Day, in the name
of Cha In Pyo and Yoo Jae Suk</i>

1622
01:32:41,260 --> 01:32:44,390
<i>one thousand pairs of shoes will be
donated to those in need.</i>

1623
01:32:44,390 --> 01:32:49,180
[In the name of Cha In Pyo and Yoo Jae Suk,
one thousand pairs of shoes were donated.]

1624
01:32:49,180 --> 01:32:50,520
This makes me so happy.

1625
01:32:50,520 --> 01:32:52,090
This truly makes me so happy.

1626
01:32:52,090 --> 01:32:54,990
I will take this Ddak-ji game to America
and spread the game out there.

1627
01:32:54,990 --> 01:32:57,950
- Yes, you should try that.
- Why didn't we think of that?

1628
01:32:57,950 --> 01:33:00,180
- It was so much fun.
- I think people would really enjoy it.

1629
01:33:00,180 --> 01:33:02,060
How was today for you, In Pyo?

1630
01:33:02,060 --> 01:33:05,630
Being on the show with all of you today
brought me such joy and happiness.

1631
01:33:05,630 --> 01:33:07,650
With today being Children's Day on May 5th

1632
01:33:07,650 --> 01:33:10,340
I hope that the children receive
their new shoes

1633
01:33:10,340 --> 01:33:16,440
and it helps them grow their hopes and dreams
and that they'll go after them wholeheartedly.

1634
01:33:16,440 --> 01:33:18,720
In Pyo has such a generous heart.

1635
01:33:18,720 --> 01:33:21,840
- To be with such amazing people...
- You'll come back again, won't you?

1636
01:33:23,490 --> 01:33:26,640
- You should come back again soon!
- Please come back!

1637
01:33:26,640 --> 01:33:29,100
Since you've got some time right now
with your less hectic schedule...

1638
01:33:29,100 --> 01:33:30,930
- Please come back again.
- You should definitely come back.

1639
01:33:31,470 --> 01:33:33,280
In that case...

1640
01:33:35,600 --> 01:33:38,250
- We'll definitely have him back.
- Thank you for being on the show today.

1641
01:33:38,250 --> 01:33:39,600
Thank you!

1642
01:33:46,100 --> 01:33:47,770
Jang Hoon, are you two
playing each other?

1643
01:33:48,710 --> 01:33:51,000
- I don't know about that guy.
- Who's winning?

1644
01:33:54,900 --> 01:33:56,610
Are you trying to determine who the
weakest Ddak-ji player is?
