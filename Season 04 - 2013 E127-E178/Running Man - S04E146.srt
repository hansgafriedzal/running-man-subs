Do you guys even have any
evidence or what?

392

- Seriously.
- You can't do it like this.

393

In this world where everyone
is innocent until proven guilty

[Overly cocky from knowing the
detectives have no proof.]

not even here.

speak without fumbling their words.]

- Why can't you talk clearly?
- Treating us like this is...

401
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:57,520
Why are you treating like this
without any cause?

[Scaring another criminal member, Haroro who
is in the midst of completing his mission.]

I used to be!

- Wait...
- What do you think you're doing right now?

413

- Do I need to get a warrant for you?
- I'm not that kind of a person.

414

I've always been a good beans and rice
eater and my mom loved me for that.

for every 100 beans!

00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:03,290
<i>The criminals have stolen a boat and
are heading towards Eupcheon Harbor.</i>

669
00:35:03,290 --> 00:35:07,090
[The criminals have taken over a boat,
and are heading towards Eupcheon Harbor.]

670
00:35:08,210 --> 00:35:09,890
- Boat?
- They took a dog?

671
00:35:09,890 --> 00:35:12,330
- Not 'gae' (dog), but 'bae' (boat).
- Oh, I thought you said, dog.

672
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:15,410
Detective Team Two thinks
they took a dog right now.

673
00:35:15,410 --> 00:35:18,650
- Not a dog, but a boat.
- Oh, I see.

674
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:21,800
- They took what?
- They took a boat.

675
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,730
- What? A dog?
- No, a boat.

676
00:35:24,730 --> 00:35:26,840
[I guess Detective Team Two
needs new walkie-talkies.]

677
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:31,110
How are we going to
come up with three questions?

678
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:34,180
[Arrives at Eupcheon Harbor
past the Mural Village.]

679
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:37,660
- Hey! Over there!
- Hey! Lee Kwang Soo!

680
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:42,870
- Come and get us if you can!
- We've got a hostage!

681
00:35:44,090 --> 00:35:46,140
So what?

682
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:47,790
Hurry up and come over here!

683
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:49,890
Our hostage...

684
00:35:50,310 --> 00:35:52,300
knows where a composite is hidden!

685
00:35:53,650 --> 00:35:54,910
[Huh?]

686
00:35:55,210 --> 00:35:56,320
[Top grade information... Is that so?]

687
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,140
Where is the composite?

688
00:35:59,430 --> 00:36:01,470
Why would you tell them that?

689
00:36:01,850 --> 00:36:05,190
- Seriously... how could you tell them that?
- Where is the composite? Tell us.

690
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:07,490
He told them that we know
where the composite is.

691
00:36:07,570 --> 00:36:09,640
You have been surrounded.

692
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:11,920
You have been surrounded.

693
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:14,540
- Don't make us laugh!
- You have been surrounded!

694
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:17,160
You're dead once I get
my hands on you.

695
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:18,740
You better run far away!

696
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:22,530
- There are a lot of angry people here.
- Kim Sang Kyung...

697
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:24,840
Kim Sang Kyung, step forward.

698
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,700
Hey, Kim Sang Kyung!

699
00:36:27,210 --> 00:36:30,110
- Have you even been feeding yourself?
- Of course, I have been feeding myself.

700
00:36:30,110 --> 00:36:33,250
- Don't get sucked into their ploy.
- I'm not getting sucked into your ploy!

701
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:37,580
I should've said I haven't eaten anything.
I should've said that I was starving.

702
00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:41,410
- Look, you guys have to answer our questions.
- Questions?

703
00:36:41,410 --> 00:36:43,280
- What questions?
- Why?

704
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:46,000
We will hand over our hostage
over to the winning team.

705
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,400
This is a quiz game.

706
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,870
Ask for a jjajangmyun.
I want some jjajangmyun.

707
00:36:48,870 --> 00:36:51,890
We'll give you your question
if you bring us a jjajangmyun!

708
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:54,250
[Jjajangmyun?]

709
00:36:54,530 --> 00:36:56,650
First, bring us a jjajangmyun.

710
00:36:56,650 --> 00:36:58,230
Have it delivered to us.

711
00:36:58,230 --> 00:37:02,330
- How are we supposed to deliver it to them?
- I want fried rice.

712
00:37:02,530 --> 00:37:04,950
Here is a phone number right here.

713
00:37:04,950 --> 00:37:07,740
[Just then, they discover a phone number to
a Chinese restaurant on the seawall.]

714
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:09,270
[Moments later.]

715
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:15,450
Who ordered the jjajangmyun?

716
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,950
Who ordered the jjajangmyun!

717
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:22,090
- Hey, jjajangmyun is coming.
- Over here! Jjajangmyun is over here!

718
00:37:22,090 --> 00:37:23,520
- Over here!
- Here!

719
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,860
[Hardcore delivery mentality.]

720
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:28,420
Wow, I can't believe he delivered.
Thank you for your hard work, Sir.

721
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:31,750
How is it even possible he delivered
all the way over there on a boat?

722
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:34,770
- Thank you so much.
- He delivered that on a boat?

723
00:37:34,770 --> 00:37:37,520
- He's not coming here?
- There will be a separate delivery.

724
00:37:37,530 --> 00:37:39,070
- Were you about to get angry?
- Yeah.

725
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:42,570
- Thank you for the food!
- The world sure has improved.

726
00:37:42,570 --> 00:37:46,290
The criminals dare to start eating
while the detectives are watching?

727
00:37:46,290 --> 00:37:49,890
- Oh my! What delicious looking jjajangmyun!
- Thank you for the food!

728
00:37:49,890 --> 00:37:52,650
- Thank you!
- Thanks, detectives!

729
00:37:57,530 --> 00:38:01,440
Enjoy your jjajangmyun.
You'll be eating beans and rice from now on.

730
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:04,400
- I want to eat too.
- That's what you're always saying.

731
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:07,410
Where do you live?

732
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:09,650
- You did it, didn't you?
- You did!

733
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:12,630
- You did!
- Want to confess, or get a beating first?

734
00:38:12,950 --> 00:38:15,930
- Confess or a beating first?
- Confess or a beating first?

735
00:38:17,930 --> 00:38:19,250
Wow, I'm getting so annoyed.

736
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:22,790
Hey, Lee Kwang Soo!

737
00:38:22,790 --> 00:38:24,270
What, you rascal?

738
00:38:24,270 --> 00:38:25,920
[What?]

739
00:38:29,010 --> 00:38:30,330
What did you say?

740
00:38:30,330 --> 00:38:32,890
Hey!
What? 'You rascal'?

741
00:38:32,890 --> 00:38:34,420
You dare call me a 'rascal'?

742
00:38:34,810 --> 00:38:36,610
What mommy?
(Two words sounds extremely similar.)

743
00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:39,650
Our jjajangmyun is coming!

744
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:44,220
- We ordered the jjajangmyun!
- We ordered it!

745
00:38:44,810 --> 00:38:47,600
I can't believe they deliver the food
all the way over here.

746
00:38:47,610 --> 00:38:52,590
This is going to be so delicious and to get
the chance to eat it under the lighthouse.

747
00:38:53,770 --> 00:38:56,220
- Wow, that looks so good.
- Let's eat!

748
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:59,180
- Can we start eating?
- Let's eat first.

749
00:38:59,190 --> 00:39:02,130
- It even has the pepper flakes on it.
- Wow, there's pepper flakes!

750
00:39:02,130 --> 00:39:04,650
Wow, this is amazing!

751
00:39:06,350 --> 00:39:11,920
[The delight of being able to sit down and
enjoy a bowl of jjajangmyun while working.]

752
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:18,810
- I love jjajangmyun and jjamppong together.
- This is so delicious!

753
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:27,800
- Here is your first question.
- This isn't the time for you to be eating!

754
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:29,490
[What did you say?]

755
00:39:29,490 --> 00:39:31,360
- Get up and pay attention!
- What did you say?

756
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:34,300
Did you enjoy your lunch, detectives?

757
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:36,880
Person who knows the answer will run over
to the mic and answer the question.

758
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,450
You've got 30 seconds.

759
00:39:38,450 --> 00:39:40,060
Hurry up and give us the question.

760
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:42,350
- This is a nonsense question.
- What?

761
00:39:42,910 --> 00:39:49,050
What are the two legendary dragons
that live in the arcade room?

762
00:39:49,050 --> 00:39:51,010
- I know this one!
- Answer!

763
00:39:51,010 --> 00:39:53,070
- What's your answer?
- Two dragons!

764
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:54,700
Wrong!

765
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:58,720
- It's not the two dragons?
- They don't know that answer?

766
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:01,470
- You don't know the answer to this?
- This was a good question to pick.

767
00:40:01,790 --> 00:40:05,100
- The time is ticking!
- You've only got 20 seconds left!

768
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:07,640
Answer!

769
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:10,720
- Uhm Jung Hwa?
- 'Adult dragon' (Translates to adult fantasy)

770
00:40:13,090 --> 00:40:15,280
What are you doing?

771
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,340
[Detective Uhm's incorrect answer
drawing a shocked reaction.]

772
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:19,100
How could you say that
as your answer?

773
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:23,030
- What are you saying, Jung Hwa?
- It's obviously not what the kids play.

774
00:40:23,030 --> 00:40:25,900
- How many letters in the answer?
- It's four letters.

775
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:28,450
You're running out of time.

776
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:30,380
Legendary dragons?

777
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:34,290
- Five, four, three, two...
- Wait!

778
00:40:34,290 --> 00:40:35,540
Answer!

779
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:37,270
- He might get it.
- Let's see what he says.

780
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:39,270
Ppi-yong ppi-yong!
(Yong=dragon. Play on words.)

781
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:40,970
Correct!

782
00:40:43,250 --> 00:40:45,600
[Correct]

783
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:49,240
[Detective Team Two gets the correct answer!]

784
00:40:50,650 --> 00:40:52,320
That was the correct answer!

785
00:40:53,070 --> 00:40:55,180
It's Ppi-yong ppi-young,
not ddi-yong ddi-yong.

786
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:59,150
- Our team is the best!
- This is a very hard question.

787
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:06,170
'You must never spit in front of the King'.
How would you say that in a character idiom?

788
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:10,100
- You can't spit in front of the king!
- Is that another nonsense question?

789
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:11,620
It's a nonsense question!

790
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:13,560
- Nonsense.
- You can't spit in front of the king?

791
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:15,920
- Your time starts now.
- Kim Sang Kyung?

792
00:41:16,430 --> 00:41:19,270
Yong Jae Ho Tu!

793
00:41:20,190 --> 00:41:22,880
- That's absolutely ridiculous!
- Yong Jae Ho Tu? ('Tu' as in spitting.)

794
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,670
- Yong Jae Ho Tu?
- No!

795
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:29,090
[Seriously thinking.]

796
00:41:29,090 --> 00:41:31,710
- You can't spit in front of the king?
- Answer!

797
00:41:31,710 --> 00:41:34,150
- Uhm Jung Hwa.
- Im Jeon My Twe.

798
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:37,210
Im Jeon My Twe.

799
00:41:37,210 --> 00:41:38,780
You got it right!

800
00:41:38,790 --> 00:41:40,370
[Correct answer]

801
00:41:40,510 --> 00:41:42,590
[How can this be?]

802
00:41:42,590 --> 00:41:45,590
- That's crazy! How does she know that?
- How does she even know that?

803
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:48,850
[Detective Team Two answers
the second questions in a row.]

804
00:41:50,330 --> 00:41:52,300
- What the heck.
- I'm good at things like this.

805
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:54,040
You've got some skills, LD!

806
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:56,630
This won't do.
What's the current score?

807
00:41:56,630 --> 00:41:59,160
The adult fantasy lady got
the correct answer.

808
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:04,290
This time... it's an English question.
English question!

809
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:10,900
What do you say to the king as
you bid the king farewell?

810
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:12,440
When you say farewell to a king?

811
00:42:13,010 --> 00:42:15,120
- I doubt you'll get this one.
- Answer!

812
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:16,720
- Answer?
- Bye King!

813
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:17,970
Bye King.

814
00:42:22,390 --> 00:42:24,920
[Detective Team Two gets
three questions right in a row.]

815
00:42:27,490 --> 00:42:29,710
What did you think?
Did you think that we wouldn't know?

816
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:33,230
- What the heck?
- Bye King!

817
00:42:33,230 --> 00:42:35,210
Bye King!

818
00:42:35,510 --> 00:42:39,270
What kind of a car does Girls Generation
ride around in?

819
00:42:39,270 --> 00:42:40,780
Jessi-ca! Jessi-car!

820
00:42:43,450 --> 00:42:47,910
Which member of Girls Generation has
the highest sales figure of her clothing line?

821
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:50,390
- Selling her clothes?
- Tiffany!

822
00:42:56,200 --> 00:43:00,270
Which member of Girls Generation would
sit still even if a fire breaks out?

823
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:02,540
Taeyeon!

824
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:04,870
Taeyeon!

825
00:43:04,870 --> 00:43:07,370
[We're ruined...]

826
00:43:07,660 --> 00:43:09,920
- You call these questions?
- How do they know this?

827
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:12,490
- They know all the answers!
- They're so simple-minded.

828
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:16,010
- They're so simple-minded.
- I can't believe they call those questions.

829
00:43:17,270 --> 00:43:20,100
[Too embarrassing to even deal with?]

830
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:22,660
- You can't beat us.
- You guys win.

831
00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:24,770
I can't believe the simplicity

- Bye!
- You're ousted once you're caught.

852
00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:28,300

What is it?
Open it.

862
00:45:08,350 --> 00:45:10,530
Of course, they wouldn't send us
off empty-handed.

863
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:12,760

[With the failure of their mission,
they still have 150 keys left.]

[With their composites in the detectives hands,
they can be ousted the moment they're caught.]

997
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:49,420
- Give it to me.
- What are you saying?

998
00:53:49,420 --> 00:53:53,260
What do you mean, give it to me?
What are you doing right now?

999
00:53:53,260 --> 00:53:55,210
- Back up, Jae Suk.
- Okay, Jung Hwa.

1000
00:53:55,220 --> 00:53:56,390
Give it to me.

1001

[Uhm Jung Hwa gets the tube!]

1002
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:12,380
[If he keeps this up,
he's going to dig up a well.]

1003
00:54:13,950 --> 00:54:15,240
This really hurts my feet.

1004
00:54:17,130 --> 00:54:21,530
Everyone, these Running Members...
they really do work hard.

1005
00:54:21,530 --> 00:54:23,500
I didn't know it would be like this.

1006
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:25,210
Wow... seriously!

How many boxes do we have left?

1010

dance moves rather than the mission.]

[I dance at home...]

1014
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:48,360
You're in the rhythm, Jung Hwa!

1015
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:50,270
Are you sure you don't go clubbing?

1016
00:54:50,270 --> 00:54:54,230
[Everyone, dance together!]

1017

has nine tubes!

1034

- I'm going to teach him a lesson.

1044

I'm seriously going to teach him a lesson
when I get my hands on him.

1045
00:56:43,740 --> 00:56:45,700
I can't believe we had to do that.

- Let's go!
- Let's go arrest them.

- Just the fact that we're all still alive.
- We should be happy we're all still alive.

- Let's all congratulate ourselves.
- This is as good as winning.

Congratulations, Suk Jin.
This might be our first win.

location, the nuclear exhibition hall.</i>

1061

1062

What now?
Are we eliminating them?

1063
00:57:36,910 --> 00:57:40,890
The ones we can eliminate are,
Ji Suk Jin and Ha Ha.

1064
00:57:40,890 --> 00:57:42,350
We can eliminate them for now.

1065
00:57:42,350 --> 00:57:48,310
- We can eliminate two?
- We can eliminate Suk Jin and Kwang Soo.

1066

- I only need to stay away from Jae Suk.

1075

We're good as gone
as soon as we're caught, right?

1076
00:58:15,430 --> 00:58:19,000
We're good as gone when they catch us.
So we have to find the treasure chest first.

1077

Jae Suk can't eliminate me
right now, right?

1078

and Jae Suk's team can eliminate me.

- Isn't this where they told us to go?

- Just one team can win.
- So we have to eliminate the other team too.

1096

is what's really important here.

- Okay, let's do that.

There they are.
Isn't that tall guy, Lee Kwang Soo?

Doesn't he?

[Will it be about justice or victory?]

1115
01:00:44,980 --> 01:00:47,870
I'm so confused right now.
What do I do?

1116
01:00:49,660 --> 01:00:51,930
I think I'm about to get schemed.

- Where?

1124
01:01:10,290 --> 01:01:13,420
- Are we supposed to dig?
- There was a big rock here.

1125
01:01:17,830 --> 01:01:20,180
- I bet there's something under there.
- What are you searching for?

- We don't know what we're going to find.
- What else are we supposed to do then?

1131
01:01:37,430 --> 01:01:40,560
Shouldn't we knock her out with
the shovel first or something?

1132
01:01:40,760 --> 01:01:43,140
[Say what?]

1133
01:01:43,140 --> 01:01:47,750

1157
01:03:04,510 --> 01:03:07,400
- They all ran away from you.
- How could they have abandoned me?

1158
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:10,500
[What did he expect from the guys who ran
away without even a backward glance?]

1159
01:03:10,500 --> 01:03:13,070
- That's what those guys are like.
- They didn't even look back.

1160
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:15,060
Did you bring Suk Jin's composite too?

1161
01:03:18,180 --> 01:03:20,510
I guess my composite is popular.

1162
01:03:20,510 --> 01:03:22,350
- Jung Hwa...
- I'm so upset!

1163
01:03:22,350 --> 01:03:24,620
You two were battling over
who gets to get me?

1164
01:03:24,620 --> 01:03:28,870
[Whatever the case, the first
arrest goes to Detective Team One.]

1165
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:32,970
- This really is...
- I'll see you later!

1166
01:03:33,670 --> 01:03:35,660
- What's going on? What are you doing?
- I don't know!

1167
01:03:35,660 --> 01:03:37,030
You think I'd tell you that?

1168
01:03:37,030 --> 01:03:41,140
[The criminals' big brother is arrested!
What fate awaits them?]

1169
01:03:45,990 --> 01:03:48,960
[Is Jung Hwa suddenly turning
her attack on Jae Suk?]

1170
01:03:49,410 --> 01:03:52,090
- Jung Hwa...
- I have something to tell you!

1171
01:03:52,560 --> 01:03:54,440
- I'm being serious.
- Then just tell me.

1172
01:03:54,450 --> 01:03:58,270
- I was going to oust Suk Jin earlier...
- Yes?

1173
01:03:58,700 --> 01:04:02,120
But I honestly didn't want to
do it like a coward.

1174
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:07,160
That wasn't being a coward.
Jung Hwa, I wasn't being a coward about it.

1175
01:04:07,160 --> 01:04:11,170
That wasn't what I meant.
I was about to do it then you chimed in.

1176
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:15,050
- I didn't chime in, but I went after him.
- You stole what was mine.

1177
01:04:15,050 --> 01:04:17,490
- Seriously, Jung Hwa...
- He was mine.

1178
01:04:17,490 --> 01:04:19,580
Why are you being like this?

1179
01:04:20,010 --> 01:04:22,540
- I didn't know you were like this.
- That's not right, Jung Hwa.

1180
01:04:22,780 --> 01:04:28,100
- I was just playing the game fair and square.
- How could you do that to me?

1181
01:04:28,100 --> 01:04:29,220
Jung Hwa...

1182
01:04:31,510 --> 01:04:33,730
[Suddenly falling to the ground?]

1183
01:04:34,250 --> 01:04:35,500
Jung Hwa!

1184
01:04:36,930 --> 01:04:39,390
[What is she doing?]

1185
01:04:39,790 --> 01:04:43,360
- Jae Suk! I just hurt myself.
- Where?

1186
01:04:43,690 --> 01:04:45,540
My gobang.

1187
01:04:45,540 --> 01:04:47,280
Where in the body is gobang?

1188
01:04:48,120 --> 01:04:51,730
[Gobang = Part of the knee.]

1189
01:04:51,730 --> 01:04:53,320
What's gobang?

1190
01:04:53,320 --> 01:04:56,270
What do I do?
I don't think I can even walk.

1191
01:04:57,490 --> 01:04:59,440
- You can't walk?
- No.

1192
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:01,340
- Then just stay there.
- Come help me.

1193
01:05:01,340 --> 01:05:03,710
Where are you even hurt?

1194
01:05:08,130 --> 01:05:09,550
Jung Hwa!

1195
01:05:09,890 --> 01:05:12,110
What are you doing?

1196
01:05:13,210 --> 01:05:16,290
Seriously... how do you
expect me to fall for that?

1197
01:05:19,050 --> 01:05:23,970
Seriously, Jung Hwa.
How do you expect me to fall for that?

1198
01:05:23,970 --> 01:05:25,740
Do I look like I'm laughing?

1199
01:05:26,390 --> 01:05:30,070
- I can see you're laughing right now!
- I'm crying right now!

1200
01:05:30,660 --> 01:05:33,370
- Can't you see my tears?
- I don't see any tears at all!

1201
01:05:34,370 --> 01:05:36,490
I didn't know you were like this.

1202
01:05:38,290 --> 01:05:41,330
- What are you saying, Jung Hwa?
- I didn't know you were so heartless.

1203
01:05:41,330 --> 01:05:42,500
Come here.

1204
01:05:42,870 --> 01:05:46,250
[Starts to chase after him again
after closing up the gap between them.]

1205
01:05:47,080 --> 01:05:49,230
- Jung Hwa!
- I told you to come here!

1206
01:05:49,230 --> 01:05:51,210
- How could you be like this?
- Jung Hwa!

1207
01:05:51,210 --> 01:05:52,270
Jung Hwa!

1208
01:05:52,270 --> 01:05:56,340
[They're allowed to eliminate one another.
A battle to arrest amongst the detectives.]

1209
01:05:59,890 --> 01:06:03,350
[Another show of falling down!]

1210
01:06:06,430 --> 01:06:07,740
Jung Hwa.

1211
01:06:08,740 --> 01:06:12,450
I'm serious this time.
I think I tore my ligament.

1212
01:06:13,630 --> 01:06:16,690
What... what are you doing?

1213
01:06:16,690 --> 01:06:18,950
[Slowly closing in on him.]

1214
01:06:18,950 --> 01:06:21,310
Jung Hwa, I can't do anything about this.

1215
01:06:21,880 --> 01:06:24,820
Jung Hwa, I can't do anything!

1216
01:06:27,310 --> 01:06:30,060
What?
What is it now, Jung Hwa!

1217
01:06:30,060 --> 01:06:32,560
- What is it now, Jung Hwa?
- My leg!

1218
01:06:32,980 --> 01:06:35,720
- It jammed in the doorway.
- No, it didn't.

1219
01:06:35,720 --> 01:06:37,940
I saw it.
It didn't get jammed.

1220
01:06:37,940 --> 01:06:39,440
Help me up.

1221
01:06:45,030 --> 01:06:47,800
[It's the hand this time?]

1222
01:06:48,830 --> 01:06:52,080
What are you doing?
What is all this, Jung Hwa?

1223
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:55,210
- What are you doing, Jung Hwa?
- Open the door for a second.

1224
01:06:55,840 --> 01:06:57,940
The thing we have to keep in mind

1225
01:06:57,950 --> 01:07:03,630
is that no matter who did it,
Suk Jin has been eliminated.

1226
01:07:03,640 --> 01:07:06,000
- Then share the gold with me.
- What?

1227
01:07:06,680 --> 01:07:10,810
[Detective Uhm showing her desire
for the gold winnings.]

1228
01:07:10,810 --> 01:07:14,440
- What gold are you talking about?
- I'll melt it down and make you a necklace.

1229
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:19,150
Seriously, Jung Hwa.
We're both detectives.

1230
01:07:19,150 --> 01:07:22,760
Since we're all detectives,
let's oust all the criminals first.

1231
01:07:23,310 --> 01:07:25,520
- And then we can talk.
- I want to oust you first.

1232
01:07:27,610 --> 01:07:30,760
- You're not kidding around, are you?
- I'm not joking!

1233
01:07:33,930 --> 01:07:35,590
What the heck?
What are you doing?

1234
01:07:35,590 --> 01:07:39,110
[Detective Uhm having lost her mind
over the thought of gold?]

1235
01:07:39,110 --> 01:07:41,370
- This is all your fault!
- This isn't my fault, Jung Hwa.

1236
01:07:41,370 --> 01:07:44,930
[What are the detectives doing
instead of catching the criminals?]

1237
01:07:47,080 --> 01:07:49,100
Wait.
Come on, Jung Hwa.

1238
01:07:49,100 --> 01:07:53,330
- Jung Hwa... what is it?
- You... you gripped me too hard.

1239
01:07:54,070 --> 01:07:56,520
Jung Hwa, I'm just going to leave.
I don't care what you do.

1240
01:07:56,520 --> 01:07:58,310
Okay?
I'm just going to leave.

1241
01:07:58,310 --> 01:08:00,340
If you get in my way,
I'm just going to push past you.

1242
01:08:03,030 --> 01:08:04,510
Seriously?

1243
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,460
I seriously don't know what I should do.

1244
01:08:08,460 --> 01:08:10,390
- I don't know any of the rules...
- Yes.

1245
01:08:10,390 --> 01:08:13,270
And I was going to capture Ji Suk Jin,
but you got to him first.

1246
01:08:13,270 --> 01:08:14,300
If you're like this...

1247
01:08:14,300 --> 01:08:17,540
At my age... I'm not even married.

1248
01:08:23,890 --> 01:08:25,380
Make sure to get yourself married, okay?

1249
01:08:25,850 --> 01:08:28,560
[Stay strong!]

1250
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:31,540
[Succeeds in avoiding the danger
to make his escape!]

1251
01:08:32,490 --> 01:08:33,570
Look at them.

1252
01:08:33,570 --> 01:08:37,370
[After all the whining about
not being able to stand the exertion...]

1253
01:08:37,380 --> 01:08:39,300
But look at how well she's running.

1254
01:08:39,300 --> 01:08:41,560
Her nickname is 'crybaby'.

1255
01:08:41,560 --> 01:08:44,060
- Crybaby.
- That's my new nickname for her.

1256
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:46,810
She scares me.
I'm scared of seeing her in my dreams.

1257
01:08:47,360 --> 01:08:53,240
Look at her chasing after him
with her hair flying around like that.

1258
01:08:53,240 --> 01:08:54,920
She looks like a ghost.

1259
01:08:55,440 --> 01:08:59,010
I'll go in.
I'll go in and corner them.

1260
01:08:59,410 --> 01:09:03,300
[Detective Kim goes in without
a composite!]

1261
01:09:04,630 --> 01:09:05,880
Okay!

1262
01:09:06,310 --> 01:09:07,930
Let's start the investigation!

1263
01:09:10,230 --> 01:09:11,290
Fighting!

1264
01:09:11,300 --> 01:09:15,630
[Detective Gae goes in with
Ha Ha's composite in hand.]

1265
01:09:17,110 --> 01:09:18,380
Here it is.

1266
01:09:18,830 --> 01:09:20,660
I'm going to go catch this culprit.

1267
01:09:32,330 --> 01:09:34,490
[On the other hand...]

1268
01:09:35,850 --> 01:09:39,490
[The Traitors Club hides away the bag
with all their keys in a secret place.]

1269
01:09:39,490 --> 01:09:42,860
[And makes their escape from
all the detectives.]

1270
01:09:42,860 --> 01:09:43,960
Let's go up there.

1271
01:09:43,960 --> 01:09:46,570
- I don't know. I'm running back to Seoul.
- I don't know either.

1272
01:09:49,200 --> 01:09:52,630
[Unsure who'll be making their
appearance with their composites in hand.]

1273
01:09:52,630 --> 01:09:54,340
It's a soccer field.

1274
01:09:54,660 --> 01:09:56,070
You're right.

1275
01:09:56,070 --> 01:09:57,820
Where are you guys going?

1276
01:09:58,420 --> 01:10:01,300
- Let's talk. Let's talk.
- You want to talk?

1277
01:10:01,300 --> 01:10:02,310
Yes.

1278
01:10:03,650 --> 01:10:09,070
[Criminals and the detectives conversing
with a net separating them.]

1279
01:10:09,070 --> 01:10:11,180
I've really missed you, Jae Suk.

1280
01:10:11,230 --> 01:10:14,110
You guys... are you guys even
getting to eat?

1281
01:10:14,110 --> 01:10:15,740
We haven't had anything to eat.

1282
01:10:15,740 --> 01:10:17,840
- We've really missed you.
- Who's composite do you have?

1283
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:19,850
- I see someone else coming.
- Turn yourselves in.

1284
01:10:19,850 --> 01:10:23,030
- Just surrender and turn yourselves in.
- What have we done that's so wrong?

1285
01:10:23,430 --> 01:10:26,200
- We'll help you beat the other team.
- We can't eliminate anyone.

1286
01:10:26,200 --> 01:10:28,100
Let's really talk.
That team has Kim Jong Kook.

1287
01:10:28,100 --> 01:10:29,410
How do you plan on taking care of him?

1288
01:10:29,410 --> 01:10:31,220
We'll take care of him.

1289
01:10:31,690 --> 01:10:36,360
- You guys are just so dense!
- You guys being like this...

1290
01:10:36,360 --> 01:10:38,300
This is why you never win!

1291
01:10:38,300 --> 01:10:40,830
- It's not like that.
- I'll surrender myself to you.

1292
01:10:40,830 --> 01:10:42,610
I'll sacrifice myself for you guys.

1293
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:45,840
I don't need that.

1294
01:10:49,570 --> 01:10:52,050
- We don't need that.
- I'll give you Ha Ha's other hand too!

1295
01:10:53,540 --> 01:10:58,450
[Traitor Giraffe sacrificing
his own comrade, Ha Ha.]

1296
01:10:58,450 --> 01:11:01,410
- That's why...
- Wow, that really hurts.

1297
01:11:02,390 --> 01:11:04,510
[Just then!]

1298
01:11:04,520 --> 01:11:07,990
[Detective Team Two with
Ha Ha's composite joins the scene.]

1299
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:11,050
- I see everyone's here now.
- Sorry, Gary. I have Jae Suk here for you!

1300
01:11:12,490 --> 01:11:14,820
- Wait!
- I'm holding onto both of Jae Suk's hand!

1301
01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:18,760
[Kwang Soo is eliciting the detectives
to fight amongst themselves!]

1302
01:11:18,760 --> 01:11:20,190
- I got him!
- Hurry, Jung Hwa!

1303
01:11:26,700 --> 01:11:31,060
[Detective Team Two's Jung Hwa
eliminates Jae Suk's name tag!]

1304
01:11:31,060 --> 01:11:34,560
Jung Hwa, remember that
we helped you!

1305
01:11:34,900 --> 01:11:36,360
[This pair is in a total uproar.]

1306
01:11:39,910 --> 01:11:41,640
We shouldn't be fighting
amongst ourselves!

1307
01:11:45,240 --> 01:11:49,010
[Traitors Club uses this moment
to make their escape!]

1308
01:11:49,010 --> 01:11:50,390
Jung Hwa!

1309
01:11:51,260 --> 01:11:55,120
I'm not your enemy!
Why did you eliminate me?

1310
01:11:55,120 --> 01:11:57,260
Why?
You want me to put it back on?

1311
01:11:57,810 --> 01:12:02,170
[Gary hands his composite of
Ha Ha over to Jung Hwa.]

1312
01:12:02,690 --> 01:12:05,950
- You two need to work together for now.
- Those sneaky foxes.

1313
01:12:05,950 --> 01:12:07,890
I can't believe he held me down
by holding onto my hand.

1314
01:12:07,890 --> 01:12:10,320
That Lee Kwang Soo.
You two stay alive, okay?

1315
01:12:10,650 --> 01:12:12,760
- You two work together for now.
- Bye!

1316
01:12:13,770 --> 01:12:16,360
- Jung Hwa.
- You shouldn't be happy about eliminating me!

1317
01:12:17,780 --> 01:12:20,200
You really are no joke!

1318
01:12:20,210 --> 01:12:21,860
- Gary...
- After all the complaining about being tired!

1319
01:12:21,860 --> 01:12:25,950
What have you said to Jung Hwa for her
to come after me like that?

1320
01:12:25,950 --> 01:12:28,990
We haven't told her anything.
We just gave her a glance.

1321
01:12:28,990 --> 01:12:31,330
[Ripping off the name tags is fun!]

1322
01:12:32,860 --> 01:12:35,700
I wouldn't be surprised if Jung Hwa rips off
Jong Kook's name tag at this rate.

1323
01:12:35,700 --> 01:12:40,230
- She doesn't even know the rules!
- Yes, I do! I was told to rip off Jae Suk's.

1324
01:12:40,230 --> 01:12:42,490
You can't rip off Jong Kook's, okay?

1325
01:12:44,150 --> 01:12:46,690
Just because you think it's fun to do it,
you can't go around ripping his off!

1326
01:12:46,690 --> 01:12:48,850
I wouldn't put it past her if she did.

1327
01:12:48,850 --> 01:12:50,560
She's all about ripping off
the name tags now.

1328
01:12:51,490 --> 01:12:53,580
[On the other hand...]

1329
01:12:54,650 --> 01:12:59,400
[The criminals searching behind the stage
as told in the instructions.]

1330
01:12:59,400 --> 01:13:02,940
[Something has to be in the ground!]

1331
01:13:02,940 --> 01:13:04,910
- There's too much dirt.
- Move over, I'll do it too.

1332
01:13:05,550 --> 01:13:07,450
- Here! I feel something!
- You hit something!

1333
01:13:07,450 --> 01:13:08,870
Good, good.

1334
01:13:08,870 --> 01:13:10,240
Let's do this quickly.

1335
01:13:10,240 --> 01:13:11,360
Let's hurry it up.

1336
01:13:11,360 --> 01:13:14,200
Okay, we're doing good.
I don't see anyone around.

1337
01:13:15,160 --> 01:13:16,820
I don't see anyone, Kwang Soo.
No one is around right now.

1338
01:13:17,660 --> 01:13:20,070
Let's hurry.
Quickly.

1339
01:13:22,290 --> 01:13:28,440
[A case with a lock is found
under the ground!]

1340
01:13:28,440 --> 01:13:30,030
We just need to find the right key
out of the 140 keys that we have.

1341
01:13:30,030 --> 01:13:34,110
[Just needs to open the lock with
the correct key!]

1342
01:13:41,290 --> 01:13:45,150
[Retrieving the 140 keys that
they hid away earlier.]

1343
01:13:45,630 --> 01:13:47,140
We just have to find the right one.

1344
01:13:52,120 --> 01:13:54,170
Let's go in.
Shut all the doors.

1345
01:13:55,910 --> 01:13:58,480
[Going further into the back of
the room to conceal themselves.]

1346
01:14:01,480 --> 01:14:04,080
Let's do this. Even though I don't know
what's in here, let's see what we've got.

1347
01:14:06,500 --> 01:14:07,800
There are too many keys.

1348
01:14:08,380 --> 01:14:10,000
Look at all this, Ha Ha.

1349
01:14:10,850 --> 01:14:14,260
[Only one of these is the correct key!]

1350
01:14:14,260 --> 01:14:15,360
Let's unravel them.

1351
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:19,360
This is it.
It's this shaped key.

1352
01:14:19,990 --> 01:14:22,870
It would be amazing if it's the first key.

1353
01:14:25,850 --> 01:14:28,260
This one isn't the one.

1354
01:14:28,260 --> 01:14:29,830
Let's try number two.

1355
01:14:29,830 --> 01:14:33,180
[And key number two?]

1356
01:14:33,180 --> 01:14:35,210
[That's not it either...]

1357
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:39,970
It's not this one either.

1358
01:14:40,950 --> 01:14:44,200
[When are they going to try them all?]

1359
01:14:45,530 --> 01:14:50,810
[30 minutes have passed.
Time for Detective Kkuk to go in!]

1360
01:14:50,810 --> 01:14:55,260
[Detective Blank goes in with
Kwang Soo's composite in hand!]

1361
01:14:55,560 --> 01:14:57,610
I'm going in to get Lee Kwang Soo.

1362
01:14:58,570 --> 01:14:59,910
I'm going in.

1363
01:15:04,450 --> 01:15:06,810
What if they went up on the roof?

1364
01:15:09,470 --> 01:15:11,100
Was something there?

1365
01:15:11,500 --> 01:15:13,450
I think there was something here.

1366
01:15:13,450 --> 01:15:14,590
[Discovers a patch of dirt that
looks to have been disturbed!]

1367
01:15:14,590 --> 01:15:16,130
What were they digging for?

1368
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:19,160
Gold?

1369
01:15:22,140 --> 01:15:25,490
I really thought that Gary was
going to remain alive.

1370
01:15:25,500 --> 01:15:28,640
- What did you say?
- Sang Kyung rushed in on me.

1371
01:15:28,640 --> 01:15:30,710
Jong Kook, you told me to attack
Jae Suk, right?

1372
01:15:32,770 --> 01:15:34,750
You told me to attack Jae Suk, right?

1373
01:15:36,560 --> 01:15:38,030
When?

1374
01:15:39,180 --> 01:15:41,290
- Come on.
- What the heck!

1375
01:15:41,290 --> 01:15:45,780
[Everything was ordered by
Detective Kkuk of Detective Team Two?]

1376
01:15:45,780 --> 01:15:46,840
You just wait and see!

1377
01:15:47,230 --> 01:15:48,600
- See what?
- You did, right?

1378
01:15:48,600 --> 01:15:50,730
- You did good, Jung Hwa.
- You did, right?

1379
01:15:50,730 --> 01:15:53,440
- You did the right thing.
- Jae Suk asked me why I ousted him.

1380
01:15:53,440 --> 01:15:56,810
So when he asked me that,
I started doubting if I did the right thing.

1381
01:15:56,810 --> 01:15:58,190
No, you did the right thing.

1382
01:15:58,540 --> 01:16:04,080
I saw the three of them earlier
digging at the patch of dirt over there.

1383
01:16:04,080 --> 01:16:07,460
- The ground is sunk in. They were digging.
- I'm sure they found something.

1384
01:16:07,460 --> 01:16:09,940
- We have to find out what it was.
- Did they take my gold?

1385
01:16:09,940 --> 01:16:12,090
- My gold. Could it be my gold?
- Huh?

1386
01:16:12,090 --> 01:16:13,430
Okay, Jung Hwa.
I'll find it.

1387
01:16:13,880 --> 01:16:15,580
- Let's work together.
- Sang Kyung!

1388
01:16:15,580 --> 01:16:17,640
- Lets work together.
- Let me tell you something first.

1389
01:16:17,640 --> 01:16:20,590
Since I've been in these situations
many a times before...

1390
01:16:20,590 --> 01:16:22,180
- Let me tell you what we should do.
- Work together.

1391
01:16:22,180 --> 01:16:24,080
The first thing to do right now
is to capture the criminals.

1392
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:26,540
The reason being,
Im sure that they have a mission to do.

1393
01:16:26,540 --> 01:16:29,260
If they complete the mission
while we're fighting amongst ourselves

1394
01:16:29,270 --> 01:16:31,690
then it's all over for both
you and I.

1395
01:16:31,690 --> 01:16:35,060
- The detectives need to win.
- Let's go capture the criminals first.

1396
01:16:35,060 --> 01:16:36,360
- Okay.
- A joint investigation.

1397
01:16:36,360 --> 01:16:37,580
- Joint investigation.
- Together.

1398
01:16:37,580 --> 01:16:39,830
- Let's work together on this.
- This is what you call a joint investigation.

1399
01:16:39,830 --> 01:16:41,070
Yes, a joint investigation.

1400
01:16:41,070 --> 01:16:44,060
We've decided to do a joint investigation.

1401
01:16:44,060 --> 01:16:47,920
[Surviving detectives are in agreement to join
their forces together to make the arrest.]

1402
01:16:47,920 --> 01:16:50,960
- We have to work together and get them.
- Okay.

1403
01:16:50,960 --> 01:16:54,330
Let's take care of those two first
before we do anything between ourselves.

1404
01:16:54,330 --> 01:16:56,130
- Let's not do anything until then.
- Okay, promise.

1405
01:16:56,130 --> 01:16:57,810
Let's promise each other.
- No attacking each other.

1406
01:16:59,350 --> 01:17:01,300
- Look at these guys.
- I was just playing.

1407
01:17:01,680 --> 01:17:04,910
You need to familiarize yourself
about Running Man a bit more.

1408
01:17:05,180 --> 01:17:07,540
- Familiarize yourself more.
- Stop this. I'm a detective.

1409
01:17:07,930 --> 01:17:09,350
- Okay?
- Okay.

1410
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:13,470
- These are all the same.
- Let's try this one.

1411
01:17:13,880 --> 01:17:15,350
Let's try all of these one at a time.

1412
01:17:15,960 --> 01:17:20,450
[Instead of trying things at random,
decides to try them one at a time.]

1413
01:17:21,400 --> 01:17:24,050
We have to try the right shaped ones.

1414
01:17:24,050 --> 01:17:25,710
Let's try this one.
Okay, it's not this one.

1415
01:17:25,710 --> 01:17:27,140
How about this one?

1416
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:32,020
Number 83.

1417
01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:40,320
[Since they've worked so hard all day,
today may be the day!]

1418
01:17:40,320 --> 01:17:42,340
We're miracles for having
survived until now.

1419
01:17:43,690 --> 01:17:46,820
[Every single one of them is a dud!]

1420
01:17:47,670 --> 01:17:52,250
[they can't even remember which
of the keys that they've tried.]

1421
01:17:52,860 --> 01:17:56,600
We don't have much time.
We're dead if Jong Kook shows up.

1422
01:17:58,100 --> 01:17:59,400
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

1423
01:17:59,400 --> 01:18:00,640
We have to hurry.

1424
01:18:11,790 --> 01:18:14,500
[I hear something jingling...]

1425
01:18:21,880 --> 01:18:23,310
I smell something.

1426
01:18:23,740 --> 01:18:25,120
I can smell something.

1427
01:18:25,120 --> 01:18:28,480
What's this smell?
I smell something!

1428
01:18:28,480 --> 01:18:30,410
I can smell something!

1429
01:18:30,410 --> 01:18:34,830
[Sang Kyung discovers the criminals!]

1430
01:18:34,830 --> 01:18:36,400
[Detective Uhm also barges her way in!]

1431
01:18:36,400 --> 01:18:38,250
- Show us the evidence!
- Do you have any evidence?

1432
01:18:38,250 --> 01:18:43,420
[Detective Uhm reaches for her
composite of Ha Ha!]

1433
01:18:43,420 --> 01:18:45,380
[Just then...]

1434
01:18:46,260 --> 01:18:54,040
[In the midst of all the chaos...
reaches for her name tag!]

1435
01:18:57,380 --> 01:18:58,640
Do you have any evidence?

1436
01:18:58,650 --> 01:19:00,000
Do you have evidence?

1437
01:19:02,590 --> 01:19:06,180
[Sang Kyung eliminates
Jung Hwa's name tag.]

1438
01:19:06,180 --> 01:19:09,350
[Mental meltdown.]

1439
01:19:10,040 --> 01:19:11,730
- Do you have evidence?
- Jong Kook!

1440
01:19:11,730 --> 01:19:15,300
[Detective Kkuk rushing in after
hearing all the commotion.]

1441
01:19:16,440 --> 01:19:18,900
- You're in trouble now.
- Come on...

1442
01:19:18,900 --> 01:19:20,670
- Why are you out?
- He did it!

1443
01:19:20,680 --> 01:19:23,020
- He did it!
- Sang Kyung ousted her!

1444
01:19:23,020 --> 01:19:24,420
- Jong Kook!
- Sang Kyung ousted her!

1445
01:19:24,420 --> 01:19:28,360
[Even after being ousted,
Detective Uhm throws a fit.]

1446
01:19:28,360 --> 01:19:30,430
- Come out here, Jung Hwa.
- This is unfair!

1447
01:19:30,430 --> 01:19:32,030
Jung Hwa, you have to get out of there.

1448
01:19:32,030 --> 01:19:34,390
[Pulling out all the tricks
right up to the very end.]

1449
01:19:34,810 --> 01:19:37,000
- You can kill us at any time, Jong Kook.
- Why did you do that, Sang Kyung?

1450
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,550
- Why are you being like this?
- I can't understand why you did that.

1451
01:19:39,550 --> 01:19:40,980
- Wait...
- Sang Kyung!

1452
01:19:41,260 --> 01:19:44,290
That's so unfair!
So this is what happens?

1453
01:19:44,830 --> 01:19:46,550
This is so annoying!

1454
01:19:51,080 --> 01:19:55,230
[Traitors Club uses this moment
to make their escape!]

1455
01:19:56,120 --> 01:19:57,490
- No!
- Why did you do that?

1456
01:19:57,490 --> 01:19:59,730
[What are you doing?
The criminals have escaped!]

1457
01:19:59,730 --> 01:20:01,070
- Why did you do that?
- Come on.

1458
01:20:01,070 --> 01:20:03,060
- It's all a big misunderstanding.
- What's a misunderstanding?

1459
01:20:03,060 --> 01:20:05,460
- What's a misunderstanding?
- Her back was right in front of me.

1460
01:20:06,470 --> 01:20:08,900
Her back was right in front of me.
No, you can't do this.

1461
01:20:08,910 --> 01:20:12,700
- Let's catch them together.
- Yes, we should. So why did you do that?

1462
01:20:12,700 --> 01:20:15,840
- And to a fragile woman!
- It was right in front of me. Right in front!

1463
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:18,650
- But still!
- What else was I supposed to do?

1464
01:20:18,650 --> 01:20:20,210
It was just sitting there
right in front of me.

1465
01:20:21,570 --> 01:20:25,300
[At this rate,
the detectives are going to oust each other!]

1466
01:20:25,300 --> 01:20:26,990
- Rip off his name tag!
- Wait! Stop it for a moment.

1467
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,960
This isn't the time for us to be
fighting like this!

1468
01:20:29,960 --> 01:20:32,310
- I'm saying we should do it together.
- Why did you do that?

1469
01:20:32,320 --> 01:20:35,490
This really isn't the time for us
to be behaving like this right now.

1470
01:20:35,490 --> 01:20:38,150
Just ousting each other isn't
going to get anything done, Sang Kyung.

1471
01:20:38,150 --> 01:20:40,160
We have to get rid of them first.

1472
01:20:40,790 --> 01:20:44,490
[Detective Kim just trying to
get himself out of his situation.]

1473
01:20:45,070 --> 01:20:47,250
What else was I supposed to do
when it was right in front of me?

1474
01:20:47,250 --> 01:20:50,060
- Even if it was in front of you!
- I thought it was there for me to rip off.

1475
01:20:50,070 --> 01:20:51,780
That's all it was.
This is all a misunderstanding.

1476
01:20:51,790 --> 01:20:54,180
Why did you rip it off?
This is a joint investigation.

1477
01:20:54,180 --> 01:20:57,400
Aside from that, it was just waiting for me
to rip off of her back.

1478
01:20:57,400 --> 01:20:59,490
Do you have Ha Ha's composite, Jong Kook?

1479
01:20:59,490 --> 01:21:01,950
- Yeah.
- In that case, let's do this.

1480
01:21:01,950 --> 01:21:03,770
- Let's seriously...
- Catch them.

1481
01:21:04,140 --> 01:21:07,830
- What's wrong with you?
- I had them trapped!

1482
01:21:07,830 --> 01:21:10,120
Both of them!
I had both of them here!

1483
01:21:10,120 --> 01:21:13,980
- Let's just go.
- What are we all doing here?

1484
01:21:13,980 --> 01:21:17,460
This isn't the time for this right now.
Those guys have some of the keys.

1485
01:21:17,460 --> 01:21:19,710
If they open up that treasure chest,
everything will be over!

1486
01:21:19,710 --> 01:21:21,000
Okay, let's go.

1487
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:25,430
[Calling a temporary truce as
Detective Blank says and heads back out.]

1488
01:21:25,430 --> 01:21:26,860
I can see that you're really angry.

1489
01:21:27,680 --> 01:21:30,160
I'm telling you,
I had them both cornered.

1490
01:21:30,520 --> 01:21:32,720
You shouldn't have taken so long
to get over here.

1491
01:21:34,070 --> 01:21:37,510
You should've gotten here faster.
I got frustrated just waiting around.

1492
01:21:37,510 --> 01:21:39,930
[Just will this joint investigation end?]

1493
01:21:39,930 --> 01:21:41,110
Hurry!

1494
01:21:41,650 --> 01:21:43,750
[Right around the same time]

1495
01:21:45,310 --> 01:21:48,920
[Traitors Club having escaped
their certain demise.]

1496
01:21:48,920 --> 01:21:50,040
If it's not one of these,
then we're dead.

1497
01:21:50,040 --> 01:21:54,300
[Still haven't been able to find the key
that opens up the treasure chest.]

1498
01:21:54,300 --> 01:21:55,960
Please!
This isn't the one.

1499
01:21:57,420 --> 01:21:58,520
It won't fit?

1500
01:22:00,810 --> 01:22:02,380
It's not turning!

1501
01:22:02,380 --> 01:22:05,530
[The time is ticking,
but they can't find the right one!]

1502
01:22:05,540 --> 01:22:08,340
Kwang Soo, we're almost there!
We're almost there, Suk Jin!

1503
01:22:08,340 --> 01:22:12,950
[The two criminals slowly starting
to lose their minds.]

1504
01:22:12,950 --> 01:22:14,650
- We have to win today.
- Please!

1505
01:22:17,530 --> 01:22:19,250
We don't have time.
Kim Jong Kook is still alive.

1506
01:22:28,610 --> 01:22:31,080
[Detective Kkuk is closing in!]

1507
01:22:31,620 --> 01:22:35,170
[Getting ready to run again with
all their lights turned off.]

1508
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,700
Come here, Lee Kwang Soo.
Lee Kwang Soo, come here!

1509
01:22:42,190 --> 01:22:43,640
Come here, Lee Kwang Soo.
Hey!

1510
01:22:44,180 --> 01:22:45,400
Lee Kwang Soo, listen to me.

1511
01:22:45,400 --> 01:22:51,720
[Does Detective Kkuk really have
something to say to the Giraffe?]

1512
01:22:51,720 --> 01:22:53,310
I want to get Kim Sang Kyung.

1513
01:22:53,310 --> 01:22:54,990
Okay?
I'll pretend that I've captured you.

1514
01:22:54,990 --> 01:22:56,330
- Hurry.
- Okay, how?

1515
01:22:56,330 --> 01:23:01,950
[Is Detective Kkuk planning on using
Kwang Soo to eliminate Sang Kyung?]

1516
01:23:02,880 --> 01:23:04,170
Hang on!

1517
01:23:04,170 --> 01:23:06,210
- Come on, Jong Kook.
- Who has Kwang Soo's composite?

1518
01:23:06,210 --> 01:23:08,250
[The Tiger and the Giraffe really can
work very well together at times.]

1519
01:23:09,060 --> 01:23:10,340
Hurry!

1520
01:23:10,370 --> 01:23:12,700
[Sang Kyung walks towards them
without suspecting anything.]

1521
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,810
- Okay, I got it. I got him!
- What?

1522
01:23:16,600 --> 01:23:19,410
[Detective Kkuk attacks Detective Kim!]

1523
01:23:19,410 --> 01:23:20,580
Watch out!

1524
01:23:22,530 --> 01:23:24,180
- Dong Hoon!
- What are you doing?

1525
01:23:24,580 --> 01:23:26,870
- Dong Hoon!
- Hey! Kwang Soo!

1526
01:23:26,870 --> 01:23:28,950
Why are you betraying me after
telling me not to betray you?

1527
01:23:28,950 --> 01:23:32,480
[Joint investigation once again
comes to a ruin.]

1528
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:34,770
- Seriously.
- You need to feel what it's like too.

1529
01:23:34,770 --> 01:23:36,160
But this is different
than what happened to me.

1530
01:23:36,160 --> 01:23:39,460
I was about to catch the guys,
but her name tag appeared in front of me.

1531
01:23:39,700 --> 01:23:43,050
I just did what I did out of curiosity
because I was frustrated from the waiting.

1532
01:23:43,130 --> 01:23:45,530
This really isn't the time for us
to be doing this, Jong Kook.

1533
01:23:45,530 --> 01:23:49,860
Those two running off like they did
means that they've found something.

1534
01:23:50,050 --> 01:23:52,830
- This isn't the time for this, Sang Kyung!
- I know.

1535
01:23:52,830 --> 01:23:54,560
- What's wrong with you?
- Why am I the only one thinking?

1536
01:23:54,560 --> 01:23:56,030
You're the one who started this!

1537
01:23:56,430 --> 01:23:58,570
Both of you stop it!

1538
01:23:58,570 --> 01:24:02,420
- Let's just go find them together.
- We should've done that from the beginning!

1539
01:24:02,420 --> 01:24:04,140
- Then we wouldn't have this problem!
- That's what I'm saying too!

1540
01:24:04,140 --> 01:24:06,190
You two figure it out
and come when you're done.

1541
01:24:06,200 --> 01:24:08,080
- You two figure it out.
- Let's go.

1542
01:24:09,060 --> 01:24:13,810
[Atmosphere of walking on thin ice.]

1543
01:24:13,810 --> 01:24:15,240
You have a weird glint in your eye.

1544
01:24:15,240 --> 01:24:16,890
You're going to betray me again, aren't you?

1545
01:24:16,890 --> 01:24:19,560
- Let's end this later.
- Okay.

1546
01:24:19,560 --> 01:24:21,120
That's what I'm saying.

1547
01:24:21,430 --> 01:24:24,440
- Are we working together again?
- Lets end this right here.

1548
01:24:24,440 --> 01:24:27,000
[Declaration of a duel!]

1549
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:28,650
This is unfair.
I have a bad feeling.

1550
01:24:29,730 --> 01:24:33,670
You've been doing this for three years,
so I'm sure you're more skilled than I am.

1551
01:24:34,010 --> 01:24:37,660
- All I've done is sing ballads.
- I'm a ballad singer too!

1552
01:24:37,660 --> 01:24:39,880
- You know what I meant.
- I'm a ballad singer too!

1553
01:24:39,890 --> 01:24:42,160
- But you've danced too.
- I'm a ballad singer.

1554
01:24:42,250 --> 01:24:47,580
[Competitiveness that can't be avoided.
What will come of this?]

1555
01:24:47,580 --> 01:24:50,100
Let's just end this here, Sang Kyung!

1556
01:24:50,100 --> 01:24:52,280
Let's just end this here, and move on.

1557
01:24:52,280 --> 01:24:54,100
Let's just end this.

1558
01:24:54,980 --> 01:24:56,770
[They're finally going at it!]

1559
01:25:00,640 --> 01:25:06,540
[I'm... the one... who'll catch the thieves!]

1560
01:25:06,540 --> 01:25:09,730
[Who will be the man that will
become the ultimate detective?]

1561
01:25:17,260 --> 01:25:22,210
[Sang Kyung...
eliminates Jong Kook's name!]

1562
01:25:22,220 --> 01:25:25,940
[Detective Kkuk of DT2 is out!]

1563
01:25:25,940 --> 01:25:28,200
I told you that we should do it together.
You should've listen to me.

1564
01:25:28,200 --> 01:25:30,840
I told you we should work together.
I told you that repeatedly.

1565
01:25:31,210 --> 01:25:33,540
I told you that I'm a ballad singer.

1566
01:25:34,170 --> 01:25:36,720
Everyone, I'm a ballad singer.

1567
01:25:36,990 --> 01:25:39,890
I guess... I'll go catch the others now.

1568
01:25:41,230 --> 01:25:42,900
Give me the composite.

1569
01:25:44,370 --> 01:25:48,830
[Giving up the composite of Ha Ha
over to Sang Kyung.]

1570
01:25:48,830 --> 01:25:50,910
- I didn't know.
- I'm a ballad singer, and I'll catch them.

1571
01:25:50,910 --> 01:25:53,550
I'll go take care of them.
Thanks.

1572
01:25:57,530 --> 01:25:59,460
I had my grip on him,
but I grabbed his hood instead.

1573
01:25:59,460 --> 01:26:01,460
I thought his hood was the name tag.

1574
01:26:01,460 --> 01:26:03,810
His hood was in the way of
his name tag!

1575
01:26:04,670 --> 01:26:10,350
[On the other hand...
the criminals...]

1576
01:26:11,600 --> 01:26:15,560
[Ha Ha hiding in the corner
of some random office.]

1577
01:26:15,560 --> 01:26:16,950
Everyone, hide!

1578
01:26:19,820 --> 01:26:23,910
[Still not sure which one of them
is the correct key.]

1579
01:26:24,400 --> 01:26:26,690
- Dong Hoon!
- Hey! Over here. Come over here.

1580
01:26:28,060 --> 01:26:29,520
How did you escape?

1581
01:26:32,540 --> 01:26:34,870
- Kwang Soo, how did you escape?
- Dong Hoon!

1582
01:26:34,870 --> 01:26:37,110
[The two criminals are back
together again!]

1583
01:26:37,110 --> 01:26:40,990
Jong Kook proposed that I help him
eliminate Kim Sang Kyung.

1584
01:26:40,990 --> 01:26:43,190
- I seized the moment to escape.
- Good job.

1585
01:26:45,130 --> 01:26:48,570
[Not may keys left for them to try.]

1586
01:26:55,860 --> 01:26:57,650
Wait, I think this is turning.

1587
01:26:59,430 --> 01:27:01,950
[It opened!]

1588
01:27:02,830 --> 01:27:04,350
Number 43.
It was number 43.

1589
01:27:09,700 --> 01:27:12,010
[A large note is inside the case?]

1590
01:27:18,180 --> 01:27:22,120
[But nothing is written into the booklet...
This is the treasure?]

1591
01:27:22,120 --> 01:27:23,790
Here's another death note.

1592
01:27:26,460 --> 01:27:32,310
['Only one person can utilize this'?]

1593
01:27:36,210 --> 01:27:39,070
[Giraffe's hand slowly moves
up Ha Ha's back.]

1594
01:27:42,110 --> 01:27:45,450
[Giraffe ousts Ha Ha!]

1595
01:27:46,060 --> 01:27:51,040
[Since only one person can utilize it...]

1596
01:27:55,070 --> 01:27:59,720
[The Traitors Club with a firm
understanding of how betrayals work.]

1597
01:28:02,550 --> 01:28:04,170
I didn't win this alone.

1598
01:28:05,530 --> 01:28:07,190
We won this together.

1599
01:28:11,040 --> 01:28:13,270
I smell something here.

1600
01:28:13,590 --> 01:28:16,180
[Detective Kim chooses that moment
to barge in on them.]

1601
01:28:18,360 --> 01:28:20,550
I can smell something in here.

1602
01:28:20,960 --> 01:28:22,810
[Detective Team One's plan
to capture their criminals.]

1603
01:28:22,810 --> 01:28:24,510
Dong Hoon, make your escape.
Run, Dong Hoon.

1604
01:28:24,510 --> 01:28:26,080
I said, make your escape!

1605
01:28:26,980 --> 01:28:29,420
Without Jong Kook here, Ha Ha is safe.

1606
01:28:31,600 --> 01:28:35,210
[Must write his name on the line
for him to be the winner!]

1607
01:28:36,800 --> 01:28:38,510
Ha Ha's already ousted?

1608
01:28:39,570 --> 01:28:41,210
Wait!
Wait!

1609
01:28:41,210 --> 01:28:46,510
[The Giraffe is captured the moment he
gets ready to write down his name.]

1610
01:28:46,510 --> 01:28:49,060
Please!
Please let me win just this once!

1611
01:28:49,060 --> 01:28:51,470
I'm right there!
I'm right in front of my victory!

1612
01:28:51,470 --> 01:28:53,840
I don't have anything.
Hurry up and eliminate his name tag.

1613
01:28:53,840 --> 01:28:55,510
Just do it.
Hurry up and do it.

1614
01:28:55,520 --> 01:28:57,510
- Hurry up and do it.
- Ji Hyo, please!

1615
01:28:57,510 --> 01:28:59,670
Please!
Please, Ji Hyo!

1616
01:28:59,670 --> 01:29:05,170
[Detective Blank of DT1
completes the roundup!]

1617
01:29:06,060 --> 01:29:08,110
I even wrote down my last name!

1618
01:29:09,080 --> 01:29:11,160
- All you had to do was write your name?
- I just needed to write in 'Kwang Soo'!

1619
01:29:11,160 --> 01:29:13,060
- You just had to write your name?
- I'm glad this happened!

1620
01:29:13,060 --> 01:29:15,560
- This is your punishment!
- You are a joke!

1621
01:29:15,560 --> 01:29:19,210
[A fitting ending for the traitors.]

1622
01:29:19,210 --> 01:29:21,720
- Let's see how well you end up!
- I'll see you in jail!

1623
01:29:23,260 --> 01:29:28,330
[Traitors Club once again self-destructs
from their own betrayals...]

1624
01:29:33,980 --> 01:29:37,080
[How was anything going to work out
with this type of teamwork?]

1625
01:29:38,200 --> 01:29:41,550
[Winners! Detective Blank
and Detective Kim enters!]

1626
01:29:43,610 --> 01:29:45,890
- You're so greedy!
- You scribbled out my name?

1627
01:29:45,890 --> 01:29:50,140
[Ji Hyo already wrote in her name
where Kwang Soo's name would've been.]

1628
01:29:51,130 --> 01:29:54,280
I had no idea it would end like this.

1629
01:29:54,280 --> 01:29:56,540
- We've all been betrayed.
- We're the winning team.

1630
01:29:56,540 --> 01:30:01,720
<i>The note is a promise of making a special
episode that would star Song Ji Hyo.</i>

1631
01:30:01,720 --> 01:30:05,250
[The treasure is a promise to write a special
which would star Song Ji Hyo.]

1632
01:30:05,310 --> 01:30:08,190
- Thank you.
- Great job, detectives!

1633
01:30:08,190 --> 01:30:10,860
