168
00:09:42,077 --> 00:09:43,826
[Passing on the rap portion of the song.]

169
00:09:45,989 --> 00:09:49,463
[The original singer of the song, Gary
with the mic in his hand.]

170
00:09:50,551 --> 00:09:52,014
[He's doing great!]

171
00:09:57,069 --> 00:09:59,235
[Suddenly turning into Leessang's stage.]

172
00:10:04,167 --> 00:10:07,398
[Yeah, Monday Theater!]

173
00:10:08,489 --> 00:10:10,027
What is it?

174
00:10:10,571 --> 00:10:13,441
- Wow, I can't stand him.
- Isn't that a picture of his arm?

175
00:10:15,872 --> 00:10:18,117
[A warning?
A frightening picture of Kkuk's biceps.]

176
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:21,085
- I think what he's trying to do is...
- Why did he send us that picture?

177
00:10:21,086 --> 00:10:23,434
- I think I know what he's doing.
- What?

178
00:10:23,435 --> 00:10:25,503
- He's saying he'll pull up the car...
- And he wants you all to get in?

179
00:10:25,504 --> 00:10:27,189
- He wants all of us to get in his car.
- He sent me a text too.

180
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:29,761
- He sent me one too.
- I bet he sent it to everyone.

181
00:10:29,762 --> 00:10:31,202
I can't believe he's doing that.

182
00:10:31,666 --> 00:10:35,920
[Captain Kkuk's team feeling nervous
from lack of team members.]

183
00:10:37,766 --> 00:10:39,984
[Captain Yoo and his teammates caught
walking out by Captain Kkuk.]

184
00:10:39,985 --> 00:10:41,381
- Is he here?
- It's Kim Jong Kook.

185
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:44,340
- My doors are unlocked.
- What did you say?

186
00:10:44,341 --> 00:10:45,748
I want you to know
that my doors are unlocked.

187
00:10:45,749 --> 00:10:47,412
What?
You said your doors are unlocked?

188
00:10:47,413 --> 00:10:49,987
We'll pull over right there
and park the car.

189
00:10:49,988 --> 00:10:51,580
- You're blocking the traffic.
- You guys decide what you want to do.

190
00:10:51,581 --> 00:10:53,093
What are you all doing?
Get in the car.

191
00:10:53,094 --> 00:10:55,223
- Hurry up and get in.
- Give us a minute.

192
00:10:55,889 --> 00:10:59,656
[All the members starting to doubt
upon seeing Tiger's appearance.]

193
00:10:59,657 --> 00:11:01,181
- Song Ji Hyo.
- This is going to be tough.

194
00:11:01,182 --> 00:11:02,514
Don't forget that I came all the way
here just to pick you up.

195
00:11:02,515 --> 00:11:04,151
Hey, you were the first person
I picked up.

196
00:11:04,993 --> 00:11:06,497
Come on, get in the car.

197
00:11:06,885 --> 00:11:10,465
Suk Jin, just get in the car.
What are you hesitating about?

198
00:11:10,819 --> 00:11:13,559
[Captain Yoo starts to feel desperate and
pushes his teammates to get in the car.]

199
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,591
Ji Hyo, get in.
Hurry up and get in.

200
00:11:14,592 --> 00:11:16,750
- This is a tough call.
- Just get in.

201
00:11:17,377 --> 00:11:18,624
Just get in.

202
00:11:22,078 --> 00:11:25,158
- Just get in, Suk Jin.
- I feel bad for him.

203
00:11:25,159 --> 00:11:26,492
Kwang Soo!

204
00:11:27,865 --> 00:11:29,653
[Huh?]

205
00:11:32,601 --> 00:11:35,149
[Monday Couple dashing over
to Captain Kkuk's team?]

206
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:36,609
You made the right decision!

207
00:11:37,107 --> 00:11:38,548
Okay, you made the right decision.

208
00:11:41,614 --> 00:11:43,732
[Darn...]

209
00:11:43,733 --> 00:11:46,219
- What the...
- Just get in the car.

210
00:11:47,055 --> 00:11:48,437
Seriously!

211
00:11:48,438 --> 00:11:50,977
Come on, Suk Jin.
Kwang Soo!

212
00:11:51,287 --> 00:11:53,725
[Everyone trying to flee from the team?]

213
00:11:53,726 --> 00:11:55,707
- Just put your seatbelt on.
- Who's your brother?

214
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:57,472
- Come on, let's not do this.
- Tell me who your brother is.

215
00:11:57,473 --> 00:11:58,775
- Suk Jin.
- Who's your beloved brother?

216
00:11:58,776 --> 00:12:00,243
- My beloved brother, Suk Jin.
- What's my name again?

217
00:12:00,244 --> 00:12:01,675
- And my beloved brother, Kwang Soo.
- Jae Suk.

218
00:12:01,676 --> 00:12:04,071
Promise me that you'll never make
another reference to my butt again.

219
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:09,354
Pil!
Chok, Chok, Cross!

220
00:12:09,355 --> 00:12:11,542
- What's 'Pil- Chok- Chok'?
- Let's just get going.

221
00:12:11,543 --> 00:12:14,337
Gary, you made the right decision.
Monday Couple is the best!

222
00:12:14,338 --> 00:12:16,142
- Yes!
- You did the right thing.

223
00:12:16,143 --> 00:12:18,646
- That was a nice move.
- Ji Hyo gave me a look.

224
00:12:19,289 --> 00:12:21,344
She gave me a look that said
she wanted to come over to this team.

225
00:12:21,345 --> 00:12:23,572
- That's a smart move.
- Good. We're all set!

226
00:12:23,573 --> 00:12:25,062
- We're set.
- Our team is all set.

227
00:12:25,063 --> 00:12:27,497
What are we going to do now?
Our team has all of a sudden become pathetic.

228
00:12:27,498 --> 00:12:32,550
When Gary was sitting back there earlier,
I felt really reassured about our team.

229
00:12:32,551 --> 00:12:34,277
And also with Kwang Soo
sitting right here too.

230
00:12:34,729 --> 00:12:37,883
You know that feeling of a cold draft blowing
through the window during winter time?

231
00:12:37,884 --> 00:12:40,288
Especially from this side.
This side over here.

232
00:12:40,289 --> 00:12:43,871
- I feel a cold draft from over here.
- Stop the car.

233
00:12:44,133 --> 00:12:47,461
- I feel like we're all heroes of some sorts.
- That's right.

234
00:12:47,496 --> 00:12:50,628
- But the other team...
- They're heroes of betrayal.

235
00:12:50,629 --> 00:12:53,917
When I was at the coffee shop earlier,
you know those vibrating discs?

236
00:12:53,918 --> 00:12:55,811
I had one of those vibrating discs
sitting on top of my chest.

237
00:12:55,812 --> 00:12:57,912
- Seriously?
- That's Iron Man.

238
00:12:58,547 --> 00:13:01,109
[Could HaHa be becoming that hero
that flies through the skies?]

239
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:02,555
- Then you're Iron Man!
- Yeah, you are.

240
00:13:02,556 --> 00:13:05,990
Remember that Iron Man hat you wore?
He's Iron Man.

241
00:13:05,991 --> 00:13:08,381
- I need turning!
- Yes, turning!

242
00:13:08,382 --> 00:13:12,127
[A movie scene parody that everyone in
Korea broke out into fits of laughter over.]

243
00:13:12,128 --> 00:13:13,215
[That Gary...]

244
00:13:13,216 --> 00:13:15,237
- I wonder who I'm going to be?
- Right?

245
00:13:15,238 --> 00:13:16,897
I'm curious about
who you're going to become too.

246
00:13:16,898 --> 00:13:18,306
What is this place?

247
00:13:18,307 --> 00:13:21,015
This really is a nice spot for a big battle.

248
00:13:21,969 --> 00:13:24,470
[The gathering location-
Arrives at Geumsanri Hills.]

249
00:13:24,767 --> 00:13:28,751
- What is that?
- Isn't that Samuel L. Jackson?

250
00:13:28,882 --> 00:13:31,887
[I'm Director Dong Fury.]

251
00:13:31,888 --> 00:13:34,757
- It's Dong Wan!
- You look so awesome, Dong Wan!

252
00:13:34,758 --> 00:13:36,458
Don't you think he looks just like him?

253
00:13:37,023 --> 00:13:39,168
What is this?
Is this war?

254
00:13:39,523 --> 00:13:41,171
- What is it?
- Is it war?

255
00:13:41,643 --> 00:13:45,015
You traitor, Song Ji Hyo!
And you, Kang Gary.

256
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:46,319
Oh my goodness!

257
00:13:46,775 --> 00:13:50,169
Oh my! That surprised me!
I thought Gil came.

258
00:13:51,171 --> 00:13:53,294
I really thought Gil came on the show.

259
00:13:53,715 --> 00:13:55,286
I had no idea that it was Dong Wan.

260
00:13:55,287 --> 00:13:57,864
<i>Soldiers, it's nice to see
you all here.</i>

261
00:13:58,007 --> 00:14:02,821
Today is the day of Running Man Avengers to
determine who the ultimate superhero is.

262
00:14:02,822 --> 00:14:04,833
- Oh yeah!
- We're the Avengers?

263
00:14:04,834 --> 00:14:06,924
[That's right!
We're the superheroes!]

264
00:14:07,645 --> 00:14:10,169
I'm your director, Director Dong Fury.

265
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:12,844
But he has hard enough time
walking around on his own two feet.

266
00:14:12,845 --> 00:14:14,559
Soldiers, I need you to stay quiet.

267
00:14:16,256 --> 00:14:18,763
- You're acting has really improved.
- That was impressive.

268
00:14:19,231 --> 00:14:20,405
Let's move on.

269
00:14:20,406 --> 00:14:24,869
Since none of you are heroes yet, you
need to earn your superhero memberships.

270
00:14:24,904 --> 00:14:26,111
So we're not heroes yet?

271
00:14:26,112 --> 00:14:29,882
In order to earn your superhero memberships,
you have to pass very rigorous training.

272
00:14:29,883 --> 00:14:31,163
Aren't you hot?

273
00:14:32,871 --> 00:14:34,344
I'm sure you're hot in that coat.

274
00:14:34,345 --> 00:14:36,165
Okay, here's your first mission.

275
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:38,359
It's paintball survival mission between

276
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,618
Captain Yoo Jae Suk and
Captain Kim Jong Kook's team.

277
00:14:40,619 --> 00:14:42,301
[Superhero membership course-
First mission: Survival challenge.]

278
00:14:42,302 --> 00:14:44,251
- This is a sure win for us.
- This is in our favor.

279
00:14:44,252 --> 00:14:46,557
But this really isn't good
with our odds.

280
00:14:46,558 --> 00:14:49,624
The team that wins this mission will
receive their membership cards right away.

281
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:55,600
And if you fail, you will continue to follow
my instructions to perform further missions.

282
00:14:56,244 --> 00:14:58,540
Okay, future heroes.
This is war.

283
00:14:58,889 --> 00:15:00,942
Your acting skills have really improved.

284
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:08,449
- Don't you think this is too unfair?
- What's unfair?

285
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:11,086
- We're short a person.
- That doesn't matter.

286
00:15:11,087 --> 00:15:12,584
If it doesn't matter,
then give us one person.

287
00:15:12,585 --> 00:15:13,736
What did you say?

288
00:15:14,594 --> 00:15:16,346
Your first mission.

289
00:15:16,347 --> 00:15:18,077
We're going to determine the
offense and defense team.

290
00:15:18,078 --> 00:15:20,789
As you can see,
there's an 'R' flag up there.

291
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:23,803
If the defense team can protect that flag,
then you succeed your mission.

292
00:15:23,956 --> 00:15:27,664
And if the offense team can steal that flag,
then you'll succeed your mission.

293
00:15:34,846 --> 00:15:39,656
[Offense Team- Captain Kkuk and members
Blank Ji, Jong Kook, HaHa, Gary.]

294
00:15:41,517 --> 00:15:44,628
[Defense Team- Captain Yoo and members
Yoo Hyuk, Big-nose, and Giraffe.]

295
00:15:45,404 --> 00:15:48,849
[Rule: If the name tag on their back is hit by
the opposing team's paint, they're out!]

296

[Survival Game- Start.]

297

[Captain Kkuk and his team approaching
the flag without any hesitation.]

298
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:02,483
- Still too far away.
- I see Jae Suk coming down there.

299
00:16:03,898 --> 00:16:06,284
Left, left. Go to the left.
Approach from their behind.

300
00:16:06,285 --> 00:16:08,947
- Where?
- To the left. Someone go over to the left.

301
00:16:10,142 --> 00:16:12,128
- Where?
- To the right over that way.

302
00:16:14,183 --> 00:16:16,023
- Are you keeping a close eye, Kwang Soo?
- Yes, Jae Suk.

303
00:16:16,024 --> 00:16:18,612
- Dong Hoon is on his way.
- Where? Which way is he coming from?

304
00:16:18,665 --> 00:16:20,639
[There he is!]

305
00:16:20,999 --> 00:16:23,035
[An opening?
Why is he standing up?]

306
00:16:29,049 --> 00:16:31,416
[The paintball hits the mark!]

307
00:16:33,208 --> 00:16:35,053
- That scaredy cat!
- He hit me!

308
00:16:35,503 --> 00:16:38,153
- Are you hit?
- No, he hit the can.

309
00:16:38,154 --> 00:16:40,054
I'll shoot towards Kwang Soo!

310
00:16:40,055 --> 00:16:42,808
- Gary, I'll shoot towards Kwang Soo!
- No! Don't shoot!

311
00:16:42,809 --> 00:16:44,064
I'll throw down my weapon!

312
00:16:45,191 --> 00:16:47,326
[Blank Ji's undercover fire!]

313
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:50,126
[Just then]

314
00:16:51,066 --> 00:16:52,793
[Gary being too careless.]

315
00:16:58,336 --> 00:16:59,440
What's wrong?

316
00:17:01,496 --> 00:17:03,533
[Wow!
Right on target!]

317
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,034
Are you hit?

318
00:17:06,466 --> 00:17:07,583
Where?

319
00:17:07,584 --> 00:17:09,012
Where did you get hit?

320
00:17:09,013 --> 00:17:10,398
- I shot him.
- Let's see.

321
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:13,008
- Where did Gary get hit?
- Gary's out?

322
00:17:13,354 --> 00:17:14,540
- Where did he get hit?
- Jae Suk, I shot him!

323
00:17:14,541 --> 00:17:15,977
- How did that happen?
- Great job.

324
00:17:15,978 --> 00:17:17,684
[Wow... what got into Kwang Soo?]

325
00:17:17,685 --> 00:17:20,317
- We can't lose Gary!
- Good. Now, it's three against three!

326
00:17:20,317 --> 00:17:21,610
Move forward!

327
00:17:22,482 --> 00:17:25,032
[Giraffe shouting out a battle cry to
move forward out of his excitement.]

328

Stop hiding like a coward!

341
00:17:58,613 --> 00:18:00,506
Make sure that they don't
sneak up here!

342

[Kkuk having moved
pretty close towards the flag.]

343

the showering of the paintball shots.]

350

showering them with fire.]

- Does it hurt?
- No, it doesn't hurt.

- Hey, watch out on your left.
- Suk Jin!

381
00:19:52,204 --> 00:19:54,027

- What are you watching, Kwang Soo?
- I'm watching you right now, Jae Suk.

386
00:20:04,313 --> 00:20:07,164

to the point of explosion.]

even higher up the hill!]

lock in on you, Jong Kook.

happening in here?]

If you pass through the three courses of
training, everyone will receive a membership.

473

However, if you can clear the mission
before those three courses

474
00:25:07,475 --> 00:25:10,393
we will stop the training, and
give out the membership immediately.

How can you tell us to play Killer Dodge ball
after what you've just shown us?

481
00:25:24,678 --> 00:25:28,454
- We're not playing against them, are we?
- I think you're playing against those guys.

482

Are you okay?

498
00:26:14,729 --> 00:26:16,377
[Gary having difficulty breathing.]

499
00:26:16,378 --> 00:26:19,142
- Think about your mom.
- Did you hear that thud?

500
00:26:22,555 --> 00:26:24,000
Okay, let's do this!

501
00:26:25,576 --> 00:26:26,840
It's Jong Kook!

502
00:26:30,909 --> 00:26:33,726
[The lightning speed
making them feel on edge.]

503
00:26:33,727 --> 00:26:35,978
Make sure that you're careful,
and watch out for the ball.

504
00:26:35,979 --> 00:26:37,793
This is terrifying!

505
00:26:38,709 --> 00:26:41,440
[All hell's breaking loose!]

506
00:26:42,361 --> 00:26:44,548
- Those guys are angry!
- They can't be doing this!

507
00:26:44,549 --> 00:26:47,131
- A minute.
- We've only got a minute left. It's okay.

508
00:26:47,132 --> 00:26:49,044
Jong Kook's not good at everything.

509
00:26:55,090 --> 00:26:56,324
I'm sorry.

510
00:26:56,325 --> 00:26:57,879
Wow, this is tough.

511
00:26:59,022 --> 00:27:00,434
They might be able to pull this off.

512
00:27:01,032 --> 00:27:03,019
Why are you going easy on Ji Hyo?

513
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:05,048
Look at how easy they're throwing
the ball at Ji Hyo.

514
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:07,446
- Who gets it?
- Not that side.

515
00:27:07,447 --> 00:27:09,182
[Blank Ji with the ball.]

516
00:27:10,216 --> 00:27:12,765
[A fight for the ball?]

517
00:27:12,766 --> 00:27:15,552
- Hurry up and give it to someone.
- You have to tell us who you're giving it to.

518
00:27:18,249 --> 00:27:20,081
You're giving the ball
to the good looking guy?

519
00:27:23,689 --> 00:27:24,771
No, it didn't hit him.

520
00:27:24,772 --> 00:27:26,998
[Captain Kkuk doing a good job
of avoiding the ball.]

521
00:27:26,999 --> 00:27:29,494
[However...]

522
00:27:31,005 --> 00:27:32,537
[It's a bulls eye on Ro-Ro!]

523
00:27:33,309 --> 00:27:35,699
[Then Captain Kkuk immediately following!]

524
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:37,267
It's a double hitter!

525
00:27:37,741 --> 00:27:39,127
Wait, wait!

526
00:27:39,128 --> 00:27:40,714
[Blank Ji is the only one left!]

527
00:27:40,715 --> 00:27:42,683
Why don't you try to act cute
for them?

528
00:27:42,684 --> 00:27:44,527
[Action stars' toughness having
gone soft.]

529
00:27:48,815 --> 00:27:51,267
[Blank Ji- Out!]

530
00:27:52,109 --> 00:27:54,879
[Captain Kkuk's Team-
Fails the first mission!]

531
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:58,008
- You're going to have to do the next mission.
- Our Gary is level eight in martial arts!

532
00:27:58,644 --> 00:28:01,790
- You know what a flying kick is?
- Forget it. I'm hurting right now.

533
00:28:04,546 --> 00:28:07,245
[A demonstration by membership
carrying Captain Yoo's team?]

534
00:28:07,246 --> 00:28:08,989
Do we have to show you how it's done?

535
00:28:08,990 --> 00:28:12,163
- Seriously.
- What were you guys even doing out there?

536
00:28:12,164 --> 00:28:14,564
- How frustrating.
- We need to show them how it's done.

537
00:28:14,565 --> 00:28:16,814
- Why can't you get it done?
- Can we loosen up a little?

538
00:28:16,815 --> 00:28:18,972
- Seriously.
- Let's show them.

539
00:28:21,093 --> 00:28:22,916
I can't believe you couldn't
last those two minutes.

540
00:28:22,917 --> 00:28:24,581
Let's show them what
real heroes are capable of.

541
00:28:24,582 --> 00:28:26,091
Let's show them what we're capable of.

542
00:28:26,092 --> 00:28:28,728
Don't go easy on us.
Let's do this right.

543
00:28:28,729 --> 00:28:30,316
Where's the ball?

544
00:28:30,317 --> 00:28:32,301
- Watch yourself, Kwang Soo.
- You've got one minute.

545
00:28:33,955 --> 00:28:36,058
Wait... what are you doing to me?

546
00:28:36,565 --> 00:28:38,891
[What are you all doing
standing in a line?]

547
00:28:38,892 --> 00:28:39,995
What are you guys doing?

548
00:28:42,091 --> 00:28:43,143
Wait.

549
00:28:43,144 --> 00:28:45,605
[To be called a superhero when
you're acting like that...]

550
00:28:48,772 --> 00:28:49,931
[Kwang Soo in danger!]

551
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:53,601
[Oh, nice escape!]

552
00:28:57,779 --> 00:29:00,960
[Nice catch of the ball flying
at lightning speed!

553
00:29:05,432 --> 00:29:08,689
[Could he have gone through a transformation
now that he's got his superhero membership?]

554
00:29:09,975 --> 00:29:11,593
Let's run around.
Let's run around in a circle.

555
00:29:13,733 --> 00:29:16,927
[That's more like it.]

556
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:18,873
[Knows to oust himself.]

557
00:29:21,727 --> 00:29:24,290
[And just at the same time.]

558
00:29:26,557 --> 00:29:28,974
[Another person arriving at
the airport.]

559
00:29:29,227 --> 00:29:30,879
Jong Kook... you just wait.

560
00:29:34,215 --> 00:29:38,533
Okay, your second mission is...
Loyal Sit-ups.

561
00:29:38,534 --> 00:29:41,688
While an action star does
the sit-ups for a minute

562
00:29:41,689 --> 00:29:43,706
your team will do the sit-ups
in a relay.

563
00:29:43,707 --> 00:29:45,960
Action star, please make your entrance.

564
00:29:47,209 --> 00:29:49,962
[Always making their entrance
with spirited shouts.]

565
00:29:50,358 --> 00:29:52,528
I bet they'll do like 80 sit-ups
in a minute.

566
00:29:52,529 --> 00:29:54,567
They look like they'd be swift.

567
00:29:56,049 --> 00:29:57,530
[Starting the full minute of sit-ups.]

568
00:29:57,531 --> 00:30:00,525
- Two, three, four, five, six...
- How can they do it so fast?

569
00:30:00,526 --> 00:30:03,100
- His back isn't touching the ground.
- The back doesn't have to touch.

570
00:30:03,101 --> 00:30:06,918
- Make him touch his knees with his elbows.
- 11, 12, 13, 14...

571
00:30:07,824 --> 00:30:10,175
[Not showing any signs
of slowing down.]

572
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:16,856
- 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26...
- He's like a machine.

573
00:30:16,857 --> 00:30:18,951
[Performing more like a machine.]

574
00:30:20,644 --> 00:30:22,718
[Breaking through 64...]

575
00:30:23,126 --> 00:30:25,115
I can see the whites of his eyes.

576
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,269
[The minute is ticking down to an end...]

577
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:30,752
One more, do one more!

578
00:30:33,011 --> 00:30:34,617
[70!]

579
00:30:34,618 --> 00:30:36,077
Is the time up?

580
00:30:36,938 --> 00:30:39,654
[Wow!
71 sit-ups in a minute!]

581
00:30:39,655 --> 00:30:42,587
- That's amazing!
- 71 sit-ups within a minute in a relay.

582
00:30:42,588 --> 00:30:45,040
[Team Kkuk's team must perform
71 sit-ups in a minute in a relay.]

583
00:30:45,824 --> 00:30:47,755
- Wow, this is...
- I'm ready.

584
00:30:53,333 --> 00:30:56,370
- One, two, three, four...
- He's fast.

585
00:30:56,371 --> 00:30:58,671
[Wow!
He's fast!]

586
00:30:58,672 --> 00:31:01,013
- Seven, eight, nine...
- He's pretty fast.

587
00:31:01,397 --> 00:31:03,581
[Amazing speed!
A fighting master, Gary!]

588
00:31:03,582 --> 00:31:11,156
13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20...

589
00:31:11,665 --> 00:31:12,733
He's not slowing down yet.

590
00:31:12,734 --> 00:31:15,982
- Are you okay?
- Okay, we can do this.

591
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:19,245
[29 for Gary!]

592
00:31:20,709 --> 00:31:23,497
30, 31, 32, 33...

593
00:31:23,773 --> 00:31:25,967
[Blank Ji attempting the challenge
with her teeth tightly clenched!]

594
00:31:25,968 --> 00:31:29,292
- 35, 36, 37...
- Come on, you can do this!

595
00:31:29,293 --> 00:31:32,197
- 38, 39, 40!
- Stop!

596
00:31:32,198 --> 00:31:34,573
[Broke through 40!
Now down to HaHa!]

597
00:31:34,574 --> 00:31:39,020
- 43, 44, 45, 16, 47, 48...
- Hold on tight.

598
00:31:39,021 --> 00:31:41,341
49, 50, 51...

599
00:31:41,342 --> 00:31:43,543
[Now only need 20 more!]

600
00:31:45,652 --> 00:31:47,688
[Last turn- Mr. Capable!]

601
00:31:47,689 --> 00:31:49,893
[Powerful sit-ups!]

602
00:31:49,894 --> 00:31:58,062
59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64... 69...

603
00:31:59,945 --> 00:32:01,093
69...

604
00:32:01,094 --> 00:32:03,558
[Wow... that was so close!]

605
00:32:04,205 --> 00:32:06,129
Wow... just two short!

606
00:32:06,130 --> 00:32:07,717
Wow, they just needed two more.

607
00:32:07,718 --> 00:32:09,570
Wow, that was so close!

608
00:32:09,571 --> 00:32:13,551
- How about Jae Suk?
- Let's see the hero team's demonstration.

609
00:32:13,814 --> 00:32:16,056
- Come on, we don't need to do that.
- Show us how it's done.

610
00:32:16,057 --> 00:32:18,204
Let's show them why we're the heroes.

611
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,625
- No, we can show them.
- Okay, let's show them.

612
00:32:21,626 --> 00:32:25,617
- Okay, then I'll go first.
- Let's show them! Let's do this!

613
00:32:25,652 --> 00:32:28,181
- Let's show them what we're capable of!
- We're heroes!

614
00:32:28,182 --> 00:32:30,633
Watch and see how sit-ups are done.

615
00:32:30,634 --> 00:32:32,196
- Ready?
- Let's go.

616
00:32:33,122 --> 00:32:34,907
Ugh, you're so ugly.
You startled me with your ugliness.

617
00:32:35,789 --> 00:32:37,860
[Startled after seeing his face?]

618
00:32:39,959 --> 00:32:41,579
You have to touch your knees
with your elbows.

619
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:43,260
How can you be so ugly?

620
00:32:44,164 --> 00:32:46,709
Ugh, you scare me.
I can't believe you look like that.

621
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:49,522
[It already seems as though breaking
the record is going to be an impossibility.]

622
00:32:49,523 --> 00:32:51,441
You can't stop now.

623
00:32:51,442 --> 00:32:54,017
- Next.
- He's even uglier.

624
00:32:54,018 --> 00:32:56,710
- This one is even uglier.
- You guys can't do this.

625
00:32:56,711 --> 00:32:58,883
He really is like a giraffe
with that neck of his!

626
00:32:58,884 --> 00:33:01,953
This really is the ugly team.

627
00:33:01,954 --> 00:33:04,492
Wow, he really is ugly.

628
00:33:04,493 --> 00:33:06,309
- Pass it over to the next person.
- Next.

629
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:09,423
- Kwang Soo, you did good.
- It's like watching the slow video.

630
00:33:09,424 --> 00:33:10,861
What are you doing, Suk Jin?

631
00:33:10,862 --> 00:33:12,149
Suk Jin!

632
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:15,057
You have to come up further.

633
00:33:17,369 --> 00:33:20,223
[A fascinating method- Smacking
the back of the head to get moving.]

634
00:33:22,123 --> 00:33:24,947
[Show us why you're the superheroes?]

635
00:33:24,948 --> 00:33:26,730
You want us to hit it for you?

636
00:33:27,544 --> 00:33:29,478
[Fail]

637
00:33:29,479 --> 00:33:31,401
- Are you kidding?
- What was that?

638
00:33:31,402 --> 00:33:33,164
What are you guys doing?

639
00:33:33,165 --> 00:33:34,754
I don't know what happened.
We can easily handle that.

640
00:33:34,755 --> 00:33:36,858
- Really.
- That really was too bad.

641
00:33:36,859 --> 00:33:38,907
- Let's do this.
- Let's get it done this time.

642
00:33:38,908 --> 00:33:40,735
Just do one and pass it over
to the next person, okay, Ji Hyo?

643
00:33:40,736 --> 00:33:42,263
[Last chance!
Ji Hyo only to do one and pass it on?]

644
00:33:43,331 --> 00:33:44,651
- Okay.
- We're ready.

645
00:33:44,652 --> 00:33:47,181
[If they fail again this round,
it's off to course three of training hell.]

646
00:33:47,881 --> 00:33:48,905
One!

647
00:33:48,906 --> 00:33:52,270
[Ji Hyo only does one and immediately
passes over to Captain Kkuk.]

648
00:33:52,271 --> 00:33:53,936
5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11...

649
00:33:53,937 --> 00:33:56,424
- Wow, he's something else.
- He really is a machine too.

650
00:33:56,425 --> 00:34:03,518
13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18... 22...

651
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:05,926
[Doing the sit-ups with
every fiber of his being.]

652
00:34:05,927 --> 00:34:09,662
26, 17, 28, 19, 30!

653
00:34:09,663 --> 00:34:11,646
[Already 30 sit-ups in the bag!]

654
00:34:11,647 --> 00:34:19,849
32, 33, 34, 35... 43...

655
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:23,477
[A serious side of Ro-Ro
that we're not used to seeing.]

656
00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:25,374
46, 47, 48, 49, 50!

657
00:34:25,375 --> 00:34:27,630
[50 already finished!]

658
00:34:28,796 --> 00:34:31,114
[Last person to take his turn is Gary!]

659
00:34:31,115 --> 00:34:33,309
- You can do it.
- You can do this, Gary.

660
00:34:33,310 --> 00:34:34,987

Me?
Slap you?

837
00:45:47,077 --> 00:45:49,290
Suk Jin, I love you.

838

This is so frustrating.

839
00:45:53,075 --> 00:45:54,717
Does being frustrated work?

840
00:45:54,718 --> 00:45:56,111

Spider Gary's power away from him!]

but misses his shot.]

with your arrow.

852

- Did you just avoid it?
- No.

853
00:46:46,462 --> 00:46:47,775
But I definitely shot it in
your direction.

854
00:46:47,776 --> 00:46:50,782
Why would you suddenly
try shooting me with that thing?

855
00:46:50,783 --> 00:46:54,420
[Unfortunate Giraffe still unable to do
anything even after becoming a superhero.]

856

Seriously.
Are you going to keep doing that?

857
00:46:56,269 --> 00:47:00,076
You can't try to shoot your spider webs
pathetically like you did the last time, okay?

858
00:47:00,077 --> 00:47:02,527
I'm the Spiderman.

859
00:47:02,528 --> 00:47:04,965
- I'm the Spiderman today.
- Yes, you are.

860

[Sound of music suddenly
ringing throughout the mall.]

- Do you hear that music?
- What is that?

00:47:14,231 --> 00:47:15,927
Is the Hulk making his transformation?

864

eliminated, both of you will be eliminated!</i>

eliminated, then they are both eliminated.]

[Unexpected turn of events.

- No way!
- Is this what I think it is?

883

This is the music they play when
Athlete Chu Sung Hoon makes his entrance.

884
00:48:33,419 --> 00:48:36,970
[The unforgettable melody...]

885

Jae Suk.

897

[Even more anxious than
they were a minute ago.]

898
00:49:36,584 --> 00:49:39,790
- We're going to be demolished.
- I know. We should gather our powers.

899

put in danger by our enemies.

900

How are we supposed to anger you?
Like this?

901
00:49:44,773 --> 00:49:47,048
- That's not enough to get me angry.
- What's important here is...

902
00:49:47,329 --> 00:49:49,597
Shouldn't we tell each other what
our own special powers are?

903
00:49:49,598 --> 00:49:52,547
[Too strong of enemies for
Running Man Avengers Team to face!]

904

I really don't have any powers.

994
00:54:44,761 --> 00:54:48,135
[Wow... Dr. Zhee's courageous moves?]

995
00:54:48,136 --> 00:54:49,593
You're going to get hit
if you keep provoking him.

996
00:54:50,367 --> 00:54:53,845
[Dr. Zhee trying to provoke him
into angering him.]

997
00:54:55,131 --> 00:54:57,907
- Hey. You need to be more careful.
- Why? What did I do?

998
00:54:57,908 --> 00:54:59,677
I'm getting so angry all of a sudden!

999
00:54:59,678 --> 00:55:02,283
- You can't anger him, Jong Kook.
- Yes, I'm aware of that.

1000
00:55:02,568 --> 00:55:04,630
- You know?
- You know what all our powers are?

1001
00:55:04,631 --> 00:55:06,403
I have my own theory about it.

1002
00:55:06,404 --> 00:55:08,589
- I guessed his powers.
- What is Jong Kook's power?

1003
00:55:09,071 --> 00:55:10,805
My power really isn't anything.

1004
00:55:10,806 --> 00:55:13,982
My name tag got bigger after
you hit it with your hammer.

1005
00:55:13,983 --> 00:55:16,301
No, it wasn't me.
Someone else did that to you.

1006
00:55:17,126 --> 00:55:21,478
[Men in black coming onto scene
with something held in their hands.]

1007
00:55:21,479 --> 00:55:23,172
- Let's get out of here.
- Let's move.

1008
00:55:24,009 --> 00:55:26,818
[Running Man Avengers
flee the scene for now!]

1009
00:55:26,819 --> 00:55:30,881
[Master Jung walks around in ease
with the knowledge of what's going on.]

1010
00:55:32,551 --> 00:55:36,354
The given motto of Running Man members
is to betray.

1011
00:55:36,624 --> 00:55:38,488
They have no sides or loyalty.

1012
00:55:38,489 --> 00:55:41,117
[Their conclusion is that Avengers will not
remain loyal to one another.]

1013
00:55:46,091 --> 00:55:48,146
[Discovers Spider Gary!]

1014
00:55:48,147 --> 00:55:50,684
[Starting the chase!]

1015
00:55:52,657 --> 00:55:55,334
[Is it time to show them my
web powers?]

1016
00:55:55,335 --> 00:55:57,161
What are you doing?
Don't come any closer!

1017
00:55:57,162 --> 00:55:58,405
What are you doing?

1018
00:56:01,183 --> 00:56:03,633
[Spider Gary fires his superpower web!]

1019
00:56:03,634 --> 00:56:05,787
[Taecyeon avoids it!]

1020
00:56:07,953 --> 00:56:09,446
[Flustered]

1021
00:56:13,078 --> 00:56:15,631
- Spiderman is in danger!
- Let's go help him!

1022
00:56:21,877 --> 00:56:24,679
[Spider Gary in danger!]

1023
00:56:25,079 --> 00:56:26,599
Hey!
Hey, wait!

1024
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:27,969
Hey!

1025
00:56:30,165 --> 00:56:32,569
[Spider Gary's name tag has
been eliminated!]

1026
00:56:32,570 --> 00:56:34,271
- Hello.
- Yeah, hi.

1027
00:56:34,272 --> 00:56:36,621
- You know who's here, right?
- Yes, we know.

1028
00:56:36,622 --> 00:56:38,541
- Chu Sung Hoon is here.
- We're waiting to see him too.

1029
00:56:38,542 --> 00:56:41,284
[Is Gary Running Man Avengers'
first victim?]

1030
00:56:41,285 --> 00:56:44,371
- What were you doing with that?
- This is my superpower.

1031
00:56:44,493 --> 00:56:46,049
- You're Spiderman?
- Yeah.

1032
00:56:47,096 --> 00:56:49,863
Okay, good luck to you guys.

1033
00:56:49,864 --> 00:56:52,702
[Wishing 2PM luck on their mission,
and sends them away.]

1034
00:56:54,766 --> 00:56:56,807
Those guys...

1035
00:56:57,292 --> 00:56:59,214
[I'm Spider Gary!]

1036
00:56:59,215 --> 00:57:02,072
[You can't kill me that easily.]

1037
00:57:02,808 --> 00:57:04,732
Those two guys got me.

1038
00:57:06,748 --> 00:57:08,581
[Huh?]

1039
00:57:12,393 --> 00:57:14,977
[His name tag is attached to
a spider web?]

1040
00:57:16,714 --> 00:57:19,031
No one knew my little secret.

1041
00:57:21,869 --> 00:57:26,449
[Spider Gary's name tag is attached
to a spider web!]

1042
00:57:26,450 --> 00:57:31,536
[As long as that string doesn't get severed,
the name tag can be re-attached!]

1043
00:57:31,537 --> 00:57:33,096
A secret that no one was aware of.

1044
00:57:33,097 --> 00:57:35,618
[Spider Gary is brought back to life!]

1045
00:57:37,863 --> 00:57:39,407
Hello!

1046
00:57:39,408 --> 00:57:41,453
Don't come any closer,
or I'll shoot you.

1047
00:57:42,629 --> 00:57:44,434
I really will shoot you.

1048
00:57:44,435 --> 00:57:45,901
Don't come any closer.

1049
00:57:46,868 --> 00:57:48,882
Fine, want a go?

1050
00:57:48,883 --> 00:57:50,066
What should we do?

1051
00:57:58,286 --> 00:58:01,855
[One of Iron Ha's superpowers-
Flying through the air!]

1052
00:58:03,214 --> 00:58:05,632
- What is he doing?
- Wow!

1053
00:58:05,633 --> 00:58:09,617
[Moving effortlessly through the sky.]

1054
00:58:11,451 --> 00:58:14,711
[This is the power of Iron Ha's
superpowers through his gadgets.]

1055
00:58:15,427 --> 00:58:17,684
[I'm envious of HaHa's powers.]

1056
00:58:25,865 --> 00:58:28,321
Gary!
Why are you still here?

1057
00:58:28,621 --> 00:58:29,827
Gary!

1058
00:58:29,828 --> 00:58:31,815
- Why are you running from us?
- Me?

1059
00:58:32,267 --> 00:58:34,497
Because I'm scared.
Sung Hoon's right over there.

1060
00:58:35,451 --> 00:58:36,814
Why are you scared?

1061
00:58:36,815 --> 00:58:38,722
But we eliminated your...
oh, it's back on there.

1062
00:58:40,342 --> 00:58:43,145
- His name tag is still there.
- Why? Didn't we rip it off?

1063
00:58:43,718 --> 00:58:45,131
Behind you!

1064
00:58:46,967 --> 00:58:49,754
- We really are easy to fool.
- We're too easy to fool.

1065
00:58:50,650 --> 00:58:52,601
We really are too easy to fool, aren't we?

1066
00:58:53,443 --> 00:58:55,573
[Making his escape before
he's chased after again.]

1067
00:58:57,293 --> 00:59:00,349
[Just then, The Fighter starts
to chase after Spider Gary!]

1068
00:59:01,929 --> 00:59:03,303
Help me!

1069
00:59:05,055 --> 00:59:06,823
- Gary!
- Yes?

1070
00:59:07,003 --> 00:59:09,181
Let's go for a round!

1071
00:59:09,182 --> 00:59:11,139
Let's go for a round!

1072
00:59:11,827 --> 00:59:13,338
Let's go for a round!

1073
00:59:13,339 --> 00:59:17,846
[The Fighter's superpower is activated!]

1074
00:59:17,847 --> 00:59:20,581
Sung Hoon!
You can't do this!

1075
00:59:20,992 --> 00:59:24,032
- Fight! Fight!
- Why do you want to see a fight?

1076
00:59:25,650 --> 00:59:29,858
[Spider Gary locked up in the ring
for the next minute with The Fighter.]

1077
00:59:29,859 --> 00:59:31,944
This is what they were carrying.

1078
00:59:31,945 --> 00:59:33,849
- What is that?
- It's a real ring.

1079
00:59:34,278 --> 00:59:36,684
Don't forget that I'm Spiderman.

1080
00:59:39,191 --> 00:59:42,594
[Acting as though something
super powerful is hidden in the bag.]

1081
00:59:42,595 --> 00:59:45,735
I... I have my superpowers.

1082
00:59:45,736 --> 00:59:50,085
- What? What do you have in the bag?
- It's something. I have my own tricks.

1083
00:59:51,478 --> 00:59:54,011
- And what is that?
- What do you think it is?

1084
00:59:54,012 --> 00:59:55,724
[The Fighter hesitating with his attack.]

1085
00:59:55,725 --> 00:59:57,719
Ugh, this is so annoying!

1086
01:00:00,144 --> 01:00:02,624
What is it?
What do you have in there?

1087
01:00:02,625 --> 01:00:04,952
Don't make me do it!
Don't make me take it out of the bag!

1088
01:00:09,718 --> 01:00:12,048
- You got ten seconds left.
- Ten seconds?

1089
01:00:12,049 --> 01:00:15,195
[The Fighter's minute
in the ring is almost up!]

1090
01:00:15,196 --> 01:00:17,288
Don't come near me!
You really will get yourself into trouble!

1091
01:00:19,248 --> 01:00:22,545
[Time's up!]

1092
01:00:22,546 --> 01:00:25,413
Sung Hoon!
I'm out of here!

1093
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:29,413
[Spider Gary bluffs his way
out of danger.]

1094
01:00:33,158 --> 01:00:36,257
Who are those people going around in pairs?
Those guys dressed in suits?

1095
01:00:36,258 --> 01:00:39,224
That's Chu Sung Hoon's powers.

1096
01:00:39,225 --> 01:00:42,256
- His ring...
- What? I have no powers!

1097
01:00:43,178 --> 01:00:45,385
Why are you trying to hide it
when we've already seen it?

1098
01:00:45,386 --> 01:00:47,757
- He has a ring?
- You don't want him to catch up to you.

1099
01:00:48,667 --> 01:00:50,563
- Sung Hoon.
- Yes?

1100
01:00:50,979 --> 01:00:54,093
You have to move faster and
eliminate Gary and Jong Kook.

1101
01:00:54,094 --> 01:00:56,338
- Where's Jong Kook?
- What?

1102
01:00:56,339 --> 01:00:57,897
I haven't seen Jong Kook at all.

1103
01:00:57,898 --> 01:01:00,767
Jong Kook's going around saying that
he's going to destroy you this time.

1104
01:01:02,223 --> 01:01:04,395
- Jong Kook is going around saying...
- Where is he?

1105
01:01:04,396 --> 01:01:08,595
He says that he gave you a break ever since
he won that wrestling match against you.

1106
01:01:08,596 --> 01:01:10,310
Seriously?

1107
01:01:11,611 --> 01:01:13,387
Jong Kook!

1108
01:01:13,388 --> 01:01:15,310
Yeah, go get Jong Kook!

1109
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:19,294
[Gentle Fighter really getting fired up
after hearing their comments.]

1110
01:01:21,127 --> 01:01:23,367
[Right then, Kkuk Thor is...]

1111
01:01:24,379 --> 01:01:28,170
I can't believe my name tag got enlarged
like this as soon as the game started.

1112
01:01:28,171 --> 01:01:29,564
I can't even do anything now.

1113
01:01:35,423 --> 01:01:40,683
[Dr. Zhee on the other hand is trying to raise
his heartbeat to make his transformation.]

1114
01:01:42,420 --> 01:01:46,492
[Able to make his transformation once
his heart rate reaches 170!]

1115
01:01:47,577 --> 01:01:49,719
- This is my chance.
- What are you doing?

1116
01:01:49,720 --> 01:01:51,710
Kwang Soo.
Kwang Soo!

1117
01:01:51,711 --> 01:01:54,904
- Kick me in the behind. Hurry.
- Want me to shoot you with my arrow?

1118
01:01:55,250 --> 01:01:57,293
No, just kick me with your foot.
Seriously.

1119
01:01:58,038 --> 01:01:59,103
Hey, hey.

1120
01:02:01,652 --> 01:02:04,614
[Giraffe Eye shoots Dr. Zhee
with his arrow of misfortune!]

1121
01:02:04,615 --> 01:02:05,856
Is it making you angry?

1122
01:02:05,857 --> 01:02:07,558
Why?
Are you getting angry?

1123
01:02:07,559 --> 01:02:09,640
Yeah, I'm angry.
I'm still not there?

1124
01:02:10,076 --> 01:02:11,845
What?
What is it?

1125
01:02:11,846 --> 01:02:13,190
What is it?

1126
01:02:13,191 --> 01:02:16,507
What? What is it?
What's happening to me, Kwang Soo?

1127
01:02:16,508 --> 01:02:19,229
[Being taken somewhere after being
hit by Giraffe Eye's arrow of misfortune.]

1128
01:02:19,230 --> 01:02:21,060
- What have you done to me?
- What?

1129
01:02:24,168 --> 01:02:27,084
I'm so angry.
Seriously.

1130
01:02:28,197 --> 01:02:29,834
I was so close!

1131
01:02:29,835 --> 01:02:32,483
I seriously barely managed to get it up.

1132
01:02:32,484 --> 01:02:34,698
I was so close to hitting it.

1133
01:02:34,699 --> 01:02:40,280
[Misfortune: To lower his heart rate, he must
stay in the meditation room for 10 minutes.]

1134
01:02:42,102 --> 01:02:47,522
[The effects of the meditation room-
Heart rate is dropping at a steady decline.]

1135
01:02:52,189 --> 01:02:55,695
[Working hard again to bring
his heartbeat up to 170.]

1136
01:02:56,401 --> 01:02:59,973
[What kind of transformation will
take place after all his efforts?]

1137
01:03:00,363 --> 01:03:02,808
[Exercising like he has never done before!]

1138
01:03:05,540 --> 01:03:08,287
Let's make the transformation.
Please, just this once!

1139
01:03:08,288 --> 01:03:10,070
Please.
Please!

1140
01:03:10,071 --> 01:03:13,079
<i>If your heart rate climbs over 170...</i>

1141
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:18,084
[If his heart rate climbs over 170...]

1142
01:03:18,085 --> 01:03:20,278
<i>A truly frightening power
will be activated.</i>

1143
01:03:20,279 --> 01:03:22,226
[His truly frightening power
will come to life!]

1144
01:03:23,167 --> 01:03:25,759
[The nature of the beast that has been
hidden deep inside of Dr. Zhee!]

1145
01:03:30,054 --> 01:03:34,722
[Awaken the power!]

1146
01:03:44,348 --> 01:03:46,004

into a wild beast!]

[The ultimate fighting champion
representing Korea!]

[Kim Dong Hyun!]

1151
01:04:09,065 --> 01:04:12,531
[Dr. Zhee's superpower-
He is the Hulk!]

1152
01:04:16,279 --> 01:04:19,852
[He is on the move!]

1153
01:04:21,753 --> 01:04:23,609
It's Kim Dong Hyun!

1154
01:04:27,127 --> 01:04:29,289
- What? What is it?
- It's The Hulk!

1155
01:04:29,290 --> 01:04:30,907
- It's The Hulk!
- Run!

01:04:30,908 --> 01:04:32,323
- It's The Hulk!
- Who is that?

1157
01:04:32,324 --> 01:04:34,030
He keeps coming after us!

1158
01:04:34,031 --> 01:04:36,141
Please stop following us!

1159
01:04:37,653 --> 01:04:39,168
What the heck?

1160
01:04:39,169 --> 01:04:40,655
Hey, Dong Hyun!

1161
01:04:41,092 --> 01:04:45,061
- What are you doing?
- Come here, Sung Hoon!

1162
01:04:45,062 --> 01:04:46,187
What did you say?

1163
01:04:46,188 --> 01:04:48,675
[The Fighter flees the scene!]

1164
01:04:52,004 --> 01:04:53,719
Why are you here?

1165
01:04:57,219 --> 01:04:59,623
I guess I should be quieter.
Everyone is running away from me.

1166
01:05:07,221 --> 01:05:09,465
[Discovers his target!]

1167
01:05:09,689 --> 01:05:11,672
[Spider Gary!]

1168
01:05:15,965 --> 01:05:17,647
Wait!
Wait!

1169
01:05:17,648 --> 01:05:20,223
[Monster vs. Human Spider.]

1170
01:05:20,992 --> 01:05:22,632
I don't know how to speak Korean.

1171
01:05:24,329 --> 01:05:26,610
Wait a minute.
Do you even know what I have in here?

1172
01:05:26,986 --> 01:05:28,866
No, I don't know.

1173
01:05:33,940 --> 01:05:36,625
- Wait! Don't you know what's in here?
- What? What is it?

1174
01:05:36,626 --> 01:05:38,520
[Spider Gary trying to
bluff his way out again!]

1175
01:05:38,521 --> 01:05:40,198
You can end up regretting this.

1176
01:05:42,642 --> 01:05:44,936
Why don't we shake hands first?
It's been a while.

1177
01:05:44,937 --> 01:05:47,038
- Yes.
- Let's shake with our right hand.

1178
01:05:47,039 --> 01:05:49,128
I'll put my fist down first.

1179
01:05:49,129 --> 01:05:50,579
Wait!

1180
01:05:51,542 --> 01:05:53,696
Wait!
You're squeezing my hand!

1181
01:05:53,697 --> 01:05:56,018
Dong Hyun!
Wait!

1182
01:05:57,132 --> 01:06:00,080
[Spider Gary trying to use
his web once again?]

1183
01:06:04,180 --> 01:06:05,534
[Starts his spider web attack!]

1184
01:06:05,535 --> 01:06:07,801
- What is it?
- Stop coming after me!

1185
01:06:08,021 --> 01:06:10,998
[But his spider web is
extremely tangled in his bag.]

1186
01:06:17,254 --> 01:06:19,636
[Immediate chaos!]

1187
01:06:22,846 --> 01:06:24,816
[The Hulk starts his attack on Gary!]

1188
01:06:26,772 --> 01:06:28,250
What are you guys doing?

1189
01:06:34,056 --> 01:06:37,121
[But his spider web is still fortunately
stuck to the name tag!]

1190
01:06:41,949 --> 01:06:44,006
[What?
It's been severed!]

1191
01:06:49,209 --> 01:06:51,932
[Spider Gary- Out!]

1192
01:06:51,933 --> 01:06:53,512
I'm really out?

1193
01:06:55,493 --> 01:06:57,416
He severed my web?

1194
01:06:58,244 --> 01:07:00,450
He really severed my web?

1195
01:07:00,451 --> 01:07:02,048
[Can't believe it's been severed.]

1196
01:07:02,049 --> 01:07:03,936
What the heck is this?

1197
01:07:04,785 --> 01:07:07,181
How is this web supposed to
work on anyone?

1198
01:07:08,721 --> 01:07:11,064
Who was I ever supposed to catch
with a web like this?

1199
01:07:12,423 --> 01:07:16,129
- It's been five minutes, so the power is up.
- Okay.

1200
01:07:16,130 --> 01:07:18,297
[Five minutes is up.
The Hulk is back to being Dr. Zhee.]

1201
01:07:23,151 --> 01:07:29,422
[Pathetic, Running Man Avengers.]

1202
01:07:38,338 --> 01:07:41,170
This is total chaos.
Total chaos!

1203
01:07:41,171 --> 01:07:44,235
- What is going on here?
- Gary, out. Gary, out.

1204
01:07:44,236 --> 01:07:45,446
He's out?

1205
01:07:47,138 --> 01:07:49,137
[What do I do?]

1206
01:07:52,876 --> 01:07:54,990
[The Fighter's ambush attack!]

1207
01:07:59,919 --> 01:08:02,924
[Captain Running Man drops
his weapon!]

1208
01:08:04,878 --> 01:08:06,514
- Sung Hoon.
- Yoo Jae Suk!

1209
01:08:06,515 --> 01:08:08,418
Let's go for a round!

1210
01:08:09,958 --> 01:08:11,773
Let's go for a round!

1211
01:08:11,774 --> 01:08:16,953
[The Fighter's power is activated!
A ring match for a full minute!]

1212
01:08:18,185 --> 01:08:19,598
What is this?

1213
01:08:20,836 --> 01:08:23,187
- What is your power?
- What?

1214
01:08:23,188 --> 01:08:24,978
- What's your power?
- My power is...

1215
01:08:25,426 --> 01:08:27,238
You can't be reckless with
your attack on me.

1216
01:08:29,706 --> 01:08:31,942
I doubt you'll be able to eliminate
my name tag so easily.

1217
01:08:32,772 --> 01:08:35,573
If you make a mistake...
it could be you getting ousted.

1218
01:08:39,770 --> 01:08:42,512
Why do you think I keep
appearing in front of you?

1219
01:08:43,919 --> 01:08:47,088
- Here, rip it off.
- Seriously!

1220
01:08:48,992 --> 01:08:51,027
[Dummy...]

1221
01:08:51,829 --> 01:08:53,140
Here, rip it off.

1222
01:08:54,453 --> 01:08:56,320
- Sung Hoon! Come on!
- Seriously!

1223
01:08:56,729 --> 01:08:58,328
- Go on and rip it off.
- What the heck!

1224
01:09:00,359 --> 01:09:02,728
- Rip it off, Sung Hoon.
- What the heck is that?

1225
01:09:02,729 --> 01:09:03,894
No, you can't.

1226
01:09:05,153 --> 01:09:07,863
[Iron Ha is seen headed in their direction.]

1227
01:09:07,864 --> 01:09:11,632
[Fires a shot from his glove weapon.]

1228
01:09:11,633 --> 01:09:13,316
What?
What is that?

1229
01:09:13,854 --> 01:09:16,654
[An ideal suit to chase his enemies away.]

1230
01:09:16,655 --> 01:09:18,344
- What is he doing?
- What is that?

1231
01:09:18,345 --> 01:09:20,166
What was that?

1232
01:09:20,167 --> 01:09:22,095
- I'll shoot again if you come any closer.
- Chansung.

1233
01:09:22,096 --> 01:09:23,557
What was that?

1234
01:09:23,558 --> 01:09:26,512
- What is that?
- What is going on here?

1235
01:09:31,690 --> 01:09:33,389
Hasn't it been a minute already?

1236
01:09:33,828 --> 01:09:35,188
- Okay.
- Where did he go?

1237
01:09:35,189 --> 01:09:38,824
[The Fighter's time in the ring
is over already.]

1238
01:09:43,176 --> 01:09:44,848
- Not me! It's not me!
- No, Sung Hoon!

1239
01:09:50,050 --> 01:09:53,609
Through the strength of
thunder and lightning!

1240
01:09:56,219 --> 01:09:58,581
[Releasing the power of thunder
in Kkuk Thor's zone.]

1241
01:09:58,582 --> 01:10:00,415
[Both of them showing off their powers.]

1242
01:10:05,397 --> 01:10:07,007
What is he doing?

1243
01:10:09,606 --> 01:10:12,508
[Thunders and lightening.
Kid hero Iron Ha acting recklessly.]

1244
01:10:12,509 --> 01:10:14,584
Hello, Master.
Up! Up!

1245
01:10:15,658 --> 01:10:16,721
Up!

1246
01:10:16,756 --> 01:10:18,936
[Almost gets caught by Master Jung
from all his reckless behavior.]

1247
01:10:20,991 --> 01:10:23,127
Why?
Aren't you on our side?

1248
01:10:24,457 --> 01:10:26,850
[Huh?]

1249
01:10:28,925 --> 01:10:31,322
[The Fighter making an appearance!]

1250
01:10:31,323 --> 01:10:33,867
Get down. I have to get down.
Sung Hoon is up here.

1251
01:10:33,868 --> 01:10:35,079
Get me down!

1252
01:10:35,080 --> 01:10:37,067
Wait, wait.
I have to get back down.

1253
01:10:37,068 --> 01:10:41,284
[Mouse caught in the barrel.
The Fighter above, Master Jung down below.]

1254
01:10:41,319 --> 01:10:43,703
I have to stay up here for now.
Stop!

1255
01:10:43,738 --> 01:10:45,583
Don't put me down!
I have to stay up here!

1256
01:10:46,146 --> 01:10:47,648
This position is perfect.

1257
01:10:50,378 --> 01:10:51,798
Jong Kook.

1258
01:10:51,799 --> 01:10:55,088
What are you doing here by yourself while
everyone else is getting caught?

1259
01:10:55,089 --> 01:10:57,266
Shouldn't you come out and face
some of our enemies?

1260
01:10:57,267 --> 01:10:58,722
- Come on out here.
- What did you say?

1261
01:10:59,200 --> 01:11:02,165
I think we'll be put in danger
if we were to step in there.

1262
01:11:02,714 --> 01:11:05,332
- We have to get rid of him, Jae Suk.
- What are you doing?

1263
01:11:06,515 --> 01:11:09,004
What are you doing?
What's your power?

1264
01:11:09,039 --> 01:11:10,863
What are you doing?

1265
01:11:11,694 --> 01:11:13,666
With the power...

1266
01:11:14,750 --> 01:11:16,992
You're dead if you even
step foot in here.

1267
01:11:21,425 --> 01:11:24,248
Iron Ha having too much fun
with his gadgets.]

1268
01:11:26,868 --> 01:11:28,318
Seriously!

1269
01:11:31,293 --> 01:11:32,432
The fire is out!

1270
01:11:33,712 --> 01:11:37,209
Iron Man!
Fly into the air!

1271
01:11:38,305 --> 01:11:41,475
Let go of me.
Let go! I'm the Iron Man!

1272
01:11:42,702 --> 01:11:44,276
- What is that?
- What do you think it is?

1273
01:11:44,688 --> 01:11:46,494
- Why? What is it?
- Come in here if you're that curious.

1274
01:11:47,750 --> 01:11:49,306
With the power...

1275
01:11:51,460 --> 01:11:52,605
With the power...

1276
01:11:53,635 --> 01:11:57,969
[The Fighter eliminates
Kkuk Thor's name tag!]

1277
01:11:57,970 --> 01:12:00,227
With the power...
With the power of what?

1278
01:12:02,903 --> 01:12:05,283
Do you know who made
his name tag so big like that?

1279
01:12:05,873 --> 01:12:07,304
Your power, my butt!

1280
01:12:07,305 --> 01:12:12,389
[Kkuk Thor and Iron Ha- Out!]

1281
01:12:13,191 --> 01:12:15,511
I haven't been able to set
foot out of here.

1282
01:12:15,512 --> 01:12:17,705
What have you been doing
inside there all night?

1283
01:12:19,012 --> 01:12:23,887
[Every single one of them is pathetic.]

1284
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:31,887
[Dr. Zhee dreaming of transforming
once more.]

1285
01:12:31,888 --> 01:12:33,590
Please.
I don't want to live as me.

1286
01:12:33,591 --> 01:12:35,531
I want to live as The Hulk.
Please!

1287
01:12:35,532 --> 01:12:37,102
I'm The Hulk!

1288
01:12:39,377 --> 01:12:43,772
[His true nature starting to
move inside him once again.]

1289
01:12:56,151 --> 01:12:57,450
[So close to breaking 170!]

1290
01:13:02,299 --> 01:13:04,834
[Eliminated by The Fighter
right before his transformation!]

1291
01:13:07,436 --> 01:13:09,156
I was right about to transform!

1292
01:13:12,017 --> 01:13:14,428
No more Hulk from now on!

1293
01:13:14,429 --> 01:13:16,391
I was just about to transform.

1294
01:13:16,392 --> 01:13:18,527
I can't believe you did that.

1295
01:13:19,200 --> 01:13:22,091
[Dr. Zhee- Out!]

1296
01:13:22,092 --> 01:13:23,409
Thank you.

1297
01:13:23,410 --> 01:13:24,865
Thank you!

1298
01:13:25,710 --> 01:13:26,978
Thank you for your efforts.

1299
01:13:26,979 --> 01:13:30,586
[I'm sorry, Dong Hyun.]

1300
01:13:39,485 --> 01:13:41,042
2PM...

1301
01:13:41,768 --> 01:13:43,593
Have you seen Chansung and Taecyeon?

1302
01:13:43,594 --> 01:13:45,895
- You can't try to shoot me again.
- I only have one shot left.

1303
01:13:45,896 --> 01:13:48,832
I have to make sure that I hit my target.
Ouch, my hand!

1304
01:13:50,582 --> 01:13:51,813
Do you know what's going on?

1305
01:13:52,984 --> 01:13:54,793
We have to work together.

1306
01:13:54,794 --> 01:13:57,784
- We're the only Running Man members left.
- There's still Ji Hyo too.

1307
01:13:58,074 --> 01:14:00,134
- Let's stay together.
- Give me my arrow.

1308
01:14:00,444 --> 01:14:01,834
I can't give you your arrow.

1309
01:14:01,835 --> 01:14:03,762
- I know you'll shoot me with it.
- I'm not going to shoot you.

1310
01:14:04,203 --> 01:14:06,148
Who's the first person that
got into your car today?

1311
01:14:06,149 --> 01:14:07,646
I'm the one who picked you up.

1312
01:14:08,464 --> 01:14:12,392
They do say that people are different
before and after their trip to the bathroom.

1313
01:14:12,781 --> 01:14:14,779
Give me the arrow.
I'll shoot it when we're in danger.

1314
01:14:17,101 --> 01:14:20,460
[The deadly chase continues even
amongst the guest members!]

1315
01:14:21,996 --> 01:14:25,532
[Master Jung's target is the 2PM Twins.]

1316
01:14:25,533 --> 01:14:26,904
You guys made me run too much.

1317
01:14:29,206 --> 01:14:32,921
[Which one of Chansung and Taecyeon has
the 'Out' sign on their back?]

1318
01:14:35,459 --> 01:14:38,691
[The older men's frightening joint attack.]

1319
01:14:41,664 --> 01:14:43,943
[Not letting the name tag
out of his grip!]

1320
01:14:44,633 --> 01:14:46,307
No!

1321
01:14:53,188 --> 01:14:56,923
[An invincible talisman on
Taecyeon's back!]

1322
01:14:59,657 --> 01:15:02,997
[Only the elimination of Chansung will

No way.

1352

- Saw who?

- He's hiding in there.
- In there?

1378

when I go after him, aren't you?

1379

No, I'm not.
Just go.

- Oh my goodness.

Please... why do you have
Ji Hyo's name?

1382

Come on!
Don't you think this is too much?

- It's me, Ji Hyo.

- You're Ji Hyo?

1393
01:19:26,913 --> 01:19:29,513
Hey, Taecyeon!
Don't just stand there!

1394
01:19:30,010 --> 01:19:31,747
After all these years of knowing each other,
how can you just stand there?

1395

- Come on.
- Do you want me to help you?

1397
01:19:34,488 --> 01:19:35,834
- What?
- Do you want me to help you?

1398
01:19:36,663 --> 01:19:39,532
You need to be helping with him,
not with me.

1399
01:19:39,533 --> 01:19:41,053
- You want my help with him?
- Yeah.

1400

Come on.
What am I supposed to do here?

1408

will be the end of me.

- You won't?

[Ace Ji Hyo escaping his clutches!]

1486
01:25:10,393 --> 01:25:12,204
Why are you so strong?

1487
01:25:16,631 --> 01:25:19,843
[Black Blank, no, Ace Ji Hyo!
Faces off in a real battle!]

1488
01:25:26,136 --> 01:25:27,953
[Her name tag is within his grip!]

1489
01:25:33,309 --> 01:25:35,937
[Ji Hyo's crucial attack!]

1490
01:25:39,109 --> 01:25:40,527
You're good.

1491
01:25:40,528 --> 01:25:41,982
She's really good!

1492
01:25:45,933 --> 01:25:48,349
[The Fighter with a new glint
in his eye!]

1493
01:25:49,587 --> 01:25:51,273
[He grabs it again!]

1494
01:25:55,362 --> 01:25:56,811
No, it won't rip off!

1495
01:26:03,446 --> 01:26:04,657
I can't get it off her back!

1496
01:26:10,847 --> 01:26:11,983
I can't get it off!

1497
01:26:21,059 --> 01:26:22,566
- Are you okay?
- Yes, I'm fine.

1498
01:26:22,567 --> 01:26:23,642
[Black Blank- Out!]

1499
01:26:24,915 --> 01:26:29,059
[She may have lost the battle,
but she is our eternal Ace!]

1500
01:26:29,875 --> 01:26:33,121
[And The Fighter who fought with only
one arm just as he promised...]

1501
01:26:33,122 --> 01:26:34,971
[Now!]

1502
01:26:35,507 --> 01:26:39,092
[The ultimate martial arts director...]

1503
01:26:40,234 --> 01:26:42,991
[And the strongest fighter.]

1504
01:26:43,518 --> 01:26:46,332
Let's go for a round!

1505
01:26:52,927 --> 01:26:55,756
[The ultimate battle between the two men
with their pride on the line.]

1506
01:26:55,757 --> 01:26:57,113
- It's an honor.
- No, the honor is mine.

1507
01:26:58,582 --> 01:27:00,392
[Once the cordial greeting
is out of the way...]

1508
01:27:08,048 --> 01:27:09,156
Okay!

1509
01:27:09,157 --> 01:27:12,224
[The two dragons will
face off with each other in this ring!]

1510
01:27:13,509 --> 01:27:16,639
[Real life fighter, Chu Sung Hoon.]

1511
01:27:16,640 --> 01:27:20,289
[VS. Action Master, Jung Doo Hong.]

1512
01:27:20,290 --> 01:27:23,019
[The two of Korea's biggest legends
faces each other in this ring!]

1513
01:27:32,920 --> 01:27:35,976
[When it comes to strength,
The Fighter is unbeatable.]

1514
01:27:42,514 --> 01:27:45,306
[But Master Jung
easily escapes his clutches.]

1515
01:27:52,532 --> 01:27:57,010
[Each fighting with their own styles.
Who will win the battle?]

1516
01:28:06,630 --> 01:28:09,956
[Master Jung attacks with
lightning fast speed.]

1517
01:28:11,429 --> 01:28:12,826
As expected...

1518
01:28:15,654 --> 01:28:18,532
[Battle getting fiercer and fiercer.]

1519
01:28:21,850 --> 01:28:24,306
[The Fighter moves in on
Master Jung's back!]

1520
01:28:32,730 --> 01:28:34,901
[Fighter moves in first to grab
Master Jung by his back!]

1521
01:28:34,902 --> 01:28:37,359
[And eliminates Master Jung's
name tag!]

1522
01:28:40,824 --> 01:28:42,252
Yes!

1523
01:28:42,859 --> 01:28:44,484
Yes!

1524
01:28:44,951 --> 01:28:48,679
[The ultimate winner,
The Fighter, Chu Sung Hoon!]

1525
01:28:48,680 --> 01:28:50,900
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1526
01:28:57,901 --> 01:29:00,140
[And thus...]

1527
01:29:00,141 --> 01:29:03,154
[Running Man Avengers were defeated.]

1528
01:29:04,706 --> 01:29:08,164
[Several days later...]

1529
01:29:11,991 --> 01:29:15,441
[Giraffe Eye called into
an unidentifiable room.]

1530
01:29:18,178 --> 01:29:20,208
[Taking his rage out on the bow.]

1531
01:29:25,860 --> 01:29:27,045
What is this?

1532
01:29:27,701 --> 01:29:29,128
Team Avengers?

1533
01:29:38,105 --> 01:29:39,743
What right do you think you have?

1534
01:29:41,769 --> 01:29:44,430
[The one called him in is none other
than Director Dong Fury.]

1535
01:29:44,431 --> 01:29:45,590
Director Nick Fury!

1536
01:29:46,135 --> 01:29:47,677
No, it's Dong Fury.

1537
01:29:49,685 --> 01:29:52,133
It's Team Avengers
performance evaluation.

1538
01:29:52,999 --> 01:29:54,454
Performance evaluation?

1539
01:29:55,217 --> 01:29:58,123
- This is all our performance evaluation?
- Captain Running Man.

1540
01:29:58,124 --> 01:29:59,725
Team Leader.

1541
01:29:59,726 --> 01:30:03,714
Wasn't able to lead the team as a leader,
and was too focused on his own win

1542
01:30:03,715 --> 01:30:05,838
which led to joining hands
and working together with the enemy.

1543
01:30:05,838 --> 01:30:08,330
That's correct.
He's the one who ousted me!

1544
01:30:08,331 --> 01:30:09,646
Unsuitable!

1545
01:30:12,034 --> 01:30:14,499
- What does 'Unsuitable' mean?
- Thor, the God of Thunder.

1546
01:30:15,333 --> 01:30:18,096
Even with his strength and
excellent physical abilities

1547
01:30:18,097 --> 01:30:20,321
he failed to protect his own
team members.

1548
01:30:20,815 --> 01:30:23,979
He hid out of his concern for his own safety,
and fell to his own demise.

1549
01:30:23,980 --> 01:30:26,066
That's correct.
That's an accurate description.

1550
01:30:26,067 --> 01:30:27,188
Unsuitable!

1551
01:30:28,701 --> 01:30:30,722
- What's 'Unsuitable'?
- Iron Man.

1552
01:30:30,723 --> 01:30:33,407
Classic narcissistic personality.
Unsuitable.

1553
01:30:33,408 --> 01:30:34,621
The Hulk.

1554
01:30:34,622 --> 01:30:36,393
Out of control.
Unsuitable.

1555
01:30:37,295 --> 01:30:39,792
Spiderman.
Lacks in ability to understand. Unsuitable.

1556
01:30:39,793 --> 01:30:42,544
You can't find him unsuitable for that.
That's just how he normally is.

1557
01:30:42,908 --> 01:30:44,351
Giraffe Eye.

1558
01:30:44,352 --> 01:30:48,258
I never just think of myself,
but I always put everyone first.

1559
01:30:48,259 --> 01:30:50,698
- Unsuitable.
- No, wait!

1560
01:30:54,492 --> 01:30:55,602
Black Blank.

1561
01:30:55,603 --> 01:30:58,057
She was the last sole survivor
of the Avenger's Team.

1562
01:30:58,058 --> 01:31:00,237
She's a total wildcat.
She only cares for her own survival.

1563
01:31:00,238 --> 01:31:02,800
Extreme improvisational skills,
outstanding ability to overcome danger.

1564
01:31:02,801 --> 01:31:05,897
Passed as the ultimate member
of the Avengers Team.

1565
01:31:05,898 --> 01:31:08,160
What the heck does that mean?
She really passed?

1566
01:31:09,845 --> 01:31:11,784
You mean you evaluated all of us?

1567
01:31:12,665 --> 01:31:14,093
What is this?

1568
01:31:14,094 --> 01:31:16,121
There's not much time left.

1569
01:31:16,122 --> 01:31:17,469
Time?

1570
01:31:18,549 --> 01:31:21,381
There's no time?
But aren't the Avengers over?

1571
01:31:21,675 --> 01:31:23,507
A war is approaching.

1572
01:31:24,597 --> 01:31:26,080
Prepare yourself.

1573
01:31:26,585 --> 01:31:28,682
Another battle is approaching us?

1574
01:31:29,117 --> 01:31:30,377
Director Dong Fury!

1575
01:31:31,111 --> 01:31:32,803
What does that mean?
Dong Fury!

1576
