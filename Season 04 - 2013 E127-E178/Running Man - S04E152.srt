[Variety show's rookie, Jung Woo Sung-
He shows us how it's done?]

4
00:00:06,667 --> 00:00:09,092
[Early vacation that they're
learning to enjoy with their whole bodies.]

5
00:00:09,093 --> 00:00:13,883
[Will Jung Woo Sung become a fixture in
variety land only after two shows?]

6
00:00:13,884 --> 00:00:15,779
[We are the rulers of variety land!]

7
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:16,940
[And...]

8
00:00:16,941 --> 00:00:18,905
[The eternal captain... Park Ji Sung!]

9
00:00:18,906 --> 00:00:20,429
[I love you, SBS?]

10
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:21,842
How about a video message?

11
00:00:21,843 --> 00:00:23,890
[Tough video message.]

12
00:00:23,891 --> 00:00:26,305
- Where did you guys meet?
- Is she a good cook?

13
00:00:26,306 --> 00:00:28,445
What was it about her
that made you fall for her?

14
00:00:29,138 --> 00:00:30,484
[And...]

15
00:00:30,485 --> 00:00:31,756
Do you have any interest in coming back?

16
00:00:31,757 --> 00:00:33,019

00:00:35,774 --> 00:00:39,180
[One bright summer morning-
At a busy gas station.]

19
00:00:40,538 --> 00:00:43,269
[Yoo Hyuk dressed in blue floral shirt.]

20
00:00:44,369 --> 00:00:45,580
Hello.

21
00:00:46,467 --> 00:00:49,805
- What's going on today?
- Please wait for the other members.

22
00:00:50,251 --> 00:00:55,005
Ah... seriously. Why is he
wearing sunglasses on a cloudy day?

23
00:00:55,006 --> 00:00:57,000
Come on, seriously.

24
00:00:57,508 --> 00:00:59,226
- What are you doing?
- What?

25
00:00:59,227 --> 00:01:01,914
- Why are you walking like that?
- Because I'm in a good mood.

26
00:01:01,915 --> 00:01:04,992
- Why are you in a good mood?
- Isn't it nice to be outdoors again?

27
00:01:04,993 --> 00:01:07,147
How nice is it to be working out here?

28
00:01:07,578 --> 00:01:10,559
Why do you have your shirt
opened up like that?

29
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,255
- Don't you know what this look is?
- What is it?

30
00:01:12,256 --> 00:01:14,297
This is like what he looked like
in 'City of the Rising Sun'.

31
00:01:14,298 --> 00:01:17,658
This is what Jung Woo Sung dressed like
in the movie, 'City of the Rising Sun.'

32
00:01:18,795 --> 00:01:23,565
[Is he making a comparison?
This is the original look...]

33
00:01:24,068 --> 00:01:26,651
- As you can see from your clothes...
- We're on opposing teams.

34
00:01:26,894 --> 00:01:28,245
I like being on different teams.

35
00:01:28,246 --> 00:01:30,652
Your teams will be divided up depending on
the color of the shirt that they're wearing.

36
00:01:30,653 --> 00:01:33,202
- Really?
- I wonder who'll be on my team.

37
00:01:35,059 --> 00:01:37,494
[Mr. Gary in a blue floral shirt.]

38
00:01:38,278 --> 00:01:40,219
- Gary!
- I think he's on your team.

39
00:01:41,677 --> 00:01:43,079
Hello.

40
00:01:44,377 --> 00:01:46,319
- It's Kwang Soo. Ugh...
- Ugh...

41
00:01:48,349 --> 00:01:52,357
[And 2PM's Junho rejoining the gang
after his appearance last week.]

42
00:01:55,678 --> 00:01:59,173
[New hope for the
otherwise dismal Red Team.]

43
00:01:59,174 --> 00:02:00,620
Junho, why are you dressed in red?

44
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:03,330
[Excited Haroro arrives for the fun getaway.]

45
00:02:03,331 --> 00:02:04,786
- The teams are divided up already?
- Hi, Ha Ha.

46
00:02:04,787 --> 00:02:07,529
- Come here. Come join us.
- I'm stuck with the nagger?

47
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:08,700
- Come here.
- Is this it?

48
00:02:08,701 --> 00:02:11,546
Both the teams are led by naggers.
Our situation is no better than yours.

49
00:02:11,547 --> 00:02:13,353
I bet that the teams are
divided up like this on purpose.

50
00:02:13,354 --> 00:02:15,945
- Why?
- Think of Woo Sung on your team.

51
00:02:16,349 --> 00:02:18,732
It would be just as funny no matter
who's team he's on.

52
00:02:18,733 --> 00:02:21,078
- You'd look so funny standing next to him.
- That goes without saying.

53
00:02:21,079 --> 00:02:22,947
I don't envy you guys.

54
00:02:22,948 --> 00:02:26,329
You guys look like Junho's entourage.
The entertainment firm's president

55
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:29,491
with his manager,
and you as the coordinator.

56
00:02:29,492 --> 00:02:31,608
- That's hilarious.
- You're the coordinator.

57
00:02:31,609 --> 00:02:33,536
[A rare sight of a muscle bound coordinator.]

58
00:02:33,537 --> 00:02:35,332
- I see someone else coming.
- Where? Oh, it's Song Ji Hyo.

59
00:02:35,333 --> 00:02:37,665
[Blank Ji dressed in a blue floral shirt.]

60
00:02:38,253 --> 00:02:39,539
Good morning!

61
00:02:39,813 --> 00:02:42,071
- Why are you angry, Ji Hyo? You look angry.
- I feel like it's my wife coming home.

62
00:02:42,072 --> 00:02:46,786
It puts me in a bad mood when Kwang Soo
greets me so happily first thing in the morning.

63
00:02:46,823 --> 00:02:49,286
- It puts you in a bad mood?
- What's that supposed to mean?

64
00:02:49,287 --> 00:02:51,166
Why would I put you in a bad mood?

65
00:02:51,167 --> 00:02:54,503
Stop greeting me so happily
in the morning from now on.

66
00:02:55,447 --> 00:02:57,682
- It puts me in a bad mood.
- That's so funny.

67
00:02:57,683 --> 00:02:59,564
- What the heck?
- Don't greet her happily anymore.

68
00:02:59,565 --> 00:03:01,309
From now on, don't greet me
so happily in the mornings.

69
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:03,768
- Don't say hi to her.
- Just don't even greet me anymore.

70
00:03:04,387 --> 00:03:05,935
I haven't greeted you.

71
00:03:05,936 --> 00:03:07,893
I didn't want to put you in a bad mood.

72
00:03:08,037 --> 00:03:09,670
- Hyo Joo's here. Hyo Joo's here!
- Where?

73
00:03:11,267 --> 00:03:12,644
Hi, Hyo Joo!

74
00:03:12,645 --> 00:03:14,534
- Hello!
- Hi, Hyo Joo!

75
00:03:14,535 --> 00:03:16,881
- You're on our team!
- You're as lively as ever.

76
00:03:17,884 --> 00:03:20,734
- Don't act so lively in the mornings.
- Hi, Hyo Joo.

77
00:03:20,735 --> 00:03:22,319
Seeing you so lively puts us in a bad mood.

78
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,013
- You look so pretty.
- Don't even greet us.

79
00:03:25,746 --> 00:03:28,932
[And...]

80
00:03:28,933 --> 00:03:32,351
[The floral shirt legend,
Jung Woo Sung makes his appearance.]

81
00:03:33,711 --> 00:03:35,676
I don't think I've ever seen
Woo Sung in a hat before.

82
00:03:35,677 --> 00:03:37,930
- Hello.
- Hello, Woo Sung!

83
00:03:37,931 --> 00:03:39,174
Hello.

84
00:03:39,175 --> 00:03:42,106
It's 'City of the Rising Sun'!
'City of the Rising Sun'!

85
00:03:42,259 --> 00:03:44,506
Wow, we get to see it in person.

86
00:03:44,507 --> 00:03:47,282
I'm going to look so ugly
standing next to him.

87
00:03:47,283 --> 00:03:49,614
- Wow, that's too hilarious.
- Doesn't this look so funny?

88
00:03:49,615 --> 00:03:51,702
So this is our team?
Woo Sung's on our team?

89
00:03:51,998 --> 00:03:54,288
See? Real stars don't wear sunglasses.

90
00:03:54,289 --> 00:03:56,226
But you're always wearing your sunglasses.

91
00:03:56,227 --> 00:03:58,936
- I was just about to take off my sunglasses.
- They think they're too cool for the cameras.

92
00:03:58,937 --> 00:04:03,034
Take a good look.
The real stars don't wear sunglasses.

93
00:04:03,035 --> 00:04:04,736
Look at how the real stars don't
even wear their sunglasses.

94
00:04:04,737 --> 00:04:06,514
<i>You will be divided up into
these two teams today.</i>

95
00:04:06,515 --> 00:04:09,838
<i>Today's race is, Early Vacation Race.</i>

96
00:04:09,839 --> 00:04:13,614
[Today's race-
Early Vacation Race.]

97
00:04:15,694 --> 00:04:17,116
- What is this?
- Is it Dong Wan?

98
00:04:17,117 --> 00:04:19,463
- How long have you been back there for?
- When did you get here?

99
00:04:19,629 --> 00:04:23,192
<i>What you see in front of you right now
are your prizes for the day.</i>

100
00:04:23,622 --> 00:04:27,138
[From a TV to a tent,
12 generous different vacation giveaways.]

101
00:04:27,423 --> 00:04:30,109
<i>What you see behind you
is the giveaway number board.</i>

102
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:33,031
<i>As you probably know already,
you can't just take those with you.</i>

103
00:04:33,071 --> 00:04:35,743
<i>The two teams will be combating each other
in a series of different games.</i>

104
00:04:35,744 --> 00:04:37,487
<i>And at the end of each game</i>

105
00:04:37,488 --> 00:04:41,920
<i>the team that won the game will get to choose
two numbers from the numbers board.</i>

106
00:04:42,001 --> 00:04:44,980
<i>The winning team gets to pick their first two
and then the loser team picks their two.</i>

107
00:04:44,981 --> 00:04:49,880
<i>So the team that chooses the prize behind
the number chosen wins that prize for now.</i>

108
00:04:49,881 --> 00:04:52,138
<i>And at the end of the very
final competition</i>

109
00:04:52,139 --> 00:04:55,110
<i>the winning team of that final competition
gets to win all of the prizes.</i>

110
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:03,182
You look cool just standing there
and listening to the explanation of the rules.

111
00:05:03,183 --> 00:05:04,536
[Even cool about how he
listens to the explanation.]

112
00:05:05,405 --> 00:05:07,288
I thought he was shooting a
beer commercial.

113
00:05:07,289 --> 00:05:09,214
I'm going to follow and copy him
with everything that he does today.

114
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:12,041
Yeah, it's funnier if you copy him.
That would be funnier.

115
00:05:12,167 --> 00:05:14,208
That really is a comic show.

116
00:05:14,209 --> 00:05:15,489
[A definite world of difference.]

117
00:05:16,696 --> 00:05:18,974
- Why aren't you talking, Hyo Joo?
- What's wrong?

118
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:20,375
Was yesterday too tough on you?

119
00:05:20,376 --> 00:05:22,389
Are you upset?
You look like you're upset.

120
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:26,121
No, not at all.
I'm going to try to be more gentle today.

121
00:05:26,122 --> 00:05:28,449
What a joke. You think
that suits you on Running Man?

122
00:05:28,476 --> 00:05:30,903
- What are you talking about?
- Why is she trying to be more gentle?

123
00:05:32,063 --> 00:05:34,200
[She's not falling for it!
An automatic reflex by now.]

124
00:05:34,201 --> 00:05:36,412
- She's so strong with it now.
- She's comfortable with it now.

125
00:05:36,413 --> 00:05:37,503
She's more forceful with it.

126
00:05:37,538 --> 00:05:39,431
[Ah... I was trying to be more gentle today.]

127
00:05:40,672 --> 00:05:42,097
Let's all get going.

128
00:05:42,098 --> 00:05:43,799
- Let's go.
- Yes, let's go!

129
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:48,009
[Early Vacation Race- Starts now!]

130
00:05:49,879 --> 00:05:53,018
- Everyone needs to put on their seatbelts.
- Okay.

131
00:05:53,413 --> 00:05:55,119
<i>[Early Vacation Race]</i>

132
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,350
<i>[Go to Jeondongri and
find the Running Man landmark.]</i>

133
00:05:58,351 --> 00:06:00,115
- Okay, Jeongdongri?
- Yes.

134
00:06:00,116 --> 00:06:02,520
- We're on our way.
- This is so nice!

135
00:06:02,521 --> 00:06:04,714
[Everyone on their way with excitement
to their first vacation of the summer!]

136
00:06:04,715 --> 00:06:06,560
- Wow!
- Jeongdongri? Not Jungdongji, right?

137
00:06:06,561 --> 00:06:08,362
You two are friends, right?

138
00:06:08,363 --> 00:06:12,620
Since Jae Suk is friends with Jung Jae,
and you're friends with Jung Jae

139
00:06:12,621 --> 00:06:13,728
does mean that the two of you
are friends?

140
00:06:13,729 --> 00:06:16,378
- No, it doesn't really work that way.
- The reason being...

141
00:06:16,379 --> 00:06:18,730
He was born in '72, and I was born in '73.

142
00:06:18,731 --> 00:06:22,409
- Really?
- So us being friends would complicate things.

143
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:27,273
I don't think befriending a friend of a friend
and mixing it up like that is a good idea.

144
00:06:28,619 --> 00:06:31,633
- You think so?
- Then Jae Suk would be your 'older brother'?

145
00:06:31,634 --> 00:06:32,981
Of course.

146
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:36,610
Jung Jae and I are friends because
we were in the army together.

147
00:06:37,667 --> 00:06:41,475
But Woo Sung and Jung Jae still use
honorifics towards one another, don't you?

148
00:06:41,476 --> 00:06:42,655
- Yeah.
- To each other?

149
00:06:42,656 --> 00:06:43,667
- Really?
- Yes.

150
00:06:43,668 --> 00:06:45,909
- Even after being friends all these years.
- Why?

151
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:47,659
That's what we're comfortable with.

152
00:06:47,755 --> 00:06:50,287
That's how we show respect to
each other as fellow actors.

153
00:06:50,288 --> 00:06:51,415
- Really?
- Yes.

154
00:06:51,416 --> 00:06:52,528
That's so cool.

155
00:06:52,529 --> 00:06:54,500
- Mr. Ha Ha!
- Yes, Mr. Gary?

156
00:06:55,986 --> 00:06:58,196
- Hope you have a wonderful day today.
- Thank you, Sir.

157
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:00,582
- Let's have a meal together sometime.
- Yes, of course.

158
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:05,282
Even though we're not really stiff about it,
we do like to use honorifics.

159
00:07:05,283 --> 00:07:07,137
- What are we going to be doing today?
- I had no idea you guys did that.

160
00:07:07,138 --> 00:07:09,384
- Wow...
- They're like a happily married couple.

161
00:07:09,712 --> 00:07:13,160
I think with how they treat each other,
they probably never fight.

162
00:07:13,161 --> 00:07:15,362
- Yes, you're right. We've never fought.
- I bet you're right.

163
00:07:15,363 --> 00:07:18,447
- To be so polite to your friend like that...
- I had no idea.

164
00:07:18,448 --> 00:07:22,944
Since it makes us reconsider our actions
to one another before doing them

165
00:07:22,945 --> 00:07:25,303
we find that we don't really
do anything offensive to one another.

166
00:07:25,303 --> 00:07:27,608
- So we've never fought.
- Wow, that's amazing.

167
00:07:27,608 --> 00:07:29,257
No casual speech to actresses either?

168
00:07:29,258 --> 00:07:33,108
I don't really lower
my speech with them at first.

169
00:07:33,109 --> 00:07:34,769
But once some time passes,
and we get to know each other better...

170
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:37,701
There was a time when the director yelled
cut during the filming of 'Love Story'

171
00:07:37,702 --> 00:07:41,576
and when I asked if she was okay,
using honorifics then felt rather greasy.

172
00:07:41,577 --> 00:07:43,129
- That didn't feel right.
- You're right.

173
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:46,728
It's actually better to be
more casual in times like that.

174
00:07:46,729 --> 00:07:48,010
You okay?

175
00:07:49,119 --> 00:07:50,761
[Mr. Gary showing us how it's done.]

176
00:07:50,762 --> 00:07:53,043
- What about Ji Hyo?
- Ask Ji Hyo if she's okay.

177
00:07:53,044 --> 00:07:54,759
Ji Hyo, are you okay?

178
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:57,654
So that's how it's done!

179
00:07:57,655 --> 00:07:59,752
Nice... that was pretty good.

180
00:07:59,753 --> 00:08:02,837
- He said it differently than you.
- But she's different.

181
00:08:02,837 --> 00:08:04,731
- Why?
- As soon as I saw her yesterday...

182
00:08:04,732 --> 00:08:07,005
I ran in on her and eliminated her
without even saying anything to her.

183
00:08:07,006 --> 00:08:09,296
- He was the Grim Reaper yesterday.
- I thought your eyes were shooting out fire.

184
00:08:09,297 --> 00:08:11,005
They were shooting out flames of fire.

185
00:08:11,811 --> 00:08:14,018
[Last week...]

186
00:08:14,019 --> 00:08:17,804
[Jung Woo Sung, who turned a variety show
into a scene out of an action movie.]

187
00:08:18,277 --> 00:08:21,124
[But today, he's being
transformed into a comedian?]

188
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:24,756
- Don't you know that this is a variety show?
- Watch and learn.

189
00:08:24,757 --> 00:08:27,316
[A promising variety newbie.]

190
00:08:32,322 --> 00:08:33,798
[Running Man Vacation Plans.]

191
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:35,218
[Farming field snack game.]

192
00:08:35,219 --> 00:08:36,656
There... there it is.

193
00:08:36,657 --> 00:08:39,815
[Arriving at the first
Early Vacation Race location.]

194
00:08:41,002 --> 00:08:43,728
Wait, this is like the last time
when Hyo Joo was here...

195
00:08:44,739 --> 00:08:48,010
You can each choose one that you like
and change into it.

196
00:08:48,011 --> 00:08:50,191
Woo Sung, you have to choose
one for yourself.

197
00:08:50,192 --> 00:08:51,905
- Seriously?
- You can choose first.

198
00:08:53,554 --> 00:08:57,615
- I think I'm going to go with this one.
- You sure that's not too fashionable for you?

199
00:08:57,616 --> 00:09:00,449
I think I'll go with this grey one.

200
00:09:01,571 --> 00:09:03,500
Kwang Soo loves the animal prints.

201
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:05,744
You're right.
Kwang Soo does like the animal prints.

202
00:09:06,582 --> 00:09:09,665
But I can't forsake
my preference for him either.

203
00:09:09,665 --> 00:09:11,567
Yes, you're right.
You go with the one you want.

204
00:09:11,568 --> 00:09:13,742
But those pants on you...

205
00:09:13,743 --> 00:09:16,727
- What the heck?
- It's taking on a European feel.

206
00:09:16,728 --> 00:09:18,521
That's not how they're supposed to look.

207
00:09:18,939 --> 00:09:22,292
[Even the work pants
takes on a fashionable look.]

208
00:09:23,472 --> 00:09:27,256
[The man who turned a farming field
into an instant runway.]

209
00:09:30,121 --> 00:09:32,151
Should I change my pants to match
the rest of my team?

210
00:09:32,152 --> 00:09:33,522
Yes, change into this one.

211
00:09:33,523 --> 00:09:38,367
- Okay, I'll do it for the team.
- See? You're supposed to look like Gary.

212
00:09:38,368 --> 00:09:40,689
[The correct way the work-pants
are supposed to look.]

213
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:42,590
They're supposed to look like the way
they look on Gary right now.

214
00:09:42,591 --> 00:09:44,942
[His body was made to wear the work-pants.]

215
00:09:45,692 --> 00:09:48,458
[So that's what it is...
The body made for a variety show...]

216
00:09:48,772 --> 00:09:51,919
- Then should we switch our pants?
- Want to try switching?

217
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,953
Yes, try switching with him.
It could be the pants.

218
00:09:53,954 --> 00:09:56,333
- Yes, it could be the pants.
- I want to look like Gary.

219
00:09:56,950 --> 00:09:59,546
These pants are very special to me,
but I will still give them to you.

220
00:10:00,421 --> 00:10:03,721
- I think you're getting there.
- That's not it either.

221
00:10:03,722 --> 00:10:06,744
[What?
But those are the same pants!]

222
00:10:07,524 --> 00:10:09,698
How did those pants all of a sudden
turn into shorts?

223
00:10:09,699 --> 00:10:11,698
They look like nice shorts on him.

224
00:10:11,699 --> 00:10:15,093
[They look like three quarter length
work-pants on him.]

225
00:10:15,685 --> 00:10:18,066
They should be pulled over
your bellybutton.

226
00:10:18,352 --> 00:10:20,711
But even those pants look the way they're
supposed to look on Gary.

227
00:10:20,712 --> 00:10:24,263
[No matter what bachelor Gae wears...]

228
00:10:24,264 --> 00:10:25,953
It's the perfect length on him.

229
00:10:25,954 --> 00:10:27,587
[The perfect fit all the way from
his bellybutton right down to his ankles.]

230
00:10:27,588 --> 00:10:30,181
- That's the way they're supposed to fit.
- That's the correct fit.

231
00:10:31,536 --> 00:10:34,918
There's nothing we can do about it.
Kwang Soo... yours is right here.

232
00:10:34,918 --> 00:10:36,168
Thank you, Jae Suk!

233
00:10:36,169 --> 00:10:38,279
- It's the giraffe print.
- Not the giraffe print, but a leopard print.

234
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,346
[Zebra or a leopard print...]

235
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:42,506
- Do you remember this, Hyo Joo?
- Yes. I'm all too familiar with this.

236
00:10:42,507 --> 00:10:44,076
[All too familiar work-pants to Hyo Joo.]

237
00:10:44,077 --> 00:10:46,114
- You get to wear the pants again.
- This is a familiar sight.

238
00:10:46,115 --> 00:10:49,638
- They look like a stage costume on Junho.
- They look good on Junho too.

239
00:10:49,639 --> 00:10:52,494
[They look like a stage costume for Junho!]

240
00:10:52,495 --> 00:10:54,760
- They look the best on Gary.
- Isn't it perfect on Gary?

241
00:10:54,761 --> 00:10:56,494
You look like you were born
to wear those pants.

242
00:10:56,495 --> 00:10:59,290
I actually gave my original
pair of pants to Woo Sung.

243
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:01,004
I really wanted his pants.

244
00:11:02,047 --> 00:11:03,225
<i>Okay, everyone.</i>

245
00:11:03,226 --> 00:11:05,506
<i>The name of the first game of the
Early Vacation Race is...</i>

246
00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:08,206
<i>Watermelon loyalty game.</i>

247
00:11:08,207 --> 00:11:09,625
[Watermelon loyalty eating game.]

248
00:11:09,626 --> 00:11:12,255
<i>Watermelon is supposed to be the
specialty in this region.</i>

249
00:11:12,256 --> 00:11:15,140
<i>They're supposed to be very delicious.</i>

250
00:11:15,703 --> 00:11:18,537
- Does anyone know what the loyalty game is?
- Isn't it like a relay?

251
00:11:18,538 --> 00:11:20,801
The last person left has to eat
the remainder of the watermelon?

252
00:11:20,802 --> 00:11:23,329
<i>The members of the team will run around
the course in a relay</i>

253
00:11:23,330 --> 00:11:26,418
<i>and have to eat a whole watermelon
in order to finish the relay.</i>

254
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:27,843
- The whole watermelon?
- Yes, the whole thing.

255
00:11:27,844 --> 00:11:29,520
This really is a watermelon eating contest.

256
00:11:29,521 --> 00:11:32,540
The game will be played best out of three.

257
00:11:33,609 --> 00:11:36,171
[One whole watermelon has been cut up
in several pieces of various different sizes.]

258
00:11:36,172 --> 00:11:37,898
- You go first, and he'll be the second.
- I think that would be best.

259
00:11:37,899 --> 00:11:41,620
You'll be first, he'll be second, you third,
I'll be the fourth and Hyo Joo the last.

260
00:11:41,621 --> 00:11:45,223
But it's possible that all the watermelon
will be gone with the second person.

261
00:11:45,224 --> 00:11:47,943
- Really? You think he'll do that?
- Yes, I'm serious.

262
00:11:49,214 --> 00:11:52,780
No matter how you guys decide,
you'll have to go by what Jong Kook says.

263
00:11:52,781 --> 00:11:55,515
Why don't you just tell us what to do?
Tell us what the order is going to be.

264
00:11:55,516 --> 00:11:57,651
- Why even bother discussing it?
- No kidding.

265
00:11:58,311 --> 00:12:00,227
- Suk Jin...
- Just do whatever you want then.

266
00:12:00,228 --> 00:12:02,578
We're all just standing around here
waiting for him to make the decision.

267
00:12:02,579 --> 00:12:05,943
- What are you talking about?
- You have two guests on your team.

268
00:12:05,944 --> 00:12:07,437
What are you doing?

269
00:12:07,438 --> 00:12:10,693
[With the two guests on the team,
all are waiting for Captain Kkuk to decide.]

270
00:12:10,694 --> 00:12:13,284
Why don't we all gather around
and say a cheer?

271
00:12:13,285 --> 00:12:15,117
- Fighting.
- Whatever.

272
00:12:15,118 --> 00:12:16,237
[Forcing them into a cheer.]

273
00:12:16,238 --> 00:12:18,862
- Come on.
- How many times do we have to cheer?

274
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:20,587
[His bulldozer-like leadership skills
are starting to surface.]

275
00:12:20,588 --> 00:12:22,855
Do you want so trade places with me
so you can see what it's like, Woo Sung?

276
00:12:22,856 --> 00:12:24,056
- No, that's okay.
- Seriously.

277
00:12:24,057 --> 00:12:25,983
Why are you forcing us into this?

278
00:12:25,984 --> 00:12:27,714
[All the teammates full of displeasure.]

279
00:12:27,715 --> 00:12:29,914
- Jong Kook is starting to use his hands.
- Come on, let's go.

280
00:12:31,453 --> 00:12:33,032
[Watermelon loyalty eating contest-
Round One.]

281
00:12:33,032 --> 00:12:35,032
You want the small piece or
the big piece?

282
00:12:35,483 --> 00:12:37,926
[First runners up- Jong Kook of the Red Team
and Woo Sung of the Blue Team.]

283

Nice, Woo Sung!

284
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:50,538
[The two alpha males giving a proper
watermelon eating show.]

285
00:12:52,587 --> 00:12:54,120
That's unbelievable.

286
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:59,190
- Jong Kook's really fast too.
- Come on, Warrior!

287
00:12:59,191 --> 00:13:00,420
Warrior?

288
00:13:00,421 --> 00:13:02,327
Jong Kook, did you hear?
She's calling for her warrior!

289
00:13:02,434 --> 00:13:06,067
- Show me what you're capable of!
- What a joke!

290
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:08,183
Do you want a leg flip?

291
00:13:08,184 --> 00:13:10,752
Look at Woo Sung go!

without any hesitation.]

294
00:13:22,913 --> 00:13:24,817
Jong Kook, eat three more!

295
00:13:25,388 --> 00:13:27,495
You can pass it off to the next, Woo Sung.
Pass it off to the next!

296
00:13:27,496 --> 00:13:29,119
- Great job!
- There you go!

297

[Woo Sung heads off to 'R2'.]

298
00:13:33,021 --> 00:13:35,123
- Nice. Come on, Ha Ha.
- Pass it over to me.

after eating four huge pieces.]

300

Squish it down with your teeth and
get all the juices out!

a Spartan would.]

- He's Waluigi.

- Are you okay?

- How many are there left?
- More!

324
00:14:40,708 --> 00:14:42,198
Suck it down.
There you go. More!

325
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,366
There you go.

326
00:14:44,367 --> 00:14:46,556
[Wow... he finished almost all of it!]

327
00:14:48,666 --> 00:14:51,177
[And one more to cleanse his palate.]

328
00:14:51,592 --> 00:14:52,944
Chew while you run!

329
00:14:52,945 --> 00:14:54,392
- Run!
- Here he comes!

330
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:56,206
[Finally running off to pass it on.]

331
00:14:56,207 --> 00:14:57,244
- They're almost gone?
- It's all over now!

332
00:14:57,245 --> 00:14:58,832
I can't believe he ate it all!

333
00:14:59,176 --> 00:15:00,436
That's amazing.

334
00:15:02,277 --> 00:15:03,550
What the heck!

335
00:15:05,356 --> 00:15:08,046
- Here.
- Shove more in your mouth.

336
00:15:11,978 --> 00:15:14,506
[Red Team heads off to final 'R5' in ease.]

337
00:15:15,108 --> 00:15:16,989
Hand it to Hyo Joo.

338
00:15:19,566 --> 00:15:22,435
[Taking her time to finish
one tiny piece of the watermelon.]

339
00:15:22,436 --> 00:15:24,020
What the heck is this?

340
00:15:25,569 --> 00:15:27,742
Kwang Soo looks like he's
about to get sick.

341
00:15:28,216 --> 00:15:30,490
- You did great.
- I told you Kwang Soo would finish it.

342
00:15:31,841 --> 00:15:33,732
[Red Team Wins!]

343
00:15:33,733 --> 00:15:35,131
Great job.

344
00:15:35,132 --> 00:15:37,146
We won. Great job.
That wasn't so bad, was it?

345
00:15:39,378 --> 00:15:42,287
- Are you okay?
- Look at what you've done to this kid.

346
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:45,268
This just made me realize
what I'm capable of.

347
00:15:45,269 --> 00:15:47,613
I told you that he can do it.

348
00:15:47,614 --> 00:15:49,950
That's too bad.
We could've won that round.

349
00:15:50,318 --> 00:15:52,958
Why don't I start this time?

350
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:54,510
Okay, you can go first.

351
00:15:54,511 --> 00:15:58,119
- Then Woo Sung...
- You should go last.

352

[Entrusting the crucial
'R5' role to Woo Sung?]

353
00:15:59,323 --> 00:16:00,804
- I'll trust in you then.
- Yes, please take care of it.

354
00:16:03,452 --> 00:16:06,021
- Are you guys still not ready yet?
- We're ready.

355
00:16:06,022 --> 00:16:09,050
- We are ready.
- If you are, then let's hurry up and do this.

356
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:12,792
- Can't you speak in nicer tones?
- That's what I'd like to say to you.

357
00:16:13,045 --> 00:16:16,017
- That's what I'd like to say to you!
- The way you said it was rude!

358
00:16:16,018 --> 00:16:18,870
Why are you spitting
all over our watermelon?

359
00:16:18,871 --> 00:16:20,090
Seriously...

360
00:16:20,675 --> 00:16:23,185
- Your pants are on backwards.
- So what? They're my pants.

361
00:16:23,956 --> 00:16:26,146
- These are my pants.
- Your pockets are on the back.

362
00:16:26,147 --> 00:16:28,864
- These are my pants.
- Can't you speak nicer?

363
00:16:28,865 --> 00:16:31,154
- Why would I need to do that? These are mine.
- Can't you speak in a nicer tone?

364
00:16:32,273 --> 00:16:34,337
My pants are fine.
This is a fashion statement.

365
00:16:34,338 --> 00:16:36,139
- Okay, let's go!
- Yes, let's go.

366
00:16:36,555 --> 00:16:38,537
Everyone to their positions.

367
00:16:38,538 --> 00:16:39,965
- You're the fourth.
- Okay.

368
00:16:40,487 --> 00:16:43,186
- This is...
- The first person has to eat a lot.

369

- Eat three more pieces than Kwang Soo.
- Don't you worry!

373
00:16:50,989 --> 00:16:53,102
- I'll eat five more than him!
- That's my boy!

374
00:16:53,561 --> 00:16:55,689
Kwang Soo, don't think of it as eating.

375
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:57,824
You have to squish it down with your
mouth and drink it.

376
00:16:58,421 --> 00:17:00,511
How can you drink a watermelon?

377
00:17:00,512 --> 00:17:02,521
He can't stop with the instructions.
Seriously.

378
00:17:03,073 --> 00:17:05,316
[Round two-
Ro-Ro vs. Hyo Joo.]

379
00:17:05,317 --> 00:17:07,781
Hyo Joo, if you're too full to eat anymore,
pass it off to the next person.

380

- Fighting!
- There they go.

- Ha Ha! You have to eat a lot!

383
00:17:20,437 --> 00:17:21,696
Ha Ha!

384

Don't laugh!
There's no time for laughing!

Be quiet!

391
00:17:47,413 --> 00:17:49,263
Why is she always just yelling at me?

392
00:17:49,633 --> 00:17:52,242
- Don't provoke her, Kwang Soo.
- I didn't even say anything to her.

393
00:17:52,243 --> 00:17:54,539
You have to eat as much as you can, Ha Ha.

394
00:17:55,662 --> 00:17:56,850
Why don't you just...

You can't stop right now.
Keep up the pace!

399
00:18:07,308 --> 00:18:09,077
Don't do that to yourself, Dong Hoon!
Just pass it off!

400
00:18:09,649 --> 00:18:11,883
- Why is this thing so heavy?
- I couldn't eat anymore.

401
00:18:12,275 --> 00:18:14,067
Take your time.
Take your time running.

402

leaving the larger ones for others.

[Giant bites vs. Tiny bites.]

416

- What?
- What is he doing!

418

489
00:22:05,842 --> 00:22:07,962
[As if grinding down with a mixer.]

490
00:22:08,838 --> 00:22:11,200
Look at him grinding that down!
Grind that down!

491

493

Nice!
Great job, Jung Woo Sung!

494
00:22:24,664 --> 00:22:26,449
He's already done with it!
Wow, he's done!

495
00:22:28,284 --> 00:22:30,500
Just think of it as
eating a hamburger.

496
00:22:31,511 --> 00:22:33,317
[That's just absurd.]

497
00:22:34,505 --> 00:22:36,127
Come on, eat!

498
00:22:36,128 --> 00:22:37,655
You said you can do it.

499
00:22:38,568 --> 00:22:40,405
You said grind it down like a mixer
and drink it up!

500
00:22:40,406 --> 00:22:41,749
So do it like you said.

501
00:22:42,071 --> 00:22:43,809
Let's see how well you
can grind it down.

502
00:22:44,215 --> 00:22:45,803
Come on, grind it down!

503
00:22:45,804 --> 00:22:47,396
That's hilarious!

[Eating with some ease...]

505
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:52,760
We're done, we're done.

506
00:22:52,761 --> 00:22:55,160
Wow, Jung Woo Sung is
such a good eater!

507
00:22:55,427 --> 00:22:57,810
- He's no joke.
- He's like a food fighter.

508
00:22:57,811 --> 00:23:00,444
He really is a food fighter.
Jung Woo Sung, the food fighter.

509
00:23:00,445 --> 00:23:02,774
Why is he being so serious about it?

510
00:23:02,775 --> 00:23:05,113
This is a variety show.
Why are you being so serious about it?

511
00:23:05,357 --> 00:23:08,246
I'm a variety rookie.
I've got a definite feel for it now.

512
00:23:10,332 --> 00:23:13,773
Did you see his expression?
He looked like he did in his movie, 'Beat'!

513
00:23:14,244 --> 00:23:17,112
- That's what he's always like.
- We won!

514
00:23:17,802 --> 00:23:19,241
Okay!

515
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:21,334
- Okay.
- Let's go.

[Blue Team having finished their pile.]

517
00:23:29,659 --> 00:23:30,845

[You're dead!]

519
00:23:34,195 --> 00:23:35,790

Do you even want to win?

523
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:49,648
- You only ate one before you passed it off.
- Sorry, I'm sorry.

524
00:23:49,649 --> 00:23:51,669
I guess I expected too much
from Jong Kook.

525
00:23:53,524 --> 00:23:55,152
What the heck did you just say?

526
00:23:55,824 --> 00:23:58,488
- This is the last round.
- The last round.

527
00:23:58,489 --> 00:24:01,006
- This is the deciding round.
- How much do we have to eat now?

528
00:24:01,007 --> 00:24:02,454
This is all you have.

529
00:24:02,455 --> 00:24:04,445
[Final round only consists of five pieces.]

530
00:24:04,446 --> 00:24:06,738
One person can't eat all of them, right?

531
00:24:06,739 --> 00:24:08,738
Everyone has to eat one.

532
00:24:09,071 --> 00:24:11,649
- You can't have any left in the mouth either.
- How about whistle blowing?

533

<i>That's up to you guys.</i>

534
00:24:12,847 --> 00:24:15,218
The reason being,
did you see how Kwang Soo ate his?

535
00:24:15,219 --> 00:24:18,422
He went off to the next person with
his mouth still full of watermelon.

536
00:24:18,423 --> 00:24:20,192
When did I do that?

537
00:24:20,193 --> 00:24:22,677
You really like to exaggerate things.

538
00:24:22,678 --> 00:24:25,213
Just like how a squirrel stuffs his mouth
full of acorn nuts?

539
00:24:26,184 --> 00:24:28,244
He's basically saying that he's angry.

540
00:24:28,245 --> 00:24:30,360
- What's wrong with him?
- Why are you so competitive?

541
00:24:30,361 --> 00:24:33,534
I'm not being competitive,
but games should be played fair and square.

- Woo Sung is a real chatterbox.
- Yes, I see that.

544

[Woo Sung finally opening up and
talking out on the field?]

546

I have good hearing, a small heart,
and I chatter nonstop.

547
00:24:45,939 --> 00:24:48,835
- That's what I'm saying.
- So you're similar to me.

548
00:24:48,836 --> 00:24:50,822
No, you and I are not similar.

00:30:11,106 --> 00:30:13,569
- What could this be for?
- What are we going to be doing?

656
00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:15,988
I really am getting a nervous feeling.

657
00:30:15,989 --> 00:30:18,048
Why are there helmets?
What are these for?

658
00:30:18,049 --> 00:30:23,947
<i>This is the Blob Jump, which was the costliest
to set up in all 152 episodes we've done.</i>

659
00:30:23,948 --> 00:30:26,205
[Welcome to Blob Jump]

660
00:30:26,206 --> 00:30:28,662
- Blob Jumps are synonymous with vacations.
- What did you say?

661
00:30:29,958 --> 00:30:32,549
<i>This is a water sport that is enjoyed
by people all around the world.</i>

662
00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:36,503
[Currently hot trending world sport.]

663
00:30:36,504 --> 00:30:41,581
[Blob Jump having started over in Europe
makes its way over to Running Man!]

664
00:30:41,582 --> 00:30:45,284
[Early Vacation Race's second course-
Blob Jump Competition.]

665
00:30:45,285 --> 00:30:47,020
<i>This is a record competition.</i>

666
00:30:47,021 --> 00:30:50,021
<i>The team that scores the
highest jump wins.</i>

667
00:30:50,022 --> 00:30:52,438
[Three members per team will jump,
and the team with the highest record wins!]

668
00:30:52,439 --> 00:30:56,561
<i>The specialists behind you will first
demonstrate how it's done.</i>

669
00:30:56,562 --> 00:30:57,681
[Blob Jump's demonstration to start.]

670
00:30:58,488 --> 00:31:00,819
The specialists will get a high record.

671
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:03,317
- And you guys will do what you're shown.
- We're actually going to do this?

672
00:31:03,628 --> 00:31:05,896
[Step One- One person to place themselves
in front of the tube.]

673
00:31:05,897 --> 00:31:08,052
So the guy jumping right now doesn't
determine the score?

674
00:31:08,053 --> 00:31:09,998
[Oh!]

675
00:31:17,345 --> 00:31:20,163
- Are you sure that he's a specialist?
- Does he know what he's doing?

676
00:31:20,164 --> 00:31:21,876
- What's he doing?
- What was that?

677
00:31:21,877 --> 00:31:25,709
- You don't have to be cool about it.
- That was about two flips in the air.

678
00:31:25,710 --> 00:31:27,754
- Are you sure he's not an entertainer?
- You did that on purpose, right?

679
00:31:28,469 --> 00:31:30,761
He almost fell down to the water.

680
00:31:30,762 --> 00:31:33,421
Are you sure he's not a specialist
on Running Man?

681
00:31:34,163 --> 00:31:37,279
So once the other person falls,
I'm sure it makes the first one fly.

682
00:31:38,188 --> 00:31:41,048
[Step Two- The other three people
then jump onto the back of the tube.]

683
00:31:41,049 --> 00:31:44,281
Okay, take a close look.
These are specialists of the sport.

684
00:31:44,282 --> 00:31:46,433
They're going to show you their jump.
Everyone take a close look.

685
00:31:46,945 --> 00:31:48,839
One, two, three!

686
00:32:02,676 --> 00:32:05,845
[Flies high into the air and dives into
the water after midair acrobatic moves.]

687
00:32:07,677 --> 00:32:10,164
Wow, awesome!
You really are a specialist!

688
00:32:10,165 --> 00:32:12,052
[Mistake that he made a minute ago
has all been forgiven!]

689
00:32:12,677 --> 00:32:15,937
- I didn't know he'd fly so high into the air!
- What the heck is that?

690
00:32:15,938 --> 00:32:17,859
How can a person fly so high
into the air like that?

691
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:21,188
- It needs to be a lighter person up front.
- Hyo Joo, you do it. You're perfect for it.

692
00:32:21,603 --> 00:32:25,005
- That's no joke.
- How is that any different from bungee?

693
00:32:25,657 --> 00:32:27,543
Just fall on your butt.

694
00:32:27,544 --> 00:32:30,543
You just need to bend your back
while looking out into the distance.

695
00:32:30,544 --> 00:32:33,002
Because you'll be shot
straight into the air like that.

696
00:32:33,003 --> 00:32:35,014
Thank you so much.
That was very cool.

697
00:32:35,963 --> 00:32:38,321
- That was really cool.
- That was awesome!

698
00:32:38,322 --> 00:32:39,331
[That looks like fun.]

699
00:32:39,332 --> 00:32:41,489
Jong Kook, why don't you
show us how it's done?

700
00:32:41,490 --> 00:32:45,323
Since you've been telling us how good you are,
show us how it's done.

701
00:32:45,324 --> 00:32:47,693
There's no real reason for me
to do all that.

702
00:32:47,694 --> 00:32:50,110
- I was just explaining things to you.
- Since you explained it all to us...

703
00:32:50,111 --> 00:32:52,374
Why don't you show us in action
how you're really supposed to do it.

704
00:32:52,375 --> 00:32:53,404
And the three of us will jump.

705
00:32:53,405 --> 00:32:55,999
- Which one of us will do it?
- It can't be a heavy person.

706
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,564
[Important for the three people jumping
on the back to be in sync.]

707
00:32:58,565 --> 00:33:00,012
We have to land on our butt.

708
00:33:00,013 --> 00:33:03,587
- I think we need to lift up one of our legs.
- Yes, that's right.

709
00:33:03,588 --> 00:33:05,341
We need to land on our back as
we lift up one of our legs.

710
00:33:05,342 --> 00:33:09,283
And we have to focus on that red point
as our target when we jump.

711
00:33:09,507 --> 00:33:12,506
Just think of it as lying on your back
as you jump off the platform.

712
00:33:12,507 --> 00:33:14,746
- This isn't your team.
- Just think of landing on your back.

713
00:33:14,747 --> 00:33:16,480
You just go home and lay down.

714
00:33:16,734 --> 00:33:19,442
If you lift just one leg,
your body may tilt too much to the side.

715
00:33:19,443 --> 00:33:22,063
So as you lift up your leg,
you have to tilt your body backwards.

716
00:33:22,064 --> 00:33:24,663
Are you a bully of this reservoir?
What's wrong with you?

717
00:33:26,048 --> 00:33:29,131
- Why are you coming to bother us?
- No, I'm not doing that.

718
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:30,479
Seriously.

719
00:33:30,964 --> 00:33:34,130
[Playing Paper-Rock-Scissors to decide
which team will be the one to go first.]

720
00:33:35,421 --> 00:33:36,793
Paper-Rock-Scissors!

721
00:33:36,794 --> 00:33:38,215
[Win - Lose]

722
00:33:39,949 --> 00:33:41,938
Don't make me do
Paper-Rock-Scissors.

723
00:33:42,731 --> 00:33:45,611
- Can you do it with someone else?
- Paper-Rock-Scissors. I won.

724
00:33:45,612 --> 00:33:47,533
- I just won again.
- Thanks.

725
00:33:47,534 --> 00:33:49,598
Paper-Rock-Scissors.
Paper-Rock-Scissors.

726
00:33:49,599 --> 00:33:51,135
[Wins again!]

727
00:33:51,136 --> 00:33:52,887
- Let's try it again.
- Paper-Rock-Scissors.

728
00:33:52,888 --> 00:33:55,276
Come on, isn't that enough?
How many do I have to win?

729
00:33:55,277 --> 00:33:57,614
- You're going to win again.
- Paper-Rock-Scissors. Paper-Rock-Scissors.

730
00:33:57,615 --> 00:33:58,769
I'm going to say it.

731
00:33:59,395 --> 00:34:01,472
- I'm going to say it. Paper-Rock-Scissors.
- Fine, do it.

732
00:34:01,473 --> 00:34:03,816
Paper-Rock-Scissors.
Paper-Rock-Scissors.

733
00:34:03,817 --> 00:34:04,916
Paper-Rock-Scissors.

734
00:34:04,951 --> 00:34:07,594
[All- Kill!
Suk Jin wins five in a row!]

735
00:34:07,595 --> 00:34:10,409
[Big-nosed Brother truly is
a Paper-Rock-Scissors genius?]

736
00:34:10,410 --> 00:34:13,243
- How did that happen?
- It's because I was standing next to you.

737
00:34:13,635 --> 00:34:15,274
- Is that why I did so well?
- Of course.

738
00:34:15,275 --> 00:34:17,153
- Seriously...
- See? I'm a winning charm.

739
00:34:17,154 --> 00:34:20,066
Turning my Paper-Rock-Scissors winnings...
Hurry up and get up there.

740
00:34:20,067 --> 00:34:22,048
Okay, Blue Team first.

741
00:34:22,767 --> 00:34:24,568
- Me.
- You're going to jump?

742
00:34:24,569 --> 00:34:28,986
[First jumper for the Blue Team-
Jung Woo Sung.]

743
00:34:28,987 --> 00:34:34,477
[He'll be the first to challenge
the Blob Jump in Running Man history!]

744
00:34:39,221 --> 00:34:44,705
[That's... high...]

745
00:34:47,462 --> 00:34:49,339
Remember how even the specialist
rolled backwards earlier?

746
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:51,961
- He almost rolled off that thing.
- He was rolling off of it.

747
00:34:51,962 --> 00:34:53,597
It's not an easy thing to do.

748
00:34:54,072 --> 00:34:55,441
- Fighting!
- Okay.

749
00:34:55,931 --> 00:34:58,278
The Blue Team's... first human bullet.

750
00:34:58,279 --> 00:35:00,471
Just call me the human rifle.

751
00:35:00,472 --> 00:35:01,498
Okay, I'm going to jump.

752
00:35:01,533 --> 00:35:04,347
- He's so full of gusto.
- Gusto!

753
00:35:04,348 --> 00:35:06,540
- Don't try to be too cool about it.
- Woo Sung!

754
00:35:06,541 --> 00:35:11,173
[Cooley shaking the hands of
his comrades in a greeting.]

755
00:35:11,174 --> 00:35:13,597
- Is it really high up there?
- No, it's nice up here.

756
00:35:14,225 --> 00:35:17,723
- It's high, isn't it?
- It's not bad once you're up here.

757
00:35:17,724 --> 00:35:21,147
- It's not high up there?
- Your face is white as a ghost.

758
00:35:21,148 --> 00:35:23,971
- You look like you're scared.
- Are you nervous?

759
00:35:23,972 --> 00:35:26,981
- You look like you're scared.
- You know what he said earlier?

760
00:35:26,982 --> 00:35:29,727
He said he actually is scared, but he doesn't
want to show it since it's a variety show.

761
00:35:29,728 --> 00:35:31,672
No, that's not what I said.

762
00:35:31,673 --> 00:35:33,383
But that since this is a variety show,
it is okay to show that I'm scared.

763
00:35:33,384 --> 00:35:35,028
- Since this is my first time doing it.
- Of course.

764
00:35:35,029 --> 00:35:37,245
- No! You have to look cool.
- Really?

765
00:35:37,246 --> 00:35:38,968
You have to always look cool.

766
00:35:38,969 --> 00:35:40,710
Shall we get started?

767
00:35:40,711 --> 00:35:44,002
- He's scared right now.
- You can see his hesitation.

768
00:35:44,003 --> 00:35:46,332
- Okay, the human bullet is going to jump.
- Okay.

769
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,318
It would actually be weirder
if he wasn't scared.

770
00:35:48,319 --> 00:35:50,706
[First human bullet, Jang Woo Sung
is locked and loaded!]

771
00:35:51,402 --> 00:35:54,460
[The fear is only momentary...]

772
00:35:57,933 --> 00:36:01,458
[In this moment, I am free...]

773
00:36:16,564 --> 00:36:18,924
[Into the water?]

774
00:36:23,576 --> 00:36:26,811
[And in that crevice of all places?]

775
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:31,166
That was such a bad show.

776
00:36:31,167 --> 00:36:32,650
That was awful.

777
00:36:32,651 --> 00:36:34,000
He fell in the water!

778
00:36:34,001 --> 00:36:35,436
He fell in the water!

779
00:36:38,588 --> 00:36:40,772
- He fell in the water.
- That was hilarious.

780
00:36:41,005 --> 00:36:42,792
What are you doing, Woo Sung?

781
00:36:42,793 --> 00:36:45,943
[The power of the Blob Jump turns even
the coolest man in Korea into a comedian.]

782
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:51,459
[Instantly transforming him into someone who's
more like friend from your neighborhood.]

783
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:53,493
That's not at all the image I've seen of him
portrayed in his movies.

784
00:36:53,494 --> 00:36:55,816
I was shocked for a moment thinking
that you weren't wearing any pants.

785
00:36:57,859 --> 00:37:01,118
[Assuming his cool demeanor once again
no matter what the others are saying.]

786
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:03,420
Don't pretend to be cool now.

787
00:37:03,421 --> 00:37:05,587
It's already too late.
We've seen what you're really like.

788
00:37:07,242 --> 00:37:08,560
This is entertainment.

789
00:37:09,162 --> 00:37:11,100
- Is that what you call it?
- He's good.

790
00:37:11,101 --> 00:37:13,210
[Belatedly realizing how funny he can be.]

791
00:37:13,418 --> 00:37:15,544
- That's really high up.
- Woo Sung.

792
00:37:15,545 --> 00:37:18,402
- Don't you feel confident about it now?
- It's no longer scary, right?

793
00:37:18,929 --> 00:37:21,151
- Not scary, right? It's no big deal.
- Yes, you're right.

794
00:37:21,152 --> 00:37:23,005
But why did you fall in the water?

795
00:37:23,681 --> 00:37:26,166
There's a little gap between that thing.

796
00:37:26,348 --> 00:37:28,485
- There's a gap.
- Are you okay?

797
00:37:28,486 --> 00:37:30,672
They should've told us that
there's a gap.

798
00:37:31,305 --> 00:37:34,655
I'm sorry, but if you fall again,
we'll go after that.

799
00:37:34,656 --> 00:37:37,060
If you feel bad about saying it,
then don't say it at all.

800
00:37:37,061 --> 00:37:40,631
- We want to take our turn.
- Woo Sung's good at physical gags.

801
00:37:40,632 --> 00:37:43,112
[And it's twice as funny seeing someone who's
normally so cool doing funny gags.]

802
00:37:43,673 --> 00:37:46,699
If Woo Sung does it again this time,
you guys can take your turn.

803
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:47,778
Yes, okay.

804
00:37:48,941 --> 00:37:51,380
- You're no longer nervous, right?
- Yes, of course.

805
00:37:51,381 --> 00:37:54,565
[There was a deep meaning behind all this?
So that they'd shed their nervous energy?]

806
00:37:54,566 --> 00:37:57,555
- We really did shed our nervous energy.
- That was too funny.

807
00:37:57,956 --> 00:38:00,595
- That was too funny.
- This is your last chance.

808
00:38:00,596 --> 00:38:05,190
Of all the male guests we've had thus far,
he is the funniest with physical gags.

809
00:38:05,191 --> 00:38:07,541
[Funniest physical gags out of all the
male guests they've had so far.]

810
00:38:07,542 --> 00:38:08,796
Fighting!

811
00:38:08,797 --> 00:38:10,612
But I... no, okay.

812
00:38:11,778 --> 00:38:15,208
- If you have something to say, then say it.
- He lost his desire to speak.

813
00:38:15,209 --> 00:38:16,753
- Let him concentrate.
- Okay, here I go.

814
00:38:16,754 --> 00:38:18,581
[Woo Sung's second attempt at
becoming the human bullet.]

815
00:38:22,558 --> 00:38:24,829
[Again?]

816
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:37,128
[Two physical gags in a row.]

817
00:38:48,891 --> 00:38:52,495
Jung Woo Sung really is so funny.
Why is he just doing his first variety show?

818
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:55,440
Jung Woo Sung is the best of
all physical gag do-ers.

819
00:38:56,631 --> 00:39:00,816
[Even the national MC is impressed with
his ability to make others laugh.]

820
00:39:04,090 --> 00:39:05,723
You're hilarious!

821
00:39:06,488 --> 00:39:08,851
I can't believe how funny he is.

822
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:12,402
I keep wanting to make you guys laugh.

823
00:39:12,403 --> 00:39:13,782
What are you doing?

824
00:39:13,783 --> 00:39:17,388
[Even bigger laughs from his attempt
at trying to explain his reasoning.]

825
00:39:18,858 --> 00:39:23,594
[The ultimate actor, Jung Woo Sung...
And now, the ultimate bringer of laughter!]

826
00:39:24,181 --> 00:39:27,591
<i>Okay, we're going to start
doing this seriously now.</i>

827
00:39:27,592 --> 00:39:29,323
<i>Okay, Red Team's turn to go up.</i>

828
00:39:29,324 --> 00:39:31,836
- This isn't easy.
- I feel like I'm boarding a plane.

829
00:39:31,837 --> 00:39:33,948
[Coach Kkuk is the first jumper
for the Red Team.]

830
00:39:33,949 --> 00:39:36,199
- It doesn't look that high up from here.
- I know.

831
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:41,059
I know that people say that Running Man
is all about extreme games and sports...

832
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:45,148
But it's all about the eating games.
I ate all the watermelon, and now the water.

833
00:39:46,234 --> 00:39:48,428
- We're all about eating.
- Eating contests.

834
00:39:49,364 --> 00:39:51,894
- Fighting!
- Fighting!

835
00:39:51,895 --> 00:39:54,048
I can understand what
you were feeling now, Woo Sung.

836
00:39:55,133 --> 00:39:56,992
Jump further than you think you should.

837
00:39:58,494 --> 00:40:00,102
[Red Team's Coach Kkuk is
locked and loaded, and ready to go!]

838
00:40:02,366 --> 00:40:03,747
[Oh!]

839
00:40:07,622 --> 00:40:10,116
[Oh! He gets himself situated!]

840
00:40:10,573 --> 00:40:12,952
But isn't he... oh, okay.

841
00:40:12,953 --> 00:40:15,354
- Suk Jin, you fall for longer than you think.
- What?

842
00:40:15,355 --> 00:40:16,614
- Really?
- Yeah.

843
00:40:18,482 --> 00:40:20,472
- This is scary.
- This looks scary.

844
00:40:21,910 --> 00:40:24,930
- It's pretty high up there.
- You have to jump all at once.

845
00:40:24,931 --> 00:40:26,734
- Challenge.
- Challenge!

846
00:40:26,735 --> 00:40:28,759
[Will they be able to
jump together simultaneously?]

847
00:40:29,286 --> 00:40:30,831
- Let's go!
- Let's do this!

848
00:40:30,832 --> 00:40:32,694
- Fighting!
- Look straight ahead!

849
00:40:32,695 --> 00:40:36,233
One... two... three!

850
00:40:37,298 --> 00:40:38,359
Three!

851
00:40:40,977 --> 00:40:43,977
- Why are you jumping?
- Hey!

852
00:40:43,978 --> 00:40:45,669
Do it right!

853
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:48,688
- Do it right!
- Cheer us on, Hyo Joo!

854
00:40:48,689 --> 00:40:50,001
- Fighting!
- Fighting!

855
00:40:50,002 --> 00:40:51,578
- You can do this!
- Fighting!

856
00:40:52,386 --> 00:40:54,795
[Will they do it this time?]

857
00:40:56,085 --> 00:40:57,587
One, two, three!

858
00:41:00,119 --> 00:41:01,921
[There they go!]

859
00:41:18,948 --> 00:41:20,950
[A pretty high jump!]

860
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:25,815
[Coach Kkuk of the Red Team
succeeds at the Blob Jump!]

861
00:41:25,816 --> 00:41:27,738
- We did it!
- We did it!

862
00:41:33,582 --> 00:41:36,043
- Did you see that?
- That was a pretty good jump.

863
00:41:37,333 --> 00:41:38,713
It's fun!

864
00:41:39,354 --> 00:41:40,704
It's fun.

865
00:41:42,236 --> 00:41:46,070
- That wasn't so bad at all!
- That's how you do it.

866
00:41:46,572 --> 00:41:50,216
- That's how you do it.
- It really hurt my butt when we fell through.

867
00:41:50,217 --> 00:41:51,644
It really stung my hips.

868
00:41:51,645 --> 00:41:54,942
<i>Here's the record for Kim Jong Kook
and the Red Team.</i>

869
00:41:54,943 --> 00:41:58,502
<i>Kim Jong Kook's record is, 5m 70cm.</i>

870
00:41:58,503 --> 00:42:00,281
[Coach Kkuk of the Red Team's
Blob Jump record- 5m 70cm.]

871
00:42:12,652 --> 00:42:14,905
[Nice, Coach Kkuk!]

872
00:42:14,906 --> 00:42:18,006
- Nice, that was great.
- Hold hands when you jump.

873
00:42:18,007 --> 00:42:22,177
- Hold hands and stay close when you jump.
- Stick close together.

874
00:42:22,178 --> 00:42:25,455
Okay, we can take care of it ourselves.
We'll do it ourselves.

875
00:42:25,456 --> 00:42:27,196
- We can do this.
- You should listen and learn from us.

876
00:42:27,197 --> 00:42:29,812
But even if you teach this team a lesson,
they don't have me.

877
00:42:30,276 --> 00:42:32,767
But we have Jung Woo Sung.

878
00:42:32,768 --> 00:42:34,852
We're actually happier because
you're not on our team.

879
00:42:34,853 --> 00:42:38,698
[Blue Team's Jung Woo Sung
takes another attempt at the jump.]

880
00:42:39,242 --> 00:42:41,674
- Are you not scared anymore?
- It's not scary anymore.

881
00:42:41,675 --> 00:42:45,027
- It's only scary right before you jump.
- You flew so high up in the air.

882
00:42:45,028 --> 00:42:48,312
- This is really scary.
- This is no joke.

883
00:42:48,313 --> 00:42:49,929
- Should I go in the middle?
- Yeah, you go in the middle.

884
00:42:49,930 --> 00:42:51,709
Jung Woo Sung, fighting!

885
00:42:52,408 --> 00:42:54,302
- One, two...
- Then we land like this.

886
00:42:55,542 --> 00:42:57,596
- We're all set. We're going to win this.
- We're good.

887
00:42:57,597 --> 00:42:59,396
- You can trust us, Woo Sung.
- Okay.

888
00:42:59,397 --> 00:43:01,316
- Here I go.
- Okay. You can do it.

889
00:43:03,231 --> 00:43:05,844
- Stop worrying about us.
- This parts harder than you'd think.

890
00:43:05,845 --> 00:43:09,766
I'm even more concerned about
making the same mistake again.

891
00:43:09,767 --> 00:43:12,558
I'm more concerned about falling
through the cracks again.

892
00:43:12,953 --> 00:43:14,977
- I know.
- Show them how to do it.

893
00:43:14,978 --> 00:43:18,170
[What if I fall in the water again?]

894
00:43:18,171 --> 00:43:20,378
- They're going to think you're scared.
- It's not because I'm scared.

895
00:43:24,444 --> 00:43:26,544
- He did it.
- He did it this time.

896
00:43:26,545 --> 00:43:28,186
[He does it this time!]

897
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:30,879
- Nice job, Woo Sung!
- You're so happy about it!

898
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:34,871
I've succeeded my mission now.
Am I finished?

899
00:43:35,689 --> 00:43:38,341
- No? Do I need to go up further?
- You have to go up to the front.

900
00:43:38,342 --> 00:43:41,468
You have to go up
to the front point of the tube.

901
00:43:43,330 --> 00:43:46,950
- Don't be scared and jump, okay?
- But you looked scared right now.

902
00:43:46,951 --> 00:43:49,609
- No, I'm okay to jump.
- Look at him.

903
00:43:49,610 --> 00:43:52,161
- The three scaredy cats are up there.
- This is going to be fun.

904
00:43:52,162 --> 00:43:53,681
[Will they be able to jump?]

905
00:43:53,682 --> 00:43:55,565
This is funny.
This is way fun.

906
00:43:55,566 --> 00:43:58,263
Trust in each other
and jump on the count of three.

907
00:43:58,263 --> 00:44:00,363
[That's easier said than done...]

908
00:44:00,364 --> 00:44:01,898
Okay, I'm ready.

909
00:44:02,656 --> 00:44:04,718
Let's all do this with our legs.

910
00:44:04,719 --> 00:44:06,978
[None of the three look like
they want to jump on the tube.]

911
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:10,724
- Woo Sung, are you ready?
- I'm ready!

912
00:44:11,688 --> 00:44:14,194
[Moments before Jung Woo Sung's
first Blob Jump!]

913
00:44:14,455 --> 00:44:17,232
- Two...
- Let us count.

914
00:44:17,233 --> 00:44:19,077
It's up to us to count.
You can't count for us.

915
00:44:19,078 --> 00:44:20,881
- Don't be scared.
- We'll do it.

916
00:44:21,683 --> 00:44:24,754
- We can't get scared.
- We have to do this for the jump.

917
00:44:24,755 --> 00:44:25,956
- This is fun!
- Let's do this quickly.

918
00:44:25,957 --> 00:44:28,224
[Pathetic...]

919
00:44:29,793 --> 00:44:32,011
Hurry up and jump!

920
00:44:32,012 --> 00:44:34,178
- All together.
- Set, go.

921
00:44:34,179 --> 00:44:36,545
One, two, three!

922
00:44:41,210 --> 00:44:43,084
[Jump]

923
00:44:51,770 --> 00:44:53,276
There you go!

924
00:44:57,258 --> 00:45:01,292
[Jung Woo Sung's blob jump... Success!]

925
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:05,570
[Even though he's flailing around
in the air...]

926
00:45:05,571 --> 00:45:07,394
[He falls into the water with flair!]

927
00:45:10,628 --> 00:45:13,993
- We did it.
- That was a nice job done.

928
00:45:13,994 --> 00:45:15,938
[Satisfied]

929
00:45:16,395 --> 00:45:19,150
- He didn't fly up too high.
- No, that wasn't very high up.

930
00:45:19,151 --> 00:45:21,779
[What's the record for
Blue Team's Woo Sung?]

931
00:45:22,786 --> 00:45:27,258
[Woo Sung finally succeeds
on his third attempt.]

932
00:45:27,575 --> 00:45:29,731
- No, you did get some height.
- Is it fun?

933
00:45:29,732 --> 00:45:33,952
It really is fun. But I wanted to turn my
body but I couldn't get it to do that.

934
00:45:33,953 --> 00:45:35,791
Good, that was a good job.

935
00:45:36,237 --> 00:45:40,091
[The highest record thus far is
Jong Kook's at 5m 70cm.]

936
00:45:40,092 --> 00:45:42,568
- Blue Team's is, 5m...
- Is it more than 5m?

937
00:45:42,569 --> 00:45:48,074
[Woo Sung of the Blue Team's record...
5m... 10cm.]

938
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:01,169
- Okay, we did it.
- You were off sync and fell after us.

939
00:46:01,687 --> 00:46:05,186
- I think a lighter person needs to do it.
- It's all about the weight.

940
00:46:05,187 --> 00:46:09,614
We're warning you right now,
we're going to beat our previous record.

941
00:46:09,615 --> 00:46:11,984
Junho is going to take the challenge
and be the jumper this time.

942
00:46:11,985 --> 00:46:13,899
Junho's already jumping?
He's the ace of that team.

943
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:16,272
Are we supposed to be scared
of that warning right now?

944
00:46:16,273 --> 00:46:17,426
At least be nervous about it.

945
00:46:17,427 --> 00:46:19,049
- You're not scared?
- No, I'm not scared.

946
00:46:22,104 --> 00:46:24,180
I think jumping together in sync is
the most important thing.

947
00:46:24,215 --> 00:46:26,126
[As predicted, the most important thing is
for the three back jumpers to be in sync.]

948
00:46:26,127 --> 00:46:28,463
Do you know what you guys looked like?

949
00:46:28,464 --> 00:46:31,796
Instead of you guys hearing each other,
you all had the same blank look on your face.

950
00:46:31,797 --> 00:46:34,062
- Like this.
- We were all thinking about something else.

951
00:46:34,063 --> 00:46:35,836
Yeah, we were thinking about
something else.

952
00:46:35,837 --> 00:46:37,526
But it really is scary up there.

953
00:46:37,527 --> 00:46:39,850
You have to break all the records.
You're our ace.

954
00:46:39,851 --> 00:46:41,950
[Second jumper for the Red Team- Junho!]

955
00:46:41,951 --> 00:46:43,694
- Let's fly!
- Make it so they can't even attempt it.

956
00:46:43,695 --> 00:46:45,986
- Be quick like we were!
- Can I go now?

957
00:46:45,987 --> 00:46:48,054
It's not as easy as it looks.

958
00:46:51,529 --> 00:46:54,640
[Jumps without any hesitation
and falls on the tube safely.]

959
00:46:54,641 --> 00:46:56,426
- That's our ace!
- He's our ace!

960
00:46:56,427 --> 00:46:58,494
- That's good.
- You're going to get the best record.

961
00:46:59,346 --> 00:47:00,684
This is tough.

962
00:47:01,665 --> 00:47:05,117
Even though our record may be low,
no one can be funnier than us!

963
00:47:05,806 --> 00:47:08,610
[No one can even come close.]

964
00:47:09,485 --> 00:47:11,634
And not just once, but twice!

965
00:47:12,864 --> 00:47:14,995
- Kick up your leg and lean on your back.
- Jump at once?

966
00:47:14,996 --> 00:47:17,508
- Lay on your back or stare out front?
- You have to stare out front.

967
00:47:17,509 --> 00:47:19,556
[Why are they talking so much
when all they need to do is jump?]

968
00:47:19,862 --> 00:47:21,425
Okay, ready?

969
00:47:22,166 --> 00:47:24,211
- Okay, ready?
- Jump on three.

970
00:47:24,212 --> 00:47:25,935
- Am I good to trust you?
- Here we go!

971
00:47:25,936 --> 00:47:28,228
This is fun!
This is really enjoyable!

972
00:47:28,617 --> 00:47:30,431
- Okay, I'll do it.
- No hesitating, okay?

973
00:47:30,432 --> 00:47:32,428
- We have to jump, okay?
- Jump all at once.

974
00:47:32,429 --> 00:47:35,336
Here we go!
One, two, three!

975
00:47:35,337 --> 00:47:38,009
[Look straight ahead... and jump!]

976
00:47:48,149 --> 00:47:49,664
We're going to lose.

977
00:47:53,244 --> 00:47:57,386
[This is...
what you call acrobatic diving.]

978
00:48:03,068 --> 00:48:06,493
[Junho of the Red Team succeeds
the blob jump with flair!]

979
00:48:10,566 --> 00:48:12,166
How did it turn out?

980
00:48:12,167 --> 00:48:13,872
- Was it good?
- That was awesome!

981
00:48:15,574 --> 00:48:17,481
- That was great!
- The Red Team's record...

982
00:48:17,949 --> 00:48:21,784
The record is, 6m 36cm.

983
00:48:33,902 --> 00:48:36,388
- How was it, Hyo Joo!
- You guys were so cool!

984
00:48:37,046 --> 00:48:40,900
- Why are you looking at us like that?
- What's with the expression, Ji Hyo?

985
00:48:40,901 --> 00:48:42,790
- We can do better.
- Trust us.

986
00:48:42,791 --> 00:48:45,892
- Woo Sung's going to be in the middle now.
- Don't you worry!

987
00:48:45,893 --> 00:48:48,182
- I'll do it this time.
- That was so cool.

988
00:48:48,424 --> 00:48:52,924
I really wasn't thinking of anything,
but when I was lifted up into the air...

989
00:48:52,925 --> 00:48:55,240
- When that happened, my mind went blank.
- Really?

990
00:48:55,241 --> 00:48:58,884
- How does it feel up in the air?
- You have your legs spread apart in the air

991
00:48:58,885 --> 00:49:02,359
so when you're up there, your body is flailing
and you're unable to control your body.

992
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:06,872
Is there a need for us to dissect
and pull it apart detail by detail like this?

993
00:49:06,873 --> 00:49:09,257
- I'm just telling you how it is.
- Lets just be happy about it.

994
00:49:09,258 --> 00:49:10,816
Let's just enjoy this moment.

995
00:49:11,548 --> 00:49:14,589
[Second jumper for the Red Team-
Yoo Jae Suk.]

996
00:49:16,688 --> 00:49:22,154
[Hates anything up high,
and hates jumping off of it even more!]

997
00:49:22,155 --> 00:49:25,180
[But I still have to jump!]

998
00:49:25,181 --> 00:49:27,457
Keep your eyes straight ahead!

999
00:49:28,437 --> 00:49:29,612
Okay, here I go!

1000
00:49:38,230 --> 00:49:42,566
[After a nice fall... kerplunk.]

1001
00:49:42,567 --> 00:49:46,273
[No one beats this guy
in the comedy department...]

1002
00:49:48,348 --> 00:49:50,435
- But I had a nice fall!
- That was too funny.

1003
00:49:50,436 --> 00:49:53,678
[Seeing him trying so hard not to fall
in the water is even funnier.]

1004
00:49:54,814 --> 00:49:56,773
- Did you hear him while he was falling?
- Hey!

1005
00:49:56,774 --> 00:49:59,009
I'm going to have to do that again!

1006
00:49:59,583 --> 00:50:02,663
Once that happens,
that's all you're concerned about.

1007
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:08,535
This is driving me nuts.

1008
00:50:11,709 --> 00:50:13,162
I can't believe that happened.

1009
00:50:13,554 --> 00:50:16,286
- Jung Woo Sung had to do it twice.
- You have to jump towards the middle.

1010
00:50:16,287 --> 00:50:18,199
- How did I jump?
- I'm not sure either.

1011
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:20,859
- You can't let Woo Sung beat you.
- You know what the important thing is?

1012
00:50:20,860 --> 00:50:23,652
I bet Woo Sung's feeling much better
about himself right now.

1013
00:50:23,653 --> 00:50:26,924
[Junior in the gag reel department
feeling slightly better now.]

1014
00:50:26,925 --> 00:50:28,689
Now that someone else besides
himself did what he did.

1015
00:50:28,690 --> 00:50:30,931
That is really tiring though.
Okay, here I go again.

1016
00:50:31,801 --> 00:50:33,992
[Jae Suk, locked and loaded!]

1017
00:50:39,409 --> 00:50:42,053
[Smack dab in the middle this time.]

1018
00:50:42,054 --> 00:50:43,412
Ugh, that was scary.

1019
00:50:43,413 --> 00:50:45,439
I seriously feel like I'm going to die.

1020
00:50:46,626 --> 00:50:49,809
It's simple. Land on your butt.
It won't hurt on your butt.

1021
00:50:50,575 --> 00:50:53,478
[It's time for the three to jump again.]

1022
00:50:53,479 --> 00:50:55,910
- Set your right foot over here.
- Fighting!

1023
00:50:55,911 --> 00:50:59,632
- Okay.
- Okay, one, two, three.

1024
00:51:12,572 --> 00:51:13,864
There you go!

1025
00:51:19,786 --> 00:51:21,037
Awesome!

1026
00:51:21,567 --> 00:51:23,078
Awesome!

1027
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:26,334
Wow, that was good!

1028
00:51:27,088 --> 00:51:30,554
[Flying... straight up in the air!]

1029
00:51:30,555 --> 00:51:32,208
That was awesome!

1030
00:51:32,487 --> 00:51:35,619
[Even at a quick glance,
it's sure to be a great record!]

1031
00:51:35,620 --> 00:51:37,016
You did it!

1032
00:51:38,455 --> 00:51:40,308
- That was good.
- That was higher than mine?

1033
00:51:42,365 --> 00:51:45,310
[My goodness... Jae Suk did that?]

1034
00:51:45,817 --> 00:51:47,672
<i>The Blue Team's record is...</i>

1035
00:51:49,125 --> 00:51:51,396
<i>7m 28cm.</i>

1036
00:51:51,397 --> 00:51:55,680
[Jae Suk of the Blue Team's record is-
7m 28cm!]

1037
00:52:04,975 --> 00:52:06,254
Awesome!

1038
00:52:08,222 --> 00:52:11,434
[The welcome party?]

1039
00:52:11,435 --> 00:52:14,813
I saw him screaming in terror as he was
lifted up into the air.

1040
00:52:14,814 --> 00:52:18,446
[Flailing as a grasshopper would
leaping through the air.]

1041
00:52:18,447 --> 00:52:21,698
But it wasn't as bad as I thought.
Up to this point.

1042
00:52:22,050 --> 00:52:25,862
- To where?
- You have to keep your head up not to turn.

1043
00:52:25,863 --> 00:52:28,909
Relax your body, sit up
and don't be tense about it.

1044
00:52:28,910 --> 00:52:30,574
- Okay.
- So you're listening to me now?

1045
00:52:31,756 --> 00:52:34,507
- Listen to me, and I'll tell you about it.
- I don't think he's right for it.

1046
00:52:34,508 --> 00:52:36,935
Woo Sung was a better jumper.

1047
00:52:36,936 --> 00:52:38,733
You have to relax your body
and don't be tense.

1048
00:52:39,589 --> 00:52:43,095
[But they were just saying the three jumpers
in the back did a good job...]

1049
00:52:43,096 --> 00:52:44,915
Listen to me after you listen
to Woo Sung.

1050
00:52:44,916 --> 00:52:48,171
- Listen and learn!
- You weigh a lot, right, Woo Sung?

1051
00:52:48,172 --> 00:52:50,811
No, no.
This is all about being in sync.

1052
00:52:50,812 --> 00:52:52,191
- How much do you weigh?
- You have to be in sync.

1053
00:52:52,192 --> 00:52:54,466
- Just tell us how much you weigh.
- Why, how much do you weigh?

1054
00:52:54,467 --> 00:52:57,323
- How much do you think I weigh?
- 85 kg?

1055
00:52:57,324 --> 00:53:00,127
- Are we going to do this or not?
- I weigh 80kg.

1056
00:53:00,128 --> 00:53:02,477
- 80?
- Don't lie to us.

1057
00:53:02,478 --> 00:53:04,446
- But I weigh 78kg.
- I'm serious.

1058
00:53:04,447 --> 00:53:06,381
- Why did you get so fat? Lose some weight.
- What did you say?

1059
00:53:06,382 --> 00:53:09,314
- How am I heavy?
- How much do you all weigh?

1060
00:53:09,315 --> 00:53:11,289
- Lose some weight!
- I weigh 78kg.

1061
00:53:11,290 --> 00:53:14,336
- That's not too heavy.
- We did a good job with our jump.

1062
00:53:14,337 --> 00:53:16,063
- Yeah, you did really good.
- I got that feeling.

1063
00:53:16,421 --> 00:53:19,779
- Why are you standing like that?
- I'm just hanging my fingers.

1064
00:53:21,332 --> 00:53:22,971
Because it's comfortable?

1065
00:53:23,350 --> 00:53:24,861
Because it's comfortable?

1066
00:53:24,862 --> 00:53:28,139
[What's wrong with you...]

1067
00:53:28,140 --> 00:53:30,369
- What's wrong with you?
- Is it your first time?

1068
00:53:30,370 --> 00:53:31,694
Just pretend you didn't see that.

1069
00:53:32,507 --> 00:53:33,595
Like we didn't see it?

1070
00:53:33,992 --> 00:53:39,443
[Current highest record-
Jae Suk of the Blue Team's 7m 28cm.]

1071
00:53:40,655 --> 00:53:46,342
[Blue Team's final jumper is Ace Ji Hyo!]

1072
00:53:47,118 --> 00:53:48,230
There you go!

1073
00:53:51,145 --> 00:53:53,258
- You're doing good.
- Did you see her do that?

1074
00:53:53,979 --> 00:53:55,712
That's how you do it, Hyo Joo.

1075
00:53:55,713 --> 00:54:00,241
[The three back jumpers are-
Woo Sung, Jae Suk and Ha Ha.]

1076
00:54:00,242 --> 00:54:02,231
We need to do it quickly
once Ji Hyo is ready.

1077
00:54:02,232 --> 00:54:04,371
Let's see what you can do, Song Ji Hyo!

1078
00:54:05,272 --> 00:54:08,446
[We'll help Ace Ji Hyo fly into the air!]

1079
00:54:09,224 --> 00:54:10,590
- Okay, here we go.
- Okay!

1080
00:54:11,466 --> 00:54:13,467
[Here we go!]

1081
00:54:22,657 --> 00:54:25,391
[Ji Hyo is airborne!]

1082
00:54:32,703 --> 00:54:34,877
[Unbelievable height!]

1083
00:54:38,455 --> 00:54:43,257
[Even though it's just for a little while,
it's like flying through the air!]

1084
00:54:49,270 --> 00:54:50,892
How was Ji Hyo?

1085
00:54:53,959 --> 00:54:56,674
[Our fearless ace!]

1086
00:54:56,675 --> 00:54:59,466
[Totally psyched up!]

1087
00:54:59,467 --> 00:55:00,953
- That was so much fun!
- Are you okay, Ji Hyo?

1088
00:55:00,954 --> 00:55:02,797
- It's fun?
- She says that was fun!

1089
00:55:02,798 --> 00:55:06,174
- That was no joke!
- I bet she got at least 9m!

1090
00:55:06,175 --> 00:55:07,858
I feel like she got 10m on that.

1091
00:55:07,859 --> 00:55:10,532
[She's not our ace for nothing!]

1092
00:55:12,423 --> 00:55:17,782
[Blue Team's mood is definitely uplifted!]

1093
00:55:17,783 --> 00:55:19,896
- Ji Hyo, you're the best!
- That was awesome!

1094
00:55:19,897 --> 00:55:21,398
Okay, the record is...

1095
00:55:21,399 --> 00:55:23,185
She scored the highest record.

1096
00:55:23,186 --> 00:55:26,134
- Yes!
- 7m 86cm!

1097
00:55:26,135 --> 00:55:30,080
[Ace Ji Hyo of the Blue Team's record-
7m 86cm!]

1098
00:55:30,081 --> 00:55:31,497
That was awesome.

1099
00:55:40,227 --> 00:55:41,517
What happened to Ji Hyo?

1100
00:55:42,367 --> 00:55:45,417
Woo Sung was very good to lead.

1101
00:55:45,418 --> 00:55:48,148
- No, it was all teamwork.
- When I was up in the air...

1102
00:55:48,149 --> 00:55:50,946
When I saw the water below me...
that was amazing!

1103
00:55:50,947 --> 00:55:53,924
That was so much fun.
I could see all the water beneath me.

1104
00:55:53,925 --> 00:55:58,089
[This may have to become Running Man's
new repertoire for our Blank Ji.]

1105
00:55:58,090 --> 00:55:59,722
I saw her face when she
was up in the air.

1106
00:55:59,723 --> 00:56:02,121
She had the biggest grin on her face.

1107
00:56:02,122 --> 00:56:04,516
[Ace Ji Hyo with a huge grin on her face
in the middle of the air.]

1108
00:56:05,307 --> 00:56:07,677
But my butt really hurts right now.

1109
00:56:08,069 --> 00:56:09,897
Your butt hurts?
Let me see.

1110
00:56:11,133 --> 00:56:12,914
I guess I can't do anything for her.

1111
00:56:12,915 --> 00:56:15,266
That was the most fun ever.

1112
00:56:15,267 --> 00:56:18,843
The Red Team has to beat their record of
7m 86cm.

1113
00:56:18,844 --> 00:56:21,474
I think Hyo Joo is going to fly really high.

1114
00:56:21,475 --> 00:56:23,902
If you beat this,
your next movie is going to be a hit.

1115
00:56:23,903 --> 00:56:24,996
Challenge!

1116
00:56:26,283 --> 00:56:29,280
- Challenge!
- I can't believe how that got her.

1117
00:56:29,281 --> 00:56:31,892
[Will Hyo Joo of the Red Team be able to
beat the record of 7m 86cm?]

1118
00:56:32,288 --> 00:56:37,083
[Hyo Joo following Ji Hyo's method.]

1119
00:56:37,084 --> 00:56:38,939
- You're doing great!
- That was good, Hyo Joo.

1120
00:56:42,941 --> 00:56:44,737
Let's break the 8m record.

1121
00:56:45,363 --> 00:56:47,728
Hyo Joo.... fighting!
Let's win this thing.

1122
00:56:47,729 --> 00:56:49,100
8m, okay?

1123
00:56:49,101 --> 00:56:51,166
There's nothing to this, guys.

1124
00:56:51,167 --> 00:56:53,843
Let's practice our timing.
One, two, three.

1125
00:56:53,844 --> 00:56:56,243
Okay?
Just keep your eyes straight ahead.

1126
00:56:56,244 --> 00:56:57,394
Okay?

1127
00:56:57,395 --> 00:57:00,229
Hyo Joo!
Look up into the sky.

1128
00:57:00,789 --> 00:57:03,859
[Sky...]

1129
00:57:05,095 --> 00:57:06,427
Hey, Han Hyo Joo!

1130
00:57:07,557 --> 00:57:09,035
What are you doing?

1131
00:57:10,184 --> 00:57:12,363
- I think she's scared.
- No, she's just ready for you guys.

1132
00:57:12,364 --> 00:57:13,883
Okay, here we go!

1133

- Let's go for a round.
- No, Kwang Soo.

1530
01:18:40,624 --> 01:18:42,516
- You're too far out. Step back quickly.
- Really?

1531
01:18:42,517 --> 01:18:43,704
You're too far out.

1532

is already in our possession.

Are you rice?

1540
01:19:11,654 --> 01:19:14,111
- Why do you assume that I'm the rice?
- Look at how angry you are.

1541

is to verbally attack...]

1552

- Ugh!
- This isn't going to work.

1558
01:20:05,029 --> 01:20:06,511
You hit me twice!

1559
01:20:07,781 --> 01:20:10,103
- I saw you gripping your fist.
- No, you didn't!

1560
01:20:10,104 --> 01:20:11,547
You're shorter than me!

1561

however you'd like except for the picnic mat.

1603

So except for the picnic mat?

1604
01:23:25,537 --> 01:23:28,427
Why don't you give it to Ji Hyo and Gary
for the wedding dowry?

1605
01:23:28,428 --> 01:23:30,749
- Really?
- That's a great idea.

As for me...
I'd like Hyo Joo's espresso machine.

- You're saying you want it for yourself?
- Yes.

- Take the TV.
- In that case...

- But before Park Ji Sung comes out...
- Is she coming?
