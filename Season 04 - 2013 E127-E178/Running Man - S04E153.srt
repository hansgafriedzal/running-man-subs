Why don't you send her a video message?

46
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:33,010
I will run with everything I have
for the special woman in my life.

[Congratulations, Captain Park.]

56

Thank you.

Please take good care of me.

60
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:16,780
I doubt he even notices that
she's standing there right now.

61
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:20,730
No matter who's standing next to him
right now, he's not going to notice anyone.

62
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:24,180
I'm sure there's just one person
that he's missing right now.

63
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:27,460
- This is so Ji Sung.
- You went out for chicken last night, right?

64
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:32,350
Yes, it was delicious.

65
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,920
Have you been watching our show
lately at all, Ji Sung?

66
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,960
Yes, I haven't missed a single episode.

67
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:43,460
Any episode that really stuck with you?

68
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:45,920
Any episode that you found to be
especially entertaining?

69
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,460
- Something from the past year?
- It could be one of the earlier ones too.

70
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:51,800
- It could be any of the episodes.
- None was as funny as the one I was in.

71
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,040
None was as funny as the
one that I was in.

72
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:59,180
- Wow... that was awesome.
- Why didn't I think of that myself?

73
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:02,540
[One step above Running Man.]

74
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,260
<i>As you may already all know</i>

75
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:09,760
<i>the reason why we're
all together again this year is...</i>

76
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:13,450
<i>the Asian Dreamcup will be taking place
in Shanghai.</i>

77
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:15,710
It's the dream of all soccer games.

78
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:18,280
Then will we be participating in
the soccer game again this year?

79
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:21,070
<i>That's why all of you
are gathered here today.</i>

80
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:23,010
I bet we'll be playing to determine
who'll be playing in the game.

81
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:26,640
- I really want to play in the game.
- I want to stand in the lineup.

82
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:30,050
- I can do this.
- You have no idea how fast I can be.

83
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:33,620
<i>That's why we have prepared something.
Why don't we all take a look?</i>

Let's all take a look.

85
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,770
I really hope it's not
the clip from last year.

86
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:41,670
[Of course, it is!]

87
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,150

It was just way too fast!

93

[Refusing any interviews after the game.]

97
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:23,640
- Now that we're watching that...
- He didn't have the basics.

98
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:26,010
I had no idea that he'd be
that pathetic.

99
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:29,600
- Is it Kim Jong Kook now?
- That's when I first went on the field.

100

[The captain grabbing
and shaking him by the neck.]

104
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:55,970
- That was so pathetic.
- I couldn't not grab him at that time.

105
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,980
He lost such a great chance.

106

- I was left alone on my own!
- What were you doing out there?

109
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:12,350
I was just trying to help out
and make a heel pass.

110
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:15,420
It was just a simple mistake.
I normally don't play like that.

111
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:18,500
- Just do a good job with a regular pass.
- His conceit is through the roof.

112
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:21,040
What happened to him?
He's gotten so mean!

113
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,360
- Why has he gotten so mean?
- You're right on with that analysis.

114
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,560
What's wrong with you?

115
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:27,170
Skill wise, I expected the
most from him...

116
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,280
but he wasn't really
mentally prepared.

117
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:33,520
[Is he telling him to get
his head on straight?]

118

When did you get so mean?

119

- Is this the C-rank?

- That was such a smart choice!

130
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:15,910
Suk Jin, you've ultimately
been left abandoned.

131
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,070
<i>Okay, pick one person from
the B-rank.</i>

132
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,590
- What are you doing?
- I want to show him my toenails.

133
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:23,420
That's because he's always wearing
shoes that are too small for him.

134
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:25,840
Okay, thanks for showing me your toenails.

135

[Just put your socks back on.]

137

It's because women step on you with
their heels when you're out at the club.

138
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:41,890
- It's because you get stepped on.
- Now, pick someone from the A-rank.

139
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:44,200
- You two should close your eyes.
- I know he'll pick me.

Maybe we should think
about that again.

- We'll be fine.

- He's good.
- He's good at ripping that off.

249

it doesn't rip off as easily.

Hey, Ja Chul...

327
00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:31,980
Gu Ja Chul and Kim Jong Kook are
the big black holes of that team.

328
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:34,390
If it wasn't for Gu Ja Chul or Kim Jong Kook,
they'd win the game.

329
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:38,140
Just because it's you, Ja Chul...
don't think that you won't get swapped out.

330
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:41,950
[Team Gu Ja Chul- 0
Team Park Ji Sung- 5]

331

[With the game totally leaning towards
Team Park Ji Sung's win...]

332

Come on, Ja Chul!

333
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:48,160
[The team continues to toss their ball
towards the middleman, Ja Chul.]

334
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:55,130
[Again...]

335
00:18:56,930 --> 00:18:58,430
- Ja Chul!
- You okay?

336
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:01,050
What?
What!

337
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:02,470
- What!
- Are you okay?

338
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:05,110
- One more time.
- Let's do it one more time.

339
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:07,910
- What are you doing?
- Let's do that one more time.

340
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:09,740
One more time.
Let's do that one more time.

[Team Gu Ja Chul- 0
Team Park Ji Sung- 6]

343
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:22,580
[He makes a good pass over the net,
but Yoo Hyuk blocks the ball!]

344
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:28,700
[Ji Sung gets his chance.]

345
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:33,500
[Succeeds with a spike!]

346
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:36,130
[Scores with the chance that he's given!]

347
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:42,630
If you spike the ball on your first try...
what does that make me?

348
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:47,080
[That's what you call
the power of experience.]

349
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:51,860
[Team Gu Ja Chul's scores three points-
Team Gu Ja Chul- 3: Team Park Ji Sung- 7]

350

- It's okay. Take it easy.
- You can pass it over.

351
00:19:54,170 --> 00:19:56,140
[Huh?]

352
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:59,750
[Captain Gu having been kicked off
to the cheerleading team?]

353
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:03,950
- Nice!
- There you go!

[Sulli's super receive.]

359

- There you go!
- Mine!

[Bitter...]

364
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:37,140
We're doing so much better without you
in the game, Ja Chul.

365
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:38,420
I don't know what's
really going on here.

366
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:40,890
- Things are going so much better now.
- Ja Chul...

367
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:43,940
The score is going up and up without
Ja Chul in the game now.

368
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:45,710
Fighting, fighting!

[Annoyed Captain Gu going over to
cheer on the opposing team?]

370

Ja Chul is really good playing
that symbol though.

371
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:53,490
- No kidding.
- Maybe he should've gone into music instead.

372
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:55,220
Yeah, maybe he should've gone into music.

373
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:58,790
Okay, come in the game.
Trade Sulli out, and put Gary in.

[Team Gu Ja Chul-
Ja Chul finally back in the game.]

Nice!

of the net with a slight head hit.]

[High up into the air!]

390

I'm so nervous.

429
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:42,320
Deuce.

430
00:24:42,330 --> 00:24:46,580
Wow, this is really
nerve wrecking.

431
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:49,890
- There you go.
- Take it easy.

432
00:24:50,610 --> 00:24:55,230
[Because the game is at a deuce,
there must be a two point score for a win.]

Okay, this is it.

434
00:25:01,150 --> 00:25:03,170

- He said he'll get it.
- He'll get the ball.

438

[With no one in the middle to
catch the ball!]

444

and catch this pass.

- No, that wasn't it.

452

- Who were you bowing down to?
- I thought Suk Jin was in the way.

['Kim-leave it' greeting is catching on
to become the new way of greeting people.]

No one else was stepping up to get the ball.
Let's just swap for now.

455

- It was because the sun was in our eyes.
- That's right. It was because of the sun.

[Team Park Ji Sung wins the first set!]

457

I'll give you one minute
to plan your strategy.

00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:21,410
- Good job, Sulli.
- But I didn't even do anything.

459
00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:22,600
No, you did great.

460
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:25,860
[Captain Gu, who's gotten the feel for it
is strategizing the game for his team.]

461
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:28,240
- Over this way?
- Yes, this way. Then I'll take care of it.

462

[His plan is to take care of all
the scoring for the team.]

that you've made?]

of cold water to her teammates.]

465

- This is the last round.
- Get away!

466
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:39,580
What are you doing here?

467
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:43,760
Since Jong Kook is left footed,
we have to kick over to his left.

468
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,020
[Attack to his left!]

469
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:48,690
- This is a great strategy.
- Avoid passing it to the right.

470
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:51,360
- This is what you call strategizing.
- That's right!

471
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:56,440
This is what you call strategy.
Figuring out their lefts and rights.

472
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:59,470
They haven't figured out yet that
we're going easy on them, have they?

473
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:01,230
No, they haven't noticed.
- That's a relief.

474
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:04,300
Do you think they've noticed that
we've been going easy on them?

475
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:06,470
- No, they haven't.
- Of course not.

476

[Captain Gu acting as shameless
as the other team.]

477
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:11,440
You're quite sneaky.

478
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:16,020
- He's quite sneaky.
- Didn't you know his nickname is Sneaky Gu?

479
00:27:17,450 --> 00:27:20,780
The current set score is one to one.
This is the final winning set.

480
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:25,530
- Who's serve is it?
- Tell them to do it.

481
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:28,700
- We'll take the serve.
- Tell them to take the serve.

482

[Team Gu Ja Chul's serve
starts the final set.]

483

Gu Ja Chul, fighting!

484
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:38,590
Nice, nice... we got it!

485

[Yoo Hyuk, the attacker scores a point!]

486
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:46,770
I'm so sorry!

487
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:51,520
[Due to the popularity of 'Kim-leave it',
the court is full of mannerly players.]

00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:16,040
She came on as
the announcer for that episode.

659
00:38:16,050 --> 00:38:19,060
This is the first time I realized how much
fun foot volleyball could be.

660
00:38:19,070 --> 00:38:21,480
His competitiveness is no joke.
He's really competitive.

661
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:24,860
- Jong Kook is the most competitive of us all.
- It's not really that.

662
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:27,300
He's being nicer to you and not scolding you
because it's your first time on the show.

663
00:38:27,310 --> 00:38:28,590
No, I'm usually nice.

664
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:32,300
Ja Chul, were you really angry when you
were screaming 'Why' in his face?

665
00:38:32,430 --> 00:38:34,730
I forgot what was going on then.
What happened again?

666
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:40,260
That actually stemmed from the 2011 match
that Ji Sung played in.

667
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:45,780
Remember when Ji Sung scored in Saitama
and asked everyone to stay silent?

668
00:38:48,490 --> 00:38:53,810
[Staring at the Japanese audience in silent
mutiny for their hostile jeering and hissing.]

669
00:38:53,810 --> 00:38:58,560
[That day's ceremony was testimony of
Korea's dignity.]

670
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:03,850
During the first half of the game,
Ji Sung was facing off with Nagatomo

671
00:39:03,850 --> 00:39:07,130
and Nagatomo stole Ji Sung's
ball away from him.

672
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:12,070
And even after Ji Sung fell down, he chased
after him and tackled down the ball.

673
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:19,190
[Tenacious Ji Sung chases him down to the end
to tackle him down for his ball.]

674
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:22,290
And when he chased behind to tackle
the ball like that

675
00:39:22,290 --> 00:39:23,780
I was actually sitting out
on the bench at the time.

676
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:25,310
And when I saw the expression
that he had on his face...

677
00:39:25,310 --> 00:39:28,830
I thought to myself,
'Wow... that person really is amazing.'

678
00:39:28,830 --> 00:39:33,220
[Surge of emotion and respect when he saw
Ji Sung's expression on his face.]

679
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:35,860
I was in a game last year against Japan
where a player stole the ball away from me...

680
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:38,980
and as I fell down from his attack,
I felt so insulted and humiliated.

681
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:44,060
And I was suddenly reminded of Ji Sung,
and thought to myself, 'You're dead'.

682
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:51,440
[Just like he did two years ago...]

683
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:55,740
[I'll run just as hard!]

684
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:59,790
[I'm Park Ji Sung's junior!]

685
00:39:59,790 --> 00:40:03,850
When you're on the same team...
you feel like you're all part of the family.

686
00:40:03,850 --> 00:40:05,490
Especially since you look
upon him like your older brother.

687
00:40:05,490 --> 00:40:08,610
[Thus the place these two honorable
Captains have arrived at is?]

688
00:40:10,770 --> 00:40:13,110
[A lunch table?]

689
00:40:15,950 --> 00:40:17,060
We get to eat?

690
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:20,380
[Unexpected lunch time.]

691
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:21,540
We can eat?

692
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:24,070
Relax and enjoy your meal while
conversing with one another.

693
00:40:24,070 --> 00:40:25,660
What's going on here?

694
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:27,520
I know that you wouldn't
just be feeding us.

695
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:29,620
I know something has to be up.

696
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:32,210
[Everyone's suspicious of
the offered lunch.]

697
00:40:32,210 --> 00:40:34,650
- Wow... this looks so good.
- Enjoy your lunch, Ja Chul.

698
00:40:34,650 --> 00:40:37,560
- Yes, please enjoy your lunch.
- We won the game all thanks to you.

699
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:41,180
Remember the show with
IU last year?

700
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:42,220
- Sulli!
- Yes?

701
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:43,890
Is there anything that you want?

702
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:46,810
- Something I want?
- Yeah. Jae Suk likes to give out gifts.

703
00:40:46,810 --> 00:40:48,990
- Ah... a car!
- A car?

704
00:40:49,490 --> 00:40:51,280
- Jae Suk!
- You know about it, Sulli?

705
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:53,950
- Sulli knows about it.
- I want a house.

706
00:40:53,950 --> 00:40:55,100
A house.

707
00:40:55,110 --> 00:40:57,990
[Sulli's big dream of owning a house.]

708
00:40:57,990 --> 00:40:59,080
- A house?
- House?

709
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:01,100
If Jae Suk buys you a house,
I'll wallpaper it for you.

710
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:05,650
Ja Chul says he wants you to buy him
a house for his wedding gift.

711
00:41:05,650 --> 00:41:10,260
- You're have to take care of all of us.
- Ji Sung should be getting him that.

712
00:41:10,970 --> 00:41:14,160
I think it would be much more fitting for
Ji Sung to get him that gift.

713
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:15,750
- I can do that.
- Really?

714
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:17,910
In exchange, I want him to get me one
when I get married.

715
00:41:18,410 --> 00:41:20,820
Then you can buy each other a house
for your wedding gifts.

716
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:24,200
Why? Are you getting
married sometime soon?

717
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:26,420
- Ji Sung?
- I'm sure I'll get married sometime.

718
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:30,250
- Jae Suk.
- What?

719
00:41:30,250 --> 00:41:34,130
Ja Chul doesn't have an officiator for his
wedding yet and wants you to do it.

720
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:35,520
- The day after tomorrow?
- Yeah.

721
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:38,350
He still doesn't have an officiator
when it's the day after tomorrow?

722
00:41:38,790 --> 00:41:40,430
Jong Kook's agreed to sing a song
at the wedding for him.

723
00:41:40,430 --> 00:41:41,910
- Really?
- Of course.

724
00:41:41,910 --> 00:41:44,930
- What are you going to sing?
- 'You're so lovely'.

725
00:41:44,930 --> 00:41:46,450
And he's going to sing topless.

726
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:49,350
That sounds nice.

727
00:41:49,350 --> 00:41:54,660
If things go well for Ji Sung and he ends up
getting married, we'll have to do something.

728
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:57,250
Gary can catch the bridal bouquet.

729
00:41:57,250 --> 00:41:58,580
[Gary will catch the bouquet?]

730
00:41:58,970 --> 00:42:00,640
What are you going to do
for him, Ja Chul?

731
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:02,640
Me?
I'll sing him a congratulatory song.

732
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:04,130
You will?

733
00:42:05,010 --> 00:42:06,210
Are you a good singer?

734
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:10,650
- When Kwang Soo gets married...
- He'll never get himself married.

735
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:14,380
- Kwang Soo will be alone forever.
- He'll never get married.

736
00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:16,380
I'm only 29 years old.

737
00:42:16,830 --> 00:42:18,640
You're such a liar.

738
00:42:21,610 --> 00:42:24,840
- Why won't you believe me?
- You do look younger, but how old are you?

739
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:26,810
- Ja Chul was so shocked earlier.
- Why?

740
00:42:26,810 --> 00:42:28,910
He was so shocked when he found out
Kwang Soo is friends with Joong Ki.

741
00:42:28,910 --> 00:42:30,010
- Really?
- What?

742
00:42:30,010 --> 00:42:31,840
- They're friends?
- Yeah, they're friends.

743
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,500
What?

744
00:42:33,850 --> 00:42:36,150
They're really good friends.

745
00:42:37,730 --> 00:42:39,050
Ji Sung.

746
00:42:39,050 --> 00:42:40,870
Is your girlfriend a good cook?

747
00:42:44,170 --> 00:42:46,490
Come on, tell us how you two met.

748
00:42:46,490 --> 00:42:50,170
Let's ask him in a more casual setting.
Let's turn off all the cameras.

749
00:42:50,170 --> 00:42:52,480
Okay, so how did you two meet?

750
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:55,580
[Camera back on?]

751
00:42:57,170 --> 00:42:59,410
[So full of sense.]

752
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:02,560
[Cameras off]
How did you two meet?

753
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:04,050
[Why turn off the camera?]

754
00:43:05,230 --> 00:43:07,030
Jae Suk, you try doing something.

755
00:43:07,030 --> 00:43:08,750
Ja Chul, did you not know about it?

756
00:43:08,750 --> 00:43:10,570
- No, I didn't know.
- Really?

757
00:43:10,570 --> 00:43:13,240
I felt so happy because she's
such a nice woman.

758
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:14,880
- Do you know her well?
- What?

759
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:16,120
Do you know her well?

760
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:19,410
[Captain Park's shot at
Suk Jin's statement.]

761
00:43:20,730 --> 00:43:22,910
- Do I have to know her personally?
- Answer the question.

762
00:43:22,910 --> 00:43:25,050
- Do I really have to know her, Ji Sung?
- Suk Jin, you're something else.

763
00:43:25,050 --> 00:43:27,740
I was just saying that I have a feeling
that she's a really nice person.

764
00:43:27,750 --> 00:43:30,310
- Is that right?
- Yes, I just have a feeling that she is.

765
00:43:30,310 --> 00:43:33,580
I could just tell by the way she looks
that she's a really nice person.

766
00:43:33,580 --> 00:43:35,220
Have you proposed to her, Ja Chul?

767
00:43:35,870 --> 00:43:38,670
You don't think he's proposed to her when
he's marrying her the day after tomorrow?

768
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:42,170
[Getting criticized for
every little thing he says.]

769
00:43:42,170 --> 00:43:44,670
- Actually, I never did propose to her.
- You haven't proposed yet?

770
00:43:44,670 --> 00:43:46,900
- Why don't you propose to her right now?
- No, that's not what I meant.

771
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:50,020
- Just propose to her right now.
- What do you mean, propose now?

772
00:43:50,020 --> 00:43:51,640
Why don't you propose to her
through a video message?

773
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:54,600
- What are you talking about?
- He'll never get a chance like this again.

774
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:56,200
Go ahead and propose to her.
We'll make sure that she gets it.

775
00:43:56,210 --> 00:43:57,450
I'm going to do it tomorrow.

776
00:43:57,450 --> 00:43:59,070
- What? Tomorrow?
- You're proposing tomorrow?

777
00:43:59,070 --> 00:44:00,770
- Really?
- You're proposing to her tomorrow?

778
00:44:00,770 --> 00:44:03,050
Why don't you ask Jae Suk to
do the proposing for you?

779
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:04,680
How did you propose to your wife?

780
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:05,900
- What?
- How did you propose?

781
00:44:05,930 --> 00:44:08,260
- He's really not good at things like that.
- I'm horrible at things like that.

782
00:44:08,260 --> 00:44:10,050
I did it very simply in the car.

783
00:44:10,050 --> 00:44:12,900
He doesn't have much style
when it comes to stuff like that.

784
00:44:13,510 --> 00:44:15,890
He doesn't know anything about doing
any surprising events or anything like that.

785
00:44:15,890 --> 00:44:19,840
You'd think that women would like him, right?
Not at all. He's actually repels them.

786
00:44:19,850 --> 00:44:22,180
If I repel them,
I bet you're even worse!

787
00:44:22,620 --> 00:44:25,740
I bet whomever I end up marrying will
become best friends with your wife.

788
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:28,040
Because they're going to have
so much in common.

789
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:30,920
- I think Eun Hye's still waiting.
- Who?

790
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:32,520
- Yoon Eun Hye.
- Ah, Eun Hye?

791
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:34,430
[Ah... this person?]

792
00:44:34,430 --> 00:44:36,430
Wow, Eun Hye...
I really do miss her.

793
00:44:37,860 --> 00:44:40,320
- Eun Hye, are you doing well?
- Come on, stop it.

794
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:44,020
- It's been so long since I've seen you.
- Come on the show sometime, Eun Hye.

795
00:44:44,650 --> 00:44:47,570
In all the times I've seen the show,
I've noticed they never edit that out.

796
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:51,470
They're never going to do that now either
because of what you've just said.

797
00:44:52,030 --> 00:44:53,330
- Ja Chul.
- Yes?

798
00:44:53,330 --> 00:44:56,220
- How are you going to propose?
- Have you planned a special event?

799
00:44:56,220 --> 00:44:58,490
- We've been dating for six years now.
- Wow... really?

800
00:44:58,490 --> 00:45:00,490
- Yes.
- Since you were 19 years old?

801
00:45:00,490 --> 00:45:01,990
- Yes.
- Wow, you've been dating her that long?

802
00:45:01,990 --> 00:45:06,460
- So the six years that we've been dating...
- Various episodes of your relationship?

803
00:45:06,460 --> 00:45:09,200
Like our first meeting, and our first kiss...

804
00:45:09,860 --> 00:45:13,500
Moments of danger... and getting
over those dangerous moments.

805
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:16,730
And like the time when I've made up my mind
that I wanted to marry her and asked her...

806
00:45:16,730 --> 00:45:20,370
I've arranged for two people to perform
a musical to play out those moments.

807
00:45:21,050 --> 00:45:24,000
[Wow... so romantic!]

808
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,380
- Really?
- Who are you using to act that out?

809
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:28,920
- We could be good at that too.
- Why not use Jae Suk?

810
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:31,000
- Why don't you use me?
- How about using Jae Suk and Ji Hyo?

811
00:45:31,010 --> 00:45:32,340
Me and Ji Hyo?

812
00:45:32,890 --> 00:45:35,410
- Why don't you do it with her?
- It should be me and Ji Hyo!

813
00:45:36,310 --> 00:45:39,390
- Then how about Gary and Ji Hyo?
- You can use Gary and Ji Hyo.

814
00:45:39,670 --> 00:45:42,420
- I can even make her tear up.
- I bet that would be really touching.

815
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:44,500
- That's very cool.
- That's so romantic.

816
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:45,920
What about location?
Where are you doing it?

817
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:49,360
I've only been on the receiving end
for the past six years.

818
00:45:49,850 --> 00:45:53,160
- That's why I wanted to do something for her.
- I think I'm going to start tearing up.

819
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:55,690
- So you felt bad for it?
- My style is a bit more like Jae Suk.

820
00:45:55,690 --> 00:45:58,090
I'm not good at things like that.
But...

821
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:00,980
- You know what I mean, don't you?
- Of course, I do.

822
00:46:00,980 --> 00:46:03,990
- Yes, he does know.
- Just continue to be on the receiving end.

823
00:46:05,610 --> 00:46:08,600
- What's wrong with you?
- Just thank her for it...

824
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:12,640
Thank her for it, but just continue to
receive whatever she has to give.

825
00:46:12,980 --> 00:46:14,700
- Has everyone finished eating?
- Yes.

826
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:17,730
We're going to play
a very simple game right now.

827
00:46:17,730 --> 00:46:21,060
- You know what the game will be, don't you?
- Is it a question game?

828
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:23,210
This is a question game.
Like a relay question game.

829
00:46:23,210 --> 00:46:25,000
We'll start asking question

830
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,900
and whomever the question goes to
when the alarm ends loses the game.

831
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:29,260
- Do we have to answer the question?
- You have to answer the question.

832
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:32,970
[What's the allotted time?]

833
00:46:32,970 --> 00:46:34,180
Ready, go.

834
00:46:35,610 --> 00:46:36,990
Are you happy?

835
00:46:38,180 --> 00:46:39,750
Of course... I am.

836
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:42,840
Does being married make you happy?

837
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:47,110
It makes me so happy that I'm not sure
if it's fair for me to be this happy.

838
00:46:47,110 --> 00:46:49,210
- You're that happy?
- I can't even express how much.

839
00:46:51,510 --> 00:46:54,830
- Here. Where are you going to propose?
- You have to ask your opposing team.

840
00:46:54,860 --> 00:46:58,470
[Don't you know the rules?
Pass the alarm to your opposing team!]

841
00:46:58,470 --> 00:47:01,790
- Why are you passing it to your own team?
- Don't you even know how to play this?

842
00:47:01,790 --> 00:47:03,320
- The proposal?
- Where are you going to do it?

843
00:47:03,330 --> 00:47:05,000
At a small theater.

844
00:47:06,380 --> 00:47:08,370
Ji Sung, I'm sorry, but...

845
00:47:09,430 --> 00:47:11,020
Why did you go to Han River?

846
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:15,490
I went to Han river to have some chicken
after seeing a soccer match.

847
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:19,860
But I didn't know so many people
would find out about it.

848
00:47:20,850 --> 00:47:23,410
Who's your favorite soccer player?

849
00:47:23,410 --> 00:47:26,360
[Asking Sulli who her favorite
soccer player is?]

850
00:47:27,820 --> 00:47:30,860
This is Park Ji Sung's question?

851
00:47:30,860 --> 00:47:32,770
You've got Park Ji Sung and Gu Ja Chul
sitting next to you.

852
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:35,480
I'm curious to see what she'll say.

853
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:39,960
[What will Sulli's answer be?]

854
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:43,420
Ji Sung is the best.

855
00:47:44,540 --> 00:47:46,390
That's because she's on
his team right now.

856
00:47:46,390 --> 00:47:49,070
- What kind of an answer is that?
- Ja Chul is sitting right next to you.

857
00:47:49,070 --> 00:47:51,690
- Are you okay?
- Look at Ja Chul sitting next to you.

858
00:47:51,690 --> 00:47:54,420
- What kind of a question is that now?
- She asked you if you're okay.

859
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,920
I gave her a look
as soon as I saw her earlier.

860
00:47:57,930 --> 00:47:59,540
But I guess you didn't see that.

861
00:47:59,550 --> 00:48:01,150
Aren't you getting married
the day after tomorrow?

862
00:48:01,820 --> 00:48:04,160
- Get your head on straight!
- Aren't you getting married?

863
00:48:04,170 --> 00:48:05,800
- What kind of a response is that?
- You need to get your head on straight.

864
00:48:06,190 --> 00:48:08,990
[Team Gu Ja Chul-
Jong Kook and Ji Hyo are currently out.]

865
00:48:08,990 --> 00:48:11,440
- You love your wife, don't you?
- Of course, I love her very much.

866
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:13,480
Can you send your wife a
video message?

867
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:17,180
- Make it short! A short one!
- I love you!

868
00:48:17,180 --> 00:48:18,490
- There you go!
- Forever!

869
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:21,070
- Hurry up!
- How about a video message?

870
00:48:21,070 --> 00:48:23,490
- To whom?
- How about a video message?

871
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:26,420
- To whom?
- To your lady.

872
00:48:26,780 --> 00:48:28,670
- Hurry up and to it!
- To your lady.

873
00:48:28,670 --> 00:48:29,980
I love you!

874
00:48:30,930 --> 00:48:32,470
- Hurry.
- I love you!

875
00:48:38,140 --> 00:48:39,720
- Kwang Soo.
- Yes, Ji Sung?

876
00:48:40,020 --> 00:48:43,420
If you were put in the match,
do you think you could score a goal?

877
00:48:43,830 --> 00:48:47,370
- I think one goal would be possible.
- What a load of crock.

878
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:49,240
Sulli.

879
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:52,690
Can you tell us the ranking of best looking to
worst looking of all the men here right now?

880
00:48:53,150 --> 00:48:56,230
You're in last place.

881
00:48:56,650 --> 00:48:59,380
[The worst looking of all the Running Man
members according to Sulli's ranking.]

882
00:49:00,670 --> 00:49:03,040
I didn't eat any breakfast yesterday.

883
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:04,170
- Dong Hoon.
- Yeah?

884
00:49:04,170 --> 00:49:05,310
Hurry, hurry.

885
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:07,350
- Hurry up and ask.
- Do you truly want to run in the game?

886
00:49:07,350 --> 00:49:11,490
Yeah, I really want to run. You've
dated a celebrity before, haven't you?

887
00:49:14,060 --> 00:49:16,700
- Nice! Nice question!
- Have you or not?

888
00:49:17,610 --> 00:49:19,730
Does he even have to answer
that question?

889
00:49:19,730 --> 00:49:21,780
- Have you dated one or not?
- Hurry up and answer.

890
00:49:21,780 --> 00:49:23,380
[Out!]

891
00:49:23,380 --> 00:49:25,980
[Why is he getting so overexcited?]

892
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:29,550
- There's no way that you have.
- Why not? He could've!

893
00:49:29,850 --> 00:49:32,850
Why are you getting so
flustered, Kwang Soo?

894
00:49:32,850 --> 00:49:34,380
You could've just said, no.

895
00:49:34,380 --> 00:49:37,010
- You could've just answered, no.
- Hurry up and get out of there.

896
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:40,380
- Get out of there, Kwang Soo.
- Kwang Soo can't lie about stuff like that.

897
00:49:40,380 --> 00:49:41,420
Are you doing well?

898
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:45,650
[Time over- Kwang Soo is out!]

899
00:49:46,950 --> 00:49:48,160
- Suk Jin.
- Yeah?

900
00:49:49,030 --> 00:49:50,850
Your wife isn't your
first love, is she?

901
00:49:52,810 --> 00:49:56,570
No, the thing is...
I really don't remember.

902
00:49:56,570 --> 00:49:58,530
But it's very possible
that she was my first love.

903
00:49:58,530 --> 00:50:00,200
What about you?

904
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:02,820
- Is your wife your first love?
- Everyone knows the answer to that.

905
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:06,500
She may not be my first love,
but she's my last love.

906
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:10,630
How about a video message
to your first love?

907
00:50:10,630 --> 00:50:11,680
[A video message to Suk Jin's
first love?]

908
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:13,880
Are you doing well?

909
00:50:14,410 --> 00:50:16,010
Are you doing well?

910
00:50:16,010 --> 00:50:19,000
[A video message that's
years... past due.]

911
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,710
You're well, aren't you?

912
00:50:23,260 --> 00:50:26,300
[Time's up with his video message.]

913
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:31,730
What's your reasoning for saying that
Park Ji Sung is better than Gu Ja Chul?

914
00:50:31,730 --> 00:50:33,550
- Yeah.
- I want to hear your answer to that.

915
00:50:33,550 --> 00:50:35,590
- Yeah, I want to hear it.
- I'm curious to know.

916
00:50:35,590 --> 00:50:37,150
What is it that our Ja Chul is lacking?

917
00:50:37,150 --> 00:50:39,780
- Why is Ja Chul...
- First, Ji Sung is the captain.

918
00:50:39,780 --> 00:50:41,670
- Okay, Park Ji Sung is the captain?
- Yes.

919
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:45,590
What the heck is this?
Ja Chul is a captain too.

920
00:50:45,590 --> 00:50:47,630
- Who's better looking?
- When it comes to looks...

921
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:50,580
Well... both of them...

922
00:50:50,580 --> 00:50:52,440
- Both of them?
- You have to just pick one.

923
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:55,560
- What are you talking about, Sulli?
- What if you had to pick one?

924
00:50:55,560 --> 00:50:57,820
How old were you when you started
playing sports?

925
00:50:57,820 --> 00:51:00,250
When I was... 12 years old.

926
00:51:00,250 --> 00:51:02,190
Do you not know that I'm
also a captain?

927
00:51:02,190 --> 00:51:04,240
- Ah... really?
- Yes, he is!

928
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:07,420
- Yes, that's right, he is.
- I had no idea. I'm sorry.

929
00:51:09,630 --> 00:51:13,420
[Time over- Sulli, out!]

930
00:51:13,420 --> 00:51:19,580
What do you think the possibilities are
of our country rising to

931
00:51:19,590 --> 00:51:22,330
at least sixteenth in ranking
at the next world cup competition?

932
00:51:23,890 --> 00:51:25,390
That's a great question.

933
00:51:25,390 --> 00:51:28,660
As long as people will put their faith in me,
I guarantee 100% that we'll be up there.

934
00:51:28,660 --> 00:51:32,070
[Determined to make it 100% as long as
people put their faith in him.]

935
00:51:33,370 --> 00:51:34,620
Captain Park.

936
00:51:35,030 --> 00:51:37,120
Do you have any interest
in coming back?

937
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:40,320
Do you have any interest
in coming back?

938
00:51:40,330 --> 00:51:47,500
[Coming back to his home team?]

939
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:57,870
[The alarm chooses to go off
right at that moment!]

940
00:52:01,140 --> 00:52:02,550
I can't believe the alarm went off!

941
00:52:02,550 --> 00:52:04,950
We didn't even get to
hear his answer!

942
00:52:04,950 --> 00:52:07,340
I wish we could've heard his answer!

943
00:52:07,790 --> 00:52:10,670
Could you have given us a
warning on that?

944
00:52:12,260 --> 00:52:14,860
Wow, I was so curious to
hear his answer.

945
00:52:16,470 --> 00:52:19,890
Ji Sung, that last question really was...

946
00:52:19,890 --> 00:52:22,840
[The question that they're all very curious
to hear the answer to.]

947
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:24,210
I was so eager to hear
what your answer was going to be.

948
00:52:24,210 --> 00:52:28,880
But I could tell that Ji Sung
was just about to answer that question.

949
00:52:28,890 --> 00:52:31,390
I was just about to answer it
when the alarm went off.

950
00:52:31,780 --> 00:52:33,810
Can you text us the answer later?

951
00:52:35,070 --> 00:52:37,530
- I can tell you guys the answer now.
- Then tell us.

952
00:52:37,540 --> 00:52:38,690
Can you tell us?

953
00:52:38,690 --> 00:52:41,430
This is going to be broadcasted
later on anyway.

954
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:45,230
Well, unfortunately...
I don't think it's time for me yet to...

955
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:49,430
I don't have the intention of going out
to the world cup as a player yet.

956
00:52:49,430 --> 00:52:50,620
- Not yet?
- No.

957
00:52:50,620 --> 00:52:52,300
[No desire to play in the world cup
as a player himself yet.]

958
00:52:52,300 --> 00:52:55,880
Even though many people have
mentioned it to me...

959
00:52:55,880 --> 00:53:00,120
but there are other players who haven't had
the chance to run yet, like Gu Ja Chul.

960
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:04,420
When players like that play the game,
then it'll change the team as a whole.

961
00:53:04,590 --> 00:53:11,360
[Wanting to give the chance at the honor
to his juniors...]

962
00:53:11,870 --> 00:53:14,210
I don't think this is the right time
for me to make that comeback yet.

963
00:53:14,210 --> 00:53:17,080
I'm different than the person
I was two years ago.

964
00:53:17,080 --> 00:53:18,620
[On top of everything else,
he's different than he was two years ago.]

965
00:53:18,620 --> 00:53:22,160
But still,
if you really want to talk it out...

966
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:24,500
even though you may feel that way now,
once you think about it some more

967
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:27,760
you never know how you'll feel later on,
and you may change your mind down the road.

968
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:29,870
- That's true.
- I'm sure Ji Sung will make the right choice.

969
00:53:29,870 --> 00:53:31,630
We just want to
see him back, that's all.

970
00:53:31,630 --> 00:53:33,730
That's what the people of
this country feel.

971
00:53:33,730 --> 00:53:36,180
Just having him back would
make us feel so much more confidant.

972
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:41,760
[No matter what you decide,
we'll stand by your decision.]

973
00:53:45,010 --> 00:53:47,670
[Korea Polar Research Institute-
The last training session!]

974
00:53:47,670 --> 00:53:51,340
- You need to work on your soccer skills more.
- Aren't those name tags?

975
00:53:51,340 --> 00:53:52,970
- What's that?
- Those are name tags.

976
00:53:52,970 --> 00:53:54,650
That's how we're going to
oust each other?

977
00:53:54,650 --> 00:53:56,380
Ah... that's how we're going to do it?

978
00:53:56,380 --> 00:53:59,410
Ah, do we have to hit the ones with our
own name on it to get it on our backs?

979
00:53:59,410 --> 00:54:02,120
I think that's how we get the name tags.
I'm going to get Ji Sung's name and oust it.

980
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:03,940
[Name tags of various different sizes
on the goal post looking set?]

981
00:54:03,940 --> 00:54:05,880
If you get the big one,
then you're pretty much out.

982
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:06,990
Yeah, you're as good as out.

983
00:54:06,990 --> 00:54:08,800
<i>This will be your last mission
of the night.</i>

984
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:12,550
<i>Song Ji Hyo, and Sulli.
Please step forward.</i>

985
00:54:12,550 --> 00:54:13,990
[Ji Hyo and Sulli asked to step up front.]

986
00:54:13,990 --> 00:54:16,120
<i>These two ladies will get to go first.</i>

987
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:18,890
[The two to enter first?]

988
00:54:18,890 --> 00:54:20,850
- Good luck.
- Wait for us.

989
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:27,770
- What are we going to be doing in there?
- I guess we'll go in and just wait for them.

990
00:54:27,770 --> 00:54:29,770
- Don't you think?
- I guess.

991
00:54:29,770 --> 00:54:31,240
We'll have to wait for them?

992
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:33,120
Your last mission is...

993
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:35,200
'Rescue your Queen'.

994
00:54:35,210 --> 00:54:36,730
[The next mission-
Rescue your queen.]

995
00:54:36,730 --> 00:54:42,030
Ji Hyo and Sulli will enter the building and
will be placed somewhere inside the building.

996
00:54:42,030 --> 00:54:43,920
They'll be placed separately
in two different rooms.

997
00:54:44,210 --> 00:54:47,160
We have to stay in hiding until our own
teammate comes to rescue us?

998
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:48,190
I'm scared.

999
00:54:48,190 --> 00:54:50,160
- Can our opponents oust us?
- Be careful, Ji Hyo.

1000
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:51,830
- See you later, Sulli.
- Okay.

1001
00:54:51,830 --> 00:54:55,670
[Not knowing where they're being led to
with their eyes blindfolded.]

1002
00:54:56,070 --> 00:54:57,300
Guys...

1003
00:55:00,780 --> 00:55:02,300
I feel like I'm going to bump
into something.

1004
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:04,220
It's so dark!

1005
00:55:04,220 --> 00:55:05,790
This is really scary.

1006
00:55:06,540 --> 00:55:09,240
<i>The rest of the men cannot
enter the building right away.</i>

1007
00:55:09,250 --> 00:55:11,270
<i>- Do you see your name tags up there?
- Yes.</i>

1008
00:55:11,270 --> 00:55:14,670
<i>Everyone must kick a ball to hit one
of the name tags that are stuck up there</i>

1009
00:55:14,670 --> 00:55:18,280
<i>and when that name tag falls off,
you'll enter with that name tag on your back.</i>

1010
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:20,990
- What if we get someone else's name?
- Wait, what if...

1011
00:55:20,990 --> 00:55:22,960
What if I kick the ball,
and I get Gary's name?

1012
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:24,590
<i>- Then Gary will enter the building.
- Ah...</i>

1013
00:55:24,590 --> 00:55:27,560
- Seriously?
- It doesn't matter who's team you're on.

1014
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:30,260
<i>The person's name tag your ball kicks off
gets to enter the building right away.</i>

1015
00:55:30,260 --> 00:55:32,290
- Ah, I see.
- How am I supposed to get my name?

1016
00:55:32,290 --> 00:55:35,340
- Only two people here can control their aim.
- The most important thing is...

1017
00:55:35,630 --> 00:55:38,190
<i>If your team's queen gets ousted,
then the rest of the team is ousted.</i>

1018
00:55:38,190 --> 00:55:40,220
- Okay, I understand.
- At that point, the game is over.

1019
00:55:40,220 --> 00:55:43,250
- So the quicker we get in there, the better?
- We have to get in there quickly.

1020
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:47,180
<i>You have arrived on the ninth floor.</i>

1021
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:49,150
Ninth floor?

1022
00:55:49,150 --> 00:55:51,400
[By a stroke of luck, she
finds out which floor she arrives on.]

1023
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:58,250
[Queen of Ji Sung's Team is placed
in the waiting room on the ninth floor!]

1024
00:56:06,210 --> 00:56:12,250
Since I don't know if my team,
or the Yellow team will arrive first...

1025
00:56:12,810 --> 00:56:15,420
It's not like I can stay in here
with the doors locked either, can I?

1026
00:56:15,420 --> 00:56:18,560
What if I open the door to peek outside,
and get caught by a Yellow Team member?

1027
00:56:18,560 --> 00:56:20,020
Then I'd be ousted, wouldn't I?

1028
00:56:21,930 --> 00:56:23,190
I can see from here like this.

1029
00:56:24,210 --> 00:56:29,720
[The current location of each queen.]

1030
00:56:30,580 --> 00:56:32,710
- Hey, Ja Chul...
- You're going to kick first?

1031
00:56:32,710 --> 00:56:34,920
- Then do you want to kick first?
- Why would you kick first?

1032
00:56:35,060 --> 00:56:37,100
[Ji Sung to kick off first
for Team Ji Sung.]

1033
00:56:37,100 --> 00:56:38,660
- It's okay.
- Here I go!

1034
00:56:38,670 --> 00:56:39,860
- What are you looking at?
- Which name are you targeting?

1035
00:56:39,860 --> 00:56:43,070
The way I see it, I think
Ji Sung is going after his own name.

1036
00:56:43,390 --> 00:56:45,980
- That's right. His name tag is small.
- I hope he kicks my name tag first.

1037
00:56:45,980 --> 00:56:48,160
- Or kick Kwang Soo's.
- There he goes. Fighting, Ji Sung!

1038
00:56:54,530 --> 00:56:58,360
[Ji Sung kicks!
Who will be the first player to enter?]

1039
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:04,040
- What was that?
- What are you doing?

1040
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:05,720
[Huh?]

1041
00:57:08,290 --> 00:57:10,750
[Wait... Park Ji Sung...]

1042
00:57:10,750 --> 00:57:12,400
- Ji Sung!
- What are you doing?

1043
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:13,640
[His junior not even able to
lift his head up?]

1044
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:15,690
What the heck was that?

1045
00:57:16,330 --> 00:57:18,910
- Ja Chul, what was he doing?
- I think he's too embarrassed for him.

1046
00:57:18,910 --> 00:57:20,840
Ja Chul, are you that
embarrassed for him?

1047
00:57:21,510 --> 00:57:23,610
- What was that?
- Maybe he slipped.

1048
00:57:23,610 --> 00:57:26,940
- He could've made a mistake and slipped.
- How? All he does every day is kick balls.

1049
00:57:26,940 --> 00:57:28,910
I don't kick balls every day.

1050
00:57:29,030 --> 00:57:30,770
I don't kick balls every day.

1051
00:57:31,810 --> 00:57:33,260
Show him how it's done, Ja Chul.

1052
00:57:33,710 --> 00:57:36,050
[Next up is the captain of
Team Ja Chul's turn.]

1053
00:57:36,050 --> 00:57:37,500
Where are you aiming?
Which one are you hitting?

1054
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:40,730
- Are you going to hit the small one?
- You can't just aim for the big name tags.

1055
00:57:40,730 --> 00:57:44,160
Pick either your small one,
or the opposing team's big name.

1056
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:46,920
[Locks in his own small name tag
as his target.]

1057
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:49,610
- Okay.
- Okay, go for that one.

1058
00:57:49,610 --> 00:57:50,900
Okay, Ja Chul.

1059
00:58:02,820 --> 00:58:04,050
Ja Chul.

1060
00:58:04,430 --> 00:58:08,140
[What's going on here?]

1061
00:58:08,140 --> 00:58:11,440
- He did that to be nice.
- He has a very big heart.

1062
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:16,000
- It was for Ji Sung's sake.
- He did that to protect Ji Sung.

1063
00:58:16,690 --> 00:58:19,710
[Junior's everlasting brotherly love.]

1064
00:58:20,420 --> 00:58:22,570
- Okay.
- Ja Chul is so nice.

1065
00:58:22,570 --> 00:58:25,450
- I'm going for my own small name tag.
- Gary will get it.

1066
00:58:25,450 --> 00:58:28,120
If you make a mistake though,
you'll get Ja Chul's big name tag.

1067
00:58:28,620 --> 00:58:29,920
That won't be good.

1068
00:58:30,610 --> 00:58:31,680
Here I go!

1069
00:58:36,730 --> 00:58:37,990
It didn't fall down.

1070
00:58:37,990 --> 00:58:42,110
[The panel must fall off completely
for it to count.]

1071
00:58:42,110 --> 00:58:43,700
It has to fall off.

1072
00:58:43,700 --> 00:58:45,640
- How is that going to fall off?
- I'll go next.

1073
00:58:45,640 --> 00:58:48,430
- Okay, Kwang Soo. You go in.
- If that wasn't enough to make it fall...

1074
00:58:48,430 --> 00:58:50,660
- How did that not fall off?
- You have to kick with your instep.

1075
00:58:50,660 --> 00:58:52,880
Lee Kwang Soo's big name tag
should've fell down.

1076
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:55,160
[Kwang Soo's big name tag-
He could've been in trouble...]

1077
00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:56,360
Challenge.

1078
00:58:57,500 --> 00:58:59,780
How about right there?
Between Kim Jong Kook and Yoo Jae Suk.

1079
00:59:01,240 --> 00:59:03,860
- Is it that hard to kick it on the name?
- Even we didn't get it.

1080
00:59:03,860 --> 00:59:06,500
- Is it that hard?
- I guess I'll have to show how it's done.

1081
00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:07,560
Challenge.

1082
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:09,720
- You're just going to kick, aren't you?
- Anyone could be a target.

1083
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:16,590
- I should've kicked harder.
- See?

1084
00:59:17,620 --> 00:59:20,950
[How is it not a single person
can kick it right?]

1085
00:59:20,950 --> 00:59:22,010
Are we even going to be able to
get this done tonight?

1086
00:59:22,010 --> 00:59:25,380
I'm going to kick towards that corner with
Yoo Jae Suk, Gary, and Gu Ja Chul.

1087
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:27,030
Here I go.

1088
00:59:27,030 --> 00:59:28,840
[After all that big talk,
will he be able to get it done?]

1089
00:59:31,810 --> 00:59:33,880
[Homerun!]

1090
00:59:35,990 --> 00:59:37,890
[Humiliation]

1091
00:59:38,580 --> 00:59:40,980
What is it that
you're actually good at?

1092
00:59:40,980 --> 00:59:43,310
What can you actually do
when balls are involved?

1093
00:59:43,310 --> 00:59:45,960
All you've got is your brute strength.

1094
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:47,930
- Come here. Just get back here.
- I kicked it too hard.

1095
00:59:47,930 --> 00:59:49,700
This isn't easy for any one of us.

1096
00:59:49,700 --> 00:59:51,840
[Captain Ji Sung's turn once again.]

1097
00:59:52,550 --> 00:59:55,340
[Perhaps he'll kick it more accurately
with it being his second try.]

1098
00:59:55,340 --> 00:59:56,790
We're all watching you!

1099
01:00:04,830 --> 01:00:08,250
[A direct hit on Gu Ja Chul's name!]

1100
01:00:12,060 --> 01:00:14,050
[Roaring out as if
celebrating a huge goal!]

1101
01:00:14,370 --> 01:00:16,110
[I'm ruined...]

1102
01:00:16,470 --> 01:00:18,760
You hit Ja Chul's big name tag!

1103
01:00:18,760 --> 01:00:22,420
[Sending in the captain of the opposing team
with the large name tag on his back.]

1104
01:00:23,450 --> 01:00:26,170
- Ja Chul, you've got the big name tag.
- I can't believe you got that.

1105
01:00:26,170 --> 01:00:27,520
[Here's your large name tag.]

1106
01:00:29,350 --> 01:00:32,690
[Ja Chul of Team Ja Chul enters
with the big name tag on his back.]

1107
01:00:33,360 --> 01:00:36,000
- Good luck, Ja Chul.
- We'll see you in there.

1108
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,330
- You have to protect Ji Hyo.
- I'll be right in, so wait for me in there.

1109
01:00:38,930 --> 01:00:42,310
Now that Ja Chul's going in,
I need to get in there too.

1110
01:00:42,310 --> 01:00:43,750
Hurry up and kick.

1111
01:00:43,750 --> 01:00:45,490
[Kim-Leave it of Ja Chul Team's turn.]

1112
01:00:46,890 --> 01:00:48,910
Where are you going to kick it?
Are you going to kick it up there?

1113
01:00:50,630 --> 01:00:52,230
No, I'm going to kick it over there.

1114
01:00:58,300 --> 01:01:01,220
We know that you like soccer.

1115
01:01:01,220 --> 01:01:03,890
- You're just a spectator of the sport.
- We know that you like to watch soccer.

1116
01:01:03,890 --> 01:01:05,720
You just like to watch soccer.

1117
01:01:05,720 --> 01:01:06,950
Fighting.

1118
01:01:14,890 --> 01:01:17,080
[Huh?]

1119
01:01:17,080 --> 01:01:19,710
[A large name tag for his own
teammate, Ha Ha?]

1120
01:01:20,070 --> 01:01:21,330
Me? Ha Ha?

1121
01:01:22,210 --> 01:01:23,740
- That was the big name tag.
- Big name tag?

1122
01:01:23,750 --> 01:01:25,380
You kicked off my big name tag?

1123
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:27,850
I'm going to rip off your name tag
as soon as I get in there.

1124
01:01:27,860 --> 01:01:31,290
[Jae Suk bringing disadvantage
to his own team...]

1125
01:01:31,960 --> 01:01:34,000
I was aiming for Jong Kook's name.

1126
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:37,060
[Ji Sung Team's Ha Ha enters the building
with the big name tag on his back.]

1127
01:01:37,070 --> 01:01:38,840
Jae Suk, Jong Kook and Gary's names
are all bunched together.

1128
01:01:41,490 --> 01:01:42,690
Ji Hyo?

1129
01:01:42,690 --> 01:01:44,300
Ji Hyo, can you hear me?

1130
01:01:44,870 --> 01:01:46,870
- Ji Hyo?
- Hello?

1131
01:01:47,310 --> 01:01:49,350
It's me, Gu Ja Chul.

1132
01:01:49,820 --> 01:01:53,400
- Gu Ja Chul, hurry up.
- Where are you right now?

1133
01:01:53,970 --> 01:01:57,350
I don't know where I'm at.
I was blindfolded when they took me.

1134
01:01:57,350 --> 01:02:01,170
- But I'm in... a lab or something.
- A lab?

1135
01:02:01,990 --> 01:02:04,730
- Okay, okay. I'll be right there.
- Okay.

1136
01:02:04,730 --> 01:02:06,360
Wait just a little bit longer.

1137
01:02:06,360 --> 01:02:07,490
Fighting.

1138
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:10,330
Thank goodness for Gu Ja Chul.

1139
01:02:11,350 --> 01:02:13,690
So I have to search through this
whole place for her?

1140
01:02:13,690 --> 01:02:15,350
When am I ever going to find her
in this bid place?

1141
01:02:15,350 --> 01:02:17,660
A lab?
Lab, lab...

1142
01:02:18,990 --> 01:02:20,880
How fast can you run a 100m dash?

1143
01:02:21,250 --> 01:02:23,250
I run that in 12 seconds.
Will you be okay with that?

1144
01:02:26,900 --> 01:02:28,430
Gu Ja Chul!

1145
01:02:29,890 --> 01:02:31,790
How?
How did you find me so quickly?

1146
01:02:31,790 --> 01:02:33,430
[Ja Chul meets up with his queen, Ji Hyo!]

1147
01:02:33,430 --> 01:02:35,380
- Is no one else here yet?
- No, no one else is here.

1148
01:02:35,380 --> 01:02:37,580
[Gets lucky enough to find her
as soon as he enters the building!]

1149
01:02:38,370 --> 01:02:40,840
You were too easy to find
as soon as I got in here.

1150
01:02:41,130 --> 01:02:43,650
- Can we move you to a different place?
- Yes, I can move. Let's go.

1151
01:02:43,650 --> 01:02:46,230
- We should move before someone else comes in.
- This spot isn't a good hiding spot.

1152
01:02:46,230 --> 01:02:47,650
This isn't a good spot?

1153
01:02:47,980 --> 01:02:49,690
Where are you, Sulli?

1154
01:02:50,010 --> 01:02:53,190
- It's me, Ha Ha. Where are you?
- Ha Ha, I'm on the ninth floor.

1155
01:02:53,590 --> 01:02:55,110
Okay, I got it.
I'm on my way right now.

1156
01:03:00,690 --> 01:03:03,030
- Sulli.
- Yeah?

1157
01:03:03,330 --> 01:03:05,920
<i>I'm on the ninth floor right now.</i>

1158
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:10,840
Ha Ha... I'm in a room.
Come and find me quickly.

1159
01:03:10,840 --> 01:03:12,900
It's okay for you to come out right now.
No one else is here.

1160
01:03:13,300 --> 01:03:14,670
Where are you?

1161
01:03:15,030 --> 01:03:16,690
- Ha Ha.
- Where are you?

1162
01:03:16,690 --> 01:03:18,300
- Ha Ha!
- Where are you?

1163
01:03:18,300 --> 01:03:20,260
- Ha Ha, I'm right here.
- Where are you? I'm coming.

1164
01:03:21,820 --> 01:03:25,090
[Ha Ha and Ji Sung Team's
queen, Sulli meet up!]

1165
01:03:30,710 --> 01:03:32,230
I'll show you my spin kick.

1166
01:03:32,590 --> 01:03:34,700
Just show us your regular kick.

1167
01:03:35,210 --> 01:03:36,630
Here's my spin kick.

1168
01:03:36,630 --> 01:03:39,430
I'm sure it'll go out that way.
I don't even need to see that.

1169
01:03:40,290 --> 01:03:43,620
- Why? What's even the point?
- All I have to do is kick up a little.

1170
01:03:43,620 --> 01:03:46,180
I just need to kick it up a little.
Okay, I got it.

1171
01:03:46,820 --> 01:03:48,060
Okay, here I go.

1172
01:03:48,060 --> 01:03:49,990
[Will he be able to do it?]

1173
01:03:53,850 --> 01:03:55,650
Didn't I tell you?
I told you he'd kick it off to that side.

1174
01:03:55,650 --> 01:03:57,830
Yeah, you were right.
How did you know he'd do that?

1175
01:03:57,830 --> 01:03:59,870
- I almost had it.
- Just get back here.

1176
01:04:00,020 --> 01:04:02,570
[Will Jong Kook be able to hit
any of his targets sometime today?]

1177
01:04:02,570 --> 01:04:03,870
- I know where to kick it now.
- Challenge.

1178
01:04:07,290 --> 01:04:08,340
Challenge.

1179
01:04:08,340 --> 01:04:10,830
- Needs to kick it hard enough for it to fall.
- I have to get in there quickly.

1180
01:04:13,900 --> 01:04:16,350
[Almost got Jong Kook's big name tag.]

1181
01:04:16,350 --> 01:04:18,380
Hey!
You almost made mine fall!

1182
01:04:18,620 --> 01:04:22,020
- What's wrong with you?
- Ji Sung, hit Jong Kook's.

1183
01:04:22,020 --> 01:04:23,640
No, he can't do that.

1184
01:04:23,650 --> 01:04:25,040
[Ji Sung's turn once again
with his spot on kicks.]

1185
01:04:26,750 --> 01:04:27,980
Wait, wait.

1186
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:34,420
[That's Kwang Soo's name tag?]

1187
01:04:35,660 --> 01:04:38,780
[Doing nice things for others...]

1188
01:04:38,780 --> 01:04:40,530
He hit the small one.

1189
01:04:40,530 --> 01:04:42,630
Ugh, that really is too bad.

1190
01:04:43,840 --> 01:04:45,430
- Must be nice for you.
- Thank you.

1191
01:04:46,060 --> 01:04:49,130
[Kwang Soo enters with a small
name tag on his back.]

1192
01:04:49,750 --> 01:04:55,180
<i>Lee Kwang Soo of Gu Ja Chul's team
makes his entrance.</i>

1193
01:05:01,500 --> 01:05:04,640
[A direct hit on Gary's small name tag!]

1194
01:05:04,640 --> 01:05:06,070
Gary is a nice hit.
Good to get Gary in there.

1195
01:05:06,070 --> 01:05:07,820
Gary's good.

1196
01:05:08,950 --> 01:05:12,180
[Gary enters with the small
name tag on his back.]

1197
01:05:13,470 --> 01:05:15,470
Can I go a little to the right of the line?

1198
01:05:15,470 --> 01:05:18,570
- Is he allowed to do that?
- I'm not moving up or anything.

1199
01:05:18,570 --> 01:05:21,040
I just won't go up in front of the line.
Why?

1200
01:05:21,050 --> 01:05:23,660
Where in soccer have you ever seen a
penalty kick kicked off from the side?

1201
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:25,470
You know he's right.

1202
01:05:25,470 --> 01:05:29,330
- You have to kick it from the white line.
- What he's saying is right.

1203
01:05:29,340 --> 01:05:32,480
[What he said isn't wrong!]

1204
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:34,490
Kick a little more to the right
than what you're thinking.

1205
01:05:34,490 --> 01:05:37,600
Since your kicks keep going to the left,
kick more to the right than you'd think.

1206
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:39,810
I'm going to shock you with my kick.
You just wait.

1207
01:05:39,820 --> 01:05:41,770
- Okay, please do.
- You just wait.

1208
01:05:41,770 --> 01:05:43,180
He's going to kick that way again.

1209
01:05:46,990 --> 01:05:50,030
[Ji Sung is right on once again!]

1210
01:05:51,310 --> 01:05:53,170
Ji Sung keeps saying that way.
I wonder why that is?

1211
01:05:53,170 --> 01:05:55,540
Can't I move the ball over a little?
That spot would be perfect for me.

1212
01:05:55,550 --> 01:05:57,270
That spot would be perfect for me.

1213
01:05:58,110 --> 01:06:03,220
<i>Gary of Park Ji Sung's team
makes his entrance.</i>

1214
01:06:04,250 --> 01:06:05,520
Sulli.

1215
01:06:06,040 --> 01:06:07,660
It's Gary.
Which floor are you on?

1216
01:06:07,660 --> 01:06:09,910
Gary, come to the ninth floor.
We're on the ninth floor.

1217
01:06:09,910 --> 01:06:11,270
Ninth floor.

1218
01:06:11,270 --> 01:06:12,550
<i>Okay.</i>

1219
01:06:12,550 --> 01:06:14,070
Kwang Soo.

1220
01:06:14,070 --> 01:06:15,570
Which floor are you on?

1221
01:06:15,840 --> 01:06:19,050
Kwang Soo,
Ji Hyo's on the second floor.

1222
01:06:19,050 --> 01:06:21,160
Let's meet up on the second floor since
no one else from the other team is here.

1223
01:06:21,160 --> 01:06:22,720
[Suggesting that they meet up on
second floor where their queen, Ji Hyo is.]

1224
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:24,990
<i>Ji Hyo is on the second floor.</i>

1225
01:06:28,140 --> 01:06:29,710
Which floor on you on, Ja Chul?

1226
01:06:31,840 --> 01:06:32,970
What?

1227
01:06:35,390 --> 01:06:37,900
Eighth floor?

1228
01:06:38,060 --> 01:06:41,660
[With the bad reception on the walkie-talkie,
mistakes second floor for eighth floor.]

1229
01:06:42,070 --> 01:06:45,250
[Giraffe heading up to the eighth floor.]

1230
01:06:45,970 --> 01:06:47,800
Where are you?

1231
01:06:51,060 --> 01:06:52,200
Ji Hyo.

1232
01:06:54,750 --> 01:06:56,400
<i>Kwang Soo, where are you?</i>

1233
01:06:57,290 --> 01:07:00,670
- I'm on the eighth floor.
- Are you coming to second floor or not?

1234
01:07:01,450 --> 01:07:03,340
Are you going to come or not?

1235
01:07:03,740 --> 01:07:05,600
Tenth floor?
Tenth floor?

1236
01:07:08,210 --> 01:07:10,770
- Okay, just stay right there.
- I'll go up to the tenth floor.

1237
01:07:12,590 --> 01:07:14,960
[Giraffe heading up to the tenth floor.]

1238
01:07:15,980 --> 01:07:19,570
[But the problem is...]

1239
01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:22,870
[These guys are on ninth floor.]

1240
01:07:22,870 --> 01:07:25,580
Are you alone?

1241
01:07:26,810 --> 01:07:29,860
[This is the chance!
Get the Giraffe while he's alone!]

1242
01:07:30,630 --> 01:07:32,680
[What luck is this!]

1243
01:07:33,420 --> 01:07:35,590
[Giraffe making his escape up
onto the roof.]

1244
01:07:37,150 --> 01:07:38,890
[Queen unsure of what may happen,
and goes back into hiding.]

1245
01:07:38,890 --> 01:07:40,720
One, two, three.

1246
01:07:46,260 --> 01:07:48,660
Ja Chul, come up to the roof.
They're all up here. To the roof.

1247
01:07:50,590 --> 01:07:53,180
[Receives Giraffe's call for help.]

1248
01:07:53,180 --> 01:07:54,630
Okay, the rooftop.
Just stay right here.

1249
01:07:56,770 --> 01:07:59,100
[Ja Chul off to rescue the Giraffe!]

1250
01:07:59,100 --> 01:08:00,720
Wait, I'll be right there.

1251
01:08:03,250 --> 01:08:05,470
[Giraffe in extreme danger!]

1252
01:08:06,100 --> 01:08:07,630
I don't know what to do.

1253
01:08:11,110 --> 01:08:13,660
[Giraffe with quick moves!
Handling the two on his own rather well!]

1254
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:20,500
[Giraffe showing superhuman strength
succeeds in escaping from them!]

1255
01:08:21,160 --> 01:08:23,930
[The two kiddos very disappointed
at having lost their chance!]

1256
01:08:25,120 --> 01:08:26,500
This is our chance to get him.

1257
01:08:29,620 --> 01:08:32,800
[Huh? Giving up their
chase on the ninth floor?]

1258
01:08:32,800 --> 01:08:34,200
We have to protect Sulli.

1259
01:08:34,200 --> 01:08:35,550
That's too bad.

1260
01:08:35,550 --> 01:08:38,160
When did he get so strong?

1261
01:08:38,160 --> 01:08:40,840
- I can't believe he got away.
- Sulli.

1262
01:08:41,410 --> 01:08:43,000
- Where did she go? Sulli.
- Yes?

1263
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,030
I think we're going to have to run, Sulli.

1264
01:08:45,030 --> 01:08:47,250
[Really good at hiding...]

1265
01:08:47,250 --> 01:08:48,700
We're going to have to
move our hiding spot.

1266
01:08:48,700 --> 01:08:50,260
- Let's move elsewhere.
- Let's hurry.

1267
01:08:50,260 --> 01:08:51,950
Thank goodness you two survived!

1268
01:08:51,950 --> 01:08:53,320
- You can't die!
- Okay, don't worry.

1269
01:08:53,320 --> 01:08:55,420
We survived, but we didn't get him.

1270
01:08:59,140 --> 01:09:01,330
Ja Chul!
Where have you been?

1271
01:09:02,570 --> 01:09:04,520
I just almost got eliminated!

1272
01:09:04,520 --> 01:09:06,040
[Barely having made his escape.]

1273
01:09:06,350 --> 01:09:08,190
Those two are walking around
together right now.

1274
01:09:08,190 --> 01:09:10,860
What's Jong Kook doing?
He was pretending to be so good at soccer.

1275
01:09:10,860 --> 01:09:13,260
- What's taking him so long?
- All he does is talk about how good he is.

1276
01:09:13,260 --> 01:09:15,910
- We have to last until he gets here.
- I know.

1277
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:19,130
[Have to make plans to survive
until Jong Kook comes in.]

1278
01:09:20,250 --> 01:09:22,990
Okay, this time... if not Suk Jin,
then it'll be Jae Suk's name.

1279
01:09:22,990 --> 01:09:25,010
- Or Ji Sung's big name.
- Get the one on the left.

1280
01:09:25,010 --> 01:09:26,410
Okay?
Here I go.

1281
01:09:26,410 --> 01:09:27,420
Challenge.

1282
01:09:28,750 --> 01:09:32,430
[Another homerun...]

1283
01:09:33,200 --> 01:09:35,440
You're nothing but a soccer spectator.

1284
01:09:35,440 --> 01:09:37,370
If he can't get his name,
then he can't go in, right?

1285
01:09:37,380 --> 01:09:41,150
- Yes, that's correct.
- Then no need to get Jong Kook's name.

1286
01:09:41,150 --> 01:09:43,780
- Then there's no need to get his name.
- Hey! I can get my own name!

1287
01:09:43,780 --> 01:09:46,380
- Just hurry up and kick it?
- We don't have to send him in then.

1288
01:09:46,380 --> 01:09:49,000
[If it's left up to him to get his own name,
then he may never actually make it in.]

1289
01:09:49,010 --> 01:09:51,760
- He won't ever get his own name.
- To the left is either Jae Suk or Ji Sung.

1290
01:09:51,760 --> 01:09:54,980
[What's the point of looking and
strategizing all night?]

1291
01:09:55,910 --> 01:09:58,610
I didn't say, 'Challenge'.

1292
01:09:59,500 --> 01:10:01,890
- You scared me for a moment.
- You're so honest. You don't have to say it.

1293
01:10:01,890 --> 01:10:03,000
[ You don't really have to say it...]

1294
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,150
Good. That's a good looking setup.
Nice.

1295
01:10:08,490 --> 01:10:10,910
[A direct hit on
Yoo Jae Suk's small name tag!]

1296
01:10:10,940 --> 01:10:12,570
[A direct hit!]

1297
01:10:15,540 --> 01:10:19,070
[Jae Suk of Ji Sung's Team entering
with the small name tag on his back!]

1298
01:10:19,070 --> 01:10:20,560
We needed Ja Chul to stay here.

1299
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:22,790
Jae Suk, should I get my own name tag
to get in there or what?

1300
01:10:23,160 --> 01:10:25,160
- You want me to get Jong Kook's name?
- Yeah, get Jong Kook's name.

1301
01:10:25,170 --> 01:10:27,420
- You want me to get Jong Kook's name?
- No, Ji Sung. Don't do that.

1302
01:10:27,420 --> 01:10:28,720
[His next target is
Jong Kook's big name tag.]

1303
01:10:33,200 --> 01:10:35,610
Hey, Ji Sung.
Can't I kick just one step to this side?

1304
01:10:35,610 --> 01:10:37,370
Come on, you can't do that.

1305
01:10:37,370 --> 01:10:38,470
Challenge.

1306
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:44,230
[The ball is heading towards
Kim Jong Kook's big name tag!]

1307
01:10:46,300 --> 01:10:49,520
[So close!]

1308
01:10:49,520 --> 01:10:50,900
That's not very nice of you.

1309
01:10:51,860 --> 01:10:54,780
I have to get that.
I have to get that for it to be fun.

1310
01:10:55,240 --> 01:10:57,390
I'll take care of it being fun
on my own.

1311
01:10:57,450 --> 01:10:58,820
- Challenge.
- Go.

1312
01:11:00,530 --> 01:11:02,540
- You don't know where Ji Hyo is?
- No.

1313
01:11:02,540 --> 01:11:05,910
[All of Ji Sung's team having
found each other.]

1314
01:11:05,910 --> 01:11:08,230
- Ji Hyo went in the opposite direction.
- Really?

1315
01:11:08,230 --> 01:11:10,380
If I came this way...

1316
01:11:10,380 --> 01:11:13,560
then Ji Hyo went in the opposite direction
at a ninety degree angle.

1317
01:11:13,730 --> 01:11:17,060
I remember hearing her voice as
we were saying goodbye to each other.

1318
01:11:17,510 --> 01:11:20,190
- Then Sulli, why don't you stay here?
- She can't stay here, can she?

1319
01:11:20,200 --> 01:11:21,560
Guys...

1320
01:11:22,390 --> 01:11:24,410
- You have to stay alive.
- Of course, we will.

1321
01:11:24,420 --> 01:11:27,930
- Sulli, keep yourself hidden back here.
- Contact us if anything happens.

1322
01:11:28,710 --> 01:11:30,320
- Eliminate everyone.
- Okay.

1323
01:11:34,680 --> 01:11:36,090
I feel safe with all of them out there.

1324
01:11:37,560 --> 01:11:39,790
It's going to be really hard
to find Ji Hyo.

1325
01:11:39,790 --> 01:11:43,900
[Team Ji Sung out on their search
for Ji Hyo, the queen of Team Ja Chul.]

1326
01:11:58,460 --> 01:12:00,390
There's someone down there.

1327
01:12:01,880 --> 01:12:03,490
I see you hiding down there.

1328
01:12:03,490 --> 01:12:05,490
I can see you guys down there.

1329
01:12:05,490 --> 01:12:07,710
[What do we do?]

1330
01:12:10,020 --> 01:12:12,030
[Imminent face-off!]

1331
01:12:12,550 --> 01:12:15,330
[Sulli will be in danger
if they get through us!]

1332
01:12:18,300 --> 01:12:20,230
[We're outnumbered!]

1333
01:12:20,230 --> 01:12:21,340
Come and get us!

1334
01:12:22,620 --> 01:12:24,860
[The chase is on!]

1335
01:12:26,580 --> 01:12:30,390
[Team Ji Sung trying to use the fact that
they have more people to their advantage!]

1336
01:12:33,180 --> 01:12:35,950
[Facing off in a
wide open space.]

1337
01:12:37,260 --> 01:12:40,090
[A menacing move from Ja Chul!]

1338
01:12:40,090 --> 01:12:42,170
Look at his moves.

1339
01:12:44,030 --> 01:12:46,000
- He looks menacing.
- Ja Chul has the big name tag.

1340
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,680
[Ja Chul has the big name tag...]

1341
01:12:51,790 --> 01:12:54,570
[Corralling Ja Chul and Giraffe
back into a corner.]

1342
01:12:57,660 --> 01:13:00,220
[Ja Chul initiating an attack on Jae Suk?]

1343
01:13:00,220 --> 01:13:02,300
[Just then!]

1344
01:13:02,300 --> 01:13:04,730
[Kwang Soo's back is exposed!]

1345
01:13:11,390 --> 01:13:13,940
[Kwang Soo's name tag is eliminated
in the blink of an eye!]

1346
01:13:13,950 --> 01:13:16,070
[How can this be...]

1347
01:13:18,340 --> 01:13:19,710
Get him!
Get Ja Chul!

1348
01:13:19,710 --> 01:13:22,820
[Team Ji Sung seizing this chance
to chase down Ja Chul!]

1349
01:13:27,120 --> 01:13:28,830
Wow, he's so fast!

1350
01:13:29,780 --> 01:13:32,160
[Literally having disappeared from
their sight in the blink of an eye!]

1351
01:13:33,310 --> 01:13:36,350
[Already having escaped their grasps!]

1352
01:13:37,570 --> 01:13:40,030
[Having left his own VJ behind as well
to make his escape on his own.]

1353
01:13:44,440 --> 01:13:47,370
[Ja Chul had ten years
shaved off of his life.]

1354
01:13:48,100 --> 01:13:50,940
Jong Kook needs to get
in here quickly.

1355
01:13:53,830 --> 01:13:59,270
<i>Kim Jong Kook of Team Gu Ja Chul
makes his entrance.</i>

1356
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,670
<i>Kim Jong Kook of Team Gu Ja Chul
makes his entrance.</i>

1357
01:14:03,420 --> 01:14:04,840
Okay, we're all set now.

1358
01:14:04,840 --> 01:14:06,190
We're all set.

1359
01:14:07,880 --> 01:14:11,460
[Mr. Capable, Jong Kook!]

1360
01:14:12,860 --> 01:14:15,770
[Huh?
That's a giant sized name tag?]

1361
01:14:15,770 --> 01:14:18,910
Just look at you.
You can no longer say anything to me.

1362
01:14:18,910 --> 01:14:21,410
What else as I supposed to do when
Ji Sung kept targeting me like this?

1363
01:14:21,410 --> 01:14:22,650
[How did Jong Kook get to make his
entrance with that on his back?]

1364
01:14:22,650 --> 01:14:24,980
- I think I can get it next time. Seriously.
- Challenge.

1365
01:14:25,890 --> 01:14:27,620
- I'll get Ji Sung's.
- No!

1366
01:14:27,620 --> 01:14:29,090
No!

1367
01:14:33,440 --> 01:14:35,580
[And thus...]

1368
01:14:35,580 --> 01:14:39,460
[With the gigantic name tag on his back...]

1369
01:14:43,570 --> 01:14:45,440
Ja Chul, where are you?

1370
01:14:46,340 --> 01:14:47,790
I'm right here.

1371
01:14:47,790 --> 01:14:49,300
- Ja Chul!
- I'm right here.

1372
01:14:50,760 --> 01:14:54,170
- What do we do? My name tag is big too.
- Ji Sung did it, didn't he?

1373
01:14:54,170 --> 01:14:56,430
That Ji Sung.
He kept targeting me.

1374
01:14:58,380 --> 01:15:01,330
Ji Hyo is down that way.
That's where she's hiding.

1375
01:15:01,330 --> 01:15:04,090
[Telling Jong Kook where their
queen is hiding out first.]

1376
01:15:04,090 --> 01:15:07,070
- They're up on the third floor.
- Okay, I see them up there.

1377
01:15:07,070 --> 01:15:08,740
- I see them.
- I see all three of them up there.

1378
01:15:08,740 --> 01:15:10,540
Look at all three of them together.
We're in trouble.

1379
01:15:11,220 --> 01:15:13,870
- Look, they're together.
- They've found each other.

1380
01:15:13,870 --> 01:15:15,130
[Verifying that Jong Kook
and Ja Chul have found each other.]

1381
01:15:17,260 --> 01:15:21,230
Go Ja Chul and Jong Kook
have already found each other.

1382
01:15:21,230 --> 01:15:22,820
Make sure that you keep yourself
very well hidden.

1383
01:15:22,830 --> 01:15:24,100
<i>Okay.</i>

1384
01:15:26,530 --> 01:15:29,370
Those three guys walking
around together...

1385
01:15:29,970 --> 01:15:31,540
They're so cute!

1386
01:15:32,370 --> 01:15:34,460
They can't even approach
the other team.

1387
01:15:35,690 --> 01:15:39,830
- Are they on the fourth floor?
- Gu Ja Chul and Jong Kook together is scary.

1388
01:15:39,830 --> 01:15:41,240
[Even the sight of them together
is enough to frighten them.]

1389
01:15:41,240 --> 01:15:43,360
<i>Team Park Ji Sung's
Park Ji Sung making his entrance.</i>

1390
01:15:43,360 --> 01:15:45,720
- Okay.
- They're on the third floor now.

1391
01:15:45,720 --> 01:15:47,450
Jong Kook is on the third floor now.

1392
01:15:48,130 --> 01:15:50,900
[At last...]

1393
01:15:50,900 --> 01:15:56,370
[He... is here!]

1394
01:15:56,370 --> 01:15:57,540
Challenge.

1395
01:16:04,380 --> 01:16:06,710
[Kicking...]

1396
01:16:06,710 --> 01:16:10,940
[His own small name tag!]

1397
01:16:13,560 --> 01:16:19,340
[His class... everlasting.]

1398
01:16:20,550 --> 01:16:22,290
Bye, Suk Jin!

1399
01:16:22,750 --> 01:16:25,920
[Who's going to send me in?]

1400
01:16:26,600 --> 01:16:28,370
Jae Suk.
Where are you, Jae Suk?

1401
01:16:29,250 --> 01:16:31,950
We're on the third floor.
I think they're looking for you right now.

1402
01:16:31,950 --> 01:16:34,690
- You're on the third floor?
- They're on the second floor right now.

1403
01:16:35,110 --> 01:16:36,610
Is this the second floor?

1404
01:16:41,780 --> 01:16:43,020
It's Ji Sung.

1405
01:16:45,450 --> 01:16:48,050
[Ji Sung is right by them!]

1406
01:16:48,050 --> 01:16:51,230
- Where on the third floor?
- Ji Sung! You can't go that way!

1407
01:16:51,230 --> 01:16:54,590
Go to the right.
You have to go to the right.

1408
01:16:54,590 --> 01:16:57,490
- Over to the right!
- You have to move over to your right!

1409
01:16:57,490 --> 01:16:59,190
Right here!
We're right here!

1410
01:17:04,760 --> 01:17:06,460
We have to go after him!

1411
01:17:06,460 --> 01:17:08,860
[Team Ja Chul on the chase!]

1412
01:17:10,250 --> 01:17:12,780
Ji Sung, you have to run!
Run!

1413
01:17:12,780 --> 01:17:14,180
[Team Ja Chul on his chase!]

1414
01:17:15,550 --> 01:17:18,120
[Must hurry to help Ji Sung!]

1415
01:17:18,120 --> 01:17:20,830
<i>Ji Sung, you have to run!
Run!</i>

1416
01:17:22,550 --> 01:17:26,050
[Capture Park Ji Sung!]

1417
01:17:28,060 --> 01:17:29,460
No, Jong Kook!

1418
01:17:30,990 --> 01:17:33,610
[Ji Sung being clever and
escaping up the emergency stairs!]

1419
01:17:35,150 --> 01:17:38,140
[All of Team Ji Sung is now
gathered together!]

1420
01:17:39,130 --> 01:17:41,290
- They all have big name tags.
- Really?

1421
01:17:41,290 --> 01:17:43,990
Jong Kook and Ja Chul both
have big name tags on.

1422
01:17:43,990 --> 01:17:46,510
[Revealing that Jong Kook and
Ja Chul both have big name tags on!]

1423
01:17:49,650 --> 01:17:52,730
[Then shall we go face them?]

1424
01:17:52,730 --> 01:17:55,240
- There they are.
- They're looking at us right now.

1425
01:17:58,590 --> 01:18:00,560
I feel so much better with
you here, Jong Kook.

1426
01:18:01,160 --> 01:18:02,480
There they are.

1427
01:18:04,140 --> 01:18:06,780
I see them together.
They're all together right now.

1428
01:18:06,780 --> 01:18:08,850
I heard that you both have
big name tags on your back?

1429
01:18:10,290 --> 01:18:12,790
I'm sorry to tell you this,
but Suk Jin's still kicking out there.

1430
01:18:13,860 --> 01:18:15,940
I don't think Suk Jin is
going to make it in here tonight.

1431
01:18:15,940 --> 01:18:17,870
It's four against two right now.

1432
01:18:18,410 --> 01:18:20,240
But why am I still so scared?

1433
01:18:23,610 --> 01:18:25,690
They can't approach us very easily
right now because there are four of us here.

1434
01:18:25,690 --> 01:18:27,950
[Even though there are just two of them,
they're still a dangerous duo.]

1435
01:18:28,850 --> 01:18:31,110
- Where's Ji Hyo?
- We have to protect Ji Hyo.

1436
01:18:31,110 --> 01:18:36,330
[But the chances of winning with
their big name tags is...]

1437
01:18:37,410 --> 01:18:39,180
[Jong Kook...]

1438
01:18:39,180 --> 01:18:42,870
[Let's make a run for it and
go find Sulli!]

1439
01:18:50,260 --> 01:18:51,440
Okay, let's go.

1440
01:18:51,440 --> 01:18:53,010
Go up.
Let's go up.

1441
01:18:53,010 --> 01:18:56,720
[Their best bet in their situation is to
go find the other queen, Sulli!]

1442
01:18:56,720 --> 01:18:57,900
They ran away.

1443
01:19:00,070 --> 01:19:01,570
They can't find Sulli.

1444
01:19:02,850 --> 01:19:04,160
They're on the fourth floor right now.

1445
01:19:04,160 --> 01:19:09,290
Sulli, they're looking for you right now,
so keep yourself well hidden.

1446
01:19:09,290 --> 01:19:10,580
Okay.

1447
01:19:12,330 --> 01:19:14,760
I don't think this is going to work.
We have to go after them.

1448
01:19:17,050 --> 01:19:19,260
- I feel so bad for Suk Jin.
- Why?

1449
01:19:19,260 --> 01:19:21,030
He's still out there kicking the balls.

1450
01:19:21,030 --> 01:19:22,930
Suk Jin is still out there?

1451
01:19:23,970 --> 01:19:26,870
- What's he still doing out there?
- After I sent Jong Kook in...

1452
01:19:26,870 --> 01:19:28,860
I got my own name and just
came in here.

1453
01:19:32,720 --> 01:19:33,980
Challenge.

1454
01:19:38,250 --> 01:19:39,870
I'm at least kicking it
in the right direction now.

1455
01:19:39,880 --> 01:19:41,040
Challenge.

1456
01:19:52,200 --> 01:19:54,380
It's not like I'm preparing to
go out in any competition here.

1457
01:19:56,170 --> 01:19:59,180
[If I had studied this hard
when I was younger...]

1458
01:20:01,020 --> 01:20:02,190
Yoo Jae Suk.

1459
01:20:03,710 --> 01:20:05,730
I can do it!

1460
01:20:06,010 --> 01:20:08,220
- We have to switch out our tape.
- Okay.

1461
01:20:09,260 --> 01:20:10,780
Hit the slate.

1462
01:20:10,780 --> 01:20:11,850
What?

1463
01:20:12,890 --> 01:20:15,210
One, two, three.

1464
01:20:16,110 --> 01:20:17,930
Did you use up all your tape?

1465
01:20:20,980 --> 01:20:22,870
[With a fresh roll of tape
and new determination.]

1466
01:20:29,330 --> 01:20:30,950
[I'm going to lose my mind!]

1467
01:20:32,590 --> 01:20:35,600
[Oh... oh!]

1468
01:20:37,040 --> 01:20:40,580
[Team Ja Chul's Suk Jin hits his own
big name tag on the mark!]

1469
01:20:40,580 --> 01:20:42,960
Why does it have to be that one?

1470
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:46,410
Why does it have to be that one?
I don't know if I should be happy or not.

1471
01:20:47,670 --> 01:20:51,260
[Even the staff members who've been bored
out of their minds cheer in excitement.]

1472
01:20:52,100 --> 01:20:53,490
Ji Suk Jin!

1473
01:20:53,490 --> 01:20:55,070
[Set Team finally able to go home!]

1474
01:20:55,070 --> 01:20:58,490
Ji Suk Jin! But I really
don't know if I should be happy.

1475
01:20:58,490 --> 01:21:00,930
Wow... of all the name tags,
I can't believe I got that one.

1476
01:21:00,930 --> 01:21:02,420
[Team Ji Chul's Suk Jin finally gets to
enter with his big name tag.]

1477
01:21:02,420 --> 01:21:04,890
<i>Ji Suk Jin of Team Gu Ja Chul
makes his entrance.</i>

1478
01:21:04,890 --> 01:21:06,390
I finally did it.

1479
01:21:06,390 --> 01:21:08,370
<i>Ji Suk Jin of Team Gu Ja Chul
makes his entrance.</i>

1480
01:21:10,230 --> 01:21:12,060
- Suk Jin!
- Where are you?

1481
01:21:12,590 --> 01:21:14,050
Where do I need to go?

1482
01:21:15,400 --> 01:21:16,750
You have to be careful.

1483
01:21:16,750 --> 01:21:19,030
Suk Jin, they're all lying in ambush.
You have to be careful.

1484
01:21:19,030 --> 01:21:21,170
They're all lying in ambush.
I'm coming down. Just wait there.

1485
01:21:22,550 --> 01:21:24,520
You have to be careful!

1486
01:21:24,520 --> 01:21:26,540
They're coming down?

1487
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,090
[Message crossed.]

1488
01:21:39,590 --> 01:21:42,850
[Ji Sung's team having waited in ambush!]

1489
01:21:42,850 --> 01:21:45,740
[Starts to chase down the Impala!]

1490
01:21:45,740 --> 01:21:48,060
Run, Ji Sung!
Run!

1491
01:21:53,030 --> 01:21:54,980
[Ji Sung is hot on his heels!]

1492
01:21:57,800 --> 01:22:01,930
[Moving in on Big-nosed Brother
before he even notices it!]

1493
01:22:05,730 --> 01:22:07,950
[Barely escapes the attack!]

1494
01:22:09,240 --> 01:22:12,250
[Getting attacked...
from every which direction!]

1495
01:22:12,250 --> 01:22:14,080
I just got in!
I just got in here!

1496
01:22:14,080 --> 01:22:16,190
Please, Ji Sung!

1497
01:22:16,190 --> 01:22:17,640
I just got in here.

1498
01:22:17,640 --> 01:22:20,530
I just got in here after kicking
the ball for the past two hours!

1499
01:22:20,760 --> 01:22:23,390
[Poor thing...]

1500
01:22:23,390 --> 01:22:25,390
I just got in here.

1501
01:22:25,390 --> 01:22:28,210
I've been kicking out there
for two hours, Ji Sung.

1502
01:22:28,210 --> 01:22:30,800
- Are your legs okay?
- My legs won't stop shaking.

1503
01:22:31,410 --> 01:22:35,080
- I just got in here.
- And that's what you wore in here?

1504
01:22:35,080 --> 01:22:36,800
That's what I kicked.

1505
01:22:37,010 --> 01:22:40,690
<i>Ji Suk Jin, out.
Ji Suk Jin, out.</i>

1506
01:22:40,690 --> 01:22:42,230
Wow, that's too funny.

1507
01:22:42,230 --> 01:22:43,800
Ji Sung...

1508
01:22:43,800 --> 01:22:46,270
I can barely walk as is right now.

1509
01:22:46,940 --> 01:22:49,970
How could you have eliminated me
when I can barely even walk right now?

1510
01:22:50,850 --> 01:22:52,610
- Did you see him run?
- You really are...

1511
01:22:53,080 --> 01:22:54,370
I'm sorry.

1512
01:22:54,880 --> 01:22:57,230
- I'm going to get some rest now.
- Ji Suk Jin, as soon as he enters...

1513
01:22:57,910 --> 01:23:01,670
<i>Ji Suk Jin, out.
Ji Suk Jin, out.</i>

1514
01:23:03,010 --> 01:23:06,760
<i>Ji Suk Jin, out.
Ji Suk Jin, out.</i>

1515
01:23:13,500 --> 01:23:15,050
- Ha Ha.
- Yes?

1516
01:23:15,050 --> 01:23:16,950
Why don't you take Sulli and hide?

1517
01:23:16,950 --> 01:23:18,860
I'll come find you later.

1518
01:23:18,860 --> 01:23:20,660
Okay, then let's do this.

1519
01:23:20,660 --> 01:23:23,600
Hiding team, search team,
and attack team.

1520
01:23:24,190 --> 01:23:27,470
But Gary... you have to eliminate Ji Hyo
as soon as you see her.

1521
01:23:27,470 --> 01:23:28,820
Okay, I got it.

1522
01:23:28,820 --> 01:23:30,470
You have to promise me.

1523
01:23:30,470 --> 01:23:32,820
- You can't weaken your heart.
- You think I can do it?

1524
01:23:32,820 --> 01:23:34,990
You have to do it instead of
asking me if you can.

1525
01:23:34,990 --> 01:23:36,090
I have to get my mind straight.

1526
01:23:36,090 --> 01:23:37,990
- You really have to eliminate her.
- Okay, I will.

1527
01:23:39,500 --> 01:23:42,040
- Gary, you have to eliminate Ji Hyo, okay?
- Okay.

1528
01:23:42,750 --> 01:23:45,620
- I can do it, don't you think?
- Of course.

1529
01:23:47,390 --> 01:23:50,490
Since we're out there looking for Ji Hyo,
but that Gary...

1530
01:23:50,490 --> 01:23:52,030
I don't know if Gary will be able to
eliminate her though.

1531
01:23:52,030 --> 01:23:53,360
That's what I'm saying.

1532
01:23:53,360 --> 01:23:55,430
What if he loses his sight
in front of her again?

1533
01:23:56,870 --> 01:24:01,250
You, Kwang Soo or Suk Jin would be
perfect for a job like this.

1534
01:24:01,740 --> 01:24:04,020
Suk Jin never gives anyone a break.

1535
01:24:05,070 --> 01:24:06,660
Ji Hyo.

1536
01:24:07,780 --> 01:24:09,340
Song Ji Hyo.

1537
01:24:11,830 --> 01:24:14,130
Ji Hyo.

1538
01:24:15,520 --> 01:24:18,830
[Even the tone of his voice when calling out
her name is that of a lover...]

1539
01:24:21,720 --> 01:24:23,890
Ji Hyo.

1540
01:24:23,890 --> 01:24:25,320
[She's right behind that door!]

1541
01:24:26,080 --> 01:24:28,250
<i>Ji Hyo.</i>

1542
01:24:34,900 --> 01:24:36,450
I hear someone right by here.

1543
01:24:36,450 --> 01:24:38,600
Someone is here right now.

1544
01:24:38,600 --> 01:24:40,860
Someone come over here right now
and help me!

1545
01:24:44,720 --> 01:24:48,900
Ji Hyo.

1546
01:24:51,530 --> 01:24:54,690
- Kang Gary, are you here alone?
- Yeah, I'm here alone.

1547
01:24:56,590 --> 01:24:58,540
Are you going to eliminate me?

1548
01:24:59,700 --> 01:25:01,070
Are you going to eliminate me?

1549
01:25:01,070 --> 01:25:03,140
Hang on, I don't know what to do.

1550
01:25:03,140 --> 01:25:05,340
- Come here.
- Hang on.

1551
01:25:05,340 --> 01:25:07,040
Are you going to eliminate me right now?

1552
01:25:07,040 --> 01:25:09,340
If you keep asking me like that,
I don't know...

1553
01:25:09,340 --> 01:25:11,130
I don't know if I
can eliminate you anymore.

1554
01:25:11,130 --> 01:25:14,490
- Can you turn off the lights?
- Why are you turning the lights off?

1555
01:25:14,490 --> 01:25:16,900
Why are you trying to set the mood?

1556
01:25:16,900 --> 01:25:19,190
- Are you going to eliminate me?
- No, I'm not sure.

1557
01:25:19,470 --> 01:25:22,090
[Already looking discouraged.]

1558
01:25:22,090 --> 01:25:24,120
It's just the two of us right now.

1559
01:25:24,120 --> 01:25:26,820
I made a promise that I'd eliminate you
as soon as I saw you.

1560
01:25:26,830 --> 01:25:29,420
- Who did you make that promise to?
- With my team members.

1561
01:25:29,950 --> 01:25:31,900
Stop staring at me like that.

1562
01:25:31,900 --> 01:25:33,900
You're going to weaken my resolve.

1563
01:25:35,420 --> 01:25:39,540
[Who knew a situation like this
would come find them again?]

1564
01:25:42,110 --> 01:25:46,590
Do you remember that rainy day
out on the field a long time ago?

1565
01:25:47,100 --> 01:25:48,350
Yeah, I do.

1566
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:53,260
[This is the situation we were in...]

1567
01:25:54,520 --> 01:26:03,110
[The man who had to
capture the woman...]

1568
01:26:04,450 --> 01:26:08,020
[The woman who begged for
the man to save her...]

1569
01:26:09,090 --> 01:26:10,480
You can't do this to me.

1570
01:26:10,480 --> 01:26:16,180
- Don't tell Jong Kook that I let you go.
- I'll tell him that I ran away from you.

1571
01:26:16,180 --> 01:26:18,460
You have to give me your
number, okay?

1572
01:26:18,840 --> 01:26:20,410
- Okay.
- Promise?

1573
01:26:20,410 --> 01:26:23,590
[And thus...]

1574
01:26:23,590 --> 01:26:29,430
[He set the woman...]

1575
01:26:29,430 --> 01:26:35,480
[Free on that day.]

1576
01:26:42,360 --> 01:26:47,060
[The first time that the man
self-sacrificed himself for the woman...]

1577
01:26:47,060 --> 01:26:48,900
Remember when I let you go?

1578
01:26:48,900 --> 01:26:50,360
- Remember?
- Yeah.

1579
01:26:51,130 --> 01:26:54,610
[The man caught in the
same dilemma once again...]

1580
01:26:58,140 --> 01:27:01,340
I've been hiding under here all this time
without even being able to lift up my head.

1581
01:27:01,340 --> 01:27:03,290
Why?
Have you even eaten yet?

1582
01:27:03,690 --> 01:27:06,810
You haven't even eaten yet?
[You all ate together earlier...]

1583
01:27:06,810 --> 01:27:08,460
I wish I could order you
some jjajangmyun or something.

1584
01:27:08,460 --> 01:27:11,410
Don't you think that if I were to eat here,
that I'd be totally caught?

1585
01:27:11,410 --> 01:27:13,660
But you still have to eat.

1586
01:27:14,070 --> 01:27:15,770
Listen, Ji Hyo.

1587
01:27:15,770 --> 01:27:20,470
[The man and the woman...
how will today end for them?]

1588
01:27:21,510 --> 01:27:22,870
[Hello?]

1589
01:27:24,220 --> 01:27:27,150
[Ja Chul arrives to help Ji Hyo!]

1590
01:27:27,150 --> 01:27:28,660
Wait, Ja Chul!

1591
01:27:28,660 --> 01:27:31,270
Ja Chul!
You, Song Ji Hyo!

1592
01:27:31,270 --> 01:27:32,780
[Sorry!]

1593
01:27:36,280 --> 01:27:38,660
[Gary of Team Ji Sung is eliminated!]

1594
01:27:38,660 --> 01:27:40,320
You should break up with her now.

1595
01:27:42,240 --> 01:27:44,720
You could've waited five minutes
to eliminate me!

1596
01:27:44,720 --> 01:27:47,260
She and I were talking about
our past memories!

1597
01:27:47,650 --> 01:27:50,350
<i>Gary, out.
Gary, out.</i>

1598
01:27:50,350 --> 01:27:52,050
- Where's Jong Kook?
- He's alone right now.

1599
01:27:52,050 --> 01:27:54,130
I have to go, Kang Gary.

1600
01:27:54,130 --> 01:27:56,100
- Forget it. I'm mad.
- Don't be mad.

1601
01:27:56,100 --> 01:27:59,090
It's always been like this.
For three and a half years now.

1602
01:28:01,110 --> 01:28:04,120
- Let's make up.
- Forget it. Not today.

1603
01:28:04,120 --> 01:28:06,120
Come here.
Let's make up.

1604
01:28:06,120 --> 01:28:09,990
Can you play the song that you played
for us the very first time?

1605
01:28:09,990 --> 01:28:15,120
- 'A woman that you can't break up with...'
- For three and a half years now?

1606
01:28:15,120 --> 01:28:18,030
[A man who can't leave that woman
for three and a half years now.]

1607
01:28:26,190 --> 01:28:28,120
- Where are they?
- We have to go over to the other side.

1608
01:28:28,120 --> 01:28:30,000
Over there.
You see them over there?

1609
01:28:30,890 --> 01:28:34,890
- I see them coming this way.
- It may be better to stay here.

1610
01:28:34,890 --> 01:28:37,570
Ji Hyo, the guys are here now,
so you have to stay hidden, okay?

1611
01:28:37,570 --> 01:28:38,900
[Contacting Ji Hyo to tell her
to stay deep in hiding.]

1612
01:28:38,940 --> 01:28:40,200
I'll go back to where I was earlier.

1613
01:28:51,520 --> 01:28:54,180
[A habit that he's formed since
having been on Running Man before.]

1614
01:28:54,640 --> 01:28:59,000
Ji Sung... did you see us on the sixth floor
when you were with Sulli earlier?

1615
01:29:00,120 --> 01:29:02,610
I saw you with Sulli.
I even made eye contact with her.

1616
01:29:02,610 --> 01:29:04,520
I saw her earlier up there.

1617
01:29:06,650 --> 01:29:08,660
- There's Jong Kook right there.
- Yeah, I see him.

1618
01:29:11,400 --> 01:29:13,150
You know I'm fast.

1619
01:29:14,930 --> 01:29:18,640
[Four of the strongest having
all gathered in one place.]

1620
01:29:20,030 --> 01:29:21,270
Hang on a second.

1621
01:29:21,270 --> 01:29:23,860
[Imminent battle]

1622
01:29:25,240 --> 01:29:28,060
Why are you always hiding in the corner
when you're the strongest of the bunch?

1623
01:29:28,850 --> 01:29:31,420
[This is the survival instincts of
being a Running Man.]

1624
01:29:32,540 --> 01:29:35,960
Why are you getting so startled?

1625
01:29:37,600 --> 01:29:40,410
[Ja Chul startling his senior, Ji Sung.]

1626
01:29:40,410 --> 01:29:41,770
I've never seen you act like that.

1627
01:29:42,280 --> 01:29:44,170
This little kid...

1628
01:29:44,940 --> 01:29:46,760
This little kid...

1629
01:29:47,290 --> 01:29:49,950
[Now that we get a better look,
he's a rigid senior?]

1630
01:29:51,220 --> 01:29:52,410
Ji Sung, you're funny.

1631
01:29:52,410 --> 01:29:54,680
Should we go and help them?

1632
01:29:54,680 --> 01:29:56,250
Maybe we should?

1633
01:30:03,720 --> 01:30:06,500
[Ji Sung vs. Ja Chul and
Jae Suk vs. Jong Kook!]

1634
01:30:06,500 --> 01:30:08,850
Be careful, Ja Chul!

1635
01:30:10,370 --> 01:30:11,870
Time.
Hang on.

1636
01:30:11,870 --> 01:30:13,810
These two guys look like they're
in a little kid fight or something.

1637
01:30:13,810 --> 01:30:16,510
What? I keep hearing
all the slapping noises.

1638
01:30:16,510 --> 01:30:18,450
What are you two guys doing?

1639
01:30:18,460 --> 01:30:20,690
What's all that noise?
Are you okay?

1640
01:30:20,700 --> 01:30:24,070
[Soccer players aren't very good at
using their hands...]

1641
01:30:24,070 --> 01:30:25,690
What's this that they're doing?

1642
01:30:27,140 --> 01:30:28,640
Give us some space.

1643
01:30:28,640 --> 01:30:30,650
Come on, give us some space.

1644
01:30:33,800 --> 01:30:35,320
Where are you...

1645
01:30:39,360 --> 01:30:41,580
[Ji Sung attacks Ja Chul!]

1646
01:30:41,950 --> 01:30:43,600
Ja Chul...

1647
01:30:45,800 --> 01:30:48,200
[Ji Sung now moves on to
attack Jong Kook!]

1648
01:30:52,500 --> 01:30:55,480
[Ji Sung gets a hold of
Jong Kook's name tag!]

1649
01:30:57,480 --> 01:31:00,100
[This time gets his hand on
Ja Chul's name tag!]

1650
01:31:06,300 --> 01:31:08,800
[Jae Suk and Jong Kook eliminates
each other simultaneously!]

1651
01:31:12,010 --> 01:31:13,420
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

1652
01:31:13,420 --> 01:31:14,890
Are you okay, Ja Chul?

1653
01:31:15,950 --> 01:31:18,840
[Jong Kook and Jae Suk
are both out!]

1654
01:31:19,680 --> 01:31:22,630
[Team Ji Sung's survivors-
Ha Ha, Ji Sung, and Queen Sulli.]

1655
01:31:22,630 --> 01:31:25,950
[Team Ja Chul's survivors-
Ja Chul and Queen Ji Hyo.]

1656
01:31:26,540 --> 01:31:28,310
Ha Ha is still alive, isn't he?

1657
01:31:28,310 --> 01:31:30,100
You have to be careful.
You have to go right now!

1658
01:31:30,100 --> 01:31:32,710
You have to finish the battle
between you guys right now.

1659
01:31:32,710 --> 01:31:34,870
No, I have to oust Ha Ha first.

1660
01:31:34,880 --> 01:31:36,920
- Ha Ha.
- Go find Ji Hyo!

1661
01:31:36,920 --> 01:31:40,200
You have to oust Ha Ha.
You can't handle both of them by yourself.

1662
01:31:40,200 --> 01:31:41,330
[Ji Sung going off to find Ha Ha
to get his help.]

1663
01:31:43,320 --> 01:31:45,430
Ha Ha, where are you?

1664
01:31:46,230 --> 01:31:50,460
- Who got ousted?
- Ji Sung and Ha Ha are still alive.

1665
01:31:51,520 --> 01:31:53,170
- I'm the only one left.
- Really?

1666
01:31:55,060 --> 01:31:58,050
- Ja Chul... and Ji Hyo.
- That's it?

1667
01:31:58,050 --> 01:32:01,090
It's just the two of them left?
So it's three against two.

1668
01:32:01,090 --> 01:32:02,760
- They're on that side of the building.
- Really?

1669
01:32:02,760 --> 01:32:04,510
- They're over there.
- Let's go find them.

1670
01:32:04,510 --> 01:32:06,910
- We have to go find them first.
- I bet they're hiding right now.

1671
01:32:07,620 --> 01:32:09,750
We'll win as long as we eliminate Ji Hyo.

1672
01:32:09,750 --> 01:32:13,750
You and I together will grab her like this
and eliminate her.

1673
01:32:13,750 --> 01:32:15,360
Ji Hyo... our target is Ji Hyo.

1674
01:32:15,760 --> 01:32:18,520
Whatever Gu Ja Chul decides to do,
our goal remains Ji Hyo.

1675
01:32:18,520 --> 01:32:19,900
Okay.

1676
01:32:20,980 --> 01:32:23,110
Ja Chul, are you watching us right now?

1677
01:32:23,670 --> 01:32:25,160
Gu Ja Chul!

1678
01:32:27,400 --> 01:32:28,950
Are you watching us right now?

1679
01:32:37,370 --> 01:32:40,540
[All the survivors of both teams
coming face to face!]

1680
01:32:45,370 --> 01:32:46,930
Wow, this really is...

1681
01:32:46,930 --> 01:32:52,450
[Once the queen is ousted, it's game over!
Have to protect the queen no matter what!]

1682
01:32:53,920 --> 01:32:57,500
[Queen Ji Hyo is getting ready to
attack on her own behind Ja Chul.]

1683
01:32:57,500 --> 01:32:59,120
- Yeah, grab his arms.
- Be careful.

1684
01:33:00,790 --> 01:33:03,730
[Ji Sung and Ha Ha each grabbing
one of Ja Chul's arms!]

1685
01:33:04,450 --> 01:33:07,020
[Just then, Sulli moves in to
attack Ji Hyo?]

1686
01:33:08,940 --> 01:33:10,360
Hurry!
Hurry, Sulli!

1687
01:33:13,250 --> 01:33:15,580
[Ji Hyo turns and counterattacks Sulli!]

1688
01:33:16,660 --> 01:33:18,840
[Ja Chul rushes in to help,
but Ji Sung blocks him from moving in!]

1689
01:33:22,230 --> 01:33:24,400
[Even Ha Ha moves in to attack Ji Hyo!]

1690
01:33:36,630 --> 01:33:39,440
[Sulli eliminates Ji Hyo's name tag!]

1691
01:33:39,440 --> 01:33:41,590
[Team Ja Chul's Queen, Ji Hyo is ousted!]

1692
01:33:41,590 --> 01:33:43,710
That really won't come off!

1693
01:33:43,710 --> 01:33:46,150
I think he glued it on here
with superglue.

1694
01:33:46,150 --> 01:33:48,570
Oh, I guess it does come off.

1695
01:33:48,570 --> 01:33:50,530
[It looks like it falls off
easy enough to us...]

1696
01:33:50,530 --> 01:33:52,620
- What happened?
- What happened?

1697
01:33:52,620 --> 01:33:55,030
Those guys won.

1698
01:33:57,380 --> 01:33:59,980
[Protect the Queen-
Team Ji Sung wins!]

1699
01:33:59,990 --> 01:34:02,200
Ja Chul still didn't get ousted?

1700
01:34:02,200 --> 01:34:03,830
No, Ja Chul didn't get ousted.

1701
01:34:05,300 --> 01:34:09,780
Since Team Park Ji Sung won,
his team gets two nomination cards.

1702
01:34:09,780 --> 01:34:13,730
[Team Park Ji Sung wins two entrance cards
for having won the race.]

1703
01:34:13,730 --> 01:34:15,710
We should've won the race.

1704
01:34:15,710 --> 01:34:19,260
I can't believe Ja Chul came on the show when
he's getting married the day after tomorrow.

1705
01:34:19,260 --> 01:34:20,670
- Seriously.
- Thank you so much.

1706
01:34:20,670 --> 01:34:23,980
The Asian Dream Cup is the day after
the wedding...

1707
01:34:24,270 --> 01:34:27,850
But I won't be able to attend since
I'm getting married the day before

1708
01:34:27,850 --> 01:34:30,680
so I'm a little disappointed myself.

1709
01:34:30,680 --> 01:34:32,050
That is disappointing.

1710
01:34:32,580 --> 01:34:39,960
I really hope that everyone goes to support
Running Man and the team at the tournament.

1711
01:34:39,970 --> 01:34:42,040
That's our Captain Gu.

1712
01:34:43,640 --> 01:34:46,510
[The moment where the sincerity of
Captain Gu's love for soccer is felt.]

1713
01:34:46,520 --> 01:34:49,300
- He's very loyal.
- He is a great guy.

1714
01:34:49,300 --> 01:34:50,680
That is one loyal guy.

1715
01:34:50,680 --> 01:34:54,530
I really wish Ja Chul the happiest
of all marriages!

1716
01:34:54,530 --> 01:34:56,770
[Congratulations on your nuptials!]

1717
01:34:58,260 --> 01:35:01,770
Everyone will now head off to the airport.
Off you go!

1718
01:35:01,770 --> 01:35:05,070
[Off to 2013 Asian Dreamcup in Shanghai!]

1719
01:35:05,070 --> 01:35:07,110
Running Man, fighting.
Gu Ja Chul, fighting!

1720
01:35:07,110 --> 01:35:08,660
One, two, three!
