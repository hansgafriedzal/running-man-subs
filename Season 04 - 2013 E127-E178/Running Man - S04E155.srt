[That they weren't prepared for...]

8
00:00:26,731 --> 00:00:28,594
I'm so sick and tired of this life.

- If more than three people gather...
- I think we're all going to die.

doing Running Man.

I saw who it was.

29
00:01:31,692 --> 00:01:35,201
The two of you are not
the fateful couple.

30
00:01:35,839 --> 00:01:39,847
[Had they known back then...]

31
00:01:41,829 --> 00:01:46,653
[Five years ago at Running Man High School.]

high school students.]

34

- There are eight seats here.

35
00:01:54,636 --> 00:01:57,402
Morning announcement says
that we can sit wherever we want.

- All the cool kids can sit over here.
- Everyone give me your attention.

39
00:02:05,223 --> 00:02:07,003
Are you the class leader?

40
00:02:07,004 --> 00:02:08,532
- I'm the class leader.
- Why are you the class leader?

41
00:02:09,522 --> 00:02:12,072
You're just a class giraffe
that our school is raising.

42
00:02:12,676 --> 00:02:14,301
What are you talking about?

43
00:02:14,302 --> 00:02:16,323
This seat is really comfortable.

44
00:02:16,324 --> 00:02:18,397
- You always sat in the back, didn't you?
- Hang on a minute.

45
00:02:18,398 --> 00:02:20,142
He always sits in the back.

46
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:22,556
- It's because he wants to nap in class.
- You should study more.

47
00:02:22,557 --> 00:02:25,060
I know, and I block the teacher from
seeing him sleeping in the back.

48
00:02:25,534 --> 00:02:29,061
- It's good to see you, Suk Jin.
- You still need to use formal speech with me.

49
00:02:29,772 --> 00:02:31,520
[Asking for formalities to be kept
even during the role playing.]

50
00:02:31,521 --> 00:02:33,717
Suk Jin, why are you the
same age as the teacher?

51
00:02:33,718 --> 00:02:35,640
He's a year younger than me.

52
00:02:37,212 --> 00:02:40,232
My wish is to finally
graduate from this school.

53
00:02:42,036 --> 00:02:44,700
What's going on here today?
There aren't any girl students in here.

54
00:02:44,701 --> 00:02:47,242
- One of those seats are Ji Hyo's.
- But only one of them are Ji Hyo's.

55
00:02:47,243 --> 00:02:49,069
- But that still leaves one seat open.
- One of them is going to be Ji Hyo.

56
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:50,934
I bet it's a race to become a couple.

57
00:02:58,993 --> 00:03:01,412
- This is an all-boys school.
- Hurry up and sit down in your seat.

58
00:03:01,413 --> 00:03:02,911
- Hurry up and sit down.
- Don't you know what time it is?

59
00:03:02,912 --> 00:03:04,566
Hey, be quiet.
She's the ruler of this school.

60
00:03:04,567 --> 00:03:07,183
- I'm a new transfer student here.
- What did you say?

61
00:03:07,184 --> 00:03:10,098
- I'm a new transfer student.
- No, you're not. We saw you last week.

62
00:03:10,099 --> 00:03:13,917
- Guys, say 'hi' to the new student.
- Hey, I don't want you to say 'hi' to me.

63
00:03:13,979 --> 00:03:16,103
- Go sit back down.
- Just come back here.

64
00:03:16,104 --> 00:03:17,358
Don't talk to her.

65
00:03:17,359 --> 00:03:20,481
- Know when to talk to her.
- Gauge Ji Hyo's mood before you talk to her.

66
00:03:20,549 --> 00:03:21,933
- Are you the class leader?
- That's right.

67
00:03:21,934 --> 00:03:23,759
- Then I have something to say to you.
- What is it?

68
00:03:25,481 --> 00:03:27,414
What do you mean, get lost?

69
00:03:28,063 --> 00:03:29,707
You can't tell the
class leader to get lost!

70
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:32,066
[Class leader Giraffe being treated
more like the neighborhood dog.]

71
00:03:39,865 --> 00:03:43,403
- Are you going to keep being like that?
- Then be a better class leader!

72
00:03:44,235 --> 00:03:46,896
- That was so funny.
- That's such an old trick.

73
00:03:46,897 --> 00:03:48,899
I haven't had that trick
played on me in so long.

74
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:52,143
- And there's one more transfer student.
- What? Really?

75
00:03:52,144 --> 00:03:53,712
[Another transfer student?]

76
00:03:56,869 --> 00:04:03,346
[Another transfer student that will set
the hearts of male students racing.]

77
00:04:03,721 --> 00:04:05,655

- My name is Suzy.
- I know!

88
00:04:37,028 --> 00:04:38,957
I've seen you on TV!

89
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:41,891
- Please take good care of me.
- I saw you kissing Lee Seung Gi!

90
00:04:43,197 --> 00:04:44,701
Look at her acting shy.

- She hasn't decided yet.

94
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:56,198
- Come here, Suzy.
- Where do you want to sit, Suzy?

[Which seat will these girls take?]

96
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:00,128
Come here, Suzy.

[Anticipation]

98
00:05:14,207 --> 00:05:16,147
[Chooses the second group.]

99
00:05:17,435 --> 00:05:19,171
Why?
Why?

100
00:05:19,172 --> 00:05:21,155
[A mixture of joy and sorrow
in the classroom.]

101
00:05:21,627 --> 00:05:24,909
- My name is Yoo Jae Suk.
- School no longer seems as fun.

102
00:05:27,239 --> 00:05:29,157
What a pretty laugh she has.

103
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:32,361
- That's such nice laughter.
- Why don't you smile a little too?

104
00:05:33,383 --> 00:05:36,061
- Hey!
- I told you not to talk to me.

105
00:05:36,883 --> 00:05:38,585
- Quiet.

[Homeroom Teacher Go
makes his entrance.]

107
00:05:41,347 --> 00:05:43,876
Why are you boys
so full of chatter this morning?

00:05:43,877 --> 00:05:46,522
- Is he our teacher?
- Attention!

109
00:05:46,523 --> 00:05:48,232
Quiet.
You're the loudest one of the bunch.

110
00:05:50,166 --> 00:05:51,420
Okay.

111
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,314
Okay, roll call.

112
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:56,053
Hmm... I see that you're all here.

113
00:05:58,132 --> 00:05:59,758
You're not up to anything, are you?

114
00:06:01,525 --> 00:06:05,073
I'm not in the best mood today,
so we're only going to do the morning class.

115
00:06:08,499 --> 00:06:11,281
- Teacher Go, who's your first love?
- Be quiet.

116
00:06:11,316 --> 00:06:14,578
Okay, we are going to be playing
the Fourth Period Graduation Race today.

00:06:15,207 --> 00:06:18,346
Once you complete your fourth period,
you can graduate.

118
00:06:18,376 --> 00:06:20,452
- It'll be a great...
- Am I finally going to get to graduate?

119
00:06:20,453 --> 00:06:22,349
- Wow, finally!
- Congratulations.

120
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:29,403
<i>Every time you win a game,
you will be given a pair of running shoes.</i>

121
00:06:29,404 --> 00:06:35,169
<i>The first team to cross the finish line
with everyone wearing the shoes will win.</i>

122
00:06:36,481 --> 00:06:39,312
Are we not going to be able to run the field
if we don't have running shoes on?

123
00:06:39,313 --> 00:06:41,860
Okay, as for the field...

124
00:06:44,599 --> 00:06:47,095
- Teacher, Go, I have a question.
- Ji Hyo has a question.

125
00:06:47,096 --> 00:06:48,987
You have to answer the question.

126
00:06:48,988 --> 00:06:51,721
- Why aren't you answering the question?
- It could be very important.

127
00:06:52,307 --> 00:06:54,657
Your teams will be divided
in the group that you're in.

128
00:06:54,658 --> 00:06:56,475
Group one will be one team.

129
00:06:56,476 --> 00:06:58,253
And then group two will be a team.

130
00:06:58,254 --> 00:07:00,407
- I knew that was going to happen.
- Pretty simple, right?

131
00:07:00,408 --> 00:07:03,893
- I'm on the same team with Jae Suk?
- I like that Suzy's here, but Jong Kook?

132
00:07:03,894 --> 00:07:06,415
[The two worst naggers, Jae Suk
and Jong Kook are on the same team.]

133
00:07:06,416 --> 00:07:09,441
I'm stuck right in the middle of them.

134
00:07:09,442 --> 00:07:13,797
[First period-
The Law of the Parabola.]

135
00:07:18,588 --> 00:07:21,056
- What is this?
- What does that say?

136
00:07:21,057 --> 00:07:22,678
[First period is outdoor phys ed.]

137
00:07:22,679 --> 00:07:24,976
- The law of the parabola?
- What does that mean?

138
00:07:25,232 --> 00:07:26,902
I think we're supposed to
put something in there.

139
00:07:26,903 --> 00:07:31,326
Use the law of parabola to leverage
a 45 degree angle off the ground

140
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:33,969
to throw your slipper and land it
inside the shoe slot with your name on it.

141
00:07:34,597 --> 00:07:37,692
[A scientific game utilizing
the law of parabola.]

142
00:07:41,929 --> 00:07:43,977
What if we land the shoe in a slot
with someone else's name on it?

143
00:07:43,978 --> 00:07:45,664
- Then it doesn't count.
- It doesn't count?

144
00:07:45,665 --> 00:07:49,288
Suzy's name up there looks like
the name of some country.

145
00:07:49,289 --> 00:07:51,900
- Isn't there a country with a similar name?
- No.

146
00:07:51,901 --> 00:07:53,041
- Yes, there is.
- No, there isn't.

147
00:07:53,042 --> 00:07:55,619
- I'm sure that there is.
- Then what about Lee Kwang Soo's name?

148
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:57,909
Lee Kwang Soo?
Some body of water?

149
00:07:59,099 --> 00:08:01,666
Where do we have to stand?
Over here?

150
00:08:01,667 --> 00:08:03,570
Who don't you go home and do it from there?

151
00:08:04,073 --> 00:08:06,162
Then give me a camera!
I'll take a cameraman home and do it there.

152
00:08:06,163 --> 00:08:09,609
- Why do you have to be like that?
- I hate being stuck between them.

153
00:08:10,327 --> 00:08:11,793
Okay, Gary.

154
00:08:11,794 --> 00:08:13,656
[Gary is the first to start.]

155
00:08:23,585 --> 00:08:26,387
[Random Mr. Capable shows surprising skills
even though it was someone else's slot.]

156
00:08:26,388 --> 00:08:27,960
- Gary's good at things like this.
- He's got the feel for it.

157
00:08:27,961 --> 00:08:31,359
- You can't kick it off too high.
- You have to kick it low.

158
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,579
- Don't step on the line.
- The release time is important.

159
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:36,390
- You have to release it low to the ground.
- He's so loud.

160
00:08:36,922 --> 00:08:39,425
You'd better be quiet before I kick my
shoe off and land it in your mouth.

161
00:08:41,426 --> 00:08:42,918
It's going to head your way.

162
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:44,955
If you don't want to
go to this school anymore...

163
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:47,360
I'll make it so that you don't go to
this school anymore.

164
00:08:47,822 --> 00:08:49,306
What did you say?

165
00:08:49,307 --> 00:08:52,878
[Battle of wills between Kkuk and Yoo Hyuk
with no sign of concession from either side.]

166
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:54,576
You're going to graduate while
in a hospital bed.

167
00:08:57,555 --> 00:08:59,514
I told you not to do that!

168
00:08:59,883 --> 00:09:01,853
You needed to kick from this level.

169
00:09:02,503 --> 00:09:04,019
Okay.

170
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:06,333
It's Suzy's turn!

171
00:09:07,121 --> 00:09:10,426
- Suzy!
- Suzy!

172
00:09:10,427 --> 00:09:14,415
- You can't kick it off too high.
- That's what I said.

173
00:09:16,459 --> 00:09:18,677
You should be able to do it since
you're good at martial arts.

174
00:09:24,299 --> 00:09:26,612
[The shoe goes flying off her foot in
a straight and lightning fast manner.]

175
00:09:27,012 --> 00:09:28,817
- That's the move, Suzy.
- That was it.

176
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:30,689
Show them what you've got, Kwang Soo.

177
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:31,961
Okay, I'll take my turn.

178
00:09:33,778 --> 00:09:35,848
He doesn't look like he'd be
any good at it.

179
00:09:35,849 --> 00:09:38,113
[Huh?]

180
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:41,571
No, I didn't do anything.

181
00:09:41,572 --> 00:09:46,058
[Self-proclaimed class leader, Giraffe-
Instigating a fight with Kkuk.]

182
00:09:48,547 --> 00:09:51,194
[Still eyes Kkuk as his target.]

183
00:09:51,195 --> 00:09:54,295
- You're asking for death.
- He's starting to get mad.

184
00:09:54,296 --> 00:09:57,171
- You really are asking for it.
- I wouldn't put it past him to do it.

185
00:09:57,172 --> 00:09:59,753
Everyone except for Jong Kook sit down.
This could get dangerous.

186
00:09:59,754 --> 00:10:02,018
[Giraffe warning every one
of his high kick.]

187
00:10:02,019 --> 00:10:04,812
- Why don't you sit down, Gary?
- I already warned you guys.

188
00:10:04,813 --> 00:10:07,072
This is just a game.
Enjoy it as a game.

189
00:10:07,073 --> 00:10:08,760
No, I don't want to do that.

190
00:10:09,686 --> 00:10:10,800
Challenge!

191
00:10:18,484 --> 00:10:20,383
[Low kick?]

192
00:10:20,384 --> 00:10:22,220
- I'm sorry, that was a mistake.
- Turn the cameras off.

193
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:29,783
- He asked for the cameras to be turned off.
- If they had, you'd really be in trouble.

194
00:10:29,784 --> 00:10:31,430
Thank you, camera men.

195
00:10:34,022 --> 00:10:35,157
Challenge.

196
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:37,924
- I think he's going to get it.
- Come on, Kwang Soo.

197
00:10:39,217 --> 00:10:40,513
Kwang Soo!

198
00:10:40,514 --> 00:10:42,490
[Flying above Suzy's head.]

199
00:10:44,354 --> 00:10:46,558
What are you doing?
Are you out of your mind?

200
00:10:47,683 --> 00:10:51,285
- You just almost hit Suzy.
- Suzy, I didn't hit you, did I?

201
00:10:51,571 --> 00:10:53,504
Do you want to leave this earth?

202
00:10:53,505 --> 00:10:56,501
[Looks as though his life may be
in danger after one wrong kick.]

203
00:10:56,589 --> 00:10:58,579
This is harder than I thought.

204
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:01,355
[Big-nosed Brother's turn.]

205
00:11:07,357 --> 00:11:10,921
[A perfect goal in!]

206
00:11:16,795 --> 00:11:18,769
- I can't believe you made it in!
- I got it in there.

207
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:21,519
Hey, Gary!
We win if you get it in.

208
00:11:21,724 --> 00:11:23,519
[If Random Mr. Capable, Gary succeeds...]

209
00:11:25,605 --> 00:11:27,124
There you go!

210
00:11:34,017 --> 00:11:37,397
[That was so close!]

211
00:11:39,081 --> 00:11:42,384
- Okay, we can still do this.
- Watch out for the door hinges on it.

212
00:11:42,385 --> 00:11:44,302
- Door hinge? Okay.
- You can do this.

213
00:11:45,848 --> 00:11:46,982
You got it.

214
00:11:48,814 --> 00:11:51,005
[Huh?]

215
00:11:51,006 --> 00:11:52,259
<i>[Ji Suk Jin]</i>

216
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:54,886
[A newborn couple?]

217
00:11:56,347 --> 00:11:58,383
- Confess your feelings for him.
- So it's been Suk Jin all along?

218
00:11:59,675 --> 00:12:02,115
Is that why you've been acting the
way you have for the past three years?

219
00:12:03,578 --> 00:12:06,550
- You have to kick your leg out straight.
- I know what I'm doing.

220
00:12:06,551 --> 00:12:09,099
- This is nerve-wrecking.
- You have to kick it in the right direction.

221
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,342
This is the way you're supposed to kick.

222
00:12:11,516 --> 00:12:13,831
[How will he do?]

223
00:12:15,595 --> 00:12:17,662
[Fail]

224
00:12:19,714 --> 00:12:23,635
[Bad enough for Suzy to condemn.]

225
00:12:25,111 --> 00:12:26,939
There are three teams here today.

226
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:29,407
There's the Blue Team, White Team,
and Kim Jong Kook.

227
00:12:29,408 --> 00:12:32,379
No, there are four teams here.
Team Yoo Jae Suk.

228
00:12:34,278 --> 00:12:35,708
Just hurry up and do it.

229
00:12:36,139 --> 00:12:38,134
It's not Team Yoo Jae Suk,
but it's Team Yoon Jae Suk and Suzy.

230
00:12:38,135 --> 00:12:40,801
What did you say?
Don't you know Team Suzy and Ha Ha?

231
00:12:41,344 --> 00:12:43,854
- We're a pretty well-known team.
- What did you say?

232
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:47,533
[Ha Ha taking his turn.]

233
00:12:52,075 --> 00:12:55,150
[A perfect goal!]

234
00:12:56,243 --> 00:12:57,443
You want to know how you do it?

235
00:12:57,444 --> 00:12:58,877
Stand over here.

236
00:12:58,878 --> 00:13:02,938
[Teaching a lesson to two Mr. Know-it-all's.]

237
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:08,008
- He just got lucky.
- One, two, three, kick. Try it.

238
00:13:08,586 --> 00:13:11,218
- You have to know to be humble.
- You just got lucky.

239
00:13:11,219 --> 00:13:12,990
What does being humble
have to do with anything?

240
00:13:12,991 --> 00:13:15,921
The team hasn't won yet. Your
own personal win isn't what's important.

241
00:13:15,922 --> 00:13:18,639
What do you mean, a personal win?
That was a win for the team.

242
00:13:21,136 --> 00:13:23,454
[Kang Gary's turn once again.]

243
00:13:23,866 --> 00:13:26,056
- Fighting!
- Ji Hyo usually cheers Gary on.

244
00:13:26,057 --> 00:13:28,064
- He's on the opposing team, Suzy.
- That's what I'm saying.

245
00:13:28,729 --> 00:13:30,063
It's okay, you can cheer me on.

246
00:13:30,064 --> 00:13:33,201
Why don't you aim for the space
right below Ji Hyo's? That's right!

247
00:13:33,202 --> 00:13:36,787
[A goal?]

248
00:13:45,176 --> 00:13:46,561
[Success]

249
00:13:46,562 --> 00:13:48,037
That's right!

250
00:13:49,969 --> 00:13:52,922
[Random Mr. Capable!]

251
00:13:52,923 --> 00:13:55,902
Gary! Gary!

252
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:59,306
I can't believe Gary made that.

253
00:14:00,012 --> 00:14:03,871
[Thanks to Gary, Random Mr. Capable,
Group Two earns their pair of shoes!]

254
00:14:03,872 --> 00:14:06,457
- Can we put them on right now?
- It's okay, we'll get the next one.

255
00:14:08,242 --> 00:14:10,604
<i>Second period is gym class.</i>

256
00:14:11,026 --> 00:14:13,823
<i>Please move on to Room Three
for the junior class.</i>

257
00:14:13,824 --> 00:14:15,200
What's this?

258
00:14:15,201 --> 00:14:17,420
I bet it's going to be arm wrestling.

259
00:14:17,421 --> 00:14:20,375
- It's arm wrestling?
- It's gym class.

260
00:14:20,977 --> 00:14:24,006
- Do you see what's written up there?
- Okay, it's couple arm wrestling.

261
00:14:24,007 --> 00:14:27,572
You have to take care of this
for our team.

262
00:14:27,573 --> 00:14:29,588
Finish this for us, Jong Kook.

263
00:14:30,024 --> 00:14:31,436
You're our champion.

264
00:14:31,437 --> 00:14:33,130
- Let's do this.
- Finish it.

265
00:14:33,628 --> 00:14:35,908
Fighting, Kim Jong Kook!

266
00:14:35,909 --> 00:14:37,814
Ji Hyo's really strong though.

267
00:14:38,448 --> 00:14:41,778
- It's important for the girl to win this.
- The man with thighs for arms.

268
00:14:41,779 --> 00:14:44,449
Ji Hyo's going to win this.

269
00:14:44,926 --> 00:14:48,234
I'll tell you a sure way of
winning this game.

270
00:14:48,235 --> 00:14:50,443
[Do it to me too.]

271
00:14:51,516 --> 00:14:54,231
- I really like him at times like this.
- I love having him for things like this.

272
00:14:54,232 --> 00:14:56,173
I like him a lot during games like this one
when he doesn't talk much.

273
00:14:56,174 --> 00:14:58,598
Teamwork is what's important
when it comes to games like this.

274
00:14:58,599 --> 00:15:02,153
- My thumb is stuck.
- This is a man with legs for arms.

275
00:15:02,157 --> 00:15:04,514
- Look at how his arms looks like thighs.
- This man has four legs.

276
00:15:04,515 --> 00:15:06,559
- What are you guys doing?
- I'm sorry.

277
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,677
Ready.

278
00:15:09,101 --> 00:15:11,255
I can tell that this game is
already over.

279
00:15:11,256 --> 00:15:12,760
[First round: Big-nose and Blank Ji
vs. Kkuk and Suzy.]

280
00:15:12,761 --> 00:15:14,610
[Start]

281
00:15:15,276 --> 00:15:17,533
- I don't know. It looks pretty close.
- He's smiling right now.

282
00:15:17,534 --> 00:15:19,943
Suzy's the one doing all the
work right now.

283
00:15:20,643 --> 00:15:22,276
- Let's do this, Suzy.
- You can do this, Ji Hyo.

284
00:15:22,277 --> 00:15:25,659
They're holding up better than I thought.
Suk Jin has to stick his arm closer.

285
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:27,203
You have to stick your arm up
right next to Ji Hyo's.

286
00:15:27,204 --> 00:15:30,092
See how your arms are spaced out?
You have to stick them up against each other.

287
00:15:30,093 --> 00:15:32,253
There you go.
That way I can beat you guys.

288
00:15:34,011 --> 00:15:38,219
[Ah... so he can beat them?]

289
00:15:40,317 --> 00:15:43,645
[Kkuk's one man stage show.]

290
00:15:43,646 --> 00:15:45,336
If they don't stick them together,
you can't push their arms down.

291
00:15:45,337 --> 00:15:48,039
- Can't someone else do this instead of him?
- No, we can't.

292
00:15:48,303 --> 00:15:51,455
- He's going to finish this for us.
- He's just too strong for us.

293
00:15:51,456 --> 00:15:52,615
He's going to finish this game.

294
00:15:54,331 --> 00:15:58,440
[Round Two: Gary and Blank Ji
vs. Kkuk and Suzy.]

295
00:15:58,441 --> 00:16:02,528
You have to beat Jong Kook,
and you have to finish Ha Ha too.

296
00:16:03,532 --> 00:16:05,198
Ready, set, go.

297
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:08,368
- That looks good. You can do this.
- This is a close call!

298
00:16:09,374 --> 00:16:12,193
[Monday Couple power!]

299
00:16:14,894 --> 00:16:17,250
[However...]

300
00:16:17,251 --> 00:16:19,498
- Stick them together... that way I'll win.
- Their arms are sticking together.

301
00:16:20,215 --> 00:16:23,918
[Even though they gave it their best...
still no chance of winning.]

302
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:30,300
- I'm not even needed in the game.
- It's all about the planning.

303
00:16:30,301 --> 00:16:32,576
Kim Jong Kook is going to
finish this up.

304
00:16:32,577 --> 00:16:34,959
Suzy's not even putting her
strength behind it.

305
00:16:36,319 --> 00:16:39,735
[Will Kkuk be able to finish them
all off on his own?]

306
00:16:39,736 --> 00:16:41,057
You can finish this.

307
00:16:42,317 --> 00:16:46,033
[The last hope for Group Two-
Self-proclaimed class leader, Giraffe.]

308
00:16:46,034 --> 00:16:48,807
It's like there's a building behind Suzy.
He's like the 63 building.

309
00:16:49,706 --> 00:16:51,187
There's no way to beat him.

310
00:16:52,521 --> 00:16:55,999
Once he wins this round,
it's an easy win after that.

311
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,902
- You can do this, Kwang Soo.
- Just look at Jong Kook in the eye.

312
00:16:58,903 --> 00:17:01,482
[Their plan is to attack Jong Kook by playing
on Jong Kook's weakness towards women?]

313
00:17:02,327 --> 00:17:05,693
Kim Jong Kook already has his wrist bent.
Look at this!

314
00:17:05,694 --> 00:17:09,304
[A fierce protest.]

315
00:17:09,305 --> 00:17:11,281
- I can't play like this!
- This isn't right!

316
00:17:11,282 --> 00:17:14,784
[Protesting loudly at his bent wrist
before the competition even starts.]

317
00:17:15,564 --> 00:17:18,529
Ji Hyo, I think you're being
too overly sensitive about this.

318
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:21,230
Look at how he had his wrist
already bent over like that!

319
00:17:22,812 --> 00:17:26,289
[Extremely angry Blank Ji.]

320
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:28,980
- You seem very angry, Ji Hyo.
- Giraffe had his wrist bent over too.

321
00:17:29,697 --> 00:17:32,164
[On the verge of Bully Ji Hyo
making her appearance.]

322
00:17:32,165 --> 00:17:34,644
- But he already had his wrist bent over.
- Her alter ego is coming out in that uniform.

323
00:17:35,402 --> 00:17:36,789
Okay, have a seat.

324
00:17:37,388 --> 00:17:39,006
Okay, let's end this quickly.

325
00:17:40,023 --> 00:17:41,300
Set, go.

326
00:17:41,301 --> 00:17:44,066
- That looks good.
- Don't let him beat you.

327
00:17:44,067 --> 00:17:46,845
- Put some strength into it.
- Just beat him.

328
00:17:49,478 --> 00:17:52,074
[Giraffe and Blank Ji using every ounce of
energy they have into beating him.]

329
00:17:53,798 --> 00:17:55,320
Here, get closer.

330
00:17:55,321 --> 00:17:56,790
[Huh?]

331
00:17:56,791 --> 00:17:58,191
That hurts!

332
00:17:58,192 --> 00:18:01,859
[Giraffe going after Kkuk's shoulders.]

333
00:18:03,047 --> 00:18:05,698
[But the 63 building isn't even budging.]

334
00:18:06,445 --> 00:18:08,321
Come on, fall down.
Fall down!

335
00:18:10,196 --> 00:18:11,323
Wait!

336
00:18:13,207 --> 00:18:14,387
Wait!

337
00:18:14,388 --> 00:18:16,633
[Kkuk and Suzy win again!]

338
00:18:17,428 --> 00:18:20,070
- Arm wrestling is the easiest to win!
- Suzy and Jong Kook wins!

339
00:18:20,071 --> 00:18:22,069
[An easy win for Group One!]

340
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:25,049
- This really... there's no way to beat him.
- This isn't a fair game.

341
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:28,377
- There's no way to beat him in this.
- No way.

342
00:18:28,869 --> 00:18:30,314
<i>No way.</i>

343
00:18:31,509 --> 00:18:35,853
[She said that there's no way...]

344
00:18:35,854 --> 00:18:39,440
[But this is still where she ends up.]

345
00:18:40,771 --> 00:18:44,723
[Just how did this happen?]

346
00:18:48,683 --> 00:18:52,017
[It's finally fourth period.]

347
00:18:53,859 --> 00:18:56,357
- What's this?
- HR?

348
00:18:56,373 --> 00:18:57,758
What's this?

349
00:18:57,759 --> 00:18:59,594
<i>[Personal belongings check.]</i>

350
00:18:59,595 --> 00:19:01,117
<i>[Hide all your personal belongings.]</i>

351
00:19:01,118 --> 00:19:02,182
<i>[Must find appropriate belonging
to oust the person.]</i>

352
00:19:02,182 --> 00:19:03,804
<i>[The team to oust the most people
wins the game.]</i>

353
00:19:03,804 --> 00:19:05,801
What's this?
We have to find what the other person hid?

354
00:19:09,897 --> 00:19:13,242
[Current count of the pairs of shoes won-
Group Two- 2 pairs, Group One- 3 pairs.]

355
00:19:14,084 --> 00:19:19,107
[All of the students working hard to hide
each of their personal belongings.]

356
00:19:19,108 --> 00:19:22,839
[Hiding them in secret so that
the other team can't find them.]

357
00:19:24,623 --> 00:19:29,789
[Ten minute personal belonging
treasure hunt starts now.]

358
00:19:31,215 --> 00:19:34,819
[Must find the personal belonging first
in order to eliminate their name tags.]

359
00:19:38,165 --> 00:19:40,625
The 'R' sticker is stuck on the item.

360
00:19:40,626 --> 00:19:44,123
['R' sticker and the name of the person whom
the item belongs to are affixed to the item.]

361
00:19:44,124 --> 00:19:47,033
<i>Could it be underneath the desk...</i>

362
00:19:56,229 --> 00:19:59,553
[Why is the self-proclaimed team leader
Giraffe staring at Suzy so intently?]

363
00:20:00,632 --> 00:20:03,119
[A few moments ago.]

364
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:11,926
[Having found an unbelievably clever place
to hide his own personal item.]

365
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:23,581
[He thought no one would
ever find it...]

366
00:20:24,415 --> 00:20:26,106
[What do I do?]

367
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:31,481
[Suzy fortunately only searches
through the lower racks?]

368
00:20:37,881 --> 00:20:40,828
[Closes the door out of nervousness.]

369
00:20:44,501 --> 00:20:45,932
Why is it so hard to find anything?

370
00:20:45,933 --> 00:20:47,913
It can't be in a garbage can, right?

371
00:20:49,765 --> 00:20:53,619
There are so many statues around.
Couldn't something be under one of these?

372
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:56,436
I know of a spot where there were tons of
bust statues that I saw earlier.

373
00:20:57,010 --> 00:20:58,256
Here it is.

374
00:20:58,796 --> 00:21:00,153
Here they are.

375
00:21:00,154 --> 00:21:03,084
[Rushing over to the very same room.]

376
00:21:05,421 --> 00:21:07,257
Seriously, what's with that guy?

377
00:21:08,615 --> 00:21:13,459
[That's where Kwang Soo's item is!]

378
00:21:15,563 --> 00:21:16,805
Jae Suk!

379
00:21:17,914 --> 00:21:21,374
[Making desperate efforts to
divert his attention away.]

380
00:21:23,142 --> 00:21:27,552
[Group Two made to feel anxious.]

381
00:21:30,884 --> 00:21:34,739
[Giraffe ultimately walking into
the secret hiding room.]

382
00:21:36,975 --> 00:21:38,790
What do you want?
What are you doing here?

383
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:44,850
[Ah...]

384
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:48,730
Run!

385
00:21:51,188 --> 00:21:53,436
[Discovers Kwang Soo's item!]

386
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:55,572
Look at him running away!

387
00:21:55,573 --> 00:21:56,897
Run away!

388
00:21:59,694 --> 00:22:01,456
Lee Kwang Soo.
Lee Kwang Soo!

389
00:22:02,618 --> 00:22:04,926
[Giraffe caught in the jar.]

390
00:22:10,169 --> 00:22:13,289
[Kkuk and Yoo Hyuk working together
to oust the Giraffe.]

391
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:16,749
[Self-proclaimed Kwang Soo is out!]

392
00:22:17,772 --> 00:22:19,936
What is he?
Is he a detective?

393
00:22:19,937 --> 00:22:23,838
[But little Kkuk grows up to be
a singer instead.]

394
00:22:23,839 --> 00:22:26,841
[Speechless]

395
00:22:34,425 --> 00:22:39,728
[All of the students disperse to
find other people's personal items.]

396
00:22:40,392 --> 00:22:42,291
Don't you think that
something would be in here?

397
00:22:42,291 --> 00:22:44,342
[A room that's perfect for hiding.]

398
00:22:50,455 --> 00:22:54,606
[Blank Ji searching through even
the smallest of containers.]

399
00:22:57,873 --> 00:23:00,465
[Discovers Jong Kook's personal item!]

400
00:23:01,585 --> 00:23:04,594
[Flustered Kkuk.]

401
00:23:11,433 --> 00:23:13,069
Come here!

402
00:23:14,907 --> 00:23:17,004
Gary, Suzy's by the front door!

403
00:23:17,565 --> 00:23:20,293
[Kkuk and Suzy keeping both of the doors
securely shut.]

404
00:23:20,294 --> 00:23:22,696
Dong Hoon.
Hurry up and find Gary's.

405
00:23:22,697 --> 00:23:24,503
Where am I supposed to find Gary's?

406
00:23:24,504 --> 00:23:26,258
Hurry up and find Gary's.

407
00:23:27,359 --> 00:23:31,459
[Group One's Kkuk is in danger!]

408
00:23:32,783 --> 00:23:36,147
[Blank Ji sneaking up to the front door.]

409
00:23:42,141 --> 00:23:44,487
Stop her, Suzy.
Keep Ji Hyo away from me.

410
00:23:44,488 --> 00:23:45,920
Grab Ji Hyo!

411
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:48,168
Hurry up and grab Ji Hyo.
Get Ji Hyo!

412
00:23:48,169 --> 00:23:50,056
Grab Ji Hyo!

413
00:23:53,722 --> 00:23:57,080
[Must hurry and find Gary's item!]

414
00:23:57,081 --> 00:23:58,395
Ji Hyo!

415
00:24:04,126 --> 00:24:05,584
I'm sorry, Suzy!

416
00:24:05,585 --> 00:24:07,116
I'm sorry, Suzy!

417
00:24:11,734 --> 00:24:13,016
I'm going to lose my mind.

418
00:24:16,701 --> 00:24:18,880
[Kkuk holding out desperately.]

419
00:24:22,353 --> 00:24:24,167
[This is where Gary's item is!]

420
00:24:26,927 --> 00:24:29,398
[All four starting to exhaust
themselves of their strength.]

421
00:24:31,661 --> 00:24:34,305
[Ha Ha is so close to where
Gary hid away his item.]

422
00:24:34,796 --> 00:24:37,505
- Come here, Ji Hyo.
- Suzy...

423
00:24:38,297 --> 00:24:39,951
I need you to move out of the way.

424
00:24:39,952 --> 00:24:41,491
I need you to move out of the way.

425
00:24:41,492 --> 00:24:42,857
[Suzy getting shoved out of the way again.]

426
00:24:44,079 --> 00:24:45,997
[Finally gets a hold of the name tag!]

427
00:24:49,437 --> 00:24:52,262
[Jong Kook is finally ousted!]

428
00:24:57,361 --> 00:24:59,145
Hurry up and find it.

429
00:24:59,737 --> 00:25:01,013
Did he get ousted?

430
00:25:02,733 --> 00:25:05,276
We have to hurry and find
Gary's item.

431
00:25:07,699 --> 00:25:09,836
I can't believe she beat me
with her strength.

432
00:25:10,292 --> 00:25:15,376
[Suzy's pride seems to be wounded after
having been shoved out of the way.]

433
00:25:15,377 --> 00:25:16,985
I'm going to oust every one of them.

434
00:25:18,133 --> 00:25:20,855
- Let's search through all this.
- Where's your report card?

435
00:25:20,856 --> 00:25:22,723
- What about the comic book?
- The comic book?

436
00:25:29,994 --> 00:25:33,254
[Finally finds Gary's item at last!]

437
00:25:35,111 --> 00:25:37,448
[Carefully pulls it out...]

438
00:25:37,449 --> 00:25:38,964
Kang Gary!

439
00:25:39,444 --> 00:25:41,652
[Rushes off to catch Gary!]

440
00:25:41,653 --> 00:25:44,348
- Kang Gary!
- Why? Did you find something?

441
00:25:45,208 --> 00:25:46,414
Did you find something?

442
00:25:46,449 --> 00:25:48,796
[Discovers Gary, the owner of the item!]

443
00:25:52,348 --> 00:25:56,469
[Desperately tries to defend
his name tag.]

444
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,682
[Gary- Out!]

445
00:26:09,613 --> 00:26:12,830
[Fourth period- Group One wins!]

446
00:26:12,831 --> 00:26:14,093
Is it over?

447
00:26:14,094 --> 00:26:16,057
[Class over]

448
00:26:16,058 --> 00:26:17,955
Class is over now.

449
00:26:18,564 --> 00:26:22,145
Since fourth period is over, you all
now get to graduate. Congratulations.

450
00:26:22,146 --> 00:26:24,823
- Thank you.
- I finally get to graduate after 20 years.

451
00:26:25,532 --> 00:26:29,371
Please pick a key of your choice.

452
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:35,005
[Several mysterious keys
laid out on the table...]

453
00:26:35,722 --> 00:26:37,925
Which one are you going to pick?
Is Jae Suk picking the model student one?

454
00:26:37,926 --> 00:26:40,315
- I want this one.
- What does the flower boy one mean?

455
00:26:40,316 --> 00:26:42,899
That one is me.
I'm the only one who fits that.

456
00:26:44,211 --> 00:26:46,473
[Yoo Hyuk chooses the game room key.]

457
00:26:46,474 --> 00:26:49,191
- Should I choose the model student one?
- Then I'll take the last place one.

458
00:26:49,192 --> 00:26:51,753
[Everyone picking a key of their choice.]

459
00:26:51,754 --> 00:26:54,325
Hang on... I'll take this one.

460
00:26:55,073 --> 00:26:58,980
[Gary who's confident with his looks
chooses the key for the flower boy room.]

461
00:26:58,981 --> 00:27:00,866
Flower boy room?
That doesn't really fit you.

462
00:27:02,417 --> 00:27:04,775
Isn't the young lady's room key
not really befitting for Ji Hyo?

463
00:27:06,781 --> 00:27:10,032
- She may be a bit old for that.
- Which one did you pick?

464
00:27:11,589 --> 00:27:14,122
Put your key inside the envelopes
that you see on the table in front of you

465
00:27:14,123 --> 00:27:17,046
and write your name on
the envelope.

466
00:27:17,047 --> 00:27:19,393
This is a letter that
you're writing to yourself.

467
00:27:19,394 --> 00:27:22,296
And then you can put the letters in this
slow mailbox once you're done.

468
00:27:22,297 --> 00:27:26,330
[Envelopes to be placed inside
the slow mailbox.]

469
00:27:27,219 --> 00:27:30,452
- This letter is to your future selves.
- We put them in here?

470
00:27:30,453 --> 00:27:34,050
[The letter is going to get delivered
to my future self?]

471
00:27:34,051 --> 00:27:35,342
Then does this mean that I'm
going to become a flower boy?

472
00:27:35,343 --> 00:27:38,112
That's right.
Gary's will become a flower boy.

473
00:27:38,113 --> 00:27:40,202
[Without knowing what's going to
happen to them down the road...]

474
00:27:40,203 --> 00:27:43,800
[they mail their keys to their
future selves.]

475
00:27:43,801 --> 00:27:46,838
One, two, three.

476
00:27:46,839 --> 00:27:50,600
[Thus they all got to graduate.]

477
00:28:01,046 --> 00:28:06,485
[And the time passes...]

478
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,722
[Five years later.]

479
00:28:10,849 --> 00:28:14,162
['O' University in Kyungido.]

480
00:28:14,163 --> 00:28:15,862
Hey, Gary Kang.

481
00:28:18,246 --> 00:28:22,634
- This... I remember this from five years ago.
- I remember this.

482
00:28:22,635 --> 00:28:25,864
- Remember mailing the key five years ago?
- It's the mailbox from five years ago.

483
00:28:25,865 --> 00:28:27,619
- Remember putting the key in here?
- That's right.

484
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:30,044
I forgot which room key I picked.

485
00:28:30,045 --> 00:28:34,587
This is the first time you're seeing
each other since graduation five years ago.

486
00:28:34,588 --> 00:28:37,233
- Have you been well?
- Hey, how you've been?

487
00:28:37,234 --> 00:28:40,688
- You look the same as ever.
- I heard your baby's grown a lot.

488
00:28:41,345 --> 00:28:43,099
He's already in the army.

489
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:45,705
[Exponential growth in five years?]

490
00:28:46,944 --> 00:28:49,308
You all wrote a letter to
your future selves, didn't you?

491
00:28:49,309 --> 00:28:51,577
- Yes, we did.
- I remember mailing the key.

492
00:28:51,578 --> 00:28:53,488
Make sure to find your own key...

493
00:28:53,489 --> 00:28:57,237
because you all have your own room that
has been prepared especially

494
00:28:57,238 --> 00:29:00,209
for you for the five year reunion.

495
00:29:00,493 --> 00:29:04,075
You'll find a note inside
each of your envelopes.

496
00:29:04,076 --> 00:29:05,520
[A secret note inside the envelopes?]

497
00:29:05,521 --> 00:29:07,902
- This is your future selves?
- Really? Just put them in here?

498
00:29:14,073 --> 00:29:17,901
[Opening up the mailbox.]

499
00:29:17,902 --> 00:29:19,521
This is mine.

500
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:22,540
- Kim Jong Kook.
- I can feel a letter in here.

501
00:29:22,541 --> 00:29:25,575
- I do see a letter in mine too.
- You have to go read it in your room.

502
00:29:25,576 --> 00:29:27,109
We can't show it to each other.

503
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:30,263
<i>Please go to your own chamber of fate.</i>

504
00:29:30,264 --> 00:29:32,575
[Everyone off to their own chamber of fate.]

505
00:29:34,885 --> 00:29:39,629
[What kind of events are awaiting these
friends after five years?]

506
00:29:41,488 --> 00:29:45,519
[Class leader of five years ago, Kwang Soo
finds his Pioneer Room.]

507
00:29:47,254 --> 00:29:51,204
[Items that are befitting of a leader
are found on the table.]

508
00:29:52,988 --> 00:29:55,846
When I think about myself back then...
I don't know what was wrong with me.

509
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,458
Wait, this is...

510
00:29:59,032 --> 00:30:01,644
This is what we hid away
five years ago.

511
00:30:01,645 --> 00:30:06,372
[Different items are found in
each of their own secret rooms.]

512
00:30:06,373 --> 00:30:08,414
Should I see what the letter inside says?

513
00:30:08,415 --> 00:30:12,576
[What information do the letters contain?]

514
00:30:14,064 --> 00:30:18,122
Even though you may not knowing it,
there's a fated couple amongst you

515
00:30:18,123 --> 00:30:20,508
that's been predestined to be together.

516
00:30:22,095 --> 00:30:25,422
Amongst you is a fateful couple
who's been destined to be together.

517

Amongst you is a fateful couple
who's been destined to be together.

518

[Must find their fateful mate
whom they lost five years ago.]

519
00:30:36,875 --> 00:30:38,886
Is there a clue as to who
the couple is?

520

your fate with one of these items in hand</i>

the question.</i>

522

<i>Must get the correct pairing of the items
to know if you're the fated couple or not.</i>

523

Each of these items you see has
a matching mate to it.

524
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,929
You'll be using your items to
find your potential fated mate.

525
00:30:57,930 --> 00:30:59,644
Then do we carry
all these items around with us?

526
00:30:59,645 --> 00:31:03,423
No, you can carry out
only one item at a time with you.

527
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:07,217
[Only one item at a time
may be carried out of the room!]

528
00:31:07,218 --> 00:31:13,776
[The key is to meet up with as many people
as possible with a variety of items in hand.]

529

530

for yourself somewhere inside this building.</i>

[Find out if you're a part of the fated couple
by standing in front of the magical mirror!]

This is going to have me running around
all over the place.

533
00:31:48,614 --> 00:31:50,357
Ha Dong Hoon, where are you?

534
00:31:50,358 --> 00:31:52,269
Suzy! Ji Hyo!

535
00:31:52,270 --> 00:31:56,106
- Suzy!
- Wait right there, because I'm coming down.

536
00:31:57,744 --> 00:31:59,572
- Hey, wait.
- Ji Hyo.

537
00:32:00,170 --> 00:32:02,139
Stay right there, Ha Dong Hoon.

538
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:04,074
- Why are you looking for Ha Dong Hoon?
- What about it?

539
00:32:04,075 --> 00:32:05,762
- What are you doing?
- What?

540
00:32:05,763 --> 00:32:06,954
Which one is your room?

541
00:32:06,955 --> 00:32:10,980
- Me? I'm in the Young Lady's Room.
- Young Lady's Room?

542
00:32:10,981 --> 00:32:14,269
- Hey!
- Young Lady and Flower Boy goes together.

543
00:32:14,270 --> 00:32:15,998
- You're the Flower Boy Room?
- That's right.

544
00:32:17,302 --> 00:32:19,537
Why are you looking for Ha Dong Hoon?

545
00:32:19,538 --> 00:32:21,513
It's because I have something
to discuss with Ha Dong Hoon.

546
00:32:21,514 --> 00:32:23,700
[Could the Monday Couple be the fated couple
just like Gary wishes for them to be?]

547
00:32:23,701 --> 00:32:25,116
- Hello.
- Suzy!

548
00:32:25,117 --> 00:32:27,566
- Have you been well?
- Yeah, I have.

549
00:32:27,774 --> 00:32:31,018
You're a young lady... and doesn't
a young lady and model student...

550
00:32:31,019 --> 00:32:34,003
- Couldn't that be a link?
- You can't look at it like that.

551
00:32:34,004 --> 00:32:36,903
- Couldn't it work that way?
- She'd be more fitting to go with a leader.

552
00:32:36,903 --> 00:32:40,168
Romance usually take place more often
between a young lady and the model student.

553
00:32:40,169 --> 00:32:43,673
- How can you think otherwise?
- But I'm Young Lady Number Two.

554
00:32:43,674 --> 00:32:45,434
- Ah, you're number two?
- Yes, I'm number two.

555
00:32:45,435 --> 00:32:47,950
Suzy is telling you that she doesn't
want to be involved with you.

556
00:32:47,951 --> 00:32:50,538
Is Young Lady Two more
the playful type?

557
00:32:50,539 --> 00:32:52,425
What do you mean,
is she more the playful type?

558
00:32:52,426 --> 00:32:55,838
How can you say something so rude just
because she doesn't want to get involved?

559
00:32:55,839 --> 00:32:59,377
[Who could she be fated to be with?]

560
00:33:01,002 --> 00:33:04,034
- I brought the one thing that I'm sure of.
- What's that?

561
00:33:04,035 --> 00:33:06,363
- Let's find the mirror room first.
- Okay.

562
00:33:06,364 --> 00:33:07,894
It can only be activated when
two people are standing in front of it.

563
00:33:07,895 --> 00:33:10,314
- Yeah, that's what I heard.
- What was it? The magical mirror?

564
00:33:10,315 --> 00:33:13,574
- Yeah, the magical mirror.
- But where are we going to find it?

[Where in this vast space is
the magical mirror hidden away at?]

566

[Could this be the magical mirror?]

575
00:33:51,273 --> 00:33:53,132
- I found it!
- Where is it?

576
00:33:53,133 --> 00:33:54,987
- It's right there.
- How did you find it?

577
00:33:54,988 --> 00:33:57,554
I came in here to check since you said
you were too scared to check it yourself.

578
00:33:57,555 --> 00:33:59,794
I didn't see that even when
I peeked in here?

579
00:33:59,795 --> 00:34:03,708
[The magical mirror... ]

[Mirror, Mirror...
Are we the fated couple?]

585
00:34:36,732 --> 00:34:38,945
- I guess we're not.
- These must not be the right items.

586
00:34:38,946 --> 00:34:43,831
[Is it the items that are not matching,
or the people that are not matching?]

587
00:34:45,970 --> 00:34:48,312
It wouldn't be Running Man if
it was this easy to find.

588
00:34:52,308 --> 00:34:55,018
[On the other hand...]

589

[Cracked mirrors cannot be activated.]

593
00:35:08,265 --> 00:35:10,858
I'll put it back together.
I'll put the mirror back together!

594
00:35:12,204 --> 00:35:13,526
There's a mirror.

595
00:35:13,527 --> 00:35:15,495
But this one is cracked too.

596

[Cracked mirrors found all over
the place.]

597
00:35:17,649 --> 00:35:21,217
I guess not all the mirrors work.

598

You're seriously so pretty.

00:35:37,171 --> 00:35:38,646
You're almost too scary.

602
00:35:38,647 --> 00:35:40,575
It startled me to have such a
pretty face staring over at me.

603
00:35:40,576 --> 00:35:42,224
Why are you so pretty?

604
00:35:42,225 --> 00:35:44,777
- You're unbelievably pretty.
- Are you with Suzy again?

605
00:35:44,778 --> 00:35:46,929
- What are you doing?
- Aren't you going to film this thing?

606
00:35:47,219 --> 00:35:49,635
- We're filming right now.
- We've been filming this whole time.

- No, it's me.
- What?

612
00:36:02,997 --> 00:36:05,592
- Don't go off with Jong Kook.
- Why does everyone think that it's me?

I'm from the Leader's Room.
Look at the spanking stick that you have.

- Come with me.

Okay, then. Let's go.

- Just what am I to you?

We both have to stand in front of it,
and recite this chant.

656
00:37:59,615 --> 00:38:00,803
Okay.

657
00:38:00,804 --> 00:38:02,192
Set, go.

658
00:38:02,193 --> 00:38:05,450
Mirror, Mirror...
Are we the fated couple?

659
00:38:05,451 --> 00:38:11,326
[Mirror, Mirror...
Are we the fated couple?]

660
00:38:12,974 --> 00:38:19,456
[Game Room Manager and the Young Lady...
Could they be the fateful couple?]

661
00:38:19,457 --> 00:38:23,477
[You two are...]

662
00:38:23,478 --> 00:38:25,954
- What is that? What does it mean?
- Are we the couple?

663
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:32,848
[not the fated couple.]

664
00:38:34,342 --> 00:38:38,565
But just because we're not the couple...
why is the message written in blood?

665
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:40,470
It's really creepy.

666
00:38:43,492 --> 00:38:52,040
<i>[If four people or more including yourself
gathers together, someone will die.]</i>

667
00:38:52,041 --> 00:38:59,242
<i>[If four people or more including yourself
gathers together, someone will die.]</i>

668
00:39:01,805 --> 00:39:04,774
- Then that means...
- More than three people can't be together?

669
00:39:04,775 --> 00:39:08,825
Then doesn't it mean if one more person joins
us, then one of us will die?

670
00:39:09,718 --> 00:39:15,830
[Will accept only one question,
and the answer will either be a 'Yes' or 'No']

671
00:39:15,831 --> 00:39:17,823
Then you ask your question first, Suzy.

672
00:39:17,936 --> 00:39:19,961
We can only ask one question.

673
00:39:19,962 --> 00:39:21,700
[Only one question can be asked.]

674
00:39:21,701 --> 00:39:23,061
In that case...

675
00:39:23,062 --> 00:39:26,840
Then does it mean if one more person comes,
then one of us here will die?

676
00:39:27,109 --> 00:39:28,493
- Out?
- What?

677
00:39:28,494 --> 00:39:30,442
- Out?
- What?

678
00:39:31,466 --> 00:39:35,604
[Jae Suk and Suzy are not
the ones it speaks of.]

679
00:39:35,605 --> 00:39:38,757
- Then we don't have to worry about it.
- This is power for you and I.

680
00:39:41,057 --> 00:39:42,921
Then who should we start with?

681
00:39:43,437 --> 00:39:47,885
[If used wisely, someone can get ousted!]

682
00:39:49,951 --> 00:39:57,216
<i>[If three or more people including yourself
gathers around together, someone will die.]</i>

683
00:39:57,217 --> 00:40:02,900
<i>If three or more people including yourself
gathers around together, someone will die.</i>

684
00:40:04,187 --> 00:40:08,379
Then something must have been triggered
by the magical mirror just now.

685
00:40:08,997 --> 00:40:14,526
<i>If three or more people including yourself
gathers around together, someone will die.</i>

686
00:40:14,527 --> 00:40:15,764
Someone will die?

687
00:40:15,765 --> 00:40:19,936
<i>[If three or more people including yourself
gathers around together, someone will die.]</i>

688
00:40:19,937 --> 00:40:21,471
Then we have to scatter ourselves.

689
00:40:22,187 --> 00:40:24,232
This must have something to do
with the mirror.

690
00:40:24,233 --> 00:40:30,211
[Is this the secret of the prophecy?]

691
00:40:31,617 --> 00:40:34,423
If three or more people gets together,
then someone will be ousted?

692
00:40:34,526 --> 00:40:37,665
Wow... that means even though
we don't know who it is

693
00:40:37,666 --> 00:40:40,650
that's going to happen to one of us,
and even though I don't know what mine is...

694
00:40:41,002 --> 00:40:43,679
there's something that's going to
get me ousted too.

695
00:40:46,359 --> 00:40:50,164
- This is something really new.
- Today's concept is really new, isn't it?

696
00:40:50,165 --> 00:40:51,487
[Scary, yet intriguing.]

697
00:40:51,488 --> 00:40:55,175
This means that Suk Jin, you or I
also have a chance of winning this.

698
00:40:55,963 --> 00:40:58,774
- Because it's not a name tag elimination.
- Hey, Kwang Soo!

699
00:40:58,775 --> 00:41:01,426
- Hey, Kwang Soo!
- Run away!

700
00:41:01,844 --> 00:41:07,691
[Escaping since it could be one of them that
dies when three or more gathers together.]

701
00:41:07,692 --> 00:41:08,719
Hey!

702
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:11,434
- Hey, you dummies!
- Don't come any closer!

703
00:41:11,435 --> 00:41:13,345
- Hey, listen to me.
- No!

704
00:41:15,055 --> 00:41:20,362
It's not just me, but someone else can join
you and one of us three can be ousted.

705
00:41:20,363 --> 00:41:21,844
Kwang Soo.

706
00:41:21,845 --> 00:41:23,846
You can stay behind and talk to me.

707
00:41:24,510 --> 00:41:25,946
There would only be the two of us.

708
00:41:26,910 --> 00:41:28,211
Come on!

709
00:41:30,002 --> 00:41:31,481
Come on!

710
00:41:31,482 --> 00:41:34,562
What if you're trying to take me with you
to see someone else?

711
00:41:34,995 --> 00:41:36,231
Come on.

712
00:41:36,232 --> 00:41:38,470
Come on.
Hurry up, we don't have much time.

713
00:41:38,471 --> 00:41:41,867
- Hurry up and come on.
- You acting like this means something is up.

714
00:41:41,868 --> 00:41:43,091
No, I'm not trying to do anything.

715
00:41:43,092 --> 00:41:45,998
The important thing right now is,
we have to go find a mirror.

716
00:41:46,388 --> 00:41:48,029
I'm going to tell you something.

717
00:41:48,030 --> 00:41:50,055
Suzy and I saw something in the mirror.

718
00:41:50,056 --> 00:41:52,151
We saw this mission on the mirror.

719
00:41:52,152 --> 00:41:55,511
If three or more people including yourself
gathers around together, someone will die.

720
00:41:56,705 --> 00:42:00,662
And you can look in the mirror
and ask one question.

721
00:42:00,663 --> 00:42:02,098
What was the question that you asked?

722
00:42:02,099 --> 00:42:03,230
[One question can be asked of the mirror.]

723
00:42:03,606 --> 00:42:05,845
I asked if either
Suzy or myself will be ousted.

724
00:42:05,846 --> 00:42:07,237
And we were told 'no'.

725
00:42:07,651 --> 00:42:12,395
Other than Suzy or myself,
it could be you, Ha Ha or Suk Jin.

726
00:42:12,396 --> 00:42:14,323
If three or more people gets together,
one of you will get ousted.

727
00:42:14,635 --> 00:42:16,998
[Then it means that you're safe?]

728
00:42:16,999 --> 00:42:18,475
Do you still not trust me?

729
00:42:19,271 --> 00:42:23,332
[I wish I could run away.]

730
00:42:26,690 --> 00:42:28,384
<i>Get away from me!</i>

731
00:42:28,385 --> 00:42:30,015
<i>Please stop!</i>

732
00:42:30,016 --> 00:42:32,933
[Kwang Soo's screams are
suddenly heard?]

733
00:42:33,888 --> 00:42:36,340
[Giraffe trying to run away
from Jae Suk!]

734
00:42:36,341 --> 00:42:39,029
Get away from me!
Please stop!

735
00:42:39,625 --> 00:42:45,583
[Giraffe afraid that if three or more people
gathers together, it'll be himself that dies.]

736
00:42:46,270 --> 00:42:47,931
- Kwang Soo.
- I want to live!

737
00:42:47,932 --> 00:42:49,352
Kwang Soo,
I'm not trying to oust you.

738
00:42:49,353 --> 00:42:51,872
- You have to trust me.
- You're lying!

739
00:42:51,873 --> 00:42:54,798
If I let you go right now...

740
00:42:54,799 --> 00:42:58,088
I'm positive that you're going to go
somewhere else and try to come after me.

741
00:42:58,688 --> 00:43:02,368
[No intention of letting the Giraffe go.]

742
00:43:02,369 --> 00:43:03,994
I'll show you that I'm serious.
Just trust me on this.

743
00:43:06,193 --> 00:43:08,850
[Everyone avoiding the situation of
more than three people gathering together.]

744
00:43:14,555 --> 00:43:15,757
Run!

745
00:43:15,758 --> 00:43:17,871
Have you seen Jong Kook?

746
00:43:17,872 --> 00:43:19,561
[I don't want to die!]

747
00:43:19,562 --> 00:43:21,283
Have you seen Jong Kook?

748
00:43:22,008 --> 00:43:26,395
[Suzy feeling at ease knowing that
she's excluded from the curse.]

749
00:43:29,435 --> 00:43:32,112
Why are they running away
from me like that?

750
00:43:33,603 --> 00:43:36,265
Hey, don't come any closer.
Get away from me!

751
00:43:36,266 --> 00:43:38,558
[Telling each other to get away
as soon as they see each other.]

752
00:43:38,963 --> 00:43:41,609
[Giraffe having made his escape
is heading this way.]

753
00:43:41,802 --> 00:43:43,501
Jae Suk is headed this way.

754
00:43:44,313 --> 00:43:47,648
[As soon as they make their way down...
Suzy meets up with them from below.]

755
00:43:51,559 --> 00:43:55,269
[Model student and the Last place person
walking around in search of the mirror.]

756
00:43:57,042 --> 00:43:59,090
- Is something in there?
- Is that one?

757
00:44:00,375 --> 00:44:01,750
There it is.

758
00:44:01,751 --> 00:44:05,077
[Found one!]

759
00:44:05,496 --> 00:44:07,234
Okay, let's say it.

760
00:44:08,087 --> 00:44:16,222
[Report card and a whipping stick-
What will be the mirror's answer?]

761
00:44:17,467 --> 00:44:18,799
- I love you.
- I love you too.

762
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:20,842
- My brother.
- One, two, three.

763
00:44:20,843 --> 00:44:25,316
Mirror, mirror...
Are we the fated couple?

764
00:44:25,317 --> 00:44:27,645
[Mirror, mirror...
Are we the fated couple?]

765
00:44:31,655 --> 00:44:34,951
[You two are...]

766
00:44:34,952 --> 00:44:36,756
We are?

767
00:44:37,818 --> 00:44:39,932
Why does the writing look so scary?

768
00:44:42,566 --> 00:44:45,454
[not the fated couple.]

769
00:44:45,455 --> 00:44:47,365
It's telling us that we're not.

770
00:44:47,775 --> 00:44:49,859
- We're not, but there's something to this.
- We're not the couple.

771
00:44:49,860 --> 00:44:51,823
But the writing was so scary.

772
00:44:51,824 --> 00:44:53,878
Someone...

773
00:44:53,879 --> 00:44:59,132
<i>[Someone... will die if they turn around
and look behind them.]</i>

774
00:44:59,133 --> 00:45:01,213
Someone will die if they turn around
and look behind them.

775
00:45:01,214 --> 00:45:03,494
[Rigid]

776
00:45:03,936 --> 00:45:05,843
Someone will die if they turn around
and look behind them?

777
00:45:05,844 --> 00:45:09,544
<i>[I will accept only one question.]</i>

778
00:45:09,545 --> 00:45:12,598
<i>[But the answer...]</i>

779
00:45:12,599 --> 00:45:17,013
<i>[will be answered either a
'Yes' or a 'No'.]</i>

780
00:45:17,014 --> 00:45:18,854
We have to be careful with
what we ask.

781
00:45:20,474 --> 00:45:24,336
Then let's ask if it's one of us since
the important thing is for us to survive.

782
00:45:24,514 --> 00:45:28,672
Is that one person... one of us?

783
00:45:28,673 --> 00:45:31,199
Is it one of us?
Either Kim Jong Kook or Ha Ha?

784
00:45:35,937 --> 00:45:37,936
- It's a 'No'!
- We're all set!

785
00:45:40,451 --> 00:45:42,416
- We're safe.
- We're not going to die from this.

786
00:45:42,417 --> 00:45:46,029
Okay, Jong Kook.
Let's talk this out right now.

787
00:45:46,030 --> 00:45:47,671
We have to figure this out.

788
00:45:47,672 --> 00:45:50,365
One of us will die if three or more
people gathers together.

789
00:45:50,366 --> 00:45:53,312
And there's another member who'll die if
that person turns around to look behind them.

790
00:45:53,313 --> 00:45:57,444
That's the knowledge we gained by asking
the magical mirror our question.

791
00:45:57,445 --> 00:46:00,910
But even if we look behind us...
we won't die.

792
00:46:00,911 --> 00:46:03,198
- We won't die.
- We have to make others look behind them.

793
00:46:03,199 --> 00:46:04,976
- We have to make others look behind them.
- That's right.

794
00:46:04,977 --> 00:46:08,907
[Very excited about the prospect of
ousting the other members.]

795
00:46:08,908 --> 00:46:12,883
But it could also mean that if someone walks
in here right now, one of us could die.

796
00:46:12,884 --> 00:46:14,749
- We have to stop others from joining us.
- We could be the one to die from that.

797
00:46:15,410 --> 00:46:19,132
[Sound of thunder suddenly being
heard off in the distance.]

798
00:46:20,193 --> 00:46:24,502
<i>Someone will die if they turn around
and look behind them.</i>

799
00:46:25,186 --> 00:46:27,215
Will die if they turn around to
look behind them?

800
00:46:28,618 --> 00:46:35,193
<i>[Someone will die if they turn around
and look behind them.]</i>

801
00:46:35,194 --> 00:46:37,228
What is this all about now?

802
00:46:38,504 --> 00:46:40,386
Why are you seriously doing this?

803
00:46:40,670 --> 00:46:42,292
You're not allowing us to
be able to do anything.

804
00:46:42,293 --> 00:46:44,840
We can't get together or look behind us.
What are we supposed to do here?

805
00:46:44,841 --> 00:46:46,666
[Making them more and more nervous
with each passing moment.]

806
00:46:46,667 --> 00:46:48,610
But it may be referring to me.

807
00:46:48,611 --> 00:46:50,350
It may not be me.

808
00:46:51,555 --> 00:46:54,357
I'm too scared to keep doing
Running Man.

809
00:46:55,014 --> 00:46:56,883
I'm so scared right now.

810
00:46:59,070 --> 00:47:01,396
Give me back my leg.
(A famous line from an old horror legend.)

811
00:47:01,826 --> 00:47:04,509
Running Man is too scary.
Is this a horror special?

812
00:47:07,459 --> 00:47:08,892
We can walk around like this.

813
00:47:09,665 --> 00:47:13,520
[Two middle aged men walking around
supporting each other.]

814
00:47:13,521 --> 00:47:15,556
- Let's walk backwards.
- There's no need for us to do that.

815
00:47:15,557 --> 00:47:18,102
- We can just go this way.
- Is it okay to walk like that?

816
00:47:18,103 --> 00:47:19,703
- We can go this way.
- No, we can't.

817
00:47:19,704 --> 00:47:22,108
[What are they doing?]

818
00:47:22,109 --> 00:47:23,544
We'll be fine as long as
we don't look behind us.

819
00:47:23,545 --> 00:47:26,099
- We just don't have to look behind us?
- We won't die if we go forward.

820
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:27,537
[Unable to comprehend.]

821
00:47:27,538 --> 00:47:30,562
We can go this way and keep going
forward without looking behind us.

822
00:47:30,563 --> 00:47:33,446
- Oh, so we can do it that way?
- What are you thinking?

823
00:47:33,803 --> 00:47:36,572
[Making things even more difficult
with his lack of understanding.]

824
00:47:36,573 --> 00:47:38,975
- You and Suzy are a team, aren't you?
- No, we're not.

825
00:47:38,976 --> 00:47:41,386
- Tell me the truth.
- No, Suk Jin. I'm telling you the truth.

826
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:44,388
- Don't come this way!
- Don't come this way!

827
00:47:44,389 --> 00:47:46,999
[More than three is dangerous!
Everyone cautious of each other.]

828
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:50,752
- Running into Suzy like this is scary.
- Suzy, are you behind me?

829
00:47:50,753 --> 00:47:52,387
Yes, I'm right behind you.
Don't turn around.

830
00:47:52,388 --> 00:47:53,754
No, I'm not looking.

831
00:47:53,755 --> 00:47:56,238
- There's nowhere for us to turn.
- Seriously.

832
00:47:56,239 --> 00:47:59,426
- Do we have to make a P-turn?
- It's called a U-turn.

833
00:47:59,427 --> 00:48:00,820
Let's make a U-turn over here.

834
00:48:00,821 --> 00:48:03,807
[A necessary U-turn to go back
in the direction where they came from.]

835
00:48:03,808 --> 00:48:07,610
[Behaving just like a car would.]

836
00:48:07,611 --> 00:48:09,586
Why did they come up with
a rule like this?

837
00:48:11,589 --> 00:48:13,717
<i>Which one are you, Ji Hyo?</i>

838
00:48:13,718 --> 00:48:15,262
- What do you have, Suzy?
- Me?

839
00:48:15,263 --> 00:48:16,698
I have a hairpin.

840
00:48:16,699 --> 00:48:18,277
- I have a headband on.
- Seriously?

841
00:48:18,278 --> 00:48:20,712
- This one up here.
- I have mine on too.

842
00:48:20,713 --> 00:48:22,710
- Maybe we're the couple.
- Do you know where a mirror is?

843
00:48:22,711 --> 00:48:25,230
- The mirror...
- Where could a mirror be?

844
00:48:26,492 --> 00:48:29,276
- Let's look around here.
- Hurry up and get out of here!

845
00:48:29,277 --> 00:48:30,586
Don't come this way!

846
00:48:30,587 --> 00:48:33,512
We'll be fine as long as he stays away.
He's just so loud.

847
00:48:34,965 --> 00:48:36,914
Hey, don't look!
Don't look behind you!

848
00:48:36,915 --> 00:48:39,154
I'm walking behind you
so don't come any closer either.

849
00:48:39,772 --> 00:48:42,122
- Go up to the fifth floor, Gary!
- Don't come this way!

850
00:48:42,123 --> 00:48:44,490
- Don't come this way!
- Don't come! No one come this way.

851
00:48:44,782 --> 00:48:47,600
[Everyone in a state of chaos to ensure
that no more than three are gathered around.]

852
00:48:48,111 --> 00:48:51,443
Just hurry up and go somewhere.
I want you to get away.

853
00:48:57,469 --> 00:48:59,946
[What is that?]

854
00:49:02,887 --> 00:49:09,433
[DIY neck brace.]

855
00:49:09,434 --> 00:49:10,838
Let's go.
Please let it be us.

856
00:49:10,839 --> 00:49:15,893
[The Easy Brothers-
Could they be the fateful couple?]

857
00:49:17,133 --> 00:49:18,729
There it is!
This way, Suk Jin.

858
00:49:19,956 --> 00:49:22,975
This is where I saw Jae Suk earlier.
It's still here!

859
00:49:22,976 --> 00:49:26,141
[Working in sync together to
find the magical mirror.]

860
00:49:26,142 --> 00:49:30,727
- I have 'Basic Instinct' movie.
- And I have 'Sunday Seoul'.

861
00:49:30,762 --> 00:49:32,357
If this isn't a pair,
then what else could it be?

862
00:49:32,358 --> 00:49:35,699
One, two, three. Mirror, mirror...
Are we the fated couple?

863
00:49:35,700 --> 00:49:38,477
[Mirror, mirror...
Are we the fated couple?]

864
00:49:39,957 --> 00:49:41,343
[The two of you are...]

865
00:49:43,369 --> 00:49:45,540
- The two of you are...
- The two of you are...

866
00:49:50,155 --> 00:49:52,523
[not the fated couple.]

867
00:49:52,857 --> 00:49:55,959
[Disappointed...]

868
00:49:56,442 --> 00:49:58,062
How can we not be?

869
00:49:58,609 --> 00:50:00,643
Someone...

870
00:50:02,395 --> 00:50:07,193
<i>[Someone will die if they
scream out loud.]</i>

871
00:50:07,194 --> 00:50:12,147
<i>[Someone will die if they
scream out loud.]</i>

872
00:50:12,148 --> 00:50:13,511
Someone will die if they
scream out loud?

873
00:50:13,512 --> 00:50:17,357
[Someone will die if they
scream out loud?]

874
00:50:19,005 --> 00:50:21,908
<i>[You may ask one question.]</i>

875
00:50:21,909 --> 00:50:23,624
- What do you want to ask?
- What should we ask?

876
00:50:24,149 --> 00:50:28,282
Is that someone,
one of us standing here?

877
00:50:28,283 --> 00:50:31,075
[Could the person who dies from screaming
be one of them standing there?]

878
00:50:39,077 --> 00:50:43,854
<i>Someone will die if they
scream out loud.</i>

879
00:50:43,855 --> 00:50:46,059
[Someone will die if they scream out loud.]

880
00:50:46,060 --> 00:50:49,942
<i>Someone will die if they
scream out loud.</i>

881
00:50:49,943 --> 00:50:52,030
Someone will die if they
scream out loud?

882
00:50:53,568 --> 00:50:55,615
Someone will die if they
scream out loud?

883
00:50:55,616 --> 00:50:58,459
Then who was it that just screamed?
Wasn't that Kwang Soo's voice?

884
00:51:02,036 --> 00:51:05,210
Doesn't this make you feel like something
scary is waiting for us today?

885
00:51:05,211 --> 00:51:07,388
[The mood is turning scarier
with each passing moment.]

886
00:51:07,389 --> 00:51:09,091
Someone will die if they turn around
to look behind them.

887
00:51:09,092 --> 00:51:11,440
We have to walk around either alone,
or in pairs...

888
00:51:11,441 --> 00:51:13,212
and now we can't scream out
loud either.

889
00:51:13,213 --> 00:51:16,658
[They thought this was going to be a romance
with the game being called,' Fateful Couple'.]

890
00:51:16,658 --> 00:51:18,174
[But this is just sheer terror.]

891
00:51:18,175 --> 00:51:22,046
- Don't you think that this is really scary?
- Can you just eliminate me right now?

892
00:51:22,416 --> 00:51:24,547
I think that jail will be the least
scariest place.

893
00:51:25,375 --> 00:51:26,841
This is no joke right now.

894
00:51:26,842 --> 00:51:30,221
What's even scarier is that I have yet to hear
the announcement of Suk Jin getting ousted.

895
00:51:31,706 --> 00:51:33,794
I feel like something isn't quite right.

896
00:51:33,795 --> 00:51:35,843
Jae Suk, let's try to figure this out.

897
00:51:35,844 --> 00:51:39,714
[Getting back up to
look for the magical mirror.]

898
00:51:40,412 --> 00:51:41,583
- Jae Suk.
- Yeah?

899
00:51:42,812 --> 00:51:45,372
You keep trying to get me
to turn around.

900
00:51:45,936 --> 00:51:47,302
You never know.

901
00:51:47,303 --> 00:51:50,854
[Something is definitely up today...]

902
00:51:52,098 --> 00:51:56,118
[Easy Brothers staying resilient
in their search for the mirror.]

903
00:51:56,119 --> 00:51:58,779
Look at that.
I think Jae Suk tried this one.

904
00:51:58,780 --> 00:52:00,495
It's still good.

905
00:52:00,828 --> 00:52:03,385
If these two aren't a match,
then I don't know what is. One, two, three.

906
00:52:03,386 --> 00:52:05,770
Mirror, mirror...
Are we the fated couple?

907
00:52:09,741 --> 00:52:11,273
<i>[No, you're not.]</i>

908
00:52:11,274 --> 00:52:12,714
No, you're not.

909
00:52:12,715 --> 00:52:14,048
It's wrong again.

910
00:52:14,049 --> 00:52:16,176
- Suk Jin, something else is coming up.
- There's another message?

911
00:52:16,177 --> 00:52:22,519
<i>[Someone will die if they
become uglier.]</i>

912
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:25,166
- Someone will die if they become uglier?
- Poor Gary!

913
00:52:25,167 --> 00:52:28,546
[You have no room to worry about others.]

914
00:52:28,547 --> 00:52:30,782
- What are you going to do, Kwang Soo?
- What does this mean?

915
00:52:30,783 --> 00:52:32,806
What kind of a prophecy is that?
Someone will die if they become uglier?

916
00:52:32,807 --> 00:52:36,105
- You may ask one question.
- I really don't want this to be me.

917
00:52:36,106 --> 00:52:39,346
- Anything else, but not this one.
- If it says yes, then it's you.

918
00:52:39,347 --> 00:52:41,104
What are you talking about?

919
00:52:41,105 --> 00:52:44,639
Is it... one of us two?

920
00:52:47,531 --> 00:52:49,356
- It's a 'No'!
- Yes.

921
00:52:50,974 --> 00:52:55,557
[Another roaring sound of thunder.]

922
00:52:55,558 --> 00:52:58,097
<i>Someone will die if they become uglier.</i>

923
00:52:59,637 --> 00:53:02,710
- Someone will die if they become uglier.
- Say what?

924
00:53:06,299 --> 00:53:08,483
You're the only one that it applies to.

925
00:53:09,446 --> 00:53:12,127
You always look so much uglier
when you take your glasses off.

926
00:53:13,421 --> 00:53:15,904
You have to admit that it's true.

927
00:53:16,654 --> 00:53:18,030
Could it be me?

928
00:53:18,646 --> 00:53:20,770
Why don't you try taking off
your glasses?

929
00:53:21,831 --> 00:53:24,642
Come on, just try it.
I doubt it'll make you that much uglier.

930
00:53:24,643 --> 00:53:26,392
Just try it and take them off.

931
00:53:26,393 --> 00:53:28,198
[Trying to ease away...]

932
00:53:28,199 --> 00:53:30,233
[But there's no way that Jong Kook
will let him go.]

933
00:53:30,234 --> 00:53:32,789
- There's no way.
- Just try it.

934
00:53:32,790 --> 00:53:34,663
- No, then look behind you.
- I doubt that it means you.

935
00:53:35,895 --> 00:53:37,771
- Then look behind you.
- It doesn't matter to me.

936
00:53:37,772 --> 00:53:39,459
- What did you say?
- Turn around and look behind you.

937
00:53:39,876 --> 00:53:42,499
- Try taking off your glasses.
- Turn around and then I'll take them off.

938
00:53:44,059 --> 00:53:45,420
Turn around and look behind you.

939
00:53:46,689 --> 00:53:48,211
Is it me?

940
00:53:48,212 --> 00:53:50,295
I think I'm going to die.

941
00:53:50,708 --> 00:53:56,246
No, I don't think that's what it means.
I think you have to make an ugly face.

942
00:53:56,247 --> 00:53:57,629
Don't you think it means something
like that?

943
00:53:58,013 --> 00:54:01,465
[I'm supposed to be the
flower boy today...]

944
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,295
- Ji Hyo.
- Hey.

945
00:54:03,296 --> 00:54:06,225
[Practicing not turning around.]

946
00:54:07,285 --> 00:54:08,449
Ji Hyo.

947
00:54:08,450 --> 00:54:09,952
- Where are you?
- Where are you?

948
00:54:10,685 --> 00:54:12,742
Suzy.
No, don't come any closer.

949
00:54:12,743 --> 00:54:14,130
Hey, don't come any closer.

950
00:54:14,131 --> 00:54:15,201
Don't come!

951
00:54:15,202 --> 00:54:17,975
[Oh no! The three of them
are gathered together!]

952
00:54:17,976 --> 00:54:19,845
- Let's go.
- Suk Jin, let's go.

953
00:54:19,846 --> 00:54:22,129
- Suzy...
- Suzy, why are you being so bold?

954
00:54:22,130 --> 00:54:24,033
You won't die even if three people
gather together, will you?

955
00:54:24,412 --> 00:54:26,886
- What?
- You and Jae Suk asked the question, right?

956
00:54:26,887 --> 00:54:29,968
[Jae Suk and Suzy won't die even if
three or more people gather together.]

957
00:54:29,969 --> 00:54:32,426
- Wait a second.
- I don't think it's either one of you.

958
00:54:32,427 --> 00:54:37,775
[But all of them are still safe even though
there are three of them together?]

959
00:54:37,776 --> 00:54:40,463
[We already knew that about Suzy.]

960
00:54:40,464 --> 00:54:45,105
[Nothing's happening to either Suk Jin or
Kwang Soo even though they're all together.]

961
00:54:45,106 --> 00:54:47,125
- Doesn't this mean that it's not us?
- What's going on here?

962
00:54:47,126 --> 00:54:49,788
- Even when we're together like this?
- I don't think it's either one of you.

963
00:54:49,789 --> 00:54:52,053
- Have you looked behind you yet?
- No.

964
00:54:52,054 --> 00:54:53,739
- Let's go in the room.
- I may die if I looked behind me.

965
00:54:53,740 --> 00:54:55,333
[The three of them going in the room to
test out their theory.]

966
00:54:57,368 --> 00:55:00,369
- You look so natural walking around.
- Shut the door.

967
00:55:00,370 --> 00:55:03,022
- This is really crazy.
- No, it's not one of you.

968
00:55:03,023 --> 00:55:05,207
- Can one of you look behind you?
- One, two, three.

969
00:55:06,889 --> 00:55:08,687
- It must not be us.
- If it's not you two...

970
00:55:08,688 --> 00:55:10,959
[Still safe even though they're all
standing in the same room together.]

971
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:14,441
[Someone will die if three or more are
together, but the Easy Brothers are safe!]

972
00:55:14,442 --> 00:55:15,716
Hang on.

973
00:55:15,717 --> 00:55:17,933
Wait... it's not Jae Suk
or you two...

974
00:55:17,933 --> 00:55:20,840
Then it's either Ha Ha, Gary, Jong Kook
or Ji Hyo.

975
00:55:20,841 --> 00:55:25,448
[The person who'll die in the presence of
three or more are the other four.]

976
00:55:25,449 --> 00:55:27,659
You really want to oust Jong Kook
right now, don't you?

977
00:55:28,109 --> 00:55:29,827
I think it's him.

978
00:55:29,828 --> 00:55:32,545
He's going around avoiding
everyone else right now.

979
00:55:33,619 --> 00:55:35,886
I'm the only one that
he's not avoiding right now.

980
00:55:35,887 --> 00:55:37,797
I think I'm the only one
who'll be able to do it.

981
00:55:37,798 --> 00:55:40,221
<i>[Jong Kook, want to take your pencil and come
to the mirror room with me? - Suzy.]</i>

982
00:55:40,521 --> 00:55:43,844
[Jong Kook discovers Suzy's
note for him.]

983
00:55:50,071 --> 00:55:51,585
Are you by yourself?

984
00:55:51,586 --> 00:55:55,794
[Suzy and Jong Kook meeting up
with a diary and a pencil in hand.]

985
00:55:55,795 --> 00:55:59,564
[Suzy succeeds in luring Jong Kook in.]

986
00:56:00,249 --> 00:56:04,358
[Suzy luring him into the mirror room.]

987
00:56:06,067 --> 00:56:08,538
[Shutting the door tight for now.]

988
00:56:09,161 --> 00:56:12,943
[Getting ready to recite the chant
in front of the mirror.]

989
00:56:12,944 --> 00:56:15,049
[Now is the time!]

990
00:56:15,050 --> 00:56:18,110
[Giraffe enters the room!]

991
00:56:18,179 --> 00:56:19,896
What are you doing?

992
00:56:19,897 --> 00:56:21,237
What are you doing?

993
00:56:21,238 --> 00:56:24,073
[Tiger senses sudden danger!]

994
00:56:24,777 --> 00:56:26,447
What are you doing?
What's going on here?

995
00:56:27,287 --> 00:56:29,195
What's going on here?
Suzy, did you lure me in here?

996
00:56:29,196 --> 00:56:30,753
No, not at all.

997
00:56:30,754 --> 00:56:32,829
Did you lure me in here?

998
00:56:33,409 --> 00:56:36,943
[Time to counterattack!
Jong Kook making Kwang Soo's face uglier.]

999
00:56:41,545 --> 00:56:44,485
I don't think it's you.
It must be Ha Ha.

1000
00:56:44,486 --> 00:56:49,080
[Jong Kook, Suzy, and Kwang Soo-
Thought that Jong Kook would get ousted.]

1001
00:56:49,852 --> 00:56:51,713
Then why don't you come in here?

1002
00:56:51,714 --> 00:56:54,945
[Suk Jin also enters to make it a group
of four just to make sure.]

1003
00:56:55,466 --> 00:56:58,190
[Just then]

1004
00:57:07,655 --> 00:57:09,041
What's that?

1005
00:57:09,042 --> 00:57:10,257
What is that?

1006
00:57:11,433 --> 00:57:13,097
- Something's happening, isn't it?
- Yes.

1007
00:57:18,249 --> 00:57:23,337
<i>[If three or more including yourself is
gathered together, then someone will die.]</i>

1008
00:57:23,338 --> 00:57:29,155
<i>[If three or more including yourself is
gathered together, then someone will die.]</i>

1009
00:57:29,823 --> 00:57:31,163
What's that?

1010
00:57:31,732 --> 00:57:34,039
<i>I told you not to gather around
three people or more.</i>

1011
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:38,423
<i>[I told you not to gather around
three people or more.]</i>

1012
00:57:40,767 --> 00:57:46,881
[The grim reapers are
taking him away?]

1013
00:57:46,882 --> 00:57:52,152
[The one cursed with that prophecy,
Kim Jong Kook is out!]

1014
00:57:52,153 --> 00:57:55,775
<i>I told you not to gather around
three people or more.</i>

1015
00:57:55,810 --> 00:58:01,197
<i>[I told you not to gather around
three people or more.]</i>

1016
00:58:01,198 --> 00:58:02,749
Someone must've gotten in a
group of three or more.

1017
00:58:02,750 --> 00:58:05,514
- It means someone was in a group, right?
- Someone's just been ousted.

1018
00:58:05,515 --> 00:58:07,502
<i>[I told you not to gather around
three people or more.]</i>

1019
00:58:07,503 --> 00:58:10,248
This is scary.
Why does it have to be said like that?

1020
00:58:16,501 --> 00:58:18,008
Suzy is the best.

1021
00:58:18,009 --> 00:58:20,908
[What?]

1022
00:58:22,924 --> 00:58:25,207
You're the first one to get ousted?

1023
00:58:26,604 --> 00:58:28,329
You're not it, are you?

1024
00:58:30,552 --> 00:58:31,978
Is the mirror still good?

1025
00:58:31,979 --> 00:58:33,218
- What?
- Is the mirror still good?

1026
00:58:33,219 --> 00:58:35,872
- I don't know.
- Check and see if it's still good.

1027
00:58:36,288 --> 00:58:38,958
[What?]

1028
00:58:38,959 --> 00:58:41,199
[What's going on with these two?]

1029
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:45,712
[There's something going on
with these two!]

1030
00:58:50,724 --> 00:58:53,876
[A little while ago.]

1031
00:58:54,265 --> 00:58:57,680
- Have you found a mate yet?
- Let's try the mirror room together.

1032
00:58:57,681 --> 00:58:59,588
- The mirror? Us two?
- Yeah, the mirror room.

1033
00:58:59,589 --> 00:59:03,399
- Yeah, us too. I have a hairpin.
- What? I have a headband.

1034
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:06,890
[Ji Hyo and Suzy in possession of
a hairpin and a headband.]

1035
00:59:06,891 --> 00:59:08,363
Do you know where the mirror is?

1036
00:59:09,246 --> 00:59:13,363
[And that's how the two young girls
found themselves in front of the mirror.]

1037
00:59:13,364 --> 00:59:16,908
Mirror, mirror...
Are we the fated couple?

1038
00:59:19,526 --> 00:59:21,838
[You two are...]

1039
00:59:21,839 --> 00:59:24,300
[the fated couple.]

1040
00:59:24,301 --> 00:59:28,348
[These two are the fated couple?]

1041
00:59:28,349 --> 00:59:31,382
[It was us all along...
We're the fated couple!]

1042
00:59:31,383 --> 00:59:36,094
<i>[Go to one of your supply rooms
immediately.]</i>

1043
00:59:37,948 --> 00:59:41,113
Go to one of your supply rooms
immediately.

1044
00:59:41,114 --> 00:59:42,733
The two of us together?

1045
00:59:43,359 --> 00:59:44,830
Let's go.
Let's hurry up and go.

1046
00:59:45,427 --> 00:59:47,609
Suzy!
It's been us all along!

1047
00:59:52,605 --> 00:59:56,093
[A mysterious shipping bag in
one of the girl's room?]

1048
00:59:56,670 --> 00:59:58,809
Running Man High School
attendance record?

1049
00:59:59,684 --> 01:00:01,673
Graduation pictures?

1050
01:00:01,674 --> 01:00:03,529
[And even a Running Man High School
yearbook picture?]

1051
01:00:04,558 --> 01:00:05,773
Is that a cassette player?

1052
01:00:06,169 --> 01:00:09,401
[Even an old cassette tape that
they used to use back in the day.]

1053
01:00:12,663 --> 01:00:14,885
Huh?
We're not in this picture.

1054
01:00:14,886 --> 01:00:16,668
We're missing from this picture.

1055
01:00:16,669 --> 01:00:19,401
[Why are there only male students
in the group picture?]

1056
01:00:20,744 --> 01:00:22,581
We're not in this picture!

1057
01:00:33,076 --> 01:00:41,917
[It was a group picture that
they all took together five years ago...]

1058
01:00:41,918 --> 01:00:43,272
<i>- Congratulations, guys!
- Congratulations!</i>

1059
01:00:50,921 --> 01:00:54,133
[Just who are these two girls?]

1060
01:00:55,289 --> 01:00:59,785
<i>Even though you two were sisters
with a very close relationship...</i>

1061
01:01:00,247 --> 01:01:03,256
<i>unfortunately you became ghosts.</i>

1062
01:01:03,257 --> 01:01:05,233
<i>[Unfortunately became ghosts.]</i>

1063
01:01:05,234 --> 01:01:11,116
[Ghosts?]

1064
01:01:12,850 --> 01:01:15,416
[Five years ago.]

1065
01:01:17,163 --> 01:01:18,444
Quiet.

1066
01:01:18,445 --> 01:01:21,258
Why are you boys so
full of chatter this morning?

1067
01:01:21,259 --> 01:01:23,327
Why are you boys so full of chatter?

1068
01:01:25,397 --> 01:01:28,468
Teacher Go, can we not run out on the field
if we don't have running shoes on?

1069
01:01:28,469 --> 01:01:30,239
Okay, as for the field...

1070
01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:34,472
[Even though Ji Hyo asked a question...
the teacher was unable to hear her.]

1071
01:01:35,608 --> 01:01:38,867
In the way that you're seated already,
group one is one team.

1072
01:01:38,868 --> 01:01:47,236
[And it's because the two girls never even
existed at the Running High School.]

1073
01:01:53,703 --> 01:01:59,366
<i>Once the Running High School friends
find out that you two are ghosts...</i>

1074
01:01:59,367 --> 01:02:02,294
<i>they're going to try to
eliminate you.</i>

1075
01:02:03,079 --> 01:02:11,330
<i>You two ghost sisters... must get rid of
all the Running High's male students.</i>

1076
01:02:11,331 --> 01:02:15,036
<i>[Get rid of them...]</i>

1077
01:02:23,633 --> 01:02:27,310
[Notes are written in the attendance record
to show who's been cursed with what.]

1078
01:02:28,290 --> 01:02:30,309
<i>[Loves to hang around with his friends.]</i>

1079
01:02:30,310 --> 01:02:31,569
That's him perfectly.

1080
01:02:33,019 --> 01:02:35,007
<i>[Even though three people were
initially gathered together...]</i>

1081
01:02:35,008 --> 01:02:37,012
<i>[Suzy being a ghost didn't count
in that mix.]</i>

1082
01:02:37,013 --> 01:02:39,929
<i>[And once Jong Kook felt reassured...]</i>

1083
01:02:39,930 --> 01:02:43,163
<i>[Suk Jin was finally brought
into the room.]</i>

1084
01:02:45,013 --> 01:02:51,128
[With the gathering of Jong Kook, Suk Jin,
and Kwang Soo- Jong Kook is ousted!]

1085
01:02:51,152 --> 01:02:56,737
[Unbelievable plan of utilizing the fact that
she wouldn't count since she's only a ghost!]

1086
01:02:57,641 --> 01:02:59,530
Oh my goodness... what do we do?

1087
01:03:01,455 --> 01:03:04,771
<i>[Ha Ha is usually quiet and
normally doesn't have much to say.]</i>

1088
01:03:04,772 --> 01:03:08,630
<i>[Kwang Soo never pays attention to class,
and is always looking behind him.]</i>

1089
01:03:11,576 --> 01:03:12,924
That's totally him.

1090
01:03:12,925 --> 01:03:15,130
He'll die if he's made to look ugly.

1091
01:03:15,131 --> 01:03:18,026
Jae Suk only worries about his looks.

1092
01:03:18,027 --> 01:03:19,446
<i>[Has more interested in his looks
rather than in his studies.]</i>

1093
01:03:19,746 --> 01:03:23,738
Let's come take a look at this again
whenever someone gets ousted.

1094
01:03:23,739 --> 01:03:25,734
[Agreeing to come and recheck the list
whenever the mirror's curse is carried out.]

1095
01:03:25,735 --> 01:03:30,536
[The ghost sister's clever planning.]

1096
01:03:33,153 --> 01:03:35,605
[I'm sorry, guys...]

1097
01:03:35,606 --> 01:03:44,178
[But we're going to have to
eliminate you.]

1098
01:03:56,262 --> 01:03:58,915
[The ghost playing ghost?]

1099
01:04:02,047 --> 01:04:03,651
[Whips around again.]

1100
01:04:07,983 --> 01:04:11,276
[The older sibling ghost is trying to
sneak up on the Giraffe.]

1101
01:04:11,277 --> 01:04:15,650
[What was Kwang Soo's curse again?]

1102
01:04:17,687 --> 01:04:21,502
<i>Instead of concentrating in class,
he's always turning around to look behind him.</i>

1103
01:04:22,938 --> 01:04:24,219
<i>That's totally him.</i>

1104
01:04:25,726 --> 01:04:29,970
[So you'll die if you look behind you.]

1105
01:04:29,971 --> 01:04:31,276
- It's cracked?
- Yeah.

1106
01:04:34,950 --> 01:04:36,476
What are you doing?

1107
01:04:37,930 --> 01:04:39,318
Why are you doing that?

1108
01:04:39,647 --> 01:04:41,816
[Still not turning around to look behind him!]

1109
01:04:43,045 --> 01:04:44,800
Why are you doing this, Ji Hyo?
What are you doing?

1110
01:04:45,722 --> 01:04:47,106
Here it is.

1111
01:04:47,107 --> 01:04:49,948
[Suzy brings Ha Ha over to the mirror to
find out what the other curse is?]

1112
01:04:49,949 --> 01:04:53,215
Mirror, mirror...
Are we the fated couple?

1113
01:04:55,362 --> 01:04:58,523
[No, you're not.]

1114
01:04:58,524 --> 01:05:00,996
[I bet it's time for another curse
to be revealed!]

1115
01:05:01,768 --> 01:05:08,358
<i>[Someone will die if they get wet.]</i>

1116
01:05:08,714 --> 01:05:12,226
[Yes!
That's another curse revealed!]

1117
01:05:13,087 --> 01:05:17,420
<i>Someone will die if they get wet</i>

1118
01:05:17,421 --> 01:05:19,731
<i>[Someone will die if they get wet.]</i>

1119
01:05:22,918 --> 01:05:26,417
<i>[Can be very sentimental
and loves rainy days.]</i>

1120
01:05:27,745 --> 01:05:28,807
Are you by any chance...

1121
01:05:29,126 --> 01:05:30,752
Sorry to ask, but are you
trying to get me to turn around?

1122
01:05:30,753 --> 01:05:32,151
No, I'm not.

1123
01:05:32,152 --> 01:05:35,064
If I was trying to do that,
I would've made you do it already.

1124
01:05:37,766 --> 01:05:39,693
Where's the mirror...

1125
01:05:39,694 --> 01:05:42,297
[Older sister ghost coming up
behind him again.]

1126
01:05:48,001 --> 01:05:50,353
[Water?]

1127
01:05:52,977 --> 01:05:55,401
Let's just die together!
Let's just all die together!

1128
01:05:55,972 --> 01:05:58,792
[Giraffe's stress level explodes!]

1129
01:05:58,793 --> 01:06:00,081
Who needs the mirror?
Let's all just die together!

1130
01:06:00,082 --> 01:06:01,354
What's going on?

1131
01:06:01,355 --> 01:06:03,935
[Giraffe's screams heard
throughout the building.]

1132
01:06:03,936 --> 01:06:05,623
- That's Kwang Soo.
- Why is he screaming?

1133
01:06:06,548 --> 01:06:10,849
[This is it... this is my chance!]

1134
01:06:11,378 --> 01:06:13,726
He'll die if he becomes ugly.

1135
01:06:13,727 --> 01:06:16,371
Jae Suk only cares about his looks.

1136
01:06:19,821 --> 01:06:23,437
[I will make you look even uglier.]

1137
01:06:26,669 --> 01:06:29,744
[His glasses!]

1138
01:06:31,278 --> 01:06:33,799
[Jae Suk barely manages to
escape danger!]

1139
01:06:33,800 --> 01:06:36,066
- Suzy... you seriously are no joke.
- Seriously, Suzy.

1140
01:06:36,067 --> 01:06:38,982
[Little sister ghost unfortunately
fails her mission.]

1141
01:06:38,983 --> 01:06:40,802
- You're trying to make him uglier?
- Yeah, she is.

1142
01:06:42,786 --> 01:06:44,205
Are either of us ousted?

1143
01:06:45,007 --> 01:06:47,550
With us both soaking wet,
I don't think water is what'll oust us.

1144
01:06:47,551 --> 01:06:48,750
Let's go.

1145
01:06:48,751 --> 01:06:50,368
We're back to being partners.

1146
01:06:50,938 --> 01:06:52,104
Give me your hand.

1147
01:06:52,105 --> 01:06:54,694
[But no one...]

1148
01:06:54,695 --> 01:06:58,122
[Suspected the two girls of being ghosts.]

1149
01:06:58,419 --> 01:07:01,173
- Are you going to attack me?
- No, I'm not!

1150
01:07:01,846 --> 01:07:04,063
[I have to be cautious
about how I attack him.]

1151
01:07:04,610 --> 01:07:06,102
No, I'm not.

1152
01:07:08,902 --> 01:07:11,553
[Ha Ha and Suzy having returned
to the mirror room.]

1153
01:07:11,554 --> 01:07:14,661
<i>Mirror, mirror...
Are we the fated couple?</i>

1154
01:07:14,662 --> 01:07:18,584
[Older sister ghost is also back to the mirror
to find out what the last curse is.]

1155
01:07:18,585 --> 01:07:21,436
- I don't think we are. It's red lettering.
- But that's what it usually looks like.

1156
01:07:21,437 --> 01:07:24,154
- That's what it normally looks like.
- See? We're not it.

1157
01:07:24,155 --> 01:07:26,461
[Okay. Hurry up and
tell me what the curse is.]

1158
01:07:26,462 --> 01:07:31,395
<i>[But... go search through the lockers.]</i>

1159
01:07:31,396 --> 01:07:33,055
- Search through the lockers?
- Search through the lockers?

1160
01:07:34,659 --> 01:07:39,395
[It's not a curse?
What's this?]

1161
01:07:39,396 --> 01:07:40,849
I know where the lockers are.

1162
01:07:40,850 --> 01:07:44,197
- I know where the lockers are.
- You've seen the lockers?

1163
01:07:44,198 --> 01:07:46,161
- Let's go and check.
- Okay, let's go.

1164
01:07:46,563 --> 01:07:52,147
[Older sister ghost getting nervous
at the unexpected message.]

1165
01:07:52,148 --> 01:07:53,314
Gary.

1166
01:07:53,315 --> 01:07:55,933
- Let's keep what we just found a secret.
- Okay, I got it.

1167
01:07:56,977 --> 01:07:59,889
There must be at least
2,000 lockers in here.

1168
01:07:59,890 --> 01:08:04,868
[Somewhere amongst these countless
numbers of lockers...]

1169
01:08:04,869 --> 01:08:10,331
[Something wrapped in secrecy
is waiting to be found.]

1170
01:08:13,330 --> 01:08:18,735
[Ji Hyo searching through all the lockers
with a sense of nervous energy.]

1171
01:08:21,645 --> 01:08:28,659
[I'm getting a bad feeling about this.
Something's in one of these lockers.]

1172
01:08:32,616 --> 01:08:35,090
Suzy, it would be absolutely hilarious
if this turns out to be the one.

1173
01:08:35,091 --> 01:08:36,817
[Haroro returning with a cushion in hand.]

1174
01:08:36,818 --> 01:08:41,327
[Unable to shake his desire of
wanting to be a part of the fated couple.]

1175
01:08:41,328 --> 01:08:43,591
See how I'm leaning up on the cushion?

1176
01:08:46,211 --> 01:08:48,177
- Let's try them all.
- Let's try this one first.

1177
01:08:48,178 --> 01:08:50,190
If nothing else,
we may earn another hint.

1178
01:08:50,191 --> 01:08:52,572
One, two, three.

1179
01:08:52,573 --> 01:08:56,108
Mirror, mirror...
Are we the fated couple?

1180
01:09:02,403 --> 01:09:06,028
[Truly seems to be upset.]

1181
01:09:07,808 --> 01:09:11,151
- I'll see you later.
- Want to bring something else, Suzy?

1182
01:09:12,153 --> 01:09:13,569
- Me?
- Yeah.

1183
01:09:14,667 --> 01:09:19,007
[Wait...]

1184
01:09:19,008 --> 01:09:20,873
- Okay.
- Okay.

1185
01:09:25,249 --> 01:09:30,064
There's got to be something since the mirror
keeps giving us the chance to ask.

1186
01:09:42,445 --> 01:09:45,748
[Little sister Suzy slowly sneaks up on Ha Ha
who'll die if he screams out loud!]

1187
01:09:50,707 --> 01:09:53,240
This is my giraffe.

1188
01:09:53,241 --> 01:09:56,628
[Muttering to himself out of nervousness.]

1189
01:09:56,629 --> 01:09:58,216
It's like Kwang Soo.

1190
01:09:58,217 --> 01:10:00,364
[This is her chance!
If he screams, then he's out!]

1191
01:10:02,918 --> 01:10:07,038
[He screamed out loud!]

1192
01:10:08,550 --> 01:10:15,212
<i>[Someone will die if they
scream out loud.]</i>

1193
01:10:16,036 --> 01:10:19,575
[Ha Ha screams out loud at her
surprise attack!]

1194
01:10:21,438 --> 01:10:23,242
I'm sorry.

1195
01:10:23,243 --> 01:10:25,093
<i>I told you not to scream.</i>

1196
01:10:25,094 --> 01:10:27,072
[I told you not to scream.]

1197
01:10:27,073 --> 01:10:30,496
What... what was I?
I wasn't supposed to scream?

1198
01:10:30,497 --> 01:10:36,428
[You are to be taken out
for having screamed out loud.]

1199
01:10:36,429 --> 01:10:39,929
Suzy... seriously...
you could've been my fate.

1200
01:10:39,930 --> 01:10:41,992
[Cursed by the scream, Ha Ha is out!]

1201
01:10:44,487 --> 01:10:46,763
<i>I told you not to scream.</i>

1202
01:10:47,944 --> 01:10:49,501
I wonder if Ha Ha's been ousted?

1203
01:10:50,450 --> 01:10:53,087
I'm so scared of that voice.

1204
01:10:55,084 --> 01:10:57,501
[So Suzy pulled it off?]

1205
01:10:57,502 --> 01:11:01,284
[I have to make Kwang Soo turn around
and look behind him.]

1206
01:11:07,199 --> 01:11:11,612
<i>[Someone will die if they turn around
to look back.]</i>

1207
01:11:13,398 --> 01:11:14,571
What the heck?

1208
01:11:16,782 --> 01:11:20,283
[Smacked in the back of the head,
and fully turning to look behind him.]

1209
01:11:21,131 --> 01:11:22,593
What the heck?

1210
01:11:22,594 --> 01:11:24,127
[So sorry!]

1211
01:11:24,128 --> 01:11:28,756
[Even though it was a bit unconventional,
it was a very effective way to oust him!]

1212
01:11:28,757 --> 01:11:31,800
I haven't looked behind me even once
for the past five hours.

1213
01:11:32,223 --> 01:11:34,553
But did I really look back just because
you smacked me on the back of my head?

1214
01:11:34,554 --> 01:11:37,253
- I hit you too hard, didn't I?
- Did I look behind me?

1215
01:11:37,254 --> 01:11:39,619
You turned around and
looked at me.

1216
01:11:40,509 --> 01:11:42,052
Wait a minute.
That's me?

1217
01:11:42,465 --> 01:11:43,779
Wait!

1218
01:11:44,485 --> 01:11:46,780
- Wait!
- Kwang Soo, I'm so sorry.

1219
01:11:46,781 --> 01:11:48,293
Wait a minute.

1220
01:11:48,717 --> 01:11:50,974
Wait!
Let me hit her just once before I go!

1221
01:11:51,734 --> 01:11:54,969
[One very pissed off Giraffe!]

1222
01:11:54,970 --> 01:11:57,232
Do you know how badly I've been wanting
to look behind me all night?

1223
01:11:57,811 --> 01:12:00,825
I've been waiting all this time...
and couldn't even look behind me!

1224
01:12:00,826 --> 01:12:03,810
- Kwang Soo, I'm so sorry.
- You have no idea all that I've done!

1225
01:12:04,301 --> 01:12:06,235
I even wrapped a box
around my neck!

1226
01:12:08,917 --> 01:12:14,148
[Whatever the case, the older sister ghost
eliminates the Giraffe with one smooth smack.]

1227
01:12:23,030 --> 01:12:26,334
[The two ghosts exuberant hi-five.]

1228
01:12:27,531 --> 01:12:29,646
So this is how scary two women
working together can be?

1229
01:12:29,647 --> 01:12:33,139
This is seriously...
this is amazing teamwork between us.

1230
01:12:33,140 --> 01:12:37,390
The only ones left right now are
Jae Suk, Gary and Suk Jin.

1231
01:12:37,391 --> 01:12:40,521
- We only have three more left to get rid of.
- Three more to go.

1232
01:12:40,522 --> 01:12:43,146
The problem is that we still don't know
what Suk Jin is yet.

1233
01:12:43,147 --> 01:12:45,382
- So Gary is water?
- Gary's the water.

1234
01:12:45,736 --> 01:12:49,588
- He's very sentimental...
- And he likes to get wet in the rain.

1235
01:12:50,150 --> 01:12:52,183
He really is very sentimental.

1236
01:12:54,264 --> 01:12:57,660
[The men that are still left alive...]

1237
01:12:57,661 --> 01:12:58,950
Hey, Jae Suk.

1238
01:12:58,951 --> 01:13:01,476
- Can we look behind now?
- It doesn't matter anymore.

1239
01:13:02,411 --> 01:13:05,249
- I feel so much freer.
- That's so much better.

1240
01:13:05,250 --> 01:13:06,526
[Turning around to look behind them
for the first time in hours.]

1241
01:13:06,527 --> 01:13:09,938
[And screaming out as loud
as they want.]

1242
01:13:09,939 --> 01:13:11,120
So what happened?

1243
01:13:11,121 --> 01:13:13,842
Someone got ousted from screaming,
and someone got ousted from looking back.

1244
01:13:13,843 --> 01:13:16,697
- Ha Ha's got ousted from screaming.
- Really? It was Ha Ha?

1245
01:13:16,698 --> 01:13:18,665
- Really?
- Then what else is there?

1246
01:13:18,666 --> 01:13:20,730
- Being made ugly.
- Ji Hyo and Suzy are still left.

1247
01:13:20,731 --> 01:13:23,033
- Gary and myself...
- And Suk Jin.

1248
01:13:23,034 --> 01:13:27,597
So there are five of us still left?
But there aren't five curses left.

1249
01:13:28,768 --> 01:13:30,585
Then it means there's a couple
working together.

1250
01:13:30,586 --> 01:13:31,916
Amongst us?

1251
01:13:31,917 --> 01:13:33,376
- That's right.
- A pair?

1252
01:13:33,377 --> 01:13:36,026
Don't you think that a pair is
working together to oust all the others?

1253
01:13:36,027 --> 01:13:39,452
- A pair working together to oust others?
- Two people working together.

1254
01:13:39,453 --> 01:13:41,847
- That's possible.
- If there's a couple...

1255
01:13:41,848 --> 01:13:44,232
- Are you a couple?
- There could be a couple already.

1256
01:13:44,602 --> 01:13:46,900
- Is it you?
- No, it's not me.

1257
01:13:47,894 --> 01:13:49,837
That's what you always say.

1258
01:13:50,226 --> 01:13:52,324
- You're acting strange.
- You always tell us that it's not you.

1259
01:13:52,325 --> 01:13:55,153
- And you always scratch right here.
- Why are you scratching your neck?

1260
01:13:55,154 --> 01:13:56,473
It's not me.

1261
01:13:57,574 --> 01:14:00,592
Then the only thing that's left is getting
ousted from being ugly.

1262
01:14:00,593 --> 01:14:03,824
[So it's essential to find out what
other curses could still be left.]

1263
01:14:03,825 --> 01:14:07,268
[And wait... one more thing.
The lockers!]

1264
01:14:09,727 --> 01:14:11,141
What is it?

1265
01:14:11,142 --> 01:14:13,528
It's somewhere around here.
I haven't found anything yet.

1266
01:14:13,529 --> 01:14:15,568
I was here with Ha Ha earlier.

1267
01:14:16,069 --> 01:14:17,576
Set, go.

1268
01:14:17,577 --> 01:14:20,811
Mirror, mirror...
Are we the fated couple?

1269
01:14:20,812 --> 01:14:23,620
[Mirror, mirror...
Are we the fated couple?]

1270
01:14:23,621 --> 01:14:26,930
[No, you're not.]

1271
01:14:27,442 --> 01:14:29,490
Then who are the fated couple?

1272
01:14:30,866 --> 01:14:37,491
<i>[Someone... will die if both of their feet
touches the ground at the same time.]</i>

1273
01:14:37,492 --> 01:14:39,352
What is this all about?

1274
01:14:39,353 --> 01:14:43,562
<i>[Someone... will die if both of their feet
touches the ground at the same time?]</i>

1275
01:14:46,091 --> 01:14:51,603
<i>Someone... will die if both of their feet
touches the ground at the same time.</i>

1276
01:14:56,111 --> 01:15:01,545
<i>Someone... will die if both of their feet
touches the ground at the same time.</i>

1277
01:15:02,879 --> 01:15:04,649
So he has to keep standing
around like this?

1278
01:15:04,650 --> 01:15:05,693
Who does?

1279
01:15:05,694 --> 01:15:07,935
That can only be Suk Jin.

1280
01:15:07,936 --> 01:15:12,036
- Then I bet he has to do that now?
- So he has to walk around like this.

1281
01:15:12,037 --> 01:15:13,757
Then how are we going to do this?

1282
01:15:14,585 --> 01:15:18,177
<i>Someone... will die if both of their feet
touches the ground at the same time.</i>

1283
01:15:18,178 --> 01:15:20,432
[Automatically lifts his foot off the ground.]

1284
01:15:26,229 --> 01:15:28,713
There's a chair over there.
I can get around on the chair.

1285
01:15:30,161 --> 01:15:31,337
Okay, I got it.

1286
01:15:32,969 --> 01:15:34,939
I have a feeling that it's me.

1287
01:15:38,827 --> 01:15:42,540
[Little sister ghost chasing after Jae Suk!]

1288
01:15:42,541 --> 01:15:46,193
[Seems as though she's planning on taking
his glasses off to make him uglier!]

1289
01:15:50,529 --> 01:15:52,055
- Suk Jin.
- What is it?

1290
01:15:52,589 --> 01:15:54,051
Suzy's coming.

1291
01:15:55,719 --> 01:16:00,017
[Suzy discovers Big-nosed Brother
standing around on only one foot.]

1292
01:16:01,446 --> 01:16:02,896
Suzy scares me.

1293
01:16:02,897 --> 01:16:05,663
I think Suzy's trying to take off
my glasses right now.

1294
01:16:06,867 --> 01:16:08,183
Suzy!
Hurry!

1295
01:16:08,184 --> 01:16:11,363
[Gary works together with Suzy
to attack Suk Jin!]

1296
01:16:11,364 --> 01:16:13,047
- It's not you?
- No, it's not me!

1297
01:16:15,726 --> 01:16:18,346
[Suk Jin is ousted once both of his feet
touches the ground at the same time!]

1298
01:16:18,347 --> 01:16:21,633
[Desperately trying to avoid having both
of his feet touch the ground.]

1299
01:16:22,768 --> 01:16:25,902
[Little sister ghost Suzy accepting
the help offered by Gary.]

1300
01:16:25,903 --> 01:16:28,919
[Absolute and utter chaos.]

1301
01:16:28,920 --> 01:16:31,006
Just a little bit more!

1302
01:16:35,152 --> 01:16:38,014
[Stepping on one of his feet!]

1303
01:16:42,540 --> 01:16:46,051
[Both of his feet...
touched the ground at the same time!]

1304
01:16:46,052 --> 01:16:48,777
[Both of his feet make a touchdown!]

1305
01:16:49,818 --> 01:16:54,838
<i>[Someone... will die if both of their feet
touches the ground at the same time.]</i>

1306
01:16:55,442 --> 01:16:56,942
I'm still okay.

1307
01:16:57,458 --> 01:16:59,416
- Oh, it's Suk Jin!
- It's me. That's my curse.

1308
01:17:00,329 --> 01:17:02,534
- Are you seriously going to do this?
- I'm sorry, Suk Jin.

1309
01:17:04,824 --> 01:17:07,070
We have to end this game somehow.

1310
01:17:07,071 --> 01:17:09,638
[The curse of two feet...
Ji Suk Jin- Out!]

1311
01:17:18,382 --> 01:17:22,055
[After having eliminated Suk Jin,
Gary is back to searching the lockers.]

1312
01:17:22,056 --> 01:17:24,335
I have to remain calm
as to not to make any mistakes.

1313
01:17:25,698 --> 01:17:26,978
Search through these one by one.

1314
01:17:28,598 --> 01:17:34,420
[Just where is the locker that
the mirror told me to find?]

1315
01:17:34,421 --> 01:17:36,776
I wonder if Ji Hyo's found it
already by now.

1316
01:17:37,437 --> 01:17:40,114
Ji Hyo and I are the only ones
who know about that hint.

1317
01:17:44,480 --> 01:17:48,144
[Checking through all of the lockers!]

1318
01:18:03,193 --> 01:18:04,538
I found it.

1319
01:18:07,772 --> 01:18:12,776
<i>[Stick this on the name tag of the deceased,
and the power will be activated.]</i>

1320
01:18:12,777 --> 01:18:14,364
What's this?

1321
01:18:14,365 --> 01:18:20,193
[Stick it on the name tag of the deceased?]

1322
01:18:22,718 --> 01:18:24,400
Hang on, what's this?

1323
01:18:31,254 --> 01:18:33,937
I'm positive the girls were there before,
but both the girls have disappeared.

1324
01:18:33,938 --> 01:18:36,825
[Discovers the picture
with the girls missing in it!]

1325
01:18:36,826 --> 01:18:40,230
I'm positive that we all took
the picture together five years ago.

1326
01:18:40,231 --> 01:18:41,875
What happened?

1327
01:18:42,505 --> 01:18:46,237
[Not found in any other pictures either...]

1328
01:18:47,678 --> 01:18:49,827
What the heck is this?
They're ghosts?

1329
01:18:50,618 --> 01:18:52,745
Are they seriously haunted spirits?

1330
01:18:54,250 --> 01:18:56,668
They've been ghosts this whole time?

1331
01:18:56,669 --> 01:19:00,494
[They've been ghosts this whole time?]

1332
01:19:02,233 --> 01:19:05,878
[The girls were ghosts from
the beginning...]

1333
01:19:11,049 --> 01:19:12,397
- Jae Suk.
- Gary!

1334
01:19:12,398 --> 01:19:13,952
- Hurry up and come over here.
- Why?

1335
01:19:13,953 --> 01:19:15,457
- I'm scared to death right now.
- Why?

1336
01:19:17,289 --> 01:19:19,112
- I have goosebumps all over my body.
- Why?

1337
01:19:19,113 --> 01:19:21,488
I found a hint earlier.

1338
01:19:21,808 --> 01:19:25,516
I was told to search the lockers,
and that's what I've been doing.

1339
01:19:27,739 --> 01:19:29,957
Remember how we were all there for
the group picture five years ago?

1340
01:19:29,958 --> 01:19:31,625
- Yeah, so?
- But the two are missing.

1341
01:19:33,226 --> 01:19:35,090
Then they're ghosts?

1342
01:19:36,456 --> 01:19:38,787
I'm so scared.
Look at all of my goosebumps.

1343
01:19:39,601 --> 01:19:41,357
- Those two are ghosts?
- Yes!

1344
01:19:45,753 --> 01:19:47,781
- Jae Suk...
- What's this?

1345
01:19:48,271 --> 01:19:50,628
- That's a different class.
- Oh, it's a different class?

1346
01:19:50,629 --> 01:19:52,196
That startled me.

1347
01:19:52,197 --> 01:19:55,220
- I noticed that Sa Yeon's our classmate too.
- You're right.

1348
01:19:55,221 --> 01:19:57,890
- Jin Young's in there too.
- Yeah, and Min Soo's our classmate too.

1349
01:19:57,891 --> 01:20:00,484
I think we can use casual speech with him
the next time we see him now.

1350
01:20:02,841 --> 01:20:05,506
- But this sticker...
- I have this too.

1351
01:20:05,933 --> 01:20:08,598
- But this sticker...
- I have this too.

1352
01:20:09,823 --> 01:20:12,003
- You have one too?
- Ha Ha gave it to me.

1353
01:20:13,637 --> 01:20:16,995
[Ha Ha had one of the stickers?]

1354
01:20:18,959 --> 01:20:21,911
[Ha Ha having gone to the mirror room
along with Jae Suk.]

1355
01:20:22,666 --> 01:20:24,508
[No, you're not.]

1356
01:20:25,983 --> 01:20:27,612
Is there another message?

1357
01:20:27,613 --> 01:20:31,417
<i>[But search through all of
the potted plants.]</i>

1358
01:20:33,058 --> 01:20:38,450
[From one of the potted plants...
Ha Ha finds the sticker!]

1359
01:20:41,358 --> 01:20:45,624
[The exact same sticker that Gary
found in one of the lockers!]

1360
01:20:46,168 --> 01:20:47,863
What is this?

1361
01:20:48,813 --> 01:20:52,376
<i>[Stick it on the name tag of the deceased,
and its powers will be activated.]</i>

1362
01:20:55,552 --> 01:20:58,520
You got ousted from having screamed out loud?
What's this?

1363
01:20:59,327 --> 01:21:03,568
[Ha Ha hands his sticker off to Jae Suk!]

1364
01:21:05,079 --> 01:21:07,116
I think we're supposed to put these
stickers on the ghosts.

1365
01:21:10,273 --> 01:21:14,537
[Are they amulets that can stop the
ghosts if they're stuck on them?]

1366
01:21:14,538 --> 01:21:17,737
- Just like those Gangsi movies...
- So that's why we need two.

1367
01:21:17,738 --> 01:21:22,579
So then one of us is the ugly curse
while the other is the water curse?

1368
01:21:25,672 --> 01:21:30,170
- Let's go, Gary.
- Hang on. I'm so creeped out right now.

1369
01:21:30,171 --> 01:21:33,469
[Creeped out at the knowledge about
having been around ghosts all day.]

1370
01:21:34,129 --> 01:21:37,861
- This isn't going to be easy.
- Where are we supposed to stick this?

1371
01:21:37,862 --> 01:21:41,564
[Ghosts are going to know what's going on
as soon as they see the amulet.]

1372
01:21:41,565 --> 01:21:43,331
So they're ghosts?

1373
01:21:49,202 --> 01:21:50,620
- Hey, Suzy.
- Suzy!

1374
01:21:53,478 --> 01:21:56,104
- What are you doing up there?
- I'm just thirsty.

1375
01:21:56,105 --> 01:21:58,750
[A cup of water in her hand
that could kill Gary!]

1376
01:21:58,751 --> 01:22:00,620
- Where's Ji Hyo?
- Excuse me?

1377
01:22:00,621 --> 01:22:02,969
- Where's Ji Hyo?
- Ji Hyo?

1378
01:22:03,292 --> 01:22:05,075
- Should I come down there?
- Okay.

1379
01:22:05,464 --> 01:22:07,555
- Should we go up there?
- We'll come up there.

1380
01:22:07,556 --> 01:22:08,796
- We'll come up.
- Okay.

1381
01:22:08,797 --> 01:22:10,930
We have to get it on the first try.

1382
01:22:10,931 --> 01:22:16,314
[Only one chance!
Each take one ghost to get rid of!]

1383
01:22:18,696 --> 01:22:20,412
Let's hope that we can
do it in one try.

1384
01:22:20,413 --> 01:22:22,125
Let's please end this in one try.

1385
01:22:22,722 --> 01:22:25,064
The more we drag it out...

1386
01:22:31,410 --> 01:22:32,850
Where did Suzy go?

1387
01:22:33,839 --> 01:22:35,399
Where's Ji Hyo?

1388
01:22:37,221 --> 01:22:40,730
[Suzy's going into some room?]

1389
01:22:41,406 --> 01:22:44,756
[Too afraid to get too close.]

1390
01:22:44,757 --> 01:22:50,474
[Even more terrifying because they
don't see the older sister ghost.]

1391
01:22:51,560 --> 01:22:53,496
- Do you want some water, Gary?
- Okay.

1392
01:22:54,214 --> 01:22:55,808
Here's some water.

1393
01:22:55,809 --> 01:22:58,064
- I've been drinking out of this cup though.
- It's okay.

1394
01:22:58,065 --> 01:23:01,759
- Why do you keep trying to give me the water?
- I just thought that you might be thirsty.

1395
01:23:03,484 --> 01:23:05,245
Rinse it off once before giving it to me.

1396
01:23:07,803 --> 01:23:12,058
[Something definitely is going on!]

1397
01:23:12,059 --> 01:23:13,714
Is someone back there?

1398
01:23:16,944 --> 01:23:20,278
[Of course... there is!]

1399
01:23:23,288 --> 01:23:26,075
[He avoided it?]

1400
01:23:26,076 --> 01:23:27,728
I didn't get any on me!

1401
01:23:31,384 --> 01:23:33,452
[This is my chance!]

1402
01:23:34,704 --> 01:23:40,930
[But... Suzy dumps her water on Gary!]

1403

[Jae Suk attacks older sister ghost
with the amulet in hand!]

1406
01:23:56,677 --> 01:23:58,346
I have to stick this on you!

1407
01:24:00,214 --> 01:24:02,440
[The glasses!]

1408
01:24:03,782 --> 01:24:06,440
[No! That makes me ugly!]

1409
01:24:06,441 --> 01:24:11,931
<i>[Someone will die if
they're made to look ugly.]</i>

1410
01:24:13,668 --> 01:24:17,370
[He looks ugly...]

1411
01:24:20,505 --> 01:24:22,156
He looks ugly!

1412
01:24:22,157 --> 01:24:25,080
[Water cursed Gary is ousted
from having gotten wet.]

1413
01:24:25,081 --> 01:24:28,370
[Jae Suk is ousted from having been
cursed with the ugliness.]

1414
01:24:28,371 --> 01:24:30,892
I didn't know I was supposed to
stick this on her name tag.

1415
01:24:30,893 --> 01:24:32,802
Suzy, we won!

1416
01:24:32,803 --> 01:24:34,960
- Are you ousted too?
- My destiny!

1417
01:24:34,961 --> 01:24:37,260
