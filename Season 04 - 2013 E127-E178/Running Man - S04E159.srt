00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:14,500
[FD Jae Chul from the
Tuesday evening show, Hwasin.]

28
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:17,050
- Do all the FD's look alike?
- How can they look so much alike?

29
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:19,800
- Are all the couples going to look alike?

00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:22,320

[Self-proclaimed master of the variety world,

00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,290
It's Kwang Gyu.

00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,140
- It's Kwang Gyu.
- That's his partner?

41
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:57,560
Why are you seriously doing
this to me?

00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:02,000
[The party atmosphere
taking major downturn.]

43
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,340
- Kwang Gyu?
- That's a nice partner you've got there!

44
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:06,620
- What's with the dour atmosphere?
- It's nice to see you.

45
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:08,170
It's because of you!

46
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:11,050
I thought that Suk Jin
was going to be my partner.

47
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:14,600
- So that you could be the young blood?
- I thought I'd be the younger of the two.

48
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,820
What are you saying?
You're saying you're the young blood?

49
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:21,270
[Bright and shiny as the sun?]

50
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:25,060

[Self-proclaimed master of variety
showing his greed for Suk Jin's spot.]

52
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:33,030
This is going to drive me crazy.
He thinks he looks younger than me.

53
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:37,380
It's time for a trade.
It's time for Suk Jin to take a rest.

54
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:40,700
- Next, we'll welcome Ha Ha's partner.
- Ha Ha.

55
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:43,150

[With the way this is going,
will it really be the tuna sister?]

00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:49,660
Who is it?

58
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:54,950
- Who is it?
- Is that Sa Yuri?

59
00:02:55,750 --> 00:03:00,060
[Woman with a 4 dimensional personality,

61
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:07,590
Hey, Sa Yuri!

00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:10,000
Look at the way she's walking!
She's already walking like this!

63
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,950
Watch your steps.

64
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:15,330
- Yuri, are you two friends?
- Yes, we're friends. We're the same age.

65
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:16,780
- Really?
- Yes.

66
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,810
Even though Yuri has been paired up
with Ha Ha on this episode

67
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:24,480
is there anyone else that you wanted
to be paired up with instead of Ha Ha?

68
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,640
- Yes, there is!
- Who?

69
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,490
- Kim Jong Kook.
- Why?

70
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:30,190
I really like him.
Everything about him is just so loveable.

71
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:33,580
- Why?
- I don't know, but he's just so delectable.

72
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:35,260
- He's delectable?
- Yes.

73
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:39,860
- What are you talking about?
- Ha Ha, you should step aside and concede.

74
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:43,740
- Is it my turn now?
- Seeing who our guests have been so far...

75
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:46,700
- It's time for a pretty girl guest.
- What if it's someone from a girl group?

76
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:48,360
It's so hard to predict who it could be.

77
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:51,890
[Full of anticipation.
Please... come on out.]

78
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:54,680
[Peek-a-boo!]

79
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:58,200
[Heavyweight actor, Park Sang Myun.]

80
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:02,230
It's Myun Sang.
Look, it's Myun Sang.

81
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,980
What is this?
Sang Myun is my partner?

82
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:07,880
It's Myun Sang.
Park Myun Sang!

83
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,260
[Looking dapper for the party?]

84
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:14,580
[As a continuation from the last time,
partnering up with his friend again?]

85
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:17,180
Why do we keep getting partnered up
when we don't even like each other?

86
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:20,440
- It's nice to meet you.
- How do you and Kwang Gyu know each other?

87
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:23,510
We both made our debuts
in the same movie a long time ago.

88
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:27,390
[They made their debuts in the same movie?]

89
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:30,560
Look at how happy he is with that comment.
He really likes that.

90
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,100
- Look at how happy he is.
- I thought that he was older than me.

91
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:37,080
I thought that he was older than me.

92
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:40,270
But I came to find out...
he and I are the same age.

93
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:46,030
He just looks older than his age.

94
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:47,820
- You two are the same age?
- Yeah, we're the same age.

95
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:50,090
- But he's younger than me.
- Yeah, he's a year younger than you.

96
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:52,730
- But you and I are friends?
- How that works is...

97
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:55,530
- Have you been deceiving me this whole time?
- It's because of our birthdays.

98
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:57,520
- Get down on your knees!
- But my birthday is very early.

99
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,110
I'm just going to go home.

100
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:03,090
- So how old are you then?
- I think I've gained too much weight.

101
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:04,690
[Changing the subject...]

102
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,100
[Avoiding the sensitive topic.]

103
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:12,510
Look at how nervous he's become
since they started discussing their age.

104
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:15,380
Next, we'll welcome
Lee Kwang Soo's partner.

105
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:18,010
[Asian Prince, Kwang Soo's partner.]

106
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:19,650
It's possible that his partner will be a girl.

107
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:22,000
[Seeing how the guests are of similar age,
he could have a younger girl partner?]

108
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:25,220
- Kwang Soo's partner is going to be a girl.
- Come on out.

109
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:31,410
[Who could it be?]

110
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:37,000
It's a very tall person.

111
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:42,660
[The rising star of variety, John Park.]

112
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:47,330
[The rising star garnering much attention
since having debuted in the audition show.]

113
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:50,380
[A singer with boyish good looks
and heartfelt voice.]

114
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:52,720
- It's John Park!
- John Park?

115
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:55,980
- It's another Kwang Soo!
- They're very similar.

116
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:59,980
John park is the newest rising star
in the variety world!

117
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,440
- He's so tall.
- Hello.

118
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:04,290
I feel like I'm looking at another
Kwang Soo.

119
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:07,140
[The two look-alikes greet one another.]

120
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:10,970
John Park is pretty quirky himself.

121
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:13,990
- I wanted to be Kwang Soo's partner.
- Why?

122
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:17,220
- I felt like we'd really get along well.
- Why do you think that?

123
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:19,540
Why?
Is it wrong of me to think that?

124
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:24,500
[Oddball John Park...]

125
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,320
- Kwang Soo's done for today.
- I think today's going to be fun.

126
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:29,950
I can't wait to see who's going to
be the weirder one today.

127
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:32,900
- I don't want to lose to him.
- You have to bring out your A game.

128
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,750
Then there's only Ji Hyo
and one other person left.

129
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:38,200
- I'm sure Gary will be with Ji Hyo.
- I'm excited to see who it'll be myself.

130
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:41,620
- Get out there and greet your partner.
- Who do you think it'll be?

131
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,020
This one is for you!

132
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:46,650
I knew this was going to happen!

133
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,750
Ji Hyo is the best of the lot here!

134
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:53,910
[Miss Blank makes her entrance.]

135
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,920
Ji Hyo is the best out of the lot today.

136
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:59,240
- Ji Hyo really is the best today.
- Ji Hyo is the best of the lot today.

137
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,610
You need to feel honored.

138
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:05,780
I'm still saving you like this
even though today is Tuesday.

139
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:08,380
- You two look good together.
- You guys look really good together.

140
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:10,790
- They really look good together.
- Why do I feel like I'm being led?

141
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:12,790
<i>Next up is Kim Jong Kook's partner.</i>

142
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:15,710
[Then who's going to be Kkuk's partner?]

143
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:17,630
Who could it be?

144
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:25,400
[Who... who is that?]

145
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:32,200
[All Right- Kim Ye Rim.]

146
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:37,050
[Having garnered much attention on the
show with her dream-like voice.]

147
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:39,740
[New rising star, Kim Ye Rim,
having made a recent solo debut.]

148
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:41,540
- How did you get so lucky?
- Hello.

149
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:43,400
Why is Jong Kook the only one?

150
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:46,560
- Hello.
- Why did Jong Kook get Ye Rim?

151
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:49,800
- Why are you doing this to us?
- Are they friends?

152
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,250
- All right!
- Hello.

153

What the heck is this?
They have similar hair color.

154

- What are you talking about?
- They actually look good together.

155
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:01,470
- I can't believe Ye Rim is here.
- Hello.

156
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,970
- Look at him. There he goes again.
- Why are you taking your sunglasses off?

157
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:07,960
- Why are you taking off your sunglasses?
- We have to be able to see each other.

158
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:10,350
- Seriously!

159
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:13,350
- There's someone else waiting in the back.
- There are more guests?

160
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:15,470
You're saying we have more guests
waiting to come out?

161
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:19,180
Who is it?

162
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:26,270
[Jo Jung Chi and Jung In!]

163
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:28,220
- What is this?
- Jo Jung Chi?

164
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:30,500
- Jo Jung Chi and Jung In are here?
- What are those two doing here?

165
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,400
Aren't they a real life couple?

166
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:36,040
What is Jung Chi wearing?
What's with that jacket?

167
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:38,270
Why don't you two hold
each other's hands?

168
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,780
Going on various variety shows
are their usual dates.

169
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:43,710
Why don't you help her out?
She's having trouble walking in her heels!

170
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:45,880
- Why don't you give her some support?
- It's hard enough for me to walk myself.

171
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:48,000
Why don't you hold onto her
and give her some support?

172
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:51,370
[Anyway, welcome to the show.]

173
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:56,780
- Why are we being partnered up again?
- Why?

174
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:58,260
[Jung In unhappy with her partner?]

175
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:00,790
- You want someone else here as your partner?
- Yes.

176
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,530
Kwang Soo.

177
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,370
- He's mine.
- Why am I yours?

178
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:07,890
- Why am I yours?
- You should feel honored.

179
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,440
- This is really...
- This is a very strange setting today.

180
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:16,060
At this rate, I wouldn't be surprised if
Jo Gap Gyung and Hong Seo Beom came out.

181
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:19,160
This really feels like...

182
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:21,060
This feels really surreal today.

183
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:31,130
[A surreal combination...]

184
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:32,680
What's going on today?

185
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:37,130
We're going to have a couple race today where
you will be paired off in teams of two.

186
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:42,020
The title of today's race is...
'Couple, 1% of friendship.'

187
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:43,530
[Couple, 1% of friendship.]

188
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:48,670
You'll find out for yourself why today's race
is titled, 'Couple, 1% of friendship.'

189
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:52,780
First, I need one member of each team to step
forward and receive an item from me.

190
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:54,370
What are we getting?

191
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:57,040
- Isn't that gold?
- Oh, it's gold.

192
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,070
It's gold.

193
00:09:58,070 --> 00:10:00,750
- Is it a cellphone?
- No, it's real gold!

194
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:03,020
Is it real?

195
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:06,460
Wow, it's real gold!

196
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:08,440
It's real gold.

197
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:10,980
- Are you giving this to us?
- This is real?

198
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:14,330
- You're in a better mood now, aren't you?
- Yeah, I like it!

199
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:17,060
This is my first time seeing
gold like this.

200
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:18,680
- This is your first time?
- This is real gold.

201
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:21,060
- I've never seen a gold bar.
- Awesome.

202
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:24,580
<i>If you come in at the top in each
of your missions</i>

203
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:27,790
<i>you'll then receive additional gold bars.</i>

204
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:33,580
<i>In other words, you'll get a chance to take
your opponent's gold bars away from them.</i>

205
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:38,530
<i>The team that has the most number of
gold bars at the final mission</i>

206
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:40,990
<i>will receive an unbelievable advantage
for their team.</i>

207
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:44,380
<i>The first place winner can't have
their gold taken away from them.</i>

208
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:48,130
<i>I ask for each team to place their love
and friendship on the line and do their best.</i>

209
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:51,890
<i>And also, you will all be responsible
for the care of your own gold bars.</i>

210
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:56,410
<i>No one can help you if you lose, or have
your gold stolen from you along the way.</i>

211
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:57,970
<i>So if you lose it, then it's gone for good.</i>

212
00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:00,040
<i>We will not keep it for you.</i>

213
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:02,360
<i>Each team will be
responsible for their own gold.</i>

214
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:04,470
<i>Even when you win yourselves
additional gold bars</i>

215
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:07,590
<i>you need to discuss with your partner
about who will take possession of the gold</i>

216
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:11,290
<i>and make sure to keep the bars safe
with you until the final mission.</i>

217
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:17,390
[Each team putting their gold bars
in a pouch for safe keeping.]

218
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:20,110
- Did you both agree?
- Yes.

219
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,740
<i>Okay, everyone to their cars.</i>

220
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:28,670
[1% of friendship- The unlikely couples'
adventures are about to start.]

221
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:30,620
[Go to 'S' chicken soup restaurant.]

222
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:32,560
- This isn't it, right?
- No, it's in Sangshi.

223
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,570
Sangshi.

224
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:36,000
These two are riding with us because
neither one of them has a license.

225
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,920
- Really?
- Thank you.

226
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:43,610
Kwang Gyu looked at Ye Rim so warmly
when he greeted her earlier.

227
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:46,020
- He did?
- The way he greeted her was different.

228
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:49,260
No, that's not what happened!
It was Jung Chi who did that!

229
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:52,730
Ye Rim has become a mainstay
at our company, so everyone is...

230
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:57,240
That's right. Ye Rim is making
all the money for Jong Shin lately.

231
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,760
Really?

232
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:01,970
I'm the main bread winner for
my company too.

233
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:04,130
- You are?
- Yeah.

234
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,190
I guess they don't require much
to live then.

235
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,570
I think this is going to be
good today.

236
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:16,200
- Me too.
- I think it's going to be so much fun.

237
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:19,210
A lot of people have been calling me
an idiot these days too.

238
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:21,790
Hey!
Did you just call me an idiot?

239
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,330
No, that's not what I was saying.

240
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:25,540
[The subdued Idiot Couple,
Kwang and Park.]

241
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:28,960
- You pretty much just called me an idiot.
- But aren't you kind of like that?

242
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,030
[Hitting it on the mark?]

243
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:32,840
- Goofy.
- Goofy can be cute though.

244
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:35,060
- Yes.
- Then don't refer to yourself as an idiot.

245
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:36,780
- We're not idiots.
- We're not idiots.

246
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:39,650
We're just a little different from others.
That's all.

247
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:40,940
- Kwang!
- Park!

248
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:42,510
- Cross!
- Cross!

249
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,100
I really want to win.

250
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:46,660
I'll make sure you do.
Let's win.

251
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:49,200
If we don't win,
let's not even keep in touch.

252
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:52,590
How can you say that?

253
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:55,720
- Sa Sa.
- Yeah, Ha Ha.

254
00:12:55,730 --> 00:13:00,170
- When are you going to get married?
- I want to get married within the next year.

255
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:01,840
- Do you have a boyfriend?
- No, I don't.

256
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:05,700
- Anyone you're interested in?
- Kim Jong Kook.

257
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:10,940
- Want me to set you up with Jong Kook?
- I need you to really make it happen.

258
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:14,220
I'll give you a tip. The type
of women that Jong Kook likes is...

259
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:18,050
He likes women who are modest,
and feminine.

260
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:20,560
You know those women who
laugh like this?

261
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:22,630
[Learning how to be modest.]

262
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,860
[Meanwhile...]

263
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:27,380
[Jong Kook is currently getting to know
another modest woman.]

264
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:29,890
- I heard that you're really young?
- I was born in 1994.

265
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:31,260
- '94?
- Yes.

266
00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:34,960
I made my debut in '95.

267
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:38,360
[The age difference is...]

268
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:48,350
Is that it?
We're here.

269
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:53,570
- Wow... look at that. Wow.
- Wow, look at that stream.

270
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:54,980
[Refreshing water stream.]

271
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:58,980
[And in there, is a
delicious chicken soup restaurant.]

272
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:04,890
We're the first to arrive!

273
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,670
[Ha Ha and Yuri also arrive.]

274
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,340
Chicken soup!

275
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:14,910
- I'm so hungry.
- Me too.

276
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:18,150
[While listening to the refreshing sound
of the water in the stream...]

277
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:20,710
[Chicken soup with all its nutrients...]

278
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:24,570
[Jae Suk, Kwang Gyu,
Jung Chi and Jung In also arrive.]

279
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:29,040
I need to get out too.

280
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:30,890
I'm so sorry.

[Real life couple's
consideration for each other.]

282
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:39,220
What are you doing?

283
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,940
Let's go.

284
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,980
Where do we have to go?

285
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:46,710
- Go into the room.
- In our own individual rooms?

286
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:49,520
What are we going to do in the room?

287
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,740
[Why...]

288
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:53,540
- Do we have to go in there too?
- Are we all going in here together?

289
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,770
Really?

290
00:14:56,770 --> 00:15:00,530
[Everyone into the first room.]

291
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:02,600
- Come on in.
- We're all going in here?

292
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,610
- Everyone in the same room?
- What's going on in here?

293
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:06,850
Aren't we going to get our own
individual rooms?

294
00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:08,930
He looks like duck restaurant owner.

295
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:11,750
[Shop owner with good humor.]

296
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:15,590
- Can we get three orders of the duck?
- Sure, whatever you want.

297
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:19,930
- Your duck...
- Your duck looks nice and plump.

298
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:24,820
[Feels like they're away
on a summer vacation...]

299
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:34,190
[Setting up thick mattresses
outside of their door?]

300
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:37,490
What did John Park and Kwang Soo
talk about in the car?

301
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:42,100
Even though John's very good looking,
his stare is still very much like Kwang Soo's.

302
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:46,950
[The idiot brothers?
Very similar vibe from the two...]

303
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:48,900
- He's the good looking idiot.
- And this one is the real idiot.

304
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:51,620
What?
I'm the real idiot?

305
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:55,070
[A lot of commotion going on
outside their door.]

306
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:59,050
During our drive here, Yuri and I
talked a lot about marriage.

307
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:02,010
We're going to pair her up with someone
in this room today.

308
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:03,550
- Are you older than me?
- Yes, I am.

309
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:06,080
I thought that Yuri was still
quite young.

310
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,920
I thought that she was
younger than me.

311
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,930
I'm being very sincere right now.
She really is a very good girl.

312
00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:13,270
Want to share
some chicken breast together?

313

'Want to share
some chicken breast together?'

314
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:20,820
Want to have a protein shake together?

315
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:24,260
[She's trying to share interests with
health obsessed Kkuk.]

316
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:25,630
Protein.

[The setup is now complete.]

318
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,690
This place is really small.

319

[Taking up the smallest amount of space
in the crowded room.]

320
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:41,140
- I didn't even realize that you were in here!
- I didn't even see you there!

get out there?

00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:38,070
- It's not fair to the women.
- That's right.

499
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:39,390
Let's go!

500
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:41,220
Let's get those guys out first.

501
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:48,230
[A steamy love scene
right in front of their eyes.]

502
00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:53,620
[Suk Jin and Sang Myun are eliminated!]

One more couple.
Play the music again.

505
00:28:02,370 --> 00:28:05,670
[Time to start dancing again
while keeping their eyes on each other.]

506
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:08,710
Both of you fell out at the same time.

507
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,220
[The two men livening up
the couple game.]

508

Please move over this way.

509
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:21,110
[The room door closes.]

510
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:22,790
Vacate the Room!

511
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:25,430
[Concentrating their attack on
brawny Kkuk.]

512
00:28:25,430 --> 00:28:27,940
[But they're pushed back!]

513
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:30,560

[An impossible situation in the room...]

518
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:51,830
If Sa Yuri gets kicked out of the room,
then Gary will stay in to the next round.

519
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:55,290
[Yuri's main objective is skinship with Kkuk
instead of staying in the game?]

520
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:57,390
What are you guys doing?

521
00:28:59,930 --> 00:29:03,060
[Requesting a fair game between
the women?]

522
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:07,340
The women can duke it out
amongst themselves.

523
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:10,520
- Ji Hyo!
- Only one of them needs to get ousted.

524

themselves working together.]

I'd like to reiterate the importance of
the men needing to meet the right women.

533
00:29:51,270 --> 00:29:52,850
You're the best, Yuri!

534
00:29:52,850 --> 00:29:55,800
- Ji Hyo!
- How could you have done that to Ye Rim?

535
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,120
[The last room is, Inkigayo Room.]

536
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:00,570
A gold bar will be given
to the winning couple.

537
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:01,700
- Really?
- Yes.

538
00:30:01,710 --> 00:30:03,690
A gold bar.
This is the final round!

539
00:30:03,690 --> 00:30:05,030
This is going to be a nice match.

540
00:30:05,330 --> 00:30:07,070
[The start of the final round.]

541
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:11,600
[But first, it's time to dance!]

[Unidentifiable dance moves.]

543
00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:24,810

when he was in his teens!]

00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:28,390
[Already grabbing his mic?]

545
00:30:30,810 --> 00:30:33,610
[Time for Kkuk's live performance!]

546
00:30:33,610 --> 00:30:35,180
It's a live performance!

547
00:30:39,150 --> 00:30:42,070
[A lively atmosphere with the original
singer of the song performing live.]

548
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:50,230
[Live performance that they haven't
seen in a very long time.]

549
00:30:58,220 --> 00:31:00,350
[Time is up.]

550
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,800
Live performance!

551
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:05,440
[He's still got it.]

552

[Time to determine
who the final couple will be.]

553
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:11,960
We have to grab him.
Ji Hyo!

554
00:31:13,850 --> 00:31:16,120
[Fierce physical battle.]

555
00:31:24,530 --> 00:31:27,170
The battle going on in there
is making the sky angry.

[Everyone escaping the sudden downpour
under the roof overhang.]

558
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:38,350
What if my hair gets wet?

559
00:31:40,370 --> 00:31:43,170
[A bloody battle paying no attention
to the weather outside.]

560
00:31:43,170 --> 00:31:45,290
Who's it going to be?

561
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,360
Who is it?

562
00:31:47,630 --> 00:31:50,410
[A competition that's impossible to predict.]

[Blank Ji with her brute strength
lifts Ha Ha up by his leg.]

564

[Moments before the fall.]

568
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,720

[Tenacious two couples.]

570
00:32:26,290 --> 00:32:29,240
[Ha Ha is eliminated.]

571
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:31,300
We still don't know the outcome
since Yuri is still in there.

572
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:33,760
[Now it's a two against one battle.]

573
00:32:35,670 --> 00:32:37,980
[Sa Yuri refusing with all her might.]

574
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:42,760
- She's kind of scary.
- Sorry, Yuri!

575
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:48,940
I'm sorry, Yuri!

576
00:32:49,690 --> 00:32:52,720

[Vacate the Room game-
Gary and Ji Hyo wins!]

578
00:32:56,380 --> 00:33:00,150
<i>Everyone must take care of their own gold.
You're all aware of how many bars you have?</i>

579
00:33:00,810 --> 00:33:03,950
<i>Okay, the first place couple can take
two of these gold bars.</i>

580
00:33:05,610 --> 00:33:07,760
<i>The couple that came in at second place
gets one gold bar.</i>

581

- Ha Ha, this is awesome!
- What about third place?

582
00:33:11,610 --> 00:33:13,210
Ji Hyo's going to hold onto
both the gold bars?

583
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:14,930
- Then Ha Ha will hold onto yours?
- Yes.

584
00:33:14,930 --> 00:33:18,490
You can find your next location in the car.
You may go onto your cars.

585
00:33:18,490 --> 00:33:20,240
[Off to the next location!]

586
00:33:22,170 --> 00:33:25,270
Wow... look at this sudden weather.
It's really windy too.

587
00:33:27,290 --> 00:33:30,140
- Are you okay?
- Of course. I didn't even do anything.

588
00:33:30,150 --> 00:33:32,120
What do you mean,
you didn't do anything?

589
00:33:34,790 --> 00:33:38,120
[A fascinating conversation of
a real life couple.]

590
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:41,150
But I had you around the waist.

591
00:33:41,150 --> 00:33:43,970
- I tried to grab you, but you kept avoiding.
- You should've done a better job of leading.

592
00:33:43,970 --> 00:33:47,000
- When did I do that?
- I was trying to grab you by the waist.

593
00:33:47,010 --> 00:33:50,250
The way I see it, you two are fighting over
something that doesn't even warrant a fight.

594
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:53,610
- You were trying to avoid me.
- Should we fight too?

595
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:56,620
- You really need to get married.
- Why are you bringing that up?

596
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:59,830
[Suddenly feeling sorry
for his 47 year old friend.]

597
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:02,000
- This is all part of our love.
- That's what I'm saying.

598
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:05,470
Are you trying to tease me?

599
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:08,390
- Seriously, Jung Chi.
- He's just speaking the truth.

600
00:34:08,390 --> 00:34:09,730
Couple Race.

601
00:34:09,730 --> 00:34:12,820
- Go to 'H' swimming pool.
- H?

602
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:13,840
H?

603
00:34:14,530 --> 00:34:17,210
[Off to the swimming pool...]

604
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:21,900
So we now have two gold bars.

605
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:24,430
I know.
We're one step ahead of the others.

606
00:34:24,430 --> 00:34:25,830
That's what I'm saying.

607
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:32,180
Why are you beeping your horn at us?

608
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:35,850
Aren't you guys the owners of
a local restaurant?

609
00:34:35,850 --> 00:34:38,520
- Huh? Aren't you restaurant owners?
- Yes, we are.

610
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:41,130

- Is it the four of you?
- Yes.

614

Four!
We've got four customers.

[The rain continuing to pour down.]

616
00:34:54,270 --> 00:34:58,080
[The point of their arrival is,
a pool at a traditional style pension.]

617
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:04,040
- What is this? This is scaring me.
- What is with the water guns?

618
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:05,890
Why are they holding those water guns?

619
00:35:05,890 --> 00:35:07,530
- What is that?
- Water guns.

620
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:11,100
We're here on our honeymoon.

621
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:13,690
[Looks like they're here on
a group honeymoon?]

622
00:35:13,690 --> 00:35:15,480
[Then is this a filial trip for his father?]

623
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:19,020
He hasn't been out in a while,
and he's enjoying all the fresh air.

624
00:35:22,610 --> 00:35:25,610
- The sky looks so clear.
- Doesn't it?

625
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:29,780
When you tilt your head back like that...
all the light reflects off your head.

626
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:32,050
That's not completely untrue either.

627
00:35:32,050 --> 00:35:34,540
Duck shop owner,
do you have a death wish?

628
00:35:37,330 --> 00:35:39,630
- Seriously!
- Calm down over there.

629
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:43,120
When the lightening struck earlier
we all jumped.

630
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:52,020
John Park, did you understand
this whole exchange just now?

631
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:54,900
Yes.
I'm not that dumb.

632
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:58,360
- He wasn't calling you dumb.
- That's not what I meant.

633
00:35:58,370 --> 00:36:00,060
Make him understand, Kwang Soo.

634
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:02,520
Explain to him what I was
trying to say.

635
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:05,720

- Which couple won the last game?
- We did.

641
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:29,470
<i>Kang Gary and Song Ji Hyo can name
the first two couples to start off the game.</i>

642
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:33,370
- But going first isn't always good.
- Hope it's not us.

643
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:36,630
You have to get rid of all the strong teams
in the beginning to make it easier later.

644
00:36:36,650 --> 00:36:40,840
We want Jae Suk and Kwang Gyu
to go up against Suk Jin and Sang Myun.

645
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:42,230
We just have to eliminate them.

646
00:36:44,110 --> 00:36:45,800
We have to eliminate them
from this game.

What should we go with?

650
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:54,990
- What?
- What should we use?

651
00:36:54,990 --> 00:36:56,540
Shiny bald head!

652
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:01,680
It's cute.

- Sparkle.
- How about 'Sparkle'?

- We'll go with 'Quack Quack'.
- Let's just stick with Kwang-Gyu!

657
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,980
- But people don't really know my name yet.
- What are you talking about?

658
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:15,310
- Why are you getting so worked up?
- What do you mean, your name is unknown?

I'm telling you that
people don't know my name!

660
00:37:16,910 --> 00:37:19,020
- Okay, we'll go with Kwang-Gyu.
- Let's go with Kwang-Gyu.

661
00:37:19,290 --> 00:37:22,110

'What are you doing, Father.'

662
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:26,150
[How absurd...]

663
00:37:26,150 --> 00:37:27,750
- Are we going to go with Quack-Quack?
- Yeah, I like that.

664
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:29,380
Here's your first question.

665
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:30,830
We're going to do this.

666
00:37:30,830 --> 00:37:33,470
- This is a friendship question.
- Friendship question?

667
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:36,440
You're all familiar with
the painter, Lee Jong Sup, right?

668
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:37,620
- Yes, of course!
- Yes, I do.

669
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:42,640
- Don't say anything out loud.
- It's a bull, not a cow.

670
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:45,630
- I love his paintings.
- It's not Lee Jung Sup?

671
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:51,880
- Isn't Lee Jung Sup a singer?
- No, that's Lee Jung Suk.

672
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:53,010
[That's singer, Lee Jung Suk.]

673
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:56,520
If this is how it's going to be,
then I'm pretty confident in this game.

674
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:59,560
The way I see it,
we're going to beat these two.

675
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:02,480
- Once these two are gone, it's all over.
- Okay, the painter, Lee Jong Sup.

676
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:05,310
When his friend was hospitalized

677
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:09,910
he had no money to help him out,
so he painted this as a gift instead.

678
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:13,420
- Which painting is this referring to?
- Lee Jung Sop painted it as a gift?

679
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:15,170
When his friend was hospitalized?

680
00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:17,030
- Can we be the one to shoot them?
- Would you like to?

681
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:19,380
- Can we shoot them ourselves?
- Why are you doing that?

682
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:24,160
Ye Rim was so excited by the idea
that she ran over here to take her seat.

683
00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:25,230
[Trading out with other shooters.]

684
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:26,540
Kwang-Gyu!

685
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:29,320
Rice!
He painted, rice!

686
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:35,310
[Shot in the face with the water gun.]

687
00:38:35,910 --> 00:38:38,160
[Relentless water shower in the face.]

688
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:44,090
I'm too scared of the water gun
to even play this game.

689
00:38:44,090 --> 00:38:46,340
- Don't answer too rashly.
- Quack-Quack.

690
00:38:47,810 --> 00:38:48,960
Orange.

691
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:55,390
[The water gun bringing
huge laughter to the group.]

692
00:39:00,970 --> 00:39:03,130
[The correct answer is, nectarine.]

693
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:06,900
Kwang-Gyu!

694
00:39:07,330 --> 00:39:08,550
Apple.

695
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:14,560
[Firing down upon him for the
wrong answer.]

696
00:39:18,250 --> 00:39:20,810
[Firing directly at the shiny Kyung Gyu.]

697
00:39:22,790 --> 00:39:24,530
- Wow, they're so cruel.
- Kwang-Gyu!

698
00:39:24,950 --> 00:39:25,900
[Back to the Kwang-Gyu team.]

699
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:27,440
- Apple!
- I just said that!

700
00:39:28,810 --> 00:39:30,300
I just said that!

701
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:34,060
Quack-Quack!
Grapes!

702
00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:37,970
Kwang-Gyu!
Mackerel!

703
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:40,170
Mackerel!

704
00:39:41,970 --> 00:39:43,850
Quack-Quack!
Melon!

705
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:48,450
[Not a melon...]

706
00:39:48,450 --> 00:39:51,000
Kwang-Gyu!
Orange!

707
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,650
They said that earlier!

708
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:55,720
- Kwang-Gyu!
- What else is there?

709
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,070
- It's a three letter word.
- Kwang-Gyu!

710
00:39:58,070 --> 00:39:59,250
Figs.

711
00:39:59,250 --> 00:40:01,150
- Fig.
- How would he have eaten a fig?

712
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:03,530
- Quack-Quack!
- Quack-Quack!

713
00:40:03,530 --> 00:40:06,220
- Let's discuss it first.
- I'm sure it was a rare food item.

714
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:08,950
- Guava.
- They already said that.

715
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:15,530
Kwang-Gyu!
Peach!

716
00:40:15,930 --> 00:40:17,920
- Peach!
- That's right.

717
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:19,840
It's peach.

718
00:40:19,850 --> 00:40:21,380
- Is it?
- Why didn't I think of that?

719
00:40:22,070 --> 00:40:23,870
[Correct answer]

720
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:30,800
[Team Kwang-Gyu answers
the first question correctly.]

721
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:33,510
- I didn't know that.
- A three letter fruit.

722
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:39,800
We would like to choose...
Lee Kwang Soo and John Park.

723
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:44,360
[Ha Ha and Sa Yuri vs.
Lee Kwang Soo and John Park.]

724
00:40:45,690 --> 00:40:46,880
We have to do this for real.

725
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:49,580
[Time to reveal the skills of the
Idiot Brothers.]

726
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:51,880
<i>This is a love question.</i>

727
00:40:52,230 --> 00:40:57,860
<i>In Europe, allowing women to
touch this...</i>

728
00:41:01,770 --> 00:41:05,250
<i>Allowing women to touch this...</i>

729
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:10,340
[What are you thinking about?]

730
00:41:10,770 --> 00:41:13,750
I'm sorry!

731
00:41:15,070 --> 00:41:16,960
- I'm sorry.
- In Europe...

732
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:21,950
<i>Allowing women to touch this
is an expression of love...</i>

733
00:41:23,130 --> 00:41:25,650
[It's all your fault.]

734
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:29,280
[This is all Kwang Soo's fault?]

735
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:33,960
[What are they all thinking about?]

736
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:36,820
- You need to get your head on straight!
- What is he thinking about?

737
00:41:38,210 --> 00:41:39,590
- Get your head on straight!
- Okay, I'm good.

738
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:42,680
What's the question again?

739
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:50,100
<i>That is the question. What are women allowed
to touch in Europe as an expression of love?</i>

740
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:52,230
Sa-Ha!
Nose!

741
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:55,920
Kwang-Park!
Armpit!

742
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:58,660
- Why would they touch the armpit?
- Sa-Ha!

743
00:41:59,170 --> 00:42:00,350
Hair strands?

744
00:42:03,410 --> 00:42:05,240
- Don't you even know the answer?
- Sa-Ha!

745
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:06,650
Nostril?

746
00:42:09,590 --> 00:42:11,390
Kwang-Park.
Bottom of the foot.

747
00:42:11,390 --> 00:42:13,310
Why are all the answers so dirty?

748
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:16,650
- Can you give us a hint?
- Here's your hint.

749
00:42:16,650 --> 00:42:18,490
I told you that it's related to
Greece, right?

750
00:42:18,490 --> 00:42:23,330
When you think of a Greek mythology,
what is the one symbol of masculinity?

751
00:42:23,330 --> 00:42:24,430
- Sa-Ha!
- Kwang-Park!

752
00:42:24,470 --> 00:42:27,470
- Kwang-Park was quicker.
- I was faster!

753
00:42:28,230 --> 00:42:29,510
Beard.

754
00:42:30,730 --> 00:42:32,910
[Correct answer]

755
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:38,940
- We got it.
- We're good.

756
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:40,730
Who's up next?

757
00:42:40,730 --> 00:42:44,370
[Kwang-Park couple on fire-
They beat Jong Kook and Ye Rim as well.]

758
00:42:44,370 --> 00:42:46,370
- Kang Gary and Song Ji Hyo!
- There you go.

759
00:42:46,370 --> 00:42:48,300
[They choose Kang Gary and Song Ji Hyo
as their next opponents.]

760
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:53,670
Give us a lot of love questions
since Kang Gary is so full of love.

761
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:56,800
[Because Gary is an expert in love?]

762
00:42:57,310 --> 00:43:01,270
With the meaning, 'Can't forget
whether asleep or awake'...

763
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:03,950
- Is it a four character idiom?
- Yes, it is.

764
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:10,560
What is the idiom that is often used to
describe the longing one feels for another?

765
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:12,790
- You have to think carefully about this.
- Monday.

766
00:43:12,790 --> 00:43:14,320
What is it?

767
00:43:14,770 --> 00:43:15,840
Blank-Gae!

768
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:17,180
Oh-Ri-Mu-Jong.

769
00:43:22,330 --> 00:43:25,410
Why? A man could be totally
intoxicated with a woman.

770
00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:30,230
- This is heard in sageuks a lot.
- Blank-Gae.

771
00:43:30,230 --> 00:43:31,700
Bul-Chul-Joo-Ya?

772
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:36,750
Think about sageuks and what they say.

773
00:43:36,750 --> 00:43:38,470
When they describe a young maiden.

774
00:43:39,370 --> 00:43:40,440
Blank-Gae!

775
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:42,650
Oh-mae-bul-bak.

776
00:43:43,210 --> 00:43:46,260
[Is he right?]

777
00:43:47,650 --> 00:43:50,480
No, no!
You have to listen to it again.

778
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:52,060
- What did you say?
- Say it again.

779
00:43:53,020 --> 00:43:55,340
- Say it one syllable at a time.
- It's already in the past.

780
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:58,140
- Say it again!
- Say your answer again.

781
00:43:58,140 --> 00:43:59,960
Oh-mae-bul-bang.

782
00:44:00,610 --> 00:44:02,960
[Bul-bang?]

783
00:44:05,740 --> 00:44:08,320
Kwang-Park!
Oh-mae-bul-mang!

784
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:11,610
[Correct answer]

785
00:44:15,790 --> 00:44:17,490
- Oh-mae-bul-bang?
- Ah... Oh-mae-bul-bang!

786
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:20,660
Oh my... bul-bang?
(bul-bang=Fiery room)

787
00:44:20,660 --> 00:44:22,260
So the room's on fire?

788
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:23,370
[Almost had it.]

789
00:44:23,370 --> 00:44:25,310
What is with you today, Kwang Soo?
You and John Park.

790
00:44:25,310 --> 00:44:28,890
- What's with the Idiot Brothers?
- We're not the Idiot Brothers.

791
00:44:29,330 --> 00:44:32,000
Our last couple,
the Jung-Jung couple!

792
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:35,020
- This is the final round.
- Final round.

793
00:44:35,020 --> 00:44:38,090
I'd feel bad if we win this whole thing
just for beating one team.

794
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:40,740
What does it matter?
You just need to worry about winning.

795
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:42,670
Just think of winning, Jung Chi.

796
00:44:42,670 --> 00:44:46,040
Then if they just win this round,
they win this whole game?

797
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:48,370
Kwang Gyu, is the sun bothering you?

798
00:44:48,370 --> 00:44:49,700
- What?
- Are you dizzy?

799
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:52,580
- I think I ate too much, because I'm sleepy.
- Really?

800
00:44:53,580 --> 00:44:55,490
I have food coma.

801
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:59,040
This is going to be a very
easy question.

802
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:00,430
I'm nervous.

803
00:45:00,690 --> 00:45:05,570
Because of all the camaraderie that they've
shared since they were little kids

804
00:45:05,890 --> 00:45:11,210
this person left many anecdotes that are still
remembered to this day. Who is this person?

805
00:45:11,450 --> 00:45:13,420
- I know this one.
- Jung Jung!

806
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:15,450
Oh Sung and Han Eum?

807
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:18,750
[Correct answer]

808
00:45:19,230 --> 00:45:22,230
[Gets the right answer in one shot!]

809
00:45:24,230 --> 00:45:26,070
This is the quiz diva!

810
00:45:26,070 --> 00:45:29,660
- This is the quiz diva.
- I can't believe she got it in one shot.

811
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:31,620
This is a survey question.

812
00:45:31,620 --> 00:45:33,980
[Next up is a survey question.]

813
00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:39,640
One hundred questions were asked to college
students in this recent TV program.

814
00:45:39,990 --> 00:45:44,020
What is the one song that they hate to
hear the most being sung at a karaoke bar?

815
00:45:44,020 --> 00:45:46,040
- I know this one.
- Kwang-Park.

816
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:47,650
You know the song, right?

817
00:45:47,650 --> 00:45:49,810
- It's a two letter word.
- She's gone?

818
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:54,720
[Have to listen to the whole question.]

819
00:46:01,050 --> 00:46:03,550
[Jung Chi getting a feeling from
the shot of water to his face?]

820
00:46:03,550 --> 00:46:05,650
Jung Chi looks so ugly when the water
is being sprayed at him.

821
00:46:08,850 --> 00:46:15,340
The number one song that the women hated
the most is, 'Confession' by Im Jae Bum.

822
00:46:15,340 --> 00:46:17,000
- Yes, that's it.
- It's 'Confession'.

823
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:21,310
What is the one song that male students
hated hearing the most by the female students?

824
00:46:21,310 --> 00:46:22,970
- I know this!
- Kwang-Park!

825
00:46:22,970 --> 00:46:25,600
'I like strawberries'
by Pippi long stocking?

826
00:46:29,670 --> 00:46:32,300
But... I actually agree with
him on that.

827
00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:35,270
I like strawberries!
Berries, berries!

828
00:46:35,270 --> 00:46:40,210
[Agreed that this song should
never be repeated.]

829
00:46:40,210 --> 00:46:42,340
Lee So Ra loves to sing that song.

830
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:45,000
- I hate hearing that song.
- 'Gee' by Girls Generation?

831
00:46:50,850 --> 00:46:52,950
- Don't you hate seeing that?
- Why would I hate seeing that?

832
00:46:53,530 --> 00:46:56,000
If that's the way they look,
then it really may be a hateful sight...]

833
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:01,640
Why are you such a good shot?

834
00:47:03,210 --> 00:47:04,460
Jung Jung.

835
00:47:04,460 --> 00:47:06,920
Sistar's 'Now that you're gone'?

836
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:10,490
- Sing it for us.
- It's all the songs that you like.

837
00:47:11,540 --> 00:47:13,470
What's wrong with him?
What's he doing?

838
00:47:13,470 --> 00:47:15,090
[Giving a physical demonstration.]

839
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:16,970
Why are you doing that to me?
Stop it.

840
00:47:17,620 --> 00:47:20,510
- She doesn't like to see it.
- I think it's a girl group song.

841
00:47:20,510 --> 00:47:22,320
Kwang-Park.
IU's 'It's a good day'.

842
00:47:24,220 --> 00:47:25,630
I bet that's it.

843
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:27,700
- Is that it?
- I bet that's it.

844

[Correct answer]

845
00:47:30,630 --> 00:47:32,220
We did it!

846
00:47:33,070 --> 00:47:36,170
[All the ladies, please refrain yourselves
from singing that song.]

847
00:47:36,170 --> 00:47:38,410
- This is the final question?
- Everything's riding on this.

848
00:47:38,410 --> 00:47:39,560
[The final question where
the victory is on the line.]

849
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:42,100
We'll show everyone how good we are.

850
00:47:43,420 --> 00:47:44,750
I will show everyone!

851
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:46,550
- Here's your question.
- The final question.

852
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:50,670
A novel based on friendship.

853
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:53,300
In the book,
'My lime orange tree'...

854
00:47:53,300 --> 00:47:55,320
I think I'm going to know this.

855
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:57,930
What is the name of the main character
in this book?

856
00:47:58,970 --> 00:48:00,700
Kwang-Park!
Thomas.

857
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:03,140
Jung Jung!
Jerome?

858
00:48:03,170 --> 00:48:04,370
Jerome?

859
00:48:07,390 --> 00:48:09,440
Jung Jung.
Jonas?

860
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:13,080
I thought I've heard of that name before.

861
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:16,210
- What is it?
- That's not the name, is it?

862
00:48:16,210 --> 00:48:18,550
It's a Brazilian name.

863
00:48:18,550 --> 00:48:20,540
It's Brazilian.

864
00:48:20,950 --> 00:48:22,270
Jung Jung.

865
00:48:22,270 --> 00:48:23,990
Jiko?

866
00:48:24,550 --> 00:48:27,980
[That's the name of
a Brazilian soccer player.]

867
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:29,090
He must really like soccer.

868
00:48:29,090 --> 00:48:31,790
- I really like soccer too.
- I don't know any other names.

869
00:48:32,190 --> 00:48:33,780
Kwang-Park!
ZeZe?

870
00:48:35,060 --> 00:48:36,100
ZeZe!

[Correct answer]

872
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:48,020
I got up to the first part
of the name.

[The Idiot Brothers beat them all...]

874
00:48:53,710 --> 00:48:55,510
The Idiot Brothers won?

875
00:48:55,510 --> 00:48:57,200
We're the smartest ones here!

876
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:58,980
You guys are all idiots!

[Jung Chi and Jung In win one gold bar
for coming in at second place.]

878
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:06,440
- This is for the first place winners.
- They get two? Wow...

879
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:08,480
- We have to decide who'll keep this?
- Yes, you must decide.

880
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:09,530
You have to think carefully about it.

881
00:49:09,530 --> 00:49:13,030
I'm sorry, but Ye Rim lost her gold.

882
00:49:13,090 --> 00:49:17,210
[Jong Kook and Ye Rim's gold bar
is missing?]

883
00:49:19,260 --> 00:49:21,250
She said she left it there earlier,
but now it's gone.

884
00:49:21,870 --> 00:49:23,630
You never know.
Someone could've taken it.

885
00:49:23,630 --> 00:49:26,080
[Did someone steal it?]

886
00:49:27,910 --> 00:49:30,910
[Paying more attention to the
safe keeping of their gold.]

887
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:33,940
- You didn't have any gold earlier.
- Yes, I did.

888
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:36,820
Decide who's going to keep it,
and off to the next location.

[And ten minutes later,
the sun starts to blaze again.]

892
00:49:51,310 --> 00:49:54,560
[Raining and not raining...
very strange weather.]

893
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:56,430
It is said that a tiger and a fox
get married on days like this.

894
00:49:56,430 --> 00:49:58,790
Then that would mean that I'm
the one getting married?

895
00:49:59,710 --> 00:50:01,320
What is this?

896
00:50:01,450 --> 00:50:03,310

<i>We looked everywhere for it,
and it's really gone.</i>

898

- If you lose it, then that's it.

899
00:50:07,570 --> 00:50:09,100
<i>It's really gone.
I told you earlier, didn't I?</i>

900
00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:10,970

take care of the gold for you.</i>

901
00:50:10,970 --> 00:50:14,480

somewhere, and no one saw it.</i>

00:50:21,340 --> 00:50:24,210
- When we were shooting the water gun earlier...
- That's where you lost it?

906
00:50:24,210 --> 00:50:26,070
- Where did you put it down?
- Right where I was sitting.

907

Who sat down in our seat after us?

908
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:29,110

[Then that would mean that
Haroro took the gold bar?]

911
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:40,220
That's not what I mean,
but I'm sure that he stole the bar.

912
00:50:40,220 --> 00:50:41,920
What do mean, I stole it?

913
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:44,360
We each had one before we even
started playing the game.

914
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:47,270
- No, you didn't.
- We won one at the last game.

915
00:50:47,270 --> 00:50:49,830
It could be a ploy by Ye Rim too.

916
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:51,960
Ye Rim could be playing us.

917
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:54,150
- Do we need to go back to the courtroom?
- Let's take this to court.

918
00:50:54,150 --> 00:50:57,170
- Which one of you took it?
- Since I'm a judge...

[Acting as the Judge from
'I Hear Your Voice'?]

Come on, seriously.

922
00:51:04,940 --> 00:51:07,690
- What's wrong with you?
- He played a judge in a recent drama.

923
00:51:07,690 --> 00:51:10,310
You need to be more cautious
with your own gold.

924
00:51:10,310 --> 00:51:12,600
Since this is already water under the bridge,
let's just forget about it.

925
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:14,980
- He's acting suspiciously.
- It's you. Give it back.

926

- How many bars do you have?
- It really isn't me.

927

But it's time to start the game.]

Peculiar mission?
That sounds like fun.

[This was a real mission that was played
in a world competition.]

<i>Do you see the boxes that
are behind you?</i>

935
00:51:36,590 --> 00:51:38,870

- Touch the stomach?

make your boats.</i>

940
00:51:56,040 --> 00:52:00,440
<i>The first team to arrive at the finish line
will be the winners of this mission.</i>

You have to get to the line in the boat?
Both of us?

942
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:05,370
- Both of you.
- He's going to sink our boat.

943
00:52:05,710 --> 00:52:07,480
- It's more than possible to do it.
- It's possible?

944
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:10,150
- A boat out of those cardboard boxes?
- This is what we make it out of?

945

946
00:52:11,450 --> 00:52:15,930

it'll be a cinch.</i>

that you see behind you.</i>

949
00:52:20,780 --> 00:52:22,830
<i>You don't necessarily need to
make it in that shape.</i>

[Make a rowboat by utilizing the
cardboard box, tape and saran wrap.]

951
00:52:26,140 --> 00:52:28,430
- Okay, let's get started.
- You've got 30 minutes.

952

[Time to make the cardboard boats!]

953
00:52:33,290 --> 00:52:35,060
It doesn't have to look like that boat.

954
00:52:35,060 --> 00:52:37,970
- No, it doesn't.
- It just has to get us to the finish line.

955
00:52:37,970 --> 00:52:39,200
That's right.

956

You're good at things like this.
Running Man has high standards.

960
00:52:52,850 --> 00:52:55,490
I noticed that Running Man tends to be
pretty scientific.

961
00:52:57,020 --> 00:52:59,600
- We have to do a good job with the cutting.
- The cutting?

962

[Jung Chi being meticulous with the cutting
by using the ruler and the blade.]

963

Even if we can't make it that well,
let's at least try to appear smart.

[A smart looking boat?]

965
00:53:09,770 --> 00:53:11,390

[Meanwhile, Jong Kook and Ye Rim's box
is already starting to look like a boat.]

967
00:53:17,850 --> 00:53:19,710
Yes, the boat bottoms are very taut.

968
00:53:19,710 --> 00:53:23,680
In that case, I think we need to angle it
instead of making it look too boxy.

969
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:27,610
[Mr. Capable moving right along
and building the boat as expected.]

970

Wow, look at that.

971
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:32,220
Awesome!

972
00:53:32,220 --> 00:53:34,040
- Isn't he good?
- What the heck?

973
00:53:34,040 --> 00:53:37,160
- Come on, Yuri.
- Let's trade teams.

974
00:53:37,350 --> 00:53:40,100
You go over there.
I want to ride on this boat with Jong Kook.

Why isn't this sticking?

980
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:05,600
[That's because you didn't
stick it on right.]

981
00:54:06,430 --> 00:54:08,290
We're going to have to wrap this around.

982

[The quiz winners who no longer
have anything left to say.]

983

We have to secure this somehow.

984
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:17,960
Should we just wing it?

985
00:54:19,290 --> 00:54:20,810

it on time?]

[What kind of a boat
will the Monday Couple come up with?]

988
00:54:31,170 --> 00:54:32,800
Should we build it like a raft?

00:54:34,250 --> 00:54:35,600
Like a raft?

990
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:38,680
- We can cut it up and make it thick.
- Really thick?

991
00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:41,380
That's not bad.
That's not a bad idea.

992
00:54:41,380 --> 00:54:43,870
We can build it like a raft.
So we agree, right?

993
00:54:43,870 --> 00:54:45,530
- Okay, let's do it.
- You can't change your mind, okay?

994
00:54:45,530 --> 00:54:47,650
[Monday Couple agrees to build
their boat like a raft.]

995
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:52,460
[Planning on twining the boards together
like they would with wood pillars.]

996
00:54:52,460 --> 00:54:55,010
- Let's put the bigger pieces on the bottom.
- That's right! My Ji Hyo is so smart!

997
00:54:55,010 --> 00:54:56,700
[Monday Couple working in sync.]

998
00:54:56,700 --> 00:54:58,760
If you break it apart like that,
it's going to leak.

999
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:00,330
- Why would it leak?
- You don't think it'll leak?

1000
00:55:00,330 --> 00:55:02,360
- No.
- We'll take care of it ourselves.

1001
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:04,500
- We know what we're doing.
- You're building it like a raft?

1002
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:05,540
No, we're not.

1003
00:55:05,540 --> 00:55:07,480
Don't you think raft is a pretty good idea?

1004
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:10,570
- What are you doing?
- Why are you copying our idea?

1005
00:55:10,890 --> 00:55:13,550
The most important thing is to make sure
that it's built really sturdy.

1006
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:18,120
Let's make it really strong.
We have to show them what we're made of.

1007
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:21,240
[Taping up the boat very securely first.]

1008
00:55:22,550 --> 00:55:25,430
How about we leave it like this for the back
and angle it a bit for the front?

1009
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:29,820
I don't think there's a single person here
who knows how to make this.

1010
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:32,270
Is this even going to float?

1011
00:55:32,270 --> 00:55:35,580
[Taping it over and over to make sure
that the boat is built strong.]

1012
00:55:35,580 --> 00:55:37,650
You think the two of you can ride
in this little thing?

1013
00:55:37,650 --> 00:55:40,200
Of course.
Why wouldn't we be able to?

1014
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:41,420
[It doesn't seem very feasible...]

1015
00:55:41,420 --> 00:55:43,800
- This is just our foundation.
- You have to cut a bit more here.

1016
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:45,660
[No way...]

1017
00:55:45,660 --> 00:55:48,220
We have to block this over here.
Let's tape it real well.

1018
00:55:48,220 --> 00:55:50,630
Want to tape up this whole thing
and cut a big hole over here?

1019
00:55:50,630 --> 00:55:51,790
Okay.

1020
00:55:51,830 --> 00:55:54,500
And we can add that box on
and have it shaped like a car.

1021
00:55:54,500 --> 00:55:55,890
- Okay! Deal!
- Deal!

1022
00:55:55,890 --> 00:55:57,700
- Okay, we got it.
- Were going to win this.

1023
00:55:57,700 --> 00:55:58,850
- We're going to win it.
- We're going to win it.

1024
00:55:59,670 --> 00:56:03,870
- We have to tape it really well.
- We're going to have to tape the whole thing.

1025
00:56:04,650 --> 00:56:07,580
[And the one team who doesn't even
have an idea of what to do yet.]

1026
00:56:08,080 --> 00:56:10,940
What is this supposed to be?
A refrigerator box?

1027
00:56:10,940 --> 00:56:12,790
Seriously.

1028
00:56:12,790 --> 00:56:14,840
First, we're going to have to
block this end off.

1029
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:16,550
[Kwang Gyu suggesting that they build
the frame of the boat first.]

1030
00:56:16,550 --> 00:56:19,460
[And Jae Suk suggesting that they make
sure the boat won't leak first.]

1031
00:56:20,590 --> 00:56:24,120
[No matter what is said, Jae Suk is too
afraid of the boat leaking and sinking.]

1032
00:56:24,430 --> 00:56:26,170
- That's just a waste.
- Just stick these two together first.

1033
00:56:26,170 --> 00:56:28,530
- That's just a waste.
- This is falling apart.

1034
00:56:28,530 --> 00:56:31,990
[The two men thinking in
two totally different directions.]

1035
00:56:35,720 --> 00:56:37,160
That really hurt!

1036
00:56:38,970 --> 00:56:41,120
Why are you so weak, Kyung Gyu?

1037
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:42,740
Here, I got it.

1038
00:56:43,870 --> 00:56:46,300
Let's pull this up, and tape it together.

1039
00:56:48,430 --> 00:56:52,290
[The two men with the least
bit of progress made.]

1040
00:56:53,050 --> 00:56:54,870
- From the way I see it..
- Yeah?

1041
00:56:54,870 --> 00:56:57,760
- I'm betting 100% that it's going to sink.
- No, it's not going to sink.

1042
00:56:57,770 --> 00:56:59,330
- It's going to sink.
- No, it's not.

1043
00:56:59,330 --> 00:57:00,580
[Will it?]

1044
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:03,630
[In 30 minutes.]

1045
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:08,480
[Will their boat float in water?]

1046
00:57:10,300 --> 00:57:14,190
[So meticulous!
Jung Chi is still measuring and cutting.]

1047
00:57:14,190 --> 00:57:15,630
Just wing it.

1048
00:57:19,690 --> 00:57:22,450
We're the only team using
a ruler right now.

1049
00:57:23,140 --> 00:57:26,110
Looking cool on the water is important.
The speed doesn't really matter.

1050
00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:30,160
[Jung Chi and Jung In with two
extremely different personalities.]

1051
00:57:30,660 --> 00:57:33,680
[They just need to fold it now.]

1052
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:35,910
I'll do it, I'll do it.
I think I can do it with my knees.

1053
00:57:35,910 --> 00:57:37,640
See?
It worked.

1054
00:57:40,360 --> 00:57:42,950
- But you made it crooked!
- That's no big deal.

1055
00:57:42,950 --> 00:57:44,670
We can't have this.

1056
00:57:45,340 --> 00:57:48,340
[Taking on the shape of a boat.]

1057
00:57:49,350 --> 00:57:52,900
We need to do it like them.
Theirs is starting to look like a boat.

1058
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:56,700
- Theirs is looking good.
- You have to be mindful of the design.

1059
00:57:56,700 --> 00:57:59,290
- That's pretty good.
- Don't look!

1060
00:57:59,290 --> 00:58:00,660
Okay, I won't.

1061
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:05,300
[Very protective about keeping the
secrecy of his own project.]

1062
00:58:05,300 --> 00:58:06,760
They're like corporate spies.

1063
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:08,660
What do you mean, corporate spies?

1064
00:58:09,790 --> 00:58:12,060
It must be nice for Jung In to
have Jung Chi.

1065
00:58:12,060 --> 00:58:14,860
- To have such a dependable boyfriend.
- You think?

1066
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:16,760
Right?

1067
00:58:17,450 --> 00:58:19,230
- Kwang Soo!
- Yes, Jae Suk?

1068
00:58:19,230 --> 00:58:21,570
- I guarantee that yours will sink.
- No, it won't.

1069
00:58:22,100 --> 00:58:24,250
Did you guys build a bookshelf?

1070
00:58:24,250 --> 00:58:25,810
- It's not a bookshelf.
- This is a bookshelf.

1071
00:58:25,810 --> 00:58:27,520
[At a close look, it does look like a
dining table/bookshelf?]

1072
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:29,490
- Then is it a dining table?
- No, it's not a dining table.

1073
00:58:29,490 --> 00:58:31,510
Is this where you eat your meals?

1074
00:58:31,930 --> 00:58:34,240
[What will this turn out to be?]

1075
00:58:37,690 --> 00:58:40,720
You're doing great!
Look at you go!

1076
00:58:40,730 --> 00:58:43,530
[Making the boxy boat sturdy by
wrapping the whole thing in tape.]

1077
00:58:43,530 --> 00:58:46,380
There you go.
You're doing great.

1078
00:58:46,390 --> 00:58:48,670
- Wrap it.
- Just wrap it?

1079
00:58:48,680 --> 00:58:50,090
Keep wrapping it.

1080
00:58:50,090 --> 00:58:51,860
Wrap it around like 50 times.

1081
00:58:52,820 --> 00:58:57,480
[Now wrapping it up. Not wanting
a single drop of water to get in.]

1082
00:58:57,480 --> 00:58:58,820
Let's just wrap the whole thing.

1083
00:58:58,820 --> 00:59:00,720
Keep wrapping it until the time is up.

1084
00:59:04,520 --> 00:59:07,400
[Their boat really is looking too small.]

1085
00:59:08,580 --> 00:59:11,400
You can ride in that one, and I'll
make another space for me to ride in

1086
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:13,020
and we can just connect
the two parts together.

1087
00:59:13,030 --> 00:59:15,100
- Don't you think? This could work.
- Okay.

1088
00:59:15,140 --> 00:59:18,750
[Sang Myun in the big box,
and Suk Jin in the little box.]

1089
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:23,960
[Time to begin building Suk Jin's box.]

1090
00:59:31,270 --> 00:59:33,170
- Should I try going in there?
- Get in there.

1091
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:43,660
I think we're good.

1092
00:59:43,660 --> 00:59:45,080
There you go.

1093
00:59:45,080 --> 00:59:48,640
[Gary and Ji Hyo are wrapping up all their
boxes together in a raft style.]

1094
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:50,180
Here it comes.

1095
00:59:50,180 --> 00:59:52,010
[Every move they make is in
perfect harmony.]

1096
00:59:52,010 --> 00:59:55,030
[Monday Couple- three years in the making.]

1097
00:59:55,030 --> 00:59:56,330
That's good.

1098
01:00:00,290 --> 01:00:01,640
- I'm so sorry.
- No, it's okay.

1099
01:00:03,380 --> 01:00:05,270
I think this is pretty good.
Let's try getting on it.

1100
01:00:05,270 --> 01:00:06,640
[First couple to complete their boat.]

1101
01:00:08,760 --> 01:00:10,960
- Doesn't it feel safe?
- It does feel safe.

1102
01:00:12,350 --> 01:00:14,300
- Be careful, Jung In.
- What?

1103
01:00:14,300 --> 01:00:15,790
- Be careful, okay?
- Okay.

1104
01:00:19,990 --> 01:00:21,280
That hurts.

1105
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:22,990
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

1106
01:00:27,340 --> 01:00:28,780
Be careful.

1107
01:00:28,780 --> 01:00:30,830
That knife scares me.

1108
01:00:32,560 --> 01:00:34,020
- You okay?
- What?

1109
01:00:34,020 --> 01:00:37,370
- Wear my gloves.
- No, it's okay.

1110
01:00:38,560 --> 01:00:40,780
- Is your head okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

1111
01:00:40,780 --> 01:00:43,700
You guys really care for each other.

1112
01:00:45,130 --> 01:00:46,320
Seriously.

1113
01:00:46,320 --> 01:00:49,510
We just need to coat this thing
now, okay?

1114
01:00:50,460 --> 01:00:51,900
Why aren't you answering me?
Okay?

1115
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:54,840
What do you mean, okay?
This thing looks like it's going to sink.

1116
01:00:54,850 --> 01:00:56,200
It's not going to sink.

1117
01:00:56,390 --> 01:00:58,930
[Seemingly happy with how it looks.]

1118
01:00:58,930 --> 01:01:02,100
- We need to tape the insides.
- We need to finish the outside first.

1119
01:01:02,100 --> 01:01:03,440
Okay, Honey?

1120
01:01:04,540 --> 01:01:08,420
[Back to the waterproofing vs.
securing the structure.]

1121
01:01:08,420 --> 01:01:10,040
Have you never built anything before?

1122
01:01:10,040 --> 01:01:14,120
We have to make sure
that it's balanced first.

1123
01:01:14,120 --> 01:01:16,030
- Come on, Mister!
- It won't be balanced otherwise.

1124
01:01:16,330 --> 01:01:18,780
[Not a fit, not a fit...]

1125
01:01:18,790 --> 01:01:21,990
- This isn't going to work.
- You and I are not a good fit.

1126
01:01:22,290 --> 01:01:25,840
- We can worry about the interior later.
- Hang on, we have to hurry.

1127
01:01:26,740 --> 01:01:29,130
Stop worrying about the
inside so much.

1128
01:01:29,130 --> 01:01:31,440
We can do that once we're in there.

1129
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:33,840
- Seriously, Mister!
- Just stop with the taping.

1130
01:01:35,640 --> 01:01:38,540
[Jae Suk is continuing with his
waterproofing efforts.]

1131
01:01:38,540 --> 01:01:41,980
- We have to do this part too.
- We have to make sure it's balanced first.

1132
01:01:41,980 --> 01:01:43,560
Why are you so obsessed with that?

1133
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:45,700
[Time to start wrapping.]

1134
01:01:45,700 --> 01:01:47,530
There you go.

1135
01:01:49,690 --> 01:01:52,130
- Ouch, that hurts.
- You come over this way.

1136
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:53,980
You go that way.

1137
01:01:53,980 --> 01:01:56,730
- Here, grab it.
- Are you talking to me in casual speech?

1138
01:01:58,170 --> 01:02:00,380
[Bickering about every little thing.]

1139
01:02:03,070 --> 01:02:06,160
[Jong Kook and Ye Rim complete
building their rowboat.]

1140
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:09,190
[Kwang Gyu coming over to take a look
at their boat.]

1141
01:02:09,190 --> 01:02:11,140
Yours looks very similar to ours.

1142
01:02:11,150 --> 01:02:14,240
Ours is a boxy looking shape,
and yours isn't that much different.

1143
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:16,690
It has to look like a boat.

1144
01:02:16,690 --> 01:02:20,150
- How did you do the bottom?
- Stop looking, Kyung Gyu.

1145
01:02:20,150 --> 01:02:21,870
Stop looking at our boat.

1146
01:02:24,680 --> 01:02:27,580
What are you doing?
Why are you trying to ruin our boat?

1147
01:02:27,580 --> 01:02:29,580
[Try to ruin other people's boats since
he's not happy with his own.]

1148
01:02:29,640 --> 01:02:31,100
- What's going on here?
- What?

1149
01:02:32,170 --> 01:02:34,360
- They made it very sturdy.
- Isn't it great?

1150
01:02:36,650 --> 01:02:39,840

No, it's going to flip over.

You just stay down there.
I'll finish up the boat.

[Will Jung Chi and Jung In's boat
float on water?]

1185

making it look like a boat, didn't they?

01:12:33,310 --> 01:12:35,840
Wow... Ha Ha's pretty fast.

1314
01:12:35,840 --> 01:12:37,310
They're going to beat them.

1315
01:12:37,980 --> 01:12:40,590
[Which team will get the better record?]

1316
01:12:43,560 --> 01:12:46,650
[Ha Ha crosses the finish line
with this experienced rowing skills.]

1317
01:12:47,650 --> 01:12:51,430
[By the split of a hair,
Jong Kook and Ye Rim also crosses the line!]

1318
01:12:51,430 --> 01:12:53,890
- Aren't we awesome?
- We're awesome!

1319
01:12:53,890 --> 01:12:55,110
- Yes!
- Yes!

1320
01:12:56,250 --> 01:13:00,030
[Kkuk on the other hand is disappointed
with their record.]

1321
01:13:00,030 --> 01:13:02,960
It's not the boat that went,
but Jong Kook who made the boat go.

1322
01:13:04,780 --> 01:13:07,670
[Highly anticipated contestants number five-
Jae Suk and Kwang Gyu.]

1323
01:13:07,680 --> 01:13:09,870
Which apartment are you guys
moving into?

1324
01:13:09,870 --> 01:13:15,470
[Refrigerator box/Coffin boat-
Contestants number 5- Jae Suk and Kwang Gyu.]

1325
01:13:15,470 --> 01:13:18,110
I guarantee 100% that
their boat is going to capsize.

1326
01:13:18,120 --> 01:13:19,910
It really looks awful.

1327
01:13:19,910 --> 01:13:21,900
I bet they won't make it past 10m.

1328
01:13:21,900 --> 01:13:23,810
Are you ready?

1329
01:13:24,130 --> 01:13:26,430
You look really scared, Kwang Gyu.

1330
01:13:26,430 --> 01:13:28,610
I feel like you guys are going to
capsize the moment you get going.

1331
01:13:28,610 --> 01:13:30,310
[Looks like their boat is going to capsize
the moment the helpers let go.]

1332
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:34,160
- Okay, we're good.
- They're not going to make it.

1333
01:13:45,670 --> 01:13:48,410
- Why kind of an oar did you give us?
- Our oar just broke!

1334
01:13:49,680 --> 01:13:51,770
[It's a sight to behold.]

1335
01:13:51,780 --> 01:13:54,080
The way I see it, I guarantee
that we won't be in last place.

1336
01:13:55,990 --> 01:13:57,930
They can't even get balanced.

1337
01:13:58,470 --> 01:14:00,600
[Making another attempt at it after
having switched out their oars.]

1338
01:14:02,090 --> 01:14:03,500
They're going to sink.

1339
01:14:08,020 --> 01:14:10,840
- Everyone, keep your eyes on their boat!
- This really is going to be our coffin.

1340
01:14:12,430 --> 01:14:14,330
They're never going to make it.

1341
01:14:14,330 --> 01:14:16,120
Let's see how well they do.

1342
01:14:17,510 --> 01:14:20,140
[Are they even going to be
able to get on their way?]

1343
01:14:22,550 --> 01:14:24,300
- You're leaning to the left.
- Start!

1344
01:14:24,300 --> 01:14:25,910
[Start!]

1345
01:14:25,910 --> 01:14:29,210
One, two!
One, two!

1346
01:14:31,430 --> 01:14:32,740
What the heck?

1347
01:14:35,440 --> 01:14:37,780
[It's quite fast!]

1348
01:14:41,780 --> 01:14:44,450
One, two!
One, two!

1349
01:14:45,130 --> 01:14:47,810
[Totally unexpected.]

1350
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:50,980
How can this be?

1351
01:14:54,980 --> 01:14:57,590
[Rowing as if their lives depended on it.]

1352
01:14:57,590 --> 01:14:59,960
[Even funnier because they're moving fast
when they've already been discounted.]

1353
01:14:59,960 --> 01:15:03,040
[If we stop... we'll sink!]

1354
01:15:05,980 --> 01:15:07,730
What is this?

1355
01:15:09,100 --> 01:15:13,020
[Determined not to fall in,
they speed along to the finish line!]

1356
01:15:14,280 --> 01:15:18,360
[Jae Suk and Kwang Gyu
crosses the finish line!]

1357
01:15:19,970 --> 01:15:21,650
[What are they doing at the finish line?]

1358
01:15:21,650 --> 01:15:24,780
[The refrigerator box capsizes
the moment it completes its duty.]

1359
01:15:27,980 --> 01:15:30,400
[But they still did it!]

1360
01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:32,760
- Good job!
- Good job!

1361
01:15:32,770 --> 01:15:36,350
It's a boat that capsizes if you stop,
and will stay upright if you keep going.

1362
01:15:39,570 --> 01:15:40,780
That was good.

1363
01:15:40,780 --> 01:15:42,960
- Why did you kiss me?
- That was good.

1364
01:15:44,940 --> 01:15:46,920
- Even though everyone mocked us...
- I know!

1365
01:15:46,920 --> 01:15:49,750
- But we did it!
- They called it our coffin!

1366
01:15:49,750 --> 01:15:51,660
What are you doing, Father!

1367
01:15:53,150 --> 01:15:56,660
[What was their record?
You'll soon find out!]

1368
01:15:57,690 --> 01:16:02,120
[Monday Couple still practicing
their rowing skills.]

1369
01:16:02,120 --> 01:16:05,290
One, two!
Pull it through to the end! There you go.

1370
01:16:06,340 --> 01:16:07,360
We got it!

1371
01:16:07,360 --> 01:16:11,280
[This is why they say that you should never
learn how to drive from your boyfriend.]

1372
01:16:11,690 --> 01:16:19,900
[Monday Raft-
Contestants number 6- Gary and Ji Hyo.]

1373
01:16:19,900 --> 01:16:21,720
Nice long strokes, okay?

1374
01:16:21,720 --> 01:16:25,070
- Nice long strokes, okay? Fighting!
- I said, okay!

1375
01:16:25,070 --> 01:16:26,950
Stop nagging!

1376
01:16:26,960 --> 01:16:34,310
[Kwang-Park Boat:
Contestants number 7- Kwang Soo, John Park.]

1377
01:16:34,900 --> 01:16:36,340
Set, go!

1378
01:16:36,340 --> 01:16:37,950
[Go!]

1379
01:16:38,920 --> 01:16:42,980
[Both teams start off at a good speed!]

1380
01:16:42,980 --> 01:16:45,140
One, two!
One, two!

1381
01:16:46,460 --> 01:16:48,210
No!
Slow down, Kwang Soo!

1382
01:16:49,710 --> 01:16:53,830
[Monday Couple in perfect sync
from all their practicing.]

1383
01:16:54,460 --> 01:16:56,120
They're fast.

1384
01:16:57,900 --> 01:16:59,510
Look at me and follow my lead.

1385
01:17:01,070 --> 01:17:05,800
[But... where are Kwang Soo
and John Park?]

1386
01:17:08,020 --> 01:17:10,880
[Gary and Ji Hyo moving right along.]

1387
01:17:10,880 --> 01:17:12,970
Gary's rowing is slower than Ji Hyo's.

1388
01:17:16,410 --> 01:17:18,450
Strong pull!
More! More!

1389
01:17:20,560 --> 01:17:23,250
[Gary and Ji Hyo cross
the finish line at top speed!]

1390
01:17:23,260 --> 01:17:25,060
You're such a nagger!

1391
01:17:26,650 --> 01:17:29,700
One, two!
One, two!

1392
01:17:29,700 --> 01:17:32,830
[This is what they've been doing...]

1393
01:17:38,170 --> 01:17:40,880
[They keep turning towards the sides
because of their inability to get in sync.]

1394
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:43,700
[Kwang Soo's the only one rowing
at top speed.]

1395
01:17:44,540 --> 01:17:45,940
Stop rowing.
Just stop.

1396
01:17:46,890 --> 01:17:48,940
[Now they're going backwards?]

1397
01:17:49,540 --> 01:17:51,900
[Nice skills.]

1398
01:17:53,300 --> 01:17:55,420
You guys are going backwards!

1399
01:17:57,160 --> 01:18:00,890
[They finally start going
in the right direction.]

1400
01:18:00,900 --> 01:18:04,010
[Going at top speed-
And going at a leisurely speed.]

1401
01:18:04,010 --> 01:18:05,480
This is so annoying!

1402
01:18:06,210 --> 01:18:07,840
I'm so annoyed!

1403
01:18:12,560 --> 01:18:15,200
What are you doing?
And what did you just say to me?

1404
01:18:17,430 --> 01:18:20,190
[Getting back on their way after
getting back in sync with one another.]

1405
01:18:20,460 --> 01:18:24,280
[How can they be so much like
their namesake?]

1406
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:28,650
[Kwang Soo's rowing direction is...]

1407
01:18:28,650 --> 01:18:31,630
- Why aren't you rowing?
- You're rowing way too fast.

1408
01:18:31,630 --> 01:18:33,360
- Don't give up!
- You're rowing too fast.

1409
01:18:33,370 --> 01:18:36,250
One, two!
One, two!

1410
01:18:36,250 --> 01:18:38,590
They should just go backwards.

1411
01:18:38,590 --> 01:18:40,100
You guys are going backwards again.

1412
01:18:40,110 --> 01:18:42,950
One, two!
One, two!

1413
01:18:42,950 --> 01:18:45,730
[The boat finally starting to move forward
with Kwang Soo losing his stamina.]

1414
01:18:46,210 --> 01:18:49,920
[Really took a lot of effort to get here.]

1415
01:18:52,230 --> 01:18:55,230
[Kwang Soo and John Park
finally crosses the finish line.]

1416
01:18:56,070 --> 01:18:59,290
[Even though it wasn't a slow boat,
their rowing was... what was their record?]

1417
01:19:01,960 --> 01:19:05,480
[Time to reveal the record
for all seven couples!]

1418
01:19:05,480 --> 01:19:06,560
I hope we made it in the top three!

1419
01:19:06,560 --> 01:19:07,940
I really want to win a gold bar!

1420
01:19:08,500 --> 01:19:11,460
Kim Jong Kook and Ye Rim's
record was 2 minutes and 5 seconds.

1421
01:19:11,460 --> 01:19:13,300
- What did you say?
- Did they come in at seventh place?

1422
01:19:13,300 --> 01:19:14,890
What about this team?

1423
01:19:15,300 --> 01:19:19,450
Lee Kwang Soo and John Park's
record was 1 minutes and 58 seconds.

1424
01:19:19,450 --> 01:19:21,370
[Lee Kwang Soo and John Park-
1 minute and 58 seconds!]

1425
01:19:21,370 --> 01:19:23,880
- Kwang!
- We didn't come in at last place!

1426
01:19:23,880 --> 01:19:25,540
- Kwang!
- Cross!

1427
01:19:25,540 --> 01:19:27,250
You have to say 'Park' first,
you dummy!

1428
01:19:29,240 --> 01:19:31,100
In fifth place is...

1429
01:19:32,260 --> 01:19:35,820
Ha Ha and Sa Yuri with
one minute and 36 seconds.

1430
01:19:37,380 --> 01:19:40,630
In fourth place is,
Ji Suk Jin and Park Sang Myun.

1431
01:19:40,640 --> 01:19:43,230
They came in at one minute 35 seconds.

1432
01:19:43,230 --> 01:19:45,740
- This is nerve wrecking!
- Im so nervous!

1433
01:19:45,740 --> 01:19:47,910
Now there are only three teams left.

1434
01:19:48,310 --> 01:19:52,030
[Who placed first of these three teams?]

1435
01:19:52,030 --> 01:19:53,560
Jung Chi and Jung In's team...

1436
01:19:53,560 --> 01:19:55,190
Their record is...

1437
01:19:55,610 --> 01:19:57,430
50.65 seconds.

1438
01:19:57,430 --> 01:20:00,530
[Jung Chi and Jung In with
a record of 50.56 seconds.]

1439
01:20:00,530 --> 01:20:02,570
Team Gary and Ji Hyo...

1440
01:20:03,290 --> 01:20:04,950
with a record of 50...

1441
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:10,540
50...

1442
01:20:12,410 --> 01:20:14,060
50.76 seconds.

1443
01:20:14,060 --> 01:20:18,960
[Gary and Ji Hyo with a record of
50.76 seconds.]

1444
01:20:18,970 --> 01:20:21,520
Team Yoo Jae Suk and Kim Kwang Gyu.

1445
01:20:30,960 --> 01:20:33,020
42.25 seconds.

1446
01:20:33,020 --> 01:20:34,950
[Jae Suk and Kwang Gyu break
the record with 42.25 seconds!]

1447
01:20:34,950 --> 01:20:39,550
[Jae Suk and Kwang Gyu win with
42.25 seconds!]

1448
01:20:40,470 --> 01:20:44,570
[The winners of the first ever
cardboard boat race- Jae Suk and Kwang Gyu!]

1449
01:20:45,260 --> 01:20:47,650
[Second place- Jung Chi and Jung In.
Third place- Gary and Ji Hyo.]

1450
01:20:47,650 --> 01:20:51,470
Any other time, I'd clap for
the first place winners

1451
01:20:51,480 --> 01:20:54,810
but it's just absurd that they came in
at first place with a boat like that.

1452
01:20:56,560 --> 01:20:59,310
They won first place
in their refrigerator box!

1453
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:04,390
[The will to survive is definitely
more crucial than the tool itself.]

1454
01:21:13,970 --> 01:21:17,210
[All the couples having arrived
at the final camping location.]

1455
01:21:17,610 --> 01:21:23,110
[They still haven't found
Ye Rim's missing gold bar.]

1456
01:21:23,110 --> 01:21:24,510
Who took our gold!

1457
01:21:25,290 --> 01:21:27,350
- Since I'm the judge...
- What is it was Kwang Gyu?

1458
01:21:29,010 --> 01:21:30,570
Whomever took our gold is a thief!

1459
01:21:30,580 --> 01:21:32,180
There's no respect in that situation!

1460
01:21:33,310 --> 01:21:35,950
- Am I right or am I right?
- You are being so rash!

1461
01:21:35,950 --> 01:21:39,200
- It's not me.
- We don't know who took it right now.

1462
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:46,050
[Why does Jung In have four gold bars?]

1463
01:21:46,050 --> 01:21:48,490
Hang on a second.
Why do you have four gold bars?

1464
01:21:49,530 --> 01:21:51,470
Why do you have four gold bars?
Hang on a second here.

1465
01:21:51,470 --> 01:21:54,540
[Jung Chi and Jung In should only
have three gold bars?]

1466
01:21:54,540 --> 01:21:56,770
I was told to steal other people's gold
when we started the race earlier.

1467
01:21:57,430 --> 01:21:59,560
[Don't you remember?]

1468
01:21:59,990 --> 01:22:03,680
<i>You all have to take care of your own
gold bars throughout the day.</i>

1469
01:22:03,680 --> 01:22:08,090
<i>If you lose it, or have it stolen from you,
we can't be responsible for that.</i>

1470
01:22:08,100 --> 01:22:12,180
[Then it means... that we can steal it?]

1471
01:22:12,920 --> 01:22:16,130
[So she actually stole it!]

1472
01:22:17,460 --> 01:22:20,380
- She's a bad person!
- I can't believe you did that!

1473
01:22:20,380 --> 01:22:23,640
- She's a thief.
- I didn't take you to be like that.

1474
01:22:24,080 --> 01:22:25,600
The thing that scared me the most...

1475
01:22:25,600 --> 01:22:29,160
was when she threw away Ye Rim's
bag in the bathroom garbage can.

1476
01:22:29,840 --> 01:22:32,580
[Admitting to the truth?]

1477
01:22:32,580 --> 01:22:34,900
I was too scared to even say anything.

1478
01:22:34,900 --> 01:22:37,560
You stole our gold,
and threw away the bag in the trash?

1479
01:22:37,560 --> 01:22:39,400
You just took the gold out of there?

1480
01:22:39,400 --> 01:22:41,750
- She's one scary person.
- I didn't do anything illegal.

1481
01:22:41,750 --> 01:22:45,060
- What I did wasn't illegal.
- He did tell us that in the beginning.

1482
01:22:45,060 --> 01:22:47,260
[Can't say anything since it was stated
in the rules at the beginning of the race.]

1483
01:22:47,810 --> 01:22:51,050
- She's my teammate, but she scared me
- So I can just take it back then?

1484
01:22:51,310 --> 01:22:54,240
[Mr. Capable starting to get angry!]

1485
01:22:54,240 --> 01:22:55,340
Then I can just take it back?

1486
01:22:55,340 --> 01:22:57,090
- I can just take it from others?
- Counsel!

1487
01:23:00,280 --> 01:23:05,240
[It's too late to take it now... Only the gold
they already have will be counted.]

1488
01:23:05,240 --> 01:23:08,420
In that case,
these two teams are tied in first place.

1489
01:23:08,420 --> 01:23:12,510
[Jung Chi, Jung In and Gary, Ji Hyo
both win for having four gold bars!]

1490
01:23:12,510 --> 01:23:14,440
[A special mission for these two teams?]

1491
01:23:14,440 --> 01:23:16,470
What is it that you want us to do
with these scheme artists?

1492
01:23:16,560 --> 01:23:19,770
The teams who did not come in at first place
must give back their gold bars.

1493
01:23:19,770 --> 01:23:23,230
[All the other teams who didn't come in at
first place must give back their gold bars.]

1494
01:23:23,570 --> 01:23:25,290
[Say... what?]

1495
01:23:25,290 --> 01:23:29,280
- What kind of a filthy rule is that!
- What are you doing!

1496
01:23:30,450 --> 01:23:33,870
[You had to win to keep the gold...]

1497
01:23:36,230 --> 01:23:39,540
Listen to how my hoarse my voice sounds
from trying to protect it all day.

1498
01:23:42,270 --> 01:23:44,190
The race is now all over.

1499
01:23:44,200 --> 01:23:46,630
The couples with the most number of
gold bars at the moment are

1500
01:23:46,630 --> 01:23:50,850
the Monday Couple,
and Couple Jung Chi and Jung In.

1501
01:23:51,100 --> 01:23:55,380
Each team must now decide
whether they want to take the gold...

1502
01:23:55,380 --> 01:23:58,470
or stay with their partner.
You must choose between the two.

1503
01:23:58,470 --> 01:24:01,060
[Both teams must now decide whether
they want to keep the gold or their partner.]

1504
01:24:01,060 --> 01:24:05,490
[The ultimate decision.
Will it be the gold, or your partner?]

1505
01:24:06,450 --> 01:24:10,720
<i>You will each be given a minute to think
about your decision in your own tent.</i>

1506
01:24:11,220 --> 01:24:13,690
<i>In the case where both members of
a team chooses their partner</i>

1507
01:24:13,690 --> 01:24:16,900
<i>they may not be able to keep all the gold
that they've won thus far</i>

1508
01:24:16,900 --> 01:24:20,260
<i>but they will be able to verify and maintain
their true love that they have for each other.</i>

1509
01:24:20,620 --> 01:24:24,350
<i>And in the case where one chooses the gold,
and the other chooses their partner...</i>

1510
01:24:24,680 --> 01:24:29,930
<i>the person who chose the gold on that team
will take all the gold for themselves.</i>

1511
01:24:30,310 --> 01:24:33,990
<i>In the case where both members choose
their greed for the gold...</i>

1512
01:24:34,670 --> 01:24:37,880
<i>they will have to turn in all the gold
that they've won thus far.</i>

1513
01:24:37,880 --> 01:24:39,580
[If they both choose the gold,
all the gold must be given back.]

1514
01:24:40,620 --> 01:24:46,480
[Will it be the gold, or their partner?]

1515
01:24:52,620 --> 01:24:55,490
[These two couples...
what is their heart's desire?]

1516
01:24:55,490 --> 01:24:57,310
Their misfortune is our happiness.

1517
01:24:57,310 --> 01:24:59,240
[Non-winners unhappy about having
become the bridesmaids.]

1518
01:24:59,240 --> 01:25:01,250
How about we get the gold
if they don't win it?

1519
01:25:01,250 --> 01:25:06,450
[Jong Kook suggests that they get the gold
if the winning couples loses theirs?]

1520
01:25:06,450 --> 01:25:09,010
- Don't you think so?
- We can all split it.

1521
01:25:09,010 --> 01:25:10,910
<i>If that happens,
like Kim Jong Kook suggested...</i>

1522
01:25:11,700 --> 01:25:16,070
<i>In the case where they both choose gold,
and they have to turn their gold back in...</i>

1523
01:25:16,070 --> 01:25:18,350
<i>then I will divide up the gold
amongst all of you.</i>

1524
01:25:18,350 --> 01:25:20,620
[Even if one couple loses their gold,
it means gold for the loser teams!]

1525
01:25:20,620 --> 01:25:23,700
- We need this once in a while.
- Gold! Gold!

1526
01:25:24,980 --> 01:25:27,880
<i>We will first go with the Monday Couple.</i>

1527
01:25:27,880 --> 01:25:31,930
[Time to check where the Monday Couple's
hearts stands.]

1528
01:25:31,940 --> 01:25:35,820
[That woman, and that man...
Will be it the gold, or each other?]

1529
01:25:35,820 --> 01:25:37,780
I assure you that they both
chose the gold.

1530
01:25:40,230 --> 01:25:45,240
Gold!

1531
01:25:45,830 --> 01:25:50,820
[Just... what did their hearts choose?]

1532
01:25:51,250 --> 01:25:54,190
I want you, Kang Gary!

1533
01:25:54,190 --> 01:25:57,360
[Three years of going back and forth
in their love affair...]

1534
01:25:57,360 --> 01:26:02,470
[The man and the woman having relied on
each other like a lover and a friend.]

1535
01:26:02,470 --> 01:26:06,260
[Just what is inside their hearts right now?]

1536
01:26:08,190 --> 01:26:09,710
He's going to choose gold.

1537
01:26:10,420 --> 01:26:13,100
[Gary chooses Ji Hyo!]

1538
01:26:13,880 --> 01:26:16,070
- What the heck?
- You should've chosen gold.

1539
01:26:16,070 --> 01:26:18,720
It's been awhile since we've been
coupled up like this.

1540
01:26:18,720 --> 01:26:20,420
You should've been honest
with yourself.

1541
01:26:20,420 --> 01:26:25,160
I know that she wrote down gold,
and we can just split the stash later.

1542
01:26:25,160 --> 01:26:27,270
[Having prepared himself for a situation
where Ji Hyo would've chosen the gold?]

1543
01:26:27,270 --> 01:26:29,970
- That's true.
- You guys don't know what it's like.

1544
01:26:29,970 --> 01:26:33,130
You have no idea how hard we worked
together today building that boat.

1545
01:26:33,130 --> 01:26:36,890
It felt like we went back to the way
we used to be two years ago.

1546
01:26:37,560 --> 01:26:39,690
You guys don't know what
that feels like.

1547
01:26:39,870 --> 01:26:44,080
- Kiss her! Kiss her!
- What do you mean, kiss?

1548
01:26:44,080 --> 01:26:48,110
You were asking me about
French kissing in the car earlier too.

1549
01:26:48,560 --> 01:26:49,720
Ji Hyo's answer?

1550
01:26:49,950 --> 01:26:53,250
[Gary chose his partner...
What did Ji Hyo's heart tell her?]

1551
01:26:53,250 --> 01:26:54,870
I...

1552
01:26:56,690 --> 01:26:58,420
Are they saying that they're going to
start dating for real now?

1553
01:26:58,680 --> 01:27:01,020
- I can't even stand this.
- Gold?

1554
01:27:04,600 --> 01:27:05,630
No, it's her partner.

1555
01:27:06,050 --> 01:27:07,910
Kang Gary?

1556
01:27:07,910 --> 01:27:10,170
- What is this?
- What are you guys doing?

1557
01:27:11,930 --> 01:27:14,080
You're just playing with me,
aren't you?

1558
01:27:14,080 --> 01:27:16,310
Show us what your answer is!
What are you doing?

1559
01:27:16,430 --> 01:27:20,530
[In her heart is...]

1560
01:27:22,100 --> 01:27:27,020
[But still...
Monday Couple is the best!]

1561
01:27:27,020 --> 01:27:28,850
[My partner, Kang Gary.]

1562
01:27:28,850 --> 01:27:31,740
[Ji Hyo also chooses her partner!]

1563
01:27:31,740 --> 01:27:35,640
[Monday Couple treasures each other
more than the gold!]

1564
01:27:42,260 --> 01:27:43,860
Why did you do that?

1565
01:27:43,860 --> 01:27:46,670
- You should've chosen the gold!
- I thought you were going to choose the gold!

1566
01:27:46,680 --> 01:27:48,770
We should've split it!
What were you thinking!

1567
01:27:48,770 --> 01:27:50,910
I thought you were going to
pick the gold!

1568
01:27:50,910 --> 01:27:53,500
- You two are beautiful together.
- Let's do it over.

1569
01:27:53,500 --> 01:27:56,110
[At least one of you had to have chosen
the gold to have won anything...]

1570
01:27:57,630 --> 01:28:01,620
[The loser teams are too happy at the
winning couple losing their gold.]

1571
01:28:01,620 --> 01:28:06,050
Gold!

1572
01:28:06,050 --> 01:28:09,010
But it still makes me happy to know
where your heart stands.

1573
01:28:11,870 --> 01:28:14,780
Gary, you won something much more
precious than gold.

1574
01:28:14,780 --> 01:28:17,230
[Time to find out what Jung Chi
and Jung In chose.]

1575
01:28:17,720 --> 01:28:20,580
I'm positive that they chose gold.
Guarantee that they chose gold.

1576
01:28:20,580 --> 01:28:22,780
I bet it'll start off with
one of them choosing the gold.

1577
01:28:23,910 --> 01:28:25,180
We have to start off with the gold.

1578
01:28:26,120 --> 01:28:27,530
I'll start.

1579
01:28:27,530 --> 01:28:31,620
[Real life couple, Jung Chi and Jung In.
Will it be the gold or their love?]

1580
01:28:32,830 --> 01:28:39,570
[Their love for each other that's
been growing all these years...]

1581
01:28:39,570 --> 01:28:44,410
[Even through all of their bickering,
their hearts are full of their love.]

1582
01:28:46,320 --> 01:28:49,030
[That man's selection is...]

1583
01:28:49,030 --> 01:28:51,120
[Gold]

1584
01:28:51,120 --> 01:28:53,940
[Jung Chi chooses gold!]

1585
01:28:53,940 --> 01:28:58,380
Jo Jung Chi!
Jo Jung Chi!

1586
01:29:00,110 --> 01:29:03,250
The thought of gold made me so happy
so I even drew a picture of it.

1587
01:29:03,630 --> 01:29:07,210
Gold!

1588
01:29:07,910 --> 01:29:10,960
[If Jung In also chose the gold,
it'll be time to celebrate!]

1589
01:29:11,440 --> 01:29:13,090
Get ready to celebrate!

1590
01:29:13,090 --> 01:29:14,760
[Then her selection is...]

1591
01:29:14,760 --> 01:29:18,900
[Will it be gold, or love?]

1592
01:29:32,600 --> 01:29:33,980
[Partner]

1593
01:29:33,980 --> 01:29:36,000
[Jung In chooses her partner!]

1594
01:29:41,430 --> 01:29:42,770
In that case...

1595
01:29:43,310 --> 01:29:46,010
Jung Chi and Jung In can keep
all the gold that they've earned today.

1596
01:29:46,010 --> 01:29:48,540
[Jung Chi and Jung In get to
keep all four of their gold bars!]

1597
01:29:48,540 --> 01:29:51,210
There was one more rule that
has been set from the beginning.

1598
01:29:51,210 --> 01:29:53,440
[Rule that's been set from the beginning?]

1599
01:29:54,240 --> 01:29:57,220
<i>The best selection that could've been
made in this couple race today...</i>

1600
01:29:57,220 --> 01:29:59,730
<i>was for both partners to
choose each other.</i>

1601
01:29:59,730 --> 01:30:02,440
- That was our rule from the beginning.
- Is there a golden turtle or something?

1602
01:30:02,440 --> 01:30:08,270
<i>You will each receive twice the amount of
gold that you've earned today.</i>

1603
01:30:08,270 --> 01:30:12,210
[Monday Couple will each receive twice the
amount of gold that they've earned today.]

1604
01:30:12,210 --> 01:30:16,670
[The ultimate winners are-
Monday Couple for having chosen each other.]

1605
01:30:16,670 --> 01:30:19,580
[Today was a love race, after all.]

1606
01:30:19,580 --> 01:30:22,270
<i>So Gary gets two bars since he had
possession of one bar.</i>

1607
01:30:23,600 --> 01:30:27,370
<i>And since Ji Hyo had three in her possession,
she wins a total of six bars.</i>

1608
01:30:27,370 --> 01:30:28,730
You knew it all along, didn't you?
You greedy person!

1609
01:30:28,730 --> 01:30:30,700
[Starting their bickering all over again.]

1610
01:30:30,700 --> 01:30:31,790
Half of that is mine!

1611
01:30:31,790 --> 01:30:34,210
Ji Hyo always gets so lucky with her gold.

1612
01:30:34,210 --> 01:30:36,570
This is putting Jung Chi and Jung In
in a very weird position.

1613
01:30:36,570 --> 01:30:38,010
[Putting Jung Chi and Jung In
in an awkward position.]

1614
01:30:38,020 --> 01:30:40,720
Congratulations for being the only one
to have chosen gold over your partner.

1615
01:30:44,040 --> 01:30:46,010
- That's our Monday Couple.
- Monday Couple.

1616
01:30:46,790 --> 01:30:50,080
Kiss her!

1617
01:30:50,090 --> 01:30:52,230
- Stop telling them to kiss!
- If that's what you want, I'll do it.

1618
01:30:55,360 --> 01:30:59,400
[Having a partner...
is more precious than real gold.]
