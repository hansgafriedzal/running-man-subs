Is this where I get off?

36
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:39,170

<i>Welcome, Running Man members.</i>

43
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,500

<i>The Icy Order Race.</i>

00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:29,140
Icy order...

50
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:32,260
The order does need to be redefined.

00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:34,160
<i>During the course of today...</i>

52
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:40,840

their uniforms immediately.</i>

54
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:51,140
[Pre-assigned uniforms.]

55
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:52,440
I'm in second place.

56
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:55,460
Why am I in second place?

57
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:58,650
What? Sixth place?
That's just ridiculous.

58
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:02,830
I get it, is it according to looks?
That's just ridiculous.

59
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:04,720
I'm going to work my way up.

60
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:07,080
Mark my words,
I'm going to work my way up!

61
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:09,440
[Already behaving like a resident
of the corner space in the ice building.]

62
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:12,790
I want some steak too!

63
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,660
<i>Change into your clothes.</i>

64
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:23,030
Okay.

65
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:26,190
[Thus, without even knowing the reason...]

66
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:29,790
[Running Man members are relegated
to their position in The Order.]

67
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,670
Is that my breakfast?

68
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,610
How is this steak?

69
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:43,910
[Frozen meal that anyone can enjoy
in the middle of the hot summer.]

70
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,100
I guess I should just be grateful
that I'm even getting this at all.

71
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:53,140
[A meal that's given to the person
in first place only.]

72
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:56,110
So no one else is getting this?

73
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,240
Everyone has different food depending on
which order they're in, don't they?

74
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:01,340
[Giraffe with his bean jelly.]

75
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:02,910
I'm so sick and tired of this.

76
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,990
Just how long do I have to keep
putting up with this kind of treatment!

77
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:10,130
I want some protein too!

78
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:13,940
Give me my steak!

79
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:17,800
<i>Running Man members, you are now all aware
of your own standings in The Order?</i>

80
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,240
I can't even hear what he's saying
down here in the basement.

81
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,590
<i>This isn't a guarantee of your
position in The Order.</i>

82
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:27,080
<i>But you will have several different chances
to change your position in The Order.</i>

83
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:30,930
<i>Your first mission which will give you
a chance at changing the order...</i>

84
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:33,950
<i>is the Snow Elevator.</i>

85
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:38,490
- The Snow Elevator.
- Snow elevator?

86
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:43,500
<i>You are all placed in different spots
depending on your position in The Order.</i>

87
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,530
<i>First place is on the very top floor</i>

88
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:49,570
<i>and seventh place is on the
very lowest level.</i>

89
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:51,440
<i>In order to change your position
in The Order</i>

90
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:55,380
<i>you must first board the elevator that will
take you up to higher floors in the building.</i>

91
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:59,310
<i>You must get off on the floor that is
higher than the floor that you're currently on</i>

92
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:02,960
<i>and by playing and winning a game,
you can take over that place in the order.</i>

93
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:06,930
<i>But, you only have one chance
to change your position per game</i>

94
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:09,590
<i>and the person who lands in the last place
per round will be eliminated</i>

95
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,400
<i>and will be given a treatment
very befitting of the position.</i>

96
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:17,420
<i>We wish everyone luck in maintaining your
upper position to avoid this treatment.</i>

97
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:20,270
<i>We will now start our first round.</i>

98
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,200
<i>For your first round...</i>

99
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:24,780
<i>it will be sixth position vs. seventh position.</i>

100
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:27,140
<i>Fifth place vs. fourth position.</i>

101
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:31,590
<i>And third place will compete
against second place.</i>

102
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:35,000
<i>If the person in the seventh place
loses this round</i>

103
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,530
<i>that person will firmly establish
their position in the seventh place</i>

104
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:38,880
<i>and will no longer be given any more chances
to escape from their position in rank.</i>

105
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,320
I won't have any more chances
to move up in my position?

106
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:45,490
This is the first and last chance
that I will ever have in my life.

107
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,140
My last chance to get away from this rubble
of trash that I'm so sick and tired of!

108
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:52,140
This is my first and final opportunity.

109
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:58,230
[None of the members are aware of
who is on which floor.]

110
00:06:58,230 --> 00:07:01,260
- Okay.
- Please board the elevator.

111
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,690
<i>Please board the elevator.</i>

112
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:14,300
[Basement Giraffe dreaming of moving up
in his position up to sixth place.]

113
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:25,540
Just how far are you planning on going
with all your transformations?

114
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,460
I've finally moved up one floor.

115
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,740
Hello.

116
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:37,650
- Hey, are you in last place?
- You're in sixth place?

117
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:40,620
- Why are you in sixth place?
- I don't know why I'm in sixth place either.

118
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:43,150
I thought the order was based on age,
but I guess that's not the case.

119
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:45,680
- I think the order is based on looks.
- Hey!

120
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:49,910
- Then why would I be in seventh place?
- You're in seventh place in looks.

121
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:53,880
- Gary! I'd be in fourth place, at least!
- You're just being absurd right now.

122
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:56,240
- Hurry up and get back down.
- Gary.

123
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,020
I bet you that you'll stay in
seventh place for the entire day.

124
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,250
It's no joke down there.

125
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:03,910
- You can't even betray anyone..
- No!

126
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:05,590
You can't even betray your way
out of this one!

127
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:08,080
You have to win this race based
purely on your skills.

128
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,440
Why don't we work together?

129
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,670
What do you mean, work together?
This is an individual battle.

130
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:14,390
This isn't a name tag elimination.

131
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:17,780
[Blank Ji on her way to compete with
the person in fourth place.]

132
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,900
What the heck?

133
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,400
- Ji Hyo, it's you?
- Ha Ha, you're in fourth place?

134
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:26,420
- Wow, I didn't know it was going to be you.
- What the heck is this?

135
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:28,270
This is too strong of an opponent
right from the beginning.

136
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,130
Anyone but Jong Kook.

137
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:33,310
I'd be happy with Ji Hyo.

138
00:08:33,310 --> 00:08:34,550
Someone's here!

139
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:35,880
The door is about to open!

140
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:44,600
[Oh no... the Tiger is here.]

141
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:48,370
Keep going up.

142
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,630
Just keep going up.

143
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:52,590
- I said, just go on up.
- Can you pass?

144
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:54,360
- Why is he here?
- Are you in third place?

145
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,430
<i>Here's your first round.</i>

146
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:01,390
<i>Your first round game is...</i>

147
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:03,920
<i>Your first round game is...</i>

148
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,500
I guarantee that I can beat you as long as
it's not the name tag elimination game.

149
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:10,700
<i>A one-on-one name tag
elimination game.</i>

150
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,300
<i>A one-on-one name tag
elimination game.</i>

151
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:17,600
<i>Your first round game is...</i>

152
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,570
<i>one-on-one name tag
elimination game.</i>

153
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:24,830
- One-on-one?
- A one-on-one name tag elimination game.

154
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:28,240
[First place winner can watch the
first round in the comfort of his seat.]

155
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,310
Bravo!

156
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,880
This is too much.

157
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:37,350
Why does it have to be this?
This is just absurd!

158
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:41,620
- This isn't really much of a competition.
- Then just give me your name tag.

159
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:43,600
I should make it entertaining, at least.

160
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,550
This is absolutely ridiculous.
It's absurd that this is the first game.

161
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:48,550
- That's what I'm saying.
- I guess it's better to be punished upfront.

162
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:50,840
I think it's better to just
get it over with.

163
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,680
Come on!

164
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:56,800
- Are you trying to use your strength on me?
- What other choice do I have?

165
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,990
- Suk Jin, I have no other choice.
- I can understand that you have to do this.

166
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:02,860
- I have no other choice, Gary.
- Nothing I can do about it either.

167
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:05,850
You're just made to live
on the bottom floor, Kwang Soo.

168
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:08,430
- I'm sick of having to eat the bean jelly!
- Okay, I hear you!

169
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:11,080
I should be doing this with Ha Ha instead.

170
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,560
[Neither are happy about having to
compete with each other.]

171
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,490
Kwang Soo, let's end this quickly!

172
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:16,740
Ji Hyo!

173
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,340
This isn't easy.

174
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:22,070
[With the exception of one floor,
the rest of the face-off's aren't as easy.]

175
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:27,640
[Basement Giraffe's attack.]

176
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:30,370
I vow... I vow to move up!

177
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:32,000
Hey!
What's wrong with you?

178
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,510
[Current seventh place holder
desperate to win his battle.]

179
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:41,780
[Simultaneously?]

180
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,520
[Wow! Seventh place holder,
Kwang Soo wins!]

181
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,890
I vow to move up in my rank!

182
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:55,260
[Fourth place Ha Ha and fifth place Blank Ji
taking a brief break.]

183
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:57,920
[Picking a strand of hair off of
Blank Ji's clothes.]

184
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,490
[Figures...]

185
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:06,580
You're such a cheater!

186
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:10,940
Ji Hyo!

187
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:14,510
[Fourth place Ro-Ro eliminates
Blank Ji's name tag.]

188
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:18,670
- I'm sorry, Ji Hyo. Forgive me just once.
- I won't have it!

189
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:21,600
How could you take me out
and cheat like that!

190
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:24,820
Ji Hyo could've won that battle
if her shirt hadn't been turned around.

191
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:27,060
I can tell that Ji Hyo's
really pissed right now.

192
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:31,770
I had no choice, Ji Hyo.

193
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:34,290
- I had no other choice.
- You tricked me!

194
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:38,560
[His cheap shot brings out
the thuggish Ji Hyo.]

195
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,090
I had no other choice, Ji Hyo.

196
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:42,640
Please understand where I'm coming from.

197
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:45,780
I wonder if there are any ropes around here?
I can leave you tied up here.

198
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:46,960
[And one obvious battle.]

199
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:49,620
[Second place holder, Big-nose
is backed up into a corner.]

200
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:53,090
I'm going to protect my second place!

201
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:57,510
[That doesn't seem to be possible...]

202
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,480
Did you tie me up or something?

203
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:03,830
[Not even able to budge a muscle
against Mr. Capable's strength.]

204
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:05,230
Why do you have me tied up?

205
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:08,430
Suk Jin... you have to stop moving.

206
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:12,440
I'm sorry. It's too hot
to be doing this in the summer.

207
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:16,730
It's really hot to be doing this
in the middle of the summer.

208
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:20,500
Being in third place isn't so bad.
I was actually pretty happy in third place.

209
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:22,630
I didn't even do anything.

210
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,670
You're going to be pretty cold
down there.

211
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:29,300
Go away. What kind of
a humiliation is this? Seriously.

212
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:32,610
- Why do you find this humiliating?
- Hurry up and just go away!

213
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:39,050
[The positions are starting to move around.]

214
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:44,990
I'll see you later.

215
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:46,560
- I've made up my resolve.
- Gary.

216
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,340
I'll see you later, Gary.

217
00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:50,690
I promise to move up in my position.

218
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:52,510
[Giraffe moves up one position
to sixth place.]

219
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:54,550
You're now delegated to being
in the last place.

220
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:57,670
But it's not forever.

221
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:02,650
[Gary is moved down to the basement.]

222
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:08,700
What the heck is this?
There's not even a place for me to sit?

223
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,450
[The sad reality of being in last place.]

224
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:17,500
[Gary's new position in
seventh place- Confirmed.]

225
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,860
<i>We will now start the second round.</i>

226
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:29,130
<i>For the second round...</i>

227
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:30,980
<i>sixth place will compete
against fifth place</i>

228
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:32,960
<i>fourth place against third place</i>

229
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:37,300
<i>and second place will compete against first
place for a chance to take over their position.</i>

230
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,220
That's Kim Jong Kook.

231
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:41,500
<i>If the sixth place holder loses
this round...</i>

232
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,370
<i>that person will establish
their spot as the sixth place holder</i>

233
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:46,300
<i>and will no longer have any more chances
to move up from their position.</i>

234
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:47,880
So it's all over for me if I lose this?

235
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,590
<i>You may now board the elevator.</i>

236
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:52,860
There are five people left to go.

237
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:00,500
I'm going to make it up to
the very top.

238
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:03,310
I'm going to put
everything I have on the line.

239
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:12,680
I wonder who'll be on this floor.

240
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,380
You scared me.

241
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:20,490
- Hey!
- Ji Hyo, you're in fifth place?

242
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:22,820
Are you in sixth place?
Were you in sixth place to begin with?

243
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,350
No, I moved up from seventh place.

244
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:27,720
[Third place holder, Big-nose
vs. Fourth place holder, Ha Ha.]

245
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,870
Have you been well?
Mr. Third Place Holder?

246
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:36,470
[Kkuk arrives at the very top floor.]

247
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,710
Muscle boy!

248
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:40,850
Hey, Muscle Boy.

249
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:45,550
[Muscle Boy makes it up
all the way to the top floor.]

250
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:47,730
Welcome, Muscle Boy.

251
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,690
Why are you going around
twitching your shoulders like that?

252
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:54,090
I guess you've been watching
everything that's been going on?

253
00:14:54,090 --> 00:14:55,950
I have been watching all that's been
going on since I'm in first place

254
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:57,870
and I had a steak for breakfast too.

255
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:00,160
Ah, I see.
What kind of a steak is that?

256
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,130
Is that the best they had for you?

257
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:06,190
While I was down there eating my bean jelly
amongst all the trash cans...

258
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:07,580
Did you have more bean jelly?

259
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:08,930
They're really good.

260
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:11,480
I had five of those things.

261
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:16,960
- They're about to make an announcement.
- We will now start the second round.

262
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:20,240
<i>For your second game...</i>

263
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:23,280
<i>For your second game...</i>

264
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,960
<i>you will play a round of the
hand slap game.</i>

265
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:29,690
<i>It's the hand slap game.</i>

266
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:33,530
<i>You will take turns slapping
the tops of each other's hands</i>

267
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:37,290
<i>and the first person to scream out loud
from the pain will lose this game.</i>

268
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:42,140
- Your next game will be the hand slap game.
- What kind of absurdity is this?

269
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:44,700
How does this make any sense?

270
00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:47,590
Let's talk about this first.
This game is absolutely ridiculous!

271
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:50,320
- You will now start the game.
- I'm good at enduring my pain.

272
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:53,400
- I'm confidant I'll win this.
- Five.

273
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:58,190
<i>Four, three, two, one.</i>

274
00:15:58,190 --> 00:15:59,620
This is insane.

275
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:03,320
Look at his arms.
Have you seen his arms?

276
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,990
Let me give you a tip.

277
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:08,360
You need to knock me out
with your first hit.

278
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,210
[He's telling Jae Suk to knock him out
with the first attack?]

279
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:11,620
I don't know about this.

280
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:14,060
If I can't get him in one shot,
then it's all over for me.

281
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:23,550
This isn't the arm of a human being!

282
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:28,730
Why are you getting all tense about this?
Can't you loosen up your hand a bit?

283
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:42,760
[It seems as though Yoo Hyuk is in
more pain for having slapped Jong Kook.]

284
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,460
My hand is a little sweaty today
from this heat.

285
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:47,800
- I feel like... it's going to be a good slap.
- I'm in trouble.

286
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:49,890
- Doesn't it even hurt?
- No, it doesn't hurt.

287
00:16:54,210 --> 00:16:56,440
[Preparing himself for the slap.]

288
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,720
[Cringing at Jong Kook's hand movement.]

289
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,090
- What's wrong?
- What?

290
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:06,820
Why did you pretend like
you were going to hit me?

291
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:08,210
Fine, I'll slap you.

292
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:10,460
It's not going to hurt as much
as you think.

293
00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:18,300
[Falling apart at the seams from
Muscle Boy's spike slap.]

294
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:23,590
[Silent gasps of pain due to the
inability to scream out loud.]

295
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:27,730
What's wrong?

296
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:29,590
Here.

297
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:35,320
This is seriously...

298
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:40,220
Here I go.

299
00:17:57,530 --> 00:17:58,950
Ugh, my palm is burning.

300
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:01,070
Ugh, my palm hurts even more.

301
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:05,120
[Fourth place vs. Third place-
Slapping each other's hands with glee.]

302
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:13,230
[Slapping each other back and forth
without any rest in between.]

303
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:25,500
[Sixth place vs. Fifth place-
Back and forth as expected.]

304
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:35,540
[Second floor on fire.]

305
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:44,510
Scream if it hurts.

306
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:46,090
Just scream if it hurts.

307
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:49,590
Call out your father's name, or your
brother's name. Just scream out loud!

308
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:51,640
I want to scream out so badly!

309
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:02,680
[It's Muscle Boy's turn to
attack on the sixth floor.]

310
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:20,310
[A slam dunk!]

311
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:22,770
He avoided it!

312
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:24,630
He avoided my slap.

313
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,380
He avoided the slap!

314
00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:31,730
He avoided the slap and I was
only able to hit him right here.

315
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:33,080
That hurts!

316
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:35,620
It hurts like you can't even imagine!

317
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:38,290
Look at my hand!
Look at the state my hand is in!

318
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:39,990
I don't think that was a proper slap,
so let's do it over.

319
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:42,800
- You can start.
- I just screamed out in pain!

320
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:44,630
I screamed out loud.

321
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,530
[Admitting that he screamed out loud.]

322
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:48,750
- It hurts! Hurts!
- I didn't really hear him.

323
00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:51,050
I can't do this!

324
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:54,100
[Taking it upon himself to switch out their
tags indicating their order.]

325
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:55,820
But I really didn't hear you
scream out loud.

326
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:57,570
- I screamed! You take it!
- But, it wasn't a proper slap!

327
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:59,200
Let go.
Let go of it.

328
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:02,840
[Second floor exchanging slaps
at a lightning fast speed.]

329
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:08,220
[Slapping himself in the face?]

330
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:09,710
You can't do that.

331
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:11,070
Let's switch hands.

332
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:15,200
Does it hurt?
Scream if your hand is hurting you.

333
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,000
It really tickles, and it's hard
for me to endure the laughter.

334
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,340
Really?
Then let's keep going.

335
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:20,110
It hurts.

336
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:22,150
Let's switch hands.

337
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:25,210
Here.
Me first?

338
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:27,840
[Starting over after having
switched out their hands.]

339
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:32,960
[A fierce battle because neither one of them
wants to be confirmed in sixth place.]

340
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:37,550
[Already on their 50th slap
on the fourth floor.]

341
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,850
Fine, I lost!
Hey!

342
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,780
[Big-nose throwing in the towel
from all the agony.]

343
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:51,360
How old are you?
How old are you!

344
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,960
[Still in the midst of their slap battle.]

345
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:05,370
[Explodes out in suppressed screams.]

346
00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:07,140
- It hurts!
- How much!

347
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,290
I feel like I'm going to die
from the pain!

348
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:11,600
This was already a
lost game from the beginning!

349
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,910
- I'm hurting too!
- I'm going to stay on the 6th floor forever!

350
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,870
[Kwang Soo fails his attempt to
move up any further in rank.]

351
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:20,860
Do you think that you'll be able to maintain
your first place position forever?

352
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:22,630
I did it!

353
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:26,060
[Ha Ha moves up to third place in rank.]

354
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:28,680
- Third place!
- Things are looking worse and worse.

355
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,810
Things are looking worse by the floor.

356
00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:36,400
[Kwang Soo confirms his spot in
sixth place from his basement origin.]

357
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:42,770
Are we going?

358
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,270
Heading towards second place in rank.

359
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:47,420
Let's go!

360
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,190
Moving up like this isn't
a bad feeling.

361
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:59,330
[Just who could be waiting for him
up on the sixth floor?]

362
00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:00,930
Is it Jong Kook?

363
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:15,710
Those are Jong Kook's shoes.

364
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:16,940
It's me.

365
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:20,940
- Welcome.
- It's you?

366
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,780
[The bickering brothers facing each other
for the second place rank.]

367
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:24,580
- Welcome.
- Let me see your hand.

368
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:27,130
[Hiding his right hand which is
beet red from the slapping.]

369
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:29,570
Oh my, look at how red it is.
Wow, Jae Suk.

370
00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:32,230
Your hand looks bruised.

371
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:34,000
- Can you guess who it was?
- Jong Kook.

372
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,560
Your place...

373
00:22:38,410 --> 00:22:39,560
is seventh place.

374
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:41,570
You've come too far up.

375
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,920
Do you know how this is ranked?
I'm asking if you know that.

376
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:48,600
- Isn't it in order of debut date?
- No, the face.

377
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,540
You're about fifth place in that.

378
00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:53,270
Yeah, you're in fifth place.

379
00:22:56,410 --> 00:23:00,170
<i>This round will determine who will be
confirmed in fifth place in ranking.</i>

380
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:03,420
<i>It's the Egg Roulette Game.</i>

381
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:06,970
- It's an Egg Roulette Game.
- Egg Roulette?

382
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:10,120
<i>You will take turns to cracking eggs
with your head...</i>

383
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,340
Ah, we have to find the raw egg?

384
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:15,260
<i>And I'm sure you can figure out
who loses the game when that time comes.</i>

385
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:16,350
This is all about luck.

386
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:18,840
You should've had us playing this game
when I was facing off with Jong Kook!

387
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:21,540
<i>Two, one, start.</i>

388
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:25,390
[Basking in the comfort of the top floor.]

389
00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:27,370
Yes, thank you.

390
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:34,000
[The cool and refreshing taste
of being in first place.]

391
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,100
The water is so cool and refreshing.
What amazing service.

392
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:37,970
You don't have to do all that.

393
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:41,230
Egg roulette?

394
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:44,230
What if Jae Suk comes back up here?

395
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:46,510
Seriously... he's lucky like that.

396
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,260
Who goes first?

397
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:51,200
[Person with the higher position
in ranking gets to go first.]

398
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,340
Can't be.
Can't be it already.

399
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:55,370
- First blow.
- Let's just be cool about this.

400
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:56,610
Let's just be cool about it.

401
00:23:57,690 --> 00:23:58,860
Okay!

402
00:24:01,670 --> 00:24:02,910
What if this is the one?

403
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:06,470
I worked so hard to get up here.

404
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:09,070
- Let it be the raw egg, let it be...
- Who dares to try to kick me out now?

405
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:12,420
[If he wins this round, he'll be
moving up to second place in rank!]

406
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:20,150
Come on, come on, come on!

407
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:22,840
Okay, come on!

408
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:25,600
[Will it be the raw egg?]

409
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,160
Come on!

410
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:29,060
Please.

411
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:32,850
[Hardboiled egg...]

412
00:24:36,430 --> 00:24:39,210
[Fifth place and Fourth place-
Third floor is also cracking away.]

413
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:44,120
This is all about the luck of the draw.

414
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:48,120
[A dull thud?]

415
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:50,050
You have to smack it really hard
for it not to hurt on your head.

416
00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:52,880
[Again!]

417
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:55,730
Why are you having such a hard time
cracking that open?

418
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:07,700
Come on, come on, come on!

419
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:18,700
[Back to Yoo Hyuk's turn.]

420
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,960
This is the game that I should've played
against Kim Jong Kook.

421
00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:36,450
I won!

422
00:25:36,450 --> 00:25:39,040
I'm number two!

423
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:42,970
Two, two, two!

424
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:45,970
Look at you.

425
00:25:45,970 --> 00:25:47,670
You did great.

426
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,080
You've been up here way too long.

427
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,000
I won!

428
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,960
Third place!

429
00:26:12,050 --> 00:26:13,570
Song Ji Hyo!

430
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:16,480
You've done great.

431
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,220
Why don't we grab dinner
together sometime?

432
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:20,860
Just remember that this
isn't the end.

433
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:25,320
- There will be another chance!
- What did you say, Mr. Third Place?

434
00:26:27,170 --> 00:26:28,300
I'm so annoyed!

435
00:26:37,530 --> 00:26:39,680
<i>I'm not going to let them
get away with this.</i>

436
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,580
Everyone has to hit the bottom
before they climb back up in their lives.

437
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,800
I really hate to say this...

438
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:50,820
but this place isn't
all that different from my house.

439
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:53,350
I have bean jelly at home too.

440
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,810
What's with all these flies!

441
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,230
Suk Jin won the game?

442
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:04,160
Wow, that's unbelievable.

443
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,350
Okay!

444
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:07,110
[Going back up a floor.]

445
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:11,760
Who knew the eggs would help
me out like that?

446
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:14,430
The eggs were a great help.

447
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,830
I love eggs!

448
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:20,340
I have to win this round.
I have to win it this time.

449
00:27:25,150 --> 00:27:27,730
- You're in third place?
- Welcome.

450
00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:29,220
Did you fall from first place?

451
00:27:29,730 --> 00:27:31,450
Which spot did you fall from?

452
00:27:32,810 --> 00:27:35,670
[Fourth and Third Place holders
warming up for their next game.]

453
00:27:40,730 --> 00:27:43,160
- I feel strangely confident.
- I feel good about this round.

454
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,800
I know I can beat Suk Jin.

455
00:27:44,810 --> 00:27:46,720
Hey, Ji Hyo was overly confident
and lost too.

456
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,620
Oh my... nice to see you again.

457
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,760
Climbing up is a hobby of mine.

458
00:27:56,590 --> 00:27:59,420
[Haroro taking on the first floor
after having started in fourth place.]

459
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:02,630
Come here, kiddo.

460
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,660
Mr. Jong Kook.

461
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:13,550
What's going on here?
Oh, you can see everything from here?

462
00:28:13,550 --> 00:28:14,700
Yeah, I enjoyed watching you guys.

463
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:16,870
Then I guess I can sit there and
watch once I'm first place?

464
00:28:16,870 --> 00:28:21,610
You've climbed up too high in the rank,
which doesn't really suit you.

465
00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:27,500
[First place and Second place holders'
tight mental battle.]

466
00:28:28,850 --> 00:28:30,470
<i>Your fourth round mission is...</i>

467
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:34,130
<i>Put on the workpants without
the use of your hands.</i>

468
00:28:34,130 --> 00:28:35,300
What?

469
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:37,030
<i>Put on the workpants without
the use of your hands.</i>

470
00:28:37,030 --> 00:28:38,090
- Huh?
- What?

471
00:28:41,330 --> 00:28:43,010
But we have to do this while lying down?

472
00:28:43,010 --> 00:28:44,670
[But it has to be done on top
of the acupuncture mat.]

473
00:28:45,570 --> 00:28:47,310
I'm feeling pretty competitive today.

474
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:50,000
Okay, you're feeling confident,
but you're still in fourth place.

475
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:51,920
I'm going to keep climbing up.

476
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:02,380
[Screaming out in pain
the moment the game starts.]

477
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:08,500
[Starting to interfere in each other's
progress in order to maintain their spot.]

478
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:14,200
[A child-like fight between the two
40-something men.]

479
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:25,640
Okay, this is good.

480
00:29:25,650 --> 00:29:27,370
- This is good.
- This is not really happening.

481
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:31,680
[Oh... already?]

482
00:29:32,650 --> 00:29:35,880
[The key is to get the pants
past their hips.]

483
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:38,810
Ouch, that hurts!

484
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:44,720
[Are they trying to launder the pants?]

485
00:29:48,270 --> 00:29:49,660
You need to hike them up
another three cm.

486
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,250
Where's the opening to these pants?

487
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:59,570
[Taking over Suk Jin's workpants!]

488
00:30:02,810 --> 00:30:05,320
Thanks, Suk Jin.
Thanks.

489
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:12,570
[Throws him off.]

490
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:19,320
[Even breaking down into a belly dance
in an attempt to hike up the pants.]

491
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:28,820
[Utilizing any sharp points.]

492
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:30,180
Sorry, Suk Jin.

493
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:31,700
I have no other choice right now.

494
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,970
- Seriously!
- How can I hike these up?

495
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:41,600
[Suk Jin's legs?]

496
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:45,840
[Exhaustion hits.]

497
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,120
I got it.

498
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,590
I got them on.

499
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:55,990
[Yoo Hyuk wins.]

500
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:57,950
Thanks for your help.

501
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:04,530
[Suk Jin's position
confirmed in fourth place.]

502
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:08,210
[Working themselves into a frenzy.]

503
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,320
[On the acupuncture mat,
known to be good for blood circulation.]

504
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:15,190
[Just who will take the first place?]

505
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:16,270
I got it!

506
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,910
[Ha Ha wins!]

507
00:31:25,670 --> 00:31:31,070
[A personal win! Takes over first place
after having started out in fourth place!]

508
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:34,730
I'm number one!

509
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:40,220
[Yoo Hyuk, currently in third place
goes back up a floor to second.]

510
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:43,380
Please, anyone but Kim Jong Kook.

511
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:46,760
[But his opponent is...]

512
00:31:47,550 --> 00:31:48,860
There you are.

513
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:50,850
- Listen...
- You're here.

514
00:31:50,850 --> 00:31:54,400
- Did you lose to the kiddo?
- The kiddo has a lower butt than I do.

515
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,630
You'd better get yourself ready
to go down a level.

516
00:31:56,630 --> 00:31:59,100
- You can just keep that tag on.
- What did you say?

517
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:00,920
- What did you say?
- I'm just going to end it for you here.

518
00:32:00,930 --> 00:32:03,340
This hand still doesn't feel like
my own hand!

519
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:04,660
Let me see.

520
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:06,930
What's wrong with your hand?

521
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:09,670
<i>It's now time to determine who
will be in third place.</i>

522
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:11,940
<i>Your next mission...</i>

523
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,920
Let's do a game like the egg game.

524
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:16,050
<i>Is one-on-one table tennis.</i>

525
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:19,520
- Table tennis?
- Instead of your normal tennis racket...

526
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,990
<i>you're going to use other items to
hit the tennis ball.</i>

527
00:32:23,030 --> 00:32:25,460
<i>The first person to score seven points
wins the game.</i>

528
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:28,070
- Then do I get to choose the prop first?
- What did you say?

529
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:32,540
[Kkuk gets to choose the prop first
for being higher up in rank.]

530
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:37,380
- This one looks good.
- Once you grab it, you have to stick with it.

531
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:39,140
- What are you talking about?
- You have to stick with that one now.

532
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:40,860
I think this would be good for attacking.

533
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:43,100
[Second place Kkuk being meticulous
about which prop he chooses.]

534
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:45,110
- But for playing defense, maybe this one?
- Come on.

535
00:32:46,050 --> 00:32:47,730
Maybe this will be better?

536
00:32:47,730 --> 00:32:49,870
Maybe this would be better for it.

537
00:32:49,870 --> 00:32:51,920
When you were slapping my hand earlier...

538
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,990
your hand felt like a frying pan.

539
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:57,690
[Second place holder Kkuk chooses
the hand fan.]

540
00:32:57,690 --> 00:32:58,870
I'll go with this one.

541
00:32:58,870 --> 00:33:00,820
[Third place holder Yoo Hyuk chooses
to go with the frying pan.]

542
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:02,010
Here I go.

543
00:33:06,850 --> 00:33:08,280
Okay, let's start.

544
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:12,790
That's right!

545
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:15,170
[Yoo Hyuk- 1 vs. Kkuk- 0.]

546
00:33:15,610 --> 00:33:17,950
- This has no strength.
- This puts a spin on the ball.

547
00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:19,850
This thing has a spin to it.

548
00:33:19,850 --> 00:33:20,930
Give me the ball.

549
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:24,330
- You made a bad decision.
- This has no power. I have to hit it hard.

550
00:33:25,290 --> 00:33:26,580
That's right!

551
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:30,150
[Yoo Hyuk- 2 vs. Kkuk- 0.]

552
00:33:30,150 --> 00:33:32,430
- Hurry up and do it.
- Okay.

553
00:33:32,790 --> 00:33:34,420
- It's two to one, right?
- Yes.

554
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:38,940
[Yoo Hyuk- 2 vs. Kkuk- 1]

555
00:33:45,450 --> 00:33:46,700
Ah! Two to two!

556
00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:48,840
[Yoo Hyuk- 2 vs. Kkuk- 2]

557
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:50,390
I'm used to this now!

558
00:33:55,390 --> 00:33:58,250
[Yoo Hyuk- 4 vs. Kkuk- 3]

559
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:00,890
That's right!

560
00:34:00,890 --> 00:34:02,720
- There's nothing to this.
- That's right!

561
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,020
That's right!

562
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:07,270
[Yoo Hyuk- 5 vs. Kkuk- 3]

563
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:08,640
You and I are a great fit.

564
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:10,500
There's no need to put too much
strength behind this.

565
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,580
Let's go.

566
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:17,560
That's right!

567
00:34:18,950 --> 00:34:21,770
[Yoo Hyuk- 6 vs. Kkuk- 3]

568
00:34:21,770 --> 00:34:22,870
- This is the last point.
- I know!

569
00:34:22,870 --> 00:34:24,630
- This is the game point.
- Let's go.

570
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:30,520
[Yoo Hyuk- 6 vs. Kkuk- 4]

571
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:39,970
[A spike serve!]

572
00:34:43,070 --> 00:34:44,440
Awesome.

573
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:47,080
Don't hold yourself back, Jong Kook.
Don't hold yourself back.

574
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:49,350
- I can't believe how this is turning out.
- I'm good under pressure.

575
00:34:49,350 --> 00:34:51,110
Let's play real table tennis now, Jong Kook.
Real table tennis.

576
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,670
Just think of this as a
regular table tennis game.

577
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:01,230
[An ambush attack?]

578
00:35:07,570 --> 00:35:09,990
[He fails at his trick attack.]

579
00:35:12,790 --> 00:35:14,080
Wow, that was amazing.

580
00:35:14,090 --> 00:35:15,600
Okay, it's a deuce.

581
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:18,490
[Yoo Hyuk- 6 vs. Kkuk- 6.
Deuce.]

582
00:35:18,490 --> 00:35:22,480
Who am I, and what's going on here?
Don't you know what a deuce is?

583
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:29,000
It's impossible to predict who'll win.

584
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,820
Just get going!

585
00:35:37,490 --> 00:35:40,220
I'm going to end it this time.
Let's just end it here, Jong Kook.

586
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:41,710
Just take it easy.

587
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:45,440
- Take it easy.
- That's right!

588
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,700
[Yoo Hyuk- 7 vs. Kkuk- 7.
An even score again!]

589
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:50,530
- Just take it easy, okay?
- What happened?

590
00:35:50,530 --> 00:35:51,920
- This is a little slow.
- That was good.

591
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:54,090
I feel like we're at
the Olympics right now.

592
00:35:54,890 --> 00:35:57,460
[Running Man's bitter rivals-
Hyuk and Kkuk.]

593
00:35:57,470 --> 00:36:01,060
[Who knew that sparks would be flying
during the table tennis match like this?]

594
00:36:08,610 --> 00:36:11,090
[Pulling out all the moves- Unbelievable.]

595
00:36:11,090 --> 00:36:15,120
You don't even see that move very often
during the Olympics.

596
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:17,630
[A surprise attack while Kkuk is
too busy talking.]

597
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:19,600
[But he catches the serve!]

598
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:24,970
That's not a move that you
see very often.

599
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,630
I won!

600
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:37,350
[7 vs. 9.
Kkuk wins!]

601
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:39,980
[Enraged...]

602
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:42,260
I can't believe I lost.

603
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:45,030
- I guess I'll be going back up now.
- There was even the cheating.

604
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:47,350
What did you say?
You're the one who cheated.

605
00:36:47,350 --> 00:36:49,270
That's what I mean.
I cheated.

606
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,350
You're the one who cheated!

607
00:36:50,350 --> 00:36:52,600
According to the rules... I should've waited
to serve when he was ready.

608
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:54,240
- But I jumped the gun on that.
- It's okay, I can let that go.

609
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:56,530
<i>In that case, we'll declare that
you lost by cheating.</i>

610
00:36:58,620 --> 00:37:00,580
I seriously can't believe I lost!

611
00:37:01,890 --> 00:37:04,400
It looks like I'll be competing
against Mr. Jong Kook again.

612
00:37:04,870 --> 00:37:07,170
[Yoo Hyuk confirmed for third place.]

613
00:37:07,170 --> 00:37:08,800
Seriously... I went easy on you.

614
00:37:10,410 --> 00:37:13,090
- That was an unbelievable win.
- I still can't believe I lost!

615
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:16,150
I could've won that game.

616
00:37:22,770 --> 00:37:25,770
<i>We will now move on to
the final round.</i>

617
00:37:26,450 --> 00:37:29,550
<i>This final round... is the playoff round.</i>

618
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:32,240
<i>This round will determine the first and
second place holder in rank</i>

619
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:34,410
<i>and the person who wins this game</i>

620
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:37,640
<i>will take over first place in rank
for the time being.</i>

621
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:42,190
I have to play with the kiddo again?

622
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:46,450
[In the midst of dining?]

623
00:37:46,450 --> 00:37:48,270
Seriously...

624
00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:52,660
Wait just a little bit longer.

625
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:54,350
I'm almost finished with my meal.

626
00:37:57,230 --> 00:37:58,790
This is a great meal.

627
00:37:59,430 --> 00:38:01,660
So you made your way
back up here?

628
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:04,240
Well, since the seat belonged to me
in the first place...

629
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:08,550
[The last final round which will determine
who will take over first place in rank.]

630
00:38:08,550 --> 00:38:09,900
- You did great work.
- Yes.

631
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:12,100
- This is your final round.
- Yes.

632
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:14,520
<i>No matter who wins between
the two of you</i>

633
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:18,080
<i>the person who comes in at second place
must be completely obedient of the winner.</i>

634
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:23,070
<i>The first place winner will be determined
by a round of table tennis ball toss.</i>

635
00:38:23,530 --> 00:38:25,540
[Table tennis ball toss.]

636
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:29,010
The first person to toss the ball
into the wine glass...

637
00:38:29,010 --> 00:38:31,260
[The first person to bounce the ball and
land it in the wineglass wins the game.]

638
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:34,840
Just think about it lightly.
This game is advantageous for you.

639
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:41,270
[The other members with confirmed ranks
join to watch the match.]

640
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,220
I should be the one playing in this round.

641
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:45,490
[Haroro's attempt to take over first place
that surprises everyone.]

642
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:50,310
But how did we get ranked when we
first got here anyways?

643
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,300
- Isn't it in the order of our debut?
- Our debut years?

644
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:54,260
[It was determined in the order
of your variety debut.]

645
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:56,920
Ah, variety show debut?

646
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:58,570
Variety show debut date.

647
00:38:58,570 --> 00:39:00,780
[Must score the ball
in this wine glass to win.]

648
00:39:01,270 --> 00:39:03,970
The person who wins first place right now,
will have one chance

649
00:39:03,970 --> 00:39:07,230
to chance to change the order
between third and seventh place holders.

650
00:39:07,230 --> 00:39:09,750
- They can change their spots?
- Only the first place winner?

651
00:39:11,130 --> 00:39:12,860
I'm going to have to win this.
- Wow.

652
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:15,510
Then does it mean that he can switch
from seventh to third position?

653
00:39:15,510 --> 00:39:16,900
Yes, he can do that.

654
00:39:16,910 --> 00:39:18,780
[Possible to switch from
seventh to third place.]

655
00:39:19,410 --> 00:39:22,380
- Kim Jong Kook! Kim Jong Kook!
- Ha Ha! Ha Ha!

656
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:24,940
- Kim Jong Kook!
- Ha Ha!

657
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:27,920
Excuse me, Mr. Jae Suk?
Can you hand me one too?

658
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:30,260
- Yes, no problem.
- Oh my, I dropped my balls.

659
00:39:34,450 --> 00:39:36,670
[Transformation-
A smart Kwang-retriever.]

660
00:39:39,030 --> 00:39:40,870
[You must be hot!]

661
00:39:42,010 --> 00:39:43,480
[Ha Ha takes the first turn.]

662
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:46,320
[Very close, but misses!]

663
00:39:46,890 --> 00:39:48,730
- Here you go, I wiped it up for you.
- Okay.

664
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:52,000
[Kwang-retriever following Ha Ha
around like a loyal puppy.]

665
00:39:53,410 --> 00:39:54,880
[Kkuk's turn.]

666
00:39:56,270 --> 00:39:58,980
[Not even close...]

667
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,300
I'm sorry.

668
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:04,890
[Kwang-retriever playing havoc
with Kkuk's mental state.]

669
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:15,480
Think of this as your last chance.

670
00:40:17,850 --> 00:40:20,640
[That was so close!]

671
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:23,410
- This is making me nervous.
- This isn't an easy shot.

672
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:27,870
[On the other hand, it seems like Kkuk
still hasn't gotten the feel for it.]

673
00:40:28,710 --> 00:40:30,460
I think I'm getting the feel for it.

674
00:40:31,970 --> 00:40:34,710
[Suggesting that they divide
up the cheer crowd.]

675
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:38,410
[Huh?
Gary's standing behind Kkuk?]

676
00:40:40,770 --> 00:40:42,660
I've always stood behind Jong Kook.

677
00:40:51,570 --> 00:40:54,580
[Again, that was so close!]

678
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:56,630
- Where are you going, Gary?
- I've always stood right back here.

679
00:40:56,630 --> 00:40:58,710
[Seventh place holder Gary sliding over
to stand behind Ha Ha?]

680
00:41:01,890 --> 00:41:03,860
It's okay, it's okay.
I know I can do this.

681
00:41:06,610 --> 00:41:08,390
[It seems as though Ro-Ro has gotten
a total hang of this game.]

682
00:41:08,390 --> 00:41:10,110
We're all dead if you don't win this.

683
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:20,740
[Continuing on with the close call shots.]

684
00:41:20,750 --> 00:41:22,430
I got it now.
I know what I have to do now.

685
00:41:22,430 --> 00:41:23,560
Here I go.

686
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:30,120
[Thus, they kept on repeating their
moves over and over again...]

687
00:41:30,370 --> 00:41:32,120
<i>Since the glass is a bit small...</i>

688
00:41:32,150 --> 00:41:35,630
<i>we will switch it out to a larger glass
with the current first place to make it fair.</i>

689
00:41:35,630 --> 00:41:37,340
- Sounds good.
- With that one?

690
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:39,700
[Switching out the glass for a container
with a wider mouth.]

691
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:42,260
[With this turn of events, the
next shot could determine the winner!]

692
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:48,430
[Yet again, another very close call!]

693
00:41:50,770 --> 00:41:53,360
[The winner could be determined
with just one shot!]

694
00:41:56,530 --> 00:41:57,910
You have to score it now!

695
00:42:00,810 --> 00:42:02,260
Can you move all the way down?

696
00:42:06,010 --> 00:42:07,850
What is this?
This ball is crushed.

697
00:42:07,850 --> 00:42:08,900
I'm sorry.

698
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:13,280
[He handed him a crushed ball...]

699
00:42:13,770 --> 00:42:16,450
He really is trying to undermine
my chances of winning.

700
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:18,180
[Kwang-retriever's unabashed attempt to
interfere in Jong Kook's game.]

701
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:21,310
I totally lost the feel for it.

702
00:42:22,150 --> 00:42:23,230
Challenge.

703
00:42:27,970 --> 00:42:30,680
[Again!]

704
00:42:35,910 --> 00:42:38,230
[The end seems imminent for this match!]

705
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:40,130
They both have the feel for it.

706
00:42:40,410 --> 00:42:41,660
Challenge.

707
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:46,210
There you go!

708
00:42:48,570 --> 00:42:49,790
There you go!

709
00:42:49,790 --> 00:42:51,570
[He scores!]

710
00:43:01,230 --> 00:43:02,540
Come here, Mister.

711
00:43:04,570 --> 00:43:05,570
Mister.

712
00:43:05,570 --> 00:43:07,970
[Explodes at Yoo Hyuk whom he's had
a lot of pent up grudges against.]

713
00:43:11,150 --> 00:43:13,540
I'm number one!

714
00:43:14,290 --> 00:43:17,140
[Lower rank people all gathering
around Ha Ha.]

715
00:43:17,990 --> 00:43:20,580
Excuse me, you all need to
apologize to him.

716
00:43:20,580 --> 00:43:22,380
You all need to apologize to him!

717
00:43:23,610 --> 00:43:25,220
Everyone line up in front of me.

718
00:43:27,050 --> 00:43:28,360
Seriously.

719
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:31,580
<i>As I have told you earlier,
people that are in third to seventh place...</i>

720
00:43:32,020 --> 00:43:34,660
<i>the first place winner can switch
one person out of their position.</i>

721
00:43:34,930 --> 00:43:36,760
Please, Sir!

722
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:39,470
I really want to switch out one of you.

723
00:43:39,470 --> 00:43:42,070
Both of you were a lot of help to me.

724
00:43:42,070 --> 00:43:44,950
- I really believed in you.
- I was behind you from the beginning.

725
00:43:44,950 --> 00:43:47,060
[Feeling nervous.]

726
00:43:47,060 --> 00:43:48,680
I really don't want to go
down any further.

727
00:43:50,220 --> 00:43:55,060
Kang Gary and Yoo Jae Suk,
switch your positions.

728
00:43:55,060 --> 00:43:59,040
[With the authority of first position holder,
third and seventh position swaps spots.]

729
00:43:59,570 --> 00:44:01,190
Was I being too obvious?

730
00:44:01,540 --> 00:44:03,280
I don't know if that was
too obvious of a move.

731
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:04,800
I won't let you get away with this.

732
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:07,090
I can't go down any further than this!

733
00:44:07,090 --> 00:44:09,340
- What did you just say?
- What are you going to do about it now?

734
00:44:09,340 --> 00:44:11,460
[Seventh place holder exploding in rage.]

735
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:13,450
I can't fall any further from
where I'm at!

736
00:44:13,460 --> 00:44:15,850
- What are you going to do?
- You just wait and see.

737
00:44:15,850 --> 00:44:18,250
Don't tell me what to do!

738
00:44:18,250 --> 00:44:19,940
- Do I tell you what to do?
- There's nothing else you can do to me now!

739
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:23,050
- I'm your boss!
- How are you my boss?

740
00:44:23,050 --> 00:44:25,000
- I am your boss!
- How do you think that you're my boss?

741
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,830
- Please keep your composure.
- Okay, I understand.

742
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:30,760
<i>I will now reveal to you the differences
between all the ranks.</i>

743
00:44:30,770 --> 00:44:33,720
[Everything from this point on will be
determined by their position in rank.]

744
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:36,110
<i>You all have to take very good care
of your own things.</i>

745
00:44:36,110 --> 00:44:38,260
You need to experience what it's
like to hit rock bottom.

746
00:44:38,260 --> 00:44:41,420
I want you all to observe how I'll use this
to work my way back up to the top.

747
00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:43,390
I have six.

748
00:44:43,390 --> 00:44:45,650
[Gold coins that are distributed
according to the ranked position.]

749
00:44:45,650 --> 00:44:48,240
This gold in my hand looks so good after
having looked at bean jelly for so long.

750
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:51,920
<i>You will continue to earn your
gold coins in this manner.</i>

751
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:56,190
<i>You will continue to play for rank.
We will now move on to the lunch segment.</i>

752
00:44:56,190 --> 00:44:59,360
[Off to dine!]

753
00:45:01,370 --> 00:45:06,500
[First round of Snow Elevator-
Currently ranked positions.]

754
00:45:06,510 --> 00:45:10,830
[The icy locale...
suddenly transforms into summer.]

755
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:13,420
Gary just proved that one single moment
can change a person's life.

756
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:17,680
Don't you remember how I told you all
that I'm going to turn my life around?

757
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:20,010
Playing all those countless games
isn't the point here.

758
00:45:20,010 --> 00:45:21,950
Who knew that Gary would work himself
up to third place like that?

759
00:45:21,950 --> 00:45:24,630
Do you know how good it feels to have
Jae Suk below me in standing right now?

760
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:27,320
You have no idea what that means.
You and I always gets beat by him.

761
00:45:28,210 --> 00:45:30,870
Right now is your chance.
Take your opportunity.

762
00:45:30,870 --> 00:45:32,360
[All the shame and indignity
that they've been put through...]

763
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:38,560
[Something feels off about this...]

764
00:45:39,660 --> 00:45:42,860
It must feel so uncomfortable for you to
have me above you like this.

765
00:45:44,150 --> 00:45:46,750
- This position is uncomfortable for me.
- Listen, Kwang Soo.

766
00:45:46,750 --> 00:45:49,570
Are you kidding me?
What are you doing over there?

767
00:45:49,570 --> 00:45:51,500
- Listen, seventh place holder?
- Yes?

768
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:53,930
What kind of a brutish behavior
are you exhibiting right now?

769
00:45:58,220 --> 00:46:00,150
Seventh place holder just shoved me!

770
00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:03,890
People without any future or hopes are the
ones you should watch out for the most.

771
00:46:05,070 --> 00:46:08,570
[First place holder trying to put
the order back into the rankings.]

772
00:46:08,570 --> 00:46:11,170
[Trying to enforce everyone back in line
according to their rank with a wrist slap.]

773
00:46:11,170 --> 00:46:13,220
- Don't judge us like this.
- Why don't we do this instead?

774
00:46:13,220 --> 00:46:14,890
Look at it this way, you can hit Jae Suk.

775
00:46:14,890 --> 00:46:16,730
Then do we do it in a relay?

776
00:46:16,730 --> 00:46:19,900
[Wrist slap to be done in a relay form
down the line in ranked position.]

777
00:46:19,910 --> 00:46:22,160
Okay, let's start.
Go ahead and hit me.

778
00:46:24,260 --> 00:46:25,610
Pass it on.

779
00:46:27,150 --> 00:46:29,710
[Is he actually passing that on?]

780
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:32,140
[Confused with what's going on.]

781
00:46:32,140 --> 00:46:34,340
I have no more room to fall
from where I'm standing right now.

782
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:35,820
- In that case...
- Yes?

783
00:46:35,820 --> 00:46:38,710
- You two swap your spots.
- Okay, that makes more sense.

784
00:46:40,550 --> 00:46:44,820
[Sixth place holder who behaved more like
seventh place holder ultimately...]

785
00:46:46,570 --> 00:46:48,200
[Outraged!]

786
00:46:51,150 --> 00:46:55,910
[Having the Giraffe be the youngest in
the group is desirable in many ways?]

787
00:46:56,830 --> 00:46:58,320
- Yes, this works.
- Pass it on.

788
00:46:58,320 --> 00:46:59,790
Are you out of your mind?

789
00:46:59,790 --> 00:47:03,670
[Teaching a stiff lesson to
the mannerless youngest member.]

790
00:47:03,670 --> 00:47:05,900
Don't you have any manners?

791
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:10,630
[Entering the diner after having confirmed
everyone's position in the rank.]

792
00:47:10,630 --> 00:47:11,810
I'm so hungry.

793
00:47:12,110 --> 00:47:15,270
[What kind of differential treatment
awaits them inside the restaurant?]

794
00:47:15,270 --> 00:47:16,720
- What is this?
- What kind of a meal is it?

795
00:47:16,730 --> 00:47:18,250
- What is this?
- They're all different.

796
00:47:19,550 --> 00:47:20,830
Wow, that's a traditional formal meal!

797
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:30,140
[This is the meal table for
the first place holder.]

798
00:47:32,030 --> 00:47:35,180
[Second place holder's menu.]

799
00:47:35,180 --> 00:47:37,640
[Third place winner's meal.]

800
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:39,440
I love seaweed soup!

801
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:43,760
Up to fifth place holder is pretty good.

802
00:47:51,020 --> 00:47:53,160
[Even though it's a humble affair,
their menu is still full of nutrition.]

803
00:47:53,430 --> 00:47:55,580
- Let's all sit down.
- This is amazing.

804
00:47:56,920 --> 00:47:58,860
- Is that tuna?
- Ji Hyo's isn't bad either.

805
00:47:59,890 --> 00:48:04,120
[Seventh place holder, Kwang Soo's meal.]

806
00:48:05,950 --> 00:48:07,040
Dong Hoon.

807
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:10,720
Just be grateful that you even got that.

808
00:48:12,270 --> 00:48:14,340
I don't even get a chair?
I have to sit on this newspaper?

809
00:48:15,980 --> 00:48:20,160
[His own chef carefully grilling up
the meat for him on the grill.]

810
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:21,940
He's even grilling the meat for him?

811
00:48:22,350 --> 00:48:24,610
- Kwang Soo? Come here.
- Yes, Dong Hoon?

812
00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:26,310
- Excuse me?
- Come here.

813
00:48:27,430 --> 00:48:29,630
I feel bad about what happened,
so come over here.

814

[Even though it's a little late, is he
trying to reward Giraffe for his help?]

815
00:48:36,470 --> 00:48:37,790
Here, just take it.

816
00:48:39,550 --> 00:48:40,770
What are you doing?

817
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:43,080
- Was that not enough?
- What in the world is this?

818
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:46,250
[Big bro in first place slipping some
cabbage leaves over to his little bro.]

819
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:50,160
- Ha Ha's more generous than I thought.
- Thanks.

820
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:52,330
Can you pass some of the
meat down here?

821
00:48:53,210 --> 00:48:55,380
You sure are greedy down there!

822
00:48:55,380 --> 00:48:56,800
I'm sorry.

823
00:48:59,820 --> 00:49:01,630
I really like how this is playing out.

824
00:49:02,490 --> 00:49:05,450
I really feel like I'm going to start
crying in the middle of my meal.

825
00:49:05,890 --> 00:49:07,180
Seriously!

826
00:49:07,180 --> 00:49:09,660
- Would you like one of my eggs, Jae Suk?
- Yes, sure!

827
00:49:09,660 --> 00:49:12,420
- Come here.
- That looks really good.

828
00:49:13,260 --> 00:49:15,070
- Can I eat this?
- Sure.

829
00:49:15,670 --> 00:49:18,280
- You can take the whole egg.
- Thank you so much.

830
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:20,270
You want something too?

831
00:49:20,270 --> 00:49:21,930
- One of these?
- Yes, go ahead.

832
00:49:21,930 --> 00:49:23,350
Thank you!

833
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:27,110
I'll wear this in the suit pocket the
next time I have to attend a wedding.

834
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:31,860
- Hey, bring that egg over here.
- No, thanks.

835

Say something about how you feel.

1000
00:57:53,160 --> 00:57:55,700
- What do you want me to say?
- It's way too hot in here!

1001
00:57:55,700 --> 00:57:57,950
I don't think that we should let this go.

1002
00:57:57,960 --> 00:57:59,910
The wind blowing outside is
making it even hotter in here.

1003
00:57:59,910 --> 00:58:03,050
[Having their windows open is only helping
to blow in all the hot air from outside.]

1004
00:58:06,020 --> 00:58:09,180
You have to use that camera to film me.

1005
00:58:09,190 --> 00:58:12,260
- My phone doesn't have much battery left.
- You have to use it to film me.

1006
00:58:12,270 --> 00:58:14,180
- Hello.
- Can we take a picture of you?

1007
00:58:14,180 --> 00:58:15,370
Yes, sure.

1008
00:58:15,370 --> 00:58:18,450
[With their windows rolled down, everyone
driving by can watch and be amused.]

1009
00:58:18,450 --> 00:58:21,790
How am I supposed to use this when you have
it password locked with a code I don't know?

1010
00:58:23,210 --> 00:58:25,910
[I guess that's the end of Kwang Soo's
face on this episode...]

1011
00:58:28,140 --> 00:58:29,500
Goodbye!

1012
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:33,540
[Pulling up right next to the upper crust
in their luxury car.]

1013
00:58:34,410 --> 00:58:35,890
That's just ridiculous.

1014
00:58:35,890 --> 00:58:37,930
- Wow!
- I'm so envious right now.

1015
00:58:37,930 --> 00:58:41,270
[Endless jealousy.]

1016
00:58:41,270 --> 00:58:44,140
[Nice and cool...]

1017
00:58:47,980 --> 00:58:50,940
[Giraffe trying to turn the
air conditioner on.]

1018
00:58:50,940 --> 00:58:54,620
No, don't do it!
You can't do that!

1019
00:58:56,050 --> 00:58:58,050
Don't turn the air conditioner on!

1020
00:58:58,050 --> 00:59:00,670
- You're going to get us stranded.
- I can't stand this heat!

1021
00:59:01,060 --> 00:59:03,080
What am I supposed to do when I
feel like I can't even breathe?

1022
00:59:03,620 --> 00:59:06,410
Kwang Soo, go get us some water.
Get us some ice water.

1023
00:59:06,410 --> 00:59:08,360
I don't have any money.

1024
00:59:09,110 --> 00:59:11,000
You have to film me with
that camera!

1025
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:12,340
Film Jae Suk.

1026
00:59:13,330 --> 00:59:15,350
I can't even roll my window
down over here.

1027
00:59:15,660 --> 00:59:16,930
Where are we going?

1028
00:59:17,860 --> 00:59:20,870
[No end in sight to their driving...]

1029
00:59:21,620 --> 00:59:23,390
How fast are you driving?

1030
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:26,680
You're only going 70km an hour
when the car is being this loud?

1031
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:28,410
This is...

1032
00:59:33,470 --> 00:59:36,300
Whenever anything passes by next to us,
it sounds like a tiger is roaring in my ear.

1033
00:59:38,420 --> 00:59:41,130
Every time a car passes by next to me,
it sounds like a huge roar.

1034
00:59:42,980 --> 00:59:44,960
[Are you still alive?]

1035
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:46,910
Hope you realize how lucky you
are right now.

1036
00:59:48,410 --> 00:59:50,370
Do you know how hot it is
in here right now?

1037
00:59:50,370 --> 00:59:52,900
[Taking his anger out on his VJ
who's riding in the car next to him.]

1038
00:59:53,750 --> 00:59:55,810
- We're here.
- Haven't we been here before?

1039
00:59:55,810 --> 00:59:58,020
- I think we were here before.
- You're right.

1040
00:59:58,030 --> 01:00:01,310
[Arriving at the tidal shore where
they wrestled Chu Sung Hoon.]

1041
01:00:01,310 --> 01:00:03,470
- This is that same tidal shore.
- Ugh, tidal shore.

1042
01:00:04,090 --> 01:00:08,100
[First through third place arrives at their
destination in comfort and ease.]

1043
01:00:09,100 --> 01:00:10,510
Do we have to change our clothes?

1044
01:00:11,230 --> 01:00:12,470
Wow, it's so hot.

1045
01:00:12,770 --> 01:00:14,460
- Kwang Soo.
- Yes, Jae Suk.

1046
01:00:14,460 --> 01:00:16,440
It feels a little bit cooler
when you open the door.

1047
01:00:16,840 --> 01:00:19,950
[Opening the door isn't going to
feel that much cooler.]

1048
01:00:20,730 --> 01:00:22,600
I'm just grateful that this car
even made it here.

1049
01:00:25,550 --> 01:00:27,990
[The Rank Determining Race-
Second mission location- Tidal Shore.]

1050
01:00:27,990 --> 01:00:31,210
This is your second mission of your
Rank Determination Race.

1051
01:00:31,650 --> 01:00:33,390
It's the Line of Rank mission.

1052
01:00:33,390 --> 01:00:34,530
What does it entail?

1053
01:00:34,530 --> 01:00:36,510
Dong Wan is going to kick
the ball in his hand.

1054
01:00:37,010 --> 01:00:43,230
You have to pick up the ball that he kicks,
and the person to get to the flag first wins.

1055
01:00:43,230 --> 01:00:46,050
You have to pull the flag out of the ground
in order for you to pass.

1056
01:00:46,050 --> 01:00:48,670
The winner will be determined
in the order of your arrival.

1057
01:00:48,670 --> 01:00:52,190
The first person to arrive and get the flag
will take over the first place.

1058
01:00:52,190 --> 01:00:55,200
Do you see the chaise lounge and
the parasol that is set up over there?

1059
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:58,370
That's where the first place winner gets to
rest until the race is over.

1060
01:00:59,380 --> 01:01:01,430
- This is really...
- Wow.

1061
01:01:01,430 --> 01:01:03,610
I have to place within the top three
spots to make my life a little bit easier.

1062
01:01:03,610 --> 01:01:06,700
I really want to come in within
the first three spots.

1063
01:01:06,700 --> 01:01:08,960
People who haven't been in that car
don't even have the right to say anything.

1064
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:10,630
Is it fourth through seventh place
that has to ride around in that car?

1065
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:12,360
- Yes, of course.
- Let's win this!

1066
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:17,050
[Determined to do whatever it takes
in order to avoid getting back in the car.]

1067
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:18,780
Ready!

1068
01:01:18,780 --> 01:01:20,090
[First round of second mission.]

1069
01:01:20,090 --> 01:01:21,600
Set, go!

1070
01:01:23,060 --> 01:01:24,090
Set, go!

1071
01:01:26,330 --> 01:01:27,620
[The first place winner...]

1072
01:01:27,620 --> 01:01:29,160
[is going to be me!]

1073
01:01:33,170 --> 01:01:35,870
[Mr. Capable is first to get to the ball.]

1074
01:01:35,870 --> 01:01:38,030
[And everyone crowds around him.]

1075
01:01:40,410 --> 01:01:43,200
[He breaks through that mob
and gets up on his feet?]

1076
01:01:43,890 --> 01:01:46,260
[Yoo Hyuk is knocked down with
one swipe of his hand!]

1077
01:01:49,220 --> 01:01:50,790
[Break free!]

1078
01:01:52,430 --> 01:01:54,820
[Faking from left to right
just like a rugby match!]

1079
01:01:59,980 --> 01:02:02,400
[Huh? Where is he going?]

1080
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:04,970
[Rule: Must pull out the flag!]

1081
01:02:06,850 --> 01:02:10,430
[Mr. Capable's energy on full force!]

1082
01:02:10,980 --> 01:02:12,960
[If we don't stop him, then we'll lose!]

1083
01:02:13,700 --> 01:02:16,510
[Mr. Capable on full power!]

1084
01:02:20,330 --> 01:02:24,660
[Mr. Capable,
Running Man's tower of strength!]

1085
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:27,630
[A man who's strength can't be matched...]

1086
01:02:27,630 --> 01:02:32,480
[Will he be able to claim his throne
as first place on Running Man team?]

1087
01:02:35,500 --> 01:02:38,030
[He's unstoppable even with the
strength of all six members combined!]

1088
01:02:43,720 --> 01:02:46,060
[He has the flag!]

1089

[Kim Jong Kook solidifies his position
in first place!]

1090

[The ball is all crumpled in his hand.]

1091
01:02:53,460 --> 01:02:54,930
Give me some water!

1092
01:02:56,260 --> 01:03:00,260
[Kwang-retriever switching over his
loyalty to the new king of the throne.]

1093
01:03:00,260 --> 01:03:01,600
Here, I'll get you some water.

1094
01:03:01,600 --> 01:03:03,040
Are you okay?

1095
01:03:03,800 --> 01:03:06,160
I knew it!
Jong Kook is the winner!

1096
01:03:07,980 --> 01:03:12,850
[Everyone bowing down in front of
the new wielder of power.]

1097
01:03:12,850 --> 01:03:14,380
Wow, you did so great.

[This is how Running Man members survive.]

1099
01:03:18,640 --> 01:03:19,670
That's good.

1100
01:03:19,670 --> 01:03:23,000
Kim Jong Kook came in first
during the first round of this mission.

1101

[There's still a chance to avoid
getting back in the steaming car!]

1102
01:03:26,590 --> 01:03:28,080
I can't get back in that car!

1103
01:03:28,080 --> 01:03:29,380
The first three spots.

1104
01:03:29,380 --> 01:03:32,920
Kim Jong Kook can now lie in his chaise
and rest in comfort.

1105
01:03:32,920 --> 01:03:34,840
How am I supposed to rest in comfort
in this state?

1106
01:03:35,540 --> 01:03:37,710
[Looks like you're resting
comfortable enough.]

1107

- Why did you lose the ball?
- I can't believe you lost the ball.

1112
01:03:54,420 --> 01:03:57,350
[You guys lost the ball too!]

1113
01:03:58,290 --> 01:03:59,910
- Gary!
- Yes!

1114

[Kkuk and Gary both moving up a spot
in their rank.]

1115

It's nice to meet you again like this.

1116
01:04:08,670 --> 01:04:10,870
There's even a fan over here.

1117
01:04:11,560 --> 01:04:13,970

over here.

[Second place winner even gets an umbrella
to protect himself against the hot sun.]

1119

You two have no idea how good
you have it right now.

1120
01:04:20,590 --> 01:04:22,560
You two are so lucky not to have to
ride in that car.

1121
01:04:26,380 --> 01:04:29,220
[It's useless to give him nice things...]

1122
01:04:29,830 --> 01:04:31,360
This is like pure hell.

bloodier than it ever has been!]

Everyone...

01:04:55,380 --> 01:04:58,320
Why are you battling like your life
depends on it?

1129
01:04:58,320 --> 01:05:00,180
Have you forgotten who's in
first place right now?

1130
01:05:00,180 --> 01:05:04,010
- It's Mr. Kim Jong Kook!
- Who do you think will get swapped out?

1131
01:05:04,010 --> 01:05:06,450
- Of course.
- I understand.

1132
01:05:06,460 --> 01:05:07,740

Kim Jong Kook is in first place.]

Lee Kwang Soo, are you not going to take
your place in the third place spot?

1139
01:05:29,110 --> 01:05:31,910
I'll go once I feed
my master some water first.

swap places around for lower level people.]

- I worked hard so that I could do this.

1142
01:05:38,260 --> 01:05:39,930
No, it's okay.

1143
01:05:41,210 --> 01:05:43,510

- No, I didn't!

[Kwang-retriever's desperate attempt
to stay alive in the race.]

energy he has left in him!]

entertaining battle from all of you!

1154

too rough with a lady in the game?

- Do you have to go this far?
- I do have to go this far!

1161
01:07:05,240 --> 01:07:07,430
You two are getting too touchy feely!

1162
01:07:08,920 --> 01:07:11,000
- You're going too far!
- You two are getting too physical!

1163
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:12,810
I can't ride in that car anymore, Ji Hyo.

1164
01:07:13,390 --> 01:07:15,010
I can't ride in that car anymore.

1165
01:07:15,010 --> 01:07:16,870
Do something!

1166
01:07:16,870 --> 01:07:18,050
[What? Big-nose Brother takes it?]

1167
01:07:18,050 --> 01:07:19,650

[Picking up the flag pieces, and the ball...
and Blank Ji wins!]

1169
01:07:29,260 --> 01:07:31,020
Wow, that's a fierce battle.

1170
01:07:32,040 --> 01:07:34,760
This is the final battle.

1171
01:07:35,390 --> 01:07:37,290
- Everyone...
- Yes?

1172
01:07:37,290 --> 01:07:40,750
The person that comes in last
during this round...

1173
01:07:40,750 --> 01:07:45,570
we don't know yet whether he'll be in
last place or the third place yet.

1174
01:07:45,570 --> 01:07:47,110
- Yes, I understand.
- We'll work very hard!

1175
01:07:47,110 --> 01:07:51,240
- Yes, I understand!
- Don't think of it as your last chance.

1176
01:07:52,890 --> 01:07:56,770
[The final battle of this mission- Go!]

1177
01:07:59,040 --> 01:08:02,490
Even if you lose this battle,
you could be entitled to a bonus!

1178
01:08:02,490 --> 01:08:05,730
- Yes!
- It depends on how well you play the game.

1179

more entertaining for the viewers.]

[How is it that the two oldest
members of the team...]

1181
01:08:17,380 --> 01:08:19,770
No.
No, I can't get back in that car.

1182
01:08:20,380 --> 01:08:21,990
You're going to have to get back
in that car anyway.

1183

[The only way to avoid getting back in
that car is to earn that man's favor...]

1188
01:08:39,800 --> 01:08:42,150
[Does this look like an act?]

1189
01:08:42,150 --> 01:08:43,860
You're flailing your arm out towards
the flag! There you go!

1190
01:08:43,870 --> 01:08:45,280
Reach for the flag!
There you go!

[It's now time for the first place winner
to wield his power over ranking.]

1195

- Right here.
- Yes, I want to ride in that car.

1196
01:09:04,470 --> 01:09:05,750
Me!

1197
01:09:06,530 --> 01:09:08,470
- Please, Sir...
- I'd be grateful, Sir.

1198

our fans really seem to love that.

1199
01:09:15,900 --> 01:09:19,040
I would like for Lee Kwang Soo and
Song Ji Hyo to swap out their spots.

1200
01:09:19,040 --> 01:09:21,850
[Third place Lee Kwang Soo to swap
with Fifth place, Song Ji Hyo.]

1201

- Thank you.
- Sure.

1202
01:09:23,270 --> 01:09:27,660
- Thank you.
- You're being so compliant and polite today.

1203
01:09:30,070 --> 01:09:32,460
- Come down here.
- Coming in at third place has no meaning.

1204
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:36,080
- Coming in at third doesn't matter.
- Fine, let's do this.

I'm going to put my life on the line
to come in at top three.

1207
01:09:43,700 --> 01:09:48,220
- You already did that the last round.
- You're right. What does that even matter?

1208
01:09:48,410 --> 01:09:51,300
I really hate how this feels to have to
come back down after being at the top.

1209
01:09:51,300 --> 01:09:52,390
Yeah, it sucks.

1210
01:09:52,420 --> 01:09:54,800

the staff car, who's their guide back.]

1214

- You can't go too fast in this.
- I can see the steam rising.

1215
01:10:05,370 --> 01:10:08,430
This isn't a car we're riding in.
It's basically a desert.

1216
01:10:08,430 --> 01:10:10,350
- I wore this long sleeved top on purpose.
- Why?

1217
01:10:10,350 --> 01:10:12,670
- Because the sun's burning my arm.
- I know.

1218

no matter what I had to do.

1219

your own questions.

I come up with?

- What is it?
- In the early 70's...

What is he doing?

1276
01:14:22,680 --> 01:14:25,790
- What kind of a question is that?
- This is my question.

1277
01:14:27,810 --> 01:14:31,490
- What year were you born in, Kwang Soo?
- I was born in '65.

1278
01:14:31,530 --> 01:14:33,730
You were born in '85, right?
I'll keep that in mind.

1279

amongst the children back in the early 70s.

- Yes, we know.
- It was called, 'The Ghost Man'.

[A cartoon where a family of ghosts
were the main characters of the show.]

1283

With it being a horror cartoon theme,
this show traumatized many kids...

1284
01:14:57,220 --> 01:14:59,530
- Maybe that's not the right word.
- What do you mean, traumatized?

1285
01:14:59,530 --> 01:15:00,950
Were you traumatized by the show then?

1286
01:15:00,950 --> 01:15:04,220
What do you mean?
That cartoon didn't traumatize any kids.

1287
01:15:04,220 --> 01:15:10,090

three main characters from that show.

to this question, right?

I'll accept the answer if you can correctly
come up with two out of the three names.

doesn't know the answer.]

- Yes.

- Did you think that they were scary looking?
- Yes, I just remembered what they look like.

the wrong answer?]

[Gary, Gil, Leessang.]

1317
01:16:40,720 --> 01:16:43,090
[Gary- wrong answer!]

1318
01:16:48,710 --> 01:16:50,670
[A ride on the banana boat for
getting the wrong answer!]

1319
01:16:57,730 --> 01:16:59,890
- I had no idea what the answer was.
- That was really hard.

1320
01:16:59,890 --> 01:17:01,820
[This is now Suk Jin's new seat.]

1321
01:17:01,820 --> 01:17:04,040
I knew the right answer.

1322
01:17:04,340 --> 01:17:05,830
Why did it have to be me!

1323
01:17:07,310 --> 01:17:08,980
Life can be changed in one
single moment!

1324
01:17:08,980 --> 01:17:12,630
[Second place, Gary is swapped out with
seventh place, Suk Jin.]

1325
01:17:13,380 --> 01:17:16,440
[Yoo Hyuk is currently seated
in the first place throne.]

1326
01:17:16,440 --> 01:17:18,520
- This question... is about nature.
- Wow... nature?

1327
01:17:18,780 --> 01:17:20,140
Giraffes are...

1328
01:17:20,910 --> 01:17:24,180
known for having the highest, what?

1329
01:17:24,840 --> 01:17:28,140
What is the highest thing that they're known
to have because of their long necks?

1330
01:17:28,140 --> 01:17:31,200
- Giraffes has the highest, what?
- The highest thing that they're known for?

1331
01:17:31,200 --> 01:17:32,910
Isn't that too easy of a question?

1332
01:17:32,910 --> 01:17:35,590
[Giraffes are known for having the
highest 'what' because of their long necks?]

1333
01:17:35,850 --> 01:17:39,340
[The correct answer is... 'blood pressure'.]

1334
01:17:39,340 --> 01:17:43,500
[They're known to have the highest blood
pressure to get the blood up their long necks.]

1335
01:17:43,500 --> 01:17:44,790
It's high, you say?

1336
01:17:45,190 --> 01:17:46,980
How many letters in the answer?

1337
01:17:46,980 --> 01:17:48,510
Less than three.

1338
01:17:49,870 --> 01:17:52,050
- Yes!
- I know the right answer.

1339
01:17:52,050 --> 01:17:53,710
I know what the two letter answer is.

1340
01:17:53,710 --> 01:17:55,150
I got the right answer.

1341
01:17:55,160 --> 01:17:56,600
This must be it.

1342
01:17:56,960 --> 01:17:58,740
I feel bad for Kwang Soo.

1343
01:17:59,660 --> 01:18:00,760
I feel like everyone knows the answer.

1344
01:18:00,760 --> 01:18:02,480
How many characters in those two letters?

1345
01:18:02,830 --> 01:18:04,350
The two letters both have
three characters.

1346
01:18:04,350 --> 01:18:06,550
[Hm...]

1347
01:18:08,520 --> 01:18:10,490
- I already know the answer to this.
- Suk Jin.

1348
01:18:10,490 --> 01:18:12,900
- Yes.
- In those two letters...

1349
01:18:13,440 --> 01:18:15,170
is 'P' a part of the character used or not?

1350
01:18:15,170 --> 01:18:16,590
No, it's not used.

1351
01:18:17,170 --> 01:18:18,910
[Uh oh...]

1352
01:18:18,910 --> 01:18:20,780
What about 'S'?

1353
01:18:20,780 --> 01:18:22,850
- It's used.
- Come out here, Song Ji Hyo!

1354
01:18:28,260 --> 01:18:30,470
Lee Kwang Soo,
please reveal your answer.

1355
01:18:30,480 --> 01:18:35,440
[Lee Kwang Soo's correct answer-
Blood pressure.]

1356
01:18:35,440 --> 01:18:37,450
Song Ji Hyo, your answer?

1357
01:18:37,450 --> 01:18:43,420
[What did Ji Hyo come up with
as her answer?]

1358
01:18:44,810 --> 01:18:47,650
[Blood pressure- Correct!]

1359
01:18:48,220 --> 01:18:49,790
What?
Me?

1360
01:18:54,590 --> 01:18:57,130
[Challenger Kwang Soo is off
on his boat ride!]

1361
01:18:57,960 --> 01:19:00,950
[Ace Ji Hyo having pretended not to
know the answer even when she knew!]

1362
01:19:03,970 --> 01:19:06,600
[A forceful plunge into the water!]

1363
01:19:07,220 --> 01:19:09,730
- Ji Hyo knew the answer!
- Ji Hyo knew!

1364
01:19:09,730 --> 01:19:12,630
- I didn't think Ji Hyo knew.
- Ji Hyo was faking!

1365
01:19:12,630 --> 01:19:14,270
Yeah, she faked it.

1366
01:19:14,270 --> 01:19:18,080
[Time to tally up all the gold coins
that they've gained so far.]

1367
01:19:18,080 --> 01:19:19,320
I have 11.

1368
01:19:19,320 --> 01:19:21,030
- Why does Gary have so many?
- Gary has a lot.

1369
01:19:21,030 --> 01:19:22,950
- I have 14.
- Wow!

1370
01:19:23,350 --> 01:19:25,180
- I have nine.
- Nine.

1371
01:19:25,180 --> 01:19:26,690
I have 14.

1372
01:19:26,690 --> 01:19:28,250
I have 14, too.

1373
01:19:28,250 --> 01:19:29,780
I have eight.

1374
01:19:30,160 --> 01:19:33,310
- How does he have eight?
- How did you get that many?

1375
01:19:33,310 --> 01:19:34,610
[His count sounds a little fishy...]

1376
01:19:34,610 --> 01:19:37,600
We will now determine the final
ranking of your positions.

1377
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:40,200
[Using the number of coins to determine
the final ranking of their positions.]

1378
01:19:40,200 --> 01:19:42,240
The four of you with the 14 coins,
please step over to the side.

1379
01:19:42,240 --> 01:19:44,460
[A total of four people with 14 coins!]

1380
01:19:44,460 --> 01:19:48,760
[The four people who've worked hard all day
are feeling excited about their standing!]

1381
01:19:48,760 --> 01:19:50,440
Am I still in last place even with
these two that I stole away?

1382
01:19:51,940 --> 01:19:55,000
In the order of your win from the last round,
Song Ji Hyo is in the top spot.

1383
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:56,730
Then am I in second place?

1384
01:19:56,730 --> 01:20:00,630
Then Kang Gary, Ha Ha, and
Kim Jong Kook.

1385
01:20:00,920 --> 01:20:07,160
[Ji Hyo, Gary, Ha Ha, Jong Kook,
Jae Suk, Suk Jin, and Kwang Soo.]

1386
01:20:07,170 --> 01:20:09,980
- What the heck!
- I can't believe I'm in first place.

1387
01:20:09,980 --> 01:20:12,510
- Give me your third place badge.
- You never know what could happen in life.

1388
01:20:13,820 --> 01:20:14,920
What the heck is this?

1389
01:20:14,920 --> 01:20:16,580
- Then I'm in fifth place?
- Who gets my fourth place badge?

1390
01:20:16,580 --> 01:20:19,210
So if I hadn't taken this from Gary's bag,
he would've come in at first place?

1391
01:20:19,210 --> 01:20:21,080
What?
You stole my coins?

1392
01:20:22,410 --> 01:20:26,100
[Traitorous Giraffe having stolen two coins
from Gary's bag when he wasn't looking.]

1393
01:20:26,100 --> 01:20:28,430
We were told to keep it safe,
but Gary left his bag next to me.

1394
01:20:28,430 --> 01:20:32,580
Starting with the first place winner...
Do you see the treasure ship behind you?

1395
01:20:34,630 --> 01:20:36,990
[Treasure ship?]

1396
01:20:36,990 --> 01:20:38,930
Look!
It's a pirate ship!

1397
01:20:39,280 --> 01:20:41,230
Wow, that is a pirate ship!

1398
01:20:41,230 --> 01:20:44,260
[Something... is coming
into their view on the water!]

1399
01:20:46,340 --> 01:20:51,090
[A black ship gliding towards them
on top of the water...]

1400
01:20:54,250 --> 01:20:59,380
[Just what is the identity of this ship
that appeared suddenly out of nowhere?]

1401
01:21:00,520 --> 01:21:02,360
- What is that?
- Is that really a pirate ship?

1402
01:21:03,070 --> 01:21:05,050
- That's our ship.
- Really?

1403
01:21:05,050 --> 01:21:06,320
The Black Pearl?

1404
01:21:06,320 --> 01:21:08,080
- Oh my goodness.
- That's your ship?

1405
01:21:10,080 --> 01:21:15,240
[The mysterious black ship...
What is the secret that it carries?]

1406
01:21:18,990 --> 01:21:21,610
[Starting with first place winner...]

1407
01:21:21,610 --> 01:21:25,880
[Everyone will have a chance to board the
ship and increase the amount of their gold!]

1408
01:21:25,880 --> 01:21:28,120
- Wow, what is this?
- This is so cool.

1409
01:21:28,130 --> 01:21:31,080
- Then can we lose it too?
- You'll find out once you're on-board.

1410
01:21:31,560 --> 01:21:33,990
- Then I'll go first.
- We have to go on-board to find out?

1411
01:21:33,990 --> 01:21:35,230
Good luck, Miss Blank.

1412
01:21:35,230 --> 01:21:36,830
[Ji Hyo is the first to head off
towards the black ship.]

1413
01:21:36,830 --> 01:21:38,120
Okay, good luck.

1414
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:42,610
[Just what awaits them on that boat?]

1415
01:21:46,370 --> 01:21:48,350
You don't think that they'll kidnap
Ji Hyo, do you?

1416
01:21:48,920 --> 01:21:50,590
[Nervous...]

1417
01:21:52,730 --> 01:21:57,230
[Ji Hyo is getting closer and closer
towards the black ship...]

1418
01:21:57,230 --> 01:21:59,030
Wow!

1419
01:22:12,860 --> 01:22:14,200
It's so dark in here.

1420
01:22:15,810 --> 01:22:17,190
What is this?

1421
01:22:18,540 --> 01:22:21,360
- Second place holder may get going.
- Okay.

1422
01:22:30,250 --> 01:22:32,580
Wait... you're pirates!

1423
01:22:32,580 --> 01:22:34,230
Why are you doing this to me?

1424
01:22:35,380 --> 01:22:38,000
[Taking the pouch full of her gold
away from her!]

1425
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:39,220
That's my gold!

1426
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:47,330
I worked so hard to earn that gold!

1427
01:22:49,240 --> 01:22:53,510
All of the other members are heading
here without knowing what awaits them...

1428
01:22:54,500 --> 01:22:56,120
Why is it so dark in here?
What's going on in here?

1429
01:22:56,120 --> 01:22:57,380
What is this?

1430
01:22:58,590 --> 01:22:59,860
What the heck?

1431
01:23:06,490 --> 01:23:07,740
That's my gold!

1432
01:23:07,740 --> 01:23:10,820
[Gary has his 14 pieces of gold
taken away from him as well.]

1433
01:23:15,050 --> 01:23:16,500
What is this?

1434
01:23:17,250 --> 01:23:19,760
I don't know either.
They took my gold away from me too.

1435
01:23:20,990 --> 01:23:23,800
[Everyone who boards the ship is
taken hostage by the pirates!]

1436
01:23:23,800 --> 01:23:26,350
I thought we were going to get the
chance to earn more gold!

1437
01:23:38,490 --> 01:23:42,020
[The pirates are taking all their gold away!]

1438
01:23:42,610 --> 01:23:44,400
This is a pirate ship.

1439
01:23:53,390 --> 01:23:54,680
No!

1440
01:23:55,020 --> 01:23:57,870
[That's what you think.]

1441
01:23:59,570 --> 01:24:02,920
[All of Running Man's gold is
taken away from them!]

1442
01:24:02,920 --> 01:24:04,010
What is this?

1443
01:24:04,010 --> 01:24:06,860
- What's going on? Where are we going?
- What's happening to us?

1444
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:10,290
[The ship... is moving?]

1445
01:24:10,670 --> 01:24:13,010
Please!
Please let us go!

1446
01:24:20,720 --> 01:24:23,980
[The next morning...]

1447
01:24:25,260 --> 01:24:30,120
[The mysterious pirate ship
full of their stolen gold.]

1448
01:24:34,770 --> 01:24:40,260
[The occupants of that boat have
been on that boat the whole time...]

1449
01:24:42,210 --> 01:24:48,040
[The pirate ship sailing the ocean
once again in search for more gold.]

1450

[The hostages being taken against their will
after having their gold taken from them.]

1451
01:25:00,360 --> 01:25:01,710
We don't have any money.

1452
01:25:01,710 --> 01:25:04,350
You've already taken
all of our money away from us.

1453
01:25:04,890 --> 01:25:09,450
[It's time to meet the owner of this ship.]

1454
01:25:09,870 --> 01:25:11,880
- Get up there.
- We have no money.

1455
01:25:13,920 --> 01:25:16,010
Let the first three...
I mean first place spots live.

1456
01:25:18,300 --> 01:25:21,150
[Welcome, Running Man!]

1457

[The owners of this ship-
Top Idol Group in Korea, Shinhwa!]

Hurry up and get up here!

1466
01:25:54,100 --> 01:25:56,430
- Are you seriously going to be like this?
- What are you guys doing?

1467
01:25:56,430 --> 01:25:58,600
[A scary atmosphere?]

1468

Wow!
It's Shinhwa!

1469
01:26:01,290 --> 01:26:02,910
Hello!

1470
01:26:03,870 --> 01:26:05,300
We're pirates!

1471
01:26:05,300 --> 01:26:07,220
No, you're Shinhwa.
What are you talking about?

1472
01:26:08,110 --> 01:26:10,490
We are... pirates!

1473
01:26:11,710 --> 01:26:13,890
[Look at these guys...]

1474
01:26:15,190 --> 01:26:17,200
Don't you recognize me, Eric?

1475
01:26:17,630 --> 01:26:20,090
We are... pirates!

1476
01:26:20,090 --> 01:26:22,340
- Look at these guys.
- Where's the other guy?

1477
01:26:22,340 --> 01:26:24,200
Where's Dong Wan?

1478
01:26:24,200 --> 01:26:26,710
We dunked him in the ocean.

1479
01:26:28,760 --> 01:26:31,530
[It's a good thing that they're
nice pirates.]

1480
01:26:33,220 --> 01:26:35,350
Why did you take our gold away from us?

1481
01:26:35,350 --> 01:26:38,060
- Your gold is now in our possession.
- Where did you guys put it?

1482
01:26:40,060 --> 01:26:41,250
Right here.

1483
01:26:42,480 --> 01:26:43,830
- You want me to open it for you?
- Why can't you open it?

1484
01:26:44,980 --> 01:26:47,360
[For a pirate, his strength is a bit...]

1485
01:26:47,360 --> 01:26:49,360
- Can you open this for me?
- Say 'please'.

1486
01:26:49,360 --> 01:26:51,810
What kind of a pirate are you?

1487
01:26:55,310 --> 01:26:57,260
[What?]

1488
01:26:58,360 --> 01:27:01,980
[What happened to yesterday's gold?]

1489
01:27:08,780 --> 01:27:14,880
[The curse in the movie,
'Pirates of the Caribbean'...]

1490
01:27:20,030 --> 01:27:23,930
[All their gold has turned into scrap metal!]

1491
01:27:28,910 --> 01:27:30,410
There was gold in there last night.

1492
01:27:32,770 --> 01:27:34,970
[A letter inside the chest?]

1493
01:27:34,970 --> 01:27:36,220
There's a letter.

1494
01:27:36,580 --> 01:27:38,130
[There you go.]

1495
01:27:38,130 --> 01:27:41,160
- Give it to Ji Hyo to read.
- You shouldn't have given that to them.

1496
01:27:41,160 --> 01:27:43,390
We have to stay in charge here.

1497
01:27:45,860 --> 01:27:47,900
The curse of the tides.

1498
01:27:47,900 --> 01:27:50,770
- Is it the tidal shores again?
- The curse of the tides?

1499
01:27:50,770 --> 01:27:52,990
<i>Your treasure has been cursed.</i>

1500
01:27:52,990 --> 01:27:56,070
<i>Through a series of competitions,
you will be given hints to lift the curse.</i>

1501
01:27:57,030 --> 01:28:01,720
<i>The winning team will be given a useful clue,
and the losing team, an ambiguous one.</i>

1502
01:28:02,060 --> 01:28:07,100
<i>The first team to gather up all the hints to
lift the curse will take all of the treasure.</i>

1503
01:28:07,480 --> 01:28:08,760
No!

1504
01:28:08,760 --> 01:28:10,100
That enough.
Give it a rest.

1505
01:28:12,500 --> 01:28:15,000
- We have to find our treasure.
- What is the matter with you?

1506
01:28:15,220 --> 01:28:18,670
So we have to compete against each other
to take over the treasure?

1507
01:28:18,670 --> 01:28:21,420
But there are only five members on
the Shinhwa Team, so what do we do?

1508
01:28:21,430 --> 01:28:23,610
- I know.
- Then I'll join this team.

1509
01:28:24,620 --> 01:28:26,950
- I think five of them would be plenty.
- Why are you saying that?

1510
01:28:26,950 --> 01:28:29,890
That is true though.
The way I see it, these guys...

1511
01:28:29,890 --> 01:28:33,370
- These guys are really competitive.
- We love competition.

1512
01:28:33,370 --> 01:28:36,140
Seriously though,
it's not just that they're competitive

1513
01:28:36,140 --> 01:28:40,220
but even when we they did that bungee jump,
they were all so fearless about it.

1514
01:28:40,220 --> 01:28:42,430
[Fierce competitors who know
no fear when it comes to competing.]

1515
01:28:42,430 --> 01:28:46,410
- Hye Sung and Andy over here...
- He's like a superman.

1516
01:28:46,410 --> 01:28:48,310
Andy's super athletic.

1517
01:28:48,310 --> 01:28:52,670
- They're all too good.
- I normally wouldn't say this...

1518
01:28:52,670 --> 01:28:54,680
but these guys are just fine
to compete against the seven of us.

1519
01:28:54,690 --> 01:28:57,830
If anything, it's better that Dong Wan
isn't with you guys today.

1520
01:28:57,830 --> 01:28:59,450
He's like a sink hole amongst us.

1521
01:28:59,450 --> 01:29:01,370
Isn't he really strong though?

1522
01:29:02,570 --> 01:29:04,350
Let's just do the race the way
we're grouped right now?

1523
01:29:04,350 --> 01:29:06,150
- No, I don't know.
- Can we do that?

1524
01:29:06,150 --> 01:29:08,350
I think this setup is just fine if
we're going to compete with Shinhwa.

1525
01:29:08,360 --> 01:29:10,900
I can smell the blood in the air today.

1526
01:29:12,920 --> 01:29:15,140
But Eric really suits his character today.

1527
01:29:15,140 --> 01:29:18,670
[Eric looks as though he can be included
in the cast of a pirate movie.]

1528
01:29:18,670 --> 01:29:20,570
- You can be in a pirate movie.
- Yeah, you look like you'd fit perfectly.

1529
01:29:20,570 --> 01:29:22,240
You look really handsome.

1530
01:29:23,880 --> 01:29:25,980
- He's always been good looking.
- He's always been handsome.

1531
01:29:25,980 --> 01:29:27,860
But he wasn't this good looking in the past.

1532
01:29:30,240 --> 01:29:32,770
He looks like he's gotten even
better looking.

1533
01:29:37,440 --> 01:29:39,070
Okay, we lost.

1534
01:29:40,130 --> 01:29:44,890
[Off they go to lift
the curse off of their treasure!]

1535
01:29:47,760 --> 01:29:48,980
There it is!

1536
01:29:49,830 --> 01:29:55,000
[Appearing in front of their eyes...]

1537
01:29:55,010 --> 01:29:59,200
[is a scene of wild, natural beauty!]

1538
01:30:01,110 --> 01:30:04,970
[A grassy sandbank in the middle of the ocean
acting as the ocean's own desert!]

1539
01:30:06,150 --> 01:30:15,650
[Mystical sandy island that shows
the grandeur and beauty twice a day!]

1540
01:30:16,510 --> 01:30:19,500
[Running Man and Shinhwa touches shore.]

1541
01:30:19,500 --> 01:30:21,430
- This is like a work of art.
- I can't believe a place like this exists.

1542
01:30:21,430 --> 01:30:23,400
So this is underwater part of the day?

1543
01:30:25,800 --> 01:30:27,700
You didn't make this island
just for the show, did you?

1544
01:30:29,710 --> 01:30:34,240
[The first leg of their journey to lift
the curse off of their treasure!]

1545
01:30:35,970 --> 01:30:42,390
[Just who will get their hands
on the real treasure?]

1546
