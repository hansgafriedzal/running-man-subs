1
00:00:01,074 --> 00:00:03,835
[Brutal battle within the family.]

2
00:00:03,836 --> 00:00:06,534
[The gold bars that they
worked so hard to earn.]

3
00:00:06,535 --> 00:00:09,363
[But...]

4
00:00:09,364 --> 00:00:12,477
[They were told that they would be given
the chance to earn more gold.]

5
00:00:12,478 --> 00:00:15,061
[Mysterious kidnapping.]

6
00:00:15,062 --> 00:00:19,590
[Where did all the gold that they worked
so hard to earn disappear off to?]

7
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:27,070
[An unidentified pirate ship above the sea.]

8
00:00:28,658 --> 00:00:33,522
[As they stepped on the sea deck
the following morning...]

9
00:00:33,523 --> 00:00:35,983
You already took away all
our gold yesterday.

10
00:00:36,656 --> 00:00:41,126
[A suspicious band of people were
waiting for them on the deck...]

11
00:00:41,127 --> 00:00:42,779
- Get up there.
- We have no money.

12
00:00:43,481 --> 00:00:46,232
Can you let the people in the
top three rank go free?

13
00:00:47,447 --> 00:00:50,505
[The identity of these people that have
taken Running Man members as hostages?]

14
00:00:50,506 --> 00:00:51,970
[They are none other than...]

15
00:00:51,971 --> 00:00:55,740
[Pirates of the Western Sea, Shinhwa.]

16
00:00:56,428 --> 00:01:07,904
[No strangers to the variety world-
They make their return as pirates!]

17
00:01:10,805 --> 00:01:14,054
- Hurry up and get up here!
- Are you seriously going to do this to us?

18
00:01:14,055 --> 00:01:18,492
[Instead of a face-off with the pirates,
it feels more like a reunion of friends.]

19
00:01:19,893 --> 00:01:21,262
Hello!

20
00:01:21,263 --> 00:01:23,344
- Hello!
- We are the pirates!

21
00:01:23,345 --> 00:01:25,656
No, you're not. You guys are Shinhwa.
What are you talking about?

22
00:01:26,195 --> 00:01:28,940
We are... pirates!

23
00:01:29,436 --> 00:01:31,655
[What a joke.]

24
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:35,563
Are you really going to do
this to me, Eric?

25
00:01:36,177 --> 00:01:38,550
We are... pirates!

26
00:01:38,551 --> 00:01:40,757
- What are you guys doing?
- Where's the other guy?

27
00:01:40,758 --> 00:01:42,501
- Where's Dong Wan?
- Where did Dong Wan go?

28
00:01:42,915 --> 00:01:45,863
- We dumped him in the ocean.
- How can you be pirates without Dong Wan?

29
00:01:45,864 --> 00:01:50,287
- Why did you take our gold?
- Why would you guys take our gold?

30
00:01:50,288 --> 00:01:52,058
- Where is it?
- We have it.

31
00:01:52,058 --> 00:01:53,319
- Where is it?
- We have the gold.

32
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:57,207
- We have it right here.
- We worked hard to get the gold.

33
00:01:57,208 --> 00:01:59,844
- You want me to open it for you?
- Why can't you open it?

34
00:02:00,627 --> 00:02:02,744
- Why can't you open it?
- Can you open it for me?

35
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:06,776
- Say, 'Can you open it for me, please'.
- What kind of a pirate are you?

36
00:02:06,777 --> 00:02:09,113
- Let's open it on the count of three.
- One, two, three.

37
00:02:09,802 --> 00:02:11,115
[All the gold bars that were
taken away from them...]

38
00:02:11,116 --> 00:02:14,086
[What?]

39
00:02:19,734 --> 00:02:23,241
[All of the gold bars transformed
into scrap metal?]

40
00:02:24,677 --> 00:02:27,885
[All of those gold bars...]

41
00:02:27,886 --> 00:02:32,342
[have been cursed out here
in the Western Sea...]

42
00:02:32,343 --> 00:02:36,751
[and transformed into scrap metal.]

43
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:40,706
- What is this?
- What happened?

44
00:02:41,938 --> 00:02:44,544
There was gold in there just
a little while ago.

45
00:02:44,979 --> 00:02:47,873
- What happened?
- Someone took our gold.

46
00:02:47,874 --> 00:02:49,435
There's a letter in here.

47
00:02:49,436 --> 00:02:50,775
Can you read it for us?

48
00:02:52,155 --> 00:02:54,688
[Instead of taking the lead,
the pirates are being led.]

49
00:02:55,384 --> 00:02:57,288
We have to take the lead here.

50
00:02:57,289 --> 00:02:58,807
If anything,
they're taking the lead here.

51
00:02:58,934 --> 00:03:01,057
The curse of the tides.

52
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:03,827
<i>- The tides again?
- Your treasure...</i>

53
00:03:03,862 --> 00:03:06,339
<i>Your treasure has been cursed.</i>

54
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:09,389
<i>You will be given hints to lift the curse,
and to regain your treasure.</i>

55
00:03:09,629 --> 00:03:14,999
<i>Winning team will be given a useful hint,
and the losing team an ambiguous one.</i>

56
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:20,584
<i>The first team to gather all the hints to
lift the curse will get to keep the treasure.</i>

57
00:03:20,585 --> 00:03:22,191
No!

58
00:03:22,192 --> 00:03:23,556
Just give it a rest.

59
00:03:23,767 --> 00:03:27,058
- Stop with that 'no'.
- What are you going to do about it then?

60
00:03:27,605 --> 00:03:29,807
I'm tired of hearing you say that.

61
00:03:29,808 --> 00:03:31,962
But there are only five of them on
Shinhwa's team, so what are we going to do?

62
00:03:31,963 --> 00:03:34,195
- I know.
- I think five of them is more than enough.

63
00:03:34,196 --> 00:03:35,869
- Why are you saying that?
- Actually, that's true.

64
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:38,034
I normally wouldn't say this,
but these guys...

65
00:03:38,035 --> 00:03:41,542
- These guys are pretty competitive.
- We really like competition.

66
00:03:41,979 --> 00:03:43,067
Seriously.

67
00:03:43,849 --> 00:03:46,969
[Pirate Shinhwa's invasion on Running Man.]

68
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:48,535
They're practically flying around here.

69
00:03:48,536 --> 00:03:52,565
[Just like the olden days,
their skills are still as sharp as ever.]

70
00:03:54,455 --> 00:03:59,008
[Shinhwa- We have returned!]

71
00:03:59,539 --> 00:04:02,737
But the problem is...
these guys are way too good.

72
00:04:02,738 --> 00:04:05,744
- I know.
- But we're older too now.

73
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:07,836
[Even though they're the legendary Shinhwa,
with the passing of years...]

74
00:04:07,836 --> 00:04:11,122
[The average age for
Shinhwa members are 34.3 years old.]

75
00:04:11,123 --> 00:04:12,534
- Seriously?
- Yes.

76
00:04:12,535 --> 00:04:14,204
When did you guys get so old?

77
00:04:14,656 --> 00:04:16,126
- But you're older than us.
- We're still not as old as you are.

78
00:04:16,127 --> 00:04:18,134
How old do you think we are?

79
00:04:20,121 --> 00:04:21,943
Our average age is way too high.

80
00:04:21,944 --> 00:04:24,258
You have no idea how strong
they are, do you?

81
00:04:24,259 --> 00:04:26,753
- These guys used to be like machines.
- Machines?

82
00:04:26,754 --> 00:04:29,351
[Their younger days when their skills were
comparable to that of a machine.]

83
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:30,990
Whenever these guys would play a game

84
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,637
it would be a given to eliminate all
the members of the opposing teams

85
00:04:33,638 --> 00:04:37,443
and they would just start to
compete amongst themselves.

86
00:04:38,004 --> 00:04:40,641
But Andy looks like
I may be able to handle him.

87
00:04:40,978 --> 00:04:44,741
[Unfounded sense of confidence
towards Andy.]

88
00:04:44,742 --> 00:04:47,602
- I think I can handle Andy.
- Don't anger Andy, Suk Jin.

89
00:04:48,434 --> 00:04:50,712
- Seriously?
- You really have no idea.

90
00:04:50,713 --> 00:04:52,865
If anything else,
Eric is our weakest player.

91
00:04:52,866 --> 00:04:55,286
[Eric is the designated
weak player of Shinhwa?]

92
00:04:55,287 --> 00:04:57,089
I'm feeling really seasick right now.

93
00:05:00,012 --> 00:05:04,269
What is it, Kwang Soo?
Are you looking at Eric as your rival?

94
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:07,216
I think I can take him on.

95
00:05:09,629 --> 00:05:10,879
There it is.

96
00:05:14,232 --> 00:05:17,245
[A mysterious island of sand
in the middle of the ocean.]

97
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:25,343
[Island of sand that only appears
when the tide is low.]

98
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:30,479
This place is like a piece of art.

99
00:05:30,963 --> 00:05:34,160
- I can't believe a place like this exists.
- This is normally under water, right?

100
00:05:35,728 --> 00:05:38,771
[Team Shinhwa and Team Running Man
anchor on the island of sand.]

101
00:05:45,915 --> 00:05:52,119
[The island stretches out for 5km
during the lowest tide.]

102
00:05:53,443 --> 00:05:58,564
This island is an infamous landmark in
the Western Sea called, The Puldeung Island.

103
00:05:58,565 --> 00:06:00,642
I'm really shocked to know
that a place like this even exists.

104
00:06:00,643 --> 00:06:04,238
[The mystical island showing off
it's wondrous beauty.]

105
00:06:05,996 --> 00:06:07,851
- It's amazing that a place like this exists.
- Ganjo.

106
00:06:07,852 --> 00:06:11,193
- What is 'Ganjo'?
- A place that sinks underwater at times.

107
00:06:11,797 --> 00:06:13,090
That's correct.

108
00:06:13,091 --> 00:06:16,045
[He almost had it right.]

109
00:06:16,046 --> 00:06:17,772
Gary is very smart.

110
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:20,442
<i>As you can see,
there are little flags in front of you.</i>

111
00:06:21,042 --> 00:06:23,297
<i>Are you all familiar with the movie,
'Far and Away'</i>

112
00:06:23,297 --> 00:06:25,516
<i>where they claimed their land
by staking the ground with their flag?</i>

113
00:06:25,517 --> 00:06:26,726
Yes, we know that movie.

114
00:06:26,727 --> 00:06:28,672
[The competition that is
about to take place...]

115
00:06:28,673 --> 00:06:32,691
[is just like what took place in the movie,
'Far and Away'...]

116
00:06:32,692 --> 00:06:35,765
[Claim your own land by staking
your flag into the ground.]

117
00:06:35,766 --> 00:06:38,148
<i>Choose the colored flag of your liking</i>

118
00:06:38,149 --> 00:06:42,261
<i>and go out as far away as you can
on the stretch of this island</i>

119
00:06:42,262 --> 00:06:43,917
<i>and stake your flag into the ground.</i>

120
00:06:43,918 --> 00:06:45,708
<i>That is the concept of this game.</i>

121
00:06:45,709 --> 00:06:47,905
<i>As you can see, there are ten flags.</i>

122
00:06:47,906 --> 00:06:50,919
<i>That means that two of you
will be without flags.</i>

123
00:06:51,663 --> 00:06:55,768
These guys here are like champions
when it comes to stuff like this.

124
00:06:55,769 --> 00:06:58,623
Do you know how hard
this is going to be for us?

125
00:06:58,624 --> 00:07:00,980
<i>Until you hear the sound of the whistle,
you can steal the flag from one another.</i>

126
00:07:00,981 --> 00:07:02,811
<i>There's no way we'll be
able to take it from them.</i>

127
00:07:02,812 --> 00:07:05,065
- We won't be able to take it from them.
- Ah, we can steal their flags?

128
00:07:06,304 --> 00:07:09,078
[Predicting a fierce battle
right from the start...]

129
00:07:09,079 --> 00:07:12,935
- How are we even going to do this?
- How are we to compete with these athletes?

130
00:07:13,631 --> 00:07:17,098
I don't think Eric would be much of a problem.
I think we'd be able to take him on.

131
00:07:17,099 --> 00:07:18,954
- We have to do our best.
- We have no other choice.

132
00:07:18,955 --> 00:07:21,397
- Eric is their weakness.
- Do you run or anything?

133
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:23,942
- I have bad knees.
- Is that right?

134
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:25,706
Sorry for clapping at that.

135
00:07:29,111 --> 00:07:33,114
[Will it be the veteran Running Man Team...]

136
00:07:33,149 --> 00:07:36,702
[Or will it be the infamous Shinhwa Team?]

137
00:07:37,222 --> 00:07:38,634
This is going to be difficult.

138
00:07:38,635 --> 00:07:41,310
[Ready!]

139
00:07:46,952 --> 00:07:48,704
[Go!]

140
00:07:51,588 --> 00:07:54,124
[Running towards the flags.]

141
00:08:01,964 --> 00:08:04,206
[Blank Ji shoved aside by the rough men
and falls to the ground.]

142
00:08:05,463 --> 00:08:08,159
Where do we go?
Let's go to the right.

143
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:11,391
[Giraffe took two flags as predicted,
and passes one off to Blank Ji.]

144
00:08:11,392 --> 00:08:13,002
Go that way!

145
00:08:15,335 --> 00:08:17,000
[Run as far as possible!]

146
00:08:19,047 --> 00:08:20,884
Let's go off to the other side.

147
00:08:28,576 --> 00:08:31,879
[Stake your flags into where
you're standing right now!]

148
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,078
Good job.

149
00:08:42,618 --> 00:08:43,711
What the heck?

150
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:48,052
[What?
Jun Jin doesn't have a flag?]

151
00:08:48,053 --> 00:08:50,958
- You don't have a flag?
- You didn't get a flag?

152
00:08:51,273 --> 00:08:52,907
Jin didn't get a flag.

153
00:08:53,747 --> 00:08:56,763
How is it that Jin...
Jin didn't get a flag?

154
00:08:56,764 --> 00:08:58,143
What the heck?

155
00:08:58,346 --> 00:09:00,407
[Even Blank Ji has a flag...]

156
00:09:02,045 --> 00:09:04,913
Jun Jin... how could you not
have gotten a flag?

157
00:09:04,914 --> 00:09:08,138
- Who's the other person?
- I think it's Jun Jin and Suk Jin.

158
00:09:08,139 --> 00:09:11,038
[Jun Jin, Mr. Capable of Team Shinhwa
fails to procure a flag.]

159
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:13,965
[And on Team Running Man,
it is of course, Big-nose Brother...]

160
00:09:13,966 --> 00:09:17,915
- My plan was to just get it from someone.
- Really? Our plan was to avoid you.

161
00:09:17,916 --> 00:09:22,313
- You got the furthest distance.
- We beat Shinhwa!

162
00:09:24,441 --> 00:09:27,136
- Hey, we won.
- We practically won this thing.

163
00:09:27,137 --> 00:09:29,130
We won the first game.

164
00:09:29,131 --> 00:09:33,413
<i>Everyone, you will now be given
your real rules of the game.</i>

165
00:09:33,414 --> 00:09:35,217
- What is it?
- There are more rules?

166
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:42,138
- There's more stuff?
- As you can see, there is a boat out front.

167
00:09:42,139 --> 00:09:43,157
Yes.

168
00:09:43,158 --> 00:09:50,772
<i>From that boat, a pirate captain will choose
one of the flags through a random drawing.</i>

169
00:09:51,554 --> 00:09:53,967
<i>The person who crosses the finish line...</i>

170
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:57,282
<i>with the same colored flag that
the pirate chooses</i>

171
00:09:57,283 --> 00:10:02,175
<i>in their hand will be
the ultimate winner of this game.</i>

172
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:06,551
- So going out far wasn't a good thing.
- The person with the same colored flag...

173
00:10:06,552 --> 00:10:10,045
<i>must cross the finish line
with the flag in hand.</i>

174
00:10:10,918 --> 00:10:16,001
<i>And those without that colored flag must
take that colored flag away from the person.</i>

175
00:10:16,002 --> 00:10:19,830
We have to protect our own members,
and take the flag away from our opposing team.

176
00:10:19,831 --> 00:10:22,786
So this is going to be played
rugby style.

177
00:10:23,826 --> 00:10:25,825
It's not good to go too far out.

178
00:10:27,423 --> 00:10:28,716
<i>Ready.</i>

179
00:10:30,024 --> 00:10:31,020
Take a good look.

180
00:10:31,021 --> 00:10:32,541
Look to see what color the flag is.

181
00:10:34,272 --> 00:10:40,067
[What colored flag will the pirate captain
lift up from the boat?]

182
00:10:40,068 --> 00:10:42,666
[A blue flag!]

183
00:10:44,246 --> 00:10:46,130
Who has the blue flag?

184
00:10:46,131 --> 00:10:50,628
- Blue!
- Who? Who is it?

185
00:10:50,629 --> 00:10:53,382
- Blue! Blue flag!
- Who? Who has it?

186
00:10:54,099 --> 00:10:55,456
Run, Jae Suk!

187
00:10:55,457 --> 00:10:56,585
[Right in front of Jae Suk!]

188
00:10:56,586 --> 00:10:58,566
Blue!
The color is blue!

189
00:11:01,909 --> 00:11:06,793
[Running towards the finish line
with the blue flag in hand.]

190
00:11:06,794 --> 00:11:08,597
His shoe fell off!

191
00:11:08,598 --> 00:11:10,619
[But that doesn't stop his chase!]

192
00:11:14,454 --> 00:11:16,149
[Catch!]

193
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:18,538
[Nice catch!]

194
00:11:18,539 --> 00:11:20,165
Get Kwang Soo!

195
00:11:22,697 --> 00:11:24,138
Suk Jin!

196
00:11:24,139 --> 00:11:27,681
[A dazzling play of passing game.]

197
00:11:33,921 --> 00:11:34,945
Gary.

198
00:11:38,196 --> 00:11:40,706
- No!
- Get it, Jae Suk.

199
00:11:41,876 --> 00:11:44,459
[A tug-of-war over the flag.]

200
00:11:46,407 --> 00:11:49,488
[Yoo Hyuk not letting go of the flag.]

201
00:11:51,288 --> 00:11:52,451
Tickle him.

202
00:11:54,644 --> 00:11:57,700
[Proposing that they play jump ball as in
a basketball game to determine who gets it.]

203
00:11:58,154 --> 00:12:01,741
[Giant Giraffe is chosen to be the person
to toss up the flag.]

204
00:12:01,742 --> 00:12:03,530
- Toss it towards the middle?
- Right there.

205
00:12:03,531 --> 00:12:05,081
Ready?

206
00:12:06,762 --> 00:12:09,865
[Shinhwa having exhausted themselves out
from the fierce physical competition.]

207
00:12:09,866 --> 00:12:11,176
This is exhausting.

208
00:12:11,645 --> 00:12:14,182
[It's between Yoo Hyuk and Min Woo.]

209
00:12:14,183 --> 00:12:16,728
[Huh?]

210
00:12:20,197 --> 00:12:22,623
[Figures...]

211
00:12:27,955 --> 00:12:30,563
[Kwang Soo makes it!]

212
00:12:30,564 --> 00:12:32,680
I can't believe he did that.

213
00:12:32,681 --> 00:12:34,530
How could he do something like that?

214
00:12:36,309 --> 00:12:39,529
[Experiencing firsthand what it is like
to be betrayed by the Giraffe.]

215
00:12:40,036 --> 00:12:42,562
- We can't win unless we do that.
- No, we can't.

216
00:12:42,563 --> 00:12:45,233
[His first taste of betrayal.]

217
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:48,461
We all knew that Kwang Soo would
run off with that flag.

218
00:12:48,462 --> 00:12:50,440
Yeah, we all knew.
But you guys didn't know, did you?

219
00:12:50,441 --> 00:12:52,302
That's why we asked him
to be the tosser.

220
00:12:52,303 --> 00:12:56,148
- I can't believe these guys.
- Lee Kwang Soo passed the first round.

221
00:12:57,226 --> 00:13:01,372
- Lee Kwang Soo may now step aside.
- Is he not participating anymore?

222
00:13:01,373 --> 00:13:02,567
He's not participating anymore?

223
00:13:02,568 --> 00:13:06,130
<i>The first team to win
three rounds of the game wins.</i>

224
00:13:06,248 --> 00:13:09,605
<i>Which means, Running Man needs to win
two more rounds of the game.</i>

225
00:13:09,606 --> 00:13:11,907
<i>And the pirate team needs to win
three more rounds of the game.</i>

226
00:13:11,908 --> 00:13:14,356
These guys really have aged.

227
00:13:14,357 --> 00:13:18,479
- Why would you trust Kwang Soo?
- Look at how we knew what to anticipate.

228
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,617
- We didn't know.
- They're so easy to scheme.

229
00:13:21,618 --> 00:13:23,480
You can't trust Kwang Soo.

230
00:13:24,255 --> 00:13:28,356
The reason why these guys are like this is
because no one betrayed anyone in the past.

231
00:13:28,357 --> 00:13:30,733
- I didn't even fathom that happening.
- Betrayal didn't used to exist in games.

232
00:13:30,734 --> 00:13:33,616
[The 'betrayal-nista',
leading a new trend in variety games.]

233
00:13:33,617 --> 00:13:37,536
[Steal the flag- Round Two.]

234
00:13:37,537 --> 00:13:42,799
[What color will it be this time?]

235
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,109
[A white flag!]

236
00:13:46,009 --> 00:13:47,446
It's mine!

237
00:13:49,585 --> 00:13:52,954
[Find the white flag that Blank Ji
staked into the ground!]

238
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:00,387
[Kkuk's dead run.]

239
00:14:02,287 --> 00:14:03,454
Finish it, Jong Kook.

240
00:14:06,446 --> 00:14:08,301
[Min Woo's quick body check.]

241
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:12,469

243
00:14:18,263 --> 00:14:21,113
[Team Running Man's
concentrated defense line.]

244
00:14:26,416 --> 00:14:29,392

his actions than expected.]

dazzling pass play.]

surprising work of relay teamwork.]

00:14:45,357 --> 00:14:48,271
[Eric makes a direct pass over to Jun Jin.]

249
00:14:52,777 --> 00:14:54,668
[A fantastic pass.]

250
00:14:54,669 --> 00:14:56,633
[Jun Jin makes the goal!]

251
00:14:56,634 --> 00:14:58,170
These guys are way too good.

252
00:15:00,593 --> 00:15:02,532
He's like a real football player.

253
00:15:02,533 --> 00:15:04,654
He's literally flying around here.

254
00:15:05,796 --> 00:15:07,874
We can't compete against these guys.

255
00:15:08,352 --> 00:15:11,082
- Wow.
- You need to play better defense!

256
00:15:12,625 --> 00:15:14,820
Why did you let Min Woo beat you?

257
00:15:14,821 --> 00:15:17,318
- I got tired out.
- You lost to Min Woo.

258
00:15:18,219 --> 00:15:20,490
- Listen to me.
- What are you going to say now?

259
00:15:20,491 --> 00:15:25,205
Even though they played good teamwork,
they had themselves well positioned.

260
00:15:25,389 --> 00:15:28,974
- They had themselves really well positioned.
- You should've grabbed the flag.

261
00:15:28,975 --> 00:15:30,616
You should've took the flag
from the beginning.

262
00:15:30,915 --> 00:15:33,933
- I can't believe you lost to him.
- What were you thinking?

263
00:15:33,934 --> 00:15:36,466
[Team Shinhwa laughing over
their bickering.]

264
00:15:37,212 --> 00:15:39,321
- The old feeling is starting to come back.
- I know.

265
00:15:39,555 --> 00:15:43,483
You guys are finally starting to laugh.
Hye Sung is starting to laugh now.

266
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:45,778
[Doing the crab dance now that they're
starting to get the old feelings back?]

267
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:47,382
[Dancing the dance for the first time
in ten years?]

268
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,260
We have to get serious now.

269
00:15:51,964 --> 00:15:53,766
- We have to get serious.
- We have to get this done.

270
00:15:53,767 --> 00:15:56,866
Now that Shinhwa got their laughter back,
we've lost our ability to laugh.

271
00:15:57,310 --> 00:15:59,107
- We have to take the flag.
- Ready!

272

with a diversion.]

288

[A direct pass to Eric!]

290
00:16:50,298 --> 00:16:52,206
[A scene right out of a martial arts movie.]

Toss it up in the air.

299

I didn't know that.

334
00:19:02,096 --> 00:19:04,981
- You guys are just too much.
- I don't think he knew he had to do that.

335
00:19:05,854 --> 00:19:08,173
[Team Running Man - 2
Team Shinhwa- 1.]

336
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:13,281
[A fierce mental competition on the island.]

337
00:19:18,381 --> 00:19:21,026
[Orange!]

338
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,996
- Off to the right over there!
- Is that it?

339
00:19:26,538 --> 00:19:28,748
[Yoo-ruce Willis makes a dash for it.]

340
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:32,031
We have to block him.

341
00:19:33,744 --> 00:19:35,240
Go run over there.

342
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:40,945
Over here!
There you go!

343
00:19:40,946 --> 00:19:42,354
[A nice back pass?]

344
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:47,731
[A missed pass turns the whole game around.]

345
00:19:47,732 --> 00:19:49,121
Grab him!

346
00:19:49,122 --> 00:19:50,539
Get him!
You have to get him!

347
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:52,045
Get him!

348
00:19:54,614 --> 00:19:57,542
[Kkuk shoves him over to the finish line.]

349
00:19:57,543 --> 00:19:59,926
[Min Woo passes.]

350
00:20:02,492 --> 00:20:04,483
With Kim Jong Kook's assist...

351
00:20:04,484 --> 00:20:05,940
Shinhwa wins!

352
00:20:06,181 --> 00:20:09,562
[Back to an even score!
One last final round.]

353
00:20:09,563 --> 00:20:10,921
You have to get yourselves together.

354
00:20:11,939 --> 00:20:13,167
Let's have everyone come back in the game.

355
00:20:13,168 --> 00:20:15,694
[Everyone come back in the game
for the final round?]

356
00:20:15,695 --> 00:20:18,143
- That's a great idea.
- Why, are you afraid you'll lose?

357
00:20:18,144 --> 00:20:20,230
- They're afraid that they'll lose.
- I doubt it.

358
00:20:20,809 --> 00:20:23,501
[Then without the exception of Blank Ji,
Team Running Man- 6 vs. Team Shinhwa- 5.]

359
00:20:23,502 --> 00:20:26,335
I haven't smelled the sweet smell of
manly sweat in a long time.

360
00:20:26,649 --> 00:20:29,255
With Shinhwa here, the beast
inside of me is starting to wake up.

361
00:20:29,256 --> 00:20:32,282
[The beastly instinct slowly
starting to make a comeback.]

362
00:20:32,283 --> 00:20:34,634
[The fierce glint in their eyes are back.]

363
00:20:34,635 --> 00:20:37,569
[Who is this wild beast?]

364
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:40,257
Since this is the final round,
we'll do one last cheer before we play.

365
00:20:40,258 --> 00:20:42,754
Our opponents have finally noticed
that we've been going easy on them.

366
00:20:42,755 --> 00:20:44,605
Let's not go easy on them anymore.

367
00:20:44,606 --> 00:20:47,629
- Let's show them what we're made of.
- Okay, let's do this.

368
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:49,581
One, two, three.
Running Man!

369
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:51,749
[We're not going to go easy on you anymore!]

370
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:54,396
One, two, three.
Shinhwa!

371
00:20:54,397 --> 00:20:56,342
[Shall we start playing for real?]

372
00:20:56,343 --> 00:20:58,586
- I will shoot to start.
- Okay.

373
00:20:58,587 --> 00:21:00,108
- Don't shoot us.
- Okay.

374
00:21:00,109 --> 00:21:03,091
- You watch yourself, Jae Suk.
- I wouldn't put it past you.

375
00:21:03,092 --> 00:21:04,741
Just shoot it.

376
00:21:06,368 --> 00:21:09,075
Okay, ready!

377
00:21:13,283 --> 00:21:16,474
One, two, three!

378
00:21:20,543 --> 00:21:22,365
[Purple!]

379
00:21:24,375 --> 00:21:27,273
[Find the purple flag!]

380
00:21:27,274 --> 00:21:28,433
You have to run.

381
00:21:28,434 --> 00:21:29,525
Is that it?

382
00:21:30,633 --> 00:21:31,777
No, that's not it!

383
00:21:33,397 --> 00:21:34,656
- Is that it?
- That's it.

384
00:21:34,657 --> 00:21:37,172
[The purple flag way out in the distance.]

385
00:21:41,295 --> 00:21:44,193
[Quick footed Min Woo getting
possession of the flag once again.]

386
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:45,699
Be careful.

387
00:21:46,192 --> 00:21:50,179
[A strong break to the front of the line
with his quick speed.]

388
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:56,177
[Another brilliant show of teamwork.]

389
00:21:56,178 --> 00:21:57,665
Throw it!

390
00:21:58,498 --> 00:22:00,730
[Gary steals the flag!]

391
00:22:00,731 --> 00:22:03,338
[A long pass into the air.]

392
00:22:05,081 --> 00:22:08,028
[Hye Sung catches the pass!]

393
00:22:08,029 --> 00:22:10,931
[And throws it directly over to Eric.]

394
00:22:11,833 --> 00:22:15,399
[They make their way close to the
finish line within a blink of an eye.]

395
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,701
[Yoo Hyuk's desperate tackle.]

396
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:26,271
[Kkuk intercepts the pass.]

397
00:22:28,522 --> 00:22:31,117
[Front of the finish line is
very densely populated.]

398
00:22:34,188 --> 00:22:36,211
[Big-nosed Brother feebly
drops it to the ground.]

399
00:22:38,876 --> 00:22:41,215
[Throws him down to the ground.]

400
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:47,261
[The flag is passed off to Haroro.]

401
00:22:47,262 --> 00:22:49,614
[Giraffe misses the important pass.]

402
00:22:51,336 --> 00:22:54,221
[Flag is back in Team Shinhwa's possession.]

403
00:22:54,222 --> 00:22:56,012
Be careful and toss it.

404
00:22:59,707 --> 00:23:02,407
[A straight breakthrough.]

405
00:23:02,875 --> 00:23:05,679
[The finish line is right
in front of their nose!]

406
00:23:10,408 --> 00:23:12,261
[What?]

407
00:23:16,008 --> 00:23:17,972
[Goal]

408
00:23:19,893 --> 00:23:21,805
[Wow...
to make it pass amidst all that chaos?]

409
00:23:21,806 --> 00:23:23,376
Okay, the practice game is now over.

410
00:23:25,984 --> 00:23:28,886
[Team Shinhwa wins.]

411
00:23:34,734 --> 00:23:37,565
[Like a wild buffalo
breaking through the herd.]

412
00:23:37,566 --> 00:23:39,108
Shinhwa's finally back.

413
00:23:41,951 --> 00:23:46,380
<i>We will now give a hint to Shinhwa
for having won this game.</i>

414
00:23:49,674 --> 00:23:51,247
<i>You have to look only amongst
yourselves.</i>

415
00:23:53,581 --> 00:23:57,532
<i>And Team Running Man will be given
an ambiguous hint.</i>

416
00:23:57,533 --> 00:23:59,158
<i>You have to look secretly
amongst yourselves as well.</i>

417
00:24:00,791 --> 00:24:05,521
[Steal the shoe from the undead.]

418
00:24:05,522 --> 00:24:06,894
The undead?

419
00:24:06,895 --> 00:24:09,460
[Steal the shoe from the undead?]

420
00:24:12,249 --> 00:24:15,986
[Steal the ___ from the undead.]

421
00:24:15,987 --> 00:24:17,559
We'll never be able to
figure it out from that.

422
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:20,487
- Let's just go.
- You guys all played great.

423
00:24:20,488 --> 00:24:21,663
[Happy with having played their best.]

424
00:24:24,473 --> 00:24:25,593
No way!

425
00:24:25,594 --> 00:24:27,849
[Curse or a blessing?
The existence of the undead...]

426
00:24:27,850 --> 00:24:30,497
[Who is the undead?]

427
00:24:35,921 --> 00:24:38,753
[The pirate restaurant.]

428
00:24:38,753 --> 00:24:41,313
<i>- I assume the both teams are very hungry?
- Yes, we are.</i>

429
00:24:41,314 --> 00:24:43,154
Yes, we're very hungry.

430
00:24:43,155 --> 00:24:46,485
<i>We will now start your meal.</i>

431
00:24:46,486 --> 00:24:48,373
[What price will the meal at the
Pirate Restaurant be?]

432
00:24:48,951 --> 00:24:51,352
<i>Do you see the menus that
are behind you?</i>

433
00:24:52,899 --> 00:24:54,800
- Can we order whatever we want?
- Let's order.

434
00:24:54,801 --> 00:24:57,961
- Wow, I don't know what I want.
- Who stuck all those menu items up there?

435
00:24:58,431 --> 00:25:02,882
<i>The team that won the previous game may
first order what they'd like off the menu.</i>

436
00:25:02,883 --> 00:25:04,909
[Team Shinhwa gets to order first
for having won the previous game.]

437
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:06,624
We're going to have the spicy chicken soup.

438
00:25:07,737 --> 00:25:11,936
[Team Shinhwa chooses a
spicy bowl of chicken soup.]

439
00:25:12,417 --> 00:25:17,188
<i>In order to be able to eat your meal...
you have to play a game and win.</i>

440
00:25:17,518 --> 00:25:23,230
[It's the food competition between
The Pirates and Running Man.]

441
00:25:24,313 --> 00:25:27,142
- You never just let us eat.
- Can't you just let us eat?

442
00:25:27,143 --> 00:25:29,668
- Can't we just eat our meal in peace?
- Why won't you just let us eat?

443
00:25:29,669 --> 00:25:31,027
[Full of complaints.]

444
00:25:31,028 --> 00:25:33,242
- All I got today was a mouthful of sand.
- Shouldn't you feed us at least one meal?

445
00:25:33,243 --> 00:25:34,499
What is this?

446
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:38,808
<i>Your spicy chicken menu game is...
Toe Competition.</i>

447
00:25:38,809 --> 00:25:40,570
- What?
- What is he talking about?

448
00:25:40,571 --> 00:25:44,565
<i>Each team has to pick one representative
to play the game</i>

449
00:25:44,566 --> 00:25:47,244
<i>and it is essentially a form of
the thumb war, but played with your big toe.</i>

450
00:25:47,245 --> 00:25:49,876
<i>Pick one member from your team whom
you think would be best for this game.</i>

451
00:25:49,877 --> 00:25:54,305
<i>But, once a member plays a game, that person
is excluded from all the other games.</i>

452
00:25:54,306 --> 00:25:56,156
When it comes to toes,
isn't Kwang Soo the best?

453
00:25:56,157 --> 00:25:57,427
You have to think very carefully about this.

454
00:25:57,428 --> 00:26:00,274
If you play this game, then you
can't participate in the other games.

455
00:26:00,275 --> 00:26:03,308
[But there are other games
to consider too...]

456
00:26:03,309 --> 00:26:05,624
- We choose Kwang Soo.
- Kwang Soo!

457
00:26:06,574 --> 00:26:08,961
[Shinhwa's representative is, Jun Jin.]

458
00:26:10,975 --> 00:26:13,427
Jun Jin is very strong.
You have to watch yourself.

459
00:26:15,431 --> 00:26:17,189
[Even his foot is extremely large...]

460
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:18,757
It's gross how big his foot is.

461
00:26:18,758 --> 00:26:20,624
How can you say that my foot is gross?

462
00:26:21,175 --> 00:26:23,396
- My shoe size is 290.
- Wow, that's gross.

463
00:26:24,543 --> 00:26:26,447
Please intertwine your toes
with one another.

464
00:26:26,448 --> 00:26:29,090
You know what to do, right, Kwang Soo?
You know what to do with your toes.

465
00:26:31,902 --> 00:26:34,800
Just to let you know, Kwang Soo...
Jun Jin doesn't wash his feet very often.

466
00:26:34,801 --> 00:26:36,273
Kwang Soo never washes his feet.

467
00:26:37,404 --> 00:26:39,822
[A mental battle between them
over cleanliness and hygiene?]

468
00:26:39,823 --> 00:26:41,677
- I'm starting to feel the sensation.
- Are you feeling the sensation?

469
00:26:41,678 --> 00:26:44,403
I've never seen two men sitting around
with their toes intertwined like that before.

470
00:26:44,404 --> 00:26:45,676
[Even though they're seeing it,
it's still a strange sight to behold.]

471
00:26:45,677 --> 00:26:47,159
I feel really shy right now.

472
00:26:48,101 --> 00:26:50,284
- What kind of a game is this?
- What are you making us do right now?

473
00:26:50,658 --> 00:26:53,418
[Maybe a commemorative picture
of this moment?]

474
00:26:55,807 --> 00:26:58,666
[This is probably the very first picture
ever taken of such a scene.]

475
00:26:58,667 --> 00:27:00,933
Kwang Soo.
You have to hook line him first, okay?

476
00:27:00,934 --> 00:27:02,947
I've never done this before,
so I'm not sure if I'm doing this right.

477
00:27:02,948 --> 00:27:04,907
Do you think Jin's done this before?
Where would he ever have played this?

478
00:27:04,908 --> 00:27:06,527
This is my first time too.

479
00:27:06,528 --> 00:27:08,899
- You think it's first time just for you?
- I was just making a comment.

480
00:27:09,489 --> 00:27:12,076
Can't you just cheer me on
instead of berating me?

481
00:27:12,777 --> 00:27:15,185
So if Kwang Soo wins this round,
does it mean that we get the chicken soup?

482
00:27:15,186 --> 00:27:16,335
- Yes, that's correct.
- Really?

483
00:27:16,336 --> 00:27:18,441
- With just this one round?
- That's it.

484
00:27:18,442 --> 00:27:21,202
[This one round will determine
who gets to eat the chicken!]

485
00:27:21,694 --> 00:27:22,928
- Really?
- That's right.

486
00:27:23,438 --> 00:27:25,055
Fighting!

487
00:27:25,772 --> 00:27:28,403
[The spicy chicken soup making
everyone desperately cheer them on.]

488
00:27:28,404 --> 00:27:32,270
<i>Jun Jin!</i>

489
00:27:32,523 --> 00:27:34,579
I need you to cheer for me too.

490
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:35,660
Just hurry up and do it!

491
00:27:37,035 --> 00:27:39,506
Kwang Soo!

492
00:27:39,507 --> 00:27:42,715
[A jeer instead of a cheer?]

493
00:27:44,138 --> 00:27:47,033
- Kwang Soo, you know what to do, right?
- Kwang Soo, do a good job.

494
00:27:47,068 --> 00:27:48,252
Ready.

495
00:27:49,188 --> 00:27:51,696
[The world's first ever toe competition.]

496
00:27:54,807 --> 00:27:56,814
Wait, the other team is much closer.

497
00:27:57,971 --> 00:28:00,170
['Mr. Kim-Just leave it'
butting in once again.]

498
00:28:00,171 --> 00:28:02,194
- What are you doing?
- No, listen.

499
00:28:02,195 --> 00:28:05,724
But look at how the starting line
on this thing isn't matching up with this.

500
00:28:07,071 --> 00:28:11,094
- Yeah, you have to line it up like this.
- Kim Jong Kook!

501
00:28:11,095 --> 00:28:13,354
- No, we have to line it up together.
- In a straight line.

502
00:28:13,355 --> 00:28:16,874
- The line is right here.
- Their toes are turning blue! Just hurry.

503
00:28:17,912 --> 00:28:20,200
You have to lean your body over this way
so that you have more strength in your toes.

504
00:28:20,733 --> 00:28:22,683
But then I'll have my back towards
the camera.

505
00:28:22,684 --> 00:28:25,177
- Who cares? Just around.
- It doesn't matter if you're not on camera.

506
00:28:25,178 --> 00:28:27,059
- Just turn around.
- Why don't I turn this way then?

507
00:28:30,493 --> 00:28:32,231
Can you still see me on camera?

508
00:28:32,232 --> 00:28:34,200
There's a camera over there too.

509
00:28:34,686 --> 00:28:37,201
[We're shooting from every angle.]

510
00:28:39,208 --> 00:28:42,260
You have to find the center balance.
Jin has to come forward a bit more.

511
00:28:42,261 --> 00:28:44,401
Move forward a little,
and you move back a bit more.

512
00:28:44,402 --> 00:28:46,731
- Why do you want him to go backwards?
- Because your feet aren't centered.

513
00:28:46,732 --> 00:28:49,675
[A strange claim of their feet
not being balanced.]

514
00:28:49,676 --> 00:28:51,055
You have to come forward a bit more.

515
00:28:51,056 --> 00:28:54,028
Come forward, and you go backward.
See? Your feet aren't balanced.

516
00:28:54,029 --> 00:28:56,009
Can you get us a better referee?

517
00:28:56,010 --> 00:28:57,755
Do you think I like sitting here with
your toes in my hands right now?

518
00:28:57,756 --> 00:28:59,316
I don't want to be touching your toes!

519
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:02,665
I don't know what's going on here.

520
00:29:02,666 --> 00:29:04,464
He doesn't like touching people's toes.

521
00:29:04,465 --> 00:29:07,540
I've seen Jin a countless times before,
but this is my first time seeing his toes.

522
00:29:07,541 --> 00:29:09,485
[Even though he's known him for a long time,
he's never seen his toes before.]

523
00:29:09,486 --> 00:29:11,614
Ready.
Set, go!

524
00:29:26,631 --> 00:29:28,419
You can do this.

525
00:29:31,576 --> 00:29:34,202
[To all our children viewers-
Please don't follow in their footsteps.]

526
00:29:37,792 --> 00:29:38,891
A little bit more!

527
00:29:40,666 --> 00:29:44,484
[Invalid because the wall was knocked
down by dragging over his foot.]

528
00:29:45,384 --> 00:29:47,303
[Pain in their toes?]

529
00:29:48,570 --> 00:29:50,154
I can't do this anymore!

530
00:29:50,155 --> 00:29:51,877
I really can't do this anymore!

531
00:29:51,878 --> 00:29:55,341
[Sort of agony that he's never felt
in his life before..]

532
00:29:55,756 --> 00:29:58,185
The person who's toes breaks off first
loses the game.

533
00:30:00,438 --> 00:30:02,720
I'll put my second toe
on the line on this game!

534
00:30:02,721 --> 00:30:04,175
How about we switch our feet?

535
00:30:04,176 --> 00:30:06,951
[Agrees to switch feet.]

536
00:30:06,952 --> 00:30:09,357
Don't allow Jong kook to wear
stuff like that anymore.

537
00:30:10,033 --> 00:30:12,648
['Mr. Kim-leave it' in a white one piece.]

538
00:30:12,649 --> 00:30:13,759
Why?
It's nice and cool.

539
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:16,530
Even Ji Hyo is all covered up here,
so why are you dressed like that?

540
00:30:17,169 --> 00:30:19,796
- One piece?
- He's wearing a one piece right now.

541
00:30:22,075 --> 00:30:24,650
[A re-match with their left feet.]

542
00:30:28,697 --> 00:30:30,998
[A fierce competition with their left feet!]

543
00:30:32,028 --> 00:30:34,245
[Jun Jin with his teeth gritted.]

544
00:30:35,405 --> 00:30:37,202
[Giraffe enduring the pain
with his monstrous strength.]

545
00:30:37,203 --> 00:30:39,354
[Giraffe's left foot is not easy to defeat.]

546
00:30:40,853 --> 00:30:44,159
Spicy chicken soup!

547
00:30:44,892 --> 00:30:46,884
[The spicy chicken soup bringing out
the monstrous strength in him.]

548
00:30:50,896 --> 00:30:53,164
[The game may be coming to a close...]

549
00:31:02,625 --> 00:31:06,662
[Ah, the foot slips again...]

550
00:31:06,953 --> 00:31:09,403
I can't do it! I lose.
You win!

551
00:31:10,370 --> 00:31:12,408
[Throwing in the towel?]

552
00:31:13,181 --> 00:31:15,639
[Ouch...]

553
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:16,992
Did I win?

554
00:31:18,372 --> 00:31:20,877
[Cooley gives up on the game.]

555
00:31:21,471 --> 00:31:23,557
You pulled your foot back
from the pain, right?

556
00:31:23,558 --> 00:31:25,533
I know you pulled
your foot back from the pain.

557
00:31:25,534 --> 00:31:28,741
[Toe wrestle- Team Running Man wins!]

558
00:31:30,254 --> 00:31:32,619
[Wins the spicy chicken soup.]

559
00:31:34,101 --> 00:31:35,675
I think he pulled his foot back
because of the pain.

560
00:31:35,676 --> 00:31:38,961
- He pulled his foot back from the pain.
- I've never felt that kind of pain before.

561
00:31:40,157 --> 00:31:44,912
Team Running Man has gained
the spicy chicken soup on their lunch menu.

562
00:31:45,937 --> 00:31:49,182
Spicy chicken soup!
Spicy chicken soup!

563
00:31:49,183 --> 00:31:50,794
I really wanted to have that for lunch.

564
00:31:52,001 --> 00:31:53,247
What should we choose?

565
00:31:53,248 --> 00:31:55,381
[It's Team Running Man's turn
to choose the menu.]

566
00:31:57,936 --> 00:32:01,031
[Their menu of choosing is, rockfish sushi.]

567
00:32:01,395 --> 00:32:04,501
The next game you'll be playing is,
'Pirate Disco King'.

568
00:32:04,502 --> 00:32:05,552
How do we play?

569
00:32:05,553 --> 00:32:09,078
All the team members will dance their
heart out with a pair of headphones on.

570
00:32:09,341 --> 00:32:11,713
But, with the exception of one person,
no music will play on the headphones.

571
00:32:11,714 --> 00:32:15,911
So to win the game, you have to find the
one person who actually is dancing to music.

572
00:32:15,912 --> 00:32:18,331
[Find the one person who's actually
dancing along to the beat of music.]

573
00:32:18,756 --> 00:32:20,319
We're good at things like this.

574
00:32:20,823 --> 00:32:23,268
[Having a meeting first to determine
who will actually be listening to music.]

575
00:32:24,443 --> 00:32:29,753
Only one person out of the group is actually
hearing music through their headphones.

576
00:32:29,754 --> 00:32:32,713
The music is currently playing
through the headphones right now.

577
00:32:34,272 --> 00:32:39,202
[Given time is one minute.
Find the music listener within that time.]

578
00:32:39,203 --> 00:32:40,743
[Go!]

579
00:32:43,444 --> 00:32:44,906
Andy.

580
00:32:44,907 --> 00:32:47,487
[Too busy dancing to pay attention
to anything that they're saying.]

581
00:32:47,488 --> 00:32:48,825
Yeah!

582
00:32:48,826 --> 00:32:54,289
[Just which one of them is listening to
actual music being played? Can you guess?]

583
00:32:54,290 --> 00:32:55,639
It's not Min Woo.

584
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:58,293
- I have no idea.
- I think it's Andy.

585
00:32:58,294 --> 00:32:59,760
I want to say it's Andy.

586
00:32:59,761 --> 00:33:01,674
No, Andy's always been really weird.

587
00:33:03,444 --> 00:33:05,561
No, Andy's always been really weird.

588
00:33:07,019 --> 00:33:09,005
[Did he hear that comment?]

589
00:33:11,795 --> 00:33:13,286
- It's not Andy.
- Hey, Andy.

590
00:33:13,287 --> 00:33:15,912
- Can you hear us?
- He can hear us.

591
00:33:16,365 --> 00:33:19,335
[Then could it be poker faced Jun Jin?]

592
00:33:19,336 --> 00:33:21,575
- Min Woo's laughing too.
- He's laughing at our comment on Andy.

593
00:33:21,854 --> 00:33:24,176
[Min Woo suddenly bursting out
in bouts of laughter.]

594
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:28,357
No, no.
No, it's not him.

595
00:33:28,358 --> 00:33:30,494
- No, it's not him.
- Ten seconds left.

596
00:33:30,495 --> 00:33:31,780
[Ten seconds left on the clock.]

597
00:33:31,781 --> 00:33:32,859
Could it be Hye Sung?

598
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:35,330
- But the way that they're dancing...
- I don't think it's him.

599
00:33:35,331 --> 00:33:38,249
I'm positive that it's not Andy or Hye Sung.

600
00:33:38,856 --> 00:33:40,813
[Time over!]

601
00:33:40,814 --> 00:33:42,983
- I have no idea.
- I think it's Jun Jin.

602
00:33:42,984 --> 00:33:44,544
I really don't know.

603
00:33:44,545 --> 00:33:46,959
[So confusing...]

604
00:33:47,170 --> 00:33:49,636
And there's Eric to consider too.

605
00:33:49,637 --> 00:33:51,504
I saw Min Woo laughing.

606
00:33:51,505 --> 00:33:53,692
Andy heard everything that we've said.

607
00:33:56,966 --> 00:34:00,684
You'll make your selection after watching
each of them dance separately.

608
00:34:00,685 --> 00:34:04,373
- Am I first?
- Everyone stay still while Andy dances.

609
00:34:04,374 --> 00:34:06,351
Ready, set, go.

610
00:34:08,929 --> 00:34:10,542
- He really is...
- Look at Andy.

611
00:34:10,543 --> 00:34:12,529
Andy's laughing already because
he knows we're going to say something.

612
00:34:13,082 --> 00:34:15,139
[Keeping his eyes tightly shut.]

613
00:34:17,404 --> 00:34:18,874
No, it's not Andy.

614
00:34:18,875 --> 00:34:20,219
- It's not Andy.
- It's not Andy.

615
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:21,892
- Should I go next?
- Yes.

616
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:23,106
[Next up is, Hye Sung.]

617
00:34:25,763 --> 00:34:30,142
You have to turn the music on first.
Turn on the music.

618
00:34:30,143 --> 00:34:31,281
[Huh?]

619
00:34:34,755 --> 00:34:36,990
- It's not Hye Sung.
- Make sure to turn your music on.

620
00:34:36,991 --> 00:34:39,093
You can stop.
You can stop pretending now.

621
00:34:39,094 --> 00:34:41,010
He's always liked dancing to no music.

622
00:34:41,418 --> 00:34:43,042
It's not Hye Sung.

623
00:34:43,101 --> 00:34:45,351
Okay, it's Jun Jin's turn.

624
00:34:45,352 --> 00:34:47,174
[Next up, Jun Jin.]

625
00:34:47,175 --> 00:34:49,749
Jin's is really sly.
He's sly so you have to be cautious.

626
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:51,586
- I never know with Jun Jin.
- Is it you, Jun Jin?

627
00:34:54,814 --> 00:34:57,033
[Jun Jin grooving on his own.]

628
00:34:57,974 --> 00:34:59,537
Min Woo.
Let's see Min Woo next.

629
00:34:59,538 --> 00:35:00,862
I already did it.

630
00:35:01,478 --> 00:35:02,716
What?
You already did it?

631
00:35:02,717 --> 00:35:04,676
[Too loud of a voice...]

632
00:35:08,935 --> 00:35:10,617
If you press play,
you can hear the music playing.

633
00:35:12,449 --> 00:35:15,475
If he was listening to music,
he would've spoken louder.

634
00:35:16,576 --> 00:35:18,873
[Anyways, it's now time to dance.]

635
00:35:25,484 --> 00:35:27,873
[Is it the dance to one of Shinhwa's songs?]

636
00:35:27,874 --> 00:35:29,247
- Finally, Eric.
- Eric.

637
00:35:30,554 --> 00:35:32,751
[Acting very unnatural for
some reason...]

638
00:35:33,771 --> 00:35:35,376
No, it's okay.
We've made our decision.

639
00:35:36,299 --> 00:35:38,248
No, it's okay.
We've made our decision.

640
00:35:40,229 --> 00:35:42,458
[Mr. Cool taking off his headphones
in one smooth move.]

641
00:35:43,035 --> 00:35:44,520
That's so funny.

642
00:35:44,521 --> 00:35:46,392
Eric is so funny.

643
00:35:46,393 --> 00:35:49,548
Eric is funny.
I never knew how funny Eric was.

644
00:35:49,549 --> 00:35:51,702
- He's a very funny man.
- He's quite entertaining.

645
00:35:51,703 --> 00:35:53,566
Eric is funny.

646
00:35:53,567 --> 00:35:55,786
- Don't you think it's Jun Jin?
- I think it's Jin.

647
00:35:55,787 --> 00:35:59,037
[Is it Jun Jin?
Or is it Min Woo?]

648
00:35:59,038 --> 00:36:00,637
I think it's Jin.
I don't think it's Min Woo.

649
00:36:00,638 --> 00:36:03,060
Five, four, three, two, one.

650
00:36:03,061 --> 00:36:05,291
Jun Jin.

651
00:36:06,832 --> 00:36:08,628
[Powerful dance moves.]

652
00:36:08,629 --> 00:36:10,838
[Skilled dance moves
moving along to the beat.]

653
00:36:11,531 --> 00:36:14,961
[Was Jun Jin listening to actual music?]

654
00:36:17,642 --> 00:36:19,567
[Time to check for themselves.]

655
00:36:19,568 --> 00:36:21,330
I don't think it's him.

656
00:36:22,089 --> 00:36:23,171
Do I just press play?

657
00:36:23,439 --> 00:36:25,668
It's playing.
It's playing, right?

658
00:36:25,669 --> 00:36:27,699
- Do you hear music?
- Is music playing?

659
00:36:32,641 --> 00:36:34,070
That's not it.

660
00:36:37,045 --> 00:36:39,469
- It's not Jun Jin.
- Then who was it?

661
00:36:40,318 --> 00:36:42,247
- It's not Jin.
- Was it Andy?

662
00:36:42,248 --> 00:36:44,241
- Who was it?
- Then I bet it was Min Woo.

663
00:36:44,242 --> 00:36:45,994
[Then could it be Min Woo?]

664
00:36:45,995 --> 00:36:47,352
I bet it's Min Woo.

665
00:36:47,353 --> 00:36:49,757
[Min Woo, the dancing machine.]

666
00:36:49,758 --> 00:36:52,094
[Is dancing to no music
not a big deal for him?]

667
00:36:53,412 --> 00:36:54,450
Set, go.

668
00:36:54,451 --> 00:36:56,077
It's Min Woo.

669
00:36:57,395 --> 00:36:59,723
[Min Woo was the one!]

670
00:37:01,269 --> 00:37:04,292
[Dancing machine with acting skills to boot.]

671
00:37:05,178 --> 00:37:07,492
[Team Shinhwa wins the rockfish sushi.]

672
00:37:08,259 --> 00:37:11,278
<i>It's Team Shinhwa's turn
to choose an item off the menu.</i>

673
00:37:11,687 --> 00:37:14,683
- Can we choose the sushi again?
- Yes, you may.

674
00:37:15,208 --> 00:37:16,540
Rockfish sushi.

675
00:37:16,541 --> 00:37:17,824
[Chooses to add an additional order
of rockfish sushi to their menu.]

676
00:37:17,825 --> 00:37:21,220
<i>Your next game is called,
'Pirates of the sails'.</i>

677
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:26,500
<i>One member of each team will come up front
and sit with their knees off the ground</i>

678
00:37:26,501 --> 00:37:31,090
<i>and the person to scoot themselves on their
bottom to make a round wins the game.</i>

679
00:37:31,091 --> 00:37:32,615
- Like this?
- I think you should do it.

680
00:37:32,616 --> 00:37:34,830
- I don't know if I can do this.
- You mean, scoot along like this?

681
00:37:35,227 --> 00:37:36,972
Who wants to do this game?

682
00:37:37,271 --> 00:37:38,561
[Anyone can play this game.]

683
00:37:38,562 --> 00:37:40,676
- I think Jong Kook will be good for this.
- Okay, I'll do it.

684
00:37:40,677 --> 00:37:42,550
Jong Kook's going to do this round?

685
00:37:42,551 --> 00:37:44,252
Is some bodily contact allowed?

686
00:37:44,253 --> 00:37:46,165
Of course. That's the only
way to play this sort of game.

687
00:37:46,166 --> 00:37:48,022
Then I really want to do this game.

688
00:37:48,734 --> 00:37:50,463
I think Hye Sung would be really quick
in a game like this one.

689
00:37:50,464 --> 00:37:52,334
[Hye Sung may be the best candidate
from Team Shinhwa?]

690
00:37:52,335 --> 00:37:54,249
- Come on.
- This won't be tough.

691
00:37:54,250 --> 00:37:57,271
- We have to make this fun.
- How rough do you think I'm going to get?

692
00:37:57,272 --> 00:37:59,424
You're asking me to do it because
you're pretty sure I'd lose, right?

693
00:38:00,158 --> 00:38:02,860
If that was the case,
we'd be asking Eric to do it.

694
00:38:02,861 --> 00:38:05,251
[Ask Eric to play if they want a sure win?]

695
00:38:06,151 --> 00:38:09,633
Eric!

696
00:38:09,633 --> 00:38:11,165
You now have to make your decision.

697
00:38:11,166 --> 00:38:13,318
- Team Running Man?
- Kim Jong Kook.

698
00:38:13,905 --> 00:38:15,073
Team Shinhwa?

699
00:38:15,074 --> 00:38:18,731
[Team Shinhwa chooses
quick-footed Min Woo.]

700
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,444
Please come up to the front.

701
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:26,610
- Are you both ready?
- Yes.

702
00:38:26,611 --> 00:38:29,502
Do we go down the room,
and turn around this way?

703
00:38:29,503 --> 00:38:31,232
Or should we make a wide inward turn?

704
00:38:31,233 --> 00:38:33,028
- Make the inward turn.
- Okay, we'll do that.

705
00:38:33,029 --> 00:38:35,124
If we turn like that,
he'll be going around in the inner course.

706
00:38:36,235 --> 00:38:38,668
['Mr. Kim-Leave it' and his attention
for even playing ground.]

707
00:38:39,470 --> 00:38:41,903
We have to turn that way so that
we both have the same length of distance.

708
00:38:42,671 --> 00:38:45,097
He never used to talk this much
back in the day when he first started.

709
00:38:45,098 --> 00:38:47,209
[Having transformed into a
chatterbox since his earlier days?]

710
00:38:47,895 --> 00:38:49,257
Suk Jin.

711
00:38:49,925 --> 00:38:52,005
Can you sing us a song in cheer?

712
00:38:52,006 --> 00:38:54,147
I know you're good at coming up
with things like that.

713
00:38:54,148 --> 00:38:55,667
It doesn't even take him five seconds
to think up a song.

714
00:38:55,668 --> 00:38:58,257
- Say something for us.
- One, two, three, four.

715
00:38:59,004 --> 00:39:02,980
<i>I love the thick arms on Jong Kook.</i>

716
00:39:04,454 --> 00:39:06,483
Thick arms, fighting!

717
00:39:08,971 --> 00:39:11,940
[Comes up with the
'Thick arm song' out of nowhere.]

718
00:39:11,941 --> 00:39:13,216
That was a good song.

719
00:39:13,217 --> 00:39:16,337
The problem is that he himself is
embarrassed of what he just sang.

720
00:39:17,634 --> 00:39:19,572
What's there to be embarrassed about?

721
00:39:19,573 --> 00:39:22,048
Ready, set, go!

722
00:39:22,049 --> 00:39:26,993
[Quick footed Min Woo vs.
Muscle Boy, Kkuk.]

723
00:39:35,821 --> 00:39:37,226
Look at the expression on his face.

724
00:39:40,139 --> 00:39:42,539
[Neck and neck speed!]

725
00:39:43,376 --> 00:39:45,196
[Colliding into each other
at the halfway mark.]

726
00:39:46,763 --> 00:39:48,301
Just turn around and avoid him.

727
00:39:52,936 --> 00:39:54,748
[Go away!]

728
00:39:59,441 --> 00:40:01,502
[The incident at the halfway mark
made a difference in the competition.]

729
00:40:04,197 --> 00:40:06,421
[Goal!]

730
00:40:10,742 --> 00:40:14,921
<i>I love Jong Kook's thick arms.</i>

731
00:40:14,922 --> 00:40:18,156
[Team Running Man's Muscle Boy wins!]

732
00:40:19,529 --> 00:40:22,267
Did you see how Jong Kook scooted
himself up there?

733
00:40:22,513 --> 00:40:24,384
I really couldn't stand the sight of him.

734
00:40:27,171 --> 00:40:29,270
Team Running Man just won themselves
an order of rockfish sushi.

735
00:40:29,271 --> 00:40:30,981
[Team Running Man wins the rockfish sushi.]

736
00:40:33,007 --> 00:40:36,477
[The final play-off game.]

737
00:40:36,478 --> 00:40:38,455
- The thick noodle soup?
- Thick clamshell noodle soup.

738
00:40:39,369 --> 00:40:42,573
[Their final menu item selection is,
clamshell thick noodle soup.]

739
00:40:45,006 --> 00:40:47,229
<i>The game you'll be playing for
clamshell thick noodle soup is...</i>

740
00:40:47,930 --> 00:40:49,802
<i>the hand slap game.</i>

741
00:40:49,803 --> 00:40:51,577
[The final game- Hand slap game.]

742
00:40:51,578 --> 00:40:52,578
This?

743
00:40:52,579 --> 00:40:55,976
The team who gets in the most
number of slaps wins the game.

744
00:40:55,977 --> 00:40:57,269
[The team that gets in the most number
of slaps wins the game.]

745
00:40:57,270 --> 00:40:59,297
We want to be the one to
avoid the slaps first.

746
00:40:59,298 --> 00:41:01,108
Why?
We just won the last game.

747
00:41:02,936 --> 00:41:05,744
['Mr. Kim-Leave it' who just can't
let anything go easily.]

748
00:41:06,827 --> 00:41:09,025
- What? I was making a comment.
- Let's decide with Rock, paper, scissors.

749
00:41:09,026 --> 00:41:11,036
He's gotten so weird since
the last time we saw him.

750
00:41:13,095 --> 00:41:15,142
I'll go first.
I'll go first with this.

751
00:41:15,143 --> 00:41:16,928
[Team Shinhwa- Andy.]

752
00:41:16,929 --> 00:41:18,589
Let's eat the clamshell thick noodle soup.

753
00:41:19,206 --> 00:41:21,926
- Don't you have to have your hand out?
- I will once we start the game.

754
00:41:22,475 --> 00:41:24,109
Okay, I'll say it.
Set, go.

755
00:41:26,706 --> 00:41:28,051
It's really going to hurt if you get slapped.

756
00:41:28,052 --> 00:41:29,793
[What they need is the right timing.]

757
00:41:30,305 --> 00:41:31,606
He's not putting
his hands together close enough.

758
00:41:35,075 --> 00:41:36,240
I am putting my hands together.

759
00:41:36,241 --> 00:41:37,819
Suk Jin is going to go first.

760
00:41:38,268 --> 00:41:40,320
[Huh?]

761
00:41:40,321 --> 00:41:41,645
What are you doing?

762
00:41:41,646 --> 00:41:44,831
[Getting annoyed with how long
Andy is taking.]

763
00:41:45,866 --> 00:41:47,578
You're getting annoyed, aren't you?

764
00:41:48,430 --> 00:41:51,038
[This is Team Shinhwa's plan-
To annoy to the point of exhaustion.]

765
00:41:51,039 --> 00:41:52,033
Yes, until you're exhausted.

766
00:41:52,034 --> 00:41:53,979
Suk Jin's speed will start to
slow down as the game drags on.

767
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:56,284
I can do this all night.

768
00:42:04,391 --> 00:42:07,944
[A strategic win- Score one for Andy.]

769
00:42:08,852 --> 00:42:10,146
One point for Andy.

770
00:42:10,147 --> 00:42:12,090
[Big-nosed Brother
flabbergasted at his loss.]

771
00:42:15,179 --> 00:42:18,160
[Yoo Hyuk taking it upon himself
to step into the game.]

772
00:42:18,161 --> 00:42:20,812
- Set, go.
- You have to stay on your toes.

773
00:42:20,813 --> 00:42:21,994
Set, go.

774
00:42:26,066 --> 00:42:27,856
[Eyes wide open.]

775
00:42:30,377 --> 00:42:32,223
Aren't I fast?
I can go even faster.

776
00:42:33,279 --> 00:42:34,838
[Even with his fast hand movements,
his mouth doesn't know to slow down.]

777
00:42:34,839 --> 00:42:37,205
You're losing your strength.
Take a quick break.

778
00:42:37,206 --> 00:42:38,526
What are you doing?

779
00:42:38,527 --> 00:42:40,253
[Casually relaxed.]

780
00:42:42,641 --> 00:42:44,355
How long do I have to do this for?

781
00:42:46,454 --> 00:42:47,921
That's their strategy.

782
00:42:50,285 --> 00:42:51,581
What the heck?

783
00:42:54,674 --> 00:42:56,636
[Loses to Andy again...]

784
00:42:56,637 --> 00:42:58,288
What did I tell you?

785
00:43:00,632 --> 00:43:03,822
[Andy- Two wins in a row.]

786
00:43:04,263 --> 00:43:06,303
You're much worse than Kwang Soo
when it comes to taking cheap shots.

787
00:43:06,683 --> 00:43:08,320
You have no right
to say anything to me anymore!

788
00:43:08,321 --> 00:43:09,845
That's the first time I've done
something like that.

789
00:43:09,846 --> 00:43:12,318
It's because I'm on the show.
I'm not normally like that.

790
00:43:12,319 --> 00:43:13,382
Okay, Jong Kook.

791
00:43:13,383 --> 00:43:15,491
[Muscle Boy, Kkuk's turn.]

792
00:43:16,173 --> 00:43:18,057
[Playing mental games by showing off
how fast his hand moves are.]

793
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:24,075
No, I don't have to have my hands together
since we haven't started the game yet.

794
00:43:24,511 --> 00:43:26,839
He even knows how to play
gonggi with those thick arms of his.

795
00:43:27,828 --> 00:43:31,123
[King of sneak attack, Andy...
Will he be able to beat Kkuk as well?]

796
00:43:31,981 --> 00:43:34,389
[Huh?]

797
00:43:36,278 --> 00:43:39,256
[Unbelievable!]

798
00:43:40,608 --> 00:43:41,845
What is he doing?

799
00:43:43,667 --> 00:43:46,033
[Amazing speed.]

800

Come on!

803
00:44:02,122 --> 00:44:03,480
Come on, and hit me.

804
00:44:03,892 --> 00:44:06,423
My stomach hurts.
All this laughing is making my stomach hurt.

805
00:44:07,823 --> 00:44:10,309
[Muscle Boy's slicing moves are
catching in popularity.]

806
00:44:10,310 --> 00:44:11,449
He looks like the village idiot.

807
00:44:12,630 --> 00:44:13,852
Hurry up and come on.

808
00:44:15,810 --> 00:44:18,079
[Mr. One-piece lasting longer
than anyone else.]

809
00:44:18,994 --> 00:44:20,088
Set, go.

810
00:44:23,122 --> 00:44:25,062
[Come on!]

811
00:44:26,050 --> 00:44:27,792
I love the expression on his face.

812
00:44:29,302 --> 00:44:32,059
- One-piece!
- Okay, come on.

813
00:44:33,905 --> 00:44:35,806
[He knows no exhaustion.]

814
00:44:42,512 --> 00:44:43,632
Hey!

815
00:44:44,175 --> 00:44:45,343
Hey!

816
00:44:45,344 --> 00:44:47,850
[Succeeds in his plan to annoy Jong Kook.]

817
00:44:49,842 --> 00:44:51,517
Hey, are you going to do it or not?

818
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:54,277
[One-piece Muscle Boy on fire.]

819
00:44:54,278 --> 00:44:57,629
- How is it that you're lasting that long?
- Your arms are all pumped up right now.

820
00:44:59,883 --> 00:45:01,651
My arms are about to explode.

821
00:45:01,652 --> 00:45:03,953
Look at how sweaty I am right now.

822
00:45:04,834 --> 00:45:07,028
- You have one minute on the clock.
- One minute?

823
00:45:07,532 --> 00:45:08,821
You're doing good, Jong Kook.

824
00:45:08,822 --> 00:45:09,953
Set, go.

825
00:45:13,262 --> 00:45:15,194
[Can't even see his hands...]

826

[Kkuk gritting down on his teeth.]

827
00:45:19,322 --> 00:45:21,567
One minute.
You have 40 seconds to go.

828
00:45:21,568 --> 00:45:24,415
[Fast hand movement to ensure
that he doesn't get slapped.]

829

[Starting to slow down...]

830
00:45:31,077 --> 00:45:34,502
[Crazy pumping movements.]

831
00:45:36,067 --> 00:45:37,583
What in the world are you doing right now?

832
00:45:41,651 --> 00:45:43,374
- You didn't hit me!
- Yes, I did!

833
00:45:44,334 --> 00:45:48,306
He didn't hit me!
Why don't you check on camera.

834
00:45:48,307 --> 00:45:50,082
I swear that you didn't hit me.

835
00:45:50,083 --> 00:45:51,762
[Sweat soaked.]

836
00:45:51,763 --> 00:45:54,274
- You move so fast.
- That wasn't easy.

837
00:45:54,275 --> 00:45:57,173
[Unable to make an accurate call.
Still 33 seconds left on the clock.]

838
00:45:57,174 --> 00:45:59,433
[The longest minute in history.]

839
00:45:59,921 --> 00:46:01,839
- Set, go.
- 33 seconds.

840
00:46:09,687 --> 00:46:12,843
[Obsessive dusting of the hands.]

841
00:46:14,234 --> 00:46:17,063
[Hand dusting movements
starting to slow down.]

842
00:46:18,683 --> 00:46:20,139
15 seconds.
You've only got 15 seconds.

843
00:46:24,722 --> 00:46:27,613
[Andy eyeing for his moment.]

844
00:46:27,614 --> 00:46:32,398
Five, four, three, two...

845
00:46:35,673 --> 00:46:38,193
[Pumping Kkuk wins!]

846
00:46:44,382 --> 00:46:46,220
But it still feels like we've won.

847
00:46:49,510 --> 00:46:51,776
That was a really nice effort.

848
00:46:53,032 --> 00:46:56,962
- I can't even lift up my arms right now.
- You should make a fitness video.

849
00:46:57,846 --> 00:46:59,697
This is a very good workout, everyone.

850
00:46:59,698 --> 00:47:01,642
I'm serious. Do it as
fast as you can for a full minute.

851
00:47:01,643 --> 00:47:03,586
[One minute on the clock-
Kkuk's hand dusting exercise.]

852
00:47:04,921 --> 00:47:09,863
Director, can you produce a music video
for Jong Kook with his hand exercise?

853
00:47:09,864 --> 00:47:14,072
- What did you say?
- This move... let's see it how it plays out.

854
00:47:14,073 --> 00:47:17,047
Jong Kook's... music video!

855
00:47:17,048 --> 00:47:18,086
[Jong Kook's music video- Start.]

856
00:47:24,067 --> 00:47:29,660
[I love Jong Kook's thick arms- Music video.
Song about his never tiring muscles.]

857
00:47:35,444 --> 00:47:36,934
- Yes!
- At last!

858
00:47:36,935 --> 00:47:39,084
[Time to switch it up-
Team Running Man's turn to attack.]

859
00:47:39,085 --> 00:47:40,229
One minute on the clock?

860
00:47:40,264 --> 00:47:41,860
- What am I doing?
- You're doing the slapping.

861
00:47:41,861 --> 00:47:43,279
[Attacker this time is,
Mr. Random Capable, Gary.]

862
00:47:43,314 --> 00:47:44,402
- We need our noodle soup.
- I know.

863
00:47:44,403 --> 00:47:45,947
- We need the noodle soup.
- I really want to eat it.

864
00:47:45,948 --> 00:47:47,008
[Andy, now on the defense.]

865
00:47:53,065 --> 00:47:54,821
Just leave him alone.

866
00:47:54,822 --> 00:47:57,610
Just leave him.
Let him tire himself out.

867
00:47:59,919 --> 00:48:01,988
[Slowly starting to show his exhaustion.]

868
00:48:04,479 --> 00:48:05,754
It's okay.
Just let him go.

869
00:48:06,279 --> 00:48:08,044
[Total concentration.]

870
00:48:09,869 --> 00:48:11,253
How much time is left on the clock?

871
00:48:12,803 --> 00:48:14,798
He's really annoying me.

872
00:48:15,983 --> 00:48:18,544
[Whether he's on the offense or defense,
Andy is the King of annoyance.]

873
00:48:18,545 --> 00:48:19,929
There's 20 second left on the clock.

874
00:48:32,463 --> 00:48:34,814
[Humiliated-
Hand on fire, and face on fire.]

875
00:48:37,491 --> 00:48:39,451
I think I dragged it out for too long.

876
00:48:40,308 --> 00:48:41,983
It's Eric.

877
00:48:41,984 --> 00:48:43,795
[Team Shinhwa's next player is,
their black hole, Eric.]

878
00:48:43,796 --> 00:48:46,554
I can't believe how different they look from
one another when they're of the same origin.

879
00:48:46,555 --> 00:48:48,438
[Weird looking man vs. Beautiful looking man.]

880
00:48:48,439 --> 00:48:49,731
Fighting!

881
00:48:50,957 --> 00:48:53,421
[Gary on the attack!]

882
00:48:57,832 --> 00:48:59,865
[Huh?]

883
00:49:00,404 --> 00:49:02,373
[Over before the first second is even up.]

884
00:49:05,050 --> 00:49:06,272
Gary's too quick.

885
00:49:07,100 --> 00:49:08,911
[As expected,
he coolly accepts the outcome.]

886
00:49:09,158 --> 00:49:12,596
When I saw the glint in Eric's eyes,
I thought he was going to be really good.

887
00:49:12,597 --> 00:49:14,105
But what's the deal, Eric?

888
00:49:14,106 --> 00:49:16,726
But I really love how quick and cool
he is about accepting the outcome.

889
00:49:18,139 --> 00:49:19,981
[The final round.]

890
00:49:19,982 --> 00:49:22,150
[If Jun Jin avoids being slapped,
then it's Team Shinhwa's win.]

891
00:49:22,151 --> 00:49:23,902
Let's eat the clamshell noodle soup.

892
00:49:25,537 --> 00:49:28,317
- I'm going to do this.
- We can't lose to him.

893
00:49:31,818 --> 00:49:33,669
He's reminding me of Jong Kook
right now.

894
00:49:36,555 --> 00:49:40,529
[Unlike any other players thus far,
his movements are adding more nervousness.]

895
00:49:51,345 --> 00:49:53,501
I can't believe Jong Kook
did that for five minutes.

896
00:49:53,502 --> 00:49:55,822
[It's understandable why his arms are so big.]

897
00:49:58,380 --> 00:50:00,164
[Ten seconds left on the clock!]

898
00:50:01,394 --> 00:50:03,887
[Jun Jin on his own unusual rhythm.]

899
00:50:05,149 --> 00:50:06,813
[Five seconds left on the clock!]

900
00:50:08,348 --> 00:50:10,526
[The winner will be determined
within the next five seconds!]

901
00:50:10,527 --> 00:50:13,974
[Who will be the victor of this game?]

902
00:50:22,504 --> 00:50:24,852
[Gary fails at his attack!]

903
00:50:24,853 --> 00:50:29,463
[Team Shinhwa wins the
Pirate Restaurant mission!]

904
00:50:30,879 --> 00:50:33,652
[Shinhwa's still got it.]

905
00:50:33,653 --> 00:50:34,836
What is it?

906
00:50:36,416 --> 00:50:40,832
Team Shinhwa will win
the clamshell noodle soup.

907
00:50:41,190 --> 00:50:42,719
Thank you for this wonderful meal.

908
00:50:46,458 --> 00:50:50,278
[Spicy chicken soup to start off the meal.]

909
00:50:51,088 --> 00:50:52,980
There's the clamshell noodle soup.

910
00:50:54,245 --> 00:50:57,496
[Here's the clamshell noodle soup.]

911
00:51:02,102 --> 00:51:03,497
This broth is amazing.

912
00:51:04,788 --> 00:51:06,769
I really want some.

913
00:51:06,770 --> 00:51:08,974
The spicy chicken is amazing.

914
00:51:08,975 --> 00:51:10,645
I think this spicy chicken is the best.

915
00:51:18,262 --> 00:51:19,486
Why is everything going over
to that other table?

916
00:51:22,594 --> 00:51:23,673
It's the blue crab soup.

917
00:51:23,674 --> 00:51:25,888
[Even the blue crab soup!]

918
00:51:35,654 --> 00:51:38,302
- We'll take our hint now.
- We're getting the bad hint again?

919
00:51:38,303 --> 00:51:40,353
[Team Shinhwa earns another solid hint.]

920
00:51:41,612 --> 00:51:44,498
[Team Running Man wins themselves
another ambiguous hint.]

921
00:51:45,287 --> 00:51:50,339
<i>[Yellow parasol.]</i>

922
00:51:50,632 --> 00:51:53,413
[The undead?
A yellow parasol?]

923
00:51:55,790 --> 00:51:58,082
['At the top of the roof _______.'
This is a hint?]

924
00:51:59,536 --> 00:52:01,062
This hint is way too hard.

925
00:52:04,854 --> 00:52:07,479
[Must find 'that place' on the rooftop.]

926
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:10,482
[The only solution to lifting the
secret of the curse is at 'that place'.]

927
00:52:11,473 --> 00:52:15,668
[A quite beach- Shinhwa vs. Running Man.
What's the next game that awaits them?]

928
00:52:15,669 --> 00:52:17,185
Okay, everyone.

929
00:52:17,186 --> 00:52:20,210
Your next mission...
is the battle of strength.

930
00:52:20,245 --> 00:52:22,935
[The battle of strength!]

931
00:52:22,936 --> 00:52:25,748
This is a classic water game.

932
00:52:26,093 --> 00:52:28,258
You'll be playing,
the Water Shoving Game.

933
00:52:28,259 --> 00:52:29,691
[A classic water game-
Water Shoving Game.]

934
00:52:29,692 --> 00:52:34,302
- Against Jong Kook?
- You guys are all strong and in good shape.

935
00:52:34,303 --> 00:52:37,167
I think it's been about seven to eight years
since the last time we did this.

936
00:52:37,965 --> 00:52:41,141
- Then give us one extra player.
- No, it's not going to be that bad.

937
00:52:41,142 --> 00:52:42,397
[Five people vs. Seven people.]

938
00:52:42,398 --> 00:52:44,930
- Since they have a woman on their team...
- What woman?

939
00:52:45,334 --> 00:52:48,534
- Ji Hyo. Ji Hyo's a woman.
- I know how strong Ji Hyo is myself.

940
00:52:48,535 --> 00:52:52,665
But you guys are beating us
two to zero right now.

941
00:52:52,666 --> 00:52:55,707
Then let us take Ji Hyo and
we'll give you Eric.

942
00:52:57,231 --> 00:52:58,949
- I agree with that suggestion.
- What did you say?

943
00:53:00,824 --> 00:53:03,357
These guys are like professionals.

944
00:53:03,358 --> 00:53:04,436
[Real battle of their strength!
Prepare yourselves for what's to come.]

945
00:53:04,471 --> 00:53:05,987
This battle will be fought five against five.

946
00:53:05,988 --> 00:53:08,876
[Water shove battle- Round one.
Five against five.]

947
00:53:08,877 --> 00:53:12,514
- That's not going to be an even fight.
- How about Six against five?

948
00:53:13,211 --> 00:53:15,353
[I guess they really are afraid of Shinhwa.]

949
00:53:15,354 --> 00:53:17,710
If you want it to be six against five,
you have to get your opponents to agree.

950
00:53:17,711 --> 00:53:20,309
It's not fair to us,
so let's just do it like that.

951
00:53:20,310 --> 00:53:21,969
- Six against five.
- Okay, fine. We'll allow it.

952
00:53:21,970 --> 00:53:24,292
- Okay, then you're agreeing to 6 against 5.
- Let's just get on with it.

953
00:53:24,660 --> 00:53:27,489
[They're just happy with their decision.]

954
00:53:30,146 --> 00:53:32,128
Since we're being nice to you guys,
invite us onto the show more often.

955
00:53:32,129 --> 00:53:33,861
Of course.
You're invited to come anytime.

956
00:53:33,861 --> 00:53:35,635
[Knows how to get along
with Running Man members?]

957
00:53:35,636 --> 00:53:37,782
- Invite us on often.
- Guys from back in the day!

958
00:53:39,081 --> 00:53:42,397
- First, I ask that you all play it safe.
- Yes, don't worry about that.

959
00:53:42,398 --> 00:53:44,758
Even though it's six against five,
let's play like it's even and fair.

960
00:53:44,759 --> 00:53:45,903
I understand.

961
00:53:45,904 --> 00:53:50,176
[Pride of Running Man is on the line-
We have to win this battle!]

962
00:53:50,410 --> 00:53:52,932
[We've been winning every mission!
We won't lose this time around either!]

963
00:53:53,645 --> 00:53:55,811
[Water shoving match- Round one.]

964
00:54:00,439 --> 00:54:02,493
[Andy is on the forefront for Team Shinhwa.]

965
00:54:04,445 --> 00:54:06,181
Okay, I got it.
Don't push me.

966
00:54:06,182 --> 00:54:07,399
Stop pushing me!

967
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:09,821
[The brotherly love of shoving one of their
members forward as a sacrificial lamb.]

968
00:54:16,975 --> 00:54:19,170
[Andy attacks!]

969
00:54:21,700 --> 00:54:24,461
[Gary changes his direction.]

970
00:54:27,084 --> 00:54:28,563
[Andy's attack fails miserably.]

971
00:54:29,741 --> 00:54:32,241
[Team Shinhwa's Andy- Out!]

972
00:54:32,555 --> 00:54:33,710
[Oh my goodness...]

973
00:54:37,084 --> 00:54:39,676
[Jun Jin also fails his attack against Gary!]

974
00:54:41,498 --> 00:54:42,854
I can't believe that just happened.

975
00:54:44,714 --> 00:54:48,531
- You're doing great, Gary!
- Suk Jin. Let Suk Jin show us what he's got.

976
00:54:48,532 --> 00:54:50,678
Let me get out there. Their
physical strength is right at my level.

977
00:54:52,051 --> 00:54:53,526
Let's do this while standing.

978
00:54:53,527 --> 00:54:55,713
[Team Shinhwa's Min Woo vs.
Team Running Man's Big-nose.]

979
00:55:01,205 --> 00:55:02,837
[Rest comfortably.]

980
00:55:09,282 --> 00:55:11,623
[It's Kwang Soo to the front line this time.]

981
00:55:22,682 --> 00:55:24,553
[A water slap to the face!]

982
00:55:24,554 --> 00:55:26,810
[Team Running Man's Giraffe
is also eliminated.]

983
00:55:27,765 --> 00:55:29,809
- Get in there, Jae Suk.
- Fighting.

984
00:55:29,810 --> 00:55:32,325
[Team Shinhwa- Three people vs.
Team Running Man- Four people.]

985
00:55:32,326 --> 00:55:33,583
Okay, here I come.

986
00:55:33,584 --> 00:55:36,266
- Okay, come on then.
- Are you serious?

987
00:55:36,267 --> 00:55:37,607
Because I really am coming.

988
00:55:37,608 --> 00:55:39,241
[No way to take back his words now.]

989
00:55:40,315 --> 00:55:41,820
One, two, three.

990
00:55:43,036 --> 00:55:44,852
Why are you going by what they say?

991
00:55:45,854 --> 00:55:47,843
[You're right, why am I doing that?]

992
00:55:48,711 --> 00:55:51,678
[Almost fell for Team Shinhwa's plans.]

993
00:55:53,281 --> 00:55:54,742
[I can't fall for their tricks.]

994
00:55:54,743 --> 00:55:57,663
- One, two, three.
- Why are you listening to them?

995
00:55:57,664 --> 00:55:59,972
- We'll just stay here.
- You can just come to us.

996
00:56:00,705 --> 00:56:02,476
[Attack!]

997
00:56:06,834 --> 00:56:09,452
[Total chaos.]

998
00:56:12,785 --> 00:56:14,835
[Gary and Min Woo fall in simultaneously.]

999
00:56:18,097 --> 00:56:19,603
[It's absolute chaos on the water float.]

1000
00:56:24,350 --> 00:56:26,218
[Ha Ha falls victim to chaos and
gets dumped in the water.]

1001
00:56:27,237 --> 00:56:30,065
[Jae Suk and Jong Kook vs. Eric and Hye Sung.
It's two against two!]

1002
00:56:30,066 --> 00:56:31,367
Jong Kook!

1003
00:56:31,368 --> 00:56:33,232
You have to beat them!

1004
00:56:35,747 --> 00:56:38,321
Jong Kook is like a raging bull!
He's a total bull!

1005
00:56:38,965 --> 00:56:41,615
[Scary bull, Kkuk
charging in on his opponents.]

1006
00:56:44,147 --> 00:56:45,530
Come with me, Jong Kook!

1007
00:56:45,531 --> 00:56:47,202
[Just then, Hye Sung and Jae Suk...]

1008
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:49,213
[All four of them...]

1009
00:56:49,214 --> 00:56:51,886
[Simultaneously...]

1010
00:56:54,753 --> 00:56:58,114
[Round one- Invalid.]

1011
00:56:58,115 --> 00:56:59,959
- What happened?
- We won, right?

1012
00:57:00,673 --> 00:57:04,115
[Eric's surprising sneak attack.]

1013
00:57:05,355 --> 00:57:07,050
See? Even 6 against 5,
it's still an even fight.

1014
00:57:07,051 --> 00:57:09,109
Six against five is an even fight.

1015
00:57:09,110 --> 00:57:10,678
[Needs all six of them in the fight
for the fight to be an even match.]

1016
00:57:10,679 --> 00:57:13,228
You should've sacrificed yourself earlier.
Why would you stick it out instead?

1017
00:57:13,229 --> 00:57:15,252
- What are you talking about?
- I could shoved both of them in earlier!

1018
00:57:15,287 --> 00:57:16,709
But I wasn't able to do that
because you were in the way.

1019
00:57:16,710 --> 00:57:20,018
I was holding onto them for you
so that you could attack from behind.

1020
00:57:20,019 --> 00:57:22,134
When it's time for you to die,
just hurry up and die, okay?

1021
00:57:23,069 --> 00:57:24,845
Why do we always have to die for you?

1022
00:57:25,703 --> 00:57:28,532
[Yoo Hyuk and Big-nose always
in charge of sacrificing themselves?]

1023
00:57:29,935 --> 00:57:32,612
[Current score- 0:0.
Back to round one!]

1024
00:57:32,613 --> 00:57:33,870
Fighting.

1025
00:57:35,365 --> 00:57:36,928
The referee is really cute.

1026
00:57:36,929 --> 00:57:39,797
- Are you cheering for Shinhwa right now?
- Is it us or Shinhwa?

1027
00:57:39,798 --> 00:57:42,357
- I'm cheering for our team.
- Gary thinks that you're being really cute.

1028
00:57:42,358 --> 00:57:44,106
[The referee is totally my style.]

[This time, it's zombie style attack.]

1032
00:58:00,288 --> 00:58:03,041
[Checking each other out like a couple of
zombies to start off the round.]

1033
00:58:05,971 --> 00:58:07,218
Let's just attack him.

1034
00:58:07,964 --> 00:58:09,264
Get rid of them.
Just sacrifice Suk Jin.

1035
00:58:09,265 --> 00:58:11,417
- Sacrifice Suk Jin?
- How can you say that?

1036
00:58:11,418 --> 00:58:13,626
[Big-nosed Brother explodes in
hurt disappointment at his words.]

1037
00:58:18,092 --> 00:58:19,924
[What?]

1038
00:58:22,946 --> 00:58:25,108
[Jae Suk is uselessly eliminated.]

1039
00:58:25,528 --> 00:58:27,605
[Hye Sung takes advantage of the confusion
to spring an ambush attack.]

1040
00:58:27,670 --> 00:58:29,594
Now's the chance.
You have to get up there now!

1041
00:58:30,150 --> 00:58:32,777
[Jun Jin and Andy attacks simultaneously!]

1042
00:58:36,332 --> 00:58:38,894
[The whole group falls in together!]

1043
00:58:39,721 --> 00:58:42,536
[Min Woo, Hye Sung, Suk Jin, Gary, and
Kwang Soo all fall in the water together!]

1044
00:58:42,851 --> 00:58:44,038
I'm scared!

1045
00:58:47,370 --> 00:58:49,533
[Jun Jin decides to retreat for now.]

1046
00:58:51,357 --> 00:58:54,167
Ha Ha, you need to stop pushing me
whenever you feel like you're in danger.

1047
00:58:54,168 --> 00:58:56,263
- Why do you keep pushing me?
- Because I got scared.

1048
00:58:56,315 --> 00:58:57,964
You almost made me fall in the water.

1049
00:58:58,337 --> 00:59:02,425
[Jun Jin vs. Jong Kook.
A one on one face-off.]

1050
00:59:02,426 --> 00:59:04,363
Okay, our two warriors.

1051
00:59:04,364 --> 00:59:06,172
Let's see who wins this battle.

1052
00:59:07,993 --> 00:59:10,267
Why do you keep letting go?
Why do you keep letting go of my hand?

1053
00:59:13,224 --> 00:59:16,053
[The battle between The Bull and The Ox.]

1054
00:59:29,955 --> 00:59:31,452
[Jong Kook twists his body around
so that only Jun Jin is eliminated.]

1055
00:59:31,966 --> 00:59:36,022
[Min Woo and Eric have no other choice
but to join in on the attack.]

1056
00:59:38,662 --> 00:59:40,769
[Jong Kook still manages to eliminate
Min Woo in the midst of all the chaos!]

1057
00:59:44,573 --> 00:59:46,905
[Final survivors-
Eric vs. Jong Kook and Ha Ha.]

1058
00:59:47,850 --> 00:59:51,187
[Eric vs. Jong Kook-
Battle of their strengths.]

1059
00:59:56,611 --> 00:59:58,235
[Haroro]

1060
00:59:58,236 --> 01:00:00,077
[Becomes the victor
without doing any of the work!]

1061

- He didn't even do anything.
- I did it!

1062
01:00:04,949 --> 01:00:08,282
I'm... the ultimate victor!

1063
01:00:08,283 --> 01:00:10,624
- All you did was just stand there.
- I shoved them in the water!

1064
01:00:10,758 --> 01:00:12,961
[Current score-
Team Shinhwa- 0: Team Running Man- 1.]

1065
01:00:13,843 --> 01:00:16,723
For the next round of the game,
it'll be five against five.

1066
01:00:16,724 --> 01:00:20,062
If Team Running Man wins this round,
that's the end of this game.

1067
01:00:20,063 --> 01:00:21,249
[Best out of three.
If Team RM wins, then it's game over.]

1068
01:00:21,250 --> 01:00:23,209
- Okay.
- This could be the last round!

1069
01:00:23,210 --> 01:00:24,665
- Okay!
- Okay, let's go!

1070
01:00:26,434 --> 01:00:30,085
- Let's go.
- Okay... set, go!

1071
01:00:30,086 --> 01:00:31,930
[Water shoving match- Round Three.]

1072
01:00:35,404 --> 01:00:36,982
You can't be sitting up there
with your legs crossed like that!

1073
01:00:36,983 --> 01:00:38,783
What are you doing?

1074
01:00:39,738 --> 01:00:42,386
How about Jong Kook and I?
Palm to palm shoving.

1075
01:00:43,255 --> 01:00:45,554
- Why me?
- That's a pretty good idea.

1076
01:00:45,919 --> 01:00:49,552
[Andy requesting a battle of strength
against the almighty Mr. Capable?]

1077
01:00:49,553 --> 01:00:51,115
- Do it.
- Show him what you're made of!

1078
01:00:51,116 --> 01:00:53,011
Jong kook's really good at that.

1079

[A manly one on one battle?]

1080
01:00:55,199 --> 01:00:56,403
Okay, let's stand face to face.

[Team Shinhwa wins!]

1090
01:01:35,639 --> 01:01:38,114
So you're going to cheat your
way to victory?

1091
01:01:39,380 --> 01:01:41,770
Hey, Lee Kwang Soo!
This is all your fault!

1092
01:01:42,562 --> 01:01:45,356
[Andy having learned his bad habits
from the traitorous Giraffe?]

1093
01:01:48,887 --> 01:01:51,728
[Submerges himself in the water
out of his happiness over their win.]

1094
01:01:53,591 --> 01:01:57,385
[Shinhwa's tactical deception that takes
even the traitorous Giraffe by surprise.]

1095
01:01:57,386 --> 01:02:00,287
- This is how you do it though.
- Okay, this is how we're going to play?

1096
01:02:00,322 --> 01:02:02,890
I don't know how, but my face
touched the ground when I fell in the water.

1097
01:02:03,767 --> 01:02:05,487
How in the world did that happen?

1098
01:02:06,987 --> 01:02:08,693
Look at all the sand on my face.

1099
01:02:10,081 --> 01:02:12,214
Okay, this will be five against five again.

1100
01:02:12,752 --> 01:02:14,415
We really have to win it this time.

1101
01:02:14,416 --> 01:02:16,060
This is the last round.

1102
01:02:16,061 --> 01:02:18,897
Yes, this will be the final competition.

1103
01:02:18,898 --> 01:02:20,782
Yes, this is the decisive round.

1104
01:02:20,783 --> 01:02:24,154
[Water shoving match-
The final decisive round.]

1105
01:02:25,964 --> 01:02:27,924
- You're the king of cheating!
- Get him, Kwang Soo.

1106
01:02:27,925 --> 01:02:29,680
[King of cheating, Andy starts to
take cheap shots right off the bat.]

1107
01:02:32,216 --> 01:02:33,906
We have to win this so we can earn the hint.

1108
01:02:33,907 --> 01:02:36,536
- We don't have a single hint.
- Shinhwa already has two good hints.

1109
01:02:36,537 --> 01:02:39,197
To be honest, the hints that we have
aren't all that great either.

1110
01:02:39,198 --> 01:02:41,110
Then how do you think we felt
with the hints that we have?

1111
01:02:41,572 --> 01:02:43,370
[That's true...]

1112
01:02:45,380 --> 01:02:47,337
Look how they're all posed together.
It's like they're posing for a picture.

1113
01:02:47,338 --> 01:02:49,718
- What are you saying over there?
- I said, you all look very picturesque.

1114
01:02:50,009 --> 01:02:52,967
[Now that they're thinking about it,
Shinhwa also gets into the pose mode.]

1115
01:02:52,968 --> 01:02:55,897
[The focus of their pose are
their arms that are sticking straight out!]

1116
01:02:57,279 --> 01:03:00,332
They are... Shinhwa!

1117
01:03:00,985 --> 01:03:04,742
[We are Shinhwa!]

1118
01:03:04,743 --> 01:03:07,205
I don't know why we were always sticking our
arms out like that during our days, right?

1119
01:03:07,206 --> 01:03:09,125
While staring at the camera like this.

1120
01:03:09,650 --> 01:03:11,976
[The popular idol pose of
back in their days.]

1121
01:03:13,533 --> 01:03:15,714
Bee, bee!
There's a bee, Jae Suk.

1122
01:03:15,715 --> 01:03:17,655
- It's okay.
- It's a bee!

1123
01:03:19,264 --> 01:03:21,092
[Frightened out of their minds.]

1124
01:03:21,093 --> 01:03:23,422
[All these manly men freaking out
over one single bee.]

1125
01:03:24,092 --> 01:03:25,641
We're going to make you
shake in your shoes!

1126
01:03:29,487 --> 01:03:32,145
[The two warriors of strength from each team
facing off with one another again.]

1127
01:03:33,395 --> 01:03:35,039
[Kkuk the Ox...]

1128
01:03:35,040 --> 01:03:37,278
[vs. Jun Jin the Bull.]

1129
01:03:42,128 --> 01:03:45,682
[A battle with the pride of these two
men laid out on the line.]

1130
01:03:49,588 --> 01:03:51,076
So that you can't grab my shirt.

1131
01:03:51,077 --> 01:03:54,505
[So that his shirt won't get grabbed...
strike a sexy off the shoulder pose instead?]

1132
01:03:57,216 --> 01:03:58,298
I really don't like to get my shirt grabbed.

1133
01:03:58,299 --> 01:03:59,889
- Just take off your shirt!
- Don't do that!

1134
01:03:59,890 --> 01:04:01,176
- Just take it off.
- Hey, don't do it.

1135
01:04:02,629 --> 01:04:05,851
[The two rivals from way back in the day.]

1136
01:04:05,852 --> 01:04:09,173
To be honest, just like Ha Ha just said,
you two are...

1137
01:04:09,432 --> 01:04:11,916
[Jun Jin's sudden attack!]

1138
01:04:13,833 --> 01:04:17,562
[They were stuck together...]

1139
01:04:17,563 --> 01:04:19,668
[Jun Jin and Kwang Soo's simultaneous
plunge into the water.]

[Once Kwang Soo and Jun Jin are gone,
the only challenge Team RM has left to face?]

1141
01:04:22,486 --> 01:04:23,863
- Jong Kook.
- Yeah?

1142
01:04:23,864 --> 01:04:25,548
- One on one.
- What a joke.

1143
01:04:26,311 --> 01:04:28,051
One on one like a man!

1144
01:04:28,402 --> 01:04:31,434
[Yoo Hyuk accepts the challenge
in Mr. Capable's place.]

1145
01:04:32,003 --> 01:04:34,375
[Nerve-wracking just like the real play-offs.]

1146
01:04:39,796 --> 01:04:41,973
[On my goodness...]

1147
01:04:41,974 --> 01:04:44,433
No!
No!

1148
01:04:44,894 --> 01:04:47,611
[Wardrobe malfunction for Andy.]

1149
01:04:49,089 --> 01:04:51,161
[You dare do this to me?]

1150
01:04:52,104 --> 01:04:54,380
[Andy attacks bare chested!]

1151
01:05:02,884 --> 01:05:05,131

to an end in the blink of an eye!]

and Min Woo finishes up the rest!]

1156
01:05:30,913 --> 01:05:32,676
[But what is he doing?]

1157
01:05:33,037 --> 01:05:36,071
[Hye Sung slides into the water by
himself once everything is already over.]

1158
01:05:37,269 --> 01:05:38,784
What are you doing?

1159
01:05:40,672 --> 01:05:44,062
[Team Shinhwa brings down the game!]

1160
01:05:46,656 --> 01:05:53,034
And thus... Team Shinhwa also wins
the water shoving match!

1161
01:05:53,035 --> 01:05:55,220
- Seriously!
- I'm sick and tired of losing.

1162
01:05:55,221 --> 01:05:57,365
[For the first time in history,
Team Running Man loses three games in a row.]

1163
01:05:57,366 --> 01:06:00,266
- This feels weird.
- But why did we lose this round?

1164
01:06:00,267 --> 01:06:01,491
Why did all three of you fall in like that?

1165
01:06:01,492 --> 01:06:04,371
I couldn't grab him to stop him
because he didn't have a shirt on.

1166
01:06:04,733 --> 01:06:07,793
[Bare-chested Andy's attack that
no one could've done anything to stop.]

1167
01:06:10,128 --> 01:06:12,596
- This is really annoying.
- This is the first time ever in history.

1168
01:06:12,597 --> 01:06:14,603
Is this going to be a one shot kill
by our guest?

1169
01:06:14,604 --> 01:06:17,507
- We've never had this happen to us before.
- This is the first time it's ever happened.

1170
01:06:17,508 --> 01:06:21,427
['G, D, P, O' Go away, invincible immortal!]
[Running Man's ambiguous hint.]

1171
01:06:23,221 --> 01:06:26,822
[Team Shinhwa's good hint- 'Gold power!
Go away, you invincible immortal!']

1172
01:06:27,050 --> 01:06:29,581
- Okay, let's go.
- Let's go on to our final destination.

1173
01:06:30,270 --> 01:06:32,103
[All the hints have now been given out.]

1174
01:06:32,104 --> 01:06:36,013
[Off to the final location where
the curse of the gold can be lifted.]

1175
01:06:44,369 --> 01:06:46,822
[Will they be able to lift
the pirate's curse...]

1176
01:06:46,823 --> 01:06:51,189
[And get their gold back in
their possession?]

1177
01:06:52,009 --> 01:06:54,892
[One quiet village in Seungbongdo.]

1178
01:06:54,893 --> 01:06:56,822
- Which is the first clue?
- I think I know what it is.

1179
01:06:56,823 --> 01:07:00,264
<i>Steal the ___ from the undead.</i>

1180
01:07:00,265 --> 01:07:01,625
What does that mean?

1181
01:07:02,219 --> 01:07:05,725
<i>Steal the ___ from the undead,
and On top of the roof is _____.</i>

1182
01:07:06,395 --> 01:07:09,887
Everyone,
when a person never dies...

1183
01:07:10,486 --> 01:07:16,171
don't you think that means that maybe one
of the guys on the other team is invincible?

1184
01:07:16,172 --> 01:07:17,814
Yes, I think you may be right.

1185
01:07:17,815 --> 01:07:19,065
[One of the Shinhwa members
could be the undead?]

1186
01:07:19,066 --> 01:07:21,755
Which would mean that one member from
our team would also be the undead for them.

1187
01:07:21,756 --> 01:07:24,175
<i>G, D, P, O.</i>

1188
01:07:24,596 --> 01:07:27,725
- What could that stand for?
- Could it be related to the pirate ship?

1189
01:07:30,176 --> 01:07:32,181
G, D, P, O...

1190
01:07:32,182 --> 01:07:35,448
[Meanwhile, Team Shinhwa is studying the
three good clues that they have gained.]

1191
01:07:35,449 --> 01:07:36,727
Is that like a chant we have to say out loud?

1192
01:07:36,728 --> 01:07:38,774
Do we go up to the rooftop
to say the chant?

1193
01:07:38,775 --> 01:07:43,768
- That's what I think too.
- We have to guess who the undead is, right?

1194
01:07:43,769 --> 01:07:45,132
- Jong Kook, you think?
- Yeah, I think he's the undead.

1195
01:07:45,167 --> 01:07:48,570
[There's no doubt in their mind that
Mr. Capable would be the undead?]

1196
01:07:48,571 --> 01:07:51,328
Maybe that's what they wants us to think.
That Jong Kook would be the undead.

1197
01:07:51,329 --> 01:07:54,350
But since their rank was pretty important
in the previous mission to this...

1198
01:07:54,351 --> 01:07:56,545
[Then could it be Ji Hyo, who's
in the first place after last week?]

1199
01:07:57,223 --> 01:07:59,353
- Let's just take them on.
- Yeah, that's a good idea.

1200
01:07:59,354 --> 01:08:03,096
[No matter, Team Shinhwa is at an advantage
for knowing all three of the hints.]

1201
01:08:04,245 --> 01:08:07,583
[Who will be the one to lift the curse,
and win the gold?]

1202
01:08:07,584 --> 01:08:11,703
<i>[Put all the pieces of the hints together,
eliminate the name tag from the undead</i>

1203
01:08:11,704 --> 01:08:15,923
<i>and take the treasure chest
in order to lift the curse off the treasure.]</i>

1204
01:08:15,924 --> 01:08:20,292
We will now choose one of you who will have
the 'undead' label under your name tag.

1205
01:08:20,293 --> 01:08:25,795
[One person from each team will be stuck with
the 'undead' label underneath their name tag.]

1206
01:08:25,796 --> 01:08:31,423
[But there's no way for any one of them
to know if they are the chosen person.]

1207
01:08:31,424 --> 01:08:32,660
So what is it that we know so far?

1208
01:08:32,661 --> 01:08:35,271
We have to take something from the undead.

1209
01:08:35,465 --> 01:08:38,313
Then we have to climb up onto
the rooftop to shout out the chant.

1210
01:08:38,314 --> 01:08:41,558
That's the way for us to oust them.
It's not just all about the name tag.

1211
01:08:41,593 --> 01:08:42,825
Yeah, I think you're right.

1212
01:08:44,230 --> 01:08:46,850
- What is it they're going to come after?
- We've really got nothing on us.

1213
01:08:46,851 --> 01:08:49,323
So they're going to have to take
something that we have on us away from us?

1214
01:08:49,324 --> 01:08:51,075
[Trying to figure out what it is that
they need to take from the undead.]

1215
01:08:51,076 --> 01:08:52,349
Shoes.

1216
01:08:52,350 --> 01:08:53,873
- Shoes?
- Ah, shoes.

1217
01:08:54,349 --> 01:08:56,248
- You may be right, it could be shoes.
- It's shoes.

1218
01:08:56,463 --> 01:08:59,122
One thing that we all have on us
would be either clothes, or shoes.

1219
01:08:59,123 --> 01:09:00,791
- I think shoes may be right.
- Either shoes or a hat.

1220
01:09:00,792 --> 01:09:03,750
- Shoes are the heart of Running Man.
- That's right.

1221
01:09:03,751 --> 01:09:06,318
- I think that's what it is.
- Let's all tie our shoelaces really tight.

1222
01:09:06,319 --> 01:09:09,313
How do we know which rooftop it is
with so many rooftops around here?

1223
01:09:09,313 --> 01:09:11,028
I wonder if their hint is easier than ours?

1224
01:09:11,029 --> 01:09:14,724
- Is it a person with the yellow parasol?
- I saw a yellow parasol earlier.

1225
01:09:14,725 --> 01:09:16,440
[Team Shinhwa's on their way to
find the yellow parasol.]

1226
01:09:17,385 --> 01:09:21,519
[So many parasols around...
but they find the yellow parasol!]

1227
01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:22,903
Look, there's the yellow one.

1228
01:09:22,904 --> 01:09:25,337
Now that I look around,
there's a parasol up there too.

1229
01:09:25,758 --> 01:09:27,749
- I see them over there too.
- I see them everywhere.

1230
01:09:27,750 --> 01:09:30,008
[A village with an unusually large
number of parasols on their rooftops.]

1231
01:09:30,753 --> 01:09:32,175
I see them all over the place.

1232
01:09:32,176 --> 01:09:37,263
[Oh... Team Running Man guesses that it's
a certain colored parasol on the rooftop.]

1233
01:09:37,264 --> 01:09:38,563
There's one over there too.

1234
01:09:39,594 --> 01:09:42,906
[Team Running Man splitting up to find
whatever it is that's up on the rooftop.]

1235
01:09:42,907 --> 01:09:44,567
I feel like something is going to
jump out on us.

1236
01:09:49,265 --> 01:09:52,678
I'm not falling for that.
They could be trying to lure us in.

1237
01:09:52,679 --> 01:09:54,857
I already used that trick on them
about two years ago.

1238
01:09:55,387 --> 01:09:57,924
[Sense of ease overflowing
from these two veteran chasers.]

1239
01:09:58,998 --> 01:10:00,499
I'll lure them over.

1240
01:10:01,590 --> 01:10:03,141
Where are you going?

1241
01:10:03,861 --> 01:10:06,552
[Min Woo appears on scene to
lure them in.]

1242
01:10:06,553 --> 01:10:07,867
Where are you going, Min Woo?

1243
01:10:09,132 --> 01:10:11,557
- The plums on the trees look delicious.
- Really?

1244
01:10:12,667 --> 01:10:15,281
- I'm positive he's trying to lure us.
- I know.

1245
01:10:15,774 --> 01:10:18,412
I bet they're all waiting for us
behind that wall over there.

1246
01:10:18,413 --> 01:10:19,911
And look, there's Hye Sung now.

1247
01:10:19,912 --> 01:10:21,916
[All the members of Shinhwa are
closing in on them as predicted.]

1248
01:10:22,392 --> 01:10:24,923
There's nothing difficult to figure out here.
You're trying to eliminate our name tag, right?

1249
01:10:24,924 --> 01:10:26,717
- Do we just rip it off?
- That's right.

1250
01:10:32,184 --> 01:10:33,880
[Andy's ambush attack!]

1251
01:10:34,387 --> 01:10:37,667
[Gary twists his body around to
get his hands on Andy's name tag!]

1252
01:10:44,368 --> 01:10:46,604
[Gary succeeds in his counterattack!]

1253
01:10:47,671 --> 01:10:49,834
[Andy loses to Running Man's
experienced counterattack moves instead!]

1254
01:10:50,385 --> 01:10:55,967
[Could Andy be the undead member?]

1255
01:10:55,968 --> 01:10:57,496
There's nothing.

1256
01:10:57,497 --> 01:11:00,346
[Andy isn't the undead!]

1257
01:11:00,347 --> 01:11:02,989
[Team Shinhwa's Andy- Out!]

1258
01:11:02,990 --> 01:11:06,513
<i>Andy, out.
Andy, out.</i>

1259
01:11:07,091 --> 01:11:10,644
<i>Andy, out.
Andy, out.</i>

1260
01:11:13,149 --> 01:11:19,002
[Finding the undead is their priority!
Team Running Man into offense position!]

1261
01:11:19,192 --> 01:11:21,439
I feel like we're the ones
being chased after.

1262
01:11:25,739 --> 01:11:26,965
They scared me.

1263
01:11:27,790 --> 01:11:30,922
[Now that they've seen each other,
it's time for a face-off!]

1264
01:11:30,923 --> 01:11:31,960
Be careful.

1265
01:11:31,961 --> 01:11:33,865
- Should we go after Jae Suk first?
- Yes.

1266
01:11:34,786 --> 01:11:36,144
[Min Woo and Hye Sung surrounding
the two Running Man members.]

1267
01:11:36,145 --> 01:11:37,982
[Yoo Hyuk gets in a protective stance
of Blank Ji!]

1268
01:11:37,983 --> 01:11:39,382
[Danger!]

1269
01:11:40,139 --> 01:11:42,357
[Yoo Hyuk pulls a fast move to
escape from their dangerous moment.]

1270
01:11:43,481 --> 01:11:45,833
- Let's get them.
- Is this what we do?

1271
01:11:49,702 --> 01:11:53,419
[A ferocious two on two face-off.]

1272
01:11:56,051 --> 01:11:57,929
[Hye Sung showing his back off to them
to lure them into attacking him.]

1273
01:11:58,720 --> 01:12:01,073
[Just then!]

1274
01:12:07,989 --> 01:12:10,774
[Ace Ji Hyo eliminates
Hye Sung's name tag!]

1275
01:12:11,596 --> 01:12:14,142
[Could Hye Sung be the undead?]

1276
01:12:14,143 --> 01:12:16,077
[No, he isn't!]

1277
01:12:16,623 --> 01:12:18,238
I just got eliminated by a girl.

1278
01:12:18,239 --> 01:12:20,289
Why are you coming over to me?

1279
01:12:21,557 --> 01:12:24,168
[The neighborhood dog coming over
to offer comfort to Hye Sung.]

1280
01:12:24,169 --> 01:12:26,156
[Makes him feel even more pathetic...]

1281
01:12:26,157 --> 01:12:27,599
What are you doing over here?

1282
01:12:27,739 --> 01:12:30,233
[It's okay, Hye Sung.]

1283
01:12:30,234 --> 01:12:33,644
- Why is he coming over to me?
- Why are your guys just showing up now?

1284
01:12:34,078 --> 01:12:36,574
- Is Hye Sung ousted?
- Hye Sung's ousted.

1285
01:12:36,575 --> 01:12:40,599
<i>Shin Hye Sung, out.
Shin Hye Sung, out.</i>

1286
01:12:40,954 --> 01:12:42,754
- Did Ji Hyo eliminate me?
- Yeah, Ji Hyo did it.

1287
01:12:43,556 --> 01:12:45,447
Can't we just say that Jae Suk did it?

1288
01:12:45,448 --> 01:12:48,301
[We're sorry, but we
can't magically edit that out.]

1289
01:12:48,302 --> 01:12:50,379
- You did it, Ji Hyo.
- You have to take your friend, Hye Sung.

1290
01:12:51,253 --> 01:12:53,394
- He keeps following me around.
- Just go play with him while you wait.

1291
01:12:53,395 --> 01:12:55,156
[Stop with all that chattering,
and just follow me!]

1292
01:12:55,157 --> 01:12:57,021
- Just follow him.
- Where is he taking me?

1293
01:12:57,022 --> 01:12:58,583
Just follow that dog to jail.

1294
01:13:10,223 --> 01:13:12,275
[Meanwhile]

1295
01:13:13,609 --> 01:13:17,814
[Eric starting to feel panicked once realizing
that two of his members have been ousted.]

1296
01:13:19,195 --> 01:13:21,607
[Let me think about this a moment...]

1297
01:13:21,608 --> 01:13:26,830
<i>[Yellow parasol]</i>

1298
01:13:27,698 --> 01:13:33,519
[A yellow parasol?
That would be that rooftop over there...]

1299
01:13:37,001 --> 01:13:40,335
[Get the shoes from the undead,
and head over to that rooftop?]

1300
01:13:41,558 --> 01:13:46,586
[I'm sure that something must be up there!]

1301
01:13:49,696 --> 01:13:51,286
[Gary having distanced himself
away from the pack.]

1302
01:13:54,319 --> 01:13:57,330
[Min Woo and Jun Jin
closing in on their prey.]

1303
01:14:02,284 --> 01:14:03,667
There's one over there.

1304
01:14:03,668 --> 01:14:08,005
[Gary discovers Jun Jin and
turns around to go the other way.]

1305
01:14:09,158 --> 01:14:11,909
[But Min Woo is waiting for him
on the other side!]

1306
01:14:11,910 --> 01:14:13,574
They've got me flanked on both sides.

1307
01:14:15,005 --> 01:14:18,191
[Gary is surrounded
with nowhere to run to!]

1308
01:14:23,473 --> 01:14:25,591
[Deflects the attack and escapes
his imminent danger!]

1309
01:14:26,524 --> 01:14:29,356
[But Min Woo and Jun Jin aren't
letting up on their attack!]

1310
01:14:34,801 --> 01:14:37,414
[Joined effort by the two ace players
from Team Shinhwa!]

1311
01:14:38,729 --> 01:14:41,693
[Min Woo eliminates Gary's name tag!]

1312
01:14:42,300 --> 01:14:43,503
That was so close!

1313
01:14:43,504 --> 01:14:47,979
[Could Gary be the undead?
No, he's not!]

1314
01:14:47,980 --> 01:14:49,031
It's not Gary?

1315
01:14:49,066 --> 01:14:52,911
<i>Gary, out.
Gary, out.</i>

1316
01:14:54,819 --> 01:14:56,027
They're about to make an announcement.

1317
01:14:56,557 --> 01:14:58,304
- What? Gary's been ousted?
- By whom?

1318
01:14:58,305 --> 01:15:00,161
[Shocked at the announcement of
Running Man member's first elimination.]

1319
01:15:00,161 --> 01:15:01,849
I bet it was Jun Jin and someone else.

1320
01:15:01,850 --> 01:15:03,875
Gary's been ousted?

1321
01:15:04,453 --> 01:15:05,616
Darn.

1322
01:15:06,219 --> 01:15:09,113
[Min and Jin working in unison
and back on the prowl.]

1323
01:15:12,143 --> 01:15:15,181
[Discovers Jae Suk and Ha Ha off
in the distance.]

1324
01:15:15,488 --> 01:15:17,912
Jae Suk, I think we can take them on.

1325
01:15:18,269 --> 01:15:22,768
But what if Eric shows up too,
and there are three of them?

1326
01:15:24,059 --> 01:15:26,816
[Full of confidence.]

1327
01:15:27,965 --> 01:15:32,022
[Flustered at the sight of Shinhwa members
approaching them with such confidence.]

1328
01:15:32,023 --> 01:15:34,807
Come back here for now.
They look way too confident right now.

1329
01:15:34,808 --> 01:15:38,792
[To the left- Jun Jin.
To the right- Min Woo.]

1330
01:15:38,793 --> 01:15:40,617
- Watch out for Min Woo.
- What are you doing?

1331
01:15:40,618 --> 01:15:42,300
Hang on a second.
Already?

1332
01:15:42,744 --> 01:15:44,850
[What are you waiting for?
Fight!]

1333
01:15:45,852 --> 01:15:47,784
[A fierce battle breaks out
between Jun Jin and Jae Suk!]

1334
01:15:49,628 --> 01:15:52,511
[And over on this side, it's Min Woo and Ha Ha,
who are of the same age!]

1335
01:15:56,040 --> 01:15:57,993
[What?
Simultaneously?]

1336
01:16:00,312 --> 01:16:03,152
[Min Woo eliminates Ha Ha's name tag first!]

1337
01:16:03,861 --> 01:16:08,246
[Ha Ha... is not the undead!]

1338
01:16:09,520 --> 01:16:10,613
Ha Ha?

1339
01:16:10,877 --> 01:16:13,719
[Two against one!
Min Woo and Jun Jin attacks Jae Suk!]

1340
01:16:13,720 --> 01:16:15,633
[Jae Suk in extreme danger!]

1341
01:16:18,491 --> 01:16:20,977
[Could Jae Suk be the one?]

1342
01:16:20,978 --> 01:16:24,694
<i>[The undead]</i>

1343
01:16:27,210 --> 01:16:31,159
[Jae Suk is Team Running Man's undead!]

1344
01:16:38,931 --> 01:16:41,678
[Team Running Man's undead is,
the invincible Yoo-ruce Willis.]

1345
01:16:44,458 --> 01:16:45,553
I'm the undead?

1346
01:16:48,344 --> 01:16:50,389
[In that case...]

1347
01:16:50,505 --> 01:16:56,060
<i>[Steal the shoes from the undead!]</i>

1348
01:16:56,061 --> 01:16:58,431
- Then we need to take Jae Suk's shoes.
- What?

1349
01:16:58,432 --> 01:16:59,915
[Now they're after Jae Suk's shoes!]

1350
01:16:59,916 --> 01:17:01,021
We need his shoes.

1351
01:17:03,099 --> 01:17:05,731
[Jae Suk is about to lose his shoes
without even knowing the reason for it!]

1352
01:17:09,699 --> 01:17:11,939
[Jae Suk eliminates Min Woo's name tag!]

1353
01:17:12,437 --> 01:17:15,126
[Min Woo isn't the undead of Team Shinhwa!]

1354
01:17:16,298 --> 01:17:19,702
[Jun Jin trying with all his might
to get the shoes off of Jae Suk's feet!]

1355
01:17:22,635 --> 01:17:25,224
I'm the undead!
I'm going to eliminate you too.

1356
01:17:25,678 --> 01:17:27,679
But we already eliminated your name tag.
Are you allowed to be doing this?

1357
01:17:27,680 --> 01:17:29,963
[Jae Suk can't be killed even if his
name tag has been eliminated already.]

1358
01:17:29,963 --> 01:17:31,043
He's the undead.

1359
01:17:31,515 --> 01:17:34,530
[There's nothing for him to fear anymore.]

1360
01:17:34,531 --> 01:17:36,338
- Can I just have one of your shoes?
- Sorry, but you can't.

1361
01:17:37,137 --> 01:17:38,791
So the shoes have something
to do with it?

1362
01:17:38,792 --> 01:17:41,435
- It's the shoes?
- No, mine are just too sweaty.

1363
01:17:43,992 --> 01:17:46,436
[Jun Jin the Bull trying to get Jae Suk's
shoes no matter what he has to do!]

1364
01:17:47,408 --> 01:17:48,704
Come on!

1365
01:17:50,187 --> 01:17:54,003
[Just then, Team Running Man hears
the commotion and rushes in to help!]

1366
01:17:54,750 --> 01:17:56,835
- What took you guys so long?
- Jae Suk.

1367
01:17:58,535 --> 01:18:01,097
Don't walk around by yourself.
Have you been ousted?

1368
01:18:01,737 --> 01:18:05,237
[Members discovers Jae Suk's bare back
without his name tag!]

1369
01:18:05,238 --> 01:18:07,112
- Are you out?
- I was walking with Ha Ha...

1370
01:18:07,257 --> 01:18:09,268
- No, I'm the undead.
- Really?

1371
01:18:09,269 --> 01:18:10,709
It was you?

1372
01:18:11,641 --> 01:18:13,305
- That's not bad.
- I like that.

1373
01:18:13,306 --> 01:18:16,560
- That means that you can't die.
- Only Jin and Eric are still alive.

1374
01:18:16,561 --> 01:18:18,458
I bet it's Eric.
I don't think it's Jin.

1375
01:18:18,459 --> 01:18:20,639
I think we need to eliminate Eric
and verify the hunch that we have.

1376
01:18:20,757 --> 01:18:24,320
But what does it matter even if we do that?
We don't know what the incantation is.

1377
01:18:24,321 --> 01:18:27,450
Eliminating the undead from their team
is going to work to our disadvantage.

1378
01:18:27,537 --> 01:18:30,111
We're just letting them know who
the invincible immortal is on the team.

1379
01:18:30,330 --> 01:18:34,304
[That's correct... because the undead is
just going to attack Team RM ruthlessly.]

1380
01:18:34,305 --> 01:18:35,871
- But we still have to know what's going on.
- We need to capture one of them.

1381
01:18:35,872 --> 01:18:37,335
Do you think they know
what the incantation is?

1382
01:18:37,336 --> 01:18:39,703
- They have more hints than we do.
- They have all the good hints.

1383
01:18:39,961 --> 01:18:42,304
Jong Kook, I think you need to capture
one of them first

1384
01:18:42,305 --> 01:18:44,328
and we have no other choice but to
torture the answer out of them.

1385
01:18:44,583 --> 01:18:47,613
[Is there really a need to do all that?]

1386
01:18:48,100 --> 01:18:51,445
- You know I'm not that kind of a person.
- I know, but victory is on the line.

1387
01:18:51,446 --> 01:18:53,422
[They somehow need to find out what
the incantation is from Team Shinhwa.]

1388
01:18:53,693 --> 01:18:57,486
[The two survivors of Team Shinhwa,
Eric and Jun Jin meet up discreetly.]

1389
01:18:57,486 --> 01:19:01,243
Jin, we're the only two that are left.
We can't be seen together.

1390
01:19:01,244 --> 01:19:03,906
- It's Jae Suk.
- He's the undead?

1391
01:19:03,907 --> 01:19:06,470
[Alerting Eric to the fact that
Jae Suk is the undead of that team.]

1392
01:19:06,471 --> 01:19:13,147
[Now, they have to take Jae Suk's shoe
and take it up to the yellow parasol!]

1393
01:19:16,389 --> 01:19:21,642
[There's only one solution!
A face-off to steal Jae Suk's shoe!]

1394
01:19:22,701 --> 01:19:24,666
Why do they look so confident?

1395
01:19:24,667 --> 01:19:27,308
- They already saw us.
- How can they look so confident?

1396
01:19:28,247 --> 01:19:29,506
There they come.

1397
01:19:29,899 --> 01:19:32,769
Why do you look so confident, Jun Jin?
You're flustering me.

1398
01:19:32,770 --> 01:19:34,091
Do you know what the incantation is?

1399
01:19:34,092 --> 01:19:35,499
- Yes, of course.
- Of course, we know.

1400
01:19:35,500 --> 01:19:37,826
- How do you know?
- Then we're the ones at a disadvantage.

1401
01:19:38,808 --> 01:19:43,455
[A difficult situation to figure out no matter
how many survivors are left on Team RM.]

1402
01:19:43,456 --> 01:19:46,893
- The truth is, we're not afraid of you guys.
- Why not?

1403
01:19:46,893 --> 01:19:50,895
Because we know all the hints,
and one of us two is the undead.

1404
01:19:51,201 --> 01:19:53,003
[The tables have now turned.]

1405
01:19:54,338 --> 01:19:57,541
What is there to be afraid of
when one of us is invincible?

1406
01:19:57,713 --> 01:20:01,920
- Wait, but it could be Jun Jin too.
- We need to know what they want first.

1407
01:20:01,921 --> 01:20:04,326
[Proposing a trade in order for
each team to get what they want.]

1408
01:20:04,327 --> 01:20:07,085
We want to talk to Jae Suk alone
for a moment.

1409
01:20:07,086 --> 01:20:08,965
Why do you want to talk to him alone?

1410
01:20:08,966 --> 01:20:10,216
Just for a moment.
It won't take long.

1411
01:20:12,505 --> 01:20:14,432
Then are you going to let us know
what the hint says?

1412
01:20:15,014 --> 01:20:17,821
- Let us know what the incantation is?
- We'll give you a hint about the incantation.

1413
01:20:17,822 --> 01:20:19,533
We can't let you know what
the incantation is all at once.

1414
01:20:19,534 --> 01:20:21,288
You have to do as we say.

1415
01:20:21,289 --> 01:20:23,464
- Do you know what it is?
- We know everything.

1416
01:20:23,465 --> 01:20:26,798
You want us to tell you why it is
that you have to do as we say?

1417
01:20:27,336 --> 01:20:29,172
Do you want all five of us to
let you know the reason why?

1418
01:20:29,604 --> 01:20:31,732
[Okay then...]

1419
01:20:31,733 --> 01:20:34,453
We'll tell you what the first letter says.

1420
01:20:34,454 --> 01:20:37,304
[Team Running Man only knows what the
first initials of what each letter says.]

1421
01:20:37,305 --> 01:20:40,707
Then just leave us with two people to face,
and we'll let you know what the first word is.

1422
01:20:40,708 --> 01:20:43,039
- You want two people?
- Just two of you.

1423
01:20:44,053 --> 01:20:45,744
Jae Suk and Ji Hyo.

1424
01:20:49,140 --> 01:20:51,969
- You're being too much right now.
- Ji Hyo ousted Hye Sung!

1425
01:20:51,970 --> 01:20:53,513
Don't you even have a conscience?

1426
01:20:54,729 --> 01:20:57,651
Okay, then fine.
Since you're all veterans...

1427
01:20:57,985 --> 01:21:00,233
We want Jae Suk and Kwang Soo.

1428
01:21:00,234 --> 01:21:01,794
- Us two?
- Let's do it, Jae Suk.

1429
01:21:01,795 --> 01:21:04,405
- Okay, fine.
- The rest of you needs to leave.

1430
01:21:04,406 --> 01:21:06,365
- What about the hint?
- You have to let us know what the hint is.

1431
01:21:06,366 --> 01:21:07,873
- You have to tell us the hint.
- The first letter.

1432
01:21:07,874 --> 01:21:09,089
Gol.

1433
01:21:09,090 --> 01:21:10,422
- Gol.
- Gol?

1434
01:21:12,831 --> 01:21:16,260
- If you guys are lying about this...
- I promise you, we're not.

1435
01:21:16,261 --> 01:21:19,090
[Will Team Running Man be able to guess
that the incantation is, 'Gold power'?]

1436
01:21:19,091 --> 01:21:21,205
- The rest of you needs to leave.
- good luck, you guys.

1437
01:21:21,639 --> 01:21:23,185
- Fighting.
- This is seriously...

1438
01:21:23,186 --> 01:21:25,308
- We'll tell you one more letter.
- Okay.

1439
01:21:25,619 --> 01:21:26,914
Gol...

1440
01:21:28,366 --> 01:21:29,522
Gold.

1441
01:21:29,523 --> 01:21:31,492
- What?
- Gold.

1442
01:21:31,527 --> 01:21:33,551
[Gold?]

1443
01:21:33,552 --> 01:21:35,871
- Stop kidding us around.
- No, it's true.

1444
01:21:35,872 --> 01:21:37,583
- Gold?
- Gold?

1445
01:21:37,584 --> 01:21:39,410
- Really?
- Gold makes sense.

1446
01:21:39,411 --> 01:21:45,154
[Correct answer- Gold Power.
Will Running Man figure out the rest?]

1447
01:21:45,527 --> 01:21:46,943
We're not the ones at a
disadvantage here.

1448
01:21:46,944 --> 01:21:49,217
Gold pie?
Gold coin?

1449
01:21:50,947 --> 01:21:53,770
[Clueless]

1450
01:21:56,011 --> 01:21:57,446
I'm the undead.

1451
01:21:58,613 --> 01:22:01,574
[Team Running Man's Jae Suk and Kwang Soo
vs. Team Shinhwa's Jun Jin and Eric.]

1452
01:22:05,828 --> 01:22:07,540
[Kwang Soo eliminates Eric's name tag!]

1453
01:22:07,541 --> 01:22:11,258
[What will be found underneath
Eric's name tag?]

1454
01:22:11,259 --> 01:22:13,411
<i>[The undead]</i>

1455
01:22:14,031 --> 01:22:17,662
[Eric is the undead from Team Shinhwa!]

1456
01:22:17,663 --> 01:22:20,176
[Eric is invincible!]

1457
01:22:23,545 --> 01:22:25,713
[During the melee,
Jae Suk eliminates Jun Jin's name tag!]

1458
01:22:26,981 --> 01:22:31,404
[Eric takes advantage of this moment
to steal Jae Suk's shoe away from him!]

1459
01:22:35,023 --> 01:22:38,324
[The undead, Eric running away
with Jae Suk's shoe in hand!]

1460
01:22:42,452 --> 01:22:43,865
Hey!
My shoe!

1461
01:22:44,608 --> 01:22:45,914
It's the shoe!

1462
01:22:46,972 --> 01:22:48,880
Eric can't be caught.

1463
01:22:48,881 --> 01:22:51,695
We have to get him no matter what.
Kwang Soo!

1464
01:22:51,967 --> 01:22:53,349
Eric's shoe!

1465
01:22:56,445 --> 01:23:03,304
[In the meantime, Eric is racing towards the
yellow parasol with Jae Suk's shoe in hand!]

1466
01:23:04,743 --> 01:23:07,087
[Difficult to chase after Eric
with one shoe missing.]

1467
01:23:07,555 --> 01:23:09,788
- Just rest here for a moment.
- Can you give me a piggyback ride?

1468
01:23:10,772 --> 01:23:12,702
We have to get to our teammates.
Hurry up and give me a ride.

1469
01:23:18,257 --> 01:23:19,552
Hurry, Kwang Soo.

1470
01:23:22,235 --> 01:23:23,284
It's Eric.

1471
01:23:23,701 --> 01:23:26,661
[Emergency situation!
Team Running Man gathering for a meeting.]

1472
01:23:26,662 --> 01:23:29,096
- We had to eliminate their name tag.
- But now that we have...

1473
01:23:29,445 --> 01:23:32,845
[They need to figure out
what the incantation is...]

1474
01:23:35,652 --> 01:23:39,795
Hey, we can just follow Eric and
hear what the incantation is.

1475
01:23:40,162 --> 01:23:42,068
- Yeah! Hurry up and go.
- You're right.

1476
01:23:42,464 --> 01:23:45,354
[Follow Eric and listen in on
what the incantation is!]

1477
01:23:46,324 --> 01:23:47,764
Run faster!

1478
01:23:51,991 --> 01:23:55,333
[Eric arrives on the rooftop
with the yellow parasol.]

1479
01:23:58,996 --> 01:24:01,972
<i>[Put the item of the undead in here,
and recite the incantation.]</i>

1480
01:24:07,367 --> 01:24:10,266
[It's now time to recite the incantation.]

1481
01:24:10,267 --> 01:24:13,555
Gold power.
Go away, invincible immortal.

1482
01:24:16,039 --> 01:24:19,294
Gold power.
Go away, invincible immortal.

1483
01:24:19,971 --> 01:24:22,766
[Gold power is activated!]

1484
01:24:27,252 --> 01:24:31,415
[The shoe disappears and
in its place is a golden glove!]

1485
01:24:34,425 --> 01:24:38,993
[An old parchment inside the glove.]

1486
01:24:39,251 --> 01:24:44,419
<i>[The only way to eliminate the undead is to
eliminate his name tag with this glove on.]</i>

1487
01:24:44,454 --> 01:24:45,717
So that's the way to kill him?

1488
01:24:45,718 --> 01:24:50,689
<i>[Gather the name tags from both undead and
place them on top of the treasure chest</i>

1489
01:24:50,690 --> 01:24:54,308
<i>to lift the curse off the gold,
and take the treasure.]</i>

1490
01:24:54,627 --> 01:25:00,878
[All his needs to do now is eliminate
Jae Suk's name tag with the gloved hand!]

1491
01:25:02,562 --> 01:25:05,688
[Keeping the gold glove hidden
and out of sight for now.]

1492
01:25:05,689 --> 01:25:06,811
Let's make a deal, Jae Suk.

1493
01:25:06,812 --> 01:25:08,514
You have to take his shoe off.

1494
01:25:10,838 --> 01:25:11,889
What is that?

1495
01:25:13,057 --> 01:25:15,464
[Team Running Man discovers
Eric's golden glove!]

1496
01:25:15,465 --> 01:25:17,849
- We have to get that glove!
- Where's Jae Suk's shoe?

1497
01:25:17,850 --> 01:25:19,753
- What is that?
- Don't touch me!

1498
01:25:19,754 --> 01:25:21,761
Don't you dare try to touch me!
You'll all be dead if you do!

1499
01:25:21,762 --> 01:25:22,874
I'll eliminate all of you!

1500
01:25:22,909 --> 01:25:25,700
[Eric blatantly lies as he
senses that he's in danger.]

1501
01:25:29,419 --> 01:25:30,762
Don't do it!

1502
01:25:30,763 --> 01:25:32,542
- What?
- You have to take his shoe off!

1503
01:25:32,543 --> 01:25:35,364
- Go ahead and try it!
- What is that?

1504
01:25:35,365 --> 01:25:37,479
- Try it and take it!
- What is that!

1505
01:25:37,480 --> 01:25:39,126
- Hey!
- What is it?

1506
01:25:39,127 --> 01:25:42,003
[May not know what it is, but
Eric is doing a fine job of scaring them.]

1507
01:25:42,004 --> 01:25:44,121
You have to get his shoe off.
Get his shoe off his foot.

1508
01:25:45,431 --> 01:25:48,016
What are you doing?
Just get his shoe off of him!

1509
01:25:49,927 --> 01:25:51,374
[Team Running man attempting to get
Eric's shoe off of his foot.]

1510
01:25:51,375 --> 01:25:53,688
[vs. Eric trying to eliminate
Jae Suk's name tag.]

1511
01:25:53,689 --> 01:25:56,072
[The final battle!]

1512
01:25:56,073 --> 01:25:58,254
- Get his shoe off.
- We have to get his shoe.

1513
01:25:58,255 --> 01:25:59,745
[They did manage to get Eric's
shoe off for now...]

1514
01:25:59,746 --> 01:26:01,402
Where am I supposed to take the shoe?

1515
01:26:01,403 --> 01:26:02,979
- Go!
- Go where?

1516
01:26:02,980 --> 01:26:04,281
[Not sure where to go since she
doesn't know about the yellow parasol.]

1517
01:26:05,875 --> 01:26:07,177
[Just then]

1518
01:26:07,178 --> 01:26:11,135
[Eric attacks Jae Suk's name tag!]

1519
01:26:15,564 --> 01:26:19,609
[Eric eliminates Jae Suk's name tag!]

1520
01:26:20,858 --> 01:26:22,918
If the name tag of the undead is eliminated
with the golden gloved hand

1521
01:26:22,919 --> 01:26:24,076
then the undead can be eliminated.

1522
01:26:24,077 --> 01:26:26,503
[Eric gathers the two 'undead' name tags
with his gloved hand.]

1523
01:26:26,504 --> 01:26:28,112
Do I have to say, 'Gold Power' again?

1524
01:26:29,632 --> 01:26:31,012
Gold power!

1525
01:26:31,013 --> 01:26:33,934
Go away, undead... no, that's not it.

1526
01:26:34,405 --> 01:26:35,960
Undead... no, that's not it.

1527
01:26:36,331 --> 01:26:38,079
What was it?
What was it, Kwang Soo?

1528
01:26:38,080 --> 01:26:41,551
Gold power.
Go away, invincible immortal.

1529
01:26:41,552 --> 01:26:43,401
What are you doing?

1530
01:26:45,157 --> 01:26:46,977
Success!

1531
01:26:46,978 --> 01:26:49,595
Guys!

1532
01:26:51,589 --> 01:26:55,506
[Back to the ship where the
treasure chest with the gold awaits them!]

1533
01:26:55,767 --> 01:26:58,403
No matter the fact that
we outnumbered them...

1534
01:26:58,404 --> 01:26:59,977
there was just no way for us
to beat them.

1535
01:26:59,978 --> 01:27:02,445
[The two name tags of the 'undead'
in Eric's hand.]

1536

world of variety by claiming victory!]

1537

of the treasure chest filled with gold.]

1538
01:27:17,383 --> 01:27:20,191
[The curse of the gold...]

1539
01:27:20,192 --> 01:27:23,022
[will now be lifted.]

1540
01:27:25,252 --> 01:27:29,013
[A new treasure chest appears
in front of their very own eyes?]

1541
01:27:33,499 --> 01:27:36,523
[All the gold that had turned into
scrap metal by the curse...]

1542
01:27:36,524 --> 01:27:41,287
[transformed back into priceless treasure
with the curse having been lifted!]

1543
01:27:43,733 --> 01:27:45,493
- Look at all that gold!
- Is it real gold?

1544
01:27:46,074 --> 01:27:48,193
Are you giving this to us?
Seriously?

1545
01:27:51,907 --> 01:27:53,899
You guys have to come back
on the show.

1546
01:27:53,900 --> 01:27:56,501
We've been losing to them all day.

1547
01:27:56,502 --> 01:27:58,179
[For the first time in history,
Running Man loses every single round.]

1548
01:27:59,830 --> 01:28:01,911
Today's victors... Shinhwa!

1549
01:28:01,912 --> 01:28:04,854
[Pirates of the Western Sea-
Shinhwa takes possession of the gold!]

1550
01:28:04,855 --> 01:28:06,168
Please invite us on more often.

1551
01:28:07,364 --> 01:28:09,552
It's been so fun having these guys on
who are more like my old friends.

1552
01:28:09,553 --> 01:28:11,251
[An enjoyable day for all!]

1553
01:28:12,017 --> 01:28:13,780
How are we as the boys from
back in the day?

1554
01:28:13,781 --> 01:28:15,388
There's a difference.
