instead of dancing on stage?]

00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:00,857
The stage was too far away.

108

Can you do that last move again?
This one.

128
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,446
This one.
I want to see his arm muscles.

168
00:13:01,592 --> 00:13:03,600
Then wouldn't it give the all-male teams
an advantage from the rest of us?

00:13:22,591 --> 00:13:24,699
[First through third place winners can choose
the team that they want to travel with.]

175
00:13:25,329 --> 00:13:29,790
Yeah, they should have other things that they
can play for now that they're on the show.

176
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,151
There has to be other advantages to
being on Running Man.

177
00:13:32,152 --> 00:13:35,223
They should get a chance to go home
with a few new phone numbers.

178
00:13:35,224 --> 00:13:37,886
- Get a few new phone numbers, right?
- You can be text buddies.

179
00:13:37,887 --> 00:13:38,999
That's right.

180
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,634
- You're staying out of it, right?
- Why do I have to stay out of it?

181
00:13:41,635 --> 00:13:43,338
Why are you telling me to stay out of it?

182
00:13:43,339 --> 00:13:46,347
- There's no need for you to partake.
- I'm the best looking of this bunch.

183
00:13:47,139 --> 00:13:50,214
- Then should we play Rock-Paper-Scissors?
- How about Na Eun does the first round?

184
00:13:50,249 --> 00:13:52,925
[Time to choose the other team that they
want to travel with to the first location.]

185
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:55,580
We won!

186
00:13:55,581 --> 00:13:56,710
[Jong Kook and Sistar wins.]

187
00:13:56,711 --> 00:13:58,562
Then we can make the first selection, right?

188
00:13:58,563 --> 00:14:00,989
- We'd like to travel with MBLAQ.
- MBLAQ!

189
00:14:01,453 --> 00:14:03,683
[Jong Kook and Sistar's choice?
Kwang Soo and MBLAQ.]

190
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,526
Kwang Soo.

191
00:14:07,625 --> 00:14:09,952
[Is Kwang Soo really the best looking
of the bunch?]

192
00:14:09,953 --> 00:14:13,248
- We picked them because we like Kwang Soo.
- Really?

193
00:14:13,249 --> 00:14:16,607
They said that Kwang Soo reminds them
of a water skater.

194
00:14:17,383 --> 00:14:20,856
- That's what they told me in the car.
- I guarantee that they don't like Kwang Soo.

195
00:14:21,368 --> 00:14:24,469
I'm serious. I guarantee
that they don't like Kwang Soo.

196
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:27,552
Remember when we were younger how we
always used to like the weird people?

197
00:14:27,553 --> 00:14:29,946
- That's pretty similar to that.
- That's true.

198
00:14:29,947 --> 00:14:32,301
How can you say that?

199
00:14:32,302 --> 00:14:34,512
- Like Lee Young Jung.
- Next is A-Pink.

200
00:14:34,513 --> 00:14:36,191
[Who will Gary and A-Pink choose?]

201
00:14:36,192 --> 00:14:38,333
Ha Ha and Infinite.

202
00:14:38,334 --> 00:14:40,479
[Gary and A-Pink chooses
Ha Ha and Infinite.]

203
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,055
This is the final selection.

204
00:14:42,582 --> 00:14:44,972
If I can be honest about this
right now...

205
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:50,539
- Please help us.
- Did he just ask for help?

206
00:14:51,373 --> 00:14:53,655
- This team isn't bad...
- We really have a chance to win.

207
00:14:53,656 --> 00:14:57,807
[Who will Jae Suk and Girl's Day choose?
Suk Jin and 2PM or Ji Hyo and Beast?]

208
00:14:58,471 --> 00:15:00,274
There's even a good chance of marriage
between my team and your teammates.

209
00:15:00,275 --> 00:15:02,514
I bet the 2PM guys have a lot of
money saved up too.

210
00:15:02,515 --> 00:15:04,158
[Older guys with money?]

211
00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:08,504
- No, these guys from Beast are good too.
- Yes, Beast is a good choice too.

212
00:15:09,691 --> 00:15:12,209
- Okay.
- I heard her say, 'B'.

213
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:13,411
[He heard her say, 'B'?]

214
00:15:16,268 --> 00:15:18,863
They're feeling anxious now that
it's time to make our selection.

215
00:15:18,864 --> 00:15:20,476
Beast!

216
00:15:21,347 --> 00:15:26,032
They were pretty relaxed about it earlier,
but now it's decision time, it's 'Beast!'.

217
00:15:27,687 --> 00:15:30,061
[Jae Suk and Girl's Day selection-
Ji Hyo and Beast.]

218
00:15:30,062 --> 00:15:32,424
This is just the beginning though.

219
00:15:32,425 --> 00:15:34,274
We're going to go with Beast.

220
00:15:35,668 --> 00:15:37,183
It's okay.
We're fine by ourselves.

221
00:15:37,184 --> 00:15:38,513
Thank you.

222
00:15:39,758 --> 00:15:42,907
Why are you blushing?
It's no big deal.

223
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,621
[You just wait and see...]

224
00:15:46,987 --> 00:15:50,430
2PM is really strong,
but Suk Jin is ruining them right now.

225
00:15:51,447 --> 00:15:53,570
I want to pick Woo Young and Chansung.

226
00:15:53,571 --> 00:15:55,231
- It's because of Suk Jin, right?
- It's because of Suk Jin.

227
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:16,757
But, seriously though...
Minah chose Ki Kwang and Doo Joon.

228
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:21,838
- But we know the truth.
- We know we weren't first choice.

229
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:24,314
[Could it be that they just made
a desperate and hasty decision?]

230
00:16:25,575 --> 00:16:28,564
[Is Beast their second choice
after Kwang Soo and MBLAQ?]

231
00:16:29,196 --> 00:16:31,222
No, it's not!

232
00:16:33,884 --> 00:16:35,392
Where is this place?

233
00:16:35,393 --> 00:16:36,901
We're in Chungjoo right now.

234
00:16:37,624 --> 00:16:43,303
You don't even know where you go because you
get shuttled from one performance to another.

235
00:16:43,304 --> 00:16:45,591
You just assume you're where you're supposed
to be when your manager drives you there.

236
00:16:45,592 --> 00:16:47,689
You just think to yourself,
'So this is where I'm working.'

237
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:49,466
[So busy they don't even notice
where they are.]

238
00:16:49,467 --> 00:16:51,663
[Just get out of the car,
and shout out, 'Hello!']

239
00:16:52,986 --> 00:16:55,728
And once the show's over, shout out,
'Thank you!' and pass out in the car.

240
00:16:55,729 --> 00:16:58,204
[And pass out once in the car...]

241
00:16:58,205 --> 00:16:59,456
- I'm right, aren't I?
- Yes, you are.

242
00:17:00,942 --> 00:17:03,114
I'm so happy today.

243
00:17:03,115 --> 00:17:06,129
[Everyone in high spirits from
working alongside the fresh faced idols.]

244
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:08,014
What's your ideal type, Eun Ji?

245
00:17:08,015 --> 00:17:09,961
Pick one of the two guys from Infinite.

246
00:17:09,962 --> 00:17:12,305
Um... Sung Gyu?

247
00:17:12,306 --> 00:17:15,650
Yes, Sung Gyu.
I think he has a great personality.

248
00:17:17,385 --> 00:17:18,765
What about you, Na Eun?

249
00:17:18,766 --> 00:17:21,348
Me?
First...

250
00:17:21,349 --> 00:17:24,153
I find both of them to be very attractive.

251
00:17:24,154 --> 00:17:25,451
That's a very good answer.

252
00:17:25,452 --> 00:17:27,075
If you answer it like that,
then what does that make me?

253
00:17:27,076 --> 00:17:28,946
That means you like Sung Gyu, doesn't it?

254
00:17:28,947 --> 00:17:31,636
[Eun Ji's choice is Sung Gyu.]

255
00:17:31,637 --> 00:17:35,222
[Eun Ji likes Sung Gyu!]

256
00:17:35,974 --> 00:17:39,218
Sung Gyu's sitting very still back here.
He's not even budging right now.

257
00:17:39,882 --> 00:17:43,329
- He's trying to be very cool right now.
- He's trying to play it cool right now.

258
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:44,977
I'll consider your love confession.

259
00:17:46,117 --> 00:17:48,060
He says he'll consider her love confession!

260
00:17:52,203 --> 00:17:55,691
- I want to get closer to Kwang Soo.
- I want you to do that as well.

261
00:17:55,769 --> 00:18:01,580
Kwang Soo was the second celebrity
that I ever met.

262
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:04,292
And when I saw him in person,
I noticed how tall he really was.

263
00:18:04,293 --> 00:18:05,811
- I thought to myself, 'He's so cool'.
- Really?

264
00:18:05,812 --> 00:18:07,835
I think Dasom really likes you.

265
00:18:07,995 --> 00:18:09,952
I'm just a real fan of his.

266
00:18:12,237 --> 00:18:15,363
[That's... pretty sweet.]

267
00:18:17,729 --> 00:18:22,186
[These joint car rides are full of
good cheer and laughter...]

268
00:18:29,689 --> 00:18:31,483
Should we come up with a battle cry
for our team?

269
00:18:31,996 --> 00:18:34,404
- There's something that we normally do.
- What is it?

270
00:18:34,405 --> 00:18:36,192
It's a battle cry that our group always
uses before each performance.

271
00:18:36,193 --> 00:18:39,450
- Okay, what is it?
- Chansung or you can say the first part.

272
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:42,135
When Chansung would shout out,
'Who Am I?'...

273
00:18:42,136 --> 00:18:44,891
- Then the rest would say, ' I Am Champion!'
- Oh, I like that.

274
00:18:44,892 --> 00:18:47,068
Let's give it a try right now.
Set, go.

275
00:18:47,103 --> 00:18:50,472
- Who am I!
- I am champion!

276
00:18:56,124 --> 00:18:58,147
Wow, sports center!

277
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:02,185
[First mission location-
Chungjoo's 'P' swimming pool.]

278
00:19:03,547 --> 00:19:04,778
What is this?

279
00:19:05,889 --> 00:19:08,413
[Flag stands in the swimming pool?]

280
00:19:09,032 --> 00:19:10,439
Where are you going to stick it?

281
00:19:12,076 --> 00:19:15,234
[Stick their team's flag wherever
they would like to.]

282
00:19:15,235 --> 00:19:16,606
I don't know where the best spot
would be to stick this flag.

283
00:19:17,541 --> 00:19:21,057
[All the other teams are also rushing in!]

284
00:19:29,587 --> 00:19:34,695
[Although they don't know what the mission is,
they're aligning themselves in order.]

285
00:19:40,473 --> 00:19:42,078
- Do you think this would be a good spot?
- Let's just pick that one.

286
00:19:42,636 --> 00:19:44,132
<i>Your first mission...</i>

287
00:19:44,405 --> 00:19:46,966
<i>is 'The Swimming Pool Island.'</i>

288
00:19:46,967 --> 00:19:48,375
[First mission- Swimming Pool Island.]

289
00:19:48,376 --> 00:19:52,285
<i>All 21 of you will start off
at the same time...</i>

290
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:56,803
<i>and you have to pull yourselves up
on this float that you see in the middle.</i>

291
00:19:57,234 --> 00:19:58,627
Every single one of us?

292
00:19:58,628 --> 00:20:03,900
<i>But... this is on a first come,
first served basis.</i>

293
00:20:04,752 --> 00:20:07,747
<i>At the end of each round, the
people whose names I mention will pass.</i>

294
00:20:08,093 --> 00:20:12,480
<i>And the first team that has all three members
of their team to pass is the winner, okay?</i>

295
00:20:12,481 --> 00:20:15,159
[All three members of the team must pass
in order to succeed the mission.]

296
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,458
What did he say?

297
00:20:17,184 --> 00:20:18,866
Basically, we have to get up there quickly
in order for us to win.

298
00:20:18,867 --> 00:20:20,832
- And once we get up there?
- You have to stay up there.

299
00:20:21,506 --> 00:20:23,506
It's not always best to be
the first ones up there, right?

300
00:20:23,825 --> 00:20:27,165
So being first ones up there
isn't what's most important.

301
00:20:27,166 --> 00:20:30,095
- It's important, but...
- But we have to make sure to stay up there.

302
00:20:30,096 --> 00:20:32,136
It's also important that we have to stop
the other team members from getting up there.

303
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:35,303
Ugh... this isn't looking good.

304
00:20:37,006 --> 00:20:38,653
No, we can do this!

305
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:39,936
Jong Kook.

306
00:20:40,493 --> 00:20:44,251
[Traitor Kwang Soo already trying
to forge an alliance?]

307
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:47,740
- We'll help you.
- But I'm afraid to fall in deep water.

308
00:20:47,741 --> 00:20:48,871
We'll all help you.

309
00:20:50,617 --> 00:20:55,180
[Just which one of the teams
will be the first to succeed the mission?]

310
00:20:55,181 --> 00:20:59,458
[Round one- First come, first served...
First five people.]

311
00:20:59,459 --> 00:21:03,773
[The five people found standing on top of the
float at the end of the time limit passes!]

312
00:21:06,016 --> 00:21:08,727
[First Round-
First come, first served mission- Start!]

313
00:21:10,317 --> 00:21:15,155
[As soon as the bell sounds...
Everyone jumps in with gusto!]

314
00:21:19,434 --> 00:21:21,554
[Giraffe on the other hand tries to pull
a stunt right from the start.]

315
00:21:21,555 --> 00:21:24,470
[Lets you and I die together!]

316
00:21:26,631 --> 00:21:29,068
[Everyone heading towards the
island in the middle!]

317
00:21:29,069 --> 00:21:30,488
You have to get him!

318
00:21:31,426 --> 00:21:33,612
[Chansung of 2PM is the first
to pull himself up onto the float!]

319
00:21:34,186 --> 00:21:36,993
[MBLAQ's Joon, and
Beast's Ki Kwang as well!]

320
00:21:40,323 --> 00:21:42,876
[It's goodbye for Joon as soon as
he pulls himself up onto the float!]

321
00:21:52,347 --> 00:21:53,505
Suk Jin!

322
00:21:54,653 --> 00:21:56,905
[If Suk Jin can pull himself onto the float,
Sun Jin and 2PM will be the first to pass!]

323
00:21:58,632 --> 00:22:01,663
[Chansung and Woo Young of 2PM are
fighting a lone battle on the float!]

324
00:22:02,396 --> 00:22:04,668
[Gary is doing whatever he can to stop
Suk Jin from getting on the float.]

325
00:22:04,826 --> 00:22:08,124
[The island still only belongs to
Chansung and Woo Young of 2PM!]

326
00:22:09,847 --> 00:22:12,097
[Wow! Even Mr. Capable gets eliminated!]

327
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,256
[2PM's monstrous power!]

328
00:22:18,451 --> 00:22:20,882
[Oh! Is Suk Jin finally getting up there?]

329
00:22:20,883 --> 00:22:23,672
[If Suk Jin can only pull himself up there,
Suk Jin and 2PM will be the first to pass!]

330
00:22:29,258 --> 00:22:30,669
[No!]

331
00:22:33,289 --> 00:22:34,710
Hurry up and get up here!

332
00:22:36,303 --> 00:22:39,028
[End of the first round!]

333
00:22:39,346 --> 00:22:42,052
[The time's up!
Woo Young and Chansung passes!]

334
00:22:42,053 --> 00:22:45,888
- Who am I!
- I am champion!

335
00:22:47,042 --> 00:22:48,905
Hey, you gym brats!

336
00:22:49,907 --> 00:22:53,536
[With their monstrous strength, two
members of Suk Jin's team already passes!]

337
00:22:56,719 --> 00:22:59,682
- Suk Jin! Fighting.
- Fighting!

338
00:23:00,236 --> 00:23:03,924
- Who am I!
- I am champion!

339
00:23:04,526 --> 00:23:10,671
<i>At this point, 2PM will win this mission
as soon as Ji Suk Jin boards the float.</i>

340
00:23:10,672 --> 00:23:13,122
<i>It's an advantage and disadvantage
right at the same time.</i>

341
00:23:13,596 --> 00:23:15,597
It doesn't matter how good
Woo Young and Chansung are.

342
00:23:15,598 --> 00:23:17,255
They'll never win because of Suk Jin.

343
00:23:17,653 --> 00:23:19,629
You have to get in your heads that
you're going to come in at last place.

344
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:22,146
[Suk Jin will never get up on the float,
so be prepared to come in at last place?]

345
00:23:24,654 --> 00:23:27,492
We're jumping in as soon as
the whistle sounds, okay?

346
00:23:27,493 --> 00:23:30,310
Hey! Don't even
think about grabbing me again.

347
00:23:31,335 --> 00:23:34,443
You really are a dirty player.

348
00:23:35,955 --> 00:23:40,414
[Round Two- First come, first served race.
Three people.]

349
00:23:41,462 --> 00:23:43,719
[Start]

350
00:23:45,565 --> 00:23:48,439
[Giraffe as we know it!
Interfering with Jae Suk once again.]

351
00:23:52,504 --> 00:23:56,185
[The rest of the members make their way
towards the island without any hesitation!]

352
00:23:58,371 --> 00:24:02,131
[First to climb up is...
Team Ji Hyo and Beast's Doo Joon!]

353
00:24:04,893 --> 00:24:06,637
Suk Jin!

354
00:24:07,170 --> 00:24:09,374
[Suk Jin is actually doing a good job
of climbing aboard the float!]

355
00:24:10,810 --> 00:24:12,661
[Utter chaos.]

356
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:18,307
[Common enemy?
Must stop Suk Jin!]

357
00:24:19,567 --> 00:24:23,008
[Suk Jin succeeds in pulling himself
aboard for now.]

358
00:24:24,227 --> 00:24:26,270
[Please stay up there!]

359
00:24:27,089 --> 00:24:29,761
[This isn't looking good...]

360
00:24:29,762 --> 00:24:31,673
We have to pull Suk Jin down!

361
00:24:33,929 --> 00:24:37,699
[If he can stand to stay up there,
then Team Suk Jin and 2PM wins!]

362
00:24:37,956 --> 00:24:42,452
[Will Suk Jin be able to stay up there?]

363
00:24:42,453 --> 00:24:44,303
[No!]

364
00:24:49,131 --> 00:24:50,935
[Ah... ultimately...]

365
00:24:50,936 --> 00:24:53,594
[Guys, I'm sorry...]

366
00:24:55,134 --> 00:24:57,512
[Utter disappointment.]

367
00:25:01,073 --> 00:25:03,933
[Ah... if I had stuck it out
just a little bit longer...]

368
00:25:04,644 --> 00:25:07,386
[On the other hand,
it's utter chaos on top of the island.]

369
00:25:07,387 --> 00:25:09,543
[Doo Joon of Team Ji Hyo falls into the water
after having been the first one to climb up.]

370
00:25:12,605 --> 00:25:14,828
[Jong Kook eliminates Seung Ho of
Team Kwang Soo and MBLAQ.]

371
00:25:16,033 --> 00:25:18,394
[It is absolute chaos on the island!]

372
00:25:21,412 --> 00:25:23,591
[Dasom pushes Ji Hyo off the island!]

373
00:25:24,415 --> 00:25:26,149
[More and more people falling
in the water!]

374
00:25:28,674 --> 00:25:30,941
[MBLAQ's Joon ultimately loses to
the crowd and falls in the water!]

375
00:25:32,677 --> 00:25:35,355
[All the members of Team Kwang Soo
and MBLAQ are now in the water.]

376
00:25:38,515 --> 00:25:41,104
[The first three people on the float-
There are currently five people on board!]

377
00:25:43,663 --> 00:25:45,494
[Gary is eliminated!]

378
00:25:45,495 --> 00:25:48,045
[And...]

379
00:25:48,524 --> 00:25:51,570
[L challenges Mr. Capable head on!]

380
00:25:53,144 --> 00:25:56,359
[Just who will manage to stay up there?]

381
00:26:02,135 --> 00:26:04,548
[L and Jong Kook fall into the water
simultaneously!]

382
00:26:09,399 --> 00:26:12,073
<i>Yura and Dasom pass.</i>

383
00:26:12,349 --> 00:26:15,925
[The ultimate survivors are,
Girl's Day- Yura, and Sistar- Dasom!]

384
00:26:15,926 --> 00:26:18,399
<i>Lee Kwang Soo, and Yoo Jae Suk...
take your hands off and get down from there.</i>

385
00:26:19,334 --> 00:26:22,159
[Slyly sneaking up there and pretending
that they were on top of the float?]

386
00:26:23,369 --> 00:26:25,618
- He told you guys to come down.
- Why do you keep doing this to me!

387
00:26:26,606 --> 00:26:29,241
Okay, this is the third round.

388
00:26:30,993 --> 00:26:35,260
[Round three- First come, first served mission.
Five people.]

389
00:26:38,635 --> 00:26:40,423
[Take this and see how you like it!]

390
00:26:44,221 --> 00:26:46,655
[Doo Joon is first to climb aboard again!]

391
00:26:49,335 --> 00:26:52,709
[Joon pulls himself up as well...
and lays himself flat on the surface.]

392
00:26:56,548 --> 00:26:58,069
Suk Jin!

393
00:27:01,739 --> 00:27:03,623
[They are about to lose their minds!]

394
00:27:05,887 --> 00:27:08,172
[But he doesn't give up and
just pulls himself back up again!]

395
00:27:09,393 --> 00:27:10,773
Okay!

396
00:27:11,818 --> 00:27:13,047
Nice!

397
00:27:14,661 --> 00:27:16,143
- Sung Gyu!
- No!

398
00:27:23,222 --> 00:27:25,579
[But someone else is doing a good job
of sticking it out...]

399
00:27:28,679 --> 00:27:30,447
Hang on... that's my appendix!

400
00:27:33,346 --> 00:27:35,654
[Sung Gyu is in danger!]

401
00:27:37,419 --> 00:27:40,231
[At a closer look, it seems
Eun Ji is quite the power house!]

402
00:27:40,232 --> 00:27:42,256
She's stronger than me!

403
00:27:42,883 --> 00:27:44,244
No!

404
00:27:45,055 --> 00:27:47,694
- Don't push our Joon off!
- Why is she so strong?

405
00:27:49,467 --> 00:27:51,743
[Eun Ji is keeping her grip tight
on both Seung Ho and Joon!]

406
00:27:57,383 --> 00:27:59,862
[Falling victim to Eun Ji's strength?]

407
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:08,791
[It ultimately requires the strength of
two men to pull her off!]

408
00:28:11,376 --> 00:28:14,930
[Two men barely manage to pull
Eun Ji off the platform!]

409
00:28:20,213 --> 00:28:22,760
- They are ruthless!
- You were good, Eun Ji.

410
00:28:22,761 --> 00:28:26,514
[Eun Ji is discovered as the new
powerhouse of the idol world.]

411
00:28:27,536 --> 00:28:31,666
[And... just then!]

412
00:28:34,885 --> 00:28:37,013
[Joon is dumped in the water
as he briefly lets down his guard!]

413
00:28:39,059 --> 00:28:41,687
[Round Three- These five people
barely manage to pass the round!]

414
00:28:41,688 --> 00:28:43,584
Do you know what I had to
do to get here?

415
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:47,417
- You're the one with all the dirty tricks!
- What were you doing?

416
00:28:51,466 --> 00:28:55,104
[And in round four-
Ha Ha, Eun Ji and Gary passes.]

417
00:28:55,105 --> 00:28:57,347
[In Round Five-
only two people manages to pass.]

418
00:29:00,214 --> 00:29:03,439
[Minah and Sung Gyu passes.]

419
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:07,737
[Team Ha Ha and Infinite win first place
for being the first team to pass all three!]

420
00:29:08,697 --> 00:29:11,424
[By Round Six, a total of four teams
have managed to pass the mission.]

421
00:29:11,425 --> 00:29:12,460
Let's do this!

422
00:29:12,461 --> 00:29:14,635
This is the battle between real men!

423
00:29:14,636 --> 00:29:17,863
- Only the real aces are left!
- The real ace of all the teams!

424
00:29:19,397 --> 00:29:21,109
This finally feels like a real battle!

425
00:29:21,785 --> 00:29:24,726
[The three usual suspects are all in
one place for the first time in a while.]

426
00:29:24,727 --> 00:29:27,051
I can understand the three of us here,
but what is he still doing here?

427
00:29:27,415 --> 00:29:30,797
[Please add Joon of Team Kwang Soo and
MBLAQ to that list of usual suspects.]

428
00:29:32,108 --> 00:29:35,259
You know how Chansung and Woo Young
were the very first two to pass?

429
00:29:35,469 --> 00:29:37,597
We'll show you how they're going to
come in at last place.

430
00:29:37,598 --> 00:29:40,129
[Will Team Suk Jin and 2PM really come in at
last place after being the first two to pass?]

431
00:29:42,505 --> 00:29:45,856
For Round Seven...
the first two will pass the mission.

432
00:29:45,857 --> 00:29:48,646
[Round Seven- First two people to pass.]

433
00:30:01,123 --> 00:30:05,230
[Jae Suk, in fierce battle mode.]

434
00:30:06,685 --> 00:30:09,328
[Why are you getting in the middle of this?]

435
00:30:12,501 --> 00:30:14,965
[Let's get rid of the big brother first.]

436
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:20,525
- No!
- Please!

437
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:26,020
[And thus, Suk Jin is once again...]

438
00:30:27,009 --> 00:30:29,389
[Jae Suk seizes his chance
and eliminates Kwang Soo too!]

439
00:30:32,948 --> 00:30:34,958
Don't give up!
Don't give up!

440
00:30:37,011 --> 00:30:39,906
[Joon and Kwang Soo doing whatever
they can to make it up on to the float!]

441
00:30:51,412 --> 00:30:54,117
Don't look!
Don't look!

442
00:30:57,304 --> 00:30:59,302
[Revenge]

443
00:31:05,045 --> 00:31:07,242
[Time's up!]

444
00:31:07,243 --> 00:31:10,373
Yoo Jae Suk and Girl's Day
passes the mission!

445
00:31:10,374 --> 00:31:12,892
[All members of Team Jae Suk passes,
and Joon of Team Kwang Soo passes.]

446
00:31:14,318 --> 00:31:17,298
I don't even know who this battle
is being fought for.

447
00:31:17,299 --> 00:31:18,905
[Who is this battle being fought for?]

448
00:31:18,906 --> 00:31:23,795
Now is a one on one battle between Kwang Soo
and Suk Jin to determine the last place.

449
00:31:23,796 --> 00:31:25,888
[Time to determine the last place winner-
Kwang Soo vs. Suk Jin.]

450
00:31:25,889 --> 00:31:28,797
- Suk Jin!
- Kwang Soo, fighting!

451
00:31:29,241 --> 00:31:30,541
Fighting!

452
00:31:30,542 --> 00:31:32,704
[Not even paying attention.]

453
00:31:35,341 --> 00:31:37,631
- Are you going to cheer him on?
- Oh! Fighting, Kwang Soo!

454
00:31:37,632 --> 00:31:38,798
Fighting!

455
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:40,328
You can do this!

456
00:31:40,329 --> 00:31:42,757
[Who will suffer the humiliation
of coming in at last place?]

457
00:31:48,576 --> 00:31:50,050
He landed on his belly.

458
00:31:51,476 --> 00:31:53,546
[Kwang Soo climbs up first for now.]

459
00:32:02,181 --> 00:32:03,774
[Where do you think you're going?]

460
00:32:12,943 --> 00:32:14,642
[But he shoves aside the attack
to pull himself on board!]

461
00:32:24,026 --> 00:32:26,818
[A real battle between the Easy Brothers
that we haven't seen in a long time!]

462
00:32:36,607 --> 00:32:37,896
[Is this the UFC championship?]

463
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:42,932
[Both of them look to be in pain.]

464
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:48,198
[By this point, it's a battle of pride!]

465
00:32:54,193 --> 00:32:55,500
That's a bloody fight.

466
00:32:56,109 --> 00:32:57,737
They don't have much time left.
They have to get up there quickly.

467
00:32:57,738 --> 00:33:00,358
[At this point, time is of the essence!]

468
00:33:04,554 --> 00:33:06,148
[Why is he taking off his shoe?]

469
00:33:07,142 --> 00:33:09,903
[A mannerly foot attack?]

470
00:33:10,635 --> 00:33:13,056
[A dirty, yet respectful attack!]

471
00:33:20,324 --> 00:33:23,289
Stop it.
Just stop it, Suk Jin!

472
00:33:27,468 --> 00:33:29,770
[Suk Jin isn't giving up!]

473
00:33:33,196 --> 00:33:34,808
[This isn't going to work!]

474
00:33:39,432 --> 00:33:41,899
[Throwing him off like a
sack of garbage.]

475
00:33:43,695 --> 00:33:47,439
[Team Kwang Soo and MBLAQ pass,
and they come in at sixth place!]

476
00:33:48,053 --> 00:33:49,899
Chansung and Woo Young are
in last place!

477
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:51,749
[Team Suk Jin and 2PM ultimately
come in at last place.]

478
00:33:52,839 --> 00:33:54,393
I'm sorry.

479
00:33:54,887 --> 00:33:56,664
I'll apologize to you over and over.

480
00:33:57,465 --> 00:34:00,041
[No need to apologize repeatedly...]

481
00:34:01,241 --> 00:34:03,961
I love our team!

482
00:34:03,962 --> 00:34:05,851
[It's okay.]

483
00:34:05,852 --> 00:34:08,112
- Who am I!
- I am champion!

484
00:34:11,192 --> 00:34:15,332
<i>The advantages you'll be given are all
different depending on your placement.</i>

485
00:34:15,333 --> 00:34:18,477
<i>Please come on out and take what's yours
depending on which place you came in at.</i>

486
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:24,903
[First place is, Ha Ha and Infinite.]

487
00:34:24,904 --> 00:34:27,833
[On the mysterious card is...]

488
00:34:27,834 --> 00:34:31,073
[100 seconds?]

489
00:34:31,074 --> 00:34:33,089
- The teams that tied for second place?
- Yes.

490
00:34:33,090 --> 00:34:35,959
[Second place tie- Team Ji Hyo, Beast;
Team Gary, A-Pink; Team Jong Kook, Sistar.]

491
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:38,743
[90 seconds.]

492
00:34:38,744 --> 00:34:40,656
- We came in at fifth place.
- Okay, here's fifth place.

493
00:34:40,657 --> 00:34:42,482
[Fifth place winners-
Team Jae Suk and Girl's Day.]

494
00:34:42,482 --> 00:34:45,860
[60 seconds.]

495
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:48,793
[Sixth place- Team Kwang Soo and MBLAQ
with 50 seconds.]

496
00:34:48,794 --> 00:34:50,257
Okay, and the team that came in
at last place?

497
00:34:50,258 --> 00:34:52,459
This is lucky number seven.

498
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:53,630
[Last place- 2PM and Suk Jin.]

499
00:34:53,631 --> 00:34:55,453
<i>This is your time card.
You have to take good care of the card</i>

500
00:34:55,454 --> 00:34:59,138
<i>and you have to turn it back in when
you arrive at your final destination.</i>

501
00:34:59,139 --> 00:35:00,361
Let's shout out our battle cry.

502
00:35:00,362 --> 00:35:03,922
- Who am I!
- I am champion!

503
00:35:10,994 --> 00:35:15,074
[Being greeted by Ha Ha and Infinite.]

504
00:35:15,937 --> 00:35:17,751
Hello.

505
00:35:19,073 --> 00:35:21,924
[Minah's face breaking into a huge smile.]

506
00:35:22,795 --> 00:35:24,058
- Minah.
- Yes?

507
00:35:24,059 --> 00:35:26,465
[Full of cheer.]

508
00:35:26,466 --> 00:35:28,612
Minah, why are you acting so
feminine all of a sudden?

509
00:35:28,913 --> 00:35:31,473
Did you just hear how you said
'hello' to them?

510
00:35:31,474 --> 00:35:32,940
I don't know what you're talking about.

511
00:35:34,252 --> 00:35:36,273
The team that'll be traveling alone is,
Team Kwang Soo and MBLAQ.

512
00:35:36,274 --> 00:35:39,395
[Team Kwang Soo and MBLAQ didn't get
chosen as traveling partners.]

513
00:35:41,718 --> 00:35:43,279
How can this be?

514
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,569
[How can this be...]

515
00:35:46,845 --> 00:35:48,642
But we're a pretty popular group.

516
00:35:49,676 --> 00:35:51,277
We'll show them at the next mission.

517
00:35:52,751 --> 00:35:54,993
Let's win and come in at first place,
then just opt to drive by ourselves.

518
00:35:54,994 --> 00:35:58,138
Okay, I agree. I don't
want to travel with them either.

519
00:35:59,749 --> 00:36:01,580
Here, this is for you girls.

520
00:36:01,581 --> 00:36:04,954
[Sharing sweet candy with
everyone in the car.]

521
00:36:05,373 --> 00:36:06,833
- Hey.
- It's a token of our affection.

522
00:36:06,834 --> 00:36:09,110
Shouldn't you be giving out
three pieces of candy up here?

523
00:36:13,085 --> 00:36:15,498
The atmosphere in here
is quite different, isn't it?

524
00:36:15,499 --> 00:36:16,586
Yeah, it's different than earlier.

525
00:36:16,587 --> 00:36:18,499
The atmosphere earlier...

526
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:21,312
- It was our first time seeing them.
- Who did you ride with earlier?

527
00:36:21,313 --> 00:36:22,934
- We rode with Girl's Day.
- Girl's Day.

528
00:36:22,935 --> 00:36:26,392
- Ah, Girl's Day?
- Those girls are so cutesy.

529
00:36:26,393 --> 00:36:28,042
They're so adorable.

530
00:36:28,911 --> 00:36:30,377
Should we get out?

531
00:36:35,004 --> 00:36:38,277
- We're not that cutesy.
- What does the 90 seconds mean?

532
00:36:38,278 --> 00:36:41,296
[What is the meaning behind the seconds
written on those cards from earlier?]

533
00:36:43,117 --> 00:36:46,478
- Do you think it has to do with a game?
- A game involving combining all the seconds?

534
00:36:46,479 --> 00:36:50,160
I think we're going to combine all the seconds
and when it's time to do something...

535
00:36:50,161 --> 00:36:51,356
I bet it's the time limit that we'll be
given to do something.

536
00:36:51,357 --> 00:36:55,040
- It'll be the time given to do something.
- Then the more seconds, the better?

537
00:36:55,041 --> 00:36:58,482
I think so. It's something that we have to
do within the time limit that we're given.

538
00:36:59,256 --> 00:37:02,437
[Just what is the meaning behind
those seconds that they're given?]

539
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:06,944
[The King of Idols-
Arrives at the second mission location.]

540
00:37:08,022 --> 00:37:09,598
- Look at this.
- Look at the inflatable thing.

541
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:11,691
[Hmm... what's this?]

542
00:37:11,692 --> 00:37:14,386
[A new repertoire in their list of games,
a blob jump!]

543
00:37:15,528 --> 00:37:16,991
It doesn't look that high.

544
00:37:16,992 --> 00:37:19,636
But the blob jump is no joke.
It's no joke once you're up there.

545
00:37:19,637 --> 00:37:22,120
Doesn't that look much higher than
it did the last time?

546
00:37:22,121 --> 00:37:25,262
[A much higher jumping post
than it was the last time?]

547
00:37:25,263 --> 00:37:28,785
- I think they've added at least another foot.
- I remember Woo Sung fell off twice.

548
00:37:29,544 --> 00:37:31,814
[Woo Sung's unexpected charm over
the new blob jump game.]

549
00:37:39,855 --> 00:37:42,609
<i>Your next mission is the Blob Jump.</i>

550
00:37:42,610 --> 00:37:45,476
[King of Idols- Second mission.
Blob Jump.]

551
00:37:45,477 --> 00:37:47,383
It's gotten higher since the last time.

552
00:37:47,498 --> 00:37:50,407
[Higher and bouncier than the last time!]

553
00:37:51,665 --> 00:37:55,014
Your order of winning will be determined by
how high you bounce off the platform.

554
00:37:55,015 --> 00:37:56,272
[Their order of winning will be determined
by how high they bounce?]

555
00:37:56,273 --> 00:38:00,293
To let you know about who we are,
we are 'Every day is a Girl's Day!'.

556
00:38:00,895 --> 00:38:02,786
That just comes out automatically.

557
00:38:04,912 --> 00:38:07,857
This is unfair to the teams that has
two female members on their team.

558
00:38:07,858 --> 00:38:10,553
The height of the jump varies on
the weight of the jumper.

559
00:38:10,553 --> 00:38:14,270
Then will there just be one jumper per team?

560
00:38:14,271 --> 00:38:16,295
[Just one jump opportunity per team!]

561
00:38:17,062 --> 00:38:20,097
[It's important to be careful about choosing
who your jumper and flier is going to be!]

562
00:38:21,263 --> 00:38:26,074
[It is important that the two jumpers are
in sync with their jumps.]

563
00:38:29,454 --> 00:38:33,153
[Practicing over and over again.]

564
00:38:33,836 --> 00:38:35,606
One, two, three.

565
00:38:37,837 --> 00:38:41,024
[Practicing as much as possible
before the real jump.]

566
00:38:44,376 --> 00:38:47,063
[The first team up-
Team Ha Ha and Infinite.]

567
00:38:49,095 --> 00:38:50,424
Fighting!

568
00:38:50,425 --> 00:38:53,266
[The fear is making scaredy cat Sung Gyu
lose his ability to think coherently.]

569
00:38:53,267 --> 00:38:54,948
Will you be alright, Sung Gyu?

570
00:38:55,335 --> 00:38:58,307
- Will you be alright?
- He's known for being a scaredy cat.

571
00:39:02,291 --> 00:39:04,064
Okay, here we go.

572
00:39:04,065 --> 00:39:06,363
[It's time for the show to start!]

573
00:39:09,517 --> 00:39:12,336
- Show us what you've got.
- I can't wait to see how they do.

574
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:19,127
[Just which idol team will throw their fear
in the wind to claim the throne as king?]

575
00:39:21,461 --> 00:39:23,151
Let's get ourselves in sync again.

576
00:39:23,152 --> 00:39:25,985
[Scaredy cat Sung Gyu letting out a scream
as soon as he steps onto the platform.]

577
00:39:26,736 --> 00:39:29,361
You have to jump right on three,
Sung Gyu.

578
00:39:29,362 --> 00:39:32,064
[Being the older one of the group,
Haroro is trying to show them his bravery.]

579
00:39:32,065 --> 00:39:34,472
[I can't hear a thing that you're saying...]

580
00:39:36,582 --> 00:39:40,822
['L', the human bullet positioning
himself on his launching spot.]

581
00:39:43,146 --> 00:39:46,041
- Fighting!
- Good luck!

582
00:39:46,806 --> 00:39:49,935
Is the film crew not ready yet,
or are you holding the film crew back?

583
00:39:51,398 --> 00:39:53,760
- Wait, hang on. Hang on!
- Come on up here.

584
00:39:54,118 --> 00:39:56,934
[Taking every ounce of his energy to take
that final step onto the jumping platform.]

585
00:39:56,935 --> 00:39:59,801
Sung Gyu!
You can't be afraid of it!

586
00:40:00,351 --> 00:40:02,644
[Frozen block of ice.]

587
00:40:04,245 --> 00:40:06,272
Get that expression off your face, Sung Gyu!

588
00:40:06,273 --> 00:40:08,378
You're stealing my expression!

589
00:40:08,379 --> 00:40:10,593
You're stealing my expression!

590
00:40:12,057 --> 00:40:14,761
If you use that expression right now,
what am I supposed to use when it's my turn?

591
00:40:15,472 --> 00:40:18,266
- Don't look down, Kwang Soo.
- Don't be afraid, Kwang Soo!

592
00:40:18,267 --> 00:40:21,642
[That's been my expression since
the beginning three years ago!]

593
00:40:23,298 --> 00:40:27,698
[But...
the expressions really are the same...]

594
00:40:27,699 --> 00:40:29,360
- Sung Gyu is really adorable.
- Yeah, he really is cute.

595
00:40:29,704 --> 00:40:30,928
Why are you getting worked up
over his expression?

596
00:40:30,929 --> 00:40:32,659
Do you have exclusive rights
to it or something?

597
00:40:33,081 --> 00:40:35,019
[When are they going to jump?]

598
00:40:36,148 --> 00:40:39,510
[Working up the courage to take
another step forward.]

599
00:40:47,026 --> 00:40:49,452
He's laughing deliriously now.

600
00:40:49,453 --> 00:40:52,860
- Look at him laughing.
- You're not sane right now, are you?

601
00:40:54,282 --> 00:40:56,914
[I'm not really laughing right now...]

602
00:40:57,323 --> 00:41:00,593
[My legs are going to burn at this rate.]

603
00:41:01,502 --> 00:41:03,586
- Okay, let's go.
- Fighting!

604
00:41:03,587 --> 00:41:05,124
Fighting!

605
00:41:06,052 --> 00:41:08,038
Once you're up there, cheers
like this are actually more annoying.

606
00:41:08,039 --> 00:41:10,268
You know when people cheer you on?
It's annoying.

607
00:41:10,269 --> 00:41:12,206
[True meaning beneath the cheer is,
'Just hurry up and jump'?]

608
00:41:12,207 --> 00:41:14,427
Just step up to the ledge first, Sung Gyu.
It's okay.

609
00:41:14,428 --> 00:41:16,372
- Sung Gyu!
- Just look off into the distance.

610
00:41:16,373 --> 00:41:18,555
You have to look up at the sky
when you jump.

611
00:41:19,559 --> 00:41:24,195
[Where is this place... and who am I?]

612
00:41:25,073 --> 00:41:27,637
You have to look up into the sky
as you're falling down onto the mat.

613
00:41:29,529 --> 00:41:33,781
[Blah, blah, blah...
Everyone adding their own two cents.]

614
00:41:33,782 --> 00:41:35,491
You have to jump
and lean yourselves back.

615
00:41:35,492 --> 00:41:37,237
Kick back as you jump off.

616
00:41:37,238 --> 00:41:40,618
- Just do it.
- Hurry up and do it!

617
00:41:42,372 --> 00:41:43,944
[Amount of time passed- Ten minutes.]

618
00:41:44,942 --> 00:41:48,328
[Are they finally jumping?]

619
00:41:48,329 --> 00:41:50,124
Wait, wait.

620
00:41:51,529 --> 00:41:56,865
- Sung Gyu, you just have to do it.
- I'm not the problem! He's the problem.

621
00:41:57,496 --> 00:42:00,109
[How did these two manage to meet?]

622
00:42:00,110 --> 00:42:01,952
Let's do this for real!

623
00:42:01,953 --> 00:42:03,876
- Let's just do this.
- Fighting!

624
00:42:07,198 --> 00:42:09,219
[Will they really do it this time?]

625
00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:11,520
[Here they go!]

626
00:42:20,932 --> 00:42:24,427
[They jumped!]

627
00:42:38,265 --> 00:42:43,531
[Infinite... flying into the sky!]

628
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:52,839
[They conquered their fears,
and flew into the sky!]

629
00:42:54,173 --> 00:42:55,953
Great job!

630
00:42:59,651 --> 00:43:01,894
[We're alive...]

631
00:43:03,344 --> 00:43:04,789
How high did I go?

632
00:43:05,578 --> 00:43:08,930
[L worrying about his record.]

633
00:43:08,931 --> 00:43:10,126
I didn't get that high?

634
00:43:10,927 --> 00:43:13,742
[On the other hand, these two are just
happy that they had the courage to jump.]

635
00:43:13,743 --> 00:43:18,144
[In a few moments, we will reveal the
height record for Team Ha Ha and Infinite.]

636
00:43:18,145 --> 00:43:21,188
Next up is, Team Suk Jin and 2PM!

637
00:43:21,189 --> 00:43:22,987
[Next up is, Team Suk Jin and 2PM.]

638
00:43:25,866 --> 00:43:29,810
[Jumpers- Suk Jin and Chansung.
Human bullet- Woo Young.]

639
00:43:31,707 --> 00:43:32,941
I'm nervous.

640
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:38,915
- We can do this.
- Yes, we can do this.

641
00:43:39,868 --> 00:43:42,299
Suk Jin.
How is it up there?

642
00:43:43,279 --> 00:43:45,844
- I'm nervous.
- I think I need to use the bathroom first.

643
00:43:46,776 --> 00:43:49,216
- It's scary up there.
- How did you ever jump this, Ha Ha?

644
00:43:49,814 --> 00:43:52,692
I just gritted my teeth and
thought of the person I love the most.

645
00:43:52,693 --> 00:43:54,865
I'm going to think of my son too.

646
00:43:55,430 --> 00:43:58,000
- Me too. I thought about my baby too.
- I want to be a cool dad for him.

647
00:43:58,001 --> 00:44:00,368
[Their reason for courage!
To be a cool dad for their kids!]

648
00:44:05,471 --> 00:44:06,866
Okay, great job.

649
00:44:07,532 --> 00:44:11,546
[Bullet Woo Young getting himself
into position?]

650
00:44:11,547 --> 00:44:13,982
Woo Young, since we have to do this
anyway, let's get first place.

651
00:44:15,214 --> 00:44:17,971
[Huh?
But his position is a bit...]

652
00:44:19,178 --> 00:44:23,194
[He has himself positioned backwards?]

653
00:44:23,195 --> 00:44:25,916
This is driving me crazy.
It'll be our turn soon.

654
00:44:28,662 --> 00:44:30,038
Okay, we're going to jump!

655
00:44:30,662 --> 00:44:31,905
Here we go!

656
00:44:33,369 --> 00:44:35,645
[His heart is starting to pound again
even just as a spectator.]

657
00:44:38,788 --> 00:44:41,152
- Think of Hyun Woo as you jump.
- I love you, Hyun Woo!

658
00:44:41,153 --> 00:44:42,898
I love you, Hyun Woo!

659

[Ready to jump!]

661

[Three flips in midair!]

666
00:45:28,112 --> 00:45:31,444
[That's 2PM!
A ten out of ten for his jump!]

667
00:45:39,236 --> 00:45:41,660
[Human two shot- Not even comparable to
Woo Young's dashing flying act.]

668
00:45:43,224 --> 00:45:44,941

[Next up- Jae Suk and Girl's Day.]

672
00:45:56,128 --> 00:46:00,282
[Jumpers- Jae Suk and Yura.
Human bullet- Minah.]

673
00:46:05,995 --> 00:46:08,987
[Yura doesn't seem to be too nervous.]

674
00:46:10,224 --> 00:46:14,220
- Are you okay, Yura?
- Yes. It doesn't seem that high up.

675
00:46:16,282 --> 00:46:18,926
- Is she not nervous?
- No, Yura's not nervous.

676
00:46:21,709 --> 00:46:24,908
[Minah's already excited at the
thought of flying into the sky.]

677
00:46:33,538 --> 00:46:37,375
- But it's not as high up as you'd think.
- Really?

678
00:46:38,336 --> 00:46:42,016
[If you say it like that,
then what does that make of us?]

679
00:46:42,017 --> 00:46:46,916
- Scoot up a bit more, Minah.
- Can you give me a sign before you jump?

680
00:46:46,917 --> 00:46:48,677
- We'll count to three really loud.
- Okay.

681
00:46:51,614 --> 00:46:53,963
Are you jumping after three,
or are you jumping on three?

682
00:46:53,964 --> 00:46:58,074
- After we count to three.
- One, two, three, jump.

683
00:46:58,075 --> 00:46:59,767
- Three.
- Okay.

684
00:47:00,665 --> 00:47:01,913
Here we go!

685

[Now that she knows it's time to jump,
she automatically breaks out in screams.]

686
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:13,324
[Gathering in one last deep breath...]

687
00:47:13,325 --> 00:47:16,350
- You have to just do it!
- Fighting!

688
00:47:16,940 --> 00:47:20,769
One, two, three!

689
00:47:30,477 --> 00:47:32,885
[Wow, a vertical toss into the air!]

690
00:47:39,810 --> 00:47:41,887
[An unbelievable height!]

691

[Predicting an unbelievable record.]

[A clean dive into the water as if
he's taking part in a diving competition.]

702
00:48:45,218 --> 00:48:47,407

some weight to her after all.

703
00:48:48,134 --> 00:48:51,429
[Superwoman Eun Ji to be the
human bullet for Team Gary and A-Pink.]

scored the highest record?]

[There's the 'Idiot Expression' again!

human bullet again with all guy jumpers.]

- You have to jump one more time.
- Why? What?

738
00:51:26,310 --> 00:51:30,081

- Have Woo Young jump one more time.

739
00:51:30,082 --> 00:51:32,494
[We just want a good show.]

Don't you think we already know that?

747
00:52:03,715 --> 00:52:07,136
[His nonstop nagging before they
even had the chance to jump.]

748
00:52:08,508 --> 00:52:10,142

749
00:52:10,821 --> 00:52:13,947
- Fighting!
- He looks so ugly next to all the idols.

750

[Everyone's ready to go!]

751
00:52:20,506 --> 00:52:24,232

- That was good.
- That was so cool.

758

much higher than they anticipated.]

772

[In fourth place- 6m 40cm.
Team Ha Ha and Infinite.]

773
00:54:13,193 --> 00:54:14,871

we thought.

774
00:54:15,466 --> 00:54:18,803
[Team Ha Ha and Infinite
earns themselves a 40 second card.]

775
00:54:19,287 --> 00:54:23,055
- You guys must've done well.
- It's because of my big head.

776
00:54:23,056 --> 00:54:25,686
Then it means that Jong Kook and his team
got higher than 7m?

[It's between Team Jong Kook, Sistar
and Team Jae Suk, Girl's Day for first place.]

781

Stop comparing the two of us like this.

782
00:54:47,351 --> 00:54:51,575
[Nonstop bickering between Jae Suk
and Kkuk as expected by everyone.]

783
00:54:51,576 --> 00:54:54,115
- Come on, seriously!
- Okay, it's above 7m.

784
00:54:54,116 --> 00:54:58,418
[Which idol team scored the highest record

00:55:10,866 --> 00:55:14,446
[First place winners in Blob Jump mission is,
Team Jae Suk and Girl's Day!]

789

Every day is... Girl's Day!

791
00:55:19,009 --> 00:55:21,255
It's okay.
We came in at second place.

792
00:55:23,570 --> 00:55:26,656
[A whopping 70 seconds
for first place winners!]

793
00:55:26,657 --> 00:55:29,397
[Second place winners- 60 seconds.]

794
00:55:31,577 --> 00:55:36,634
[But what is the meaning of
all these time cards?]

795
00:55:39,213 --> 00:55:42,935
[Team Kwang Soo, MBLAQ and Team
Gary, A-Pink traveling together in one car.]

796

- What do you think that all means?
- We have a total of 110 seconds.

798
00:55:47,613 --> 00:55:49,558
We're behind you guys by ten seconds.

799
00:55:49,559 --> 00:55:53,242
I thought that it meant that we had to
eat our lunch within 110 seconds.

800
00:55:55,321 --> 00:55:57,456
You're so obsessed with eating.

801
00:55:58,443 --> 00:56:01,791
We lost because Woo Young was too focused
on looking cool rather than flying high.

802
00:56:02,996 --> 00:56:06,886
[Team Suk Jin and 2PM with a total
of 50 seconds for their combined time.]

[Looking pathetic for some reason...]

805
00:56:13,445 --> 00:56:16,462
- Your combined time is 50 seconds?
- What are the seconds for anyhow?

806
00:56:16,812 --> 00:56:18,916
I'm not sure,
but I think the more time the better.

807
00:56:18,917 --> 00:56:20,932
[Not sure of the meaning behind time,
but the more time the better?]

808
00:56:20,933 --> 00:56:22,063
Should we just keep going
for the artistic points then?

809
00:56:22,472 --> 00:56:25,093
- Since we're already in last place...
- But don't you think we need some time?

810
00:56:25,094 --> 00:56:28,275
Instead of coming in at ambiguous 4th or 5th,
let's just go for the last place.

811

- Let's just go for it then.
- Let's go for the artistic points.

What are we doing here?

816
00:56:41,215 --> 00:56:43,492
Is it somebody's birthday today?

817
00:56:44,475 --> 00:56:47,512
[Choongbu University]

818
00:56:47,513 --> 00:56:49,196

822
00:57:27,012 --> 00:57:28,229
<i>Everyone.</i>

823
00:57:28,644 --> 00:57:31,356
<i>This is... Choongbu University.</i>

824
00:57:32,976 --> 00:57:37,659
<i>Your next mission will take place here at
Choongbu University facing the end of summer.</i>

825
00:57:38,143 --> 00:57:40,258
<i>Your mission is, Prime Dodge ball.</i>

826
00:57:40,259 --> 00:57:42,162
[Prime Dodge ball.]

827
00:57:42,163 --> 00:57:46,370
<i>But... this mission isn't just
going to be about the teams.</i>

828
00:57:48,115 --> 00:57:51,726
<i>But all 21 of you will enter within
the boundaries of the dodge ball field</i>

829
00:57:51,727 --> 00:57:57,370
<i>and you have to avoid the flying dodge balls
to remain alive until the end of the game.</i>

830
00:57:59,943 --> 00:58:01,542
- That's absurd.
- This is crazy.

831
00:58:01,543 --> 00:58:02,741
I'm scared!

832
00:58:07,896 --> 00:58:14,082
[A total of 52 university students gathered
to play the game of Prime Dodge ball.]

833
00:58:14,956 --> 00:58:16,866
No!

834
00:58:19,712 --> 00:58:21,272
How are we supposed to avoid
being hit by their throws?

835
00:58:26,813 --> 00:58:30,004
[Surrounding them teams in an
straight and orderly manner.]

836
00:58:32,564 --> 00:58:36,496
<i>The balls that you'll all have
to be dodging...</i>

837
00:58:36,929 --> 00:58:42,900
<i>will be thrown by these students who are very
angry about their summer vacation ending.</i>

838
00:58:42,901 --> 00:58:44,829
Please don't be angry!

839
00:58:45,696 --> 00:58:47,202
Please calm down!

840

<i>The team that avoids being hit by the ball
to remain alive to the very end...</i>

841
00:58:55,137 --> 00:58:56,447
<i>will be the winner of this mission.</i>

842
00:58:56,448 --> 00:59:01,784
<i>So ultimately, the very first team to get
eliminated will be in last place. Okay?</i>

843
00:59:02,433 --> 00:59:05,783
[Please go easy on us...]

[Prime Dodge ball- Start!]

847
00:59:38,922 --> 00:59:42,562
[The whole crowd moving along
with each small movement of the ball.]

848
00:59:47,477 --> 00:59:50,903
[The strange sense of terror that comes from
unknown directions of the 104 hands.]

849
00:59:54,433 --> 00:59:57,758
[Idol members scurrying around in fear.]

850
01:00:04,250 --> 01:00:05,982

[A direct hit on Yura of
Team Jae Suk and Girl's Day!]

852
01:00:17,687 --> 01:00:19,981
- I got hit!
- Step outside the lines, Yura.

853
01:00:27,841 --> 01:00:30,009
[Muscle Boy and his quick moves.]

854
01:00:31,411 --> 01:00:33,342
- The ball is curving.
- The wind is giving the ball a curve.

855
01:00:36,634 --> 01:00:39,169
[Passing the ball around to confuse them?]

856
01:00:40,831 --> 01:00:42,064
[Woo Young in danger!]

857
01:00:43,007 --> 01:00:45,001
[A direct hit!]

858

[Woo Young of Team Suk Jin and 2PM- Out!]

859
01:00:52,109 --> 01:00:55,730
[19 others are still in the game!]

860
01:00:58,013 --> 01:01:01,178
[Chansung's dodge results
in a direct hit on Kwang Soo!]

[A direct hit on Eun Ji.]

863
01:01:20,744 --> 01:01:22,281
You're hitting the girls too hard!

864

Look here!

865
01:01:26,756 --> 01:01:28,200
How could he have done that?

866
01:01:31,326 --> 01:01:33,630
Why couldn't I have avoided the ball?

867
01:01:38,364 --> 01:01:39,965
[Big-nosed Brother is out!]

868

of Team Suk Jin and 2PM.]

874

[14 survivors left in the game.]

875
01:02:07,827 --> 01:02:10,754
[Harder to get a hit
with fewer people left in the game.]

876
01:02:11,350 --> 01:02:14,043
They have to throw as soon as the ball is
in their hands to get a hit.

877
01:02:14,279 --> 01:02:16,636
Please let me back in the game!

the joining of the eliminated players.]

884

[Wow... one student aiming
for Mr. Capable?]

895
01:03:38,688 --> 01:03:40,280
[An immediate smile on his face.]

896
01:03:47,557 --> 01:03:52,391
[Eun Ji ousts Sung Gyu!]

897
01:03:52,392 --> 01:03:55,836
[No mercy in the face of victory!]

898
01:03:56,578 --> 01:03:57,877

Why did you oust Gary!

904
01:04:24,198 --> 01:04:26,310
[Na Eun is the only survivor left of
Team Gary and A-Pink.]

905
01:04:26,311 --> 01:04:29,708
<i>There are four teams that only have
one surviving member left on their team.</i>

906
01:04:29,709 --> 01:04:30,998
We have to oust the orange team.

907
01:04:30,999 --> 01:04:32,768
There are too many
orange team members left in the game!

908
01:04:32,768 --> 01:04:35,928
- Everyone, what color?
- Orange!

909
01:04:35,929 --> 01:04:38,159

You guys are being too harsh!

912

I randomly hear people screaming out,
'Kill them' here and there.

913
01:04:46,757 --> 01:04:50,140
Why are you saying that?
What wrong have we ever done you guys?

914
01:04:50,663 --> 01:04:53,251
[Even though we can understand that you're
angry about your summer vacation ending...]

915
01:04:53,252 --> 01:04:55,235
We're not the ones ending
your summer vacation here.

916
01:04:55,235 --> 01:04:57,354
[In a violent state of mind over their
rage of the summer vacation ending.]

917
01:04:59,296 --> 01:05:01,697
You guys are all being too violent.

918
01:05:02,249 --> 01:05:03,831
There's no need for you to want to kill us.

919
01:05:04,423 --> 01:05:07,082
You guys all look like such nice people!

920
01:05:08,012 --> 01:05:11,430
<i>Teams with only one member left need to
work hard to stay in the game.</i>

921
01:05:11,431 --> 01:05:12,847

the game again.</i>

922

[Everyone's common goal is... orange!]

924
01:05:20,488 --> 01:05:23,691
Here's what we're going to do.
Everyone start passing the ball around.

925
01:05:25,205 --> 01:05:26,713
Throw it as soon as you catch it.

926
01:05:26,714 --> 01:05:29,172
[Counting on a plan of confusion
from rapid ball pass play.]

927
01:05:32,639 --> 01:05:35,348
Don't even think about it,
and just pass the ball.

928
01:05:38,771 --> 01:05:41,150
[Danger everywhere!]

929
01:05:43,866 --> 01:05:46,644
[Ah... way out of bounds.]

930
01:05:57,379 --> 01:05:58,693
Throw it immediately.

931
01:05:58,694 --> 01:06:00,513
Nice, as soon as you catch it.

932
01:06:00,514 --> 01:06:02,393
Immediately. Nice!

933
01:06:08,596 --> 01:06:11,135
[With their quick pass play,
Ki Kwang is out!]

934
01:06:12,204 --> 01:06:14,253
[I did it!]

935
01:06:17,349 --> 01:06:19,689
Let's ride the wave!

936
01:06:19,743 --> 01:06:23,159
[Time to ride the wave!]

937
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:36,602
[Since he's already riding the wave,
time to take it to the stands!]

938
01:06:36,603 --> 01:06:38,400
He really loves doing things like that.

939
01:06:43,570 --> 01:06:47,406
[Wave of a gigantic proportions.]

940
01:06:58,608 --> 01:07:01,628

[Where is he aiming the ball?]

945
01:07:26,150 --> 01:07:28,534
- Why aren't you hitting anyone?
- You guys are being too meek.

946
01:07:28,535 --> 01:07:31,744
- Throw it immediately!
- Nice.

947
01:07:36,097 --> 01:07:38,282
[Jae Suk- Out!]

948
01:07:39,511 --> 01:07:40,780

993
01:10:24,577 --> 01:10:29,154
<i>Since there aren't many survivors left,
to help you with your throwing aim</i>

994
01:10:29,155 --> 01:10:31,112
<i>we're going to tighten the
boundary lines for the game.</i>

995
01:10:34,262 --> 01:10:36,274
This is your chance, everyone!

996
01:10:37,146 --> 01:10:39,036
Let's finish this quickly and go eat!

997
01:10:43,730 --> 01:10:47,034
Ready, set, go!
[Only five survivors left in the game.]

998
01:10:49,348 --> 01:10:51,136
[Chansung's quick moves.]

999
01:10:52,188 --> 01:10:53,885
This is really scary.

1000
01:10:58,772 --> 01:11:02,220
[Ah... L is out!]

1001
01:11:03,312 --> 01:11:04,608
Good job.

1002
01:11:06,161 --> 01:11:07,876
- Infinite is out.
- Too bad.

1003
01:11:08,708 --> 01:11:11,521
[Only four survivors left in the game.
Blank Ji is truly amazing.]

1004
01:11:11,522 --> 01:11:13,414
- Where's the ball?
- Over there.

1005
01:11:22,782 --> 01:11:25,100
[Be careful of your own team member!]

1006
01:11:27,778 --> 01:11:29,651
[Almost aimed for
his own teammate, Chansung.]

1007
01:11:32,486 --> 01:11:35,580
[Muscle Boy still doing a good job
of avoiding the ball.]

1008
01:11:37,629 --> 01:11:39,915
We have to get Jong Kook.

1009
01:11:41,145 --> 01:11:44,517
[Ah... the lone female survivor,
Blank Ji is out!]

1010
01:11:45,983 --> 01:11:47,959
That guy is ousting all the female players.

1011
01:11:47,960 --> 01:11:50,102
I want to speak to you after the game.

1012
01:11:50,883 --> 01:11:52,140
I want to talk to you after the game.

1013
01:11:53,131 --> 01:11:56,230
[Can't believe that
Joon is still in the game...]

1014
01:11:56,231 --> 01:11:58,870
Jong Kook is our next goal!

1015
01:11:58,871 --> 01:12:01,512
This is the time when first through
third place will be determined.

1016
01:12:01,513 --> 01:12:03,886
- Let's win first place, Chansung!
- Pass the ball around!

1017
01:12:08,447 --> 01:12:10,404
[Giraffe getting too overly excited.]

1018
01:12:14,524 --> 01:12:15,790
Wait, wait.

1019
01:12:17,042 --> 01:12:19,176
[Only three survivors left in the game.]

1020
01:12:21,476 --> 01:12:23,052
[Huh?]

1021
01:12:24,694 --> 01:12:27,312
[Prepping for another cartoon
dodge ball move?]

1022
01:12:27,313 --> 01:12:29,744
[The fire ball?]

1023
01:12:37,010 --> 01:12:39,423
[The fire ball's demise.]

1024
01:12:45,492 --> 01:12:48,142
There you go.
Stay calm everyone.

1025
01:12:59,314 --> 01:13:03,139
[Oh... Big-nosed Brother ousts Muscle Boy!]

1026
01:13:05,251 --> 01:13:10,107
Ji Suk Jin!

1027
01:13:10,108 --> 01:13:12,884
[A huge celebration breaks out.]

1028
01:13:13,777 --> 01:13:16,038
[Team Jong Kook and Sistar in third place.]

1029
01:13:17,100 --> 01:13:19,926
[The final two survivors-
Chansung vs. Lee Joon.]

1030
01:13:21,214 --> 01:13:25,066
This is the first time I've ever seen Joon
survive this long on our show.

1031
01:13:25,785 --> 01:13:27,902
[Will it be ditzy Joon...]

1032
01:13:28,573 --> 01:13:30,439
[Or fast footed beast, Chansung?]

1033
01:13:30,811 --> 01:13:32,949
[The ultimate battle starts now!]

1034
01:13:39,524 --> 01:13:41,538
[An ambush throw by
Joon's teammate, Seung Ho!]

1035
01:13:42,705 --> 01:13:45,036
[A perfectly aimed throw at Chansung!]

1036
01:13:49,494 --> 01:13:51,520
[This is dangerous...]

1037
01:13:57,494 --> 01:13:59,227
[A direct hit!]

1038
01:14:02,672 --> 01:14:05,816
[The final survivor, Lee Joon!]

1039
01:14:09,699 --> 01:14:14,348
[Team Kwang Soo and MBLAQ
come in at first place!]

1040
01:14:15,819 --> 01:14:18,419
[A round of applause to the victors.]

1041
01:14:18,420 --> 01:14:19,714
You were awesome, Chansung.

1042
01:14:24,320 --> 01:14:28,260
Thank you so much to all the students
who made this game possible.

1043
01:14:29,625 --> 01:14:32,966
[Time to hand out the time card
to the first place winners.]

1044
01:14:34,399 --> 01:14:37,287
[Overly excited at this rare and
unexpected turn of events.]

1045
01:14:38,404 --> 01:14:39,576
Hurry!

1046
01:14:45,770 --> 01:14:53,099
[Thank you to everyone for cheering us on.]

1047
01:15:00,618 --> 01:15:03,232
[Time for the final mission!]

1048
01:15:06,212 --> 01:15:07,902
<i>It is now time for the final mission.</i>

1049
01:15:09,074 --> 01:15:12,221
<i>Are we going to start the game
in the order that we're in right now?</i>

1050
01:15:14,507 --> 01:15:19,965
[With the time cards that they've
been able to gain thus far...]

1051
01:15:19,966 --> 01:15:25,654
[It is time to determine...]

1052
01:15:25,655 --> 01:15:30,830
[The ultimate victor.]

1053
01:15:31,390 --> 01:15:33,133
[Huh?]

1054
01:15:33,134 --> 01:15:34,737
I'm here on my own.

1055
01:15:36,355 --> 01:15:41,582
My Girl's Day team members...
have an event scheduled overseas.

1056
01:15:41,583 --> 01:15:47,110
Since they have their schedule to get to,
I have to finish this race on my own.

1057
01:15:47,111 --> 01:15:50,204
[Yoo Hyuk to complete the final mission
all on his own.]

1058
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:53,171
I may be able to win first place
so don't worry about me being alone.

1059
01:15:53,868 --> 01:15:55,429
- Good luck with your event.
- You have to win the race, okay?

1060
01:15:55,430 --> 01:15:57,923
[If things had gone according to plan,
they could've finished the race together...]

1061
01:15:57,924 --> 01:16:00,682
- I'll send you the gold if I win.
- There's a gold prize?

1062
01:16:03,685 --> 01:16:06,055
[Thus... Yoo Hyuk is alone.]

1063
01:16:06,701 --> 01:16:09,119
<i>Then please carry on for your team members
by doing their impersonation as well.</i>

1064
01:16:09,119 --> 01:16:11,517
What do you mean, impersonate them?
What are you talking about?

1065
01:16:11,517 --> 01:16:13,439
<i>Okay, for your final mission...</i>

1066
01:16:13,667 --> 01:16:15,661
<i>Time is Gold.</i>

1067
01:16:15,662 --> 01:16:19,903
[Final mission- Time is Gold.]

1068
01:16:19,904 --> 01:16:24,025
<i>Throughout the day today, you've
won yourselves the time cards, right?</i>

1069
01:16:24,481 --> 01:16:28,278
<i>If you combine all the time cards
that you've gained thus far...</i>

1070
01:16:28,278 --> 01:16:33,961
<i>that's the total time that your team
has to complete your mission.</i>

1071
01:16:33,962 --> 01:16:36,140
[This is their allotted time
to complete their mission!]

1072
01:16:36,141 --> 01:16:38,716
<i>That means, the more time you have,
more advantageous it is for you.</i>

1073
01:16:39,406 --> 01:16:42,902
<i>You'll see different colored cages
set up behind where you're standing.</i>

1074
01:16:47,473 --> 01:16:51,888
<i>Starting with the team with the most time,
each team will go into that cage...</i>

1075
01:16:52,867 --> 01:16:54,799
<i>and unravel the knotted rope...</i>

1076
01:16:54,800 --> 01:16:58,980
<i>and once that's done,
come back to the table set in front of it...</i>

1077
01:17:02,393 --> 01:17:05,795
<i>to complete the traditional game
that's placed on top of the table.</i>

1078
01:17:06,657 --> 01:17:10,041
<i>And once the game has been completed,
a key will fall out onto the table.</i>

1079
01:17:10,042 --> 01:17:11,839
<i>Once you've gained the key</i>

1080
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:17,421
<i>come up to the King of Idols flag,
and turn the key in the lock</i>

1081
01:17:17,748 --> 01:17:21,808
<i>to pull out the flag from its stand.
The team that gets the flag wins the race.</i>

1082
01:17:21,808 --> 01:17:23,741
<i>- Does everyone understand the rules?
- Yes.</i>

1083
01:17:23,751 --> 01:17:28,152
<i>Okay, the team with the most time
will first head towards their cage</i>

1084
01:17:28,153 --> 01:17:30,238
<i>and wait on standby for the
game to start.</i>

1085
01:17:30,254 --> 01:17:33,177
<i>Everyone, please turn in
your time cards.</i>

1086
01:17:33,178 --> 01:17:35,743
<i>In first place is,
Team Jong Kook and Sistar.</i>

1087
01:17:35,744 --> 01:17:41,397
[In first place-
Team Jong Kook and Sistar.]

1088
01:17:41,398 --> 01:17:43,193
- 200 seconds.
- Okay, 200 seconds.

1089
01:17:43,194 --> 01:17:45,568
<i>- Please turn in your cards.
- 200 seconds?</i>

1090
01:17:46,161 --> 01:17:48,972
<i>Stake your flag in the cage,
and ready yourselves behind the cage.</i>

1091
01:17:50,028 --> 01:17:51,599
<i>And the team in second place?</i>

1092
01:17:51,913 --> 01:17:54,234
<i>Team Ha Ha and Infinite.</i>

1093
01:17:54,235 --> 01:17:56,308
<i>And also,
Team Kwang Soo and MBLAQ.</i>

1094
01:17:56,309 --> 01:17:57,940
<i>How many seconds do you have?</i>

1095
01:17:58,327 --> 01:18:00,483
- We have...
- 170 seconds.

1096
01:18:00,484 --> 01:18:03,188
- How many seconds to you have?
- We also have 170 seconds.

1097
01:18:04,629 --> 01:18:07,137
<i>And the next team with
the most allotted time is...</i>

1098
01:18:07,704 --> 01:18:09,500
<i>Team Ji Hyo and Beast.</i>

1099
01:18:09,501 --> 01:18:12,187
- How many seconds do you have?
- 160 seconds.

1100
01:18:12,188 --> 01:18:15,968
<i>160 seconds is more than plenty...</i>

1101
01:18:16,376 --> 01:18:19,149
What am I supposed to do
on my own here?

1102
01:18:20,262 --> 01:18:22,442
<i>You said you'll win first place
all on your own earlier.</i>

1103
01:18:22,443 --> 01:18:26,093
I was just saying that.
I can't win this game on my own.

1104
01:18:26,126 --> 01:18:30,647
<i>Okay, the fifth team with the most
allotted amount of time is...</i>

1105
01:18:30,648 --> 01:18:32,336
<i>Team Girl's Day.</i>

1106
01:18:32,337 --> 01:18:35,728
[In fifth place, Team Girl's Day.]

1107
01:18:35,729 --> 01:18:37,442
I have 150 seconds.

1108
01:18:38,895 --> 01:18:43,004
- Can you shout out your team's battle cry?
- How am I to do that? I'm here by myself.

1109
01:18:43,883 --> 01:18:45,906
[We're not alone!]

1110
01:18:45,907 --> 01:18:48,556
How am I supposed to shout out,
'Every day is a Girl's Day' alone?

1111
01:18:49,527 --> 01:18:51,805
- Every day is Jae Suk's day.
- Good luck playing by yourself.

1112
01:18:51,805 --> 01:18:54,294
Every day... is alone day!

1113
01:18:55,736 --> 01:18:57,328
I can't believe I have to do this alone.

1114
01:18:57,329 --> 01:18:59,055
We're not in last place!

1115
01:18:59,653 --> 01:19:02,262
- We're not in last place.
- Are you teasing us right now?

1116
01:19:02,981 --> 01:19:05,403
- We have 120 seconds.
- That's only a 10 second difference.

1117
01:19:05,404 --> 01:19:06,802
- We have 110 seconds.
- 110 seconds.

1118
01:19:06,803 --> 01:19:09,230
[In final place- Team Suk Jin
and 2PM with 110 seconds.]

1119
01:19:09,231 --> 01:19:11,153
<i>Everyone to the start line.</i>

1120
01:19:11,154 --> 01:19:14,824
<i>The first team to complete this mission
will be the ultimate winner.</i>

1121
01:19:15,060 --> 01:19:19,501
<i>You must check the light on your cage,
and we'll start at the sound of my whistle.</i>

1122
01:19:20,156 --> 01:19:21,331
Ready.

1123
01:19:23,439 --> 01:19:26,833
[Green light on Team Sistar's cage!]

1124
01:19:31,542 --> 01:19:33,084
We have to remain calm.

1125
01:19:33,085 --> 01:19:34,596
Let's stay calm.

1126
01:19:34,597 --> 01:19:36,970
[Team Sistar with the most amount
of allotted time to complete the mission.]

1127
01:19:38,823 --> 01:19:40,718
- I think I've got the hang of this.
- Really?

1128
01:19:42,358 --> 01:19:45,098
[Team Suk Jin and 2PM feeling anxious
with their measly 110 seconds.]

1129
01:19:46,430 --> 01:19:48,588
This is all knotted very tight.

1130
01:19:49,052 --> 01:19:51,344
You can't try to force it.
You have to lightly unravel it.

1131
01:19:54,446 --> 01:19:56,969
[Everyone's light still remains red...]

1132
01:19:57,686 --> 01:19:59,215
This is making me feel very anxious.

1133
01:20:05,461 --> 01:20:07,361
[At last...]

1134
01:20:07,362 --> 01:20:10,860
[Time for Team Ha Ha and Infinite
to start!]

1135
01:20:12,369 --> 01:20:13,511
Our turn?

1136
01:20:13,598 --> 01:20:17,362
[Team Kwang Soo and MBLAQ
also starts their mission.]

1137
01:20:17,363 --> 01:20:19,510
You have to push the knot through.

1138
01:20:20,530 --> 01:20:21,647
Quickly, quickly!

1139
01:20:24,795 --> 01:20:26,123
How do I unravel this?

1140
01:20:27,522 --> 01:20:29,322
- You're really fast.
- Quickly.

1141
01:20:29,323 --> 01:20:31,035
Okay, I'm almost done here.

1142
01:20:35,482 --> 01:20:38,972
[Hyorin showing some talent in
unraveling the knots.]

1143
01:20:40,913 --> 01:20:42,663
- Ki Kwang!
- What is it?

1144
01:20:43,382 --> 01:20:46,355
[Team Ji Hyo and Beast- Start the mission!]

1145
01:20:48,701 --> 01:20:50,181
Let's remain calm.

1146
01:20:50,924 --> 01:20:52,527
It doesn't look like it's very easy.

1147
01:20:52,928 --> 01:20:55,544
How am I supposed to do this alone when
all three of them are struggling over there?

1148
01:20:58,537 --> 01:21:01,328
[Team Beast working quickly
to unravel their knots.]

1149
01:21:01,329 --> 01:21:02,537
Okay, it's my turn!

1150
01:21:04,002 --> 01:21:07,655
[Finally time for
'Every day is Jae Suk's Day' to start!]

1151
01:21:08,488 --> 01:21:10,220
How am I supposed to unravel this knot?

1152
01:21:12,083 --> 01:21:14,066
How did they even tie this knot?

1153
01:21:14,067 --> 01:21:16,242
We're next.
We're up next.

1154
01:21:18,744 --> 01:21:20,801
The more I unravel it,
more knotted it's becoming.

1155
01:21:25,037 --> 01:21:28,662
[Team Sistar calmly unraveling
all their knots.]

1156
01:21:30,016 --> 01:21:31,657
This too?
Do we have to unravel all this too?

1157
01:21:36,926 --> 01:21:38,639
Wow, Ji Hyo.
You're really good at this.

1158
01:21:41,260 --> 01:21:44,204
[All around Ace Ji Hyo is good at
even unraveling stubborn knots.]

1159
01:21:47,772 --> 01:21:48,809
Quickly!

1160
01:21:49,509 --> 01:21:52,637
[Finally time for
Team Gary and A-Pink to start!]

1161
01:21:55,215 --> 01:21:56,953
We don't have enough time.

1162
01:21:57,523 --> 01:22:00,075
- No, don't think like that.
- Okay, I'll relax.

1163
01:22:01,521 --> 01:22:04,835
This is... a time for us to build
more memories.

1164
01:22:07,307 --> 01:22:08,497
It's our turn.

1165
01:22:08,498 --> 01:22:12,155
[And finally, it's Team 2PM's turn.]

1166
01:22:13,521 --> 01:22:15,244
Okay, I'm getting this side.

1167
01:22:17,497 --> 01:22:19,282
Let's win this.
Let's really win this.

1168
01:22:21,152 --> 01:22:23,076
[It is now, a full on battle!]

1169
01:22:23,996 --> 01:22:27,129
[Team Sistar is ahead of everyone else
from having been the first ones to start.]

1170
01:22:27,130 --> 01:22:28,585
You're really quick.

1171
01:22:28,586 --> 01:22:30,286
Why isn't this unraveling?

1172
01:22:30,287 --> 01:22:31,866
How am I supposed to do this one?

1173
01:22:31,867 --> 01:22:33,878
We have to work fast.

1174
01:22:33,879 --> 01:22:36,415
Wow, this is unbelievable.

1175
01:22:37,705 --> 01:22:40,248
[And this one person...]

1176
01:22:42,047 --> 01:22:45,193
[A frustrating world of knots
to handle all on his own.]

1177
01:22:47,719 --> 01:22:50,264
[I want to cry.]

1178
01:22:51,076 --> 01:22:52,692
Girl's Day, fighting!

1179
01:22:53,635 --> 01:22:55,813
<i>Stay strong, Team Girl's Day.</i>

1180
01:23:00,101 --> 01:23:02,694
[Now resorting to the usage of his teeth.]

1181
01:23:06,248 --> 01:23:07,821
Okay, I'm getting this now.

1182
01:23:07,822 --> 01:23:09,307
- Mine's unraveling now.
- I'm really getting this.

1183
01:23:09,308 --> 01:23:11,665
Get greedy with it.
Get greedy!

1184
01:23:11,666 --> 01:23:13,309
I am starting to feel greedy.

1185
01:23:13,310 --> 01:23:15,491
[While all the top teams are struggling,
the bottom teams are remaining driven.]

1186
01:23:15,492 --> 01:23:20,472
[Must unravel all the knots before
they can pass the first course.]

1187
01:23:21,003 --> 01:23:24,167
[Which team will be the first
to pass through the first course?]

1188
01:23:24,168 --> 01:23:26,265
[Team Sistar almost finished
with their course.]

1189
01:23:27,426 --> 01:23:29,656
[Team 2PM having unraveled
quite a good portion of the knots.]

1190
01:23:32,148 --> 01:23:33,557
Okay, we're moving along here.

1191
01:23:34,479 --> 01:23:36,558
I can't see anything over here.

1192
01:23:37,079 --> 01:23:39,835
[Wow, look at Blank Ji's hands move!]

1193
01:23:39,836 --> 01:23:41,533
We were doing such a good job!

1194
01:23:47,381 --> 01:23:48,922
[Team Ji Hyo and Beast completes
unraveling all their knots!]

1195
01:23:48,923 --> 01:23:50,274
Raise the bar.

1196
01:23:54,881 --> 01:23:57,869
[Succeeds in escaping their first course.]

1197
01:23:57,870 --> 01:24:00,159
[Team Ji Hyo and Beast are in first place!]

1198
01:24:02,247 --> 01:24:04,489
[Second course- Puzzle time.]

1199
01:24:07,079 --> 01:24:08,503
They're already out?

1200
01:24:11,160 --> 01:24:12,445
Okay, good!

1201
01:24:12,446 --> 01:24:14,853
[Team Kwang Soo and MBLAQ
are also finished!]

1202
01:24:14,854 --> 01:24:17,969
[Heading straight towards the puzzle.]

1203
01:24:20,145 --> 01:24:21,322
This is the last knot.

1204
01:24:23,442 --> 01:24:24,467
Okay, we got it.

1205
01:24:25,901 --> 01:24:28,587
[Team Ha Ha and Infinite also
passes the first course.]

1206
01:24:30,490 --> 01:24:31,884
How in the world does this work?

1207
01:24:33,965 --> 01:24:35,199
Let's stay focused.
Team Sistar isn't even through yet.

1208
01:24:40,629 --> 01:24:43,817
[Is it because of his muscly arms?
Team Sistar struggling at the end.]

1209
01:24:44,290 --> 01:24:46,655
[Finally able to escape!]

1210
01:24:48,874 --> 01:24:51,483
[Oh... Team 2PM also escapes!]

1211
01:24:53,500 --> 01:24:55,943
[Team A-Pink are also on their way!]

1212
01:25:02,560 --> 01:25:04,972
[Only Jae Suk's Day is still
behind his cage.]

1213
01:25:04,973 --> 01:25:06,786
What is this?
I'm the only one still stuck back here?

1214
01:25:12,747 --> 01:25:16,693
[Even though it's only seven pieces,
the puzzle is harder than expected.]

1215
01:25:19,491 --> 01:25:21,612
Over here.
What are you doing, Joon?

1216
01:25:34,714 --> 01:25:38,752
[If they just placed it where they were,
then they could've completed it.]

1217
01:25:41,768 --> 01:25:43,045
This doesn't fit.

1218
01:25:44,009 --> 01:25:47,080
[The more people doing the puzzle,
the more confusing it becomes.]

1219
01:25:51,968 --> 01:25:53,612
- This is hard.
- Hang on a second.

1220
01:25:53,959 --> 01:25:57,485
[This is the correct solution.]

1221
01:26:02,785 --> 01:26:04,850
[Oh yeah, this guy!]

1222
01:26:04,851 --> 01:26:07,286
[Still struggling with all the knots.]

1223
01:26:09,968 --> 01:26:12,132
What one of these pieces
are shaped like this?

1224
01:26:16,912 --> 01:26:20,523
[Try it fitting it this way,
and try fitting it that way.]

1225
01:26:24,606 --> 01:26:26,355
This is really hard.

1226
01:26:26,356 --> 01:26:28,375
[But Team Suk Jin and 2PM has
quite a bit of the puzzle completed.]

1227
01:26:34,573 --> 01:26:36,907
Hang on a second.
Hand me this piece.

1228
01:26:40,240 --> 01:26:42,524
[Has Team Ji Hyo and Beast
figured it out?]

1229
01:26:42,525 --> 01:26:43,748
We got it!

1230
01:26:43,749 --> 01:26:45,755
[The 'R' is complete!]

1231
01:26:47,412 --> 01:26:48,624
- It's right there.
- Here.

1232
01:26:50,031 --> 01:26:52,319
[Wow... Team 2PM also completes it!]

1233
01:26:52,963 --> 01:26:55,136
[Gains their keys!]

1234
01:26:57,055 --> 01:26:59,827
[Heading off to the final stage!]

1235
01:27:01,267 --> 01:27:04,911
[Team Beast vs. Team 2PM...
Just who will be in first?]

1236
01:27:11,531 --> 01:27:12,947
Go!

1237
01:27:14,914 --> 01:27:16,986
[Sticking the key into the camera?]

1238
01:27:18,928 --> 01:27:20,967
[Open!]

1239
01:27:23,851 --> 01:27:25,615
[Wait a second...]

1240
01:27:29,243 --> 01:27:30,879
[Darn!]

1241
01:27:30,880 --> 01:27:32,320
We won!

1242
01:27:32,321 --> 01:27:35,727
[Team Ji Hyo and Beast succeeds
in winning the flag!]

1243
01:27:40,059 --> 01:27:42,113
[But Team 2PM with the least amount of
allotted time comes in at second place.]

1244
01:27:42,114 --> 01:27:44,197
We're the King of Idols!

1245
01:27:45,023 --> 01:27:48,546
[Team Ji Hyo and Beast wins!]

1246
01:27:48,547 --> 01:27:52,045
- Everyday...
- Is Jae Suk's Day!

1247
01:27:52,046 --> 01:27:53,956
Every day's Girl's Day!

1248
01:27:56,773 --> 01:28:00,923
The final victor of today's race is,
Team Beast!

1249
01:28:00,924 --> 01:28:05,466
[Today's victors-
Team Ji Hyo and Beast.]

1250
01:28:05,467 --> 01:28:06,766
Beast!

1251
01:28:11,421 --> 01:28:13,494
Please come up and get your prize.

1252
01:28:13,495 --> 01:28:15,225
[Time to give out the prize.]

1253
01:28:15,226 --> 01:28:18,216
We came in at second place with only
110 seconds. We did pretty great.

1254
01:28:18,217 --> 01:28:19,809
We would've won if we had
a little bit more time.

1255
01:28:21,761 --> 01:28:23,693
First place.

1256
01:28:23,718 --> 01:28:25,561
Is this real gold?

1257
01:28:28,776 --> 01:28:31,383
Blank Ji and Beast!

1258
01:28:31,384 --> 01:28:35,009
[Blank Ji Hyo and Beast wins!]

1259
