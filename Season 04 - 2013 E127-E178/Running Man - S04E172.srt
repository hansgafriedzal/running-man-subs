changes from attack to defense.]

[With nowhere to run to,
Jae Suk desperately starts his attack.]

quietly sneaks in somewhere...]

00:02:01,935 --> 00:02:04,297
We don't have much time.
They're all on the first floor right now.

28
00:02:04,298 --> 00:02:06,411
We have to get as many
as we can during this round.

29
00:02:07,603 --> 00:02:09,795
I know that there's no one in there,
so don't go in there.

30
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:11,474
- There's no one in there?

[Nervous and itchy mannequin.]

32
00:02:14,708 --> 00:02:16,663
I think I'm going to go check
my previous hiding spot.

33
00:02:17,269 --> 00:02:18,992
I doubt anyone would be hiding
in here, right?

34
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,840
There's no way someone could
be hiding here.

35
00:02:23,508 --> 00:02:26,171
[Yes, someone could be hiding there...]

36

finding our hiding spots.

[Even though Jae Suk's flattered
that he's a fan...]

87
00:05:40,973 --> 00:05:44,969
[A win is a win.]

a fan of Jae Suk's for a very long time.]

[Under the attack of experienced RM members,
four EXO members are ousted instantly.]

112
00:07:16,809 --> 00:07:19,944
Ji Hyo and Jae Suk are still left.

113
00:07:19,945 --> 00:07:22,397
If I'm to survive to take them out,
I think I need to hide for right now.

114
00:07:27,067 --> 00:07:31,152
[Too unsure to hide here...
too nervous to hide there.]

115
00:07:35,453 --> 00:07:38,253
[His hesitation leads him to
getting caught by Blank Ji.]

116
00:07:38,254 --> 00:07:40,019

[Jae Suk trying to take him on
with the use of his strength.]

122
00:07:53,463 --> 00:07:54,955
I ousted Jong Kook with my own hands.

123
00:07:56,175 --> 00:07:58,442
- Do you remember?
- Of course, I remember.

124
00:07:58,443 --> 00:08:01,003

I have no other choice.

128
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:15,569
There's no need to feel sorry for this.

129
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:16,818
- Kai.
- Yes?

130
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:19,412
[I have to do whatever I can
to escape out of here.]

131
00:08:23,155 --> 00:08:25,504
[Caught!]

132
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:26,929

given to them by Ryu Hyun Jin!]

138
00:08:47,108 --> 00:08:49,732
How many balls have you collected
throughout the day today?

139
00:08:49,733 --> 00:08:50,847
- Two.
- Two.

140
00:08:50,848 --> 00:08:52,798
Show by a raise of your hand
who has the balls right now.

141
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:54,727
[Ha Ha and Ji Hyo each have a ball?]

142
00:08:54,728 --> 00:08:56,450
It's actually in my pocket.

143
00:08:57,734 --> 00:08:58,994
[Suk Jin's original ball...]

144
00:08:58,995 --> 00:09:00,194
[First stolen by Ha Ha in the restaurant...]

145
00:09:00,195 --> 00:09:03,068
[Then stolen by Jong Kook.]

146
00:09:03,069 --> 00:09:04,882
- You gave it to me earlier.
- You said you just wanted to see it.

147
00:09:04,883 --> 00:09:07,314
But I held onto it this whole time,
and it's in my possession.

148
00:09:07,315 --> 00:09:09,374
Isn't that stealing?

149
00:09:09,718 --> 00:09:11,588
This place is like a cave full of thieves!

150
00:09:13,311 --> 00:09:16,411
[Just what are these balls to be used for?]

151
00:09:16,412 --> 00:09:18,452
Since you won the final mission,
you will be given two additional balls.

152
00:09:18,453 --> 00:09:22,912
[From having won the hide-and-go-seek mission,
they are given two additional signed balls.]

153
00:09:22,913 --> 00:09:24,102
- Can you give me one, Ji Hyo?
- Ji Hyo has two! Can I have one?

154
00:09:24,103 --> 00:09:25,513
Give me one, Ji Hyo.

155
00:09:25,514 --> 00:09:29,169
Since I have two balls,
do I have to give one to someone else?

156
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:30,899
I've been so happy to have spent
the day with Ji Hyo today.

157
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:33,413
Since Ha Ha had his ball earlier today,
I'm going to give one to Kang Gary.

158
00:09:33,414 --> 00:09:37,096
[That's our Monday Couple!
Ji Hyo gives her extra ball to Gary.]

159
00:09:37,595 --> 00:09:40,497
Tra-it-ors, Cross!

160
00:09:41,374 --> 00:09:44,416
[And the Traitors Club
is back together again.]

161
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:46,787
The three of you have no options
since you don't have a ball.

162
00:09:46,788 --> 00:09:49,828
As for the other four members with a ball,
please look behind you.

163
00:09:49,829 --> 00:09:52,297
- You will see doors marked with 'A' and 'B'.
- Yes.

164
00:09:52,298 --> 00:09:58,994
One by one, choose which door you'd like,
and you may step through the doorway.

165
00:09:59,029 --> 00:10:01,470
- Who'd like to go first?
- I'll go first.

166
00:10:01,471 --> 00:10:03,564
[Gary volunteers to choose first.]

167
00:10:03,565 --> 00:10:05,116
- This is all about chance anyway, right?
- Of course.

168
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:10,359
[Just what is behind those two doors?]

169
00:10:10,802 --> 00:10:12,847
<i>If Gary goes through the 'A' door,
then should I go through the other door?</i>

170
00:10:13,719 --> 00:10:16,001
[Gary chooses door, 'B'.]

171
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:23,113
[Jae Suk chooses the 'A' door.]

172
00:10:25,069 --> 00:10:26,932
[Ji Hyo...]

173
00:10:26,933 --> 00:10:29,137
[Chooses door 'A' like Jae Suk.]

174
00:10:32,733 --> 00:10:36,180
[The last possession of the ball, Jong Kook,
also chooses the 'A' door.]

175
00:10:44,074 --> 00:10:47,455
[Seoul 'S' hotel.]

176
00:10:47,957 --> 00:10:51,856
- What is this?
- Why are we stuck here?

177
00:10:51,857 --> 00:10:53,714
- Move out of the way.
- Why are you doing this to us?

178
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:59,898
[Oh my goodness... so sorry.]

179
00:10:59,899 --> 00:11:01,999
- What are you trying to do to us?
- Is this a hidden camera or something?

180
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,391
- Are you okay?
- We could've gotten hurt.

181
00:11:04,392 --> 00:11:06,162
That was so careless of you guys.

182
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:09,874
<i>Since none of you possessed a ball,
you don't have any rights.</i>

183
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:13,492
<i>- You just need to stand by and watch.
- But we can still win.</i>

184
00:11:13,946 --> 00:11:17,520
<i>- Sure, go ahead and win.
- Trai-tors- Cross!</i>

185
00:11:17,521 --> 00:11:19,770
- We're seriously going to win.
- Door 'A', please come on out.

186
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:23,077
[Just then...]

187
00:11:26,709 --> 00:11:30,883
[Jae Suk, Jong Kook, and Ji Hyo walking out
of the 'A' door that they chose earlier.]

188
00:11:31,487 --> 00:11:33,604
I love doing things like that!

189
00:11:34,565 --> 00:11:37,056
Can we try doing it too?
We'd be really good at that.

190
00:11:37,057 --> 00:11:39,874
- Go ahead, then. Try it.
- Seriously... let us show you how it's done.

191
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:41,502
- We'll show you.
- I can't believe you guys can't do it.

192
00:11:42,632 --> 00:11:44,268
<i>One, two, three.</i>

193
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:46,336
<i>- What the heck?
- Why isn't the door opening?</i>

194
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:48,866
<i>[I'd like to see you try.]</i>

195
00:11:53,412 --> 00:11:55,460
I haven't even made my entrance yet!
Why are you opening my door!

196
00:11:55,461 --> 00:11:58,908
- Why are you opening Gary's door?
- It was because we couldn't open ours.

197
00:11:58,909 --> 00:12:00,764
I should've been able to make a
grand entrance like that.

198
00:12:01,851 --> 00:12:03,619
- Go back behind the 'B' door.
- I have to go back?

199
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:07,059
- What is going on here?
- Why did you have to ruin it for me?

200
00:12:07,555 --> 00:12:10,560
Why are you trying to
ruin everything, Kwang Soo?

201
00:12:10,561 --> 00:12:12,551
Can't you tell by seeing how the three
of you guys are grouped together?

202
00:12:12,552 --> 00:12:14,836
- Of course, we see! We're going to win.
- We know exactly what's going to happen.

203
00:12:14,837 --> 00:12:17,195
- You think you guys are the stars of this?
- Yes, we do!

204
00:12:17,196 --> 00:12:18,488
We're going to make sure to win.

205
00:12:18,489 --> 00:12:24,725
You guys are nothing but comic relief while
the A and B teams take a little break time.

206
00:12:25,467 --> 00:12:27,413
- You're like the seasoning on top.
- We're the seasoning?

207
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:30,441
- How can you say that we're seasoning?
- That really was uncalled for.

208
00:12:31,012 --> 00:12:34,571
<i>You three rightfully gained your own
signed ball, correct?</i>

209
00:12:34,572 --> 00:12:37,814
Rightfully? He practically stole it from me,
and he's saying that it's rightfully his?

210
00:12:37,815 --> 00:12:40,610
So this is what you call, 'rightfully'?

211
00:12:40,611 --> 00:12:43,380
- Seriously.
- You all passed through door 'A'.

212
00:12:43,381 --> 00:12:45,571
- Yes, we did.
- You all chose to go through door 'A'.

213
00:12:45,606 --> 00:12:48,241
I will now introduce you to someone
whom you need to meet.

214
00:12:48,242 --> 00:12:50,772
[One person who's waiting for these three
that walked through door 'A'.]

215
00:12:51,608 --> 00:12:56,726
[He's... finally here.]

216
00:12:56,727 --> 00:13:00,053
[The return of our hero!]

217
00:13:00,054 --> 00:13:03,889
[Korean Monster]

218
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:07,231
[Ryu Hyun Jin]

219
00:13:09,188 --> 00:13:14,510
[Monster pitcher who led his team to 14 wins
during his first year in the major leagues.]

220
00:13:14,545 --> 00:13:17,592
[The pride of Republic of Korea that's caught
the attention of everyone worldwide.]

221
00:13:17,593 --> 00:13:19,661
[The cutie pie with the bright smile whom the
RM cast met for the first time last year.]

222
00:13:19,661 --> 00:13:21,810
[He has now returned as a legend.]

223
00:13:21,811 --> 00:13:23,152
[Korean Monster]

224
00:13:23,788 --> 00:13:25,933
[Ryu Hyun Jin with Running Man.]

225
00:13:26,557 --> 00:13:30,641
[Welcome back, Ryu.]

226
00:13:35,588 --> 00:13:37,591
- Get out!
- Out of the way!

227
00:13:41,243 --> 00:13:42,893
Ryu Hyun Jin!

228
00:13:44,233 --> 00:13:47,063
[A forceful greeting of the superstar
by punching him in the mouth.]

229
00:13:47,064 --> 00:13:49,527
- What are you doing?
- How dare you lay your hand on Hyun Jin?

230
00:13:49,528 --> 00:13:51,866
Don't you know that he's a
world famous star?

231
00:13:51,867 --> 00:13:53,789
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing to a world famous star?

232
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:57,440
- Get away from him!
- C team must get back to your stand.

233
00:13:57,646 --> 00:13:59,379
<i>Ryu Hyun Jin!</i>

234
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:02,810
[And... one man who is still
unable to see him.]

235
00:14:02,991 --> 00:14:05,210
- Ryu Hyun Jin!
- You should be thankful to us.

236
00:14:05,211 --> 00:14:07,448
Gary's starting to get depressed
back there.

237
00:14:07,449 --> 00:14:11,210
How about a round of applause
for Ryu Hyun Jin?

238
00:14:11,549 --> 00:14:13,724
Can you say a greeting
to our viewers?

239
00:14:13,725 --> 00:14:15,904
Hello, my name is Ryu Hyun Jin.

240
00:14:16,644 --> 00:14:18,388
Are you seriously just
going to say 'hi'?

241
00:14:18,388 --> 00:14:21,413
It's been a year since I was
last on the show.

242
00:14:21,414 --> 00:14:23,939
- Well, and I...
- Why don't you say it in English?

243
00:14:24,661 --> 00:14:27,810
Very, very happy.

244
00:14:27,811 --> 00:14:31,369
[His sense of humor is still the same.]

245
00:14:32,225 --> 00:14:34,078
Keep it down!
You keep it down back there!

246
00:14:34,742 --> 00:14:39,934
<i>You will be on the same team as Korea's Ace
Ryu Hyun Jin for choosing the door 'A'.</i>

247
00:14:39,935 --> 00:14:42,524
- Seriously?
- He's going to be on our team?

248
00:14:42,905 --> 00:14:46,386
<i>But as you can see from the number
of members in the Traitors Club...</i>

249
00:14:46,387 --> 00:14:47,905
<i>there are only three members to a team.</i>

250
00:14:47,906 --> 00:14:52,471
<i>So out of the three members that
walked through the door</i>

251
00:14:52,695 --> 00:14:55,959
<i>Ryu Hyun Jin has to choose the two members
that he'd liked to be teamed up with.</i>

252
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:58,553
- You have to be good to me.
- You'd better just come here, Jong Kook.

253
00:14:58,554 --> 00:15:00,728
So he can just ditch one of the members.

254
00:15:00,729 --> 00:15:03,881
- First, you need to put your arms down.
- Why does he have to do that?

255
00:15:05,073 --> 00:15:07,470
- I don't feel as bad anymore!
- He has to pick two of us?

256
00:15:07,471 --> 00:15:13,344
Ryu Hyun Jin must first pick one member
that he wants to be teamed up with.

257
00:15:13,618 --> 00:15:17,375
Choose your first team member by giving
that person a gentle hug from the back.

258
00:15:17,376 --> 00:15:19,293
- Look at how confident Jae Suk looks.
- Pick only one person for now.

259
00:15:20,339 --> 00:15:23,169
[Trepidation]

260
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:24,477
- Pick your first member.
- Please, Hyun Jin.

261
00:15:25,262 --> 00:15:29,131
[Just who will Hyun Jin choose?]

262
00:15:33,608 --> 00:15:35,061
Oh, it's Ji Hyo!

263
00:15:35,783 --> 00:15:37,985
[After teasing Jae Suk first...]

264
00:15:37,986 --> 00:15:40,746
[He selects Blank Ji!]

265
00:15:45,015 --> 00:15:47,312
- What are you doing!
- There it is!

266
00:15:47,336 --> 00:15:49,682
[This is fun!]

267
00:15:49,683 --> 00:15:52,497
- You're doing great, Ryu Hyun Jin!
- What did you just say to me?

268
00:15:52,498 --> 00:15:54,592
- What are you doing?
- Okay, Song Ji Hyo.

269
00:15:54,593 --> 00:15:58,946
Song Ji Hyo can now go stand
right next to Ryu Hyun Jin.

270
00:15:58,947 --> 00:16:00,318
[One more person left to choose.]

271
00:16:00,319 --> 00:16:04,663
Okay, now your other team member.
One, two, three!

272
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:08,472
One, two, three!

273
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:12,178
[Wow! He chooses Kkuk!]

274
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:13,998
Don't you think that you're
being too harsh?

275
00:16:14,767 --> 00:16:18,045
- Wow! This is awesome!
- You really are being too harsh!

276
00:16:18,379 --> 00:16:21,569
- Seriously? Me?
- Do you know how much I cheered you on?

277
00:16:22,129 --> 00:16:23,592
Go away!

278
00:16:24,135 --> 00:16:27,461
Wow, Ryu Hyun Jin!
I've been waiting for a whole year for this!

279
00:16:27,462 --> 00:16:29,003
[Thus, Hyun Jin, Jong Kook,
and Ji Hyo make up a team.]

280
00:16:29,004 --> 00:16:31,792
<i>Okay, it's time for the 'B' team.
Please come out through the door.</i>

281
00:16:31,793 --> 00:16:34,398
- Gary, come on out!
- I wonder who'll come through the door!

282
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:35,553
<i>Come out?</i>

283
00:16:35,949 --> 00:16:39,433
[First official entrance after whole
20 minutes after the filming started.]

284
00:16:39,434 --> 00:16:41,682
- Hey, Brother!
- What's up?

285
00:16:42,598 --> 00:16:45,285
Yeah, I'm right here.
I'm right here.

286
00:16:45,286 --> 00:16:46,943
Your English has gotten much better.

287
00:16:47,319 --> 00:16:50,565
<i>It's now time for Team B to meet
their other team member.</i>

288
00:16:51,044 --> 00:16:56,795
[Just who's waiting to become the final
team member with Gary and Jae Suk?]

289
00:16:59,476 --> 00:17:05,741
[She... has returned.]

290
00:17:05,742 --> 00:17:09,650
[The never changing nation's first love.]

291
00:17:09,651 --> 00:17:15,317
[Miss A's Suzy.]

292
00:17:15,318 --> 00:17:17,492
- She's gotten even prettier.
- Suzy! Suzy!

293
00:17:17,493 --> 00:17:20,546
- Bae Suzy! Bae Suzy!
- Suzy!

294
00:17:20,547 --> 00:17:22,534
Don't touch her!
Don't touch her!

295
00:17:22,535 --> 00:17:25,267
Don't touch her.
Don't touch her!

296
00:17:25,561 --> 00:17:29,207
[Suzy's innocent beauty that they can
never seem to get used to.]

297
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,311
Hyun Jin.

298
00:17:31,312 --> 00:17:34,764
- Hello.
- Hello.

299
00:17:36,033 --> 00:17:38,718
Hyun Jin really likes Suzy.
He's a huge fan of hers.

300
00:17:38,719 --> 00:17:41,006
[Hyun Jin is a fan of Suzy's.]

301
00:17:41,007 --> 00:17:42,696
Didn't you say that she's
your ideal type?

302
00:17:43,772 --> 00:17:46,738
He likes her!
He likes her!

303
00:17:50,083 --> 00:17:53,160
[A huge smile that he can't
manage to hide.]

304
00:17:53,161 --> 00:17:55,368
[Getting his expression back under control.]

305
00:17:55,369 --> 00:17:57,749
- What are you doing?
- Don't try to act all cool.

306
00:17:58,223 --> 00:18:00,143
- Don't do that.
- That's so not like you.

307
00:18:00,144 --> 00:18:04,547
[He doesn't have a serious expression on his
face even when he's on the baseball mound.]

308
00:18:04,548 --> 00:18:06,478
[A handshake between the two?]

309
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:13,243
[Why are you doing that to me?]

310
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:17,192
- Try it again.
- It's nice to meet you.

311
00:18:17,193 --> 00:18:23,762
<i>He likes her!
He likes her!</i>

312
00:18:25,482 --> 00:18:28,098
- Suzy's here.
- It's really hot out here.

313
00:18:28,099 --> 00:18:31,234
[This is a side of Ryu Hyun Jin
we've never seen before.]

314
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:33,541
<i>As you may already know, Ryu Hyun Jin
brought you all a gift from LA.</i>

315
00:18:33,542 --> 00:18:35,459
[A gift that Hyun Jin brought back
all the way from LA.]

316
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:38,167
[LA Dodgers player hats.]

317
00:18:38,491 --> 00:18:41,315
- These? They're authentic.
- Authentic players hats?

318
00:18:41,316 --> 00:18:42,544
- Really?
- Wow.

319
00:18:42,545 --> 00:18:44,552
You get the biggest one since you look
like you have the biggest head.

320
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:48,325
- They're all different?
- There are different sizes.

321
00:18:48,326 --> 00:18:51,340
[Touched by his thoughtful gift
that he brought back for them.]

322
00:18:51,341 --> 00:18:52,403
This is a little big.

323
00:18:52,404 --> 00:18:54,595
And I have a game day hat for Suzy.

324
00:18:55,062 --> 00:18:57,741
[And even more of a thoughtful gift
just for her.]

325
00:18:57,742 --> 00:18:59,858
Don't you think that you're being
too obvious with your favorites?

326
00:18:59,859 --> 00:19:01,824
- Wow, this is nice.
- This is so nice.

327
00:19:01,825 --> 00:19:04,690
- You must be so happy, Suzy.
- You got the best one.

328
00:19:04,691 --> 00:19:06,222
- Thank you.
- It matches your outfit too.

329
00:19:06,223 --> 00:19:09,639
It matches your outfit perfectly.
I tried to wear something that would match.

330
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:12,564
- What is that?
- I brought a marker.

331
00:19:12,565 --> 00:19:14,279
- Sign!
- Can you sign this?

332
00:19:15,483 --> 00:19:18,519
[Everyone crowding around Hyun Jin to
get his autograph on their hats.]

333
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:21,126
- I want to get his signature too.
- Sign this.

334
00:19:21,845 --> 00:19:23,747
- Is this Kwang Soo's?
- I already have one at home.

335
00:19:23,748 --> 00:19:25,299
Why are you signing it!

336
00:19:26,065 --> 00:19:27,941
- Why would you sign it!
- You don't want me to sign it?

337
00:19:27,942 --> 00:19:29,732
- I thought you wanted me to sign it.
- You really are so weird.

338
00:19:29,733 --> 00:19:31,587
- What is your name?
- Why would you do that?

339
00:19:31,588 --> 00:19:33,079
- It's Kwang Soo.
- Why are you even answering that?

340
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,931
[And he actually answers the question...]

341
00:19:38,066 --> 00:19:39,268
- Here you go.
- Give it back.

342
00:19:39,269 --> 00:19:41,143
What the heck!
He really did sign it!

343
00:19:44,284 --> 00:19:46,920
<i>Okay, today's race is...</i>

344
00:19:47,367 --> 00:19:50,562
<i>It's Running Man's Late Fall MT Race.</i>

345
00:19:50,563 --> 00:19:52,259
<i>We're going on an MT!
(MT=Overnight field trip.)</i>

346
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:56,429
<i>Ryu Hyun Jin, who's come back to visit us
on Running Man after being overseas...</i>

347
00:19:56,652 --> 00:20:00,554
<i>and Suzy, who could almost be the eighth
member of our show, Running Man...</i>

348
00:20:00,555 --> 00:20:03,437
<i>You will all be playing several different
MT games throughout the day today.</i>

349
00:20:03,438 --> 00:20:06,959
<i>And through the succession of each
of these games...</i>

350
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,600
<i>you will be earning yourselves
the money you need for the MT.</i>

351
00:20:08,601 --> 00:20:10,156
[Fees for the MT will be handed out in cash
depending on the number of survivors.]

352
00:20:10,157 --> 00:20:15,502
<i>More money you earn throughout the day,
more advantageous it will be for you.</i>

353
00:20:15,916 --> 00:20:19,938
<i>I hope that you all work hard to do your best,
and make some good memories in the process.</i>

354
00:20:20,123 --> 00:20:22,691
<i>Please change into your team uniforms,
and gather in front of your team vehicles.</i>

355
00:20:22,692 --> 00:20:24,051
- Go!
- Go!

356
00:20:24,052 --> 00:20:29,386
[Time to build some memories-
Off on their Running Man MT trip!]

357
00:20:34,305 --> 00:20:37,389
- That happened so long ago.
- I'm not like that anymore.

358
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:39,697
- You three together is bad news.
- Which car are we supposed to take?

359
00:20:39,698 --> 00:20:41,291
[Huh? Only two cars?]

360
00:20:42,246 --> 00:20:45,460
[Team Hyun Jin and Team Suzy
are to share one car.]

361
00:20:45,943 --> 00:20:48,745
- Let us come with you, Suzy!
- Close the door on them, Suzy.

362
00:20:48,746 --> 00:20:50,269
[And Team Traitors Club who must go
on their lonely way by themselves.]

363
00:20:54,391 --> 00:20:55,709
I locked the door.

364
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:57,142
[Let us come with you!]

365
00:20:57,684 --> 00:20:59,286
What's going on in here?

366
00:20:59,287 --> 00:21:01,291
You guys are all coupled off.

367
00:21:01,292 --> 00:21:03,808
[Now that they take a look,
they're all coupled off in the back.]

368
00:21:03,809 --> 00:21:07,060
Then what does that make Jong Kook and I?
The chaperons?

369
00:21:07,061 --> 00:21:09,983
- Wow, seriously.
- I like where I'm sitting.

370
00:21:09,984 --> 00:21:12,692
Hey, Hyun Jin.
This really does feel like an MT trip.

371
00:21:12,693 --> 00:21:14,333
[Exciting start to their MT trip.]

372
00:21:14,783 --> 00:21:17,611
- I've never been on an MT before.
- Seriously?

373
00:21:17,612 --> 00:21:21,551
[Today is Suzy's first MT trip!]

374
00:21:21,825 --> 00:21:24,814
- What do you do on an MT?
- You drink.

375
00:21:24,815 --> 00:21:26,989
You drink and play some games.

376
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:31,174
- That's right, there are some games too.
- And there's some flirting too.

377
00:21:32,478 --> 00:21:35,074
You've seen some of Hyun Jin's game too,
haven't you, Suzy?

378
00:21:35,075 --> 00:21:36,453
- Me?
- Yeah, you.

379
00:21:36,454 --> 00:21:38,018
Be honest, Suzy.

380
00:21:39,201 --> 00:21:41,214
- Be honest with us.
- You haven't seen any, have you?

381
00:21:41,712 --> 00:21:43,984
- I haven't seen too many.
- Do you even know who he is?

382
00:21:45,785 --> 00:21:47,628
- You at least know who he is, right?
- Of course, I know him.

383
00:21:47,629 --> 00:21:50,389
- Isn't he kind of chubby and cute?
- Well, yes.

384
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:54,526
But I wouldn't call him chubby.
Rather than calling him chubby...

385
00:21:54,527 --> 00:21:57,542
- Am I fat? Just fat?
- I'd say that he's like a giant...

386
00:21:57,543 --> 00:21:59,335
No, you're not fat either.

387
00:21:59,336 --> 00:22:01,179
I don't think Hyun Jin should
be sitting there right now.

388
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:04,167
- Why?
- He's not really talking with Suzy there.

389
00:22:04,168 --> 00:22:07,031
What is it about Suzy that you
like so much?

390
00:22:07,032 --> 00:22:09,254
- Excuse me?
- What is it about her that you like?

391
00:22:09,441 --> 00:22:11,165
Is it because she's pretty?

392
00:22:12,138 --> 00:22:14,889
- Oh... that must be the reason.
- That's what I thought.

393
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:18,757
- Come on and tell us.
- Why aren't you saying anything?

394
00:22:18,758 --> 00:22:21,390
There's no reason to be embarrassed.
Do you know why?

395
00:22:21,391 --> 00:22:25,426
If you think about it, pretty much
all the men out there like her.

396
00:22:25,427 --> 00:22:27,284
But seriously, Suzy...

397
00:22:27,394 --> 00:22:30,722
He's really a great guy.
Hyun Jin really is a great guy.

398
00:22:30,723 --> 00:22:34,598
- He's one of the best guys I know.
- He really is a great guy.

399
00:22:34,599 --> 00:22:36,105
I feel like I'm out on a blind date.

400
00:22:36,106 --> 00:22:37,810
- You didn't know?
- You didn't know?

401
00:22:37,811 --> 00:22:40,172
- This is a blind date.
- You seriously didn't know?

402
00:22:40,173 --> 00:22:42,864
- You weren't aware?
- We set you two up on a blind date.

403
00:22:43,693 --> 00:22:45,713
- You didn't know?
- You really didn't know?

404
00:22:45,714 --> 00:22:48,198
- You knew about it, right, Hyun Jin?
- Yes.

405
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:49,606
Yes.

406
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,484
[That's the Ryu sense of humor.]

407
00:22:53,848 --> 00:22:56,523
So Suzy was the only one who didn't know?
Who cares if you didn't know?

408
00:22:56,524 --> 00:22:58,588
- It's okay.
- I'll just have to get to know him then.

409
00:22:58,822 --> 00:23:01,318
[Even she herself is surprised at
what she just said.]

410
00:23:01,319 --> 00:23:02,874
What is it that you want to know?
What is it?

411
00:23:03,325 --> 00:23:05,556
- I'm curious to know too.
- Where's the other car?

412
00:23:06,276 --> 00:23:07,428
Team C.

413
00:23:07,429 --> 00:23:09,258
Ah, Team C?
Who cares where that car is.

414
00:23:09,259 --> 00:23:12,034
[That's right...
we forgot about Team C...]

415
00:23:13,534 --> 00:23:15,698
[Were you talking about us?]

416
00:23:15,699 --> 00:23:19,773
[These guys are slowly...]

417
00:23:19,774 --> 00:23:22,032
[Ugh...]

418
00:23:22,033 --> 00:23:23,759
There's something I'm curious
about, Hyun Jin.

419
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,624
People are always coming up to you
to say something when you're on the mound.

420
00:23:26,625 --> 00:23:29,825
- What are they saying to you?
- Especially that player, Uribe?

421
00:23:29,826 --> 00:23:34,533
Just that with all the bases loaded,
in case I'm getting tired out...

422
00:23:35,618 --> 00:23:39,505
[Ah... they purposely come to talk to the
pitcher to buy him some time to rest.]

423
00:23:39,506 --> 00:23:42,852
So when I just keep saying yes,
Uribe tells me to say his name.

424
00:23:42,853 --> 00:23:45,677
So when I say his name, Uribe,
he just starts to nod his head.

425
00:23:45,678 --> 00:23:47,041
That's what you guys do?

426
00:23:47,495 --> 00:23:49,317
So that's what you guys are doing?

427
00:23:49,517 --> 00:23:52,009
<i>- Yes, yes.
- What is my name?</i>

428
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:53,254
<i>Uribe!</i>

429
00:23:55,146 --> 00:23:57,125
The thing is that all Koreans tend to have
a certain preconceived notion about Hyun Jin.

430
00:23:57,126 --> 00:24:01,015
They all think that Hyun Jin never gets
fazed by anything or anyone.

431
00:24:01,254 --> 00:24:04,981
- But to be honest, you get nervous, right?
- Of course! I bet it's no joke out there.

432
00:24:05,016 --> 00:24:09,395
What comes to my mind is the third game
in the playoff series.

433
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:13,340
[Ryu Hyun Jin's first foray into the
National Major Leagues Playoff Games.]

434
00:24:13,341 --> 00:24:14,690
How did you honestly feel then?

435
00:24:14,691 --> 00:24:18,932
- At that moment... I really was very nervous.
- Yeah, I bet.

436
00:24:18,933 --> 00:24:23,623
And I think that's the hardest I ever threw
in all the games I've played in my life.

437
00:24:27,384 --> 00:24:29,781
[Seventh inning with all the
bases loaded...]

438
00:24:29,782 --> 00:24:33,352
[He strikes out his opposing team.]

439
00:24:33,387 --> 00:24:37,939
[Aggressive pitch that won the love
and fervor of all the fans in the crowd.]

440
00:24:40,586 --> 00:24:44,792
Didn't you pitch 95-96 miles per hour?
That's what I heard you pitched.

441
00:24:44,827 --> 00:24:47,767
I've never thrown a ball that clocked
that kind of speed in my life before.

442
00:24:47,768 --> 00:24:50,553
[Ryu Hyun Jin having thrown the ball
with every fiber of his being.]

443
00:24:51,617 --> 00:24:53,965
But it was actually pretty disappointing
from our standpoint.

444
00:24:53,966 --> 00:24:58,322
If the Dodgers had made it to Game Seven,
you would've been standing on that mound.

445
00:24:58,886 --> 00:25:01,601
If that's the case, then I really might die.

446
00:25:02,607 --> 00:25:07,239
Remember all the ragging that Hyun Jin
used to receive earlier on during the season?

447
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:10,688
- Yes, I used to get ragged on all the time.
- I bet that must've been shocking to you.

448
00:25:10,689 --> 00:25:12,813
But I didn't know that it was for me.

449
00:25:15,302 --> 00:25:18,519
- I didn't know they were ragging me on.
- That's too funny.

450
00:25:19,618 --> 00:25:23,148
- They love you when you play well, right?
- When I do, then they go ecstatic.

451
00:25:23,149 --> 00:25:25,686
- I have seen the crowd going ecstatic.
- I've seen the crowd going wild for you.

452
00:25:26,004 --> 00:25:28,559
But seriously though...
I know that Gary's mentioned it too

453
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,421
but you really are good at batting too.

454
00:25:30,484 --> 00:25:33,175
You've already seen my batting skills
when we played psychic baseball last year.

455
00:25:33,911 --> 00:25:36,605
So you're telling us that psychic baseball
was a huge help to you, right?

456
00:25:38,430 --> 00:25:40,878
- Then we've pretty much raised you.
- That's not a joke, Gary.

457
00:25:40,879 --> 00:25:42,182
We really did something great here.

458
00:25:42,183 --> 00:25:46,578
Running Man's psychic baseball really
helped Hyun Jin with his batting skills.

459
00:25:47,152 --> 00:25:49,934
- I even hit a homerun.
- That's right, I remember.

460
00:25:49,935 --> 00:25:51,118
[His skills allow him to even hit a homerun.]

461
00:25:51,119 --> 00:25:52,889
Even though I'm sure...

462
00:25:53,207 --> 00:25:55,185
that you don't remember
every single game...

463
00:25:55,186 --> 00:25:57,314
I bet you remember the
National Leagues Championship.

464
00:25:57,617 --> 00:25:59,643
- You know the game I'm talking about?
- Game three?

465
00:25:59,644 --> 00:26:02,760
That game and the first time
I got the shut out in the game.

466
00:26:02,761 --> 00:26:05,422
- That's right, the shut out!
- That was so awesome.

467
00:26:06,631 --> 00:26:09,408
[May, 29, 2013-
A game against Los Angeles Angels.]

468
00:26:12,542 --> 00:26:18,951
[His first shutout in the major leagues
during the ninth inning.]

469
00:26:21,579 --> 00:26:24,442
[Shut out?]

470
00:26:24,936 --> 00:26:27,664
You don't know what 'Shut out' is, do you?
I don't think Suzy knows what it is.

471
00:26:27,665 --> 00:26:30,628
- What is it? I can learn as I go.
- That's right.

472
00:26:30,629 --> 00:26:32,942
- Explain to her what it is.
- Shut out is...

473
00:26:32,943 --> 00:26:34,605
[Hyun Jin to explain it to her
directly himself.]

474
00:26:34,606 --> 00:26:38,182
We'll lay down some background music
for you while you and Suzy talk.

475
00:26:40,442 --> 00:26:43,008
- 'Introduction to Baseball.'
- That's perfect.

476
00:26:43,983 --> 00:26:47,141
[Suzy's introduction to baseball.]

477
00:26:47,142 --> 00:26:51,305
It's when one pitcher pitches the whole game
from first through the ninth inning.

478
00:26:51,306 --> 00:26:54,305
And the opposing team doesn't
score a single point the whole game.

479
00:26:54,306 --> 00:26:56,711
The opposing team scores nothing.
They don't score anything.

480
00:26:56,712 --> 00:26:59,303
It's basically when the other team
is shut out from scoring anything.

481
00:26:59,304 --> 00:27:01,536
- That's right.
- The other team is made a fool.

482
00:27:01,537 --> 00:27:03,952
- I don't know too much about baseball.
- Yes, the terminology may be confusing.

483
00:27:03,953 --> 00:27:07,550
The pitcher is always the star
of any baseball game.

484
00:27:07,551 --> 00:27:09,470
You don't really know much about
baseball either, Jong Kook.

485
00:27:09,471 --> 00:27:10,948
- Hey.
- He doesn't know much either.

486
00:27:11,256 --> 00:27:13,624
What are you talking about?
I love baseball.

487
00:27:13,625 --> 00:27:16,094
Are you taking Suzy's side right now?

488
00:27:19,246 --> 00:27:21,246
What is going on here!

489
00:27:22,806 --> 00:27:27,885
[Introduction to baseball only getting
deeper and deeper in next week's episode.]

490

[Meeting him is opening up her eyes
to the world of baseball?]

492
00:27:44,863 --> 00:27:46,944
[When are we ever going to get there?]

493
00:27:54,094 --> 00:27:55,952
How was the car ride?

494
00:27:55,953 --> 00:27:58,601
- It was the best.
- The car ride was great.

495
00:27:58,602 --> 00:28:00,767
- The car ride was so much fun.
- Wasn't it a lot of fun?

496
00:28:00,768 --> 00:28:04,073
- It was so much fun, I can't even tell you.
- You should've seen how much we had too.

497
00:28:04,074 --> 00:28:05,579
I don't think any of your car ride is
going to make it on the broadcast.

498
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:08,202
I think they're pretty much only going to
show our car ride on the broadcast.

499
00:28:08,203 --> 00:28:10,900
What is that?
I see a bunch of basins with water.

500
00:28:10,901 --> 00:28:14,122
[What are those water basins for?]

501
00:28:14,530 --> 00:28:17,112
- Why are you doing that?
- Why are you interrupting them like that?

502
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:21,473
[The Grasshopper keeps on getting in
between Suzy and Hyun Jin.]

503
00:28:21,474 --> 00:28:23,805
- Stop walking in between them!
- Why?

504
00:28:23,806 --> 00:28:26,537
It's because I'm close to both
Suzy and Hyun Jin!

505
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:28,929
Don't you have any common sense?

506
00:28:28,930 --> 00:28:30,704
What's with those two back there?

507
00:28:30,705 --> 00:28:33,336
- What are those two doing?
- What are they doing?

508
00:28:35,793 --> 00:28:38,689
It must be nice for them to film a show
and date at the same time like that.

509
00:28:38,690 --> 00:28:41,653
Did you hear what Suzy said about them?
About being able to film and date like that?

510
00:28:41,654 --> 00:28:42,834
[This is what Monday Couple is all about.]

511
00:28:43,192 --> 00:28:44,614
What is this?

512
00:28:45,605 --> 00:28:47,282
Wait, that's...

513
00:28:47,283 --> 00:28:49,574
- What is that?
- I'm not good at holding my breath.

514
00:28:49,575 --> 00:28:51,892
[Nine water basins out on the field?]

515
00:28:51,893 --> 00:28:54,649
<i>- Is everyone in a good mood?
- Yes.</i>

516
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:57,996
- What is all this?
- We were in a good mood until now.

517
00:28:57,997 --> 00:28:59,243
All my team members, come over here.

518
00:28:59,244 --> 00:29:03,024
<i>We're going to play a game that
everyone likes to play on an MT trip.</i>

519
00:29:03,347 --> 00:29:07,723
<i>If you do a good job on this game,
you can earn yourselves your MT fee.</i>

520
00:29:07,724 --> 00:29:09,415
- Really?
- Okay, let's do this.

521
00:29:09,416 --> 00:29:11,161
Even if we were to die today,
we're going to die winning this.

522
00:29:11,162 --> 00:29:14,015
[Making a vow of death?]

523
00:29:14,016 --> 00:29:16,493
[The Traitors Club putting their lives
on the line to win the game?]

524
00:29:16,494 --> 00:29:19,578
<i>The game you'll all be playing is called,
'Noonchi Game'.</i>

525
00:29:19,579 --> 00:29:20,925
What is that?

526
00:29:20,926 --> 00:29:23,397
- Is that where we count and watch each other?
- Gauging others' reactions?

527
00:29:23,398 --> 00:29:25,490
[That's right, that's the game.]

528
00:29:25,491 --> 00:29:28,685
<i>You all will dunk your faces
in the basin full of water.</i>

529
00:29:28,686 --> 00:29:31,106
No one plays this game while
submerged under water like that.

530
00:29:31,864 --> 00:29:33,405
[Kicking it up a notch
for the entertainment level.]

531
00:29:33,818 --> 00:29:36,308
I swear this to you all right now,
but I'm going to win this game.

532
00:29:36,309 --> 00:29:38,760
- I'm telling you right now that I'm going to.
- No, I'm going to win this game.

533
00:29:38,761 --> 00:29:40,763
- You go ahead and try it.
- You can't say 'One', can you?

534
00:29:40,764 --> 00:29:43,516
He just said that the best thing to do
is to last as long as you can underwater.

535
00:29:43,517 --> 00:29:44,744
[Not seeming to really understand the rules.]

536
00:29:44,745 --> 00:29:48,259
Suzy is going to explain the rules
of the game to Hyun Jin.

537
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:50,095
Go ahead and explain the
game rules for us.

538
00:29:50,096 --> 00:29:54,807
- So we have to time when we lift our heads.
- You're doing this on purpose, aren't you?

539
00:29:54,808 --> 00:29:58,555
[Giraffe not wanting to see things
blossom between Suzy and Hyun Jin.]

540
00:29:58,556 --> 00:29:59,945
Suzy's talking right now!

541
00:30:00,589 --> 00:30:03,306
[Giraffe not being able to pick up
what's going on between the two.]

542
00:30:03,307 --> 00:30:05,212
- What are you saying?
- Can't you tell what's going on?

543
00:30:05,213 --> 00:30:07,745
Don't you think that you're being
too harsh with your words right now?

544
00:30:07,746 --> 00:30:10,272
So the first thing you do
is to dunk your head underwater.

545
00:30:10,273 --> 00:30:13,461
- And once you do...
- Stare into his eyes while you talk to him.

546
00:30:14,025 --> 00:30:15,819
Stare into his eyes while
you talk to him.

547
00:30:16,132 --> 00:30:19,288
- Hyun Jin is looking at you right now.
- You're all embarrassing me.

548

[Learned how to make eye contact with
people during his stay in America.]

549
00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:24,794
So the thing is...

550
00:30:27,989 --> 00:30:31,238
[Wow... look at that guy!]

551
00:30:33,113 --> 00:30:34,719
- Hey, go away!
- Stay out of this!

552
00:30:35,899 --> 00:30:37,837
So what else?
We dunk our heads, and then what?

553
00:30:37,838 --> 00:30:40,913
We have to dunk our heads,
and gauge what others are doing.

554
00:30:41,739 --> 00:30:44,439
Then people start to lift their heads
one by one.

555
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:46,773
Two people can't lift up their heads
at the same time though.

556
00:30:47,939 --> 00:30:50,845
[Clueless Hyuk cutting in front
of the camera screen again.]

557
00:30:50,846 --> 00:30:54,887
So the team with a member who lasts
the longest underwater will win the game.

558
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:59,683
Suzy's not very good at
explaining things.

559
00:31:00,287 --> 00:31:02,141
I didn't really get
what she was saying either.

560
00:31:02,142 --> 00:31:04,537
<i>We'll start at the sound of my whistle.</i>

561
00:31:04,538 --> 00:31:07,497
I'll blow the whistle once
everyone has their faces underwater.

562
00:31:07,498 --> 00:31:09,365
Are we going on the count of one, or one?
[Huh?]

563
00:31:09,366 --> 00:31:11,504
- Either way.
- It's the same thing!

564
00:31:14,708 --> 00:31:16,754
One! One!
One, two, three!

565
00:31:17,219 --> 00:31:20,078
I just wanted to clarify how he was
going to say 'one'.

566
00:31:21,179 --> 00:31:23,134
There could be a lot of
confusion over that.

567
00:31:23,135 --> 00:31:25,090
Let's just go on one, okay?

568
00:31:25,091 --> 00:31:27,549
[Everyone preparing to submerge their heads
on the count of one.]

569
00:31:28,248 --> 00:31:30,048
<i>Ready.</i>

570
00:31:31,989 --> 00:31:34,633
<i>You have to have your faces submerged
before I blow my whistle.</i>

571
00:31:35,639 --> 00:31:37,456
<i>You have to put your face underwater.</i>

572
00:31:37,457 --> 00:31:40,418
- Your face has to be underwater.
- It is underwater!

573
00:31:41,963 --> 00:31:45,280
- It is underwater!
- Gary's face isn't underwater.

574
00:31:45,281 --> 00:31:48,444
- Just hurry up and blow!
- Gary's face isn't underwater.

575
00:31:48,917 --> 00:31:51,352
- Why aren't you doing it?
- Let's all play honestly.

576
00:31:51,353 --> 00:31:53,356
Let's all dunk our faces fairly.

577
00:31:54,967 --> 00:31:58,520
<i>I'll blow the whistle when you dunk your
faces and that's when the game will start.</i>

578

<i>Ready, set, go!</i>

579
00:32:00,538 --> 00:32:01,926
Ready, set, go!

580
00:32:06,015 --> 00:32:07,260
[Start!]

581
00:32:07,261 --> 00:32:08,382
One!

582
00:32:11,502 --> 00:32:14,663
[Big-nose and Ha Ha.]

583
00:32:14,664 --> 00:32:16,130
Someone's out, right?

584
00:32:17,167 --> 00:32:18,855
- Someone's out, right?
- Why?

585
00:32:18,856 --> 00:32:20,654
[Two members of Traitors Club ousted
in the first round of the game.]

586
00:32:20,655 --> 00:32:22,397
Ji Suk Jin and Ha Ha are out.

587
00:32:23,559 --> 00:32:25,644
- What are you talking about?
- How can we be out already?

588
00:32:29,273 --> 00:32:31,366
- Just give us one more chance!
- Please!

589
00:32:32,181 --> 00:32:34,169
[Begging desperately.]

590
00:32:35,363 --> 00:32:37,125
- Just give us one break.
- We can't be ousted already.

591
00:32:37,889 --> 00:32:40,290
Why do we even have this team
on the show today?

592
00:32:41,346 --> 00:32:44,128
[Traitors Team taking it upon themselves
to weed out all the bad seeds.]

593
00:32:44,129 --> 00:32:46,086
- Okay, if Ryu Hyun Jin will allow it.
- Hyun Jin!

594
00:32:46,087 --> 00:32:48,555
- Hyun Jin!
- Please let us off the hook just this once.

595
00:32:48,556 --> 00:32:50,388
No, you can't do that.
You're out.

596
00:32:50,389 --> 00:32:51,744
Rules are rules.

597
00:32:51,745 --> 00:32:54,800
We didn't even say a single word to
each other in the car either!

598
00:32:56,054 --> 00:32:58,153
Rules are meant to be broken!

599
00:32:59,354 --> 00:33:02,473
- We want to be on the show too!
- Please just give us a break!

600
00:33:02,888 --> 00:33:05,833
- Don't you even feel bad for us?
- Then beat Hyun Jin in rock-paper-scissors.

601
00:33:05,834 --> 00:33:08,127
- Okay, fine. I'll beat him.
- You just have to beat him.

602
00:33:08,128 --> 00:33:09,471
- Okay.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

603
00:33:09,472 --> 00:33:10,900
Rock-paper-scissors!

604

- Ha Ha too.

606

[Oh! Ha Ha wins!]

608
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:22,816
Thank you!

609
00:33:24,108 --> 00:33:26,316
Okay, disqualified players
must go off to the left.

610
00:33:26,317 --> 00:33:28,212
- I'm going to win, Suk Jin, so don't worry.
- Okay, win it!

611
00:33:29,142 --> 00:33:31,928
Okay, everyone dunk your faces in.

[Hyun Jin passes.]

615
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,090
- Two!
- Three!

616

[Oh no! Jae Suk and Gary
both shout out 'Three'!]

617

[Jae Suk and Gary ousted simultaneously.]

619
00:34:00,241 --> 00:34:01,962
The person who said it first
should be disqualified.

620
00:34:01,963 --> 00:34:05,103
- It should be the first person who said it.
- Suzy is left all on her own now.

621
00:34:05,104 --> 00:34:08,884
<i>No, both of you are disqualified. This is
a game that everyone knows how to play.</i>

622
00:34:08,885 --> 00:34:12,003
- But Ha Ha is still alive.
- Because he used the 'Hyun Jin' chance card.

623
00:34:12,004 --> 00:34:14,469
- Then let Gary live.
- I'm using the Song Ji Hyo chance card.

624
00:34:14,470 --> 00:34:16,739
Why are you saying my name
all of a sudden?

625
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:19,309
[At this rate, they're going to spout off
the names of everyone else that they know.]

626
00:34:19,310 --> 00:34:22,270
- Just let Gary live.
- No, that's not right.

627
00:34:22,271 --> 00:34:24,487
Then Ha Ha should be ousted too!

628
00:34:24,488 --> 00:34:27,610
- Rules are rules!
- No, I escaped being eliminated.

629

[Everyone out! Disgruntled Jae Suk wanting
to drag everyone down.]

630

Why are you trying to drag me down too?

- Everyone out!

- You have to do good, Suzy!
- Don't lift up your head, Kwang Soo.

- He says not to lift up his head.
- No, don't lift up your head.

637
00:34:49,533 --> 00:34:51,541
You have to keep a close eye on Ha Ha.

00:35:13,522 --> 00:35:16,394
- I tried to do it.
- We have four people left.

642
00:35:20,924 --> 00:35:22,784
[Start]

643
00:35:23,278 --> 00:35:26,202

You're eliminated.

648
00:35:41,163 --> 00:35:43,598
- You're out!
- Who was that?

649
00:35:43,598 --> 00:35:48,807
Who was it?
Was it you?

650
00:35:48,807 --> 00:35:51,002
- You're out.
- It was you.

651
00:35:51,002 --> 00:35:52,559
You're still out.

652

So he's out!

653
00:35:55,124 --> 00:35:58,392
<i>Okay there are three people left.
This could be the definitive round.</i>

654

- You won!
- Really?

660
00:36:29,936 --> 00:36:32,104
Why did you do that?

661
00:36:32,104 --> 00:36:33,625
You should have held it in.

662
00:36:33,981 --> 00:36:35,032
Oh really.

663
00:36:35,032 --> 00:36:39,667

I did well, right?

673
00:37:10,497 --> 00:37:10,945
- Sure he did...
- Five!

674
00:37:10,945 --> 00:37:16,169
- Six!
- Okay!

675

It's six? Who did six?

676
00:37:21,401 --> 00:37:23,434
Just let it go.

677
00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:28,695
- One more time, and we're done.
- It's a relief. We almost got caught.

678
00:37:29,191 --> 00:37:34,981
Let's do it like this. I'll call out one.
So don't call it out.

679
00:37:34,981 --> 00:37:36,838
- Okay, okay.
- I'm going to call out one.

680
00:37:36,838 --> 00:37:38,177
I'll do two.

681
00:37:38,177 --> 00:37:40,235
So when I call out two,
we do two.

682
00:37:40,235 --> 00:37:43,088
- I'm three. I'm three.
- I'm calling out two.

683

One, two, three.

684

You're a traitor.

685
00:37:49,912 --> 00:37:51,632
It's not possible otherwise.

686
00:37:51,632 --> 00:37:54,980
I told you guys. I'm doing one.

687
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:57,369
Okay, then let's try
to get these two out.

Why did you do that?

694
00:38:21,370 --> 00:38:23,982
That was good.

695
00:38:23,982 --> 00:38:25,677
Then let's do two, three, four.

696
00:38:25,677 --> 00:38:27,779
Sounds good.

697
00:38:28,123 --> 00:38:29,920

We're sorry Hyun Jin.

705
00:38:49,781 --> 00:38:52,630
We're really sorry.

706

- This was too...
- So funny.

Why aren't you getting mad?

Why am I eliminated?

726

You and Hyun Jin said four.

727

Hyun Jin, you and I think alike.

at the same time!

- They did it at the same time.
- What are you guys doing?

Only one person has to die.

- Hey then...
- Jae Suk's team wins.

746

- You were supposed to say one.
- You didn't either.

- It's so you.
- You have to wear it.

759

Is this a punishment?

00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:03,050
What do you mean punishment?

763
00:42:03,237 --> 00:42:05,890

- Let's go over there.
- Please take your positions.

767
00:42:17,047 --> 00:42:19,807

Lady Kwang Ja got the ball?

774

It's okay if we get hit, right?

775
00:42:52,792 --> 00:42:55,442
At least one of us can get out.

776
00:42:55,442 --> 00:42:56,777
Then it doesn't really matter.

777
00:43:00,245 --> 00:43:02,577
- Is that our ball?
- It's our ball.

778

Ryu Hyun Jin is amazing
with a ball!

You can't attack, but you can
pass from the outside.

798

Either catch it or avoid it.

00:45:46,734 --> 00:45:49,112
[Worried right away.]
Are you okay?

822
00:45:50,464 --> 00:45:53,707
- Seriously.
- Is this a love line or not?

823
00:45:53,707 --> 00:45:56,400
You know that it's not possible.

824
00:45:57,460 --> 00:46:00,806
This is a practice game.

825
00:46:00,806 --> 00:46:04,329
- Blue team has won.
- You should have blocked it.

826
00:46:04,329 --> 00:46:06,832
You should have blocked it.

827
00:46:08,373 --> 00:46:12,037
He said it like a lead actor.
'Are you okay?'

828
00:46:13,126 --> 00:46:14,513
Are you okay?

829
00:46:17,566 --> 00:46:20,786
He was very cool.

830
00:46:20,786 --> 00:46:23,591
- Hyun Jin is a beast.
- He's scary.

831
00:46:23,591 --> 00:46:28,122
- Ryu Hyun Jin's the best with a ball.
- We haven't caught the ball.

832
00:46:28,122 --> 00:46:34,343
<i>This time, if a team gets out,
they can still attack.</i>

833
00:46:34,343 --> 00:46:37,102
<i>But you can only help one team.</i>

834
00:46:37,102 --> 00:46:39,490
Get ready.

835
00:46:46,499 --> 00:46:49,100
[Yoo Hyuk out!]

836
00:46:52,495 --> 00:46:56,013
Seriously! I can still help,
so don't worry.

837
00:46:56,013 --> 00:47:00,733
Hyun Jin. Let's get them out first.

838
00:47:00,733 --> 00:47:03,364
They're unbeatable.

839
00:47:03,364 --> 00:47:05,997
That's right.
That's right!

840
00:47:12,836 --> 00:47:15,608
Kwang Soo got hit!

841
00:47:17,291 --> 00:47:21,370
[Again passes through the guards
and gets to Lady Kwang Ja's leg.]

842
00:47:21,370 --> 00:47:23,347
Kwang Soo got hit!

843
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:29,970
[The Traitors Club is out!]

844
00:47:32,679 --> 00:47:35,427
- Why are you so scary?
- Hold on.

845
00:47:35,427 --> 00:47:37,735
How did you hit me?

846
00:47:37,735 --> 00:47:40,588
We're attacking this team!

847
00:47:40,588 --> 00:47:43,366
- We were about to help you.
- We'll help.

848
00:47:43,366 --> 00:47:45,986
- You guys are fine.
- But we're in last place.

849
00:47:45,986 --> 00:47:48,912
But you're going to win.

850
00:47:50,531 --> 00:47:53,149
- Hyun Jin is really...
- He's really scary.

851
00:47:53,733 --> 00:47:55,580
This is not the dodgeball
we're used to.

852
00:47:55,580 --> 00:47:58,917
What? What's wrong?

853
00:47:58,917 --> 00:48:00,509
Good job.

854
00:48:00,509 --> 00:48:03,212
If you guys make a ruckus,
I'll throw this way.

855
00:48:03,212 --> 00:48:05,435
You guys will be dead.

856
00:48:05,435 --> 00:48:06,982
You'll hit the camera!

857
00:48:06,982 --> 00:48:09,076
He's really scary.

858
00:48:09,076 --> 00:48:10,718
I'm scared.

859
00:48:10,718 --> 00:48:13,579
What's wrong?
Come here, come here.

860
00:48:18,106 --> 00:48:20,681
[Kkuk is out!]

861
00:48:20,681 --> 00:48:21,839
He's a strong player though.

862
00:48:23,159 --> 00:48:24,353
Block her, block her.

863
00:48:27,131 --> 00:48:29,629
- Turn, turn!
- Kwang Soo!

864
00:48:32,549 --> 00:48:35,852
[Kwang Ja attacks]

865
00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:38,081
Your older sister will scold you!

866
00:48:38,081 --> 00:48:40,293
Your older sister!

867
00:48:40,873 --> 00:48:42,566
Good for you.

868
00:48:42,566 --> 00:48:44,716
Hold on, time out.

869
00:48:44,716 --> 00:48:47,698
- Ji Hyo, I'm sorry.
- Hyun Jin, you should have gone out first.

870
00:48:47,698 --> 00:48:49,079
I can't see well because of the sun.

871
00:49:04,510 --> 00:49:08,300
Gary come back!
He's rolling away!

872
00:49:12,216 --> 00:49:15,537
Just throw it now.

873
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:18,628
Be gentle!

874
00:49:23,902 --> 00:49:28,609
This is not the dodgeball we're used to.

875
00:49:28,609 --> 00:49:30,768
Wow, he's really strong.

876
00:49:34,340 --> 00:49:36,111
[Ji Hyo's in danger!]

877
00:49:36,111 --> 00:49:37,508
What are you doing?

878
00:49:48,090 --> 00:49:50,043
They're out?

879
00:49:50,043 --> 00:49:52,934
[Suzy's team wins!]
Very good!

880
00:49:52,934 --> 00:49:56,505
Good game, good game.

881
00:49:56,505 --> 00:49:59,274
We'll help you out.
We can do it.

882
00:49:59,274 --> 00:50:02,651
<i>If either the blue or yellow
team wins, it's victory.</i>

883
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:06,151
[Suzy's team is eventually all out]

884
00:50:06,151 --> 00:50:07,881
Get out. What are you doing?

885
00:50:07,881 --> 00:50:09,861
I said get out!

886
00:50:11,116 --> 00:50:13,633
Hyun Jin, it's yours!

887
00:50:16,942 --> 00:50:22,097
He's coming this way.

888
00:50:29,932 --> 00:50:32,582
[Hits the target!]

889
00:50:33,928 --> 00:50:36,631
[Hyun Jin's Amazing Attack!]

890
00:50:36,631 --> 00:50:41,553
[Just one gap.]

891
00:50:41,553 --> 00:50:44,491
[Makes it accurately through!]

892
00:50:45,310 --> 00:50:48,558
[This is the power of
the nation's best pitcher.]

893
00:50:48,558 --> 00:50:51,701
- What are you guys doing?
- That was amazing.

894
00:50:52,661 --> 00:50:56,913
Those are amazing skills.

895
00:50:56,913 --> 00:51:00,297
<i>The winner of dodgeball
is the blue team.</i>

896
00:51:01,644 --> 00:51:04,002
<i>Yellow team is second place.</i>

897
00:51:04,002 --> 00:51:05,237
<i>Red team is third place.</i>

898
00:51:05,237 --> 00:51:07,307
It's not as bad as you think.

899
00:51:07,307 --> 00:51:12,150
<i>We're suggesting the next game
to be couple's dodgeball.</i>

900
00:51:12,150 --> 00:51:16,007
<i>Ryu Hyun Jin and Suzy is one team.</i>

901
00:51:16,007 --> 00:51:18,466
<i>- Gary and Ji Hyo is another pair.
- Hold on.</i>

902
00:51:18,466 --> 00:51:24,701
Wait, what about us?

903
00:51:24,701 --> 00:51:29,049
Why? Just let them do it together.

904
00:51:29,049 --> 00:51:31,885
Then put Kwang Ja
and Jae Suk together.

905
00:51:33,749 --> 00:51:37,803
Us too. We'll be a team too, okay?

906
00:51:37,803 --> 00:51:40,126
Let's do this!

907
00:51:42,330 --> 00:51:43,908
Will bonus points be awarded?

908
00:51:43,908 --> 00:51:48,356
We'll provide additional provisions.

909
00:51:51,114 --> 00:51:53,685
We'll definitely win.

910
00:51:54,571 --> 00:51:57,955
Hyun Jin, you have to protect her well.
It's not just about the ball.

911
00:51:57,955 --> 00:52:00,805
I can't see anything.

912
00:52:00,805 --> 00:52:02,057
Get ready.

913
00:52:03,568 --> 00:52:07,494
Kwang Ja. Kwang Ja!

914
00:52:08,094 --> 00:52:10,941
Why does the girl have the ball?

915
00:52:10,941 --> 00:52:12,339
Kwang Ja!

916
00:52:12,787 --> 00:52:15,130
Throw it over there.

917
00:52:17,302 --> 00:52:19,157
I've got the ball!

918
00:52:19,157 --> 00:52:20,406
Be careful!

919
00:52:24,767 --> 00:52:27,795
Time out! Time, time, time!

920
00:52:30,514 --> 00:52:32,598
What are you doing?

921
00:52:32,598 --> 00:52:34,331
Why are you avoiding him?

922
00:52:35,452 --> 00:52:37,656
Why are you running away?

923
00:52:37,656 --> 00:52:41,468
Hyun Jin throws 150 km.

924
00:52:41,468 --> 00:52:43,695
<i>Kwang Ja couple. This is a warning.</i>

925
00:52:43,695 --> 00:52:44,983
- We understand.
- What are you doing?

926
00:52:48,781 --> 00:52:51,517
[Who's protecting who?]

927
00:52:58,446 --> 00:53:01,045
[I don't want to protect you.]

928
00:53:01,045 --> 00:53:04,405
[You get hit by that dodgeball.]

929
00:53:04,405 --> 00:53:06,020
Wait!

930
00:53:06,020 --> 00:53:08,330
Wait, we were on the floor!

931
00:53:09,306 --> 00:53:13,953
- Okay, it doesn't count?
- What do you mean? We're out!

932
00:53:13,953 --> 00:53:16,095
We're out.

933
00:53:17,374 --> 00:53:21,510
I don't love him enough
to risk my life to protect him.

934
00:53:21,510 --> 00:53:23,186
Then why are you meeting me?

935
00:53:23,186 --> 00:53:26,883
Give me all the designer
bags you bought me!

936
00:53:28,181 --> 00:53:30,252
- Do you want to throw it?
- Hyun Jin, over here.

937
00:53:30,686 --> 00:53:33,526
Hyun Jin, Jae Suk's right here.

938
00:53:39,236 --> 00:53:41,434
Hold on, hold on.

939
00:53:41,898 --> 00:53:43,195
I can't see anything.

940
00:53:43,811 --> 00:53:45,268
That's it Kwang Ja.
Throw it!

941
00:53:45,268 --> 00:53:47,174
- Throw it!
- What a joke.

942
00:53:47,772 --> 00:53:49,164
Get out.

943
00:53:49,164 --> 00:53:50,961
You useless man.
Get out!

944
00:53:51,291 --> 00:53:53,288
Get lost.

945
00:53:53,718 --> 00:53:58,131
- You throw it!
- Why? After all these years...

946
00:53:58,131 --> 00:53:59,176
Kwang Ja...

947
00:53:59,176 --> 00:54:01,121
Let's just break up
if you're going to be this way.

948
00:54:01,121 --> 00:54:02,452
I'll go for that team.

949
00:54:02,452 --> 00:54:05,276
If we go for this team,
we're over.

950
00:54:05,276 --> 00:54:07,389
If you throw it, and we
catch it, you're out.

951
00:54:08,675 --> 00:54:10,077
What are you doing?

952
00:54:13,184 --> 00:54:15,546
[Hits the target!]

953
00:54:15,546 --> 00:54:17,808
Are you okay?
You're okay, you're okay.

954
00:54:19,504 --> 00:54:22,511
Lower your head more.

955
00:54:22,511 --> 00:54:26,603
Jae Suk, I'm in danger.
What are you doing?

956
00:54:26,603 --> 00:54:29,124
Why are you dragging
me towards him?

957
00:54:29,538 --> 00:54:30,667
Jae Suk!

958
00:54:35,164 --> 00:54:37,671
[Kwang Ja couple, out!]

959
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:40,760
Let's wrap up the game.

960
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:42,860
He's too fast.

961
00:54:57,080 --> 00:54:59,364
You two!

962
00:54:59,364 --> 00:55:01,803
It just ended up that way!

963
00:55:01,803 --> 00:55:04,324
You don't have to be
hugging like that.

964
00:55:04,324 --> 00:55:08,441
Why did he hold me like this...

965
00:55:08,941 --> 00:55:12,483
- You don't have to hold each other.
- Why did you hold me like that?

966
00:55:12,483 --> 00:55:14,670
You're the one who leaned in.

967
00:55:24,451 --> 00:55:27,118
Hyun Jin, you're not good
at catching big balls.

968
00:55:27,118 --> 00:55:28,873
Just good at catching small balls.

969
00:55:32,733 --> 00:55:34,483
I hit her!

970
00:55:36,473 --> 00:55:37,740
I hit her!

971
00:55:39,173 --> 00:55:40,919
Kwang Ja's the best.

972
00:55:43,108 --> 00:55:45,108
<i>The love that Kwang Ja ended.</i>

973
00:55:46,094 --> 00:55:47,887
I'm sorry. I...

974
00:55:48,383 --> 00:55:50,395
Kwang Ja, how could you end it?

975
00:55:50,395 --> 00:55:52,223
I didn't mean to.

976
00:55:52,223 --> 00:55:56,120
- Something's strange.
- What happened?

977
00:55:56,120 --> 00:55:59,144
- What just happened?
- What did we just do?

978
00:55:59,541 --> 00:56:03,619
<i>The yellow team won the first game.</i>

979
00:56:05,466 --> 00:56:08,018
<i>Red team gets second place.</i>

980
00:56:08,282 --> 00:56:10,918
<i>Blue team gets third.</i>

981
00:56:10,918 --> 00:56:13,646
<i>Blue team wins dodgeball.</i>

982
00:56:14,504 --> 00:56:15,723
It's money.

983
00:56:16,255 --> 00:56:19,662
<i>Yellow team is in second.</i>

984
00:56:26,788 --> 00:56:33,125
<i>We'll give Ryu Hyun Jin and Kim Jong Kook
bonuses for couple dodgeball.</i>

985
00:56:33,125 --> 00:56:35,276
Wait hold on.
It's only W1000.

986
00:56:35,276 --> 00:56:37,892
It's like chump change for
elementary school students.

987
00:56:37,892 --> 00:56:40,853
- What are you giving us?
- I'm sorry.

988
00:56:41,271 --> 00:56:43,990
- Hold onto this.
- This is W1000.

989
00:56:43,990 --> 00:56:47,600
- Please give us W500.
- Just W100.

990
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:51,025
<i>You all got your MT allowance.</i>

991
00:56:51,025 --> 00:56:54,721
<i>Each team has to distribute
the money amongst themselves.</i>

992
00:56:57,198 --> 00:56:59,271
You can each have
W10,000 and W20,000.

993
00:56:59,678 --> 00:57:02,662
Suzy gets a bit more.

994
00:57:03,532 --> 00:57:06,113
<i>Okay, now we'll go to have dinner.</i>

995
00:57:09,342 --> 00:57:12,309
[Hyun Jin's eyes change
at the mention of dinner.]

996
00:57:12,969 --> 00:57:16,942
[Ryu-mes Bond Ryu Hyun Jin.]

997
00:57:16,942 --> 00:57:20,603
Finish dinner and have everyone
at the dinner table.

998
00:57:27,606 --> 00:57:30,398
[9 a.m. Seoul S Hotel]

999
00:57:32,952 --> 00:57:36,543
[The PD seems to be looking
for someone inside.]

1000
00:57:44,035 --> 00:57:47,327
[Someone is still not awake.]

1001
00:57:54,650 --> 00:57:58,805
[It is... Ryu Hyun Jin?]

1002
00:57:58,805 --> 00:58:04,874
<i>I have come to give you a command.</i>

1003
00:58:04,874 --> 00:58:08,228
<i>You will be shooting with the Running
Man members in an hour.</i>

1004
00:58:08,228 --> 00:58:09,395
Yes.

1005
00:58:12,761 --> 00:58:14,257
By myself?

1006
00:58:14,564 --> 00:58:15,808
<i>Yes.</i>

1007
00:58:15,808 --> 00:58:17,332
[Ryu Hyun Jin. You are a spy!]

1008
00:58:17,332 --> 00:58:20,950
[Secretly eliminate the Running Man team
and their special guest from dinner.]

1009
00:58:20,950 --> 00:58:24,576
<i>Ryu Hyun Jin, today you are a spy.</i>

1010
00:58:24,576 --> 00:58:28,978
<i>It is you against the seven
Running Man members.</i>

1011
00:58:28,978 --> 00:58:34,283
<i>Including the special guest,
there are eight people you must eliminate.</i>

1012
00:58:34,736 --> 00:58:42,378
<i>The concept of today's race
will be a late fall MT.</i>

1013
00:58:42,378 --> 00:58:45,761
<i>The highlight of the MT is dinner time.</i>

1014
00:58:45,761 --> 00:58:47,936
<i>That is when you make your move.</i>

1015
00:58:48,016 --> 00:58:51,222
<i>Your special weapon...</i>

1016
00:58:51,222 --> 00:58:53,668
<i>Here you go.</i>

1017
00:58:54,060 --> 00:58:56,379
Is it a water gun?

1018
00:58:57,388 --> 00:59:03,135
[Inside... as expected...
water guns!]

1019
00:59:04,980 --> 00:59:07,356
Wait. Is this a water gun too?

1020
00:59:07,356 --> 00:59:12,335
<i>Choose one of these special solutions.</i>

1021
00:59:12,335 --> 00:59:14,431
<i>They will go into your water guns.</i>

1022
00:59:14,431 --> 00:59:16,897
Pick the one you think
will stand out the least.

1023
00:59:18,546 --> 00:59:20,737
[The sky blue solution]

1024
00:59:21,187 --> 00:59:23,541
Now choose a water gun.

1025
00:59:30,928 --> 00:59:32,305
I'll do this one.

1026
00:59:32,826 --> 00:59:35,654
A turtle.

1027
00:59:35,759 --> 00:59:38,167
[A bit small for him...]

1028
00:59:38,167 --> 00:59:41,904
<i>You have chosen the turtle
water gun and solution.</i>

1029
00:59:41,904 --> 00:59:48,382
<i>You must secretly shoot the Running Man
members' name tags to get them out.</i>

1030
00:59:48,382 --> 00:59:49,842
[Best mission imaginable.]

1031
00:59:49,842 --> 00:59:51,872
- Are you confident?
- Yes.

1032
00:59:51,872 --> 00:59:56,485
I can always wear my poker face.

1033
00:59:56,485 --> 00:59:58,251
I can do this.

1034
00:59:58,251 --> 01:00:01,757
- You can't get caught.
- Of course. I won't.

1035
01:00:01,757 --> 01:00:05,171
[Can Ryu Hyun Jin do it?]

1036
01:00:05,171 --> 01:00:09,034
<i>There's something you always
do with a water gun.</i>

1037
01:00:09,034 --> 01:00:11,628
<i>Strike a pose for the camera.</i>

1038
01:00:12,323 --> 01:00:15,168
[Korean Monster.
His mission starts now.]

1039
01:00:17,636 --> 01:00:19,777
[5:30 p.m. Kyung Ki Do
Gwang Ju's 'H' Village]

1040
01:00:19,777 --> 01:00:21,468
Let's get out!

1041
01:00:24,137 --> 01:00:27,055
Is this a place to cook?

1042
01:00:27,414 --> 01:00:31,238
[A cooking set up awaits the members
on the front patio.]

1043
01:00:31,587 --> 01:00:33,256
Let's start.

1044
01:00:33,256 --> 01:00:34,961
I'm not bad at cooking.

1045
01:00:34,961 --> 01:00:36,647
It's okay. Jae Suk's good at cooking.

1046
01:00:36,647 --> 01:00:38,868
<i>It's time for dinner.</i>

1047
01:00:38,868 --> 01:00:40,792
<i>It's the highlight of MT.</i>

1048
01:00:40,792 --> 01:00:42,442
- You're hungry, right?
- Yes!

1049
01:00:42,442 --> 01:00:46,494
<i>So we have prepared
the MT cooking battle.</i>

1050
01:00:46,494 --> 01:00:47,787
A cooking battle?

1051
01:00:47,787 --> 01:00:50,726
<i>The MT cooking battle.</i>

1052
01:00:50,726 --> 01:00:53,735
<i>There's going to be an MT cooking battle.</i>

1053
01:00:53,735 --> 01:01:01,053
<i>You have from when the battle starts
to when the eight finish and sit down to eat.</i>

1054
01:01:01,053 --> 01:01:05,726
<i>If you can get all of them
out by then, you win.</i>

1055
01:01:05,726 --> 01:01:10,721
<i>If the members catch you in the act
before then, the members win.</i>

1056
01:01:12,803 --> 01:01:16,508
<i>It's the MT cooking battle.</i>

1057
01:01:17,002 --> 01:01:20,026
Is it really the highlight
of MT to cook?

1058
01:01:20,472 --> 01:01:23,400
Isn't a campfire the highlight?
A campfire?

1059
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:26,137
When we did MT, we were
so tired we just ordered in.

1060
01:01:26,663 --> 01:01:30,190
We don't usually cook like this.

1061
01:01:30,190 --> 01:01:32,943
- We'll give you two hours.
- Who are the judges?

1062
01:01:32,943 --> 01:01:35,795
- We'll tell you.
- I'm sorry.

1063
01:01:35,795 --> 01:01:37,505
I'm hungry.

1064
01:01:37,505 --> 01:01:40,931
<i>You will eat the food you cook.</i>

1065
01:01:40,931 --> 01:01:45,818
<i>Then you will vote and the dish with
the highest number of votes will win.</i>

1066
01:01:45,818 --> 01:01:48,314
We could make mandoo.

1067
01:01:48,314 --> 01:01:50,285
We could fry the mandoo.

1068
01:01:50,285 --> 01:01:52,316
<i>If you make mandoo,
you'll have to fold it from scratch.</i>

1069
01:01:52,316 --> 01:01:53,946
You're kidding me!

1070
01:01:53,946 --> 01:01:57,099
If we're using cow, do we need
to catch it ourselves?

1071
01:01:57,099 --> 01:01:58,600
Let's catch it.

1072
01:01:58,600 --> 01:02:01,620
So we make the mandoo
wrap from scratch, too?

1073
01:02:01,620 --> 01:02:03,600
If we're making curry,
do we have to go to India?

1074
01:02:04,136 --> 01:02:06,392
- Do we?
- Let's go together.

1075
01:02:08,532 --> 01:02:11,362
- What are you saying?
- I thought she wanted to go together.

1076
01:02:11,362 --> 01:02:12,910
Curry would be nice.

1077
01:02:12,910 --> 01:02:15,193
[Everyone's laughing,
but he's keeping poker face.]

1078
01:02:16,469 --> 01:02:17,861
Jjajang would be nice.

1079
01:02:18,807 --> 01:02:22,259
Jjajang? They're making curry
so why bother?

1080
01:02:22,789 --> 01:02:28,210
Why are you over here?
Leave us alone.

1081
01:02:28,210 --> 01:02:31,541
You're annoying us.

1082
01:02:31,541 --> 01:02:34,164
We should talk about it.

1083
01:02:34,164 --> 01:02:35,781
Who's going to the market?

1084
01:02:35,781 --> 01:02:39,285
Jae Suk's going to the market?

1085
01:02:39,465 --> 01:02:41,143
But you have to write down
what we need.

1086
01:02:41,143 --> 01:02:42,625
Stay here and play with Suzy.

1087
01:02:42,625 --> 01:02:44,081
I'll go.

1088
01:02:44,081 --> 01:02:45,557
- No, no.
- I'll go.

1089
01:02:49,616 --> 01:02:51,823
[Nervous Hyun Jin.
Will he be able to do well?]

1090
01:02:52,998 --> 01:02:54,238
Thank you.

1091
01:02:54,681 --> 01:02:57,410
Hello.
Hurry let's get on.

1092
01:02:58,002 --> 01:03:00,302
- Hey kid!
- What?

1093
01:03:00,302 --> 01:03:01,670
You want to die?

1094
01:03:02,126 --> 01:03:05,157
Oink, oink, oink, oink.

1095
01:03:05,157 --> 01:03:06,659
Is the supermarket far?

1096
01:03:06,659 --> 01:03:09,637
[How will he shoot them
with the water gun?]

1097
01:03:10,561 --> 01:03:13,987
How to make curry deliciously.

1098
01:03:14,404 --> 01:03:17,537
Did you cook for yourself
when you were in America?

1099
01:03:17,757 --> 01:03:20,488
- You didn't?
- Hyun Jin always bought food.

1100
01:03:20,488 --> 01:03:22,962
But how did you have dinner?

1101
01:03:23,373 --> 01:03:25,221
My parents were there.

1102
01:03:26,409 --> 01:03:28,837
What do you want
to eat most? Curry?

1103
01:03:28,837 --> 01:03:31,214
I want to eat ddukbokgi,
soondae, and oh daeng.

1104
01:03:32,658 --> 01:03:37,020
[But I have something
more urgent to tend to...]

1105
01:03:42,805 --> 01:03:44,775
The sweet potatoes will be really good.

1106
01:03:44,775 --> 01:03:48,059
You could skewer them
and roast them.

1107
01:03:48,059 --> 01:03:51,090
Salted potatoes would
be really good too.

1108
01:03:51,090 --> 01:03:52,111
Oh my god.

1109
01:03:52,111 --> 01:03:53,816
Suzy have you had boppki?
(Korean sugar cookies)

1110
01:03:53,817 --> 01:03:55,221
Boppki?

1111
01:03:55,870 --> 01:03:57,987
I've made it before.

1112
01:03:57,987 --> 01:04:00,858
I made it in front of the school.

1113
01:04:00,858 --> 01:04:02,882
- You do things like that these days?
- Of course.

1114
01:04:03,705 --> 01:04:07,021
What do we do?
We need sugar for this.

1115
01:04:07,021 --> 01:04:08,221
We just need two of them.

1116
01:04:17,270 --> 01:04:20,272
It's all going to go in.

1117
01:04:20,272 --> 01:04:22,427
[Doubtful...]

1118
01:04:22,427 --> 01:04:25,114
You're a difficult child, aren't you?

1119
01:04:25,114 --> 01:04:26,271
She's fussy.

1120
01:04:26,271 --> 01:04:29,017
- Go over and help him.
- Nevermind.

1121
01:04:30,411 --> 01:04:32,244
[Meanwhile...]

1122
01:04:32,244 --> 01:04:35,208
I heard Puig is a real troublemaker.

1123
01:04:35,208 --> 01:04:38,113
He never stays still.

1124
01:04:38,113 --> 01:04:40,661
I think you're worse.

1125
01:04:41,152 --> 01:04:44,134
I heard Puig is really mischievous.

1126
01:04:44,134 --> 01:04:48,346
I learn all my mischievousness
from the other players.

1127
01:04:48,346 --> 01:04:51,005
All their arms are this big.

1128
01:04:51,005 --> 01:04:53,259
- Look at Puig's body.
- Steamed buns, mandoo...

1129
01:04:53,259 --> 01:04:56,270
Hyun Jin's body too.

1130
01:04:56,270 --> 01:04:57,980
What are you doing right now?

1131
01:04:57,980 --> 01:04:59,935
Steamed buns, mandoo...

1132
01:04:59,935 --> 01:05:01,775
[Must focus on spy mission.]

1133
01:05:02,768 --> 01:05:05,525
[Finally arrives at the market.]

1134
01:05:06,786 --> 01:05:09,528
- Let's skip the ddukbokgi.
- Sure, sure. Hyun Jin!

1135
01:05:10,526 --> 01:05:11,914
Let's eat this.

1136
01:05:11,914 --> 01:05:13,515
These are fishcakes!

1137
01:05:13,515 --> 01:05:15,071
Hello!

1138
01:05:15,767 --> 01:05:17,594
Ma'am. How much is this?

1139
01:05:17,594 --> 01:05:19,615
- Three for W1000.
- Oh, that's perfect.

1140
01:05:19,615 --> 01:05:21,504
- Can we have one?
- Of course, of course.

1141
01:05:21,504 --> 01:05:23,310
Are you paying for this Jae Suk?

1142
01:05:24,154 --> 01:05:26,254
Thanks Jae Suk.

1143
01:05:26,847 --> 01:05:28,660
Sure, it's on me.

1144
01:05:28,810 --> 01:05:30,669
Oh, it's so good!

1145
01:05:32,610 --> 01:05:34,644
Hyun Jin, are you getting
broth for us?

1146
01:05:34,644 --> 01:05:36,379
He has such good manners.

1147
01:05:36,803 --> 01:05:39,491
This warm broth is so nice.

1148
01:05:40,568 --> 01:05:42,362
It's the best.

1149
01:05:43,229 --> 01:05:45,125
Hyun Jin, don't you miss this?

1150
01:05:46,345 --> 01:05:48,999
You can't have stuff like this
in America.

1151
01:05:48,999 --> 01:05:51,408
Fishcake broth is perfect
for chilly weather.

1152
01:05:55,792 --> 01:05:59,110
Oh yeah. Suzy said she
wanted goldfish cake.

1153
01:05:59,110 --> 01:06:00,166
Did she?

1154
01:06:00,166 --> 01:06:03,100
- When we come back out.
- We'll wrap some up for her.

1155
01:06:05,023 --> 01:06:08,564
- I'll wrap it up for you.
- Thank you.

1156
01:06:08,564 --> 01:06:10,713
Thanks again ma'am.

1157
01:06:11,867 --> 01:06:14,133
- Where are you going?
- Hyun Jin where are you going?

1158
01:06:14,133 --> 01:06:15,849
To eat ddukbokgi.

1159
01:06:15,849 --> 01:06:17,599
We'll have that later.

1160
01:06:17,599 --> 01:06:20,737
We'll buy it. There are
stands everywhere.

1161
01:06:21,233 --> 01:06:23,778
Oh, here's what we need.

1162
01:06:24,182 --> 01:06:27,904
We need ricecake and pickled radish.

1163
01:06:28,427 --> 01:06:31,498
- Onions.
- Oh ddukbokkgi. Very good.

1164
01:06:31,498 --> 01:06:35,684
Do you have the meat
that goes into curry?

1165
01:06:37,371 --> 01:06:40,614
One piece is 600 grams?

1166
01:06:40,614 --> 01:06:41,995
Is that enough?

1167
01:06:41,995 --> 01:06:43,386
What are you doing?

1168
01:06:43,386 --> 01:06:45,300
- Curry.
- Of course.

1169
01:06:45,917 --> 01:06:48,725
We need tenderloin.

1170
01:06:48,725 --> 01:06:50,069
Beef tenderloin.

1171
01:06:50,069 --> 01:06:51,421
Beef tenderloin?

1172
01:06:52,231 --> 01:06:54,279
You don't have any?
Tenderloin.

1173
01:06:55,640 --> 01:06:57,694
Don't have any?

1174
01:07:09,309 --> 01:07:12,028
This, this. Give me this,
what is this?

1175
01:07:12,028 --> 01:07:13,200
Yes, this please.

1176
01:07:14,448 --> 01:07:16,087
This please.

1177
01:07:19,651 --> 01:07:23,267
[Target fixed!]

1178
01:07:26,006 --> 01:07:27,261
Yes, for ddukbokgi.

1179
01:07:27,261 --> 01:07:30,806
[He aimed well enough.]

1180
01:07:30,806 --> 01:07:35,495
[But he held it backwards
and shot his finger.]

1181
01:07:36,171 --> 01:07:38,477
It's for ddukbokgi.

1182
01:07:40,540 --> 01:07:43,984
[Spy Hyun Jin must be nervous!
What an error!]

1183
01:07:43,984 --> 01:07:47,256
[What do I do?]

1184
01:07:47,256 --> 01:07:49,895
- Onions.
- Are you already done?

1185
01:07:49,895 --> 01:07:51,269
No.

1186
01:07:55,290 --> 01:07:56,740
I shot it backwards.

1187
01:07:58,222 --> 01:08:00,535
Ma'am, where's the fish?

1188
01:08:02,865 --> 01:08:09,338
Ma'am, can I have some anchovy?

1189
01:08:09,338 --> 01:08:11,084
[One more time.]

1190
01:08:11,084 --> 01:08:13,588
Kimchi, kimchi.

1191
01:08:16,466 --> 01:08:17,892
Is this it?

1192
01:08:20,333 --> 01:08:23,664
- This is, this is fine.
- Which one? This one?

1193
01:08:38,359 --> 01:08:42,488
[Successfully hits Ha Ha's name tag.]

1194
01:08:45,930 --> 01:08:48,323
Jae Suk, do we need
to buy the onions?

1195
01:08:48,323 --> 01:08:49,549
Do we need these onions?

1196
01:08:49,549 --> 01:08:52,934
- Do onions go into curry?
- I'm trying to make it chunky.

1197
01:08:52,934 --> 01:08:56,174
You need the other onion.

1198
01:09:01,272 --> 01:09:05,386
[Spy Hyun Jin. Of all 8 members,
targets only Ha Ha.]

1199
01:09:06,129 --> 01:09:08,571
[Meanwhile...]

1200
01:09:14,610 --> 01:09:18,767
- Oh very good.
- Just like that.

1201
01:09:19,670 --> 01:09:21,587
This is it.

1202
01:09:21,587 --> 01:09:22,942
Put it here.

1203
01:09:22,942 --> 01:09:25,603
It's done, it's done!

1204
01:09:25,603 --> 01:09:27,879
- Put it here.
- It's boppki!

1205
01:09:27,879 --> 01:09:29,375
Put it here.

1206
01:09:33,055 --> 01:09:36,200
Wow! We did it!

1207
01:09:36,200 --> 01:09:37,598
Did you do it well?

1208
01:09:39,071 --> 01:09:42,867
- Wow, this is well done.
- Put it like this.

1209
01:09:42,867 --> 01:09:45,790
R for Running Man.

1210
01:09:48,044 --> 01:09:49,913
It's not working.

1211
01:09:50,527 --> 01:09:53,422
- Wow, the smell.
- This is awesome.

1212
01:09:53,422 --> 01:09:55,402
- Awesome!
- Hurry, we have to put it here.

1213
01:09:55,402 --> 01:09:57,239
You have to put it here.

1214
01:09:59,385 --> 01:10:02,807
- Did you make a rose?
- No I was just trying to get it off.

1215
01:10:04,609 --> 01:10:07,756
[Suk Jin's is a bit...]

1216
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:11,467
[A pretty sugar cookie rose.]

1217
01:10:17,076 --> 01:10:18,383
Suk Jin, we can't eat this.

1218
01:10:19,085 --> 01:10:20,970
- We can eat it.
- You can't eat it.

1219
01:10:21,364 --> 01:10:23,537
- Eat it.
- Of course I can eat it.

1220
01:10:24,840 --> 01:10:27,102
Is it okay?

1221
01:10:27,880 --> 01:10:30,407
Hey, it's really good.

1222
01:10:36,945 --> 01:10:38,212
This is really good.

1223
01:10:40,588 --> 01:10:42,666
It's been a while since
I've had ddukbokgi like this.

1224
01:10:43,067 --> 01:10:44,268
I feel better.

1225
01:10:45,232 --> 01:10:46,930
- Good right?
- Really good.

1226
01:10:49,361 --> 01:10:50,768
Good, right Hyun Jin?

1227
01:10:50,768 --> 01:10:52,974
- But what do we do...
- How are you going to eat later?

1228
01:10:52,974 --> 01:10:54,231
I'm worried about that to.

1229
01:10:55,572 --> 01:10:58,169
- I'm really full.
- We won't be able to eat later.

1230
01:11:01,682 --> 01:11:05,995
[I still have to shoot Jae Suk.]

1231
01:11:07,305 --> 01:11:09,019
We're in big trouble.

1232
01:11:14,275 --> 01:11:17,851
I think I ate too much.

1233
01:11:17,851 --> 01:11:19,664
I'm full.

1234
01:11:21,026 --> 01:11:23,033
Thank you ma'am!

1235
01:11:23,033 --> 01:11:24,198
Goodbye.

1236
01:11:27,866 --> 01:11:33,869
Since Hyun Jin has to give
Suzy the goldfish cake...

1237
01:11:33,869 --> 01:11:35,681
Okay, you hold onto it.

1238
01:11:37,690 --> 01:11:39,007
You're going to eat more?

1239
01:11:39,390 --> 01:11:41,741
You said it was for Suzy.

1240
01:11:41,848 --> 01:11:43,958
But I really am full.

1241
01:11:43,958 --> 01:11:45,918
- What should we do?
- Wipe your mouth.

1242
01:11:45,918 --> 01:11:47,991
Wipe our mouths.

1243
01:11:49,689 --> 01:11:51,771
Seriously, where are they?

1244
01:11:51,771 --> 01:11:54,029
What are they doing?

1245
01:11:54,029 --> 01:11:56,519
- Why aren't they here?
- What have they been doing?

1246
01:11:59,831 --> 01:12:02,795
Stop eating.

1247
01:12:02,795 --> 01:12:04,700
What are you doing?

1248
01:12:04,700 --> 01:12:11,447
You're supposed to eat it bit by bit.
He put the whole thing in his mouth.

1249
01:12:12,547 --> 01:12:14,171
Just eat it all.

1250
01:12:14,171 --> 01:12:16,754
Wow. Is he an idiot?

1251
01:12:17,774 --> 01:12:20,154
- Where are they...
- Oh they're coming.

1252
01:12:20,557 --> 01:12:23,050
What took them so long
to get just that?

1253
01:12:23,050 --> 01:12:24,586
That's what took so long?

1254
01:12:24,586 --> 01:12:26,544
Let me inspect your mouths.

1255
01:12:26,544 --> 01:12:28,707
Let me smell your breath.

1256
01:12:28,707 --> 01:12:31,577
- There was a lot of traffic.
- Be honest.

1257
01:12:31,577 --> 01:12:32,766
You ate, right?

1258
01:12:32,766 --> 01:12:35,554
We bought stuff for us
to eat together.

1259
01:12:35,554 --> 01:12:38,177
- Come here.
- This is driving me crazy.

1260
01:12:38,177 --> 01:12:40,938
- Open your mouth.
- Really.

1261
01:12:40,938 --> 01:12:44,030
I can smell the grease from here.

1262
01:12:44,030 --> 01:12:45,792
Hyun Jin, come over here.

1263
01:12:48,669 --> 01:12:50,787
Let me go, let me go!

1264
01:12:50,787 --> 01:12:53,859
Ah, it hurts!

1265
01:12:55,002 --> 01:12:58,011
This is soondae?

1266
01:12:58,011 --> 01:13:01,496
Let's get dalgona ready for them.

1267
01:13:02,095 --> 01:13:05,562
- Let's get some Dalgona.
- Hyun Jin, come here.

1268
01:13:05,562 --> 01:13:08,084
Hyun Jin. Come here.
It's boppki.

1269
01:13:08,084 --> 01:13:09,544
Here you go.

1270
01:13:10,335 --> 01:13:12,676
He ate it all.

1271
01:13:14,363 --> 01:13:16,362
- What did you eat?
- I didn't have anything.

1272
01:13:16,362 --> 01:13:18,997
- It's all over your teeth.
- I really didn't have anything.

1273
01:13:18,997 --> 01:13:21,614
- There was no time.
- We can smell the grease.

1274
01:13:21,614 --> 01:13:24,421
- Yeah I smell the grease.
- What is that smell?

1275
01:13:24,665 --> 01:13:27,427
- Be honest.
- We had one goldfish cake.

1276
01:13:27,881 --> 01:13:30,869
We smell like grease because
we bought all this.

1277
01:13:32,240 --> 01:13:34,535
We were buying this.

1278
01:13:34,535 --> 01:13:39,190
You don't even eat so
why are you upset?

1279
01:13:39,190 --> 01:13:41,462
- Did you have fishcake?
- Yes!

1280
01:13:47,032 --> 01:13:49,010
We had fishcake broth.
Seriously.

1281
01:13:51,771 --> 01:13:55,432
- There's soda in here.
- He has something there.

1282
01:13:55,432 --> 01:13:57,196
He's hiding something there.

1283
01:13:58,876 --> 01:14:01,651
- What is it?
- It's Suzy's.

1284
01:14:03,377 --> 01:14:08,443
- Suzy, goldfish cakes.
- Get out of the way!

1285
01:14:09,331 --> 01:14:11,986
Get out of the way!

1286
01:14:11,986 --> 01:14:13,291
Do it again.

1287
01:14:13,291 --> 01:14:15,013
Oh, this warm moment.

1288
01:14:16,282 --> 01:14:17,310
What, what?

1289
01:14:18,919 --> 01:14:22,257
- What?
- You should get in the shot.

1290
01:14:22,257 --> 01:14:23,439
Should I put it back in?

1291
01:14:23,439 --> 01:14:24,515
Put it back in.

1292
01:14:24,515 --> 01:14:27,742
- Let's do it again.
- Okay, do over. No good.

1293
01:14:27,742 --> 01:14:29,777
Like it's the first time.

1294
01:14:29,777 --> 01:14:32,835
Suzy, make it happen.

1295
01:14:33,958 --> 01:14:35,773
Hey Hyun Jin, give it to her.

1296
01:14:35,773 --> 01:14:38,887
Suzy, I got you goldfish cakes.

1297
01:14:38,887 --> 01:14:40,543
Oh my...

1298
01:14:45,597 --> 01:14:47,809
Use the first version.
The first version.

1299
01:14:47,809 --> 01:14:49,867
This is really too much Suzy.

1300
01:14:49,867 --> 01:14:51,209
Suzy, such a player.

1301
01:14:51,560 --> 01:14:55,471
Suzy, you really always
ask for goldfish cake.

1302
01:14:55,471 --> 01:14:57,842
I really wanted some. Wow.

1303
01:14:58,457 --> 01:14:59,927
Wow.

1304
01:14:59,927 --> 01:15:03,600
- We need to have dinner, but you're eating.
- You set the table already?

1305
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:05,233
Let me have some.

1306
01:15:05,233 --> 01:15:06,383
Do you eat fishcake?

1307
01:15:08,590 --> 01:15:10,305
There's a lot he doesn't eat.

1308
01:15:11,676 --> 01:15:13,004
This is great.

1309
01:15:13,418 --> 01:15:15,955
<i>Everyone, it's not time to eat yet.</i>

1310
01:15:15,955 --> 01:15:19,305
<i>You've been told that this
is the MT cooking battle.</i>

1311
01:15:19,865 --> 01:15:22,624
We have no desire
to do that kind of battle.

1312
01:15:23,069 --> 01:15:26,097
Why do we need to battle for dinner?

1313
01:15:26,097 --> 01:15:28,909
- This is just a snack.
- This right here is an MT.

1314
01:15:28,909 --> 01:15:32,153
Everyone gathers around and enjoys.

1315
01:15:32,153 --> 01:15:33,844
Seriously.

1316
01:15:37,290 --> 01:15:39,602
- Have some goldfish cake.
- I had some already.

1317
01:15:39,602 --> 01:15:41,211
No.

1318
01:15:42,313 --> 01:15:44,339
This is something you eat
when you're younger.

1319
01:15:45,255 --> 01:15:47,495
What are you saying?

1320
01:15:47,846 --> 01:15:49,780
- What did I say?
- Are you in your right mind?

1321
01:15:53,798 --> 01:15:55,225
Just wash one side, right?

1322
01:15:59,360 --> 01:16:02,573
[He'll have to slowly resume
his spy mission.]

1323
01:16:02,573 --> 01:16:03,743
Let's go the two of us.

1324
01:16:03,743 --> 01:16:06,686
[What a stroke of luck.]

1325
01:16:06,748 --> 01:16:10,198
[He can get Mr. Capable.]

1326
01:16:12,208 --> 01:16:14,492
Is this the only faucet?

1327
01:16:14,878 --> 01:16:15,880
There's another one.

1328
01:16:15,880 --> 01:16:17,407
- Where?
- It's in the back.

1329
01:16:17,407 --> 01:16:18,766
Then go over there.

1330
01:16:30,927 --> 01:16:32,589
Wow, it's water.

1331
01:16:33,532 --> 01:16:35,909
Do you know how to wash this?

1332
01:16:37,133 --> 01:16:41,363
But it doesn't matter if you
wash these carrots.

1333
01:16:41,363 --> 01:16:42,913
You still have to wash it.

1334
01:16:42,913 --> 01:16:45,723
What are you talking about?
You still have to wash it.

1335
01:16:45,723 --> 01:16:47,632
Look at this.
Pre-washed carrots.

1336
01:16:47,632 --> 01:16:50,304
Really? I still think you
have to wash it.

1337
01:16:51,280 --> 01:16:53,774
If you bought it,
you should be telling me.

1338
01:16:53,774 --> 01:16:57,461
- Look. Pre-washed carrots.
- Okay, fine.

1339
01:16:57,714 --> 01:16:59,506
Over there.

1340
01:17:03,523 --> 01:17:05,737
Why do you use salt
for hard-boiled eggs?

1341
01:17:05,737 --> 01:17:07,091
Suzy, that's ours.

1342
01:17:07,492 --> 01:17:08,664
[No one's listening.]

1343
01:17:08,664 --> 01:17:10,504
We have to this well.

1344
01:17:12,539 --> 01:17:14,504
So that the shell peels well.

1345
01:17:14,504 --> 01:17:16,295
Thanks, you were listening.

1346
01:17:18,224 --> 01:17:21,596
Everyone, it seems no one
is listening to me, right?

1347
01:17:21,596 --> 01:17:23,577
But still...

1348
01:17:24,878 --> 01:17:27,093
Hey, it really seems like
an MT with you here.

1349
01:17:27,587 --> 01:17:30,255
It really seems like
an MT with Suzy here.

1350
01:17:31,975 --> 01:17:34,485
What are you doing?

1351
01:17:37,761 --> 01:17:40,724
[Meanwhile...]

1352
01:17:42,853 --> 01:17:44,605
Is this okay?

1353
01:17:48,559 --> 01:17:51,410
What are you doing here instead of
pitching for the Major Leagues?

1354
01:17:51,732 --> 01:17:53,839
Why? It's fun.

1355
01:17:54,647 --> 01:17:56,218
- I wanted to do things like this.
- Really?

1356
01:17:57,269 --> 01:17:59,188
Okay, that's fine.
Just one more left.

1357
01:17:59,569 --> 01:18:01,303
Did you peel this well?

1358
01:18:05,857 --> 01:18:09,288
You can peel this too.

1359
01:18:10,096 --> 01:18:11,349
I'll do the potatoes.

1360
01:18:11,349 --> 01:18:13,076
Be honest. What did
you eat with them?

1361
01:18:13,433 --> 01:18:14,493
What did you eat?

1362
01:18:14,843 --> 01:18:17,428
- Fishcakes.
- No really.

1363
01:18:17,428 --> 01:18:22,720
- Goldfish cakes.
- There's a reason I keep asking...

1364
01:18:24,069 --> 01:18:26,485
The reason I keep asking...

1365
01:18:30,621 --> 01:18:35,049
You should have bought more to eat.

1366
01:18:38,006 --> 01:18:41,519
And we needed more time to cook.

1367
01:18:41,519 --> 01:18:43,424
- And some more meat.
- There was nothing like that.

1368
01:18:43,424 --> 01:18:45,364
They would have given it to you.

1369
01:18:46,168 --> 01:18:48,043
They totally would have.

1370
01:18:49,544 --> 01:18:52,409
Just like this. Nice.

1371
01:18:54,573 --> 01:18:55,952
Jong Kook, we need to wrap up.

1372
01:18:57,165 --> 01:18:59,142
Very good Hyun Jin.

1373
01:18:59,142 --> 01:19:01,659
Why are you making me do everything?

1374
01:19:01,659 --> 01:19:03,640
You're closer to this than I am.

1375
01:19:04,066 --> 01:19:06,484
Very good. Don't spill it.

1376
01:19:06,484 --> 01:19:07,956
Let's go!

1377
01:19:08,795 --> 01:19:12,723
[Spy Hyun Jin hits two out of eight
Running Man members. Jong Kook hit!]

1378
01:19:14,431 --> 01:19:16,001
I'll cut the cabbage kind of big.

1379
01:19:17,224 --> 01:19:19,052
We're going to make ddukbokkgi broth.

1380
01:19:20,740 --> 01:19:23,266
- Why are you taking that?
- I'm just borrowing it.

1381
01:19:23,820 --> 01:19:26,704
- Let me just borrow it.
- We need that.

1382
01:19:26,704 --> 01:19:28,456
We're in the same boat here.

1383
01:19:28,456 --> 01:19:30,549
We're part of the same MT class.

1384
01:19:30,549 --> 01:19:31,976
- What class are you?
- Me?

1385
01:19:32,402 --> 01:19:35,041
- I'm the Broadcasting Entertainment class.
- Broadcasting entertainment.

1386
01:19:35,041 --> 01:19:36,535
I'm in the law school class.

1387
01:19:36,535 --> 01:19:37,720
What did you say?

1388
01:19:37,720 --> 01:19:40,021
- What's the first amendment?
- I'm not telling you.

1389
01:19:44,142 --> 01:19:46,736
I'm sorry, but are you
using all three fires?

1390
01:19:46,736 --> 01:19:49,052
That's right.

1391
01:19:50,061 --> 01:19:53,711
This is ridiculous.

1392
01:19:54,591 --> 01:19:56,523
Use that.

1393
01:19:59,378 --> 01:20:04,656
Wow, I really... I really
can't believe this.

1394
01:20:04,982 --> 01:20:07,537
Just like this.

1395
01:20:07,537 --> 01:20:09,262
This is going to turn out really well.

1396
01:20:12,511 --> 01:20:14,266
Oh, it's here.

1397
01:20:14,746 --> 01:20:17,394
- Jong Kook. Seriously!
- Why?

1398
01:20:17,394 --> 01:20:18,962
He keeps bossing me around.

1399
01:20:18,962 --> 01:20:20,541
What do you mean?
I did everything.

1400
01:20:20,541 --> 01:20:24,344
And did you wash the potatoes?

1401
01:20:26,354 --> 01:20:28,289
We need a big pot.

1402
01:20:31,479 --> 01:20:35,284
[Just six more left.]

1403
01:20:35,732 --> 01:20:39,303
- Let it boil.
- Why are you putting in so much dashima?

1404
01:20:40,072 --> 01:20:42,394
It's not that much.

1405
01:20:42,394 --> 01:20:44,238
Too fishy to eat.

1406
01:20:44,238 --> 01:20:45,795
How is this fishy?

1407
01:20:45,795 --> 01:20:48,518
- You put in too much.
- Put in more water.

1408
01:20:54,284 --> 01:20:57,075
[It does seem like there's too much.]

1409
01:20:57,075 --> 01:21:00,191
[Puts it into the Traitor team's pot.]

1410
01:21:00,191 --> 01:21:02,476
I put some dashima in.

1411
01:21:02,793 --> 01:21:05,060
I'll do it here.

1412
01:21:05,532 --> 01:21:08,201
- It's going to be so fishy.
- Just you taste it.

1413
01:21:09,544 --> 01:21:12,106
This smells amazing.

1414
01:21:12,106 --> 01:21:13,668
The broth is amazing.

1415
01:21:14,675 --> 01:21:17,386
This much will be perfect.

1416
01:21:17,881 --> 01:21:21,120
[Doesn't notice the added dashima.]

1417
01:21:23,060 --> 01:21:25,498
Can we pick it with our hands?

1418
01:21:26,696 --> 01:21:27,914
[Hyun Jin gets ready to attack.]

1419
01:21:27,914 --> 01:21:31,487
Don't we have to pick this well?

1420
01:21:31,487 --> 01:21:32,593
We can pick it well.

1421
01:21:33,830 --> 01:21:35,386
Thanks.

1422
01:21:49,779 --> 01:21:52,296
[Kwang Soo's name tag hit!]

1423
01:21:52,296 --> 01:21:55,096
[Spy Hyun Jin. Three out of the eight
Running Man members done. Kwang Soo hit!]

1424
01:21:55,473 --> 01:21:56,724
Where the onion?

1425
01:21:58,908 --> 01:22:00,496
There's the onion!

1426
01:22:00,496 --> 01:22:01,625
Where?

1427
01:22:01,625 --> 01:22:04,443
There are pumpkins here too.

1428
01:22:06,853 --> 01:22:09,075
[Acts as if he's joking around.]

1429
01:22:09,784 --> 01:22:12,800
Suzy, you said you need young radish.

1430
01:22:12,800 --> 01:22:15,270
- I want greens.
- Greens? What will you do with that?

1431
01:22:15,770 --> 01:22:19,264
I'll think of it later.
I just want to pick some for now.

1432
01:22:19,973 --> 01:22:22,020
You have no idea, huh?

1433
01:22:23,796 --> 01:22:25,298
What will you do with the onions?

1434
01:22:25,298 --> 01:22:30,345
- We're going to make ramen...
- That's so unimaginative.

1435
01:22:32,972 --> 01:22:35,651
You should be talking.

1436
01:22:35,651 --> 01:22:37,145
You didn't even hear me out.

1437
01:22:39,960 --> 01:22:41,583
It's a radish!

1438
01:22:43,439 --> 01:22:45,431
A young radish.

1439
01:22:46,753 --> 01:22:48,282
I was surprised.

1440
01:22:48,282 --> 01:22:50,397
I didn't know it looked like this.

1441
01:22:50,814 --> 01:22:53,049
It looks really pretty.

1442
01:22:53,049 --> 01:22:54,767
You want this, right Suzy?

1443
01:22:55,167 --> 01:22:58,545
How do you get young radish?

1444
01:22:58,939 --> 01:23:00,450
They're veggies.

1445
01:23:00,450 --> 01:23:02,580
- Get some greens.
- Are you going to do something with that?

1446
01:23:03,167 --> 01:23:06,196
You keep avoiding Suzy.

1447
01:23:07,414 --> 01:23:09,542
You have to leave for me
to play with Suzy.

1448
01:23:10,699 --> 01:23:11,915
- You want me to leave?
- Yeah.

1449
01:23:12,341 --> 01:23:14,110
So you're leaving?

1450
01:23:14,110 --> 01:23:16,071
I was going to leave anyway.

1451
01:23:16,071 --> 01:23:17,770
I don't think so.

1452
01:23:18,686 --> 01:23:20,207
There are no plump ones.

1453
01:23:20,207 --> 01:23:22,679
Young radish...

1454
01:23:31,254 --> 01:23:33,538
Where did you get the ones
from before?

1455
01:23:33,884 --> 01:23:37,556
- I didn't get it. Kwang Soo did.
- But how?

1456
01:23:38,888 --> 01:23:40,012
Suzy.

1457
01:23:40,012 --> 01:23:41,446
- Suzy.
- Yes?

1458
01:23:41,446 --> 01:23:44,054
We need more young radishes.

1459
01:23:44,833 --> 01:23:47,846
[Target fixed.]

1460
01:23:50,628 --> 01:23:52,729
Young radish?

1461
01:23:52,729 --> 01:23:55,627
[Suzy's name tag hit!]

1462
01:23:55,627 --> 01:23:58,375
[The special solution hit quite accurately.]

1463
01:23:58,699 --> 01:24:00,913
We need more young radishes.

1464
01:24:00,913 --> 01:24:02,341
Young radishes?

1465
01:24:03,677 --> 01:24:05,411
But that's another team?

1466
01:24:05,411 --> 01:24:07,681
No, we need it for everyone.

1467
01:24:07,681 --> 01:24:10,026
- We need more radishes.
- Why get more radishes?

1468
01:24:10,026 --> 01:24:11,385
We won't even eat it.

1469
01:24:11,760 --> 01:24:13,135
Seriously...

1470
01:24:13,531 --> 01:24:17,766
I'm just trying to feed you!

1471
01:24:17,766 --> 01:24:19,463
So frustrating!

1472
01:24:20,036 --> 01:24:21,936
He seems upset.

1473
01:24:23,725 --> 01:24:27,032
[Spy Hyung Jin. Four out of eight
Running Man members done. Suzy hit!]

1474
01:24:36,811 --> 01:24:38,372
How many potatoes do we need?

1475
01:24:38,797 --> 01:24:41,329
We're making ddukbokgi broth.

1476
01:24:42,425 --> 01:24:45,010
What are you doing here?

1477
01:24:45,010 --> 01:24:47,794
- It's ours to eat.
- It's that good.

1478
01:24:48,962 --> 01:24:51,866
Mister. Either eat it or put it back.

1479
01:24:52,384 --> 01:24:54,718
- Either eat it or not.
- Do you want some?

1480
01:24:54,718 --> 01:24:56,141
Seriously...

1481
01:24:59,930 --> 01:25:01,724
Be honest. It tastes good.

1482
01:25:02,074 --> 01:25:03,685
Good, right?

1483
01:25:04,089 --> 01:25:07,256
It's just that the fishcake is good.

1484
01:25:07,256 --> 01:25:09,533
There's a reason this broth is so good.

1485
01:25:10,810 --> 01:25:12,229
- Now Gary...
- Potatoes!

1486
01:25:12,229 --> 01:25:13,765
- Where were you?
- You have something for us?

1487
01:25:13,765 --> 01:25:15,871
Potatoes and onions.

1488
01:25:15,871 --> 01:25:17,986
Young radish and onions.

1489
01:25:17,986 --> 01:25:19,499
We picked it ourselves.

1490
01:25:19,499 --> 01:25:21,367
What should we do with all this?

1491
01:25:21,367 --> 01:25:22,720
Young radish bibimbap.

1492
01:25:22,720 --> 01:25:24,031
Young radish bibimbap?

1493
01:25:24,439 --> 01:25:26,346
With raw radish?

1494
01:25:28,897 --> 01:25:34,291
<i>The red team said
they needed red pepper paste.</i>

1495
01:25:34,291 --> 01:25:39,587
<i>- There's some in the pantry.
- We're done.</i>

1496
01:25:39,587 --> 01:25:43,585
<i>So if anyone needs sauce....</i>

1497
01:25:43,585 --> 01:25:45,091
<i>please head out together.</i>

1498
01:25:45,091 --> 01:25:46,784
- Where do we go?
- Get some for us.

1499
01:25:47,122 --> 01:25:50,818
Hey, just go with us.

1500
01:25:50,818 --> 01:25:53,415
Oh seriously.

1501
01:25:53,415 --> 01:25:57,076
- Just do it for us.
- Get it yourself.

1502
01:25:57,076 --> 01:26:02,403
[Silently follows as soon
as Suk Jin leaves.]

1503
01:26:02,403 --> 01:26:03,727

1504

[I'll be right back...]

1505
01:26:07,926 --> 01:26:10,332
Wow, this is totally...

1506
01:26:10,332 --> 01:26:13,140
This is just like ancient times.

1507
01:26:15,612 --> 01:26:16,789
Red pepper paste.

1508
01:26:17,377 --> 01:26:18,891
What kind of sauce do you need?

1509
01:26:18,891 --> 01:26:21,914
We need half-half.
Half red pepper paste, half samjang.

1510
01:26:23,648 --> 01:26:26,447
- What are you doing?
- What? Is it good?

1511
01:26:27,034 --> 01:26:29,007

around we would have caught him.

Hyun Jin put his arm around my shoulder
when we came back from the pastes.

1620
01:34:17,744 --> 01:34:24,991
He put his arm around my shoulder
so I thought we were a lot closer.

1621
01:34:24,991 --> 01:34:26,661
So this was the reason!

1622
01:34:26,661 --> 01:34:32,961
