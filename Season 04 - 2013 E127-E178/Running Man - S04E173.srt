[A totally upgraded
psychic baseball has returned.]

4
00:00:14,708 --> 00:00:18,419
[A fantastical game with legendary players.]

5
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:19,879
[Extraordinary!]

6
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:21,493
[Uproarious laughter!]

7
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:23,936
[Even though fall baseball games may be over,
psychic baseball is still alive.]

[Suzy makes another comeback
to Running Man.]

00:00:33,472 --> 00:00:36,157
[Late fall MT along with
members of the Running Man cast.]

13
00:00:37,626 --> 00:00:40,280
[And in the midst of the MT,
Ryu Hyun Jin succeeds his secret mission.]

14

<i>Do you all know what 'MT'
stands for?</i>

19
00:00:58,003 --> 00:00:59,485
Yes, I do!

- Mountain teenager?
- Mountain trouble?

21
00:01:01,748 --> 00:01:03,542
It stands for, 'Membership Training'.

22
00:01:03,543 --> 00:01:06,812
- Yes, it stands for 'membership training.'
- You think we actually didn't know that?

23
00:01:07,331 --> 00:01:09,695
- I really didn't know.
- Our MT Trip...

24
00:01:09,968 --> 00:01:14,753
<i>Our MT trip actually stood for
'Money is Time'.</i>

25
00:01:15,841 --> 00:01:19,573
<i>You all have money that you've
earned throughout the day, right?</i>

26
00:01:19,574 --> 00:01:22,444
<i>You'll be trading in your money for time.</i>

27
00:01:23,494 --> 00:01:28,876
<i>The time you've earned is the time you'll be
allotted to participate in the final mission.</i>

28

<i>Please check how much you've
each earned.</i>

29
00:01:31,376 --> 00:01:34,739
- 13,000 won.
- I have 25,000 won.

30
00:01:35,116 --> 00:01:37,234
<i>He earned an extra 8,000 won for
succeeding his spy mission.</i>

What's your deal?

32
00:01:41,772 --> 00:01:43,702
Then just give me 1,000 won
out of your stash.

33
00:01:43,703 --> 00:01:44,737
Just give me 1,000 won.
There you go.

34
00:01:44,737 --> 00:01:47,894
[Generously giving out 1,000 won
to his own team members.]

35
00:01:48,694 --> 00:01:51,653
- Give me 1,000 won too.
- I will now tell you your final mission.

36
00:01:51,654 --> 00:01:55,157
<i>You have to find the pillows that we
have hidden throughout this place.</i>

37
00:01:55,750 --> 00:02:00,467
<i>You either have to find the pillows that
have been marked with an 'R' or steal it.</i>

38
00:02:00,502 --> 00:02:02,042
<i>If you look over there,
you will find your sleeping quarters.</i>

39
00:02:02,043 --> 00:02:04,698
<i>If you look inside the sleeping quarters,
you will see some blankets laid out.</i>

40
00:02:05,141 --> 00:02:09,048
<i>If you take the pillows you find and lay down
in the blanket, then you succeed.</i>

41
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:13,270
<i>The problem is,
we've only prepared six pillows.</i>

42
00:02:13,271 --> 00:02:15,354
- What about the other three?
- As for the remaining three people...

43
00:02:15,355 --> 00:02:18,458
<i>They won't be able to lay down in the bedding
since they don't have a pillow.</i>

44
00:02:18,579 --> 00:02:23,983
<i>The remaining three people have to wash the
dishes from the dinner you all enjoyed</i>

45
00:02:23,984 --> 00:02:26,166
<i>and have to finish cleaning up before
you can go into the sleeping quarters.</i>

46
00:02:26,557 --> 00:02:29,021
- I don't think I can do that.
- I hate washing dishes.

47
00:02:29,022 --> 00:02:31,616
- I was already thinking of doing them.
- There are so many dishes to wash.

48
00:02:32,688 --> 00:02:36,786
- Then why don't you wash the dishes?
- Why are you saying that? Don't say that.

49
00:02:36,821 --> 00:02:40,132
Every 1,000 won you have can be
traded in for one minute.

50
00:02:40,133 --> 00:02:42,587
- Then I only have 13 minutes?
- That's correct, 13 minutes.

51
00:02:42,588 --> 00:02:44,651
<i>- Then you know what you have, right?
- Yes.</i>

52
00:02:44,652 --> 00:02:48,951
<i>Suzy at the moment has the most amount
of money to be traded in for time.</i>

53
00:02:48,952 --> 00:02:52,334
<i>Suzy will be the first to start.
Start your mission!</i>

54
00:02:52,335 --> 00:02:54,799
[Suzy's off!]

55
00:02:55,583 --> 00:02:58,017

to find any here.</i>

[Where could they be?]

58
00:03:03,728 --> 00:03:05,862
There's not much time.

59
00:03:06,515 --> 00:03:09,495
- Gary, and Ryu Hyun Jin may now start.
- Has it already been a minute?

60
00:03:10,346 --> 00:03:13,005
The time is going by way too fast.

61
00:03:13,006 --> 00:03:16,801
- You guys don't have much time, do you?
- This is too much.

62
00:03:16,802 --> 00:03:19,029
[The three feeling apprehensive with
the little time they're allotted.]

63
00:03:19,722 --> 00:03:23,104
[Gary and Hyun Jin starts by searching
all the nearby areas.]

64
00:03:28,468 --> 00:03:29,748
What the heck?
You startled me!

65
00:03:31,367 --> 00:03:34,174
[Hefty Ryu scared off by the cute puppy.]

66
00:03:34,175 --> 00:03:36,310
What are you doing there, dog?

67
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,968
I don't see any pillows.

68
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:43,102
I don't think there are any
around here.

69
00:03:43,103 --> 00:03:44,772
I think this is the sleeping quarters.

70
00:03:46,584 --> 00:03:48,440
Ji Hyo may now start.

71
00:03:48,441 --> 00:03:50,090
[Ji Hyo's turn to start.]

72
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,473
[Searching the area around the carriage.]

73
00:03:55,474 --> 00:03:57,739
[I wonder if anyone's found any yet.]

74
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:03,104
[Discovers a pillow!]

75
00:04:10,321 --> 00:04:12,282
[Where are all the pillows?]

76
00:04:15,945 --> 00:04:18,236
[On top of the wooden platform below!]

77
00:04:18,772 --> 00:04:21,156
[There's a pillow!]

78
00:04:29,584 --> 00:04:30,735
Are those ducks?

79
00:04:30,736 --> 00:04:33,507
[Ducks taking their leisurely stroll.]

80
00:04:35,378 --> 00:04:37,121
[She must be looking for the pillows.]

81
00:04:37,622 --> 00:04:41,957
[Suzy finds her 'R' marked pillow.]

82
00:04:41,958 --> 00:04:43,282
[Huh?]

83
00:04:44,472 --> 00:04:45,921
That's so cool.

84
00:04:47,929 --> 00:04:51,196
Hang on a minute... what if
someone takes it away from me?

85
00:04:53,283 --> 00:04:55,993
[Gary searching in the lower village circle.]

86
00:04:57,289 --> 00:04:59,492
['R' marked pillow on top of the swings!]

87
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:02,507
Isn't this one of the pillows?

88
00:05:02,508 --> 00:05:03,889
It is!

89
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:06,819
[Hefty Ryu is headed his way!]

90
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:08,156
It's up way too high!

91
00:05:09,648 --> 00:05:10,980
No, hang on!

92
00:05:11,911 --> 00:05:13,428
You won't be able to reach it either.

93
00:05:13,429 --> 00:05:14,967
[Getting on top of the swing
without any hesitation.]

94
00:05:25,089 --> 00:05:27,236
[Hyun Jin gets the pillow!]

95
00:05:28,669 --> 00:05:29,993
Hey, you traitor!

96
00:05:34,102 --> 00:05:35,697
Did you find one too?

97
00:05:37,101 --> 00:05:38,513
Suzy, you found one too?

98
00:05:38,514 --> 00:05:41,368
[Members with the pillows are desperately
trying to find the sleeping quarters.]

99
00:05:43,698 --> 00:05:45,421
Ryu Hyun Jin found a pillow!

100
00:05:46,369 --> 00:05:48,103
Ryu Hyun Jin!

101
00:05:48,104 --> 00:05:49,551
We have to steal his pillow!

102
00:05:50,786 --> 00:05:53,775
Where did you find it?
Where did you get that from?

103
00:05:53,776 --> 00:05:56,557
- Where's the sleeping quarters?
- Where did you find that?

104
00:05:56,558 --> 00:05:57,955
[He did find the pillow,
but where's the sleeping quarters?]

105
00:06:00,428 --> 00:06:04,504
[The sleeping quarters are in the
lower village circle.]

106
00:06:05,092 --> 00:06:07,908
- No!
- I was the one who found it first.

107
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:09,228
[Still haven't been able to find
the sleeping quarters.]

108
00:06:09,229 --> 00:06:11,938
I think almost all the pillows
have been found already.

109
00:06:11,939 --> 00:06:13,832
There's no time to waste right now.

110
00:06:13,833 --> 00:06:16,154
Please give us a chance
and let us go.

111
00:06:16,155 --> 00:06:18,178
[These three are still waiting
for there to get started.]

112
00:06:18,179 --> 00:06:19,313
Just give us one chance.

113
00:06:19,314 --> 00:06:21,838
- When are you guys getting started?
- You found one?

114
00:06:23,561 --> 00:06:25,962
- You already found one?
- I looked everywhere around here.

115
00:06:25,963 --> 00:06:28,765
- You just wait.
- Fighting!

116
00:06:29,182 --> 00:06:30,841
I'm going to take hers away from her.

117
00:06:30,926 --> 00:06:33,964
[Blank Ji is running around desperately in
search of the sleeping quarters.]

118
00:06:33,965 --> 00:06:35,875
Hey, where did you find yours?

119
00:06:36,882 --> 00:06:38,544
Hey, come on.

120
00:06:38,545 --> 00:06:42,529
[Those who haven't find theirs
must steal one from others.]

121
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:45,068
- Tell me.
- Let go of me!

122
00:06:46,375 --> 00:06:47,838
Where's Suzy?

123
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,416
Where's Suzy?

124
00:06:52,599 --> 00:06:55,889
[Zero consideration. Warning Suzy
of Big-nose's imminent approach.]

125
00:06:57,732 --> 00:06:58,992
- Run faster!
- Come here!

126
00:06:58,993 --> 00:07:00,701
[Stop right there!]

127
00:07:00,702 --> 00:07:02,821
We have to find the sleeping quarters!

128
00:07:04,863 --> 00:07:09,314
[Cold hearted Big-nose
always going after the women.]

129
00:07:14,404 --> 00:07:16,682
[But...]

130
00:07:16,683 --> 00:07:20,716
[This is the sleeping quarters!]

131
00:07:22,494 --> 00:07:25,503
[A full out battle right in front
of the sleeping quarters!]

132
00:07:27,813 --> 00:07:29,759
[Is that where the sleeping quarters is?]

133
00:07:32,972 --> 00:07:36,068
[Hyun Jin arrives at the sleeping quarters
with his pillow in hand.]

134
00:07:37,764 --> 00:07:39,603
[Blank Ji also makes her careful approach.]

135
00:07:42,964 --> 00:07:45,587
- Rock paper scissors?
- No way! I stole it, so it's mine now!

136
00:07:46,415 --> 00:07:48,353
[Another thief, Haroro also arrives.]

137
00:07:54,218 --> 00:07:58,218
[Just who will take the possession of
Suzy's hard earned pillow?]

138
00:08:00,081 --> 00:08:02,539
[Kkuk finds his pillow from somewhere and
attempts to make a breakthrough to the room.]

139
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:09,117
My pillow!

140
00:08:10,966 --> 00:08:12,391
Where did they go?

141
00:08:13,008 --> 00:08:16,956
[All the members crowding in
like a pack of hungry wolves.]

142
00:08:21,578 --> 00:08:23,951
This is Suzy's.
Suzy!

143
00:08:24,365 --> 00:08:25,927
- Come here, I'll give it to you.
- We'll give it to you.

144
00:08:26,514 --> 00:08:28,060
Come and take it.
You can take it.

145
00:08:28,061 --> 00:08:29,731
[Rather than have someone else steal it,
they'd rather give it back to Suzy?]

146
00:08:29,732 --> 00:08:31,736
- We know that it's yours.
- You know that I wouldn't take yours.

147
00:08:31,737 --> 00:08:33,661
- Sorry.
- Here, you take it.

148
00:08:33,662 --> 00:08:36,195
Let's just give it to Suzy.
Let's not be like this, and give it to Suzy.

149
00:08:36,789 --> 00:08:38,141
Hurry up and get out of here.

150
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:40,499
- Just go, Suzy.
- There's still one left to find.

151
00:08:41,095 --> 00:08:42,663
- Was that the last one?
- No, there's still one left.

152
00:08:42,664 --> 00:08:45,687
[Why are they all following her after
telling her that she can keep it?]

153
00:08:45,688 --> 00:08:47,798
[Escape to the sleeping quarters!]

154
00:08:49,765 --> 00:08:51,206
Hey!
Stop right there!

155
00:08:53,119 --> 00:08:55,287
[That's what we thought...]

156
00:08:57,183 --> 00:08:58,845
[Hefty Ryu still hasn't claimed his bedding.]

157
00:08:58,846 --> 00:09:00,293
Is this the last one?

158
00:09:00,294 --> 00:09:01,708
- No.
- It's not, is it?

159
00:09:01,709 --> 00:09:03,977
No, it's not. Don't take it!
Don't take it from her!

160
00:09:03,978 --> 00:09:05,551
[Defending Suzy from the wolf pack.]

161
00:09:11,699 --> 00:09:14,216
[Hyun Jin becomes
the wolf pack's prey instead.]

162
00:09:16,967 --> 00:09:18,514
Who are you trying to look
cool in front of?

163
00:09:18,515 --> 00:09:20,525
[Escapes with his monstrous strength.]

164
00:09:21,617 --> 00:09:23,745
- Ji Hyo.
- There are two spots left.

165
00:09:23,746 --> 00:09:24,911
- Two left?
- Two?

166
00:09:25,855 --> 00:09:28,575
[Two spots still left.]

167
00:09:28,576 --> 00:09:30,530

- We have to get him.
- Let's just play rock, paper, scissors.

180

want to do the dishes either.]

and wash something of your own!

242

- There are plenty of dirty dishes here.
- Why are you re-washing Jae Suk's dishes?

243

- I'm in.</i>

259
00:14:59,118 --> 00:15:00,900
- Good luck, Suk Jin.
- Bye!

260
00:15:00,901 --> 00:15:02,382
- There's not that much left.
- This is ridiculous.

261
00:15:02,383 --> 00:15:04,220
How could this have happened when
I'm normally so good at this?

262

the biggest advantage. You'd better get up.

- We're playing psychic baseball?

300

- We've come up with a new method to the game.
- Really?

301
00:18:12,021 --> 00:18:14,744
Hyun Jin told me that he was able to improve
on his batting skills because of us.

302

- Really?
- Yeah, he made that confession to us.

[Immediately blames Kwang Soo.]

333
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:53,596

[Big-nosed Brother finally catching on
to what's going on.]

335
00:19:57,190 --> 00:19:59,859
- No, we didn't plan anything.
- Suk Jin always threw out a scissors.

336
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:01,857
We should've thrown out a rock.

337
00:20:01,858 --> 00:20:04,158
- We should've started off with a 'rock'.
- We shouldn't have done that.

338
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:06,176
- Come on, Ji Hyo.
- You have to do it with us.

339
00:20:06,177 --> 00:20:07,862
If you think this is fun,
why not do it with us?

340
00:20:07,863 --> 00:20:09,879
[Trying to convince the ladies
to join in on their game?]

341
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:12,229
Look at how they're trying to be
sneaky just so that they could win.

342
00:20:12,983 --> 00:20:15,627
[Giraffe trying to get all the men
to throw out a 'rock'.]

343

344
00:20:18,038 --> 00:20:22,023
[Everyone throws out a 'rock'...
except for Jae Suk and Suzy.]

345
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:28,239
[Only Jae Suk and Suzy who didn't catch
on to the plan fails.]

346
00:20:31,925 --> 00:20:33,924
Did you not see what he was doing?

347
00:20:34,538 --> 00:20:36,374
You need to get your head
on straight.

348
00:20:36,375 --> 00:20:38,395
Didn't you see me throwing out a rock?

349
00:20:40,681 --> 00:20:44,043
- Suzy didn't know what you meant by that.
- She thought you were just cheering her on.

350
00:20:44,044 --> 00:20:46,476
So if I win this,
then Suzy has to do all the work?

351
00:20:47,017 --> 00:20:49,053
[Final round between Jae Suk and Suzy to
determine who'll clean up all the blankets.]

[Yoo Hyuk is chosen to clean up
all the blankets!]

354
00:20:58,152 --> 00:20:59,571
This is awesome!

355
00:20:59,572 --> 00:21:01,911
You guys are all traitors.

356
00:21:01,912 --> 00:21:03,875
I'm not going to let any of you
get away with this.

357
00:21:05,575 --> 00:21:07,543
- No, don't do any of that.
- Why?

358
00:21:07,544 --> 00:21:10,199
I'm not supposed to help?
You're right. It's no fun if we help.

359
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,761
[Adamant about not helping.]

360
00:21:16,231 --> 00:21:18,108
Come here, Kwang Soo.

361
00:21:21,887 --> 00:21:22,977
- Kwang Soo.
- Yes, Jae Suk?

362
00:21:22,978 --> 00:21:24,112
Come here for a minute.

363
00:21:24,113 --> 00:21:27,274
<i>- Are you not going to do anything?
- What do you expect me to do?</i>

364
00:21:33,044 --> 00:21:34,204
Look at him.

365
00:21:34,205 --> 00:21:37,279
Jae Suk, how can you try to prevent me
from being filmed on camera?

366
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,767
- You should've known better.
- He's trying to get me off the air!

367
00:21:39,768 --> 00:21:41,939
- Hey, Yoo Jae Suk!
- Don't you think you're being too much?

368
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:44,221
- I didn't do anything.
- I was just trying to get on film.

369
00:21:44,222 --> 00:21:46,925
But he told the cameraman to
get the camera off of my face.

370
00:21:49,436 --> 00:21:51,310
Why aren't you shooting anyone?

371

[An early morning teaching for
Giraffe and Ro-Ro.]

372
00:21:55,949 --> 00:21:57,834
We're finally doing this!

373
00:21:59,822 --> 00:22:01,792
Hyun Jin is three times the size of Suzy.

374
00:22:02,912 --> 00:22:04,291
Only three times the size?

375
00:22:06,402 --> 00:22:09,028
[He's sleepy all of a sudden?]

376
00:22:10,434 --> 00:22:12,742
- What's wrong with you?
- How can you suddenly be sleepy?

377
00:22:12,743 --> 00:22:15,108
- Are you embarrassed or something?
- You need to wake up.

378
00:22:15,276 --> 00:22:16,429
You're cute.

379
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:19,136
Hyun Jin was the only person who
looked after Suzy.

380
00:22:19,137 --> 00:22:20,889
- Yeah, you're right.
- I saw that too.

381
00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:23,960
You really can't forget about
the fish bread, Suzy.

382
00:22:23,961 --> 00:22:25,723
That's right, he bought her the bread too.

[Hyun Jin's gentle care for Suzy.]

384

There you go again, Gwon Yeol.

385
00:22:38,207 --> 00:22:40,889
Why are you shooting me all of a sudden?
You were only shooting Suzy before.

386
00:22:40,890 --> 00:22:42,851
That's what I don't like about you.

387
00:22:44,695 --> 00:22:47,092
He's been shooting Suzy all this time
with a smile on his face

388
00:22:47,093 --> 00:22:49,865
and then I see him suddenly
shift over to me.

389

<i>Before we explain the game to you...</i>

393
00:23:23,277 --> 00:23:24,917
Do we have to go out and buy
something again?

394
00:23:25,762 --> 00:23:27,389
What's that?
A step counter?

395
00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:29,797
- Make sure that it's set to zero.
- It is a step counter.

396

[Set it back to zero.]

that you get on the step counter...</i>

<i>you'll be able to earn your mission fee.</i>

399
00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:39,982
Really?

400

<i>The higher the number,
better it'll be for you.</i>

401
00:23:42,958 --> 00:23:45,283
<i>Is everyone set to zero?</i>

402
00:23:45,842 --> 00:23:48,859
- You have to shake it up and down.
- Start the music.

none other than Suzy.]

feminine side to Suzy.]

continuing to dance the same dance.]

[Huh?]

427
00:25:24,309 --> 00:25:26,724

00:29:24,509 --> 00:29:25,959
Suzy Q.

498
00:29:27,741 --> 00:29:29,181
[Fail]

499
00:29:34,698 --> 00:29:37,891
[An identifiable reaction from Suzy.]

500
00:29:40,439 --> 00:29:42,357
- What kind of a reaction was that?
- I've never seen that kind of a reaction.

501
00:29:42,358 --> 00:29:44,107
What was that?
A bird?

502
00:29:44,108 --> 00:29:45,721
[Next up is, Hefty Ryu.]

503
00:29:45,722 --> 00:29:46,774
Okay, second player up.

504
00:29:47,227 --> 00:29:49,389
<i>Please make sure to shout out, 'Challenge'
before you take your turn.</i>

505
00:29:49,390 --> 00:29:51,489
- But I didn't shout that out.
- Then you may go again.

506
00:29:55,101 --> 00:29:57,254
[Say what?]

507
00:29:58,259 --> 00:30:00,835
- What are you doing?
- You can't do that.

508
00:30:01,116 --> 00:30:04,775
- She didn't shout it out.
- Let's just let her go again.

509
00:30:05,599 --> 00:30:07,783
Are you switching it back around
for her because she's right handed?

510
00:30:08,505 --> 00:30:11,502
[Hefty Ryu's thoughtful gesture.]

511
00:30:11,503 --> 00:30:14,503
Seriously, Hyun Jin.
You're making us all look bad.

512
00:30:14,504 --> 00:30:17,630
[Teacher Kkuk starting his lessons again.]

513
00:30:17,631 --> 00:30:19,131
Just knock it off.

514
00:30:20,806 --> 00:30:23,732
[Everyone's starting to get annoyed
by Kkuk's nonstop meddling.]

515
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:28,409
- Just wait until I get my hands on you guys.
- Get out of the way, Mr. Turbo.

516
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:31,354
[Meddling Mr. Turbo.]

517
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,668
[Oh my!]

518
00:30:34,669 --> 00:30:37,243
[Hefty Ryu giving Suzy helpful hints.]

519
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:42,711
[How will she fare after his one pointer?]

520
00:30:48,138 --> 00:30:50,521
[Strike]

521
00:30:52,993 --> 00:30:54,877
- One strike!
- What is that thing she does?

522
00:30:58,844 --> 00:31:00,102
Two strikes!

523
00:31:01,001 --> 00:31:03,346
[Two strikes]

524
00:31:06,987 --> 00:31:08,241
Hang on, wait.

525
00:31:08,242 --> 00:31:11,239
[At this rate,
Suzy could succeed in one blow?]

526
00:31:11,822 --> 00:31:13,706
Suzy's pretty quick to pick up on things.

527
00:31:14,712 --> 00:31:17,731
[The last coin that stands in her way
of getting three strikes in a row.]

528
00:31:17,732 --> 00:31:19,598
No way.
She's not going to get another one.

529
00:31:19,599 --> 00:31:23,902
[Will she do it?]

530
00:31:32,884 --> 00:31:35,042
[Ball- Ah...]

531
00:31:35,043 --> 00:31:37,454
[Fail]

532
00:31:37,455 --> 00:31:38,676
Okay, you're out.

533
00:31:41,874 --> 00:31:44,229
- Suzy's out.
- He just shoved Suzy out of the way.

534
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:45,787
Suzy is out!

535
00:31:45,788 --> 00:31:49,608
[Suzy's unique reaction to failing.]

536
00:31:51,134 --> 00:31:52,642
Challenge.

537
00:31:53,174 --> 00:31:54,300
Hyun Jin.

538
00:31:57,108 --> 00:31:59,356
[Ever so lightly...
As expected, he gets a strike.]

539
00:32:00,453 --> 00:32:02,717
[He seems to have figured it out?]

540
00:32:02,718 --> 00:32:05,360
- You don't need any psychic powers.
- No, I need at least one.

541
00:32:05,361 --> 00:32:06,822
[Even the monster pitcher is focused
on earning his own psychic powers.]

542
00:32:06,823 --> 00:32:08,230
You're going to get a ball this time.

543
00:32:11,566 --> 00:32:14,036
[Gets the second strike just as lightly.]

544
00:32:20,875 --> 00:32:22,884
- It's over now.
- You're not going to make it.

545
00:32:22,885 --> 00:32:24,495
[Two strikes and no ball.]

546
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:28,780
[The last pitch...]

547
00:32:28,781 --> 00:32:32,211
[As tense and thrilling as any other
games they've seen him play...]

548
00:32:33,855 --> 00:32:35,355
[Ah...]

549
00:32:39,009 --> 00:32:41,627
[Giraffe times it perfectly
to throw off his game.]

550
00:32:43,341 --> 00:32:46,891
[Seriously no more touching
from now on!]

551
00:32:46,892 --> 00:32:48,309
No touching from now on, okay?

552
00:32:49,265 --> 00:32:50,794
- I seriously am not going to do it.
- Jae Suk, okay?

553
00:32:52,627 --> 00:32:54,321
[Next up is Yoo Hyuk.]

554
00:32:54,322 --> 00:32:56,051
- You're all set up to go.
- I'm going to do it fast.

555
00:32:56,394 --> 00:32:58,339
[Three quick pitches in a row
without any pause in between?]

556
00:32:59,043 --> 00:33:01,978
[Did he succeed?]

557
00:33:04,037 --> 00:33:06,139
[One strike]

558
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:08,444
[Two strikes]

559
00:33:09,327 --> 00:33:11,445
[Ball]

560
00:33:15,529 --> 00:33:18,523
[So close to succeeding...]

561
00:33:19,534 --> 00:33:23,797
[He would've succeeded right away
had he flipped over the first one.]

562
00:33:26,263 --> 00:33:27,756
Is this how he did it?

563
00:33:28,123 --> 00:33:30,303
[Suzy's failed reaction.]

564
00:33:32,823 --> 00:33:34,786
Ah, seriously!
I was so close!

565
00:33:37,056 --> 00:33:38,611
- Just do it.
- Challenge.

566
00:33:41,221 --> 00:33:43,363
[Fails right off the bat...]

567
00:33:44,284 --> 00:33:46,809
[Fails from the first pitch.]

568
00:33:48,303 --> 00:33:50,094
You really are bad at this game.

569
00:33:50,636 --> 00:33:52,450
The scientist is about to take his turn.

570
00:33:53,121 --> 00:33:54,700
This is going to take a while,
but please be understanding.

571
00:33:54,701 --> 00:33:56,832
[Teacher Kkuk focusing all his concentration
on the best way to slam down on the book.]

572
00:33:56,833 --> 00:33:58,319
- Hey!
- Challenge.

573
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,731
[Challenge]

574
00:34:02,997 --> 00:34:04,891
[Fail- Ball.]

575
00:34:05,298 --> 00:34:07,124
- That was a good hit.
- No, it wasn't.

576
00:34:09,189 --> 00:34:11,664
No, it was good.
That's how you're supposed to hit.

577
00:34:11,665 --> 00:34:13,267
I'm sure it would've flipped over
if it was a good hit.

578
00:34:16,176 --> 00:34:17,352
Challenge.

579
00:34:17,353 --> 00:34:19,403
Okay, okay, okay!

580
00:34:21,422 --> 00:34:23,673
[One ball]

581
00:34:23,674 --> 00:34:25,569
[Two ball]

582
00:34:25,570 --> 00:34:27,904
[Three balls...]

583
00:34:30,191 --> 00:34:32,598
[None of the coins even budged...]

584
00:34:32,599 --> 00:34:34,921
[Okay, three balls.]

585
00:34:37,017 --> 00:34:39,693
[Automatically breaking out
in Suzy's failed reaction.]

586
00:34:39,694 --> 00:34:40,704
Okay, my turn.

587
00:34:41,287 --> 00:34:43,134
We don't have much time, Kwang Soo.
You need to hurry.

588
00:34:43,495 --> 00:34:46,257
[Prank No. 256- Rush Kwang Soo.]

589
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:50,207
[Kwang Soo feeling rushed all of a sudden.]

590
00:34:51,507 --> 00:34:53,041
- Challenge!
- One, two, three.

591
00:34:53,972 --> 00:34:56,408
[Fail...]

592
00:34:57,030 --> 00:34:59,132
[Fails immediately from the first pitch.]

593
00:34:59,133 --> 00:35:01,000
Why do you keep doing this to me?

594
00:35:01,365 --> 00:35:03,952
Why are you suddenly doing
a countdown with me?

595
00:35:05,949 --> 00:35:07,439
- We have to hurry.
- Challenge.

596
00:35:10,891 --> 00:35:12,572
[What?]

597
00:35:21,170 --> 00:35:22,439
[After getting his two strikes...]

598
00:35:22,439 --> 00:35:25,680
[He covers up the third coin with
his hand.]

599
00:35:25,681 --> 00:35:29,114
[Covered up the coin from
having missed his mark.]

600
00:35:29,115 --> 00:35:31,524
Can you let me do this one again?
I accidentally covered it up with my hand!

601
00:35:34,042 --> 00:35:35,653
What have I done!

602
00:35:35,654 --> 00:35:37,223
[Pissed off.]

603
00:35:39,131 --> 00:35:41,087
I hit the last coin with my hand.

604
00:35:41,629 --> 00:35:43,879
[Back to Yoo Hyuk's turn.]

605
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:46,882
- We're really short on time right now.
- You know me. I'm going for it.

606
00:35:52,204 --> 00:35:54,822
[Rolls over and over...]

607
00:35:54,823 --> 00:35:58,538
[Strike]

608
00:36:00,007 --> 00:36:01,172
That was a strike.

609
00:36:04,742 --> 00:36:07,088
[Two strikes]

610
00:36:07,879 --> 00:36:09,440
Are you going to play dirty like this?

611
00:36:09,441 --> 00:36:12,225
- You're playing dirty.
- You have to play fair and by the rules.

612
00:36:15,822 --> 00:36:17,701
[What will come of this turn?]

613
00:36:18,344 --> 00:36:20,912
[Three strikes]

614
00:36:22,477 --> 00:36:25,041
[Strikeout]

615
00:36:25,873 --> 00:36:28,885
[A dirty play...
but still managed to strikeout.]

616
00:36:31,397 --> 00:36:36,035
[Three strike, strikeouts- Jae Suk wins.]

617
00:36:36,702 --> 00:36:39,586
[Yoo Hyuk is the winner of the
book strikeout game.]

618
00:36:39,587 --> 00:36:42,660
[Earns himself psychic power money.]

619
00:36:50,216 --> 00:36:54,135
[Welcome to psychic baseball field.]

620
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:56,320
[Players entering the field.]

621
00:36:58,071 --> 00:36:59,144
[Running Man's Jae Suk]

622
00:37:01,906 --> 00:37:04,792
[Running Man- Jae Suk]

623
00:37:06,729 --> 00:37:10,248
[Hitter with a big heart-
Baseball manic, Yoo Hyuk.]

624
00:37:12,296 --> 00:37:14,265
[Running Man's Jong Kook]

625
00:37:14,522 --> 00:37:18,745
[All the players enter
the field with confidence.]

626
00:37:20,326 --> 00:37:23,010
[Hm...]

627
00:37:26,319 --> 00:37:28,426
[A cheerful greeting to an empty stadium.]

628
00:37:30,148 --> 00:37:31,444
[And...]

629
00:37:34,335 --> 00:37:38,970
[Ryu Hyun Jin with Running Man.]

630
00:37:39,345 --> 00:37:44,573
[The captain of Running Man's psychic
baseball team, Ryu Hyun Jin's entrance.]

631
00:37:46,516 --> 00:37:48,071
Look at him run.

632
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:54,602
[Running head on towards his
rightful place on the mound.]

633
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,002
I didn't know you could run that fast.

634
00:37:57,653 --> 00:38:00,406
I can't believe that you were able to make it
here with your busy schedule.

635
00:38:00,407 --> 00:38:01,571
[And today's special umpire.]

636
00:38:01,572 --> 00:38:04,780
Today's event makes anything
in this world possible.

637
00:38:05,881 --> 00:38:07,713
Please allow me to introduce myself.
My name is Huh Joon.

638
00:38:10,553 --> 00:38:11,816
The truth of the matter is

639
00:38:11,817 --> 00:38:14,569
it's impossible to play a game of baseball
with the number of players you have here.

640
00:38:14,570 --> 00:38:19,112
That's why there are some special guests who
have come on the show to join you today.

641
00:38:19,113 --> 00:38:23,876
[There are more players that will
be joining the psychic baseball game?]

642
00:38:25,650 --> 00:38:26,702
Where are they?

643
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:28,880
[Who could it be?]

644
00:38:29,744 --> 00:38:34,546
[First additional player enters the field.]

645
00:38:34,547 --> 00:38:37,352
[How can this be?]

646
00:38:37,404 --> 00:38:39,231
Isn't that Lee Byung Kyu?

647
00:38:41,643 --> 00:38:43,408
[He's here!]

648
00:38:43,409 --> 00:38:48,718
[The king of all hitters,
the pillar of strength for Team LG Twins.]

649
00:38:54,508 --> 00:38:57,014
[Lee Byung Kyu with Running Man.]

650
00:38:57,015 --> 00:38:59,187
Byung Kyu!

651
00:38:59,188 --> 00:39:05,932
[The indestructible player, Lee Byung Kyu.]

652
00:39:05,933 --> 00:39:07,230
Awesome!

653
00:39:07,231 --> 00:39:09,052
- Byung Kyu!
- Hello, Jae Suk.

654
00:39:10,672 --> 00:39:13,489
- It's been so long!
- I haven't seen you in ten years.

655
00:39:14,797 --> 00:39:17,110
[He and Jae Suk are friends?]

656
00:39:17,111 --> 00:39:18,618
- Jae Suk, you know him?
- Of course!

657
00:39:19,528 --> 00:39:21,804
[Junior Hyun Jin takes off his hat
the moment Lee Byung Kyu enters the field.]

658
00:39:21,805 --> 00:39:23,326
Hello, Byung Kyu.

659
00:39:24,984 --> 00:39:27,479
- I can't believe you're here!
- I'm a huge fan of yours!

660
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:30,279
[A formal 90 degree bow in greeting.]

661
00:39:30,776 --> 00:39:32,434
[Just then]

662
00:39:33,104 --> 00:39:35,656
[Someone else is entering the field!]

663
00:39:37,883 --> 00:39:40,490
[The machine who never misses his hit!]

664
00:39:40,491 --> 00:39:44,060
[Top hitter, Kim Hyun Soo who ever constantly
shocks his fans with his skills!]

665
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:52,428
[Kim Hyun Soo with Running Man.]

666
00:39:56,898 --> 00:39:58,210
Why are you here?

667
00:39:58,959 --> 00:40:02,482
[Totally starstruck-
The hearts of Korean baseball are all here!]

668
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:05,728
- Who is it?
- Who is it this time?

669
00:40:05,729 --> 00:40:08,487
[Hyun Jin and Kim Hyun Soo are friends
who are of the same age.]

670
00:40:09,209 --> 00:40:11,743
[And last but not least...]

671
00:40:12,981 --> 00:40:14,709
Isn't that Shin Kyung Hyun?

672
00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:16,483
[The man who made everything possible
for Ryu Hyun Jin, Shin Kyung Hyun.]

673
00:40:17,042 --> 00:40:19,375
[My mentor...]

674
00:40:20,411 --> 00:40:22,438
[Having been by Ryu Hyun Jin's side
as they took home 81 victories together.]

675
00:40:22,439 --> 00:40:26,835
[Ryu Hyun Jin-Shin Kyung Hyun duo
that broke Korea's pro baseball history.]

676
00:40:32,857 --> 00:40:35,707
[Shin Kyung Hyun with Running Man.]

677
00:40:36,217 --> 00:40:40,976
[Having retired back in September,
he is now the coach for Hanwha Eagles.]

678
00:40:42,937 --> 00:40:45,890
[Sir, you came...]

679
00:40:48,102 --> 00:40:49,864
['I just threw the ball however my mentor,
Shin Kyung Hyun told me to throw'.]

680
00:40:49,865 --> 00:40:52,557
[A quote from Ryu Hyun Jin
during one of his interviews.]

681
00:40:54,115 --> 00:40:56,381
We're not playing with magic?
Isn't that what we were doing?

682
00:40:56,739 --> 00:41:00,173
[They're going to play the game with
the famed legends of Korea's pro baseball?]

683
00:41:00,174 --> 00:41:01,551
Are you all here to play baseball?

684
00:41:01,552 --> 00:41:04,294
You expect us to play baseball with them?

685
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:07,510
- How are we going to play against them?
- How about a round of introductions first?

686
00:41:07,511 --> 00:41:09,779
[Time to calm down for now,
and do a round of formal introductions.]

687
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:12,561
First is, Lee Byung Kyu from LG Twins.

688
00:41:14,323 --> 00:41:16,105
Hello, my name is Lee Byung Kyu
of the LG Twins.

689
00:41:16,741 --> 00:41:19,485
I feel honored to be a guest
on Running Man today.

690
00:41:19,765 --> 00:41:21,753
I will do whatever I can to play my best.

691
00:41:22,075 --> 00:41:23,993
<i>[We're the ones who feel honored.]</i>

692
00:41:23,994 --> 00:41:26,183
- He and I are very...
- What now?

693
00:41:26,184 --> 00:41:29,182
He and I used to hit up all the nightclubs
together back in the day.

694
00:41:30,267 --> 00:41:31,695
You're such a liar.

695
00:41:32,057 --> 00:41:34,824
[He used to hang out with Jae Suk?]

696
00:41:36,105 --> 00:41:38,495
Well... we mostly...

697
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:41,511
About three to four times a week?

698
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:46,829
[Matching wit for wit, and joke for a joke.]

699
00:41:47,867 --> 00:41:50,232
[They're curious to know Jae Suk's
success rate with all the women?]

700
00:41:50,233 --> 00:41:53,749
[Zero success rate.]

701
00:41:54,417 --> 00:41:56,095
And next to him is...

702
00:41:56,096 --> 00:41:59,200
He is the coach for Hanwha Eagles.
Welcome Shin Kyung Hyun.

703
00:41:59,201 --> 00:42:02,111
[Coach Shin Kyung Hyun of the
Hanwha Eagles.]

704
00:42:02,112 --> 00:42:05,531
You caught Ryu Hyun Jin's first ball
when he first started out, right?

705
00:42:05,532 --> 00:42:06,984
- Really?
- His first ball?

706
00:42:06,985 --> 00:42:08,492
[Catcher Shin Kyung Hyun, having caught
Hyun Jin's first ball at his debut game.]

707
00:42:08,493 --> 00:42:11,466
We even used to be roommates when
Hyun Jin first started out in his career.

708
00:42:11,467 --> 00:42:13,308
- I see.
- You two were roommates?

709
00:42:13,309 --> 00:42:16,022
I used to make Hyun Jin do a lot
of my chores and errands.

710
00:42:16,023 --> 00:42:17,671
[Hyun Jin used to be his errand boy.]

711
00:42:19,225 --> 00:42:21,453
<i>[Sorry about all that back then, Hyun Jin.]</i>

712
00:42:21,454 --> 00:42:23,471
And standing next to him...
You and Ryu Hyun Jin are friends?

713
00:42:23,472 --> 00:42:28,548
- You two are friends?
- Please welcome, Kim Hyun Soo.

714
00:42:28,549 --> 00:42:30,543
You went to the same school as I did,
didn't you, Hyun Soo?

715
00:42:30,544 --> 00:42:33,226
- Why are you talking in casual tone?
- He's my high school junior.

716
00:42:33,227 --> 00:42:35,188
- Seriously?
- But this is your first time meeting him.

717
00:42:35,189 --> 00:42:37,595
- Did you see him while you were in school?
- Of course not.

718
00:42:37,596 --> 00:42:40,197
- Then why are you speaking to him like that?
- He's here as our guest.

719
00:42:40,198 --> 00:42:43,207
- You should speak to him more formally.
- Did you know that Suk Jin was your senior?

720
00:42:43,208 --> 00:42:45,824
- Yes, the teachers at school mentioned him.
- What? What are they saying about me?

721
00:42:45,825 --> 00:42:47,321
What did the teachers say about him?

722
00:42:47,322 --> 00:42:49,938
That he wasn't good at anything in school,
but he became successful on TV.

723
00:42:55,255 --> 00:42:58,515
But I bet this is the first time for any
of you playing psychic baseball.

724
00:42:58,516 --> 00:43:00,930
- You're going to feel very flustered by it.
- Have any of you seen the game being played?

725
00:43:00,930 --> 00:43:02,368
- Yes, I have seen it.
- You've seen us play?

726
00:43:02,368 --> 00:43:04,873
- Yes, we have seen it.
- How are we going to divide up the teams?

727
00:43:05,458 --> 00:43:07,743
<i>It's going to be Team Yoo Jae Suk
vs. Team Ryu Hyun Jin.</i>

728
00:43:07,744 --> 00:43:09,904
- Those are going to be the two teams.
- I want to be on Hyun Jin's team.

729
00:43:09,905 --> 00:43:12,351
Why does it have to be me
against Hyun Jin?

730
00:43:12,352 --> 00:43:15,148
- Why do I have to play against him?
- You're not going to be on his team!

731
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:19,473
[Everyone is hoping to be on
Hyun Jin's team.]

732
00:43:19,474 --> 00:43:22,029
It's very simple. Play rock paper scissors,
and the winner gets to choose first.

733
00:43:22,030 --> 00:43:25,235
And then the loser gets to pick next until
all the players have been chosen.

734
00:43:25,752 --> 00:43:26,903
Rock paper scissors.

735
00:43:26,904 --> 00:43:29,043
Rock paper scissors.
Rock paper scissors.

736
00:43:29,341 --> 00:43:31,289
[Jae Suk wins.]

737
00:43:31,290 --> 00:43:33,550
[Everyone's avoiding meeting his gaze.]

738
00:43:34,083 --> 00:43:36,084
You're all turning your backs on me?

739
00:43:37,445 --> 00:43:39,205
Byung Kyu!

740
00:43:39,206 --> 00:43:43,610
[Jae Suk chooses Lee Byung Kyu.]

741
00:43:43,611 --> 00:43:44,923
- It's all over now.
- His team seems much better now.

742
00:43:46,241 --> 00:43:49,799
[Hyun Jin chooses Coach Shin Kyung Hyun.]

743
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:51,419
He still has respect for his mentor.

744
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:54,377
Okay, rock paper scissors.

745
00:43:54,378 --> 00:43:56,264
Rock paper scissors!

746
00:43:58,659 --> 00:44:02,672
But... since you already have two
professional players on your team...

747
00:44:02,673 --> 00:44:05,935
- Can you give him to us?
- I'm not picking Hyun Soo. I want Suzy.

748
00:44:09,244 --> 00:44:13,845
[A total shocker!
He picks Suzy over Kim Hyun Soo!]

749
00:44:14,452 --> 00:44:16,304
You're here to play baseball, not to date!

750
00:44:17,649 --> 00:44:19,271
I can't believe you chose Suzy
over him!

751
00:44:19,272 --> 00:44:20,967
I choose Kim Hyun Soo!

752
00:44:20,968 --> 00:44:24,514
[What luck!
Jae Suk chooses Kim Hyun Soo.]

753
00:44:24,515 --> 00:44:26,215
- This game is all over now.
- Okay, the game just got evened out.

754
00:44:26,216 --> 00:44:28,201
With these two players on my team?
It's all over now.

755
00:44:28,202 --> 00:44:31,163
Okay, it's now time to pick from
all the minions over there.

756
00:44:33,743 --> 00:44:36,454
[Now the selection is slim pickings.]

757
00:44:37,559 --> 00:44:39,044
Rock paper scissors.

758
00:44:40,916 --> 00:44:42,823
- Gary.
- Gary? Me?

759
00:44:43,479 --> 00:44:46,041
[Team Hyun Jin picks
Mr. Random Capable, Gary.]

760
00:44:46,042 --> 00:44:48,115
He knows what's up!

761
00:44:48,116 --> 00:44:49,318
Ji Hyo!

762
00:44:49,319 --> 00:44:52,860
[Jae Suk selects Blank Ji who has
a lot of money to buy psychic powers.]

763
00:44:52,861 --> 00:44:54,558
How do you feel now, Ji Hyo?

764
00:44:54,559 --> 00:44:55,826
Rock paper scissors.

765
00:44:59,493 --> 00:45:01,065
Okay, Jong Kook.
Come here.

766
00:45:05,049 --> 00:45:07,556
- I'm fast. I'm super-fast!
- Pick me.

767
00:45:07,557 --> 00:45:09,644
[And the familiar three amigos.]

768
00:45:09,645 --> 00:45:11,472
I'm not even kidding around right now.

769
00:45:11,473 --> 00:45:13,780
You can't pick Kwang Soo.
Please don't pick Kwang Soo.

770
00:45:13,781 --> 00:45:15,756
- Why?
- Definitely not him. I've seen him play.

771
00:45:16,660 --> 00:45:19,757
[Kim Hyun Soo saw
last year's psychic baseball game.]

772
00:45:19,758 --> 00:45:21,784
- No Kwang Soo for you either?
- I really am good!

773
00:45:21,785 --> 00:45:24,197
- You don't know how to play.
- Hyun Soo doesn't want you.

774
00:45:24,198 --> 00:45:25,721
Why not me?

775
00:45:27,455 --> 00:45:29,237
- Ha Ha!
- That's right!

776
00:45:29,238 --> 00:45:31,382
[Team Jae Suk recruits Ha Ha.]

777
00:45:31,870 --> 00:45:33,848
We have the psychic powers.
We'll win with our psychic powers.

778
00:45:33,849 --> 00:45:36,052
- Seriously?
- I seriously can't believe this.

779
00:45:37,349 --> 00:45:39,669
Rock paper scissors.
Rock paper scissors.

780
00:45:40,248 --> 00:45:42,698
This is a really tough decision.
We're going to have a team huddle.

781
00:45:44,020 --> 00:45:46,209
I watched your last year's
game very closely.

782
00:45:46,210 --> 00:45:49,031
- But Kwang Soo really can't be on our team.
- You think Suk Jin's better?

783
00:45:49,032 --> 00:45:50,033
[But it's not like Big-nose
is that much better...]

784
00:45:52,411 --> 00:45:56,755
[These two with an astonishing
level of low talent for the game.]

785
00:45:57,786 --> 00:46:00,380
[Not much difference there.
It truly is a tough decision.]

786
00:46:00,381 --> 00:46:02,794
I noticed how Kwang Soo kept getting angry,
and lashed out at everyone.

787
00:46:02,795 --> 00:46:05,168
I'm not going to get angry.
I'm not going to do that anymore.

788
00:46:05,169 --> 00:46:07,726
That's when I used to be immature.
I'm not going to do that anymore.

789
00:46:07,727 --> 00:46:09,772
[The meeting is now over.]

790
00:46:11,475 --> 00:46:13,542
Senior.

791
00:46:13,543 --> 00:46:15,704
- Okay!
- Join the other team.

792
00:46:17,861 --> 00:46:21,319
[Choosing temper tantrum prone Giraffe
over physically weak Impala.]

793
00:46:26,052 --> 00:46:29,154
[Team Ryu Hyun Jin vs. Team Yoo Jae Suk-
Team selection complete.]

794
00:46:29,155 --> 00:46:31,780
<i>I'll explain the simple rules
of the game to you.</i>

795
00:46:31,781 --> 00:46:35,622
<i>The bottles that you see hanging there
will be your psychic powers.</i>

796
00:46:35,623 --> 00:46:37,262
[It is time to shop for their
psychic powers.]

797
00:46:38,185 --> 00:46:41,979
[Names of the psychic powers
that are up for purchase.]

798
00:46:44,669 --> 00:46:48,054
You have to recite a magic spell
before you can use your psychic powers.

799
00:46:48,055 --> 00:46:50,665
- You can't be embarrassed about it.
- It'll be tough if you get embarrassed by it.

800
00:46:50,666 --> 00:46:52,542
Jae Suk's very good at it.
Want to see him demonstrate?

801
00:46:52,543 --> 00:46:55,496
The one who controls space!

802
00:46:55,497 --> 00:46:57,334
That's how you recite the spell.

803
00:46:58,424 --> 00:47:01,057
Did you see how amazed they were?

804
00:47:02,165 --> 00:47:05,010
You'll regret it later on while watching the
broadcast of the show if you get timid.

805
00:47:05,011 --> 00:47:07,557
You'll wish that you were more
enthusiastic about it.

806
00:47:07,558 --> 00:47:08,681
[Byung Kyu seems to show great interest.]

807
00:47:16,823 --> 00:47:19,347
What's happening to me?
I feel it coursing through my body!

808
00:47:21,982 --> 00:47:23,435
This is how you do it.

809
00:47:27,306 --> 00:47:28,799
Roll-roll!

810
00:47:30,478 --> 00:47:33,710
[Screams and shouts heard
from everywhere.]

811
00:47:35,395 --> 00:47:37,257
You have to do it too, Byung Kyu.

812
00:47:37,930 --> 00:47:40,129
Stop the ball!

813
00:47:41,599 --> 00:47:44,455
I can see your body glowing.
The psychic power is within you.

814
00:47:44,456 --> 00:47:46,002
Look at that.

815
00:47:46,003 --> 00:47:47,992
We can see your body shaking.

816
00:47:50,028 --> 00:47:54,237
[Will Suzy be able to pull it off?]

817
00:47:56,585 --> 00:47:58,210
- That's how you do it?
- You're doing great.

818
00:48:00,734 --> 00:48:02,480
Are you okay?
Do you feel anything different?

819
00:48:02,481 --> 00:48:04,286
Ugh, I feel weird.

820
00:48:07,003 --> 00:48:08,346
It tastes good.

821
00:48:09,869 --> 00:48:12,364
The one who controls the bases!

822
00:48:17,156 --> 00:48:19,049
He's absorbing the power!

823
00:48:22,359 --> 00:48:25,645
[Competitive energy felt
from both team's dugouts.]

824
00:48:25,646 --> 00:48:27,460
Hefty Ryu!
Fighting!

825
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:34,125
[Psychic baseball game starts now.]

826
00:48:35,368 --> 00:48:36,608
Ji Hyo!

827
00:48:36,609 --> 00:48:38,229
You're on the defense, Ji Hyo.

828
00:48:39,783 --> 00:48:41,793
- Where are you going?
- Get your head on straight!

829
00:48:42,385 --> 00:48:45,855
[Blank Ji following the opposing team to
play defense when her team's the offense.]

830
00:48:45,856 --> 00:48:49,213
- I was just following them out.
- Start of the game is most important.

831

- Fighting!
- Play ball!

837
00:49:21,463 --> 00:49:24,955
- Kim Hyun Soo!
- Kim Hyun Soo!

838
00:49:24,956 --> 00:49:27,578
- It's Kim Hyun Soo.
- We have to stay alert.

839
00:49:27,579 --> 00:49:29,373
[All the opposing team's players
are feeling the pressure.]

840
00:49:29,374 --> 00:49:31,172
We'll show you how it's really done.

841
00:49:31,173 --> 00:49:32,970
[Preparing themselves for the hit
by spreading out their defense.]

842
00:49:32,971 --> 00:49:34,925
This is making me nervous!

843
00:49:36,697 --> 00:49:41,462
[Monster vs. Batting Machine.]

844
00:49:43,533 --> 00:49:49,147
[Even though they've faced each other
countless number of times in pro baseball...]

845
00:49:49,148 --> 00:49:53,277
[The competition between the two players
has always remained a very close call.]

846
00:49:54,718 --> 00:49:58,537
[Let's determine who the better player is
in psychic baseball today!]

847
00:50:00,332 --> 00:50:05,146
[What will become of the first match
between the Monster and Batting Machine?]

848
00:50:10,344 --> 00:50:12,190
[Foul]

00:50:15,937 --> 00:50:18,728
[Kim Hyun Soo moving over
to the other side of the base.]

850

[Hyung Soo, who was hit by the ball
can only laugh at the sight.]

854
00:50:45,837 --> 00:50:48,260
[Angered teammates.]

855
00:50:49,471 --> 00:50:52,184
[Both teams are fired up
from the very first pitch.]

856
00:50:57,740 --> 00:50:59,365
Go back out that way.

857
00:51:00,154 --> 00:51:02,562
Seriously... they're out to get us.

858
00:51:02,563 --> 00:51:05,104
Hey, I didn't hit you on purpose.

859
00:51:06,331 --> 00:51:08,942
Why does it hurt so badly
if you didn't do it on purpose?

860
00:51:09,852 --> 00:51:12,040
Why are you going to first base
instead of batting again?

861
00:51:12,041 --> 00:51:14,096
- Why is he going there instead of hitting?
- Who?

862
00:51:14,097 --> 00:51:17,037
[Suzy... doesn't know much
about baseball.]

863

when he didn't even hit the ball.

864
00:51:20,632 --> 00:51:23,913
Suzy just asked me why he went to first base
when he didn't even hit the ball.

865
00:51:24,035 --> 00:51:28,162
When a batter gets hit by the ball,
he just gets to walk to first base.

866
00:51:28,481 --> 00:51:30,503
[Ah... I see.]

- It's a ball.
- Good job. You're doing good!

871
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:43,391

and throws it over to first base.]

- No, it's okay.
- I just hit a ball that Ryu Hyun Jin pitched!

876
00:52:04,754 --> 00:52:06,906
Why doesn't Kyung Hyun switch spots
since we're in a bit of trouble?

877
00:52:06,907 --> 00:52:09,674
[Proposing a swap of position with
the opposing team on the bases?]

878
00:52:09,675 --> 00:52:12,448

[Nice hit!]

884
00:52:37,239 --> 00:52:40,016
[Too difficult of a ball to catch
for Big-nosed Brother.]

885
00:52:40,017 --> 00:52:41,439
You have to catch it!

[First batter, Hyun Soo makes it
safely across the home plate.]

887
00:52:47,173 --> 00:52:50,131
[Ha Ha's successful hit.]

888
00:52:50,132 --> 00:52:52,142
What are you doing?
Why couldn't you catch that ball?

889
00:52:52,143 --> 00:52:56,903

making the flames burn even hotter instead.]

893
00:53:17,224 --> 00:53:20,437
[Plan is to avoid a possible homerun
by hitting this batter with the ball too?]

894
00:53:21,667 --> 00:53:24,370
You can't even hit him with the ball?

895
00:53:26,767 --> 00:53:28,849
Why aren't you getting hit?
Just let the ball hit you.

896
00:53:33,950 --> 00:53:36,916
[Are they playing baseball... or dodge ball?]

897
00:53:37,714 --> 00:53:39,212

[Sends Lee Byung Kyu off to first base by
throwing four intentional balls.]

899
00:53:47,286 --> 00:53:49,887
- Then what use is it to have a strong hitter?
- We need to strategize.

900
00:53:49,888 --> 00:53:51,960
What's the use of even having
a strong hitter on our team then?

901
00:53:51,961 --> 00:53:53,889
- You can't throw four balls like that.
- We need to talk about this.

902
00:53:53,890 --> 00:53:55,765
- Jae Suk!
- Seriously.

903
00:53:56,280 --> 00:53:58,521
- Good job!
- Is our team winning?

904
00:53:59,664 --> 00:54:02,335

You can go in now.

916
00:54:48,882 --> 00:54:50,312
You can give me the glove.

917
00:54:50,313 --> 00:54:52,205
You have to go hit the ball now.

918
00:54:53,685 --> 00:54:54,980

[Just what in the world
happened just now?]

931
00:55:41,122 --> 00:55:44,844
- How can you get hit by your own ball?
- I've never seen that happen before.

932
00:55:44,845 --> 00:55:47,404
If you get hit by the ball that you just
hit yourself, then you're out.

933
00:55:47,405 --> 00:55:50,172
If the batter gets hit by his own ball,
then he's out of the game.

934
00:55:50,173 --> 00:55:52,603
- Really?
- But not if you get hit while still at base.

935
00:55:52,604 --> 00:55:55,029
But you're out if you get hit
once you're away from the home plate.

936
00:55:55,029 --> 00:55:57,048
[It's okay...
it was a homerun of entertainment.]

[Kim Hyun Soo's face breaking out in a smile
as soon as Suzy steps up to plate.]

941

with it, Suzy?

[Suzy getting ambitious and greedy for a
big hit with it being her first time to bat.]

943
00:56:20,370 --> 00:56:22,772

Hold onto the bat a bit tighter.

944
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:29,354
[She really shouldn't be doing that...]

945
00:56:29,355 --> 00:56:31,611
Go out there and give her a tip, Hyun Jin.

946
00:56:31,612 --> 00:56:35,012
Go out there and show her how it's done.
This is your chance!

947
00:56:35,013 --> 00:56:37,772

[I'm so... jealous.]

951
00:56:53,017 --> 00:56:54,837
And you have to run to first base
if you hit the ball.

952
00:56:54,838 --> 00:56:56,638
[Team Hyun Jin's tip- Hit the ball and run.]

953
00:56:56,639 --> 00:56:58,319
You have to run this way.
Run over to that spot.

954
00:57:06,366 --> 00:57:07,714
No, no, no.

955
00:57:07,715 --> 00:57:10,826
[That was a foul...]

956
00:57:11,556 --> 00:57:13,262
You have to drop the bat
before you run.

957

[As mentioned,
this is her first time playing baseball.]

958

[Giraffe coming in to
relieve the first pitcher.]

959
00:57:21,232 --> 00:57:23,752

- Hit the ball, Suzy.

960
00:57:23,753 --> 00:57:25,394
Use it now, Suzy.

961
00:57:26,017 --> 00:57:27,603
[Yeah... now's the time.]

962
00:57:27,604 --> 00:57:30,492
The one...

963

[Wow! Suzy hits the ball
and makes it to first base!]

973
00:58:48,359 --> 00:58:50,093

991
01:00:06,947 --> 01:00:09,647
Cease the ball!

- Take a look.

995
01:00:22,554 --> 01:00:24,243
[What kind of a power is this?]

996
01:00:27,093 --> 01:00:30,453
[Pitching the ball with all his might...]

997
01:00:31,747 --> 01:00:33,309
You have to say it.

998
01:00:33,310 --> 01:00:34,534
Stop, stop!

999
01:00:34,535 --> 01:00:35,841
Stop!

1000
01:00:35,842 --> 01:00:38,287
[The ball... stopped moving?]

1001
01:00:39,941 --> 01:00:42,275
[The truth is,
the ball flew in out of somewhere...]

1002
01:00:42,276 --> 01:00:45,013
[And the ball stopped just where
Coach Shin wanted it to stop.]

1003
01:00:45,445 --> 01:00:48,600
[Team Jae Suk in an extreme state
of bewilderment.]

1004
01:00:49,604 --> 01:00:51,765
[He's known for even hitting a ball
that's being pitched at 150 km an hour.]

1005
01:00:51,766 --> 01:00:54,517
[If it's a ball that just stands in place...]

1006
01:00:55,637 --> 01:00:57,518
Just run as fast as you can
as soon as he hits the ball.

1007
01:00:59,112 --> 01:01:02,357
[The ball must be stopped!]

1008
01:01:04,434 --> 01:01:06,813
[Foul!]

1009
01:01:11,540 --> 01:01:14,313
[Over ecstatic Team Jae Suk.]

1010
01:01:15,231 --> 01:01:19,476
You can no longer cease the ball
during this inning.

1011
01:01:19,477 --> 01:01:22,642
[Team Hyun Jin lost their
crucial chance at winning.]

1012
01:01:23,879 --> 01:01:25,736
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1013
01:01:29,224 --> 01:01:32,803
- Are these just look-alikes here?
- What's going on here?

1014
01:01:32,804 --> 01:01:33,881
[Just stand-ins that looks like
the real players?]

1015
01:01:33,882 --> 01:01:38,241
[Even the real players are nervous
at playing psychic baseball.]

1016
01:01:44,713 --> 01:01:47,127
[Immediately flies off the handle to attack.]

1017
01:01:47,911 --> 01:01:51,364
[Even the slightest bodily contact
results in bench clearing.]

1018
01:01:52,832 --> 01:01:55,794
[Even this is a show of their teamwork.]

1019
01:01:58,920 --> 01:02:02,893
[The psychic power was used needlessly
since they still got to score a point.]

1020
01:02:02,894 --> 01:02:05,880
- What happened back there?
- The ball was all mangled.

1021
01:02:05,881 --> 01:02:08,770
How could the ball be mangled?
It was a perfectly round ball.

1022
01:02:10,972 --> 01:02:16,044
[Team Jae Suk is at two outs,
and Byung Kyu comes up to bat.]

1023
01:02:16,045 --> 01:02:18,142
Okay, this is good.

1024
01:02:18,675 --> 01:02:21,609
- We could've had a chance.
- I'll do it.

1025
01:02:21,610 --> 01:02:23,058
Switch out the pitcher.

1026
01:02:23,482 --> 01:02:27,585
[Huh? Big-nosed Brother to pitch
for the Batting King?]

1027
01:02:30,725 --> 01:02:31,775
Play ball!

1028
01:02:32,462 --> 01:02:36,434
[Will Batting King, Byung Kyu be able to
save his team from two outs?]

1029
01:02:36,435 --> 01:02:39,895
[But just then...]

1030
01:02:40,597 --> 01:02:43,252
The controller of darkness!

1031
01:02:44,135 --> 01:02:46,534
The controller of darkness!

1032
01:02:46,535 --> 01:02:49,449
[Activates his darkness spell.]

1033
01:02:50,022 --> 01:02:53,398
[What could it be?]

1034
01:02:56,943 --> 01:02:59,510
[Here's your adorable blindfold.]

1035
01:03:05,068 --> 01:03:07,024
That's going overboard!

1036
01:03:07,025 --> 01:03:10,070
He should still be able to hit if he's
played baseball all his life.

1037
01:03:10,591 --> 01:03:12,410
[Batting King suddenly transformed into
the epitome of cuteness.]

1038
01:03:12,411 --> 01:03:14,651
- You can still do this.
- Okay.

1039
01:03:14,652 --> 01:03:17,019
Suk Jin may not be able to throw a strike.

1040
01:03:17,020 --> 01:03:19,875
- You can still hit it.
- Throw the ball on a count of three.

1041
01:03:19,876 --> 01:03:22,805
One, two, three.

1042
01:03:22,806 --> 01:03:24,231
Wait for it!

1043
01:03:24,232 --> 01:03:25,746
- Wait for it!
- Swing!

1044
01:03:26,344 --> 01:03:27,949
- Wait for it!
- Swing!

1045
01:03:29,054 --> 01:03:31,603
[The ball hits his knee.]

1046
01:03:35,124 --> 01:03:38,541
[Uses his psychic power only to
hit him on the knee.]

1047
01:03:39,485 --> 01:03:42,663
[How could this be?]

1048
01:03:43,832 --> 01:03:46,680
[Turning into a big crybaby.]

1049
01:03:48,502 --> 01:03:51,968
[Making him walk to first base by hitting
his knee after calling upon the darkness.]

1050
01:03:55,579 --> 01:03:57,684
Okay, let's use our powers too.

1051
01:03:57,685 --> 01:04:02,124
- Okay, let's use it.
- Calling upon the power of Roll-Roll!

1052
01:04:02,125 --> 01:04:05,332
Roll out the special defense!

1053
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:08,550
- Roll Roll!
- What's that?

1054
01:04:08,551 --> 01:04:10,376
- Roll Roll!
- That's too much!

1055
01:04:13,610 --> 01:04:18,686
[It's the little league!]

1056
01:04:20,201 --> 01:04:24,456
[Strong little league defense team
coming onto the field endlessly.]

1057
01:04:26,568 --> 01:04:28,294
How many of them are there?

1058
01:04:28,295 --> 01:04:30,103
Come on, guys!

1059
01:04:31,064 --> 01:04:32,287
What the heck is this?

1060
01:04:33,333 --> 01:04:35,038
You're so cute.

1061
01:04:35,039 --> 01:04:38,304
- Don't you think that this is too much?
- How many of them are there?

1062
01:04:39,320 --> 01:04:43,796
[Absolutely adorable
Namyang Little Leagues Team.]

1063
01:04:45,033 --> 01:04:49,226
[The most adorable Roll-Roll to date.]

1064
01:04:49,227 --> 01:04:52,102
- Hi guys!
- The Roll Rolls are way too cute!

1065
01:04:52,593 --> 01:04:56,137
- I don't see any empty spots.
- Fighting!

1066
01:04:56,138 --> 01:04:58,589
- Fighting!
- This is good.

1067
01:05:11,488 --> 01:05:14,099
[Nice catch!]

1068
01:05:14,100 --> 01:05:18,105
[Three outs- Time to switch.]

1069
01:05:20,890 --> 01:05:23,720
- Seriously!
- Don't you think that's going overboard?

1070
01:05:24,272 --> 01:05:26,469
Don't you think that was going
way too overboard?

1071
01:05:26,470 --> 01:05:29,214
- Roll Roll!
- Roll Roll!

1072
01:05:31,536 --> 01:05:35,015
[The formidable wall of defense dissipates
as soon as their job is done.]

1073
01:05:35,016 --> 01:05:36,797
Thanks, you guys!

1074
01:05:37,383 --> 01:05:45,135
[Thank you to Namyang Little League Team
for coming out to help in this cold weather.]

1075
01:05:45,480 --> 01:05:46,901
[Running Man Series- Second Inning.]

1076
01:05:47,294 --> 01:05:51,811
[Gary on first base with Kkuk on third base.]

1077
01:05:51,812 --> 01:05:53,259
We're going to switch out the pitcher.

1078
01:05:53,260 --> 01:05:55,441
[Team Jae Suk switches out their pitcher.]

1079
01:05:55,442 --> 01:05:58,259
[Ha Ha walks up to the mound
with his weapon in hand.]

1080
01:05:58,260 --> 01:06:00,213
It's the legendary pitcher!

1081
01:06:02,396 --> 01:06:05,109
[How have you been, my friend?]

1082
01:06:05,110 --> 01:06:07,769
[So we meet again...]

1083
01:06:08,891 --> 01:06:11,112
[About this time last year...]

1084
01:06:11,113 --> 01:06:13,602
[Their first face-off.]

1085
01:06:13,603 --> 01:06:17,783
[Legendary pitcher, Haroro,
who struck out Hyun Jin.]

1086
01:06:18,792 --> 01:06:22,476
[They face off again today
for the second time.]

1087
01:06:22,477 --> 01:06:24,356
Am I going to get struck out again?

1088
01:06:24,357 --> 01:06:26,674
Get ready to get struck out.

1089
01:06:27,181 --> 01:06:29,593
You're going to find yourself crying home.

1090
01:06:30,390 --> 01:06:37,224
Controller of baseball!

1091
01:06:42,467 --> 01:06:44,033
What was his power?

1092
01:06:44,068 --> 01:06:47,078
[What is it this time?]

1093
01:06:48,068 --> 01:06:49,589
[I vow to hit your throw.]

1094
01:06:49,590 --> 01:06:52,495
[That's not going to happen.]

1095
01:06:55,379 --> 01:06:57,289
[The ball...]

1096
01:06:57,290 --> 01:07:01,331
[Transformed itself into a pigeon?]

1097
01:07:04,375 --> 01:07:08,178
[Magical pitch that can't even be seen
on the field of major league baseball.]

1098
01:07:08,179 --> 01:07:10,694
[Just when everyone's gaze is fixed
upon the flying pigeon.]

1099
01:07:14,548 --> 01:07:16,985
[The ball drops directly into
the glove during that moment.]

1100
01:07:21,862 --> 01:07:25,282
[Strike!]

1101
01:07:28,686 --> 01:07:31,123
- I'm a fan of yours, Legendary Pitcher!
- That was cool.

1102
01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:33,562
The legendary pitcher.

1103
01:07:33,563 --> 01:07:36,574
I can't believe I just witnessed that!
Goodbye!

1104
01:07:36,575 --> 01:07:38,218
Was that a pigeon?

1105
01:07:39,847 --> 01:07:43,197
Ryu Hyun Jin hasn't improved at all
in the past year.

1106
01:07:43,670 --> 01:07:45,841
You're still no match for me.

1107
01:07:46,243 --> 01:07:49,032
Okay, you can start your crying now.

1108
01:07:49,033 --> 01:07:50,301
[Cocky pitcher, Haroro.]

1109
01:07:53,336 --> 01:07:57,499
[What's his next magical pitch?]

1110
01:07:57,500 --> 01:07:59,329
I can't believe I'm witnessing this!
It's like a dream!

1111
01:08:00,524 --> 01:08:02,160
The legendary pitcher!

1112
01:08:04,512 --> 01:08:07,635
[Attack of the CO2.]

1113
01:08:15,814 --> 01:08:18,145
[Amazing!
Hyun Jin still manages to hit the ball!]

1114
01:08:19,206 --> 01:08:22,093
[But he's unfortunately ousted.]

1115
01:08:22,857 --> 01:08:25,523
[Amazed that he was still able to
hit the ball through the smoke.]

1116
01:08:27,040 --> 01:08:28,711
I can't believe he was able to hit it.

1117
01:08:29,923 --> 01:08:33,136
I can't believe he managed to hit that.
That's unbelievable.

1118
01:08:38,243 --> 01:08:40,416
- Fighting, Suzy!
- Show them what you've got.

1119
01:08:40,417 --> 01:08:43,140
- Play ball!
- It's okay, it's Kim Hyun Soo.

1120
01:08:44,821 --> 01:08:46,938
- Time, time.
- Hyun Soo!

1121
01:08:47,688 --> 01:08:49,959
The fence.

1122
01:08:52,117 --> 01:08:54,631
The one who moves the fence!

1123
01:08:55,156 --> 01:08:57,722
The one who moves the fence!

1124
01:08:59,148 --> 01:09:01,670
Why would you move it as
a baseball player?

1125
01:09:06,373 --> 01:09:09,045
[The fence... is closing in.]

1126
01:09:10,171 --> 01:09:15,288
[The fence has been upgraded by
having wheels under put under this year.]

1127
01:09:16,473 --> 01:09:18,274
What if I use this power,
and I still can't hit it over the fence?

1128
01:09:18,275 --> 01:09:20,587
You have to hit a homerun
since you used the power.

1129
01:09:20,588 --> 01:09:22,850
I still have to hit it right
for me to hit a homerun.

1130
01:09:23,344 --> 01:09:26,396
[The Batting Machine being more cautious
after his mistake during first inning.]

1131
01:09:26,397 --> 01:09:29,179
Aren't you a pro baseball player
for a living?

1132
01:09:32,947 --> 01:09:36,468
[The fence moves in right behind
the diamond!]

1133
01:09:36,469 --> 01:09:37,695
Okay!

1134
01:09:37,696 --> 01:09:39,751
- That's too much.
- Suzy.

1135
01:09:39,752 --> 01:09:41,118
We're swapping out our pitcher.

1136
01:09:41,119 --> 01:09:42,792
[An eye for an eye.
Team Hyun Jin swaps out their pitcher.]

1137
01:09:44,656 --> 01:09:47,729
[Batting Machine, Kim Hyun Soo.]

1138
01:09:47,730 --> 01:09:51,446
[Vs. Korean Monster, Ryu Hyun Jin.]

1139
01:09:51,447 --> 01:09:54,597
[A real face-off.]

1140
01:10:06,787 --> 01:10:10,858
[Homerun!]

1141
01:10:12,837 --> 01:10:14,864
[Total excitement.]

1142
01:10:14,865 --> 01:10:17,108
- That's a homerun!
- He's good at baseball!

1143
01:10:17,769 --> 01:10:19,929
- He really is good at this game.
- I'll admit it, he's good at baseball.

1144
01:10:19,930 --> 01:10:22,803
Did you see the expression on his face?
He was so serious about hitting it.

1145
01:10:24,048 --> 01:10:26,525
[I'm going to hit it!]

1146
01:10:27,863 --> 01:10:31,293
[That's Kim Hyun Soo!
Reputation redeemed in one blow!]

1147
01:10:33,361 --> 01:10:36,344
I threw that bat out of nervousness.
I hit it like I was playing in a real game.

1148
01:10:36,345 --> 01:10:38,522
But thanks to the fence,
you were able to redeem yourself.

1149
01:10:39,630 --> 01:10:41,202
[Thank goodness.]

1150
01:10:46,561 --> 01:10:47,542
Play ball.

1151
01:10:48,087 --> 01:10:51,220
[One out and Kwang Soo's at bat.]

1152
01:10:51,948 --> 01:10:54,081
- It's one out.
- Calm down, Kwang Soo.

1153
01:10:55,327 --> 01:10:56,640
Ryu Hyun Jin.

1154
01:10:57,008 --> 01:10:59,418
You struck me out last winter.

1155
01:10:59,419 --> 01:11:01,886
I will show you how
I've improved in the past year.

1156
01:11:02,604 --> 01:11:07,368
My parents' enemy!
I was talking!

1157
01:11:08,386 --> 01:11:10,132
[Totally ignored.]

1158
01:11:10,133 --> 01:11:11,553
Hey, I was talking!

1159
01:11:14,166 --> 01:11:15,853
Just keep your chatter to a minimum.

1160
01:11:16,438 --> 01:11:19,600
- That was a dirty play.
- You're hitter number four, Kwang Soo.

1161
01:11:19,635 --> 01:11:22,327
- Hey, use your powers!
- Use it!

1162
01:11:22,862 --> 01:11:25,583
I'm going to hang everything I have
in this hit!

1163
01:11:25,584 --> 01:11:27,379
Bet everything you have.

1164
01:11:27,380 --> 01:11:29,386
- Lee Kwang Soo just bet everything he has.
- Okay, good!

1165
01:11:29,387 --> 01:11:33,147
[What will come of this?]

1166
01:11:35,116 --> 01:11:37,793
[He somehow manages to hit!]

1167
01:11:38,619 --> 01:11:40,823
He finally manages to hit it
after betting everything he has.

1168
01:11:41,340 --> 01:11:43,744
Can you cancel that?
Cancel what I said about betting everything.

1169
01:11:43,930 --> 01:11:46,345
- I was being too greedy.
- No, it's okay.

1170
01:11:50,771 --> 01:11:53,749
[So close!]

1171
01:11:53,750 --> 01:11:55,959
[But Kwang Soo endures the temptation.]

1172
01:11:56,443 --> 01:11:58,559
- I did good.
- Hyun Jin!

1173
01:11:58,560 --> 01:12:01,004
Isn't that something you do only to
the major league players?

1174
01:12:08,511 --> 01:12:11,414
[Top speed.]

1175
01:12:11,415 --> 01:12:14,312
- You're being too much.
- You're being too harsh.

1176
01:12:14,313 --> 01:12:17,013
[This is how you pitch in the major leagues.]

1177
01:12:17,482 --> 01:12:21,133
[Kwang Soo is struck out again.]

1178
01:12:21,134 --> 01:12:23,229
Why did you throw the ball that fast?

1179
01:12:24,264 --> 01:12:25,511
That was fun.

1180
01:12:28,224 --> 01:12:33,413
[Ha Ha at first base with
Batting King up to bat.]

1181
01:12:34,015 --> 01:12:35,215
Fighting!

1182
01:12:35,792 --> 01:12:38,848
I will show you how it's really done.

1183
01:12:39,228 --> 01:12:41,900
The one who controls the pitch!

1184
01:12:42,634 --> 01:12:44,166
The one who controls the pitch!

1185
01:12:45,231 --> 01:12:47,429
I forgot that our opposing team has
a legendary pitcher as well!

1186
01:12:47,430 --> 01:12:50,293
Hey!
Your pitch was nothing!

1187
01:12:50,294 --> 01:12:52,810
- I can't hand this.
- I will show you a true masterly pitch.

1188
01:12:52,811 --> 01:12:55,804
[Gary vs. Ha Ha.
Battle of their pride.]

1189
01:12:55,805 --> 01:12:59,359
- Just show us what you've got.
- Controller of the pitch.

1190
01:13:02,303 --> 01:13:04,953
- It's an honor to be witnessing this.
- You just wait.

1191
01:13:04,954 --> 01:13:06,785
I've always been in awe of you!

1192
01:13:07,120 --> 01:13:12,014
[Just what kind of a magical pitch
will Pitcher Gae show us?]

1193
01:13:12,015 --> 01:13:14,231
It's an honor to witness this.
What is it?

1194
01:13:18,220 --> 01:13:20,826
[Smoke?]

1195
01:13:24,555 --> 01:13:27,443
[The ball disappears right in front
of their eyes in a cloud of smoke?]

1196
01:13:35,393 --> 01:13:37,947
- Did you not see my ball?
- I didn't see it.

1197
01:13:37,948 --> 01:13:39,784
- Did you not see my ball?
- The ball disappeared.

1198
01:13:40,983 --> 01:13:43,245
- What was that?
- What just happened?

1199
01:13:43,246 --> 01:13:44,825
Just hit it, Byung Kyu!

1200
01:13:44,826 --> 01:13:47,370
I will show you what real
pitching is like.

1201
01:13:47,371 --> 01:13:50,959
[Pitcher Gary showing his skills as
Batting King as his opponent.]

1202
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:53,079
[Winding up for his second pitch.]

1203
01:13:57,807 --> 01:13:59,023
What was that?

1204
01:13:59,589 --> 01:14:02,112
[Unidentifiable pitch gliding towards the base
as if sliding on its own accord.]

1205
01:14:04,523 --> 01:14:07,724
[Strike- Sliding into the catcher's glove
as if attracted by a magnet.]

1206
01:14:10,606 --> 01:14:12,728
- What was that?
- What are you guys doing?

1207
01:14:16,966 --> 01:14:18,981
Did you not see my ball again?

1208
01:14:18,982 --> 01:14:21,064
Why was that ball crawling on the ground?

1209
01:14:23,178 --> 01:14:25,848
I will show you my last final pitch.

1210
01:14:25,849 --> 01:14:26,848
[Gary's final pitch.]

1211
01:14:26,883 --> 01:14:30,291
[One more strike,
and Byung Kyu is struck out.]

1212
01:14:32,872 --> 01:14:34,867
You're not going to be able to hit this.

1213
01:14:37,694 --> 01:14:41,749
[Strikeout for Byung Kyu.]

1214
01:14:43,084 --> 01:14:46,837
[Speechless... I'm the Batter King!]

1215
01:14:47,311 --> 01:14:49,810
[Top of the third inning.]

1216
01:14:49,811 --> 01:14:53,368
- Fighting!
- Get ready for his psychic powers!

1217
01:14:53,369 --> 01:14:55,334
[Pitcher Kim Hyun Soo vs.
Batter Shin Kyung Hyun.]

1218
01:14:55,335 --> 01:14:56,889
Controller of the batter!

1219
01:14:58,256 --> 01:15:00,526
What is that?
What is he doing?

1220
01:15:01,297 --> 01:15:02,557
You just have to pick
whatever you want.

1221
01:15:02,558 --> 01:15:05,357
- Ah, I see.
- Do you see any chopsticks in there?

1222
01:15:05,358 --> 01:15:08,517
[Can choose any object he wants
for the opposing batter to hit with.]

1223
01:15:11,160 --> 01:15:13,470
Why are you doing this to me?

1224
01:15:15,339 --> 01:15:18,748
[Shin Kyung Hyun's bat
transformed into an oar.]

1225
01:15:25,680 --> 01:15:28,531
[Hyun Soo seemingly happy
with his psychic power.]

1226
01:15:29,334 --> 01:15:31,427
[I'm not letting you get away with this.]

1227
01:15:31,428 --> 01:15:34,054
[With the right hit,
it could be a homerun.]

1228
01:15:43,057 --> 01:15:46,317
[Due to Blank Ji's slight delay,
Shin Kyung Hyun's safe.]

1229
01:15:47,772 --> 01:15:50,368
Kwang Soo!
Use your power!

1230
01:15:50,910 --> 01:15:53,088
I wasn't going to use this power.

1231
01:15:53,089 --> 01:15:54,465
It's you!

1232
01:15:55,268 --> 01:15:59,415
Field of thorns!
Spread yourself from first to second base!

1233
01:16:05,981 --> 01:16:08,188
Why do you keep doing this to me!

1234
01:16:09,036 --> 01:16:11,395
[Once he steps onto the mat...
he realizes that it's no joke.]

1235
01:16:11,396 --> 01:16:12,496
Hey!

1236
01:16:13,534 --> 01:16:15,356
You have to keep standing on it.

1237
01:16:15,357 --> 01:16:21,693
[Must run on the acupuncture mat as he
makes his way over to second base.]

1238
01:16:22,282 --> 01:16:23,987
We've run on that so many times.

1239
01:16:24,341 --> 01:16:26,785
- You have to run on it.
- I'll hit a homerun for you, Kyung Hyun.

1240
01:16:27,649 --> 01:16:31,090
Don't hit, and just let him strike you out.

1241
01:16:31,091 --> 01:16:32,575
I said, don't hit it!

1242
01:16:33,910 --> 01:16:36,528
[If you hit it,
then I have to walk on this mat...]

1243
01:16:36,529 --> 01:16:37,622
I'm going to do this.

1244
01:16:44,398 --> 01:16:47,965
[Shin Kyung Hyun ultimately starts running
on the mat over to second base.]

1245
01:16:54,294 --> 01:16:56,727
[Ha Ha on second base makes a huge mistake!]

1246
01:16:56,728 --> 01:16:59,953
[Succeeds in making it safely
to second base.]

1247
01:16:59,954 --> 01:17:02,468
- How could you have missed it?
- The ball was thrown wrong.

1248
01:17:04,404 --> 01:17:06,998
[That mat is no joke.]

1249
01:17:07,473 --> 01:17:11,397
[Bases are fully loaded with two outs.
This could be their chance!]

1250
01:17:11,398 --> 01:17:12,402
I have no other choice.

1251
01:17:13,256 --> 01:17:15,795
[Team Jae Suk seems to be
planning something.]

1252
01:17:15,796 --> 01:17:18,488
[What did they come up with?]

1253
01:17:18,489 --> 01:17:20,971
After you struck me out last summer...

1254
01:17:20,972 --> 01:17:22,920
- That was last winter.
- Oh yeah, it was winter.

1255
01:17:23,337 --> 01:17:25,466
After you struck me out last winter...

1256
01:17:25,467 --> 01:17:27,755
I have been waiting for this moment
this whole past year.

1257
01:17:27,756 --> 01:17:31,362
- Poktusul!
- Poktusul? What's that?

1258
01:17:31,957 --> 01:17:36,109
[Poktusul?
What kind of a power is that?]

1259
01:17:36,110 --> 01:17:37,481
Is he going to do something weird?

1260
01:17:40,281 --> 01:17:42,284
[Everyone's caught off guard.]

1261
01:17:42,285 --> 01:17:43,951
[But Hyun Jin...]

1262
01:17:43,952 --> 01:17:47,841
[That's right!]

1263
01:17:47,842 --> 01:17:50,405
[I've been waiting for this!]

1264
01:17:54,355 --> 01:17:57,975
[The king of remaining calm, Hyun Jin!]

1265
01:17:57,976 --> 01:18:00,907
[A nice hit with all the bases loaded!]

1266
01:18:05,839 --> 01:18:08,550
[He beat the Poktusul pitch!]

1267
01:18:08,551 --> 01:18:11,216
[Amazing, Hyun Jin...]

1268
01:18:11,217 --> 01:18:12,732
I'll see you next year!

1269
01:18:12,733 --> 01:18:15,506
I'm going to work on a another skill
until we meet again next year!

1270
01:18:15,507 --> 01:18:17,759
[To make a joke of a skill that
he's worked on for the past year.]

1271
01:18:17,856 --> 01:18:19,361
No!

1272
01:18:20,703 --> 01:18:22,970
- What was that? Even I was shocked.
- That was amazing.

1273
01:18:22,971 --> 01:18:24,637
You were awesome.

1274
01:18:25,129 --> 01:18:28,269
You're really good at playing baseball.
You're really good at batting.

1275
01:18:28,783 --> 01:18:30,711
- Use your powers, Byung Kyu.
- Okay.

1276
01:18:30,712 --> 01:18:32,275
Use it, Byung Kyu.

1277
01:18:32,276 --> 01:18:36,654
Magical zone!

1278
01:18:37,507 --> 01:18:41,037
[To recant the spell so perfectly!]

1279
01:18:41,038 --> 01:18:42,377
[Happy with himself.]

1280
01:18:43,885 --> 01:18:46,914
[Shouting it out proudly without
a hint of embarrassment.]

1281
01:18:46,915 --> 01:18:48,379
What is that?

1282
01:18:53,770 --> 01:18:56,658
[Huh? A net?]

1283
01:18:56,659 --> 01:18:59,007
Touch the net, and you're out!

1284
01:18:59,008 --> 01:19:01,831
What is that?

1285
01:19:02,169 --> 01:19:06,344
[This is the Magical Zone.]

1286
01:19:07,711 --> 01:19:09,920
[The bases are still fully loaded,
and this could be their chance!]

1287
01:19:11,450 --> 01:19:13,421
Hit it out of there!

1288
01:19:13,422 --> 01:19:14,797
Play ball!

1289
01:19:16,154 --> 01:19:20,058
[Must make sure not to hit
the magical zone with his ball!]

1290
01:19:24,777 --> 01:19:27,840
[Where is the ball headed?]

1291
01:19:34,565 --> 01:19:38,512
[Gets sucked directly into the magical zone.]

1292
01:19:39,895 --> 01:19:43,188
[Shin Kyung Hyun- Three outs.]

1293
01:19:44,211 --> 01:19:47,517
[Lee Byung Kyu's magical zone
proves to be a huge success.]

1294
01:19:48,847 --> 01:19:54,612
[Team Ryu- 4 vs. Team Yoo- 2.]

1295
01:19:55,517 --> 01:19:58,418
[And during the fourth inning...]

1296
01:19:58,419 --> 01:20:00,540
I'm the Batter King!

1297
01:20:00,541 --> 01:20:02,436
[Blank Ji shows that she's
the true Batter King.]

1298
01:20:09,450 --> 01:20:13,790
[The play continues on until the opposing
team can find the real ball out of others.]

1299
01:20:14,453 --> 01:20:16,239
[Team Jae Suk manages to score a point
thanks to Ji Hyo's power.]

1300
01:20:16,240 --> 01:20:18,625
[Team Jae Suk- 3 vs. Team Hyun Jin- 4.]

1301
01:20:18,626 --> 01:20:22,177
[Team Hyun Jin scores three more points
during bottom of the fourth inning.]

1302
01:20:25,776 --> 01:20:29,127
[Team Jae Suk tricks Jong Kook
and gets him ousted.]

1303
01:20:29,128 --> 01:20:32,949
[Bottom of the Third-
Team Jae Suk- 3 vs. Team Hyun Jin- 7.]

1304
01:20:34,639 --> 01:20:39,236
[The last inning.
Team Jae Suk's last chance to score.]

1305
01:20:39,237 --> 01:20:41,124
This is our last chance.
We have to use all our powers.

1306
01:20:41,125 --> 01:20:43,695
- We have to use everything.
- We have to turn this game around.

1307
01:20:43,696 --> 01:20:46,255
- Okay, let's do it.
- Let's turn this game around.

1308
01:20:47,635 --> 01:20:49,134
One, two, three.
Fighting!

1309
01:20:49,904 --> 01:20:53,532
We have to be smart about this.
We have to keep them on their toes.

1310
01:20:53,533 --> 01:20:56,636
They're going to try to use their powers.
Team Hefty Ryu, fighting!

1311
01:20:57,704 --> 01:21:01,069
This is Team Jae Suk's last chance to score.
No score, and Team Ryu wins.

1312
01:21:01,741 --> 01:21:05,426
[Will they manage to turn the game around,
or will they lose?]

1313
01:21:05,427 --> 01:21:06,787
The real beauty of baseball is
a turnabout in the game.

1314
01:21:07,108 --> 01:21:09,241
Come to me, magical bat!

1315
01:21:10,227 --> 01:21:11,496
What's that?

1316
01:21:17,877 --> 01:21:20,056
You can't throw the ball,
but you have to roll it on the ground.

1317
01:21:20,057 --> 01:21:22,102
- How is that even baseball?
- Okay, we got this!

1318
01:21:22,103 --> 01:21:23,960
- Ji Hyo!
- You can do this!

1319
01:21:23,961 --> 01:21:25,821
- You can do this, right?
- I can do this!

1320
01:21:28,940 --> 01:21:31,607
The one who controls the
defense line!

1321
01:21:34,108 --> 01:21:37,341
[They really are using
all their psychic powers!]

1322
01:21:37,342 --> 01:21:42,876
I want all the defensive players to be taken
to that corner over there and stay there.

1323
01:21:42,877 --> 01:21:45,425
[All the defensive players to be moved
to that tiny corner over there.]

1324
01:21:50,490 --> 01:21:52,018
What is this?

1325
01:21:52,019 --> 01:21:53,939
All of you, back up!
Back up!

1326
01:21:55,345 --> 01:21:57,861
[Then the pitcher is
the only line of defense?]

1327
01:21:57,862 --> 01:22:00,553
[Team Hyun Jin's whole defense line
is moved way back.]

1328
01:22:00,554 --> 01:22:02,046
Hurry up and move it!

1329
01:22:04,380 --> 01:22:07,235
- What is this?
- This is making me nervous.

1330
01:22:09,087 --> 01:22:11,394
- How am I going to do this?
- Hit the ball and make a run for it!

1331
01:22:12,096 --> 01:22:14,385
[Roll the ball like kickball.]

1332
01:22:23,313 --> 01:22:25,383
[The pitcher must carry the ball
all the way over to first base.]

1333
01:22:30,105 --> 01:22:33,904
[Touches down safely at an empty base.]

1334
01:22:34,627 --> 01:22:38,283
[Team Jae Suk manages to get
the first base loaded.]

1335
01:22:38,958 --> 01:22:41,156
[Team Jae Suk with all the bases loaded,
and two outs.]

1336
01:22:41,696 --> 01:22:43,866
Am I the last batter?

1337
01:22:43,867 --> 01:22:46,528
[Jae Suk is ultimately the final batter?]

1338
01:22:46,529 --> 01:22:48,701
[Must hit a homerun to turn
the game around.]

1339
01:22:48,702 --> 01:22:51,758
[Ousted, and it's game over.]

1340
01:22:51,759 --> 01:22:54,514
Anything can happen on the bottom
of the ninth with two outs in baseball.

1341
01:22:54,910 --> 01:22:56,516
I'm really nervous.

1342
01:22:56,517 --> 01:22:58,438
If you get ousted, then it's game over.

1343
01:22:58,439 --> 01:23:00,872
Stop saying that to me!
You don't think I know that?

1344
01:23:01,243 --> 01:23:03,355
You could go down in history!

1345
01:23:03,356 --> 01:23:07,769
[Will I be the last to get ousted,
or will I save the team?]

1346
01:23:12,262 --> 01:23:15,718
[Two outs and the bases are loaded.]

1347
01:23:17,968 --> 01:23:20,060
[If I hit a homerun...]

1348
01:23:20,061 --> 01:23:22,806
[Then I can turn this game around!]

1349
01:23:22,807 --> 01:23:25,940
[I have to do this!]

1350
01:23:27,830 --> 01:23:30,477
[Strike one.]

1351
01:23:30,478 --> 01:23:32,277
- I'm nervous.
- This is making me really nervous.

1352
01:23:37,348 --> 01:23:40,343
[One ball and one strike.]

1353
01:23:52,343 --> 01:23:55,266
[Hits the ball towards Gary!]

1354
01:23:57,383 --> 01:23:59,572
[Gary loses the ball!]

1355
01:24:00,667 --> 01:24:04,005
[This is it!
Run with everything you have!]

1356
01:24:06,091 --> 01:24:08,221
[Blank Ji makes it home!]

1357
01:24:13,188 --> 01:24:15,419
[Hyun Soo makes it home!]

1358
01:24:17,994 --> 01:24:20,171
[And even Kwang Soo makes it home!
Three points scored!]

1359
01:24:20,172 --> 01:24:24,407
[Yoo Jae Suk helps score
three points for his team!]

1360
01:24:24,408 --> 01:24:28,723
[Bottom of the fifth inning.
Team Jae Suk- 6 vs. Team Hyun Jin- 7.]

1361
01:24:30,598 --> 01:24:34,878
[How can this be...]

1362
01:24:37,565 --> 01:24:41,449
[Only a one point difference!
One more out and it's game over.]

1363
01:24:41,450 --> 01:24:42,709
We just need to get one more.

1364
01:24:42,710 --> 01:24:43,857
Play ball!

1365
01:24:44,045 --> 01:24:48,599
[Will they turn it around...
or will this be their end?]

1366
01:24:50,294 --> 01:24:52,833
Come to me, magical bat!

1367
01:24:58,226 --> 01:25:00,316
[The ball transforms itself.]

1368
01:25:01,134 --> 01:25:04,357
[The fate of the team rests
in Blank Ji's foot.]

1369
01:25:04,358 --> 01:25:05,733
- We have to stay on our toes.
- Kick it hard.

1370
01:25:05,734 --> 01:25:07,311
[Please...]

1371
01:25:08,411 --> 01:25:09,462
Kick it hard.

1372
01:25:12,723 --> 01:25:15,364
[It's game over if they oust Blank Ji!]

1373
01:25:16,381 --> 01:25:18,991
[Will they be able to pull it off?]

1374
01:25:20,630 --> 01:25:23,869
[Safe]

1375
01:25:23,870 --> 01:25:26,828
[Team Jae Suk making it possible
to turn the game around.]

1376
01:25:29,805 --> 01:25:35,702
[Next up to bat to throw more fuel
to the fire is, Kim Hyun Soo.]

1377
01:25:35,703 --> 01:25:39,083
[And Hyun Jin steps up to the mound
to stop him.]

1378
01:25:40,949 --> 01:25:44,057
It's two outs at the bottom of the last inning
and it's Kim Hyun Soo against Ryu Hyun Jin!

1379
01:25:44,058 --> 01:25:47,028
- Wow, this is nerve wrecking!
- Nice!

1380
01:25:47,029 --> 01:25:51,397
[An unavoidable final face-off.]

1381
01:25:57,983 --> 01:25:59,821
[Ball]

1382
01:25:59,822 --> 01:26:02,803
[Hyun Soo being picky with his swings.]

1383
01:26:06,087 --> 01:26:11,780
[Second pitch...]

1384
01:26:11,781 --> 01:26:15,744
[A strike!]

1385
01:26:16,684 --> 01:26:18,477
Don't get flustered, Kim Hyun Soo.

1386
01:26:18,478 --> 01:26:19,775
It's okay.

1387
01:26:20,340 --> 01:26:23,014
No need to be that nervous!
It's okay to breathe!

1388
01:26:30,819 --> 01:26:33,425
[Jae Suk on third base flies
towards home base!]

1389
01:26:33,426 --> 01:26:36,010
[The score will be tied as long as
no one gets ousted in first or second base!]

1390
01:26:36,011 --> 01:26:37,399
Keep going!

1391
01:26:44,165 --> 01:26:47,183
[Blank Ji ousted on second base.]

1392
01:26:47,218 --> 01:26:49,342
[Flustered Blank Ji
rushed back to first base.]

1393
01:26:49,343 --> 01:26:51,230
The one who controls time!

1394
01:26:52,368 --> 01:26:54,654
Why isn't it working?
Why isn't my power working?

1395
01:26:55,389 --> 01:26:58,836
[Game over]

1396
01:26:58,837 --> 01:27:01,989
[Final score-
Team Jae Suk- 6 vs. Team Hyun Jin- 7]

1397
01:27:01,990 --> 01:27:05,903
[Team Hyun Jin wins
2013 Psychic Baseball.]

1398
01:27:06,688 --> 01:27:12,135
Byung Kyu's the Batter King and all he did
was wear a blindfold a couple of times.

1399
01:27:12,300 --> 01:27:14,645
[We apologize, and we hope
that you come back on our show.]

1400
01:27:14,646 --> 01:27:17,517
['R' marked gold ring is given out
to the players of the winning team.]

1401
01:27:22,431 --> 01:27:24,129
I should wear this when
I'm rapping.

1402
01:27:25,439 --> 01:27:27,103
It's pretty.

1403
01:27:27,104 --> 01:27:33,002
To Lee Byung Kyu, Kim Hyun Soo and
Coach Shin Kyung Hyun who joined us today...

1404
01:27:33,003 --> 01:27:34,813
We'd like to thank you all again
from the bottom of our hearts.

1405
01:27:36,543 --> 01:27:40,595
Suzy, who's been with us
for the past two weeks...

1406
01:27:41,939 --> 01:27:44,855
And also, Ryu Hyun Jin!

1407
01:27:44,856 --> 01:27:47,816
[We'll keep cheering for you,
Korean Monster, Ryu Hyun Jin!]

1408
01:27:48,732 --> 01:27:52,165
- Byung Kyu was really good at chanting.
- He was awesome at recanting his spell.

1409
01:27:52,166 --> 01:27:54,751
- That was the best I've heard it being done.
- How did you do that?

1410
01:27:55,770 --> 01:27:58,969
Magical zone!
