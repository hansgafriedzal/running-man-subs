Running Man

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:05,330
<i>[Winter 2013]</i>

3
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:09,360
<i>They're not going to ask us
to cross the Han River, are they?</i>

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,240
<i>- How can they expect us to do that?
- Do we have to do something at Han River?</i>

5
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:20,060
[A mission that no one
could have even fathomed.]

6
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:24,550
[The game that went down
in Running Man history...]

7
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:28,300
[It'll happen once again on the Han River.]

8
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:35,220
[Fast flowing water currents...
and the time that flows just as fast...]

9
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:39,620
[Having kept up the breathless pace
for the past three and a half years.]

10
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:44,090
[This time, they're taking on
the Han River challenge.]

11
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:47,690
[The battle...]

12
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:51,610
[of Running Man against the Han River...]

13
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:56,090
[What result will come of it?]

14
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:02,430
[Earlier this morning.]

15
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:04,510
[Huh?]

16
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:06,340
Let's protest!

17
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:11,580
[Cast of Running Man on strike?]

18
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,300
We're going to have some words today.

19
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:20,950
Please. No more bungee jumps.
Let's stop those.

20
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:24,290
No more water games!
I refuse to play them anymore!

21
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:26,380
[A variety of different conditions.]

22
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:29,890
This is a negotiation table.

23
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:32,150
[A negotiation table that's been prepared
for their end of the year meeting.]

24
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:36,340
We need to have them take all these into
consideration for the year 2014.

25
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:39,380
- We need to change up the games.
- Yes, you're right.

26
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:42,830
- I think we've done enough.
- I change my underwear 3 times in the summer.

27
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:45,790
Do you know how much laundry
I have to do at home?

28
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:47,940
No matter how many times I wash my clothes,
I still find dirt on them.

29
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:50,080
Even my stylist isn't happy with this.

30
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:54,030
We've played a total of 24 water games
during this past year.

31
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:56,110
That's too much.

32
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:58,060
24 water games?
That's unbelievable.

33
00:01:58,060 --> 00:01:59,590
A total of five acupuncture mat games.

34
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,400
Remember when Seung Gi came onto
our show in the middle of the winter?

35
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,730
Remember that water spray game
we had to play at the carwash?

36
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:08,670
[Seung Gi was given an ice cold
shower in the middle of the winter.]

37
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:11,370
Remember when Shin Yang was on?

38
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:13,410
[Even the gentlest Park Shin Yang blew up
during the ice cold water game.]

39
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:19,820
[The muddy rice paddy mission that even
the fashionista, GD, couldn't escape.]

40
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:23,150
- And the bungee jumps are getting too crazy.
- Yes, it is.

41
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:25,370
Ji Hyo actually had to fly through the sky.

42
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:32,050
Even though I never said anything,
but back when Big Bang came on the show...

43
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:35,930
I can tell you now that our own team members
really stunk like frogs during the missions.

44
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:40,260
They all smelled like the mucky water,
and smelled like frogs too.

45
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:43,580
How can us humans be made to smell
like the amphibians?

46
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:47,080
I'm starting to grow weeds
under my armpits.

47
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:50,050
- Why did you have to say that?
- I'm serious, they're growing under there!

48
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:52,220
Gary's not saying anything wrong.

49
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:56,910
But just because you feel that way,
we can't totally stop playing water games.

50
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:59,220
- I know that we can't completely stop...
- But we're asking to use more discretion.

51
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,910
Let's only play those games
until the fall starts.

52
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:03,590
Here's our point.

53
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:06,270
We understand that we could fall into
the water while playing some of the games.

54
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:09,910
We have no problems with playing games that
may have us fall into the water at times.

55
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,700
But we're asking to abstain from going into
the water specifically to play these games.

56
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,450
Wow, you're being so agreeable.

57
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:19,810
Okay, this meeting was organized to take in
your suggestions and comments

58
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:22,390
into consideration as part of
our 2013 year end closing.

59
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:26,200
- Have you made all your points?
- That was the jist of it.

60
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:29,340
Then I'd like to make a proposal.

61
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:32,860
How about we play a game today...

62
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:36,930
to determine how we're going to close out
this 2013 year end meeting?

63
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:38,560
One determining game?

64
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:44,300
That's why today's mission has been titled,
Running Man vs The Writers Year End Race.

65
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:47,300
[Today's mission- War against the writers!
Running Man vs The Writers Year End Race.]

66
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:49,150
What's the race?

67
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:51,700
So you're saying that our conditions will be
met if we win against the writers?

68
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:53,680
I can't even imagine what kind of
a tough game you have prepared for this.

69
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,690
- Let's play the name tag elimination game!
- Sounds good to me!

70
00:03:56,690 --> 00:03:59,360
- That sounds good to me!
- Let's take this to the acupuncture mat!

71
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,880
- How about the water?
- Let's go to the rice paddy!

72
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,850
Let's play the name tag elimination game
on top of the acupuncture mat!

73
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:05,940
How about the cat and mouse game
with the bells?

74
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:08,570
What we have prepared is a group mission.

75
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:11,790
[Must pass the group mission that the writers
have come up with...]

76
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:14,360
[To win the running ball depending on
the end results of the group mission.]

77
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:18,120
<i>So the better you do at these missions,
the more running balls you can collect.</i>

78
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:23,450
The running balls you'll win will come to play
an extremely vital role at the final mission.

79
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:30,340
Your most hated water related punishment
awaits if you fail at your final mission.

80
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:35,050
However, since this is a race
against the writers...

81
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:36,800
depending on who wins or loses
today's race...

82
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:42,490
seven members of the writing staff
can also be punished equally.

83
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:47,390
- Seriously?
- You're actually being agreeable for once.

84
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:51,780
- We have to win no matter what.
- Can we choose the staff members?

85
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:54,500
- Can we pick?
- We want to be able to pick the members.

86
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,800
Who would you like to pick?

87
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:59,230
- I'd first like to choose PD Jo Hyo Jin.
- I'd like to choose PD Myuk.

88
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:02,750
- I want Joo Hyung.
- I want Hyung Taek.

89
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:05,040
- We need Min Soo too.
- Yes, Min Soo.

90
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:08,180
- How about Ji Min?
- Min Soo really embarrassed me yesterday.

91
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:12,140
If we play this right, and do a good job,
we can see the writers get crushed.

92
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:14,240
- Let's do this.
- We've never done anything like this before.

93
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,960
- Let's show them what it's like.
- Writers' first time getting soaked.

94
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,260
We've even prepared our own
team uniform.

95
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:22,280
[Even the writers are outfitted with
their own team uniform.]

96
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,350
Let's play the name tag elimination.

97
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,900
I bet we can eliminate all your name tags
within the first five minutes.

98
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:30,060
I'm confident I can do it
even while blindfolded.

99
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:32,470
- Then do you accept the proposal?
- Yes, of course.

100
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:37,250
[Running Man vs The Writers-
The battle is on!]

101
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:40,280
[Then off to the first mission location!]

102
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:43,950
- Let's do this!
- Let's really win this thing today.

103
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,680
I'm going to bet everything I have.
I'm going to bet my whole life's fortune.

104
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,860
Everyone must forget about
playing as an individual.

105
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:52,840
[Starting the mental coaching of the members
just like he has done every other day.]

106
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:10,070
[A never before seen cheer for victory.]

107
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:16,570
[Running Man vs The Writers-
Start!]

108
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:19,240
They're not going to make us play any
water games on a day like today, are they?

109
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:21,640
[There is something special
we've got prepared...]

110
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:24,870
- Let's win!
- We can win as a team!

111
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:29,600
- Today is the day.
- You're right. Today is the day.

112
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,950
It's really comforting to know that there
won't be any betrayals going on today.

113
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:35,400
He could still betray us in an effort
to look good in front of the writers.

114
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,910
Kwang Soo could make some sort
of a deal with them or something.

115
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:41,550
[They can't let down their guards
when it comes to the Giraffe.]

116
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:45,590
I noticed that Suk Jin didn't come across
too strong with the writers earlier.

117
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:48,380
[Suk Jin seemed too tame with the writers?]

118
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:49,880
I'm going to keep my eye on you.

119
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:53,300
This is our last show of the year.
Let's make it a good one for us.

120
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:57,570
[Everyone to work well together,
and have a nice day together?]

121
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:00,350
- That's what I'd like too.
- The emergency underwear we all brought...

122
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:03,610
- Let's all wear them at home tomorrow.
- Let's do that!

123
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:07,030
- Yes, lets wear them tomorrow!
- Nice and dry!

124
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:11,110
Let's stay nice and dry!

125
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:14,030
Let's stay nice and dry today.

126
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:17,670
[Big-nose lyrical machine that's activated
whenever a keyword is given.]

127
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:21,350
Let's stay nice and dry today.

128
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:26,960
Let's not get wet,
and stay nice and dry today.

129
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:32,010
- Let's win!
- Yes, let's beat them!

130
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:39,030
<i>What is this?</i>

131
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:41,430
- What is it?
- What is this?

132
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:45,710
Is this what I think it is?

133
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,360
[Jenga?]

134
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:53,670
[A gigantic Jenga.]

135
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:56,480
- It's a Jenga.
- It's a giant sized Jenga.

136
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:01,710
- What is this?
- It really is Jenga.

137
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:05,300
- You all know that it won't be easy today?
- Of course. We're prepared.

138
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:09,260
This is the 2013 Running Man Year End Game,
The Human Jenga.

139
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:12,020
One person will have to climb up to the top.

140
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:18,320
[One person to climb up
to the top of the Jenga tower.]

141
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:20,540
The remaining six of you will pull out
the Jenga pieces from the set.

142
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:23,540
If you can all pull out the pieces without
crumbling it, then you succeed the mission.

143
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:26,440
There are a total of 15 running balls
that are riding on this mission.

144
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,910
Wow, that's a lot of balls at stake.

145
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:34,620
The remaining six members have to pull out
four pieces each in order to succeed.

146
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:41,760
[Running Man vs The Writers-
A total of three rounds of group missions.]

147
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:45,060
[The writers will gain a total of ten balls
with each game that they play.]

148
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:47,770
Yes, since we've created these games,
we'll gain ten balls per game outright.

149
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,860
Don't you think that's being too cocky?

150
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,620
So if you succeed each round,
then you'll win a total of 45 balls.

151
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:58,330
[Succeed all three rounds,
and win up to a total of 45 running balls.]

152
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:00,010
This isn't going to be easy.

153
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:03,040
- If this Jinga crumbles...
- It's 'Jenga'.

154
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,000
It's 'Jenga', not 'Jinga'.

155
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:09,100
[Already worrying about it crumbling...]

156
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:12,640
We've prepared a wire, so
there's no need to worry about falling.

157
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:15,170
However, the remaining six members on
the ground will have to hurry out of the way.

158
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,510
Yes, we understand.

159
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:19,850
Is that why you gave us
these heavily padded coats today?

160
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:24,380
- That's going overboard.
- They really are reaching for it today.

161
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:26,060
[They haven't even started the race,
and the atmosphere is already frightening.]

162
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:27,640
[Then you're not going to
get out of the way?]

163
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:29,120
We'll show you what
water punishments feels like.

164
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,920
You each have to pull out four pieces,
totaling in 24 pieces.

165
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,890
- 24 pieces is a lot.
- There are a total of 60 Jenga pieces.

166
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:37,100
That's not even half the Jenga set.

167
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:42,380
- Have you tried this?
- Yes, we've tried it all.

168
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:44,430
- How many pieces did you pull out?
- We pulled out a lot.

169
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:47,710
- Decide which one of you will go up.
- Ji Hyo. Ji Hyo will go up.

170
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:51,380
[Everyone shouts out
Ji Hyo's name in unison.]

171
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:53,520
It's because I'm light, right?
Not because you're scared?

172
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:56,090
Come on, Ji Hyo.
Why would we be scared of that height?

173
00:09:56,100 --> 00:10:00,000
- Then why don't you go up, Jae Suk?
- I would, but I have to pull out the pieces.

174
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:05,810
- Ha Ha should go up there instead.
- They're not pulling her up by the string?

175
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:07,950
Is it high up there?

176
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:09,970
- That looks safer than I expected.
- It's high.

177
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:12,740
- That looks pretty safe though.
- No, it's really high up here.

178
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:17,250
[A gigantic sized Jenga tower that
reaches a total height of 7m.]

179
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:20,910
No matter what we say,
she's the bravest one of us all.

180
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:24,810
- Isn't that shaky?
- I can see it shaking.

181
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:30,130
- She's seriously like a superwoman.
- This is a lot shakier than I had thought.

182
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:33,800
- Really?
- How can you say that so casually?

183
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,210
[Light Ji Hyo is now perched
on top of the Jenga tower.]

184
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:39,840
Let's pull out the highest piece
that we can first.

185
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,100
- Okay.
- Let's move quickly.

186
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:44,540
- Okay, let's start.
- Nice and dry!

187
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:48,620
[Singing the Dry Song to cheer themselves on.]

188
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:57,380
I think Kwang Soo needs to boost us up.

189
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:59,280
[Human Jenga- Mission Start]

190
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,180
[Planning on pulling out the highest piece
they can by utilizing the Giraffe's height.]

191
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:07,130
- You're our human ladder.
- Step onto his shoulders.

192
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:14,810
It's nice to have the Giraffe on our team.

193
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:18,060
Grab my ankles.
Should I pull this one out?

194
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:19,780
[The first piece is the most crucial piece.]

195
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:21,940
- Can you pull out the one next to it?
- Anything higher?

196
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:24,520
Just pull it!
Just pull it out!

197
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:29,700
- Okay, I'll pull this one out.
- Pull it!

198
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:34,150
[The Jenga pieces are too large
to pull out in just one attempt.]

199
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,550
[To the other side?]

200
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:43,900
[Human ladder, Giraffe,
screaming out in pain.]

201
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:45,340
You can just pull it out now.

202
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:47,960
- What role am I playing today?
- You're our step-ladder.

203
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,920
What are we going to do about
Kwang Soo later?

204
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,870
[They're still working on their first piece-
Coming around to the back of the set...]

205
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:56,520
Climb back up onto his shoulders.

206
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,430
Be careful!

207
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,460
Be careful!

208
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:09,800
[Blank Ji is flattening her body down
to keep the tower as steady as possible.]

209
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:12,640
- Get the one down there.
- You really look like a monkey with that on.

210
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,260
[Fly, little monkey!]

211
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:19,860
Okay, I got it.

212
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:22,280
- Okay, I got it.
- You can't knock it down.

213
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:25,550
- Can I stand now?
- Stand up. One, two, three.

214
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:29,530
We have to support Kwang Soo.

215
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:33,060
- We're going to keep nice and dry today.
- Let's win this thing today.

216
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:38,690
- Hurry!
- Let's go around.

217
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,040
- You can't get it in one try?
- No, we can't. Sit down, Gary.

218
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,110
Can we get a stick or something?

219
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:48,300
- Can't we get some sort of a tool?
- This is too much.

220
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,760
[Having to go back and forth every time
they have to pull out a block.]

221
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,400
We can't topple the Jenga tower over.

222
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,850
We should be more worried about
toppling one of us over.

223
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:56,960
[Jenga has all of a sudden become
more important than a human being.]

224
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:59,140
Even if you end up getting up,
we can't hurt this Jenga tower.

225
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:01,350
- We should be more worried about the people.
- We can't have Kwang Soo getting hurt.

226
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:03,810
[Slowly moving over to the other side.]

227
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:06,230
Make sure to fall backwards
if you feel like you're going to fall.

228
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,670
We got a lot of it out.

229
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:11,020
- Okay, pull it out.
- There you go.

230
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:12,970
Okay!

231
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:16,210
[Managed to successfully pull
two of them out.]

232
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:19,230
I feel like there's so much love
between us right now.

233
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:27,380
Let's use this at least.
It's too hard doing this without anything.

234
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:31,320
- Let's push it all the way out with this.
- Come on, let us use this at least.

235
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,550
[Coolly allows the use of the stick.]

236
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:36,170
I think Dong Hoon can do this one.
You can do this one, right?

237
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:40,600
[Kkuk is transformed into a nagging teacher
as soon as he gets the stick in his hand.]

238
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,630
- Dong Hoon can do this one.
- Are you the site manager or something?

239
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,960
- I'm just trying to set a plan for us.
- Seriously.

240
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:49,320
Why are you all listening to him
so intently?

241
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:53,100
- Come on, seriously.
- Do you want to get beat?

242
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:58,590
- I don't think I should have to do this.
- Yes, you need to do this.

243
00:13:58,590 --> 00:14:00,540
[The Giraffe is continuing to play his role
of being the human ladder.]

244
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:03,340
You've really gained a lot of weight.

245
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:06,080
[The Running Man members are given special
permission to use the stick as their tool.]

246
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:09,520
- Hang on, wait a second.
- Dong Hoon's gotten really heavy.

247
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:16,500
[Much easier now with their tool.]

248
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:19,350
[Three down!]

249
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:25,770
[Working much faster
with the use of their stick.]

250
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:32,870
[Combination of the Giraffe's neck and
the stick has given wings to their speed.]

251
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:35,560
We got it!

252
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:42,400
[Really?]

253
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,640
[Hm...]

254
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:47,870
- You think I'd be okay with a lower one?
- Let's get this done!

255
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:50,490
A couple of you need to stand on either side
of Kwang Soo and help support him.

256
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:54,810
[Manager Kkuk tries to pull out a piece
high up in the tower.]

257
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,020
- Which one of you is pulling down my pants?
- I'm just grabbing you by the waist.

258
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:02,250
- What's the point of grabbing my pants?
- You don't like it?

259
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:04,330
- Why are you holding onto my pants?
- I'm not so sure about this one.

260
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:09,890
You're about to pull the one out at the edge.

261
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:12,180
Be careful how you pull it out.

262
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:16,190
- No, Jong Kook. You can't do that one.
- You're knocking it off the center.

263
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:18,150
- Don't touch it anymore.
- No, Jong Kook.

264
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:21,090
- It's twisted sideways.
- You're making it crooked.

265
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:23,900
- Hang on a minute.
- Is it okay now?

266
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:26,150
Hit it in the middle.

267
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:28,920
[Isn't budging no matter how hard
he tries to push it out.]

268
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,800
- Lift him up higher.
- It's shaking.

269
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:36,310
[The tower is starting to
lose its center of balance.]

270
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:38,640
We're just going to give up!

271
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,690
Just prepare a water game for next week.

272
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:47,180
Jong Kook! Would it be easier
to pull it from the other side?

273
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:49,600
- Go around where?
- The edge is already sticking out.

274
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:51,950
- Where do you think we're going?
- It's already sticking out.

275
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:54,340
- Just endure it a little bit longer.
- Just hold on a little bit longer.

276
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:55,830
Okay, I'm going to try going
to the other side.

277
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:59,690
When I reach for a higher piece,
none of you can help support my back, right?

278
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:01,790
So without that support on my back,
I can't put any strength into my pushing.

279
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:03,930
You can just go up and do it that way.

280
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:09,240
You can just go up and do it that way.
There's no need for you to explain it to us.

281
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,990
- I'm trying to tell you that...
- Just go up there and do a good job!

282
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:14,290
Can't you see how we're all suffering
down here because of you?

283
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:17,030
[Crying out a protest for
the human stepladder?]

284
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:19,500
Just go up there and get your job done!

285
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:22,420
- Stop lecturing us, and just do it!
- What is going on here right now?

286
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:25,910
Okay, let me just go up there for now.

287
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:29,580
- Find your balance.
- Support him on either side.

288
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:33,910
Grab his feet, and support Kwang Soo.

289
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:37,190
- Okay, we just have to succeed now.
- Pull it out.

290
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:42,300
- Down push, or shove it.
- Stop talking and just do it!

291
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:47,300
- Grab my ankles!
- I'm about to start crying here.

292
00:16:48,530 --> 00:16:52,840
- Just pull it out.
- I don't think it's lose enough to pull out.

293
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:55,990
- I think we need to go back around.
- No.

294
00:16:56,530 --> 00:17:00,890
Stop talking so much back there,
and come over here and help us!

295
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:03,270
- We have to go back around.
- Someone hand me the stick.

296
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:06,400
- Jae Suk is the only one on that side.
- Hurry up and hand me the stick.

297
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:09,970
Can't we go for a different piece?

298
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:15,300
Why is he doing?
What is he doing up there now?

299
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,380
What are you doing?
What's this falling on my head?

300
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:18,860
[Something is falling down on their heads...]

301
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:20,220
What are you doing?

302
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:25,290
- Merry Christmas!
- Happy New Year!

303
00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:27,420
- What is this?
- What's he doing?

304
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:30,490
What is he doing up there?

305
00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:35,920
I almost got it.

306
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:39,130
- I think I got it.
- There's a heavy snowfall warning.

307
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:42,950
The snow is starting to gather
on the ground.

308
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:47,660
Don't make me laugh.
Stop making me laugh!

309
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:51,340
Jong Kook... I'm about to freeze to death
from all that snow down here.

310
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,900
I feel like I'm going to freeze to death.

311
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:56,560
It's a winter storm.
Escape and find shelter.

312
00:17:58,330 --> 00:18:01,450
[A project with no end in sight?]

313
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:05,870
[The human ladder is nearing the end
of his strength level.]

314
00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:08,090
My shoulders are about to break!

315
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:10,870
I can't do this anymore!

316
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:17,140
[Manager Kkuk continues to shower down the
snow without any intention of stepping down.]

317
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:19,450
Are you carving a sculpture up there?

318
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:23,570
- Half of it is out.
- I'm about to break.

319
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:26,390
Jong Kook struggling that much means that
it's really starting to get hard.

320
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:33,880
[The tower top is twisting around!]

321
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:38,260
[Extreme state of nervousness.]

322
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:40,610
I think you've got it.

323
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:44,120
[Careful... will he be able to pull it out?]

324
00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:49,180
Just pull it out!

325
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:52,580
[Please...]

326
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:56,240
[At last!]

327
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,930
[After all that work,
succeeds in freeing their 8th block!]

328
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,440
[Just the fact that they're still breathing
is agonizing enough for them.]

329
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,510
[Time to work on the mid to lower level,
and give themselves a little break.]

330
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:12,230
[Still only helping with overseeing others?]

331
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:19,150
[Onlooker Big-nose continues to nag them on
with his arms crossed over his chest.]

332
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:22,420
When I asked him why he has his arms crossed,
he told me it's because he's cold.

333
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:25,090
- How can you be cold?
- The rest of us are covered in sweat!

334
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:26,770
[Everyone else is covered in sweat...]

335
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:28,680
- You're sweating? Why?
- We're all sweating!

336
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:32,100
Be careful, Kwang Soo.

337
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:37,600
[Their goal is to get 24,
and they currently have 20.]

338
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,620
[Working on their 21st block.]

339
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,910
I got it!

340
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:47,470
[Hm...]

341
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:50,300
Wow, I can't believe we're going to
succeed this mission.

342
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:53,320
- This one is going to be easy as pie.
- That's going to be so easy!

343
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:55,140
That's going to be cake!

344
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:59,600
[Current count- 24 blocks,
including the piece of cake block!]

345
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:02,040
[The writers are starting to
show their nervousness.]

346
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:04,280
The writers' faces are getting red!

347
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:12,100
[Running Man members are already
in their celebration mode.]

348
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:18,810
Go on and keep taunting them.
I can see them getting annoyed!

349
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,350
[Succeeds pulling out
their 23rd block with ease.]

350
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:28,140
The writers are having an emergency meeting!

351
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:34,160
[The writers are having
an emergency meeting?]

352
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,860
They're having a meeting!

353
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:39,140
Having a meeting!
Having a meeting.

354
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:43,590
We're not having a meeting, we're discussing
how we can get you more running balls.

355
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:48,470
- Kwang Soo is up.
- You want this one, or the one up there?

356
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:50,590
I think this one is going to be really tough.

357
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:52,790
There's a lot of pressure on this one.

358
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:54,640
- Which one should I go for?
- I think the one up there will be better.

359
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,590
- The one up there?
- Go for the one on the left.

360
00:20:57,220 --> 00:21:00,660
- You can do this, Kwang Soo.
- It's all over if we fail this.

361
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:03,310
- This is all riding on you.
- We're not going to fail this.

362
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:07,100
We're going for the riskier one up there
to make it better for the writers.

363
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:09,370
- You guys do whatever you want.
- You're leaving it up to us?

364
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:11,300
Then why is your face getting all red?

365
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:14,590
- Your face is getting really red.
- You look very upset right now.

366
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:17,520
The writers are pretending to be okay!

367
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,620
You don't think...

368
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:22,560
[Could the entertainment god be smiling
down upon Kwang Soo during this mission too?]

369
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,860
Don't get greedy with this.
Just do what you need to do.

370
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:27,210
Don't get all greedy and
try to be overly entertaining.

371
00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:29,860
- Lee Kwang Soo!
- Hey, whose side are you on?

372
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:32,100
All the writers are
chanting your name right now.

373
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:37,400
[The success of their mission is
riding on Kwang Soo.]

374
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:40,350
Just pull this one out by tapping it lightly.

375
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:44,370
- Let's get this done.
- 15 running balls are riding on this.

376
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:45,980
[The fate of 15 running balls are riding on
Kwang Soo's shoulders.]

377
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:48,710
- Grab my hand.
- Grab his hand and do what he needs.

378
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:51,460
- Don't do anything funny.
- I'm going to stand up now.

379
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:55,970
[Will it be victory?
Or will be it pure comedy?]

380
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:59,050
- He's already up.
- I'm going to stand up now.

381
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:01,710
- Up a little bit more.
- Are you okay, Jong Kook?

382
00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:04,160
Will you be okay?
I need you to move up a little bit.

383
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:06,640
- You think this one is okay?
- That's really high up there.

384
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:11,170
[Going for their targeted Jenga piece.]

385
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:14,340
- No, no!
- I don't have a good feeling about this.

386
00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:19,220
[Everyone is extremely nervous.]

387
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:22,320
- Is it not going to work?
- Why are you touching that?

388
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:24,540
- Pull it out or not?
- Hurry.

389
00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:27,490
- I think it's going to work.
- I think he can do it.

390
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:33,090
[Just what will be the results?]

391
00:22:36,870 --> 00:22:40,130
[Succeeds the Jenga mission!
All 24 blocks are removed.]

392
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:52,330
[Darn...]

393
00:22:58,430 --> 00:23:01,050
- I can't believe we did it.
- All of our hard work paid off!

394
00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:03,800
That was a pretty easy mission.

395
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,990
- Let's play another round.
- No, forget it.

396
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:07,880
[Immediately proposes
another round of the mission.]

397
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,480
I propose that we play another round with
20 balls on the line this time.

398
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,990
- If you fail, you only get ten balls...
- No, we're not doing it then.

399
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:17,590
Why would we even do it then?
There's not enough in it for us.

400
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:20,710
Okay, then here's what we propose.

401
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:25,240
Pulling out five more blocks from
the way things currently stand.

402
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:27,330
We'll count it as a win if you can
pull out just five more right now.

403
00:23:27,330 --> 00:23:30,400
Then if we were to fail,
then we get 12?

404
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:35,080
[Taking it upon himself
to knock off a few balls?]

405
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,450
- What are you saying?
- Let's make it more entertaining.

406
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,540
We have to consider the writers' positions,
and try to make it interesting at least.

407
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:44,780
- That's too much.
- We may not even get to go home tonight.

408
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:49,580
- Then how about we go for ten?
- Ten is a bit too much.

409
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:51,810
I'll take the ten, and I offer nine.

410
00:23:51,810 --> 00:23:54,270
- I'll go down to 13.
- Okay, we'll take that.

411
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:57,480
13 if you fail, but 20 if you succeed.

412
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,680
[Take out five more blocks, and win 20,
or go down to 13.]

413
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,770
Hey, she's sleeping up there.

414
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:05,370
I can't believe she fell asleep up there.

415
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:15,530
[Blank Ji fell asleep while the rest were
negotiating the game.]

416
00:24:18,650 --> 00:24:21,620
Don't you think that we could call
'How Can This Be' for something like this?

417
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:28,970
[Took off the helmet to use as a pillow,
and sleeping like she's in her own home.]

418
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:32,720
- That's unbelievable.
- No matter how tired she is, how could she?

419
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,380
[Strong heart, Blank Ji.]

420
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:37,950
It's not even a solid tower,
but it's a tower missing its blocks.

421
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:40,040
How can she sleep on something like that?

422
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:42,020
- She really is something.
- Song Ji Hyo.

423
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:44,490
- She's not waking up.
- Then just leave her alone.

424
00:24:44,490 --> 00:24:46,100
Song Ji Hyo.

425
00:24:48,370 --> 00:24:49,870
Did you sleep well?

426
00:24:49,870 --> 00:24:54,560
- We're going to do this without the wire?
- Don't pretend you weren't asleep.

427
00:24:56,610 --> 00:24:58,840
Look at how unashamed she's acting.

428
00:24:59,450 --> 00:25:02,370
- You saw?
- What are you doing up there?

429
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:05,350
Let's just go on.
No need to drag this on anymore.

430
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:09,170
- We can do this.
- One, two, three. Challenge!

431
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,400
- Who wants to go first?
- I'll go first.

432
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:16,380
I'm going to kick it out.

433
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:19,300
- That's not easy.
- That's kind of stuck down there.

434
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:21,720
- Be careful.
- Let us know when it starts to shake.

435
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:30,400
Okay, we got it!

436
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,190
- Okay, I'm going next.
- Four more to go!

437
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:40,880
- How are you going to do that one?
- You have to punch it with all your might.

438
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:47,320
Hey, careful.

439
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:51,580
[Everyone is starting to freak out as
the tower starts to shake.]

440
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:54,540
- Hey, you have to come this way.
- Be careful.

441
00:25:57,940 --> 00:26:01,280
[The Jenga piece is stuck on tight...]

442
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:05,960
[Will they be able to free up the piece?]

443
00:26:07,910 --> 00:26:09,930
- Just pull it out.
- Pull it out.

444
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:14,230
[The whole tower sways!]

445
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:18,700
- Don't try to push it!
- Lift a little as you pull it out.

446
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:20,390
[Even more carefully.]

447
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:26,190
[Could've been big trouble!]

448
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:32,160
- It's really stuck on tight.
- Just pull it out quickly.

449
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:35,450
- Just pull it out.
- Just ease it out of there.

450
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:39,220
[Haroro is focusing all his
concentration on the piece.]

451
00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:42,240
We can go home nice and dry.

452
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,010
Sing me the song, Suk Jin.
I feel nervous about this.

453
00:26:47,970 --> 00:26:51,940
[With them cheering him on... he succeeds!]

454
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:55,460
[Three left to go of their bonus round.]

455
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:59,810
[Manager Kkuk's turn,
who's been born to play Human Jenga.]

456
00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:02,990
[Kkuk chooses to go for
the very bottom level of the tower.]

457
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:04,460
Careful.

458
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:07,230
- Okay, that's good.
- That's a very safe piece.

459
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:10,690
Okay, that looks good.

460
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:16,760
- Two more to go!
- Okay! We can do this!

461
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:20,520
- Which one are we going for now?
- The right one doesn't really matter.

462
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,900
The last person to go has to make sure
to be really cautious.

463
00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:28,890
[High up in the tower...]

464
00:27:30,670 --> 00:27:32,960
- He can't even reach up there.
- This is bad.

465
00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:36,240
[Actually climbing up the Jenga tower!]

466
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:40,820
Lift up my right foot.

467
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:46,880
- Are you okay?
- Be careful.

468
00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:50,740
- Make sure to hold onto me.
- Tap it out of there.

469
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:55,420
[Carefully tapping the Jenga piece
out of its spot.]

470
00:27:56,970 --> 00:27:59,650
[Blank Ji awaits with her breath held
on top of the Jenga tower.]

471
00:28:01,290 --> 00:28:03,800
[Pulled a good portion of the piece out.]

472
00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:07,090
Carefully.
Go to the side.

473
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:10,280
[Moving carefully around to knock
the rest of the piece out.]

474
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:15,440
- You just need to knock it out of there.
- Be careful.

475
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:18,480
- Keep it balanced, Ji Hyo.
- Grab tighter onto my feet.

476
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:22,830
[Ji Hyo's role is becoming ever more crucial
as the number of the pieces lessens.]

477
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:26,570
[It's almost out of there.]

478
00:28:33,150 --> 00:28:34,500
- It's okay.
- Just tap it out.

479
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:37,260
Okay!

480
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:39,890
[Finally knocks it out of there!]

481
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:44,430
- I'm so scared.
- We've got you, you're okay.

482
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:49,050
The writers are starting to get
scowls on their faces.

483
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,680
- I think that we're amazing.
- Which piece should I go for?

484
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:58,160
Go for this piece.

485
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:00,960
Come over to the right a bit, Ji Hyo.

486
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:03,950
[Ji Hyo needs to help find
the tower's balance first.]

487
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:09,220
- Okay, let's do this.
- And be careful.

488
00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:12,400
Take the stick up there with you
just in case.

489
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:16,550
Take it with you,
and if it seems really stuck

490
00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:19,880
then dig a small space on the bottom
to make a handle to pull it out by.

491
00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:23,790
- Okay, take this with you.
- That stick is our hope.

492
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,760
- Okay, stand up carefully.
- Am I good?

493
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:31,620
- This is all in your hands.
- Do I need to go on my tiptoe?

494
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:33,380
[That's the target piece!]

495
00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:36,820
I need the stick.

496
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:40,530
- Dig a groove?
- Yeah, you have to stab it.

497
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:45,390
[Ready to start making some snow.]

498
00:29:48,490 --> 00:29:50,140
Okay, you're getting it.

499
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:01,370
- Try putting your finger in there.
- Can you fit your finger in there?

500
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:06,250
[Completely covered up in snow.]

501
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:08,090
- Are you sure that this is how I do it?
- Yeah, just pull it out now.

502
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:10,750
[Finally attempts to remove the piece.]

503
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:18,030
- I think this is going to work.
- Ji Hyo!

504
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:21,730
- You have to keep the balance!
- Okay, that looks good.

505
00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:24,710
- To the right a bit.
- Ji Hyo has to keep the balance.

506
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:32,060
[Sticking his finger in
the self-made handle...]

507
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:40,160
[Just a little bit more...]

508
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:44,340
[Will they get it?]

509
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:50,200
[Will they pull out the final piece without
making the tower crumble down in pieces?]

510
00:30:57,820 --> 00:31:00,940
[He did it!]

511
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:07,580
[The tower must stand for five seconds
after Kwang Soo is back on the ground.]

512
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:17,390
[Succeeds the bonus mission!]

513
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:28,980
You did great!

514
00:31:30,050 --> 00:31:32,820
[A round of applause for Ji Hyo as well for
doing a great job up on the tower.]

515
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:34,810
Thank you.
You sure 20 isn't too many?

516
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:36,890
[20 running balls as promised.]

517
00:31:45,330 --> 00:31:47,880
- Aren't you scared up there, Ji Hyo?
- Are you not even scared?

518
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:50,890
- Does not that even scare you?
- How is she okay with that?

519
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:55,820
Okay, let's go.

520
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:59,570
I don't know what the writers have in store
for us on such a cold day as this.

521
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:05,100
We're off to a really good start.

522
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:09,530
- Great job, everyone!
- We're awesome when we work together.

523
00:32:09,530 --> 00:32:13,030
When we work as a team,
we all know what our own specific roles are.

524
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:15,300
We're like the earth.

525
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:19,990
[Like different elements of the earth?]

526
00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:23,070
[Like the water, like the cloud,
like the wind...]

527
00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:25,330
Then I'm the star.

528
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:28,180
I wonder what they have in store for us now.

529
00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:30,950
- Is that our van?
- I see the cameras.

530
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:34,090
[A camera on top of the bridge?]

531
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:37,900
[Hm... the next mission looks
pretty challenging as well?]

532
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:39,410
I wonder why they're standing out there
on top of the bridge.

533
00:32:39,410 --> 00:32:41,640
[The fact that they're on
top of the bridge...]

534
00:32:44,050 --> 00:32:46,040
- What is this?
- Isn't this the Han River?

535
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:48,740
[Not a very good feeling about this...]

536
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:52,440
[Location- Han River Observation Deck.]

537
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:54,630
What are we doing here at Han River?

538
00:32:54,630 --> 00:32:57,140
- I see a stage.
- I see some sort of a stage.

539
00:32:57,140 --> 00:32:58,260
Are we going in the water?

540
00:32:58,260 --> 00:32:59,790
- What is that?
- It's boxes!

541
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:04,770
[Box, tape, tools-
They can't be serious...]

542
00:33:04,770 --> 00:33:06,970
They're not expecting us to cross
the Han River, are they?

543
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:11,910
Come on, no way!

544
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:14,260
- That's ridiculous.
- This is just absurd.

545
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:18,070
[Entering the stage with apprehension.]

546
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:20,180
Didn't you see the cameras
on top of the bridge earlier?

547
00:33:20,670 --> 00:33:24,220
[The cameras... They can't really mean...]

548
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:26,170
They really expect us to cross
the Han River?

549
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:29,830
[Their worst nightmare come true.]

550
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,120
[What is the fate that awaits them?]

551
00:33:35,890 --> 00:33:38,290
- Are we doing something on the Han River?
- This is absurd.

552
00:33:38,290 --> 00:33:41,840
It's time for you to cross the Han River
on board your paper boat.

553
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:44,910
You have to cross the Han River
in the paper boat.

554
00:33:44,910 --> 00:33:47,070
[Reacts vehemently as soon as
they hear their next mission.]

555
00:33:47,070 --> 00:33:50,350
- You have to cross the Han River.
- Han River is ridiculous.

556
00:33:50,350 --> 00:33:54,970
- We did a simulation this morning.
- Look at how strong the currents are.

557
00:33:54,970 --> 00:33:58,920
Since there are seven of you,
you can divide into groups of four and three.

558
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,920
You'll be given 30 minutes.

559
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:04,310
If both the boats can cross the river
within 30 minutes

560
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:06,950
then you'll be given 15 running balls.

561
00:34:06,990 --> 00:34:11,100
But if only one of the two boats makes it
in that 30 minutes, then you only get ten.

562
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:15,970
If even one boat makes it across past the
time limit, then you get five balls.

563
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:18,220
If both boats capsizes, then you get nothing.

564
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:19,480
There's another option.

565
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:23,030
If even a single boat makes it across within
25 minutes, then you'll get 20 balls.

566
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:25,750
We said we didn't want water games,
so why are we doing a water game?

567
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:31,150
But if we make our boat like Jung Chi and
Jung In did, then we may be able to make it.

568
00:34:31,150 --> 00:34:33,890
But I really want to recommend that
just a plain raft is the way to go.

569
00:34:33,890 --> 00:34:39,060
But if we make a boat like Jae Suk did,
then we're going to capsize for sure.

570
00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:42,140
[If they make it like Jae Suk
and Kwang Gyu did...]

571
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:45,020
We've learned a few tricks since our last time,
so we may be able to do this well.

572
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:47,920
We've even prepared some snacks
for all of you to enjoy as well.

573
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:50,390
Enjoy your snacks while you work.

574
00:34:50,390 --> 00:34:54,180
We should listen to Gary's advice
about the raft.

575
00:34:54,590 --> 00:34:57,900
[Building the boats aside,
they're focusing on eating first?]

576
00:34:58,450 --> 00:35:01,520
- We're going to eat first.
- Your clock starts now.

577
00:35:01,530 --> 00:35:04,920
- What? Are you serious?
- Can't you give us time to eat first?

578
00:35:06,890 --> 00:35:10,350
[How are they going to make two boats to fit
three and four within an hour?]

579
00:35:10,350 --> 00:35:12,970
Look at that current.
That current is no joke.

580
00:35:12,970 --> 00:35:17,410
[Will their boats be able to cut through by
the knife-like winds and the strong currents?]

581
00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:19,510
Look over it to make sure that they
didn't put any holes in the boxes.

582
00:35:19,510 --> 00:35:22,590
[You really think that
the writers would do that?]

583
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:24,290
We have to remain alert.

584
00:35:24,290 --> 00:35:25,700
Let's look at this one first.

585
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:30,810
[The four person boat to carry-
Jae Suk, Jong Kook, Gary, and Kwang Soo.]

586
00:35:30,810 --> 00:35:32,590
That should be big enough
for all four of us to sit down, right?

587
00:35:32,590 --> 00:35:34,290
You don't' think that's too wide?

588
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:37,730
[Maybe they can build it within 25 minutes.
These aces seem to know their stuff.]

589
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:41,220
- The size of Gary's shadow.
- Then that's simple. Just pull it up.

590
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:42,790
Yeah, that sounds good.

591
00:35:42,790 --> 00:35:47,070
[As for this team, we can only hope-
The three person boat's strategizing time.]

592
00:35:47,570 --> 00:35:52,050
What if we did something like this?
This is the side view of the boat.

593
00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:54,760
[A former marine-
Big nosed Brother's blueprint.]

594
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:56,600
Think of how this will look
once the sides are stood up.

595
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:59,240
This won't take too long to build.

596
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:03,340
[Will they be able to build it like this?]

597
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:07,070
- We need to tape it on this side too.
- And get it on this side as well.

598
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:09,920
[Meanwhile, the Cruise Line Ship Team
seems to know exactly what they're doing.]

599
00:36:11,830 --> 00:36:13,060
And tape it like this.

600
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:15,140
You see this gap over here?

601
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:17,970
We should overlap these sides
so that there aren't any gaps.

602
00:36:17,970 --> 00:36:19,700
So that no water leaks in.

603
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:21,790
- Okay, I get it.
- And we're going to add another piece.

604
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:24,120
We're going to add another one there.
You know what I'm saying, right?

605
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:28,630
Yes.

606
00:36:29,310 --> 00:36:31,600
- Wait...
- What?

607
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:34,520
- What is it?
- I'm a member of this team too.

608
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:38,420
- I never said that you weren't.
- This isn't some dictatorship over here.

609
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:42,320
- I'm just making sure that we do it right.
- Seriously.

610
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:44,820
They are we done with shaping it?
Is this how the boat is going to look?

611
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:48,250
- There's no need for it to look pretty.
- How it looks isn't important.

612
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:50,980
- I believe that how it looks is important.
- We have to make it really waterproof.

613
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:52,910
If looks are so important to you,
then what's wrong with your face?

614
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:55,240
- How can you say something like that?
- Can you scold him for me?

615
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:58,330
[Is the Cruise Line Ship Team in danger
of in-house fighting?]

616
00:36:58,330 --> 00:37:00,740
- Teamwork is very important here.
- I know that.

617
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:03,540
- I want to let you know...
- Look at our teamwork.

618
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:05,770
Look at how well we're working together.

619
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:09,830
- What are you guys doing?
- What are you drawing down there?

620
00:37:09,830 --> 00:37:13,180
This is how Ji Hyo and I ended up making
our raft boat the last time.

621
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:15,510
- Because we were crunched for time.
- But remember what's important here.

622
00:37:15,510 --> 00:37:18,140
This team needs to make it across
without sinking for us to succeed.

623
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:21,970
- I made the model.
- Just go with the raft idea.

624
00:37:21,970 --> 00:37:26,630
But this cardboard is too thin
for you to be able to do that.

625
00:37:26,630 --> 00:37:30,030
- See? This looks like a boat.
- But you're forcing that into shape.

626
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:31,960
I'm telling you that this is going to work.

627
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:34,110
- See? It's perfect.
- Okay, let's start making it.

628
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:40,760
[They've agreed to go along with
Big-nosed Brother's plan...]

629
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:43,140
Let's fold it and see if it fits.

630
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:45,770
- Why does it have to look like a boat?
- I don't know why either!

631
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:51,170
What do you mean, overlap it?
The boat has a huge hole in it!

632
00:37:52,050 --> 00:37:55,590
- Why not just go for a plain box instead?
- Or how about a turtle boat?

633
00:37:57,670 --> 00:37:59,860
- How are you going to build it?
- We're ruined!

634
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:02,480
- No, this could work.
- This isn't what I had in mind.

635
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:08,020
[Big-nosed Brother in the end agrees to
try out Ha Ha's idea...]

636
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:12,400
Fold up the sides over here.
Are your legs okay?

637
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:16,500
See? Look at this.
Look at how simple this idea is.

638
00:38:16,870 --> 00:38:19,930
[It's already taking on the shape
of a boat...]

639
00:38:20,510 --> 00:38:22,590
Look at this, Suk Jin!

640
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:25,680
Suk Jin!
I said, take a look at this!

641
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,760
[They're already pretty much finished with
the boat as they go with Ha Ha's idea.]

642
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:34,750
- How is it being built so quickly?
- Just hold it like this.

643
00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:38,250
This looks better than my idea.
There won't be any leaks either.

644
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:40,790
- Get to work!
- Just hurry up and get to work!

645
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:46,470
- It feels really sturdy.
- Right?

646
00:38:46,470 --> 00:38:49,650
[Really starting to take shape.
Time to build it strong.]

647
00:38:49,650 --> 00:38:51,920
I'm getting a really good feeling about this.

648
00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:59,350
Have yourselves a hot cup of coffee
while you work.

649
00:38:59,350 --> 00:39:01,220
Is there any caramel macchiato?

650
00:39:05,790 --> 00:39:08,070
- Come hold this! Gary!
- Yes, Sir!

651
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:13,670
[Even the Giraffe is taking out the time
to take a sip of his coffee.]

652
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:17,080
- Kwang Soo.
- I said, grab this part!

653
00:39:17,090 --> 00:39:18,930
- Kwang Soo!
- Grab it!

654
00:39:19,750 --> 00:39:21,600
This is really hot!

655
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:25,000
You don't think we're thirsty either?
You want a drink of the Han River?

656
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:29,280
[A stern warning.]

657
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,580
- I'm sorry!
- This is looking pretty good.

658
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:34,200
[A nice wrapping job to make sure
that there won't be any leaks.]

659
00:39:34,210 --> 00:39:40,410
[Planning to build onto the boat to help
increase its buoyancy.]

660
00:39:40,410 --> 00:39:42,710
Then you want us to put something
inside the box?

661
00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:44,910
Okay, I got it.

662
00:39:44,910 --> 00:39:49,030
[The boat building project
is really starting to pick up speed.]

663
00:39:49,850 --> 00:39:53,680
[Will they be able to safely cross
the river in those boats?]

664
00:39:54,250 --> 00:39:57,440
[Only 13 minutes left on the clock.]

665
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,850
Get out of the way!

666
00:39:58,850 --> 00:40:03,780
[Great idea- Attaching the box under the boat
to help increase its buoyancy.]

667
00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:09,770
Wow, this is a real workout.

668
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:14,230
- Yes, we'd appreciate that.
- We just want someone to help with taping.

669
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:18,050
- But you have to adhere to the time limit.
- Yes, of course.

670
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:21,360
Grab it down here.

671
00:40:24,050 --> 00:40:26,310
Wow, that's unbelievable.

672
00:40:26,310 --> 00:40:31,800
[Finishes it up within a blink of an eye
with the help from a crewmember.]

673
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:35,070
Just keep going.

674
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:38,280
We have to make sure
that it's really taped well.

675
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:40,420
Well, this is really on there.

676
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:42,370
[Well-made buoyancy boat.]

677
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:45,420
Are we really going to be
able to cross the Han River?

678
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:48,420
If this won't get us across,
then nothing will.

679
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:51,330
I was just joking about it, but I
can't believe we're really doing this.

680
00:40:51,330 --> 00:40:54,850
I know that I've seen someone crossing
the Han River on TV years ago

681
00:40:54,850 --> 00:40:56,710
but I never knew that I'd be the one
to attempt it too.

682
00:40:58,340 --> 00:41:02,280
[Just who will be the ones to really
cross this giant expanse of the river?]

683
00:41:02,730 --> 00:41:04,840
Okay, let's lift it up.

684
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:07,090
Wrap it around like this.

685
00:41:07,090 --> 00:41:11,270
We're going to build a raft and attach
our boat to the raft.

686
00:41:11,270 --> 00:41:13,910
[Plan is to attach
two separate boats together.]

687
00:41:13,910 --> 00:41:17,540
Can you lend us a pair of hands since
Ji Hyo's not strong enough to do all this?

688
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:20,360
Can one of the staff members come help?

689
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:25,440
[Ji Hyo's strong manager steps in to help.]

690
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,280
I'm fine.
Just help them with that.

691
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:32,920
[They're picking up speed on their project.]

692
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:35,230
- Make sure there's no room for leaks.
- Don't give up. We can do this.

693
00:41:35,230 --> 00:41:36,900
We can make this float.

694
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:42,400
[The three member team that had some trouble
in their designing phase, will they make it?]

695
00:41:43,530 --> 00:41:45,520
Are you making cotton candy or something?

696
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:48,180
- How are you going to get in that?
- Is that a coffin?

697
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:50,280
- What is that?
- Suk Jin did it.

698
00:41:50,290 --> 00:41:52,350
- What are you doing?
- How are you going to get in that thing?

699
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:55,090
There's not much time.

700
00:41:56,050 --> 00:41:58,380
This is ridiculous.

701
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:01,240
[The more they build,
the more ridiculous it's becoming.]

702
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:02,420
This really is absurd.

703
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:06,070
How are you going to cross the Han River?
That's no small creek to cross.

704
00:42:06,070 --> 00:42:09,510
[The idea of crossing the Han River
in a boat like that...]

705
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:17,530
[It'll be a shock to just see it float on top
of the water from a quick glance at the boat.]

706
00:42:18,170 --> 00:42:19,830
Just keep wrapping it.

707
00:42:23,790 --> 00:42:26,560
This looks like a battle ship.

708
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:30,470
[The four person boat is complete!]

709
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:36,520
[The team's hope may have to
ride on these four men.]

710
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:39,580
[Time's up!]

711
00:42:39,580 --> 00:42:45,500
[Time to face the river...]

712
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:49,190
Let's try sitting in it first.

713
00:42:51,790 --> 00:42:56,140
Ji Hyo, I just want you to go from side
to side and keep the boat balanced.

714
00:42:56,140 --> 00:43:00,890
If it seems it's leaning too much one way,
then you paddle from the opposite side.

715
00:43:00,890 --> 00:43:03,930
[They have to make sure to be in sync to
battle the strong winds and the current.]

716
00:43:03,930 --> 00:43:06,460
We need to think of the water
like it's the sand.

717
00:43:08,750 --> 00:43:13,800
[The four men team must paddle in sync!]

718
00:43:15,930 --> 00:43:18,520
To be honest... we should
leave the speed to the other team.

719
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:20,590
We should just focus on finishing the race.

720
00:43:23,390 --> 00:43:25,160
I don't know if I can even lift this.

721
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:31,230
[Time to make history!]

722
00:43:31,230 --> 00:43:34,370
[They're going to attempt to cross the river!]

723
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:42,100
[The four person boat is proving to be
quite heavy in its weight.]

724
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:47,750
Fighting!

725
00:43:48,190 --> 00:43:51,070
- Cross all the way to the other side?
- Is that even possible?

726
00:43:51,070 --> 00:43:52,730
Is it even possible to cross?

727
00:43:52,730 --> 00:44:01,460
[Will they be able to cross...
the whole river in their boats?]

728
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:11,930
[Yoo Hyuk, Mr. Capable, Giraffe, Mr. Gary.]

729
00:44:11,930 --> 00:44:14,010
[F4?
Four men Running Boat.]

730
00:44:14,010 --> 00:44:16,930
[And another team.]

731
00:44:16,930 --> 00:44:18,920
[Big-nose, Ace, Haroro.]

732
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:21,020
[Three person... life raft?]

733
00:44:21,020 --> 00:44:26,150
[Must cross the Han River to
earn your next set of running balls!]

734
00:44:26,150 --> 00:44:28,980
[Their start is looming.]

735
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:33,150
- Fighting!
- Fighting!

736
00:44:33,150 --> 00:44:34,770
[Everyone's cheering each other on.]

737
00:44:40,190 --> 00:44:46,950
[Must pull the finish flag on the other side
of the river to succeed the mission.]

738
00:44:46,950 --> 00:44:50,320
- We have to paddle in sync.
- I hope we don't sink right away.

739
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:53,650
[Will their boat even float?]

740
00:44:55,060 --> 00:45:00,500
[Even the slightest move off balance
might capsize the boat.]

741
00:45:02,620 --> 00:45:08,400
[Both teams are now ready... Go!]

742
00:45:18,740 --> 00:45:20,630
[It's floating!]

743
00:45:20,630 --> 00:45:23,540
[Wow- It's actually floating!]

744
00:45:23,540 --> 00:45:25,220
Okay, let's go!

745
00:45:25,970 --> 00:45:29,210
[The three person boat is floating
lightly on the water.]

746
00:45:29,210 --> 00:45:31,250
Off to the right a bit.
Okay, here we go.

747
00:45:31,250 --> 00:45:33,610
Paddle to the right.

748
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:38,100
[Off on the Han River... with confidence!]

749
00:45:40,620 --> 00:45:45,200
[The two boats have to be extra cautious
as they start off on their adventure!]

750
00:45:47,910 --> 00:45:51,500
One, two!
One, two!

751
00:45:56,990 --> 00:46:00,310
[Cross the river in 25 minutes or less,
and win 25 running balls!]

752
00:46:00,530 --> 00:46:06,450
[The two boats are finally headed
into the heart of the Han river!]

753
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:17,150
[Kwang Soo's boat.]

754
00:46:20,390 --> 00:46:23,970
[The crew of these two boats are keeping their
focus to steadily make their way forward!]

755
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:27,850
- Row on the right side, Suk Jin.
- Help row to the right, Ji Hyo.

756
00:46:27,850 --> 00:46:30,000
[The boat is starting to drift away!
Ha Ha gives out emergency instructions.]

757
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:37,300
[Even though the pace may be slow,
the boats are definitely moving forward!]

758
00:46:38,140 --> 00:46:40,550
We're going to earn our balls.
This is unbelievable.

759
00:46:44,590 --> 00:46:48,560
[The tough challenge that seemed
impossible in the beginning...]

760
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:54,980
[Not a single person who can help,
or a single person for them to lean on.]

761
00:46:56,240 --> 00:47:02,500
[Only the comrades that they're with.]

762
00:47:08,380 --> 00:47:15,470
[Both boats are headed
towards the finish line.]

763
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:27,810
[The four person boats forges ahead
under the direction of Yoo Hyuk.]

764
00:47:27,810 --> 00:47:29,780
Paddle to the right.

765
00:47:34,210 --> 00:47:37,300
[With the strong and icy winter winds...]

766
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:43,290
[The boat keeps swerving in other direction
no matter how straight they try to row it.]

767
00:47:43,290 --> 00:47:44,670
We can do this.

768
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:47,400
Don't give up.

769
00:47:48,340 --> 00:47:53,830
[Even the three person boat with all
their early troubles seems to be doing well.]

770
00:47:53,830 --> 00:47:55,760
Paddle deep.

771
00:47:56,750 --> 00:48:03,190
[On the other hand, the other boat is
forging ahead like a well-built tank.]

772
00:48:09,140 --> 00:48:13,280
[Captain Yoo Hyuk instructs them to change
the direction of their paddling.]

773
00:48:22,780 --> 00:48:24,630
Careful.

774
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:34,310
No!
No way!

775
00:48:35,570 --> 00:48:38,940
[F4 is in danger of capsizing!]

776
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:43,810
[Will they be able to right the boat again?]

777
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:50,860
[F4 members overboard!]

778
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:57,520
They fell in the water.

779
00:48:58,160 --> 00:48:59,840
The boat capsized.

780
00:49:00,190 --> 00:49:07,330
[They lost their balance while trying to
change the direction of their rowing.]

781
00:49:07,330 --> 00:49:09,240
No!
No way!

782
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:13,110
[How can this be...]

783
00:49:14,100 --> 00:49:17,260
[The unbelievably cold temperature of
the December waters!]

784
00:49:17,260 --> 00:49:20,090
[Automatically screams out
in pain from the icy waters.]

785
00:49:23,430 --> 00:49:29,190
[The rescue crew on standby
comes to their aid.]

786
00:49:30,990 --> 00:49:35,810
[The boat is completely flipped over.]

787
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:44,710
[Calmly fishing out one person at a time.]

788
00:49:49,390 --> 00:49:53,780
[All members are safely
pulled aboard the rescue raft.]

789
00:49:54,740 --> 00:49:56,690
Are you okay?

790
00:49:58,210 --> 00:50:02,680
[Is this the end of the F4's capsized boat?]

791
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:06,450
[Meanwhile]

792
00:50:06,450 --> 00:50:12,090
[The other boat is shockingly still afloat
and forging on ahead.]

793
00:50:12,870 --> 00:50:16,590
[Captain Ha Ha is remaining focused,
and forging his team ahead.]

794
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:22,780
[This small boat is the Running Man Team's
only remaining hope.]

795
00:50:24,890 --> 00:50:27,360
This is unbelievable, Suk Jin.
We're the aces of the team.

796
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:31,050
[Is he serious?]

797
00:50:31,790 --> 00:50:38,570
[If they can only make it across
without capsizing the boat...]

798
00:50:40,250 --> 00:50:44,290
[The F4 members make it safely back
to shore on their rescue boat.]

799
00:50:48,810 --> 00:50:53,060
[They thought they could succeed
without even a doubt in their minds.]

800
00:50:53,060 --> 00:50:57,010
I told you that we should make it wider.
You should've listened to me!

801
00:50:57,010 --> 00:51:00,880
But having the boat sit up that high
was tough for us to keep our balance.

802
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:05,240
That really took me by surprise.
And that water is shockingly cold!

803
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:08,950
[The water is colder than they had
ever even anticipated.]

804
00:51:08,950 --> 00:51:14,790
[But... will they be able to take
that boat back out into the water?]

805
00:51:14,790 --> 00:51:18,350
Ten minutes and ten seconds
have currently passed.

806
00:51:18,350 --> 00:51:20,220
Do you want try going across
in this boat again

807
00:51:20,220 --> 00:51:23,040
or do you want to drive across to the
other side and cheer the other team on?

808
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:25,210
You have to make your decision right now.

809
00:51:25,210 --> 00:51:30,070
[The decision is up to these four men!]

810
00:51:31,060 --> 00:51:38,570
[Will they make another attempt in this boat,
or give up going across the river?]

811
00:51:38,570 --> 00:51:40,640
Let's try it again.

812
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:44,740
[F4 suggests making another attempt
at crossing the river!]

813
00:51:49,310 --> 00:51:51,030
One, two, three!

814
00:51:53,100 --> 00:51:59,420
[In the boat they worked so hard to build...
they will make another attempt!]

815
00:51:59,420 --> 00:52:04,630
[But what kind of a condition
will their capsized boat be in?]

816
00:52:13,660 --> 00:52:18,820
[The boat seems to be completely ruined
from having been capsized in the water.]

817
00:52:18,820 --> 00:52:22,500
How about we rip out the top part,
and go on just the raft alone?

818
00:52:22,510 --> 00:52:27,360
[Rip off the top portion,
and just go on the bottom raft portion.]

819
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:30,390
- Let's just go on the bottom part.
- Should we just go on the bottom portion?

820
00:52:31,050 --> 00:52:33,010
- Let's make one more attempt.
- You think it'll be okay?

821
00:52:33,010 --> 00:52:35,940
- Should we just go change out pants?
- I'm not sure that you have the time for it.

822
00:52:37,250 --> 00:52:39,590
- Let's just go.
- If we fall in the water again...

823
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:45,300
[There's nothing left to lose!
One last attempt to make it across!]

824
00:52:45,820 --> 00:52:49,190
[Meanwhile]

825
00:52:49,190 --> 00:52:53,120
[The other boat is still steadily
making its way across the river.]

826
00:52:55,780 --> 00:53:00,190
[Hardworking and focused Captain Haroro.]

827
00:53:01,510 --> 00:53:06,140
[The earlier scene of them bickering
while building the boat is long gone.]

828
00:53:06,140 --> 00:53:13,240
[Even though they've still got a ways to go,
they're full of their fighting spirit!]

829
00:53:17,140 --> 00:53:19,100
Out boat is so sturdy and strong.

830
00:53:22,180 --> 00:53:24,170
I'm proud of us.

831
00:53:25,410 --> 00:53:27,230
Let's finish this race.

832
00:53:27,230 --> 00:53:29,810
I know it's exhausting, but
keep your focus.

833
00:53:29,810 --> 00:53:32,390
- Keep your eyes ahead.
- Let's finish this.

834
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:36,820
We're almost there.

835
00:53:36,820 --> 00:53:41,030
[Captain Haroro is continuing
to cheer on his team members.]

836
00:53:41,710 --> 00:53:48,000
[Will this boat be able to last
across to the finish line?]

837
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,560
Let's try it.
Let's cheer up and see if we can make it.

838
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:54,600
My guess is...
88% guaranteed that we'll sink.

839
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:58,150
I can't fall back in that water again.

840
00:53:58,150 --> 00:54:00,350
[They now know what it's like to
fall into that icy water.]

841
00:54:02,020 --> 00:54:06,610
[Making another attempt without the top part,
and just on the life raft portion.]

842
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:10,820
[Just seeing the water alone is enough
to make them quake in fear.]

843
00:54:11,810 --> 00:54:13,660
Okay, let's go.
Let's remain strong.

844
00:54:14,780 --> 00:54:16,460
So cold!

845
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:20,750
Okay, we're good.
We're steadier than we were before.

846
00:54:22,670 --> 00:54:26,340
[Another gauntlet is thrown at the river.]

847
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:33,610
[Deep and strong paddles.]

848
00:54:36,210 --> 00:54:41,660
[And move forward.]

849
00:54:46,450 --> 00:54:52,810
[Even though their boat may be ruined,
their will is stronger than ever!]

850
00:54:55,250 --> 00:55:01,460
[Their teamwork is rowing the boat
is even stronger than before.]

851
00:55:08,630 --> 00:55:12,480
[The voyage of F4 starts now!]

852
00:55:14,260 --> 00:55:15,790
This is good.

853
00:55:24,710 --> 00:55:26,470
A little bit to the right.

854
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:34,280
[Keep up this pace, and their only problem
would be the matter of time.]

855
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:45,960
Look at that wave!
It's coming our way.

856
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:48,470
[Wave?]

857
00:55:48,470 --> 00:55:51,220
[Wave!]

858
00:55:55,820 --> 00:55:59,490
[A giant wave is headed their way!]

859
00:55:59,830 --> 00:56:03,160
- Loosen up your limbs.
- Don't tighten up your bodies!

860
00:56:08,410 --> 00:56:15,400
[They already fell in the water earlier...
Fall again, and they're done for!]

861
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:21,610
[Here it comes!]

862
00:56:34,410 --> 00:56:36,820
[Extreme state of nervousness.]

863
00:56:37,870 --> 00:56:40,710
Let's go again!
Here we go!

864
00:56:40,710 --> 00:56:43,440
[Head off again once the wave passes.]

865
00:56:49,300 --> 00:56:51,890
Let's go!
Please!

866
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:57,500
Running Man!
Going on four years now!

867
00:56:57,880 --> 00:57:01,450
Even though we've been ignored
and disrespected all this time...

868
00:57:02,780 --> 00:57:05,800
but we've endured all those years
to show them this moment.

869
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:07,880
We're not traitors.

870
00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:10,560
We're married men now!

871
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:16,340
Can you get me some water, Ji Hyo?

872
00:57:18,410 --> 00:57:23,960
[They're all like one big family
in their little boat.]

873
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:28,980
Suk Jin. Let's think of this as being our
only means of seeing our family again.

874
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:32,220
I'm going to be a father
that my baby can be proud of!

875
00:57:32,220 --> 00:57:35,100
Dream!
Daddy is coming!

876
00:57:39,230 --> 00:57:41,970
Hyun Woo!
Dad is coming!

877
00:57:41,970 --> 00:57:44,400
Hyun Woo!
Uncle is coming too!

878
00:57:44,410 --> 00:57:47,010
I love you, mom and dad!

879
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:51,250
Let's have another baby, honey!

880
00:57:52,010 --> 00:57:54,750
Let's have a second baby too, honey!

881
00:57:56,630 --> 00:58:01,620
[Crossing the Han River with their
determination to get back to their families.]

882
00:58:07,740 --> 00:58:12,880
[F4 members are struggling even more
ever since having fallen in the water.]

883
00:58:14,410 --> 00:58:17,390
Who would've ever thought that I'd be
trying to cross the Han river like this?

884
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:20,730
Everyone... you're all tired, aren't you?

885
00:58:22,140 --> 00:58:23,880
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

886
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:26,180
We could pull you the rest of the way
if you just want to give up.

887
00:58:26,180 --> 00:58:28,270
No, we're going to finish ourselves.

888
00:58:28,270 --> 00:58:30,110
[Insisting on crossing the river themselves.]

889
00:58:30,110 --> 00:58:32,280
We're going to finish this ourselves!

890
00:58:33,690 --> 00:58:36,940
- We love everyone!
- Let's stay strong.

891
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:46,330
[The other team is already near
the water fountain.]

892
00:58:49,340 --> 00:58:51,280
We're going to finish this.

893
00:58:54,310 --> 00:58:56,750
We can finish this in five minutes.
Let's stay determined and finish this!

894
00:59:03,150 --> 00:59:09,030
[Picking up the speed to forge
full speed ahead!]

895
00:59:12,830 --> 00:59:16,860
[Even though they're exhausted,
their teamwork is better than ever!]

896
00:59:19,770 --> 00:59:21,260
We're moving at a good speed!

897
00:59:23,070 --> 00:59:25,880
[Perfectly in sync.]

898
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:28,590
We'll show them that we're not the bottom,
but that we're the foundation of this team!

899
00:59:33,060 --> 00:59:35,620
We're almost there!
Stay focused!

900
00:59:36,650 --> 00:59:40,450
[Their strength is diminishing...]

901
00:59:40,450 --> 00:59:46,050
[It really is down to
the final spurt of energy!]

902
00:59:47,950 --> 00:59:49,870
Let's pick up the speed.

903
00:59:51,450 --> 00:59:53,160
We have to pull the flag.

904
00:59:55,920 --> 01:00:02,190
[The shore... really is
right in front of their eyes now.]

905
01:00:06,660 --> 01:00:10,070
[About to land!]

906
01:00:12,180 --> 01:00:15,300
[Pulling out the flag
is the most crucial part!]

907
01:00:17,730 --> 01:00:22,390
[Ace Ji Hyo runs full speed ahead
towards the flag!]

908
01:00:23,320 --> 01:00:30,220
[And their time?
And how many balls will they earn?]

909
01:00:39,100 --> 01:00:43,980
[Succeeds in crossing the Han River
in their paper boat!]

910
01:00:49,070 --> 01:00:54,990
[The time is still unknown...]

911
01:00:58,860 --> 01:01:00,440
Wow, we really did it.

912
01:01:01,970 --> 01:01:07,140
[Really did cross the river
in their paper boat.]

913
01:01:09,110 --> 01:01:12,340
- We'll reveal your finish time.
- Get up, Dong Hoon.

914
01:01:13,210 --> 01:01:19,330
[Haroro stepped up to the plate
as the captain of their boat.]

915
01:01:19,330 --> 01:01:21,350
I'm really impressed by what we did.

916
01:01:23,740 --> 01:01:28,810
[A moment where no words are necessary.]

917
01:01:28,810 --> 01:01:30,890
Okay, everyone.

918
01:01:30,890 --> 01:01:32,680
Here's your time.

919
01:01:32,680 --> 01:01:36,800
I told you that you'll earn ten balls
if one boat arrives within 30 minutes.

920
01:01:37,260 --> 01:01:41,650
One boat did succeed in making it to shore
within 30 minutes.

921
01:01:41,650 --> 01:01:45,360
[One boats succeeds in landing in 30 minutes-
Ten running balls are earned.]

922
01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:50,320
[Made their way across the whole river
in that flimsy boat.]

923
01:01:50,320 --> 01:01:55,360
[If even one boat makes it within 25 minutes,
then 20 balls are won as a bonus.]

924
01:01:55,360 --> 01:02:06,030
[Their finish time is...]

925
01:02:06,030 --> 01:02:07,670
20 minutes and 39 seconds!

926
01:02:07,670 --> 01:02:09,940
[Unbelievable!
20 minutes and 39 seconds!]

927
01:02:09,940 --> 01:02:14,800
[Under 20 minutes!
20 running balls are earned!]

928
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:17,460
- We made it in 20 minutes!
- Unreal!

929
01:02:17,460 --> 01:02:22,480
[Emotional over their huge success.]

930
01:02:23,570 --> 01:02:25,440
You saw that, right?
You saw that?

931
01:02:28,070 --> 01:02:33,270
[Well deserved after
all their unyielding hard work.]

932
01:02:39,390 --> 01:02:44,920
[Emotional from succeeding
this almost impossible mission.]

933
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:46,310
- Unbelievable.
- This is amazing.

934
01:02:46,310 --> 01:02:48,200
Let's take a picture.

935
01:02:48,850 --> 01:02:51,850
[Everyone thought that they'd fail...]

936
01:02:53,390 --> 01:02:54,570
[Picture of proof-
20 minutes and 39 seconds.]

937
01:02:54,570 --> 01:02:57,390
[Succeeds in crossing the Han River!]

938
01:02:59,590 --> 01:03:00,970
We did it!

939
01:03:00,970 --> 01:03:03,680
This means our skills have improved greatly
without us even realizing it.

940
01:03:03,690 --> 01:03:05,660
[No one even fathomed that they'd be able to
cross the river this quickly.]

941
01:03:05,670 --> 01:03:08,670
- I love you, mom and dad!
- We did it!

942
01:03:08,670 --> 01:03:13,210
- We love you!
- What a great start to 2014!

943
01:03:14,290 --> 01:03:15,980
I love you, my son!

944
01:03:15,990 --> 01:03:18,430
This is what you call real action!

945
01:03:21,170 --> 01:03:23,600
This is the first time I've ever
teared up like this during a show.

946
01:03:24,700 --> 01:03:26,530
This is unbelievable.

947
01:03:26,940 --> 01:03:28,600
I'm so emotional right now.

948
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:31,340
I love the fact that it was the
three of us that got it done.

949
01:03:32,120 --> 01:03:34,220
He's the designer.

950
01:03:34,220 --> 01:03:39,390
[It's now time to cheer on the others.]

951
01:03:45,770 --> 01:03:51,340
[Not giving up to the end.]

952
01:03:54,340 --> 01:04:00,980
[These men, enjoying this moment
of their challenge...]

953
01:04:06,260 --> 01:04:12,740
[These men, who know that giving up
is the real loss of the game...]

954
01:04:18,930 --> 01:04:21,370
I can't believe how close we are
to the water fountain.

955
01:04:22,300 --> 01:04:29,190
[The fountain that they've only seen from
atop the bridge is right in front of them.]

956
01:04:35,730 --> 01:04:40,620
[With fierce determination...]

957
01:04:44,340 --> 01:04:49,010
[With their trust only in each other...]

958
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:58,910
[Just like this one moment...]

959
01:05:00,330 --> 01:05:02,430
- They ripped off the top portion.
- They're crossing on the raft.

960
01:05:02,430 --> 01:05:05,510
- You guys are awesome!
- You're so awesome!

961
01:05:05,510 --> 01:05:07,990
You can do it!

962
01:05:25,550 --> 01:05:27,290
Just a little bit more!

963
01:05:27,290 --> 01:05:30,120
- One! Two!
- This is really amazing.

964
01:05:30,130 --> 01:05:34,300
In a paper boat... A paper boat that
we made. It's unbelievable.

965
01:05:34,300 --> 01:05:36,730
You're almost there!

966
01:05:36,730 --> 01:05:38,780
It's right in front of you now!

967
01:05:40,660 --> 01:05:43,150
You guys are awesome!
I'm proud of you guys!

968
01:05:43,150 --> 01:05:45,910
[Cheering each other on.]

969
01:05:47,550 --> 01:05:49,350
You're almost there.
You're really almost there.

970
01:05:49,350 --> 01:05:53,050
- One, two!
- Running Man, fighting!

971
01:05:54,450 --> 01:05:58,410
[They're almost at shore...]

972
01:05:58,410 --> 01:06:00,980
You guys ripped off the top
of your boat.

973
01:06:00,980 --> 01:06:05,360
[After rowing for so long,
their exhaustion can be seen in their faces.]

974
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:09,980
[The finish line is right
in front of their eyes.]

975
01:06:13,900 --> 01:06:16,020
Run!

976
01:06:16,870 --> 01:06:19,670
[Yoo Hyuk never gave up to the very end.]

977
01:06:22,060 --> 01:06:26,620
[Even though they don't know
how much time has passed...]

978
01:06:26,620 --> 01:06:30,690
[They still run over to the finish line...]

979
01:06:34,900 --> 01:06:40,860
[All the members sincerely cheering
each other on with all their hearts.]

980
01:06:42,600 --> 01:06:50,770
[Chilled down to their bones,
but kept warm with their own fervor.]

981
01:06:52,360 --> 01:06:56,910
[Running Man Han River Boat Challenge-
Success!]

982
01:06:57,690 --> 01:07:02,560
I can't help but be impressed by the
fighting spirit that you've all just shown.

983
01:07:03,430 --> 01:07:07,080
We're all shocked right now by
the fact that you've all succeeded.

984
01:07:07,720 --> 01:07:15,790
[Both boats succeeded in their mission-
What is F4's finishing time?]

985
01:07:15,790 --> 01:07:18,260
47 minutes and 32 seconds.

986
01:07:19,220 --> 01:07:21,410
47 minutes and 32 seconds.

987
01:07:21,410 --> 01:07:27,470
[The fact that they kept on rowing that
whole time without ever giving up...]

988
01:07:27,870 --> 01:07:30,220
The first team made it
in 20 minutes and 39 seconds.

989
01:07:31,610 --> 01:07:37,470
[20 minutes and 39 seconds-
20 running balls earned!]

990
01:07:42,890 --> 01:07:44,790
We all did it!

991
01:07:45,730 --> 01:07:52,740
[No matter who actually did it,
they all accomplished it together.]

992
01:08:10,660 --> 01:08:12,110
Please come this way.

993
01:08:13,130 --> 01:08:15,300
It's almost time for PD Myuk to
take a little plunge in the water.

994
01:08:17,440 --> 01:08:19,420
I can't believe I'm about to witness this
in my lifetime.

995
01:08:20,080 --> 01:08:22,320
When we were dumped in the river...

996
01:08:22,320 --> 01:08:24,390
I really wasn't going to say this.

997
01:08:24,390 --> 01:08:26,370
- But he really is no joke.
- Why?

998
01:08:26,370 --> 01:08:27,910
Look at the picture that he uploaded.

999
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:29,810
Why would you upload a picture
of a cup of coffee?

1000
01:08:29,810 --> 01:08:32,870
I got really bored while waiting
for you guys to get to the finish line.

1001
01:08:33,480 --> 01:08:35,760
You really are something else.

1002
01:08:35,770 --> 01:08:38,450
I really want to see him
get plunged in the water.

1003
01:08:38,450 --> 01:08:41,050
- I brought an extra set of underwear today.
- Seriously?

1004
01:08:41,400 --> 01:08:44,070
We always bring extra with us since
we never know what'll happen.

1005
01:08:44,070 --> 01:08:46,150
We already had to
change our underwear once.

1006
01:08:46,970 --> 01:08:51,140
We're about to start our last round of games.
All of you have worked really hard today.

1007
01:08:51,360 --> 01:08:53,950
Even though we don't know
what the results will be

1008
01:08:53,950 --> 01:08:56,940
the beauty of seeing how hard you're
working in the challenge against us

1009
01:08:56,940 --> 01:09:00,610
- I'd like to see...
- Did you say that this is our challenge?

1010
01:09:02,930 --> 01:09:04,850
Your final mission is...

1011
01:09:05,150 --> 01:09:07,420
Hongdae's Rhythmic Gymnastics.

1012
01:09:07,420 --> 01:09:09,660
- Hongdae's Rhythmic Gymnastics.
- What's that?

1013
01:09:09,660 --> 01:09:14,230
If you'll look outside,
you'll see a special set for the mission.

1014
01:09:14,230 --> 01:09:16,000
Rhythmic gymnastics?

1015
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:28,820
[The area is already full of spectators.]

1016
01:09:32,850 --> 01:09:38,220
[Seven Running Man members must do seven
different predetermined categories...]

1017
01:09:38,220 --> 01:09:42,050
[And complete the series of categories
within seven minutes to win.]

1018
01:09:42,420 --> 01:09:45,010
Seven minutes is going to be tough.

1019
01:09:54,210 --> 01:09:57,970
We've prepared a set of nice and warm
gymnastics outfits for all of you.

1020
01:09:57,970 --> 01:09:59,790
You call this nice?

1021
01:09:59,790 --> 01:10:03,100
You'll do the mission in a relay method
to complete it within seven minutes.

1022
01:10:03,620 --> 01:10:07,610
If you succeed with three attempts,
then you'll earn 15 running balls.

1023
01:10:07,610 --> 01:10:09,510
If you succeed within four attempts,
then you'll win 10 running balls.

1024
01:10:09,510 --> 01:10:12,090
But if you succeed within two attempts,
then we'll give you 20 balls.

1025
01:10:12,090 --> 01:10:14,200
We have to be very serious about this.

1026
01:10:14,200 --> 01:10:16,630
Can you give us just
three minutes to practice?

1027
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:19,910
- Since we've never done this before?
- That's an excellent suggestion, Ji Hyo.

1028
01:10:19,910 --> 01:10:22,470
If you'll give me two running balls...

1029
01:10:25,850 --> 01:10:28,340
I'm going to step outside
and think about the decision.

1030
01:10:29,280 --> 01:10:31,020
Can someone else take over for him?

1031
01:10:35,460 --> 01:10:38,320
- Send someone else in.
- Let's get PD Myuk today!

1032
01:10:38,320 --> 01:10:40,540
- Yes, let's do that.
- Let's seriously win today.

1033
01:10:40,540 --> 01:10:43,220
One, two, three.
Challenge.

1034
01:10:43,220 --> 01:10:45,390
[Hongdae's Rhythmic Gymnastics-
Challenge accepted.]

1035
01:10:45,390 --> 01:10:47,690
- Fighting.
- Fighting!

1036
01:10:47,690 --> 01:10:49,690
I'll go do it and be right back.

1037
01:10:52,540 --> 01:10:55,930
- I think she'll do really good.
- She's good at everything.

1038
01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:04,680
Ten hoola hoop jumps.

1039
01:11:04,680 --> 01:11:06,670
[Blank Ji- Ten jumps through the hoola hoop.]

1040
01:11:10,340 --> 01:11:12,750
[Oh... she's a good jumper!]

1041
01:11:14,200 --> 01:11:17,250
[She's doing so great!]

1042
01:11:17,250 --> 01:11:18,730
Ten!

1043
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:22,490
[Success!]

1044
01:11:25,610 --> 01:11:28,540
[Back to the second player!]

1045
01:11:30,990 --> 01:11:33,540
Okay, Gary.
Get it done.

1046
01:11:37,230 --> 01:11:39,400
[Second player, Gary,
is off to their special stage.]

1047
01:11:40,390 --> 01:11:42,850
[But their stomachs are feeling
a bit too full...]

1048
01:11:43,590 --> 01:11:45,500
Where?
Where do I go?

1049
01:11:55,260 --> 01:11:57,790
[That's hard...]

1050
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:02,080
What's wrong with this!

1051
01:12:03,060 --> 01:12:04,510
What's wrong with this!

1052
01:12:04,510 --> 01:12:06,320
- You have to go up a bit more.
- Up a bit?

1053
01:12:11,030 --> 01:12:13,660
[Will he catch it this time?]

1054
01:12:15,160 --> 01:12:17,130
[Ah... so close!]

1055
01:12:29,170 --> 01:12:31,210
[Finally succeeds!]

1056
01:12:31,980 --> 01:12:33,280
He got it!

1057
01:12:36,290 --> 01:12:37,860
- Jong Kook.
- That's our Gary!

1058
01:12:42,470 --> 01:12:43,720
Good job.

1059
01:12:44,170 --> 01:12:46,140
[Complete exhaustion.]

1060
01:12:47,770 --> 01:12:49,800
[Third player- Kkuk.]

1061
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:52,730
[The spectators burst out in laughter from
seeing how tight the uniform is on him.]

1062
01:12:53,710 --> 01:12:57,500
[Everyone starting to grumble
now that the Tiger is out of the den.]

1063
01:12:57,500 --> 01:13:00,110
- Left to right?
- You have to stay within the boundaries.

1064
01:13:00,110 --> 01:13:02,810
If your foot leaves that little mark,
then you fail the mission.

1065
01:13:04,890 --> 01:13:08,100
[Turn once to the left and once to the right
on one foot while twirling the ribbon.]

1066
01:13:19,580 --> 01:13:21,550
I got it, right?
How did I fail?

1067
01:13:21,550 --> 01:13:23,020
- You can't hop around.
- What!

1068
01:13:23,020 --> 01:13:24,510
There he goes getting angry again.

1069
01:13:24,510 --> 01:13:28,230
Why did he have to keep on insisting
to do that category?

1070
01:13:28,230 --> 01:13:31,650
- Why did he keep insisting on that one?
- I told him to do the dribble.

1071
01:13:33,970 --> 01:13:35,330
Okay, here I go.

1072
01:13:35,330 --> 01:13:36,850
[Second attempt.]

1073
01:13:42,450 --> 01:13:44,070
You're stepping on the ribbon!

1074
01:13:44,070 --> 01:13:45,770
[Fail]

1075
01:13:45,770 --> 01:13:49,470
[Failed thanks to a spectator
pointing out his mistake.]

1076
01:13:49,470 --> 01:13:51,130
There he goes getting angry again.

1077
01:14:00,140 --> 01:14:02,580
[That's one circle.]

1078
01:14:02,580 --> 01:14:04,480
[Back to the right now.]

1079
01:14:07,010 --> 01:14:08,910
[Success]

1080
01:14:09,850 --> 01:14:11,650
- Okay!
- Here I go.

1081
01:14:11,650 --> 01:14:14,340
[Time for Ha Ha's turn.]

1082
01:14:17,200 --> 01:14:19,450
You got that, right?

1083
01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:30,710
[Throw the three hoops and
jump over them in succession.]

1084
01:14:32,090 --> 01:14:34,110
[The hoop isn't rolling very well
on top of the mat.]

1085
01:14:39,700 --> 01:14:42,020
[Endures the painful agony...]

1086
01:14:44,540 --> 01:14:46,850
- Fighting!
- Fighting!

1087
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:49,360
He has to throw it further this time.

1088
01:14:50,700 --> 01:14:54,010
[He throws it far,
but success still eludes him.]

1089
01:14:57,020 --> 01:14:59,460
Why isn't this working?
Why!

1090
01:15:05,460 --> 01:15:07,630
[Yoo Hyuk- Bounce the table tennis ball
ten times on top of the club.]

1091
01:15:07,640 --> 01:15:08,820
Stay calm.

1092
01:15:12,030 --> 01:15:14,060
I'm trying to remain calm,
but it's not really working.

1093
01:15:17,370 --> 01:15:19,710
[The unpredictable table tennis ball.]

1094
01:15:20,790 --> 01:15:22,580
Ugh!
This is so frustrating!

1095
01:15:22,580 --> 01:15:24,240
Ugh!
This is seriously so frustrating!

1096
01:15:27,310 --> 01:15:29,480
[Big-nosed Brother's turn.]

1097
01:15:29,960 --> 01:15:32,550
[Bounce the ball five times on his shoulder.]

1098
01:15:33,770 --> 01:15:35,290
How am I supposed to do this?

1099
01:15:35,290 --> 01:15:37,250
I think he'll only succeed once
his shoulders stiffen up.

1100
01:15:40,340 --> 01:15:42,080
A round of applause!

1101
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:48,890
I did it!

1102
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:53,160
[Five shoulder bounces- Success!]

1103
01:15:58,300 --> 01:15:59,440
I did it.

1104
01:15:59,440 --> 01:16:02,390
[Time for Kwang Soo's turn.]

1105
01:16:02,390 --> 01:16:05,080
- I did it.
- I think today really is the day.

1106
01:16:12,410 --> 01:16:14,240
My long johns are really
keeping me warm.

1107
01:16:14,240 --> 01:16:16,010
[Throw the clubs into the air,
and catch it after two turns.]

1108
01:16:28,190 --> 01:16:31,080
- That's hard. That's really hard.
- Even a single spin is hard.

1109
01:16:39,340 --> 01:16:41,290
[Why is he stepping forward?]

1110
01:16:43,150 --> 01:16:45,890
[Ultimately ends up taking out his anger
out on PD Myuk.]

1111
01:16:47,280 --> 01:16:49,790
[First attempt- Fail.]

1112
01:16:52,540 --> 01:16:56,890
[Full of complaints over nitpicky judging.]

1113
01:16:58,830 --> 01:17:00,180
This is absurd.

1114
01:17:00,180 --> 01:17:02,390
I'm taking a very athletic approach
to this mission.

1115
01:17:03,500 --> 01:17:05,920
I don't think we'll be able to
succeed this mission.

1116
01:17:05,920 --> 01:17:07,300
[Unable to see the possibility
of them succeeding this mission.]

1117
01:17:07,300 --> 01:17:10,050
If you'll give me three running balls...

1118
01:17:10,050 --> 01:17:15,550
[Will adjust the most difficult category
at the cost of three running balls.]

1119
01:17:15,550 --> 01:17:17,420
Then reduce Kwang Soo's mission
to only a single spin.

1120
01:17:17,420 --> 01:17:19,220
[Asking to adjust Kwang Soo's mission
to only one singular spin.]

1121
01:17:24,590 --> 01:17:26,900
[Mr. Capable is easily able to
jump over the hoops.]

1122
01:17:27,570 --> 01:17:30,230
[Jong Kook and Ha Ha exchanging
their categories?]

1123
01:17:31,500 --> 01:17:33,880
Then you're going to give me
three of your running balls?

1124
01:17:33,880 --> 01:17:35,190
Yes, we will.

1125
01:17:36,350 --> 01:17:38,220
- Okay, fine.
- Then we'll do that.

1126
01:17:38,220 --> 01:17:42,330
If you succeed at your second attempt,
then you'll earn 20 running balls.

1127
01:17:42,340 --> 01:17:43,720
[20 balls if they succeed this time.]

1128

[Blank Ji succeeded her part in one try
during their first attempt.]

1131
01:18:06,100 --> 01:18:08,430
[Doing it just as well this time around.]

Okay, that's ten!
I got it!

1156
01:20:12,530 --> 01:20:15,450
[First of the four players
all passed their categories.]

1157

[Time for Kwang Soo's turn with
his newly adjusted category.]

1160

[He only needs to turn a singular turn
before he catches the clubs.]

1161
01:20:38,550 --> 01:20:40,230
[Success!]

1162
01:20:41,290 --> 01:20:42,440
He did it!

[Suk Jin's turn.]

1164
01:20:50,690 --> 01:20:52,910
- I feel so antsy.
- Fighting!

1165
01:20:54,760 --> 01:20:57,990
[Will he be able to succeed again this time?]

1166
01:21:01,110 --> 01:21:02,930
He looks like he's fencing.

1167
01:21:05,730 --> 01:21:07,470
[Oh?]

1168
01:21:11,690 --> 01:21:14,180
I did it, right?

1169
01:21:14,180 --> 01:21:16,630
[Another success!]

1170
01:21:17,170 --> 01:21:19,940

than anticipated!]

1171

succeed his category now.]

are really happy right now.

[Gary also succeeds!]

01:22:23,380 --> 01:22:26,400
[The time he arrives back on the second floor
is their completion time!]

[Did they succeed within seven minutes?]

but they're still feeling at ease.]

1194
01:23:19,410 --> 01:23:23,090
[SA long as they're at the ice cream shop...
Time to grab some ice cream!]

1196
01:23:34,010 --> 01:23:35,470
Things are going so well today.

1197
01:23:37,240 --> 01:23:42,120
If some other company asks us to compete
in some kind of a competition...

1198
01:23:43,150 --> 01:23:44,680
I'd bet that we'd pretty much win it.

1199
01:23:45,650 --> 01:23:48,660
[It's clear that RM members would have the
advantage from playing over 1,000 games.]

1200

Go get us our running balls.

a special guest MC.]

- We will now...

We will now hear the final verdict on 2013
year-end Running Man negotiations.

1209
01:24:25,810 --> 01:24:28,090
We will now start the verdict.

1210
01:24:28,090 --> 01:24:31,110
- You have 57 balls in your possession?
- Yes, that's correct.

1211
01:24:31,120 --> 01:24:33,150
- Please hand it over here.
- Yes, Sir.

1212
01:24:33,160 --> 01:24:37,380
[Team Running Man- A total of 57 balls.]

1213
01:24:38,110 --> 01:24:40,390

big enough for all those balls.

1214

[Team Running Man with
a huge stash of balls.]

1215

We have even more than that, don't we?

1216
01:24:45,660 --> 01:24:49,940
Just to assure fairness of the draw,
I will be making the draw myself.

1217
01:24:49,940 --> 01:24:54,460
I will proceed as I do every Saturday.

1218
01:24:55,570 --> 01:25:01,890
If the ball I draw is the Running Man ball,
then Team Running Man will win.

1219
01:25:01,900 --> 01:25:05,640
But if the Team Writers ball is drawn...

1220
01:25:05,640 --> 01:25:11,160
- Is it just going to be a single draw?
- One ball will determine who gets punished.

1221
01:25:12,160 --> 01:25:14,990
- We have twice the chance of winning.
- We have a pretty good chance.

1222
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:17,090
[It's all left up to chance.
It's up to the luck of the draw.]

1223
01:25:17,090 --> 01:25:19,940

1225
01:25:29,270 --> 01:25:31,220
I really don't want to get wet!

1226
01:25:32,330 --> 01:25:34,690
We'll get started as soon as
everyone's up on the platform.

1227
01:25:35,510 --> 01:25:37,620
[The biggest water bomb that they ever faced
is hanging right above their heads.]

1228
01:25:37,620 --> 01:25:39,780
How about we stand facing each other?

1229
01:25:40,310 --> 01:25:43,200
[Wanting to look at each other's face as
one team is soaked by the water bomb.]

1230
01:25:45,260 --> 01:25:47,930
- Staring at each other's a good idea.
- It's nice, isn't it?

1231

[Linking arms with one another to endure
the force of the water bomb.]

[Wishing everyone a Happy New Year
before the bomb is dropped on their heads.]

1234
01:26:01,180 --> 01:26:04,190
Thank you for all the love you've shown
us this past year.

1235
01:26:04,190 --> 01:26:07,060
- Thank you!
- We'll work even harder next year!

Thank you!

1237
01:26:08,660 --> 01:26:11,050

awaits them right in front of their eyes!]

1240

We will now start the final verdict for
Running Man Year End Competition.

1241
01:26:21,160 --> 01:26:24,660
I will start by putting all these balls
into the drawing machine.

1242
01:26:28,730 --> 01:26:32,090
If we lose right now, everything
we've done today was for nothing.

1243
01:26:35,170 --> 01:26:38,400
But we do have the advantage since
our team has more balls.

1244
01:26:38,400 --> 01:26:41,460
We do have the advantage,
but you know that it's still all about luck.

1245
01:26:43,700 --> 01:26:47,160
- Can't you put them in there faster?
- All the balls are now in.

1246
01:26:47,160 --> 01:26:53,720
[All 87 of the running balls are in.]

1247
01:26:54,030 --> 01:26:57,740
We will now start the running ball draw.

1248
01:26:57,750 --> 01:26:59,700
[Time to start the draw!]

1249
01:27:00,500 --> 01:27:02,440
So the ball that comes out
indicates who won, right?

1250
01:27:02,440 --> 01:27:05,140
- Ball that comes out is the winner?
- You win if it's your ball that comes out.

1251
01:27:05,140 --> 01:27:09,670
The team whose ball is not drawn will get
the water bomb dumped on them right away.

I have the ball in my hand.

[The winning team's ball is in
Announcer Kim Hwan's hand.]

[The Writers?]

1265
01:28:10,540 --> 01:28:12,330
It's Team Writers!

1266

the ones to get wet!]

01:28:48,790 --> 01:28:53,120
[We won, so why are we...]

[In complete celebration mode!]

ever looked in the past year.]

[Still clueless as to what happened.]

1276
01:29:21,900 --> 01:29:24,740
The ball says the 'writers'.
Team Writers won the draw.

1277
01:29:24,740 --> 01:29:28,500
[How did Team Writers get soaked
when they clearly won the draw?]

1278

Thank you!

1279
01:29:44,030 --> 01:29:46,110
What kind of luck is this?

1280
01:29:46,110 --> 01:29:49,750
You know what PD Myuk would say to this?
'Nothing we can do about it'.

1281
01:29:49,750 --> 01:29:51,190
[PD Myuk's usual response-
'Nothing we can do about it'.]

1282
01:29:52,220 --> 01:29:54,620
We're the ones who should've gotten wet.

1283
01:29:54,620 --> 01:29:57,420
But they made the mistake,
and got themselves soaked instead.

1284
01:29:57,420 --> 01:29:59,830
There's nothing that can be done.
It was their own mistake.

1285
01:29:59,830 --> 01:30:03,820
There must have been
some slight misunderstanding.

1286
01:30:04,980 --> 01:30:08,610
