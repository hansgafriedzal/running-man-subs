Anyways, it's good to see you, Gary.

83

Kwang Soo, stop
with your attempt at a love life.

89
00:06:20,136 --> 00:06:22,094

of your muscle.

[Bright and lovely.]

91
00:06:36,122 --> 00:06:39,338
I feel like I'm joining
a neighborhood convention.

92
00:06:40,046 --> 00:06:42,814
You look so beautiful
even this early in the morning.

93
00:06:42,815 --> 00:06:46,850

- Why are you here?

94

that happened last year...]

<i>Hurry up and get out here.</i>

97
00:07:01,665 --> 00:07:04,310
Just know that none of you are getting
anything from me in the new year.

98
00:07:05,534 --> 00:07:07,040
It's not like you've ever done anything
for us in the past.

99

- Hi.

102

- Good morning.
- Everything's such a drama.

103
00:07:20,334 --> 00:07:25,275
The expression on Ji Woo's face right now...
it's as if she's on a country getaway.

104
00:07:25,276 --> 00:07:26,870
She looks like someone who's here
on vacation from Seoul.

105
00:07:26,871 --> 00:07:29,202
Lady from Seoul whose heading off
to the market in the morning.

106
00:07:29,203 --> 00:07:31,320
[Heading off to buy cereal in the morning?]

107
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,280
And this one looks like a country bumpkin.

108
00:07:35,018 --> 00:07:38,330
<i>And now, you are all
divided into two teams.</i>

109
00:07:38,331 --> 00:07:41,007
But since there are so many on our team,
would some of us have to go to the other team?

110
00:07:41,008 --> 00:07:43,295
<i>That's why we have prepared additional
team members to join the other team.</i>

111
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:46,211
[Additional team members have
been prepared?]

112
00:07:46,989 --> 00:07:49,699
[And they're in this grand lucky pouch.]

113
00:07:50,855 --> 00:07:52,931
[Could they be inside?]

114
00:07:57,573 --> 00:07:59,399
<i>Why are they talking so
much out there?</i>

115
00:08:00,427 --> 00:08:02,932
[Who could be waiting in there?]

116
00:08:04,365 --> 00:08:05,762
Look at how happy she is.

117
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:15,028
- Why are you being like that?
- You're being too much!

118
00:08:15,029 --> 00:08:16,655
You're being really mean
right now... mean.

119
00:08:17,413 --> 00:08:20,247
- Are you trying to betray us now?
- You... out.

120
00:08:20,248 --> 00:08:22,913
[Trying to rid of her members at the news
of there being other additional members.]

121
00:08:22,914 --> 00:08:25,424
<i>If you shout out,
'I hope your 2013 is awesome'...</i>

122
00:08:25,425 --> 00:08:27,875
<i>your awesome gifts will come
out to greet you.</i>

123
00:08:27,876 --> 00:08:30,113
- I hope they're not very awesome.
- I bet they're inside that thing.

124
00:08:31,211 --> 00:08:32,513
- Let's shout it out together, Gary.
- Okay.

125
00:08:32,513 --> 00:08:35,111
- One, two, three... I hope...
- 2013...

126
00:08:35,844 --> 00:08:39,369
[Tsk tsk... you barely logged in as a
couple for 2013, and already?]

127
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:42,657
- We wish you an awesome 2013!
- We wish you an awesome 2013!

128

<i>[We wish you an awesome 2013!]</i>

129

[Just who's waiting as their awesome gifts?]

130
00:08:53,942 --> 00:08:56,804
- We wish you an awesome 2013!
- We wish you an awesome 2013!

are currently hiding in the giant pouch.]

[Beautiful F4 members, all in one place!]

139
00:09:35,944 --> 00:09:38,693
[No... way!]

140
00:09:38,763 --> 00:09:40,940
<i>Yong Hwa... Ki Kwang!</i>

141
00:09:43,033 --> 00:09:45,400
Hello! Hello!

142
00:09:46,709 --> 00:09:51,127
- Ji Woo... you have us though.
- Why did you guys have to come?

143
00:09:51,638 --> 00:09:54,255
[Hot temper flare up.]

144
00:09:54,817 --> 00:09:56,391
[I'm so happy!]

145
00:09:56,901 --> 00:09:59,282
[The truth leaving her mouth
gaped open.]

146
00:09:59,283 --> 00:10:01,247
<i>What's wrong with us?</i>

147
00:10:03,268 --> 00:10:06,031
<i>- Why? What's wrong with us?
- What do they have that we don't have?</i>

148
00:10:06,765 --> 00:10:09,062
All you guys are so scrubby!

149
00:10:09,063 --> 00:10:12,260
[Extreme aggravation]

150
00:10:14,651 --> 00:10:19,019
[Not being able to hang out with those
beautiful boys to start the new year...]

151
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:24,765
- You're being really harsh with your words.
- We don't lack anything compared to them.

152
00:10:24,766 --> 00:10:27,195
You're not being reasonable. When
we get cleaned up, we look like that too.

153
00:10:27,196 --> 00:10:30,170
It's only because we haven't done anything.
Let us get made up too then.

154
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:32,973
[They want to be made up?]

155
00:10:35,036 --> 00:10:37,184
Let us do the hair too! The hair!

156
00:10:38,328 --> 00:10:42,456
[Requesting for a hair and
makeup change!]

157
00:10:45,442 --> 00:10:49,198
[Just your average street guys without
the hair and the makeup.]

158
00:10:49,801 --> 00:10:52,280
[Ji Woo joining on in their demands.]

159
00:10:52,281 --> 00:10:54,843
- We can be as good as them.
- Give us a chance too!

160
00:10:54,844 --> 00:10:56,994
What am I supposed to do with them?

161
00:10:58,175 --> 00:11:01,359
You can just act as those guys' manager.

162
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,102
What's next on their schedule?

163
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:06,862
<i>In commemoration of our first broadcast
of the new year 2013 in Busan...</i>

164
00:11:06,863 --> 00:11:09,652
<i>We have asked Busan's F4
to join us today.</i>

165
00:11:09,653 --> 00:11:13,513
I will admit that they're all flower boys,
but not Ssam-Di!

166
00:11:15,819 --> 00:11:19,563
I will admit that those three are it,
but why is Ssam-Di included in there?

167
00:11:19,564 --> 00:11:22,245
Jae Suk, if Gary wasn't standing there,
Ssam-Di would be the manager!

168
00:11:24,535 --> 00:11:29,522
Why would he be included in there?
You should just be a part of our team instead.

169
00:11:29,523 --> 00:11:31,482
I'm still in my twenties.

170
00:11:31,483 --> 00:11:33,641
We have someone in his
twenties here too.

171
00:11:33,642 --> 00:11:36,939
- That's right! I'm in my twenties!
- You're still in your twenties?

172
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:38,637
I'm a lot younger than I look!

173
00:11:39,065 --> 00:11:41,092
[Utter shock?]

174
00:11:42,164 --> 00:11:45,808
[1985 born Giraffe shocking
Ji Woo into silence.]

175
00:11:45,809 --> 00:11:48,389
- I'm the youngest one on the show!
- Come on...

176
00:11:49,037 --> 00:11:52,084
He's Song Joong Ki's friend.
He's Song Joong Ki's best friend.

177
00:11:52,084 --> 00:11:54,113
You're putting me on!

178
00:11:54,945 --> 00:11:57,107
- He really is 27 years old.
- Really?

179
00:11:57,108 --> 00:12:00,643
Yong Hwa's like a part of our
Running Man family already.

180
00:12:00,644 --> 00:12:02,041
I've been on the show
seven times now.

181
00:12:02,042 --> 00:12:05,498
Yong Hwa really does honor us
by coming on our show frequently.

182
00:12:05,499 --> 00:12:07,371
- Jong Hyun, this is your first time, right?
- Yes, this is my first time.

183
00:12:07,372 --> 00:12:09,830
Jong Hyun recently wrapped up
filming a drama.

184
00:12:10,164 --> 00:12:14,529
[Acted the role of Jang Dong Geun's son
in the drama, 'A Gentleman's dignity'.]

185
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:16,775
Ah, that's the guy?

186
00:12:17,806 --> 00:12:20,396
[Big-nosed Brother
finally recognizing who he is.]

187
00:12:20,397 --> 00:12:22,433
- I really loved you in that drama!
- Thank you.

188
00:12:23,416 --> 00:12:25,199
- He's part of CN Blue.
- He's from CN Blue?

189
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,987
Why didn't you bring on any female guests
when those guys are here?

190
00:12:28,894 --> 00:12:30,690
We do have a female guest.
Ji Woo's standing right here.

191
00:12:30,691 --> 00:12:32,653
[What did you say?]

192
00:12:32,654 --> 00:12:34,157
I'm standing right here.

193
00:12:34,158 --> 00:12:35,544
Am I not enough?

194
00:12:36,119 --> 00:12:38,094
[Am I not enough here?]

195
00:12:39,363 --> 00:12:42,256
- Am I not enough for you guys?
- Ji Woo, you're more than enough!

196
00:12:43,034 --> 00:12:44,148
Right?

197
00:12:44,149 --> 00:12:47,521
Ji Woo doesn't get just a little annoyed,
but she gets really annoyed.

198
00:12:47,522 --> 00:12:49,570
She has some anger issues.

199
00:12:49,571 --> 00:12:53,343
After getting to know Ji Woo for a day,
I noticed she tends to get in your face.

200
00:12:53,344 --> 00:12:54,967
She totally does.

201
00:12:56,352 --> 00:12:58,748
- Are these the two teams then?
- The two teams have now been decided.

202
00:12:58,749 --> 00:12:59,872
[Team Ji Hyo vs. Team Ji Woo.]

203
00:12:59,907 --> 00:13:02,454
<i>2013 is the year of the snake.</i>

204
00:13:02,455 --> 00:13:03,908
It's the year of the snake?

205
00:13:03,909 --> 00:13:09,047
<i>To start off the new year of the snake,
this is the 12 signs of the zodiac race.</i>

206
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:16,263
- Dragon, snake, horse, sheep...
- rat, cow, tiger, rabbit...

207
00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:21,370
<i>You will come out one by one and pick a card
which has a picture of a zodiac sign on it.</i>

208
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:24,690
<i>Please come up front to
choose your card.</i>

209
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:28,575
<i>You will each choose a card which will
determine which animal you'll be representing.</i>

210
00:13:28,576 --> 00:13:30,446
<i>What's important about this portion
of the selection...</i>

211
00:13:30,447 --> 00:13:33,375
<i>is to see which one of you will
select the card with the snake drawing.</i>

212
00:13:33,376 --> 00:13:36,494
[Year of the snake!
Snake card is what's most important.]

213
00:13:39,825 --> 00:13:44,561
<i>The person to oust the person with the
snake card will become the ultimate winner.</i>

214
00:13:44,562 --> 00:13:46,563
So this is the point of this race?

215
00:13:46,564 --> 00:13:48,708
So the snake is King in this race?

216
00:13:48,709 --> 00:13:51,990
<i>Every time you pass a mission on
your way to the final destination...</i>

217
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:55,824
<i>you'll be able to gain a hint about
the person who has the snake card.</i>

218
00:13:55,825 --> 00:13:59,034
<i>- I hope all of you give your best efforts.
- This sounds like fun.</i>

219
00:14:00,144 --> 00:14:01,974
- This sounds like fun.
- Doesn't it sound fun?

220
00:14:01,975 --> 00:14:03,586
<i>- It sounds fun.
- Really fun.</i>

221
00:14:04,255 --> 00:14:06,946
- Listen to you guys.
- You guys all sound lively.

222
00:14:06,947 --> 00:14:08,399
Why are you following our speech?

223
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:12,124
<i>An amazing prize awaits you
at the end of this race.</i>

224
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:16,539
<i>And in the name of the winning team,
it will be donated to those less fortunate.</i>

225
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:18,176
- That sounds great.
- That's great.

226
00:14:21,586 --> 00:14:25,506
[Card selection.]

227
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:27,410
Do I just pick whichever one?

228
00:14:27,411 --> 00:14:32,535
[Each of their animal sign
is being determined.]

229
00:14:34,748 --> 00:14:38,455
[Just which one of them is the snake?]

230
00:14:41,617 --> 00:14:45,379
<i>[Go to Wa-heon Beach and
find the Running Man landmark.]</i>

231
00:14:45,379 --> 00:14:46,840
We have to go to the beach again?

232
00:14:47,493 --> 00:14:51,813
[Just which one of them has
the snake card?]

233
00:14:51,814 --> 00:14:57,148
[They must win the game in order to gain the
hint about the person with the snake card!]

234
00:14:57,148 --> 00:15:01,270
[But what could be the hint pertaining to
the person who was chosen by random?]

235
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:04,404
Snake or not,
we have Kim Jong Kook on our team!

236
00:15:04,792 --> 00:15:06,743
Yeah, that's what matters.

237
00:15:06,744 --> 00:15:09,577
What's there to worry about when
we have Kim Jong Kook on our team?

238
00:15:10,398 --> 00:15:14,014
Hey, I heard earlier...

239
00:15:14,015 --> 00:15:16,986
that Jong Hyun won the gold medal
in Busan for Judo?

240
00:15:17,545 --> 00:15:20,507
- How old were you when you won the medal?
- Third grade in middle school.

241
00:15:20,508 --> 00:15:22,256
- Third grade in middle school?
- Yes.

242
00:15:22,591 --> 00:15:24,692
Then I bet you'll be able to
go up against Jong Kook.

243
00:15:24,693 --> 00:15:27,644
In that case,
you can take charge of Jong Kook.

244
00:15:27,645 --> 00:15:29,188
You have to take care of him
no matter what.

245
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:38,230
[Guh-ga Bridge. Spanning 8.2 km
between Busan and Guhjae-Do.]

246
00:15:38,231 --> 00:15:43,427
[The beauty of the south seas
bringing out their delight.]

247
00:15:47,559 --> 00:15:50,787
- It's so beautiful.
- It looks like something out of a picture.

248
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:54,219
[Heading towards Guh-jaedo
through a scenic drive.]

249
00:15:55,035 --> 00:15:56,182
There it is.

250
00:15:57,467 --> 00:16:00,607
[Beautiful scenery everywhere they go.]

251
00:16:00,607 --> 00:16:03,379
[Team Ji Woo arrives on scene.]

252
00:16:05,137 --> 00:16:07,992
[Fascinated by the Running Man's landmark.]

253
00:16:09,235 --> 00:16:14,240
[Beautiful shore of Wa-hyun Beach.]

254

[The blinding beauty of the southern sea.]

255

<i>Run with the opponent's queen
on your back.</i>

256
00:16:26,551 --> 00:16:27,798
The opposing team?

257
00:16:27,799 --> 00:16:30,852
<i>[Run with the opponent team's queen
on your back.]</i>

258
00:16:30,852 --> 00:16:33,595
How are they going to carry me
on their back?

259
00:16:33,595 --> 00:16:36,680
- Wouldn't you like that?
- But I'm too tall.

260
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:40,012
It's a good thing though.
That's better for our team.

261
00:16:40,013 --> 00:16:43,565
- Don't make it easy on them.
- But I feel so bad!

262
00:16:43,566 --> 00:16:45,587
You have to just hang on their backs
and make it hard for them to carry you.

263
00:16:46,144 --> 00:16:47,489
Hello.

264
00:16:48,566 --> 00:16:52,710
This is really... now that we're back home,
our popularity here is no joke!

265
00:16:52,711 --> 00:16:55,725
- No, it's no joke.
- It's no joke here in Gyung-nam.

266
00:17:00,056 --> 00:17:02,642
You can't take any pictures.
I'm sorry, I apologize.

267
00:17:02,643 --> 00:17:04,155
[Manager Gary refusing
their pictures to be taken?]

268
00:17:05,102 --> 00:17:06,954
Look at Gary.
He's being their manager.

269
00:17:08,255 --> 00:17:11,851
[Manager Gary protecting his
Flower Boy Idols.]

270
00:17:12,948 --> 00:17:16,954
- Gary, you've finally found your profession?
- Yes, I took care of it all.

271
00:17:17,635 --> 00:17:20,897
- How do you say 'So cool' in Busan dialect?
- It's a killer.

272
00:17:20,897 --> 00:17:22,812
It's a killer. It's tally killing.

273
00:17:22,813 --> 00:17:24,488
- Killer...
- It's a killer.

274
00:17:24,782 --> 00:17:26,687
Lookin' good.

275

Lookin' good?
You guys aren't lookin' so good!

276
00:17:29,376 --> 00:17:31,244
Jae Suk, you ain't lookin' so good!

277
00:17:32,164 --> 00:17:34,959
Jae Suk? Ssam-Di!

278
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:38,364
[This is my home ground...]

279
00:17:38,365 --> 00:17:39,972
Ain't lookin' good... totally ain't!

280
00:17:41,088 --> 00:17:45,654
<i>The mission in this game is to run with the
opponent team's queen on your back.</i>

281
00:17:45,655 --> 00:17:47,696
- While carrying them on our backs?
- As in a piggy back ride?

282
00:17:49,058 --> 00:17:51,455
- Really?
- It's not good.

283
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:58,962
[Happier about carrying Ji Woo around
than at wanting to win the game?]

284
00:17:58,962 --> 00:18:01,426
- This is so fascinating.
- What's so fascinating about that?

285
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:08,632
[A Hallyu Goddess that even the
idols find to be fascinating.]

286
00:18:11,141 --> 00:18:12,734
- You want me to get you her autograph?
- What's wrong with you guys?

287
00:18:13,477 --> 00:18:17,781
[A relay race around the 'R' marker.]

288
00:18:17,782 --> 00:18:23,284
If you were to carry Ji Woo on your back
and pass her off to Ki Kwang...

289
00:18:23,285 --> 00:18:25,827
all of you will have to help her
move onto his back to make it go faster.

290
00:18:25,828 --> 00:18:27,385
- Do you understand what I'm saying?
- Yes, we understand.

291
00:18:27,386 --> 00:18:30,530
Look at Ji Hyo over there.
She's the captain of that team.

292
00:18:30,531 --> 00:18:32,579
We have to win this, got it?

293
00:18:33,271 --> 00:18:36,993
[Humbly listening to her commands.]

294
00:18:37,377 --> 00:18:38,665
We have to win this, got it?

295
00:18:39,239 --> 00:18:40,905
Look at the glint in her eyes.

296
00:18:41,319 --> 00:18:42,647
You can do this, right?

297
00:18:42,648 --> 00:18:45,541
What is this?
A female General training her people?

298
00:18:46,085 --> 00:18:48,643
One, two, three... fighting!

299
00:18:48,644 --> 00:18:50,129
[Sir Ace... fighting!]

300
00:18:51,275 --> 00:18:53,909
[First round - Yong Hwa vs. Suk Jin.]

301
00:18:55,802 --> 00:18:58,149
- I'm heavy. I'm heavy.
- It's okay.

302
00:18:58,150 --> 00:19:01,448
That's good, Ji Woo! That's great!

303
00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:05,659
- You have to be heavy!
- It's because I feel bad for him!

304
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:08,206
You have to go limp on his back and be heavy.
[Surprised at her touching him?]

305
00:19:09,244 --> 00:19:11,528
- Sit down.
- Okay!

306
00:19:11,529 --> 00:19:13,020
- Sit down.
- I said, okay!

307

is right here.]

[Great job, Ace.]

323
00:20:22,584 --> 00:20:25,845
I can't do that... I can't do that.

324
00:20:27,024 --> 00:20:28,699
- You can't do that!
- Ji Woo, lean back!

325

You're not supposed to lie so
calmly against his back!

326

would make it that easy.]

Ji Hyo! Come up here and
sing the yogurt song with us!

496
00:31:39,373 --> 00:31:41,464
- Come on!
- You have to be our center.

497
00:31:41,465 --> 00:31:43,447
<i>One, two, three, four!</i>

498
00:31:43,826 --> 00:31:47,294
[Leader Song, Blank Ji joins in
on the yogurt song singing.]

499
00:31:47,295 --> 00:31:51,129
<i>If you don't have a yogurt,
give us the yogurt juice instead.</i>

500
00:31:54,863 --> 00:31:55,992
This is fun.

501
00:31:55,993 --> 00:31:57,636
<i>Who's Gary?</i>

502
00:31:59,954 --> 00:32:02,823
- She just asked who Gary is.
- Lady! Gary is right here!

503
00:32:03,894 --> 00:32:05,578
<i>She just asked who Gary is.</i>

504
00:32:06,502 --> 00:32:09,687
[The name Gary drawing curiosity
no matter where he goes.]

505
00:32:09,688 --> 00:32:11,318
<i>I'm sorry for not being
recognizable enough.</i>

506
00:32:11,765 --> 00:32:13,736
[Passing over the mission envelope.]
What is it?

507
00:32:13,736 --> 00:32:17,582
<i>[First team to find the opposing team's
yogurt queen and take their hat off wins.]</i>

508
00:32:17,582 --> 00:32:19,353
<i>This is the yogurt village.</i>

509
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:24,687
<i>One of you has to become the yogurt queen
and avoid getting caught by the other team</i>

510
00:32:24,687 --> 00:32:28,128
<i>and if you find your opponent's
yogurt queen, then you win the game.</i>

511
00:32:28,129 --> 00:32:30,780
<i>The queen doesn't have to
be a woman.</i>

512
00:32:31,249 --> 00:32:34,463
<i>For this mission, you have to find the queen
on the opposing team and get their hat off.</i>

513
00:32:35,530 --> 00:32:37,650
[Just who will be chosen as
the queen in Ji Woo's team?]

514
00:32:38,116 --> 00:32:40,302
It can't be Kwang Soo.
He would be too noticeable.

515
00:32:40,302 --> 00:32:41,528
I can't even hide because I'd stick out.

516
00:32:41,529 --> 00:32:44,435
I think Kwang Soo and I both
would stick out too much.

517
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:47,816
I wonder if it should be someone
who's a fast runner.

518
00:32:47,817 --> 00:32:50,684
Since the other team is so
knowledgeable in things like this...

519
00:32:50,685 --> 00:32:53,107
I don't think being a fast runner
is what's important here.

520
00:32:53,108 --> 00:32:54,609
Yes, I understand.

521
00:32:56,370 --> 00:32:59,442
[Everyone listening to
the command of Leader Song.]

522
00:32:59,442 --> 00:33:02,593
No matter how fast you can run,
Jong Kook will still be able to catch you.

523
00:33:02,825 --> 00:33:06,504
Our opponents could think that
we'd choose Yong Hwa as our queen.

524
00:33:06,505 --> 00:33:07,563
- Don't you think?
- You're right.

525
00:33:07,563 --> 00:33:10,987
If anything, we should trick them
and have Ki Kwang be our queen.

526
00:33:13,146 --> 00:33:15,719
Let's start by disguising him first.
Here, put your clothes on.

527
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,023
[Disguising their queen.]

528
00:33:20,715 --> 00:33:23,736
<i>Wow... he's starting to look
really pretty.</i>

529
00:33:25,786 --> 00:33:30,354
[Yogurt Queen Ki Kwang, who seems
to be so well suited for his makeup.]

530
00:33:33,092 --> 00:33:35,288
[Flower boy]

531
00:33:36,904 --> 00:33:39,143
[Yong Hwa and Ssam-Di
getting bored on the sideline?]

532
00:33:39,916 --> 00:33:44,368
[Playing around and taking pictures
with the wig on their heads.]

533
00:33:46,721 --> 00:33:48,974
[Having too much fun.]

534
00:33:48,975 --> 00:33:51,976
- What are you guys doing?
- Are you guys here to play?

535
00:33:51,977 --> 00:33:53,674
<i>Ssam-Di, you look hilarious!</i>

536
00:33:55,338 --> 00:33:57,926
- We're trying to disguise him here!
- That looks like fun.

537
00:33:57,927 --> 00:33:59,899
We have to disguise our queen!

538
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:01,560
Kang Gary!

539
00:34:06,718 --> 00:34:08,702
[What?]

540
00:34:13,770 --> 00:34:15,488
[My face is true hip hop.]

541
00:34:15,489 --> 00:34:18,019
- He looks like the definition of hip hop.
- How does he make that kind of an impression?

542
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:20,880
[Definition of hip hop.]

543
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:23,216
There seriously can't be
anyone else like that.

544
00:34:23,665 --> 00:34:25,488
<i>His face is so totally hip hop.</i>

545
00:34:26,413 --> 00:34:28,121
[Even Leader Song take a moment from
her nagging to take a picture.]

546
00:34:31,517 --> 00:34:34,665
<i>I'm an eight ton truck with
a broken handle!</i>

547
00:34:34,666 --> 00:34:37,293
<i>My life is always so crooked...</i>

548
00:34:37,294 --> 00:34:39,830
<i>About to enroll in this
school of life!</i>

549
00:34:39,831 --> 00:34:42,163
<i>About to enroll in this
school of life!</i>

550
00:34:46,161 --> 00:34:48,041
Want to meet up once a month?

551
00:34:48,042 --> 00:34:50,554
I'm so happy being around you guys!

552
00:34:51,516 --> 00:34:54,090
[F4 and Gary brimming over with
enthusiasm.]

553
00:35:03,487 --> 00:35:04,953
- Are you finished with the disguise?
- Yes, we're finished.

554
00:35:04,953 --> 00:35:08,930
[The yogurt queens to enter
the village first.]

555
00:35:08,930 --> 00:35:11,872
[Will be entering the village at the same
time as the opposing team's queen.]

556
00:35:11,872 --> 00:35:13,440
You have to stay well hidden, okay?

557
00:35:13,441 --> 00:35:16,757
- Stay well hidden.
- One, two, three... fighting!

558
00:35:18,392 --> 00:35:20,803
[The queens gets on their way!]

559
00:35:22,399 --> 00:35:25,565
I think I need to research the village
in the map a bit first.

560
00:35:27,808 --> 00:35:31,919
[A map on the wall...]

561
00:35:31,919 --> 00:35:34,212
[Huh?]

562
00:35:34,684 --> 00:35:37,899
[It's a map of all of Geojae-Do!]

563
00:35:40,728 --> 00:35:43,131
The team from the other team is
on the move too, right?

564
00:35:47,123 --> 00:35:48,632
You really can't tell me apart, right?

565
00:35:50,338 --> 00:35:52,758
- You didn't recognize me?
- No, I didn't recognize you.

566
00:35:53,592 --> 00:35:55,499
Then we're halfway towards winning.

567
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:59,735
[Then the Yogurt Queen for
Team Ji Woo is none other than...]

568
00:35:59,736 --> 00:36:01,683
[Big-nosed Brother.]

569
00:36:03,528 --> 00:36:05,665
Since I have a sense of feminine aura
that flows from me unconsciously...

570
00:36:06,082 --> 00:36:07,647
I was chosen to play the role.

571
00:36:07,648 --> 00:36:09,012
[We've never seen anything like that
in the past two and a half years...]

572
00:36:10,143 --> 00:36:13,251
[Yogurt Queen mission - Start!]

573
00:36:14,272 --> 00:36:16,872
[The search starts now?]

574
00:36:16,873 --> 00:36:18,212
<i>You will be playing the toss game.</i>

575
00:36:18,212 --> 00:36:22,376
<i>Play the yogurt container toss game and
the person that makes it in first</i>

576
00:36:22,376 --> 00:36:23,915
<i>will join in on the mission.</i>

577
00:36:23,950 --> 00:36:25,742
- Yes, we understand.
- We drink before we get to play?

578
00:36:26,970 --> 00:36:28,917
The yogurt tastes better when you
drink them upside down.

579
00:36:28,918 --> 00:36:31,253
- You have to bite off a little hole.
- Yeah, and you need to freeze it too.

580
00:36:31,254 --> 00:36:34,088
- Yeah, and freeze them.
- Is that how kids these days drinks these?

581
00:36:35,118 --> 00:36:38,030
[Afro Gary envious of their
Busan speech?]

582
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:42,696
[The more they look at him,
the more he reminds them of Ki Young.]

583
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,922
[Checking the wind.]

584
00:36:46,612 --> 00:36:49,628
- So we have to keep drinking the yogurt?
- That would be trouble.

585
00:36:52,152 --> 00:36:53,326
Yes!

586
00:36:53,327 --> 00:36:54,832
[Fail]

587
00:36:54,833 --> 00:36:56,553
[Even though it was a good throw,
he still fails to make the goal.]

588
00:36:58,054 --> 00:37:00,003
[Jong Hyun is up next to pitch.]

589
00:37:02,317 --> 00:37:03,887
I think you're going to make it in.

590
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:06,019
Ssam-Di... Ssam-Di!

591
00:37:06,411 --> 00:37:08,515
[Oh!]

592
00:37:12,517 --> 00:37:14,919
[Seems overly excited.]

593
00:37:16,167 --> 00:37:19,343
Get your head on straight. You're
the oldest. Show them how to succeed.

594
00:37:19,343 --> 00:37:20,846
[Will he be the first to succeed
being the oldest brother on the team?]

595
00:37:20,847 --> 00:37:23,366
[Not a chance...]

596
00:37:25,719 --> 00:37:27,208
A little more to the right, Ji Hyo.

597
00:37:31,579 --> 00:37:33,530
This needs to be a little...

598
00:37:33,531 --> 00:37:35,040
Don't speak in fancy Seoul city talk.

599
00:37:35,433 --> 00:37:37,687
Don't say things like 'This needs to be'
but say 'This gotta be'...

600
00:37:38,059 --> 00:37:40,783
I think it would be better to crush it
a bit before throwing it.

601
00:37:40,784 --> 00:37:43,322
[Idol Ace Yong Hwa,
throwing the pitch after crushing it.]

602
00:37:43,323 --> 00:37:45,099
I'm smart too.

603
00:37:48,125 --> 00:37:49,372
It's not going in!

604
00:37:52,885 --> 00:37:55,617
[So close, but hits the rim and misses!]

605
00:37:58,595 --> 00:38:00,246
Can't you just count that as a goal?

606
00:38:00,997 --> 00:38:01,960
Count it as a goal!

607
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:04,500
[Ah... you want us to count it as a goal?
Is that what you said?]

608
00:38:05,730 --> 00:38:07,559
[Team Ji Woo also in the midst of
doing the challenge.]

609
00:38:08,251 --> 00:38:09,509
<i>We have to throw it
when the wind isn't blowing.</i>

610
00:38:12,087 --> 00:38:13,873
Ugh... that's too bad.

611
00:38:15,055 --> 00:38:16,611
You have to make it in this time.

612
00:38:17,831 --> 00:38:20,105
[Giraffe drinking the yogurt juice
for Jong Kook instead.]

613
00:38:21,085 --> 00:38:23,639
I've already had six because I had to
drink Jong Kook's on top of my own.

614
00:38:25,589 --> 00:38:27,657
- I already had five myself.
- I'm going to make it in this time.

615
00:38:27,658 --> 00:38:30,825
I'm going to make sure to succeed
so Kwang Soo's efforts weren't wasted.

616
00:38:34,344 --> 00:38:36,176
[Ro-Ro succeeds!]

617
00:38:36,177 --> 00:38:38,093
- I'm going. I'm going to go.
- You made it in? Go.

618
00:38:38,094 --> 00:38:39,655
- Hurry up and go.
- Go and find the queen, okay?

619
00:38:39,656 --> 00:38:41,942
- Hurry up and find the queen.
- I can just go, right?

620
00:38:43,003 --> 00:38:46,534
[Haroro goes to search after succeeding
in making the yogurt container toss.]

621
00:38:46,534 --> 00:38:48,190
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

622
00:38:49,018 --> 00:38:50,224
You're not it.

623
00:38:52,424 --> 00:38:54,890
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

624
00:38:55,692 --> 00:38:58,728
I don't think their queen would be walking
around on a major street like this, right?

625
00:38:59,349 --> 00:39:00,932
Let's go over that way.

626
00:39:11,288 --> 00:39:13,299
[Idol Ace Yong Hwa succeeds!]

627
00:39:16,652 --> 00:39:18,270
<i>Jung Yong Hwa, you're the best!</i>

628
00:39:21,273 --> 00:39:25,014
[Big brother Gary wanting to do everything
that the little brothers are doing.]

629
00:39:27,021 --> 00:39:29,465
- I was born to be on Running Man.
- Jung Yong Hwa, fighting!

630
00:39:29,466 --> 00:39:32,278
Please put a subtitle on the screen here.
That I was born to be on Running Man.

631
00:39:32,998 --> 00:39:34,566
They're going to put
the subtitles in Busan dialect!

632
00:39:34,567 --> 00:39:37,042
A man born to be on Reun-ning Man.

633
00:39:38,591 --> 00:39:41,806
[A man born to be on Reun-ning Man?]

634
00:39:44,634 --> 00:39:46,410
Go! Hurry up and get out of here!

635
00:39:47,021 --> 00:39:48,794
<i>I'll see you all later!</i>

636
00:39:49,509 --> 00:39:51,248
[Team Ji Hyo's Yong Hwa makes
his entrance.]

637
00:39:52,451 --> 00:39:53,694
Yong Hwa cam.

638
00:39:58,823 --> 00:40:00,973
[Jong Hyun also succeeds!]

639
00:40:01,767 --> 00:40:04,862
- Throw towards the back... the back.
- That was awesome.

640
00:40:05,379 --> 00:40:06,915
- Back?
- That was awesome.

641
00:40:07,401 --> 00:40:09,510
I made it in.

642
00:40:12,954 --> 00:40:15,149
[Jae Suk also makes it in.]

643
00:40:15,150 --> 00:40:16,914
- Did it go in?
- It went in.

644
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:19,174
- Hurry up and catch the queen.
- Okay.

645
00:40:19,354 --> 00:40:20,876
I'll be back, okay?

646
00:40:22,405 --> 00:40:24,336
[Ji Woo's turn.]

647
00:40:25,224 --> 00:40:27,607
- Oh!
- What do you mean, 'Oh'?

648
00:40:28,894 --> 00:40:30,409
I totally missed it.

649
00:40:33,591 --> 00:40:37,105
[Ki Kwang doing a good job of
staying hidden and avoiding detection.]

650
00:40:37,105 --> 00:40:38,698
I bet others started
making their moves, right?

651
00:40:39,523 --> 00:40:41,360
[Where is their queen?]

652
00:40:43,231 --> 00:40:45,192
I don't think the queen will be
walking around on the main roads.

653
00:40:45,773 --> 00:40:47,563
I bet the queen is staying hidden
in one of the side streets.

654
00:41:05,293 --> 00:41:06,796
[Maybe not?]

655
00:41:11,114 --> 00:41:13,725
I feel like someone is going to
show up suddenly in front of me.

656
00:41:27,055 --> 00:41:30,164
[Did he see someone?]

657
00:41:33,764 --> 00:41:35,864
I just saw Jae Suk!
That totally startled me!

658
00:41:42,996 --> 00:41:45,598
[Did Jae Suk see Ki Kwang?]

659
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:49,319
[Please...]

660
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:56,444
[Oh... right there...]

661
00:41:56,445 --> 00:41:58,302
Oh... it's not Yong Hwa?

662
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:05,518
[It seems as though Team Ji Woo really
guessed Yong Hwa to be the Queen.]

663
00:42:05,519 --> 00:42:07,305
- I thought you were going to be the Queen.
- Hello there.

664
00:42:07,306 --> 00:42:09,624
- Hi, Yong Hwa.
- Who is it?

665
00:42:09,625 --> 00:42:11,066
- Huh?
- Who's your Queen?

666
00:42:11,067 --> 00:42:12,882
You know I can't tell you that!

667
00:42:15,446 --> 00:42:18,457
[Team Ji Woo's unknown Queen.]

668
00:42:21,166 --> 00:42:22,696
This is really hard.

669
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,143
I have to make sure that I'm
not noticeable.

670
00:42:28,176 --> 00:42:29,658
I'm scared.

671
00:42:37,110 --> 00:42:39,751
[Oh... my team member.]

672
00:42:42,001 --> 00:42:43,253
You scared me.

673
00:42:43,254 --> 00:42:46,009
- It's my team member.
- Go hide and stay hidden.

674
00:42:47,793 --> 00:42:49,776
Stay up there.
You have to stay hidden.

675
00:42:51,635 --> 00:42:53,145
Don't come out.

676
00:42:55,467 --> 00:42:58,725
[Just then!]

677
00:43:00,421 --> 00:43:02,359
[Did Ro-Ro witness this scene?]

678
00:43:06,827 --> 00:43:09,476
[So that's where you're hiding...]

679
00:43:10,847 --> 00:43:12,437
Are there a lot of people up there?

680
00:43:18,474 --> 00:43:21,554
[Jong Hyun coming face to face
with Ha Ha.]

681
00:43:22,341 --> 00:43:24,968
[Extreme nervousness]

682
00:43:26,391 --> 00:43:28,083
Jae Suk is...

683
00:43:34,877 --> 00:43:37,952
[Losing his ability to breathe.]

684
00:43:45,425 --> 00:43:47,806
[Jong Hyun making it way too obvious
that something is going on.]

685
00:43:48,456 --> 00:43:49,950
- You're acting suspicious.
- What?

686
00:43:49,951 --> 00:43:51,295
- You're acting suspicious.
- Why am I suspicious?

687
00:43:53,353 --> 00:43:55,741
- Okay... I'll see you later, okay?
- Yes.

688
00:43:57,583 --> 00:43:58,876
Jae Suk!

689
00:43:59,235 --> 00:44:00,889
[Ro-Ro requesting for a backup.]

690
00:44:01,539 --> 00:44:03,039
- Over here, Jae Suk.
- What is it?

691
00:44:07,255 --> 00:44:09,849
[Jong Hyun stuck in a difficult situation.
The Yogurt Queen, Ki Kwang.]

692
00:44:15,914 --> 00:44:17,642
[What do I do?]

693
00:44:19,662 --> 00:44:21,202
Jong Hyun, why are you blocking
this alley?

694
00:44:27,698 --> 00:44:31,904
[Definitely heading towards
that house...]

695
00:44:37,422 --> 00:44:39,528
- There he is!
- There he is!

696
00:44:41,363 --> 00:44:44,025
[Yogurt Queen Ki Kwang is found!]

697
00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:47,669
[Jong Hyun's lightening quick defense
to help Ki Kwang escape!]

698
00:44:48,192 --> 00:44:50,176
Run! Run!

699
00:44:52,996 --> 00:44:54,406
Make your escape!

700
00:44:54,407 --> 00:44:56,476
[Ro-Ro on the chase!]

701
00:44:58,946 --> 00:45:01,172
[Team Ji Hyo in extreme danger!]

702
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:15,072
[Jong Hyun bringing Ro-Ro
to a stop.]

703
00:45:17,393 --> 00:45:20,396
[Ki Kwang making his escape thanks to
Jong Hyun's quick defense moves.]

704
00:45:33,749 --> 00:45:36,861
[Of all places, he makes his escape
to a house with a guard dog...]

705
00:45:40,142 --> 00:45:44,368
[Please stop barking...]

706
00:45:45,870 --> 00:45:48,645
[These three still not able to
make it in the goal.]

707
00:45:52,593 --> 00:45:54,542
[Gary succeeds!]

708
00:45:58,607 --> 00:46:01,248
I'm going to go in there.
Good luck guys.

709
00:46:01,249 --> 00:46:04,189
- Good luck.
- Don't think about anything as you throw it.

710
00:46:05,451 --> 00:46:06,808
[You first, Leader Song.]

711
00:46:13,279 --> 00:46:15,081
Okay, go. Throw it now.

712
00:46:15,082 --> 00:46:18,362
[Ji Woo feeling more desperate
inches her way forward?]

713
00:46:18,362 --> 00:46:20,146
I can't really see very well.

714
00:46:25,372 --> 00:46:27,300
[Disappointingly fails.]

715
00:46:31,547 --> 00:46:33,426
[Kwang Soo succeeds.]

716
00:46:39,677 --> 00:46:41,353
[Jong Kook succeeds.]

717
00:46:41,354 --> 00:46:42,711
- I'll see you in there.
- We'll see you soon.

718
00:46:50,692 --> 00:46:52,160
Ugh... seriously!

719
00:46:53,196 --> 00:46:55,702
I'm seriously not good at
things like this.

720
00:46:59,359 --> 00:47:02,032
[Thanks to Jong Hyun's work,
Ki Kwang made his escape far away.]

721
00:47:04,444 --> 00:47:06,208
- Are you going to keep following me?
- What?

722
00:47:06,209 --> 00:47:08,097
Why do you just keep following me?

723
00:47:08,098 --> 00:47:09,489
- That's because you're...
- Come this way!

724
00:47:09,490 --> 00:47:11,610
He ran off this way.

725
00:47:12,134 --> 00:47:13,688
Dong Hoon!

726
00:47:13,689 --> 00:47:14,847
[Oh no... Mr. Capable now in the mix?]

727
00:47:14,882 --> 00:47:16,304
The feeling I get...

728
00:47:17,812 --> 00:47:19,776
I don't think he's walking around
on the streets.

729
00:47:21,267 --> 00:47:23,472
- Jong Kook...
- I think he's hiding somewhere.

730
00:47:23,473 --> 00:47:25,173
Why is that dog barking like that?

731
00:47:25,174 --> 00:47:27,821
[Ro-Ro... his senses are
sharp today!]

732
00:47:29,592 --> 00:47:31,443
[No kidding...]

733
00:47:32,805 --> 00:47:34,522
The barking means that
there's a stranger around.

734
00:47:34,522 --> 00:47:35,675
You're right.

735
00:47:36,470 --> 00:47:38,575
[I'm in big trouble.]

736
00:47:39,745 --> 00:47:42,134
[What do I do?]

737
00:47:43,092 --> 00:47:45,882
I keep hearing a dog barking around here.
Why would the dog be doing that?

738
00:47:46,834 --> 00:47:48,937
There must be a reason why
the dog would be barking like that.

739
00:47:52,797 --> 00:47:56,629
[One... two...]

740
00:47:57,374 --> 00:47:59,238
[Ki Kwang making yet another
escape!]

741
00:48:01,243 --> 00:48:03,274
[Jong Hyun uses his whole body
to aid his escape once again!]

742
00:48:05,736 --> 00:48:07,158
Catch Lee Ki Kwang!

743
00:48:16,618 --> 00:48:19,718
[Defender Jong Hyun - Using
his whole body to block the gate?]

744
00:48:19,718 --> 00:48:23,003
[If the others walk around
to the other end...]

745
00:48:24,969 --> 00:48:26,187
Watch out! Watch out!

746
00:48:26,188 --> 00:48:27,752
[Discovers Ki Kwang.]

747
00:48:31,819 --> 00:48:34,319
[Yogurt Ki Kwang completely trapped
without room to escape!]

748
00:48:44,455 --> 00:48:45,555
Catch him!

749
00:48:48,015 --> 00:48:50,542
[Team Ji Hyo's Yogurt Queen
captured in the end.]

750
00:48:51,871 --> 00:48:53,381
<i>Catch him.</i>

751
00:48:53,382 --> 00:48:55,924
<i>That's... </i>

752
00:48:55,925 --> 00:48:57,684
You really do look beautiful!

753
00:48:57,685 --> 00:49:00,126
- Ki Kwang... you look beautiful.
- He's beautiful.

754
00:49:01,938 --> 00:49:04,617
[The hat...]

755
00:49:04,617 --> 00:49:07,181
[Come off... and Team Ji Woo wins!]

756
00:49:07,182 --> 00:49:08,778
[Team Ji Woo wins the game!]

757
00:49:16,821 --> 00:49:18,947
<i>Mr. Ssam-Di!
You still haven't made the goal?</i>

758
00:49:22,399 --> 00:49:24,537
Ha Ha was really on the ball today.

759
00:49:26,037 --> 00:49:28,345
- I kept hearing the dog barking.
- Really?

760
00:49:28,346 --> 00:49:30,365
That was a sure sign to me
that he was there.

761
00:49:30,366 --> 00:49:32,990
Ssam-Di, Ssam Di...
you totally ain't lookin' good!

762
00:49:34,912 --> 00:49:36,880
Ssam-Di, you still haven't
made it in the basket?

763
00:49:37,845 --> 00:49:40,364
- We threw it like a hundred times.
- You drank this many?

764
00:49:40,365 --> 00:49:43,133
You need to crumble this up a little bit
before you throw it.

765
00:49:43,134 --> 00:49:47,671
- What were you guys doing?
- Ssam-Di, why couldn't you get it in?

766
00:49:47,672 --> 00:49:49,429
The wind is blowing really hard today.

767
00:49:50,686 --> 00:49:53,335
[Due to the strong winds blowing, the
game's over before he could even join?]

768
00:49:53,336 --> 00:49:56,645
- I wonder if Suk Jin is still hiding.
- Suk Jin...

769
00:49:56,646 --> 00:49:57,763
[Just where is Team Ji Woo's Queen?]

770
00:50:01,155 --> 00:50:02,686
I bet you it's Yong Hwa.

771
00:50:03,369 --> 00:50:04,773
I think it's Yong Hwa.

772
00:50:04,774 --> 00:50:06,617
[I need to let the others know.]

773
00:50:07,476 --> 00:50:12,235
[I have to quickly alert my team
that it's Yong Hwa...]

774
00:50:12,235 --> 00:50:16,019
[Why isn't anyone coming?]

775
00:50:16,607 --> 00:50:20,561
<i>We will deliver the hint to your car.
Please get started on your way.</i>

776
00:50:20,562 --> 00:50:23,638
We'll see you later,
Jong Hyun and Ki Kwang.

777
00:50:23,639 --> 00:50:26,376
It's okay. We're tied right now.
No need to worry.

778
00:50:28,944 --> 00:50:31,680
<i>Since your team won the game,
the hint will be given to you.</i>

779
00:50:34,448 --> 00:50:35,449
What is it?

780
00:50:35,450 --> 00:50:39,081
- Yoo Jin?
- That's our hint? Our hint is Yoo Jin?

781
00:50:40,325 --> 00:50:42,183
Winter Sonata's Yoo Jin?

782
00:50:42,566 --> 00:50:44,969
The main characters name is
'Winter Sonata' is Yoo Jin, right?

783
00:50:45,444 --> 00:50:46,575
Isn't that too obvious?

784
00:50:46,575 --> 00:50:50,685
[Then does it mean that Ji Woo
is the snake?]

785
00:50:50,686 --> 00:50:52,087
- It's Ji Woo?
- I think it's Ji Woo.

786
00:50:53,791 --> 00:50:58,965
[Is the card that Ji Woo picked this
morning the snake card?]

787
00:50:59,861 --> 00:51:02,462
They don't usually make it so
obvious though.

788
00:51:02,463 --> 00:51:04,971
Yoo Jae Suk, Ji Suk Jin?

789
00:51:04,972 --> 00:51:07,202
Ah... Yoo Jae Suk, Ji Suk Jin. Yoo Jin...

790
00:51:07,203 --> 00:51:09,754
Ah... Yoo Jae Suk, Ji Suk Jin?

791
00:51:09,755 --> 00:51:12,257
Or could it be Ssam-Di's given name?

792
00:51:12,425 --> 00:51:14,258
What is Ssam-Di's given name?

793
00:51:14,876 --> 00:51:16,721
Ssam-Di's given name is Jung Ki Suk.

794
00:51:16,722 --> 00:51:18,414
- Ki Suk?
- His given name is Ki Suk?

795
00:51:18,415 --> 00:51:20,300
[Not even close to Yoo Jin...]

796
00:51:20,301 --> 00:51:22,783
<i>It's such a relief that we didn't
lose this game too.</i>

797
00:51:24,703 --> 00:51:28,077
[The third mission location
Running Man teams have arrived at.]

798
00:51:28,077 --> 00:51:32,388
[A small branch of school in the village
with a total student body of 13 students.]

799
00:51:32,388 --> 00:51:33,820
Hi, kids.
Are all the students here?

800
00:51:34,295 --> 00:51:38,196
[Trees of hope who came out to
greet the Running Man members.]

801
00:51:39,261 --> 00:51:41,531
- I'm in sixth grade.
- Sixth grade? You must be the oldest.

802
00:51:41,532 --> 00:51:43,890
- Hi... hi.
- Hello!

803
00:51:43,890 --> 00:51:47,814
[Mr. Capable showing
his kinder side to the children.]

804
00:51:47,815 --> 00:51:49,955
I'm a huge fan of Running Man.

805
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:54,353
I know that we've mentioned this before,
but the scenery around here is amazing.

806
00:51:54,354 --> 00:51:55,782
- Yes, it's beautiful.
- The scenery is just stunning.

807
00:51:55,783 --> 00:51:58,289
The color of the ocean... what's it called?
The Jade ocean?

808
00:51:58,290 --> 00:52:00,496
[Jade colored ocean.]

809
00:52:00,913 --> 00:52:06,893
[Gorgeous scenic views from
the southern seas.]

810
00:52:06,894 --> 00:52:09,049
- Each team has one hint each...
- Yes.

811
00:52:09,050 --> 00:52:11,201
<i>Here is your next mission.</i>

812
00:52:11,202 --> 00:52:12,763
[What is their mission here?]

813
00:52:15,522 --> 00:52:17,480
- Kwang Soo, have some manners.
- Come on, Kwang Soo.

814
00:52:17,481 --> 00:52:20,599
- Didn't you see Ji Woo running up there?
- Seriously...

815
00:52:20,937 --> 00:52:22,639
<i>[Queen of dodge ball....]</i>

816
00:52:24,107 --> 00:52:27,304
<i>[If you hit the opposing team's Queen,
then your team wins the game.]</i>

817
00:52:28,454 --> 00:52:31,788
<i>If your team's Queen is hit,
then your team is immediately out.</i>

818
00:52:31,789 --> 00:52:32,994
<i>However...</i>

819
00:52:32,995 --> 00:52:36,415
<i>There's bound to be one man who's
going to remain guarding the Queen.</i>

820
00:52:36,415 --> 00:52:38,883
<i>And that man can't be ousted
no matter how many times he gets hit.</i>

821
00:52:38,884 --> 00:52:41,713
[Last man left will become invincible!]

822
00:52:41,713 --> 00:52:47,684
[The last man left will have to use his
whole body to protect the Queen!]

823
00:52:48,228 --> 00:52:52,718
[And the team that wins two games
out of three will gain the final hint!]

824
00:52:52,718 --> 00:52:56,059
- Put Ji Woo in the back. Behind all of us.
- I'm really bad at Dodge ball.

825
00:52:56,060 --> 00:52:58,077
- It's a very fast moving game.
- You have to avoid the ball.

826
00:52:59,641 --> 00:53:01,798
- Fighting!
- Fighting!

827
00:53:03,493 --> 00:53:05,692
<i>We have to protect Ji Woo.</i>

828
00:53:05,693 --> 00:53:09,728
[The team to run out and grab the ball at
the sound of the whistle is the offense team.]

829
00:53:09,729 --> 00:53:11,735
<i>The team to grab the ball is the
first to be on the offense.</i>

830
00:53:11,736 --> 00:53:14,451
<i>Jong Kook! His foot is over the line!</i>

831
00:53:16,650 --> 00:53:18,873
<i>The kids are watching you guys.
Play clean.</i>

832
00:53:18,874 --> 00:53:20,556
[Trying to cheat when these precious
and innocent kids are watching?]

833
00:53:21,891 --> 00:53:23,696
Sorry! I'm sorry.

834
00:53:23,697 --> 00:53:27,503
- I'm sorry, kids!
- Come on... seriously!

835
00:53:27,504 --> 00:53:30,105
- Let's play fair, okay?
- Ready...

836
00:53:30,106 --> 00:53:34,834
[Queen Dodge ball - Start!]

837
00:53:39,253 --> 00:53:41,350
You have to oust him! Oust him!
What are you doing!

838
00:53:42,843 --> 00:53:46,469
[The point of the game is to protect
their Queen to the end.]

839
00:53:46,470 --> 00:53:48,252
Look at you standing there
all by yourself.

840
00:53:48,253 --> 00:53:50,472
Are you going to throw that my way?

841
00:53:54,130 --> 00:53:57,133
[Team Ji Woo's Kwang Soo is ousted
in the blink of an eye!]

842
00:53:57,762 --> 00:54:00,048
[Gary definitely shows his strengths
when it comes down to the wire.]

843
00:54:00,049 --> 00:54:03,382
- We have to oust someone over there.
- Yeah, since one of our own is already out.

844
00:54:05,401 --> 00:54:07,514
Catch it.... catch the ball.
Maybe it's better that he's ousted.

845
00:54:08,094 --> 00:54:10,260
[What are you doing?]

846
00:54:13,113 --> 00:54:14,314
What is he doing?

847
00:54:14,315 --> 00:54:16,753
[Wow! It worked!
Ssam-Di is out!]

848
00:54:16,754 --> 00:54:19,276
- Why did you just stand there?
- It worked! I got him!

849
00:54:19,277 --> 00:54:21,019
[Kwang Soo's spin shot worked!]

850
00:54:21,020 --> 00:54:24,186
<i>Lee Kwang Soo! Lee Kwang Soo!</i>

851
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:27,549
[He's having a field day.]

852
00:54:27,550 --> 00:54:30,367
<i>Lee Kwang Soo! Lee Kwang Soo!</i>

853
00:54:34,871 --> 00:54:37,369
[Team Ji Woo's Jae Suk, Out!]

854
00:54:42,845 --> 00:54:46,189
[And immediately following,
Team Ji Woo's Suk Jin, Out!]

855
00:54:46,664 --> 00:54:49,964
[Team Ji Hyo still has
plenty of men survivors.]

856
00:54:51,546 --> 00:54:53,819
Over here... here!

857
00:54:54,673 --> 00:54:56,410
[A hit on Jong Hyun.]

858
00:54:56,780 --> 00:54:59,170
[Team Ji Hyo's Jong Hyun, Out!]

859
00:54:59,171 --> 00:55:01,750
- It could be better to be on the outside.
- Didn't you see how he was ousted?

860
00:55:01,751 --> 00:55:03,992
- Yeah, it may be better to be outside.
- Get it back to me.

861
00:55:04,530 --> 00:55:07,874
[Team Ji Woo quickly making the pass
back to their own side.]

862
00:55:07,875 --> 00:55:09,875
Quickly! Make the pass!

863
00:55:09,876 --> 00:55:12,004
Pass the ball! that's right!

864
00:55:12,472 --> 00:55:13,984
[Team Ji Hyo's Ki Kwang, Out!]

865
00:55:17,506 --> 00:55:20,865
[Jong Kook is ousted
while trying to protect Ji Woo!]

866
00:55:20,866 --> 00:55:24,342
[Final man left standing on
Team Ji Woo, Haroro.]

867
00:55:24,343 --> 00:55:30,306
[Rule - Final man left remaining is invincible.
Protect the Queen no matter what it takes.]

868
00:55:30,306 --> 00:55:32,791
Ha Ha! You have to oust Ji Hyo
before they're down to one man!

869
00:55:36,490 --> 00:55:38,806
[Team Ji Hyo in danger!]

870
00:55:42,185 --> 00:55:45,498
[Hong Hwa throws his body in the way
and protects his Queen Ji Hyo!]

871
00:55:47,268 --> 00:55:49,649
Ultimately, it's down to Gary and Ji Hyo!

872
00:55:49,650 --> 00:55:51,572
[Queen Ji Woo's bodyguard, Ha Ha.]

873
00:55:51,572 --> 00:55:53,770
[Queen Ji Hyo's bodyguard, Gary.]

874
00:55:53,771 --> 00:55:55,762
- Pass it! Pass it!
- Kwang Soo! Over here!

875
00:55:55,763 --> 00:55:57,198
<i>Kwang Soo! This way!</i>

876
00:55:59,770 --> 00:56:03,172
[Their plans of confusing their opponent
by passing the ball quickly around.]

877
00:56:04,575 --> 00:56:05,802
Kwang Soo!

878
00:56:07,303 --> 00:56:09,526
- Kwang Soo!
- Ha Ha!

879
00:56:12,102 --> 00:56:13,854
[See ya!]

880
00:56:13,855 --> 00:56:16,952
[No!]

881
00:56:21,492 --> 00:56:23,427
[Another opportunity!]

882
00:56:25,550 --> 00:56:28,651
[Ji Hyo must be protected!]

883
00:56:30,892 --> 00:56:35,958
[In a dangerous situation...
using his head to make the block!]

884
00:56:39,528 --> 00:56:43,616
[Going back to the plan of trying to
confuse Team Ji Hyo once again.]

885
00:56:43,617 --> 00:56:46,527
[Impossible to predict who will be
making the throw!]

886
00:56:46,528 --> 00:56:48,738
You guys are too fast!

887
00:56:51,967 --> 00:56:54,256
[Gary barely makes the block
with his arm!]

888
00:56:55,900 --> 00:56:57,678
[Uses his body to make
the block again!]

889
00:56:57,678 --> 00:57:01,191
[And the offense changes side!]

890
00:57:02,594 --> 00:57:04,338
[You just wait and see.]

891
00:57:04,339 --> 00:57:06,552
<i>Let's just see how this goes!</i>

892
00:57:10,668 --> 00:57:13,874
[An opportunity!]

893
00:57:16,756 --> 00:57:18,872
[By the skin on his teeth!]

894
00:57:39,375 --> 00:57:40,938
Do you remember me?

895
00:57:45,845 --> 00:57:48,274
- Take your best shot.
- You cannot be forgiven.

896
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:52,438
A short stature!

897
00:57:53,282 --> 00:57:56,674
[Another shorty besides
'Dodge ball Tong-Ki'.]

898
00:57:56,675 --> 00:57:58,406
Dodge ball Ton-ki...

899
00:57:58,407 --> 00:58:01,285
<i>Ha Ha! Ha Ha!</i>

900
00:58:12,085 --> 00:58:14,613
[What the heck was that?]

901
00:58:15,267 --> 00:58:16,970
[Utter disappointment.]

902
00:58:22,252 --> 00:58:24,907
- He was trying to channel Ton-Ki.
- He should've thrown it better.

903
00:58:25,272 --> 00:58:28,225
[Team Ji Woo continues their plans of
confusing Team Ji Hyo with their passes.]

904
00:58:29,065 --> 00:58:30,763
[Just then!]

905
00:58:30,763 --> 00:58:36,308
[Jae Suk eyes the space between
Gary's legs and takes his shot!]

906
00:58:50,589 --> 00:58:52,925
[Hits Ji Hyo directly on her foot!]

907
00:58:54,961 --> 00:58:58,951
[First round of Queen Dodge ball
is Team Ji Woo's win!]

908
00:58:58,952 --> 00:59:04,384
[Queen Dodge ball - Two out of three.
Team Ji Hyo: 0, Team Ji Woo: 1]

909
00:59:04,385 --> 00:59:07,262
Let's win this.
Let's finish the game right now.

910
00:59:07,263 --> 00:59:09,232
- Let's win.
- Let's win this round.

911
00:59:09,233 --> 00:59:12,815
[Team Ji Hyo making a vow to
win the round.]

912
00:59:12,816 --> 00:59:13,972
<i>Fighting!</i>

913
00:59:13,973 --> 00:59:17,146
[Just which team will receive the final hint?]

914
00:59:17,146 --> 00:59:18,557
We have to get the hint.

915
00:59:18,557 --> 00:59:20,270
<i>I'd like to be clear that
once you get this hint</i>

916
00:59:20,271 --> 00:59:22,340
<i>the person who chose the card will
know for sure that they're the snake.</i>

917
00:59:22,341 --> 00:59:24,535
[Very possible for the person who chose the
snake that they're the one with this hint.]

918
00:59:24,535 --> 00:59:26,602
You guys watch yourselves.
Jong Kook is going for the ball this time.

919
00:59:26,603 --> 00:59:28,417
We're not guaranteeing your
safety anymore.

920
00:59:28,418 --> 00:59:32,155
I'm warning you. It's possible
I may even break your teeth.

921
00:59:32,156 --> 00:59:34,514
<i>- Be careful, got it?
- We've given you fair warning.</i>

922
00:59:34,515 --> 00:59:37,846
<i>- You watch yourselves, got it?
- I'm being nice by giving you this warning.</i>

923
00:59:39,042 --> 00:59:42,414
[Prepare for the second round...]

924
00:59:43,507 --> 00:59:46,130
[Overflowing with eagerness.]

925
01:00:06,349 --> 01:00:11,368
[Gets hurt for running out on the field
like a crazy man all by himself.]

926
01:00:12,476 --> 01:00:13,930
<i>None of those guys ran out.</i>

927
01:00:14,529 --> 01:00:16,351
<i>Why didn't any of you
guys come out?</i>

928
01:00:16,705 --> 01:00:20,308
- Don't you guys think you were too much?
- You have to compete for the ball!

929
01:00:21,578 --> 01:00:25,061
[All they did was not run out to the field
in case they may get hurt in the process.]

930
01:00:25,062 --> 01:00:27,453
Didn't you see him run out with his teeth
gritted in an attempt to beat you guys?

931
01:00:27,453 --> 01:00:29,262
Look! My pants are torn!

932
01:00:29,263 --> 01:00:31,132
There's a rip on my knee!

933
01:00:31,723 --> 01:00:34,253
[While even tearing up his pants.]

934
01:00:34,254 --> 01:00:36,470
Ugh... he's so embarrassing!

935
01:00:36,471 --> 01:00:39,842
- You're embarrassing us.
- We'll take a picture of this spot.

936
01:00:40,317 --> 01:00:43,212
[Is this the scene of a car accident?]

937
01:00:43,212 --> 01:00:46,157
[Clear tire marks.]

938
01:00:46,888 --> 01:00:51,199
[A light fender-bender caused by
some skidding on the slippery road.]

939
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:54,250
We all need to be careful of slippery
roads with these winter conditions.

940
01:00:54,251 --> 01:00:56,210
[Running Man Campaign]

941
01:00:56,210 --> 01:00:58,719
[Driving in icy conditions -
Let's become slow as turtles.]

942
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:01,547
<i>- Everyone, please drive safely.
- Drive slow on the roads.</i>

943
01:01:01,548 --> 01:01:04,173
- Use caution.
- I can't believe they didn't come out.

944
01:01:05,881 --> 01:01:08,644
[Queen Dodge ball, Second round starts now!]

945
01:01:16,073 --> 01:01:20,198
[Jae Suk on the attack is a
figure of terror.]

946
01:01:20,199 --> 01:01:24,117
[But when he's on the defense... huh?]

947
01:01:24,118 --> 01:01:28,627
[Staying in safety by using
Giraffe as his shield?]

948
01:01:29,612 --> 01:01:31,407
Let go! Let go of me!

949
01:01:31,408 --> 01:01:33,546
Let go! Let go of me!

950
01:01:35,802 --> 01:01:37,499
Nice... this is nice team play!

951
01:01:38,023 --> 01:01:42,102
[You call using someone else as a shield
in order to survive, team play?]

952
01:01:42,590 --> 01:01:45,446
[Giraffe becoming a sacrificial lamb
for the sake of his own team.]

953
01:01:47,974 --> 01:01:50,380
[Team Ji Hyo on the attack.]

954
01:01:50,380 --> 01:01:52,355
[Team Ji Woo's counterattack!]

955
01:01:54,583 --> 01:01:56,894
[Out! Yong Hwa fails to catch
the ball and drops it.]

956
01:01:57,913 --> 01:02:00,554
[Gary responds to it by
firing the ball immediately!]

957
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:04,912
[Directly hits Giraffe on the face.]

958
01:02:04,913 --> 01:02:08,820
[Giraffe bursts out in anger.]

959
01:02:11,112 --> 01:02:15,612
[Unsure of who threw the ball at him.]

960
01:02:15,613 --> 01:02:18,407
<i>Gary! Hey, it was Gary!</i>

961
01:02:19,101 --> 01:02:21,206
[Discovers Gary!]

962
01:02:28,839 --> 01:02:31,552
I can't believe you have two hot packs
on just so you can stay warm by yourself!

963
01:02:31,980 --> 01:02:36,154
[Shouldn't have taken off your clothes.
Now you just look like a cheating scoundrel.]

964
01:02:36,155 --> 01:02:38,661
You should've shared one with
Suk Jin and Ji Woo!

965
01:02:39,154 --> 01:02:41,159
Forget it! Here.

966
01:02:42,330 --> 01:02:45,358
[Anyways, Kwang Soo from
Team Ji Woo is out!]

967
01:02:47,373 --> 01:02:51,063
[Oh no! They now realize they let
their guard down way too much!]

968
01:02:53,618 --> 01:02:56,337
[Team Ji Woo's Jong Kook is ousted!]

969
01:02:56,338 --> 01:02:58,177
Oh my... that scared me!

970
01:03:02,710 --> 01:03:05,670
[You can't even catch that?]

971
01:03:08,749 --> 01:03:10,716
[So close...]

972
01:03:14,769 --> 01:03:19,581
[Almost got into big trouble no thanks
to the mistake on Mr. Capable's part.]

973
01:03:19,582 --> 01:03:21,628
- Where's Ji Woo? Keep an eye on her.
- I'm back here.

974
01:03:23,928 --> 01:03:25,732
- Watch Ji Woo!
- Oh no!

975
01:03:27,956 --> 01:03:30,238
[An opportunity!]

976
01:03:33,270 --> 01:03:37,051
[Jae Suk instinctively throws himself to
protect his Queen and is ousted!]

977
01:03:37,052 --> 01:03:38,836
Okay... good!

978
01:03:38,837 --> 01:03:42,111
[This time, Ha Ha
aggressively protects Ji Woo!]

979
01:03:43,262 --> 01:03:44,681
[Nice moves, Ha Ha!]

980
01:03:44,681 --> 01:03:47,762
[Wait... then this means...]

981
01:03:47,762 --> 01:03:49,680
What... I'm the one left remaining?

982
01:03:50,710 --> 01:03:53,948
[The last man left remaining for
Team Ji Woo is Ji Suk Jin?]

983
01:03:57,563 --> 01:04:01,408
<i>Big-nose! Big-nose! Big-nose!</i>

984
01:04:04,176 --> 01:04:05,912
I'm your bodyguard.

985
01:04:12,548 --> 01:04:14,258
You hit me in the jugular!

986
01:04:15,578 --> 01:04:17,994
[Becoming the neighborhood
beating drum.]

987
01:04:17,995 --> 01:04:19,715
- Keep throwing it!
- Don't stop throwing it!

988
01:04:22,457 --> 01:04:23,568
You're doing great!

989
01:04:31,487 --> 01:04:34,201
[Team Ji Hyo's Ki Kwang sacrifices himself
to give his team the chance to attack.]

990
01:04:40,085 --> 01:04:43,021
[Of all places to take the hit...]

991
01:04:43,022 --> 01:04:47,425
<i>It's okay! It's okay!
It's okay! </i>

992
01:04:51,943 --> 01:04:54,979
[Team Ji Woo slowly starting their
plan of confusion with the passing.]

993
01:04:54,979 --> 01:04:56,892
[Then stops for a sudden attack!]

994
01:04:57,813 --> 01:05:00,189
[Team Ji Hyo's Ssam-Di is out!]

995
01:05:04,918 --> 01:05:06,433
<i>I thought Gary was going to be
ousted with that hit too.</i>

996
01:05:06,434 --> 01:05:10,237
[Big-nosed Brother's opportunity
to attack!]

997
01:05:10,237 --> 01:05:13,054
[A direct hit on Jong Hyun's hand!]

998
01:05:14,714 --> 01:05:17,735
[Once again, Gary is the last man
remaining on Team Ji Hyo!]

999
01:05:17,736 --> 01:05:21,213
[Guard Gary vs. Guard Big-nose.]

1000
01:05:26,213 --> 01:05:28,223
[A hit like that is no longer
a big deal.]

1001
01:05:31,281 --> 01:05:35,201
[Tries to further the attack
by confusing his vision. However...]

1002
01:05:37,950 --> 01:05:41,357
[The one gets the short end of the stick
is once again, Big-nosed Brother.]

1003
01:05:41,357 --> 01:05:45,659
[It seems as though he's just
been hit at the same spot again.]

1004
01:05:47,801 --> 01:05:51,568
[It's not even as if he can lie down
in pain with the kids watching.]

1005
01:05:53,408 --> 01:05:55,564
[Team Ji Woo is once again
back on the attack.]

1006
01:06:03,655 --> 01:06:07,293
[Already at the point of exhaustion?
Falling while trying to get the ball...]

1007
01:06:16,646 --> 01:06:21,878
[Anyway, Big-nosed Brother proving himself
to be a better blocker than expected!]

1008
01:06:23,810 --> 01:06:28,136
[What is the Tiger and the Giraffe
up to all of a sudden?]

1009
01:06:28,136 --> 01:06:29,769
Are you about to do what I think
you're about to do?

1010
01:06:30,294 --> 01:06:32,014
I have been waiting for this movement.

1011
01:06:32,782 --> 01:06:36,225
- Come at me, Kang Gary!
- Is it the move that stops my heart in fear?

1012
01:06:36,225 --> 01:06:39,885
Lightening... shoot!

1013
01:06:47,728 --> 01:06:51,980
[Fails at the blast off from
the lack of teamwork.]

1014
01:06:51,981 --> 01:06:53,660
<i>What was that just now?</i>

1015
01:06:54,723 --> 01:06:58,337
[Second attempt at the lightening shot.
This time, The Tiger gets down on his knee.]

1016
01:06:58,338 --> 01:06:59,806
Lightening!

1017
01:07:00,447 --> 01:07:01,852
Don't step on me too hard, okay?

1018
01:07:06,938 --> 01:07:10,966
[Game or not, Giraffe is on full out assault
from all the built up resentment and anger.]

1019
01:07:11,725 --> 01:07:13,678
<i>What are you guys doing?</i>

1020
01:07:19,078 --> 01:07:22,596
[But just then!]

1021
01:07:22,596 --> 01:07:28,774
[Killer Jae Suk targets the legs again
and makes his throw!]

1022
01:07:31,484 --> 01:07:35,727
[Wow! A direct hit on
Queen Ji Hyo's leg!]

1023
01:07:35,728 --> 01:07:40,007
[Queen Dodge ball, Two out of three.
Team Ji Hyo: 0, Team Ji Woo: 2.]

1024
01:07:41,460 --> 01:07:44,258
[Into the cries from the crowd.]

1025
01:07:46,405 --> 01:07:48,976
[A nice play toy for the children.]

1026
01:07:54,013 --> 01:07:58,742
[Third mission,
Queen Dodge ball - Team Ji Woo wins!]

1027
01:07:58,742 --> 01:08:05,804
[The final hint regarding who chose
the snake zodiac sign is given to the team.]

1028
01:08:06,742 --> 01:08:08,887
<i>- Wow... it's radish california rolls.
- Yum...</i>

1029
01:08:08,888 --> 01:08:10,411
<i>Enjoy your meal!</i>

1030
01:08:10,412 --> 01:08:16,068
[The original taste of the california rolls
being enjoyed in a classroom setting.]

1031
01:08:17,026 --> 01:08:21,865
[An unbeatable taste combined with
spicy radish kimchi, squid and calamari.]

1032
01:08:21,866 --> 01:08:24,292
I thought it was just some calamari
and radish in there... but squid too?

1033
01:08:26,193 --> 01:08:28,762
[Team Ji Hyo is also enjoying
their delicious lunch.]

1034
01:08:30,591 --> 01:08:35,526
[Checking the hint they just gained
in the middle of their lunch.]

1035
01:08:39,105 --> 01:08:41,953
[Just what does their final hint say?]

1036
01:08:42,397 --> 01:08:46,625
[Min Hyo Rin.]

1037
01:08:47,235 --> 01:08:51,724
[Team Ji Woo's second hint, Min Hyo Rin
following their first clue of Yoo Jin.]

1038
01:08:52,328 --> 01:08:56,122
[Either she was in the same project as
the person who chose the snake card...]

1039
01:08:56,917 --> 01:09:01,603
[The only person who's been in the
same project as Min Hyo Rin is Ji Hyo.]

1040
01:09:01,603 --> 01:09:03,829
- The snake could be someone on our team too.
- Yeah, you're right.

1041
01:09:03,830 --> 01:09:05,859
We have to stop thinking that it could
only be someone on the other team.

1042
01:09:06,345 --> 01:09:11,738
[The deduction continuing on
after their lunch.]

1043
01:09:11,739 --> 01:09:13,003
I looked up some stuff.

1044
01:09:13,004 --> 01:09:14,511
I started the search by
looking up Min Hyo Rin.

1045
01:09:14,512 --> 01:09:17,906
After trying Min Hyo Rin with some others,
and when I did Min Hyo Rin and Lee Ki Kwang...

1046
01:09:17,906 --> 01:09:19,293
the search results showed
that they once did a kissing scene.

1047
01:09:19,294 --> 01:09:21,038
Was that all?

1048
01:09:21,039 --> 01:09:23,674
- What about Yoo Jin?
- I searched Yoo Jin and Lee Ki Kwang.

1049
01:09:23,675 --> 01:09:27,400
And when I did, singer Yoo Jin had
a song with Ki Kwang as a featured artist.

1050
01:09:28,118 --> 01:09:29,901
But don't you think that would
make it way too simple and obvious?

1051
01:09:29,902 --> 01:09:33,525
- That's true. That could be.
- I searched other guys too.

1052
01:09:33,526 --> 01:09:36,620
- When I searched Yong Hwa, I got nothing.
- So Ki Kwang got the most hits?

1053
01:09:36,620 --> 01:09:40,941
[For the moment, Ki Kwang has the
highest likelihood of being the snake?]

1054
01:09:40,942 --> 01:09:42,447
I don't think it's Ki Kwang.

1055
01:09:42,448 --> 01:09:44,370
I wish that it was Ki Kwang.

1056
01:09:44,371 --> 01:09:47,689
- I don't have the slightest clue.
- It's not you, is it, Ji Woo?

1057
01:09:47,690 --> 01:09:51,119
- Right? You and Min Hyo Rin...
- Any association between you and Min Hyo Rin?

1058
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:52,804
I have nothing to do with her
whatsoever.

1059
01:09:52,805 --> 01:09:55,598
If you think that you may be, you
have to tell us so we can protect you.

1060
01:09:57,441 --> 01:10:01,425
[Team Ji's main suspect, Ki Kwang.]

1061
01:10:01,426 --> 01:10:05,121
You don't think Ji Woo did any
figure skating in the past, do you?

1062
01:10:05,122 --> 01:10:06,177
I doubt it.

1063
01:10:06,178 --> 01:10:08,763
What about 'Stairway to Heaven'?

1064
01:10:09,645 --> 01:10:13,185
- In 'Stairway to Heaven'...
- Was there skating in there?

1065
01:10:13,186 --> 01:10:15,357
There's a scene where she's
figure skating.

1066
01:10:15,358 --> 01:10:18,306
- Really?
- Ji Woo skates in 'Stairway to Heaven'.

1067
01:10:19,357 --> 01:10:24,172
[Now that they think about it,
there was this scene...]

1068
01:10:24,173 --> 01:10:29,142
Then, wait a second...
For now... let's focus on Ji Woo for now.

1069
01:10:29,143 --> 01:10:30,225
[Team Ji Hyo focusing on Choi Ji Woo
as their main suspect for now.]

1070
01:10:30,707 --> 01:10:33,759
What if they're using Kim Yeon Ah
as a hint for 'Winter Sonata'?

1071
01:10:33,760 --> 01:10:35,764
Then that would mean Ji Woo...

1072
01:10:36,532 --> 01:10:42,396
[Ki Kwang's guess is Ji Woo.
Is one of the two the snake?]

1073
01:10:44,439 --> 01:10:47,652
[Final mission location - Jangsa Island]

1074
01:10:47,652 --> 01:10:51,775
[With 400m in width and 1.9 km of roads,
the resemblance to a snake gave it its name.]

1075
01:10:54,239 --> 01:11:00,249
[Snake island... The perfect place to
greet 2013, the year of the snake.]

1076
01:11:02,332 --> 01:11:04,760
<i>We will now start our final race.</i>

1077
01:11:04,761 --> 01:11:07,885
<i>If you can last the entire hour
that is given to you...</i>

1078
01:11:07,886 --> 01:11:09,910
<i>then the team that lasts during
the time given will be the winning team.</i>

1079
01:11:10,751 --> 01:11:11,877
<i>Otherwise... </i>

1080
01:11:11,878 --> 01:11:13,923
<i>without any regards to who gets ousted</i>

1081
01:11:13,924 --> 01:11:16,190
<i>the moment that the snake gets ousted,
it's game over.</i>

1082
01:11:16,191 --> 01:11:18,531
- Yes, we understand.
- But was that it for our hint?

1083
01:11:18,983 --> 01:11:21,727
- You're not giving us any more hints?
- It sounds like you don't know who it is?

1084
01:11:21,728 --> 01:11:24,144
[Team Ji Woo - Yoo Jin and Min Hyo Rin.
Team Ji Hyo - Kim Yeon Ah.]

1085
01:11:26,482 --> 01:11:30,585
[Attaching the animal that they each chose
earlier on their backs under their names.]

1086
01:11:30,585 --> 01:11:35,390
[Just which one of them chose the snake
and now has the snake on their back?]

1087
01:11:36,239 --> 01:11:38,803
Once you already rip it off,
it doesn't stick as well again.

1088
01:11:42,054 --> 01:11:43,589
<i>We're all set now.</i>

1089
01:11:43,589 --> 01:11:47,344
[All the members with the animals they chose
now attached firmly to their backs!]

1090
01:11:48,004 --> 01:11:52,754
[Trying to determine whether the snake is
on their team or on the opponent's team...]

1091
01:11:53,444 --> 01:11:57,127
[Team Ji Hyo decides to protect Yong Hwa and
Ki Kwang while attacking their opponent.]

1092
01:11:57,127 --> 01:11:59,690
Let's protect them while we attack
the other team at the same time.

1093
01:12:01,610 --> 01:12:04,281
[Final mission starts now!]

1094
01:12:04,281 --> 01:12:05,391
The important thing is...

1095
01:12:05,391 --> 01:12:09,268
[Team Ji Woo brimming with confidence from
their knowledge at how the game's played.]

1096
01:12:10,291 --> 01:12:12,931
[Find the snake!]

1097
01:12:17,188 --> 01:12:21,295
[The Tiger and the Giraffe's
sudden cutthroat sparring.]

1098
01:12:22,047 --> 01:12:25,761
- Look at you... you've learned.
- Of course... I can even attack now.

1099
01:12:30,265 --> 01:12:32,161
[Breaking Kwang Soo's zipper.]

1100
01:12:32,161 --> 01:12:36,842
- You always take playing around too far.
- You attacked me first and I just countered!

1101
01:12:36,842 --> 01:12:39,321
But you're warmed up now, right?
Loose and warmed up.

1102
01:12:39,322 --> 01:12:44,478
[Tiger and the Giraffe overflowing
with eagerness in the new year.]

1103
01:12:45,805 --> 01:12:49,690
For some reason, I feel like the snake
is one of our own team members.

1104
01:12:52,172 --> 01:12:55,608
- Wow... this is unbelievable.
- This is amazing.

1105
01:12:55,908 --> 01:13:01,204
[The beauty of our ocean seen
from atop Jangsa Island.]

1106
01:13:02,948 --> 01:13:07,220
[Like a painting that shows the blue sky
meeting the sparkling ocean in the horizon.]

1107
01:13:07,220 --> 01:13:10,151
<i>Wow... this is so amazing!</i>

1108
01:13:10,151 --> 01:13:11,269
<i>- This is just amazing.
- Doesn't it look like a picture?</i>

1109
01:13:14,261 --> 01:13:17,114
[Losing themselves in the beauty
of their surroundings.]

1110
01:13:22,956 --> 01:13:27,537
[Soaking in the energy of 2013.]

1111
01:13:27,538 --> 01:13:29,583
- This feels so spiritual.
- Doesn't it feel amazing?

1112
01:13:29,584 --> 01:13:35,120
[No matter where they look,
everything looks so picturesque...]

1113
01:13:40,016 --> 01:13:45,319
[Suspect Ki Kwang slipping away while
everyone else is busy sightseeing.]

1114
01:13:46,012 --> 01:13:49,709
- I just hope I don't run into Jong Kook.
- You're going to run into him sometime.

1115
01:13:50,938 --> 01:13:52,880
If we run into him,
we have to make a deal with him.

1116
01:13:55,261 --> 01:13:56,690
Suk Jin!

1117
01:13:56,691 --> 01:13:59,257
How about we make a trade?

1118
01:13:59,258 --> 01:14:00,671
- Hey...
- Trade what?

1119
01:14:00,672 --> 01:14:02,262
- The hints.
- Let's trade.

1120
01:14:02,263 --> 01:14:05,218
- Should we trade? What is it?
- Yes, let's trade.

1121
01:14:06,194 --> 01:14:09,829
- You have to tell us one first.
- Why? Then let's play Paper-Rock-Scissors.

1122
01:14:11,033 --> 01:14:14,625
- It's because we only have one.
- We'll have to pick which one to give you.

1123
01:14:15,249 --> 01:14:16,875
Wait! I'll tell you.

1124
01:14:16,876 --> 01:14:19,133
- Give them the first one.
- I'll let you know one. It's Yoo Jin.

1125
01:14:19,134 --> 01:14:21,168
I'll give you one. It's Yoo Jin.

1126
01:14:21,817 --> 01:14:23,304
Yoo Jin?

1127
01:14:24,398 --> 01:14:28,205
[Team Ji Hyo trying to make a deduction with
their two clues, Kim Yeon Ah and Yoo Jin.]

1128
01:14:29,057 --> 01:14:30,972
- Yoo Jin. What's yours?
- It's really Yoo Jin?

1129
01:14:30,973 --> 01:14:32,759
- Are you being honest?
- Yeah, it really is Yoo Jin.

1130
01:14:32,759 --> 01:14:34,646
<i>We told you already! It really is.</i>

1131
01:14:34,647 --> 01:14:37,876
- Let's both say it at the count of three.
- One, two, three!

1132
01:14:37,877 --> 01:14:40,465
- Yoo Jin!
- Kim Yeon Ah!

1133
01:14:42,126 --> 01:14:43,667
Kim Yeon Ah?

1134
01:14:43,668 --> 01:14:46,644
[Team Ji Woo's hints -
Yoo Jin, Min Hyo Rin, Kim Yeon Ah.]

1135
01:14:46,645 --> 01:14:48,446
What does Kim Yeon Ah, Yoo Jin and
Min Hyo Rin have to do with one another?

1136
01:14:48,447 --> 01:14:50,988
[Team Ji Woo falling into
state of greater confusion.]

1137
01:14:51,674 --> 01:14:53,006
- What is it?
- Did you figure something out?

1138
01:14:53,007 --> 01:14:55,270
[Did Ji Woo figure something out?]

1139
01:14:55,271 --> 01:14:57,443
Min Hyo Rin and Kim Yeon Ah
both skate.

1140
01:14:57,444 --> 01:15:00,451
- Min Hyo Rin was in a skating drama.
- You're right! She was in 'Triple'!

1141
01:15:00,451 --> 01:15:02,071
- She was in 'Triple'.
- What else?

1142
01:15:02,071 --> 01:15:04,016
Min Hyo Rin was in 'Triple'.

1143
01:15:04,017 --> 01:15:07,615
Min Hyo Rin was in a drama about skating
and Kim Yeon Ah is a skater.

1144
01:15:07,616 --> 01:15:10,216
- What about Yoo Jin?
- Yoo Jin? I don't know about Yoo Jin.

1145
01:15:10,829 --> 01:15:12,772
They're both the same age.

1146
01:15:12,773 --> 01:15:15,804
- Ki Kwang and Kim Yeon Ah are the same age.
- They were both born in the same year.

1147
01:15:15,805 --> 01:15:17,520
This is part of the hint.

1148
01:15:17,521 --> 01:15:22,717
Even though we were confused earlier...
Kim Yeon Ah and Ki Kwang are the same signs.

1149
01:15:23,250 --> 01:15:25,683
- And...
- And there was the kiss scene.

1150
01:15:25,684 --> 01:15:29,282
- Hyo Rin had the kiss scene with him.
- And Yoo Jin had a song featuring him.

1151
01:15:29,283 --> 01:15:33,132
[The suspect for having the snake card
definitely is Ki Kwang!]

1152
01:15:33,133 --> 01:15:34,320
Let's go get him first.

1153
01:15:34,321 --> 01:15:37,178
- Hey... I think it's 'Winter Sonata'.
- Why?

1154
01:15:37,179 --> 01:15:38,648
They just said Yoo Jin, right?

1155
01:15:38,649 --> 01:15:42,544
Ji Woo's character was named Jung Yoo Jin
in the drama, 'Winter Sonata'.

1156
01:15:42,545 --> 01:15:48,234
And in my opinion, Kim Yeon Ah is a sort of
a word play on the title, 'Winter Sonata'.

1157
01:15:48,235 --> 01:15:50,268
- I think that's what it is.
- I think you're right.

1158
01:15:50,269 --> 01:15:53,772
[Team Ji Hyo is confirmed that the suspect
of having the snake card is Ji Woo!]

1159
01:15:53,772 --> 01:15:56,314
- For now, let's...
- What's the other clue?

1160
01:15:56,315 --> 01:15:57,938
- They didn't tell us the last one.
- They didn't tell us.

1161
01:15:57,939 --> 01:16:00,293
- I wish there's a way we could find out.
- We shouldn't have told them what it was.

1162
01:16:00,294 --> 01:16:03,412
- We should've told them it was Son Yeon Jae.
- Yeah, you should've told them Son Yeon Jae!

1163
01:16:03,413 --> 01:16:05,627
[We shouldn't have been honest and
told them that it was Kim Yeon Ah...]

1164
01:16:05,627 --> 01:16:08,341
[Maybe I should've told them
that it was Son Yeon Jae...]

1165
01:16:08,342 --> 01:16:09,643
But they were being honest with us...

1166
01:16:09,644 --> 01:16:13,139
But we don't know if they were being
honest with us about it being Yoo Jin either.

1167
01:16:13,140 --> 01:16:16,225
- You think they lied to us?
- What's the point of thinking that now?

1168
01:16:17,593 --> 01:16:19,914
- But they could've lied to us.
- We're ruined.

1169
01:16:20,747 --> 01:16:24,739
[Feeling as though they got the raw end
of the deal for having been honest.]

1170
01:16:25,585 --> 01:16:29,234
Anyway, let's start off by ripping
the name off of Ji Woo first.

1171
01:16:29,235 --> 01:16:30,900
- Let's oust Ji Woo first.
- Call.

1172
01:16:40,206 --> 01:16:42,394
There's no need to be considerate.

1173
01:16:44,619 --> 01:16:48,741
[Still unsure of who the snake
could be...]

1174
01:16:48,742 --> 01:16:50,638
But Kim Yeon Ah...

1175
01:16:51,565 --> 01:16:57,002
[Anyway, Team Ji Hyo suspects Ji Woo,
and Team Ji Woo is targeting Ki Kwang.]

1176
01:16:57,002 --> 01:17:02,287
[Imminent nerve-wrecking moment.]

1177
01:17:05,061 --> 01:17:09,197
[If they make a wrong move,
the mission could end this moment!]

1178
01:17:11,801 --> 01:17:13,271
Ssam-Di... Ssam-Di...

1179
01:17:19,507 --> 01:17:22,796
[Team Ji Hyo starting to
squeeze in on them.]

1180
01:17:22,796 --> 01:17:25,864
[Targeting Ji Woo and moving in on her.]

1181
01:17:26,911 --> 01:17:29,602
[At this rate,
they're going to get had!]

1182
01:17:30,638 --> 01:17:33,305
- What should I do? Should I run?
- Run... run!

1183
01:17:33,995 --> 01:17:36,773
[Team Ji Hyo starts their attack!]

1184
01:17:37,447 --> 01:17:39,951
[A surprise ambush - Attack Ki Kwang!]

1185
01:17:42,319 --> 01:17:44,491
[The name tag is in Jae Suk's hand!]

1186
01:17:47,518 --> 01:17:49,677
[Jae Suk eliminates Ki Kwang's name tag!]

1187
01:17:52,647 --> 01:17:55,813
[At the same time, Jong Hyun rids
Ha Ha of his name tag!]

1188
01:17:56,404 --> 01:18:00,710
[Which one of the 12 animal signs
does Ki Kwang have on his back?]

1189
01:18:00,710 --> 01:18:02,988
- What's Ha Ha?
- Monkey. He's a monkey.

1190
01:18:02,989 --> 01:18:04,714
[Ha Ha is a monkey.]

1191
01:18:05,021 --> 01:18:08,213
[Is Ki Kwang really the snake?]

1192
01:18:08,213 --> 01:18:12,325
[If Ki Kwang truly is the snake,
then Team Ji Woo wins!]

1193
01:18:17,592 --> 01:18:20,365
<i>- What's Ki Kwang?
- A rat?</i>

1194
01:18:22,291 --> 01:18:23,527
- A rat?
- He's a rat?

1195
01:18:23,528 --> 01:18:25,197
- He's not the snake?
- He's not the snake?

1196
01:18:25,198 --> 01:18:29,701
[Ki Kwang is not the snake!
Ki Kwang's chosen card is the rat.]

1197
01:18:29,702 --> 01:18:31,752
All this time, we all thought it
was Ki Kwang.

1198
01:18:31,753 --> 01:18:35,383
[It seemed a sure thing that all the hints
pointed to Ki Kwang. How could this be...]

1199
01:18:35,384 --> 01:18:38,009
- This makes no sense!
- How can this be?

1200
01:18:39,313 --> 01:18:41,347
- What if it's one of us?
- It's not Ki Kwang?

1201
01:18:42,584 --> 01:18:44,547
I was sure that it was Ki Kwang.

1202
01:18:44,548 --> 01:18:47,360
You and Min Hyo Rin...

1203
01:18:49,671 --> 01:18:53,610
[Mentioning Min Hyo Rin
which Team Ji Hyo isn't aware of...]

1204
01:18:53,610 --> 01:18:56,085
[You idiot!]

1205
01:18:56,086 --> 01:18:58,811
Wait... why are you telling him that?

1206
01:18:58,812 --> 01:19:01,436
- Make sure that he doesn't say anything.
- Keep quiet on your way to jail.

1207
01:19:01,437 --> 01:19:03,218
You can't say anything, okay?

1208
01:19:05,486 --> 01:19:07,385
<i>Min Hyo Rin! Min Hyo Rin!</i>

1209
01:19:08,244 --> 01:19:09,914
Min Hyo Rin!

1210
01:19:09,915 --> 01:19:11,914
Hey! You can't tell them that!

1211
01:19:11,915 --> 01:19:13,771
- What are you doing?
- Min Hyo Rin!

1212
01:19:13,772 --> 01:19:16,307
[Ki Kwang passes on the hint that he got
from Kwang Soo to his team members.]

1213
01:19:17,314 --> 01:19:18,582
<i>- What are you doing?
- Min Hyo Rin!</i>

1214
01:19:18,582 --> 01:19:19,831
Min Hyo Rin?

1215
01:19:20,423 --> 01:19:22,532
You can't tell them that!
What the heck?

1216
01:19:23,288 --> 01:19:26,703
[Min Hyo Rin?]

1217
01:19:27,718 --> 01:19:30,826
It's all your fault!
Why did you have to tell him that?

1218
01:19:30,827 --> 01:19:33,191
Just what in the world is the
matter with you?

1219
01:19:33,192 --> 01:19:36,898
- I was just asking if he and Hyo Rin...
- Why would you say that?

1220
01:19:36,899 --> 01:19:39,767
- You told him that?
- You really did ruin it all.

1221
01:19:39,768 --> 01:19:42,380
Seriously!
Why did you tell him that?

1222
01:19:43,175 --> 01:19:45,417
Then doesn't it mean that the snake
could be a member of our own team?

1223
01:19:45,418 --> 01:19:49,227
[Now the suspect as to who the snake
could be once again is up in the air.]

1224
01:19:59,488 --> 01:20:01,281
Even though it is the name of
a celebrity...

1225
01:20:01,282 --> 01:20:04,527
couldn't it mean something else
other than a person's name?

1226
01:20:06,073 --> 01:20:08,197
There's Kim Yeon Ah...

1227
01:20:08,198 --> 01:20:10,813
- She's an athlete.
- It could not be the people we're thinking.

1228
01:20:10,814 --> 01:20:15,269
[It could not be the same people
that they're thinking of?]

1229
01:20:16,255 --> 01:20:19,702
- But Min Hyo Rin...
- I've never seen Yoo Jin skate.

1230
01:20:19,703 --> 01:20:23,334
[Not able to think of how all three
hints are related to one another.]

1231
01:20:23,335 --> 01:20:25,150
Even if I do think of how the three
hints are connected...

1232
01:20:25,151 --> 01:20:28,074
I don't know how the hints would be related
to one of the people on the other team.

1233
01:20:28,075 --> 01:20:31,304
[How the snake suspect and the hints
are related are what's most important.]

1234
01:20:31,304 --> 01:20:33,248
I seriously have no idea.

1235
01:20:34,934 --> 01:20:37,756
[Team Ji Hyo still eyeing Ji Woo.]

1236
01:20:40,131 --> 01:20:41,722
Who's down there?

1237
01:20:41,723 --> 01:20:46,061
Why can't you figure out who it is
even though you have all three hints?

1238
01:20:46,062 --> 01:20:47,283
They have no relation with one another.

1239
01:20:47,283 --> 01:20:48,969
No matter how we look at it,
we can't think of anything.

1240
01:20:48,970 --> 01:20:52,107
- We really can't think of anything.
- In that case, tell us your final hint.

1241
01:20:52,108 --> 01:20:53,872
- We can't do that.
- No, we can't do that.

1242
01:20:54,898 --> 01:20:55,986
No, not that.

1243
01:20:56,021 --> 01:20:58,229
[Tiger and the Giraffe stepping up
to the front lines.]

1244
01:20:58,792 --> 01:21:00,638
[Retreating for now.]

1245
01:21:02,246 --> 01:21:04,228
We need to corner them.

1246
01:21:04,752 --> 01:21:08,237
[Another imminent danger!]

1247
01:21:09,214 --> 01:21:10,395
Wait... wait...

1248
01:21:10,396 --> 01:21:14,529
[Everyone gathering around
the wide open space.]

1249
01:21:14,529 --> 01:21:17,579
- Are you guys on the offense or defense?
- We're on the defense.

1250
01:21:17,673 --> 01:21:22,590
Give us a chance...
to make our own deductions too.

1251
01:21:23,047 --> 01:21:26,281
But we can't...
come up with a guess ourselves either.

1252
01:21:26,282 --> 01:21:27,990
- No matter how we look at it, we can't.
- Really?

1253
01:21:28,479 --> 01:21:32,165
[Team Ji Hyo inching their way
towards Jae Suk?]

1254
01:21:32,166 --> 01:21:34,130
- Are you suspecting me right now?
- No... no.

1255
01:21:34,981 --> 01:21:37,138
[Just then...]

1256
01:21:37,138 --> 01:21:41,805
[Kwang Soo breaks out into
attack mode on Ji Hyo!]

1257
01:21:46,412 --> 01:21:48,535
[Ace Ji Hyo avoiding his attack
by sidestepping his move!]

1258
01:21:48,535 --> 01:21:53,055
[Instead... it's Kwang Soo
who comes into danger!]

1259
01:21:54,554 --> 01:21:57,548
[Kwang Soo, Out!]

1260
01:22:03,317 --> 01:22:05,430
[At the same time,
Gary attacks his target, Ji Woo!]

1261
01:22:07,399 --> 01:22:09,084
I got her! I got her!

1262
01:22:10,480 --> 01:22:13,334
[Ji Woo's not the snake either!]

1263
01:22:15,496 --> 01:22:18,055
[Jong Hyun is the rabbit.]

1264
01:22:18,055 --> 01:22:20,160
[And Kwang Soo's the ox.]

1265
01:22:20,161 --> 01:22:21,949
What? We still haven't found
the snake yet?

1266
01:22:21,950 --> 01:22:23,806
Seriously?

1267
01:22:23,807 --> 01:22:27,294
[Just which one of the remaining
survivors is the snake?]

1268
01:22:34,450 --> 01:22:35,807
<i>No, this isn't it.</i>

1269
01:22:37,945 --> 01:22:39,856
If the hints aren't talking about people...

1270
01:22:41,504 --> 01:22:45,056
[Thinking since earlier that the hints
may not be alluding to real people.]

1271
01:22:45,056 --> 01:22:47,520
I think I'm starting to get something...
I'm starting to get an inkling.

1272
01:22:47,521 --> 01:22:48,672
Wait...

1273
01:22:49,684 --> 01:22:51,355
- What if...
- Yeah?

1274
01:22:51,356 --> 01:22:56,664
What if the names Kim Yeon Ah, Yoo Jin,
and Min Hyo Rin are names in dramas?

1275
01:22:58,402 --> 01:23:00,997
- What if they're characters in a dramas?
- Drama?

1276
01:23:00,998 --> 01:23:05,052
What if they're characters in either
a drama or a manga book?

1277
01:23:06,569 --> 01:23:08,804
- You think?
- Look up all three names then.

1278
01:23:09,750 --> 01:23:11,268
Then could it be Yong Hwa?

1279
01:23:11,269 --> 01:23:12,836
- We don't know that.
- Were they in a drama?

1280
01:23:12,837 --> 01:23:14,004
Yoo Jin...

1281
01:23:14,990 --> 01:23:18,554
- Look up all three.
- If not Yong Hwa, then Ji Hyo?

1282
01:23:19,131 --> 01:23:22,025
- Then it wouldn't be one of us.
- No, it wouldn't.

1283
01:23:22,026 --> 01:23:24,127
If it has to do with a drama,
then it wouldn't be one of us.

1284
01:23:24,128 --> 01:23:28,532
Let's just check this avenue out though.
It may not be someone real we're thinking of.

1285
01:23:29,434 --> 01:23:31,955
<i>Ki Kwang shouted out Min Hyo Rin
before he was taken away earlier.</i>

1286
01:23:31,956 --> 01:23:34,516
- He shouted out the name, Min Hyo Rin.
- But think about what was said earlier...

1287
01:23:34,792 --> 01:23:37,894
The PD said the one who chose the snake
would know that the clues meant them.

1288
01:23:37,895 --> 01:23:42,405
Then let's put it all together.
Min Hyo Rin, Yoo Jin, and Kim Yeon Ah...

1289
01:23:44,174 --> 01:23:45,704
I don't know.

1290
01:23:46,390 --> 01:23:49,432
- I don't even have the slightest clue.
- I can't think of anything either.

1291
01:23:52,293 --> 01:23:55,262
CN Blue's Jung Yong Hwa confesses that
his ideal woman is Kim Yeon Ah?

1292
01:23:55,263 --> 01:23:56,943
- That probably isn't it, right?
- No, I don't think that's it.

1293
01:23:58,826 --> 01:24:00,963
No matter how I think about it,
I don't have a clue either.

1294
01:24:02,419 --> 01:24:04,007
Do you have any idea?

1295
01:24:05,699 --> 01:24:09,205
[Oh? Wait...]

1296
01:24:10,011 --> 01:24:11,891
- I wonder of it's me?
- Why? Tell us why?

1297
01:24:11,892 --> 01:24:14,309
- Why? Tell us why?
