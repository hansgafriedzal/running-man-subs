Hello to all the viewers out there.
I'm your host for the day, Kim Hwan.

00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:32,570
With the arrival of the long awaited 2013,
we now start our opening ceremony for 2013.

[Picket... entrance?]

13
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:41,620
Wow... the wind...

14
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:43,500
It's so windy out here.

[Cutting through the icy wind
to enter the lobby.]

16
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:50,160
- Hello.
- It's so nice to see you.

17
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,000
- Thank you.
- Hello.

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,820
<i>I'm glad to see everyone with
a smile on your faces.</i>

19
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:59,490
[Happy to see Kim Hwan here as
Running Man's official announcer.]

20
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:01,020
What's going on here today?

21
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:04,980
<i>I see that you've all walked in with
your new year's resolutions for 2013.</i>

22
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:08,740
<i>[To slap Jong Kook on the face
more than twice this year.]</i>

23
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:11,790
<i>To hear Jong Kook plead for his life
more than twice this year...</i>

24
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:14,180
<i>and to eliminate Jong Kook's name tag
more than three times this year.</i>

25
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:16,910
[Every one of his resolution involves
besting his Tiger brother.]

26
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:17,940
Shall I read you mine?

27
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:23,420
<i>To hold Jong Kook down with my strength
and rip his name tag off with my left hand.</i>

28
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:27,920
Ten times... to do this at least ten times.

29
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:31,400
<i>I wrote down, Unification of the nation.</i>

30
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:33,440
[To put out a popular song.]

31
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:37,140
And... to announce my retirement.

32
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:39,150
Since I need to reaffirm my character...

33
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:41,300
And your last one is SBS' Grand Prize?

34
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:43,790
That is my humble dream.

35
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:45,880

Grand Prize award?]

38
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:55,170
I wrote down that I want to be the victor
more than five times this year.

39
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:58,850
And... I would like to bring back
the gold prizes for the races.

actress symbolic of purity, Uhm Ji Won.]

- Hello.
- Hello.

56
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:04,920
How is it that you're on our show?

57
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:10,980
- I'm a huge fan of yours!
- Let's see what Shin Yang's resolutions are.

58
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:13,810
- Wow, you have a great handwriting.
- Did you write that yourself?

59
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,960
<i>[To shoot a great movie.]</i>

60
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:19,270
Can you say it in your screen voice?

61
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:25,380
[In the voice that was used in 'The Promise'
which had become a topic of conversation.]

62
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:28,800
[This is the scene!]

63
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:37,670
[In the same tone as that time...]

64
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:40,590
<i>And to make a good movie...</i>

65
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,340
[Exactly in the same tone
which was used back then.]

66
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:52,100
<i>To ski better... and to love more.</i>

67
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:54,640
[A man who does everything
with a flare of elegance.]

68
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,630
[If nothing else, at least for today,
that image will surely come to a ruin!]

69

can't be seen anywhere else!]

[Next up is Thumbelina Ji Won's
new year's resolutions.]

71
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:06,000
<i>For the advertisements to succeed,
and for the marriage to succeed.</i>

72
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,560
- It sounds like you'll be successful.
- Thank you.

73
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:12,210
[An innocent image that she
once portrayed...]

74
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:15,660
[A revealing of her real image
coming to you soon!]

75
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:18,970
Next, we have a new year's greeting
from the General Manager.

76
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:21,600
[Could it really be the General Manager?]

77
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,870
Really? The General Manager?

78
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:26,200
- Really?
- Please welcome him with a round of applause.

79
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,280
- The General Manager is coming?
- Is he really?

80
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,240
- He really is coming!
- Oh my!

81
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:35,250
[The real General Manager
makes his appearance!]

82
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:38,890
- General Manager...
- Oh my... hello!

83
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:41,420
We're all dressed in sweat suits...

84
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:44,000
My name is Park Jung Hoon,
the program General Manager for SBS.

85
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,120
I've been to the award show a few times,
but coming on the program like this...

86
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,790
I feel a little bashful to be here.

87
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:54,220
Hello, I'm 2012's super model, Jung Ha Eun.

88
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:57,430
[A noticeably different welcome?]

89
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:03,400
Two and a half years have gone by
since Running Man first started airing.

90
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:07,720
You've all worked very hard for those years
running to bring laughter to our viewers.

91
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:11,450
I hope that you get the inspiration to
bring even bigger laughter in the new year.

92
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:12,550
Thank you.

93
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:19,090
Why don't you announce the teams
for today's race for us?

94
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:22,580
- General Manager will announce the teams.
- Team announcement?

95
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:25,730
He came to the opening ceremony to
announce today's teams.

96
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:27,830
I will announce today's teams.

97
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:29,430
The first team...

98
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:32,440
It's full of members that I like.

99
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:36,030
Song Ji Hyo... Ji Suk Jin and Yoo Jae Suk.

100
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:37,400
Me too?

101
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,390
Then does that mean you don't like us?

102
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:43,120
The second team...

103
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:44,910
Uhm Ji Won...

104
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:47,970
and Kim Jong Kook,
whom I respect very much.

105
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:49,660
Respect?

106
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:51,410
Lee Kwang Soo,
whom I love very much.

107
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,940
I'm full of respect and love for you!

108
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:56,020
I wish you nothing but
the best in the new year!

109
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:58,580
And lastly, our guest, Park Shin Yang...

110
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,010
Ha Ha and Gary will make up
our final team.

111
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:09,240
- This is great!
- But this is...

112
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,180
These guys lack too much to be
on the same team with Shin Yang.

113
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:15,950
- How can you say such a thing?
- They lack too much to be with Shin Yang.

114
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:17,900
I'm the one who's really close
to Shin Yang!

115
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,650
What do you mean, you two are close?

116
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:22,130
- Let's see about this in 10 years!
- What a joke!

117
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:27,310
In gratefulness for all your hard work thus far
and for your continued efforts in the future

118
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,950
- A bonus?
- Yes, the General Manager...

119
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:31,830
- Really?
- Yes, he's giving out a special bonus.

120
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:34,850
[Special Bonus!]

121
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:38,710
- Wow, that looks thick.
- Thank you very much.

122
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,990
[Closing out the opening ceremony
with warm hearts and greeting.]

123
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:44,790
- Really? 50,000 won bills?
- Can you just tell us the color of the bills?

124
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:47,570
It's real money in here.

125
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:49,020
What is this?

126
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,790
[Target General Manager's bonus cash!]

127
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:52,670
[Real battle of the money targeting
the bonus cash!]

128
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:54,900
[Each team is given
1,000,000 won in bonus cash!]

129
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:57,980
[But the team that comes in last at missions
will have to forfeit some of their cash!]

130
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:01,890
[Which team will protect their bonus to
the end to laugh their way to the bank?]

131
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:05,100
Finally, the money is within my grasp.

132
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:10,290
Anyway, everyone be aware to protect
your cash bonus to the end, okay?

133
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:13,400
Our two guests who took the time out
of their busy schedule to be here...

134
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,790
be sure to take good care of them.

135
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:17,530
I'm going to win the money,
and give it all to her.

136
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:18,680
- Really?
- Of course.

137
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,240
Without even asking me about it first?

138
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,810
Since they took the time to come on the show,
of course she should get the money.

139
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:25,160
- Seriously?
- Of course!

140
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,570
Geun Young was way too young for you!

141
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:30,080
When I told people that I was coming
on the show, I was told that I needed

142
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,960
to do whatever I could to get
Kim Jong Kook on my team.

143
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,990
There you two go pairing off now.

144
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:39,290
And I was told to do whatever I could
to stay away from Kwang Soo.

145
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:41,630
- What does that mean?
- I was told not to get close to him.

146
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:44,130
You can think of them as two opposites
ends of the extreme.

147
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:47,140
How about you, Shin Yang?
Have you been told who to team up with?

148
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:54,670
To be perfectly honest... these two weren't
amongst the recommendations.

149
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:57,920
Shin Yang... I won the race last week!

150
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,670
I don't betray anyone,
and I'm a very valuable member too!

151
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:03,940
Seriously, that's so disappointing to hear!

152
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:06,760
I won the most races last year!
[When?]

153
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,510
<i>Manager Gae, take good care of him.</i>

154
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:09,960
Yes, I will take very good care of him.

155
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,510
Manager Gae, take very good care of him.

156
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:14,340
And over here,
we have the Lady and her servants.

157
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:15,940
[Team Lady and servants?]

158
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,160
Lady and her servants.

159
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,040
As for us...

160
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:21,710
Our team is a family who's been together
for a very long time.

161
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:25,110
I think this is the first time
the three of you are on the same team.

162
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,890
[Bonus target race - Start!]

163
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:33,510
[Stepping out into the icy cold winds.]

164
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:35,120
- It's so cold.
- It's really cold out.

165
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:39,530
- Who has the money right now?
- It's in Kwang Soo's bag.

166
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:41,600
- You have the money?
- I do feel a little nervous about it...

167
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,420
I was told Kwang Soo can't be trusted
with such things.

168
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:46,570
- Give it to me.
- I'm really not like that!

169
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:54,110
[Ji Won takes the bonus to
keep it close to her.]

170
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:59,520
- This team up really sucks.
- That's what I'd like to say!

171
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,660
- I don't like our team.
- Seriously, Song Ji Hyo...

172
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:04,780
- You can call us babies.
- What did you say?

173
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:06,300
- You can call us babies.
- Babies?

174
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:08,300
Please say, 'Come on baby, let's go.'

175
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:13,590
- There's something I'm really curious about.
- Yes?

176
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:15,540
Why is your name Gary?

177
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:18,800
My nickname when I was
in middle school was Gae (Dog).

178
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:21,510
- Shin Yang!
- Yeah?

179
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:24,150
Why do you keep calling out his name?

180
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:27,490
[Off to their first mission location!]

181
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:33,620
But why is it... that I was told not to
choose you and Gary to be on my team?

182
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:35,290
I think they must be mistaken.

183
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:36,880
[Seems to like the little brothers
that he's been teamed up with?]

184
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:39,550
Keep it down when I'm talking.

185
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:42,320
[Scolds the navigation.]

186
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,240
[Quietly ordering the navigation around.]

187
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:52,310
- No more sounds, right?
- 'In a little bit...'

188
00:09:56,730 --> 00:10:00,990
[The gags are slowly getting started.]

189
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:08,030
I heard what you said to
Shin Yang earlier.

190
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:13,390
Yes. I decided that I wanted to become an
actress after I saw him in 'The Promise'.

191
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:15,120
[Her decision was made after seeing
Shin Yang's movie, 'The Promise'.]

192
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:20,240
- The movies that you were in...
- What have you seen?

193
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,400
I've seen every single one of them.
Just name it, and I've seen it.

194
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:25,370
- 'The Promise'...
- That was the beginning. 'The letter'...

195
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,540
Even though you wore the cap in the movie
because you played an ill patient...

196
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:33,220
But Gary is wearing his cap today
in honor of your role in that movie.

197
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:36,000
<i>With a touch of Hye Min's feel to it...</i>

198
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:39,380
'Why can't you say it?'

199
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:44,660
'That this is my man!
Why can't you say it?'

200
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:47,060
I'm asking you, why can't you say it?

201
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:48,720
Don't you love me?

202
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,720
When I'm your man!

203
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:54,230
[Even after the passing of all these years,
the scene is still clear in their minds.]

204
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:58,650
From now on, you can call us
Baby one, and Baby two.

205
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:01,070
- Let's go, babies.
- Gary...

206
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,420
Gary, let's go.

207
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:07,010
Ha Ha, let's go.

208
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:11,470
[Bonus target race -
Their first mission location is?]

209
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:14,460
- What are we going to do at a gas station?
- We've never been to a gas station before.

210
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:16,040
What are we going to do there?

211
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:19,060
What if we have to go through the
automatic car wash in there?

212
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:21,490
Jong Kook is like Running Man's
own fortune teller.

213
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:25,150
- I'm a fortune teller too.
- I know.

214
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:27,240
[Ji Won plays a shaman in her new movie.]

215
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:30,150
Then I'll see if I can guess.
At the gas station...

216
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:32,700
[I can see it... the vision...]

217
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:35,660
[I can see the mission...]

218
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:37,790
What is it?
What kind of a game will we be playing?

219
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,470
First, everyone will be gathered around.
After we're all gathered around...

220
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:45,450
[That kind of a prediction is something
anyone can guess...]

221
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:47,730
At the gas station...
there will be water involved.

222
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:50,860
[Water?]

223
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:52,640
We're going to be playing with water?
At the gas station?

224
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:55,070
[In... this harsh winter?]

225
00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:57,810
Since there's a self-car wash
at the gas station...

226
00:11:57,810 --> 00:11:59,250
I think we're going to be
playing around with that.

227
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:00,800
Self-car wash...

228
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:03,820
You seem to be pretty tired,
why don't you just get some rest?

229
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:05,800
Who's going to play around with
water in this cold weather?

230
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,470
I know. Not in this cold weather.
Today's the coldest we've had yet.

231
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:11,130
[A shaman?
Could Ji Won's predictions be right?]

232
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:15,400
<i>Let's go and check to see if our
Shaman's predictions are right.</i>

233
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:18,740
[Red Team arrives at the gas station.]

234
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:25,140
[What could be the mission that
awaits them at the gas station?]

235
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:29,140
- See? I was right!
- Where?

236
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:34,380
[Just as Ji Won predicted...
playing with the water?]

237
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:36,640
<i>- There's someone from 'The Matrix'.
- Who is that man?</i>

238
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:39,580
<i>Dong Hwan!
[You... you're...]</i>

239
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:42,730
[Are you from 'The Matrix'?]

240
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:44,570
What's with him?

241
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:49,250
- Go-Trix, please step forward.
- Go-Trix?

242
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:51,580
<i>The name of this game is,
'Gas station Matrix'.</i>

243
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:52,770
So what does that mean?

244
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:56,240
<i>I will show it to you,
so please step to your left for now.</i>

245
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,670
I wonder what it'll be about. Maybe
we'll have to put some water in there.

246
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:00,440
In that water container.

247
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,640
I'm getting an uneasy feeling about this.

248
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:06,130
What are they doing?
Ah... on our back? Like this?

249
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,130
[What is that?]

250
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,980
- What is that?
- What is he doing?

251
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:27,920
I think it's about gathering much water
as you can in the bowl.

252
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:32,350
- How are we supposed to do that?
- No way!

253
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:36,340
[Just like the scene in the movie.]

254
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:40,650
[The key point to this mission is
the flexibility of their backs!]

255
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:47,660
[The water has to reach the red line level
for it to be considered a success.]

256
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:51,730
I can't bend backwards like that.

257
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,320
That's too funny.

258
00:13:58,050 --> 00:14:01,230
- Shin Yang's face... is starting to harden.
- What is this?

259
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:05,570
[The smile on my face really isn't a smile.]

260
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:09,130
He came on the show because he didn't
realize what he was getting himself into.

261
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:12,720
This is just way too funny.

262
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,320
[This is what variety shows are
all about...]

263
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,800
<i>All of you are happy about receiving
your bonus cash today, right?</i>

264
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:23,240
<i>The team that comes in last
in this game has </i>

265
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,580
<i>to pay for other teams fuel fees
with the bonus cash that they received.</i>

266
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:28,140
[Rule: Loser team to pay for
other teams car fuel fees.]

267
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,970
[No wonder the fuel in the car
was so low...]

268
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:34,550
<i>The time you will be given
is 40 seconds.</i>

269
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,380
[Must fill past the red line with water
to succeed the mission.]

270
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:39,790
<i>It doesn't matter if you just
lie down on the ground either.</i>

271
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:43,380
[Aggressive Ji Won.]

272
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:46,770
Do you think we can catch a lot of water
if we lie down on the ground?

273
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:49,530
You guys should be doing that.
How can you make Ji Won do it?

274
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:55,040
[The two inconsiderate men leaving Ji Won
to be proactive all on her own.]

275
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,830
- She's lying down on the ground by herself!
- We're still thinking up a plan.

276
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,590
- Ji Won, why don't you lie down?
- Come on, hurry up!

277
00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:04,310
[Lying back down with a bright smile
on her face.]

278
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:06,390
And behind us, Shin Yang is
waiting for his ski lift.

279
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,330
[Where did he find the goggles?]

280
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:12,080
[I'm not going to go down that easily!]

281
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:14,710
[Red Team - Start!]

282
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:24,550
Stay still! Just stay still!

283
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:28,030
[Giraffe and the Tiger dumping
all the water on Ji Won.]

284
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:33,650
[What will be the result of their plan?]

285
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:40,730
Ji Won is...

286
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:44,350
[Ji Won's face getting completely soaked.]

287
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,030
- Help me get up!
- Hang on!

288
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:53,520
[In order not to waste even a
single drop of water...]

289
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:56,030
[A perfect matrix position.]

290
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:04,380
[Oh no! All the hard-earned water...]

291
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:05,810
What are you guys doing?

292
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:09,040
Help me get up!

293
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:13,480
[There's no time!
Gathering up the water in his mouth...]

294
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,480
We got it!

295
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:22,060
[Such precious water...]

296
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:25,030
[Oh no... you spilled so much of it!]

297
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:28,130
[Time over!]

298
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,240
[Fail...]

299
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:36,390
- How did I spill all that?
- You should've helped her up, Jong Kook.

300
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:37,850
[Ji Won's hard efforts going to waste...]

301
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:38,930
I'm completely soaked!

302
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:42,710
I'm soaked!

303
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:47,380
- Okay, challenge.
- Challenge!

304
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:49,880
We came up with a plan of our own.

305
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:50,990
[What is the plan that they
came up with?]

306
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,830
[A human stretcher?]

307
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:03,500
[Just what are they planning
by doing this?]

308
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,500
- Okay, let's do it!
- We're ready.

309
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:08,320
[Blue Team - Start!]

310
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:12,580
[Shots of water being shot out
once again!]

311
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:20,190
- Why is the water...
- Why is the water being sprayed?

312
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,310
Why is the water being sprayed?
Go Dong Hwan!

313
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:30,350
- You!
- Are you really going to be like this?

314
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:32,010
That's not right!
Let's go dump what we have.

315
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:38,760
[Thought they were just getting soaked...
but gathered up a nice bit of water!]

316
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:41,730
- Shoot the water!
- Go-Trix!

317
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:45,510
[Should I make it harder?]

318
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:00,160
[Their protesting is no match
for the forceful stream of water.]

319
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,330
[Impossible to even approach.]

320
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:05,820
- Hey! Go Dong Hwan!
- Go Dong Hwan!

321
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:08,100
[A fervent outcry directed at
Agent Go-Trix.]

322
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,070
[Time over!]

323
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:14,790
- Why are you giving us the water like that?
- Why are you giving it to us like that?

324
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:15,960
What are you doing?

325
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:19,310
[Their plan fails due to water being shot
at the differently than they had predicted.]

326
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:21,120
Do you even know how
heavy Ji Hyo is?

327
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:23,260
Don't be like that.

328
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:28,620
- His goggles...
- Why are you wearing the goggles?

329
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:31,070
[The goggles finally make their appearance.]

330
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:36,900
[Perfectly armed.]

331
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:40,880
[Team babies' turn at the challenge.]

332
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,440
[Raincoat brothers with a matching
cringe on their faces.]

333
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,440
More! Give us more water!

334
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,470
That's not enough water!

335
00:18:56,530 --> 00:18:59,470
[Did he come to earth from out of space
from lack of water at his home planet?]

336
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:03,740
[Armed with his goggles...
Shin Yang doesn't hesitate.]

337
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:06,470
[Give me my water!]

338
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:09,420
[Ah... there's the disadvantage of
not being able to see very well...]

339
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,720
[A new plan, Human pedestal.]

340
00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:26,400
[Armed with the goggles...
Shin Yang gathers the water and dumps it.]

341
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:30,410
[Is their plan working?]

342
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:32,560
[But the water stream has
a mind of its own...]

343
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,520
Give us the water the right way!

344
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,820
<i>Give us the water the right way!</i>

345
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:39,460
What are you doing?

346
00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:41,730
<i>You scoundrel!</i>

347
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:44,750
[The ever gentle Park Shin Yang
explodes during his first mission!]

348
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,250
Give us some water!

349
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:49,330
What are you doing?

350
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:51,090
What is this? A water spray?

351
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:56,020
[As if they've been waiting for it,
getting right up in front of the water.]

352
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:58,570
[I'll give you as much as you want...]

353
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:01,670
- I can't see... I can't see!
- Over here!

354
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:05,230
[His vision is blocked
because of his goggles...]

355
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:09,380
[Time over!]

356
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:11,720
[Fail]

357
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:15,380
<i>He can't even see in front of him
because of his goggles.</i>

358
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:17,870
[Blue Team's challenge]

359
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:21,260
[Their plan is to form
a single line this time?]

360
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:23,330
<i>Set... go!</i>

361
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:28,090
[Taking turns to move
quickly through the line!]

362
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,720
Where do you think you're
shooting that thing?

363
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:44,600
[Definitely an unpredictable
water stream.]

364
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:45,720
Hey! Watch where you shoot
that thing!

365
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:50,160
[Is he gargling?]

366
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:55,840
<i>You've got 10 seconds left!</i>

367
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,250
[10 seconds to go!]

368
00:20:58,230 --> 00:21:01,550
[Give me my water...]

369
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:06,300
[Their last spurt of attempt.]

370
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:08,830
[Just concentrating on their bucket
without even being able to open their eyes.]

371
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,210
<i>Stop!</i>

372
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:11,500
[Time over]

373
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:14,570
[Almost to the line... did they succeed?]

374
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:15,710
[Ah... just shy of the line!]

375
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:19,930
[Will Blank Ji fill the rest?]

376
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:28,990
What the heck!

377
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:32,920
[All that water in the end!]

378
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:38,230
[Blue Team succeeds!]

379
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,220
[Crap...]

380
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,760
- How did you do that?
- I couldn't see, so I just did what I could.

381
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:47,880
- How did you do that?
- How did you catch so much water?

382
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:50,370
- I can't believe this!
- How did you catch all that water?

383
00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:52,680
[Running Man's Ace
showing off her true skills.]

384
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:57,420
[Blue Team passes as first place winners.
Free gas for their car!]

385
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:00,240
It's okay.
We just need to come in second.

386
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,450
- We just can't come in last.
- As long as we're not last, we're okay.

387
00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:03,770
- Fighting!
- Fighting!

388
00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:05,210
[Red Team's challenge.]

389
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:07,330
<i>Set... go!</i>

390
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16,690
[What could it be this time?]

391
00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:22,860
[His position ensuring that
he'll get soaked to the bone.]

392
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:24,820
[If anything, he's only getting in the
way of his own teammates.]

393
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:28,660
[Gathering more water in his mouth
than in the bowl itself.]

394
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:36,160
[Giraffe is too stubborn to think about
changing the position he's taken.]

395
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,470
[On top of it all,
he's spilled everything he's got.]

396
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,050
[Ji Won working hard to pick up Giraffe's
slack to gather as much water as she can.]

397
00:22:59,330 --> 00:23:02,760
[It seems he's gathered quite a bit,
but he spills quite a bit too.]

398
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,500
[Time over!]

399
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:07,930
Are you a water beetle or something?

400
00:23:08,670 --> 00:23:10,880
[Ah... too bad...]

401
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:14,460
[Unbelievably disappointing... fail.]

402
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:19,640
Did you see Kwang Soo?
He only filled it up once.

403
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:22,590
I know! He only got in the way,
and didn't even help out!

404
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:24,550
You have to go and dump the
water immediately!

405
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,140
Being on the same team with
you is awful!

406
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:29,230
Come on, Ji Won... we just started!

407
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:32,900
- We just started.
- My manager told me to stay away from you.

408
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:37,540
- Team Baby, fighting!
- Fighting!

409
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:39,490
Be better about giving us
water this time.

410
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:42,590
<i>Set... go!</i>

411
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:51,920
[Shin Yang showing no hesitation.]

412
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:56,620
Is he not able to get up?

413
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,450
[Every drop is precious.]

414
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,160
[Green Team filling up
the water pitcher drop by drop.]

415
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:09,900
<i>You've got 10 seconds left!</i>

416
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:10,920
[10 seconds left to go!]

417
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:13,900
[The last burst of attempt.]

418
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:18,490
[Ever so carefully...]

419
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:21,380
[Pouring it in carefully.]

420
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:24,640
[Will it go over the line?]

421
00:24:28,930 --> 00:24:31,030
[Success.]

422
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:35,340
If you had been a little quicker,
we could've won!

423
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:36,400
[Blaming the Giraffe.]

424
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:46,550
I never should've even met you.

425
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:52,730
<i>With the Team Baby coming in second,
the Red Team will pay for everyone's gas.</i>

426
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:54,690
[Red Team to pay for everyone's gas.]

427
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,520
- How much is it?
- What?

428
00:24:57,530 --> 00:24:59,560
- How much?
- What do you mean? I'm filling it up.

429
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:03,460
- Since the gas is expensive, just a little...
- No, I have to fill it up!

430
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:05,770
- You can stop pumping now.
- What are you talking about?

431
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:07,830
- You can stop the pump.
- Fill it up, please.

432
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:08,920
Stop the pump.

433
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:13,530
[Blue Team wanting to fill up vs.
Red Team wanting the pump to stop.]

434
00:25:14,730 --> 00:25:18,600
[The gas is currently scraping
the bottom of the fuel tank.]

435
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,920
Excuse me... I'm going to fill it up.

436
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:24,250
We'll take 150,000 won worth of gas.

437
00:25:26,570 --> 00:25:28,030
- How about just 50,000 won worth?
- No, we have to fill it up.

438
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:29,440
50,000 would get you plenty
to drive around for the day.

439
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,540
Why are you being wasteful?

440
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:33,040
Why!? Why are you being wasteful?

441
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:36,540
I can't understand this!
Why are you being wasteful? Why?

442
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:39,860
50,000 will be plenty for the day,
so why are you being so wasteful?

443
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,570
Just put 50,000 won worth!

444
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:44,830
- There's the next game to consider!
- If anything, 50,000 is still too much!

445
00:25:46,450 --> 00:25:47,880
Be quiet!

446
00:25:47,890 --> 00:25:49,320
Just sit there and wait!

447
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:52,190
[Shin Yang is the one who beeped.]

448
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,870
[Immediately becomes docile.]

449
00:25:56,970 --> 00:25:58,540
[You're the best!]

450
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:01,030
Okay then,
I'll just put in 60,000 won worth.

451
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:04,290
- I'll just put in 50,000 won worth.
- No, put in just 50,000 won worth.

452
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:05,330
[Blue Team's 60,000 won vs.
Red Team's 50,000 won.]

453
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:08,900
- Why are they being wasteful?
- Can you talk some sense into them?

454
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:11,080
50,000 won is a lot of money.
You can get to Busan with 50,000 won!

455
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:15,340
[When are you ever going to gas up?]

456
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:17,280
Ugh... seriously!

457
00:26:17,290 --> 00:26:21,200
Come on... let's just settle on 50,000 won.
You can get to Busan on 50,000 won!

458
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:25,110
I'm not settling.
Just fill up 60,000 won worth.

459
00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:27,380
[Finally settles on 60,000 won.]

460
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:30,630
- We'll see how you do at the next game.
- 60,000 won isn't even a lot of gas!

461
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:34,270
We should be filling it up!

462
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:38,670
- Seriously, you people...
- Fill it up, please!

463
00:26:38,670 --> 00:26:41,600
As requested, we'll fill up your tank.

464
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,050
- Wait!
- Fill it up!

465
00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:47,060
[Red Team rushing over in a hurry.]

466
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:49,110
- Wait... hang on a minute.
- Suk Jin!

467
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:52,110
[Red Team is now starting to
deal with the Green Team.]

468
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:53,890
We don't need to be frivolous here.

469
00:26:53,890 --> 00:26:57,500
With 50,000 won worth of gas, we
can drive around all day for our games.

470
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:00,170
Why do we have to be so wasteful?

471
00:27:00,170 --> 00:27:02,730
- There's no need to do that.
- Why don't' you make the call, Shin Yang?

472
00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:05,420
[Green Team leaving their decision
making up to Shin Yang.]

473
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:07,010
Please fill it up with diesel gas.

474
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:10,130
[Fill up the car with diesel gas?]

475
00:27:10,990 --> 00:27:16,270
Shin Yang, even with 50,000 won worth,
you can get all the way down to Busan.

476
00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:19,620
We're going to leave all our
decision making up to Shin Yang.

477
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:22,210
Why don't you discuss it with Shin Yang?
You can discuss it with him though, right?

478
00:27:22,210 --> 00:27:24,340
You can't trust him on a
deal like this.

479
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:28,000
What are you talking about,
Monk Gae?

480
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:31,400
Okay, okay...
we'll just take 60,000 won worth.

481
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,390
- Thank you, Shin Yang.
- Okay, 60,000 won.

482
00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:40,310
- Yes, 60,000 won worth of gas!
- The fancy kind, please!

483
00:27:45,410 --> 00:27:47,860
[Red Team pays out
120,000 won in gas costs.]

484
00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:49,940
We're supposed to go to
the health club in Shilwaldong.

485
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:53,130
- That's something Jong Kook would like.
- You're right, it is.

486
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,910
- Have a great day!
- Bye, and thank you!

487
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,060
Okay, let's get on our way.

488
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:02,890
<i>Our next location...
Ji Won, please read it out loud.</i>

489
00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:09,100
<i>Go to the health club in Shilwaldong,
and find the Running Man landmark.</i>

490
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:10,470
<i>- A health club?
- Yes.</i>

491
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:12,530
- The health club in Shilwaldong.
- A health club...

492
00:28:12,530 --> 00:28:14,520
It's the same thing as
going home for Jong Kook.

493
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:17,680
You didn't swallow too much water
back there, did you?

494
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:20,750
You were on your back too much and
you had so much water dumped on you.

495
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:22,230
Did you not see me
lying down on my back?

496
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:25,010
Even though you did,
you weren't of much help to us.

497
00:28:25,010 --> 00:28:28,260
- Yeah! You should've moved quicker!
- If you had done better, we could've...

498
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:30,250
Of course, don't you think?

499
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:34,100
[Ji Won and Kkuk joining together
to scold Giraffe.]

500
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:36,500
When it was just us two doing it,
we almost had it to the line, didn't we?

501
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:41,050
We could've won for sure if you'd just
made at least two trips to the pitcher.

502
00:28:41,050 --> 00:28:43,990
We could've been in first place.
You just looked like a water beetle.

503
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:49,600
- I promise to do better at the next game.
- We're in the last place because of you.

504
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:53,410
- Just watch... I'll do it this time around.
- What? You're going to win this game for us?

505
00:28:53,410 --> 00:28:56,870
- You guys are siding against me, aren't you?
- No, it's not like that.

506
00:28:56,870 --> 00:29:00,320
[Are we detecting a love line?]

507
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,460
We're just banding together
because we're on the same team.

508
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:04,650
- Team work... it's called team work.
- No, this is more like a love line.

509
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:07,470
- It's team work.
- You're not denying that it isn't either.

510
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:13,380
- The way you guys are banding together...
- It's not that. But this is about winning.

511
00:29:15,530 --> 00:29:19,430
Your goggles were a nice touch.
You were very prepared today, Shin Yang.

512
00:29:19,430 --> 00:29:21,850
Yes, I always keep them in my car.

513
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:26,660
I can see how competitive you are now.

514
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:28,430
Our... that's...

515
00:29:30,210 --> 00:29:33,110
[Sharing his emergency stash of
chocolates with his little brothers.]

516
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:34,650
This will give us more energy.

517
00:29:35,810 --> 00:29:36,890
Shin Yang...

518
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:44,810
[Is this... the love line that had
hoped for in the new year?]

519
00:29:44,810 --> 00:29:46,740
What are you guys doing?

520
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:54,560
My wish this year was to...
make five love lines this year.

521
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,120
You're my first for the year.

522
00:29:57,230 --> 00:29:58,730
Can we not do that?

523
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:02,850
Are we a love triangle then?

524
00:30:05,390 --> 00:30:07,330
[Arrives at the second mission location.]

525
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,380
[Shinwaldong's fitness center.]

526
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:15,820
Kim Jong Kook... he's going to love this.
This might as well be Jong Kook's home.

527
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:20,210
[Huh? A microphone on the
weight machines?]

528
00:30:20,210 --> 00:30:22,880
<i>- Look at this... this is karaoke.
- Look at the microphones.</i>

529
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,990
<i>Ah, that karaoke room?</i>

530
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:27,420
Try this. Can you even do this?

531
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:31,710
- I hate games like these.
- Games likes these aren't good for us.

532
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:42,620
What do you mean, 'wow'?
Kim Jong Kook's on that every single day!

533
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:47,370
- This game is meant for Kim Jong Kook.
- What kind of a game is this?

534
00:30:48,370 --> 00:30:51,110
<i>If you can get over 90 points by singing into
the mikes attached on the machines...</i>

535
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:52,890
Isn't this my house?

536
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,000
This is my house.

537
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,330
- Stop being so happy.
- I feel like I'm home.

538
00:30:57,330 --> 00:31:00,120
<i>Lunch rides on the winning of this game...</i>

539
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:03,410
[The loser team from this game will have
to pay for everyone's lunch bill.]

540
00:31:03,410 --> 00:31:06,750
- We have to pick really good dishes.
- Are there any good mushroom dishes?

541
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:08,830
How about the sea urchin soup?
That sounds god, the sea urchin.

542
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:11,410
- How about the sea urchin soup?
- We should definitely have sea urchin soup.

543
00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:13,480
- Shin Yang, what are you going to eat?
- I'm going to have the sea urchin soup.

544
00:31:14,670 --> 00:31:16,920
[Fitting right in.]

545
00:31:16,930 --> 00:31:20,540
- Do you like sea urchin soup?
- Do you even know what that is?

546
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:22,600
Yes, I eat this soup every day.

547
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:26,460
[Sly as a fox, Shin Yang.]

548
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:30,190
Sea urchin soup is baby's
favorite thing!

549
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:32,620
- What are you going to eat, Ji Won?
- I'm going to have the sea urchin soup.

550
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:36,740
[Sea urchin soup seems to be
the most popular item on the menu...]

551
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:39,390
<i>- The staff will be joining in on the meal.
- What?</i>

552
00:31:39,390 --> 00:31:42,390
[On top of that, there will be an added
100 staff members joining their lunch!]

553
00:31:42,390 --> 00:31:45,010
- What did you say?
- We have to pay for all theirs too?

554
00:31:45,010 --> 00:31:47,260
The loser team has to pay for everything?

555
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:48,860
<i>I told you earlier that you'd have to
pay for the lunch bill.</i>

556
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:51,350
Okay! It's not going to
be us anyway.

557
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:55,260
[As long as they don't come in last...]

558
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:57,330
- As long as we're not last, right?
- Fine, we can do this!

559
00:31:57,330 --> 00:31:59,070
<i>It's not going to be us!</i>

560
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:03,820
[Staff members lining up to
put in their lunch order.]

561
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:07,060
[Staff members ordering what they want
without any care to what the dish costs.]

562
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:09,270
Get whatever you want!

563
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:10,340
Order whatever you'd like to order.

564
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:13,220
[With the confidence that he
won't be the one to come in last...]

565
00:32:16,330 --> 00:32:17,990
I'm feeling uneasy about this.

566
00:32:19,810 --> 00:32:23,760
[If we lose this...
my entire bonus goes out the window.]

567
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,550
<i>Thank you for the meal!</i>

568
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:37,450
[Whomever comes in last is about to
lose all their money in one shot.]

569
00:32:43,290 --> 00:32:45,270
[Blue Team's challenge.]

570
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:48,340
- We're going to sing, 'In the bus'.
- This is the best song for this.

571
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:51,950
Let's not waste our energy
and wait for the song to start.

572
00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:54,340
[Blue Team confident of their
singing skills.]

573
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:55,340
There's the beat.

574
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:59,290
[Dancing spirit starting to seep out.]

575
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:07,440
[Trying to lure Shin Yang into
join in on his dancing?]

576
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:27,990
[Shin Yang joining in on their dancing.]

577
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:33,400
[Baby Team falling in sync
with their dancing.]

578
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:43,040
[Not strong enough?]

579
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:49,020
[Big-nosed Brother singing
through his stomach.]

580
00:34:01,730 --> 00:34:04,060
[Breathing becoming impossible.]

581
00:34:16,470 --> 00:34:18,710
[Ji Hyo is the only one
not missing a beat.]

582
00:34:23,390 --> 00:34:25,330
[What are you doing?]

583
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:32,820
Suk Jin really isn't doing a thing.

584
00:34:36,650 --> 00:34:40,120
[46 points.]

585
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:43,570
Suk Jin, what are you doing?
Seriously!

586
00:34:43,570 --> 00:34:45,310
Suk Jin contributed six of those points.

587
00:34:46,570 --> 00:34:48,180
<i>Our team got here first.</i>

588
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:52,830
[The food they ordered!]

589
00:34:55,380 --> 00:34:57,240
The food's already here?

590
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:00,360
[Being welcomed with a
round of applause.]

591
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,900
Enjoy! Enjoy your lunch!

592
00:35:03,910 --> 00:35:05,890
<i>Everyone, enjoy your lunch!</i>

593
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,230
Look at Gwan Yeol...

594
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:15,320
He looks happier than
he did at his own wedding.

595
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:18,270
[Can't hear you.]

596
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:23,730
[A feast fit for a king.]

597
00:35:25,230 --> 00:35:27,810
- We've got the total for the lunch bill.
- How much is it?

598
00:35:27,810 --> 00:35:30,780
<i>The total amount for all of you,
and the staff members is...</i>

599
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:36,170
<i>The total amount is...
930,000 won.</i>

600
00:35:36,170 --> 00:35:37,480
[A total of 930,000 won!]

601
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:45,320
[The loser team is about to
go bankrupt...]

602
00:35:45,850 --> 00:35:47,170
[All we have to do is eat...]

603
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:52,970
Maybe we need to thinking of something else.
I don't think we have enough money.

604
00:35:52,970 --> 00:35:54,380
[Full of worries.]

605
00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:58,480
- The Green Team will now take the challenge!
- Challenge!

606
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,590
Fighting!

607
00:36:01,590 --> 00:36:02,950
[Their song of choice is 'Let's get away'.]

608
00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:05,240
I'm not completely down yet!

609
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:17,800
[Whatever...
They're solely focused on their food.]

610
00:36:26,210 --> 00:36:29,100
[Singing upside down!]

611
00:36:30,650 --> 00:36:33,010
[His blood is flowing more and more...]

612
00:36:54,090 --> 00:36:55,630
[Not even budging.]

613
00:37:07,990 --> 00:37:09,350
[Exhaustion hits.]

614
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:14,770
[Showing off his extreme flexibility.]

615
00:37:17,430 --> 00:37:20,000
[Even his voice is loud and clear.]

616
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:23,890
[Ro-Ro changing his machine.]

617
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:32,360
He's not pulling it taut enough!

618
00:37:33,550 --> 00:37:35,870
[Perfect size for me.]

619
00:37:37,530 --> 00:37:39,880
- This is simple.
- It's because you're so short!

620
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:44,720
[Screaming at the top of his lungs.]

621
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:52,310
[This one is on the verge of
his deathbed.]

622
00:37:53,790 --> 00:37:55,980
[End of the song.]

623
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:01,060
Can you pull this up?
Please pull this up.

624
00:38:02,090 --> 00:38:04,870
[Too bad... but a fail, nonetheless.]

625
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:08,380
[Shin Yang having shown off
how flexible he could be.]

626
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:10,050
Can you stretch down completely
this way?

627
00:38:10,050 --> 00:38:11,830
Why are you asking me to do
such weird things?

628
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:15,240
- I was just asking.
- You really surprised me with that.

629
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:17,550
- Can you show us?
- I doubt I can do it.

630
00:38:17,550 --> 00:38:19,440
- Just in case, can you show us?
- He says he can't do it.

631
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,470
Why do you keep asking him to do it
when he says he can't do it!

632
00:38:21,470 --> 00:38:25,060
- Shin Yang says he can't do it!
- I'm trying to weed him out!

633
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:31,870
- Why aren't you working harder?
- You saw him pull up the weight!

634
00:38:32,530 --> 00:38:35,720
He was just about to do it!

635
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:37,840
Then why don't you give it a try?

636
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:40,600
No thanks to you,
we all have to do it now!

637
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:42,940
This is a good thing!
We can see what his downfalls are!

638
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:51,020
What about the two losing teams
give the winning team 10,000 each?

639
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:57,450
- Should we do it?
- Don't do it. He used to do gymnastics.

640
00:38:57,450 --> 00:38:59,740
- What?
- He used to do gymnastics!

641
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:01,640
Shin Yang used to be in gymnastics?

642
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:03,530
Why didn't you tell us that earlier?

643
00:39:03,530 --> 00:39:06,280
- Why didn't you tell us!
- Does he have to tell you everything?

644
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:09,390
In that case...

645
00:39:09,730 --> 00:39:14,020
[With 10,000 on the line, each team
chooses one person to do the splits.]

646
00:39:14,630 --> 00:39:17,240
We have no one else on our team
other than Ji Hyo.

647
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:19,010
- Both of us are too stiff.
- Let's do this quickly.

648
00:39:19,530 --> 00:39:22,400
- I think someone may need to hold her.
- Should we hold your hands?

649
00:39:31,270 --> 00:39:34,190
[A desperate cry to win 10,000.]

650
00:39:36,650 --> 00:39:39,090
[Giving it her best shot while
screaming out 10,000 won.]

651
00:39:41,150 --> 00:39:43,260
This was our best shot.

652
00:39:43,270 --> 00:39:45,620
Ji Hyo, you did good.
You're more flexible than I thought.

653
00:39:45,630 --> 00:39:47,390
- You have to hold on to me.
- 10,000 won is hanging on this.

654
00:39:58,430 --> 00:40:00,540
[Amazing flexibility!]

655
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:03,300
- What in the world was that?
- Why did you keep quiet about that?

656
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:05,230
Her hand was shaking so bad
while she was doing that.

657
00:40:07,830 --> 00:40:10,580
[This is all... power of 10,000 won?]

658
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:12,870
- Pull your pants down... pull them down.
- Why?

659
00:40:12,870 --> 00:40:15,080
You have to pull your pants down
so that you can get down really low.

660
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:16,710
You have to pull your pants
down, Shin Yang.

661
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,100
You know hip-hop style, don't you?

662
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:26,730
- You have to pull them down this much.
- Why are you following them and doing that?

663
00:40:27,610 --> 00:40:29,980
[Doing everything that he's
ordered to do.]

664
00:40:32,570 --> 00:40:35,070
[10,000 won is riding on this bet...]

665
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:38,590
Look at Gwan Yeol eating while
he watches the show we're putting on.

666
00:40:38,590 --> 00:40:40,130
Park Shin Yang, fighting!

667
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:52,320
He touching the ground!
He's down all the way and touching!

668
00:40:53,470 --> 00:40:55,200
[Wow! He really is touching the ground!]

669
00:40:57,740 --> 00:40:59,830
Shin Yang, wait... are you okay?

670
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:03,150
Are you okay?

671
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:05,280
You really are something else.

672
00:41:06,910 --> 00:41:09,360
[Green Team wins 20,000 won!]

673
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:12,040
What the heck is this?
It's all Suk Jin's fault.

674
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:13,790
Pay up first.

675
00:41:13,790 --> 00:41:15,890
- We'll give it to you later.
- We'll give it to you in a little bit.

676
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:18,390
- Give it to us now.
- Hey!

677
00:41:18,390 --> 00:41:20,700
We want to get paid while
the cameras are rolling.

678
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:23,210
- Later! Let's do it later!
- No, give it to us now.

679
00:41:23,210 --> 00:41:25,470
- Just do it later!
- Come on, give it to us now.

680
00:41:27,290 --> 00:41:29,410
- Give me my money. My money!
- Hey!

681
00:41:29,410 --> 00:41:32,540
<i>- Give me my money. My money!
- Hey!</i>

682
00:41:33,070 --> 00:41:36,230
[Screams erupting without even
realizing it herself.]

683
00:41:40,330 --> 00:41:41,850
[Was my scream too loud?]

684
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:46,160
- You did good! Okay, it's back on.
- Here's your money!

685
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:49,390
- Where's Red Team's money?
- Ji Won went to get it.

686
00:41:49,390 --> 00:41:51,730
I have to give them the money? Now?

687
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:56,460
10,000 won! 10,000 won!

688
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:57,890
I'm coming!

689
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:02,190
- Give it to me! Give it to me!
- Be quiet!

690
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:04,250
Here!

691
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:07,440
[A lady with a boisterous scream.]

692
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:13,630
Remember when you had to beg your mom
to buy you something when you were little?

693
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:16,010
I felt like that's what I was seeing.

694
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:18,680
<i>There's a sassy attractiveness
about that.</i>

695
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:20,950
Are you giving out
any extra points for dancing?

696
00:42:20,950 --> 00:42:24,340
If there are extra points for that...
we'll sing 'Run to you'.

697
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:26,150
<i>We can dance a little.</i>

698
00:42:26,150 --> 00:42:27,990
I can't dance.

699
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,960
Let's see Ji Won's dance moves!

700
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:33,070
- Here it comes.
- Ji Won, you look cute.

701
00:42:33,070 --> 00:42:35,780
[Huh? The song's starting even before
they can get into position?]

702
00:42:41,870 --> 00:42:43,650
[Aren't you going to sing?]

703
00:42:43,650 --> 00:42:45,160
<i>You have to sing too!</i>

704
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:49,660
[Chaotic dancing]

705
00:42:55,330 --> 00:42:57,250
[They're going to sing together?]

706
00:43:10,470 --> 00:43:13,560
[Is Giraffe going for his new year's
resolution in this situation?]

707
00:43:20,660 --> 00:43:21,790
My foot!

708
00:43:22,750 --> 00:43:24,600
[As a final move,
snapping the band in his face?]

709
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:33,480
[Giraffe and the Tiger's chaotic duet.]

710
00:43:38,490 --> 00:43:40,220
[Once again... step!]

711
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:43,580
[Whenever the opportunity arises,
his betrayal DNA comes to life.]

712
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:52,100
[The Tiger's counterattack.]

713
00:43:57,810 --> 00:44:00,960
[The Giraffe and the Tiger tossing
and turning in their scuffle.]

714
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:03,490
[Somehow remembering to dance
in the midst of their situation.]

715
00:44:04,530 --> 00:44:06,790
[The song finally comes to an end...]

716
00:44:10,990 --> 00:44:13,730
[To make matters worse, they
receive the worst score thus far.]

717
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:16,320
- 36 points.
- Sorry.

718
00:44:17,110 --> 00:44:18,720
We're going to sing the song...

719
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:25,130
that made so many women's hearts flutter
from 'Lovers in Paris' a few years ago.

720
00:44:25,810 --> 00:44:29,500
[The song, 'Is it okay to love you?']

721
00:44:29,510 --> 00:44:31,010
We're going to sing,
'Is it okay to love you'.

722
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:32,190
That's too high for me.

723
00:44:32,190 --> 00:44:34,530
Yes. He would like for you to
come down a couple octaves.

724
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:39,710
Park Shin Yang's 'Glass Box'...
No, not that...

725
00:44:39,710 --> 00:44:42,810
Park Shin Yang's
'Is it okay to love you'.

726
00:44:42,810 --> 00:44:45,200
'Is it okay to love you'
by Park Shin Yang.

727
00:44:48,250 --> 00:44:50,920
[In truth, he's about
to start singing his own song.]

728
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:53,890
Shin Yang just realized that
there's 90,000 won on the line here.

729
00:44:53,890 --> 00:44:56,700
- So that's why he's singing his own song.
- Come on, baby!

730
00:44:59,290 --> 00:45:02,440
[Yes... that's the song!]

731
00:45:04,140 --> 00:45:07,780
[The scene that made so many
women's hearts flutter.]

732
00:45:09,010 --> 00:45:12,850
[The sweet and melodious,
'Is it okay to love you'.]

733
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:26,070
[The song has a different feel to it
depending on who's singing it.]

734
00:45:34,620 --> 00:45:39,910
[Singing the song again for
the first time in 10 years.]

735
00:45:39,910 --> 00:45:43,720
[The same gentle voice...]

736
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:50,330
- I'm just going to soak it in.
- Keep it down a bit.

737
00:45:54,010 --> 00:45:55,990
<i>I love listening to Shin Yang
singing it!</i>

738
00:45:56,640 --> 00:46:00,250
[Everyone just sitting back
to listen to the song.]

739
00:46:03,860 --> 00:46:06,160
[Is it the children's turn?]

740
00:46:15,580 --> 00:46:18,570
[The sweet song taking on a
different tone...]

741
00:46:26,630 --> 00:46:29,430
[Is the record skipping?]

742
00:46:30,810 --> 00:46:34,430
[The whole family breaking down
in laughter from the dissonance.]

743
00:46:50,410 --> 00:46:54,240
[Just as touching as it was back then...]

744
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:57,070
[Singing just as sweetly today...]

745
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:01,920
Let's take a little break.

746
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:06,430
[The highlight was rapper Gary's remix?]

747
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:18,920
<i>Park Shin Yang!
Park Shin Yang!</i>

748
00:47:24,860 --> 00:47:26,500
Shin Yang was awesome!

749
00:47:35,010 --> 00:47:37,550
Park Shin Yang's 'Is it okay to love you'
sung by Park Shin Yang himself. 50 points.

750
00:47:38,570 --> 00:47:40,270
<i>We're going to take another try.</i>

751
00:47:40,270 --> 00:47:41,980
[Red Team's challenge.]

752
00:47:47,450 --> 00:47:49,190
[Shaking like a leaf.]

753
00:47:53,180 --> 00:47:56,310
[On the other hand,
these two are singing with ease.]

754
00:47:59,870 --> 00:48:02,300
[Already at his limits?]

755
00:48:18,780 --> 00:48:21,730
[The weights starting to go down
inch by inch.]

756
00:48:26,950 --> 00:48:28,550
[Shouting it out loud.]

757
00:48:42,590 --> 00:48:45,710
[The nose getting further and
further away.]

758
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:49,300
[Come on down.]

759
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:53,530
[Save a giraffe!]

760
00:49:03,690 --> 00:49:05,990
[Comfortable?]

761
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:12,640
<i>Wow... look at Jong Kook.</i>

762
00:49:17,850 --> 00:49:19,390
Move... move.

763
00:49:20,860 --> 00:49:22,930
[Taking the equipment away from him?]

764
00:49:30,220 --> 00:49:32,610
[Ji Won singing consistently
without missing a beat.]

765
00:49:34,830 --> 00:49:37,670
[Did he finally find his resting spot?]

766
00:49:43,790 --> 00:49:46,050
[Now that he feels like he can breathe,
he's even adding ad-libs?]

767
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:56,320
[Giraffe showing some serious talent
at being the backup singer.]

768
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:03,310
[Even adding an upside down dancing.]

769
00:50:09,390 --> 00:50:11,640
[Red Team succeeds with
over 90 points!]

770
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:16,590
We won!

771
00:50:16,590 --> 00:50:17,740
[Passes the mission in first place.]

772
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:23,760
[Big trouble.]

773
00:50:24,530 --> 00:50:27,320
[An unbelievable amount of money is about to
be spent by one of the two remaining teams.]

774
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:33,960
[Each team to sing once more, and
whomever has the higher score wins!]

775
00:50:37,330 --> 00:50:40,750
I think the most important thing is
to sing as close to the mike as possible.

776
00:50:40,750 --> 00:50:42,190
I think you're right.

777
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:45,360
[The song they chose is, 'Tiger butterfly'.]

778
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:04,250
[The weights are just too much...]

779
00:51:17,060 --> 00:51:19,080
[Blank Ji struggling in her position.]

780
00:51:25,860 --> 00:51:27,950
[What...]

781
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:34,350
[Big-nosed Brother's voice
not heard even once during the song...]

782
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:39,230
- Suk Jin, what are you doing?
- Suk Jin...

783
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:43,500
[Still scores 72 points!]

784
00:51:44,380 --> 00:51:46,820
[Time for Green Team's final attempt!]

785
00:51:46,820 --> 00:51:48,650
The food's here!

786
00:51:52,410 --> 00:51:54,910
- Thanks for lunch!
- Thank you I'm going to enjoy it!

787
00:51:56,150 --> 00:51:57,400
That looks really good.

788
00:51:57,400 --> 00:51:59,740
<i>Suk Jin... are we done?</i>

789
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:12,150
Fighting... fighting!

790
00:52:13,230 --> 00:52:15,690
[Shin Yang channeling his discontent?]

791
00:52:16,110 --> 00:52:17,910
My leg was bothering me.

792
00:52:20,990 --> 00:52:24,010
<i>- You're a little jokester.
- You are! You're a little jokester.</i>

793
00:52:25,820 --> 00:52:27,300
<i>Fighting... fighting.</i>

794
00:52:27,670 --> 00:52:30,110
[The loser in this round has to
pay for the entire lunch bill!]

795
00:52:30,140 --> 00:52:31,640
[Extreme nervousness.]

796
00:52:33,180 --> 00:52:36,490
[Singing with all his might.]

797
00:52:37,410 --> 00:52:41,720
[Each separately singing earnestly
with their own workout equipment.]

798
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:12,700
[They have to beat Blue Team's 72 points
for them to escape last place standing.]

799
00:53:19,330 --> 00:53:22,420
[Blue Team wins with 72 points!]

800
00:53:24,810 --> 00:53:27,970
[Green Team chosen to pay for
the lunch bill.]

801
00:53:34,580 --> 00:53:36,560
The food doesn't look very appetizing to me.

802
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:40,150
[Crap!]

803
00:53:43,180 --> 00:53:45,180
- It's 980,000.
- What? That's more than what we thought.

804
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:48,510
[A total of 986,000 won including
extra items added to the order.]

805
00:53:48,510 --> 00:53:51,710
<i>- Thanks, Dong Hoon.
- I had no idea you'd treat like this.</i>

806
00:53:51,710 --> 00:53:53,750
- Thanks for lunch!
- Thank you. I really enjoyed it.

807
00:53:53,750 --> 00:53:59,980
[Including after meal dessert,
all of their bonus cash is now spent!]

808
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:02,260
<i>I just want to go home.</i>

809
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:06,160
[Green Team feeling empty after spending
all their bonus cash at lunch.]

810
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:11,740
[All they've got left is the 20,000 won
they earned with Shin Yang's splits.]

811
00:54:11,740 --> 00:54:12,950
The money we earned with your splits...

812
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:17,470
Had I known, I would've asked for
more money for doing the splits.

813
00:54:17,470 --> 00:54:18,990
No kidding.

814
00:54:18,990 --> 00:54:22,960
Just to earn 20,000 won...
I ripped my legs apart.

815
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:29,520
[But had he not done that,
they'd be penniless right now.]

816
00:54:31,420 --> 00:54:36,240
[Red Team: 840,000 won; Green Team: 20,000
won and the Blue Team: 990,000 won.]

817
00:54:37,490 --> 00:54:43,120
[Bonus Race - Final location.
SBS' Headquarters in Mokdong.]

818
00:54:44,570 --> 00:54:49,570
- This is where I won...
- We know! Stop bringing that up!

819
00:54:49,570 --> 00:54:53,560
- It's been two years now, stop it.
- This is where I shoved him off...

820
00:54:53,560 --> 00:54:55,530
This muscle man...
I shoved him aside and won.

821
00:54:56,750 --> 00:54:59,650
<i>Please take a mission card from
the table in front of you.</i>

822
00:54:59,650 --> 00:55:03,540
<i>[You'll only survive if you find the chair
with the General Manager's logo on it...]</i>

823
00:55:03,540 --> 00:55:04,880
<i>[and sit on the chair!]</i>

824
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:06,830
<i>[If you can't find the chair within
the allotted time, you're eliminated!]</i>

825
00:55:06,830 --> 00:55:08,630
<i>[The team with the survivor
is the ultimate victor!]</i>

826
00:55:08,630 --> 00:55:10,550
<i>There are six of those chairs
within this building right now.</i>

827
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:15,690
[Must be seated in the chair with the logo
when the time's up to remain alive.]

828
00:55:15,690 --> 00:55:21,390
<i>The chairs that you must sit on
have the GM's sticker stuck to the back.</i>

829
00:55:21,390 --> 00:55:25,180
<i>You must make sure to check that
the sticker is on the back of the chair.</i>

830
00:55:25,180 --> 00:55:30,590
<i>And only those six people sitting in the chair
will survive to go on to the next round.</i>

831
00:55:30,590 --> 00:55:33,760
[In other words,
it's a musical chair game of sorts.]

832
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:36,380
Wouldn't that put the teams with a lady
in their group at a disadvantage?

833
00:55:36,390 --> 00:55:38,850
I'm sorry to tell you this...

834
00:55:38,850 --> 00:55:41,420
But even with the last game,
it's your girl partner who won it for you.

835
00:55:42,540 --> 00:55:46,760
[A combination of competitiveness
and her fierce temper.]

836
00:55:47,490 --> 00:55:49,930
- If you joke too carelessly...
- I know that too.

837
00:55:49,930 --> 00:55:51,330
And Shin Yang is no joke either.

838
00:55:51,340 --> 00:55:55,130
He asked me if I wanted a piece of chocolate,
and when I said yes, he gave me stones.

839
00:55:55,130 --> 00:55:57,300
[Gives him chunks of stone
instead of chocolate!]

840
00:55:58,870 --> 00:56:01,470
I don't know what's gotten into him,
and why keeps acting like that.

841
00:56:01,470 --> 00:56:03,510
See how you feel when you have
only 20,000 won left in your pocket.

842
00:56:04,020 --> 00:56:05,950
I'm not the one who took
all that money away from you.

843
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:12,770
[Protect your seat! First round,
30 minutes, six chairs!]

844
00:56:12,770 --> 00:56:14,880
<i>- This is going to get interesting.
- Let's go!</i>

845
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:17,880
- Let's go this way.
- Suk Jin, I'm going to go that way.

846
00:56:22,360 --> 00:56:26,730
[Running Man members feeling anxious
right from the get go!]

847
00:56:26,730 --> 00:56:28,510
<i>I'm going to go up to the 18th floor,
and work my way down from there.</i>

848
00:56:29,570 --> 00:56:32,820
[No room for their personal
VJ's to get in...]

849
00:56:32,820 --> 00:56:34,130
Those of us who's VJ can't make it in here
just won't be shown on TV!

850
00:56:34,130 --> 00:56:35,770
There's nothing we can do.
It's cut and dry!

851
00:56:39,770 --> 00:56:41,740
[In the end,
the elevator gets on its way!]

852
00:56:41,740 --> 00:56:45,430
Where's Gwan Yeol? Gwan Yeol!
There you are!

853
00:56:46,340 --> 00:56:48,300
I'm going to get off on the sixth floor.

854
00:56:49,310 --> 00:56:52,070
- Not a single one of our Team's VJ is here.
- But you can use the CCTV.

855
00:56:56,450 --> 00:56:58,150
You're going to be seen on the CCTV.

856
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:00,650
<i>You're where?</i>

857
00:57:01,410 --> 00:57:04,390
[Red Team's Ji Won searching
through the sixth floor!]

858
00:57:05,350 --> 00:57:11,100
[Of all these countless chairs,
where are the ones marked with the logo?]

859
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:20,430
[Ji Won already discovers one?]

860
00:57:21,970 --> 00:57:23,920
I got the wrong one. This isn't it.
[Go Dong Wan.]

861
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:27,760
[PD Myuk.]
This isn't it. This is the PD's.

862
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:29,480
[Not with the GM's logo,
therefore, it's a fake!]

863
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:32,190
Just so that others will find this too.

864
00:57:32,190 --> 00:57:33,940
It was false alarm.

865
00:57:37,660 --> 00:57:41,370
[Shin Yang searched through 18th floor.]

866
00:57:42,260 --> 00:57:46,980
[When are they going to get the time
to search through all these chairs?]

867
00:57:58,290 --> 00:58:03,340
[16th floor - Variety show Department.
Running Man's office.]

868
00:58:04,100 --> 00:58:06,030
[There's something on back of the chair!]

869
00:58:07,970 --> 00:58:10,840
[Did the Giraffe discover one already?]

870
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:14,990
- Jong Kook!
- This one says PD Myuk...

871
00:58:14,990 --> 00:58:17,830
[It's PD Myuk's sticker is stuck
to the back of the chair...]

872
00:58:17,830 --> 00:58:19,440
[The chair that Kwang Soo found...]

873
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:20,990
It says Go Dong Wan on it.

874
00:58:20,990 --> 00:58:22,110
[The chair that Kwang Soo found has
Go Dong Wan's sticker on it.]

875
00:58:24,890 --> 00:58:26,330
Who are all these people?

876
00:58:27,110 --> 00:58:29,840
Why aren't there a single picture of us
when this is the Running Man office?

877
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:42,050
[What is he looking for all of a sudden?]

878
00:58:45,360 --> 00:58:48,960
[Finding a picture of himself in the calendar
and leaving it on his page...]

879
00:58:52,180 --> 00:58:55,450
[Blank Ji walking into the radio studio.]

880
00:58:55,450 --> 00:58:57,100
<i>Go Dong Wan...</i>

881
00:58:57,100 --> 00:58:58,970
<i>Seriously, Go Dong Wan...</i>

882
00:59:13,130 --> 00:59:14,620
Found it... I found it.

883
00:59:14,620 --> 00:59:16,970
[Finally discovers a chair marked
with General Manager's logo!]

884
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:21,000
[Hiding the chair in fear of
someone else finding it.]

885
00:59:22,940 --> 00:59:24,520
[That makes it look even more suspicious...]

886
00:59:31,660 --> 00:59:38,290
[Yoo-ruce Willis searching
through the 13th floor.]

887
00:59:42,190 --> 00:59:44,930
[He discovers another chair marked
with the correct logo on the back!]

888
00:59:45,460 --> 00:59:48,890
[Blue Team's Ji Hyo and Jae Suk
are both off to a good start!]

889
00:59:53,710 --> 00:59:57,490
[Since there's still a lot of time left,
hiding away the chair he's already found.]

890
00:59:57,490 --> 01:00:01,070
[Only those found sitting in the chairs when
the timer goes off will go on to second round]

891
01:00:01,070 --> 01:00:05,280
I can't believe how easily I found it.
I must be lucky... this is my lucky day.

892
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:08,020
I need to pretend I didn't find it,
and walk around like I'm still looking.

893
01:00:11,690 --> 01:00:13,440
I can't believe my good fortune!

894
01:00:22,700 --> 01:00:23,950
Ji Hyo!

895
01:00:23,950 --> 01:00:25,110
Did you find one?

896
01:00:25,110 --> 01:00:30,570
[Definitely our Ace... having come up all
the way up to the 13th floor with the chair.]

897
01:00:30,570 --> 01:00:32,520
- So that's what it looks like.
- Ji Hyo, get up for a second.

898
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:35,990
- Do I look stupid to you?
- No, no...

899
01:00:35,990 --> 01:00:38,410
- Kwang Soo...
- I just wanted to take a look.

900
01:00:38,410 --> 01:00:41,360
[Slowly walking away...]
Jong Kook, are you just going to leave?

901
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:45,470
Hey... instead of fighting with her,
I'd rather just go look for another one.

902
01:00:45,470 --> 01:00:47,380
- Hurry up and come.
- Why are you just leaving?

903
01:00:47,380 --> 01:00:48,900
<i>Come on. Look for another one.</i>

904
01:00:55,610 --> 01:00:59,940
[If he goes in there, he's going
to find my chair that I hid away!]

905
01:00:59,940 --> 01:01:02,540
- Where are these chairs?
- Jae Suk, Ji Hyo found one.

906
01:01:02,540 --> 01:01:06,300
[Jae Suk engaging them in a conversation
to stop them from entering the room.]

907
01:01:06,300 --> 01:01:07,690
- Have you not found one yet?
- No.

908
01:01:09,740 --> 01:01:12,260
- I can't find one anywhere.
- Which floor were you just on?

909
01:01:12,260 --> 01:01:15,260
- Ji Hyo is on this floor.
- Then I should head down more.

910
01:01:20,180 --> 01:01:21,210
That could've been bad.

911
01:01:26,180 --> 01:01:30,360
[Returning to the auditorium to check
that his chair is still safely hidden away.]

912
01:01:33,710 --> 01:01:35,060
It's still there.

913
01:01:35,430 --> 01:01:36,730
It's still back there.

914
01:01:43,220 --> 01:01:45,750
I keep circling around here as if I'm
protecting a safe or something.

915
01:01:46,530 --> 01:01:50,410
[Too nervous to leave the chair,
but can't really stay either...]

916
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:57,420
[Will that chair remain in
Jae Suk's possession to the end?]

917
01:01:59,240 --> 01:02:04,740
[On the other hand, Shin Yang of the
Green Team investigates 16th floor.]

918
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:11,000
I'm starting to feel a little anxious.

919
01:02:14,410 --> 01:02:19,480
[So many chairs around,
but the General Manager logo...]

920
01:02:20,410 --> 01:02:23,420
[Green Team's Shin Yang discovers
a chair with the right logo on the back!]

921
01:02:26,010 --> 01:02:29,670
[Everyone's on the same page.
Anyone who finds one, hides it.]

922
01:02:31,050 --> 01:02:34,110
[And Shin Yang goes the extra step...]

923
01:02:34,110 --> 01:02:38,530
[Even makes a fake sign!]

924
01:02:41,960 --> 01:02:45,180
[Park Shin Yang.]

925
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:48,190
Don't come into this room. Over.

926
01:02:56,220 --> 01:03:00,650
[On the other hand, Big-nosed Brother
works hard searching through sixth floor.]

927
01:03:00,650 --> 01:03:02,280
It's been awhile... it's really
been awhile since I've seen you.

928
01:03:03,210 --> 01:03:04,500
Long time no see.

929
01:03:07,710 --> 01:03:10,420
[A chair with PD Myuk's sticker
on the back.]

930
01:03:10,420 --> 01:03:12,140
It says PD Myuk. I thought I found it...

931
01:03:12,970 --> 01:03:15,280
[Oh? Did he discover a real
one this time?]

932
01:03:16,820 --> 01:03:20,760
[Blue Team's Big-nosed Brother also
finds a General Manager marked chair!]

933
01:03:20,760 --> 01:03:22,320
<i>Its all over if someone else
comes in here.</i>

934
01:03:27,470 --> 01:03:29,240
I need to find a spot where
I can stay hidden.

935
01:03:36,590 --> 01:03:40,930
[Since he has no confidence to win a fight,
he opts to take the chair and go into hiding.]

936
01:03:43,740 --> 01:03:47,030
[Moving to the furthest corner of
the editing room on the sixth floor.]

937
01:03:56,690 --> 01:04:01,290
[Using every ounce of energy he has
to hide the chair that he's found.]

938
01:04:02,330 --> 01:04:07,310
[If only the time will just pass
in this state...]

939
01:04:10,520 --> 01:04:13,630
[Come on time... pass by quickly!]

940
01:04:15,720 --> 01:04:20,560
[Hyena Ha Ha having secretly
watched the whole scene unfold.]

941
01:04:24,690 --> 01:04:26,100
Come in. This is Big-nose.

942
01:04:26,460 --> 01:04:27,860
<i>Did you find one?</i>

943
01:04:28,510 --> 01:04:29,890
I haven't found one yet.

944
01:04:30,470 --> 01:04:31,500
<i>You told me that you did.</i>

945
01:04:34,680 --> 01:04:36,420
It's because there's someone
lurking around me right now.

946
01:04:38,950 --> 01:04:42,520
[Without hesitation as soon as
Big-nosed Brother steps away!]

947
01:04:50,310 --> 01:04:52,400
[Big trouble!]

948
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:55,210
[Hyena Ha Ha steals the chair!]

949
01:04:57,810 --> 01:04:59,760
- I found the chair!
- I know!

950
01:05:01,130 --> 01:05:03,260
Since it's already come to this,
go and find yourself another chair.

951
01:05:03,260 --> 01:05:05,870
Isn't this the rules of the game
around here?

952
01:05:07,250 --> 01:05:11,450
[Of course you'll get caught after being
so obvious about hiding it...]

953
01:05:13,120 --> 01:05:15,630
You were so obvious hovering
around here nonstop.

954
01:05:18,120 --> 01:05:21,770
[Green Team's Ha Ha takes
over the chair!]

955
01:05:28,730 --> 01:05:31,440
[Time is slowly ticking away.]

956
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:36,920
[Gary searching around on the
seventh floor.]

957
01:05:42,410 --> 01:05:45,090
[Starting his search in the
corner closet room first.]

958
01:05:47,270 --> 01:05:48,580
Found it... I found it.

959
01:05:48,580 --> 01:05:51,870
[Wow! Gary discovers a chair with
the marker!]

960
01:05:51,880 --> 01:05:53,160
Okay, I'm just going to stay in here.

961
01:05:53,170 --> 01:05:55,350
[Seems as though he's planning on
sticking it out with the door locked.]

962
01:05:57,040 --> 01:06:00,910
[With this, every member of the
Green Team now has a chair in possession.]

963
01:06:00,920 --> 01:06:02,980
Just in case, I'm going to lock the door.

964
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:06,640
[Who's that?]

965
01:06:13,220 --> 01:06:16,920
[Gary opens the door!]

966
01:06:16,920 --> 01:06:18,940
- No, I haven't found one.
- Yes, you did!

967
01:06:18,940 --> 01:06:21,500
- Then why are you sitting down?
- I'm just taking a break from searching.

968
01:06:21,500 --> 01:06:23,410
- You did find one!
- No, I didn't.

969
01:06:23,410 --> 01:06:25,940
I haven't found one.
What are you doing?

970
01:06:25,940 --> 01:06:28,930
- You did find one!
- What... I don't know what to do!

971
01:06:28,930 --> 01:06:30,660
[Ji Won finally shows off her skills!]

972
01:06:30,660 --> 01:06:32,100
Wait!

973
01:06:34,470 --> 01:06:38,620
[With not much time left on the clock,
if he loses the chair, he'll be in trouble!]

974
01:06:38,620 --> 01:06:40,410
- I told you, I don't have one!
- You're sitting on one!

975
01:06:40,410 --> 01:06:43,660
I'm being attacked!
I'm being attacked my Uhm Ji Won!

976
01:06:43,660 --> 01:06:45,940
[Each asking for help from their
team member.]

977
01:06:45,950 --> 01:06:48,610
Eighth floor! Come to eighth floor!

978
01:06:53,830 --> 01:06:55,500
Jong Kook!

979
01:06:55,500 --> 01:06:57,710
- Jong Kook!
- Where do you think you're headed?

980
01:06:57,710 --> 01:06:59,590
[Red Team aggressively starts
their attack!]

981
01:06:59,590 --> 01:07:00,750
Wait!

982
01:07:00,750 --> 01:07:04,790
[Ha Ha and Shin Yang not coming to his rescue
since they're already seated in their chairs.]

983
01:07:04,790 --> 01:07:06,890
Hey! Hey!

984
01:07:07,750 --> 01:07:10,840
I can't give you this chair!
Hey! I only have 20,000 won left!

985
01:07:10,850 --> 01:07:12,670
I have nothing else to give!

986
01:07:15,100 --> 01:07:18,030
You can't be doing this to me!
Give it back!

987
01:07:18,030 --> 01:07:19,310
Hurry up and get out of here!

988
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:26,190
I think Kwang Soo is taking the chair
and running away from me. Isn't he?

989
01:07:26,190 --> 01:07:27,450
That traitor, Giraffe.

990
01:07:28,990 --> 01:07:32,550
[He'd do that and then some...]

991
01:07:33,480 --> 01:07:35,180
You took the chair and ran, didn't you!

992
01:07:37,240 --> 01:07:38,700
Ji Won...

993
01:07:40,620 --> 01:07:43,560
- We have to find another chair.
- You take it. I was going to give it to you.

994
01:07:43,840 --> 01:07:47,810
[Gary doesn't give up on the chair
and barges in after it!]

995
01:07:48,770 --> 01:07:50,600
Let's sit together!

996
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:51,810
If this is what it comes down to,
let's sit together!

997
01:07:51,810 --> 01:07:53,770
Let's die together then!
I can't just let it go!

998
01:07:53,770 --> 01:07:58,690
I have nothing else left!
My underwear is about to fall off!

999
01:07:58,690 --> 01:08:01,140
Fine! Take it all off!

1000
01:08:02,860 --> 01:08:05,220
I'm not doing a woman any favors today!

1001
01:08:06,920 --> 01:08:09,070
<i>Ji Won, hurry!
Get the chair out of here!</i>

1002
01:08:09,070 --> 01:08:10,910
Get on the elevator!

1003
01:08:12,740 --> 01:08:14,070
It's all over.

1004
01:08:14,710 --> 01:08:17,790
[Gary screaming to the end.]

1005
01:08:18,730 --> 01:08:20,600
If you don't want to lose your last
20,000 won, just stay quiet.

1006
01:08:29,630 --> 01:08:33,480
[Impala back on the search after having
his chair stolen by the Hyena.]

1007
01:08:33,480 --> 01:08:34,850
There's not much time left...

1008
01:08:42,480 --> 01:08:45,850
[Totally lucky! Big-nosed Brother
discovers another chair!]

1009
01:08:46,840 --> 01:08:49,810
Oh my God! This is a miracle.
I think I have a knack for finding things.

1010
01:08:51,170 --> 01:08:55,310
[If he can keep the chair for the next four
minutes, he'll go on to the next round.]

1011
01:09:00,780 --> 01:09:04,100
[Ah... what cruel fate...]

1012
01:09:04,100 --> 01:09:05,250
You found one?

1013
01:09:05,250 --> 01:09:10,480
[Anyone could see that he's found one
and is sitting on it to keep it.]

1014
01:09:11,030 --> 01:09:12,710
- Kwang Soo, I'm glad you're here.
- Hi, Jong Kook.

1015
01:09:13,290 --> 01:09:16,180
[Two members of the Red Team
are here!]

1016
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:21,060
[Now having the chair taken away from
him is just a matter of time?]

1017
01:09:21,070 --> 01:09:23,940
- It's not that...
- Don't feel upset by this, okay?

1018
01:09:25,420 --> 01:09:27,140
- Don't get upset by it.
- Okay, okay...

1019
01:09:27,950 --> 01:09:30,080
[Big-nosed Brother about to
make a proposal.]

1020
01:09:30,080 --> 01:09:33,610
Let's put the chair in the middle and
we'll all make a run for it, okay?

1021
01:09:33,610 --> 01:09:35,800
Stop trying to stall time.

1022
01:09:37,050 --> 01:09:40,110
[Tiger and the Giraffe moving right
into their take-over mode.]

1023
01:09:42,330 --> 01:09:45,570
[As predicted, a simple task to carry out.]

1024
01:09:46,750 --> 01:09:50,180
[Attempting to separate
Suk Jin from the chair.]

1025
01:09:50,510 --> 01:09:53,280
Okay, okay...
I'll be cool and just give it to you.

1026
01:09:53,280 --> 01:09:54,850
- I'm serious.
- No, you're already cool enough.

1027
01:09:55,530 --> 01:09:57,940
[What a cool position to be still
attached to the chair.]

1028
01:09:57,940 --> 01:10:00,090
Okay, fine...

1029
01:10:00,090 --> 01:10:03,730
- Let me at least hear you say thanks.
- Thanks. Thanks so much.

1030
01:10:03,730 --> 01:10:06,410
Let me hear you say thanks.
Seriously... how many times has it been?

1031
01:10:06,410 --> 01:10:08,600
[Big-nosed Brother heading off
to find himself another chair.]

1032
01:10:09,930 --> 01:10:11,520
I'm going to intertwine my leg
through this chair.

1033
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:14,450
[Tiger stakes his claim on the chair.]

1034
01:10:14,450 --> 01:10:17,540
I wonder if I'm too spread eagle?
I'm sorry...

1035
01:10:20,130 --> 01:10:21,960
I have no choice at the moment if
I don't want to have it taken away.

1036
01:10:33,460 --> 01:10:37,900
<i>[There are two minutes
remaining on the clock.]</i>

1037
01:10:39,010 --> 01:10:43,240
[It's almost time!
Time to find the chair to sit on...]

1038
01:10:45,160 --> 01:10:49,220
[Suk Jin having found his way all the way
here after having two chairs taken away.]

1039
01:10:49,230 --> 01:10:50,780
- Suk Jin...
- What's going on?

1040
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:55,340
- Did you find a chair?
- I heard you had it taken away twice?

1041
01:10:55,340 --> 01:10:57,000
- I did have it taken away twice.
- What are you going to do?

1042
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:00,500
Jong Kook... is on the eighth floor.
You don't think we could take him?

1043
01:11:02,930 --> 01:11:05,240
- Let's give it a try.
- I know that you're desperate...

1044
01:11:05,240 --> 01:11:07,980
- I have to try to survive.
- But...

1045
01:11:07,980 --> 01:11:10,550
Then I'll just have to find yours
to sit on it myself.

1046
01:11:10,550 --> 01:11:13,660
[Determined to find a chair even
if its own team member's chair?]

1047
01:11:14,950 --> 01:11:16,830
It's in there, isn't it? It is!

1048
01:11:19,120 --> 01:11:23,230
[As the first round is about to end,
Suk Jin doesn't care who the opponent is!]

1049
01:11:23,230 --> 01:11:26,140
- You had it hidden back here?
- Come on, this is...

1050
01:11:27,260 --> 01:11:30,880
How can you take your own team's chair?
[One minute left remaining.]

1051
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:33,810
There's only a minute left remaining.
You're getting the weird glint in your eye!

1052
01:11:35,610 --> 01:11:37,480
Seriously...

1053
01:11:37,480 --> 01:11:38,780
Get off that chair!

1054
01:11:40,160 --> 01:11:42,480
- Seriously... what are you doing?
- Let me live, okay?

1055
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:43,930
What are you doing?

1056
01:11:43,940 --> 01:11:44,960
<i>Ji Hyo!</i>

1057
01:11:45,440 --> 01:11:49,380
- Jae Suk, what's going on?
- Suk Jin has a weird glint in his eye.

1058
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:52,800
Suk Jin...

1059
01:11:53,320 --> 01:11:55,040
He's got a scary glint in his eye!

1060
01:11:55,050 --> 01:11:57,750
[Suk Jin starting to get violent.]

1061
01:11:58,730 --> 01:12:00,990
Suk Jin, you can't be like this!

1062
01:12:01,630 --> 01:12:06,080
[One minute left remaining.
One minute left remaining.]

1063
01:12:10,070 --> 01:12:12,360
[Someone is headed his way!]

1064
01:12:18,340 --> 01:12:20,320
[Giraffe attacks Ha Ha
as soon as he sees him!]

1065
01:12:22,110 --> 01:12:24,090
No way in hell!
No way in hell!

1066
01:12:24,090 --> 01:12:26,620
- There's no way in hell!
- Jong Kook! I'm on the seventh floor!

1067
01:12:26,620 --> 01:12:28,230
Seventh floor! Jong Kook!

1068
01:12:28,230 --> 01:12:30,010
Get off the chair! Let me sit in it!

1069
01:12:30,010 --> 01:12:31,800
[Blue Team - Internal struggles!]

1070
01:12:32,420 --> 01:12:34,120
- Suk Jin, seriously...
- Get down!

1071
01:12:34,620 --> 01:12:36,200
Jong Kook, where are you?

1072
01:12:37,420 --> 01:12:38,750
Jong Kook! Jong Kook!

1073
01:12:38,750 --> 01:12:41,300
[He came! The Tiger!]

1074
01:12:41,300 --> 01:12:44,170
[Came rolling in his chair to
save Kwang Soo!]

1075
01:12:47,430 --> 01:12:49,980
No way in hell! Hey! You thieves!

1076
01:12:51,300 --> 01:12:53,410
[But you stole the chair yourself...]

1077
01:12:55,820 --> 01:12:57,470
[Succeeds in separating Ha Ha
away from the chair!]

1078
01:12:59,560 --> 01:13:01,910
- There's no way! No way!
- Kwang Soo! Come on!

1079
01:13:09,120 --> 01:13:10,910
This is my chair!

1080
01:13:12,300 --> 01:13:16,940
[A total chaos! The time is over!]

1081
01:13:23,370 --> 01:13:27,220
[Time over - End of the first round.]

1082
01:13:27,220 --> 01:13:30,730
- End of the first round.
- It's over!

1083
01:13:31,410 --> 01:13:33,160
Yes! Kwang Soo is sitting in the chair!

1084
01:13:34,300 --> 01:13:37,790
[A very dramatic end to
the first round.]

1085
01:13:38,630 --> 01:13:41,750
[Shin Yang passes the first round
in comfort on the 16th floor.]

1086
01:13:41,750 --> 01:13:44,830
[Ji Hyo on the 13th floor and
Ji Won on the seventh floor also passes!]

1087
01:13:46,860 --> 01:13:49,490
The sticker on the chair!
Oh, there it is...

1088
01:13:52,480 --> 01:13:55,660
Dong Hoon, we're really sorry.
I didn't want to have to do that.

1089
01:13:55,660 --> 01:13:57,830
- I understand, Jong Kook.
- I'm sorry for having done that.

1090
01:13:57,830 --> 01:13:59,680
I stole that chair myself.

1091
01:14:00,250 --> 01:14:01,870
- Who did you steal it from?
- Suk Jin.

1092
01:14:04,450 --> 01:14:07,590
Do you know who I stole mine from?
Suk Jin.

1093
01:14:11,080 --> 01:14:12,230
Really?

1094
01:14:12,230 --> 01:14:16,930
- What the heck is this, Suk Jin?
- You could've stepped down from the chair.

1095
01:14:16,930 --> 01:14:21,620
- I miraculously found two of the six chairs.
- Why couldn't you have protected it?

1096
01:14:21,660 --> 01:14:22,870
It's unbelievable...

1097
01:14:22,870 --> 01:14:25,100
[In any case, three out of nine are out!]

1098
01:14:31,230 --> 01:14:35,930
[Six remaining survivors!
On to the second round!]

1099
01:14:35,930 --> 01:14:41,290
[Second round rules: 20 minutes on the clock!
And only three chairs to be found.]

1100
01:14:41,290 --> 01:14:44,420
[Only 50% chance of surviving
past the second round!]

1101
01:14:45,580 --> 01:14:50,320
[The location of the chairs are three of the
locations where the chairs were last at!]

1102
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:52,830
Ah... the last place we were at?

1103
01:14:54,060 --> 01:14:57,090
- Jong Kook, then we...
- Shh...

1104
01:14:57,630 --> 01:14:59,410
There...

1105
01:14:59,970 --> 01:15:02,230
[Seventh floor where we
were just at...]

1106
01:15:07,260 --> 01:15:09,220
Shin Yang, you're not on our team...

1107
01:15:10,030 --> 01:15:12,140
[Was just trying to get some information...]

1108
01:15:12,140 --> 01:15:15,160
- I can understand that you're lonely...
- Sorry.

1109
01:15:15,160 --> 01:15:16,260
[The only remaining survivor
on the Green Team.]

1110
01:15:16,270 --> 01:15:19,200
<i>[Second round starts now.]</i>

1111
01:15:20,120 --> 01:15:23,890
[Everyone headed to the place
where they were at last!]

1112
01:15:27,850 --> 01:15:31,420
[Tiger and the Giraffe headed to the
seventh floor where they were just at!]

1113
01:15:31,420 --> 01:15:33,490
Jong Kook! Wait!

1114
01:15:33,970 --> 01:15:37,810
- There will at least be one chair there...
- Okay, go after Jae Suk!

1115
01:15:37,810 --> 01:15:39,600
Go after him! I want you to go after him!

1116
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:41,750
No way... I can't handle him on my own.

1117
01:15:41,750 --> 01:15:43,990
Jong Kook! I can't handle him alone!

1118
01:15:43,990 --> 01:15:47,410
Just for there for now!
Kwang Soo!

1119
01:15:47,410 --> 01:15:49,480
Go after Jae Suk and radio me!

1120
01:15:49,480 --> 01:15:50,870
[Only one chair left in the spot
where they left the chairs!]

1121
01:15:50,870 --> 01:15:52,960
Go find Jae Suk and radio me
and tell me where he's at!

1122
01:16:01,530 --> 01:16:05,810
[Shin Yang arrives on the 16th floor where
he left the chair from the first round.]

1123
01:16:07,290 --> 01:16:11,780
[There it is! Shin Yang also finds a chair!]

1124
01:16:13,370 --> 01:16:17,550
I need to check and see what
the situation is like first.

1125
01:16:19,420 --> 01:16:24,440
If I see anyone that I want to
help out... then I'll help save them.

1126
01:16:32,200 --> 01:16:35,540
[What you doing?]

1127
01:16:38,310 --> 01:16:42,040
[Having decided to hide the chair for now
so that he doesn't have it taken away.]

1128
01:16:42,040 --> 01:16:44,530
Excuse me.
Is it okay for me to keep this in here?

1129
01:16:47,470 --> 01:16:50,360
[A staff member revealing
a hideout for the chair.]

1130
01:16:53,160 --> 01:16:54,310
Thank you.

1131
01:16:54,310 --> 01:16:57,790
[Even draping the chair with
his own clothes!]

1132
01:16:57,790 --> 01:17:00,320
<i>Thank you so much.
You're a life saver!</i>

1133
01:17:00,320 --> 01:17:01,500
[A perfect disguise.]

1134
01:17:02,150 --> 01:17:07,180
[Ji Won also heads to the back of the
seventh floor where she was last.]

1135
01:17:07,830 --> 01:17:08,870
It's not here.

1136
01:17:11,090 --> 01:17:13,360
[No longer in the spot!]

1137
01:17:14,240 --> 01:17:18,640
[Starting the search all over again
floor by floor!]

1138
01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:24,740
[It's got to be hard to have to start
the search over from the beginning...]

1139
01:17:24,740 --> 01:17:26,230
I have to start over!

1140
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:32,860
[Huh? Isn't this 13th floor where
Jae Suk had his chair?]

1141
01:17:33,650 --> 01:17:35,710
Maybe not these chairs
since they can't be moved?

1142
01:17:36,960 --> 01:17:38,650
What's that chair over there?

1143
01:17:45,250 --> 01:17:49,450
[The chair that Jae Suk had sat on
during the first round!]

1144
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:55,000
[Red Team's Ji Won
stakes her claim on the chair!]

1145
01:17:55,820 --> 01:17:57,140
Hide... go and hide somewhere.

1146
01:17:57,140 --> 01:17:59,520
Either hide behind the curtain...

1147
01:18:00,160 --> 01:18:01,600
Is there room back there?

1148
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:05,320
[Ji Won hides behind the
stage curtains just like Jae Suk had.]

1149
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,470
[She goes the extra step...]

1150
01:18:11,470 --> 01:18:14,560
[Carries it into the waiting room!]

1151
01:18:15,500 --> 01:18:19,180
[Extremely thorough Uhm Ji Won.]

1152
01:18:25,630 --> 01:18:27,670
[Green Team's Shin Yang is
heading her way!]

1153
01:18:37,820 --> 01:18:41,110
Go away! Don't come here... go!

1154
01:18:41,110 --> 01:18:42,300
[Coolly going away after a big laughter.]

1155
01:18:43,790 --> 01:18:46,860
He's really nice.
If he pushed his way in, I would've lost.

1156
01:18:46,860 --> 01:18:48,840
He really is gentle.

1157
01:18:51,590 --> 01:18:57,320
[Walking around with ease since he has
the chair he's hid away on the 16th floor.]

1158
01:19:01,590 --> 01:19:05,920
[Giraffe following Jae Suk around and
bothering him since the start of the round.]

1159
01:19:05,920 --> 01:19:09,150
Why don't we... why don't
we go to the ninth floor for now?

1160
01:19:09,680 --> 01:19:12,430
[Jae Suk finally arrives on the 13th floor.]

1161
01:19:12,430 --> 01:19:16,680
[Going around in circles to lose Kwang Soo.]

1162
01:19:16,690 --> 01:19:18,140
Jae Suk!

1163
01:19:19,130 --> 01:19:21,020
Why are you going around in circles?
You're making me dizzy.

1164
01:19:22,350 --> 01:19:24,970
[Blue Team's Ji Hyo also making her way over
not having found any of the chairs.]

1165
01:19:24,970 --> 01:19:29,270
[If the chair that Ji Hyo had
also disappeared...]

1166
01:19:29,270 --> 01:19:30,860
Then there's a high probability that the chair
Jae Suk had sat on is one of the chairs.

1167
01:19:30,860 --> 01:19:32,340
Where? Here?

1168
01:19:33,390 --> 01:19:35,450
- Why would it be here?
- I'm following Jae Suk around.

1169
01:19:35,460 --> 01:19:38,320
- Jae Suk wasn't here a little bit ago.
- No, I wasn't.

1170
01:19:38,920 --> 01:19:42,960
[Pesky Kwang Soo... now's the time!]

1171
01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:45,670
[Punishing Kwang Soo
and getting their retribution!]

1172
01:19:45,670 --> 01:19:47,490
All I've done is follow you around.

1173
01:19:47,490 --> 01:19:49,730
No! Not my shoes!

1174
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:52,660
Jae Suk, don't take off my shoes!

1175
01:19:52,660 --> 01:19:55,430
Jae Suk! Let me keep some dignity!

1176
01:19:55,430 --> 01:19:57,530
[Just in case he still decides to follow,
he even takes the socks away from him!]

1177
01:19:57,530 --> 01:19:59,150
Jae Suk, come on... Jae Suk!

1178
01:19:59,710 --> 01:20:02,740
[Leaving the rest to Ji Hyo and
rushing off to where he was the last time.]

1179
01:20:03,400 --> 01:20:06,560
Don't take my clothes off!
Wait... what's wrong with you!

1180
01:20:06,560 --> 01:20:08,450
You're driving me nuts!

1181
01:20:13,750 --> 01:20:16,660
[It used to be up here... but it's gone?]

1182
01:20:16,660 --> 01:20:20,270
[Then could it be back here?]

1183
01:20:24,860 --> 01:20:26,100
Ji Won...

1184
01:20:26,100 --> 01:20:28,220
[Discovers Ji Won hiding in the corner!]

1185
01:20:28,220 --> 01:20:29,560
Ji Won...

1186
01:20:31,070 --> 01:20:33,550
- Ji Won, listen... calm down.
- No!

1187
01:20:34,920 --> 01:20:37,590
[Scream!]

1188
01:20:38,890 --> 01:20:41,040
Yoo Jae Suk's here!

1189
01:20:41,040 --> 01:20:42,900
No, I'm the one who discovered you.

1190
01:20:42,900 --> 01:20:45,220
- I discovered Yoo Jae Suk...
- You're not the one who discovered me.

1191
01:20:45,220 --> 01:20:48,170
- Ji Hyo, Ji Hyo, Ji Hyo...
- Come where I was last at!

1192
01:20:48,180 --> 01:20:49,490
Hurry up and get here!

1193
01:20:49,490 --> 01:20:51,280
Okay, Jae Suk. Where are you?

1194
01:20:52,490 --> 01:20:53,930
What does she mean?
The place where we were last?

1195
01:20:54,640 --> 01:20:57,460
I have to get to my chair
and sit on it right now though...

1196
01:20:57,460 --> 01:20:59,230
There's no time!

1197
01:21:00,180 --> 01:21:01,590
I have to hurry!

1198
01:21:05,710 --> 01:21:08,610
[There's no time!
An extremely urgent situation!]

1199
01:21:08,610 --> 01:21:11,090
- Ji Hyo, hurry!
- I've got Yoo Jae Suk!

1200
01:21:14,760 --> 01:21:17,560
[What! Giraffe is the first to arrive here?]

1201
01:21:18,410 --> 01:21:21,170
[With revenge nailed deep
within his heart.]

1202
01:21:22,670 --> 01:21:24,420
- Ji Hyo!
- You stripped off my feet!

1203
01:21:25,070 --> 01:21:27,080
You took away my shoes and took my socks off!

1204
01:21:27,080 --> 01:21:29,230
Ji Hyo, hurry! Ji Hyo!

1205
01:21:29,230 --> 01:21:30,270
Ji Hyo!

1206
01:21:30,270 --> 01:21:32,930
[At a quick glance, it may come across
looking like a steamy love scene.]

1207
01:21:37,820 --> 01:21:40,180
[Blue Team's rescuer, Ace Ji Hyo arrives!]

1208
01:21:40,180 --> 01:21:43,010
Come help me! Or run away!

1209
01:21:43,010 --> 01:21:44,720
Ji Won, run!

1210
01:21:45,750 --> 01:21:49,560
[Ji Hyo needs to rush over and take
the chair away from Ji Won!]

1211
01:21:51,070 --> 01:21:52,270
<i>Ji Hyo, hurry!</i>

1212
01:21:52,270 --> 01:21:56,670
<i>[One minute left remaining.
One minute left remaining.]</i>

1213
01:22:00,790 --> 01:22:02,680
Kwang Soo... I've got to go.

1214
01:22:05,930 --> 01:22:07,510
Why would you take off my clothes?

1215
01:22:13,810 --> 01:22:16,630
Don't step on my foot!

1216
01:22:16,630 --> 01:22:18,490
Outbreak of total chaos.

1217
01:22:20,370 --> 01:22:23,620
[There's no time!
Just who will end up with the chair?]

1218
01:22:23,620 --> 01:22:25,090
Ji Won, I'm sorry!

1219
01:22:25,090 --> 01:22:28,220
No! I'm a guest!

1220
01:22:28,220 --> 01:22:29,640
Ji Won...

1221
01:22:29,940 --> 01:22:32,590
I'm going to kick you where it hurts!

1222
01:22:34,100 --> 01:22:38,040
- Ji Won!
- My foot is where it's going to hurt you!

1223
01:23:00,870 --> 01:23:04,630
[End of second round.
Ji Hyo takes the seat!]

1224
01:23:05,260 --> 01:23:10,130
[End of the 2nd round: Red Team's Jong Kook;
Green Team's Shin Yang; Blue Team's Ji Hyo.]

1225
01:23:10,140 --> 01:23:13,160
- It's over...
- Where are my socks and shoes?

1226
01:23:13,160 --> 01:23:14,550
Where's my jacket?

1227
01:23:14,550 --> 01:23:18,200
[Rather than worrying about winning,
maybe take care of the Giraffe first...]

1228
01:23:18,210 --> 01:23:19,770
<i>Ji Hyo, you have to stay alive.</i>

1229
01:23:19,770 --> 01:23:22,490
- Ji Hyo, you have to stay alive.
- Who else is still alive?

1230
01:23:22,490 --> 01:23:23,660
I'm sure Jong Kook's still alive.

1231
01:23:23,660 --> 01:23:27,190
[Ace Ji Hyo having survived with
her fierce competitive streak.]

1232
01:23:27,190 --> 01:23:29,050
<i>Why is Ji Hyo so strong?</i>

1233
01:23:30,360 --> 01:23:32,700
I really didn't use any strength
in case you'd get hurt.

1234
01:23:32,700 --> 01:23:34,850
That was you not using any strength?
Seriously...

1235
01:23:35,950 --> 01:23:38,090
Stop trying to act like you're nice!

1236
01:23:40,260 --> 01:23:43,310
- I'm sorry, Ji Won.
- I've got you all figured out.

1237
01:23:43,990 --> 01:23:47,700
[Anyways, one survivor per team!
Time to go into the last round!]

1238
01:23:49,050 --> 01:23:50,540
<i>Kwang Soo!</i>

1239
01:23:50,540 --> 01:23:52,230
<i>Jae Suk and Kwang Soo...
and Ji Won.</i>

1240
01:23:52,780 --> 01:23:55,960
- Shin Yang is still alive!
- I knew it would end up like this.

1241
01:23:55,960 --> 01:23:57,870
- Ji Hyo's still alive?
- Yeah, Ji Hyo's still alive.

1242
01:23:57,870 --> 01:24:00,360
- I'm sorry.
- I think Jong Kook is going to win this.

1243
01:24:01,020 --> 01:24:05,110
Ji Won, seriously... I think
she's the fiercest guest we've had.

1244
01:24:05,650 --> 01:24:09,510
- My mental state right now...
- Why? Did she hurt you?

1245
01:24:09,510 --> 01:24:11,370
No, not hurt.
But she really caught me by surprise.

1246
01:24:11,670 --> 01:24:13,620
'I'm a guest... I'm a guest!'

1247
01:24:13,630 --> 01:24:14,770
['I'm a guest... I'm a guest!']

1248
01:24:14,770 --> 01:24:16,970
'If you keep this up, I'm
going to kick you where it hurts!'

1249
01:24:18,250 --> 01:24:20,080
'My foot is right by that area right now!'

1250
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:23,430
'It's right in front of my foot!
I'm going to kick it! I'm kicking it!'

1251
01:24:23,770 --> 01:24:27,390
[Boisterous lady quieting down
now that she's in jail.]

1252
01:24:28,020 --> 01:24:31,260
[Now the final third round.]

1253
01:24:31,900 --> 01:24:37,900
[Out of the three chairs that were on
the 16th, 13th and the seventh floor...]

1254
01:24:37,900 --> 01:24:40,780
[Now there's only one single chair
left remaining!]

1255
01:24:40,780 --> 01:24:46,710
[Round three! Only 10 minutes on the clock!
Take over the last remaining chair!]

1256
01:24:46,710 --> 01:24:48,820
This is like Russian Roulette.

1257
01:24:48,820 --> 01:24:52,230
<i>[We will now start our third
and final round.]</i>

1258
01:24:52,230 --> 01:24:53,510
Go!

1259
01:24:53,540 --> 01:24:58,770
[Where they head now could be the
deciding factor on who wins the race!]

1260
01:25:03,620 --> 01:25:06,100
[Jong Kook and Ji Hyo rushed
to head in the same direction!]

1261
01:25:07,960 --> 01:25:12,430
[The 13th floor?]

1262
01:25:12,430 --> 01:25:15,280
[The last General Manager chair is here!]

1263
01:25:17,300 --> 01:25:20,270
[Red Team's Jong Kook's
gut instinct pays off!]

1264
01:25:21,670 --> 01:25:23,690
This is nerve wrecking.

1265
01:25:24,340 --> 01:25:26,950
[Ace Ji Hyo is
unfortunately one step too late.]

1266
01:25:26,950 --> 01:25:30,060
It really was on this floor.
This is unbelievable.

1267
01:25:30,530 --> 01:25:33,980
My gut instincts... it really is...

1268
01:25:33,980 --> 01:25:35,240
[What is he doing?]

1269
01:25:36,620 --> 01:25:39,740
[Mr. Capable molds his body to the chair!]

1270
01:25:40,550 --> 01:25:45,780
- Earlier... Uhm Ji Won said something...
- What?

1271
01:25:47,200 --> 01:25:49,380
'I'm going to kick you where it hurts.'

1272
01:25:49,380 --> 01:25:51,110
<i>'I'm going to kick you where it hurts.'</i>

1273
01:25:53,600 --> 01:25:54,890
How can you say such a thing? Hey...

1274
01:25:55,130 --> 01:25:56,640
[Right here, a few minutes ago...]

1275
01:25:57,670 --> 01:26:00,310
[Switching his direction from fear
of getting hurt.]

1276
01:26:02,440 --> 01:26:06,840
[Shin Yang heads down after having
checked that it's not on the 16th floor.]

1277
01:26:06,840 --> 01:26:08,670
[There it is...]

1278
01:26:08,670 --> 01:26:10,700
- Why don't you have a seat...
- Was this your chair?

1279
01:26:10,700 --> 01:26:12,990
- This one?
- Yes, Shin Yang...

1280
01:26:13,620 --> 01:26:16,420
- Why don't you have a seat?
- Is it okay to sit like that?

1281
01:26:18,140 --> 01:26:21,070
Is it okay... to have your legs
intertwined through the chair like that?

1282
01:26:21,070 --> 01:26:22,300
- Excuse me?
- Huh?

1283
01:26:24,310 --> 01:26:26,600
Since there's still a lot of time left,
why don't we talk about it first?

1284
01:26:26,600 --> 01:26:30,600
- Let's talk about this...
- I'm checking to see how I can pull you out.

1285
01:26:31,330 --> 01:26:32,930
Why are you trying to do that?

1286
01:26:32,930 --> 01:26:34,660
- I can beat you with one move.
- What?

1287
01:26:34,660 --> 01:26:36,030
- I can do it in one shot.
- Me?

1288
01:26:36,490 --> 01:26:40,430
- How are you going to do that?
- I can do it within five seconds.

1289
01:26:40,430 --> 01:26:41,890
[Take Mr. Capable down within
five seconds?]

1290
01:26:41,890 --> 01:26:43,630
You're going to pull me off this chair?

1291
01:26:43,630 --> 01:26:45,230
No. I'm saying I'm going to
sit on it with you.

1292
01:26:46,350 --> 01:26:48,590
[I will share the seat with you!]

1293
01:26:48,590 --> 01:26:50,920
Me too! Me too!

1294
01:26:52,060 --> 01:26:54,030
Me too! Include me!

1295
01:26:54,030 --> 01:26:55,180
[Taking it from you may be too difficult...]

1296
01:26:55,180 --> 01:26:58,410
Jong Kook is trying to win by
dragging the time right now.

1297
01:26:58,410 --> 01:27:01,940
No, Shin Yang. If you've seen me
on the show, you'd know...

1298
01:27:01,940 --> 01:27:04,260
You won't be able to do it. Shin Yang...

1299
01:27:06,300 --> 01:27:08,960
Shin Yang! Let's talk this out.

1300
01:27:08,960 --> 01:27:10,310
Shin Yang!

1301
01:27:11,130 --> 01:27:15,860
[The last three survivors vying
for the final victory.]

1302
01:27:16,350 --> 01:27:20,900
[If he doesn't abdicate his seat within
10 seconds, the attack will commence!]

1303
01:27:20,900 --> 01:27:25,270
One... two... three...

1304
01:27:26,080 --> 01:27:30,350
[Just how to respond to the comment...
so unsure of what to do...]

1305
01:27:30,350 --> 01:27:31,570
Six...

1306
01:27:31,570 --> 01:27:36,850
[Time left on the clock...
One minute and 13 seconds.]

1307
01:27:37,710 --> 01:27:39,180
Ten!

1308
01:27:40,200 --> 01:27:42,970
[No more warning!]

1309
01:27:42,970 --> 01:27:44,570
[Mr. Capable in extreme danger!]

1310
01:27:45,510 --> 01:27:46,800
Shin Yang!

1311
01:27:46,800 --> 01:27:49,170
No, Shin Yang! Shin Yang!

1312
01:27:49,690 --> 01:27:51,900
Shin Yang! No!

1313
01:27:51,900 --> 01:27:56,120
I want to win!
It's been too long since I've won!

1314
01:27:57,990 --> 01:28:01,540
[Park Shin Yang shows the strength
that he's kept hidden!]

1315
01:28:17,240 --> 01:28:20,450
[Ji Hyo resorts to tickling his foot!]

1316
01:28:22,750 --> 01:28:26,480
I'm okay! I'm okay...
I don't feel anything.

1317
01:28:27,780 --> 01:28:33,730
[Extreme skills? Enduring
the tickling through a mantra?]

1318
01:28:33,730 --> 01:28:36,230
This isn't going to work.
Sorry about this!

1319
01:28:36,230 --> 01:28:39,370
- Sorry! I'm going in!
- Hurry up and sit down!

1320
01:28:40,310 --> 01:28:41,940
I'm going in!

1321
01:28:41,940 --> 01:28:44,540
[Shin Yang shoving his way in!]

1322
01:28:45,230 --> 01:28:49,780
[Two people in the chair!
How will it turn out?]

1323
01:28:49,780 --> 01:28:55,280
[Who will be the final victor to sit in
the chair to keep their bonus cash?]

1324
01:29:01,510 --> 01:29:04,540
[Time over!]

1325
01:29:05,890 --> 01:29:09,060
[How will this be judged?]

1326
01:29:11,770 --> 01:29:15,980
[An extremely difficult situation to judge.]

1327
01:29:15,980 --> 01:29:18,030
You're not sitting properly.

1328
01:29:18,030 --> 01:29:21,820
- I protected the chair to the end.
- No, his butt is sitting on it.

1329
01:29:21,820 --> 01:29:23,820
[Carefully inspecting to see if his butt
is touching the bottom of the seat.]

1330
01:29:23,820 --> 01:29:26,650
- His butt is not on the chair.
- We'd have to get up to see.

1331
01:29:27,520 --> 01:29:32,070
<i>We're going to discuss this
before we rule the judging.</i>

1332
01:29:32,070 --> 01:29:34,340
[Final ruling to be announced in a bit.]

1333
01:29:34,930 --> 01:29:39,340
[Judging aside, they'd need to get up...]

1334
01:29:41,690 --> 01:29:44,360
- I need some help...
- Wait... that really tickles.

1335
01:29:45,950 --> 01:29:50,710
[With both of them so stuck on the chair,
separating them is proving difficult.]

1336
01:29:57,150 --> 01:29:59,900
[Barely manages to get
Shin Yang separated.]

1337
01:30:02,030 --> 01:30:05,490
My body right now...
please don't touch me.

1338
01:30:05,490 --> 01:30:08,740
[Impossible to help Mr. Capable
in his state.]

1339
01:30:08,740 --> 01:30:12,670
- You want me to lift this up?
- I'm too embarrassed right now!

1340
01:30:14,100 --> 01:30:18,820
[First real photo opportunity of 2013.]

1341
01:30:19,840 --> 01:30:24,000
[Just what will the final judgment be?]

1342
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:25,690
- I'm really curious.
- Here they come.

1343
01:30:25,690 --> 01:30:27,770
<i>I think it's going to be Jong Kook.</i>

1344
01:30:27,770 --> 01:30:31,970
- Look at Jong Kook struggling.
- I can't walk without the support.

1345
01:30:31,970 --> 01:30:35,560
[Everyone arriving looking worse
for wear.]

1346
01:30:37,810 --> 01:30:40,930
They decision hasn't been made yet.
Decision will be made from the footage.

1347
01:30:40,930 --> 01:30:42,280
- Really?
- Really?

1348
01:30:42,290 --> 01:30:44,210
<i>The results from having
watched the footage...</i>

1349
01:30:44,220 --> 01:30:46,430
<i>This is a first in the history
of Running Man.</i>

1350
01:30:46,430 --> 01:30:48,910
<i>It's a mutual win by the Red Team
and the Green Team.</i>

1351
01:30:48,920 --> 01:30:51,160
What? We both won?

1352
01:30:51,160 --> 01:30:53,130
<i>This is the first time we've
had this situation.</i>

1353
01:30:54,510 --> 01:30:58,220
[Both sitting on the chair!
A definite win for both teams!]

1354
01:31:02,140 --> 01:31:04,720
[A first in history of Running Man!
Two teams share a win!]

1355
01:31:07,210 --> 01:31:08,840
<i>With it being a mutual win...</i>

1356
01:31:08,840 --> 01:31:12,780
<i>Decide who will go first to see whether
your bonus will be doubled or tripled...</i>

1357
01:31:12,780 --> 01:31:15,140
- Why don't you go first?
- They're not going to win much.

1358
01:31:15,140 --> 01:31:17,800
At most, they'll win 60,000 won.
How much did you guys have left?

1359
01:31:17,800 --> 01:31:19,430
We have a lot left.
We have 840,000 won left.

1360
01:31:19,430 --> 01:31:23,040
[Red Team's current leftover is
840,000 won.]

1361
01:31:23,040 --> 01:31:25,330
- Come over here...
- They can win up to 252,000,000 won.

1362
01:31:25,330 --> 01:31:28,890
[Green Team is given the chance to
maximize their money first.]

1363
01:31:28,890 --> 01:31:30,830
You just need to open up the flap.

1364
01:31:30,830 --> 01:31:32,360
Shin Yang?

1365
01:31:34,780 --> 01:31:36,590
One, two, three!

1366
01:31:42,500 --> 01:31:49,700
[Depending on the ball they pick,
their amount could change drastically!]

1367
01:31:53,370 --> 01:31:55,300
Congratulations on your 20,000 won.

1368
01:31:56,270 --> 01:31:58,010
[What? Multiplied by one?]

1369
01:31:58,010 --> 01:32:01,420
[Green Team- 20,000 won x 1= 20,000 won.]

1370
01:32:01,910 --> 01:32:04,000
- Multiplied by...
- It's the money he earned from the splits?

1371
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,070
At least you got something, right?

1372
01:32:06,460 --> 01:32:10,320
[It's the Red Team's chance to
increase their bonus cash amount!]

1373
01:32:11,640 --> 01:32:13,240
Pull it up.

1374
01:32:14,560 --> 01:32:16,240
[She picks one!]

1375
01:32:17,610 --> 01:32:23,350
[Red Team's 840,000 won... will they...]

1376
01:32:23,350 --> 01:32:25,110
I wonder if there's a times zero?

1377
01:32:25,110 --> 01:32:29,770
The number...
that the Red Team picked is...

1378
01:32:29,770 --> 01:32:31,380
Please... please!

1379
01:32:31,380 --> 01:32:37,860
[Out of the three options,
which one did they get?]

1380
01:32:38,440 --> 01:32:39,900
This is disappointing.

1381
01:32:39,900 --> 01:32:42,000
- Is it one?
- Three.

1382
01:32:43,260 --> 01:32:48,050
[840,000 won x 3=252,000,000 won.]

1383
01:32:48,050 --> 01:32:54,870
[Blue Team succeeds in tripling
their bonus cash!]

1384
01:32:54,870 --> 01:32:57,020
- Wow! Seriously!
- Wow...

1385
01:33:00,100 --> 01:33:01,650
It's for real.

1386
01:33:01,650 --> 01:33:04,430
- And for us... 20,000 won.
- I can't believe this.

1387
01:33:04,440 --> 01:33:07,670
- It's still something.
- Shin Yang earned that money.

1388
01:33:08,330 --> 01:33:13,730
[The 20,000 won he earned by doing
the splits during the karaoke mission.]

1389
01:33:15,150 --> 01:33:16,810
He's giving snack money to the kids.

1390
01:33:16,810 --> 01:33:18,580
How much?
How much did you guys get?

1391
01:33:18,580 --> 01:33:20,210
- 252,000,000 won.
- 252,000,000 won.

1392
01:33:21,200 --> 01:33:23,640
Shall we go for 500,000,000 won...

1393
01:33:23,640 --> 01:33:27,330
[The splits?]

1394
01:33:27,990 --> 01:33:32,780
[The prize money was donated to the
Indonesia Relief Fund by the Blue Team.]
