[Running Man Team determined to win.]

168
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:49,250
- Let's really shock them.
- Okay.

169
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:52,870
<i>Wow... it's been so long since
I've been to a sleigh park like this one.</i>

170
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,270
[Sleigh park reminiscent of the past.]

171
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:57,490
- This is...
- So this is what a sleigh park is like.

172
00:08:58,250 --> 00:08:59,980
I wonder what we'll be doing here.

173
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:03,560
<i>This is a sleigh park reminiscent
of our past.</i>

174
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:07,160
<i>Team Running Man should be familiar
with a park like this, right?</i>

175
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,510
- Of course.
- No! This is my first time here.

176
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:12,690
- We've never done it when we were little.
- You've never done this before?

177
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:14,770
We've never done it either when
we were little. So this is good then.

178
00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:17,780
- We've never done it before either.
- We don't know how to do it either.

179
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:19,530
[We're still young!]

180
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:21,520
There's not much difference in age
between them and myself.

181
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:24,180
<i>The first competition of
2013 Running Man Olympics is...</i>

182
00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:26,090
<i>It's sleigh ski.</i>

183
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:27,120
What?

184
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,470
- Sleigh ski?
- Sleigh ski?

185
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:33,030
<i>Instead of using batons,
you'll be passing off your sleigh sticks.</i>

186
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:36,790
<i>And the team that reaches the finish line
first wins the competition.</i>

187
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:44,280
<i>Kwang Soo, you're standing too close
to the camera. You need to move over.</i>

188
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:47,330
[Are you a staff member or an actor?]

189
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:51,340
- I thought you were our new cameraman.
- I thought he was one of our team members!

190
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,310
[Camera Team eyeing
the Giraffe for his tall height.]

191
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:03,210
One thing that we're sure of, Kwang Hee,
Joon and Jong Hyun, the three of them...

192
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:05,870
- They're no worries!
- No, we're not like that.

193
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:08,340
These are the Idols that we want!

194
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:10,550
Idols here to give us more laughter!

195
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:12,760
We're the leaders of K-pop!

196
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:16,030
Then I'm the leader of hip hop.

197
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:20,500
You know what Kwang Hee said?
'What if I eliminate Jong Kook?'

198
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:23,750
You're going to eliminate Jong Kook?
That'll be a hoot.

199
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,370
- I think that would be a real hoot.
- Should we give people some laughs today?

200
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,830
- Joon, what number are you?
- I'm number five.

201
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:32,030
- I'm the fifth runner.
- Really?

202
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:33,860
Since Joon's number five,
then I'm number five too.

203
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:37,000
Jong Kook, which number are you?

204
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:39,630
- He's the seventh.
- Jong Kook is the seventh runner.

205
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:40,790
I'm the seventh runner, Min Ho.

206
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,370
Min Ho and Jong Kook go to
the same gym.

207
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:47,870
Jong Kook mentioned earlier
that he's going to win.

208
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:48,870
Me too!

209
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,360
[Both showing off
their arm strength and speed.]

[Each player to their positions.]

212
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:04,380
- Suk Jin, are you number one?
- I'm number one. You are too?

213
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:05,450
[Suk Jin vs. Kwang Hee.]

214
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:07,170
I'm not kidding around right now.

215
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:08,820
- How old are you?
- What?

216
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:10,080
He was born in 1966.

217
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,750

[Old enough to be his father.
Competition between the generations.]

220
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:21,770
- Can you give me any tips?
- No, I can't give you that.

221
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:23,790
How much tip should I give you?

222
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:27,200
- Come on, any know hows?
- Okay, okay...

223
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:30,250
We have to win this.
We have to win before we go.

the sleigh race!]

231

[This is my win!
I'm 22 years younger than him!]

232
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:03,830

235
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:12,760

embarrassing the Idol Team from the get go.]

[He definitely is different than the
other Idol members on his team...]

How can you be in such horrible
physical condition at your age?

- You have to be careful of the corners!
- That's right!

You can't speed up
when you're rounding a corner!

348

Jong Kook, have you never ridden
one of these sleighs before?

349
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:42,130
It's because you kicked him
during the race when he was going!

Jong Kook, you're starting
to really decline.

366

You're getting easier to defeat lately.

367

My conclusion is that you may be strong,
but you don't know how to use your strength.

- Did you see Sulli's expression?
- I was totally annoyed!

385

She said that so sincerely.

I knew that you wouldn't be very good,
but I had no idea you'd be that bad.

- Don't go easy on us because we're juniors.

pretended to be a weakling on purpose.

- Then I'll anticipate your next game.
- Okay.

Lee Kwang Soo, seriously...</i>

499
00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:35,760
Dong Hoon, come in
and Suk Jin, get out there.

500
00:29:39,090 --> 00:29:40,400
[When do I get to play...]

501
00:29:42,610 --> 00:29:45,040
[An unbelievable defense by L.]

502
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:49,890
[And a chance to shoot!]

503
00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:53,090
[Huh?]

504
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:55,640
[Joon having hit it out of the way
before Suk Jin could even shoot.]

505
00:29:57,570 --> 00:29:58,970
Where did it go?

506
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:09,220
- Hey!
- What's wrong with you, Suk Jin?

507
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:10,610
How old are you?

508
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:13,900
[It may have been a bad move
to trade out the players?]

509
00:30:15,490 --> 00:30:17,640
[Kwang Soo's time in the penalty box is up,
and it's time for him to get back in!]

510
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:19,380
Lee Kwang Soo! Trade out!

511
00:30:20,810 --> 00:30:23,460
[Trades out for Jae Suk.]

512

[Kwang Hee finally enters the game.]

513
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:30,490
Kwang Hee, start running.

514
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,100
I'm sure everyone's starting
to feel tired.

515
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:36,680
Your chance is now. You have to help them.
I'm sure they're all feeling tired.

516

[That... that...]

517

[It's too fierce out there...]

518
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:47,150
[Will I be able to stand up
to that Tiger?]

519
00:30:47,150 --> 00:30:48,920
[What do I do?]

520
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:52,370
[Getting down to his knees in defeat?]

521
00:30:52,370 --> 00:30:53,980
What are you doing?

522
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:55,430
Hurry!

523
00:30:57,090 --> 00:31:00,130
- Hurry! Hurry up and get in there.
- I'm too scared.

524
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:04,000
[Still competing with 0-0 score.]

525
00:31:10,390 --> 00:31:13,170
[The game now rife with screams
after Kwang Hee joins.]

526
00:31:15,090 --> 00:31:17,970
[Backing up again?]

527
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:19,430
Go away!

528
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:22,250
[I'm too scared...]

529
00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:26,440
Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes!

530
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:28,800
[Here, get a taste of this.]

531
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:34,150
Kwang Hee... Kwang Hee... you okay?

532
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:40,330
[Using the moment of chaos...]

533
00:31:40,330 --> 00:31:42,590
[Yong Hwa steals the puck.]

534
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:46,960
[A chance to shoot a goal!]

535
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:51,340
[A one on one chance with goalie, Ji Hyo.]

536
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:57,560
[Amazing! She blocks it again.]

537
00:31:58,770 --> 00:32:01,110
[But then...]

538
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:05,840
[Jong Hyun having followed behind
gets a chance at rebound!]

539
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:15,410
[Jong Hyun's shooting is a success!]

540
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:24,390
- I didn't see it...
- You did good.

541
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:26,490
[Yay... this is exciting.]

542
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:32,110
[Idol Team: 1, Running Man Team: 0]

543
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:34,380
- Who scored?
- Jong Hyun did.

544
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:37,380
Jae Suk, you have to play better defense.

545
00:32:37,870 --> 00:32:40,020
- I'll play defense.
- Fighting!

546
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:42,960
- Hurry up while Jong Kook isn't here.
- I'll score a goal while Jong Kook's out.

547
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:43,760
[This is their chance while
Jong Kook is out!]

548
00:32:47,970 --> 00:32:50,640
[Idol Team not hesitating to attack
with Mr. Capable out of the game.]

549
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,610
You can't just block the puck.
You have to block their bodies too!

550
00:32:57,780 --> 00:33:00,020
[Oh... Haroro's breakthrough.]

551
00:33:02,210 --> 00:33:04,350
[Ah... unfortunately hits
the goal posts and misses!]

552
00:33:10,770 --> 00:33:13,420
[Breaking out in a scuffle
all of a sudden?]

553
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:16,900
[Instigating a brawl for no reason with
Ace Yong Hwa in his grasp.]

554
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,300
Both of you in the penalty box
for the next minute!

555
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:25,050
[Acting as though he's furious.]

556
00:33:26,390 --> 00:33:28,880
[Breaking out into another brawl?]

557
00:33:32,530 --> 00:33:36,140
[A deliberate brawl in attempt to get their
opponent's Ace thrown out of the game.]

558

[Ha Ha goes into the
penalty box for the next minute.]

559
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:41,720
Do a body check! A body check!

560
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:45,680
[But the others are still in
midst of the brawl that was started.]

561
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:49,820
[The whole group jumps into the scuffle.]

562

[During the midst of all this chaos...]

563
00:34:01,990 --> 00:34:03,650
[The puck having broken free...]

564
00:34:05,030 --> 00:34:07,020
[L's sole chance!]

565
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:11,520
[Another one on one chance with
Goalie Blank Ji!]

566
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:15,250
[Shoots with all his might!]

[The puck unfortunately misses the goal...]

[Running Man Team escapes danger.]

569

[What are you going to do
about your pants?]

571
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:43,310
- Look. His pants fell off.
- Wait! Time!

572
00:34:45,370 --> 00:34:47,230
[A service to the fans?
A prime photo opportunity.]

573
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:49,840
Here... here!

574
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:52,720
[Just then...]

[Player Big-nose's one on one chance!]

576

[L plays defense by throwing
his body in the way.]

577
00:35:07,490 --> 00:35:10,940
[Giraffe boy who hasn't had the chance
to pull up his pants yet.]

578
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:24,350
[As soon as he returns from the penalty
box, he incites another brawl.]

579
00:35:25,330 --> 00:35:27,460
[Lets you and I both die!]

580
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:30,650
<i>Both of you in the penalty box.</i>

581
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,930
How many times
are you going to get kicked out?

582
00:35:34,830 --> 00:35:37,730
[Rather than the game itself, deterring
Yong Hwa seems to be his main goal.]

583
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:44,870
Look... look over there at our
tiger caged up in there.

584
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:49,530
<i>Look at our caged up tiger.</i>

585

00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:54,550
- No... no, it's not time yet.
- Look at him. Bite it!

587

Bite it! Bite it!

588
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:06,460
[Black hole Kwang Hee not being of any
help and just being a loud distraction.]

[Jae Suk's awesome pass.]

590
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:13,000
Shoot!

- Your pants!

[But your pants...]

596
00:36:36,490 --> 00:36:38,590

[End of the first half]

599
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:52,650
Somehow... during the game, a whole crowd
of people have come out to watch our game.

600
00:37:00,730 --> 00:37:03,250
You really are a
high maintenance woman!

601
00:37:03,250 --> 00:37:07,330
- You really are a high maintenance woman.
- You say that to each other often.

602
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:10,810
- You really are high maintenance.
- You think I can sit down in this?

603
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:12,580
- Try it.
- How?

604
00:37:13,850 --> 00:37:18,530
- Here, I'll help you down.
- No, I don't have a chair yet!

605

I don't have a chair yet!

606

[Due to the uniform she's in, no
other choice but to lay down to rest.]

607
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:32,360
If we're going to win against that team,
the only choice we have is 'AZ887'.

608
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,990
AZ887...

609
00:37:33,990 --> 00:37:36,760
The AZ887 that my father used
to speak of?

610
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:39,280
Have you ever thought of
becoming a manager?

611
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:43,190
I'm a hockey player.

612
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:48,680
- We can do this. Let's do this together.
- Okay. I know that we can do this together.

to see the drama unfolding before him.]

becoming a backrest for Sulli.]

This looks like an ice hockey drama.

00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:10,100
You guys look like you're shooting a
teen ice hockey drama.

618

[Running Man Team's plan
for the second half is...]

620

[To keep inciting fouls to be
called into the penalty box.]

621
00:38:18,430 --> 00:38:20,620
[Especially Ace Min Ho and Yong Hwa!]

622
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:22,600
You have to get both
Min Ho and Yong Hwa out of there.

623

- This is AZ887.
- AZ887...

624
00:38:24,370 --> 00:38:29,210
How about we get everyone out and
leave Kwang Hee alone with Jong Kook?

625
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:32,150
- That's a great idea.
- That bad, is it?

626
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:36,830
Jong Hyun likes things like this a lot.

naturally abundant curiosity.]

00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:38,980
[A tie with Yong Hwa
for the furthest distance!]

835
00:53:38,980 --> 00:53:43,410
[Idol Team's combined distance total
thus far is 14m 40cm!]

836
00:53:44,170 --> 00:53:47,120
- Kwang Soo!
- Kwang Soo, fighting!

837
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:48,760
[Running Man Team, Kwang Soo's turn.]

838
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:52,870
[Tallest Giraffe, will he jump far?]

839
00:53:52,870 --> 00:53:54,570
You have to jump far, got it?

840
00:54:01,390 --> 00:54:03,210
If you end up falling like that,
you're only going to get 1m!

841
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:08,200
[Is he tumbles head first,
his record will only be 1m...]

842
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:10,810
<i>- That's even scarier.
- What you're doing is scarier.</i>

843
00:54:11,660 --> 00:54:14,410
[Trying to gauge the distance in height
by stretching out his arm.]

844
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:19,170
[It seems as though he left his sanity
back on the ground.]

845
00:54:22,970 --> 00:54:24,580
My stomach hurts.

846
00:54:25,540 --> 00:54:27,630
[Even resorting to prayer?]

847
00:54:28,510 --> 00:54:31,130
This is the only chance you have
to beat Song Joong Ki!

848
00:54:33,820 --> 00:54:39,230
<i>- Five, four, three, two...
- Look out in front of you!</i>

849
00:54:39,230 --> 00:54:43,300
[Oh... the glint in his eye... it's changed.]

850
00:54:43,310 --> 00:54:44,870
<i>- One!
- Let's go! Run!</i>

851
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:49,930
[What... what is there that I can't do!]

852
00:54:53,730 --> 00:54:56,740
[This is nothing!]

853
00:55:13,700 --> 00:55:15,530
[That's far!]

854
00:55:18,510 --> 00:55:21,910
[Awesome! Giraffe!]

855
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:33,650
[Did you think I wouldn't be able to do it?]

856
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:36,150
Come on. Hurry up.

857
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:38,330
Just because you did that,
nothing's changed.

858
00:55:44,830 --> 00:55:46,540
[The best record!]

859
00:55:46,540 --> 00:55:51,090
[No matter, showing us the cool side of
himself for once... Nice, Giraffe!]

860
00:55:51,750 --> 00:55:56,490
<i>With only one jumper left on each team,
I'll show you the combined score so far.</i>

861
00:55:56,500 --> 00:55:58,810
[Combined score for each team thus far.]

862
00:55:58,810 --> 00:56:03,800
[Running Man Team- 24m 40cm.
Idol Team- 23m 10cm.]

863
00:56:04,380 --> 00:56:07,790
[Running Man Team in the lead with
a difference of 1m 30cm.]

864
00:56:08,530 --> 00:56:12,230
[Running Man Team's final jumper,
Kim Jong Kook!]

865
00:56:12,230 --> 00:56:16,090
[And Idol Team's last jumper is Min Ho!]

866
00:56:16,090 --> 00:56:21,230
[The victory of the game once again
rests on these two...]

867
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:25,030
[Even though Running Man Team is ahead by
1m 30cm, they still need to stay on guard.]

868
00:56:25,030 --> 00:56:30,340
[A lot resting on last jumper,
Jong Kook's shoulders!]

869
00:56:30,340 --> 00:56:31,890
- Here I go!
- Fighting!

870
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:43,210
[Let's trust... in my abilities.]

871
00:56:56,170 --> 00:57:00,640
[Even though he submerged after
flying freely into the air...]

872
00:57:04,910 --> 00:57:09,380
[Somehow doesn't seem as though
he got too much of a distance?]

873
00:57:17,390 --> 00:57:19,310
What happened to you?

874
00:57:19,310 --> 00:57:22,680
[The Tiger's record not
meeting the expectations.]

875
00:57:23,210 --> 00:57:27,350
<i>- We needed to get a definite end on them!
- We don't know what's going to happen now.</i>

876
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:35,100
[If Min Ho jumps more than 5m 80cm,
then the Idol Team wins!]

877
00:57:35,100 --> 00:57:36,460
Fighting! Let's rally him on!

878
00:57:36,460 --> 00:57:39,250
[Idol Team giving all their energy
to Min Ho!]

879
00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:47,100
[He lost out to Min Ho during the sleigh
game in the first round, could he really...]

880
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:51,420
[Yelling at one another to
bring down each other's energy.]

881
00:57:52,690 --> 00:57:54,970
[Idol Team's final jumper, Min Ho.]

882
00:57:54,970 --> 00:57:59,110
[If he jumps more than 5m 80cm,
then Idol Team wins!]

883
00:58:00,290 --> 00:58:03,420
[For the first time in a long time,
even Mr. Capable seems nervous!]

884
00:58:05,030 --> 00:58:07,160
<i>Min Ho, you don't have to
work so hard!</i>

885
00:58:09,290 --> 00:58:14,580
Even though we're Running Man,
Min Ho is a dream team all on his own.

886
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:17,480
<i>- Take it easy on yourself!
- Just jump!</i>

887
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:23,980
[Everything about today's competition may
change depending on his one single jump!]

888
00:58:26,540 --> 00:58:30,050
[Jong Kook vs. Min Ho...
who will win this time?]

889
00:58:57,340 --> 00:59:00,570
[He seemed to have jumped quite the
distance, but will it be enough?]

890
00:59:02,540 --> 00:59:07,670
[What will the results show?]

891
00:59:07,670 --> 00:59:08,960
<i>You did good.</i>

892
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:12,670
You're lookin' good, lookin' good!

893
00:59:15,130 --> 00:59:17,330
<i>We've got the results.
We've got the results.</i>

894
00:59:17,330 --> 00:59:18,740
[Time to reveal the combined score results.]

895
00:59:18,740 --> 00:59:22,060
[Did Min Ho flip the game around?]

896
00:59:37,530 --> 00:59:39,780
[By a 20cm difference,
Running Man Team wins!]

897
00:59:40,300 --> 00:59:43,940
[Running Man Team wins the third game,
Ski diving!]

898
00:59:46,110 --> 00:59:48,620
[Min Ho unfortunately lands at 5m 60cm!]

899
00:59:51,970 --> 00:59:55,590
<i>Now... we have one final game left.</i>

900
00:59:55,590 --> 00:59:57,080
[At last, it's the 2013 Running Olympics'
finale competition.]

901
00:59:57,080 --> 01:00:00,320
[Running Man Team: 2, Idol Team: 1]

902
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:03,400
<i>Running Man Team will be given an advantage
at the final location when you arrive.</i>

903
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:07,050
[The final competition that Running Olympic
is known for is now about to start!]

904
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:12,390
[2013 Running Olympic final location-
Incheon Institute of Biology Resources.]

905
01:00:12,390 --> 01:00:14,910
[Just what is the final game that
awaits them here?]

906
01:00:16,410 --> 01:00:18,100
This is attack and defense again.

907
01:00:18,100 --> 01:00:19,650
[This is...]

908
01:00:20,300 --> 01:00:22,040
[The finale to the Olympics is a marathon!]

909
01:00:22,040 --> 01:00:25,370
[Running Olympics finale is an
alternating chase game!]

910
01:00:26,270 --> 01:00:29,450
[The finale for 2012 Summer Running Olympics
was also the alternating chase game!]

911
01:00:29,450 --> 01:00:33,350
[Alternate the sides every 10 minutes!
The ultimate chase where planning is crucial!]

912
01:00:34,470 --> 01:00:37,980
[A special chance to decide whether
they're going to attack or defend first!]

913
01:00:37,980 --> 01:00:40,780
- Let's attack first. That should be good.
- Let's get rid of Min Ho first.

914
01:00:40,780 --> 01:00:42,400
I'm going to oust every one of them.

915
01:00:43,500 --> 01:00:44,940
I'm not going to leave out a single one.

916
01:00:45,830 --> 01:00:48,030
[The attack team must attach a bell
to their shoe.]

917
01:00:48,030 --> 01:00:50,210
You think they'll be
able to beat our know-how?

918
01:00:51,620 --> 01:00:56,930
[Idol Team has no choice
but to go on the defense first.]

919
01:00:56,930 --> 01:01:00,960
[A change in their position every 10 minutes!
When it's announced, must stop their actions!]

920
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:03,290
<i>And from where you are at that moment,
you'll change your position immediately.</i>

921
01:01:03,390 --> 01:01:04,740
Do I look cute?

922
01:01:06,100 --> 01:01:09,140
[How like them as Idols to be worried
about how they look first.]

923
01:01:09,140 --> 01:01:11,840
- Sulli...
- I don't know who to put this on.

924
01:01:12,730 --> 01:01:14,490
One, two, three, fighting!

925
01:01:18,330 --> 01:01:20,920
<i>[Game, start.]</i>

926
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:24,200
[Defense team is given three minutes to hide!]

927
01:01:24,210 --> 01:01:25,410
Where should I go?

928
01:01:27,170 --> 01:01:29,330
- Hide well, kids.
- We're going to get you guys.

929
01:01:29,330 --> 01:01:32,580
Please take good care of us.

930
01:01:32,580 --> 01:01:34,440
- Jong Hyun, hide well.
- Yes.

931
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:36,510
<i>Sulli, hide well, okay?</i>

932
01:01:36,510 --> 01:01:38,500
Kim Jong Kook!

933
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:44,430
[Kwang Hee's laughter
bringing down their morale.]

934
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:49,250
Lee Joon!

935
01:01:49,250 --> 01:01:50,700
Quiet... keep it down!

936
01:01:52,340 --> 01:01:55,790
[Only Joon keeps quiet and hurries along
from having been on Running Man before.]

937
01:01:55,790 --> 01:01:57,830
- Three minutes. we have three minutes.
- I said, keep it down!

938
01:02:00,220 --> 01:02:02,560
- Lee Joon... where do we go?
- Keep it down!

939
01:02:02,560 --> 01:02:04,470
Where... where do we go?

940
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:12,050
[Best chance at survival is to catch as
many as they can during their first attack.]

941
01:02:16,390 --> 01:02:20,600
<i>[10 seconds left before the attack begins.]</i>

942
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:23,320
- Let's go!
- There's no time to waste here.

943
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:26,560
- There's no plan. Just oust them all.
- We need to oust them all unconditionally.

944
01:02:26,570 --> 01:02:29,080
- Oust them as soon as you see one.
- Let's go.

945
01:02:32,120 --> 01:02:34,160
Lee Joon! Where's Lee Joon?
Where did Lee Joon go?

946
01:02:37,090 --> 01:02:40,200
Don't go... don't leave me!

947
01:02:40,200 --> 01:02:42,020
We can't stay together.

948
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:49,320
[The moment that gives most excitement
and anxiousness at the same time.]

949
01:02:55,650 --> 01:02:57,710
[Attack team- On your way!]

950
01:02:59,140 --> 01:03:03,710
[Prepare yourselves!
We will teach you all a lesson!]

951
01:03:05,390 --> 01:03:07,430
- Where do you think they're at?
- Let's try this way.

952
01:03:11,320 --> 01:03:13,850
[The sound of ringing bells...]

953
01:03:23,010 --> 01:03:25,120
[Discovers L from the Idol Team
running away.]

954
01:03:30,850 --> 01:03:33,620
<i>- Jong Kook!
- Up top! He's up top!</i>

955
01:03:33,620 --> 01:03:34,730
[Sound of Running Man team voices
coming from all around him.]

956
01:03:34,730 --> 01:03:37,630
- Jong Kook! It's L!
- There he is! Over there. This way!

957
01:03:37,630 --> 01:03:39,250
This way... this way!

958
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:45,060
[This is the know how!
Block his escape route and ambush him!]

959
01:03:46,020 --> 01:03:48,420
[L makes a desperate attempt to flee!]

960
01:03:48,420 --> 01:03:50,170
<i>Lee Kwang Soo! Get him!</i>

961
01:03:50,170 --> 01:03:52,640
[But... this time,
it's Mr. Capable blocking his way.]

962
01:03:54,060 --> 01:03:56,990
[Completely surrounded within moments!]

963
01:03:59,180 --> 01:04:04,470
[Overly ambitious L didn't even hide
and was lying in wait, and of all places...]

964
01:04:04,470 --> 01:04:06,300
- Five of you against one?
- Sorry. there's no other choice.

965
01:04:06,300 --> 01:04:08,390
- Let's go.
- Next. Let's go find the next one.

966
01:04:08,390 --> 01:04:12,250
[As soon as the chase begins,
one member of the Idol Team is ousted.]

967
01:04:12,830 --> 01:04:17,490
<i>[L - Out!
L - Out!]</i>

968
01:04:19,470 --> 01:04:22,770
<i>L - Out!
L - Out!</i>

969
01:04:24,170 --> 01:04:26,100
Don't you think that was
way too quick?

970
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:31,900
[Searching one room at a time.]

971
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:35,120
<i>- Jong Kook, do you see anyone?
- There's no one.</i>

972
01:04:35,830 --> 01:04:37,170
Please turn the light off.

973
01:04:41,290 --> 01:04:42,580
No, there's no one.

974
01:04:43,030 --> 01:04:45,660
[Wait! Jong Hyun is hiding in that room!]

975
01:04:47,540 --> 01:04:49,370
<i>Did you check out here too?</i>

976
01:04:52,790 --> 01:04:55,000
Ji Hyo!

977
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:58,750
[Running Man know-how. As soon
as you're called, you come running!]

978
01:04:59,970 --> 01:05:01,080
Ji Hyo!

979
01:05:01,080 --> 01:05:05,260
[Mr. Capable and Ace...
Finds Jong Hyun in hiding!]

980
01:05:05,740 --> 01:05:10,660
[Came into the room to hide... Who
knew he'd get cornered like a mouse?]

981
01:05:12,020 --> 01:05:15,350
[Within minutes, already two members
of the Idol Team are ousted!]

982
01:05:15,350 --> 01:05:16,530
I'm really sorry.

983
01:05:16,530 --> 01:05:18,000
[Jong Hyun - Out!]

984
01:05:23,850 --> 01:05:27,940
[Still quite a bit of time left on the clock
until their roles are reversed.]

985
01:05:29,850 --> 01:05:31,230
The sound of that bell is no joke.

986
01:05:31,230 --> 01:05:36,390
[Sound of the bells ringing...]

987
01:05:43,940 --> 01:05:48,820
[If they give out any signs of anyone
being inside, it will mean big trouble!]

988
01:05:48,820 --> 01:05:49,960
<i>- Jong Kook!
- Yeah?</i>

989
01:05:49,970 --> 01:05:52,300
<i>- Do you see anyone?
- I haven't seen anyone. What about you?</i>

990
01:05:53,770 --> 01:05:55,380
<i>I think I'm going to head downstairs.</i>

991
01:05:55,380 --> 01:05:59,590
[Luckily, it seems as though they're
about to just pass by the area...]

992
01:05:59,590 --> 01:06:02,050
[They're leaving... they're leaving.]

993
01:06:07,160 --> 01:06:10,840
- Have you found anyone?
- I just have a feeling someone may be here.

995
01:06:12,070 --> 01:06:13,030
Someone could be hiding in here.

is being suspicious over...]

999

- But no one's in there?
- No, I guess no one's in there.

1000
01:06:32,770 --> 01:06:34,330
I thought someone would be in there.

1001

1002

one of you hiding here, right?

1005

It's just a relief that Jong Kook
hasn't been by yet.

1006
01:07:14,050 --> 01:07:16,110
I would've been dead earlier
if I didn't have this.

1007

to make a roof for himself earlier.]

they're going to know that I'm in here.

1009

- Who is it?
- Ji Suk Jin. Ji Suk Jin!

[Amazing teamwork! Everyone
comes running from Suk Jin's call.]

- Why? What is it?

- I like how we're working together.
- Kwang Hee..

- Honestly, I really do like you.
- Thank you.

1021

- Kwang Hee, there's no other choice.
- Gary, just give me one more chance!

1022
01:08:00,650 --> 01:08:03,580
- No, I really like you too, but...
- Come on, you know how popular I am lately!

1023
01:08:03,580 --> 01:08:06,670
You're popular...
but Suk Jin's popular these days too.

1024
01:08:06,670 --> 01:08:09,530
- Just one more chance... just this once!
- We've got no other choice.

[Amazingly, he thinks to make a deal?]

sooner or later.

- Just give me one chance!
- Seriously...

- Gary, Gary... just one chance!
- We have no other choice. We have to.

- Thanks. You're the best too.

1032
01:08:28,700 --> 01:08:29,950
Got it, got it... we've got Kwang Hee.

- I understand where you're coming from.

1038
01:08:49,270 --> 01:08:51,030
- You do, don't you?
- But I really hate Ha Ha and Gary.

1039
01:08:51,670 --> 01:08:53,990
- I much prefer having you around.
- Right?

1040

Oh, there you are...

1041
01:08:56,850 --> 01:08:59,290
[But I'm too cool to react to that.]

1042
01:09:00,310 --> 01:09:02,930

Otherwise, we're going to get ousted.

01:16:20,490 --> 01:16:22,710
It's time for the exchange soon.
I should get out of here.

1154
01:16:22,920 --> 01:16:24,720
Over here! Min Ho, over here!

1155
01:16:29,780 --> 01:16:32,310
[Discovers Jong Kook
in the corner of the room.]

1156
01:16:33,450 --> 01:16:35,320
- There's not much time left!
- We have to rush!

1157
01:16:35,320 --> 01:16:37,960
[Will they be able to get Mr. Capable
in the time that they have left?]

1158
01:16:43,410 --> 01:16:44,850
I got him. I got him!

1159
01:16:45,110 --> 01:16:47,080
I got him. I got him!

1160
01:16:47,080 --> 01:16:49,850
[Mr. Capable with a tight grasp
on Yong Hwa!]

1161
01:16:49,850 --> 01:16:54,790
[Cease all movement. Time to exchange!]

1162
01:16:56,620 --> 01:16:58,310
Do you know what you call this?

1163
01:16:58,710 --> 01:17:00,830
This is an ant hill attack plan!

1164
01:17:00,830 --> 01:17:03,400
I showed you my face on purpose!

1165
01:17:03,400 --> 01:17:05,810
[This was Mr. Capable's clever plan timed
around the exchange!]

1166
01:17:06,540 --> 01:17:10,450
[Idol Team is now on the defense, and
the Running Man Team is now the attacker!]

1167
01:17:10,450 --> 01:17:12,650
The moment that I saw Ji Hyo's face...

1168
01:17:12,650 --> 01:17:14,890
- I knew I've been caught.
- You knew you were caught...

1169
01:17:16,370 --> 01:17:18,210
As soon as the clock starts up,
run like crazy out of here.

1170
01:17:18,210 --> 01:17:20,940
Yong Hwa... get them, okay?

1171
01:17:21,790 --> 01:17:25,720
- Are you leaving and abandoning me behind?
- You shouldn't exert yourself, Sulli.

1172
01:17:27,750 --> 01:17:29,230
It's my fault again.

1173
01:17:32,620 --> 01:17:35,210
It would be better for you not to move.

1174
01:17:43,420 --> 01:17:45,160
<i>[Cease movement cancelled.]</i>

1175
01:17:51,700 --> 01:17:54,260
[An ant hill hell that he can't escape from!]

1176
01:17:57,930 --> 01:17:59,810
Let's go get Min Ho! Quickly!

1177
01:18:00,390 --> 01:18:02,290
[Yong Hwa - Out!]

1178
01:18:02,290 --> 01:18:04,310
- Where? Where?
- This way! He went this way! Come on!

1179
01:18:13,100 --> 01:18:15,150
- Go that way... go in that way!
- Jong Kook, where are you going?

1180
01:18:18,540 --> 01:18:20,410
[Sound of the bells coming
from all over the place!]

1181
01:18:27,200 --> 01:18:28,680
Where is he in here?

1182
01:18:29,980 --> 01:18:31,670
[Escaping into the showcase room!]

1183
01:18:33,480 --> 01:18:36,590
[The nervousness making his heart
feel like it's about to burst!]

1184
01:18:37,820 --> 01:18:39,850
I saw him run in here.

1185
01:18:39,850 --> 01:18:42,820
Really? Could he be back where
you were hiding earlier?

1186
01:18:51,520 --> 01:18:54,000
[Jong Kook discovers Min Ho!]

1187
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,390
[Jong Kook vs. Min Ho!
Their third face-off of the day!]

1188
01:18:57,320 --> 01:19:01,300
[The unmerciful battle between
Mr. Capable and Ace!]

1189
01:19:04,040 --> 01:19:09,020
[At last, the baby lion's Min Ho's
name tag is eliminated!]

1190
01:19:10,100 --> 01:19:14,650
[Min Ho - Out!]

1191
01:19:20,620 --> 01:19:25,290
<i>[Min Ho - Out!
Min Ho - Out!]</i>

1192
01:19:30,870 --> 01:19:34,900
[The jail getting louder
at Min Ho's entrance.]

1193
01:19:34,910 --> 01:19:36,230
Mr. Capable ripped it off.

1194
01:19:36,880 --> 01:19:40,320
- Seriously...
- He even ripped my clothes.

1195
01:19:40,320 --> 01:19:41,880
[With even the slightest grab,
the sleeves of his shirt is all ripped.]

1196
01:19:41,880 --> 01:19:44,120
[I know that feeling all too well...]

1197
01:19:44,120 --> 01:19:47,410
I was hiding in there...
and they both rushed in there at once.

1198
01:19:47,410 --> 01:19:49,750
Kim Jong Kook has an unbelievable
sense of hunting people down.

1199
01:19:49,750 --> 01:19:52,910
Wasn't your plan to get rid of
Jong Kook right from the beginning?

1200
01:19:52,910 --> 01:19:55,510
- But we couldn't find Jong Kook.
- I know.

1201
01:19:55,510 --> 01:19:58,340
- I bet he went into hiding right away.
- He was probably hanging from the ceiling.

1202
01:19:58,340 --> 01:19:59,750
<i>Hanging from the ceiling...</i>

1203
01:20:03,710 --> 01:20:06,900
- Jong Hyun just keeps laughing.
- Like he's watching TV.

1204
01:20:07,630 --> 01:20:10,970
[Having fun like he's a part of what's
going on in the TV screen.]

1205
01:20:17,270 --> 01:20:20,500
<i>[One minute left until the exchange.]</i>

1206
01:20:21,750 --> 01:20:25,170
Let me come with you.
You too, Ji Hyo.

1207
01:20:25,170 --> 01:20:28,500
- We have to make an ant hill.
- I'm getting really nervous.

1208
01:20:28,510 --> 01:20:31,250
We have to make an ant hill,
so we need to find a good spot.

1209
01:20:31,250 --> 01:20:32,920
[Trying to plan their second
ant hill attack.]

1210
01:20:32,920 --> 01:20:34,940
Someone was hiding in here earlier.

1211
01:20:40,030 --> 01:20:41,920
[At last, it's time to cease
all movement.]

1212
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:48,050
[Running Man to become the defense team
and the Idol Team to become the attack team.]

1213
01:20:48,060 --> 01:20:49,200
Attack!

1214
01:21:00,880 --> 01:21:04,390
<i>[Cease movement cancelled.]</i>

1215
01:21:08,570 --> 01:21:09,920
Joon!

1216
01:21:10,810 --> 01:21:12,210
Joon!

1217
01:21:13,020 --> 01:21:15,030
Yes? Yes, Sulli?

1218
01:21:15,030 --> 01:21:16,550
Over here! Over here!

1219
01:21:18,910 --> 01:21:22,420
I think someone is hiding down here.
But where are the rest of the guys?

1220
01:21:22,420 --> 01:21:25,120
Everyone's all dead. We're the only ones left.
So we have to oust the rest ourselves.

1221
01:21:25,120 --> 01:21:27,570
- They're all dead?
- Yes.

1222
01:21:29,450 --> 01:21:35,770
[Will these two be able to oust Mr. Capable,
Ace Ji Hyo and Haroro all by themselves?]

1223
01:21:35,780 --> 01:21:38,620
- If we find them...
- We have to figure out what to do.

1224
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:43,160
When I looked earlier, there were
a lot of secret rooms around here.

1225
01:21:47,460 --> 01:21:49,360
Rooms like this one...

1226
01:21:49,360 --> 01:21:51,220
There are a lot of rooms like
this around here.

1227
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:54,020
Hello.

1228
01:21:54,020 --> 01:21:56,410
There are a lot of rooms like this here...
hello.

1229
01:21:57,120 --> 01:22:00,040
[All three of them in the same place?]

1230
01:22:00,040 --> 01:22:03,720
[Is this the second ant hill hell
that they spoke of?]

1231
01:22:03,720 --> 01:22:05,770
- We've been waiting for you.
- Sulli...

1232
01:22:06,480 --> 01:22:08,870
Sulli... what do we do?

1233
01:22:08,870 --> 01:22:12,850
[Is this really the face of the defense team?]

1234
01:22:12,850 --> 01:22:14,460
- What is this?
- We've been waiting for you.

1235
01:22:15,150 --> 01:22:16,990
- Come here.
- Where have you been?

1236
01:22:16,990 --> 01:22:21,650
[The attack team is undeniably the Idol
Team. Sulli makes her way forward!]

1237
01:22:21,650 --> 01:22:23,370
Hey! What are you doing?

1238
01:22:24,130 --> 01:22:27,450
[Running Man Team covers each other's
name tag with their hands to protect it!]

1239
01:22:28,860 --> 01:22:31,760
[Absolutely impossible for Lee Joon
to approach using his strength alone!]

1240
01:22:32,680 --> 01:22:35,860
[Sulli's attack vs. Ji Hyo's defense
over Ha Ha's name tag!]

1241
01:22:45,070 --> 01:22:49,550
[Sulli rids Ha Ha of his name tag!]

1242
01:22:52,260 --> 01:22:56,020
[Sulli doesn't stop and moves on to
attack Ace Ji Hyo!]

1243
01:22:56,020 --> 01:22:58,520
- Don't step on me!
- Sorry.. sorry!

1244
01:22:59,010 --> 01:23:02,530
[What is he being subjected to?]

1245
01:23:04,700 --> 01:23:07,780
[Sulli now starts attacking Mr. Capable!]

1246
01:23:09,050 --> 01:23:11,800
[Ace Ji Hyo blocks her path
with her own body!]

1247
01:23:12,810 --> 01:23:14,840
[The bloodiest battle in the
history of Running Man!]

1248
01:23:14,840 --> 01:23:17,130
[Absolute chaos!]

1249
01:23:18,010 --> 01:23:20,340
Joon! Hurry up and rip it off!

1250
01:23:20,340 --> 01:23:22,880
I wish I could... but I have no hands!

1251
01:23:23,730 --> 01:23:24,950
My hands...

1252
01:23:25,480 --> 01:23:26,560
Look at this!

1253
01:23:31,610 --> 01:23:33,830
Don't stab me with your chin!

1254
01:23:35,490 --> 01:23:36,940
Ji Hyo, I'm sorry.

1255
01:23:37,580 --> 01:23:41,460
I'm sorry.
[One minute to the exchange.]

1256
01:23:43,280 --> 01:23:46,490
- Jong Kook...
- We... lost to you guys the last time.

1257

[Running Man Team trying to get revenge
for having lost at the last Running Olympics.]

1258
01:23:53,350 --> 01:23:54,740
I really want to win.

1259
01:23:54,740 --> 01:23:57,120
The Idol Team won the last time.

1260
01:23:57,120 --> 01:24:01,160
The Idol Team won the last time, Sulli.
It's our turn.

[Mr. Capable shutting the door
and locking them up inside?]

1262

<i>[Cease all movement.]</i>

1270
01:24:36,620 --> 01:24:38,280
I had no other choice.

1271
01:24:38,280 --> 01:24:40,580
There was no other choice if
our team is to win.

1272
01:24:40,580 --> 01:24:42,220
Ji Hyo, I'm really sorry.

1273
01:24:45,710 --> 01:24:48,480
- Ji Hyo...
- You locked me in there so you could live?

1274
01:24:48,480 --> 01:24:50,380
Ji Hyo, it was for the sake of our team.

1275
01:24:50,390 --> 01:24:53,330
- We have to win...
- Did you think...

1276
01:24:53,330 --> 01:24:55,890
- That I'd survive in there once you left?
- You did really well though.

1277
01:24:55,890 --> 01:25:00,300
But there was only 30 seconds left,
and I knew I had to get out of there.

1278
01:25:01,010 --> 01:25:02,370
You'd better win.

1279
01:25:02,380 --> 01:25:05,250
And... Sulli's really strong.

1280
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:09,320

Joon... it was just you and Sulli?

It's just Sulli and Jong Kook.

1298
01:26:32,990 --> 01:26:36,470
- How did you last so long?
- I was surprised myself.

1299

I think... I think I'm good at this.

1300
01:26:42,410 --> 01:26:47,120

face to face at last.]

How were you planning on coming after me
later on when you get tired so easily?

1313
01:27:25,430 --> 01:27:28,870
I don't know why I tried to escape.
I'm the attacker, so I don't know why.

I'm really sorry. Seriously...

1315
01:27:31,210 --> 01:27:33,470
[Little lady Sulli... just what
is the fate that awaits her?]

1316
01:27:35,060 --> 01:27:36,910
<i>- Who do you think won?
- I'm really curious!</i>

1317
01:27:36,910 --> 01:27:38,860
- I'm really curious.
- I think this is the prize.

1318
01:27:38,860 --> 01:27:41,930
[Prize box for the winning team.]

1319
01:27:42,980 --> 01:27:46,900
[Tiger vs. the Lamb...
the end results are yet unknown.]

1320
01:27:47,640 --> 01:27:49,590
Defense...
Jong Kook is wearing the defense hat.

1321
01:27:55,030 --> 01:27:56,790
- What is this?
- Is this a joke?

1322
01:27:56,790 --> 01:27:59,380
[What? Sulli's name tag is off too?]

1323
01:27:59,380 --> 01:28:02,640
The next time I come on the show,
Jong Kook said he'd be my servant.

1324
01:28:02,640 --> 01:28:04,270
What are you talking about?
What do you mean, servant?

1325
01:28:04,280 --> 01:28:07,360
- You promised!
- I didn't say servant. I just said I'd help.

1326
01:28:07,360 --> 01:28:09,020
We won!

1327
01:28:09,520 --> 01:28:11,430
[How did this happen?]

1328
01:28:11,430 --> 01:28:15,650
I'll just say that I'll owe you one for this,
and let's just make a clean break...

1329
01:28:15,650 --> 01:28:19,450
The next time you come on the show,
no matter what happens... for you...

1330
01:28:19,460 --> 01:28:21,160
- I will serve you.
- Really?

1331
01:28:21,160 --> 01:28:24,330
- I'm being serious.
- You'll be my servant?

1332
01:28:24,340 --> 01:28:27,530
- You're going to be my slave?
- Seriously... slave isn't the right term.

1333
01:28:27,530 --> 01:28:30,020
For the whole show,
I will do whatever I can for you.

1334
01:28:30,020 --> 01:28:32,690
- For the year?
- Not the year!

1335
01:28:33,870 --> 01:28:36,920
[After making her the promise...]

1336
01:28:39,510 --> 01:28:42,870
[After eliminating Sulli's name tag,
Running Man Team wins!]

1337
01:28:42,870 --> 01:28:47,000
[Time to reveal the prize
to the winning team.]

1338
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:48,670
<i>At the count of three,
please open the prize box.</i>

1339
01:28:48,670 --> 01:28:53,480
[It was a gold medal at the last Olympics,
what would it be this time?]

1340
01:28:53,480 --> 01:28:55,220
Why is it so light?

1341
01:28:56,380 --> 01:28:57,930
- What is this?
- What...

1342
01:28:57,930 --> 01:28:59,660
- Wait...
- Is it gold?

1343
01:28:59,660 --> 01:29:01,510
- No, it's not.
- What is this?

1344
01:29:01,520 --> 01:29:05,820
[The winning prize:
Not gold medals, gold colored name tags.]

1345
01:29:05,820 --> 01:29:09,160
[Still a long ways to go before
the gold prizes are brought back.]

1346
01:29:09,170 --> 01:29:10,990
- We won.
- Yay, we won.

1347
01:29:16,510 --> 01:29:20,050
[Jong Hyun in TV watching mode.]

1348
01:29:21,790 --> 01:29:24,060
The next time I'm on the show,
I'm going to eliminate you first.

1349
01:29:24,060 --> 01:29:26,010
- Really?
- What a joke. What a joke!

1350
01:29:26,010 --> 01:29:28,010
You have to go through us first.

1351
01:29:29,210 --> 01:29:31,400
Running Man, yeah!
