[Comrades Lee and Ji at a full sprint.]

168
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:00,000
Let's go in.

169
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:07,360
[Place where their mission is to take place.
City Hall.]

170
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:21,500
[But this place...]

171
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:26,170
[As if time has slipped backwards
80 years into the past...]

172
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:29,350
[Everywhere they look are people dressed
in clothing from the past era.]

173
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:32,730
[A place where the time stopped flowing.]

174
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:36,500
[City hall as it was back in 1938.]

175
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:44,430
[Even the games that they're playing are
games from the past era.]

176
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:46,690
I'm the last king of Joseon.

177
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:48,600
- You're a King?
- You look like you're a student.

178
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:51,240
[What game are you two playing?]

179
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,330
This is 1938...

180
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:55,280
Even though I can't believe it...

181
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,180
How could something like this
have happened?

182
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:00,130
[In a place where the time stopped flowing...]

183
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:05,190
[You must carry out your mission.]

184
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:09,910
[This is how all the seven couriers
came to gather in the same place.]

185
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:14,730
<i>I must find the Mayor's office.</i>

186
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:20,650
The gold treasure chest
is in the Mayor's office?

187
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:21,810
[Comrade Blank checking her paper
once more time.]

188
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:25,920
<i>Check the treasure chest that's being kept
in the Mayor's office at the city hall.</i>

189
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:29,010
Mayor's office...

190
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:37,650
[This is none other than the
Mayor's office!]

191
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:44,300
[Deep inside that office...]

192
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:53,640
[The treasure chest!]

193
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:57,000
[The courier's mission...]

194
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,100
[Open up the treasure chest and
take over all the gold bars!]

195
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:02,430
[But the number of keys that are needed...]
[There are a total of seven!]

196
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,960
[Now that he's verified the chest,
time to search for the keys!]

197
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:10,260
[ The location of the keys...]
Where can I find the keys?

198
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:13,070
- What are you searching for?
- Nothing!

199
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:16,940
[Comrade Jae Suk having come to the
Mayor's office to verify the treasure chest.]

200
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:18,440
This is by the country's orders.

201
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:23,180
- What are you looking for?
- Nothing!

202
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:24,380
It's nothing!

203
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:29,220
[In order to open up the treasure chest...]

204
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:31,160
[Number of keys needed are seven.]

205
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,770
Then it means that all of us
needs to find our keys?

206
00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:36,050
[In that case...]

207
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:40,400
Does it mean that one person needs to steal
all those keys and open up this chest?

208
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,670
Look here, Comrade Gae!

209
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,670
Why are you saying those words out loud
when you should be whispering it to yourself?

210
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:52,350
- Who is it?
- A lion is headed this way.

211
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:55,330
- A lion.
- Welcome.

212
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:59,810
Kim Doo Hwan...
Kim Doo Hwan, what are you doing here?

213
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:04,310
[Possessed by the spirit of
Kim Doo Hwan.]

214
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:06,340
- You got a fedora...
- What did you say?

215
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:07,740
You came wearing a fedora.

216
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:10,000
Who are you supposed to be?

217
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,730
I was just farming on my land...
I was just farming when I got conscripted.

218
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:19,360
Don't you think he's here for the
unification of our country?

219
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,900
- What are you?
- Comrade Kkuk...

220
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,290
Is this the treasure chest?

221
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:26,410
- There are seven of them.
- Then we each need to find one?

222
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:28,300
- There are seven locks.
- There are seven locks?

223
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:33,470
[Each of the courier knows the location
of where their one key is hidden.]

224
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:37,250
[All those seven keys must be in possession
in order to open up the treasure chest.]

225
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:42,300
[Couriers heads out to find the keys.]

226
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:49,780
[Gary's key hidden away in
the press room.]

227
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:57,230
[Jong Kook's key is on the
balcony somewhere.]

228
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,690
[Jae Suk's key is by the window...]

229
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:08,230
All three of the traitors have
gathered together in one place.

230
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:10,610
Let's seriously win together!

231
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:13,330
What is it?

232
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:16,410
- I saw it first! It's mine!
- It's mine, you traitors!

233
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:18,090
- It's mine!
- Wait!

234
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:21,280
We can have it...
we can share it amongst ourselves.

235
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:23,400
As long as we throw our greed aside...

236
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,220
- What is this?
- I think we need keys for these locks.

237
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:26,640
They're all locked.

238
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:28,600
- How many locks are there?
- There are seven of them.

239
00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:31,480
Need all the keys to open it.

240
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:34,440
Let's stay hidden here and take the keys
from the people that walk in here.

241
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:37,020
Once we oust them, don't you think their
keys will undoubtedly become ours?

242
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:38,720
[Plotting their ruse instead of
searching for their keys.]

243
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,830
- Let's fight them!
- Do you want to do it or not?

244
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:42,680
[Before even five seconds go by,
the group erupts into an argument.]

245
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:45,330
Let's all stay together until only
the three of us are left. Please!

246
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:47,440
- Let the three of us be the last survivors.
- Yes, seriously.

247
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,640
- Yes, seriously. No going back!
- No betrayals either!

248
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,810
[Bad habit of his hand going into action
whenever he sees an opportunity.]

249
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:56,110
[This is the traitor's DNA.]

250
00:14:57,990 --> 00:15:01,020
[If they keep this up, they won't even find
any of their keys and fail the mission.]

251
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:03,900
- We'll all let go on the count of three.
- One, two, three!

252
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,890
[Doubt anyone will let go...]

253
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,430
Where's the press room?

254
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:20,930
[But that woman is...]

255
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:29,120
[A woman of mystery catching the eye
of Comrade Gae.]

256
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:48,210
[A woman of marrying age
bumping into Comrade Gae.]

257
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:49,410
What did you do that for?

258
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:53,530
- I dropped all my papers.
- I'm so sorry!

259
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:55,890
This is my first time here.

260
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:01,600
- Are you okay?
- Yes, I'm fine. Thank you.

261
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,280
It seems as though you like
'Jingle Bells'?

262
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:08,380
- You're totally my style.
- I am?

263
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:15,480
[Disappears after making her comment?]

264
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:19,070
Wait! You can't...
You can't just leave like that!

265
00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:21,770
[Huh?]

266
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:26,970
[Could 'Jingle Bells' be
another clue of some kind?]

267
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:29,810
Why... why did she bump into
my shoulder?

268
00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:31,170
Just why would she do that?

269
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:34,670
<i>What is this?</i>

270
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:36,900
[A place where people are curiously
tossing their balls around.]

271
00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:39,200
[Something feels suspicious...]

272
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,990
What's everyone doing?

273
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,250
What is this?

274
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,100
What are you guys doing?
What are you doing?

275
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:52,860
[Huh? The balls they've been playing with
are thrown towards Comrade Kkuk?]

276
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:56,160
[A sudden frontal assault?]

277
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:02,440
What are you people...

278
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:04,840
<i>What is this?</i>

279
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:06,680
<i>Why are they throwing their
balls at me?</i>

280
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:10,230
There's nothing here.

281
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:18,360
This is extremely important!
They're coming! Run!

282
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:22,340
What is this?

283
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:29,140
[The moment he's handed the bundle,
he gets chased after by a mob!]

284
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:32,060
- Catch him!
- What the heck?

285
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:35,470
What's going on?

286
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:37,860
What? What? What is it?

287
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:39,910
What? What is it?

288
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:45,540
Press release? Wait...

289
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:47,890
[Comrade Gae discovers a press release.]

290
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:57,270
What's going on?

291
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:58,910
- Gary!
- What's going on?

292
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:00,180
Why? What's going on?

293
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:03,500
[If he doesn't hand over the bundle,
they just might chase him back to 2013!]

294
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:15,900
[Could the key be inside that pouch?]

295
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:24,490
[The key is inside the pouch!]

296
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:29,850
[Comrade Gae finds his key!]

297
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:40,700
[Barely succeeds at getting away
with the bundle.]

298
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:42,050
What is this?

299
00:18:42,050 --> 00:18:44,430
[What's wrapped up in that bundle?]

300
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:46,880
Just what is inside this bundle?

301
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:50,800
[Just a pillow?]

302
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:54,800
<i>There's nothing in here...</i>

303
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:06,860
[All he can manage from the shock
is an empty laugh...]

304
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:09,260
- It's nothing?
- It's nothing.

305
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:11,800
- Why were they after you if it's nothing?
- Why are you standing there watching me?

306
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:14,120
- Why are you...
- I was watching out of curiosity.

307
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:18,280
[Comrade Gae with a hardened expression
after having found his key.]

308
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:20,890
<i>Everyone... let's do this!</i>

309
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:23,760
[Blank Ji quickly noticing his
hardened expression.]

310
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:24,960
What are you doing?

311
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:28,440
That mere scrap of paper...

312
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,810
Wait! You can't take that from me!

313
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:34,890
[Scanning the contents within moments.]

314
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:37,850
Wait... the important part...

315
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:42,370
You didn't get to see the
important part yet!

316
00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:45,560
[Getting rid of the evidence.]

317
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,600
Spit it out!

318
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,890
Spit it out!
I said, spit it out!

319
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,740
I said, spit it out!

320
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:52,920
[Wait, something...]

321
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,970
[He dropped his key!]

322
00:19:58,720 --> 00:19:59,850
Ji Hyo!

323
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:01,970
[Emergency situation.]

324
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:05,980
[To so simply lose the key
he worked so hard to find...]

325
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:09,780
It's not time for this yet!

326
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:12,070
[Comrade Blank handing his key
back over to him for now...]

327
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:14,500
[ Why did it fall out so easily?]

328
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:18,000
I can't believe this fell out like that.
Ji Hyo, it's not time for all that yet.

329
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:21,140
You really are so clumsy.

330
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:24,700
Even back in 1938,
Kang Gary was this clumsy!

331
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,680
What is this?

332
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:30,350
What are all these neon signs
doing in this little room?

333
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:32,030
Is this a dance place or something?

334
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:35,710
- Just pretend you never saw it.
- Okay.

335
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:39,790
But in exchange,
you have to make me a promise.

336
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:40,990
What is that?

337
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,150
If I get into any trouble...

338
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:46,490
- You have to help me.
- I will help you out unconditionally.

339
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:47,560
Okay.

340
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:51,570
[Due to his clumsy keeping of the key,
Blank and Gae coalition is born.]

341
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:57,540
[Comrade Ha's key that's said to be
hidden near the copier.]

342
00:20:57,540 --> 00:21:01,090
Here is a copier...

343
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:04,340
How am I to look for it in here?

344
00:21:06,410 --> 00:21:08,440
Where could it be?

345
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:15,490
I found it right away.
Here it is...

346
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:19,360
Here it is.

347
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,970
[Comrade Ha finds his key.]

348
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:27,600
[In an attempt to confuse others,
he puts the pouch back in its place.]

349
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,320
I found it.

350
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:35,260
What? What is it?
Why are you guys moving?

351
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:38,570
[All the people are suddenly...]

352
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:42,630
What's going on?
Why are they all acting like this?

353
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:46,430
What is this? A musical?

354
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:50,680
What? What are you all doing?

355
00:21:57,230 --> 00:21:58,690
Why are you all acting like this?

356
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:03,640
[People from the Joseon era just
keep on dancing without any response.]

357
00:22:09,330 --> 00:22:12,600
[Disperses as soon as Gary arrives?]

358
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:19,010
[Unable to recognize him right away,
Ha Ha finally discovers Mr. Gae in the midst.]

359
00:22:19,010 --> 00:22:21,620
- I didn't know what was going on.
- I didn't either.

360
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:24,260
- Did you find your key yet?
- No, I just got here.

361
00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:29,150
I think that's the prettiest outfit I've
ever seen you wear on Running Man.

362
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,820
It suits you perfectly.

363
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:34,940
[Detective Jae Suk searching every
possible window sill that he runs across.]

364
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:46,680
[After checking his surroundings first.]

365
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:50,330
[The silk pouch!]

366
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:55,500
[Detective Jae Suk also finds his key!]

367
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:02,160
[Now that he's got his key
in his hands...]

368
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:04,550
[Next is...]

369
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:07,970
This is really important!
[Huh?]

370
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:10,340
Wait! I don't want it!
I don't want to take it!

371
00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:14,100
[False bundle that keeps being
handed to him every chance possible.]

372
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:15,480
I don't want it!

373
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:16,700
I said, I didn't want it!

374
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:22,090
[On the run again with all his might!]

375
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,920
I don't have anything!
Just leave!

376
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,150
What's going on?

377
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:30,450
<i>Just leave!</i>

378
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:34,720
[As even that happens whenever he
runs into the bundle carrying man...]

379
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:37,970
<i>- What's wrong?
- What's going on?</i>

380
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:40,230
I wonder what's going on.

381
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:44,050
Why... why did he insist giving it to me
when I said I didn't want it?

382
00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:45,730
- The bundle?
- Yeah!

383
00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:47,440
Where did it happen?

384
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:49,790
On the first floor.

385
00:23:52,150 --> 00:23:54,900
Why does he insisting on giving it to me
even when I tell him I don't want it?

386
00:23:54,910 --> 00:23:59,490
[Now that we think back,
the bundle is only given to Jae Suk...]

387
00:23:59,490 --> 00:24:00,640
<i>It's something you need.</i>

388
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,680
[He said it was an item he needed...]

389
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,750
[But all that happened was
he got chased after by the mob...]

390
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:05,430
[But...]

391
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:07,340
[If by any chance all these events...]

392
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:09,290
[Weren't just a coincidence?]

393
00:24:09,290 --> 00:24:11,960
[What if 'You' of the past was
'Me' in the present?]

394
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,800
Why are all these people here?

395
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,420
[Kwang Soo in search of his key.]

396
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:19,680
[Why are all these people...]

397
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:21,560
Hello.

398
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,530
I'm the King of the Joseon era.

399
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:27,390
Will everyone please stop
their movements?

400
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:32,880
<i>Man Soo, it's so nice to see you!</i>

401
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:36,030
<i>Oh my, I'm sorry.</i>

402
00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:40,510
What is this?

403
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:43,780
Is there something going on?

404
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:48,990
[Hint to finding the key, Azerbaijan.
Seems as though he doesn't know the country.]

405
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:50,620
<i>Hyun Kook!</i>

406
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,680
<i>Oh... I'm sorry.</i>

407
00:24:57,930 --> 00:24:59,280
What is this?

408
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,210
Why are they all behaving like this?
Who are they mistaking me for?

409
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:03,400
Who is Hyun Kook?

410
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:06,500
- What the heck?
- Cha Dol!

411
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:11,090
[Being condemned everywhere he goes.]

412
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:14,610
[What are these events
happening to the Giraffe...]

413
00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:15,650
Hey!

414
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:18,490
This is strange.

415
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:23,960
[An area full of all dapperly dressed men.]

416
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,230
What are you doing?
Why are you being like this?

417
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:33,280
What's going on?
Why are you being like this with me?

418
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:36,430
[Is Comrade Blank being
forcefully detained?]

419
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,830
[Kneeling down before her?]

420
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:42,750
<i>Please accept me!</i>

421
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:50,230
<i>Please accept me!</i>

422
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:53,820
[A sudden love confession?]

423
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:01,070
[Comrade Gae suddenly butting in.]

424
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:05,490
[Unbelievable...]

425
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:14,930
<i>Hug him!
Hug him!</i>

426
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:34,330
Love triangles existed even
back in 1938?

427
00:26:34,890 --> 00:26:37,400
- Don't you think this is a bit too harsh?
- What's too harsh?

428
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,210
[Same coupling even 80 years ago...]

429
00:26:39,210 --> 00:26:41,760
Who are you to take my
lady away from me?

430
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,170
- Hey, let's go!
- Let's go!

431
00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:45,340
Who are you?

432
00:26:46,970 --> 00:26:50,310
You chased away all my suitors who
were about to confess their love for me!

433
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:51,740
I don't want you seeing them.

434
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:53,660
- They're not much to look at.
- Seriously!

435
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:55,460
A man knows other men best.

436
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:57,040
Don't see any of them.

437
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,820
If you date a man like that,
it'll just make things difficult for you.

438
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:01,330
What difficulties are there?
You're the high maintenance one!

439
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,820
All he did was give you some flowers.

440
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:06,700
What do you mean,
just give me some flowers?

441
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:11,490
- When these flowers are full of fragrance.
- Why would you even need any flowers?

442
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:13,520
When you're more beautiful
than any flower already.

443
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:18,270
Anyway, Kang Gary...
you weren't any different in 1938, I see.

444
00:27:21,530 --> 00:27:26,230
[But anyways... what's going on now?]

445
00:27:28,910 --> 00:27:30,830
[Detective Yoo with
the key in his possession.]

446
00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:34,550
What... what are you going around doing?

447
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,180
[Discovers a fascinating object.]

448
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:37,610
What is that? A dog?

449
00:27:47,150 --> 00:27:50,440
Where did you get that thing to be
pulling it around with you everywhere?

450
00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:51,800
Huh?

451
00:27:56,130 --> 00:27:57,700
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

452
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:59,810
- Why do you all keep...
- Why do they keep hitting you?

453
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:02,320
- What's that?
- What is that?

454
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,300
[All the comrades gathering around
the fascinating camera device.]

455
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:07,740
What is that?

456
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:09,630
It's a camera. What else could it be?

457
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:22,640
- What is that?
- Hey, that thing is expensive.

458
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:25,680
[Unable to take his eyes away...]

459
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,330
Kwang Soo, strike a pose.

460
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:28,920
[Immersing himself in posing
for the camera.]

461
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:29,950
<i>Very cool.</i>

462
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:34,380
What are you doing?

463
00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:37,610
- What are you doing?
- What do you think you're doing?

464
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:41,740
This is what this camera is
used to shoot.

465
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:43,230
How would you know that?

466
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:46,260
- It's used to take back shots.
- Is it really?

467
00:28:56,290 --> 00:29:00,550
[Seeing how they're all so at ease,
does it mean they've all found their key?]

468
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:05,390
[All seven keys have to be together...]
[To be able to open up the treasure chest.]

469
00:29:05,390 --> 00:29:06,670
<i>I told you, I haven't found it yet.</i>

470
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:09,740
[Everyone should have found
their key by now.]

471
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:11,990
- As of now...
- You keep talking quite a bit.

472
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,870
- Wait...
- You're acting very suspicious.

473
00:29:13,870 --> 00:29:14,960
What are you doing?

474
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,770
- Are we starting now then?
- Let's get started.

475
00:29:16,770 --> 00:29:18,660
- Okay, let's do it then.
- Let's do it!

476
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:21,880
Are the five of you
working together right now?

477
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,670
Why don't we all go our separate ways for now?

478
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:26,790
[Comrade Kkuk sensing that
something is up.]

479
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:28,300
You have to make up your
mind right now.

480
00:29:28,930 --> 00:29:31,630
[Which team will Comrade Yoo join?]

481
00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:33,910
- One!
- Okay.

482
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:35,750
- Let's go.
- Let's get him!

483
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:37,880
[Targeting Comrade Kkuk first
for being the strongest?]

484
00:29:37,890 --> 00:29:40,130
- This isn't going to be easy.
- You were being the loudest!

485
00:29:40,130 --> 00:29:42,420
- Wait...
- You were being the loudest!

486
00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:49,920
[Comrade Yoo goes after the Giraffe?]

487
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,160
It wasn't me. I didn't do it.

488
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,350
It really wasn't me.

489
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:58,550
[Comrade Giraffe fails the mission!]

490
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:03,160
[A sudden ambush that
he hadn't even fathomed.]

491
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,860
- Kwang Soo!
- Don't let him know anything.

492
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:08,870
[Is Comrade Giraffe's mission
over this simply?]

493
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:13,120
[Everyone still remaining confrontational.]

494
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,940
So this is why people are always
telling me to watch out for Yoo Jae Suk?

495
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:16,380
- The key!
- The key...

496
00:30:16,770 --> 00:30:19,170
[Comrade Yoo now with two keys.]

497
00:30:19,170 --> 00:30:22,200
- Wow... he has two keys now?
- So it means everyone has their keys.

498
00:30:27,770 --> 00:30:31,510
<i>I have to oust Kim Jong Kook somehow.
Kim Jong Kook... he won't even budge.</i>

499
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:37,060
It's him again!
It's that man again!

500
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:39,460
[The man with the bundle again!]

501
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:42,750
Why that man... seriously, what the heck?

502
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:43,900
Why are you doing this to me?

503
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:45,600
You're going to need this.
I'm for real this time!

504
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,090
[Desperately passing off the bundle
every time he sees him.]

505
00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:49,490
Yes, I understand.

506
00:30:57,650 --> 00:30:59,370
I'm seriously about to go crazy.

507
00:31:01,170 --> 00:31:02,720
<i>What are you afraid of?</i>

508
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:05,110
- What's that bundle for?
- There he is!

509
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:10,590
- It's already on its way up.
- Suk Jin... second floor... third floor!

510
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:14,740
[A life on the run with the bundle.]

511
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,410
[Where did he go?]

512
00:31:20,770 --> 00:31:21,930
Gary...

513
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:24,390
- What are you doing here?
- Gary!

514
00:31:25,010 --> 00:31:26,520
[Blank-Gae coalition in hiding.]

515
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:29,110
- I think Jae Suk went in there.
- With his bundle?

516
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:32,930
<i>Hey! There he is!
Jae Suk!</i>

517
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:34,570
<i>What is that?</i>

518
00:31:34,570 --> 00:31:37,100
[The group breaks out in their dance
as soon as Ha Ha arrives.]

519
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:38,410
Over at the end!

520
00:31:41,990 --> 00:31:44,360
[Comrade Yoo backed up into a corner.]

521
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:45,850
- Listen to me.
- What's in that bundle?

522
00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:47,700
- What is it?
- What's in there?

523
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:48,870
Hurry up and open it.

524
00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:50,720
- Quickly.
- Show us what it is.

525
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:54,640
- Then I'll... show you what this secret is.
- Yes, show us the secret.

526
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:56,840
- Tell us.
- Inside this...

527
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:01,340
- There's money in this bundle.
- Money?

528
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:02,390
Let me see it then.

529
00:32:03,570 --> 00:32:07,380
[If they catch him in his lie,
then he's going to get ousted...]

530
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:09,340
- Why don't we talk about this?
- I'm sorry.

531
00:32:15,130 --> 00:32:17,750
[Uses the moment Comrade Ji
has his guard down to eliminate him!]

532
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:19,130
You don't all need to see this, do you?

533
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:23,500
Gary, this is why... this is why...

534
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:26,500
[Comrade Big-nose having been deceived
and eliminated within a flash of a moment.]

535
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:28,250
We don't all need to see this.

536
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:35,300
[This is Comrade Yoo's killer instinct.]

537
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:39,400
- Are you really...
- Wow, you're really scary!

538
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:42,400
- Go stand away from me.
- No, I'm not like that!

539
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:46,180
[Two people are already...]

540
00:32:47,390 --> 00:32:48,620
[I have to survive no matter what
to complete my mission.]

541
00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:52,460
[Gains Comrade Ji's key.]

542
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:54,750
[A total of three keys!]

543
00:32:56,290 --> 00:33:00,630
[If he can get the remaining four keys...]

544
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:06,760
[Okay...]

545
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:09,850
This means Jae Suk now has three keys.

546
00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:16,190
Oh my goodness!

547
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:20,280
[Discovers the Tiger lying in wait.]

548
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:25,190
- You really startled me!
- Why?

549
00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:27,390
- Do you know that Jae Suk is no joke?
- Why? What's he doing?

550
00:33:27,390 --> 00:33:30,950
Suk Jin... Jae Suk totally tricked him
and ousted Suk Jin.

551
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:34,120
<i>Jong Kook...
please take care of Jae Suk.</i>

552
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:35,790
<i>- Okay.
- He's in there.</i>

553
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:37,020
<i>I know.</i>

554
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:39,760
[Come to me... Comrade Yoo.]

555
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:51,560
[What? He's headed into the room
Jong Kook is in?]

556
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:53,920
[You came...]

557
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:58,770
[Just what...]

558
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:05,810
[Even though he tried to turn
after luring him in...]

559
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,130
You've got some nice skills.

560
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:11,400
[He's congratulating him on
eliminating two people?]

561
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:13,960
It was just a rare chance.

562
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:17,960
You have to... know to recognize the
chance within a split second.

563
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,840
You're frightening.

564
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:22,290
[Who is he calling frightening?]

565
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,640
What else can I do if I don't want
to be the one getting ousted?

566
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:26,680
I guess you're right.

567
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:27,890
Very cool.

568
00:34:27,890 --> 00:34:30,390
[Gauging each other out.]

569
00:34:34,950 --> 00:34:38,080
I've never once beat Kim Jong Kook
when we're the only two sole survivors.

570
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:42,110
[In that case...]

571
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:44,680
[Is right now the chance?]

572
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:50,140
[Is he about to eliminate
Comrade Kkuk right now?]

573
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:56,430
[Now... now's the chance!]

574
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:12,560
[I've been had...]

575
00:35:14,610 --> 00:35:16,670
[He was eyeing Comrade Yoo
the same way.]

576
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:22,770
How can this be?

577
00:35:24,010 --> 00:35:26,920
You were just about to oust me, right?
That's why you followed me?

578
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:29,130
I had a feeling you would,
so that's why I was hiding back there.

579
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:31,020
[So he noticed...]

580
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,120
Darn!

581
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:37,440
Why you! I'm not going
to let you get away with it!

582
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:40,240
- Kim Jong Kook!
- Ultimately, people don't change.

583
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:41,960
[He really is Mr. Capable.]

584
00:35:42,690 --> 00:35:44,310
<i>The keys.</i>

585
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:47,150
- Why don't you hand them over?
- Having to give him all three keys...

586
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:49,360
[Transferring all three keys into
Jong Kook's possession.]

587
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:51,690
I can't believe I've been
deceived like that.

588
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:55,130
I can't believe I've been
betrayed like this.

589
00:35:55,690 --> 00:36:00,130
[When I've eliminated two of the
comrades with my own two hands...]

590
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:18,770
What is this?

591
00:36:18,770 --> 00:36:20,120
Single cells?

592
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:22,610
[Solitary prison confinement?]

593
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:28,280
[That's right! All the eliminated comrades
are being kept confined in solitary cells!]

594
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:31,450
But... why aren't they announcing
who's been ousted today?

595
00:36:31,450 --> 00:36:34,000
Right? They haven't announced me.
They haven't announced anything.

596
00:36:34,850 --> 00:36:37,750
I usually feel some comfort when I hear the
announcement of who's been ousted

597
00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:40,300
because I know that things are slowly
starting to come to an end, but...

598
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:41,970
do I have to keep staying here?

599
00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:44,400
It's going to be a long day.

600
00:36:45,530 --> 00:36:47,870
Why is the jail so small?

601
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:50,190
This isn't the proper amenity for jail.

602
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:53,330
<i>Everyone is being confined in
a solitary cell today.</i>

603
00:36:53,330 --> 00:36:54,710
Solitary cells?

604
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:57,790
What wrong have I committed
to bear such a heavy price like this?

605
00:36:58,530 --> 00:37:02,900
[Will they... all stay in
solitary confinement like this?]

606
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:04,710
This really is too much.

607
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:08,700
Ah! Yoo Jae Suk...

608
00:37:10,810 --> 00:37:13,790
What have I done that's so awful to
have to be in solitary confinement?

609
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:18,800
Shouldn't I at least know who's been
ousted so that I can...

610
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:24,750
[Tiger out on full strike mode since there
are only a few survivors left remaining.]

611
00:37:25,370 --> 00:37:27,050
[Comrade Capable on the chase!]

612
00:37:31,690 --> 00:37:33,330
[Real action.]

613
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:38,120
- Hurry!
- Hey!

614
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:40,180
[Stop right there!]

615
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:45,600
[This right here...
is Mr. Capable's real image!]

616
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:52,850
[The Tiger showing his claws...]

617
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:57,200
[Comrade Ha earns himself a
solitary prison confinement.]

618
00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:04,030
[Absolute exhaustion.]

619
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:09,780
[Only people remaining now are,
Tiger vs. Black and Gae coalition.]

620
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:12,300
What should I do?
I'd hate to tear you two apart.

621
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:16,530
[Solid Blank and Gae coalition.]

622
00:38:17,090 --> 00:38:18,580
It really would be the end for us.

623
00:38:18,870 --> 00:38:22,400
- That's right! It's totally obvious!
- Who's betraying whom right now?

624
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:25,640
Ji Hyo, you want to oust me then?

625
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:29,550
And hey, it will be Ace versus Ace!

626
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,140
[Does he call that a proposition?]

627
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:35,370
[Just then!]

628
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:38,410
[Comrade Kkuk comes after Comrade Gae!]

629
00:38:39,430 --> 00:38:42,110
[Blank and Gae coalition
trying to work together.]

630
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:45,940
[Ji Hyo's in danger!]

631
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:52,050
[Comrade Blank's name tag!]

632
00:38:53,830 --> 00:38:56,500
[Forcefully thwarts his moves,
and counterattacks!]

633
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:04,540
[Ultimately, even
Comrade Blank is eliminated.]

634
00:39:06,090 --> 00:39:07,950
What am I supposed to do on my own
without you now?

635
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:09,360
Good luck.

636
00:39:09,830 --> 00:39:11,130
Good luck with what?

637
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:13,200
I'll see you in a minute.

638
00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:17,040
Hey, Ji Hyo!
I'll see you in 32 seconds.

639
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,460
[Comrade Kkuk vs. Comrade Gae.]

640
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:26,710
I really would like to win for once.

641
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:29,350
[Just who will get all seven keys and
get to open the treasure chest?]

642
00:39:29,350 --> 00:39:30,570
Please don't be like this!

643
00:39:39,370 --> 00:39:43,140
[Ultimate power house, Mr. Capable,
Comrade Kkuk!]

644
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,370
[And a man who's end we
can never predict.]

645
00:39:47,370 --> 00:39:51,140
[Random Mr. Capable, Comrade Gae.]

646
00:39:52,170 --> 00:39:54,100
[A real battle between these two.]

647
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:00,550
[Gary grabs his at the same time!]

648
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:03,110
[The keys are mine!]

649
00:40:05,450 --> 00:40:09,260
[The battle between these two...]

650
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:14,740
[Who will get to open up the
treasure chest?]

651
00:40:16,050 --> 00:40:18,120
It's not a situation to get involved in.

652
00:40:18,590 --> 00:40:20,530
But what else can I do?

653
00:40:22,690 --> 00:40:25,290
[Just who...]

654
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:29,430
[January 27, 1938 - The final battle.]

655
00:40:30,890 --> 00:40:35,480
[A short while later.]

656
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:38,250
[The treasure chest was opened.]

657
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:41,310
- The recording is over.
- What?

658
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:43,160
You're now free to go.

659
00:40:43,790 --> 00:40:46,650
What in the world is going on?
Why isn't anything getting announced?

660
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,930
- We'll let you go.
- To where?

661
00:40:48,930 --> 00:40:50,290
I'm just free to leave?

662
00:40:50,290 --> 00:40:53,200
What is this? We're to just leave
without anyone telling us the results?

663
00:40:53,550 --> 00:40:55,150
Really?

664
00:40:55,710 --> 00:40:57,990
Kim Jong Kook, you're dead!

665
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:05,310
[The treasure chest being opened...]

666
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:11,290
[But... there's nothing in there?]

667
00:41:13,670 --> 00:41:17,280
[January 27, 1938]

668
00:41:17,290 --> 00:41:20,530
[The seven comrades that were gathered
together at the city hall.]

669
00:41:20,530 --> 00:41:23,760
[In the end, they weren't able to
successfully carry out their mission.]

670
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:26,710
[And...]

671
00:41:26,710 --> 00:41:32,560
[The tumultuous years pass on by.]

672
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:50,210
[January 27, 2013 - Seoul City Hall.]

673
00:41:52,830 --> 00:41:57,890
[The stepping stones that connect
the past to the present.]

674
00:42:21,570 --> 00:42:23,740
<i>You've been reincarnated.</i>

675
00:42:26,590 --> 00:42:30,610
[From 1938 to 2013.]

676
00:42:30,610 --> 00:42:32,260
I've been reincarnated?

677
00:42:34,610 --> 00:42:36,650
<i>You've been reincarnated.</i>

678
00:42:37,730 --> 00:42:40,010
Why would I be reincarnated when
I haven't even died?

679
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,540
Why would I be reincarnated when
I've never been dead?

680
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:45,390
<i>It is now the year 2013.</i>

681
00:42:45,390 --> 00:42:48,200
[Reincarnated comrades who've traveled
80 years in time.]

682
00:42:50,090 --> 00:42:52,960
[An old chest and a picture that's
placed in front of them?]

683
00:42:57,240 --> 00:43:00,830
<i>[A treasure chest that was discovered
at the city hall in 1938.]</i>

684
00:43:01,090 --> 00:43:04,170
<i>[Even though there's evidence the chest was
opened with the use of the seven keys]</i>

685
00:43:04,170 --> 00:43:06,950
<i>[none of the contents were found inside.]</i>

686
00:43:07,010 --> 00:43:11,000
<i>[Also, none of the seven keys
were ever discovered from the site.]</i>

687
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:18,220
[Even though the final man standing used the
seven keys to open up the treasure chest...]

688
00:43:18,230 --> 00:43:21,490
[The treasure chest was found empty!]

689
00:43:25,050 --> 00:43:29,320
<i>[Two chests were originally produced in an
effort to thwart any attempts of theft.]</i>

690
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:31,860
<i>[But the whereabouts of one of
the chests are unknown.]</i>

691
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:34,830
Then does it mean that the real
treasure chest is somewhere else?

692
00:43:34,830 --> 00:43:38,730
[Then does it mean that the real
treasure chest is still elsewhere?]

693
00:43:38,730 --> 00:43:40,270
Oh my God!

694
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:46,390
[The treasure chest that was opened was
a decoy used to thwart theft attempts!]

695
00:43:46,870 --> 00:43:50,740
<i>Seven couriers were sent by different...
isn't that us?</i>

696
00:43:51,110 --> 00:43:56,270
<i>The final member of the seven couriers
had all seven keys right up to the end.</i>

697
00:43:58,270 --> 00:44:00,600
Are you asking us to find out
who that last person was?

698
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:06,810
[The final man standing from 1938 has
the seven keys to the real treasure chest!]

699
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:10,920
So that's why you kept us
locked up in our rooms?

700
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:12,670
So that we can't find out the results?

701
00:44:12,670 --> 00:44:15,480
So that we can't know who ended up
with all the keys?

702
00:44:16,270 --> 00:44:17,870
Seriously...

703
00:44:17,870 --> 00:44:21,560
I wonder who has the seven keys?

704
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:27,870
[Ji Hyo knows that the final two survivors
were Gary and Jong Kook.]

705
00:44:27,870 --> 00:44:29,780
It's either this man or this man.

706
00:44:31,250 --> 00:44:34,070
This man really looks just like the picture.

707
00:44:36,330 --> 00:44:43,970
[The last two survivors, Mr. Capable and Gary
facing their final battle in 1938.]

708
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:54,750
[Just who is the last man standing
that has possession of all seven keys?]

709
00:44:57,630 --> 00:45:00,330
Okay... what does this mean?

710
00:45:01,290 --> 00:45:03,650
[Unable to comprehend.]

711
00:45:04,490 --> 00:45:07,140
If you can give me some information
a day before the recording...

712
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:10,590
If you'll give me some information separately,
I'll study it and come better prepared.

713
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:14,250
Don't you think that I'm left too much
out in the dark with this situation?

714
00:45:14,580 --> 00:45:16,560
Who was ousted after me?

715
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:18,260
I don't know anything.

716
00:45:19,580 --> 00:45:23,290
<i>Your present mission is to start figuring out
what it is that happened back then.</i>

717
00:45:23,290 --> 00:45:26,020
[Who was the person that opened up
the treasure chest in the past...]

718
00:45:26,020 --> 00:45:31,020
[Also where's the real treasure chest?]

719
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:38,580
- Jae Suk.
- Suk Jin.

720
00:45:38,580 --> 00:45:41,610
- Suk Jin...
- Hey, who ousted you?

721
00:45:41,860 --> 00:45:44,780
- I was betrayed by Kim Jong Kook.
- Really?

722
00:45:45,090 --> 00:45:47,060
Our mission is to find out who
that last person was, right?

723
00:45:47,060 --> 00:45:49,620
- Yeah, we have to find that person.
- Then we need to work together.

724
00:45:49,620 --> 00:45:53,580
- It's most likely that it was Kim Jong Kook.
- It was either Kim Jong Kook or Kang Gary.

725
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:56,150
- Gary really is...
- He's a random Mr. Capable.

726
00:45:56,150 --> 00:45:59,700
For some reason, he's really strong and
pulls through in the end.

727
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:01,190
[Could it be random Mr. Capable,
Gary who pulled it off in the end?]

728
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:03,720
It was Ha Ha and then Kwang Soo, right?

729
00:46:03,990 --> 00:46:06,290
- After Ha Ha, it was... there's Jong Kook.
- Where?

730
00:46:07,650 --> 00:46:12,080
[Just then the likely suspect
Jong Kook makes his appearance!]

731
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:14,630
- Guys... where are you going?
- Wait...

732
00:46:15,700 --> 00:46:16,810
Jae Suk!

733
00:46:16,810 --> 00:46:19,920
- You traitor.
- Jae Suk, if I was the last person...

734
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:22,840
If I was the last person, why would I be
going around looking for you guys?

735
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:24,190
- Be quiet, you traitor.
- Jae Suk!

736
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:27,580
Jae Suk, if you think I have the keys,
shouldn't you be attacking me?

737
00:46:27,580 --> 00:46:29,760
- What did you say?
- If I had the seven keys...

738
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:32,710
It's because it's still too dangerous. There
needs to be at least three people for you!

739
00:46:32,710 --> 00:46:34,670
- Jae Suk, come here.
- Why?

740
00:46:34,670 --> 00:46:36,890
Guys, it's not me. Guys!

741
00:46:36,890 --> 00:46:39,550
- Let's just see each other later.
- I'm telling you, it's not me!

742
00:46:39,550 --> 00:46:41,900
- I know it was you!
- It was Gary!

743
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:43,410
You're lying!

744
00:46:43,410 --> 00:46:45,000
Seriously... what a liar!

745
00:46:45,980 --> 00:46:51,160
[Mr. Capable insisting it wasn't himself...
was he the final man left standing?]

746
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:55,220
If I'm to oust Kang Gary early on...

747
00:46:55,230 --> 00:46:59,480
then other people are going to be convinced
that I was the one and come after me.

748
00:47:00,380 --> 00:47:02,780
Even if I don't oust Kang Gary...

749
00:47:02,780 --> 00:47:04,680
[Just then!]

750
00:47:06,950 --> 00:47:08,350
You startled me.

751
00:47:09,180 --> 00:47:11,530
This is really urgent.
This is extremely important!

752
00:47:11,530 --> 00:47:13,550
Make sure not to get it taken away!
Hurry up and escape. Hurry!

753
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:16,380
<i>What are you doing?
Why are you doing this?</i>

754
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:20,090
[A mob of men dressed in black
are chasing after Jong Kook!]

755
00:47:22,180 --> 00:47:23,410
What are they doing?

756
00:47:23,410 --> 00:47:24,580
What's going on?

757
00:47:24,580 --> 00:47:28,290
[Without even knowing what's going on,
he's getting chased with the case in hand!]

758
00:47:28,870 --> 00:47:31,320
<i>What the heck?
There's nothing even in here!</i>

759
00:47:32,220 --> 00:47:35,310
[An empty case? Just what in the world...]

760
00:47:35,660 --> 00:47:37,910
There's nothing in the case!

761
00:47:38,470 --> 00:47:40,530
There's nothing in the case!

762
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:43,450
I was totally fooled.
Totally fooled.

763
00:47:44,780 --> 00:47:46,620
Just what in the world is going on?

764
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:50,980
Wait, now that I think about it, earlier...

765
00:47:50,980 --> 00:47:54,470
[Now that he thinks about it, this scene...]

766
00:47:54,470 --> 00:47:56,820
Back in the past... the bundle!

767
00:48:03,530 --> 00:48:06,410
[1938]

768
00:48:07,540 --> 00:48:11,260
[Now that we look back,
the same thing happened to Jae Suk!]

769
00:48:11,260 --> 00:48:16,060
[There was a mob of men chasing after
the bundle back then too...]

770
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:17,840
<i>What is this bundle?</i>

771
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:19,670
[Mr. Capable having witnessed
this scene in hiding.]

772
00:48:20,370 --> 00:48:26,000
[Yeah... this is similar to what happened
in the previous life!]

773
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:31,810
Earlier, there was a mob of guys who
were chasing after Jae Suk with the bundle.

774
00:48:32,690 --> 00:48:38,160
[Past and the present- A similar situation...
What's the connection here?]

775
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:40,920
[On the other hand.]

776
00:48:43,370 --> 00:48:47,430
[The other suspect, Gary who is
loitering around the hallways.]

777
00:48:49,730 --> 00:48:53,020
- What's this? What are you doing here?
- Hey, Gary.

778
00:48:53,330 --> 00:48:55,680
- I was giving myself a foot massage.
- You were giving yourself a foot massage?

779
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:56,950
[The two elders getting their
feet massaged.]

780
00:48:56,950 --> 00:48:59,000
- You... it was you, right?
- What?

781
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,490
- It was you, right?
- Back in 1938.

782
00:49:00,490 --> 00:49:02,430
- What about 1938?
- The winner.

783
00:49:02,430 --> 00:49:05,590
- Say something that makes some sense!
- I don't think it was Gary either.

784
00:49:05,590 --> 00:49:07,650
- How could I be the winner?
- Suk Jin, it's not Gary.

785
00:49:07,650 --> 00:49:10,580
- Jong Kook said it was you.
- What are you talking about?

786
00:49:10,580 --> 00:49:13,270
- Kim Jong Kook said it was you.
- Why would you fall for that?

787
00:49:13,270 --> 00:49:15,080
He and I were the last two left...

788
00:49:15,590 --> 00:49:18,320
But his claws are
fully out of his paws right now.

789
00:49:18,910 --> 00:49:21,340
If his claws are out too,
on top of his build...

790
00:49:21,340 --> 00:49:22,670
To be honest, he's just way too scary.

791
00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:26,990
I ran with everything I had
back in the city hall...

792
00:49:26,990 --> 00:49:30,760
but Jong Kook was barely running
when he caught up to me.

793
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:33,420
And all he did was just barely nudge me
when I fell over like a little deer.

794
00:49:33,430 --> 00:49:35,430
Your story of what happened
is very detailed.

795
00:49:35,430 --> 00:49:37,970
[A very detailed relay of what happened
to earn both their trusts.]

796
00:49:37,970 --> 00:49:39,280
I can see him doing that.

797
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:41,330
- I don't think he's lying. It's too detailed.
- He's not lying.

798
00:49:41,330 --> 00:49:43,470
This is what Jong Kook said to me
as his lips turned white...

799
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:46,050
<i>"I'm going to maintain my
character today."</i>

800
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:50,470
- That mental... wow...
- You have to believe me.

801
00:49:50,470 --> 00:49:54,080
I don't think the three of us will be enough.
We need to get Kwang Soo and Ha Ha too.

802
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:56,650
- Come on. Let's go.
- We need Kwang Soo at least.

803
00:49:56,650 --> 00:49:57,840
- Yeah, we need him.
- Let's go.

804
00:49:58,420 --> 00:50:01,720
What Gary said at the end about Jong Kook
saying he wants to maintain his character...

805
00:50:02,690 --> 00:50:07,670
[Encounters Giraffe who doesn't know
anything that's going on.]

806
00:50:07,670 --> 00:50:08,790
- We're so glad we ran into you.
- We were looking for you.

807
00:50:08,790 --> 00:50:10,490
- Kwang Soo...
- I'm sure you all know...

808
00:50:10,490 --> 00:50:13,320
- That I'm not the one with the keys.
- No, you don't have them.

809
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:14,990
[Of course, you don't...]

810
00:50:14,990 --> 00:50:17,800
Kwang Soo, it's Jong Kook.
Kim Jong Kook.

811
00:50:17,810 --> 00:50:20,600
- Jong Kook is the winner.
- I was the other last survivor earlier.

812
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:22,540
Kim Jong Kook won.

813
00:50:22,540 --> 00:50:24,440
<i>Should we start from the top and
work our way down one by one?</i>

814
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:26,170
<i>Yeah, that's what we should do.
In order, one by one.</i>

815
00:50:26,170 --> 00:50:29,940
[Is Ace Ji Hyo about to join the group
to thwart Mr. Capable?]

816
00:50:29,940 --> 00:50:31,310
You're asking who ousted me?

817
00:50:31,310 --> 00:50:32,850
- Did Kim Jong Kook oust you?
- Yes.

818
00:50:32,850 --> 00:50:35,740
I remember! I remember
what happened 80 years ago!

819
00:50:35,740 --> 00:50:38,410
- You remember, don't you?
- Kang Gary was standing next to me.

820
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:41,070
And Kim Jong Kook was there too.

821
00:50:41,070 --> 00:50:44,530
- We were all going back and forth...
- We kept going around in circles.

822
00:50:45,020 --> 00:50:47,140
And then I grabbed Kim Jong Kook
by the collar around his throat.

823
00:50:47,140 --> 00:50:49,000
And then Jong Kook ripped off
my name tag.

824
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:53,320
Then you don't know for sure if it was Gary
or Jong Kook who survived to the end either?

825
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:56,360
Right, but think about it carefully.
Who do you think survived?

826
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:58,420
- It was Kim Jong Kook!
- That's an obvious question.

827
00:50:58,420 --> 00:51:00,590
<i>Also, Jae Suk...</i>

828
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:03,870
[On the other hand]

829
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:07,540
[A Tiger in hiding!]

830
00:51:09,390 --> 00:51:10,530
Jong Kook!

831
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:13,600
Why are you after me?

832
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:16,750
Jong Kook... are you wearing spandex?

833
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,610
Jong Kook... what is this?

834
00:51:23,620 --> 00:51:25,160
- I'm really sorry.
- Why? What?

835
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:26,910
- There's just no other way.
- Why me all of a sudden?

836
00:51:26,910 --> 00:51:28,850
You're all going to band together to
oust me anyways, aren't you?

837
00:51:28,850 --> 00:51:31,590
- No, we're not!
- I didn't win in the past life.

838
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:35,430
- Then who did?
- Someone did. Someone else won.

839
00:51:35,430 --> 00:51:38,310
[He's saying it wasn't him?]

840
00:51:38,310 --> 00:51:43,110
[Everyone's saying that it wasn't them.
Then just who was the real winner?]

841
00:51:44,310 --> 00:51:45,610
When I saw Jong Kook earlier...

842
00:51:45,610 --> 00:51:48,120
I noticed that his hand was wrapped up
in a bandage. I will grab onto that pinky.

843
00:51:48,530 --> 00:51:50,230
I'll bend that pinky backwards.

844
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:53,810
If you do that...
you could end up dying today.

845
00:51:53,810 --> 00:51:57,080
- First...
- No one can escape, okay?

846
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:59,870
- Suk Jin, no running way.
- Let's not run away.

847
00:51:59,870 --> 00:52:01,150
Ji Hyo...

848
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:03,420
- That's not my style.
- Jae Suk...

849
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:05,190
You're most likely to do that.

850
00:52:05,190 --> 00:52:07,560
- Look at this!
- Look here.

851
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:10,780
- Look at the giraffes!
- 'Are there five like-minded people?'

852
00:52:11,590 --> 00:52:14,770
- That's us! That's us!
- Over here! Let's join hands!

853
00:52:14,770 --> 00:52:17,860
- 'Are there five like-minded people'?
- That's totally us!

854
00:52:17,860 --> 00:52:20,150
[Five giraffes in the poster!]

855
00:52:20,150 --> 00:52:22,270
- Let's go.
- I suddenly feel very courageous.

856
00:52:22,270 --> 00:52:23,940
- Let's go!
- Let's go.

857
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:26,410
[Five against one!
Is the heaven on their side?]

858
00:52:26,410 --> 00:52:29,730
Let's just face him straight on.
Let's not back down from him.

859
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:34,580
- Come here.
- Jae Suk!

860
00:52:34,580 --> 00:52:37,130
I just saw Jong Kook.
Make sure you don't run into him!

861
00:52:37,130 --> 00:52:39,030
- Why?
- He's running around in a spandex shirt.

862
00:52:39,030 --> 00:52:40,370
Seriously?

863
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:41,950
He said he's going to kill anyone
who crosses his path.

864
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:43,430
You have to make sure not to
cross his path.

865
00:52:43,430 --> 00:52:47,340
What the heck is this?
Is this a game or what?

866
00:52:47,340 --> 00:52:49,620
[Yoo-ruce Willis is talking
a big game for now...]

867
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:53,410
It looks as though he just painted black
war paint all over his body.

868
00:52:53,410 --> 00:52:57,230
[100% real! Bloodier atmosphere
than any other time!]

869
00:52:57,230 --> 00:52:58,360
Why are you trying to scare us?

870
00:52:58,360 --> 00:53:00,880
I'm not just trying to scare you.
See for yourself. You'll be shocked.

871
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:03,400
He's listening to us somewhere right now.
I felt it down to my bones.

872
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:05,500
He's crouched down like this.
All you can see are his eyes.

873
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:08,580
- He's listening to us?
- I can just see him hiding somewhere...

874
00:53:08,580 --> 00:53:11,270
I actually really like Jong Kook.

875
00:53:12,790 --> 00:53:14,890
- What did you say?
- Who here doesn't like Jong Kook?

876
00:53:14,890 --> 00:53:18,290
- I really respect him.
- What's with you guys?

877
00:53:22,100 --> 00:53:29,430
[That's right... I'm listening to everything.]

878
00:53:30,340 --> 00:53:32,250
Just who does Kim Jong Kook
think he is?

879
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:33,680
He's Kim Jong Kook.

880
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:35,390
Just who does Kim Jong Kook think he is...

881
00:53:36,570 --> 00:53:39,190
[They're coming...]

882
00:53:40,940 --> 00:53:43,020
He's hiding out somewhere.

883
00:53:49,700 --> 00:53:52,020
[Wild Tiger's ambush attack!]

884
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:53,590
How scary!

885
00:53:57,890 --> 00:54:01,500
[Harrowing hunting scene that
they witnessed for themselves!]

886
00:54:02,170 --> 00:54:04,920
Seriously, Kim Jong Kook!

887
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:12,940
[Underneath Jae Suk's name tag is
the name, Ji Suk Jin?]

888
00:54:12,940 --> 00:54:17,880
[Just what does that mean?]

889
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:19,560
- Why does it say Ji Suk Jin?
- I seriously have no idea!

890
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:21,700
- What is this?
- I don't know!

891
00:54:21,710 --> 00:54:23,620
Why is my name on your back?

892
00:54:23,620 --> 00:54:25,820
- What is this?
- I don't know!

893
00:54:25,820 --> 00:54:27,430
- Let's not overreact.
- It's not me!

894
00:54:27,430 --> 00:54:29,580
- Without a doubt, one of you...
- Don't listen to him! Just get him!

895
00:54:29,580 --> 00:54:33,650
- The seven keys... the keys!
- We have to do it now. Now's our chance!

896
00:54:33,660 --> 00:54:35,410
I'm not the one who has the keys!

897
00:54:35,410 --> 00:54:37,550
- We have to go. We have to get him.
- Come on!

898
00:54:40,300 --> 00:54:43,010
[If they don't get him now,
they may never get Mr. Capable!]

899
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:47,920
- We can't lose him now!
- Get him!

900
00:54:51,510 --> 00:54:54,210
[Stop in their tracks out of fear
in the midst of chasing after him.]

901
00:54:54,210 --> 00:54:55,930
We all have to go after him together
for this to work.

902
00:54:56,910 --> 00:55:01,120
This is so frustrating.
In my previous life and present life...

903
00:55:01,120 --> 00:55:03,110
Ah... seriously!

904
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:06,110
- What do you think of what's on your back?
- Why does it say Ji Suk Jin?

905
00:55:06,110 --> 00:55:07,700
<i>Why don't you try to figure it out?</i>

906
00:55:07,790 --> 00:55:10,140
So whenever a name tag is ripped off,
it shows the person that they ousted?

907
00:55:11,220 --> 00:55:12,940
It's not that?

908
00:55:13,020 --> 00:55:14,680
Then what could it be?

909
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:19,230
Tell me if you're going to tell me.
I'm mad enough as is already!

910
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:22,970
Seriously... I'm about to lose my mind.

911
00:55:22,980 --> 00:55:26,230
Why do things like this always
happen to me in the final battle?

912
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:29,450
<i>If you can guess what it means by the
time you arrive in jail, we'll let you live.</i>

913
00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:37,120
Ji Suk Jin?

914
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:42,400
<i>I don't think this is going to work.
Let's just get going.</i>

915
00:55:42,620 --> 00:55:44,360
You really are insulting me.

916
00:55:45,830 --> 00:55:48,430
- He's way too scary.
- But why is my name on Jae Suk's back?

917
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:51,780
Wait, I think we need to figure out
what that means first.

918
00:55:51,780 --> 00:55:55,480
If we rip off someone else's name tag,
maybe we'll figure out what it means.

919
00:55:55,480 --> 00:55:58,630
- Jae Suk...
- Suk Jin, who ousted you earlier?

920
00:55:58,630 --> 00:55:59,760
Jae Suk.

921
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:02,260
No, that's not it. That can't be it.

922
00:56:02,260 --> 00:56:08,210
[Even with all five of their heads together,
they still can't figure it out.]

923
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:12,750
[Wait...]

924
00:56:13,860 --> 00:56:16,200
<i>You've been reincarnated.</i>

925
00:56:18,430 --> 00:56:21,970
[They were undoubtedly told early
that they've been reincarnated.]

926
00:56:24,170 --> 00:56:27,610
[Could it be connected with
how they've been reincarnated?]

927
00:56:27,610 --> 00:56:29,460
Reincarnated...

928
00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:32,960
The names are in white with
a black name tag background, right?

929
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:34,420
Hey...

930
00:56:34,420 --> 00:56:43,750
[Now that they think back,
the name tags look awfully familiar...]

931
00:56:46,090 --> 00:56:48,630
[1938]

932
00:56:49,890 --> 00:56:53,800
[The name tag...]

933
00:56:55,470 --> 00:56:57,560
The name is in white against
a black background.

934
00:56:58,130 --> 00:57:01,000
Doesn't it means that Suk Jin has been
reincarnated in Jae Suk's body?

935
00:57:02,890 --> 00:57:05,080
- Then isn't Suk Jin really Jae Suk?
- Jae Suk is me!

936
00:57:05,080 --> 00:57:07,340
Didn't Suk Jin get reincarnated
as Jae Suk?

937
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:09,750
Ah! Reincarnation!

938
00:57:10,110 --> 00:57:15,600
[That's right! They've been
reincarnated as someone else!]

939
00:57:19,110 --> 00:57:22,440
[1938]

940
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:24,690
<i>Yoo Jae Suk, you...</i>

941
00:57:24,690 --> 00:57:28,740
[Big-nosed Brother crossing the
stepping bridge out of 1938.]

942
00:57:32,740 --> 00:57:39,960
[Ji Suk Jin... He's been
reincarnated as Yoo Jae Suk.]

943
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:44,670
[This is the secret behind reincarnation.]

944
00:57:47,670 --> 00:57:51,810
<i>You've been reincarnated.</i>

945
00:57:53,590 --> 00:57:55,120
Jae Suk is me!

946
00:57:55,120 --> 00:57:58,610
[Jae Suk of 2013 is Suk Jin of 1938!]

947
00:57:58,610 --> 00:58:00,450
We've been reincarnated as
someone else!

948
00:58:00,970 --> 00:58:03,490
I'm someone else,
so the real me is someone else!

949
00:58:03,490 --> 00:58:07,720
The person who had the keys 80 years
ago isn't the same person anymore

950
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:08,810
but it's someone else!

951
00:58:08,810 --> 00:58:12,030
The name of the person who won 80 years
ago is stuck on someone else's back!

952
00:58:12,030 --> 00:58:14,040
That's right! People can
be reincarnated as dogs too!

953
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:17,160
Then Jong Kook can be any one
of us right now!

954
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:21,750
[Then who did the suspect Jong Kook
be reincarnated as?]

955
00:58:21,750 --> 00:58:23,430
Then we don't know which one of us
could be Jong Kook right now.

956
00:58:23,430 --> 00:58:24,760
For example...

957
00:58:26,820 --> 00:58:29,070
- Jong Kook is one of us...
- Wait.

958
00:58:29,070 --> 00:58:31,750
Then even in the present,
I'm still the race starter?

959
00:58:32,170 --> 00:58:37,610
[Bingo! Since Jae Suk is Suk Jin's
reincarnation and the first to get ousted.]

960
00:58:37,610 --> 00:58:40,970
[The constant race starter.]

961
00:58:40,970 --> 00:58:42,600
This is really strange.

962
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:46,920
Seriously though...
Jong Kook won 80 years ago, right?

963
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:48,840
- Right?
- That's what our belief is right now.

964
00:58:48,840 --> 00:58:50,680
- Right?
- But that could be wrong too.

965
00:58:50,680 --> 00:58:52,350
What do you mean,
it could not be?

966
00:58:52,350 --> 00:58:54,940
No, that would make no sense.
Someone else is on Kim Jong Kook's back.

967
00:58:54,940 --> 00:58:58,020
It could be any one of you.
Kim Jong Kook is amongst us right now.

968
00:58:58,020 --> 00:59:03,270
What's happening now...
is somehow connected to 80 years ago.

969
00:59:03,270 --> 00:59:05,010
Then we've all been reincarnated right now?

970
00:59:05,010 --> 00:59:09,400
This isn't just a coincidence.
It's all connected somehow.

971
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:13,870
There's something else other than the
past and the present being connected somehow.

972
00:59:13,870 --> 00:59:20,160
[They must find out who the winner from
80 years ago has been reincarnated as!]

973
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:22,430
- We have to find the treasure chest anyways.
- You're right.

974
00:59:22,430 --> 00:59:23,680
Okay. Let's look around.

975
00:59:29,170 --> 00:59:32,950
[Tiger in shock himself from the sudden
attack that he sprang.]

976
00:59:35,500 --> 00:59:37,180
But...

977
00:59:37,180 --> 00:59:40,490
When I ripped off Jae Suk's name tag
earlier, it said Ji Suk Jin underneath it.

978
00:59:41,100 --> 00:59:42,230
But crazy enough...

979
00:59:42,630 --> 00:59:48,490
the incident from the previous life where
Jae Suk was given the bundle happened to me.

980
00:59:48,810 --> 00:59:52,780
In my opinion, on my back...
Yoo Jae Suk's name is stuck on it.

981
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:57,260
[If that's the case...]

982
00:59:59,050 --> 01:00:00,690
Let's search around.

983
01:00:08,170 --> 01:00:11,500
- Chul Soo!
- Oh my gosh.

984
01:00:12,750 --> 01:00:15,520
- I'm sorry.
- What's this? What's going on?

985
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:17,330
- I know this person.
- Who did this happen to?

986
01:00:17,810 --> 01:00:21,430
- Why did that person hit me?
- Who had this happen in their previous life?

987
01:00:22,180 --> 01:00:24,840
- Who did this happen to?
- This happened in the previous life, right?

988
01:00:24,850 --> 01:00:26,790
- Who was it?
- Who did this happen to?

989
01:00:26,790 --> 01:00:28,650
[The person who was battered by strangers
just to have them apologize in the past?]

990
01:00:31,510 --> 01:00:32,840
- I'm sorry.
- Oh my goodness!

991
01:00:32,840 --> 01:00:35,560
- Who did this happen to in the past?
- Which one had this happen to them?

992
01:00:35,570 --> 01:00:39,450
[The person who was unjustly beaten
up like this in the past life...]

993
01:00:40,300 --> 01:00:42,470
[1938]

994
01:00:44,810 --> 01:00:47,030
<i>Chul Soo, it's great to see you!</i>

995
01:00:47,900 --> 01:00:49,350
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

996
01:00:49,350 --> 01:00:50,560
<i>Hyun Kook!</i>

997
01:00:51,780 --> 01:00:53,240
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

998
01:00:54,770 --> 01:00:56,670
<i>Cha Dol!</i>

999
01:00:57,840 --> 01:01:02,340
[The person who was beaten up all day...]

1000
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:06,540
<i>Who's the one that had this
happen to them in their past life?</i>

1001
01:01:08,940 --> 01:01:10,870
Who had this happen to them?
Did this happen to you in your past life?

1002
01:01:10,870 --> 01:01:13,130
- No.
- It didn't happen to you?

1003
01:01:13,570 --> 01:01:20,290
[Giraffe from the past life...
has been reincarnated as Impala.]

1004
01:01:21,460 --> 01:01:24,200
[Isn't anything going to happen?]

1005
01:01:27,970 --> 01:01:31,530
[Huh? Who are all these people?]

1006
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:33,690
What are you doing?

1007
01:01:34,450 --> 01:01:36,820
[After being dragged
into middle of the room...]

1008
01:01:36,820 --> 01:01:39,890
[Huh?]

1009
01:01:39,890 --> 01:01:45,390
[Wait! This is... this is...]

1010
01:01:48,270 --> 01:01:51,820
<i>Accept him!
Accept him!</i>

1011
01:01:51,820 --> 01:01:58,230
[A public proposal that Ji Hyo
received in her previous life?]

1012
01:01:59,960 --> 01:02:02,790
[No way!]

1013
01:02:02,790 --> 01:02:05,430
Will you please accept my love?

1014
01:02:06,390 --> 01:02:09,410
[This situation somehow...]

1015
01:02:09,410 --> 01:02:13,000
<i>Kiss him!
Kiss him!</i>

1016
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,640
- Kiss him!
- Don't do this!

1017
01:02:15,640 --> 01:02:17,320
Don't do this!

1018
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:25,000
[A big fat kiss twice on his head!]

1019
01:02:29,310 --> 01:02:30,660
I get it now...

1020
01:02:31,040 --> 01:02:32,450
I get it now.

1021
01:02:32,450 --> 01:02:33,930
I'm Song Ji Hyo.

1022
01:02:37,710 --> 01:02:42,320
[That woman of 1938...]

1023
01:02:42,320 --> 01:02:46,470
[Has been reincarnated as me.]

1024
01:02:52,740 --> 01:02:56,270
[Mr. Capable going into hiding for now
in fear of becoming everyone's target.]

1025
01:02:58,770 --> 01:03:00,360
There's Jong Kook.

1026
01:03:00,830 --> 01:03:04,190
- Let's talk. Let's just talk.
- Can you give us your word?

1027
01:03:05,500 --> 01:03:09,000
[Mr. Capable proposing to work things
out by calmly talking things through.]

1028
01:03:10,390 --> 01:03:14,440
[There's no real need to attack Jong Kook
even if he was the winner in 1938 anymore.]

1029
01:03:14,440 --> 01:03:18,740
Since all of you think that I was the
winner, let's go find me first.

1030
01:03:18,740 --> 01:03:24,390
[Proposing that they go to find who
the past Jong Kook has been reincarnated as.]

1031
01:03:24,390 --> 01:03:27,440
- Let's go find him.
- Let's go find Kim Jong Kook first.

1032
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:29,370
Let's go find him and see if
that person was the winner or not.

1033
01:03:29,370 --> 01:03:33,220
Me from the previous life... even though
I haven't experienced anything yet

1034
01:03:33,220 --> 01:03:34,940
I did have a certain situation
happen to me.

1035
01:03:34,940 --> 01:03:38,440
But I did see Jong Kook being
pelted with balls.

1036
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:40,330
- You got pelted by balls?
- Yes.

1037
01:03:40,330 --> 01:03:42,700
[Jong Kook from 1938 got hit
by flying balls!]

1038
01:03:43,850 --> 01:03:46,650
[1938]

1039
01:03:46,650 --> 01:03:48,130
<i>What is everyone doing?</i>

1040
01:03:48,130 --> 01:03:52,770
[As Jong Kook walks on by...]

1041
01:03:52,770 --> 01:03:57,380
[They suddenly started
throwing their balls at him!]

1042
01:03:57,380 --> 01:03:59,030
<i>What are you guys doing?</i>

1043
01:04:01,660 --> 01:04:02,960
<i>What are you guys doing?</i>

1044
01:04:02,970 --> 01:04:04,160
<i>What's wrong with you guys?</i>

1045
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:06,100
<i>Everyone has something
happening to them.</i>

1046
01:04:06,910 --> 01:04:11,290
[They didn't know the meaning of those
events back when they were happening...]

1047
01:04:12,980 --> 01:04:15,490
- Then then one getting hit by balls...
- That's me.

1048
01:04:15,490 --> 01:04:18,210
- Getting hit by balls is me.
- I saw him getting hit by balls.

1049
01:04:18,220 --> 01:04:20,760
[If they see anyone being beaten by balls,
that person was Kim Jong Kook in past life!]

1050
01:04:33,150 --> 01:04:34,460
This is...

1051
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:38,810
Wait...

1052
01:04:40,060 --> 01:04:41,810
Wait...wait!

1053
01:04:42,540 --> 01:04:45,030
What's wrong with you guys?
Why are you doing this?

1054
01:04:45,030 --> 01:04:46,850
What are you doing?
Why are you doing this to me?

1055
01:04:48,640 --> 01:04:51,960
[Giraffe being pelted by
countless flying balls.]

1056
01:04:53,250 --> 01:04:55,350
In the previous life, this was...

1057
01:04:55,350 --> 01:04:57,000
[You've figured out why
you're getting pelted, right?]

1058
01:04:57,250 --> 01:04:58,840
My head really hurts!

1059
01:05:03,530 --> 01:05:08,280
[Remembers seeing a person getting hit by
flying balls in the past life back in 1938.]

1060
01:05:09,770 --> 01:05:11,640
Those people that were playing
catch with those balls...

1061
01:05:12,770 --> 01:05:14,650
Who were they throwing the balls at?

1062
01:05:14,650 --> 01:05:17,410
I'm sorry. Do any of you remember
anything about the past life?

1063
01:05:18,780 --> 01:05:20,580
Anyone with the memory of
the past life?

1064
01:05:21,670 --> 01:05:23,920
Wait! Just a minute!

1065
01:05:25,320 --> 01:05:28,610
[Instead of responding with words,
they respond by throwing balls.]

1066
01:05:29,300 --> 01:05:31,100
This isn't what's important right now!

1067
01:05:31,960 --> 01:05:37,520
[What difference does it make if
he was a tiger in his past life...]

1068
01:05:41,160 --> 01:05:42,640
Who was it?

1069
01:05:47,380 --> 01:05:52,280
[The Tiger that shouted out at the world...]

1070
01:05:52,280 --> 01:05:57,290
[Has become a Giraffe that gets
beaten up by flying balls.]

1071

[On the other hand...]

1072
01:06:04,100 --> 01:06:07,570
[Who was I in the previous life?]

1073
01:06:08,370 --> 01:06:10,520
Then someone else...

1074
01:06:14,620 --> 01:06:16,070
Oh my... oh my!

1075
01:06:19,430 --> 01:06:20,790
I'm sorry!

1076
01:06:21,180 --> 01:06:24,910
[Wait? This scene is...]

1077
01:06:24,910 --> 01:06:26,650
Wait, wait, wait...

1078
01:06:27,260 --> 01:06:29,760
[Familiar music sheets...]

1079
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:32,900
[A familiar face?]

1080
01:06:32,900 --> 01:06:34,430
I've seen you before.

1081
01:06:36,250 --> 01:06:40,230
By any chance... in the past life...

1082
01:06:40,230 --> 01:06:42,720
- You're so beautiful.
- Oh my goodness.

1083
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:45,410
- Then goodbye.
- No, you're more beautiful than I.

1084
01:06:46,320 --> 01:06:51,530
[It's a phrase that could give hint to
who she was in her past life...]

1085
01:06:57,340 --> 01:06:59,970
Carrying those sheet music around...

1086
01:06:59,970 --> 01:07:02,020
[The woman dropping her sheet music
after bumping into someone...]

1087
01:07:02,020 --> 01:07:04,640
[Who did it happen to in the past life?]

1088
01:07:04,640 --> 01:07:09,340
[Who do you think it was?]

1089
01:07:14,660 --> 01:07:19,970
[That's correct! It was farmer Gary!]

1090
01:07:26,290 --> 01:07:27,810
- Was it a woman with sheet music?
- You startled me.

1091
01:07:27,810 --> 01:07:29,340
- Was it a woman with sheet music?
- That's right.

1092
01:07:30,030 --> 01:07:31,830
- Tell me honestly.
- About what?

1093
01:07:31,830 --> 01:07:34,970
Tell me honestly since you and I
worked together in our past life.

1094
01:07:34,970 --> 01:07:38,110
I know. But why don't you take your hands
off of me and we'll talk? You're scaring me.

1095
01:07:38,110 --> 01:07:39,720
Okay then. Let's stand like this.

1096
01:07:39,720 --> 01:07:40,960
- Gary...
- Yeah?

1097
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:43,090
If you were the winner...

1098
01:07:43,160 --> 01:07:46,150
If you were by any chance the winner in the
past life, you have to protect me right now.

1099
01:07:46,150 --> 01:07:48,110
- Are you Kang Gary?
- Yeah.

1100
01:07:48,110 --> 01:07:49,810
- Do you know who I am?
- Who are you?

1101
01:07:50,390 --> 01:07:52,420
I wonder if this is fate
playing a joke on us?

1102
01:07:53,740 --> 01:07:55,890
He gave me a bouquet of flowers.

1103
01:07:57,990 --> 01:08:02,120
I thought he asked for a hug in the past,
but this time, he asked for a kiss...

1104
01:08:02,870 --> 01:08:04,740
So I ended up getting kissed by a man.

1105
01:08:05,580 --> 01:08:07,570
- You got kissed?
- Yeah.

1106
01:08:07,570 --> 01:08:09,810
- You got a love confession?
- That's right.

1107
01:08:09,810 --> 01:08:11,870
I feel a little confused right now.

1108
01:08:12,600 --> 01:08:16,270
Since we're the Monday Couple,
I'm supposed to like me in this situation.

1109
01:08:16,280 --> 01:08:20,000
[Monday couple who's souls have been
switched during the reincarnation.]

1110
01:08:21,030 --> 01:08:24,010
Anyways... the woman with the sheet
music came up to you?

1111
01:08:24,010 --> 01:08:25,270
- Yeah.
- Really?

1112
01:08:25,270 --> 01:08:26,410
Gary...

1113
01:08:26,410 --> 01:08:28,230
Tell me honestly.

1114
01:08:29,080 --> 01:08:30,670
After bumping into her...

1115
01:08:31,270 --> 01:08:35,410
I lied on my way down here to see you
because I thought it was you.

1116
01:08:35,610 --> 01:08:38,320
- Were you the winner in the past life?
- No, I wasn't.

1117
01:08:38,460 --> 01:08:41,040
The thing that you need to think
carefully about right now...

1118
01:08:41,280 --> 01:08:43,830
is if by any chance,
my name tag gets ripped off...

1119
01:08:44,580 --> 01:08:49,840
- If my keys were to end up going to...
- Yeah, the keys will get handed over.

1120
01:08:50,230 --> 01:08:53,550
Will you be okay if that person
ends up being Jong Kook?

1121
01:08:53,550 --> 01:08:56,050
No, even if you were to get ousted,
the keys won't get forfeited.

1122
01:08:56,050 --> 01:08:58,710
Jong Kook has all the keys already!

1123
01:08:58,710 --> 01:09:01,070
[Gary insisting to the end that the
winner from the past was Jong Kook.]

1124
01:09:02,090 --> 01:09:04,210
Hey, what did you have
happen to you?

1125
01:09:04,660 --> 01:09:06,780
- I kept being forced to drink water.
- Who did that?

1126
01:09:06,780 --> 01:09:08,690
<i>- I kept being forced to drink water.
- Who did that?</i>

1127
01:09:09,320 --> 01:09:11,880
I approached a group of people and
they kept forcing me to drink water.

1128
01:09:12,680 --> 01:09:14,690
- Wait a minute then...
- What did you have happen to you?

1129
01:09:14,940 --> 01:09:17,600
- I received a bouquet of flowers.
- That means you're Ji Hyo!

1130
01:09:18,190 --> 01:09:20,240
Ji Hyo received a bouquet of flowers
in past life, right?

1131
01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:23,260
Then what did Jong Kook have
to go through?

1132
01:09:23,260 --> 01:09:25,270
Balls... Jong Kook got pelted by balls.

1133
01:09:25,280 --> 01:09:27,160
<i>Balls... Jong Kook got pelted by balls.</i>

1134
01:09:31,570 --> 01:09:35,000
- But...
- I can tell by Kwang Soo's expression!

1135
01:09:35,430 --> 01:09:37,780
- Look at Kwang Soo's expression.
- Whatever the case...

1136
01:09:39,010 --> 01:09:42,960
No matter the case, who we've been
reincarnated as isn't what's important.

1137
01:09:44,230 --> 01:09:48,650
[This man who used to be Kim Jong Kook
in the past life...]

1138
01:09:49,360 --> 01:09:51,270
- No...
- You got hit by balls, didn't you?

1139
01:09:51,270 --> 01:09:52,780
You got hit by balls, didn't you?

1140
01:09:52,780 --> 01:09:54,770
- No... it wasn't that.
- You...

1141
01:09:55,400 --> 01:09:58,510
[Impossible to control
his own facial expressions.]

1142
01:09:58,510 --> 01:10:00,640
- I did see people throwing around the balls.
- Yeah, okay?

1143
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:03,440
Just tell me the truth.
I know you got hit by the balls.

1144
01:10:04,280 --> 01:10:06,970
- Don't try to fool me like this.
- Look at him.

1145
01:10:06,970 --> 01:10:08,860
[Always breaks into laughter
whenever he tries to lie.]

1146
01:10:08,860 --> 01:10:11,030
You'll know for yourself if we
went there.

1147
01:10:11,030 --> 01:10:13,470
If we were to go and you see who they
were throwing the balls at

1148
01:10:13,470 --> 01:10:14,620
you'd know who Jong Kook is.

1149
01:10:14,620 --> 01:10:15,730
Then let's just go and see.

1150
01:10:15,730 --> 01:10:19,450
Since I'm not sure of the situation yet,
let's go where the balls are being thrown.

1151
01:10:19,450 --> 01:10:21,760
Then who had to drink the water?
Who drank the water in the past?

1152
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:24,660
The reason for that being Kwang Soo,
in the past life...

1153
01:10:24,660 --> 01:10:28,570
- I saw Kim Jong Kook...
- Look at you smiling again.

1154
01:10:28,570 --> 01:10:31,050
It's not because of that. I just
had something funny happen to me.

1155
01:10:31,700 --> 01:10:33,590
- Why don't we just go and see first?
- Okay, let's go.

1156
01:10:33,590 --> 01:10:36,360
- On the seventh floor...
- You lead the way.

1157
01:10:37,560 --> 01:10:41,880
[The reincarnated fool Giraffe...
what will become of his fate?]

1158
01:10:44,780 --> 01:10:47,480
[Arrives at the fateful basketball court!]

1159
01:10:47,480 --> 01:10:49,210
I'll go in first then.

1160
01:10:52,670 --> 01:10:56,480
[As suspected, nothing happens.]

1161
01:10:56,480 --> 01:10:57,740
<i>Why don't you go in, Ji Hyo?</i>

1162
01:11:00,790 --> 01:11:03,990
[Kwang Soo's turn to enter the court.]

1163
01:11:03,990 --> 01:11:06,020
Which way shall I go?

1164
01:11:06,020 --> 01:11:07,100
Where?

1165
01:11:08,570 --> 01:11:11,670
[A slew of balls being thrown at him
like a meteor shower.]

1166
01:11:12,870 --> 01:11:16,440
[That's why you should've just
told the truth earlier...]

1167
01:11:16,450 --> 01:11:19,140
- Come here, come here.
- What I did was wrong.

1168
01:11:20,540 --> 01:11:23,400
Hey, you need to be careful. You're
going to get chased right away now.

1169
01:11:23,410 --> 01:11:25,870
You're now Jong Kook's immediate target.

1170
01:11:26,230 --> 01:11:27,580
Just trust me.

1171
01:11:28,180 --> 01:11:30,480
- Let's work well together, the three of us.
- Seriously.

1172
01:11:33,930 --> 01:11:36,410
Ji Hyo! Hurry up and rip it off!

1173
01:11:36,410 --> 01:11:37,590
[Gary and Ji Hyo attack Kwang Soo!]

1174
01:11:38,040 --> 01:11:40,160
[Ace Ji Hyo jumps in the fray!]

1175
01:11:41,750 --> 01:11:44,250
[Gary succeeds in eliminating Kwang Soo!]

1176
01:11:45,180 --> 01:11:47,260
<i>Kim Jong Kook...</i>

1177
01:11:47,870 --> 01:11:49,190
How could you do this to me?

1178
01:11:49,190 --> 01:11:53,380
[If Jong Kook was the winner in the past,
then the keys are now in Gary's possession.]

1179
01:11:53,380 --> 01:11:54,620
- Here.
- What the heck?

1180
01:11:54,620 --> 01:11:59,680
[But where are the keys,
and why is he being rushed off to jail?]

1181
01:11:59,680 --> 01:12:03,050
[Could it be?]

1182
01:12:03,050 --> 01:12:04,570
- Tell me honestly.
- Tell you what?

1183
01:12:04,570 --> 01:12:07,300
Why isn't there anything?
Shouldn't there be keys after this?

1184
01:12:07,300 --> 01:12:11,890
[Then does it mean that the winner wasn't
Jong Kook in the past, but it was...]

1185
01:12:11,890 --> 01:12:14,170
In my opinion, I think the writers
are just not giving us the keys right now.

1186
01:12:14,930 --> 01:12:17,480
- Let's just go downstairs and talk.
- Are you joking?

1187
01:12:17,480 --> 01:12:19,300
You think this is
my first time on Running Man?

1188
01:12:20,520 --> 01:12:24,010
[Something is suspicious about Gary!]

1189
01:12:24,610 --> 01:12:26,560
Hurry up and tell me!

1190
01:12:28,210 --> 01:12:31,050
[Gary surprise attacks Ji Hyo!]

1191
01:12:31,820 --> 01:12:35,190
[The ultimate face-off
between the Monday Couple!]

1192
01:12:41,410 --> 01:12:43,150
[Gary succeeds in eliminating Ji Hyo!]

1193
01:12:43,150 --> 01:12:45,030
- Ji Hyo, I'm sorry.
- Gary!

1194
01:12:45,030 --> 01:12:48,500
[Gary - Mayor's office.]

1195
01:12:49,870 --> 01:12:53,240
[That's right, it was me...]

1196
01:12:58,220 --> 01:13:01,430
[1938]

1197
01:13:02,940 --> 01:13:07,050
[Mr. Capable vs. Gary as the
final two survivors!]

1198
01:13:07,050 --> 01:13:08,490
Please don't be like this.

1199
01:13:08,490 --> 01:13:09,690
Wait... wait.

1200
01:13:09,690 --> 01:13:12,380
[Two people who know each
other so well.]

1201
01:13:16,980 --> 01:13:19,940
[They both grabbed onto each other's
name tag simultaneously!]

1202
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:25,200
[Oh my goodness!]

1203
01:13:25,200 --> 01:13:29,270
[Gary eliminates Mr. Capable!]

1204
01:13:29,270 --> 01:13:31,950
I won! I'm the final winner!

1205
01:13:31,950 --> 01:13:36,470
[Kang Gary was the ultimate winner
in 1938!]

1206
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:42,930
[The seven keys needed to open the
treasure chest came into his hands!]

1207
01:13:44,450 --> 01:13:49,570
[After his victory, Kang Gary unlocks
the locks one by one.]

1208
01:13:51,010 --> 01:13:55,700
What kind of gold will it be that
sets my heart beating?

1209
01:13:55,700 --> 01:13:57,730
This isn't it...

1210
01:14:02,290 --> 01:14:04,110
[Opens up all seven of the locks.]

1211
01:14:05,580 --> 01:14:09,740
Now... I'll get to order around
my own servants...

1212
01:14:09,740 --> 01:14:11,430
And I'll buy myself ten cows.

1213
01:14:11,440 --> 01:14:13,900
And get myself a pretty little wife.

1214
01:14:13,900 --> 01:14:16,450
Then I'll build myself a nice
home in Gangnam.

1215
01:14:18,210 --> 01:14:20,020
Welcome to my world.

1216
01:14:23,980 --> 01:14:26,520
[An empty chest?]

1217
01:14:27,770 --> 01:14:32,140
[The chest that he went through the trouble
to open was a deploy to thwart off thieves!]

1218
01:14:32,140 --> 01:14:35,890
Kim Jong Kook... after catching that lion,
that tiger...

1219
01:14:35,890 --> 01:14:39,110
and I got my hands on the seven keys,
but what the heck is this?

1220
01:14:39,110 --> 01:14:40,490
Why?

1221
01:14:40,500 --> 01:14:42,140
<i>What is this?</i>

1222
01:14:42,140 --> 01:14:44,580
<i>Why?</i>

1223
01:14:49,710 --> 01:14:52,820
[2013]

1224
01:14:53,430 --> 01:14:55,070
[The keys that disappeared from the
Mayor's office in 1938...

1225
01:14:55,070 --> 01:14:59,240
[Is now in the Mayor's office in 2013?]

1226
01:14:59,240 --> 01:15:01,830
What are you going to do about all the hair
you yanked out along with the name tag?

1227
01:15:02,440 --> 01:15:04,630
I'm really sorry. But...

1228
01:15:04,630 --> 01:15:08,020
- I really wanted to work together too...
- You think you can go up against him?

1229
01:15:08,150 --> 01:15:09,990
I can't trust you either.

1230
01:15:12,200 --> 01:15:15,280
- Ji Hyo, I'm sorry. I'll...
- You fool!

1231
01:15:15,280 --> 01:15:17,160
I'll give you 2% of my gold.

1232
01:15:17,160 --> 01:15:18,720
Give me 10%.

1233
01:15:18,720 --> 01:15:20,970
- Okay.
- Since I'm going to have a bit.

1234
01:15:20,970 --> 01:15:24,940
[Promises to give her 10% of his prize
considering their partnership 80 years ago.]

1235
01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:27,910
[Ji Hyo - Out!]

1236
01:15:30,270 --> 01:15:35,170
[Gary rushes off to the Mayor's office
where the keys have been preserved.]

1237
01:15:37,900 --> 01:15:38,910
Let's go.

1238
01:15:46,200 --> 01:15:52,410
[Huh? What is Grandmother
Dong Wan doing there?]

1239
01:15:52,410 --> 01:15:53,840
What are you doing here, Dong Wan?

1240
01:15:55,090 --> 01:15:58,000
- Have you come for this?
- Yes.

1241
01:15:58,000 --> 01:15:59,630
Here are the keys.

1242
01:16:02,290 --> 01:16:06,340
[The seven keys are once again
in Gary's hands...]

1243
01:16:06,340 --> 01:16:08,560
These are the keys that I had
80 years ago.

1244
01:16:08,850 --> 01:16:12,030
Since you look like a nice man...
I'll tell you a secret.

1245
01:16:12,030 --> 01:16:13,200
Okay.

1246
01:16:14,700 --> 01:16:16,870
Just a single person out of all of you...

1247
01:16:17,530 --> 01:16:19,910
has been reincarnated in the same
image as their previous life.

1248
01:16:21,190 --> 01:16:26,490
[There's someone who's been reincarnated
in the same image as their previous life?]

1249
01:16:26,490 --> 01:16:29,420
[Wait...]

1250
01:16:30,130 --> 01:16:34,290
<i>Two of the same treasure chests were
produced originally to thwart off thieves.</i>

1251
01:16:34,290 --> 01:16:37,230
<i>But the whereabouts of one of
the chests are still unknown.</i>

1252
01:16:37,580 --> 01:16:41,510
Then the chest I opened in my previous
life was a decoy?

1253
01:16:41,510 --> 01:16:43,580
Then it means I have to go find
the real treasure chest now?

1254
01:16:43,580 --> 01:16:46,290
[The treasure chest he opened
in 1938 was a fake...]

1255
01:16:47,910 --> 01:16:52,510
[Then the person who's been reincarnated
in their original form must know the location.]

1256
01:16:52,510 --> 01:16:54,110
- Is it just one person?
- One person.

1257
01:16:54,110 --> 01:16:57,550
- Then can you tell me who that is?
- That's a secret.

1258
01:16:57,550 --> 01:16:58,840
Why, Grandmother?

1259
01:16:59,120 --> 01:17:03,070
Then how important is the information
that one person knows?

1260
01:17:03,070 --> 01:17:05,050
That's as far as I can tell you.

1261
01:17:06,500 --> 01:17:10,010
Go find that person. Then
you'll get what it is that you're after.

1262
01:17:11,160 --> 01:17:12,590
- Good luck.
- Yes.

1263
01:17:12,590 --> 01:17:14,490
[Just one person who's been
reincarnated in their original image...]

1264
01:17:14,490 --> 01:17:19,000
[The whereabouts of the real
treasure chest is known by him alone!]

1265
01:17:29,290 --> 01:17:30,730
What? What is it?

1266
01:17:32,290 --> 01:17:33,810
What? What is it?

1267
01:17:34,780 --> 01:17:37,160
[A mob dance flash?]

1268
01:17:39,850 --> 01:17:44,330
[But.. that's...]

1269
01:17:46,840 --> 01:17:49,900
[1938]

1270
01:17:50,680 --> 01:17:52,190
This is like a musical.

1271
01:17:52,190 --> 01:17:55,910
[The song that he danced to in 1938...]

1272
01:17:57,270 --> 01:18:00,130
[And in 2013, it's 'Gangnam Style'.]

1273
01:18:00,130 --> 01:18:03,430
This is a signal as to who I am.
No... I can't stay here.

1274
01:18:07,710 --> 01:18:10,570
[On the other hand,
the prisoners of the present are...]

1275
01:18:11,060 --> 01:18:13,730
[Bored...]

1276
01:18:14,380 --> 01:18:17,200
Let's play a round of paper-rock-scissors,
and draw a mole on the loser's nose.

1277
01:18:18,310 --> 01:18:20,240
[Thinking up of games to pass the time
out of boredom.]

1278
01:18:20,240 --> 01:18:21,820
- Seriously?
- Just a single round.

1279
01:18:22,130 --> 01:18:23,550
Paper-rock-scissors!

1280
01:18:51,570 --> 01:18:53,010
Another round?

1281
01:18:53,880 --> 01:18:55,310
Paper-rock-scissors!

1282
01:19:05,550 --> 01:19:07,110
I'll draw it small.

1283
01:19:16,730 --> 01:19:18,820
I can see the black with my own eyes.

1284
01:19:19,350 --> 01:19:21,450
I can see the black with my own eyes!

1285
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:23,800
I can see it right here.

1286
01:19:23,810 --> 01:19:26,150
I was looking down here
but my vision all of a sudden got black!

1287
01:19:27,390 --> 01:19:28,930
- That much is called for...
- Jae Suk.

1288
01:19:28,930 --> 01:19:31,490
I drew it small enough that you can't see
with your eyes, and it's cute.

1289
01:19:31,490 --> 01:19:38,130
[Please make sure to check their faces
later to see how it all turns out.]

1290
01:19:41,820 --> 01:19:45,960
[Gary starting to thoroughly check
around for the real treasure chest.]

1291
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:53,210
[The person who's been reincarnated in
their own image from the previous life...]

1292
01:19:53,210 --> 01:19:57,830
[That person definitely knows something!]

1293
01:20:01,840 --> 01:20:05,000
I can't believe a place like this exists
underneath the city hall.

1294
01:20:05,010 --> 01:20:11,340
[Gary heading down to the civil agency
in the basement of city hall.]

1295
01:20:12,880 --> 01:20:15,760
[Who could it be...]

1296
01:20:15,760 --> 01:20:23,040
[Who's been reincarnated
in their original image?]

1297
01:20:24,070 --> 01:20:25,410
Ji Hyo!

1298
01:20:25,410 --> 01:20:29,180
[The four remaining survivors who have
all finally converged at the same place.]

1299
01:20:30,780 --> 01:20:34,270
Seriously...
I don't know what I should do here.

1300
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:36,820
- Let's just end it. It's time.
- Yeah, Dong Hoon.

1301
01:20:36,820 --> 01:20:41,620
[Gary is suspicious of Ha Ha who
hasn't been seen around too much today.]

1302
01:20:44,290 --> 01:20:47,600
[An unforeseen circumstance!
Even Mr. Capable is on the move!]

1303
01:20:47,600 --> 01:20:49,070
- Why are you moving?
- So I can protect you.

1304
01:20:49,070 --> 01:20:52,820
[All the four remaining survivors
are now out for themselves!]

1305
01:20:52,820 --> 01:20:55,310
[A breaking point!]

1306
01:20:55,310 --> 01:20:57,710
- I don't know who to go for!
- Trust me! Just trust me!

1307
01:20:57,890 --> 01:21:02,100
[Desperate state of anxiety
not knowing who to trust!]

1308
01:21:02,100 --> 01:21:03,610
Just trust me!

1309
01:21:08,110 --> 01:21:10,470
- You sure are quick!
- Look at how good you are in your spandex.

1310
01:21:11,130 --> 01:21:12,530
Your shirt is really...

1311
01:21:12,530 --> 01:21:17,840
[Now that we take a closer look...
it's these two again!]

1312
01:21:18,920 --> 01:21:28,150
[The fateful destiny...
that travels through time!]

1313
01:21:33,840 --> 01:21:38,410
[Mr. Capable eliminates Gary!]

1314
01:21:39,560 --> 01:21:41,300
- You're really quick.
- What is that? You had something?

1315
01:21:41,300 --> 01:21:46,290
[Rule: The seven keys he had must
be handed over to Jong Kook.]

1316
01:21:46,290 --> 01:21:48,590
- Then who won the last round?
- I told you, it was Kang Gary!

1317
01:21:48,590 --> 01:21:50,380
Then you really won?

1318
01:21:51,490 --> 01:21:53,130
When I was given the keys earlier...

1319
01:21:53,130 --> 01:21:56,870
[He reveals the secret Grandmother Dong Wan
told him earlier in the Mayor's office.]

1320
01:21:57,140 --> 01:21:59,220
- That Grandmother told me a secret.
- What did he say?

1321
01:21:59,220 --> 01:22:04,830
<i>There's one person amongst you who's been
reincarnated in their original image.</i>

1322
01:22:04,830 --> 01:22:06,260
It's him then.

1323
01:22:06,260 --> 01:22:07,530
- It's him.
- Ah...

1324
01:22:08,310 --> 01:22:10,470
This is the end of what I
have to tell you.

1325
01:22:13,530 --> 01:22:17,190
[Ha Ha is awfully suspicious!
What secret is he harboring?]

1326
01:22:17,190 --> 01:22:19,060
- We have to catch him!
- I think he knows something!

1327
01:22:24,820 --> 01:22:28,720
[Corners him into a dead end!]

1328
01:22:31,260 --> 01:22:33,390
That grandmother is such a jokester!

1329
01:22:34,230 --> 01:22:36,810
[You know... Grandmother Dong Wan?]

1330
01:22:37,270 --> 01:22:39,200
[Just what is the secret Ha Ha has?]

1331
01:22:40,810 --> 01:22:43,850
[1938]

1332
01:22:44,830 --> 01:22:49,850
[Ha Ha back in 1938 as he arrives
at the city hall on a secret mission.]

1333
01:22:50,900 --> 01:22:53,400
Young man over there...
come here for a moment.

1334
01:22:53,400 --> 01:22:55,670
[Grandmother Dong Wan calling
Ha Ha over?]

1335
01:22:56,220 --> 01:22:57,680
Hello, Grandmother.

1336
01:23:00,790 --> 01:23:02,440
Best of luck in the new year,
and prosperous health to you.

1337
01:23:02,440 --> 01:23:05,630
- You... came to find the treasure, right?
- Yes!

1338
01:23:05,960 --> 01:23:09,430
Gold... I came to find the gold bars.
It's in a treasure chest!

1339
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:11,470
- Want me to tell you how to get it?
- Yes!

1340
01:23:11,860 --> 01:23:14,740
The truth is...
there are two treasure chests.

1341
01:23:15,860 --> 01:23:19,690
<i>To thwart off any possible thieves,
they made two exact same chests.</i>

1342
01:23:20,250 --> 01:23:25,980
The real chest between the two
that you'll see in the Mayor's office...

1343
01:23:26,990 --> 01:23:28,910
<i>- Is the one on the right.
- The one on the right?</i>

1344
01:23:29,870 --> 01:23:32,980
[He wasn't late getting to the office,
but he was in fact the first to arrive...]

1345
01:23:34,160 --> 01:23:35,890
The gold...

1346
01:23:37,060 --> 01:23:38,630
This is so heavy!

1347
01:23:41,980 --> 01:23:44,830
Quickly... I need to hide this somewhere!
Where should I hide this thing?

1348
01:23:49,940 --> 01:23:52,480
Why are you telling me this?

1349
01:23:52,480 --> 01:23:55,020
You want me to do something for you?

1350
01:23:55,020 --> 01:23:57,300
I'm telling you this since you're
the first one to arrive.

1351
01:23:57,300 --> 01:23:58,550
I'm the first one here?

1352
01:23:59,050 --> 01:24:02,010
Have you ever heard of the term,
reincarnation?

1353
01:24:02,710 --> 01:24:04,340
Reincarnation?

1354
01:24:04,990 --> 01:24:09,930
In your next life... you will be the only one
who'll be reincarnated in your own image.

1355
01:24:09,930 --> 01:24:12,010
- The only one?
- Just as you are now.

1356
01:24:12,370 --> 01:24:15,110
You'll be reincarnated with the same
memories and the same image as now.

1357
01:24:15,910 --> 01:24:21,980
[Therefore, only the reincarnated Ha Ha will
know the location of the hidden chest!]

1358
01:24:23,180 --> 01:24:25,650
Don't tell anyone about this.

1359
01:24:31,320 --> 01:24:36,090
[Ha Ha is the only one who knows
where the treasure chest is hidden!]

1360
01:24:39,750 --> 01:24:46,590
[If he can only get the keys in his hands,
everything will go as he planned!]

1361
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:57,300
- You know something!
- So it wasn't a lie.

1362
01:24:57,300 --> 01:25:01,160
I bet if we oust him, we can find out
where the treasure chest is hidden.

1363
01:25:02,790 --> 01:25:05,900
I wonder...
why that grandmother did this to me?

1364
01:25:05,900 --> 01:25:09,580
[If Suk Jin and Jong Kook wants to find
the treasure chest, they must oust Ha Ha!]

1365
01:25:09,580 --> 01:25:11,490
We should've just ousted you
no matter what.

1366
01:25:12,260 --> 01:25:17,110
[Ha Ha is in a situation where
he just can't give up easily!]

1367
01:25:17,110 --> 01:25:18,330
Come on... come get me!

1368
01:25:18,790 --> 01:25:21,990
[Planning on sticking it out
through the attack.]

1369
01:25:21,990 --> 01:25:24,880
- This is good.
- Grab him by the wrist.

1370
01:25:29,410 --> 01:25:31,240
Let go! Let go of me!

1371
01:25:32,240 --> 01:25:33,580
I'm so close!

1372
01:25:33,590 --> 01:25:35,110
Close to what?

1373
01:25:35,430 --> 01:25:37,550
The victory is right in front of my eyes!

1374
01:25:37,550 --> 01:25:40,260
I know where it is... it's so close!

1375
01:25:43,880 --> 01:25:45,840
- You saw, didn't you?
- You're something else!

1376
01:25:46,640 --> 01:25:49,110
I'll hold onto him, and you rip it off.

1377
01:25:49,690 --> 01:25:53,630
[It seems as though Suk Jin has made up
his mind to work together with Jong Kook.]

1378
01:25:53,630 --> 01:25:55,460
- Suk Jin, you have to rip it off!
- Okay!

1379
01:25:55,460 --> 01:25:56,880
Hurry up and rip it off!
Why aren't you ripping it off?

1380
01:25:56,880 --> 01:25:58,140
Hurry up!

1381
01:25:58,140 --> 01:26:00,620
[Suk Jin attacks Jong Kook!]

1382
01:26:00,620 --> 01:26:04,130
[Coalition, my butt! There's no
friendship on the road to victory!]

1383
01:26:05,200 --> 01:26:07,780
[Tiger vs. Impala!]

1384
01:26:12,570 --> 01:26:16,070
[Suk Jin eliminates Mr. Capable!]

1385
01:26:16,070 --> 01:26:21,970
[2013 topic of conversation:
Big-nosed Brother ousts Mr. Capable!]

1386
01:26:21,970 --> 01:26:24,970
No one make a move!
2013 is my year!

1387
01:26:24,980 --> 01:26:26,790
Suk Jin! You're awesome!

1388
01:26:27,920 --> 01:26:32,650
[Ah... his broken dreams of winning...]

1389
01:26:33,850 --> 01:26:38,710
[The seven keys are now in
Suk Jin's hands.]

1390
01:26:38,710 --> 01:26:42,300
[The man with the keys vs. the
man who hid away the treasure chest.]

1391
01:26:43,210 --> 01:26:44,980
You really are awesome today.

1392
01:26:46,130 --> 01:26:48,420
- I'm getting greedy now.
- Good!

1393
01:26:48,670 --> 01:26:50,350
I'm feeling greedy too.

1394
01:26:53,120 --> 01:26:56,880
I'm tired. People who fight like us
get tired out too easily.

1395
01:26:58,680 --> 01:27:00,860
- That hurts!
- Sorry.

1396
01:27:05,360 --> 01:27:07,200
[They both have their hands
on the name tag!]

1397
01:27:08,150 --> 01:27:12,620
[They both...
have the name tag in their hands!]

1398
01:27:16,890 --> 01:27:19,710
I ripped it off first...
I got it first.

1399
01:27:20,140 --> 01:27:22,350
I was first!
Ha Dong Hoon is the victor!

1400
01:27:22,350 --> 01:27:25,260
With all my strength,
I beat Ji Suk Jin!

1401
01:27:25,260 --> 01:27:28,020
The victory is mine!

1402
01:27:29,070 --> 01:27:31,890
The victory is mine!
This is unbelievable!

1403
01:27:31,890 --> 01:27:37,410
[Haroro with the seven keys
finally in his hands.]

1404
01:27:38,340 --> 01:27:41,890
Since I'm the only one who knows
where it's hidden...

1405
01:27:43,360 --> 01:27:48,840
[The location of where he hid away
the treasure chest 80 years ago!]

1406
01:27:54,270 --> 01:27:59,240
[The same place in 1938...]

1407
01:27:59,240 --> 01:28:03,510
[In a side hallway of city hall...]

1408
01:28:08,940 --> 01:28:15,380
[In the same location in the
city hall of 2013!]

1409
01:28:20,820 --> 01:28:22,250
This is unbelievable!

1410
01:28:30,930 --> 01:28:32,390
Want me to help you?

1411
01:28:33,810 --> 01:28:35,570
I thought I almost had it...

1412
01:28:36,280 --> 01:28:39,410
But what does it say on your back
anyways? Here it is!

1413
01:28:39,410 --> 01:28:41,820
The place where the past
meets the present.

1414
01:28:41,820 --> 01:28:44,500
So the location of the treasure chest
was on your back?

1415
01:28:44,500 --> 01:28:46,570
[If Ha Ha had been eliminated,
hint to the location could've been earned.]

1416
01:28:46,570 --> 01:28:48,520
- This is where I hid it.
- You hid it?

1417
01:28:48,520 --> 01:28:51,320
- I hid it away.
- You knew where the treasure was?

1418
01:28:51,320 --> 01:28:53,240
I hid it here 80 years ago.

1419
01:28:53,240 --> 01:28:55,920
I haven't been able to sleep for 80 years.
I'm a total insomniac.

1420
01:28:55,920 --> 01:28:59,320
I think for the first time in 80 years,
I'm going to be able to sleep tonight.

1421
01:29:00,350 --> 01:29:02,570
Do you know who you have to thank
for being the winner today?

1422
01:29:02,570 --> 01:29:04,000
- It's thanks to you.
- It's thanks to me, right?

1423
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,510
Yes, even though it's thanks to you,
I did great today.

1424
01:29:10,190 --> 01:29:11,840
[Even though the gold prize
hasn't been brought back yet...]

1425
01:29:11,840 --> 01:29:15,420
[Since this is gold from 1938,
Ha Ha wins the gold!]

1426
01:29:15,420 --> 01:29:19,610
This location speaks of where I hid away
the gold 80 years ago.

1427
01:29:19,610 --> 01:29:22,760
But the gold has been moved over to
the new building just as it was.

1428
01:29:22,760 --> 01:29:25,730
[The gold that he hid away hasn't been
touched in its basement location since.]

1429
01:29:25,730 --> 01:29:27,340
Wow, I can't believe...

1430
01:29:27,800 --> 01:29:31,650
In the third strong man race we've had,
Ha Ha is the victor!

1431
01:29:31,650 --> 01:29:35,700
[The ultimate powerhouse, Ha Ha!]
