00:19:31,155 --> 00:19:32,566
Who's that?
Look over there.

340
00:19:33,681 --> 00:19:35,850
[Caught!]

341
00:19:37,734 --> 00:19:38,759
<i>Who's that?</i>

342
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,034
<i>Who are you?
Who is that?</i>

343
00:19:40,993 --> 00:19:42,399
<i>Who are you?</i>

344
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,628
<i>Who are you?
Who is that?</i>

345
00:19:46,122 --> 00:19:47,706
[Catch her!]

346
00:19:49,016 --> 00:19:50,702
[Chasing after the mysterious woman!]

347
00:19:53,062 --> 00:19:54,410
Huh?
They're chasing someone!

348
00:19:57,008 --> 00:19:58,092
<i>Who?
Who is that?</i>

349
00:19:58,093 --> 00:19:59,636
[Jae Suk is right on her tail!]

350
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:02,529
Excuse me!

351
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,214
[That woman is none other than...]

352
00:20:05,215 --> 00:20:06,954
- Hey!
- Am I right?

353
00:20:06,955 --> 00:20:08,512
- It's Hye Jin!
- Hye Jin!

354
00:20:08,513 --> 00:20:10,512
- What are you doing here?
- See? I thought it was her!

355
00:20:10,513 --> 00:20:12,288
Hye Jin, what are you doing here?

356
00:20:13,228 --> 00:20:15,490
[Actress, Han Hye Jin]

357
00:20:16,834 --> 00:20:19,876
[True beauty that can't be kept hidden
behind a simple disguise.]

358
00:20:25,037 --> 00:20:26,863
[Does she have the key?]

359
00:20:26,864 --> 00:20:27,915
- Where's the key?
- The key?

360
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:29,886
Key?

361
00:20:30,649 --> 00:20:33,017
- What to do? Everyone's here!
- Hello.

362
00:20:33,246 --> 00:20:35,449
[Easy Brothers also arrive on scene.]

363
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:36,786
When did you get here?

364
00:20:38,035 --> 00:20:40,136
- How did you get here?
- Why don't we go this way?

365
00:20:40,137 --> 00:20:41,221
Hye Jin, come this way.

366
00:20:41,463 --> 00:20:43,323
[Taking Hye Jin away?]

367
00:20:43,324 --> 00:20:44,655
<i>Hye Jin, when did you get here?</i>

368
00:20:44,656 --> 00:20:48,395
[So that's what it was... it's a guest!]

369
00:20:51,961 --> 00:20:53,969
[A suspicious looking man walking around
looking very much at ease.]

370
00:20:54,575 --> 00:20:56,761
- Suk Jin, we have to find it.
- A guest has our key.

371
00:20:56,762 --> 00:20:58,918
- Suk Jin, we have to find a guest.
- A guest has our key.

372
00:20:59,651 --> 00:21:02,107
- Is it okay to be caught so soon?
- It's okay.

373
00:21:03,094 --> 00:21:04,325
Sit here.

374
00:21:05,276 --> 00:21:06,365
Sit down.

375
00:21:06,433 --> 00:21:09,991
- Okay... give us the key.
- Okay, healing camp...

376
00:21:09,991 --> 00:21:11,908
Hye Jin used to be on that with us.

377
00:21:12,245 --> 00:21:13,827
This is 'Healing Camp', the Macau edition.

378
00:21:13,828 --> 00:21:15,020
[Macau edition?]

379
00:21:15,565 --> 00:21:17,069
- Give us the key.
- The key?

380
00:21:18,162 --> 00:21:19,351
The key...

381
00:21:20,184 --> 00:21:23,007
- Are you two on the same team?
- Yes, we are. Look at our color.

382
00:21:23,008 --> 00:21:24,905
- Now, the three of us are the same team.
- Oh, really?

383
00:21:25,973 --> 00:21:27,921
[She does have the key!]

384
00:21:30,709 --> 00:21:32,655
Then I bet there are other guests here
other than Hye Jin.

385
00:21:32,656 --> 00:21:34,229
[This person.]

386
00:21:37,387 --> 00:21:40,157
[Traipsing all over Fisherman's Wharf.]

387
00:21:42,243 --> 00:21:43,697
[Guest... guest...]

388
00:21:46,285 --> 00:21:47,441
Where are you going?

389
00:21:51,637 --> 00:21:53,497
[There you are!]

390
00:21:54,983 --> 00:21:56,931
[Long-legged Giraffe on the chase!]

391
00:21:56,932 --> 00:21:58,064
Suk Jin!

392
00:22:02,379 --> 00:22:04,591
[An unbeatable focus...]

393
00:22:05,211 --> 00:22:06,405
I'm coming!

394
00:22:07,363 --> 00:22:08,845
[Finally gets the lock to open.]

395
00:22:11,257 --> 00:22:13,460
[A mission envelope?]

396
00:22:14,513 --> 00:22:15,894
It's a mission card.

397
00:22:19,903 --> 00:22:22,909
<i>[The team with the bag and the person
who provides them with the key are a team.]</i>

398
00:22:22,909 --> 00:22:24,828
<i>[Go find Gladiator Go Dong Wan
at the Coliseum.]</i>

399
00:22:24,828 --> 00:22:26,833
<i>[But you have to take your guest
in the lady chair.]</i>

400
00:22:27,437 --> 00:22:29,378
[Automatically breaking out into a clap
at the mention of a lady chair?]

401
00:22:29,378 --> 00:22:31,780
- But it's okay since Hye Jin is light.
- We're so lucky that we found her.

402
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:33,133
Even from a quick glance,
I can tell Hye Jin is light.

403
00:22:33,133 --> 00:22:34,293
<i>Wait!</i>

404
00:22:34,294 --> 00:22:35,722
- Suk Jin!
- Who is that?

405
00:22:36,909 --> 00:22:38,892
[On a full out chase...]

406
00:22:40,206 --> 00:22:41,441
- Wait!
- Catch him!

407
00:22:42,526 --> 00:22:43,816
Wait!

408
00:22:49,328 --> 00:22:51,577
[Who is this person with
a surprising level of stamina?]

409
00:22:54,407 --> 00:22:57,297
[Total exhaustion.]

410
00:23:02,917 --> 00:23:06,025
[Blank Ji and Gary who don't have a clue
as to what's going on yet.]

411
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:09,116
Do you have a key?
To this bag?

412
00:23:13,262 --> 00:23:15,097
Dong Wook, what are you doing here?

413
00:23:16,483 --> 00:23:18,429
[Dong Wook...
just falls right into their laps!]

414
00:23:19,817 --> 00:23:22,949
[Actor, Lee Dong Wook.]

415
00:23:22,949 --> 00:23:26,630
[Now a familiar face in the variety land...
he is also a guest of the day!]

416
00:23:28,979 --> 00:23:31,520
I'm sorry.
I guess we got lucky running into you.

417
00:23:31,521 --> 00:23:33,006
We just stopped in here to ask
a question ourselves.

418
00:23:34,465 --> 00:23:35,765
Do you have the key?

419
00:23:35,766 --> 00:23:37,973
[Easily hands over the key...]

420
00:23:39,151 --> 00:23:41,923
- Thank you, Dong Wook!
- I'll buy you a cup of coffee!

421
00:23:41,924 --> 00:23:43,403
- I already had some.
- You already had some?

422
00:23:43,404 --> 00:23:45,918
- Then how about a cold glass of tea?
- No, it's okay.

423
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:48,323
- Water will be fine.
- Do you have any citron tea?

424
00:23:49,755 --> 00:23:53,391
Dong Wook's actually close friends with
all of my hip hop friends.

425
00:23:54,215 --> 00:23:56,698
[Exchanging rap verses]

426
00:23:59,837 --> 00:24:01,893
[Starting out by exchanging rap verses out
of their excitement of seeing each other.]

427
00:24:02,737 --> 00:24:04,496
[Checking their mission card after
having opened the bag.]

428
00:24:04,496 --> 00:24:07,602
<i>[The team with the bag and the person who
provided them with the key are now a team.]</i>

429
00:24:07,602 --> 00:24:10,641
<i>[Go see Gladiator Go Dong Wan
at the Coliseum.]</i>

430
00:24:10,641 --> 00:24:14,776
<i>[But, you have to carry your guest
in a lady chair...]</i>

431
00:24:16,444 --> 00:24:17,784
Okay, thank you.

432
00:24:18,414 --> 00:24:21,846
- We won't know until we try it first.
- Why? You've done this a lot in your past?

433
00:24:23,364 --> 00:24:24,899
Here's our chair.

434
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:26,613
Hye Jin, get on.

435
00:24:28,515 --> 00:24:30,356
- I'm pretty heavy.
- No, it's okay.

436
00:24:30,357 --> 00:24:31,872
- Wow...
- You really are kind of heavy.

437
00:24:32,765 --> 00:24:34,276
I don't think we thought that one through.

438
00:24:35,519 --> 00:24:37,062
Where are you keeping the weight?

439
00:24:37,485 --> 00:24:39,531
[Stretching out their muscles first.]

440
00:24:40,207 --> 00:24:43,006
There's some difference in what we were
expecting as far as her weight goes.

441
00:24:43,006 --> 00:24:45,186
- There's some difference.
- I didn't think...

442
00:24:45,187 --> 00:24:47,220
- You're heavier than I expected.
- My back really is...

443
00:24:48,616 --> 00:24:50,562
[Giving the chair another try.]

444
00:24:51,138 --> 00:24:52,354
- Towards the front.
- I feel bad.

445
00:24:52,354 --> 00:24:53,924
- No, it's okay.
- It's okay.

446
00:24:53,924 --> 00:24:55,646
But you could've sat down
from the front.

447
00:24:56,664 --> 00:24:59,908
[Still not getting the hang of it.]

448
00:24:59,909 --> 00:25:03,477
You could've come up to the front and sat
down but you're going about it backwards.

449
00:25:03,478 --> 00:25:05,434
Since it's all about trial and error,
let's give it another try.

450
00:25:06,037 --> 00:25:07,675
This is all about trial and error.

451
00:25:07,675 --> 00:25:09,027
[How will this time go?]

452
00:25:12,888 --> 00:25:15,419
The good thing is,
the coliseum is right ahead.

453
00:25:15,419 --> 00:25:16,848
- Really?
- That is such a relief.

454
00:25:17,384 --> 00:25:20,240
- I'm trying to stay tensed up.
- Just sit comfortably.

455
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,953
- Comfortably?
- No, no... not that.

456
00:25:22,379 --> 00:25:24,506
- Comfortably?
- No, no... not that. Please.

457
00:25:25,615 --> 00:25:27,010
Hye Jin, not that.
I don't think that'll work.

458
00:25:27,010 --> 00:25:28,521
<i>A little to the back.</i>

459
00:25:29,293 --> 00:25:30,610
- To the back?
- Yes.

460
00:25:31,487 --> 00:25:33,400
- I think you need to straighten up a little.
- Was I being a little too sexy?

461
00:25:33,795 --> 00:25:35,160
Was I being a little too sexy?

462
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:37,287
[Shocks them with her blunt mentality.]

463
00:25:37,407 --> 00:25:38,581
One, two, three.

464
00:25:38,582 --> 00:25:39,803
Wait, wait...

465
00:25:41,289 --> 00:25:44,491
Your mentality really is...
it's a little on the wild side.

466
00:25:44,491 --> 00:25:46,664
- Her mentality is like Sa Yeon's.
- You're a little strong.

467
00:25:47,324 --> 00:25:49,631
Her mentality isn't your norm.

468
00:25:49,632 --> 00:25:51,024
[Not even the slightest bit prudish.
Rather brute and straight forward.]

469
00:25:51,025 --> 00:25:53,630
She doesn't even act flustered,
but says, 'Was I being too sexy?'

470
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:55,530
Are you trying to be a sexy woman?

471
00:25:55,604 --> 00:25:57,692
Hye Jin... I don't think we have to
worry about our communication here.

472
00:25:57,693 --> 00:25:59,512
- Okay.
- And she says, okay!

473
00:25:59,513 --> 00:26:03,073
[Befitting of Queen of talk shows,
she has plenty of confidence!]

474
00:26:03,074 --> 00:26:04,128
From the front.

475
00:26:04,129 --> 00:26:06,644
- From here? That's too far.
- We have to start from here.

476
00:26:06,645 --> 00:26:08,672
[This team is also trying to get started
by giving their guest a ride in their chair.]

477
00:26:09,003 --> 00:26:10,759
Wow... look at how big his feet are!

478
00:26:11,303 --> 00:26:13,605
- He's really tall too.
- He's tall with big feet.

479
00:26:13,606 --> 00:26:15,255
He just has a nice body.

480
00:26:15,256 --> 00:26:18,387
Ji Hyo, on the count of three.
One, two, three!

481
00:26:27,132 --> 00:26:28,504
Right... head to the right!

482
00:26:28,505 --> 00:26:29,952
- Right.
- To the right!

483
00:26:29,953 --> 00:26:31,605
[This is Blank Ji's power!]

484
00:26:37,971 --> 00:26:39,453
- To the right.
- To the right! To the right!

485
00:26:39,731 --> 00:26:41,911
[To the Coliseum!]

486
00:26:43,613 --> 00:26:45,505
One, two, three!

487
00:26:49,524 --> 00:26:52,781
[Who will be the team to take over the
opening mission of the Asia Race?]

488
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:58,295
[Coliseum]

489
00:26:59,276 --> 00:27:01,443
[A sword?]

490
00:27:01,695 --> 00:27:03,525
[Gladiator Dong Wan]

491
00:27:04,658 --> 00:27:07,361
[And a sword?]

492
00:27:10,662 --> 00:27:13,538
[Yellow Team arrives first.]

493
00:27:17,499 --> 00:27:20,274
[Jae Suk and Haroro's lady chair
having struggled to come the distance...]

494
00:27:21,933 --> 00:27:23,128
You worked hard.

495
00:27:25,174 --> 00:27:27,203
[Worrying more for him since
he's still a newlywed?]

496
00:27:27,203 --> 00:27:29,014
You guys will have an advantage
for having come in at first place.

497
00:27:29,015 --> 00:27:30,345
[Their advantage for coming in
at first place is...]

498
00:27:30,693 --> 00:27:34,939
This is none other than...
the first sword that will off the race.

499
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:40,798
[The first sword]

500
00:27:46,633 --> 00:27:50,342
[In that case...]

501
00:27:50,342 --> 00:27:51,854
[Huh?]

502
00:27:55,833 --> 00:27:57,928
What are you normally like?
I'm getting really curious.

503
00:27:57,929 --> 00:28:00,279
- Since we have to be on the same team.
- I can tell you're really blunt.

504
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,801
[Full of curiosity... and not very cautious.]

505
00:28:01,801 --> 00:28:03,631
She's very blunt.
She doesn't hold much back.

506
00:28:04,023 --> 00:28:06,084
- Standing next to her...
- Who would think to do what she did?

507
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:08,649
- On a show like this.
- To think to do that...

508
00:28:09,399 --> 00:28:12,669
- Ji Hyo! We can do this!
- Coliseum is straight ahead.

509
00:28:12,670 --> 00:28:14,528
- Over there... Ji Hyo...
- Coliseum is right up front.

510
00:28:14,528 --> 00:28:17,650
We can do this!
Ji Hyo, just hold on a little longer!

511
00:28:18,009 --> 00:28:19,812
- If this is too much, I can get off.
- No, it's okay.

512
00:28:19,813 --> 00:28:21,889
Song Ji Hyo!
You're better than any other man!

513
00:28:23,311 --> 00:28:25,921
[Ji Hyo... better than any
other two men combined.]

514
00:28:26,323 --> 00:28:28,138
- Ji Hyo... you're not to be messed with.
- Just a little bit more.

515
00:28:28,139 --> 00:28:30,271
- Look, it's Dong Wook.
- Wow...

516
00:28:31,869 --> 00:28:33,802
[Even the Easy Brothers having
wasted their efforts arrives on site.]

517
00:28:33,802 --> 00:28:37,477
- Where do we have to go?
- This will now be your team members.

518
00:28:37,478 --> 00:28:40,069
- This is going to be insane.
- This is all over.

519
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:44,447
<i>Since the game isn't just for the day,
your team members can change at some point.</i>

520
00:28:44,447 --> 00:28:46,263
- Team members can change?
- Really?

521
00:28:46,263 --> 00:28:47,724
<i>There can be a variety of things
that may happen.</i>

522
00:28:47,724 --> 00:28:51,762
<i>As you may already be aware,
I can't tell you how and what may happen.</i>

523
00:28:51,762 --> 00:28:53,147
- Yes, we're very well aware.
- Just give it your best at each game.

524
00:28:53,147 --> 00:28:54,617
Isn't that the fun of Running Man?

525
00:28:55,572 --> 00:28:57,874
Why are you speaking like that?

526
00:28:59,704 --> 00:29:02,983
[Is this Hye Jin's style?
A very straightforward reaction.]

527
00:29:02,984 --> 00:29:05,557
- Seriously... Hye Jin's is no joke.
- I couldn't help you out with that one.

528
00:29:05,558 --> 00:29:08,069
<i>The name of the mission that
you will have to carry out is...</i>

529

530
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:14,143
[The secret of the nine swords]

531
00:29:14,601 --> 00:29:16,178
<i>Please show everyone the sword.</i>

532
00:29:19,935 --> 00:29:22,651
[This is the first sword.]

533
00:29:22,652 --> 00:29:23,837
- There's a number on it.
- Yes, this is one.

534
00:29:23,838 --> 00:29:26,585
- This isn't sharp. It's fake.
- Is there one through nine then?

535
00:29:27,457 --> 00:29:29,915
<i>Along with the sword you've
just seen...</i>

536
00:29:30,243 --> 00:29:35,201
<i>the nine swords are now scattered throughout
Asia for a reason unknown to us.</i>

537
00:29:35,202 --> 00:29:36,817
- Asia?
- Throughout Asia?

538
00:29:37,079 --> 00:29:39,171
Not just Macau, but Asia?

539
00:29:40,406 --> 00:29:42,811
[In order to find all nine swords
that have been separated...]

540
00:29:43,201 --> 00:29:47,935
[Running Man will start their path
down the expansive journey.]

541
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:52,322
[The team to gather all nine of the swords
in their possession is the ultimate winner.]

542
00:29:52,323 --> 00:29:55,017
- I will tell you your next mission location.
- Where is it?

543
00:29:57,051 --> 00:29:59,500
<i>- Macau Tower.
- I saw that earlier.</i>

544
00:30:00,643 --> 00:30:03,049
<i>This is where your next mission
is going to take place.</i>

545
00:30:03,050 --> 00:30:04,367
Wait a minute...

546
00:30:05,187 --> 00:30:08,116
[If it's the Macau Tower...]

547
00:30:08,117 --> 00:30:11,544
I heard that bungee jumping off of
Macau Tower is the tallest in the world.

548
00:30:11,545 --> 00:30:16,020
- To do that, you have a sign a waiver.
- What waiver?

549
00:30:18,342 --> 00:30:21,017
- And I heard they give you a black shirt.
- Why?

550
00:30:21,419 --> 00:30:23,459
Because in China,
black symbolizes death.

551
00:30:24,041 --> 00:30:26,522
- Hey!
- What are you saying right now?

552
00:30:26,523 --> 00:30:28,166
[Saying such a thing so casually...]

553
00:30:28,166 --> 00:30:30,260
I'm just telling you what I've heard.

554
00:30:30,261 --> 00:30:32,043
No, this is just what I heard.

555
00:30:32,044 --> 00:30:35,630
[They can't expect us to do
that bungee jump?]

556

[Off to Macau Tower.]

561
00:30:50,919 --> 00:30:53,608
Kwang Soo is really popular.
Kwang Soo...

562
00:30:54,635 --> 00:30:57,659
[Do they find him fascinating?]

563
00:30:59,117 --> 00:31:02,642
[Asian Prince's popularity
gaining momentum once again.]

564
00:31:03,438 --> 00:31:06,593
[Intoxicated by the popularity.]

565
00:31:10,625 --> 00:31:13,457
[Ah... were they laughing at him?]

566
00:31:14,728 --> 00:31:17,761
<i>Kwang Soo...
you're really popular overseas.</i>

567
00:31:21,736 --> 00:31:24,549
[Giraffe, totally intoxicated by
the level of his popularity.]

568
00:31:27,456 --> 00:31:29,981
Kwang Soo is like
the Prince of the southeast.

569
00:31:29,982 --> 00:31:32,198
They're saying that he's the
Prince of Asia right now.

570
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:34,338
<i>Kwang Soo's the Prince of Asia.</i>

571
00:31:39,102 --> 00:31:42,016
[Something that they never even
dreamed of in the past.]

572
00:31:42,016 --> 00:31:43,856
- Look at all these adorable teenagers.
- They're so cute.

573
00:31:45,032 --> 00:31:46,858
You guys are like their Idols.

574
00:31:52,282 --> 00:31:54,918
- Where?
- Macau Tower... Macau Tower, please.

[Through the streets of Macau-
Off to Macau Tower!]

576

Ji Hyo, you and Dong Wook
are the same age.

577
00:32:04,894 --> 00:32:07,203
- Born in '81.
- Oh, '81?

578
00:32:08,043 --> 00:32:11,067
- I knew that.
- Then let's lower our speech.

579
00:32:11,581 --> 00:32:13,604
Dong Wook... Dong Wook!

580
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:17,560
- This is a little embarrassing.
- It really is embarrassing.

581
00:32:18,431 --> 00:32:20,011
<i>I hope that we can laugh over this...</i>

582
00:32:21,662 --> 00:32:24,781

in Macau.</i>

583

[Countless number of fans
in this location too!]

585

[Flabbergasted by yet another crowd
of fans gathered to greet them.]

586
00:32:45,468 --> 00:32:47,814
Why are there so many people here?

587
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,219
- What is this?
- Oh my gosh!

588
00:32:57,845 --> 00:33:03,645
[This is none other than...
The Macau Tower!]

an unbelievable height!]

- Oh my gosh!</i>

594
00:33:31,452 --> 00:33:36,132
[Looking up at it from the ground
is enough to make them shudder.]

595
00:33:36,132 --> 00:33:37,942
- We're not expected to climb up there?
- This is just absurd.

596
00:33:37,943 --> 00:33:40,123
Hye Jin, take a look at this.

597
00:33:40,124 --> 00:33:42,760

How are we supposed to get up there?</i>

598

600
00:33:49,671 --> 00:33:51,405
No, no way.

601
00:33:51,954 --> 00:33:53,379
Don't even look at that.

602
00:33:55,715 --> 00:33:57,853
[Just looking up at the height is enough
to make their mouth drop open in wonder.]

603
00:33:58,604 --> 00:34:00,346
- What is this?
- That's way too high.

604

[Half excitement, half fear.]

607
00:34:06,435 --> 00:34:09,621
- No way!
- Look at that over there.

608
00:34:14,675 --> 00:34:18,138
- Look at how sweaty your hands are getting!
- Are you going to jump?

609
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:20,191
- Are you nervous because you're jumping?
- No, no way.

610
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:27,098
Are your ears popping too?

611
00:34:27,099 --> 00:34:28,549

three letter word.</i>

all the missions seem just as difficult.]

668
00:38:09,591 --> 00:38:11,963
- Climbing the ladder, or walking around...
- This really is...

669
00:38:11,964 --> 00:38:14,334
I have such phobia of heights.
Even jumping off of 100m...

670
00:38:15,117 --> 00:38:18,330
I really thought it was never going to end.
I thought I was going to pass out.

671
00:38:18,756 --> 00:38:20,680
Let's not do the sky jump.

672
00:38:20,681 --> 00:38:23,191
Let's do the other two of climbing up and
walking around the perimeter.

673
00:38:23,191 --> 00:38:25,151
We can guess the word by
obtaining two of the letters.

674
00:38:25,152 --> 00:38:27,630
- That's the only thing we can do.
- I'm sorry, but I can't do more than that.

675
00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:30,409
I'd gather up the courage to do it if I could,
but this really is...

676
00:38:30,410 --> 00:38:32,865
Then I'll try doing the skywalk first.

677
00:38:32,866 --> 00:38:35,231
- I'll try that first.
- You will, Hye Jin?

678
00:38:35,232 --> 00:38:37,057
[The bravest person on their team.]

679
00:38:37,419 --> 00:38:38,911
You can bungee jump,
can't you, Dong Wook?

680
00:38:38,912 --> 00:38:40,643
- You can bungee jump, can't you?
- I can't do that.

681
00:38:40,644 --> 00:38:44,379
- Dong Wook, that's really unexpected.
- I really can't do things like this.

682
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:47,053
<i>You're supposed to be cool
and show us how it's done.</i>

683
00:38:47,053 --> 00:38:48,872
I'm an entertainer!

684
00:38:49,741 --> 00:38:53,333
- You're an actor!
- I got awarded Rookie of the Year by SBS!

685
00:38:53,334 --> 00:38:55,518
<i>But you're an actor!
Lee Dong Wook...</i>

686
00:38:56,745 --> 00:38:58,740
They're all so scary!

687
00:38:58,741 --> 00:39:00,463
I all of a sudden have the
urge to go poo.

688
00:39:02,022 --> 00:39:04,062
- Me too... I feel like that too.
- My stomach hurts!

689
00:39:04,828 --> 00:39:06,318
What the heck is this?

690
00:39:08,394 --> 00:39:09,637
I'm so scared!

691
00:39:09,638 --> 00:39:11,474
<i>I don't think I can do any of it!</i>

692
00:39:11,475 --> 00:39:13,545
<i>Why did I come here?</i>

693
00:39:14,123 --> 00:39:17,702
- I'll do the skywalk, and you bungee jump.
- I can't do that. I can't bungee jump.

694
00:39:17,703 --> 00:39:20,190
- Suk Jin, that's not it...
- I'll do the skywalk and the climbing...

695
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:21,955
- And you can bungee jump.
- No, I'll do the other two.

696
00:39:23,451 --> 00:39:26,362
- I really can't bungee jump.
- I can't do it either. You think I can?

697
00:39:29,626 --> 00:39:31,035
Feel how hard my heart is beating.

698
00:39:32,099 --> 00:39:37,048
[The men on the Green Team's hearts are
beating like the runaway train.]

699
00:39:40,722 --> 00:39:41,966
Get yourself together!

700
00:39:43,304 --> 00:39:45,456
- This is just a bad dream.
- This is no time for you to be like this.

701
00:39:45,456 --> 00:39:46,862
I'm so glad I'm just a guest.

702
00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:51,610
How about we just guess
what the three letters are?

703
00:39:52,050 --> 00:39:53,479
Answer!
Running Man!

704
00:39:56,142 --> 00:39:59,192
- Macau!
- How about you do the skywalk ten times?

705
00:40:00,206 --> 00:40:03,432
Would you rather walk the skywalk
ten times or bungee jump once?

706
00:40:04,038 --> 00:40:05,920
I'll walk the skywalk ten times.

707
00:40:07,210 --> 00:40:09,668
Why are you seriously being like this?
Get yourself together!

708
00:40:10,702 --> 00:40:12,252
Get yourself together.
What's wrong with you?

709
00:40:12,756 --> 00:40:14,562
What's wrong with you?
Seriously?

710
00:40:15,345 --> 00:40:18,084
[Will it...]

711
00:40:18,084 --> 00:40:23,666
[be even feasible to
complete the mission today?]

712
00:40:26,182 --> 00:40:31,563
[Haroro, having requested the skywalk,
gets fitted for his safety gear.]

713
00:40:31,563 --> 00:40:33,185
Check again, check again.

714
00:40:35,814 --> 00:40:38,062
Kwang Soo, seriously...

715
00:40:38,063 --> 00:40:42,122
[Yellow Team's Jae Suk and
Blue Team's Kwang Soo climbing the mast.]

716
00:40:43,232 --> 00:40:46,469
[Skywalker, Hye Jin,
still feeling pretty steady.]

717
00:40:58,845 --> 00:41:03,161
[It's not as though he can make the
only girl on the team, Ji Hyo to do it...]

718
00:41:03,162 --> 00:41:07,690
[And I don't have the guts to
jump myself...]

719
00:41:08,168 --> 00:41:10,400
Seriously though...

720
00:41:12,428 --> 00:41:14,792
[His psyche is taking a vacation
elsewhere...]

721
00:41:14,793 --> 00:41:16,431
This isn't the time for you to
be spacing out like this right now.

722
00:41:16,432 --> 00:41:18,032
Why do I feel so sleepy?

723
00:41:19,970 --> 00:41:21,124
Skywalk?

724
00:41:21,124 --> 00:41:23,722
[Gary of the Green Team chooses skywalk.
What of the other two members?]

725
00:41:23,722 --> 00:41:26,622
What about the climbing...
you think you can do it?

726
00:41:27,821 --> 00:41:29,158
I'll do the bungee jump.
I'll bungee jump.

727
00:41:29,159 --> 00:41:30,756
I'll do the bungee jump.

728
00:41:31,184 --> 00:41:34,314
[Huh? What did you say?]

729
00:41:34,314 --> 00:41:37,119
[What? Dong Wook
volunteers to bungee jump?]

730
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:38,563
I'll bungee jump.

731
00:41:39,232 --> 00:41:40,376
I'll do it.

732
00:41:41,225 --> 00:41:44,015
You're going to be fine once
you relax a bit.

733
00:41:44,016 --> 00:41:45,993
[Green Team's Lee Dong Wook offers to
do the 233m bungee jump.]

734
00:41:46,397 --> 00:41:47,837
You're going to do the jump?

735
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:50,246
[Immediately becomes big news.]

736
00:41:51,370 --> 00:41:54,229
[Very cool, Lee Dong Wook.]

737
00:41:55,409 --> 00:41:57,344
<i>- Dong Wook...
- Lee Dong Wook!</i>

738
00:41:57,345 --> 00:41:58,923
<i>Lee Dong Wook!</i>

739
00:41:58,923 --> 00:42:01,872
[Even the other team members can't help
but cheer him on and encourage him.]

740
00:42:01,872 --> 00:42:03,181
That's so very cool.

741
00:42:05,082 --> 00:42:06,836
- How much does he weigh?
- 42 kg.

742
00:42:08,370 --> 00:42:11,112
- You don't have to shout that out loud.
- You look like you're out of it.

743
00:42:13,104 --> 00:42:14,890
You look like you're only here physically.

744
00:42:15,411 --> 00:42:19,875
[A chance no one could've predicted!
Will Dong Wook really be able to jump?]

745
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:28,968
<i>I have to climb up even higher than this?</i>

746
00:42:28,969 --> 00:42:30,416
<i>This isn't the top?</i>

747
00:42:31,898 --> 00:42:33,576
Kwang Soo...

748
00:42:33,577 --> 00:42:36,834
Jae Suk... this isn't the top.

749
00:42:36,835 --> 00:42:38,500
Jae Suk, stay strong.

750
00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:42,651
[Need to climb much higher than
the 61st floor observation deck.]

751
00:42:43,614 --> 00:42:46,075
[Where's the end...]

752
00:42:47,665 --> 00:42:49,764
<i>Kwang Soo,
I'll see you when you get back.</i>

753
00:42:51,314 --> 00:42:54,062
[Already gasping for breath after
having climbed up one floor.]

754
00:42:55,164 --> 00:42:57,850
The ladder is perfectly perpendicular.

755
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:05,175
[Ji Hyo reacting as though she's just
seen something very impressive.]

756
00:43:06,192 --> 00:43:07,913
- Don't go, don't go!
- Don't go!

757
00:43:07,914 --> 00:43:09,190
<i>Don't go out there!</i>

758
00:43:11,025 --> 00:43:13,904
- What is this? Ji Hyo!
- What are you doing? Don't go out there!

759
00:43:13,905 --> 00:43:15,346
[The two men keep throwing a fit!]

760
00:43:15,347 --> 00:43:17,960
- Come here... come back here!
- It's just landing over here.

761
00:43:17,961 --> 00:43:20,162
- Come here.
- Hurry up and come back here!

762
00:43:20,163 --> 00:43:21,631
- Come here.
- Just come back here!

763
00:43:21,632 --> 00:43:23,190
- Come on!
- Come here!

764
00:43:23,566 --> 00:43:25,983
[What's wrong with them?]

765
00:43:27,281 --> 00:43:31,418
[These two are having problems with
just standing where they're at.]

766
00:43:32,697 --> 00:43:36,331
- Kwang Soo...
- What have I ever done to deserve this?

767
00:43:37,459 --> 00:43:39,372
What is the big deal about
the three letter word?

768
00:43:40,990 --> 00:43:45,820
[On the other hand,
on top of the observation deck...]

769
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:50,500
[Ha Ha and Hye Jin of the Yellow Team
head out on the skywalk.]

770
00:43:53,104 --> 00:43:59,375
[This is... what you call an aerial walk.]

771
00:43:59,376 --> 00:44:05,048
[The thrill of walking on the catwalk
atop 233m in the air!]

772
00:44:05,049 --> 00:44:06,818
<i>Hye Jin, walk slow.</i>

773
00:44:07,432 --> 00:44:08,850
<i>The problem is...</i>

774
00:44:09,692 --> 00:44:11,494
[Hye Jin walking with confidence and ease.]

775
00:44:11,494 --> 00:44:15,354
[And Ro-Ro walking as though
he's walking towards his death.]

776
00:44:17,024 --> 00:44:19,700
- I'll keep an eye on you, so keep walking.
- Okay.

777
00:44:21,558 --> 00:44:22,813
Mommy...

778
00:44:27,346 --> 00:44:32,078
[Just walking alone is hard enough,
but have to collect all the characters too...]

779
00:44:35,348 --> 00:44:37,295
Hye Jin... wait.

780
00:44:37,296 --> 00:44:41,028
Hye Jin, I'm sorry.
I really do respect you tremendously.

781
00:44:41,029 --> 00:44:44,936
[Haroro looks as though he may even faint
if he doesn't at least hold onto her hand.]

782
00:44:46,467 --> 00:44:50,177
[But just where are these letters?]

783
00:44:50,178 --> 00:44:51,577
<i>It's a miracle in itself
that I'm walking right now.</i>

784
00:44:51,578 --> 00:44:53,710
I'm sorry to say that I'm normally
scared of a lot of things.

785
00:44:53,710 --> 00:44:57,090
I was born a scaredy cat... please!

786
00:44:57,221 --> 00:44:58,403
Hye Jin!

787
00:44:58,404 --> 00:45:00,507
Even though I really like you,
I can really get mad at you!

788
00:45:00,508 --> 00:45:02,987
Don't ever do that to me again.
Seriously!

789
00:45:02,988 --> 00:45:05,535
- I'm serious. You have to promise me.
- Okay, okay.

790
00:45:05,536 --> 00:45:08,499
- Are you looking for the letters?
- I'm looking, but I don't see anything.

791
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:11,326
I really can't look around right now.

792
00:45:11,327 --> 00:45:13,342
- Look over there.
- I can't look.

793
00:45:18,048 --> 00:45:22,403
[Even though they've been around half the
perimeter, still nothing in their sight?]

794
00:45:22,859 --> 00:45:24,143
Why don't I see anything?

795
00:45:24,144 --> 00:45:26,143
I really want to walk like a man too.

796
00:45:26,144 --> 00:45:28,273
I wish I can walk around like a man.

797
00:45:30,284 --> 00:45:34,256
[Relying on the support of a woman's
hand like a real man.]

798
00:45:35,687 --> 00:45:38,935
[Just where are the letters?]

799
00:45:40,291 --> 00:45:43,130
- I think I might faint.
- Why don't I see anything?

800
00:45:44,697 --> 00:45:47,705
I think we've walked around a full circle,
but we haven't found anything.

801
00:45:47,706 --> 00:45:49,639
- We've already walked a full circle?
- Yes.

802
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:52,846
- But how is it that we didn't find anything?
- We need to find it quickly.

803
00:45:52,847 --> 00:45:55,985
[It seems as though they've missed it
during their first round out of fear.]

804
00:45:56,665 --> 00:45:59,428
The letters must be really small.

805
00:46:00,375 --> 00:46:02,275
I wonder if it's written on the floor?

806
00:46:03,315 --> 00:46:05,163
- Hye Jin, you're not scared?
- No, I'm not.

807
00:46:05,999 --> 00:46:08,419
- I think you're going to have to do it again.
- Okay.

808
00:46:08,420 --> 00:46:09,487
Really? You'll do it?

809
00:46:11,511 --> 00:46:13,225
I don't see it.

810
00:46:13,914 --> 00:46:16,243
Where is it?
Can I walk around one more time?

811
00:46:16,846 --> 00:46:19,996
No, no... I can't.
Let's get back inside.

812
00:46:21,647 --> 00:46:24,790
[Green Team's Dong Wook,
moving to the bungee jump diving board.]

813
00:46:24,790 --> 00:46:26,031
<i>I love you, Dong Wook.</i>

814
00:46:26,599 --> 00:46:30,055
- Are you going to jump right now?
- I'm here, but not sure if I can do it.

815
00:46:30,731 --> 00:46:32,024
Wow, you're awesome.

816
00:46:32,297 --> 00:46:34,177
- Wow, that's awesome.
- Fighting.

817
00:46:34,694 --> 00:46:37,831
Running and jump?
And don't stop?

818
00:46:38,461 --> 00:46:41,312
[After saying it out loud,
the visualization of it makes him panic.]

819
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:48,348
- Wait, wait, wait...
- He just has to jump now?

820
00:46:48,890 --> 00:46:53,579
[Going back and forth on his decision
every five seconds.]

821
00:46:54,938 --> 00:46:56,194
This is really scary.

822
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:58,746
<i>Fighting!
You can do it, Dong Wook!</i>

823
00:46:58,747 --> 00:47:02,897
[Everyone is cheering Dong Wook on
regardless of which team he's on!]

824
00:47:02,898 --> 00:47:05,293
- You're burdening me. Stop it.
- Okay, we'll stop.

825
00:47:07,502 --> 00:47:11,736
[Okay... he is standing on the platform...]

826
00:47:13,136 --> 00:47:15,204
<i>Okay, just jump as far out
as you can.</i>

827
00:47:19,078 --> 00:47:21,706
[Empty... the mind...]

828
00:47:24,416 --> 00:47:27,481
- Set... go...
- Wait... wait...

829
00:47:27,902 --> 00:47:30,516
[Calls for a halt
as soon as the countdown starts.]

830
00:47:33,432 --> 00:47:36,065
- Slow... let's take this slow.
- My legs are shaking.

831
00:47:40,765 --> 00:47:42,736
He's really frightened right now.

832
00:47:42,737 --> 00:47:44,299
- That has to be scary.
- I'm sure he's scared.

833
00:47:45,932 --> 00:47:47,038
<i>You can do it!</i>

834
00:47:51,136 --> 00:47:52,600
<i>Lee Dong Woo, fighting.
Lee Dong Wook, fighting!</i>

835
00:47:58,338 --> 00:47:59,620
Okay.

836
00:48:00,270 --> 00:48:04,122
[Dong Wook completes
his preparation for the jump!]

837
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:08,268
<i>Look at the walls of the building as you jump.
You'll see letters written on it.</i>

838
00:48:09,484 --> 00:48:11,416
What... what did you say?

839
00:48:12,944 --> 00:48:14,428
<i>Are you ready?</i>

840
00:48:14,822 --> 00:48:15,870
Yes.

841
00:48:16,694 --> 00:48:18,945
[Completes the preparation to jump once
more after having calmed himself down!]

842
00:48:18,945 --> 00:48:22,952
[Countdown]

843
00:48:22,952 --> 00:48:26,024
[Calls for a halt once again.]

844
00:48:28,645 --> 00:48:29,741
I seriously understand.

845
00:48:30,523 --> 00:48:35,437
[Will be really be able to jump?]

846
00:48:35,437 --> 00:48:39,445
[I don't want to regret not jumping...]

847
00:48:40,783 --> 00:48:42,278
- Go!
- Okay!

848
00:48:42,915 --> 00:48:45,578
[Countdown]

849
00:48:45,578 --> 00:48:49,125
[In the midst of all their encouragement...]

850
00:48:49,883 --> 00:48:54,216
[Dong Wook, taking on the challenge of the
tallest bungee jump in the world at 233m!]

851
00:48:54,217 --> 00:48:56,167
<i>Fighting!</i>

852
00:48:57,572 --> 00:48:59,404
Running Man, fighting!

853
00:49:28,303 --> 00:49:29,972
Running Man, fighting!

854
00:49:35,262 --> 00:49:42,573
[Up in the air at 233m...
I throw myself into the sky...]

855
00:49:53,446 --> 00:49:57,835
[Very first bungee jump
experience of my life...]

856
00:50:20,071 --> 00:50:24,730
[The fact of 233m being the highest
in the world isn't what's important...]

857
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:29,920
[But the satisfaction of knowing
that I won against my own fear...]

858
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:31,367
This is amazing.

859
00:50:38,381 --> 00:50:40,744
[A scenery that the onlookers
are having a tough time believing.]

860
00:50:49,954 --> 00:50:53,481
[Dong Wook succeeds at the tallest
bungee jump in the world at 233m!]

861
00:50:54,746 --> 00:50:56,499
Where's the letter?

862
00:50:59,166 --> 00:51:01,247
[Oh?]

863
00:51:01,247 --> 00:51:04,281
[He discovers the letter!]

864
00:51:05,610 --> 00:51:07,758
'Na'? What does 'Na' stand for?
'Na'?

865
00:51:08,796 --> 00:51:13,170
[Green Team succeeds in obtaining
one of the three letters!]

866
00:51:18,062 --> 00:51:22,308
[An enthusiastic welcome by the local fans
to uplift his spirits!]

867
00:51:26,674 --> 00:51:28,386
[I did it!]

868
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:30,844
[Envious...]

869
00:51:32,326 --> 00:51:35,080
Awesome...
that was so cool... so cool.

870
00:51:38,060 --> 00:51:40,446
[A bow in thanks to the fans
for their encouragement.]

871
00:51:47,086 --> 00:51:51,140
[And up in the observation deck,
they can keep watch through the screen.]

872
00:51:53,090 --> 00:51:54,910
Dong Wook, you're the best!

873
00:51:55,716 --> 00:51:57,700
Why do I suddenly feel like a loser?

874
00:51:59,009 --> 00:52:02,106
[Even though that was awesome,
I still can't do it...]

875
00:52:03,930 --> 00:52:06,884
[On the other hand,
as for the mast climbers...]

876
00:52:07,832 --> 00:52:10,911
[Ace Ji Hyo is the only one who
keeps on climbing up without any hesitation.]

877
00:52:12,068 --> 00:52:14,300
I'll just call you 'Sis' from now on
since you're more courageous than I.

878
00:52:14,300 --> 00:52:15,513
And I'll call you 'Mom'.

879
00:52:17,301 --> 00:52:19,738
But this is much harder than I expected.

880
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:25,415
[With each floor that they climb up,
Kwang Soo and Jae Suk screams out in fear.]

881
00:52:25,415 --> 00:52:27,594
Why do you keep screaming, Jae Suk?

882
00:52:27,595 --> 00:52:29,888
You still have a long ways to go.

883
00:52:31,700 --> 00:52:33,771
Kwang Soo, I'm seriously...

884
00:52:34,626 --> 00:52:36,033
so scared!

885
00:52:37,776 --> 00:52:42,413
[Kwang Soo is in a trance like state
with his eyes fixed straight forward.]

886
00:52:42,471 --> 00:52:44,858
Jae Suk...
I feel like I'm going to lose my mind.

887
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:48,708
Where is the top?

888
00:52:48,708 --> 00:52:52,117
[Still a long ways to go...]

889
00:52:53,134 --> 00:52:55,077
Jae Suk, I...

890
00:52:56,479 --> 00:52:58,269
I just...

891
00:52:59,861 --> 00:53:02,631
- Can I just do something else?
- What else are you going to do?

892
00:53:02,632 --> 00:53:05,007
You're not going to say
bungee jump, are you?

893
00:53:05,008 --> 00:53:07,026
Ji Hyo, this is better.
Even if this is tiring, this is still better.

894
00:53:07,027 --> 00:53:08,961
Jae Suk, I'm getting so drowsy
right now.

895
00:53:08,961 --> 00:53:11,679
I think bungee humping would be better.
Just get it over with in one jump.

896
00:53:12,057 --> 00:53:13,965
[Unable to comprehend.]

897
00:53:14,517 --> 00:53:18,440
I'm going to end it in one shot,
so let's you and I make a deal.

898
00:53:18,963 --> 00:53:20,487
What kind of a deal?

899
00:53:21,037 --> 00:53:24,002
None of your team members are
going to jump anyway, right?

900
00:53:24,342 --> 00:53:26,336
- But you still need the bungee letter.
- Yes, I need it.

901
00:53:26,337 --> 00:53:30,745
[Exchange bungee letter for
the mast letter.]

902
00:53:30,745 --> 00:53:32,384
I'll take that deal.

903
00:53:32,777 --> 00:53:35,726
[Sensing the attractiveness of the deal,
they're competing for the contract.]

904
00:53:35,726 --> 00:53:37,429
I'll use this helmet somehow
to notify you of what's going on.

905
00:53:37,430 --> 00:53:39,990
- Then, I'll just...
- Okay, go on down.

906
00:53:39,991 --> 00:53:43,440
I'm going to go down and
see how you two handle it.

907
00:53:43,441 --> 00:53:45,981
- I promise to work hard and get it done.
- I will do whatever it takes.

908
00:53:45,982 --> 00:53:47,492
- Don't worry about a thing.
- You promise?

909
00:53:47,493 --> 00:53:49,148
- Yes, of course.
- Really?

910
00:53:49,149 --> 00:53:50,334
Are you sure you can
handle the bungee?

911
00:53:50,334 --> 00:53:53,300
If anything, I'm seriously
about to fall asleep right now.

912
00:53:53,301 --> 00:53:54,817
You really are something else.

913
00:53:54,817 --> 00:53:58,562
People may say whatever about Jong Kook,
but you really are the best.

914
00:53:58,562 --> 00:53:59,813
You really are the top dog here.

915
00:54:01,378 --> 00:54:07,333
[At the same time, Gary of the
Green Team is walking the skywalk.]

916
00:54:07,334 --> 00:54:08,763
<i>I really hope I find it on my first try.</i>

917
00:54:10,109 --> 00:54:15,382
[After having tried the skywalk himself,
realizes just how high up he really is.]

918
00:54:17,435 --> 00:54:18,545
Oh? What's that?

919
00:54:18,546 --> 00:54:19,645
What's that?

920
00:54:19,646 --> 00:54:22,595
[Huh? What is that piece of
paper up there?]

921
00:54:24,470 --> 00:54:26,605
Even if I jump,
I don't think I can reach that.

922
00:54:27,034 --> 00:54:28,631
Gary, you can do it.
You can do it!

923
00:54:28,632 --> 00:54:32,211
[Having transformed into a preacher
of self-confidence after his bungee jump.]

924
00:54:35,294 --> 00:54:36,362
<i>Try jumping.</i>

925
00:54:42,276 --> 00:54:44,353
What the heck am I doing out here?

926
00:54:45,630 --> 00:54:47,093
[100% sympathetic of his situation.]

927
00:54:47,093 --> 00:54:48,296
It's really scary out there.

928
00:54:49,291 --> 00:54:52,046
[Trying the jump one more time.]

929
00:54:52,798 --> 00:54:54,024
Two...

930
00:54:55,946 --> 00:54:57,881
<i>- It's like he's bungee jumping.
- Look at how scared...</i>

931
00:54:59,838 --> 00:55:02,156
[Too bad...]

932
00:55:03,656 --> 00:55:05,601
I can't reach it!
This is up way too high!

933
00:55:09,050 --> 00:55:11,164
<i>Don't move!
Just stay right there!</i>

934
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:12,717
Just stay right there!

935
00:55:28,112 --> 00:55:30,250
[Oh! He did it!]

936
00:55:30,251 --> 00:55:31,362
I got it, I got it.

937
00:55:31,654 --> 00:55:34,024
[The piece of paper shows...]

938
00:55:34,024 --> 00:55:37,004
[the character, 'Ae'!]

939
00:55:37,005 --> 00:55:41,154
[Green Team earns a character
from the skywalk!]

940
00:55:42,076 --> 00:55:46,010
[Now, he has to find the other character
to complete the letter.]

941
00:55:47,811 --> 00:55:49,232
Wow...

942
00:55:50,635 --> 00:55:51,991
We're up really high!

943
00:55:51,992 --> 00:55:55,031
I've always wanted to live up high...

944
00:55:55,459 --> 00:55:56,908
but I like the ground.

945
00:55:57,246 --> 00:56:00,224
Human beings need to live with
their feet planted on the ground.

946
00:56:00,225 --> 00:56:01,849
I don't think this is right.

947
00:56:03,003 --> 00:56:05,451
[Checks below the catwalk.]

948
00:56:11,845 --> 00:56:14,389
[A piece of paper?]

949
00:56:14,390 --> 00:56:20,087
[There it is!
A piece of paper hanging off the rail!]

950
00:56:22,184 --> 00:56:25,006
[He can see it, but how is he...]

951
00:56:28,265 --> 00:56:30,923
[Life sure isn't easy...]

952
00:56:33,966 --> 00:56:36,433
[Trying to ease away his fears
by forcing himself to sing.]

953
00:56:45,003 --> 00:56:47,586
[Gary succeeds in getting the
piece of paper!]

954
00:56:49,381 --> 00:56:55,719
[And on this piece of paper...
'sae' is written on it!]

955
00:56:56,344 --> 00:56:57,964
I found it... I found it!

956
00:56:59,309 --> 00:57:01,344
I came so that I may have you!

957
00:57:01,345 --> 00:57:02,606
Goodbye!

958
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:04,361
<i>Goodbye!</i>

959
00:57:04,361 --> 00:57:06,456
Wait... what were they again?
Remember.

960
00:57:07,948 --> 00:57:11,087
[Discovered two characters
to make up a letter.]

961
00:57:11,272 --> 00:57:16,492
[Green Team discovered the letter,
'Sae' out on the skywalk!]

962
00:57:18,242 --> 00:57:21,966
[On the other hand,
up on the bungee jumping board...]

963
00:57:23,018 --> 00:57:24,413
<i>Are you ready?</i>

964
00:57:24,414 --> 00:57:25,647
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

965
00:57:27,406 --> 00:57:31,074
[Totally blasé Ace
without even a trace of nervousness.]

966
00:57:32,151 --> 00:57:35,043
Seriously... I'm seriously proud
to be on your team.

967
00:57:35,409 --> 00:57:37,744
- We're not on the same team.
- The fact that we're both members of RM.

968
00:57:37,745 --> 00:57:38,992
<i>I feel proud too.</i>

969
00:57:40,218 --> 00:57:41,694
But if I can wish for something...

970
00:57:41,695 --> 00:57:44,362
it would be that you at least
take the same amount of time that I did.

971
00:57:48,061 --> 00:57:51,052
[If Ji Hyo jumps at once,
then Dong Wook won't look as cool...]

972
00:57:52,236 --> 00:57:55,028
[Releasing the final safety clasp.]

973
00:57:55,028 --> 00:57:58,513
- Just a moment...
- The helicam...

974
00:57:59,123 --> 00:58:02,917
[The ease with which she waits for
the aircam to be ready to start filming.]

975
00:58:04,884 --> 00:58:07,902
[The helicam finally arrives!]

976
00:58:08,010 --> 00:58:11,937
[Helicam is ready to film Ji Hyo's jump!]

977
00:58:13,821 --> 00:58:17,934
<i>Song Ji Hyo!
Song Ji Hyo!</i>

978
00:58:17,935 --> 00:58:21,435
[All her fans sending her extra bit
of courage through their cheering.]

979
00:58:22,978 --> 00:58:26,629
[Ace Ji Hyo completes her preparation
for the jump!]

980
00:58:26,629 --> 00:58:30,600
[Countdown]

981
00:58:32,857 --> 00:58:36,994
[The only female member of Running Man,
and at the same time, Running Man's Ace!]

982
00:58:40,344 --> 00:58:45,238
[She is... flying!]

983
00:59:01,865 --> 00:59:05,544
[Ji Hyo takes flight!]

984
00:59:06,046 --> 00:59:07,499
Ji Hyo!

985
00:59:08,952 --> 00:59:11,034
[Without even
the slightest bit of hesitation...]

986
00:59:11,034 --> 00:59:14,318
[Just jumps into the air.]

987
00:59:18,740 --> 00:59:21,362
[Just enjoying the freedom the highest
bungee jump in the world has to offer.]

988
00:59:28,477 --> 00:59:30,491
Wow! This is so much fun!

989
00:59:32,985 --> 00:59:37,176
[Ace Ji Hyo, succeeds the
233m bungee jump!]

990
00:59:41,187 --> 00:59:42,600
This is awesome!

991
00:59:43,510 --> 00:59:46,371
[Even ten men combined together
can't compare to her!]

992
00:59:47,692 --> 00:59:49,326
She really is amazing!

993
00:59:52,796 --> 00:59:54,840
What an amazing woman!

994
00:59:56,764 --> 01:00:01,946
[Verifies that 'Na' is the letter she'll trade
the other team for as per her agreement.]

995
01:00:14,336 --> 01:00:16,404
Since she jumped at once like that...

996
01:00:16,404 --> 01:00:18,023
I don't feel as good about my jump
as I did earlier.

997
01:00:18,802 --> 01:00:22,003
- She really is something else.
- She's on a whole different scale.

998
01:00:22,004 --> 01:00:23,282
[The first time is always the hardest.]

999
01:00:23,283 --> 01:00:25,564
<i>Blank Ji!</i>

1000
01:00:34,072 --> 01:00:39,541
[She really is without a doubt...
our precious Ace...]

1001
01:00:40,412 --> 01:00:42,738
[At the same time...]

1002
01:00:45,022 --> 01:00:50,035
[One man without
a single thought in his head.]

1003
01:00:50,035 --> 01:00:53,428
[No, make that two men.]

1004
01:00:54,588 --> 01:00:58,231
[Both having been stuck in the same
position and spot for the past 20 minutes.]

1005
01:00:58,232 --> 01:00:59,774
I'm so scared right now.

1006
01:01:00,481 --> 01:01:03,730
[Will they... be able to see the letter?]

1007
01:01:03,731 --> 01:01:06,018
- She's back!
- Ji Hyo!

1008
01:01:06,019 --> 01:01:07,925
- Ji Hyo, are you okay?
- Was it fun?

1009
01:01:07,925 --> 01:01:10,040
- You weren't scared?
- It was so much fun!

1010
01:01:10,040 --> 01:01:12,060
- It was fun?
- It was totally fun!

1011
01:01:14,165 --> 01:01:16,754
The moment I started thinking it was
taking awhile to fall, it was over.

1012
01:01:16,754 --> 01:01:19,068
You really are something else.

1013
01:01:19,399 --> 01:01:21,325
But there was something that
I was reminded of at that moment.

1014
01:01:21,852 --> 01:01:25,193
I wondered if maybe I looked too
unattractive because I jumped too readily.

1015
01:01:26,109 --> 01:01:28,521
<i>Actually, Dong Wook felt that way
because you made the jump look too easy.</i>

1016
01:01:28,522 --> 01:01:30,457
<i>Don't worry about things like that!
You were amazing.</i>

1017
01:01:30,458 --> 01:01:31,934
<i>What kind of a woman is this?</i>

1018
01:01:31,935 --> 01:01:33,641
<i>She really is worthy of my liking.</i>

1019
01:01:35,060 --> 01:01:37,088
I am kind of curious...

1020
01:01:37,525 --> 01:01:40,565
[Huh?
Is Hye Jin showing some interest?]

1021
01:01:40,566 --> 01:01:43,610
Since a couple of people have jumped,
I bet it looks exciting.

1022
01:01:43,610 --> 01:01:47,533
Having watched them jump,
it's starting to look easier now.

1023
01:01:48,005 --> 01:01:52,008
- Decision time, decision time...
- It's really fun.

1024
01:01:52,630 --> 01:01:55,192
If you jump,
our team gets all three letters.

1025
01:01:55,193 --> 01:01:58,277
- Then you're going to do the other one?
- I'll get it done somehow, someway.

1026
01:01:58,858 --> 01:01:59,918
I'll seriously do it.

1027
01:01:59,918 --> 01:02:03,149
[Hm... should I?]

1028
01:02:04,496 --> 01:02:07,024
[A moment later]

1029
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:10,641
This is scary.

1030
01:02:12,164 --> 01:02:16,345
- It's scarier if you hesitate.
- Just do it.

1031
01:02:17,185 --> 01:02:21,393
- But where's Ha Ha?
- He went off to do his mission.

1032
01:02:21,394 --> 01:02:24,627
[Went off to do the skywalk mission so that
he can accomplish something of his own.]

1033
01:02:33,076 --> 01:02:36,615
Just keep the eyes on the paper, and jump.
One, two, three.

1034
01:02:36,616 --> 01:02:37,840
Okay!

1035
01:02:37,841 --> 01:02:41,906
[Catching the piece of paper with 'Ae'
written on it in one try!]

1036
01:02:42,695 --> 01:02:45,408
I'm a man... I'm a man!

1037
01:02:45,409 --> 01:02:47,775
[Good for you...]

1038
01:02:49,290 --> 01:02:50,663
I'm not afraid!

1039
01:02:51,057 --> 01:02:53,406
I'm going to be a cool dad!

1040
01:02:55,141 --> 01:02:56,839
How in the world am I to do this?

1041
01:03:02,873 --> 01:03:06,503
[Ultimately gets down flat on his belly.]

1042
01:03:14,514 --> 01:03:18,228
[Automatically keeps
breaking down in sobs.]

1043
01:03:21,455 --> 01:03:23,799
Seo Young... got it!
I got it!

1044
01:03:24,011 --> 01:03:26,304
[Barely manages to succeed
in getting the paper!]

1045
01:03:30,192 --> 01:03:32,419
[Checks that the second character
is, 'Sae'.]

1046
01:03:34,809 --> 01:03:39,065
I'm so scared I'm going to fall off this!
Don't ever... don't ever do this again!

1047
01:03:40,894 --> 01:03:45,618
[Haroro having done his share of the work
for Hye Jin who's gone off to bungee jump.]

1048
01:03:46,089 --> 01:03:48,854
<i>Hye Jin!
Hye Jin, I did it!</i>

1049
01:03:48,855 --> 01:03:50,264
You did it?

1050
01:03:50,265 --> 01:03:52,016
Hye Jin, you're so cool!

1051
01:03:52,017 --> 01:03:54,050
Hye Jin, you're my hero!
Aren't you scared?

1052
01:03:54,443 --> 01:03:56,927
- I'm so scared!
- You can do it, Hye Jin!

1053
01:03:56,928 --> 01:03:58,435
<i>Hye Jin, you're my hero!</i>

1054
01:03:58,435 --> 01:04:01,555
You're the leader of 'healing camp',
and the icon of courage.

1055
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:04,076
Open the door.

1056
01:04:05,991 --> 01:04:09,364
[Speaking in gibberish... doesn't
seem to be quite sane at the moment.]

1057
01:04:09,364 --> 01:04:11,309
Did you get it?
Did you get the letter?

1058
01:04:11,310 --> 01:04:13,540
Suk Jin... I'm serious when
I tell you this.

1059
01:04:13,540 --> 01:04:16,402
I only did it because I thought if I didn't,
I wouldn't be respected as a human being.

1060
01:04:17,464 --> 01:04:19,423
I had to do something since
Han Hye Jin is doing all this.

1061
01:04:19,945 --> 01:04:22,862
[Han Hye Jin's first bungee jump
attempt of her life!]

1062
01:04:22,863 --> 01:04:25,164
Han Hye Jin, fighting!

1063
01:04:25,165 --> 01:04:28,243
- Han Hye Jin, fighting!
- I'm so scared!

1064
01:04:30,258 --> 01:04:34,633
[I can't even ride the rollercoasters
at the amusement parks...]

1065
01:04:34,633 --> 01:04:38,117
[Will I be able to do the highest
bungee jump in the world?]

1066
01:04:40,968 --> 01:04:46,332
[Without any hesitation...
just trust in myself.]

1067
01:05:02,133 --> 01:05:06,818
[Her beautiful challenge...]

1068
01:05:20,710 --> 01:05:22,884
[The fear is only for a moment...]

1069
01:05:24,694 --> 01:05:27,909
[Even the toughest part only
lasts a moment...]

1070
01:05:31,042 --> 01:05:36,281
[And after that,
you're left with nothing but a smile.]

1071
01:05:38,178 --> 01:05:41,953
[All the men made to feel even smaller
with this turn of events.]

1072
01:05:42,829 --> 01:05:44,012
Amazing!

1073
01:05:51,944 --> 01:05:53,864
I'm so happy...

1074
01:05:55,655 --> 01:06:00,400
[Hye Jin succeeds at the
233m bungee jump!]

1075
01:06:07,161 --> 01:06:09,804
[And even verifies that the letter from
the bungee jump is 'Na'.]

1076
01:06:09,805 --> 01:06:10,827
Na?

1077
01:06:12,151 --> 01:06:13,737
That was fun.

1078
01:06:16,569 --> 01:06:20,495
[On the other hand, at the tippy top of
the tower where time has stood still.]

1079
01:06:20,784 --> 01:06:26,508
<i>If you climb this ladder up to the top,
you'll see a blue piece of paper to the right.</i>

1080
01:06:26,508 --> 01:06:30,652
<i>If you scrape off the paper with a coin,
you'll see the letter underneath it.</i>

1081
01:06:30,653 --> 01:06:33,488
<i>So I'm going to give you the coin
you're going to be using right now.</i>

1082
01:06:33,488 --> 01:06:38,488
<i>Use this coin to scratch off the surface,
and come back down once you see the letter.</i>

1083
01:06:38,489 --> 01:06:41,824
[The road just keeps on getting harder...]

1084
01:06:42,622 --> 01:06:44,723
<i>You have to scratch off the surface
in order to see the letter.</i>

1085
01:06:46,825 --> 01:06:49,488
[Is it really that necessary to
bite down on the coin like that?]

1086
01:06:51,620 --> 01:06:52,836
<i>Be careful.</i>

1087
01:06:55,306 --> 01:06:57,076
Jae Suk, are your eyes open?

1088
01:06:57,872 --> 01:06:59,048
Jae Suk.

1089
01:06:59,049 --> 01:07:00,674
<i>Jae Suk...</i>

1090
01:07:14,920 --> 01:07:16,066
<i>Jae Suk...</i>

1091
01:07:18,212 --> 01:07:19,546
Please...

1092
01:07:24,166 --> 01:07:27,456
[Discovers the letter, 'Doh'.]

1093
01:07:29,767 --> 01:07:31,497
[I... survived.]

1094
01:07:33,612 --> 01:07:36,983
[Now it's Kwang Soo's turn
from the Blue Team.]

1095
01:07:37,210 --> 01:07:39,425
<i>Kwang Soo, you can't stop.
Just keep climbing.</i>

1096
01:07:40,202 --> 01:07:41,944
<i>Kwang Soo,
don't stop and keep going.</i>

1097
01:07:43,505 --> 01:07:44,906
<i>Kwang Soo...</i>

1098
01:07:46,139 --> 01:07:50,217
[His face looks as if it's aged several years
during this mission.]

1099
01:07:57,367 --> 01:08:00,121
[Finally barely makes it up to the spot.]

1100
01:08:05,891 --> 01:08:09,070
[By using every ounce of energy
he possesses in his body...]

1101
01:08:10,868 --> 01:08:13,560
Why stick this up here upside down?

1102
01:08:20,406 --> 01:08:22,800
<i>You can spit the coin back out now.</i>

1103
01:08:28,232 --> 01:08:30,276
<i>Did you both see the letter?</i>

1104
01:08:30,277 --> 01:08:31,918
Yes, I saw it.

1105
01:08:31,919 --> 01:08:33,904
<i>You don't need to go back up, right?</i>

1106
01:08:34,272 --> 01:08:36,259
[That's not even funny...]

1107
01:08:37,538 --> 01:08:42,713
[Each teams starts to guess what
the three letter word is with their letters.]

1108
01:08:44,841 --> 01:08:46,710
- 'Na'... 'Na'.
- 'Na'?

1109
01:08:46,711 --> 01:08:48,713
I got 'Sae'.

1110
01:08:49,788 --> 01:08:51,063
What could it be?

1111
01:08:52,609 --> 01:08:56,126
[Blue Team mission one letter with there
only being two members to their team.]

1112
01:08:57,912 --> 01:09:00,518
Suk Jin, you can do this!
Suk Jin, Suk Jin...

1113
01:09:05,322 --> 01:09:06,419
'Sae'...

1114
01:09:07,687 --> 01:09:11,112
[Anyways, all three of the teams
completed the mission!]

1115
01:09:12,799 --> 01:09:15,284
[Blank...]

1116
01:09:16,661 --> 01:09:22,640
[The two mast climbers who took quite
some time to climb down from the top.]

1117
01:09:25,370 --> 01:09:26,383
Are you okay?

1118
01:09:26,384 --> 01:09:30,593
[Per their deal,
a mast letter for the bungee letter.]

1119
01:09:30,740 --> 01:09:35,702
[They must correctly guess the word
in order to gain the second dagger!]

1120
01:09:36,129 --> 01:09:37,836
<i>I need to hear what it is.</i>

1121
01:09:37,837 --> 01:09:40,071
<i>Us too.
Did you hear what it is?</i>

1122
01:09:40,871 --> 01:09:46,763
[As soon as the deal is made,
breaks out into a full powered run!]

1123
01:09:46,763 --> 01:09:50,481
[The first team to guess the word
correctly wins the dagger!]

1124
01:09:54,670 --> 01:09:56,580
[Green Team is the first to arrive!]

1125
01:09:58,321 --> 01:10:00,129
<i>- Hurry!
- I need the correct answer.</i>

1126
01:10:00,130 --> 01:10:02,555
[Jae Suk, without any energy to run.]

1127
01:10:02,556 --> 01:10:03,848
<i>Everyone needs to get in line.</i>

1128
01:10:03,848 --> 01:10:07,046
[What is the three letter word?]

1129
01:10:07,046 --> 01:10:09,831
- I found the letter, 'Sae' on the skywalk.
- Then the letter, 'Na' on the jump.

1130
01:10:09,831 --> 01:10:12,946
And... from the mast climb,
the letter, 'Doh'.

1131
01:10:12,947 --> 01:10:16,070
- But what's the word?
- We know what it is!

1132
01:10:17,396 --> 01:10:19,606
Senado.

1133
01:10:20,370 --> 01:10:21,708
Correct.

1134
01:10:21,709 --> 01:10:24,326
[The correct answer is,
'Senado Square' in Macau.]

1135
01:10:24,327 --> 01:10:27,574
[Green Team wins the
Macau Tower mission.]

1136
01:10:31,342 --> 01:10:34,451
[The second dagger goes to
the Green Team.]

1137
01:10:35,860 --> 01:10:38,442
<i>This place... Senado Square.
We can just head over, right?</i>

1138
01:10:38,443 --> 01:10:40,044
- Go!
- Okay!

1139
01:10:43,294 --> 01:10:46,099
- Senado Square.
- Is it Senado Square?

1140
01:10:46,100 --> 01:10:48,688
[Yellow Team is also cleared to go!]

1141
01:10:48,689 --> 01:10:50,070
I'll see you later, Kwang Soo.

1142
01:10:52,166 --> 01:10:54,210
It's Senado Square.

1143
01:11:00,506 --> 01:11:04,457
[At some point,
darkness comes finds its way over Macau]

1144
01:11:07,609 --> 01:11:09,321
- It's just a cylindrical barrel.
- Oh my goodness...

1145
01:11:09,321 --> 01:11:12,323
It's that thing over there!
Look at that thing!

1146
01:11:12,818 --> 01:11:14,466
See that thing on top?

1147
01:11:14,467 --> 01:11:17,107
[From here... and even higher.]

1148
01:11:17,108 --> 01:11:21,052
Where you see the disc is where you were,
and I had to climb up even higher to the top!

1149
01:11:21,053 --> 01:11:24,605
Where you see the twinkling light up top
is where I had to go!

1150
01:11:24,855 --> 01:11:28,448
Ha Ha, look over there.
Do you see the dotted lights up top?

1151
01:11:28,449 --> 01:11:31,028
- Yes, I see the light twinkling.
- That's where I had to go!

1152
01:11:31,586 --> 01:11:35,328
- That is just absurd...
- I seriously thought I was going insane.

1153
01:11:35,328 --> 01:11:37,584
I went all the way to the top
where you see the antenna.

1154
01:11:39,152 --> 01:11:42,144
While... no one is around to see it,
just cry and get it all out.

1155
01:11:52,084 --> 01:11:56,240
I was totally deceived!
Kwang Soo and I were totally deceived!

1156
01:11:56,241 --> 01:11:57,472
[In an attempt to avoid the height,
got dragged away to an even higher spot.]

1157
01:11:57,472 --> 01:12:01,271
You know those people who climb up those
heights with a smile on their faces?

1158
01:12:01,272 --> 01:12:02,950
You know how they have those
picture displayed on the walls?

1159
01:12:02,951 --> 01:12:04,984
They're all computer graphics.
I swear that they are.

1160
01:12:04,985 --> 01:12:06,552
[He can swear that they're edited?]

1161
01:12:06,553 --> 01:12:10,546
I'm positive they edited the smiling face
over these panicked looking people's faces.

1162
01:12:10,547 --> 01:12:12,129
So they just dragged the sides of the lips up
to make it look like they're smiling?

1163
01:12:12,129 --> 01:12:14,170
Not crying is the miracle.
If people don't cry from that, it's a miracle.

1164
01:12:14,773 --> 01:12:16,984
[Still sobbing]

1165
01:12:21,451 --> 01:12:24,217
[The sounds of Jae Suk's cries resonating
through Macau's night skies.]

1166
01:12:24,718 --> 01:12:26,018
Senado?

1167
01:12:27,461 --> 01:12:29,314
I wonder what we're going to do there?

1168
01:12:29,715 --> 01:12:33,045
Since it's supposed to be a square,
I'm sure it'll be a bigger place.

1169
01:12:33,046 --> 01:12:34,360
[What kind of a mission will
await them at this square?]

1170
01:12:35,430 --> 01:12:37,732
[Senado Square and its surroundings.]

1171
01:12:38,604 --> 01:12:40,740
[Macau's national heritage site as well as...]

1172
01:12:40,740 --> 01:12:42,313
[being the number one attraction in Macau
is famous for its jerky stalls.]

1173
01:12:42,313 --> 01:12:47,918
[And next to that is the beautiful
St. Paul's Cathedral.]

1174
01:12:47,918 --> 01:12:52,246
[What is the mission that awaits
them at this location?]

1175
01:12:52,990 --> 01:12:54,946
[On the other hand...]

1176
01:12:55,955 --> 01:12:59,949
[At Hong Kong International Airport...]

1177
01:13:00,196 --> 01:13:04,107
[Did someone just land?]

1178
01:13:04,107 --> 01:13:07,917
[Mr. Capable, Jong Kook.]

1179
01:13:15,054 --> 01:13:17,753
What are you doing here?
I can't believe that you're here.

1180
01:13:18,262 --> 01:13:21,434
[Kkuk having landed in Hong Kong...]

1181
01:13:22,807 --> 01:13:26,302
[He needs to start making his way
towards Macau...]

1182
01:13:27,532 --> 01:13:31,591
[But somehow, his fans are aware of his
arrival and scattered throughout the place.]

1183
01:13:31,592 --> 01:13:32,883
Bye, thank you.

1184
01:13:34,214 --> 01:13:36,696
[Have a safe trip to Macau!]

1185
01:13:38,497 --> 01:13:40,647
[And through the warm hospitality
of his Hong Kong fans...]

1186
01:13:44,422 --> 01:13:46,087
I'm to take that helicopter?

1187
01:13:47,380 --> 01:13:50,647
[Let's get you there quickly and
start shooting the show...]

1188
01:13:52,542 --> 01:13:54,769
[Boarding the helicopter.]

1189
01:13:56,342 --> 01:14:00,744
[Beautiful night skies of Hong Kong.]

1190
01:14:06,796 --> 01:14:08,044
Anyway...

1191
01:14:08,450 --> 01:14:11,768
I wonder how much they're all going to
tease me about my injured foot.

1192
01:14:13,301 --> 01:14:15,989
[No way for Mr. Capable to save
his face on that one!]

1193
01:14:19,491 --> 01:14:22,755
[Arriving in Macau in no time at all.]

1194
01:14:25,228 --> 01:14:27,682
[Fans are gathered here as well!]

1195
01:14:27,683 --> 01:14:31,377
[Wow... all of you are amazing!]

1196
01:14:37,369 --> 01:14:39,648
[Even worrying for the well-being of
Mr. Capable after seeing that he's injured...]

1197
01:14:40,891 --> 01:14:42,894
[Stay strong, Tiger!]

1198
01:14:43,746 --> 01:14:45,955
You didn't have to bring me any flowers!

1199
01:14:45,956 --> 01:14:47,929
You really didn't have to do that.

1200
01:14:47,929 --> 01:14:50,447
[It's because we really need to get you to
the site and start shooting quickly...]

1201
01:14:50,949 --> 01:14:53,443
<i>There are two people who are
desperately awaiting your arrival.</i>

1202
01:14:53,830 --> 01:14:55,247
- Two people?
- Yes, two people.

1203
01:14:55,247 --> 01:14:56,959
What do you mean, two people?
Why are there two people?

1204
01:14:57,239 --> 01:14:59,437
[Those two people are...]

1205
01:14:59,437 --> 01:15:03,683
[Easy Brothers...]

1206
01:15:03,987 --> 01:15:09,237
I love Thailand, Macau... and Hong Kong.
And China.

1207
01:15:09,731 --> 01:15:11,621
And Korea.

1208
01:15:13,585 --> 01:15:16,119
[Who could they be...]

1209
01:15:17,436 --> 01:15:19,826
[St. Paul Cathedral]

1210
01:15:20,897 --> 01:15:23,639
[Already a huge gathering of a crowd.]

1211
01:15:25,429 --> 01:15:28,314
[Members finally arrive at Senado.]

1212
01:15:31,443 --> 01:15:33,638
<i>Are you all being careful with the
safekeeping of your daggers?</i>

1213
01:15:33,638 --> 01:15:34,650
- Yes.
- Yes.

1214
01:15:34,685 --> 01:15:36,693
[This mission is...]

1215
01:15:38,399 --> 01:15:42,141
<i>[Go find seven foreigners
who meet your conditions.]</i>

1216
01:15:42,141 --> 01:15:45,713
<i>[Go find seven people who can speak
the Korean language.]</i>

1217
01:15:45,713 --> 01:15:46,928
<i>Seven people?</i>

1218
01:15:47,830 --> 01:15:50,224
<i>Go find foreigners who are
taller than Ha Ha.</i>

1219
01:15:50,225 --> 01:15:51,962
[Seven foreigners who are taller
than Ha Ha.]

1220
01:15:51,962 --> 01:15:54,020
- That's not going to be easy.
- That's way too easy!

1221
01:15:54,956 --> 01:15:56,654
[Everyone here?]

1222
01:15:58,784 --> 01:16:00,998
[Easy Brothers' mission is...]

1223
01:16:00,998 --> 01:16:03,251
<i>[Find seven foreigners with
glasses on.]</i>

1224
01:16:04,768 --> 01:16:06,658
[Start the mission!]

1225
01:16:08,225 --> 01:16:10,090
- Since there are only the two of you...
- Yes?

1226
01:16:10,091 --> 01:16:12,213
<i>Before you go off to find
your foreigners...</i>

1227
01:16:12,214 --> 01:16:13,502
[Before they go off on their search?]

1228
01:16:16,240 --> 01:16:17,900
- Are we going to be spies?
- No.

1229
01:16:18,225 --> 01:16:20,702
<i>You're at a disadvantage since
there are only two of you, right?</i>

1230
01:16:20,703 --> 01:16:22,891
We've pretty much been relegated to
coming in last all day today.

1231
01:16:22,892 --> 01:16:24,560
- I know.
- That's why...

1232
01:16:24,827 --> 01:16:28,502
There will be... one other person
who will be joining your team.

1233
01:16:28,503 --> 01:16:30,001
- That person is...
- Is it another guest?

1234
01:16:30,359 --> 01:16:32,203
<i>That person will be carrying around
a bouquet of flowers.</i>

1235
01:16:32,204 --> 01:16:33,315
We have to go find the person?

1236
01:16:33,315 --> 01:16:35,832
<i>Go find the person who's carrying
around the bouquets of flowers.</i>

1237
01:16:36,362 --> 01:16:41,871
[Find the person... who's carrying
around the bouquet of flowers.]

1238
01:16:41,871 --> 01:16:44,703
[We never said that it was a guest...]

1239
01:16:45,697 --> 01:16:48,159
I came on today determined to
make a love connection with someone.

1240
01:16:49,453 --> 01:16:52,029
[Then give it your best shot
with this person.]

1241
01:16:53,654 --> 01:16:55,215
Don't you think it'll be an Idol?

1242
01:16:56,073 --> 01:16:58,819
[Full of excited anticipation]

1243
01:16:58,820 --> 01:17:00,156
Bouquet of flowers...

1244
01:17:00,812 --> 01:17:03,755
[Carefully searching throughout the area...]

1245
01:17:03,755 --> 01:17:04,759
I don't see anyone.

1246
01:17:05,809 --> 01:17:08,800
[Someone carrying around
a bouquet of flowers...]

1247
01:17:09,131 --> 01:17:11,266
[Oh!]

1248
01:17:11,437 --> 01:17:13,687
[A bouquet of flowers]

1249
01:17:15,077 --> 01:17:18,451
[But, wait a minute...]

1250
01:17:18,451 --> 01:17:21,615
[Those familiar biceps...]

1251
01:17:21,615 --> 01:17:23,015
No way!

1252
01:17:24,593 --> 01:17:26,260
- No way!
- Jong Kook!

1253
01:17:26,261 --> 01:17:28,312
- Jong Kook!
- No way!

1254
01:17:29,298 --> 01:17:30,984
What took you so long to get here?

1255
01:17:31,744 --> 01:17:33,121
What took you so long, Jong Kook?

1256
01:17:33,122 --> 01:17:35,217
You didn't have to get all
dressed up for us!

1257
01:17:35,705 --> 01:17:38,174
Promise me that you'll never leave
us ever again!

1258
01:17:39,153 --> 01:17:40,388
You should've came earlier!

1259
01:17:41,236 --> 01:17:44,336
- Hey...
- Do you know how we've been treated?

1260
01:17:44,823 --> 01:17:47,858
- Why is it both of you?
- Promise me that you'll never leave again!

1261
01:17:49,031 --> 01:17:53,285
You're ours. We don't
have a single dagger right now.

1262
01:17:53,285 --> 01:17:56,045
- Then the three of us are a team?
- Hurry up and take this off! There's no time!

1263
01:17:56,046 --> 01:17:57,245
What are you doing!

1264
01:17:58,485 --> 01:18:02,257
[The moment they see Mr. Capable,
their sorrow of the day comes flooding in.]

1265
01:18:02,257 --> 01:18:04,548
- Your foot isn't injured, is it?
- Suk Jin, I'm sorry...

1266
01:18:04,548 --> 01:18:07,160
[Mr. Capable with an injured foot.]

1267
01:18:07,653 --> 01:18:09,928
- I'm sorry about this.
- We need to rethink this.

1268
01:18:09,928 --> 01:18:13,021
- You hurt your foot?
- It's just slightly uncomfortable.

1269
01:18:13,732 --> 01:18:16,430
Are you Mr. Kim Jong Kook?
It's very nice to meet you.

1270
01:18:16,932 --> 01:18:18,642
- I think we've got the wrong person.
- No, it's not that.

1271
01:18:19,729 --> 01:18:21,522
Suk Jin... Suk Jin, what are you doing?

1272
01:18:21,523 --> 01:18:23,796
You can't be like this!
The body isn't everything here.

1273
01:18:23,797 --> 01:18:25,938
Our minds have to be in sync as a team.

1274
01:18:25,939 --> 01:18:27,152
No, when it comes to you,
the body is everything.

1275
01:18:28,162 --> 01:18:31,835
- It's just very slightly uncomfortable.
- So you can still participate in the mission?

1276
01:18:31,836 --> 01:18:33,725
- Of course!
- Can I kick it to make sure?

1277
01:18:34,521 --> 01:18:37,226
- You can't kick my foot!
- Then can I step on it?

1278
01:18:37,227 --> 01:18:38,508
Don't do that!

1279
01:18:38,803 --> 01:18:42,736
[If you guys can't believe me...]

1280
01:18:45,524 --> 01:18:48,699
[I'm still Mr. Capable!]

1281
01:18:48,699 --> 01:18:52,007
[I'm Mr. Capable who ousted
Chu Sung Hoon!]

1282
01:18:52,007 --> 01:18:54,301
[I'm still alive...]

1283
01:18:54,301 --> 01:18:57,009
[Reverting back to revering in
his presence.]

1284
01:18:57,010 --> 01:18:59,745
- Hurry up and get this on him.
- I told you to believe me and that I'm fine.

1285
01:18:59,745 --> 01:19:02,631
[Easy Brothers immediately
becoming submissive.]

1286
01:19:03,464 --> 01:19:05,041
Seriously...

1287
01:19:05,460 --> 01:19:08,772
- Other teams each have a dagger right now...
- We don't have a dagger?

1288
01:19:09,063 --> 01:19:11,443
- No, we don't have one.
- What have you been doing? We need a dagger!

1289
01:19:11,443 --> 01:19:14,705
Hey... you have no idea how hard
we've both been trying!

1290
01:19:15,407 --> 01:19:17,959
People weren't even acknowledging us!

1291
01:19:19,476 --> 01:19:22,231
This is the first time we're being shown
on this broadcast on this episode right now.

1292
01:19:22,249 --> 01:19:25,333
[What are you talking about...]

1293
01:19:25,333 --> 01:19:27,133
Hello to all our viewers,
my name is Lee Kwang Soo.

1294
01:19:27,449 --> 01:19:29,807
We're in Macau.
We've been here all along too!

1295
01:19:30,766 --> 01:19:33,364
[From this moment on,
it's 'Kkuk-Easy Brothers'.]

1296
01:19:34,101 --> 01:19:35,897
<i>They all look so tiny.</i>

1297
01:19:35,897 --> 01:19:37,867
[Other team members busy
carrying out their mission at hand.]

1298
01:19:39,102 --> 01:19:41,336
- How long...
- Forget it. He's taller than you.

1299
01:19:43,076 --> 01:19:45,779
[Is it way too easy of a mission?]

1300
01:19:46,080 --> 01:19:47,909
- Follow me, follow me!
- Follow?

1301
01:19:48,604 --> 01:19:49,887
- Follow me!
- Follow!

1302
01:19:49,887 --> 01:19:53,115
[Easily finds three to four people
within moments.]

1303
01:19:54,445 --> 01:19:55,832
It's really nice here.

1304
01:19:56,529 --> 01:19:59,959
[Jerky market overflowing with tourists
regardless of the fact that it's evening.]

1305
01:20:00,637 --> 01:20:02,147
<i>This market really is pretty.</i>

1306
01:20:02,429 --> 01:20:05,546
- Anyone speak Korean?
- Does anyone know how to speak Korean?

1307
01:20:05,547 --> 01:20:08,014
- Our mission is way too hard.
- This is really tough.

1308
01:20:08,301 --> 01:20:10,171
You know kpop?

1309
01:20:11,451 --> 01:20:14,284
Listen... listen to me.
One, two, three, four.

1310
01:20:18,330 --> 01:20:21,676
Okay, okay... you?

1311
01:20:21,676 --> 01:20:24,614
[Huh?
That's a song by Leessang?]

1312
01:20:27,580 --> 01:20:31,509
- Okay... okay!
- We've already found five people.

1313
01:20:32,510 --> 01:20:34,957
We have to find foreigners
wearing glasses.

1314
01:20:34,958 --> 01:20:36,564
Can you stick this on my back?

1315
01:20:37,241 --> 01:20:40,013
[Wanting to play the name tag game!]

1316
01:20:40,014 --> 01:20:42,963
No, please don't mention it.
Thank you.

1317
01:20:43,368 --> 01:20:44,912
- I love you!
- Thank you.

1318
01:20:46,612 --> 01:20:49,413
- Wearing glasses...
- We have to find people with glasses.

1319
01:20:49,414 --> 01:20:50,869
- Hey!
- Do you see someone?

1320
01:20:51,907 --> 01:20:54,932
- She'll be perfect.
- Want to play a game with me?

1321
01:20:54,933 --> 01:20:56,324
- Okay.
- Okay, okay.

1322
01:20:57,130 --> 01:20:59,507
[Big-nosed language being understood
rather easily.]

1323
01:20:59,508 --> 01:21:01,465
- Where?
- The lady with the sign.

1324
01:21:04,402 --> 01:21:06,353
[Verifying their height]

1325
01:21:07,792 --> 01:21:10,080
[Everyone passes for being
taller than Ha Ha.]

1326
01:21:10,081 --> 01:21:11,707
- Come on!
- Let's go!

1327
01:21:11,708 --> 01:21:14,291
- Let's go!
- Just a choo choo train.

1328
01:21:14,421 --> 01:21:17,027
[Off to the cathedral.]

1329
01:21:18,858 --> 01:21:21,109
[Quite a large crowd in the
area already.]

1330
01:21:21,110 --> 01:21:23,815
- Now that it's night, the atmosphere...
- Wow, it's killer.

1331
01:21:37,749 --> 01:21:40,152
[Thankful to all the fans for having
waited in a neat and orderly fashion.]

1332
01:21:45,401 --> 01:21:47,209
[Even a lady giraffe is in attendance.]

1333
01:21:49,612 --> 01:21:51,964
[The Green Team have also completed
gathering up all seven of their people.]

1334
01:22:00,412 --> 01:22:02,781
[Blue Team also completes gathering
up their seven people.]

1335
01:22:07,452 --> 01:22:10,660
[Kkuk especially receiving
a lot of love from the crowd.]

1336
01:22:17,881 --> 01:22:19,604
<i>They really are all wearing glasses.</i>

1337
01:22:21,864 --> 01:22:23,234
It's a tug of war.

1338
01:22:24,972 --> 01:22:28,021
[Three-way tug of war]

1339
01:22:34,458 --> 01:22:37,586
[Everyone's surprised after having
seen the rope lying on the ground.

1340
01:22:39,162 --> 01:22:42,241
[Another surprise after seeing
Mr. Capable in attendance.]

1341
01:22:46,147 --> 01:22:47,897
- Why did you come?
- What do you mean?

1342
01:22:49,289 --> 01:22:52,244
[Overabundance of excited welcome for
Kkuk, the latecomer.]

1343
01:22:53,180 --> 01:22:56,098
[Even though they're glad to see him, of all
things it has to be a tug-of-war mission!]

1344
01:22:56,098 --> 01:22:59,080
- Where have you been all day?
- You can't spring tug-of-war on us now!

1345
01:23:01,868 --> 01:23:05,641
[It's completely unknown as to who
the dagger will go to this time...]

1346
01:23:06,987 --> 01:23:09,359
[Each team with seven recruits
on their side.]

1347
01:23:09,359 --> 01:23:11,113
<i>- Shouldn't we be testing them out?
- Okay, you can check it out.</i>

1348
01:23:11,538 --> 01:23:14,309
- Who's your favorite Running Man member?
- You.

1349
01:23:14,604 --> 01:23:16,129
- Huh?
- Lee Kwang Soo.

1350
01:23:16,194 --> 01:23:17,788
Pass!

1351
01:23:23,447 --> 01:23:27,442
- Who's your favorite Running Man member?
- Not you. Gary...

1352
01:23:27,443 --> 01:23:28,536
Disqualified!

1353
01:23:30,247 --> 01:23:32,553
- Why? Why is he disqualified?
- Why?

1354
01:23:34,681 --> 01:23:39,067
[All three teams succeeded in bringing
seven recruits who meet their requirements.]

1355
01:23:39,560 --> 01:23:41,029
<i>This mission...</i>

1356
01:23:42,197 --> 01:23:44,157
<i>is a tug-of-war.</i>

1357
01:23:44,158 --> 01:23:46,012
[As predicted,
it's the tug-of-war mission.]

1358
01:23:46,212 --> 01:23:49,285
[Blue Team's confidence is flying high with
their warrior, Mr. Capable on their side.]

1359
01:23:50,835 --> 01:23:52,973
Why did Jong Kook have to
come on the show now?

1360
01:23:56,228 --> 01:23:59,505
<i>As you can see,
it's a three way tug-of-war.</i>

1361
01:23:59,859 --> 01:24:03,817
<i>Each team may grasp one of the lines,
and pull it towards them...</i>

1362
01:24:04,100 --> 01:24:08,074
<i>Behind the last person on each team,
you'll all find that there's a bell attached.</i>

1363
01:24:08,392 --> 01:24:10,880
<i>You have to ring that bell
to win the game.</i>

1364
01:24:10,881 --> 01:24:12,366
[Must ring the bell to win the game.]

1365
01:24:14,236 --> 01:24:17,096
Since we need someone strong to pull,
I'll stand up front.

1366
01:24:17,097 --> 01:24:20,200
- And Kwang Soo, you can go to the back.
- This is our Jong Kook right here!

1367
01:24:20,201 --> 01:24:22,812
You can formulate all the plans, Jong Kook.

1368
01:24:23,232 --> 01:24:25,583
Since Kwang Soo's tall,
he can go stand all the way at the back.

1369
01:24:25,584 --> 01:24:28,366
Suk Jin and I can stand up front,
and everyone else in the middle.

1370
01:24:28,367 --> 01:24:32,246
- Fighting!
- Pil chok cross!

1371
01:24:35,312 --> 01:24:38,039
- Guy...
- Everybody...

1372
01:24:38,754 --> 01:24:41,348
- Everybody... ah... fighting?
- Ah...

1373
01:24:42,655 --> 01:24:44,234
- Full power.
- Full power?

1374
01:24:46,704 --> 01:24:50,170
Believe my team...
I believe in my team.

1375
01:24:51,518 --> 01:24:54,199
[Captain Gary being received
by a round of applause.]

1376
01:24:54,199 --> 01:24:55,644
- Trust me.
- Okay!

1377
01:24:57,561 --> 01:25:01,081
- Okay, fighting...
- One, two, three, fighting!

1378
01:25:05,875 --> 01:25:08,687
<i>The game starts the moment
you're all up.</i>

1379
01:25:08,688 --> 01:25:12,505
[The team that wins two out of three
wins the game.]

1380
01:25:14,771 --> 01:25:18,039
[We're on the winning team's side!]

1381
01:25:21,884 --> 01:25:23,063
<i>Ready...</i>

1382
01:25:23,388 --> 01:25:25,407
<i>Set...</i>

1383
01:25:25,408 --> 01:25:33,171
[Who will be the winner of tug-of-war which
will determine who'll get the third dagger?]

1384
01:25:46,003 --> 01:25:49,879
[If the person at the end rings the bell,
then that team wins the round.]

1385
01:25:57,311 --> 01:26:01,343
[The end of the line where even finding
the balance is a difficult task.]

1386
01:26:04,889 --> 01:26:11,075
[Screaming... with their teeth gritted...]

1387
01:26:13,933 --> 01:26:17,922
[A victory that's not so
easy to acquire...]

1388
01:26:21,096 --> 01:26:24,554
[The war gets more and more
prolonged...]

1389
01:26:29,496 --> 01:26:33,560
[The bell!]

1390
01:26:38,048 --> 01:26:41,351
[The bell is just barely out of his reach!]

1391
01:26:46,015 --> 01:26:47,635
[Just then...]

1392
01:26:53,585 --> 01:26:56,920
[Yellow Team's Ha Ha is almost at the bell!]

1393
01:27:08,760 --> 01:27:11,203
[Not easy even for
the Giraffe with his long arms.]

1394
01:27:14,736 --> 01:27:16,071
[Will Haroro ultimately be the one?]

1395
01:27:16,072 --> 01:27:18,359
[What a loss...]

1396
01:27:20,835 --> 01:27:23,803
[Everyone doing their best without any
knowledge of what's going on in the back!]

1397
01:27:25,244 --> 01:27:28,099
[Just a little bit more...]

1398
01:27:36,974 --> 01:27:39,676
[Yellow Team wins!]

1399
01:27:41,246 --> 01:27:44,400
[Could it be the power of the team members
who are all taller than Ha Ha?]

1400
01:27:51,720 --> 01:27:56,493
[In the midst of the enthusiastic cheers,
the first victory goes to the Yellow Team!]

1401
01:27:57,698 --> 01:28:00,519
[Encouraging his team members
for fighting hard during the battle.]

1402
01:28:02,429 --> 01:28:04,199
I was this far away.

1403
01:28:07,383 --> 01:28:09,286
[Time to formulate a battle plan.]

1404
01:28:11,483 --> 01:28:14,235
[Suggesting they match their beats
to pull at a faster rate.]

1405
01:28:15,862 --> 01:28:18,376
[Even though they can't communicate as
easily, their desire to win is all the same.]

1406
01:28:19,132 --> 01:28:21,168
Suk Jin, why don't you go to the back?

1407
01:28:21,169 --> 01:28:23,158
I think we'll be able to work
better that way.

1408
01:28:23,758 --> 01:28:26,605
[Prepare for the second round.]

1409
01:28:28,768 --> 01:28:30,949
Are you sure this plan is a good one?
Leaving this big gap like this?

1410
01:28:34,577 --> 01:28:36,966
[Blue Team using extreme measures.]

1411
01:28:43,809 --> 01:28:46,630
[Giraffe wave...]

1412
01:28:54,773 --> 01:28:59,091
[Cheers and battle cry that can be
heard all throughout Macau.]

1413
01:29:04,081 --> 01:29:05,401
[Ready]

1414
01:29:06,874 --> 01:29:08,144
[Start]

1415
01:29:10,475 --> 01:29:13,501
[Will Yellow Team pull off another victory?]

1416
01:29:14,480 --> 01:29:18,931
[Or will the victory go to another team?]

1417
01:29:23,177 --> 01:29:25,478
[The tail for the Yellow Team
is once again, Haroro.]

1418
01:29:28,164 --> 01:29:30,100
[Green Team's tail, Dong Wook.]

1419
01:29:40,147 --> 01:29:42,721
[Power up, short little arm!]

1420
01:29:44,748 --> 01:29:47,126
[Staying tight in all three directions.]

1421
01:29:48,916 --> 01:29:52,208
[Unable to make any advances.]

1422
01:29:53,792 --> 01:29:55,990
[Injured Mr. Capable]

1423
01:30:04,612 --> 01:30:07,619
[Just a little bit more!]

1424
01:30:07,620 --> 01:30:10,714
[It's Haroro once again!]

1425
01:30:11,605 --> 01:30:15,660
[Will the victory be theirs?]

1426
01:30:17,957 --> 01:30:21,694
[Almost!]

1427
01:30:28,477 --> 01:30:30,997
[Yellow Team wins two out of three!]

1428
01:30:38,935 --> 01:30:42,280
[Yellow Team's unbelievable winning streak.]

1429
01:30:47,860 --> 01:30:51,788
[A victory that could only be won
by having worked together as one.]

1430
01:30:58,016 --> 01:30:59,503
They're really strong.

1431
01:31:03,821 --> 01:31:06,386
[Yellow Team wins the mission.]

1432
01:31:12,016 --> 01:31:15,810
[The third dagger.]

1433
01:31:18,670 --> 01:31:22,678
[On top of the first dagger, they now
have possession of the third dagger!]

1434
01:31:23,398 --> 01:31:26,038
- We don't have any?
- No, we don't.

1435
01:31:26,039 --> 01:31:28,636
- What have you been doing all day?
- We were waiting for you.

1436
01:31:30,720 --> 01:31:32,472
This team is now just beginning.

1437
01:31:32,473 --> 01:31:34,042
[Now finally getting started as a team...]

1438
01:31:35,536 --> 01:31:38,497
[To all the fans that cheered us
on enthusiastically...]

1439
01:31:38,497 --> 01:31:41,018
[We sincerely thank you.]

1440
01:31:48,846 --> 01:31:51,570
[The last dagger of the day...]

1441
01:31:51,974 --> 01:31:54,287
[Is at the hotel!]

1442
01:31:57,256 --> 01:32:01,190
[The secret of the nine swords-
Find the 'R' marked flag.]

1443
01:32:01,191 --> 01:32:03,180
[Macau's 'S' hotel]

1444
01:32:04,560 --> 01:32:07,314
[Somewhere in this expansive hotel...]

1445
01:32:07,314 --> 01:32:10,462
[Find the 'R' flag.]

1446
01:32:21,104 --> 01:32:22,213
Where is it?

1447
01:32:22,214 --> 01:32:23,700
Where's the 'R' flag?

1448
01:32:30,158 --> 01:32:33,104
[Asking the front desk?]

1449
01:32:33,104 --> 01:32:35,101
- Do you have a 'R'...
- Huh?

1450
01:32:35,102 --> 01:32:37,264
'R'?
Do you know 'R'?

1451
01:32:37,265 --> 01:32:39,830
[It seems the front desk
isn't the spot...]

1452
01:32:40,788 --> 01:32:42,560
How are we supposed to find it
in this large place?

1453
01:32:43,647 --> 01:32:45,839
Wow, this place is so huge.
Huge!

1454
01:32:45,840 --> 01:32:47,818
[A monstrous shopping mall
that's connected to the hotel.]

1455
01:32:47,856 --> 01:32:49,061
This is amazing.

1456
01:32:49,903 --> 01:32:52,335
Do you have a Running Man flag?

1457
01:33:00,649 --> 01:33:02,902
[Find the last dagger...]

1458
01:33:02,902 --> 01:33:04,006
Look up there!

1459
01:33:04,797 --> 01:33:06,451
Welcome Running Man.

1460
01:33:07,201 --> 01:33:09,325
[Wow! A welcome message!]

1461
01:33:11,939 --> 01:33:13,209
Isn't that amazing?

1462
01:33:13,695 --> 01:33:15,545
Welcome.
Welcome Running Man.

1463
01:33:15,546 --> 01:33:16,978
Jong Kook, look at that writing.

1464
01:33:16,979 --> 01:33:18,598
Look at the letters on that
cascading water.

1465
01:33:20,804 --> 01:33:22,166
Wow... that's awesome.

1466
01:33:23,569 --> 01:33:26,084
- I think something may be over there.
- There has to be something over there.

1467
01:33:31,611 --> 01:33:33,942
[Oh! The 'R' flag!]

1468
01:33:35,317 --> 01:33:37,035
Wow! Here it is!
Here it is!

1469
01:33:37,958 --> 01:33:40,969
[The 'R' flag on top of the steps!]

1470
01:33:42,780 --> 01:33:43,945
Isn't this it?

1471
01:33:46,660 --> 01:33:47,735
Isn't this it?

1472
01:33:49,486 --> 01:33:51,310
- It's alive!
- It's a person!

1473
01:33:51,310 --> 01:33:53,897
[Wow... it's alive and moving...]

1474
01:33:55,640 --> 01:33:57,685
[The dagger!]

1475
01:33:58,423 --> 01:34:01,075
- I had no idea that it was a person.
- I had no idea either.

1476
01:34:01,076 --> 01:34:02,248
[Succeeds at finding the 'R' flag.]

1477
01:34:02,249 --> 01:34:03,614
It's nice to meet you.

1478
01:34:04,835 --> 01:34:06,844
- Is this right?
- Did we really just find it?

1479
01:34:06,845 --> 01:34:08,509
- We found it.
