00:11:58,015 --> 00:12:00,009
I feel like something is going to
jump out at me.

178
00:12:03,022 --> 00:12:05,543
[The boat is gliding into the cave.]

179
00:12:06,789 --> 00:12:08,008
This is scary.

180
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:11,216
[Scary... yet fascinating...]

181
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:13,947
This feels like something
out of a movie.

182
00:12:14,808 --> 00:12:17,718
[Fascinating cave with narrow
and low ceiling passages.]

183
00:12:17,719 --> 00:12:20,852
Even though I'm scared, it's still amazing.
How can a place like this exist?

184
00:12:20,852 --> 00:12:22,599
[Nonstop mumbling from being frightened.]

185
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,319
I've never been to a place like this before.

186
00:12:25,638 --> 00:12:28,302
What is...
Why is Running Man all of a sudden...

187
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:30,572
This feels like something out of a movie.

188
00:12:31,788 --> 00:12:33,418
Isn't this terrifying?

189
00:12:35,886 --> 00:12:37,422
Please drive safely.

190
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:38,800
[Kwang Soo follows Ha Ha's trail
into the cave.]

191
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,148
That's just a huge rock, isn't it?

192
00:12:41,336 --> 00:12:42,464
In there?

193
00:12:44,942 --> 00:12:46,392
We're going in there?

194
00:12:52,003 --> 00:12:53,662
What is this?
Are you sure it's this way?

195
00:12:53,663 --> 00:12:54,997
Where are we going?

196
00:12:57,732 --> 00:12:59,542
In here... are you sure about this?

197
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:01,478
Are you sure this is a passageway?

198
00:13:03,573 --> 00:13:05,021
This is no joke!

199
00:13:07,351 --> 00:13:10,288
Those things up there
that look like icicles...

200
00:13:10,358 --> 00:13:12,305
Sta... statics?

201
00:13:12,686 --> 00:13:14,946
[You mean, stalactite?]

202
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:19,134
[Second group still rowing their boats.
Jae Suk, Dong Wook, and Blank Ji.]

203
00:13:19,135 --> 00:13:20,951
Wow... how are we doing this?

204
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,595
Wow... this is hard.

205
00:13:25,116 --> 00:13:26,424
Hey...

206
00:13:26,425 --> 00:13:27,600
Dong Wook!

207
00:13:29,276 --> 00:13:31,021
Why am I turning in circles?

208
00:13:32,009 --> 00:13:33,649
Mine won't go forward!

209
00:13:34,749 --> 00:13:36,811
Why can't anything be easy?

210
00:13:39,377 --> 00:13:40,899
How am I supposed to do this?

211
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:43,571
How am I supposed to do this?

212
00:13:45,962 --> 00:13:48,833
[Going deeper into the cave...]

213
00:13:50,942 --> 00:13:52,279
What is that?

214
00:13:54,134 --> 00:13:58,877
[Inside the cave...]

215
00:13:58,877 --> 00:14:02,272
[Is another small cave?]

216
00:14:05,355 --> 00:14:07,542
[Scaredy cat Ro-Ro steps out
of the boat...]

217
00:14:10,703 --> 00:14:12,254
What's this?
Is this the end?

218
00:14:22,392 --> 00:14:25,469
[Discovers a hidden scroll!]

219
00:14:30,412 --> 00:14:35,828
[When you possess the powerful
sword in hand...

220
00:14:35,829 --> 00:14:41,244
powers greater than you can
ever imagine...]

221
00:14:42,153 --> 00:14:46,489
[Once a powerful golden sword is in your
possession, you will gain amazing powers.]

222
00:14:49,002 --> 00:14:53,051
[Use the amazing powers of the golden
sword to awaken the golden turtle...

223
00:14:53,051 --> 00:14:55,916
[by giving it up as a sacrifice, and
gain the power to rule the earth.]

224
00:14:56,282 --> 00:14:58,472
[Giraffe also arrives at the
secret cave's opening.]

225
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:01,408
Dong Hoon.

226
00:15:02,585 --> 00:15:03,716
<i>Dong Hoon!</i>

227
00:15:06,016 --> 00:15:07,894
What are you doing?
What is that?

228
00:15:08,634 --> 00:15:09,885
You and I...

229
00:15:09,886 --> 00:15:11,673
You and I can do this together.

230
00:15:13,444 --> 00:15:16,115
[These two characters...]

231
00:15:17,244 --> 00:15:18,796
I discovered this here.

232
00:15:19,628 --> 00:15:21,266
- What?
- You were trying to hide this?

233
00:15:21,267 --> 00:15:22,885
No, I was going to show it to you.

234
00:15:26,716 --> 00:15:30,652
[The legend of the golden sword.]

235
00:15:30,653 --> 00:15:32,303
- We have to do this together.
- It's a map.

236
00:15:32,304 --> 00:15:34,846
[A map on the back of the scroll.]

237
00:15:35,467 --> 00:15:37,561
Where is this place?
Is this where we're at right now?

238
00:15:38,451 --> 00:15:42,296
[Does this mean outside the cave is where
the absolute golden sword lies in wait?]

239
00:15:45,099 --> 00:15:48,277
- Dong Hoon... let's do it together.
- Kwang Soo, we're in this together.

240
00:15:48,278 --> 00:15:51,256
Tr-ai-tors Cross!

241
00:15:52,561 --> 00:15:53,638
Go, go, go!

242
00:15:56,347 --> 00:15:58,923
Sword... the golden sword.

243
00:16:01,143 --> 00:16:05,043
If I can just get that sword...
the whole world will become mine.

244
00:16:05,044 --> 00:16:06,098
[Once the sword is in his possession,
the world will become his to rule!]

245
00:16:06,643 --> 00:16:09,054
[Giraffe of the Traitors Club dreaming
the same dream and Ro-Ro.]

246
00:16:09,054 --> 00:16:10,655
[That sword will be mine!]

247
00:16:12,136 --> 00:16:14,339
[The last group finally getting
the oars in their hands.]

248
00:16:20,358 --> 00:16:22,462
Why is this suddenly...

249
00:16:22,463 --> 00:16:24,034
Oh, this is out of its place.

250
00:16:25,336 --> 00:16:27,891
Jong Kook just broke the boat!

251
00:16:28,526 --> 00:16:30,672
He broke the oar
because of his brute strength!

252
00:16:32,224 --> 00:16:35,096
Seriously... he broke the oar!

253
00:16:36,393 --> 00:16:38,038
Why did you have to jump in my boat
and making yourself suffer?

254
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:39,879
I don't know.
I should've just gotten a boat of my own.

255
00:16:41,713 --> 00:16:44,261
[Suk Jin and Hye Jin's boat not looking
as though it's going to make any progress.]

256
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:47,248
When are we ever going to get there?

257
00:16:47,782 --> 00:16:49,209
When are we ever going to get there?

258
00:16:49,489 --> 00:16:50,706
Where are we even going?

259
00:16:52,092 --> 00:16:55,288
[Going backwards...]

260
00:16:55,288 --> 00:16:56,708
Why does this thing keep circling around?

261
00:16:57,242 --> 00:16:59,706
[On the other hand, inside the cave...]

262
00:16:59,706 --> 00:17:00,766
Oh my...

263
00:17:01,548 --> 00:17:04,742
It's so mystical...
the inside of the cave is so mystical.

264
00:17:06,508 --> 00:17:08,722
For some reason, in place like this...

265
00:17:09,682 --> 00:17:12,411
I feel like some mysterious treasure
would be hidden in here somewhere.

266
00:17:13,031 --> 00:17:15,122
I feel like I'm treasure hunting.

267
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:20,187
[Finally heading back out of the cave?]

268
00:17:22,757 --> 00:17:25,356
[Ro-Ro having reached the other
end of the cave.]

269
00:17:26,037 --> 00:17:27,212
That's awesome.

270
00:17:29,019 --> 00:17:30,331
That's seriously so awesome.

271
00:17:30,794 --> 00:17:34,767
[Heading back out of the cave
just shown on the map.]

272
00:17:40,787 --> 00:17:45,716
[Greeted with another grandiose
and spectacular sight.]

273
00:17:51,175 --> 00:17:54,186
[On top of that hill...]

274
00:17:54,187 --> 00:17:58,174
[A mysterious gateway!]

275

<i>Kwang Soo...</i>

277
00:18:12,753 --> 00:18:15,702
Dong Hoon... I think that's the house
that was pictured on the map.

278
00:18:17,378 --> 00:18:19,986
[The golden sword... must be up there!]

279
00:18:30,035 --> 00:18:31,349
<i>This is unbelievable.</i>

280
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:33,379
[Heading towards the mysterious gateway.]

281
00:18:34,006 --> 00:18:36,464
'The Mummy'... and 'Indiana Jones'...

282
00:18:36,465 --> 00:18:38,708
[Keeping up with his nonstop chatter
from all the mysticism.]

283
00:18:42,167 --> 00:18:43,511
Look at this place.

284
00:18:43,512 --> 00:18:45,756
This is so amazing.

285
00:18:45,757 --> 00:18:47,727
This is just like a work of art.
This is like a scene right out of a movie.

286
00:18:47,727 --> 00:18:49,800
This is the Running Man movie.

287
00:18:51,602 --> 00:18:53,787
[Giraffe following right in
Ro-Ro's footsteps.]

288
00:18:57,813 --> 00:19:01,775
[Will the golden sword really be
found through that gateway?]

289
00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:05,326
- I think we're heading in there.
- Yeah... I think we're heading in there.

290
00:19:06,234 --> 00:19:08,522
The way we look right now...

291
00:19:09,128 --> 00:19:11,331
It's like you're the rich Vietnamese man...

292
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:14,435
- and I'm the young trophy wife.
- The young trophy wife.

293
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:18,393
[The rich couple taking a
scenic tour of the cave.]

294
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,546
My wife... I will make you happy
for the rest of your life.

295
00:19:21,547 --> 00:19:23,062
Rich, rich?

296
00:19:23,475 --> 00:19:24,798
Rich, rich, rich?

297
00:19:26,456 --> 00:19:28,253
I'm a rich man!

298
00:19:28,254 --> 00:19:29,912
[The rich couple heading to the
inside of the cave.]

299
00:19:29,913 --> 00:19:31,417
Are you sure that we're
supposed to go in here?

300
00:19:31,418 --> 00:19:33,221
Are you sure we're allowed in here?

301
00:19:34,172 --> 00:19:35,754
<i>Is anyone here?</i>

302
00:19:35,755 --> 00:19:37,393
<i>Is no one in here?</i>

303
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:39,967
Wow... just where in the world
is this place?

304
00:19:39,968 --> 00:19:42,911
[Jae Suk and Dong Wook having
exited from the other side of the cave.]

305
00:19:44,232 --> 00:19:45,808
This is really...

306

[Discovers the mysterious gateway.]

307
00:19:50,671 --> 00:19:52,438
Wow... I can't believe something
like that is up there.

308

you'd see out of a martial arts movie?</i>

309
00:19:56,934 --> 00:19:58,913
<i>Yeah, you'd totally see that.</i>

310

[The gateway full of majestic air.]

311
00:20:02,402 --> 00:20:03,652
Amazing.

312
00:20:03,653 --> 00:20:05,038
This is unbelievable.

[Ro-Ro finally arrives at the entrance
of the gateway.]

314

00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:22,972
This is amazing.

316
00:20:23,986 --> 00:20:25,011
Just amazing.

317
00:20:28,709 --> 00:20:31,693
[The door that will lead you to Hoa Lu where
the legendary golden turtle awaits in slumber.]

318
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:34,807
[The door that leads to Hoa Lu?]

319
00:20:36,522 --> 00:20:39,598
[Where could the golden sword be?]

320
00:20:51,804 --> 00:20:54,818
[This is... the golden sword.]

321
00:20:59,601 --> 00:21:03,096
[The power to give the beholder
an absolute power...]

322

[The legendary golden sword.]

323

The golden sword...

324
00:21:15,442 --> 00:21:16,806
The golden sword...

325
00:21:16,807 --> 00:21:18,150
This is it.

326
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:23,671
[The sword... has finally been found!]

327
00:21:24,281 --> 00:21:26,002
[The energy from the sword?]

328
00:21:28,383 --> 00:21:30,812
[Now...]

329
00:21:30,812 --> 00:21:34,459
[The sword is mine...]

330
00:21:42,196 --> 00:21:46,046
[Is this... the secret of the golden sword?]

[Kwang Soo also finally arrives
at the entrance of the gateway.]

332
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:51,414
I've finally arrived.

333
00:21:54,273 --> 00:21:55,579
When I was little...

334
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:58,035
this is the place where I mastered
my martial arts skills.

335
00:22:01,474 --> 00:22:04,879
[Would you like to have a match with
a real martial arts master next time?]

336

- Kwang Soo...
- Dong Hoon!

337
00:22:10,326 --> 00:22:11,852
Lee Kwang Soo... hurry up and get up here.

338
00:22:11,853 --> 00:22:14,030
- Where are you?
- I can't do this alone.

339
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:15,142
Are you up there?

- The golden sword...
- Is this the place?

344
00:22:25,641 --> 00:22:27,876
- Kwang Soo...
- Did you find the golden sword?

345
00:22:29,675 --> 00:22:31,872
[Hiding the golden sword
behind his back?]

346
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:34,082
The golden sword is something
that we can't have.

347
00:22:34,083 --> 00:22:35,807
- What are you talking about?
- I'll give it to you.

348

- Kwang Soo...

350
00:22:40,796 --> 00:22:41,960
I'm so scared.

351
00:22:41,961 --> 00:22:43,322
- I'm so scared.
- Where's the golden sword?

352
00:22:46,468 --> 00:22:47,510
It's right here.

353
00:22:49,478 --> 00:22:52,974
[Is Ro-Ro really...]

354
00:22:52,975 --> 00:22:54,320
I'll give this to you.

355
00:22:54,746 --> 00:22:55,939
Here, take this.

356
00:22:56,894 --> 00:22:58,448
- Okay?
- You're giving it to me?

357
00:22:58,449 --> 00:23:00,027
I can't do it alone.

358
00:23:00,028 --> 00:23:01,235
Kwang Soo...

359
00:23:01,236 --> 00:23:04,842
- Please... save the world.
- Dong Hoon...

360
00:23:04,843 --> 00:23:06,925
- Promise me.
- I promise...

361
00:23:06,926 --> 00:23:09,229
For my master... and my father...

362
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:10,909
And for you...

363
00:23:10,910 --> 00:23:12,923
I will get our revenge on the enemy!

364
00:23:13,347 --> 00:23:14,976
Get down on one knee.

365
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:18,065
Kwang Soo...

366
00:23:18,066 --> 00:23:19,628
Halt.
[Huh?]

367
00:23:21,036 --> 00:23:23,640
<i>Halt.</i>

368
00:23:28,897 --> 00:23:31,350
[This is...]

369
00:23:31,794 --> 00:23:32,992
What did you say?

370
00:23:37,646 --> 00:23:39,700
[Time comes to a halt
for Kwang Soo.]

371
00:23:41,398 --> 00:23:44,631
[Could this be the power
of the golden sword?]

372
00:23:44,917 --> 00:23:46,933
- This sword...
- What is this?

373
00:23:47,512 --> 00:23:48,719
This sword...

374
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,606
I can't do anything about
the control it has over me.

375
00:23:50,607 --> 00:23:51,964
What is this?

376
00:23:53,577 --> 00:23:54,783
What is this?

377
00:23:54,783 --> 00:23:57,785
[With the absolute golden sword in hand,
Ha Ha eliminates Kwang Soo's name tag!]

378
00:23:58,065 --> 00:23:59,894
- Lee Kwang Soo, out.
- I'm out?

379
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:02,655
What?
I'm out?

380
00:24:02,655 --> 00:24:06,447
[Just like this... is Kwang Soo
eliminated from the expedition?]

381
00:24:07,886 --> 00:24:09,552
- Goodbye.
- Dong Hoon!

382
00:24:11,081 --> 00:24:13,737
[The Traitor's Cross coming to
a shatter as predicted.]

383
00:24:16,966 --> 00:24:20,495
[Is that... the power of
the ultimate golden sword?]

384
00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:30,238
[Stop time?]

385
00:24:32,509 --> 00:24:36,319
[So this is the power of the
ultimate golden sword!]

386
00:24:38,042 --> 00:24:39,472
- Kwang Soo...
- Dong Hoon!

387
00:24:39,817 --> 00:24:41,528
Lee Kwang Soo...
hurry up and get up here.

388
00:24:41,529 --> 00:24:43,878
[The reason why he called Kwang Soo
to come up was...]

389
00:24:43,878 --> 00:24:46,833
[Because he had planned on
eliminating Kwang Soo!]

390
00:24:48,773 --> 00:24:50,890
[Oblivious to everything,
Giraffe walks on up the steps.]

391
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:51,962
Hurry.

392
00:24:56,330 --> 00:24:59,870
[Ha Ha waiting for Kwang Soo while
keeping the power of the sword a secret.]

393
00:25:03,052 --> 00:25:06,147
[And with that power,
he eliminates Kwang Soo!]

394
00:25:10,095 --> 00:25:11,385
Now...

395
00:25:11,887 --> 00:25:13,339
The world...

396
00:25:13,567 --> 00:25:14,769
will be mine!

397
00:25:22,885 --> 00:25:25,175
[The world is mine!]

398
00:25:27,225 --> 00:25:29,499
[Must hurry to where
the golden turtle awaits.]

399
00:25:30,755 --> 00:25:33,979
All of the Running Man members
that have disregarded me...

400
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:36,217
Shut... your mouths.

401
00:25:36,413 --> 00:25:38,216
Be... be quiet!

402
00:25:38,621 --> 00:25:40,375
Stand... stand still.

403
00:25:41,891 --> 00:25:46,399
All Running Man members and viewers
that have disregarded me...

404
00:25:46,434 --> 00:25:50,593
Today, you will see the true powers
of Haroro come to light.

405
00:25:50,594 --> 00:25:53,450
[Behold my ultimate power as I possess
the ultimate golden sword in my hand.]

406
00:26:01,246 --> 00:26:03,645
[Where the legendary golden turtle
lies in slumber...]

407
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:06,576
[The door that leads back to Hoa Lu!]

408
00:26:16,189 --> 00:26:22,868
[Through the gateway in Trang An...]

409
00:26:22,869 --> 00:26:28,077
[To Hoa Lu.]

410
00:26:34,126 --> 00:26:37,470
[Hoa Lu: A historical site of an
ancient dynasty.]

411
00:26:40,406 --> 00:26:44,755
[Ultimate golden sword...]

412
00:26:51,073 --> 00:26:52,995
[Transforming back into Haroro mode...]

413
00:26:53,531 --> 00:26:55,064
[This is fun!]

414
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:03,668
There are a lot of natives here.

415
00:27:03,995 --> 00:27:08,616
[To protect the ultimate golden sword...]

416
00:27:08,616 --> 00:27:13,571
[The legendary golden turtle
is said to be here in Hoa Lu.]

417
00:27:17,141 --> 00:27:19,208
[On the other hand...]

418
00:27:20,279 --> 00:27:23,319
[Jae Suk and Dong Wook heading
towards the mysterious gateway.]

419
00:27:23,833 --> 00:27:25,889
Are we going to see the master
or something?

420
00:27:26,302 --> 00:27:28,632
I've realized this while
filming Running Man...

421
00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:31,248
there's no way you can gain weight
while being on this show.

422
00:27:33,103 --> 00:27:35,047
[Arriving at the gateway entrance.]

423
00:27:40,723 --> 00:27:42,299
Where do we need to go?

424
00:27:42,299 --> 00:27:43,770
Can we just walk through?

425
00:27:44,490 --> 00:27:45,842
Do we need to go up?

426
00:27:48,174 --> 00:27:49,468
What the heck?

427
00:27:51,381 --> 00:27:52,902
<i>What is it?
Did you find something?</i>

428
00:27:53,221 --> 00:27:54,608
What is this?

429
00:27:54,609 --> 00:27:56,058
[Kwang Soo's name tag!]

430
00:27:56,691 --> 00:27:59,230
- Hey! Dong Wook!
- Yes, I'm on my way up.

431
00:27:59,932 --> 00:28:01,703
Why is Kwang Soo's name tag up here?

432
00:28:08,446 --> 00:28:09,811
There it is.

433
00:28:09,812 --> 00:28:11,560
Someone already took the sword.

434
00:28:12,063 --> 00:28:13,401
It's Ha Ha.

435
00:28:13,401 --> 00:28:14,867
[That means Ha Ha...]

436
00:28:16,507 --> 00:28:17,911
- It can't be.
- Wait...

437
00:28:22,517 --> 00:28:24,791
[Since the race has started?]

438
00:28:26,033 --> 00:28:28,872
Ha Ha found the sword and
eliminated Kwang Soo's name tag.

439
00:28:31,671 --> 00:28:33,339
Kung Fu!

440
00:28:33,783 --> 00:28:36,330
Doesn't it feel like we're making our way
up to a ultimate secret fighter's club?

441
00:28:40,082 --> 00:28:41,597
Give it back.

442
00:28:44,566 --> 00:28:46,632
- Let's go, Gary.
- Yes, Jong Kook.

443
00:28:46,783 --> 00:28:49,635
Jong Kook...
I'll go first, and check it out.

444
00:28:49,635 --> 00:28:51,337
- Jong Kook.
- Let's go together.

445
00:28:51,337 --> 00:28:53,035
- Don't push yourself too hard, Jong Kook.
- Hey!

446
00:28:53,036 --> 00:28:54,517
I'll go ahead first.

447
00:28:55,399 --> 00:28:57,727
[So this is the door that leads
to Hoa Lu...]

448
00:29:00,845 --> 00:29:03,927
[Ha Ha has the ultimate golden sword...]

449
00:29:04,234 --> 00:29:06,583
Ha Ha found the sword and
eliminated Kwang Soo before he went.

450
00:29:09,318 --> 00:29:10,400
Yes, he did.

451
00:29:11,431 --> 00:29:12,893
Ha Ha...

452
00:29:14,414 --> 00:29:15,770
[Huh?]

453
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:17,371
[Startling his VJ, Gwon Yeol.]

454
00:29:18,172 --> 00:29:19,576
What are you doing?

455
00:29:19,577 --> 00:29:21,299
That's the effect that you
see in movies!

456
00:29:21,299 --> 00:29:24,132
When it flies through the air
and sticks right in front of the camera.

457
00:29:24,132 --> 00:29:25,956
Why are you so afraid of it?

458
00:29:25,957 --> 00:29:27,402
Seriously...

459
00:29:28,010 --> 00:29:29,739
Are you here on a picnic or something?

460
00:29:30,444 --> 00:29:32,706
I can't stay hidden because
you're dressed like that.

461
00:29:32,707 --> 00:29:34,869
Look at how colorful the shirt is
that you're wearing.

462
00:29:35,257 --> 00:29:36,422
Let's go.

463
00:29:36,503 --> 00:29:41,412
[At last... off to Hoa Lu.]

464
00:29:49,063 --> 00:29:50,706
We have to find Ha Ha.

465
00:29:50,707 --> 00:29:53,017
[Ha Ha you scoundrel... where are you?]

466
00:29:54,395 --> 00:29:56,435
- We have to take it from Ha Ha.
- Of course, that's a given.

467
00:29:56,881 --> 00:30:00,254
I'm... going to win today!

468
00:30:00,255 --> 00:30:03,282
- I'm going to win!
- Me!

469
00:30:06,924 --> 00:30:09,723
[Gary and Ji Hyo also head
towards the gateway.]

470
00:30:10,613 --> 00:30:14,390
[This door will lead you to Hoa Lu where the
legendary golden turtle awaits in slumber.]

471
00:30:15,117 --> 00:30:17,802
[To Hoa Lu...]

472
00:30:29,872 --> 00:30:32,533
[Running Man members arriving in
Hoa Lu one by one.]

473
00:30:33,842 --> 00:30:35,635
[The final rich couple.]

474
00:30:38,561 --> 00:30:41,406
[The rich couple's world
will come find them...]

475
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,807
[The rich couple falling into
each other's beat.]

476
00:30:57,356 --> 00:30:58,828
Look at all that.

477
00:30:58,829 --> 00:31:00,040
[This is Hoa Lu!]

478
00:31:01,736 --> 00:31:03,923
[And...]

479
00:31:04,765 --> 00:31:06,270
<i>No!</i>

480
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:11,815
[Giraffe being delivered to Hoa Lu
by the grim reapers.]

481
00:31:11,816 --> 00:31:13,167
I'll get my revenge!

482
00:31:15,159 --> 00:31:17,855
[Heads right over to jail.]

483
00:31:21,447 --> 00:31:22,694
This is a lie.

484
00:31:23,231 --> 00:31:25,760
This is all a lie!

485
00:31:31,511 --> 00:31:34,231
First, they don't know the power
that I'm capable of.

486
00:31:34,763 --> 00:31:37,706
I have the golden sword which
possesses the ultimate power.

487
00:31:37,707 --> 00:31:41,634
While... being on
Running Man all this time...

488
00:31:41,635 --> 00:31:44,831
the energy that I've received
from Suk Jin...

489
00:31:45,577 --> 00:31:47,903
the sorrow of being the race starter...

490
00:31:47,904 --> 00:31:50,285
I will get my revenge with today's race.

491
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:53,848
From this point on...
if I spot you in my sight...

492
00:31:54,291 --> 00:31:56,277
or if I see you anywhere...

493
00:31:56,571 --> 00:31:58,669
I will shout out for you to 'Halt'.

494
00:31:58,670 --> 00:32:00,421
[I will shout out for you to 'Halt'.]

495
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:04,493
To start things off,
I need to eliminate one of them.

496
00:32:04,494 --> 00:32:06,090
That way they'll know to fear me.

497
00:32:06,985 --> 00:32:09,463
I think I'm slowly starting to go crazy.

498
00:32:10,059 --> 00:32:11,516
[You get that too?]

499
00:32:11,517 --> 00:32:14,625
Any moment...
I think I'm going to go insane at any moment.

500
00:32:14,884 --> 00:32:17,285
I think something's invaded my body.

501
00:32:21,401 --> 00:32:25,213
All the sorrow I've felt thus far...
I will get my revenge for it today.

502
00:32:25,214 --> 00:32:30,040
[All the sorrow I've been given...
I will repay them today!]

503
00:32:35,768 --> 00:32:37,807
[On the other hand...]

504
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:44,883
[Jae Suk and Dong Wook on the search
for Ha Ha who took the golden sword away.]

505
00:32:46,998 --> 00:32:48,653
- Isn't that him?
- Over there.

506
00:32:48,654 --> 00:32:49,776
Ha Ha!

507
00:32:50,452 --> 00:32:54,296
[Discovers the owner of the golden sword
who's slowly on his way to insanity.]

508
00:32:54,297 --> 00:32:55,753
<i>He's totally into his character.</i>

509
00:33:00,838 --> 00:33:01,988
Hey...

510
00:33:04,259 --> 00:33:09,179
[I will... show you my powers.]

511
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:11,726
Why did you...
you ousted Kwang Soo, didn't you?

512
00:33:13,371 --> 00:33:15,028
Why do you have the golden sword?

513
00:33:17,891 --> 00:33:20,044
I will give you until the count of three
to make your escape.

514
00:33:20,045 --> 00:33:21,864
- One of you are going to die right now.
- Why?

515
00:33:23,201 --> 00:33:26,662
By the time I count to three...
I suggest that one of you run away.

516
00:33:26,663 --> 00:33:28,174
- You found the power, did you?
- Okay...

517
00:33:28,786 --> 00:33:31,798
- One... one of you are really going to die.
- Really?

518
00:33:32,524 --> 00:33:35,318
[Oh... so this is how you're going to play?]

519
00:33:35,388 --> 00:33:38,200
My black grim reapers...
come this way, please.

520
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:40,839
I'm really going to do this.
One... two...

521
00:33:41,247 --> 00:33:42,401
Three!
Come here!

522
00:33:44,644 --> 00:33:46,147
One of you are going to die!

523
00:33:48,468 --> 00:33:50,714
One of you are going to...
keep on running!

524
00:33:50,715 --> 00:33:51,887
Keep on running!

525
00:33:51,888 --> 00:33:55,088
Should I go left or to the right?
Let's go to the left!

526
00:33:55,964 --> 00:33:57,818
One of you...  one of you!

527
00:33:57,819 --> 00:33:59,638
Run faster, run faster, run faster!

528
00:33:59,639 --> 00:34:01,182
I said, run faster!

529
00:34:03,354 --> 00:34:05,213
- Here I go...
- What is this?

530
00:34:05,214 --> 00:34:07,682
- I'll give you three more seconds to run.
- What are you doing?

531
00:34:08,055 --> 00:34:09,229
Three seconds!

532
00:34:10,459 --> 00:34:12,430
Don't ever show yourself
in front of me again.

533
00:34:13,934 --> 00:34:15,300
Wow... this is awesome.

534
00:34:16,066 --> 00:34:17,863
This is why I'm going insane.

535
00:34:17,864 --> 00:34:20,092
The golden sword is what it's all about.

536
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,908
I wonder if that sword
allows him to do anything?

537
00:34:25,205 --> 00:34:26,382
<i>Hey!</i>

538
00:34:26,383 --> 00:34:27,536
Jae Suk!

539
00:34:29,456 --> 00:34:31,280
If you're curious,
why don't you go check it out?

540
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,435
What's his deal?

541
00:34:32,435 --> 00:34:35,120
- Why is he acting like that?
- What is the deal with him?

542
00:34:35,528 --> 00:34:37,642
I think it has some sort of
special power.

543
00:34:38,235 --> 00:34:40,550
- I think the knife gives you power.
- I think you're right.

544
00:34:41,131 --> 00:34:42,308
- This is...
- Ah!

545
00:34:42,309 --> 00:34:44,117
Those grim reapers were
following him around.

546
00:34:44,118 --> 00:34:46,161
Do you think Ha Ha gets to order
them around like servants?

547
00:34:46,161 --> 00:34:47,748
I think they do his bidding.

548
00:34:47,859 --> 00:34:50,479
I think they do his bidding for him.

549
00:34:53,010 --> 00:34:56,368
[Since they don't know the sword's power,
their terror is multiplied by two!]

550
00:34:57,524 --> 00:35:00,903
[The feeling of having the whole world
in his control!]

551
00:35:04,022 --> 00:35:05,642
Serves them right.

552
00:35:06,550 --> 00:35:08,202
No matter who they may be...

553
00:35:08,844 --> 00:35:10,768
As soon as they see me...

554
00:35:11,548 --> 00:35:14,107
I will make them run away in fear.

555
00:35:18,125 --> 00:35:19,276
Why is he being like that?

556
00:35:19,563 --> 00:35:21,087
Just what in the world is going on?

557
00:35:21,088 --> 00:35:22,764
- I don't know.
- What power does it have?

558
00:35:22,765 --> 00:35:24,984
His character is totally different.

559
00:35:24,985 --> 00:35:29,679
[frustrated and afraid from not knowing
the power the sword is capable of.]

560
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:35,322
- Then... is there no way around it?
- There he is.

561
00:35:35,323 --> 00:35:37,280
See?
Look at that glint in his eyes.

562
00:35:41,391 --> 00:35:42,909
Wow, you really are...

563
00:35:42,910 --> 00:35:44,628
[What's wrong with him?]

564
00:35:44,629 --> 00:35:46,462
Shall we do a little jogging?

565
00:35:46,463 --> 00:35:48,646
- What's wrong with him?
- This time, Dong Wook...

566
00:35:49,832 --> 00:35:53,233
[Unable to confront him,
so no other choice but to run!]

567
00:35:53,234 --> 00:35:54,611
Why are you running?

568
00:35:54,612 --> 00:35:55,921
Run, run!

569
00:35:57,151 --> 00:35:59,013
What's the reason?
What's the reason for all this?

570
00:36:00,585 --> 00:36:04,729
[With the golden sword in my hand...
everyone is in fear of me!]

571
00:36:07,166 --> 00:36:09,823
This is so fun.
This is what it's all about.

572
00:36:10,452 --> 00:36:12,445
Please remain my side forever.

573
00:36:14,063 --> 00:36:18,284
[The sweetest of the power...
slowly going even more insane?]

574
00:36:18,285 --> 00:36:21,248
Stay with me forever...
I love you.

575
00:36:22,528 --> 00:36:25,279
I love you...
I love you.

576
00:36:25,832 --> 00:36:28,734
- Please be my eternal love.
- You think you're Gollum?

577
00:36:32,436 --> 00:36:36,373
[Now that he mentions it,
Ha Ha's speech and behavior is slowly...]

578
00:36:39,576 --> 00:36:42,693
[My precious...]

579
00:36:48,799 --> 00:36:50,425
He really is a sight.

580
00:36:53,435 --> 00:36:57,697
[That golden sword... how do I steal it?]

581
00:36:59,864 --> 00:37:01,622
This really is a stab at my pride.

582
00:37:01,776 --> 00:37:04,548
More than anyone else,
to be chased around by Ha Ha like that...

583
00:37:04,549 --> 00:37:05,769
What is that?

584
00:37:06,849 --> 00:37:08,029
Hey, Kwang Soo!

585
00:37:11,854 --> 00:37:13,434
Hey, do you know what's going on?

586
00:37:13,435 --> 00:37:15,741
I don't even know the game
that's being played today.

587
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:18,251
I saw your name tag that was left
up on the pedestal.

588
00:37:19,397 --> 00:37:20,988
- Today we were...
- Yeah...

589
00:37:22,606 --> 00:37:25,586
[Mr. Capable stops by their way
while on his way past them.]

590
00:37:25,587 --> 00:37:27,209
- What happened to you?
- Right now...

591
00:37:27,210 --> 00:37:31,089
He all of a sudden shouted out, 'Halt', and
I was grabbed so I couldn't move anymore.

592
00:37:31,090 --> 00:37:32,594
- Who did? Who did that?
- The grim reapers.

593
00:37:32,595 --> 00:37:33,907
- It was Ha Ha.
- Ha Ha?

594
00:37:33,908 --> 00:37:35,215
Let me borrow your hat.

595
00:37:36,478 --> 00:37:38,235
I have to disguise myself somehow.

596
00:37:38,235 --> 00:37:40,406
How are you going to do that
when you're wearing that bright red outfit?

597
00:37:40,407 --> 00:37:43,327
- I can at least hide my face.
- Did you only come for the hat?

598
00:37:43,327 --> 00:37:44,621
Let me come with you!

599
00:37:44,622 --> 00:37:46,904
- Can you keep an eye on my bag?
- What are you doing?

600
00:37:47,064 --> 00:37:50,302
[With things borrowed...
and asking to keep an eye on things...]

601
00:37:51,726 --> 00:37:54,093
What am I, the lost and found?

602
00:37:54,921 --> 00:37:56,946
[Just then...]

603
00:37:56,947 --> 00:38:00,704
[The owner of the golden sword
makes his appearance.]

604
00:38:01,538 --> 00:38:03,082
My master's enemy.

605
00:38:03,935 --> 00:38:05,774
You were once like a brother to me.

606
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:10,466
Do you know what happens if I use
this power on you one more time?

607
00:38:11,153 --> 00:38:13,154
You'll get kicked out of here.

608
00:38:14,046 --> 00:38:15,549
Watch closely...

609
00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:17,632
as to what I'm about to do.

610
00:38:17,632 --> 00:38:19,698
They all run from me
as soon as they see me.

611
00:38:19,698 --> 00:38:21,842
A power like that has been given to me.

612
00:38:21,843 --> 00:38:24,751
You have... no idea how much fun it is.

613
00:38:25,393 --> 00:38:28,991
Like scared...
like scared little rats.

614
00:38:28,992 --> 00:38:30,559
This sword was mine.

615
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,198
That's not true.

616
00:38:32,199 --> 00:38:35,915
Say hello to my one and eternal love.
Call her 'Sister-in-law'.

617
00:38:35,916 --> 00:38:37,427
Say hello to your Sister-in-law.

618
00:38:37,428 --> 00:38:39,709
- If you don't, I'll kill you.
- Sister-in-law.

619
00:38:39,709 --> 00:38:40,920
Sister-in-law...

620
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:43,662
Please be my eternal love.

621
00:38:44,417 --> 00:38:45,646
Say hello.

622
00:38:46,136 --> 00:38:47,972
I said, hello.
Aren't you going to do it?

623
00:38:47,973 --> 00:38:49,380
Hello, Sister-in-law.

624
00:38:51,745 --> 00:38:53,639
Kiss the top of my foot.

625
00:38:54,628 --> 00:38:55,756
Do it!

626
00:38:55,757 --> 00:38:57,134
- I won't do it.
- I said, do it!

627
00:38:57,670 --> 00:38:58,799
I'll never do it!

628
00:39:06,163 --> 00:39:07,864
Thanks for the laugh.

629
00:39:07,865 --> 00:39:10,810
[Leaving after having toyed
with Kwang Soo.]

630
00:39:10,811 --> 00:39:12,931
<i>My precious...</i>

631
00:39:14,358 --> 00:39:16,750
I will grant Lee Kwang Soo his one wish.

632
00:39:16,751 --> 00:39:20,002
Why?
Because I have the ultimate power.

633
00:39:20,564 --> 00:39:21,866
Lee Kwang Soo...

634
00:39:22,424 --> 00:39:24,980
All the memories you have of being laughed at
and disregarded since being on Running Man...

635
00:39:24,981 --> 00:39:26,297
remember them all.

636
00:39:28,473 --> 00:39:30,758
Any one person that you want...

637
00:39:32,097 --> 00:39:33,821
I will eliminate for you.

638
00:39:35,603 --> 00:39:36,725
In that case...

639
00:39:38,485 --> 00:39:40,235
JK.

640
00:39:40,606 --> 00:39:43,413
[JK= Jong Kook.]

641
00:39:44,235 --> 00:39:46,073
JK...

642
00:39:47,183 --> 00:39:48,443
I'll be leaving.

643
00:39:49,339 --> 00:39:50,793
You cute little scoundrel.

644
00:39:52,971 --> 00:39:54,203
Please don't do it.

645
00:39:56,245 --> 00:39:58,645
I really think I'm truly going insane.

646
00:39:59,385 --> 00:40:02,212
[Anyone with
the ultimate power in their hands...]

647
00:40:03,090 --> 00:40:06,419
Kim Jong Kook!

648
00:40:08,493 --> 00:40:12,271
[Will he truly be able to oust Mr. Capable?]

649
00:40:12,272 --> 00:40:13,507
<i>Dong Wook!</i>

650
00:40:13,508 --> 00:40:14,895
<i>Who has the sword?</i>

651
00:40:15,677 --> 00:40:17,416
- Suk Jin, we're in trouble.
- Why?

652
00:40:17,417 --> 00:40:18,983
It's no joke right now.

653
00:40:18,984 --> 00:40:22,767
- Hey, Dong Wook...
- He's totally turned into Gollum.

654
00:40:23,211 --> 00:40:27,534
He keeps holding onto the sword
and muttering about how much he loves it.

655
00:40:29,163 --> 00:40:31,031
He's going around with the
grim reapers on his trail.

656
00:40:31,032 --> 00:40:35,212
So when Ha Ha shouts out, 'Halt',
the reapers will take you away.

657
00:40:35,213 --> 00:40:37,669
And Ha Ha can eliminate your
name tag that way.

658
00:40:38,714 --> 00:40:43,291
[Finally understand how Ha Ha is using
the ultimate golden sword's power.]

659
00:40:43,292 --> 00:40:45,547
So the three of us will have to face
the grim reapers...

660
00:40:45,548 --> 00:40:47,549
and then one of us will have to grab
Ha Ha and take the sword away from him.

661
00:40:47,861 --> 00:40:49,915
Kwang Soo's already been ousted.

662
00:40:49,916 --> 00:40:51,832
- Kwang Soo's been ousted?
- Lets go.

663
00:40:51,833 --> 00:40:54,974
Move as fast as you can to oust him.

664
00:40:54,975 --> 00:40:57,889
- You can't, so we'll take down the reapers.
- No, I can't do that.

665
00:40:57,890 --> 00:41:00,211
<i>Kim Jong Kook!</i>

666
00:41:02,608 --> 00:41:04,415
- How are you going to get the reapers?
- Here he comes.

667
00:41:04,416 --> 00:41:06,712
- What do we do? What do we do?
- Everyone has to move.

668
00:41:07,472 --> 00:41:11,966
[Stop the reapers and get Ha Ha!]

669
00:41:11,967 --> 00:41:13,863
I'll get them, so get Ha Ha.

670
00:41:13,864 --> 00:41:16,452
[Ha Ha with his ultimate power
makes his entrance.]

671
00:41:16,453 --> 00:41:18,025
- Get the reapers... get them.
- I'll get them.

672
00:41:18,026 --> 00:41:20,506
Get the reapers... get them.

673
00:41:21,296 --> 00:41:23,490
Ha Ha... you have to get Ha Ha.

674
00:41:23,491 --> 00:41:25,442
Why are you running away?
Why are you running?

675
00:41:25,829 --> 00:41:29,021
[Plan fails! Faced with fear,
the plan fails immediately.]

676
00:41:29,022 --> 00:41:30,946
Why are you running?
Why are you running away?

677
00:41:31,695 --> 00:41:33,723
<i>Why are you running?
Why are you running away?</i>

678
00:41:34,517 --> 00:41:38,293
[Ha Ha chasing after his target,
Mr. Capable.]

679
00:41:41,511 --> 00:41:43,979
[Opening up the ultimate sword!]

680
00:41:43,979 --> 00:41:47,915
[Ha Ha finally pulls out
the ultimate golden sword!]

681
00:41:48,337 --> 00:41:50,898
Hey... you're really doing this to me?
To me?

682
00:41:50,899 --> 00:41:52,417
Utilize me, Dong Hoon.

683
00:41:52,418 --> 00:41:53,827
You can utilize me!

684
00:41:53,828 --> 00:41:56,083
- You can use me like your reapers.
- I don't need to use you.

685
00:41:56,403 --> 00:41:59,659
Because I have the ultimate power.
I have the golden sword.

686
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:01,495
Why me?
When there are plenty of others.

687
00:42:01,496 --> 00:42:03,497
All members of Running Man,
gather around.

688
00:42:03,973 --> 00:42:05,882
- Everyone, gather around!
- Come here!

689
00:42:05,883 --> 00:42:07,229
- I said, come here!
- In order...

690
00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:09,255
The first person to get here,
I will save you until the end to eliminate.

691
00:42:10,405 --> 00:42:12,531
- What is it?
- Why me?

692
00:42:13,053 --> 00:42:14,572
- Why?
- In order...

693
00:42:14,961 --> 00:42:17,924
- I said, come on?
- What's going on here?

694
00:42:20,397 --> 00:42:22,097
That looks like fun.

695
00:42:22,702 --> 00:42:24,556
Today's race is really fun.

696
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:30,359
All the people who have neglected me and
despised me are now gathered in front of me.

697
00:42:30,692 --> 00:42:32,615
- That's not me.
- Suk Jin...

698
00:42:32,616 --> 00:42:35,266
- Go stand afar and watch what I do.
- Okay. Thanks!

699
00:42:35,590 --> 00:42:38,256
Kwang Soo, thanks!

700
00:42:38,257 --> 00:42:40,256
Kwang Soo?
No, stay right here.

701
00:42:40,256 --> 00:42:42,258
No... you can't let him get away now.

702
00:42:42,259 --> 00:42:45,052
Okay... everyone will say
one nice thing about me.

703
00:42:45,053 --> 00:42:46,840
Each of you will now say
one good thing about me now.

704
00:42:46,841 --> 00:42:49,465
If you can't say it within three seconds,
you're dead.

705
00:42:50,170 --> 00:42:51,713
- Set, go.
- Dong Hoon...

706
00:42:51,714 --> 00:42:53,700
All my little girl cousins
are fans of yours.

707
00:42:53,701 --> 00:42:54,988
They said they love only you.

708
00:42:54,988 --> 00:42:57,106
You're the best reggae
in our country.

709
00:42:58,393 --> 00:43:00,411
- Reggae artist.
- You have nothing?

710
00:43:00,412 --> 00:43:02,176
- He's taking too long.
- He's late.

711
00:43:02,177 --> 00:43:03,351
<i>Wait.</i>

712
00:43:04,074 --> 00:43:06,691
- You always make me jealous of you.
- Wait...

713
00:43:06,978 --> 00:43:09,516
Is there even one time when
you felt envious of me?

714
00:43:10,674 --> 00:43:12,679
Tell me when that moment was.
Tell me right now!

715
00:43:13,018 --> 00:43:14,846
- I'm being serious.
- Dong Hoon...

716
00:43:15,077 --> 00:43:17,142
What's the power that you really have?

717
00:43:17,387 --> 00:43:20,264
- Can you just tell us that?
- The ability to take over your name tags.

718
00:43:20,265 --> 00:43:21,534
- Just like that?
- Just like that.

719
00:43:21,535 --> 00:43:23,631
- If you want it?
- Whenever you want?

720
00:43:24,228 --> 00:43:26,924
[Saying one nice thing about Ha Ha...
now it's Mr. Capable's turn.]

721
00:43:26,924 --> 00:43:28,586
You're the best husband in this country.

722
00:43:28,587 --> 00:43:29,901
You're the best husband in this country.

723
00:43:31,096 --> 00:43:33,619
You're really all starting to bore me.

724
00:43:33,620 --> 00:43:35,667
- You're the best husband in this country.
- That expression is really...

725
00:43:36,072 --> 00:43:38,435
- That expression is making me feel too old!
- You're a sexy beast!

726
00:43:38,435 --> 00:43:40,118
- Kim Jong Kook to the front!
- Go up front.

727
00:43:40,119 --> 00:43:43,230
- Why me? Why me?
- Watch carefully.

728
00:43:43,231 --> 00:43:45,594
- You will get to feel true fear.
- What's going to happen?

729
00:43:45,595 --> 00:43:49,477
- Why is he standing like that?
- Why me? Why am I chosen?

730
00:43:57,506 --> 00:44:00,897
Halt, Kim Jong Kook!

731
00:44:00,898 --> 00:44:03,812
<i>Halt, Kim Jong Kook!</i>

732
00:44:07,513 --> 00:44:13,448
[The protectors of the sword,
captures Mr. Capable at Ha Ha's command!]

733
00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:16,257
Once I rip this off...

734
00:44:16,595 --> 00:44:18,591
if you don't run away within two seconds,
another one of you will be dead.

735
00:44:19,025 --> 00:44:21,339
What the heck?
We were all supposed to do this together!

736
00:44:21,340 --> 00:44:22,867
[Trembling in fear...
this is the order to halt?]

737
00:44:22,868 --> 00:44:24,277
We were all supposed to
do this together!

738
00:44:24,278 --> 00:44:25,735
- Three.
- Seriously?

739
00:44:31,154 --> 00:44:34,695
[Mr. Capable, Out!]

740
00:44:35,705 --> 00:44:37,591
[Shock]

741
00:44:37,591 --> 00:44:40,824
[Terror]

742
00:44:40,825 --> 00:44:45,179
[The gruesome public execution
taking place right in front of their eyes?]

743
00:44:45,857 --> 00:44:49,195
[Unreal...
Mr. Capable getting eliminated so easily...]

744
00:44:51,616 --> 00:44:52,921
What's going on?

745
00:44:53,443 --> 00:44:57,451
[Crazed Haroro reigning his terror
upon all the people!]

746
00:44:59,888 --> 00:45:02,861
[Used up two out of three chances
to stop time...]

747
00:45:02,861 --> 00:45:06,677
[Just who will become his last target?]

748
00:45:08,596 --> 00:45:11,553
<i>The truth is, Lee Kwang Soo made a
request to Ha Ha to eliminate you.</i>

749
00:45:11,554 --> 00:45:12,954
What did you say?

750
00:45:12,954 --> 00:45:15,399
He's just saying that because
he's jealous of our relationship.

751
00:45:17,377 --> 00:45:20,075
- Hey... you seriously..
- You believe what he said?

752
00:45:20,076 --> 00:45:22,251
- Have you lost your mind?
- Salute!

753
00:45:24,228 --> 00:45:26,935
- Say hello to you sister-in-law.
- Hello, Sister-in-law!

754
00:45:26,936 --> 00:45:28,216
Have a seat.

755
00:45:28,217 --> 00:45:31,431
Okay... I've kept my promise to you
to fulfill your wish.

756
00:45:32,589 --> 00:45:34,820
You asked me to bring Jong Kook to you.

757
00:45:34,821 --> 00:45:36,369
I've fulfilled you your wish.

758
00:45:37,181 --> 00:45:40,666
Now then... I hope the two of you
have a lovely time together.

759
00:45:47,059 --> 00:45:48,509
Have you lost your mind?

760
00:45:50,695 --> 00:45:52,954
- Wait... listen to me.
- What?

761
00:45:53,572 --> 00:45:55,720
- I wanted you for myself.
- What?

762
00:45:56,005 --> 00:45:57,646
I wanted to be with you.

763
00:45:58,027 --> 00:45:59,482
You're really...

764
00:46:00,539 --> 00:46:02,741
What is this?
Why does this hurt so badly?

765
00:46:02,742 --> 00:46:05,033
Wait... what is this?

766
00:46:05,034 --> 00:46:08,005
[A fascinating experience of making him
jump out of his seat with just two fingers.]

767
00:46:15,011 --> 00:46:18,248
[Didn't realize to make an attempt at
attacking Mr. Capable's injured foot.]

768
00:46:21,079 --> 00:46:22,229
Foot!

769
00:46:22,229 --> 00:46:25,113
[But he fails even at that...]

770
00:46:25,113 --> 00:46:26,555
Why are you like this to me?

771
00:46:26,556 --> 00:46:28,713
- Jong Kook...
- You really...

772
00:46:29,069 --> 00:46:33,269
I should've had the chance to do something
while we're at a place like this.

773
00:46:33,270 --> 00:46:34,883
I don't even know what's
going on today.

774
00:46:36,644 --> 00:46:37,825
Hey!

775
00:46:37,825 --> 00:46:41,254
[Other members feeling even more
separated with Mr. Capable getting ousted.]

776
00:46:41,254 --> 00:46:43,520
Kwang Soo and Jong Kook have been
ousted. There are grim reapers.

777
00:46:43,521 --> 00:46:45,387
- The sword uses the grim reapers.
- The keepers of the sword?

778
00:46:45,388 --> 00:46:47,929
[Relaying the power Ha Ha has with the
sword to Gary and Blank Ji.]

779
00:46:48,404 --> 00:46:51,140
The reapers will grab you so you can't move
and Ha Ha will eliminate your name tag.

780
00:46:51,141 --> 00:46:53,094
- Then that means...
- Then how is the game going to play out?

781
00:46:53,094 --> 00:46:55,202
- I know.
- I'm sure there's a way to free it.

782
00:46:55,203 --> 00:46:57,425
I'm sure there's a way for us
to stop that from being used...

783
00:46:59,136 --> 00:47:00,776
It must be nice for you today.

784
00:47:00,776 --> 00:47:02,914
You blend right in with everyone
walking around here today.

785
00:47:03,166 --> 00:47:04,536
You should walk around with a hat on.

786
00:47:07,732 --> 00:47:10,324
[Wait... now that she takes
a look around...]

787
00:47:10,324 --> 00:47:13,847
[Everyone around here is
dressed in yellow.]

788
00:47:15,894 --> 00:47:19,076
Suk Jin, should I blend myself in
to get rid of him?

789
00:47:19,885 --> 00:47:22,835
[A surprising find of an opportunity!]

790
00:47:22,835 --> 00:47:25,887
[Secretly approach Ha Ha to eliminate him
by utilizing her yellow clothing?]

791
00:47:26,125 --> 00:47:29,629
- Since I'm dressed in the same clothing.
- You can't be told apart dressed like that.

792
00:47:29,986 --> 00:47:32,090
Yeah... we have to oust him
anyway that we can.

793
00:47:32,091 --> 00:47:35,443
- Suk Jin, I'll try it. I'll give it a try.
- He's out of control right now.

794
00:47:35,444 --> 00:47:36,741
I'll give it a try.

795
00:47:37,125 --> 00:47:39,413
Ji Hyo, be careful of your name tag.

796
00:47:39,414 --> 00:47:41,372
Hye Jin... we're in trouble.

797
00:47:42,007 --> 00:47:44,105
Let's do it together and
get rid of him.

798
00:47:45,373 --> 00:47:48,677
- Let's work together to get rid of him.
- Listen to her talking that nonsense.

799
00:47:48,677 --> 00:47:49,790
Why?

800
00:47:50,343 --> 00:47:54,126
[Explaining things to her in detail since
she's only glimpsed at what's happened.]

801
00:47:54,127 --> 00:47:55,946
They're doing whatever
Ha Ha commands them to?

802
00:47:55,946 --> 00:47:57,591
Yeah, when Ha Ha just told them to stop
the cow from pooping, they did.]

803
00:47:57,591 --> 00:48:02,713
[Loyal keepers of the sword who'll even
clean up the cow poop if they're told to.]

804
00:48:03,961 --> 00:48:05,139
I'm scared.

805
00:48:08,325 --> 00:48:10,720
Ha Ha's suddenly starting to
look more powerful.

806
00:48:11,991 --> 00:48:14,978
[Wait... where did Ji Hyo go?]

807
00:48:14,978 --> 00:48:16,499
I can't see Ji Hyo anywhere.

808
00:48:17,479 --> 00:48:22,054
[They just parted a little while ago,
but she really is nowhere to be seen now.]

809
00:48:22,055 --> 00:48:23,382
I can't see Ji Hyo anywhere.

810
00:48:31,312 --> 00:48:32,724
Hurry... hurry.

811
00:48:34,352 --> 00:48:36,683
[Ji Hyo used her time to gather others
of similar height and build around her.]

812
00:48:38,116 --> 00:48:40,437
- Hello.
- Hello, Ji Hyo.

813
00:48:40,438 --> 00:48:43,775
- You're not Korean, are you?
- No, we're Vietnamese.

814
00:48:43,776 --> 00:48:45,448
Will you help me?

815
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:47,498
- Please take good care of me.
- Nice to meet you.

816
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:49,642
It's nice to meet you... nice to meet you.

817
00:48:49,643 --> 00:48:50,686
First...

818
00:48:50,687 --> 00:48:52,763
Just keep walking like this...

819
00:48:52,764 --> 00:48:55,718
and when I give you the signal,
pair up in two's and walk around him.

820
00:48:56,237 --> 00:48:58,857
Understand?
Walk in a group and first, then in two's.

821
00:48:59,244 --> 00:49:03,355
And if Ha Dong Hoon is about to see me,
hide me by gathering around me.

822
00:49:03,567 --> 00:49:04,606
But...

823
00:49:04,607 --> 00:49:07,322
- We can't make it too obvious, okay?
- Yes.

824
00:49:08,790 --> 00:49:10,140
Let's go.

825
00:49:13,095 --> 00:49:16,456
[Ace Ji Hyo finally starts
her plan to infiltrate!]

826
00:49:17,747 --> 00:49:20,669
<i>Ha Dong Hoon... you're dead.</i>

827
00:49:23,964 --> 00:49:27,800
As for you two...
start searching for Kang Gary.

828
00:49:28,586 --> 00:49:31,698
Once you find out his location,
alert me with a signal. Understood?

829
00:49:32,912 --> 00:49:35,778
[Loyal keepers of the
ultimate golden sword.]

830
00:49:36,508 --> 00:49:39,064
And you will act exactly as I do, understood?

831
00:49:57,410 --> 00:49:58,789
Why aren't you following my lead?

832
00:49:59,778 --> 00:50:01,100
You will follow my lead.

833
00:50:01,575 --> 00:50:03,601
I'm not in the best mood
at the moment.

834
00:50:10,772 --> 00:50:11,850
I'm sorry.

835
00:50:12,693 --> 00:50:14,522
I'm sorry.
I'm sure you must be hot.

836
00:50:15,459 --> 00:50:17,151
We will now search for Kang Gary.

837
00:50:17,152 --> 00:50:18,275
Let's go.

838
00:50:20,015 --> 00:50:23,570
Nobody knows how much of this
ultimate power I have left.

839
00:50:23,848 --> 00:50:27,100
Even if I use the power now...
they're going to keep being afraid of me.

840
00:50:29,609 --> 00:50:31,357
Let's eliminate Gary first.

841
00:50:33,827 --> 00:50:35,139
He's heading this way.

842
00:50:40,737 --> 00:50:45,653
[Hiding herself behind the tree...]

843
00:50:50,508 --> 00:50:53,662
[Ji Hyo is starting to close in.]

844
00:50:54,033 --> 00:50:55,870
<i>Ha Dong Hoon... you're a dead man.</i>

845
00:51:00,882 --> 00:51:05,313
[Suk Jin is also secretly
making his approach.]

846
00:51:05,314 --> 00:51:06,498
Suk Jin!

847
00:51:06,889 --> 00:51:08,098
Suk Jin, come over here.

848
00:51:08,391 --> 00:51:10,000
I promise that I'm not going to kill you.

849
00:51:10,001 --> 00:51:11,855
I'm seriously not going to kill you,
so come here quickly.

850
00:51:12,224 --> 00:51:15,710
Suk Jin... if you don't come in five seconds,
I'm only going to come chasing after you.

851
00:51:15,710 --> 00:51:19,063
- Five, four, three...
- Hey, Dong Hoon...

852
00:51:19,398 --> 00:51:21,490
- Two... one.
- I'm here.

853
00:51:23,114 --> 00:51:26,969
<i>Okay... I'm going to walk up to you.
I promise that I won't eliminate you.</i>

854
00:51:26,970 --> 00:51:28,921
- I promise.
- Okay, with your future on the line.

855
00:51:28,922 --> 00:51:31,327
It's race start.
Do you understand?

856
00:51:31,328 --> 00:51:33,188
Okay, here we go.
We are now on the same team.

857
00:51:33,189 --> 00:51:34,813
- Thank you.
- Who's team are you on?

858
00:51:34,814 --> 00:51:36,456
I'm on Master Ha Ha's team.

859
00:51:36,868 --> 00:51:39,841
The one and only Ha Ha!
Ha Ha is the road to our salvation!

860
00:51:42,257 --> 00:51:44,174
So they're sticking together?

861
00:51:45,285 --> 00:51:48,915
[Ace Ji Hyo continuing to
move in on Ha Ha.]

862
00:51:51,616 --> 00:51:56,195
[Monday Couple's Gary also completes
his plan to sneak attack!]

863
00:51:56,196 --> 00:51:58,275
From this point on,
I'm going after Kang Gary.

864
00:51:58,275 --> 00:52:01,800
- Yes, I will help you.
- Go over there and grab Kang Gary.

865
00:52:02,152 --> 00:52:05,051
- Me?
- Then I will save you 'til last.

866
00:52:05,052 --> 00:52:06,571
You want me to grab him and
hold onto him?

867
00:52:07,685 --> 00:52:09,877
- I understand.
- I think I just saw him go that way.

868
00:52:09,983 --> 00:52:11,337
While I'm...

869
00:52:12,085 --> 00:52:14,653
Move quickly while I'm still
speaking to you in honorifics.

870
00:52:14,654 --> 00:52:18,189
Quickly... while I'm still using honorifics,
and giving you respect.

871
00:52:18,190 --> 00:52:19,909
I'm starting to get a little angry.

872
00:52:20,492 --> 00:52:21,921
You're getting what?
Wait a minute...

873
00:52:22,809 --> 00:52:24,551
I said, my loyalty to you is
getting stronger.

874
00:52:25,677 --> 00:52:28,774
[Can't even say anything
because of the ultimate golden sword.]

875
00:52:28,775 --> 00:52:30,642
Okay, this will be your test.

876
00:52:32,950 --> 00:52:35,828
All the traitors really are alike.

877
00:52:35,829 --> 00:52:37,894
I just really want to get rid of him.

878
00:52:39,095 --> 00:52:41,655
[Where are you, Kang Gary?]

879
00:52:47,090 --> 00:52:48,902
<i>Halt!</i>

880
00:52:50,215 --> 00:52:53,571
[Ha Ha chants out, 'Halt'
as he pulls out the sword!]

881
00:52:54,314 --> 00:52:55,479
Let go of me!

882
00:52:55,643 --> 00:52:58,492
- Let go of me!
- I shall do this where others can see.

883
00:52:58,692 --> 00:53:01,958
[Crazed Haroro is planning on making
a public execution this time as well.]

884
00:53:03,763 --> 00:53:05,847
[What to do!]

885
00:53:08,603 --> 00:53:09,873
What's going on?
What's going on?

886
00:53:09,874 --> 00:53:11,452
What is that?
Is Gary getting ousted?

887
00:53:11,453 --> 00:53:13,394
[Gary's been caught...
I can't just stand by and watch again!]

888
00:53:19,883 --> 00:53:21,320
Let go of me!

889
00:53:21,862 --> 00:53:23,045
Let go!

890
00:53:24,049 --> 00:53:28,687
Just what is that sword... just what is it
for you to be doing this to me?

891
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:32,028
Okay... so that everyone
around here can see...

892
00:53:32,029 --> 00:53:33,647
Get him down on his knees.

893
00:53:34,829 --> 00:53:37,245
Good job.
You did good corralling him.

894
00:53:38,263 --> 00:53:41,937
[Ji Hyo...
come quickly and save me...]

895
00:53:41,937 --> 00:53:43,107
Let go of me!

896
00:53:44,171 --> 00:53:45,798
- I said, let go of me!
- Everyone gather around.

897
00:53:46,635 --> 00:53:50,149
[Hang on just a little bit longer...
I'm coming...]

898
00:53:50,474 --> 00:53:51,664
<i>I am...</i>

899
00:53:51,665 --> 00:53:54,003
Black... uh...

900
00:53:54,004 --> 00:53:56,324
Black Knife...

901
00:53:57,192 --> 00:53:58,571
how to do you say 'Lord' in English?

902
00:53:58,606 --> 00:54:01,613
- King, King... let's just go with King.
- King!

903
00:54:02,989 --> 00:54:06,267
[Just then!]

904
00:54:06,267 --> 00:54:09,267
[Ace Ji Hyo completes moving in on Ha Ha!]

905
00:54:12,978 --> 00:54:14,662
[She's here.]

906
00:54:14,771 --> 00:54:16,390
Everyone look at me.

907
00:54:23,225 --> 00:54:25,433
[Ace Ji Hyo's ambush fails!]

908
00:54:26,220 --> 00:54:28,792
[This is their only chance!
Everyone move in on the attack!]

909
00:54:28,792 --> 00:54:30,039
Suk Jin, hurry up and rip it off!

910
00:54:32,589 --> 00:54:33,824
Suk Jin, hurry up and rip it off!

911
00:54:41,476 --> 00:54:44,778
[How... can this be...]

912
00:54:45,802 --> 00:54:51,794
[Now... the beholder of
the ultimate sword is about to change!]

913
00:54:52,622 --> 00:54:54,197
I lost my chance to rip it off!

914
00:54:54,676 --> 00:54:58,006
Jae Suk, I didn't get to rip it off,
and Suk Jin ended up ripping it off.

915
00:54:58,007 --> 00:55:00,285
We're in trouble...
we're in trouble now.

916
00:55:02,482 --> 00:55:06,922
- Let go of me... let go!
- My world is here!

917
00:55:06,923 --> 00:55:09,772
My world is here!

918
00:55:10,877 --> 00:55:13,081
Suk Jin!
How could you do this to me?

919
00:55:13,082 --> 00:55:14,672
This is how the world goes round!

920
00:55:14,673 --> 00:55:19,782
[The one who lusts after the sword...
gets destroyed by the sword...]

921
00:55:21,952 --> 00:55:26,775
[The new owner of
the ultimate golden sword... Ji Suk Jin.]

922
00:55:28,058 --> 00:55:30,158
[The power of the golden sword changes
depending on the owner.]

923
00:55:30,158 --> 00:55:32,215
[What could be the sword's new power?]

924
00:55:32,419 --> 00:55:33,523
<i>[The grim reaper's hand]</i>

925
00:55:33,523 --> 00:55:36,845
<i>[If your gloved hand touches the name tag
as you shout out 'Grim Reaper's hand'...]</i>

926
00:55:36,845 --> 00:55:39,506
<i>[that person will be ousted even if
you don't rip off the name tag.]</i>

927
00:55:40,219 --> 00:55:42,023
As long as my hand touches it.

928
00:55:42,359 --> 00:55:44,473
It means touch is out.

929
00:55:45,667 --> 00:55:47,203
The grim reaper's hand.

930
00:55:47,359 --> 00:55:51,602
[The power of the ultimate golden sword
changes depending on the beholder.]

931
00:55:54,004 --> 00:55:55,987
The Grim Reaper's Hand!

932
00:55:56,823 --> 00:56:02,334
[Will Suk Jin use the sword's power
to win the race?]

933
00:56:02,823 --> 00:56:05,535
[Worried...]

934
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:09,060
I have no idea what's going on.

935
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:15,321
[Like a clueless young daughter of a family
who married and moved down to the country...]

936
00:56:15,321 --> 00:56:19,044
[and getting caught in total chaos with
her brothers who are down for a rare visit.]

937
00:56:19,044 --> 00:56:20,996
With her younger brother
Dong Wook in town...

938
00:56:20,997 --> 00:56:24,494
My old husband now has
the ultimate power.

939
00:56:25,625 --> 00:56:27,253
He's my rich husband.

940
00:56:27,254 --> 00:56:29,922
[Rich husband?]

941
00:56:30,996 --> 00:56:33,912
[What does she do about her
husband now?]

942
00:56:34,909 --> 00:56:36,322
<i>Hello, Jong Kook!</i>

943
00:56:36,614 --> 00:56:38,463
Kwang Soo... hi!

944
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:41,066
Come over here.

945
00:56:41,491 --> 00:56:43,336
Why... me?

946
00:56:43,699 --> 00:56:46,618
This kid... picked you out.

947
00:56:50,883 --> 00:56:53,686
Now that the sword is gone...
that poisonous effect on me is gone.

948
00:56:53,687 --> 00:56:55,239
[He's back to being nice
now that the sword is gone?]

949
00:56:55,240 --> 00:56:57,636
Suk Jin now has the sword
after having betrayed me.

950
00:56:57,928 --> 00:57:01,201
Suk Jin... I bet he'll be like me.
If anything, he'll be worse than me.

951
00:57:01,201 --> 00:57:02,739
So stop being angry now.

952
00:57:03,513 --> 00:57:06,449
Okay... I'll start behaving like
I've been taught by the textbook.

953
00:57:07,403 --> 00:57:08,533
I'm sorry.

954
00:57:11,638 --> 00:57:13,290
Jong Kook, that really hurts!

955
00:57:17,288 --> 00:57:18,680
It's okay, my friend.

956
00:57:18,681 --> 00:57:19,872
Thank you.

957
00:57:25,799 --> 00:57:27,313
Big-nose power!

958
00:57:28,262 --> 00:57:31,123
Big-nose... power!

959
00:57:33,802 --> 00:57:36,357
I am Big-nose power!

960
00:57:36,748 --> 00:57:40,948
Big-nose power... the moment
my hand touches you, you're out...

961
00:57:41,588 --> 00:57:43,650
Big-nose power!

962
00:57:43,651 --> 00:57:45,610
Big-nose power!

963
00:57:45,611 --> 00:57:48,744
[Huh? A cow in the middle of the road?]

964
00:57:49,659 --> 00:57:51,395
Big-nose power!

965
00:57:51,743 --> 00:57:56,836
[Conversing with the man
through the song?]

966
00:57:56,836 --> 00:57:58,426
[Look at him having fun...]

967
00:57:58,426 --> 00:58:01,403
[It seems he's asking Suk Jin to ride the cow
and get a souvenir picture taken.]

968
00:58:01,866 --> 00:58:04,848
[Since he's in a good mood anyways,
why not?]

969
00:58:08,649 --> 00:58:12,288
[With the ultimate golden sword in his hand,
he's feeling like a triumphant general!]

970
00:58:19,104 --> 00:58:20,646
Does he normally do that?

971
00:58:22,594 --> 00:58:25,125
I'm sorry but he keeps
hitting me with his tail.

972
00:58:29,066 --> 00:58:34,903
[Thinking more and more...
that he shouldn't have gotten on it.]

973
00:58:34,904 --> 00:58:37,219
His back is so sharp
that it's poking into me.

974
00:58:37,220 --> 00:58:41,028
[Triumphant General shouldn't have
been so jubilant...]

975
00:58:41,029 --> 00:58:42,717
Hey, stop hitting me with your tail!

976
00:58:45,787 --> 00:58:48,641
What a riot...
What an ultimate power he has.

977
00:58:49,406 --> 00:58:52,062
From this point on,
this is the Big-nose's world!

978
00:58:52,337 --> 00:58:54,290
Follow me!

979
00:58:56,048 --> 00:58:58,163
Big-nose power!

980
00:58:59,070 --> 00:59:01,150
<i>The world of Big-nose!</i>

981
00:59:01,151 --> 00:59:04,734
- He's calling himself Big-nose?
- What's with Big-nose power?

982
00:59:05,966 --> 00:59:08,032
- Big-nose power!
- Big-nose power!

983
00:59:08,033 --> 00:59:09,033
<i>What is that?</i>

984
00:59:09,034 --> 00:59:10,558
<i>What's Big-nose power?</i>

985
00:59:20,018 --> 00:59:21,442
[After only three minutes...]

986
00:59:21,442 --> 00:59:26,576
[Time of Big-nose's reign
comes to an end.]

987
00:59:26,577 --> 00:59:30,209
[We can't stand to listen to
Big-nose power!]

988
00:59:34,396 --> 00:59:37,165
- Dong Wook...
- Did you think I'd let you keep it?

989
00:59:44,408 --> 00:59:46,900
He didn't even get to do anything!

990
00:59:47,867 --> 00:59:50,030
Wow... he really looks so pathetic.

991
00:59:52,045 --> 00:59:53,488
Wait...

992
00:59:53,489 --> 00:59:57,057
Why is he even riding the cow?
He should be rushing to oust people.

993
00:59:58,870 --> 01:00:00,762
Wow, now Dong Wook has the sword?

994
01:00:02,009 --> 01:00:05,937
[Nervousness escalating with
the sword now in Dong Wook's hand.]

995
01:00:05,938 --> 01:00:08,884
<i>When Suk Jin had it,
it was like a rest period.</i>

996
01:00:09,406 --> 01:00:11,276
You really throw fastballs
with the things you say.

997
01:00:11,277 --> 01:00:13,004
You don't mince your words.

998
01:00:14,034 --> 01:00:15,984
You really are a fast ball thrower.

999
01:00:17,970 --> 01:00:22,481
[The spectators curious about his power
since they never got to see it in action.]

1000
01:00:23,062 --> 01:00:28,704
[The grim reaper's hand was a good power...
Just one touch on the name tag, and it's out.]

1001
01:00:28,704 --> 01:00:30,804
- It was awesome power.
- You should've used it.

1002
01:00:30,804 --> 01:00:32,966
Suk Jin... if you'd done it...
try it out on me.

1003
01:00:32,967 --> 01:00:35,181
Put your hand on my back
as if you're going to eliminate me.

1004
01:00:35,182 --> 01:00:36,669
- I'll do this...
- Okay, give it a try.

1005
01:00:37,617 --> 01:00:39,218
- See, I touched it.
- But it was your other hand.

1006
01:00:43,343 --> 01:00:46,278
[What's this?
You can't even budge?]

1007
01:00:46,279 --> 01:00:48,480
I would've given you a break
and not come after you.

1008
01:00:49,916 --> 01:00:53,216
[That's you giving him a break?]

1009
01:00:55,060 --> 01:00:59,264
[If it went the other way around,
he could've eliminated his own name tag?]

1010
01:01:00,185 --> 01:01:01,711
I would've targeted either
Hye Jin or Ji Hyo.

1011
01:01:03,537 --> 01:01:07,215
Big-nose's power only targets the girls?

1012
01:01:08,903 --> 01:01:13,138
[Golden sword's third owner, Dong Wook...
What will the power be this time?]

1013
01:01:13,139 --> 01:01:14,266
I need to check the power.

1014
01:01:18,521 --> 01:01:21,890
<i>[If you shout out, 'Cloning power',
all the name tags of the remaining survivors...</i>

1015
01:01:21,891 --> 01:01:24,831
<i>will be swapped out
for a single person's name tag.]</i>

1016
01:01:24,831 --> 01:01:25,952
<i>[This power can only be used once.]</i>

1017
01:01:26,948 --> 01:01:28,020
Wait...

1018
01:01:29,799 --> 01:01:33,637
In that case... if I for example...

1019
01:01:33,869 --> 01:01:36,042
If I shout out Han Hye Jin's name,
then everyone will have her name tag?

1020
01:01:36,043 --> 01:01:38,655
[If he shouts out Han Hye Jin's name,
everyone's name tag will be swapped out.]

1021
01:01:38,655 --> 01:01:39,794
Listen...

1022
01:01:39,795 --> 01:01:43,225
Some people get easy powers like
having to just say, 'Halt'...

1023
01:01:43,506 --> 01:01:46,109
What is this?
This is too hard...

1024
01:01:46,651 --> 01:01:47,952
Should I just try it now?

1025
01:01:48,315 --> 01:01:49,775
Can I shout it out from here?

1026
01:01:49,776 --> 01:01:52,946
[Why not think about it some more?
You only have one chance!]

1027
01:01:56,074 --> 01:02:00,427
[Think about when and
who you're going to use it for...]

1028
01:02:00,428 --> 01:02:01,879
I need a quiet place to think.

1029
01:02:05,170 --> 01:02:09,378
[What special power did he receive?]

1030
01:02:10,271 --> 01:02:12,484
[This is making me nervous...]

1031
01:02:12,872 --> 01:02:14,748
- Gary!
- You startled me.

1032
01:02:16,652 --> 01:02:18,866
- What are you doing here?
- I have no idea what's going on.

1033
01:02:18,867 --> 01:02:22,062
[Since they don't know the power Dong Wook
has, they're unable to approach him easily.]

1034
01:02:22,701 --> 01:02:23,949
For example...

1035
01:02:23,950 --> 01:02:26,479
If I shout out Gary's name,
and everyone gets Gary's name tag...

1036
01:02:27,176 --> 01:02:30,344
no matter who's back I rip it off of,
then Gary is ousted.

1037
01:02:32,680 --> 01:02:33,995
Let's give it a try.

1038
01:02:37,541 --> 01:02:39,073
Cloning power...

1039
01:02:40,710 --> 01:02:45,504
[Because he's not saying it loud enough,
the power isn't being activated!]

1040
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:47,664
Cloning power!

1041
01:02:58,248 --> 01:03:00,353
Cloning power!

1042
01:03:00,821 --> 01:03:02,498
Kang Gary!

1043
01:03:03,618 --> 01:03:05,504
<i>Cloning power!</i>

1044
01:03:06,066 --> 01:03:07,627
<i>Kang Gary!</i>

1045
01:03:08,370 --> 01:03:09,709
Kang Gary?

1046
01:03:11,084 --> 01:03:12,612
<i>Kang Gary!</i>

1047
01:03:12,613 --> 01:03:14,012
He just called out my name!

1048
01:03:14,721 --> 01:03:16,303
Why is he doing that?

1049
01:03:17,166 --> 01:03:19,671
He just did something and
shouted out Kang Gary's name.

1050
01:03:21,212 --> 01:03:23,644
[Huh?]

1051
01:03:30,689 --> 01:03:34,416
[Ji Hyo's name tag... changed into 'Gary'!]

1052
01:03:34,416 --> 01:03:35,994
He's changing out all the name tags?

1053
01:03:35,995 --> 01:03:37,456
That means... wait...

1054
01:03:37,457 --> 01:03:38,777
- What happens to me then?
- That's not it.

1055
01:03:38,777 --> 01:03:40,783
It means that everyone's name tag
is becoming 'Gary'.

1056
01:03:49,740 --> 01:03:52,393
[Hye Jin's name tag also gets
cloned to Gary's name!]

1057
01:03:52,393 --> 01:03:55,699
- If Gary gets caught...
- Ah, then everyone becomes Kang Gary.

1058
01:03:55,973 --> 01:03:58,161
[And over here,
you have your Gary the grasshopper.]

1059
01:03:58,162 --> 01:04:02,213
[Ultimately, no matter who gets ripped off,
it's Gary getting ousted.]

1060
01:04:06,081 --> 01:04:07,704
I'm right here!

1061
01:04:13,245 --> 01:04:15,119
I'm right here!

1062
01:04:16,003 --> 01:04:17,469
Over here!

1063
01:04:18,399 --> 01:04:20,069
Over here!

1064
01:04:20,667 --> 01:04:22,191
I'm Gary!

1065
01:04:23,292 --> 01:04:26,316
- No! I'm Gary!
- I'm Gary.

1066
01:04:26,317 --> 01:04:29,863
[Service right to his doorsteps.
Everyone delivering their tags to him.]

1067
01:04:31,147 --> 01:04:33,011
What are they doing?

1068
01:04:33,424 --> 01:04:35,867
Wait... no matter who gets ousted,
I'm the one getting eliminated?

1069
01:04:35,868 --> 01:04:38,631
That's right! No matter who it is,
Kang Gary is the one eliminated!

1070
01:04:38,632 --> 01:04:41,344
[Right now, everyone's Gary.
No matter who's ripped off, Gary gets ousted!]

1071
01:04:41,344 --> 01:04:42,520
You can't!

1072
01:04:43,804 --> 01:04:47,354
I'm right here!
Kang Gary's right here!

1073
01:04:48,302 --> 01:04:51,584
[In front of Dong Wook are
two other Gary's already.]

1074
01:04:51,585 --> 01:04:54,177
- Gary, don't come here!
- I'm Gary!

1075
01:04:54,178 --> 01:04:56,918
I'm Gary...
I'm Gary!

1076
01:04:56,919 --> 01:04:59,272
- Why are you raising your hands?
- I'm Gary.

1077
01:04:59,465 --> 01:05:02,293
[Even the original Gary
arrives on the scene.]

1078
01:05:02,293 --> 01:05:03,682
Why are you all saying that you're me?

1079
01:05:03,683 --> 01:05:05,209
- I'm...
- I'm Gary.

1080
01:05:05,210 --> 01:05:08,600
I'm the one...
I'm the Gary that lives in Jamsil!

1081
01:05:08,601 --> 01:05:10,544
- Why are you doing this to me?
- Okay, okay...

1082
01:05:10,545 --> 01:05:12,876
- What are you talking about?
- I'm Kang Gary!

1083
01:05:12,877 --> 01:05:15,200
- Everyone...
- Why are you all imitating me?

1084
01:05:15,201 --> 01:05:18,102
[Blank Ji breaking down to do
Gary's signature dance.]

1085
01:05:18,103 --> 01:05:22,161
Look here...
only I can dance that dance!

1086
01:05:22,162 --> 01:05:24,697
I can do it too... I can do the dance too!

1087
01:05:26,869 --> 01:05:28,413
[Even Hye Jin is moving her leg.]

1088
01:05:29,449 --> 01:05:30,659
I can do it too!

1089
01:05:30,660 --> 01:05:32,331
I can do it too!

1090
01:05:32,332 --> 01:05:35,101
- I'm Gary... I'm Gary too.
- Stop!

1091
01:05:35,102 --> 01:05:38,831
I'm the real Gary. Even though
you've all now become Gary...

1092
01:05:39,149 --> 01:05:42,055
in a few moments,
you can all become Song Ji Hyo!

1093
01:05:42,056 --> 01:05:45,536
And after that,
you can all become Yoo Jae Suk too.

1094
01:05:45,537 --> 01:05:47,260
- I'm Gary.
- I'm the real Gary!

1095
01:05:47,261 --> 01:05:49,207
[All the Gary's not able to communicate
with one another.]

1096
01:05:49,208 --> 01:05:51,069
I'm the real Gary!

1097
01:05:51,070 --> 01:05:53,224
- Don't be like this!
- Wait... everyone...

1098
01:05:53,225 --> 01:05:56,973
Why did you have to give me
such a useless power as this?

1099
01:05:57,250 --> 01:05:59,727
What is this?
What kind of a power is this?

1100
01:06:00,526 --> 01:06:02,555
Even when I bungee jumped,
I was left feeling unsatisfied.

1101
01:06:02,556 --> 01:06:04,498
And all I did since coming on Running Man
was lose weight.

1102
01:06:05,237 --> 01:06:07,914
- You're all shouting that you're Gary..
- I'm telling you, I'm Gary!

1103
01:06:07,915 --> 01:06:10,574
- Then why don't you be Gary too?
- I'm Gary too!

1104
01:06:11,366 --> 01:06:12,834
I'm Gary too!

1105
01:06:12,835 --> 01:06:14,430
[You wanted to be included too, huh?]

1106
01:06:15,856 --> 01:06:17,508
I'm Gary too!

1107
01:06:17,800 --> 01:06:19,951
- I'm Gary too!
- We're all Gary!

1108
01:06:20,577 --> 01:06:23,645
[Five Gary group dance.]

1109
01:06:23,645 --> 01:06:26,791
[That aside, when is Gary going
to be ousted?]

1110
01:06:28,368 --> 01:06:29,926
Don't do that!

1111
01:06:29,927 --> 01:06:31,880
Why are you trying to rip that off?

1112
01:06:31,881 --> 01:06:35,527
[Gary protecting Jae Suk
so that he can survive.]

1113
01:06:35,924 --> 01:06:38,556
- You're trying to save me...
- I'm Gary!

1114
01:06:39,104 --> 01:06:40,920
Don't be like this!
What are you doing?

1115
01:06:41,941 --> 01:06:43,161
<i>This is my choice.</i>

1116
01:06:43,162 --> 01:06:45,809
This is so annoying.
Maybe I should change the name.

1117
01:06:46,317 --> 01:06:48,563
- Hurry up and rip off his name.
- Should I go with Yoo Jae Suk this time?

1118
01:06:51,691 --> 01:06:53,223
Yoo Jae Suk's right here!

1119
01:06:53,496 --> 01:06:55,092
I'm Yoo Jae Suk!

1120
01:06:59,814 --> 01:07:02,582
[Feeling in danger, Jae Suk
quickly eliminates Gary's name tag!]

1121
01:07:02,582 --> 01:07:05,178
[Gary, Out!]

1122
01:07:06,354 --> 01:07:11,375
[From having dragged out all that time,
Jae Suk ousts Gary instead of Dong Wook!]

1123
01:07:11,376 --> 01:07:14,115
Yoo Jae Suk is going to be next...
and after that will be Song Ji Hyo!

1124
01:07:14,115 --> 01:07:16,318
- Go away!
- I'm the real Gary!

1125
01:07:16,583 --> 01:07:20,681
[The ultimate power...
angry for never having even possessed it!]

1126
01:07:23,049 --> 01:07:25,587
- The sword now belongs to Yoo Jae Suk.
- Why?

1127
01:07:27,379 --> 01:07:30,199
[Dong Wook already used up all the power
that the sword had to offer him.]

1128
01:07:30,199 --> 01:07:33,764
[Since Jae Suk ousted Gary instead of
Dong Wook, he's now the new owner.]

1129
01:07:34,935 --> 01:07:38,243
You're saying... that the sword is mine?

1130
01:07:40,529 --> 01:07:43,010
[What luck is this!]

1131
01:07:43,011 --> 01:07:44,326
Hand it over.

1132
01:07:45,882 --> 01:07:48,178
[I should've been quicker to rip it off...]

1133
01:07:49,030 --> 01:07:50,326
Dong Wook...

1134
01:07:51,255 --> 01:07:52,495
The fool!

1135
01:07:53,393 --> 01:07:55,007
From this moment, in this place...

1136
01:07:56,195 --> 01:07:59,540
a bloody revenge is going to ensue.

1137
01:08:01,449 --> 01:08:03,857
[The new owner of the sword...]

1138
01:08:03,857 --> 01:08:07,672
[The time for Jae Suk's reign has begun.]

1139
01:08:14,104 --> 01:08:15,999
Unbelievable.

1140
01:08:16,862 --> 01:08:20,272
I'm the ruler of this land!

1141
01:08:20,273 --> 01:08:22,231
Prepare yourselves!

1142
01:08:23,910 --> 01:08:25,514
Summon the spirits?

1143
01:08:25,515 --> 01:08:28,662
<i>[If you shout out 'summon the spirit',
one of the eliminated people can be</i>

1144
01:08:28,662 --> 01:08:30,204
<i>resurrected and will become
your servant to order around.</i>

1145
01:08:30,204 --> 01:08:33,655
<i>But they can't eliminate anyone for you,
and will disappear after a given time.]</i>

1146
01:08:35,828 --> 01:08:38,311
[There's a time limit!
However, the time limit is for 20 minutes!]

1147
01:08:38,311 --> 01:08:39,775
<i>It's not really summoning the spirits...</i>

1148
01:08:39,775 --> 01:08:43,782
<i>But since they have to be resurrected,
it's 'Aren't you happy?' that you'll shout.</i>

1149
01:08:43,782 --> 01:08:45,232
What the heck is that?

1150
01:08:46,817 --> 01:08:50,810
[With the summoning spell being so long,
he may get ousted while saying it.]

1151
01:08:50,811 --> 01:08:52,516
<i>That's what you'll have to recite.</i>

1152
01:08:53,561 --> 01:08:55,939
Why is the summon so long?

1153
01:08:57,987 --> 01:08:59,584
From this moment...

1154
01:08:59,585 --> 01:09:01,694
[Anyways, pulls out the sword...]

1155
01:09:01,694 --> 01:09:03,163
I will...

1156
01:09:04,309 --> 01:09:06,579
show you my powers!

1157
01:09:10,393 --> 01:09:12,265
What was that summon again?

1158
01:09:12,861 --> 01:09:14,546
Let's hurry it along!

1159
01:09:16,295 --> 01:09:18,348
You'll soon see my powers.

1160
01:09:18,813 --> 01:09:20,251
Lee Dong Wook...

1161
01:09:20,252 --> 01:09:22,830
Han Hye Jin...
and Blank Ji Hyo...

1162
01:09:23,458 --> 01:09:24,900
You guys are...

1163
01:09:24,901 --> 01:09:28,031
soon going to witness my powers!

1164
01:09:28,032 --> 01:09:29,741
Hurry up and do it!
What's your power?

1165
01:09:30,285 --> 01:09:32,195
<i>Okay!
I'll do it!</i>

1166
01:09:33,922 --> 01:09:35,415
Hear me!

1167
01:09:35,416 --> 01:09:39,951
To be resurrected once again...
aren't you so happy?

1168
01:09:39,952 --> 01:09:43,157
[To be resurrected once again...
aren't you so happy?]

1169
01:09:43,158 --> 01:09:47,021
I summon the spirits!

1170
01:09:48,443 --> 01:09:52,069
[Summon of the spirits activated!]

1171
01:09:54,425 --> 01:09:58,269
[Just what does that power consist of?]

1172
01:10:00,754 --> 01:10:04,388
[Who from jail will be resurrected?]

1173
01:10:04,389 --> 01:10:06,153
Jong Kook is supposed to come.

1174
01:10:07,700 --> 01:10:08,871
What the heck?

1175
01:10:09,603 --> 01:10:11,027
Him?

1176
01:10:11,613 --> 01:10:15,508
[Summon of the spirits-
One of the prisoners are resurrected!]

1177
01:10:15,508 --> 01:10:17,533
Why is it Lee Kwang Soo?

1178
01:10:17,534 --> 01:10:20,953
Yoo Jae Suk!
Yoo Jae Suk!

1179
01:10:20,954 --> 01:10:25,402
All together!
Yoo Jae Suk! Yoo Jae Suk!

1180
01:10:25,403 --> 01:10:28,905
<i>Yoo Jae Suk!
Louder!</i>

1181
01:10:31,019 --> 01:10:34,153
[Ghost Giraffe excited about having
been let out of jail for the moment.]

1182
01:10:34,857 --> 01:10:36,041
Everyone...

1183
01:10:36,477 --> 01:10:41,117
How tired you must be from
having walked around all this time!

1184
01:10:41,118 --> 01:10:43,157
- Thank you.
- Now that I have the power...

1185
01:10:43,158 --> 01:10:48,283
I will oust everyone so that
I can send all of you home to rest!

1186
01:10:51,059 --> 01:10:53,773
I will make it so that you will
all return home shortly!

1187
01:10:54,403 --> 01:10:56,193
Yes... I'll do that.

1188
01:10:57,582 --> 01:10:59,643
I will promise you!

1189
01:11:01,573 --> 01:11:03,943
Not now, not now.
No now!

1190
01:11:03,944 --> 01:11:06,011
No now, no now...

1191
01:11:06,324 --> 01:11:07,757
Yes, yes...

1192
01:11:09,949 --> 01:11:14,663
- What... Yoo Jae Suk!
- Now's not the time for that.

1193
01:11:16,638 --> 01:11:19,709
What is going on over there?
Did someone get resurrected?

1194
01:11:20,153 --> 01:11:23,973
- So he has the power of resurrection?
- Yeah, he brought someone back.

1195
01:11:23,974 --> 01:11:26,797
[As mentioned, a power to resurrect!
Just how will he use that power?]

1196
01:11:26,798 --> 01:11:28,692
I think he's able to utilize someone.

1197
01:11:30,876 --> 01:11:32,874
- Are you ready?
- Yes, I'm ready.

1198
01:11:33,640 --> 01:11:35,801
If Yoo Jae Suk can oust someone
within 20 minutes...

1199
01:11:35,801 --> 01:11:38,407
- you can summon your next spirit.
- Really?

1200
01:11:38,791 --> 01:11:41,291
However... if you can't oust anyone
within that given time...

1201
01:11:41,291 --> 01:11:43,003
even Lee Kwang Soo's spirit
will be lost.

1202
01:11:43,004 --> 01:11:45,189
Then my life is the length of a fruit fly?

1203
01:11:45,189 --> 01:11:47,445
We only need three more.
Ha Ha... no, not Ha Ha.

1204
01:11:48,461 --> 01:11:50,255
Don't you think you have to
treat me well too?

1205
01:11:50,439 --> 01:11:52,841
- What did you say?
- Treat me well if you want to survive.

1206
01:11:53,027 --> 01:11:54,812
- Take that off.
- No, I didn't mean it.

1207
01:11:54,813 --> 01:11:57,033
- Take that off.
- No, I didn't mean it.

1208
01:11:59,089 --> 01:12:02,449
I called you out here since you've had
nothing to do but sit around all day...

1209
01:12:02,450 --> 01:12:04,913
[How dare he after he was rescued from
having been in jail all day...]

1210
01:12:04,914 --> 01:12:09,697
<i>Yoo Jae Suk!
Yoo Jae Suk!</i>

1211
01:12:09,698 --> 01:12:11,787
- Let's go.
- Want to just keep sitting around in there?

1212
01:12:11,788 --> 01:12:13,056
No, Sir.

1213
01:12:13,057 --> 01:12:15,621
- Do you promise to do your best to serve me?
- Yes, I promise!

1214
01:12:16,033 --> 01:12:17,082
Okay.

1215
01:12:22,791 --> 01:12:25,848
From this point on...
I appoint you as my servant.

1216
01:12:25,849 --> 01:12:28,041
- Thank you.
- And if any gold is to be earned today...

1217
01:12:28,042 --> 01:12:30,933
- It will be yours!
- Thank you!

1218
01:12:30,934 --> 01:12:32,089
Go!

1219
01:12:32,855 --> 01:12:35,643
Don't walk in front of me.

1220
01:12:37,145 --> 01:12:39,123
[Seriously...]

1221
01:12:39,123 --> 01:12:40,975
Don't you think you're being too much?

1222
01:12:40,976 --> 01:12:42,750
- Take it off.
- Okay.

1223
01:12:42,751 --> 01:12:44,105
Please lead the way!

1224
01:12:44,593 --> 01:12:46,318
Don't step on my shadow either.

1225
01:12:49,020 --> 01:12:50,430
- Kwang Soo...
- Yes, Jae Suk?

1226
01:12:50,431 --> 01:12:51,555
Where's Dong Wook?

1227
01:12:52,567 --> 01:12:53,669
Wait.

1228
01:12:54,313 --> 01:12:57,570
I need to get up high...
and take a look to see where they're at.

1229
01:13:00,091 --> 01:13:01,820
- Up to the castle?
- Up on your shoulders.

1230
01:13:03,109 --> 01:13:04,956
- So I'm the high place?
- I have to get up high to see.

1231
01:13:04,957 --> 01:13:07,381
I have to take a look around
this wide open space...

1232
01:13:07,382 --> 01:13:08,689
so that I can see where they're at.

1233
01:13:08,690 --> 01:13:10,637
- Then why don't we climb up somewhere?
- Hurry up and lift me up.

1234
01:13:12,087 --> 01:13:13,331
Hurry.

1235
01:13:15,038 --> 01:13:17,023
I have to get up high to see.

1236
01:13:17,024 --> 01:13:19,438
This isn't what I'm supposed to be used for.

1237
01:13:21,849 --> 01:13:23,260
What is this?

1238
01:13:23,261 --> 01:13:24,599
Kwang Soo, where are they?

1239
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:27,155
- How can I see?
- Take a look.

1240
01:13:28,949 --> 01:13:31,209
- Hurry up and get down.
- Lee Dong Wook is...

1241
01:13:31,511 --> 01:13:32,636
Right over there.

1242
01:13:32,637 --> 01:13:34,557
- Here he comes.
- Where?

1243
01:13:34,558 --> 01:13:36,210
Down, down... Kwang Soo, set me down.

1244
01:13:36,211 --> 01:13:38,383
[Target locked]

1245
01:13:38,383 --> 01:13:40,999
[Sets on his way with his spirit!]

1246
01:13:48,083 --> 01:13:52,637
[Kwang Soo and Jae Suk rush
to close in on Dong Wook!]

1247
01:13:54,739 --> 01:13:55,919
[Giraffe the ghost grabs Dong Wook!]

1248
01:13:57,517 --> 01:14:02,654
[The power of the sword- Making the
capturing easier with the spirit's help.]

1249
01:14:09,499 --> 01:14:14,814
[Right now... is the time to attack!]

1250
01:14:20,153 --> 01:14:23,757
[All the energy being drained
by the attack of these two.]

1251
01:14:23,758 --> 01:14:25,215
- I'm so exhausted.
- If I don't eliminate you...

1252
01:14:25,216 --> 01:14:26,697
I can't survive either.

1253
01:14:26,698 --> 01:14:28,595
[If I don't eliminate you,
I can't survive either!]

1254
01:14:29,447 --> 01:14:31,941
[Wait...]

1255
01:14:32,563 --> 01:14:38,363
[If Dong Wook's name tag gets ripped off,
then I have to head back to jail.]

1256
01:14:42,024 --> 01:14:47,991
[Every word out of his mouth
is a threat to fire him...]

1257
01:14:51,047 --> 01:14:53,435
If I don't eliminate you,
I can't survive either!

1258
01:14:53,643 --> 01:14:55,225
What are you doing?

1259
01:14:58,219 --> 01:15:01,895
[Why is Giraffe the ghost suddenly
grasping Jae Suk's hands?]

1260
01:15:03,207 --> 01:15:06,159
Rather than living this crappy life...
let's just die together instead!

1261
01:15:06,779 --> 01:15:09,657
[Giraffe the ghost betrays Jae Suk!]

1262
01:15:10,303 --> 01:15:12,462
Right now!
Do it now!

1263
01:15:19,438 --> 01:15:22,462
[And Hye Jin follows up by
eliminating Dong Wook's name tag!]

1264
01:15:23,947 --> 01:15:25,320
What have you done? Come here!

1265
01:15:27,024 --> 01:15:31,959
[Giraffe the ghost is already preparing
to offer up the sword to the new owner.]

1266
01:15:31,959 --> 01:15:34,290
- I'm the new owner.
- Dong Wook, you're out?

1267
01:15:34,291 --> 01:15:35,413
I ousted him.

1268
01:15:36,492 --> 01:15:37,803
What is this!

1269
01:15:37,804 --> 01:15:40,472
[The new owner of the ultimate
golden sword is Hye Jin!]

1270
01:15:41,470 --> 01:15:45,147
- Hey... I'm your owner...
- Owners can change!

1271
01:15:45,709 --> 01:15:47,676
Have you ever treated me right
as your spirit?

1272
01:15:47,677 --> 01:15:49,660
- You dare betray me?
- Wait... wait a minute.

1273
01:15:52,102 --> 01:15:55,078
- You think I'm one of your dogs?
- Wait, Hye Jin...

1274
01:15:55,158 --> 01:15:58,203
[This guy is angry at Hye Jin.]

1275
01:15:58,575 --> 01:16:00,678
I just wanted to rip off
someone's name tag.

1276
01:16:01,245 --> 01:16:03,616
- Between the guests...
- Seriously...

1277
01:16:04,086 --> 01:16:07,051
I'm just speechless.
He was supposed to be helping me.

1278
01:16:07,052 --> 01:16:08,930
- He wasn't supposed to help you.
- Why did he do that?

1279
01:16:10,120 --> 01:16:12,186
What is he saying that I've done?

1280
01:16:12,736 --> 01:16:14,566
- Seriously...
- Wow...

1281
01:16:14,567 --> 01:16:15,780
Master!

1282
01:16:16,846 --> 01:16:18,149
Okay.

1283
01:16:20,747 --> 01:16:23,491
- So an opportunity like this finds me too.
- Lee Kwang Soo is...

1284
01:16:23,873 --> 01:16:28,757
[Giraffe ghost was originally a power
that Jae Suk activated with his sword.]

1285
01:16:28,757 --> 01:16:33,388
[His usage time is 20 minutes!
Still has 13 minutes left until expiration.]

1286
01:16:33,661 --> 01:16:36,014
I can be referred to as
your guardian angel.

1287
01:16:36,015 --> 01:16:37,474
<i>He's just a spirit.</i>

1288
01:16:37,968 --> 01:16:40,495
[Kwang Soo is a ghost or a.k.a a spirit.]

1289
01:16:40,495 --> 01:16:42,001
I'm not a ghost...

1290
01:16:43,028 --> 01:16:46,291
[Must recite the summon again
to reactivate the spirit.]

1291
01:16:46,930 --> 01:16:50,519
To be resurrected again...
aren't you so happy!

1292
01:16:50,519 --> 01:16:52,752
I've heard this before somewhere else!

1293
01:16:55,043 --> 01:16:56,159
Master!

1294
01:16:56,785 --> 01:16:58,059
I'm your spirit.

1295
01:16:58,060 --> 01:16:59,822
I'm your bodyguard.

1296
01:16:59,823 --> 01:17:01,062
Okay.

1297
01:17:01,686 --> 01:17:03,467
Where did Song Ji Hyo go?

1298
01:17:04,806 --> 01:17:08,120
- I have to find Song Ji Hyo.
- You two are the only ones left?

1299
01:17:08,121 --> 01:17:09,545
Ji Hyo is the only one left.

1300
01:17:10,110 --> 01:17:12,791
In that case...
Spirit, go and find Ji Hyo.

1301
01:17:13,320 --> 01:17:16,918
[Even though he may have a new owner,
his tasks are still the same.]

1302
01:17:21,666 --> 01:17:26,317
[Two people on the opposing side,
while she's left all alone.]

1303
01:17:29,920 --> 01:17:32,836
[How can I win this?]

1304
01:17:33,337 --> 01:17:35,449
It's so confusing because
Ji Hyo's dressed in yellow too.

1305
01:17:35,449 --> 01:17:36,763
I know, but we don't have any time.

1306
01:17:38,069 --> 01:17:42,885
[Since it can be over in a blink of an eye,
every step is taken with caution.]

1307
01:17:46,085 --> 01:17:49,366
<i>Seriously... how am I going to
fight them one against two?</i>

1308
01:17:52,414 --> 01:17:53,698
How should I do this?

1309
01:17:56,318 --> 01:17:57,602
What do I do?

1310
01:17:59,533 --> 01:18:04,868
[Her opponent is Hye Jin with the ultimate
sword and Giraffe the ghost to boot.]

1311
01:18:04,868 --> 01:18:06,889
This is no good.

1312
01:18:08,248 --> 01:18:12,576
[Okay... there's only one way...]

1313
01:18:14,073 --> 01:18:17,143
[Blank Ji suddenly moving around in a rush.]

1314
01:18:18,530 --> 01:18:19,770
Come here.

1315
01:18:23,610 --> 01:18:24,734
Come on.

1316
01:18:24,735 --> 01:18:28,989
[Ah... Blank Ji gathering around
other women who are dressed in yellow.]

1317
01:18:28,989 --> 01:18:33,670
['Hide amongst the yellow dresses!'
The same plan she tried before?]

1318
01:18:33,671 --> 01:18:36,105
[Okay, this is it.]

1319
01:18:39,980 --> 01:18:44,993
[The garden suddenly full of yellow Ao dai
by Ji Hyo's request.]

1320
01:18:47,075 --> 01:18:49,062
- If I can only eliminate Ji Hyo...
- Master!

1321
01:18:49,402 --> 01:18:50,986
Walking around by yourself is dangerous!

1322
01:18:51,973 --> 01:18:53,398
Ji Hyo!

1323
01:18:53,964 --> 01:18:55,283
Song Ji Hyo!

1324
01:18:55,656 --> 01:18:57,781
You don't even acknowledge me
when I say something to you.

1325
01:18:57,782 --> 01:18:59,877
- Huh?
- I told you it's dangerous.

1326
01:18:59,878 --> 01:19:01,490
That's right.
You're under my service, right?

1327
01:19:01,491 --> 01:19:04,148
I'm not in your service,
but I'm just helping you out!

1328
01:19:04,149 --> 01:19:05,658
Song Ji Hyo!

1329
01:19:05,659 --> 01:19:07,025
Hurry up and find Ji Hyo.

1330
01:19:07,350 --> 01:19:08,862
Where... where's Ji Hyo?

1331
01:19:09,178 --> 01:19:10,892
- Where? There?
- Is she over there?

1332
01:19:12,816 --> 01:19:15,430
[Following the instruction,
and heading towards the garden!]

1333
01:19:15,431 --> 01:19:16,762
We have to go together!

1334
01:19:16,763 --> 01:19:19,158
- Oh yeah!
- Are you going to use me or not?

1335
01:19:20,160 --> 01:19:22,057
That's right...
I keep forgetting.

1336
01:19:23,290 --> 01:19:24,510
Ji Hyo!

1337
01:19:27,750 --> 01:19:29,090
Ji Hyo!

1338
01:19:30,733 --> 01:19:32,090
Ji Hyo!

1339
01:19:33,479 --> 01:19:35,746
[I need to hide for now.]

1340
01:19:39,619 --> 01:19:43,324
[Searching every corner
of the garden for Ji Hyo.]

1341
01:19:48,808 --> 01:19:52,782
[Blank Ji is disguised under the
help of others dressed in yellow.]

1342
01:19:56,273 --> 01:20:00,261
[Will her plan go the way she hopes?]

1343
01:20:00,262 --> 01:20:01,727
- You don't see her?
- I don't see her.

1344
01:20:03,215 --> 01:20:04,821
I was told she was around here.

1345
01:20:06,345 --> 01:20:08,701
[Find Blank Ji...]

1346
01:20:10,721 --> 01:20:15,154
[She has to be around here...
I can smell something fishy going on...]

1347
01:20:17,843 --> 01:20:19,891
[That's Blank Ji!]

1348
01:20:21,987 --> 01:20:23,155
You don't see her?

1349
01:20:23,156 --> 01:20:25,158
I was told that she was
in here somewhere.

1350
01:20:25,345 --> 01:20:29,036
[But she doesn't see her,
and just walks on by...]

1351
01:20:29,036 --> 01:20:30,835
It's like finding a venomous snake
among other serpents.

1352
01:20:33,416 --> 01:20:34,641
<i>She really is the ace.</i>

1353
01:20:35,298 --> 01:20:37,581
If we still can't find her after all this,
it means she's not here, right?

1354
01:20:37,582 --> 01:20:39,575
[She has to be around here somewhere...]

1355
01:20:43,686 --> 01:20:44,961
<i>This is no good.</i>

1356
01:20:48,562 --> 01:20:54,963
[The fierce competition...
Ji Hyo vs. Hye Jin.]

1357
01:20:56,839 --> 01:21:00,467
[Will she ambush first...
or will be she discovered first?]

1358
01:21:15,595 --> 01:21:16,943
[Grabs with the right hand...]

1359
01:21:16,944 --> 01:21:18,173
[But as Hye Jin turns her body around
to avoid the attack...]

1360
01:21:18,174 --> 01:21:20,474
[Eliminates it with her left hand!]

1361
01:21:21,748 --> 01:21:24,704
[With lightning fast speed!]

1362
01:21:24,704 --> 01:21:28,641
[Song Ji Hyo... our very own Ace!]

1363
01:21:29,361 --> 01:21:32,513
- Kwang Soo! What did you do...
- Why are you doing this to me?

1364
01:21:32,514 --> 01:21:34,641
- What have you even done?
- I was searching!

1365
01:21:34,642 --> 01:21:36,304
[Looking elsewhere at that
decisive moment.]

1366
01:21:37,957 --> 01:21:39,143
Master!

1367
01:21:40,366 --> 01:21:41,883
I pledge my undying loyalty to you!

1368
01:21:41,884 --> 01:21:47,224
[The final owner of the ultimate sword is...
Song Ji Hyo!]

1369
01:21:47,895 --> 01:21:50,721
[Giraffe the ghost who ultimately
proved to be of no use to Hye Jin.]

1370
01:21:50,722 --> 01:21:54,182
- I knew it would be you from the beginning.
- As your Master, I order you back to jail.

1371
01:21:54,934 --> 01:21:56,050
Go back immediately.

1372
01:21:56,496 --> 01:21:59,402
- Hurry up and go.
- Aren't we on the same team now?

1373
01:21:59,914 --> 01:22:01,998
- What do you mean, the same team?
- I was your ally from the beginning.

1374
01:22:05,663 --> 01:22:08,454
What? Why...
why are you leading me away?

1375
01:22:08,455 --> 01:22:10,504
What are you doing?
Ji Hyo!

1376
01:22:10,505 --> 01:22:11,575
I'm sorry, Hye Jin.

1377
01:22:11,575 --> 01:22:14,383
I'd like to see you try to stick that
sword into the turtle.

1378
01:22:16,099 --> 01:22:19,137
[The ultimate winner of Legend of the Sword,
Ace Ji Hyo!]

1379
01:22:20,297 --> 01:22:22,726
Where did Lee Kwang Soo the ghost go?

1380
01:22:22,727 --> 01:22:27,714
[This is... where the golden turtle
lies await in slumber.]

1381
01:22:31,795 --> 01:22:34,449
- Thank you. Thanks for all the hard work.
- Hye Jin, did you win?

1382
01:22:36,903 --> 01:22:38,411
- So Ji Hyo won?
- Ji Hyo won?

1383
01:22:39,497 --> 01:22:44,004
[The final owner of the golden sword-
Ace Ji Hyo makes her appearance!]

1384
01:22:44,005 --> 01:22:46,485
- Whenever we go overseas, she wins.
- As soon as the gold come back...

1385
01:22:46,486 --> 01:22:49,233
- Gold was the prize?
- As soon as the gold came back, she wins.

1386
01:22:49,551 --> 01:22:51,027
So gold was the prize?

1387
01:22:51,028 --> 01:22:52,475
The gold has been resurrected!

1388
01:22:54,380 --> 01:22:58,745
[As she pulls the half of the golden sword
out in front of the golden turtle...]

1389
01:23:03,163 --> 01:23:07,267
[It transforms it's shape
into a complete golden sword!]

1390
01:23:07,771 --> 01:23:09,175
<i>It's a perfected sword.</i>

1391
01:23:10,444 --> 01:23:12,492
It used to be only half the sword...

1392
01:23:13,830 --> 01:23:17,380
Hey... I should've been the winner.
It should've been me.

1393
01:23:17,381 --> 01:23:18,964
Shouldn't the sword be returned
to the turtle now?

1394
01:23:18,965 --> 01:23:21,723
- Yes, it should be returned.
- My golden sword...

1395
01:23:21,724 --> 01:23:24,884
I will return it to the turtle,
and restore peace upon the world.

1396
01:23:28,600 --> 01:23:29,835
Congratulations.

1397
01:23:38,786 --> 01:23:42,222
[This is the start of the legend...]

1398
01:23:42,222 --> 01:23:43,936
[The legend has it that once the
sword was returned...

1399
01:23:43,936 --> 01:23:46,330
the turtle disappeared
into the depths of the water.]

1400
01:23:48,200 --> 01:23:52,971
[And the ultimate sword that
brought out the greed in people...]

1401
01:23:52,971 --> 01:23:57,255
[Was broken down into nine daggers that
divided up the ultimate power...]

1402
01:23:57,255 --> 01:24:03,755
[and was scattered throughout
the land of Asia.]

1403
01:24:11,217 --> 01:24:14,791
[And several centuries later...]

1404
01:24:14,791 --> 01:24:19,191
[Running Man's Asia race will start
to find 'The secrets of the nine daggers.']

1405
01:24:21,663 --> 01:24:24,578
[Without knowing the secret
that is centuries old...]

1406
01:24:24,578 --> 01:24:28,724
[The nine members of Running Man set out
on an adventure to find the daggers.]

1407
01:24:30,872 --> 01:24:34,876
[Unraveling the secret of the golden turtle,
which has guarded the secret for ages...]

1408
01:24:34,876 --> 01:24:37,360
[And the golden sword ultimately
is brought back to humanity.]
