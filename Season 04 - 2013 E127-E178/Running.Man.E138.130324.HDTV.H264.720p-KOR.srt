you have for your inner desire to act</i>

36

<i>Okay?</i>

38
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:05,170
- Well...
- That's how it is.

39
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:06,740
What do you mean, that's how it is?

40
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:11,440

is a very sensitive issue...

41
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,980

[The right way to greet someone on this
show is to rip off their name tag.]

46
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:42,240
Why would you rip off my name tag
the moment we see each other again?

47
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,400
This really does feel good though.

48

as soon as I saw this.

I forgot Jong Hyun was on

79
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:43,810

- Your first mission of the day is...
- What is it?

105
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,570
We're not doing it with the other members?

106
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:10,370
[Athletic Team members still don't know
who the members of the other team are.]

107
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,890

with name tag elimination.</i>

114
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:31,580

- So we have to pick two people right now?

115
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:36,470

116
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:41,790
[Whenever a person is eliminated, another
member from that club will enter to replace.]

117
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:44,290
No matter what the case is...
I guess we're going to lose.

118
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:47,340
We can't beat Jong Kook!

119
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,770
He hates hearing that the most!

120
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:51,970
[A phrase the game adversary
hates hearing the most!]

121
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,530
I'm sorry.

122
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,670
You have to be more positive
when living your life.

123
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:01,380
Soo Ro hates hearing
things like that the most.

124
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:03,990
So we should start by choosing
two people first, right?

125
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:05,880
This is your third time on Running Man,
isn't it, Jong Hyun?

126
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:09,040
- Yes, this is my third time on the show.
- You've played this game before, right?

127
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,840
Yes, I've played it every time
I've been on the show.

128
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,610
I haven't exactly done very well.

129
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:17,920
[Having been eliminated by Mr. Capable
every single time he's played it.]

130
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:18,980
Jong Hyun told you himself.

131
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,860
He just laughs the whole time
and then goes home.

132
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:25,020
<i>Since we don't know who's on the
other team, we should be very careful...</i>

133
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:30,080
[Must be cautious about their plans since
they don't know who their opponents are.]

134
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:34,210
- Kwang Soo's not a weak player.
- Kwang Soo can be a strong player.

135
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:36,100
Not a single one of us here...

136
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:38,190
would be lacking against anyone.

137
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:41,390
Not a single one of us would
fall behind anyone we encounter.

138
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:44,290
I can win against anyone when it
comes to the name tag elimination game.

139
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:49,230
We have to start by taking the upper hand
for us to last to the end.

140
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:52,210
Woo Bin and Jong Suk...
and Hyo Rin and Jong Hyun...

141
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:53,590
- Let's get this done today.
- Of course.

142
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,700
Where do we need to go?

143
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:56,920
What's that?

144
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,410
[Ones chosen must enter the battlefield
with their eyes blindfolded.]

145
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:09,630
This is scary.

146
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:13,900
[The first ones to enter the field,
Kim Woo Bin and Lee Jong Hyun!]

147
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,030
Watch out for the steps.

148
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:17,710

what we're made of.</i>

The Easy Brothers!]

150

second floor of the basement.

151
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:25,830
I'll get out first.
I'll get out here.

152
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:27,720
- I'll see you later.
- Okay, see you later.

153
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,090
This is scary.

154
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:32,010
- Only Kwang Soo is going to get out here.
- What?

155
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:33,380
We're getting out separately?

156
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,190
We're not getting off together?

157
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:36,770
Why aren't we getting off together?

158
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:42,280
[Theater Department vs. Athletic Department.]

159
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:45,890

one another in a name tag elimination game.</i>

163
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:02,490
<i>We will have a name tag
elimination game.</i>

164
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:03,660
Yes!

165
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:10,130
<i>At this moment... you will all take off your
blindfolds and enter the arena simultaneously.</i>

166
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:14,240
<i>Club face-off name tag elimination...</i>

167
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:16,390
<i>Start!</i>

168
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:22,260
[Even the members lying in wait
are feeling the nervous energy.]

169
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:25,050
- I wish there was a live broadcast.
- Live broadcast would be nice.

170
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:30,530
[Theater Department vs. Athletic Department.
The real face-off starts now!]

171
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:32,840
During last year's enrollment...

172
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:35,370
I really wanted to be admitted
into the acting department.

173
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:37,100
But the acting department...

174
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,950
did not accept me.

175
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:45,120
[Giraffe wasn't accepted into the department
two years ago because of his looks.]

176
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,110
[On the other hand...]

177
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:54,220
[Woo Bin and Jong Hyun meeting up
to form a strategy.]

178
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:56,720
Hey... I think I just saw Suk Jin.

179
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:01,420
[Theater Department aggressively
seeking out their opponents.]

180
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:06,180
I found him!

181
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:07,610
- Come help me.
- Who is that?

182
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:10,080
[Athletic Club's Kwang Soo vs.
Woo Bin and Jong Hyun of the Theater Club.]

183
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,080
[Attacks as soon as he sees him!]

184
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:15,420
<i>Suk Jin!</i>

185
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,270
Suk Jin!

186
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:20,150
- What is it?
- Suk Jin!

187
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:24,080
Who are they?
Where are they?

188
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,500
There are two out there.

189
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,180
- Hello.
- Who is it?

190
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:29,860
[Starting off with a happy greeting.]

191
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:35,000
[Woo Bin sneaks up from behind while
Jong Hyun distracts them with his greeting.]

192
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,490
[A full-on battle right from the start!]

193
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:42,150
[Greetings are over!
Jong Hyun and Impala facing off!]

194
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:44,590
- You're going to use your strength on me?
- Get down from there!

195
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:50,430
[His ambush is a success!
Woo Bin now sneaking up on Impala!]

196
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:51,600
Kwang Soo!

197
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,450
Shall we just battle it out?
Like men?

198
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:58,010
Kwang Soo... let's switch spots.

199
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,420
- Why are you asking me to do that?
- You take Woo Bin!

200
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:03,620
- Let's not be like this amongst ourselves!
- You take Woo Bin!

201
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:05,830
But I've already called dibs on Jong Hyun!

202
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:08,480
No, I called dibs on him first.
I called dibs from the moment I saw him.

203
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:09,690
Hurry!

204
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:13,000
[Imminent face-off]

205
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:18,150
[An endless play of attack and defense
like a fierce judo competition.]

206
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,970
- Suk Jin...
- What?

207
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:23,020
Even just the fact that we haven't
run away from these two yet is very...

208
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:24,480
- Of course!
- That's a great feat in itself.

209
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:27,370
Jong Hyun... go over to Kwang Soo.

210
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,060
Go over to Kwang Soo.

211
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:30,990
[What? He's telling him
to attack Kwang Soo?]

212
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:32,170
Suk Jin, what are you doing?

213
00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:36,250
Why are you sending him over to me?

214
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:39,500
[This is what you call loyalty
between the Easy Brothers.]

215
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,300
- I was just trying to help you out.
- What?

216
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:44,410
Suk Jin... how could you do that to me?

217
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:52,120
[Giraffe makes his escape!]

218
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:54,870
[Easy Brothers' relay of betrayal!]

219
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:57,160
[It's Big-nosed Brother who's
in danger this time!]

220
00:11:58,460 --> 00:11:59,960
Okay, I'll help you eliminate Kwang Soo.

221
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:03,180
Lee Kwang Soo!

222
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:07,560
[When it comes to betrayals,
Giraffe has one up on you...]

223
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,000
That Lee Kwang Soo!

224
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:14,370
[The moment Impala is left alone,
he is easily ousted!]

225
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:21,430
<i>[Recruiting a member of Athletic Club.]</i>

226
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:23,520
- Does this mean one of them is dead?
- Exactly.

227
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:26,390
Jong Hyuk and Woo Bin are out there
doing a great job.

228
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:27,970
I wondered who was eliminated?

229
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:29,860
I wonder which one of our opponent's
was ousted?

230
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,500
<i>Recruiting a member of Athletic Club.</i>

231
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,230
I knew this was going to happen.

232
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:37,840
Jong Kook.

233
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:43,670
[Is it time for me to step in?]

234
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:46,630
Let's go.

235
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:50,730
[Mr. Capable of the Athletic Club
entering the arena.]

236
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:52,180
- Watch your back.
- We have to win this.

237
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:54,820
We have to win this. You know that, right?
We have to win this!

238
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:56,420
Okay... we have to win
no matter what.

239
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:58,670
- It was Suk Jin, wasn't it?
- I'm sure it was.

240
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:01,810
[In that case...]

241
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:03,870
[Race, start!]

242
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,810
[Mr. Capable is on the chase!]

243
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:14,870
We have to keep going like this.
Since those guys are older than us...

244
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:18,160
When they get exhausted,
they'll just give up.

245
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:20,980
- With our youth...
- With our youth?

246
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:22,480
We're going to win this
with our youth.

247
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,500
- Should we take this to the end?
- Of course.

248
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,220
- Until Jong Kook comes out?
- Let's make sure your name is on tight.

249
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,320
[Mr. Capable with his blindfold
still covering his eyes.]

250
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:41,310
[Huh? Giraffe is going to guide
Mr. Capable in himself?]

251
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:48,770
What the heck is that?

252
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:50,770
You should've told me that
was in my way.

253
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:55,560
[Petty vengeful acts towards the Tiger.]

254
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,480
What are you doing?

255
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:01,490
[The clueless Tiger is bumping into
everything in the room.]

256
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:06,080
[Giraffe... what are you thinking?]

257
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:08,470
<i>Athletic Club replacement member
completes his entrance.</i>

258
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:09,900
<i>You can take off the blindfold now.</i>

259
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:13,830
Jong Kook!

260
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:18,250
[Immediately gets chastised.]

261
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,700
- What the heck is going on out here?
- Jong Kook...

262
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:24,280
It's Kim Woo Bin and Jong Hyun
on the show.

263
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,450
Ah, Jong Hyun...

264
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:29,610
But all Suk Jin did was just sit back to watch
what's going on without doing anything.

265
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:32,410
- It looks like you've been through a battle.
- It was no joke.

266
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:34,660
So I just... left Suk Jin behind
and escaped.

267
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:38,090
- What is the matter with you?
- I had no other choice.

268
00:14:38,090 --> 00:14:39,830
- What do you mean, you had no choice?
- They were both coming at me.

269
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:44,890
[Mr. Capable is now fully apprised
of what's going on.]

270
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:49,970
[Okay... in that case...]

271
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:56,100
[These two are still unaware of who the
replacement is from the Athletic Club.]

272
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,330
<i>Ji Hyo!</i>

273
00:14:57,930 --> 00:14:59,230
<i>Ji Hyo!</i>

274
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:01,230
<i>Ji Hyo!</i>

275
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,690
<i>Ji Hyo, come here!
Over here!</i>

276
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:07,510
Ji Hyo!

277
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:10,910
[The strategy is to pretend Ji Hyo is
the replacement by calling out her name!]

278
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:15,060
[A plan to lure them out for
Mr. Capable to attack them in an ambush!]

279
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:17,800
<i>- Ji Hyo!
- Hey...</i>

280
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:20,040
Kwang Soo's alone right now.
Let's go now and eliminate him.

281
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:23,480
Ji Hyo!

282
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,960
Ji Hyo, over here!
Ji Hyo!

283
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:26,450
They're right here!

284
00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:29,830
[Okay... nice.]

285
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:30,930
Ji Hyo!

286
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:34,850
[Woo Bin and Jong Hyun chasing down
Kwang Soo without any suspicion.]

287
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:38,030
Ji Hyo!

288
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:40,040
Come here.

289
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,520
[Discovers Mr. Capable!]

290
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,590
[An immediate retreat!]

291
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:47,250
[Mr. Capable is on the move!]

292
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:50,110
Kwang Soo, you're so obvious!

293
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:55,250
[Mr. Capable's appearance immediately
turns the tables around.]

294
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:04,730
What if Kim Jong Kook is out there
as soon as we enter the game?

295
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:08,940
[His curiosity is too busy hunting down
his own teammates at the moment.]

296
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,700
Let's get this over with quickly.

297
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:14,360
[The four men caught in a face-off
in a dead end hallway.]

298
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:18,030
[No more room to run!]

299
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:24,980
[Extreme nervous energy!]

300
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:27,020
[One second of hesitation can mean defeat!]

301
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:28,600
This finally feels like a race!

302
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:35,940
[Woo Bin and Jong Hyun of
the Theater Club are cornered!]

303
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:44,150
[A fierce physical battle!]

304
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:52,820
Get him!

305
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:59,460
[Both... at the same time!]

306
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:04,200
[Kwang Soo beats him to it
by a split of a second!]

307
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:07,940
[Kim Woo Bin, Out!]

308
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:12,000
[Mr. Capable and the Giraffe vs.
Judo athlete Jong Hyun.]

309
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:17,130
[Jong Hyun breaking out his judo moves.]

310
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,460
What the heck is this?
Come on, what is this?

311
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:32,920
[Jong Hyun sticks it out for a while,
but unfortunately is ousted in the end.]

312
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:37,950
<i>[Recruiting a member of
the Theater Club.]</i>

313
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:40,300
<i>Recruiting a member of
the Theater Club.</i>

314
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:45,450
[Next member to go in, Jong Suk.]

315
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:48,750
- Fighting.
- Your hand... your hand is really cold.

316
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:52,700
I wonder if it was Jong Hyun
who got ousted?

317
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,430
[Another announcement?]

318
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:57,190
<i>Recruiting a member of
the Theater Club.</i>

319
00:17:57,190 --> 00:17:59,280
It's another recruitment call?

320
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:03,000
[With Woo Bin and Jong Hyun's elimination,
two members of the Theater Club are called.]

321
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,470
- Hyo Rin.
- You want me to go in now?

322
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:08,020
[The sole female member of the club,
Hyo Rin also goes in as replacement.]

323
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:09,230
Yes.

324
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:13,870
We're in big trouble.
I'm positive Kim Jong Kook is out there.

325
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:16,740
Kim Jong Kook really is something else.

326
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,540
<i>Suk Jin!</i>

327
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:21,300
[Theater Club's Jong Suk and Hyo Rin vs.
Athletic Club's Jong Kook and Kwang Soo.]

328
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,990
Suk Jin!

329
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,260
[Kwang Soo... lure them over to me.]

330
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:35,010
[Giraffe actively luring them in.]

331
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:39,880
Where is Jong Kook?

332
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:47,820
[Opposite to his plan, Jong Suk is
the one who attacks Kwang Soo!]

333
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:49,360
Wait... wait!

334
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:53,290
[He's about to get ousted right now,
let alone lure anyone in!]

335
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:57,850
[Mr. Capable runs over
after hearing all the commotion.]

336
00:18:57,850 --> 00:19:00,740
[Total chaos!]

337
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:02,250
No!

338
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:09,430
Jong Kook!
Where have you been?

339
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:14,460
- Why are you already here?
- I've been watching this whole time.

340
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:16,910
Don't even move an inch
away from me.

341
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:19,280
Is Jae Suk waiting to come out last?

342
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:22,770
[Jong Suk and Hyo Rin run to safety
after having seen Mr. Capable.]

343
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:25,450
What a nice picture to see a boy and a girl
running away together like that.

344
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,890
You guys make a nice picture!

345
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:31,320
[Oh my goodness... while holding hands?]

346
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:37,240
[Is this the birth of a new school couple?]

347
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:44,330
[As if a scene right out of
a high school drama!]

348
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:49,310
- Jong Kook, let's hold hands too!
- What?

349
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:50,770
Why would I hold your hand?

350
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:52,320
- Let's hold hands like they did.
- Why?

351
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,030
- Let's hold hands like they did.
- Let go of me right now!

352
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:01,340
You hide right here,
and I'll go hide over there, okay?

353
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:05,060
I didn't take this seriously enough.

354
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:07,490
And here I thought I was a good runner.

355
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:09,200
[The challenge of Running Man's chase that
has to be experienced to be believed.]

356
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,220
You two...

357
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:12,700
Come up to the rooftop after class.

358
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,390
[What's he saying?]

359
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:18,530
- He's just trying to lure us right now.
- Come up to the rooftop.

360
00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:19,820
No...

361
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:23,780
[Since they keep escaping no matter what,
must try to lure them back in somehow.]

362
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:25,820
No!
We're not going to follow you.

363
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:28,830
I've never seen you been so adamant like this
when I watched the show on TV before.

364
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:29,900
No kidding.

365
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:33,800
[Giraffe feeling overly confident
with Mr. Capable covering his back.]

366
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:35,960
Let's go.

367
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,300
[There they go!]

368
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:40,900
No, no, no...

369
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:43,820
[Hyo Rin stepping up to
save her teammate.]

370
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:45,280
Wait!

371
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:49,210
[Giraffe becoming extremely flustered at
the joint attack by the theater couple.]

372
00:20:50,010 --> 00:20:52,470
Jong Kook!

373
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:56,350
[Calling out Mr. Capable's name
over and over...]

374
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:58,940
Jong Kook!

375
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:05,920
[Lee Kwang Soo, Out!]

376
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:11,310
[What's taking him so long?]

377
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:12,710
Jong Kook!

378
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:16,150
[The next recruitment Haroro starts searching
for Jong Kook the moment he's in the game.]

379
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:18,470
[But something feels...]

380
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:25,870
[Discovers reflection of Jong Suk and Hyo Rin
waiting in ambush-mode in the mirror!]

381
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:27,720
[Running away is key!]

382
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:35,490
There's nowhere for me to escape to!

383
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:36,810
Hello!

384
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:42,310
[Theater couple's plan is to oust Ha Ha
before he can meet up with Mr. Capable.]

385
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:45,480
[Haroro is in danger of becoming
ousted the moment he steps into the game!]

386
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:47,360
Wait... this guy...

387
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,060
- Hello.
- It's nice to meet you.

388
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:51,190
[It's nice to meet each other, but let's
save the formal greeting until later.]

389
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:56,000
[Easily caught due to his short strides.]

390
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:04,440
[The theater couple not being
shy about becoming aggressive.]

391
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:06,730
Jong Kook!

392
00:22:07,650 --> 00:22:11,300
[Commonality of all the weaklings:
When in danger, call out Mr. Capable's name.]

393
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:16,850
[Haroro is ousted less than a minute
after entering the game!]

394
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:18,400
Where is my teammate?

395
00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:22,850
Bye!

396
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:28,990
[Complete exhaustion.]

397
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:35,340
<i>Recruiting a member of the
Athletic Club.</i>

398
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:38,390
- It's the Athletic Club again!
- Wow!

399
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:40,460
Jong Suk and Hyo Rin are
a lethal team!

400
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:41,910
How can this be?

401
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:44,380
- Recruiting a member of the Athletic Club.
- Again?

402
00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:46,800
- Recruiting a member of the Athletic Club.
- Again?

403
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:49,120
How did this happen?
He got ousted the moment he went out?

404
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,530
Ji Hyo...

405
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:53,560
- I'm going out there. I'll see you later.
- Okay.

406
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,990
She's not even fully awake yet...

407
00:22:59,870 --> 00:23:02,330
Okay, here's what's going on.
Min Hyo Rin and...

408
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,690
[Now that we take a look at this...]

409
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:09,850
[It's the ultimate combination,
Mr. Capable and Ace!]

410
00:23:09,850 --> 00:23:11,060
Where did he get ousted?

411
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:12,410
I think right over there.

412
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:14,550
There they are.
They're down there.

413
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:17,000
- They're down there.
- What do we do?

414
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:20,650
They just saw us.

415
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:26,440
- We just have to face them.
- Facing them is the only thing we can do.

416
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:27,970
Should we go down there?

417
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:33,100
They're coming down.
They're coming down right now.

418
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:39,090
Then I'll... I'll grab Kim Jong Kook,
so you try ripping off his name tag.

419
00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:40,330
But I...

420
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:43,180
- I'm pretty much out of energy right now.
- They're down here now.

421
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:48,260
[The two male and females teams
finally coming to face one another.]

422
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:52,440
[The theater couple is automatically
starting to backtrack.]

423
00:23:53,050 --> 00:23:54,430
- Hello.
- Jong Suk...

424
00:23:54,430 --> 00:23:56,370
- Wait... Wait, Jong Kook.
- Jong Suk.

425
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:02,140
- Ji Hyo, I'm a huge fan of yours.
- Yes, I'm a fan of yours as well.

426
00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:04,470
- Thank you.
- While watching you earlier...

427
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:08,720
[Mr. Capable and Ace target
Jong Suk first!]

428
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:16,120
[Hyo Rin barely manages to pull
Ji Hyo away...]

429
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:18,070
Jong Kook, how about you
come here first?

430
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:19,630
No, don't listen to her!

431
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:22,310
She's so tiny that
I don't know what to do with her.

432
00:24:24,370 --> 00:24:26,440
- Ji Hyo...
- Look at how she's getting pulled!

433
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:32,120
- Hyo Rin.
- Why are you dragging her around?

434
00:24:33,790 --> 00:24:34,810
What do I do?

435
00:24:34,810 --> 00:24:39,490
[Jong Suk is also being shoved around
by Mr. Capable.]

436
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:47,070
[The ultimate defense!
Lay down on their backs.]

437
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:50,660
<i>What are we being
reduced to doing right now?</i>

438
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:54,550
I'm sorry!

439
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:57,680
[Lee Jong Suk, Out!]

440
00:24:58,470 --> 00:25:00,060
I don't know what to do with her.

441
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:05,850
[Easily ousted the moment she
flips herself around.]

442
00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:09,220
[This is the dangerous power of
Mr. Capable and Ace!]

443
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,820
I really didn't know what to do
with you because you're so tiny.

444
00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:15,430
- I'm sorry, but you worked hard.
- Good work.

445
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:23,760
<i>Theater club...
recruiting two members.</i>

446
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:26,990
<i>Recruiting two members of
the theater club.</i>

447
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:32,040
- Now that it's come down to this...
- Soo Ro...

448
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,540
Let's finish this right now.

449
00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:38,560
[The last two members of the
Theater Club finally entering the game.]

450
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:46,310
[Ousted members of the club
all await in the van.]

451
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:48,360
- That's some serious stuff.
- It's no joke, is it?

452
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:50,840
- Who did you get ousted by?
- I'm so exhausted.

453
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,340
This is really exhausting.

454
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:54,090
To be perfectly honest,
I didn't know it would be this difficult.

455
00:25:54,090 --> 00:25:58,890
I didn't know they ran so hard like
they do when I watched them on TV.

456
00:25:59,210 --> 00:26:00,900
All those guys are all pretty strong.

457
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:05,220
- Ha Ha was no joke, was he?
- Seriously.

458
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:06,790
Ha Ha was really fast.

459
00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:09,620
They're all so fast.

460
00:26:13,770 --> 00:26:17,060
[The final two members of the Theater Club,
Soo Ro and Jae Suk, enter the game.]

461
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:21,100
[Behind the enemy lines adversary,
and the grasshopper.]

462
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:23,890
[The honor of the Theater Club
rests on their shoulders.]

463
00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:29,910
There's Jae Suk.

464
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:35,960
- Look at them... Song Ji Hyo too.
- Come over here.

465
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:39,920
- I said, come out here!
- You come over here!

466
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:44,140
[Battle of wills. Telling each
other to come over to them.]

467
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:45,510
Come outside!

468
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:47,620
[Soo Ro is lying in wait to
ambush them.]

469
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:49,590
Song Ji Hyo!
What are you doing right now?

470
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:51,160
I'm a member of the Athletic Club!

471
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:54,340
- Don't you see the pants that I'm wearing?
- Come out here!

472
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:55,990
Do you not see the leggings
that I'm wearing right now?

473
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:57,390
- Come out!
- Come out here.

474
00:26:58,150 --> 00:27:01,690
What? Are you scared? Are you
scared after seeing the pants I'm wearing?

475
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,420
- You seem scared!
- What are you going to do about it?

476
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:05,540
What are you going to do
by wearing those stretchy pants?

477
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:07,080
<i>Just come out here!</i>

478
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:09,360
Jae Suk... why are you
out here alone?

479
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,830
Our Theater Club just worked
out that way.

480
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:11,980
- Why?
- How come?

481
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:13,590
It's personal family business!

482
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:17,590
- Why? What's wrong with your family?
- We've had some things come up at home.

483
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:18,800
- Family issues?
- Yeah!

484
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:22,480
- Hurry up and get over here.
- You come here!

485
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,910
- Who else do you have with you?
- You guys come over here.

486
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:25,910
- Who's the other person?
- Who else do you have with you?

487
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:27,500
- Who is it?
- You guys come over here!

488
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:33,050
[Strange feeling... It seems
Jae Suk is trying to lure them in.]

489
00:27:34,150 --> 00:27:39,010
[Jae Suk's plan is to lure them in
to where Soo Ro is waiting for them.]

490
00:27:39,010 --> 00:27:41,420
<i>Something doesn't feel right.
I feel like you're trying to lure us in.</i>

491
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:45,060
<i>Who's the other person?</i>

492
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:49,430
I'm getting... a really strong
and weird vibe right now.

493
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:50,440
- Right?
- Yeah.

494
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,820
It's a really strong vibe.

495
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:54,600
Let's get Jong Kook first.

496
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:59,380
Come over here.
I can see you over there.

497
00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:01,900
I can see your eyes over there.

498
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:03,130
I know!

499
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:05,940
- I'm standing here for you to see!
- Who are you with?

500
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:07,400
<i>I said, I'm standing here
for you to see!</i>

501
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:15,220
[At last!]

502
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:20,560
[Life-long rivals, Soo Ro and Jong Kook
come face to face!]

503
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:22,950
- Hi, Ji Hyo!
- Hello!

504
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:26,690
[During the days of 'Family Outing',
these two used to be as close as brothers.]

505
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:32,560
[Even their greeting is full of nervous energy
from being aware of each other's strengths.]

506
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:35,430
- What brings you on today, Soo Ro?
- It's been awhile!

507
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:38,480
- What are you doing here?
- Jong Kook, it's Soo Ro!

508
00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:42,060
I was wondering who else
was on the show today.

509
00:28:44,370 --> 00:28:45,550
Soo Ro!

510
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:51,710
[Want to greet each other with a hug,
but the opponent's back is too tempting.]

511
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:53,100
It's starting already.

512
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:54,540
How about a hug, Ji Hyo?

513
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:57,360
- Soo Ro...
- Let's just settle for a handshake.

514
00:28:57,470 --> 00:28:59,300
That's right!

515
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,890
[A hidden sword behind his greeting!]

516
00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:06,050
Why is your handshake so cold?

517
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:08,150
No breaks because you're a girl.

518
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:10,840
[Staying alert and vigilant
while facing off one another.]

519
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:15,310
[Full of nervous energy]

520
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:20,470
[The position is slowly...]

521
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:24,880
[Soo Ro and Jae Suk somehow get
Mr. Capable and Ace cornered.]

522
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:28,090
[Mr. Capable and Ace in danger!]

523
00:29:32,630 --> 00:29:34,450
[Has Jae Suk in a tight grip!]

524
00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:41,070
[Just then,
Mr. Capable starts his attack too!]

525
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:43,350
[And Soo Ro immediately counterattacks!]

526
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:55,240
[Simultaneously grabs each other's name tag!
Who will be faster to eliminate?]

527
00:29:56,860 --> 00:30:00,490
[Soo Ro... was faster!]

528
00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:03,380
[Happened in the blink of an eye!]

529
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:07,240
[How can this be?]

530
00:30:08,510 --> 00:30:10,300
[Mr. Capable, Out!]

531
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:11,520
I can't believe that happened.

532
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:14,240
[This is the power of the Game Adversary.]

533
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:18,580
[The final member of the Athletic Club,
Gary enters the game!]

534
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:21,540
- Gary, what are we going to do?
- Jong Kook got ousted?

535
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:23,620
- Do you know who it is?
- Who is it?

536
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:25,140
- It's Kim Soo Ro!
- Seriously?

537
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:27,550
What are we going to do?
We're in big trouble.

538
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,530
- Who else is left besides Soo Ro?
- Jae Suk.

539
00:30:29,530 --> 00:30:30,630
Jae Suk!

540
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:34,200
What are we going to do?
Those two are really strong.

541
00:30:34,610 --> 00:30:36,150
We're in trouble.
What are we going to do?

542
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:41,140
[Will the Monday Couple be able to
recoup their position?]

543
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:44,720
- Should we go that way?
- There you are. Come here, Gary.

544
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,970
Hello, Soo Ro.
Have you been well?

545
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:50,000
- Hey, Gary!
- Gary, we should at least shake hands.

546
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,980
- Yes, Soo Ro.
- You two are left now?

547
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:54,370
We don't shake hands on Running Man!

548
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:57,280
Shaking hands could be
dangerous on our show.

549
00:30:58,570 --> 00:31:00,660
- You stay right there!
- Wait... wait!

550
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:02,150
Wait, Soo Ro!

551
00:31:03,810 --> 00:31:06,580
[Total fear]

552
00:31:08,330 --> 00:31:10,670
Don't you think that this is
too unevenly matched?

553
00:31:10,670 --> 00:31:12,430
That's how we felt when Jong Kook was
still in the game.

554
00:31:12,430 --> 00:31:14,970
- Soo Ro...
- It was the same for us with Jong Kook.

555
00:31:14,970 --> 00:31:17,210
[Theater Club cornering them
into a dead end hallway.]

556
00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:19,010
What's with that glint in
your eye, Soo Ro?

557
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:22,830
Soo Ro...

558
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:25,880
- He says he's going to end it now.
- What is it that you keep trying to end?

559
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:29,710
[Men of the Theater Club attacking
regardless of Ji Hyo being a girl.]

560
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:33,240
Gary...

561
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:35,820
[Gary's shocking counterattack!]

562
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:38,740
- Gary...
- You're kicking us now?

563
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:43,540
[At this rate,
the Monday Couple is going to be...]

564
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:49,390
[Oh?]

565
00:31:49,390 --> 00:31:52,600
[Blank Ji takes the moment of opportunity
amidst the chaos to grab Soo Ro's name tag!]

566
00:31:57,170 --> 00:31:59,250
[My goodness!]

567
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:02,430
[Kim Soo Ro, Out!]

568
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:09,210
[Blank Ji does something even Mr. Capable
couldn't do and ousts Soo Ro!]

569
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:13,820
[ Theater Club's Jae Suk now left
all on his own!]

570
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:16,810
[Monday Couple promptly moves in
on the Grasshopper!]

571
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:19,760
- It's your turn now!
- Gary!

572
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:23,070
I can't believe this is happening to me!

573
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:25,600
- How can this be happening?
- Ji Hyo...

574
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,280
Ji Hyo, here it is!
Get it, Ji Hyo!

575
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:29,150
[Jae Suk's counterattack!]

576
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:34,100
[Do not underestimate Jae Suk's strength!]

577
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:35,520
Hurry up and rip it off, Ji Hyo!

578
00:32:36,210 --> 00:32:37,800
Gary, I can't get it!

579
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:45,710
[Gary, Out!]

580
00:32:46,810 --> 00:32:50,390
[Club competition's ultimate face-off,
Blank Ji vs. Jae Suk!]

581
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,700
- Ji Hyo, how can you do this to me?
- Ji Hyo! Pinch him!

582
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,540
- Stop tickling me!
- You can't do that!

583
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:57,910
You have to win!
Don't let her win!

584
00:33:03,670 --> 00:33:07,780
[Song Ji Hyo wins!]

585
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:13,760
Ji Hyo, you're really something else.

586
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,370
That was a given.

587
00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:28,300
[Club competition, winner of
name tag elimination: Athletic Club]

588
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:29,490
Ji Hyo ousted them both.

589
00:33:29,490 --> 00:33:33,200
[Blank Ji having ousted both
Jae Suk and Soo Ro's name tags!]

590
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,840
Song Ji Hyo, you've still got it!

591
00:33:37,910 --> 00:33:39,530
<i>Since you've earned the flag,
make sure to keep it very safe.</i>

592
00:33:39,530 --> 00:33:41,680
<i>And you may board the car
and move on to our next location.</i>

593
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:44,420
- Great job!
- Our Athletic Club is the best!

594
00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:49,040
[What did the three of you do?]

595
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:54,550
- We have to win the next game.
- Of course, that's a given.

596
00:33:55,290 --> 00:33:57,330
- Theater Club, fighting!
- Fighting!

597
00:33:57,330 --> 00:34:00,810
I've just become an enemy of
that other club right now.

598
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:03,490
I've been marked by the Athletic Club.

599
00:34:05,030 --> 00:34:08,580
We're going to head over to the
sports park in Song-do!

600
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:10,540
- Okay!
- Let's go!

601
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:14,110
- Athletic Club!
- Athletic Club.

602
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:18,820
<i>You still got it, Athletic Club!</i>

603
00:34:20,090 --> 00:34:22,350
Don't go anywhere else!

604
00:34:22,350 --> 00:34:24,060
That's a good line.

605
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:25,950
- Are they here?
- Open the door.

606
00:34:25,950 --> 00:34:27,540
Why don't we sing the song?

607
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:31,440
[Provocation]

608
00:34:37,090 --> 00:34:38,930
You guys better watch yourselves!

609
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:44,820
<i>Theater Club has lost it!</i>

610
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:53,450
- That's weak!
- Let's see who's talking after this!

611
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:57,360
That's so disappointing.
We should've taken the flag.

612
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:00,040
What do you think of today, Woo Bin?

613
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:03,450
What did you think of the first round?
What did you think of your plays?

614
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:06,170
We had no plays.

615
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:09,360
- We just went around together.
- Really?

616
00:35:09,370 --> 00:35:12,360
Jong Suk looks a lot like I did
when I was younger.

617
00:35:13,330 --> 00:35:14,420
- Really?
- Yeah.

618
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:17,040
[Do I?]

619
00:35:17,910 --> 00:35:19,000
- Jae Suk.
- Yes?

620
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,430
I've seen you around when
you were younger.

621
00:35:21,430 --> 00:35:25,270
[There's a witness.
Who does he think he's trying to fool?]

622
00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:27,350
Then how young are we
talking about here?

623
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:31,730
[Arriving at the mission location.]

624
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:32,990
Shall we get out of the car?

625
00:35:32,990 --> 00:35:35,710
[We're going to win this time.
Theater Club, fighting!]

626
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:37,260
<i>I feel like we've been here before.</i>

627
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:39,980
What's this?

628
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:43,750
- This is a store.
- Let's buy something to eat.

629
00:35:46,190 --> 00:35:48,050
- I'm hungry.
- We need to eat something.

630
00:35:48,050 --> 00:35:50,590
- What are they selling here?
- Are you selling any cup ramen?

631
00:35:50,590 --> 00:35:51,760
<i>Hello!</i>

632
00:35:52,570 --> 00:35:54,680
<i>- Wow, that looks good.
- There are a lot of goodies here.</i>

633
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:57,330
<i>I like this fried udon soup.</i>

634
00:35:57,330 --> 00:35:58,780
I'll take a roll of kimbap.

635
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:00,550
[An enjoyable snack time.]

636
00:36:00,990 --> 00:36:02,780
- What is this? What are they eating?
- It's a store.

637
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:06,420
- Soo Ro!
- Jong Kook!

638
00:36:06,730 --> 00:36:09,440
[The two competitors finally greeting
each other the proper way.]

639
00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:13,440
[Theater Captain, Soo Ro
overflowing with masculine strength.]

640
00:36:15,910 --> 00:36:17,000
[What's the mission?]

641
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,880
<i>[Each club write down the name of
three games that they feel confident in.]</i>

642
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:22,910
<i>[And choose two of those three games,
and win two out of three rounds.]</i>

643
00:36:23,570 --> 00:36:28,060
However, the loser team must pay for
the total cost of the winning team's snacks.

644
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:30,150
<i>We're going to win this
no matter what.</i>

645
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:34,450
- Since you guys are going to pay...
- What is it that you keep eating?

646
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,920
<i>Let's all eat as much as we can!</i>

647
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,680
I've already ordered a ton of food.

648
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:48,060
[Pure happiness as if they're back
in school visiting the school snack shop.]

649
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:51,010
It feels good to see
all my old classmates like this.

650
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:52,830
Classmates?

651
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:54,890
Are you ripping on me right now?

652
00:36:54,890 --> 00:36:58,240
- You look more like their teacher!
- Can't you tell I'm Class of 2013?

653
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:01,110
Just look at the way you look.
I bet you were the ugliest in your class!

654
00:37:01,110 --> 00:37:04,360
- What did you say?
- Your face looks like a miniature squid!

655
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:06,080
You're totally a sight.

656
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:09,050
Should we play a dunk shoot game
for our pick?

657
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:12,960
[With total faith in his tall classmates,
antagonizing Ha Ha to his heart's content.]

658
00:37:13,810 --> 00:37:15,930
- We've got Kwang Soo over here.
- Kwang Soo.

659
00:37:16,050 --> 00:37:17,810
We're not scared of you guys!

660
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:22,610
Since Woo Bin and Jong Suk
are really tall...

661
00:37:22,610 --> 00:37:24,320
are there any games where we can
utilize their height?

662
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,460
- How about a relay?
- That's right.

663
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:28,050
How about doing the splits to connect
the legs to see who can get the most length?

664
00:37:28,110 --> 00:37:31,310
[Turning in the games
that they each want to play.]

665
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:36,010
<i>Each team turned in three games each?</i>

666
00:37:36,010 --> 00:37:38,200
- Yes.
- The first game is...

667
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:41,020
- Okay, the first game.
- It's a game submitted by the Athletic Club.

668
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:45,980
<i>It's a relay game of who
can eat the fastest.</i>

669
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:49,490
[Speed eating relay...]

670
00:37:49,490 --> 00:37:51,960
- Who can eat the fastest.
- Ah, eating?

671
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:54,530
I already ate two ramens.

672
00:37:54,530 --> 00:37:56,540
This team's already full of food.

673
00:37:57,330 --> 00:37:59,860
[Current hot stars Woo Bin and Jong Suk still
have to remain cool when they eat?]

674
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:01,550
They've got the wrong idea.

675
00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:03,510
We've got good eaters over here too.

676
00:38:03,510 --> 00:38:06,330
- I'll show them what I'm capable of.
- I'll show them what tacky truly means.

677
00:38:07,470 --> 00:38:08,970
How are we going to do this?

678
00:38:08,970 --> 00:38:10,320
- We already have the food picked out.
- Okay.

679
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:13,440
Eggs, ice cream, ramen, chocolate,
water and cola.

680
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,200
The moment that someone says
start to the game...

681
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:18,850
we start eating the fastest we can in turn.
Once you're done eating, you have to whistle.

682
00:38:18,850 --> 00:38:21,200
[Before the next person can start,
the current eater must whistle.]

683
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:26,400
[1- Hard-boiled egg; 2- Cup ramen;
3- Ice cream; 4- Water; 5- Cola]

684
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,680
- Okay.
- Okay, I'm going to start the timer.

685
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:30,730
You don't need to drink the broth too
in the cup ramen, do you?

686
00:38:30,730 --> 00:38:32,870
You don't need to drink the broth too.
You just need to eat the noodles.

687
00:38:32,870 --> 00:38:34,640
Set... go!

688
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,800
Song Ji Hyo, take your time!

689
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,670
- Wow, you're eating that in one bite!
- There you go... nice!

690
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:45,020
- It's okay, take it easy.
- Just swallow!

691
00:38:45,370 --> 00:38:47,390
- Just swallow it.
- Don't push her.

692
00:38:47,390 --> 00:38:49,550
- It's okay, take it easy.
- This is a battle with your own self.

693
00:38:49,550 --> 00:38:51,280
It's okay, you can do it.

694
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:55,780
<i>Song Ji Hyo, lose!
Lose, Song Ji Hyo!</i>

695
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:57,150
Song Ji Hyo...

696
00:38:58,870 --> 00:39:02,620
[Almost...]

697
00:39:04,810 --> 00:39:06,580
- No, she didn't do it.
- Yes, she did!

698
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:08,750
- No, she's all set.
- She ate it all.

699
00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:10,960
[Next up is cup ramen!]

700
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,380
[Burns his mouth by trying to eat it
without even blowing on it first.]

701
00:39:20,490 --> 00:39:23,780
- Lose, Gary! Lose, Gary!
- You're almost there! Just a little bit more!

702
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:27,040
[Remaining unafraid of
such little things as heat.]

703
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:31,270
- You're almost there!
- You don't need to drink the broth!

704
00:39:31,270 --> 00:39:32,860
Blow on it a little!
You'll burn yourself!

705
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:37,870
[Is he already done eating?]

706
00:39:38,870 --> 00:39:41,210
[Heat over taste.]

707
00:39:41,210 --> 00:39:43,250
- You're there.
- You're done eating, so whistle.

708
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:44,460
[Is he embarrassed?]

709
00:39:54,530 --> 00:39:56,710
[Three: Ice cream]

710
00:39:56,710 --> 00:39:58,380
[Brain freeze]

711
00:39:58,970 --> 00:40:01,180
[Ice blast to the brain.]

712
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:04,970
- Just shove it in there!
- You have to eat it faster!

713
00:40:04,970 --> 00:40:06,440
Just shove it in there!

714
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:09,600
Lose, Ji Suk Jin!
Lose, Ji Suk Jin!

715
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:11,490
- Don't even think about spitting it out!
- Just endure it!

716
00:40:11,490 --> 00:40:13,210
- You can do this!
- Just endure it!

717
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:14,460
Here, drink some of this ramen broth!

718
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:16,260
[Ramen broth?]

719
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:21,160
- Hurry, hurry!
- That is so disgusting!

720
00:40:21,930 --> 00:40:23,710
[The broth seem to be working.]

721
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:31,150
[Now he just needs to whistle!]

722
00:40:31,150 --> 00:40:33,120
You've still got it, Ji Suk Jin!

723
00:40:33,770 --> 00:40:34,930
He did it!

724
00:40:35,990 --> 00:40:37,490
[Four: Chocolate]

725
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:41,380
[Oh my!]

726
00:40:44,170 --> 00:40:47,040
[Human chocolate grinder.]

727
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:51,600
[Did you see that?]

728
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:56,350
[You're all dead!]

729
00:40:59,970 --> 00:41:02,860
[The inventor of the game who scarfed down the
food in an amazingly short amount of time.]

730
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:06,430
- Hurry up and swallow it!
- One, two, three!

731
00:41:06,430 --> 00:41:07,990
- He can't.
- He can't do it yet.

732
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:10,070
He ate it too fast.
There's too much left in his mouth.

733
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:14,930
[He still has a mouth full of chocolate.]

734
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:16,630
<i>Ha Ha, you can't do it!</i>

735
00:41:16,630 --> 00:41:18,240
- He did it!
- Okay!

736
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:20,800
[Five: Bottled water]

737
00:41:25,230 --> 00:41:27,920
- How is he doing that?
- Does he have a water faucet in there?

738
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,480
He's like a water faucet.

739
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:31,830
[He looks like he's going to
succeed in a single swallow!]

740
00:41:32,470 --> 00:41:34,940
[Huh?]

741
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:41,720
[Why would he hit his throat?]

742
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:44,120
You have to do it over!

743
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:46,890
[Calms down and finishes the rest.]

744
00:41:49,510 --> 00:41:52,170
- Why would you hit my neck?
- He's not very good.

745
00:41:52,170 --> 00:41:53,560
[The final bottle of cola.
Giraffe drinking it down like lightening!]

746
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:59,190
How is he drinking cola like that?

747
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:02,790
[Guzzling it down as if he's
putting gas in the car.]

748
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:06,150
[Wow! Already finished!]

749
00:42:08,930 --> 00:42:10,820
Are you a giraffe or something?

750
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:13,170
[Amazing]

751
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:20,770
[Oh my...]

752
00:42:21,550 --> 00:42:23,740
[He's supposed to whistle,
but another sound comes out of his mouth...]

753
00:42:27,530 --> 00:42:31,740
[The store breaks out in an uproar
with that one sound.]

754
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:35,280
[Trying to remain calm.]

755
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:42,670
[Athletic Club finishes all six rounds.]

756
00:42:44,550 --> 00:42:50,440
[Athletic Club's record is...
Four minutes and 55 seconds.]

757
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:57,130
[Will the Theater Club be able to beat
four minutes and 55 seconds?]

758
00:42:57,630 --> 00:42:59,270
You just watch what we do.

759
00:43:00,250 --> 00:43:02,420
[Hyo Rin to start off by eating
the hard-boiled egg.]

760
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:03,880
<i>Set... go!</i>

761
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:07,940
There you go!
Hyo Rin knows what she's doing!

762
00:43:07,950 --> 00:43:09,980
Hyo Rin's played a little back in her day!

763
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:13,020
[Played a little back in her day?
Hyo Rin peels the egg without any hesitation!]

764
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:14,910
<i>That's right!
Hyo Rin knows what she's doing!</i>

765
00:43:14,910 --> 00:43:17,850
[I'm Min Hyo Rin...]

766
00:43:17,850 --> 00:43:22,710
[Do I looked like I played around
a bit back in the day?]

767
00:43:23,470 --> 00:43:25,640
[Scarfs down]

768
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:28,780
That's right! Look at her!
She's definitely played around a bit!

769
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:33,840
- Did you see the way she smacked her egg?
- You've played around a bit, haven't you?

770
00:43:34,270 --> 00:43:36,010
<i>One more... one more bite.</i>

771
00:43:36,610 --> 00:43:38,580
<i>- Okay, you got it.
- She can eat really fast.</i>

772
00:43:38,580 --> 00:43:41,640
<i>It's not easy.
Whistling isn't going to be easy.</i>

773
00:43:42,460 --> 00:43:43,880
- Okay!
- She hasn't whistled yet.

774
00:43:44,410 --> 00:43:45,540
She's got it!

775
00:43:46,410 --> 00:43:49,170
[Now it's Woo Bin's turn
to eat the cup ramen.]

776
00:43:49,170 --> 00:43:50,620
<i>Show them how you can eat that.</i>

777
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:55,200
Hurry up and eat it.
Why are you blowing on it? Just eat it.

778
00:43:57,500 --> 00:44:01,140
[Quite cautious unlike his
tough guy image?]

779
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:03,660
You have to eat it quick.
That's right. Nice, Woo Bin.

780
00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:05,050
Nice, nice!

781
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:10,740
Hey, Gary...
he's quite a different picture from you.

782
00:44:13,910 --> 00:44:15,450
Is that the way you're
supposed to eat?

783
00:44:17,130 --> 00:44:18,650
Done. He's done with the ramen.

784
00:44:19,150 --> 00:44:21,250
Woo Bin, you have to whistle now.

785
00:44:21,970 --> 00:44:25,290
[Are his eyes starting to water?]

786
00:44:25,290 --> 00:44:27,380
- It's okay!
- It's okay, Woo Bin! Don't cry!

787
00:44:27,690 --> 00:44:30,000
- Don't cry!
- Don't cry!

788
00:44:30,590 --> 00:44:31,880
<i>He got it!</i>

789
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:34,100
- You know what to do, right, Jong Suk?
- You can do this, Jong Suk!

790
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:36,440
That's right!

791
00:44:43,390 --> 00:44:45,890
[Automatically reaching for the
ramen broth.]

792
00:44:45,890 --> 00:44:47,990
- Just once... just once.
- He can only have one sip!

793
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:53,760
- Did the ramen broth help!
- We're all set!

794
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:55,860
[Predicting their win?]

795
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:58,750
- Lee Jong Suk!
- Eat it slow!

796
00:45:01,730 --> 00:45:02,950
Jong Suk...

797
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:04,870
[The unbearable cold...]

798
00:45:05,310 --> 00:45:06,620
It's okay, Jong Suk!

799
00:45:07,950 --> 00:45:09,350
Jong Suk, it's okay!

800
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:14,760
[Suddenly bouncing around?]

801
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:16,280
<i>But he still looks cool.</i>

802
00:45:16,870 --> 00:45:19,900
[Even as he's chomping down on his ice cream,
he's still maintaining his cool image.]

803
00:45:20,910 --> 00:45:22,060
He did it!

804
00:45:22,060 --> 00:45:24,340
[The Game Adversary Soo Ro's turn
to eat the chocolate bar.]

805
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:30,320
[Scarfing down]

806
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:34,120
- You dropped some. Over here, here...
- That doesn't matter.

807
00:45:40,660 --> 00:45:44,000
[The single shot of chocolate is too much
for even Soo Ro with his sweet tooth?]

808
00:45:46,230 --> 00:45:49,010
[With his gaze fixed on something afar,
he shoves more chocolate in his mouth.]

809
00:45:49,010 --> 00:45:50,170
Why don't you put another piece in?

810
00:45:50,170 --> 00:45:51,230
[Wait, wait!]

811
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:58,120
[Shoves the final piece
of chocolate in his mouth.]

812
00:45:59,930 --> 00:46:01,950
<i>- I bet his mouth is too dry.
- You got it!</i>

813
00:46:01,950 --> 00:46:03,430
You got it!

814
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:05,610
[Jong Hyun's turn to drink the water.]

815
00:46:05,610 --> 00:46:07,700
Here's finally something Jong Hyun's good at!

816
00:46:09,550 --> 00:46:10,820
[Anxious]

817
00:46:12,260 --> 00:46:16,090
[Already having stopped once,
how will he do this time?]

818
00:46:16,090 --> 00:46:17,970
<i>He's not going to make it.</i>

819
00:46:18,470 --> 00:46:19,890
[Hm?]

820
00:46:19,890 --> 00:46:22,060
- There's some left!
- There's still some left!

821
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:23,870
[Total chaos]

822
00:46:29,050 --> 00:46:30,840
- He's got it.
- He has to whistle!

823
00:46:32,830 --> 00:46:33,920
- He's got it!
- Drink the cola!

824
00:46:34,070 --> 00:46:36,320
[Final round! Jae Suk's turn with the cola.]

825
00:46:41,220 --> 00:46:43,530
[Barely suppresses his reflex
to spew it out.]

826
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:53,180
[Same thing as the Giraffe.]

827
00:46:54,330 --> 00:46:55,480
It's not easy.

828
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:56,980
[Impossible to whistle.]

829
00:47:04,190 --> 00:47:07,100
[Theater Club completes their mission.]

830
00:47:08,170 --> 00:47:12,600
[Were they faster than the Athletic Club's
four minute and 55 second record?]

831
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:16,020
We were much faster.

832
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:18,500
- I don't know how this is going to turn out.
- I think we did better than them.

833
00:47:18,660 --> 00:47:21,860
[The Athletic Club's record was
four minutes and 55 seconds...]

834
00:47:21,860 --> 00:47:23,410
[The Theater Club's record is in
the four minute range!]

835
00:47:23,410 --> 00:47:25,520
You know it can't be 57 or 58 seconds.

836
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:28,900
- 58... 58 seconds.
- Four minutes...

837
00:47:30,210 --> 00:47:31,660
47 seconds!

838
00:47:31,660 --> 00:47:33,270
[Theater Club:
Four minutes and 47 seconds.]

839
00:47:33,270 --> 00:47:35,410
[Theater Club wins!]

840
00:47:37,130 --> 00:47:38,710
[The reason for their defeat
is the Giraffe?]

841
00:47:38,710 --> 00:47:41,860
- We did it.
- Jong Hyun, for the first time on the show...

842
00:47:44,180 --> 00:47:45,670
<i>The current score is one to one.</i>

843
00:47:45,670 --> 00:47:48,270
<i>The final game will be a game
submitted by the Theater Club...</i>

844
00:47:48,270 --> 00:47:50,000
<i>and it's a relay of the splits.</i>

845
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,160
[Current score is tied and the final
game is 'Relay of the splits'!]

846
00:47:53,170 --> 00:47:54,960
- How are we supposed to do that?
- No kidding.

847
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:57,460
- Most of them have long legs.
- How are we supposed to do that?

848
00:47:57,460 --> 00:47:59,390
- It's to see who can get the longest length?
- Yes.

849
00:47:59,390 --> 00:48:02,170
[The team to get the longest distance by
connecting their legs in a split position wins.]

850
00:48:02,420 --> 00:48:03,970
Don't you think this is unfairly
advantageous for you guys?

851
00:48:03,970 --> 00:48:06,080
No, we didn't.
Can't we just have fun with this?

852
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:07,850
Look at how long their legs are!

853
00:48:07,850 --> 00:48:09,930
These guys aren't the most
athletic people.

854
00:48:09,930 --> 00:48:12,690
[Their physical stature may be superior,
but their athletic abilities are unknown?]

855
00:48:14,620 --> 00:48:16,370
I'll go first.

856
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:19,230
- You know that I'm not good at this, right?
- Yeah, I know that.

857
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:21,240
<i>You need to change your pants
before you do that</i>

858
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:23,880
They all need to connect in a line.

859
00:48:23,980 --> 00:48:26,050
What are you doing over there?

860
00:48:26,050 --> 00:48:27,840
[A barrage of criticism]

861
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:29,660
I'm just trying to stretch out my legs!

862
00:48:31,410 --> 00:48:34,820
[Keeps on getting into strange poses.]

863
00:48:36,140 --> 00:48:38,970
What?
I have my own style of doing this!

864
00:48:38,980 --> 00:48:41,300
[Everyone shocked at his way of
doing the splits.]

865
00:48:50,410 --> 00:48:53,120
[Screaming out in agony from having
to withstand holding the position.]

866
00:48:54,630 --> 00:48:55,730
Hyo Rin...

867
00:48:55,730 --> 00:48:58,810
[Rule: The next person's foot must touch
the foot of the person in front of them.]

868
00:49:01,150 --> 00:49:03,290
[With her strength...]

869
00:49:03,990 --> 00:49:05,040
Hurry up and get next to her.

870
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:07,160
- What do I do?
- Your foot has to touch hers.

871
00:49:07,170 --> 00:49:10,870
[Okay, it's our turn now...]

872
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:17,290
[Woo Bin and Jong Suk with their
superior statures.]

873
00:49:17,290 --> 00:49:21,400
[Will they be able to stretch out
like they strut down the runway?]

874
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:27,360
- Your foot has to touch hers.
- Hurry up!

875
00:49:29,810 --> 00:49:31,290
Hurry up!

876
00:49:31,290 --> 00:49:33,930
Hurry!

877
00:49:34,700 --> 00:49:37,080
[Huh?]

878
00:49:38,590 --> 00:49:40,970
[That's it?]

879
00:49:45,860 --> 00:49:51,180
[They are longer, but their flexibility...]

880
00:49:51,180 --> 00:49:53,080
That's not going to be enough!

881
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:54,630
Go further... stretch out further.

882
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:56,970
They're not as flexible
as I thought they'd be.

883
00:50:01,270 --> 00:50:04,560
[We suggested this game thinking
we'd have an advantage...]

884
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:06,430
Jong Suk, stretch out more!

885
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:08,700
Woo Bin!

886
00:50:08,700 --> 00:50:10,360
Jong Hyun!

887
00:50:14,020 --> 00:50:15,310
<i>They're all so tall.</i>

888
00:50:18,790 --> 00:50:20,540
[Finally, it's the Game Adversary's turn.]

889
00:50:20,540 --> 00:50:21,920
Woo Bin!

890
00:50:23,710 --> 00:50:25,180
Jong Hyun!

891
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:33,170
[What will be the record for this tall bunch?]

892
00:50:39,810 --> 00:50:42,740
[Marking the spot with
a piece of white tape.]

893
00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:50,250
<i>They got a good distance.</i>

894
00:50:50,250 --> 00:50:52,350
<i>It's a bit longer than it was originally.</i>

895
00:50:53,060 --> 00:50:58,230
Look at him... what's he doing?
He's pulling out his socks further.

896
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:06,570
- That's cheating!
- We don't have to accept it though.

897
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:09,540
[Stretching out this side too.]

898
00:51:11,540 --> 00:51:13,320
[What?]

899
00:51:14,310 --> 00:51:17,440
[Eliminating the trickster.]

900
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:20,790
[The Giraffe suddenly finds
himself barefoot.]

901
00:51:22,030 --> 00:51:23,580
You saw that, right?
You saw what Soo Ro did?

902
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:25,740
He doesn't care about being fun
or entertaining at all.

903
00:51:25,740 --> 00:51:28,610
Why do we have to live to
be entertaining for others?

904
00:51:29,430 --> 00:51:30,900
Okay, you can do it now.

905
00:51:30,900 --> 00:51:34,530
- Suk Jin, you start first.
- Here, bend your knee like this.

906
00:51:34,530 --> 00:51:36,990
[Captain Capable's instructions
on how to do a proper splits.]

907
00:51:40,070 --> 00:51:42,280
Why am I the first one to go?

908
00:51:43,430 --> 00:51:45,270
- This hurts! Hurry up!
- Do it just like he did.

909
00:51:46,420 --> 00:51:49,420
[A game that incites their anger even
if it's dragged out a second too long.]

910
00:51:49,420 --> 00:51:51,070
Ji Hyo, you're doing great!

911
00:51:51,070 --> 00:51:52,370
Ji Hyo, that's good!

912
00:51:52,370 --> 00:51:54,250
- You have to do the same.
- Hurry!

913
00:51:55,770 --> 00:51:57,080
Hurry up and do it!

914
00:51:58,700 --> 00:52:02,430
[Must hold the position for five seconds after
the last person is in position to count.]

915
00:52:08,350 --> 00:52:12,270
[Will they be able to break
the Theater Club's record?]

916
00:52:17,940 --> 00:52:19,500
[Theater Club's record.]

917
00:52:25,550 --> 00:52:27,890
[If their feet aren't touching,
then it doesn't count.]

918
00:52:29,660 --> 00:52:32,040
[Will they?]

919
00:52:32,410 --> 00:52:35,280
- They're touching... they're touching.
- Hurry!

920
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:47,360
[What's the Athletic Club's record?]

921
00:52:50,550 --> 00:52:51,690
Hurry!

922
00:52:56,300 --> 00:52:57,560
We won!

923
00:52:57,560 --> 00:52:59,750
[They beat the record!]

924
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:04,390
[Athletic Club wins the splits game!]

925
00:53:16,650 --> 00:53:19,320
<i>Athletic Club wins the
snack store game.</i>

926
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:21,160
[Three rounds of snack shop games,
Athletic Club wins!]

927
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:26,490
<i>You still got it, Athletic Club!</i>

928
00:53:28,370 --> 00:53:30,800
Since we lost this game because of me,
I'll take care of the tab.

929
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:31,870
[Soo Ro is taking care of the bill?]

930
00:53:31,870 --> 00:53:33,190
How much is it?

931
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:37,870
[Athletic Team takes the flag again.]

932
00:53:41,900 --> 00:53:46,240
[After having changed their clothes,
Athletic Club is the first to enter the pool.]

933
00:53:48,150 --> 00:53:50,390
[But...]

934
00:53:50,390 --> 00:53:53,620
[What is that on top of the water?]

935
00:53:53,620 --> 00:53:57,180
[A giant platform divided into two parts.
Could this be?]

936
00:54:01,270 --> 00:54:04,740
[Even entering the water is a form of
training for the Athletic Club.]

937
00:54:10,110 --> 00:54:12,610
- Athletic!
- Athletic!

938
00:54:14,580 --> 00:54:19,700
[As for the Theater Club, even entering
the water is like a scene out of teen drama.]

939
00:54:19,700 --> 00:54:21,690
Look at how well-mannered they are.

940
00:54:25,590 --> 00:54:26,980
[Say what?]

941
00:54:27,850 --> 00:54:29,600
[Not the least bit threatening.]

942
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:31,230
Look at what this guy looks like.

943
00:54:31,990 --> 00:54:35,970
[Mr. Capable's threatening looking muscles.]

944
00:54:38,860 --> 00:54:40,580
He has a washboard stomach!

945
00:54:44,980 --> 00:54:49,200
[He must've been shocked from
having seen Mr. Capable's washboard abs.]

946
00:54:55,770 --> 00:54:57,720
[Theater Club is a bit worrisome.]

947
00:54:58,370 --> 00:55:00,910
<i>Athletic Club and the Theater Club...</i>

948
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:03,570

00:55:31,390 --> 00:55:34,430
- Come here!
- I'm going to shove three of you off!

954
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:37,490
<i>Get ready for your first round...</i>

[Aquatic Battle:
First round - start!]

956
00:55:40,630 --> 00:55:42,410
Get a good hold of Jong Kook.

[Jong Kook vs. Jae Suk]

958
00:55:48,590 --> 00:55:49,970
Min Hyo Rin, you come out here!

[Big-nosed Brother targets
Min Hyo Rin as his target?]

961

- Min Hyo Rin, come out here!
- Stop hiding and come out here.

962
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:01,980
We vow to eliminate you.

963
00:56:04,340 --> 00:56:06,690
When Ho Dong used to do it in the past,
it was actually kind of scary, wasn't it?

964
00:56:07,510 --> 00:56:09,360
Ho Dong used to be very good
at things like this.

965
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:10,580
Ho Dong's really good at this stuff.

966
00:56:10,580 --> 00:56:12,920
Ho Dong even flipped Jong Kook
over in a backflip once.

967
00:56:14,060 --> 00:56:16,670
[I'm the one who did the flipping...]

968

[This scene that's still
crystal clear in our memory.]

<i>Oh, you flipped him over?</i>

970
00:56:26,620 --> 00:56:28,650
Then I guess I'll be an easy one
for you to flip over?

971
00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:31,570
[Would you like for me to flip you over?]

972
00:56:31,570 --> 00:56:33,330
Shouldn't Soo Ro be stepping up
to the front from your team?

973
00:56:33,330 --> 00:56:35,450
Someone needs to be a fodder
for the cannon blasts.

974
00:56:36,730 --> 00:56:37,930
What do you mean, a cannon fodder?

975
00:56:37,930 --> 00:56:40,480
I'm about to take one for the team
standing up front like this.

976
00:56:43,060 --> 00:56:46,430
[Ten years... shaved off of his life.]

977

[How is he saying he's going to
protect anything in that state?]

978
00:56:51,580 --> 00:56:53,450
You've still got it, Kim Jong Kook!

979
00:56:54,860 --> 00:56:57,470
Hey, hey, hey...
Don't be scared, Woo Bin.

980
00:56:57,470 --> 00:56:58,820
Don't be scared.

981
00:57:02,660 --> 00:57:04,040
Wait, hang on...

982
00:57:04,050 --> 00:57:06,190
Why am I the one standing
up front like this?

983
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:11,240
[When all the other men of the Theater Club
are taller and studier than he is?]

984
00:57:12,090 --> 00:57:14,220
When you're all sturdier than I am,
why am I standing up here?

985
00:57:14,220 --> 00:57:15,860
You're all...

986
00:57:18,170 --> 00:57:20,770
[A hundred years shaved off of his life.]

00:57:21,560 --> 00:57:22,910
You're all scaredy cats!

988

If it wasn't for Kim Jong Kook,
you'd all be nothing but bowling pins!

[They'd all be bowling pins
without Jong Kook?]

990

[A cluttered mess]

991
00:57:32,410 --> 00:57:34,730
[Okay... now's the chance!]

992
00:57:36,190 --> 00:57:38,840
[Mr. Capable attacks!]

993
00:57:46,410 --> 00:57:49,770
[A tangled mess in moments!]

994
00:57:51,110 --> 00:57:53,260
[Submerging as a group!]

995
00:58:02,350 --> 00:58:05,090
[With Mr. Capable's barreling attack,
everyone's eliminated as a bunch!]

996
00:58:05,090 --> 00:58:08,990
[With Kwang Soo eliminating Jong Suk,
and Suk Jin shoving Hyo Rin off...]

997
00:58:08,990 --> 00:58:12,350
[The first round is
the Athletic Club's win!]

998
00:58:13,700 --> 00:58:16,670
[Still flabbergasted with it having
happened in a blink of an eye.]

999
00:58:22,810 --> 00:58:26,180
[Jong Hyun's legs already
giving out on him.]

1000
00:58:26,520 --> 00:58:28,770
What's wrong with this Theater Club?

1001
00:58:28,770 --> 00:58:31,630
[At this rate, the Theater Club
may not win a single round?]

1002
00:58:31,630 --> 00:58:33,760
You guys are way too easy.

1003
00:58:36,630 --> 00:58:39,750
- The first round goes to the Athletic Club.
- Let's go.

1004
00:58:41,430 --> 00:58:44,110
[Gary up to the front lines?]

1005
00:58:44,110 --> 00:58:45,770
[And Theater Club's front line
is headed by Jong Suk!]

1006
00:58:45,770 --> 00:58:47,830
Gary's not going to be an easy opponent.
He's very strong.

1007
00:58:47,830 --> 00:58:49,990
[Round two of aquatic battle starts now!]

1008
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,080
Is this an individual fight?
It is, isn't it?

1009
00:58:53,690 --> 00:58:57,020
[Initial battle of the wills
while carefully testing each other out.]

1010
00:59:04,820 --> 00:59:06,340
[Even though Jong Suk attacked...]

1011
00:59:06,340 --> 00:59:09,410
[It's Gary who wins the fight.]

1012
00:59:09,410 --> 00:59:11,250
[Ah...]

1013
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,460
[Was that too cool of me?]

1014
00:59:18,560 --> 00:59:19,840
I told you to take him seriously.

1015
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:26,970
[Jong Hyun steps up next.]

1016
00:59:26,970 --> 00:59:29,090
All kill!
All kill!

1017
00:59:30,470 --> 00:59:35,510
[Black belt in judo Jong Hyun
vs. Sometimes Mr. Capable, Gary.]

1018
00:59:39,170 --> 00:59:41,270
[Jong Hyun uses his judo moves
to attack.]

1019
00:59:41,270 --> 00:59:43,640
[There they go!]

1020
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:54,020
[Wow, even Jong Hyun...
is beaten by Gary's attack.]

1021
00:59:56,620 --> 01:00:00,250
[I'm... so cool...]

1022
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:09,730
[Will Gary seriously be able to
eliminate them all on his own?]

1023
01:00:10,350 --> 01:00:12,390
[Theater Club's Woo Bin!]

1024
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:26,500
[Gary barreling down!]

1025
01:00:34,260 --> 01:00:39,330
[Wow! Twists his body around
to push Gary into the water!]

1026
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:41,290
Come out here, Suk Jin.

1027
01:00:41,630 --> 01:00:42,970
Min Hyo Rin, come out here.

1028
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:47,790
[By requests from the others,
it's Suk Jin vs. Jae Suk.]

1029
01:00:47,790 --> 01:00:51,000
- Go up there.
- Then who's going to take Hyo Rin?

1030
01:00:54,810 --> 01:00:59,200
[Threatening him with his
lightening quick shadow boxing moves?]

1031
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:00,700
We can't even see his moves!

1032
01:01:03,510 --> 01:01:04,970
Look at how fast you are!

1033
01:01:09,720 --> 01:01:11,990
[There they go!]

1034
01:01:14,650 --> 01:01:15,810
Nice!

1035
01:01:15,850 --> 01:01:20,080
[Without even having done anything...]

1036
01:01:20,080 --> 01:01:24,050
[What the heck...]

1037
01:01:25,470 --> 01:01:26,700
Come on!

1038
01:01:29,190 --> 01:01:31,110
[Athletic Club's Haroro!]

1039
01:01:31,110 --> 01:01:32,910
- Show him what you've got!
- Okay!

1040
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:37,840
[Both trying to make their
build look bigger?]

1041
01:01:42,440 --> 01:01:46,110
[Huh? Why is he flopping around?]

1042
01:01:48,650 --> 01:01:50,280
Ha Ha, what are you doing?

1043
01:01:51,010 --> 01:01:53,450
[Gollum attack mode.]

1044
01:01:56,640 --> 01:01:58,980
[Just what kind of a strategy is this?]

1045
01:02:00,080 --> 01:02:01,390
I can't even think straight.

1046
01:02:10,630 --> 01:02:13,460
[Is he planning on pushing Jae Suk
off the platform like this?]

1047
01:02:14,370 --> 01:02:16,310
[Jae Suk barely manages to
keep himself on the platform!]

1048
01:02:21,780 --> 01:02:23,030
Nice going!

1049
01:02:23,500 --> 01:02:27,640
[Ultimately being reduced to fighting
like a couple of neighborhood kids?]

1050
01:02:30,570 --> 01:02:33,030
[It's time for me to step in.]

1051
01:02:33,030 --> 01:02:35,610
[Soo Ro's surprise attack!]

1052
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:40,250
[Pushing off Kwang Soo and
Soo Ro as a pair?]

1053
01:02:43,830 --> 01:02:45,790
[Who is this?]

1054
01:02:46,770 --> 01:02:49,720
[Woo bin sees a chance and charges...]

1055
01:02:56,740 --> 01:02:58,820
[The scene that you just witnessed...]

1056
01:03:01,710 --> 01:03:05,280
[In his attempt to attack,
Mr. Capable just shoves him off.]

1057
01:03:09,120 --> 01:03:11,860
[Jae Suk and Hyo Rin are the only
survivors of the Theater Club!]

1058
01:03:16,380 --> 01:03:18,930
[Hyo Rin gathers up her courage
to rescue her teammate!]

1059
01:03:21,610 --> 01:03:24,010
[Complete chaos]

1060
01:03:26,040 --> 01:03:29,310
[May be too much for the Theater Club.]

1061
01:03:30,970 --> 01:03:33,710
[Mr. Capable lifting up Jae Suk
to throw him in the water.]

1062
01:03:39,190 --> 01:03:42,070
[But Jae Suk withstands his maneuver!]

1063
01:03:44,650 --> 01:03:46,720
[Jong Kook loses his grip!]

1064
01:03:47,540 --> 01:03:49,200
[How can this be?]

1065
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:51,740
[Jong Kook is eliminated!]

1066
01:03:55,560 --> 01:03:58,270
[Jae Suk's unbelievable strength!]

1067
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:07,090
[Using his strength to throw
Ha Ha in the water next!]

1068
01:04:11,830 --> 01:04:17,690
[And as for the sole survivor, Ji Hyo...]

1069
01:04:19,250 --> 01:04:22,870
[Theater Club wins!
Jae Suk pulls it off!]

1070
01:04:25,820 --> 01:04:27,570
Jae Suk is no joke!

1071
01:04:28,320 --> 01:04:33,320
[Nice going, Yoo Jae Suk!
With his determination to win!]

1072
01:04:34,530 --> 01:04:38,000
- Suk Jin and Kwang Soo next?
- No more breaks.

1073
01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:41,820
[Used up all his energy.]

1074
01:04:46,200 --> 01:04:47,620
I need to get rid of Jae Suk first.

1075
01:04:49,870 --> 01:04:51,280
I need to get rid of him first.

1076
01:04:54,030 --> 01:04:55,440
Move, move!

1077
01:04:56,790 --> 01:04:59,640
[There's a time and place
for everything...]

1078
01:05:12,120 --> 01:05:13,490
I'm just going to come
charging ahead.

1079
01:05:15,120 --> 01:05:17,030
- Watch out before you fall in.
- Ha Ha, get out!

1080
01:05:18,870 --> 01:05:21,430
[We told you not to get involved...]

1081
01:05:22,790 --> 01:05:26,490
Ha Ha... don't you think you're being
too much to your own teammates?

1082
01:05:29,330 --> 01:05:32,620
[Anyway, the third round of the
Aquatic Battle starts now!]

1083
01:05:33,080 --> 01:05:35,280
I have to attack his balance.

1084
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:36,640
Give it your best shot.

1085
01:05:45,060 --> 01:05:46,900
[You've lost your own balance?]

1086
01:05:48,710 --> 01:05:52,320
[Battle of the wills from the two
team leaders continues!]

1087
01:06:05,310 --> 01:06:06,670
You deserved it!

1088
01:06:08,600 --> 01:06:09,970
Come out here right now.

1089
01:06:16,040 --> 01:06:18,390
[At last, Soo Ro steps up
to the front lines.]

1090
01:06:23,460 --> 01:06:27,770
[Soo Ro undoubtedly had a plan
when he stepped up to the front...]

1091
01:06:33,900 --> 01:06:36,060
[There he goes!]

1092
01:06:52,260 --> 01:06:54,400
[A blunt attack!]

1093
01:06:58,940 --> 01:07:02,300
[This is the true image of
Game Adversary Soo Ro!]

1094
01:07:05,970 --> 01:07:07,800
[Still unable to comprehend
what just happened.]

1095
01:07:11,260 --> 01:07:15,380
[The Game Adversary is back!]

1096
01:07:17,020 --> 01:07:19,580
[Second period, special activity...]

1097
01:07:19,580 --> 01:07:23,010
[Theater Club wins!]

1098
01:07:27,580 --> 01:07:30,910
[Arrives at school,
their final battleground.]

1099
01:07:31,980 --> 01:07:34,110
[Who will be the
ultimate club left remaining?]

1100
01:07:36,490 --> 01:07:40,890
[Theater Club confident with
the flag now in their possession.]

1101
01:07:42,410 --> 01:07:44,340
[Athletic Club also enters
the school hallway.]

1102
01:07:44,340 --> 01:07:46,180
<i>This is your final mission.</i>

1103
01:07:46,720 --> 01:07:52,330
<i>Throughout this school,
you will find several flag poles.</i>

1104
01:07:52,330 --> 01:07:53,380
What about it?

1105
01:08:01,750 --> 01:08:04,690
[There are five flag poles per club.]

1106
01:08:04,700 --> 01:08:09,300
[Athletic Club - White flag poles.
Theater Club - Blue flag poles.]

1107
01:08:09,300 --> 01:08:13,200
[Time on the clock to steal the flag:
30 minutes.]

1108
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:19,460
[The team who's flag pole holds the flag at
the end of the allotted time is the winner.]

1109
01:08:19,460 --> 01:08:22,360
[But, if the flag is kept in the flagpole
for a minute at any time, it's also a win!]

1110
01:08:22,360 --> 01:08:25,400
<i>If you can keep the flag in the flagpole
for a minute without having it stolen...</i>

1111
01:08:25,400 --> 01:08:26,700
<i>then you win the game.</i>

1112
01:08:26,700 --> 01:08:29,410
So the important thing is to hide the flag
for now and find the flag post first?

1113
01:08:29,410 --> 01:08:33,170
<i>But if the flag is found by the other team
while you have it hidden...</i>

1114
01:08:33,170 --> 01:08:35,640
We're not going to hide it anywhere
where they can find it.

1115
01:08:35,640 --> 01:08:37,160
I'm Kim Soo Ro.

1116
01:08:38,550 --> 01:08:42,150
He just knocked off the other team
like a stack of bowling pins.

1117
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:45,430
He just swept them off
like they're nothing.

1118
01:08:45,430 --> 01:08:48,940
<i>We're going to start the game
in your own classroom.</i>

1119
01:08:48,940 --> 01:08:50,130
<i>All of the rooms are different.</i>

1120
01:09:02,810 --> 01:09:04,440
Flagpole...

1121
01:09:04,440 --> 01:09:05,750
Flagstaff...

1122
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:11,850
[Everyone's waiting in their own
classroom full of nervous energy.]

1123
01:09:15,760 --> 01:09:17,760
[Huh?]

1124
01:09:19,160 --> 01:09:21,800
[Jong Suk enjoying his moment
of relaxation.]

1125
01:09:23,320 --> 01:09:24,780
I really want to fight.

1126
01:09:26,320 --> 01:09:30,930
[Betrayal mania who wants to get the flag
in his hands as quickly as possible.]

1127
01:09:30,930 --> 01:09:32,570
I want to hang the flag in
our own flag post.

1128
01:09:35,060 --> 01:09:38,460
<i>And now...
we will start our final race.</i>

1129
01:09:38,940 --> 01:09:42,450
<i>And now...
we will start our final race.</i>

1130
01:09:42,450 --> 01:09:44,100
[The time has come...]

1131
01:09:44,100 --> 01:09:47,150
[Steal the flag - Race start!]

1132
01:09:47,990 --> 01:09:49,860
[Time on the clock: 30 minutes!]

1133
01:09:51,790 --> 01:09:55,430
[Theater Club vs. Athletic Club!
The final battle starts now!]

1134
01:09:58,890 --> 01:10:03,350
[Which of the Theater Club members
has the school flag?]

1135
01:10:06,740 --> 01:10:10,620
Don't you think Soo Ro would have it?
I'm positive that he'd have the flag.

1136
01:10:12,140 --> 01:10:14,610
[Blank Ji slowly on the move.]

1137
01:10:19,480 --> 01:10:21,840
There you go pretending
not to notice anything again!

1138
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:23,910
When did I ever do that?
When?

1139
01:10:23,910 --> 01:10:27,040
- I know everything I need to know!
- I have no interest in you!

1140
01:10:27,050 --> 01:10:28,880
I don't have any interest
in you either!

1141
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:30,620
- Look at you trying to look young...
- What?

1142
01:10:30,620 --> 01:10:32,570
Why are you wearing that weird hat
as if you were a kid?

1143
01:10:32,570 --> 01:10:34,640
- You really shouldn't be doing that!
- Seriously...

1144
01:10:37,660 --> 01:10:40,340
- Where did you hide it?
- We don't know either.

1145
01:10:40,340 --> 01:10:43,890
- Where is it? I don't see it.
- I don't know, but I don't have it.

1146
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:46,480
Oh, there's a flagpole right here.

1147
01:10:46,480 --> 01:10:48,550
[Jong Kook and Ha Ha in the
auditorium on the second floor.]

1148
01:10:48,550 --> 01:10:50,110
[Discovers the flagpoles!]

1149
01:10:50,110 --> 01:10:52,450
If they try to hang the flag here,
we can just steal it from them.

1150
01:10:56,890 --> 01:10:58,440
Here it is.

1151
01:10:59,060 --> 01:11:02,880
[Woo Bin also discovers a flagpole
for his team on the fifth floor.]

1152
01:11:07,850 --> 01:11:09,440
- You scared me!
- You have it, don't you?

1153
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:11,670
I don't have it.
I really don't have the flag.

1154
01:11:12,590 --> 01:11:13,910
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

1155

[Running away for now?]

1156
01:11:16,910 --> 01:11:18,210
I really don't have it!

1157
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:21,920
You scared me.

1158
01:11:24,780 --> 01:11:27,170
[Jae Suk's surprise attack.]

1159
01:11:27,170 --> 01:11:29,620
You scared me.
But I like being scared like this.

1160
01:11:29,630 --> 01:11:31,590
- Really?
- I'm a scaredy-mania.

1161
01:11:31,820 --> 01:11:33,280
Nice going.

1162
01:11:33,620 --> 01:11:36,240
Following around girls who are
younger than you like that.

1163
01:11:36,240 --> 01:11:37,590
- Follow around?
- Of course.

1164
01:11:37,590 --> 01:11:40,080
[Getting into a battle whenever
they run into each other.]

1165
01:11:40,090 --> 01:11:42,620
Did you not see me just trying
to carry out my mission?

1166
01:11:42,620 --> 01:11:43,630
What did you say?

1167
01:11:43,630 --> 01:11:46,080
I just said, did you not see me
just trying to carry out my mission.

1168
01:11:46,080 --> 01:11:47,790
- Carrying out your mission?
- That's right.

1169
01:11:47,790 --> 01:11:49,050
I don't think I saw that.

1170
01:11:49,060 --> 01:11:51,050
I'm trying to do my mission,
so don't talk to me anymore.

1171
01:11:51,050 --> 01:11:53,370
- Fine!
- Talk to my lawyer instead!

1172
01:11:53,370 --> 01:11:54,550
What did you say?

1173
01:11:57,820 --> 01:11:59,750
I told you, I don't have it.
So why do you keep doing this to me?

1174
01:11:59,750 --> 01:12:01,160
Why are you changing the
tone of your voice?

1175
01:12:01,160 --> 01:12:02,970
[Toning down right away with
Mr. Capable in front of him?]

1176
01:12:05,210 --> 01:12:08,380
[Where is the flag?]

1177
01:12:08,380 --> 01:12:09,990
There's a flagpole in there.

1178
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:11,630
- You found one?
- Yeah, it's in the gym.

1179
01:12:12,170 --> 01:12:13,470
Soo Ro!

1180
01:12:13,910 --> 01:12:15,230
Soo Ro!

1181
01:12:15,230 --> 01:12:18,080
[Discovers Soo Ro who's the only one
that knows of where the flag is.]

1182
01:12:21,300 --> 01:12:22,890
Why is he running away from us?

1183
01:12:24,050 --> 01:12:26,370
[Seeing how he's running away,
does Soo Ro really have the flag?]

1184

Soo Ro has the flag.

1187

[Surrounded!]

1188
01:12:38,140 --> 01:12:40,090

1189
01:12:44,390 --> 01:12:46,840
[Could that really be the flag?]

1190
01:12:48,510 --> 01:12:51,580
[If that really is the flag,
then the Theater Club is in danger!]

1191
01:12:53,840 --> 01:12:55,290
- It's not me.
- Let us just check.

1192
01:12:55,290 --> 01:12:57,090
- Soo Ro...
- I said, it's not me.

1193
01:12:57,090 --> 01:12:59,190
[Four members of the Athletic Club
surrounding Soo Ro to block him in.]

1194
01:12:59,190 --> 01:13:00,740
- He has it.
- Jong Kook...

1195
01:13:00,740 --> 01:13:02,390
You know that I don't lie.

1196
01:13:04,240 --> 01:13:07,130
[Does he really have the flag
around his waist?]

1197
01:13:07,680 --> 01:13:09,640
That's not the flag.

1198
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:12,630
[It's a fake!
They've been deceived!]

1199
01:13:15,100 --> 01:13:17,500
[Game Adversary fools
all four of them!]

1200
01:13:17,860 --> 01:13:19,900
[This one is a fake!]

1201
01:13:21,410 --> 01:13:24,840
[In that case, who has the real flag?]

1202
01:13:30,970 --> 01:13:32,160

1203

[Big-nosed Brother on his own
in search of the flagpole.]

[Discovers Jong Hyun with
the flag by pure luck!]

1207

Jong Hyun... where's Jong Hyun?

1208
01:13:55,710 --> 01:13:58,750
Where did he go?
We can't have our flag stolen.

1209
01:13:59,370 --> 01:14:01,210
I already checked the fifth floor,
but he wasn't up there.

1210
01:14:02,010 --> 01:14:04,190
Then does that mean he
went downstairs?

1211
01:14:04,770 --> 01:14:08,070
You think he's hiding somewhere?
Didn't you say he's very good at hiding?

1212
01:14:09,060 --> 01:14:11,930
[Hiding? He's actually
being chased right now.]

1213
01:14:11,930 --> 01:14:14,740
The flag!
The flag is up on the fifth floor!

1214
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:17,070

like a flash of lightening!]

1216

that moment to successfully escape.]

Athletic Club!

1220
01:14:38,520 --> 01:14:41,780
How is it that the Theater Club
can run better than the Athletic Club?

1221
01:14:43,560 --> 01:14:45,190
Athletic Club, where are you?

1222
01:14:45,770 --> 01:14:47,460
Hey, Athletic Club!

also in a frenzy searching for Jong Hyun.]

- Have you seen Jong Hyun?

1226

- I saw him.
- Where are you going, Suk Jin?

1227
01:14:57,120 --> 01:14:59,210
<i>- Where are you going?
- Isn't that mine?</i>

1228
01:14:59,210 --> 01:15:01,140
<i>- Huh?
- That looks like mine.</i>

1229
01:15:01,870 --> 01:15:03,330
Where in the world did he go?

1230
01:15:11,480 --> 01:15:13,900
[Finally discovers Jong Hyun!]

1231
01:15:14,440 --> 01:15:15,670
Stay in hiding.

hiding back there.

[Theater Club in an emergency meeting.]

1234
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:25,450
Just be cool... don't make it obvious
because Jong Hyun is back there.

1235
01:15:25,460 --> 01:15:28,930
[Jong Hyun's been found
to be in possession of the flag.]

1236
01:15:28,930 --> 01:15:30,830
- I think we're going to have to switch.
- Woo Bin should take it.

1237
01:15:30,830 --> 01:15:32,350
Woo Bin, you take the flag this time.

1238
01:15:32,710 --> 01:15:36,130
[Theater Club making the switch to Woo Bin
to hold on to the flag?]

1239
01:15:36,130 --> 01:15:37,450

already had many run-ins with the Athletic Club.]

1242
01:15:50,240 --> 01:15:52,260

the other way.

fake the others out.]

[In search for the flag.]

1247
01:16:05,280 --> 01:16:07,720
Should we start searching from
the first floor again?

1248
01:16:07,730 --> 01:16:10,680
Kwang Soo and I'll go up to the
top floor and search down.

1249
01:16:10,680 --> 01:16:11,790
Okay.

1250
01:16:16,260 --> 01:16:20,850
[Is Woo Bin heading over to the flagpole
since he knows where one is?]

1251

- It's over there.

1260

[What do we do?]

1266
01:17:20,970 --> 01:17:22,270
I'm just going to take a quick look.

1267
01:17:22,270 --> 01:17:23,620
Let's take a look inside.

1268

[The flag is caught in a mousetrap.]

1269

on screen in his situation?]

[Makes his escape for now!]

1329
01:21:38,030 --> 01:21:41,260

to fight so desperately...]

[That's the Theater Club's flagpole!]

1342
01:22:48,220 --> 01:22:51,560

make his escape again!]

about giving out hugs today.]

1347
01:23:08,730 --> 01:23:11,200
[Even though he was able to
escape Mr. Capable...]

1348
01:23:12,370 --> 01:23:14,310
[Climbing over a hill to
encounter another hill.]

1349
01:23:14,310 --> 01:23:17,730
[Ace Blank Ji]

1350
01:23:21,780 --> 01:23:24,270
[The flag is back in
Athletic Club's possession!]

1351
01:23:25,610 --> 01:23:26,840
Run!
Run away quickly!

1352
01:23:33,530 --> 01:23:35,420
[Passing it back to Blank Ji?]

1353
01:23:36,760 --> 01:23:39,020

[Back to the auditorium on the second floor
that he saw earlier!]

1359
01:24:03,150 --> 01:24:06,660
[What? Why is he heading to
that pole?]

1360
01:24:08,360 --> 01:24:10,920
[The blue flagpole belongs
to the Theater Club...]

1361
01:24:13,670 --> 01:24:15,060
Hurry up and shut the door.

1362
01:24:16,220 --> 01:24:18,480
[Hm...]

1363
01:24:19,810 --> 01:24:21,510
- Let's protect this with our lives.
- We're going to protect it.

1364
01:24:21,510 --> 01:24:23,110
We have to protect it no matter what!

1365
01:24:23,110 --> 01:24:24,630
No matter what!

1366
01:24:26,640 --> 01:24:29,540

[Tying it up nice and securely
to the other team's flagpole...]

1369
01:24:38,820 --> 01:24:40,520
Use your legs to keep it shut.

1370
01:24:40,950 --> 01:24:43,240
[No one is getting through here!]

1371
01:24:49,200 --> 01:24:51,200
[Running full speed towards the flag!]

1372
01:24:53,410 --> 01:24:56,180
[You can just leave it alone...]

1373
01:24:56,180 --> 01:24:58,920
[Seriously, just leave it alone...]

1374
01:25:00,750 --> 01:25:01,840
Jong Hyun!

1375
01:25:02,540 --> 01:25:05,030
That's the Theater Club pole.
That's our flagpole!

1376
01:25:05,030 --> 01:25:08,460

- Please stop!

to win is dissipated!]

1379
01:25:18,540 --> 01:25:21,980

[Quarterback Soo Ro's surprise pass!]

1381

[Receiver Jong Suk catches the flag!]

1382

He's got him again.

1383
01:25:38,160 --> 01:25:40,260
Stop hugging me!
It's annoying me to death!

1384
01:25:41,580 --> 01:25:44,380

I'll be back with these guys next week...

1390

I have to face them again
next week.

1391
01:26:21,770 --> 01:26:25,020
- You were very aggressive today.
- We saw the glint you had in your eye.

1392
01:26:26,030 --> 01:26:27,400
That wildcat glint in your eye.

1393
