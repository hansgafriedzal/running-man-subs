When I was little...

20
00:01:06,216 --> 00:01:08,358
I was left abandoned in
front of an orphanage.

21
00:01:09,373 --> 00:01:10,987

do for Hye Gyo.

[A really short brother that
doesn't exist in the original show.]

Hye Gyo!

36
00:01:59,038 --> 00:02:01,162
- Mister...
- Why are you calling me Mister?

37
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,279
- I can't find Hye Gyo.
- I'm Oh Soo.

38
00:02:04,898 --> 00:02:06,771
- What?
- What's with the tears?

39
00:02:07,427 --> 00:02:09,633
[Were you peeling some onions
before you came here?]

40

Go wait outside.

45
00:02:27,045 --> 00:02:30,160
- Me? You're asking me to leave?
- Go bring the car around.

46

Why do I need to bring the car around?

47
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:32,833
- Just go!
- I'm Oh Soo!

48
00:02:32,834 --> 00:02:35,156
What are you doing here after I've
generously bought you your coat?

49
00:02:35,157 --> 00:02:36,633
- Are you talking to me?
- I'm talking to the both of you.

50
00:02:36,634 --> 00:02:40,334
[Just because they have long coats on,
they're all pretending to be Oh Soo?]

51

- You're going to go crazy?
- What do you have under that shirt?

52
00:02:44,714 --> 00:02:46,086

that shirt?

- Don't you know this?

55

- You're really tacky, aren't you?
- People like him still exist?

56
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:54,894
You're supposed to wear a shirt underneath.
What is this you've got going on?

57
00:02:56,519 --> 00:02:58,614
[You're caught too.]

58
00:03:01,735 --> 00:03:03,394
- It's my scarf.
- What did you say?

59
00:03:03,395 --> 00:03:04,733
It's my scarf.

60
00:03:04,734 --> 00:03:07,121
[Whenever the Giraffe is around,
the teasing automatically starts.]

61
00:03:07,122 --> 00:03:08,580

63
00:03:13,296 --> 00:03:14,848
<i>Sparta...</i>

64
00:03:15,275 --> 00:03:16,855
Is that someone's bodyguard?

65
00:03:17,343 --> 00:03:20,511
[Judging by the way he looks,
he seems like the head bodyguard...]

66
00:03:20,512 --> 00:03:21,723
What is this?

67
00:03:21,724 --> 00:03:23,473
How is that any way to speak to me?

68
00:03:23,473 --> 00:03:25,399
- What?
- What is he saying?

69
00:03:25,533 --> 00:03:28,734
- What?
- Jong Kook... what kind of acting is that?

70
00:03:28,735 --> 00:03:30,823
- What's wrong with it? That was cool.
- How is that cool?

71
00:03:30,824 --> 00:03:32,409
I'm Oh Soo.

72
00:03:33,083 --> 00:03:34,271
I'm Kwang Soo.

73
00:03:34,999 --> 00:03:36,419
What is this?

74
00:03:38,573 --> 00:03:39,689
What is this?

75
00:03:42,917 --> 00:03:44,967
- You really shouldn't make it so easy.
- You're really...

76
00:03:44,968 --> 00:03:46,175
You really shouldn't make it
so easy for me like that.

77
00:03:46,176 --> 00:03:48,472
You always beat me to it.
I really wanted to do that.

78
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:50,513
- It's all about the timing!
- It's seriously so upsetting!

79
00:03:50,514 --> 00:03:54,368
You have to be a little quicker on your toes.
You always have to be on your toes.

80
00:03:54,886 --> 00:03:57,519
The one who stays on his toes
can pull off more pranks.

81
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:00,258
'The one who stays on his toes
can pull off more pranks.' - Jae Suk

82
00:04:00,259 --> 00:04:02,552
[Pulling off pranks first thing
in the morning.]

83
00:04:02,553 --> 00:04:04,193
He's my butler.

84
00:04:05,161 --> 00:04:07,402
[Butler Big-nose?]

85
00:04:07,403 --> 00:04:08,930
Butler, why did you follow me here?

86
00:04:08,931 --> 00:04:11,594
Why isn't there any space around here
for me to land my plane?

87
00:04:12,132 --> 00:04:15,044
I'm telling you this right now,
but Suk Jin's really awful at improv.

88
00:04:15,808 --> 00:04:17,803
Even though he comes
from a comedic background...

89
00:04:17,804 --> 00:04:20,068
in all the years I've known him...

90
00:04:20,425 --> 00:04:24,499
when it comes to improv and
dialect speech, he's absolutely hopeless.

91
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,317
Who is that walking in?

92
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:35,762
- What is this?
- We don't want to buy anything.

93
00:04:35,762 --> 00:04:37,646
Welcome to my shop.

94
00:04:37,647 --> 00:04:40,469
Gary... you're driving me insane.
I'm really about to lose my mind.

95
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:41,705
Why are we all dressed like this today?

96
00:04:41,706 --> 00:04:46,038

<i>Why don't you start by ordering
yourselves a drink?</i>

100
00:04:51,971 --> 00:04:53,790
- Really?
- I'll take a caramel macchiato.

101
00:04:54,292 --> 00:04:55,674
I'll take your order whenever
you're ready.

102
00:04:55,675 --> 00:04:57,084
Please tell me clearly.

103
00:04:57,085 --> 00:04:59,795
What's this?
Kiwi? I'll take the kiwi juice.

104
00:04:59,796 --> 00:05:01,586
- Kiwi juice.
- Coke.

105
00:05:01,587 --> 00:05:04,225
- Coke?
- I want a carbonated beverage.

106
00:05:04,226 --> 00:05:06,322
- A carbonated beverage?
- I'll take a sparkling water.

107
00:05:06,323 --> 00:05:08,060
- Okay.
- Iced tea for me.

108
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:10,683
I'll take an iced tea as well.

109
00:05:11,088 --> 00:05:12,533
- Iced tea?
- Yes, iced tea.

110
00:05:12,534 --> 00:05:14,133
Yes, I got it.

111
00:05:16,087 --> 00:05:19,680
- But Song Ji Hyo isn't here.
- I'm sure she'll turn up sometime.

112
00:05:20,783 --> 00:05:24,572
- If Ji Hyo's not here today...
- Then we're going to have female guests?

113
00:05:24,573 --> 00:05:27,153
- Since she's not there today...
- You think Song Hye Gyo will be here?

114
00:05:27,154 --> 00:05:29,113
[Full of anticipation]

115
00:05:29,114 --> 00:05:31,748
- Since Sa Yeon was here two weeks ago...
- That's right!

116
00:05:32,803 --> 00:05:34,744
[That's right!
There's no way it could be the Tuna again!]

117
00:05:34,744 --> 00:05:37,757
- You think it could be Bong Sun?
- Ah, there's Bong Sun...

118
00:05:38,859 --> 00:05:40,682
- Bong Sun...
- Or what if it's Kim Sook?

119
00:05:40,683 --> 00:05:43,733
[Could it be either Bong Sun
or Kim Sook?]

120
00:05:45,703 --> 00:05:49,841
[Just which female guests will
make their appearance today?]

121
00:05:55,125 --> 00:05:57,198
This seat next to me was empty earlier.

122
00:05:58,141 --> 00:06:00,167
Don't you think he hit me a little
too hard just now?

123
00:06:00,491 --> 00:06:01,918
When did I ever hit you that hard?

124
00:06:02,297 --> 00:06:03,913
<i>If you're going to switch your seats,
this is your last chance.</i>

125
00:06:03,914 --> 00:06:05,603
In that case, I'll drink the kiwi juice.

126
00:06:05,604 --> 00:06:07,903
- Okay then, go ahead.
- I'm just kidding.

127
00:06:09,475 --> 00:06:11,443
I'll drink the kiwi juice.

128
00:06:11,444 --> 00:06:13,087
[Is Butler Big-nose switching
to the kiwi juice?]

129
00:06:13,949 --> 00:06:18,511
[All the CEO's acting very indecisive
towards the end.]

130
00:06:19,853 --> 00:06:21,743
In that case, I want the kiwi juice too.

131
00:06:25,077 --> 00:06:27,100
[Pondering]

132
00:06:27,597 --> 00:06:29,641

- Kiwi juice.
- I want the cola!

136
00:06:41,738 --> 00:06:43,724
- One!
- I want the kiwi juice.

137

[Fickle hearts of the CEO's.]

140
00:06:54,901 --> 00:06:56,977
- I'm glad I switched.
- You all changed?

141
00:06:59,637 --> 00:07:01,813
[Jae Suk's final decision is
the iced tea.]

142
00:07:03,183 --> 00:07:07,374
[Passing on the ordering information
to the ladies lying in wait.]

143
00:07:07,375 --> 00:07:08,929
Cola, kiwi juice, carbonated beverage,
and iced tea.

144
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:10,398
Yes, you just need to  choose
one of those.

145
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:14,381
[Just which one will they choose?]

146
00:07:16,043 --> 00:07:19,285

- Someone's coming!
- Who is it?

149
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:32,604
- Who is it?
- Whoever it is, I can tell she's pretty!

150
00:07:32,605 --> 00:07:34,185
- She's pretty?
- From what I can see, she's pretty!

151
00:07:34,635 --> 00:07:38,615
[Who's the beautiful young lady
bringing out the iced tea?]

152

- She's so beautiful!
- Wow!

Song Ji Hyo!
Song Ji Hyo!

Why is it this table?

158
00:08:01,968 --> 00:08:03,999
Jae Suk, what is it?
What's wrong with you?

159
00:08:04,509 --> 00:08:07,593
- Jae Suk, you look like you're about to cry.
- But you've always favored Ji Hyo.

160
00:08:08,077 --> 00:08:11,313
- When you were with Sa Yeon...
- I normally favor Ji Hyo.

161
00:08:11,925 --> 00:08:15,680
But today was my chance.
With all the beautiful female guests...

162
00:08:15,681 --> 00:08:17,274
- Are there beautiful guests in the back?
- They are unbelievable.

- Really? They're that pretty?

00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:12,171
[Just which of the two will be caught?]

512
00:25:12,929 --> 00:25:15,453
[Catching up to them
at a lightning fast speed!]

513
00:25:17,465 --> 00:25:19,837
[The Gary and Yeon Hee couple
is eliminated.]

514
00:25:19,838 --> 00:25:21,189
Did you get caught?

515
00:25:21,436 --> 00:25:23,761
[Jong Kook and Ara wins!]

516
00:25:23,762 --> 00:25:26,568
<i>The winner of the 'Rose of Sharon' game is,
Kim Jong Kook and Go Ara.</i>

517
00:25:28,446 --> 00:25:30,472
Is this a makjang drama?

518
00:25:30,473 --> 00:25:35,290
<i>Only the winner couple of this game
will get to see the final scene early.</i>

519
00:25:35,291 --> 00:25:36,995
[The winning couple gets to see
the final scene early?]

520
00:25:36,996 --> 00:25:40,247
<i>You will find a car waiting for you outside,
and the final scene is in that car.</i>

521
00:25:40,248 --> 00:25:43,386
<i>While heading to your next location,
you can check the final scene in the car.</i>

522
00:25:43,387 --> 00:25:44,749
- The final scene?
- It's the final scene.

523
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:46,237
Don't you think that's too big
of an advantage?

524
00:25:46,362 --> 00:25:50,408
<i>Also, only the couple that won can go on
to the next destination in the car.</i>

525
00:25:50,409 --> 00:25:52,056
<i>As for the rest of the members...</i>

526
00:25:52,057 --> 00:25:54,828
<i>the men and women will go separately
to your next destination.</i>

527
00:25:55,910 --> 00:25:58,838
- Okay, I understand.
- This is what we wanted.

528
00:25:58,839 --> 00:26:02,279
What does that mean?
Ji Hyo and I are finally getting along!

529
00:26:02,550 --> 00:26:05,607
- We're finally on the same page!
- We're just learning how to work together.

530
00:26:07,717 --> 00:26:09,553
We're going to head out first then.

531
00:26:09,554 --> 00:26:11,365
- We're going to head out first.
- We'll see you later.

532
00:26:11,366 --> 00:26:12,945
- Okay, see you there.
- See you later.

533
00:26:12,946 --> 00:26:14,492
We're going to go in our car.

534
00:26:16,038 --> 00:26:17,220
See you later.

535
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:19,522
[On to the second location.]

536
00:26:19,523 --> 00:26:21,407
We'll see you at the next scene.

537
00:26:22,404 --> 00:26:24,248
I'll see you at the next location.

538
00:26:25,506 --> 00:26:27,388
That's not entertaining.

539
00:26:29,096 --> 00:26:32,925
[We'll see you at the next location!]

540
00:26:38,183 --> 00:26:41,057
[What are you doing?]

541
00:26:41,595 --> 00:26:43,123
What are you doing?

542
00:26:44,282 --> 00:26:46,129
There are some lines that just
shouldn't be crossed.

543
00:26:46,130 --> 00:26:48,151
- You're the only one who can do it?
- Come here!

544
00:26:48,152 --> 00:26:49,978
<i>We'll go with yours, Jae Suk.</i>

545
00:26:49,979 --> 00:26:51,337
- Yes, I understand.
- Use mine too.

546
00:26:51,338 --> 00:26:52,833
Thank you.

547
00:26:54,882 --> 00:26:56,752
<i>Hit the slate in an
entertaining way for us.</i>

548
00:26:59,924 --> 00:27:02,118
[In the most entertaining ways.]

549
00:27:04,612 --> 00:27:07,652
You can't hit the slate like that!
How is that entertaining?

550
00:27:07,652 --> 00:27:09,215
- Try to make it funny.
- You don't think that was funny?

551
00:27:09,216 --> 00:27:10,477
Seriously!

552
00:27:10,478 --> 00:27:12,233
[This is how you do it.]

553
00:27:13,201 --> 00:27:15,095
[The correct way to hit the slate.]

554
00:27:16,229 --> 00:27:17,510
Come on, seriously!

555
00:27:18,388 --> 00:27:22,025
- As always...
- You don't even know the basics.

556
00:27:22,026 --> 00:27:24,744
This much should be a given.
These guys don't even know that.

557
00:27:26,072 --> 00:27:27,689
See?
They're going to use mine again.

558
00:27:30,052 --> 00:27:34,311
[See you soon at the second scene.]

559
00:27:37,745 --> 00:27:41,409
[Jong Kook and Ara heading out
together to the second location.]

560
00:27:41,409 --> 00:27:43,900
Is that nice imported car for us?

561
00:27:46,454 --> 00:27:47,686
Seriously...

562
00:27:49,611 --> 00:27:50,866
- What's that?
- What is that?

563
00:27:51,244 --> 00:27:52,836
You guys are riding in that car?

564
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:56,148
[Unhappy with the difference
in their rides.]

565
00:27:56,149 --> 00:27:57,998
Why?
Why can't we ride in this?

566
00:27:57,999 --> 00:27:59,216
What's wrong with you guys?

567
00:28:00,197 --> 00:28:02,450
What goes around, comes around.

568
00:28:03,099 --> 00:28:04,540
- Should we take a look?
- Yes.

569
00:28:04,541 --> 00:28:07,446
[The final scene that only the
winning couple can see.]

570
00:28:08,428 --> 00:28:13,695
[A box?]

571
00:28:15,092 --> 00:28:20,731
[A man and a woman holding the box together
in front of the house on the next page.]

572
00:28:21,619 --> 00:28:22,797
I think...

573
00:28:24,611 --> 00:28:25,877
since this is the final scene
we're looking at...

574
00:28:25,878 --> 00:28:32,342
[Jong Kook's guess is that the ending is of
a couple walking away with a treasure?]

575
00:28:32,342 --> 00:28:33,688
They're being given a treasure!

576
00:28:35,417 --> 00:28:38,975
I think this is what's going to happen.
Let's take a closer look.

577
00:28:38,976 --> 00:28:41,363
I'm sure there must be a reason why
there's a close-up of this box.

578
00:28:41,364 --> 00:28:47,069
[Is this box something they're going to
have to find later on?]

579
00:28:47,527 --> 00:28:50,220
[Jong Kook and Ara who have an
advantage over the other couples.]

580
00:28:50,221 --> 00:28:53,126
Let's do our best and win today.

581
00:28:56,625 --> 00:28:58,979
What is this?
This car smells like men.

582
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:01,023
[The men's car stinking of male scent.]

583
00:29:02,458 --> 00:29:07,536
[All the members are to come to SBS gym
where the second scene will take place.]

584
00:29:07,537 --> 00:29:09,397
Let's just get there quickly in silence.

585
00:29:11,634 --> 00:29:13,260
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

586
00:29:13,931 --> 00:29:19,002
This is my first time driving with a girl
since I've been on Running Man.

587
00:29:20,285 --> 00:29:22,536
You can use casual speech with me, Ji Hyo.

588
00:29:24,042 --> 00:29:25,745
Yes... okay.

589
00:29:25,746 --> 00:29:30,860
I really didn't think you were going to
come to China back then.

590
00:29:31,388 --> 00:29:36,582
[Having been totally shocked at
Ji Hyo's surprise appearance.]

591
00:29:36,582 --> 00:29:38,830
I kept suspecting Jong Kook.

592
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:42,979
I really... want to rip it off.

593
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:44,837
I really want to rip someone's
name tag off this time.

594
00:29:44,838 --> 00:29:46,812
You didn't get to rip off anyone's
name tag off the last time?

595
00:29:46,813 --> 00:29:48,765
- No, I didn't.
- Really?

596
00:29:48,766 --> 00:29:50,284
I didn't get to rip it off even once.

597
00:29:50,285 --> 00:29:53,888
No matter who wins today, my goal
is to rip off someone's name tag today.

598
00:29:53,889 --> 00:29:56,168
- I really want to rip it off.
- Who's name tag do you want to rip off?

599
00:29:57,112 --> 00:30:00,472
- I really want to get Jong Kook.
- Jong Kook?

600
00:30:00,473 --> 00:30:02,798
I want to rip his name tag off
the moment we start the race.

601
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:04,015
Really?

602
00:30:04,016 --> 00:30:05,554
Since he's so impossible for
anyone to eliminate.

603
00:30:06,016 --> 00:30:08,847
[I will rip off Mr. Capable's name tag!]

604
00:30:10,323 --> 00:30:12,139
<i>Okay, come on in.</i>

605
00:30:13,844 --> 00:30:16,915
[Jong Kook and Ara couple enter
hand in hand.]

606
00:30:17,265 --> 00:30:20,852
This looks like what I used to have to do
when I was on the show, X-Man.

607
00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:22,958
What is this?

608
00:30:22,959 --> 00:30:25,246
[The rest of the members also arrive.]

609
00:30:25,247 --> 00:30:26,984
<i>Lee Yeon Hee, please step forward.</i>

610
00:30:29,605 --> 00:30:31,352
You look beautiful even from the back.

611
00:30:32,076 --> 00:30:34,552
[Gary's just happy to be
Yeon Hee's partner.]

612
00:30:34,553 --> 00:30:37,162
Part two, 'R' Group athletic competition.

613
00:30:37,163 --> 00:30:40,258
The two people who are having
a secret affair

614
00:30:40,259 --> 00:30:43,879
test their feelings for one another by
playing a round of 'Couple's Dodgeball.'

615
00:30:44,274 --> 00:30:47,024
But a sudden terminal illness
comes to find the couple...

616
00:30:47,025 --> 00:30:49,486
[Terminal illness?]

617
00:30:49,487 --> 00:30:51,683
But a sudden terminal illness
comes to find the couple...

618
00:30:51,684 --> 00:30:54,060
The woman faints after being
hit by the ball.

619
00:30:54,061 --> 00:30:55,381
This is starting to turn into
a makjang drama.

620
00:30:55,382 --> 00:30:58,832
The CEO who tries to block all the throws
with his own body to protect her...

621
00:30:59,423 --> 00:31:01,341
Winning the game of dodgeball
is the only way

622
00:31:01,341 --> 00:31:04,445
of getting the approval
from his father, the chairman.

623
00:31:05,672 --> 00:31:07,972
The woman must be hit by the ball
for the couple to be ousted.

624
00:31:07,972 --> 00:31:09,138
The remaining couple wins.

625
00:31:09,138 --> 00:31:13,178
- The woman has to be hit to be ousted?
- These two are going to be fun to watch.

626
00:31:13,179 --> 00:31:17,648
<i>So in order to help you out in your
search for your destined partner...</i>

627
00:31:18,111 --> 00:31:20,992
<i>we're going to play this game by
switching the partners around.</i>

628
00:31:22,477 --> 00:31:24,089
[Partner switch up]

629
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:26,969
- Great!
- What do you mean, great?

630
00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:28,716
What are you saying?

631
00:31:29,619 --> 00:31:31,889
[Partner switch up confusing everyone.]

632
00:31:32,421 --> 00:31:34,470
Is there really a reason
for us to be doing this?

633
00:31:34,471 --> 00:31:37,197
<i>The reason being, you know
this is a Running Mini-series...</i>

634
00:31:37,198 --> 00:31:39,595
<i>and in every drama,
there's always a climatic issue.</i>

635
00:31:39,596 --> 00:31:41,333
I really like climatic issues.

636
00:31:41,334 --> 00:31:43,660
Can't you do this in the
morning drama style?

637
00:31:45,081 --> 00:31:46,592
Chance!

638
00:31:47,498 --> 00:31:52,134
<i>This time, the ladies will have the chance
to choose their partners themselves.</i>

639
00:31:52,135 --> 00:31:55,356
<i>They can do this by going up to the person
they want, and giving them a back hug.</i>

640
00:31:56,329 --> 00:31:58,417
<i>A back hug...</i>

641
00:31:59,044 --> 00:32:03,331
<i>That's how we'll choose the partners.
Ladies, please take a step back.</i>

642
00:32:03,332 --> 00:32:05,696
Then this is random.

643
00:32:05,697 --> 00:32:08,075
This is seriously driving me nuts.

644
00:32:09,946 --> 00:32:11,351
This is seriously...

645
00:32:13,002 --> 00:32:17,075
[Who will be the new couples to be
born out of this round?]

646
00:32:17,076 --> 00:32:18,737
<i>Until you are told,
you can't turn around.</i>

647
00:32:18,738 --> 00:32:20,519
- I understand.
- I'll keep my eyes closed.

648
00:32:21,499 --> 00:32:23,052
Let's just be cool about this.

649
00:32:23,053 --> 00:32:25,433
[The first candy girl, Lee Yeon Hee.]

650
00:32:25,535 --> 00:32:27,423
[Who will she select?]

651
00:32:29,653 --> 00:32:32,487
- I can hear someone's footsteps.
- The sound of those footsteps...

652
00:32:32,488 --> 00:32:34,703
- It's giving me hope.
- The footsteps are going further away.

653
00:32:36,333 --> 00:32:38,569
[Yeon Hee can't easily make up her mind.]

654
00:32:38,570 --> 00:32:41,269
I can hear her... there she is.
She's right here.

655
00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:43,841
[Where will she go?]

656
00:32:54,688 --> 00:32:56,729
[She chooses CEO Gae again!]

657
00:32:58,313 --> 00:32:59,815
Ji Hyo.
I'm positive it's Ji Hyo.

658
00:32:59,816 --> 00:33:01,061
Is it Ji Hyo?

659
00:33:02,161 --> 00:33:04,397
[Now it's Blank Ji's turn.]

660
00:33:11,782 --> 00:33:13,297
[Blank Ji teasing all the CEO's.]

661
00:33:13,541 --> 00:33:14,655
Is she behind me?

662
00:33:20,895 --> 00:33:23,680
- I'm going crazy! Stop teasing me!
- What's going on?

663
00:33:23,681 --> 00:33:25,021
Why are you making all that noise?

664
00:33:26,623 --> 00:33:28,285
- I'm getting nervous.
- I feel like I'm going to go crazy.

665
00:33:28,286 --> 00:33:31,432
Hey... I can smell someone's perfume.
I can smell someone's perfume.

666
00:33:31,432 --> 00:33:33,988
[Blank Ji selects CEO Ha.]

667
00:33:34,711 --> 00:33:36,365
That smelled like Ji Hyo's perfume.

668
00:33:37,131 --> 00:33:39,055
All I can smell is Jong Kook's cologne.

669
00:33:39,056 --> 00:33:41,144
- Okay, keep your eyes closed.
- This is the last one.

670
00:33:41,145 --> 00:33:42,425
The last one.
This is the last one.

671
00:33:42,814 --> 00:33:44,334
Honey!

672
00:33:44,335 --> 00:33:46,721
[The last candy girl, Ara.]

673
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:50,889
[Runs full speed ahead
without any hesitation.]

674
00:33:50,890 --> 00:33:52,830
- I'm right here!
- Honey!

675
00:34:04,121 --> 00:34:05,885
[A fierce back hug!]

676
00:34:06,681 --> 00:34:08,732
[Is it even a surprise?
Ara chooses CEO Kkuk again.]

677
00:34:11,332 --> 00:34:12,417
<i>You may turn around.</i>

678
00:34:16,465 --> 00:34:21,283
[The two ecstatic couples and...]

679
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:29,237
[And the remaining three who weren't
able to become a part of a couple.]

680
00:34:29,238 --> 00:34:30,759
I'm stuck in this situation again?

681
00:34:33,491 --> 00:34:36,226
- What are we supposed to do now?
- Miss Blank. Don't you think that was rude?

682
00:34:36,983 --> 00:34:39,209
I have my right to choose!

683
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:42,449
The situation I'm in...
I can't be too happy about this either...

684
00:34:43,327 --> 00:34:46,540
- This is just unbelievable.
- Ji Hyo!

685
00:34:46,541 --> 00:34:50,559
A true candy girl does not
betray her partner.

686
00:34:51,743 --> 00:34:54,434
- Seriously... as predicted...
- As predicted...

687
00:34:54,435 --> 00:34:57,056
<i>The three of you need to choose which
two are going to become a couple.</i>

688
00:34:57,756 --> 00:35:00,409
Again? Are we going to be
doing this all day?

689
00:35:00,410 --> 00:35:01,478
[We have to play another couple game...]

690
00:35:01,721 --> 00:35:03,602
Hey, I like you!

691
00:35:04,087 --> 00:35:06,171
- I like you!
- Hang on a second.

692
00:35:06,172 --> 00:35:07,727
Hey, I like you!

693
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:11,173
[Fascinating couple]

694
00:35:11,913 --> 00:35:13,064
Doesn't Kwang Soo and Suk Jin
look like a couple?

695
00:35:13,065 --> 00:35:14,445
They totally look like a couple.

696
00:35:14,446 --> 00:35:17,467
- Jae Suk, I don't think you...
- What are you talking about?

697
00:35:17,467 --> 00:35:19,004
Kwang Soo and I are a couple.

698
00:35:19,005 --> 00:35:23,337
[Huh? He and Kwang Soo
are a couple?]

699
00:35:26,544 --> 00:35:28,543
[Awesome]

700
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,855
- Uee!
- I miss you!

701
00:35:35,323 --> 00:35:38,117
- He's right! Those two really are a couple.
- Over... the selection is over.

702
00:35:39,998 --> 00:35:42,987
[The older hunter being thrown
out to the curb once again.]

703
00:35:42,988 --> 00:35:45,813
- Forget it.
- Uee, I miss you!

704
00:35:47,489 --> 00:35:49,648
What the heck is this?
It's been like this all day!

705
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:53,740
[I'm the lone couple hunter.]

706
00:35:55,241 --> 00:35:57,295
<i>Don't be disappointed that
you're not part of a couple.</i>

707
00:35:57,296 --> 00:35:59,586
- We have a good role for you to play.
- What is it?

708
00:35:59,587 --> 00:36:03,126
<i>Two couples are going to partner up together
to play against the other two couples.</i>

709
00:36:03,127 --> 00:36:06,095
<i>And Ji Suk Jin,
who is not part of a couple...</i>

710
00:36:06,096 --> 00:36:09,040
<i>since the ball may go
out of bounds...</i>

711
00:36:09,041 --> 00:36:11,876
[Wait, that means...]

712
00:36:11,877 --> 00:36:13,444
He's the ball boy?

713
00:36:13,627 --> 00:36:16,630
<i>It's a role that will get you
on camera quite a bit.</i>

714
00:36:17,351 --> 00:36:19,430
So what you're saying right now is,
you want me to be the ball boy?

715
00:36:19,431 --> 00:36:21,452
Why are you trying to
turn it around?

716
00:36:22,211 --> 00:36:24,465
[Big-nosed brother explodes.]

717
00:36:24,938 --> 00:36:26,205
He's asking why they're
changing the story.

718
00:36:26,206 --> 00:36:29,437
My family thinks I left this morning to film
Running Man but I'm here to be the ball boy?

719
00:36:30,929 --> 00:36:34,395
[Anyway...]

720
00:36:34,396 --> 00:36:36,871
[Part two: Dodgeball park.
That Winter, That Typhoon Blows.]

721
00:36:40,917 --> 00:36:43,255
Go all the way to the end.
To the end.

722
00:36:43,256 --> 00:36:44,447
Go all the way to the end.

723
00:36:45,916 --> 00:36:49,372
[Rule: If the woman of your team is hit,
then that team is out.]

724
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:51,346
You got that?
You have to protect me.

725
00:36:51,347 --> 00:36:52,976
- Who's the woman on your team?
- Me.

726
00:36:52,977 --> 00:36:53,996
Really?

727
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:56,833
This is the innocent style.

728
00:36:58,433 --> 00:37:00,410
But still a woman with taste.

729
00:37:01,530 --> 00:37:04,318
- You're attractive.
- You're very attractive.

730
00:37:04,319 --> 00:37:05,979
[This generation's ideal woman, Jae Soon.]

731
00:37:06,583 --> 00:37:08,366
[Time to decide who will go first.]

732
00:37:08,367 --> 00:37:09,514
[Mister hunter guy]

733
00:37:09,515 --> 00:37:11,240
[The judge will be the Mister Hunter.]

734
00:37:11,241 --> 00:37:14,952
- I'm just going to run in there.
- Get in there and get it.

735
00:37:14,953 --> 00:37:17,003
- We have to get in there and get the ball.
- Let's really do this.

736
00:37:17,004 --> 00:37:19,400
I'm going to block them off,
so you grab the ball, okay?

737
00:37:19,401 --> 00:37:21,225
You're going to rip your pants again
if you're not careful.

738
00:37:21,225 --> 00:37:22,374
I'm going to block them all off.

739
00:37:37,008 --> 00:37:39,765
[Unguarded!]

740
00:37:40,486 --> 00:37:43,412
[An opportunity as soon as
the game starts!]

741
00:37:45,089 --> 00:37:47,562
What are you doing?
Hey, what are you doing?

742
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,580
[The lightning fast protective instinct
that Gary's showing the team.]

743
00:37:54,217 --> 00:37:55,713
[Trustworthy Gary-guard.]

744
00:38:01,658 --> 00:38:03,069
[Mr. Capable's fierce attack
they were just able to evade.]

745
00:38:03,070 --> 00:38:04,854
- This is a ferocious game.
- Over here!

746
00:38:05,770 --> 00:38:07,853
[In danger again!]

747
00:38:09,732 --> 00:38:11,526
[Barely escapes it again.]

748
00:38:12,812 --> 00:38:14,728
Please just stay behind me!

749
00:38:19,454 --> 00:38:21,332
[Finally gets the chance to attack!]

750
00:38:22,498 --> 00:38:23,909
[A game reversal!]

751
00:38:29,376 --> 00:38:31,422
[Bulls eye!]

752
00:38:35,702 --> 00:38:37,918
[Blocks with his whole body
twice in a row!]

753
00:38:43,542 --> 00:38:45,338
[Giraffe's sacrifice.]

754
00:38:47,948 --> 00:38:49,602
[The ball goes back to the other team.]

755
00:38:55,275 --> 00:38:57,394
[Fierce]

756
00:38:57,690 --> 00:39:00,104
- What the heck, lady?
- Can a girl do that?

757
00:39:00,902 --> 00:39:03,400
- I've been working out a bit, what!
- Can the girl do that?

758
00:39:04,384 --> 00:39:06,724
[Athletic Jae Soon's fierce attack.]

759
00:39:07,732 --> 00:39:10,204
Is that really a girl?
Look at the way she's standing!

760
00:39:13,725 --> 00:39:16,455
[Huh?]

761
00:39:18,756 --> 00:39:20,806
[Giraffe and Jae Soon's combo attack!]

762
00:39:21,238 --> 00:39:22,950
[Save us]

763
00:39:27,741 --> 00:39:29,859
[Superpower fireworks show?]

764
00:39:29,859 --> 00:39:31,638
[Huh?]

765
00:39:33,167 --> 00:39:35,277
[Danger]

766
00:39:36,449 --> 00:39:38,640
[But he blocks it...]

767
00:39:39,035 --> 00:39:40,604
[Blocks his head again...]

768
00:39:44,312 --> 00:39:46,957
[Jae Soon and Giraffe barely
escapes their elimination.]

769
00:39:49,788 --> 00:39:53,612
[Gary has a chance!]

770
00:39:56,599 --> 00:39:58,664
[Jae Soon and Giraffe - Out!]

771
00:39:59,493 --> 00:40:01,740
- You should've blocked it!
- You should've blocked the ball!

772
00:40:01,741 --> 00:40:03,110
Wait, I tried my best!

773
00:40:04,398 --> 00:40:07,136
[Kwang Soo and Jae Suk to
step out of the bounds.]

774
00:40:07,137 --> 00:40:08,434
- This is too funny.
- This way?

775
00:40:08,435 --> 00:40:09,858
We have to stand over here?

776
00:40:13,027 --> 00:40:15,571
[But they're still able to keep participating
in the game from outside the lines.]

777
00:40:15,572 --> 00:40:17,411
We can play from out here,
and we can still win this together.

778
00:40:17,411 --> 00:40:19,038
[There's still a chance.]

779
00:40:19,039 --> 00:40:20,082
Fighting!

780
00:40:20,117 --> 00:40:22,826
[Their plan is to pass the ball
back and forth quickly.]

781
00:40:28,305 --> 00:40:30,065
[Kkuk has his chance!]

782
00:40:33,687 --> 00:40:35,221
This is a tight game.

783
00:40:35,753 --> 00:40:39,032
[If anything, the game has become
more thrilling with one team being ousted.]

784
00:40:41,283 --> 00:40:43,137
[Her legs are left unguarded?]

785
00:40:44,867 --> 00:40:46,787
[Haroro barely gets the ball away
with the tips of his fingers.]

786
00:40:47,283 --> 00:40:50,419
[What?]

787
00:40:51,027 --> 00:40:53,729
[Please give me the ball!]

788
00:40:55,075 --> 00:40:57,532
[Who gets the ball is up
to Mister Hunter.]

789
00:41:02,785 --> 00:41:06,788
You've still got it, Impala!
You've still got it, Impala!

790
00:41:08,453 --> 00:41:10,472
- Your expression was nice.
- Thank you!

791
00:41:11,072 --> 00:41:12,770
[Mr. Gary wins the ball.]

792
00:41:13,676 --> 00:41:14,785
[This is nice.]

793
00:41:16,348 --> 00:41:18,927
[CEO Kkuk not leaving any
open spots for an attack.]

794
00:41:23,108 --> 00:41:24,834
[The attack barely misses.]

795
00:41:27,606 --> 00:41:29,082
This game is fun.

796
00:41:30,558 --> 00:41:32,506
[Escapes it again!]

797
00:41:32,507 --> 00:41:34,725
[Blocks it with his thighs!]

798
00:41:35,586 --> 00:41:37,383
[If it goes that way...]

799
00:41:39,986 --> 00:41:42,170
[Is it the candy girls' turn to cheer?]

800
00:41:42,171 --> 00:41:43,749
You've still got it, Ji Suk Jin!

801
00:41:46,511 --> 00:41:48,350
So cute!
They're so cute!

802
00:41:49,296 --> 00:41:50,939
Give it to the last one!

803
00:41:51,804 --> 00:41:56,057
[Jae Soon's dirty dancing.]

804
00:41:56,812 --> 00:41:58,969
[Her dancing skills bringing out
the ferociousness in others.]

805
00:42:05,028 --> 00:42:06,540
[Give it to me!]

806
00:42:07,348 --> 00:42:09,536
[The woman who doesn't know the
meaning of giving up.]

807
00:42:09,536 --> 00:42:10,700
Get away from me!

808
00:42:13,066 --> 00:42:14,569
Okay, Ara!

809
00:42:14,570 --> 00:42:15,902
[The ball goes to Ara!]

810
00:42:18,977 --> 00:42:20,445
I like this role.

811
00:42:20,446 --> 00:42:21,864
This isn't bad at all.

812
00:42:22,808 --> 00:42:25,652
[Kkuk and the Giraffe concentrating
their attack on Guard Gary.]

813
00:42:27,947 --> 00:42:30,648
[Yeon Hee grabs the ball!]

814
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:36,288
[Nice throw!]

815
00:42:37,594 --> 00:42:38,740
Good job!

816
00:42:38,741 --> 00:42:40,505
How did she throw it like that?

817
00:42:41,148 --> 00:42:43,486
- Yeon Hee's no joke.
- She's good.

818
00:42:49,631 --> 00:42:52,390
[An emotion-filled attack?]

819
00:42:56,420 --> 00:42:58,293
[A concentrated attack!]

820
00:43:05,930 --> 00:43:08,076
[He grabbed the ball!]

821
00:43:08,554 --> 00:43:09,934
[Mommy!]

822
00:43:10,638 --> 00:43:13,458
[The rage-o-meter is through the roof!]

823
00:43:13,459 --> 00:43:15,559
Jong Kook, calm down!

824
00:43:21,964 --> 00:43:23,520
You can do this!

825
00:43:23,521 --> 00:43:25,253
[Haroro, you scoundrel...]

826
00:43:32,223 --> 00:43:34,038
[The ball flew by like a
bolt of lightning!]

827
00:43:39,382 --> 00:43:41,327
[A ferocious revenge by
the enraged tiger.]

828
00:43:43,117 --> 00:43:44,934
Why did you have to lose the ball?

829
00:43:45,710 --> 00:43:48,143
[Another bulls eye!]

830
00:43:48,564 --> 00:43:49,829
[Please save me!]

831
00:43:59,836 --> 00:44:01,769
Hang on a second.

832
00:44:07,399 --> 00:44:09,412
Is it the fireworks show?

833
00:44:10,212 --> 00:44:12,555
[Been waiting for this moment...]

834
00:44:12,556 --> 00:44:14,344
[Huh?]

835
00:44:18,456 --> 00:44:20,808
[Jae Suk not interested
in the fireworks show.]

836
00:44:22,024 --> 00:44:24,032
We have to oust them quickly.

837
00:44:25,832 --> 00:44:28,035
[The nervous energy is back in the game.]

838
00:44:29,059 --> 00:44:30,360
We have to oust someone.

839
00:44:32,215 --> 00:44:34,302
[Gary's lightning fast deflect!]

840
00:44:35,428 --> 00:44:36,949
[Another immediate attack!]

841
00:44:36,950 --> 00:44:38,292
[This one is blocked too!]

842
00:44:38,946 --> 00:44:41,096
[Gary guard barely blocking
the ball with his hands.]

843
00:44:42,409 --> 00:44:44,892
[But just then!]

844
00:44:47,128 --> 00:44:49,607
[Blank Ji is in danger!]

845
00:44:50,284 --> 00:44:53,241
[Blank Ji is left unguarded.]

846
00:44:59,216 --> 00:45:01,122
[Ha Ha and Blank Ji, out!]

847
00:45:06,804 --> 00:45:08,584
This is actually better.

848
00:45:08,585 --> 00:45:09,670
[The game isn't over yet.]

849
00:45:09,705 --> 00:45:10,773
This is more even.

850

851
00:45:14,342 --> 00:45:16,867

passing the ball back and forth.]

852

00:45:26,985 --> 00:45:28,444
[Immediate danger]

854
00:45:29,164 --> 00:45:31,482
[The impassible Kkuk!]

855
00:45:33,825 --> 00:45:35,866
[Huh?]

856
00:45:38,251 --> 00:45:40,664
[Whenever the ball is in Big-nose's hand,
everyone automatically starts to dance.]

857
00:45:41,005 --> 00:45:43,647
[Ara breaks out into the
Impala song too!]

858
00:45:46,949 --> 00:45:49,065
[Throwing in some footwork?]

859
00:45:53,382 --> 00:45:55,209

[She's hit... what?]

864
00:46:11,891 --> 00:46:13,836
[She catches the fierce throw?]

865
00:46:19,207 --> 00:46:20,775
[This is Yeon Hee's shocking
dodgeball skills!]

866
00:46:20,776 --> 00:46:22,528
- What the heck was that?
- Unbelievable!

867
00:46:25,453 --> 00:46:28,474
[The goddess of dodgeball is born!]

868
00:46:33,274 --> 00:46:35,173
[Huh?]

869
00:46:36,457 --> 00:46:38,140
[The originator of clumsiness, Blank Ji.]

870
00:46:38,141 --> 00:46:39,695
What the heck is that?

871
00:46:41,764 --> 00:46:43,721
[One track mind for the ball.]

872
00:46:43,722 --> 00:46:45,359
You can't come inside the lines.

873
00:46:46,268 --> 00:46:48,454
I only saw the ball.
I'm sorry.

874
00:46:50,642 --> 00:46:52,120
[Kkuk's fast play.]

875
00:46:55,229 --> 00:46:56,974
[Danger]

876
00:46:59,301 --> 00:47:00,616
[Misses his attack!]

877
00:47:01,344 --> 00:47:03,438
[A non-stop attack!]

878
00:47:05,496 --> 00:47:07,677
[What?]

879
00:47:07,677 --> 00:47:09,701
[Yeon Hee's in danger!]

880
00:47:11,590 --> 00:47:14,319
[Of all people for the ball to go to,
why did it have to be the Giraffe?]

881
00:47:19,292 --> 00:47:21,199
[Yeon Hee, out!]

882
00:47:23,602 --> 00:47:26,729
[Jong Kook, Ara and Kwang Soo, Jae Suk wins!]

883

[The goddess of dodge ball
seemingly disappointed.]

885
00:47:37,630 --> 00:47:38,830
That couldn't be helped.

886
00:47:40,629 --> 00:47:42,862
[Immediately moving off to play-offs:
Jong Kook and Ara vs. Kwang Soo and Jae Suk.]

887
00:47:44,172 --> 00:47:45,501
Kwang Soon!

888
00:47:46,570 --> 00:47:47,726
Yes, Honey.

889
00:47:47,727 --> 00:47:49,711
Don't worry about a thing, Kwang Soon.

890
00:47:50,098 --> 00:47:52,533
Just believe in me!

891
00:47:52,534 --> 00:47:54,506
<i>This is the play-offs.</i>

892
00:47:54,507 --> 00:47:55,682

Everyone please stay within the lines.

896
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:07,439
- My girlfriend is so tall...
- I can't get fully concealed.

897
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:09,201
[Miss Kwang Soon unable to fully conceal
her tall body.]

898
00:48:09,202 --> 00:48:11,256
My girlfriend might take a hit
on her head.

899
00:48:12,192 --> 00:48:15,966
[Time to decide who'll go first.]

900
00:48:18,196 --> 00:48:20,148
[Extremely fast Kwang Soon.]

901
00:48:22,682 --> 00:48:25,161

over dodgeball.]

902

- I'm overly excited!
- You can throw the ball.

903

[Save me.]

908

[Dance time?]

909
00:48:54,046 --> 00:48:56,918
[Zebra couple's dance shake.]

910
00:49:05,817 --> 00:49:08,153
[Full of nervous energy even though
the ball hasn't even been thrown out.]

911
00:49:15,386 --> 00:49:16,764
Jae Suk!
Grab the ball!

912
00:49:17,450 --> 00:49:20,547
[Danger]

at avoiding the ball.

916

[Blocks it with his face.]

917
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:37,748
[Unable to control himself
whenever the ball is in sight.]

918
00:49:37,749 --> 00:49:39,334

919
00:49:40,538 --> 00:49:42,448
[The giant girlfriend with fast throws.]

920
00:49:42,449 --> 00:49:43,858
Get the ball back, quick!

921
00:49:44,052 --> 00:49:46,000
[Huh?]

922
00:49:46,001 --> 00:49:47,732
Why is your girlfriend so
good at the game?

923
00:49:48,281 --> 00:49:50,004
[Kwang Soo loses it.]

924
00:49:52,813 --> 00:49:54,150
[A hit to the face]

925

going to come!

I knew a day like this was
going to come!

927
00:50:00,914 --> 00:50:02,682
I knew a day like this was
going to come!

928

[Overtly excited Kwang Soon
causes trouble.]

929
00:50:06,104 --> 00:50:08,277
Jong Kook, that's a girl for now.
You can't do anything about it.

930
00:50:10,864 --> 00:50:12,465
You have to be more understanding
as the man.

931
00:50:12,466 --> 00:50:14,988
Let me go.
I got it.

932
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:18,832
- This is unbelievable.
- That really is unbelievable.

933
00:50:21,648 --> 00:50:23,900
I know that really hurts.
I know it does.

934
00:50:24,435 --> 00:50:26,805
My girlfriend is acting like this because
she's excited to be outside.

935
00:50:27,469 --> 00:50:28,892
- It's just been so long.
- Seriously...

936
00:50:28,893 --> 00:50:30,531
This is the first time I've been
outside since the age of two.

937
00:50:30,532 --> 00:50:32,261
[Kwang Soon's first time
outside since the age of two.]

938
00:50:32,262 --> 00:50:35,092
- She's just so happy to be out.
- I've been caged up inside.

939
00:50:37,465 --> 00:50:38,678
What to do...

940
00:50:40,165 --> 00:50:42,510
I'm going to break up with her
at the end of the week.

941
00:50:42,511 --> 00:50:43,619
[Suddenly declaring his intentions
of a breakup?]

942
00:50:43,620 --> 00:50:44,911
How can you say that?

943
00:50:44,912 --> 00:50:47,752
- This is the last week for us.
- I've bought you everything you wanted!

944
00:50:47,753 --> 00:50:49,602

- I'm going to.

946
00:50:51,252 --> 00:50:53,194
[Back to the game.]

947
00:50:59,828 --> 00:51:01,882
[You just wait and see...]

948
00:51:04,540 --> 00:51:06,063
Stand up.
Don't try to hide.

949
00:51:07,628 --> 00:51:09,048
Stand up.
Don't try to hide.

950
00:51:13,404 --> 00:51:16,170
[While they're too busy cowering,
the ball is quickly passed!]

951
00:51:20,273 --> 00:51:21,492
[A direct hit on Kwang Soon!]

952
00:51:22,309 --> 00:51:24,300
[The quick pass succeeds!]

953

[Jong Kook and Ara wins!]

954
00:51:31,009 --> 00:51:32,381

<i>Kim Jong Kook and Go Ara will be given an
advantage from having won this game.</i>

956

[Part three to immediately start.]

958
00:51:48,026 --> 00:51:49,482
[We won!]

959
00:51:51,312 --> 00:51:53,042
We won all thanks to you.

960
00:51:53,043 --> 00:51:54,596
[Jong Kook and Ara couple happy
to have won again.]

961
00:51:54,597 --> 00:51:57,106
We got something again.

962
00:51:57,107 --> 00:51:58,712
[What advantage have they
won this time?]

963
00:51:58,712 --> 00:52:00,672
- We've got something.
- Let's take a look.

964
00:52:00,673 --> 00:52:02,010
It's a different picture.

965
00:52:02,011 --> 00:52:05,266
[A different picture than earlier?]

966
00:52:07,740 --> 00:52:09,606
The box from earlier is now open.

967
00:52:11,268 --> 00:52:14,480
- It's gold.
- Ah..  it is?

968
00:52:14,515 --> 00:52:17,586
So the ending from earlier...

969
00:52:17,587 --> 00:52:19,292
[The ending scene from earlier...]

970
00:52:19,293 --> 00:52:26,748
[The couple holding the mysterious box...]

971
00:52:26,749 --> 00:52:30,921
[Then what is the meaning of this box?]

972
00:52:30,922 --> 00:52:33,010
So the couple's been given the box,
and now they've opened it.

973
00:52:33,382 --> 00:52:36,435
So inside the box are two pieces of gold,
and a ballerina figurine.

974
00:52:36,436 --> 00:52:39,462
[Jong Kook and Ara at an advantage from
having seen the inside of the box.]

975
00:52:40,768 --> 00:52:43,051
I think they're each going to
wear the piece, right?

976
00:52:44,072 --> 00:52:46,188
Okay, the Running Man mini-series...

977

to be separated.</i>

980
00:52:57,726 --> 00:52:59,104

Want some?

984
00:53:05,994 --> 00:53:08,126
What is it?
Is it lip balm?

985
00:53:08,127 --> 00:53:09,502
It's a lip tint.
Come here.

986
00:53:11,774 --> 00:53:15,410
You can't let yourself go like that.
Brush your hair a little too.

987
00:53:15,411 --> 00:53:16,791

Look in the camera.

991
00:53:29,181 --> 00:53:30,466
Go like that.

00:53:30,467 --> 00:53:33,610
[Do I look pretty?]

993
00:53:33,611 --> 00:53:35,948
[We're so sexy...]

994
00:53:35,949 --> 00:53:38,872
- Seeing myself like this...
- You think you're pretty?

995
00:53:39,256 --> 00:53:41,714
To be honest, to be between you two
like this, you can't really tell.

996
00:53:41,715 --> 00:53:44,137
[You really can't tell?]

997
00:53:44,765 --> 00:53:45,764

The chairman is stunned and
adamantly objects.

1005
00:54:08,912 --> 00:54:11,062
- He's going to object to your relationship.
- What did you say?

1006
00:54:11,063 --> 00:54:14,059
A birth secret that could mean
a revelation of a real brother and sister...

1007

1017

This is fun.

1019
00:54:55,876 --> 00:54:58,776
What if Ara and I...
What if Ara and I are siblings?

1020
00:55:00,095 --> 00:55:03,944
<i>Once the brother and sister meets and
goes to the DNA testing center...</i>

1021
00:55:05,137 --> 00:55:07,968
<i>It's going to test your name tag to
tell you if you're real brother and sister.</i>

1022
00:55:08,620 --> 00:55:09,824
<i>Once it's been verified that you're real
brother and sister</i>

1023
00:55:09,825 --> 00:55:13,213
<i>you will be able to inherit
the chairman's vast fortune.</i>

1024
00:55:13,745 --> 00:55:14,908
<i>Also...</i>

1025
00:55:14,909 --> 00:55:16,270
<i>those of you who are not real
brother and sister...</i>

1026
00:55:16,271 --> 00:55:20,027
<i>find who the real siblings are
and eliminate them.</i>

1027
00:55:20,667 --> 00:55:24,778
<i>If you take the name tag you've ripped off
to the DNA testing platform</i>

1028
00:55:24,779 --> 00:55:26,964
<i>and set the evidence on there...</i>

1029
00:55:26,965 --> 00:55:28,673
Today's the day!

1030
00:55:28,674 --> 00:55:30,832
- Today's the day!
- Then this is...

1031
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:33,608
So we can't be carefree about who's
name tag we rip off ether.

1032
00:55:33,608 --> 00:55:35,822
Since we don't know who could be
the real siblings amongst us.

1033
00:55:35,822 --> 00:55:39,229
[Will the real siblings separated at birth be
able to reunite to inherit the fortune?]

1034
00:55:39,229 --> 00:55:42,602
[Or will someone else eliminate the
real siblings to steal the fortune?]

1035
00:55:44,302 --> 00:55:46,930
[Final Scene: The hotel.
That Winter, That Typhoon Blows.]

1036
00:55:47,650 --> 00:55:50,312
[The final scene]

1037
00:55:52,288 --> 00:55:54,429
<i>Do we have to search through
all these rooms?</i>

1038
00:55:59,816 --> 00:56:02,585
Where could it be?
What could be the hint?

1039
00:56:03,749 --> 00:56:08,794
[Confused without knowing
what the hint could look like...]

1040
00:56:10,768 --> 00:56:14,140
[At the same time, Ara is...]

1041
00:56:15,100 --> 00:56:16,642
The music box...

1042
00:56:16,643 --> 00:56:19,197
[The box in the drawing...]

1043
00:56:19,197 --> 00:56:20,498
The music box?

1044
00:56:20,499 --> 00:56:22,622
The treasure box?

1045
00:56:22,623 --> 00:56:25,652
And... the picture of the man
and the woman.

1046
00:56:26,877 --> 00:56:28,544
That's all that I saw.

1047
00:56:29,927 --> 00:56:31,085
Music box?

1048
00:56:34,020 --> 00:56:35,911
So I just need to find
the treasure box!

1049
00:56:35,912 --> 00:56:37,112
The treasure box!

1050
00:56:37,778 --> 00:56:43,105
[Could the clue as to who the siblings are
be contained in the treasure box?]

1051
00:56:43,105 --> 00:56:44,713
It could be somewhere around here.

1052
00:56:46,632 --> 00:56:48,158
I wonder if I've gone too far.

1053
00:56:48,765 --> 00:56:50,988
Okay... stay strong, Jong Kook!

1054
00:56:50,989 --> 00:56:53,426
I hope he finds his way too.

1055
00:56:54,175 --> 00:56:55,503
It's not in here either.

1056
00:56:55,504 --> 00:56:59,838
[Could the treasure box be the hint box
as Ara suspects it to be?]

1057
00:57:00,684 --> 00:57:04,356
[These guys are searching aimlessly
without knowing what the hint looks like.]

1058
00:57:04,357 --> 00:57:08,201
But... I'm sure Jong Kook knows something.
What is it that you saw?

1059
00:57:08,202 --> 00:57:09,689
I didn't see anything.

1060
00:57:09,690 --> 00:57:11,735
[Playing dumb]

1061
00:57:12,494 --> 00:57:13,651
You don't see anything?

1062
00:57:13,652 --> 00:57:15,897
I heard that there was a sketchbook
or something like that...

1063
00:57:15,898 --> 00:57:17,609
- What?
- I was told he saw a drawing.

1064
00:57:17,981 --> 00:57:19,291
What did you see?

1065
00:57:19,292 --> 00:57:21,787
- Come on, tell us.
- I seriously didn't see anything.

1066
00:57:22,877 --> 00:57:26,013
- There was no sketchbook.
- Since you saw both, just tell us one.

1067
00:57:26,014 --> 00:57:27,775
- Jong Kook!
- I said, I didn't see anything.

1068
00:57:31,268 --> 00:57:38,127
[The box...
I have to find the treasure box...]

1069
00:57:46,767 --> 00:57:51,521
[That has to be it!]

1070
00:57:57,403 --> 00:58:02,539
[Ara discovers the music box containing
the hint to the siblings' identity!]

1071
00:58:03,513 --> 00:58:05,683
It's a blood test confirmation.

1072
00:58:08,159 --> 00:58:11,580
[The siblings' biological mother's
blood type is 'O'.]

1073
00:58:11,581 --> 00:58:18,043
[Once they figure out the father's blood type
they can figure out the sibling's blood type.]

1074
00:58:18,044 --> 00:58:21,141
I was looking around for boxes,
then I saw this on the box.

1075
00:58:21,142 --> 00:58:23,282
This stays between the three of us.

1076
00:58:23,283 --> 00:58:25,697
The mother's blood type is 'O'.

1077
00:58:26,183 --> 00:58:28,505
- I...
- What's your blood type?

1078
00:58:29,093 --> 00:58:30,191
- Me?
- Yes.

1079
00:58:30,529 --> 00:58:33,063
- Do I have to tell you?
- It's okay.

1080
00:58:33,064 --> 00:58:34,819
Then I'll keep that to myself.

1081
00:58:34,820 --> 00:58:37,153
Why are you being like that?
I can find out on the internet.

1082
00:58:37,154 --> 00:58:38,663
Then you can look it up.

1083
00:58:38,664 --> 00:58:40,657
Yeon Hee... what's your blood type?

1084
00:58:40,658 --> 00:58:44,055
- Why don't you want to tell us?
- I really want to win this time.

1085
00:58:44,056 --> 00:58:45,595
I'm going to search on my own.

1086
00:58:45,596 --> 00:58:47,553
I get that you want to win,
but tell us your blood type.

1087
00:58:47,554 --> 00:58:49,432
Don't try to take the easy way out.

1088
00:58:49,433 --> 00:58:51,625
What do you mean, easy? I'm just
asking you about your blood type.

1089
00:58:55,817 --> 00:58:57,948
Type 'O' is usually a woman.

1090
00:58:57,949 --> 00:59:02,508
So we're searching for the possibilities.
What blood type could come from type 'O'?

1091
00:59:02,509 --> 00:59:04,113
But type 'O' can be a parent to
every other type.

1092
00:59:05,274 --> 00:59:10,693
[If they can find the father's blood type,
they can figure out the sibling's blood type.]

1093
00:59:16,673 --> 00:59:19,322
Do we... have to pay for the water?

1094
00:59:20,833 --> 00:59:22,805
- How much is it?
- It's 1,000 won.

1095
00:59:22,840 --> 00:59:24,435
1,000 won?
Can I have 1,000 won?

1096
00:59:24,436 --> 00:59:25,697
No.

1097
00:59:26,374 --> 00:59:29,555
- I need something to drink.
- Then get what you want.

1098
00:59:35,875 --> 00:59:39,080
[Wait... that's?]

1099
01:00:02,288 --> 01:00:03,513

[Ace appearing out of nowhere
like a ghost.]

1101
01:00:07,544 --> 01:00:10,572
Ji Hyo, that's not it.
I think you must be misunderstood...

1102
01:00:10,572 --> 01:00:13,876
- But that's just kept in there.
- Hand it over, Jae Suk.

1103
01:00:14,473 --> 01:00:16,877
- Hand it over.
- Why are you seriously being like this?

1104
01:00:16,878 --> 01:00:20,178
- Jae Suk, are you going to be like this?
- Seriously, what's wrong with you?

1105
01:00:20,213 --> 01:00:21,766
- Huh?
- I should show this...

1106
01:00:21,766 --> 01:00:23,303
Okay!

1107
01:00:24,019 --> 01:00:25,522
- What is it?
- Are you really going to be like this?

1108
01:00:25,797 --> 01:00:28,491
- You don't want to? Then I'll...
- Fine, hang on.

1109
01:00:32,241 --> 01:00:34,893
I said, fine!
Just put it back in there quickly.

1110
01:00:34,894 --> 01:00:37,834
- Okay.
- Seriously! Where did she come from?

1111
01:00:37,835 --> 01:00:39,518
[No choice but to share
his hint with her.]

1112
01:00:39,519 --> 01:00:41,755
All I was trying to do was buy some water.

1113
01:00:44,111 --> 01:00:46,109
Lots of thick black hair,
and on the taller side...

1114
01:00:46,110 --> 01:00:50,014
[A list of family's physical traits.]

1115
01:00:50,015 --> 01:00:54,057
And the eyes...
so these are the siblings' parents?

1116
01:00:54,058 --> 01:00:57,607
[If they can use this to figure out
who the siblings are...]

1117
01:00:58,617 --> 01:01:00,575
Tall with lots of thick dark hair...

1118
01:01:00,575 --> 01:01:02,343
[Kwang Soo?]

1119
01:01:02,344 --> 01:01:03,528
This one would indicate that.

1120
01:01:03,529 --> 01:01:05,762
It also says that the sister
has pale and clear skin.

1121
01:01:06,208 --> 01:01:09,080
Could it be Yeon Hee?
That sounds like Ara too.

1122
01:01:09,081 --> 01:01:12,840
- Your skin is on the pale side too.
- I don't have pale skin.

1123
01:01:12,841 --> 01:01:15,050
- Really?
- My skin is darker.

1124
01:01:15,654 --> 01:01:16,771
Really?

1125
01:01:18,982 --> 01:01:20,795
Nice clear voice and a broad face?

1126
01:01:23,152 --> 01:01:24,930
- Kim Jong Kook.
- Kang Gary.

1127
01:01:25,350 --> 01:01:27,400
- What about Gary?
- He has a broad smile.

1128
01:01:27,401 --> 01:01:30,253
- How is Gary's broad?
- Jong Kook's is pointy.

1129
01:01:30,753 --> 01:01:33,637
But his whole face is broad
with a robot-like chin.

1130
01:01:33,638 --> 01:01:35,078
That's what Kim Jong Kook's face is like.

1131
01:01:36,180 --> 01:01:37,602
All I thought about was
his pointy chin.

1132
01:01:37,602 --> 01:01:39,205
Kwang Soo can actually
be included in this too

1133
01:01:39,206 --> 01:01:42,316
but this part of the eyes being bright
and intelligent looking doesn't apply to him.

1134

[Bright and intelligent looking eyes-
Kwang Soo's eliminated?]

1135
01:01:44,145 --> 01:01:45,628

- On the skinnier side...

1136
01:01:46,758 --> 01:01:48,006
Yeon Hee?

1137
01:01:48,654 --> 01:01:51,342
- Taller and slim...
- Yeon Hee?

1138
01:01:51,343 --> 01:01:54,086
- With full lips?
- But she doesn't have the fullest lips.

1139
01:01:55,038 --> 01:01:56,331
- Ara?
- Ara has fuller lips.

1140
01:01:57,498 --> 01:02:00,367
[The more they look at the list,
the more possibilities they're seeing...]

01:02:16,302 --> 01:02:20,006
[Huh?
The sound of a dog barking?]

1145
01:02:23,646 --> 01:02:25,862
Why... why is the dog barking
like that?

1146
01:02:25,863 --> 01:02:29,117
Kwang Soo... there's no way that dog
is here for no reason.

1147
01:02:32,622 --> 01:02:35,313
I thought that maybe the dog would have
some sort of a key around its neck...

1148
01:02:35,314 --> 01:02:36,819
- But I don't see anything.
- Right? there's nothing.

1149
01:02:36,820 --> 01:02:38,255
Why is it acting like that?

1150
01:02:39,105 --> 01:02:40,423
What?
What does that mean?

- Yeon Hee, want some information?
- Yes, tell me.

01:03:01,307 --> 01:03:02,793
- I'll show you something.
- Did you find a hint?

1159
01:03:02,794 --> 01:03:05,675
Of course, I did!
I've been doing this show for years!

1160

You already found something?

1161
01:03:07,743 --> 01:03:09,743
You can't tell anyone about this.

1162
01:03:09,744 --> 01:03:15,337
What I have here is a letter the dad wrote
to the mom before the second child was born.

1163
01:03:15,338 --> 01:03:17,553
- It's a love letter.
- Before the second child was born?

1164
01:03:18,627 --> 01:03:20,396
<i>To my loving wife...</i>

1165

firstborn made me want to write a letter...</i>

and excitement...</i>

who loves to do the shuffle dance...</i>

The child isn't a very good student.

We were all pretty bad students.

1171
01:03:40,077 --> 01:03:42,121
The letter also says the son
likes running.

01:04:32,817 --> 01:04:36,747
[Jae Suk finally breaks his way in.]

1180
01:04:38,553 --> 01:04:39,791
Kwang Soo...

1181
01:04:40,493 --> 01:04:41,985
Hand it over, Kwang Soo.

1182
01:04:43,060 --> 01:04:47,111
[Nothing goes right for Kwang Soon.]

1183
01:04:48,541 --> 01:04:51,931
[Takes the hint out of his mouth...]

1184
01:04:52,878 --> 01:04:54,054
Go Dong Wan?

1185
01:04:54,055 --> 01:04:58,237
['R' Group-
Corporate attorney, Go Dong Wan.]

1186
01:04:59,247 --> 01:05:05,100
[Looking for a fax to contact the fax number
that was found on the business card.]

1187
01:05:05,100 --> 01:05:07,097
[That scoundrel!]

1188
01:05:10,381 --> 01:05:11,988
Hey, Lee Kwang Soo!

1189
01:05:13,865 --> 01:05:16,908
[Why is he running away like that?
What is he up to?]

1190
01:05:19,108 --> 01:05:23,243
If you were going down to the first floor,
why couldn't you have taken the elevator?

1191
01:05:25,619 --> 01:05:28,417
[First floor lobby]

1192
01:05:28,418 --> 01:05:30,418
Can you tell me where your
fax machine is?

1193
01:05:31,670 --> 01:05:33,821
- It's in the business center.
- Business center? Thank you.

1194
01:05:34,824 --> 01:05:40,428
[Giraffe in a rush to find the fax alone
in order to find out what the hint is.]

1195
01:05:42,864 --> 01:05:45,529
[Even locking up the door.]

1196
01:05:53,029 --> 01:05:54,092
You!

1197
01:05:54,093 --> 01:05:56,946
Hurry up and open up the door
before I call all the guys.

1198
01:05:57,857 --> 01:05:59,395
Hey, Lee Kwang Soo!

1199
01:06:00,158 --> 01:06:02,342
- How do you work this thing?
- I'm calling Jong Kook right now!

1200
01:06:03,555 --> 01:06:04,857
Kwang Soo...

1201
01:06:05,196 --> 01:06:07,367
If you keep being like this,
I'm going to text everyone!

1202
01:06:07,930 --> 01:06:11,511
Kwang Soo, that's not how you work it.
I said, that's not how you work it.

1203
01:06:11,511 --> 01:06:13,812
[Giraffe not caring about his methods
once he sees an opportunity.]

1204
01:06:16,040 --> 01:06:17,359
Excuse me!

1205
01:06:17,360 --> 01:06:19,664
Can you give me the key
to the business center?

1206
01:06:21,268 --> 01:06:23,108
- Jae Suk, do you know how to work this?
- Yes, I know.

1207
01:06:25,722 --> 01:06:27,085
Where did Ji Hyo go?

1208
01:06:27,852 --> 01:06:30,462
- Where did Ji Hyo go?
- She went to get the key.

1209
01:06:31,222 --> 01:06:32,458
The key.

1210
01:06:35,791 --> 01:06:37,202
We have to be quick.

1211
01:06:37,203 --> 01:06:39,002
I'm going to lock the door.

1212
01:06:39,003 --> 01:06:41,251
[He's just as clueless
about how to operate the machine.]

1213
01:06:42,166 --> 01:06:45,042
- Jae Suk... I opened the door for you.
- I know.

1214
01:06:46,342 --> 01:06:49,713
[Blank Ji rushing back after
having acquired the key.]

1215
01:06:53,452 --> 01:06:54,634
It doesn't fit!

1216
01:06:56,147 --> 01:06:58,404
- Ji Hyo's back with the key.
- It doesn't fit.

1217
01:06:58,405 --> 01:06:59,611
Seriously...

1218
01:07:02,299 --> 01:07:03,886
I'll try to hold her off.

1219
01:07:06,006 --> 01:07:07,954
I'll try to hold her off
as long as I can.

1220
01:07:08,319 --> 01:07:09,928
[He really is trying hard...]

1221
01:07:19,050 --> 01:07:20,120
Hi, Ji Hyo.

1222
01:07:20,850 --> 01:07:23,255
[Just a simple pull of the door.]

1223
01:07:24,316 --> 01:07:29,862
[The same result as if the three of them
happily came in together.]

1224
01:07:29,863 --> 01:07:32,454
- I was going to tell you all about it.
- Don't even mess with me.

1225
01:07:34,034 --> 01:07:35,836
I think I really must be unlucky.

1226
01:07:35,837 --> 01:07:39,171
Jae Suk... this is the output tray.

1227
01:07:39,172 --> 01:07:40,924
- That's the output tray?
- This is it... this is where you insert.

1228
01:07:42,628 --> 01:07:44,097
- Where?
- You put it in here...

1229
01:07:50,577 --> 01:07:52,371
- Something's coming out.
- I don't think that was right.

1230
01:07:52,372 --> 01:07:53,631
Why is this coming out?

1231
01:07:54,702 --> 01:07:59,048
[Huh? What did they press for blank
sheets of paper to keep coming out?]

1232
01:07:59,049 --> 01:08:00,515
Why are all these blank sheets
of paper coming out?

1233
01:08:00,516 --> 01:08:02,173
Why do these keep coming out?

1234
01:08:05,717 --> 01:08:08,071
- Jae Suk...
- Why do these blank sheets keep coming out?

1235
01:08:09,932 --> 01:08:14,492
[Sending a blank feed of fax
isn't going to do anything...]

1236
01:08:14,493 --> 01:08:18,897
[Must fax some sort of a message for
a response to be faxed back...]

1237
01:08:18,898 --> 01:08:21,506
I can't believe I'm working with you
two clueless people!

1238
01:08:22,012 --> 01:08:23,824
[The nerve to even say those words...]

1239
01:08:23,825 --> 01:08:25,887
How could you have sent something
without writing a message on it first?

1240
01:08:26,160 --> 01:08:30,802
[Must send in their question to
Attorney Go Dong Wan...]

1241
01:08:30,803 --> 01:08:33,084
Ask him who the male and
the female is.

1242
01:08:33,085 --> 01:08:35,128
I don't think he's going to answer
such a point blank question like that.

1243
01:08:35,128 --> 01:08:36,875
[He's not going to answer such
an obvious question as that...]

1244
01:08:36,875 --> 01:08:40,308
[Jae Suk's inquiry]

1245
01:08:40,308 --> 01:08:42,874
- You have to ask a question.
- I asked for a hint.

1246
01:08:42,875 --> 01:08:44,307
Don't you have to write it
in a question form?

1247
01:08:47,868 --> 01:08:48,876
It's Gary.

1248
01:08:50,570 --> 01:08:51,752
Yes, Gary.

1249
01:08:51,753 --> 01:08:53,015
<i>Kwang Soo, where are you?</i>

1250
01:08:53,016 --> 01:08:54,627
I'm on the third floor right now.

1251
01:08:55,254 --> 01:08:57,915
[This is the first floor...]

1252
01:08:57,915 --> 01:09:02,609
[Giraffe's non-stop lies without
changing one facial expression.]

1253
01:09:02,610 --> 01:09:05,369
- Did Jae Suk find anything?
- You can't even tell that he's lying.

1254
01:09:05,370 --> 01:09:08,731
- I don't think he found anything.
- I really thought we were on the third floor.

1255
01:09:09,233 --> 01:09:12,410
[Giraffe's lies are so believable that they
all thought they may be on the third floor.]

1256
01:09:12,410 --> 01:09:14,545
Okay, Gary.
I'll call you later.

1257
01:09:14,546 --> 01:09:16,670
<i>Okay.
You haven't found any hints?</i>

1258
01:09:16,671 --> 01:09:17,999
No.

1259
01:09:19,489 --> 01:09:23,627
[Jae Suk is faxing his request for a hint
over to Attorney Go Dong Wan.]

1260
01:09:23,628 --> 01:09:24,899
I'll call you later, okay?

1261
01:09:24,900 --> 01:09:25,987
<i>Okay.</i>

1262
01:09:28,050 --> 01:09:30,202
You telling him that you'll call him later
was a lie too, wasn't it?

1263
01:09:31,028 --> 01:09:33,895
Well... I can just call him
back tomorrow.

1264
01:09:34,963 --> 01:09:36,935
[An immediate reply from Attorney Go!]

1265
01:09:36,936 --> 01:09:40,268
[Who are you?]

1266
01:09:40,269 --> 01:09:41,591
Give him my name.

1267
01:09:42,239 --> 01:09:43,612
Since I found the hint.

1268
01:09:45,266 --> 01:09:48,596
[Since they only have one chance at asking
the question, no other choice but to...]

1269
01:09:48,597 --> 01:09:50,394
There's no need to sign it too.

1270
01:09:51,538 --> 01:09:53,680
[Even though this is
their one and only chance...]

1271
01:09:53,681 --> 01:09:58,668
[The question asked is,
'Is Kwang Soo the brother?']

1272
01:10:03,035 --> 01:10:05,712
Doesn't this feel like something...
you'd see in a movie?

1273
01:10:06,199 --> 01:10:08,526
If they take this long in a movie...

1274
01:10:09,250 --> 01:10:10,820
- We'd all be dead by now.
- It'd be over.

1275
01:10:10,821 --> 01:10:12,719
I was just making a comment.

1276
01:10:17,407 --> 01:10:21,475
[Could Kwang Soo be the real brother?]

1277
01:10:23,072 --> 01:10:24,238
This is Attorney Go Dong Wan.

1278
01:10:24,239 --> 01:10:26,901
I've done a lot of research,
but from what I've gathered so far

1279
01:10:26,901 --> 01:10:29,313
I don't think you or Ji Suk Jin are it.

1280
01:10:34,653 --> 01:10:37,413
[Attorney Go's verdict:
Kwang Soo and Suk Jin are not the brother!]

1281
01:10:40,609 --> 01:10:44,817
[Yeon Hee discovers the dog
Jong Kook and Kwang Soo saw earlier.]

1282
01:10:44,818 --> 01:10:47,384
What do you know?
Where's your owner?

1283
01:10:48,065 --> 01:10:49,286
Stand up.

1284
01:10:49,287 --> 01:10:51,379
Stand up!
There you go.

1285
01:10:51,979 --> 01:10:56,182
[Unlike earlier, the dog is
very calm with Yeon Hee?]

1286
01:10:58,902 --> 01:11:00,935
The dog is starting to show
interest in me.

1287
01:11:00,936 --> 01:11:02,532
Do you know something?

1288
01:11:02,533 --> 01:11:03,824
Where's the hint?

1289
01:11:03,825 --> 01:11:08,151
[Cozying up to Yeon Hee as if
it wants to play with her.]

1290
01:11:10,712 --> 01:11:12,168
You're cute.

1291
01:11:12,169 --> 01:11:15,169
[What is the purpose of this dog?]

1292
01:11:16,742 --> 01:11:20,930
[On the other hand,
Gary still hasn't found a single clue.]

1293
01:11:25,584 --> 01:11:27,073
I wonder if there's something in here.

1294
01:11:29,410 --> 01:11:30,584
Why is it making sounds?

1295
01:11:30,818 --> 01:11:33,986
[Finally discovers a box
containing the clues!]

1296
01:11:37,921 --> 01:11:39,348
Gary... you found something!

1297
01:11:39,661 --> 01:11:42,808
[Yeon Hee picks this moment
to walk into the room!]

1298
01:11:45,221 --> 01:11:46,944
How did you find me?

1299
01:11:47,901 --> 01:11:52,221
[What did he find in the box?]

1300
01:11:55,995 --> 01:12:00,083
[It looks like pages from a magazine?]

1301
01:12:04,926 --> 01:12:06,975
Hey...
Yeon Hee, I think I got it.

1302
01:12:06,976 --> 01:12:11,056
[Gary seems to know what the clue
is referring to?]

1303
01:12:11,057 --> 01:12:12,477
Fold it back up.

1304
01:12:12,478 --> 01:12:14,006
This is...

1305
01:12:14,007 --> 01:12:15,320
Yeon Hee...

1306
01:12:15,321 --> 01:12:16,624
I just got chills down my spine.

1307
01:12:16,625 --> 01:12:18,338
Is it Ddak-ji?

1308
01:12:18,924 --> 01:12:22,252
[This was folded into the shape
of a Ddak-ji?]

1309
01:12:24,118 --> 01:12:28,600
[When it comes to Ddak-ji,
Gary was once the King of Ddak-ji.]

1310
01:12:28,601 --> 01:12:34,511
[And Jong Kook too for having
turned over the Ultimate Ddak-ji...]

1311
01:12:34,511 --> 01:12:39,109
[And Jae Suk always comes to mind
when Ddak-ji is mentioned...]

1312
01:12:40,053 --> 01:12:42,403
[Possible candidates for the brother.]

1313
01:12:42,403 --> 01:12:46,631
[Narrowed down to these three?]

1314
01:12:48,382 --> 01:12:53,240
[If pieced together with the other clues...]

1315
01:12:53,240 --> 01:12:54,989
Jae Suk?

1316
01:12:54,990 --> 01:12:56,962
Right?
You're thinking of Jae Suk too, right?

1317
01:12:56,963 --> 01:12:59,938
- Does Jae Suk like to run?
- He's a fast runner.

1318
01:13:00,719 --> 01:13:03,826
When a person is a fast runner,
it means they used to run a lot as a kid.

1319
01:13:06,747 --> 01:13:10,284
- You don't think it's you, do you?
- I'm positive it's not me.

1320
01:13:11,334 --> 01:13:16,214
[Yeah... I think Jae Suk is the brother...]

1321
01:13:17,167 --> 01:13:19,377
<i>We all need to get our
heads on straight.</i>

1322
01:13:19,378 --> 01:13:22,701
[After having seen the fax,
Kwang Soo's busy sharing his information.]

1323
01:13:22,702 --> 01:13:24,555
- What I just said...
- What confuses me is...

1324
01:13:25,290 --> 01:13:27,431
- We...
- You and I are not it, right?

1325
01:13:27,432 --> 01:13:30,069
- No, we're not.
- Then how does this work?

1326
01:13:30,070 --> 01:13:31,512
If you and I aren't it...

1327
01:13:31,513 --> 01:13:33,159
[If the person is found not to
be one of the siblings...]

1328
01:13:33,160 --> 01:13:39,823
[They must rip off the name tag of the person
they think to be it to win the race!]

1329
01:13:39,823 --> 01:13:42,065
Then we need to find the heir quickly.

1330
01:13:42,066 --> 01:13:46,873
[Now the Easy Brothers just needs to
eliminate the rest without hesitation.]

1331
01:13:46,874 --> 01:13:48,901
Then if we were to rip off his name,
do we just take it to the DNA platform?

1332
01:13:48,902 --> 01:13:51,030
No, that's not it.
You are given only one chance.

1333
01:13:51,546 --> 01:13:54,960
[Ha Ha seems to be proposing
something...]

1334
01:13:55,186 --> 01:13:56,728
Can we work together as
a team again?

1335
01:13:56,729 --> 01:13:59,316
If you can give us a solid proof
that you're not the brother.

1336
01:13:59,317 --> 01:14:00,556
If you can give us solid proof, then yes.

1337
01:14:00,557 --> 01:14:03,594
You have something, don't you?
See this... look at this!

1338
01:14:03,595 --> 01:14:05,687
[Ha Ha hid away the hint he found
inside his sock!]

1339
01:14:10,970 --> 01:14:13,548
[Suk Jin, out!]

1340
01:14:13,548 --> 01:14:16,216
Kwang Soo... I have this.
Are you with me or not?

1341
01:14:16,217 --> 01:14:17,649
- I'm with you.
- You're with me?

1342
01:14:18,338 --> 01:14:21,490
[Anything is possible in
the Traitors' Club!]

1343
01:14:22,158 --> 01:14:26,056
[Suk Jin's letter clue goes to Ha Ha.]

1344
01:14:27,428 --> 01:14:30,206
Since it was two against one,
I knew that I had to eliminate one.

1345
01:14:37,461 --> 01:14:38,653
<i>What are you guys doing?</i>

1346
01:14:38,654 --> 01:14:40,265
What's going on here?

1347
01:14:40,941 --> 01:14:42,713
Hang on Jae Suk.
Kwang Soo...

1348
01:14:42,714 --> 01:14:45,378
- Way's going on?
- Wait. It's not me.

1349
01:14:46,615 --> 01:14:48,480
<i>- What's going on?
- What do you mean, what's going on?</i>

1350
01:14:48,481 --> 01:14:50,517
Are you by any chance, the brother?

1351
01:14:50,518 --> 01:14:57,139
[The possibilities from the remaining
survivors are diminishing in numbers.]

1352
01:14:57,140 --> 01:14:58,835
I'm not really sure
if I'm the brother or not.

1353
01:14:58,836 --> 01:15:00,187
<i>What do you know, Jae Suk?</i>

1354
01:15:01,139 --> 01:15:02,500
<i>Pale skin...</i>

1355
01:15:03,389 --> 01:15:04,967
<i>- You have pale skin too.
- But...</i>

1356
01:15:07,177 --> 01:15:08,803
Kwang Soo definitely is not it.

1357
01:15:08,804 --> 01:15:09,947
I know.

1358
01:15:09,948 --> 01:15:11,894
- Eliminate him.
- Okay.

1359
01:15:13,396 --> 01:15:16,345
[Deciding to eliminate Kwang Soo first
since he's a threat of danger.]

1360
01:15:16,346 --> 01:15:17,631
Kwang Soo, come out here.

1361
01:15:17,632 --> 01:15:19,598
- What?
- Come out here, Kwang Soo. Hurry!

1362
01:15:20,636 --> 01:15:22,979
[Why is he acting like that?]

1363
01:15:22,980 --> 01:15:24,223
Come out here!

1364
01:15:25,415 --> 01:15:27,161
- Move your finger.
- Kwang Soo, hurry.

1365
01:15:27,162 --> 01:15:31,161
[It's Jae Suk!]

1366
01:15:34,571 --> 01:15:36,697
<i>Extremely jovial...</i>

1367
01:15:36,698 --> 01:15:41,949
[A mischievous little boy
who's also a good dancer.]

1368
01:15:41,950 --> 01:15:44,102
[Likes to run...]

1369
01:15:44,102 --> 01:15:46,488
[And a Ddak-ji expert.]

1370
01:15:48,790 --> 01:15:51,648
Also very excitable.
Could it be Jae Suk?

1371
01:15:53,154 --> 01:15:55,492
[The brother who's about to inherit
the vast fortune is...]

1372
01:15:55,493 --> 01:15:58,894
[It has to be Jae Suk.]

1373
01:16:00,356 --> 01:16:03,810
Come out here. There's no one out here.
Open the door and see for yourself.

1374
01:16:05,030 --> 01:16:06,113
I'm leaving.

1375
01:16:08,214 --> 01:16:10,948
[The Giraffe steps out of the room...]

1376
01:16:10,948 --> 01:16:12,744
[And attacks?]

1377
01:16:12,745 --> 01:16:14,040
What are you doing?

1378
01:16:16,415 --> 01:16:17,877
What's wrong with you?

1379
01:16:21,253 --> 01:16:23,483
[Kwang Soo, out!]

1380
01:16:23,484 --> 01:16:27,054
[With nothing to lose,
the Giraffe attacks anyone in his path!]

1381
01:16:28,730 --> 01:16:30,054
<i>You sneaky little fox.</i>

1382
01:16:30,055 --> 01:16:31,608
Forget this.

1383
01:16:32,601 --> 01:16:35,330
- You and Suk Jin aren't it.
- Dong Hoon has a hint hidden in his sock.

1384
01:16:36,206 --> 01:16:38,767
[The traitor's gene is rooted
in his DNA.]

1385
01:16:39,067 --> 01:16:42,229
[While Ha Ha is being targeted...]

1386
01:16:43,803 --> 01:16:48,339
[Yeon Hee's hand is...]

1387
01:16:49,035 --> 01:16:52,442
[Feeling certain that
she's not the sister...]

1388
01:16:52,443 --> 01:16:57,934
[Eyeing the real suspect,
Jae Suk's name tag!]

1389
01:17:03,495 --> 01:17:07,195
[Yeon Hee eliminates
Jae Suk's name tag!]

1390
01:17:09,044 --> 01:17:10,828
What just happened?

1391
01:17:10,829 --> 01:17:12,326
[Jae Suk is ultimately eliminated.]

1392
01:17:12,327 --> 01:17:18,613
[Could he truly be the real brother?]

1393
01:17:19,531 --> 01:17:24,869
[Running away with Jae Suk's hint
in her possession.]

1394
01:17:24,870 --> 01:17:26,460
We can't let Dong Hoon see that.

1395
01:17:26,461 --> 01:17:29,322
We can't let Dong Hoon see that.
So hurry... come here and sit down.

1396
01:17:30,496 --> 01:17:32,848
They found a lot of clues.

1397
01:17:34,891 --> 01:17:35,988
What is this?

1398
01:17:36,536 --> 01:17:38,982
Gary, this is a list.

1399
01:17:40,406 --> 01:17:43,321
- Smaller face...
- The mom's side is...

1400
01:17:43,322 --> 01:17:45,088
I think it's all referring to
the traits of a woman.

1401
01:17:45,424 --> 01:17:47,912
An egg shape.
A small and egg shaped face.

1402
01:17:47,913 --> 01:17:49,566
That's all us girls.

1403
01:17:49,567 --> 01:17:51,201
Ara's face is like that too.

1404
01:17:51,938 --> 01:17:55,506
First... this part about the pale skin...

1405
01:17:55,507 --> 01:17:59,203
- That's all of us again.
- No, Ji Hyo's skin is darker.

1406
01:17:59,204 --> 01:18:00,754
So I don't think it's Ji Hyo.

1407
01:18:00,755 --> 01:18:02,210
So that would leave me and Ara.

1408
01:18:02,211 --> 01:18:05,349
I think it's between you and Ara.

1409
01:18:06,314 --> 01:18:09,495
If the father's side has smaller eyes,
and has monolids...

1410
01:18:09,496 --> 01:18:12,092
So it could have been passed
down to the child.

1411
01:18:13,419 --> 01:18:17,059
But looking at this list, a lot of it
seems to be referring to Jae Suk.

1412
01:18:17,879 --> 01:18:21,362
- This sounds like Jae Suk too.
- And this one.

1413
01:18:21,363 --> 01:18:23,548
With a nice voice and a broad face.

1414
01:18:23,549 --> 01:18:25,526
But this face...

1415
01:18:25,527 --> 01:18:30,148
Jong Kook's face is developed like this,
and Jae Suk's is like this.

1416
01:18:30,149 --> 01:18:32,471
[Jong Kook with a rectangular face,
vs. Jae Suk's protruding face.]

1417
01:18:33,593 --> 01:18:35,533
[Jong Kook's starting to sound
like a good possibility too...]

1418
01:18:35,534 --> 01:18:40,425
[Could it be Jong Kook?]

1419
01:18:40,426 --> 01:18:43,836
So the mother's blood type is 'O'.

1420
01:18:43,837 --> 01:18:46,890
So what we need to find quickly is
the father's blood type.

1421
01:18:46,891 --> 01:18:48,947
[Must find the father's blood type.]

1422
01:18:53,392 --> 01:18:55,166
If the door's open, then it
means someone's already checked?

1423
01:18:57,976 --> 01:19:02,434
[Carefully checking each room
that hasn't been searched through yet.]

1424
01:19:02,435 --> 01:19:04,344
- I don't think it's in here.
- I don't think so either.

1425
01:19:10,019 --> 01:19:11,494
Check the safe.

1426
01:19:11,495 --> 01:19:15,970
[Rechecking the safes and the drawers.]

1427
01:19:18,236 --> 01:19:20,178
Check the safe, Ara.

1428
01:19:21,293 --> 01:19:23,055
- Jong Kook!
- Is it in there?

1429
01:19:23,056 --> 01:19:25,608
[Discovers a box containing a clue!]

1430
01:19:25,609 --> 01:19:27,025
Let's see.

1431
01:19:44,814 --> 01:19:47,017
<i>There was a key... here it is.</i>

1432
01:19:47,978 --> 01:19:53,332
[Yeon Hee is searching the outdoor
lockers with Gary.]

1433
01:19:53,333 --> 01:19:54,646
You want me to start opening
from the bottom?

1434
01:20:01,048 --> 01:20:04,824
[The four finally faces off.]

1435
01:20:07,086 --> 01:20:11,528
[What is the truth?]

1436
01:20:11,529 --> 01:20:15,738
[Could there be a real brother and sister
amongst this group of four?]

1437
01:20:15,739 --> 01:20:18,093
- What are you talking about?
- This is just a drama.

1438
01:20:18,094 --> 01:20:20,329
- You can't trust him.
- This is not real love.

1439
01:20:20,330 --> 01:20:22,012
- Ara...
- How can you talk like that?

1440
01:20:22,428 --> 01:20:24,798
- Do you know who the siblings are?
- Do you know?

1441
01:20:24,799 --> 01:20:26,822
- Do you know who it is?
- Ara, do you know who it is?

1442
01:20:26,823 --> 01:20:28,553
I assure you, it's not me.

1443
01:20:28,554 --> 01:20:31,108
- Do you know who it is?
- I think I know.

1444
01:20:31,109 --> 01:20:35,698
[Jong Kook and Ara seem to be
searching for something specific...]

1445
01:20:35,699 --> 01:20:38,423
- You're the sister.
- How do you know that?

1446
01:20:38,423 --> 01:20:41,255
[Yeon Hee is the sister?]

1447
01:20:41,256 --> 01:20:43,356
Yeon Hee, it's you.

1448
01:20:43,565 --> 01:20:44,920
How did you get separated
from your father?

1449
01:20:44,920 --> 01:20:49,398
What's the definitive clue that you have
that proves I'm the sister?

1450
01:20:50,125 --> 01:20:52,750
- Tell me what your proof is.
- The blood type...

1451
01:20:52,751 --> 01:20:56,249
- I don't think we should tell them that.
- Ara, is it the blood type?

1452
01:20:56,250 --> 01:20:57,681
It's the blood type.

1453
01:20:57,682 --> 01:20:59,487
The blood type we saw together earlier?

1454
01:21:01,509 --> 01:21:02,882
- Yeon Hee, be careful.
- What we saw earlier together?

1455
01:21:03,453 --> 01:21:05,367
- Yeon Hee, be careful.
- It's your blood type.

1456
01:21:05,368 --> 01:21:08,973
- What blood type?
- It just said that the mom was type 'O'.

1457
01:21:08,974 --> 01:21:11,484
[Yeon Hee who knows as far as
the mom having type 'O'.]

1458
01:21:11,484 --> 01:21:12,938
And the last thing we found...

1459
01:21:17,953 --> 01:21:19,529
The father has type B.

1460
01:21:19,530 --> 01:21:21,791
[Father's blood type is B.]

1461
01:21:21,792 --> 01:21:22,949
The dad has type B.

1462
01:21:22,949 --> 01:21:27,094
- So whether it's the daughter or the son...
- Whether it's the son or the daughter...

1463
01:21:27,095 --> 01:21:28,959
They have to have either
B or O type, right?

1464
01:21:28,960 --> 01:21:31,592
- It has to be either type B or O.
- You're right.

1465
01:21:31,593 --> 01:21:35,003
[In that case, the children's blood type
has to be either B or O.]

1466
01:21:35,004 --> 01:21:36,790
- What did you say Jae Suk's was?
- B.

1467
01:21:36,791 --> 01:21:38,477
B?
Yeon Hee's is B too.

1468
01:21:38,478 --> 01:21:41,169
[Suspect Jae Suk's type is B,
and Yeon Hee's type is also B.]

1469
01:21:41,170 --> 01:21:43,856
All we know is that the
mom has type O.

1470
01:21:43,857 --> 01:21:45,480
That's all we found.

1471
01:21:45,481 --> 01:21:47,343
- I'm type B.
- The last thing we found...

1472
01:21:47,734 --> 01:21:49,928
- Is the father type B?
- Father is.

1473
01:21:49,929 --> 01:21:53,599
- So the father has type B?
- What's Jae Suk's blood type?

1474
01:21:53,781 --> 01:21:55,109
Type B.

1475
01:21:55,110 --> 01:21:56,433
- That's right.
- Type B.

1476
01:21:56,434 --> 01:21:59,893
- If type O and type B...
- Type B.

1477
01:21:59,894 --> 01:22:01,753
The only possibility would be
either type O or type B.

1478
01:22:01,754 --> 01:22:03,775
You're type A and I'm
also type A.

1479
01:22:03,776 --> 01:22:05,763
I'm type A too.

1480
01:22:06,893 --> 01:22:12,826
[The sister is Yeon Hee.
In that case...]

1481
01:22:12,826 --> 01:22:18,182
<i>This is a love letter the dad wrote to
the mom before the second child was born.</i>

1482
01:22:18,183 --> 01:22:20,327
<i>This part here about the child
being very lively and excitable.</i>

1483
01:22:20,328 --> 01:22:22,330
<i>And loves to dance...</i>

1484
01:22:22,331 --> 01:22:24,512
[And a hint no one realized...]

1485
01:22:24,513 --> 01:22:27,051
[The wife is an 'Announcer'.]

1486
01:22:27,052 --> 01:22:28,930
<i>A small egg shaped face.</i>

1487
01:22:28,931 --> 01:22:34,149
[The features from the mother's side
describes Yeon Hee.]

1488
01:22:34,150 --> 01:22:37,500
<i>Smaller eyes with monolids.</i>

1489
01:22:37,501 --> 01:22:41,140
<i>I think a lot of this is
describing Jae Suk.</i>

1490
01:22:42,036 --> 01:22:44,059
<i>This sounds like Jae Suk too.</i>

1491
01:22:47,533 --> 01:22:49,479
<i>Jae Suk's face is like this.</i>

1492
01:22:50,650 --> 01:22:52,907
<i>Jae Suk's always liked Ddak-ji
ever since he was a kid.</i>

1493
01:22:55,307 --> 01:22:56,807
[The barking's dog's meaning...]

1494
01:22:56,808 --> 01:23:01,150
[It's the same kind of a dog
the siblings used to raise as kids.

1495
01:23:01,150 --> 01:23:04,768
[That's why the dog was so calm
when it saw Yeon Hee.]

1496
01:23:05,672 --> 01:23:09,296
[And at a closer look,
it didn't bark at Jae Suk either.]

1497
01:23:10,692 --> 01:23:15,760
[But no one caught on to that truth...]

1498
01:23:15,760 --> 01:23:20,733
[The brother and sister who are to
inherit the vast fortune are...]

1499
01:23:20,734 --> 01:23:24,767
[Jae Suk and Yeon Hee.]

1500
01:23:27,549 --> 01:23:32,025
[Blank...]

1501
01:23:32,915 --> 01:23:34,461
Jae Suk is your brother.

1502
01:23:36,443 --> 01:23:38,139
Poor Jae Suk, what do I do?

1503
01:23:38,799 --> 01:23:42,957

winner is going to be yet.

Ara, come here.
Come stand by me.

1510
01:24:01,039 --> 01:24:03,742
Come this way, Ara.
This way... this way.

1511
01:24:04,996 --> 01:24:06,094
Run!
Run, Yeon Hee!

1512
01:24:06,094 --> 01:24:09,096

the DNA testing machine!]

1513

name tag on the podium, she'll win!]

1517
01:24:41,445 --> 01:24:42,593
Ara, did you get them up there?

1518
01:24:42,594 --> 01:24:45,350
[Two name tags are finally
placed on the DNA testing podium!]

1519
01:24:45,351 --> 01:24:47,920

- No, we're not wrong.

1520
01:24:49,383 --> 01:24:54,556
[Are Jae Suk and Yeon Hee
the 'R' Group's successors?]

1521
01:24:56,412 --> 01:24:59,159
[99.9% match!]

1522
01:24:59,160 --> 01:25:02,852
[Jae Suk and Yeon Hee are siblings!]

1523
01:25:06,140 --> 01:25:08,981
- You should've ran a little faster.
- You two are brother and sister?

1524
01:25:08,982 --> 01:25:14,880
[Since the DNA has been tested,
the inheritance will go to Ara!]

1525
01:25:16,678 --> 01:25:18,723
Who's the brother?

1526
01:25:19,414 --> 01:25:21,847

- Brother!

1527
01:25:21,848 --> 01:25:23,212

[The siblings reunited!]

1529
01:25:26,641 --> 01:25:28,589
And you eliminated me?

1530
01:25:29,268 --> 01:25:33,022
[The end result is that
this was a messy makjang drama.]

1531
01:25:33,612 --> 01:25:36,907
[No inheritance was earned,
and the sibling relationship is ruined.]

1532
01:25:36,908 --> 01:25:40,151
['R' Group's fortune goes to Ara!]

1533
01:25:40,152 --> 01:25:42,924
How could you have done this to me?
You're my little sister?

1534
01:25:42,925 --> 01:25:45,974
<i>There was one definitive clue that
none of you were able to pick up on.</i>

1535

- Really?

1543

1544
01:26:04,490 --> 01:26:06,471
- It's you?
- Is that Ara? I mean, Yeon Hee?

1545
01:26:06,472 --> 01:26:08,846

01:26:17,614 --> 01:26:23,062
[The final story is that of lovers,

and just ends up killing her brother...

1551

with the story of two lovers.</i>

1552
01:26:29,195 --> 01:26:32,476

- Why did you do it, Yeon Hee?

1553
01:26:32,477 --> 01:26:34,289
