[Most water-logged seat...]

24
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:33,380
[Combination of getting soaked,
and getting water slapped.]

25
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:37,010
Why is it just my seat that's
getting soaked like this?

26
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,280
[On the other hand,
Giraffe, Blank-Ji, Ro-Ro, and Kkuk...]

27

00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:19,020
I didn't bring any change of clothing!

00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:21,300
- Who's that?
- Who is it?

43
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:25,340
[Down the stream...]

- What are you doing?
- We can kind of see your name tag.

00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:00,090
Is he a dummy?

57
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:02,890
[Duh... the name tag!]

58
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:06,430

- It's been so long since I've seen Ji Won.
- Ji Won and Jessica are like family!

68
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:38,270
I thought I'd never get to see you
guesting on our show!

69
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:40,140

[Is Jessica embarrassed?]

84
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:24,660
- You know that's not right!
- Do you not like that?

85
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:26,910
I think Ji Hyo would be better
suited as the rabbit.

86
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:28,970
How about... a poisonous snake?

87
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:31,840
- What did you say?
- How can you compare her to a snake?

88
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,700
[Elementary school level jokes that
just keep on going.]

89
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:38,840
- What do you mean, a poisonous snake?
- Something regal... like a cobra?

90

a mission today</i>

91

- I think this is going to be so much fun!
- Something could be lurking in here.

96
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,430
[What is the safari mission that's been
prepared for the Running Man members?]

97
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:17,440
- I have something for each one of you.
- Okay.

98
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:20,410
[Something inside the envelopes?]

99
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:22,120
Is there a mission inside the card?

100

- What does the 'elephant' mean?
- What is this?

an animal written on the inside.]

103
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,470
- A rhino.
- I have the rhino.

104
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:35,430
[Hm?]

105
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:36,820
- What is that?
- What did he get?

106
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:39,100
[A two-humped camel!]

107
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:42,100
[It's somehow fitting...]

108
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:44,650
- Why does it suit you so well?
- Suk Jin...

109
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:47,560

What is the white tiger?

110

<i>These are the animals that you will
all have to meet from this moment.</i>

111
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:54,800
<i>When you go see these animals,
you'll learn what your mission will be.</i>

112
00:05:56,300 --> 00:06:01,040
[Is it going to be like the panda mission
they had to do in Hong Kong?]

113
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:04,440
- You may get started.
- Should we go?

114
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:07,950
[Entering the safari.]

115
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:10,620
[What kind of missions are waiting
for them on the other side?]

116
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:16,360
[Even though the safari is usually done
while riding around in a car...]

117

[Running Man members will be doing
this mission on foot!]

118
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:23,170
[But, only white tiger Jong Kook
may go in a car.]

119
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:25,380
Why are you the only one
riding in a car?

120
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:29,590
- Sit down right here.
- What are you here, PD Myuk?

121
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:32,490
Good luck with the camel!
I have the flamingo.

[Gary's is the flamingo.]

123
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:38,300
[Come on... do you really think he was
given the mussel mission?]

124
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:40,930
What kind of a game do you think
he can play with mussels?

125
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,640
[A flamingo...]

126
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:46,500

makes their appearance.]

[Hello?]

129
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:58,760
Why did I have to get
the double-humped camels?

130
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,290
[Imitating them?]

131
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:06,320
Giraffe!

Giraffe!

136
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:20,950
[Running Man Giraffe meeting
the real giraffes.]

137
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:23,100
<i>You look like them.</i>

138
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:30,640
[Rhino]

139
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:38,940
[Even with their massive bodies,
they appear to be quite docile.]

140
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:43,320
I think there's something there.
It's a baby lion.

141
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,120
Why are you running?

142
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:51,700
[Baby lion, Ray,
born a mere 80 days ago!]

143
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:57,020
<i>Look at her running towards it
as we back away from it.</i>

144
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:01,360
What to do, what to do?
It's so cute!

145
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:05,170
- It's weird how much she likes it.
- Hello.

146
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:08,410
- Hello.
- Hi there!

147
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:12,310
Is it a baby lion?
Oh, I think I scared it. Sorry.

148
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,660
That's not a baby lion...

149
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:18,840
If you look at its eyes,
it's a full grown lion.

150
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,440
[Just staring at it while
keeping their distance from the lion.]

151
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:24,150
You poor thing.
Did I scare you? I'm so sorry.

152
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,970
[Saying their greetings while staying
far away from the animal.]

153
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:27,120
We have to go find the elephant.

154
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,410
It's staring at me.
Look at it!

155
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:32,910
Look at the way its claws
are standing out.

156
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:37,560
- Ji Hyo, we're leaving.
- Okay, go.

157
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:40,850
- I can't believe she's not scared.
- That's a full grown lion.

158
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:43,890
- Isn't that a full grown lion?
- That's a lion.

159
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:45,170
Hi.

160

[The only female member, Ji Hyo

Hi.
Don't be nervous.

162
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:55,100
It's an honor to meet you.

163
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:58,060
I can't believe I'm touching
a lion right now.

164
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,990
Isn't that Eun Ji Won?
Ji Won!

165
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:03,070
- What are you going to see?
- The elephant.

166
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:04,660
<i>The elephant is over this way.</i>

167
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:07,530
- The mission is no joke!
- What's the mission?

168
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:09,040
Jae Suk... Jae Suk.

169
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,880
Your mission could be having to pluck
a hair from the elephant or something.

170
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,790
[The mission is to pull the hair
off the elephant?]

171
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:16,140
- Ji Won's getting started on his rants.
- Pull the hair off an elephant?

172
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:18,230
- What is she doing?
- That's Ji Hyo.

173
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:21,420
Ji Hyo isn't afraid of any animals.

174
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:24,610
The lions are even leashed up,
and they're just roaming around.

175
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:26,870
- Really?
- The giraffes are just walking around.

176
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:29,250
- It really is the nature out here.
- It's like the amazon.

177
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:31,930
Lions are very sensitive.
We just met a young lion.

178
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:34,170
It's not the amazon, but Africa.

179
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:36,350
- Really?
- There are no lions in the amazon.

180
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,610
Why wouldn't there be lions
in the amazon?

181
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:40,460
- Where are there lions in the amazon?
- Have you seen it for yourself?

182
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:43,960
- This is Africa.
- Isn't the amazon a jungle too?

183
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:46,220
- You're driving me nuts.
- Aren't there lions in the jungle?

184
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:48,090
If it was just one of them,
I can attempt to explain.

185
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:50,570
But with all three of them together,
I have to repeat myself over and over.

186
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:53,050
- Amazons and jungles are the same thing.
- Isn't it the same thing?

187
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:56,300
[Lions exist in the amazon vs.
lions do not exist in the amazons.]

188
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:58,790
- They can't survive in the amazon.
- Have you seen it for yourself?

189
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:05,460
You don't know, you don't know...
you don't know about the amazon...

190
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:09,200
You don't know...
you're an idiot...

191
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,360
He says lions don't exist in the amazon.

192
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:15,670
[Just then, the car carrying Kkuk
makes its entrance.]

193
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,800
Are you trying to valet that thing?

194
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:21,800
- It says 'valet' on it.
- Valley!

195
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:24,400
- Can't you read?
- Seriously...

196
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:27,150
- It says 'valley' on it.
- That's not what it says!

197
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,280
- The door's open!
- Huh?

198
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,530
- This is open!
- I know!

199
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:34,400
- Let us come with you!
- Where are you going?

200
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:38,480
Look!
It's going in the water!

201
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,460
- That's so cool.
- It's turning into a boat.

202
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:45,180
[Wow... going in the water
just like that?]

203
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:52,180
What is this?
Why are we going in the water?

204
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:55,380
This is amazing!

205
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:58,030
- I can't believe that!
- Look, it's just going in the water!

206
00:10:58,030 --> 00:11:00,090
- Look at the way it's just going.
- I can't believe I'm seeing this.

207
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:04,780
<i>It just turned into a boat.</i>

208
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:08,320
- Wow... it turned into a boat.
- It's a boat now.

209
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:11,490
- Look at that thing.
- The car turned into a boat.

210
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:16,430
- Transformer!
- Jinx!

211
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,090
I said it too.
I'm serious.

212
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:20,250
- I swear, I said it too.
- The three of you think alike.

213
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:22,010
[His little brothers with like minds...]

214
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:25,140
To be the leader... of you three...

215
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:27,280
- Of us three?
- Say what?

216
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,920
What do you mean by that comment?

217
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:31,570
Seriously, you three...

218
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:36,130
It's a lion... it's a lion!

219
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:42,850
[At last... the white lions
are in front of his eyes!]

220
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:46,920
[Force]

221
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,910
[What?]

222
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:50,610
[What is that tiger doing here?]

223
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:53,890
The real scary thing is that someone
went in to install a camera in there.

224
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:56,240
Just who was it that went in there
to install that camera?

225
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,400
[While the lions were sleeping...]

226

<i>[If you can get all six of the lions to go
on top of the boulder, you succeed.]</i>

How can I get in there?

to get their attention...</i>

239

<i>and get a picture to prove that you did it
in order to succeed the mission.</i>

240
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:42,640
Can I throw something?
Maybe throw some food up there?

That's right... the king has to go up.

252

00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:07,730
[Is he giving up on his mission?]

338
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:13,850
[Gary's mission with the flamingos is?]

339
00:17:13,850 --> 00:17:16,820
Must take a picture of the flamingos as
seen in the picture. Where's the picture?

340
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,550
If you take a picture of them making
the heart shape, you succeed your mission.

341
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:23,000
So you want me to take a picture of
the flamingos in this stance?

342
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:27,510
Whether it's today, tomorrow,
or next year?

343
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:31,970
[As long as you get it done...]

344
00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:33,460
Do they have to be in love to do this?

345
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:36,380
Seriously... how am I supposed
to do that?

346
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:39,140
[Will they get into this pose for him?]

347
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:43,690
Don't you guys play the cookie stick game
amongst yourselves as a couple?

348
00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:44,960
Guys!

349
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:49,900
Okay... kiss time.

350
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:53,760
Starting now for the next minute...
it's kissing time.

351
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:57,540
[What's he saying?]

352
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:59,380
With your hearts open wide...

353
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,710
Everyone start loving on each other.

354
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:06,850
It's really big.

355
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:09,720
[Getting scared as the real giraffe
starts to approach him.]

356
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:11,820
No.

357
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:13,080
Come this way.

358
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,420
[Is he one of us?]

359
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:23,420
- What's with the tongue?
- It's way too close.

360
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:26,340
- The tongue...
- Giraffe!

361
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:29,640
[Shocked after seeing the length
of its tongue!]

362
00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:32,350
Kwang Soo, is your tongue like that too?

363
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:40,810
[Similar]

364
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:43,220
Do you want to eat this?

365
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:45,520
[It seems as though it wants
to eat some of the food on the table.]

366
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,210
Do I just feed it like this?

367
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:49,020
No, that's just the camera.

368
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:51,610
Camera.
Do you want a close shot?

369
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:55,010
[A huge snort.]

370
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:56,560
This is the first time I've ever seen
a real live giraffe.

371
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,000
This is your first time?

372
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:01,540
[You're that human giraffe?]

373
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:08,080
[Kwang Soo the Giraffe's mission is a
united 'O-X' quiz with the giraffes.]

374
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,390
[Kwang Soo's answer and the
giraffe's answer must match to pass.]

375
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:14,700
[Will Kwang Soo be able to find
consensus with the real giraffes?]

376
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:16,450
- Here's your first question.
- Okay.

377
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,940
<i>Lee Kwang Soo is handsome.</i>

378
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:22,200
[Lee Kwang Soo is handsome?]

379
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,140
[What the heck?
Chooses, yes, without even hesitating?]

380
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:25,450
Am I done?

381
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:28,960
Choose something that the giraffe likes
to eat as your answer.

382
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:32,050
Both of these are their favorite foods.

383
00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:34,540
Then I'll just offer the same stuff.

384
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:36,940
- That'll work.
- Right?

385
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:39,620
[If the giraffe chooses 'O', then he
succeeds the mission right away.]

386
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:41,650
There it is.
Ask the question.

387
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:44,860
<i>Lee Kwang Soo is handsome.</i>

388
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:45,880
[Heading straight to the 'O'?]

389
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,970
[Oh my...]

390
00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:53,570
[Fascinating...
Does he understand the question?]

391
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,970
- Fail.
- You should've chosen 'X'.

392
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:02,760
- I'm pretty alluring though.
- Alluring doesn't mean handsome.

393
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,120
I'm pretty handsome...

394
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:13,280
That lion needs to keep it down.
Giraffes may be sensitive because of the lion.

395
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:16,440
[The chief lion letting out
a ferocious roar.]

396
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:18,070
Simba!

397
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:22,790
[The white lion reacting to the lion herd
making their appearance in the next area.]

398
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:28,720
<i>What's wrong?</i>

399
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:32,030
<i>These guys are really angry.</i>

400
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:34,840
- Koshik!
- Everyone, be quiet!

401
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:37,330
- Come here!
- Giraffes are sensitive animals.

402
00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:39,170
- Come here, Koshik.
- You're being the loudest right now.

403
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:43,510
These guys are really angry.

404
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:44,840
[What's wrong with them?]

405
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,070
Simba!

406
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:48,630
[Finally heading towards the boulder...]

407
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:50,590
<i>Koshik, do you like flowers?</i>

408
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:51,820
Keep it down!

409
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:53,430
Koshik, do you like it?

410
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:55,580
[Koshik heading towards Jae Suk again.]

411
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:58,140
[Impersonating the zookeeper.]

412
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,650
I prepared something for you.
Koshik!

413
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:06,030
- What did you prepare? Tell me!
- I wasn't talking to you!

414
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:09,250
- What? What did you prepare?
- It's not for you! I wasn't talking to you.

415
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:10,900
Just what in the world is it?

416
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:15,390
Koshik? Do you like?
Do you like this?

417
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:22,050
Do you like? Do you like?
Koshik, do you like?

418
00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:24,370
Do you like? Do you like?
Koshik, do you like this?

419
00:21:24,370 --> 00:21:25,410
Like?

420
00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:28,310
Do you like?

421
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:30,840
Koshik, do you like?

422
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,790
[Reticent]

423
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:40,360
[Elephant show]

424
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:46,600
[What's he doing?]

425
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,980
Why are you looking at me like that?

426
00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:54,470
This is just a mission.

427
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:56,390
Why are you staring at me like that?

428
00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:58,770
Why are you looking at me like that
from behind the camera?

429
00:21:58,890 --> 00:22:01,450
I'll be really honest with you.

430
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:03,130
I'm here to film the show.

431
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:06,470
To be honest,
this is the first time I'm seeing you.

432
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:11,170
To be honest, I know that you only talk
when you're in the mood to talk

433
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:13,860
and I know that it's not something that you
like to do just because you're told to do it.

434
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:15,840
But... do it for me just this once.

435
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,330
Let's be cool here.
Koshik...

436
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:19,050
Do you like?

437
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:20,650
Hey!

438
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:24,770
[Blank Ji is getting to know
the baby lion, Ray.]

439
00:22:24,770 --> 00:22:27,180
- Ray...
- He's a little nervous.

440
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,210
So lions can get nervous too?

441
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:31,840
Ray...

442
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:35,370
- He's calmed down though.
- He seems much calmer.

443
00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:37,130
Ray...

444
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:40,260
[Even giving him his bottle
in an attempt to get closer to him.]

445
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:46,020
You have to be cautious.
Don't scare him.

446
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:49,460
[Snuggling into Blank Ji's embrace.]

447
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:51,140
Hi, Ray.

448
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:55,460
[Blank Ji is carrying out her mission.]

449
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:01,450
[Attempting to carry out his mission
with his jumping skills.]

450
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:05,410
[Dissed by the double-humped camels?]

451
00:23:10,330 --> 00:23:11,880
[What is he doing?]

452
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:16,530
[The two camels making
Big-nosed Brother sweat it out.]

453
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:18,660
[Not quite the illusion of being
on top of the camels...]

454
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:21,400
[Weak jumping skills...]

455
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,870
[Blank Ji attempting her mission.]

456
00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:29,510
[If the baby lion, Ray runs over
to Blank Ji, she succeeds her mission.]

457
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:32,560
[Having come to much friendlier terms,
will he go straight to Blank Ji?]

458
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,820
[Oh!]

459
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,770
[Wow! Right into Blank Ji's embrace!]

460
00:23:42,770 --> 00:23:44,720
[Blank Ji succeeds her mission!]

461
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:51,330
- Thank you.
- You've succeeded your mission.

462
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:56,490
['R' sticker as a proof of her success.]

463
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,580
Kwang Soo!
Kwang Soo!

464
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:08,920
Is Kwang Soo ugly?
That's right, he's ugly.

465
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,350
What are you doing?

466
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:13,760
[Giraffe readily accepting it as if
it understands her question.]

467
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,290
He is ugly or handsome?

468
00:24:15,290 --> 00:24:17,420
[Again, readily accepting
at the mention of ugly.]

469
00:24:19,050 --> 00:24:20,880
- What are they doing?
- Hang on.

470
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,400
Look at them run.

471
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:25,490
- They really do run like me.
- They look just like you when you run.

472
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:27,770
[Immediately imitating them?]

473
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:32,530
[Possessed by the giraffes' spirit?]

474
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:36,160
<i>You really...
you really do look like them.</i>

475
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,250
<i>Lee Kwang Soo is afraid of the tiger.</i>

476
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:41,990
Afraid of the tiger?

477
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:43,760
Yes, I'm afraid of the tiger.

478
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,870
[Chooses the 'O' again.]

479
00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:50,440
[Giraffe has to eat from his
left hand to win the mission.]

480
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:53,690
[Going to the opposite side
without hesitation.]

481
00:24:53,690 --> 00:24:55,710
Please... please!

482
00:24:55,710 --> 00:24:58,600
[Pulling the food back away from him,
and re-attempting the mission.]

483
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:03,430
[Please eat from the left.]

484
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:06,840
No, no!

485
00:25:07,810 --> 00:25:11,090
[The right hand must appear to be tastier...]

486
00:25:11,090 --> 00:25:13,230
He ate from the wrong hand!

487
00:25:18,770 --> 00:25:20,880
Koshik... do you like?

488
00:25:21,810 --> 00:25:23,730
How are you feeling?
You feeling okay?

489
00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:26,890
Are you not feeling good?
So-so?

490
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:29,070
Tired?

491
00:25:29,610 --> 00:25:31,090
Koshik, are you okay?

492
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:33,870
- What's okay?
- Are you done?

493
00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:36,870
- No.
- Koshik can say, 'like'.

494
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:39,150
- Really?
- I think I saw it on TV.

495
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,590
Do you like?

496
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:44,930
[Barging in to intrude on
someone else's mission.]

497
00:25:44,930 --> 00:25:47,530
He's not even muttering a sound.
Are you sure this one is Koshik?

498
00:25:47,530 --> 00:25:48,810
Do you like?

499
00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:52,510
Do you like?

500
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,740
[Oh!]

501
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:58,470
<i>Like.</i>

502
00:25:58,470 --> 00:26:00,540
[Koshik spoke!]

503
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:02,300
- He said it!
- He did it!

504
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:05,220
- Eun Ji Won did it.
- Why did you do that?

505
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:07,840
I heard he only speaks once a year.

506
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:11,310
[How could silent Koshik...]

507
00:26:11,850 --> 00:26:13,800
Koshik, do you like?

508
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,330
How did you do it?
How did you do it?

509
00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:16,940
Do you like?
Do you like?

510
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:18,530
Do you like?

511
00:26:18,930 --> 00:26:20,400
Koshik, do you like?

512
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,820
<i>Like.</i>

513
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:25,170
[He spoke again!]

514
00:26:25,170 --> 00:26:26,910
He speaks!

515
00:26:26,910 --> 00:26:28,950
Koshik can speak!

516
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:32,130
This is...
Here, Koshik! Eat this!

517
00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:34,530
Koshik!
Have some treats!

518
00:26:34,530 --> 00:26:37,210
Koshik, do you like it even with the peel?

519
00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:39,140
- Koshik, do you like it?
- Like.

520
00:26:39,150 --> 00:26:40,500
[Like]

521
00:26:41,570 --> 00:26:44,170
Hey... he really can speak.

522
00:26:45,850 --> 00:26:48,600
[Succeeds his mission thanks to Ji Won
who came over out of boredom.]

523
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,030
Koshik finally opened his mouth.
Koshik!

524
00:26:52,030 --> 00:26:53,600
Thanks, Koshik!

525
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:56,160
Koshik, do you like bananas?

526
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,550
<i>No, I don't like it!</i>

527
00:26:58,140 --> 00:26:59,420
<i>No, I don't like it!</i>

528
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:01,130
[The tiger speaks again...]

529
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:03,230
- I said, I don't like it!
- Hey, muscles!

530
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:04,770
- I hate it!
- You don't like it?

531
00:27:04,770 --> 00:27:05,910
I hate it!

532
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:08,040
- Muscles, you don't like it?
- I said, I hate it!

533
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:10,680
- Muscles says he doesn't like it.
- What is he doing?

534
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,270
Muscles has to get all six of
them to go up on the boulder.

535
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:13,680
- Guys!
- All six of them.

536
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:16,780
[All of the white lions are enjoying
their own free time.]

537
00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:19,940
Simba, you're killing me.

538
00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:22,440
Simba, this is too hard.

539
00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:25,540
[Not even acknowledging what
the tiger is saying.]

540
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:32,920
[Is he trying to speak in
the lion's language?]

541
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:36,650
This is what you call, rapport.

542
00:27:36,650 --> 00:27:37,970
Take a good look, okay?

543
00:27:37,970 --> 00:27:42,340
[Boasting after barely squeaking by
to pass his mission.]

544
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:44,100
Pay attention, Koshik.

545
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,020
[Is he trying to get Koshik to
say a different word?]

546
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:48,410
Lay down.
Lay down, Koshik.

547
00:27:48,410 --> 00:27:51,730
Lay down!

548
00:27:51,730 --> 00:27:54,160
[Oh?]

549
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,880
- Lay down!
- Lay down.

550
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:57,530
He said it!

551
00:27:57,530 --> 00:27:59,320
[Great job!
He spoke again!]

552
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:01,300
I'm going to go insane here!

553
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:05,580
Koshik, you're so good!
Thanks so much, Koshik!

554
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:09,540
Tauros!

555
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,660
[Finally starting to call him
by the right name.]

556
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:14,230
- Get down!
- Tauros!

557
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:16,530
- Get down!
- Get up there!

558
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,630
[Starting to hinder the tiger as soon as
he completes his own mission.]

559
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:20,870
- Four of them are up there!
- Come down from there!

560
00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:22,530
- Tauros!
- Come down!

561
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:25,040
- Get down!
- Tauros!

562
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:28,090
<i>Tauros!
Tauros, get up there!</i>

563
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:31,640
- Why don't you get up there too?
- These guys keeps looking up there!

564
00:28:32,690 --> 00:28:34,360
[What did you say?]

565
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:35,870
What?
You suddenly can't talk?

566
00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:37,970
[Tiger starting to get extremely annoyed.]

567
00:28:37,970 --> 00:28:39,410
Don't you know how to talk?

568
00:28:39,410 --> 00:28:41,000
Go away!

569
00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:44,020
Get away from there!

570
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,370
[What are those two doing?]

571
00:28:50,470 --> 00:28:52,650
Seriously... what temper.

572
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:57,060
[Goal is six. There are
currently four on the boulder.]

573
00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:01,150
[Emergency weapon?
Pulling out the raw chicken.]

574
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:10,450
[Huh? Is it food?]

575
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:14,530
[Will he be able to throw it
up onto the boulder?]

576
00:29:18,970 --> 00:29:21,580
[Um...]

577
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,980
Sorry guys!

578
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:28,420
[Is he trying to tease us?]

579
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,590
[Making another attempt.]

580
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:35,680
[Right under the boulder.]

581
00:29:37,530 --> 00:29:40,570
[Uh... it's stepping down.]

582
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:46,970
[If anything, his bad throw is causing
them to step down.]

583
00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:52,120
You should eat in a comfortable position.
Go on up there.

584
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,760
[What?
Five on the boulder now?]

585
00:29:53,770 --> 00:29:56,180
Another one stepped up there!

586
00:29:56,190 --> 00:29:58,250
Wait, I need two more.

587
00:29:58,950 --> 00:30:00,800
[Interested?]

588
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:03,510
Look at them.
They're finally showing some interest.

589
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:05,320
[White lions showing some interest
with the food in his hand.]

590
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:08,630
You're the only one left.
You just need to step up there.

591
00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:10,680
Just you.
You just have to step up there!

592
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:13,700
[Misses his throw again.]

593
00:30:14,570 --> 00:30:16,250
You!
Get on up there!

594
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:20,340
[They're lions. Not even
paying attention to the tiger...]

595
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:22,140
Why aren't you going up there?
Go up there.

596
00:30:23,370 --> 00:30:26,020
[A long distance to throw
on top of the boulder.]

597
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:28,990
I'm seriously about to lose my mind.

598
00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:35,720
[Keeps missing his throws.]

599
00:30:36,330 --> 00:30:38,390
Since you've had enough to eat,
I want you to listen to me.

600
00:30:38,390 --> 00:30:39,470
Get up there.

601
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:43,450
[Is it getting up because of
what it heard?]

602
00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:44,860
Get up there.

603
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:46,330
I want you to get up there.

604
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:49,880
[Four of them are staying up there...]

605
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:52,750
Get up there.
I just need you to get up there.

606
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:54,120
Where are you going?

607
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:57,460
Where are you going after all
you've eaten? Get up there!

608
00:30:57,460 --> 00:31:00,140
[It's going up!]

609
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:01,900
[It went up!]

610
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:05,660
It went up.
Okay, hang on.

611
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:08,100
[Now if this one last lion will go up...]

612
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:11,050
Get up.
You're the only one left to go up.

613
00:31:11,050 --> 00:31:12,790
[Continuing to talk to convince the
lion to get up on the boulder.]

614
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:14,580
You're the only one left.
We can end this battle if you go up.

615
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:17,080
Go up there.

616
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:18,650
There you go.

617
00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:21,510
Hurry up and get up there.
There you go! Get up there!

618
00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:22,770
Get up there!

619
00:31:22,770 --> 00:31:25,340
There you go!
Get up there!

620
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:27,970
[Oh?]

621
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:30,030
Get up there!
Get your hind legs up there!

622
00:31:30,270 --> 00:31:32,240
You have to get your hind
legs up there!

623
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,990
Your hind legs!

624
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:36,520
Jump up there!
What are you doing?

625
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,180
What's wrong with you?

626
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:40,130
Just get up there!

627
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:43,030
[Why does the heli-camera have to
come up right at this moment?]

628
00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:45,330
Get down here, camera!

629
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:47,170
Camera, get down!

630
00:31:47,170 --> 00:31:49,700
[This moment when only the hind legs
needs to get up on the boulder...]

631
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:52,010
Why is that camera moving right now?

632
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:54,890
[What is that?]

633
00:31:55,410 --> 00:31:56,960
Get down!

634
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,770
Lower the camera!

635
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:01,690
Why did you bring that up?

636
00:32:01,690 --> 00:32:03,470
That one is about to go up!
Go up!

637
00:32:03,470 --> 00:32:05,330
Get up!
It's going up!

638
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:08,600
[It's going up?]

639
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:11,920
[The hind legs are finally...]

640
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:15,840
[How can this be!]

641
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:19,870
[All six of the white lions are
on top of the boulder!]

642
00:32:19,870 --> 00:32:21,760
It's up there!
It went up!

643
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,560
It went up!
There you go!

644
00:32:26,890 --> 00:32:28,230
See?
They're all up there.

645
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:35,150
[The battle of will between the tiger
and the lions is finally over.]

646
00:32:35,150 --> 00:32:36,570
Success.

647
00:32:38,910 --> 00:32:41,080
That was way too hard.

648
00:32:41,970 --> 00:32:44,500
I, Lee Kwang Soo am smarter
than Eun Ji Won.

649
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:46,010
Yes, or no.

650
00:32:46,770 --> 00:32:49,910
[It needs to eat from
the 'O' hand to succeed.]

651
00:32:51,210 --> 00:32:53,710
[The opposite again...]

652
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:59,950
[Making another attempt]

653
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:04,600
[Undeterred and going back to the 'X'.]

654
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:08,770
You're never going to get it.

655
00:33:08,770 --> 00:33:10,670
Eat this one.

656
00:33:10,670 --> 00:33:12,770
Kwang Soo, it ate the 'X'.

657
00:33:15,150 --> 00:33:17,200
[Showing us their mutual
liking for each other?]

658
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:21,200
- Are you really...
- He's really become one of them.

659
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:24,220
- That's insane.
- He's not joking around.

660
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:26,610
He's become a real giraffe now.

661
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:29,970
I didn't know I'd go this far either!

662
00:33:29,970 --> 00:33:31,500
I really didn't want to go that far!

663
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:34,650
[His affection with the giraffe
throwing everyone in for a loop.]

664
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:41,210
[Oh my...]

665
00:33:42,570 --> 00:33:44,600
Even the giraffe is shocked!

666
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:47,550
[Giraffe kiss]

667
00:33:53,610 --> 00:33:54,710
[Delicious]

668
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:04,330
- Your nickname was righteously given.
- Thank you.

669
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:06,720
Give me the next question.

670
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:12,070
[Correctly guess the three foods that
the rhinos really like.]

671
00:34:12,070 --> 00:34:13,740
Here, this is delicious.

672
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:17,520
[Trying out the banana first.]

673
00:34:18,330 --> 00:34:19,980
There you go.

674
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,700
[It really likes it!]

675
00:34:31,050 --> 00:34:32,580
Sweet potato!

676
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:35,740
Sweet potato, banana, and carrots.

677
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:37,840
<i>Wrong.</i>

678
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:43,900
Guys!

679
00:34:45,590 --> 00:34:47,520
Let's just get it over with, okay?

680
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,360
What's the problem?

681
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:52,850
Let's kiss!

682
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:55,180
It's okay.

683
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:56,910
I'll pretend I didn't see it.

684
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:06,790
I think I got it.

685
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:11,140
[Did he finally succeed in shooting
a heart pose?]

686
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:16,780
[Oh... in the middle?]

687
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:19,300
[Shape of a heart.]

688
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:20,820
Success?
Success?

689
00:35:23,370 --> 00:35:24,810
Thanks, my friends!

690
00:35:24,810 --> 00:35:26,050
I'm leaving!

691
00:35:26,050 --> 00:35:28,020
Keep loving each other!

692
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:31,820
Love isn't easy.

693
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,130
Come here, come here!

694
00:35:35,130 --> 00:35:38,060
[The giraffe must eat from
the 'O' hand to succeed...]

695
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:40,040
[Will it happen this time?]

696
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:44,730
[What got into him?
He's heading to the 'O'!]

697
00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:46,110
Success!

698
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:51,250
[Is this what consensus is all about?]

699
00:35:51,250 --> 00:35:52,660
You did good.
Good job.

700
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,580
Success.

701
00:35:57,980 --> 00:36:00,930
[Earns the 'R' sticker as a sign
of having succeeded his mission.]

702
00:36:02,530 --> 00:36:04,580
[What is Ji Won's mission?]

703
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:11,460
<i>[If at least three giraffes stay in the
camera shot for five seconds to succeed.]</i>

704
00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:15,470
[Will he be able to succeed in his mission?]

705
00:36:19,970 --> 00:36:21,640
You can't really see the shot.

706
00:36:21,990 --> 00:36:24,190
[Giraffes slowly starting to
come into the shot.]

707
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:26,220
- There they are,
- Right now is your chance.

708
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,610
The Rose of Sharon is blooming...
you stay right there!

709
00:36:30,610 --> 00:36:32,350
That's the perfect model pose!

710
00:36:33,470 --> 00:36:35,550
[One giraffe standing motionless.]

711
00:36:35,550 --> 00:36:37,450
- I think you can do it.
- You stay just like that.

712
00:36:37,450 --> 00:36:38,910
Just stay right there.

713
00:36:38,910 --> 00:36:40,250
Why is that one running around?

714
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,630
[You think it'd be that easy?]

715
00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:45,100
We're going to start this game, okay?

716
00:36:48,230 --> 00:36:51,430
'The rose of sharon is blooming.'

717
00:36:56,270 --> 00:36:58,200
That one just won't stop
running around.

718
00:36:59,270 --> 00:37:00,860
<i>You failed.</i>

719
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:03,590
- Right now. Right now is your chance.
- Do it right now.

720
00:37:03,870 --> 00:37:06,380
The rose of sharon is blooming!

721
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:10,890
One, two, three, four...
Four of them.

722
00:37:10,890 --> 00:37:12,130
[Huh?]

723
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:14,680
Hey! What are you doing?
Stop doing that.

724
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:15,930
[The human giraffe confusing
the other giraffes.]

725
00:37:15,930 --> 00:37:17,430
Is he allowed to do this?

726
00:37:17,950 --> 00:37:20,500
- Is he allowed to obstruct like this?
- This is obstruction?

727
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:23,440
- What were you doing then?
- I was just running because I was happy.

728
00:37:24,490 --> 00:37:27,580
Seriously... I almost had it!

729
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:30,290
The sooner you succeed your mission,
the worse it is for me.

730
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:31,690
Why?

731
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:34,820
Because it took me so long for mine,
there will be too great of a difference.

732
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:37,550
Stop lying!
Are you just trying to get in my way?

733
00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:42,260
- You don't have to go that far.
- You're always changing the story!

734
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:45,350
- I'm not changing the story.
- And what is that? It's too noisy!

735
00:37:45,350 --> 00:37:47,510
It has to film us.

736
00:37:47,510 --> 00:37:50,060
Now is the chance.
It's the perfect chance.

737
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:52,100
Everyone to the back.

738
00:37:52,110 --> 00:37:54,200
I don't know.
What do you think?

739
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:57,590
- How did it go? Are you done?
- Ugh, it's him!

740
00:37:57,590 --> 00:38:00,080
- Are you done?
- Why are there so many people around?

741
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:02,640
Why are there so many
Lee Kwang Soo's around?

742
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:05,760
Please keep it down.
You're ruining my mission!

743
00:38:06,270 --> 00:38:08,220
If you're done, then just leave!

744
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:09,950
Guys!

745
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:12,200
What?

746
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:14,090
[Huh?]

747
00:38:14,090 --> 00:38:15,610
Eat.

748
00:38:15,610 --> 00:38:17,450
- Seriously...
- Eat this.

749
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:19,740
Get away!

750
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:21,920
What's wrong with his temper?

751
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:24,090
I said, get away from me.

752
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:28,980
[Another attempt]

753
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:30,780
Rose of sharon is blooming!

754
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:35,530
All three of them are the screen.
This is the chance!

755
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,520
[Huh?]

756
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:43,620
Hey... hey!
I seriously don't hit people like this.

757
00:38:44,050 --> 00:38:46,390
I'm trying to help you right now.

758
00:38:47,130 --> 00:38:50,260
Wait. Isn't it a success whether
he's in the shot or not?

759
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:52,750
[Including Kwang Soo?]

760
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:57,190
[His plan is to include the human giraffe,
Kwang Soo in the mission as well.]

761
00:38:57,190 --> 00:39:00,390
- Then you're saying I'm one of them?
- You're just like these giraffes.

762
00:39:00,390 --> 00:39:02,250
Even your coloring is similar.

763
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:04,150
I'll get you in there.

764
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:06,760
Why don't you get in the shot?
Come on, get in.

765
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:07,910
[The human giraffe is ultimately
included in the shot.]

766
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:13,940
- You stay right there.
- They're looking at me.

767
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:18,950
[Oh? It is staring at Kwang Soo.]

768
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:23,140
[Is this the human giraffe and
the real giraffe communication?]

769
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:30,120
[Attempt to succeed the challenge with
Kwang Soo as one of the giraffes.]

770
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:32,370
That one is staring at Kwang Soo
without even moving.

771
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:36,340
See that one?
The one staring at Kwang Soo?

772
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:39,130
The rose of sharon is blooming!

773
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:43,140
[Will he succeed?]

774
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:49,450
One, two, three, four, five...
succeed!

775
00:39:49,450 --> 00:39:51,090
[Success]

776
00:39:52,050 --> 00:39:54,330
[Ji Won's plan is a success!]

777
00:39:54,330 --> 00:39:56,510
Kwang Soo!
I succeeded with you in there!

778
00:39:57,930 --> 00:40:00,870
[Even human giraffe Kwang Soo
is fascinated...]

779
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,980
It's just staring at you.

780
00:40:02,990 --> 00:40:06,170
I'm seriously!
You are totally staring at each other.

781
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:07,890
[The giraffe stepping closer to
be closer to Kwang Soo...]

782
00:40:09,330 --> 00:40:12,230
[Gazes locked.]

783
00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:14,380
Even though we're going
our separate ways right now...

784
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:16,750
I'm never going to forget you.

785
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:18,130
[This is really fascinating?]

786
00:40:18,170 --> 00:40:21,720
That really is heartbreaking.
That really is sad.

787
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:23,340
Please...

788
00:40:24,110 --> 00:40:26,230
[Eyes transfixed]

789
00:40:27,370 --> 00:40:29,820
- This is a beautiful scene.
- Juliet...

790
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:32,420
- Its almost trying to communicate with you.
- Is this a love triangle?

791
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:34,020
Is this really a love triangle?

792
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:36,530
[Why is it suddenly being turned
into a love triangle?]

793
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:41,340
[Human giraffes and two real giraffe's
love triangle.]

794
00:40:42,310 --> 00:40:44,900
[Kwang Soo's seduction.]

795
00:40:49,590 --> 00:40:53,690
[That human giraffe Kwang Soo,
having communicated deeply with the giraffe.]

796
00:40:53,690 --> 00:40:57,280
[But with the sudden appearance
of another giraffe...]

797
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,900
[A love triangle surrounding Kwang Soo
starts here and now...]

798
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:02,670
[That result...]

799
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:05,570
[means that the first love
didn't come true?]

800
00:41:06,250 --> 00:41:08,310
[Don't go!]

801
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:12,000
No!

802
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:15,260
No!

803
00:41:17,890 --> 00:41:20,570
[Kwang Soo's seduction. The end.]

804
00:41:21,390 --> 00:41:24,340
Anyways, thanks, Kwang Soo.
I succeeded the mission thanks to you.

805
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:30,970
I can't believe it's still
staring at Kwang Soo like that.

806
00:41:30,970 --> 00:41:34,710
- It's still staring at me.
- I think even the giraffes are fascinated.

807
00:41:34,710 --> 00:41:37,700
To see another creature that looks
so much like themselves.

808
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:42,130
[It seems as though his jumping skills
may have improved somewhat.]

809
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:45,580
[He's sitting!]

810
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:47,950
[Success!]

811
00:41:47,950 --> 00:41:49,730
Thank you, guys!

812
00:41:49,730 --> 00:41:52,940
He's already eaten several apples.

813
00:41:53,370 --> 00:41:56,070
Apples, carrot, and bananas.

814
00:41:56,070 --> 00:41:57,690
That's correct.

815
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:06,860
[Everyone succeeds their safari mission.]

816
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:12,050
[Second mission - Animal Kingdom.]

817
00:42:12,050 --> 00:42:14,530
[Battle of knowledge.]

818
00:42:14,530 --> 00:42:15,860
I'm in trouble.

819
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:18,250
Jessica says she's in trouble.

820
00:42:19,350 --> 00:42:24,910
<i>Okay, this quiz will be about the knowledge
that you already have yourselves.</i>

821
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:26,710
- Ah...
- Ourselves?

822
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:31,090
<i>The game will be played one on one and
the last one left remaining is the winner.</i>

823
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:35,560
<i>Rules will be explained to you in more detail
once you first each ask your questions.</i>

824
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:38,100
So a question of our own knowledge?

825
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:39,790
Do I have to know the answer to it?

826
00:42:39,790 --> 00:42:41,660
Isn't that just a given?

827
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:45,150
- Of course, you have to know.
- You have to know that to win.

828
00:42:45,150 --> 00:42:48,020
What's the need to know the answer?
Can't you just ask the question?

829
00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:52,780
[Just like mentioned,
this is a battle of their own smarts!]

830
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:56,270
I think I should ask something about
current events right now.

831
00:42:56,270 --> 00:42:58,680
Jae Suk... that's not fair!

832
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:00,660
You're just trying to win by yourself.

833
00:43:01,670 --> 00:43:04,810
Wow... it's hard to even come up with
a question when you don't know anything.

834
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:08,190
I can't ask anything about
my family, right?

835
00:43:08,190 --> 00:43:10,160
[Of course not.]

836
00:43:13,430 --> 00:43:14,860
Okay!

837
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:15,970
I'm done.

838
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:21,110
[The group completes coming up
with their own questions.]

839
00:43:21,110 --> 00:43:25,400
- You nine animals yourselves...
- What do you mean, animals?

840
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:27,630
You're being too harsh with your words.

841
00:43:27,630 --> 00:43:30,710
<i>Then the nine of you...</i>

842
00:43:30,710 --> 00:43:35,230
<i>First, one animal will step forward...</i>

843
00:43:35,230 --> 00:43:37,280
<i>and ask their question.</i>

844
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:42,250
[Privilege of first round's winner, Blank Ji-
Determine the order of questions asked.]

845
00:43:42,250 --> 00:43:46,090
What is the name of this one special fruit
that lions, tigers and other carnivores likes?

846
00:43:46,090 --> 00:43:50,670
- Ah! That one?
- The fruit that carnivores likes?

847
00:43:50,670 --> 00:43:57,520
[Members standing in the back have to
write the answer down on a sketchbook.]

848
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:06,140
[And the person asking the question will
choose the person who won't know the answer.]

849
00:44:06,140 --> 00:44:07,620
Kang Gary, come out here!

850
00:44:07,620 --> 00:44:12,990
<i>If the person you picked correctly answers,
then the questioner will be shot with water.</i>

851
00:44:12,990 --> 00:44:20,770
[But if the person you picked gets it wrong,
then that person is eliminated.]

852
00:44:20,770 --> 00:44:22,700
Please don't do this!

853
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:28,930
[The last person left remaining
is the final winner of the game.]

854
00:44:33,030 --> 00:44:35,210
[Big-nosed Brother and Gary
are the first two to be eliminated.]

855
00:44:35,210 --> 00:44:37,280
This is bad.
My problem is really easy.

856
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:40,350
This is trouble.
My question is way too easy.

857
00:44:40,350 --> 00:44:41,850
- Here we go.
- I'm really in trouble.

858
00:44:41,850 --> 00:44:44,850
- What's the question?
- My question is way too easy.

859
00:44:44,850 --> 00:44:48,340
- Give us an easy question then.
- I really am in trouble.

860
00:44:48,830 --> 00:44:50,260
Okay...

861
00:44:52,430 --> 00:44:54,970
- My brother, Ji Sung...
- What?

862
00:44:54,970 --> 00:44:59,310
[Korea's eternal captain of soccer,
Park Ji sung is his brother?]

863
00:44:59,310 --> 00:45:00,950
Don't you know who my
brother Ji Sung is?

864
00:45:00,950 --> 00:45:02,890
- Are you referring to Park Ji Sung?
- Yes, he is.

865
00:45:02,890 --> 00:45:05,460
I'm worried that you'll all know
the answer because it's about Ji Sung.

866
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:07,800
My brother, Ji Sung...

867
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:12,310
Which domestic neighborhood did he score
his first goal at the nationals competition in?

868
00:45:12,310 --> 00:45:13,980
- What?
- His first goal.

869
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:16,670
- Neighborhood? You want the neighborhood?
- Yes.

870
00:45:16,670 --> 00:45:18,820
Name the area.

871
00:45:20,820 --> 00:45:24,040
- The arena where he scored his first goal.
- Wait...

872
00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:26,420
When he was in the K leagues?

873
00:45:27,590 --> 00:45:30,720
[He just said that it was
a nationals game...]

874
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:33,270
Kwang Soo doesn't know.
Kwang Soo doesn't know the answer.

875
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,500
- I don't think I know this.
- The stuff we say...

876
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:39,190
it could be a big hint to Jong Kook.

877
00:45:39,190 --> 00:45:40,880
[Blank...]

878
00:45:41,830 --> 00:45:43,770
The two ladies are spaced out right now.

879
00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:45,880
You can't share your answers
with anyone.

880
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:46,990
[A difficult questions for the ladies.]

881
00:45:53,650 --> 00:45:55,670
- Why is your answer so long, Ji Won?
- What?

882
00:45:55,670 --> 00:45:58,620
No, I was just drawing something
next to it too.

883
00:45:58,620 --> 00:46:01,000
The way I see it right now,
there are two candidates right now.

884
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,050
Who?

885
00:46:02,050 --> 00:46:03,670
Lee Kwang Soo and Eun Ji Won.

886
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:08,310
[Two most likely candidates.]

887
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:12,600
Even though I'm sure the ladies don't know
this either, it's too unfair to them.

888
00:46:13,330 --> 00:46:15,980
That's why you should attack them more!
What are you saying?

889
00:46:15,980 --> 00:46:17,680
It's either Eun Ji Won or
Lee Kwang Soo.

890
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:19,450
[Thank goodness...]

891
00:46:19,450 --> 00:46:21,260
You shouldn't be doing this, Jong Kook!

892
00:46:21,260 --> 00:46:22,700
You should pick the giraffe.

893
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:25,560
[Everyone if trying to get
Jong Kook to choose the giraffe.]

894
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:29,230
- You should pick Ji Won!
- Lee Kwang Soo!

895
00:46:29,230 --> 00:46:32,060
[Giraffe it is!]

896
00:46:32,060 --> 00:46:33,710
- There you go!
- We're good!

897
00:46:33,710 --> 00:46:35,950
- This is perfect.
- Kwang Soo is eliminated.

898
00:46:35,950 --> 00:46:37,250
We did it.

899
00:46:38,140 --> 00:46:41,720
[If the giraffe gets the answer right,
then the tiger will get soaked.]

900
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:46,360
[If the giraffe wrote down the wrong answer,
then he himself will get soaked!]

901
00:46:49,410 --> 00:46:52,870
[Time to reveal the answer the chosen
giraffe had written down.]

902
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:58,400
[Suwon.]

903
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:00,130
- I think he's right.
- I think he got it right.

904
00:47:00,140 --> 00:47:02,430
<i>Please reveal your answer.</i>

905
00:47:02,430 --> 00:47:04,810
[Questioner, Jong Kook to
reveal the answer.]

906
00:47:04,810 --> 00:47:06,330
What is it?
What happened?

907
00:47:06,330 --> 00:47:10,270
- We're the only ones who know right now.
- What happened?

908
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:12,790
I felt a water drop!
I swore I felt something!

909
00:47:12,790 --> 00:47:16,270
- What's going on here?
- Who won?

910
00:47:16,970 --> 00:47:23,140
[If what giraffe wrote down is right,
it's the tiger. If not, it's the giraffe.]

911
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:25,670
- Kwang Soo!
- What's going on?

912
00:47:25,670 --> 00:47:27,280
[Is Suwon the correct answer?]

913
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:29,780
Kwang Soo... Kwang Soo!

914
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:34,910
[Time to reveal the answer
the question Tiger wrote down.]

915
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:39,170
[Suwon]

916
00:47:45,140 --> 00:47:47,550
[Miracle! Giraffe answers correctly!]

917
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:00,080
Park Ji Sung!
Park Ji Sung!

918
00:48:00,090 --> 00:48:02,890
[Wow... Giraffe knew the answer!]

919
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:05,800
[Tiger is eliminated.]

920
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:09,610
- I can't believe Kwang Soo won.
- So this is how Kwang Soo survives?

921
00:48:10,940 --> 00:48:12,950
I can't believe Lee Kwang Soo survived.

922
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:16,980
[Recharging the water cannon.]

923
00:48:16,990 --> 00:48:20,070
- I'll go this time.
- Ji Won's question is hard.

924
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:24,350
- Ji Won't question is really hard.
- I didn't say what it is.

925
00:48:24,350 --> 00:48:27,980
Ji Won is a little random,
but he said his IQ is like 200.

926
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:30,470
He knows the most random questions.

927
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:33,840
It's a question that more than 70% of
Seoul University students don't even know.

928
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:36,490
[A question 70% of the Seoul University
students don't know the answer to?]

929
00:48:36,490 --> 00:48:38,690
I'm not a student of Seoul University!

930
00:48:38,690 --> 00:48:40,670
You have to answer it within 30 seconds.

931
00:48:40,670 --> 00:48:44,280
70% of Seoul University students
really don't know the answer to this?

932
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:47,820
- Yes, that is a fact.
- Then it's too hard. How would we know?

933
00:48:47,820 --> 00:48:49,610
But I know it!

934
00:48:49,970 --> 00:48:52,540
[The question being asked is up
to the person asking the question.]

935
00:48:52,540 --> 00:48:54,540
- Good job! Ask whatever you want!
- You show them!

936
00:48:54,540 --> 00:48:55,970
Here's the question!

937
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:58,680
Take a look at this picture...

938
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:00,430
and then solve the question.

939
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:02,580
Okay, here's the question.

940
00:49:02,580 --> 00:49:05,090
Divide into three equal parts!

941
00:49:05,090 --> 00:49:07,690
Divide it into three equal parts!

942
00:49:07,690 --> 00:49:08,940
[Divide this into three parts?]

943
00:49:10,990 --> 00:49:16,580
[Divide this shape into equal three parts.]

944
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:20,510
I'm not good at things like this.

945
00:49:24,690 --> 00:49:27,010
- Okay!
- I know this. I've seen it on the internet.

946
00:49:27,670 --> 00:49:30,590
I think I've seen this before.

947
00:49:31,670 --> 00:49:35,710
[Is everyone pretending to know in
efforts to avoid Ji Won's suspicion?]

948
00:49:36,590 --> 00:49:38,010
Everyone finished?

949
00:49:38,010 --> 00:49:39,770
Is everyone done?

950
00:49:40,770 --> 00:49:43,110
[30 seconds is over.]

951
00:49:43,110 --> 00:49:44,700
I think at least one person
is going to get the correct answer.

952
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:47,060
<i>You can't keep doing it, Kwang Soo.</i>

953
00:49:47,060 --> 00:49:49,190
- Lee Kwang Soo!
- I was doing something else.

954
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:53,330
Kwang Soo!
Kwang Soo, come up here!

955
00:49:53,330 --> 00:49:56,130
[Giraffe is chosen for
the second time in a row.]

956
00:49:56,130 --> 00:50:00,260
<i>Lee Kwang Soo!
Lee Kwang Soo!</i>

957
00:50:00,260 --> 00:50:02,020
Why do I have to go again
when I was just up there?

958
00:50:02,020 --> 00:50:05,790
This guy will do whatever
for the sake of our program.

959
00:50:05,790 --> 00:50:07,640
This friend can do it.

960
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:11,020
[What kind of three parts did he
divide it into?]

961
00:50:11,020 --> 00:50:12,500
Is it really me?

962
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:19,850
[If the Giraffe gets it right,
then it's the panda getting soaked!]

963
00:50:19,860 --> 00:50:21,610
What?
You knew the question?

964
00:50:21,610 --> 00:50:23,350
I really know.
I really know this answer.

965
00:50:23,350 --> 00:50:27,170
This time, Eun Ji Won will
reveal the answer first.

966
00:50:27,170 --> 00:50:28,870
Okay...

967
00:50:30,470 --> 00:50:32,240
The correct answer is...

968
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:36,220
You just need to think very simply.
Here's the answer.

969
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:44,330
[A much simpler answer than expected.]

970
00:50:44,990 --> 00:50:46,600
Seriously?

971
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:48,800
That was my answer too!

972
00:50:50,790 --> 00:50:54,070
[What is the chosen Giraffe's answer?]

973
00:50:54,980 --> 00:50:57,300
<i>Lee Kwang Soo...
please reveal your answer.</i>

974
00:50:57,300 --> 00:51:02,130
[If the Giraffe gets it right, then
Panda will be the one to get soaked!]

975
00:51:08,460 --> 00:51:11,780
[What?]

976
00:51:12,420 --> 00:51:15,650
[What is that?]

977
00:51:24,020 --> 00:51:27,940
[Wrong as expected!
Giraffe is eliminated!]

978
00:51:27,940 --> 00:51:30,250
I got it right,
Ji Won, I got it right.

979
00:51:34,150 --> 00:51:36,570
[The next one up is, Penguin Ha Ha.]

980
00:51:39,740 --> 00:51:41,750
I'm going to go with a nonsense question.

981
00:51:41,750 --> 00:51:45,340
Ask a question that's common sense
instead of a nonsensical question.

982
00:51:45,980 --> 00:51:48,440
- Nonsense!
- Okay, give us your question.

983
00:51:49,140 --> 00:51:53,850
The celebrity who's teeth always shows...
I've pretty much given you the answer.

984
00:51:55,700 --> 00:51:59,750
- You have 30 seconds.
- You have to write down the name?

985
00:52:06,670 --> 00:52:08,130
Who is it?

986
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:12,000
Gary just asked me who it is.

987
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:16,580
Okay, the final 10 seconds!

988
00:52:16,580 --> 00:52:26,920
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,
five, four, three, two, one!

989
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:28,080
Time's up!

990
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:30,740
[Celebrity who's teeth always shows.
What's the correct answer?]

991
00:52:32,330 --> 00:52:34,650
It's someone we all know.

992
00:52:34,650 --> 00:52:37,120
[Lee Bo Young.]

993
00:52:38,250 --> 00:52:42,750
[Ha Ha now has to carefully choose someone
who's most likely to have the wrong answer.]

994
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:46,630
Be careful. Jae Suk
may just be pretending to know.

995
00:52:49,740 --> 00:52:51,560
- You close?
- What?

996
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:53,450
- Are you two close?
- No.

997
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:57,470
You're serious, right?

998
00:52:57,470 --> 00:52:59,410
You're not close?

999
00:52:59,810 --> 00:53:02,380
- You're not close?
- We're close!

1000
00:53:02,990 --> 00:53:05,350
[Quickly changing his story.]

1001
00:53:05,350 --> 00:53:08,520
- When's the last time you saw the person?
- What did you say?

1002
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:09,720
Why?

1003
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:11,030
Just answer the question.

1004
00:53:11,030 --> 00:53:14,060
- It's been about... two weeks?
- Two weeks?

1005
00:53:14,060 --> 00:53:17,190
In that case... is that right?

1006
00:53:17,190 --> 00:53:19,190
You saw that person two weeks ago?

1007
00:53:19,190 --> 00:53:21,330
So it's been two weeks?

1008
00:53:21,330 --> 00:53:24,720
Then in that case...
What about you, Ji Won?

1009
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:26,790
Are you two close?
Since I'm not sure about that.

1010
00:53:26,790 --> 00:53:29,870
- I... believe that we're close.
- You think you two are close?

1011
00:53:29,870 --> 00:53:32,180
- Yes, as a little brother.
- You're the little brother?

1012
00:53:32,190 --> 00:53:33,740
- Little?
- Little?

1013
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:35,330
Are you sure?

1014
00:53:35,330 --> 00:53:38,370
[Who did these two write down
as their answer?]

1015
00:53:38,370 --> 00:53:41,200
- What do you mean, little brother?
- Then what is it?

1016
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:43,640
What did you say?

1017
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:47,360
- What do you call the person?
- We have no titles between us.

1018
00:53:48,110 --> 00:53:49,730
- Then what is it?
- We're just friends.

1019
00:53:49,730 --> 00:53:51,790
- Really?
- We just go by our names.

1020
00:53:51,790 --> 00:53:52,870
- Really?
- Yeah!

1021
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:54,410
Okay then.

1022
00:53:54,410 --> 00:53:56,680
- What about you, Jessica?
- I like the person.

1023
00:53:56,680 --> 00:53:59,240
You like the person?
Do you call the person sister, or brother?

1024
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:01,090
- Brother.
- Brother?

1025
00:54:01,090 --> 00:54:02,900
Brother?

1026
00:54:03,390 --> 00:54:05,230
- Brother.
- Are you sure it's brother?

1027
00:54:05,230 --> 00:54:06,960
- It's brother?
- It's brother.

1028
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:08,740
[Jessica definitely seems
to have the wrong answer.]

1029
00:54:09,450 --> 00:54:10,720
Song Ji Hyo, you're next.

1030
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:13,030
- You know this person?
- Yeah.

1031
00:54:13,030 --> 00:54:15,720
[Blank...]

1032
00:54:17,230 --> 00:54:19,310
We can tell that she's totally
spaced out.

1033
00:54:19,310 --> 00:54:21,950
- When did you see the person last?
-  I see the person on regular basis.

1034
00:54:21,950 --> 00:54:23,300
Often?

1035
00:54:23,300 --> 00:54:25,450
- What do you call the person?
- Senior.

1036
00:54:25,460 --> 00:54:26,710
Senior?

1037
00:54:27,350 --> 00:54:28,860
Is it a brother or sister?

1038
00:54:29,380 --> 00:54:32,290
- Not brother or sister, but senior.
- Oh, just senior?

1039
00:54:32,290 --> 00:54:35,660
[Does she know the answer?
Blank Ji is avoiding it well...]

1040
00:54:35,660 --> 00:54:37,830
I'm not sure about Ji Hyo.

1041
00:54:37,830 --> 00:54:39,340
- Jae Suk.
- What?

1042
00:54:39,690 --> 00:54:44,470
Since he always disregards me...
it upsets me!

1043
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:46,130
Yoo Jae Suk!

1044
00:54:46,130 --> 00:54:49,280
[Yoo Jae Suk, get up here!]

1045
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:55,320
Okay!
Let's see this!

1046
00:54:55,330 --> 00:55:00,300
Even if the answer isn't the same,
can't it be something in the category?

1047
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:02,750
- Are you that confident?
- I think I'm right.

1048
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:04,420
I'm sure.

1049
00:55:04,420 --> 00:55:07,440
I wonder if I should let him off the hook?

1050
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:09,560
Since I can kill him whenever I want?

1051
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:13,270
Go back, go back!
I'll let you live until next time!

1052
00:55:13,270 --> 00:55:16,060
- Seriously...
- At least say thanks.

1053
00:55:16,060 --> 00:55:18,550
Thank you!

1054
00:55:22,150 --> 00:55:24,130
I'll let you live!

1055
00:55:24,140 --> 00:55:26,860
- Seriously...
- This is a stab at my pride!

1056
00:55:27,490 --> 00:55:28,850
Jessica!

1057
00:55:28,850 --> 00:55:30,710
[Jessica is called out in his place!]

1058
00:55:30,710 --> 00:55:36,600
[Who is the person that she kept
referring to as 'brother'?]

1059
00:55:41,250 --> 00:55:42,810
<i>Jessica, reveal your answer.</i>

1060
00:55:45,780 --> 00:55:48,840
[Yoo Jae Suk]

1061
00:55:48,850 --> 00:55:52,050
[Oh no...]

1062
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:05,230
Jessica!

1063
00:56:05,580 --> 00:56:08,510
You looked like you were shooting
a disaster movie.

1064
00:56:08,510 --> 00:56:10,120
I thought you were shooting a scene
from a disaster movie.

1065
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:17,640
[Jessica is eliminated
along with her scream.]

1066
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:20,460
How does your answer make
any sense?

1067
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:23,380
I thought you said you saw
the person often?

1068
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:25,590
Lee Bo Young!

1069
00:56:25,590 --> 00:56:28,450
It's your turn this time!
Get back to your spot!

1070
00:56:28,450 --> 00:56:31,540
It's my turn to ask the question.
You're finished!

1071
00:56:32,730 --> 00:56:35,160
- I let you off the hook once.
- Go back to your spot.

1072
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:37,480
- Fine!
- Who asked you to let me live?

1073
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:40,030
- I will make you shut that mouth of yours!
- Fine! Do it!

1074
00:56:40,030 --> 00:56:42,530
My mouth isn't easy to keep shut!

1075
00:56:44,210 --> 00:56:46,680
Let's go with the character idiom.

1076
00:56:46,680 --> 00:56:50,600
[A subject that all the animals are
weak at... character idiom.]

1077
00:56:50,610 --> 00:56:52,380
Really?
then write down your answer.

1078
00:56:52,380 --> 00:56:56,310
[Eliminated players can participate
out of boredom.]

1079
00:56:56,310 --> 00:56:58,740
- Can we go back if we get it right?
- Let us back in the game.

1080
00:56:58,740 --> 00:57:00,600
Here I go.

1081
00:57:01,010 --> 00:57:03,630
The three people standing back there...

1082
00:57:03,630 --> 00:57:06,360
any one of them is a good candidate
to get eliminated.

1083
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:08,700
Excuse me...
What are you talking about?

1084
00:57:08,730 --> 00:57:13,270
- What did you say?
- My name is a character idiom.

1085
00:57:14,100 --> 00:57:16,360
How is it that those people
are the ones left remaining?

1086
00:57:16,370 --> 00:57:18,640
I can't believe they're
the ones left remaining!

1087
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:21,560
[Remaining survivors that they
can hardly believe.]

1088
00:57:21,560 --> 00:57:23,570
- I can't believe this.
- This is what life is like!

1089
00:57:23,570 --> 00:57:25,480
This is what you call life!

1090
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:27,490
Want to put our heads together?

1091
00:57:27,490 --> 00:57:31,290
[The three remaining people are
deciding to work together.]

1092
00:57:31,290 --> 00:57:32,400
- Put out heads together?
- Seriously?

1093
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:34,290
- No problem! Put your heads together!
- Really?

1094
00:57:34,290 --> 00:57:36,210
- Sit down.
- Don't get upset!

1095
00:57:36,210 --> 00:57:38,350
[Doubt you'll get it right anyways...]

1096
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:40,120
I'm not going to give you any breaks!

1097
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:42,990
- Fine! Three against one!
- Let's do this!

1098
00:57:42,990 --> 00:57:44,280
We can do this!

1099
00:57:44,280 --> 00:57:47,680
Combine everything you've learned in
your life thus far and try to answer it!

1100
00:57:48,070 --> 00:57:52,570
[Seriously knocking down their pride!]

1101
00:57:52,570 --> 00:57:54,560
- He's really knocking down my pride!
- Try and see if you can get it!

1102
00:57:54,560 --> 00:57:58,540
- You know what to do, right?
- Give it your best shot!

1103
00:57:58,540 --> 00:58:01,250
Beat... Yoo Jae Suk!

1104
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,370
[You've got the wrong game...]

1105
00:58:05,370 --> 00:58:08,690
- Beat... Yoo Jae Suk!
- Beat him!

1106
00:58:08,700 --> 00:58:11,370
- We can do this.
- Here we go!

1107
00:58:11,370 --> 00:58:12,990
This is a character idiom.

1108
00:58:12,990 --> 00:58:15,400
Then if one of us gets it wrong,
then all of us gets it wrong?

1109
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:18,180
If we lose this, we have to live as fools
for the rest of our lives.

1110
00:58:18,180 --> 00:58:20,900
- This is no laughing matter.
- Okay.

1111
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:24,010
It's a good thing we're not still alive.

1112
00:58:24,010 --> 00:58:25,310
[Actually more comfortable
where they're at.]

1113
00:58:25,310 --> 00:58:26,450
Okay...

1114
00:58:26,450 --> 00:58:29,400
With the meaning that one is working
earnestly to do their best...

1115
00:58:29,990 --> 00:58:34,610
what is the idiom that describes using
an ax to make a needle out of something?

1116
00:58:34,610 --> 00:58:37,530
What is the idiom that describes using
an ax to make a needle out of something?

1117
00:58:37,530 --> 00:58:39,740
- Ax?
- Use of an ax...

1118
00:58:39,740 --> 00:58:41,580
Okay!

1119
00:58:41,580 --> 00:58:44,460
- Ax to make a needle out of something?
- We got this!

1120
00:58:44,460 --> 00:58:47,790
- We're good, we're good.
- How do you use an ax to make a needle?

1121
00:58:47,790 --> 00:58:49,760
What it means is...

1122
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:52,510
The character idiom here is...

1123
00:58:52,510 --> 00:58:54,050
let's try to figure this out now.

1124
00:58:54,050 --> 00:58:58,010
- This is...
- Give us the question one more time.

1125
00:58:58,010 --> 00:59:01,250
I can tell you a hundred times over!

1126
00:59:02,460 --> 00:59:04,960
With the meaning that one is working
earnestly to do their best...

1127
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:08,120
what is the idiom that describes using
an ax to make a needle out of something?

1128
00:59:08,120 --> 00:59:09,580
- What is the answer?
- If...

1129
00:59:09,590 --> 00:59:13,200
If you have the ax in hand but can't
make a needle, then it doesn't count!

1130
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:15,210
Am I right?

1131
00:59:15,210 --> 00:59:18,670
- If you have the ax...
- If someone gave you the ax...

1132
00:59:18,670 --> 00:59:21,950
- But if you can't make the needle...
- Then this doesn't count!

1133
00:59:21,950 --> 00:59:23,300
It doesn't count!

1134
00:59:23,980 --> 00:59:25,190
What did you say?

1135
00:59:25,970 --> 00:59:28,180
There's a point to what they're saying.

1136
00:59:28,180 --> 00:59:29,690
You think they have a point?

1137
00:59:29,690 --> 00:59:31,900
- They really do have a point.
- We have a very valid point.

1138
00:59:31,900 --> 00:59:34,970
[So... you don't know the answer?]

1139
00:59:34,970 --> 00:59:36,380
Let's see how well you do!

1140
00:59:36,390 --> 00:59:38,560
- If you have the ax...
- That's right!

1141
00:59:38,560 --> 00:59:41,170
but if you can't make a needle,
then none of this counts!

1142
00:59:41,170 --> 00:59:42,880
Then this question doesn't count!

1143
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:46,220
Since this may take a while,
I'll ask the disqualified ones one at a time.

1144
00:59:46,220 --> 00:59:49,030
[Interviewing the disqualified ones for the
answer since the others may take a while.]

1145
00:59:52,350 --> 00:59:54,760
- Jae Suk...
- Do you not know what character idiom is?

1146
00:59:56,110 --> 00:59:57,920
Why wouldn't I know that?

1147
00:59:57,920 --> 01:00:00,470
- I know it!
- I don't think you know what it means.

1148
01:00:00,470 --> 01:00:05,000
[First character idiom game he's ever
heard of at age 29...]

1149
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:06,790
Did he not know what he
was saying?

1150
01:00:06,790 --> 01:00:08,690
- Making a needle?
- He has no clue.

1151
01:00:08,690 --> 01:00:10,530
Making a needle.

1152
01:00:13,420 --> 01:00:15,700
Look at them.
Look at those guys over there.

1153
01:00:15,700 --> 01:00:17,750
They're not even looking
at me right now.

1154
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:20,390
[Avoiding meeting his gaze as
the given time is coming to a close.]

1155
01:00:21,120 --> 01:00:23,910
All I need to do is just reel one out!

1156
01:00:23,910 --> 01:00:26,680
[Even a casual throw is
a guarantee to bring one in!]

1157
01:00:26,680 --> 01:00:28,760
Hang on a second, let me see this.

1158
01:00:29,870 --> 01:00:33,820
[Using the boom mike as his
makeshift fishing rod.]

1159
01:00:33,830 --> 01:00:36,130
[Plenty of fish in the water!]

1160
01:00:36,140 --> 01:00:39,680
This is the fishing rod.
I don't even need any bait for this!

1161
01:00:39,690 --> 01:00:42,140
This is driving me crazy.

1162
01:00:43,250 --> 01:00:45,900
Okay... here we go!

1163
01:00:47,490 --> 01:00:49,140
Ha Ha, get out here!

1164
01:00:49,140 --> 01:00:53,080
[As predicted, he chooses Ha Ha!]

1165
01:00:54,390 --> 01:00:57,080
[Off the hook for now...]

1166
01:00:59,390 --> 01:01:01,420
Should I let you off the hook?

1167
01:01:02,930 --> 01:01:04,220
Thank you!

1168
01:01:04,220 --> 01:01:05,660
Okay.

1169
01:01:05,670 --> 01:01:07,360
You're really letting him off the hook?

1170
01:01:07,360 --> 01:01:08,740
Ha Ha, get out here.

1171
01:01:10,290 --> 01:01:13,170
Jae Suk!
Why are you being so evil?

1172
01:01:13,170 --> 01:01:15,340
Why do you keep picking on me?

1173
01:01:15,340 --> 01:01:19,270
[Grasshopper's image as seen
in the eyes of the Penguin.]

1174
01:01:20,250 --> 01:01:22,320
I let you off the hook last time.

1175
01:01:22,770 --> 01:01:24,620
I was wrong.

1176
01:01:24,620 --> 01:01:27,630
I don't care about getting soaked,
but my heart feels uneasy.

1177
01:01:28,910 --> 01:01:30,200
Thank you!

1178
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:32,030
Why are you showing him
your weak side?

1179
01:01:32,690 --> 01:01:34,760
- Ha Ha, out.
- Why are you doing this?

1180
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:39,000
Why are you doing this?

1181
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:42,220
- Just do it like a man!
- You might even get it right.

1182
01:01:42,230 --> 01:01:45,080
- Just give it a try.
- You don't know until you try.

1183
01:01:45,080 --> 01:01:47,770

- I know, but I can't say, can I?
- Just tell me how many letters.

1236

- Do you see your own masks?

1350
01:11:32,620 --> 01:11:34,670
- Our own masks...
- But...

1351
01:11:34,670 --> 01:11:36,490
How many years am I wearing this for?

1352
01:11:37,050 --> 01:11:39,660
- You look...
- How am I supposed to wear this?

1353
01:11:40,120 --> 01:11:43,180
[Ah... you sad beast with
the long neck...]

[I'm a giraffe!]

1355
01:11:46,850 --> 01:11:48,540
Try running.

1356
01:11:49,570 --> 01:11:52,250

[A loveable monkey, Kang Gary!]

1359
01:12:00,610 --> 01:12:02,920
I don't think Gary even
needs his mask.

1360
01:12:03,860 --> 01:12:07,310
[And the nation's beloved grasshopper.]

1361
01:12:09,450 --> 01:12:11,340
What does a panda do?

1362
01:12:11,340 --> 01:12:13,570
What pose are pandas usually in?

1363
01:12:16,970 --> 01:12:19,500
You really look like a panda with
your dark circles.

1364
01:12:19,500 --> 01:12:23,640
[Animal kingdom-
All nine animals makes their entrance!]

1365
01:12:23,640 --> 01:12:25,650
I'm getting a strange feeling.

[The final race -
Time to choose the king of all animals.]

1367

1368
01:12:34,940 --> 01:12:37,470
<i>not the name tag elimination...</i>

1369
01:12:38,330 --> 01:12:40,420
<i>but it's a mask elimination.</i>

1370
01:12:42,390 --> 01:12:45,200
[The final race, Mask elimination.]

1371
01:12:45,200 --> 01:12:46,780

1372
01:12:47,900 --> 01:12:51,040
[Baffled]

1373
01:12:51,040 --> 01:12:52,760
But this is...

1374
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:55,760
What is this?

1375
01:12:56,660 --> 01:12:58,950
As soon as someone grabs this,
it'll immediately...

1376
01:13:00,340 --> 01:13:03,820

1377
01:13:03,820 --> 01:13:05,350
[Mask elimination as the
final race - Start!]

1378
01:13:05,350 --> 01:13:07,380
Is there a way I can sew this on?

1379
01:13:08,240 --> 01:13:10,520
I want to sew the mask onto my face.

1380
01:13:11,280 --> 01:13:12,590
Would it be too painful?

1381
01:13:13,610 --> 01:13:15,060
Mask elimination?

1382
01:13:15,060 --> 01:13:18,510
[A very feasible race for even
the weakest of animals.]

1383
01:13:19,880 --> 01:13:22,710
[And...]

1384
01:13:22,710 --> 01:13:26,820
[A special advantage given to the grasshopper
for having won the previous mission.]

1385
01:13:28,570 --> 01:13:30,910
Give me something
I can finish this game with.

1386
01:13:30,910 --> 01:13:32,190
Just give me a game ender.

1387
01:13:32,190 --> 01:13:36,650
[What is the game changer that
is given to him?]

1388
01:13:36,650 --> 01:13:39,930
[Oh!]

1389
01:13:41,490 --> 01:13:44,820
[A fierce and unpredictable battle
between the beasts starts now!]

1390
01:13:53,270 --> 01:13:55,110
I'm way too visible.

1391
01:13:55,110 --> 01:13:56,880
[A visible giraffe that can be seen
from a 100m away.]

1392

[Blank Ji the cat, with an ax in her hand.]

1393
01:14:07,860 --> 01:14:10,430
- She's not easy to catch.
- What is...

1394
01:14:11,640 --> 01:14:13,240
- You stay away.
- I just grabbed your ears.

1395
01:14:13,240 --> 01:14:15,650
- Don't do that.
- You say you're going to catch me?

1396
01:14:15,650 --> 01:14:18,520
- Are you carrying a weapon?
- You can't carry an ax around.

1397
01:14:18,520 --> 01:14:21,060
I was going to give it to Jae Suk
for him to make needles with.

1398
01:14:21,060 --> 01:14:24,760
We have to work together.
We're all weak animals.

1399
01:14:24,760 --> 01:14:27,110
Fighting amongst ourselves is no use.

1400
01:14:27,110 --> 01:14:29,770
Penguin, panda, monkey and cat...
we're all prey.

1401
01:14:29,770 --> 01:14:31,680
- We have to get the predators first.
- Let's go.

1402
01:14:31,680 --> 01:14:32,920
Then let's go.

1403
01:14:33,680 --> 01:14:37,230
[Grasshopper watching
the whole scene from his hidden spot.]

1404
01:14:37,230 --> 01:14:39,240
- The Rabbit...
- What are you doing?

1405
01:14:39,240 --> 01:14:41,780
- What are you doing?
- What? I didn't do anything!

1406

- What? What did you do?

[Fighting within five seconds of
agreeing to work together.]

1408

- Yoo Jae Suk is behind us!
- What?

1409
01:14:48,050 --> 01:14:49,490
Is he waiting to fire?

1410
01:14:49,500 --> 01:14:51,070
There he is!
There's the Grasshopper!

1411
01:14:51,070 --> 01:14:53,060
- There he is!
- Get that Grasshopper!

1412
01:14:53,060 --> 01:14:57,500
- Get that Grasshopper!
- Catch the Grasshopper!

1413

within mere moments!]

I've got your ax right here!
Come make your needles!

1416
01:15:04,510 --> 01:15:06,620

[The Panda corrals him...
and the Cat blocks him...]

[And the Monkey attacks him!]

1419
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:16,730
Why is that Grasshopper so fast?

1420

[Grasshopper barely makes his escape.]

1421
01:15:30,570 --> 01:15:32,340
Why are they all attacking me?

1422
01:15:33,990 --> 01:15:37,320
They're attacking because they think
that I have something, don't they?

1423
01:15:37,330 --> 01:15:39,550
[Animals eyeing the Grasshopper first
for having been given an advantage.]

1424

The way this is going...
I'm going to need like five lives.

1425
01:15:46,940 --> 01:15:48,820
We almost had the Grasshopper!

1426

What are you guys doing?
Let's play together.

1427
01:15:54,210 --> 01:15:56,000

- Guys...
- You can't be riding around in a scooter!

1436
01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:27,980
Here's a monkey!
I've got a monkey right here!

[Running Man animals recommending
one another as menu items.]

1439

Don't you think you should be hunting
down the Grasshopper first?

1440
01:16:38,410 --> 01:16:42,500
Grasshopper has something that
none of us has.

1441
01:16:42,500 --> 01:16:44,290
Grasshopper has something.
We have to eliminate him first.

1442
01:16:46,980 --> 01:16:49,260
They're all probably fighting amongst
themselves, right?

1443

- Right?

happen, I'm going to go hide.

01:21:06,870 --> 01:21:10,450
<i>Monkey, Out.
Monkey, Out.</i>

1517
01:21:11,370 --> 01:21:14,660
[Monkey, Out!]

1518
01:21:14,660 --> 01:21:16,240
Run away!

1519
01:21:18,050 --> 01:21:20,150
<i>Tiger is here!</i>

1520
01:21:20,160 --> 01:21:21,530
I'll see you later.

1521
01:21:24,440 --> 01:21:28,710
[Fog settling in over
the chaotic animal kingdom...]

1522
01:21:31,380 --> 01:21:33,930
- Hey...
- Monkey sacrificed himself.

1523
01:21:33,930 --> 01:21:35,540
There's the Tiger.

1524
01:21:35,540 --> 01:21:37,190
- Tiger!
- Giraffe!

1525
01:21:37,200 --> 01:21:39,260
- What is he doing?
- The Tiger...

1526
01:21:39,260 --> 01:21:41,440
The Giraffe is aligning himself
with the Tiger.

1527
01:21:41,440 --> 01:21:43,590
- Tiger!
- Giraffe! Cross!

1528
01:21:43,590 --> 01:21:45,450
What is he doing?

1529
01:21:45,450 --> 01:21:49,770
[Traitor Giraffe aligning himself with
the Tiger as soon as he makes his getaway.]

1530
01:21:49,770 --> 01:21:51,260
- He really is too much.
- You really are...

1531
01:21:51,830 --> 01:21:54,260
You pathetic herbivores!

1532
01:21:54,270 --> 01:21:57,320
- You, Tiger!
- Come here, Rabbit.

1533
01:21:57,880 --> 01:21:59,570
Do you really trust the Giraffe?

1534
01:21:59,570 --> 01:22:03,490
[Resurrected Grasshopper is carefully
staying in hiding to not get caught.]

1535
01:22:04,150 --> 01:22:06,770
- We sent the Giraffe in.
- He's our spy.

1536
01:22:06,770 --> 01:22:10,100
By any chance... would you
be interested in accepting me?

1537
01:22:10,610 --> 01:22:12,280
- What is this?
- Would you accept me too?

1538
01:22:12,320 --> 01:22:15,120
[Oh my goodness...]

1539
01:22:15,120 --> 01:22:18,020
<i>You've still got it, Tiger!</i>

1540
01:22:20,170 --> 01:22:21,630
- Jong Kook...
- What?

1541
01:22:21,630 --> 01:22:24,720
I'd be so grateful if you left those two
and came over to us.

1542
01:22:25,070 --> 01:22:27,480
We will serve you with all that we have.

1543
01:22:27,480 --> 01:22:29,970
- Leave those two to us.
- Let me think about this a moment.

1544
01:22:31,020 --> 01:22:34,350
[What is going on out there?]

1545
01:22:34,350 --> 01:22:36,260
- What are you thinking?
- Those two are untrustworthy!

1546
01:22:36,260 --> 01:22:40,330
Everyone... all the animals...
now is our time.

1547
01:22:40,370 --> 01:22:42,510
We can get the Tiger together right now!

1548
01:22:44,110 --> 01:22:46,210
- Get your head on straight!
- I implore to my fellow animals!

1549
01:22:46,210 --> 01:22:48,670
[Just who will stick with whom?]

1550
01:22:49,610 --> 01:22:53,310
[Looking for loyalty amongst the
Traitors' Club members.]

1551
01:22:54,260 --> 01:22:57,960
[Giraffe blocking his ears out
of the agony.]

1552
01:22:58,960 --> 01:23:01,960
You're the only one we need.
You just need to come to us.

1553
01:23:01,960 --> 01:23:04,260
- Just you...
- I'm going over to the other side!

1554
01:23:06,850 --> 01:23:09,090
[Easy Brothers' coalition is broken!]

1555
01:23:12,040 --> 01:23:15,490
[Easy Brothers having become the prey
within moments.]

1556
01:23:15,490 --> 01:23:17,390
Get rid of them!

1557
01:23:22,540 --> 01:23:25,070
I have to hope that they fight
amongst themselves a lot.

1558
01:23:28,520 --> 01:23:32,310
[Easy Brothers making their escape
to inside the locker room.]

1559
01:23:32,840 --> 01:23:36,130
I will eliminate the traitors.

1560
01:23:37,880 --> 01:23:40,090
[Jong Kook, let's get rid of him.]

1561
01:23:40,090 --> 01:23:41,320
Yes!

1562
01:23:46,810 --> 01:23:49,230
[Protagonist Penguin is eliminated!]

1563
01:23:49,230 --> 01:23:50,990
You need to be eliminated!
Good job!

1564
01:23:50,990 --> 01:23:52,620
You did good.

1565
01:23:53,250 --> 01:23:55,640
[Penguin, Out!]

1566
01:23:56,670 --> 01:24:00,140
[Traitor Club's heart-wrenching friendship?]

1567
01:24:03,090 --> 01:24:05,850
The day is going to come for the
traitors one of these days.

1568
01:24:08,290 --> 01:24:10,350
Let's hide back here.
Let's stay here and hide.

1569
01:24:12,210 --> 01:24:14,940
[It seems as though there's some
sort of a plan in the works...]

1570
01:24:17,020 --> 01:24:18,480
[Go, go!]

1571
01:24:19,460 --> 01:24:22,370
[Ah... acting like Impala is ousted,
calling their bluff!]

1572
01:24:23,980 --> 01:24:26,360
- I eliminated him.
- Then you need to bring me his mask.

1573
01:24:26,360 --> 01:24:28,530
I need to bring his mask?
Wait, wait!

1574
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:34,070
[As guessed!
Not even going in to help!]

1575
01:24:34,070 --> 01:24:35,370
- Where are you going?
- Not me!

1576
01:24:35,380 --> 01:24:37,230
- Where are you going?
- You can eliminate me!

1577
01:24:39,820 --> 01:24:42,720
[Impala, Out!]

1578
01:24:46,080 --> 01:24:48,130
- Where are you going?
- I just...

1579
01:24:48,130 --> 01:24:50,830
I will just enjoy my grass,
and live in peace.

1580
01:24:54,050 --> 01:24:55,640
Please don't pay any attention to me.

1581
01:24:55,640 --> 01:24:58,480
[Giraffe having decided
to go back to his forest.]

1582
01:24:59,100 --> 01:25:00,760
I just want to go back to
my peaceful life.

1583

[Panda... springs an attack on the Tiger!]

1584
01:25:09,990 --> 01:25:11,850
I've been watching you!

1585
01:25:14,750 --> 01:25:17,250
I saw you making your moves
behind me!

1586
01:25:18,140 --> 01:25:20,460
My gloves!
My gloves slipped!

1587
01:25:20,460 --> 01:25:23,960
I saw you creeping up behind me!

1588
01:25:23,960 --> 01:25:27,490
- Do we have to keep...
- You scoundrel!

1589
01:25:27,490 --> 01:25:29,610
We should've been mating!
[What?]

1590
01:25:29,610 --> 01:25:32,630
[I'm sure you meant 'consensus',
not 'mating'...]

<i>[Panda, Out!
Panda, Out!]</i>

1592
01:25:39,020 --> 01:25:42,910
[Okay... everything is going well!]

1593
01:25:50,030 --> 01:25:53,470
Wait... but shouldn't we be thinking
about Jae Suk right about now?

1594
01:25:53,470 --> 01:25:55,190
I'm telling you,
there's something with Jae Suk.

1595
01:25:55,190 --> 01:25:57,970
I'm sure there's something.
There's something with Jae Suk.

1596
01:25:57,970 --> 01:26:01,120
I'm sure there's something we don't
know about Jae Suk right now.

1597
01:26:04,030 --> 01:26:05,490
Where are they?

1598
01:26:06,380 --> 01:26:07,870
Are they all together?

1599

[Grasshopper checking out the situation
with the camera filming the scene.]

1600
01:26:14,050 --> 01:26:16,630
I can smell the Grasshopper somewhere!

1601
01:26:16,630 --> 01:26:19,220
Let's do something about that Giraffe.

1602
01:26:19,220 --> 01:26:21,520
- Don't get sucked in by those words.
- Should we eliminate the Giraffe?

1603
01:26:21,520 --> 01:26:24,850
[An uncertain element that they can't
trust if they leave him alive...]

[Giraffe hunting into the fog!]

1605

Get the Giraffe!

1606

Who's that?
Giraffe?

1607
01:26:42,910 --> 01:26:48,380
[Slowly closing in on him with
the aid of the fog!]

1608
01:26:48,380 --> 01:26:50,900
I know there's something
with the Grasshopper.

1609
01:26:50,900 --> 01:26:53,720
There's no way he'd be
that easily ousted.

1610

[Giraffe having escaped the clutches
of the other animals.]

I'll lure them over here.

1614
01:27:20,120 --> 01:27:21,540
- What?
- I'll lure them over here.

1615
01:27:23,170 --> 01:27:25,090
- Let's end this quickly.
- Okay.

1616
01:27:25,090 --> 01:27:28,550
Giraffe!
Bring Jong Kook over here.

1617
01:27:39,210 --> 01:27:40,470
Giraffe?

1618
01:27:41,460 --> 01:27:43,130
You can see me?

1619
01:27:44,160 --> 01:27:46,290
I'm sorry!
I just want to live in peace.

1620

with Jae Suk.

that something is going on.]

- You sense it too?

1625
01:27:59,620 --> 01:28:01,570
- There's something going on, right?
- I sense something.

1626
01:28:01,580 --> 01:28:03,190
He's hiding something.

1627
01:28:03,540 --> 01:28:06,770
[What are you doing, Giraffe?]

1628
01:28:09,300 --> 01:28:12,890

going to take care of the Tiger...]

[Giraffe sets his target on the Cat!]

1630

from his hiding spot!]

[Fails at his attempt
to eliminate the Tiger!]

having seen the Grasshopper's resurrection.]

become the king of the prairie.]
