Jae Suk, why don't you ask the questions?

33
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:39,940

before in the past?

followed it up with a race.

[Seventh place - Ji Suk Jin.]

56

Why are you announcing that so loudly?

57
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:48,600
- Why are you saying that so loudly?
- You looked at Kwang Soo as you said that.

58
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:51,710
- Okay...
- This is kind of nerve-wrecking.

59

- This is interesting.

60
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,850

[What? Kwang Soo?]

65
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:08,480
That means I placed higher than you!

66
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,700

With how low his rank was,
Lee Kwang Soo right now...

97
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,830

back to Vietnam.

00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,920
- I can't believe he came in at first place.
- Seriously...

166
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:16,580
But why didn't you include Ha Ha
and Suk Jin on the list?

167
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:19,300
I was told that I didn't need to
write down the fifth and sixth place...

168
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:23,410
[Sorry]

169
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:30,720
- I'll reveal the teams.
- Okay.

170
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:33,860
- Yoo Jae Suk, Jong Kook...
- We're on the same team?

171
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:37,170
<i>And our guest, Lee Bo Young...
the three of you are a team.</i>

172
00:08:37,170 --> 00:08:39,830
Why? That's going to make me
uncomfortable.

173
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:44,160
[Kkuk with some leftover resentment.]

174
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:46,200
That makes me feel uncomfortable.
Why did you team me up like that?

175
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:49,690
- That makes me real uncomfortable?
- Instead of first and second, she's with us?

176
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:53,000
<i>We had already chosen the teams
before finding out about the results.</i>

177
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:55,610
Why did you choose the teams without
even asking me for my opinion?

178
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:58,290
See?
She's disappointed about it.

179
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:00,610
I really should be taking
care of her today.

180
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:04,750
[Bo Young, Jae Suk, and Kkuk feeling
uneasy about the team placement.]

181
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:08,970
<i>And next, Kang Gary and Ji Hyo...
you'll be a team with Lee Sang Yoon.</i>

182
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:11,030
[Teamed up with Sang Yoon.]

183
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:13,470
<i>Tra-it-ors!
Cross!</i>

184
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:18,000
The Traitors Club is teamed up today.
Please show us lots of love and support.

185
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:22,450
[The unchosen ones
full of drive and ambition.]

186
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:24,830
But seeing the three of you lately
really has been nice.

187
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:27,470
<i>These are the three teams that will
be competing in the race today.</i>

188
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:30,060
<i>I will explain today's race to all of you.</i>

189
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:33,160
<i>There was a lot of talk between
our guests and the survey conducted</i>

190
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:36,020
<i>and as I've mentioned to you earlier,
this is The Best Couple Race.</i>

191
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:40,730
<i>Through a series of missions, you'll
work to earn yourselves a running ball.</i>

192
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:42,190
Running ball?

193
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:44,290
[Running ball makes its comeback
after all this time!]

194
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:50,150
<i>The quicker you pass your missions,
the more running balls you'll earn.</i>

195
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:53,520
<i>These balls are currently blank
and devoid of any writing at the moment.</i>

196
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,100
<i>But when you arrive at
the final location</i>

197
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:59,280
<i>you'll write the names on them yourselves
to enter into the drawing.</i>

198
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,640
[What will become of the lucky draw?]

199
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:05,540
[Best couple race - Start.]

200
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:09,180
- I like sitting in the middle.
- You do?

201
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:14,160
This is nice and bright,
but the pink color is a little...

202
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,950
It's okay, Jae Suk. It's going to
make our faces look brighter.

203
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,720
As long as Bo Young looks beautiful,
that's all that matters.

204
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,740
I think we're going to look
very bright and nice on screen.

205
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:22,900
Actually... you look really
ugly right now.

206
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:25,960
- What... you think you look pretty?
- Seriously...

207
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:28,590
Actually, I love the way
men look in hot pink.

208
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:29,940
- Really?
- Really?

209
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:31,500
[Cheering up at Bo Young's comment.]

210
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,820
My skin is a little darker...

211
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:34,820
- So it looks sexy.
- That's what I'm thinking.

212
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:36,470
- Hot pink does that to darker skin?
- Of course.

213
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:38,840
Wearing it with darker skin
makes it pretty.

214
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,150
Especially with a V-neck shirt.
Jae Suk doesn't know that kind of stuff.

215
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:43,520
You don't wear V-necks.
Your collars go down to the chest.

216
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,900
What?
I don't wear shirts like that!

217
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,780
- I can't stand seeing you like that!
- When have I ever worn shirts like that?

218
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:52,430
There's a limit to the cut of the collar,
but yours comes all the way down the chest.

219
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:55,540
I really hate feeling suffocated.
I hate having things around my neck.

220
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:57,170
Where is this place?

221
00:10:57,170 --> 00:10:58,910
Tree-lined street in Shinsadong?

222
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:00,840
<i>[Go to the tree lined street in Shinsadong
and look for the Running Man landmark.]</i>

223
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,700
Hurry, let's hurry.

224
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,960
I feel like I'm watching TV.
This feels surreal.

225
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:12,120
With how smart and studious Sang Yoon is...
I think he's going to be very competitive.

226
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,810
Sang Yoon's very athletic too.

227
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:17,840
- Look at what good shape he's in.
- He's very good at basketball.

228
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:19,900
He's very different from you, isn't he?

229
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:22,840
- Hey, Song Ji Hyo...
- That's not you, is it?

230
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:25,470
But I pull it off once in awhile
and get the job done.

231
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:26,980
'Random Mr. Capable?'

232
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,760
- You know...
- I will do my best.

233
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,950
Kang Gary should've been teamed up
with Lee Bo Young today.

234
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:36,770
- You must be disappointed.
- I can't betray you like that on a Monday.

235
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:38,490
Listen to you.

236
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:41,930
Why not? You were having fun with
Lee Yeon Hee a couple of weeks ago.

237
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:44,240
- Were you jealous?
- Oh my goodness.

238
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:47,560
- I'm a little jealous today myself.
- Don't kid yourself.

239
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:50,670
You have no idea how close
Sang Yoon and I are.

240
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:52,890
Really?

241
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,070
- There it is. There's the landmark.
- Where? Where is it?

242
00:11:57,070 --> 00:11:58,760
- It's over there, Bo Young.
- Over there?

243
00:11:58,760 --> 00:11:59,920
[Running Man landmark is discovered.]

244
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,290
There it is.
I see the yellow flag over there.

245
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:10,010
- Read it out loud.
- What is it?

246
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:12,590
<i>Sit a member in a hand carriage</i>

247
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:15,650
<i>and the one being carried must make
a goal with the empty cup to pass.</i>

248
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:18,840
- Bo Young has to do this.
- If you don't succeed at once, must move on.

249
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:21,020
- I don't think I can succeed.
- You have to do it.

250
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:23,620
[A very hot and popular street in Seoul.]

251
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:26,290
[A mecca of popular current styles,
and trendy cafes.]

252
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:31,210
<i>This is your starting point,
and you'll see other cafes below.</i>

253
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:33,400
<i>You'll see cafes down
this whole street.</i>

254
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:37,530
<i>When you start off with her in the carriage,
you'll see various goal posts.</i>

255
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:39,310
We have to start off from here
with her in a hand carriage?

256
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:40,360
<i>That's right.</i>

257
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:43,390
<i>You can acquire the empty cups
from the crowd that is gathered.</i>

258
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:47,650
- Can't we carry her once we get to the goal?
- Bo Young is very light, so should be okay.

259
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:49,860
- I've gained some weight though.
- Bo Young...

260
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:51,510
- You can sit right here.
- You just sit right here.

261
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:53,620
- Sit down right here.
- Sit down?

262
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,900
- Like this?
- Yes. You're so light!

263
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:58,730
- You're so light!
- You are very light.

264
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:02,040
[Moving on with her in their arms.]

265
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:04,160
- You're so light.
- I'm sorry!

266
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,530
- No, not at all.
- It's okay, you're light.

267
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:09,100
- Hello.
- What to do?

268
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:15,040
- You're perhaps too light.
- No, I'm not!

269
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,480
- You're very light.
- Bo Young...

270
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,020
If we're to bypass going to
the next location...

271
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:22,870
We've even had to carry
Noh Sa Yeon like this before.

272
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:26,010
- We've carried Noh Sa Yeon like this before.
- What do I do?

273
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:29,230
[Traitors Club is off to
do their mission.]

274
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:31,020
Have you gained weight?

275
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:34,450
[The Green Team also gets
their hand carriage ready.]

276
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:39,690
- You saw that, right?
- What? What?

277
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:43,990
One, two, three.

278
00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:47,130
- Fighting!
- Fighting.

279
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:50,360
[Moving quickly on the
strong young men's hand carriage.]

280
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,790
Where do we have to go?
Where's the first stop?

281
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,420
It's marked by the 'R', right?

282
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:56,200
You've gotten much lighter
than the past, Ji Hyo.

283
00:13:56,200 --> 00:14:00,200
- I lost a lot of weight.
- I know. How much weight did you lose?

284
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:03,480
- Cup...
- We have to find empty cups.

285
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,020
We have to get the cups
from the cafe, right?

286
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:08,180
[Even though it's said that cafes
are lined up and down the street...]

287
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,420
Not many people carry around
an empty cup.

288
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:13,090
Does anyone have
an empty paper cup?

289
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:15,650
Over here. She has one.
You're not done with that, are you?

290
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:17,810
- Are you done with that?
- No, I'm not done yet.

291
00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:19,550
- Over here!
- Here's one.

292
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:21,690
Me!
Give it to me!

293
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:22,890
- She's not done yet.
- Give it to me.

294
00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:25,280
[It has to be an empty cup...]

295
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:28,780
- One, two, three.
- There we go.

296
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:31,800
[What?
One shot?]

297
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:35,680
- That must be so cold.
- Just give it to us.

298
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,410
- That's good.
- Thank you!

299
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:45,460
Take turns drinking it.

- Sorry, I bet that was cold.
- Thank you, and sorry!

303

Sorry for making you do that.
Thanks!

304
00:14:56,650 --> 00:14:59,160
- Why are you having such a hard time?
- My arm is getting tired.

305
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,990
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

306
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:03,520
Thank you. We have to
take the lid for the weight.

307

[The Yellow Team finds themselves a cup.]

308
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,390
- Let's go.
- Hike me up. One, two, three.

309
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:10,810
I'm tired.

310
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,360
Give me your cup...
are you done with your coffee?

311
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,940
Anyone who's done with their coffee?

312

- Can you give us your cup?
- Are you done with that cup?

313
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:21,560
- Drink it up!
- Isn't that hot?

- Thank you so much.
- You'll be blessed.

- Even your girlfriend...
- Thank you, girlfriend!

- I promise that we'll win today.
- We'll win this mission!

- Thank you!

I don't think I can make this.

322

Throw it.

00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:51,410
[The empty cup just flailing
down to the ground.]

325
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:53,090
- No, it's okay.
- I'll switch with someone.

326
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:55,090
Why don't you go up?
I'll lift you.

327
00:15:56,310 --> 00:15:59,220
- Let's switch positions!
- You want to throw it?

328
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:01,410
- I don't think I can do this.
- I'll carry most of the weight.

329
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:04,060
- Really?
- Yes, get up there.

330
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:05,160
[What? Jae Suk is really going to
get up and throw the cup?]

331
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:07,370
- Bo Young...
- We can do this.

332
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:11,090
Bo Young says she wants to do it.
It's only for a moment anyway.

333
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,830
[Making Bo Young carry him
in a hand carriage?]

334
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:18,650
Bo Young says this is what
she wants to do!

335
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:21,530
Here, I'll stand right here.
Lean towards me.

336
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:24,520
No, you can sit here.
You can sit over here!

337
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:28,350
[Leaning completely on
hot pink clad Kkuk.]

338
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:30,040
Bo Young, I'm set.
This is good.

339
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,590
[Using that moment to steal
the empty cup?]

340
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:35,010
You can lean on me!
It's okay!

341
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:37,690
- Why are you getting angry, Bo Young?
- Sit up straight!

342
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:40,240
- Just grab onto me!
- I'm good.

343
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,190
- Throw it!
- Hold still. One, two, three!

344
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,990
[A good throw!]

345
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:49,740
[No goal...]

346
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,950
[The empty cup sadly goes to the side...]

347
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:56,480
- Challenge!
- Please... you can do this.

348
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,910
- Please... let's do this.
- Dong Hoon, you have to make this.

349
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:01,470
[Huh?]

350
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:05,710
[Fail. Disqualified from hitting the roof.]

351
00:17:07,330 --> 00:17:09,670
- Did you not see the roof?
- Let me try it one more time.

352
00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:12,290
- I have one too.
- You want to try throwing it?

353
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:15,390
['R2'- second attempt.]

354
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,250
One, two, three.

355
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:19,030
[Impala brother makes his attempt.]

356
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:20,480
How am I supposed to throw like this?

357
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,770
<i>This is your last attempt.</i>

358
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:23,400
I don't think he's going to make it.

359
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,610
[I will make it!]

360
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:34,030
Hang on!

361
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:37,260
[What was that thudding noise?]

362
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:42,290
They put a rock in there!
There's a rock!

363
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:44,470
[A rock inside the empty cup...]

364
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:48,010
- They put a rock in there!
- Run. Let's run for it.

365
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:52,940
- What is that?
- Some dust got in there.

366
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:55,190
Since you cheated, you'll leave last.
Please return to your spot.

367
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:57,360
- Seriously...
- You cheated. Go back to your spot.

368
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,790
[No way to get out of it.
Countless number of witnesses to testify.]

369
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:02,340
- Wait.
- Hang on...

370
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:05,060
[Sang Yoon to make his attempt
for the Green Team.]

371
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:08,710
[Even Blank Ji can boast of her many
experiences with the hand carriage.]

372
00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:18,920
[Totally dead on!]

373
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:21,110
That's too bad!

374
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,760
- That's too bad.
- One more try?

375
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:25,620
Don't rush it so much.

376
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:27,730
- Don't rush it. Come this way a bit.
- Okay.

377
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:28,910
[One more remaining chance.]

378
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:31,440
[With his proven skills,
will he succeed this time?]

379
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:40,530
[Hits the flag this time and fails...]

380
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:42,350
- Can we go now?
- Are we okay to go?

381
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:45,020
[Pink Team on their way to 'R3'.]

382
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:46,970
- Are you not done with that?
- No, it's not an empty cup.

383
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:49,090
[Keep on moving.
Must find an empty cup.]

384
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:52,130
- I think the paper cup would be better.
- Right? Paper cups are better to throw.

385
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:53,890
- Paper cups are much better.
- Where can we find one?

386
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:55,970
It's so far.

387
00:18:57,670 --> 00:18:59,970
- Why is it so far?
- One, two, three.

388
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,000
I'm trying to find a cup.

389
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,420
[Unable to find any empty cups.
May have to go to a cafe at this rate.]

390
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:10,550
- Hello.
- We have to find a cup.

391
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:13,080
- Are there any cups?
- Is that a cup? Thank you!

392
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:15,540
[Finds one right before arriving
at their destination.]

393
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:17,330
Hello.
What is that?

394
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,510
[Arrives at 'R3' for their third
chance to throw the cup.]

395
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,710
- It's not that much closer.
- It's a little closer this time.

396
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:26,030
- You can throw it.
- No, no.

397
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:27,740
No, I don't want to.
I can help lift you up instead.

398
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:33,140
- Let's end it this time. Let's really end it.
- This agony...

399
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:35,540
- Let's end this agony.
- We have to end it this time.

400
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:36,910
- We have to end it this time.
- We can end it right here.

401
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:39,400
- Bo Young...
- Okay.

402
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:42,000
- Bo Young is no joke.
- I'm fine. This isn't difficult.

403
00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:44,820
Please... please.
Let me make it just this once.

404
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:46,190
- Bo Young, are you okay?
- Yes!

405
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:47,200
Okay, here I go!

406
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:56,490
[Oh... it went in!]

407
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:00,700
[A goal in!]

408
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:07,500
- This is unbelievable!
- We did it!

409
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:09,030
[Pink Team succeeds!]

410
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:11,240
- That was great!
- We did it!

411
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,820
In one single shot!

412
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:14,790
- That was great!
- That was a nice throw!

413
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:20,400
- We can go?
- That was unbelievable!

414
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,370
Can we go?
I can walk now, right?

415
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:25,240
- I can't believe this.
- I can't believe that either.

416
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,180
Did they succeed?

417
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:29,630
- Hey... did you pass?
- Did you succeed?

418
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:31,840
You succeeded?
Who did it?

419
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,860
- Who threw it?
- With just one throw.

420
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,640
Did you make the goal?

421
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,530
- They must've succeeded.
- They must've made the goal.

422
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:41,080
Bye!

423
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:43,600
- Did you make it?
- We are finished here!

424
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,880
Coffee!
Coffee!

425
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:50,290
I can't believe you made it in one shot.
That was seriously no joke.

426
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:53,690
- Is it okay to be this cool?
- I don't know, but that was awesome.

427
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:57,460
A throw like this...
I can't believe that just happened.

428
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:00,890
- Why did you do that?
- What have you done?

429
00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:03,180
Are you out of your mind or what?

430
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:05,860
Do you have any idea what
you've just done?

431
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:07,830
[He's about to start a talk show
with his own hand.]

432
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:11,920
- Let's each take a turn.
- Should we each take a turn?

433
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,900
- Yeah, let's each take a turn.
- I'll go first.

434
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:16,110
[Each fairly taking a turn.
Giraffe to throw the first shot.]

435
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:17,650
Let's lift him up on our shoulders.

436
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:20,390
- Hang on, that hurts.
- Can you scoot me up?

437
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:22,360
- Okay, on the shoulder.
- Okay, this is good.

438
00:21:22,370 --> 00:21:24,150
- Suk Jin! Wait!
- What? What is it?

439
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:27,340
[Almost got smacked in the head...]

440
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:31,070
- I didn't know.
- Please be a little more careful.

441
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:35,970
[Yellow Team's giant, Giraffe's turn.]

442
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:37,230
- First attempt!
- Challenge!

443
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:40,040
- Get it in there.
- Make the shot.

444
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:44,190
[Misses it by a long shot.]

445
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:45,240
Let's go.

446
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:47,150
Okay, my turn.

447
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:49,990
[Little Ro-Ro to take his turn.]

448
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:53,220
Hey, you're standing too far apart.

449
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:55,260
Hey, get closer.

450
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:59,500
[Basketball mania Ro-Ro to
take his turn.]

451
00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:01,560
You can do this.

452
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:07,920
[Success]

453
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:12,320
[Yellow Team succeeds their mission.]

454

Tr-ai-tor!
Cross!

455
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:21,650
- We're in second place right now.
- Second place. Let's go.

456
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:24,720
[Rather than friendship,
winning is the Traitors Club's priority.]

457
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,060
Let's do this.

458
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:29,040
- Where's our car?
- I wonder if we can do this.

459
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:31,080
- Over there.
- Are those trash cans?

460
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,910
- You came in at first place, right?
- Yes.

461
00:22:32,910 --> 00:22:34,920
Here you go.

462
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:37,270
[Three running balls each!]

[The next mission location is...]

464
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:43,330
I bet you'd be shocked.
I had no idea I could do that.

465
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:49,710
<i>[Go to Ttukseom Amusement Park by the
Han River and find the Running Man landmark.]</i>

466
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:52,620
- Please get in.
- I still can't believe that.

467
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:53,810
Thank you!

468
00:22:55,770 --> 00:23:00,040
Bo Young had a good plan.
If it wasn't for her, we wouldn't have won.

469
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:02,810
This was possible all because of
Bo Young's self-sacrifice.

470
00:23:02,810 --> 00:23:04,430
This is what you call teamwork!

471
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:07,240
I'm sure it wasn't easy on Bo Young.

472
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:09,280
[These men are such chatterboxes...]

473
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,520
I was so worried that she may
hurt her wrist by doing that.

474
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:16,400
Since leaning all my weight on you
throws off the balance.

475
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,490
- That's right. So you had no choice.
- I had no choice but to do that.

476
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:21,190
- There's the Yellow Team.
- Did you succeed?

477
00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:24,030
We're following right behind you.

478
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:30,200
- This is great!
- Today is the day!

479
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,290
- I'm getting a good feeling about this!
- We're in second place.

480
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:38,480
- We've still got it, Traitors Club!
- Everyone, together!

[Spreading out their cheers
amongst all the citizens.]

482

We've still got it, Traitors Club!

483
00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:47,440
- Nice!
- Let's go!

[Yellow Team coming in second.]

486
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:53,350
- Trash can?
- You came in second, right?

487
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:56,140
[Two running balls each.]

488
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:59,160
[Green Team having had to go
all the way to 'R4'.]

489
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,420
First attempt.

490
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:03,790
[Oh?]

491
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:05,310
[Success]

492
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,300
[One shot!]

493
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,880
[Green Team each receives one running ball
and gets on their way.]

494
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:17,140
Wow... that first game
was too exhausting.

495
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:18,490
That was hard.

496
00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:22,640
- There's something I'm curious about...
- Yeah?

497
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:25,160
Do you two keep in close contact
on other days besides Monday?

498
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:29,080
On Mondays, more than any other couple...
we're as sweet as candy.

499
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:31,860
[Monday Couple gives it
their best on Mondays.]

500
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:33,350
Sweet, yet combative.

501
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:37,280
If we stay close and do the show
together for seven to eight years...

502
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:41,260
then I bet you'll become the longest
relationship I've ever had.

503
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:50,700
[Han River Ttukseom district.]

504
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:54,540
[Pink Team is the first to arrive.]

505
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:57,220
- Let's all get out.
- I think there's something here.

506
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:59,510
- Seriously...
- What is this?

507
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:05,950
What is this? This looks like
some sort of jumping game.

508
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:08,010
- Is it distance jumping?
- Something else I'm not good at.

509
00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:13,760
[A long and unidentifiable green board.]

510
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:16,910
What is this?
An acupuncture mat?

511
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:18,970
- Seriously...
- Seriously!

512
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,020
[The green liner mat is...]

513
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:25,700
[The frightening acupuncture mat.]

514
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:30,840
[The very same acupuncture mat even
the world action star, Jackie Chan hated.]

515
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:32,420
What do we do about this?

516
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:35,240
<i>It's three level jumping
on the acupuncture mat.</i>

517
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:36,240
I'm wearing very thin socks.

518
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:39,520
<i>You have to take off your socks
and do it barefoot.</i>

519
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:43,800
<i>Each of you must jump while barefoot,
and we'll record the distance.</i>

520
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,440
Is it the acupuncture mat?

521
00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:50,220
- I'm going to have to work again.
- Oh my God...

522
00:25:51,090 --> 00:25:53,760
- Oh my, that hurts!
- This really hurts your feet.

523
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:56,550
[Shocks of pain even at the
slightest touch.]

524
00:25:58,130 --> 00:26:00,560
[At an advantage with tall Sang Yoon
on their team?]

525
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,680
But I'm a chicken when it comes
to the acupuncture mat.

526
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:07,350
<i>If your combined distance is 20m or over,
then you succeed the mission.</i>

527
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:09,480
- We should've gotten here first.
- I'll go first.

528
00:26:09,490 --> 00:26:10,750
You're going to go first?

529
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:14,730
I need to go first to determine what
the remaining distance is going to be.

530
00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:16,190
- You're right.
- That way, we'll know what we need.

531
00:26:16,890 --> 00:26:18,260
Okay, Bo Young is going to go first.

532
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:21,220
We're in trouble.

533
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:22,500
That's prickly!

534
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:25,110
[And laughs it right off...]

535
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:27,220
- I'm telling you, this is no joke.
- One, two, three...

536
00:26:30,770 --> 00:26:32,350
Bo Young...

537
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:37,260
[Why is she walking so far back?]

538
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:40,790
If you go too far back,
it's going to hurt having to walk back.

539
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:44,140
- I'm trying to numb my feet right now.
- To desensitize your feet?

540
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:47,160
That's good.
That's the stuff Jong Kook really loves.

541
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:49,930
[Her ferociousness is the style
that Coach Kkuk really likes.]

542
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:53,510
- This is some serious stuff.
- Ouch!

543
00:26:56,590 --> 00:26:58,450
[Jumping in place?]

544
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:03,160
- Jump. Try it. You have to get used to it.
- It hurts enough to just watch.

545
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,640
[Coach Kkuk's forceful guidance.]

546
00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:11,460
[Pads of the feet are desensitized.]

547
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:14,360
Okay. Now you're used to it.
You should be okay now.

548
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:18,720
I'm not good at things like this.

549
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,680
- Okay, here I go.
- Will you be okay?

550
00:27:21,470 --> 00:27:25,540
[A woman who belies her image...]

551
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:30,740
[The woman who volunteered
the take the first leap!]

552
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:34,710
- Be careful.
- One, two, three!

553
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:40,600
[Easily leaps three bounds.]

554
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,490
[Wow! 4.6m!]

555
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:45,020
She jumped a good distance.

556
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:47,590
Unbelievable!
This really hurts!

557
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:51,500
- He says that was a foul.
- Why?

558
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:53,590
- You went over the red line.
- I did?

559
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:58,140
[Bo Young having been too eager.]

560
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:02,580
[Ah... her foot crossed the red line
by a smidgen which resulted in a foul.]

561
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:06,440
That's absurd!

562
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:09,060
This is too painful for it
to count as a foul.

563
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:13,430
[Pink Team's current record is 0m.
It's now Jae Suk's turn.]

564
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,100
He's disqualified already.

565
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:19,290
[Walking onto the mat?]

566
00:28:19,290 --> 00:28:23,300
[Three step walk?
A mere 2m record?]

567
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:25,120
- What are you doing?
- That hurts too much.

568
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,860
I don't think I can run on that thing.

569
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:30,380
- You give it a try. Seriously, try it.
- What?

570
00:28:31,630 --> 00:28:36,350
[Mr. Capable has to jump more than
18m for them to succeed...]

571
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:43,000
If you keep doing that,
you're going to start bleeding!

572
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:48,480
[Displaying the fierce, painless
side of him.]

573
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:52,390
- You're going to start bleeding!
- Don't end up at the hospital!

574
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:54,870
Whenever he's like this...

575
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:14,330
[The agony sets in...]

576
00:29:14,330 --> 00:29:15,850
You deserve it.

577
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:22,000
I'm glad.
He deserves it.

578
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,440
He seriously deserves it.

579
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:27,480
That seriously hurts!
Wow...

580
00:29:27,490 --> 00:29:30,700
- Hey! Why don't you ever listen to me?
- That seriously hurts!

581
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:36,600
- Ji Hyo, you need to...
- Gary, hang on. I don't think I can jump.

582
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,610
Ji Hyo, you have to take off your socks.

583
00:29:41,930 --> 00:29:45,170
You have to take off your socks.
Take off your socks.

584
00:29:45,170 --> 00:29:48,510
- Hang on a second. Give me a second.
- Miss Blank, take off your socks.

585
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:51,770
- Take off your socks.
- I said, okay!

586
00:29:53,290 --> 00:29:56,280
- Sang Yoon... take off your socks.
- What is this thing?

587
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:58,820
- Sang Yoon, your socks.
- Hurry up and take off your socks!

588
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:02,770
- Sang Yoon, take off your socks.
- Take off your socks right now!

589
00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:04,300
- I'll take them off!
- Take them off!

590
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:06,570
- Take them off!
- Okay!

591
00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:09,150
- Take them off, Song Ji Hyo.
- There you go!

592
00:30:09,150 --> 00:30:11,570
- Get up!
- Song Ji Hyo, just endure it.

593
00:30:11,570 --> 00:30:13,950
Hey!
Kim Jong Kook!

594
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,570
How does that feel?

595
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:20,170
The three kings of the acupuncture mat
are on their way right now.

596
00:30:21,150 --> 00:30:25,480
[The three people who had Jackie Chan
in tears of laughter with their antics.]

597
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:28,000
- Hurry!
- Hurry up!

598
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,300
- They're coming.
- Challenge!

599
00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:31,560
[Sang Yoon of the Green Team's turn.]

600
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,880
- Challenge.
- I don't think he's ready yet.

601
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:39,650
[How will Sang Yoon's skills in three step
distance jumping measure up?]

602
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,930
- Sang Yoon...
- I think he can do it.

603
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,310
- Sang Yoon...
- I think he can do it.

604
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:57,690
[Unbelievable jump!]

605
00:31:00,170 --> 00:31:02,710
[Easily jumps the 8m distance?]

606
00:31:09,650 --> 00:31:10,870
[The start off point is okay!]

607
00:31:15,810 --> 00:31:17,950
[A whopping 8.2m!]

608
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:21,860
Since his legs are so long...
he practically flew in the air.

609
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:24,490
- What is it?
- They're here.

610
00:31:24,490 --> 00:31:27,050
[The kings of the acupuncture mat
have arrived.]

611
00:31:27,050 --> 00:31:28,720
- Three step distance jump.
- Three step distance jump?

612
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,920
- Barefoot.
- What?

613
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,780
- It's an acupuncture mat.
- We have to jump barefoot?

614
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,780
[Flustered upon hearing that it's been
upgraded to barefoot status.]

615
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:36,250
- Get up here right now.
- Wait...

616
00:31:36,250 --> 00:31:39,590
Bo Young is worse than me!
She's telling me to stand up here.

617
00:31:40,130 --> 00:31:44,040
- These two on my team...
- Hurry up and stand up here.

618
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:48,140
I really don't like this team.

619
00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:52,630
- They're way too competitive.
- Bo Young and I are a good match.

620
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:55,270
Challenge.

621
00:31:56,150 --> 00:31:58,230
Sang Yoon did really well.

622
00:31:58,230 --> 00:32:00,870
What is she... what are you doing?

623
00:32:00,870 --> 00:32:03,480
- What is she... what are you doing?
- What is that?

624
00:32:03,490 --> 00:32:06,030
[Taking small cautious steps.]

625
00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:09,680
[Three light steps...]

626
00:32:10,890 --> 00:32:13,610
- What was that?
- What are you doing?

627
00:32:13,610 --> 00:32:15,520
- Are you kidding around?
- You give it a try!

628
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:17,690
- You have no idea how much it hurts!
- Does it hurt that much?

629
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,430
2.7m.

630
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:22,630
[Ji Hyo's record is 2.7m...]

631
00:32:22,630 --> 00:32:25,230
I feel like I can fly across the mat
if I'm allowed to wear socks.

632
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:27,230
Can we do it with our socks on?

633
00:32:27,610 --> 00:32:29,550
- Gary.
- Challenge.

634
00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:31,050
[Gary needs to get minimum of
9.1m for them to succeed.]

635
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:33,050
[Huh?]

636
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:36,100
[Cringing]

637
00:32:43,090 --> 00:32:45,160
It hurts your hand when you try
to push yourself off the mat too.

638
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,380
It really hurts!

639
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:48,130
[Green Team - Fail.]

640
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,600
[Yellow Team's challenge.]

641
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:57,420
[The shock that can be felt
throughout their whole body.]

642
00:32:57,990 --> 00:33:00,530
Suk Jin, the fact that you're standing
on it is a miracle in itself.

643
00:33:00,530 --> 00:33:02,300
I thought he was good.
I thought you said you were good at it?

644
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:04,260
The kings of the acupuncture mat.

645
00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:06,190
Lee Kwang Soo, you know
what you have to do, right?

646
00:33:06,190 --> 00:33:07,900
I sleep on a mat like this.

647
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:10,960
- I sleep naked on a mat like this.
- You're a master at this?

648
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:13,650
Are you a master?
I had no idea.

649
00:33:13,650 --> 00:33:15,570
You promised, okay?

650
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:19,290
- I'm perfectly fine.
- Really?

651
00:33:22,150 --> 00:33:23,960
- That really hurts.
- You want me to go first?

652
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:26,950
There's no time.
Five, four, three...

653
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:31,530
- Fighting!
- Let's go!

654
00:33:31,530 --> 00:33:32,920
Challenge!

655
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:42,130
[Along with a ferocious battle cry!
Huh?]

656
00:33:43,650 --> 00:33:46,220
[Slow video mode?]

657
00:33:46,990 --> 00:33:49,920
[One step, two steps, three steps.]

658
00:33:57,220 --> 00:33:59,250
[1.7m. The lowest record.]

659
00:33:59,250 --> 00:34:01,090
You're even worse than Ji Hyo.

660
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:06,560
- Why are you playing around?
- It really hurts.

661
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:07,640
[Big-nosed Brother's turn.]

662
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:08,960
Challenge!

663
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:12,890
[Enduring the pain to run...]

664
00:34:12,890 --> 00:34:15,220
[And just keeps going forward?]

665
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:20,810
[Just as they're nicknamed, they are
the kings of the acupuncture mat.]

666
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:24,760
[My hand...]

667
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:28,770
Kwang Soo...
he has to jump 20m by himself.

668
00:34:28,770 --> 00:34:31,550
- Okay, I'm going to jump.
- You can do this.

669
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:33,420
[Giraffe showing his confidence
on top of the acupuncture mat.]

670
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:34,960
Kwang Soo!

671
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,530
Hey, Giraffe!

672
00:34:40,410 --> 00:34:42,990
[A serious warm-up...]

673
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,440
- Challenge!
- Okay, nice!

674
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,610
[Wait... you're starting off there?]

675
00:34:50,610 --> 00:34:51,910
Fighting!

676
00:34:52,770 --> 00:34:53,850
Nice, Kwang Soo!

677
00:34:53,850 --> 00:34:57,030
[An energetic start off.]

678
00:34:57,030 --> 00:34:59,420
- You can do this!
- Kwang Soo!

679
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:08,820
[Starting off much further back
than anyone else...]

680
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:11,660
[Using his long legs to take
three huge bounds.]

681
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:15,750
Foul...

682
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:24,720
[Ah... he went over the line...]

683
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,250
He stepped over the line.

684
00:35:27,790 --> 00:35:29,720
[Giraffe is disqualified.]

685
00:35:30,510 --> 00:35:33,150
[Giraffe's dead run
which ends up being disqualified.]

686
00:35:33,650 --> 00:35:35,650
- What?
- That was a foul.

687
00:35:35,650 --> 00:35:37,430
How can you mess that up?

688
00:35:41,410 --> 00:35:45,140
<i>Okay, everyone... one person
of each three member team...</i>

689
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:47,240
<i>I will allow one person
to wear socks.</i>

690
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:49,540
[Only one person from each team
will be allowed to wear socks.]

691
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:51,850
- No socks. Forget it.
- Let's not wear the socks.

692
00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:53,920
We don't need it.
Let's just do it as is.

693
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:56,420
- Why are you saying no to socks?
- Just do it as is!

694
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:59,430
You two are the only ones opposing
the idea when everyone else is agreeing.

695
00:35:59,430 --> 00:36:01,470
- What do you think?
- What is their problem?

696
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:03,010
- I'll wear the socks.
- Whatever.

697
00:36:05,410 --> 00:36:07,250
[Unbelievable]

698
00:36:08,610 --> 00:36:10,680
- Bo Young is so good at it...
- You're something else!

699
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:14,020
- Bo Young's already good at it.
- You are good though, Bo Young.

700
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:15,920
Since you're wearing socks then,
you have to jump 8m.

701
00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:19,340
If you still do bad with your socks on,
I'm not going to let you get away with it.

702
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:22,410
- You won't get away with it.
- I won't wear them then. I won't.

703
00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:23,930
- Wear it.
- I'll just do it barefoot.

704
00:36:23,930 --> 00:36:26,010
Why are you burdening me like that?

705
00:36:26,010 --> 00:36:27,640
Seriously...

706
00:36:29,370 --> 00:36:31,990
[Green Team decides to give the advantage
to their hope, Sang Yoon.]

707
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:33,880
What's the deal with this team?

708
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:36,480
- Kwang Soo's putting socks on over his shoes!
- No, I'm not!

709
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:39,810
Kwang Soo's putting his
socks on over his shoes.

710
00:36:39,810 --> 00:36:40,990
[What is he doing?]

711
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:43,280
- His feet are just swollen.
- I'm going to wear the socks.

712
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:46,780
- My feet are just huge to begin with.
- I saw him!

713
00:36:49,410 --> 00:36:51,920
How is it...
it gets more painful as you go.

714
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,850
Do you know why the pain
gets worse as you go?

715
00:36:53,850 --> 00:36:55,970
- Why?
- Because you're aggravating the same spots.

716
00:36:57,500 --> 00:37:00,160
- You think I don't know that?
- You're aggravating the same spots.

717
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,760
- You think I don't know that?
- What did you say?

718
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:05,280
I'm sorry to tell you this,
but bickering is my thing!

719
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:10,510
Ji Hyo... if you can jump 7m,
we can do this.

720
00:37:10,510 --> 00:37:13,710
- How can I jump 7m?
- You can do it! Why not?

721
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:15,820
Jong Kook only jumped 6m.

722
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:17,230
Okay, no need to get mad.

723
00:37:17,970 --> 00:37:19,860
- You can do it, Ji Hyo.
- Yes, you of all people can do it.

724
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:21,850
- Give it a try, Ji Hyo.
- Ji Hyo, start from back here.

725
00:37:22,410 --> 00:37:25,460
- I'm just going to jump from here.
- Okay.

726
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:27,420
[As a man...]

727
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:29,670
- She's got you whipped.
- You do whatever you'd like.

728
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:34,650
[Will she be able to jump
properly this time?]

729
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:38,080
If you jump in place like this,
your feet get used to it and hurt less.

730
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:41,790
[This coach is ferocious...]

731
00:37:41,790 --> 00:37:44,660
She's the world champion
amongst all the women.

732
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:46,390
Having both of you act like this on
my team is just too much.

733
00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:48,660
Is it your normal behavior
to disregard others like this?

734
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:52,730
- Coach Lee is not like that.
- You like to impose, don't you?

735
00:37:52,730 --> 00:37:54,820
No, it's not like that.
You do whatever you want.

736
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:57,340
[Coach Lee lashes out.]

737
00:37:57,810 --> 00:38:01,350
Why are you angering her?
And just let it go if you can.

738
00:38:02,170 --> 00:38:05,000
[She was just trying to help...]

739
00:38:05,010 --> 00:38:07,840
- Coach Lee was just trying to help.
- I know that.

740
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,680
- Are you embarrassed of me?
- No, I'm not.

741
00:38:11,270 --> 00:38:13,830
She asks him if he's
embarrassed of her.

742
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:16,730
- My dream is to become more like you.
- Mommy!

743
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:19,230
Challenge!

744
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:24,340
- One, two, three.
- That was a good jump.

745
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:26,450
[Wow... 4m?]

746
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:28,780
[Blank Ji - 4.4m]

747
00:38:29,370 --> 00:38:31,440
[Next up is Sang Yoon Long Legs
with sock clad feet.]

748
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:35,110
Your feet don't hurt, they don't hurt.
Your reputation is on the line.

749
00:38:35,410 --> 00:38:38,410
[Will he be able to surpass
his previous record?]

750
00:38:38,410 --> 00:38:40,050
His socks match his hat.

751
00:38:40,050 --> 00:38:41,870
I've never known anyone like that.

752
00:38:45,730 --> 00:38:48,150
[Flies through the air with his socks on...]

753
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:52,100
- 8m?
- 8m is a lot!

754
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:54,110
[A whopping 8.1m!]

755
00:38:54,110 --> 00:38:56,170
Let's please get this over with!

756
00:38:57,150 --> 00:38:58,210
Challenge.

757
00:38:58,210 --> 00:39:01,800
[Must jump a minimum of 7.5m
for them to succeed.]

758
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,710
- Good luck, Gary.
- Someone needs to succeed.

759
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:09,120
[Random Mr. Capable, Kang Gary...
could today be the day?]

760
00:39:11,130 --> 00:39:13,440
[He's in the air...]

761
00:39:19,830 --> 00:39:21,430
[Amazing!]

762
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:25,160
[Seems as though he flew over 8m!]

763
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:36,130
- Amazing.
- That was an awesome jump.

764
00:39:36,130 --> 00:39:38,250
- Unbelievable.
- He did it.

765
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:44,860
[Wow!
A whopping 9.3m!]

766
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:49,210
Kang Gary!
Kang Gary!

767
00:39:49,210 --> 00:39:50,370
We did it!

768
00:39:50,370 --> 00:39:52,660
[This is the random power!]

769
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:55,350
- Great job.
- Kang Gary, you're the best!

770
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:59,070
- However...
- Did he overstep the line?

771
00:39:59,070 --> 00:40:00,910
No, he didn't go over the line.
I saw it.

772
00:40:00,910 --> 00:40:02,410
- He overstepped the line?
- No, he didn't.

773
00:40:02,410 --> 00:40:04,980
Song Ji Hyo's jump was disqualified.

774
00:40:05,930 --> 00:40:07,960
[What...]

775
00:40:12,030 --> 00:40:13,430
[Blank Ji's overstepping
the line by a margin.]

776
00:40:13,430 --> 00:40:17,180
You should've told us sooner!
Then I would've jumped 15m!

777
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:20,580
[How can this be...]

778
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:24,510
[His random power isn't something
that comes to find him all the time...]

779
00:40:24,510 --> 00:40:26,410
I'm so sorry.

780
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:30,370
- I'm sorry, Gary.
- No, it's okay.

781
00:40:30,370 --> 00:40:31,530
Let's do this!

782
00:40:31,530 --> 00:40:33,990
[Yellow Team's turn at the challenge.]

783
00:40:33,990 --> 00:40:37,100
I can't believe I have to do this again.
I'm going to have to do that again.

784
00:40:38,850 --> 00:40:39,910
Challenge!

785
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:42,530
This is comfortable know.

786
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:45,520
Suk Jin, the bottom of your
feet look funny.

787
00:40:46,330 --> 00:40:48,900
[Did he discover the Yellow Team's trick
with those hawk-like eyes of his?]

788
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:50,620
- Something's strange.
- Just run, just run!

789
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:53,700
[Stopping his further advancement.]

790
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:55,570
- Something's not right.
- Grab him.

791
00:40:55,570 --> 00:40:58,960
- Do you have insoles in there?
- Why are your feet so thick looking?

792
00:41:00,690 --> 00:41:03,930
- What are you doing?
- I can't believe you have this in there.

793
00:41:03,930 --> 00:41:07,430
- What is this about?
- What are you doing?

794
00:41:07,430 --> 00:41:09,660
Isn't there a break for senior citizens?

795
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:12,930
What are you doing?
Your socks are already thick enough.

796
00:41:14,790 --> 00:41:16,300
- Lets get it done this time.
- Fighting.

797
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:17,940
- Let get it done this time.
- We can do it.

798
00:41:17,950 --> 00:41:19,760
Bo Young, why don't you
wear the socks?

799
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,480
- No, that's okay.
- You don't want to?

800
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:25,530
- I can do it without the socks.
- Then I'll jump 6m.

801
00:41:25,530 --> 00:41:27,380
- She's good enough as is.
- 6m isn't going to be enough.

802
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:28,380
Okay, 7m then.

803
00:41:28,390 --> 00:41:31,180
I can't believe I'm stuck with
these two competitive people.

804
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:32,570
[Suffocating level of competitiveness.]

805
00:41:32,570 --> 00:41:35,100
They're like a pair of coaching siblings.

806
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:37,540
Do I look like some sort of
an athlete to you?

807
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:40,570
Then just do it right.
You're even wearing socks.

808
00:41:40,570 --> 00:41:43,120
They're treating me
like an athlete in training.

809
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:44,920
Seriously...

810
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:47,380
Okay, Coach Lee Bo Young is
going to start first for us.

811
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:50,080
[Coach Lee's challenge.]

812
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:52,060
Hang on.
I haven't loosened up my feet yet.

813
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,940
[Coach Lee's adamant insistence
on proper stretching techniques.]

814
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:56,640
- Go ahead.
- Go ahead, and loosen up.

815
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:58,570
- I have to get my feet used to it first.
- Okay.

816
00:41:58,570 --> 00:42:01,030
Just do what you did earlier.

817
00:42:01,030 --> 00:42:03,730
- You have to do better. You need to do well.
- Okay, I'll do it this time.

818
00:42:04,530 --> 00:42:06,070
Seriously.

819
00:42:06,070 --> 00:42:09,320
- Seriously...
- Take off your socks and get on the mat.

820
00:42:09,330 --> 00:42:10,650
You want me to stand up here?

821
00:42:10,650 --> 00:42:12,740
[Coach Lee's fierce training style.]

822
00:42:13,330 --> 00:42:15,690
- She's scary.
- Is she number one?

823
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:17,810
- Yes, she's number one.
- My feet are good now. Challenge.

824
00:42:17,810 --> 00:42:19,000
Challenge!

825
00:42:21,090 --> 00:42:22,450
Be careful, Coach Lee.

826
00:42:22,450 --> 00:42:24,010
[Coach Lee doesn't even hesitate.]

827
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:28,000
I saw that glint in her eyes.

828
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:31,110
[Did she jump further than 5m?]

829
00:42:31,110 --> 00:42:32,760
How far did I jump?

830
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:36,590
- She doesn't even sit down.
- Your distance was 5.2m.

831
00:42:36,590 --> 00:42:38,890
- How far did she jump?
- 5.2m?

832
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:40,850
She jumped further than you.

833
00:42:40,860 --> 00:42:43,110
- How did she do that?
- That's amazing.

834
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:45,530
Challenge.

835
00:42:45,530 --> 00:42:47,500
You have to do well this time.

836
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:50,120
[Will he be able to recover
his reputation this time?]

837
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:55,540
[Running at full speed...]

838
00:42:55,540 --> 00:42:57,590
[Wow! Pretty far!]

839
00:42:58,830 --> 00:43:00,250
[Good job]

840
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:05,390
Please do something about
the soles of my feet.

841
00:43:05,390 --> 00:43:07,840
Ugh, that hurts!
That hurts so bad!

842
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:09,860
Ugh, that really hurts!

843
00:43:10,610 --> 00:43:13,710
<i>Yoo Jae Suk's record was 7.1m.</i>

844
00:43:13,710 --> 00:43:15,120
[Wow... 7.1m.]

845
00:43:15,130 --> 00:43:18,120
- That's a good jump.
- You need to jump 7.7m.

846
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:20,460
[But his walk back is a little...]

847
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:23,460
[Is he slow dancing?]

848
00:43:25,190 --> 00:43:26,860
- Hey, Gary...
- Yo!

849
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:31,290
Are you doing the crooked man dance?

850
00:43:32,250 --> 00:43:33,430
Okay, here I go.

851
00:43:33,430 --> 00:43:36,230
[If Coach Kkuk can jump a minimum of
7.7m, then his team succeeds.]

852
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:41,330
Jong Kook's really determined right now.

853
00:43:51,710 --> 00:43:53,990
[Did he pull it off?]

854
00:43:53,990 --> 00:43:58,620
[Did he jump over 7.7m?]

855
00:44:00,530 --> 00:44:02,400
<i>8.1m!</i>

856
00:44:02,410 --> 00:44:05,350
[Wow... 8.1m!]

857
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:09,800
<i>You've succeeded with a
total record of 20.4m.</i>

858
00:44:16,940 --> 00:44:19,920
[Pink Team wins
three running balls each.]

859
00:44:19,930 --> 00:44:22,960
- Don't you think this is unfair?
- This is too much.

860
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:25,210
How can you keep coming in at
first place like that?

861
00:44:25,210 --> 00:44:27,400
<i>And the Green Team is
in second place.</i>

862
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:29,130
[With second highest record,
Green Team comes in at second place.]

863
00:44:29,130 --> 00:44:30,940
- Lee Kwang Soo?
- Yes.

864
00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:32,030
Here's one for you.

865
00:44:32,030 --> 00:44:35,700
[Yellow Team each receives one ball
for participating in the game.]

866
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:37,140
- There aren't any more?
- No, there aren't.

867
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:41,020
[Third mission location-
'S' restaurant in Non Hyun-Dong.]

868
00:44:41,020 --> 00:44:42,240
What is this?

869
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:47,880
- There are so many delicious looking things.
- Look at this!

870
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:54,550
[All sorts of different dishes
when they're so hungry?]

871
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:01,880
Seeing how there are things written...

872
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:05,770
<i>Everyone must find a table that corresponds
to your team color and sit down.</i>

873
00:45:05,770 --> 00:45:07,780
- One per table?
- Yes, and in any random order.

874
00:45:08,420 --> 00:45:11,340
- Bo Young already ate a lot before she came.
- Yes, she did.

875
00:45:11,340 --> 00:45:15,010
I thought we were going to be running
all day, so I filled up before I came.

876
00:45:15,010 --> 00:45:17,810
She said she gets really cranky
when she gets hungry.

877
00:45:17,810 --> 00:45:20,330
I know Bo Young a little bit,
and she tends to be very impatient.

878
00:45:20,330 --> 00:45:25,020
And she tends to have that bit of crankiness
that all beautiful women seem to possess.

879
00:45:25,900 --> 00:45:32,530
[With all this bounty around,
what kind of a game will this be?]

880
00:45:32,530 --> 00:45:33,930
What is this?

881
00:45:33,930 --> 00:45:37,560
[Time to reveal the third mission.]

882
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:41,470
<i>Lee Kwang Soo, Song Ji Hyo,
and Yoo Jae Suk, please stand up.</i>

883
00:45:41,470 --> 00:45:42,930
- Why?
- You want us to get up?

884
00:45:42,930 --> 00:45:47,460
<i>There are 70 different types of food.
I want you to head over to the buffet...</i>

885
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:49,370
70 different types of food?

886
00:45:49,370 --> 00:45:51,090
<i>Of those 70 dishes in the line...</i>

887
00:45:51,090 --> 00:45:56,760
<i>I want you to pick out 25 dishes each
to bring back to the table of your choice.</i>

888
00:45:56,770 --> 00:45:58,920
- Of our choice?
- Bring back whatever you'd like.

889
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:05,430
[However, you can't discuss what
kind of a dish will be brought back.]

890
00:46:06,870 --> 00:46:11,180
[Cannot know what
each other are bringing back.]

891
00:46:11,780 --> 00:46:14,930
Spaghetti.
But the amount is too tiny.

892
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:19,110
Look, there's a giraffe up here.

893
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:20,830
Can I choose this too?

894
00:46:22,210 --> 00:46:25,100
[Must bring back the food in a way
that no one can tell what they are.]

895
00:46:26,210 --> 00:46:28,190
[Bo Young concentrates on the fruit line.]

896
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:36,240
[Sang Yoon concentrates on the meat.]

897
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:37,710
Orange!

898
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:40,120
Grapes.

899
00:46:41,190 --> 00:46:43,730
[Mr. Capable concentrating
on the healthy food.]

900
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:48,290
[Starving Gary.]

901
00:46:52,210 --> 00:46:55,730
[Sharp and painful screams
in front of the food items.]

902
00:46:58,040 --> 00:46:59,570
Where have you been all my life?

903
00:47:05,010 --> 00:47:07,340
Deep fried sweet potato.

904
00:47:07,870 --> 00:47:11,540
[All the members complete picking out
25 menu items each.]

905
00:47:12,020 --> 00:47:14,480
<i>I will reveal your next
mission to you.</i>

906
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:18,840
<i>The name of this game is...
Buffet Bingo.</i>

907
00:47:20,810 --> 00:47:24,420
<i>The food items that you each
have on the tray...</i>

908
00:47:24,420 --> 00:47:27,430
<i>you'll notice that each of your tables
are divided into 25 different compartments.</i>

909
00:47:27,430 --> 00:47:29,510
<i>Please place your food items
into each of those compartments.</i>

910
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:33,140
- You have to be careful about the placement.
- This is the craziest bingo ever.

911
00:47:33,140 --> 00:47:36,010
I bet we can get full from
eating our table.

912
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:41,420
- This is going to be too easy.
- It's going to be a double line bingo.

913
00:47:41,420 --> 00:47:44,010
<i>Once you get two lines, shout out, 'Bingo'
and you can step out of the game.</i>

914
00:47:44,020 --> 00:47:45,640
We can step out of the game
after two lines?

915
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:49,890
[Fruit heavy, healthy food heavy,
and a kid-like palate.]

916
00:47:49,890 --> 00:47:54,660
[Carnivorous menu, just plain hungry,
and epicurean taste buds.]

917
00:47:54,660 --> 00:47:59,600
[Omnivorous, Omnivorous, Omnivorous.]

918
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:04,290
[Going first is more advantageous.
Pink Team's Bo Young to start.]

919
00:48:04,290 --> 00:48:08,600
<i>Bo Young can start by describing the dish
and then eat it afterward.</i>

920
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:10,990
If Bo Young calls out something and if
I have it too, do I eat it as well?

921
00:48:10,990 --> 00:48:12,540
- Of course.
- Everyone will eat it together.

922
00:48:12,540 --> 00:48:15,170
- And if I eat it, I take away the dish?
- That's correct.

923
00:48:15,180 --> 00:48:16,910
- Okay.
- Do a good job, Lee Bo Young!

924
00:48:16,910 --> 00:48:18,690
Can I have some soy sauce?

925
00:48:20,180 --> 00:48:22,410
<i>Can we get some
soy sauce over here?</i>

926
00:48:23,020 --> 00:48:26,020
- Then can I get a cola?
- Spicy pepper sauce!

927
00:48:26,020 --> 00:48:28,400
Then I'll take a mineral water.

928
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:31,350
I can't eat the sushi by itself.

929
00:48:31,350 --> 00:48:33,840
- You're saying sushi then?
- No, I'm not!

930
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:36,160
I have a lot of other things on here.
I'm going to go with grapes.

931
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:37,330
<i>Once you mention the food,
we have to go with that one.</i>

932
00:48:37,330 --> 00:48:39,370
- Grapes.
- Grapes?

933
00:48:39,380 --> 00:48:41,550
- Grapes?
- Are we starting?

934
00:48:41,550 --> 00:48:44,020
- Grapes!
- Grapes!

935
00:48:44,050 --> 00:48:46,540
- Grapes!
- Grapes!

936
00:48:46,540 --> 00:48:48,150
I should've grabbed it!

937
00:48:48,150 --> 00:48:50,170
<i>If you ate it, then pull out the dish.</i>

938
00:48:51,020 --> 00:48:52,780
Do I not have any grapes?

939
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:54,430
Grapes?

940
00:48:54,430 --> 00:48:57,480
[Quite a few people who did not
grab any grapes.]

941
00:48:57,480 --> 00:48:59,930
- Okay, grapes!
- Okay, grapes.

942
00:49:01,330 --> 00:49:02,860
- Sweet and sour pork.
- What?

943
00:49:02,860 --> 00:49:04,620
- Sweet and sour pork.
- Yeah!

944
00:49:04,620 --> 00:49:07,850
- Sweet and sour pork.
- Sweet and sour pork!

945
00:49:07,850 --> 00:49:09,680
- Sweet and sour pork.
- Sweet and sour pork.

946
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:12,090
You can't leave out
the sweet and sour pork at a buffet!

947
00:49:12,090 --> 00:49:13,580
Everyone's favorite,
sweet and sour pork!

948
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:15,500
- Kim Jong Kook...
- Yeah?

949
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:16,920
- You don't have sweet and sour pork, do you?
- No, I don't.

950
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:18,550
Nice!

951
00:49:18,550 --> 00:49:20,440
[I hate fried food.]

952
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:22,040
You're finished!

953
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:24,150
Jae Suk already got rid of two?

954
00:49:25,150 --> 00:49:27,620
What you call out is important too.
I get it now.

955
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:31,400
[Must call out the food that their own
team mate likely would've brought back.]

956
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:33,220
I don't think this is
going to be good for me.

957
00:49:34,210 --> 00:49:36,650
- Where should I go? This way or that way?
- Kim Jong Kook, what have you got?

958
00:49:36,650 --> 00:49:38,990
- Is it my turn?
- It's Suk Jin's turn.

959
00:49:38,990 --> 00:49:40,080
Here I go.

960
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:45,280
- Grilled eel.
- There you go!

961
00:49:46,010 --> 00:49:49,840
[The food of stamina
that many of the men had chosen.]

962
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:51,130
I have the grilled eel.

963
00:49:51,130 --> 00:49:54,340
You can't call that out.
Of course, Jong Kook would have that.

964
00:49:54,340 --> 00:49:56,080
Of course, I'd have the eel.

965
00:49:56,590 --> 00:49:58,580
[I didn't pick the eel.]

966
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:01,620
[What will Jong Kook choose?]

967
00:50:01,620 --> 00:50:09,690
- Tofu!
- Tofu!

968
00:50:09,690 --> 00:50:12,830
- Tofu! I chose tofu, Jae Suk!
- Tofu!

969
00:50:12,830 --> 00:50:16,030
- Where was it? I didn't see the tofu.
- Bo Young, don't you have tofu?

970
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:19,760
- Bo Young, you didn't get tofu?
- I don't like beans.

971
00:50:20,370 --> 00:50:23,280
[Coach Lee with a picky palate.]

972
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:26,580
- Okay... pepper!
- Yeah!

973
00:50:26,580 --> 00:50:29,720
Who eats peppers at a buffet?

974
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:31,910
I eat it!

975
00:50:33,270 --> 00:50:37,690
I eat peppers at a buffet!
[Herbivore Giraffe is enjoying his pepper.]

976
00:50:37,690 --> 00:50:40,690
- Seriously...
- Who eats that at a buffet?

977
00:50:42,630 --> 00:50:45,620
- Who eats peppers at a buffet?
- It's good. I'm even hungrier now.

978
00:50:45,620 --> 00:50:47,320
- Everyone finished?
- Yes.

979
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:49,140
- Please, please...
- Come on, Dong Hoon!

980
00:50:49,140 --> 00:50:51,370
I have to pick something
no one would have.

981
00:50:51,370 --> 00:50:53,730
- Please...
- Jjamppong!

982
00:50:53,730 --> 00:50:55,440
- Yeah!
- Yes!

983
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:58,580
- Jjamppong!
- Yeah!

984
00:50:58,580 --> 00:51:00,920
- Jjamppong!
- Dong Hoon, jjamppong!

985
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:03,440
- Jjamppong!
- I have jjamppong!

986
00:51:03,450 --> 00:51:08,640
- There was jjamppong up there?
- I didn't take one because it was cold.

987
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:10,510
[Who knew their tastes would
differ so much?]

988
00:51:10,510 --> 00:51:12,980
It's still delicious even though it's cold.

989
00:51:13,460 --> 00:51:15,640
- I didn't choose the right ones.
- These two right now...

990
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:18,280
- What are they doing?
- Why are they so quiet?

991
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:22,560
- Why aren't they eating anything?
- Our preferences are so different.

992
00:51:23,340 --> 00:51:25,290
- Okay, here I go.
- Go for it!

993
00:51:25,290 --> 00:51:27,670
- Strawberry!
- Strawberry!

994
00:51:28,340 --> 00:51:31,920
Strawberry!
[Finally! I have this one!]

995
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:35,350
- Strawberry!
- I have it too! I can eat it?

996
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:38,400
- Eat it!
- Strawberry! I love it!

997
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:39,440
I have it!

998
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:41,850
[Sang Yoon finally gets to eat something!]

999
00:51:41,850 --> 00:51:43,160
I...

1000
00:51:43,580 --> 00:51:46,000
- Kimbap!
- Nice!

1001
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:49,000
- Kimbap!
- Nice!

1002
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,810
[Kimbap, a regular at a buffet line!]

1003
00:51:51,810 --> 00:51:54,710
- Kimbap!
- Do you not have kimbap?

1004
00:51:54,710 --> 00:51:56,880
- No, I don't.
- Song Ji Hyo, your taste buds are like mine.

1005
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:59,040
- Kimbap!
- I had a feeling that was going to come.

1006
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:01,160
Everyone's food preference is
so different from mine.

1007
00:52:01,790 --> 00:52:04,230
- Jae Suk, did you free up a lot of space?
- What?

1008
00:52:04,230 --> 00:52:06,210
- Did you get a lot already?
- I've got a lot.

1009
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:08,970
- Okay, it's Lee Kwang Soo's turn.
- I'll go.

1010
00:52:08,970 --> 00:52:10,800
Kwang Soo, you know which one, right?

1011
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:12,540
- I'll go with that one, Suk Jin.
- Okay.

1012
00:52:12,540 --> 00:52:14,730
- Pickled radish!
- What?

1013
00:52:15,770 --> 00:52:17,860
I got it!
Pickled radish!

1014
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:23,180
Who picks pickled radish?
[Bo Young has it!]

1015
00:52:23,180 --> 00:52:25,460
What's wrong with pickled radish?

1016
00:52:25,810 --> 00:52:29,870
- Bo Young!
- Who eats pickled radish at a buffet?

1017
00:52:29,870 --> 00:52:33,030
Bo Young!
Tell us if you have it.

1018
00:52:33,030 --> 00:52:36,700
I chose it because I thought I'd have it
after the rest of the meal

1019
00:52:36,700 --> 00:52:38,470
but I didn't think
we'd be eating it like this.

1020
00:52:38,470 --> 00:52:40,530
- Who picks pickled radish?
- I didn't even see it up there.

1021
00:52:40,540 --> 00:52:42,630
[I thought I'd be the only
one who'd have it.]

1022
00:52:42,630 --> 00:52:44,350
Bo Young, it's your turn.

1023
00:52:44,350 --> 00:52:46,270
- I pick chocolate.
- Yeah!

1024
00:52:46,270 --> 00:52:47,540
- Yeah!
- Chocolate!

1025
00:52:47,540 --> 00:52:51,520
- I thought you said you were on a diet!
- I was going to save this for dessert.

1026
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:53,560
- Who gets chocolate while on a diet?
- Chocolate!

1027
00:52:54,590 --> 00:53:00,430
[It's all great and all...
but are you keeping BINGO in mind?]

1028
00:53:02,970 --> 00:53:04,780
- Bo Young!
- You're not just eating randomly, right?

1029
00:53:04,780 --> 00:53:05,970
Bo Young!

1030
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,740
You didn't choose that because you were
craving sweets after the salty radish, right?

1031
00:53:08,740 --> 00:53:12,580
[She chose that because she was
craving sweets instead of BINGO?]

1032
00:53:12,580 --> 00:53:15,140
- Bo Young!
- Do you even know the rules?

1033
00:53:15,140 --> 00:53:19,650
- You can't just eat what you want.
- You have to follow the line.

1034
00:53:19,650 --> 00:53:21,880
- Sang Yoon, you're up next.
- I'm still chewing!

1035
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:24,150
- You're still chewing?
- Let's do this, Sang Yoon.

1036
00:53:24,150 --> 00:53:25,710
- Okay, my turn?
- Telepathy!

1037
00:53:25,710 --> 00:53:27,340
Jjajangmyun!

1038
00:53:27,340 --> 00:53:29,820
- What?
- There was Jjajangmyun up there?

1039
00:53:29,820 --> 00:53:31,560
- It was up there?
- Jjajangmyun was up there?

1040
00:53:31,560 --> 00:53:33,550
[That dish is too greasy...]

1041
00:53:34,460 --> 00:53:38,080
- I have to follow the line.
- I know Suk Jin's taste preferences.

1042
00:53:38,090 --> 00:53:39,520
- Here I go.
- Okay.

1043
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:43,100
- Hang on. Wait until Sang Yoon is done.
- Can't you eat it faster?

1044
00:53:43,100 --> 00:53:45,220
- I'm done eating.
- Okay.

1045
00:53:46,410 --> 00:53:48,880
[Such a good eater...]

1046
00:53:50,690 --> 00:53:54,290
[Battle of minds
getting fiercer by the minute.]

1047
00:53:54,290 --> 00:53:57,610
- Why isn't anyone calling this one out?
- It's time for someone to call this one.

1048
00:53:57,610 --> 00:53:59,850
- I really want to eat this one!
- I really want this one.

1049
00:53:59,850 --> 00:54:01,050
- Okay, here I go.
- Go ahead!

1050
00:54:01,420 --> 00:54:02,940
Everyone...

1051
00:54:03,940 --> 00:54:07,180
- Ripe persimmon!
- Ripe persimmon!

1052
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:11,280
Ripe persimmon, Ripe persimmon...

1053
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:13,380
- How is it that I don't have a single one?
- You don't have ripe persimmon?

1054
00:54:13,380 --> 00:54:16,150
- I have it!
- Ripe persimmon? Our whole team has it?

1055
00:54:16,150 --> 00:54:17,690
- Yes, our whole team has it.
- Nice.

1056
00:54:19,050 --> 00:54:22,880
[Needs two lines to win!
Jae Suk with one complete line.]

1057
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:24,080
Miss Blank?

1058
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:25,310
Ribs!

1059
00:54:25,310 --> 00:54:28,160
- Ribs!
- Ribs! Do you have ribs?

1060
00:54:28,170 --> 00:54:32,030
- Ribs!
- Ribs! Do you have ribs?

1061
00:54:32,030 --> 00:54:34,000
- Of course, I have ribs!
- Ribs!

1062
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,160
- Ribs!
- What? Ribs?

1063
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:38,050
- I don't have ribs.
- You don't?

1064
00:54:38,610 --> 00:54:40,270
I should've chose ribs.

1065
00:54:40,270 --> 00:54:43,060
- Ribs is a given at a buffet.
- Kwang Soo, it's your turn.

1066
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:45,230
- Kwang Soo, you know which one.
- Okay, here I go.

1067
00:54:45,930 --> 00:54:47,680
Everyone's favorite...

1068
00:54:50,210 --> 00:54:51,870
- Lettuce!
- What?

1069
00:54:51,870 --> 00:54:54,620
- Lettuce!
- I was going to pick lettuce...

1070
00:54:57,050 --> 00:54:58,900
Why are you always saying that
you almost did something?

1071
00:54:58,900 --> 00:55:01,230
- I really was going to!
- Stop trying and just do it!

1072
00:55:01,230 --> 00:55:03,500
What in the world did you bring?

1073
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:06,620
- I really was going to get lettuce.
- What did you bring? Air?

1074
00:55:06,620 --> 00:55:09,290
[No one else brought lettuce.]

1075
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:12,910
[Giraffe doing well
with his eclectic taste buds.]

1076
00:55:12,910 --> 00:55:14,690
- Bo Young?
- Yes?

1077
00:55:14,690 --> 00:55:15,820
- Bo Young!
- Go ahead.

1078
00:55:15,820 --> 00:55:17,200
- Is it my turn?
- Yes.

1079
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:19,780
- Then I choose tomato.
- Tomato!

1080
00:55:19,780 --> 00:55:21,870
- I pick tomato.
- Tomato!

1081
00:55:21,870 --> 00:55:25,620
- Tomato!
- I was going to pick that one too!

1082
00:55:25,620 --> 00:55:27,350
I was going back and forth
about grabbing one.

1083
00:55:28,770 --> 00:55:31,090
Bo Young and I have similar taste buds.

1084
00:55:32,430 --> 00:55:35,080
What are you talking about now?
You said she made you feel uncomfortable.

1085
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:36,180
No, we suit each other well.

1086
00:55:36,180 --> 00:55:39,850
[Coach Kkuk and Coach Lee
with their similar taste buds.]

1087
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:42,540
I... choose sushi.

1088
00:55:42,540 --> 00:55:48,230
- Sushi!
- Sushi!

1089
00:55:48,230 --> 00:55:49,410
[Finally!]

1090
00:55:49,860 --> 00:55:52,660
- I've really been wanting to eat the sushi.
- Sushi!

1091
00:55:52,660 --> 00:55:54,070
- I wish I had soy sauce.
- You want some soy sauce?

1092
00:55:54,070 --> 00:55:56,160
- Here you go.
- I already ate mine.

1093
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:58,550
- Can I have some soy sauce?
- I'll take some soy sauce.

1094
00:55:58,970 --> 00:56:01,450
- Just eat it plain.
- Give me the soy sauce.

1095
00:56:01,450 --> 00:56:04,450
[Can't eat sushi without the soy sauce.]

1096
00:56:04,450 --> 00:56:07,280
- It's good even without it.
- It's better without the soy sauce.

1097
00:56:07,630 --> 00:56:10,330
[What? Cola?]

1098
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:15,270
- Can I get some soy sauce, Jae Suk?
- Sure.

1099
00:56:16,100 --> 00:56:19,240
- I really want some soy sauce.
- Okay, hang on.

1100
00:56:19,250 --> 00:56:20,450
Here you go.

1101
00:56:20,450 --> 00:56:23,150
[Passing over the cola soy sauce.]

1102
00:56:24,890 --> 00:56:27,220
Do you really need the soy sauce
for one piece of sushi?

1103
00:56:27,230 --> 00:56:29,500
I bet everyone's lines are
pretty much similar by now.

1104
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:32,000
Do you guys think this is
a restaurant?

1105
00:56:33,490 --> 00:56:35,480
- What are you doing?
- What's going on?

1106
00:56:37,220 --> 00:56:39,360
I think Kwang Soo's been pranked.

1107
00:56:43,460 --> 00:56:47,360
Thank you for the bubbly soy sauce.

1108
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:50,150
I'll do a one shot with
the soy sauce.

1109
00:56:53,900 --> 00:56:55,830
- Sausage!
- Yay!

1110
00:56:55,830 --> 00:56:57,380
- Sausage!
- I like sausages!

1111
00:56:57,380 --> 00:57:00,530
- Egg rollups!
- Yay!

1112
00:57:00,530 --> 00:57:01,720
- Egg rollups!
- Egg rollups!

1113
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:04,250
- Dim Sum!
- Yeah!

1114
00:57:04,250 --> 00:57:06,750
- I'll go with a popular item.
- Okay, that one.

1115
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:07,980
Perelli leaves!

1116
00:57:07,980 --> 00:57:10,530
- What?
- No one has the perelli leaves, right?

1117
00:57:10,530 --> 00:57:12,390
- What?
- Did he just say, perelli leaves?

1118
00:57:12,390 --> 00:57:13,870
Everyone's favorite...

1119
00:57:15,910 --> 00:57:18,320
Chicken!

1120
00:57:21,110 --> 00:57:23,730
[Is that really chicken?]

1121
00:57:23,740 --> 00:57:26,330
- Do you have it?
- Just hurry up and eat it!

1122
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:30,740
Look at the way he's eating it.

1123
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:34,250
- Sang Yoon, you have it too?
- You're eating one too?

1124
00:57:37,190 --> 00:57:40,980
[I can eat much more than this...]

1125
00:57:41,670 --> 00:57:45,940
[After a full circle,
it's back to Bo Young.]

1126
00:57:45,940 --> 00:57:47,040
Sweet cinnamon drink.

1127
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:50,490
- Sweet cinnamon drink!
- Sweet cinnamon drink!

1128
00:57:52,980 --> 00:57:55,150
- Sweet cinnamon drink?
- I'm ruined.

1129
00:57:55,150 --> 00:57:56,600
Who would choose
sweet cinnamon drink?

1130
00:57:57,440 --> 00:57:59,630
[Jong Kook also has one complete line.]

1131
00:57:59,630 --> 00:58:01,320
- Is it my turn?
- Yes.

1132
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:03,500
Pickles.

1133
00:58:03,510 --> 00:58:05,310
- What?
- Did he say, pickles?

1134
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,710
[Giraffe also has the unique menu item.]

1135
00:58:10,710 --> 00:58:13,640
- Pickles?
- I have to finish this?

1136
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:16,110
You have to finish it.
[Even if it's sour, must eat the whole thing.]

1137
00:58:16,110 --> 00:58:18,850
Did you really choose pickles?

1138
00:58:18,850 --> 00:58:20,880
Ji Suk Jin, it's your turn.

1139
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:22,060
Here I go.

1140
00:58:22,580 --> 00:58:25,920
[Oh... close to two BINGO lines?]

1141
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:28,690
- Duck!
- Duck!

1142
00:58:28,690 --> 00:58:30,320
- Duck!

it's BINGO for me.
BINGO!

1146
00:58:37,860 --> 00:58:41,910
[How like Suk Jin...
being the brain that he is.]

1147
00:58:41,910 --> 00:58:43,640
- Congratulations.
- Fighting.

1148
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:45,650
You guys can't even do that?
Seriously...

1149
00:58:45,650 --> 00:58:47,830
Suk Jin, I guess you'll be waiting
by yourself again.

1150

[Even though he won first place,
it looks like he's heading off to jail...]

1151

I have a feeling someone else
is going to have this one.

1152
00:58:58,670 --> 00:59:00,360
I'm sure someone is going to have this.

1153
00:59:00,360 --> 00:59:01,640
Sweet pumpkin!

1154
00:59:02,070 --> 00:59:05,920
- I have it too, but...
- Sweet pumpkin!

1155
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:08,480
- By myself!
- I have it too.

1156
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:10,450
- I have it too!
- All our team members have it.

1157
00:59:13,460 --> 00:59:16,300
- I really don't want to do this one, but...
- Just do it.

1158
00:59:16,870 --> 00:59:20,330
- Tuna sushi!
- Tuna!

[Now if Kwang Soo can get a BINGO,
Yellow Team will win the game!]

1164

You're the only one left to go!

1165
00:59:43,250 --> 00:59:46,410
Have none of you ever played
BINGO before or something?

1166
00:59:46,860 --> 00:59:50,010
Mushrooms!
BINGO!

1167
00:59:50,010 --> 00:59:51,810
- What?
- Mushrooms?

[Jae Suk completes his two BINGO lines!]

1169
00:59:55,290 --> 00:59:58,090
I would've grabbed mushrooms.
But I didn't see that up there.

1170
00:59:58,090 --> 01:00:00,420
- You can't coach anyone.
- Can I finish the rest of my food?

1171
01:00:00,420 --> 01:00:02,390
- No.
- No, you can't.

1172
01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:03,790
Why not?

1173
01:00:04,630 --> 01:00:06,590
Those are the rules.
Why are you asking about it?

1174
01:00:07,410 --> 01:00:09,660
You can't leave an empty bowl on there.
It's to keep a record of it.

1175
01:00:10,610 --> 01:00:12,630
- All that is being kept track of.
- You can see this?

1176
01:00:12,630 --> 01:00:14,690
Don't you even know the basics
about filming a show?

1177
01:00:14,860 --> 01:00:17,350
There's such a thing called 'Insert Filming'.

[A lesson by broadcasting specialist, Gary.]

1179

- I'm sorry, I had forgotten about that.
- Is it my turn?

1180
01:00:24,100 --> 01:00:25,190
Yes.

1181

- Kwang Soo, you have to finish for us to win.

- Do I have a chance?

1188
01:00:48,290 --> 01:00:49,770
No, you don't.

1189
01:00:50,320 --> 01:00:53,530
- Kwang Soo, we can do this. Let's win.
- Let's get first place, Kwang Soo.

1190
01:00:53,530 --> 01:00:56,330
- Let's take three running balls.
- It's Kwang Soo's turn.

1191

Okay, it's my turn.
Spaghetti in tomato sauce!

1192
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:02,310
Spaghetti in tomato sauce!

1193
01:01:02,310 --> 01:01:04,740
I do have it here...

1194
01:01:06,110 --> 01:01:09,290

[At last, the Yellow Traitors Club wins!]

- The tomato sauce tastes...
- If it tastes weird, then don't eat it.

1198
01:01:21,740 --> 01:01:23,990
- Don't eat it.
- Don't eat it if it tastes weird.

1199

- Can I...
- What?

1200
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:28,460
Why?
It's good.

1201
01:01:28,460 --> 01:01:30,370
This is spicy noodles.

1202
01:01:30,380 --> 01:01:33,420
- This is spicy noodles.
- He just said he picked a wrong dish.

1203
01:01:33,420 --> 01:01:36,210
He shouted out spaghetti in tomato sauce
when it's actually spicy noodles.

the spicy noodle was the spaghetti...]

[Just when we thought he had won,
what the heck is this?]

1207
01:01:48,350 --> 01:01:50,560
- You already shouted it out.
- But it looks exactly alike!

1208
01:01:50,560 --> 01:01:52,370
You should've checked it more carefully.

1209

- That's not BINGO.

- I can't believe you did that.
- It looks so much alike!

1212

even happened.

[If he had shouted out 'Spicy noodles',
they would've won first place...]

- Kwang Soo's in last place now.

1216

- You're so frustrating!
- They look exactly alike.

- Spicy noodles!

- Me too.

You can't even tell the difference
between the two dishes?

1234

I was so shocked because the spicy noodles
suddenly started tasting like spaghetti.

1235
01:03:08,710 --> 01:03:11,520
You mean it should've tasted like spaghetti,
but it tasted like spicy noodles instead.

- You were in first place.
- Unbelievable...

spaghetti like that?

- Don't even joke.
- Sit in the back!

we have to wait another year!

I'm not going to play anymore.

- Then I'm not going to play anymore.
- Fine. Let's just end it then.

1301

I can either work very hard for this team,
or I can ruin this team too.

01:06:19,370 --> 01:06:21,130
Just think about when we first met.

1304
01:06:21,130 --> 01:06:22,270
When you say you want to end it...

1305
01:06:22,270 --> 01:06:24,810
don't you think you should think twice
before you say those words?

1306
01:06:24,810 --> 01:06:26,790
- No matter how angry we are...
- I never said I wanted to end it.

1307
01:06:26,790 --> 01:06:30,000
You're the one who's thinking that way,
and twisting the thoughts around like that.

1308
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,650
- I never said that we should end it.
- Please be quiet!

1309
01:06:36,600 --> 01:06:38,790
- Let's not be like this!
- What are we doing?

1310
01:06:38,790 --> 01:06:41,010
What are we becoming to each other?

1311
01:06:41,820 --> 01:06:43,740
Even if we were to gather our strength
together, it still wouldn't be enough.

1312
01:06:43,740 --> 01:06:45,250
Just what are we sitting here doing?

1313
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:53,190
[Final mission location-
Children's learning center in Gwanjingu.]

1314
01:06:53,190 --> 01:06:56,110
[Winning Pink Team is the first to arrive.]

1315
01:06:56,490 --> 01:07:00,460
<i>[Write down names on the balls you've
earned and enter them in the drawing.]</i>

1316
01:07:00,460 --> 01:07:02,700
<i>Couples will be determined
through a drawing</i>

1317
01:07:02,700 --> 01:07:05,010
<i>and the person left remaining
will become the seeker.</i>

1318
01:07:05,010 --> 01:07:07,310
<i>If the seeker breaks the couple's bracelet,
the couple will be ousted.</i>

1319
01:07:07,310 --> 01:07:09,650
<i>If the couple rips off the seeker's
name plate, the seeker must cease activity.</i>

1320
01:07:09,650 --> 01:07:10,940
<i>Time allotted will be an hour.</i>

1321
01:07:10,940 --> 01:07:14,170
<i>Either the last couple or the seeker
left remaining will be the ultimate winner.</i>

1322
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:16,320
Then the seeker has the advantage.

1323
01:07:16,320 --> 01:07:18,590
- There's only one seeker?
- There are nine of you right now, right?

1324
01:07:18,590 --> 01:07:22,610
<i>There will be four couples,
and the person remaining will be the seeker.</i>

1325
01:07:22,610 --> 01:07:24,010
- There's only one seeker?
- Yes.

1326
01:07:24,010 --> 01:07:26,100
Then one of us could be the seeker?

1327
01:07:26,110 --> 01:07:29,540
[Yellow Team arriving after the
explanation time is already over.]

1328
01:07:29,540 --> 01:07:31,910
- Would it be better to be the seeker?
- Maybe that'll be better.

1329
01:07:31,910 --> 01:07:33,850
If Jong Kook was the seeker,
then it'd be all over.

1330
01:07:33,850 --> 01:07:35,060
We can't have Jong Kook be the seeker.

1331
01:07:35,060 --> 01:07:37,250
Everyone should write down
Jong Kook's name at least once.

1332
01:07:37,250 --> 01:07:39,600
- No, don't do that.
- I should write down Jong Kook's name.

1333
01:07:40,080 --> 01:07:42,350
We can't have Jong Kook
be the seeker.

1334
01:07:43,250 --> 01:07:46,050
- Why did you write Bo Young's name?
- I just did.

1335
01:07:46,930 --> 01:07:49,790
What are you doing?

1336
01:07:49,790 --> 01:07:52,370
[Big-nosed Brother having wrote down
Bo Young's name as his hopeful partner.]

1337
01:07:52,370 --> 01:07:53,550
I just wrote her name, okay?

1338
01:07:53,550 --> 01:07:56,010
[All the members complete submitting
their balls in the drawing.]

1339
01:07:56,910 --> 01:08:00,360
[Each team waiting in separate
rooms inside the building.]

1340
01:08:00,360 --> 01:08:03,000
I wonder if they're going to
make the announcement on the TV.

1341
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:04,920
- I think you're right.
- I think they are.

1342
01:08:05,870 --> 01:08:08,500
[These staff members are preparing
to choose and announce the couples.]

1343
01:08:08,500 --> 01:08:10,740
[A familiar face.]

1344
01:08:13,150 --> 01:08:14,990
It's Hwan!

1345
01:08:15,610 --> 01:08:17,540
Look, there's Hwan.

1346
01:08:17,540 --> 01:08:22,180
Hello, this is Announcer Kim Hwan
to announce the fateful couples of the day.

1347
01:08:23,450 --> 01:08:27,250
[100% live broadcast.]

1348
01:08:27,250 --> 01:08:29,030
Hi, Announcer Kim Hwan!

1349
01:08:29,030 --> 01:08:33,820
By having a drawing of the running balls,
it will ensure 100% fairness in the drawing.

1350
01:08:33,820 --> 01:08:37,810
[The announcer guaranteeing and
vouching the fairness of the drawing.]

1351
01:08:37,810 --> 01:08:39,440
Please rest assured in the fairness.

1352
01:08:39,440 --> 01:08:41,790
- Of course,
- Yes, we'll follow!

1353
01:08:41,790 --> 01:08:43,150
<i>We will now begin the drawing.</i>

1354
01:08:43,150 --> 01:08:45,840
- I'm so nervous!
- This is nerve-wrecking.

1355
01:08:46,170 --> 01:08:49,820
<i>Judge Go Dong Wan,
please press the drawing button.</i>

1356
01:08:50,610 --> 01:08:54,000
Who will be our first lucky winner?

1357
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,910
Okay... the balls are still spinning.

1358
01:08:56,920 --> 01:08:58,920
The first lucky ball.

1359
01:08:58,920 --> 01:09:00,950
Who will be the lucky winner?

1360
01:09:00,950 --> 01:09:02,960
- There it is.
- They have a ball.

1361
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:05,040
Please don't let it be my name.

1362
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:07,150
Okay, it's this person that you see.

1363
01:09:07,150 --> 01:09:09,870
The first running ball
belongs to Song Ji Hyo!

1364
01:09:09,870 --> 01:09:13,500
[The first running ball belongs to...
Song Ji Hyo!]

1365
01:09:13,500 --> 01:09:16,940
- Song Ji Hyo is the first ball drawn.
- I didn't think she had many names.

1366
01:09:16,940 --> 01:09:19,290
Then the next person drawn is
coupled with Ji Hyo.

1367
01:09:19,290 --> 01:09:22,650
Just who will be Song Ji Hyo's partner?

1368
01:09:22,650 --> 01:09:25,700
Okay, the lucky ball...
we've got it.

1369
01:09:25,700 --> 01:09:27,620
- Please, please...
- Don't let it be me, don't let it be me!

1370
01:09:27,620 --> 01:09:31,780
[Who is the person that's going to be
coupled with Blank Ji?]

1371
01:09:31,790 --> 01:09:35,630
The second name is... Yoo Jae Suk!
Congratulations.

1372
01:09:35,630 --> 01:09:38,060
Ugh... that's an ace couple.

1373
01:09:38,060 --> 01:09:41,280
[First couple drawn,
Song Ji Hyo and Yoo Jae Suk.]

1374
01:09:41,280 --> 01:09:46,200
[They were recently coupled up on
'That Winter, That Typhoon Blows'.]

1375
01:09:46,200 --> 01:09:48,640
[What if he starts nagging me again?]

1376
01:09:50,270 --> 01:09:53,230
Just who will be on the next running ball?

1377
01:09:53,230 --> 01:09:55,550
Okay, we've got the ball,
so let's check who it belongs to.

1378
01:09:56,790 --> 01:10:01,130
The winner of the third running ball is,
Lee Bo Young! Congratulations.

1379
01:10:01,130 --> 01:10:03,010
[First person chosen to be a part of
the second couple is Lee Bo Young.]

1380
01:10:03,010 --> 01:10:04,110
We will go on to drawing the next ball.

1381
01:10:04,110 --> 01:10:08,560
[Who'll be Coach Lee's partner?]

1382
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:10,110
I'm getting a good feeling about this.

1383
01:10:10,690 --> 01:10:16,770
[Who's to be Bo Young's partner?]

1384
01:10:16,770 --> 01:10:19,910
Lee Bo Young's partner is...

1385
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:23,070
It's Ji Suk Jin.
Ji Suk Jin!

1386
01:10:23,070 --> 01:10:26,140
[Bo Young's partner?
Ji Suk Jin!]

1387
01:10:27,570 --> 01:10:29,710
[A partnership that's harder
for the bystanders to watch?]

1388
01:10:31,200 --> 01:10:35,120
[Bravo]

1389
01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:38,000
- How did that happen? Suk Jin!
- Suk Jin... congratulations!

1390
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,960
[A sincere round of well wishes
as if he's a groom about to be married.]

1391
01:10:40,960 --> 01:10:44,000
- I bet she's right now...
- Bo Young, you poor thing!

1392
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,250
[I guess I'm going to be
ousted early on...]

1393
01:10:46,250 --> 01:10:48,210
Fighting!
Bo Young, fighting.

1394
01:10:48,780 --> 01:10:51,080
Is it okay if I scream?

1395
01:10:53,130 --> 01:10:56,260
- Who did you get partnered up with?
- I'm partners with Ji Suk Jin.

1396
01:10:56,660 --> 01:10:59,570
[Everyone that hears the news breaks out
in laughter against their will...]

1397
01:10:59,570 --> 01:11:02,590
Can I switch partners and
team up with Ji Hyo instead?

1398
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,470
I hope Kim Jong Kook comes out
soon with a partner.

1399
01:11:07,250 --> 01:11:09,330
The first name for the third couple...

1400
01:11:10,730 --> 01:11:15,570
The first name drawn for the third couple is,
Lee Kwang Soo. Congratulations!

1401
01:11:15,580 --> 01:11:18,170
Lee Kwang Soo's partner is going to be...

1402
01:11:18,180 --> 01:11:24,210
and here it is, it's Kim Jong Kook!
Congratulations!

1403
01:11:24,210 --> 01:11:26,060
No way!

1404
01:11:26,320 --> 01:11:28,710
It's Kim Jong Kook!
Congratulations!

1405
01:11:30,010 --> 01:11:32,340
- Lee Kwang Soo and Kim Jong Kook...
- I'm all set!

1406
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:37,450
We are about to pick the final two names
for the fourth couple.

1407
01:11:37,750 --> 01:11:40,500
It's Kang Gary.
Congratulations!

1408
01:11:41,060 --> 01:11:42,380
As for the last remaining ball...

1409
01:11:42,380 --> 01:11:46,490
we are going to eliminate the balls that
belongs to people already chosen

1410
01:11:46,490 --> 01:11:48,670
and we will recommence the drawing
after that's been completed.

1411
01:11:49,650 --> 01:11:52,860
I only wrote down my name once
because I wanted to be the seeker.

1412
01:11:52,860 --> 01:11:55,410
[Haroro wanting to be the seeker
to hunt the rest of the members down.]

1413
01:11:55,410 --> 01:11:57,260
I really want to be the seeker.
I truly do.

1414
01:11:57,260 --> 01:12:01,200
I have this urge... this rage and urge
to get some sort of revenge.

1415
01:12:01,800 --> 01:12:06,000
Now that we've taken out all the other names,
there are three balls left in the drawing.

1416
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:09,640
This is a very nerve-wrecking situation.
We've got one remaining spot left.

1417
01:12:09,640 --> 01:12:11,930
This isn't going to be a simple drawing.

1418
01:12:13,020 --> 01:12:16,730
- There it is...
- We have the ball...

1419
01:12:17,180 --> 01:12:20,900
Okay, we've checked the name.
The fourth couple's final member is...

1420
01:12:20,910 --> 01:12:24,720
It's Lee Sang Yoon.
Congratulations!

1421
01:12:24,720 --> 01:12:27,400
Yeah! We don't even
have to go anywhere else.

1422
01:12:28,510 --> 01:12:29,940
Okay!

1423
01:12:32,690 --> 01:12:36,000
[Just as he had wished,
Ha Ha becomes the chosen seeker.]

1424
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,600
[I will show you all...]

1425
01:12:38,600 --> 01:12:42,070
<i>I will show them all what a
frightening person I can be.</i>

1426
01:12:42,620 --> 01:12:44,540
I'm not going to go easy
on any of them.

1427
01:12:47,750 --> 01:12:52,940
I hope that you make your escape before the
seeker comes after you with bells on.

1428
01:12:52,940 --> 01:12:56,300
Couple Hide and Seek... start!

1429
01:12:58,960 --> 01:13:03,630
[Welcome to Couple's Hell.]

1430
01:13:05,200 --> 01:13:06,710
<i>We have to hide.</i>

1431
01:13:06,710 --> 01:13:09,370
- Its nice outside.
- Oh my goodness.

1432
01:13:09,370 --> 01:13:12,370
[Couple Suk Jin and Bo Young
looking for a place to hide.]

1433
01:13:12,380 --> 01:13:14,050
We have to find a place.

1434
01:13:14,050 --> 01:13:16,700
- Are you a good runner?
- I'm a pretty good runner.

1435
01:13:16,710 --> 01:13:19,000
Because you have to assume that we're
going to get ousted if we get caught.

1436
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,120
Why?
We have to stop him!

1437
01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:24,330
But if he slams his hand down
on our wrist...

1438
01:13:28,350 --> 01:13:32,410
You better hide yourself well...
I think I see your hair strand!

1439
01:13:33,070 --> 01:13:35,070
You better hide yourself well!

1440
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:37,630
I think I see your hair strand!

1441
01:13:38,790 --> 01:13:41,430
You better hide yourself well!

1442
01:13:41,850 --> 01:13:46,400
I think I see your hair strand!

1443
01:13:49,480 --> 01:13:55,070
[All the couples in a state of panic
with crazy Haroro on the loose.]

1444
01:14:01,040 --> 01:14:05,380
[The terrorizing sound of the bell ringing
that they haven't heard in a while.]

1445
01:14:09,740 --> 01:14:12,740
[Starting to hunt them down
with fire in his eyes.]

1446
01:14:23,640 --> 01:14:25,640
Okay, let's just start running!

1447
01:14:31,080 --> 01:14:34,200
<i>Catch them!</i>

1448
01:14:38,860 --> 01:14:40,270
Jae Suk...

1449
01:14:42,150 --> 01:14:44,270
I'm so scared just standing here.

1450
01:14:45,080 --> 01:14:48,410
- Put your hand behind us like this.
- So he can't come between us?

1451
01:14:48,410 --> 01:14:51,110
That's right!
Then I can rip off his name tag.

1452
01:14:54,940 --> 01:14:57,110
[Taking on their opponents by brute force?]

1453
01:14:57,910 --> 01:15:01,580
[Using their VJ as a test subject
to try out their method of attack.]

1454
01:15:01,580 --> 01:15:02,790
And we can rip off the name like that.

1455
01:15:03,520 --> 01:15:06,180
[It looks as though they're planning
on attacking the seeker.]

1456
01:15:06,180 --> 01:15:08,120
Tiger-Giraffe-Cross!

1457
01:15:08,690 --> 01:15:12,110
To be honest,
we are the strongest couple out here.

1458
01:15:12,110 --> 01:15:13,150
He can't beat us.

1459
01:15:13,150 --> 01:15:15,210
If you grab onto him so
that he can't move...

1460
01:15:15,210 --> 01:15:17,070
That's right!
With your long arm.

1461

for the seeker...]

as soon as he's resurrected.]

1481

running away from them?

1482
01:17:11,060 --> 01:17:13,280

- Come down here!

See? He's about to get
his name ripped off again.

[Again?]

1491
01:17:39,180 --> 01:17:42,820
I'm glad you ripped it off!
Good job.

1492
01:17:42,820 --> 01:17:44,880
How am I supposed to oust
them like this?

1493
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:47,720

- Come on and let's do this!

1499

Let me oust at least one couple!

1500
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:25,140
[No matter how many times he gets up
the energy to attack again...]

1501

[Why aren't things going my way?]

1503
01:18:43,210 --> 01:18:45,340
I think I'm going to lose it.

1504
01:18:45,340 --> 01:18:49,140
[About to lose his sanity from
the rage and the resentment of it all.]

1505

[Chu Sung Hoon, please come back
on the show and get that man for me.]

1506

[Running Man Theater.
Stay strong, Dong Hoon...]

1508
01:19:10,210 --> 01:19:13,720
- I don't think we'll get ousted.
- I feel reassured. I feel untouchable.

1509
01:19:13,720 --> 01:19:16,260
- Is it different to be with them?
- Yes, it feels different.

1510
01:19:16,690 --> 01:19:19,790
[The couples feeling much more relaxed after
having witnessed the defeated looking seeker.]

1511
01:19:19,790 --> 01:19:21,790
We're going to end up ousting each other
while on the run at this rate.

1512

[Full speed chase!]

1513

[Seeker Ha Ha is different!]

1514

[Enraged Haroro!]

1516

[I will pay you back for the humiliation
and the insult from earlier!]

1517
01:19:47,690 --> 01:19:49,590
This isn't going to be easy this time.

1518

Get him in a headlock!

1519

[Seeker Ha Ha proposing a plan.]

1533

ounce of respect.

five minutes, it's couple against couple!]

and immediately attacks them!]
