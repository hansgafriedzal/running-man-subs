- Get away.
- You're the one who shouldn't touch it.

33
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:44,530

- Song Ji Hyo...

34
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:47,990

38
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:59,220

46
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,410
- What is that?
- Were you out drinking?

47
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:21,260
- With who?
- Who were you out drinking with?

48
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:22,620
What are you doing, Song Ji Hyo?

49
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:25,570
- Who is this? Where is this person?
- Who were you out drinking with?

50
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:27,370
- I wasn't out drinking!
- It says so right here!

51
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:29,570
It's asking you if you got home okay
after drinking the other night!

52
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:32,380
- I know! What is going on here?
- What is this all about?

53
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:35,760
From the looks of it,
several different people wrote these.

54
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,610
The way they expressed how they're going to
deplete Jong Kook of all his muscles...

55
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:41,370
This person obviously doesn't know
what they're talking about.

56
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:45,930
- The way they talk sounds so sleazy.
- Don't you think?

57
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:51,990
[Just then...]

58
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:55,840
[A swarm of people carrying a flag is seen
on the other side of the river?]

59
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:02,470
[Could these people be the challengers?]

60
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:04,840
How many people are there?

61
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,820
- Isn't that 'Laws of the Jungle' Team?
- 'Laws of the Jungle'?

62
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:14,510
- Is that Jin Woon?
- What is Dong Hoon doing?

63
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:23,700
[Laws of the Jungle Team: Kim Byung Man (C),
Jung Chul, Woo Jin, Hye Bin, Jin Woon, Ha Ha?]

64
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:25,900
[Why is Ha Ha with them?]

65
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:32,410
The Laws of the Jungle!

66
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:37,760
[They face all sorts of challenges and
defeat without any hesitation!]

67
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:43,020
[Champions of the wild having conquered
various jungles all over the world!]

68
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:46,920
[And now, they're here to
challenge the RM Team?]

69
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:52,610
Seriously, Jin Woon...

70
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:56,690
- Don't shake their hand, don't do it!
- Is there a need for all this animosity?

71
00:03:56,690 --> 00:03:59,290
[Drawing the boundary right from the start?]

72
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:01,490
- Don't try to act friendly towards us.
- Hello.

73
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:04,010
- That traitor.
- What are you looking at?

74
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:07,820
- Don't you know that I'm a master fighter?
- What?

75
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:10,160
- What is he doing there?
- One, two, three, four!

76
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:13,530
The Jung, the Jung...
The laws of the jungle!

77
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:17,000
- What are you doing, Dong Hoon?
- I see that he's betrayed us again.

78
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,480
- What?
- What team are you standing with?

79
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,400
[30 minutes ago.]

80
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,630
What's going on here?

81
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:27,740
When I was told to bring on one person
from our opposing team...

82
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:29,780
- you're the one who I thought of.
- There it is!

83
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:32,170
- Byung Man...
- Yeah?

84
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:34,140
I'll show you what
causing mischief is all about.

85
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:37,080
Betrayal is my middle name.

86
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:41,430
[And within moments,
he's already a part of their team.]

87
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:44,670
Do you even know who I am?

88
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:48,510
Don't talk to us right now. We're here
because we have something to say.

89
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:50,300
- What?
- What is it?

90
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:52,390
So why aren't you saying anything?

91
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:54,940
Why are they passing it off
to each other?

92
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,420
There's no need for us to even
say anything.

93
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:59,890
Let's just... have a go at it.

94
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,110
Oh yeah?

95
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:03,630
[You want to have a go at it?]

96
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:08,560
[Running Man vs. Laws of the Jungle.]

97
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,360
We'd like to challenge you!

98
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:12,300
We'd like to challenge you!

99
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:14,240
[Too weak.]

100
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:17,720
Your voice is so high pitched.
Your voice is higher pitched than mine.

101
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:21,850
As I've said before,
God doesn't give you everything.

102
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:26,680
These good-looking guys with their muscles...
just listen to their voices.

103
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:29,850
We'd like to challenge you!
[Is he mocking him?]

104
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:32,080
Kwang Soo for example...
he has a nice voice.

105
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,890
- Yes, he does.
- But God didn't give him the face.

106
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:35,210
Why are you being like that?

107
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:37,750
There's something else he didn't give him.
Something even more prominent than looks.

108
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:38,870
- What is that?
- A butt.

109
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:40,340
[God especially didn't give him a butt?]

110
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:42,670
- He has no butt!
- Why do you need to mention that?

111
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:43,900
His butt is just missing.

112
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:46,170
I really wish I could strip naked
right now.

113
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:48,580
It's because I feel so unjust
by what was just said!

114
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:52,040
But anyways... which one of you recently
went out drinking with Ji Hyo?

115
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:54,030
- Jin Woon.
- Jin Woon?

116
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:55,900
[What?
With Jin Woon?]

117
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:00,900
- You two...
- But you always tell us that you're busy!

118
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:04,830
- You don't even join us for dinner!
- When did I ever go out drinking with you?

119
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:08,780
Did you get home safely?

120
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,030
[Panic?]

121
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:27,930
- What's wrong with her?
- Gary...

122
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:29,990
- What are you going to do, Gary?
- How can you do this to us?

123
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:31,820
- You seriously are...
- Am I just for you to use on TV?

124
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:35,450
Stop calling me so much when
I'm busy working.

125
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,070
[An unfounded setup
putting Ji Hyo in hot water.]

126
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:45,580
[Battle mode - UP!]

127
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:51,540
All of us have already
marked one of you as our targets.

128
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:53,480
- Really?
- Isn't Jung Chul going for Suk Jin?

129
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,600
- I'm sure it is.
- No, I didn't mark him.

130
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,450
- Then who?
- Me.

131
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:01,520
In the time that I haven't seen you,
your face has aged a lot.

132
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:04,390
It's because of all my trips to the jungle.
You look like you could be my ancestor.

133
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:08,070
[Competitive right from the start.]

134
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:11,620
- Didn't you write something about Gary?
- What about you, Hye Bin?

135
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:13,320
I'm taking on Gary.

136
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:16,530
- Shouldn't you take on Ji Hyo?
- You should take on Ji Hyo.

137
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:18,610
Song Ji Hyo is mine.

138
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,750
You just wait and see.

139
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:25,240
Hye Bin is a rare treasure that we have
in the variety land.

140
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,470
- Remember Leesadon?
- Of course, I know Leesadon.

141
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,770
I heard that you could keep on spinning
for 24 hours straight.

142
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:31,830
- Wasn't that over 10 years ago?
- I can't spin like that anymore.

143
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:33,750
- Why?
- Because I've gotten too old for that.

144
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:37,370
- How can you say that you're old?
- All that spinning has made me anemic.

145
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:42,440
- Then who's Jung Chul taking on?
- Mr. Kwang Soo... I'm in charge of him.

146
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,490
Kwang Soo.

147
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:46,390
- Just call him Kwang Soo.
- Why does your challenge sound so awkward?

148
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:48,650
- It's because we still feel awkward.
- But not for long.

149
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:50,470
- There's some awkwardness.
- Yes, I can see that.

150
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:53,810
- Then Byung Man, you're...
- You. You're mine.

151
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,770
You.
You're mine.

152
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:00,340
It's okay.
It's going to be okay.

153
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:02,410
- It's okay!
- Your pride is on the line!

154
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:05,180
These are the candidates for
the 2014 Olympics!

155
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:08,070
[A skirmish candidate?]

156
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:12,350
- I'm going to bend you in half!
- You don't have to sound so harsh!

157
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:13,800
He knows all the tricks!

158
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:17,000
I hate to bring this up now,
but I had a really tough time last year!

159
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:23,770
[A fiery declaration of war!]

160
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:25,560
This is your pride on the line!

161
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:28,600
But still, it's okay!

162
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,090
- You have to show him.
- Show him what you're made of!

163
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:31,340
- Jae Suk.

[Let's do this!]

165
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:38,310
- Face him with confidence!
- Byung Man's really good at martial arts.

166
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:40,890
- It's okay, you can still do it.
- But having watched Running Man...

167
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:43,360
This isn't about martial arts.
This is all about the use of the brain.

168
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,510
- It's brain and speed.
- No, that's not it.

169
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:46,920
It may look like that, but when
it boils down to it, it's strength.

170
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,770
- Look at him.
- What are you talking about?

171
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:52,000
[Strength is something Mr. Capable
dominates on Running Man?]

172

- You have no idea how much I use my brain!
- Brains or strength?

173
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:56,020
I swear on my life that it's strength.

174
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:03,200
Byung Man, since you've been in the jungle,
you've just aged so much!

175
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,510
- Byung Man!
- Are you about to start crying?

176
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:09,490
[I guess the jungle really is
one tough place...]

177
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:12,240
- You're being too sweet to Byung Man!
- Don't let him shake you up!

178
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:16,010
Apart from the jungle aging you,
it also really slims you down.

179
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:18,920
I really have lost about 8 kilos.

180
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:21,450
- I can see that.
- My poor Byung Man!

181

[Did he fall under Jae Suk's spell?]

182

You can't weaken your resolve
against him!

183
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:30,400
- I totally fell under his spell.
- You can't get sucked in by him.

184
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:34,520
- What are we doing today?
- Here is your mission.

185

taking on today is...</i>

[Running Man vs. Laws of the Jungle]

194
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,920
Wouldn't it just be better to send
Suk Jin to the other team?

195
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,160
Hey!

196
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:18,150
- While we go off playing our games...
- All by himself out of 12 of us...

197
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:20,510
He was the only one who was wondering
about how one gets eliminated.

198
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:24,800
- Suk Jin is curious about elimination.
- When can I start resting then?

[Running Man vs. Laws of the Jungle,

200

- Where do we go? The water park?

[Location for the first competition:
The waterpark.]

202

It's been a while since
we've been to a waterpark.

203
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:40,500
- I guess we're going something in the water.
- We're going to be fighting in the water.

204
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,220
We're strong in the water.

205
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:45,690
- Byung Man and Jin Woon...
- They're really strong.

206
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:48,300
- Byung Man can't be taken lightly.
- He's no joke.

207
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:50,410
- He has a very low center.
- That's what I'm saying.

208
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:52,920
He's the best when it comes to
anything balance related.

209
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,640
Eliminate Jong Kook first, no matter what.
Then we'll win for sure.

210
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:56,790
Okay, I got it.

211
00:10:57,060 --> 00:11:00,910
And if we lose, then we send one of our own
to be taken as their hostage, right?

212
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:03,420
- We have to send one of our own.
- Then let's send Woo Jin.

213
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:06,520
[The first hostage to be sacrificed from
the Jungle Team is Woo Jin?]

214
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:09,070
- If not Woo Jin, I think Jung Chul.
- Jung Chul?

215
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:13,410
But if we think about it,
if Jung Chul is to go over there...

216
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:16,750
I think the other team is going to feel so
awkward that it's going to kill their spirit.

217
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:21,760
- Send me. Send me to them.
- He wants to be sent!

the order of who will become a hostage.]

00:16:55,210 --> 00:16:57,710
- What are you doing?
- You have to put the flippers on first!

321
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,060
[Big-nose certainly is
the black hole for the team.]

322
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,520
What are you doing?

323
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:08,160
[Fails as expected...]

324
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,460
Calm down!

325
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:13,120
- One, two, three, four...
- Come on!

326
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,610
- Seriously!
- that's okay, you can do it!

327
00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:16,640
One, two, three, four...

328
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,640
[Ah, again...]

329
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:31,450
- What the heck is the matter with him?
- Calm down!

330
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,410
Ji Suk Jin!

331
00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:38,300
[It seems as though he might use up
the 199 seconds all on his own.]

332
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:40,640
He's going to use up
199 seconds all by himself!

333
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,830
Get ready!
It'll be our turn soon!

334
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:48,060
Suk Jin will never be able to jump
ten times in a row!

335
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:50,750
Seven, eight, nine, ten!

336
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:53,390
[Ah... he trips on the tenth jump.]

337
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,970
- Nine.
- You only got nine jumps!

338
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:56,580
Let's give up on this round!

339
00:17:56,580 --> 00:18:00,050
- Let's just keep going!
- It's been more than two minutes.

340
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:02,610
What are you doing? Seriously.

341
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:05,140
- It's been more than two minutes!
- What the heck are you doing?

342
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:07,270
[The Chief is getting some rest underwater.]

343
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,460
[Fail- 199 seconds is up.]

344
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:18,520
- 199 seconds is up already.
- He used up the time all by himself.

345
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:22,030
- Why are you so greedy with the time?
- It feels like 199 hours have passed.

346
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:24,050
- I can't do ten.
- You failed.

347
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:26,200
- Gary...
- Gary, you give it a try.

348
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,420
[Switching out with Gary?]

349
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:31,700
- This is hard.
- You try. Getting ten is impossible.

350
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:35,770
This is so annoying!

351
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:39,230
- This is so annoying!
- Isn't it annoying?

352
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:42,040
I feel like I've contracted the rage virus.

353
00:18:42,050 --> 00:18:43,770
What are you going to do?
Not one of you can do it.

354
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:45,990
How is it that none of us
can even do anything?

355
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:50,090
That's good. You do that one.
Don't waste anymore of your energy.

356
00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:52,130
Don't waste your energy.
You can do it.

357
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:55,410
[Mr. Capable- Tackling even
the jump rope with his strength.]

358
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:58,190
That guy seriously...

359
00:18:58,190 --> 00:19:01,950
[Ultimately switching out the first player.]

360
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:05,870
[The Laws of the Jungle Team's attempt.]

361
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:12,370
[R1- Jin Woon. R2- Jung Chul, Woo Jin.
R3- Byung Man, R4- Hye Bin, R5- Ha Ha.]

362
00:19:12,370 --> 00:19:14,050
Let's see how good Jin Woon is!

363
00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:15,980
I'd like to challenge you!

364
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:18,660
- I'd like to challenge you!
- I'd like to challenge you!

365
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,660
[Start]

366
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:24,940
There he goes!

367
00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:29,090
- You dropped one of the balls!
- Okay!

368
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:33,520
He dropped one of the balls.

369
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,660
He took too long to get
the flippers on!

370
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:38,010
- Why are you taking so long with them?
- It's good! Keep it up!

371
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:41,490
- The jump rope is all twisted up!
- They left it in a twisted knot!

372
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:43,010
Someone twisted up the rope!

373
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:49,960
[Darn!]

374
00:19:55,530 --> 00:20:01,210
One, two, three, four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine, ten!

375
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:03,000
[But he succeeds at first attempt.]

376
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:09,680
[Second course-
Taking off the socks underwater.]

377
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,420
Let's keep calm.

378
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:26,510
Are things going well under there?

379
00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:33,280
[Succeeds at taking off the first one!]

380
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:45,330
[Succeeds at taking off the second one!]

381
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:46,500
Did you do it?

382
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:51,490
[Third course- Alkkagi underwater.]

383
00:20:52,610 --> 00:20:53,800
Start!

384
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:01,880
[An expert?
Facing the challenge with an ease.]

385
00:21:06,530 --> 00:21:09,140
[Total concentration with
his eyes wide open.]

386
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:16,120
[Third course- Success!]

387
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:19,120
- He succeeded.
- Okay! Success!

388
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,870
[Must hurry to the fourth course!]

389
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:28,560
[Fourth course-
Catch the balls while hoola hooping.]

390
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,610
- How is she doing that?
- Great job! You caught one!

391
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,160
[Need to catch three to pass.
Succeeds at catching the first one!]

392
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,820
Keep your gaze upward!

393
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:40,090
[Succeeds at catching the second ball!]

394
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:43,890
It's okay.

395
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:45,760
What if we succeed this
on our first try?

396
00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:49,970
[If she catches one more ball,
then they pass the fourth course!]

397
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:51,220
Just one more!

398
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,260
[Success!]

399
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:03,190
[Now to the final fifth course!]

400
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:04,830
Quickly, quickly!

401
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:08,750
[Fifth course-
Ride the slide down and score the ball.]

402
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,360
Nice, nice, nice!

403
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:19,800
[There's not much time left!]

404
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:31,000
[Fearful Ro-Ro gets on the slide.]

405
00:22:42,450 --> 00:22:44,580
Why isn't he coming out?
Did he get caught along the way?

406
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,450
Did he get caught along the way?

407
00:22:50,450 --> 00:22:51,840
There he is!

408
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:58,890
[And down he comes!]

409
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:07,170
The balls!
Where is the basket?

410
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:16,280
[He just need to take the basket and
make a goal with one of the balls!]

411
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:21,110
[Darn!
He lost three of the balls!]

412
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:29,510
[Will he make it?]

413
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:36,180
[If he can just score one,
then they pass all the courses.]

414
00:23:45,870 --> 00:23:47,370
[Goal in!]

415
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:50,300
[Succeeds at passing the five courses!]

416
00:23:55,540 --> 00:24:01,100
[199 seconds mission...
what is their record?]

417
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:02,890
<i>Your time is 240 seconds.</i>

418
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:05,780
[Ah... 240 seconds!]

419
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:11,170
Can you give us more time?

420
00:24:11,170 --> 00:24:13,290
We were great considering
that it was our first attempt.

421
00:24:13,290 --> 00:24:14,600
Hye Bin, you did great.

422
00:24:17,210 --> 00:24:19,760
- Let's do this!
- I'll get it done in one try, okay?

423
00:24:20,910 --> 00:24:23,180
- I think he's cleaning up the area.
- I'll get it done in first attempt.

424
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:26,620
We've got ourselves an
Olympic athlete here.

425
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:30,930
[R1- Jong Kook. R2- Suk Jin, Jae Suk.
R3- Ji Hyo. R4- Kwang Soo. R5- Gary.]

426
00:24:30,930 --> 00:24:32,050
Fighting!

427
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:40,270
- There you go!
- That's good!

428
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:43,400
[Mr. Capable's quick speed!]

429
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,050
- Let's do this!
- You need to get ten!

430
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:49,730
One, two, three...

431
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:52,400
You have to succeed at first attempt!
You're going to lose your energy.

432
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:54,320
Slow down, slow down.

433
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:59,290
One, two, three, four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine...

434
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,740
[Ah... on the ninth one!]

435
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,410
This is how it depletes your energy.

436
00:25:05,410 --> 00:25:09,140
Five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten!

437
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:10,950
[Finally!]

438
00:25:11,850 --> 00:25:12,910
Quickly!

439
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:15,820
[Why is he ringing the gong again?]

440
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:17,510
- Quickly!
- Why do that again? We don't have time!

441
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:19,860
[Off to the second course-
Take off the socks underwater.]

442
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:25,010
[Big-nose Brother is the black hole
with everything that he does.]

443
00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:27,180
What's taking you so long to get there?

444
00:25:33,090 --> 00:25:34,800
Why are you so heavy?

445
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,420
[Oh no, the balls...]

446
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:44,250
Come on, that's just too much!

447
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:49,730
[Oh my... all the balls!]

448
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:53,970
We don't have any balls left!

449
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,650
Why couldn't you do that?

450
00:25:57,650 --> 00:25:59,920
[Fails from having lost all their balls.]

451
00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:01,760
He's way too heavy.

452
00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:03,280
I think Ji Hyo needs to do this one.

453
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:07,220
- Everyone...
- Yes?

454
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:09,450
If both teams agree,
I'll lessen the first course to five jumps.

455
00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:11,120
- No, we refuse.
- No! Let's just do ten.

456
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,090
Why are you refusing it when
everyone else is okay with it?

457
00:26:13,090 --> 00:26:14,690
It gives us a better advantage!

458
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:17,160
We can't give them any leverage!

459
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:21,650
- Five. Let's just do five. Those that agree?
- By show of hands. One, two, three!

460
00:26:21,650 --> 00:26:22,720
[Ultimately deciding on five...]

461
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:25,210
[Agrees on five jumps.]

462
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:27,280
- In that case, let's just settle on five.
- Yes.

463
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:30,000
- I'll do it then.
- Okay, let's just let him do it.

464
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,510
- Okay, we're good.
- Running Man Team, get ready.

465
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:34,300
[R1- Suk Jin. R2- Ji Hyo, Jong Kook.
R3- Gary, R4- Kwang Soo, R5- Jae Suk.]

466
00:26:39,770 --> 00:26:42,270
- Fighting!
- Fighting. Stay calm!

467
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:43,840
Think of this as your last chance!

468
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,430
Fighting!

469
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:54,150
[Wow!
Succeeds at his first attempt!]

470
00:26:54,150 --> 00:26:55,830
- You succeeded!
- Run!

471
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:58,910
[Off to the second course-
Taking off the socks underwater.]

472
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:01,030
- Here!
- Quickly!

473
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,530
[Strong Kkuk lies in wait.]

474
00:27:04,530 --> 00:27:06,790
Show them what you can do
instead of just chattering away!

475
00:27:07,570 --> 00:27:09,960
- That's a very good point.
- That's what you need to do!

476
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:13,950
- That's what you need to do!
- Concentrate on taking off the socks.

477
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,470
- You're almost there!
- He's almost got it off.

478
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:31,140
[Success!]

479
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:35,160
[Third course- Gary]

480
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,140
Go!

481
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:46,630
[Even though Chief Byung Man,
who's an expert made it look easy...]

482
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:52,580
[Keeping control isn't easy
due to the buoyancy.]

483
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:01,930
It's okay!

484
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:09,220
[A relaxed spectator.]

485
00:28:16,410 --> 00:28:18,290
[Finally succeeds!]

486
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:23,510
[Must hurry to the fourth course!]

487
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:26,280
We may be able to pull this off!

488
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:29,350
- Kwang Soo!
- Set it down over there.

489
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:30,680
[Kwang Soo's in charge of
the hoola hoop.]

490
00:28:34,690 --> 00:28:36,060
Look up!

491
00:28:40,090 --> 00:28:41,510
It really hurts!

492
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:46,090
Listen to that sound.
Just listen to that sound.

493
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,120
- Just endure it!
- It hit him in the pit of his stomach.

494
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,430
- Just endure it!
- Hurry it up!

495
00:28:55,430 --> 00:28:58,160
[The clock is ticking.]

496
00:28:59,610 --> 00:29:01,640
- There you go! Now, look up!
- You're doing good!

497
00:29:01,650 --> 00:29:03,520
- Nice!
- Just look up!

498
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,020
[He caught it!]

499
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,490
[A guy must catch five.]

500
00:29:13,050 --> 00:29:14,700
- Three!
- Look up!

501
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:20,120
- This is your last one!
- Keep it going!

502
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:21,810
[Just one more!]

503
00:29:21,810 --> 00:29:24,500
- You have to keep it going!
- Just keep it going!

504
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,470
[Success!]

505
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:39,640
[Now to the final fifth course!]

506
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:45,500
Hurry up!

507
00:29:46,670 --> 00:29:48,080
I don't think I can do this.

508
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:53,460
[Not much time left on the clock!]

509
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:59,580
[Must get down the slide quickly
and score their goal.]

510
00:30:25,710 --> 00:30:28,570
[Needs to be careful to
protect the balls in the basket...]

511
00:30:39,150 --> 00:30:42,330
[Oh no!]

512
00:30:43,930 --> 00:30:46,490
[But as long as he scores one ball!]

513
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:56,630
[Please...]

514
00:31:03,950 --> 00:31:08,080
[The last ball.]

515
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:12,470
[Ah...]

516
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:14,290
[Fail]

517
00:31:17,290 --> 00:31:19,820
- You should've thrown it better!
- You're totally a younger Suk Jin.

518
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:21,230
What are you doing?

519
00:31:21,230 --> 00:31:24,410
Your record was 211 seconds.

520
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,040
Jong Kook!

521
00:31:29,610 --> 00:31:31,920
- Can you do the hoola hoop?
- Do better next time around.

522
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:34,570
[No one is interested
in doing the hoola hoop.]

523
00:31:34,570 --> 00:31:36,440
- Let's switch!
- No, you do it.

524
00:31:37,210 --> 00:31:40,110
[Back to the Jungle Team's turn.]

525
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:43,380
- Fighting!
- Let's do this!

526
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:47,430
Jung Chul!
Let's do the battle call!

527
00:31:47,430 --> 00:31:50,450
- The laws of the jungle!
- Fighting!

528
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:55,640
[R1- Jung Chul. R2- Woo Jin, Jin Woon.
R3- Byung Man. R4- Hye Bin. R5- Ha Ha.]

529
00:31:58,030 --> 00:32:00,600
- Fighting!
- Jung Chul, fighting!

530
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:05,090
- Let's stay calm.
- Even Suk Jin did it earlier.

531
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:12,820
[Will he succeed at his first attempt?]

532
00:32:17,010 --> 00:32:18,680
[Pass!]

533
00:32:22,610 --> 00:32:24,370
[Here I come!]

534
00:32:25,890 --> 00:32:28,100
[Second course-
Take off the socks underwater.]

535
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:33,220
Show them what you can do, Jin Woon!

536
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:37,900
Jin Woon, take off the socks!

537
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:40,170
Kim Jong Kook used his strength earlier.

538
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:41,790
Stay calm.
Stay calm.

539
00:32:41,790 --> 00:32:43,980
Watch how Jin Woon does this
and learn from him!

540
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,290
[Succeeds at taking off his first one!]

541
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:52,510
Stay calm and take your time!

542
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:58,290
[Succeeds at taking off
his second one right away!]

543
00:33:00,170 --> 00:33:01,690
Nice!

544
00:33:06,690 --> 00:33:09,440
[Already heading off to the third course!
Underwater alkkagi.]

545
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:18,350
[Underwater submersion expert,
Kim Byung Man.]

546
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:24,820
<i>Go, go, go, go, go!</i>

547
00:33:25,410 --> 00:33:27,920
[It seems as though he may even be
able to stay down there to play badook.]

548
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,180
He's taking longer this time around.

549
00:33:34,150 --> 00:33:35,930
How can Byung Man not even breathe?

550
00:33:37,370 --> 00:33:38,980
[Calm]

551
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:44,000
Check and see if Byung Man is breathing!

552
00:33:45,450 --> 00:33:47,550
[Success!]

553
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:50,870
Byung Man has gills.

554
00:33:54,590 --> 00:33:57,090
[Off to the fourth course.
To the sole female on their team, Hye Bin.]

555
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,240
[Ah... didn't catch the first ball.]

556
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:08,220
Take it easy.
Take it easy and catch the ball.

557
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:10,730
There you go!

558
00:34:18,770 --> 00:34:20,070
[Succeeds at catching the second one!]

559
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:23,940
[Just one last ball.]

560
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,340
[Pass!]

561
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:32,410
[Now off to the final fifth course!]

562
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:39,910
[Chief Byung Man running along together!]

563
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:50,660
Run!

564
00:34:51,110 --> 00:34:52,570
Quickly!
Run faster!

565
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:04,520
[Finally arrives to the summit with
Chief Byung Man at his heels.]

566
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:05,600
But why is he running with him?

567
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:09,620
[Last course- the slide.]

568
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:17,880
[Please!]

569
00:35:31,470 --> 00:35:33,440
[Chief Byung Man goes down
the slide too!]

570
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,710
[Now if he can only make a goal!]

571
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:42,090
Dong Hoon is really good
at making shots.

572
00:35:43,570 --> 00:35:45,410
[Amazing!
The time isn't up yet!]

573
00:35:45,410 --> 00:35:47,600
He's going to score right away.

574
00:35:51,050 --> 00:35:52,340
[The ball unfortunately
hits the side and misses!]

575
00:35:54,750 --> 00:35:58,970
[Will he make it this time?]

576
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:07,330
[Goal in!]

577
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:10,020
[Passes all five courses!]

578
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:17,810
[How can this be...]

579
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:19,480
We did it!
We did it!

580
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:28,080
[What is the record?]

581
00:36:28,090 --> 00:36:30,320
[193 seconds- Success!]

582
00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:39,290
One, two, three, four.
The Jung, the Jung, the laws of the jungle!

583
00:36:40,770 --> 00:36:44,140
[The Laws of the Jungle Team wins!]

584
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:49,620
The first victory goes to
the Laws of the Jungle Team!

585
00:36:50,970 --> 00:36:58,580
Running Man Team now has to choose a hostage
who won't be able to participate in the final.

586
00:36:58,580 --> 00:37:00,930
Please choose your man.

587
00:37:08,450 --> 00:37:10,920
[Big-nose Brother left behind
on his own.]

588
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:13,370
Okay, please shout out the name of your
chosen hostage on three.

589
00:37:13,370 --> 00:37:16,240
- One, two, three.
- Ji Suk Jin.

590
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:23,650
- He's your chosen one?
- We already discussed this.

591
00:37:23,650 --> 00:37:26,520
- But you can keep playing the games for now.
- When did we discuss this?

592
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:28,700
- When did you discuss this?
- It wasn't a long discussion.

593
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:30,720
We've already decided last year.

594
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,560
We know since we've been doing this
for three years already.

595
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:36,910
[Heading off immediately
to the next location!]

596
00:37:38,490 --> 00:37:41,590
- I can't believe we lost.
- Yeah, we won!

597
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:44,170
What was it that you said?
That Running Man Team can't be beaten?

598
00:37:44,170 --> 00:37:45,210
What did you say?

599
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:54,600
[A giant horizontal bar in the water?]

600
00:37:55,170 --> 00:37:57,420
As you can see behind you,
your next mission is...

601
00:37:57,420 --> 00:37:59,450
the group horizontal bar competition

602
00:37:59,450 --> 00:38:00,970
Group horizontal bar competition?

603
00:38:00,970 --> 00:38:03,080
[Second mission-
Group horizontal bar competition.]

604
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:06,780
[All the members participate in the fight,
and the team with last member standing wins.]

605
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:09,840
- But Byung Man's really good at hanging.
- Byung Man, he's really good at hanging on.

606
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,900
- Wow, this really is...
- This game is for Byung Man's benefit.

607
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:14,980
There aren't many of us who can
even cross the horizontal bar.

608
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:18,030
- Crossing this is a mission for us.
- Why is he looking at me?

609
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:20,890
- How many certifications do you have?
- He's amazing at sports.

610
00:38:20,890 --> 00:38:22,630
I have eight certification
just in water sports alone.

611
00:38:22,630 --> 00:38:24,720
[Seriously? Eight certificates
just in water sports alone?]

612
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:27,280
And did you know that Hye Bin used to
do rhythmic gymnastics?

613
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,320
- Really?
- When I was younger.

614
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,600
They have the total advantage.

615
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:33,380
This team isn't one for us to
go up against right now!

616
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:37,790
But does Jung Chul always have
that sad expression on his face?

617
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:41,710
I actually have a very happy
expression on my face right now.

618
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:43,130
What's your nickname, Jung Chul?

619
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:46,120
- Your nickname when you were younger.
- During my school years?

620
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:48,260
When I used to be in school,
I was nicknamed, 'Fly-paper'.

621
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:49,360
Why were you called that?

622
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:53,050
Because when I used to get in fights,
I stuck myself to a person and didn't let go.

623
00:38:53,050 --> 00:38:55,460
Then he would be perfect for this mission.

624
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:57,630
[Then does this mean that this mission
would be perfect for him?]

625
00:38:57,630 --> 00:39:01,130
Then let's see what Fly-paper can do first.

626
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:02,950
[Filled with expectations to see
what Fly-paper can do.]

627
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:07,230
[Best out of three-
Aquatic horizontal bar competition.]

628
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:10,440
Wow... this isn't going to be easy.

629
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:12,730
I already can't even reach.

630
00:39:14,610 --> 00:39:18,020
[Neither of the teams' floats offer
them any room to move around.]

631
00:39:27,450 --> 00:39:29,940
[Uh... he's short.]

632
00:39:34,550 --> 00:39:36,600
- We have to win this time.
- Of course we have to win.

633
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:38,590
- Fighting.
- Fighting!

634
00:39:38,590 --> 00:39:41,880
The Jung, the Jung,
the laws of the jungle!

635
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:47,590
[First round- Start!]

636
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:50,310
Let's go!

637
00:39:50,310 --> 00:39:52,080
We can't be hasty about our attack.

638
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:54,240
He's going up.
Byung Man is going up to the top.

639
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:56,110
[Oh my... climbing up top right away?]

640
00:39:58,130 --> 00:40:02,690
[Expert at air walking.
Kim Byung Man walking with a fast pace.]

641
00:40:02,690 --> 00:40:07,370
[Walking on top of the metal bars
as if he's walking down the street.]

642
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:14,070
[Within moments, he arrives on
top of the Running Man Team.]

643
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:21,240
[Fly-paper Jung Chul continuing the drive
and getting on his way!]

644
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:25,040
Stick yourself right there.

645
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:27,670
I'm coming.
I'm sticking myself to the spot.

646
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:31,660
[What!
Even Hye Bin?]

647
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,970
[We're from the jungle!]

648
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:42,500
[Tree climbing is a part of our
everyday lives.]

649
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:47,250
[These members have conquered
the wilds of the jungle.]

650
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:50,780
[You can call us, Spiderman.]

651
00:40:57,050 --> 00:40:58,340
- What was that?
- Who was that?

652
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:01,170
[What the heck?]

653
00:41:02,450 --> 00:41:05,570
[The expert of the jungle
falling off his tree.]

654
00:41:08,250 --> 00:41:10,160
[Woo Jin terminates himself.]

655
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:14,410
[Not every member of the
Jungle Team can be good.]

656

lounging around in his living room.]

00:41:25,210 --> 00:41:27,830
[Even Jin Woon is
getting in his attack mode.]

659
00:41:27,830 --> 00:41:29,600
They're all up there now.

660
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:41,600
They're like zombies!

661
00:41:41,850 --> 00:41:45,150
[Crowing in on Running Man members.]

662
00:41:50,870 --> 00:41:54,960

Jin Woon first!]

00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:00,670
[Huh?]

664
00:42:00,670 --> 00:42:04,650
[A forceful attack?]

[Ro-Ro finally sets off to help Jin Woon!]

668

by their concentrated attack.]

669
00:42:37,670 --> 00:42:39,910
[Short Ro-Ro takes care of
eliminating himself on his own.]

670
00:42:42,390 --> 00:42:45,510
[Jin Woon doesn't go down alone!
He ousts Yoo Hyuk along with him!]

671
00:42:47,730 --> 00:42:49,440
Someone lost their pants!

672
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:51,660
Someone's pants are floating over there.

673
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:01,890

without any hesitation.]

[Gary - Out!]

[Laws of the Jungle Team's blind attack!]

678
00:43:25,990 --> 00:43:30,970
[Claiming their spot on the horizontal bar.]

679
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:33,040
Nice!
Nice!

680
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:35,790
[Just then, even Hye Jin
steps up her force of attack!]

681
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:42,080

in the midst of utter chaos.]

even the impossible become possible.]

[This man was still alive?]

696
00:45:00,550 --> 00:45:02,680

[And black hole Big-nosed Brother is...]

700
00:45:22,230 --> 00:45:23,420
I'm sorry!

701
00:45:24,060 --> 00:45:26,030

718
00:46:35,220 --> 00:46:37,920
I really thought that I had some
sticky paper stuck all over me.

719
00:46:39,290 --> 00:46:41,480
Hye Bin is no joke either.

720
00:46:42,260 --> 00:46:45,040
[Her blind attacks befitting of
a female warrior of the jungle.]

721
00:46:49,710 --> 00:46:51,000
Why don't we start this out with
a one on one face-off?

722
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,400
[One on one face-off first?]

723
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:54,950
Kim Byung Man is going to be
our first fighter.

724
00:46:54,950 --> 00:46:56,520
Why me?

725
00:46:57,470 --> 00:46:59,840
You can do this, Kwang Soo.
He's not in the jungle anymore.

726
00:46:59,850 --> 00:47:01,520
Kwang Soo, go.

727
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:03,690

with the expert of the wild...]

a matter of moments.]

735

it turns into a group face-off.]

736
00:48:06,750 --> 00:48:09,190
[Kwang Soo and Ro-Ro are out!]

737

[Byung Man and Jin Woon
jointly attack Yoo Hyuk.]

738
00:48:16,290 --> 00:48:17,460

00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:19,930
[Hm...]

740
00:48:19,930 --> 00:48:21,940
[Bowl cut style Yoo Hyuk.]

741
00:48:27,270 --> 00:48:29,980
[Remaining survivors-
Running Man 4 vs. Laws of the Jungle 5.]

742
00:48:29,980 --> 00:48:31,970
You have to help him!
Jong Kook is going to get him otherwise!

743
00:48:32,550 --> 00:48:34,090
Jin Woon!
You have to get Jong Kook!

744
00:48:34,090 --> 00:48:37,180
[Expert vs. Mr. Capable]

745
00:48:38,220 --> 00:48:42,670
[A real battle between the
two strongest warriors.]

746
00:48:52,050 --> 00:48:53,730
[Hm...]

747
00:48:57,190 --> 00:48:59,750
[So cozy...]

748
00:49:00,970 --> 00:49:02,590
Gary, you have to get
Byung Man off of him!

749
00:49:03,310 --> 00:49:04,740
[Ultimately falls in the water!]

750
00:49:05,750 --> 00:49:09,030
[Byung Man and Kkuk are ultimately
ousted simultaneously.]

751
00:49:12,510 --> 00:49:15,000
[Running Man's Suk Jin and Ji Hyo
vs. Laws of the Jungle's Jin Woon.]

752
00:49:17,740 --> 00:49:19,850
[Big-nosed Brother is in danger!]

753
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:27,010
[And is ousted without a fuss.]

754
00:49:32,420 --> 00:49:35,410
[Running Man's Ji Hyo vs.
Law of the Jungle's Jin Woon.]

755
00:49:36,610 --> 00:49:38,270
We can't let this go to
the third round!

756
00:49:39,170 --> 00:49:41,100
- But how am I supposed to...
- Just do it!

757
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:43,800
- Hug her and dunk her!
- Hug her and let her fall softly.

758
00:49:47,180 --> 00:49:49,260
[Huh?]

759
00:49:51,410 --> 00:49:53,270
What are you two doing right now?

760
00:49:53,270 --> 00:49:54,820
You're supposed to be
playing the game!

761
00:49:54,820 --> 00:49:56,100
What are you two doing right now?

762
00:49:56,100 --> 00:49:58,760
[Blank Ji desperately
clinging on to Jin Woon.]

763
00:50:01,180 --> 00:50:02,430
[Ji Hyo in danger!]

764
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:04,250
You're doing good!

765
00:50:04,860 --> 00:50:07,120
[Gently...]

766
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:09,050
[We won!]

767
00:50:09,050 --> 00:50:11,910
[Laws of the Jungle wins!]

768
00:50:14,710 --> 00:50:16,920
[Running Man Team has to pick
another hostage from their team.]

769
00:50:16,930 --> 00:50:18,240
I'll do it.

770
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:19,750
You can oust me.

771
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:22,910
- Just oust me.
- You guys are making me tear up.

772
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:24,820
For the sake of our team...

773
00:50:24,820 --> 00:50:27,220
- I'll eliminate myself.
- No, I'll eliminate myself!

774
00:50:27,220 --> 00:50:29,160
No, I'll eliminate myself!
Just eliminate all of us together!

775
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:32,130
- In that case...
- No, I'll sacrifice myself!

776
00:50:32,850 --> 00:50:34,450
It's me.
Let's just do it that way.

777
00:50:34,450 --> 00:50:36,830
- One, two, three.
- Yoo Jae Suk!

778
00:50:36,830 --> 00:50:39,900
[Yoo Hyuk as hostage- Agreed.]

779
00:50:48,660 --> 00:50:49,900
What is this?

780
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:53,130
It looks like it's set up for a sled.

781
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:54,690
Do we just sit here?

782
00:50:55,220 --> 00:50:58,330
[Sit on top of the special stage that's
been set up on top of an ice rink.]

783
00:50:58,330 --> 00:50:59,920
I wonder what we're
going to do here?

784
00:51:00,070 --> 00:51:02,700
Running Man vs. Laws of the Jungle.
Survivor Race.

785
00:51:02,700 --> 00:51:04,300
Wait!
Our team is going to read it.

786
00:51:07,850 --> 00:51:09,780
Just because you guys won the
last two missions...

787
00:51:10,410 --> 00:51:12,720
You're crowding me, so just sit down.

788
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:17,320
- Why aren't our two slaves coming over here?
- We're not slaves, we're hostages.

789
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:21,060
Why are you calling us slaves?
We're not your slaves.

790
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:24,060
Please read it for us.

791
00:51:24,070 --> 00:51:27,560
Running Man vs. Laws of the Jungle.
Survivor Race.

792
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:32,390
Find the real expert!

793
00:51:34,980 --> 00:51:37,240
You're really feeling feisty now.

794
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:39,260
Find the expert!

795
00:51:40,350 --> 00:51:42,970
[Fly-paper's mood has improved
considerably after ousting Mr. Capable.]

796
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:47,730
<i>Everyone will act as if you're an expert.
But there's only one real expert.</i>

797
00:51:47,730 --> 00:51:53,910
<i>The person who's going to act it out has
to act well as to not get caught.</i>

798
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:55,790
- We're all set then!
- And that's how you win.

799
00:51:55,790 --> 00:52:03,500
[Must find not real expert,
and not the poser in order to win!]

800
00:52:04,260 --> 00:52:05,810
- What is that?
- It's a sled.

801
00:52:06,460 --> 00:52:08,880
<i>The reason why we're doing it here is
because of that sled.</i>

802
00:52:08,890 --> 00:52:11,970
[The mission is being carried out in this
cold ice rink because of the sled being used.]

803
00:52:12,150 --> 00:52:14,950
This is the first category that
Running Man Team will be doing.

804
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:17,190
What is 'Expert actress'?

805
00:52:17,190 --> 00:52:19,780
[Expert Actress]

806
00:52:19,790 --> 00:52:21,220
Expert actress?

807
00:52:21,740 --> 00:52:26,660
All six of you will be calling someone.

808
00:52:26,660 --> 00:52:30,880
But there will only be one person who
will be talking to a real actress.

809
00:52:31,490 --> 00:52:34,940
And the rest of you will be pretending
to be talking to someone on the phone.

810
00:52:34,940 --> 00:52:37,230
- That sounds easy.
- I think that'll be easy.

811
00:52:37,230 --> 00:52:39,900
I'm really obvious with things like that.
I don't know what to do.

812
00:52:40,570 --> 00:52:43,280
- We're all good at things like this.
- We're all good actors.

813
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:49,370
We may not know who it's going to be,
but one of us will be talking to an actress?

814
00:52:49,370 --> 00:52:51,350
- A real actress?
- We're calling a real actress?

815
00:52:51,350 --> 00:52:52,610
- Is it a real actress?
- It's an actress?

816
00:52:52,610 --> 00:52:54,030
Who... who are we calling?

817
00:52:56,220 --> 00:52:59,450
Ji Hyo's a good actress,
and Suk Jin's really bad.

818
00:52:59,450 --> 00:53:01,660
[Having turned around while RM Team
decides who'll be making the real call.]

819
00:53:02,380 --> 00:53:05,160
- We're really going to be talking to this person?
- Wait a second.

820
00:53:07,130 --> 00:53:09,740
- I can't believe that we'll be talking to her!
- Isn't she really busy?

821
00:53:09,740 --> 00:53:10,850
I know her very well.

822
00:53:11,350 --> 00:53:15,750
[Just which one of these members will
really be talking to the actress?]

823
00:53:17,050 --> 00:53:19,260
- Hello?
- Hello!

824
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:21,940
- Hello?
- Hello!

825
00:53:23,930 --> 00:53:25,500
- Hello?
- Hello?

826
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:30,740
[It seems like
everyone's talking to someone...]

827
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:32,990
It's not Gary!

828
00:53:36,590 --> 00:53:40,120
[One of them is really talking
to a real actress.]

829
00:53:48,610 --> 00:53:50,310
Suk Jin, just hang up the phone.

830
00:53:53,670 --> 00:53:55,950
- How about one at a time?
- Can you take turns talking one at a time?

831
00:53:57,210 --> 00:53:58,570
Have you been well?

832
00:53:58,570 --> 00:54:00,030
- Pass!
- Why?

833
00:54:02,300 --> 00:54:05,080
- You're not it!
- Let me talk on the phone!

834
00:54:07,810 --> 00:54:09,970
You look awkward even to me.

835
00:54:09,970 --> 00:54:11,470
[And Ji Hyo?]

836
00:54:11,950 --> 00:54:14,750
Yes, we just need to talk
for a little while.

837
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:18,440
If you can talk to me for about a minute,
I would really appreciate it.

838
00:54:19,810 --> 00:54:23,050
[Is he talking to someone for real?
Yoo Hyuk has a big smile on his face.]

839
00:54:24,170 --> 00:54:26,270
[And Big-nosed Brother?]

840
00:54:26,270 --> 00:54:27,960
- Pass!
- He says pass!

841
00:54:31,370 --> 00:54:34,030
- Kwang Soo.
- She says she's filming right now.

842
00:54:34,580 --> 00:54:37,140
- Just hang up if you have nothing to say.
- Of course, we're filming right now.

843
00:54:37,410 --> 00:54:39,320
I didn't mean us.

844
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:41,550
- Seriously?
- I'm serious! Serious!

845
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:46,080
Didn't you tell me that he
can't act earlier?

846
00:54:47,300 --> 00:54:50,470
[Mr. Capable talking with his face
hidden behind is hand.]

847
00:54:50,970 --> 00:54:54,120
People usually hide their face
when they're not feeling confident.

848
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:55,480
Okay, Jae Suk.

849
00:54:55,480 --> 00:54:57,650
[Smiley face Jae Suk's turn.]

850
00:54:57,650 --> 00:55:04,140
I really want to react to this call right now
but if I do, the other team...

851
00:55:04,140 --> 00:55:05,850
Suk Jin, just hang up!
I told you, we're all set with you!

852
00:55:05,850 --> 00:55:08,770
- Gary, you can hang up too!
- I'm talking on the phone right now!

853
00:55:08,780 --> 00:55:10,350
Why do I have to hang up?

854
00:55:12,210 --> 00:55:13,310
What's wrong with everyone?

855
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:14,940
Can you all just keep it down?

856
00:55:17,030 --> 00:55:19,830
- Do you even know who this is?
- Do you have any idea who this is?

857
00:55:20,420 --> 00:55:23,020
- You have no idea who I'm talking to!
- Do you even know who it is?

858
00:55:23,020 --> 00:55:25,500
I'm going to hang up now.
Bye!

859
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:27,990
Who were you talking to?
Just tell us who you were talking to.

860
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,540
- Can we tell them?
- Can we reveal who it was?

861
00:55:29,540 --> 00:55:30,890
- Can we tell them?
- Everyone at the same time.

862
00:55:30,890 --> 00:55:32,360
One, two, three!

863
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:33,860
- Son Ye Jin!
- Angelina Jolie.

864
00:55:33,860 --> 00:55:36,340
- Son Ye Jin!
- Did you say Son Ye Jin?

865
00:55:36,340 --> 00:55:38,870
- Son Ye Jin?
- I was talking to Son Ye Jin too.

866
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:42,780
- No, you weren't. Tell us the truth.
- I really was talking to Son Ye Jin!

867
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:45,640
- He said he was talking to Angelina Jolie.
- Angelina Jolie?

868
00:55:47,430 --> 00:55:50,740
I'm her Korean language teacher.

869
00:55:51,570 --> 00:55:53,110
Jolie?
I'm Galie.

870
00:55:54,030 --> 00:55:55,960
What's her favorite food?

871
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:58,810
You food... what like?

872
00:55:59,710 --> 00:56:01,690
Okay. Chapagheri?
(Chapaghetti- Popular ramen)

873
00:56:01,690 --> 00:56:03,460
Chapagheri?

874
00:56:03,950 --> 00:56:05,870
- Chapagheri?
- I wonder if it's Gary?

875
00:56:05,870 --> 00:56:07,230
Galie... that's funny.

876
00:56:07,720 --> 00:56:12,070
I think Suk Jin down to the right are fake.
And the other three are possible real ones.

877
00:56:12,070 --> 00:56:15,430
The feeling I got is that it's one
of the three up front.

878
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:17,470
- Kwang Soo?
- I don't think it's Jong Kook.

879
00:56:17,470 --> 00:56:18,810
I don't think it's Jong Kook either.

880
00:56:19,220 --> 00:56:23,370
Kwang Soo, why don't you ask the person
on the other line a question?

881
00:56:23,370 --> 00:56:25,320
Ask her who her favorite member
is on Running Man.

882
00:56:26,100 --> 00:56:28,850
Who's your favorite member
on Running Man?

883
00:56:31,230 --> 00:56:34,000
- Yes!
- We're set. It's not him.

884
00:56:34,930 --> 00:56:37,930
[Kwang Soo disqualified?]

885
00:56:37,930 --> 00:56:42,670
[There's no way an actress would say
that Kwang Soo is her favorite?]

886
00:56:42,670 --> 00:56:45,030
- He almost had me.
- Seriously...

887
00:56:45,030 --> 00:56:47,280
- Who next?
- How about Jong Kook?

888
00:56:48,310 --> 00:56:51,220
- Ask Song Ye Jin what her birthday is?
- Her birthdate?

889
00:56:52,190 --> 00:56:53,400
Hello?

890
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:55,400
Look at how awkward he's acting.
It's definitely not him.

891
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:58,380
- It's not him.
- Ye Jin, what is your birthdate?

892
00:56:58,380 --> 00:57:00,840
- Don't stutter. Don't stutter.
- When is your birthday?

893
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:04,560
April... 28th?
Okay, I got it.

894
00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:08,280
Jae Suk, this time, you ask
Son Ye Jin when her birthday is.

895
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:11,330
[Jae Suk has to ask her the same
question this time?]

896
00:57:11,330 --> 00:57:13,750
To be honest,
I'm not that close to Ye Jin.

897
00:57:13,750 --> 00:57:15,170
- That's okay.
- It's okay?

898
00:57:15,820 --> 00:57:18,380
Listen, Ye Jin... they want me
to ask you for your birthday.

899
00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:21,520
July...

900
00:57:22,270 --> 00:57:24,810
- What year was she born?
- July 26th.

901
00:57:24,820 --> 00:57:26,490
- July 26th?
- July 26th.

902
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:30,180
Okay, no more questions.
You've got ten seconds to give your answer.

903
00:57:30,180 --> 00:57:32,820
[Must choose the one person who was talking
to the actress within 10 seconds?]

904
00:57:34,260 --> 00:57:38,130
Okay, it's not Gary, not sure about Ji Hyo,
and it's not Suk Jin either.

905
00:57:38,130 --> 00:57:40,320
I think it could be Kwang Soo.
What if it's really Kwang Soo?

906
00:57:40,330 --> 00:57:42,620
Why do you all think that
it's not me?

907
00:57:44,460 --> 00:57:46,490
- Why do you keep thinking it's not me?
- Could it be Gary?

908
00:57:46,490 --> 00:57:49,350
Our show is on a level where it's possible
to get Angelina on the line now.

909
00:57:49,350 --> 00:57:53,050
- Of course, she can!
- Even Jackie Chan's been on our show.

910
00:57:53,510 --> 00:57:54,780
You think it's Kwang Soo?

911
00:57:55,670 --> 00:57:57,930
- I think it's Jae Suk.
- I think it's Jae Suk too.

912
00:57:57,930 --> 00:57:59,800
But I think it could be Jong Kook too.

913
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:01,100
[Could it really be Jae Suk?]

914
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:03,940
- It's now time to give your answer.
- I thought it was Jae Suk at first.

915
00:58:03,940 --> 00:58:06,780
- But I think he's lying.
- What about Song Ji Hyo?

916
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:09,350
[Ji Hyo's silence is making her
even more suspicious.]

917
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:14,400
[Which one of them was really
talking to the actress?]

918
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:17,090
- I really think it's Jae Suk though.
- Okay, let's just go with him.

919
00:58:17,090 --> 00:58:19,050
- Okay.
- One, two, three!

920
00:58:19,050 --> 00:58:21,170
<i>Yoo Jae Suk!</i>

921
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:24,370
Okay, the other person
is still on the line, right?

922
00:58:24,370 --> 00:58:27,620
We're going to start with Gary
and see who the person was.

923
00:58:28,650 --> 00:58:31,090
But if it really is Angelina Jolie,
wouldn't it be just unbelievable?

924
00:58:31,940 --> 00:58:34,210
- That would be just amazing.
- Angelina Jolie...

925
00:58:34,210 --> 00:58:37,030
Then Kang Gary,
please say 'hello' to the other person.

926
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:39,750
- One, two, three.
- Hello, Jolie?

927
00:58:40,490 --> 00:58:42,010
Hello?

928
00:58:42,010 --> 00:58:43,260
Hello!

929
00:58:43,950 --> 00:58:45,250
Hey, talk to me!

930
00:58:45,250 --> 00:58:46,390
Hello?

931
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:50,010
[Gary was a lie.]

932
00:58:51,890 --> 00:58:55,180
[Then could it be Ji Hyo?]

933
00:58:56,270 --> 00:58:57,690
Hello?

934
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:00,450
You can say something.

935
00:59:01,350 --> 00:59:03,030
- Hello?
- It's not her!

936
00:59:03,030 --> 00:59:06,460
[Ji Hyo also was a lie.]

937
00:59:06,940 --> 00:59:08,310
[Time to check Suk Jin.]

938
00:59:08,310 --> 00:59:10,410
We can just skip over Suk Jin.

939
00:59:11,810 --> 00:59:13,490
- You don't have to check?
- No, we don't.

940
00:59:13,490 --> 00:59:15,390
Hello?
Ye Jin?

941
00:59:15,390 --> 00:59:18,270
[Talking into a dead phone.]

942
00:59:19,270 --> 00:59:21,750
[Time to check Kwang Soo.]

943
00:59:22,830 --> 00:59:24,360
My turn?

944
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:26,220
- If it really is Kwang Soo...
- Ye Jin?

945
00:59:28,070 --> 00:59:29,430
Hello?

946
00:59:29,430 --> 00:59:30,690
<i>Hello?</i>

947
00:59:32,340 --> 00:59:33,610
<i>Hello?</i>

948
00:59:34,490 --> 00:59:35,670
<i>Hello?</i>

949
00:59:35,670 --> 00:59:39,550
[Kwang Soo was really
talking to the actress!]

950
00:59:39,550 --> 00:59:42,600
[And that person is...]

951
00:59:42,610 --> 00:59:48,150
[The goddess, Son Ye Jin.]

952
00:59:48,150 --> 00:59:49,920
- Hello?
- Hi.

953
00:59:50,870 --> 00:59:52,210
Hi, Ye Jin.

954
00:59:52,790 --> 00:59:55,510
- Hi
- This is Kwang Soo.

955
00:59:56,230 --> 00:59:57,130
<i>I know.</i>

956
00:59:57,130 --> 01:00:02,470
[Is she disappointed
to be talking to Kwang Soo?]

957
01:00:02,470 --> 01:00:05,070
<i>Why does it have to be you?
Why does it have to be you I'm talking to?</i>

958
01:00:08,070 --> 01:00:09,970
I'm very sorry for that.

959
01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:16,660
- You're sounding so awkward right now.
- I really don't know what to say!

960
01:00:16,660 --> 01:00:19,080
<i>You're acting like
one of the fake ones right now.</i>

961
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:23,770
We won, Ye Jin!

962
01:00:24,310 --> 01:00:25,960
I didn't know myself.

963
01:00:28,030 --> 01:00:29,450
She just laughed.

964
01:00:29,450 --> 01:00:31,050
[Is Jin Woon her fan?]

965
01:00:32,470 --> 01:00:35,250
- Hello.
- Hello!

966
01:00:35,250 --> 01:00:38,440
- Ye Jin!
- Stop pretending that you're her friend!

967
01:00:38,440 --> 01:00:39,810
- Ye Jin!
- Seriously!

968
01:00:39,810 --> 01:00:41,540
When are you coming on our show?

969
01:00:42,030 --> 01:00:43,650
- Hello?
- Hi, Ye Jin!

970
01:00:44,730 --> 01:00:46,360
I got married!

971
01:00:46,790 --> 01:00:48,420
I'm sorry!

972
01:00:49,470 --> 01:00:51,080
Ye Jin!

973
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:53,900
- What are you saying right now?
- No kidding. Why would she care?

974
01:00:55,720 --> 01:00:57,300
Where are you right now, Ye Jin?

975
01:00:57,520 --> 01:01:00,380
<i>I'm the spy today.</i>

976
01:01:00,380 --> 01:01:01,640
What?
You're the spy?

977
01:01:03,570 --> 01:01:09,550
[Is she still immersed in the spy role
that she played the last time she was on?]

978
01:01:09,890 --> 01:01:13,560
Ye Jin, who did you say was your favorite
member of Running Man was earlier?

979
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:15,400
<i>Gary.</i>

980
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:18,240
[Her favorite Running Man member?
Gary!]

981
01:01:24,500 --> 01:01:26,120
Of all people, she picks Gary?

982
01:01:26,120 --> 01:01:29,340
- Jong Kook is disappointed.
- After all the help I've given her?

983
01:01:29,340 --> 01:01:32,430
- I'll put Chief Byung Man on the phone.
- Yes, please.

984
01:01:33,250 --> 01:01:34,970
Hey, Ye Jin.

985
01:01:35,240 --> 01:01:37,620
- It's been a while.
[Acting like they're really close?]

986
01:01:37,620 --> 01:01:40,290
<i>Um, it's very nice to meet you.</i>

987
01:01:42,690 --> 01:01:44,960
I really wanted to act like
we were close.

988
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:46,680
- I really thought you two were close.
- I really wanted to act it.

989
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:49,090
- Ye Jin?
- Yes?

990
01:01:49,090 --> 01:01:51,790
I know that you're busy,
but it's nice to hear your voice.

991
01:01:51,790 --> 01:01:55,600
Well, I really do love Running Man.

992
01:01:55,600 --> 01:01:59,350
I know that you must be busy,
but if you can fit it into your schedule...

993
01:01:59,350 --> 01:02:01,050
- If you have the time...
- Okay, I'll come on the show again.

994
01:02:01,050 --> 01:02:02,870
- Yes, you should come back.
- Come back on our show.

995
01:02:02,870 --> 01:02:06,540
- Yes.
- We... we really like you!

996
01:02:07,360 --> 01:02:09,410
I love you!
I love you, Ye Jin!

997
01:02:09,410 --> 01:02:12,930
- Ye Jin... we really do like you.
- Ye Jin!

998
01:02:12,930 --> 01:02:14,530
I got married!

999
01:02:15,410 --> 01:02:17,400
Thank you, Ye Jin.

1000
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:20,260
- Yes, thank you.
- Thanks again.

1001
01:02:20,260 --> 01:02:25,340
[Miss Son Ye Jin, thank you for taking the
time out of your busy schedule to talk to us!]

1002
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:29,560
- She's just so pretty.
- She has such a kind heart.

1003
01:02:29,560 --> 01:02:31,750
- She really does have a pretty heart.
- In the midst of shooting her drama too.

1004
01:02:31,750 --> 01:02:34,490
She really did take the time out of her
precious schedule to help us out.

1005
01:02:34,490 --> 01:02:37,500
<i>Anyways, the important thing is that
Running Man Team won the first round.</i>

1006
01:02:42,320 --> 01:02:45,000
[With the score even at 1:1,
it's time for the final round.]

1007
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:46,360
It's the final round.

1008
01:02:47,510 --> 01:02:48,950
We'll win this.

1009
01:02:48,950 --> 01:02:51,010
- Come and get it!
- We'd like to challenge you!

1010
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:56,700
- Expert in acting.
- What is that?

1011
01:02:57,560 --> 01:03:00,830
Five of you are going to be sitting
in a very uncomfortable seat.

1012
01:03:00,840 --> 01:03:03,800
And just one of you will be sitting
in a comfortable seat.

1013
01:03:03,800 --> 01:03:05,340
- Thus...
- They have to find that person?

1014
01:03:05,340 --> 01:03:06,830
They have to find the person who really
is sitting in the comfortable chair.

1015
01:03:06,830 --> 01:03:09,530
- Then let's do the acting.
- We'll do the acting.

1016
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,540
Hey, no way!
Look at what we're sitting on! No way!

1017
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:16,850
[Oh my...]

1018
01:03:17,350 --> 01:03:19,860
[Even though it feels like sitting
on the sofa for the expert...]

1019
01:03:19,860 --> 01:03:25,020
[To us, it's a seat of torture.]

1020
01:03:25,930 --> 01:03:27,630
We'll guess!

1021
01:03:29,420 --> 01:03:32,180
- No, we'll act!
- I think it would be better for us to act.

1022
01:03:32,180 --> 01:03:34,890
- Let's act.
- Jae Suk, I sat on that thing before.

1023
01:03:34,890 --> 01:03:36,940
You can't act on that thing.

1024
01:03:36,940 --> 01:03:39,600
- Jae Suk, we can't do that.
- No, we'll do the acting.

1025
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:42,550
- Jae Suk, I've sat on that before.
- Jae Suk! We can't do that!

1026
01:03:43,340 --> 01:03:45,910
[Laws of the Jungle will be the one
to guess the actor this time.]

1027
01:03:45,910 --> 01:03:49,180
- This isn't going to be easy.
- I still sit on that when I'm home.

1028
01:03:49,180 --> 01:03:52,480
[The real expert using the cone for
a chair when he's at home?]

1029
01:03:54,380 --> 01:03:56,410
Just how painful is this thing?

1030
01:03:58,640 --> 01:04:01,130
Why did you say you want to do this?

1031
01:04:02,610 --> 01:04:04,070
- This is going to kill me.
- Ouch!

1032
01:04:05,330 --> 01:04:07,490
- Why did you say we were going to do it?
- I told you we should do the guessing!

1033
01:04:09,780 --> 01:04:12,700
[Ways to tell who's really
sitting on the cone.]

1034
01:04:13,680 --> 01:04:17,210
This is how they'll sit.
Their upper body is going to straighten out.

1035
01:04:18,200 --> 01:04:22,200
[It may even be possible to tell right away
if they're asked to shake in their seat!]

1036
01:04:25,580 --> 01:04:27,050
Let's just start this thing.

1037
01:04:27,050 --> 01:04:29,460
- Okay, please turn around.
- Turn around.

1038
01:04:29,460 --> 01:04:30,930
Set, go!

1039
01:04:33,740 --> 01:04:35,940
Can you straighten out your back
and say, 'Hooray'?

1040
01:04:35,940 --> 01:04:38,900
- Hooray!
- Hooray!

1041
01:04:40,970 --> 01:04:44,340
- Get up from your seats.
- Shouldn't we stay seated?

1042
01:04:44,350 --> 01:04:46,370
- Why?
- You can stand up.

1043
01:04:46,370 --> 01:04:49,360
But it's possible to hear the chair sound.
I don't think getting up is right.

1044
01:04:49,360 --> 01:04:51,030
We're already standing up.

1045
01:04:54,230 --> 01:04:55,920
Okay, sit back down.

1046
01:04:56,770 --> 01:04:58,710
- Stand up.
- Why are you doing this?

1047
01:04:58,710 --> 01:04:59,900
Sit back down.

1048
01:05:00,350 --> 01:05:02,310
Okay, time to start the wave.
Set, go!

1049
01:05:02,310 --> 01:05:03,850
Starting with Gary.

1050
01:05:14,540 --> 01:05:18,170
It's fine if you have to push yourself,
but I want you to turn a full circle.

1051
01:05:18,170 --> 01:05:19,960
- Like that?
- Sure, I can do that.

1052
01:05:19,960 --> 01:05:22,510
- I can do that.
- That's dangerous though.

1053
01:05:22,510 --> 01:05:23,950
Jae Suk can start.

1054
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:27,520
Gary can start then?

1055
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:29,470
That was very natural.

1056
01:05:34,150 --> 01:05:35,370
How did you do that?

1057
01:05:35,370 --> 01:05:36,820
How did you do it?

1058
01:05:37,550 --> 01:05:39,020
Do it the best you can.

1059
01:05:39,300 --> 01:05:41,330
Just support yourself and do it.

1060
01:05:43,710 --> 01:05:45,310
Spin around.

1061
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:50,770
- I bet that really hurts.
- Those three are out.

1062
01:05:50,770 --> 01:05:53,490
[The current three are sitting on the cone?]

1063
01:05:57,890 --> 01:05:59,400
I'm not sure.

1064
01:06:04,260 --> 01:06:05,960
2Guaranteed he's sitting on the cone.

1065
01:06:05,960 --> 01:06:09,920
- Guaranteed he's sitting on the cone.
- 5000 percent he is. I bet all my money.

1066
01:06:12,290 --> 01:06:13,770
Here I go.

1067
01:06:14,220 --> 01:06:16,920
Why did you come up with a
game like this?

1068
01:06:16,920 --> 01:06:19,000
Why do we have to sit on the cones?

1069
01:06:26,230 --> 01:06:29,430
[His face is turning beet red.]

1070
01:06:29,430 --> 01:06:31,250
His height is getting shorter by the second.

1071
01:06:31,250 --> 01:06:35,130
- Is that cone embedded in your body?
- I did it the best I could.

1072
01:06:35,770 --> 01:06:37,900
I really did it the best I could.

1073
01:06:37,900 --> 01:06:38,970
[Why don't we take a look?]

1074
01:06:39,930 --> 01:06:43,950
[Sitting and turning
right on top of the cone.]

1075
01:06:43,960 --> 01:06:48,020
[Wow...]

1076
01:06:50,490 --> 01:06:53,460
- I really did it right in the center.
- I did it on the center too.

1077
01:06:53,460 --> 01:06:55,410
- Are we all set then?
- I did it right in the center.

1078
01:06:55,410 --> 01:06:58,980
- I was right on.
- Why don't we ask them to do one more thing?

1079
01:06:58,980 --> 01:07:01,210
How about this? Asking them to
do this to the next person?

1080
01:07:01,780 --> 01:07:05,360
[Pressing down on the person
next to them.]

1081
01:07:08,900 --> 01:07:11,450
- That's a bit...
- Do you by chance have an ambulance ready?

1082
01:07:11,650 --> 01:07:13,090
If you do, then I'll do it.

1083
01:07:13,090 --> 01:07:15,980
Why don't you show us how
close you can be?

1084
01:07:15,980 --> 01:07:17,290
Starting with Gary.

1085
01:07:17,290 --> 01:07:20,280
Ji Hyo, you have to put
your weight on him.

1086
01:07:22,870 --> 01:07:24,390
Please don't do that.

1087
01:07:25,810 --> 01:07:27,300
Let's break up.

1088
01:07:33,820 --> 01:07:35,900
Wait.
Why are you pushing my hand away?

1089
01:07:36,300 --> 01:07:39,060
- Let's do it right.
- Why are you shoving my hand away?

1090
01:07:39,060 --> 01:07:40,800
Seriously, just do it right.

1091
01:07:47,960 --> 01:07:49,460
That's good!

1092
01:07:54,990 --> 01:07:56,200
Kwang Soo...

1093
01:07:56,200 --> 01:07:58,300
Please go easy on me.

1094
01:07:58,300 --> 01:08:00,580
- Kwang Soo...
- Can I get on his shoulders?

1095
01:08:01,220 --> 01:08:02,640
Yes, that's okay.

1096
01:08:07,990 --> 01:08:09,630
Don't do that!

1097
01:08:10,060 --> 01:08:11,670
What you're doing isn't right!

1098
01:08:14,200 --> 01:08:16,120
I bet Suk Jin has the
comfortable chair.

1099
01:08:16,120 --> 01:08:18,140
It's Jong Kook's turn?

1100
01:08:18,140 --> 01:08:21,470
[Yoo Hyuk to press down on Mr. Capable.]

1101
01:08:21,470 --> 01:08:26,330
[Mr. Capable refusing adamantly.]

1102
01:08:26,340 --> 01:08:27,890
You have to do it too!

1103
01:08:35,230 --> 01:08:37,160
You're the one who wanted to do it!

1104
01:08:37,160 --> 01:08:38,820
Let's see how well you do it.

1105
01:08:38,820 --> 01:08:41,410
[Jong Kook to press down on Jae Suk.]

1106
01:08:41,420 --> 01:08:43,270
- Go easy on me.
- Just easy on him.

1107
01:08:43,270 --> 01:08:44,910
Go easy.

1108
01:08:48,240 --> 01:08:51,410
How can you... how can you
press down right in the middle?

1109
01:08:54,560 --> 01:08:57,780
[Jae Suk's current situation.]

1110
01:09:00,160 --> 01:09:02,310
You have ten seconds to discuss your answer
and you have to say the name out loud.

1111
01:09:03,340 --> 01:09:05,480
This is hard.

1112
01:09:07,610 --> 01:09:12,150
As for the people that I'm sure about,
Jong Kook and Jae Suk are sitting on the cone.

1113
01:09:12,150 --> 01:09:13,300
Jong Kook?

1114
01:09:13,310 --> 01:09:16,290
[Who's the one person sitting
on the comfortable chair?]

1115
01:09:16,290 --> 01:09:18,130
- What about Suk Jin?
- It's either Gary or Ji Hyo.

1116
01:09:18,130 --> 01:09:19,670
I think it's Ji Hyo.

1117
01:09:19,670 --> 01:09:24,090
Don't you think it would be less
painful for Ji Hyo though?

1118
01:09:24,090 --> 01:09:26,300
- You may be right.
- Just hang on a little bit longer.

1119
01:09:26,750 --> 01:09:29,050
- I really can't stand it any longer.
- Can you hurry this along?

1120
01:09:29,680 --> 01:09:31,310
Why don't you come over here
and try sitting on it?

1121
01:09:31,310 --> 01:09:32,660
You give it a try!

1122
01:09:33,610 --> 01:09:37,520
- Did you even try this?
- Try a simulation before you do this again.

1123
01:09:37,910 --> 01:09:39,790
- You want to choose Gary or Ji Hyo?
- I think Gary.

1124
01:09:39,790 --> 01:09:41,680
- Gary?
- Let's go with Gary.

1125
01:09:41,680 --> 01:09:43,510
- One, two, three.
- Gary!

1126
01:09:43,510 --> 01:09:44,590
Gary!

1127
01:09:44,590 --> 01:09:48,030
[Gary is chosen to be the one
sitting on the comfortable chair.]

1128
01:09:48,030 --> 01:09:50,670
Just one of them are sitting
on a comfortable chair.

1129
01:09:50,670 --> 01:09:52,010
You chose Gary, right?

1130
01:09:52,010 --> 01:09:54,140
Let's check and see if you're right.
Look straight ahead.

1131
01:09:54,890 --> 01:09:56,770
[Time to reveal the answer.]

1132
01:09:57,460 --> 01:09:59,460
One...

1133
01:10:01,310 --> 01:10:02,490
Two...

1134
01:10:04,250 --> 01:10:05,360
Three.

1135
01:10:13,510 --> 01:10:14,660
Three.

1136
01:10:17,440 --> 01:10:21,010
[Jong Kook is the sitting on
the comfortable chair!]

1137
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:31,700
[They were deceived by
Mr. Capable's acting!]

1138
01:10:38,150 --> 01:10:39,930
I never even imagined it would be him!

1139
01:10:39,930 --> 01:10:42,000
Your acting really was...

1140
01:10:42,360 --> 01:10:45,310
- I did it with everything I had!
- I never even thought it would be him.

1141
01:10:45,310 --> 01:10:47,300
Jong Kook never does anything
that's bad for his health.

1142
01:10:48,080 --> 01:10:52,780
[Mr. Capable, the one who hates
being in pain the most...]

1143
01:10:52,780 --> 01:10:54,660
He never does anything
that's bad for his health.

1144
01:10:54,660 --> 01:10:56,390
I don't like having to endure any pain.

1145
01:10:58,210 --> 01:11:01,880
That's actually pointier than the ones
used the last time I was on the show.

1146
01:11:01,880 --> 01:11:04,800
And you turned 360 degrees on that thing.

1147
01:11:06,020 --> 01:11:10,460
[Time for the real expert
to show us his skills.]

1148
01:11:10,460 --> 01:11:13,510
- It's no big deal for Byung Man.
- This is comfortable for me.

1149
01:11:14,550 --> 01:11:16,150
This is comfortable for me.

1150
01:11:16,810 --> 01:11:19,590
That was very difficult for us.

1151
01:11:20,170 --> 01:11:23,170
Gary, can you spin around again?
How did you do that?

1152
01:11:23,180 --> 01:11:24,460
It gets deeper into you when you turn.

1153
01:11:24,460 --> 01:11:26,930
Gary just turned around on that thing.

1154
01:11:28,140 --> 01:11:30,400
[He's enduring it so well.]

1155
01:11:33,280 --> 01:11:35,050
We could see you sinking deeper into it.

1156
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:37,340
Do you know that you started
sinking in deeper?

1157
01:11:37,350 --> 01:11:39,490
- Try it. It's hard.
- Try sitting on it.

1158
01:11:41,010 --> 01:11:42,580
It's not easy.

1159
01:11:43,200 --> 01:11:45,340
What about the Fly-paper?
I bet he'd be good at it.

1160
01:11:45,340 --> 01:11:48,040
- Fly-paper can stick it out.
- Fly-paper can't do it.

1161
01:11:49,560 --> 01:11:51,960
See? I told you he can't do it.
This is extremely painful.

1162
01:11:51,960 --> 01:11:53,680
[Pain that can't be understood
until they experience it themselves.]

1163
01:11:53,690 --> 01:11:55,250
- How did you do that?
- You have no idea until you try it.

1164
01:11:55,250 --> 01:11:58,500
Thus, Running Man Team wins the
'Expert Competition'.

1165
01:11:58,500 --> 01:12:01,780
[Find the real expert!
Running Man Team wins!]

1166
01:12:02,790 --> 01:12:04,980
- You pick who you're going to send.
- Who's coming over?

1167
01:12:04,980 --> 01:12:10,860
[Who's the hostage that the losing team,
Laws of the Jungle is going to choose?]

1168
01:12:10,860 --> 01:12:13,800
I bet it's one of these three.
Jung Chul, Woo Jin or Ha Ha.

1169
01:12:14,690 --> 01:12:15,940
- Have you decided?
- Yes.

1170
01:12:15,940 --> 01:12:17,950
Then shout out the name
on the count of three.

1171
01:12:17,950 --> 01:12:21,000
- One, two, three.
- Noh Woo Jin.

1172
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:25,700
[Woo Jin is now a hostage of
the Running Man Team.]

1173
01:12:25,700 --> 01:12:26,730
What are we going to do now?

1174
01:12:27,830 --> 01:12:33,850
[Must take off the name tags off
the hostages first.]

1175
01:12:33,850 --> 01:12:36,600
[Exchanging their hostages.]

1176
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:41,120
[What role will the hostages be playing?]

1177
01:12:41,120 --> 01:12:43,600
We'll move on to the final location
with your hostages.

1178
01:12:46,510 --> 01:12:49,820
- Where are we going?
- To Paju movie village.

1179
01:12:51,790 --> 01:12:55,430
- Isn't being here better?
- It is since my junior is the chief.

1180
01:12:56,650 --> 01:12:58,880
So what is this all about then?

1181
01:12:58,880 --> 01:13:01,980
[The two hostages preferring
their current situation?]

1182
01:13:02,330 --> 01:13:04,380
Running Man, fighting!

1183
01:13:06,100 --> 01:13:08,550
I will do anything that I'm told to do.

1184
01:13:08,550 --> 01:13:10,660
Running Man, fighting!

1185
01:13:14,210 --> 01:13:18,060
[Final mission location-
Paju 'E' village.]

1186
01:13:18,060 --> 01:13:19,840
- Do you know what your crimes are?
- Which way do I go?

1187
01:13:19,840 --> 01:13:22,870
I shouted out, 'Running Man, fighting'
in the car about a hundred times.

1188
01:13:23,590 --> 01:13:25,800
- Come here!
- They said I didn't sound sincere.

1189
01:13:27,880 --> 01:13:29,480
How about letting the hostage read it?

1190
01:13:29,480 --> 01:13:32,220
- Here.
- Read it clearly in a loud voice.

1191
01:13:32,590 --> 01:13:34,890
Final mission, name tag elimination.

1192
01:13:35,200 --> 01:13:36,890
I can't feel your sincerity!

1193
01:13:37,290 --> 01:13:42,330
The team with the last surviving member in
the name tag elimination game wins.

1194
01:13:42,330 --> 01:13:46,050
But if you find your hostage and put
their name tag back on them

1195
01:13:46,060 --> 01:13:49,610
the hostage will then be able to
participate in the name tag elimination.

1196
01:13:50,600 --> 01:13:52,580
Who do you think you're
pointing at?

1197
01:13:54,650 --> 01:13:55,770
Let's lock them up somewhere.

1198
01:13:55,780 --> 01:13:58,910
[Both team to start the race after
locking up their hostages.]

1199
01:13:58,910 --> 01:14:01,320
We have to lock them up
somewhere safe.

1200
01:14:05,080 --> 01:14:07,770
[They can choose where they're going to
hide their hostages on their own.]

1201
01:14:07,770 --> 01:14:09,560
- It's nice in here.
- It's nice and warm in here.

1202
01:14:09,560 --> 01:14:11,570
Okay, then I'll just stay here.

1203
01:14:11,570 --> 01:14:13,420
[Hostage Jae Suk in lockdown.]

1204
01:14:13,420 --> 01:14:15,060
I'll sit here quietly.

1205
01:14:15,060 --> 01:14:17,280
[Hostage Noh Woo Jin in lockdown.]

1206
01:14:18,720 --> 01:14:22,290
[Hostage Big-nose being taken to
the shabbiest of the hiding places.]

1207
01:14:22,290 --> 01:14:24,130
[Hostage Big-nose in lockdown.]

1208
01:14:29,890 --> 01:14:33,360
[All the hostage lockdowns are now complete.]

1209
01:14:34,380 --> 01:14:36,840
[Just then!]

1210
01:14:36,840 --> 01:14:41,730
[Referees coming out of nowhere to
suddenly blindfold them.]

1211
01:14:42,590 --> 01:14:44,780
- What is this for?
- What are you doing?

1212
01:14:45,390 --> 01:14:48,270
- Are you taking us elsewhere?
- You're separating us?

1213
01:14:48,270 --> 01:14:51,570
[All the members being scattered about
and separated from one another.]

1214
01:14:52,920 --> 01:14:57,980
[Taking each player to a different place
with the blindfold over their eyes.]

1215
01:15:03,210 --> 01:15:08,350
<i>You can now take off your blindfolds
and start the game.</i>

1216
01:15:08,350 --> 01:15:12,800
<i>Three, two, one.
Game, start!</i>

1217
01:15:12,810 --> 01:15:16,110
[Running Man vs. Laws of the Jungle-
Chase game, Start!]

1218
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:19,480
[The real battle starts now!]

1219
01:15:26,300 --> 01:15:29,080
[Running Man vs. Laws of the Jungle.]

1220
01:15:34,920 --> 01:15:38,530
[The jungle team naturally blending in
to the bushes in their hunt.]

1221
01:15:49,320 --> 01:15:53,570
[Lightly flies up into the air to
climb up onto the wall!]

1222
01:15:53,570 --> 01:15:54,740
How are you going to get up here?

1223
01:16:00,350 --> 01:16:04,120
[Chief Byung Man
making his own path in his search.]

1224
01:16:13,410 --> 01:16:15,890
[Mr. Capable's surprise attack from
his ambush position!]

1225
01:16:16,680 --> 01:16:18,150
[And in the opposite direction
is Kwang Soo!]

1226
01:16:18,160 --> 01:16:19,250
Byung Man!

1227
01:16:24,130 --> 01:16:26,100
How am I supposed to catch him?

1228
01:16:26,760 --> 01:16:27,940
What the heck was that?

1229
01:16:27,980 --> 01:16:31,170
[Having escaped danger in lightning speed
to get himself back to safety!]

1230
01:16:31,170 --> 01:16:36,410
But... since he's never done it before,
he doesn't know to check his back.

1231
01:16:36,420 --> 01:16:38,620
He didn't see me hiding in the bushes.

1232
01:16:39,050 --> 01:16:43,350
[That's right...
it's all about ambush attacks today.]

1233
01:16:47,340 --> 01:16:51,370
[Jung Chul and Ha Ha on the other hand
are on a search for Noh Woo Jin.]

1234
01:16:52,650 --> 01:16:53,710
Noh Woo Jin!

1235
01:16:54,080 --> 01:16:55,570
Woo Jin.

1236
01:16:55,570 --> 01:16:57,010
Woo Jin!

1237
01:16:58,070 --> 01:16:59,430
Woo Jin.

1238
01:17:00,320 --> 01:17:01,330
Noh Woo Jin.

1239
01:17:01,340 --> 01:17:02,940
[Where is he?]

1240
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:05,560
We have to find Jae Suk.

1241
01:17:05,560 --> 01:17:09,270
[Ji Hyo and Jong Kook agreeing to
find their mate, Jae Suk first.]

1242
01:17:18,200 --> 01:17:20,740
[Huh?]

1243
01:17:20,740 --> 01:17:22,610
[He found him!]

1244
01:17:24,360 --> 01:17:27,950
[Hye Bin having lying in wait
in the empty refrigerator!]

1245
01:17:30,540 --> 01:17:32,010
[An ambush!]

1246
01:17:36,970 --> 01:17:38,470
- Please don't do that.
- Jong Kook...

1247
01:17:40,510 --> 01:17:41,720
- Please don't do that.
- Jong Kook...

1248
01:17:42,590 --> 01:17:44,500
[Stuttering his words from
the shock of her attack.]

1249
01:17:44,500 --> 01:17:46,200
- I have no choice but to eliminate you.
- You can't.

1250
01:17:46,210 --> 01:17:48,650
- Hye Jin...
- You can't use force on a girl like this.

1251
01:17:48,660 --> 01:17:50,100
Just get out of here then.

1252
01:17:50,110 --> 01:17:51,790
Ji Hyo!
Hurry up and help me!

1253
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:52,890
[Just then!
Blank Ji appears to rescue him!]

1254
01:17:52,890 --> 01:17:56,690
[Savior Blank Ji coming to rescue Kkuk,
who's known for his weakness towards women.]

1255
01:17:56,690 --> 01:17:58,790
- Just grab onto her.
- Are you putting that on me?

1256
01:17:58,790 --> 01:18:00,890
[Kkuk uses that moment to reattach
Jae Suk's name tag onto his back.]

1257
01:18:03,740 --> 01:18:06,440
[Running Man Team rescues Jae Suk
from his imprisonment!]

1258
01:18:06,450 --> 01:18:09,320
I had no idea that it would be Jong Kook.
Wait!

1259
01:18:10,470 --> 01:18:12,030
- Please don't!
- Hye Bin...

1260
01:18:12,290 --> 01:18:14,870
[Jeon Hye Bin - Out!]

1261
01:18:15,580 --> 01:18:20,320
[Hye Bin unfortunately gets ousted after
staying hidden in the fridge for 30 minutes.]

1262
01:18:20,610 --> 01:18:22,130
We had no choice.

1263
01:18:26,770 --> 01:18:30,400
[On the other hand, players are starting to
face-off with each other in various spots.]

1264
01:18:34,040 --> 01:18:37,490
[If they let their guard down even for a
second, they're sure to get ousted!]

1265
01:18:42,960 --> 01:18:46,220
[Ha Ha - Out!]

1266
01:18:49,410 --> 01:18:53,720
<i>[Ha Ha, out.
Ha Ha, out.]</i>

1267
01:18:55,880 --> 01:18:57,870
<i>We are Running Man!</i>

1268
01:18:59,330 --> 01:19:01,710
Running Man forever!

1269
01:19:01,710 --> 01:19:04,590
[So you're back to your sanity...]

1270
01:19:07,040 --> 01:19:10,140
Jong Kook!

1271
01:19:11,200 --> 01:19:12,370
Jong Kook.

1272
01:19:15,390 --> 01:19:17,000
He saw me, he saw me!

1273
01:19:17,230 --> 01:19:19,330
He saw me.

1274
01:19:19,330 --> 01:19:20,950
Gary... Gary!

1275
01:19:21,360 --> 01:19:25,240
[Flagging down Gary who's
holding onto Suk Jin's name tag!]

1276
01:19:25,240 --> 01:19:27,150
Hurry up and go in there.
He's to the left!

1277
01:19:27,150 --> 01:19:28,220
Suk Jin!

1278
01:19:28,880 --> 01:19:30,300
- Suk Jin, where are you?
- I'm over here!

1279
01:19:30,300 --> 01:19:31,820
- Over here!
- Where?

1280
01:19:31,820 --> 01:19:35,470
[If he rescues Suk Jin, all members
of the Running Man Team remains!]

1281
01:19:36,250 --> 01:19:37,780
- Come over here.
- Where are you?

1282
01:19:37,790 --> 01:19:39,750
I'm behind the stage.

1283
01:19:39,750 --> 01:19:42,820
[Gary discovers Suk Jin!]

1284
01:19:43,130 --> 01:19:45,300
- It's a total war outside.
- What?

1285
01:19:45,300 --> 01:19:46,570
- Okay, let's go!
- Quickly.

1286
01:19:47,060 --> 01:19:49,710
[Succeeds in rescuing Suk Jin
from his imprisonment!]

1287
01:19:49,710 --> 01:19:51,440
This is going to be an easy win.

1288
01:19:51,440 --> 01:19:54,130
[Running Man Team may win
much easier than expected?]

1289
01:19:55,070 --> 01:20:01,120
[There's no way...
we'll allow that to happen!]

1290
01:20:01,790 --> 01:20:04,730
[Even the Easy Brothers are
basking in their elation today.]

1291
01:20:05,520 --> 01:20:07,980
Pil-Chok-Cross!

1292
01:20:08,960 --> 01:20:10,660
Why don't we have a face-off?

1293
01:20:10,660 --> 01:20:11,940
Man to man.

1294
01:20:13,380 --> 01:20:15,700
[Climbing onto the tree?]

1295
01:20:16,340 --> 01:20:20,400
[It seems his plan is to use his unique
talents from Laws of the Jungle?]

1296
01:20:22,060 --> 01:20:24,010
[Kwang Soo turns his attack
on Jin Woon!]

1297
01:20:26,710 --> 01:20:30,330
[An intense 2:2 face-off that they can't
stray their concentration away from!]

1298
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:36,220
[The chief and Jin Woon are retreating?]

1299
01:20:36,220 --> 01:20:38,450
Those two are the strongest players
from the jungle team.

1300
01:20:38,610 --> 01:20:41,100
- Let's break them.
- We can eliminate them.

1301
01:20:41,930 --> 01:20:43,580
Pil-Chok-Cross.

1302
01:20:44,370 --> 01:20:47,490
[Totally different glint in their eyes.]

1303
01:20:47,490 --> 01:20:50,960
- The Easy Brothers are going to oust you two.
- Suk Jin, don't back away from them.

1304
01:20:50,960 --> 01:20:52,800
Suk Jin, you have to face them.

1305
01:20:53,300 --> 01:20:56,700
[Now that they've come to their senses,
they realize that they're retreating.]

1306
01:20:56,700 --> 01:20:58,130
Let's not be like this!

1307
01:21:01,100 --> 01:21:03,040
[Facing each other once again!]

1308
01:21:03,040 --> 01:21:04,570
Are you kidding around right now?

1309
01:21:07,130 --> 01:21:10,570
[Easy Brothers standing their ground!]

1310
01:21:10,570 --> 01:21:12,170
Hey, Kwang Soo!
Are you getting him?

1311
01:21:12,170 --> 01:21:13,700
What the heck is this!

1312
01:21:13,700 --> 01:21:15,310
[Byung Man attacks from below!]

1313
01:21:20,590 --> 01:21:23,810
[Take down! Brings Kwang Soo down by
crumbling his balance with his leg!]

1314
01:21:27,840 --> 01:21:31,970
[Within moments...
he turns the battle around!]

1315
01:21:38,180 --> 01:21:40,350
[He eliminates Giraffe's name tag!]

1316
01:21:42,070 --> 01:21:44,000
[And heads straight towards
Impala right away!]

1317
01:21:51,380 --> 01:21:54,140
[Impala's name tag eliminated!]

1318
01:21:56,410 --> 01:21:59,280
What the heck?
Is he allowed to use methods like that?

1319
01:22:00,920 --> 01:22:02,910
He was using his martial arts
moves on me!

1320
01:22:02,910 --> 01:22:05,170
[Easy Brothers having been
taken down by force.]

1321
01:22:06,060 --> 01:22:07,460
- Let's finish this.
- Yes.

1322
01:22:07,460 --> 01:22:09,730
[Is this the sing of
Laws of the Jungle Team's win?]

1323
01:22:15,820 --> 01:22:20,820
[Laws of the Jungle Team manages to
free their member Woo Jin from his jail.]

1324
01:22:21,730 --> 01:22:23,270
Should we just go get them?

1325
01:22:23,270 --> 01:22:24,610
Woo Jin!

1326
01:22:25,330 --> 01:22:28,990
The Jung, the Jung, the Laws of
the Jungle! Fighting!

1327
01:22:30,910 --> 01:22:32,110
Hey!

1328
01:22:32,110 --> 01:22:33,910
- Woo Jin!
- Sorry, Jong Kook!

1329
01:22:34,500 --> 01:22:37,120
- You're really...
- I'm sorry!

1330
01:22:38,090 --> 01:22:39,760
Let's go this way.
Jae Suk, this way.

1331
01:22:39,770 --> 01:22:41,750
[Planning out their moves
to capture Woo Jin!]

1332
01:22:44,800 --> 01:22:48,100
They went that way!
Jin Woon! They went that way!

1333
01:22:50,810 --> 01:22:52,290
Look out.
You have to look out over there.

1334
01:22:53,220 --> 01:22:54,340
[Byung Man having been lying in wait...]

1335
01:22:54,340 --> 01:22:57,300
[Heads straight towards Jae Suk!]

1336
01:22:57,300 --> 01:22:58,750
Where did you come from?

1337
01:23:02,150 --> 01:23:04,270
[Waiting to attack him from behind!]

1338
01:23:07,130 --> 01:23:10,440
[Big match-
Jae Suk vs. Byung Man!]

1339
01:23:10,440 --> 01:23:11,630
Grab him.
Grab him right now.

1340
01:23:11,830 --> 01:23:14,310
[Woo Jin coming to join the fight!]

1341
01:23:15,870 --> 01:23:18,860
[Just then, Gary rushes in
to help Jae Suk!]

1342
01:23:24,950 --> 01:23:29,210
[Ace Ji Hyo in extreme danger!]

1343
01:23:29,870 --> 01:23:32,380
[Ji Hyo's in danger!]

1344
01:23:33,540 --> 01:23:36,160
[Yoo-ruce Willis rushing in to rescue her!]

1345
01:23:38,660 --> 01:23:40,960
[Woo Jin's surprise attack!]

1346
01:23:40,960 --> 01:23:42,570
[Gary coming in to guard him!]

1347
01:23:49,020 --> 01:23:51,290
[Succeeds in eliminating
Woo Jin's name tag!]

1348
01:23:52,850 --> 01:23:55,160
[Mr. Capable Jong Kook!]

1349
01:23:57,010 --> 01:24:00,360
[Eliminates Jung Chul's name tag!]

1350
01:24:03,530 --> 01:24:11,480
<i>Noh Woo Jin, out!
Park Jung Chul, out!</i>

1351
01:24:11,480 --> 01:24:16,640
[Jungle Team is back in danger.
Byung Man and Jin Woon are the sole survivors!]

1352
01:24:18,540 --> 01:24:19,760
Let's finish this.

1353
01:24:20,750 --> 01:24:26,260
[Running Man Team's survivors-
Jae Suk, Jong Kook, Gary and Ji Hyo!]

1354
01:24:26,260 --> 01:24:29,810
[All the experts in
the chase are still alive!]

1355
01:24:29,810 --> 01:24:35,790
[What is the jungle team's plan?]

1356
01:24:37,050 --> 01:24:40,070
Wow... earlier, Byung Man...

1357
01:24:40,440 --> 01:24:43,030
I saw him climbing up there earlier.

1358
01:24:43,030 --> 01:24:45,610
- Did you see him climb this, Ji Hyo?
- Yes, I saw it.

1359
01:24:45,610 --> 01:24:47,410
It was no joke.

1360
01:24:47,410 --> 01:24:50,790
- He climbed up there like it was nothing.
- He just flew up there.

1361
01:24:53,410 --> 01:24:57,080
Byung Man, seriously...
how do you climb up the tree so easily?

1362
01:24:57,080 --> 01:24:59,990
[Nothing they can even do while
watching him do what he did.]

1363
01:25:02,380 --> 01:25:04,110
The tree?
I can climb it too.

1364
01:25:04,110 --> 01:25:06,990
- You can do that too, Kang Gary?
- Of course, I can. Anyone can do it.

1365
01:25:08,020 --> 01:25:09,950
Anyone can do that.
Why can't I?

1366
01:25:13,230 --> 01:25:14,400
But...

1367
01:25:15,880 --> 01:25:20,630
I think in our situation, it's better to face
them whether it works out or not.

1368
01:25:21,060 --> 01:25:23,140
If we keep this up, I think
we'll be chasing each other all night.

1369
01:25:24,510 --> 01:25:29,640
[If they keep running, there will be no end!
No other choice but to face them!]

1370
01:25:30,730 --> 01:25:32,460
[And just then, the only two that they see
in their view are Ji Hyo and Gary.]

1371
01:25:34,110 --> 01:25:36,310
We shouldn't stay separated.

1372
01:25:38,120 --> 01:25:40,760
[Gary getting flustered after
seeing them move in on them.]

1373
01:25:42,410 --> 01:25:44,610
[Byung Man and Jin Woon
move in on Gary!]

1374
01:25:44,610 --> 01:25:47,390
[But Gary is a master of fighting
who is eighth level in martial arts!]

1375
01:25:49,430 --> 01:25:51,650
[Byung Man turns his attack on Ji Hyo!]

1376
01:25:52,160 --> 01:25:55,930
[Guard Gary rushes in to protect her.]

1377
01:26:00,110 --> 01:26:03,640
What are you all doing right now
with me in the middle?

1378
01:26:10,600 --> 01:26:13,440
[Sees a chance and ousts Ji Hyo!]

1379
01:26:14,020 --> 01:26:17,410
[Turns their attack on Gary immediately!]

1380
01:26:17,410 --> 01:26:21,200
[Even though it's Gary,
taking on those two is a tough feat.]

1381
01:26:22,190 --> 01:26:23,740
Gary, you're really fast!

1382
01:26:26,280 --> 01:26:28,380
[In the blink of an eye,
it turns into a bloody battle!]

1383
01:26:28,380 --> 01:26:29,880
Grab one of his arms.

1384
01:26:31,770 --> 01:26:34,310
[Oh... if it stays like that...]

1385
01:26:36,100 --> 01:26:37,360
[The hand on the name tag!]

1386
01:26:39,320 --> 01:26:41,350
[Jin Woon's hand slips!]

1387
01:26:45,180 --> 01:26:49,370
[Comrade Yoo-ruce Willis arrives!]

1388
01:26:51,210 --> 01:26:54,950
[Gary having withstood their attack!]

1389
01:26:56,540 --> 01:26:58,580
- If it was just one of them...
- Let's go, Jin Woon.

1390
01:26:58,580 --> 01:27:00,440
Let's get some rest before we continue.

1391
01:27:01,030 --> 01:27:02,550
- Let's rest up a little.
- Are you okay, Gary?

1392
01:27:02,550 --> 01:27:05,390
[A brief break time from their exhaustion.]

1393
01:27:06,410 --> 01:27:09,160
- Wow, Gary... he's so fast!
- I know.

1394
01:27:09,160 --> 01:27:11,790
[Extremely surprised by the swiftness
and the skills of Running Man members.]

1395
01:27:15,290 --> 01:27:16,740
I almost got eliminated.

1396
01:27:17,400 --> 01:27:20,180
- How was it?
- I thought I was in a street fight.

1397
01:27:21,210 --> 01:27:23,410
It's a relief that I was able to
help you just in time.

1398
01:27:23,410 --> 01:27:26,930
You know that feeling of wishing that
just someone will come to help you out?

1399
01:27:27,960 --> 01:27:31,800
- Where in the world is Jong Kook?
- I don't know, he's always off somewhere.

1400
01:27:31,800 --> 01:27:34,210
I don't know what he's off
doing by himself.

1401
01:27:34,220 --> 01:27:36,560
I have no idea where he went.

1402
01:27:41,630 --> 01:27:48,450
[How frustrating...
I will get a chance to ambush them!]

1403
01:27:49,780 --> 01:27:56,180
Wow... I never thought the anxiety level
would be this bad from watching it on TV.

1404
01:27:56,180 --> 01:27:57,240
Did you really feel anxious?

1405
01:27:57,240 --> 01:28:00,470
When I was being held hostage,
I really thought I was a hostage.

1406
01:28:00,470 --> 01:28:02,720
So you realized what it's like?

1407
01:28:04,380 --> 01:28:05,940
- Oh! It's Ji Hyo!
- Ji Hyo!

1408
01:28:06,610 --> 01:28:09,690
- Who ousted you?
- Jin Woon.

1409
01:28:09,690 --> 01:28:12,670
[Ace also enters the tiny jail cell.]

1410
01:28:13,220 --> 01:28:15,360
Can't you give us a bigger cell?

1411
01:28:16,500 --> 01:28:20,840
- I really feel like we're in jail.
- Can't you give us some snacks or something?

1412
01:28:23,150 --> 01:28:24,540
So that we can munch on something?

1413
01:28:26,270 --> 01:28:29,380
- I'm really hungry.
- Can you feed us?

1414
01:28:31,090 --> 01:28:34,200
[Like the calm before the storm...]

1415
01:28:34,200 --> 01:28:37,900
[In the midst of the calm eeriness...]

1416
01:28:43,880 --> 01:28:45,270
- There they are.
- Where?

1417
01:28:45,270 --> 01:28:46,990
They're over there.

1418
01:28:48,650 --> 01:28:53,900
[Jae Suk and Gary coming face to face
with Byung Man and Jin Woon!]

1419
01:28:55,680 --> 01:29:00,310
- This is such tight quarters.
- Jong Kook... we have to keep an eye out.

1420
01:29:03,590 --> 01:29:05,480
I wonder where Jong Kook is?

1421
01:29:14,190 --> 01:29:15,710
Don't go too far ahead.

1422
01:29:15,710 --> 01:29:18,090
We have to stick together.

1423
01:29:24,090 --> 01:29:26,840
They're wondering where Jong Kook is.
They're nervous about Jong Kook.

1424
01:29:28,080 --> 01:29:31,380
[Not able to get too close in case
Mr. Capable is lying in wait for them.]

1425
01:29:36,660 --> 01:29:38,020
There's no one else here.

1426
01:29:40,150 --> 01:29:41,840
Where's Jong Kook?

1427
01:29:43,020 --> 01:29:45,110
We don't know where
Jong Kook is either.

1428
01:29:49,030 --> 01:29:51,790
[Nervous energy!]

1429
01:29:51,790 --> 01:29:54,350
You have this gentle smile
on your face...

1430
01:29:54,350 --> 01:29:55,940
but your body feels like a rock.

1431
01:29:55,940 --> 01:29:58,160
- How are you so strong?
- You really are strong.

1432
01:29:58,160 --> 01:30:01,190
[The strength of Running Man members
that the Jungle Team is shocked by!]

1433
01:30:01,190 --> 01:30:04,070
- I got stronger since starting Running Man.
- You're all so strong!

1434
01:30:04,640 --> 01:30:06,970
- Ever since I started Running Man...
- We got stronger since Running Man.

1435
01:30:07,630 --> 01:30:10,620
[Their muscles having come from
all the chasing around they've done.]

1436
01:30:11,410 --> 01:30:13,370
Both of you are really strong.

1437
01:30:14,030 --> 01:30:15,610
Let's end it right here.

1438
01:30:17,350 --> 01:30:19,310
[It's time to decide who
the victor will be!]

1439
01:30:19,310 --> 01:30:21,720
[A face to face battle!]

1440
01:30:23,130 --> 01:30:25,830
[Imminent attack!]

1441
01:30:32,720 --> 01:30:35,030
[Jae Suk's back is left unguarded!]

1442
01:30:36,140 --> 01:30:38,230
[Byung Man seizes the opportunity
and moves in on Jae Suk!]

1443
01:30:41,480 --> 01:30:43,830
[Yoo Jae Suk - Out!]

1444
01:30:45,610 --> 01:30:47,730
Where in the world is Kim Jong Kook?

1445
01:30:48,420 --> 01:30:50,860
[Two against one!
Gary is in danger!]

1446
01:30:50,860 --> 01:30:52,370
Hey!

1447
01:30:54,260 --> 01:30:57,710
[Mr. Capable moves in!]

1448
01:30:58,300 --> 01:31:01,190
[An ambush attack!]

1449
01:31:02,820 --> 01:31:05,930
[Jin Woon retreats as
Mr. Capable moves in!]

1450
01:31:07,250 --> 01:31:09,590
Jong Kook!
I'm not ousted yet! Hurry!

1451
01:31:10,440 --> 01:31:13,000
[Jin Woon using every ounce of strength he
has to stand up to Mr. Capable!]

1452
01:31:13,720 --> 01:31:16,250
[Jong Kook, please...]

1453
01:31:17,620 --> 01:31:20,660
[Having endured it for a long while,
Gary ultimately gets ousted.]

1454
01:31:20,660 --> 01:31:24,270
[That means there's only one person
left remaining...]

1455
01:31:24,270 --> 01:31:29,180
[I'm... Running Man's Mr. Capable!]

1456
01:31:31,320 --> 01:31:35,020
[Laws of the Jungle's Byung Man and Jin Woon
vs. Running Man's Mr. Capable.]

1457
01:31:35,020 --> 01:31:36,520
Wow... he's freakishly strong!

1458
01:31:36,520 --> 01:31:38,340
He's several times stronger than Gary.

1459
01:31:40,100 --> 01:31:42,970
[Come and get me!]

1460
01:31:46,220 --> 01:31:48,850
[The final face-off with both
the teams' pride on the line!]

1461
01:31:52,240 --> 01:31:53,830
We have to get him!

1462
01:31:59,360 --> 01:32:02,850
[Wow! He throws his body
down in a defensive mode!]

1463
01:32:06,520 --> 01:32:09,830
[But Jong Kook gets his hand
on Byung Man's name tag again!]

1464
01:32:11,460 --> 01:32:13,480
[Chief Byung Man, out!]

1465
01:32:13,590 --> 01:32:16,200
[Oh my!]

1466
01:32:18,670 --> 01:32:23,070
[Jin Woon... gets his hand...
on Mr. Capable's name tag!]

1467
01:32:27,860 --> 01:32:31,690
[Jin Woon...]

1468
01:32:31,690 --> 01:32:33,750
[Eliminated...]

1469
01:32:33,750 --> 01:32:36,800
[Mr. Capable's name tag!]

1470
01:32:36,800 --> 01:32:38,290
- What happened?
- What happened?

1471
01:32:39,060 --> 01:32:41,740
The Jung, the Jung,
