00:05:47,412 --> 00:05:52,500
There are some unbelievable woman still
waiting to come out back there. You just wait.

104
00:05:52,501 --> 00:05:55,678
But when I saw their retreating backs,

105
00:05:56,005 --> 00:05:57,605
[And continuing on...]

- I felt the hot flames coming towards me.

110
00:06:17,596 --> 00:06:19,747
- We saw you running.
- Why did you gain so much weight?

111
00:06:19,748 --> 00:06:22,029
I had no idea that I'd be called out
so early in the morning.

112
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:24,635
I made two bowls of ramen before
I went to bed last night.

113
00:06:24,636 --> 00:06:26,725
[Unaware of the early filming schedule,
she ate two bowls of ramen before bed.]

114
00:06:27,448 --> 00:06:30,220

- I was the weakest woman back there.
- Seriously?

117
00:06:35,574 --> 00:06:37,452
Yes. There are some
fierce women back there.

118
00:06:37,453 --> 00:06:38,551
I wonder who else is back there.

119
00:06:38,551 --> 00:06:40,071
Number six who still didn't get burned
in that situation...

120
00:06:40,072 --> 00:06:42,003
I'm curious to see how fierce
that woman is.

121
00:06:42,004 --> 00:06:45,061
[The last screen that's still standing
remaining untouched after that chaos...]

122
00:06:45,438 --> 00:06:47,710
[Frightening for some reason...]

123
00:06:47,711 --> 00:06:51,616
When all the screens caught on fire,
we all started screaming and getting scared

124
00:06:51,617 --> 00:06:53,155

00:06:57,934 --> 00:07:01,801
[Just who could it be?]

128
00:07:02,336 --> 00:07:05,476

please come on out!</i>

129
00:07:05,477 --> 00:07:07,630
- Who is it?
- It's not a man, is it?

130
00:07:07,631 --> 00:07:09,684
No, it's Song Eun Ee.

131

- I barely walked over here in this thing.

136
00:07:23,628 --> 00:07:26,293

[Yoo Hyuk embarrassed to see his friend
of 20 years wearing a skirt.]

138
00:07:31,121 --> 00:07:33,166
- Why are you wearing that?
- Why?

139
00:07:33,167 --> 00:07:35,137
I wore it to look pretty.
What!

140
00:07:35,958 --> 00:07:39,959
[Her friend not knowing what to do from his
embarrassment of seeing her in a skirt.]

141
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:43,073
- Just put your regular sweat pants on.
- I wore it because I was told to wear it!

142
00:07:43,074 --> 00:07:45,577
- What are you doing?
- I was told to wear it!

143
00:07:45,578 --> 00:07:47,752
- I'm so scared of her like that.
- What is she doing dressed like that?

144
00:07:47,753 --> 00:07:50,113
- What is this?
- Why are you dressed like that?

145
00:07:50,114 --> 00:07:52,686
- Why did you dress her in a skirt?
- Why did you tell her to dress like that?

146
00:07:52,687 --> 00:07:55,824
- I can't stand seeing her like that!
- Stop that! Stop doing that!

147
00:07:57,605 --> 00:08:01,326
[Just because she's in a skirt doesn't mean
that her nature hasn't gone anywhere.]

148
00:08:01,327 --> 00:08:04,013
- Seriously.
- Seriously!

149
00:08:04,014 --> 00:08:06,120
Why are you guys all frowning like that?

150
00:08:06,121 --> 00:08:08,161
Is this the best you
can treat a guest on your show?

151
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:11,454
- Stand with your legs closed together.
- I do have them closed.

152
00:08:11,713 --> 00:08:14,318
Let's all give her a round of applause.

153
00:08:15,645 --> 00:08:20,521
If we're not teamed up with either Ri Sae
or Ji Hyo, then it's all over.

154

- Did I shock you? Were you really shocked?
- I was really shocked.

155

[Time for the fifth gumiho
to make her entrance.]

157

- Is it going to get worse?
- Can't you tell by how this is going?

158
00:08:32,067 --> 00:08:33,843
- Who is it?
- Is it someone pretty?

159
00:08:34,215 --> 00:08:36,764

00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:53,367
- Park So Hyun!
- Park So Hyun!

164
00:08:53,368 --> 00:08:56,856
[A total different response from Eun Ee
who's also in her 40's like So Hyun.]

165
00:08:56,857 --> 00:08:58,512
- What a relief!
- It's Park So Hyun!

166
00:08:58,513 --> 00:09:01,119
- I don't know if she'll remember.
- She has a bad memory.

167
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,155
- Do you remember me? It's me, Ha Ha.
- She has really bad memory.

168
00:09:03,156 --> 00:09:07,301
[She's known for her forgetfulness.]

169
00:09:07,302 --> 00:09:08,996
- Wow, this is really...
- Okay.

170
00:09:09,728 --> 00:09:13,347
Do you have a vague idea of what
these numbers mean by now?

171
00:09:13,348 --> 00:09:17,064
- Is it their age group or something?
- Number six, please come on out!

172
00:09:18,436 --> 00:09:21,164
[At last...]

173
00:09:21,165 --> 00:09:26,757
[The sixth, and the final gumiho.]

174
00:09:28,853 --> 00:09:31,096
- Look at how pretty she is.
- She's pretty!

175
00:09:31,097 --> 00:09:33,088
[She's... pretty?]

176
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:46,329
[Automatically breaking out into
an expression of shock.]

177
00:09:49,212 --> 00:09:53,049
[The godmother of comedy,
Kim Soo Mi is here!]

178
00:09:53,777 --> 00:09:55,847
[Her overwhelming charisma!]

179
00:09:55,848 --> 00:09:57,301
[Unstoppable force and power!]

180
00:09:59,315 --> 00:10:03,070
[She is here!]

181
00:10:03,071 --> 00:10:05,182
[So nice to be here!]

182
00:10:05,568 --> 00:10:08,725
[All the men quieting down
at the sight of seeing her.]

183
00:10:08,726 --> 00:10:11,039
- We didn't know it was you.
- We had no idea that it was you.

184
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,430
I had no idea.

185
00:10:12,431 --> 00:10:14,497
- Wow...
- You look so beautiful.

186
00:10:14,498 --> 00:10:16,557
What a sweet sack of lies.

187
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:19,682
[She really is one fierce woman!]

188
00:10:19,683 --> 00:10:22,858
Wow... I really had no idea.

189
00:10:22,859 --> 00:10:25,720
- I had no idea.
- They really don't tell you?

190
00:10:25,721 --> 00:10:27,089
No, we had no idea.

191
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:30,786
<i>I will explain to you how
The Gumiho Race is going to play out.</i>

192
00:10:31,579 --> 00:10:35,264
<i>All the guests that are on here today
are our loveable gumihos.</i>

193
00:10:35,299 --> 00:10:37,180
Yes, they are.

194
00:10:37,181 --> 00:10:39,144
- We love them!
- Yes, we do.

195
00:10:39,495 --> 00:10:41,663
- What's wrong with your expression, Jae Suk?
- Excuse me?

196
00:10:41,664 --> 00:10:43,107
- What's wrong with your expression?
- Right now...

197
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:45,907
I was just thinking to myself that there
aren't many knockouts here.

198
00:10:47,894 --> 00:10:52,535
And this is the second time in my life
seeing Eun Ee in a skirt.

199
00:10:53,177 --> 00:10:59,621
<i>Okay, each of the gumihos will seduce
one man to be their partner in a team.</i>

200
00:11:00,433 --> 00:11:03,157
How about instead of seducing a man,
we just gobble one up?

201
00:11:05,158 --> 00:11:09,244
<i>I will first tell you how many tails
each of the gumiho has.</i>

202
00:11:09,564 --> 00:11:11,475
Kim Soo Mi has six tails.

203
00:11:11,476 --> 00:11:15,071
Park So Hyun and Song Eun Ee
each have four tails.

204
00:11:15,072 --> 00:11:18,561
And Kim Suk and Song Ji Hyo
each have three tails.

205
00:11:18,562 --> 00:11:22,358
And Ri Sae has two tails to start off with.

206
00:11:22,359 --> 00:11:24,702
I guess it's more advantageous to
be teamed up with Kim Soo Mi.

207
00:11:24,703 --> 00:11:28,016
- Since she already has six.
- Yeah, which means she only needs three more.

208
00:11:28,017 --> 00:11:32,289
Each of the gumihos needs to seduce
the man they're going to team up with.

209
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:36,746
Each of the men will have a brief chance to
showcase their attractiveness to the gumihos.

210
00:11:37,106 --> 00:11:39,579
There aren't many knockouts amongst
you men either.

211
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:42,056
- What are you talking about?
- What are you saying?

212
00:11:42,057 --> 00:11:45,159
- Just like you said earlier...
- We're all good catches over here!

213
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:47,308
No, there is one knockout.

214
00:11:47,309 --> 00:11:49,501
- There's only one?
- There's only one.

215
00:11:49,502 --> 00:11:50,812
- Yes, there is one.
- Really?

216
00:11:50,813 --> 00:11:53,055
- Who could she mean?
- The person who said, 'Really'.

217
00:11:57,259 --> 00:12:02,843
[Just then, an appropriate song
starts playing in the background.]

218
00:12:02,844 --> 00:12:04,243
We don't have that kind of a relationship!

219
00:12:04,752 --> 00:12:06,785
We don't have that kind of a relationship!

220
00:12:06,786 --> 00:12:09,528
[It seems as though Kkuk
has already been marked.]

221
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:13,667
You each have one chance to say
something quick about yourselves.

222
00:12:13,667 --> 00:12:17,883
Ji Hyo, if there's anything that I haven't
been really nice to you about in the past...

223
00:12:17,918 --> 00:12:20,017
I will apologize to you
for them all right now.

224
00:12:20,018 --> 00:12:22,148
Ji Hyo, I've always thought...

225
00:12:22,149 --> 00:12:24,894
- Ji Hyo, it's Monday today!
- Ji Hyo!

226
00:12:24,895 --> 00:12:28,251
Ji Hyo, since the very beginning...
I've always liked you from the beginning.

227
00:12:28,252 --> 00:12:30,631
Ji Hyo, you've always been
so beautiful to me.

228
00:12:30,632 --> 00:12:34,135
Ji Hyo, you and I used to be so close.
I love you!

229
00:12:34,796 --> 00:12:37,298
Gumihos will start their selection
according to their age.

230
00:12:37,299 --> 00:12:39,942
We will start with Kim Soo Mi.

231
00:12:40,578 --> 00:12:42,479
She has six tails.

232
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,967
Yes, she has the biggest advantage.

233
00:12:43,968 --> 00:12:46,524
Jae Suk has always been very
good with elders.

234
00:12:48,615 --> 00:12:51,628
[Going around checking out
their physical condition?]

235
00:12:52,584 --> 00:12:55,022
She looks like she's at the cattle market
trying to pick her cattle.

236
00:12:55,023 --> 00:12:56,814
All you need is to check that guy out.

237
00:12:57,436 --> 00:13:00,698
- Don't flex your muscles.
- You're being too lax.

238
00:13:04,071 --> 00:13:05,800
You're the best out of them all.

239
00:13:06,524 --> 00:13:07,742
You're the best out of them all.

240
00:13:07,743 --> 00:13:10,817
[She chooses Yoo Hyuk.]

241
00:13:10,818 --> 00:13:13,309
- You look very good together!
- You two match in your greens.

242
00:13:15,167 --> 00:13:18,134
- It's a couple look.
- It's a couple outfit.

243
00:13:18,135 --> 00:13:20,412
[After a closer look,
they're even dressed like a couple.]

244
00:13:20,413 --> 00:13:21,512
They're dressed like a couple today.

245
00:13:21,513 --> 00:13:24,015
<i>The new couples can now
move off to the right.</i>

246
00:13:24,016 --> 00:13:26,357
Let's see a big smile on your face, Jae Suk.

247
00:13:31,503 --> 00:13:33,764
You're starting off with six tails already.

248
00:13:33,765 --> 00:13:35,667
[A huge advantage! Soo Mi and
Jae Suk starting off with six tails.]

249
00:13:35,668 --> 00:13:39,118
If we're talking in a marriage sense,
it's like starting out with six houses.

250
00:13:39,119 --> 00:13:40,525
I'm jealous!

251
00:13:40,526 --> 00:13:43,468
- I'm so jealous.
- It's like starting out with six houses.

252
00:13:43,469 --> 00:13:45,717
We have a bigger advantage
than any other teams.

253
00:13:45,718 --> 00:13:48,882
- Yes, I'm jealous.
- We're just better than you guys.

254
00:13:48,917 --> 00:13:50,410
- Yes, you're better off right now.
- Yes, we are.

255
00:13:50,411 --> 00:13:52,932
- Next up is...
- There are two in this age group.

256
00:13:53,337 --> 00:13:56,219
<i>Park So Hyun will now make
her selection.</i>

257
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:58,984
- I don't know what to do.
- Take a look at each of us.

258
00:13:58,985 --> 00:14:00,030
Yes, go ahead and take a look at them.

259
00:14:00,031 --> 00:14:03,010
All you're doing is playing a game with
the person for a few hours today.

260
00:14:06,035 --> 00:14:09,052
- You're not choosing someone to date.
- Just take it easy and think comfortably.

261
00:14:09,053 --> 00:14:12,133
You guys all know that Park So Hyun
is starting out with four houses right now.

262
00:14:12,134 --> 00:14:13,882
[Gumiho So Hyun starting out with
an impressive number of four tails herself.]

263
00:14:13,883 --> 00:14:15,478
- Gary.
- Gary?

264
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:18,571
[Chooses Gary without any hesitation.]

265
00:14:18,572 --> 00:14:20,217
It's an honor.

266
00:14:21,469 --> 00:14:23,599
I'm staring out with four houses!

267
00:14:24,304 --> 00:14:27,269
Congratulations.
Come stand over here.

268
00:14:28,236 --> 00:14:32,134
Next up is Song Eun Ee,
who is also starting out with four tails.

269
00:14:32,135 --> 00:14:35,690
I can already see where this is headed.
I know Eun Ee very well.

270
00:14:35,691 --> 00:14:38,398
[Will it really be the man
she seemed to have chosen earlier?]

271
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:41,013
- Do we have no choice in this matter?
- Cue the music.

272
00:14:41,014 --> 00:14:44,752
La la... here I come.

273
00:14:46,247 --> 00:14:49,824
[You can guess, right?]

274
00:14:51,818 --> 00:14:53,400
There we go!

275
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:58,801
[Finally standing next to the man
she's alluded to earlier.]

276
00:15:01,843 --> 00:15:04,065
[What?
She's just passing him by?]

277
00:15:06,207 --> 00:15:09,593
[Just who will she choose?]

278
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:12,201
- I choose Ha Ha.
- Seriously?

279
00:15:12,202 --> 00:15:13,087
- Wow!
- Really?

280
00:15:13,088 --> 00:15:15,052
I was totally expecting to be picked.

281
00:15:15,053 --> 00:15:18,379
[Gumiho Eun Ee chooses Ha Ha!]

282
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:20,554
[Totally speechless.]

283
00:15:20,555 --> 00:15:22,243
You should be happy with
the four houses!

284
00:15:25,782 --> 00:15:27,058
Okay!

285
00:15:27,951 --> 00:15:30,497
- Wow, this is...
- At this rate...

286
00:15:30,712 --> 00:15:32,113
You never know who
you're going to be paired up with.

287
00:15:32,148 --> 00:15:33,383
Is Kim Suk next?

288
00:15:33,757 --> 00:15:36,747
[It's now Gumiho Kim Suk's turn
with her three tails.]

289
00:15:36,748 --> 00:15:39,918
[Is this what you call over one mountain
only to encounter another one?]

290
00:15:40,936 --> 00:15:42,449
Come on, don't do that!

291
00:15:43,883 --> 00:15:46,323
[Taking the cue to get out of the way.]

292
00:15:49,804 --> 00:15:52,305
[Praying?]

293
00:15:52,971 --> 00:15:55,248
Suk!
Suk!

294
00:15:55,249 --> 00:15:57,952
- Suk!
- Show him what you've got.

295
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,102
One, two, three!

296
00:16:12,406 --> 00:16:14,466
You better not float away from me.

297
00:16:19,385 --> 00:16:23,355
Tighten up your arms here so that
no wind blows through to carry you away.

298
00:16:24,935 --> 00:16:27,634
Jong Kook...
Jong Kook?

299
00:16:27,635 --> 00:16:29,610
- Yes?
- Just endure it for a few hours.

300
00:16:31,389 --> 00:16:33,397
Just endure it for a few hours.

301
00:16:33,398 --> 00:16:35,613
[A word of advice from the big sister...]

302
00:16:35,614 --> 00:16:39,034
Do you see how she's standing right now?
Look at how relaxed she looks.

303
00:16:39,035 --> 00:16:41,208
[Extremely relaxed pose.]

304
00:16:41,209 --> 00:16:43,599
[The ease of someone
who already has six tails.]

305
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,835
We're starting out with ease.

306
00:16:44,836 --> 00:16:46,689
Okay, it's Song Ji Hyo's turn.

307
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:49,591
[Gumiho Blank's turn with her three tails.]

308
00:16:53,964 --> 00:16:55,314
Look at how nervous they look.

309
00:16:58,009 --> 00:17:00,632
Why is this making us so nervous?

310
00:17:01,948 --> 00:17:03,903
[Please Ji Hyo...]

311
00:17:04,716 --> 00:17:07,066
[Hm...]

312
00:17:09,086 --> 00:17:10,263
Let's go.

313
00:17:11,768 --> 00:17:12,894
Let's go.

314
00:17:12,929 --> 00:17:16,008
[Blank Ji's self-sacrifice to help out
Kwang Soo in his quest for romance?]

315
00:17:16,258 --> 00:17:18,896
- What are you thinking?
- What is she thinking?

316
00:17:19,906 --> 00:17:22,037
You better realize
what an honor this is for you.

317
00:17:25,307 --> 00:17:28,266
- Look at them over there.
- Look at how happy Kwang Soo is.

318
00:17:30,964 --> 00:17:32,578
[His grin is stretched from ear to ear.]

319
00:17:34,378 --> 00:17:36,372
[There he goes again with his
farfetched romantic dreams.]

320
00:17:36,373 --> 00:17:38,942
Ri Sae... I guarantee that he's going to ask
you for your number before the show's over.

321
00:17:38,943 --> 00:17:40,775
- Don't tell him what it is.
- Come one now.

322
00:17:40,776 --> 00:17:42,751
- I don't have a cell phone.
- You don't have a cell phone?

323
00:17:42,752 --> 00:17:44,654
Why are you refusing already?

324
00:17:44,655 --> 00:17:45,942
[Strong line of defense.]

325
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:51,182
Are all the gumihos happy with

- Yes.
- Yes.

with a younger man.

- And over here is...
- An older lady with her regular kid customer.

333

her regular kid customer.

334

just met for the first time.

her attendant.

- Stalker. You're her stalker.

[Kwon Ri Sae and her stalker?]

340

- Why?
- What did she say?

342
00:18:46,377 --> 00:18:49,646
I just asked her what she thought
of these two up here.

343
00:18:49,647 --> 00:18:52,910
She said that she thinks that
he looks very sincere and honest.

344
00:18:52,911 --> 00:18:56,439
- Thank you so much.
- Then she asks me what he does for a living.

345

[Doesn't even know who
the Giraffe is.]

- No, I haven't.
- Seriously?

What is that?
There's something up there.

354

there are three rides with a mike installed.

372
00:20:22,754 --> 00:20:24,939
- Okay.
- The amusement rides to choose from are...

374
00:20:27,696 --> 00:20:30,118

375
00:20:30,119 --> 00:20:34,339
<i>And finally, the rotator teacup
over there.</i>

376
00:20:35,186 --> 00:20:37,853
<i>Find the mike that is installed on the ride
and sing the song as loud as you can</i>

377

- Really?

- Please get on the ride.

upside down on this thing.

wherever I want to?

00:29:31,886 --> 00:29:34,038
[Forgetful So Hyun not knowing
the words to the song.]

490
00:29:34,839 --> 00:29:36,700
That's not the part, So Hyun!

491
00:29:51,892 --> 00:29:54,897
Why are you singing a different song?

492
00:29:55,448 --> 00:29:57,020
What's their score?

493
00:29:59,016 --> 00:30:00,958
[Oh my...]

494
00:30:01,603 --> 00:30:03,076
29 points?

495
00:30:04,082 --> 00:30:07,107
That's just absurd!
How can it only be 29 points?

496
00:30:07,777 --> 00:30:09,848
- Let's sing something upbeat.
- okay, how about 'Night after night'?

497
00:30:09,849 --> 00:30:11,512
Night after night.

498
00:30:11,513 --> 00:30:13,149
You two look good together.

499
00:30:14,047 --> 00:30:16,126
- You two look good together.
- Really?

500
00:30:17,022 --> 00:30:19,680
[Gumiho Kim Suk in a much more uplifted
mood after hearing Jae Suk's remark.]

501
00:30:20,012 --> 00:30:21,072
Let's do this!

502
00:30:21,392 --> 00:30:24,191
[A mike hidden in the corner.]

503
00:30:27,273 --> 00:30:29,566
[On their way after having
loosened up their vocal cords.]

504
00:30:30,252 --> 00:30:31,448
Okay.

505
00:30:31,449 --> 00:30:33,995
[Their song selection- 'Night after night'.]

506
00:30:35,108 --> 00:30:37,378
[Screaming out loud from
their excitement.]

507
00:30:50,591 --> 00:30:53,702
[Screaming out loud towards the mikes.]

508
00:30:59,056 --> 00:31:00,804
Over here, over here!
The mike is over here!

509
00:31:01,704 --> 00:31:04,485
Wow... he's really good.
Must be because he's a singer.

510
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:19,093
You two look good together!

511
00:31:19,448 --> 00:31:21,543
- What did you say?
- I said, you two look good together.

512
00:31:22,763 --> 00:31:25,149
Wow... is it really possible to score
90 points on this thing?

513
00:31:27,301 --> 00:31:29,562
[Sing the song towards the mike.]

514
00:31:46,628 --> 00:31:48,028
[Singing loud and clear towards the mike.]

515
00:31:53,639 --> 00:31:55,988
Their timing is great.

516
00:31:58,322 --> 00:32:00,183
[End of the song.]

517
00:32:05,218 --> 00:32:07,965
- They really scored 95 points?
- How did they do that?

518
00:32:07,966 --> 00:32:10,395
- They seriously scored 95 points?
- The timing on the song was perfect.

519
00:32:10,396 --> 00:32:13,757
- That one part...
- The timing on that part was perfect.

520
00:32:14,226 --> 00:32:17,006
95 points indicates the chances
of the two of you working out as a couple.

521
00:32:18,273 --> 00:32:19,760
[Us two?]

522
00:32:19,761 --> 00:32:21,657
I'm a little embarrassed.

523
00:32:24,936 --> 00:32:27,688
[Kim Suk and Jong Kook heading out
with their hands clasped tightly together.]

524
00:32:29,013 --> 00:32:30,439
I can't believe that just happened.

525
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:33,119
- How did that happen?
- We must really be in sync.

526
00:32:34,972 --> 00:32:37,039
Are we the first ones to pass?

527
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:39,143
- We're the first ones to pass the mission?
- Yes, you are.

528
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:41,845
[Wins themselves a tail!]

529
00:32:43,719 --> 00:32:46,084
[Her position is a little...]

530
00:32:46,085 --> 00:32:47,741
- Here, you can put it on.
- What are you doing?

531
00:32:47,742 --> 00:32:48,833
What's wrong?

532
00:32:52,062 --> 00:32:53,202
Great job!

533
00:32:53,203 --> 00:32:56,411
- Great job!
- That frown is finally starting to go away.

534
00:32:56,783 --> 00:32:58,819
[Gumiho Suk now with four tails!]

535
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:32,271
[The perfect Idiot of Sundays expression.]

536
00:33:37,341 --> 00:33:38,389
Louder!

537
00:33:39,026 --> 00:33:43,362
[Singing 'The wrong meeting'.]

538
00:33:44,631 --> 00:33:47,866
[Just sounds like a bunch of screaming.]

539
00:34:04,779 --> 00:34:07,041
[The song finally ends.]

540
00:34:11,570 --> 00:34:13,754
- What's the score?
- 98 points!

541
00:34:13,755 --> 00:34:15,002
[What?
They actually passed?]

542
00:34:17,267 --> 00:34:19,145
How did they do that?

543
00:34:21,421 --> 00:34:22,930
- Eun Ee...
- Get down quickly.

544
00:34:22,931 --> 00:34:25,742
Yes, I'm coming down. I'm never
even going to look at that again.

545
00:34:25,743 --> 00:34:28,134
[The older lady and her regular kid customer
pass their mission!]

546
00:34:28,135 --> 00:34:30,210
- That wasn't even right.
- Good luck.

547
00:34:30,211 --> 00:34:31,933
[Envious of their success.]

548
00:34:31,934 --> 00:34:32,982
- Let's go.
- Lets go.

549
00:34:32,983 --> 00:34:34,762
The sooner you finish the mission,
the sooner you can get going.

550
00:34:34,763 --> 00:34:36,039
- Let's go.
- Let's finish this.

551
00:34:37,396 --> 00:34:39,628
[Finally gets to escape from the orbiter.]

552
00:34:40,063 --> 00:34:42,108
We passed the mission.

553
00:34:42,583 --> 00:34:44,282
- Did we win first place?
- Did we come in first?

554
00:34:44,283 --> 00:34:46,783
- Did we come in first?
- Are we the first ones to pass?

555
00:34:46,784 --> 00:34:49,190
- Kim Jong Kook came in first.
- Are you serious? Already?

556
00:34:49,191 --> 00:34:50,274
That's amazing.

557
00:34:50,275 --> 00:34:52,539
- We have five tails!
- Do you like me now?

558
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:53,707
[Gumiho Eun Ee now has five tails.]

559
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,267
Let's go!
Let's go to our next location.

560
00:34:58,471 --> 00:35:00,910
[The final tail goes to...]

561
00:35:01,746 --> 00:35:03,384
93 points!

562
00:35:03,385 --> 00:35:05,014
[Jae Suk and Soo Mi is the next couple
to pass the mission!]

563
00:35:11,518 --> 00:35:14,590
- That game was very disadvantageous for me.
- Why, So Hyun?

564
00:35:15,266 --> 00:35:18,385
She would forget the lyrics she just saw
by the time she got up to the mike.

565
00:35:18,386 --> 00:35:20,185
[Expecting forgetful So Hyun to
memorize the lyrics...]

566
00:35:20,186 --> 00:35:22,253
- So then she wouldn't sing the song at all.
- What was the score that you received?

567
00:35:22,288 --> 00:35:24,381
We scored 29 points.

568
00:35:25,402 --> 00:35:27,137

we're going to play.

jjajangmyun and jjamppong. One, two, three!

- Jjajangmyun.
- Jjajangmyun.

571
00:35:31,661 --> 00:35:33,116
Wow, they both gave the same answer.

572
00:35:33,117 --> 00:35:36,608
Kiss her!
Kiss her!

573
00:35:36,609 --> 00:35:39,428

I don't eat that stuff.
I really don't eat that stuff.

578
00:35:45,526 --> 00:35:47,388
I never eat that stuff.

579

I'm serious.
I really don't eat that stuff.

- No, he doesn't eat that stuff.
- No, he really doesn't.

581
00:35:51,274 --> 00:35:53,971
Don't be offended, Suk.
He really doesn't eat that stuff.

582
00:35:53,972 --> 00:35:56,328

- I don't eat that stuff.

584

- You know that she comes from a rich family?
- Really? Are you serious?

585

- You two have a lot in common.

588
00:36:08,995 --> 00:36:11,843
- See that?
- Why do we have so much in common!

589
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:16,243

- Where? Where from?
- From beauty pageants.

591

is saying to her in Japanese.]

- No, I was just trying to...
- What were you trying to say?

599
00:36:49,038 --> 00:36:53,361
No, it was just a line that I memorized
from a movie that I was in.

600
00:36:53,362 --> 00:36:56,132
- I remember you speaking Japanese in a movie.
- That's right, you did.

601

Yes, I remember that.

00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:11,570
It's not because Suk is heavy.

655
00:40:11,571 --> 00:40:13,684
It's because his heart is feeling heavy.

656
00:40:13,850 --> 00:40:16,062
- You know what I mean, right?
- Yes, you're right.

657
00:40:16,063 --> 00:40:17,368
He just wants to get it over with.

658
00:40:17,369 --> 00:40:19,769
And this is the first time I've seen
Jong Kook so unmotivated to win.

659
00:40:19,942 --> 00:40:21,931
This is the second time I've seen
Jong Kook being like this.

660
00:40:21,932 --> 00:40:24,190
The other time was when
Bong Sun was on the show.

661
00:40:25,346 --> 00:40:27,557
- I understand why now.
- You get it, right?

662
00:40:27,558 --> 00:40:29,369
I think I get it too.

663
00:40:29,404 --> 00:40:30,796
I really think that I get it.

664
00:40:30,797 --> 00:40:33,343
Okay, let's do this again.
This is hurting my pride a little.

665
00:40:33,344 --> 00:40:35,986
- Two people have already won.
- Everyone to the starting line.

666
00:40:35,987 --> 00:40:38,943
- My next guess is Kwang Soo.
- We have to find the right bucket.

667
00:40:39,414 --> 00:40:42,285
Let's check how many tails
each team has!

668
00:40:42,286 --> 00:40:44,155
- Two!
- Two tails. How many tails for you?

669
00:40:44,156 --> 00:40:46,166
- We currently have seven tails!
- How many tails?

670
00:40:46,167 --> 00:40:47,828
- We have four tails.
- How many tails?

671
00:40:47,829 --> 00:40:48,926
We have five tails!

672
00:40:48,927 --> 00:40:51,379
Lee Kwang Soo's team
needs to pick it up a notch.

673
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:52,769
- Attention!
- You're doing great!

674
00:40:52,770 --> 00:40:54,275
Attention!
Pay attention!

675
00:40:54,276 --> 00:40:56,566
- With your eyes straight ahead!
- You're doing great as an MC!

676
00:41:03,027 --> 00:41:04,746
[Ri Sae-Kwang Soo and Soo Mi-Jae Suk
are neck and neck.]

677
00:41:15,079 --> 00:41:17,731
[Wow! Soo Mi and Jae Suk
come in at third place!]

678
00:41:23,774 --> 00:41:26,345
- Why are you...
- Why did you guys spray it on us?

679
00:41:26,346 --> 00:41:27,768
- No, we didn't!
- You guys sprayed us with water!

680
00:41:27,769 --> 00:41:30,621
You guys really are something else.

681
00:41:30,622 --> 00:41:34,881
- Things like that can happen.
- You're acting like a rude little brat!

682
00:41:34,882 --> 00:41:37,914
Just because you're pretty,
you think you can just do whatever?

683
00:41:38,588 --> 00:41:40,512
- Calm down, Suk.
- You better watch yourself.

684
00:41:40,513 --> 00:41:42,838
I'll grab you by your hair
if you're not more careful.

685
00:41:43,976 --> 00:41:46,726
<i>As of this point,
all the tails are now gone.</i>

686
00:41:46,727 --> 00:41:49,028
- What?
- We were playing for the tail again?

687
00:41:49,029 --> 00:41:50,444
What do we do?

688
00:41:50,445 --> 00:41:54,361
<i>This time, the team that comes in last will
give up one of their tails to the winner.</i>

689
00:41:54,362 --> 00:41:57,192
[The team to come in last at this round
gives up one of their tails to the winner!]

690
00:41:57,314 --> 00:41:59,126
- This round?
- We have to win no matter what.

691
00:41:59,127 --> 00:42:01,480
- We have to make sure to win this time.
- Okay, MC!

692
00:42:02,372 --> 00:42:04,038
[MC Gae once again makes his appearance.]

693
00:42:04,039 --> 00:42:08,028
We are standing by the Han River
in Jamwon District.

694
00:42:08,751 --> 00:42:11,128
We now have two rounds left
to play in this game.

695
00:42:11,129 --> 00:42:12,731
Can you tell us how you feel right now?

696
00:42:12,732 --> 00:42:16,317
I will always remember this lady's grace,
and pay her back for it somehow!

697
00:42:16,318 --> 00:42:20,199
- Little kid, I love you!
- Then two more helpings of the blood sausage!

698
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:22,071
- Okay, fighting!
- Fighting.

699
00:42:22,072 --> 00:42:24,575
We are now meeting with a couple
who's love is just starting to bud.

700
00:42:24,576 --> 00:42:27,025
How do you feel right at this moment?

701
00:42:27,330 --> 00:42:28,889
[Punishing the stalker?]

702
00:42:28,890 --> 00:42:30,367
What are you doing?
Stop it!

703
00:42:30,368 --> 00:42:31,587
Don't do it!

704
00:42:31,588 --> 00:42:33,996
What about Lee Kwang Soo
do you find attractive?

705
00:42:34,031 --> 00:42:35,290
Excuse me?

706
00:42:35,291 --> 00:42:37,306
- What did you say?
- Okay, let's move on.

707
00:42:37,307 --> 00:42:40,149
[A clean cut-off over to the next team.]

708
00:42:40,150 --> 00:42:44,331
- Team Kim Jong Kook and Kim Suk. How are you?
- I don't think he's putting in the effort.

709
00:42:44,332 --> 00:42:46,260
- I'm very discontent.
- Why aren't you putting in the effort?

710
00:42:46,261 --> 00:42:47,712
I'm not in my best condition today.

711
00:42:47,712 --> 00:42:51,054
Why is it that you're in a bad condition
whenever Bong Sun and I come out on the show?

712
00:42:51,504 --> 00:42:53,218
Attention!

713
00:42:53,219 --> 00:42:54,787
- Attention.
- MC Gary.

714
00:42:54,788 --> 00:42:56,377
- Attention.
- You're doing great!

715
00:42:57,161 --> 00:42:58,445
- You're a great MC.
- MC Gary.

716
00:42:59,142 --> 00:43:00,884
No cheating.
No cheating!

717
00:43:01,518 --> 00:43:03,738
- MC, fighting.
-  Sportsmanship.

718
00:43:03,739 --> 00:43:05,822
- Check your mike one time.
- Yes.

719
00:43:12,883 --> 00:43:15,113
[The team that comes in last in this round
will have to give up one of their tails!]

720
00:43:16,728 --> 00:43:18,980
[More focused on revenge
rather than winning.]

721
00:43:24,446 --> 00:43:26,528
[Eun Ee, Ha Ha and Gary, Ri Sae
makes it back to the starting line!]

722
00:43:27,592 --> 00:43:29,708
[Suk and Jong Kook comes in last.]

723
00:43:30,399 --> 00:43:32,268
This is so much fun!

724
00:43:32,806 --> 00:43:34,692
This is so fun.

725
00:43:35,652 --> 00:43:38,243
- What are you doing?
- Don't you think that this is too much?

726
00:43:38,244 --> 00:43:40,951
- How am I being too much?
- I'm getting my revenge if you keep this up.

727
00:43:40,951 --> 00:43:43,817
- I'm going to marry you if you keep this up.
- It's not that bad!

728
00:43:43,818 --> 00:43:46,317
- You're seriously being too much.
- That's a scary revenge.

729
00:43:46,318 --> 00:43:48,541
- What have I done that's so bad?
- That's too severe of a revenge.

730
00:43:49,038 --> 00:43:51,350
- That's too harsh.
- Suk loses one of her tails, right?

731
00:43:51,351 --> 00:43:53,022
- Yes.
- Do I just take one off of her?

732
00:43:54,107 --> 00:43:58,076
[So Hyun and Gary takes one of Suk's tails
for having come on at first place.]

733
00:43:59,189 --> 00:44:01,420
Now I'm left feeling kind of bad
for Jong Kook.

734
00:44:01,421 --> 00:44:02,677
Please excuse me while I do this.

735
00:44:08,213 --> 00:44:10,172
Hang on.
Hang on a second, So Hyun.

736
00:44:11,283 --> 00:44:13,394
I know how that must feel,
but you need to hold still for a minute.

737
00:44:13,799 --> 00:44:15,252
Okay, all set.

738
00:44:15,253 --> 00:44:17,561
[So Hyun and Gary's tail count
is now up to five.]

739
00:44:17,562 --> 00:44:19,621
- And the team that came in second...
- You have more?

740
00:44:20,842 --> 00:44:26,088
[The second and third place team
also gets a tail.]

741
00:44:26,089 --> 00:44:28,438
Palmiho!
(Meaning eight tailed fox)

742
00:44:28,786 --> 00:44:30,864
- Palmiho?
- So you just need one more?

743
00:44:31,786 --> 00:44:34,563
- How did that happen?
- We all have to join our forces together.

744
00:44:34,564 --> 00:44:36,521
- He's right.
- We have to work together.

745
00:44:36,522 --> 00:44:38,643
We all have to join our forces together.

746
00:44:38,644 --> 00:44:39,787
Join our forces together.

747
00:44:39,788 --> 00:44:42,120
[Join their forces together?]

748
00:44:43,305 --> 00:44:47,711
[Next week... the moment where they truly
will have to join their forces will arrive.]

749
00:44:47,712 --> 00:44:50,354
Eliminate each other's name tags to
be the last one left remaining.

750
00:44:51,574 --> 00:44:54,279
[Superhuman superpowers.]

751
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:56,604
[At last, all the superheroes are
gathered together in one place.]

752
00:44:56,605 --> 00:44:59,755
- Hulk!
- Ironman! I'm the Ironman!

753
00:45:00,121 --> 00:45:02,123
[The battle of the superheroes.]

754
00:45:02,124 --> 00:45:04,239
[Will they join their forces together?]

755
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:06,883
[Or will they battle each other
to stand as the best amongst the group?]

756
00:45:07,828 --> 00:45:10,106
[Next week's Running Man-
Running Man Avengers.]

757
00:45:10,629 --> 00:45:12,764
[9999 bus heads off to their next location.]

758
00:45:12,765 --> 00:45:14,753
- Did you enjoy your second mission?
- Yes.

759
00:45:14,754 --> 00:45:17,720
I actually feel a little nervous
about having too many tails.

760
00:45:18,109 --> 00:45:20,223
What if we get them all stolen from us
at the end in an elimination race?

761
00:45:20,224 --> 00:45:21,637
- I'm sure you will.
- I'm sure that's what we're doing.

762
00:45:21,638 --> 00:45:23,746
- I'm sure that's what'll happen.
- Ones with a lot of tails will be targeted.

763
00:45:23,747 --> 00:45:26,984
Wait, don't you guys only need
one more to get all your tails?

764
00:45:26,985 --> 00:45:28,917
- We're a palmiho.
- We have to stop them.

765
00:45:28,918 --> 00:45:30,107
- We really do have to stop them.
- Yes, we have to stop them.

766
00:45:30,108 --> 00:45:31,857
We only have two tails.

767
00:45:32,359 --> 00:45:37,547
My elbow here is like a hammer.
I'm going to knock you all away with this.

768
00:45:38,553 --> 00:45:41,135
[Don't even come near my tails!
I'll knock you out with my elbow!]

769
00:45:41,136 --> 00:45:42,992
- You're scaring me.
- With your elbow?

770
00:45:42,993 --> 00:45:46,262
It hurts even more because
there's no flesh over my elbow bone.

771
00:45:46,263 --> 00:45:48,569
Want to see how it feels?
It really hurts.

772
00:45:48,570 --> 00:45:51,340
[A frightening declaration of war.]

773
00:45:51,341 --> 00:45:54,743
She made a clear declaration of war.
She said she'll knock you all out.

774
00:45:54,744 --> 00:45:56,936
- I'm going to knock you out like this.
- Her elbow.

775
00:45:57,423 --> 00:46:00,121
- Isn't Gary a Chilmiho? (Seven)
- No, we're a Yookmiho. (Six)

776
00:46:00,122 --> 00:46:01,456
Yookmiho?

777
00:46:01,457 --> 00:46:02,974
- Then are you Ohmiho?
- Ohmiho.

778
00:46:02,975 --> 00:46:04,366
- What about you?
- Sammiho. (Three)

779
00:46:04,367 --> 00:46:06,928
- I'm sorry, honey.
- She just said, 'I'm sorry, honey'!

780
00:46:06,929 --> 00:46:09,842
- She's apologizing to him.
- What are you so sorry to him about?

781
00:46:10,317 --> 00:46:12,746
- What about your team?
- We're a Samiho.

782
00:46:13,186 --> 00:46:15,016
- We're Eemiho.
- Eemiho?

783
00:46:15,017 --> 00:46:16,541
Stop focusing on dating then,
and focus more on the work at hand.

784
00:46:16,542 --> 00:46:18,641
- Concentrate more on work.
- Stop focusing everything on romance.

785
00:46:18,642 --> 00:46:21,016
- How many tails do I have?
- Six.

786
00:46:21,017 --> 00:46:24,336
- I have six?
- Please try to remember things!

787
00:46:24,337 --> 00:46:26,086
- Please, So Hyun!
- Why? What is it?

788
00:46:26,372 --> 00:46:27,606
She can't remember anything!

789
00:46:27,607 --> 00:46:29,673
I've already had to remind her three times
that we have six tails.

790

[Forgetful So Hyun forgetting things
in the blink of an eye.]

791

- Yookmiho!
- Yookmiho.

792
00:46:36,552 --> 00:46:38,486
She's unexpectedly high maintenance.

793
00:46:38,487 --> 00:46:39,841
[Forgetful So Hyun turning out
to be pretty high maintenance.]

794

[Gumihos enter the restaurant first?]

798
00:46:50,235 --> 00:46:51,962
The table isn't even set.

799
00:46:52,486 --> 00:46:55,424
If it's a game about eating fast, then I'll be
the first one to finish and get out of here.

800
00:46:55,817 --> 00:46:59,416
[What's the mission that awaits
them here at the restaurant?]

801
00:47:02,924 --> 00:47:04,968
- Hello.
- Yes, hello.

802
00:47:11,034 --> 00:47:13,507
- Have you decided what you want to order?
- No, I haven't decided yet.

803
00:47:13,508 --> 00:47:14,950
Do I just tell her what I want to order?

804
00:47:14,951 --> 00:47:16,866
- Yes, make your food selection.
- Okay.

805

[What kind of meat should I
order for my wraps?]

806
00:47:23,815 --> 00:47:25,569

over to Blank Ji as well.]

[Let's just eat for now.]

809
00:47:35,425 --> 00:47:37,232
- The top sirloin.
- Okay.

810
00:47:37,874 --> 00:47:39,246
Is it a speed eating contest?

811
00:47:39,247 --> 00:47:41,504
I'm really confident I can
win that one.

812
00:47:41,812 --> 00:47:44,549
I ate a lot this morning at breakfast
so my stomach is already stretched out.

813
00:47:45,492 --> 00:47:47,908
You can just choose whatever you
want to eat from the menu.

814
00:47:47,909 --> 00:47:49,781
[Happiness from having seen the menu.]

815
00:47:50,206 --> 00:47:52,194
- I'm going to eat a lot of meat.
- But this is kind of making me nervous.

816
00:47:52,195 --> 00:47:54,655
- Why?
- I feel like they're up to something.

817
00:47:54,973 --> 00:47:56,715
What is this?

818
00:47:57,428 --> 00:47:59,892
- Come over here.
- We don't know what the mission is yet.

819
00:47:59,893 --> 00:48:01,215
You still don't know?

820
00:48:01,216 --> 00:48:02,322
Then what is this?

821
00:48:02,322 --> 00:48:04,420
They told us to order something,
so I ordered something from the menu.

822
00:48:06,373 --> 00:48:11,332
[A lettuce wrap for the man who's
been put under their spell.]

823
00:48:18,272 --> 00:48:21,577
Stop complaining and just eat it.

824
00:48:22,983 --> 00:48:27,496
[Time to reveal the next mission.]

825
00:48:27,969 --> 00:48:29,791
<i>When you were ordering off the menu...</i>

826
00:48:30,404 --> 00:48:32,731
<i>remember the order in which the
waitress put down the side dishes</i>

827
00:48:32,732 --> 00:48:36,392
<i>and make a lettuce wrap with that dish to
feed it to your men in the same order.</i>

828
00:48:36,393 --> 00:48:38,063
- What?
- Huh?

829
00:48:38,063 --> 00:48:39,543
<i>Do you understand the game?</i>

830
00:48:39,544 --> 00:48:43,265
[Lettuce wrap eating contest
according to your gumiho's memory skills.]

831
00:48:44,355 --> 00:48:51,708
[Do you remember this contest which became
the topic of conversation two summers ago?]

832
00:48:51,709 --> 00:48:54,314
Then that gives Ji Hyo the advantage.

833
00:48:54,315 --> 00:48:58,487
No, because I was looking at the menu
when she was setting the table.

834
00:48:59,388 --> 00:49:02,877
[A mission that the gumihos couldn't
even have fathomed a guess at.]

835
00:49:02,878 --> 00:49:04,451
How can you not remember a single thing!

836
00:49:05,486 --> 00:49:07,918
I can't remember the first and the last
dish that she set down whatsoever.

837
00:49:07,919 --> 00:49:11,463
- Let's just hurry up and do this.
- This isn't even right.

838
00:49:12,251 --> 00:49:15,247
Wow, this is unbelievable.
This is very sneaky.

839
00:49:15,248 --> 00:49:18,095
She says she doesn't remember at all.

840
00:49:18,722 --> 00:49:21,789
She says she was looking at the menu
when the food was brought in.

841
00:49:21,790 --> 00:49:24,573
Ri Sae just lied to me and told me that
the table was already set when she came in.

842
00:49:25,533 --> 00:49:27,478
No, it really was.

843
00:49:27,479 --> 00:49:29,283
How are we going to do this?

844
00:49:30,723 --> 00:49:36,914
[Correct answer- Kimchi, lettuce wrap sauce,
perelli leaves, seaweed, anchovy, garlic...]

845
00:49:36,915 --> 00:49:45,030
[eggplant, peppers, quail eggs,
soybean paste soup, rice.]

846
00:49:46,381 --> 00:49:49,540
- In the order it was placed on the table?
- The order it was placed on the table?

847
00:49:49,541 --> 00:49:52,151
- I have no idea what she did.
- Do you know what she laid down first?

848
00:49:53,618 --> 00:49:56,130
I'm pretty sure the table was already set.
Was it not?

849
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:57,985
Are you going to keep lying?

850
00:49:57,986 --> 00:50:01,106
I remember walking in here and thinking
how delicious everything was going to be.

851
00:50:01,107 --> 00:50:03,240
All I could think about at the time was
getting my silverware.

852
00:50:03,241 --> 00:50:04,681
Because I was just so eager to eat.

853
00:50:04,682 --> 00:50:06,137
We're ruined.

854
00:50:07,661 --> 00:50:11,676
[A tough mission where they will
have to keep trying until they succeed.]

855
00:50:11,677 --> 00:50:13,235
We have to do it in order.

856
00:50:13,236 --> 00:50:17,536
[Hang on...]

857
00:50:17,537 --> 00:50:20,630
[I saw the kimchi first!]

858
00:50:24,023 --> 00:50:27,088
[Then I stopped paying attention because
I was looking at the menu.]

859
00:50:27,089 --> 00:50:29,019
Okay, I'm going to give it a try.

860
00:50:29,020 --> 00:50:33,203
[Going off her memory and
wrapping up the kimchi first.]

861
00:50:33,204 --> 00:50:35,509
Watch her reaction.
See? This is right.

862
00:50:37,762 --> 00:50:40,921
- I don't know if rice was next.
- Look at her reaction.

863
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:49,948
She just turned her head.
The waitress just turned her head.

864
00:50:50,523 --> 00:50:52,042
Was that the first thing?

865
00:50:55,742 --> 00:50:58,392
I bet this was next.
I'm sure these were the first ones placed.

866
00:50:58,393 --> 00:51:00,338
This one next?
How about this one?

867
00:51:00,339 --> 00:51:02,203
Then this one?

868
00:51:02,204 --> 00:51:06,090
[Right or wrong,
let's enjoy the meal first.]

869
00:51:06,091 --> 00:51:10,262
- How many did they get right?
- They got the lettuce and the next one right.

870
00:51:11,884 --> 00:51:14,581
[A nice start thanks to Eun Ee's memory.]

871
00:51:21,741 --> 00:51:23,769
They got up to the
second ingredient right.

872
00:51:24,369 --> 00:51:27,291
[Ri Sae and Kwang Soo get lucky
and gets the kimchi correct.]

873
00:51:27,593 --> 00:51:29,823
- Nice to see you.
- Is it good?

874
00:51:29,824 --> 00:51:34,023
Let's work together to get on
to the next round together.

875
00:51:36,825 --> 00:51:39,522
[Is she trying to cheat?]

876
00:51:40,791 --> 00:51:44,934
- You're being so blatant.
- She's just stretching out her achy legs.

877
00:51:44,935 --> 00:51:46,539
Do you want to get beat?

878
00:51:46,883 --> 00:51:48,521
Do you want to get beat?

879
00:51:49,579 --> 00:51:51,471
Please stop being so blatant.

880
00:51:52,931 --> 00:51:55,495
- Let's try to remember what we did.
- I know.

881
00:51:55,980 --> 00:51:57,716
We have to remember what we did.

882
00:51:58,357 --> 00:52:00,520
This one?
Oh, I forgot this one.

883
00:52:01,219 --> 00:52:02,701
I forgot to put this one in.
This one here.

884
00:52:02,702 --> 00:52:05,683
You didn't put that one in?
I guess we left it out.

885
00:52:05,684 --> 00:52:08,269
Okay, how about this?
I can't remember what the order was.

886
00:52:08,270 --> 00:52:10,453
[Having gotten the whole order wrong
with the exception of one ingredient.]

887
00:52:10,454 --> 00:52:12,901
- Did you put the meat in?
- Sorry, I forgot the meat.

888
00:52:15,026 --> 00:52:16,846
- Sorry.
- You didn't put the meat in?

889
00:52:16,847 --> 00:52:18,421
I really am sorry.

890
00:52:18,775 --> 00:52:22,287
[He's putting that whole thing
in his mouth?]

891
00:52:22,288 --> 00:52:24,331
[But they still get it wrong.]

892
00:52:24,921 --> 00:52:28,939
Can't you just tell us what it is?
We'll tell you guys if we get it right too.

893
00:52:28,940 --> 00:52:30,793
- The first one?
- Just tell us what the first one is.

894
00:52:30,794 --> 00:52:32,993
No, we can't.
We have to figure it out ourselves first.

895
00:52:32,994 --> 00:52:35,623
- We'll tell you what the first ingredient is.
- Okay, we're not going to get this anyways.

896
00:52:35,624 --> 00:52:36,752
- Lettuce.
- What?

897
00:52:36,753 --> 00:52:39,036
- First thing is lettuce.
- That's a given.

898
00:52:39,635 --> 00:52:41,976
So Hyun is getting mad.
Can't you just tell us?

899
00:52:41,977 --> 00:52:45,796
Just tell us what the first one is
so that we can be in the game too.

900
00:52:45,797 --> 00:52:47,360
Why are you getting angry?

901
00:52:47,361 --> 00:52:50,833
- I can't remember anything right now.
- None of us remember.

902
00:52:50,834 --> 00:52:52,214
The only thing I can remember is...

903
00:52:52,573 --> 00:52:56,252
this thing being placed in front of me
and I grabbed a spoon to take a bite.

904
00:52:57,146 --> 00:52:59,722
So what I mean is,
I think this thing came last.

905
00:53:00,061 --> 00:53:02,860
Because this was placed in the end in
front of me for me to open the lid for a bite.

906
00:53:02,861 --> 00:53:04,686
That makes sense.

907
00:53:04,687 --> 00:53:06,814
So I'm pretty sure that this
one came last.

908
00:53:07,258 --> 00:53:11,522
Eun Ee, the feeling I get is that
this thing definitely isn't next.

909
00:53:11,523 --> 00:53:13,252
There's no other choice but for you to
have to eat a lot right now.

910
00:53:13,253 --> 00:53:14,479
- Okay.
- Right?

911
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:16,819
- Except for the one we know...
- Put this one in.

912
00:53:16,820 --> 00:53:17,933
This one.

913
00:53:17,934 --> 00:53:19,523
Perelli leaves?

914
00:53:20,538 --> 00:53:23,344
The rest isn't as important.
The rest is all about freestyle.

915
00:53:23,345 --> 00:53:24,966
We have no other choice
but to guess at the rest.

916
00:53:25,752 --> 00:53:28,091
- Wrong.
- You got up to the fourth ingredient right.

917
00:53:28,092 --> 00:53:30,000
[They got it right up to the perelli leaves!]

918
00:53:30,001 --> 00:53:32,109
- Let's try to go from here.
- Lets share what we've got.

919
00:53:32,479 --> 00:53:34,414
- What?
- I'm sorry, but we don't want to do that.

920
00:53:35,128 --> 00:53:36,670
Sorry.

921
00:53:38,722 --> 00:53:41,717
[Gumiho Soo Mi's attempt at
making the lettuce wrap.]

922
00:53:57,760 --> 00:53:59,410
Who are you staring at as
you're doing this?

923
00:53:59,411 --> 00:54:01,242
I'm just looking up at the wall.

924
00:54:02,213 --> 00:54:03,830
I'm just staring up at the wall.

925
00:54:08,988 --> 00:54:10,800
It's already wrong?

926
00:54:11,335 --> 00:54:13,185
You're telling us we've got it
wrong already?

927
00:54:15,046 --> 00:54:17,267
- We already know that much.
- You'd better be careful.

928
00:54:17,268 --> 00:54:20,512
- Why?
- Kwang Soo's watching what you're doing.

929
00:54:20,513 --> 00:54:22,398
We already know up to that point.

930
00:54:22,399 --> 00:54:25,336
- But he can learn something he doesn't know.
- If you keep peeking like that...

931
00:54:25,337 --> 00:54:27,455
you may get knocked out with her elbow.

932
00:54:29,004 --> 00:54:33,512
[You haven't forgotten, have you?
Her sharp elbow jab?]

933
00:54:34,275 --> 00:54:37,035
Let's just share with everyone
what the first ingredient is.

934
00:54:37,035 --> 00:54:38,635
What's the first ingredient?

935
00:54:38,636 --> 00:54:41,394
Wouldn't it be much better for everyone if
we at least get the first ingredient right?

936
00:54:41,395 --> 00:54:43,381
Okay, let's do that.
Then what's the first ingredient?

937
00:54:43,382 --> 00:54:45,495
We can't tell you what
the first ingredient is.

938
00:54:45,496 --> 00:54:48,320
- No, we can't tell you that.
- We'll tell you what the third one is.

939
00:54:48,321 --> 00:54:50,758
If you tell us what the first one is,
we'll tell you what the third one is.

940
00:54:50,759 --> 00:54:53,166
Okay, and we'll tell you
what the sixth one is.

941
00:54:53,167 --> 00:54:54,491
Okay, tell us.

942
00:54:54,973 --> 00:54:58,031
If we tell you what the first one is,
then tell us what the third and sixth one is.

943
00:54:58,032 --> 00:55:00,691
- Okay, since we have to get the game going.
- Lets just do it.

944
00:55:00,692 --> 00:55:02,627
[The three teams in this room are
attempting to share their information.]

945
00:55:02,628 --> 00:55:04,430
- Then tell us what the first one is.
- You tell us yours first.

946
00:55:04,431 --> 00:55:06,587
Okay, we'll tell you the first one.
The first one is kimchi.

947
00:55:07,014 --> 00:55:09,452
Ah... that was the one.
We could've gotten that one.

948
00:55:09,453 --> 00:55:10,779
- Third one is perelli leaves.
- What's next?

949
00:55:10,780 --> 00:55:13,911
- The sixth one is garlic.
- Okay, sixth one is garlic.

950
00:55:14,985 --> 00:55:16,290
And also...

951
00:55:16,291 --> 00:55:20,155
Who puts in kimchi first
when they make lettuce wraps?

952
00:55:20,156 --> 00:55:21,659
[Finding it shocking that kimchi is
the first ingredient in a lettuce wrap?]

953
00:55:21,660 --> 00:55:25,904
[That's because it's up to the lady
who set down the side dishes on the table.]

954
00:55:30,260 --> 00:55:33,103
[Wrong- The second ingredient is the sauce.]

955
00:55:38,234 --> 00:55:40,037
How did they get the garlic right?

956
00:55:41,576 --> 00:55:42,810
How many ingredients is that
for them so far?

957
00:55:42,811 --> 00:55:44,485
Put this one in?

958
00:55:47,961 --> 00:55:50,848
[Wow!]

959
00:55:55,957 --> 00:55:58,969
[She just guessed but gets it right!]

960
00:56:02,152 --> 00:56:03,725
They're really getting it right?

961
00:56:06,749 --> 00:56:10,697
[Will they get it right?]

962
00:56:19,378 --> 00:56:22,857
[Suk and Jong Kook seeming
to have it figured out.]

963
00:56:22,858 --> 00:56:24,329
How many did you guys get right?

964
00:56:26,906 --> 00:56:28,198
I bet it's this one.

965
00:56:28,199 --> 00:56:33,474
[All the other teams are still in the
process of throwing out wild guesses.]

966
00:56:33,475 --> 00:56:38,897
[But thanks to their wrong guesses,
they're eating until their bellies are full!]

967
00:56:41,629 --> 00:56:43,831
Can't you just let Soo Mi eat in peace?

968
00:56:47,014 --> 00:56:48,480
We got it.
Let's finish it this time around!

969
00:56:48,481 --> 00:56:49,672
Let's finish it.

970
00:56:51,129 --> 00:56:52,938
If we can get it right this time,
it'll be a pure miracle.

971
00:56:57,886 --> 00:57:00,827
We just ran out of kimchi,
and this is our last piece.

972
00:57:00,828 --> 00:57:02,269
[Making a clean sweep through the board.]

973
00:57:04,716 --> 00:57:06,290
That also was our last piece.

974
00:57:06,291 --> 00:57:08,345
How is it all working out perfectly
with the last bits of food?

975
00:57:08,346 --> 00:57:09,767
Just put one in!

976
00:57:09,768 --> 00:57:11,951
[She puts in all the
remaining cloves of the garlic!]

977
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:14,462
Are you crazy?

978
00:57:14,463 --> 00:57:15,973
That's enough.

979
00:57:16,259 --> 00:57:18,701
[All the remaining pieces of the hot pepper!]

980
00:57:22,257 --> 00:57:24,805
[And no more of the quail eggs either!]

981
00:57:26,141 --> 00:57:28,368
<i>You have to eat as
your gumiho tells you to eat.</i>

982
00:57:28,369 --> 00:57:30,102
Okay.

983
00:57:32,323 --> 00:57:34,091
Don't do that!

984
00:57:34,092 --> 00:57:36,368
[It's the gumiho's choice.]

985
00:57:36,369 --> 00:57:38,020
That's not even right!

986
00:57:38,021 --> 00:57:39,889
No matter how happy you are about that,
that's still not right.

987
00:57:41,279 --> 00:57:43,875
[Open up your mouth!]

988
00:57:44,822 --> 00:57:46,109
Are you crazy?

989
00:57:46,110 --> 00:57:48,842
Let's take some of that out.
I can't eat it like that.

990
00:57:48,843 --> 00:57:50,191
She must've made a very big bite.

991
00:57:50,192 --> 00:57:51,797
She wrapped everything?

992
00:57:55,823 --> 00:57:58,813
[Suk and Jong Kook wins
the memory lettuce wrap mission!]

993
00:57:58,814 --> 00:58:01,714
[Mixing up all the dishes
so the others can't see.]

994
00:58:05,334 --> 00:58:09,581
[Thanks to all the food in their mouths,
they're being kept nice and quiet.]

995
00:58:10,679 --> 00:58:12,407
You really won?

996
00:58:13,878 --> 00:58:14,922
How did you guys get it right?

997
00:58:14,923 --> 00:58:16,604
Your belly is sticking out, Suk.
Stick it back in.

998
00:58:17,377 --> 00:58:20,142
She didn't even know that her belly was
sticking out because she was so excited.

999
00:58:20,143 --> 00:58:21,300
[How did they get it right?]

1000
00:58:22,157 --> 00:58:27,089
[And the heat of the garlic and the pepper
finally hitting Jong Kook's taste buds.]

1001
00:58:28,708 --> 00:58:31,681
[Soon thereafter,
So Hyun and Gary gets it right.]

1002
00:58:31,682 --> 00:58:35,713
[Ji Hyo and Suk Jin come in third.]

1003
00:58:44,228 --> 00:58:46,714
[The gumiho bus hits the road once again.]

1004
00:58:46,715 --> 00:58:49,909
<i>This brings Kim Jong Kook and Kim Suk's
tail count up to four.</i>

1005
00:58:50,420 --> 00:58:56,379
[First, second, and third place winners of
the lettuce wrap game wins a tail!]

1006
00:58:56,380 --> 00:58:57,411
Really?

1007
00:58:58,754 --> 00:59:00,623
You really have to be careful
about the woman you meet.

1008
00:59:00,624 --> 00:59:03,431
After the meal we had after that game,
I'm still really full.

1009
00:59:03,745 --> 00:59:05,751
You started out with all those tails anyways.

1010
00:59:05,752 --> 00:59:09,351
- You still  have the most number of tails.
- Just know that the elbow is coming out.

1011
00:59:09,352 --> 00:59:12,161
[The elbow will soon start flying!]

1012
00:59:12,162 --> 00:59:13,256
The most important thing is

1013
00:59:13,291 --> 00:59:16,350
if we can't touch Soo Mi,
it's all going to come to you.

1014
00:59:16,351 --> 00:59:19,251
But still keep in mind that
she's the one with the tails.

1015
00:59:19,252 --> 00:59:22,506
And just to let you know,
she's been sharpening up her elbow.

1016
00:59:22,507 --> 00:59:26,643
[She's been sharpening up her elbow
in the meantime?]

1017
00:59:27,367 --> 00:59:29,727
- Are we here?
- The bus is turning in here.

1018
00:59:30,420 --> 00:59:32,509
It's the national folk museum.

1019
00:59:32,510 --> 00:59:34,444
- It's so beautiful.
- I love places like this.

1020
00:59:34,445 --> 00:59:39,609
[The final location-
National folk museum in Kyungbok Palace.]

1021
00:59:47,863 --> 00:59:52,852
[A national folk museum
inside of Kyungbok Palace.]

1022
00:59:52,853 --> 00:59:57,635
[Still the same as what
the country used to look like.]

1023
00:59:58,356 --> 01:00:01,254
[What is the mission that awaits
the gumihos in here?]

1024
01:00:04,868 --> 01:00:08,673
[Entering the museum with the
tails that they've earned thus far.]

1025
01:00:08,898 --> 01:00:13,397
- With all these tails we have...
- I feel better since we have a few tails.

1026
01:00:13,398 --> 01:00:15,530
It makes you feel more secure, right?

1027
01:00:15,531 --> 01:00:19,754
<i>Great job on having made it
to your final destination.</i>

1028
01:00:20,126 --> 01:00:23,446
<i>Since a gumiho needs to have
nine tails in order to ascend...</i>

1029
01:00:23,614 --> 01:00:27,422
<i>the gumihos need to eliminate the
other gumiho's name tags</i>

1030
01:00:27,423 --> 01:00:30,672
<i>in order to gain more tails
for themselves.</i>

1031
01:00:31,431 --> 01:00:34,242
<i>We have to eliminate other
gumihos' name tags?</i>

1032
01:00:34,243 --> 01:00:35,665
<i>Every time a gumiho eliminates another
gumiho's name tag</i>

1033
01:00:35,666 --> 01:00:38,415
<i>they earn themselves another tail.</i>

1034
01:00:39,775 --> 01:00:43,788
<i>However, if a man gets his name tag eliminated
by another gumiho other than their partner</i>

1035
01:00:43,789 --> 01:00:46,485
<i>that man becomes entranced by
the gumiho who eliminates their name tag</i>

1036
01:00:46,486 --> 01:00:50,565
<i>and thus becomes a man of
the new gumiho.</i>

1037
01:00:51,584 --> 01:00:55,464
If I eliminate another gumiho,
then I win their tails?

1038
01:00:55,465 --> 01:00:59,936
If you eliminate another man's name tag,
that man will become our teammate.

1039
01:01:00,653 --> 01:01:02,471
- Oh my.
- Oh my.

1040
01:01:02,917 --> 01:01:06,809
<i>We will now start our final mission.</i>

1041
01:01:07,618 --> 01:01:13,334
<i>Five, four, three...</i>

1042
01:01:13,335 --> 01:01:15,373
So I just eliminate whomever I can?

1043
01:01:15,803 --> 01:01:21,290
<i>Three, two, one.
Start!</i>

1044
01:01:21,291 --> 01:01:23,789
You just need to eliminate
one gumiho for us to win.

1045
01:01:23,790 --> 01:01:26,930
I have to make sure not to lose
any one of my tails.

1046
01:01:27,645 --> 01:01:29,445
Let's eliminate one of the men first.

1047
01:01:29,446 --> 01:01:30,782
But why are you doing this
with your hands?

1048
01:01:30,783 --> 01:01:33,665
- Just... just because.
- Just because?

1049
01:01:33,666 --> 01:01:35,907
- Trying to be cute?
- Yeah, I'm just trying to be cute.

1050
01:01:36,202 --> 01:01:37,790
Why?
Don't I look like a cute gumiho?

1051
01:01:37,791 --> 01:01:39,968
- I'll grab one for you to eliminate.
- Yeah, you grab someone and I will.

1052
01:01:39,969 --> 01:01:43,717
- I can do that, but I think...
- But I feel uncomfortable eliminating Soo Mi.

1053
01:01:44,435 --> 01:01:45,810
Because of her elbow?

1054
01:01:45,811 --> 01:01:50,761
My elbow is a total killer.
I can take someone out with this.

1055
01:01:50,762 --> 01:01:53,725
[Declaration of war]

1056
01:01:54,291 --> 01:01:57,112
[I'm going to take everyone out with this.]

1057
01:01:57,113 --> 01:01:58,406
- With my elbow.
- Watch out for her elbow.

1058
01:01:59,342 --> 01:02:03,963
[The last gumiho left remaining will win
no matter how many tails she has.]

1059
01:02:04,359 --> 01:02:10,620
[Who will be the gumiho that
will the battle?]

1060
01:02:10,621 --> 01:02:12,370
We don't even need to think about it.

1061
01:02:12,371 --> 01:02:14,967
We just need to get out there
and target Soo Mi.

1062
01:02:16,029 --> 01:02:18,241
- Let's not eliminate each other.
- Okay.

1063
01:02:18,242 --> 01:02:20,103
- Let's help each other out.
- Okay.

1064
01:02:20,104 --> 01:02:21,911
We'll make sure that you win today.

1065
01:02:23,869 --> 01:02:25,768
- There she comes. Suk!
- Who?

1066
01:02:29,477 --> 01:02:32,438
[A surprise attack!]

1067
01:02:32,439 --> 01:02:34,134
You're pretty quick!

1068
01:02:35,237 --> 01:02:38,049
[They may get eliminated right away
if they let down their guard at all.]

1069
01:02:39,171 --> 01:02:41,361
[Discovers Jae Suk and Soo Mi
with their eight tails.]

1070
01:02:41,362 --> 01:02:44,893
- We need to attack Jae Suk. Hurry.
- We only have two tails.

1071
01:02:44,894 --> 01:02:47,190
I know, so hurry. Are you
going to help us catch them or not?

1072
01:02:47,191 --> 01:02:49,453
Do you know how strong Eun Ee is?

1073
01:02:49,835 --> 01:02:52,296
I'm not strong.
I don't know how to do any of this.

1074
01:02:52,972 --> 01:02:55,042
Jae Suk is over there staring
at us right now.

1075
01:02:55,043 --> 01:02:56,827
Soo Mi is headed this way.

1076
01:02:56,828 --> 01:03:01,286
[Elbow gumiho Soo Mi makes
her entrance.]

1077
01:03:04,789 --> 01:03:08,751
[No... I'd better eliminate Ri Sae first.]

1078
01:03:13,474 --> 01:03:17,259
[All of a sudden, it's Ri Sae and Kwang Soo
vs. Eun Ee and Ha Ha!]

1079
01:03:17,999 --> 01:03:19,911
We have to seize this chance
to eliminate one of them.

1080
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:23,955
[Kwang Soo attempting to protect Ri Sae
by holding onto her name tag.]

1081
01:03:25,215 --> 01:03:26,932
Ri Sae!
No!

1082
01:03:33,008 --> 01:03:34,267
No!

1083
01:03:34,611 --> 01:03:36,008
Ri Sae!

1084
01:03:38,677 --> 01:03:40,600
No, Kwang Soo!
You can't leave me!

1085
01:03:41,895 --> 01:03:44,594
[Ri Sae...]

1086
01:03:47,572 --> 01:03:50,212
[Gumiho Ri Sae having lost her guardian...]

1087
01:03:50,213 --> 01:03:51,735
Ri Sae.

1088
01:03:51,736 --> 01:03:54,126
We've all failed.

1089
01:03:54,127 --> 01:03:55,842
Don't run from us.

1090
01:03:56,191 --> 01:03:57,837
I'm running away from all of you!

1091
01:04:00,359 --> 01:04:01,986
I have to remain alive to the end.

1092
01:04:01,987 --> 01:04:03,680
I'm all alone now.

1093
01:04:04,601 --> 01:04:07,065
[Chasing after her at the speed of light.]

1094
01:04:07,977 --> 01:04:09,526
Soo Mi, wait.

1095
01:04:11,441 --> 01:04:12,771
Stop right there!

1096
01:04:12,772 --> 01:04:14,273
Stop right there!

1097
01:04:26,492 --> 01:04:29,126
[What do I do...]

1098
01:04:29,127 --> 01:04:30,132
Come here.

1099
01:04:30,133 --> 01:04:33,754
[If a man gets eliminated by a gumiho,
he becomes the new gumiho's ally.]

1100
01:04:33,755 --> 01:04:36,173
- You're entranced by her now.
- How does that even make any sense?

1101
01:04:36,174 --> 01:04:38,469
Do your entrancement dance.

1102
01:04:38,470 --> 01:04:40,914
- What's your phone number?
- No more!

1103
01:04:41,781 --> 01:04:43,580
What's your name?

1104
01:04:44,352 --> 01:04:49,409
[the Giraffe becoming entranced
by Gumiho Eun Ee.]

1105
01:04:50,586 --> 01:04:52,697
<i>I can't... I can't deny it any further.</i>

1106
01:04:56,169 --> 01:04:59,617
[Transformed into a pink colored shirt
just like Gumiho Eun Ee.]

1107
01:04:59,652 --> 01:05:01,279
No, Ri Sae!

1108
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:03,062
What's your name?

1109
01:05:03,063 --> 01:05:05,376
- What's your number?
- I can't endure this any longer!

1110
01:05:05,377 --> 01:05:07,076
My number is...

1111
01:05:07,077 --> 01:05:08,882
I can't endure this any longer.
Why do I feel this way?

1112
01:05:08,883 --> 01:05:10,870
[Having lost his mind over
Gumiho Eun Ee's allure.]

1113
01:05:10,871 --> 01:05:12,270
Ri Sae!

1114
01:05:12,271 --> 01:05:16,088
[The Giraffe is now Gumiho Eun Ee's ally.]

1115
01:05:18,502 --> 01:05:19,793
Hey, rookie.

1116
01:05:19,794 --> 01:05:23,895
I'm the first.
I'm her real guardian.

1117
01:05:23,896 --> 01:05:25,449
You think just because she has you,
she can't have me either?

1118
01:05:25,450 --> 01:05:27,550
You can't take my place.
You won't take my spot away from me.

1119
01:05:27,551 --> 01:05:31,887
- I'm going to work hard to take his place.
- Who do you think you are? How dare you!

1120
01:05:31,888 --> 01:05:34,562
[Spellbound men fighting over
their position amongst themselves.]

1121
01:05:34,563 --> 01:05:36,397
Who do you think you are?

1122
01:05:37,305 --> 01:05:39,733
[An embarrassing scene
for everyone involved.]

1123
01:05:40,479 --> 01:05:42,317
Eun Ee has both of them now?

1124
01:05:44,106 --> 01:05:46,244
How did she get so lucky?

1125
01:05:46,936 --> 01:05:50,127
- How did she get so lucky?
- We have to eliminate one of them.

1126
01:05:50,128 --> 01:05:52,488
- Let's go.
- Let's go over there right now.

1127
01:05:52,489 --> 01:05:56,290
I'll grab Ha Ha and you have to
try to eliminate his name tag.

1128
01:05:56,291 --> 01:05:57,379
- Okay?
- Okay?

1129
01:05:57,414 --> 01:05:58,894
It's Jae Suk!

1130
01:06:01,313 --> 01:06:03,417
Remember her elbow.
You'd better watch yourself.

1131
01:06:03,418 --> 01:06:05,752
- There are three of us here though.
- Watch out for her elbow.

1132
01:06:06,471 --> 01:06:09,427
I have two subjects working
for me right now.

1133
01:06:09,428 --> 01:06:11,512
- You'd better watch yourself.
- You'd better be careful.

1134
01:06:11,513 --> 01:06:13,783
- Soo Mi...
- Go grab Jae Suk right now.

1135
01:06:14,594 --> 01:06:17,561
[Ha Ha and Kwang Soo attacking
Jae Suk as their target!]

1136
01:06:19,012 --> 01:06:20,363
Grab Jae Suk!

1137
01:06:22,503 --> 01:06:23,833
Oh my goodness!

1138
01:06:26,901 --> 01:06:28,866
Go! Get away from me!

1139
01:06:30,527 --> 01:06:31,718
Get away from me, you scoundrel!

1140
01:06:33,098 --> 01:06:35,808
[Gumiho Soo Mi attacking the Giraffe
with full force!]

1141
01:06:37,349 --> 01:06:40,315
Go!
Get away from me right now!

1142
01:06:43,294 --> 01:06:46,980
[Giraffe is now entranced by
Gumiho Soo Mi!]

1143
01:06:46,981 --> 01:06:49,649
- What are you doing?
- What's your deal?

1144
01:06:49,650 --> 01:06:52,005
[Who does he think he's messing with?]

1145
01:06:52,601 --> 01:06:55,440
- What is his deal?
- What just happened?

1146
01:06:56,410 --> 01:06:59,392
[He now has to change into an orange shirt
to join Jae Suk and Soo Mi's team.]

1147
01:06:59,393 --> 01:07:02,067
- Are you okay, Soo Mi?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

1148
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:04,260
I'm sorry for cussing you out.

1149
01:07:04,261 --> 01:07:05,786
I called him a scoundrel.

1150
01:07:08,335 --> 01:07:09,779
- Okay, Kwang Soo.
- Yes, Jae Suk.

1151
01:07:09,780 --> 01:07:11,755
[Now these three are on the same team.]

1152
01:07:12,130 --> 01:07:14,685
I've been under Eun Ee's spell
for all of three seconds.

1153
01:07:14,720 --> 01:07:17,362
- Really?
- I'm not that flighty of a person!

1154
01:07:17,363 --> 01:07:22,110
- He's bouncing around all over the place.
- I usually stay loyal to only one person.

1155
01:07:22,111 --> 01:07:23,808
Just go and change your shirt.

1156
01:07:25,314 --> 01:07:27,279
I love you.
I love you!

1157
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:31,992
[His style is to fall in love easily.]

1158
01:07:33,040 --> 01:07:36,470
- I will do my best to serve you.
- Change your shirt.

1159
01:07:37,221 --> 01:07:39,420
This is scary.
I don't know where they'll jump out from.

1160
01:07:39,421 --> 01:07:42,044
- You really have to be careful.
- I'm going to have nightmares about this.

1161
01:07:42,690 --> 01:07:44,199
- It's scary.
- You have to be careful.

1162
01:07:46,037 --> 01:07:50,678
- But those girls are not to be messed with.
- Ji Hyo, she really is no joke.

1163
01:07:51,343 --> 01:07:53,526
- Should we slowly get going?
- Eun Ee's no joke either.

1164
01:07:53,527 --> 01:07:54,968
I know.
I have to watch out for Eun Ee too.

1165
01:07:55,741 --> 01:07:59,164
She used to be pretty athletic
back in her day.

1166
01:08:00,884 --> 01:08:03,522
Why is it taking you all day to
change your shirt?

1167
01:08:03,523 --> 01:08:05,831
We're in a hurry.
Be quick and change you shirt.

1168
01:08:07,575 --> 01:08:10,135
Shouldn't you be welcoming me
with open arms right now?

1169
01:08:10,828 --> 01:08:13,804
- We've got ourselves another lump now.
- How am I a lump?

1170
01:08:13,805 --> 01:08:15,514
- Seriously.
- Soo Mi, where are you going?

1171
01:08:16,056 --> 01:08:20,890
[She needs to reattach Kwang Soo's
name tag for him to be resurrected.]

1172
01:08:23,141 --> 01:08:27,486
[Giraffe is now resurrected under
Gumiho Soo Mi's spell.]

1173
01:08:28,573 --> 01:08:30,083
Since there are two...

1174
01:08:30,679 --> 01:08:33,255
Since there are two of you now,
we have to eliminate one of the girls.

1175
01:08:33,256 --> 01:08:36,361
Even though I'm your second,
can you be more affectionate with me?

1176
01:08:36,362 --> 01:08:39,582
She's too focused on the game
right now to think of doing that.

1177
01:08:39,583 --> 01:08:42,169
I feel like we're in the scene from,
'Marrying the Mafia'.

1178
01:08:42,271 --> 01:08:45,061
[A scene from 'Marrying the Mafia'.]

1179
01:08:45,062 --> 01:08:49,314
[On the other hand, Gary and So Hyun,
the older woman and younger man couple. ]

1180
01:08:50,230 --> 01:08:55,758
[Who will the frail Gumiho So Hyun
be able to eliminate?]

1181
01:08:56,716 --> 01:08:58,258
- Over there.
- I see.

1182
01:08:59,212 --> 01:09:00,655
There's Gary over there.

1183
01:09:01,652 --> 01:09:02,778
Gary!

1184
01:09:03,572 --> 01:09:06,548
- Tell him to come over here.
- I don't even need to say it, do I?

1185
01:09:07,434 --> 01:09:09,320
- Let's go get Jae Suk together.
- You agree with us, don't you?

1186
01:09:09,321 --> 01:09:11,503
Of course!
That's a given!

1187
01:09:11,504 --> 01:09:12,568
[Their plan if to go after Jae Suk
and Soo Mi and their eight tails for now.]

1188
01:09:12,569 --> 01:09:14,413
Come here, So Hyun.
We still need to be careful.

1189
01:09:14,414 --> 01:09:17,135
- Yeah, you're right.
- Jong Kook and Suk makes me nervous.

1190
01:09:17,136 --> 01:09:19,353
- What did you say?
- Hang on a second.

1191
01:09:19,354 --> 01:09:21,737
Why is your right hand in that position?

1192
01:09:21,738 --> 01:09:23,203
Why are you being like that?

1193
01:09:23,832 --> 01:09:29,141
[Unable to trust each other.]

1194
01:09:29,142 --> 01:09:31,540
Even though Suk may do something like that,
I'd never be like that.

1195
01:09:31,846 --> 01:09:33,735
I can't even eliminate a man's name tag.

1196
01:09:33,736 --> 01:09:35,791
- But you can eliminate mine.
- Yes, I can eliminate yours.

1197
01:09:35,792 --> 01:09:38,167
They can betray us at any time,
so you have to always be careful.

1198
01:09:38,995 --> 01:09:43,098
- Because they can turn on us at any moment.
- Let's eliminate someone with a lot of tails.

1199
01:09:43,099 --> 01:09:47,399
We have to eliminate Jae Suk first.
They only need one more to win.

1200
01:09:47,400 --> 01:09:49,353
They only need one more tail
for them to win the game.

1201
01:09:53,548 --> 01:09:56,491
[Eun Ee attacks So Hyun's name tag
and eliminates it!]

1202
01:09:57,398 --> 01:10:00,886
[Gumiho Eun Ee never loses her chance
when she sees one!]

1203
01:10:00,887 --> 01:10:03,367
You're the best.
Wow... Eun Ee, you're amazing.

1204
01:10:03,368 --> 01:10:04,662
[Totally betrayed.]

1205
01:10:04,663 --> 01:10:06,952
You're so fast!
Wow... I can't believe how quick you are.

1206
01:10:06,953 --> 01:10:08,652
You're seriously the best.

1207
01:10:08,653 --> 01:10:14,444
[Too bad...
Gary and So Hyun had seven tails!]

1208
01:10:14,445 --> 01:10:18,688
[Gumiho So Hyun - Out!]

1209
01:10:28,748 --> 01:10:32,268
We should've targeted So Hyun.
Why are there so many people there?

1210
01:10:32,997 --> 01:10:36,452
- They're all headed somewhere.
- They're all looking around.

1211
01:10:36,453 --> 01:10:40,272
- We have to somehow separate them first.
- What are you doing? You scared me.

1212
01:10:40,273 --> 01:10:44,094
You have to always be on the lookout.
It's a habit of mine now. Stay cautious.

1213
01:10:44,095 --> 01:10:46,143
They're coming.
They're coming this way right now.

1214
01:10:46,144 --> 01:10:49,276
[All the couple starting to
head over in their direction.]

1215
01:10:49,277 --> 01:10:51,423
Let's back out of here for now.

1216
01:10:51,424 --> 01:10:53,291
Since they're coming from that way,
let's go around this way.

1217
01:10:53,292 --> 01:10:54,849
We don't know where
they're going to come from.

1218
01:10:54,850 --> 01:10:59,541
[Whether she likes it or not,
best choice is to listen to Mr. Capable.]

1219
01:10:59,542 --> 01:11:01,449
You have to go around like this
so that they can't know where you're at.

1220
01:11:02,002 --> 01:11:05,926
You always look so aggressive on the show,
but why are you being so passive right now?

1221
01:11:05,927 --> 01:11:07,637
They're running.
I can see them running.

1222
01:11:07,638 --> 01:11:09,854
They're running.
I can see them running.

1223
01:11:09,855 --> 01:11:12,744
[Eun Ee and Ha Ha figure out
what's going on.]

1224
01:11:15,440 --> 01:11:18,818
[It seems as though everyone is
gathering up at one place.]

1225
01:11:19,235 --> 01:11:22,161
- Let's go this way.
- Let's go back to where we were.

1226
01:11:22,162 --> 01:11:24,704
- Why do they keep circling around here?
- Hurry up and come this way!

1227
01:11:26,660 --> 01:11:28,895
- We have nowhere else to run to!
- We're not running away.

1228
01:11:28,896 --> 01:11:30,802
There's something going on over there.

1229
01:11:31,606 --> 01:11:33,830
There are two men on that team.

1230
01:11:33,831 --> 01:11:35,886
[The two team discussing eliminating
the team with the eight tails first.]

1231
01:11:35,887 --> 01:11:38,292
You can grab Kwang Soo,
and I'll grab Jae Suk.

1232
01:11:38,293 --> 01:11:40,808
- Then one of the girls can eliminate Soo Mi.
- That sounds like a plan.

1233
01:11:40,809 --> 01:11:43,204
This will work as long as the two of you
don't betray us.

1234
01:11:43,205 --> 01:11:45,369
[The plan could work as long as
they don't betray the other two...]

1235
01:11:46,569 --> 01:11:50,441
[Just then, Soo Mi, Jae Suk and Kwang Soo
starts heading in their direction.]

1236
01:11:50,442 --> 01:11:53,001
Hang on.
Don't do anything and just hang on.

1237
01:11:53,776 --> 01:11:55,463
Don't forget what we all
just agreed to.

1238
01:11:55,464 --> 01:11:58,107
They always say that you'll
meet your enemy under the bridge.

1239
01:11:58,161 --> 01:12:00,562
I have two subjects now.
I got myself another guard.

1240
01:12:00,563 --> 01:12:03,320
Lee Kwang Soo, how can you do that?
How can you try to eliminate us right away?

1241
01:12:03,321 --> 01:12:05,098
Lee Kwang Soo, what are you doing?

1242
01:12:05,099 --> 01:12:08,099
[Jae Suk and Kwang Soo starts their
protection of Gumiho Soo Mi!]

1243
01:12:09,681 --> 01:12:11,961
[While Suk Jin and Ha Ha are protecting
the two men under Soo Mi's spell...]

1244
01:12:11,962 --> 01:12:16,493
[Eun Ee and Ji Hyo are targeting
Soo Mi's name tag!]

1245
01:12:17,815 --> 01:12:19,065
Run away from here!

1246
01:12:19,482 --> 01:12:21,720
Run away, Soo Mi!

1247
01:12:30,296 --> 01:12:33,500
[Spellbound again!]

1248
01:12:34,931 --> 01:12:36,893
What's your deal?

1249
01:12:36,991 --> 01:12:39,099
[What's his problem?]

1250
01:12:40,011 --> 01:12:45,969
[Giraffe is now under Ji Hyo's spell.]

1251
01:12:45,970 --> 01:12:49,088
- Just what is his deal?
- I was trying to block them off!

1252
01:12:49,089 --> 01:12:51,808
Are you doing a fashion show?
How many times are you going to change?

1253
01:12:51,809 --> 01:12:55,965
- He's just jumping from team to team!
- I'm not that flighty of a person.

1254
01:12:55,966 --> 01:12:57,258
How can you say that you're not flighty?

1255
01:12:57,632 --> 01:13:02,318
[Now he has to change his t-shirt
for the fourth time today.]

1256
01:13:02,677 --> 01:13:04,838
I'll just put several layers
of shirts on over this one.

1257
01:13:04,839 --> 01:13:06,444
Since I don't know which team
I'm going to end up on.

1258
01:13:06,445 --> 01:13:09,005
- Just give him several shirts.
- I'll wear several shirts all at once.

1259
01:13:12,860 --> 01:13:14,694
Put the name tag on me, Ji Hyo.

1260
01:13:14,695 --> 01:13:18,084
[Resurrected as Ji Hyo's man.]

1261
01:13:19,054 --> 01:13:22,757
[Now Ji Hyo, Suk Jin and
Kwang Soo are a team.]

1262
01:13:22,758 --> 01:13:24,632
- They're here.
- They're here.

1263
01:13:24,633 --> 01:13:27,500
- Let's see what they're doing.
- Someone is coming.

1264
01:13:28,097 --> 01:13:30,910
- You should just hold on to it.
- Come here. You're on our team now.

1265
01:13:30,911 --> 01:13:32,518
[Oh yeah!]

1266
01:13:33,484 --> 01:13:36,091
[Confused from having switched
teams so many times.]

1267
01:13:36,092 --> 01:13:39,420
What in the world is going on?
How many times are you changing teams?

1268
01:13:39,421 --> 01:13:41,270
- Where's Ri Sae?
- This is his third time.

1269
01:13:41,271 --> 01:13:43,907
- Who's Ri Sae?
- Where di Ri Sae go?

1270
01:13:43,908 --> 01:13:46,086
- That's right, I don't see Ri Sae.
- Ri Sae is missing.

1271
01:13:46,504 --> 01:13:49,666
[Ah... Ri Sae...]

1272
01:13:50,290 --> 01:13:51,601
Ri Sae!

1273
01:13:54,909 --> 01:13:59,370
If Ri Sae eliminates your name tag...
then don't you go back to being her partner?

1274
01:13:59,405 --> 01:14:02,776
- Here they come.
- Soo Mi, can we talk first?

1275
01:14:02,777 --> 01:14:04,948
Let's go.
Let's get out of here for now.

1276
01:14:04,949 --> 01:14:06,744
Grab Jae Suk.
Be careful.

1277
01:14:07,902 --> 01:14:10,516
[The target-
Gumiho Kim Soo Mi and her eight tails!]

1278
01:14:10,517 --> 01:14:12,902
[I need to escape from here.]

1279
01:14:14,248 --> 01:14:16,694
[Jae Suk in extreme danger!]

1280
01:14:26,812 --> 01:14:30,144
[Wow... spellbound again?]

1281
01:14:30,145 --> 01:14:31,404
What is he doing?

1282
01:14:31,653 --> 01:14:33,587
Did you really have to do that
when we're already working together?

1283
01:14:33,588 --> 01:14:35,898
I just grabbed anything I could
because I was feeling so anxious.

1284
01:14:35,899 --> 01:14:37,334
You need to fix that habit of yours!

1285
01:14:38,300 --> 01:14:41,119
[Going around a full circle
to go back to being on Eun Ee's team.]

1286
01:14:41,881 --> 01:14:44,622
Kwang Soo's eliminated again?
He got his name tag eliminated again?

1287
01:14:44,623 --> 01:14:45,739
He got his name tag ripped off again?

1288
01:14:46,170 --> 01:14:48,129
He's like the neighborhood kick can.

1289
01:14:49,341 --> 01:14:54,138
[On the other hand, Gumiho Soo Mi takes
the chance to flee from the chaos.]

1290
01:15:00,375 --> 01:15:02,798
[Meeting back up with Jae Suk.]

1291
01:15:02,799 --> 01:15:04,450
You have to be careful.

1292
01:15:04,451 --> 01:15:06,707
You have to be careful.
Always watch your back.

1293
01:15:09,929 --> 01:15:12,728
[Grabs a huge mop?]

1294
01:15:18,576 --> 01:15:20,718
Why do they keep attacking Soo Mi?

1295
01:15:20,719 --> 01:15:22,316
They just won't leave us alone.

1296
01:15:25,330 --> 01:15:29,906
[Giraffe back to being on Eun Ee's team
in his pink shirt.]

1297
01:15:31,072 --> 01:15:36,574
[Unwavering in their targeting of
Gumiho Soo Mi and her eight tails.]

1298
01:15:36,575 --> 01:15:39,159
[Discovered!]

1299
01:15:43,518 --> 01:15:44,690
There they are again.

1300
01:15:44,691 --> 01:15:46,428
- There they come.
- Want us to help you?

1301
01:15:46,798 --> 01:15:49,534
[Ji Hyo and Suk Jin reaching out
their hand to help?]

1302
01:15:49,535 --> 01:15:51,332
Are you offering to help them?

1303
01:15:51,333 --> 01:15:55,364
- Think about it, Suk Jin.
- They only need one more to win.

1304
01:15:55,789 --> 01:15:58,372
- We have to eliminate them first.
- They already have eight tails.

1305
01:15:58,373 --> 01:16:00,839
- What did you say?
- Do you want to get beat up again?

1306
01:16:05,570 --> 01:16:09,274
[They're right.
If we're not careful, Soo Mi will win.]

1307
01:16:10,252 --> 01:16:15,657
[Gumiho Eun Ee's team slowly
closing in on them.]

1308
01:16:19,201 --> 01:16:20,667
Rip it off!
Rip off her name tag!

1309
01:16:22,405 --> 01:16:25,994
[Gumiho Soo Mi is caught!]

1310
01:16:25,995 --> 01:16:27,418
Get her!
Eliminate her!

1311
01:16:32,895 --> 01:16:37,946
[Eun Ee eliminates Soo Mi's name tag.]

1312
01:16:37,947 --> 01:16:39,781
- We already had eight tails!
- Sorry, Soo Mi.

1313
01:16:40,712 --> 01:16:42,407
Why didn't you use your elbow on her?

1314
01:16:43,364 --> 01:16:46,369
I used my leg on her instead.
I should've elbowed her first.

1315
01:16:48,609 --> 01:16:50,472
She flung out her leg instead
of elbowing her first?

1316
01:16:51,212 --> 01:16:52,750
She's angry right now.

1317
01:16:52,751 --> 01:16:54,400
Seriously...

1318
01:17:07,109 --> 01:17:09,128
Your quick speed is no joke.

1319
01:17:09,129 --> 01:17:10,607
[Eun Ee, Ha Ha and Kwang Soo
are about to sweep up the game!]

1320
01:17:10,608 --> 01:17:12,580
- This is our Eun Ee.
- What's your name again?

1321
01:17:12,581 --> 01:17:15,891
Lee Kwang Soo!
My number is...

1322
01:17:15,892 --> 01:17:18,192
- My name is Ha Dong Hoon!
- What is your number?

1323
01:17:19,426 --> 01:17:21,207
You just remember that you
come after me.

1324
01:17:21,208 --> 01:17:22,689
- No.
- She's mine.

1325
01:17:23,004 --> 01:17:24,992
I've never once thought of myself
as coming in as second from the beginning.

1326
01:17:24,993 --> 01:17:27,731
She's mine!
Who do you think you are?

1327
01:17:27,732 --> 01:17:31,098
No! I'm going to oust you
and have her for myself!

1328
01:17:31,449 --> 01:17:33,598
There, there.
You can each have half of my wealth.

1329
01:17:33,599 --> 01:17:34,920
- Thank you.
- Let's go.

1330
01:17:35,221 --> 01:17:36,624
I love you.

1331
01:17:38,772 --> 01:17:40,637
Let's go get Ri Sae.

1332
01:17:41,359 --> 01:17:45,754
[A nice and easy prey.
A lone Ri Sae without her Kwang Soo.]

1333
01:17:45,755 --> 01:17:49,232
- We should've gotten someone in that chaos.
- Just where did Ri Sae go?

1334
01:17:49,233 --> 01:17:52,184
- Let's go get her right now.
- Let's go find her and get her.

1335
01:17:53,426 --> 01:17:55,199
Ri Sae.

1336
01:17:55,200 --> 01:17:56,823
Come here, Ri Sae.

1337
01:17:57,440 --> 01:18:00,643
Come to me instead of getting caught
by that other scary lady.

1338
01:18:01,014 --> 01:18:03,706
I'll make sure that you're not hurt
when I eliminate you.

1339
01:18:09,044 --> 01:18:14,390
[Having entered the interior of the museum
in their search for Ri Sae.]

1340
01:18:16,273 --> 01:18:18,372
Where are you, Ri Sae?

1341
01:18:18,692 --> 01:18:20,844
Come here, Ri Sae.

1342
01:18:34,982 --> 01:18:36,112
Who is that?

1343
01:18:36,435 --> 01:18:38,306
[Just then...]

1344
01:18:38,307 --> 01:18:41,681
[Suk and Jong Kook comes face to face
with Eun Ee, Ha Ha and Kwang Soo.]

1345
01:18:42,297 --> 01:18:44,468
[A face-off]

1346
01:18:44,469 --> 01:18:46,769
- There's no reason to avoid them.
- Let's just face them.

1347
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:49,748
Why do they look so angry?
Look at that angry couple.

1348
01:18:51,097 --> 01:18:52,472
What's going on?

1349
01:18:53,110 --> 01:18:54,739
How many tails do you have?

1350
01:18:54,740 --> 01:18:57,599
I don't have a lot.
I don't have as many as you do.

1351
01:18:57,600 --> 01:19:00,525
It doesn't matter how many tails
since you can only get one from elimination.

1352
01:19:00,526 --> 01:19:02,084
I just want to know how close
you are to winning.

1353
01:19:02,356 --> 01:19:05,861
We're going to eliminate your team,
and move on to the next one to win.

1354
01:19:06,594 --> 01:19:09,258
- You have seven right now?
- Kwang Soo is being really aggressive.

1355
01:19:09,259 --> 01:19:10,995
Get him.

1356
01:19:13,451 --> 01:19:14,674
Eun Ee!
Come and get her!

1357
01:19:14,675 --> 01:19:17,780
[At this rate,
it's Gumiho Eun Ee vs. Gumiho Suk!]

1358
01:19:17,781 --> 01:19:18,788
Eun Ee!

1359
01:19:21,384 --> 01:19:25,359
[Feisty gumihos pulling on each other
by their hair!]

1360
01:19:25,360 --> 01:19:26,646
You can't grab her by her hair!

1361
01:19:26,647 --> 01:19:28,674
[Ji Hyo and Suk Jin arrive at that
moment to join in on the melee!]

1362
01:19:31,133 --> 01:19:32,702
- What's going on here?
- Come here, Ji Hyo!

1363
01:19:33,327 --> 01:19:35,772
[Complete chaos!]

1364
01:19:35,773 --> 01:19:36,921
Are you okay?

1365
01:19:36,956 --> 01:19:40,528
[Gumiho Suk not worrying about her body and
doing what she can to protect her name tag!]

1366
01:19:40,529 --> 01:19:42,687
Run!
Run away from here!

1367
01:19:43,373 --> 01:19:44,899
Run away from here!

1368
01:19:46,802 --> 01:19:48,190
Run away from here, Eun Ee!

1369
01:19:49,377 --> 01:19:53,806
[Are you guys doing this on purpose?]

1370
01:19:54,316 --> 01:19:57,392
[Just how many times has it been?]

1371
01:19:57,393 --> 01:20:01,513
[Now Suk, Jong Kook and Kwang Soo
are a team.]

1372
01:20:02,833 --> 01:20:05,933
Kwang Soo has now worn shirts
of every different color.

1373
01:20:07,197 --> 01:20:11,346
[Congratulations, Kwang Soo!
You've been in all five different colors!]

1374
01:20:11,347 --> 01:20:13,916
Kwang Soo, this makes a
grand slam for you!

1375
01:20:13,917 --> 01:20:16,398
[A grand slam!]

1376
01:20:16,844 --> 01:20:20,166
- Come here. Hurry.
- Come here. Let's not betray each other.

1377
01:20:21,243 --> 01:20:22,685
I can guarantee that
they're going to work together.

1378
01:20:22,686 --> 01:20:23,881
So what we have to do is...

1379
01:20:23,916 --> 01:20:25,898
This isn't the time for us to
be battling amongst ourselves.

1380
01:20:25,899 --> 01:20:27,752
- We have to work together.
- Think about this carefully.

1381
01:20:27,753 --> 01:20:31,195
If you eliminate me or take Suk Jin onto
your team, you'll be eliminated right away.

1382
01:20:31,196 --> 01:20:33,761
[Mr. Capable was difficult enough,
but now even Kwang Soo on their team?]

1383
01:20:33,761 --> 01:20:35,568
You know that if we eliminate each other,
then it's an immediate end for us, right?

1384
01:20:35,569 --> 01:20:37,411
- That's why we need to work together.
- Let's go find Ri Sae.

1385
01:20:37,726 --> 01:20:40,751
Let's go find Ri Sae and have her
join our side.

1386
01:20:40,752 --> 01:20:42,572
- Let's go get her and we all take them on.
- That's a good idea.

1387
01:20:42,573 --> 01:20:44,944
If we find Ri Sae,
we may have a chance to beat them.

1388
01:20:45,291 --> 01:20:47,440
I bet you Ri Sae can put Kwang Soo
back under her spell.

1389
01:20:47,441 --> 01:20:50,155
- Good. I like that idea.
- Kwang Soo will then go back to her.

1390
01:20:50,156 --> 01:20:53,222
[Use Ri Sae to get Kwang Soo under her spell
to get him away from the other team.]

1391
01:20:53,223 --> 01:20:55,068
- Lets send him back.
- Yes, that's the plan.

1392
01:20:55,069 --> 01:21:00,493
[Will they succeed in their plan to
put Kwang Soo back in his original spot?]

1393
01:21:00,494 --> 01:21:02,413
- You have to protect my back, okay?
- I understand.

1394
01:21:02,414 --> 01:21:05,907
[But right at that time, Kwang Soo is
practicing being loyal to Gumiho Suk.]

1395
01:21:05,908 --> 01:21:07,165
That's a good stance.

1396
01:21:07,166 --> 01:21:08,340
There you go.

1397
01:21:09,961 --> 01:21:11,762
- The sun is too bright.
- I'm sorry.

1398
01:21:11,763 --> 01:21:13,376
What are you doing?
Hurry up and block the sun.

1399
01:21:15,460 --> 01:21:16,765
Ri Sae.

1400
01:21:16,766 --> 01:21:18,496
- Ri Sae.
- Ri Sae.

1401
01:21:19,986 --> 01:21:23,842
[The other two couples are rushing around
to find Gumiho Ri Sae.]

1402
01:21:23,843 --> 01:21:24,931
Ri Sae.

1403
01:21:24,932 --> 01:21:26,584
- Check over there.
- Don't be afraid.

1404
01:21:26,585 --> 01:21:29,120
Ri Sae.
We're on your side. Ri Sae.

1405
01:21:29,121 --> 01:21:32,146
[Not easy to find Ri Sae who's hid herself
deep away out of her fear for others.]

1406
01:21:32,147 --> 01:21:34,088
- Ri Sae.
- Let's join forces and work together.

1407
01:21:34,089 --> 01:21:35,650
- Ri Sae.
- We have to join our forces together.

1408
01:21:35,651 --> 01:21:37,510
- Ri Sae, you can trust me.
- Ri Sae.

1409
01:21:38,162 --> 01:21:41,952
[Finally discovers Ri Sae!]

1410
01:21:41,953 --> 01:21:43,616
- We're serious. We're not coming for you.
- We really do have to work together.

1411
01:21:43,617 --> 01:21:45,207
- Are you being honest with me?
- We're being honest. Let's work together.

1412
01:21:45,208 --> 01:21:47,082
We're being honest.
Over here. She's over here.

1413
01:21:47,083 --> 01:21:49,273
- Ji Hyo, we're over here.
- We finally found Ri Sae.

1414
01:21:49,725 --> 01:21:51,709
- We're being honest.
- Ri Sae.

1415
01:21:51,710 --> 01:21:53,949
- Listen. Hear us out.
- Listen to us carefully.

1416
01:21:54,689 --> 01:22:00,276
[First priority is to calm Ri Sae down
and calmly explain things to her.]

1417
01:22:00,277 --> 01:22:02,092
We have to pull that team apart.

1418
01:22:02,093 --> 01:22:05,302
So we're trying to recruit you.
We're not trying to oust you, okay?

1419
01:22:05,303 --> 01:22:06,963
- So you have to get Kwang Soo back.
- Our plan is...

1420
01:22:06,964 --> 01:22:09,901
We're trying to get you to rip off
Kwang Soo's name tag and return him to you.

1421
01:22:10,521 --> 01:22:12,308
[Really?]

1422
01:22:12,309 --> 01:22:13,827
I'll hold onto Jong Kook while you do it.

1423
01:22:13,828 --> 01:22:18,263
And one of us will eliminate Suk
in the meantime

1424
01:22:18,264 --> 01:22:21,704
and while we're doing that, you
have to rip off Kwang Soo's name tag.

1425
01:22:22,067 --> 01:22:26,953
[Will Gumiho Ri Sae be able to
bring Kwang Soo back to her?]

1426
01:22:27,662 --> 01:22:30,139
[At the same time]

1427
01:22:31,252 --> 01:22:34,512
- I think she's too scared to come outside.
- I think you're right.

1428
01:22:35,437 --> 01:22:37,816
- What is that?
- Look.

1429
01:22:38,431 --> 01:22:41,819
- Oh my goodness.
- Look at how beautiful it is outside.

1430
01:22:41,820 --> 01:22:44,364
I found the woman who's going to
weave a spell on you.

1431
01:22:45,617 --> 01:22:51,071
[Ri Sae... is back.]

1432
01:22:51,072 --> 01:22:53,665
- Ri Sae.
- Can you deny Ri Sae?

1433
01:22:54,025 --> 01:22:58,934
[The woman Kwang Soo spent the whole day
building everlasting sweet memories with.]

1434
01:22:58,935 --> 01:23:00,285
What is this?

1435
01:23:00,286 --> 01:23:03,150
- Why did you bring her here?
- There he is.

1436
01:23:03,151 --> 01:23:05,459
I told you not to show up
at my work!

1437
01:23:05,473 --> 01:23:08,707
- Kwang Soo.
- I told you not to come when I'm working!

1438
01:23:09,118 --> 01:23:11,246
Wait... wait!

1439
01:23:12,401 --> 01:23:15,087
[Suk Jin and Ha Ha grabbing Jong Kook
just like they had planned!]

1440
01:23:15,284 --> 01:23:17,152
- Hurry!
- Let's go get Kwang Soo!

1441
01:23:17,153 --> 01:23:19,397
[Now's the chance!]

1442
01:23:19,398 --> 01:23:20,956
Kwang Soo!
Kwang Soo!

1443
01:23:20,957 --> 01:23:23,736
- Grab him!
- Hurry!

1444
01:23:25,916 --> 01:23:27,838
- Ri Sae!
- Go grab Kwang Soo!

1445
01:23:27,839 --> 01:23:31,127
[Eun Ee and Ji Hyo's target is Kim Suk!
And Ri Sae targets Kwang Soo!]

1446
01:23:31,128 --> 01:23:32,318
Hurry up and rip off his name tag!

1447
01:23:34,063 --> 01:23:37,156
[She rips it off!]

1448

out on the street anywhere.

Don't ever come around Mapogu.

1468
