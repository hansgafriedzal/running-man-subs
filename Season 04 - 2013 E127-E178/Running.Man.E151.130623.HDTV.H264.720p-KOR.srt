00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:14,980
[What?
Big-nosed Brother succeeds!]

166
00:08:15,784 --> 00:08:17,734
- I succeeded!
- How did that happen?

167
00:08:19,487 --> 00:08:21,512
It must've been pure luck.

168
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:24,654
- You can't just be wearing your underwear.
- These aren't my underwear.

169
00:08:24,655 --> 00:08:26,780
[His shorts looking like underwear on him
with his extra-long legs.]

170
00:08:26,781 --> 00:08:28,383
- How can you think they're underwear?
- Those aren't your panties?

171
00:08:28,384 --> 00:08:30,649
How can you think that
they're panties?

172
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:33,008
- They're not panties?
- I took care choosing my outfit today.

173
00:08:33,008 --> 00:08:35,326
Really?
I thought they were your panties.

174
00:08:35,403 --> 00:08:37,583
I think the wall helps out.
Maybe I should utilize that.

175
00:08:37,584 --> 00:08:38,680
[Moving over to the wall?]

176
00:08:38,681 --> 00:08:40,175
What are you doing?

177
00:08:40,176 --> 00:08:41,786
What do you think you're doing?

178
00:08:41,787 --> 00:08:43,491
[What is he doing by the wall?]

179
00:08:46,383 --> 00:08:49,011
I'm just trying to use different
methods to get it done.

180
00:08:49,012 --> 00:08:50,359
Good luck with that.

181

[You saw that, right?]

188
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:12,859
That is seriously so annoying.

189
00:09:13,936 --> 00:09:15,902
[Unbelievable...]

190
00:09:16,515 --> 00:09:18,829
- You can all do it that way then.
- You can't look where you're throwing it.

191
00:09:19,071 --> 00:09:21,587
Move back even further.
That's how you do it.

192
00:09:23,372 --> 00:09:25,855
- Is he imitating you?
- Yeah, that's the way you do it.

193

Watch him.
That's the way you have to do it.

194
00:09:29,187 --> 00:09:31,298
- Wow! It worked!
- See?

195
00:09:31,299 --> 00:09:32,653
[A nice try?
Very close to the line.]

196
00:09:33,243 --> 00:09:35,497
You have to try out different methods.

197
00:09:35,498 --> 00:09:38,001
- I got it now.
- There you go. You can't look at it.

198
00:09:38,002 --> 00:09:39,227
[Hyo Joo also assumes the
peeper's position.]

199
00:09:39,228 --> 00:09:41,172
Don't think anything of it,
and just throw it out there.

200
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:45,302
- It worked! Wow!
- I can't believe it!

201

What the heck!

203
00:09:51,717 --> 00:09:54,065
What is it doing all the way back here?

204
00:09:54,066 --> 00:09:56,487
- He's trying something different.
- That's a good plan.

205
00:09:57,110 --> 00:10:00,165
[The street full of traditional Korean homes
being witness to all sorts of positions.]

206
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:01,989
- Look at how long his arm is.
- Look at his long legs.

207
00:10:02,459 --> 00:10:04,715
- Look... look at this.
- Come on!

208
00:10:11,151 --> 00:10:13,327
Did you see it?
You saw it, didn't you?

209
00:10:14,156 --> 00:10:16,270
Why did you grab me by that?

210
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:19,413
- I hate things like that.
- You had number one written on your butt.

211
00:10:19,414 --> 00:10:21,333

[That's our Blank Ji!
Success!]

217
00:10:33,697 --> 00:10:35,368
She's really good at things like this.

218
00:10:35,369 --> 00:10:37,903
Song Ji Hyo's always good,
but Lee Kwang Soo is always bad.

219
00:10:40,982 --> 00:10:43,187
- Dong Hoon. It's Dong Hoon's turn.
- So annoying!

220

without thinking.]

- Really?

224

- Don't think too much about it.
- Just throw it.

- That's the way to do it.
- We have to move the game along.

228
00:11:08,287 --> 00:11:10,076
- Just throw it.
- Don't think about it when you throw.

229
00:11:11,118 --> 00:11:12,944
- Hurry up and throw it.
- Don't think about where you're throwing it.

[The ultimate face-off.
Will it be the Giraffe or the Tiger?]

236

For some reason...
I've got some dirty rotten luck.

237

What dirty rotten luck?

238

to the next location.

363
00:17:05,853 --> 00:17:07,123
This is driving me crazy.

it's rather more trustworthy and dependable...

The way the proverb goes, it says,
'__ __ steps even if they're scattering steps'

[Hyo Joo guesses the correct answer.]

483
00:22:24,156 --> 00:22:26,227
That's why the millet field is red.
Because the tiger fell on the field.

484

- His blood reddened the field, right?

00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:50,369
I'm so relieved!

493
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:51,666
What did you say for your answer?

494
00:22:51,667 --> 00:22:54,640
[Two people to be eliminated with
only Jong Kook, Ha Ha and Gary left.]

495
00:22:55,636 --> 00:22:57,820
Jong Kook, just answer the question
so that these two can get eliminated.

496
00:22:58,021 --> 00:23:01,468
- In Hemingway's novel...
- Hemingway! He's my favorite!

497
00:23:01,469 --> 00:23:03,992
- I love Hemingway.
- He's my favorite author.

498
00:23:03,993 --> 00:23:06,276
- In the novel, 'Old Man and the Sea'...
- That's a great book!

499
00:23:06,277 --> 00:23:09,234
- I really love that book.
- Reading books like that are hard for me.

500
00:23:09,591 --> 00:23:17,040
What is the name of the country the old man
is said to go fishing in this novel?

501
00:23:17,041 --> 00:23:18,945
I'm not sure.
Spain?

502
00:23:21,261 --> 00:23:22,839
Germany!

503
00:23:24,583 --> 00:23:26,384
You're stupid.

504
00:23:27,048 --> 00:23:30,268
- I'll answer the question.
- Do you know the answer to this?

505
00:23:30,269 --> 00:23:31,875
Isn't it Norway?

506
00:23:31,876 --> 00:23:33,738
Ukraine!

507
00:23:35,670 --> 00:23:37,212
Ukraine!

508
00:23:40,624 --> 00:23:42,057
The Netherlands?

509
00:23:43,697 --> 00:23:45,597
- That's not it?
- Hey... I'll get it.

510
00:23:45,598 --> 00:23:47,080
France!

511
00:23:48,383 --> 00:23:49,929
Czechoslovakia.

512
00:23:53,149 --> 00:23:55,440
- Maracay!
- America.

513
00:23:56,768 --> 00:23:58,182
America.

514
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:00,786
Chile.

515
00:24:00,787 --> 00:24:03,514
[They may name every single country
in the world at this rate.]

516
00:24:03,515 --> 00:24:05,337
- Really?
- Yeah, it's nearby Chile.

517
00:24:05,338 --> 00:24:07,722
[Got pretty close to the area.]

518
00:24:07,723 --> 00:24:09,301
- It has to be a country by the ocean.
- The ocean?

519
00:24:10,578 --> 00:24:13,545
- It's close to America.
- Close to there?

520
00:24:13,546 --> 00:24:14,884
[A country close to America...]

521
00:24:14,885 --> 00:24:17,403
- I know! I figured it out!
- I know it now.

522
00:24:17,404 --> 00:24:20,169
- I totally got it figured out.
- I know!

523
00:24:20,426 --> 00:24:21,990
Cuba!

524
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:25,581
[Correct answer]

525
00:24:25,582 --> 00:24:28,634
- It's Cuba!
- It's next to Jamaica.

526
00:24:29,077 --> 00:24:30,869
- Cuba.
- Thus...

527
00:24:31,466 --> 00:24:34,264
The two kids... are eliminated.

528
00:24:34,265 --> 00:24:36,049
[Two kids, Ha Ha and Gary are eliminated.]

529
00:24:41,428 --> 00:24:44,216
[Surviving members head off
to the final location, 'R5'.]

530
00:24:50,323 --> 00:24:51,679
- Hurry! Come on.
- Hey!

531
00:24:52,944 --> 00:24:54,369
Why are you so fast?

532
00:24:54,995 --> 00:24:56,169
- What place did you get?
- First place.

533
00:24:56,170 --> 00:24:57,423
[What are the eliminated members
doing here?]

534
00:24:57,424 --> 00:24:59,807
- What are you doing here?
- Is this the next game?

535
00:24:59,808 --> 00:25:01,887
This is the lot of writer, Lee Sang's house.

536
00:25:01,888 --> 00:25:04,849
[Writer, Lee Sang's house.]

537
00:25:06,043 --> 00:25:10,029
This is called the six sided secret.

538
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:12,781
That's why you see the cube
sitting there before you.

539
00:25:12,782 --> 00:25:15,331
You have to match one side of the cube
to pass this mission.

540
00:25:17,296 --> 00:25:19,011
- How do you do this?
- How do we match this?

541
00:25:19,012 --> 00:25:20,575
[So hard...]

542
00:25:20,576 --> 00:25:22,167
- We tried this earlier.
- And?

543
00:25:22,168 --> 00:25:25,225
- Don't try to match a side.
- If you try to match it, you won't get it.

544
00:25:25,226 --> 00:25:27,553
- Really?
- You have to just start moving it around.

545
00:25:29,129 --> 00:25:31,078
[Turn it...]

546
00:25:31,079 --> 00:25:32,463
[Turn it...]

547
00:25:32,464 --> 00:25:34,677
[And turn it some more.]

548
00:25:34,678 --> 00:25:37,628
[No matter how hard they try
to match it...]

549
00:25:37,629 --> 00:25:41,037
Seeing Suk Jin in the mix of the finalists
is really making this feel awkward.

550
00:25:41,038 --> 00:25:42,096
Okay!

551
00:25:43,187 --> 00:25:44,319
Okay!

552
00:25:45,574 --> 00:25:47,945
[Mr. Capable succeeds!]

553
00:25:48,811 --> 00:25:51,186
[Big-nose Brother with his streak of luck
also succeeds!]

554
00:25:52,417 --> 00:25:53,701
Okay, you're all set.

555
00:25:53,702 --> 00:25:55,137
Wow, I did it.

556
00:25:55,138 --> 00:25:56,864
One of you two are to
be eliminated.

557
00:25:56,865 --> 00:25:58,583
I totally got that by fluke.

558
00:25:58,584 --> 00:26:00,822
- Really?
- I really tried to get it matched.

559
00:26:01,815 --> 00:26:05,903
- I really can't do these cubes.
- This reminds me of the 3x3 cubes.

560
00:26:05,904 --> 00:26:07,932
I'm good at doing those 3x3 ones.

561
00:26:07,933 --> 00:26:10,406
- But I get stuck with this instead.
- Look, you're getting there.

562
00:26:10,407 --> 00:26:13,203
- How beautiful... so beautiful.
- I think she's almost getting it.

563
00:26:13,204 --> 00:26:16,350
- Are you trying to match it?
- There's a way to do this.

564
00:26:16,351 --> 00:26:17,514
But...

565
00:26:17,515 --> 00:26:18,732
[Huh?]

566
00:26:18,733 --> 00:26:21,160
[But he continues to keep spinning?]

567
00:26:21,161 --> 00:26:23,586
- Why do you keep spinning when you have it?
- Why are you continuing to spin it around?

568
00:26:23,587 --> 00:26:25,731
- You had it!
- You have to look at all the sides.

569
00:26:25,732 --> 00:26:28,601
- You had the green side.
- You matched all the green!

570
00:26:28,602 --> 00:26:31,766
- I can't believe you did that.
- You had it but you just kept on spinning.

571
00:26:31,767 --> 00:26:33,169
You should've told me.

572
00:26:33,170 --> 00:26:35,048
- I have no idea.
- Take a good look.

573
00:26:35,049 --> 00:26:37,633
[One of the two will be
the final person to get eliminated.]

574
00:26:38,614 --> 00:26:41,378
- That's right.
- You have to match up the white line.

575
00:26:41,379 --> 00:26:43,356
- You have to match up that color.
- How?

576
00:26:43,357 --> 00:26:44,875
He's close to getting it.

577
00:26:46,408 --> 00:26:48,724
[Junho is first to succeed.]

578
00:26:48,725 --> 00:26:50,660
This always happens to me.

579
00:26:52,072 --> 00:26:55,469
After working so hard at it...
this always happens to me.

580
00:26:56,036 --> 00:26:58,812
[And she ran harder than anyone else...]

581
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,754
This all seem so futile.

582
00:27:01,757 --> 00:27:04,018
- This really seems so futile!
- Futile!

583
00:27:04,694 --> 00:27:06,996
- You're no different than Kwang Soo.
- I know.

584
00:27:09,238 --> 00:27:10,398
In the first come first serve game

585
00:27:10,399 --> 00:27:14,427
Kim Jong Kook, Ji Suk Jin and Junho
are the last three remaining survivors.

586
00:27:14,428 --> 00:27:15,754
Congratulations!

587
00:27:17,741 --> 00:27:20,150
- Congratulations to the three of you.
- I really congratulate all of you.

588
00:27:20,151 --> 00:27:21,784
- I'm one of the winners?
- Congratulations on your survival.

589
00:27:21,785 --> 00:27:23,401
Wow... I wonder what happens now?

590
00:27:23,402 --> 00:27:25,813
It is such an honor to be on
the same program as the three of you.

591
00:27:25,814 --> 00:27:28,212
They're trying to take a little break,
so you need to get out of the way.

592
00:27:28,568 --> 00:27:31,612
We have to get rid of all the untrustworthy
ones like those guys first.

593
00:27:31,613 --> 00:27:35,081
- You can trust us.
- We have three votes between the three of us.

594
00:27:35,517 --> 00:27:37,968
-These three are safe from elimination.
- Yes, that's right.

595
00:27:39,036 --> 00:27:41,771
All nine of you have your own
vote to cast.

596
00:27:41,772 --> 00:27:47,272
<i>So all nine of you will vote to choose just
one of these six to eliminate and be rid of.</i>

597
00:27:47,272 --> 00:27:49,387
What are you saying to Hyo Joo now?

598
00:27:49,388 --> 00:27:52,261
So we have to cast our votes by
writing down their name?

599
00:27:52,262 --> 00:27:55,479
- It has to be one of these six members.
- I understand.

600
00:27:56,996 --> 00:28:01,267
[Nervous two members with a
high probability of being eliminated.]

601
00:28:03,206 --> 00:28:05,301
[Kwang Soo's vote]

602
00:28:05,706 --> 00:28:07,697
- Let's do this together, Kwang Soo.
- Yes, Ha Ha.

603
00:28:09,567 --> 00:28:11,830
[Ha Ha]

604
00:28:11,831 --> 00:28:14,289
[After what he just said,
he votes for Ha Ha...]

605
00:28:17,672 --> 00:28:20,141
[Blank Ji's vote is...]

606
00:28:20,142 --> 00:28:21,669
[One vote for Kwang Soo.]

607
00:28:22,290 --> 00:28:26,689
[Yoo Hyuk's vote goes to...]

608
00:28:26,690 --> 00:28:29,309
[Kwang Soo!]

609
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,941
[Current standing-
Ha Ha:1 vs. Kwang Soo:2.]

610
00:28:38,814 --> 00:28:41,653
[Gary's vote goes to Ha Ha.]

611
00:28:45,449 --> 00:28:47,015
[You know, right?]

612
00:28:50,653 --> 00:28:53,401
[Immediately votes for Kwang Soo.]

613
00:28:53,402 --> 00:28:55,061
I have to survive.

614
00:28:55,732 --> 00:28:57,318
Oh my, it's so hot.

615
00:28:57,319 --> 00:29:00,008
[Current standing-
Ha Ha:2 vs. Kwang Soo:3.]

616
00:29:00,651 --> 00:29:04,234
[Likely candidates to be eliminated
giving Hyo Joo the eye.]

617
00:29:04,235 --> 00:29:05,982
It's going to be a fall out!

618
00:29:05,983 --> 00:29:07,142
Fall out!

619
00:29:07,143 --> 00:29:08,188
Cross!

620
00:29:10,176 --> 00:29:11,679
Hyo Joo's made up her mind.

621
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,663
Leg tripping... Cross!

622
00:29:14,228 --> 00:29:16,386
[Hyo Joo's vote...]

623
00:29:16,387 --> 00:29:19,191
[Goes to Ha Ha!]

624
00:29:20,731 --> 00:29:22,825
Squabble and Bicker Cross!

625
00:29:24,527 --> 00:29:26,958
I've seen him betray one too many times.

626
00:29:27,603 --> 00:29:30,279
[Junho also votes for Ha Ha!]

627
00:29:31,951 --> 00:29:34,295
[Big-nosed Brother votes for Kwang Soo.]

628
00:29:38,985 --> 00:29:41,674
[Current standing-
Ha Ha:4 vs. Kwang Soo:4.]

629
00:29:41,675 --> 00:29:43,190
- Yours could be the deciding vote.
- Really?

630
00:29:43,191 --> 00:29:45,130
[Kkuk's vote could be the
deciding factor!]

631
00:29:45,878 --> 00:29:46,940
Okay, I'm finished!

632
00:29:46,975 --> 00:29:50,146
[Who's name did he write down?]

633
00:29:52,344 --> 00:29:54,951
[Ha Ha!]

634
00:29:56,590 --> 00:29:58,883
Congratulations, Ha Ha!

635
00:30:00,244 --> 00:30:01,686
Congratulations!

636
00:30:01,687 --> 00:30:04,201
[Ha Ha is eliminated with five votes!]

637
00:30:04,202 --> 00:30:06,592
This is definitely Hyo Joo's.
She wrote down your name.

638
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:14,027
[Eliminated Ha Ha gets flipped over again.]

639
00:30:14,636 --> 00:30:17,972
[He really is being dragged away...]

640
00:30:17,973 --> 00:30:19,776
I won't be killed off this easily!

641
00:30:23,378 --> 00:30:26,438
[No... you won't die.]

642
00:30:29,432 --> 00:30:31,094

[He is... making his moves.]

[Jung Woo Sung's mission.]

646
00:30:52,471 --> 00:30:54,556
You're the Grim Reaper of Revenge.

647

<i>[In the order that the eliminated one wishes,
oust every member of Running Man in revenge.]</i>

648

<i>[You'll have the use of all 108 CCTV cameras
that are installed throughout the building.]</i>

649
00:31:07,703 --> 00:31:09,425
[This is... the surveillance room.]

650
00:31:10,287 --> 00:31:13,465
<i>There are a total of 108 CCTV cameras
installed throughout the SBS building</i>

651
00:31:13,466 --> 00:31:17,253
<i>that you can use to locate the whereabouts
of each member of the Running Man team.</i>

652
00:31:17,254 --> 00:31:21,089
<i>Use it well...
and you'll find it a very useful tool.</i>

653
00:31:24,692 --> 00:31:25,848
<i>However...</i>

654
00:31:25,849 --> 00:31:31,032
<i>Because Running Man members assume
that their positions are being exposed...</i>

655
00:31:31,033 --> 00:31:33,665
<i>they will go around turning off
each of the CCTV cameras.</i>

656
00:31:33,959 --> 00:31:36,235
<i>And once all the CCTV cameras
have been turned off</i>

657
00:31:36,236 --> 00:31:39,456
<i>the members then come after you
to eliminate your name tag.</i>

660
00:31:48,887 --> 00:31:51,869
[Who will be the second member
to get eliminated?]

661
00:31:52,318 --> 00:31:53,992
first vote is for Lee Kwang Soo.

662
00:31:53,993 --> 00:31:55,358
Kwang Soo.

663
00:31:55,869 --> 00:31:57,337
Lee Kwang Soo.

664
00:31:57,606 --> 00:31:59,192
'Kwang Soo, I'm sorry.'

665
00:31:59,794 --> 00:32:01,734
Kwang Soo, Kwang Soo, Kwang Soo.

666
00:32:02,358 --> 00:32:05,499
[By a unanimous vote,
Kwang Soo is eliminated!]

667
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:08,045
- How did that happen?
- Is this even allowed?

668
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:11,000
Don't you think this is too much?

669
00:32:11,818 --> 00:32:13,088
Seriously.

670
00:32:14,476 --> 00:32:16,048
- Yeah...
- Ha Ha.

671
00:32:16,317 --> 00:32:18,778
- I was so lonely here by myself.
- I can't believe it.

672
00:32:19,074 --> 00:32:23,518
After what they just put me through,
isn't doing this again too much?

673
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:26,603
To be perfectly honest,
have you ever seen a traitor nicer than us?

674
00:32:26,604 --> 00:32:28,238
And we're so docile too.

675
00:32:28,239 --> 00:32:30,513
It's probably not good for us to be
as nice as we are.

676
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:33,767
Lee Kwang Soo has been eliminated
during the second round.

677
00:32:34,989 --> 00:32:36,216
What's that?

678
00:32:36,217 --> 00:32:37,312
What is that?

679
00:32:38,072 --> 00:32:40,229
[Huh?]

680
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:42,275
[Death note?]

681
00:32:42,276 --> 00:32:44,273
<i>Do you feel unjust
from having been eliminated?</i>

682
00:32:44,557 --> 00:32:46,955
<i>Don't you feel overwhelmed by rage?</i>

683
00:32:47,234 --> 00:32:50,644
<i>In your answer is yes, then
who do you think is responsible for it?</i>

684
00:32:50,645 --> 00:32:54,743
[Write down the name of the person
that filled them with rage?]

685
00:32:54,744 --> 00:32:57,609
<i>Who's name tag do you want to eliminate
the most if you were able to?</i>

686
00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:01,414
<i>Write down the names of today's
Running Man members that you</i>

687
00:33:01,415 --> 00:33:06,265
<i>want to oust in the order that you want
to eliminate in this notebook.</i>

688
00:33:06,266 --> 00:33:08,603
[In the order that they want ousted?]

689
00:33:08,604 --> 00:33:11,939

eliminated in the death note!]

690
00:33:12,572 --> 00:33:14,512
[The time is here...]

691
00:33:16,609 --> 00:33:19,365
[SBS Mokdong Office]

692
00:33:25,042 --> 00:33:28,521
[Van carrying the eliminated members
is the first to arrive.]

693
00:33:29,893 --> 00:33:31,494
Why are you...

694
00:33:31,495 --> 00:33:33,385
I have a death note in my hands.

695
00:33:33,779 --> 00:33:38,094
But... wait, what's your name?
I'm writing it in my death note.

696
00:33:38,095 --> 00:33:42,353
- Wait... but we've been brought back to life.
- This is the type of people we are.

697
00:33:42,621 --> 00:33:44,614
This is really making me feel disappointed.

698
00:33:45,596 --> 00:33:47,980
We're... we're not out of
this game yet.

699
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:57,755
<i>The eliminated members are now
entering the building.</i>

700
00:33:59,335 --> 00:34:01,743
Why am I feeling so nervous?

701
00:34:05,352 --> 00:34:07,335
<i>You may open the door
and go on inside.</i>

702
00:34:07,336 --> 00:34:09,903
What's going on in there?

703
00:34:18,468 --> 00:34:20,462
Wait, wait... wait a second.

704
00:34:23,439 --> 00:34:25,299
Isn't that... Jung Woo Sung?

705
00:34:26,233 --> 00:34:27,492
It is, isn't it?

706
00:34:27,816 --> 00:34:30,329
- Did you see his profile?
- It could just be someone who resembles him.

707
00:34:31,617 --> 00:34:32,855
It could be Dong Wan.

708
00:34:34,466 --> 00:34:35,616
Dong Wan, is it you?

709
00:34:37,172 --> 00:34:39,022
Hey, I think it is him.

710
00:34:39,023 --> 00:34:40,591
Woo Sung... Is it you, Woo Sung?

711
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,516
[Everyone...]

712
00:34:46,517 --> 00:34:48,633
[Hello!]

713
00:34:53,243 --> 00:34:56,313
[The real Jung Woo Sung right
in front of their eyes!]

714
00:34:56,314 --> 00:34:58,052
This is so amazing!

715
00:34:58,053 --> 00:34:59,824
[Automatically slipping into
their fan mode.]

716
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:01,483
Seriously...

717
00:35:01,484 --> 00:35:03,575
- You're so much better than Hyo Joo!
- Really?

718
00:35:03,576 --> 00:35:06,136
- Really?
- Yes.

719
00:35:06,855 --> 00:35:09,396
I don't know what to do with myself!

720
00:35:09,397 --> 00:35:11,396
Woo Sung... can I call you sometime?

721
00:35:11,397 --> 00:35:13,173
No, don't call me.

722
00:35:14,284 --> 00:35:16,485
[Overflowing with wit and charm
right from the get-go.]

723
00:35:17,411 --> 00:35:19,951
- He refused right away.
- No, please don't call me.

724
00:35:19,952 --> 00:35:23,662
- Wow... seriously.
- I feel like I'm in a movie right now!

725
00:35:23,663 --> 00:35:25,767
- I saw this in his movie!
- 'The Beat'!

726
00:35:26,619 --> 00:35:29,298
Where are you?
Where are you right now?

727
00:35:34,046 --> 00:35:39,754
[Hit movie from 1997, 'Beat'...
Do you remember the movie?]

728
00:35:41,518 --> 00:35:43,275
[Demonstrating it himself.]

729
00:35:43,275 --> 00:35:44,825
You have to bend the neck like this.

730
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:48,016
[There you go trying to imitate him again...]

731
00:35:48,017 --> 00:35:49,900
I do this more than the motorcycle
scene these days.

732
00:35:49,901 --> 00:35:51,306
[Instead of the motorcycle,
it's the horse action these days.]

733
00:35:51,307 --> 00:35:53,672
- Are you okay after that gunshot wound?
- Yes, I'm fine.

734
00:35:53,673 --> 00:35:55,593
- I took out all the bullets.
- He says he got all the bullets.

735
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:58,570
I took out all the bullets,
and came back to life.

736
00:35:58,571 --> 00:36:00,151
I came to life as another human being.

737
00:36:00,152 --> 00:36:02,552
But I have to be more than
just a regular human being today.

738
00:36:05,181 --> 00:36:07,278
- The way he talks is so cool.
- Really?

739
00:36:07,279 --> 00:36:08,884
- Thank you.
- He asks if we're being serious!

740
00:36:09,594 --> 00:36:11,631
I think he really likes hearing
things like that.

741
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:13,637
Yes, I really like it.

742
00:36:15,194 --> 00:36:17,395
You should've been on
a variety show sooner.

743
00:36:17,396 --> 00:36:20,346
- No, I've been too nervous to do that.
- This is your first time on a variety show?

744
00:36:20,347 --> 00:36:21,982
I was so nervous to come on this show.

745
00:36:21,983 --> 00:36:24,979
This is the first time that I've been nervous
enough for my heart to beat like this.

746
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:26,479
- Really?
- It gave me the flutters.

747
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:29,880
I've always heard so much about Running Man,
and it sounded like fun.

748
00:36:29,881 --> 00:36:32,684
I thought it would be so fun and exciting
to meet all of you

749
00:36:32,685 --> 00:36:33,882
but I wondered if I'd be good on the show.

750
00:36:33,883 --> 00:36:36,518
Just the fact that you came on the show
is a great honor to us.

751
00:36:36,519 --> 00:36:38,255
- What character are you playing today?
- Can you tell us?

752
00:36:38,256 --> 00:36:40,841
I'm the death note problem solver.

753
00:36:40,842 --> 00:36:44,491
[Jung Woo Sung,
he's the death note problem solver?]

754
00:36:44,492 --> 00:36:47,889
In this SBS Mokdong office building...

755
00:36:48,038 --> 00:36:51,992
there are a total of 108 CCTV cameras
starting from the parking garage

756
00:36:51,993 --> 00:36:55,282
all the way up to the rooftop
where the helipad is.

757
00:36:59,099 --> 00:37:04,687
[Total of 108 CCTV cameras placed
throughout SBS office building.]

758
00:37:06,143 --> 00:37:08,985
[Three levels from the garage up to the roof
are all under constant surveillance!]

759
00:37:09,848 --> 00:37:15,067
We can use those CCTV cameras to
find the Running Man members.

760
00:37:15,102 --> 00:37:19,421
But if the Running Man members get rid of
all those 108 CCTV cameras

761
00:37:19,422 --> 00:37:21,403
then Running Man members
can oust me.

762
00:37:21,404 --> 00:37:24,507
So once all these cameras are out,
they can then start to attack you?

763
00:37:24,508 --> 00:37:26,230
- Yes, that's correct.
- But if we eliminate them before that...

764
00:37:26,265 --> 00:37:28,830
That's why we have to find them before
that happens and quickly eliminate them.

765
00:37:28,831 --> 00:37:31,166
- We?
- Is the three of us are a team?

766
00:37:31,166 --> 00:37:35,571
In exchange for me taking your lists in
the death notes to carry out your wish...

767
00:37:35,572 --> 00:37:38,886
both of you need to join me
in carrying out this mission.

768
00:37:40,008 --> 00:37:42,316
- We have a team uniform!
- I have a good feeling about this.

769
00:37:42,317 --> 00:37:44,083
I feel like a Grim Reaper too.

770
00:37:44,084 --> 00:37:45,939
I'm going to change into this right now.

771
00:37:46,391 --> 00:37:50,094
- Wow...
- I love you, Jung Woo Sung!

772
00:37:50,095 --> 00:37:52,865
Jung Woo Sung!
Jung Woo Sung!

773
00:37:52,866 --> 00:37:54,701
You've still got it, Jung Woo Sung!

774
00:37:54,702 --> 00:37:57,027
- You have to do it with us.
- What? Together?

775
00:37:57,028 --> 00:37:58,987
- We're a team. One, two, three, four!
- Okay.

776
00:38:01,579 --> 00:38:03,064
You've still got it, Jung Woo Sung!

777
00:38:03,065 --> 00:38:05,656
[Louder!]

778
00:38:05,657 --> 00:38:07,260
You've still got it, Jung Woo Sung!

779
00:38:09,624 --> 00:38:12,199
I'm a member of his fan club,
Ha Dong Hoon.

780
00:38:12,611 --> 00:38:15,479
- I'm the Chairman of his fan club.
- I'm the Chairman!

781
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:17,582
- No, I'm the Chairman!
- Then let's duke it out.

782
00:38:17,583 --> 00:38:19,719
[A fight to take over
the fan club chairman position.]

783
00:38:20,441 --> 00:38:22,486
[I can't believe I'm teamed up
with these guys...]

784
00:38:23,598 --> 00:38:26,100
- Have you both completed your death notes?
- Yes.

785
00:38:26,101 --> 00:38:29,998
You two need to discuss how
the order of the death note will go.

786
00:38:29,999 --> 00:38:31,118
How should we do this?

787
00:38:31,118 --> 00:38:33,965
So in a way, Woo Sung will have to do
as we order him to do?

788
00:38:34,310 --> 00:38:37,700
No, no. Not order.
Choose your words wisely.

789
00:38:38,332 --> 00:38:41,816
You're asking the Grim Reaper for a favor.
Right?

790
00:38:45,071 --> 00:38:47,204
What did you say?
I have good hearing.

791
00:38:47,806 --> 00:38:51,098
- He just said that we're your minions!
- No, I didn't!

792
00:38:51,133 --> 00:38:52,937
He's lying to you right now.

793
00:38:52,938 --> 00:38:55,710
- I'm the chairman of your fan club.
- No, I'm the chairman.

794
00:38:56,051 --> 00:38:58,551
I have good hearing,
and I tend to be pretty petty.

795
00:38:59,435 --> 00:39:01,632
- I'm going to keep my eye on you.
- I understand.

796
00:39:03,955 --> 00:39:05,548
Think about this.

797
00:39:05,549 --> 00:39:09,505
Remember when Jong Kook dragged out
ousting you awhile back?

798
00:39:09,506 --> 00:39:10,719
That really was hell.

799
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:13,352
When I think about it,
I'm reminded of Jae Suk at the pool.

800
00:39:13,353 --> 00:39:17,836
He kept coming after me and tormenting me
whenever he had anything in his hands.

801
00:39:18,118 --> 00:39:22,354
- So these two people need to feel that pain.
- Be cruel and keep them alive to the end?

802
00:39:22,355 --> 00:39:25,466
Let's be cruel about it.
We have to make them feel that fear.

803
00:39:25,467 --> 00:39:27,006
- Scare them out of their skin?
- Yes.

804
00:39:27,007 --> 00:39:29,045
We can do it because we
have Woo Sung here.

805
00:39:30,474 --> 00:39:36,000
Then we'll start ousting people
starting with the nicest one

806
00:39:36,001 --> 00:39:39,200
and as for the rest, make
them really know what real fear is.

807
00:39:39,590 --> 00:39:41,630
And be very cruel about the way
you rip off their name tags.

808
00:39:41,631 --> 00:39:44,052
Let's put Jae Suk at number seven.

809
00:39:44,053 --> 00:39:48,016
[Yoo Jae Suk lands the last position
in the order of the hunt.]

810
00:39:48,644 --> 00:39:51,453
Should we put Jong Kook at five or six?
Here's what I think.

811
00:39:51,454 --> 00:39:53,216
- How about Hyo Joo?
- Okay.

812
00:39:53,217 --> 00:39:55,710
Han Hyo Joo.
Remember what I told you about her?

813
00:39:55,711 --> 00:39:57,725
I can't even attempt to
trip her anymore.

814
00:39:58,474 --> 00:40:01,124
Have you and Hyo Joo ever played
lovers in a movie or anything?

815
00:40:01,125 --> 00:40:02,101
- No, we haven't.
- You haven't.

816
00:40:02,102 --> 00:40:03,596
- She's the enemy.
- The enemy?

817
00:40:03,597 --> 00:40:06,036
[Hyo Joo lands the sixth position
without feeling any guilt or burden.]

818
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:10,452
Okay, next is Jong Kook.
Kim Jong Kook.

819
00:40:10,453 --> 00:40:13,169
You have to be careful
about the fifth person.

820
00:40:13,170 --> 00:40:15,779
And after that,
the order is no longer very important.

821
00:40:16,444 --> 00:40:19,360
Who should we put in the first place
for the first one to get ousted?

822
00:40:19,603 --> 00:40:21,614
- One, two, three.
- Ji Suk Jin!

823
00:40:21,615 --> 00:40:24,368
- We really are of the same mind.
- Of course.

824
00:40:24,369 --> 00:40:27,369
[The dignity of the race starter.]

825
00:40:27,370 --> 00:40:29,877
He's like a fish in the pond.

826
00:40:30,155 --> 00:40:32,077
You'll catch him the moment you
dip your fishing pole in the water.

827
00:40:32,078 --> 00:40:34,541
Okay, Junho?
Since he is the guest, after all.

828
00:40:35,682 --> 00:40:38,850
- Gary is strong too.
- Yeah, Gary is strong.

829
00:40:38,851 --> 00:40:41,709
[The death note's order is
now complete!]

830
00:40:41,710 --> 00:40:42,897
Since this is his first time

831
00:40:42,898 --> 00:40:44,697
he needs to know what it's like
to rip off the name tag.

832
00:40:44,698 --> 00:40:46,981
- Want to know what it's like to rip it off?
- If he rips it off, you're ousted!

833
00:40:46,982 --> 00:40:48,827
No, it's okay for him to do this.

834
00:40:48,828 --> 00:40:50,344
[In one swipe?]

835
00:40:50,345 --> 00:40:52,224
- You got it.
- Did I do it right?

836
00:40:52,225 --> 00:40:53,982
But I think you need to be more
snappy about it.

837
00:40:53,983 --> 00:40:56,536
If you'll take a look,
see how I'm grabbing this corner?

838
00:40:56,537 --> 00:40:59,518
When someone grabs ours like this,
do you know what our habitual reaction is?

839
00:40:59,519 --> 00:41:00,928
We turn away like this.

840
00:41:00,929 --> 00:41:02,832
[Demonstrating evasion skills that
are now embedded in their bodies.]

841
00:41:02,833 --> 00:41:05,983
So when you want to rip it off,
lightly grab them and snap it off.

842
00:41:05,984 --> 00:41:07,926
- See?
- So that they can't turn away.

843
00:41:07,927 --> 00:41:09,749
[Point- Prohibit them from turning,
and snap off their name tag.]

844
00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:11,126
Want to give it a try?

845
00:41:12,516 --> 00:41:13,848
You sneak up on someone.

846
00:41:16,108 --> 00:41:17,176
And next.

847
00:41:19,966 --> 00:41:23,200
[Skilled enough for him
to jump right into action!]

848
00:41:23,201 --> 00:41:25,706
What would you do if I grabbed
you right here?

849
00:41:25,707 --> 00:41:27,407
That's right.
Grab him.

850
00:41:32,004 --> 00:41:34,908
[Matrix?]

851
00:41:36,199 --> 00:41:38,380
You're good.
You're ready for this.

852
00:41:38,381 --> 00:41:40,763
- We...
- We...

853
00:41:40,764 --> 00:41:43,244
Hang on a second.
I should be saying it first.

854
00:41:44,094 --> 00:41:45,946
- I'm the Grim Reaper.
- Okay, I understand.

855
00:41:45,947 --> 00:41:47,376
- I'm the Grim Reaper.
- Okay.

856
00:41:47,377 --> 00:41:48,963
- We!
- We.

857
00:41:48,964 --> 00:41:50,807
We Cross!

858
00:41:54,006 --> 00:41:56,248
- How can I not laugh at that?
- Wow, it's so hot in here.

859
00:41:56,249 --> 00:42:01,462
[Death note Grim Reaper.
His hunting starts now.]

860
00:42:02,545 --> 00:42:06,086
[Running Man limousine arrives at
the SBS office soon thereafter.]

861
00:42:07,226 --> 00:42:08,581
Our company.

862
00:42:08,582 --> 00:42:09,910
Our company?

863
00:42:12,032 --> 00:42:16,492
[Not even fathoming in their wildest dreams
that a Grim Reaper is awaiting their arrival.]

864
00:42:17,964 --> 00:42:21,771
- This is where I became a victor.
- Stop talking about that.

865
00:42:21,772 --> 00:42:24,127
How many times
are you going to talk about that?

866
00:42:24,128 --> 00:42:26,228
- I haven't talked about it that much.
- That happened so long ago.

867
00:42:26,229 --> 00:42:28,284
- What are you talking about?
- This is your final mission.

868
00:42:28,582 --> 00:42:30,679
The survival games that
you've been playing thus far...

869
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:33,981
those games were played to determine
who was going to be eliminated.

870
00:42:33,982 --> 00:42:38,216
<i>The real survivor race starts now.</i>

871
00:42:38,896 --> 00:42:40,626
Your current locations...

872
00:42:40,874 --> 00:42:45,911
are being exposed to Grim Reaper of Revenge,
who has a bell attached to his shoes.

873
00:42:47,726 --> 00:42:50,700
Through the usage of 108 CCTV cameras

874
00:42:50,701 --> 00:42:54,210
he is currently surveying
every move that you guys are making.

875
00:42:55,189 --> 00:42:58,704
The Grim Reaper must follow the
order of revenge that's been designated

876
00:42:59,156 --> 00:43:02,246
and must start ousting you one by one
in the order of that list.

877
00:43:02,247 --> 00:43:04,192
- What do you mean?
- How was that order made?

878
00:43:04,193 --> 00:43:05,256
Eliminated in an order?

879
00:43:05,257 --> 00:43:07,682
- What have we done to deserve this?
- What have we done?

880
00:43:07,683 --> 00:43:13,188
But you don't have to just sit back
and just be had by the Grim Reaper.

881
00:43:13,628 --> 00:43:18,980
If you turn off all the 108 CCTV cameras
that are placed throughout the building...

882
00:43:19,015 --> 00:43:20,661
- 108 cameras?
- What?

883
00:43:21,014 --> 00:43:23,940
Starting in the lower garage level
going up to the twenty second floor.

884
00:43:23,941 --> 00:43:25,090
How many would that make per person?

885
00:43:25,091 --> 00:43:30,647
If you turn off all 108 of those cameras,
then the bell comes off of the Grim Reaper.

886
00:43:30,648 --> 00:43:33,649
And that's when you can also start
attacking the Grim Reaper.

887
00:43:33,649 --> 00:43:37,675
- We have to work together on this.
- Yes, we're not each other's enemy.

888
00:43:37,676 --> 00:43:39,157
Let's each take a section then.

889
00:43:39,158 --> 00:43:41,289
[Right before the mission is launched.]

890
00:43:42,707 --> 00:43:46,196
[The Grim Reaper is also starting
to make his move!]

891
00:43:47,490 --> 00:43:49,817
Woo Sung, let's win this race and
we can all spend the night at your house.

892
00:43:49,818 --> 00:43:52,987
I like it. Let's have a garden party with
just us three at your house.

893
00:43:52,988 --> 00:43:55,366
- You like going to someone else's home?
- Let's have a party.

894
00:43:55,529 --> 00:43:57,183
Yes, I do.

895
00:44:00,321 --> 00:44:05,403
Three, two, one.
You have no time. Get started.

896
00:44:05,404 --> 00:44:07,718
- Do we know what the order of that list is?
- Do we just get going?

897
00:44:09,570 --> 00:44:11,546
- Start!
- Hurry. Go, go, go!

898
00:44:11,547 --> 00:44:14,134
Let us know right away when you
locate Suk Jin on the camera.

899
00:44:14,135 --> 00:44:18,278
[One goes out to act as bait,
while the other stays behind to keep watch.]

900
00:44:18,279 --> 00:44:21,604
- What floor are they starting off at?
- They're probably coming up from first.

901
00:44:21,605 --> 00:44:24,318
[Only Woo Jung, the Grim Reaper has the
power to actually eliminate the name tag.]

902
00:44:24,319 --> 00:44:28,544
Eighth floor is the level where the
two buildings connect with a walkway.

903
00:44:28,545 --> 00:44:30,234
- Eighth floor.
- Okay, let's go to the eighth floor.

904
00:44:31,258 --> 00:44:34,537
- These bells are no joke.
- Right? Aren't they nerve wrecking?

905
00:44:35,060 --> 00:44:37,056
The people being chased are terrified
to hear the sound of those bells.

906
00:44:38,728 --> 00:44:40,397
Where's Suk Jin?
Suk Jin...

907
00:44:40,875 --> 00:44:42,859
Suk Jin.
Suk Jin...

908
00:44:44,108 --> 00:44:46,131
Suk Jin, Suk Jin...

909
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:48,922
Where's Suk Jin?
Suk Jin...

910
00:44:49,778 --> 00:44:52,551
All the members are now...
Oh, they're now just coming in.

911
00:44:53,479 --> 00:44:55,034
Okay, first floor.

912
00:44:55,035 --> 00:44:56,508
Okay, there's Suk Jin.

913
00:44:56,509 --> 00:44:59,997
- How about the garage?
- We should check the helipad first.

914
00:44:59,998 --> 00:45:02,723
I'm positive there's one up there.
They told us about it too.

915
00:45:02,758 --> 00:45:03,823
Isn't that one?

916
00:45:04,862 --> 00:45:06,800
[CCTV camera is discovered!]

917
00:45:06,801 --> 00:45:09,031
- Isn't that one?
- I'll take care of the helipad.

918
00:45:09,032 --> 00:45:10,667
There's one over here.
Look, one over here.

919
00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:13,602
- There it is.
- I knew there would be one.

920
00:45:13,603 --> 00:45:17,008
[Junho turns off the one behind
the information desk.]

921
00:45:17,009 --> 00:45:19,204
- He got one
- Nice, Junho.

922
00:45:19,205 --> 00:45:21,125
- Oh my God.
- You did good.

923
00:45:21,126 --> 00:45:22,983
Junho's pretty good.

924
00:45:24,144 --> 00:45:26,890
[One off]

925
00:45:26,891 --> 00:45:29,029
- I'm going up to the seventh floor.
- I'll go up to the 21st.

926
00:45:29,030 --> 00:45:31,483
Didn't he say earlier that there's an
order to the elimination?

927
00:45:31,484 --> 00:45:33,076
There's one here.

928
00:45:33,077 --> 00:45:34,740
- There's one here.
- You have to block it off.

929
00:45:34,741 --> 00:45:36,210
Number 15.

930
00:45:37,116 --> 00:45:40,887
[Second CCTV camera turned off.]

931
00:45:41,638 --> 00:45:43,629
Okay, Suk Jin.
Suk Jin...

932
00:45:45,686 --> 00:45:47,220
Suk Jin turned one off.

933
00:45:48,894 --> 00:45:50,200
He's calling.
He's calling.

934
00:45:50,201 --> 00:45:51,516
Yeah, Ha Ha.

935
00:45:51,517 --> 00:45:54,276
<i>Suk Jin just turned off a camera
down on the first floor.</i>

936
00:45:54,277 --> 00:45:55,710
- First floor.
- First floor?

937
00:45:55,711 --> 00:45:57,432
<i>He's going to be getting on an elevator
from the first floor.</i>

938
00:45:57,433 --> 00:45:59,232
- He's going to get on an elevator?
- Yes.

939
00:45:59,233 --> 00:46:02,432
He's going to get on an elevator?
In that case, wait...

940
00:46:02,433 --> 00:46:04,665
They've already turned off
two cameras on the first floor.

941
00:46:04,666 --> 00:46:06,288
Okay, I got it.
I'm heading down to the first floor.

942
00:46:06,289 --> 00:46:07,747
Can you tell me what he said?

943
00:46:07,748 --> 00:46:11,235
Instead of going down, just wait a bit
since he's getting on the elevator.

944
00:46:11,236 --> 00:46:12,848
- Tell me what he's saying.
- Okay.

945
00:46:12,849 --> 00:46:15,015
I see you and Kwang Soo.
You're on the eighth floor?

946
00:46:15,016 --> 00:46:16,364
Yeah, we're on the eighth floor.

947
00:46:16,365 --> 00:46:18,789
Hang on a second.
I think they're all in the elevator.

948
00:46:19,279 --> 00:46:22,155
I'll call you as soon as I spot them.

949
00:46:22,156 --> 00:46:23,230
<i>Oh, okay.</i>

950
00:46:23,786 --> 00:46:26,561
I'm so nervous!
Being here is a huge responsibility.

951
00:46:26,562 --> 00:46:27,987
It's giving me a headache.

952
00:46:28,860 --> 00:46:31,389
Okay, they were just on the first floor...

953
00:46:31,390 --> 00:46:33,550
But what is that order exactly?

954
00:46:33,551 --> 00:46:37,930
[Running Man members are clueless to
the order designated in the death note.]

955
00:46:38,236 --> 00:46:41,640
- You can go up to the top level and...
- I'll go up to the 22nd floor.

956
00:46:41,641 --> 00:46:44,453
Let's do that and we can all
start going down the floors.

957
00:46:47,248 --> 00:46:48,666
There's one.

958
00:46:48,667 --> 00:46:51,093
There's one right there.
I just need to turn it off, right?

959
00:46:51,094 --> 00:46:52,261
Hello.

960
00:46:52,913 --> 00:46:54,410
We need to turn off cameras
like these, right?

961
00:46:57,158 --> 00:46:58,439
I see one over there.

962
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:08,939
[Turning off the ones they see
one by one.]

963
00:47:12,816 --> 00:47:13,914
There's one.

964
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:17,705
They have it hidden everywhere.
Number 98.

965
00:47:18,436 --> 00:47:20,608
Who's that?
Who's on the 21st floor?

966
00:47:20,615 --> 00:47:22,267
Ah, it's Ji Hyo.

967
00:47:22,963 --> 00:47:25,582
[Gary is making his rounds on
the 19th floor.]

968
00:47:28,610 --> 00:47:30,856
It's Song Ji Hyo.
Song Ji Hyo's on the 21st floor.

969
00:47:32,071 --> 00:47:34,596
I just need to find Suk Jin.
but I can't find him anywhere.

970
00:47:34,597 --> 00:47:39,744
[They're finding the cameras
much faster than anticipated.]

971
00:47:41,727 --> 00:47:43,567
I don't see him anywhere!

972
00:47:43,915 --> 00:47:46,232
Where is Suk Jin?
Is he hiding somewhere?

973
00:47:49,898 --> 00:47:53,340
[Big-nosed Brother finally arrives
on the 22nd floor.]

974
00:47:58,324 --> 00:47:59,891
Ji Hyo.

975
00:48:01,046 --> 00:48:02,608
Woo Sung, Ji Hyo...

976
00:48:02,609 --> 00:48:05,510
[There he is!]

977
00:48:05,511 --> 00:48:08,973
[First target, Suk Jin is discovered
on the 22nd floor!]

978
00:48:08,974 --> 00:48:10,025
Ji Suk Jin is on 22nd floor.

979
00:48:10,467 --> 00:48:13,423
- Ji Suk Jin is on 22nd floor.
- 22nd floor!

980
00:48:13,999 --> 00:48:18,662
[Message received from the surveillance room.
Up to the 22nd floor!]

981
00:48:18,663 --> 00:48:20,437
- What about me?
- 22nd floor. He's up on the 22nd floor!

982
00:48:20,438 --> 00:48:21,567
You have to take me with you.

983
00:48:21,568 --> 00:48:22,999
Ji Suk Jin is on 22nd floor.

984
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,357
<i>Ji Suk Jin is on 22nd floor.</i>

985
00:48:24,358 --> 00:48:25,363
Okay.

986
00:48:25,364 --> 00:48:29,369
[Their second target, Ji Hyo
is on the 21st floor!]

987
00:48:29,962 --> 00:48:31,695
Woo Sung, he's on the 22nd floor.

988
00:48:35,171 --> 00:48:36,493
You can't go off by yourself!

989
00:48:37,027 --> 00:48:39,379
They're turning off all of them.
This is a big problem.

990
00:48:39,879 --> 00:48:43,234
You have to hurry.
And Song Ji Hyo's on the 21st floor.

991
00:48:43,546 --> 00:48:45,539
- Song Ji Hyo is on the 21st floor?
- Yes.

992
00:48:45,540 --> 00:48:48,311
So go one floor down as soon as
you oust Ji Suk Jin.

993
00:48:49,238 --> 00:48:52,194
If it's taking too long, then use the stairs.
All the cameras are being shut off.

994
00:48:52,195 --> 00:48:54,329
Hyo Joo's on the 19th floor,
and she's turning everything off.

995
00:48:54,330 --> 00:48:55,901
- We're heading off to 22nd.
- Okay.

996
00:48:56,481 --> 00:48:59,839
- Ten CCTV's are currently out.
- Ten? Already?

997
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:01,717
Ten CCTV's are currently out.

998
00:49:02,375 --> 00:49:03,668
You're keeping me out of the loop.

999
00:49:03,669 --> 00:49:06,033
He can't call both of us at the same time.

1000
00:49:06,034 --> 00:49:07,874
- That's why he just kept telling me.
- Okay.

1001
00:49:07,875 --> 00:49:10,666
I'm sure he wants to tell you too
as much as you want to hear it.

1002
00:49:10,667 --> 00:49:13,124
I'm sure he wants to tell you.
But let's first get Ji Suk Jin...

1003
00:49:13,125 --> 00:49:16,391
- Can we discuss it first?
- There's no time for that.

1004
00:49:16,392 --> 00:49:20,442
- And Song Ji Hyo's on the 21st floor.
- We can go down right after.

1005
00:49:24,991 --> 00:49:26,251
Bye.

1006
00:49:28,108 --> 00:49:30,070
I knew there would be one up here.

1007
00:49:33,631 --> 00:49:36,015
Jong Kook.
Jong Kook's up on the roof!

1008
00:49:39,039 --> 00:49:42,231
- 20 CCTV's are currently out.
- 20 of them already?

1009
00:49:42,232 --> 00:49:45,161
- 20 CCTV's are currently out.
- Already?

1010
00:49:46,163 --> 00:49:49,281
You have no time for the elevator.
You have to run up there right now.

1011
00:49:49,282 --> 00:49:51,254
He says we have no time and
that we have to run up there.

1012
00:49:51,255 --> 00:49:53,393
Ha Ha, we've arrived on the 22nd floor.

1013
00:49:53,394 --> 00:49:55,397
- Stop taking so long!
- Where's Suk Jin?

1014
00:49:55,398 --> 00:49:57,433
You have to get up to the 22nd floor!

1015
00:49:57,434 --> 00:49:59,264
We just got to the 22nd floor.
Where on the 22nd floor?

1016
00:49:59,265 --> 00:50:02,252
[In the meantime, the Running Man members
are busy turning off all the cameras.]

1017
00:50:02,938 --> 00:50:05,677
Wow, these guys are
annihilating the cameras.

1018
00:50:08,183 --> 00:50:11,627
Wow, why do I feel so nervous?

1019
00:50:11,628 --> 00:50:13,330
I just don't know what's
going to happen.

1020
00:50:13,677 --> 00:50:18,648
[Not even guessing in his wildest dreams
that he's the first one to be ousted.]

1021
00:50:19,764 --> 00:50:20,881
Who's that?

1022
00:50:21,584 --> 00:50:25,410
[Death note Grim Reaper, Jung Woo Sung!]

1023
00:50:25,411 --> 00:50:27,508
[Their first target Ji Suk Jin
is within their sight!]

1024
00:50:27,509 --> 00:50:28,618
No!

1025
00:50:28,619 --> 00:50:30,247
Kwang Soo, what are you doing?

1026
00:50:32,867 --> 00:50:35,262
No, way, no way!
It's Jung Woo Sung!

1027
00:50:35,263 --> 00:50:36,989
- Stop!
- It's Jung Woo Sung!

1028
00:50:38,728 --> 00:50:40,501
Wait, wait.

1029
00:50:41,389 --> 00:50:44,032
[Eliminates the name tag
in the blink of an eye!]

1030
00:50:44,811 --> 00:50:48,450
[Grim Reaper Woo Sung succeeds at his
first hunt with lightning fast speed!]

1031
00:50:52,233 --> 00:50:53,998
You're out.

1032
00:50:55,060 --> 00:50:57,572
- Are you really going to be like this?
- Kwang Soo!

1033
00:50:57,990 --> 00:50:59,884
I've finally got my revenge!

1034
00:51:01,397 --> 00:51:02,656
I'm the first?

1035
00:51:05,373 --> 00:51:08,887
<i>Ji Suk Jin, out.
Ji Suk Jin, out.</i>

1036
00:51:10,725 --> 00:51:12,175
<i>Ji Suk Jin, out.</i>

1037
00:51:12,176 --> 00:51:14,080
It's finally starting.
It's starting.

1038
00:51:15,245 --> 00:51:17,528
[Running Man members unaware of
the reason behind the order.]

1039
00:51:17,529 --> 00:51:21,898
[Their anxiety level is growing
more and more.]

1040
00:51:22,624 --> 00:51:24,139
- Oh my goodness!
- You scared me!

1041
00:51:25,131 --> 00:51:27,940
- Gary, why was Suk Jin the first ousted?
- I don't know.

1042
00:51:27,941 --> 00:51:29,733
I'm so scared right now.

1043
00:51:30,192 --> 00:51:33,368
You have to keep a close eye on things.
But Suk Jin? How is that order working?

1044
00:51:33,368 --> 00:51:34,592
I have no idea myself.

1045
00:51:34,593 --> 00:51:36,792
- How do you think the order is going?
- Is it by age?

1046
00:51:36,793 --> 00:51:38,073
What?

1047
00:51:38,228 --> 00:51:39,998
In that case, I'm next.

1048
00:51:40,515 --> 00:51:42,525
- That would make me next.
- I'm scared to death right now.

1049
00:51:42,526 --> 00:51:45,370
[Who determined the order?]

1050
00:51:56,179 --> 00:51:59,249
[Grim Reaper off to hunt down
his second target, Ji Hyo.]

1051
00:51:59,250 --> 00:52:00,758
Call him.

1052
00:52:00,759 --> 00:52:02,658
Make sure Song Ji Hyo is on
the 21st floor.

1053
00:52:32,473 --> 00:52:34,392
I heard the bells ringing.

1054
00:52:35,073 --> 00:52:36,789
I heard the bells.

1055
00:52:36,790 --> 00:52:38,685
[Extreme level of anxiety after
having heard the bells ringing.]

1056
00:52:42,685 --> 00:52:46,884
I have to keep going down and
find the security cameras.

1057
00:52:47,419 --> 00:52:50,523
But I'm too scared to go down.

1058
00:52:52,891 --> 00:52:55,218
I hate being scared like this.

1059
00:52:55,774 --> 00:52:58,019
I think someone is already on
the 17th floor.

1060
00:52:58,020 --> 00:53:00,119
Someone already did this floor.

1061
00:53:04,482 --> 00:53:06,966
Sorry for taking off on you like that.
I ran too far ahead of you.

1062
00:53:07,513 --> 00:53:10,359
- Woo Sung, what happened?
- Ha Ha, we ousted Suk Jin.

1063
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:12,583
Hey, sixth floor!
Song Ji Hyo's on the sixth floor!

1064
00:53:12,584 --> 00:53:14,292
- Hurry! Sixth floor!
- What floor?

1065
00:53:14,293 --> 00:53:15,994
- Sixth floor!
- Sixth floor?

1066
00:53:15,995 --> 00:53:18,376
Sixth floor.
She's on the sixth floor!

1067
00:53:18,377 --> 00:53:20,791
- Okay, sixth floor!
- Hurry up and run!

1068
00:53:21,227 --> 00:53:22,861
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

1069
00:53:23,231 --> 00:53:25,871
[Much of the camera screens have
already been shut off.]

1070
00:53:26,198 --> 00:53:28,866
Wow, I can't believe I saw Ji Hyo's
face like that.

1071
00:53:33,289 --> 00:53:37,019
[Ace Ji Hyo searching the sixth floor
for any hidden security cameras.]

1072
00:53:43,083 --> 00:53:45,030
[Easily finds one to shut off.]

1073
00:53:46,450 --> 00:53:51,100
[She's not the Ace for no reason!]

1074
00:53:53,896 --> 00:53:56,902
Look at Ji Hyo. Look at Ji Hyo over here.
This is driving me crazy.

1075
00:54:02,807 --> 00:54:06,159
<i>Ji Hyo and Jae Suk are going around turning
off all the cameras. You have to move fast.</i>

1076
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:07,673
- Okay.
- We have no time.

1077
00:54:08,242 --> 00:54:10,198
Let's go this way.
Lets take the emergency stairs.

1078
00:54:10,810 --> 00:54:12,298
- You're going to run?
- Yeah.

1079
00:54:13,390 --> 00:54:16,527
[He's going to run down
ten flights of stairs?]

1080
00:54:17,066 --> 00:54:19,236
You should've waited for the elevator.

1081
00:54:19,237 --> 00:54:22,803
Kwang Soo, go back in there
and ride the elevator down.

1082
00:54:22,804 --> 00:54:24,277
- Down to the sixth floor?
- Yeah.

1083
00:54:26,107 --> 00:54:28,271
- Will you be alright by yourself?
- Yeah.

1084
00:54:28,690 --> 00:54:31,897
This is too nerve wrecking,
and it's only the beginning.

1085
00:54:34,174 --> 00:54:37,813
- I'm on the 13th floor.
- 13? I told you to go down to the sixth!

1086
00:54:37,814 --> 00:54:39,960
- What are you doing?
- Woo Sung ran down to sixth on his own.

1087
00:54:39,961 --> 00:54:41,747
He kind of does what he wants.

1088
00:54:41,748 --> 00:54:44,644
What do you mean, does what he wants?
He's not even doing anything.

1089
00:54:44,645 --> 00:54:47,854
Ha Ha, I really...
have nothing to do here.

1090
00:54:48,190 --> 00:54:52,315
Ji Hyo's on the sixth floor.
Look, she's right there.

1091
00:54:53,396 --> 00:54:57,284
<i>She's going around turning them all off.
Ji Hyo's shutting them all of on the sixth.</i>

1092
00:54:57,734 --> 00:55:00,477
- I'm here.
- You have to move faster.

1093
00:55:02,684 --> 00:55:04,309
He hung up on me.

1094
00:55:06,812 --> 00:55:08,820
What kind of a Grim Reaper is this?

1095
00:55:11,742 --> 00:55:15,223
[Arriving on the sixth floor.
His search for Ji Hyo is on!]

1096
00:55:20,068 --> 00:55:22,835
[The sound of the bells ringing...]

1097
00:55:41,374 --> 00:55:43,779
[Succeeds at eliminating
his second target, Ji Hyo!]

1098
00:55:43,780 --> 00:55:44,976
Nice to see you.

1099
00:55:46,589 --> 00:55:48,988
[On my goodness!
Look who it is!]

1100
00:55:51,094 --> 00:55:53,997
I've got Song Ji Hyo.
Who's the third target?

1101
00:55:56,178 --> 00:55:57,493
Okay, Song Ji Hyo, out.

1102
00:55:58,113 --> 00:55:59,852
Okay, Gary.
Where's Gary?

1103
00:55:59,853 --> 00:56:01,068
[Find the third target, Gary!]

1104
00:56:01,411 --> 00:56:03,203
Where's Gary?
Where is he right now?

1105
00:56:10,949 --> 00:56:14,772
- Did you get any here?
- No, but I got everything on the 19th floor.

1106
00:56:14,773 --> 00:56:16,923
I wonder who ousted Suk Jin?

1107
00:56:16,924 --> 00:56:18,845
- I heard the bell sound.
- Really?

1108
00:56:18,846 --> 00:56:21,698
It was going after Kwang Soo.
Or was it not Kwang Soo?

1109
00:56:21,699 --> 00:56:23,232
I heard Kwang Soo's voice.

1110
00:56:23,233 --> 00:56:25,009
Ugh, that scared me!

1111
00:56:25,010 --> 00:56:26,893
That really scared me.

1112
00:56:26,894 --> 00:56:29,302
[Getting scared from having
seen their own VJ's.]

1113
00:56:29,303 --> 00:56:30,718
I'm going to go crazy.

1114
00:56:31,106 --> 00:56:34,092
[Pole dancing?]

1115
00:56:35,054 --> 00:56:37,858
- That really scared me.
- You said you saw Kwang Soo?

1116
00:56:38,162 --> 00:56:40,015
It was Kwang Soo's voice.

1117
00:56:40,016 --> 00:56:44,013
- Kwang Soo's wearing the bells?
- Kwang Soo's voice and the bell...

1118
00:56:44,284 --> 00:56:47,937
- I heard Kwang Soo's voice.
- Then the Grim Reaper...

1119
00:56:48,431 --> 00:56:50,996
- Then he's the Grim Reaper's minion.
- Kwang Soo is?

1120
00:56:50,997 --> 00:56:52,588
He's the spy.

1121
00:56:52,991 --> 00:56:55,686
Don't trust anyone.
Not anyone in this situation.

1122
00:56:59,259 --> 00:57:02,222
[Another ten years off her life.]

1123
00:57:03,207 --> 00:57:04,899
You have to be strong!

1124
00:57:05,648 --> 00:57:07,126
Stuff like this really scares me.

1125
00:57:07,127 --> 00:57:10,485
<i>Song Ji Hyo, out.
Song Ji Hyo, out.</i>

1126
00:57:10,486 --> 00:57:12,074
- No breaks for the girls?
- No.

1127
00:57:12,656 --> 00:57:16,401
Remember they said that we're getting
ousted in order?

1128
00:57:16,826 --> 00:57:20,773
Suk Jin was first to get ousted,
and if Ji Hyo was next...

1129
00:57:20,774 --> 00:57:22,637
I wonder what the order is?

1130
00:57:25,046 --> 00:57:28,977
I think it would be better to start
our search from the first floor.

1131
00:57:28,978 --> 00:57:31,108
- Okay.
- That may throw them off.

1132
00:57:31,109 --> 00:57:33,029
What?

1133
00:57:33,030 --> 00:57:34,451
Not a bad plan.

1134
00:57:38,108 --> 00:57:41,409
[Sound of bells ringing...]

1135
00:57:43,638 --> 00:57:44,894
What's that sound?

1136
00:57:48,626 --> 00:57:50,707
Hey, it's Jung Woo Sung!

1137
00:57:51,422 --> 00:57:52,998
- Hey, it's Jung Woo Sung!
- Wait.

1138
00:57:53,791 --> 00:57:55,229
[Panic]

1139
00:57:55,230 --> 00:57:56,435
It's Jung Woo Sung!

1140
00:57:57,397 --> 00:57:58,942
What is this?

1141
00:57:59,626 --> 00:58:01,619
- What is this? What's going on?
- Wait, hand on.

1142
00:58:01,620 --> 00:58:03,965
- What are you doing? What's going on?
- Hang on. Just wait.

1143
00:58:03,966 --> 00:58:06,329
- You startled me.
- I'm the Grim Reaper of Death.

1144
00:58:06,330 --> 00:58:07,535
- What did you say?
- I'm the Grim Reaper of Death.

1145
00:58:07,536 --> 00:58:09,149
Why are you the Grim Reaper of Death?
How are you the Grim Reaper of Death?

1146
00:58:09,150 --> 00:58:11,005
- Hang on a second and quiet down.
- Why?

1147
00:58:11,006 --> 00:58:13,728
Why are you doing this?
What are you doing here?

1148
00:58:13,729 --> 00:58:16,256
I'm on my mission.
You're on my side from now on.

1149
00:58:16,257 --> 00:58:17,981
- What?
- You're on my side from this moment on.

1150
00:58:17,982 --> 00:58:19,119
Why?

1151
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:22,847
You have to be on my side from now on,
and help me oust the other members.

1152
00:58:22,848 --> 00:58:26,761
I can pick just one person
to join my side.

1153
00:58:26,762 --> 00:58:28,637
And you're my one person.

1154
00:58:28,638 --> 00:58:31,775
So you will be helping me
oust the other members from now on.

1155
00:58:31,776 --> 00:58:33,487
[What is he saying?]

1156
00:58:33,488 --> 00:58:35,254
- Since you have the best skills...
- Wait a second.

1157
00:58:35,255 --> 00:58:37,027
You're looking way too serious.

1158
00:58:37,677 --> 00:58:40,427
- You look so serious.
- We have to catch them.

1159
00:58:40,428 --> 00:58:42,841
- You have to lure them over to me.
- How?

1160
00:58:43,505 --> 00:58:45,359
But I have to go take care
of the CCTV cameras.

1161
00:58:45,587 --> 00:58:49,828
You have to lure the others over to me
while you go around taking care of the CCTV.

1162
00:58:49,829 --> 00:58:53,044
[Lying to him about luring
the other members over to him.]

1163
00:58:53,494 --> 00:58:55,618
- Then am I the spy?
- We have to separate for now.

1164
00:58:55,619 --> 00:58:57,334
- We have to separate for now.
- But, wait...

1165
00:58:57,686 --> 00:58:59,008
Hello?

1166
00:58:59,864 --> 00:59:01,052
Jung Woo Sung...

1167
00:59:05,028 --> 00:59:09,753
[Feeling as though he's been
swept through by a storm.]

1168
00:59:10,870 --> 00:59:12,390
This is driving me crazy.

1169
00:59:12,798 --> 00:59:14,128
Wait...

1170
00:59:14,910 --> 00:59:18,246
[So what is it that I'm supposed
to be doing?]

1171
00:59:18,694 --> 00:59:20,144
I'm not sure.

1172
00:59:20,145 --> 00:59:22,702
Everything happened so suddenly.

1173
00:59:22,703 --> 00:59:24,314
[Unsure about what's going on from
having things happen so suddenly.]

1174
00:59:25,150 --> 00:59:28,174
I think I'm going to go around
turning off the cameras for now.

1175
00:59:30,183 --> 00:59:31,772
There's one.

1176
00:59:32,624 --> 00:59:33,931
Here it is.

1177
00:59:36,972 --> 00:59:40,972
The way I see it,
it must not be my turn yet.

1178
00:59:41,806 --> 00:59:43,890
Seeing how he didn't eliminate me...

1179
00:59:43,891 --> 00:59:45,702
it must not have been my turn yet.

1180
00:59:45,703 --> 00:59:48,056
If that wasn't the case,
I'm sure Woo Sung would've ousted me.

1181
00:59:48,057 --> 00:59:49,078
[Clever deduction!]

1182
00:59:51,336 --> 00:59:53,394
I think... Ah!

1183
00:59:54,038 --> 00:59:56,788
Even though I'm not the spy...

1184
00:59:57,246 --> 00:59:58,862
Don't you think, Gwon Yeol?

1185
01:00:00,002 --> 01:00:01,206
That's it.

1186
01:00:02,675 --> 01:00:06,176
He told me that on purpose because it's
not my turn to be ousted yet.

1187
01:00:06,177 --> 01:00:08,360
So that's why he said I was a spy.
It doesn't make any sense otherwise.

1188
01:00:08,395 --> 01:00:10,978
How would I know where to take them without
even a way to communicate with him?

1189
01:00:10,979 --> 01:00:13,046
He can't even tell me where
to bring them.

1190
01:00:13,047 --> 01:00:15,319
He doesn't even have a way
of communicating with me.

1191
01:00:15,319 --> 01:00:16,520
That's it.

1192
01:00:16,555 --> 01:00:19,604
He totally almost had me with that
serious look in his eyes.

1193
01:00:19,605 --> 01:00:22,077
I really thought for a second I was a spy.
But that's not really the case.

1194
01:00:22,078 --> 01:00:24,685
No, that's not it.
No need to worry, Gwon Yeol.

1195
01:00:27,461 --> 01:00:29,349
Hey, there's no need to worry
whatsoever.

1196
01:00:29,350 --> 01:00:30,725
That's what I think.

1197
01:00:33,776 --> 01:00:35,393
I have to hurry
and turn all these off.

1198
01:00:36,310 --> 01:00:39,479
[Running Man members rushing around
to turn off all the CCTV cameras.]

1199
01:00:40,101 --> 01:00:43,594
So someone is watching me right now
as I'm doing this?

1200
01:00:43,595 --> 01:00:44,766
Who is?

1201
01:00:45,110 --> 01:00:46,432
Someone is.

1202
01:00:52,539 --> 01:00:54,097
Number two!

1203
01:00:54,098 --> 01:00:56,577
[Mr. Capable heads down to the garage
after completing the rooftop.]

1204
01:00:56,578 --> 01:00:57,639
That one was number three.

1205
01:00:58,344 --> 01:00:59,968
He's on the third lower level.

1206
01:00:59,969 --> 01:01:02,782
<i>40 CCTV cameras are currently out.</i>

1207
01:01:04,106 --> 01:01:05,865
Jong Kook is on the third lower level

1208
01:01:05,866 --> 01:01:07,861
and they're driving me crazy by
going around turning everything off.

1209
01:01:07,862 --> 01:01:09,124
Really?

1210
01:01:10,488 --> 01:01:12,612
Where did Gary go?

1211
01:01:15,853 --> 01:01:19,921
[Oh!]

1212
01:01:20,904 --> 01:01:22,364
Gary!
He's on the first floor!

1213
01:01:24,482 --> 01:01:27,481
[Discovers Gary on the first floor.]

1214
01:01:29,708 --> 01:01:33,201
Who is he on the phone with?
What do I do? He's on the first floor!

1215
01:01:33,202 --> 01:01:36,024
I just saw Gary.
Who's he on the phone with?

1216
01:01:36,025 --> 01:01:37,467
This is driving me crazy.

1217
01:01:37,823 --> 01:01:39,201
What the heck!

1218
01:01:42,687 --> 01:01:46,931
[Giraffe also spots their third target,
Gary on the first floor.]

1219
01:01:48,141 --> 01:01:51,248
[Calls Grim Reaper,
Woo Sung right away.]

1220
01:01:52,261 --> 01:01:53,733
Yeah, talk to me.

1221
01:01:53,734 --> 01:01:55,521
<i>First floor.
He's on the first floor.</i>

1222
01:01:55,522 --> 01:01:57,630
Gary and Hyo Joo are on the first floor.

1223
01:01:57,631 --> 01:01:59,261
- Okay, I'm coming down.
- Okay.

1224
01:02:03,060 --> 01:02:05,083
You don't have time for the elevator.
You have to run down here.

1225
01:02:05,648 --> 01:02:08,349
I really think that Kwang Soo is a spy.

1226
01:02:08,350 --> 01:02:12,015
You really have to be cautious of
Kwang Soo and Ha Ha at all times.

1227
01:02:14,137 --> 01:02:15,437
Are they leaving?

1228
01:02:15,438 --> 01:02:16,502
Are they going?

1229
01:02:20,003 --> 01:02:23,330
[Kwang Soo arrives on the first floor
in order to keep Gary captured.]

1230
01:02:23,331 --> 01:02:24,433
What is that?

1231
01:02:24,434 --> 01:02:25,805
- Huh?
- What is that?

1232
01:02:25,806 --> 01:02:28,403
[Surprised at seeing his
Jung Woo Sung fan club t-shirt.]

1233
01:02:28,404 --> 01:02:29,605
We have to gather up our strength.

1234
01:02:31,468 --> 01:02:35,083
I'm an impatient person to begin with,
but I've never felt this impatient before.

1235
01:02:45,910 --> 01:02:47,126
Let's go this way.

1236
01:02:50,155 --> 01:02:53,166
[The Grim Reaper has arrived!]

1237
01:02:54,334 --> 01:02:58,068
[Ambushes his third target, Gary!]

1238
01:03:01,226 --> 01:03:05,872
[Succeeds in hunting down his
third target, Gary.]

1239
01:03:05,873 --> 01:03:07,808
- What is this?
- Where's Hyo Joo?

1240
01:03:08,625 --> 01:03:09,981
Huh?
Where's Hyo Joo?

1241
01:03:09,982 --> 01:03:11,498
Wow, he's so good looking.

1242
01:03:13,902 --> 01:03:16,029
- Where's Hyo Joo?
- If you even casted a single vote against me!

1243
01:03:16,030 --> 01:03:18,650
- Kwang Soo, where's Hyo Joo?
- Hyo Joo's not next.

1244
01:03:19,125 --> 01:03:20,661
Hyo Joo's not next.

1245
01:03:21,114 --> 01:03:24,336
[His next target is Junho?]

1246
01:03:24,337 --> 01:03:27,335
[Grim Reaper chasing after his
sixth target, Hyo Joo?]

1247
01:03:27,968 --> 01:03:29,426
Hyo Joo's not next!

1248
01:03:29,936 --> 01:03:31,846
You have to go in order!
Hyo Joo's not next!

1249
01:03:31,847 --> 01:03:34,990
- Come here. Come here for a moment.
- Wait... he says I'm not next!

1250
01:03:34,991 --> 01:03:37,351
- I won't kill you. I'm not going to kill you.
- You can't oust her yet.

1251
01:03:37,352 --> 01:03:38,560
You can't eliminate her.

1252
01:03:38,561 --> 01:03:40,789
I'm going to propose something to you.

1253
01:03:40,790 --> 01:03:42,572
- I'll help you out.
- I'm so scared right now.

1254
01:03:45,488 --> 01:03:48,788
Okay, listen to me.
Junho... go get Junho for me.

1255
01:03:48,789 --> 01:03:50,949
- If you do, you'll become our teammate.
- Me?

1256
01:03:50,950 --> 01:03:53,429
You think she's going to fall for that?

1257
01:03:53,430 --> 01:03:54,860
That doesn't sound right.

1258
01:03:54,861 --> 01:03:57,792
I'm serious.
I'll seriously make you my spy.

1259
01:03:57,793 --> 01:04:00,248
- Wait a second...
- Then you'll become my spy.

1260
01:04:00,249 --> 01:04:02,356
[Lying through his teeth again
like he did to Jae Suk earlier.]

1261
01:04:02,357 --> 01:04:03,524
I'm serious.

1262
01:04:03,525 --> 01:04:04,896
You can trust me.

1263
01:04:04,897 --> 01:04:06,492
- I'll see you later.
- Wait...

1264
01:04:08,021 --> 01:04:12,368
[What is he talking about?]

1265
01:04:13,368 --> 01:04:15,451
Wow, I can't believe
Jung Woo Sung is here.

1266
01:04:16,296 --> 01:04:19,266
I saw him at Hyun Joon's wedding,
but he didn't mention coming on the show.

1267
01:04:19,267 --> 01:04:20,626
Oh my goodness!

1268
01:04:21,684 --> 01:04:25,801
[A quiet and gentle surprise.]

1269
01:04:26,082 --> 01:04:29,331
- Woo Sung...
- Do you really want me to oust you?

1270
01:04:29,332 --> 01:04:31,366
- I'm really going to rip it off.
- No, that's not it.

1271
01:04:31,367 --> 01:04:33,295
Do you really want me to tear it off?

1272
01:04:33,714 --> 01:04:37,297
- Woo Sung, please calm down.
- I really wanted to be calm about this.

1273
01:04:38,427 --> 01:04:40,178
- I wanted to be calm about it.
- Please don't get agitated.

1274
01:04:40,179 --> 01:04:41,971
You really caught me off guard right now.

1275
01:04:41,972 --> 01:04:46,295
- Woo Sung... that's not it.
- I asked you to get Gary for me.

1276
01:04:46,296 --> 01:04:48,349
- But I ousted Gary myself.
- You ousted him?

1277
01:04:49,405 --> 01:04:52,022
- I'll do better. I'm looking for others.
- You have to get the next one for me.

1278
01:04:52,023 --> 01:04:53,943
- Don't worry.
- Go get me the next person.

1279
01:04:53,944 --> 01:04:56,621
- We're on the same team. Don't worry.
- Go get me the next person.

1280
01:04:56,622 --> 01:05:00,072
And I'm going to give you a tip.
But Hyo Joo's also on our side.

1281
01:05:00,073 --> 01:05:02,219
- Really?
- Yes, Hyo Joo's on our side too.

1282
01:05:02,551 --> 01:05:05,483
I told Hyo Joo to find and bring
Junho to me.

1283
01:05:05,484 --> 01:05:06,909
- Hyo Joo as well?
- Yes.

1284
01:05:06,910 --> 01:05:11,285
So you have to bring Junho and
Kim Jong Kook over to me.

1285
01:05:11,286 --> 01:05:13,066
[Telling him to bring Junho and Jong Kook
over to him in that order.]

1286
01:05:13,067 --> 01:05:15,566
- So it's Junho then Jong Kook?
- You've got ten minutes.

1287
01:05:15,567 --> 01:05:16,591
Okay.

1288
01:05:16,592 --> 01:05:17,958
Fighting.

1289
01:05:19,379 --> 01:05:21,140
Wait...

1290
01:05:21,637 --> 01:05:23,617
This is a variety show,
but it feels too much like a movie.

1291
01:05:24,298 --> 01:05:25,629
Woo Sung.

1292
01:05:26,255 --> 01:05:27,644
I'm sorry.

1293
01:05:28,473 --> 01:05:31,637
[There's no need to be sorry...]

1294
01:05:31,638 --> 01:05:34,595
- We're on the same team now.
- Yes, I'm your spy.

1295
01:05:34,596 --> 01:05:37,453
Come on, we're on the same team.
So why are you doing that?

1296
01:05:37,785 --> 01:05:39,717
I'll see you later.
I'll bring them to you.

1297
01:05:39,718 --> 01:05:40,887
- And also...
- Yes?

1298
01:05:40,888 --> 01:05:43,156
Please stop turning off the
CCTV cameras now.

1299
01:05:43,157 --> 01:05:45,196
- But you told me to turn them off earlier.
- I...

1300
01:05:45,197 --> 01:05:49,895
I told you to turn them off earlier
because I didn't want them to be suspicious.

1301
01:05:51,070 --> 01:05:52,112
Okay.

1302
01:05:53,345 --> 01:05:55,632
I actually only turned off
about two cameras.

1303
01:05:56,150 --> 01:05:58,898
- I'm watching everything.
- You're watching everything?

1304
01:05:58,899 --> 01:06:02,088
- Me? How?
- My eyes are the CCTV cameras.

1305
01:06:02,721 --> 01:06:04,709
My eyes are CCTV cameras.

1306
01:06:05,152 --> 01:06:07,595
- What did you say?
- My eyes are the CCTV cameras.

1307
01:06:08,462 --> 01:06:10,282
Woo Sung, we're on the same team.

1308
01:06:10,283 --> 01:06:11,950
Of course, I'm with you.

1309
01:06:11,951 --> 01:06:13,662
- Hyo Joo too.
- Don't worry.

1310
01:06:20,481 --> 01:06:23,380
[Ten years off his life.]

1311
01:06:24,705 --> 01:06:28,203
See? He may scare me,
but he's not ousting me right now.

1312
01:06:28,204 --> 01:06:31,691
I don't know what the order is right now,
but it's not my turn right now.

1313
01:06:32,381 --> 01:06:34,017
I think I'm further down the list.

1314
01:06:34,949 --> 01:06:36,010
When is my turn?

1315
01:06:36,011 --> 01:06:39,378
When did he sneak up on me like that?
He startled me.

1316
01:06:42,539 --> 01:06:45,948
- Wow, today really is...
- I hear bells.

1317
01:06:45,949 --> 01:06:48,336
- I think it's going to be over soon.
- I'm sorry everyone.

1318
01:06:49,242 --> 01:06:51,472
[Visiting jail to greet everyone.]

1319
01:06:51,473 --> 01:06:53,500
Sorry for the late greetings.
Hello.

1320
01:06:53,501 --> 01:06:57,811
[Formally greeting one another since
they didn't have the chance to do it earlier.]

1321
01:06:57,812 --> 01:06:59,905
I know I should've greeted you first,
but I didn't get the chance.

1322
01:06:59,906 --> 01:07:02,328
I know.
But my mission had already started.

1323
01:07:02,329 --> 01:07:07,053
- And this building is so huge.
- So what's the order for the day?

1324
01:07:07,088 --> 01:07:10,523
The two people that were eliminated
gave me their death notes.

1325
01:07:10,524 --> 01:07:12,055
- So I was number one?
- Yes.

1326
01:07:12,407 --> 01:07:14,497
- They had a lot of grudge against you.
- Against me?

1327
01:07:14,849 --> 01:07:17,040
- Unbelievable. Against me?
- They were talking about you.

1328
01:07:17,041 --> 01:07:18,850
- They were talking about you.
- About me?

1329
01:07:18,851 --> 01:07:20,178
- Yes.
- This is driving me crazy.

1330
01:07:20,179 --> 01:07:22,525
And they also have a lot of
grudge against you.

1331
01:07:22,526 --> 01:07:24,539
They said you're always disrespecting them.

1332
01:07:24,540 --> 01:07:26,663
- Me?
- Yes, they said you disrespected them.

1333
01:07:26,664 --> 01:07:30,338
- Then why me?
- They said you pay them no attention.

1334
01:07:30,339 --> 01:07:31,690
- Me?
- Yes.

1335
01:07:32,499 --> 01:07:37,580
They said you don't care what happens to them
and at least these two gives them attention.

1336
01:07:37,581 --> 01:07:38,997
They said that you have no
interest in them.

1337
01:07:38,998 --> 01:07:41,882
So they asked me to put you somewhere in
the middle of the list to oust you.

1338
01:07:43,576 --> 01:07:46,590
- That's what they said.
- I can't believe this.

1339
01:07:47,417 --> 01:07:50,520
I heard pretty much everything
that they had to say about you guys.

1340
01:07:50,521 --> 01:07:54,835
<i>63 CCTV cameras are currently disabled.
Only 45 CCTV cameras left.</i>

1341
01:07:54,836 --> 01:07:57,019
- So who's next on the list?
- You don't need to know that.

1342
01:07:57,020 --> 01:07:58,737
- Just rest easy over here.
- Woo Sung.

1343
01:07:58,738 --> 01:08:02,236
You have to keep this in mind. Ha Ha
and Kwang Soo will betray you for sure.

1344
01:08:02,237 --> 01:08:04,185
- Yes, okay.
- Be careful.

1345
01:08:04,186 --> 01:08:06,117
- You have to be careful of those two.
- Yes, I'll be careful.

1346
01:08:06,118 --> 01:08:09,210
- You have to be careful.
- Even his exit is cool.

1347
01:08:09,211 --> 01:08:11,582
- He's just so cool.
- The days of your motorcycle days...

1348
01:08:11,583 --> 01:08:13,287
So cool... I love you.

1349
01:08:13,779 --> 01:08:17,245
- Did you see how cool his exit was?
- When did I ever disrespect them?

1350
01:08:17,687 --> 01:08:19,370
Ha Dong Hoon!

1351
01:08:19,371 --> 01:08:20,946
- I can't believe it.
- At least you have a reason.

1352
01:08:20,947 --> 01:08:23,684
I just got ousted for no reason.

1353
01:08:25,966 --> 01:08:28,492
[On the other hand]

1354
01:08:31,834 --> 01:08:33,000
Nice.

1355
01:08:33,853 --> 01:08:35,377
There are so many.

1356
01:08:35,378 --> 01:08:36,776
[Junho searching through the radio
broadcasting room.]

1357
01:08:36,777 --> 01:08:38,429
Here's another one.

1358
01:08:40,778 --> 01:08:45,999
<i>69 CCTV cameras currently disabled.
39 cameras left.</i>

1359
01:08:49,801 --> 01:08:51,935
Jong Kook...
he's on the first lower level.

1360
01:08:56,153 --> 01:08:59,702
[Junho is searching through the garden
on the rooftop of the ninth floor.]

1361
01:08:59,703 --> 01:09:00,996
Okay.

1362
01:09:00,997 --> 01:09:02,130
Nice.

1363
01:09:03,332 --> 01:09:05,938
There he is again.
This is so frustrating!

1364
01:09:05,939 --> 01:09:07,762
I can't see anything!

1365
01:09:07,763 --> 01:09:10,961
[Amazing Running Man members.
Tirelessly finding and disabling the CCTV.]

1366
01:09:12,232 --> 01:09:14,015
Wait, isn't that Junho?

1367
01:09:15,991 --> 01:09:20,532
[Discovers the fourth target Junho
on the rooftop garden on the ninth floor.]

1368
01:09:20,533 --> 01:09:22,017
He's up in the garden.

1369
01:09:22,018 --> 01:09:24,046
- Ninth floor?
- Yes, on the ninth floor.

1370
01:09:24,047 --> 01:09:27,160
- Hey, but are you even doing your job right?
- Yes, I'm working really hard right now.

1371
01:09:27,161 --> 01:09:29,066
- I'm working really hard right now.
- Look at me right now.

1372
01:09:29,067 --> 01:09:31,461
I'm a totally different person now
than I was when I first left this room.

1373
01:09:31,462 --> 01:09:34,496
- You have to go oust him right now.
- Okay, I'll go oust him right now.

1374
01:09:34,497 --> 01:09:35,814
Just give me a minute.

1375
01:09:35,815 --> 01:09:37,994
I really want to oust him too right now.

1376
01:09:39,494 --> 01:09:41,145
I really want to oust him.

1377
01:09:41,146 --> 01:09:42,530
Do you have your name tag?
You're just going to wear that?

1378
01:09:42,531 --> 01:09:44,598
- Yeah, I'm just going to wear that.
- Woo Sung, ninth floor.

1379
01:09:44,599 --> 01:09:46,585
- Help me get this off.
- Woo Sung, ninth floor.

1380
01:09:46,586 --> 01:09:48,574
- I got it, but help me get this off.
- Okay.

1381
01:09:48,575 --> 01:09:51,056
The person who eliminates him
gets this as a prize.

1382
01:09:51,057 --> 01:09:54,283
[A winning prize?
Woo Sung's sweat soaked shirt?]

1383
01:09:54,284 --> 01:09:55,603
You can have it.

1384
01:09:57,386 --> 01:09:58,801
- Ninth floor?
- Yes, ninth floor.

1385
01:09:59,446 --> 01:10:02,367
He turned everything off on the ninth floor.
But you should still go to the ninth floor.

1386
01:10:03,050 --> 01:10:04,830
- You have to run!
- Okay.

1387
01:10:07,288 --> 01:10:11,282
Ha Ha probably has no idea how much
I'm running around right now, does he?

1388
01:10:14,462 --> 01:10:16,710
This is scary. I don't know
why my heart's beating so fast.

1389
01:10:26,702 --> 01:10:29,017
Okay, I should head the other way.

1390
01:10:29,018 --> 01:10:30,409
I need to finish this up.

1391
01:10:41,432 --> 01:10:42,954
The weather is so nice.

1392
01:10:42,955 --> 01:10:44,229
It's so nice and cool.

1393
01:10:47,622 --> 01:10:48,934
Junho!

1394
01:10:51,248 --> 01:10:52,496
Junho.

1395
01:10:52,812 --> 01:10:54,463
- Junho.
- Yes, Woo Sung?

1396
01:10:54,816 --> 01:10:57,543
- Come here Junho, I have to talk to you.
- What are you doing here?

1397
01:10:57,944 --> 01:11:02,295
[Escaping back up onto the rooftop.]

1398
01:11:02,296 --> 01:11:04,265
[The chase is on!]

1399
01:11:05,546 --> 01:11:07,030
[A dead end!]

1400
01:11:07,031 --> 01:11:08,136
Junho.

1401
01:11:10,354 --> 01:11:11,912
- I have to talk to you.
- Excuse me?

1402
01:11:13,565 --> 01:11:15,646
[Grim Reaper also climbs up
onto the ledge.]

1403
01:11:16,158 --> 01:11:17,296
Come here.

1404
01:11:17,297 --> 01:11:20,584
[Nowhere to turn.]

1405
01:11:20,585 --> 01:11:22,614
- Please, Woo Sung, wait...
- Come here, Junho.

1406
01:11:22,615 --> 01:11:24,184
What's going on here?

1407
01:11:27,098 --> 01:11:31,158
[Succeeds at hunting down his
fourth target, Junho!]

1408
01:11:31,159 --> 01:11:33,214
That was totally scary.

1409
01:11:33,742 --> 01:11:37,151
<i>Junho, out.
Junho, out.</i>

1410
01:11:37,762 --> 01:11:41,178
People still left are
Kim Jong Kook, Han Hyo Joo and Yoo Jae Suk.

1411
01:11:41,179 --> 01:11:44,010
No choice for Jong Kook either.
Kwang Soo has to go after him.

1412
01:11:44,011 --> 01:11:45,817
Lee Kwang Soo, what are you up to?

1413
01:11:46,164 --> 01:11:47,714
- Jong Kook.
- What are you up to?

1414
01:11:47,715 --> 01:11:49,822
[Tiger bothered my seeing
the Giraffe constantly walking around.]

1415
01:11:49,823 --> 01:11:51,128
- Who are you helping?
- I'm on your side!

1416
01:11:51,129 --> 01:11:52,719
- What?
- Kwang Soo.

1417
01:11:52,720 --> 01:11:57,100
Kwang Soo and Ha Ha are killing
the people that they have grudges against.

1418
01:11:57,101 --> 01:11:59,972
Did you hear that? I heard the bells.
Who is that?

1419
01:12:00,968 --> 01:12:02,178
Who is that?

1420
01:12:02,179 --> 01:12:05,929
[Mr. Capable still unaware of
who the Grim Reaper is.]

1421
01:12:05,930 --> 01:12:07,235
Up there... I see someone up there.

1422
01:12:07,236 --> 01:12:10,268
- I can hear the bells coming down.
- Jong Kook still doesn't know who it is?

1423
01:12:10,644 --> 01:12:12,300
- Jong Kook!
- Yeah?

1424
01:12:12,832 --> 01:12:15,202
Woo Sung is the Grim Reaper!

1425
01:12:15,203 --> 01:12:16,420
- Really?
- Yes.

1426
01:12:16,421 --> 01:12:17,910
- Seriously?
- Hi!

1427
01:12:19,499 --> 01:12:20,666
Hi!

1428
01:12:20,667 --> 01:12:23,647
[Grim Reaper Woo Sung beelines
for his fifth target, Jong Kook.]

1429
01:12:24,241 --> 01:12:27,329
[Mr. Capable fleeing with every ounce
of energy he has in his body.]

1430
01:12:27,330 --> 01:12:29,084
Woo Sung!
Why are you doing this to me?

1431
01:12:29,923 --> 01:12:31,050
Woo Sung!

1432
01:12:31,051 --> 01:12:32,542
Woo Sung, why are you doing this?

1433
01:12:36,136 --> 01:12:38,616
[Mr. Capable is quicker on the stairs!]

1434
01:12:38,617 --> 01:12:40,018
- Come here for a second.
- Why are you doing this?

1435
01:12:41,842 --> 01:12:43,682
- I'm a huge fan of yours!
- Wait.

1436
01:12:43,683 --> 01:12:44,941
- Hang on a second.
- I'm a huge fan of yours!

1437
01:12:45,409 --> 01:12:46,772
Ugh, this is so frustrating.

1438
01:12:49,048 --> 01:12:55,154
You know how in movies people are watching
from the surveillance room

1439
01:12:55,155 --> 01:12:56,721
and all the screens go out?

1440
01:12:56,722 --> 01:12:59,613
And while the main character doesn't know
what to do, he gets a sudden phone call?

1441
01:13:00,120 --> 01:13:03,578
'He's still alive!'
And everyone cheers?

1442
01:13:03,579 --> 01:13:05,098
I really want to try something like that.

1443
01:13:05,509 --> 01:13:07,615
What if all these screens go off?
Oh, I got a phone call.

1444
01:13:07,616 --> 01:13:11,910
Call Kwang Soo and ask him
where he is.

1445
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:15,436
Kwang Soo is chasing after
Jong Kook right now.

1446
01:13:15,437 --> 01:13:17,422
If you find Kwang Soo,
you can find Jong Kook.

1447
01:13:18,447 --> 01:13:20,028
Jung Woo Sung!

1448
01:13:20,855 --> 01:13:23,906
Jong Kook!
Woo Sung!

1449
01:13:24,908 --> 01:13:26,379
Hurry!

1450
01:13:29,342 --> 01:13:30,488
Hello?

1451
01:13:30,489 --> 01:13:33,446
Woo Sung,
I'm chasing after Jong Kook right now.

1452
01:13:33,447 --> 01:13:34,706
Talk to me, Kwang Soo.

1453
01:13:34,707 --> 01:13:36,843
- Sixth floor. Sixth floor!
- Okay.

1454
01:13:44,624 --> 01:13:46,996
[Discovers Jong Kook off in the distance!]

1455
01:13:48,753 --> 01:13:53,024
[A Tiger that can't attack is no problem!]

1456
01:13:53,025 --> 01:13:55,928
[A huge help from the Giraffe's
relentless pursuit!]

1457
01:13:56,350 --> 01:13:59,405
[Succeeds in hunting down
his fifth target!]

1458
01:13:59,406 --> 01:14:01,305
You were my biggest hurdle.

1459
01:14:01,306 --> 01:14:02,332
[Kim Jong Kook- Out!]

1460
01:14:08,974 --> 01:14:12,588
<i>Kim Jong Kook, out!
Kim Jong Kook, out!</i>

1461
01:14:13,746 --> 01:14:16,684
[Remaining Running Man members-
Hyo Joo and Jae Suk.]

1462
01:14:16,685 --> 01:14:18,909
Ha Ha and Lee Kwang Soo those scoundrels
are hell-bent on killing me.

1463
01:14:21,418 --> 01:14:23,644
This really is...

1464
01:14:23,645 --> 01:14:25,375
If I don't end this quickly, I'm dead.

1465
01:14:26,540 --> 01:14:28,662
I have to turn off all the CCTV cameras.

1466
01:14:28,663 --> 01:14:30,697
I think that's what my mission
is right now.

1467
01:14:31,222 --> 01:14:34,013
It's not like I can fight them off
with my own strength.

1468
01:14:34,014 --> 01:14:36,958
They're all so strong!

1469
01:14:43,935 --> 01:14:45,224
This is one of them, right?

1470
01:14:47,012 --> 01:14:48,779
It's so odd looking.

1471
01:14:56,694 --> 01:15:01,288
[Only cameras that are left now are the ones
hidden away in difficult spots.]

1472
01:15:03,470 --> 01:15:05,414
<i>Ah... Jae Suk.</i>

1473
01:15:06,767 --> 01:15:09,473
<i>Don't you think I can get out
there too now?</i>

1474
01:15:09,820 --> 01:15:11,851
<i>Surveillance room is not much
help anymore.</i>

1475
01:15:17,637 --> 01:15:19,070
It's coming from in there.

1476
01:15:19,629 --> 01:15:21,411
Hello.
Hello.

1477
01:15:22,143 --> 01:15:23,447
Here's another one.

1478
01:15:24,628 --> 01:15:28,288
[Now heading off to where
Ha Ha's voice is coming from.]

1479
01:15:28,289 --> 01:15:29,984
Jae Suk is on the 13th floor.

1480
01:15:30,616 --> 01:15:31,956
Right here!

1481
01:15:34,339 --> 01:15:35,862
There you are.

1482
01:15:35,863 --> 01:15:38,479
- You startled me.
- What are you doing?

1483
01:15:38,480 --> 01:15:40,744
You're not supposed to be in here.

1484
01:15:40,745 --> 01:15:44,696
Hey, hang on a second.
You little scoundrels!

1485
01:15:45,037 --> 01:15:47,537
- You two wrote this, didn't you?
- That's right!

1486
01:15:47,538 --> 01:15:49,712
Yes, we wrote it.
What are you going to do about it?

1487
01:15:49,713 --> 01:15:51,941
- You deserve it!
- What is this?

1488
01:15:51,942 --> 01:15:54,584
- What are you guys doing?
- We're members of Jung Woo Sung's fan club!

1489
01:15:55,401 --> 01:15:59,456
Wait, you guys dare to write
my name in here?

1490
01:16:01,073 --> 01:16:02,191
Give it back!

1491
01:16:02,192 --> 01:16:03,593
Where did Kwang Soo go?

1492
01:16:04,139 --> 01:16:05,408
I don't know!

1493
01:16:05,409 --> 01:16:07,111
Where did he go?

1494
01:16:07,112 --> 01:16:08,720
First floor lower level.

1495
01:16:09,477 --> 01:16:11,779
Wait, where...
where is that right now?

1496
01:16:12,907 --> 01:16:15,300
- And where is that supposed to be?
- You can't be looking at that!

1497
01:16:15,301 --> 01:16:17,278
Hurry up and get out of here!
Get out!

1498
01:16:17,279 --> 01:16:19,472
Just get out of here.
Get out!

1499
01:16:20,481 --> 01:16:24,700
[Chasing him out of the surveillance room.]

1500
01:16:24,701 --> 01:16:26,338
- You can't do that.
- Hey.

1501
01:16:26,373 --> 01:16:28,702
- Are you...
- You're last!

1502
01:16:29,889 --> 01:16:31,724
It would serve you to turn off
all the cameras quickly!

1503
01:16:32,351 --> 01:16:35,113
We wanted you to quake in fear.

1504
01:16:35,114 --> 01:16:37,185
You just wait and see.
You just wait.

1505
01:16:37,186 --> 01:16:39,083
- He's coming for you.
- You just wait.

1506
01:16:39,695 --> 01:16:41,120
Where was that spot?

1507
01:16:41,121 --> 01:16:42,788
It looked like it was underneath
a desk somewhere.

1508
01:16:43,323 --> 01:16:45,765
The other looked like a helipad.
Up on the rooftop somewhere.

1509
01:16:45,766 --> 01:16:47,618
I just saw it.

1510
01:16:52,246 --> 01:16:54,068
I saw one around something like this.

1511
01:16:56,217 --> 01:16:58,213
[Bingo]

1512
01:17:00,605 --> 01:17:02,552
Hey!
Are you watching this?

1513
01:17:02,553 --> 01:17:05,539
You're finished.
You'll soon be finished.

1514
01:17:05,603 --> 01:17:08,392
Jae Suk is up on the rooftop right now.

1515
01:17:08,393 --> 01:17:11,857
You're finished.
You'll soon be finished.

1516
01:17:11,858 --> 01:17:13,801
He just turned off the camera
up on the rooftop.

1517
01:17:14,303 --> 01:17:18,613
[Should've locked the door...]

1518
01:17:18,614 --> 01:17:19,855
He saw the screens in here.

1519
01:17:25,667 --> 01:17:27,835
[Hyo Joo turns off another one.]

1520
01:17:27,836 --> 01:17:31,876
<i>100 cameras currently disabled.
8 left remaining.</i>

1521
01:17:32,334 --> 01:17:36,384
<i>100 cameras currently disabled.
8 left remaining.</i>

1522
01:17:36,385 --> 01:17:37,508
[Only eight are left!]

1523
01:17:37,509 --> 01:17:39,244
She found another one.

1524
01:17:41,798 --> 01:17:46,321
One, two, three, four, five, six,
seven left.

1525
01:17:49,224 --> 01:17:54,828
[Will he finish the hunt first,
or will the CCTV's be disabled first?]

1526
01:17:55,444 --> 01:17:56,900
There.
There it is.

1527
01:17:59,250 --> 01:18:00,532
Ha Ha, are you watching?

1528
01:18:00,533 --> 01:18:03,027
You and Kwang Soo are finished.

1529
01:18:03,886 --> 01:18:05,711
What did you say?
What did you just say?

1530
01:18:08,869 --> 01:18:12,171
[Only six left remaining.]

1531
01:18:13,764 --> 01:18:14,798
There it is!

1532
01:18:24,624 --> 01:18:25,875
Ha Ha.

1533
01:18:25,876 --> 01:18:27,530
- Yes, Woo Sung?
- Where's Hyo Joo?

1534
01:18:27,996 --> 01:18:30,350
Hyo Joo?
I can't see Hyo Joo.

1535
01:18:30,351 --> 01:18:32,229
We've only got five cameras left.

1536
01:18:32,230 --> 01:18:34,881
[Difficult to locate them with
only five cameras left remaining.]

1537
01:18:34,882 --> 01:18:36,780
- Should I call her out?
- Try the second floor.

1538
01:18:36,781 --> 01:18:37,857
Yes.

1539
01:18:38,442 --> 01:18:40,739
- We have to scatter about.
- Okay.

1540
01:18:40,740 --> 01:18:44,064
The ones that are left are on 12th floor,
21st floor...

1541
01:18:44,777 --> 01:18:48,495
second, and sixth floor.
And Jae Suk found this room.

1542
01:18:49,150 --> 01:18:53,910
[12th, 21st, second and sixth floor!]

1543
01:18:55,940 --> 01:18:58,334
Sixth, sixth... let's go to sixth.

1544
01:19:05,035 --> 01:19:07,303
[Hyo Joo's already on the 12th floor.]

1545
01:19:12,982 --> 01:19:14,903
[Discovered!]

1546
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:20,334
Wow, there it is.

1547
01:19:20,335 --> 01:19:23,078
[Jae Suk finally finds
the one on the sixth floor.]

1548
01:19:23,079 --> 01:19:24,155
Have a good day.

1549
01:19:25,265 --> 01:19:29,250
[Only two left!]

1550
01:19:29,251 --> 01:19:32,397
<i>106 CCTV currently disabled.
Only two CCTV's left remaining.</i>

1551
01:19:32,920 --> 01:19:37,394
<i>106 CCTV currently disabled.
Only two CCTV's left remaining.</i>

1552
01:19:41,647 --> 01:19:43,184
That's really tricky.

1553
01:19:46,731 --> 01:19:49,462
- Its Jae Suk!
- This is the screen I saw earlier.

1554
01:19:49,497 --> 01:19:51,312
I was wondering where this one was.

1555
01:19:53,913 --> 01:19:56,609
[CCTV on the second floor is turned off!]

1556
01:19:56,610 --> 01:19:59,513
Woo Sung.
Second floor. He's on the second floor.

1557
01:19:59,514 --> 01:20:01,035
Second floor!

1558
01:20:01,036 --> 01:20:03,289
- Second floor?
- Yes, you have to get down there quickly.

1559
01:20:04,299 --> 01:20:08,620
<i>107 CCTV currently disabled.
Only one CCTV's left remaining.</i>

1560
01:20:08,621 --> 01:20:13,374
<i>107 CCTV currently disabled.
Only one CCTV's left remaining.</i>

1561
01:20:13,375 --> 01:20:17,247
[Once all 108 cameras are shut off,
the Grim Reaper can also be hunted down!]

1562
01:20:17,248 --> 01:20:20,984
[Only one CCTV left!]

1563
01:20:34,217 --> 01:20:36,371
- Don't you think you're being too much?
- About what?

1564
01:20:37,042 --> 01:20:42,916
[No matter how angry Woo Sung is,
he still can't oust him out of order.]

1565
01:20:42,917 --> 01:20:46,404
- I'm guessing it's not my turn yet?
- I'll give you one last chance.

1566
01:20:46,405 --> 01:20:47,840
Chance at what?

1567
01:20:48,162 --> 01:20:50,717
- You'd better not let me catch you.
- Okay, I understand.

1568
01:20:50,718 --> 01:20:54,840
[Warning!
Do not get caught!]

1569
01:20:54,841 --> 01:20:57,608
Yes, I understand.
There's only one camera left.

1570
01:20:57,609 --> 01:20:59,732
- Then it's war.
- We'll see you later.

1571
01:21:00,044 --> 01:21:04,988
- We already are at war.
- But it'll start for real in a bit.

1572
01:21:04,989 --> 01:21:07,241
I understand.
But you'd better get Hyo Joo first.

1573
01:21:07,242 --> 01:21:08,454
Yes, I will.

1574
01:21:08,728 --> 01:21:10,628
- I'm going to get going now.
- Go ahead.

1575
01:21:10,629 --> 01:21:12,617
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to walk around.

1576
01:21:13,738 --> 01:21:16,225
I need to go catch Hyo Joo.

1577
01:21:20,675 --> 01:21:21,983
He scared me.

1578
01:21:21,984 --> 01:21:23,312
He really scared me.

1579
01:21:26,988 --> 01:21:30,687
I'm going to need Hyo Joo's help.
I don't think I can handle him on my own.

1580
01:21:30,688 --> 01:21:33,401
Jung Woo Sung is really strong.

1581
01:21:34,355 --> 01:21:37,733
- Jae Suk got everything.
- This is 21st floor!

1582
01:21:37,734 --> 01:21:39,699
The one that's left is up on the 21st floor.

1583
01:21:39,700 --> 01:21:42,750
[The last CCTV still left.]

1584
01:21:43,137 --> 01:21:44,777
It's all over once this one is shut off.

1585
01:21:44,778 --> 01:21:46,793
You can't even do anything then.

1586
01:21:46,794 --> 01:21:49,250
- Neither one of us can do anything.
- Okay, I'm going to call Woo Sung.

1587
01:21:50,599 --> 01:21:53,242
Since I saw Jung Woo Sung
down below earlier...

1588
01:21:54,489 --> 01:21:56,901
But I didn't see anything earlier
when I searched through this floor.

1589
01:21:58,323 --> 01:22:02,998
[Down to the 21st floor
where the last camera is located!]

1590
01:22:04,721 --> 01:22:06,831
Someone already got to this one.
They're all shut off already.

1591
01:22:07,415 --> 01:22:10,319
Finding the last one
is going to be really hard.

1592
01:22:12,971 --> 01:22:14,512
They're up here?

1593
01:22:14,513 --> 01:22:16,526
- I wonder if something's up here.
- Wait.

1594
01:22:18,566 --> 01:22:20,103
Something must be up here.

1595
01:22:22,573 --> 01:22:24,311
Something must be up here, isn't it?

1596
01:22:24,312 --> 01:22:26,200
Isn't that why you're up here?

1597
01:22:27,978 --> 01:22:29,893
[This is it!]

1598
01:22:31,063 --> 01:22:32,558
[Answer your phone, Woo Sung!]

1599
01:22:32,559 --> 01:22:34,325
Something must be in here.

1600
01:22:34,326 --> 01:22:36,483
Why isn't the call going through?

1601
01:22:36,484 --> 01:22:38,940
Why isn't he answering his phone?
Why?

1602
01:22:38,941 --> 01:22:40,823
He must be out of his mind!

1603
01:22:45,402 --> 01:22:49,536
[Find the last remaining CCTV camera!]

1604
01:22:51,476 --> 01:22:54,918
Why isn't Woo Sung answering
his phone?

1605
01:22:57,379 --> 01:22:59,034
- Here it is!
- No!

1606
01:22:59,035 --> 01:23:01,459
[Jae Suk discovers the last remaining CCTV!]

1607
01:23:01,460 --> 01:23:02,839
I found the last one!

1608
01:23:03,759 --> 01:23:06,551
[The last remaining CCTV is turned off!]

1609
01:23:06,552 --> 01:23:07,675
You're finished.

1610
01:23:07,676 --> 01:23:09,955
- Here it is! I found it!
- No!

1611
01:23:10,636 --> 01:23:12,385
What the heck?
He found the last one?

1612
01:23:12,997 --> 01:23:17,496
[108 CCTV cameras...
All are now shut off!]

1613
01:23:17,497 --> 01:23:19,382
Hello?
Where are you right now?

1614
01:23:19,383 --> 01:23:21,857
I just got down to the 13th floor,
but why weren't you answering your phone?

1615
01:23:21,858 --> 01:23:24,071
All the cameras have been shut off.

1616
01:23:24,072 --> 01:23:26,794
- All the cameras have been shut off?
- All of them. They're all shut off.

1617
01:23:26,795 --> 01:23:29,445
If they're all shut off,
you should tell me and come out here.

1618
01:23:29,446 --> 01:23:32,096
It was the last one
that was up on the 21st floor.

1619
01:23:32,735 --> 01:23:34,716
Okay, I got it.
You can just stay there.

1620
01:23:34,717 --> 01:23:36,263
What does that mean?

1621
01:23:36,264 --> 01:23:40,659
<i>All the CCTV cameras are now off.
The Grim Reaper may now be hunted down.</i>

1622
01:23:40,660 --> 01:23:44,289
[Running Man members are now allowed
to hunt down the Grim Reaper!]

1623
01:23:44,290 --> 01:23:47,281
<i>You may now hunt down
the Grim Reaper.</i>

1624
01:23:51,723 --> 01:23:52,887
Oh my goodness!

1625
01:23:52,888 --> 01:23:54,249
You scared me!

1626
01:23:54,250 --> 01:23:56,812
Hyo Joo, please...
I got the last one.

1627
01:23:56,813 --> 01:23:58,622
I turned off the last one.
All of them have been shut off.

1628
01:23:58,623 --> 01:24:00,367
We can eliminate Ha Ha now.

1629
01:24:00,368 --> 01:24:01,849
What?
You can oust me?

1630
01:24:01,850 --> 01:24:05,834
[Eliminated twosome are already ousted,
but she's just taking her anger out on them.]

1631
01:24:05,835 --> 01:24:08,079
- How dare you do this to us?
- I just got out here.

1632
01:24:08,080 --> 01:24:09,280
- Ha Ha!
- What?

1633
01:24:09,281 --> 01:24:11,330
I just got out here.

1634
01:24:13,636 --> 01:24:16,351
Do you know what Jung Woo Sung
is putting us through right now?

1635
01:24:16,352 --> 01:24:18,439
- Do you?
- Do you know how this all happened?

1636
01:24:18,440 --> 01:24:19,761
This is your punishment for
how you treat me.

1637
01:24:19,762 --> 01:24:21,710
<i>All the CCTV cameras are now off.</i>

1638
01:24:21,711 --> 01:24:25,466
[Jae Suk and Hyo Joo are now able to
attack Woo Sung now.]

1639
01:24:25,467 --> 01:24:27,086
But Woo Sung's so scary.

1640
01:24:27,087 --> 01:24:28,939
- We're in big trouble.
- He's so scary.

1641
01:24:30,827 --> 01:24:33,922
But Woo Sung has to eliminate Hyo Joo first
before he can eliminate me, right?

1642
01:24:33,923 --> 01:24:35,229
That's correct.

1643
01:24:36,171 --> 01:24:39,676
I walked down a flight of stairs and saw
Ha Ha walking around the 21st floor.

1644
01:24:39,677 --> 01:24:43,512
So I thought he was there to find the last
camera and that's when I found it.

1645
01:24:43,513 --> 01:24:49,026
[The Grim Reaper arrives.]

1646
01:24:55,407 --> 01:24:56,495
Hyo Joo.

1647
01:24:57,324 --> 01:24:58,992
They were just here.

1648
01:25:03,172 --> 01:25:05,403
[Grim Reaper's target is his
sixth target, Hyo Joo!]

1649
01:25:06,420 --> 01:25:09,284
Hyo Joo, get out that door right now.

1650
01:25:09,931 --> 01:25:12,519
- We have to stick together, Hyo Joo.
- Come on!

1651
01:25:12,520 --> 01:25:14,326
Out of the way, Ha Ha.
I'll go first.

1652
01:25:18,564 --> 01:25:20,421
How are we going to oust him?
How?

1653
01:25:23,979 --> 01:25:25,344
- Let's hide in here.
- Here, Hyo Joo.

1654
01:25:29,535 --> 01:25:32,515
[Hyo Joo seeking refuge in a small room.]

1655
01:25:39,600 --> 01:25:40,652
Woo Sung.

1656
01:25:41,580 --> 01:25:45,228
[Can't get Jae Suk now...]

1657
01:25:45,229 --> 01:25:46,457
You have to get Hyo Joo.

1658
01:25:46,458 --> 01:25:49,767
- Where's Hyo Joo?
- I know you can't get me right now.

1659
01:25:49,768 --> 01:25:52,342
[Jae Suk pushing Woo Sung away
from where Hyo Joo is hiding.]

1660
01:25:52,343 --> 01:25:54,807
I know you can't oust me right now.

1661
01:25:54,808 --> 01:25:57,804
I know it's useless for you to
oust me right now.

1662
01:25:57,805 --> 01:25:59,866
- But what I'm saying is...
- I got it.

1663
01:25:59,867 --> 01:26:04,206
[Maybe Jae Suk should just attack
the Grim Reaper now.]

1664
01:26:04,539 --> 01:26:07,351
Where are you going?
Where are you planning on going?

1665
01:26:07,352 --> 01:26:08,747
[Grim Reaper is in danger!]

1666
01:26:09,212 --> 01:26:10,593
- Okay.
- Wait a second.

1667
01:26:10,594 --> 01:26:13,006
Wait, you don't have to
use your strength on me now.

1668
01:26:13,007 --> 01:26:14,878
Where do you think you're going?

1669
01:26:14,879 --> 01:26:16,912
Where are you going?
Where?

1670
01:26:21,126 --> 01:26:22,426
Woo Sung!

1671
01:26:25,065 --> 01:26:26,473
- Is he gone?
- He's gone.

1672
01:26:26,474 --> 01:26:29,473
I thought I was dead.

1673
01:26:30,014 --> 01:26:32,835
Hyo Joo... if we work together,
we may be able to beat him.

1674
01:26:32,836 --> 01:26:35,606
I know.
We can't beat him by ourselves.

1675
01:26:38,222 --> 01:26:40,037
- There he is again.
- Hello.

1676
01:26:40,038 --> 01:26:41,572
I'm just an innocent bystander
just trying to get by.

1677
01:26:43,158 --> 01:26:44,748
What are you doing?
Wait.

1678
01:26:44,749 --> 01:26:47,479
[Ridding him of his headset and
the phone so that he can't call Woo Sung.]

1679
01:26:47,480 --> 01:26:48,943
You can't talk to him anymore.

1680
01:26:49,288 --> 01:26:50,959
- You were going to call him, right?
- I'm confiscating it.

1681
01:26:50,960 --> 01:26:52,360
I won't call him.

1682
01:26:52,361 --> 01:26:54,377
- Just get in there.
- Wait.

1683
01:26:54,378 --> 01:26:56,791
- What are you doing? Hang on.
- Come on, Ha Ha.

1684
01:26:56,792 --> 01:26:59,051
I just got out here.

1685
01:26:59,052 --> 01:27:00,810
- What are you doing? I'll just go.
- Just go in there.

1686
01:27:01,444 --> 01:27:05,508
Come on, guys!
Are you kidding me right now?

1687
01:27:05,509 --> 01:27:07,479
- Let go!
- Get in there!

1688
01:27:07,480 --> 01:27:09,618
You have to at least let my cameraman in.

1689
01:27:09,619 --> 01:27:11,012
Okay, come in.

1690
01:27:11,013 --> 01:27:14,045
[It's their nature to still worry about
their cameras in these situation.]

1691
01:27:15,373 --> 01:27:17,326
Just give me my phone.
Give me my phone back!

1692
01:27:19,556 --> 01:27:21,202
Seriously!

1693
01:27:21,723 --> 01:27:25,037
I'll grab him for you.
I can't rip it off myself.

1694
01:27:25,431 --> 01:27:30,665
Stay in hiding and when you see me with
a hold on Woo Sung, come out and rip it off.

1695
01:27:30,666 --> 01:27:32,034
Got it?

1696
01:27:32,400 --> 01:27:33,467
Okay.

1697
01:27:33,468 --> 01:27:35,708
I wonder where I should hide?

1698
01:27:36,137 --> 01:27:37,805
Let's go down to the 13th floor.

1699
01:27:42,555 --> 01:27:45,070
I didn't know it would be down to
a fight between life and death like this.

1700
01:27:46,963 --> 01:27:49,876
Every time you come on the show...
it happens every time you're on the show.

1701
01:27:49,877 --> 01:27:52,075
- I know, right?
- Every single time.

1702
01:27:52,434 --> 01:27:54,791
I don't know why I play
with such crazy determination.

1703
01:27:56,911 --> 01:28:00,363
- You really are something.
- What have I even got to earn by doing this?

1704
01:28:00,364 --> 01:28:02,292
It's just in your nature to do it.

1705
01:28:07,649 --> 01:28:10,704
[Having somehow escaped...]

1706
01:28:14,587 --> 01:28:16,596
Woo Sung.
Jae Suk is heading this way.

1707
01:28:18,598 --> 01:28:21,289
Woo Sung!
Jae Suk is coming! Come in here!

1708
01:28:21,290 --> 01:28:23,029
[Luring him in to another location.]

1709
01:28:24,805 --> 01:28:26,804
Stand here and block them off.

1710
01:28:29,013 --> 01:28:31,357
- Stay in hiding.
- Woo Sung.

1711
01:28:32,027 --> 01:28:37,191
- Like I told you earlier...
- I must've forgotten again.

1712
01:28:37,192 --> 01:28:39,477
I can't oust him before
Hyo Joo, right?

1713
01:28:39,478 --> 01:28:41,381
I must've forgotten already.

1714
01:28:41,382 --> 01:28:45,711
[Hiding to ambush him?]

1715
01:28:45,712 --> 01:28:47,487
I thought that maybe I could
oust you now.

1716
01:28:47,488 --> 01:28:49,136
[Right in front of her sight...]

1717
01:28:49,137 --> 01:28:54,913
[is Woo Sung's name tag!]

1718
01:28:58,117 --> 01:29:02,254
[But loses her chance with him
moving too far out of her reach.]

1719
01:29:03,196 --> 01:29:04,810
- Woo Sung.
- Why don't you go rest for now?

1720
01:29:04,811 --> 01:29:07,011
- Its almost over now.
- Yes, so go get some rest.

1721
01:29:08,371 --> 01:29:10,255
[Jae Suk, I'm over here!]

1722
01:29:10,900 --> 01:29:12,342
- Where are you going?
- Me?

1723
01:29:12,343 --> 01:29:14,709
- Yes.
- I have to go somewhere.

1724
01:29:14,710 --> 01:29:17,845
I have to tell you as another human being,
that you're really cool.

1725
01:29:17,846 --> 01:29:19,177
Yes, thank you.

1726
01:29:19,614 --> 01:29:22,177
- You're really handsome.
- What?

1727
01:29:22,178 --> 01:29:24,028
You're not only just handsome,
but you're really cool too.

1728
01:29:24,029 --> 01:29:26,533
But why are you so sweaty?

1729
01:29:26,534 --> 01:29:29,632
It's just because my t-shirt is really thick.

1730
01:29:29,633 --> 01:29:32,276
Where are you going?
Where are you going?

1731
01:29:32,277 --> 01:29:34,564
Come on, let's just talk for a bit.

1732
01:29:34,872 --> 01:29:36,461
Okay, you can talk to me from over there.

1733
01:29:36,462 --> 01:29:40,425
[Staying alert since he doesn't know
where Hyo Joo will attack from.]

1734
01:29:41,693 --> 01:29:43,170
Come on!

1735
01:29:44,597 --> 01:29:46,215
Why is he running?

1736
01:29:47,313 --> 01:29:49,501
Did you see him bump into this?

1737
01:29:49,502 --> 01:29:53,223
- He bumped himself?
- Do you know what he just did here?

1738
01:29:53,224 --> 01:29:55,059
It was like a scene from an action film?

1739
01:29:55,060 --> 01:29:56,701
He opened like this.

1740
01:29:57,417 --> 01:29:59,783
There's no reason for him to do that.

1741
01:30:03,239 --> 01:30:04,353
Why did...

1742
01:30:04,388 --> 01:30:07,575
[Every move he makes is like a scene
out of an action film.]

1743
01:30:07,576 --> 01:30:08,743
He could've just opened it like this.

1744
01:30:08,744 --> 01:30:10,340
Seriously!

1745
01:30:11,761 --> 01:30:16,767
[Grim Reaper Woo Sung is staying
more cautious.]

1746
01:30:28,787 --> 01:30:31,009
[Grim Reaper Woo Sung is discovered!]

1747
01:30:53,611 --> 01:30:54,888
Where are you going?

1748
01:30:54,889 --> 01:30:56,366
- I'm looking for Han Hyo Joo.
- What?

1749
01:30:56,367 --> 01:30:58,380
- I have to find Han Hyo Joo.
- Why are you searching for Hyo Joo so much?

1750
01:30:58,381 --> 01:31:03,369
[Jae Suk distracting him with a conversation
to give Hyo Joo time to sneak up on Woo Sung.]

1751
01:31:03,370 --> 01:31:08,028
Why did you go through the door like you were
in an action film? What if you got hurt?

1752
01:31:08,029 --> 01:31:09,676
- Me?
- Yes.

1753
01:31:17,352 --> 01:31:20,552
[Hyo Joo springs her attack!]

1754
01:31:21,914 --> 01:31:25,526
[Grim Reaper is only attacking Hyo Joo!]

1755
01:31:25,527 --> 01:31:27,197
- Woo Sung... Woo Sung!
- Hang on.

1756
01:31:27,198 --> 01:31:30,711
[Fight off their attack while
attacking Hyo Joo simultaneously!]

1757
01:31:35,909 --> 01:31:39,074
[My goodness!
Fights off both at the same time!]

1758
01:31:39,075 --> 01:31:40,153
Hyo Joo!

1759
01:31:44,566 --> 01:31:46,515
[Hyo Joo in danger!]

1760
01:31:49,193 --> 01:31:50,503
- Wait!
- Sorry, Hyo Joo!

1761
01:31:50,504 --> 01:31:52,390
What are you doing!

1762
01:31:52,391 --> 01:31:55,088
[Just then!]

1763
01:31:55,089 --> 01:31:57,312
[Jae Sung attacks Woo Sung!]

1764
01:31:59,916 --> 01:32:01,327
I can't get it!

1765
01:32:03,947 --> 01:32:06,884
[Jae Suk and Hyo Joo at the same time!]

1766
01:32:10,423 --> 01:32:14,460
[Woo Sung lifts both of them up
off the ground!]

1767
01:32:20,554 --> 01:32:24,071
[While trying to lift them up...]

1768
01:32:24,072 --> 01:32:27,668
[The Grim Reaper gets ousted instead!]

1769
01:32:28,577 --> 01:32:30,023
We did it!

1770
01:32:31,319 --> 01:32:33,674
- We did it!
- What the heck is this?

1771
01:32:34,905 --> 01:32:36,225
I thought I was going to die!

1772
01:32:36,226 --> 01:32:37,909
I thought I was going to die.

1773
01:32:37,910 --> 01:32:39,791
Hyo Joo, are you okay?

1774
01:32:40,599 --> 01:32:43,009
Seriously... your strength!

1775
01:32:43,109 --> 01:32:45,649
Anyways, we won!

1776
01:32:45,650 --> 01:32:47,151
[Jae Suk and Hyo Joo are the
final survivors!]

1777
01:32:47,152 --> 01:32:49,003
Ugh, I lost!

1778
01:32:54,620 --> 01:32:59,132
For some reason, whenever we're in
SBS Mokdong office...

1779
01:32:59,133 --> 01:33:00,830
There's a special connection that
I have to this building.

1780
01:33:01,873 --> 01:33:04,115
It was a total movie.
Watch the episode when it airs.

1781
01:33:04,317 --> 01:33:06,643
He doesn't just open the door
like the rest of us.

1782
01:33:09,437 --> 01:33:11,841
[Action is his second nature.]

1783
01:33:11,842 --> 01:33:15,512
And I hate standing next to him more than
getting my name tag ripped off.

1784
01:33:15,513 --> 01:33:17,189
It's because he's way too good looking.

1785
01:33:17,190 --> 01:33:19,245
I'm sorry, but can you go
stand over there?

1786
01:33:19,246 --> 01:33:21,073
Please go stand over there next to them.

1787
01:33:21,074 --> 01:33:23,019
Stand right next to Jae Suk.

1788
01:33:23,020 --> 01:33:26,103
- He really looks so ugly.
- Look at how ugly Jae Suk looks!

1789
01:33:26,104 --> 01:33:27,337
[Total opposites]

1790
01:33:27,338 --> 01:33:30,275
[A world of difference]

1791
01:33:32,752 --> 01:33:37,160
As for the prize, all seven of the members
with the exception of the two in the back...

1792
01:33:37,161 --> 01:33:43,805
everyone including Junho and Hyo Joo
will each receive a prize for today's mission.

1793
