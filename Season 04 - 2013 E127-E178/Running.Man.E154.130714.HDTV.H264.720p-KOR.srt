[Only when completing the mission given
by their masters, can they shed the clothes.]

46
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:47,210
Since we're evenly numbered,
we've assigned each of you a master.

47
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:49,290
- Can you tell us who?
- Hang on a minute.

48
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:52,040
- Since you're a slave...
- Isn't Jong Kook Sulli's slave?

49
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,530
Just hang on a minute.

50

00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:04,150
And Gary will be in charge of Ji Hyo
and will be ordering her around today.

52
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:09,140
I actually happen to be wearing a denim
button-down shirt underneath this like Gary.

53
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,550
[Master Gary happy with the idea of
a couple look with his slave, Ji Hyo.]

- What is this between you guys?

55
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:17,530

- Okay, I'll pick the first one.

56
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:20,170
I really need to take this coat off.
I'm burning up underneath all this.

00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:28,800
Where are we going to find that
at the airport?

61
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,560
- I don't have any money either.
- I have no money either.

62
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:35,650
- You have to figure that out for yourself.
- Don't you want to take off that fur coat?

63
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:38,620
- I'm starting to sweat in this thing.
- Where are we going to find jippo?

64
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:40,980

67

Who knew that I'd ever be looking for
jippo at the Incheon airport?

68
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,560
- Do you sell jippo here?
- No, but we have dried squid.

69
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:58,530
Okay, thank you.

70

- Is there a convenience store in here?
- Over there in that direction.

[All the slaves heading off in the direction
of the Big-nosed Brother after seeing him.]

73
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:15,810
Suk Jin found it!

74
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:19,670
[Too busy paying for the jippo
to even think clearly.]

75
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,170
Please hurry!
Get away from me.

76
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:23,730
Let go!
Let go of me! It's over there.

77

[Everyone grabbing the jippo
by the handful.]

78
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,340

- What?

79
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:31,040
- You can get my change for me.
- Hey!

80
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:35,280
[Arriving back in a rush
to appease their masters.]

81

82
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:40,670

[Ji Hyo gets to take off her scarf
for having completed her mission.]

84
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:46,550
I like my caramel macchiato
in the mornings.

85
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:50,200
I need my caramel macchiato.
What are you doing, slave?

86
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:51,510
Hey, Song Ji Hyo!

87
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:54,110
Don't get too close to me!
You're going to make me weaken my resolve.

88
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:55,980
- You can take off your scarf.
- Thank you.

89
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:59,540
- Sure, you can take off the scarf.
- Kwang Soo, take off your panties.

90
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:00,580
What?

91
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:02,470
How can I take off my panties?

92
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:04,900
- I want a cola.
- Look at Jong Kook.

93
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,090
[Jong Kook having arrives at last,
and delivers the food to Sulli.]

94
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:10,590
- You can take off your scarf.
- Sulli's such an angel.

95
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:12,760
She's such an angel.
You have to have a good master.

96
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:15,820
It makes the life so much better.
I'm going to be so loyal to her.

97
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:19,210
- What else can I do for you?
- Didn't you say that you were thirsty?

98
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:21,510
- You can talk to him in casual speech.
- In casual speech?

99
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,050
- Speak to him in casual speech.
- This is your chance.

100
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:26,600
- You're just playing a game.
- Think of me as one of your friends.

101
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,620
- In that case...
- Think of me as being younger than you.

102
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,260
Just order him by his name.

103
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:34,640
Kim Jong Kook!

104
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:37,790
Yes, Master.

105
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,880
- Orange juice...
- Yes, I understand.

106
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,580
- 'Get it for me'.
- Will you get it for me?

107
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,330
'I really want some right now'.

108
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,430
- I really want some!
- Yes, I understand.

109
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:52,180
What kind would you like?

110
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:54,350
Would you like it in a can?
Or what other kind can I get for you?

111
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:57,130
- Tell him to use your own judgment.
- You can make the call.

112
00:05:57,130 --> 00:05:59,350
Yes, I understand. Why do
you keep telling her what to say?

113
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:02,120
I didn't say anything to her.
I'm just talking to myself.

114
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,690
Why do you keep feeding her
the lines?

115
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:07,110
Here's the caramel macchiato.

116
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:13,690
[Blank Ji Hyo's speedy service
to her master.]

117
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:16,060
That looks really refreshing.

118
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:20,260
I told them to make it extra good because
Kang Gary was going to be drinking it.

119
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:23,140
- You can take off your coat, Ji Hyo.
- Thank you, Gary.

120
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:27,830
You're not going to eat it?
You're not eating it?

121
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:30,070
Then should I throw it away?

122
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:33,650
Wow... look at how well
he treats Ji Hyo.

123
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:37,600
- There's nothing you won't do for her.
- I knew a day like this was going to come.

124
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:40,620
- What? Are there two straws?
- Of course.

125
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:43,630
Here. How about you and I
each take a sip?

126
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:45,280
That sounds good.

127
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,310
Aren't you going to drink it?
You're not drinking it?

128
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:50,860
[You just wait until we get to Shanghai...]

129
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:52,380
Then you can keep your coat on
until we get to Shanghai!

130
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:55,350
One sip for Ji Hyo!

131
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:01,250
- I haven't seen that in a while.
- Been three years since they've done that.

132
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:04,880
- You two look so comfortable doing that.
- We've played the stick cookie game twice.

133
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,890
You two look so natural doing that.
As if that's a no big deal.

134
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:08,730
You can take your coat off, Ji Hyo.

135
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:11,100
- Wow... he's so nice to her.
- Thank you.

136
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,330
Thank you so much.

137
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:15,050
- There you are.
- Maybe I shouldn't have worn this.

138
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:18,310
- Wow, that was good.
- Can I take my coat off?

139
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:20,730
No, but you can take
your scarf off.

140
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:22,400
[Kwang Soo is allowed to take off
his scarf for completing the mission.]

141
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:24,780
[I want to take my earmuffs off.]

142
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:29,740
Shout out, 'I want you, Kang Gary' five times
loud enough for everyone to hear.

143
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:33,300
[Ugh, my head...]

144
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:35,950
Loud enough for
those people to hear you.

145
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:37,700
Why aren't we heading off
to Shanghai yet?

146
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:40,560
- Ji Hyo's about to do her mission.
- Really?

147
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:44,940
[As soon as the last item comes off,
she escapes her life as a slave.]

148
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:46,820
What?
That she loves Kang Gary?

149
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:48,780
[Fine. It's no big deal...]

150
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,520
Everyone!

151
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:56,690
Are you guys going public
with your relationship?

152
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:01,320
- Please make room for her announcement.
- Yes.

153
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,810
Aren't you going to do it!

154
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:10,120
[Will she say it?]

155
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,040
I'll make my confession
here and now.

156
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:15,560
You have to say it five times.
Ready, go.

157
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:20,640
- I want you, Kang Gary!
- One.

158
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:23,800
- Not loud enough, is it?
- Yes!

159
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:30,750
-  I want you, Kang Gary!
- I don't think Shanghai can hear you yet.

160
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:36,020
Are you feeling shy?

161
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,750
Everyone, please join in.

162
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:44,470
I want you, Kang Gary!

163
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:47,370
[Ecstatic]

164
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:52,990
- You all heard her, didn't you?
- I want you, Ha Dong Hoon!

165
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:56,710
- I want you, Ha Dong Hoon!
- I want you all to tell the whole world!

166
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:00,110
Hey!
You've just humiliated me.

167
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:06,550
[After their arrival at the airport,
everyone completes their mission.]

168
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:08,790
- Wow, it's so hot.
- That was too funny.

169
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:11,410
We will be leaving for Shanghai soon.

170
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:15,290
There are only two tickets to participate
in the competition.

171
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:20,790
Four of you will have the honor of playing in
the Asian Dream Cup through a nomination.

172
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:23,590
Everyone will now board
the plane for Shanghai.

173
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:25,240
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

174
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:34,680
[Heading off to Shanghai
with all the cheerful farewells!]

175
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:36,930
Thank you.

176
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:43,690
[Asian Dream Cup...
We are coming for you!]

177
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:46,600
[This is Shanghai!]

178
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:51,360
[Second capitol of China.
This is Shanghai!]

179
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:55,060
[A place where the global culture
and tradition lives in coexistence.]

180
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:59,620
[Running Man arriving
at the press conference.]

181
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:04,180
[A passionate welcome.
The start of their press conference.]

182
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:11,190
[What are they predicting
the final score to be at the game?]

183
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:13,300
I'm not sure how it's
going to turn out.

184
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:16,640
It all depends on how well
the Running Man Team does for us.

185
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:19,260
[Huge burden]

186
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:24,720
<i>[If the Running Man Team participates, then
there's a higher chance Shanghai will win.]</i>

187
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:32,410
He's not the same as he was last year
when we played on the same team.

188
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:37,420
One, two, three.
Fighting!

189
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:38,730
[Here's to fair play at the upcoming game!]

190
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:48,900
[The morning of Asian Dream Cup]

191
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:54,650
- What is this?
- What's going on in here?

192
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,380
What's this?

193
00:10:58,070 --> 00:10:59,640
I guess we'll be sitting
with our own teammates.

194
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,910
Director.

195
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:03,420
[Captain Park joining
the Running Man Team.]

196
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:05,120
- Let's sit over here.
- Come here, Sulli.

197
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:09,450
How is your condition this morning?

198
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:11,290
- Are you doing well?
- I got a very good night of sleep.

199
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:14,290
- Yes, I slept very well last night.
- Jong Kook didn't sleep very well last night.

200
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:18,480
From what I can see, he hasn't
been able to recover his condition.

201
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,910
- He's not adjusted to the time difference.
- What is he talking about?

202
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:23,500
There's only an hour difference.

203
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:26,070
- There's only a one hour difference.
- But there's still a time difference.

204
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:31,160
Anyway, since our Captain Park is going to
choose who'll be in the game...

205
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:33,370
Would it be possible for all of us
to participate in the game?

206
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:34,850
- All of you?
- Yes.

207
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:36,410
No, that's not going to happen.

208
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,360
[Predicting that he won't
be in the game?]

209
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:43,480
[That actually makes him feel
more at peace...]

210
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,750
I will now reveal to you
your Shanghai mission.

211
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:51,410
You will play a total of two mission to
choose two players for the game.

212
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:56,030
At the end of each mission,
one player will be picked for the game.

213
00:11:56,030 --> 00:12:01,110
- One team currently has no captain.
- I think he nominated himself as the captain.

214
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:04,620
Give us a captain too, since
Gu Ja Chul isn't going to be on today.

215
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:07,180
- Give us a new captain.
- This person has strong leadership skills.

216
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:09,920
- Who is it?
- He's a world famous soccer player.

217
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,900
- A world famous star?
- Call out to him in English.

218
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,830
- In English?
- Excuse me!

219
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:16,600
Is he an American?

220
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:22,560
[A manly man with dignity...
waiting behind the closed doors.]

221
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:26,890
- Welcome!
- Come in please!

222
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:29,480
Welcome to Running Man!

223
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:35,220
[Another captain makes his way
into the room!]

224
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:39,600
[Patrice Evra!]

225
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,640
Evra!

226
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,570
[Ji Sung's other half, Evra is here!]

227
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,130
[French floating wingback currently
playing for the Manchester United.]

228
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:56,040
[Known as Ji Sung's other half
during Ji Sung's days on the team!]

229
00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:01,290
[Park Ji Sung's best friend,
Patrice Evra!]

230
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:03,300
He says that I'm stupid.

231
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:07,760
- My brother!
- Evra!

232
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:11,340
- My brother, Evra!
- His face is so small!

233
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:13,360
[Happy to see each other again even though
they met at the press conference.]

234
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,290
- Come shake his hand.
- Greet each other.

235
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:17,900
- Evra is here.
- Hello.

236
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:23,720
- I can't believe that he's here.
- Evra, this is Sulli.

237
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,250
- Hello.
- Hey, Evra.

238
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:27,780
[Greeting Ji Sung with familiarity.]

239
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:30,490
- Evra.
- This is your name tag.

240
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:33,090
[Running Man name tag on
his own back!]

241
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,610
- I have to put this on your back.
- I'm not stupid.

242
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:36,970
- I'm not stupid.
- Oh, you're not stupid?

243
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:40,140
[The very first Korean word
that he learned from Ji Sung.]

244
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:41,760
This is all because of you!

245
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:48,480
[Welcome to Running Man!]

246
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,770
Evra is like a member of our own family.

247
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:52,490
He's so familiar with all of this.

248
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,930
Why don't we all give him a
round of applause?

249
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:58,320
[Another world famous star making
his appearance on Running Man!]

250
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,390
- Thanks, thanks.
- 'Thanks, thanks'...

251
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:05,660
- Isn't he good looking?
- He's really good looking.

252
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:08,230
- His eyes twinkle.
- You're so handsome.

253
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:10,080
Thanks, thanks.

254
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:12,650
[Am I good looking?]

255
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:16,110
Has Evra ever watched Running Man before?
Does he know about the show?

256
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:17,640
Have you ever seen this program?

257
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:23,940
- Yes, and I want to greet the Korean people.
- He says he wants to greet the Korean fans.

258
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:26,770
Republic of Korea... I love you.

259
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,340
[Lighting fire to the atmosphere
with one simple statement!]

260
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:33,670
- We love you too!
- Me too! Me too!

261
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:37,090
[Pay attention to Evra's entertainment
skills that we'll be showing in a little bit.]

262
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:39,460
Can you ask how old he
thinks Suk Jin is?

263
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,300
- What?
- What?

264
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:49,080
- My age...
- Yes?

265
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:51,410
- You guess my age.
- Ah, your age?

266
00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:56,820
- Thirty...
- Dirty?

267
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,630
- Thirty eight.
- Ah, thirty eight?

268
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,940
[What? This face?]

269
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:04,280
[Then what about Kwang Soo?]

270
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,710
I think he looks 42.

271
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:08,400
42.

272
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,070
[The old man...]

273
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:17,430
It's because you're big.

274
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:20,360
- Evra, let's you and I be friends.
- Evra, that was great!

275
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,800
But that was too much.

276
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:26,970
It's so nice for Evra to come join us in
the little free time that he has.

277
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:29,680
He is amazing as our new captain.

278
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:33,960
- He's better than Ji Sung.
- Jong Kook... are you going to take that?

279
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,090
How can you say such a thing?

280
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:38,730
You may not get to run even if
you're picked to join the game.

281
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:45,450
[Park Ji Sung is the one with the liberty
to decide who gets to join the game.]

282
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,510
Come on, you can't do that.

283
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:50,810
I'm prepared to do whatever it is
that you ask of me to do.

284
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:53,960
I played mostly the One-Top position
when I played soccer.

285
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:56,390
[Say what?]

286
00:15:58,370 --> 00:16:01,390
[One-Top= The highest offensive position.]

287
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,970
Why wouldn't I know?
Why wouldn't I know what One-Top is?

288
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:09,620
When I told him that you may be playing,
Evra just said that we'll lose if you do.

289
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:12,160
No. It's not going to
be like that, Evra.

290
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:16,270
You should see how well I can run.
I'm very well suited for One-Tops.

291
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:18,350
Okay, then.
Let's see how well you do.

292
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:21,000
- What will you do, Jong Kook?
- I'll do whatever is ordered of me.

293
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,420
In that case, a jjajangmyun...

294
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:27,180
[You just said that you'll do
whatever is ordered of you.]

295
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:29,040
Just order it for us.

296
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:31,710
[Kindly translating even
the jokes to him.]

297
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:35,250
What about you, Kwang Soo?
What are you going to do?

298
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:37,830
- I too am...
- Why don't you just cheer?

299
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:40,150
- I can do whatever I'm told.
- You should do this...

300
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,630
You can play second base.

301
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:43,900
[Isn't that baseball?]

302
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:46,050
- You're telling me to be a ball boy?
- A ball boy.

303
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:52,660
We will now conduct a variety of training
sessions to determine the last two open spots.

304
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:54,700
Okay, we'll start off with
the first training.

305
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:57,150
It's called, Shanghai Marble.

306
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:58,380
[First player nomination mission-
Shanghai Marble.]

307
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,450
[If it's Shanghai Marble...]

308
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:04,790
- What are we going to have to do?
- Isn't that Dong Wan?

309
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:07,900
[The king of disguises, Dong Wan!]

310
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:11,200
[Disguising himself into the famous
game character...]

311
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,690
- He's a man?
- Yes.

312
00:17:17,850 --> 00:17:20,480
[Evra bursting into laughter.]

313
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:23,440
Evra really seems to like
Dong Wan's getup.

314
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:27,660
He looks better than
either of these two ladies.

315
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:31,080
[Seriously?]

316
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,240
He says that Dong Wan is
the prettiest in here.

317
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:35,360
[You're the best!]

318
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:40,370
<i>What you're looking at right now is
the Shanghai Marble board.</i>

319
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:42,320
<i>Do you see the board pieces
for your team?</i>

320
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,930
<i>Park Ji Sung and Evra's faces are on
top of each team's piece.</i>

321
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:50,580
<i>You will move the number of spaces on the
board that you roll on the die for a mission.</i>

322
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:51,870
[Must complete the mission
that you land on.]

323
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:55,000
<i>If you fail your mission, you have to
pay Go Dong Wan's Shanghai bank</i>

324
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,110
<i>a toll fee of 1,000 Yuan.</i>

325
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:00,420
<i>But if you succeed your mission</i>

326
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:03,650
<i>you don't need to pay the fee,
and get to roll the dice again.</i>

327
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:07,170
- Okay, I understand.
- Each team will be given 3,000 Yuan.

328
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:08,880
- 3,000 Yuan?
- 3,000 Yuan.

329
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:14,340
<i>The captain that wins the Shanghai Marble
will earn one slot for their teammate.</i>

330
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:17,180
- Evra, you can roll the die.
- Right here?

331
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:19,480
[Evra taking the first turn to
roll the die on the board.]

332
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:22,570
- Two.
- Two!

333
00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:25,230
The lucky key.

334
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:27,370
[Landing on the Lucky Key?]

335
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:30,480
- Aren't we supposed to go that way?
- Doesn't it usually go that way?

336
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,840
[That's not the direction
to move the piece...]

337
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:36,070
[Moving two spaces in the right direction.]

338
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:37,790
No, no.

339
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:41,350
No, this way.

340
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:43,130
No, I'll just go.

341
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:47,930
He's annoyed now.

342
00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:50,520
- Seoul.
- I bet Seoul would be better.

343
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:53,530
[Shanghai Marble- Seoul Mission.
Ddakji.]

344
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:55,810
- It's a ddakji game?
- The first Seoul mission is...

345
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,890
- What is it?
- It's 'Beat the ultimate ddakji'.

346
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,980
[Beat the ultimate ddakji!]

347
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:01,180
You have to hit that and flip it over.

348
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:05,490
[Must beat two players of the other team
to pass the space!]

349
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:08,150
[Demonstrating the game to Evra
who's never seen ddakji before.]

350
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:10,640
- I have to turn that over?
- Yes.

351
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,080
You've got to flip it.

352
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:15,690
You should tell Evra that he needs to
hit it right in the middle.

353
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:18,430
- It's not flipping over.
- Is it really hard?

354
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:20,350
- Yeah, you try it.
- Let me see if I can help it.

355
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,470
- He's good.
- He's got the feel of it.

356
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:35,000
[Oh? Showing some skills in the game?]

357
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Good.

358
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,940
- Ji Hyo, show them what you've got.
- You've only got one chance, okay?

359
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:41,460
Hey, hey, hey...

360
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:46,270
- She only has one chance.
- Evra wants you to be quiet.

361
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,540
There you go!

362
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,340
There you go!

363
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:58,830
[Reacting like an elder would?]

364
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:01,800
- Evra, that's Kwang Soo.
- Kwang Soo.

365
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,610
- Giraffe.
- Come on, Kwang Soo.

366
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:05,100
He's a long guy.

367
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:09,630
He's a comedian.

368
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:13,680
42. He's 42.

369
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:17,800
I'm 29!
I'm 29 years old!

370
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:20,570
- No, no. You 18 years old.
- He's 18?

371
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:25,020
[Since he's on his own team,
flattering him by telling him he's 18.]

372
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:34,060
We have to beat two people.

373
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:36,550
- You need to flip one, Suk Jin.
- I know. I need to get one.

374
00:20:39,730 --> 00:20:41,050
I get another try since I caught it.

375
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:44,910
[Anther try for catching it?]

376
00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:49,990
[A new rule?
Catching it gives you three tries?]

377
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:51,650
- Catching it gives you another try.
- One more?

378
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:53,480
What kind of a rule is that?

379
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:04,690
[He catches it again!]

380
00:21:07,530 --> 00:21:11,110
[Is this Big-nosed Brother's secret skill?]

381
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:13,210
How did Suk Jin catch that?

382
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:16,320
[Anyways, this will be his last try.]

383
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:19,070
- Don't think about it too much.
- You have to slam it down harder.

384
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,540
You have to hit it in the middle.

385
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:25,370
[Now it's Ddakji King, Mr. Capable's turn.]

386
00:21:25,370 --> 00:21:27,450
Ddakji King.
He's Ddakji King.

387
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:29,980
Hey, hey.
That's me.

388
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:35,410
[I'll show you how it's done.]

389
00:21:45,810 --> 00:21:48,770
[Two out of five people must flip it to pass.
Evra Team's Jong Kook easily succeeds.]

390
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:50,880
How about a round of applause for Evra!

391
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:53,830
[Evra of Evra's Team is the final player.]

392
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:58,540
[His first encounter with ddakji...
He must flip it over for his team to pass.]

393
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,200
This is going to be difficult.

394
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:05,390
[There he goes!]

395
00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:26,260
[Evra flips over the ultimate ddakji!]

396
00:22:27,290 --> 00:22:29,180
[My goodness...]

397
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:35,200
[Evra's Team passes the Seoul ddakji mission
in the Shanghai Marble game!]

398
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,820
That's unreal.

399
00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:41,980
Unbelievable!

400
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:44,580
- Thanks.
- What does 'unbelievable' mean?

401
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:49,730
Thus, Evra's Team can go on to the next round
without having to pay the toll fee.

402
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,770
Okay, it's Park Ji Sung's turn.

403
00:22:55,770 --> 00:22:57,710
- Is it my turn?
- Okay, Captain Park!

404
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:59,880
- Get number two.
- Just throw the die!

405
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:02,260
We're good at the second one.
We're good at the ddakji game.

406
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,240
Number three!

407
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:10,770
Okay, Sao Paulo!

408
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:13,800
[What will Sao Paolo mission be?]

409
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:17,280
Okay, Sao Paolo!

410
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:20,210
- What's that?
- We have to play it with our feet?

411
00:23:20,210 --> 00:23:22,430
Come on, that can't be done
with your feet.

412
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:26,560
That's the first time I've heard
Ji Sung say anything like that.

413
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:28,610
Ji Sung normally doesn't say
things like that.

414
00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:30,900
Just one of you needs to succeed
for you to pass this mission.

415
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:32,960
- Just one person?
- Challenge!

416
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:34,510
Challenge.

417
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:37,580
You have to get the ball a little higher
to get it in the goal.

418
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:40,940
You have to get a clean shot for it
to have a chance of making it in.

419
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:43,740
- You're good at foot volleyball.
- But that's not going to be as easy.

420
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:46,400
With it being so high, it won't be easy.
Challenge.

421
00:23:57,370 --> 00:23:59,610
[Ah, it unfortunately
bounces off the rim!]

422
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:03,150
[That's not going to be easy.]

423
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:05,430
It can't be that hard.

424
00:24:09,430 --> 00:24:12,970
My foot must've lost its mind.

425
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:19,990
[Everyone's focus is on the open slots
for the player nominee.]

426
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:21,700
You seem to be very
stressed out by that.

427
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,530
- You seem to be very stressed by it.
- Challenge!

428
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:26,960
- You can do it, Sulli.
- I can do this.

429
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,720
Good job.
You looked pretty doing it.

430
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,060
He told her that she did good
because she looked pretty doing it.

431
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:37,810
- What is that supposed to mean?
- Your face looked pretty when you did it.

432
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:39,300
- Then that's all that matters.
- Challenge.

433
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:41,520
- Gary may make it.
- He's good at things like this.

434
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:44,380
- He's good at stuff like this.
- Gary can do it.

435
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:47,550
- If it's Gary...
- Challenge.

436
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:49,570
[Captain Evra correcting his stance.]

437
00:24:49,570 --> 00:24:52,510
- This is a difficult shot.
- Are you trying to teach me?

438
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:54,310
[I can be strict.]

439
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:07,130
[The ball goes in and bounces back out!]

440
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,510
Wow, that was such a close shot.

441
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:11,830
I thought that was going to
make it in for sure.

442
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:14,480
[Ji Sung Team's last hope,
Captain Park!]

443
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,560
- That's harder than it looks.
- Come on, Ji Sung.

444
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:18,000
Please, Ji Sung.

445
00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:23,570
It definitely is hard.

446
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,660
- You didn't say, 'challenge'.
- No, I didn't say that.

447
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:27,670
[One more chance for not having said,
'challenge'?]

448
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,980
[Captain Evra coming out to call foul.]

449
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:32,980
Okay, okay.
I got it.

450
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:35,300
- He's really strict.
- Tell him not to step on the line.

451
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:46,750
Since I'm already mad...

452
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:49,310
seeing Kwang Soo's face over there
is making me want to hit it.

453
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:50,570
Why would you want to do that?

454
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:52,680
Challenge.

455
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:57,850
[If he makes the goal, then the
team passes the Sao Paolo mission!]

456
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:11,470

the Sao Paolo mission.]

457

[Having Evra give it a try?]

458
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:17,830
I really thought that Ji Sung
and Gary would make it in.

459
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:20,040
I don't think it's going to be easy.

460
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:33,330
[Immediately going into his acting mode?]

461
00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:34,860
Did he say that it was because
his foot was hurting?

462
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:37,750
- He's so funny.
- Evra really is so funny.

463
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:39,170
Why is he so funny?

464
00:26:47,450 --> 00:26:50,300
[Evra succeeds in scoring the ball!]

465
00:26:51,690 --> 00:26:54,360
- Evra!
- Evra!

466

[Captain Evra full of
confidence and cheer.]

467

[How did he do that?]

468
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:04,360
- That's awesome.
- How did he do that?

469
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:06,410
- It was easy.
- What were you doing?

470
00:27:06,410 --> 00:27:08,370
What's wrong with you, Ji Sung?

471
00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:11,510
[Amazing... succeeds at
ddakji and the ball scoring?]

472
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:15,100
- That was shocking.
- Seriously.

473
00:27:16,430 --> 00:27:20,880
[Team Ji Sung must pay 1,000 Yuan in
toll fees for failing their Sao Paolo mission.]

474
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:23,750
He's frighteningly funny.

475
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:25,970
He's frighteningly funny.

476
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,910
[When did he learn to say that?]

00:27:29,910 --> 00:27:31,240
Frighteningly funny?

- Four!

480

Pick one.

- 25.
- Challenge.

654
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:05,960
[Hits Kwang Soo in the back.]

655
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:12,080
[Icon of misfortune
no matter where he goes...]

656
00:38:13,590 --> 00:38:16,060
[Ultimately, Big-nosed Brother
contributes 0 to the score.]

657
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:17,550
Why were you standing
back there!

658
00:38:17,550 --> 00:38:19,900
Why are you yelling at me when I was
just standing there quietly!

659
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:21,510
Why were you standing back there?

660
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:23,820
Just get out of the way.
You just get in the way.

661
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:26,720
I was just standing in my spot!

662
00:38:29,850 --> 00:38:31,910
- They need 25 more, right?
- 25.

663
00:38:32,210 --> 00:38:34,220
[How will Evra do on his first
experience with the mat?]

664
00:38:40,050 --> 00:38:42,510
[Who is that guy?]

665
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:50,810
[Does he have an acupuncture mat
at his home in France?]

666
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:54,560
[Continuing to jump!]

667
00:38:56,710 --> 00:39:00,970
[Now that the mission is won...
the pain comes to find him!]

668
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:05,300
[You are something else...]

669
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,980
[Captain Evra is the icon of success!]

670
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:10,710
Evra did it!

671
00:39:10,970 --> 00:39:13,870
[It's good for your health...]

672
00:39:13,870 --> 00:39:16,740
Wow, Evra!
Are you okay?

673
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:21,510
[Shanghai Marble, Bangkok mission-
Massage jump roping is a success!]

674
00:39:21,510 --> 00:39:23,050
- It's a success.
- Okay!

675
00:39:23,050 --> 00:39:25,630
Evra's really entertaining.

676
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:30,820
[How about joining the Korean
entertainment industry once you retire?]

677
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:32,810
[Team Ji Sung's turn to roll the die.]

678
00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:35,540
One!

679
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:40,710
What is it?

680
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:43,050
[What will be the Lucky Key's
mission be this time?]

681
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:46,920
It's another Captain vs. Captain game?

682
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:49,160
- What is it this time?
- It's a heading competition.

683
00:39:50,130 --> 00:39:56,660
Each captain must head the ball to his teammate
and the team that does the most wins.

684
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:59,570
- Gary would be the best.
- Let Gary do it.

685
00:39:59,570 --> 00:40:00,900
We choose Gary.

686
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:02,800
- Why don't you go first?
- You want us to go first?

687
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,480
- It's just one try, right?
- Let's practice it once.

688
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:07,290
Yes, it's one single try.

689
00:40:07,290 --> 00:40:13,380
One, two, three, four, five, six...
He's good.

690
00:40:18,230 --> 00:40:20,160
[While dancing?]

691
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:26,430
[Good job, Gary!
Feeling a win coming their way!]

692
00:40:26,430 --> 00:40:29,380
- Good job.
- I can do that while dancing!

693
00:40:30,490 --> 00:40:31,900
- I think Kwang Soo can do it.
- You try it, Kwang Soo.

694
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:34,440
[Team Evra-
Captain Evra and Elder Kwang Soo.]

695
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:36,780
We can do this, Evra.
Let's show them!

696
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:43,240
[Kwang Soo's pretty good himself?]

697
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:46,830
- There you go!
- Stop.

698
00:40:46,830 --> 00:40:47,810
[This team is good too!]

699
00:40:48,470 --> 00:40:50,970
- You just need to put your head out there.
- Okay, Gary!

700
00:40:50,970 --> 00:40:53,580
- Shall we go first?
- Keep your eye on the ball.

701
00:40:53,950 --> 00:40:56,400
[It's for real this time!
Which team will win?]

702
00:40:56,410 --> 00:40:59,600
- We have to win this round.
- This is nerve wrecking!

703
00:41:02,010 --> 00:41:03,340
Hey!
Don't touch.

704
00:41:04,930 --> 00:41:06,340
This is nerve wrecking.

705
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:07,900
[Team Ji Sung-
Start the heading relay!]

706
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:14,350
One, two, three, four, five, six...

707
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:21,930
[Oh... can he make it?]

708
00:41:21,930 --> 00:41:23,910
Seven...

709
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:29,410
[Ji Sung tries his best
to receive the ball...]

710
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:33,520
[Team Ji Sung scores nine!]

711
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:37,220
[Did so much better
during the practice round.]

712
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,630
Relax and calm down.

713
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:43,730
[Team Evra needs to beat nine to win.]

714
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:45,610
You get really nervous when you
start playing for real.

715
00:41:45,610 --> 00:41:47,530
- Don't be nervous.
- Let's go!

716
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,420
Evra!

717
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:57,170
One, two, three, four...

718
00:41:57,170 --> 00:42:01,310
Five, six, seven...

719
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:05,440
[Will seven be the end for them?]

720
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,220
Five, six, seven...

721
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:13,000
[Receives the eighth shot!]

722
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:16,360
[If they get one more!]

723
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:18,360
Eight!

724
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:21,020
Nine, ten!

725
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:23,650
Seven, eight, nine, ten!

726
00:42:23,650 --> 00:42:27,250
[Team Evra wins the heading relay game!]

727
00:42:30,050 --> 00:42:32,560
[Hurray, Captain Evra!]

728
00:42:34,930 --> 00:42:40,070
Evra!
Evra!

729
00:42:40,070 --> 00:42:43,040
[Shanghai Marble-
Team Evra is the ultimate winner!]

730
00:42:43,530 --> 00:42:46,010
[Even celebrates with Dong Wan.]

731
00:42:51,870 --> 00:42:56,790
Captain Evra just won himself a spot for
one of his members in the game.

732
00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:03,330
[Finally making their move to the arena!]

733
00:43:07,390 --> 00:43:09,310
Time to hit the slate.

734
00:43:09,890 --> 00:43:12,250
One, two, three.

735
00:43:18,620 --> 00:43:21,760
[Shanghai Hongkou stadium]

736
00:43:23,210 --> 00:43:26,560
[Entering the stage where the
Dream Cup will take place in three hours.]

737
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:30,660
- It's really hot out here.
- It really is hot.

738
00:43:31,290 --> 00:43:33,470
Who would've ever thought that I would be
walking up behind Evra like this?

739
00:43:35,350 --> 00:43:37,060
This is so cool.

740
00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:39,950
[Half excitement, and half nervousness.
Stepping onto the field of dreams...]

741
00:43:41,510 --> 00:43:44,820
Okay, everyone.
This is Shanghai Hongkou Stadium.

742
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:46,610
This is amazing.

743
00:43:46,620 --> 00:43:49,700
There's only one spot left to fill.

744
00:43:50,570 --> 00:43:54,730
Team Ji Sung has two spots,
and Team Ev has one spot.

745
00:43:54,730 --> 00:43:57,780
What do you mean, Team Ev?
It's Team Evra.

746
00:43:58,380 --> 00:44:06,010
You will play a very simple game to determine
which team will get the last remaining spot.

747
00:44:06,010 --> 00:44:09,010
[Starting their second training session to
determine who'll get the last remaining spot.]

748
00:44:09,010 --> 00:44:12,680
[Free kick photo zone.]

749
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:19,590
[As the opposing team kicks the goal,
have to stand in front of the goal and smile.]

750
00:44:19,590 --> 00:44:20,970
- Oh my God...
- On top of that...

751
00:44:20,970 --> 00:44:22,910
The ball can't make the goal
in order for you to succeed.

752
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:25,280
So block the ball while we
keep the smile on our faces?

753
00:44:26,210 --> 00:44:27,450
Let's go!

754
00:44:27,450 --> 00:44:30,220
[Final mission-
Free kick photo zone- Start!]

755
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:33,420
- Is this the penalty kick?
- Yes.

756
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:37,840
- This is the official penalty kick spot.
- But how are we going to make this?

757
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:39,590
No, we can't make that.

758
00:44:39,590 --> 00:44:40,840
Okay, I'll try kicking it.

759
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:42,780
I'll try to make the next goal.

760
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:44,470
[Yoo Hyuk shoots!]

761
00:44:46,860 --> 00:44:49,850
[Even though Captain Park blocks it,
the ball still makes it in!]

762
00:44:49,860 --> 00:44:52,860
You can't just kick it carelessly.

763
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,520
[Mr. Kim-Leave it makes his attempt.]

764
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:57,550
Let's see how Jong Kook does.

765
00:44:59,690 --> 00:45:02,520
[Hmm...]

766
00:45:02,530 --> 00:45:05,480
[As previously stated,
he just really loves the game.]

767
00:45:06,470 --> 00:45:09,870
[Captain Evra tying his
shoelaces for him?]

768
00:45:10,870 --> 00:45:12,110
Can I kick it?

769
00:45:12,110 --> 00:45:14,820
[Team Evra takes the first challenge
in the Free Kick Photo Zone mission.]

770
00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:17,170
You have to smile big.
You're getting your picture taken.

771
00:45:17,170 --> 00:45:19,250
- You're getting your picture taken.
- I'm so scared.

772
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:22,830
Smile nice and big and
don't pay any attention to the ball.

773
00:45:22,830 --> 00:45:25,220
How can we not pay any attention to it?
You try standing over here.

774
00:45:25,220 --> 00:45:27,610
Okay, here we go.

775
00:45:27,610 --> 00:45:29,870
Smile!
Smile!

776
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:37,460
[Their hearts are about to
beat out of their chests.]

777
00:45:39,490 --> 00:45:43,560
Okay, we're going to take the picture.
One, two, three.

778
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:45,360
[Ji Sung's kick.]

779
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:54,530
Kwang Soo, I'm sorry!

780
00:45:56,210 --> 00:45:58,110
[Captain Evra getting
frighteningly angry.]

781
00:45:58,110 --> 00:46:00,110
It's because you're just too tall.

782
00:46:00,110 --> 00:46:01,870
It's because you're too tall.

783
00:46:02,330 --> 00:46:03,940
[Ji, you just wait...]

784
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:08,820
Song Ji Hyo was the only one smiling.

785
00:46:08,820 --> 00:46:10,140
[Picture shows that only Blank Ji
had a smile on her face.]

786
00:46:11,550 --> 00:46:13,580
[Both eyes shut tight with
his teeth tightly gritted.]

787
00:46:14,740 --> 00:46:16,220
Okay, I'm going to take the picture now.

788
00:46:16,220 --> 00:46:19,600
- One, two, three!
- I'm going to kick it real hard.

789
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:21,430
[What did you say?]

790
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:32,380
[Extremely fierce kick!]

791
00:46:32,380 --> 00:46:35,190
- Wait! Is he allowed to do that?
- What is he doing?

792
00:46:38,850 --> 00:46:41,300
[Captain Evra breaking out in rage
for the second time.]

793
00:46:43,590 --> 00:46:45,440
[You just wait and see, Ji...]

794
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:49,700
[Oh?
But they were all smiling?]

795
00:46:49,710 --> 00:46:52,790
[With the exception of one.
Kangaroo?]

796
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:58,610
[Sorry.]

797
00:47:00,130 --> 00:47:02,640
[Team Ji Sung's turn.]

798
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:04,640
Ji!
Come on, come on.

799
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:06,070
Wait, hang on.

800
00:47:08,020 --> 00:47:09,960
- Revenge.
- Revenge.

801
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:12,350
- Revenge.
- I hope he takes it easy.

802
00:47:14,260 --> 00:47:17,530
[A terrorizing fake shot.]

803
00:47:19,740 --> 00:47:22,230
Jae Suk just turns his back.

804
00:47:22,230 --> 00:47:24,170
- I don't know if I can do this.
- It's so scary.

805
00:47:33,230 --> 00:47:36,020
[Oh? He makes the goal.]

806
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:37,940
I thought I was going to take
the ball in my face.

807
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:44,840
[Even though it was a fail because
the ball made the goal...]

808
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:47,860
[He still manages to protect his face
that he's so proud of.]

809
00:47:51,310 --> 00:47:53,170
- You really are so ugly.
- He's a scaredy cat.

810
00:47:57,070 --> 00:47:59,260
It's not like this is the first time
that I've acted this scared.

811
00:48:00,130 --> 00:48:02,250
[Team Ji Sung's second try.]

812
00:48:02,250 --> 00:48:03,940
Okay, I'm going to take the picture.

813
00:48:03,940 --> 00:48:07,680
[Too scared to give a big smile...]

814
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:12,020
[Makes the goal again.]

815
00:48:15,350 --> 00:48:18,380
[Just ends up guarding his face again.]

816
00:48:18,380 --> 00:48:21,300
- Jae Suk...
- What are you doing, Jae Suk?

817
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:23,010
Why does he keep doing that?

818
00:48:23,010 --> 00:48:25,450
[Putting up his guard?]

819
00:48:26,530 --> 00:48:29,840
[If Yoo Hyuk had just smiled...]

820
00:48:30,860 --> 00:48:33,300
[Team Evra steps up to
the challenge again.]

821
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:35,650
Kwang Soo, be careful, okay?

822
00:48:35,650 --> 00:48:37,720
[Targeting on Kwang Soo?]

823
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:39,190
That's it, Ji Sung.

824
00:48:44,090 --> 00:48:46,090
There it is.
I saw the expression on his face.

825
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:50,100
[There it is!
Scaredy-Kwang Soo's expression.]

826
00:48:51,510 --> 00:48:56,460
[Everyone with a big smile on their faces...]

827
00:48:56,460 --> 00:48:58,400
[Frog Kwang?]

828
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:01,430
[Adding ten additional chins to his face.]

829
00:49:02,420 --> 00:49:04,330
- You have to relax.
- Okay.

830
00:49:04,330 --> 00:49:05,880
Smile.
Smile.

831
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:07,050
[Tea, Evra's second attempt.]

832
00:49:07,050 --> 00:49:09,860
- One, two, three.
- Even Evra seems a little nervous.

833
00:49:13,780 --> 00:49:16,380
[Frog Kwang makes his
return once more.]

834
00:49:19,150 --> 00:49:21,500
[The ball didn't make the goal...]

835
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:25,860
[Even though everyone
managed to smile...]

836
00:49:25,860 --> 00:49:29,770
[Frog Kwang only looks like he's crying.]

837
00:49:35,340 --> 00:49:38,920
[Frog Kwang getting criticized
for his expression.]

838
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:43,320
That's how I normally smile.

839
00:49:44,390 --> 00:49:47,980
[Giraffe's smile.]

840
00:49:47,980 --> 00:49:51,710
I'm going to smile for real this time.
Evra, I'm going to smile for sure this time.

841
00:49:52,310 --> 00:49:54,050
[Okay, you just give it a try.]

842
00:49:56,180 --> 00:49:59,300
[Another hurray.]

843
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:02,830
[Throwing up his arms to guard his face
no matter what happens.]

844
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:05,290
The ball isn't even coming our way.

845
00:50:05,290 --> 00:50:12,230
[I have to put the guards up.
My face is very precious...]

846
00:50:13,870 --> 00:50:16,200
Okay, fine.
Let's get it done this time.

847
00:50:16,700 --> 00:50:18,530
Come on, smile.

848
00:50:18,570 --> 00:50:21,170
[Captain Evra concentrating on
black hole, Kwang Soo.]

849
00:50:21,170 --> 00:50:22,950
[Don't do that.]

850
00:50:22,950 --> 00:50:25,000
When did I do that?

851
00:50:25,900 --> 00:50:27,560
I didn't make an expression like that.

852
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:29,290
[Big brother Evra not able to
put his trust in the Giraffe.]

853
00:50:30,250 --> 00:50:33,420
- Want to try kicking the ball, Gary?
- Yeah, why don't you try it?

854
00:50:35,140 --> 00:50:37,560
- It's okay, I can do it.
- No, no, no...

855
00:50:37,570 --> 00:50:40,930
[Refusing his turn at the free kick.]

856
00:50:40,940 --> 00:50:43,290
Come on, Evra.

857
00:50:45,070 --> 00:50:46,700
Okay, I'm going to take
the picture now.

858
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:49,960
One, two, three.

859
00:50:57,560 --> 00:51:00,780
- That felt so good! That felt so good!
- Kim Jong Kook!

860
00:51:01,970 --> 00:51:04,510
No, no, no!
I smiled!

861
00:51:04,510 --> 00:51:06,490
[Picture verification.]

862
00:51:07,130 --> 00:51:09,900
[Shocked expression once again.]

863
00:51:12,120 --> 00:51:14,050
[Frustrated]

864
00:51:15,150 --> 00:51:16,850
That was a scare tactic.

865
00:51:17,590 --> 00:51:21,380
[Sulli is the next kicker?]

866
00:51:21,380 --> 00:51:23,690
[Realizing that Sulli can do it too
after seeing how scared they get?]

867
00:51:23,690 --> 00:51:26,560
One, two, three!

868
00:51:31,350 --> 00:51:34,240
[A hard hit to his long legs.]

869
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:38,540
Change!
Change!

870
00:51:47,350 --> 00:51:50,370
[Ah... there's the Frog Kwang again...]

871
00:51:50,370 --> 00:51:52,400
What now?
He's kicking it?

872
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:53,770
Here I go!

873
00:51:53,780 --> 00:51:55,820
[The amateur kicker for Team Evra is...]

874
00:51:55,830 --> 00:51:59,160
[Uncertain kick by the soccer loving
Mr. Kim-Leave it.]

875
00:52:03,330 --> 00:52:05,330
[Huh?
Blank Ji?]

876
00:52:11,010 --> 00:52:14,040
[Huh?]

877
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:16,730
[Since it was a fake tactic...]

878
00:52:19,300 --> 00:52:23,160
[Captain Evra starting to get a headache.]

879
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:28,830
[Luckily fails it...]

880
00:52:29,380 --> 00:52:31,200
Sorry.

881
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:34,350
[Telling her to leave the field?]

882
00:52:34,350 --> 00:52:36,980
[Cold Captain Evra.]

883
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:41,220
- It's Suk Jin's turn.
- I'll kick it.

884
00:52:41,220 --> 00:52:42,780
I don't know where it's going to go.

885
00:52:42,780 --> 00:52:44,420
[Next kicker is, Big-nosed Brother.]

886
00:52:48,980 --> 00:52:51,620
[Huh?
They may have succeeded...]

887
00:52:51,620 --> 00:52:53,140
We got it.

888
00:52:53,140 --> 00:52:56,310
[Ji Suk, Jae Suk and Gary succeeds...]

889
00:52:57,810 --> 00:53:00,110
[Huh?]

890
00:53:00,110 --> 00:53:02,450
[His eyes are closed, right?]

891
00:53:02,450 --> 00:53:04,370
That Ha Ha...

892
00:53:05,830 --> 00:53:07,320
Doesn't that count as a smile?

893
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:08,580
You have your eyes closed.

894
00:53:09,450 --> 00:53:13,580
[That's his smiling expression?]

895
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:21,330
[Even though he tries to argue that
his eyes were open... Fail.]

896
00:53:21,330 --> 00:53:23,150
Let's succeed this time.

897
00:53:23,150 --> 00:53:24,950
Come on.

898
00:53:24,950 --> 00:53:27,770
[Telling each other to get the timing right.]

899
00:53:29,900 --> 00:53:31,690
One, two, three.

900
00:53:33,340 --> 00:53:35,770
One, two, three.

901
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:42,240
[Ji Sung's ball goes over the goal post.]

902
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:44,820
- I think we got it.
- I smiled.

903
00:53:47,140 --> 00:53:49,650
[Blank Ji, Evra and Big-nose succeeds
in getting a big smile.]

904
00:53:49,650 --> 00:53:53,090
[What about Frog Kwang?]

905
00:53:53,090 --> 00:53:56,210
[Smile!]

906
00:53:58,750 --> 00:54:00,790
Blue Team... success.

907
00:54:00,790 --> 00:54:03,960
[Team Evra succeeds the
Free kick Photo Zone mission!]

908
00:54:06,010 --> 00:54:09,610
Evra!
Evra!

909
00:54:13,340 --> 00:54:19,050
We have now completed all the player
nomination rounds for the Shanghai Dream Cup.

910
00:54:19,300 --> 00:54:23,770
Park Ji Sung has two votes,
and Evra also has two votes.

911
00:54:23,770 --> 00:54:26,240
[Team Ji Sung and Team Evra each
has two spots open for the game.]

912
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:27,960
Park Ji Sung can nominate two players
from his own team

913
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:31,360
and Evra can nominate two players
from his own team.

914
00:54:32,150 --> 00:54:35,610
Make sure no one sees what you write down
and hand it over to us for us to announce.

915
00:54:35,610 --> 00:54:38,050
[Who will be the members to step their foot
onto the 2013 field of dreams?]

916
00:54:38,060 --> 00:54:40,050
Take it easy and
think about it carefully.

917
00:54:40,840 --> 00:54:44,250
All I want to say is that
experience could be an important factor.

918
00:54:44,250 --> 00:54:47,460
I just want to reiterate that I was
known for my One-Tops...

919
00:54:47,970 --> 00:54:51,400
[After telling him to think comfortably,
everyone is quick to add their two cents.]

920
00:54:55,150 --> 00:54:58,170
[Mr. Kim-Leave it showing off
his sloppy footwork.]

921
00:54:58,170 --> 00:54:59,820
Evra's not watching you right now.

922
00:55:00,590 --> 00:55:02,540
[His love for soccer reaching its peak.]

923
00:55:04,730 --> 00:55:09,720
[Everyone gathering in to add
their final comments and opinions.]

924
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:13,820
You have to choose two players.

925
00:55:13,820 --> 00:55:17,340
Look at me!

926
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:24,120
[Yoo Hyuk's kick hitting Evra
on his back.]

927
00:55:36,060 --> 00:55:37,270
Change, change.

928
00:55:40,330 --> 00:55:41,990
[I'm so sorry.]

929
00:55:45,050 --> 00:55:48,640
[The two captains complete their
recommendations for their two players.]

930
00:55:56,940 --> 00:56:00,740
[Who will the four slots go to?]

931
00:56:00,740 --> 00:56:02,160
We can just cheer them on if
we don't make it in.

932
00:56:02,170 --> 00:56:04,910
- The first player is...
- It's our team?

933
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:07,300
The first player for
Team Park Ji Sung is...

934
00:56:07,820 --> 00:56:09,460
The first player is...

935
00:56:09,460 --> 00:56:14,300
[Nervous... energy.]

936
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:18,120
[Who's the first player that
Captain Park has nominated?]

937
00:56:18,120 --> 00:56:19,760
It's Yoo Jae Suk.

938
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:22,640
[Yoo Jae Suk]

939
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:25,650
- He's so lucky.
- I'll give it my best.

940
00:56:31,410 --> 00:56:33,180
The next player is...

941
00:56:33,190 --> 00:56:35,640
- It's an honor just to be here.
- It's an honor.

942
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:38,530
- Me too.
- I believe the experienced player should.

943
00:56:38,530 --> 00:56:41,010
[Making courteous comments
that they don't really mean.]

944
00:56:41,010 --> 00:56:42,530
Maybe it should go to someone
who's never done it.

945
00:56:42,530 --> 00:56:44,670
But I really hope that it's me.

946
00:56:45,590 --> 00:56:47,470
Second player from Team Ji Sung is...

947
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:49,240
Ha Ha!

948
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:53,340
[Second player- Ha Ha!]

949
00:56:53,340 --> 00:56:56,070
Ji Sung!
I so badly wanted to play!

950
00:56:56,070 --> 00:56:58,810
I wanted to play so badly!
I'm going to make sure to score a goal!

951
00:57:00,370 --> 00:57:04,900
[Gary and Sulli unfortunately
don't make the cut.]

952
00:57:06,030 --> 00:57:08,200
- Since you were in the game last year.
- Of course.

953
00:57:11,610 --> 00:57:14,560
I feel even worse now that
Gary didn't make the cut.

954
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:17,010
[It's Team Evra's turn to make
the announcement of the players.]

955
00:57:17,010 --> 00:57:20,140
Evra made the decision himself.
I didn't choose the players.

956
00:57:20,140 --> 00:57:22,300
[Two players that Evra himself
chose to be in the game.]

957
00:57:22,300 --> 00:57:24,390
I didn't have anything to do
with the decision that he made.

958
00:57:24,390 --> 00:57:26,190
Time to announce the players
for the Blue Team.

959
00:57:26,190 --> 00:57:30,860
[Who will be the first player for Team Evra?]

960
00:57:30,860 --> 00:57:32,300
Lee Kwang Soo.

961
00:57:32,300 --> 00:57:34,380
Yes, Evra!

962
00:57:36,010 --> 00:57:37,650
My brother!

963
00:57:39,260 --> 00:57:41,350
I'm your big fan forever!

964
00:57:42,130 --> 00:57:43,380
- Forever.
- Thank you!

965
00:57:43,380 --> 00:57:46,320
- He told Evra about Jong Kook's neck disk.
- Jong Kook's neck disk?

966
00:57:46,320 --> 00:57:48,550
[Evra made aware of Jong Kook's
slipped disk on his neck?]

967
00:57:48,550 --> 00:57:50,550
- You have medication patches on your neck.
- It's okay.

968
00:57:50,550 --> 00:57:52,290
See?
I'm fine.

969
00:57:53,660 --> 00:57:55,030
No, I'm fine.

970
00:57:55,030 --> 00:57:59,180
<i>Okay, the last player to participate
in the 2013 Dream Cup is...</i>

971

[The final player for
the 2013 Asian Dream Cup is...]

972

[Emotional...]

975
00:58:15,890 --> 00:58:17,290
Thank you, brother.

976
00:58:17,480 --> 00:58:19,590
<i>The four of you who will be
playing in the game</i>

977
00:58:19,590 --> 00:58:27,200

prepare yourselves for the game.</i>

[2013 Asian Dream Cup participants-
Jae Suk, Ha Ha, Kwang Soo, Jong Kook.]

979

We'll be cheering you on.
Good luck.

980
00:58:34,040 --> 00:58:36,300
- Fighting.
- We'll see you later.

981
00:58:36,300 --> 00:58:39,270
- See you later!
- We're proud of you!

- Make sure you win!
- Fighting!

983
00:58:42,290 --> 00:58:44,350
[I should be in that game...]

984
00:58:44,350 --> 00:58:47,830
[Off to the field of dreams!]

seen on TV are all in one place...]

[Camera flashes going off
to capture that moment.]

Captain Park.

993
00:59:35,660 --> 00:59:38,060
Can you tell us what
the strategy for the game is?

994
00:59:41,290 --> 00:59:43,150
4-3-3, or 4-3-2?

995
00:59:43,160 --> 00:59:45,030
The formation is going to be 4-2-3-1.

996
00:59:47,120 --> 00:59:49,340
Jae Suk, it's going to be 4-2-3-1.

997
00:59:49,350 --> 00:59:50,910
[Earning a crucial piece of evidence.]

998
00:59:50,910 --> 00:59:52,310
What did you say?

999
00:59:52,310 --> 00:59:53,810
- 4-2-4?
- 4-2-3-1.

1000
00:59:56,370 --> 00:59:58,230
I usually get a lot of One-Tops.

1001
00:59:59,120 --> 01:00:01,590
[Craving attention
even during a soccer match.]

1002
01:00:03,970 --> 01:00:05,620
What's that on your thighs?
Are those medicated patches?

1003
01:00:06,740 --> 01:00:08,790
You're supposed to do this.

1004
01:00:08,790 --> 01:00:10,080
[Kim Bo Kyung]

1005
01:00:12,250 --> 01:00:14,780
He looks a lot like Kim Bo Kyung.

1006
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:21,690
[Taking a picture with his twin,
Kim Bo Kyung.]

1007
01:00:21,700 --> 01:00:23,980
[Goldfish bread]

1008
01:00:24,660 --> 01:00:26,390
They really do look alike.

1009
01:00:27,810 --> 01:00:31,100

at their own likeness.]

1010

01:00:32,820 --> 01:00:34,970
[Kim Dong Won and Giraffe, Kwang Soo.]

1012
01:00:36,340 --> 01:00:38,450
[A brief time to practice.]

01:00:59,470 --> 01:01:02,350
[Park Ji Sung.
All following him around?]

1018
01:01:06,010 --> 01:01:09,860
[All trailing behind Captain Park.]

1019
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:12,930
[Do whatever Captain Park is doing.]

1020
01:01:15,300 --> 01:01:18,450
[Wanting to be just like Captain Park.]

1021
01:01:23,450 --> 01:01:26,700
[Evra catching sight of the scene.]

1022
01:01:26,700 --> 01:01:28,720
[Initiates Jae Suk in a playful play.]

1023
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:36,380
[End of practice.]

1024
01:01:37,210 --> 01:01:38,910
One more minute.

1025
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:43,260
[At last...]

1026
01:01:46,870 --> 01:01:50,660
[The moment to take their step
onto the field of dreams.]

1027

[Running Man members full of
nervous energy.]

1028
01:01:59,230 --> 01:02:00,470
Kim Jong Kook.

1029
01:02:00,470 --> 01:02:03,310
[Jong Kook is called in!]

1030
01:02:03,710 --> 01:02:07,020
[How can this be?
Kim Jong Kook in the starting lineup!]

1031
01:02:09,540 --> 01:02:11,030
Good luck out there.

1032
01:02:12,530 --> 01:02:15,630
[Kkuk blinking his eyes out of
amazement and nervousness.]

1033

01:02:17,490 --> 01:02:19,300
Good luck!

01:02:21,640 --> 01:02:24,130
[Making their entrance at last...]

1036
01:02:32,430 --> 01:02:37,830
[The unfortunate mistakes
from last year...]

1037
01:02:38,970 --> 01:02:42,360
[Will show off his true skills this year!]

1038
01:02:43,800 --> 01:02:46,490
[Entering the stadium.]

1039

can be heard throughout the stadium!]

1040

[Ceremonial picture of the
starting lineup.]

1041
01:03:11,310 --> 01:03:13,190
[Let's do this.]

1042
01:03:15,570 --> 01:03:17,680
This is unbelievable!

1043
01:03:19,050 --> 01:03:21,780
[The remaining members heading
towards the bench.]

1044
01:03:29,340 --> 01:03:32,340
[But where are the rest of our members?]

1045
01:03:33,490 --> 01:03:36,650
[Everyone with their eyes fixed on
the image of Jong Kook out on the field.]

1046
01:03:36,650 --> 01:03:38,320
[They're right in there.]

1047
01:03:39,420 --> 01:03:41,960
I should be standing out there.

1048
01:03:43,080 --> 01:03:46,890
Jong Kook doesn't look as nervous
as he did last year out on that field.

1049
01:03:48,770 --> 01:03:51,060
- Here's the news article in Korea.
- What does it say?

1050
01:03:51,060 --> 01:03:53,490
That Kim Jong Kook and
Ji Dong Won are Two-Tops.

1051
01:03:55,070 --> 01:03:59,620
[There really is a news article...]

1052
01:03:59,620 --> 01:04:01,660
Is media play even allowed?

1053
01:04:01,660 --> 01:04:07,240
That'll be Kim Jong Kook's first and last
sports news article.

1054
01:04:08,340 --> 01:04:12,500
[Today's game being
broadcasted live in Korea.]

1055
01:04:13,930 --> 01:04:15,180
[Jong Kook's name on the lineup list!]

1056
01:04:17,450 --> 01:04:21,060
<i>Everyone has their eyes on Kim Jong Kook.
He has to be the ace player of the day.</i>

1057
01:04:21,060 --> 01:04:23,430
<i>If Kim Jong Kook doesn't pull his weight,
it'll be tough for his team to score a goal.</i>

1058
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:25,340
<i>That's correct.
Wow... he has an impressive build.</i>

1059
01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:34,500
[The first half finally starts!]

1060
01:04:42,250 --> 01:04:47,930

around kicking the ball on this field!]

1061

[And Tiger Jong Kook running with
confidence amongst them!]

1062
01:04:50,280 --> 01:04:52,450
Jong Kook's build
looks like any other players.

1063
01:04:53,550 --> 01:04:55,690
[Blank Ji seeming to be
more nervous than he is.]

1064
01:04:55,690 --> 01:04:57,770
He and Ji Dong Won are the Two-Tops.

1065
01:04:59,010 --> 01:05:01,760
[Fellow members with their eyes following
Jong Kook's every move.]

1066
01:05:10,370 --> 01:05:13,260
[Captain Park's impressive footwork!]

1067
01:05:14,440 --> 01:05:15,990
There it is!

1068
01:05:15,990 --> 01:05:18,010
[A chance for Jong Kook!]

1069
01:05:22,500 --> 01:05:25,110
[Jong Kook moving into where
the ball was passed!]

1070
01:05:29,500 --> 01:05:32,870
[If he can receive the pass...]

1071
01:05:32,870 --> 01:05:36,400
[But the ball unfortunately
goes out of bounds.]

1072
01:05:36,910 --> 01:05:39,840
[But Kkuk shows that
he can make the right moves!]

1073
01:05:46,020 --> 01:05:48,340
[A 2:1 pass!]

1074
01:05:48,340 --> 01:05:51,440
[Kkuk showing his great passing skills
alongside Lee Chung Yong!]

1075
01:05:53,300 --> 01:05:55,090
- Jong Kook made a nice pass.
- Yeah.

1076
01:05:55,910 --> 01:05:58,890
[Number 38, Kim Jong Kook...
showing a different side to him this year?]

1077
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:04,420
Look at the expression on
Jae Suk's face.

1078
01:06:05,410 --> 01:06:07,970
[Frightened Jae Suk.]

1079
01:06:07,970 --> 01:06:10,690
[His heart is about to beat
out of his chest.]

1080
01:06:14,650 --> 01:06:17,090
It's so nerve wrecking to
be sitting here.

1081
01:06:17,220 --> 01:06:20,640
[Getting more and more nervous seeing
the big crowd and all the players.]

1082
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:22,490
I wonder how nervous Jong Kook is.

1083
01:06:24,930 --> 01:06:26,690
What do I do if they pass
the ball to me like that?

1084
01:06:28,810 --> 01:06:31,530
[Having less and less to say
from their nervous energy.]

1085
01:06:36,710 --> 01:06:41,250
[Shocking... To know that
he could actually be silent.]

1086
01:06:43,470 --> 01:06:45,850
[Only 15 minutes having passed
in the first half.]

1087
01:06:47,260 --> 01:06:49,210
[Evra's light footwork.]

1088
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:53,240
[Just then, a pass is made over to Kkuk!]

1089
01:06:53,240 --> 01:06:54,590
It's Jong Kook!

1090
01:06:55,170 --> 01:06:58,180
[A slew of defense raining down
on him to his one side!]

1091
01:06:59,490 --> 01:07:02,020
[Will he be able to break through?]

1092
01:07:05,240 --> 01:07:08,720
[Missing his aim!]

1093
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:10,840
[Oh no!]

1094
01:07:11,480 --> 01:07:14,120
[His sloppy footwork missing its mark!]

1095
01:07:21,430 --> 01:07:23,240
He missed his aim.

1096
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:26,740
[Evra encouraging him on.]

1097
01:07:29,320 --> 01:07:31,090
[You'll have the ball stolen from you
if you try to do it all by yourself.]

1098
01:07:35,370 --> 01:07:37,680
[Captain Park's accurate long pass.]

1099
01:07:38,190 --> 01:07:39,690
Evra!

1100
01:07:44,100 --> 01:07:45,370
Evra shoots!

1101
01:07:45,370 --> 01:07:47,510
[Just then!]

1102
01:07:47,510 --> 01:07:50,140
[A chance for Kkuk to shoot!]

1103
01:07:50,140 --> 01:07:52,320
[Ah...]

1104
01:07:53,070 --> 01:07:56,450
[Kkuk having wasted a golden opportunity.]

1105
01:07:56,450 --> 01:07:58,620
- Oh no!
- He missed the pass!

1106
01:07:58,630 --> 01:08:01,560
He really isn't good, is he?
He just likes the sport.

1107
01:08:01,560 --> 01:08:05,770
He just likes the sport.
He's just chasing the ball around.

1108
01:08:06,770 --> 01:08:10,950
[Chasing after the ball like its shadow.
Soccer lover, Mr. Kim-Leave it.]

1109
01:08:10,950 --> 01:08:12,760
If Jong Kook is playing that bad,
what hope is there for us?

1110
01:08:13,530 --> 01:08:15,600
[Full of worries.]

1111
01:08:17,450 --> 01:08:19,040
You're going in at the 25 minute mark.

1112
01:08:19,040 --> 01:08:20,850
- Who? Me?
- I think he meant you.

1113

[Giraffe Kwang Soo being told
to warm up.]

1114

- Is that Lee Kwang Soo?
- There he is. He's coming out.

1122
01:09:08,300 --> 01:09:11,270
- Way to go.
- Kwang Soo!

1123

I'm getting nervous for him!

1124
01:09:15,790 --> 01:09:18,540
- Why am I getting so nervous?
- I'm getting nervous for him!

1125

[Giant Giraffe goes in!]

1129
01:09:43,640 --> 01:09:47,210
Now everyone will get a chance to see soccer
being transformed into a variety game show.

1130
01:09:49,300 --> 01:09:50,970
What if Kwang Soo makes a goal
with a headshot?

1131
01:09:50,970 --> 01:09:55,420
Lee Kwang Soo!
Look at how tall he looks out there.

1132
01:09:55,430 --> 01:09:59,050
[With his impressive height,
a headshot is definitely possible.]

1133
01:09:59,050 --> 01:10:01,210
Kwang Soo needs to spike in a goal.

1134

[Captain Park ordering
Kwang Soo on where to go.]

1135
01:10:03,570 --> 01:10:06,570
[A corner kick chance!
Off by the goal post!]

1136
01:10:12,760 --> 01:10:15,630
[Even showing off some rough
playing skills.]

1137
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:19,040
I think Kwang Soo's going to be good.
He gets rough out there.

1138
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:22,190
[Amazed by Kwang Soo's aggressive moves.]

1139
01:10:22,690 --> 01:10:25,640
[Similar vibe as
England's Peter Crouch.]

1140
01:10:25,640 --> 01:10:27,410
Made a heading goal, Kwang Soo.

1141
01:10:32,840 --> 01:10:34,990
[A chance for a headshot?]

1142
01:10:35,800 --> 01:10:38,640
[Giraffe Crouch missing his timing.]

1143

[But tall Giraffe still giving off the vibe
as if he may pull something off.]

1144
01:10:45,280 --> 01:10:49,680
- He's playing aggressively out there.
- With his tall height, the Chinese players...

1145
01:10:51,410 --> 01:10:54,290
[Gritting his teeth and sticking to
his spot by the goal post.]

1146
01:10:58,040 --> 01:11:02,090
[A pass made in the Giraffe's direction!]

1147
01:11:03,930 --> 01:11:05,580

[Jump]

1149
01:11:17,810 --> 01:11:20,790
[Will he pull it off?]

1150
01:11:23,990 --> 01:11:25,940
[Ah... where's the ball?]

1151
01:11:31,290 --> 01:11:34,580
[Landing his headshot on the ground.]

1152
01:11:34,590 --> 01:11:36,260
[Oh no!]

1153
01:11:36,270 --> 01:11:38,310
[But you still did good!]

1154
01:11:40,710 --> 01:11:43,520
- He crashed.
- Even in sports, that's how he ends up.

1155
01:11:44,680 --> 01:11:47,530
[But still aggressively making his
attempt at making the headshot.]

1156
01:11:47,530 --> 01:11:49,660
Maybe he's trying too hard?

1157
01:11:50,510 --> 01:11:52,450
Is Kwang Soo okay?

1158
01:11:52,460 --> 01:11:54,330
- I bet that really hurt.
- That had to have hurt.

1159
01:11:55,170 --> 01:11:57,550
<i>Evra steadies the ball and passes it.
Lee Kwang Soo!</i>

1160
01:11:58,780 --> 01:12:02,250
<i>He had the chance, but didn't
jump very high given his height.</i>

1161
01:12:02,250 --> 01:12:05,260
[He didn't jump very high
given his height.]

1162
01:12:12,450 --> 01:12:15,180
[His long legs spiraling out of control
out on the field.]

1163
01:12:16,310 --> 01:12:19,510
[Bringing tons of laughter
to the crowd.]

1164
01:12:24,130 --> 01:12:25,310
Kwang Soo!

1165
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:32,270
[Heading it with the side of his head?]

1166
01:12:32,850 --> 01:12:36,160
[Giraffe Crouch not performing
as well as expected.]

1167
01:12:36,160 --> 01:12:38,140
[What are you doing?]

1168
01:12:40,040 --> 01:12:42,020
He almost took that shot face first.

1169
01:12:42,020 --> 01:12:43,800
But he's still doing great.

1170
01:12:53,800 --> 01:12:57,700
[Giving the chance at a
free kick to Kwang Soo?]

1171
01:12:57,700 --> 01:12:59,270
Is Kwang Soo going to kick it?

1172
01:12:59,270 --> 01:13:01,340
I think Kwang Soo is kicking it.

1173
01:13:01,340 --> 01:13:03,340
Oh my gosh, Kwang Soo's kicking!

1174
01:13:03,340 --> 01:13:06,370
Don't do it!
Don't do this to our Kwang Soo!

1175
01:13:06,370 --> 01:13:08,280
- Please!
- Kwang Soo!

1176
01:13:09,040 --> 01:13:10,750
- Please!
- Kwang Soo!

1177
01:13:10,750 --> 01:13:13,360
[Free kicker- Number 42,
Lee Kwang Soo.]

1178
01:13:14,410 --> 01:13:18,270
[20m to the goal... Can he make it?]

1179
01:13:24,680 --> 01:13:28,340
[Runs up to the ball
without any hesitation!]

1180
01:13:29,020 --> 01:13:32,550
[Will he make it?]

1181
01:13:37,740 --> 01:13:41,350
[Shooting the ball straight to
the goalie without any power behind it.]

1182
01:13:48,130 --> 01:13:50,900
[Chastised by Captain Park.]

1183
01:13:57,700 --> 01:13:59,890
But that was still a very effective kick.

1184
01:14:01,490 --> 01:14:03,720
- Does that count as a shot?
- Yes, it does.

1185
01:14:05,470 --> 01:14:07,270
[In one of the Chinese newspapers
on that same day...]

1186
01:14:07,270 --> 01:14:10,790
[This is the shot that made the papers.]

1187
01:14:13,620 --> 01:14:15,770
Kwang Soo, make a headshot.

1188
01:14:16,200 --> 01:14:18,870
[Giraffe Crouch still running
with everything that he has.]

1189
01:14:18,870 --> 01:14:21,260
[Another headshot?]

1190
01:14:27,690 --> 01:14:30,480
[Ji Sung's headshot bounces off
the post and misses the goal!]

1191
01:14:31,620 --> 01:14:34,220
- I should be out there!
- I should be out there!

1192
01:14:34,980 --> 01:14:37,400
I would've kicked it better than that!

1193
01:14:37,400 --> 01:14:39,720
All he had to do was kick it in.

1194
01:14:40,650 --> 01:14:43,060
[Giant Giraffe traded out of the game.]

1195
01:14:43,060 --> 01:14:47,490
- Great job, Kwang Soo.
- At least you didn't humiliate yourself.

1196
01:14:49,310 --> 01:14:50,980
- Good job.
- Good job, Kwang Soo.

1197
01:14:50,980 --> 01:14:54,080
- Good job.
- How was it out there?

1198
01:14:56,850 --> 01:14:58,160
Is it that bad?

1199
01:14:59,040 --> 01:15:00,960
Ji Sung nags at you so much.

1200
01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:03,820
- Like what?
- 'What are you doing!'

1201
01:15:05,430 --> 01:15:08,640
You even made some headshots,
and got to do a free kick too.

1202
01:15:08,640 --> 01:15:12,340
You are the only person on Running Man
who got to do something like that.

1203
01:15:12,350 --> 01:15:14,470
There appeared to be three balls
while I was out on that field.

1204
01:15:14,470 --> 01:15:16,300
I thought I was going to lose it.

1205
01:15:16,300 --> 01:15:20,300
I chose one of those three balls in my vision,
but that wasn't the real ball.

1206
01:15:20,300 --> 01:15:21,950
[Chose one of the three balls in his vision,
but that wasn't the real ball.]

1207
01:15:26,720 --> 01:15:29,370
[Start of second half!]

1208
01:15:30,840 --> 01:15:32,840
- Is Minho in there?
- Huh?

1209
01:15:32,840 --> 01:15:36,020
[Captain Park sitting on the bench?]

1210
01:15:36,020 --> 01:15:38,660
Evra said he wants to run
for another 15 minutes.

1211
01:15:39,970 --> 01:15:43,320
[Frighteningly tired Evra...
What a marvel!]

1212
01:15:43,320 --> 01:15:44,720
Nice!

1213
01:15:46,070 --> 01:15:48,660
[Evra with the ball!]

1214
01:15:48,660 --> 01:15:50,680
Nice.
Shoot!

1215
01:15:53,020 --> 01:15:55,810
[Ah... the goal post!]

1216
01:15:56,550 --> 01:15:59,270
[So close!]

1217
01:16:02,710 --> 01:16:04,730
[The score is still at 0:0.]

1218
01:16:06,430 --> 01:16:08,160
You need to warm up.

1219
01:16:09,330 --> 01:16:11,170
I said, you need to warm up.

1220
01:16:11,930 --> 01:16:14,650
[The time has come...]

1221
01:16:18,060 --> 01:16:20,840
[Ro-Ro finally heading in to warm up!]

1222
01:16:20,850 --> 01:16:23,480
- There's Ha Dong Hoon!
- Where?

1223
01:16:28,680 --> 01:16:30,320
There he is!

1224
01:16:31,430 --> 01:16:33,300
I'm nervous for you!

1225
01:16:35,590 --> 01:16:37,810
I really should be out there.

1226
01:16:39,370 --> 01:16:42,270
[So nervous...]

1227
01:16:43,680 --> 01:16:46,180
[Huh? What's that underneath?]

1228
01:16:50,960 --> 01:16:53,920
Both my shirts came off.
They both came off.

1229
01:16:53,920 --> 01:16:55,840
[Showing off his Iron Man shirt
to everyone.]

1230
01:17:07,820 --> 01:17:09,980
[Jae Suk also heading
into the warm up area.]

1231
01:17:18,170 --> 01:17:19,540
There's Jae Suk!

1232
01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:23,800
- Jae Suk!
- Ha Ha!

1233
01:17:23,800 --> 01:17:26,750
- Ha Ha!
- Ha Dong Hoon!

1234
01:17:27,520 --> 01:17:29,280
[So nervous!]

1235
01:17:33,180 --> 01:17:35,180
[Just then!]

1236
01:17:38,940 --> 01:17:41,380
[Goal!]

1237
01:17:43,270 --> 01:17:46,240
[Captain Park scores a goal!]

1238
01:17:58,470 --> 01:18:01,510
[That's our Captain Park!]

1239
01:18:05,610 --> 01:18:07,580
He truly is the Captain of Asia!

1240
01:18:11,360 --> 01:18:15,290
[Ha Ha trades Minho out!]

1241
01:18:16,620 --> 01:18:19,500
[Ro-Ro finally stepping out onto the field!]

1242
01:18:21,070 --> 01:18:22,820
Is he ready?

1243
01:18:23,690 --> 01:18:25,850
[Ro-Ro being stationed off to the side.]

1244
01:18:27,410 --> 01:18:29,830
[With Ji Sung's goal,
the score is now at 1-0.]

1245
01:18:38,080 --> 01:18:41,520
[Haroro running all over the field
with his short little legs.]

1246
01:18:49,310 --> 01:18:52,440
[Winger Haroro showing off his sloppy
foot skills no matter where he goes.]

1247
01:18:54,380 --> 01:18:55,940
Oh no!

1248
01:18:57,350 --> 01:18:59,200
I can't bear to watch this.

1249
01:18:59,650 --> 01:19:03,320
<i>Ha Ha stands out on the field with
his blond hair and short legs.</i>

1250
01:19:03,320 --> 01:19:06,100
<i>But he manages to move
fairly quickly, doesn't he?</i>

1251
01:19:06,100 --> 01:19:08,860
<i>- Yes.
- He slightly resembles Lee Geun Ho.</i>

1252
01:19:09,890 --> 01:19:11,550
<i>- No, I was wrong
- Yes.</i>

1253
01:19:13,410 --> 01:19:16,610
[Jae Suk heading off to
take his position.]

1254
01:19:20,540 --> 01:19:22,430
I'm not good at soccer.

1255
01:19:23,270 --> 01:19:25,140
- How do you feel?
- What?

1256
01:19:25,140 --> 01:19:27,660
What are you doing?
Are you shooting this?

1257
01:19:27,660 --> 01:19:29,980
Do I look like I can even think
of what to say right now?

1258
01:19:30,560 --> 01:19:31,740
- I'm going to go crazy.
- You have to score a goal.

1259
01:19:31,740 --> 01:19:34,270
You're telling me to score a goal when
even this professionals can't score one?

1260
01:19:36,320 --> 01:19:38,430
[So easily startled...]

1261
01:19:38,430 --> 01:19:41,050
You're going to trade out
with Nam Tae Hee.]

1262
01:19:41,050 --> 01:19:44,760
He's in the center right now, so you'll
be a Two-Top with Suk Hyun Joon.

1263
01:19:46,330 --> 01:19:48,640
[Two-Top?]

1264
01:19:49,520 --> 01:19:51,060
- I'm playing the Two-Top position?
- Yes.

1265
01:19:51,790 --> 01:19:56,220
[Neighborhood One-Top position...
and now a real Two-Top position.]

1266
01:19:57,380 --> 01:19:59,430
- You have to make the goals.
- I'll do my best, but...

1267
01:19:59,430 --> 01:20:01,490
But I've never done that before.

1268
01:20:04,440 --> 01:20:07,140
[Ro-Ro doing well in his position
in the sideline.]

1269
01:20:11,470 --> 01:20:12,800
[Passing off to the open player.]

1270
01:20:15,800 --> 01:20:16,910
Shoot!

1271
01:20:16,910 --> 01:20:19,980
[Blocks off the goal.]

1272
01:20:20,530 --> 01:20:23,580
[But it was still an amazing attack which
started with Ro-Ro's move.]

1273
01:20:28,060 --> 01:20:31,060
I was told I have to take off my glasses.
I'm not going to be able to see the ball.

1274
01:20:32,630 --> 01:20:35,430
[Jae Suk finally getting ready
to step out onto the field.]

1275
01:20:35,430 --> 01:20:38,080
- Please!
- I'm so nervous for Jae Suk.

1276
01:20:38,080 --> 01:20:40,420
- Come on, Jae Suk.
- He took off his glasses.

1277
01:20:41,010 --> 01:20:43,260
Can he see?
What if he can't see?

1278
01:20:43,260 --> 01:20:45,580
The bigger problem is that he looks
so ugly without his glasses on.

1279
01:20:45,580 --> 01:20:48,030
[More worried about how his
bare face looks rather than his vision?]

1280
01:20:55,650 --> 01:20:58,510
[A chance at a penalty kick!]

1281
01:21:01,590 --> 01:21:03,630
He came out of nowhere!

1282
01:21:04,840 --> 01:21:06,910
[Sulli getting upset for him.]

1283
01:21:09,080 --> 01:21:11,820
[What?
Giving Haroro the chance to kick?]

1284
01:21:17,010 --> 01:21:19,100
- Ha Ha!
- Ha Ha!

1285
01:21:19,110 --> 01:21:20,950
[How is he...]

1286
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:22,830
Ha Ha's getting the chance
at the penalty kick!

1287
01:21:22,830 --> 01:21:25,140
Don't give him the ball!

1288
01:21:25,980 --> 01:21:28,150
[It really does look as though he's
going to make the penalty kick.]

1289
01:21:28,910 --> 01:21:31,960
- Stop tormenting our Ha Ha!
- Stop tormenting our Ha Ha!

1290
01:21:32,510 --> 01:21:34,370
Don't torment him!

1291
01:21:38,130 --> 01:21:41,420
[Just then, Jae Suk trades
Nam Tae Hee out!]

1292
01:21:51,970 --> 01:21:53,620
[It's Jae Suk.]

1293
01:21:55,300 --> 01:21:57,190
[What? Telling Jae Suk to kick the
penalty kick as soon as he comes in?]

1294
01:21:57,200 --> 01:21:58,740
I can't see anything!

1295
01:22:02,430 --> 01:22:05,650
[Even though he begged and told them that
he can't see without his glasses...]

1296
01:22:07,220 --> 01:22:10,400
Jae Suk is about to kick off the penalty kick!
Let's cheer him on!

1297
01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:11,420
[How can this be?]

1298
01:22:14,010 --> 01:22:15,880
As soon as he goes in the game...

1299
01:22:22,010 --> 01:22:23,430
Jae Suk...

1300
01:22:24,790 --> 01:22:26,170
You have to score the goal!

1301
01:22:27,740 --> 01:22:30,160
[Readying himself to kick the penalty kick
as soon as he comes into the game.]

1302
01:22:30,160 --> 01:22:31,670
A penalty kick as soon as
he's in the game!

1303
01:22:31,680 --> 01:22:34,270
[How will Yoo-ames Bond fare?]

1304
01:22:34,670 --> 01:22:36,730
[Torrential rain picks just that moment
to start pouring.]

1305
01:22:36,730 --> 01:22:41,700
[Especially not being able to see
without his glasses...]

1306
01:22:41,700 --> 01:22:44,970
[Will he be able to make the penalty kick?]

1307
01:22:50,550 --> 01:22:54,070
[Please...]

1308
01:22:57,880 --> 01:23:01,320
[Mightily kicking the ball!]

1309
01:23:18,290 --> 01:23:22,650
[A good kick...]

1310
01:23:25,540 --> 01:23:27,390
[Hits the goal post!]

1311
01:23:30,420 --> 01:23:32,070
It hit the goal post!

1312
01:23:32,070 --> 01:23:34,440
- What the heck!
- That was still great!

1313
01:23:34,440 --> 01:23:36,530
[A strong reaction even from
the players.]

1314
01:23:39,240 --> 01:23:40,880
But that was still a great kick.

1315
01:23:46,350 --> 01:23:49,170
<i>Yoo Jae Suk getting ready to
kick off the penalty kick!</i>

1316
01:23:55,120 --> 01:23:57,570
<i>- It hit the goal post and bounced off.
- Yes, it's too bad.</i>

1317
01:23:57,580 --> 01:24:03,220
<i>- That was looking pretty good though.
- It was a nice kick. It's too bad.</i>

1318
01:24:05,060 --> 01:24:07,340
[Such a close call!]

1319
01:24:09,960 --> 01:24:12,560
- This is so cool.
- Watching them playing in the rain is cool.

1320
01:24:12,560 --> 01:24:13,900
I'm getting goosebumps.

1321
01:24:16,280 --> 01:24:19,320
