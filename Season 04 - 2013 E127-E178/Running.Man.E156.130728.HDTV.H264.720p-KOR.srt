[Somewhere from a faraway galaxy]

00:00:06,346 --> 00:00:07,757
<i>One mistake, and it could all be over.</i>

3
00:00:07,758 --> 00:00:11,744
<i>- It has antennas on its head.
- It came to find what it needs.</i>

4
00:00:11,745 --> 00:00:14,697
[Their goal is to find 21 liters of
water of life.]

5
00:00:14,698 --> 00:00:18,106
[Complete the mission and
return to planet 21.]

6
00:00:18,107 --> 00:00:20,899
[Trade the overflowing energy of aliens
from planet 21 for water of life.]

[Will they be able to get their hands on
21 liters of water of life?]

00:00:30,808 --> 00:00:33,228
[One rainy morning...]

10
00:00:33,229 --> 00:00:35,552
[Han River Park in Seoyoondo.]

11
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:40,568
[Even though the day is cloudy and overcast,
the members are in cheerful moods.]

12
00:00:40,569 --> 00:00:43,304
- It's another cloudy day today.
- Yes.

13
00:00:43,305 --> 00:00:45,241
Even though the day may be cloudy,
we're still dressed very bright.

14
00:00:45,242 --> 00:00:47,471
What do you mean, bright?
You look like a snake dressed like that.

15
00:00:47,838 --> 00:00:49,736
[Brightly dressed, silky, muscular snake.]

16
00:00:49,737 --> 00:00:53,505
- This is the latest style.
- That's what bicyclists wear.

17
00:00:53,506 --> 00:00:56,405
If you want to talk about pants,
take a look at Ji Hyo's pants.

18
00:00:57,705 --> 00:01:00,346
- Ji Hyo's pants...
- Did you sew your pants together?

19
00:01:00,347 --> 00:01:02,283
[Ji Hyo's high fashion pants
in need of an explanation.]

20
00:01:02,284 --> 00:01:05,975
- I was told to wear these.
- Did your mother sew them up for you?

21
00:01:07,552 --> 00:01:08,752
What are we doing today?

22
00:01:08,753 --> 00:01:11,276
- I was told to wear something futuristic.
- Why did you ask us to dress like this today?

23
00:01:11,277 --> 00:01:13,487
- Even though you may not remember...
- Yes?

24
00:01:13,488 --> 00:01:16,161
<i>All of you... are space aliens.</i>

25
00:01:16,162 --> 00:01:18,720
[Space aliens?]

26
00:01:18,721 --> 00:01:19,999
There he goes again.

27
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,391
I remember!

28
00:01:21,392 --> 00:01:23,218
[Moment of awakening?]

29
00:01:23,219 --> 00:01:25,409
Just how far are you going
to take this?

30
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:29,049
<i>Even though you may not really remember
since you've been on earth for so long...</i>

31
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:30,357
I don't remember a thing.

32
00:01:30,358 --> 00:01:34,849
<i>Even though you may look like earthlings,
all of you are space aliens.</i>

33
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:38,388
<i>I sincerely welcome all of you
here on earth.</i>

34
00:01:38,866 --> 00:01:42,584
<i>I received word that some other aliens
have just arrived on earth.</i>

35
00:01:42,585 --> 00:01:45,021
- Please ask them to come out.
- Really?

36
00:01:45,591 --> 00:01:49,610
- We'll welcome new aliens out here.
- Please come on out!

37
00:01:49,611 --> 00:01:50,754
Come on out!

38
00:01:54,231 --> 00:01:59,101
[Spaceship doors start to open...]

39
00:01:59,102 --> 00:02:02,535
[Who are the other space aliens
that have made their way to earth?]

40
00:02:06,658 --> 00:02:08,501
[Wait, these are...]

41
00:02:08,502 --> 00:02:10,629
[The ladies are here!]

42
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:14,281
[Four dimensional alien idols, 2NE1!]

43
00:02:16,585 --> 00:02:20,048
[Welcome to earth!]

44
00:02:22,274 --> 00:02:25,323
[Entering while dancing
their alien-like dance.]

45
00:02:26,716 --> 00:02:29,794
That's the way we should've
dressed today.

46
00:02:30,966 --> 00:02:32,406
[Hi, earth.]

47
00:02:34,369 --> 00:02:37,014
[A glaring entrance.]

48
00:02:38,526 --> 00:02:42,905
[Even though they may be from outer space,
their manners are still impeccable.]

49
00:02:44,069 --> 00:02:46,048
[Please don't do that.]

50
00:02:49,106 --> 00:02:51,737
Please say a word of greeting
to our viewers.

51
00:02:51,738 --> 00:02:54,422
- Hello.
- What's up! We 2NE1!

52
00:02:56,568 --> 00:03:00,274
I can now understand why we were asked
to wear flashy futuristic clothing.

53
00:03:00,275 --> 00:03:02,497
But it's not easy to get outfits like
the ones they're wearing.

54
00:03:03,112 --> 00:03:05,532
This is the way to dress if
you're to dress in futuristic fashion.

55
00:03:05,567 --> 00:03:07,646
The outfit that you're wearing
is the most conservative.

56
00:03:07,647 --> 00:03:09,765
- The way Min Ji is dressed...
- She and I are dressed very similarly.

57
00:03:09,766 --> 00:03:11,816
[Same clothing look,
but different feel to it.]

58
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:15,278
But, Sandara Park is...

59
00:03:15,279 --> 00:03:17,721
[Huh? Who's Sandara Park?]

60
00:03:18,771 --> 00:03:21,505
We have a long established relationship
with Sandra.

61
00:03:21,506 --> 00:03:24,640
But you don't wear your hair
like that much these days, do you?

62
00:03:24,641 --> 00:03:27,872
I usually have my hair up like this when
I'm just lounging around at home.

63
00:03:27,873 --> 00:03:31,433
I know that these ladies don't usually
come out on variety programs.

64
00:03:31,434 --> 00:03:33,102
- Isn't this your first time?
- I think this is their first time, isn't it?

65
00:03:33,103 --> 00:03:34,660
- Yes, it is.
- It is, isn't it?

66
00:03:34,661 --> 00:03:37,115
- We were determined to come on this show.
- Really?

67
00:03:37,928 --> 00:03:41,067
[2NE1's declaration of being determined
to make their appearance on this program.]

68
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:44,496
[Their unstoppable spirit!]

69
00:03:44,497 --> 00:03:46,374
[Overflowing amount of energy!]

70
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:49,906
[Their sense of humor that they've
kept hidden comes out in full force!]

71
00:03:49,907 --> 00:03:51,162
[They're on fire!]

72
00:03:51,163 --> 00:03:53,198
What's that guy's name again?

73
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:56,795
[Michael?
It's me, actor Lee Kwang Soo.]

74
00:03:56,796 --> 00:03:59,254
- Is it Michael?
- He's younger than us.

75
00:03:59,255 --> 00:04:01,806
- Really?
- Yes, it's true.

76
00:04:01,807 --> 00:04:05,529
- Kwang Soo's younger than you?
- Yes, these two are older than him.

77
00:04:06,307 --> 00:04:09,708
[This face is younger than Sandara Park
and Park Bom?]

78
00:04:10,899 --> 00:04:13,485
- How old are you?
- How old are Bom and Sandara?

79
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:15,812
- We were born in '84.
- Then you are older than him.

80
00:04:15,813 --> 00:04:17,498
Don't even think about addressing them
as your older sister.

81
00:04:17,533 --> 00:04:19,863
- Don't even think about it.
- I'd like to see you try.

82
00:04:19,863 --> 00:04:22,617
[Never address them as your older sister!]

83
00:04:22,618 --> 00:04:25,476
<i>I'll tell you the reason why all you aliens
have made your way to planet earth.</i>

84
00:04:25,477 --> 00:04:27,173
- Why? Why did we come here?
- What is our mission here?

85
00:04:27,174 --> 00:04:34,055
<i>You all came to earth in search of water from
a planet that is in desperate need of water.</i>

86
00:04:35,706 --> 00:04:38,540
<i>The amount of water that you all need</i>

87
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:43,100
<i>to take back to your home planet is
exactly 21 liters.</i>

88
00:04:43,101 --> 00:04:45,538
[The amount of water needed to save their
home planet is exactly 21 liters.]

89
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,024
I see... it's because they're 2NE1.

90
00:04:49,025 --> 00:04:51,642
[The meaning of 21 liters...
quite easy, isn't it?]

91
00:04:51,643 --> 00:04:54,365
<i>Your mission is to obtain that amount
of water by the end of your final mission</i>

92
00:04:54,366 --> 00:04:56,147
<i>and return it back to your home planet.</i>

93
00:04:56,148 --> 00:05:00,366
<i>Whenever you fail to complete your mission,
something unfortunate will happen to you.</i>

94
00:05:00,367 --> 00:05:02,982
<i>So please make sure that you
pass each of your missions.</i>

95
00:05:02,983 --> 00:05:05,453
- I will now announce the teams.
- Sounds good.

96
00:05:05,454 --> 00:05:07,009
- Yoo Jae Suk...
- Yes?

97
00:05:07,293 --> 00:05:09,182
- Lee Kwang Soo.
- Come on!

98
00:05:09,183 --> 00:05:11,059
[First team- Jae Suk and Kwang Soo.]

99
00:05:14,861 --> 00:05:17,451
Park Bom and Minzy will also join your team.

100
00:05:17,451 --> 00:05:18,923
[First Team-
Jae Suk, Kwang Soo, Park Bom, Minzy.]

101
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:23,197
Bom, and Minzy... come over here.

102
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:26,265
So there are going to be
three teams?

103
00:05:26,266 --> 00:05:29,322
Ha Ha and Gary...

104
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:32,354
with Sandara Park and CL.

105
00:05:33,338 --> 00:05:35,672
[Got lucky, didn't you?]

106
00:05:37,174 --> 00:05:40,375
[By default, the third team is
Suk Jin, Jong Kook and Ji Hyo.]

107
00:05:40,896 --> 00:05:44,592
- We've got your manager, coordinator...
- He's our department head.

108
00:05:44,932 --> 00:05:46,798
- Wait a minute!
- What?

109
00:05:46,799 --> 00:05:50,571
[Seems like Department Head Jong Kook
will become butt of Jae Suk's jokes all day.]

110
00:05:50,606 --> 00:05:54,130
<i>An agent that will guide you
is about to make his entrance.</i>

111
00:05:54,131 --> 00:05:55,228
Really?

112
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:56,742
Look, it's Dong Wan.

113
00:05:56,743 --> 00:05:58,620
He's from Men in Black.

114
00:05:58,621 --> 00:06:00,225
[Men in Black's top agent,
Agent Go makes his entrance.]

115
00:06:00,226 --> 00:06:04,134
It's nice to meet you all.
I'm MIB's top agent, Agent Go.

116
00:06:04,135 --> 00:06:05,450
Just go on with it.

117
00:06:05,715 --> 00:06:09,248
It's time for you to receive your tools
that you will be needing.

118
00:06:09,249 --> 00:06:12,586
One member of your team can
choose a bell.

119
00:06:12,995 --> 00:06:16,392
And the rest of the team members will
choose one earthly item.

120
00:06:16,393 --> 00:06:17,719
A bell and an earthly item?

121
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:20,750
First, choose a member of your team
that will be using the bell.

122
00:06:20,751 --> 00:06:24,149
Should I do the bell?
But what is it? What's the bell for?

123
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:25,332
[Jae Suk from Team Jae Suk
to use the bell.]

124
00:06:25,367 --> 00:06:26,796
- We choose Gary.
- You do it, Gary.

125
00:06:26,797 --> 00:06:28,438
[Gary from his team chooses the bell.]

126
00:06:28,439 --> 00:06:30,929
- Jong Kook, you do it.
- The rest of the team members...

127
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:34,110
You will step forward and choose
your earthly item.

128
00:06:34,111 --> 00:06:36,943
[The rest of the team members to choose an
earthly item numbered from one through nine.]

129
00:06:36,944 --> 00:06:38,864
- Number three.
- I'll take number five.

130
00:06:38,865 --> 00:06:40,166
- Number five?
- And I'll take number nine.

131
00:06:40,167 --> 00:06:42,404
The rest of you can take these numbers.

132
00:06:43,001 --> 00:06:47,203
[With the exception of the bell takers,
the remaining members to take the numbers.]

133
00:06:47,204 --> 00:06:49,826
You will now start your mission.

134
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:51,877
But before we do that...

135
00:06:53,342 --> 00:06:55,103
Please give me your attention
for a moment.

136
00:06:55,104 --> 00:06:56,555
Wow, what's that?

137
00:06:57,784 --> 00:06:59,621
That's the thing that makes you
lose your memory.

138
00:06:59,622 --> 00:07:01,376
[The memory eraser from Men in Black?]

139
00:07:01,377 --> 00:07:04,529
- What do you take us for?
- Are you going to embarrass us like this?

140
00:07:04,888 --> 00:07:08,152
[It's not like this is the first time...
Just accept it and let him do it.]

141
00:07:08,153 --> 00:07:09,458
Okay, here I go.
One...

142
00:07:09,459 --> 00:07:11,564
[One member with his sunglasses on.]

143
00:07:11,565 --> 00:07:13,234
Take off your sunglasses, Mister.

144
00:07:13,235 --> 00:07:15,107
Okay, I will.

145
00:07:17,516 --> 00:07:18,700
Hurry up and do it.

146
00:07:18,701 --> 00:07:21,417
He thinks that he's a big time celebrity
ever since we got back from Hong Kong.

147
00:07:21,854 --> 00:07:24,146
- I wore them because my face is puffy.
- What's wrong with your face?

148
00:07:24,147 --> 00:07:25,783
Just hurry up and do it.

149
00:07:25,784 --> 00:07:28,045
Why, you want to see?
This is what I look like.

150
00:07:28,593 --> 00:07:31,087
[Frightened!]

151
00:07:31,747 --> 00:07:33,222
Everyone, look over here.

152
00:07:33,223 --> 00:07:35,594
Here, I go.
One, two, three.

153
00:07:35,595 --> 00:07:38,797
[Space aliens... enjoy yourselves now.]

154
00:07:38,798 --> 00:07:41,685
[Because things you never even dreamed of
will soon start happening.]

155
00:07:41,686 --> 00:07:43,754
Here, I go.
One, two, three.

156
00:07:44,649 --> 00:07:45,807
Three.

157
00:08:01,556 --> 00:08:03,054
Where are we?

158
00:08:05,003 --> 00:08:09,017
[Running Man aliens having been
transported somewhere.]

159
00:08:09,017 --> 00:08:10,017
Yeouido?

160
00:08:10,018 --> 00:08:11,763
Isn't this Yeouido Park?

161
00:08:14,579 --> 00:08:16,992
[What is the reason for them
being transported to this location?]

162
00:08:17,764 --> 00:08:19,293
What is this?

163
00:08:20,002 --> 00:08:22,296
What is this cellphone doing here?

164
00:08:22,722 --> 00:08:24,486
What is this?

165
00:08:24,487 --> 00:08:28,131
[Every alien is given a mysterious item,
and a cellphone.]

166
00:08:28,132 --> 00:08:29,602
Is this what I chose?

167
00:08:29,603 --> 00:08:32,218
[The earthling item that
Kwang Soo chose is a mannequin.]

168
00:08:32,466 --> 00:08:33,975
The mannequin itself?

169
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,148
Everyone, this is my friend,
Kang San Yi.

170
00:08:37,644 --> 00:08:39,125
Say hello, Kang San Yi.

171
00:08:41,290 --> 00:08:42,988
He tends to be pretty shy.

172
00:08:44,029 --> 00:08:45,135
The little scoundrel.

173
00:08:46,032 --> 00:08:47,209
We got a text.

174
00:08:47,442 --> 00:08:52,353
Space aliens, we will test you to see how
well you've disguised yourself as earthlings.

175
00:08:52,647 --> 00:08:54,489
<i>Those of you that have chosen
an earthly item</i>

176
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:58,597
<i>must avoid other teams' search parties who
are disguised as earthlings with their bells</i>

177
00:08:58,598 --> 00:09:01,609
<i>and find your team's UFO that
is hidden somewhere in this park.</i>

178
00:09:04,935 --> 00:09:08,496
If your name tag is ripped off by anyone
wearing a bell, you are immediately ousted.

179
00:09:08,497 --> 00:09:11,881
You must make sure to carry your
earthly item with you to the end.

180
00:09:12,263 --> 00:09:15,608
What do I do?
I don't have to respond to this, do I?

181
00:09:16,413 --> 00:09:20,176
Wow... seriously.
Of all things, this is what I chose?

182
00:09:21,566 --> 00:09:23,421
This is so unfair.

183
00:09:23,422 --> 00:09:24,786
What the heck is this?

184
00:09:24,787 --> 00:09:28,623
How am I supposed to carry this around?
I can't even lift this thing.

185
00:09:29,397 --> 00:09:31,027
This is about to drive me insane.

186
00:09:31,366 --> 00:09:33,629
Why did I have to choose this thing?

187
00:09:35,306 --> 00:09:37,940
[All the earthly items are things
that will make them stand out in a crowd.]

188
00:09:39,427 --> 00:09:42,690
[Since you're already in this situation,
run quickly and find your UFO!]

189
00:09:42,691 --> 00:09:44,791
I'm supposed to carry this around
to the end?

190
00:09:48,095 --> 00:09:49,211
Just hang on.

191
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:52,431
How am I supposed to find anything
with this on my back?

192
00:09:52,432 --> 00:09:54,225
How am I supposed to find
the UFO like this?

193
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:00,023
No!

194
00:10:00,024 --> 00:10:02,041
No!

195
00:10:02,613 --> 00:10:04,905
Hey.
Put that thing on here.

196
00:10:07,478 --> 00:10:08,623
Hey.

197
00:10:09,159 --> 00:10:11,842
- Look at Ha Ha.
- Where is he?

198
00:10:11,843 --> 00:10:13,787
He's over there carrying around a tent.

199
00:10:14,557 --> 00:10:17,775
- How are we supposed to stay hidden?
- How are we supposed to stay hidden?

200
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:20,143
I should hide somewhere.

201
00:10:21,005 --> 00:10:22,760
This stands out too much.

202
00:10:22,761 --> 00:10:26,887
[Standing out like a sore thumb
no matter where he goes.]

203
00:10:29,373 --> 00:10:32,005
I have to stay hidden.
This is driving me crazy.

204
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,978
What the heck is this UFO?

205
00:10:35,406 --> 00:10:38,908
- I think I saw Lee Kwang Soo earlier.
- It won't be easy to eliminate Ji Hyo.

206
00:10:38,909 --> 00:10:40,644
I'm going to go after Lee Kwang Soo.

207
00:10:40,645 --> 00:10:43,291
[Alien hunters also arrives at Yeouido Park.]

208
00:10:43,292 --> 00:10:46,989
[Jae Suk, Jong Kook and Gary are the hunters
from each of the three teams.]

209
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:49,988
[With the sound of their ringing bells,
they start their hunt right away.]

210
00:10:49,989 --> 00:10:51,290
What's with the umbrellas?

211
00:10:53,526 --> 00:10:55,917
[So many people walking around the park
with their umbrellas in hand.]

212
00:10:56,706 --> 00:10:59,136
Wow... there are so many out here.

213
00:11:00,893 --> 00:11:03,395
How am I supposed to find them
with all these people out here?

214
00:11:08,768 --> 00:11:11,884
[Alien Sandara with her
erect antenna.]

215
00:11:15,797 --> 00:11:17,658
I have to find the UFO.

216
00:11:19,589 --> 00:11:23,424
I don't know how I'm going to find it.
What does the UFO look like?

217
00:11:23,981 --> 00:11:25,695
I'm really curious to know.

218
00:11:30,562 --> 00:11:32,556
Oh my goodness, seriously!

219
00:11:32,557 --> 00:11:34,740
I can't even do anything with this.

220
00:11:42,522 --> 00:11:45,134
I bet all these kids would be shocked
to find out that I'm an alien.

221
00:11:45,135 --> 00:11:47,580
[You're already plenty strange.]

222
00:11:47,581 --> 00:11:52,301
Since there are so many kids here,
I can disguise the tent as one of the kid's.

223
00:11:52,302 --> 00:11:53,605
Ma'am!

224
00:11:53,606 --> 00:11:56,226
I brought a tent with me so that
the baby doesn't get wet in the rain.

225
00:11:56,227 --> 00:11:58,708
Why don't you bring the baby
and sit in the tent?

226
00:11:59,808 --> 00:12:02,731
Should we close this up?

227
00:12:02,732 --> 00:12:05,378
Just sit right there, okay?

228
00:12:05,379 --> 00:12:06,608
[Completes his perfect disguise with
the help of the grandmother with the baby.]

229
00:12:06,609 --> 00:12:08,894
[Is this a little snail house?]

230
00:12:09,604 --> 00:12:12,358
You have to let me know if
you see Jae Suk coming by.

231
00:12:12,359 --> 00:12:13,450
[Just then!]

232
00:12:16,392 --> 00:12:18,058
See?
He doesn't even notice.

233
00:12:18,059 --> 00:12:20,570
No way for them to know that I'm here.
Isn't this a great idea?

234
00:12:22,566 --> 00:12:24,488
This is the perfect disguise.

235
00:12:29,872 --> 00:12:31,066
Too many mosquitoes.

236
00:12:31,067 --> 00:12:33,708
[With all the mosquitoes in the woods...]

237
00:12:33,709 --> 00:12:35,325
There are way too many
mosquitoes out here.

238
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:39,774
Since I'm not strong enough,
I won't be able to battle them physically.

239
00:12:39,775 --> 00:12:42,112
So my plan of action is to run
away from them.

240
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:53,902
- Sandara!
- Oh my God!

241
00:12:53,903 --> 00:12:56,194
[Discovered by Hunter Mr. Capable!]

242
00:12:56,195 --> 00:12:58,344
Oh my God!
I can't die already!

243
00:12:58,345 --> 00:12:59,860
Sandara!

244
00:12:59,861 --> 00:13:01,922
There's Jae Suk!

245
00:13:02,536 --> 00:13:04,581
- Sandara!
- Sandara!

246
00:13:04,582 --> 00:13:07,786
[Jae Suk and Jong Kook hot on
Sandara's tail!]

247
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:11,349
[Rule- Alien hunters can utilize bicycles.]

248
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:13,285
You stand out too much with that hair!

249
00:13:13,286 --> 00:13:15,591
No!
I have to get away!

250
00:13:15,592 --> 00:13:17,240
Sandara Park!

251
00:13:18,845 --> 00:13:23,395
[Bom and Minzy from the Pink Alien Team
joins in on the chase!]

252
00:13:23,396 --> 00:13:26,093
- Come on, Jae Suk! Come get her!
- That's right!

253
00:13:26,094 --> 00:13:29,086
[Sandara of the Orange Alien Team
is completely surrounded!]

254
00:13:29,087 --> 00:13:31,626
Sandara!
Be careful not to hurt yourself.

255
00:13:31,661 --> 00:13:35,003
- Sandara! Get off the ground!
- You have to get her!

256
00:13:37,062 --> 00:13:38,877
Be careful not to hurt your head.

257
00:13:42,787 --> 00:13:44,658
- Yes!
- Hurry up and run!

258
00:13:44,853 --> 00:13:47,820
[With amazing teamwork,
Pink Team ousts Sandara!]

259
00:13:49,539 --> 00:13:51,384
Okay, this is good.
Let's just keep staying here.

260
00:13:53,325 --> 00:13:55,549
This is the first time I've been on a show
like this in four years.

261
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:57,298
I can't believe that I'm ousted
as soon as the show starts.

262
00:13:58,115 --> 00:14:01,840
Hey, but this hair of yours is
way too cute.

263
00:14:02,005 --> 00:14:05,757
It's because of this hair of yours.
You can't hide with that antenna hair.

264
00:14:05,758 --> 00:14:08,099
[As soon as the hunt starts, Sandara is out!]

265
00:14:11,275 --> 00:14:12,681
Minzy.

266
00:14:13,806 --> 00:14:15,068
I'm sorry.

267
00:14:15,069 --> 00:14:17,955
[Moments before Minzy is about to be
captured by Jong Kook.]

268
00:14:20,563 --> 00:14:23,582
[Minzy's teammate, Alien Jae Suk
blocking Jong Kook's path.]

269
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:25,391
Look at Minzy's face.
Look at how exhausted she looks right now.

270
00:14:25,392 --> 00:14:28,671
That's why I'm going to end her
suffering for her right now.

271
00:14:29,096 --> 00:14:31,698
[Minzy throwing herself
down onto the ground.]

272
00:14:31,723 --> 00:14:33,561
Listen to me.

273
00:14:33,562 --> 00:14:35,465
- Just give me a break just this once.
- I can understand what you're saying.

274
00:14:35,466 --> 00:14:37,306
- I'm sorry.
- Come on, please!

275
00:14:37,307 --> 00:14:39,282
Sandara just joined the game too,
but she's already out.

276
00:14:40,325 --> 00:14:43,628
- I can't believe you ousted her already.
- I'm going to stop you from getting to her.

277
00:14:43,629 --> 00:14:44,989
Get out of my way!

278
00:14:47,045 --> 00:14:49,815
[Jae Suk's desperate attempt to
save Minzy from getting ousted.]

279
00:14:51,063 --> 00:14:54,448
- Minzy, I really am sorry.
- Why me of all people?

280
00:14:54,449 --> 00:14:55,726
The reason why is because...

281
00:14:56,167 --> 00:14:57,865
[Makes her escape once again.]

282
00:14:57,866 --> 00:14:58,900
I said, get out of my way!

283
00:14:59,913 --> 00:15:01,614
Ouch, that hurts!
That hurts!

284
00:15:01,615 --> 00:15:03,626
That hurts!
I said, that hurts!

285
00:15:03,627 --> 00:15:05,231
That hurts!
Stop it!

286
00:15:10,983 --> 00:15:13,539
[Minzy takes advantage of the time
and makes her escape far away.]

287
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:16,052
Don't grab me with the name tag.
That really hurts.

288
00:15:16,053 --> 00:15:17,710
Do you want to know how that hurts?
Give me that.

289
00:15:17,711 --> 00:15:19,306
You want to see how much that hurts?

290
00:15:22,082 --> 00:15:23,304
That hurts, doesn't it?

291
00:15:23,305 --> 00:15:24,696
- That hurts!
- Hurts, doesn't it?

292
00:15:24,697 --> 00:15:26,085
That hurts!

293
00:15:27,124 --> 00:15:29,121
- Where's Kwang Soo?
- We can go find him.

294
00:15:29,122 --> 00:15:30,810
- Tell me where Kwang Soo is.
- Let's try to find him.

295
00:15:31,575 --> 00:15:33,961
- I'm sorry.
- Here. Take that with you.

296
00:15:35,239 --> 00:15:36,360
Seriously.

297
00:15:38,345 --> 00:15:39,852
What kind of an item is this?

298
00:15:39,853 --> 00:15:43,135
[Extremely displeased with
their earthly items.]

299
00:15:43,136 --> 00:15:46,402
- It could've been a cellphone or something.
- Something small that we can carry.

300
00:15:46,403 --> 00:15:47,700
What's this UFO?

301
00:15:47,701 --> 00:15:49,941
[On top of everything else, they
don't even know what the UFO looks like.]

302
00:15:49,942 --> 00:15:52,351
Do you think it could be this?
Since we're aliens...

303
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:54,810
Do you think it could be a car?

304
00:15:56,422 --> 00:15:58,745
It was the UFO that supposedly
brought us here, isn't it?

305
00:15:59,253 --> 00:16:01,392
[A very likely deduction.]

306
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,499
Could it be some sort of
transportation?

307
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:06,059
[The UFO that they're supposed to find
is a mode of transportation for the teams?]

308
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:07,315
I think you're right.

309
00:16:07,316 --> 00:16:09,258
Wow, you're really smart.

310
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:10,892
Just trust me and follow my lead.

311
00:16:10,893 --> 00:16:13,004
Wow, you're seriously so smart.

312
00:16:13,005 --> 00:16:14,849
Okay, let's hurry.
Let's hurry and find it.

313
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:16,759
Just trust me and follow my lead, okay?

314
00:16:17,112 --> 00:16:18,488
Be quiet!

315
00:16:18,489 --> 00:16:21,465
- I'm going to shock you today.
- You with your four arms.

316
00:16:21,466 --> 00:16:23,946
- What do you mean, I have four arms?
- Look at you with your four arms.

317
00:16:23,947 --> 00:16:25,408
[Alien with four arms attached.]

318
00:16:25,409 --> 00:16:28,726
- You have arms sticking out of your pockets.
- No, I'm just borrowing them for a bit.

319
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:31,393
- You need to escape.
- Did you run into anyone?

320
00:16:31,394 --> 00:16:34,769
Kim Jong Kook and Jae Suk are
over there fighting right now.

321
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:37,165
Jae Suk's trying to stop Jong Kook
from eliminating me.

322
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:38,830
You have to be careful.

323
00:16:39,865 --> 00:16:42,298
- It's Gary.
- We need to hide.

324
00:16:43,028 --> 00:16:45,661
[Orange Team's Hunter,
Gary is approaching!]

325
00:16:48,397 --> 00:16:49,999
Hey!
Your arm!

326
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,997
Kwang Soo!
You dropped your mannequin's arm!

327
00:16:54,575 --> 00:16:56,018
Hey, Lee Kwang Soo!

328
00:16:56,541 --> 00:16:59,634
[Coming too close for comfort to Gary
in his attempt to retrieve the arm.]

329
00:17:00,011 --> 00:17:01,413
Jae Suk, help me!

330
00:17:01,414 --> 00:17:03,042
Come on, Gary.

- What do you think you're going to do?
- I have four hands.

so nice and kind now.

When I first met CL,
I thought she would be screaming out my name.

456

I thought that she would be
really rambunctious.

Screaming out everything she says.

458

I thought everything she said
would be really loud and upbeat.

459

I didn't know that's the kind
of image that I had.

in front of me.

please have a convertible ready for her.

472

- We came here with the sunroof open.
- She could barely even drive.

473
00:24:26,307 --> 00:24:31,176
Since CL came on the show with full makeup on,
know that she's going to be wearing goggles.

474

[CL has to wear goggles during the water game
since she has her full makeup on?]

- No, it's okay.
- And the thing is...

476

Asking us why we waited so long to ask
them on the show in her tone.

484

During our drive here,
she sat so demurely like this.

- What is this?
- Listen here.

486
00:24:57,602 --> 00:25:00,988

a brat today?

[Wanting to team up together
to get rid of Jong Kook first?]

503

You can't be thinking of that, are you?

504
00:25:50,735 --> 00:25:52,973
Wait, let's just wait it out while those
two teams fight it out amongst themselves.

[Attack, you say?]

509
00:26:06,638 --> 00:26:08,511
<i>I'm the best...</i>

510
00:26:09,767 --> 00:26:12,752
[Bom is the first to launch
a preemptive strike!]

511
00:26:12,753 --> 00:26:15,240
[She launches herself at
her easiest target, Suk Jin!]

512
00:26:15,241 --> 00:26:16,464
Why are you doing this to me?

513
00:26:16,465 --> 00:26:18,403

drive Suk Jin back!]

against her will.]

Orange Team's Sandara gets ousted!]

532
00:27:40,281 --> 00:27:44,193
[Ji Hyo tries to push her off, but... oh!]

533
00:27:44,194 --> 00:27:49,152
[Minzy counterattacks Ji Hyo's attack?]

534
00:27:49,153 --> 00:27:51,816
[Impressive skills by Minzy!]

535
00:27:57,059 --> 00:27:58,941

- There's one left!
- There's only one left!

548
00:28:48,638 --> 00:28:50,613
What are you doing?
You should've taken her out with you.

549
00:28:51,682 --> 00:28:55,134
[It's been a long while since Ji Hyo's lost
to anyone in regards to strength and skills.]

550
00:28:55,482 --> 00:28:57,349
Minzy!
You can do it!

551
00:28:57,350 --> 00:28:58,984

[What?
He's going to lift her up?]

553
00:29:01,261 --> 00:29:03,418

00:29:20,495 --> 00:29:22,889
Hey, Jong Kook.
How about you only use one of your hands?

561
00:29:22,890 --> 00:29:25,523
No, just do it.
I think Minzy will be just fine.

562
00:29:30,132 --> 00:29:32,070
[While Minzy momentarily
has her guard down...]

563

[Current standing-
Green Team- 1; Orange Team- 0; Pink Team- 0.]

567
00:29:52,209 --> 00:29:54,598

won against a girl.

568
00:29:55,195 --> 00:29:57,239
- What did you say?
- Good for you!

Her strength is no joke.

572
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:08,291
You know who Yoon Eun Hye is,
don't you?

573
00:30:08,292 --> 00:30:11,647
Yoon Eun Hye was the female warrior back
in the day when we used to be on X-Man.

574
00:30:11,924 --> 00:30:13,986
I think you need to take over that title.

575
00:30:13,987 --> 00:30:16,282
Then it means that you and Jong Kook
need to be the new love couple!

576
00:30:16,597 --> 00:30:18,169

You two take care of it yourselves.

591
00:31:18,246 --> 00:31:20,742

breathe and walk around.

592
00:31:24,827 --> 00:31:27,344
[Sense of danger with the Tiger
standing his ground.]

593
00:31:27,345 --> 00:31:29,600

- What are you talking about?

594
00:31:31,087 --> 00:31:32,594
[Tiger attacks!]

595
00:31:32,595 --> 00:31:35,119

[Orange Team's Gary- Out!]

601
00:32:09,277 --> 00:32:10,510
Let me go up against Suk Jin one on one.

602
00:32:11,105 --> 00:32:13,031
- Let me go up against Suk Jin on my own.
- Not you, but Minzy.

603
00:32:13,032 --> 00:32:14,412
Me?

604
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:17,281
- Let's go a round.
- Okay, you and Minzy go a round.

605
00:32:17,282 --> 00:32:20,153
No, I can't go up against my father.

606

[Female Warrior not easy to take down!]

610
00:32:47,367 --> 00:32:48,592

[Kwang Soo seems to be eyeing Suk Jin?]

612
00:32:52,555 --> 00:32:54,531
If you can't take Minzy down,
I'll take her down for you.

613

I'm not going to go easy on you.

631

[I'll give you a piece of warning myself!]

634

Lee Seung Chul's 'Don't say hello.'

827
00:47:22,002 --> 00:47:23,861
- It's a mix of that song with something else.
- Right?

828
00:47:23,862 --> 00:47:25,831
Then what else is mixed in there?

829
00:47:25,832 --> 00:47:27,646
- Can we listen to it once more.
- Just a little bit more.

830
00:47:27,852 --> 00:47:31,737
[We invite the viewers to play along.
There are three songs mixed into this song.]

831
00:47:32,992 --> 00:47:34,447
Keep it down.

832
00:47:34,448 --> 00:47:36,799
I think I hear Koyote in there.

833
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:41,345
What is that one song by Koyote?
Pure Love or something...

834
00:47:42,583 --> 00:47:45,993
[Easily remembering all the lyrics.]

835
00:47:47,345 --> 00:47:48,683
What's the name of that song?

836
00:47:51,519 --> 00:47:54,724
[We invite the viewers to play along.
There are three songs mixed into this song.]

837
00:48:08,026 --> 00:48:10,011
- Ah! This is going to drive me crazy!
- Why? What is it?

838
00:48:10,012 --> 00:48:14,470
[He can't seem to be remembering
the title of the song either.]

839
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:16,152
- You know that song?
- Ah!

840
00:48:18,471 --> 00:48:20,795
- Unconditionally!
- Yes! Unconditionally!

841
00:48:21,759 --> 00:48:24,735
[But there's more than one song
mixed in there...]

842
00:48:26,417 --> 00:48:33,469
[How many songs are mixed in there?
And what are the song titles?]

843
00:48:35,249 --> 00:48:37,059
- Lee Ha Yi!
- Where are we going? Recording room?

844
00:48:37,739 --> 00:48:39,751
- I think that it's here.
- Is it the practice room?

845
00:48:40,551 --> 00:48:42,283
Yes! We found her!

846
00:48:42,284 --> 00:48:44,151
Yes, there she is!

847
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:49,272
[Finally found Lee Ha Yi!]

848
00:48:51,908 --> 00:48:57,137
[K-POP Star Season I,
runner up winner, Lee Ha Yi.]

849
00:48:58,441 --> 00:49:02,213
[Signed on with YG Entertainment since and
is a new artist with a successful new album.]

850
00:49:02,214 --> 00:49:04,200
- Hello.
- Okay, tell us what we need to do.

851
00:49:04,201 --> 00:49:05,303
Okay, what do we have to do?

852
00:49:05,304 --> 00:49:08,588
As you see in front of you,
there are 3 and 5 liter water pitchers.

853
00:49:08,589 --> 00:49:13,072
By utilizing these pitchers only,
you have to somehow make four liters of water.

854
00:49:13,073 --> 00:49:15,152
Then you'll get the hint as to
where your next location is.

855
00:49:15,153 --> 00:49:16,792
- Wait, can you repeat that?
- I don't get it.

856
00:49:16,793 --> 00:49:19,195
So we have to use these two
to make four liters.

857
00:49:19,196 --> 00:49:21,753
This is three liters and this is five liters.

858
00:49:21,754 --> 00:49:24,340
So if we use the three liter pitcher
to pour it in there...

859
00:49:27,728 --> 00:49:29,129
What does that mean?

860
00:49:35,105 --> 00:49:39,619
[This is hard...]

861
00:49:41,423 --> 00:49:43,152
Can you play it for us one more time?

862
00:49:50,586 --> 00:49:54,393
[It seems as though they figured out
that 'Unconditionally' is in there?]

863
00:49:54,394 --> 00:49:55,951
How do you know that song?

864
00:49:57,111 --> 00:49:58,713
- Unconditionally!
- Unconditionally.

865
00:49:58,714 --> 00:50:02,026
- Park Sang Chul's 'Unconditionally'.
- Oh my goodness.

866
00:50:02,027 --> 00:50:04,065
Then what are the titles of the
three songs mixed in there?

867
00:50:04,066 --> 00:50:07,134
Unconditionally, Don't say Hello, and...

868
00:50:08,607 --> 00:50:11,016
Why can't I think of that title?

869
00:50:14,377 --> 00:50:15,797
No, I don't know.

870
00:50:17,237 --> 00:50:19,182
[Yoo Hyuk trying to cheat.]

871
00:50:22,587 --> 00:50:25,442
If you happen to know any of
the Rascal Musician's songs...

872
00:50:25,442 --> 00:50:28,392
- Of course, I know!
- Then I'll tell you a letter to the answer.

873
00:50:28,393 --> 00:50:29,824
Yes, of course I know their songs.

874
00:50:33,882 --> 00:50:35,952
Jae Suk, that's not it.

875
00:50:35,953 --> 00:50:38,290
[That's a CM song...]

876
00:50:38,291 --> 00:50:41,980
- You know that's not the right song.
- But that's a very famous song.

877
00:50:41,981 --> 00:50:43,802
Famous or not, it's wrong.

878
00:50:44,790 --> 00:50:47,780
[Rascal Musician's 'Attractive'.]

879
00:50:47,781 --> 00:50:49,600
I can sing the chorus for you
if you can sing it.

880
00:50:49,601 --> 00:50:52,032
[Wanting to sing a duet with Soo Hyun?]

881
00:50:55,792 --> 00:50:57,612
Why does your singing sound
so lecherous?

882
00:50:57,613 --> 00:50:59,800
- The way you sing it sounds lecherous.
- What do you mean, lecherous?

883
00:50:59,801 --> 00:51:03,433
He is acting very lecherous lately.
Bom already gave him two warnings today.

884
00:51:03,434 --> 00:51:06,131
- He keeps trying to lure Minzy.
- I'm not trying to lure her!

885
00:51:06,132 --> 00:51:08,998
Why do you keep doing that?
She's should be like your younger sister.

886
00:51:09,473 --> 00:51:12,362
You two are seriously trying to
drive me up the wall, aren't you?

887
00:51:13,566 --> 00:51:15,690
- Yeon.
- Yeon In! (Celebrity)

888
00:51:17,193 --> 00:51:18,829
- Celebrity.
- Are you sure?

889
00:51:18,830 --> 00:51:20,913
- Sil Yeon! (Broken hearted).
- Yes, Sil Yeon!

890
00:51:20,914 --> 00:51:22,540
- Sil Yeon!
- Sil Yeon!

891
00:51:23,176 --> 00:51:24,475
Then tell me the names of all three songs.

892
00:51:24,476 --> 00:51:27,587
Unconditionally, Don't say Hello,
and Broken Hearted!

893
00:51:28,476 --> 00:51:32,490
[Could that be the correct answer?]

894
00:51:35,287 --> 00:51:40,128
[Lee Seung Chul- Don't say Hello.]

895
00:51:40,129 --> 00:51:44,776
[Koyote- Broken Hearted.]

896
00:51:44,777 --> 00:51:48,688
[Park Sang Chul- Unconditionally.]

897
00:51:52,066 --> 00:51:53,802
- That's the correct answer.
- Yes!

898
00:51:56,784 --> 00:51:58,769
- Now that you've got the correct answer...
- Yes?

899
00:51:58,770 --> 00:52:01,369
- The hint is within the answer.
- You have to rearrange the letters.

900
00:52:02,167 --> 00:52:06,573
[Don't say Hello... Broken Hearted...
and Unconditionally...]

901
00:52:06,574 --> 00:52:08,059
Is it the choreography room?

902
00:52:10,289 --> 00:52:12,378
- The first letter of everything is that.
- That's it, let's go.

903
00:52:12,379 --> 00:52:15,410
- It is the choreography room.
- Thanks, Soo Hyun.

904
00:52:15,411 --> 00:52:17,556
- Thank you!
- Bye!

905
00:52:17,557 --> 00:52:19,986
- We'll see you later!
- Thanks, we'll see you later.

906
00:52:19,987 --> 00:52:21,586
Off to the choreography room.

907
00:52:21,587 --> 00:52:24,434
We can't experiment around by
pouring the water into something else, right?

908
00:52:24,435 --> 00:52:27,092
We can only use these two pitchers?

909
00:52:31,969 --> 00:52:34,106
- I got it?
- You got something?

910
00:52:34,107 --> 00:52:36,358
- I got it!
- What is it?

911
00:52:37,488 --> 00:52:39,879
- Can you explain it us?
- Yes, explain it to us.

912
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:41,062
[The two kids feeling frustrated.]

913
00:52:42,219 --> 00:52:45,316
[First fill up the five liter to the brim?]

914
00:52:45,774 --> 00:52:49,218
Fill it up like this,
and pour out three liters.

915
00:52:49,881 --> 00:52:52,286
- Then there are two liters left.
- Yes, and you throw it out.

916
00:52:52,287 --> 00:52:55,267
- Throw out the three liters.
- Okay, throw this out.

917
00:52:55,268 --> 00:52:58,498
- Then, we pour the two liters into this.
- Okay, I get it.

918
00:52:58,499 --> 00:53:01,792
[Pour the remaining two liters
into the three liter pitcher.]

919
00:53:01,793 --> 00:53:04,974
Then you fill up the five liters again.

920
00:53:04,975 --> 00:53:07,279
That's exactly what I was about to do.

921
00:53:08,006 --> 00:53:09,746
Okay, fill up the five liters.

922
00:53:11,050 --> 00:53:12,296
Okay, I got it!

923
00:53:12,297 --> 00:53:16,123
If you fill that up and dump one liter to fill
up the three pitchers, then you got it.

924
00:53:16,124 --> 00:53:18,732
- That's right.
- Wow, bravo.

925
00:53:18,733 --> 00:53:21,746
- You actually understand her?
- Okay, watch this.

926
00:53:21,747 --> 00:53:25,529
- See how this has two liters?
- Yes, and this has five liters.

927
00:53:25,530 --> 00:53:28,676
So if you dump one liter into this one,
then four liters remain in this pitcher.

928
00:53:28,677 --> 00:53:30,815
[Four liters left remaining?]

929
00:53:30,816 --> 00:53:33,182

- Bravo!

- Fighting! Goodbye.
- See you later. Thanks.

[Up and down all over the hallways
of YG Entertainment.]

941
00:54:16,025 --> 00:54:17,710

- Yes.

942
00:54:21,203 --> 00:54:23,847
[This is the choreography room.]

943

[Orange Team also arrives
soon thereafter.]

946

From five liters...

[One person who still can't seem to
understand the liter problem.]

948

[And the Green Team is the last
to join the group.]

949

wear these step counters.

- You're not trainees?
- We're your seniors.

- We're your seniors.

- I have no competitive streak.

Look at the camera in front of you,
and call out what your number says.

1154
01:07:18,933 --> 01:07:20,318
I bet there's something in here.

1155
01:07:20,787 --> 01:07:28,207
[Where could the clues be hidden?]

1156
01:07:28,208 --> 01:07:29,404
- No, there's nothing.
- Nothing?

1157
01:07:30,449 --> 01:07:34,502
- Your total count is 524.
- It's more than that. I think we got it.

1158
01:07:34,503 --> 01:07:36,360
In that case...

1159
01:07:36,361 --> 01:07:39,763
[Taeyang seems to know where it is?]

1160
01:07:39,764 --> 01:07:41,435
- Lets go with that one.
- That's all we've got for now.

1161
01:07:41,436 --> 01:07:43,380
- Should we go with that one?
- Yes, let's go with that one.

1162
01:07:43,381 --> 01:07:46,789
Is this it?

1163
01:07:47,579 --> 01:07:48,987
Correct.
You may be on your way.

1164
01:07:54,287 --> 01:07:56,114
[Where could it be?]

1165
01:07:56,949 --> 01:07:58,919
Here it is.
What's this? This thing here.

1166
01:08:00,298 --> 01:08:01,616
- Isn't this it?
- That's what you found?

1167
01:08:01,962 --> 01:08:04,414
[A safe?]

1168
01:08:06,636 --> 01:08:10,400
[Green Team arrives at Room 604.]

1169
01:08:10,401 --> 01:08:11,918
Look at this.
What's this?

1170
01:08:11,919 --> 01:08:13,841
[Another safe?]

1171
01:08:13,842 --> 01:08:15,188
Is this normally here or not?

1172
01:08:15,189 --> 01:08:19,286
[Even Taeyang doesn't know if
it's normally there or not...]

1173
01:08:19,287 --> 01:08:22,728
This is odd though.
Why would the safe be here?

1174
01:08:22,729 --> 01:08:24,798
- Let's look for clues.
- And this is locked.

1175
01:08:24,799 --> 01:08:27,246
[The 30 year veteran is still
dancing away.]

1176
01:08:28,775 --> 01:08:31,141
[Couple dance unable to find their rhythm.]

1177
01:08:31,142 --> 01:08:32,360
Lift me up!

1178
01:08:43,045 --> 01:08:45,977
[Fiercely determined
dancing veteran and Giraffe.]

1179
01:08:46,918 --> 01:08:49,439
[Is Giraffe trying to develop
some new dance moves?]

1180
01:08:50,354 --> 01:08:53,435
[We won't count that as dancing.]

1181
01:08:56,204 --> 01:08:57,287
It's down.

1182
01:08:57,288 --> 01:09:00,053
[Less than their total count of 460.]

1183
01:09:00,054 --> 01:09:01,717
If it's on the fourth floor,
then it would be the manager's office.

1184
01:09:02,701 --> 01:09:05,017
- What's your guess?
- Room 403.

1185
01:09:05,018 --> 01:09:08,685
We're going to choose Room 403,
and the reason for that being...

1186
01:09:09,177 --> 01:09:10,637
What do you mean, 'shut up'?

1187
01:09:12,641 --> 01:09:16,586
[Pulling the Giraffe's leg with
every chance that he gets.]

1188
01:09:17,368 --> 01:09:19,187
- Correct answer. You may go.
- We got it!

1189
01:09:19,188 --> 01:09:20,605
[403 is the correct answer!]

1190
01:09:23,349 --> 01:09:26,236
- What could it be?
- What could the clue be?

1191
01:09:26,637 --> 01:09:29,114
- Look for something with the 'R' sticker.
- What do you think this is?

1192
01:09:29,115 --> 01:09:30,825
I found this.

1193
01:09:31,265 --> 01:09:33,995
[A sheet of music?]

1194
01:09:35,891 --> 01:09:38,163
- Oh, what's this?
- That also says February!

1195
01:09:38,164 --> 01:09:39,699
February, number two!

1196
01:09:41,319 --> 01:09:43,129
[Discovers a calendar.]

1197
01:09:43,887 --> 01:09:46,411
[This is also left on month, February!]

1198
01:09:46,412 --> 01:09:48,745
- Was this originally here?
- I don't think that this was originally here.

1199
01:09:48,746 --> 01:09:52,835
[Could the lock code for the safe have
something to do with the month, February?]

1200
01:09:52,836 --> 01:09:55,377
- Wait a second...
- It has to have something to do with two.

1201
01:09:55,378 --> 01:09:58,866
Can anyone read this sheet of music?

1202
01:10:01,962 --> 01:10:04,337
[Singing out the scale.]

1203
01:10:05,305 --> 01:10:08,597
But take a look at this.
Why is this the only thing marked in red?

1204
01:10:08,598 --> 01:10:11,294
- I think that means something.
- Right? This is the only thing marked in red.

1205
01:10:11,295 --> 01:10:12,420
[Only the first four music notes
are marked in red.]

1206
01:10:12,421 --> 01:10:14,750
Look at this.
This is the only thing marked like this.

1207
01:10:14,751 --> 01:10:16,589
The music sheet is titled 'February'.

1208
01:10:16,590 --> 01:10:19,419
- And the notes are marked in red.
- Could it be 0222?

1209
01:10:19,420 --> 01:10:21,889
- Why are only these four notes marked in red?
- Then what does this mean?

1210
01:10:21,890 --> 01:10:23,867
All the pages are the month of February.

1211
01:10:23,868 --> 01:10:26,907
The way I see it,
I think the number is within this page.

1212
01:10:26,908 --> 01:10:28,397
Yes, I'm sure.

1213
01:10:32,748 --> 01:10:34,524
[Pink Team having arrived in Room 403.]

1214
01:10:34,525 --> 01:10:36,038
- Running Man!
- Running Man!

1215
01:10:36,039 --> 01:10:38,099
- The computer says 'Running Man'.
- This is our clue!

1216
01:10:38,100 --> 01:10:40,886
We need the password for it.
Could it be in this calendar?

1217
01:10:42,373 --> 01:10:44,986
[The calendar in this room
is also turned to the month of February.]

1218
01:10:47,420 --> 01:10:49,991
- It's Do, Mi, Mi.
- Do, Mi, Mi, Mi?

1219
01:10:49,992 --> 01:10:52,351
- I'm really bad at things like this.
- I can't do it either.

1220
01:10:52,386 --> 01:10:54,894
- I'm confessing that right now.
- I'll confess too.

1221
01:10:55,678 --> 01:10:57,229
I'm usually good at this,
but this is pretty hard.

1222
01:11:00,587 --> 01:11:03,349
- It has something to do with number two.
- It has to do with the number, two.

1223
01:11:03,350 --> 01:11:05,714
Don't you think that it also has something
to do with this treble clef?

1224
01:11:06,523 --> 01:11:08,974
This is in red, and so is this.

1225
01:11:10,153 --> 01:11:12,247
What if it's like this?
In this order?

1226
01:11:12,248 --> 01:11:15,191
[Could there be a correlation between the
sheet music and the calendar?]

1227
01:11:17,169 --> 01:11:20,090
[Following the musical notes...]

1228
01:11:20,091 --> 01:11:22,018
[Could it be 8-2-3-4?]

1229
01:11:29,494 --> 01:11:32,191
[It opened!]

1230
01:11:33,798 --> 01:11:36,259
[The door to the safe is open!]

1231
01:11:39,251 --> 01:11:42,653
[Numbers 8-2-3-4 matches the
placement of the musical notes!]

1232
01:11:44,445 --> 01:11:46,535
I just got goose bumps.

1233
01:11:48,504 --> 01:11:50,805
The musical sheet really was the
clue to solving it.

1234
01:11:50,806 --> 01:11:52,701
Just who are you?

1235
01:11:53,214 --> 01:11:54,770
CL... Master C.

1236
01:11:54,771 --> 01:11:57,301
[She definitely is Master C.]

1237
01:11:57,302 --> 01:11:58,753
I like you.

1238
01:11:58,754 --> 01:12:00,755
- I'm going to confess that I like you.
- How did you do that?

1239
01:12:00,756 --> 01:12:02,511
I need an intelligent woman like you.

match the music sheet to the calendar.]

1242
01:12:10,751 --> 01:12:12,772
Do you know what you're doing?

1243
01:12:16,507 --> 01:12:18,518
8, 2, 3, 4?

1244
01:12:18,519 --> 01:12:20,321
- 8, 2, 3, 4?
- 8, 2, 3, 4.

1245
01:12:21,670 --> 01:12:22,830
8, 2, 3, 4!

Bom did it!

[The final location-
YG's rooftop outdoor garden.]

1250
01:12:52,037 --> 01:12:55,505
[Orange Team is the first to arrive.]

1251

[Orange Team will not lose any water
from having been the first team to arrive.]

1252
01:13:02,699 --> 01:13:05,118
Wow, by the split of a hair.

[Second place winner, Pink Team
loses two liters of water.]

1254

[Last place winner- Green Team.]

1256
01:13:15,114 --> 01:13:19,085

[Green Team loses four liters of water

1258

But it's still not too bad.

1259
01:13:25,099 --> 01:13:26,648
We have to drink all this water?

1260
01:13:28,209 --> 01:13:31,559
- We have the least amount of water.
- No, it's okay.

1261

Why is it so hard to find them?

1270
01:14:27,719 --> 01:14:29,834
It's like a treasure hunt.

No, not yet.

Should I go dunk myself in the water?

1300
01:16:31,945 --> 01:16:33,977
We should gather up all of the
water in the jug.

1301
01:16:41,790 --> 01:16:43,560
You can really gather the
water like that?

1302

No way!

1303
01:16:45,847 --> 01:16:48,663

[Could it be among all the bikes?]

1311
01:17:09,582 --> 01:17:11,565
I didn't search very thoroughly.

Something could be here.
