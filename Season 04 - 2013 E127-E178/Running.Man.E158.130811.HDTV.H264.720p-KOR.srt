00:00:01,630 --> 00:00:04,070
[Lee Kwang Soo's hide and go seek?]

3
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:12,710
[Just why does Kwang Soo
have to hide?]

4
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:17,500
[The story of a man who must
stay in hiding.]

5
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:20,430
[I really want to go home.]

6
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:23,200
['S' shopping mall in Incheon.]

7
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:25,270
Okay, what do we have here today?

8
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:29,810
[Huh? Something feels amiss?]

9
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:32,980
Kwang Soo said he can't come until later on
because of his drama shooting schedule.

10
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:35,320
Why is he pulling this stunt when
he's not even on the show much?

11
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:38,520
- So Kwang Soo's not coming today?
- He's coming later on this afternoon.

12
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,110
[The opening scene is a little quieter
without Kwang Soo on set.]

13
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:45,640
He said if he doesn't make it big this year,
he's just going to stick to variety shows.

14
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,410
- Really? This is his last year?
- Yes, he promised me.

15
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:50,760
- Then he doesn't have much time left.
- Your guests are making their entrances.

16
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:56,710
[Wow! A fancy van that only the
top stars are known to ride around in.]

17
00:00:56,710 --> 00:00:58,880
- I have a feeling that it's an actor.
- Whoever it is, they're in a nice van.

18
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,740
- It's got to be a top actor.
- Could it be an idol?

19
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:06,360
[Just who is the top star that's making
their entrance in this van?]

20
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,580
Kwang Soo usually runs up there to
open up the door for them.

21
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:10,020
Yes, he usually does that.

22
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:12,470
- Someone is about to step out.
- It's not going to be Kwang Soo, is it?

23
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:29,270
[Actor, Son Hyun Joo- The man
known for his amazing acting skills!]

24
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:33,880
[Actor Son Hyun Joo who needs
no other words of introduction.]

25
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:36,890
It's Son Hyun Joo!

26
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:41,420
[Actress, Moon Jung Hee-
Actress with stellar acting skills.]

27
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:45,410
[And top star, Jun Mi Sun-
Making waves on the screen.]

28
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,010
[The two actresses who can stir up
the emotions of the audiences are here.]

29
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:56,610
[A shopping mall that has suddenly turned into
a film set with the appearance of these three.]

30
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:58,910
- Son Hyun Joo is here.
- He really is here on the show.

31
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:01,280
He's wearing his mic like he
would wear a gun.

32
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:03,780
[First time seeing a guest wear the mic belt
on top of his clothes.]

33
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:07,360
[Because he's so new to
guesting on variety shows...]

34
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:09,340
It doesn't really matter if you
wear it over your clothes.

35
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:10,780
You look cool no matter what.

36
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:15,020
[If Son Hyun Joo wears it that way,
then it becomes instant fashion trend.]

37
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:17,240
We've really been hoping to
see you on the show.

38
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,600
Yes, we've really been anticipating it.

39
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:23,560
Whenever we've had other guests like
Sang Joon, we always asked for you.

40
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,880
- Yes, I saw the episode when he was on.
- Oh, you watched it?

41
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,150
Sang Joon really got his share of betrayal
when he came out on our show.

42
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,270
- He was pretty weak.
- Weak? That's funny.

43
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:33,770
You have no idea how long we've
waited for you to be a guest.

44
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:35,620
Are these three going to be
our guests for the day?

45
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:37,380
- Let me tell you about today's race.
- Okay.

46
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:41,440
<i>It's a 'numbered
hide and go seek race'.</i>

47
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,690
[Today's race-
Numbered hide and go seek race.]

48
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:48,170
<i>You will each receive a number that
will be placed under your name tags.</i>

49
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:51,190
<i>You won't know which number will be
affixed on your backs either.</i>

50
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:53,160
[Even they themselves won't know which
number will be put on their backs.]

51
00:02:55,770 --> 00:03:00,600
[They will start to come out one by one
to receive their number for their backs.]

52
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:06,520
[They each have now chosen a number
between one and ten.]

53
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:13,010
<i>This game will not be played in teams,
but it will be played individually to the end.</i>

54
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:16,430
- And only one person will be the winner.
- Just one person?

55
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:19,290
<i>At the completion of each mission,
the person who won that mission</i>

56
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:22,740
<i>will be given a hint that will help them
figure out which number is on who's back.</i>

57
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:25,250
[Winner of each mission will be given clues
to help them figure out who has which number.]

58
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:27,880
<i>Hints as to which number means what,
and the like.</i>

59
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:30,890
An example of a clue is, 'People with these
numbers are all actors.'

60
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:32,480
- Ah, okay.
- Those are the types of clues.

61
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,350
<i>So while you're participating in the race,
you have to deduce who has which number</i>

62
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:38,410
<i>and make your way to
the final location.</i>

63
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:44,560
<i>So at the final location, you eliminate each
other by guessing which number they have.</i>

64
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:47,090
So you eliminate each other
by the use of their numbers?

65
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:49,220
<i>The last person to stay alive
is the ultimate winner.</i>

66
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:50,380
Okay, I understand.

67
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:53,830
<i>You have to judge for yourselves whether
sharing the clues you received</i>

68
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:57,040
<i>with others will be advantageous,
or disadvantageous to you.</i>

69
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,460
But Kwang Soo won't be able to
join us this morning.

70
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:02,490
- He should be here by this afternoon.
- He's shooting his drama right now.

71
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:04,200
- I'm pretty close with Kwang Soo.
- Really?

72
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:06,800
He talked about Kwang Soo
the whole way here.

73
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,610
Just wait a little bit longer, and
you'll get your chance to order him around.

74
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:10,060
You might become
closer to us than him.

75
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:12,200
He should be here right around lunch time.

76
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:14,800
[But...]

77
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:21,710
[The atmosphere... feels suspicious?]

78
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:28,750
[There's someone who stayed hidden and
witnessed this whole scene unfold...]

79
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:32,630
[Kwang Soo?]

80
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:34,800
They're here, they're here.

81
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:39,220
[What is Kwang Soo who's supposed to be
on his drama set doing here?]

82
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,420
[One hour prior to the opening scene.]

83
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:48,790
[In one of the rooms in the shopping mall...]

84
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:52,300
[Kwang Soo making
his appearance all by himself.]

85
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:56,890
[Wait... what is going on here?]

86
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,370
Hello.

87
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:03,560
[Unable to contain his excitement.]

88
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,060
It's been a while since
you've done this, hasn't it?

89
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:07,660
It's practically my first time!
What do you mean, 'it's been a while'?

90
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:09,390
Am I really going to be
doing this alone today?

91
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:10,540
Here.

92
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:14,060
[Passing off the mission.]

93
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:16,020
Lee Kwang Soo's Hide-and-Seek?

94
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:17,640
[Mission-
Lee Kwang Soo's Hide-and-Seek.]

95
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:20,550
Then does this mean...
that I'm the star of this episode?

96
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:25,310
Well, if that's the way you want to think,
you can think of it that way.

97
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,660
Come on, just tell me!

98
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:30,350
Rather than saying that you're the star,
since you're so tall in stature...

99
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:31,830
I'm the star of this episode!

100
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:34,110
My dear viewers!

101
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:35,450
At long last!

102
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:36,870
Thank you!

103
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:42,480
I promise...
that I won't disappoint you today.

104
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:45,480
Let me tell you the details
of your mission.

105
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:51,390
[Yes! I'm the star!
I'll do whatever you ask of me!]

106
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:56,450
[Ah... the mission is...
that's a little...]

107
00:05:56,450 --> 00:06:03,130
[Wow... I'm in big trouble.]

108
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:07,270
- Hello!
- Kwang Soo! What are you doing here?

109
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:09,010
- Hello, Jae Suk.
- Hello.

110
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:10,380
[All of the members coming
onto the scene.]

111
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:12,600
- Kwang Soo, when did you get here?
- Hello.

112
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:15,480
- You got a mission, didn't you?
- Everyone come have a seat.

113
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:18,760
- I smell the filthy stench of betrayal.
- What do you mean, smell of betrayal?

114
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:21,510
[Everyone suspicious at the sight of
Kwang Soo waiting for them in the room.]

115
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:23,220
- What's going on here?
- Why are you here before us?

116
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:25,580
- Please come in and have a seat.
- What's going on here?

117
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:27,270
Everyone have a seat and be quiet.

118
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:29,690
- What's going on here?
- Do you have a presentation to make?

119
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:31,680
Don't tell us to be quiet.

120
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:34,190
- What's going on here?
- He's been given some kind of a mission.

121
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:35,970
Are you hosting the show today?

122
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:39,630
No, not exactly hosting it.
Can you read this out loud for us?

123
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:42,480
- Lee Kwang Soo's Hide-and-Seek?
- Yes, that's correct.

124
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:45,820
The first mission is...
Lee Kwang Soo's Hide-and-Seek!

125
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:47,520
Lee Kwang Soo's Hide-and-Seek!

126
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:50,170
- That doesn't sound like any fun.
- Why not?

127
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:53,720
- Why are you saying that?
- Are you hiding, or will we be hiding?

128
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:56,430
- That really sounds lame.
- You're not going to do this then?

129
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:58,170
I have to explain this to you guys.

130
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:00,560
You're going to be shocked once you
find out how important my role is in all this.

131
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,220
- What is it?
- Today...

132
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:04,780
- There are going to be three guests.
- Really?

133
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:09,620
And also, the first mission is going to have
a subset of four smaller missions.

134
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:13,590
Of those four missions, those who come in
first through third place will pass.

135
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:14,840
Ah, pass?

136
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,400
And amongst those...

137
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,230
while you're doing those
four missions...

138
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:20,600
- You really are bad at explaining this.
- You're horrible at it!

139
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,670
Wait, hang on.
Give me a little time.

140
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:25,050
- You really are horrible at explaining.
- Give me a minute!

141
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:27,990
- Come on, and just get to the point!
- How long is your explanation going to take?

142
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:31,520
- Why are you so horrible at this?
- You're really frustrating us.

143
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,940
Once the three people pass the mission,
we'll go on to the next round.

144
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:35,940
There are four missions altogether.

145
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:38,990
And during the time it takes us
to complete those four missions

146
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:40,940
I have to complete my missions secretly.

147
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:44,650
- What does that mean?
- We're all on the same side.

148
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,580
All of you have to help me,
and if I end up getting caught...

149
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:49,600
then the mission ends right then and there.

150
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:51,670
And the scariest thing is...

151
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:54,120
we'll have to go into filming overtime.

152
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:58,680
The scariest thing about this whole thing
is that you're the star of this episode!

153
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:01,210
- That's the scariest thing of all!
- We all have to work together!

154
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:05,410
You have to succeed the mission before
the three guests pass their missions?

155
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:07,240
If I'm caught, it's all over.

156
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:10,780
- Feeling anxious, and the need to...
- Reasons to feel anxious?

157
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:14,260
There are game zones.

158
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,100
Other than myself...

159
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:18,030
What happens after this?

160
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,790
[Stuttering MC Kwang ultimately hands over
the explanation portion to the PD.]

161
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:24,290
I have no idea what he was talking about.

162
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:26,350
<i>There are four floors in this
shopping mall.</i>

163
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:29,380
<i>You're going to have to pass through
all four floors</i>

164
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:30,800
<i>by playing a different game
on each floor.</i>

165
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:33,470
<i>Each game can only be played
in that specific game zone.</i>

166
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:35,430
<i>Each floor has its own game zone.</i>

167
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,890
<i>You can only play those games
within that specific game zone.</i>

168
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,760
<i>But in order to start playing
those games</i>

169
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:43,760
<i>you have to find the tools needed
for each game.</i>

170
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:49,120
<i>So while you're looking for those game tools,
and while you're playing those games...</i>

171
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:53,680
<i>Lee Kwang Soo has to pass those games
without getting caught by the guests.</i>

172
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,850
- Okay, I think I finally get it now.
- Now it makes sense to me.

173
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:59,280
You all understand now? We have
to make sure that I don't get caught.

174
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:03,470
- Lee Kwang Soo can't be caught.
- Kwang Soo's greedy for the star role.

175
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:05,790
Because of that, he's always
trying to make himself stand out.

176
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:07,670
Greedy to be the star?

177
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:12,160
How about this? Why don't you
wear something over your head?

178
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,530
No, that'll just make him stand out
even more.

179
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:17,610
And you can't keep moving around either.
You have to stay in one place somewhere.

180
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:20,170
If I was just going to sit still,
then I'd be sitting still at home.

181
00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:23,730
Since you're so tall, you need
to crawl around on your knees.

182
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:27,040
You know where you should hide?
In a dark place somewhere.

183
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,780
[Suggesting that he stays in a dark place
where the camera can't even capture him?]

184
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:35,260
- What I meant was...
- Listen to what he's telling him.

185
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:39,380
He should only come out when it's
time to do one of the games.

186
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:42,450
When it's time for you to hide,
just stay hidden so that we can win.

187
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:45,810
- Yes, that's what I meant to say.
- Come out when it's time to play the game.

188
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:47,850
Then I'll just go home and wait,
and you can call me when it's my turn.

189
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:49,540
You know what I'm trying to say here.

190
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:51,800
<i>Okay, the guests have arrived on scene.</i>

191
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,410
- We should get going then.
- You have to do a good job with this.

192
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:55,150
<i>We're going to start with our opening.</i>

193
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:57,330
<i>We're going to do the opening
without Lee Kwang Soo.</i>

194
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:59,870
Kwang Soo, if we're going to get these hints,
you have to make sure to do a good job.

195
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:01,660
[Lee Kwang Soo's Hide-and-Seek]

196
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:08,580
[His grudge over never having starred in
a drama will now be fulfilled here.]

197
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:12,890
[On the other hand]

198
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:17,540
[The guests have no clue that
Kwang Soo is watching from hiding.]

199
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:20,480
<i>We're going to start our first mission.</i>

200
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:26,670
[Heading inside the building to start
their first mission.]

201
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,830
[At last, Kwang Soo's
Hide-and-Seek starts!]

202
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:33,590
- This must be the game zone.
- What is this game zone?

203
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,920
- This is the game zone.
- What are we going to do here?

204
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:38,460
Are we going to be playing
some kind of a game in here?

205
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:40,090
<i>Welcome, everyone.</i>

206
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:43,950
<i>After we play a game on the first floor,
which is where you're all standing right now</i>

207
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:49,830
<i>we're going to move up to the second floor
to play the next round of games.</i>

208
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:53,250
<i>Your first mission is,
The Gold Medal Empire.</i>

209
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:54,550
- What's that?
- What is that?

210
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:57,320
<i>You're going to need props
to play all of these games.</i>

211
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,590
<i>For example, since we're all
on the first floor right now</i>

212
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:01,720
<i>the props that you'll need
to play the first game</i>

213
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:04,750
<i>are hidden throughout the first floor.</i>

214
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:09,640
<i>You can only go around on the first floor
to find the props that you'll be needing</i>

215
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:13,210
<i>and come back to the game zone where you're
currently standing to play the game.</i>

216
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:16,520
<i>To those that come in at first through
third place in each of these games</i>

217
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,390
<i>you will be given a gold medal.</i>

218
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:21,470
<i>Okay, we're going to start playing
the game on the first floor.</i>

219
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:22,810
<i>The first floor game is...</i>

220
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:25,050
<i>- Gonggi game.
- Ah, gonggi?</i>

221
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:26,570
Then I guess we need to go
find some gonggi.

222
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:28,300
[Wait...]

223
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:32,380
[How is Kwang Soo at gonggi?]

224
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:36,020
Ah, it's gonggi?

225
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:39,370
Where am I going to find
those tiny things?

226
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:43,900
I'm just going to have to rely on someone
else to find and bring them to me.

227
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:47,970
<i>Gonggi pieces are hidden throughout
the first floor.</i>

228
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:50,700
<i>The objective is for you to find them,
bring them to the zone and play the game.</i>

229
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:54,270
<i>You have to get through all five levels
of the game without making a single mistake.</i>

230
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:56,650
- Everyone must succeed to pass.
- Do we have to play with one hand?

231
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:58,870
<i>Of course, with one hand.
Gonggi is usually played with one hand.</i>

232
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:00,750
[Gonggi is usually played with one hand...]

233
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:02,730
No, you can't play it like that.

234
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,570
Okay, let's get started.

235
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:06,180
[Kwang Soo...]

236
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:08,110
[You have to do a good job...]

237
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:11,310
[Round One- First Floor Game.
Gonggi Game- Start!]

238
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:14,460
[Kwang Soo's game of hide-and-seek
also begins!]

239
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,840
[Right from the beginning,
rummaging through the garbage cans.]

240
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:23,620
Are all five pieces together?

241
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:26,250
Why aren't you saying anything?

242
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:32,500
Can't you just tell me if you know?
You're taking this game way too seriously.

243
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:36,120
So we just start searching without
anyone giving us a hint?

244
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:37,560
Without knowing anything?

245
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:43,110
I don't see any.

246
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:45,450
[Here they are...]

247
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:50,650
Where's Kwang Soo?

248
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:55,400
- We need to keep our eyes open.
- We need to find them as quickly as possible.

249
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:58,860
- Should we? Just find them first?
- You don't know where they're at, do you?

250
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:00,340
No, I have no idea where they're at.

251
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:02,240
He just has to stay in hiding.

252
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:05,490
[Kwang Soo, where are you?]

253
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:08,310
It's Dong Hoon!

254
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:13,670
I just heard something.

255
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:17,030
- Hey.
- Dong Hoon.

256
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:22,110
[Finally succeeds in their search for him.]

257
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:26,030
- You look so pitiful.
- Dong Hoon, do I look obvious?

258
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:28,540
I can totally tell it's you.

259
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:31,900
[Anyone can tell that it's Kwang Soo.]

260
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:34,430
We'll find the gonggi pieces
and get them to you, okay?

261
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:38,450
And you know those mannequins
that are dressed up in armor?

262
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:39,910
You should hide in there.

263
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,420
How can I hide in those?

264
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:49,780
[Do I look obvious?]

265
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,940
Where's Kwang Soo?

266
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,960
He needs to start making his moves.

267
00:13:55,970 --> 00:14:00,300
[Kwang Soo must pass the game of gonggi
before three other players beat the game!]

268
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:02,100
He's in there right now.

269
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:04,170
In there.
He's in that room over there.

270
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:07,120
[Ha Ha's alerting others of
Kwang Soo's hiding location.]

271
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:10,070
- Get the pieces to him if you find them.
- We need to find the pieces for him.

272
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:18,030
[Discovers the gonggi pieces!]

273
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:22,300
[He must now hurry and get
these pieces over to Kwang Soo!]

274
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:24,470
Did you find them?

275
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:25,550
- Did you find them?
- No, I didn't!

276
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:26,920
Did you find them?

277
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:31,470
Kwang Soo!

278
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:35,440
[Secretly passing the gonggi pieces
off to Kwang Soo!]

279
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,320
Is there anyone at
the game zone right now?

280
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:40,430
[Now's the chance!
The game zone is empty!]

281
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:41,620
Hurry!
Hurry up and do it!

282
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:44,040
[Must rush over to the game zone
to successfully pass the gonggi game!]

283
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,180
Hurry up and run!

284
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:47,840
Hurry, hurry!

285
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:51,180
[Rule: Even Kwang Soo must play
the game only the game zone.]

286
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:57,870
Don't you dare fail.

287
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,960
[Ha Ha keeping watch in case
any of the guests approach.]

288
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:06,120
Calm down, and relax.
There you go.

289
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,020
[Succeeds through the second level!]

290
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:10,040
Okay, you're doing good.

291
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:11,950
There you go.

292
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:14,240
[Succeeds the third level!]

293
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,280
There you go.

294
00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:17,600
[Ah...]

295
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:20,690
Hey, take it slow and do it calmly.

296
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:23,480
I feel like I'm the one
who's going to go crazy.

297
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:29,020
[Just then, Hyun Joo on his
search mission...]

298
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:34,210
[Hyun Joo discovers the set of
gonggi pieces!]

299
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:39,430
[Hyun Joo rushes off to the game zone!]

300
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:40,680
Dong Hoon, is anyone coming?

301
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:46,670
Come on!

302
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,040
Come on, please!

303
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:55,870
Ugh, hurry up and go back into hiding.

304
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:57,540
Over there.
Go over there.

305
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:59,240
Hey, Hyun Joo found the pieces!

306
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,820
Really?

307
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:06,510
[Hyun Joo arrives at the zone
by the split of a hair difference.]

308
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:08,080
- I just found some too.
- Really?

309
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,470
- You found them?
- Yes.

310
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:12,210
[A crowd is slowly starting to gather
at the game zone... what to do?]

311
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,880
[Kwang Soo goes back to hide
in the dressing room.]

312
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,490
I'm usually really good at gonggi.

313
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:18,710
I'm normally very good at the game.

314
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:22,710
[Giraffe disappointed at having
lost a good opportunity.]

315
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,950
Here's another person.

316
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:27,620
You found some too, Gary?
Three people need to succeed, right?

317
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:29,820
[If all three of the guests succeed,
then Kwang Soo's hide-and-seek is over!]

318
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:31,620
[We have to stop them!]

319
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:33,430
You have to go and find yours too.

320
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:36,420
- Aren't there only these three sets?
- No, there are more out there.

321
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:39,720
He's really good.

322
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,980
[Hyun Joo surprising them with
his unexpected gonggi skills.]

323
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:45,620
- That one is going to be a bit hard.
- You're really good.

324
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:53,080
Don't let them get to you.

325
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:56,710
[We have to stop them!]

326
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,510
[He's already at the fourth level!]

327
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:06,430
I'm sorry.
That was so close.

328
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:09,170
[Hyun Joo fails the game with
Suk Jin's interference.]

329
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:12,270
[What a relief...]

330
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:13,580
It's Gary's turn now.

331
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:15,300
- It's Gary's turn.
- Okay, Gary.

332
00:17:18,610 --> 00:17:21,090
[Failing on purpose to buy
some more time.]

333
00:17:24,090 --> 00:17:26,180
[Kwang Soo is inside that store
to the right.]

334
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:29,860
- Ugh, this game is hard.
- It is pretty hard.

335
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:33,200
[Blank Ji sneaking away to meet Kwang Soo
in order to come up with a plan.]

336
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:37,400
Kwang Soo.

337
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,360
- Do you have the gonggi pieces?
- I have the pieces.

338
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,920
- You have the pieces?
- I got up to the second level.

339
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,820
Who's up on the stage right now?
Who's over at the game zone?

340
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:46,440
They're all there.
Son Hyun Joo is over there right now.

341
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,790
What am I going to do?

342
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,010
Just wait here for now.

343
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:52,470
They're all over there right now,
and the members know that you're here.

344
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:54,260
I have to get back and finish this.

345
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,720
That looks like a lot of fun.

346
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:02,620
It's all over now.

347
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:05,140
[No!]

348
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:08,310
[Getting ready to interfere with the game
by moving the tablecloth with his foot.]

349
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:14,220
[Success!]

350
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,040
- What are you thinking?
- I'm so sorry, Hyun Joo.

351
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,090
[Hyun Joo starting over from
the fourth level.]

352
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,660
What are you doing?

353
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:34,710
[An obvious... sneeze interference.]

354
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:37,830
Sorry, but I suddenly had to sneeze.

355
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:42,120
What are you guys doing?

356
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,000
[Hyun Joo's gonggi pieces that
fell on the ground...]

357
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,210
[Ha Ha steals them and runs away!]

358
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:48,440
My... hey!
Hey!

359
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:51,920
[Now's the time!]

360
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:53,040
Toad!

361
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,670
Toad!

362
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:58,200
[Blank Ji calls Toad Kwang out of hiding.]

363
00:18:58,430 --> 00:19:01,430
[No one is at the game zone!
Now's another chance!]

364
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:05,280
[But Hyun Joo gets his gonggi pieces
back in the meantime and is heading back!]

365
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,970
Hyun Joo is going to try again.
Hey!

366
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:08,400
[Shock]

367
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,800
Hyun Joo is going to try it again!

368
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,190
Hey!

369
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:13,220
Hyun Joo is going to try it again!

370
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:16,420
[A split second late in his reaction,
and he would've been discovered!]

371
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:27,560
[Now what...]

372
00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:31,550
[The crowd has gathered
back up in the game zone.]

373
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:33,060
Gary's good.

374
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:34,820
He's very calm and serious about it.

375
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:36,250
The lighting is in my eye.

376
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:37,940
- I'm going to have to try it from here.
- He has a hard time with this level.

377
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:41,980
It's kind of hard because you keep
grabbing onto the tablecloth.

378
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:44,570
- I got up to the second level earlier.
- You're on the third level now, right?

379
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:46,680
Which level did you get up to, Hyun Joo?

380
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,800
- I almost got all the way though.
- Wow, he's almost all the way through.

381
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,290
He's at the final catch round.

382
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:52,940
[Why is he trying so hard to do well?]

383
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:54,170
He's going to ruin it at this last moment.

384
00:19:54,170 --> 00:19:55,200
[Gary passes through the fourth level.]

385
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,740
[What is he doing?]

386
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:57,970
You have to get at least three pieces.

387
00:19:57,970 --> 00:20:01,080
[Must get a minimum of three pieces
in this fifth level.]

388
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,780
[Huh? Gary passes the first
gonggi mission in first place!]

389
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:09,680
[What are you thinking passing the mission
even before Kwang Soo passes it?]

390
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:13,020
[Oops...]

391
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:15,750
[That idiot...]

392
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,790
Gary... good job.

393
00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:22,410
[Anyway, Gary passes in first place,
and therefore wins himself a gold medal.]

394
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:26,090
If two more people succeed

395
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:28,260
it's the end of this round,
and we'll move on to the next round.

396
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:30,190
[If two more people succeed,
the whole mission is over!]

397
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:31,700
Gary succeeded?

398
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:35,900
What is Gary thinking winning
the round like that?

399
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:42,590
[It's now gonggi master, Hyun Joo's turn.]

400
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:44,390
- No, I was told that it's okay.
- You can't do that?

401
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:46,210
- Don't talk to me.
- I don't think you're allowed to do that.

402
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:53,130
[If he keeps going at this rate,
he's going to succeed too.]

403
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:55,020
He's really good at this.

404
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:56,900
Do you have a lot of sisters
or something?

405
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:02,680
[Jae Suk 'kidnaps'
Hyun Joo's gonggi piece from midair?]

406
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:10,350
What is this?

407
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,370
Unless you go catch Jae Suk,
there's no way for you to win.

408
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:16,330
[He must get the gonggi piece that
Jae Suk stole, back in his hand.]

409
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:21,320
For example, if Ji Hyo was to take
this piece and run off with it?

410
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:22,770
No, you can't do that!

411
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:25,830
[Running Man members becoming
bold in their attempts at interference.]

412
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:27,480
Pass it to me, Ji Hyo!

413
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:32,920
[Kwang Soo seizes this moment to
approach the game zone.]

414
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:38,070
[Gary takes a piece of Jung Hee's gonggi,
and runs away!]

415
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:42,970
[Huh?
Wow... such a close call!]

416
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:45,970
Jae Suk.

417
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:50,020
I've always liked you, Jae Suk.

418
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:53,170
What were you thinking, beating
the game like that?

419
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:55,240
- What did you say?
- How could you succeed like that?

420
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:57,360
- I just got on a roll and forgot about it.
- Who cares if you were on a roll?

421
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,530
I just got swept up in the game
and totally forgot about it.

422
00:21:59,530 --> 00:22:02,070
- How nice it must be to have your gold medal.
- No, it's not like that.

423
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:03,470
Wow, look at her.

424
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:05,350
[They must get Mi Sun
far away from the game zone.]

425
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:06,990
Are you sure you have all five pieces?
Let me see.

426
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:10,750
[Jae Suk steals one of Mi Sun's
gonggi pieces and makes a run for it!]

427
00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:17,640
What do I do?
I'm not wearing running shoes!

428
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,700
[Now it's Mr. Capable who steals Hyun Joo's
gonggi pieces and makes off with them!]

429
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:33,530
- You have to hurry and get them back.
- You should hurry.

430
00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:35,240
[That's what you call desperation.]

431
00:22:39,870 --> 00:22:42,380
[A signal to let Kwang Soo know
that the game zone is empty!]

432
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:45,810
[Kwang Soo infiltrates the
game zone again!]

433
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,220
[Going under the table?]

434
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:56,510
[Level one complete.]

435
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:02,460
Please do it right!

436
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:06,870
Come on, and hurry!

437
00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:11,820
[Level two complete.]

438
00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:23,590
He doesn't even make a single mistake!
Look at him.

439
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:25,950
[All the guys are busying themselves
trying to distract Hyun Joo.]

440
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:29,930
- You have to get at least three.
- It's has to be at least three.

441
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:33,850
[Mi Sun and Jung Hee are almost
at the game zone!]

442
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:40,480
[Level three complete!]

443
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:42,670
Slow down.

444
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,630
[Level four complete.]

445
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:52,300
[Gets exactly three pieces
on top of his hand!]

446
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:53,670
It's totally over if you don't
catch them.

447
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:04,040
[Wow! Kwang Soo secretly passes
the first round of gonggi game!]

448
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:08,820
He did it.
He got it done, Jong Kook.

449
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:12,880
[But he must not get caught
for being under the table!]

450
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:16,690
[He'd better not even breathe...]

451
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:19,700
- You're really good.
- Fighting.

452
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:21,230
- Level two.
- You're really good at this.

453
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:23,770
I think level two is the hardest.

454
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:27,340
[Secretly sneaking a bottle of water in
to Kwang Soo for his job well done.]

455
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:31,450
He caught it, he caught it.

456
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,340
He's here.
Hyun Joo is here.

457
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:37,050
Why are you knocking me
out of the way?

458
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:42,670
Why are you trying to interfere
with my game?

459
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:45,870
But he may be able to succeed this time.

460
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:48,790
[I can't let them catch me under here!]

461
00:24:51,330 --> 00:24:52,750
- That's good.
- He's good at it.

462
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:55,990
[Suk Jin flying through the levels
now that he can play in comfort.]

463
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:02,920
[Running Man's Suk Jin easily passes
the round in second place!]

464
00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:06,250
[Suk Jin did it!]

465
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:08,330
- Why did you try to interfere?
- You already got through it anyway.

466
00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:12,940
[Suk Jin wins himself a gold medal for
coming in at second place in the first round.]

467
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:15,520
- But, Hyun Joo, didn't you do it earlier?
- You got it done earlier.

468
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:18,530
[Gonggi master Hyun Joo's serious turn.]

469
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,550
He's a master at this.

470
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:24,640
- I bet he did this a lot when he was little.
- I can't believe how good you are at this.

471
00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:27,120
[Passing through all four levels
in one try!]

472
00:25:27,890 --> 00:25:29,760
You have to catch them all
if you want to pass.

473
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:33,610
You have to catch them all.

474
00:25:34,430 --> 00:25:36,360
No one touch him right now.
Let's see if he can do it.

475
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:41,840
[Guest Hyun Joo completes the round
by coming in at third place.]

476
00:25:43,150 --> 00:25:45,160
- He's really good.
- He's very competitive.

477
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:47,530
[Completing it so easily without any
interference from other members.]

478
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:52,230
[Hyun Joo also wins himself a gold medal
for coming in at third place.]

479
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:54,170
Is this real gold?
Just this little portion?

480
00:25:54,670 --> 00:25:56,170
This part?
Seriously?

481
00:25:57,100 --> 00:26:00,110
[Running Man protecting the table that
Kwang Soo is hiding under to the end.]

482
00:26:00,450 --> 00:26:03,570
<i>Okay, the first mission,
gonggi game is now over.</i>

483
00:26:03,570 --> 00:26:06,950
<i>As I told you earlier, we will now head up
to the second level for your next mission.</i>

484
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:10,660
- Yes.
- You may now all go up to the next game zone.

485
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:12,930
- Let's go.
- I need to win myself a medal too.

486
00:26:12,930 --> 00:26:15,050
I'm usually pretty good at this game,
but I don't know what happened this time.

487
00:26:15,050 --> 00:26:16,190
Okay, let's go.

488
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,070
I'm going to play a practice round
to see how I do.

489
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:22,780
[These two remaining behind to protect
the table until everyone else is gone.]

490
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:26,380
- Hyun Joo.
- I want to try playing a round before I go.

491
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:29,260
No, I just came back to get you.

492
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:30,670
Let's go up to the second floor.

493
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:34,150
- Jong Kook.
- Yeah?

494
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:38,030
[Are they gone?]

495
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:51,700
Should I go now?

496
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:53,700
Is it okay for me to come out now?

497
00:26:58,060 --> 00:26:59,230
They're all gone.

498
00:27:01,910 --> 00:27:05,570
[The poor thing... having to dress
like that in this hot weather.]

499
00:27:06,370 --> 00:27:09,630
[Plan is to disguise himself as a
VJ with the camera in hand.]

500
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:14,240
[The missions are just going to keep
getting harder and harder.]

501
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:16,930
[Will his plan of keeping himself
disguised keep working?]

502
00:27:16,930 --> 00:27:20,890
Okay, the next game is, the jaeggi game.

503
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:22,850
[Round three- The jaeggi game.]

504
00:27:23,170 --> 00:27:25,110
- Jaeggi game?
- I'm good at this game.

505
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:28,110
Men and women alike have to
kick it five times.

506
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:29,280
- Okay.
- Five times?

507
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,780
- We just need to kick it five times?
- Five times.

508
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:34,310
- Then we have to go find them?
- You must go find them now. Go!

509
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:36,650
- Okay!
- Isn't this one?

510
00:27:36,650 --> 00:27:39,410
[On their way to find the hidden jaeggis
that are hidden throughout the third floor!]

511
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:43,270
You startled me.
What is it?

512
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:44,460
Oh, here's one!

513
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:47,370
[Ha Ha already discovers one?]

514
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:49,570
Sorry, I was lying.

515
00:27:49,570 --> 00:27:51,990
[Ha Ha's little tricks.]

516
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:54,000
I think you've been tricking me nonstop
for the past two hours now.

517
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:58,080
[Huh? Did he really find one this time?]

518
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:00,920
I'm sorry, Hyun Joo.

519
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:05,580
[Seriously...]

520
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,400
Why are you so easily tricked?

521
00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:10,390
I want you to go away.

522
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,920
[Succeeds in buying some time.]

523
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:17,820
[Gary is the first to discover a jaeggi!]

524
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:21,760
I found one.

525
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,010
Go give it to Kwang Soo.

526
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,000
How am I the star of this episode right now?

527
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:30,520
[Kwang Soo hears the calling sign
for him to come down to the game zone.]

528
00:28:39,410 --> 00:28:41,940
[The game zone is still empty!]

529
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:47,080
[Kwang Soo can pass this round if he can
kick it at least five times.]

530
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:49,750
- What are you doing?
- Hurry up and don't make any mistakes.

531
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,090
Hurry!

532
00:28:53,090 --> 00:28:55,530
[Is it really that hard?]

533
00:28:55,530 --> 00:28:56,650
- You have to worry.
- There's someone there.

534
00:28:56,650 --> 00:28:58,810
- No there isn't. It's just Suk Jin.
- Is that Hyun Joo?

535
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,910
Come on, please!
Get it right!

536
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:05,740
Set, go.

537
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:08,200
One, two, three.

538
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,550
[Three this time.]

539
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:13,380
One, two, three.

540
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:14,610
Come on!

541
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:21,220
You have to calm down.

542
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:23,410
[Ouch...]

543
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:27,750
One, two, three, four... one more!

544
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:33,230
[Four!
He just needs one more!]

545
00:29:35,890 --> 00:29:37,460
[Misses the kick.]

546
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:41,900
[Ah... to lose such a good and
easy opportunity as this one...]

547
00:29:42,670 --> 00:29:45,130
[On the other hand,
right around the same time...]

548
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:55,880
[Guest Hyun Joo discovers a jaeggi.]

549
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,770
[Now off to the game zone to
try his turn at jaeggi kicking!]

550
00:29:57,780 --> 00:29:59,020
Calm down and do it.

551
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:00,810
[This isn't the right time to
be doing this.]

552
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,920
- One, two, three...
- He's headed this way.

553
00:30:06,490 --> 00:30:08,680
- Can I rest for a bit?
- What do you mean, rest?

554
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:10,830
You have to try to finish this
while we've got the chance.

555
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:16,020
- I'm about to lose my mind.
- Hey, hey, hey!

556
00:30:16,050 --> 00:30:17,650
You have to run and hide!

557
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:19,540
[Danger!
Someone is headed their way!]

558
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:22,650
[Hyun Joo is heading in their direction
with the jaeggi that he's found!]

559
00:30:24,010 --> 00:30:25,860
[That could've been big trouble.]

560
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:27,710
- Are you finished?
- No, I'm still trying.

561
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:31,850
Okay.
One, two, three, four...

562
00:30:34,990 --> 00:30:36,710
Why did you push me, Dong Hoon?

563
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:38,720
[As soon as Hyun Joo got up to four,
Gary automatically interrupts the game.]

564
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:41,010
- You can't use both feet.
- No, you can't use both your feet.

565
00:30:41,010 --> 00:30:43,130
- You can only use one foot.
- Okay.

566
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:45,390
- You're not allowed to use both feet.
- Okay.

567
00:30:45,390 --> 00:30:47,640
How about I use both my feet,
but I'll do ten kicks?

568
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:49,000
- Ten kicks with both feet?
- Ten kicks.

569
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,500
Is there anything that you can't do?

570
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:53,020
Okay, Hyun Joo is going to kick ten
by using both his feet.

571
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:54,410
- Ten?
- Go.

572
00:30:54,410 --> 00:30:56,220
- We'll keep it simple.
- He's going to kick ten using both his feet.

573
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:59,140
[Everyone agrees to having Hyun Joon
kick ten with the use of both his feet.]

574
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,890
[Got up to eight!]

575
00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:08,670
Your turn.

576
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:14,900
You need to be more cautious.
You almost hit yourself.

577
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:16,590
If it wasn't for me,
you would've hit yourself in the nose.

578
00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:18,550
- You could've really hurt yourself.
- You have to try it again.

579
00:31:18,550 --> 00:31:20,340
You almost bruised yourself in the nose.

580
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:22,190
[So many different ways of interfering.]

581
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:24,430
- It's Gary's turn.
- Okay, Gary.

582
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:30,700
- You almost hit me with that thing.
- You almost really did.

583
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:32,450
- It could've been dangerous.
- That was dangerous.

584
00:31:32,990 --> 00:31:34,640
Do I just drop it like this?

585
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:38,260
- Oh my.
- See? I can't do it.

586
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:40,530
- If you've never done it.
- I've never done it, so I don't know how.

587
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:43,840
[Huh? He's right in front of them?]

588
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:47,970
- How am I going to do this?
- You can't do this?

589
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:50,600
[What do we do?]

590
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:56,580
- In that case... let's all take a break.
- Why don't we take a moment first?

591
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:58,930
[Proposing that everyone walk around once
and come back and do it in order of arrival.]

592
00:31:58,930 --> 00:32:00,900
Okay, how about we do it in
the order of arrival?

593
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:02,770
[Why do we have to
do that all of a sudden?]

594
00:32:04,370 --> 00:32:06,980
[The plan is to give Kwang Soo a chance
to try his turn while they walk around.]

595
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:08,650
Since running is too tiring,
how about speed walking?

596
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:10,460
Running would count as cheating.

597
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:12,250
- We have to walk like this.
- Speed walking?

598
00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:13,870
Ready, set, go.

599
00:32:13,870 --> 00:32:16,500
Okay, men have to walk on their heels.

600
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:19,120
[The guests giving it their all
without even knowing the reason for it.]

601
00:32:20,590 --> 00:32:22,780
[Running Man members are moving
at a much slower pace.]

602
00:32:23,450 --> 00:32:25,890
[Now is his chance!]

603
00:32:27,950 --> 00:32:29,260
Just do it now!

604
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:33,730
[He only needs to kick it five times...]

605
00:32:34,670 --> 00:32:37,160
- Make sure that no one comes.
- No one's coming, so hurry up!

606
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:41,330
- One, two, three, four..
- You have to concentrate.

607
00:32:46,410 --> 00:32:48,800
[On the other hand, Jung Hee's
proving herself to be quite fast!]

608
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:50,440
This is quite a distance.

609
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:53,420
Why is it so far?

610
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:56,510
My legs are going to give out on me.

611
00:32:57,490 --> 00:32:59,570
My legs are already so exhausted.

612
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:04,000
What's wrong with you?

613
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:08,100
Hey, Kwang Soo.
You're the star of this episode.

614
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:09,190
I'll throw it to you.

615
00:33:09,190 --> 00:33:11,530
One, two, three.

616
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,820
Hurry!

617
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:17,660
[Just then, Suk Jin yells out to
signal danger heading their way.]

618
00:33:18,610 --> 00:33:20,350
Come on, you can't run!

619
00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:22,250
- I'm not running.
- Yes, you're running!

620
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:25,010
- No, this is running.
- Yes, you're running right now.

621
00:33:25,010 --> 00:33:27,040
- Were you running?
- No, I wasn't running.

622
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:29,640
No, I wasn't running.
I was just speed walking.

623
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:33,590
No, all three of us are done.

624
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:35,560
- Really?
- Yes, all three places have been taken now.

625
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:38,360
[Huh? Did Jae Suk just succeed?]

626
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:41,130
I succeeded.
I just got my five.

627
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:42,920
[What's he doing?]

628
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:44,990
Really?

629
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:47,610
[Jae Suk wins the gold medal for coming in
at first place in the jaeggi game.]

630
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:51,070
[Sending the guests off again.]

631
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:53,570
[It's another chance for Kwang Soo!]

632
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:58,020
- Come on, hurry!
- What are you doing?

633
00:33:58,030 --> 00:34:00,400
[If he doesn't succeed this time,
he may lose his chance to succeed at all!]

634
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,520
Hurry up and just go.

635
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:03,390
[Sending everyone else away
so that they don't draw any suspicion.]

636
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,480
What is it that you're doing?

637
00:34:12,290 --> 00:34:14,390
[Can't seem to get past three.]

638
00:34:14,390 --> 00:34:15,540
Just go.

639
00:34:19,990 --> 00:34:21,750
Seriously... hurry up and do it.

640
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:28,400
[Oh? He may get it done this time?]

641
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:31,770
[He just needs one more!]

642
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:36,660
[Kwang Soo succeeds round three game
of jaeggi in secret!]

643
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,410
[No time to celebrate.
Back to disguising himself as the VJ!]

644
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:43,660
Okay, we did it.

645
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:49,200
[If Kwang Soo can pass the next game,
only the RM members will gain the clue!]

646
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:51,360
[Mr. Capable's turn!]

647
00:34:53,570 --> 00:34:55,940
[So easy! Succeeds in
getting five kicks in right away!]

648
00:34:58,610 --> 00:34:59,920
What the heck?

649
00:35:00,310 --> 00:35:03,110
[Kim Jong Kook comes in at second place and
wins himself a gold medal in Round Three.]

650
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:04,320
- Let's go.
- Okay, let's go.

651
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,550
[Round three of the jaeggi game
is now over.]

652
00:35:08,970 --> 00:35:12,180
[Jaeggi King Gary no longer pretending
to be bad at the game.]

653
00:35:12,730 --> 00:35:15,480
[It looks like he can keep it up all day.]

654
00:35:18,570 --> 00:35:21,640
[Kwang Soo has to secretly go on to
the next location for his final mission.]

655
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:33,250
This is too nerve-wrecking.

656
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:38,680
Don't they even find it suspicious to see
someone walking around dressed this way?

657
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:42,140
They don't find it strange when it's
so obvious that I'm wearing a disguise?

658
00:35:42,170 --> 00:35:45,630
I'm walking around dripping sweat, covered up
in a coat and a hat, but they don't notice?

659
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:48,060
[It's a relief that they don't suspect the VJ
who's walking around dripping sweat.]

660
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:57,080
I don't think I can do this anymore.

661
00:35:57,850 --> 00:35:59,200
This is too hard.

662
00:36:01,430 --> 00:36:03,940
You told me that I was going to be
the star of this episode.

663
00:36:06,450 --> 00:36:08,950
<i>This is your fourth and final game
for the gold medal.</i>

664
00:36:09,290 --> 00:36:11,150
<i>As you can see,
this is the limbo game.</i>

665
00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:15,460
<i>Even though it's a limbo game, there's
something that you still have to find.</i>

666
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:17,500
- What do we have to find now?
- This isn't your average limbo game.

667
00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:21,620
<i>There are various animal masks
that are hidden throughout this floor.</i>

668
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:25,620
<i>You can only make an attempt at the
limbo bar when you have the mask on.</i>

669
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:27,670
- Wow...
- But those masks are huge!

670
00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:30,820
It'll be big trouble if we find
the giraffe mask.

671
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:32,950
[Big trouble if the mask that they find
ends up being the giraffe mask.]

672
00:36:33,890 --> 00:36:37,380
[Kwang Soo also must have the mask on
before he attempts the limbo challenge.]

673
00:36:38,090 --> 00:36:40,640
But I can't use that as part of my disguise.

674
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:46,500
Unless you're a complete idiot,
what VJ films with a mask on?

675
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:49,860
How am I going to get this done?

676
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:51,580
I'm going to have to complete this quickly.

677
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:53,120
I need to do it before
the others find their masks.

678
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:55,860
[Making his way over to find
an animal mask.]

679
00:37:06,570 --> 00:37:09,420
[Kwang Soo discovers the giraffe mask!]

680
00:37:12,210 --> 00:37:14,670
How am I supposed to pass under
the limbo bar with this thing on?

681
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:18,770
[Of all the masks out there to find,
that's the one you find?]

682
00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:20,800
How am I supposed to do the limbo
with this thing on?

683
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:23,680
[He's tall enough as is to begin with,
but limbo with the mask?]

684
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:27,330
If the limbo bar is tall as this one...

685
00:37:28,570 --> 00:37:31,200
[Making his attempt with the clothes rack.]

686
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:33,420
This shouldn't be bad.

687
00:37:35,090 --> 00:37:37,170
[Oh!]

688
00:37:37,990 --> 00:37:39,750
I should be able to get it done
if it's this height.

689
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:47,410
[As expected, the giraffe mask is
making it practically impossible!]

690
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,250
[This isn't going to work!]

691
00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:54,040
[I'm going to have to
think of another solution.]

692
00:37:55,730 --> 00:37:58,550
[Hyun Joo on the search for a mask
in another store.]

693
00:38:00,310 --> 00:38:02,160
Isn't this one of them?
This is a mask too.

694
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:04,170
Isn't this a mask?

695
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:06,710
It is!

696
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,260
I found one right away.

697
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:14,580
Look, I found one right away.

698
00:38:14,650 --> 00:38:15,830
[Hyun Joo is first to arrive.]

699
00:38:15,830 --> 00:38:18,540
[He just needs to pass under
the limbo bar with his mask on!]

700
00:38:19,810 --> 00:38:23,550
[His first time wearing an animal mask...]

701
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:24,970
You have to do a good job, okay?

702
00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:27,450
[Hanging the strap on his nose?]

703
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:29,980
What is he doing?

704
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:35,120
[Unable to make it through and crashes.]

705
00:38:38,470 --> 00:38:40,650
[Mi Sun making her attempt with
a rat mask on her head.]

706
00:38:42,330 --> 00:38:44,310
[Oh? It looks as though she may
pull it off!]

707
00:38:44,310 --> 00:38:45,660
You're going to make it!

708
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:47,150
[No!]

709
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:48,690
You got it!

710
00:38:50,910 --> 00:38:53,550
[I'm sorry, Mi Sun.]

711
00:38:53,550 --> 00:38:55,710
- Aren't you pretty athletic?
- I don't think that's going to matter at all.

712
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:58,650
[Moon Jung Hee, known for her dance skills
is taking her turn with the dog mask on.]

713
00:38:58,650 --> 00:39:00,670
- Oh my...
- See? Look at her.

714
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:06,180
[Fails from Jae Suk's quiet interference.]

715
00:39:07,310 --> 00:39:09,280
Wow... you're very flexible.

716
00:39:10,370 --> 00:39:14,220
[Kwang Soo making his way to the game zone
with the mask on his head.]

717
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:18,850
He looks like his mask.

718
00:39:18,850 --> 00:39:20,340
[Jae Suk takes his turn with
a rabbit mask on.]

719
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:21,880
This is the way you approach the bar.

720
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:23,570
You have to spread your legs apart a bit.

721
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:28,530
[Hm... backs up again.]

722
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:32,830
[If he thinks that he won't make it,
he backs up a few steps again.]

723
00:39:33,690 --> 00:39:38,690
[Finally making his appearance is...
Horse Beckham Ji.]

724
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:40,760
He looks a little like Beckham.

725
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:46,100
[It looks rather good on you.]

726
00:39:47,970 --> 00:39:52,400
[Hyun Joo takes his turn after having
picked up Jae Suk's method.]

727
00:39:52,410 --> 00:39:54,240
There you go.
You're doing pretty well with that.

728
00:39:55,950 --> 00:39:58,480
[Also learned the trick of backing up
when things aren't looking very good.]

729
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:04,260
You learned that skill fast.

730
00:40:05,390 --> 00:40:09,500
[And if it seems that he still can't do it...
time to back it up.]

731
00:40:09,830 --> 00:40:11,700
Nice.
That's nice Hyun Joo.

732
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:14,110
[Lowering his stance to give it
another try.]

733
00:40:15,350 --> 00:40:17,870
[Leaning to the side a little bit
and reproaching the bar.]

734
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:23,610
- Okay, this is hard.
- Who's next?

735
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:28,670
[The fact that he can hide himself behind a
piece of cardboard is fascinating in itself.]

736
00:40:28,670 --> 00:40:29,740
Ji Hyo!

737
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:33,090
What do I do?

738
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:36,390
Where did you find that giraffe mask?
You can't wear that.

739
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,110
[Scolding him as soon as
she sees the giraffe mask.]

740
00:40:38,110 --> 00:40:39,620
This one doesn't even have a chin.

741
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:43,120
- But if I'm not going to win anyways.
- Hurry up and take it off.

742
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:45,770
I'm going to do this one.
I'm the Giraffe!

743
00:40:46,350 --> 00:40:49,060
We have to succeed this mission
in any way that we can!

744
00:40:49,070 --> 00:40:51,130
Hurry up and put that on.

745
00:40:51,130 --> 00:40:53,390
- I don't like the impala mask.
- Just hurry up and put it on!

746
00:40:53,770 --> 00:40:57,140
I'll just get really close to the zone,
and get in there and do it.

747
00:40:58,490 --> 00:41:02,380
[Suggesting that he barges in to just do it
before they realize that it's Kwang Soo?]

748
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:05,090
Then I'll pretend to be one of the VJ's
and go near the zone.

749
00:41:05,090 --> 00:41:06,820
Yeah, I think that would be better.

750
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:10,170
[Hyun Joo is still in the midst
of making his attempt.]

751
00:41:10,910 --> 00:41:13,040
That's like his basic move now.
That's the best.

752
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:15,080
That's the best position to take for this.

753
00:41:16,650 --> 00:41:18,310
He's really good at everything.

754
00:41:21,210 --> 00:41:23,070
[Gary's sly interference.]

755
00:41:24,010 --> 00:41:25,820
[Flexible Jung Hee's turn.]

756
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:28,230
- You got it.
- You're there, and you got it.

757
00:41:28,230 --> 00:41:30,550
- You got it!
- You did it!

758
00:41:30,550 --> 00:41:31,910
[Oh? Success!]

759
00:41:36,890 --> 00:41:40,270
- The gold medal that you wanted so badly.
- Thank you.

760
00:41:42,510 --> 00:41:45,320
Look at Hyun Joo practicing by himself
in the corner over there.

761
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,790
Why does this look so low?

762
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:51,690
I don't know if I can do this.
My legs are exhausted.

763
00:41:51,690 --> 00:41:53,380
I would think that you'd be good at it.

764
00:41:58,300 --> 00:42:00,600
[Mi Sun easily succeeds the mission!]

765
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:04,330
[Now... only one more...]

766
00:42:04,330 --> 00:42:07,280
[Mi Sun wins the gold medal for coming in
at second place in the last game.]

767
00:42:09,590 --> 00:42:12,870
[No more time!
Must hurry before someone else succeeds!]

768
00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:19,440
[Hyun Joo makes another attempt
with fierce determination.]

769
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,800
But your position...

770
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:23,390
Don't stick out
your lower body too much.

771
00:42:23,390 --> 00:42:25,890
Bend your head back.
Hyun Joo, you have to bend your head back.

772
00:42:25,890 --> 00:42:27,600
Bend it back as much as you can.

773
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:29,100
[Like this?]

774
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:33,200
That's right.
Now tilt your head to the side a bit.

775
00:42:36,770 --> 00:42:40,210
- This really isn't as easy as it looks.
- Did you see the way he was shaking?

776
00:42:40,210 --> 00:42:42,230
- Why don't you try it?
- I'll pull it up 5cm.

777
00:42:42,230 --> 00:42:44,290
[Everyone agreeing to lift up the
bar by 5cm.]

778
00:42:44,290 --> 00:42:46,470
- Then I'd be able to do that.
- That's not going to be very hard.

779
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:49,810
[If Hyun Joo succeeds this attempt,
then Kwang Soo's hide-and-seek is over.]

780
00:42:51,290 --> 00:42:52,920
Tilt your head to the side.

781
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:54,540
[Will he be able to do it this time?]

782
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:02,150
[Kwang Soo finally makes his way
near the game zone.]

783
00:43:03,050 --> 00:43:05,470
If you're not playing anymore,
can you step off to the side?

784
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:08,320
[Silently staying hidden.]

785
00:43:09,580 --> 00:43:12,020
[What do we do now?]

786
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:14,160
Can my VJ do it for me instead?

787
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:18,360
- My VJ is the best at this.
- Yeah, he really is good at this.

788
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:20,200
Can we get someone else to do it?
Hey, come over here.

789
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:23,160
[Running Man members trying to get Kwang Soo
who's disguised as a VJ to give it a try.]

790
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:25,040
Why don't you try it?
Let's have him give it a try.

791
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:28,070
You know that tall VJ?
Why don't we try to get him to do it?

792
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:31,480
- Soo Chul is really flexible.
- No, I want Ki Jin to try it first.

793
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:32,750
[Soo Chul?]

794
00:43:33,150 --> 00:43:35,370
[VJ Kwang Soo Chul...]

795
00:43:36,870 --> 00:43:40,540
[VJ Ki Jin to go first as their guinea pig.]

796
00:43:40,550 --> 00:43:42,330
Is that your own VJ?

797
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:50,790
[Now that everyone is into the game...
calling VJ Soo Chul to the front line!]

798
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:55,620
[Attempting to hide the face of VJ Soo Chul
by putting on a mask over his face.]

799
00:43:55,620 --> 00:43:57,980
- Come here, let him try.
- Why don't we have Soo Chul try it?

800
00:43:57,980 --> 00:43:59,260
[Curious...]

801
00:43:59,260 --> 00:44:02,070
I heard that he used to be really good at
sports while he was still in school.

802
00:44:02,070 --> 00:44:04,110
[He hasn't been caught yet.]

803
00:44:05,140 --> 00:44:06,350
- Give it another try.
- Try it again.

804
00:44:07,030 --> 00:44:09,240
Didn't you tell us that you used to
play quite a few sports in school?

805
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:11,770
[Turning his face away from others
so that his face can't be recognized.]

806
00:44:13,620 --> 00:44:15,800
Hey! I thought that
you said you played sports.

807
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:17,770
[The guests still unaware of
VJ Soo Chul's real identity.]

808
00:44:20,670 --> 00:44:23,100
[As Jung Hee makes her way over
so that she can see his face...]

809
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:25,950
[Jae Suk attempts to keep
Kwang Soo's face hidden.]

810
00:44:25,950 --> 00:44:27,940
- Hang on, wait a minute.
- Give it another try.

811
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:30,130
Here, you really have to get down.
Why don't you try this?

812
00:44:30,140 --> 00:44:32,060
[Attempting to hide his bashful face
so that people can't know who he is.]

813
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:33,830
Soo Chul, why don't you give it a try?

814
00:44:37,730 --> 00:44:39,820
[My knees!]

815
00:44:40,570 --> 00:44:42,030
[This guy is funny.]

816
00:44:42,620 --> 00:44:44,810
[VJ Soo Chul unable to even lift up
his head out of embarrassment.]

817
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:47,790
- Come on.
- Let's hurry up and do it.

818
00:44:51,210 --> 00:44:53,950
[Fails for going under the bar
during a fall.]

819
00:44:54,590 --> 00:44:57,110
[Do you think that man is okay?]

820
00:44:59,190 --> 00:45:01,860
[He could be caught if he tries to
drag this out any further!]

821
00:45:02,420 --> 00:45:05,420
Why don't you just show us how it's done?
Come on!

822
00:45:09,930 --> 00:45:13,240
[Nice and easy... sliding.]

823
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:18,140
[Because he fell down,
it's another fail!]

824
00:45:18,140 --> 00:45:20,020
Let's count that as a success!

825
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:24,440
That should count as a success.

826
00:45:25,130 --> 00:45:28,920
- This should count as a success!
- Soo Chul! Soo Chul!

827
00:45:30,250 --> 00:45:32,830
[Even the guests are joining in
on the cheer.]

828
00:45:32,830 --> 00:45:35,030
Soo Chul!

829
00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:37,950
[Don't do that!]

830
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:40,680
I told you not to do things like that.

831
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:42,980
[VJ Soo Chul trying to take his
jacket off from being too hot.]

832
00:45:42,980 --> 00:45:44,720
Soo Chul, no.
Don't take that off.

833
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:47,660
Get your head on straight.
No, you can't take that off.

834
00:45:47,660 --> 00:45:49,080
Soo Chul!

835
00:45:49,090 --> 00:45:51,100
Look at all that sweat.

836
00:45:53,710 --> 00:45:55,690
Come on, Soo Chul.
We got the point.

837
00:45:55,690 --> 00:45:57,540
Ready.
Soo Chul... go!

838
00:45:58,950 --> 00:46:00,540
Put your leg towards the middle.

839
00:46:00,540 --> 00:46:03,200
- How about you take your shoes off?
- There you go!

840
00:46:03,870 --> 00:46:06,640
[Taking off his shoes!]

841
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:11,740
- There you go, Soo Chul! You got it!
- Soo Chul! Soo Chul!

842
00:46:13,810 --> 00:46:15,910
[Lowering his stance!]

843
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:22,810
[Just a little bit more!]

844
00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:33,660
[He did it!]

845
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:38,070
[VJ Soo Chul does it!]

846
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,300
- He did it with his shoes off.
- Taking his shoes off helped.

847
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:43,140
He did it, right?

848
00:46:43,140 --> 00:46:45,530
He's Ki Jin's rival.

849
00:46:47,820 --> 00:46:50,700
[Back to his position as a VJ
with a gold medal around his neck.]

850
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:52,260
- You have to take the camera back.
- Take the camera.

851
00:46:52,270 --> 00:46:54,370
- Soo Chul.
- Hurry up and get going.

852
00:46:54,370 --> 00:46:55,950
[Depleted of all energy.]

853
00:46:55,950 --> 00:46:58,510
- You have to get back to filming us.
- Get back to your position.

854
00:46:59,250 --> 00:47:00,820
- Say thank you.
- Say your thanks and get out.

855
00:47:00,820 --> 00:47:02,780
- Say thank you.
- Thank everyone.

856
00:47:11,340 --> 00:47:12,910
Hey, Kwang Soo!

857
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:17,250
[Finally realizes that it's Kwang Soo!]

858
00:47:18,690 --> 00:47:21,900
- You really didn't know?
- So you really didn't know?

859
00:47:21,940 --> 00:47:24,780
You didn't recognize him as he was out
here the whole time as Soo Chul?

860
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:27,800
- This is Soo Chul!
- We've just been calling him Soo Chul.

861
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:30,820
Actually, the true mission
for the day...

862
00:47:30,820 --> 00:47:32,760
was Kwang Soo's Hide-and-Seek.

863
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:35,470
- It was Kwang Soo's Hide-and-Seek.
- Seriously?

864
00:47:35,470 --> 00:47:37,150
Remember when we were
playing gonggi earlier?

865
00:47:37,150 --> 00:47:39,500
- He was under the table the whole time.
- Oh my goodness.

866
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:42,670
[All the pieces of the puzzle
are finally starting to fall into place.]

867
00:47:42,670 --> 00:47:45,150
Kwang Soo had to do everything that we did
without any of you finding out about it.

868
00:47:45,150 --> 00:47:49,430
Kwang Soo had to do all the missions that
we did without the three of you finding out.

869
00:47:49,430 --> 00:47:52,610
So that's why we've been working all day
to interfere in your attempts.

870
00:47:52,610 --> 00:47:55,920
[Everyone did seem to be acting
a little strange...]

871
00:47:56,790 --> 00:47:58,480
We were thinking that you were
acting very strange.

872
00:48:01,780 --> 00:48:04,590
[Cannot get rid of the rage bubbling
inside of him over being deceived.]

873
00:48:04,590 --> 00:48:06,070
- You didn't know?
- You really didn't know?

874
00:48:06,070 --> 00:48:10,730
<i>If you said, 'Kwang Soo', 'Hey, Kwang Soo',
or 'What are you doing, Kwang Soo?'...</i>

875
00:48:11,020 --> 00:48:13,880
<i>If you had said anything that indicated
that you recognized him</i>

876
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:15,670
<i>then it would've been the
guests' victory.</i>

877
00:48:15,670 --> 00:48:17,440
<i>However, since that didn't happen</i>

878
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:22,790
<i>Running Man members succeeded in helping
Kwang Soo succeed all his missions in secret.</i>

879
00:48:23,130 --> 00:48:25,940
<i>You participated under the condition that
you'll gain the hint if you succeeded.</i>

880
00:48:25,940 --> 00:48:31,080
<i>Thus, all the members along with Kwang Soo
succeeded this mission.</i>

881
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:37,580
<i>Today's race is,
Numbered Hide-and-Seek.</i>

882
00:48:37,940 --> 00:48:39,970
<i>This will be an individual race to the end.</i>

883
00:48:40,190 --> 00:48:45,700
<i>And the winners of each mission will be given
hints about the numbers on the backs.</i>

884
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:47,300
[Numbered Hide-and-Seek]

885
00:48:47,540 --> 00:48:49,860
<i>As I mentioned to you earlier,
you'll now be given your hint.</i>

886
00:48:50,150 --> 00:48:52,440
<i>As I said, this isn't a team effort today.</i>

887
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:54,230
<i>But this is going to be an
individual race.</i>

888
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:56,300
<i>So all of the hints will be different
from each other.</i>

889
00:48:56,740 --> 00:48:58,730
<i>So it may be to your disadvantage
to share your hints.</i>

890
00:48:58,730 --> 00:49:02,000
<i>Okay, each of the Running Man members
can each take a hint.</i>

891
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,610
[Everyone receiving hint with
the exception of the three guests.]

892
00:49:03,610 --> 00:49:07,670
Even though I feel bad for Hyun Joo,
Min Sun, and Jung Hee...

893
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:11,470
<i>Okay, you may now change into your uniforms
and we'll move on to the next location.</i>

894
00:49:11,470 --> 00:49:17,440
[And thus... Kwang Soo's Hide-and-Seek
comes to a grand close.]

895
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:22,950
[Off to the next mission location!]

896
00:49:22,950 --> 00:49:24,800
I was told what to do.

897
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:29,830
If Kim Jong Kook mentions tiger,
then I was to mention a rabbit.

898
00:49:29,830 --> 00:49:31,390
Wow, that's pretty nice.

899
00:49:31,390 --> 00:49:32,750
[Her kids requested for her to do
the infamous 'cross' chant.]

900
00:49:32,750 --> 00:49:33,940
- Then do it.
- Tiger!

901
00:49:33,940 --> 00:49:35,880
- Rabbit!
- Cross!

902
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:38,150
That's pretty good.

903
00:49:38,420 --> 00:49:41,030
If you don't mind, I'm going to take
a quick peek at my hint.

904
00:49:41,030 --> 00:49:42,660
Okay, but I'd like to...

905
00:49:42,670 --> 00:49:46,730
<i>[Numbers 8, 9, 10 are Running Man members,
and each of them has one offspring.]</i>

906
00:49:46,730 --> 00:49:49,540
Wow.
You know this is a little...

907
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:53,690
<i>[Numbers 1 and 9 use a stage name.]</i>

908
00:49:53,690 --> 00:49:56,180
- But this is still...
- This is unbelievable.

909
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:59,100
- Really?
- This is a very conclusive hint.

910
00:49:59,100 --> 00:50:01,900
- Don't you think?
- This really is conclusive.

911
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:04,900
What do you think our hints are?

912
00:50:05,410 --> 00:50:08,030
- Since this is an individual race...
- I can't look at it, right?

913
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:09,330
[Since it's an individual race,
to share the information is a bit...]

914
00:50:09,330 --> 00:50:11,340
- I wonder what mine says?
- Does it relate to anything?

915
00:50:11,350 --> 00:50:13,150
Just tell me what it relates to.

916
00:50:13,150 --> 00:50:16,130
<i>[Numbers 1, 2, and 9 are singers,
and numbers 8, and 10 are comedians.]</i>

917
00:50:16,130 --> 00:50:18,900
- Do you think you get it?
- I see what this is.

918
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:22,270
<i>[Numbers 1 and 3 have something
to do with Mondays.]</i>

919
00:50:22,270 --> 00:50:25,320
There's numbers in my hint too.
There are some numbers.

920
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:29,250
So you have to figure it out from
those hints, and deduce a guess

921
00:50:29,250 --> 00:50:33,310
and the person to figure out who those
numbers belong to is the ultimate winner?

922
00:50:33,310 --> 00:50:35,950
I'm not quite sure about how it'll
all end, but I think the numbers...

923
00:50:35,950 --> 00:50:37,340
It sounds like you're trying to
get us to tell you something.

924
00:50:37,340 --> 00:50:39,270
Like what our hints are.

925
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:45,650
We haven't seen our hints yet,
so we don't know what they are either.

926
00:50:47,650 --> 00:50:49,180
Should we take a quick peek?

927
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:54,580
<i>[Numbers 1 and 2 are unmarried.]</i>

928
00:50:54,580 --> 00:50:56,310
My hint is amazing.

929
00:50:56,310 --> 00:50:59,940
<i>[Numbers 4 and 5 are in a drama that is
currently airing on Mondays and Tuesdays.]</i>

930
00:51:01,370 --> 00:51:06,050
I know that it can't be easy for you to come
on our show while currently in a drama.

931
00:51:06,050 --> 00:51:08,590
- No, I've always wanted to come on this show.
- Really?

932
00:51:09,180 --> 00:51:11,400
My son really loves the show.

933
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:12,860
What's his name?

934
00:51:12,860 --> 00:51:14,590
- Son Hyung Suk.
- Hyung Suk?

935
00:51:14,590 --> 00:51:17,750
Hyung Suk, at the rate things are going,
I don't know if your father will win.

936
00:51:17,750 --> 00:51:20,480
I don't know what'll happen in the second half
but I want you to keep watching, okay?

937
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:22,860
- You have to cheer him on.
- Yes, you have to cheer your dad on.

938
00:51:22,860 --> 00:51:25,850
- Will this get on air?
- Of course, it will.

939
00:51:26,620 --> 00:51:28,360
Hyung Suk.

940
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:30,540
Dad will do his best on Running Man
and come home, okay?

941
00:51:30,780 --> 00:51:32,900
My pretty daughter, keep watching, okay?

942
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:38,700
Your father doesn't have a very good chance
of winning at the moment.

943
00:51:38,700 --> 00:51:40,770
But you still have to support your dad, okay?

944
00:51:40,770 --> 00:51:43,610
- You have to keep cheering him on.
- I want you to keep watching too, honey.

945
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:48,360
I won a gold medal earlier.

946
00:51:51,250 --> 00:51:53,470
<i>[Incheon Park]</i>

947
00:51:53,470 --> 00:51:55,130
It's the acupuncture mat again.

948
00:51:55,140 --> 00:51:57,640
- We used to play this when we were little.
- I see what it is.

949
00:51:57,640 --> 00:51:58,910
[Wait, this is?]

950
00:51:58,910 --> 00:52:04,000
[A hop scotch game made entirely
out of the acupuncture mat.]

951
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,760
I'm really good at this.

952
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,110
- Wait, I think I know this.
- Isn't this a game of pool?

953
00:52:08,150 --> 00:52:11,190
[No! It's the traditional kid's game
of hop scotch.]

954
00:52:11,190 --> 00:52:13,560
- This is hop scotch.
- What are you talking about, Kwang Soo?

955
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:16,770
- I think I know this game.
- This looks more painful than usual.

956
00:52:16,770 --> 00:52:20,140
- This one is even more pointy.
- Don't you think this is too much?

957
00:52:20,750 --> 00:52:22,790
[Upgraded acupuncture mat!]

958
00:52:22,790 --> 00:52:27,880
<i>[Pick a number to throw a stone on and
all the members must get through to win.]</i>

959
00:52:28,030 --> 00:52:29,980
- What's the time limit?
- It's 30 seconds.

960
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:33,370
If there are four people in your team,
then only three of them can participate.

961
00:52:33,370 --> 00:52:34,460
Yes, I understand.

962
00:52:34,460 --> 00:52:36,080
Can we wear socks or no?

963
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:38,700
No, take off your socks.
Anyone participating has to take them off.

964
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:40,850
- Fine, take off the socks.
- Yes, take off the socks.

965
00:52:40,850 --> 00:52:42,660
- Let's see who can handle this.
- Take off the socks.

966
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:45,360
Let's all take them off and see how we do.

967
00:52:45,370 --> 00:52:47,940
- Wow, they're serious.
- Fine, let's just see who handles it better.

968
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:52,210
[Merciless first experience with
a variety show.]

969
00:52:52,210 --> 00:52:54,600
- We're not ruthless, Hyun Joo.
- No, we're not like that.

970
00:52:56,410 --> 00:52:58,260
Wow, this is...
This really is something else.

971
00:52:58,260 --> 00:53:01,490
[The power of the acupuncture mat.]

972
00:53:05,670 --> 00:53:06,970
This is a whole different level of pain.

973
00:53:06,970 --> 00:53:10,140
If I were to describe how it feels,
it feels like your feet will be bruised.

974
00:53:10,140 --> 00:53:12,460
Let us just feel it on our own.

975
00:53:12,990 --> 00:53:14,600
- What did you say?
- What did you say?

976
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:16,460
I'm just trying to let them know
what this is going to feel like.

977
00:53:16,460 --> 00:53:19,130
I'm going to feel it myself soon enough,
so why are you telling me?

978
00:53:19,130 --> 00:53:21,450
- I'm just trying to help them out.
- Seriously.

979
00:53:21,460 --> 00:53:23,200
Why are you so argumentative?

980
00:53:24,150 --> 00:53:26,210
Why are you only yelling at me?

981
00:53:26,210 --> 00:53:28,810
- Hyun Joo is on our team.
- You're on the same team?

982
00:53:28,820 --> 00:53:31,200
- He's a little weird too.
- How is he weird?

983
00:53:31,770 --> 00:53:33,810
Since our team was the first to arrive,
can we go first?

984
00:53:33,810 --> 00:53:37,040
- Okay, go ahead.
- Hyun Joo, pick one.

985
00:53:37,070 --> 00:53:38,240
[Blue Team to start them off.]

986
00:53:38,270 --> 00:53:40,660
- Jumping on this is going to hurt.
- Number six would be best.

987
00:53:41,860 --> 00:53:43,280
Number one!

988
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:45,030
[Number one.]

[Son Hyun Joo, Jae Suk and Ji Hyo
to participate first from the Blue Team.]

990
00:53:49,180 --> 00:53:50,930
This is the part that we should step on.

991
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:53,670
I'm sorry, but can you
take your foot off the mat?

992
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:56,320
- What did you say?
- Can you take your foot off the mat?

993
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:57,990
What are you talking about?

994
00:53:57,990 --> 00:53:59,740
He's the head of this clan.

995
00:54:02,300 --> 00:54:05,150
[Will it be possible for all three people to
make it through within 30 seconds?]

996
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:06,540
Okay, why don't you go first?

997
00:54:06,540 --> 00:54:09,030
[Blue Team's first participant-
Charismatic Son Hyun Joo.]

998
00:54:09,940 --> 00:54:13,410
[Son Hyun Joo, the god of acting.]

999
00:54:15,140 --> 00:54:19,130
[This terrifying acupuncture mat...]

1000
00:54:22,950 --> 00:54:25,140
[Screaming bloody murder.]

1001
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:32,510
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing, Hyun Joo?

1002
00:54:32,510 --> 00:54:35,220
[His charisma crumbles to pieces
on top of the acupuncture mat.]

1003
00:54:36,650 --> 00:54:39,580
[This is embarrassing.]

1004
00:54:41,870 --> 00:54:44,620
- What are you doing?
- This isn't that hard.

1005
00:54:45,620 --> 00:54:47,420
That's not how you do it!

1006
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:52,420
- You have to jump on both feet.
- Okay, he made it through.

1007
00:54:52,770 --> 00:54:55,900
[Hyun Joo unknowingly entertaining
others with his physical gags.]

1008
00:54:56,810 --> 00:55:00,150
- At the rate that she's going...
- You have to jump on both feet.

1009
00:55:00,780 --> 00:55:02,260
Have you never played this before?

1010
00:55:02,260 --> 00:55:04,550
- Hey! You give it a try!
- You can't step on the lines.

1011
00:55:05,350 --> 00:55:07,320
- On both feet!
- It's okay, Ji Hyo.

1012
00:55:09,330 --> 00:55:12,000
Seriously...
what's so difficult about this?

1013
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:15,170
What's so difficult about this thing?

1014
00:55:15,170 --> 00:55:17,340
[Why can't you do it better?]

1015
00:55:17,340 --> 00:55:19,040
What is he doing?

1016
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:21,850
Wow! That is no joke!
I feel like my feet are on fire!

1017
00:55:21,850 --> 00:55:24,380
Ugh, it's so hot!
Why is it so hot on this thing!

1018
00:55:24,380 --> 00:55:26,150
[Once he's gotten through the acupuncture mat,
he steps on the blue sun-baked mat.]

1019
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:28,610
- Hurry up and get back!
- This is so hot!

1020

[The power of the acupuncture mat
making them scream out in agony.]

1021
00:55:36,610 --> 00:55:38,450
That really hurts.
I don't know how we can do that.

1022
00:55:38,860 --> 00:55:41,490
[Blue Team- Fail.]

1023
00:55:41,490 --> 00:55:43,730
[Red Team's turn.]

1024
00:55:44,130 --> 00:55:46,770
- Wow, that's really painful.
- This looks like a liver.

1025
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:48,570
It looks like a liver.

1026
00:55:48,570 --> 00:55:52,250
- Why don't you pick it? Pick a good one.
- I don't know if I should be picking it.

1027
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:55,310
- I'm not good at things like this.
- You should've chosen with more care.

1028
00:55:56,100 --> 00:55:57,400
- Number four.
- Number four.

1029
00:55:57,820 --> 00:56:00,170
Whatever it is that you're imagining,
it's so much more than that.

1030
00:56:04,250 --> 00:56:06,480
[She did a good job throwing the liver!]

1031
00:56:10,780 --> 00:56:14,390
[Acupuncture mat is the worst
nightmare come to life for your senses.]

1032

[She's doing great.]

1034
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:24,330
You're doing great.

1035
00:56:24,330 --> 00:56:27,030
- You won't be able to pick it up.
- You have to pick it up from space five.

1036
00:56:30,310 --> 00:56:31,870
You have to do it on one foot.

1037

[Determined Mi Sun.]

1038
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:40,000
- She's like Moon Geun Young in her 40's.
- She's really good.

- You did really well.
- My feet are killing me.

1041

- This mat...
- Doesn't it hurt?

[First time playing this game in 30 years.]

1043
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:54,130
- You have to run around now.
- Jump on both feet.

1044
00:56:55,250 --> 00:56:56,760
You have to jump on one foot now.

1045
00:56:56,760 --> 00:57:00,260
One foot. You have to do it on one foot.
You can't walk like that.

1046
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:04,430
Back up and start off again
with your right foot.

1047
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:07,840
- Like this?
- That's right.

- This really hurts.
- Let's do this right.

1050

- How are we going to do this?
- This time, it's Gary, Ji Hyo and Hyun Joo.

1051

- That looks really painful.
- Pick a number, Hyun Joo.

1052
00:57:27,950 --> 00:57:29,290
I'll pick one for you.

1053
00:57:29,290 --> 00:57:30,710
I hope it's number six.

1054
00:57:30,710 --> 00:57:32,160
Number four.

1055
00:57:34,220 --> 00:57:35,660
- Ji Hyo can go first.
- Fighting.

1056
00:57:35,660 --> 00:57:36,880

Is it number four?

1060
00:57:50,290 --> 00:57:52,350
- There you go.
- Go!

1061
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:56,310
[Must get to these three spots
only on one foot.]

1062

- What's IC?
- Were you just swearing, Ji Hyo?

1063
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:07,810
[Reverting to her brutish Ji Hyo ways with
the wave of pain from the mat.]

1064
00:58:07,810 --> 00:58:10,450
- Don't get angry.
- I'm sorry.

1065
00:58:11,010 --> 00:58:13,690
- I told you that Ji Hyo used to play around.
- It's too late for an apology now.

1066
00:58:16,140 --> 00:58:19,520
[Passing it off to Hyun Joo for his turn.]

1067
00:58:22,990 --> 00:58:25,580
[Going without any hesitation.]

[Moving around naturally as if
he's playing the game on a flat surface.]

in nine seconds.

- In nine seconds?
- That's not an easy feat.

- It's not bad, right?
- It's not that good.

1084
00:59:14,230 --> 00:59:16,720
- Numbers one through three are best.
- Number five isn't a good pick.

[Only the ace players will participate
from the Blue Team this time?]

1133
01:01:40,010 --> 01:01:41,510
I'm going to stay out of it.

1134
01:01:42,330 --> 01:01:44,410
- Then you're the one of the aces?
- No, I'm staying out of it.

1135
01:01:45,580 --> 01:01:47,190
- Number four.
- It really does hurt, doesn't it?

1136
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:48,810
It really hurts.

1137
01:01:48,810 --> 01:01:49,860
Okay, number four.

1138
01:01:49,860 --> 01:01:51,840
- Hopping on one foot is the hardest part.
- Okay, you got it.

1139
01:01:57,270 --> 01:01:58,530
Hyun Joo, are you okay?

1140
01:02:01,010 --> 01:02:02,840
How did you jump on the mat like that?

1141
01:02:02,840 --> 01:02:04,630
There's no need for you
to do all that.

1142
01:02:04,630 --> 01:02:07,210
- You can take it easier.
- Why are you doing that to yourself?

1143
01:02:07,210 --> 01:02:09,700
[Even though he's psyched himself up,
the agony is starting to overtake him.]

1144
01:02:10,900 --> 01:02:13,180
Why did you start off like that?

1145
01:02:13,180 --> 01:02:15,570
- You have to get back!
- You didn't have to start out so hard.

1146
01:02:16,030 --> 01:02:20,110
[Falling down onto his knees.]

1147
01:02:20,110 --> 01:02:21,660
Why did you start off so hard?

1148
01:02:25,090 --> 01:02:27,920
[Son Hyun Joo gives it another try.]

1149
01:02:32,060 --> 01:02:34,880
[Falling back down onto his knees.]

1150
01:02:37,270 --> 01:02:40,640
[Overly eager in his attempt.]

1151
01:02:40,990 --> 01:02:42,590
Let him have one more try.

1152
01:02:42,590 --> 01:02:44,470
He started off too hard.

1153
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:47,370
That would've hurt even on a flat surface
without being on this acupuncture mat.

1154
01:02:47,750 --> 01:02:50,030
Hyung Suk, I don't think he's going to
be able to come in at first place.

1155
01:02:50,330 --> 01:02:53,410
[Hyung Suk...
your father still tried very hard.]

1156
01:02:54,390 --> 01:02:55,740
That really hurts.

1157
01:02:55,970 --> 01:02:59,870
We have decided to give you extra time
and make 50 seconds the new time limit.

1158
01:03:00,580 --> 01:03:02,080
- Number two!
- Okay.

1159
01:03:02,080 --> 01:03:03,170
[Red Team chooses number two.]

1160
01:03:03,170 --> 01:03:04,850
You can do it as long as Ha Ha can do it.

1161
01:03:06,080 --> 01:03:07,990
Okay, let's do this.
Number two, right?

1162
01:03:08,320 --> 01:03:11,490
- Number two, right?
- He's so annoying.

1163
01:03:11,490 --> 01:03:14,030
- I just wanted to make sure.
- We can do it this time.

1164
01:03:16,520 --> 01:03:20,360
[Screaming out the battle cry again
to help forget about the agony.]

1165
01:03:21,660 --> 01:03:24,290
[Completes the course within seconds
as if running a 100m dash.]

1166
01:03:25,050 --> 01:03:27,250
- I think they may do it this time.
- One, two...

1167
01:03:28,020 --> 01:03:31,320
[Mi Sun doing surprisingly well at this game.]

1168
01:03:32,650 --> 01:03:35,480
[It's the problematic Ha Ha's turn.]

1169
01:03:40,260 --> 01:03:43,570
[Screaming out the same battle cry
that his teacher has taught him.]

1170
01:03:43,570 --> 01:03:45,530
Hurry!
My feet hurts!

1171
01:03:45,530 --> 01:03:53,070
[Will they succeed this time?]

1172
01:03:53,070 --> 01:03:54,350
[Huh?]

1173
01:03:54,360 --> 01:03:57,400
[Landing on both feet?]

1174
01:03:58,870 --> 01:04:02,630
[Is this your first time playing this game?]

1175
01:04:02,630 --> 01:04:03,960
What!

1176
01:04:05,340 --> 01:04:07,530
[Turning right around to do it again.]

1177
01:04:07,530 --> 01:04:08,890
He can't do that.

1178
01:04:08,890 --> 01:04:10,890
- On one foot!
- You have to do it on one foot!

1179
01:04:13,040 --> 01:04:15,060
You have to do it on one foot from there!
Hop on your right foot!

1180
01:04:15,060 --> 01:04:16,450
- Just on your right foot!
- On one foot!

1181
01:04:17,290 --> 01:04:19,890
[He lands on both feet again!]

1182
01:04:19,890 --> 01:04:22,320
- I did it. Come on!
- I told you to hop on your right foot!

1183
01:04:22,320 --> 01:04:23,740
- Come on, I did it!
- It's okay. Do it again!

1184
01:04:23,750 --> 01:04:25,290
Come on, just do it again!

1185
01:04:25,290 --> 01:04:27,930
[Heads back out again.]

1186
01:04:27,930 --> 01:04:29,300
I don't think I can do this.

1187
01:04:30,320 --> 01:04:31,970
You guys can't do it because of him.
You won't be able to pass this.

1188
01:04:31,970 --> 01:04:33,220
[Red Team unfortunately fails.]

1189
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:36,610
You could've passed this course if
you had been on one foot.

1190
01:04:37,670 --> 01:04:40,090
[One person who still can't seem to
comprehend the rules of the game.]

1191
01:04:40,090 --> 01:04:41,790
Don't you even know how to play this?

1192
01:04:41,790 --> 01:04:43,300
You have to do it on one foot.

1193
01:04:43,310 --> 01:04:46,330
You were still within your time even
with Ha Ha's second attempt.

1194
01:04:46,340 --> 01:04:48,260
Can't you just let us pass then?

1195
01:04:48,260 --> 01:04:52,170
Hey, you practically made it through.
You just needed to hop on one foot.

1196
01:04:52,170 --> 01:04:53,840
[Time for reflection with Coach Kkuk.]

1197
01:04:53,840 --> 01:04:56,560
[Explosion of his nonstop nagging.]

1198
01:04:57,410 --> 01:05:00,360
Just because you're screaming out your
battle cry doesn't mean you're finished.

1199
01:05:00,360 --> 01:05:05,310
It's not just about screaming,
but you have to think as you go.

1200
01:05:05,630 --> 01:05:08,250
[Not muttering a sound,
and only responding when spoken to.]

1201
01:05:09,060 --> 01:05:11,650
Aren't you even sick of being scolded?
Just get it done for once.

1202
01:05:14,670 --> 01:05:15,640
Okay, I'll do it.

1203
01:05:15,640 --> 01:05:17,200
[Blue Team makes another attempt.]

1204
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:18,320
Fighting.

1205
01:05:18,320 --> 01:05:20,940
He's going to do it.
He's really good at this.

1206
01:05:20,940 --> 01:05:23,980
[A real man on the acupuncture mat,
Son Hyun Joo.]

1207
01:05:23,980 --> 01:05:27,110
[Flying through the mat again without
any sense of hesitation.]

1208
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:32,280
[The god of acting's
determined one footed hop.]

1209
01:05:33,420 --> 01:05:36,640
[Just like Park Ji Sung's feet that've seen
glory on Europe's infamous field.]

1210
01:05:37,610 --> 01:05:40,940
[Just like Ballerina Kang Su Jin's feet
that touched the hearts of the whole world.]

1211
01:05:41,740 --> 01:05:45,600
[Son Hyun Joo's feet that brought tears
and shock to everyone on the acupuncture mat.]

1212
01:05:47,470 --> 01:05:52,420
[Son, are you watching this?
A show of your father's determination?]

1213
01:05:52,980 --> 01:05:56,990
[Hyung Suk... are you watching this?]

1214
01:06:00,710 --> 01:06:03,400
[After his explosive run through the course,
he's trying to pull himself back together.]

1215
01:06:04,270 --> 01:06:06,260
He's jumped through all these spaces
hopping on only one foot.

1216
01:06:06,990 --> 01:06:10,040
[Gary seems to have acclimated himself
to the feel of the mat somewhat as well.]

1217
01:06:10,040 --> 01:06:11,770
- You're doing great.
- I'm determined.

1218
01:06:12,700 --> 01:06:13,860
You got it.

1219
01:06:20,860 --> 01:06:23,360
[Now as long as Jae Suk can get through it!]

1220
01:06:24,550 --> 01:06:26,300
[Huh?]

1221
01:06:26,300 --> 01:06:28,440
[Jae Suk lands on space seven
on both feet.]

1222
01:06:28,440 --> 01:06:30,240
Hurry up and come back!

1223
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:31,930
[Must rush back to start over.]

1224
01:06:31,930 --> 01:06:33,170
Hurry!

1225
01:06:37,970 --> 01:06:40,340
[You Hyuk ultimately
brought down to his knees.]

1226
01:06:40,340 --> 01:06:44,820
- I don't think I can do this.
- Can you make it a minute? It really hurts.

1227
01:06:44,820 --> 01:06:50,870
Just one person from each team can wear
one sock on just one of their feet.

1228
01:06:50,870 --> 01:06:53,280
- The time will remain the same.
- Just one person?

1229
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:54,670
50 seconds?

1230
01:06:55,680 --> 01:06:58,010
[Blue Team who started off first gets to
have a try under the new rule.]

1231
01:06:58,010 --> 01:06:59,910
But if we can succeed this time,
the game's over, right?

1232
01:06:59,910 --> 01:07:02,070
I think that the Blue Team
is going to do it then.

1233
01:07:02,630 --> 01:07:04,620
You're going to do it now without
wearing the one sock?

1234
01:07:04,630 --> 01:07:05,670
- Okay, then.
- Go ahead.

1235
01:07:05,670 --> 01:07:08,410
- We have to give it a try too.
- Why are you making that decision for us?

1236
01:07:08,420 --> 01:07:10,160
- You need to discuss it with us.
- You didn't even ask for our opinion.

1237
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:12,060
Why are you insisting on doing this
when we've been told we can wear socks?

1238
01:07:12,060 --> 01:07:14,140
- He said we can wear socks.
- She said she can't do this anymore.

1239
01:07:14,140 --> 01:07:17,420
- Blue Team is going to succeed next time.
- Yeah, Jae Suk is their only problem.

1240
01:07:17,420 --> 01:07:19,330
We need to give ourselves a chance to win
before Blue Team gets to go again.

1241
01:07:20,040 --> 01:07:22,400
We'd be more inclined to follow you if
you had shown us something.

1242
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:23,680
Just do it!

1243
01:07:23,680 --> 01:07:24,990
Just do it, okay?

1244
01:07:25,450 --> 01:07:27,570
[Letting his hand fly at the disagreement.]

1245
01:07:27,570 --> 01:07:29,460
- Look, I picked number two.
- You look like a leader.

1246
01:07:29,460 --> 01:07:31,510
- Suk Jin has leadership.
- You look like a leader.

1247
01:07:32,270 --> 01:07:34,290
He's only like this when he's with me.

1248
01:07:35,170 --> 01:07:36,870
Okay, I'll go first.

1249
01:07:36,870 --> 01:07:38,530
[Yellow Team takes their turn
without the added bonus of a sock.]

1250
01:07:39,670 --> 01:07:43,210
[Actress Moon is the first to
start off the game.]

1251
01:07:43,210 --> 01:07:45,350
- I think they may do it this time.
- We are going to do this.

1252
01:07:45,350 --> 01:07:48,160
[Going through the whole course without
crying out one single time.]

1253
01:07:48,160 --> 01:07:49,870
[Actress Moon gets through the course.]

1254
01:07:52,030 --> 01:07:54,180
You have to make sure that you do this!
Don't forget to hop on one foot.

1255
01:07:55,010 --> 01:07:57,320
If you don't succeed this time,
you're dead. Okay, Suk Jin?

1256
01:07:58,820 --> 01:08:01,320
[Actress Moon's frightening words
of encouragement.]

1257
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:04,910
You have to get through it.

1258
01:08:04,910 --> 01:08:07,460
- There you go! Bend down and grab it.
- Grab the stone now.

1259
01:08:08,220 --> 01:08:10,130
Okay.
Kwang Soo, fighting!

1260
01:08:10,130 --> 01:08:12,220
[It's already down
to the last player, Kwang Soo.]

1261
01:08:12,220 --> 01:08:14,290
Kwang Soo, fighting!
You can do this!

1262
01:08:15,530 --> 01:08:19,960
[Going through at top speed with the added
boost of Actress Moon's encouragement.]

1263
01:08:19,970 --> 01:08:21,780
[Pass]

1264
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:23,750
- How many seconds?
- What's our time?

1265
01:08:23,750 --> 01:08:25,040
Success.

1266
01:08:25,040 --> 01:08:27,310
[Yellow Team succeeds!]

1267
01:08:29,100 --> 01:08:30,610
I'm sorry, Hyung Suk.

1268
01:08:31,020 --> 01:08:33,280
It's all my fault.
I'm sorry.

1269
01:08:33,280 --> 01:08:35,320
I had no other choice because
it just hurts too much.

1270
01:08:35,750 --> 01:08:37,390
I'm sorry, Hyung Suk.

1271
01:08:37,700 --> 01:08:39,320
Your dad did really great though.

1272
01:08:39,640 --> 01:08:41,340
You finally got yourself a hint.

1273
01:08:41,340 --> 01:08:44,890
Yellow Team just earned themselves
the highest level of clues.

1274
01:08:44,890 --> 01:08:46,210
[Yellow Teams gets the best clue
for having come in at first place.]

1275
01:08:46,210 --> 01:08:49,100
Once you see this hint,
you'll be able to guess a few.

1276
01:08:49,100 --> 01:08:50,220
[Top level clue just as it's labeled.]

1277
01:08:50,220 --> 01:08:52,250
- And also...
- What is he talking about?

1278
01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:54,790
You can figure that out by yourself later.

1279
01:08:55,590 --> 01:08:57,860
Don't you know what yours is?

1280
01:08:57,860 --> 01:09:01,380
So you didn't even know what you were
reading off that card earlier?

1281
01:09:01,530 --> 01:09:04,450
Next, Red Team will receive
a mid-grade level clue.

1282
01:09:04,450 --> 01:09:06,610
And Blue Team will receive the lowest
level of clues.

1283
01:09:06,610 --> 01:09:07,860
Yes, I understand.

1284
01:09:09,560 --> 01:09:11,460
[Next mission-
Public hide-and-seek.]

1285
01:09:11,460 --> 01:09:13,940
[One member at a time from each team must
infiltrate a crowd of people in public.]

1286
01:09:13,940 --> 01:09:17,580
[Must complete their mission and get out
without being recognized to succeed.]

1287
01:09:18,720 --> 01:09:20,460
[Hyun Joo's mission-
Eat a snack without getting recognized.]

1288
01:09:20,460 --> 01:09:23,830
You have to buy the fried chicken,
eat the snack at the stand

1289
01:09:23,830 --> 01:09:26,210
and get back out to pass.

1290
01:09:26,210 --> 01:09:27,720
[But Hyun Joo succeeds his mission!]

1291
01:09:29,890 --> 01:09:31,190
[Jae Suk and Ji Hyo's mission.]

1292
01:09:31,190 --> 01:09:33,780
[Make it through the market with the torn
umbrella without being recognized.]

1293
01:09:33,780 --> 01:09:36,210
[Disguising themselves as a couple?
Succeeds the mission.]

1294
01:09:36,480 --> 01:09:38,230
[Kwang Soo's mission-
The village idiot...]

1295
01:09:38,230 --> 01:09:40,910
[Actually, the real mission is to buy a
wineglass and get back before he's caught.]

1296
01:09:40,910 --> 01:09:42,220
Look at all those people following him
right now.

1297
01:09:42,220 --> 01:09:43,700
I just want to go home.

1298
01:09:43,700 --> 01:09:45,610
[Kwang Soo fails.]

1299
01:09:46,230 --> 01:09:48,480
- Do we get another hint?
- Look, we get another hint.

1300
01:09:48,480 --> 01:09:50,690
[Another hint is handed out.]

1301
01:09:51,750 --> 01:09:54,690
- This is another clue?
- Are they all this obvious?

1302
01:09:55,950 --> 01:09:58,660
[Everyone seems to have figured out
who has which number?]

1303
01:10:05,740 --> 01:10:07,460
[On their way to the final location.]

1304
01:10:07,470 --> 01:10:10,160
- Can't you tell me what yours says?
- What about you?

1305
01:10:10,160 --> 01:10:12,060
- Then me yours first.
- What does yours say?

1306
01:10:12,060 --> 01:10:14,250
- Let's all reveal it together.
- Okay, together. One, two, three.

1307
01:10:14,250 --> 01:10:15,880
See?
It's the same hint.

1308
01:10:15,880 --> 01:10:19,930
Such and such numbers are actors,
and such and such numbers are singers.

1309
01:10:19,940 --> 01:10:22,900
- Is yours something like that too?
- Ones I know for sure are Jae Suk's, yours...

1310
01:10:22,930 --> 01:10:27,910
[Will they be able to guess
their own numbers?]

1311
01:10:38,090 --> 01:10:39,710
[Numbered Hide-and-Seek Race-
Final location.]

1312
01:10:39,710 --> 01:10:41,050
[Aqua studio]

1313
01:10:41,050 --> 01:10:45,980
[Find the 'R' flag!]

1314
01:10:51,800 --> 01:10:52,790
What is this?

1315
01:10:52,790 --> 01:10:54,420
[Here's the flag!]

1316
01:10:58,760 --> 01:10:59,870
Okay!

1317
01:10:59,870 --> 01:11:02,060
[Yoo Hyuk is the first to arrive!]

1318
01:11:02,060 --> 01:11:03,150
This is an individual race.

1319
01:11:03,150 --> 01:11:05,680
Yoo Jae Suk is in first place,
and Lee Kwang Soo is in second place.

1320
01:11:05,680 --> 01:11:08,380
[Everyone to stand in line
in the order of their arrival.]

1321
01:11:09,330 --> 01:11:12,380
[Hyung Suk's dad trying to piece all the
clues together in midst of all this.]

1322
01:11:12,380 --> 01:11:14,420
- Ddak-ji king is Jae Suk, right?
- Jae Suk is one of them.

1323
01:11:14,420 --> 01:11:16,980
And Jong Kook too.
It's Jae Suk and Jong Kook both.

1324
01:11:19,780 --> 01:11:21,750
[Is he trying to be sly and cut in line?]

1325
01:11:26,550 --> 01:11:30,450
Okay, this is the final
individual mission time.

1326
01:11:31,090 --> 01:11:36,070
I hope that you've gotten an idea of who
has which number on their backs

1327
01:11:36,070 --> 01:11:38,570
by piecing together the clues that
you've all been given.

1328
01:11:39,080 --> 01:11:43,160
You will all be climbing atop that structure
and sitting on top of it.

1329
01:11:44,040 --> 01:11:47,680
[What?
On top of that structure?]

1330
01:11:47,680 --> 01:11:50,940
While seated on that structure,
you'll have to guess who has which number.

1331
01:11:50,940 --> 01:11:52,190
If you guess it correctly

1332
01:11:52,190 --> 01:11:54,150
the person who has the number that
you guessed will fall

1333
01:11:54,150 --> 01:11:57,400
and if you get it wrong, the person who
took the guess will fall.

1334
01:11:57,820 --> 01:12:00,240
So going first isn't necessarily
a good thing.

1335
01:12:00,240 --> 01:12:02,490
Wow, the water is so deep.

1336
01:12:02,490 --> 01:12:05,120
- What if I get it wrong?
- You have to get lucky with the number.

1337
01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:06,760
This is all about the luck of the draw.

1338
01:12:06,760 --> 01:12:08,620
Okay, everyone may now climb up there.

1339
01:12:09,240 --> 01:12:12,570
[Everyone is seated
in the order of their arrival.]

1340
01:12:12,580 --> 01:12:13,890
I'm so nervous!

1341
01:12:14,780 --> 01:12:18,040
- Okay... raise them up.
- What? We're being raised up?

1342
01:12:18,040 --> 01:12:21,810
- You're going to raise us up?
- Is this being raised? What is this?

1343
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:25,560
- This is going to be raised up?
- You're raising us up?

1344
01:12:25,560 --> 01:12:27,520
We're not getting dumped from here?

1345
01:12:30,600 --> 01:12:33,400
- Stop!
- What do you guys think you're doing?

1346
01:12:33,400 --> 01:12:35,040
How far are you raising this up?

1347
01:12:44,910 --> 01:12:47,150
- Stop!
- This is enough! Stop it!

1348
01:12:50,130 --> 01:12:55,560
[Wow... this is high.]

1349
01:12:57,430 --> 01:13:01,890
[All the members are now seated
in the midair chairs.]

1350
01:13:01,890 --> 01:13:04,860
Yoo Jae Suk will start off with his guess
since he was the first one to have arrived.

1351
01:13:04,870 --> 01:13:07,460
I didn't know that arriving first
would mean having to do this.

1352
01:13:07,890 --> 01:13:10,820
Judge Go Dong Wan will draw a number.

1353
01:13:10,820 --> 01:13:12,360
Don't look when you pick the number.

1354
01:13:12,360 --> 01:13:21,760
[The number he's going to have
to guess is...]

1355
01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:24,670
[Number one.]

1356
01:13:24,670 --> 01:13:26,190
- Number one.
- Number one?

1357
01:13:26,930 --> 01:13:31,480
Yoo Jae Suk must shout out the name of the
person who he believes to be number one.

1358
01:13:31,480 --> 01:13:34,560
If he guesses correctly, then
that person will be dumped in the water.

1359
01:13:35,410 --> 01:13:38,480
But if he guesses wrong,
Yoo Jae Suk himself will be dumped.

1360
01:13:38,480 --> 01:13:42,750
[Guess right, then he survives.
Guess wrong, then he gets dumped.]

1361
01:13:44,530 --> 01:13:47,390
- Being up front isn't good.
- Being first isn't a good thing!

1362
01:13:50,090 --> 01:13:55,240
[Who's number one?]

1363
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,310
Number five.
The king of all animals.

1364
01:13:58,340 --> 01:14:00,030
And Monday, Tuesday drama.

1365
01:14:00,030 --> 01:14:01,320
Number five is Kwang Soo, right?

1366
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:05,000
I think number four is Hyun Joo.
If number five...

1367
01:14:05,580 --> 01:14:08,620
If number four is Hyun Joo, then
five would definitely be Kwang Soo.

1368
01:14:09,630 --> 01:14:12,090
Numbers two and ten are ddak-ji kings.

1369
01:14:12,090 --> 01:14:13,840
Then would mean it's either me
or Jong Kook.

1370
01:14:13,840 --> 01:14:15,370
[Numbers two and ten would be either
Jong Kook or Jae Suk.]

1371
01:14:15,370 --> 01:14:17,080
But...

1372
01:14:17,080 --> 01:14:21,150
[Then who is number one?]

1373
01:14:22,700 --> 01:14:25,080
I'm not quite sure who it is.
I'm just going to have to guess.

1374
01:14:25,080 --> 01:14:27,410
[In one word...
he's going to have to take a guess.]

1375
01:14:27,410 --> 01:14:29,100
[Numbers 3-7 are actors and 2 and 10
are Jong Kook or Jae Suk.]

1376
01:14:29,110 --> 01:14:31,890
[Then that means...]

1377
01:14:31,890 --> 01:14:35,450
[Number one has to be either
Ha Ha, Suk Jin, or Gary?]

1378
01:14:35,450 --> 01:14:36,760
I have to take a guess.

1379
01:14:36,760 --> 01:14:39,050
[Jae Suk having to guess between
the three.]

1380
01:14:39,050 --> 01:14:41,030
On the count of five,
you have to shout out the person's name.

1381
01:14:41,030 --> 01:14:44,150
Five, four, three...

1382
01:14:44,150 --> 01:14:51,210
[Which one of these is number one?]

1383
01:14:53,140 --> 01:14:55,330
I don't know who number one is!
Gary?

1384
01:14:56,070 --> 01:14:58,220
I don't know who number one is!
Gary?

1385
01:14:58,220 --> 01:15:00,080
[Jae Suk guesses Gary to be
number one.]

1386
01:15:00,080 --> 01:15:01,250
Gary!

1387
01:15:05,550 --> 01:15:07,350
[Did he guess correctly?]

1388
01:15:07,350 --> 01:15:09,930
[Or is he wrong?]

1389
01:15:21,100 --> 01:15:24,010
[Wow! Number one is Gary!]

1390
01:15:24,320 --> 01:15:25,610
This is so scary!

1391
01:15:31,570 --> 01:15:33,070
- Gary.
- Stop!

1392
01:15:33,070 --> 01:15:34,730
Stop this!

1393
01:15:35,180 --> 01:15:36,620
- Gary.
- Stop!

1394
01:15:39,010 --> 01:15:42,250
[One person in need of a rescue.]

1395
01:15:44,090 --> 01:15:45,410
This is driving me crazy.

1396
01:15:46,340 --> 01:15:49,360
This is so annoying!
Why am I the first?

1397
01:15:49,360 --> 01:15:51,130
I knew this was going to happen!

1398
01:15:52,650 --> 01:15:56,250
Okay, Yoo Jae Suk guessed correctly
and Gary is number one.

1399
01:15:56,250 --> 01:15:57,500
[Number one was Gary.]

1400
01:15:59,170 --> 01:16:02,710
He's received an award in the past
for his dancing.

1401
01:16:03,130 --> 01:16:07,180
And numbers one and three has
something to do with Mondays.

1402
01:16:07,180 --> 01:16:10,340
Number one... is Kang Gary.

1403
01:16:11,270 --> 01:16:12,520
I'm...

1404
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:14,420
number one.

1405
01:16:14,420 --> 01:16:16,370
[He himself knew what his own
number was.]

1406
01:16:16,370 --> 01:16:18,020
[That's why he looked so distressed
right before he took his dive.]

1407
01:16:18,020 --> 01:16:20,550
[And then took the plunge.]

1408
01:16:22,210 --> 01:16:23,430
This is really scary.

1409
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:27,400
Gary's empty chair looks so scary.

1410
01:16:27,400 --> 01:16:30,120
- Look at this chair.
- So that's what happens.

1411
01:16:30,120 --> 01:16:31,790
That's too scary.

1412
01:16:31,790 --> 01:16:34,210
I don't remember any of the numbers
that I thought about.

1413
01:16:34,670 --> 01:16:37,330
Second person to have arrived,
Lee Kwang Soo.

1414
01:16:37,620 --> 01:16:40,230
We will not pick the number that
Lee Kwang Soo has to guess.

1415
01:16:40,230 --> 01:16:41,990
[It's Kwang Soo's turn to take a guess.]

1416
01:16:44,230 --> 01:16:45,830
You think you'll get it?

1417
01:16:45,830 --> 01:16:50,210
[And that number is...]

1418
01:16:50,470 --> 01:16:51,790
Number ten!

1419
01:16:51,790 --> 01:16:54,050
[And that number is... number ten.]

1420
01:16:54,050 --> 01:16:55,690
- Number ten.
- Number ten.

1421
01:16:56,530 --> 01:16:58,610
[Panic]

1422
01:16:58,610 --> 01:17:01,500
- You have to shout out the person's name.
- You told me that I was the star today!

1423
01:17:01,500 --> 01:17:02,860
You will be given five seconds.

1424
01:17:04,380 --> 01:17:08,540
[Who could number ten be?]

1425
01:17:08,540 --> 01:17:10,710
When I looked at all the clues
back in the car...

1426
01:17:10,710 --> 01:17:12,060
I think that number ten...

1427
01:17:12,060 --> 01:17:13,860
Number ten wears glasses.

1428
01:17:13,860 --> 01:17:16,060
- Would that be Jae Suk?
- I've known him for the past ten years.

1429
01:17:18,720 --> 01:17:21,280
That much I'm sure of.

1430
01:17:21,280 --> 01:17:28,520
[Number ten has to be either
a singer or a comedian...]

1431
01:17:29,300 --> 01:17:31,560
I can see someone sitting very
stiffly in their chair.

1432
01:17:37,330 --> 01:17:38,980
Look at how stiff he looks up there.
The poor thing!

1433
01:17:40,690 --> 01:17:45,230
[Telling him to prepare himself?]

1434
01:17:46,820 --> 01:17:51,220
Five, four, three, two, one.

1435
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:53,090
Number ten is Yoo Jae Suk!

1436
01:17:54,060 --> 01:17:55,770
Number ten is Yoo Jae Suk!

1437
01:17:55,770 --> 01:18:00,740
[Number ten is Jae Suk?]

1438
01:18:03,350 --> 01:18:06,570
[Correct]

1439
01:18:09,980 --> 01:18:11,810
- That chair is so scary.
- Lee Kwang Soo!

1440
01:18:13,580 --> 01:18:15,590
I survived!

1441
01:18:18,090 --> 01:18:22,230
- Lee Kwang Soo, that was low!
- Everyone's ultimately alone in this life!

1442
01:18:22,840 --> 01:18:26,050
I'm so scared!
I'm so scared of getting dumped.

1443
01:18:26,060 --> 01:18:29,400
We will now choose the number that
Moon Jung Hee will have to guess.

1444
01:18:30,280 --> 01:18:31,690
Number eight.

1445
01:18:31,690 --> 01:18:34,760
- Number eight.
- I don't know!

1446
01:18:36,270 --> 01:18:39,070
[She doesn't look so sure...]

1447
01:18:44,690 --> 01:18:46,380
Number eight.

1448
01:18:46,380 --> 01:18:49,020
- I'll count to five.
- Kim Jong Kook!

1449
01:18:49,840 --> 01:18:53,130
[She chooses Jong Kook to be
number eight.]

1450
01:18:53,260 --> 01:18:56,270
- Jung Hee!
- Number eight is Kim Jong Kook?

1451
01:18:56,280 --> 01:18:58,650
[She picks Jong Kook as number eight.]

1452
01:18:59,350 --> 01:19:05,350
[Is number eight... really Jong Kook?]

1453
01:19:08,780 --> 01:19:12,500
[Number eight isn't Jong Kook!]

1454
01:19:14,600 --> 01:19:16,180
Wow, that's really scary.

1455
01:19:16,180 --> 01:19:19,680
I'm so scared!
All my friends are now gone!

1456
01:19:20,910 --> 01:19:23,130
- Where did all my friends go?
- They're all disappearing one by one!

1457
01:19:23,130 --> 01:19:24,500
Why did she pick me?

1458
01:19:24,570 --> 01:19:26,680
- It's not him?
- Are you okay?

1459
01:19:27,640 --> 01:19:30,960
[What's going on here?]

1460
01:19:31,230 --> 01:19:33,380
[Suk Jin with the hint about
someone else's line of career.]

1461
01:19:33,380 --> 01:19:34,830
Number eight is a singer too, right?

1462
01:19:35,280 --> 01:19:37,880
It's a singer, right?

1463
01:19:37,880 --> 01:19:39,730
[Playing ignorance.]

1464
01:19:40,190 --> 01:19:44,950
- Why are you acting so serious?
- Then Jong Kook is number eight?

1465
01:19:44,950 --> 01:19:47,690
[She guesses Jong Kook to be
number eight.]

1466
01:19:48,030 --> 01:19:54,140
[But Suk Jin's clue says...
'Numbers 8 and 10 are comedians.']

1467
01:19:55,240 --> 01:19:59,920
[Jung Hee totally fell for Suk Jin's trick.]

1468
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:00,990
No, you can't take it off.

1469
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:04,570
[Jung Hee can't reveal her own number
since no one has guessed it yet.]

1470
01:20:04,570 --> 01:20:06,260
Next is Ji Suk Jin's turn.

1471
01:20:06,260 --> 01:20:08,150
Please let it be a number I know.

1472
01:20:10,090 --> 01:20:12,030
- Please!
- Number nine.

1473
01:20:12,040 --> 01:20:14,050
[The number he must guess is number nine.]

1474
01:20:14,730 --> 01:20:16,850
This is a 50/50 chance.

1475
01:20:16,850 --> 01:20:19,780
[Who is number nine?]

1476
01:20:19,790 --> 01:20:21,790
- Please shout out the person's name.
- Don't say my name because it isn't me.

1477
01:20:28,510 --> 01:20:31,110
I know everyone and their jobs.

1478
01:20:31,910 --> 01:20:34,580
Number one, two and nine are singers.

1479
01:20:34,890 --> 01:20:37,030
And number ten is a comedian.

1480
01:20:38,050 --> 01:20:39,860
One thing that I know for sure...

1481
01:20:41,560 --> 01:20:43,920
is that number one is Kang Gary.

1482
01:20:44,330 --> 01:20:47,320
So number two is either Ha Ha
or Jong Kook.

1483
01:20:47,320 --> 01:20:49,260
And number nine is also
either Ha Ha or Jong Kook.

1484
01:20:54,240 --> 01:20:56,380
This really is a 50/50 chance.

1485
01:20:56,380 --> 01:20:58,480
[A 50/50 chance!]

1486
01:20:59,920 --> 01:21:02,660
[Is it Jong Kook or Ha Ha that's
number nine?]

1487
01:21:02,670 --> 01:21:04,490
Number nine is... Ha Ha!

1488
01:21:07,220 --> 01:21:11,670
[Could it be?]

1489
01:21:16,230 --> 01:21:17,690
Wow!
I got it right!

1490
01:21:24,220 --> 01:21:26,810
[Guesses correctly!
Number nine is Ha Ha!]

1491
01:21:26,810 --> 01:21:28,790
This actually makes me feel better.

1492
01:21:28,790 --> 01:21:30,690
I actually feel much better!

1493
01:21:32,010 --> 01:21:33,290
Wow, I feel so much better.

1494
01:21:33,690 --> 01:21:36,230
[It was a 50/50 guess,
and he guesses correctly!]

1495
01:21:36,950 --> 01:21:38,920
It's Mi Sun's turn.

1496
01:21:38,930 --> 01:21:40,510
[Next up is Mi Sun.]

1497
01:21:46,020 --> 01:21:50,560
[The number she has to guess is,
Number eight.]

1498
01:21:51,250 --> 01:21:53,090
I think I know this one.

1499
01:21:53,090 --> 01:21:54,800
It's not me, right?
It's not me?

1500
01:21:55,970 --> 01:22:01,010
[Who could number eight be?]

1501
01:22:01,020 --> 01:22:04,800
- It's not me, right? I'm not number eight.
- Five, four, three, two...

1502
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:06,980
Two, one.

1503
01:22:06,990 --> 01:22:09,840
Number eight is... Ji Suk Jin!

1504
01:22:11,100 --> 01:22:12,790
Ji Suk Jin!

1505
01:22:25,850 --> 01:22:27,850
[Number eight is Ji Suk Jin!]

1506
01:22:27,850 --> 01:22:29,740
You've been tricking everyone all day!
You deserve it!

1507
01:22:33,290 --> 01:22:35,000
I knew all the answers too!

1508
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:39,080
[Big-nose having taunted everyone
all day that he knows who everyone is.]

1509
01:22:39,080 --> 01:22:41,230
It's Kim Jong Kook's turn.
Please pick the number.

1510
01:22:42,770 --> 01:22:44,760
- What's left?
- Number three.

1511
01:22:44,760 --> 01:22:46,900
[The number he has to guess
is number three.]

1512
01:22:46,900 --> 01:22:47,880
Number three.

1513
01:22:47,890 --> 01:22:49,640
Number three.

1514
01:22:52,190 --> 01:22:54,490
- Five, four, three...
- Seriously!

1515
01:22:54,490 --> 01:22:58,000
[He doesn't seem to know?]

1516
01:22:58,300 --> 01:23:03,180
I don't know who numbers three, four,
five, six and seven are.

1517
01:23:05,530 --> 01:23:08,520
My number is... number two.

1518
01:23:08,520 --> 01:23:10,900
[Of all the numbers to pick,
he picks the one that he doesn't know.]

1519
01:23:13,930 --> 01:23:18,580
[Hint- Jong Kook is not number two.]

1520
01:23:18,580 --> 01:23:23,160
[So the chances are one out of five.]

1521
01:23:23,740 --> 01:23:27,030
[Of these that are left...
who's number three?]

1522
01:23:27,030 --> 01:23:28,370
Seriously!

1523
01:23:29,700 --> 01:23:31,110
Number three is Song Ji Hyo!

1524
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:37,810
[Could Ji Hyo really be number three?]

1525
01:23:49,070 --> 01:23:50,180
Seriously?

1526
01:23:50,850 --> 01:23:53,670
[How can this be?
Ji Hyo really is number three?]

1527
01:23:53,670 --> 01:23:54,850
Really?

1528
01:23:54,850 --> 01:23:58,150
[Mr. Capable beats the odds!]

1529
01:23:58,150 --> 01:23:59,420
I totally guessed!

1530
01:23:59,420 --> 01:24:02,100
- That was a guess!
- That was a good guess.

1531
01:24:02,110 --> 01:24:03,520
[Darn...]

1532
01:24:03,520 --> 01:24:05,190
The odds are shrinking.

1533
01:24:05,190 --> 01:24:06,990
I think that maybe I can win.

1534
01:24:07,480 --> 01:24:09,690
We're checking to make sure
that Ji Hyo is number three.

1535
01:24:09,690 --> 01:24:12,070
- Number three.
- She really is number three? I just guessed!

1536
01:24:12,070 --> 01:24:14,900
The chances of winning for the remaining
players have gone up significantly.

1537
01:24:14,900 --> 01:24:16,990
[Only four people are left.]

1538
01:24:18,110 --> 01:24:21,130
We will now choose the number that
Son Hyun Joo has to guess.

1539
01:24:25,730 --> 01:24:29,280
[The number he has to guess is,
number five.]

1540
01:24:30,180 --> 01:24:33,490
[Why the sudden laughter?]

1541
01:24:35,010 --> 01:24:36,180
Number five!

1542
01:24:36,180 --> 01:24:37,500
I will count to five.

1543
01:24:37,500 --> 01:24:39,460
Lee Kwang Soo!

1544
01:24:39,460 --> 01:24:41,720
- Lee Kwang Soo!
- Me?

1545
01:24:41,720 --> 01:24:43,040
It's not me!

1546
01:24:43,540 --> 01:24:44,580
Is it me?

1547
01:24:44,580 --> 01:24:46,110
I'm number five?

1548
01:24:46,480 --> 01:24:48,670
- Bye.
- Bye!

1549
01:24:48,670 --> 01:24:50,410
- I'm number five?
- Bye, Kwang Soo.

1550
01:24:50,410 --> 01:24:51,810
I'm number five?

1551
01:24:55,290 --> 01:24:58,220
[I'm the star of the show today...]

1552
01:25:01,330 --> 01:25:02,390
Seriously?

1553
01:25:03,140 --> 01:25:05,190
- That's more like it.
- I thought I was number six!

1554
01:25:06,400 --> 01:25:08,600
- Seriously?
- Yes, it's Kwang Soo.

1555
01:25:10,410 --> 01:25:12,660
Number five is the king of animals?

1556
01:25:13,230 --> 01:25:14,560
Wont that be Lee Kwang Soo?

1557
01:25:15,650 --> 01:25:17,310
Yes, I saw that episode.
Giraffe becomes the king.

1558
01:25:17,310 --> 01:25:20,830
[Hyung Suk's dad happened to see
that specific episode.]

1559
01:25:20,830 --> 01:25:22,320
Kwang Soo is number five.

1560
01:25:24,190 --> 01:25:27,020
[More people aboard the float.]

1561
01:25:27,190 --> 01:25:29,530
So one of those three
is going to be the winner.

1562
01:25:29,830 --> 01:25:32,880
It's Jun Mi Sun's turn once again.

1563
01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:34,090
[Back to Mi Sun's turn.]

1564
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:39,350
[The number she has to guess is,
number four.]

1565
01:25:42,420 --> 01:25:45,150
[The odds are, one out of four.]

1566
01:25:45,150 --> 01:25:46,310
I will count to five.

1567
01:25:48,030 --> 01:25:51,930
[Including Jung Hee and herself...]

1568
01:25:51,930 --> 01:25:58,870
[If Jong Kook's taken out of the equation
according to this hint...]

1569
01:25:59,820 --> 01:26:04,590
[That means number four would be either
Hyun Joo, Jung Hee or herself.]

1570
01:26:05,190 --> 01:26:07,550
Number four is.. Jun Mi Sun!

1571
01:26:07,550 --> 01:26:09,310
Jun Mi Sun!

1572
01:26:10,170 --> 01:26:12,460
[She picks herself out to be
number four!]

1573
01:26:13,190 --> 01:26:15,510
[Is she right?]

1574
01:26:18,110 --> 01:26:21,550
[Mi Sun isn't number four.]

1575
01:26:21,730 --> 01:26:25,900
[Now there are only two people left...]

1576
01:26:25,900 --> 01:26:28,000
I don't care if I win,
but I'm just so nervous!

1577
01:26:28,700 --> 01:26:30,990
It's Kim Jong Kook's turn now.

1578
01:26:32,190 --> 01:26:33,340
Number four.

1579
01:26:33,340 --> 01:26:35,380
[Number four]

1580
01:26:35,750 --> 01:26:36,960
Number four!

1581
01:26:36,960 --> 01:26:42,120
[It wasn't Mi Sun...
and he's number four...]

1582
01:26:42,120 --> 01:26:45,140
Jung Hee's number hasn't been
verified yet either, right?

1583
01:26:45,140 --> 01:26:51,520
[So that means that number four has to be
either Jung Hee or Hyun Joo!]

1584
01:26:51,520 --> 01:26:53,470
So if Moon Jung Hee's number four...

1585
01:26:53,470 --> 01:26:54,690
then it means that I won't
get dumped, right?

1586
01:26:54,690 --> 01:26:56,280
Stop talking so much!

1587
01:26:59,220 --> 01:27:00,540
Hyun Joo, are your number four?

1588
01:27:01,110 --> 01:27:03,120
You need to stop talking,
and you'll have five seconds.

1589
01:27:03,120 --> 01:27:04,430
[Who's number four?]

1590
01:27:05,420 --> 01:27:08,410
Number four is Moon Jung Hee!

1591
01:27:08,740 --> 01:27:10,990
[Chooses Jung Hee to be number four.]

1592
01:27:10,990 --> 01:27:17,140
[A 50% chance-
Did Mr. Capable get it right?]

1593
01:27:30,060 --> 01:27:32,580
[Jung Hee is not number four!]

1594
01:27:35,510 --> 01:27:38,810
[Hyung Suk's dad wins!]

1595
01:27:40,260 --> 01:27:46,080
[Ex-salsa dance instructor Jung Hee
is number seven.]

1596
01:27:46,080 --> 01:27:48,650
Thus, the winner is...
Son Hyun Joo!

1597
01:27:48,650 --> 01:27:51,870
[Winner is, number four,
Son Hyun Joo!]

1598
01:27:51,870 --> 01:27:53,240
Hyung Suk!

1599
01:27:53,240 --> 01:27:54,660
Jung Min!

1600
01:27:54,660 --> 01:27:55,990
Honey!

1601
01:27:57,340 --> 01:27:59,900
[The god of acting wins!]

1602
01:28:01,970 --> 01:28:03,650
Hyung Suk, your father won.

1603
01:28:08,350 --> 01:28:10,200
He didn't even know his own number.

1604
01:28:10,200 --> 01:28:12,530
[Handing out the prize.]

1605
01:28:14,550 --> 01:28:17,810
[Three 'R' rings!]

1606
01:28:18,470 --> 01:28:20,830
Some people are just born with luck.

1607
01:28:22,340 --> 01:28:24,440
Thank you so much, Running Man!

1608
01:28:24,900 --> 01:28:28,410
[The man who remained so poised even when
he received the best acting award...]

1609
01:28:28,780 --> 01:28:30,300
We should come back on the show.
