7
00:00:13,046 --> 00:00:16,557
[One sunny day in late summer...]

8
00:00:17,171 --> 00:00:20,538
[Running Man members all show up
dressed in their finest.]

9
00:00:21,541 --> 00:00:24,612
[It seems as though everyone's here
dressed in their finest duds.]

10
00:00:24,823 --> 00:00:26,160
Why do you look so tall?

11
00:00:26,161 --> 00:00:28,979
- Are you wearing lifts?
- Why are you wearing lifts?

12
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:31,711
- It's weird to see you looking so tall.
- Gary!

13
00:00:32,241 --> 00:00:33,983
My pants are too big.

14
00:00:33,984 --> 00:00:36,284
[Mr. Gary dressed to the nines.]

15
00:00:36,995 --> 00:00:39,197
You're not playing fair dressed like that.

16
00:00:39,198 --> 00:00:41,000
[It's not your dad's suit, is it?]

17
00:00:41,001 --> 00:00:44,256
- My pants are way too short.
- How are those shoes?

18
00:00:44,257 --> 00:00:46,800
- What do I do about my pants?
- Your jacket is way too long.

19
00:00:46,801 --> 00:00:49,530
- What's he wearing?
- Is he in a marching band or something?

20
00:00:49,531 --> 00:00:52,086
[Huh?
Marching band uniform?]

21
00:00:52,087 --> 00:00:55,228
- What are you wearing?
- You're dressed like Lady Gaga.

22
00:00:55,229 --> 00:00:57,412
- You look great.
- Yes, thank you.

23
00:00:57,413 --> 00:00:59,107
[A jacket with major shoulder padding.]

24
00:00:59,108 --> 00:01:01,083
Do you think that you're a
nutcracker soldier or something?

25
00:01:01,083 --> 00:01:03,114
What about you?
Do you think that you're a security guard?

26
00:01:03,114 --> 00:01:07,064
- Gary put some effort into his outfit.
- Do you have a wedding to go to, Gary?

27
00:01:07,315 --> 00:01:09,344
I don't know how I'm expected to live.

28
00:01:09,993 --> 00:01:12,175
Why did you tell us to come
dressed like this today?

29
00:01:12,176 --> 00:01:14,183
- Is it a prince theme today?
- Where's Ji Hyo?

30
00:01:14,184 --> 00:01:18,115
- That's right, Ji Hyo. Where is she?
- She'll probably come out with female guests.

31
00:01:19,807 --> 00:01:21,171
I see someone pulling up.
It's a big van.

32
00:01:21,172 --> 00:01:22,365
[A black car pulling up just at that time.]

33
00:01:24,616 --> 00:01:27,976
[Who could it be?]

34
00:01:30,737 --> 00:01:34,054
[Who are these guests walking with
ease and confidence down the red carpet?]

35
00:01:34,055 --> 00:01:37,799
[Big Bang's Dae Sung, G-Dragon,
and Seung Ri.]

36
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,415
It's Big Bang!

37
00:01:41,875 --> 00:01:45,305
[With their appearance... one man
looking more pathetic than he had...]

38
00:01:45,306 --> 00:01:46,934
I want to go change my clothes.

39
00:01:46,935 --> 00:01:49,293
How am I expected to keep this on
with those guys on the show?

40
00:01:49,293 --> 00:01:50,838
They all look so great.

41
00:01:50,839 --> 00:01:53,382
[The real princes are here.]

42
00:01:53,383 --> 00:01:56,204
[Man... against man.]

43
00:01:58,048 --> 00:01:59,970
- Hello.
- Look how great Dae Sung looks.

44
00:02:01,179 --> 00:02:02,930
You've gotten so much taller, Dae Sung.

45
00:02:02,931 --> 00:02:04,574
The prince has returned.

46
00:02:04,575 --> 00:02:06,612
- When did you get so tall?
- I went through a growth spurt.

47
00:02:08,435 --> 00:02:11,889
- I will now announce your teams for the day.
- But why isn't Ji Hyo here yet?

48
00:02:12,147 --> 00:02:17,373
Yoo Jae Suk, Gary and G-Dragon
are a team.

49
00:02:17,374 --> 00:02:18,796
[Yoo Jae Suk, Gary and G-Dragon
are a team.]

50
00:02:19,426 --> 00:02:22,102
- All the fashionistas are on one team.
- Yes, you're right.

51
00:02:22,103 --> 00:02:25,046
[Marching band geek, Fashionista, and... ?]

52
00:02:25,047 --> 00:02:27,475
You look so pathetic standing next to him.

53
00:02:27,523 --> 00:02:30,487
Kim Jong Kook, Lee Kwang Soo,
and Dae Sung make up the second team.

54
00:02:30,488 --> 00:02:32,944
[Kim Jong Kook, Lee Kwang Soo,
and Dae Sung are another team.]

55
00:02:32,945 --> 00:02:35,368
- All the best are on one team.
- This is awesome.

56
00:02:36,346 --> 00:02:40,436
[Which means, Suk Jin, Ha Ha and
Seung Ri make up the final team.]

57
00:02:41,072 --> 00:02:43,437
I know what this team is all about.

58
00:02:43,438 --> 00:02:45,106
- I know what your team is made of.
- What?

59
00:02:45,107 --> 00:02:46,482
You're the idiot team.

60
00:02:46,483 --> 00:02:48,633
Kwang Soo, your stupidness
hasn't been up to par lately.

61
00:02:48,633 --> 00:02:50,956
Dae Sung is really good at being stupid,
so you'd better step up your game. Go ahead!

62
00:02:51,126 --> 00:02:54,432
[No one's going to beat me today!]

63
00:02:55,092 --> 00:02:57,159
I'll make sure to keep that in mind.

64
00:02:58,245 --> 00:03:00,019
It's a horse drawn carriage!

65
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:01,902
It's a pumpkin carriage.

66
00:03:01,903 --> 00:03:05,140
[Just then, a horse drawn
pumpkin carriage is seen pulling up.]

67
00:03:05,141 --> 00:03:06,904
It's a real live horse pulling that carriage.

68
00:03:07,177 --> 00:03:09,545
Why are you doing all that for Ji Hyo?

69
00:03:09,546 --> 00:03:17,647
[Like a story right out a fairytale...
she arrives in a horse drawn carriage.]

70
00:03:22,225 --> 00:03:23,802
- She even has a butler?
- Ji Hyo!

71
00:03:23,803 --> 00:03:30,647
[She is... about to make her appearance.]

72
00:03:30,648 --> 00:03:34,079
Why are you doing this?
Why are you doing this to us?

73
00:03:34,814 --> 00:03:36,800
She actually looks like a princess.

74
00:03:40,562 --> 00:03:43,667
[Here comes Princess Ji Hyo.]

75
00:03:45,341 --> 00:03:47,064
Big Bang's here?

76
00:03:47,065 --> 00:03:49,611
- You just noticed?
- Yeah, Big Bang's here.

77
00:03:49,612 --> 00:03:51,261
You look kind of pretty
all dressed up like that.

78
00:03:51,262 --> 00:03:53,718
Look at how Gary's dressed today.

79
00:03:53,719 --> 00:03:55,676
They look like they're dressed up
for their wedding.

80
00:03:55,677 --> 00:03:58,173
- This is their wedding.
- They look perfect together.

81
00:03:58,174 --> 00:04:01,627
- Gary's just perfect for this role.
- And Ji Hyo's the city bride.

82
00:04:01,628 --> 00:04:03,923
[Wedding for a country bumpkin groom,
city slicker princess bride.]

83
00:04:03,923 --> 00:04:06,039
You two look very good together like that.

84
00:04:06,817 --> 00:04:11,198
[Arm in arm... and hand in hand.]

85
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:12,910
<i>Your mission today...</i>

86
00:04:12,911 --> 00:04:16,501
<i>Steal Princess Ji Hyo's Heart.</i>

87
00:04:16,502 --> 00:04:18,393
[Today's mission-
Steal Princess Ji Hyo's heart.]

88
00:04:18,394 --> 00:04:21,659
<i>To the team that comes in at
first place with each of the games...</i>

89
00:04:22,158 --> 00:04:25,986
<i>that team will win a big advantage
at the start of your final mission.</i>

90
00:04:30,191 --> 00:04:32,797
<i>To the team that wins the final mission...</i>

91
00:04:32,798 --> 00:04:36,733
<i>they will win something that
Princess Blank has a lot of.</i>

92
00:04:36,734 --> 00:04:38,576
- It's gold!
- It's gold for sure!

93
00:04:40,254 --> 00:04:41,830
Okay, silence everyone.

94
00:04:43,728 --> 00:04:45,188
Okay, silence everyone.

95
00:04:45,189 --> 00:04:48,568
[They were already being quite.]

96
00:04:48,569 --> 00:04:50,126
None of us were even talking.

97
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:52,682
[He's just reading from a script...]

98
00:04:52,683 --> 00:04:57,010
Princess Ji Hyo, who's been known for
being the Ace of Running Man...

99
00:04:57,377 --> 00:05:01,539
she was the winner of the golden ball
in the Hong Kong episode.

100
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:03,429
That's right.
That was the biggest gold prize ever.

101
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:07,202
She won the gold badge in the special episode
when Park Ji Sung guest starred on the show.

102
00:05:07,202 --> 00:05:10,845
She was the singular victor in Vietnam
in the golden turtle episode

103
00:05:10,846 --> 00:05:12,530
and she took home the golden turtle.

104
00:05:12,531 --> 00:05:13,867
That's right, she did.

105
00:05:13,868 --> 00:05:16,896
She has the highest record for winning
the most gold prizes as a sole victor

106
00:05:16,896 --> 00:05:20,786
and it won't be a stretch to say that she
took home the most gold from Running Man.

107
00:05:21,569 --> 00:05:28,663
Currently, Princess Ji Hyo has enough gold
at home to be dubbed, 'Gold Ji Hyo'.

108
00:05:28,664 --> 00:05:31,140
- That's amazing.
- You are amazing.

109
00:05:31,175 --> 00:05:33,672
If you do a good job today,
I will gift out the gold as a royal gift.

110
00:05:33,673 --> 00:05:35,168
[A job well done equals a golden royal gift!]

111
00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:37,951
[A sincere round of applause
for her generosity.]

112
00:05:38,571 --> 00:05:41,104
<i>At the end of each game,
the winning team of that game</i>

113
00:05:41,105 --> 00:05:46,562
<i>will escort Princess Ji Hyo to your next
location in a luxury sedan.</i>

114
00:05:46,563 --> 00:05:50,553
<i>And the other two teams will move on to
the next location in a very old classic car.</i>

115
00:05:50,554 --> 00:05:53,243
- No!
-Is that the same car from last time?

116
00:05:53,244 --> 00:05:54,538
<i>Before we really get started</i>

117
00:05:54,539 --> 00:05:57,624
<i>Princess Ji Hyo will choose the team who
will be escorting her to the first location</i>

118
00:05:57,625 --> 00:06:00,656
<i>by seeing how well you can dance.</i>

119
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:06,983
[Team GD- Dance time!]

120
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:09,253
One, two, three, four!

121
00:06:09,572 --> 00:06:13,649
[Starting off with some flash!]

122
00:06:13,977 --> 00:06:15,232
[Breaking out the moves.]

123
00:06:20,099 --> 00:06:24,546
[Once their choreographed dance is over,
it's time for GD's solo dance.]

124
00:06:25,476 --> 00:06:28,319
[Prince of fashion's dance time.]

125
00:06:31,361 --> 00:06:34,403
[And bringing their dance move
over to Princess Ji Hyo.]

126
00:06:34,404 --> 00:06:37,246
You guys are too heavy!

127
00:06:37,247 --> 00:06:39,450
Just hold still!
Hold still!

128
00:06:39,451 --> 00:06:42,194
Just hold still!
What do you mean, we're heavy?

129
00:06:42,195 --> 00:06:44,218
- You guys are too heavy!
- Just hold still then!

130
00:06:44,219 --> 00:06:46,185
- Just hold still, Ji Hyo!
- Hold on!

131
00:06:47,431 --> 00:06:50,190
[Followed by,
Team Seung Ri's dance time.]

132
00:06:50,191 --> 00:06:52,446
[Huh?
They're not really in sync.]

133
00:06:56,776 --> 00:06:58,457
Suk Jin's moves are too fast.

134
00:06:58,458 --> 00:07:00,300
Suk Jin's moving in
the same direction as Seung Ri.

135
00:07:00,301 --> 00:07:02,006
They're not dancing to the same tune.

136
00:07:03,707 --> 00:07:05,811
[The princess is slowly
starting to get into rhythm.]

137
00:07:08,232 --> 00:07:12,522
[Seung Ri... go!]

138
00:07:17,971 --> 00:07:19,946
[Did she like their dance?]

139
00:07:19,947 --> 00:07:22,540
I'm actually pretty displeased
with their dance.

140
00:07:22,541 --> 00:07:25,322
- Why?
- I'm disappointed in Running Man.

141
00:07:25,323 --> 00:07:27,273
Even just looking at all the teams...

142
00:07:27,274 --> 00:07:29,947
There's the winning team,
second team, and we're the loser team.

143
00:07:29,948 --> 00:07:32,518
- What are you talking about?
- That's a hurtful thing to hear, Dae Sung.

144
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:34,822
[How is our team lacking anything?]

145
00:07:34,823 --> 00:07:36,464
No, that's not true.

146
00:07:36,465 --> 00:07:39,119
- We're not lacking anything.
- Let's get the audience to vote on this.

147
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,725
Over three million of them will say
that we're going to come in at last place.

148
00:07:41,725 --> 00:07:43,424
No one can know anything until
it's all over.

149
00:07:43,526 --> 00:07:47,062
[Then will the self-proclaimed loser team
be dancing to, 'Look at us'?]

150
00:07:47,063 --> 00:07:49,753
[Should I show them what I'm made of?]

151
00:07:50,654 --> 00:07:53,760
[Team Dae Sung's dance time.]

152
00:08:03,466 --> 00:08:04,931
Get out of the way!

153
00:08:17,596 --> 00:08:20,542
[A manly move made by
only Mr. Capable!]

154
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:25,913
That was just his manly gesture.

155
00:08:26,908 --> 00:08:28,885
- We could carry her all the way.
- Team Dae Sung wins!

156
00:08:30,903 --> 00:08:32,485
Team Dae Sung wins!

157
00:08:32,508 --> 00:08:35,390
[A woman's heart...]

158
00:08:36,296 --> 00:08:38,336
[Totally confused...]

159
00:08:38,337 --> 00:08:41,033
- What just happened?
- Play that song for us too.

160
00:08:41,605 --> 00:08:43,463
Would the other two teams
like another chance?

161
00:08:43,642 --> 00:08:47,088
Ji Hyo will soon realize who it is that
she should be watching like this song says.

162
00:08:47,123 --> 00:08:49,433
We're on a totally different level
than the rest of you.

163
00:08:50,581 --> 00:08:53,296
[Team GD's turn to dance to
the new song.]

164
00:08:54,106 --> 00:08:56,674
[One elegant step taken
deliberately at a time.]

165
00:09:11,262 --> 00:09:16,930
[What?]

166
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:29,946
[A kiss out of nowhere!]

167
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:41,222
[Oh my goodness...]

168
00:09:41,223 --> 00:09:44,719
[Look at this man...]

169
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,744
[Congratulations!
Monday Couple's first kiss!]

170
00:09:48,408 --> 00:09:51,946
[How can this be?]

171
00:09:54,117 --> 00:09:56,078
No!
Get away from her!

172
00:09:56,078 --> 00:09:57,106
[What is this now?]

173
00:09:58,024 --> 00:10:00,333
Get away from her!
What are you doing? She's mine!

174
00:10:00,334 --> 00:10:03,087
- I said, get away from her! She's mine!
- I can do it too!

175
00:10:04,148 --> 00:10:06,471
[Total chaos out of the blue.]

176
00:10:07,327 --> 00:10:09,433
[And even Seung Ri?]

177
00:10:10,635 --> 00:10:13,199
[A smoldering atmosphere.]

178
00:10:14,316 --> 00:10:16,251
[This is how popular the princess is!]

179
00:10:16,252 --> 00:10:18,719
Kissing her like that wasn't fair.

180
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,099
[Gary looking extremely smug
after his ambush kiss.]

181
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:23,117
- I heard a smacking sound.
- He really kissed me on my cheek.

182
00:10:23,118 --> 00:10:24,862
He touched my cheek with his lips.

183
00:10:25,535 --> 00:10:27,322
Don't talk to me right now.

184
00:10:28,965 --> 00:10:30,184
Good job, Gary.

185
00:10:30,818 --> 00:10:33,096
Even though everyone did
such a great job...

186
00:10:33,097 --> 00:10:35,685
[Who will Ji Hyo choose
as her first escorts?]

187
00:10:35,686 --> 00:10:37,836
[Team Seung Ri?]

188
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:40,008
[Team Dae Sung?]

189
00:10:40,009 --> 00:10:42,302
[Team GD?]

190
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:45,279
- Ji Hyo.
- Kang Gary.

191
00:10:47,048 --> 00:10:50,138
[Princess Ji Hyo chooses Team GD!]

192
00:10:53,769 --> 00:10:55,502
That's not fair!

193
00:10:56,478 --> 00:10:58,187
It's not Team Gary,
but it's Team G-Dragon.

194
00:10:58,188 --> 00:11:01,609
You'd better start dating for real
after all this.

195
00:11:04,014 --> 00:11:06,674
[Today's mission-
Steal Princess Ji Hyo's heart!]

196
00:11:07,912 --> 00:11:10,864
[Team GD rides off in style in the luxury car
with Princess Ji Hyo in the back.]

197
00:11:10,865 --> 00:11:12,941
I can't even stand to look
at them right now.

198
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:14,922
Then don't look.

199
00:11:15,263 --> 00:11:16,299
GD.

200
00:11:17,556 --> 00:11:18,848
- GD?
- Look at all those guys.

201
00:11:19,257 --> 00:11:22,184
We're riding in this car thanks to Gary.
Come on, Gary.

202
00:11:22,219 --> 00:11:25,448
[One having gotten them the victory,
Prince Gary.]

203
00:11:27,108 --> 00:11:28,402
Thank you.

204
00:11:30,698 --> 00:11:32,502
Wow, this is nice.

205
00:11:33,596 --> 00:11:37,296
- Isn't this a nice car?
- I hope we can continue to ride in this.

206
00:11:37,297 --> 00:11:39,924
[Will they be able to continue to ride
in this car to the end?]

207
00:11:40,301 --> 00:11:43,570
We're to go to a rice paddy field
in Ahnpyungri.

208
00:11:43,571 --> 00:11:45,192
What?
A rice paddy?

209
00:11:45,193 --> 00:11:47,208
[A rice paddy...]

210
00:11:48,306 --> 00:11:49,798
It's already steaming in the car.

211
00:11:49,799 --> 00:11:51,260
Ouch, the seat's so hot!

212
00:11:51,261 --> 00:11:53,499
Ugh, I'm already hot in this car.

213
00:11:54,705 --> 00:11:55,902
Ouch, that's hot!

214
00:11:56,763 --> 00:12:01,051
The outside air is actually cooler,
so let's just drive with the windows down.

215
00:12:01,052 --> 00:12:03,362
[Inside air being hotter than the outside air
is the classic car's special feature?]

216
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:06,430
Wow, that is some really hot air.

217
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:10,710
- It's much cooler to have the windows down.
- Yeah, it's much cooler outside.

218
00:12:10,711 --> 00:12:11,835
Ouch, that's hot!

219
00:12:11,836 --> 00:12:13,582
- That's hot!
- Are you okay?

220
00:12:13,968 --> 00:12:17,751
[Be cautious not to burn
your arm on the windowsill.]

221
00:12:17,752 --> 00:12:19,843
- You can't touch it with your leg either.
- I think I just burned my arm.

222
00:12:19,844 --> 00:12:21,381
- Princess Blank.
- Yes?

223
00:12:21,382 --> 00:12:23,710
We really want to be with you all day.

224
00:12:23,711 --> 00:12:26,278
- We're serious.
- He says he wants to as well.

225
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:29,158
- GD says he wants to as well.
- I really want to stay with you.

226
00:12:29,159 --> 00:12:31,215
[I don't want to ride in the other car.
I really want to stay with you.]

227
00:12:31,216 --> 00:12:33,557
- I get hot very easily.
- Really?

228
00:12:33,947 --> 00:12:36,946
[GD can't stand to be hot.
Worried about how he'd do in the classic car.]

229
00:12:36,947 --> 00:12:39,316
- He said that so timidly.
- I'll be really good to you.

230
00:12:39,317 --> 00:12:41,601
He says he gets hot really easily.

231
00:12:48,243 --> 00:12:52,241
[They all finally arrive
at their first location.]

232
00:12:54,028 --> 00:12:57,612
[The luxury sedan with the princess inside
also pulls up elegantly to the curb.]

233
00:12:58,436 --> 00:13:00,472
Time to get out of the car, Princess.

234
00:13:01,256 --> 00:13:02,943
Let me get the door for you.
Please allow me.

235
00:13:03,609 --> 00:13:05,152
Please watch your step.

236
00:13:05,153 --> 00:13:07,365
[Princess Blank has arrived.
Everyone bow down to her.]

237
00:13:07,366 --> 00:13:09,768
- Thank you.
- Please don't mention it.

238
00:13:10,383 --> 00:13:13,788
[Hat parasol-
G-Dragon protecting the princess' fair skin.]

239
00:13:13,789 --> 00:13:15,711
Does the air conditioner in your car work?

240
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:19,319
You guys can do better in the next round,
and find out in that car for yourselves.

241
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:22,012
We're not doing that for the car.
We'll be doing it for Ji Hyo.

242
00:13:22,013 --> 00:13:25,385
Of course.
[But...]

243
00:13:25,891 --> 00:13:28,779
[Not getting a very good feeling
about this place...]

244
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:30,406
This is...

245
00:13:32,094 --> 00:13:35,577
- What is all this?
- What's going on here?

246
00:13:36,591 --> 00:13:38,400
What is this?

247
00:13:39,313 --> 00:13:42,171
[Welcome to the rice paddy.]

248
00:13:42,672 --> 00:13:44,406
- They purposely filled this with water?
- Yes.

249
00:13:44,746 --> 00:13:48,165
- This is really something else.
- They've got something planned for us.

250
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:52,527
[In a few moments, the fiercest battle
in Running Man history will soon start.]

251
00:13:52,773 --> 00:13:55,890
<i>Her Highness, Princess Ji Hyo
will make her entrance.</i>

252
00:13:55,891 --> 00:13:57,374
<i>Please give her a round of applause.</i>

253
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:01,297
- Song Ji Hyo!
- Yeah!

254
00:14:07,078 --> 00:14:09,266
- I love you!
- Ji Hyo!

255
00:14:09,267 --> 00:14:13,695
[A red carpet event...
on top of the rice paddy.]

256
00:14:13,696 --> 00:14:15,711
- You look so beautiful!
- We love you!

257
00:14:15,712 --> 00:14:18,069
- It's an honor!
- I love you!

258
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:20,723
- Ji Hyo!
- I love you!

259
00:14:21,122 --> 00:14:23,070
- Ji Hyo!
- Ji Hyo!

260
00:14:23,071 --> 00:14:25,571
- Ji Hyo!
- Baby!

261
00:14:25,572 --> 00:14:27,932
[Everyone's calling out their own
term of endearment for her.]

262
00:14:27,933 --> 00:14:30,550
- Wait for me!
- Baby face!

263
00:14:30,551 --> 00:14:33,744
- Baby!
- Beautiful girl!

264
00:14:33,745 --> 00:14:37,061
- Baby girl!
- Beautiful girl!

265
00:14:37,062 --> 00:14:39,083
I can't live without you!

266
00:14:50,195 --> 00:14:53,144
[I won't let you beat me!
Crooning out to Ji Hyo.]

267
00:14:53,145 --> 00:14:57,923
<i>Because you're my girl!</i>

268
00:14:58,264 --> 00:15:00,914
- How can you say that she's your girl?
- Ji Hyo!

269
00:15:00,915 --> 00:15:03,210
- Ji Hyo!
- I feel like a 10 year old boy right now.

270
00:15:03,733 --> 00:15:07,025
[Big-nosed Brother's cutesy act making others
ball up their fists in embarrassment.]

271
00:15:07,575 --> 00:15:08,829
<i>Okay, everyone.</i>

272
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:11,010
<i>- Here's your first mission.
- What is it?</i>

273
00:15:11,253 --> 00:15:16,243
<i>Your first mission is...
gather up Princess Blank's flags.</i>

274
00:15:16,244 --> 00:15:19,351
[First mission-
Gather up Princess Blank's flags.]

275
00:15:19,352 --> 00:15:21,731
<i>As you can see, each team has
three flags placed in front of you.</i>

276
00:15:22,223 --> 00:15:27,231
<i>Each of you has to get one flag each
and return to the starting line</i>

277
00:15:27,232 --> 00:15:30,178
<i>and stick all three flags in the
stand that you see behind you.</i>

278
00:15:31,134 --> 00:15:32,666
<i>But...</i>

279
00:15:33,078 --> 00:15:36,407
<i>you are all aware of the rope that is used
to tie around you when you bungee jump?</i>

280
00:15:36,934 --> 00:15:41,216
<i>You will all be tied together with the rope
so that you have to work together as one.</i>

281
00:15:41,217 --> 00:15:43,023
[Everyone will be tied together so that
they're required to work together as one.]

282
00:15:43,024 --> 00:15:45,141
- What are you doing?
- We can do it without the rope.

283
00:15:45,599 --> 00:15:48,777
<i>This mission is more than possible if
you all just work together.</i>

284
00:15:48,778 --> 00:15:51,045
<i>We have done countless tests to ensure
that the mission is more than possible.</i>

285
00:15:51,045 --> 00:15:54,107
- Let's show them how strong we are.
- We're as strong as bulls!

286
00:15:54,452 --> 00:15:56,738
We will run our hardest with
only the princess in our thoughts!

287
00:15:56,739 --> 00:16:03,027
<i>What day is it today?
It's the day that we win.</i>

288
00:16:03,028 --> 00:16:07,859
- It's the say we win.
- Seung Ri! Ha! Ji! Cross!

289
00:16:09,781 --> 00:16:12,117
<i>Okay, everyone.
You've all been tied together with the rope.</i>

290
00:16:12,118 --> 00:16:13,999
[All the preparations are complete!]

291
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,074
<i>At the sound of
the whistle by the Princess...</i>

292
00:16:16,376 --> 00:16:19,015
The winning team gets to ride with me
in the nice car.

293
00:16:19,016 --> 00:16:22,324
[Only the winning team can move on to the next
location in the nice car with the princess.]

294
00:16:22,325 --> 00:16:23,604
We can do this!

295
00:16:23,605 --> 00:16:24,914
Ready!

296
00:16:24,915 --> 00:16:29,024
[Princess Blank's flag race.]

297
00:16:29,688 --> 00:16:31,396
[Let's go!]

298
00:16:43,942 --> 00:16:45,478
[Oh my God!]

299
00:16:45,479 --> 00:16:47,663
[Covered in mud as soon as
the race starts.]

300
00:16:48,581 --> 00:16:52,135
[Team Dae Sung in last place all thanks
to the Mud Kwang.]

301
00:16:55,289 --> 00:16:57,630
[Onward!]

302
00:16:58,208 --> 00:17:00,049
[The bungee cord starting to
drag them back.]

303
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:02,442
[And the muddy rice paddy field
sucking their feet into the ground.]

304
00:17:03,313 --> 00:17:06,955
[Just then, Mud Kwang races through
and starts pulling his team forward.]

305

[Giraffe dives to grab one of the flags.]

306
00:17:16,594 --> 00:17:19,987
What is this!
What am I reduced to doing!

307
00:17:23,441 --> 00:17:25,689
[Team GD also grabs one of their flags.]

308
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:27,997
[But...]

309
00:17:29,341 --> 00:17:33,653
[They automatically fall back from the
unbelievable strength of the bungee cord.]

310
00:17:39,995 --> 00:17:41,522
Someone help me!

311
00:17:44,616 --> 00:17:48,979
[Tries to get up...
just to fall back down on their behinds.]

312
00:17:51,999 --> 00:17:54,605
[Again!]

00:17:54,606 --> 00:17:57,381
[The stately prince's third crash.]

314
00:17:58,802 --> 00:18:02,082
[Meanwhile, there's Team Seung Ri,
who has yet to grab a single flag.]

315
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:03,635
Just a little bit more!

316
00:18:05,923 --> 00:18:07,204
Ji Hyo!

317
00:18:09,397 --> 00:18:12,376
[Team Seung Ri pulling on every ounce
of strength that they have.]

318
00:18:13,828 --> 00:18:16,039
[Gets their first flag!]

319
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:18,668
[And falls on their behinds
immediately afterward.]

320
00:18:19,893 --> 00:18:23,131
[An impressionable first greeting with
the rice paddy field.]

321
00:18:24,131 --> 00:18:25,665
What are you doing, GD?

322
00:18:27,117 --> 00:18:29,832
[Team GD and Team Dae Sung each completes
getting their first flag into the stand.]

for them at the same time.]

[Just then...]

[Team Dae Sung races full speed ahead!]

327
00:19:04,594 --> 00:19:10,554
[We won't be stopped!]

328
00:19:11,418 --> 00:19:14,740
[The bungee cord stretching long behind them.]

329
00:19:16,299 --> 00:19:18,744

with their monstrous strengths.]

[Only Mr. Capable is left
still standing on his feet.]

331
00:19:30,832 --> 00:19:32,229
[Our turn!]

332
00:19:37,784 --> 00:19:40,757
[Then Team GD gets down on all fours
to crawl the rest of their way.]

333
00:19:45,424 --> 00:19:47,670
[Team Dae Sung makes another attempt!]

334
00:19:54,465 --> 00:19:59,394
[Who will be first to get the second flag?
Team Dae Sung, or Team GD?]

335
00:20:05,179 --> 00:20:07,606
[Simultaneously!]

336
00:20:08,985 --> 00:20:12,273
[Even falls down... simultaneously!]

337
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,373
[Just then, Team Seung Ri
races their way forward!]

338
00:20:18,428 --> 00:20:22,108
[But they're looking the weakest
out of all three teams...]

339
00:20:27,252 --> 00:20:30,046
[Screams that can be heard
from all three of them.]

340
00:20:36,336 --> 00:20:40,152
[GD is getting a full on mud spa treatment.]

341
00:20:42,506 --> 00:20:45,542
Currently, both the Yellow Team and the
Red Team only has one more flag left to go.

342
00:20:45,543 --> 00:20:46,828
[Team Dae Sung vs. Team GD-
Only one more flag left to go for each team!]

343
00:20:46,829 --> 00:20:48,503
We can do this.
You can do this, right?

344
00:20:48,504 --> 00:20:50,065
- Let's do this!
- Let's win!

345
00:20:50,066 --> 00:20:52,586
- Ji Hyo! Make sure that you see this!
- Fighting!

346
00:20:53,715 --> 00:20:56,925
- We're going to win this for you!
- Start on the count of three, okay?

347
00:21:00,795 --> 00:21:05,489
[Princess... we're on our way!]

348
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:06,973
One, two, three!

349
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:09,461
Run!

350
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:14,325
[Screams of their battle cry that
can be heard throughout the rice paddy.]

351
00:21:17,352 --> 00:21:19,356
[The flag is right in front of their nose!]

352
00:21:20,274 --> 00:21:22,053
- We have to stop them!
- Just a little bit more!

353
00:21:23,422 --> 00:21:26,357
[If they can just get this flag,
the victory will be Team Dae Sung's!]

354
00:21:26,358 --> 00:21:28,264
- Ji Hyo!
- We have to stop Team Dae Sung!

355
00:21:28,265 --> 00:21:30,314
Pull!
Pull!

356
00:21:31,842 --> 00:21:35,161
[Desperately...]

357
00:21:35,162 --> 00:21:38,351
[Desperately...]

358
00:21:38,352 --> 00:21:39,654

[He grabbed the flag!]

362
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:07,891
[A fiery will for their princess!]

363
00:22:11,161 --> 00:22:12,656
Great job!

364
00:22:15,622 --> 00:22:17,986
[Team GD just needs one more...]

365
00:22:19,825 --> 00:22:21,427
Just leave me and go!

366
00:22:21,925 --> 00:22:25,504
[Save the soldier from the rice paddy...]

367
00:22:35,231 --> 00:22:38,300
[I want to go home...]

368
00:22:40,745 --> 00:22:43,517
[Team Dae Sung succeeds in getting
all three of their flags.]

369
00:22:43,977 --> 00:22:45,810
<i>Yellow Team wins!</i>

370
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:49,123
[Team Dae Sung wins!]

371
00:22:50,204 --> 00:22:53,455
- You have to scream out Ji Hyo's name.
- Yes, this is all for Ji Hyo.

372
00:22:54,193 --> 00:22:56,373
[Is that what you're supposed to do?]

373
00:22:56,374 --> 00:22:59,485
If it had been anyone else but Ji Hyo,
we wouldn't have been able to do this.

374
00:22:59,843 --> 00:23:02,972
[They're going a little overboard
with their fervor for Ji Hyo.]

375
00:23:03,671 --> 00:23:05,659
- Ji Hyo!
- Let's go!

376
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:07,863

You may all go back now.</i>

377

<i>First round is over.
The Yellow Team won.</i>

379
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:13,665
The first round?

380
00:23:14,702 --> 00:23:18,432
[You're saying that we have to
do this again?]

381
00:23:18,433 --> 00:23:20,243
- This is only the first round?
- How many rounds are there?

382
00:23:20,244 --> 00:23:23,121
<i>Congratulations to the Yellow Team.
You've won the first round.</i>

383
00:23:23,122 --> 00:23:27,003
[The scary truth that this was only
the end of the first round...]

384

[Start the race!]

392
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:51,984
[In a flurry of movement!]

393
00:23:52,889 --> 00:23:59,254
[No fear of the mud...
A battle between men for Princess Blank!]

394
00:24:01,054 --> 00:24:04,452

Much faster than the first round!]

395

to grab their flag.]

to get to their last flag!]

411
00:25:24,403 --> 00:25:27,708
[Big Bang...
with their teeth tightly gritted.]

412
00:25:30,089 --> 00:25:37,877
[Who will be the first...
to get to their Princess Blank's flag?]

413
00:25:42,065 --> 00:25:45,951
[All three teams grab their flags
by the split of a hair!]

414
00:25:47,447 --> 00:25:50,192

[A day like this may never come
to GD in his lifetime again...]

427
00:26:45,342 --> 00:26:48,156
- The two of us swam over here.
- You two looked very comfortable.

428

tied in first place.</i>

00:26:54,816 --> 00:26:59,465
<i>The first team to win two rounds
is the victor of this mission.</i>

431
00:26:59,755 --> 00:27:03,645
<i>Which means, if either the Yellow Team
or the Red Team wins one more round</i>

432
00:27:03,646 --> 00:27:05,153
<i>then the victor will be determined.</i>

433

What we want the most right now is
for the Blue Team to win this round.

434
00:27:08,734 --> 00:27:11,203
[Too much of a stretch
even just to imagine it.]

435
00:27:11,204 --> 00:27:13,134
- Let's just finish this right now.
- I can't even imagine that happening.

436
00:27:13,135 --> 00:27:14,602
I'm going to win this round!

437

- Dae Sung!
- Yes?

- I think I'm made to be a farmer.

439
00:27:19,993 --> 00:27:21,436
Yes, you're made to be a farmer.

and this can determine the winner.</i>

and we're going to go one more round.

- We're Big Bang.
- No!

443

after this one.

of this fierce battle ground?]

second flag at an amazing speed!]

and falls down to the ground.]

00:28:55,049 --> 00:28:57,437
[Team Dae Sung already gets their
second flag into their post.]

464
00:28:57,438 --> 00:28:59,036
Get it in there, Gary.

465
00:29:01,043 --> 00:29:02,449
[Stay strong.]

466

at that last crucial moment!]

[We'll get the flag...
even if it's the last thing we do!]

471

their flag back into the post!]

their final flag!]

Do you want to die?

485
00:30:32,083 --> 00:30:33,686
Why don't you give it a try?

[Team Seung Ri loses it,
and they take it out on Princess Blank.]

487

Why are you saying all that, Suk Jin?
Ji Hyo's our princess.

488
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:41,144
- We can't even serve her as our princess.
- You can't speak to Ji Hyo like that.

[The truth is, Princess Ji Hyo has kept a
secret trump card hidden with her all day.]

497
00:31:10,553 --> 00:31:14,758
<i>The cards are divided into Top, Middle,
and Bottom, according to their numbers.</i>

498
00:31:15,088 --> 00:31:18,005
<i>The team that came in at first place can
choose a card from the 'Top' level cards</i>

499
00:31:18,006 --> 00:31:21,554
<i>second place can choose from the middle
and the loser team can choose from the bottom.</i>

500
00:31:21,555 --> 00:31:25,325
- Is this how you're really going to do this?
- I actually think that this is really fair.

501
00:31:25,772 --> 00:31:27,874
What do you mean, it's a fair game?
This game was pretty much for you to win.

502
00:31:27,875 --> 00:31:33,692
[Princess Ji Hyo, who knows the numbers can't
aid them during their card selection process.]

503
00:31:33,693 --> 00:31:36,671
- Thank you, Princess.
- Allow me to kiss the top of your foot.

504
00:31:37,617 --> 00:31:42,134
[First place winner- Team Dae Sung.
Choose from the top level cards.]

505
00:31:43,036 --> 00:31:46,278
- Do we pick from this stack?
- You have to pick one of these cards.

506
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:49,510
- How about this one?
- The one in the middle?

507
00:31:49,511 --> 00:31:51,398
- How about this one?
- May we select this one?

508
00:31:56,385 --> 00:31:59,774
[Thanks to the gracious Princess Blank,
they've figured out where the high card is.]

509
00:31:59,775 --> 00:32:01,634
- Let's go with that one!
- Grab it!

510
00:32:01,635 --> 00:32:03,095
- Go on, Dae Sung.
- The middle one!

511
00:32:03,096 --> 00:32:04,641
The one in the middle!

512
00:32:04,642 --> 00:32:05,968
Really?

513
00:32:05,969 --> 00:32:08,707
[Which will it be?]

514
00:32:09,663 --> 00:32:12,664
[Team Dae Sung chooses number 9,
the highest number in the group!]

515
00:32:13,334 --> 00:32:16,293
[This is all thanks to Princess Ji Hyo!]

516
00:32:16,294 --> 00:32:18,139
You have to be good to me, Kwang Soo.

517
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:19,983
I'm really going to be good to you
from now on.

518
00:32:19,984 --> 00:32:21,685
I won't let him get away with it
if he doesn't.

519
00:32:22,461 --> 00:32:26,778
Even though GD's done other variety shows,
he's never experienced this before.

520
00:32:26,779 --> 00:32:29,607
- You all are so...
- We put everything we had in the battle.

521
00:32:29,608 --> 00:32:31,924
[Putting everything they had on the line
for their Princess Blank.]

522
00:32:31,925 --> 00:32:34,461
Did you see how GD's white teeth got stained
by the muddy water from the field earlier?

523
00:32:35,409 --> 00:32:38,495
- GD...
- With my warmest regards...

524
00:32:38,496 --> 00:32:40,721
[Second place winner- Team GD.
Must pick from the middle deck of cards.]

525
00:32:40,722 --> 00:32:42,489
- Six.
- Go on and choose.

526
00:32:45,210 --> 00:32:46,599
No.

527
00:32:49,705 --> 00:32:52,399
[Choosing their card under
the guidance of Princess Blank.]

528
00:32:53,421 --> 00:32:56,710
[As expected, they pick number 6,
the highest number from their deck!]

529
00:32:59,772 --> 00:33:02,815
- Keep working hard.
- Thank you, you're so beautiful.

530
00:33:04,331 --> 00:33:06,279
[And last, Team Seung Ri.]

531
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:09,690
- We can't even see, right?
- I really am a huge fan of Seung Ri's.

532
00:33:09,691 --> 00:33:11,595
We'll take number three.

533
00:33:11,596 --> 00:33:15,909
But what Ha Ha said earlier about
me having made up that game...

534
00:33:16,478 --> 00:33:19,614
I was just asking because it was such
an amazing idea of a game.

535
00:33:19,615 --> 00:33:21,286
- It was such a brilliant idea.
- He was out of his mind.

536
00:33:21,287 --> 00:33:23,100
I was just saying that it
was a good idea.

537
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:25,177
Please just look at
Seung Ri's innocent face.

538
00:33:26,176 --> 00:33:28,051
I just meant that it was a great game.
I'm serious.

539
00:33:28,052 --> 00:33:31,209
- It was a refreshing idea.
- We should play that game every week.

540
00:33:31,210 --> 00:33:33,570
- Let's play that game every week.
- Choose your card.

541
00:33:33,996 --> 00:33:36,072
I will try to be as nice as I can to you.

542
00:33:36,073 --> 00:33:37,711
[Bestowing her kindness upon them
for Seung Ri's sake.]

543
00:33:43,877 --> 00:33:46,096
- I saw that sweet smile on her face.
- She is so kind.

544
00:33:46,097 --> 00:33:49,638
[Which card did
Princess Blank direct them to?]

545
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:53,219
[The middle number, number two.]

546
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:55,503
One!

547
00:33:56,266 --> 00:33:59,927
- They want to be number 1, so give them one.
- Pretend that you're happy.

548
00:34:02,131 --> 00:34:05,053
As I always knew...
even your heart is so very beautiful.

549
00:34:06,807 --> 00:34:08,299
What a nice day today is.

550
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:11,854
I hope that every day will be like this.

551
00:34:21,667 --> 00:34:24,597
- Hey, hurry up and open the door for her.
- Hurry up and get the door open for her.

552
00:34:24,632 --> 00:34:26,875
- We're ready for you, Princess!
- We're ready!

553
00:34:26,876 --> 00:34:28,385
Step on me and get in the car!

554
00:34:28,386 --> 00:34:30,759
Step on Kwang Soo.
Use Kwang Soo as a step to get in the car.

555
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,709
There you go.
Okay.

556
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:34,283
That was good.

557
00:34:34,284 --> 00:34:36,415
I can't believe you really
stepped on me.

558
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:38,393
- Why wouldn't she?
- You told me to step on you!

559
00:34:44,257 --> 00:34:46,664
[Princess Ji Hyo's camera falls
down to the ground!]

560
00:34:46,665 --> 00:34:48,575
- Kwang Soo, her camera...
- Yes.

561
00:34:48,576 --> 00:34:50,081
I'll film her myself.

562
00:34:50,082 --> 00:34:53,217
You look very beautiful at this angle.

563
00:34:53,218 --> 00:34:55,387
[What are you filming?
Don't play with me!]

564
00:34:57,205 --> 00:34:59,167
- Kwang Soo.
- Can you switch seats with me?

565
00:34:59,168 --> 00:35:02,408
- Come on, switch seats with me.
- Stop it, Kwang Soo.

566
00:35:02,409 --> 00:35:03,847
Why are you doing that?

567
00:35:03,848 --> 00:35:05,809
You have to take good care of her.

568
00:35:05,810 --> 00:35:09,136
- Aren't you even afraid of the consequences?
- Seriously. Do it right.

569
00:35:09,171 --> 00:35:11,658
Stop filming yourself, and film me.

570
00:35:11,659 --> 00:35:13,957
Don't film yourself.

571
00:35:14,381 --> 00:35:16,638
Isn't this car so much better
than the other one?

572
00:35:16,639 --> 00:35:18,255
- Yes, it's much nicer.
- Yes.

573
00:35:18,672 --> 00:35:22,521
Princess, as long as you're with us,
don't even think about doing any walking.

574
00:35:22,522 --> 00:35:25,365
Do you know what
the final mission is going to be?

575
00:35:25,366 --> 00:35:28,042
Of course she would know everything.
There's nothing that she doesn't know.

576
00:35:28,042 --> 00:35:31,062
Even if she doesn't know,
whatever she says will become the law.

577
00:35:31,063 --> 00:35:32,511
Of course, that's a given.

578
00:35:32,512 --> 00:35:35,396
- Of course, she's the princess.
- Yes, you're right.

579
00:35:35,397 --> 00:35:37,332
Dae Sung is very good at
serving the princess.

580
00:35:37,333 --> 00:35:38,859
- Of course.
- He's very good at serving someone.

581
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:40,581
I'm a caretaker by nature.

582
00:35:42,285 --> 00:35:44,762
I'm known as the caretaker
amongst all the Idols.

583
00:35:44,897 --> 00:35:49,198
How did that camera ever get so lucky to
be filming you like this right now?

584
00:35:50,634 --> 00:35:53,795
- Wow, that is one lucky camera.
- I really can't do this.

585
00:35:54,473 --> 00:35:58,318
- Dae Sung's really good at things like that.
- I told you that I'm a known caretaker!

586
00:35:58,319 --> 00:36:00,194
- Dae Sung's very good at this stuff.
- Seriously.

587
00:36:01,591 --> 00:36:05,506
[Team GD having being downgraded from
the luxury sedan to the classic car.]

588
00:36:06,388 --> 00:36:09,002
That first game was way too tough.

589
00:36:09,003 --> 00:36:13,255
- You were laughing the whole time.
- I was laughing while I cleaned up too.

590
00:36:13,256 --> 00:36:14,576
He was probably delirious.

591
00:36:14,577 --> 00:36:18,152
You know why he's laughing?
It's because he can't believe what happened.

592
00:36:18,153 --> 00:36:20,111
He was laughing out of disbelief
the whole time.

593
00:36:21,259 --> 00:36:23,247
[Coming up to a toll.]

594
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:31,415
[He takes the toll ticket,
and sticks it up in the visor...]

595
00:36:37,539 --> 00:36:40,502
[The toll ticket flies out the window!]

596
00:36:44,195 --> 00:36:45,479
Hey.

597
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:47,217
The ticket flew out the window.

598
00:36:47,218 --> 00:36:49,762
[Driving with the windows down...]

599
00:36:49,763 --> 00:36:51,042
Did it fly away out the window?

600
00:36:51,043 --> 00:36:55,470
[How could something like this
have happened?]

601
00:36:55,471 --> 00:36:58,450
- What do we do, Gary?
- I can't believe we lost our ticket.

602
00:36:58,451 --> 00:37:00,024
What do we do now?

603
00:37:00,025 --> 00:37:05,107
[Just what else awaits this team today?]

604
00:37:07,997 --> 00:37:10,910
[Second mission location-
'D' Gas station in Gyunggido.]

605
00:37:11,497 --> 00:37:12,968
Where?
Where am I going?

606
00:37:12,969 --> 00:37:14,917
[Making a noisy entrance with
Princess Blank in his arms.]

607
00:37:16,145 --> 00:37:18,769
- Carpet! Carpet!
- Put down the red carpet!

608
00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:20,915
- Put down the red carpet!
- Quickly!

609
00:37:20,916 --> 00:37:22,223
[Rushing to roll down the red carpet.]

610
00:37:22,224 --> 00:37:24,881
- Hurry!
- Unroll it quickly!

611
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:27,941
- Faster!
- Get it down!

612
00:37:27,942 --> 00:37:29,742
- We're all set!
- Let's go.

613
00:37:30,215 --> 00:37:33,235
[After all the loud fanfare,
Princess finally makes her entrance.]

614
00:37:33,236 --> 00:37:35,952
- Please use me as your step.
- But the chair is over there.

615
00:37:37,306 --> 00:37:38,993
We have to roll this back up!

616
00:37:40,087 --> 00:37:42,527
[Dae Sung truly is a caretaker specialist.]

617
00:37:42,528 --> 00:37:45,073
We have to make sure
that the princess is comfortable.

618
00:37:45,074 --> 00:37:47,784
Move it.
Move!

619
00:37:48,130 --> 00:37:51,182
Princess.
You're looking beautiful as always.

620
00:37:51,183 --> 00:37:52,846
[Team GD follows right behind them,
and enters like a group of gentlemen.]

621
00:37:52,846 --> 00:37:54,988
Princess Ji Hyo, have you had your lunch?

622
00:37:58,664 --> 00:38:00,781
What do I do if that becomes a habit?

623
00:38:00,782 --> 00:38:02,808
[Will it become a habit?]

624
00:38:03,792 --> 00:38:05,888
Go ahead and soak it up.
You've only got today.

625
00:38:05,889 --> 00:38:07,390
I know that it's just for today.

626
00:38:08,205 --> 00:38:11,767
Your next mission is,
Princess Ji Hyo's everything.

627
00:38:11,768 --> 00:38:14,033
[Second mission-
Princess Ji Hyo's everything.]

628
00:38:14,034 --> 00:38:15,793
- There's nothing I don't know about Ji Hyo.
- I know everything about her.

629
00:38:15,794 --> 00:38:18,100
- You know what's to know about her.
- Yes, I know enough too.

630
00:38:18,101 --> 00:38:19,606
You know everything, don't you?

631
00:38:19,607 --> 00:38:21,469
Ji Hyo and I go to the same hair salon.

632
00:38:21,470 --> 00:38:24,896
I even know all the movies,
and dramas that she's ever been in.

633
00:38:25,906 --> 00:38:28,091
We're her number one fans.

634
00:38:28,537 --> 00:38:30,653
57.8 kg.

635
00:38:31,762 --> 00:38:33,427
57.8 kg.

636
00:38:34,984 --> 00:38:37,031
- You're in big trouble now.
- What are you saying?

637
00:38:37,032 --> 00:38:39,856
You know what he means when
he says, 57.8 kg?

638
00:38:39,857 --> 00:38:41,807
Why do you keep doing this to me?

639
00:38:41,808 --> 00:38:43,790
[Has Kwang Soo forgotten how
generous Princess Blank was to his team?]

640
00:38:43,790 --> 00:38:47,677
- 42.4.
- People are going to believe 57.8 kg is real.

641
00:38:47,987 --> 00:38:50,020
Then are you saying that you're not?

642
00:38:51,105 --> 00:38:53,990
- We'll take care of him.
- I'm sorry!

643
00:38:53,991 --> 00:38:55,601
[Finally realizing what he's done.]

644
00:38:55,602 --> 00:38:57,379
- It's over for you now.
- I'm sorry.

645
00:38:57,380 --> 00:39:01,655
Unless you send him away to another team,
you won't see another good card again.

646
00:39:01,656 --> 00:39:04,399
Or another option for you would be to
leave him behind at this gas station.

647
00:39:05,256 --> 00:39:07,512
[Hateful Giraffe...
What are you going to do now?]

648
00:39:07,513 --> 00:39:10,998
<i>We're going to be asking you questions
that are related to Princess Ji Hyo.</i>

649
00:39:10,999 --> 00:39:13,100
<i>All three of the teams will
have to run out</i>

650
00:39:13,101 --> 00:39:16,797
<i>and find something that is relatable
to the question that is being asked.</i>

651
00:39:16,798 --> 00:39:18,614
So there are things hidden
throughout this place?

652
00:39:18,615 --> 00:39:20,180
[Go find the answer to the questions
that are being asked!]

653
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:21,341
We can win this one.

654
00:39:21,341 --> 00:39:23,257
[Team Seung Ri's confident in their skills
as long as it's not something physical?]

655
00:39:23,258 --> 00:39:24,607
<i>- Okay, here's your first question.
- Yes.</i>

656
00:39:25,061 --> 00:39:29,067
<i>This gas station is our country's
largest gas station.</i>

657
00:39:29,657 --> 00:39:38,366
<i>You have to go and bring back the food
that Princess Ji Hyo is craving the most.</i>

658
00:39:40,132 --> 00:39:44,325
[A huge selection of food to choose from
since it's the largest gas station.]

659
00:39:45,927 --> 00:39:50,103
[Just what is the menu item that
Princess Ji Hyo craves the most?]

660
00:39:50,104 --> 00:39:51,949
I know what kind of food Ji Hyo likes.

661
00:39:51,950 --> 00:39:53,394
I know.
I know exactly what she wants.

662
00:39:53,395 --> 00:39:55,732
It's nice to be on Gary's team
when it comes to things like this.

663
00:39:56,088 --> 00:39:59,227
Ji Hyo, do you want the same thing
that we shared together last week?

664
00:39:59,846 --> 00:40:02,485
- You know what I'm talking about.
- So you two meet on your own privately?

665
00:40:04,084 --> 00:40:08,126
[Just what is the menu item that she's
craving the most from this place?]

666
00:40:08,127 --> 00:40:09,486
Okay, ready.

667
00:40:09,844 --> 00:40:11,797
- Go!
- Being fast isn't necessarily good.

668
00:40:11,798 --> 00:40:14,724
[The first team to bring back the food
that she wants the most wins!]

669
00:40:14,725 --> 00:40:16,498
- Why are you saying that it isn't good?
- Being fastest isn't always the best.

670
00:40:16,499 --> 00:40:18,753
- Think about it carefully.
- We have to hurry!

671
00:40:19,091 --> 00:40:22,421
Since she's hot right now, she
wants something cool and refreshing.

672
00:40:22,422 --> 00:40:24,160
- Patbingsoo.
- Yeah, she'd like patbingsoo.

673
00:40:24,161 --> 00:40:26,406
And she loves waffles.

674
00:40:26,407 --> 00:40:28,386
She loves sweet rice donuts.

675
00:40:28,387 --> 00:40:33,295
- Or... she also likes steamed potatoes.
- Let's go with the potatoes.

676
00:40:33,295 --> 00:40:36,450
Because whenever we stop by a gas station,
Ji Hyo always gets steamed potatoes.

677
00:40:36,824 --> 00:40:41,284
- Ji Hyo really likes Korean style food.
- You're right. She's Korean food all the way.

678
00:40:41,924 --> 00:40:45,310
- You don't think she'd want Chinese?
- No, definitely not Chinese.

679
00:40:45,311 --> 00:40:47,278
- She definitely doesn't want Chinese.
- Let's go this way.

680
00:40:47,956 --> 00:40:50,665
[Finally enters the restaurant area.]

681
00:40:50,666 --> 00:40:52,403
- Let's get her nangmyun.
- Hurry!

682
00:40:52,872 --> 00:40:55,901
[Team Seung Ri decides on nangmyun!]

683
00:40:58,329 --> 00:41:00,125
Hello.

684
00:41:03,848 --> 00:41:05,943
The water nangmyun.
Let's get her the water nangmyun.

685
00:41:05,944 --> 00:41:08,207
[Team GD also decides
to get her the nangmyun.]

686
00:41:08,208 --> 00:41:09,578
We have to buy it quickly.

687
00:41:09,613 --> 00:41:11,077
Princess!

688
00:41:11,454 --> 00:41:13,986
- We've brought you the menu item you wanted!
- We got it for you!

689
00:41:13,987 --> 00:41:16,591
- It's your favorite steamed potatoes!
- You have to wait.

690
00:41:17,493 --> 00:41:20,316
- You want us to wait?
- Lee Kwang Soo, you wait.

691
00:41:20,317 --> 00:41:24,497
- Wait, she told you to wait!
- Get Lee Kwang Soo far away from me.

692
00:41:24,498 --> 00:41:25,757
[Get Lee Kwang Soo
far away from her as possible.]

693
00:41:25,758 --> 00:41:27,696
[Removing him right away.]

694
00:41:27,697 --> 00:41:30,370
- I'll just call you when we're back in Seoul.
- Why back in Seoul?

695
00:41:32,171 --> 00:41:33,514
- Nangmyun?
- Yes, nangmyun.

696
00:41:33,515 --> 00:41:37,113
[Both Team GD and Team Seung Ri
are waiting for their order of nangmyun.]

697
00:41:37,114 --> 00:41:38,986
They're making ours right now.

698
00:41:39,908 --> 00:41:42,253
Please make it nice and cold.

699
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:44,668
Ma'am.

700
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:47,008
Can you give us two orders
of nangmyun?

701
00:41:49,673 --> 00:41:52,559
- You have to wait for your turn.
- Okay.

702
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,200
You have to wait for your turn.

703
00:41:54,201 --> 00:41:56,712
[It's down to which team's nangmyun
will come out first...]

704
00:41:56,713 --> 00:41:58,953
[Only one bowl of nangmyun is out!]

705
00:42:00,063 --> 00:42:02,021
Go away!

706
00:42:03,134 --> 00:42:05,735
[Both teams arguing that it's theirs
and starting a tug-of-war!]

707
00:42:05,736 --> 00:42:07,339
You guys can't do this!

708
00:42:08,423 --> 00:42:10,870
[Just then, another bowl comes out!]

709
00:42:12,766 --> 00:42:15,511
[Which team will be first to
serve their bowl to Princess Blank?]

710
00:42:16,270 --> 00:42:18,423
[GD takes the bowl and runs!]

711
00:42:23,063 --> 00:42:25,966
[Team Seung Ri is right on his tail!]

712
00:42:30,294 --> 00:42:33,177
[Princess Blank, your nangmyun is coming!]

713
00:42:38,232 --> 00:42:40,576
[Team Seung Ri's nangmyun arrives!]

714
00:42:41,262 --> 00:42:43,981
[Even though it spilled onto the tray a bit,
it was a speedy delivery!]

715
00:42:43,982 --> 00:42:46,431
But we got it for you quickly!

716
00:42:46,616 --> 00:42:47,955
We forgot the chopsticks!

717
00:42:47,956 --> 00:42:49,879
[They forgot to grab
the chopsticks in their haste...]

718
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:51,851
- What happened?
- They forgot their chopsticks.

719
00:42:51,852 --> 00:42:55,673
This is so unfair, Princess Ji Hyo.
We got here first.

720
00:42:55,674 --> 00:42:57,408
Get back here!

721
00:42:58,707 --> 00:43:01,289
Why do you always become such a jerk
whenever you're on Running Man?

722
00:43:01,813 --> 00:43:03,789
- Get back here!
- What happens to you on this show?

723
00:43:04,109 --> 00:43:06,558
Why do you become such a jerk
when you're on this show?

724
00:43:06,559 --> 00:43:07,811
You have to get out of the way!

725
00:43:07,812 --> 00:43:11,187
[Princess Blank enjoying her
bowl of nangmyun.]

726
00:43:11,188 --> 00:43:14,381
- What are you guys doing?
- Can you try our potato?

727
00:43:14,382 --> 00:43:15,846
- She already tried it.
- I had some.

728
00:43:15,847 --> 00:43:17,453
Didn't you even see me eating it?

729
00:43:18,024 --> 00:43:20,120
Just don't even open your mouth!

730
00:43:20,121 --> 00:43:21,372
Keep your mouth shut!

731
00:43:21,373 --> 00:43:22,952
What's wrong with you?

732
00:43:22,953 --> 00:43:25,570
Kwang Soo, you should just grab
a bus back to Seoul.

733
00:43:26,286 --> 00:43:29,348
[That's the best way for you
to help your team...]

734
00:43:30,781 --> 00:43:37,389
We have seen Princess Ji Hyo enjoying this
steamed potato many a times.

735
00:43:37,390 --> 00:43:40,065
We thought that she'd enjoy eating
something simple such as this.

736
00:43:40,066 --> 00:43:41,600
Yes, the potato.

737
00:43:41,601 --> 00:43:48,597
[Could the steamed potato really be what
Princess Blank is craving?]

738
00:43:50,722 --> 00:43:52,894
[Team Dae Sung's steamed potato-
The wrong answer.]

739
00:43:52,895 --> 00:43:54,502
You guys are totally wrong.
Get out of the way.

740
00:43:54,503 --> 00:43:56,551
[Team Seung Ri immediately followed
by serving her their nangmyun.]

741
00:43:56,552 --> 00:43:58,592
We were faster, and they cheated.

742
00:43:58,593 --> 00:44:00,975
[Team GD and Team Seung Ri
both brought her the nangmyun.]

743
00:44:00,976 --> 00:44:03,867
But they spilled their nangmyun
all over their tray.

744
00:44:03,868 --> 00:44:07,605
- They cheated.
- Nangmyun is best on a hot day like this.

745
00:44:07,606 --> 00:44:10,462
If nangmyun is the correct answer,
will you choose between the two nangmyuns?

746
00:44:10,463 --> 00:44:13,185
Okay, I will.
Then both teams, go back and redo it.

747
00:44:13,186 --> 00:44:15,070
- It's not this either?
- No, this isn't it either.

748
00:44:15,071 --> 00:44:17,297
[Team GD and Team Seung Ri-
Nangmyun is not the correct answer.]

749
00:44:17,298 --> 00:44:19,151
She will choose one person that she likes
to give a hint to.

750
00:44:19,152 --> 00:44:22,288
[Princess Blank will choose one person to
give a hint to as to what she wants.]

751
00:44:22,289 --> 00:44:25,352
[If they want to receive the hint,
they have to earn her favor...]

752
00:44:25,353 --> 00:44:27,250
- I've repented for my behavior.
- Princess.

753
00:44:28,477 --> 00:44:32,877
[G-Dragon putting on his best
cutesy act for the princess.]

754
00:44:36,086 --> 00:44:37,394
What are you doing?

755
00:44:38,014 --> 00:44:39,895
That's cheating!

756
00:44:39,896 --> 00:44:42,425
- What are you doing?
- You can't do that!

757
00:44:42,426 --> 00:44:44,663
[Even just gazing upon her
has a powerful effect.]

758
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:48,703
[Thanks to GD's cutesy act,
Team GD earns themselves a hint.]

759
00:44:48,704 --> 00:44:50,408
There you go again telling me
how much you love me.

760
00:44:50,409 --> 00:44:53,019
Just tell me the hint.
I already know that you love me.

761
00:44:53,020 --> 00:44:55,665
These two really are cracking me up lately.

762
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,744
- It's red.
- Come on, hurry!

763
00:44:57,745 --> 00:44:59,332
- What is it?
- It's ddukbokki.

764
00:45:00,190 --> 00:45:02,718
[Hearing her say the word, 'red'
has him running off to buy her ddukbokki.]

765
00:45:02,719 --> 00:45:04,072
Hurry!
Come on, hurry!

766
00:45:04,073 --> 00:45:06,645
Come on, Jae Suk!
Where is it?

767
00:45:06,646 --> 00:45:14,215
[Red in color- The item
that she wants the most is...]

768
00:45:14,216 --> 00:45:17,648
[The correct answer is, Jjamppong.]

769
00:45:19,256 --> 00:45:24,272
[The gas station food item she wants
the most is, jjamppong.]

770
00:45:25,941 --> 00:45:27,281
Princess!

771
00:45:27,979 --> 00:45:30,997
- Princess!
- What is it? I can't see what it is.

772
00:45:31,410 --> 00:45:33,656
[Ah... ddukbokki...]

773
00:45:33,657 --> 00:45:35,618
It's red in color!

774
00:45:36,111 --> 00:45:38,379
Red in color, wrong!

775
00:45:39,463 --> 00:45:42,758
[To run off so single mindedly like that
without even thinking about it first...]

776
00:45:44,774 --> 00:45:46,482
It's a noodle dish.

777
00:45:46,987 --> 00:45:48,300
I gave you all my hints.

778
00:45:48,301 --> 00:45:52,188
[Red in color, and a noodle dish.
Can they figure it out this time?]

779
00:45:52,189 --> 00:45:54,128
- I think it's jjamppong. A noodle dish.
- Really?

780
00:45:54,129 --> 00:45:56,848
[Oh... Gary's quick to figure it out.]

781
00:45:56,849 --> 00:45:58,006
- Jjamppong?
- Yeah.

782
00:45:58,420 --> 00:46:00,532
Jjamppong?

783
00:46:00,676 --> 00:46:04,249
[Team Seung Ri brings back
buckwheat noodles.]

784
00:46:04,250 --> 00:46:06,306
- Oh no!
- This isn't it?

785
00:46:06,307 --> 00:46:08,900
- I'm sorry, but this isn't it.
- Why are you so picky?

786
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,826
[Oh yeah?]

787
00:46:11,827 --> 00:46:14,882
- No hint for you.
- He was just kidding.

788
00:46:14,883 --> 00:46:16,276
I'm so sorry.

789
00:46:17,104 --> 00:46:19,905
- We want to know.
- It's red.

790
00:46:21,557 --> 00:46:23,233
Ramyun?
Jjamppong?

791
00:46:26,948 --> 00:46:28,699
- It's jjamppong.
- It's jjamppong, isn't it?

792
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:30,781
[It seems as though Team Seung Ri
has also figured it out!]

793
00:46:30,782 --> 00:46:32,342
Let's just go with jjamppong.

794
00:46:32,343 --> 00:46:34,374
If we have to come back,
might as well be quick.

795
00:46:34,375 --> 00:46:35,598
- Jjamppong?
- Yes, jjamppong.

796
00:46:35,928 --> 00:46:37,036
China.

797
00:46:38,686 --> 00:46:40,656
- China?
- Jjajangmyun in this weather?

798
00:46:41,180 --> 00:46:43,035
China.
It's one or the other.

799
00:46:43,358 --> 00:46:46,612
[One or the other?
Main representative Chinese dish.]

800
00:46:47,402 --> 00:46:49,739
- Ji Hyo likes jjamppong.
- Yeah, she loves jjamppong.

801
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:51,823
- She likes jjamppong.
- Doesn't she prefer jjajangmyun?

802
00:46:51,824 --> 00:46:54,501
[Even though they eat together often,
they're getting confused all of a sudden.]

803
00:46:55,248 --> 00:46:58,559
- You have to give it to us first.
- No, give it to us at the same time.

804
00:47:00,939 --> 00:47:02,725
You're the best!

805
00:47:04,212 --> 00:47:06,279
I'm sorry, but please keep your eyes forward.

806
00:47:08,655 --> 00:47:10,135
- Ma'am!
- Make it look pretty.

807
00:47:11,559 --> 00:47:13,637
We don't need all that.

808
00:47:15,169 --> 00:47:17,553
- Hurry! We were first!
- Give us ours first!

809
00:47:17,554 --> 00:47:20,658
[Which team will get it first?]

810
00:47:22,156 --> 00:47:24,154
[Sensible enough to give it to the
two teams at the same time!]

811
00:47:24,838 --> 00:47:27,285
[It's now all down to
a matter of speedy delivery!]

812
00:47:27,286 --> 00:47:28,560
Hurry!

813
00:47:30,594 --> 00:47:32,704
[That's it!]

814
00:47:34,636 --> 00:47:37,800
[Team GD's Jae Suk succeeds
in blocking their path.]

815
00:47:40,185 --> 00:47:43,139
[Team GD takes that opportunity
to take the lead!]

816
00:47:44,310 --> 00:47:50,702
[Thanks to Jae Suk's interference,
Team Seung Ri's in danger!]

817
00:47:53,572 --> 00:47:57,410
[Team GD ultimately serves their
bowl of jjamppong first.]

818
00:47:57,411 --> 00:47:59,644
They keep following us and
doing what we do.

819
00:47:59,645 --> 00:48:02,215
- Why do you keep copying us?
- No, we got our own hint.

820
00:48:03,508 --> 00:48:06,201
[Team Seung Ri is one step late
in serving up their bowl.]

821
00:48:06,202 --> 00:48:08,137
Why do we keep doing this?

822
00:48:11,423 --> 00:48:13,675
[Feeding her a spoonful of
broth to start out with first.]

823
00:48:14,412 --> 00:48:17,287
- She tried ours first.
- You won't leave her side.

824
00:48:17,288 --> 00:48:20,545
Princess!
We got the combo that you wanted!

825
00:48:20,723 --> 00:48:22,626
- Your combo!
- Here's your combo!

826
00:48:22,627 --> 00:48:25,151
[Team Dae Sung- Here's your combo.]

827
00:48:25,152 --> 00:48:27,441
- The combo is the best!
- Why don't you give ours a try?

828
00:48:27,442 --> 00:48:29,425
[Unsure of which dish to pick,
they decide to go with both.]

829
00:48:30,218 --> 00:48:31,961
[That's pretty smart.]

830
00:48:32,887 --> 00:48:34,967
First, thank you everyone for your efforts.

831
00:48:35,234 --> 00:48:37,264
- The food that I like is...
- Yes?

832
00:48:37,265 --> 00:48:39,488
Combo, combo, combo!

833
00:48:39,489 --> 00:48:41,605
- Jjamppong.
- Jjamppong!

834
00:48:41,606 --> 00:48:43,577
[The correct answer is, jjamppong!]

835
00:48:45,509 --> 00:48:47,531
Red Team wins one point.

836
00:48:47,532 --> 00:48:49,645
[Team GD wins themselves a point
for being the first to deliver.]

837
00:48:52,909 --> 00:48:55,178
<i>- Okay, here's your next question.
- Okay.</i>

838
00:48:55,207 --> 00:48:59,456
<i>If you look behind you
at this gas station...</i>

839
00:48:59,457 --> 00:49:02,952
<i>there's a playground where
you can bring your dog to play.</i>

840
00:49:03,822 --> 00:49:07,169
<i>There are a total of ten different
types of dogs in there right now.</i>

841
00:49:07,663 --> 00:49:09,860
<i>They are all different breeds of dogs.</i>

842
00:49:09,861 --> 00:49:15,726
<i>Princess Ji Hyo is going to choose the dog
that she likes the most out of that bunch.</i>

843
00:49:15,727 --> 00:49:20,536
<i>So all the men have to guess which
breed it is that she likes the best</i>

844
00:49:20,537 --> 00:49:23,052
<i>and you have to bring that
dog back here.</i>

845
00:49:26,285 --> 00:49:29,069
Isn't it the one that's already here?
'Gae'? (Gae means Dog)

846
00:49:32,650 --> 00:49:36,897
[Which breed is Ji Hyo's favorite?]

847
00:49:36,898 --> 00:49:38,492
<i>Okay, everyone turn around.</i>

848
00:49:38,493 --> 00:49:43,006
<i>Princess Ji Hyo already made her choice.
She chose her favorite dog.</i>

849
00:49:43,041 --> 00:49:46,016
<i>Go!
One dog per person!</i>

850
00:49:46,017 --> 00:49:49,609
It's possible that Ji Hyo doesn't know
the names of the different types of breeds.

851
00:49:49,610 --> 00:49:51,358
See?
There's even a bulldog.

852
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:54,030
It's possible that Ji Hyo might like
a dog that's rather on the uglier side.

853
00:49:54,031 --> 00:49:56,174
- Yeah, you're right.
- Ugly, yet cute.

854
00:49:56,175 --> 00:50:00,239

get these dogs easily, didn't you?]

over the place.]

[Please stop!]

862

Come over here.

863
00:50:27,368 --> 00:50:28,860
What about this one?

864
00:50:31,098 --> 00:50:32,557
Are there any treats around here?

865
00:50:34,987 --> 00:50:36,922
Okay, come over here.

866
00:50:36,923 --> 00:50:38,765

[G-Dragon chooses a sleek poodle.]

00:51:13,249 --> 00:51:15,809
Did you pick a fashionable dog
because you're a fashionista?

878
00:51:15,810 --> 00:51:18,151
- Don't most women like poodles?
- That's a poodle?

879
00:51:18,152 --> 00:51:20,848
- Why is it so big?
- Look at all the hair on its butt.

880
00:51:22,299 --> 00:51:23,954
That's the one!

881
00:51:23,955 --> 00:51:27,065

Gary so much?

confident now.

- I see something floating on the water.

982
00:56:46,542 --> 00:56:48,696
- Ugh, the water's so cold!
- It's cold?

983
00:56:48,697 --> 00:56:50,209
The water's cold?

984
00:56:52,957 --> 00:56:57,897
[Huh? They're walking on water?]

985
00:56:59,027 --> 00:57:00,629
That's so amazing.

986
00:57:00,630 --> 00:57:03,411
How is it possible that a human being
can walk on that thin little mat?

987
00:57:03,868 --> 00:57:09,622
[This is the fascinating water mat
that floats on top of the water.]

988
00:57:09,623 --> 00:57:11,476
Come one everyone.

989
00:57:12,737 --> 00:57:14,284
Seung Ri.

990
00:57:14,285 --> 00:57:16,076
What's wrong?
Come on in.

991
00:57:17,587 --> 00:57:20,291
[Unable to find his balance and falls in.]

992
00:57:22,923 --> 00:57:25,644
[Even though they're all wavering,
they're able to remain standing.]

993
00:57:25,941 --> 00:57:29,007
<i>Thank you all for waiting patiently.
Here comes Princess Song Ji Hyo.</i>

994
00:57:29,541 --> 00:57:32,979
[Princess Ji Hyo makes her entrance.]

995
00:57:39,222 --> 00:57:40,952
This is going to end today, right?

996
00:57:43,325 --> 00:57:45,616
She's not going to get a single one
of her toes wet today, is she?

997
00:57:46,272 --> 00:57:48,683
[Blank Ji is having a hard time getting
used to her treatment today as well.]

998
00:57:52,972 --> 00:57:55,854
[I'm Princess Ji Hyo.]

999
00:57:55,855 --> 00:57:57,847
- You look beautiful.
- You really do look pretty.

1000
00:58:01,042 --> 00:58:06,475
<i>This game is called,
'Serve Princess Blank Your Rose'.</i>

1001
00:58:06,476 --> 00:58:10,811
<i>There are three people per team.
Three people must take turns</i>

1002
00:58:10,812 --> 00:58:16,263
<i>and they'll have to jump rope a total
of 30 times from where Dae Sung is sitting.</i>

1003
00:58:16,264 --> 00:58:18,396
- On this mat?
- Yes, a combination of 30.

1004
00:58:18,397 --> 00:58:25,302
<i>Once you've completed all 30 jump ropes,
one person will run down the length of the mat</i>

1005
00:58:25,303 --> 00:58:27,416
<i>with a rose in their hand for the princess</i>

1006
00:58:27,417 --> 00:58:30,353
<i>and they'll have to jump and
throw their rose to Princess Blank.</i>

1007
00:58:30,617 --> 00:58:36,326
<i>Once the rose is thrown, Princess Blank will
catch the rose if she likes that person.</i>

1008
00:58:36,327 --> 00:58:38,656
<i>Or she can avoid catching
the rose as well.</i>

1009
00:58:39,658 --> 00:58:41,395
I love you, Princess!

1010
00:58:41,783 --> 00:58:44,623
You should've told us from the beginning
that there was going to be a game like this.

1011
00:58:45,170 --> 00:58:49,354
Wow, today really is...
today really is a great day for me.

1012
00:58:49,355 --> 00:58:56,003
<i>The total time that you have to get the
flower into Princess Blank's basket is...</i>

1013
00:58:56,317 --> 00:58:57,639
<i>one minute.</i>

1014
00:58:58,032 --> 00:59:00,981
- We're ruined because of Kwang Soo.
- Why?

1015
00:59:00,982 --> 00:59:04,087
<i>You have to complete your 30
jump ropes within that minute</i>

1016
00:59:04,088 --> 00:59:06,948
<i>and all the members have to
participate in the jump roping.</i>

1017
00:59:07,549 --> 00:59:09,582
<i>Okay, we will now start the game.</i>

1018
00:59:09,583 --> 00:59:10,864
Okay!

1019
00:59:11,177 --> 00:59:13,705
[Mission- Start.]

1020
00:59:13,706 --> 00:59:16,430
[Team Dae Sung to take the first turn.]

1021
00:59:19,919 --> 00:59:22,358
[This is the water float jump roping.]

1022
00:59:24,923 --> 00:59:27,445
[I bet you'll find that it's harder
than jump roping on the firm ground.]

1023
00:59:28,911 --> 00:59:31,390
[Takes the plunge into the water.]

1024
00:59:32,310 --> 00:59:34,096
- We have to get the rose!
- You do it.

1025
00:59:36,708 --> 00:59:39,597
[22 jumps still left to go.]

1026
00:59:39,598 --> 00:59:41,705
- Hurry!
- Why is there so much water on this mat?

1027
00:59:51,401 --> 00:59:52,824
It snapped!

1028
00:59:53,256 --> 00:59:55,249
That's what you deserve!

1029
00:59:56,512 --> 00:59:58,499
- The rope snapped!
- Fail!

1030
00:59:58,500 --> 01:00:00,063
[Kkuk power- fail.]

1031
01:00:00,064 --> 01:00:02,532
I haven't even had my turn yet!

1032
01:00:05,583 --> 01:00:08,525
[Team Seung Ri takes their turn
with a new jump rope in hand.]

1033
01:00:08,526 --> 01:00:10,827
You should do 28 jumps.

1034
01:00:11,647 --> 01:00:13,882
[Poor Seung Ri...]

1035
01:00:13,883 --> 01:00:14,943
Ready!

1036
01:00:20,732 --> 01:00:23,088
[He's good!]

1037
01:00:27,030 --> 01:00:29,522
[He's already done 15 all on his own!]

1038
01:00:32,303 --> 01:00:33,647
[Even Princess Blank is surprised.]

1039
01:00:33,648 --> 01:00:34,999
You've done 23!

1040
01:00:35,528 --> 01:00:38,755
[Current count, 23.]

1041
01:00:39,389 --> 01:00:42,033
[Passing it off to Haroro after 27 jumps.]

1042
01:00:42,870 --> 01:00:44,018
You have to do it too.

1043
01:00:44,669 --> 01:00:47,030
[Passes it off to Suk Jin after one jump.]

1044
01:00:47,254 --> 01:00:49,058
- You have to do two.
- I have to jump two.

1045
01:00:50,116 --> 01:00:52,284
[The rose can get on its way
as soon as Suk Jin does his two jumps.]

1046
01:00:52,285 --> 01:00:54,602
[But he has awful jump rope skills.]

1047
01:00:55,638 --> 01:00:57,112
[Are you guys ever going to come?]

1048
01:01:04,597 --> 01:01:07,072
[After all the frustration,
he finally completes the 30th jump.]

1049
01:01:07,831 --> 01:01:10,454
[On his way to Princess Blank!]

1050
01:01:12,208 --> 01:01:13,970
[Seung Ri running and parting the water.]

1051
01:01:14,358 --> 01:01:15,628
Hurry!

1052
01:01:18,453 --> 01:01:21,564
[Shoots the rose!]

1053
01:01:21,565 --> 01:01:23,450
[Too short.]

1054
01:01:25,972 --> 01:01:28,329
[Time's Up]

1055
01:01:32,566 --> 01:01:35,584
[Team GD's turn.]

1056
01:01:37,946 --> 01:01:39,788
[Laying down side by side?]

1057
01:01:40,900 --> 01:01:43,294
Why do you guys look so sexy?

1058
01:01:45,132 --> 01:01:47,040
[Throw it over here.]

1059
01:01:57,985 --> 01:02:00,213
[Wow... 18 jumps!]

1060
01:02:08,234 --> 01:02:11,301
[Experienced boxer,
Gary's blinding jump roping skills.]

1061
01:02:12,448 --> 01:02:14,772
[Gets the count up to 29 in a blink of an eye
and passes it off to GD.]

1062
01:02:15,391 --> 01:02:16,870
You just need to do one!

1063
01:02:18,294 --> 01:02:20,747
[Huh?
An acrobatic move?]

1064
01:02:24,459 --> 01:02:27,080
[Regardless, completes 30,
and on their way!]

1065
01:02:30,129 --> 01:02:31,640
[So close!]

1066
01:02:31,641 --> 01:02:33,630
[Could she have done that on purpose?]

1067
01:02:33,631 --> 01:02:34,959
Ji Hyo!

1068
01:02:37,062 --> 01:02:39,945
[Catch my rose!]

1069
01:02:41,089 --> 01:02:43,587
[One more chance at a success rides on GD!]

1070
01:02:46,089 --> 01:02:53,913
[Will the rose make it into the basket?]

1071
01:02:59,464 --> 01:03:01,315
Red Team succeeds!

1072
01:03:01,316 --> 01:03:03,435
[A perfect rose goal!]

1073
01:03:07,950 --> 01:03:11,378
[Suddenly, something is starting
to feel off.]

1074
01:03:13,323 --> 01:03:15,724
Isn't he supposed to get
back on his feet?

1075
01:03:17,813 --> 01:03:22,031
[GD's fall onto his back...
will that count against their success?

1076
01:03:22,032 --> 01:03:23,898
- He jumped over the rope.
- But he was lying down.

1077
01:03:23,899 --> 01:03:26,207
He didn't get back up on his feet.

1078
01:03:26,208 --> 01:03:28,618
In jump rope, you jump off your
feet and land on your feet.

1079
01:03:28,619 --> 01:03:30,711
But he landed on his butt
and stayed down.

1080
01:03:31,860 --> 01:03:33,569
- How did he jump rope with his butt?
- He sat down on his butt.

1081
01:03:33,570 --> 01:03:35,489
He totally sat down.
We all saw that.

1082
01:03:35,490 --> 01:03:37,363
G-Dragon fell down like this.

1083
01:03:37,364 --> 01:03:39,758
- How can you call that jump roping?
- He really did just sit down.

1084
01:03:39,759 --> 01:03:41,344
But he still jumped the rope.

1085
01:03:41,345 --> 01:03:44,920
<i>In that case, it's too ambiguous for
the staff to make the call on this one.</i>

1086
01:03:45,829 --> 01:03:50,366
<i>We will leave the decision up to
Princess Blank's judgment call.</i>

1087
01:03:55,529 --> 01:03:57,810
Okay.
Red Team's win is invalid!

1088
01:03:59,071 --> 01:04:00,841
[Do it again.]

1089
01:04:01,777 --> 01:04:04,391
[Their complaints succeeded!]

1090
01:04:14,765 --> 01:04:17,761
[Celebration breaks out.]

1091
01:04:21,448 --> 01:04:23,263
- Okay.
- In that case...

1092
01:04:23,264 --> 01:04:25,436
<i>Since the Princess ruled it invalid</i>

1093
01:04:25,437 --> 01:04:28,311
<i>the Red Team will get the chance to
make their second attempt first.</i>

1094
01:04:28,312 --> 01:04:29,702
[Team GD gets the first chance at the second
attempt from having their win overruled.]

1095
01:04:29,703 --> 01:04:31,917
- You can do that for them, right?
- Sure, let them go.

1096
01:04:31,918 --> 01:04:35,007
We normally wouldn't do it,
but we'll do it because of G-Dragon.

1097
01:04:36,022 --> 01:04:37,176
Ready.

1098
01:04:38,104 --> 01:04:40,048
[Boxer Gary to start it off again.]

1099
01:04:45,665 --> 01:04:47,001
You're doing great.

1100
01:04:48,336 --> 01:04:50,903
[Mr. Random Capable jump roping
at lightening speed.]

1101
01:04:55,619 --> 01:04:58,194
[Quickly completes 26 jumps.]

1102
01:05:01,418 --> 01:05:03,996
[Easily completes the three jumps.]

1103
01:05:03,997 --> 01:05:06,376
[Now it's all up to G-Dragon.]

1104
01:05:09,677 --> 01:05:10,973
[Succeeds in completing 30.]

1105
01:05:14,626 --> 01:05:16,373
[Are they going to dispute that too?]

1106
01:05:16,374 --> 01:05:17,870
That doesn't matter.

1107
01:05:20,219 --> 01:05:22,786
[Princess Blank...]

1108
01:05:22,787 --> 01:05:27,572
[Please accept my rose!]

1109
01:05:27,573 --> 01:05:29,744
[Ah...]

1110
01:05:30,486 --> 01:05:32,229
[Next up is, Gary!]

1111
01:05:32,230 --> 01:05:33,352
Catch it, Ji Hyo!

1112
01:05:33,353 --> 01:05:35,077
Catch it, Ji Hyo!

1113
01:05:46,374 --> 01:05:47,912
[Not even a chance, and fails.]

1114
01:05:47,913 --> 01:05:50,283
[GD rushes forward without
any hesitation.]

1115
01:05:58,182 --> 01:06:00,077
[The gap having been widened
the width of the Han River.]

1116
01:06:00,078 --> 01:06:02,878
- They pulled the mat back! It's too far!
- They can't pull the mat back!

1117
01:06:06,973 --> 01:06:09,506
[Their coordinated plan to
ruin the chances of Team GD's success.]

1118
01:06:11,537 --> 01:06:15,897
Did you know that the gap now is
over a hundred meters?

1119
01:06:16,301 --> 01:06:18,393
They can't pull the mat back like that.

1120
01:06:18,394 --> 01:06:21,677
Okay, then... from now on,
no more pulling of the mat!

1121
01:06:23,518 --> 01:06:27,424
[Breaking out into the unity song again.]

1122
01:06:30,551 --> 01:06:32,487
You're the most hateful one of the bunch!

1123
01:06:33,282 --> 01:06:35,125
Ready, set!

1124
01:06:36,906 --> 01:06:38,736
[Team Seung Ri's turn.]

1125
01:06:40,749 --> 01:06:43,621
[Seung Ri's jump roping skills are
impressive in its own right.]

1126
01:06:47,224 --> 01:06:49,614
[Already having completed 20 jumps
without even breaking.]

1127
01:06:51,291 --> 01:06:53,154
[27 jumps!]

1128
01:06:57,223 --> 01:06:59,433
[Haroro jumps two jumps,
and passes it off to Suk Jin.]

1129
01:06:59,434 --> 01:07:01,843
[They just need one more...
will Big-nosed Brother pull through?]

1130
01:07:01,844 --> 01:07:04,341
[Easily succeeds.]

1131
01:07:12,310 --> 01:07:14,438
[Giraffe, the king of interference.]

1132
01:07:17,812 --> 01:07:20,032
[A head on collision with the rolled up mat.]

1133
01:07:21,528 --> 01:07:23,560
[Giraffe using all sorts of methods
to interfere in other's game.]

1134
01:07:35,293 --> 01:07:36,514
[The rose doesn't even come close.]

1135
01:07:36,515 --> 01:07:38,647
[Second runner, Big-nosed Brother!]

1136
01:07:38,648 --> 01:07:41,144
[The mat is already twisted around
all thanks to the Giraffe's interference.]

1137
01:07:42,293 --> 01:07:43,659
What are you doing?

1138
01:07:44,860 --> 01:07:46,456
[Big-nosed Brother also fails.]

1139
01:07:47,282 --> 01:07:49,195
[Time over]

1140
01:07:49,806 --> 01:07:51,948
Hey, Lee Kwang Soo.
You just wait for your turn.

1141
01:07:54,023 --> 01:07:55,429
You did good, Kwang Soo.

1142
01:07:55,867 --> 01:07:58,139
It looked like a wave.

1143
01:07:58,504 --> 01:08:01,132
[A manmade mat wave.]

1144
01:08:01,814 --> 01:08:03,759
[Kwang-seidon calling forth the waves.]

1145
01:08:04,461 --> 01:08:06,345
- Do you all have your roses?
- Yes.

1146
01:08:07,054 --> 01:08:08,482
One, two, three...

1147
01:08:08,483 --> 01:08:11,056
[Gary, the jump roping machine.]

1148
01:08:12,466 --> 01:08:14,221
[Unbelievable speed.]

1149
01:08:16,097 --> 01:08:18,278
[He's jumping as if
he's jumping on solid ground.]

1150
01:08:22,214 --> 01:08:24,304
[Completes 28 jumps
without even breaking a sweat.]

1151
01:08:24,305 --> 01:08:26,112
[Wow, he's good.]

1152
01:08:26,566 --> 01:08:29,462
[They just need to complete
one jump each.]

1153
01:08:34,337 --> 01:08:36,054
[Falls down on his butt again.]

1154
01:08:47,433 --> 01:08:49,071
[Success]

1155
01:08:49,870 --> 01:08:51,104
[Yoo Hyuk on his way!]

1156
01:08:51,105 --> 01:08:52,712
[Huh?]

1157
01:08:56,578 --> 01:08:58,523
Seriously!
You guys are going too far!

1158
01:09:03,389 --> 01:09:05,080
[Haroro is behind Princess Blank?]

1159
01:09:05,191 --> 01:09:06,834
Come on.

1160
01:09:10,886 --> 01:09:12,537
[Where is Princess Blank going?]

1161
01:09:18,153 --> 01:09:19,885
[Not even close...]

1162
01:09:29,884 --> 01:09:31,341
- Ji Hyo!
- No!

1163
01:09:39,098 --> 01:09:41,066
[GD's rose is their last chance!]

1164
01:09:41,890 --> 01:09:43,582
- No!
- What are you doing!

1165
01:09:46,245 --> 01:09:48,032
[Fail]

1166
01:09:49,784 --> 01:09:51,600
That's too bad.
I thought that was going to make it in.

1167
01:09:53,765 --> 01:09:55,412
Let's do it!

1168
01:09:55,413 --> 01:09:57,494
No more interfering with each other
from now on!

1169
01:09:57,495 --> 01:09:59,658
- No more interfering!
- Let's play a fair game.

1170
01:09:59,659 --> 01:10:01,578
[A call for a truce to stop interrupting
that's always in words only.]

1171
01:10:03,456 --> 01:10:05,025
You just be quiet.
We'll take care of ourselves.

1172
01:10:05,026 --> 01:10:06,429
[You just wait and see!]

1173
01:10:07,517 --> 01:10:08,628
Okay.

1174
01:10:08,663 --> 01:10:10,676
[Team Dae Sung's turn.]

1175
01:10:15,598 --> 01:10:18,981
[Muscle Boy kicking up a lot of water.]

1176
01:10:20,842 --> 01:10:23,057
[Trips over the rope at 18.]

1177
01:10:23,058 --> 01:10:24,663
Pass it on if you're caught on the line!

1178
01:10:25,794 --> 01:10:28,042
[Can't hear you.]

1179
01:10:29,523 --> 01:10:31,770
[Completes 28 jumps by ignoring
the Giraffe.]

1180
01:10:31,771 --> 01:10:33,379
[They just need one jump each
for them to succeed this step.]

1181
01:10:37,822 --> 01:10:40,133
[There's never anything easy with him...]

1182
01:10:40,134 --> 01:10:42,155
[Succeeds in jumping 30.]

1183
01:10:43,439 --> 01:10:45,100
[Dae Sung makes his way.]

1184
01:10:45,101 --> 01:10:48,394
[An aggressive interfering tactic.]

1185
01:10:55,370 --> 01:10:57,546
[Next runner, Kkuk.]

1186
01:11:04,138 --> 01:11:05,566
[The Tiger's jump.]

1187
01:11:05,567 --> 01:11:07,337
- What the heck?
- What was that?

1188
01:11:08,818 --> 01:11:13,034
[Now he just has to shoot!]

1189
01:11:17,820 --> 01:11:20,896
[The final runner, Giraffe.]

1190
01:11:20,897 --> 01:11:22,246
[Time over]

1191
01:11:24,008 --> 01:11:26,964
- Let's play it fairly from now on.
- Seriously, no more interference from now on.

1192
01:11:27,506 --> 01:11:29,528
[The never-ending battle of interference.]

1193
01:11:30,452 --> 01:11:33,357
<i>Since you guys started it,
you guys figure out how to end it.</i>

1194
01:11:33,358 --> 01:11:35,220
Okay!
Leave it to us!

1195
01:11:35,221 --> 01:11:38,517
- We can stop this ourselves.
- Let me borrow a pair of scissors!

1196
01:11:39,270 --> 01:11:40,416
Okay.

1197
01:11:40,417 --> 01:11:43,158
Let's just do this for the next eight weeks
for the sake of entertainment.

1198
01:11:44,420 --> 01:11:46,875
[They're planning on seeing how far
they can take the battle of interference?]

1199
01:11:48,063 --> 01:11:51,013
Make sure that you throw it far
so that Ji Hyo can catch it.

1200
01:11:51,014 --> 01:11:52,798
- Please catch it!
- Fighting!

1201
01:11:54,029 --> 01:11:56,566
<i>I want to give myself to you!</i>

1202
01:11:58,074 --> 01:11:59,568
What's wrong with his voice?

1203
01:12:00,089 --> 01:12:01,315
Ready.

1204
01:12:01,350 --> 01:12:02,793
[Team Seung Ri- Start.]

1205
01:12:04,347 --> 01:12:06,563
[Explosive jump rope skills.]

1206
01:12:14,723 --> 01:12:16,479
[Completes 27 jumps and then
passes it on.]

1207
01:12:18,660 --> 01:12:22,066
[Ro-Ro to complete the final jump.]

1208
01:12:22,067 --> 01:12:23,930
[30 complete!]

1209
01:12:25,517 --> 01:12:28,347
[Princess Ji Hyo!]

1210
01:12:37,182 --> 01:12:39,928
[Wow! The rose makes the goal!]

1211
01:12:39,929 --> 01:12:42,003
[Big-nosed Brother does it!]

1212
01:12:43,363 --> 01:12:45,366
[Haroro makes his dash for it!]

1213
01:12:46,590 --> 01:12:47,908
[Catch it!]

1214
01:12:54,730 --> 01:12:56,879
[What's going on here?
Haroro too? Two goals in a row!]

1215
01:12:57,594 --> 01:12:59,585
[Will Seung Ri make it too?]

1216
01:13:03,621 --> 01:13:06,257
[Bravo!
All three of them succeed!]

1217
01:13:11,310 --> 01:13:13,218
[Unbelievable!]

1218
01:13:13,219 --> 01:13:17,606
<i>Blue Team come forward and
receive the top card.</i>

1219
01:13:17,607 --> 01:13:18,886
[Team Seung Ri receives the top card
from having come in at first place.]

1220
01:13:20,414 --> 01:13:22,045
Thank you, Princess.

1221
01:13:23,818 --> 01:13:26,035
[Team GD receives the middle card
for having come in at second place.]

1222
01:13:29,501 --> 01:13:32,100
[Team Dae Sung receives the final bottom card
for having come in at last place.]

1223
01:13:34,294 --> 01:13:35,962
[Oops...]

1224
01:13:39,438 --> 01:13:41,776
[They're happy?]

1225
01:13:45,095 --> 01:13:46,762
Let's just go.

1226
01:13:53,952 --> 01:13:55,889
[The final mission.]

1227
01:14:00,379 --> 01:14:03,924
[Just what is the final battle
that awaits them here?]

1228
01:14:05,367 --> 01:14:07,958
[Yi-cheon Art Hall.]

1229
01:14:20,034 --> 01:14:21,506
Look at the red carpet.

1230
01:14:23,522 --> 01:14:24,692
What is this?

1231
01:14:26,408 --> 01:14:28,546
I feel like something really
substantial is going to happen here.

1232
01:14:30,607 --> 01:14:33,267
[Princess Ji Hyo is asked to wait outside.]

1233
01:14:33,268 --> 01:14:36,119
- We'll see you soon.
- I'll see you later.

1234
01:14:37,617 --> 01:14:40,273
[Team GD also makes their entrance.]

1235
01:14:44,801 --> 01:14:46,437
There's a door over there.

1236
01:14:48,456 --> 01:14:50,096
What is this?

1237
01:14:50,097 --> 01:14:52,572
[All three teams gathering at the location
of their final mission.]

1238
01:14:54,633 --> 01:14:56,306
[The final competition...]

1239
01:14:56,307 --> 01:14:59,556
[Just who will the victory go to?]

1240
01:15:04,051 --> 01:15:05,657
[Princess Ji Hyo is seated upon her throne.]

1241
01:15:05,658 --> 01:15:07,006
Please have a seat.

1242
01:15:07,007 --> 01:15:08,604
[And she's handed four cards?]

1243
01:15:09,126 --> 01:15:10,446
<i>This is your final mission.</i>

1244
01:15:10,447 --> 01:15:15,182
<i>Each of the teams has received
three cards thus far.</i>

1245
01:15:16,407 --> 01:15:25,064
<i>Princess Ji Hyo currently holds four cards
numbered from ten through thirteen.</i>

1246
01:15:25,958 --> 01:15:31,886
<i>You will each trade in one of your cards for
a card that she holds in her hand.</i>

1247
01:15:31,887 --> 01:15:35,633
[Trade in one of their cards for a high
numbered card Ji Hyo holds in her hand.]

1248
01:15:35,634 --> 01:15:39,925
<i>You have trade in your card one at a time
to a total of three times.</i>

1249
01:15:40,440 --> 01:15:45,746
<i>Then the team with the final count of
the highest number will be the final winner.</i>

1250
01:15:46,982 --> 01:15:48,179
So this is all about luck.

1251
01:15:48,644 --> 01:15:50,378
So highest number wins?

1252
01:15:56,683 --> 01:15:59,225
<i>If even after all the cards
have been exchanged...</i>

1253
01:15:59,507 --> 01:16:02,504
<i>the total count of the cards
that Princess Ji Hyo holds...</i>

1254
01:16:02,505 --> 01:16:04,564
<i>is higher in count that the cards
that you all hold in your hand...</i>

1255
01:16:04,565 --> 01:16:08,121
<i>then Princess Ji Hyo will be
the sole winner of all the gold.</i>

1256
01:16:08,122 --> 01:16:09,831
No!

1257
01:16:10,289 --> 01:16:11,528
Stop it with that.

1258
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:16,605
- Are you all ready?
- Yes.

1259
01:16:16,606 --> 01:16:18,547
[Round one- Start.]

1260
01:16:18,548 --> 01:16:21,101
- The team that won the last round?
- That's us.

1261
01:16:22,128 --> 01:16:25,452
<i>Then your team will start
the exchange process.</i>

1262
01:16:25,453 --> 01:16:27,459
We have to be careful with
what we choose.

1263
01:16:30,086 --> 01:16:31,712
I think this will be the best choice.

1264
01:16:37,801 --> 01:16:40,602
[Must choose the higher card from
Princess Ji Hyo's deck for a chance to win.]

1265
01:16:43,989 --> 01:16:47,521
[Cards that the Princess holds in
her hands are... 10, 11, 12, 13.]

1266
01:16:49,052 --> 01:16:52,517
I hope you pick a good one.
I mixed them all up, so I don't know.

1267
01:16:53,323 --> 01:17:05,164
[Which card will Seung Ri choose?]

1268
01:17:06,226 --> 01:17:07,479
Is it okay if we look?

1269
01:17:08,072 --> 01:17:09,308
We can look, right?

1270
01:17:15,352 --> 01:17:17,735
[Their card selection is 11.]

1271
01:17:18,141 --> 01:17:20,563
Do we have to mix up all
four cards now?

1272
01:17:20,904 --> 01:17:21,872
<i>No, you mix up only the three cards.</i>

1273
01:17:21,873 --> 01:17:25,995
[Take out the card they just picked,
and mix up their three original cards.]

1274
01:17:25,996 --> 01:17:28,027
Picking last would be the least
advantageous.

1275
01:17:29,037 --> 01:17:31,642
[Of these cards...]

1276
01:17:31,643 --> 01:17:42,070
[The Princess needs to pick the lowest number
for them to have a chance at winning.]

1277
01:17:44,259 --> 01:17:47,862
[Just which one of the three
did she choose?]

1278
01:17:52,722 --> 01:17:55,382
[She chooses number seven,
the highest number from their deck!]

1279
01:17:58,051 --> 01:17:59,492
It's our turn now.

1280
01:18:00,468 --> 01:18:01,953
This is pretty thrilling.

1281
01:18:03,246 --> 01:18:05,674
[Time to exchange with Team GD.]

1282
01:18:05,675 --> 01:18:08,817
<i>She will now mix up all four
of her cards.</i>

1283
01:18:08,818 --> 01:18:11,848
[She can now mix up all four cards including
the one she just picked.]

1284
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:14,783
We really needed to win the last game.

1285
01:18:14,784 --> 01:18:17,518
[The later the team gets to pick,
the more disadvantageous it is for them.]

1286
01:18:18,344 --> 01:18:19,999
Let's pick a good one.

1287
01:18:21,382 --> 01:18:27,863
[GD to choose the card.]

1288
01:18:27,864 --> 01:18:33,261
[Is he trying to see through the cards?]

1289
01:18:33,262 --> 01:18:35,028
No, I don't think that was the right card.

1290
01:18:36,297 --> 01:18:37,975
No, I don't think that was the right card.

1291
01:18:37,976 --> 01:18:39,603
[Completes his card selection.]

1292
01:18:39,604 --> 01:18:41,149
I can guess from her expression.

1293
01:18:42,756 --> 01:18:44,780
- What if you took our original card?
- You did fine.

1294
01:18:51,362 --> 01:18:55,118
[Wow! He chooses the high card,
number 12!]

1295
01:18:55,119 --> 01:18:56,780
[Trying to control his facial expression.]

1296
01:18:56,781 --> 01:18:58,619
We're curious to see if it's our card.

1297
01:18:59,148 --> 01:19:02,223
Their original cards weren't bad, right?

1298
01:19:02,224 --> 01:19:09,034
[It's now Princess Ji Hyo's turn to pick.]

1299
01:19:09,848 --> 01:19:12,679
[Please let it be the four.]

1300
01:19:23,574 --> 01:19:26,013
[It is now Team Dae Sung's turn.]

1301
01:19:28,042 --> 01:19:29,814
Why do I feel so nervous?

1302
01:19:29,815 --> 01:19:32,434
Just pick one.
My lucky right hand!

1303
01:19:32,435 --> 01:19:34,762
- My right hand!
- Your lucky right hand?

1304
01:19:35,954 --> 01:19:41,300
[Which card did Dae Sung's
lucky right hand pick?]

1305
01:19:41,301 --> 01:19:43,914
- There's just one card here.
- Don't show anyone.

1306
01:19:45,063 --> 01:19:47,326
- There can be only one choice.
- Show the camera your card.

1307
01:19:49,918 --> 01:19:52,539
[Huh?
What's wrong?]

1308
01:19:54,843 --> 01:19:58,138
[His reaction is a bit...
Is he laughing over a low number?]

1309
01:19:58,139 --> 01:19:59,868
Why do you think that I'm
laughing right now?

1310
01:19:59,869 --> 01:20:02,403
It can only be one card,
so what's the number?

1311
01:20:03,077 --> 01:20:10,039
[Of all the cards in Ji Hyo's hand...
he has to pick 6 of all numbers?]

1312
01:20:10,040 --> 01:20:13,404
Maybe your hand is a bit... cursed?

1313
01:20:15,036 --> 01:20:18,487
[Thus, Jong Kook takes the cards from
Dae Sung's hand to mix it up himself.]

1314
01:20:18,488 --> 01:20:19,858
Pick the highest number.

1315
01:20:19,859 --> 01:20:21,604
- That's the right one.
- Wow.

1316
01:20:30,691 --> 01:20:32,881
- She picked the high card, didn't she?
- I heard Dae Sung say they're in trouble.

1317
01:20:33,488 --> 01:20:36,293
- I feel bad she picked such a low card.
- You can quit the act now.

1318
01:20:36,294 --> 01:20:38,003
You can stop it now.
We've already figured you out.

1319
01:20:38,452 --> 01:20:40,474
- Round one is now over.
- Yes.

1320
01:20:53,877 --> 01:20:55,406
- Fighting!
- Fighting!

1321
01:20:55,407 --> 01:20:58,506
[It's getting more and more crucial
to choose the right card.]

1322
01:21:05,755 --> 01:21:07,778
[Is it an act?
Or is the laughter for real?]

1323
01:21:08,302 --> 01:21:10,674
[Wow! He chose a high card!]

1324
01:21:15,715 --> 01:21:19,793
[Will she take their low card?]

1325
01:21:25,086 --> 01:21:26,496
That's what I thought.

1326
01:21:26,497 --> 01:21:28,235
[Team Seung Ri feeling flustered?]

1327
01:21:28,587 --> 01:21:30,551
Did they lose the card that
they picked earlier?

1328
01:21:31,867 --> 01:21:34,408
[But the truth is,
it was one of their low cards!]

1329
01:21:35,847 --> 01:21:38,529
[Their count went to 23 from 16.]

1330
01:21:39,723 --> 01:21:42,025
[Team GD's second exchange opportunity.]

1331
01:21:47,578 --> 01:21:49,804
[Why are you grabbing her wrist?]

1332
01:21:49,805 --> 01:21:51,431
Why are you grabbing her hand?

1333
01:22:01,091 --> 01:22:03,353
[He picks her highest card!]

1334
01:22:03,354 --> 01:22:06,373
Look at the way he's acting.
He picked a good card.

1335
01:22:06,374 --> 01:22:08,909
[His expression that he cannot
keep hidden.]

1336
01:22:18,639 --> 01:22:20,926
[It would be amazing for them if Ji Hyo
just picked their number four card.]

1337
01:22:31,870 --> 01:22:33,698
What do I do?

1338
01:22:33,699 --> 01:22:36,165
<i>You may now exchange your card
with Kwang Soo.</i>

1339
01:22:37,313 --> 01:22:39,884
[Princess Ji Hyo starting to feel danger.]

1340
01:22:44,255 --> 01:22:45,280
[Kwang Soo from Team Dae Sung's turn.]

1341
01:22:45,281 --> 01:22:47,381
He's famous for his failures.

1342
01:22:48,760 --> 01:22:53,630
[This could put Princess Ji Hyo
in extreme danger.]

1343
01:22:53,631 --> 01:22:55,325
- Please trust me on this one.
- You should pick from the left.

1344
01:22:57,031 --> 01:22:58,863
- Two or a six.
- It'll be one of those two.

1345
01:23:00,089 --> 01:23:02,416
[Huh... what is it?]

1346
01:23:06,251 --> 01:23:08,522
[Figures...]

1347
01:23:09,472 --> 01:23:12,105
[Bad luck Giraffe...
He picked the lowest number she had.]

1348
01:23:13,974 --> 01:23:17,591
- You can't give each other any signals.
- None of us here has any luck.

1349
01:23:20,772 --> 01:23:25,108
[At this rate, they can only hope that
Princess Ji Hyo takes their lowest card.]

1350
01:23:26,551 --> 01:23:27,968
Please let it be the low card.

1351
01:23:32,915 --> 01:23:35,233
[The card she picked... is one!]

1352
01:23:37,133 --> 01:23:39,237
[Could there still be hope for them?]

1353
01:23:41,750 --> 01:23:43,741
Okay, round two is now over.

1354
01:23:45,799 --> 01:23:46,983
[Team Seung Ri- 1, 10, 11.
A total of 23.]

1355
01:23:46,984 --> 01:23:50,764
[Team GD- 4, 12, 13. A total of 29.
Team Dae Sung- 3, 5, 6. A total of 14.]

1356
01:24:00,344 --> 01:24:02,566
This is the final round.

1357
01:24:03,101 --> 01:24:05,614
[The winner will be determined after
this final round of exchange!

1358
01:24:07,057 --> 01:24:08,268
We've got nothing.

1359
01:24:08,269 --> 01:24:09,863
Do you have a lot of low numbers?

1360
01:24:09,864 --> 01:24:11,788
I don't know either.
I haven't really checked.

1361
01:24:12,106 --> 01:24:15,254
[Team Seung Ri still has a
chance at a win.]

1362
01:24:15,255 --> 01:24:20,818
[Will he pick her high card?]

1363
01:24:26,285 --> 01:24:27,399
Please.

1364
01:24:29,497 --> 01:24:30,673
Look at his expression.

1365
01:24:31,367 --> 01:24:34,428
[The other teams bursts out in laughter.]

1366
01:24:34,429 --> 01:24:36,158
We're all set!

1367
01:24:37,823 --> 01:24:39,575
[Just what is the number
that he chose?]

1368
01:24:39,576 --> 01:24:43,026
[Their selection will determine their fate.]

1369
01:24:43,027 --> 01:24:46,036
- This is really nerve-wrecking though.
- I'm getting nervous too.

1370
01:24:47,862 --> 01:24:50,631
[There's only one card that they
want the Princess to take.]

1371
01:24:51,592 --> 01:24:54,899
[Just which one of these cards
did she take?]

1372
01:24:58,092 --> 01:24:59,765
I don't know, but I'm just going to pick!

1373
01:24:59,766 --> 01:25:01,020
[Jae Suk from Team GD's turn.]

1374
01:25:07,466 --> 01:25:10,169
[A anxiety ridden moment.]

1375
01:25:10,170 --> 01:25:11,971
I don't know what's what either.

1376
01:25:17,283 --> 01:25:20,523
To you...
I hope that this got to you.

1377
01:25:23,442 --> 01:25:25,342
[Huh? What is
that expression on his face?]

1378
01:25:25,343 --> 01:25:26,993
[Are they trying to control
their facial expression again?]

1379
01:25:26,994 --> 01:25:29,579
[Or did he really pick a lower card?]

1380
01:25:29,580 --> 01:25:32,395
[Just what is the card
that he picked?]

1381
01:25:35,955 --> 01:25:38,542
[A good sign for Team GD who's been
in first standing until round two?]

1382
01:25:38,954 --> 01:25:43,545
[But they still have two high cards left...]

1383
01:25:48,533 --> 01:25:49,978
[His expression is...]

1384
01:25:49,979 --> 01:25:52,684
- She just took their high card.
- I knew it!

1385
01:25:52,685 --> 01:25:55,487
[Did Princess Ji Hyo really take
their high card?]

1386
01:25:55,488 --> 01:25:56,811
Princess!

1387
01:25:59,698 --> 01:26:01,038
Let's do this!

1388
01:26:02,492 --> 01:26:05,324
[Kkuk's final selection.]

1389
01:26:08,353 --> 01:26:11,211
[Is he calling on his psychic powers?]

1390
01:26:13,481 --> 01:26:16,339
[It's coming.. the feeling is coming.]

1391
01:26:18,446 --> 01:26:20,226
You got it, Jong Kook.

1392
01:26:20,753 --> 01:26:23,448
[Checking his card.]

1393
01:26:23,449 --> 01:26:24,645
Please show the camera your card.

1394
01:26:24,646 --> 01:26:26,262
It's nothing, is it?

1395
01:26:26,263 --> 01:26:28,058
I don't think he got anything.

1396
01:26:29,787 --> 01:26:34,058
[The work of God?
The number one is back in their hands.]

1397
01:26:34,059 --> 01:26:37,263
We got it.
Jong Kook did it.

1398
01:26:38,425 --> 01:26:40,148
Jong Kook is Jong Kook!

1399
01:26:41,422 --> 01:26:46,170
It's Song Ji Hyo's turn to make
her very last selection.

1400
01:26:47,197 --> 01:26:51,358
[Team Dae Sung only has
all the low cards.]

1401
01:26:52,919 --> 01:26:54,668
Ji Hyo's going to pick their high card.

1402
01:26:59,723 --> 01:27:01,839
I bet they lost an important card.

1403
01:27:02,401 --> 01:27:04,537
<i>Okay, all three rounds are now over.</i>

1404
01:27:04,538 --> 01:27:07,551
<i>As you can all see,
Song Ji Hyo has four cards.</i>

1405
01:27:07,552 --> 01:27:10,417
- So it gives her an advantage.
- Yes, it does.

1406
01:27:10,811 --> 01:27:16,626
<i>Thus, the three team must discuss and
agree on which card she must discard.</i>

1407
01:27:16,627 --> 01:27:18,396
Yes, that's more fair.

1408
01:27:18,397 --> 01:27:20,580
[The three teams must agree on which
card she must discard.]

1409
01:27:20,581 --> 01:27:24,218
[One of the men has to pick one of her
cards that she must discard.]

1410
01:27:24,219 --> 01:27:27,431
[Gary chosen to choose one of her cards?]

1411
01:27:27,432 --> 01:27:28,955
<i>Gary must go in front of Ji Hyo...</i>

1412
01:27:29,469 --> 01:27:32,524
<i>and choose which one of her cards
she must discard.</i>

1413
01:27:34,321 --> 01:27:38,710
[This selection can determine
who the victor will be.]

1414
01:27:39,173 --> 01:27:41,617
[Princess Ji Hyo mixed up her cards
without looking herself.]

1415
01:27:42,495 --> 01:27:48,431
[Just... which card will she
have to discard?]

1416
01:27:48,432 --> 01:27:51,813
[Gary chooses one of her cards.]

1417
01:27:53,452 --> 01:27:56,330
So Gary's selection will
determine Ji Hyo's fate.

1418
01:27:56,331 --> 01:27:58,170
It's all on Gary.

1419
01:27:58,171 --> 01:28:00,394
I did what I thought
would be best for the princess.

1420
01:28:00,395 --> 01:28:05,035
<i>All three teams and Princess Ji Hyo
now have three cards each.</i>

1421
01:28:05,036 --> 01:28:06,496
- Yes.
- In that case...

1422
01:28:06,497 --> 01:28:10,238
<i>We will now start with Team Seung Ri,
who was first to make their exchange.</i>

1423
01:28:10,239 --> 01:28:12,314
<i>Please reveal your cards one at a time.</i>

1424
01:28:12,315 --> 01:28:13,497
<i>Please reveal your cards.</i>

1425
01:28:17,442 --> 01:28:19,870
[Not a bad number.]

1426
01:28:23,721 --> 01:28:27,246
[Already at 17?
Team Seung Ri has a rather high count!]

1427
01:28:27,247 --> 01:28:28,522
Ha Ha.

1428
01:28:31,807 --> 01:28:32,825
<i>Reveal your card.</i>

1429
01:28:32,826 --> 01:28:34,193
<i>Reveal your card.</i>

1430
01:28:38,755 --> 01:28:40,407
You had me scared there for a moment.

1431
01:28:41,335 --> 01:28:43,284
This is the level we are.

1432
01:28:43,285 --> 01:28:46,437
Team Seung Ri has a total of 19.

1433
01:28:48,676 --> 01:28:50,864
[Team GD starts off with four.]

1434
01:28:50,865 --> 01:28:52,742
I hope that you continue like that.

1435
01:28:56,526 --> 01:28:57,738
There it is!

1436
01:29:00,324 --> 01:29:02,267
- I'm sorry.
- There it is!

1437
01:29:03,424 --> 01:29:07,048
[The highest card in the game!]

1438
01:29:07,501 --> 01:29:11,764
[Team GD, a total of 25.]

1439
01:29:11,765 --> 01:29:13,609
<i>Lee Kwang Soo, please show your card.</i>

1440
01:29:14,572 --> 01:29:16,014
That card came from us.

1441
01:29:16,427 --> 01:29:18,051
That was our card.

1442
01:29:19,948 --> 01:29:23,213
[Even their next card is meager.]

1443
01:29:23,214 --> 01:29:24,555
They have no chance of winning.

1444
01:29:24,556 --> 01:29:26,276
<i>And finally, Kim Jong Kook.</i>

1445
01:29:29,749 --> 01:29:32,281
[Oh my...]

1446
01:29:32,282 --> 01:29:33,891
What the heck!

1447
01:29:33,892 --> 01:29:35,354
They have no chance whatsoever.

1448
01:29:35,355 --> 01:29:38,348
[All three cards don't even
add up to 10...]

1449
01:29:38,734 --> 01:29:42,782
- You picked this, and made its way back.
- Seriously?

1450
01:29:43,214 --> 01:29:45,367
Song Ji Hyo, please show your card
one at a time.

1451
01:29:45,368 --> 01:29:47,447
[Time for Princess Ji Hyo to show her cards.]

1452
01:29:47,448 --> 01:29:49,791
- Wow... it's 12.
- What is it?

1453
01:29:49,792 --> 01:29:51,592
- 12?
- Yeah, she just showed 12.

1454
01:29:51,593 --> 01:29:53,190
- That's the first card you show?
- She already has us beat.

1455
01:29:53,191 --> 01:29:55,619
- I really had no idea what I had.
- She beat us with just one card.

1456
01:29:55,620 --> 01:29:57,555
This really is a stab to our pride.

1457
01:29:57,556 --> 01:30:00,018
Please reveal  your second card.

1458
01:30:01,716 --> 01:30:04,065
[Next card is, nine!]

1459
01:30:04,761 --> 01:30:08,083
[That was originally
Team Dae Sung's card.]

1460
01:30:08,839 --> 01:30:12,447
- Song Ji Hyo, please show your last card.
- Let's see what her final card is.

1461
01:30:12,823 --> 01:30:16,463
[What is her final card?]

1462
01:30:16,464 --> 01:30:20,154
[If the card is lower than four,
then Team GD wins!]

1463
01:30:20,155 --> 01:30:23,791
[But if the card is higher than four,
then Princess Ji Hyo wins!]

1464
01:30:26,258 --> 01:30:27,848
Wow!

1465
01:30:29,392 --> 01:30:32,001
[Her final card is 11!]

1466
01:30:32,002 --> 01:30:33,961
- She doesn't have a single low card.
- Which card did she discard?

1467
01:30:33,962 --> 01:30:37,274
[The card that Gary discarded was...]

1468
01:30:37,275 --> 01:30:39,463
Even her lowest number would've
made her win.

1469
01:30:39,464 --> 01:30:41,491
[Number six was her lowest card.]

1470
01:30:43,247 --> 01:30:46,846
[An astounding total of 38.]

1471
01:30:46,847 --> 01:30:50,343
[Princess Ji Hyo wins!]

1472
01:30:57,482 --> 01:31:01,414
[Jaw dropping prize.]

1473
01:31:03,210 --> 01:31:05,602
There it is!
Song Ji Hyo!

1474
01:31:05,603 --> 01:31:09,582
[Ji Hyo takes the gold yet again!]

1475
01:31:10,558 --> 01:31:12,569
There's something with you and gold.
