00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:41,200
[Defeat the pressure...]

172
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:48,410
[Start]

173
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,820
[Won't move even an inch...]

174
00:09:56,850 --> 00:09:58,260
<i>You really can't get it?</i>

175
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:01,990
[Hold on...]

176
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:08,770
[An amazing reaction.]

177
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:11,060
What is this? Why is it like this?

178
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:14,030
- It's the pressure!
- Is it really that bad?

179
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:17,720
[The giraffe is exerting every
bit of energy from all the plants he ate.]

180
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:20,900
What's wrong with this?

181
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:24,900
<i>- Don't joke around... stop it.
- That's enough.</i>

182
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:28,140
<i>Stop messing around!</i>

183
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,910
<i>Take this seriously now.</i>

184
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,630
[Only the handle is moving...]

185
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:38,630
<i>What is he supposed to do?</i>

186
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:41,060
<i>Is he being serious?</i>

187
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:42,760
This hurts so much. Look!

188
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:45,140
<i>It has been one minute!</i>

189
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:46,910
He can't receive the inheritance!

190
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:49,770
He's not worthy.

191
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:50,990
[Taking out his frustrations on the plungers]

192
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:52,480
What are you doing right now?

193
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,400
How did anyone think to put
these on here?

194
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,660
- Seriously!
- You really can't take them off?

195
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,410
<i>That's two! Two!</i>

196
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,060
<i>It doesn't work even when
you're holding it there?</i>

197
00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:13,120
[Three removed!]

198
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:18,420
All the pressure... since I was young!

199
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:23,250
[Was trying to help pick
up the one that dropped but...]

200
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:25,070
Oh wow...

201
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:31,980
Wow, this is no joke.

202
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:33,760
- It's really that hard?
- It's really hard.

203
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,970
- How are we supposed to get these off?
- Where are these from? Let me get one.

204
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:39,820
[The last one... success!]

205
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,470
[Giraffe's record= 2 minutes 54 seconds]

206
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:53,970
[The long but brief time
to overcome the pressure.]

207
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,710
<i>The time is no different
than forfeiting.</i>

208
00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:00,190
I'm pretty sure it's not.

209
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:03,770
And from our team, Woo Bin will go.

210
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:07,730
- Good luck, Woo Bin!
- Let's go, Woo Bin!

211
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:10,260
Let's see how different he is!

212
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:12,440
Make it a clean and quick win.
Clean and quick.

213
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:15,230
Let's see whether or not
Woo Bin will become a squid.

214
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,830
[Start]

215
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,770
[Bitter laughter...]

216
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:32,280
Woo Bin the time is still going.

217
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:34,880
Really?

218
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:38,010
Woo Bin you must be tired already!
It's tough, isn't it?

219
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:39,870
- Woo Bin it's time for you to start.
- Let's go Woo Bin.

220
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,290
[Finally the first one!]

221
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:46,230
You know how to do it now!

222
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:50,480
[Mastered the technique?
Two in a row.]

223
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,970
[Dang...]

224
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:59,460
[He knows how to do it now.
Three in a row!]

225
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:07,800
He's not even grunting anymore!

226
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,330
[Success]

227
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:14,590
[Masculine?]

228
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:16,210
What the heck?

229
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:18,360
<i>39.37 seconds!</i>

230
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,960
- I'd like to try one more time!
- Yeah right!

231
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:25,060
<i>So the Blue Team wins
the first round.</i>

232
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:30,530
<i>From now on, the opposing team
will put the plungers on.</i>

233
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:33,120
What did you do? What did you do?

234
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,940
It was really hard for me.

235
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,440
[Jumping?]

236
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,790
You're going to put it all the way
up there?

237
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:42,530
Jin Hyuk, you don't look like
the type. What are you doing?

238
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:46,090
[His unknown competitive side
is surfacing.]

239
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:47,970
He's pretty competitive.

240
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,340
[What are you doing?]

241
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:54,110
[Looking around]

242
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:56,940
What are you two trying to do?

243
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:58,850
Neither of them wants to carry
the other person.

244
00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:00,850
[In the end Woo Bin is on the bottom...]

245
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:07,690
Woo Bin! Why are you so weak?

246
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:09,840
Are you telling me I lost to him?

247
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:14,340
Get up both of you!

248
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:16,510
What's wrong with you guys?

249
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:19,990
Jin Hyuk, you're more fit.
Why do you keep trying to go on top?

250
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:22,820
You can carry Woo Bin instead!

251
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,240
Why are you getting involved
with our team again?

252
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,030
I'm just saying! Look!

253
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:28,150
He... he's younger than me.

254
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:31,370
[Even good-looking gentlemen
have respect for elders.]

255
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:35,700
[This time Woo Bin is on top.]

256
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:38,060
He's not that good at being
on top either...

257
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,300
[Just barely...]

258
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:43,400
You're not as perfect as you seem.

259
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:45,940
[The imperfect heir, Kim Woo Bin.]

260
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:49,390
I don't think it'll go up that far!

261
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:51,660
That's not that high!

262
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,090
- He's a bit ditzy...
- What are you doing?

263
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:04,830
It just fell off!

264
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:07,390
- Will it be better to jump and stick it on?
- Yeah, that will be better.

265
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:09,340
Give it to me, I'll do it.

266
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:12,070
[Now what are you doing...]

267
00:15:13,090 --> 00:15:16,520
What are you two doing now? You
guys keep attempting to do things but...

268
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:19,320
We thought this would be quick
but it's taking a really long time!

269
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:23,330
What are you planning?

270
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:25,860
You're really falling apart on us today.

271
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:28,130
It's funnier when
good-looking people do this.

272
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:29,520
[Finally]

273
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:39,190
[Up he goes...]

274
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,760
What are you doing Jin Hyuk?

275
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:57,910
[These two do not let us down.]

276
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:02,790
It's like watching a circus act.

277
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:07,280
[Gary, showing an example
of what to do.]

278
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:10,420
Look at him!
That's what you should be doing!

279
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:12,090
Be careful.

280
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:19,420
[A selfless stunt simulation.]

281
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:23,210
[Not very high up.]

282
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:27,170
<i>Two men, please step up for
the second round.</i>

283
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:29,080
<i>You have to hold on to the waist.</i>

284
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,380
The waist?

285
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:32,090
Let's do it together.

286
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:33,890
You two will be a good combination.

287
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:36,530
<i>This is a timed competition.
Are you two sure?</i>

288
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:38,530
- Why?
- What are you trying to say?

289
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,640
[Who wouldn't be worried?]

290
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:44,840
I'm so humiliated I will
definitely take those plungers off!

291
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:47,600
Show them how it's done!

292
00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:51,730
[Slip]

293
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,560
What are you guys doing?

294
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:55,870
I think this thing is crazy.

295
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:07,800
[They can do this all night]

296
00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:10,900
[There's something black
on his face...]

297
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:13,580
Why is Suk Jin's face so dark?

298
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:20,260
Suk Jin, the black powder from
your head is all over your face.

299
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:22,710
- Really?
- It's all over you. Right here, right here.

300
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,200
[The secret to his dark hair
has been revealed.]

301
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:30,440
[Remnants of black powder everywhere.]

302
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:35,020
We are definitely from a wealthy family!

303
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:38,020
There is coal coming out of
my brother's head!

304
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:40,600
Why'd you take my hat off?

305
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,180
His stylist sprayed a lot on today.

306
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:48,490
[Focusing on the game to
distract everyone.]

307
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,380
[Switching places and trying again]

308
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:55,100
I saw her spraying more
than usual today.

309
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:58,690
- You got it! Do it again! Again!
- You grab it again this time.

310
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,030
One, two--

311
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:04,180
One, two--

312
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:06,710
One, two--

313
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:12,430
Last one! Last one!

314
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:14,540
One, two!

315
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:16,630
[Success...]

316
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:21,350
The squid ink brothers!

317
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:23,520
I saw this morning and your
stylist sprayed on way too much.

318
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,290
Ji Suk Coal.

319
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:31,550
[Coal mine heir, Ji Suk Jin.]

320
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:34,170
<i>That was 1 minute 33 seconds.</i>

321
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:36,220
<i>Next two, please step up.</i>

322
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:38,650
I'm a little nervous about this one...

323
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:41,700
- Jin Hyuk works out a lot so he'll be good.
- No, I don't.

324
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:45,580
[As usual, setting high expectations
for everyone.]

325
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:49,190
What are you two always planning?

326
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:53,750
They look so normal but act otherwise.

327
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:58,600
For the first time ever, we might
lose our Easy Brothers personalities today.

328
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,940
[Start]
- Wow!

329
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:05,180
[Powerful]

330
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,630
[As Kkuk predicted, Jin Hyuk is strong.]

331
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:13,350
Great job! You're doing a great job!

332
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:22,590
Woo Bin didn't do anything!

333
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:29,390
<i>Kim Woo Bin and Choi Jin Hyuk-
7.81 seconds.</i>

334
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:34,030
[Blue Team sweeps the first mission.]

335
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:39,380
<i>We will now hand three bankbooks
to the Blue Team.</i>

336
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:41,290
Okay!

337
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:51,660
- Really?
- There's a million won in here.

338
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:54,270
There's really money in there?

339
00:19:55,800 --> 00:20:00,940
<i>If you hold onto this throughout the
game, it will belong to whoever has it.</i>

340
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:05,040
<i>Say you do not earn
any bankbooks...</i>

341
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:07,750
<i>then that person loses all rights
to becoming an heir.</i>

342
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:11,550
<i>Now we will give one to
the losing team.</i>

343
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:14,130

694
00:45:19,670 --> 00:45:26,720
I didn't want to give the other
team a chance to splash you.

695
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:31,580
I would rather have splashed
you with my own hands.

696
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:39,490
All we have left is to
be held in water.

697
00:45:40,580 --> 00:45:44,860
Shin Hye is really cute when she talks.

698
00:45:44,860 --> 00:45:46,930
She does have that quality.

699
00:45:46,930 --> 00:45:49,370
She's the type who burns a man up.

700
00:45:49,370 --> 00:45:51,720
Do you want some?

701
00:45:55,970 --> 00:45:57,830
Do you think Shin Hye...

702
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:11,000
[Arrival at the park]

703
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:15,190
Since there's no swimming pool,
they gathered all the water here.

704
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:24,400
They set up a pool here. Amazing.

705
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:27,590
They made it here.

706
00:46:27,590 --> 00:46:29,430
I would do this in the winter too.

707
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:38,550
The next game is a mental one
between heirs.

708
00:46:38,550 --> 00:46:44,270
Each player will go up and fight
only with their heads.

709
00:46:44,270 --> 00:46:46,420
I was about to say that
just to be funny.

710
00:46:46,420 --> 00:46:48,610
- We fight with our heads?
- That's really it.

711
00:46:50,030 --> 00:46:53,280
You really must use your heads
and only your heads to fight.

712
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:59,540
We're going to start. Each time,
please push towards the middle.

713
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:04,110
When we count to three,
you can jump on the platform.

714
00:47:04,110 --> 00:47:06,420
Who wants to do it?

715
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:08,960
One, two, three.

716
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:11,760
- You can come up.
- I'll go.

717
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:15,140
Where are you going?

718
00:47:21,010 --> 00:47:24,310
So cold.

719
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:28,900
This is so much fun.

720
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:33,980
I have nothing to lose!

721
00:47:33,980 --> 00:47:35,560
Me neither!

722
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:38,380
It's been a while.

723
00:47:38,380 --> 00:47:42,190
Today will be your last day.

724
00:47:42,190 --> 00:47:44,890
- I don't think so.
- Who says?

725
00:47:44,890 --> 00:47:49,220
- I'm going to win.
- No I will.

726
00:47:49,220 --> 00:47:51,930
You look like beasts.

727
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:08,940
Ah, this hurts.
It hurts.

728
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:12,750
Good for you Dong Hoon!

729

- I don't want to lose.
- I don't either.

732
00:48:38,020 --> 00:48:41,100
I won't lose to you.

733
00:48:41,100 --> 00:48:43,060
I feel no pain in my head.

- You were kind of loud Kwang Soo.

Just be quiet.

750
00:50:45,070 --> 00:50:47,490
Then I'll be quiet.

751

You can't lose Woo Bin.

It hurts! It hurts!

You went in like a squid.

756
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:40,930
It was like a squid sliding
off a cutting board.

757
00:51:45,310 --> 00:51:47,700
How did he just go in like that?

758

We're going to see Mr. Lim Sung Hoon.

871

[Seems they just finished recording]
What did you record?

873
00:59:56,040 --> 00:59:57,840
Oh they were recording

It's been a while Mr. Yoo.

879
01:00:19,220 --> 01:00:21,680
You brought such good-looking
young men with you.

880
01:00:22,280 --> 01:00:25,110
You should be looking at me,
not at them.

881
01:00:25,110 --> 01:00:28,370
[Her eyes naturally go this way.]

882
01:00:29,730 --> 01:00:32,540

883
01:00:32,540 --> 01:00:36,230
Oh I was thinking that...

Sir, we're recording Running Man,
and I see that you have a document with you.

891
01:00:59,590 --> 01:01:01,950
But this envelope belongs to me.

892
01:01:02,390 --> 01:01:04,100
That can't be right.

893
01:01:04,100 --> 01:01:06,030
But it's the same as the one we have.

894
01:01:07,020 --> 01:01:09,600
It really is the same.

895
01:01:12,490 --> 01:01:17,130
These Kultwo show hosts
are R&B music men.

896
01:01:17,130 --> 01:01:20,320
We need to get a document from you.

897

- You need to give it to us.
- That's our mission.

898
01:01:23,870 --> 01:01:27,570
We can't just give it to you.
You have to do something.

899
01:01:27,570 --> 01:01:30,810
- Should we sing?
- Should we do a dance?

900

[An explosive response]

901
01:01:34,420 --> 01:01:40,060
This is also a visible radio,
so you can see this.

902
01:01:58,760 --> 01:02:01,110
Who wants to see Kim Jong Kook's abs?

903
01:02:03,430 --> 01:02:07,400
Abs! Abs! Abs!

904
01:02:09,630 --> 01:02:11,800
That's enough, that's enough.

We're really sorry about intruding...

Please choose a representative
to show how much you love Kultwo show.

907
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:25,140
Every time I release an album,
I come out on Kultwo show.

were no Kultwo radio? Kultwo!</i>

That was pretty good.

Who are you giving it to?

914
01:02:57,910 --> 01:03:00,790
We have to give it to
the team that showed up more.

915
01:03:00,790 --> 01:03:02,900
That's right.

916
01:03:02,900 --> 01:03:07,450
Also Jong Kook has always
been very supportive.

917

Why are you acting like this?

924
01:03:41,140 --> 01:03:46,110
So we just finished recording,
and you came.

925
01:03:46,110 --> 01:03:49,930
Usually when we finish,
coffee comes out.

926

- Really?
- We usually get coffee.

927

I don't want any. I change
my mind. I won't have any.

01:26:35,450 --> 01:26:38,180
Why does it say I can't use my account?

1211
01:26:38,180 --> 01:26:40,030
You put it in the wrong way.

1212
01:26:40,030 --> 01:26:44,720
What? How is this guy a successor?

1213
01:26:45,560 --> 01:26:49,860
Does someone know this is mine?
There's only W100.

1214
01:26:52,080 --> 01:26:56,720

01:27:20,970 --> 01:27:23,540
And W1,000.

1220
01:27:26,920 --> 01:27:30,670
It says there is no summary for my account.
Does that mean I have W1,000,000?

1221
01:27:30,670 --> 01:27:33,460
- You have W1,000,000.
- Right? Yes!

1222
01:27:34,270 --> 01:27:38,240

Nothing. Such variety.

01:28:20,660 --> 01:28:22,480
W100,000!

1232

We had such a great time with our heirs

1238
01:28:57,630 --> 01:29:00,360

How could you hit me?

1241
01:29:04,310 --> 01:29:06,400

1246
01:29:19,350 --> 01:29:20,460
He's scary.

I'm a girl...

01:29:47,080 --> 01:29:49,760
