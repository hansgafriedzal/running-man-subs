I only dance because you guys keep
playing the music for me.

21
00:01:06,606 --> 00:01:09,759
It's not like I dance when I shouldn't be.
How can this be a crime?

22
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,265
This is absolutely ridiculous.

Okay.

78
00:03:41,882 --> 00:03:44,523
Why have you put us behind
bars like this?

79
00:03:44,524 --> 00:03:46,457
What have we done so wrong
to deserve this?

80
00:03:46,458 --> 00:03:49,465
<i>You are all being detained in here
under suspicion</i>

81

- Let's put some fear into them.
- Okay, let's scare them a little.

[Just who could be the other suspects?]

00:04:48,337 --> 00:04:51,603
[He is today's eighth suspect.]

99
00:04:51,604 --> 00:04:54,032
- Don't you normally play a detective?
- Are you a detective, or a suspect?

100
00:04:54,058 --> 00:04:55,940
- Park Hee Soon.
- He still looks so cool.

101
00:04:55,941 --> 00:04:58,022
<i>Your crime is being too charismatic.</i>

102
00:05:01,651 --> 00:05:04,090
Why are you acting like that when
you're here like the rest of us?

103
00:05:04,797 --> 00:05:06,879
You're under arrest too then?

104
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,251
Even though you do still look very cool,
you're still here for being a suspect.

105
00:05:10,252 --> 00:05:12,116
What is it?
Is someone else here?

106
00:05:12,117 --> 00:05:14,162

He really is a friend of mine!

00:05:44,619 --> 00:05:47,329

- Get away from him.

117
00:05:47,668 --> 00:05:51,503
[Smart ass Ha Ha being denied of his claims
of being friends with Gong Yoo.]

118
00:05:52,688 --> 00:05:55,118
- I'm being serious.
- How is he a real friend of yours?

119
00:05:55,119 --> 00:05:56,286
I'm telling you, he is my friend.

120
00:05:56,366 --> 00:05:59,060
- Being close in age doesn't make you friends.
- Stop acting like you know him.

121
00:05:59,061 --> 00:06:02,571
- Get away from him.
- I'm serious! Tell them, Gong Yoo!

122
00:06:02,572 --> 00:06:03,884
[Begging Gong Yoo to admit
that they're friends.]

123
00:06:03,885 --> 00:06:05,311

<i>For setting the hearts of women
ages 10 to 50 on fire.</i>

128
00:06:20,652 --> 00:06:23,120
<i>That is the crime
you are guilty of committing.</i>

129
00:06:23,121 --> 00:06:25,712
Every single one of us has set
at least one woman's heart on fire.

130
00:06:25,713 --> 00:06:28,017
- I'm sorry.
- No, what would you be sorry for?

131
00:06:28,018 --> 00:06:29,492
- Let's take a look here.
- Sure.

132
00:06:29,493 --> 00:06:31,544
I've set quite a few fires myself
back in my day.

133
00:06:31,545 --> 00:06:33,288
Yes, he really did set some fires.

134
00:06:33,289 --> 00:06:35,666
[On fire? Seriously?]

135
00:06:35,667 --> 00:06:36,885
On fire?
You?

136
00:06:36,886 --> 00:06:40,662
He lit up some fire pits in neighboring towns
so that the elderly wouldn't get cold.

137
00:06:40,663 --> 00:06:42,177
That's the fire we meant.

138
00:06:42,178 --> 00:06:44,576
He's an actor,
and he was born in '79.

139
00:06:44,577 --> 00:06:46,353
- He was born in the same year as Ha Ha?
- Maybe you two really are friends.

140
00:06:46,354 --> 00:06:47,974
- I'm serious.
- Crime of arson.

141
00:06:47,975 --> 00:06:49,195
Being born in the same year
doesn't mean anything.

142
00:06:49,196 --> 00:06:52,025
You were just born the same year, don't go
around telling people that you're friends.

143
00:06:52,026 --> 00:06:53,749
Remember when you told us that
you're friends with Lee Jung Jae?

144
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:56,417
And you looked so awkward
sitting next to him.

145
00:06:57,763 --> 00:06:59,532
- What are you talking about?
- You're so right!

146
00:06:59,533 --> 00:07:01,703
- I saw that too.
- He doesn't know what he's saying.

147
00:07:01,704 --> 00:07:04,039
- Remember when we all went out to eat?
- What are you talking about?

148
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:07,127
When he said, 'Good to see you, Jae Suk',
you bent 90 degrees and bowed to him.

149
00:07:07,128 --> 00:07:08,604
[Same greeting but in a different pose.]

150
00:07:08,605 --> 00:07:11,082
- We saw you bowing to him.
- You bowed in middle of dinner.

151
00:07:11,083 --> 00:07:13,529
What are you guys talking about?
Jung Jae and I are really close.

152
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:15,819
What do you mean, you two are close?
You two aren't the least bit close.

153
00:07:16,039 --> 00:07:19,416
- Gong Yoo and I used to be very close.
- Stop being so absurd.

154
00:07:19,417 --> 00:07:21,025
- He and I used to get drinks together.
- Then why don't we ask him?

155
00:07:21,026 --> 00:07:22,991
Ask him.
Were you two really close?

156
00:07:24,205 --> 00:07:25,926
- I don't really remember.
- Wait!

157
00:07:26,261 --> 00:07:28,358
- I don't really remember.
- Wait!

158
00:07:30,577 --> 00:07:33,548
- How dare you try to fool us?
- You really have grown, Gong Yoo.

159
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,467
I've always been bigger than you.

160
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,847
[What a sense of humor.]

161
00:07:39,595 --> 00:07:42,914
[A difference of 15cm...
A huge difference in their height.]

162
00:07:42,915 --> 00:07:45,867
[Seeing the jokes flowing back and forth,
they really must be friends.]

163
00:07:45,868 --> 00:07:48,052
You keep him away, Jong Kook.
You keep him away.

164
00:07:48,053 --> 00:07:50,020
<i>To the new suspects who
have just joined us...</i>

165
00:07:50,106 --> 00:07:54,325
<i>We have prepared outfits befitting of your
new status in the dressing room.</i>

166
00:07:54,431 --> 00:07:57,609
- Please change into your new outfits.
- You two are dressed way too nicely.

167
00:07:57,610 --> 00:07:58,847
You two are dressed too nicely.

168
00:07:58,848 --> 00:08:00,748
And make sure to act like
the newcomers that you are.

169
00:08:00,749 --> 00:08:02,683
Know the order of seniority in here.

170
00:08:02,684 --> 00:08:06,483
- Let's let them change first.
- They need to change their clothes first.

171
00:08:06,484 --> 00:08:09,509
[A matching uniform that even these two
actors can't escape wearing.]

172
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:11,945
<i>- Do we really just change right here?
- Yes.</i>

173
00:08:13,313 --> 00:08:19,434
<i>All nine of you are in here at the moment
because you're guilty of your own crimes.</i>

174
00:08:19,809 --> 00:08:22,481
<i>All of you, who are suspected of
being guilty of your own crimes...</i>

175
00:08:22,482 --> 00:08:27,960
<i>we will now give you one last chance to
rid yourself of your accusations.</i>

176
00:08:28,689 --> 00:08:32,332
- The crimes that you are accused of...
- He's getting into his theatrical mode.

177
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:34,763
<i>You will be able to escape being framed
for your accusations.</i>

178
00:08:35,231 --> 00:08:39,665
<i>In order to win your freedom,
you will have to pass several missions first.</i>

179
00:08:40,886 --> 00:08:42,700
[Must pass several missions for a chance
to escape their accusations.]

180
00:08:42,701 --> 00:08:44,809
<i>In order to pass your missions...</i>

181
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:47,333
<i>you're going to need to
escape from here first.</i>

182
00:08:47,653 --> 00:08:50,545
<i>Put your heads together to come up
with a way to escape.</i>

183
00:08:50,858 --> 00:08:52,797
<i>The secret to your escape is
within this room.</i>

184
00:08:52,798 --> 00:08:55,123
- A secret?
- I bet it's a number. Let's find it.

185
00:08:55,124 --> 00:08:56,963
[Find the secret code to the lock!]

186
00:08:56,964 --> 00:08:58,676
- Seven!
- Number seven is circled.

187
00:08:58,677 --> 00:09:02,402
[There are so many numbers everywhere...]

188
00:09:02,403 --> 00:09:03,856
Could it be 8191?

189
00:09:03,857 --> 00:09:06,601
- Let's all think about this.
- We need to put our heads together.

190
00:09:07,056 --> 00:09:10,741
I don't think this is something that's
going to be all that simple.

191
00:09:10,742 --> 00:09:13,129
- Everyone come and put your heads together.
- Everyone gather around.

192
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:14,506
[Come put your heads together.
The answer is near.]

193
00:09:14,507 --> 00:09:16,728
Come and let's put our heads together.
We'll figure out the answer.

194
00:09:16,729 --> 00:09:18,458
- Okay, that's good.
- What are you doing, Hee Soon?

195
00:09:19,043 --> 00:09:21,836
[Even Hee Soon steps forward to put
his head together with the group.]

196
00:09:21,837 --> 00:09:23,213
- What could it be?
- What is it?

197
00:09:23,214 --> 00:09:24,936
What could it be?

198
00:09:26,006 --> 00:09:27,798
What's the answer?

199
00:09:28,205 --> 00:09:34,552
[Just... where... is the secret code?]

200
00:09:34,553 --> 00:09:36,497
We're going to have to figure this out.

201
00:09:36,727 --> 00:09:40,498
[Their escape route to the outside world
is proving to be difficult to open.]

202
00:09:41,178 --> 00:09:43,936
- There are seven blankets in here.
- Which movie are you currently working on?

203
00:09:43,937 --> 00:09:45,880
- 'The Suspect'.
- The Suspect?

204
00:09:45,881 --> 00:09:48,456
Then could the number be on a person?
On one of the suspects?

205
00:09:48,884 --> 00:09:52,711
[Could the hint be on a person?]

206
00:09:53,588 --> 00:09:55,683
- You think it's on our clothes?
- How could it be on our clothes?

207
00:09:57,028 --> 00:10:01,314
[The suspects are starting to
check out each other's clothing.]

208
00:10:01,315 --> 00:10:02,979
It can't be under our name tags, right?

209
00:10:03,768 --> 00:10:06,096
[Wait...]

210
00:10:06,097 --> 00:10:10,077
[Now that I think about it...]

211
00:10:10,078 --> 00:10:13,692
Don't you think it's weird that only the two
of them were asked to change in here?

212
00:10:14,964 --> 00:10:18,350
[Now that he's saying that...]

213
00:10:18,351 --> 00:10:20,909
- Take a look at their clothes.
- Look by the neck and other areas.

214
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:22,894
[Is that why Gong Yoo and Hee Soon were
asked to change in the room?]

215
00:10:22,895 --> 00:10:24,429
Can you take your clothes off
for a minute?

216
00:10:25,396 --> 00:10:27,313
- No, we're serious.
- I have a feeling it's on your clothes.

217
00:10:27,314 --> 00:10:28,564
I think the number is on their clothes.

218
00:10:32,673 --> 00:10:34,620
The number is right here!

219
00:10:35,874 --> 00:10:37,983
- On the back of this tab!
- On Gong Yoo's jacket!

220
00:10:37,984 --> 00:10:42,600
[A two digit number behind the tab!]

221
00:10:42,601 --> 00:10:44,318
- I think it's these two numbers.
- This is it.

222
00:10:44,319 --> 00:10:46,216
- Don't you think this is it?
- You really know your stuff.

223
00:10:46,217 --> 00:10:47,953
- See? This is it.
- Try 0628.

224
00:10:47,954 --> 00:10:50,031
- I knew there was something.
- The lock opened up!

225
00:10:50,032 --> 00:10:52,778
[Wow! The lock opened!]

226
00:10:52,779 --> 00:10:56,225
[The secret code was 06-28.
Indicated on the clothes of the suspects.]

227
00:11:01,499 --> 00:11:03,366
Come on, cheer with us!

228
00:11:06,199 --> 00:11:09,608
[However... they were all still clues
as to what lies ahead of them.]

229
00:11:09,609 --> 00:11:13,058
[The truth of a bloody battle that
awaited them right in this building.]

230
00:11:13,059 --> 00:11:15,147
[They're all still suspects- Can only
move when instructed by the guards.]

231
00:11:15,147 --> 00:11:16,974
I've only seen this on TV.

232
00:11:18,739 --> 00:11:20,339
<i>We will tell you about your
rules for the day.</i>

233
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:21,435
- Today's rules?
- Okay.

234
00:11:21,436 --> 00:11:25,505
<i>Your race for the day is...
The Suspect Target Race.</i>

235
00:11:25,506 --> 00:11:29,266
[The Suspect Target Race.]

236
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:33,090
[With the passing of each mission...]

237
00:11:33,091 --> 00:11:38,281
[They can earn themselves
a suspect target ballot.]

238
00:11:38,282 --> 00:11:45,113
[Can vote to target the suspect they want to
oust as many times as ballots they have.]

239
00:11:45,114 --> 00:11:48,286
[Rule- Can only eliminate the name tag of
the suspect whose name has been drawn.]

240
00:11:48,287 --> 00:11:51,454
[Only one person can remain to
earn their freedom at the end.]

241
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:54,850
[Unable to resist the temptation,
Yoo Hyuk plays a prank on Kwang Soo.]

242
00:11:55,405 --> 00:11:57,545
You guys always write down my name
whenever we do something like this.

243
00:11:57,546 --> 00:12:00,283
- You have us, so no need to worry.
- Seriously, don't do it.

244
00:12:00,284 --> 00:12:02,855
What is this?
Why do they want us to vote?

245
00:12:02,856 --> 00:12:06,647
[Name tag elimination and voting...
Just what fate awaits them?]

246
00:12:06,648 --> 00:12:09,163
What happens if we get a lot of votes?

247
00:12:09,164 --> 00:12:10,821
I'm not sure what's going on.

248
00:12:10,822 --> 00:12:12,928
Since the three of us are a team...

249
00:12:12,929 --> 00:12:16,669
We're not going to write down each other's
names just because we get a ballot, are we?

250
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:18,786
- Why are you even saying that?
- I know that this is unnecessary to say...

251
00:12:18,787 --> 00:12:22,086
The fact that you even brought that up means
you're going to write down one of our names.

252
00:12:22,087 --> 00:12:23,498
No, I'm not.

253
00:12:25,647 --> 00:12:27,499
[What? You're not?
'Gong Yoo.']

254
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:30,448
[You're not going to?
'Yoo Jae Suk.']

255
00:12:30,765 --> 00:12:33,790
[Suspect Target Race-
Arriving at their first mission location.]

256
00:12:37,054 --> 00:12:39,998
[Order message received.]

257
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:42,567
This is an explosive message.

258
00:12:42,568 --> 00:12:45,041
This message will self-destruct if you
don't read it within 15 seconds.

259
00:12:45,458 --> 00:12:47,637
<i>[Suspects- we want to see your action
on the water.]</i>

260
00:12:47,638 --> 00:12:50,039
<i>[Dump your opposing team members into
the water in a one-on-one match.]</i>

261
00:12:50,074 --> 00:12:54,138
<i>[The team that dumps all members of
an opposing team gets two ballots.]</i>

262
00:12:54,139 --> 00:12:55,847
<i>[Team that comes in at second place
gets one ballot.]</i>

263
00:12:55,847 --> 00:12:57,911
<i>- [Last place doesn't get any ballots.]
- Second place team gets two ballots.</i>

264
00:12:58,473 --> 00:13:01,196
- We have to make sure to get two ballots.
- The message already self-destructed.

265
00:13:01,196 --> 00:13:03,041
First team to arrive goes to final round.

266
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:05,540
[First team to change and arrive on scene
moves on to the final round.]

267
00:13:05,541 --> 00:13:08,371
First team to arrive has the advantage.
Let's hurry up and go, Suk Jin.

268
00:13:10,142 --> 00:13:11,682
First team to arrive goes to
the final round.

269
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:16,324
[First team to arrive by the 'R' flag
automatically goes to the final round.]

270
00:13:17,304 --> 00:13:20,194
<i>- Hurry up, Suk Jin!
- Hurry up and take off your pants!</i>

271
00:13:21,187 --> 00:13:23,786
Hurry, Hee Soon!

272
00:13:24,289 --> 00:13:26,572
[Gong Yoo is waiting for his pants
from his coordinator.]

273
00:13:26,573 --> 00:13:28,405
Hurry up and take off your pants!
There's no time!

274
00:13:30,608 --> 00:13:32,338
Suk Jin!

275
00:13:33,794 --> 00:13:35,395
- Ji Suk Jin!
- Coming!

276
00:13:41,978 --> 00:13:43,481
You want us to grab this?

277
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:48,778
<i>The Blue Team will go on to
the final round.</i>

278
00:13:48,779 --> 00:13:51,120
[Blue Team will move on to the final round.]

279
00:13:52,813 --> 00:13:54,157
Awesome.

280
00:13:54,158 --> 00:13:56,250
- You're very quick.
- To the final round!

281
00:13:56,711 --> 00:14:00,069
[And one very slow person...]

282
00:14:01,361 --> 00:14:03,249
Gong Yoo!
This is all your fault!

283
00:14:04,463 --> 00:14:06,362
The Blue Team got moved up
to the final round!

284
00:14:07,625 --> 00:14:10,326
I told you to just take your pants off
right where you were standing!

285
00:14:10,709 --> 00:14:12,193
Seriously, Gong Yoo.

286
00:14:12,194 --> 00:14:14,431
We could've been moved up to the final round
had you been a little quicker.

287
00:14:14,432 --> 00:14:17,086
I was trying to be quick when I
went into the dressing room

288
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:18,816
but there weren't any cameras in there.

289
00:14:18,817 --> 00:14:21,411
Did you expect them to be filming you when
you're stripping naked to change your clothes?

290
00:14:21,412 --> 00:14:23,984
- Well, I just thought...
- He's so naive!

291
00:14:23,985 --> 00:14:25,917
[Sweet and naive Gong Yoo.]

292
00:14:28,736 --> 00:14:32,015
<i>This will be a one-on-one match,
and it'll be an all-kill.</i>

293
00:14:32,016 --> 00:14:35,212
<i>If Gary beats his opponent, then he'll keep
on playing until he's defeated.</i>

294
00:14:35,213 --> 00:14:37,508
[First round-
Green Team vs. Red Team.]

295
00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:41,022
<i>Once you're on the bar, you
can't come down until you're defeated.</i>

296
00:14:41,541 --> 00:14:43,942
Ready.

297
00:14:44,163 --> 00:14:46,901
[First players up-
Green Team's Suk Jin vs. Red Team's Jae Suk.]

298
00:14:48,755 --> 00:14:50,926
- Show him, Suk Jin!
- Show him what?

299
00:14:51,438 --> 00:14:53,788
- Show him, Suk Jin!
- Show him what?

300
00:14:53,789 --> 00:14:57,118
[Jae Suk easily lifted himself up on
the bar like a roasted chicken.]

301
00:14:59,371 --> 00:15:02,787
[Slowly inching himself over above
Big-nose's head.]

302
00:15:07,356 --> 00:15:09,273
What are you doing, Suk Jin?

303
00:15:09,274 --> 00:15:11,131
I'm playing the game!

304
00:15:11,132 --> 00:15:12,637
Grab Jae Suk!

305
00:15:12,638 --> 00:15:15,757
[You want me to grab Jae Suk?]

306
00:15:15,758 --> 00:15:17,343
<i>Grab Jae Suk!</i>

307
00:15:17,947 --> 00:15:20,053
[Oh?]

308
00:15:27,841 --> 00:15:32,528
[Oh My God!]

309
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:51,331
No!

310
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:54,489
[A major catastrophe.]

311
00:15:58,691 --> 00:16:02,602
[Everyone bursts out in a fit of laughter.]

312
00:16:07,529 --> 00:16:09,194
Put my pants back on!

313
00:16:09,764 --> 00:16:11,185
Put my pants back on!

314
00:16:13,185 --> 00:16:15,405
- Put my pants back on!
- I don't know what to do!

315
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:19,665
[The pants are in Big-nose's hands.]

316
00:16:23,664 --> 00:16:24,910
[Kwang Soo's trying to put
a towel around him?]

317
00:16:31,293 --> 00:16:34,627
[Second huge catastrophe.]

318
00:16:39,275 --> 00:16:42,741
[It could've been big trouble...]

319
00:16:47,797 --> 00:16:51,282
[Fell in the water himself while
attempting to protect Jae Suk's modesty.]

320
00:16:52,530 --> 00:16:54,267
What is going on here?

321
00:16:54,564 --> 00:16:57,797
[No other choice but to
come down from the bar.]

322
00:16:57,798 --> 00:16:59,405
You almost pulled down my underwear!

323
00:16:59,406 --> 00:17:02,464
- What are you doing?
- Yoo Jae Suk is out.

324
00:17:02,465 --> 00:17:03,995
What do you mean, I'm out?

325
00:17:03,996 --> 00:17:05,911
I had my pants taken off!

326
00:17:05,912 --> 00:17:10,182
[Crime of corrupting the public is added
to his other crime of excessive dancing.]

327
00:17:10,368 --> 00:17:12,296
What were you thinking?

328
00:17:12,297 --> 00:17:14,187
- I was just trying to help.
- Tie your pants on tight around your waist.

329
00:17:14,579 --> 00:17:17,503
- Make sure you watch your pants.
- Look at Gong Yoo tightening up his pants.

330
00:17:17,959 --> 00:17:20,715
[Gong Yoo is quietly tightening up the
string around his waistline.]

331
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:23,541
[Hee Soon is suddenly quiet, and seems
busy doing something with his hands.]

332
00:17:23,829 --> 00:17:26,633
- Seriously...
- We won that round.

333
00:17:26,634 --> 00:17:29,345
- We won, we won!
- Their humiliation is our win.

334
00:17:29,652 --> 00:17:31,849
Their humiliation is our win.

335
00:17:34,391 --> 00:17:37,352
I'm really curious to see if Gong Yoo
can beat Ji Hyo or not.

336
00:17:37,353 --> 00:17:40,229
[Will Gong Yoo, the gentleman,
be able to beat Blank Ji?]

337
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:41,985
Wait, I'm not so sure about this.
Is it really okay for me to beat her?

338
00:17:41,986 --> 00:17:43,894
- Of course, show us your skills.
- Of course.

339
00:17:43,895 --> 00:17:45,865
Why are you saying something so weak?

340
00:17:46,727 --> 00:17:49,687
You can't look at Ji Hyo
like any other woman.

341
00:17:49,688 --> 00:17:51,490
[His opponent is our Ace,
who's better at games more than most men...]

342
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:52,797
Grab him.

343
00:17:53,691 --> 00:17:56,698
- What do I do here?
- Just dunk her, Gong Yoo!

344
00:17:56,699 --> 00:17:58,312
Drop her in the water!

345
00:17:59,084 --> 00:18:01,224
[Gong Yoo makes his way forward for now...]

346
00:18:01,225 --> 00:18:04,030
- I'm so sorry, so sorry.
- What do you have to be sorry about?

347
00:18:04,462 --> 00:18:08,355
[Gentleman Gong Yoo gently wrapping
his legs around Blank Ji.]

348
00:18:11,182 --> 00:18:13,552
- Drop her in the water!
- You have no other choice!

349
00:18:13,773 --> 00:18:15,663
[Blank Ji is starting to lose
strength in her arms.]

350
00:18:20,923 --> 00:18:23,539
[Blank Ji takes a dive.]

351
00:18:23,839 --> 00:18:25,470
You're doing great!

352
00:18:26,692 --> 00:18:30,601
[Next up is Gary,
the last player on the Green Team.]

353
00:18:30,602 --> 00:18:34,722
[If Gary falls in the water,
then the Red Team wins this round.]

354
00:18:35,752 --> 00:18:36,775
Gary.

355
00:18:40,314 --> 00:18:42,238
[A sudden change?]

356
00:18:56,538 --> 00:18:59,102
[Wow! Binds Gary within moments!]

357
00:18:59,103 --> 00:19:03,357
[Brings himself up and over
Random Mr. Capable in the blink of an eye!]

358
00:19:13,577 --> 00:19:18,429
[A simultaneous dive- His plan succeeds!]

359
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:23,996
Gong Yoo!
Gong Yoo!

360
00:19:25,339 --> 00:19:28,834
[An astounding play that showed off
his mannerism and strength all at once!]

361
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:31,349
You're no joke, Gong Yoo!
Great job!

362
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:33,631
<i>Red Team wins.</i>

363
00:19:33,632 --> 00:19:35,384
[Red Team wins.]

364
00:19:35,385 --> 00:19:38,078
[Off to the final round-
Blue Team vs. Red Team.]

365
00:19:38,553 --> 00:19:41,476
- Do you want to go first?
- Do you really need to do all that?

366
00:19:41,477 --> 00:19:44,154
[Coach Kkuk preparing for his play.]

367
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:49,588
[First players up-
Blue Team's Hee Soon vs. Red Team's Jae Suk.]

368
00:19:49,589 --> 00:19:51,463
[Game start]

369
00:19:53,217 --> 00:19:55,679
[First player up for the Blue Team is,
Charismatic Hee Soon.]

370
00:20:03,127 --> 00:20:06,553
[Something about him is giving off
the 'Big-nose' vibe...]

371
00:20:06,993 --> 00:20:11,416
[Charismatic Hee Soon's flustered footwork.]

372
00:20:14,335 --> 00:20:16,148
[Look at this guy.]

373
00:20:17,365 --> 00:20:20,022
[Where are you going?]

374
00:20:20,324 --> 00:20:22,440
<i>You're disqualified if you
get off the bar.</i>

375
00:20:23,161 --> 00:20:25,140
- Go forward a bit.
- I can't.

376
00:20:25,141 --> 00:20:26,469
I can't.

377
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:30,693
- You'll be more comfortable if you go up.
- Wrap your legs up around it.

378
00:20:30,694 --> 00:20:32,092
[Hanging will make it easier to last longer.]

379
00:20:32,093 --> 00:20:33,378
Lift up your legs.

380
00:20:36,483 --> 00:20:38,642
Is it that you can't wrap your
legs around it?

381
00:20:38,643 --> 00:20:40,179
What are you doing?

382
00:20:42,724 --> 00:20:44,174
Are you okay?

383
00:20:51,091 --> 00:20:54,058
[Self-submersion after a shouting cry.]

384
00:20:58,798 --> 00:21:00,552
What are you doing?

385
00:21:02,665 --> 00:21:06,326
[Charismatic Hee Soon's
weak physical strength.]

386
00:21:12,451 --> 00:21:14,028
Wow, this is really slippery.

387
00:21:14,029 --> 00:21:15,400
[Blue Team's second player- Ha Ha.]

388
00:21:15,401 --> 00:21:16,842
This is really slippery.
This is bad.

389
00:21:16,843 --> 00:21:18,580
You can wipe it down with the towel.

390
00:21:18,581 --> 00:21:20,612
[The game is momentarily paused
due to the slippery bar.]

391
00:21:24,478 --> 00:21:26,406
What are you doing, Hee Soon?

392
00:21:29,298 --> 00:21:31,682
Are you trying to tickle the bar
or something?

393
00:21:31,683 --> 00:21:34,754
- What are you doing with that towel?
- Don't you even know how to do it?

394
00:21:34,755 --> 00:21:36,830
[An actor who belies his image
with his bumbling actions.]

395
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:38,680
- He's really adorable.
- Come on, Hee Soon.

396
00:21:38,681 --> 00:21:40,686
Just stop it!
Stop it.

397
00:21:40,687 --> 00:21:42,817
Hee Soon just told us to do it quietly.

398
00:21:42,818 --> 00:21:45,017
As if he's shooing everyone away.

399
00:21:49,314 --> 00:21:52,798
[Red Team's Jae Suk vs. Blue Team's Ha Ha.
Time to start their game.]

400
00:21:53,125 --> 00:21:55,179
Jong Kook's going to have to
do all the work.

401
00:21:56,170 --> 00:21:58,462
[A dropkick?]

402
00:22:00,602 --> 00:22:03,515
[A high kick with all the rage
that's been building up for years.]

403
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,613
[An excited crowd of onlookers.]

404
00:22:10,614 --> 00:22:12,176
One more time.

405
00:22:12,177 --> 00:22:13,892
One more time.
Wrap your legs around him.

406
00:22:14,474 --> 00:22:16,486
[There they go!]

407
00:22:28,164 --> 00:22:31,732
[Ultimately caught...]

408
00:22:34,199 --> 00:22:37,234
[Let's both you and I die together!]

409
00:22:42,291 --> 00:22:44,764
[Ha Ha and Jae Suk fall in simultaneously.]

410
00:22:44,765 --> 00:22:47,239
[Yoo Hyuk eliminated
two of his opponents.]

411
00:22:47,959 --> 00:22:49,868
Here, grab onto my hand.

412
00:22:54,189 --> 00:22:56,230
Why aren't you saving me first?

413
00:22:57,842 --> 00:23:02,458
<i>Okay, the remaining players are,
Kim Jong Kook, Lee Kwang Soo, and Gong Yoo.</i>

414
00:23:03,015 --> 00:23:05,586
I had no idea that Hee Soon
would be this bad.

415
00:23:07,544 --> 00:23:09,385
Hee Soon, are you okay?

416
00:23:10,015 --> 00:23:11,331
Are you okay?

417
00:23:11,694 --> 00:23:13,154
[Just go.]

418
00:23:14,817 --> 00:23:16,313
Why can't you even say anything?

419
00:23:16,986 --> 00:23:19,946
[Dropping to the base of the bar
without a word.]

420
00:23:19,947 --> 00:23:22,324
How can I step on him?
Come here, Ha Ha.

421
00:23:23,275 --> 00:23:25,431
- Let's do it together.
- Hee Soon, he says he can't step on you.

422
00:23:25,432 --> 00:23:28,719
- I can't step on you, Hee Soon.
- Let me do this at least!

423
00:23:29,219 --> 00:23:30,640
Let me do this at least!

424
00:23:30,641 --> 00:23:33,517
[Hee Soon's voice can finally be heard.]

425
00:23:33,926 --> 00:23:35,480
He wants to be able to do
that at least.

426
00:23:37,201 --> 00:23:40,287
[Weak older brother wants to be able
to help his teammates in some way.]

427
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:42,967
- He wants to be able to do that at least.
- Hee Soon, you're so cool.

428
00:23:45,725 --> 00:23:48,607
[Red Team's Kwang Soo getting ready
to climb up on the bar.]

429
00:23:48,608 --> 00:23:53,978
[His plan is to get up on the bar
by kicking himself off.]

430
00:23:53,979 --> 00:23:55,420
Okay, push me off.

431
00:23:55,421 --> 00:23:57,153
One, two, three.

432
00:24:06,595 --> 00:24:10,273
[What the...]

433
00:24:11,613 --> 00:24:14,881
[Kwang Soo lost
after all that commotion...]

434
00:24:16,591 --> 00:24:18,836
- What is he doing?
- Kwang Soo is disqualified.

435
00:24:18,837 --> 00:24:20,922
What are you doing?

436
00:24:23,555 --> 00:24:26,989
[Kkuk is now able to compete against Gong Yoo
without having done anything.]

437
00:24:27,398 --> 00:24:29,386
- Gong Yoo.
- Jong Kook has the advantage.

438
00:24:29,387 --> 00:24:30,728
Oh my goodness.

439
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:34,819
[Crawling across the bar?]

440
00:24:35,511 --> 00:24:39,588
[Tiger is at an advantageous position.]

441
00:24:41,307 --> 00:24:42,755
[Darn...]

442
00:24:55,419 --> 00:24:57,567
You're going to get flipped around
if you keep that up, Jong Kook.

443
00:24:59,461 --> 00:25:01,958
[Tiger in danger!]

444
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,606
[The time is now!]

445
00:25:05,688 --> 00:25:08,678
[A flustered Tiger!]

446
00:25:08,679 --> 00:25:12,044
[Gong Yoo's onslaught.]

447
00:25:13,182 --> 00:25:17,455
[It's on!
Tiger vs. Gong Yoo!]

448
00:25:19,873 --> 00:25:21,189
We have to win!

449
00:25:22,523 --> 00:25:24,196
No, Jong Kook!

450
00:25:25,385 --> 00:25:26,820
We have to win!

451
00:25:27,196 --> 00:25:30,594
[The two men are still hanging on
with their impressive strength!]

452
00:25:34,013 --> 00:25:36,702
Attack Jong Kook's legs.
You can do it, Gong Yoo!

453
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:38,931
[Gong Yoo, gritting down on his teeth.]

454
00:25:38,932 --> 00:25:41,505
Jong Kook lost his advantage
when he got flipped around on the bar.

455
00:25:41,851 --> 00:25:44,158
No, Jong Kook!
You're our last hope!

456
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:46,214
Hee Soon was never our hope!

457
00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:53,342
[Just who will win this battle?]

458
00:25:56,718 --> 00:25:58,862
Jong Kook is about to fall off!

459
00:26:00,209 --> 00:26:02,471
[Mr. Capable is in danger!]

460
00:26:02,472 --> 00:26:07,717
[But he's still able to withstand this attack
with tremendous amount of strength!]

461
00:26:11,494 --> 00:26:13,830
[Mr. Capable sticks his head in
between Gong Yoo's legs!]

462
00:26:13,831 --> 00:26:17,240
[Supports himself with his head...]

463
00:26:17,241 --> 00:26:20,565
[And tries to unwrap Gong Yoo's legs
from around the bar!]

464
00:26:24,209 --> 00:26:26,197
[And one last arm...]

465
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:36,219
[Mr. Capable ultimately wins!]

466
00:26:38,846 --> 00:26:40,865
[The onlookers are left speechless.]

467
00:26:41,589 --> 00:26:44,653
[No different than an iron wall of strength-
His name is, Coach Kkuk.]

468
00:26:44,654 --> 00:26:47,178
We lost because of you!

469
00:26:47,179 --> 00:26:50,555
[If Kwang Soo had depleted Mr. Capable
of even the smallest bit of energy...]

470
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:53,556
Wow, Kim Jong Kook.

471
00:26:55,193 --> 00:26:59,776
<i>The members of the Red Team each get one
ballot for having come in at second place.</i>

472
00:27:00,331 --> 00:27:02,455
Remember what we talked about earlier.
No writing each other's names down.

473
00:27:02,456 --> 00:27:04,481
- Of course.
- That's a given, Jae Suk.

474
00:27:04,482 --> 00:27:08,070
- We have to write down the strongest person.
- Of course.

475
00:27:08,439 --> 00:27:10,071
We don't know what's going to happen,
but that's what we should do.

476
00:27:10,141 --> 00:27:12,807
For example, there's no need whatsoever to
write down Hee Soon's name.

477
00:27:12,808 --> 00:27:16,542
Hee Soon?
Don't even bother writing down his name.

478
00:27:17,766 --> 00:27:19,165
I don't know.

479
00:27:19,166 --> 00:27:21,357
[Voting for their most
formidable opponent, Jong Kook.]

480
00:27:25,611 --> 00:27:27,354
[Kwang Soo too?]

481
00:27:28,197 --> 00:27:30,930
<i>[Gong Yoo]</i>

482
00:27:31,548 --> 00:27:33,405
[This naive man doesn't even know
what just happened.]

483
00:27:33,406 --> 00:27:34,478
Let's go.

484
00:27:34,513 --> 00:27:37,077
[He'll realize what it's like to feel betrayed
once he sees this episode being aired.]

485
00:27:37,162 --> 00:27:41,950
<i>Each member of the Blue Team gets two
ballots for coming in at first place.</i>

486
00:27:41,951 --> 00:27:44,166
- Two ballots each?
- Well...

487
00:27:44,167 --> 00:27:48,197
Kwang Soo really is someone whom we
should eliminate as soon as possible...

488
00:27:48,198 --> 00:27:50,733
Let's all each write down
Kwang Soo's name first.

489
00:27:50,734 --> 00:27:52,386
[Rid themselves of the traitor?
Each to write down Kwang Soo's name.]

490
00:27:52,387 --> 00:27:55,621
[Then how about their other
remaining ballot?]

491
00:27:56,185 --> 00:27:58,062
[Pondering over their vote.]

492
00:28:01,366 --> 00:28:03,084
[Huh?]

493
00:28:04,981 --> 00:28:07,010
- What's that?
- Who's over there?

494
00:28:08,376 --> 00:28:10,078
- What's that?
- Who's over there?

495
00:28:10,662 --> 00:28:12,436
I can see the red coat.

496
00:28:12,437 --> 00:28:15,006
[Gong Yoo caught eavesdropping.]

497
00:28:15,007 --> 00:28:17,305
[Women's dressing room.]

498
00:28:17,306 --> 00:28:20,211
[Flustered and almost walked into
the women's dressing room by mistake.]

499
00:28:20,212 --> 00:28:22,505
Why are you acting so flustered?

500
00:28:23,389 --> 00:28:25,237
Look at you trying to eavesdrop.

501
00:28:26,474 --> 00:28:28,681
Sorry I have to say this,
but don't try anything.

502
00:28:29,552 --> 00:28:31,159
- I'm seriously trying to tell you.
- What?

503
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,322
- Don't write me down.
- Who, me?

504
00:28:32,323 --> 00:28:34,345
You need to hide better, Kwang Soo.

505
00:28:35,343 --> 00:28:37,307
[This is what you call being inconspicuous?]

506
00:28:38,132 --> 00:28:40,032
[Write down Jong Kook's name.]

507
00:28:41,903 --> 00:28:44,525
- Lee Kwang Soo, we're writing you down.
- I'm writing it down now, Lee Kwang Soo.

508
00:28:44,526 --> 00:28:47,350
[The two biggest figures of betrayal
on RM- Haroro and Giraffe.]

509
00:28:47,351 --> 00:28:49,586
I swear that I didn't
write your name down, Jong Kook.

510
00:28:49,587 --> 00:28:51,146
Stop lying to me.

511
00:28:51,297 --> 00:28:53,700
[Jong Kook gives both
of his votes to the Giraffe.]

512
00:28:53,701 --> 00:28:55,939
I wrote down Gong Yoo's name.

513
00:28:56,106 --> 00:28:58,070
- Hey, Gong Yoo's standing right behind you.
- What did you say?

514
00:28:58,071 --> 00:28:59,298
[What?]

515
00:29:02,276 --> 00:29:06,212
[Weakling Hee Soon is targeting both
Kwang Soo and Jae Suk with one vote each.]

516
00:29:07,258 --> 00:29:12,038
[Traitor Haroro votes for Kwang Soo...]

517
00:29:12,039 --> 00:29:15,381
[And Jong Kook!]

518
00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:30,010
- What is it?
- Ha Ha just sent me a text.

519
00:29:30,444 --> 00:29:32,456
[We need to pick one person
to target...]

520
00:29:32,457 --> 00:29:34,836
[As guessed, he's up to no good...]

521
00:29:35,454 --> 00:29:38,455
I'll start a group chatting room,
and I'll leave Jong Kook out of it.

522
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,276
[Starting to plot their plan of betrayal!]

523
00:29:41,276 --> 00:29:43,506
<i>[Kwang Soo: I've started a group chat
without 'you-know-who'.]</i>

524
00:29:43,506 --> 00:29:45,710
<i>[Jae Suk: Okay.
K.S.: Let's talk comfortably without him.]</i>

525
00:29:45,711 --> 00:29:48,602
<i>[Ha Ha: Sounds good.]</i>

526
00:29:48,913 --> 00:29:52,039
<i>[Lee Kwang Soo: Today's the day, everyone.
Ha Ha: Who did you write down, Hee Soon?]</i>

527
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,036
- Is that sent to me privately?
- Wait a minute.

528
00:29:54,037 --> 00:29:55,591
What are you doing?

529
00:29:56,303 --> 00:29:58,698
I just got a private text.

530
00:29:58,699 --> 00:30:01,623
- You can't say that out loud.
- Who are you texting right now?

531
00:30:01,624 --> 00:30:04,247
- I was just texting someone.
- See? This is the text I just received.

532
00:30:06,733 --> 00:30:08,706
[These scoundrels!]

533
00:30:09,324 --> 00:30:11,229
[Fine... you want to see how far
we can take this?]

534
00:30:11,967 --> 00:30:14,645
<i>[Kim Jong Kook: Kwang Soo... Don't
even think about trying anything funny.]</i>

535
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:17,941
<i>[Kim Jong Kook: I know what you're doing.]</i>

536
00:30:17,942 --> 00:30:19,809
He says he knows what you're doing.

537
00:30:19,846 --> 00:30:21,862
<i>[Kwang Soo: What, Jong Kook?
What are you talking about?]</i>

538
00:30:21,863 --> 00:30:23,426
<i>[Kim Jong Kook: You better shut down
that group chat right now.]</i>

539
00:30:23,426 --> 00:30:24,540
He totally caught you.

540
00:30:26,351 --> 00:30:28,271
[I don't know anything.]

541
00:30:31,326 --> 00:30:34,363
What else could I say when Jong Kook is
talking about finishing you off?

542
00:30:34,364 --> 00:30:36,346
I have no more reasons to help you
if you keep acting like this.

543
00:30:36,347 --> 00:30:37,890
[What fate awaits for the Giraffe?]

544
00:30:40,098 --> 00:30:43,501
[Eul-wang-li Beach.]

545
00:30:44,417 --> 00:30:48,312
[Razor sharp winds seem to be
especially fiercely today...]

546
00:30:57,084 --> 00:30:59,680
- It's another explosive message.
- It self-destructs after 15 seconds, right?

547
00:30:59,681 --> 00:31:00,874
This time...

548
00:31:01,308 --> 00:31:03,535
<i>[We're going to test your ability
to escape.]</i>

549
00:31:03,536 --> 00:31:05,845
<i>[Even though you may be accustomed
to your prison...]</i>

550
00:31:05,846 --> 00:31:08,367
<i>[there are quite a few things you need
to know about your escape routes.]</i>

551
00:31:08,368 --> 00:31:11,060
<i>But only two of those rooms are
programmed as escape routes.</i>

552
00:31:11,061 --> 00:31:12,808
<i>So you need to escape
as soon as the door opens</i>

553
00:31:12,809 --> 00:31:15,868
<i>and open up the lock to the bun steamer
that you will see outside.</i>

554
00:31:16,928 --> 00:31:19,912
<i>There's only one keep that will
unlock the padlock to the bun steamer.</i>

555
00:31:19,913 --> 00:31:22,426
- But the key is...
- Oh no! The message exploded already.

556
00:31:22,427 --> 00:31:24,060
What about the key?

557
00:31:24,667 --> 00:31:26,240
Wow, that wind is no joke.

558
00:31:26,829 --> 00:31:28,389
What's this?

559
00:31:28,390 --> 00:31:30,272
- Where's the key?
- Wow, it's cold.

560
00:31:30,273 --> 00:31:32,395
[Everyone walks through the cold wind
to walk into the container room.]

561
00:31:32,396 --> 00:31:35,245
- Don't you want to eat that steamed bun?
- I really want that steamed bun.

562
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:37,079
- I'm hungry.
- I really want that steamed bun.

563
00:31:37,231 --> 00:31:38,808
Wow, it's cold.

564
00:31:42,076 --> 00:31:44,001
I'm hungry!
I'm hungry!

565
00:31:44,002 --> 00:31:46,711
[The nine suspects are locked up
in the container room together.]

566
00:31:46,712 --> 00:31:49,751
<i>Only one of those keys you see on the
table unlocks the bun steamer.</i>

567
00:31:49,752 --> 00:31:50,793
Okay, we understand.

568
00:31:50,828 --> 00:31:55,003
<i>If you pick the wrong key, then
you have to go back into the container.</i>

569
00:31:55,004 --> 00:31:56,135
Okay, we understand.

570
00:31:56,136 --> 00:31:58,974
What if Kim Jong Kook is the only one who
goes in and out of this place?

571
00:31:58,975 --> 00:32:01,131
- What are you talking about?
- It's always just Kim Jong Kook.

572
00:32:01,132 --> 00:32:03,493
[Loud and chaotic container room.]

573
00:32:03,494 --> 00:32:08,054
<i>For example, if Kim Jong Kook comes out
and picks the correct key...</i>

574
00:32:08,055 --> 00:32:10,582
<i>then every member of the Blue Team
passes this mission.</i>

575
00:32:10,583 --> 00:32:13,040
[Whomever opens up the lock
frees up rest of their teammates.]

576
00:32:13,206 --> 00:32:17,089
[Coaching addict starts strategizing
without a moment of hesitation.]

577
00:32:17,090 --> 00:32:18,994
[Everyone gathers with their own
teammates to strategize.]

578
00:32:19,335 --> 00:32:21,314
<i>We will now start the first round.</i>

579
00:32:21,315 --> 00:32:22,646
[First round- Start!]

580
00:32:23,994 --> 00:32:26,081
[An immediate dance scene.]

581
00:32:27,692 --> 00:32:31,243
[Escape plans are far out of their minds-
These suspects are only feeling the rhythm.]

582
00:32:31,244 --> 00:32:33,408
[The mood is getting heated up!]

583
00:32:34,914 --> 00:32:37,180
[A hot club scene in the container!]

584
00:32:39,786 --> 00:32:42,073
[Everyone dancing with each other
in this club scene.]

585
00:32:42,074 --> 00:32:43,423
There it is!

586
00:32:44,317 --> 00:32:46,500
[Gong Yoo's sly pranks.]

587
00:32:48,018 --> 00:32:51,366
[No signs of the escape door opening.]

588
00:32:51,367 --> 00:32:54,150
[No sign of them even
wanting to escape...]

589
00:32:55,897 --> 00:32:57,968
[So fun!]

590
00:32:59,558 --> 00:33:02,233
- This is it!
- I hear it!

591
00:33:03,786 --> 00:33:05,974
[One of the doors are about to open!]

592
00:33:07,936 --> 00:33:10,986
[A quick escape out the door!]

593
00:33:10,987 --> 00:33:13,935
[Just who will it be?]

594
00:33:15,432 --> 00:33:17,878
[Huh?]

595
00:33:19,009 --> 00:33:20,544
[Big-nose Brother's body was first
to crawl out the door...]

596
00:33:20,545 --> 00:33:23,048
[But Hee Soon slides over him
to escape first!]

597
00:33:24,150 --> 00:33:26,842
[Blue Team's Hee Soon makes his escape!]

598
00:33:27,403 --> 00:33:29,252
[So close...]

599
00:33:29,253 --> 00:33:31,852
- Yes, Hee Soon!
- He's so fast!

600
00:33:31,853 --> 00:33:33,916
You were just saving up
your strength earlier, weren't you?

601
00:33:34,806 --> 00:33:36,352
[Of course!]

602
00:33:37,532 --> 00:33:40,014
- What happened, Suk Jin?
- Someone pulled me back.

603
00:33:40,015 --> 00:33:41,625
Make sure to pick the right one.

604
00:33:41,626 --> 00:33:44,385
<i>You have to think very careful about this
because you only have one chance.</i>

605
00:33:44,386 --> 00:33:47,762
<i>The moment you touch one of the keys,
that's the key that you have to choose.</i>

606
00:33:47,763 --> 00:33:49,927
- Hee Soon!
- Fighting!

607
00:33:49,928 --> 00:33:52,797
- Hee Soon, you have to do this at least!
- No!

608
00:33:54,433 --> 00:33:56,704
- One, two, three. Make your choice.
- The one to the left!

609
00:33:56,705 --> 00:33:58,592
No, Hee Soon.
Pick whichever one you want.

610
00:33:58,593 --> 00:34:00,047
Go with your gut feeling.

611
00:34:00,048 --> 00:34:02,717
[He's made his decision.]

612
00:34:02,718 --> 00:34:05,318
[If the lock opens up,
then rest of the Blue Team can escape.]

613
00:34:05,319 --> 00:34:07,417
- Please!
- Hee Soon made his choice.

614
00:34:07,418 --> 00:34:08,948
<i>- Please!
- Hee Soon made his choice.</i>

615
00:34:09,208 --> 00:34:13,358
[Hm?]

616
00:34:18,468 --> 00:34:22,942
[It won't open...]

617
00:34:22,943 --> 00:34:24,828
- It's not it.
- It didn't open!

618
00:34:24,829 --> 00:34:26,459
- Okay, we're good.
- Come on, Hee Soon.

619
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:27,659
We're set.

620
00:34:27,694 --> 00:34:30,598
Then are you taking that key out,
or are you mixing that back in?

621
00:34:30,599 --> 00:34:32,438
- We're taking that key out.
- Okay!

622
00:34:32,439 --> 00:34:34,211
[The key that was just chosen
is to be taken out of the mix.]

623
00:34:34,212 --> 00:34:35,953
Wow, he's so fast.

624
00:34:35,954 --> 00:34:38,518
[Everyone is shocked at the speed
of Hee Soon's movement.]

625
00:34:39,456 --> 00:34:40,944
<i>Are you all ready?</i>

626
00:34:40,945 --> 00:34:42,070
[Ready]

627
00:34:43,913 --> 00:34:46,806
[A sexy song for this selection.]

628
00:34:47,645 --> 00:34:49,433
[Gong Yoo's solo dance?]

629
00:34:51,542 --> 00:34:54,589
[No, that's better.
Please don't be good at dancing too.]

630
00:34:54,974 --> 00:34:58,265
[Park Hee Soon's solo performance?
Park Hee Soon- Come Back Boy.]

631
00:34:58,266 --> 00:34:59,607
Park Hee Soon, Come Back Boy.

632
00:35:00,708 --> 00:35:02,171
No, don't do that, Hee Soon.

633
00:35:02,172 --> 00:35:05,506
[Weakling Hee Soon-
His dance brakes are malfunctioning.]

634
00:35:05,507 --> 00:35:07,202
No, no... not yet.

635
00:35:09,927 --> 00:35:11,182
Here we go!

636
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:14,332
[Let's go.]

637
00:35:14,333 --> 00:35:17,947
[The heat of their dancing is making them
forget about the icy winds.]

638
00:35:22,614 --> 00:35:24,968
[Prudent Gong Yoo is discreetly searching
for an escape route even in this situation.]

639
00:35:31,683 --> 00:35:33,487
[The music ends.]

640
00:35:38,224 --> 00:35:40,802
[Already escaping through the opened door.]

641
00:35:43,673 --> 00:35:46,891
[Park Hee Soon again!]

642
00:35:46,892 --> 00:35:50,896
[He really is quick...]

643
00:35:52,370 --> 00:35:53,914
Let me do this at least!

644
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:59,291
[He may not have the strength,
but he has the speed?]

645
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:00,899
He doesn't have 'soon'
in his name for nothing.

646
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:02,413
Park Hee-Speedy.

647
00:36:02,831 --> 00:36:06,046
[With his quick feet, his new name is,
Park Hee-Speedy.]

648
00:36:07,262 --> 00:36:09,887
[As soon as a door opens up...]

649
00:36:09,888 --> 00:36:13,044
[He appears out of nowhere
to shoot through the opening.]

650
00:36:15,183 --> 00:36:19,860
[The key that Park Hee-Speedy
chose this time...]

651
00:36:19,861 --> 00:36:24,768
[Will it open the lock on the
bun steamer?]

652
00:36:26,106 --> 00:36:29,202
[Fail]

653
00:36:31,183 --> 00:36:32,444
It didn't work!

654
00:36:32,445 --> 00:36:33,588
Come on back!

655
00:36:33,589 --> 00:36:37,303
[He did have the speed...]

656
00:36:37,304 --> 00:36:39,418
- Why can't he pick the right one?
- Luck isn't on his side.

657
00:36:42,052 --> 00:36:43,381
<i>Is everyone ready?</i>

658
00:36:43,382 --> 00:36:45,043
<i>Are you all ready!</i>

659
00:36:46,882 --> 00:36:50,620
[Everyone's is excited to hear
a familiar Turbo song.]

660
00:36:50,621 --> 00:36:52,997
- Here it comes!
- Get in the middle!

661
00:36:53,789 --> 00:36:56,664
[Here he comes, Mr. Turbo man.]

662
00:37:00,412 --> 00:37:01,588
Kim Jong Kook!

663
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:05,567
[Dance addict suspect always
wanting to take the center stage.]

664
00:37:05,567 --> 00:37:07,274
What are you doing?

665
00:37:09,001 --> 00:37:11,314
[Ha Ha's spastic dance.]

666
00:37:16,524 --> 00:37:17,865
That's good.

667
00:37:20,050 --> 00:37:22,622
[Oh... not bad?]

668
00:37:23,983 --> 00:37:26,669
[Haroro's got the feel for it now.
On the spot dance choreography.]

669
00:37:28,331 --> 00:37:31,245
[His spastic dance is pretty entertaining.]

670
00:37:31,246 --> 00:37:32,789
Hey, this is fun!

671
00:37:35,348 --> 00:37:37,728
[Just then...]

672
00:37:37,729 --> 00:37:38,893
[The siren is activated!]

673
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:43,685
[Where's the open escape route?]

674
00:37:45,884 --> 00:37:47,577
[There it is!]

675
00:37:58,453 --> 00:38:01,108
[This time, it's Gong Yoo!]

676
00:38:02,318 --> 00:38:04,835
[Excited Red Team.]

677
00:38:08,845 --> 00:38:11,558
[Seven keys left remaining.]

678
00:38:12,276 --> 00:38:14,638
- Gong Yoo!
- You have to choose carefully!

679
00:38:15,654 --> 00:38:16,655
Okay, that's the one.

680
00:38:16,656 --> 00:38:19,274
[Chooses a key.]

681
00:38:19,936 --> 00:38:21,982
It's not going to be that easy.

682
00:38:22,592 --> 00:38:23,920
Please let this one be it.

683
00:38:25,857 --> 00:38:27,162
Please!

684
00:38:28,836 --> 00:38:33,374
[Will the padlock open?]

685
00:38:41,296 --> 00:38:42,712
I got it!

686
00:38:42,713 --> 00:38:44,167
- Seriously!
- It opened!

687
00:38:45,673 --> 00:38:48,294
[It opened!]

688
00:38:48,803 --> 00:38:50,439
- Seriously!
- It opened!

689
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:52,065
- Seriously?
- It opened?

690
00:38:55,947 --> 00:38:59,245
[Wow... it really opened!]

691
00:38:59,246 --> 00:39:00,554
- Kwang Soo!
- It opened!

692
00:39:00,555 --> 00:39:02,266
- Kwang Soo, let's get out of here.
- It opened!

693
00:39:02,868 --> 00:39:05,806
[The entire Red Team escapes!]

694
00:39:06,231 --> 00:39:08,665
[How can this be...]

695
00:39:09,235 --> 00:39:10,364
We did it!

696
00:39:10,365 --> 00:39:12,483
I feel a little disappointed because
I did want to dance a bit more.

697
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:14,568
I can't believe that opened.

698
00:39:15,293 --> 00:39:17,375
- Which one is that?
- It's the pizza flavor.

699
00:39:17,376 --> 00:39:20,582
[The winners get cold weather's best snack-
A nice and warm steamed bun!]

700
00:39:21,859 --> 00:39:24,378
[I vow to escape out of here...]

701
00:39:33,970 --> 00:39:36,908
[Give me just one bite!]

702
00:39:36,909 --> 00:39:39,346
[Their own slice of heaven.]

703
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,078
Just give me one bite!

704
00:39:45,528 --> 00:39:47,258
[Just one bite...]

705
00:39:47,846 --> 00:39:49,469
[Oh? Gentleman Gong Yoo heads
toward the container?]

706
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:51,086
[Huh?]

707
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:54,395
[You are one cruel man...]

708
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:56,583
You're so annoying!

709
00:39:57,607 --> 00:39:59,332
Ugh, it's so cold.

710
00:39:59,333 --> 00:40:03,022
- Okay... is everyone ready?
- Yes!

711
00:40:03,022 --> 00:40:05,626
I just had a steamed bun,
and it's really delicious!

712
00:40:05,904 --> 00:40:08,684
[If you want one of these,
you must escape out of there!]

713
00:40:08,995 --> 00:40:10,772
Mr. Park Hee-Speedy,
let me hear you scream!

714
00:40:10,773 --> 00:40:12,498
Yeah!

715
00:40:13,871 --> 00:40:18,003
[At least the music is upbeat!
Dancing to the rhythm of DOC!]

716
00:40:30,226 --> 00:40:32,998
[Is that the jiang-shi dance?]
(Jiang-shi=Chinese vampires that hops.)

717
00:40:37,135 --> 00:40:39,934
[It's a dance scene on the
outside as well.]

718
00:40:47,493 --> 00:40:49,736
[It's the siren!]

719
00:40:50,727 --> 00:40:53,495
[Where's the door?]

720
00:40:54,495 --> 00:40:57,742
[Here it is!]

721
00:41:02,064 --> 00:41:05,299
[An escaped Tiger!]

722
00:41:06,246 --> 00:41:09,635
- The Green Team never once made it out.
- What are you Green Team members doing?

723
00:41:09,636 --> 00:41:12,553
I was trying to get out,
but he's just way too strong!

724
00:41:13,837 --> 00:41:15,504
We're no match for his strength.

725
00:41:15,505 --> 00:41:19,586
[Will this key work?]

726
00:41:20,781 --> 00:41:23,383
- I have a good feeling about this.
- I have a bad feeling about this.

727
00:41:24,227 --> 00:41:28,683
- Just use your strength!
- One, two, three!

728
00:41:28,684 --> 00:41:32,040
[This man has opened up a lock with the use
of his strength alone before...]

729
00:41:32,075 --> 00:41:33,593
How is that even possible?

730
00:41:34,426 --> 00:41:36,874
I think it's going to turn.
That's the feeling I'm getting.

731
00:41:36,875 --> 00:41:39,622
[Will it open?]

732
00:41:40,815 --> 00:41:42,940
[The icy winds are making his eyes tear up.]

733
00:41:45,836 --> 00:41:47,516
It opened!

734
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:50,658
[It opened!]

735
00:41:50,659 --> 00:41:52,239
It opened!

736
00:41:54,326 --> 00:41:57,385
[The entire Blue Team escapes!]

737
00:41:57,386 --> 00:41:59,377
Can you give us just one
steamed bun?

738
00:41:59,378 --> 00:42:01,454
[Can't hear you!]

739
00:42:01,455 --> 00:42:03,950
- You don't eat things like that, Jong Kook.
- This is okay.

740
00:42:03,951 --> 00:42:06,206
- Which flavor is that one?
- I'm not sure.

741
00:42:07,773 --> 00:42:10,392
Just take a small bite.
How can a girl take such a huge bite?

742
00:42:10,393 --> 00:42:12,413
There's nothing better than
a steamed bun in the winter.

743
00:42:12,755 --> 00:42:15,461
- It's literally melting the chill off of me.
- Isn't it good?

744
00:42:15,462 --> 00:42:17,990
<i>The Red Team gets two voting ballots.</i>

745
00:42:18,241 --> 00:42:20,380
<i>And the Blue Team gets one voting ballot.</i>

746
00:42:20,381 --> 00:42:23,220
<i>And the Green Team doesn't get any
voting ballots this time either.</i>

747
00:42:24,706 --> 00:42:26,571
[Time to vote.]

748
00:42:26,572 --> 00:42:28,490
Even though we don't know what it is,
just write it down for now.

749
00:42:28,491 --> 00:42:32,701
[Even though they don't what it is yet,
just write down Kim Jong Kook's name?]

750
00:42:32,702 --> 00:42:34,383
I'm not sure if writing this is a good thing.

751
00:42:34,384 --> 00:42:37,050
[And the last remaining vote...]

752
00:42:40,962 --> 00:42:43,669
[Jae Suk?]

753
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:49,686
[Gong Yoo?]

754
00:42:53,974 --> 00:42:56,981
[Kwang Soo...]

755
00:43:01,156 --> 00:43:02,504
- Please show it to the camera.
- Okay.

756
00:43:02,539 --> 00:43:05,864
[Figures...]

757
00:43:07,235 --> 00:43:09,019
- You didn't write me down, right?
- Of course not.

758
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:10,253
- Really?
- I really didn't write you down.

759
00:43:10,635 --> 00:43:11,964
It really wasn't you.

760
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:15,876
[Kkuk's only target is Lee Kwang Soo?]

761
00:43:15,877 --> 00:43:17,440
Let me borrow your back.

762
00:43:19,547 --> 00:43:22,669
[Kim Jong Kook- This is his way of
thanking him for lending him his back?]

763
00:43:23,371 --> 00:43:27,573
[Park Hee-Speedy chooses...]

764
00:43:27,574 --> 00:43:30,134
[Chooses Kwang Soo again!]

765
00:43:40,012 --> 00:43:41,846
I'm just not sure...

766
00:43:42,251 --> 00:43:44,600
Is this how it always...

767
00:43:45,340 --> 00:43:47,816
I feel like this is the blockbuster
of all variety shows.

768
00:43:48,071 --> 00:43:51,089
I never knew this show was so big
with this many staff members.

769
00:43:53,003 --> 00:43:55,409
[On to the next location!]

770
00:43:56,536 --> 00:43:58,923
[Driving time without a doubt means
it's time to text.]

771
00:43:58,924 --> 00:44:01,775
<i>[Kwang Soo: I trust you, Ha Ha.
Ha Ha: You can trust me.]</i>

772
00:44:02,117 --> 00:44:03,648
<i>[Kwang Soo: Thanks to all of you
for all your hard work.]</i>

773
00:44:03,648 --> 00:44:05,139
<i>[Ha Ha: Traitors!
Kwang Soo: Today is the day, Ha Ha.]</i>

774
00:44:05,139 --> 00:44:07,712
What are you chatting about now?
What are you planning?

775
00:44:07,713 --> 00:44:09,024
I'm not planning anything.

776
00:44:09,374 --> 00:44:12,765
- I'm just chatting with the Blue Team a bit.
- Really?

777
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:16,793
[A secret chat amongst the
Traitors Club.]

778
00:44:16,794 --> 00:44:19,206
'We only have one goal'?

779
00:44:22,015 --> 00:44:24,522
<i>[Kwang Soo: Today is the day.
Ha Ha: Traitors!</i>

780
00:44:25,083 --> 00:44:26,672
Ha Ha.

781
00:44:26,992 --> 00:44:29,816
Why am I the only one not
getting any texts?

782
00:44:30,353 --> 00:44:32,613
[No answer, only silence.]

783
00:44:34,674 --> 00:44:38,350
But he's not...
very trustworthy, is he?

784
00:44:38,853 --> 00:44:41,362
[That's true...]

785
00:44:42,501 --> 00:44:45,447
Ha Ha is like an expert when it comes to
scheming up these plans.

786
00:44:45,864 --> 00:44:47,783
<i>[Suk Jin: Traitors' Club, fighting!
Jae Suk: Kang Soo...]</i>

787
00:44:47,784 --> 00:44:48,827
<i>[Kwang Soo: Yes, Jae Suk?]</i>

788
00:44:48,828 --> 00:44:52,268
[Kang Soo? Jae Suk is unable to resist
teasing Kwang Soo again.]

789
00:44:53,020 --> 00:44:54,519
I'm in the middle of an
important conversation.

790
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:56,776
If you're going to be saying things like this,
then I'd like for you to leave this chat.

791
00:44:56,777 --> 00:44:59,136
- What am I doing?
- What is with 'Cho Kang Soo, Oh Kang Soo'?

792
00:44:59,137 --> 00:45:00,687
I'm in the midst of an important meeting.

793
00:45:00,688 --> 00:45:02,744
[Cho Kang Soo...]

794
00:45:04,874 --> 00:45:07,529
<i>[Gong Yoo: Will we be
able to do this tomorrow too?]</i>

795
00:45:07,530 --> 00:45:09,606
<i>[Jae Suk: No,
but I'm sure we can do something.]</i>

796
00:45:09,607 --> 00:45:12,270
<i>[Kim Jong Kook: This won't do...]</i>

797
00:45:12,271 --> 00:45:16,563
<i>[Park Hee Soon: I feel like death, and
I'm confused. They want more tomorrow?]</i>

798
00:45:19,439 --> 00:45:21,384
[Arriving at the next mission location.]

799
00:45:21,385 --> 00:45:23,055
['D' Museum in Incheon.]

800
00:45:23,814 --> 00:45:26,338
- Did we get it?
- We've got a message.

801
00:45:26,339 --> 00:45:30,093
<i>[How about some rest time since you've all
been working so hard to earn your ballots?]</i>

802
00:45:30,426 --> 00:45:34,919
<i>[You can share the snack your opposing team
holds in their hand while hoola hooping.]</i>

803
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:39,563
<i>[If the snack falls or breaks, it won't count,
so you must be careful not to do either.]</i>

804
00:45:39,952 --> 00:45:42,389
- I'm really bad at hoola hoops.
- I'm bad at it too.

805
00:45:42,752 --> 00:45:45,536
- What is it that you're good at?
- I've got nothing.

806
00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:48,559
People are going to think that I'm
an airhead who can't even do anything.

807
00:45:50,553 --> 00:45:54,793
<i>[The first team to finish the snack will
receive three voting ballots.]</i>

808
00:45:54,794 --> 00:45:57,531
<i>[Second placed team gets two ballots,
and the last team gets one ballot each.]</i>

809
00:45:57,850 --> 00:46:00,515
The team that finishes the snack gets
three ballots and the last team gets one.

810
00:46:00,516 --> 00:46:01,988
Three ballots is a huge deal.

811
00:46:01,989 --> 00:46:04,204
The first team to arrive can choose
which team they'll compete against.

812
00:46:04,205 --> 00:46:06,253
We can choose who to compete against
if we're the first team to arrive.

813
00:46:09,154 --> 00:46:12,048
- Where do we have to go?
- Let's go. Let's try to win this time.

814
00:46:13,586 --> 00:46:14,967
We have to eat a snack?

815
00:46:17,752 --> 00:46:19,851
[Red Team is the first team to arrive.]

816
00:46:19,852 --> 00:46:22,045
- What is this?
- While doing the hoola hoop...

817
00:46:22,046 --> 00:46:23,280
I didn't really understand earlier.

818
00:46:23,315 --> 00:46:26,594
You can't drop the hoola hoop,
and the first team to finish eating wins.

819
00:46:26,595 --> 00:46:28,330
[Does he even understand the mission?]

820
00:46:29,008 --> 00:46:32,146
- Wow, you're good.
- I can even walk while doing it.

821
00:46:32,147 --> 00:46:33,894
[Gong Yoo- An expert in hoola hoops?]

822
00:46:34,557 --> 00:46:36,497
Jong Kook's really bad with
the hoola hoop.

823
00:46:37,539 --> 00:46:40,715
[Everyone starts to practice their hoola hoop
skills as soon as they arrive.]

824
00:46:40,716 --> 00:46:43,450
- This isn't really working.
- Why don't you give it a try, Hee Soon?

825
00:46:44,026 --> 00:46:46,565
- This is hard.
- Why can't I do this?

826
00:46:46,566 --> 00:46:48,629
You can't do it either?

827
00:46:53,249 --> 00:46:54,394
[Ah...]

828
00:46:57,102 --> 00:46:59,270
He really can't do anything.

829
00:47:12,985 --> 00:47:15,453
- How are you so good at that?
- Kang Gary's good at it.

830
00:47:15,820 --> 00:47:17,137
[So envious...]

831
00:47:17,138 --> 00:47:19,987
<i>However, you're going to be spinning
the hoola hoop with your arm.</i>

832
00:47:21,449 --> 00:47:23,907
[Awful hoola hoopers are overjoyed.]

833
00:47:23,908 --> 00:47:25,679
That's so much better!

834
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:30,175
[If it's spinning with the arm, then
there's a better chance of winning!]

835
00:47:30,677 --> 00:47:33,521
- Do you see the numbers in front of you?
- Yes.

836
00:47:33,876 --> 00:47:36,073
<i>You must choose one of them.</i>

837
00:47:36,074 --> 00:47:38,081
[Numbers one through four.
What kind of a snack will they find inside?]

838
00:47:38,082 --> 00:47:40,035
What kind of a snack is inside?

839
00:47:40,036 --> 00:47:41,937
I bet it's something difficult.

840
00:47:41,938 --> 00:47:43,922
- It can't be anything that'll break.
- Number one.

841
00:47:44,615 --> 00:47:46,227
Let's go with number two, Jae Suk.

842
00:47:46,228 --> 00:47:48,882
Number two?
Okay, number two!

843
00:47:51,012 --> 00:47:53,012
[Number two- Celery!]

844
00:47:53,859 --> 00:47:56,299
- This won't break very easily.
- That's not going to break easily.

845
00:47:56,300 --> 00:47:58,164
So the faster we spin, the better for us?

846
00:47:58,962 --> 00:48:00,960
<i>If you want your team to win...</i>

847
00:48:00,961 --> 00:48:03,544
[Mr. Capable spinning
the hoop at a warp speed.]

848
00:48:04,469 --> 00:48:08,869
[You can't spin it that fast...]

849
00:48:08,870 --> 00:48:10,438
You guys really are too much.

850
00:48:10,439 --> 00:48:12,389
Okay, you can't let your arm
get too tired.

851
00:48:12,704 --> 00:48:16,125
- I actually want Hee Soon to do it.
- I wish Hee Soon would spin for us.

852
00:48:16,126 --> 00:48:17,228
[Red Team only wants Hee Soon.]

853
00:48:17,229 --> 00:48:20,511
[Mr. Capable is already battle ready.]

854
00:48:21,201 --> 00:48:24,311
You know what I think?
I think Jae Suk should go first.

855
00:48:24,312 --> 00:48:25,666
No, that's okay.

856
00:48:26,369 --> 00:48:28,214
- I feel like I'd get beat up.
- I know.

857
00:48:28,215 --> 00:48:30,684
Stop being afraid
and let's just do this.

858
00:48:31,472 --> 00:48:33,538
[Red Team's challenge.]

859
00:48:34,764 --> 00:48:37,394
[Jong Kook starting off slowly?]

860
00:48:42,959 --> 00:48:45,596
[Giraffe training session
with the celery stick?]

861
00:48:49,934 --> 00:48:51,746
It hurts!

862
00:48:51,747 --> 00:48:54,144
[Who knew that being hit
with a celery stick could hurt?]

863
00:48:54,321 --> 00:48:56,283
[Even the tears are starting to well up?]

864
00:48:56,284 --> 00:48:58,038
No, I think we're doing fine.

865
00:49:01,162 --> 00:49:04,668
[Trainer and Giraffe's battle
over the celery stick.]

866
00:49:05,787 --> 00:49:07,826
- He keeps hitting me with the celery stick.
- I won't do that anymore.

867
00:49:07,826 --> 00:49:09,764
My whole face smells like parsley now.

868
00:49:10,008 --> 00:49:11,971
- I mean, celery.
- Okay, I heard you.

869
00:49:12,895 --> 00:49:15,852
[At least know what you're
being beaten up with...]

870
00:49:16,798 --> 00:49:18,800
- Kim Jong Kook, you're being warned.
- Okay, I got it.

871
00:49:19,003 --> 00:49:21,428
[With Jong Kook's warning,
the Blue Team switches our their player.]

872
00:49:21,429 --> 00:49:23,354
You have to give it a try too.
Here, you do it.

873
00:49:23,355 --> 00:49:25,624
What's so difficult about doing this?
Go on and do it.

874
00:49:26,150 --> 00:49:28,746
It's Hee Soon's show.
It's time for Hee Soon's show.

875
00:49:28,747 --> 00:49:30,124
[It's once again time for,
Park Hee Soon's show.]

876
00:49:30,125 --> 00:49:31,198
Practice and give it a try.

877
00:49:34,024 --> 00:49:36,317
[There he goes again...]

878
00:49:36,318 --> 00:49:39,138
[People watching are even more
nervous for him...]

879
00:49:39,716 --> 00:49:41,693
This is Park Hee Soon's show.

880
00:49:42,926 --> 00:49:45,097
[Okay, he's got the feel for it now.]

881
00:49:45,893 --> 00:49:47,493
You have to spin your wrist.
There you go.

882
00:49:50,334 --> 00:49:52,330
- He's making me nervous.
- Okay, ready!

883
00:49:52,331 --> 00:49:54,294
[Red Team's second attempt.]

884
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:01,003
[But he's still not giving up.]

885
00:50:01,004 --> 00:50:04,420
- You just need to spin it.
- Hee Soon's never played this before.

886
00:50:09,817 --> 00:50:12,939
[Murderous hoola hoop.]

887
00:50:14,945 --> 00:50:18,265
[After all those nerve-wracking spins,
at last...]

888
00:50:19,348 --> 00:50:21,763
[Still not giving up- Another attempt.]

889
00:50:21,764 --> 00:50:22,796
There you go.

890
00:50:23,283 --> 00:50:25,726
[Oh... finally seems to have
gotten the hang of it.]

891
00:50:26,992 --> 00:50:28,531
This isn't easy to eat.

892
00:50:28,532 --> 00:50:30,955
[Trying to chase the celery with his tongue.]

893
00:50:34,548 --> 00:50:38,080
[The key to success is to control the
distance between the hoop and the celery!]

894
00:50:43,180 --> 00:50:46,143
[Oh! He gets it in his mouth!]

895
00:50:47,603 --> 00:50:50,178
[A fierce tooth brushing
with the celery stick!]

896
00:50:50,179 --> 00:50:52,340
[Hee Soon's spins are slowly starting to
become bigger and bigger.]

897
00:50:52,341 --> 00:50:54,223
This is really dangerous.

898
00:50:55,125 --> 00:50:57,275
[Total concentration.]

899
00:51:03,563 --> 00:51:05,095
[He may have it...]

900
00:51:05,096 --> 00:51:07,310
[Or maybe not...]

901
00:51:07,311 --> 00:51:09,117
[Erupting in annoyance.]

902
00:51:09,236 --> 00:51:11,512
Whatever, this is exhausting me too.

903
00:51:12,822 --> 00:51:15,131
Take your turn, Gong Yoo!
Get in there!

904
00:51:15,132 --> 00:51:16,917
[Calm]

905
00:51:17,985 --> 00:51:20,219
[Hee Soon seems to be slowly losing
the strength in his arm as well.]

906
00:51:23,162 --> 00:51:25,660
[Only 30 seconds left on the clock!]

907
00:51:28,992 --> 00:51:31,494
[Ugh, this is exhausting.]

908
00:51:35,260 --> 00:51:37,518
[Ouch...]

909
00:51:38,195 --> 00:51:39,909
He stopped spinning.
It hasn't been a minute, right?

910
00:51:40,508 --> 00:51:42,736
[Gong Yoo asking for a referee time.]

911
00:51:44,196 --> 00:51:47,031
[But it's still time out- Red Team fails.]

912
00:51:47,032 --> 00:51:48,110
<i>Okay, the Blue Team.</i>

913
00:51:48,111 --> 00:51:49,976
Okay Hee Soon.
Let's go with number four.

914
00:51:51,026 --> 00:51:52,158
[Number Four]

915
00:51:52,159 --> 00:51:54,431
[Chewy candy stick]

916
00:51:55,066 --> 00:51:57,589
- Isn't that chewy candy stick?
- Chewy candy sticks are good.

917
00:51:57,590 --> 00:51:59,370
[A nostalgic snack that
they haven't seen in a long time.]

918
00:51:59,371 --> 00:52:01,029
It's something that Jong Kook can't eat!

919
00:52:02,553 --> 00:52:04,797
That's not an easy thing to bite off.

920
00:52:04,798 --> 00:52:06,325
[That won't be easy to eat since
it'll be so hard to bite off...]

921
00:52:06,326 --> 00:52:07,720
[I will get my revenge for earlier.]

922
00:52:07,721 --> 00:52:10,158
- Rock, paper, scissors to see who'll go?
- Why don't you go first, Hee Soon?

923
00:52:10,159 --> 00:52:12,597
[Respecting the elder to go first only
at times like this?]

924
00:52:12,598 --> 00:52:15,062
This could be something
that you're good at, Hee Soon.

925
00:52:15,063 --> 00:52:16,270
[Blue Team's challenge.]

926
00:52:16,271 --> 00:52:17,574
This could be the thing that
you're good at.

927
00:52:18,766 --> 00:52:20,889
[Hmm...]

928
00:52:25,387 --> 00:52:28,857
[All over his face as if he's applying
makeup with a brush.]

929
00:52:31,959 --> 00:52:34,225
I'm not even looking right now.

930
00:52:35,704 --> 00:52:38,414
[A little bit... just a little bit more...]

931
00:52:47,196 --> 00:52:49,955
[Seems to be annoyed.
Going for the bite with gusto.]

932
00:52:52,632 --> 00:52:54,956
I'm seriously not looking.
I have no idea what's going on.

933
00:53:00,319 --> 00:53:02,185
[Oh!]

934
00:53:05,479 --> 00:53:07,783
[Blue Team's Park Hee Soon succeeds!]

935
00:53:09,625 --> 00:53:12,044
[It's now Kkuk's turn.]

936
00:53:14,085 --> 00:53:18,177
[The Giraffe immediately gets worked up
at the sight of the Tiger.]

937
00:53:20,726 --> 00:53:23,666
[Extreme desire for revenge.]

938
00:53:23,667 --> 00:53:25,525
What's wrong with him?

939
00:53:27,314 --> 00:53:29,534
[Come and get it!]

940
00:53:32,533 --> 00:53:34,815
[Slowly inching backwards.]

941
00:53:37,228 --> 00:53:41,200
[Tiger-phobia.
Following his instinct to inch away.]

942
00:53:41,877 --> 00:53:44,811
Why are you backing away?
He has to do this right.

943
00:53:45,506 --> 00:53:47,783
I've stopped the time for now.
Okay, start again.

944
00:53:53,815 --> 00:53:56,925
[Oh... so that's how you're
going to play?]

945
00:54:02,695 --> 00:54:05,324
[Whatever! Let's just
attack the Giraffe's front paw!]

946
00:54:06,843 --> 00:54:08,874
Don't you think that this is
just too much?

947
00:54:10,645 --> 00:54:14,253
[Impossible for the Tiger to succeed
as long as the Giraffe is the one spinning.]

948
00:54:14,601 --> 00:54:16,450
[Green Team's turn.]

949
00:54:16,451 --> 00:54:18,558
- Three ballots for the team in first place?
- Three ballots?

950
00:54:18,559 --> 00:54:20,039
- Three ballots to the winning team.
- We need to win this one.

951
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:22,779
We haven't come in at first place
in anything at all today.

952
00:54:22,780 --> 00:54:24,443
We haven't had a single ballot all day.

953
00:54:25,644 --> 00:54:28,708
[Let's see here...]

954
00:54:30,293 --> 00:54:32,623
We're at an advantage right now
from having the most number of ballots.

955
00:54:32,624 --> 00:54:34,852
We have to pick one person to target.

956
00:54:34,853 --> 00:54:36,471
[Gong Yoo, having heard
the Blue Team's meeting earlier.]

957
00:54:36,739 --> 00:54:38,857
- We all have to write down Kwang Soo.
- Let's all give one vote to Kwang Soo.

958
00:54:38,858 --> 00:54:41,049
How about Jae Suk and Gong Yoo?

959
00:54:42,290 --> 00:54:45,559
[If the Blue Team is
trying to eliminate me...]

960
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:48,825
[Then it'll be dangerous for
the Blue Team to come in at first place...]

961
00:54:49,928 --> 00:54:52,574
[In that case...]

962
00:54:52,575 --> 00:54:56,142
[It may actually be better for
the Green Team to come in at first place...]

963
00:54:58,789 --> 00:55:01,495
- Look at what a gentleman he is.
- Look at how nice he is being to Ji Hyo.

964
00:55:01,496 --> 00:55:03,392
[He's spinning it VERY slowly.]

965
00:55:03,393 --> 00:55:05,813
[Hurry up and eat it, Ji Hyo.]

966
00:55:09,969 --> 00:55:12,107
[She truly is our Ace!
Eating it from the side, which is easier!]

967
00:55:12,730 --> 00:55:14,903
[Ace Blank Ji immediately succeeds!]

968
00:55:16,637 --> 00:55:19,450
[Time for the Big-nosed Brother!]

969
00:55:19,451 --> 00:55:20,956
Gong Yoo is being too nice.

970
00:55:21,785 --> 00:55:24,044
Green Team needs to come in
at first place.

971
00:55:26,748 --> 00:55:28,659
[Even the Big-nosed Brother
easily succeeds.]

972
00:55:28,660 --> 00:55:31,222
[Now only Gary needs to succeed for
the Green Team to come in at first place.]

973
00:55:31,223 --> 00:55:33,304
Hey, what you're doing could
be a good plan.

974
00:55:33,305 --> 00:55:37,825
The reason being, it could be better for the
Green Team to win rather than the Blue Team.

975
00:55:39,503 --> 00:55:44,579
What you don't know is that the Green Team
would probably write down your name.

976
00:55:45,423 --> 00:55:47,183
- You need to think carefully.
- How much of that is left?

977
00:55:47,184 --> 00:55:51,201
[Perhaps thinking that it's too easy,
Gong Yoo suddenly speeds up his spinning.]

978
00:55:57,539 --> 00:55:59,587
[Mr. Gary also succeeds!]

979
00:56:00,517 --> 00:56:04,733
[Green Team comes in at first place,
and wins themselves three ballots each!]

980
00:56:06,249 --> 00:56:08,505
[Only Hee Soon is left in order
for the Blue Team to succeed!]

981
00:56:08,506 --> 00:56:10,099
This won't be good, right?

982
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:11,431
I really can't be doing this.

983
00:56:13,954 --> 00:56:16,939
[His face seems to have aged
since earlier this morning...]

984
00:56:17,667 --> 00:56:19,648
[Even Gong Yoo seems to be
pretty exhausted.]

985
00:56:23,018 --> 00:56:24,147
<i>40 seconds left.</i>

986
00:56:27,369 --> 00:56:28,760
One bite!

987
00:56:29,867 --> 00:56:33,240
[Smacking himself in the head with
the hoola hoop.]

988
00:56:34,837 --> 00:56:37,607
- 15 seconds left on the clock.
- 15 seconds is plenty of time.

989
00:56:38,249 --> 00:56:39,562
Watch it carefully...

990
00:56:39,563 --> 00:56:42,219
[Gong Yoo's spin have slowed down considerably
from being too exhausted with the spinning.]

991
00:56:44,084 --> 00:56:45,684
[Park Hee Soon succeeds!]

992
00:56:46,802 --> 00:56:49,608
[Blue Team comes in at second place
and wins themselves two ballots!]

993
00:56:49,909 --> 00:56:52,497
[Time to cast their final votes.]

994
00:56:52,498 --> 00:56:54,865
- We have to vote for the strongest player.
- We each have to vote for Jong Kook.

995
00:56:55,689 --> 00:56:58,204
We have to get rid of
the traitors quickly as well.

996
00:56:58,205 --> 00:56:59,716
- Let's vote for Kwang Soo too.
- Okay.

997
00:56:59,717 --> 00:57:03,527
[It's soon time for the individual battle!
Off to vote in secrecy.]

998
00:57:06,084 --> 00:57:08,943
[Thinking even more carefully since
they were given three voting ballots.]

999
00:57:10,610 --> 00:57:12,910
I have a feeling that you and I
will get our share of the votes.

1000
00:57:13,944 --> 00:57:16,384
I don't think there's any need for
you and I to vote for each other.

1001
00:57:16,588 --> 00:57:18,897
I don't think any of the members on
the Green Team have gotten any votes yet.

1002
00:57:18,898 --> 00:57:22,340
We need to spread out the votes a bit, or
one person could have too much of an edge.

1003
00:57:22,341 --> 00:57:24,270
[Aha... have to spread out the votes?]

1004
00:57:24,634 --> 00:57:28,069
[Just what will these ballots determine?]

1005
00:57:29,367 --> 00:57:37,195
[The voting that went on all day long...
The secret behind it will soon be revealed.]

1006
00:57:39,248 --> 00:57:42,458
This is going to be our last mission location.
What is all that voting going to do?

1007
00:57:42,826 --> 00:57:45,732
Guys, should we all be honest and
tell each other who we just voted for?

1008
00:57:46,684 --> 00:57:49,538
- I just voted for Ha Ha.
- I voted for Hee Soon.

1009
00:57:49,539 --> 00:57:51,446
I voted for Gary.

1010
00:57:51,702 --> 00:57:56,445
So we all spread out our votes?
They're all people whom I didn't even suspect.

1011
00:57:56,445 --> 00:57:58,695
I don't think Ji Hyo's received any votes.

1012
00:57:58,696 --> 00:58:01,065
Yes, it's very possible that
Ji Hyo didn't get any votes.

1013
00:58:01,066 --> 00:58:03,174
I have a feeling that Suk Jin
voted for her.

1014
00:58:06,135 --> 00:58:10,253
I know that I always say this to our guests
before we go into this battle...

1015
00:58:10,254 --> 00:58:15,295
But when we go into the name tag elimination,
you can't let it get personal or disappointed.

1016
00:58:15,296 --> 00:58:16,760
[Don't feel disappointed no matter what.]

1017
00:58:16,761 --> 00:58:18,834
Is it an individual race now?

1018
00:58:18,867 --> 00:58:21,298
Yes, it is an individual race now.

1019
00:58:21,696 --> 00:58:25,159
[Arriving back at the same location where
they were locked up this morning.]

1020
00:58:25,160 --> 00:58:28,183
<i>We will now start the individual race.</i>

1021
00:58:28,184 --> 00:58:30,345
<i>You must all find a hiding place
and await the order announcement.</i>

1022
00:58:30,346 --> 00:58:32,885
- What is it now?
- So it's an individual race?

1023
00:58:34,118 --> 00:58:35,485
I'm nervous.

1024
00:58:36,048 --> 00:58:38,175
I really feel like
this is finally Running Man.

1025
00:58:39,281 --> 00:58:41,241
What is this?

1026
00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:43,250
There are a ton of boxes in here.

1027
00:58:43,251 --> 00:58:45,747
I can just hide in one of these.

1028
00:58:48,471 --> 00:58:51,000
[What is Hee Soon doing with
that refrigerator?]

1029
00:58:51,713 --> 00:58:53,914
[Are you trying to get in there?]

1030
00:58:53,915 --> 00:58:57,201
[Children and immature adults should not
imitate what he's doing.]

1031
00:58:58,107 --> 00:59:00,280
My reflection is going to
show off of the window.

1032
00:59:01,714 --> 00:59:09,806
<i>I will now...
announce your final mission.</i>

1033
00:59:11,331 --> 00:59:13,436
<i>Your final mission.</i>

1034
00:59:14,445 --> 00:59:17,520
<i>Suspect Target Race.</i>

1035
00:59:18,156 --> 00:59:20,702
<i>Eliminate the target's name tag.</i>

1036
00:59:21,459 --> 00:59:23,176
<i>Every time you completed a mission</i>

1037
00:59:23,177 --> 00:59:27,183
<i>you all got to cast your vote for
one of your fellow suspects.</i>

1038
00:59:27,580 --> 00:59:34,137
<i>The order of person targeted will be
determined by the number of votes received.</i>

1039
00:59:34,781 --> 00:59:36,051
Ah, the person with the
most votes?

1040
00:59:36,052 --> 00:59:41,331
<i>Oust your target in the order that they're
determined by the number of votes received.</i>

1041
00:59:41,562 --> 00:59:43,421
Is there any other way around it?

1042
00:59:43,421 --> 00:59:46,471
<i>You can't eliminate each other's name tag
except for the person being targeted.</i>

1043
00:59:46,471 --> 00:59:51,210
<i>You can only eliminate the name tag of
the person that is being targeted.</i>

1044
00:59:51,210 --> 00:59:52,508
Really?

1045
00:59:52,665 --> 00:59:56,972
<i>If the target survives and remains alive
without having their name tag eliminated...</i>

1046
00:59:56,972 --> 01:00:00,919
<i>then the target must find the hidden
whistle and blow on it.</i>

1047
01:00:00,920 --> 01:00:02,442
A hidden whistle?

1048
01:00:02,638 --> 01:00:05,466
- What happens when we blow it?
- When you blow on the whistle...

1049
01:00:06,397 --> 01:00:09,725
Then the new target will become
the next person on the list.

1050
01:00:09,725 --> 01:00:14,407
<i>And the current target will
become the last person on the target list.</i>

1051
01:00:15,892 --> 01:00:18,309
So we're going to have to find the whistle
if we don't want to be eliminated?

1052
01:00:18,310 --> 01:00:20,543
I just need to find the whistle.

1053
01:00:20,579 --> 01:00:23,670
I can't even blow the whistle
unless I'm the current target?

1054
01:00:24,305 --> 01:00:30,123
<i>Then we will now start the
target name tag elimination race.</i>

1055
01:00:30,752 --> 01:00:32,749
<i>The first target is...</i>

1056
01:00:33,730 --> 01:00:36,044
- I doubt I'm the first target.
- Your first target is...

1057
01:00:36,740 --> 01:00:40,371
- I will announce your first target.
- I bet everything I have that it's Jong Kook.

1058
01:00:40,678 --> 01:00:42,754
- Kim Jong Kook.
- Your first target is...

1059
01:00:43,265 --> 01:00:45,009
<i>With a total of...</i>

1060
01:00:45,010 --> 01:00:46,471
<i>11 votes...</i>

1061
01:00:46,472 --> 01:00:48,635
I'm sure of who this is going to be.

1062
01:00:48,815 --> 01:00:50,533
That sure is a lot of votes.

1063
01:00:50,534 --> 01:00:52,919
- Kim Jong Kook.
- I'm either the first or the second.

1064
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:54,845
- Your first target...
- First or the second.

1065
01:00:55,493 --> 01:00:57,511
<i>With a total of 11 votes...</i>

1066
01:00:57,512 --> 01:01:01,847
[Who's the first target
with a total of 11 votes?]

1067
01:01:01,848 --> 01:01:03,196
<i>Is Lee Kwang Soo.</i>

1068
01:01:03,197 --> 01:01:04,949
<i>Your first target is Lee Kwang Soo.</i>

1069
01:01:04,950 --> 01:01:06,733
[First target with a total of 11 votes-
Traitorous Giraffe.]

1070
01:01:06,734 --> 01:01:08,285
They're all way too much.

1071
01:01:09,239 --> 01:01:12,153
They really are too much.
Come back here and hide.

1072
01:01:13,289 --> 01:01:14,793
<i>Lee Kwang Soo.</i>

1073
01:01:14,794 --> 01:01:17,175
[First target is Kwang Soo!
It's not Jong Kook!]

1074
01:01:18,452 --> 01:01:19,768
It's Kwang Soo?

1075
01:01:21,606 --> 01:01:23,469
<i>Is Lee Kwang Soo.</i>

1076
01:01:24,247 --> 01:01:25,884
<i>Lee Kwang Soo.</i>

1077
01:01:26,899 --> 01:01:29,027
- Is Lee Kwang Soo.
- They're so mean.

1078
01:01:29,028 --> 01:01:33,515
<i>Eliminate your target's name tag before
he finds and blows on the blue whistle.</i>

1079
01:01:34,033 --> 01:01:38,913
<i>Eliminate his name tag before
Lee Kwang Soo finds and blows the whistle.</i>

1080
01:01:38,914 --> 01:01:41,242
Everyone must really dislike Kwang Soo.

1081
01:01:41,436 --> 01:01:44,495
[The Giraffe is hiding inside this box.]

1082
01:01:44,496 --> 01:01:47,020
What the heck?
How could I have 11 votes?

1083
01:01:48,199 --> 01:01:50,167
I thought that I saw the whistle.

1084
01:01:51,405 --> 01:01:53,150
You may now start.

1085
01:01:53,151 --> 01:01:55,404
[First target race is about to start.]

1086
01:01:55,787 --> 01:01:57,055
Two.

1087
01:01:57,056 --> 01:01:59,842
<i>One.
Start!</i>

1088
01:01:59,843 --> 01:02:01,104
[First target chase- Start.]

1089
01:02:01,492 --> 01:02:04,114
[Catch your first target, Kwang Soo!]

1090
01:02:04,115 --> 01:02:05,735
- Kwang Soo!
- That's unbelievable.

1091
01:02:05,736 --> 01:02:08,230
- Lee Kwang Soo, where are you?
- Kwang Soo!

1092
01:02:08,231 --> 01:02:10,704
- Wow, unbelievable. I'm so shocked.
- Where's Kwang Soo?

1093
01:02:10,705 --> 01:02:12,486
- I really thought it would be Jong Kook.
- Me too.

1094
01:02:12,487 --> 01:02:15,442
- I think Kwang Soo's downstairs.
- Lee Kwang Soo.

1095
01:02:15,443 --> 01:02:18,428
- Hey, where's Kwang Soo?
- Lee Kwang Soo, don't you dare move!

1096
01:02:19,732 --> 01:02:21,966
Wow, this place is so small that
there's not even a place for him to hide.

1097
01:02:22,420 --> 01:02:24,712
I feel so bad for Kwang Soo.
The poor thing.

1098
01:02:25,374 --> 01:02:27,720
We promised each other that we'd
both last until the very end.

1099
01:02:29,193 --> 01:02:31,422
I'm pretty sure that I'm next.

1100
01:02:31,976 --> 01:02:34,339
I need to find it.
I just need to survive once.

1101
01:02:34,340 --> 01:02:36,057
I need to survive once.
Come on, Jong Kook.

1102
01:02:39,568 --> 01:02:41,283
Why is it me?

1103
01:02:44,071 --> 01:02:45,876
Come in here.
Come in.

1104
01:02:51,807 --> 01:02:55,312
[I'm sure there are those of you
who've already discovered where it is...]

1105
01:02:55,313 --> 01:02:59,930
[But the blue whistle that Kwang Soo needs
to blow is right in front of his eyes.]

1106
01:03:00,398 --> 01:03:03,954
[The truth that Giraffe is
certainly unaware of...]

1107
01:03:10,917 --> 01:03:12,953
[Ji Hyo?]

1108
01:03:14,307 --> 01:03:16,409
[I'm going to go crazy...]

1109
01:03:17,737 --> 01:03:20,056
[Kwang Soo's right there.]

1110
01:03:34,269 --> 01:03:36,866
[Kwang Soo is right here.]

1111
01:03:44,294 --> 01:03:45,707
Lee Kwang Soo!

1112
01:03:45,708 --> 01:03:46,835
[Ji Hyo discovers first target, Kwang Soo.]

1113
01:03:46,836 --> 01:03:49,199
Jong Kook!
Kwang Soo's right here!

1114
01:03:50,278 --> 01:03:53,529
[Giraffe takes Ji Hyo as his hostage
out of sheer desperation.]

1115
01:03:53,530 --> 01:03:54,919
In here!

1116
01:03:54,920 --> 01:03:56,862
In here!
He's in here!

1117
01:03:57,130 --> 01:03:59,581
[Ah... the whistle is right here.]

1118
01:04:00,840 --> 01:04:03,521
[Giraffe is on the verge of exploding
from having felt betrayed.]

1119
01:04:03,522 --> 01:04:05,678
It really wasn't me.
I really didn't vote for you.

1120
01:04:05,679 --> 01:04:07,613
- Jae Suk, how could you do this to me?
- Kwang Soo...

1121
01:04:07,614 --> 01:04:09,914
- It really wasn't me.
- We've been together all day!

1122
01:04:09,915 --> 01:04:12,872
[We were teamed up together all day!]

1123
01:04:12,873 --> 01:04:15,111
- We can't write each other's name down.
- Of course not.

1124
01:04:15,112 --> 01:04:20,033
[They've agreed not to write
each other's names down.]

1125
01:04:20,034 --> 01:04:23,317
[I trusted what you guys told me...]

1126
01:04:24,521 --> 01:04:27,739
We can't write each other's names down just
because we win ourselves a ballot, okay?

1127
01:04:27,962 --> 01:04:32,520
[I cared for you and even did everything
I could to help you because we were a team.]

1128
01:04:32,521 --> 01:04:35,759
[We promised each other that the three
of us would stay together to the end...]

1129
01:04:36,619 --> 01:04:39,290
- We were together all day today!
- Let Ji Hyo go.

1130
01:04:39,291 --> 01:04:41,415
- It wasn't me, Kwang Soo.
- Don't come any closer!

1131
01:04:42,163 --> 01:04:44,349
- We were shocked ourselves.
- Kwang Soo.

1132
01:04:44,350 --> 01:04:46,029
- There's nothing that can be done about this.
- How can you do this to me?

1133
01:04:46,030 --> 01:04:48,096
- What? 11 votes?
- I was shocked too.

1134
01:04:48,097 --> 01:04:50,803
- Hey, it wasn't me. I didn't do it.
- You had 11 votes?

1135
01:04:50,804 --> 01:04:52,598
[At the very least, everyone had to have
voted for Kwang Soo at least once.]

1136
01:04:53,034 --> 01:04:55,388
If it's 11 votes, it means that all of you
must've voted for me at least once!

1137
01:04:55,389 --> 01:04:58,021
[Monday boyfriend, Gary, steps in
to rescue Ji Hyo.]

1138
01:04:58,022 --> 01:04:59,425
Kwang Soo.

1139
01:04:59,426 --> 01:05:01,658
[Everyone comes to join in on
this tragic scene one by one.]

1140
01:05:01,659 --> 01:05:04,526
- Jae Suk, no!
- Come on, Kwang Soo.

1141
01:05:05,374 --> 01:05:07,022
I'm going to get my revenge!

1142
01:05:07,023 --> 01:05:09,099
I'm going to wreak havoc next week!

1143
01:05:09,100 --> 01:05:11,128
- You've all been warned!
- I'm sorry.

1144
01:05:11,129 --> 01:05:13,238
[First target, Lee Kwang Soo- Out!]

1145
01:05:13,706 --> 01:05:17,584
[In a traitor's term... He was bulldozed.]

1146
01:05:17,585 --> 01:05:19,676
You need to be a better person
all year around.

1147
01:05:19,677 --> 01:05:22,115
I was shocked too
when I heard the announcement.

1148
01:05:22,116 --> 01:05:25,404
- I didn't write your name down.
- At least three of you wrote my down twice.

1149
01:05:25,968 --> 01:05:28,468
I'm going to watch this episode when it airs
to see which one of you wrote me down.

1150
01:05:28,468 --> 01:05:30,225
- Jae Suk!
- I can't believe he got 11 votes.

1151
01:05:30,709 --> 01:05:36,356
[Only Kwang Soo's blue whistle remains
by its lonesome...]

1152
01:05:36,631 --> 01:05:38,377
Let's see who's laughing next week!

1153
01:05:38,949 --> 01:05:40,769
What?
I'm back in here?

1154
01:05:44,275 --> 01:05:46,687
The cameras aren't even finished
being setup yet.

1155
01:05:48,124 --> 01:05:51,886
[Sorry, we didn't think you'd be
back in here so quickly.]

1156
01:05:52,274 --> 01:05:55,267
- I thought it would be Jong Kook.
- We all wanted to get rid of the traitor.

1157
01:05:55,268 --> 01:05:57,461
- I thought it would be Jong Kook too.
- Then I guess Jong Kook is up next.

1158
01:05:57,461 --> 01:06:00,318
[Then the next target surely is...]

1159
01:06:00,319 --> 01:06:01,945
- He knows himself.
- Jong Kook didn't show up on purpose.

1160
01:06:01,946 --> 01:06:03,511
Let's go find Jong Kook.

1161
01:06:03,512 --> 01:06:06,101
Let's split up into two groups,
so we can work from up and downstairs.

1162
01:06:07,389 --> 01:06:11,106
<i>Lee Kwang Soo, out.
Lee Kwang Soo, out.</i>

1163
01:06:13,159 --> 01:06:14,921
<i>Your next target is...</i>

1164
01:06:15,271 --> 01:06:17,553
<i>with a total of 10 votes...</i>

1165
01:06:17,554 --> 01:06:20,187
- With a total of 10 votes.
- 10 votes? That's only one vote difference.

1166
01:06:20,188 --> 01:06:21,824
[Exactly one vote difference from
Kwang Soo's total votes.]

1167
01:06:23,191 --> 01:06:25,445
[Second target with a total of 10 votes.]

1168
01:06:25,446 --> 01:06:27,157
Your next target is Kim Jong Kook.

1169
01:06:27,158 --> 01:06:30,727
[Target race's second target-
Kim Jong Kook with ten votes.]

1170
01:06:35,307 --> 01:06:39,861
<i>Before Kim Jong Kook finds
his purple whistle...</i>

1171
01:06:39,862 --> 01:06:41,930
<i>you must eliminate his name tag.</i>

1172
01:06:43,158 --> 01:06:45,151
If we don't get him now, then we're all dead.

1173
01:06:45,152 --> 01:06:47,685
If we don't get him now,
then Kim Jong Kook will surely win.

1174
01:06:48,152 --> 01:06:49,542
I wonder if he's inside.

1175
01:06:49,543 --> 01:06:52,175
[Big-nose and Ro-Ro are searching
the outside parameters.]

1176
01:06:52,176 --> 01:06:55,244
- Would you go on your own if it was you?
- Is he hanging off the ledge somewhere?

1177
01:06:55,245 --> 01:06:57,137
He's not hanging off the ledge
somewhere, is he?

1178
01:06:57,138 --> 01:06:58,161
That's what I was thinking.

1179
01:06:58,162 --> 01:07:00,213
I wouldn't put it past him.

1180
01:07:00,348 --> 01:07:04,029
[Jong Kook is desperately searching
everywhere for his purple whistle.]

1181
01:07:08,519 --> 01:07:10,058
Where's my whistle?

1182
01:07:10,812 --> 01:07:12,245
My whistle.

1183
01:07:12,246 --> 01:07:17,851
[Will he be able to find his whistle
to remain alive to the very end?]

1184
01:07:26,907 --> 01:07:31,325
[The purple whistle!]

1185
01:07:31,623 --> 01:07:34,230
[It wouldn't even do Jae Suk any good
to blow on that whistle now.]

1186
01:07:34,231 --> 01:07:35,773
I can just leave it here, right?

1187
01:07:37,782 --> 01:07:40,433
[Leaving it so that it can't be found.]

1188
01:07:43,249 --> 01:07:45,769
[Leaving it alone and buried
so that it can't be found.]

1189
01:07:46,503 --> 01:07:49,381
[So detailed about he how leaves it...]

1190
01:07:51,822 --> 01:07:55,307
[Jong Kook...
I never touched your whistle.]

1191
01:07:58,433 --> 01:07:59,638
Hey there.

1192
01:07:59,639 --> 01:08:01,211
What have I done that's so wrong?

1193
01:08:01,212 --> 01:08:03,485
- Look, I was shocked about it myself.
- 11 votes?

1194
01:08:04,251 --> 01:08:06,557
I can't tell you how shocked I was
when I heard that announcement myself.

1195
01:08:06,558 --> 01:08:09,493
- Getting 11 votes means...
- I will do whatever I can to free you.

1196
01:08:09,494 --> 01:08:10,983
How?
You know of a way?

1197
01:08:10,984 --> 01:08:14,553
Don't worry.
Just wait... just wait a bit longer.

1198
01:08:14,554 --> 01:08:16,607
- I'll get you out of there.
- The cameras aren't even setup in here yet.

1199
01:08:16,608 --> 01:08:18,334
- It's totally bare in here.
- Okay.

1200
01:08:18,335 --> 01:08:20,355
- Don't worry about it.
- What do you mean, don't worry?

1201
01:08:20,685 --> 01:08:22,925
No one's even in here to film me, Jae Suk.

1202
01:08:23,045 --> 01:08:24,474
Jae Suk.

1203
01:08:24,753 --> 01:08:26,383
I'm ruined.
I'm totally ruined.

1204
01:08:26,384 --> 01:08:29,435
[Jong Kook is still searching
for his purple whistle.]

1205
01:08:32,684 --> 01:08:36,271
Even with the building so small...
it's not so easy to find him.

1206
01:08:38,916 --> 01:08:40,566
I'm positive that he's outside.

1207
01:08:41,035 --> 01:08:43,276
But he doesn't even have
his coat on.

1208
01:08:48,775 --> 01:08:50,270
- Is he not there?
- I don't see him.

1209
01:08:51,009 --> 01:08:52,322
Jong Kook.

1210
01:08:52,818 --> 01:08:55,448
[Okay... I need to get out of here
if I want to survive...]

1211
01:09:01,875 --> 01:09:03,962
[This sound means that the second target,
Kim Jong Kook has been discovered!]

1212
01:09:03,963 --> 01:09:05,844
- He's right here!
- Here!

1213
01:09:05,845 --> 01:09:07,684
Kim Jong Kook is here!

1214
01:09:10,053 --> 01:09:12,775
Where?

1215
01:09:13,684 --> 01:09:15,106
Where did he go?

1216
01:09:19,195 --> 01:09:21,670
[Second target Jong Kook escapes
to inside of the building.]

1217
01:09:21,671 --> 01:09:24,063
[Discovered as soon as he steps inside.]

1218
01:09:25,269 --> 01:09:27,875
[A dead end of all places!]

1219
01:09:27,876 --> 01:09:32,271
[Surrounded from all sides...
and the Ace jumps to grab him!]

1220
01:09:34,804 --> 01:09:36,822
[Hee Soon jumping in on the mix to
join in out of his excitement.]

1221
01:09:36,823 --> 01:09:38,522
Let me be the one to eliminate you.

1222
01:09:40,695 --> 01:09:43,124
[Second target, Kim Jong Kook- Out!]

1223
01:09:43,125 --> 01:09:44,318
Hee Soon.

1224
01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:47,147
[You said not to be disappointed by this...]

1225
01:09:47,148 --> 01:09:49,787
[So this is what it feels like.]

1226
01:09:52,814 --> 01:09:56,720
<i>Kim Jong Kook, out.
Kim Jong Kook, out.</i>

1227
01:09:59,124 --> 01:10:01,148
[I'm in trouble if I'm the next target!]

1228
01:10:01,149 --> 01:10:03,244
I'm sure it won't be me.
It won't be me.

1229
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:05,808
- I don't think it'll be me either.
- Your next target is...

1230
01:10:08,112 --> 01:10:10,629
<i>Your next target is... Gary.</i>

1231
01:10:11,350 --> 01:10:12,452
Me?

1232
01:10:12,453 --> 01:10:13,714
<i>Gary.</i>

1233
01:10:13,981 --> 01:10:16,219
[Third target- Gary.]

1234
01:10:16,220 --> 01:10:20,510
- It's me?
- Before Gary finds the yellow whistle...

1235
01:10:20,511 --> 01:10:23,179
<i>You must eliminate his name tag.</i>

1236
01:10:24,582 --> 01:10:26,344
It's in here, Gary!

1237
01:10:26,345 --> 01:10:29,625
It's right in front of the jail cell!

1238
01:10:29,626 --> 01:10:32,065
<i>Your next target is, Gary.</i>

1239
01:10:32,066 --> 01:10:34,444
[Third target- Random Mr. Capable.
Capture Gary!]

1240
01:10:35,167 --> 01:10:37,265
- It's Gary!
- Where is he?

1241
01:10:37,739 --> 01:10:44,210
<i>Before Gary finds the yellow whistle,
you must eliminate his name tag.</i>

1242
01:10:44,211 --> 01:10:45,340
[Gary must find his yellow whistle
for him to remain alive.]

1243
01:10:45,341 --> 01:10:47,472
- Did he go up the stairs?
- Gary!

1244
01:10:47,473 --> 01:10:48,660
Where did Gary go?

1245
01:10:51,227 --> 01:10:54,011
[Fleeing all the way to the top floor.]

1246
01:10:58,676 --> 01:11:00,838
<i>Is this the end of the hallway?
Wait!</i>

1247
01:11:00,839 --> 01:11:02,663
[I've got you!]

1248
01:11:02,664 --> 01:11:04,840
<i>Is this the end of the hallway?
Wait!</i>

1249
01:11:04,841 --> 01:11:06,893
[We're about to meet face to face!]

1250
01:11:08,597 --> 01:11:09,992
What do I do now?

1251
01:11:10,290 --> 01:11:12,328
[Gong Yoo makes a beeline for Gary!]

1252
01:11:13,483 --> 01:11:16,095
[Gary is like a rat caught in
a mousetrap.]

1253
01:11:16,096 --> 01:11:18,105
- Hurry!
- Why is it me?

1254
01:11:18,106 --> 01:11:21,661
- This makes no sense!
- You're the next target.

1255
01:11:21,662 --> 01:11:23,693
[Random Mr. Capable landed himself
in third place with five votes.]

1256
01:11:23,694 --> 01:11:26,364
- I worked so hard to stay alive!
- Sorry, Gary.

1257
01:11:26,365 --> 01:11:27,449
[Third target, Gary- out!]

1258
01:11:28,076 --> 01:11:30,094
How did you get so many votes?

1259
01:11:30,095 --> 01:11:32,688
[With the total of being second strongest,
many seemed to have feared Gary.]

1260
01:11:32,943 --> 01:11:35,248
<i>Gary, out.</i>

1261
01:11:41,027 --> 01:11:44,592
[Could the next target be... me?]

1262
01:11:47,399 --> 01:11:49,419
[I can't fit in here...]

1263
01:11:50,508 --> 01:11:52,391
I wonder who's next after Kang Gary?

1264
01:11:52,392 --> 01:11:54,179
[Who could the fourth target be?]

1265
01:11:54,180 --> 01:11:56,263
This is really exciting.

1266
01:11:56,264 --> 01:11:58,015
It's a very exciting race today.

1267
01:11:58,482 --> 01:12:00,379
I can't believe how good it feels
not to be the target.

1268
01:12:01,503 --> 01:12:03,491
<i>Your next target is...</i>

1269
01:12:04,306 --> 01:12:06,565
<i>- Your next target is...
- Ha Ha.</i>

1270
01:12:07,665 --> 01:12:09,610
<i>Your next target is...</i>

1271
01:12:10,176 --> 01:12:11,849
[Who could be the fourth target?]

1272
01:12:11,850 --> 01:12:13,331
<i>Yoo Jae Suk.</i>

1273
01:12:15,275 --> 01:12:18,217
[Fourth target is Yoo Jae Suk,
with a total of four votes.]

1274
01:12:19,109 --> 01:12:22,168
[Everyone alike panics whenever
they're announced to be the next target.]

1275
01:12:22,169 --> 01:12:26,871
<i>Before Yoo Jae Suk finds a black whistle,
you must eliminate his name tag.</i>

1276
01:12:27,629 --> 01:12:29,001
[Target- Yoo Jae Suk.]

1277
01:12:29,002 --> 01:12:31,154
[Serves him right!]

1278
01:12:31,155 --> 01:12:33,403
- Wow! Let's go get him!
- It's Jae Suk!

1279
01:12:33,404 --> 01:12:35,351
- It's Jae Suk!
- That's hilarious.

1280
01:12:35,352 --> 01:12:42,073
<i>Before Yoo Jae Suk finds a black whistle,
you must eliminate his name tag.</i>

1281
01:12:42,756 --> 01:12:45,171
[Oh! He's right in front of me!]

1282
01:12:45,172 --> 01:12:46,477
Next target is Yoo Jae Suk.

1283
01:12:46,478 --> 01:12:49,619
[Being chased after by Ji Hyo
as soon as the race gets started.]

1284
01:12:49,620 --> 01:12:54,445
<i>Before Yoo Jae Suk finds a black whistle,
you must eliminate his name tag.</i>

1285
01:12:55,920 --> 01:12:59,377
[Ji Hyo having discovered both Kwang Soo
and Jae Suk today on her own!]

1286
01:13:08,654 --> 01:13:12,041
I have a bad feeling that I might be next,
so I'm too nervous to even eliminate anyone.

1287
01:13:12,496 --> 01:13:13,841
Let me think who we've had so far.

1288
01:13:14,777 --> 01:13:19,378
Kwang Soo, Kim Jong Kook, Gary, Yoo Jae Suk.

1289
01:13:20,503 --> 01:13:22,106
Which means that the next target
will either be me or Ha Ha.

1290
01:13:27,784 --> 01:13:30,647
[Jae Suk's voice can be heard
from nearby!]

1291
01:13:36,167 --> 01:13:38,267
[His black whistle is right here!]

1292
01:13:38,944 --> 01:13:41,662
[To get caught in this room of all places!]

1293
01:13:43,221 --> 01:13:46,771
[Fourth target, Yoo Jae Suk- Out!]

1294
01:13:46,772 --> 01:13:48,707
Which floor was the whistle on?

1295
01:13:50,153 --> 01:13:51,840
[What do you mean, which floor...]

1296
01:13:51,841 --> 01:13:55,895
[It's right here.]

1297
01:13:55,896 --> 01:13:58,202
So this is what it feels like
to eliminate someone's name tag?

1298
01:13:58,877 --> 01:14:00,272
That felt really good.

1299
01:14:01,242 --> 01:14:04,343
The truth is...
I gave Jae Suk one of my votes.

1300
01:14:13,941 --> 01:14:16,357
Where did Gong Yoo spring out of?

1301
01:14:16,358 --> 01:14:18,752
There's not even any place to run to.

1302
01:14:20,553 --> 01:14:23,317
Wait, a minute though.
How did I end up with so many votes?

1303
01:14:23,318 --> 01:14:25,221
[Who were the four people
that voted for me?]

1304
01:14:25,736 --> 01:14:29,156
[Who are you grumbling about injustice
in front of right now?]

1305
01:14:29,468 --> 01:14:31,736
- What? You didn't vote for me?
- But wait a minute...

1306
01:14:31,737 --> 01:14:34,289
How did I end up with so many votes
when everyone denied voting for me?

1307
01:14:34,290 --> 01:14:36,227
People just must not like you.

1308
01:14:36,528 --> 01:14:39,113
[Not because he's a strong opponent,
but because they don't like him?]

1309
01:14:39,114 --> 01:14:40,801
It's possible for people to not like you
because you've won so may races.

1310
01:14:40,802 --> 01:14:44,170
- That's not the factor in this right now.
- But how was I the third target?

1311
01:14:44,365 --> 01:14:48,644
- How did you end up with 11 votes?
- It's because you're a formidable opponent.

1312
01:14:48,645 --> 01:14:50,828
My 11 votes should end up in
the Guinness Book of World Records.

1313
01:14:50,829 --> 01:14:53,945
- There are a lot of others to vote for.
- Why didn't any of you vote for Gong Yoo?

1314
01:14:53,946 --> 01:14:56,219
I saw your purple whistle.

1315
01:14:56,437 --> 01:14:58,728
That's what I thought.
Why did you take it?

1316
01:14:58,728 --> 01:14:59,829
- You saw it?
- Yeah.

1317
01:14:59,864 --> 01:15:02,053
- You should've just left it alone.
- I didn't steal it, and I did leave it alone.

1318
01:15:02,054 --> 01:15:03,568
- Are you sure?
- I didn't even touch it.

1319
01:15:03,870 --> 01:15:06,395
All I did was close the lid to
where the whistle was.

1320
01:15:09,262 --> 01:15:11,719
- I can understand how you could do that.
- Why did you do that?

1321
01:15:11,838 --> 01:15:13,705
<i>Your next target is...</i>

1322
01:15:13,933 --> 01:15:16,117
- I bet it's Ha Ha.
- Your next target is...

1323
01:15:16,118 --> 01:15:19,082
[Suk Jin, Hee Soon, Gong Yoo, Ha Ha, Ji Hyo-
Who could be the next target?]

1324
01:15:19,083 --> 01:15:20,405
I have a feeling that it's me.

1325
01:15:21,389 --> 01:15:23,398
<i>Your next target is...</i>

1326
01:15:23,399 --> 01:15:25,580
[Who could be the fifth target?]

1327
01:15:25,581 --> 01:15:28,615
<i>Gong Yoo.</i>

1328
01:15:28,616 --> 01:15:30,546
<i>And...</i>

1329
01:15:31,193 --> 01:15:34,055
- Gong Yoo, and...
- He should've been a target sooner.

1330
01:15:34,056 --> 01:15:37,153
- Ha Ha.
- They're both targets?

1331
01:15:37,697 --> 01:15:41,068
[Fifth targets are Gong Yoo and Ha Ha.]

1332
01:15:41,069 --> 01:15:47,056
<i>Before Gong Yoo and Ha Ha find
the red whistle...</i>

1333
01:15:47,057 --> 01:15:49,731
<i>you must eliminate the name tags
off of your targets.</i>

1334
01:15:50,932 --> 01:15:52,760
Look at everyone down there.

1335
01:15:55,075 --> 01:15:59,733
[Red whistle...
I have to find it no matter what!]

1336
01:16:02,117 --> 01:16:06,967
[Ji Hyo, who's discovered everyone today...
starts her search for the new targets.]

1337
01:16:06,968 --> 01:16:08,369
I have to find the red whistle first
in order to get them.

1338
01:16:09,350 --> 01:16:11,770
[Who should I find first to
make it easier for myself?]

1339
01:16:15,290 --> 01:16:16,936
[Oh?]

1340
01:16:16,937 --> 01:16:19,592
[Discovers Gong Yoo!]

1341
01:16:19,593 --> 01:16:21,884
[Discovers fifth target Gong Yoo!]

1342
01:16:21,885 --> 01:16:23,900
Why isn't anyone around?
Hee Soon!

1343
01:16:24,261 --> 01:16:25,469
Gong Yoo!

1344
01:16:25,470 --> 01:16:28,336
Hee Soon!
Gong Yoo's right there!

1345
01:16:28,337 --> 01:16:29,488
[Hee Soon runs to help her.]

1346
01:16:29,523 --> 01:16:31,553
Where is everyone?
Hee Soon!

1347
01:16:34,140 --> 01:16:35,941
Fourth floor!

1348
01:16:41,784 --> 01:16:44,156
[Gong Yoo makes a break for it
to get away from Ji Hyo's chase!]

1349
01:16:45,026 --> 01:16:48,287
[Fifth target, Gong Yoo-
Everyone's new focused target!]

1350
01:16:48,909 --> 01:16:52,011
[How is he going to get himself
out of this danger?]

1351
01:16:56,275 --> 01:16:57,633
I see someone going down.

1352
01:16:58,297 --> 01:17:01,321
[Hee Soon is continuing his chase
after Gong Yoo.]

1353
01:17:01,894 --> 01:17:04,031
[Everyone's watching...]

1354
01:17:04,032 --> 01:17:06,552
[Try your best and hide...]

1355
01:17:14,589 --> 01:17:21,403
[Hee Soon is approaching the emergency
stairway that Gong Yoo is hiding in.]

1356
01:17:24,097 --> 01:17:26,734
[Wait, that sound means?]

1357
01:17:26,735 --> 01:17:28,419
Hey, someone blew the whistle.

1358
01:17:29,285 --> 01:17:31,816
[This is the unmistakable sound of
a whistle being blown.]

1359
01:17:32,493 --> 01:17:33,999
Who blew the whistle?

1360
01:17:35,495 --> 01:17:37,137
Did he blow the whistle?

1361
01:17:37,138 --> 01:17:39,699
[That means...]

1362
01:17:41,304 --> 01:17:43,726
[Ha Ha, having been on the run...]

1363
01:17:45,561 --> 01:17:47,393
[Sees the red whistle on the ground!]

1364
01:17:53,359 --> 01:17:56,098
[Discovers the whistle by total luck!]

1365
01:17:58,699 --> 01:18:01,703
[Blowing this whistle puts Ha Ha and Gong Yoo
at the end of the target line!]

1366
01:18:08,382 --> 01:18:11,147
[The whistle blow to sound
their freedom.]

1367
01:18:13,943 --> 01:18:16,726
<i>Ha Ha and Gong Yoo are saved.</i>

1368
01:18:18,149 --> 01:18:20,844
<i>Ha Ha and Gong Yoo are saved.</i>

1369
01:18:21,526 --> 01:18:24,099
<i>Ha Ha and Gong Yoo are saved.</i>

1370
01:18:24,100 --> 01:18:32,008
[Whistle is successfully blown-
Gong Yoo and Ha Ha to the end of the line.]

1371
01:18:33,846 --> 01:18:40,149
<i>Ha Ha and Gong Yoo are now moved to
the back of the target line.</i>

1372
01:18:44,671 --> 01:18:46,660
I found it!

1373
01:18:47,277 --> 01:18:48,937
Gong Yoo!

1374
01:18:48,938 --> 01:18:50,835
You owe me!

1375
01:18:54,422 --> 01:19:00,245
<i>Ha Ha will move to the very back of the line
for having been the one to find the whistle.</i>

1376
01:19:00,863 --> 01:19:04,697
<i>And Gong Yoo is now second to last
in the target line.</i>

1377
01:19:04,698 --> 01:19:05,874
That was nice.

1378
01:19:06,330 --> 01:19:07,960
Park Hee Soon!

1379
01:19:09,533 --> 01:19:11,234
It's me, Gong Yoo!

1380
01:19:12,848 --> 01:19:15,859
[Now desperate Hee Soon quickly
escapes as far away as he can.]

1381
01:19:18,168 --> 01:19:20,074
[Come in.]

1382
01:19:22,185 --> 01:19:25,534
I will announce your next target.

1383
01:19:25,535 --> 01:19:29,829
[Which out of the three is the next target?]

1384
01:19:29,830 --> 01:19:31,529
<i>Your next target is...</i>

1385
01:19:32,149 --> 01:19:33,635
<i>Your next target is...</i>

1386
01:19:33,636 --> 01:19:35,006
It's probably me.

1387
01:19:36,468 --> 01:19:41,364
- Ji Suk Jin, Park Hee Soon...
- It's not me?

1388
01:19:41,365 --> 01:19:43,637
- Ugh, it's the both of us.
- Both are your new targets.

1389
01:19:44,020 --> 01:19:47,286
[Suk Jin and Hee Soon both
are the new targets.]

1390
01:19:49,211 --> 01:19:53,122
<i>Suk Jin and Hee Soon both
are the new targets.</i>

1391
01:19:53,999 --> 01:19:59,232
<i>Before Suk Jin and Hee Soon
find the green whistle...</i>

1392
01:19:59,654 --> 01:20:01,461
<i>you must eliminate both of
their name tags.</i>

1393
01:20:01,462 --> 01:20:05,393
<i>Before Suk Jin and Hee Soon
find the green whistle</i>

1394
01:20:05,394 --> 01:20:07,424
<i>you must eliminate both of
their name tags.</i>

1395
01:20:08,522 --> 01:20:12,845
[Will they be able to create a miracle
just like Ha Ha did?]

1396
01:20:16,259 --> 01:20:18,628
More than anything else,
I'd think it would really hurt your hands.

1397
01:20:18,629 --> 01:20:20,111
Are you okay?

1398
01:20:20,967 --> 01:20:22,519
- Congratulations, Gong Yoo.
- Congratulations.

1399
01:20:22,520 --> 01:20:24,474
You could win the race.

1400
01:20:24,681 --> 01:20:26,620
Ha Ha blowing the whistle
was a huge help.

1401
01:20:26,621 --> 01:20:27,978
[Having survived thanks to
his friend, Ha Ha.]

1402
01:20:27,979 --> 01:20:30,580
If Gong Yoo were to get ousted,
he needed to have been ousted now.

1403
01:20:30,581 --> 01:20:32,106
- I know.
- It'll be difficult to oust him now.

1404
01:20:32,107 --> 01:20:33,789
I'm starting to feel the greed
to win now.

1405
01:20:34,287 --> 01:20:37,638
[Now's about the time for anyone to get
greedy about winning.]

1406
01:20:37,639 --> 01:20:39,394
The desire to win now...

1407
01:20:39,777 --> 01:20:41,609
[So envious...]

1408
01:20:41,868 --> 01:20:43,714
<i>You can't get out this way, right?</i>

1409
01:20:45,800 --> 01:20:48,018
I found the whistle.
I found the whistle.

1410
01:20:49,307 --> 01:20:50,940
I found the whistle.

1411
01:20:50,941 --> 01:20:52,967
[The whistle that Suk Jin and
Hee Soon needs!]

1412
01:20:54,868 --> 01:20:56,398
[In that case...]

1413
01:20:56,399 --> 01:20:59,791
[Should I hide to attack them
right here?]

1414
01:21:01,243 --> 01:21:04,159
Hee Soon. Hee Soon will be
good at something like this.

1415
01:21:04,160 --> 01:21:06,022
Even though he may not be good at
things that require strength...

1416
01:21:06,023 --> 01:21:09,030
I bet he'd be good at hiding since
he's such a quiet person.

1417
01:21:13,071 --> 01:21:17,347
[Oh? Why is this door left open?]

1418
01:21:19,844 --> 01:21:21,260
No way.

1419
01:21:34,512 --> 01:21:35,900
No way.

1420
01:21:48,424 --> 01:21:49,834
<i>Hee Soon.</i>

1421
01:21:50,863 --> 01:21:52,392
It's all over now.

1422
01:21:56,938 --> 01:21:59,452
He's not here.

1423
01:22:00,396 --> 01:22:04,567
I think he's found himself a good place.
No one knows of this place right now.

1424
01:22:05,318 --> 01:22:07,446
[Hee Soon is behind that
door right now!]

1425
01:22:08,493 --> 01:22:09,752
<i>This space feels like...</i>

1426
01:22:09,753 --> 01:22:15,880
<i>It feels like an action sequence from a movie
that I just shot needs to happen here.</i>

1427
01:22:16,413 --> 01:22:18,272
<i>Even the lighting is a bit
darker in here.</i>

1428
01:22:19,960 --> 01:22:25,191
I eliminate about 10 to 15 bad guys
in a scene that looks like this place.

1429
01:22:26,870 --> 01:22:29,974
[Just leaves after
chattering on the whole time.]

1430
01:22:31,540 --> 01:22:33,024
<i>In an underground chamber.</i>

1431
01:22:34,396 --> 01:22:35,880
<i>Where could he be?</i>

1432
01:22:36,865 --> 01:22:40,551
[He's leaving...]

1433
01:22:46,586 --> 01:22:50,746
So only one person needs to blow the
whistle for both of us to survive?

1434
01:22:52,782 --> 01:22:55,436
[You're searching for it, right, Suk Jin?]

1435
01:22:56,255 --> 01:22:58,963
[You're searching for it, right, Hee Soon?]

1436
01:22:59,920 --> 01:23:02,666
- I searched the basement, and no one's there.
- This is driving me crazy.

1437
01:23:02,667 --> 01:23:05,115
- Ji Hyo!
- Hee Soon's good at things like this.

1438
01:23:05,116 --> 01:23:07,414
- He's good at hiding
- Yeah, he's a very quiet person.

1439
01:23:07,762 --> 01:23:10,764
He's a very quiet person.
Oh, and where do you want to meet?

1440
01:23:10,765 --> 01:23:12,262
- For what?
- You owe me a night out.

1441
01:23:13,417 --> 01:23:15,881
First... since we're the two last targets...

1442
01:23:15,882 --> 01:23:17,935
- Let's see what happens at the end.
- Okay, fine.

1443
01:23:17,936 --> 01:23:20,987
- Anyways, don't forget what I did.
- What you did was huge.

1444
01:23:20,988 --> 01:23:22,861
I was shocked when I heard
the whistle blow.

1445
01:23:22,862 --> 01:23:24,439
- It was like a scene right out of a movie.
- It's all over now.

1446
01:23:24,440 --> 01:23:26,050
- You have to come back on the show, okay?
- Okay.

1447
01:23:26,051 --> 01:23:29,085
[Ha Ha's good at getting people
on the show...]

1448
01:23:29,326 --> 01:23:32,521
- I think we need to strategize.
- Ji Hyo's really good at finding people.

1449
01:23:36,836 --> 01:23:41,659
Actually, this is no time for me to be
going around searching for Park Hee Soon.

1450
01:23:41,953 --> 01:23:45,178
I need to find a hiding place for myself.
This is no time to be searching for someone.

1451
01:23:45,535 --> 01:23:49,362
This is no time for me to be doing this now
when I don't even know where my whistle is.

1452
01:23:50,233 --> 01:23:54,293
[Must find her own hiding place whether
or not Suk Jin and Hee Soon are found.]

1453
01:23:58,175 --> 01:24:00,276
[Huh?]

1454
01:24:04,106 --> 01:24:05,816
[Blank?]

1455
01:24:05,817 --> 01:24:07,408
Okay, I got him!

1456
01:24:07,409 --> 01:24:09,394
[Gong Yoo starts chasing
after his target, Hee Soon.]

1457
01:24:13,324 --> 01:24:15,326
He totally took me by surprise just now.

1458
01:24:18,510 --> 01:24:21,205
- Ha Ha!
- Yeah, I know.

1459
01:24:22,607 --> 01:24:24,517
[Surrounded on both sides.]

1460
01:24:24,518 --> 01:24:27,048
We're all pretty much
in the same boat right now.

1461
01:24:27,049 --> 01:24:29,772
- Where's Song Ji Hyo?
- She's downstairs right now.

1462
01:24:29,773 --> 01:24:31,487
I want Ji Hyo to eliminate me.

1463
01:24:33,078 --> 01:24:35,321
- Okay, fine then.
- That's better for us.

1464
01:24:35,833 --> 01:24:39,621
- I think she already went into hiding though.
- I'll tell you where Ji Hyo is.

1465
01:24:39,622 --> 01:24:42,126
- No, we'll find her ourselves.
- Really?

1466
01:24:43,106 --> 01:24:45,309
I'm sorry.
We have no other choice, Gong Yoo.

1467
01:24:45,310 --> 01:24:47,152
- I know.
- In this situation...

1468
01:24:52,569 --> 01:24:55,082
You should've moved faster.
You did good, Hee Soon.

1469
01:24:57,041 --> 01:24:59,568
[Immediately says 'Good work' like
the cool guy that he is.]

1470
01:25:00,195 --> 01:25:03,754
[A man who's quick to give up,
Park Hee-Speedy.]

1471
01:25:03,754 --> 01:25:07,172
[Park Hee Soon- Out.]

1472
01:25:14,060 --> 01:25:18,041
[Seventh target Suk Jin, and
eighth target Ji Hyo are also ousted.]

1473
01:25:18,879 --> 01:25:23,281
<i>The next target is... Gong Yoo.
Gong Yoo is the next target.</i>

1474
01:25:23,282 --> 01:25:24,424
I think today's the day.

1475
01:25:24,459 --> 01:25:30,376
<i>Before Gong Yoo finds the red whistle,
you must eliminate your target's name tag.</i>

1476
01:25:30,377 --> 01:25:34,901
[If Gong Yoo finds the red whistle, then
he moves behind Ha Ha in the target line!]

1477
01:25:36,527 --> 01:25:40,131
[The victory is pretty much guaranteed
as long as I can find the red whistle!]

1478
01:25:41,433 --> 01:25:44,695
[Gong Yoo is feeling the pressure.]

1479
01:25:53,763 --> 01:25:57,042
[Running around swiftly to search
every corner of the building.]

1480
01:25:58,846 --> 01:26:00,441
Ugh, this is exhausting.

1481
01:26:00,442 --> 01:26:02,184
Where's the whistle?

1482
01:26:07,936 --> 01:26:09,553
There he is.
I see him right there.

1483
01:26:09,554 --> 01:26:11,492
I'm sure he's feeling quite nervous by now.

1484
01:26:11,493 --> 01:26:12,758
Aren't you?

1485
01:26:17,071 --> 01:26:18,655
Okay, I can see what he's doing.

1486
01:26:21,470 --> 01:26:23,349
He's in too nervous of a state
find the whistle right now.

1487
01:26:26,928 --> 01:26:31,912
[Having figured out Gong Yoo's location...
Ha Ha heads inside the building.]

1488
01:26:33,482 --> 01:26:35,540
[Where's the whistle?]

1489
01:26:37,005 --> 01:26:39,565
[Ha Ha is now right in front of
where Gong Yoo is standing!]

1490
01:26:48,078 --> 01:26:50,465
[Ha Ha springs his attack on Gong Yoo!]

1491
01:26:50,977 --> 01:26:52,871
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Gong Yoo.

1492
01:26:52,872 --> 01:26:54,378
I'm sorry!

1493
01:26:54,625 --> 01:26:57,992
[One of these two will become the victor!]

1494
01:26:59,531 --> 01:27:02,005
[A battle for victory between
these two good friends!]

1495
01:27:03,120 --> 01:27:05,399
Gong Yoo!
I really am sorry!

1496
01:27:05,400 --> 01:27:07,568
But this won't affect our friendship!

1497
01:27:08,273 --> 01:27:10,362
<i>But this won't affect our friendship!</i>

1498
01:27:16,302 --> 01:27:18,950
[Gong Yoo- Out!]

1499
01:27:18,951 --> 01:27:20,474
I'm sorry, my friend.

1500
01:27:20,889 --> 01:27:23,776
After three years... I finally...

1501
01:27:23,777 --> 01:27:25,914
[Ha Ha's sole victory!]

1502
01:27:28,092 --> 01:27:29,173
Hey.

1503
01:27:29,174 --> 01:27:32,693
I needed to look cool on Running Man since
I played such a cool character in the movie.

1504
01:27:33,058 --> 01:27:35,382
This is what a variety show is like.

1505
01:27:35,383 --> 01:27:40,440
Hey, this is so far from anything that
I imagined this show was going to be like.

1506
01:27:40,750 --> 01:27:43,467
A UFC champion came on our show
and had to play gong-gi in our past episode.

1507
01:27:43,467 --> 01:27:46,431
[This was only just a game...
Hope this won't affect your friendship...]

1508
01:27:48,800 --> 01:27:51,512
Get in there, Gong Yoo!
I'm sorry, my friend!

1509
01:27:51,896 --> 01:27:55,208
You idiots!
The victor of this week is me!

1510
01:27:57,344 --> 01:27:58,797
Fighting!

1511
01:27:58,798 --> 01:28:01,789
- Ha Ha actually won?
- This gold card is mine!

1512
01:28:01,790 --> 01:28:03,971
[Haroro wins a gold 'R' marked card!]

1513
01:28:04,585 --> 01:28:09,228
[The rage felt by these eight suspects
who weren't able to escape their injustice...]

1514
01:28:09,229 --> 01:28:11,755
So anyone can win on Running Man now?

1515
01:28:11,961 --> 01:28:14,475
I'll go see 'The Suspect' when it hits
the theater since I'm free now.

1516
01:28:15,040 --> 01:28:18,583
- You're going to rot away in there.
- No!

1517
01:28:19,575 --> 01:28:22,444
Ha Ha's Running Man!

1518
01:28:22,445 --> 01:28:25,235
[Ha Ha's sole victory celebration.]

1519
01:28:30,862 --> 01:28:32,050
Bye!

1520
01:28:32,051 --> 01:28:34,250
[Are you that happy?]

1521
01:28:34,815 --> 01:28:37,613
Hee Soon... are you okay?

1522
01:28:37,614 --> 01:28:40,138
- Yes, I was fine with the show.
- People's opinion of you will change.

1523
01:28:40,139 --> 01:28:42,673
- After watching this episode.
- Well, this is a variety show after all.

1524
01:28:42,674 --> 01:28:45,335
- I was just trying to be funny.
- You were just trying to be funny, right?

1525
01:28:45,336 --> 01:28:47,100
You were just trying to be entertaining.

1526
01:28:47,314 --> 01:28:49,822
And you even wore that hat
of all hats.

1527
01:28:49,823 --> 01:28:51,810
[Even his hat says 'AC'.]
(Equivalent to saying, 'Ugh'.)

1528
01:28:51,811 --> 01:28:55,003
You even earned yourself a new nickname
on our show today.

1529
01:28:55,004 --> 01:28:57,097
Park Hee-Speedy.

1530
01:28:57,098 --> 01:28:59,523
- Park Hee-Speedy.
- Gong Yoo.

1531
01:28:59,524 --> 01:29:01,555
You should come back on our show sometime
since you lost your winning today.

1532
01:29:01,555 --> 01:29:03,642
I'm already preparing myself
for the next time I'll be on.

1533
