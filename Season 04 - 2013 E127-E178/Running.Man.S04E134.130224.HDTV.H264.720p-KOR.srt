[Giraffe looking nervous for some reason.]

25
00:01:37,012 --> 00:01:40,361
[The reason for that being...]

26
00:01:40,362 --> 00:01:46,098
[The order he heard last night...]

27
00:01:46,098 --> 00:01:48,920

Hey, I think I know what that word is.

31
00:02:03,737 --> 00:02:05,326
'Soji' means, 'Young lady'.

32
00:02:10,954 --> 00:02:13,166
Ground... I think she's saying above ground
instead of underground.

33
00:02:15,379 --> 00:02:17,824
We're not going to get what she's saying even
if we stand here listening for the next year.

34
00:02:18,348 --> 00:02:25,996
[Since he has no idea what the mission is, he
got up early to see what the others are up to.]

35
00:02:27,142 --> 00:02:28,589
Is Suk Jin still sleeping?

36
00:02:30,818 --> 00:02:35,854
[None of his own team members
seem to be awake yet...]

[Silence]

39
00:02:42,791 --> 00:02:45,050
Don't most of our missions start
before 7 a.m.?

40
00:02:48,352 --> 00:02:52,576
[Even the rooms of other members
remain silent...]

41
00:02:53,315 --> 00:02:54,910

[Green Team's order is given in English!]

Did you have fun in Macau today?

49
00:03:32,835 --> 00:03:34,502
Did you have fun in Macau today?

50
00:03:35,066 --> 00:03:37,852
[English...]

51
00:03:37,853 --> 00:03:41,532
In order to get the remaining swords...

52
00:03:41,806 --> 00:03:43,606
you need to go to Vietnam.

53
00:03:43,607 --> 00:03:46,748
So tomorrow morning at 7 a.m...

54
00:03:47,158 --> 00:03:52,870
you need to wake up and be at
the airport by 9 a.m. tomorrow.

55
00:03:53,488 --> 00:03:56,522
- His English is a bit hard to understand.
- I think I sort of understand it.

56
00:03:56,733 --> 00:04:01,867
[By putting together a few of the words,
they get a slight idea of what the order is.]

57
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,880
[Ji Hyo wakes up exactly
at 7 a.m. as ordered.]

58
00:04:04,881 --> 00:04:06,253
Does my makeup look okay?

59
00:04:13,811 --> 00:04:15,063
<i>Where are you going?</i>

60
00:04:15,765 --> 00:04:16,769
Where are you going?

[Gets discovered by the Giraffe
who's been out foraging for his prey.]

62
00:04:18,999 --> 00:04:21,641
[An out of the blue chase in the morning.]

63
00:04:22,427 --> 00:04:26,885
[Just a relief that the whole floor was being
occupied by only the members and the staff.]

64
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,332
- What are you doing!
- Be quiet.

65
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:31,679
Why are you doing this to me?

66
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,062
- What is this so early in the morning?
- Why are you out here?

67
00:04:33,063 --> 00:04:34,541
- What?
- Why are you out in the hallway?

68
00:04:34,542 --> 00:04:36,021
What do you mean, why am I out here?

69
00:04:36,614 --> 00:04:38,859
- Where are you going?
- What do you mean, where am I going?

70
00:04:39,256 --> 00:04:40,880
I'm going to Vietnam!

71
00:04:40,881 --> 00:04:42,290
I'm going to Vietnam!

72
00:04:44,816 --> 00:04:47,133
[Viet...nam?]

73
00:04:48,069 --> 00:04:50,520
- Why are you going to Vietnam?
- Didn't you see the notice?

74
00:04:51,341 --> 00:04:55,316
We all have to get ready and get to
the airport because we're going to Vietnam.

75
00:04:56,343 --> 00:04:58,029
But everyone's still asleep.

76
00:04:59,614 --> 00:05:01,705
What language did your translator speak?

77
00:05:02,128 --> 00:05:04,954
- Chinese.
- She spoke Chinese?

78
00:05:04,955 --> 00:05:09,130
- It's possible that she spoke something else.
- But you were clapping like you understood.

79
00:05:09,376 --> 00:05:11,120
- That looked really natural, right?
- Yeah.

80
00:05:11,121 --> 00:05:12,705
I had no idea what she was saying.

81
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:16,086
Hurry up and go get ready.

82
00:05:16,378 --> 00:05:18,041
Isn't the mission in Macau?

83
00:05:18,042 --> 00:05:20,917
[Extremely confused and flustered Giraffe.]

84
00:05:20,918 --> 00:05:23,354
Shouldn't you at least let us know
where we're filming the show?

85
00:05:25,721 --> 00:05:27,438
<i>What a joke...</i>

86
00:05:27,816 --> 00:05:29,158
<i>Save me!</i>

87
00:05:29,159 --> 00:05:31,756
- Kang Gary!
- Wait! I don't have any clothes on.

88
00:05:33,098 --> 00:05:35,150
[Dressed or not...]

89
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:37,209
Don't open the door.
Don't open the door.

90
00:05:37,592 --> 00:05:40,174
What are you doing up already?
When you're one of the biggest sleepy heads.

91
00:05:40,599 --> 00:05:42,799
- Open the door.
- Lee Kwang Soo's lost his mind. Hurry.

92
00:05:43,953 --> 00:05:48,934
[The door finally gets opened,
and he treats his guests to a morning apple.]

93
00:05:48,934 --> 00:05:51,684
- Why are you up already?
- I went to bed early and just woke up.

94
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:54,119
I usually wake up early to have
my morning apple.

95
00:05:57,349 --> 00:06:01,282
Just go and tell... your team members
to get up and get ready.

96
00:06:01,283 --> 00:06:02,660
They're all still asleep.

97
00:06:02,661 --> 00:06:04,572
They won't open the door
even when I ring the doorbell.

98
00:06:05,996 --> 00:06:10,036
[Who was it that rang my doorbell earlier?]

99
00:06:10,157 --> 00:06:12,364
We decided to take the bus there.

100
00:06:12,365 --> 00:06:16,038
We were told that if we take the 64 route,
the bus will take us all the way to Vietnam.

101
00:06:16,039 --> 00:06:18,529
You just need to take the route 64
in front of the Macau tower.

102
00:06:20,242 --> 00:06:22,322
- Hurry up and go get ready.
- Seriously, go get ready quickly.

103
00:06:22,323 --> 00:06:24,488
We've just given you a very important
piece of information.

104
00:06:24,506 --> 00:06:30,362
[Giraffe is slowly starting to accept
the fact that they're heading to Vietnam.]

105
00:06:30,362 --> 00:06:31,761
Go get ready.
Go wash up and get ready.

106
00:06:33,525 --> 00:06:36,096
[At the same time]

107
00:06:36,998 --> 00:06:38,305
Did everyone leave already?

108
00:06:38,306 --> 00:06:43,117
[Yellow Team's Jae Suk and Ro-Ro
who are already all ready to go.]

109
00:06:43,118 --> 00:06:44,814
We've been out here waiting for you.

110
00:06:44,814 --> 00:06:47,280
We need to get on the move.

111
00:06:47,281 --> 00:06:50,150
[All ready to go? In which
language were they given the order?]

112
00:06:52,186 --> 00:06:54,068
Hello, Running Man members.

113
00:06:54,069 --> 00:06:56,916
[Their order was given in Korean!]

114
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:58,564
Did you have fun in Macau today?

115
00:07:00,533 --> 00:07:02,603
In order to find the remaining daggers...

116
00:07:02,604 --> 00:07:03,932
you have to go to Vietnam.

117
00:07:04,888 --> 00:07:07,700
You have to wake up at
7 a.m. tomorrow...

118
00:07:07,701 --> 00:07:10,102
and get to the airport by 9 a.m.

119
00:07:10,103 --> 00:07:11,726
But how... we just got here today.

120
00:07:11,727 --> 00:07:15,311
Each team has to figure out their
own way of getting to the airport.

121
00:07:15,312 --> 00:07:17,788
If by any chance,
you can't get to the airport on time

122
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:21,201
you won't be able to do the mission together
and will have to return to Korea.

123
00:07:22,035 --> 00:07:24,561
<i>You won't be able to do the mission together
and will have to return to Korea.</i>

124
00:07:24,596 --> 00:07:26,831
[These people may have to
go back to Korea...]

125
00:07:29,251 --> 00:07:32,309
[They're already on their way,
and Gary's room now sits vacant.]

126
00:07:33,378 --> 00:07:36,419
[Finally understanding
the seriousness of the situation!]

127
00:07:36,419 --> 00:07:37,655
Suk Jin, they're all gone.

128
00:07:37,656 --> 00:07:39,181
- Where did they go?
- Everyone's already gone.

129
00:07:39,182 --> 00:07:41,665
All the other teams are really gone.
No one's in their rooms anymore.

130
00:07:41,666 --> 00:07:44,563
- That's seriously...
- I'm not positive, but we need to hurry.

131
00:07:44,564 --> 00:07:46,963
Hey!
Jong Kook!

132
00:07:47,494 --> 00:07:50,540
- Where is he? What's he doing?
- It takes him two hours to get ready.

133
00:07:50,541 --> 00:07:52,111
[Mr. Capable is still getting ready after
being awoken from the doorbell earlier.]

134
00:07:52,111 --> 00:07:53,482
Everyone's gone.

135
00:07:54,726 --> 00:07:57,070
Where's Hye Jin? I was
told she's down here somewhere.

136
00:07:57,878 --> 00:07:59,164
There they are.

137
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:02,522
- Where have you been?
- Where were you?

138
00:08:02,523 --> 00:08:04,665
- I was having some breakfast.
- Really?

139
00:08:05,062 --> 00:08:06,350
I needed to get some food.

140
00:08:06,351 --> 00:08:08,165
- Let's go, Hye Jin.
- Okay, let's go.

141
00:08:08,166 --> 00:08:09,495
Over there.

142
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:12,500
Good morning, Sir.

143
00:08:12,501 --> 00:08:15,759
[Yellow Team is the first
to head to the airport!]

144
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,398
<i>International airport, please.</i>

145
00:08:19,804 --> 00:08:22,041
[Blue Team short on time.]

146
00:08:22,714 --> 00:08:25,440
Wait for me... go at my pace, okay?

147
00:08:25,441 --> 00:08:28,115
[On top of being already late, they
now have an injured tiger to deal with.]

148
00:08:31,183 --> 00:08:36,400
[Guessing ridiculous things from the
Chinese that they couldn't understand...]

149
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:39,698
[Their answer is to follow the other teams!]

150
00:08:39,699 --> 00:08:41,124
We're really late, Jong Kook.

151
00:08:42,363 --> 00:08:44,783
If we can't catch up to them out there,
it's over for us. We need to rush.

152
00:08:46,325 --> 00:08:49,771
[But just then...]

153
00:08:49,771 --> 00:08:51,988
[Discovers the Green Team
on their way out!]

154
00:08:52,953 --> 00:08:54,940
[Nice timing...]

155
00:08:55,698 --> 00:08:58,042
Don't you think we need to get a taxi
and catch up to them?

156
00:09:00,753 --> 00:09:03,454
- Hey... we need to catch up to them. Hurry!
- Hurry... hurry!

157
00:09:06,322 --> 00:09:09,147
- Excuse me... follow...
- Follow.

158
00:09:09,148 --> 00:09:11,177
<i>That car... follow, okay?</i>

159
00:09:11,178 --> 00:09:13,733
What's going to happen to the Blue Team
if Jong Kook is still asleep?

160
00:09:14,031 --> 00:09:16,084
I'm sure they'll come on their own.
Don't worry about it.

161
00:09:16,085 --> 00:09:18,599
- That's them, isn't it?
- Yeah, I think it's them up there.

162
00:09:20,079 --> 00:09:22,150
Doesn't it feel like we're in
a spy movie?

163
00:09:22,151 --> 00:09:24,617
It's like we're shooting a spy movie
here in Macau.

164
00:09:27,837 --> 00:09:31,089
[The two teams are stopped next to one
another at the red traffic light.]

165
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:33,347
<i>- What the heck?
- What is that?</i>

166
00:09:36,137 --> 00:09:37,722
They must've followed us.

167
00:09:40,302 --> 00:09:41,625

00:29:33,208 --> 00:29:36,215
Yes, high five!
Rock, paper, high five!

501
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:38,607
High five, yes, yes!

502
00:29:38,608 --> 00:29:40,127
Rock, paper, high five!

503
00:29:40,128 --> 00:29:41,680
High five!

504
00:29:42,571 --> 00:29:45,139
Okay, okay... Rock, paper, bread!

505
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:47,000
[Aren't you going to do it?]

506
00:29:48,779 --> 00:29:51,119
[Putting a lot of effort into
teasing the shop keeper...]

507
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,973
Okay, okay, let's go!

508
00:29:53,387 --> 00:29:55,679
Okay, rock, paper, scissors!

509
00:29:56,564 --> 00:29:58,639
[Darn...]

510
00:29:59,517 --> 00:30:01,223
[Defeated]

511
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:05,325
[After all that teasing...]

512
00:30:09,432 --> 00:30:12,212
- He could just give us small ones!
- Small, small!

513
00:30:12,213 --> 00:30:14,188
- Where do we go?
- Should we go straight?

514
00:30:14,189 --> 00:30:19,326
<i>Kim Jong Kook!
Kim Jong Kook!</i>

515
00:30:19,326 --> 00:30:21,143
They're still saying Lee Kwang Soo
even though you're saying Kim Jong Kook.

516
00:30:21,143 --> 00:30:22,171
What's going on here?

517
00:30:22,172 --> 00:30:24,167
[Instead of Jong Kook's name,
they're chanting Kwang Soo's name?]

518
00:30:24,955 --> 00:30:27,220
[I'm the Giraffe of Asia!]

519
00:30:29,388 --> 00:30:31,885
<i>Lee Kwang Soo!
Lee Kwang Soo!</i>

520
00:30:33,345 --> 00:30:36,138
[Question one:
Is his name just easy to shout out?]

521
00:30:37,504 --> 00:30:40,519
[Question two: Could his name
mean something in Vietnamese?]

522
00:30:43,022 --> 00:30:45,434
[A shocking reaction from the crowd.]

523
00:30:46,096 --> 00:30:48,522
[A fascinating crowd with their
fervor for the Giraffe.]

524
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:53,089
[Due to their slow pace, the scene's been
transformed into an impromptu fan meeting.]

525
00:30:55,285 --> 00:30:57,646
[It's Jae Suk!]

526
00:30:59,597 --> 00:31:00,890
Ji Hyo...

527
00:31:02,472 --> 00:31:03,754
Ji Hyo, bet it all.

528
00:31:05,137 --> 00:31:07,736
- Bet it all.
- Get yourself together!

529
00:31:07,737 --> 00:31:10,487
- Winning this isn't easy, Jae Suk!
- Ji Hyo, bet it all.

530
00:31:10,488 --> 00:31:12,423
- Get yourself together!
- One... just bet one.

531
00:31:12,424 --> 00:31:14,791
Ji Hyo... my shoulder
feels like it's going to fall off.

532
00:31:15,324 --> 00:31:16,754
- Just bet it all.
- Bet it all.

533
00:31:16,755 --> 00:31:19,457
[With the pain in his shoulders,
he's teetering on the edge of insanity.]

534
00:31:19,983 --> 00:31:21,384
Ji Hyo, bet everything.

535
00:31:21,385 --> 00:31:22,547
Bet one whole basket.

536
00:31:23,185 --> 00:31:24,335
One basket.

537
00:31:24,705 --> 00:31:25,846
Rock, paper, scissors.

538
00:31:25,847 --> 00:31:27,505
- Want me to do it? Should I?
- Do it.

539
00:31:27,506 --> 00:31:31,315
[With one whole basket on the line,
Big-nosed Brother starts the challenge.]

540
00:31:31,316 --> 00:31:32,604
[This time... I will win!]

541
00:31:33,684 --> 00:31:35,222
[No way...]

542
00:31:36,543 --> 00:31:39,335
[Will he win?]

543
00:31:41,649 --> 00:31:44,993
[With one whole basket
hanging on the line...]

544
00:31:49,945 --> 00:31:55,383
<i>Rock, paper, scissors!</i>

545
00:32:00,125 --> 00:32:03,377
[The damned scissors...]

546
00:32:03,378 --> 00:32:05,085
How are we supposed to carry
all these around?

547
00:32:06,068 --> 00:32:08,555
Jae Suk, let's just load up and go
to the shop next door.

548
00:32:08,555 --> 00:32:10,569
- Okay, the shop next door.
- All this fruit...

549
00:32:11,062 --> 00:32:13,499
[Green Team with a whole other
basket added to their load.]

550
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:14,683
Ji Hyo, let's go.

551
00:32:16,770 --> 00:32:17,991
Let's go to the shop next door.

552
00:32:23,219 --> 00:32:24,219
- All this.
- Bet it all.

553
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:26,819
[Nothing to even think about anymore?
Going all in?]

554
00:32:27,671 --> 00:32:31,763
- This woman...
- She's the one who's good at it.

555
00:32:31,764 --> 00:32:32,967
She is the master of rock, paper, scissors.

556
00:32:32,967 --> 00:32:34,497
Rock, paper, scissors Master.

557
00:32:34,498 --> 00:32:36,059
- Bet it all.
- Rock, paper, scissors.

558
00:32:36,481 --> 00:32:39,099
- Everything... all in!
- All in!

559
00:32:39,977 --> 00:32:43,627
[No time!
Going all in?]

560
00:32:45,045 --> 00:32:48,005
[Betting all three of their baskets...]

561
00:32:48,863 --> 00:32:50,833
Rock, paper, scissors!

562
00:32:50,834 --> 00:32:52,917
Rock, paper, scissors!

563
00:32:53,422 --> 00:32:55,483
[Jae Suk wins!]

564
00:32:59,447 --> 00:33:00,818
[Oh... not bad?]

565
00:33:01,155 --> 00:33:02,788
Ji Hyo... we're all in.
You have to get it done.

566
00:33:02,789 --> 00:33:05,057
[Ace Ji Hyo's turn.]

567
00:33:05,058 --> 00:33:06,211
Ji Hyo, we're all in.

568
00:33:06,212 --> 00:33:07,532
<i>We're all in.</i>

569
00:33:08,768 --> 00:33:10,646
We're not backing down from this.

570
00:33:13,431 --> 00:33:15,987
[Okay... let's do this!]

571
00:33:16,493 --> 00:33:20,049
[Ace Blank Ji vs.
Master of rock, paper, scissors grandmother.]

572
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:24,014
Rock, paper...

573
00:33:27,021 --> 00:33:29,028
Rock, paper, scissors!

574
00:33:32,854 --> 00:33:35,770
[Lost again...]

575
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:41,329
[Defeated after having gone all in...]

576
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:49,913
They can't even lift all that.

577
00:33:53,666 --> 00:33:56,092
[Green Team's baskets flowing over the top.]

578
00:33:58,571 --> 00:34:00,004
[Bowed to the extreme]

579
00:34:01,775 --> 00:34:06,212
[Enough fruit to open up their own shop.]

580
00:34:06,212 --> 00:34:08,039
Let's go win this thing.

581
00:34:08,759 --> 00:34:10,022
Hey, let's go win this thing.

582
00:34:10,023 --> 00:34:13,881
[Blue Team with 16 fruits still remaining
is going to win this thing?]

583
00:34:15,442 --> 00:34:18,219
[The speed of their movement
is the same as a turtle's.]

584
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:23,436
Ma'am!

585
00:34:26,578 --> 00:34:28,289
All in!
All in!

586
00:34:29,222 --> 00:34:32,629
[Okay, whatever... let's bet it all!]

587
00:34:33,559 --> 00:34:35,803
- All in.
- All in. We're going to go all in!

588
00:34:36,177 --> 00:34:38,343
- 16.
- 16... we're going to go all in!

589
00:34:38,344 --> 00:34:40,272
[Blue Team also goes all in
with their 16 remaining fruits.]

590
00:34:40,272 --> 00:34:41,863
We're going to win this no matter what.

591
00:34:43,396 --> 00:34:44,793
[I don't think so.]

592
00:34:44,794 --> 00:34:47,575
Can you please let us win
just this once?

593
00:34:48,091 --> 00:34:50,429
This is too hard.
Very tired.

594
00:34:50,430 --> 00:34:52,655
Very heavy.

595
00:34:53,174 --> 00:34:56,581
[But still... a win is a win!]

596
00:34:57,041 --> 00:34:59,187
[Starting off with Blank Ji.]

597
00:34:59,784 --> 00:35:01,285
[I will show no mercy!]

598
00:35:03,607 --> 00:35:04,611
All in!

599
00:35:04,612 --> 00:35:05,776
All in!

600
00:35:06,551 --> 00:35:08,693
Rock, paper, scissors!

601
00:35:09,043 --> 00:35:11,130
[Oh... Blank Ji wins!]

602
00:35:11,130 --> 00:35:12,387
Rock, paper, scissors!

603
00:35:12,388 --> 00:35:14,375
[Sweeps the first round with a win.]

604
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:18,243
[Next up is their wild card,
Big-nosed Brother.]

605
00:35:21,371 --> 00:35:23,331
[Being cheered on by the fans.]

606
00:35:23,332 --> 00:35:25,181
Rock, paper, scissors!

607
00:35:30,411 --> 00:35:33,283
[If Jae Suk wins, it's a perfect win!]

608
00:35:34,545 --> 00:35:36,187
- Again?
- Yes, one more.

609
00:35:36,641 --> 00:35:38,307
Rock, paper, scissors!

610
00:35:38,308 --> 00:35:39,974
[Blue Team is also playing
with everything on the line.]

611
00:35:40,827 --> 00:35:43,968
They don't throw out a lot of scissors.
It's usually paper or a rock.

612
00:35:47,269 --> 00:35:48,387
Okay.

613
00:35:48,703 --> 00:35:51,790
[Will Dong Wook's scissors win?]

614
00:35:54,273 --> 00:35:55,710
Rock, paper, scissors!

615
00:35:55,711 --> 00:35:58,067
[Their guess is right on the money?]

616
00:35:58,550 --> 00:36:00,581
[Dong Wook wins the first round.]

617
00:36:00,954 --> 00:36:03,476
- Because we did it so quickly...
- Doing it quickly flustered her.

618
00:36:03,477 --> 00:36:05,212
We flustered her.
Wait, let's think.

619
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:10,547
- Scissors. Throw out scissors.
- Rock, paper, scissors!

620
00:36:13,678 --> 00:36:16,144
[Just as they guessed,
win with the scissors again!]

621
00:36:16,145 --> 00:36:18,118
We got it... we got it.

622
00:36:18,118 --> 00:36:21,285
[Now if only Mr. Capable can win...]

623
00:36:22,254 --> 00:36:25,151
[And in this team,
Jae Suk is the only one left.]

624
00:36:27,403 --> 00:36:29,776
[With extreme nervousness.]

625
00:36:30,475 --> 00:36:32,352
Jae Suk, we're all in.
Everything's riding on you.

626
00:36:32,976 --> 00:36:36,007
[Dear Lord of variety shows...]

627
00:36:38,872 --> 00:36:41,749
[Mr. Capable and Jae Suk with the fate
of their teams riding on their shoulders...]

628
00:36:42,481 --> 00:36:44,020
You just need to do it this once!

629
00:36:44,021 --> 00:36:46,567
[Throw out the scissors again?]

630
00:36:46,568 --> 00:36:48,347
- It could work.
- No...

631
00:36:50,564 --> 00:36:52,369
[Come on, let's go!]

632
00:36:53,907 --> 00:36:56,139
[Just what is his vision telling him?]

633
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:59,512
Rock, paper, scissors!

634
00:37:02,151 --> 00:37:04,793
[Will it be scissors? Paper?]

635
00:37:06,327 --> 00:37:09,183
[The fateful rock, paper, scissors...]

636
00:37:09,183 --> 00:37:10,933
[Jong Kook wins!]

637
00:37:10,933 --> 00:37:12,989
[Jae Suk also wins!]

638
00:37:13,745 --> 00:37:16,822
[Green Team and Blue Team
succeeds their missions!]

639
00:37:17,576 --> 00:37:20,663
[All-in's win for win!]

640
00:37:25,864 --> 00:37:27,421
- We did it!
- All-in!

641
00:37:31,223 --> 00:37:32,729
- Thank you.
- Thank you!

642
00:37:32,730 --> 00:37:34,312
Thank you... thank you!

643
00:37:37,666 --> 00:37:39,383
Okay, let's go.

644
00:37:40,505 --> 00:37:43,273
- This is it.
- I'm so beyond elated!

645
00:37:44,011 --> 00:37:45,047
Let's go, let's go.

646
00:37:45,048 --> 00:37:47,694
[Their exciting victory.]

647
00:37:47,695 --> 00:37:49,381
Thank you so much.

648
00:37:49,382 --> 00:37:52,883
[The two teams who were at the risk
of seriously damaging their shoulders...]

649
00:37:55,171 --> 00:37:59,141
[Who will take possession of the dagger
from this mission?]

650
00:38:01,953 --> 00:38:03,292
- Thank you!
- Thank you.

651
00:38:03,293 --> 00:38:05,431
[Green Team]

652
00:38:06,411 --> 00:38:10,040
[Goes to the Green Team who got
to the dagger first.]

653
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,469
Thank you, Ma'am!

654
00:38:12,127 --> 00:38:14,803
[The Green Team wins a dagger!]

655
00:38:16,873 --> 00:38:18,675
<i>We still got second place though.</i>

656
00:38:18,676 --> 00:38:23,117
- We got rid of them all between two places.
- We were good with the analyzing, right?

657
00:38:23,214 --> 00:38:26,130
When it comes to analyzing things,
Jong Kook really is...

658
00:38:26,131 --> 00:38:29,252
Wow... seriously...
when it comes to analyzing...

659
00:38:29,253 --> 00:38:31,297
- We did it.
- We did it. We really did it.

660
00:38:31,298 --> 00:38:34,682
<i>- Lee Kwang Soo, you're something else here.
- It's very impressive.</i>

661
00:38:34,683 --> 00:38:37,271
Vietnam, I love you.
I love Vietnam.

662
00:38:37,272 --> 00:38:38,725
I thought Thailand was your love.

663
00:38:38,726 --> 00:38:40,477
And I love Thailand.

664
00:38:41,342 --> 00:38:43,117
And Hong Kong.

665
00:38:43,118 --> 00:38:44,822
- Macau...
- China and Macau too.

666
00:38:45,686 --> 00:38:48,497
I have very many hearts.

667
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:52,301
- Very many hearts?
- My heart is yours.

668
00:38:53,650 --> 00:38:55,550
[I guess 'heart' can be used to describe
feelings as well as being an organ...]

669
00:38:55,550 --> 00:38:59,322
Are you telling everyone that
you're going to donate your heart right now?

670
00:38:59,322 --> 00:39:01,210
- How do you get that?

00:48:29,773 --> 00:48:31,614
- And she called it 'Cha Cha Cha'.
- I couldn't think of it.

839
00:48:31,615 --> 00:48:33,483
The song that she said was 'Cha Cha Cha'...

840
00:48:36,903 --> 00:48:39,468
[Each getting to sample the shrimp bread.]

841
00:48:40,775 --> 00:48:42,538
[Second question]

842
00:48:45,943 --> 00:48:47,598
All the songs really sound alike.

843
00:48:56,113 --> 00:48:59,246
- Super Junior's 'Sorry, sorry'.
- That's what you always say!

844
00:49:00,224 --> 00:49:01,902
[Oh! Correct answer!]

845
00:49:04,877 --> 00:49:06,183
She really got it right?

846
00:49:06,184 --> 00:49:09,342
[Hye Jin guesses it correctly after
thinking everything was 'Sorry, sorry'.]

847
00:49:10,785 --> 00:49:13,043
[Verifying the answer]

848
00:49:14,432 --> 00:49:17,936
[What she was saying was, 'sorry, sorry'.]

849
00:49:22,406 --> 00:49:25,900
[It's time to start worrying
about the numbers...]

850
00:49:26,962 --> 00:49:29,088
[Jae Suk just keeps on going.]

851
00:49:29,089 --> 00:49:32,887
<i>I don't think he's worried about the game,
but is just eating because it's good.</i>

852
00:49:37,078 --> 00:49:39,856
[Looks like he's happy to see
Jae Suk enjoying the dish so much.]

853
00:49:42,349 --> 00:49:44,186
[Only about ten left on the tray.]

854
00:49:44,790 --> 00:49:45,947
Enjoy it and eat a lot, okay?

855
00:49:45,947 --> 00:49:48,736
[Chef with no limit on how many he can
eat, just how many will he eat?]

856
00:49:51,125 --> 00:49:52,257
<i>Stop? Stop?</i>

857
00:49:52,257 --> 00:49:55,594
[Chef doesn't look as though
he's about to stop anytime soon.]

858
00:49:56,278 --> 00:49:58,114
Go, go, go, go!
Go, go!

859
00:50:01,628 --> 00:50:04,142
[Wait? At this rate...]

860
00:50:07,297 --> 00:50:08,962
- Okay.
- Okay!

861
00:50:08,963 --> 00:50:11,181
[Eats another]

862
00:50:12,750 --> 00:50:14,451
[Oh? Look at this guy...]

863
00:50:18,558 --> 00:50:19,995
I have to win... I really have to win.

864
00:50:19,996 --> 00:50:24,780
<i>If you tell him, 'Gae-took',
it means 'stop' in Vietnamese.</i>

865
00:50:24,781 --> 00:50:25,940
Gae-took!

866
00:50:26,306 --> 00:50:27,683
- No.
- No?

867
00:50:27,684 --> 00:50:28,938
- No.
- Okay, eat.

868
00:50:28,939 --> 00:50:29,990
Go, go!

869
00:50:37,706 --> 00:50:38,723
We're good, we're good!

870
00:50:38,724 --> 00:50:40,198
[This is good...]

871
00:50:41,388 --> 00:50:43,259
[Inhales]

872
00:50:44,095 --> 00:50:46,047
[I can't be...]

873
00:50:47,244 --> 00:50:49,192
[One last remaining...]

874
00:50:49,192 --> 00:50:50,474
Gae-took!

875
00:50:51,844 --> 00:50:54,148
[I'll stop now.]

876
00:50:56,050 --> 00:50:58,278
How can you do this to me?

877
00:50:58,279 --> 00:51:00,055
- Gae-took?
- Yes, Gae-took.

878
00:51:00,055 --> 00:51:01,964
Eat it!
You were eating so well!

879
00:51:05,274 --> 00:51:08,430
[Ha Ha - disqualified.]

880
00:51:08,431 --> 00:51:10,453
- You're the best!
- That was great!

881
00:51:13,027 --> 00:51:15,646
Gae-took.
I really like that, Gae-took.

882
00:51:15,647 --> 00:51:18,316
<i>Since the game is over for you anyway,
just eat it since it's good.</i>

883
00:51:25,189 --> 00:51:27,061
[Chef who loves to laugh.]

884
00:51:27,061 --> 00:51:29,642
I hope we get another delicious dish.
That was so good.

885
00:51:30,060 --> 00:51:31,999
[Next up on the menu is...]

886
00:51:31,999 --> 00:51:35,019
- It's rice noodles!
- I love noodles!

887
00:51:35,020 --> 00:51:37,337
[Vietnam's representative dish,
rice noodles.]

888
00:51:38,031 --> 00:51:39,937
Rice noodles!

889
00:51:39,938 --> 00:51:42,030
Pho!

890
00:51:43,658 --> 00:51:48,355
[And so, the new groom doesn't get to
taste the flavors of the noodle dish.]

891
00:51:49,937 --> 00:51:52,546
[Asia's Prince, Giraffe
arrives at his destination.]

892
00:51:54,733 --> 00:51:58,097
[An even bigger crowd awaiting his arrival.]

893
00:52:00,643 --> 00:52:03,957
[Vegetarian Giraffe pulling in a huge crowd
everywhere he goes.]

894
00:52:06,860 --> 00:52:09,654
[The mission that awaits them here is?]

895
00:52:09,655 --> 00:52:11,716
<i>You can all read the mission together.</i>

896
00:52:12,744 --> 00:52:16,405
<i>[Blindfold one person and have that person
swipe the hats off the other two's heads.]</i>

897
00:52:17,022 --> 00:52:18,904
- What does that mean?
- Here?

898
00:52:20,308 --> 00:52:23,298
<i>It's like hide and seek.
Two people need to go and hide.</i>

899
00:52:23,299 --> 00:52:27,091
Wait... I can't hear anything right now with
the crowd shouting out Kwang Soo's name.

900
00:52:27,091 --> 00:52:28,737
Can you explain it one more time?

901
00:52:28,738 --> 00:52:30,185
<i>I'll explain it to you once more.</i>

902
00:52:30,186 --> 00:52:31,866
<i>One person will be blindfolded...</i>

903
00:52:31,866 --> 00:52:34,369
[Inside this Vietnamese wrap restaurant...]

904
00:52:34,369 --> 00:52:38,920
[One person is the seeker and the
other two will escape with the hats on.]

905
00:52:39,333 --> 00:52:42,336
[The person who catches the other two in the
shortest amount of time is the winner!]

906
00:52:43,319 --> 00:52:49,775
[Restaurant near the West Lake that
serves up delicious Vietnamese rice wraps.]

907
00:52:51,270 --> 00:52:53,898
- Let's do rock, paper, scissors.
- The winner decides who goes?

908
00:52:53,899 --> 00:52:55,259
<i>Rock, paper, scissors.</i>

909
00:52:55,883 --> 00:52:58,532
[The decision is up to the winner, Gary.]

910
00:53:00,537 --> 00:53:02,838
Going first is disadvantageous.
In that case...

911
00:53:03,558 --> 00:53:06,843
- Kwang Soo, you go first.
- Why me?

912
00:53:06,844 --> 00:53:08,242
No, Kwang Soo, you go first.

913
00:53:08,243 --> 00:53:10,164
You think just because you do that,
things will happen between you two?

914
00:53:10,164 --> 00:53:12,268
She's putting on that pouty face.

915
00:53:12,743 --> 00:53:14,876
Why are you doing this?
What is that?

916
00:53:15,381 --> 00:53:17,565
[Putting on the cute act?]

917
00:53:17,565 --> 00:53:19,654
[Putting on the cute act for him?]

918
00:53:22,373 --> 00:53:24,495
- Okay, then Ji Hyo can go last.
- What the heck is that?

919
00:53:25,347 --> 00:53:27,588
[Ji Hyo is the very last to go.]

920
00:53:27,589 --> 00:53:29,804
- But I don't have a single dagger.
- Kwang Soo will go first.

921
00:53:29,804 --> 00:53:32,123
- Then I'll go and Ji Hyo will go last.
- Yes!

922
00:53:32,824 --> 00:53:35,083
- Kwang Soo, you'll be fine.
- Lee Kwang Soo!

923
00:53:35,808 --> 00:53:39,326
[But the crowd outside are all
Giraffe's fans?]

924
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:43,785
[Give me strength as
I'm stuck between this couple.]

925
00:53:44,682 --> 00:53:46,691
[Take all the strength you need from us!]

926
00:53:52,924 --> 00:53:54,768
[Kwang Soo the seeker, is first to start.]

927
00:53:56,226 --> 00:53:58,806
Shouldn't you still be clapping?
You have to clap.

928
00:53:59,933 --> 00:54:02,837
[Incites the crowd to scream.]

929
00:54:04,167 --> 00:54:07,757
[Confusing him with
all the screams from his fans.]

930
00:54:23,684 --> 00:54:25,072
Wait! Wait!

931
00:54:25,073 --> 00:54:26,287
Be quiet!
Quiet!

932
00:54:26,288 --> 00:54:29,094
[Asking them to stop chanting his name?]

933
00:54:36,959 --> 00:54:41,163
[If the Prince of Asia tells us to...]

934
00:54:45,484 --> 00:54:49,053
[The crowd falls into silence.]

935
00:54:51,569 --> 00:54:54,136
[Asia's Giraffe concentrating with
all his might.]

936
00:55:00,053 --> 00:55:02,055
[Gary in danger!]

937
00:55:02,761 --> 00:55:04,849
[Gary barely able to make his escape.]

938
00:55:06,265 --> 00:55:08,542
[Giraffe's moves definitely becoming
more clear than earlier.]

939
00:55:17,510 --> 00:55:19,294
Kwang Soo!

940
00:55:19,295 --> 00:55:20,645
Kwang Soo!

941
00:55:20,646 --> 00:55:22,448
[Gary - out!]

942
00:55:25,382 --> 00:55:26,870
[Just one more.]

943
00:55:32,581 --> 00:55:34,071
[Ji Hyo tries to joke around...]

944
00:55:34,071 --> 00:55:38,174
[and totally gets caught by the Giraffe.]

945
00:55:40,301 --> 00:55:42,724
[Ji Hyo - out!]

946
00:55:46,471 --> 00:55:49,000
[All hail, Lee Kwang Soo!]

947
00:55:50,417 --> 00:55:53,224
[Feels like the whole neighborhood
is celebrating!]

948
00:55:56,192 --> 00:55:59,560
[I am the Giraffe!]

949
00:56:00,121 --> 00:56:02,579
[But seriously... why is he so popular?]

950
00:56:05,558 --> 00:56:08,195
[Everyone has each guessed
one question correctly.]

951
00:56:19,478 --> 00:56:23,076
[This song will determine
the direction of the dagger...]

952
00:56:25,092 --> 00:56:27,344
[Totally clueless...]

953
00:56:34,198 --> 00:56:36,356
What are you singing?

954
00:56:36,357 --> 00:56:38,554
'Unbelievable sorts' by Yook-gaksu!

955
00:56:38,776 --> 00:56:41,016
- How could you think that?
- That's what she was singing!

956
00:56:44,378 --> 00:56:45,818
Is it a current song?

957
00:56:45,819 --> 00:56:47,340
It's not a very recent song, right?

958
00:57:05,812 --> 00:57:08,727
- Sorry to ask, but do you have any clue?
- I have no idea.

959
00:57:08,728 --> 00:57:11,768
- Can you give us a hint?
- I don't know about Hye Jin...

960
00:57:12,368 --> 00:57:14,746
[With her singing so well,
no hint will be given!]

961
00:57:34,034 --> 00:57:35,427
[Does Hye Jin have a guess?]

962
00:57:35,427 --> 00:57:37,886
- Park Hyun Bin's 'Sha-bang, Sha-bang'?
- No way...

963
00:57:37,887 --> 00:57:39,847
I doubt it's a trot.

964
00:57:40,984 --> 00:57:42,797
[Wow! Correct answer!]

965
00:57:44,556 --> 00:57:47,253
[Hye Jin wins this mission!]

966
00:57:54,418 --> 00:57:57,356
[A joyful dance time with the owner.]

967
00:58:03,322 --> 00:58:06,663
[Hye Jin brimming with excitement.]

968
00:58:07,729 --> 00:58:09,329
[Wasn't I good?]

969
00:58:21,853 --> 00:58:24,393
[After having heard it once,
it sounds very similar!]

970
00:58:24,394 --> 00:58:27,296
- She sang that one part several times.
- Yes, she did.

971
00:58:29,427 --> 00:58:32,297
[An unlimited challenge
at the seafood restaurant?]

972
00:58:33,506 --> 00:58:39,131
[The next dish is a fruity dessert
known as, 'Jjaerayo'.]

973
00:58:40,308 --> 00:58:43,055
[Since the Chef has been disqualified,
it's now between Dong Wook and Jae Suk.]

974
00:58:45,141 --> 00:58:47,629
- How is it?
- It's totally your style.

975
00:58:49,829 --> 00:58:51,305
I bet it'll be unbelievable.

976
00:58:55,090 --> 00:58:56,607
- Stop.
- Already?

977
00:58:58,503 --> 00:59:00,877
What are you going to do?
What if I leave just one?

978
00:59:00,878 --> 00:59:03,023
[You're not really going to eat
28 all at once, are you?]

979
00:59:03,023 --> 00:59:04,318
<i>We still have more show to tape.</i>

980
00:59:06,387 --> 00:59:08,160
I don't think I'll be able to
eat that many.

981
00:59:09,374 --> 00:59:12,672
- Because it's so sweet...
- With a sour after-taste.

982
00:59:14,959 --> 00:59:16,191
Stop.

983
00:59:20,739 --> 00:59:22,675
What are you laughing about now?

984
00:59:24,201 --> 00:59:26,345
[Master of laughter]

985
00:59:27,347 --> 00:59:30,225
[He seems to find their pronunciation
of the word, 'Gae-took' funny.]

986
00:59:30,226 --> 00:59:31,361
Do you find my pronunciation funny?

987
00:59:35,053 --> 00:59:37,555
[Competition with
the dagger hanging on the line.]

988
00:59:38,277 --> 00:59:39,463
Four.

989
00:59:39,464 --> 00:59:41,322
[Inhaling his fourth one.]

990
00:59:42,946 --> 00:59:46,340
He just laughed over Dong Wook saying four
instead of the word, 'Gae-took' this time.

991
00:59:47,657 --> 00:59:48,965
Gae-took.

992
00:59:53,900 --> 00:59:57,242
[Only 12 remaining...
Should I end the game here?]

993
01:00:00,940 --> 01:00:02,344
Stop.

994
01:00:05,867 --> 01:00:07,622
[Unsure of what to do
with only 11 left remaining.]

995
01:00:09,446 --> 01:00:14,409
[The sweet and tart fruit...
can he really eat 10?]

996
01:00:17,210 --> 01:00:19,137
[Eats one first.]

997
01:00:23,654 --> 01:00:24,874
Gae-took.

998
01:00:25,828 --> 01:00:27,003
Gae-took.

999
01:00:30,762 --> 01:00:32,400
Do you like it that much
when they say Gae-took?

1000
01:00:34,009 --> 01:00:36,302
[Seems to be enjoying watching these
two struggling with their decision.]

1001
01:00:42,048 --> 01:00:43,076
One, two, three, four...

1002
01:00:43,261 --> 01:00:45,840
[The person who eats nine of them
will be the winner...]

1003
01:00:55,380 --> 01:00:57,232
[Nine left to go.
Jae Suk starts off by eating one.]

1004
01:00:58,516 --> 01:00:59,784
Gae-took.

1005
01:01:00,803 --> 01:01:01,911
Gae-took.

1006
01:01:01,911 --> 01:01:04,404
[An explosive reaction.]

1007
01:01:07,394 --> 01:01:09,712
[Dong Wook's turn to ponder.]

1008
01:01:20,624 --> 01:01:22,440
[Starting off with one!]

1009
01:01:27,790 --> 01:01:30,236
[Oh... two!]

1010
01:01:30,548 --> 01:01:33,626
Maybe he'll eat all of them.
Keep going, keep going!

1011
01:01:34,481 --> 01:01:35,911
Look at him go!

1012
01:01:38,446 --> 01:01:40,088
Kko-ren, Kko-ren!

1013
01:01:41,105 --> 01:01:42,799
-Kko-ren...
- Kko-ren!

1014
01:01:45,305 --> 01:01:47,011
[Dong Wook seems to be on a warpath.]

1015
01:01:47,011 --> 01:01:48,112
I think this is over!

1016
01:01:48,747 --> 01:01:51,429
Doesn't it feel like it's going to be over?
Kko-ren.

1017
01:01:51,430 --> 01:01:52,757
Finish it.

1018
01:01:52,916 --> 01:01:54,303
Gae-took?

1019
01:01:56,547 --> 01:01:59,173
[Is it going to be Gae-took? Or is it...]

1020
01:02:02,473 --> 01:02:04,698
All the saliva is pooling
in my mouth...

1021
01:02:06,787 --> 01:02:08,547
Okay, I see what you're
made of now.

1022
01:02:08,548 --> 01:02:10,394
[Four left to go for the win.]

1023
01:02:10,395 --> 01:02:12,006
<i>Jae Suk, I think...</i>

1024
01:02:17,909 --> 01:02:20,347
- Kko-ren!
- Kko-ren! Kko-ren!

1025
01:02:21,812 --> 01:02:24,059
[Is it hitting him?]

1026
01:02:25,581 --> 01:02:28,024
- Kko-ren! Kko-ren!
- Kko-ren! Kko-ren!

1027
01:02:28,025 --> 01:02:29,487
Kko-ren?

1028
01:02:30,471 --> 01:02:31,724
Gae-took...

1029
01:02:34,741 --> 01:02:37,111
[Two left for the win.]

1030
01:02:41,025 --> 01:02:43,967
[Will it be 'Kko-ren' or
will it be 'Gae-took'?]

1031
01:02:47,235 --> 01:02:49,470
[Kko-ren...]

1032
01:02:52,133 --> 01:02:53,217
Kko-ren?

1033
01:02:55,299 --> 01:02:56,861
[The tart and sweetness
exploding in his mouth.]

1034
01:02:58,698 --> 01:03:01,952
[Will he really gae-took with
one left to go?]

1035
01:03:01,953 --> 01:03:05,747
<i>Gae-took, Gae-took...</i>

1036
01:03:05,747 --> 01:03:08,979
[What will Dong Wook's decision be?]

1037
01:03:11,958 --> 01:03:13,854
[He goes for his last one...]

1038
01:03:14,702 --> 01:03:16,741
[An explosive reaction.]

1039
01:03:18,177 --> 01:03:22,167
- I can't believe I lost...
- Kko-ren, Kko-ren...

1040
01:03:26,597 --> 01:03:27,896
He ate them all!

1041
01:03:28,423 --> 01:03:30,935
[Only one left remaining.]

1042
01:03:33,172 --> 01:03:34,436
Gae-took.

1043
01:03:36,873 --> 01:03:38,685
[Dong Wook's victory.]

1044
01:03:39,929 --> 01:03:41,275
I'm so disappointed.

1045
01:03:41,276 --> 01:03:43,572
Since this is Gae-took anyway,
I'll give it to Ha Ha.

1046
01:03:43,573 --> 01:03:44,862
- Okay.
- Okay, try it.

1047
01:03:45,581 --> 01:03:46,800
This really is good.

1048
01:03:46,801 --> 01:03:48,885
I feel like I'm about to start tearing up.

1049
01:03:51,923 --> 01:03:53,458
Dong Wook, you did good.

1050
01:03:53,459 --> 01:03:55,563
[Dong Wook's spurt of action.]

1051
01:03:55,564 --> 01:03:57,851
I thought Dong Wook would
only eat one.

1052
01:03:57,852 --> 01:03:59,532
I can't believe he ended
the game like that though.

1053
01:04:00,160 --> 01:04:02,484
[Presents with the dagger.]

1054
01:04:02,485 --> 01:04:03,920
Thank you.

1055
01:04:03,921 --> 01:04:06,559
- Thank you. Thank you so much.
- Okay, thank you.

1056
01:04:11,334 --> 01:04:13,544
- He won his dagger.
- I finally did it.

1057
01:04:13,545 --> 01:04:16,838
[He won the seventh dagger.]

1058
01:04:17,406 --> 01:04:19,110
We have two and they have five.
You don't have any?

1059
01:04:19,110 --> 01:04:20,197
No, we don't have any.

1060
01:04:20,198 --> 01:04:22,686
- Because of Kwang Soo...
- This team needs at least one.

1061
01:04:22,687 --> 01:04:24,443
Thank you.

1062
01:04:25,170 --> 01:04:28,005
[Takes home the eighth dagger.]

1063
01:04:33,624 --> 01:04:37,307
<i>You've got 10 seconds left
to catch Kwang Soo.</i>

1064
01:04:38,026 --> 01:04:41,924
[If he can hold out for another 10 seconds,
Kwang Soo wins for being the fastest.]

1065
01:04:42,874 --> 01:04:44,974
Eight... seven...

1066
01:04:44,975 --> 01:04:46,387
[Kwang Soo being backed up
into the corner.]

1067
01:04:48,832 --> 01:04:50,494
Four...

1068
01:04:54,464 --> 01:04:56,619
[Please...]

1069
01:04:59,958 --> 01:05:01,198
One!

1070
01:05:01,718 --> 01:05:05,174
[With the strength of his height...
he wins!]

1071
01:05:06,933 --> 01:05:08,479
<i>Kwang Soo wins.</i>

1072
01:05:12,101 --> 01:05:14,715
[A fervent reaction from the crowd.]

1073
01:05:16,026 --> 01:05:17,328
A round of applause, please.

1074
01:05:18,109 --> 01:05:20,623
- His height won it for him.
- It's cheating.

1075
01:05:20,624 --> 01:05:22,262
<i>Here is your prize.</i>

1076
01:05:22,866 --> 01:05:26,311
[Tall Kwang Soo wins his dagger.]

1077
01:05:27,187 --> 01:05:31,623
[And here's the ninth dagger.]

1078
01:05:34,343 --> 01:05:35,655
[You did good.]

1079
01:05:38,206 --> 01:05:39,699
Go away!

1080
01:05:41,313 --> 01:05:44,326
[All nine of the daggers are
now found.]

1081
01:05:44,327 --> 01:05:46,167
[Their next destination is...]

1082
01:05:47,085 --> 01:05:49,601
[Hanoi Landmark Tower]

1083
01:05:49,601 --> 01:05:51,541
- Thank you!
- Thank you!

1084
01:05:56,399 --> 01:05:58,111
I wonder who won at the
other locations?

1085
01:05:58,112 --> 01:05:59,837
I feel like the Prince of Asia
would've won his.

1086
01:06:00,336 --> 01:06:02,133
With the energy from the crowd?

1087
01:06:03,266 --> 01:06:04,905
[Right on the money.]

1088
01:06:07,335 --> 01:06:10,421
[A nonstop scream from the fans greet
The Prince of Asia with his newly won dagger.]

1089
01:06:16,186 --> 01:06:20,047
[Gary awed by Running Man TV's celebrity,
Asia's Giraffe, Lee Kwang Soo.]

1090
01:06:20,048 --> 01:06:27,179
There are about three million motorcycles
following Lee Kwang Soo to his next location.

1091
01:06:28,965 --> 01:06:33,914
I've always wanted to come visit Vietnam
ever since I was a little kid.

1092
01:06:34,401 --> 01:06:36,382
- So you've realized your dreams?
- Yes.

1093
01:06:36,700 --> 01:06:39,996
[Giraffe realizes his dreams.]

1094
01:06:41,459 --> 01:06:44,907
<i>Lee Kwang Soo is seriously
stuck in a quandary right now.</i>

1095
01:06:45,117 --> 01:06:48,977
He's wondering if he should be changing
his nationality to Vietnamese...

1096
01:06:48,978 --> 01:06:51,856
- He's thinking very seriously...
- It's only because of Running Man!

1097
01:06:51,857 --> 01:06:55,505
[Even though seeing motorcycles alongside
a car is a common sight in Vietnam...]

1098
01:06:56,104 --> 01:06:58,946
[A sign with Gary's name on it, which
they haven't seen all afternoon.]

1099
01:07:00,964 --> 01:07:04,156
[But as soon as she sees Kwang Soo,
she changes the sign to Kwang Soo's?]

1100
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:12,622
[This is the power of Asia's Giraffe.]

1101
01:07:13,393 --> 01:07:14,894
- Vietnam...
- It's unreal.

1102
01:07:14,894 --> 01:07:19,180
A place where everyone else's sign gets
switched out for Lee Kwang Soo's.

1103
01:07:19,181 --> 01:07:21,819
It really must be an honor.

1104
01:07:21,820 --> 01:07:24,305
Can everyone see what's behind us?

1105
01:07:24,306 --> 01:07:27,844
[Even behind them is a parade
of motorcycles.]

1106
01:07:27,845 --> 01:07:31,336
About 2km behind us right now...

1107
01:07:31,337 --> 01:07:34,686
A parade of motorcycles are trailing
behind us that is about 2km long.

1108
01:07:34,687 --> 01:07:36,169
[Truly a spectacle.]

1109
01:07:38,304 --> 01:07:42,801
We have a staff member here who's been
living in Vietnam for about five years now.

1110
01:07:42,802 --> 01:07:45,469
Have you ever seen anything like this
in Vietnam before?

1111
01:07:46,232 --> 01:07:47,803
- No, I haven't.
- You haven't?

1112
01:07:48,899 --> 01:07:52,077
<i>- Lee Kwang Soo's been turned into an Idol.
- Come on, it's for all of us.</i>

1113
01:07:53,283 --> 01:07:54,808
[Final mission location at last.]

1114
01:07:54,808 --> 01:07:59,210
[The pride of Vietnam-
Hanoi Landmark Tower.]

1115
01:08:02,270 --> 01:08:06,223
[Everywhere they go, they're
greeted by a grateful welcoming.]

1116
01:08:17,086 --> 01:08:19,373
[All the Running Man members start
to arrive at the final location.]

1117
01:08:21,110 --> 01:08:25,404
[The final journey to find the gold dagger.
What kind of a mission will they find here?]

1118
01:08:27,238 --> 01:08:29,178
<i>72nd floor... that's high.</i>

1119
01:08:29,179 --> 01:08:30,918
- Is this it? This building?
- Yeah.

1120
01:08:31,774 --> 01:08:33,528
It was supposedly built by Koreans.

1121
01:08:34,101 --> 01:08:37,378
[Our country's skills, and capitol.
Pride of Vietnam built by Republic of Korea.]

1122
01:08:37,378 --> 01:08:40,606
[At a height of 350m and 72 stories,
it is the tallest building in Indo China.]

1123
01:08:40,606 --> 01:08:43,259
Do you know this?
This building is the tallest in Indo China.

1124
01:08:43,260 --> 01:08:44,747
That's what I just said.

1125
01:08:46,455 --> 01:08:50,009
[Entering the hotel where the chase will
be taking place between 62-72nd floors.]

1126
01:08:52,441 --> 01:08:54,480
- Did you win it?
- Of course, I won it.

1127
01:08:55,309 --> 01:08:58,882
[Most reliable member of the
Yellow Team, Hye Jin.]

1128
01:08:58,883 --> 01:09:00,263
You really are like Joan of Arc.

1129
01:09:00,264 --> 01:09:03,108
[Variety show's Joan of Arc?]

1130
01:09:03,109 --> 01:09:04,480
One, two, three, four!

[To celebrate winning the dagger,
breaks out into a celebratory dance.]

1132
01:09:09,724 --> 01:09:11,421
Koreans built this building.

1133
01:09:11,422 --> 01:09:15,429
Even when you look at it from the
outside, your neck just...

1134
01:09:16,123 --> 01:09:21,443
Lately... the term, 'Blank' that you've been
entitled with seems to be at its peak...

1135
01:09:21,991 --> 01:09:25,305
Jae Suk, my mind has been a little
all over the place today.

1136
01:09:25,306 --> 01:09:27,492
[After traveling all over the place for the
past few days, her mind is a little...]

1137
01:09:27,756 --> 01:09:30,218
- This is insane.
- Its a relief we can't see anything.

1138
01:09:30,219 --> 01:09:33,938
[The roof deck at the top of the building.]

1139
01:09:35,976 --> 01:09:38,739
- Come here.
- Wow... this is so scary.

1140
01:09:38,740 --> 01:09:39,775
[A different sort of fright
from the Macau Tower.]

1141
01:09:40,191 --> 01:09:42,944
Anyway, that aside...
you didn't win a dagger?

1142
01:09:47,666 --> 01:09:50,676
[But they're still the only team
made of all men.]

1143

[Final mission:
Name tag elimination mission.]

1153
01:10:27,811 --> 01:10:29,798
So it's the name tag elimination?

1154
01:10:29,799 --> 01:10:35,997
<i>The team with the final surviving member
is the ultimate winner of the mission.</i>

1155

<i>only the people with the daggers in hand
can participate in the game.</i>

1157

- Wait...

1158
01:10:49,107 --> 01:10:51,114
- What?
- Only those with daggers can participate?

1159
01:10:51,115 --> 01:10:52,435

two daggers within their team...</i>

1161

<i>Only two members of the team can
participate in the name tag elimination.</i>

1162

can trade their daggers in for are two.]

1170
01:11:32,218 --> 01:11:34,537
Five... I bet those guys are happy.

1171
01:11:34,538 --> 01:11:35,962
<i>And, one more thing...</i>

1172
01:11:35,963 --> 01:11:40,202
<i>Hidden throughout this place...
are shields.</i>

1173
01:11:40,203 --> 01:11:41,901
[There are shields
hidden throughout the place.]

1174
01:11:41,901 --> 01:11:44,231
<i>If you find one of these shields...</i>

1175
01:11:44,232 --> 01:11:48,797
<i>figure out how to use them,
and we hope that you use them wisely.</i>

1176
01:11:48,798 --> 01:11:52,206
In this case, since the other team has
five daggers, all of them can participate.

1177
01:11:52,498 --> 01:11:55,190
And two of them are going
to have two lives.

1178
01:11:56,154 --> 01:11:58,263
- We'll give Hye Jin two...
- We'll give her two.

1179
01:11:58,741 --> 01:12:00,287
And you can have two.

1180
01:12:00,876 --> 01:12:05,668
I think people are going to think that
I'm going to be one with two lives.

1181
01:12:06,847 --> 01:12:08,281
- I understand.
- In that case...

1182
01:12:08,758 --> 01:12:10,633
- I'll go in.
- To jail?

1183
01:12:11,096 --> 01:12:15,262
Since... since I'm a little injured...

1184
01:12:15,551 --> 01:12:18,651
- No, Jong Kook. I'll go in.
- Kwang Soo, get your head on straight!

1185
01:12:18,942 --> 01:12:20,276
Kwang Soo...

1186
01:12:20,277 --> 01:12:22,345
- Get your head on straight. I'll go in.
- No.

1187
01:12:22,346 --> 01:12:26,377
[Is this an act? Why are they
all of a sudden acting loyal?]

1188
01:12:26,378 --> 01:12:27,551
Don't be like this.

1189
01:12:27,552 --> 01:12:29,103
This is boring.

1190
01:12:29,104 --> 01:12:30,661
You have to remain strong, Kwang Soo.

1191
01:12:31,043 --> 01:12:34,130
[Since they're both volunteering to go,
I'm not going to stop them.]

1192
01:12:34,361 --> 01:12:36,844
<i>Kwang Soo, you have to remain strong.</i>

1193
01:12:36,844 --> 01:12:39,922
This is said to be the tallest building
in Indo China.

1194
01:12:41,456 --> 01:12:45,409
You and I will be able to work together
again in the future. Kwang Soo...

1195
01:12:46,708 --> 01:12:49,898
So I guess I'm going to get to participate?
Seeing how those two are right now?

1196
01:12:51,092 --> 01:12:52,760
Okay, I'm in.

1197
01:12:52,761 --> 01:12:55,570
Somehow... somehow, I'll find a way!

1198
01:12:55,571 --> 01:12:58,578
Find a way somehow,
and bring me in later on.

1199
01:12:58,579 --> 01:13:00,338
I understand.
Just wait a little while.

1200
01:13:00,338 --> 01:13:02,587
[I'm so bored...]

1201
01:13:02,588 --> 01:13:03,772
<i>I'll put my life on the line to find a way.</i>

1202
01:13:03,773 --> 01:13:05,224
<i>- Okay, Kwang Soo.
- Jong Kook!</i>

1203
01:13:05,225 --> 01:13:06,539
Kwang Soo!

1204
01:13:07,084 --> 01:13:10,092
[Beautiful...]

1205
01:13:12,982 --> 01:13:14,958
[Just go on to jail...]

1206
01:13:15,865 --> 01:13:17,788
Do you really have to do it like this?

1207
01:13:17,789 --> 01:13:19,294
- This is really...
- This is so cruel.

1208
01:13:20,378 --> 01:13:22,922
Hurry up and go, Suk Jin.
We have to get on with the show.

1209
01:13:23,286 --> 01:13:26,271
- You guys have to make sure to win, okay?
- Of course.

1210
01:13:26,272 --> 01:13:28,715
[Only two daggers. Ji Hyo and
Jae Suk are the only participants]

1211
01:13:29,070 --> 01:13:30,421
<i>One more thing.</i>

1212
01:13:30,422 --> 01:13:34,918
<i>If the two of you are caught together
by the protectors of the daggers...</i>

1213
01:13:35,146 --> 01:13:37,075
<i>you're going to be separated
right away.</i>

1214
01:13:37,075 --> 01:13:39,684
- They can even eliminate your name tag.
- I understand.

1215
01:13:40,179 --> 01:13:41,825
Stay sharp and survive this, okay?

1216
01:13:41,826 --> 01:13:42,887
- Let's stay sharp.
- Okay.

1217
01:13:43,051 --> 01:13:49,129
[For the teams that are short on men,
finding the shield is their priority!]

1218
01:13:56,395 --> 01:13:58,017
[Who will be the ultimate victor
of the nine daggers?]

1219
01:13:58,017 --> 01:14:00,022
[Mission - start!]

1220
01:14:03,291 --> 01:14:05,167
We can see everything from here.

1221
01:14:05,653 --> 01:14:08,756
[An easy way to see everything thanks to
an open floor plan on the guests' floors.]

1222
01:14:09,813 --> 01:14:11,632
Find the shield.

1223
01:14:11,633 --> 01:14:14,178
[Green Team's Ji Hyo is on the search
up on the observation deck.]

1224
01:14:15,710 --> 01:14:17,887
The clouds are coming my way!

1225
01:14:18,360 --> 01:14:20,362
Look! It's the clouds!

1226
01:14:22,799 --> 01:14:25,676
[The clouds really are
right in front of her eyes!]

1227
01:14:30,600 --> 01:14:33,871
This means that we're up high
in the clouds right now!

1228
01:14:35,352 --> 01:14:37,738
[But...]

1229
01:14:37,738 --> 01:14:40,926
[Aren't you scared at all?]

1230
01:14:43,174 --> 01:14:48,174
[On the other hand,
Yellow Team with their two extra lives.]

1231
01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:51,749
There... I see it, I see it.

1232
01:14:57,390 --> 01:14:58,732
Over there, over there.

1233
01:14:59,315 --> 01:15:01,137
I can see him over there.

1234
01:15:08,568 --> 01:15:10,829
[Making her approach slowly
as if she really is the Joan of Arc.]

1235
01:15:13,826 --> 01:15:16,148
[Discovers each other!]

1236
01:15:17,373 --> 01:15:20,346
[Yellow Team's Hye Jin vs.
Blue Team's Dong Wook!]

1237
01:15:20,347 --> 01:15:22,664
[Yellow Team's first life in danger!]

1238
01:15:22,664 --> 01:15:24,278
Hey!
Be careful!

1239
01:15:26,936 --> 01:15:29,564
[Kwang Soo takes off to help Dong Wook
after hearing all the shouting.]

1240
01:15:37,773 --> 01:15:40,769
[Hye Jin lying down to stick her back
down on the floor.]

1241
01:15:41,510 --> 01:15:44,677
[If anything, it's the two men who are
struggling against her.]

1242
01:15:44,820 --> 01:15:46,363
Ha Ha!

1243
01:15:48,240 --> 01:15:51,152
[Starts to attack her way through!]

1244
01:15:53,973 --> 01:15:57,867
[After figuring out which floor she's on...
he's off!]

1245
01:15:59,239 --> 01:16:00,483
Ha Ha!

1246
01:16:05,881 --> 01:16:08,892
[Hye Jin uses her legs to attack Kwang Soo!]

1247
01:16:10,181 --> 01:16:12,715
[What a spectacle...]

1248
01:16:13,925 --> 01:16:15,028
No, no!

1249
01:16:15,873 --> 01:16:17,005
Rip it off!
Rip off her tag!

1250
01:16:17,006 --> 01:16:18,355
Hurry up and rip it off!

1251
01:16:19,236 --> 01:16:20,451
Hurry up and rip it off!

1252
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:26,646
[Yellow Team's Hye Jin...
Loses one of her two name tags.]

1253
01:16:28,432 --> 01:16:29,563
I'm sorry. Sorry.

1254
01:16:32,087 --> 01:16:35,758
[Gary arrives one step too late.]

1255
01:16:35,758 --> 01:16:37,068
- They ripped it off.
- You got ripped off?

1256
01:16:37,069 --> 01:16:40,101
- By whom?
- Kwang Soo... and Dong Wook!

1257
01:16:40,227 --> 01:16:43,104
I told you! Kwang Soo
doesn't care if you're a girl!

1258
01:16:43,104 --> 01:16:45,974
Seriously... I didn't take Kwang Soo
to be like that, but really...

1259
01:16:46,732 --> 01:16:51,266
[Yellow Team's name tag count-
Hye Jin:1, Ha Ha:2, Gary:1.]

1260
01:16:52,223 --> 01:16:54,869
- I should call him on the transmitter.
- That I'm on my last one.

1261
01:16:54,870 --> 01:16:56,778
[Hye Jin attaches her last
name tag on her back.]

1262
01:16:58,085 --> 01:17:01,041
I think I need to tie my hair back.
A ton of my hair got ripped out.

1263
01:17:03,107 --> 01:17:06,361
[Fine, no more nice girl...]

1264
01:17:07,556 --> 01:17:11,869
[Blue Team taking a sigh of relief
after eliminating one name tag.]

1265
01:17:13,690 --> 01:17:15,965
Hye Jin... she's really strong.

1266
01:17:19,002 --> 01:17:23,279
[But Yellow Team still has the most advantages!
Must continue their attack...]

1267
01:17:26,033 --> 01:17:27,375
It's Dong Wook!

1268
01:17:27,376 --> 01:17:30,630
[Discovers Ha Ha from the Yellow Team!
Starts his chase!]

1269
01:17:37,267 --> 01:17:41,593
[Green Team's Jae Suk discovers Ha Ha
from having been on the same floor!]

1270
01:17:42,865 --> 01:17:46,535
[The Blue Team and Green Team succeeds
with the ambush attack!]

1271
01:17:48,666 --> 01:17:50,375
[Dong Wook starts to run
without any hesitation!]

1272
01:17:52,468 --> 01:17:53,774
He has two lives!

1273
01:17:56,535 --> 01:17:59,315
[Eliminates Yellow Team Ha Ha's name tag.]

1274
01:17:59,316 --> 01:18:00,865
Working together like that...

1275
01:18:02,058 --> 01:18:06,647
[Yellow Team's Ha Ha
loses one of his two lives.]

1276
01:18:08,813 --> 01:18:10,335
I'm mad.

1277
01:18:10,856 --> 01:18:12,795
Do you know that they
attacked me together?

1278
01:18:12,796 --> 01:18:14,129
They're working together.

1279
01:18:16,029 --> 01:18:19,543
[The targeted Yellow Team
plans their counterattack!]

1280
01:18:21,127 --> 01:18:27,892
[Having lost all their extra lives,
it's now onto the real face-off!]

1281
01:18:35,659 --> 01:18:39,820
[Dong Wook attacks Ha Ha again
after having followed him!]

1282
01:18:40,804 --> 01:18:43,891
[If Ha Ha's name tag gets ripped off again,
he'll be ousted for good!]

1283
01:18:43,891 --> 01:18:47,315
[Seriously attacking each other.]

1284
01:18:50,169 --> 01:18:51,568
You can't bite me.

1285
01:18:53,829 --> 01:18:56,711
[A real battle without any mercy!]

1286
01:19:00,632 --> 01:19:01,894
My hair, my hair!

1287
01:19:04,542 --> 01:19:09,557
[Dong Wook eliminates
Ha Ha's name tag first!]

1288
01:19:12,450 --> 01:19:17,530
[Yellow Team's Ha Ha loses both his lives
that he traded in his daggers for!]

1289
01:19:24,865 --> 01:19:27,327
<i>[Ha Ha, Out!
Ha Ha, Out!]</i>

1290
01:19:27,327 --> 01:19:31,041
[At last? The Yellow Team
loses a team member.]

1291
01:19:33,255 --> 01:19:36,144
[We had the biggest advantage...]

1292
01:19:36,144 --> 01:19:39,737
[You just wait and see!]

1293
01:19:39,737 --> 01:19:43,440
[Once in a while Mr. Capable Kang Gary...
focused and determined!]

1294
01:19:49,592 --> 01:19:53,093
[Discovers Kwang Soo
entering a room just then.]

1295
01:19:57,004 --> 01:20:00,838
[Approaches the door of the room
Kwang Soo just entered.]

1296
01:20:03,736 --> 01:20:06,568
[Hye Jin also heads in the same direction...]

1297
01:20:06,568 --> 01:20:08,933
- Where is he?
- I think he's in there.

1298
01:20:13,197 --> 01:20:15,669
[Discovers Kwang Soo!]

1299
01:20:17,097 --> 01:20:20,442
[Instead of backing down,
Kwang Soo comes out attacking Gary!]

1300
01:20:20,442 --> 01:20:23,395
[No matter who it is,
one of them is going to get ousted!]

1301
01:20:23,395 --> 01:20:26,026
[Today's battles becoming more fierce
than any other previous battles!]

1302
01:20:26,027 --> 01:20:28,040
I'm about to get eliminated!

1303
01:20:28,741 --> 01:20:30,057
Lee Kwang Soo, out!

1304
01:20:30,058 --> 01:20:33,005
[Eliminates Kwang Soo's
name tag in its entirety!]

1305
01:20:33,880 --> 01:20:35,063
Wait...

1306
01:20:35,481 --> 01:20:37,698
How is she going to survive on her own
if I get eliminated?

1307
01:20:37,699 --> 01:20:40,446
- I would be so frightened...
- I know.

1308
01:20:41,798 --> 01:20:45,546
<i>With his long arms...
I saw Kwang Soo's facial expression.</i>

1309
01:20:45,547 --> 01:20:47,476
<i>He looked like he was about to kill me!</i>

1310
01:20:47,476 --> 01:20:49,570
[Blue Team Kwang Soo's
name tag eliminated!]

1311
01:20:51,492 --> 01:20:52,772
Kwang Soo!

1312
01:20:53,541 --> 01:20:54,812
Kwang Soo!

1313
01:20:55,628 --> 01:20:57,888
I think I call you more than
I call my own mom.

1314
01:20:57,888 --> 01:21:01,241
<i>[Lee Kwang Soo, out!
Lee Kwang Soo, out!]</i>

1315
01:21:06,323 --> 01:21:10,207
[I'm the only one left on my team?]

1316
01:21:11,907 --> 01:21:13,080
I need to escape for now.

1317
01:21:13,081 --> 01:21:15,697
[If he's caught, he's dead!
Going into hiding for now...]

1318
01:21:17,207 --> 01:21:19,759
[He's at a disadvantage!]

1319
01:21:19,760 --> 01:21:22,449
[Finding the shield has to
be the solution...]

1320
01:21:24,067 --> 01:21:28,893
[Both teams shocked by Gary's counterattack
concentrate on finding the shield!]

1321
01:21:31,979 --> 01:21:37,434
[Hoping to bring the victory closer
by finding the mysterious shield!]

1322
01:21:38,961 --> 01:21:40,846
Why are they all already open?

1323
01:21:40,847 --> 01:21:42,732
All the rooms are already open!

1324
01:21:44,394 --> 01:21:48,077
[But detailed Dong Wook
still goes on with his search.]

1325
01:21:48,077 --> 01:21:49,620
Did I go in there already?

1326
01:21:50,444 --> 01:21:52,684
So this is what Running Man
does to you...

1327
01:21:53,072 --> 01:21:54,423
It turns you into an idiot.

1328
01:21:55,453 --> 01:21:57,376
What floors was I on?

1329
01:21:58,764 --> 01:22:00,330
Where was I?

1330
01:22:03,246 --> 01:22:06,035
[The shield!]

1331
01:22:06,035 --> 01:22:09,902
[Blue Team's Dong Wook
discovers a shield!]

1332
01:22:11,755 --> 01:22:14,441
[Was told to read the instructions carefully
if he were to find one...]

1333
01:22:14,959 --> 01:22:17,052
<i>[Can oust the person
who ripped off your name tag.]</i>

1334
01:22:17,052 --> 01:22:18,679
<i>[Or resurrect a member of
your team.]</i>

1335
01:22:18,680 --> 01:22:21,465
<i>[Choose one of the two options.]</i>

1336
01:22:22,927 --> 01:22:24,281
[Should he use it as a reflector
to protect himself...]

1337
01:22:24,281 --> 01:22:29,554
[Or bring in a comrade by
resurrecting one of his team members?]

1338
01:22:29,554 --> 01:22:34,263
[Two members on each of the other teams,
while he's the only one left on his team!]

1339
01:22:36,886 --> 01:22:38,668
I'm going to summon Mr. Capable.

1340
01:22:38,668 --> 01:22:40,402
I'm going to summon Mr. Capable.

1341
01:22:40,730 --> 01:22:42,480
[Dong Wook chooses to use
the shield for resurrection!]

1342
01:22:43,846 --> 01:22:48,145
[The second power of the shield-
Resurrect a team member!]

1343
01:22:50,148 --> 01:22:52,219
<i>A shield has been discovered.</i>

1344
01:22:52,749 --> 01:22:55,927
- A shield has been discovered.
- Someone found a shield.

1345
01:22:56,300 --> 01:22:57,812
- Who did it?
- Who found a shield?

1346
01:22:58,454 --> 01:23:01,672
- Was it one of ours?
- In the name of the shield holder...

1347
01:23:02,982 --> 01:23:04,870
<i>Kim Jong Kook has been resurrected.</i>

1348
01:23:05,786 --> 01:23:09,500
[Blue Team's Mr. Capable,
Kim Jong Kook is resurrected!]

1349
01:23:10,232 --> 01:23:11,637
<i>Kim Jong Kook is resurrected!</i>

1350
01:23:15,184 --> 01:23:16,628
Kim Jong Kook is resurrected?

1351
01:23:17,820 --> 01:23:21,402
[Like a bolt of lightning to the
remaining survivors...]

1352
01:23:21,402 --> 01:23:22,848
I'm seriously about to go insane!

1353
01:23:22,849 --> 01:23:24,586
You can't do this!

1354
01:23:25,406 --> 01:23:28,778
[The flow of victory
being shaken from the core.]

1355
01:23:29,569 --> 01:23:31,324
<i>If you can find one more shield,
it's all over!</i>

1356
01:23:33,028 --> 01:23:35,142
I think I'm going to go with speed.

1357
01:23:35,143 --> 01:23:37,591
I'll just rip off all the name tags.

1358
01:23:37,592 --> 01:23:42,531
[Will the once doomed Blue Team
be able to take their victory now?]

1359
01:23:43,567 --> 01:23:46,298
The tiger is finally going to get unleashed
to come after us.

1360
01:23:46,299 --> 01:23:47,791
Ji Hyo, we're in big trouble.

1361
01:23:52,696 --> 01:23:58,062
[Yellow Team, Blue Team, and Green Team
each left with two survivors.]

1362
01:23:58,661 --> 01:24:01,367
[Yoo-ruce Willis makes his way towards jail.]

1363
01:24:03,123 --> 01:24:05,760
Too late... you're too late.

1364
01:24:05,761 --> 01:24:07,629
Who are you trying to contact?

1365
01:24:09,439 --> 01:24:13,199
[Yellow Team's Gary fixed on
Jae Suk as his target.]

1366
01:24:15,188 --> 01:24:18,248
[The recently targeted Yellow Team
starts their counterattack!]

1367
01:24:18,249 --> 01:24:22,345
[Hye Jin starts her approach first!]

1368
01:24:24,217 --> 01:24:26,411
[And Gary closes in from the other end!]

1369
01:24:28,629 --> 01:24:30,405
- Where are you? Where are you?
- Right here!

1370
01:24:32,444 --> 01:24:34,974
[Yoo-ruce Willis barely breaks through
their ambush attack!]

1371
01:24:35,989 --> 01:24:39,170
[All three facing off in the lobby!]

1372
01:24:40,154 --> 01:24:43,766
[Yellow Team targets Jae Suk!]

1373
01:24:44,798 --> 01:24:49,115
[Jae Suk eliminates Hye Jin in a flash!]

1374
01:24:51,176 --> 01:24:55,074
[Yellow Team's Hye Jin
loses all her lives!]

1375
01:24:56,502 --> 01:24:58,959
<i>[Han Hye Jin, out!
Han Hye Jin, out!]</i>

1376
01:24:59,717 --> 01:25:02,848
[In the midst of her attack,
gets counterattacked instead...]

1377
01:25:05,226 --> 01:25:08,092
[Ji Hyo arrives one step behind
the action.]

1378
01:25:08,093 --> 01:25:12,531
[Green Team's Jae Suk and Ji Hyo
vs. Yellow Team's Gary!]

1379
01:25:13,453 --> 01:25:14,486
We have to get Gary.

1380
01:25:15,104 --> 01:25:18,102
[If Gary gets ousted,
Yellow Team is destroyed!]

1381
01:25:19,492 --> 01:25:22,203
[A bloody hand-to-hand combat!]

1382
01:25:27,685 --> 01:25:30,575
[Gary eliminates Green Team's Jae Suk!]

1383
01:25:31,125 --> 01:25:34,348
[Green Team's Jae Suk loses his life!]

1384
01:25:38,171 --> 01:25:41,961
This is starting to go our way,
Dong Wook.

1385
01:25:43,146 --> 01:25:46,511
[The victory can easily become ours!]

1386
01:25:53,337 --> 01:25:56,209
Ji Hyo, you have to
think very carefully about this.

1387
01:25:56,608 --> 01:25:59,357
Jong Kook and Dong Wook
are still left alive.

1388
01:25:59,881 --> 01:26:04,318
Until we can oust one of them...
Promise. Let's promise each other.

1389
01:26:04,319 --> 01:26:06,120
[Must oust one of the Blue Team
members together!]

1390
01:26:06,488 --> 01:26:07,565
They're watching us.

1391
01:26:08,074 --> 01:26:09,967
- What are they doing?
- They saw us making the promise.

1392
01:26:12,067 --> 01:26:13,525
Are you guys holding hands?

1393
01:26:13,526 --> 01:26:16,607
We just promised each other that
we'd go grab dinner together.

1394
01:26:17,172 --> 01:26:19,365
[What a joke of an excuse...]

1395
01:26:19,365 --> 01:26:22,262
- We just said we'd grab dinner later.
- I know that.

1396
01:26:22,263 --> 01:26:25,468
We just said we'd grab dinner together.
We're having dinner together later.

1397
01:26:25,601 --> 01:26:28,247
How is it Jong Kook would see us
right at that moment?

1398
01:26:28,248 --> 01:26:31,050
We were just promising each other to
have dinner later, right?

1399
01:26:31,050 --> 01:26:34,564
- I think the protectors are going to come.
- Okay, let's separate for now.

1400
01:26:34,564 --> 01:26:37,856
- He coming. Gary, he's coming.
- Be careful. Don't go in his direction.

1401
01:26:38,455 --> 01:26:41,936
[The Green and Yellow Team
agree on working together for now!]

1402
01:26:42,448 --> 01:26:44,220
<i>We have no other choice
in this situation.</i>

1403
01:26:44,221 --> 01:26:49,468
[At a disadvantage in strength!
Must find the shield...]

1404
01:26:53,797 --> 01:26:56,018
If I can't find a shield...

1405
01:26:56,019 --> 01:26:59,395
[Must find a shield to get the
victory leaning back towards his side!]

1406
01:27:01,011 --> 01:27:06,047
[Green Team's Blank Ji is searching for
the shield with the same thought in mind.]

1407
01:27:12,787 --> 01:27:14,885
[Everyone else in jail is starting
to cheer on their team mate.]

1408
01:27:14,886 --> 01:27:16,324
Dong Wook is really good too.

1409
01:27:16,325 --> 01:27:20,825
[Hye Jin having been surprised by
Dong Wook's skills earlier.]

1410
01:27:20,825 --> 01:27:22,453
I got my hair pulled.

1411
01:27:23,045 --> 01:27:24,855
- Dong Wook did it.
- Really?

1412
01:27:27,756 --> 01:27:29,557
<i>A shield has been discovered.</i>

1413
01:27:30,330 --> 01:27:31,942
<i>A shield has been discovered.</i>

1414
01:27:31,942 --> 01:27:33,939
So there was more than one shield?

1415
01:27:33,940 --> 01:27:37,515
[Someone else discovered a shield?]

1416
01:27:37,515 --> 01:27:40,437
[This is big trouble...]

1417
01:27:45,219 --> 01:27:47,362
I guess they're not going to
announce anything.

1418
01:27:47,363 --> 01:27:48,957
No announcements about the shield?

1419
01:27:48,958 --> 01:27:53,387
[Kim Jong Kook's resurrection was announced,
but why no announcements this time?]

1420
01:28:00,310 --> 01:28:01,684
[Now that he thinks about it...]

1421
01:28:01,684 --> 01:28:05,002
[There was the ability to reflect too!]

1422
01:28:06,028 --> 01:28:10,304
The shield could be used for something
else other than resurrect someone.

1423
01:28:10,305 --> 01:28:14,426
It could mean an extra life for someone,
or it could be used as a reflector.

1424
01:28:14,427 --> 01:28:15,856
[Precise deduction from experience?]

1425
01:28:15,856 --> 01:28:17,987
Jong Kook, I know this much from having
found the shield myself...

1426
01:28:17,988 --> 01:28:20,056
and you're right.
There's the reflector power.

1427
01:28:20,057 --> 01:28:21,346
See? I knew it.

1428
01:28:21,346 --> 01:28:24,528
It's not necessarily about resurrection,
but it could be a reflector too.

1429
01:28:25,415 --> 01:28:27,676
I feel like it's Ji Hyo for some reason.

1430
01:28:28,729 --> 01:28:31,836
Then what should we do?
Should I eliminate Ji Hyo?

1431
01:28:34,179 --> 01:28:38,251
[Which one of the two found the shield?]

1432
01:28:38,251 --> 01:28:39,524
- Did you find the shield?
- No.

1433
01:28:40,089 --> 01:28:43,972
[They're both denying it was them...]

1434
01:28:44,651 --> 01:28:46,149
You didn't find the shield?

1435
01:28:46,150 --> 01:28:48,846
You were so good at acting for a while,
but what happened?

1436
01:28:48,847 --> 01:28:50,328
What acting?

1437
01:28:51,531 --> 01:28:56,085
[Just from their facial expressions,
it's hard to guess who has the shield...]

1438
01:29:03,533 --> 01:29:05,884
- From the back.
- Dong Wook is going in!

1439
01:29:05,885 --> 01:29:07,669
[A live broadcast segment.]

1440
01:29:07,670 --> 01:29:09,660
- Dong Wook is going in.
- Dong Wook! Be careful.

1441
01:29:10,273 --> 01:29:11,964
Where?
Where is he?

1442
01:29:11,965 --> 01:29:15,137
[Dong Wook vs. Gary and Ji Hyo]

1443
01:29:15,137 --> 01:29:17,895
[Imminent face-off]

1444
01:29:18,243 --> 01:29:19,824
Who found the shield?

1445
01:29:19,825 --> 01:29:21,836
- Seriously, who found the shield?
- I don't know. I honestly have no idea.

1446
01:29:23,242 --> 01:29:24,632
[No Mr. Capable in sight...]

1447
01:29:24,632 --> 01:29:29,486
[In that case, Dong Wook...]

1448
01:29:29,486 --> 01:29:31,032
You're trying to eliminate me right now?

1449
01:29:32,092 --> 01:29:33,568
Jong Kook!

1450
01:29:37,288 --> 01:29:40,116
[Did something happen out here?]

1451
01:29:41,688 --> 01:29:42,996
Where the heck is this guy?

1452
01:29:42,996 --> 01:29:44,575
He hasn't been any help
since I brought him to life!

1453
01:29:44,576 --> 01:29:46,458
That's why you should've
resurrected me.

1454
01:29:46,459 --> 01:29:49,099
[Come on, that's a little...]

1455
01:29:50,118 --> 01:29:53,718
[Gary is on the ball today!
A face-to-face battle with Dong Wook!]

1456
01:29:54,138 --> 01:29:56,422
[Mr. Capable seeing an opportunity
to attack!]

1457
01:29:58,845 --> 01:30:01,430
[Blue Team's Dong Wook in danger!]

1458
01:30:01,903 --> 01:30:04,073
[Combo play!
Each grabbing one of his arms!]

1459
01:30:11,890 --> 01:30:14,633
[Gary eliminates Dong Wook's name tag!]

1460
01:30:16,051 --> 01:30:19,387
[Ah... misses it by a beat.]

1461
01:30:19,387 --> 01:30:21,575
[Dong Wook - Out!]

1462
01:30:22,151 --> 01:30:23,323
<i>You're ousted?</i>

1463
01:30:23,324 --> 01:30:25,475
[Gary is the real killer today!]

1464
01:30:29,533 --> 01:30:32,417
[Gary immediately follows it up
by eliminating Ji Hyo!]

1465
01:30:32,417 --> 01:30:34,643
[Nothing on her back!]

1466
01:30:36,165 --> 01:30:41,365
[That means the person who found
the shield was...]

1467
01:30:41,365 --> 01:30:44,505
[Gary!]

1468
01:30:45,938 --> 01:30:51,024
[Gary having searched through
the restaurant earlier...]

1469
01:30:51,024 --> 01:30:53,163
[Discovers a shield!]

1470
01:30:55,239 --> 01:30:57,551
[What luck for Yellow Team's Gary!]

1471
01:30:59,589 --> 01:31:02,845
Can oust the member who rips off
the name tag... reflector!

1472
01:31:03,555 --> 01:31:06,870
One option is to resurrect
one of the team members.

1473
01:31:07,299 --> 01:31:10,968
[Gary's choice is...]

1474
01:31:10,968 --> 01:31:16,420
[Reflect!]

1475
01:31:19,175 --> 01:31:22,034
[Try your best to eliminate me...]

1476
01:31:23,365 --> 01:31:27,508
[Gary has the reflector...]

1477
01:31:28,831 --> 01:31:31,702
- Remember when you got resurrected?
- Hi, Gary!

1478
01:31:31,703 --> 01:31:34,734
Remember how you were resurrected?

1479
01:31:34,735 --> 01:31:35,822
[If he's ripped off, he wins.
If he rips off, he still wins.]

1480
01:31:35,823 --> 01:31:37,705
Why don't you get out there?

1481
01:31:37,706 --> 01:31:40,145
[Our team is ruined...]

1482
01:31:40,438 --> 01:31:43,105
Don't push yourself when your foot is hurt,
and just step over this way.

1483
01:31:43,106 --> 01:31:45,425
[This is what you call
a slap in the back of the head.]

1484
01:31:45,426 --> 01:31:47,603
You know very well what this is.

1485
01:31:48,023 --> 01:31:51,105
Or you could just try ripping mine off!

1486
01:31:52,461 --> 01:31:55,183
- I know...
- Jong Kook, just rip it off!

1487
01:31:56,054 --> 01:31:57,978
[Can't do this... or that...]

1488
01:31:57,979 --> 01:32:01,370
- You know exactly what this is!
- Great job! Great job!

1489
01:32:05,049 --> 01:32:07,229
Besieged!
Besieged!

1490
01:32:08,596 --> 01:32:12,216
[Fine! If you want it, then I'll rip it off!]

1491
01:32:16,356 --> 01:32:19,680
[Shield activated! Reflect!
Jong Kook, out!]

1492
01:32:24,389 --> 01:32:28,446
[The ultimate victor for having gathered
all the swords together, Yellow Team!]

1493
01:32:32,894 --> 01:32:37,986
[At last, to where the golden dagger
awaits in its slumber...]
