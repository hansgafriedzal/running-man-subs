00:00:41,433 --> 00:00:45,707
See? This is why I said it's not good for me
to stand next to you during the opening.

13
00:00:45,708 --> 00:00:48,263
I'm immediately subjugated as a foolish idiot
because I'm standing next to Kwang Soo.

14

15
00:00:50,256 --> 00:00:52,399
- You really think this is because of me?
- I'm even wearing green because of you!

16
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:55,273
When you ask an idiot to be an idiot,
it can be very insulting.

17
00:00:55,274 --> 00:00:57,779
You're not supposed to tell
an ugly person that he's ugly.

18
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:00,997
- But being idiots doesn't really suit us.
- That's what I'm saying.

19
00:01:00,998 --> 00:01:02,255

called them idiots...

37
00:02:05,822 --> 00:02:06,845
Idiots...

38

[Maybe even her ears have
gained weight...]

- What were you again?

76
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:17,121
- I'm just blank...
- Because you're always spaced out?

77
00:04:17,122 --> 00:04:18,857
Snap out of it and
get yourself together.

78
00:04:19,838 --> 00:04:21,504
- What about you?
- Because I'm pretty...

79

00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,469
Really? Is that what he said?
But we're not idiots.

174
00:09:28,989 --> 00:09:30,664
[They're not?]

175
00:09:30,665 --> 00:09:32,612
- It's been awhile.
- I wish we were marrying you.

176
00:09:32,613 --> 00:09:36,705
Finally at this age...
I finally get to play the role of a princess.

177
00:09:36,706 --> 00:09:37,968
It's making me feel really happy.

178
00:09:37,968 --> 00:09:40,313
And just this past summer,
you played the role of a tuna.

179
00:09:40,313 --> 00:09:42,140
[A recent summer tuna...]

180
00:09:42,771 --> 00:09:45,467
- I lost some weight since then.
- You have?

181
00:09:45,468 --> 00:09:46,588
[After her fishing incident,
she's lost some weight.]

182
00:09:46,824 --> 00:09:49,139
- I'm serious.
- Your clothes seem a bit loose.

183
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:50,744
I purposely wore something bigger.

184
00:09:53,069 --> 00:09:55,607
[Just leave?]

185
00:09:58,456 --> 00:09:59,818
- Are you leaving?
- Yeah.

186
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:02,680
In that case,
we'll see you in a little bit.

187
00:10:02,681 --> 00:10:04,866
[A cool farewell?]

188
00:10:04,866 --> 00:10:06,186
Want to come with me?

189
00:10:07,212 --> 00:10:08,295
[Will Sa Yeon be deterred
this easily?]

190
00:10:08,295 --> 00:10:09,660
Sa Yeon, I think they're okay.

191
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:12,616
We have something to talk
to Ji Hyo about.

192
00:10:13,526 --> 00:10:17,518
If you're going to do something like this,
pick someone with better brains.

193
00:10:17,518 --> 00:10:19,403
I doubt Kwang Soo is it.

194
00:10:21,826 --> 00:10:24,096
[His explosive idiot act.]

195
00:10:24,097 --> 00:10:27,602
- In that case... I'll just come back later.
- Okay, then we'll see you later.

196
00:10:27,998 --> 00:10:29,313
Goodbye, Sa Yeon.

197
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:33,839
[Safely... passes on Princess Sa Yeon?]

198
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:39,004
[Whew...]

199
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,823
I knew that was going to happen.

200
00:10:41,647 --> 00:10:45,836
Whenever there's a race involving
queens or princesses...

201
00:10:45,836 --> 00:10:47,739
it's pretty much a given
that Sa Yeon will be on the show.

202
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:49,717
[Blank...]

203
00:10:52,262 --> 00:10:55,061
[Idiot Gary and idiot Ro-Ro
infatuated with playing their idiot roles.]

204
00:10:55,387 --> 00:10:56,819
Come here!

205
00:10:57,506 --> 00:10:59,203
Dried persimmon, you come here!

206
00:11:02,534 --> 00:11:04,256
Give me back my dried persimmon!

207
00:11:05,183 --> 00:11:06,244
Hey!

208
00:11:06,727 --> 00:11:08,265
Hey, my dried persimmon!

209
00:11:09,751 --> 00:11:13,324
[Where are all the idiots?]

210
00:11:13,324 --> 00:11:18,558
[I have to meet an idiot and turn him into
the ultimate general of Running Kingdom.]

211
00:11:18,559 --> 00:11:20,540
<i>Meet yourselves a foolish idiot...</i>

212
00:11:20,541 --> 00:11:23,221
<i>and turn them into the ultimate general
in all of Running Kingdom.</i>

213
00:11:23,222 --> 00:11:24,971
<i>Then I will forgive you.</i>

214
00:11:24,972 --> 00:11:28,845
- Sa Yeon... you didn't even eat that much.
- That's what I'm saying.

215
00:11:28,846 --> 00:11:30,026
Father is so weird.

216
00:11:30,027 --> 00:11:33,563
Just because I was born weighing 4.8kg,
he keeps holding that against me.

217
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:38,168
- And you've lost all that weight recently.
- I know, I'm nothing but a bag of bones now.

218
00:11:38,169 --> 00:11:40,693
What do we do?
Our father really is...

219
00:11:42,379 --> 00:11:43,391
Look who's here!

220
00:11:43,392 --> 00:11:47,325
[Finds Idiot Kook and Idiot Big-nose
deeper in the woods.]

221
00:11:47,325 --> 00:11:48,835
Is that a man or a woman?

222
00:11:50,115 --> 00:11:53,795
[Could that person be...]

223
00:11:53,795 --> 00:11:57,297
[Sa Yeon the tuna?]

224
00:11:57,997 --> 00:11:59,761
You two wait right there.

225
00:11:59,762 --> 00:12:02,969
- Not here, we're not here.
- We're not here.

226
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:05,313
[Immediately goes into hiding.]

227
00:12:06,155 --> 00:12:07,985
We're not here!

228
00:12:07,986 --> 00:12:09,450
Who's this?

229
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:12,854
- She can't see us...
- I don't think she can see us.

230
00:12:12,855 --> 00:12:16,113
- Idiots, let us see your faces.
- I don't think she can see us.

231
00:12:17,607 --> 00:12:18,929
Idiot Kook!

232
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:21,555
I will be your fair princess!

233
00:12:21,909 --> 00:12:24,235
I will be your fair princess!

234
00:12:24,236 --> 00:12:26,308
[You two are my foolish idiots.]

235
00:12:27,599 --> 00:12:28,894
- No, we can't!
- There you go!

236
00:12:28,895 --> 00:12:29,955
Sa Yeon...

237
00:12:31,325 --> 00:12:33,939
[Blank Princess is extremely popular today.]

238
00:12:33,939 --> 00:12:35,267
- You're much better.
- You're better.

239
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:39,613
Forget it!
I'm not going to be your fair princess!

240
00:12:39,614 --> 00:12:42,099
- You're better... stay with us.
- I'm not going to be your princess.

241
00:12:42,441 --> 00:12:44,395
[Forget it!]

242
00:12:44,396 --> 00:12:45,737
Come on, let's go.

243
00:12:46,709 --> 00:12:48,029
Hurry up and come on.

244
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:54,590
You two...
I'm going to train you very hard.

245
00:12:58,735 --> 00:13:01,087
I think someone's coming.
Right?

246
00:13:01,717 --> 00:13:03,194
It's Uee!

247
00:13:03,195 --> 00:13:05,229
[Wow... Princess Uee!]

248
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:08,047
At last!

249
00:13:08,048 --> 00:13:10,019
- Uee!
- I miss you!

250
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:11,451
Uee!

251
00:13:13,115 --> 00:13:14,292
Uee!

252
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:16,371
- Uee!
- What is it? Who's making you cry?

253
00:13:16,372 --> 00:13:19,273
You have no idea how much
I've been searching for you!

254
00:13:19,749 --> 00:13:21,609
[Seriously?]

255
00:13:22,006 --> 00:13:24,547
- Uee!
- I miss you!

256
00:13:25,043 --> 00:13:27,361
<i>- Uee!
- We missed you!</i>

257
00:13:27,361 --> 00:13:30,113
[At last, their long awaited
'Uee, I miss you' project is fulfilled.]

258
00:13:30,114 --> 00:13:31,804
- I've missed you.
- Uee...

259
00:13:34,584 --> 00:13:35,749
Many times on the show,
we always said...

260
00:13:36,344 --> 00:13:40,020
[Her name was shouted out
like it was a force of habit.]

261
00:13:41,786 --> 00:13:43,789
- Uee..
- I miss you.

262
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:45,432
I want to go somewhere else.

263
00:13:46,119 --> 00:13:48,607
[With the way their dressed,
it's understandable...]

264
00:13:48,608 --> 00:13:49,952
- Why are we made to wear this?
- What's the deal with our outfits?

265
00:13:49,953 --> 00:13:51,519
I really want to go somewhere else.

266
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:53,383
Seriously... why didn't you tell us sooner
that Uee was going to be on today?

267
00:13:53,383 --> 00:13:54,953
I should've came dressed
in my suit today.

268
00:13:55,924 --> 00:13:58,263
We're just dressed like this right now
because of a shoot we had earlier.

269
00:13:58,263 --> 00:13:59,852
- Really?
- I'm going to change into my suit now.

270
00:14:01,539 --> 00:14:04,410
- Does this mean Uee and the two of us...
- I'm...

271
00:14:04,411 --> 00:14:07,362
your Fair Princess.

272
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:09,274
[Seriously?]

273
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:13,577
[A Uee-Brothers celebration.]

274
00:14:13,577 --> 00:14:17,351
It's a celebration!
It's a celebration!

275
00:14:19,136 --> 00:14:20,512
Do you want a dried persimmon?

276
00:14:21,048 --> 00:14:22,555
Foolish idiot!

277
00:14:22,556 --> 00:14:24,685
[Idiot Gary putting the moves on
Princess Ji Hyo?]

278
00:14:25,447 --> 00:14:28,851
I have to train you to become
the ultimate General.

279
00:14:29,414 --> 00:14:30,670
Let's have a dried persimmon
before we do that.

280
00:14:31,848 --> 00:14:35,173
[In that case, Princess Blank is...]

281
00:14:35,173 --> 00:14:37,118
Let's go, you foolish idiots.

282
00:14:37,119 --> 00:14:38,548
[Chooses Idiot Gary and Idiot Ro-Ro!]

283
00:14:40,334 --> 00:14:42,769
[Idiot Ro-Ro being a very good listener....]

284
00:14:42,769 --> 00:14:43,994
- Let's go!
- Hey!

285
00:14:43,995 --> 00:14:45,709
You two look very good together.

286
00:14:48,433 --> 00:14:50,632
I saw Kwang Soo earlier,
and he really does look like an idiot.

287
00:14:50,633 --> 00:14:51,788
When did you see him?

288
00:14:52,917 --> 00:14:55,142
[We're scared that we may see
these guys in our dreams.]

289
00:14:55,142 --> 00:14:58,954
<i>Our brave princess has to lead and
teach our foolish idiots...</i>

290
00:14:58,955 --> 00:15:02,076
<i>and have them become the
ultimate winners at the final competition.</i>

291
00:15:02,244 --> 00:15:04,491
<i>The team that wins each
of the missions...</i>

292
00:15:04,492 --> 00:15:08,646
<i>will be given a princess
name tag that they can use</i>

293
00:15:08,646 --> 00:15:10,187
<i>at the final battle.</i>

294
00:15:13,382 --> 00:15:16,353
[Orange idiot team gains a name tag
for being the first team to arrive.]

295
00:15:17,566 --> 00:15:18,847
[Quenching their thirst first.]

296
00:15:19,694 --> 00:15:21,756
Let's see where we have to go.

297
00:15:22,011 --> 00:15:24,498
<i>Go to the 'D' spa in Yongsan.</i>

298
00:15:25,605 --> 00:15:26,672
- Hey!
- This is so embarrassing.

299
00:15:27,552 --> 00:15:30,268
[Extremely embarrassed at having to
walk around with these two.]

300
00:15:32,445 --> 00:15:33,667
What did you say?

301
00:15:33,668 --> 00:15:34,888
You idiots!

302
00:15:35,426 --> 00:15:38,422
- Is that you, Gary?
- You look like a movie star.

303
00:15:40,626 --> 00:15:43,982
[The idiot act in full bloom.]

304
00:15:43,982 --> 00:15:48,173
- Gary... this is Ki Bum.
- You parted your hair down the middle?

305
00:15:48,174 --> 00:15:51,508
[More awful they look
the more you look at them.]

306
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:53,708
Aren't you the doctor from Astro Boy?

307
00:15:54,071 --> 00:15:55,964
Wait, you weren't wearing the glasses
that's attached to the big nose?

308
00:15:56,178 --> 00:15:58,797
- Your nose wasn't fake?
- What are you talking about?

309
00:15:58,797 --> 00:16:00,578
- This is my nose!
- You're lying!

310
00:16:00,579 --> 00:16:02,171
My nose!

311
00:16:02,307 --> 00:16:03,746
Are you okay?

312
00:16:03,747 --> 00:16:05,971
Who hit my boy?
Show yourself!

313
00:16:05,971 --> 00:16:08,269
- Who hit my stupid idiot?
- I hit him!

314
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:10,705
- I'm the one who hit the idiot!
- Come out here immediately!

315
00:16:10,705 --> 00:16:13,167
He's my idiot!
Don't touch him!

316
00:16:13,168 --> 00:16:14,772
- All of you, get out!
- Oh my goodness...

317
00:16:15,673 --> 00:16:17,903
- Go away... go away!
- Go away!

318
00:16:17,904 --> 00:16:19,221
- I said, go away!
- Go!

319
00:16:19,222 --> 00:16:21,229
What is it that you keep
saying to her?

320
00:16:21,419 --> 00:16:23,881
[What is it that he's saying?]

321
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:27,021
You stupid idiots...

322
00:16:27,022 --> 00:16:30,671
<i>Our brave princess has to lead and
teach our foolish idiots...</i>

323
00:16:30,671 --> 00:16:33,463
<i>and the team that wins at the final battle
will become our ultimate winners for the day.</i>

324
00:16:33,463 --> 00:16:34,764
- Is that right?
- She has to teach us?

325
00:16:35,124 --> 00:16:37,047
- We're on our way!
- Let's go.

326
00:16:37,048 --> 00:16:38,647
- Let's go.
- We're on our way!

327
00:16:38,647 --> 00:16:40,793
- Uee!
- I miss you!

328
00:16:40,794 --> 00:16:42,373
We really did miss you.

329
00:16:42,724 --> 00:16:45,233
[Finally able to tell the real Uee
that they miss her to her face!]

330
00:16:45,951 --> 00:16:47,900
- Uee!
- I miss you!

331
00:16:47,901 --> 00:16:48,927
[I'm the reason for their famous saying!]

332
00:16:51,017 --> 00:16:53,503
[Uee's finally here! Yay!]

333
00:16:57,329 --> 00:17:00,917
<i>- Where are we going?
- We're going to the 'D' spa in Yongsan.</i>

334
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:03,299
Idiot, I can't pull this.

335
00:17:03,854 --> 00:17:06,035
You're not supposed to pull this.

336
00:17:06,036 --> 00:17:07,610
You're supposed to turn it.

337
00:17:10,778 --> 00:17:11,988
One shot?

338
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:16,459
Okay, let's go.

339
00:17:16,459 --> 00:17:17,738
[The Green Idiot Team is
also on their way!]

340
00:17:17,739 --> 00:17:19,094
Go go, go!

00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:34,345
they know me very well.
So mention me when you get in there.

845
00:43:34,383 --> 00:43:35,667
- Where?
- Boss!

846
00:43:35,668 --> 00:43:36,923
Boss!

847
00:43:37,188 --> 00:43:39,384
[Oh! That's a familiar face!]

848
00:43:39,385 --> 00:43:41,336
Gary... let's go!

849
00:43:41,337 --> 00:43:43,096
How you been?

850
00:43:43,097 --> 00:43:44,221
Hello, Sir!

851
00:43:44,221 --> 00:43:49,164
[Edward, whom they've met when they came
to do a mission here previously!]

852
00:43:49,387 --> 00:43:51,758
- You look younger.
- Really?

853
00:43:51,759 --> 00:43:53,254
You too!

854
00:43:55,116 --> 00:43:56,136
Nice to meet you.

855
00:43:57,604 --> 00:44:00,254
[They didn't notice it before, but the
store next to it belongs to him also?]

856
00:44:00,254 --> 00:44:02,609
Here, here, and there.

857
00:44:03,415 --> 00:44:05,979
- Rich guy!
- This owner here...

858
00:44:05,980 --> 00:44:07,329
This is my ally.

859
00:44:08,248 --> 00:44:10,523
- Congratulations.
- Are you guys talking about something funny?

860
00:44:12,131 --> 00:44:13,287
Thank you very much, Sir.

861
00:44:13,287 --> 00:44:16,291
[No matter,
this is a fateful encounter as well.]

862
00:44:16,292 --> 00:44:18,933
- Happy new year.
- Yes, goodbye.

863
00:44:21,175 --> 00:44:24,774
[The idiots must choose between the Thai and
American restaurants and make their move.]

864
00:44:25,874 --> 00:44:31,460
<i>In order to further strengthen their idiots,
the fair princesses separated them...</i>

865
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:34,515
<i>to test their hearts.</i>

866
00:44:37,029 --> 00:44:41,760
[Just what are the two missions
that await them at these restaurants?]

867
00:44:42,509 --> 00:44:45,776
[A flower adorned limbo bar
at the Thai restaurant?]

868
00:44:45,777 --> 00:44:47,305
What is this?
We're in trouble.

869
00:44:47,305 --> 00:44:49,476
- I'm not good at limbo.
- Why are you doing this to us?

870
00:44:50,124 --> 00:44:51,432
Why...

871
00:44:51,888 --> 00:44:55,932
<i>While shouting out 'Princess, your highness',
sit up and down five times.</i>

872
00:44:55,933 --> 00:44:58,776
<i>and follow through by passing under
the limbo bar</i>

873
00:44:58,777 --> 00:45:00,937
<i>and shout out, 'All hail Princess,
your highness' to win the mission.</i>

874
00:45:00,938 --> 00:45:02,234
Five times?

875
00:45:02,849 --> 00:45:05,500
What did you say?
I have to hold and carry the princess?

876
00:45:05,501 --> 00:45:08,882
[Hopeless...]

877
00:45:08,883 --> 00:45:10,116
This is really worrisome.

878
00:45:10,117 --> 00:45:12,727
[Weak Suk Jin to carry Princess Sa Yeon?]

879
00:45:12,727 --> 00:45:15,953
- Since he has to carry me...
- Our knees can't touch either?

880
00:45:15,954 --> 00:45:17,573
- Of course, they can't.
- Then how can we pass?

881
00:45:17,574 --> 00:45:19,496
We can't jump over the bar, right?

882
00:45:21,303 --> 00:45:26,345
[Jae Suk can't participate this round because
Princess Uee isn't at this location.]

883
00:45:26,346 --> 00:45:27,618
Then I'll proceed with the game.

884
00:45:28,241 --> 00:45:30,434
In that case...
Suk Jin, why don't you start?

885
00:45:31,510 --> 00:45:32,784
Hey...

886
00:45:32,785 --> 00:45:34,115
Just because it's not your legs
at stake here...

887
00:45:35,340 --> 00:45:37,845
- Just because they're not your legs...
- Well, I have nothing to lose here.

888
00:45:38,193 --> 00:45:41,400
[Proceeding without any hesitation since
he's not the one having to lift anyone.]

889
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:44,797
But Sa Yeon... this is no joke,
but Sa Yeon's lost a lot of weight.

890
00:45:44,798 --> 00:45:47,787
- Sa Yeon was very sick for a while.
- My husband told me I was nothing but bones.

891
00:45:48,959 --> 00:45:52,197
- I'm serious.
- You're no longer the tuna here then.

892
00:45:52,667 --> 00:45:56,165
- You really have lost a lot of weight.
- I miss our Tuna Sa Yeon.

893
00:45:58,318 --> 00:46:00,763
[Anyways, Orange Idiot Team
is the first to step up to the challenge.]

894
00:46:00,763 --> 00:46:02,728
I've had to carry Sa Yeon twice
in our past missions...

895
00:46:02,729 --> 00:46:04,660
It was difficult for two people
to carry her together.

896
00:46:06,392 --> 00:46:11,087
[Back in Sa Yeon's tuna days?
The memories still fresh in his mind.]

897
00:46:11,088 --> 00:46:12,636
- How much do you weigh?
- What?

898
00:46:12,636 --> 00:46:14,875
- How much do you weigh, Suk Jin?
- I weigh 76 kg?

899
00:46:14,876 --> 00:46:16,067
- I see...
- How much do you weigh?

900
00:46:16,067 --> 00:46:17,493
There's not much difference there.

901
00:46:19,408 --> 00:46:21,780
[Adorable Sa Yeon, how will it go this time?]

902
00:46:24,321 --> 00:46:27,329
[The moment he lifts her up... crash.]

903
00:46:27,594 --> 00:46:29,515
- Hey!
- Sa Yeon, are you okay?

904
00:46:29,516 --> 00:46:32,215
[Come on, that's just too...]

905
00:46:33,809 --> 00:46:35,485
I really am trying my best.

906
00:46:35,486 --> 00:46:37,398
I wasn't joking around,
but I was really trying.

907
00:46:37,399 --> 00:46:39,520
The viewers are going to think that
Sa Yeon's really heavy now.

908
00:46:39,521 --> 00:46:42,051
- I wasn't kidding, but was trying hard.
- Sa Yeon, I'll do it.

909
00:46:42,052 --> 00:46:44,747
- Here, let me lift you up.
- One, two, three.

910
00:46:49,239 --> 00:46:52,065
- You got it. One, two, three.
- You said I got this?

911
00:46:53,061 --> 00:46:55,205
Let's go.
One, two, three.

912
00:46:56,822 --> 00:46:58,537
[I can't...]

913
00:47:01,716 --> 00:47:04,401
What do you mean, one?
Sa Yeon, I don't think I can do this.

914
00:47:07,511 --> 00:47:09,947
[Even setting her back down
is no easy task!]

915
00:47:13,087 --> 00:47:15,451
[Drops her to the ground.]

916
00:47:15,911 --> 00:47:18,307
Why are you guys so weak?

917
00:47:18,308 --> 00:47:21,258
[Will the Orange Idiot Team be able to
lift Sa Yeon Princess for the mission?]

918
00:47:22,057 --> 00:47:24,353
[At the same time,
at the American pizza place.]

919
00:47:24,353 --> 00:47:28,101
[What's the mission here?]

920
00:47:28,734 --> 00:47:31,385
[What's the mission that makes her smile
like that as soon as she sees the card?]

921
00:47:31,386 --> 00:47:32,838
- What do we do?
- Why?

922
00:47:33,607 --> 00:47:37,431
Play the stick biscuit game...

923
00:47:44,735 --> 00:47:47,213
- This game? Really?
- I...

924
00:47:47,214 --> 00:47:52,206
[Play the biscuit game with the princess and
if there's less than 1.5 cm left, you win!]

925
00:47:52,206 --> 00:47:56,383
[Since his princess is the only one present,
only Kwang Soo and Uee can play the game.]

926
00:47:56,384 --> 00:47:58,485
Why?
How can you do that?

927
00:47:58,486 --> 00:48:00,557
Then there's no reason for me
to be here right now.

928
00:48:00,901 --> 00:48:04,542
[You have to play the game when your
Princess Ji Hyo comes to the restaurant.]

929
00:48:05,164 --> 00:48:06,565
Kwang Soo, come up here.

930
00:48:06,566 --> 00:48:07,724
Kwang Soo...

931
00:48:07,725 --> 00:48:12,072
[It's just a process that any idiot has to
go through so why do you look so...]

932
00:48:13,690 --> 00:48:14,814
<i>Challenge.</i>

933
00:48:14,815 --> 00:48:16,166
I'm so nervous.

934
00:48:17,931 --> 00:48:20,522
- That's not the nervousness she means.
- Why are you nervous?

935
00:48:20,523 --> 00:48:22,781
That's not the nervousness
that she's referring to.

936
00:48:22,782 --> 00:48:24,824
Do you have any heart calming medicine?

937
00:48:24,997 --> 00:48:26,833
This is just a game.

938
00:48:27,283 --> 00:48:28,943
- Challenge.
- Okay, challenge.

939
00:48:28,944 --> 00:48:31,923
[Green Idiot Team's Uee and Kwang Soo.]

940
00:48:31,924 --> 00:48:33,833
<i>Is Uee making the move?</i>

941
00:48:37,384 --> 00:48:39,352
Kwang Soo, why do you keep backing up?

942
00:48:40,010 --> 00:48:41,974
Kwang Soo, why do you keep backing up?

943
00:48:42,336 --> 00:48:43,436
No, no I'm not.

944
00:48:43,437 --> 00:48:44,577
Let's do it again.

945
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:48,236
[Unlimited chances until they succeed.]

946
00:48:48,866 --> 00:48:50,562
- Kwang Soo, you can't back up, okay?
- Okay.

947
00:48:50,563 --> 00:48:53,259
[Uee is confidently playing the game,
so why is Kwang Soo...]

948
00:48:54,220 --> 00:48:55,424
Challenge.

949
00:49:06,416 --> 00:49:07,714
I don't think I can do this!

950
00:49:07,715 --> 00:49:09,023
I don't think I can do this!

951
00:49:09,930 --> 00:49:11,146
I can't do this!

952
00:49:11,147 --> 00:49:12,829
Wow... that's a beautiful scene.

953
00:49:14,589 --> 00:49:16,681
[Fails with a whole 6 cm!]

954
00:49:16,681 --> 00:49:18,353
What happens if the whole thing disappears?

955
00:49:18,354 --> 00:49:21,705
[Huh? In order to make it disappear...]

956
00:49:21,706 --> 00:49:22,994
I was just curious.

957
00:49:25,860 --> 00:49:28,208
[On the other hand...]

958
00:49:28,788 --> 00:49:31,670
But Ji Hyo is pretty muscular...

959
00:49:34,124 --> 00:49:36,813
[Blue Idiot Team's Ha Ha and
Blank Princess step up to the challenge.]

960
00:49:37,896 --> 00:49:39,288
You can definitely do it.

961
00:49:46,558 --> 00:49:48,667
[Definitely heard something breaking...]

962
00:49:52,674 --> 00:49:54,144
Go Eun!

963
00:49:54,145 --> 00:49:55,957
Go Eun, I'm sorry!

964
00:49:56,796 --> 00:50:00,389
[How could such a sound be heard
when it's not like he lifted up a boulder?]

965
00:50:00,389 --> 00:50:02,070
It sounded like a tree breaking.

966
00:50:02,071 --> 00:50:03,642
What the heck is this?

967
00:50:05,211 --> 00:50:08,209
[Orange Idiot Team's second attempt.]

968
00:50:08,210 --> 00:50:11,366
- Sa Yeon, you're light as a feather.
- She's not that bad, and you can do this.

969
00:50:11,367 --> 00:50:13,564
I'm a pretty light person.
I really did lose a lot of weight.

970
00:50:20,193 --> 00:50:23,414
[Big-nosed idiot fails from the get-go again
in his attempt to lift up Plump Princess.]

971
00:50:25,547 --> 00:50:27,374
What is this?

972
00:50:27,375 --> 00:50:29,908
Sa Yeon, give it one last try
and if it doesn't work again...

973
00:50:29,908 --> 00:50:31,894
go over to the other restaurant to do the
mission with Jong Kook, then come back.

974
00:50:31,894 --> 00:50:34,557
- Okay, I think I'll do that.
- Can you help lift up her legs?

975
00:50:34,558 --> 00:50:37,958
[With Jae Suk's help,
Suk Jin attempts to lift up Sa Yeon again.]

976
00:50:40,987 --> 00:50:42,193
Set, go.

977
00:50:42,194 --> 00:50:46,559
[Sit up and down five times while
shouting out 'Princess, your highness']

978
00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:47,653
Your highness...

979
00:50:49,457 --> 00:50:50,703
Princess...

980
00:50:55,927 --> 00:50:58,906
[Suddenly bursts out into laughter
without even knowing the reason why.]

981
00:50:59,430 --> 00:51:01,017
Why are you laughing?

982
00:51:02,814 --> 00:51:04,264
He just keeps laughing.

983
00:51:05,007 --> 00:51:06,680
Are you okay?

984
00:51:06,681 --> 00:51:09,074
- Sa Yeon...
- This team has no chance.

985
00:51:09,074 --> 00:51:11,259
Just hurry up and go see Jong Kook.

986
00:51:11,491 --> 00:51:13,914
- This is really starting to make me mad.
- It's because Suk Jin's too weak.

987
00:51:13,915 --> 00:51:16,101
You're really not that heavy.

988
00:51:16,102 --> 00:51:18,730
- Sa Yeon, it's not because of you.
- I really have become much lighter.

989
00:51:20,322 --> 00:51:24,659
[Brief rest time while tape reel
is being replaced.]

990
00:51:24,660 --> 00:51:27,104
- You really want to do it?
- Yeah, for real.

991
00:51:27,105 --> 00:51:28,926
I'll do the slate.

992
00:51:28,927 --> 00:51:31,840
- One, two, three.
- She's so strong.

993
00:51:33,217 --> 00:51:37,595
[Is Big-nosed Brother losing to Sa Yeon
in arm wrestling?]

994
00:51:38,879 --> 00:51:41,942
- Are you doing this for real?
- Why are you dangling like that?

995
00:51:42,039 --> 00:51:44,833
[Idiot Big-nose really can't
even budge his hand!]

996
00:51:44,834 --> 00:51:47,526
- This is just absurd!
- Suk Jin, you really can't move her?

997
00:51:48,292 --> 00:51:52,157
[That means he's already pretty much
lost the game...]

998
00:51:56,363 --> 00:51:57,869
Did you win your mission?

999
00:51:58,653 --> 00:52:03,161
[Plump Princess having made her way over
after teaching Idiot Big-nose a lesson.]

1000
00:52:03,162 --> 00:52:04,434
What game are you playing?

1001
00:52:04,435 --> 00:52:07,810
I need to win the game quickly
and take Jong Kook back with me.

1002
00:52:07,811 --> 00:52:09,968
[Planning on taking Jong Kook back
with her after winning this mission.]

1003
00:52:14,511 --> 00:52:17,256
- Why does Kwang Soo look like that?
- Why are your hands gripped in a fist?

1004
00:52:17,257 --> 00:52:20,554
<i>No, you can't do it like that!
With your teeth... yes, like that!</i>

1005
00:52:22,468 --> 00:52:24,561
[Green Idiot Team fails for having stopped
in the middle of their attempt.]

1006
00:52:25,581 --> 00:52:29,766
[Giraffe still playing the game
with his feelings worn on his sleeve.]

1007
00:52:29,766 --> 00:52:31,017
[This is a nice mission.]

1008
00:52:31,764 --> 00:52:33,743
- Sa Yeon...
- Let me wipe my nose first.

1009
00:52:34,454 --> 00:52:36,611
Why is your nose running?

1010
00:52:36,612 --> 00:52:38,095
[Don't misunderstand,
it's just that she has a slight cold...]

1011
00:52:38,095 --> 00:52:41,628
- You want me to hold onto it?
- Go ahead. I'm too nervous.

1012
00:52:42,774 --> 00:52:44,109
Isn't it nerve wrecking?

1013
00:52:44,110 --> 00:52:47,400
[Worry about the nervousness later,
and just concentrate on the game first!]

1014
00:52:48,619 --> 00:52:53,553
[Must complete the mission here first...
and hurry back to the limbo mission.]

1015
00:52:53,554 --> 00:52:56,275
- Okay, let's do a god job.
- Okay, I'll bite onto it.

1016
00:52:56,276 --> 00:52:57,552
- She says, let's do a good job.
- Here we go.

1017
00:52:59,149 --> 00:53:01,875
[Plump Princess coming out aggressively.]

1018
00:53:02,993 --> 00:53:06,173
[Blue Idiot Team's Blank Princess
makes her way over here first as well.]

1019
00:53:09,530 --> 00:53:11,288
Sa Yeon looks way too eager.

1020
00:53:11,826 --> 00:53:13,595
[Working hard!]

1021
00:53:18,281 --> 00:53:20,289
[Wow! That looks really short!]

1022
00:53:20,290 --> 00:53:21,455
Here it is!

1023
00:53:21,958 --> 00:53:24,029
[Almost nothing but crumbs left
of their biscuit!]

1024
00:53:27,816 --> 00:53:29,252
- Hey!
- Hey!

1025
00:53:31,162 --> 00:53:34,081
[Idiot Giraffe destroys the evidence of
Orange Idiot Team's work!]

1026
00:53:34,082 --> 00:53:35,609
Have you lost your mind?

1027
00:53:35,642 --> 00:53:39,185
[Quickly destroying the evidence because
it looked as though they succeeded!]

1028
00:53:39,723 --> 00:53:41,583
- That was it!
- That was our piece!

1029
00:53:41,584 --> 00:53:43,721
Ah... so that was the piece.

1030
00:53:45,093 --> 00:53:46,579
Ah... sorry, I'm sorry.

1031
00:53:46,580 --> 00:53:49,817
<i>It doesn't count if we can't
measure it with our ruler.</i>

1032
00:53:49,818 --> 00:53:50,991
[Mission failed due to the writer's rules.]

1033
00:53:50,992 --> 00:53:52,672
[Plan success]

1034
00:53:58,022 --> 00:54:01,761
[Blue Idiot Team's Blank Princess
and Idiot Gary's turn.]

1035
00:54:01,761 --> 00:54:05,572
[Now that we think about it,
this is the Monday Couple...]

1036
00:54:06,375 --> 00:54:08,821
- You want to eat the chocolate?
- No.

1037
00:54:12,535 --> 00:54:14,243
- Say 'challenge' before you start.
- Challenge.

1038
00:54:14,243 --> 00:54:15,949
- Let's do this in one try, Ji Hyo.
- One try.

1039
00:54:17,219 --> 00:54:19,486
Now that I'm really about to do it,
I'm getting nervous.

1040
00:54:21,152 --> 00:54:22,255
I really am nervous.

1041
00:54:22,256 --> 00:54:25,573
[Even more awkward for two people who knows
each other so well to play the game together.]

1042
00:54:29,482 --> 00:54:30,768
Are you going to close your eyes?

1043
00:54:31,496 --> 00:54:32,780
Are you going to close your eyes?

1044
00:54:34,304 --> 00:54:36,398
- We have to let each other know.
- Why?

1045
00:54:36,399 --> 00:54:38,458
What's so important about that?
I don't know.

1046
00:54:38,459 --> 00:54:40,545
You're not going to lean your head,
are you?

1047
00:54:41,212 --> 00:54:42,248
Okay.

1048
00:54:44,985 --> 00:54:48,036
- Where are you looking at?
- Looking at the ceiling because I feel shy.

1049
00:54:48,037 --> 00:54:49,342
Okay, go for it.

1050
00:54:49,343 --> 00:54:51,078
[They're so sweet and adorable.]

1051
00:54:52,321 --> 00:54:54,733
[The Blue Idiot Team's Monday Couple
starts their challenge at last!]

1052
00:54:56,850 --> 00:54:58,315
[Riveted]

1053
00:54:59,976 --> 00:55:01,675
<i>You have to turn your head.</i>

1054
00:55:02,401 --> 00:55:03,813
Why?

1055
00:55:04,968 --> 00:55:06,370
Why?

1056
00:55:06,371 --> 00:55:09,169
[Blue Idiot Team's Monday Couple - Fail.]

1057
00:55:09,170 --> 00:55:11,177
- He has to grab you. If he doesn't...
- It's just too shaky.

1058
00:55:11,178 --> 00:55:12,428
[It would be easier to grab
the other person's head...]

1059
00:55:13,137 --> 00:55:14,579
That shocked me.

1060
00:55:16,024 --> 00:55:19,873
[What did they score?
Fails at 4.3 cm.]

1061
00:55:19,874 --> 00:55:21,928
Gary, I think I can do it.
I think I can do it this time.

1062
00:55:22,765 --> 00:55:25,083
I think Gary looks more nervous
than Ji Hyo is.

1063
00:55:25,084 --> 00:55:26,498
- Can we go right now?
- It's our turn.

1064
00:55:28,143 --> 00:55:29,289
It's our turn.

1065
00:55:29,289 --> 00:55:31,688
Can we just continue shooting
the scene on our own?

1066
00:55:32,267 --> 00:55:33,934
We're going to keep shooting, okay?

1067
00:55:33,935 --> 00:55:36,838
[He's unstoppable...]

1068
00:55:36,839 --> 00:55:38,091
- Let's just end this.
- Okay.

1069
00:55:38,541 --> 00:55:41,487
[At the same time, at the Thai restaurant...]

1070
00:55:42,791 --> 00:55:46,878
[On suspension with all the
Princesses on a trip over to America?]

1071
00:55:46,878 --> 00:55:48,797
- Suk Jin, was that arm wrestling for real?
- No.

1072
00:55:48,798 --> 00:55:51,330
What do you mean, no?
You were hanging on for dear life.

1073
00:55:51,865 --> 00:55:55,174
- I was just reacting to it to be funny.
- Even your toes were tightened up.

1074
00:55:55,175 --> 00:55:57,627
- It was all just part of my reaction.
- I think you're lying.

1075
00:55:57,628 --> 00:55:59,627
No, come on...
did my acting look natural?

1076
00:56:01,737 --> 00:56:04,594
Seeing just how natural it was,
we know it wasn't acting.

1077
00:56:04,595 --> 00:56:07,882
When you look natural,
that means it's for real with you.

1078
00:56:07,883 --> 00:56:09,857
- Because you're a bad actor.
- You really are a horrible actor.

1079
00:56:10,457 --> 00:56:12,175
I really made it look natural, didn't I?

1080
00:56:13,204 --> 00:56:15,691
[Orange Idiot Team's challenge.]

1081
00:56:16,535 --> 00:56:21,847
[If the Giraffe hadn't crushed their biscuit,
they probably would've passed by now.]

1082
00:56:29,759 --> 00:56:32,378
[A fragment fell on the plate!]

1083
00:56:32,378 --> 00:56:34,602
[Amazing!]

1084
00:56:34,819 --> 00:56:36,824
- My neck feels stiff.
- I'm sorry to tell you this, but...

1085
00:56:36,825 --> 00:56:38,738
You can pick whichever one you want
to measure.

1086
00:56:39,434 --> 00:56:41,043
Oh my, oh my...

1087
00:56:41,044 --> 00:56:42,956
Look at how short this one is.

1088
00:56:42,957 --> 00:56:46,834
[Time to reveal the results...
exactly 1 cm.]

1089
00:56:46,835 --> 00:56:49,618
[Orange Idiot Team succeeds
their America mission!]

1090
00:56:49,619 --> 00:56:52,009
Seriously... having no feelings
really is the best.

1091
00:56:52,010 --> 00:56:54,006
You guys aren't able to do it
because there are feelings there.

1092
00:56:54,356 --> 00:56:56,080
<i>You're just pretending that you don't
have any feelings, Sa Yeon!</i>

1093
00:56:56,619 --> 00:56:58,358
- Let's go, Sa Yeon.
- You're going with her, Jong Kook?

1094
00:56:58,359 --> 00:57:01,270
- Of course. I can go with her, right?
- You only have one mission left to go.

1095
00:57:01,271 --> 00:57:02,482
[Orange Idiot Team is on the clear!
Off to Thailand they go!]

1096
00:57:02,483 --> 00:57:03,742
Kwang Soo, just relax.

1097
00:57:04,497 --> 00:57:06,030
This is nice.

1098
00:57:06,031 --> 00:57:09,222
- Sa Yeon, where do we go now?
- We have to go to the Thai restaurant now.

1099
00:57:09,223 --> 00:57:11,544
- Thailand... let's go to Thailand.
- Yes.

1100
00:57:16,697 --> 00:57:18,495
That's too long.

1101
00:57:19,933 --> 00:57:22,378
[Must be less than 1.5 cm to succeed!
Green Idiot Team fails at 2 cm.]

1102
00:57:22,378 --> 00:57:23,464
Kwang Soo, I'll come to you.

1103
00:57:24,399 --> 00:57:26,751
Why are you acting like
nothing's going on?

1104
00:57:29,313 --> 00:57:32,607
[It's now the Monday Couple of
Blue Idiot Team's turn.]

1105
00:57:37,457 --> 00:57:41,355
[Forget about any feelings
just like Sa Yeon said?]

1106
00:57:50,879 --> 00:57:52,035
It's short.

1107
00:57:52,434 --> 00:57:54,727
[What will be the Monday Couple's result?]

1108
00:57:54,727 --> 00:57:57,281
[Succeeds at 1.2 cm!]

1109
00:57:57,281 --> 00:57:58,392
Success!

1110
00:58:01,091 --> 00:58:03,498
I'd like to go for a 7mm challenge this time.

1111
00:58:04,751 --> 00:58:09,153
[Blue Idiot Team must also hurry to Thailand
to complete their last mission.]

1112
00:58:09,154 --> 00:58:10,309
Challenge.

1113
00:58:10,310 --> 00:58:13,271
[Since the Green Idiot Team is late,
they must hurry to succeed this mission.]

1114
00:58:13,986 --> 00:58:16,243
- Uee...
- You want me to say my own name?

1115
00:58:16,243 --> 00:58:17,777
- Uee...
- I miss you!

1116
00:58:19,313 --> 00:58:21,125
- Kwang Soo, I think I can do this.
- Okay.

1117
00:58:21,126 --> 00:58:23,335
I know I can do this.
I believe in you, okay?

1118
00:58:25,320 --> 00:58:26,984
Why do you keep doing that?

1119
00:58:26,985 --> 00:58:29,779
[Everyone's gathering in Thailand.]

1120
00:58:29,780 --> 00:58:31,031
They're here.

1121
00:58:31,032 --> 00:58:33,690
What is Kwang Soo doing with
Uee over there?

1122
00:58:35,393 --> 00:58:40,089
[An armload of handmade pies
after completing their America mission.]

1123
00:58:42,558 --> 00:58:44,289
It didn't take long.

1124
00:58:46,692 --> 00:58:51,216
[Having been hungry,
everyone taking a piece to share.]

1125
00:58:51,217 --> 00:58:52,266
- Break it off.
- Sa Yeon...

1126
00:58:52,267 --> 00:58:54,977
You shouldn't be eating right now
when you still have to do this mission.

1127
00:58:55,465 --> 00:58:57,889
- You shouldn't be eating.
- Why?

1128
00:58:58,575 --> 00:59:00,558
You can't lift me up anyways,
so what does this matter?

1129
00:59:00,559 --> 00:59:02,262
Just hand it over.

1130
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:04,178
[But I'm hungry...]

1131
00:59:04,178 --> 00:59:05,543
After... you can eat after the mission.

1132
00:59:07,110 --> 00:59:10,559
[Princess Uee and the Giraffe still at it
when they were first to start the mission.]

1133
00:59:14,482 --> 00:59:16,721
[That's short!]

1134
00:59:17,557 --> 00:59:20,497
[Sure of their success this time?]

1135
00:59:25,197 --> 00:59:28,911
[At... 1cm. Success!]

1136
00:59:41,873 --> 00:59:43,884
- Is it this way?
- Here... it's right here.

1137
00:59:43,885 --> 00:59:46,023
- Hello.
- Hello.

1138
00:59:47,573 --> 00:59:48,795
Kwang Soo!

1139
00:59:49,361 --> 00:59:52,480
- Jae Suk, I'm so sorry!
- What do you have to be sorry about?

1140
00:59:52,481 --> 00:59:54,809
[But the sight of them walking together
is a bit...]

1141
00:59:54,809 --> 00:59:57,341
Why do you two look like you're just
returning from your honeymoon?

1142
00:59:57,342 --> 01:00:00,438
Telling me that you're sorry...
what do you have to be sorry about?

1143
01:00:00,439 --> 01:00:02,011
[Bearing gifts with their blushing faces...]

1144
01:00:02,145 --> 01:00:03,852
- I oppose this!
- What?

1145
01:00:03,853 --> 01:00:06,353
- Why are you opposing this?
- I oppose this marriage!

1146
01:00:06,354 --> 01:00:08,009
<i>I second that!</i>

1147
01:00:08,010 --> 01:00:10,520
No way!
It's too big of a loss for Uee!

1148
01:00:12,325 --> 01:00:13,934
Why are you so harsh with your words?

1149
01:00:13,935 --> 01:00:18,113
[Anyway, since all three teams are here now,
we must hurry to complete the mission here.]

1150
01:00:18,113 --> 01:00:20,835
[Green Idiot Team to take the first turn.]

1151
01:00:22,833 --> 01:00:25,879
- Uee... you're on the lighter side, right?
- What?

1152
01:00:26,869 --> 01:00:28,780
- You can keep that on.
- Keep it on?

1153
01:00:28,781 --> 01:00:31,859
- Of course.
- One, two, three.

1154
01:00:31,859 --> 01:00:33,522
Wow, Uee...

1155
01:00:38,405 --> 01:00:40,531
- What are you doing?
- Why are you rolling her over?

1156
01:00:41,344 --> 01:00:43,505
- Uee, why did you fall off?
- Are you okay?

1157
01:00:43,506 --> 01:00:49,185
[Maybe she slipped, maybe he dropped her,
maybe she's too heavy, or he's too weak...]

1158
01:00:49,186 --> 01:00:50,730
She's like a marble rolling around.

1159
01:00:50,731 --> 01:00:53,197
Uee... Uee is acting weird.

1160
01:00:55,117 --> 01:00:59,265
[A bit different feel than his prediction
of her being light as a feather?]

1161
01:00:59,265 --> 01:01:00,525
Oh my goodness...

1162
01:01:02,429 --> 01:01:04,567
- Kwang Soo, you want to try?
- Okay, I'll give it a try.

1163
01:01:04,568 --> 01:01:06,715
I'm going to give it a try.
I'll get it done for real.

1164
01:01:06,716 --> 01:01:07,843
- What?
- Let's do it.

1165
01:01:09,140 --> 01:01:12,223
- Uee!
- I miss you.

1166
01:01:13,733 --> 01:01:16,288
[Reaffirming their team bond
by shouting out the team's battle cry.]

1167
01:01:16,289 --> 01:01:20,492
We can do it too!
- Blank.. Ji! Blank...

1168
01:01:24,161 --> 01:01:25,331
Let's do it.

1169
01:01:26,260 --> 01:01:28,144
One, two, three.

1170
01:01:29,849 --> 01:01:32,316
She's not quite what you think.
It's a little different.

1171
01:01:32,317 --> 01:01:34,694
- But it'll be okay.
- So this is what you were talking about?

1172
01:01:34,695 --> 01:01:36,348
Uee's not quite what you think.

1173
01:01:36,349 --> 01:01:38,220
- Uee feels different.
- Princess...

1174
01:01:38,220 --> 01:01:43,365
- Princess, your highness...
- That's right... you're doing it.

1175
01:01:43,366 --> 01:01:45,998
- It's okay.
- Uee and Suzy are very similar.

1176
01:01:46,749 --> 01:01:49,979
[With his teeth gritted tight...]

1177
01:01:50,537 --> 01:01:52,643
I know you want to put her down,
but you have to endure it.

1178
01:01:53,763 --> 01:01:55,814
You're going to want to put her down,
but you have to get over that hump.

1179
01:01:55,815 --> 01:01:57,622
[Must pass through the limbo bar with her in
the arms and shout out, 'All hail princess!]

1180
01:01:57,622 --> 01:01:58,741
Okay, that's good.

1181
01:01:58,742 --> 01:02:01,510
You're getting the feeling that
you can't do it, right?

1182
01:02:01,511 --> 01:02:03,202
You're getting the feeling that
you can't do it, right?

1183
01:02:03,203 --> 01:02:05,077
You have to try again.
Gather up your strength again.

1184
01:02:05,078 --> 01:02:08,091
You have to get a feel for it.
That's right. Kick off your shoes.

1185
01:02:08,092 --> 01:02:09,369
Okay...

1186
01:02:09,370 --> 01:02:11,363
[Getting back into position once again.]

1187
01:02:11,364 --> 01:02:13,623
And... okay... here you go.

1188
01:02:13,624 --> 01:02:18,365
All the feelings you have for Uee are
all coming at you right now...

1189
01:02:18,366 --> 01:02:19,902
- Okay...
- Kwang Soo, when are you going to move?

1190
01:02:19,903 --> 01:02:21,760
You're feeling it right now, aren't you?
Here it comes...

1191
01:02:21,761 --> 01:02:23,667
- Kwang Soo...
- That's right, slow...

1192
01:02:23,668 --> 01:02:26,482
- That's right Kwang Soo...
- Kwang Soo, you're going to touch your head.

1193
01:02:26,483 --> 01:02:27,752
Kwang Soo...

1194
01:02:28,408 --> 01:02:31,764
[Almost touched the limbo bar
with Uee's face.]

1195
01:02:32,696 --> 01:02:33,931
I'm sorry.

1196
01:02:33,932 --> 01:02:35,782
- I'm sorry, but stay still.
- Kwang Soo...

1197
01:02:35,783 --> 01:02:37,310
Don't move.

1198
01:02:38,038 --> 01:02:39,598
- Kwang Soo...
- I'm moving bit by bit.

1199
01:02:41,372 --> 01:02:43,368
- Hey...
- You have to take off his hat.

1200
01:02:43,732 --> 01:02:46,791
[Uee's made it through,
now just Kwang Soo needs to...]

1201
01:02:46,792 --> 01:02:48,278
- Are you okay, Kwang Soo?
- I think you're going to do it.

1202
01:02:48,756 --> 01:02:53,768
[About to make his pass through the bar!]

1203
01:02:53,769 --> 01:02:56,007
- Little bit more...
- I almost have it.

1204
01:02:57,277 --> 01:02:58,726
- Kwang Soo, you're...
- Just a little bit more.

1205
01:02:58,727 --> 01:03:01,287
[Backtracking once again.]

1206
01:03:01,962 --> 01:03:05,719
[It's all in the state of mind...]

1207
01:03:08,248 --> 01:03:11,714
[His head is through,
now only his body is left!]

1208
01:03:11,715 --> 01:03:13,386
<i>You have to move your
right foot a little.</i>

1209
01:03:13,387 --> 01:03:15,200
Wow, I'm seeing Kwang Soo with
a whole new set of eyes.

1210
01:03:15,201 --> 01:03:17,771
- Kwang Soo, just a little bit more.
- You can't backtrack now.

1211
01:03:17,772 --> 01:03:20,299
- Kwang Soo looks really cool.
- You can't move back right now.

1212
01:03:20,896 --> 01:03:23,780
[Backtracks again.]

1213
01:03:24,454 --> 01:03:27,304
You can't come back here.
You really can't come back here.

1214
01:03:27,305 --> 01:03:28,776
This is so embarrassing.

1215
01:03:35,006 --> 01:03:41,459
[Idiot Giraffe gathers up his strength
for his fair princess...]

1216
01:03:43,582 --> 01:03:45,214
All hail the princess!

1217
01:03:46,023 --> 01:03:47,836
<i>All hail the princess!</i>

1218
01:03:49,952 --> 01:03:56,395
[Losing all the strength in his legs at
the last minute and stumbles on his words...]

1219
01:03:56,396 --> 01:03:57,911
What are you doing right now?

1220
01:03:57,912 --> 01:03:59,395
[Feeling bad and humiliated.]

1221
01:04:00,877 --> 01:04:03,879
[Green Idiot Team fails their attempt.]

1222
01:04:05,351 --> 01:04:07,325
Hang on...
I'm just going to sit here for a minute.

1223
01:04:08,932 --> 01:04:10,487
It's okay, Uee.
It's not because of you.

1224
01:04:10,869 --> 01:04:12,072
It's not because of you.

1225
01:04:12,073 --> 01:04:13,575
Isn't Jong Kook going to try?

1226
01:04:14,279 --> 01:04:17,683
[Orange Idiot Team-
Capable Idiot's attempt.]

1227
01:04:21,082 --> 01:04:22,677
I lost some weight.

1228
01:04:24,650 --> 01:04:29,648
[Sit up and down five times while
shouting out, 'Princess, your highness'.]

1229
01:04:29,649 --> 01:04:31,510
- Princess, your highness.
- Four.

1230
01:04:31,510 --> 01:04:34,428
- Princess, your highness.
- Jong Kook is the best!

1231
01:04:34,463 --> 01:04:36,708
- Princess, your highness.
- Jong Kook is the best!

1232
01:04:37,224 --> 01:04:39,571
[Immediately moves over to the limbo bar.]

1233
01:04:39,572 --> 01:04:42,212
Your leg... stretch out your left leg.

1234
01:04:42,213 --> 01:04:44,854
[Carefully getting into position.]

1235
01:04:44,855 --> 01:04:47,008
I think you're going to do it.

1236
01:04:47,009 --> 01:04:48,276
Her arm is about to touch.

1237
01:04:48,277 --> 01:04:50,345
- Sa Yeon arm...
- It's about to touch her arm.

1238
01:04:50,346 --> 01:04:52,748
- Pull your arm out, Sa Yeon.
- No! Don't move that arm!

1239
01:04:52,749 --> 01:04:54,622
No, not that arm!

1240
01:04:55,698 --> 01:04:59,235
[He barely found the balance, but now
is about to crumble with her moving!]

1241
01:05:02,198 --> 01:05:03,560
Jong Kook, why are you
shaking like a leaf?

1242
01:05:05,066 --> 01:05:07,549
- Look at how you're shaking!
- I've never seen Jong Kook's legs tremble.

1243
01:05:07,550 --> 01:05:09,248
- I'm slipping.
- What is that?

1244
01:05:10,290 --> 01:05:13,532
[Orange Idiot Team - Fail.]

1245
01:05:13,854 --> 01:05:15,451
I've never seen you shake like that.

1246
01:05:16,147 --> 01:05:19,014
Sa Yeon makes even Jong Kook
shake in his shoes.

1247
01:05:19,015 --> 01:05:21,812
[Strong Sa Yeon making even
Mr. Capable tremble in his seat.]

1248
01:05:21,813 --> 01:05:23,363
- The feeling I got...
- That was so close.

1249
01:05:23,364 --> 01:05:24,955
We're going to make our attempt.

1250
01:05:24,956 --> 01:05:27,910
[Blue Idiot Team switches out
the player to Idiot Gary.]

1251

[Monday Couple continues on after
succeeding the biscuit challenge.]

1252
01:05:33,428 --> 01:05:35,046
- This is the lover's game.
- Okay...

1253
01:05:35,047 --> 01:05:37,018
- Did you loosen up?
- I'm ready.

1254
01:05:39,412 --> 01:05:41,872
I seriously...
I wonder if I'll be strong enough.

1255
01:05:45,660 --> 01:05:46,932
Ji Hyo...

1256
01:05:46,933 --> 01:05:51,375
[Five times while shouting out,
'Princess, your highness'.]

1257
01:05:51,376 --> 01:05:54,366
- Princess, your highness...
- Look at Ji Hyo smiling.

1258
01:05:54,367 --> 01:05:55,948
- How many times was that?
- Five.

1259
01:05:55,949 --> 01:05:57,898
- It's limbo time.
- I think he can do it.

1260
01:05:58,722 --> 01:06:01,099
[Moving off to the limbo bar
without any hesitation.]

1261
01:06:02,214 --> 01:06:07,053
[Posing like something out of a movie,
and let's go!]

1262

[Easily passing through.]

1263
01:06:13,532 --> 01:06:16,242
Don't move. Stay just like that.
Stay real still.

1264
01:06:16,243 --> 01:06:17,882
- Your shoulder...
- Don't even say anything.

1265
01:06:18,392 --> 01:06:21,372
Just think... just think about
what you're having for dinner.

1266
01:06:24,626 --> 01:06:26,393
[Gary almost makes it through!]

1267

[Now all he has to do is shout out,
'All hail princess' as he gets back up!]

01:10:42,890 --> 01:10:45,806
[Uee attacks Sa Yeon's back!]

1330
01:10:46,754 --> 01:10:50,479
[In the battle between the princesses...
the idiots are suffering quite a bit.]

1331
01:10:54,888 --> 01:10:56,286
Jae Suk!
You have to move away!

1332
01:10:56,287 --> 01:10:58,464
<i>Jae Suk, you have to turn!</i>

1333
01:10:59,460 --> 01:11:01,234
[Princess Sa Yeon dismounted.]

1334
01:11:04,168 --> 01:11:05,888
What happened?

1335
01:11:05,889 --> 01:11:07,519
[Crumbling down in shambles
within moments.]

1336
01:11:08,389 --> 01:11:09,827
- Wait...
- What happened?

1337
01:11:10,657 --> 01:11:12,153
- Sa Yeon, why...
- Why did you fall off?

1338
01:11:12,154 --> 01:11:14,772
[A they pull off their blindfolds to look,
Sa Yeon is sitting in a heap on the floor.]

1339
01:11:16,698 --> 01:11:20,483
[There was a definite sound of something
crashing to the floor...]

1340
01:11:20,484 --> 01:11:21,682
I heard something fall to the ground.

1341
01:11:21,683 --> 01:11:26,263
[Time for Coach Kook's pointers.]

1342
01:11:26,263 --> 01:11:27,962
I'm seriously not just going to
let you get away with this.

1343
01:11:28,494 --> 01:11:31,843
[Idiot Big-nose being scolded worse than
he would be by a real boxing coach.]

1344
01:11:34,883 --> 01:11:36,849
Turn... Sa Yeon, turn your body a bit.

1345
01:11:36,850 --> 01:11:38,847
[Realistic practice with Coach Kook.]

1346
01:11:38,848 --> 01:11:40,547
You have to turn now.

1347
01:11:41,256 --> 01:11:43,756
[Getting ready to start off after
being severely coached on how to play.]

1348
01:11:44,749 --> 01:11:47,291
[First round reconvenes!]

1349
01:11:55,850 --> 01:11:59,001
[Suk Jin treated like an idiot for
having turned in the opposite direction.]

1350
01:12:01,065 --> 01:12:02,637
[Sees another chance!]

1351
01:12:02,638 --> 01:12:05,121
[Uee moves in!]

1352
01:12:05,122 --> 01:12:07,355
[To the front lines!]

1353
01:12:08,187 --> 01:12:11,040
[A golden opportunity!]

1354
01:12:15,188 --> 01:12:18,698
[Green Idiot Team strikes like lightening
as soon as they see an opportunity!]

1355
01:12:23,385 --> 01:12:26,739
[Princess Sa Yeon takes it out on
Big-nosed idiot for his mistake!]

1356
01:12:30,384 --> 01:12:33,780
[What a pathetic sight...]

1357
01:12:41,455 --> 01:12:45,706
That's not it... but when Sa Yeon told you to
turn, you presented her back to Uee!

1358
01:12:46,458 --> 01:12:49,167
It's been at least 30 years since
I've been grabbed by my hair.

1359
01:12:50,794 --> 01:12:55,481
[Orange Idiot Team. One of their
two name tags are eliminated!]

1360
01:12:56,434 --> 01:12:59,564
[Thus onto the second preliminary round!]

1361
01:12:59,565 --> 01:13:01,622
<i>Okay, put your blindfolds on.</i>

1362
01:13:06,226 --> 01:13:07,742
Jong Kook, this isn't our fight.

1363
01:13:08,651 --> 01:13:11,850
[Each team's idiots stepping up
to test the waters.]

1364
01:13:15,533 --> 01:13:18,031
- He's not even putting on his blindfold.
- It's okay, it's oaky.

1365
01:13:20,614 --> 01:13:23,118
[Giraffe provokes the Tiger.]

1366
01:13:24,133 --> 01:13:26,069
<i>Good, Kwang Soo...
that's good.</i>

1367
01:13:26,070 --> 01:13:28,764
- Kwang Soo, you better watch yourself.
- It's okay Kwang Soo. There are cameras.

1368
01:13:28,765 --> 01:13:31,677
[With all the cameras around,
it's safe to make his attempt?]

1369
01:13:31,678 --> 01:13:33,819
- You've got the cameras, Kwang Soo.
- Since we're just checking each other out...

1370
01:13:34,424 --> 01:13:39,482
[Orange Idiot Team's Jong Kook and Sa Yeon
vs. Green Idiot Team's Kwang Soo and Uee.]

1371
01:13:39,483 --> 01:13:40,684
<i>Okay, put on your blindfolds.</i>

1372
01:13:40,685 --> 01:13:42,862
We need to win this so that we
can move on to the final round.

1373
01:13:47,156 --> 01:13:51,773
[So you've got your blindfold on now?]

1374
01:13:51,774 --> 01:13:54,337
[Take that!]

1375
01:14:02,184 --> 01:14:06,618
[Even blindfolded,
Tiger is still a tiger!]

1376
01:14:06,618 --> 01:14:08,353
<i>Is there just no way?</i>

1377
01:14:08,354 --> 01:14:11,679
Just what does one have to do...
how can he ever be beaten?

1378
01:14:11,680 --> 01:14:14,967
The one chance at Jong Kook I'm
waiting for is his 70th birthday.

1379
01:14:16,775 --> 01:14:19,108
So I have to stay alive until then.

1380
01:14:19,915 --> 01:14:22,028
I'm living to see his 70th birthday party.

1381
01:14:23,653 --> 01:14:26,348
- I'm waiting for his 70th birthday.
- Even old, he'd still be scary.

1382
01:14:26,349 --> 01:14:28,995
Just what state will I be in when
Kim Jong Kook turns 70?

1383
01:14:28,996 --> 01:14:31,989
[Even when he turns 70,
we're guessing he'd still be all muscle.]

1384
01:14:31,990 --> 01:14:33,180
<i>Okay, Kwang Soo...</i>

1385
01:14:33,181 --> 01:14:36,799
[If the Orange Idiot Team loses again,
they're out of the competition!]

1386
01:14:37,456 --> 01:14:39,754
<i>Whatever you do,
you can't drop your princess.</i>

1387
01:14:39,755 --> 01:14:41,483
<i>Okay, round two!</i>

1388
01:14:41,484 --> 01:14:43,988
- To the right, right...
- Left! Turn to the left!

1389
01:14:45,474 --> 01:14:49,320
[Capable idiot definitely quicker
on his feet than Big-nosed idiot.]

1390
01:14:52,244 --> 01:14:56,250
[But the idiots are still suffering
just the same.]

1391
01:14:57,822 --> 01:15:00,773
[A bloody battle ensues once again
between the two princesses!]

1392
01:15:02,645 --> 01:15:04,611
Don't go... don't!
Move back.

1393
01:15:05,668 --> 01:15:10,823
[But the princesses and the idiots
are impressively working in sync.]

1394
01:15:18,798 --> 01:15:22,371
[The princesses have each other's
name tags in their grasp!]

1395
01:15:22,371 --> 01:15:27,218
[Who will get to it first?]

1396
01:15:34,279 --> 01:15:38,551
[Princess Uee of the Green Idiot's Team
moves in like lightning and rips it off!]

1397
01:15:40,123 --> 01:15:43,119
[Orange Idiot Team loses both their name tags
and is thus eliminated from the competition.]

1398
01:15:43,119 --> 01:15:46,697
[Green Idiot Team moves on
to the final round!]

1399
01:15:47,188 --> 01:15:48,842
- Uee!
- I miss you!

1400
01:15:48,843 --> 01:15:50,517
Oh my gosh, the whole thing ripped off!

1401
01:15:52,893 --> 01:15:54,402
<i>I ripped it all off.</i>

1402
01:15:57,008 --> 01:15:59,898
Can we just try it on our own?
Without getting on someone's back.

1403
01:16:01,052 --> 01:16:02,817
[Please have mercy on me!]

1404
01:16:02,818 --> 01:16:04,208
We can't?

1405
01:16:04,209 --> 01:16:08,570
[She would've been dead if I didn't
have to be on an idiot's back...]

1406
01:16:09,289 --> 01:16:13,428
[Green Idiot Team in final battle
with the Blue Idiot Team.]

1407
01:16:20,761 --> 01:16:26,871
[Will the Monday Couple be able to
dominate this race too?]

1408
01:16:28,223 --> 01:16:30,535
Just destroy the other team, okay?

1409
01:16:30,989 --> 01:16:33,635
Once this season is over,
you two can get married, okay?

1410
01:16:34,251 --> 01:16:36,715
You two can start dating for real, okay?

1411
01:16:36,716 --> 01:16:38,401
Get yourself together, okay?

1412
01:16:38,402 --> 01:16:42,726
Uee... we'll just leave those two to love,
and we'll take home the gold!

1413
01:16:43,135 --> 01:16:45,640
And then we can just leave them,
and never see them again!

1414
01:16:46,582 --> 01:16:48,627
And you don't really have to see
Kwang Soo again.

1415
01:16:48,628 --> 01:16:49,897
You can just see each other
on TV from now on.

1416
01:16:49,898 --> 01:16:53,819
[Let's win the gold together today, and
only see each other on TV starting tomorrow!]

1417
01:16:53,820 --> 01:16:56,318
It's just weird that you two haven't
dated at all in the past three years!

1418
01:16:56,319 --> 01:16:57,390
Don't worry about a thing.

1419
01:16:57,390 --> 01:16:59,086
Both the teams looks like
you're having a lot of fun.

1420
01:16:59,646 --> 01:17:01,782
You guys look like a father, mother,
and the boss.

1421
01:17:01,783 --> 01:17:04,992
This is my place...
and my parents came to visit me today.

1422
01:17:04,993 --> 01:17:07,277
But you look very young to have
a son his age.

1423
01:17:07,782 --> 01:17:10,626
[Too young to have a son his age?]

1424
01:17:12,637 --> 01:17:17,081
[Final round:
Kwang Soo and Uee vs. Gary and Ji Hyo.]

1425
01:17:17,082 --> 01:17:20,596
- Get your head on straight.
- How much is this event costing to watch?

1426
01:17:21,306 --> 01:17:22,731
<i>Okay, this is the final round.</i>

1427
01:17:23,648 --> 01:17:25,894
[At last, start!]

1428
01:17:25,895 --> 01:17:29,234
Left... no, Kwang Soo.
You're moving backwards right now.

1429
01:17:29,235 --> 01:17:30,986
Wait... waiting is a good thing.

1430
01:17:30,987 --> 01:17:32,678
Front... to the front, Gary.

1431
01:17:36,172 --> 01:17:41,416
[Princess Ji Hyo starting off by
training Giraffe idiot first?]

1432
01:17:41,417 --> 01:17:42,626
What is going on?

1433
01:17:44,064 --> 01:17:46,133
Scary, isn't she, Uee?
That's Song Ji Hyo.

1434
01:17:48,216 --> 01:17:51,608
[Counterattack!
Uee attacks Gary's headgear.]

1435
01:17:56,680 --> 01:17:59,598
[Finally, a battle between
the two princesses!]

1436
01:18:05,617 --> 01:18:06,860
Kwang Soo, turn!

1437
01:18:11,538 --> 01:18:13,741
Let go... just let go.

1438
01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:20,620
[But to let her down like that...]

1439
01:18:21,341 --> 01:18:22,904
I couldn't let you go.

1440
01:18:22,905 --> 01:18:24,760
- I couldn't let you down like that.
- Ji Hyo...

1441
01:18:25,246 --> 01:18:28,554
You can see the old Ji Hyo coming out
to play right now, can't you?

1442
01:18:28,555 --> 01:18:31,125
Let go, let go right now, Kang Gary!
[The bully Ji Hyo?]

1443
01:18:31,126 --> 01:18:33,682
Let go... Let go, Kang Gary!

1444
01:18:34,096 --> 01:18:37,144
I thought my upper body was going to
break off from my lower body.

1445
01:18:37,364 --> 01:18:40,104
- Is the bully going to make an appearance?
- You should talk it out instead.

1446
01:18:40,105 --> 01:18:42,843
[You should just talk it out...]

1447
01:18:44,301 --> 01:18:46,789
This really looks like a battle
between lovers.

1448
01:18:47,135 --> 01:18:49,346
The game is starting to get
a little more heated.

1449
01:18:49,347 --> 01:18:52,777
[Final round reconvenes!]

1450
01:18:54,951 --> 01:18:56,763
- No, don't move!
- Your move earlier was pretty good.

1451
01:19:01,091 --> 01:19:04,446
[Ji Hyo once again tries her
training tactics on the Idiot Giraffe.]

1452
01:19:04,999 --> 01:19:06,897
[Ace not letting the Giraffe off easy!]

1453
01:19:06,898 --> 01:19:08,881
Ji Hyo really is something else.

1454
01:19:09,465 --> 01:19:11,757
Kwang Soo bit me!

1455
01:19:13,929 --> 01:19:15,305
Lee Kwang Soo!

1456
01:19:15,305 --> 01:19:18,339
[Carnivorous giraffe not letting
go of his meal.]

1457
01:19:19,257 --> 01:19:21,158
How dare you bite your older sister!

1458
01:19:21,159 --> 01:19:22,707
This is an entertaining final round!

1459
01:19:22,708 --> 01:19:24,657
- Uee! Fighting!
- Fighting!

1460
01:19:24,658 --> 01:19:27,673
[Full of energy and ferocity
just as a final round should be!]

1461
01:19:27,674 --> 01:19:29,759
- Concentrate.
- To the right... move to the right.

1462
01:19:30,963 --> 01:19:32,177
Kwang Soo, to the right a bit.

1463
01:19:32,178 --> 01:19:33,826
[Princess Uee directing in a calm manner.]

1464
01:19:33,827 --> 01:19:36,275
- Gary, to the right!
- Wait...

1465
01:19:36,276 --> 01:19:40,076
[Ace Ji Hyo moves in like lightening
to get a grasp on Uee's sleeve!]

1466
01:19:42,825 --> 01:19:46,812
[Uee not being able to use either of her
arms is in extreme danger!]

1467
01:19:48,120 --> 01:19:49,699
Turn... Gary, turn.

1468
01:19:49,700 --> 01:19:51,552
There she goes!

1469
01:19:55,663 --> 01:19:59,939
[Uee counterattacks with
Ji Hyo's name tag in her grasp!]

1470
01:19:59,939 --> 01:20:03,921
[In a blink of an eye, Ji Hyo also gets
Uee's name tag and attacks simultaneously!]

1471
01:20:03,921 --> 01:20:07,621
[Who'll be faster?]

1472
01:20:14,431 --> 01:20:18,742
[That's our Ace!
Blue Idiot Team's Princess Ji Hyo wins!]

1473
01:20:22,659 --> 01:20:25,693
[Awesome, Monday Couple!]

1474
01:20:26,147 --> 01:20:30,154
[The ultimate final round.
Current score is even at 1:1.]

1475
01:20:30,154 --> 01:20:34,872
[The fate of the victory
rests on this final round!]

1476
01:20:35,418 --> 01:20:40,991
[Green Idiot Team's Jae Suk and Uee vs.
Blue Idiot Team's Ha Ha and Ji Hyo.]

1477
01:20:40,991 --> 01:20:44,977
[One of these two teams will become
the ultimate Idiot General and Fair Princess!]

1478
01:20:46,671 --> 01:20:51,451
[The fateful final round - Start!]

1479
01:20:52,311 --> 01:20:53,701
- Hang on.
- Turn to the right.

1480
01:20:55,119 --> 01:20:57,917
[Princess Ji Hyo attacking as predicted.]

1481
01:21:01,831 --> 01:21:02,859
Turn to the left!

1482
01:21:02,859 --> 01:21:05,460
[The battle could come to an end
at any moment!]

1483
01:21:06,485 --> 01:21:08,161
- Jae Suk, to the left!
- Ha Ha, move!

1484
01:21:20,796 --> 01:21:25,093
[So close! Almost had it,
but falls down instead.]

1485
01:21:25,094 --> 01:21:27,428
What the heck is going on with me?

1486
01:21:28,707 --> 01:21:30,540
I'm supposed to be a princess today!

1487
01:21:31,209 --> 01:21:32,566
That's why we're the idiots.

1488
01:21:33,402 --> 01:21:38,026
[Now that we think about it,
the men are the idiots...]

1489
01:21:46,302 --> 01:21:50,064
[For one last time,
restart the final round!]

1490
01:21:52,185 --> 01:21:55,626
Okay, I'll guide you.
Jae Suk... to the left.

1491
01:21:56,272 --> 01:22:00,626
[Both teams are being more cautious
this time around.]

1492
01:22:05,111 --> 01:22:07,138
- To the left... go to the left.
- Almost there.

1493
01:22:07,139 --> 01:22:08,774
To the right... go to the right.

1494
01:22:09,222 --> 01:22:12,264
[The two princesses are at it!]

1495
01:22:12,264 --> 01:22:17,073
[Strength vs. strength!]

1496
01:22:18,606 --> 01:22:20,794
Jae Suk, take one step forward.

1497
01:22:20,795 --> 01:22:22,305
Just take one step forward.

1498
01:22:25,711 --> 01:22:28,475
[At the same time again!]

1499
01:22:34,795 --> 01:22:39,279
[Both start ripping it off
exactly at the same moment!]

1500
01:22:46,729 --> 01:22:51,054
[Unbelievable... Uee gets it first!]

1501
01:22:52,288 --> 01:22:58,271
[Green Idiot Team's Princess Uee wins!]

1502
01:23:00,978 --> 01:23:02,858
- She's not to be messed with.
- You're a champion, Uee!

1503
01:23:06,769 --> 01:23:08,586
<i>Yes, we won!</i>

1504
01:23:09,644 --> 01:23:14,665
<i>[The Fair Princess and the Green Idiot Team
finally wins the long drawn out battle.]</i>

1505
01:23:18,719 --> 01:23:23,958
<i>[In midst of all that happiness,
the fair princess was caught in a quandary.]</i>

1506
01:23:24,797 --> 01:23:29,557
<i>[Because she had to pick just one
idiot between her two idiots.]</i>

1507
01:23:31,006 --> 01:23:33,408
<i>Princess Uee can go on and
put her ring on first.</i>

1508
01:23:33,409 --> 01:23:35,593
[Princess Uee puts her ring on first...]

1509
01:23:35,594 --> 01:23:41,203
<i>And you can choose your idiot,
and put the ring on him yourself.</i>

1510
01:23:41,204 --> 01:23:43,485
[Who will she give the other ring to?]

1511
01:23:44,086 --> 01:23:46,607
- Jae Suk, no matter who she chooses...
- Of course!

1512
01:23:46,608 --> 01:23:48,864
- Let's be cool about this, okay?
- Of course, we will.

1513
01:23:48,865 --> 01:23:50,321
- Be happy for the winner?
- What else would we be?

1514
01:23:50,416 --> 01:23:51,728
Uee...

1515
01:23:55,075 --> 01:23:58,093
Why are you being like that?
This is an important moment for us!

1516
01:23:58,094 --> 01:24:00,300
Stop being so creepy,
and just stand still.

1517
01:24:00,301 --> 01:24:05,733
[Putting on what they think to be their most
attractive expression on their faces.]

1518
01:24:07,453 --> 01:24:10,237
[Who will be the ultimate Idiot General?]

1519
01:24:10,237 --> 01:24:13,704
[Who will Princess Uee choose?]

1520
01:24:17,437 --> 01:24:22,180
<i>[After thinking long and hard,
Princess Uee...]</i>

1521
01:24:25,581 --> 01:24:28,723
[Puts the gold ring on Idiot Kwang Soo!]

1522
01:24:28,723 --> 01:24:34,055
[The fair princess chooses idiot Kwang Soo!]

1523
01:24:35,121 --> 01:24:37,191
<i>What happened, Uee?</i>

1524
01:24:41,287 --> 01:24:48,006
<i>The fair princess... chose...
Idiot Giraffe...</i>

1525
01:24:50,282 --> 01:24:55,415
<i>[Idiot Kwang Soo and the Fair Princess who
became the fairest in the Running Kingdom...]</i>

1526
01:24:55,416 --> 01:24:58,155
<i>[lost their sight to greed over
the gold rings...]</i>

1527
01:24:58,155 --> 01:25:00,829
<i>[and soon went on their own
separate ways.]</i>

1528
01:25:03,463 --> 01:25:05,274
Mom...

1529
01:25:07,852 --> 01:25:09,992
This fairytale book is weird!
