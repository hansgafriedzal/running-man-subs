[Hot as his name states, Lee Kyung Gyu.]

[And the two actors challenging variety-
Kim In Gwon and Ryu Hyun Kyung.]

[Bringing tons of laughter to the show
with unpredictable energy.]

5
00:00:17,107 --> 00:00:18,971
[Sleek image of the big brother
kept hidden all this time until now.]

6
00:00:18,971 --> 00:00:21,040
[And the long awaited psychic karaoke room.]

7

[One fine day in April-
'D' shopping mall.]

12
00:00:38,075 --> 00:00:40,631
[Waiting for Running Man members
at that location...]

13
00:00:40,632 --> 00:00:43,557
[One mysterious man...]

<i>[Do they know what time it is?]</i>

15
00:00:50,024 --> 00:00:51,231
<i>Producer?</i>

16
00:00:53,004 --> 00:00:54,406
Sir!

17
00:00:54,979 --> 00:00:58,289
[The big brother of the variety world-
Lee Kyung Gyu.]

18
00:00:59,305 --> 00:01:01,800
- Hello!
- There you are!

19
00:01:01,801 --> 00:01:04,778
[Shocked from seeing a face
he could've never guessed seeing.]

20
00:01:04,779 --> 00:01:07,257
We're going to get to
go home early!

21
00:01:08,907 --> 00:01:10,193
Run, run!

22
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:12,088
Hurry up and run!

23
00:01:13,232 --> 00:01:14,962
- It's Kyung Gyu!
- Hurry!

24
00:01:15,856 --> 00:01:18,239
[Running up to greet his big brother.]

25
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:21,774
[The two giants of the variety world's
surprising meeting outdoors.]

26
00:01:21,775 --> 00:01:23,315
- Hurry! Hurry!
- What are you doing here?

27
00:01:23,316 --> 00:01:26,407
- Who's next?
- Hurry up!

28
00:01:26,408 --> 00:01:28,259
- Tell them to hurry!
- Ha Ha...

29
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:31,342
- Tell them all to come out together.
- Everyone together!

30
00:01:31,343 --> 00:01:33,627
- Tell them to come!
- Why are you coming out one by one?

31
00:01:33,628 --> 00:01:35,959
Tell everyone to come out now,
and let's get this over with.

32
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:39,129
Tell them to come quickly.
Run, run!

33
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:40,607
- Hurry up!
- Run!

34
00:01:41,078 --> 00:01:43,389
[Grabs the megaphone.]

35
00:01:45,258 --> 00:01:46,274
Hello, Sir!

36
00:01:46,274 --> 00:01:48,724
[Increasing their pace to lightning speed.]

37
00:01:48,856 --> 00:01:50,633
- Jong Kook!
- It's an honor!

38
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:54,270
- Suk Jin.
- Suk Jin...

39
00:01:54,271 --> 00:01:56,628
- Hurry up and get up here.
- We don't have much time!

40
00:01:56,629 --> 00:01:59,412
- Hurry up, Gary!
- Hello, fighting champion!

41
00:01:59,413 --> 00:02:01,878
Sir, my name is Kang Gary,
also known as the fighting champion!

42
00:02:03,068 --> 00:02:05,134
Stop doing stupid things,
and come over here.

43
00:02:05,976 --> 00:02:08,868
Suk Jin, Kyung Gyu hates
things like that.

44
00:02:08,869 --> 00:02:12,231
[Even the oldest on the show, Big-nose,
remains humble in front of Kyung Gyu.]

45
00:02:12,948 --> 00:02:16,354
- Ji Hyo!
- Hurry it up! Run faster!

46
00:02:19,068 --> 00:02:20,922
- Hello.
- Hello.

47
00:02:21,631 --> 00:02:24,920
I don't know if you're all aware of this,
but Lee Kyung Gyu...

48
00:02:24,921 --> 00:02:27,525
he's the icon of love and consideration.

49
00:02:27,526 --> 00:02:31,311
He really is a titan in the land of variety.

50
00:02:31,312 --> 00:02:32,942
[A titan in the
Korean variety show industry.]

51
00:02:32,943 --> 00:02:36,983
He's like a father to us whom we all
respect and love in our hearts.

52
00:02:36,984 --> 00:02:38,665
Lee Kyung Gyu has joined
our show today!

53
00:02:38,666 --> 00:02:42,042
[Eternal big brother of variety land,
Lee Kyung Gyu!]

54
00:02:42,043 --> 00:02:43,913
We can't leave out his name when
it comes to variety shows.

55
00:02:43,914 --> 00:02:46,962
With truly pure intentions...

56
00:02:46,963 --> 00:02:48,294
- With truly pure intentions...
- Yes?

57
00:02:48,295 --> 00:02:50,309
I have come on the show today
for the sake of Running Man.

58
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:52,270
- I have no other intentions.
- Why are you all laughing?

59
00:02:52,883 --> 00:02:57,029
[Did he really come on the show with the
sole intention of Running Man's benefit?]

60
00:02:57,836 --> 00:02:59,789
While on the show...

61
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:02,065
don't you think that I should at least
be able to beat this guy?

62
00:03:02,825 --> 00:03:04,024
I really think I can handle him.

63
00:03:04,025 --> 00:03:07,029
For the first time in a long while, a truly
worth adversary has joined us today.

64
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:08,930
[A worthy adversary for
the Big-nosed Brother?]

65
00:03:09,844 --> 00:03:12,647
I can take you out as easily as
snuffing out a candle.

66
00:03:13,168 --> 00:03:15,500
I see that you're wearing
tennis shoes today.

67
00:03:15,957 --> 00:03:17,235
Look at those shoes you're wearing.

68
00:03:17,236 --> 00:03:19,777
[Truly seems determined today...]

69
00:03:20,717 --> 00:03:21,974
I wore them since I'm making
an appearance on Running Man.

70
00:03:21,975 --> 00:03:23,254
But I think this is...

71
00:03:23,255 --> 00:03:27,463
the first time I've done an SBS Sunday
variety show with Kyung Gyu.

72
00:03:27,464 --> 00:03:28,609
- You're right.
- Isn't it?

73
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:30,278
This is my first time appearing on
an SBS weekend variety show.

74
00:03:30,279 --> 00:03:32,460
This really is your first time.
And when it comes to Lee Kyung Gyu...

75
00:03:32,461 --> 00:03:37,001
he really likes to listen in on
his juniors talking.

76
00:03:37,002 --> 00:03:38,457
But useless conversations...

77
00:03:39,193 --> 00:03:40,933
and anything that's not very
interesting...

78
00:03:40,934 --> 00:03:43,478
If that's what you're going to talk about,
it's better not to talk at all in his opinion.

79
00:03:43,479 --> 00:03:45,232
[Don't even think about things like that...]

80
00:03:45,233 --> 00:03:47,053
If it's not funny,
I don't react to it at all.

81
00:03:48,087 --> 00:03:51,667
[Big-brother's cut throat reaction.]

82
00:03:51,668 --> 00:03:55,444
Even though we've been hearing this often,
you are the icon of consideration...

83
00:03:55,445 --> 00:03:57,223
and you are also known as
the icon of love.

84
00:03:57,224 --> 00:04:00,468
What is it that we'll be doing with
our iconic brother, Lee Kyung Gyu today?

85
00:04:00,469 --> 00:04:01,952
How are the teams going
to be split up?

86
00:04:01,953 --> 00:04:04,270
<i>Senior Kyung Gyu...
do you have anything you'd like to say?</i>

87
00:04:04,271 --> 00:04:05,787
- Anything you'd like to say?
- Me?

88
00:04:05,788 --> 00:04:07,891
Well, you know, I...

89
00:04:07,892 --> 00:04:11,046
[Huh? Did he forget something?]

90
00:04:11,047 --> 00:04:12,943
- This is your first time on our show.
- Running Man is...

91
00:04:12,944 --> 00:04:15,222
- What would you like to say?
- Running Man is...

92
00:04:15,223 --> 00:04:18,004
Running Man has always been
one of my favorite shows...

93
00:04:18,005 --> 00:04:21,437
- I will do my best on the show today.
- Of course!

94
00:04:21,438 --> 00:04:24,943
[To say such nice things like that...]

95
00:04:24,944 --> 00:04:26,923
- What nice words!
- But...

96
00:04:26,924 --> 00:04:29,472
- What about the teams?
- We have to divide up the teams...

97
00:04:29,472 --> 00:04:31,741
How should we divide up the teams?
Are we evenly numbered?

98
00:04:31,742 --> 00:04:33,501
- I think there's an even number of members.
- Two, four...

99
00:04:33,502 --> 00:04:34,799
- Eight people.
- Perfectly numbered.

100
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,888
Don't you think that there should be
at least ten people?

101
00:04:38,023 --> 00:04:39,880
Did you bring some people
on the show with you today?

102
00:04:39,881 --> 00:04:42,062
- Who did you bring?
- Kyung Gyu, who did you bring with you?

103
00:04:42,063 --> 00:04:43,809
Did you bring someone with you?

104
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,725
- What?
- Did you bring others with you?

105
00:04:47,084 --> 00:04:49,072
Did you bring some other
actors on the show with you?

106
00:04:49,073 --> 00:04:50,935
You're not here for us?

107
00:04:51,417 --> 00:04:54,127
If we were to do the show
with some other actors...

108
00:04:54,128 --> 00:04:56,415
If we were to do the show with them,
wouldn't it be livelier?

109
00:04:56,416 --> 00:04:57,950
Of course, as long as it's fun,
it'll be great.

110
00:04:57,951 --> 00:05:01,571
- That's why I brought two actors with me.
- Who are they?

111
00:05:02,461 --> 00:05:04,262
Ryu Hyun Kyung and...

112
00:05:05,858 --> 00:05:08,717
- Kim In Gwon.
- Ryu Hyun Kyung and Kim In Gwon!

113
00:05:08,718 --> 00:05:12,191
[Because you need at least
ten people on the show?]

114
00:05:12,877 --> 00:05:15,871
[Kim In Gwon and Ryu Hyun Kyung.]

115
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:26,029
[Along with these two who are often seen on
the variety circuit with the Big-brother...]

116
00:05:27,173 --> 00:05:29,008
- In Gwon...
- Hello.

117
00:05:30,649 --> 00:05:34,446
[Everyone already looks
pretty chummy together?]

118
00:05:34,447 --> 00:05:38,427
[The two stars of a new movie that
Lee Kyung Gyu is producing at the moment.]

119
00:05:38,428 --> 00:05:40,694
Please welcome these two
on the show today.

120
00:05:40,695 --> 00:05:42,453
[Kim In Gwon and Ryu Hyun Kyung
also joining the show today.]

121
00:05:42,706 --> 00:05:45,194
- We all know each other then?
- Of course, we all know each other.

122
00:05:45,195 --> 00:05:47,755
- Then it's a good thing we came.
- This is really...

123
00:05:48,566 --> 00:05:51,339
- I was afraid you wouldn't know each other.
- We all know each other.

124
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:54,310
Seriously though,
how many years has it been?

125
00:05:54,311 --> 00:05:55,658
It's been about five to six years.

126
00:05:55,659 --> 00:05:58,160
[The first movie he's produced
in about five to six years.]

127
00:05:58,161 --> 00:06:00,779
I feel a little embarrassed to be
discussing my movie

128
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:02,306
so let's not talk about it.

129
00:06:02,307 --> 00:06:04,517
No, you should keep talking about it
since you're on the show today.

130
00:06:05,044 --> 00:06:08,071
But the way he said that...
it sounds like he was mocking me.

131
00:06:09,044 --> 00:06:12,266
When it was just me earlier,
I didn't feel so bashful.

132
00:06:12,267 --> 00:06:15,314
But now that these two are out here too,
I feel like I'm just here promoting the movie.

133
00:06:16,288 --> 00:06:17,864
You think?

134
00:06:17,865 --> 00:06:21,149
[Is the Big-brother really here
just for the sole benefit of Running Man?]

135
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:23,919
<i>I will announce the teams for the day.</i>

136
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:26,784
- We're going to be divided into two teams.
- Are we done talking about the movie now?

137
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:30,376
- You have something else to say?
- We still have a lot of time left today.

138
00:06:30,376 --> 00:06:32,074
[Is he disappointed?]

139
00:06:32,219 --> 00:06:34,612
So... how are we dividing up the teams?

140
00:06:34,613 --> 00:06:37,079
- The first team is... Lee Kyung Gyu...
- Yes?

141
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,745
- Yoo Jae Suk...
- Yes?

142
00:06:38,746 --> 00:06:43,161
<i>Ji Suk Jin, Song Ji Hyo, and
Lee Kwang Soo makes up one team.</i>

143
00:06:43,162 --> 00:06:44,919
[Lee Kyung Gyu, Yoo Jae Suk, Ji Suk Jin,
Song Ji Hyo and Lee Kwang Soo.]

144
00:06:45,306 --> 00:06:49,736
[And Jong Kook, In Gwon, Hyun Kyung,
Gary and Ha Ha.]

145
00:06:49,737 --> 00:06:52,639
Then what are you saying? Are you
saying that we're not young blood?

146
00:06:53,053 --> 00:06:55,034
We're young blood over here too.

147
00:06:55,035 --> 00:06:56,282
[Significantly younger team.]

148
00:06:56,282 --> 00:06:59,115
- By a stroke of luck today...
- Stroke of luck...

149
00:06:59,116 --> 00:07:01,346
<i>Our race today is,
Running Man Singing Race.</i>

150
00:07:01,347 --> 00:07:03,240
[Running Man Singing Race.]

151
00:07:03,241 --> 00:07:06,156
<i>Every time you pass a mission that will
be taking place in multiple locations...</i>

152
00:07:06,157 --> 00:07:08,675
<i>You will gain coins for a karaoke room.</i>

153
00:07:09,138 --> 00:07:12,949
<i>You will use those coins to challenge each
other at the final karaoke competition</i>

154
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:15,539
<i>and the team with the highest score will
become the ultimate winner.</i>

155
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:17,143
<i>Today's rules are very simple.</i>

156
00:07:18,038 --> 00:07:20,018
- Look at how happy Kyung Gyu looks.
- He looks so happy.

157
00:07:20,549 --> 00:07:23,175
- Does he like the race described?
- Yes, he really like things like that.

158
00:07:23,176 --> 00:07:26,159
[Seems extremely satisfied with
today's concept...]

159
00:07:28,663 --> 00:07:31,012
[Singing Race- Start!]

160
00:07:31,013 --> 00:07:33,425
We're heading off to the
sauna, Kyung Gyu.

161
00:07:33,426 --> 00:07:35,305
[On their way to the first location-
Sauna.]

162
00:07:35,306 --> 00:07:37,161
I wonder what we're going to do there?

163
00:07:37,485 --> 00:07:39,397
Thank you.
Have a good day.

164
00:07:40,843 --> 00:07:43,706
- Jong Kook has become so much more caring.
- Really?

165
00:07:44,513 --> 00:07:47,108
I have noticed that he's become
much more caring than he used to be.

166
00:07:48,828 --> 00:07:50,858
But if you mess up, it's over for you.

167
00:07:53,441 --> 00:07:58,599
[A formidable ally if on the same team,
but impregnable if on opposing sides.]

168
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,758
I know that Ji Hyo was up all night
shooting her new drama yesterday.

169
00:08:00,759 --> 00:08:04,253
[Blank Ji with her busy schedule lately.]

170
00:08:04,254 --> 00:08:06,242
- Her cheeks are...
- There's no life to them.

171
00:08:06,242 --> 00:08:07,786
[What is he saying?]

172
00:08:08,309 --> 00:08:10,096
- I think I'm starting to really age.
- Why?

173
00:08:10,097 --> 00:08:12,172
My dark circles are getting worse.

174
00:08:12,173 --> 00:08:15,796
- You can't fool time.
- Hey! Why do you keep saying all that?

175
00:08:15,796 --> 00:08:17,451
- Kwang Soo...
- Yes?

176
00:08:17,452 --> 00:08:19,495
I'm going to be 60 years old
any day now.

177
00:08:20,249 --> 00:08:21,564
I'm sorry.

178
00:08:22,087 --> 00:08:25,321
Kyung Gyu even remembers you
by name, Kwang Soo.

179
00:08:25,322 --> 00:08:29,025
- You should know that's an honor.
- I've seen Kwang Soo in movies...

180
00:08:29,614 --> 00:08:32,818
I know that Kwang Soo is extremely
popular in Thailand and Vietnam.

181
00:08:32,819 --> 00:08:36,173
[He even knows of his
popularity overseas?]

182
00:08:36,174 --> 00:08:38,555
I memorized the few basics before
I came on the show today.

183
00:08:39,082 --> 00:08:42,456
[This is the mentality of a variety titan.]

184
00:08:42,457 --> 00:08:44,879
What were you like in the past, Kyung Gyu?

185
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,153
Ugh... I wasn't the scary person
as everyone seems to think.

186
00:08:47,154 --> 00:08:49,018
- I've heard a lot of rumors.
- The rumors were wrong.

187
00:08:49,019 --> 00:08:51,944
- That's what I thought.
- That false rumor spread like wild fire.

188
00:08:51,945 --> 00:08:54,350
Rumors really can't be taken lightly,
you know that, right?

189
00:08:55,921 --> 00:09:00,917
Are there any misunderstandings that
you'd like to clear up for us right now?

190
00:09:00,918 --> 00:09:03,326
Here's one.
Rumor about me biting the writers.

191
00:09:03,327 --> 00:09:05,207
[Misunderstanding I-
'Making the writers cry every day.']

192
00:09:05,207 --> 00:09:07,334
The writers I work with these days...
they cry when we have to part ways.

193
00:09:07,335 --> 00:09:09,609
Because they're so upset that I'm leaving.

194
00:09:09,963 --> 00:09:11,805
[A knowing laugh?]

195
00:09:12,925 --> 00:09:14,822
They're so disappointed to
part ways with me.

196
00:09:14,823 --> 00:09:17,545
- That's how things are lately.
- I see, I see.

197
00:09:17,546 --> 00:09:20,137
Back in the day, if I was to
come walking down the hallway...

198
00:09:20,138 --> 00:09:23,014
like the parting of the Red Sea,
all the writers...

199
00:09:23,015 --> 00:09:25,115
they'd all split down the middle,
and stick themselves to the wall.

200
00:09:25,116 --> 00:09:27,062
[The writers would line themselves
up against the wall?]

201
00:09:27,063 --> 00:09:30,250
- I heard they threw salt at you?
- What are you talking about?

202
00:09:30,784 --> 00:09:32,268
- Kwang Soo...
- Yes?

203
00:09:32,465 --> 00:09:34,695
That bit about the salt wasn't right.

204
00:09:35,557 --> 00:09:40,099
I know that there were some rumors,
but I've never been pelted by any salt.

205
00:09:41,191 --> 00:09:44,242
But you've always...
been very good to me.

206
00:09:44,243 --> 00:09:46,267
- I think you've always been good to me.
- Of course, I was.

207
00:09:46,268 --> 00:09:50,469
- I try to be good to my juniors.
- You were always very good to me.

208
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,898
There are a few people
that I don't like though.

209
00:09:57,072 --> 00:09:58,773
I wonder how Park Myung Soo is doing?

210
00:09:59,177 --> 00:10:03,311
[Mr. Park Myung Soo...
he's asking how you're doing?]

211
00:10:04,284 --> 00:10:06,376
- Kyung Gyu, we're here.
- We're here?

212
00:10:06,377 --> 00:10:08,903
[Arrives at the mission location.]

213
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:12,235
['S' Waterpark in Youngdeungpyo.]

214
00:10:12,236 --> 00:10:16,685
<i>Your first race is three step sauna race
to win the coins.</i>

215
00:10:16,686 --> 00:10:20,074
<i>You will be playing a total of three games
with common items that you see at a sauna.</i>

216
00:10:20,075 --> 00:10:23,782
[Common items seen at a sauna-
Exfoliating towel, egg and fork.]

217
00:10:23,783 --> 00:10:27,108
<i>Neither age nor physique
will have any bearing on these games.</i>

218
00:10:27,109 --> 00:10:31,980
In Gwon used to be on a variety program
with us a long time ago.

219
00:10:31,981 --> 00:10:35,729
That variety program used to be
pretty popular back in the day.

220
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:39,446
And the first person to get eliminated
during those games was always In Gwon.

221
00:10:39,447 --> 00:10:41,455
[Was always the first to get eliminated
during the games.]

222
00:10:41,455 --> 00:10:44,758
[The image he acquired during the days
of the old program still remains with him.]

223
00:10:44,759 --> 00:10:47,131
He used to have a certain role that
he personified back then.

224
00:10:47,132 --> 00:10:49,401
He used to be like Kwang Soo
back in those days.

225
00:10:49,789 --> 00:10:54,221
He never got to show us his full potential
because he was the first to be eliminated.

226
00:10:54,222 --> 00:10:56,733
- Jae Suk tried to save him...
- Yes, he did try to save me.

227
00:10:56,734 --> 00:10:59,458
When he used to make In Gwon sing for
a chance to be saved from elimination

228
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:01,133
he would sing the song,
'The morning mist'.

229
00:11:01,134 --> 00:11:03,458
[The song he chose to sing was,
'The morning mist'.]

230
00:11:03,459 --> 00:11:05,935
[Even though it's a nice song,
I bet it wasn't very appropriate?]

231
00:11:05,936 --> 00:11:07,900
I really thought that he had
lost his mind.

232
00:11:13,907 --> 00:11:16,007
- I thought he'd sing a bright and happy song.
- I thought that too!

233
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:17,887
Even though that song is a very nice song...

234
00:11:17,888 --> 00:11:19,377
Any other person would sing something
happy and cheerful.

235
00:11:19,378 --> 00:11:21,503
He should've sang a happy song,
but the song he sang was depressing.

236
00:11:21,504 --> 00:11:23,802
- Tell us something about Hyun Kyung now.
- Hyun Kyung?

237
00:11:24,223 --> 00:11:27,237
- Hyun Kyung is...
- She's the female Gary!

238
00:11:27,238 --> 00:11:29,054
- You're right!
- She really is the female Gary.

239
00:11:29,055 --> 00:11:31,579
- I heard you two are close?
- She's the queen of festivals.

240
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:35,261
[Queen of festivals?]

241
00:11:35,262 --> 00:11:37,312
[Specializes in livening up
the club scene?]

242
00:11:37,313 --> 00:11:39,454
You know when most women dances
a sexy wave dance?

243
00:11:39,455 --> 00:11:41,567
She'd be dancing
a hip hop dance instead.

244
00:11:41,842 --> 00:11:45,516
[We may be able to verify that later...]

245
00:11:45,517 --> 00:11:47,963
I really can't stand seeing women
dancing like that.

246
00:11:48,937 --> 00:11:51,785
[Spitting out venomous words
as if he's been waiting for the moment.]

247
00:11:52,637 --> 00:11:54,559
Let's just get on with the games.

248
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,374
Have we been talking too much?

249
00:11:57,375 --> 00:11:59,473
<i>Since the Orange Team was
the first to arrive</i>

250
00:11:59,474 --> 00:12:03,038
<i>they can pick one of the items first,
and we will start off with that game.</i>

251
00:12:05,206 --> 00:12:06,804
- How about the exfoliating towel?
- Exfoliating towel?

252
00:12:06,805 --> 00:12:09,159
- Okay, the exfoliating towel.
- Exfoliating towel.

253
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,633
What's the exfoliating towel game?

254
00:12:11,005 --> 00:12:15,048
[The exfoliating towel game is...]

255
00:12:15,049 --> 00:12:16,232
Is it the tug-of-war game?

256
00:12:16,233 --> 00:12:19,081
The game we'll be playing with the
towel is the wrestling game.

257
00:12:19,082 --> 00:12:21,466
[Exfoliating towel wrestling game.]

258
00:12:22,285 --> 00:12:25,448
<i>Wrap the towel around the waist
and pull your opponent</i>

259
00:12:25,448 --> 00:12:28,138
<i>and the team to lose their footing first
loses the game.</i>

260
00:12:28,309 --> 00:12:32,154
- From our team... In Gwon will start.
- Okay, let's start with In Gwon.

261
00:12:32,155 --> 00:12:34,347
- In Gwon!
- In Gwon!

262
00:12:35,417 --> 00:12:37,381
- Then as for us...
- I'll start.

263
00:12:37,382 --> 00:12:38,922
[Big-nosed Brother will start off
from the Orange Team.]

264
00:12:40,435 --> 00:12:42,491
Do you know how to play this?
Have you played this before?

265
00:12:42,492 --> 00:12:43,715
- This way?
- Have you played it before?

266
00:12:43,716 --> 00:12:45,412
- You have to wrap it the other way.
- The other way?

267
00:12:45,413 --> 00:12:47,650
- Seriously...
- In Gwon, In Gwon!

268
00:12:47,651 --> 00:12:49,977
- Is this too short?
- What are you doing?

269
00:12:49,978 --> 00:12:52,226
- In Gwon, In Gwon!
- This isn't right, is it?

270
00:12:52,227 --> 00:12:54,237
You're not doing this right, Suk Jin.

271
00:12:54,238 --> 00:12:56,484
[Coach Kook unable to withstand it any
longer, and steps in to interfere.]

272
00:12:56,485 --> 00:12:59,292
You have to put your foot our like this.
Turn this foot around.

273
00:12:59,293 --> 00:13:01,138
- What?
- In Gwon! Turn your foot around!

274
00:13:01,627 --> 00:13:03,459
- Like this!
- Ah, like this?

275
00:13:04,682 --> 00:13:06,478
If you do it like that,
Suk Jin's face won't show on screen.

276
00:13:06,479 --> 00:13:08,261
- What are you doing?
- What?

277
00:13:08,262 --> 00:13:09,973
[Ah...]

278
00:13:09,974 --> 00:13:12,747
- That's how you're supposed to stand!
- Just turn your face around like this.

279
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:16,187
What if he's eliminated during his first try?

280
00:13:16,188 --> 00:13:19,086
- If one of your foot drops...
- No, when both of my feet drops.

281
00:13:19,087 --> 00:13:21,249
[Are they still trying to
figure out the rules?]

282
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:23,557
You're the culprit who's always
dragging out the filming, aren't you?

283
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:26,822
I can't help it that I'm in good shape.

284
00:13:26,823 --> 00:13:28,674
You talk so much!

285
00:13:28,675 --> 00:13:29,901
He's always talking nonstop.

286
00:13:29,902 --> 00:13:33,089
[Tiger's chatter grating on
Big-brother's nerves.]

287
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:35,725
- His chatter...
- I'm sorry, I'll keep it short.

288
00:13:35,726 --> 00:13:39,086
- Isn't this how we're supposed to do it?
- That's not how you're supposed to do it!

289
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:42,113
[Big-brother explodes.]

290
00:13:44,925 --> 00:13:46,325
Don't even play it!

291
00:13:47,352 --> 00:13:49,015
Why do you talk so much?

292
00:13:49,016 --> 00:13:50,901
Just do it!

293
00:13:53,339 --> 00:13:55,049
- Okay.
- Here we go.

294
00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:56,183
In Gwon...

295
00:13:56,183 --> 00:13:58,097
I'm not going easy on you, okay?

296
00:13:59,596 --> 00:14:01,896
Ready... set, go!

297
00:14:01,897 --> 00:14:03,419
[Start]

298
00:14:05,752 --> 00:14:07,436
[One move, and he loses.]

299
00:14:09,147 --> 00:14:13,070
[Takes ten minutes to prepare for the game,
and In Gwon wins in less than one second.]

300
00:14:13,071 --> 00:14:14,759
- In Gwon!
- In Gwon wins!

301
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,035
- In Gwon!
- In Gwon!

302
00:14:16,036 --> 00:14:18,956
[Getting more weaker and
useless by the day.]

303
00:14:19,385 --> 00:14:20,688
He's good.

304
00:14:20,689 --> 00:14:21,744
You stand over here.

305
00:14:21,745 --> 00:14:24,795
[Kyung Gyu taking over the spot
where he'll be most visible.]

306
00:14:24,796 --> 00:14:26,867
[Knows how to utilize the camera...]

307
00:14:26,868 --> 00:14:29,180
That spot doesn't allow for
proper stance with your legs.

308
00:14:29,181 --> 00:14:30,557
His comedic sense truly is...

309
00:14:30,558 --> 00:14:32,612
His legs looks like a white person's legs.

310
00:14:32,965 --> 00:14:34,734
[White as snow.]

311
00:14:34,735 --> 00:14:36,508
Like a white person's legs...
like a white woman's legs.

312
00:14:36,509 --> 00:14:38,332
How are his legs so white?

313
00:14:38,333 --> 00:14:40,265
[In Gwon vs. Kyung Gyu - Start.]

314
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:47,291
[Quick hand moves!]

315
00:14:47,292 --> 00:14:49,845
[You've still got it, Kyung Gyu...]

316
00:14:51,798 --> 00:14:53,905
- Didn't he used to do martial arts?
- You've still got it, Kyung Gyu!

317
00:14:53,906 --> 00:14:55,696
Kyung Gyu used to practice Kung Fu.

318
00:14:55,697 --> 00:14:57,845
You have to watch out for
In Gwon's moves.

319
00:14:57,846 --> 00:14:58,864
This move In Gwon does...

320
00:15:01,247 --> 00:15:04,327
[Big-brother's sudden power!]

321
00:15:05,511 --> 00:15:07,301
- How did he do that?
- Wow... how did that happen?

322
00:15:07,302 --> 00:15:09,322
[See that?]

323
00:15:11,502 --> 00:15:14,530
[Seems as though his
martial arts skills aren't dead yet!]

324
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:17,469
- Next up is...
- You have to watch out for him.

325
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:19,823
- Next up is... Ha Ha? How about Ha Ha?
- Hyun Kyung.

326
00:15:21,392 --> 00:15:23,612
[It seems as though he's targeting the two
people that he's feeling confident about.]

327
00:15:23,612 --> 00:15:26,794
Why can't I do that?
Why... why isn't she allowed?

328
00:15:26,795 --> 00:15:28,437
Are you making your pick?

329
00:15:28,438 --> 00:15:30,736
I'm on a roll here.

330
00:15:32,518 --> 00:15:35,040
[Kkuk taking the challenge.]

331
00:15:37,016 --> 00:15:38,730
- Okay, let's do this.
- Don't get nervous, Kyung Gyu.

332
00:15:39,736 --> 00:15:42,845
[Competition between strength
and experience?]

333
00:15:42,846 --> 00:15:45,306
- This isn't about strength, but it's skills.
- But he already feels...

334
00:15:45,307 --> 00:15:46,857
Don't worry.

335
00:15:49,436 --> 00:15:51,092
They're finally going at it.

336
00:15:51,571 --> 00:15:53,897
The two who are angry 24-7...

337
00:15:53,898 --> 00:15:55,652
[A battle between two men who are
always constantly getting angry.]

338
00:15:55,652 --> 00:15:57,034
A battle of wills!

339
00:15:57,035 --> 00:15:59,848
I heard that he used to practice martial arts
and I can feel the difference.

340
00:15:59,849 --> 00:16:01,525
[Feeling the difference in
Kyung Gyu's strength?]

341
00:16:01,526 --> 00:16:03,044
[Oh... even taking off his glasses?]

342
00:16:04,098 --> 00:16:06,826
- Can you see without your glasses?
- Don't take this so seriously!

343
00:16:06,827 --> 00:16:08,685
I want a spot on the show.

344
00:16:09,455 --> 00:16:11,765
[Ah... really?]

345
00:16:14,583 --> 00:16:19,250
You know what's coming, don't you?
Just concentrate on your singing career.

346
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:23,888
[Big-brother's confidence about
getting his Sunday night variety spot back?]

347
00:16:23,889 --> 00:16:25,799
You're playing around too much.

348
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:28,289
- You've been doing it for 7-8 years already.
- I'm sorry.

349
00:16:29,417 --> 00:16:30,703
- Shall I go?
- Go ahead.

350
00:16:36,529 --> 00:16:38,929
[The exfoliating towel not even budging.]

351
00:16:44,787 --> 00:16:46,580
<i>Is there a need to go this far?</i>

352
00:16:48,255 --> 00:16:49,822
He's doing really well.

353
00:16:49,823 --> 00:16:53,538
[His waist is staying alert
to stay in the game.]

354
00:16:53,539 --> 00:16:55,519
He's good!
Look at the way he's playing!

355
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,681
He's not joking around.

356
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:59,811
[I will show you all!]

357
00:17:00,929 --> 00:17:04,964
[Kyung Gyu enduring it with
a dignified stance.]

358
00:17:04,964 --> 00:17:07,387
This isn't being played purely
with strength.

359
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:13,609
[Jong Kook wins...]

360
00:17:16,524 --> 00:17:18,702
I thought you were showing us
a ballet move!

361
00:17:21,489 --> 00:17:25,425
[Like a swan taking a tragic fall...]

362
00:17:25,426 --> 00:17:29,084
[Both of his white legs falls out
of their stance and he loses...]

363
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,771
I thought you were doing ballet!

364
00:17:33,573 --> 00:17:36,069
- Did you have to win that badly?
- Jong Kook, seriously...

365
00:17:37,167 --> 00:17:38,406
Kwang Soo!

366
00:17:38,407 --> 00:17:41,205
[Next up is a tiger attacking giraffe.]

367
00:17:41,206 --> 00:17:42,966
- Kwang Soo...
- Move over!

368
00:17:44,131 --> 00:17:45,936
Are we going to keep switching spots
back and forth like this?

369
00:17:45,937 --> 00:17:48,189
- Here.
- Your arms are much longer, Kwang Soo.

370
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:49,933
Just hold it and stand still.
No, just let go for now.

371
00:17:49,934 --> 00:17:51,352
[Trying to make Kwang Soo suffer
as much as he had to take earlier?]

372
00:17:51,353 --> 00:17:53,057
[Just why...]

373
00:17:53,058 --> 00:17:54,793
Why does he have to grab it like that?

374
00:17:54,794 --> 00:17:56,624
Who says he has to grab it like that?

375
00:17:56,625 --> 00:18:00,055
- Why are you making him grab it like that?
- He should just grab it as I hand it to him.

376
00:18:00,745 --> 00:18:02,377
You've got a bad demeanor, don't you?

377
00:18:05,265 --> 00:18:06,582
Your right foot!

378
00:18:06,583 --> 00:18:08,940
[Keeps taking out his aggravations
out on Kwang Soo.]

379
00:18:08,941 --> 00:18:10,282
Let's move over to the middle.

380
00:18:10,751 --> 00:18:11,958
Ready...

381
00:18:12,331 --> 00:18:13,468
set, go!

382
00:18:16,054 --> 00:18:17,631
That's the way to do it, Kwang Soo.

383
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:23,158
[Playing around leading him to defeat.]

384
00:18:23,159 --> 00:18:25,352
- This is how you play it?
- You have to pull back, Kwang Soo.

385
00:18:25,353 --> 00:18:27,084
Kwang Soo just told you
that you're hurting him.

386
00:18:27,805 --> 00:18:29,870
Your opponent is telling you
that you're hurting him!

387
00:18:29,871 --> 00:18:31,509
Seriously... it really hurts.

388
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:32,974
How can you be so uncaring?

389
00:18:32,975 --> 00:18:35,662
Take a little break,
and I'll teach him a lesson.

390
00:18:37,883 --> 00:18:41,094
[Kyung Gyu's original image
is making a comeback.]

391
00:18:41,095 --> 00:18:43,193
- Finally, Lee Kyung Gyu is back!
- Lee Kyung Gyu!

392
00:18:43,194 --> 00:18:45,748
- Kyung Gyu is back!
- He just told you that he's hurting!

393
00:18:45,749 --> 00:18:47,328
- It really did hurt.
- Let's do it again.

394
00:18:47,329 --> 00:18:48,799
Are you his parent or something?

395
00:18:49,739 --> 00:18:52,110
No one can stop him now.
If he says do it again, then do it again.

396
00:18:52,111 --> 00:18:54,716
[Restarting the competition.]

397
00:18:54,717 --> 00:18:55,828
Set, go!

398
00:18:58,286 --> 00:18:59,468
Not bad, you might have a chance.

399
00:18:59,469 --> 00:19:00,479
Kwang Soo...

400
00:19:01,151 --> 00:19:02,666
- It hurts.
- What are you doing?

401
00:19:02,667 --> 00:19:04,045
- It hurts.
- Huh?

402
00:19:04,046 --> 00:19:05,425
- It hurts.
- Just do it.

403
00:19:06,767 --> 00:19:09,566
[Second chances are up to
the Big-brother's discretion.]

404
00:19:11,234 --> 00:19:13,435
It feels like I'm tied up to a tree.

405
00:19:13,436 --> 00:19:15,110
Kwang Soo, try pulling.

406
00:19:15,111 --> 00:19:17,506
Unravel it, and then pull it back.
There you go.

407
00:19:17,507 --> 00:19:18,857
Unravel it and pull it back.

408
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:24,730
[Giraffe's crumble from having
believed in his Big-brother.]

409
00:19:26,904 --> 00:19:28,283
Are you okay?

410
00:19:28,284 --> 00:19:30,202
- Get back to the line.
- My ears are ringing.

411
00:19:31,839 --> 00:19:33,714
[Jong Kook wins.]

412
00:19:33,715 --> 00:19:36,157
Maybe your inner ears are trying
to change the channel setting?

413
00:19:37,642 --> 00:19:40,078
[Exfoliating towel finalists:
Orange Team's Ji Hyo vs. Blue Team's Gary.]

414
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:42,030
- You again?
- Yeah, it's me!

415
00:19:43,085 --> 00:19:44,951
- You again?
- Come over this way.

416
00:19:44,952 --> 00:19:46,918
I'm not as strong as Jong Kook is.

417
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:48,072
- That's true.
- Why are you saying that?

418
00:19:48,381 --> 00:19:50,213
I know that you're known to be
quite the fighter.

419
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:53,301
I thought you said you were
a master in martial arts?

420
00:19:53,302 --> 00:19:56,700
- I thought that you said you were good?
- This is the highest I can even kick!

421
00:19:56,701 --> 00:19:58,804
- Then why did you tell us you were a master?
- How are you a master?

422
00:19:58,805 --> 00:20:00,511
[Kang Gary is rumored to be a
master of martial arts.]

423
00:20:00,512 --> 00:20:02,246
Third level. I have a third level belt
in the art of love.

424
00:20:03,791 --> 00:20:07,940
[He may not know about martial arts...
but a level three belt in the art of love?]

425
00:20:07,941 --> 00:20:09,527
- He's at least a level three.
- Level three in love?

426
00:20:09,984 --> 00:20:11,615
Level three in love...

427
00:20:11,616 --> 00:20:12,878
- Ready?
- Ready!

428
00:20:12,879 --> 00:20:14,324
- How do I do this?
- Ready, set, go!

429
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:20,076
Are we playing hard to get here?

430
00:20:20,717 --> 00:20:22,326
Is that what we're doing?

431
00:20:22,327 --> 00:20:25,966
[Level three Gary having changed the game
to a form of love foreplay.]

432
00:20:25,967 --> 00:20:28,135
You guys are seriously...

433
00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:33,292
[Is this a form of a hard-to-get scene that
one would see being played out at a club?]

434
00:20:35,157 --> 00:20:37,524
- That's nice.
- You guys do make a nice picture.

435
00:20:37,524 --> 00:20:39,449
These two seriously...

436
00:20:40,869 --> 00:20:42,381
I'm sorry, Ji Hyo.
I have no other choice.

437
00:20:46,161 --> 00:20:48,415
- She's pretty good.
- Ji Hyo's no easy target.

438
00:20:48,416 --> 00:20:50,872
- Is she putting up a good fight?
- Of course, she is.

439

[Blank Ji's sudden counterattack!]

[Blank Ji wins.]

441
00:21:10,378 --> 00:21:12,706
- Did that really happen?
- I'm good at martial arts!

442
00:21:14,656 --> 00:21:17,570
- That was seriously...
- Wow...

443
00:21:19,453 --> 00:21:22,929
[Orange Team wins the first round!]

444
00:21:24,091 --> 00:21:27,542
<i>There are two other items left.
There's the egg and the fork.</i>

445
00:21:27,543 --> 00:21:28,749
- What do you want to do?
- How about the egg?

446
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:29,866
- Egg.
- We'll do the egg.

447
00:21:30,772 --> 00:21:33,577
[Next up is the egg game.]

448
00:21:33,778 --> 00:21:36,236
<i>The next game up for the
three round sauna game is...</i>

449
00:21:36,237 --> 00:21:38,869
<i>It's the egg eating game.</i>

450
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:40,672
You will find that there's a tray
of eggs set out before you.

451
00:21:40,673 --> 00:21:44,678
Amongst them... there is one raw egg.

452
00:21:44,679 --> 00:21:50,183
[Just one out of the 30 eggs
on the tray is a raw egg.]

453
00:21:50,184 --> 00:21:53,131
<i>The team that chooses the raw egg
loses the game.</i>

454
00:21:53,132 --> 00:21:55,949
[Will take turns to crack open an egg,
and the team that chooses the raw egg loses.]

455
00:21:55,950 --> 00:21:57,517
- It's a very simple game.
- This sounds like fun!

456
00:21:58,324 --> 00:22:01,384
[A simple yet a nerve-wrecking game.]

457
00:22:02,641 --> 00:22:05,438
[Even if the hand grazes the egg,
that egg will be deemed chosen.]

458
00:22:05,439 --> 00:22:06,860
To be honest...

459
00:22:07,522 --> 00:22:09,334
I was in the chicken business
for ten years.

460
00:22:09,335 --> 00:22:12,613
[Kyung Gyu's deep history with chickens?]

461
00:22:12,614 --> 00:22:15,410
[Can tell just by looking?]

462
00:22:15,411 --> 00:22:17,817
I can tell if the egg is fertilized or not
just by looking at it.

463
00:22:18,622 --> 00:22:22,245
It's so easy for me to tell the difference
between a hardboiled egg and a raw egg.

464
00:22:22,246 --> 00:22:23,881
- I think I'll be able to tell too.
- I see it right there.

465
00:22:23,882 --> 00:22:25,874
- Where?
- There.

466
00:22:25,875 --> 00:22:28,110
- It's that one.
- Which one?

467
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:30,837
What's the difference between
the raw egg and the hardboiled egg?

468
00:22:30,838 --> 00:22:31,960
- Huh?
- What's the difference?

469
00:22:37,447 --> 00:22:39,316
- Hang on...
- Why?

470
00:22:40,033 --> 00:22:41,711
How many years have you
been doing this?

471
00:22:42,568 --> 00:22:45,116
How many years have you been doing this?
You're a funny kid.

472
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:49,036
Did you hear that?
Kyung Gyu told me that I'm funny.

473
00:22:50,658 --> 00:22:53,059
But I noticed that you don't speak
very harshly to Jae Suk.

474
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:55,054
- What?
- You don't speak harshly to him.

475
00:22:58,893 --> 00:23:01,780
[Immediate discomfort]

476
00:23:01,781 --> 00:23:03,421
What have I done wrong?

477
00:23:04,529 --> 00:23:07,504
[Grabbing him by the throat.]

478
00:23:07,505 --> 00:23:09,531
Why are you trying to grab me?
You should be grabbing him!

479
00:23:13,159 --> 00:23:15,609
Kyung Gyu!
You grabbed your foot with that hand!

480
00:23:17,108 --> 00:23:20,611
I already told you this earlier, but
Kyung Gyu's always been very kind to me.

481
00:23:20,611 --> 00:23:22,345
- I wonder why he favors you?
- Hey...

482
00:23:22,346 --> 00:23:23,521
Is it because of his popularity?

483
00:23:23,969 --> 00:23:26,839
It wouldn't be very nice of me to
like him just because of his popularity.

484
00:23:26,839 --> 00:23:29,213
I started liking him back
when he was still pretty anonymous.

485
00:23:29,213 --> 00:23:30,308
- Really?
- That's right.

486
00:23:30,308 --> 00:23:32,374
Did you know who I was even back
when I was anonymous?

487
00:23:35,847 --> 00:23:39,406
The Kyung Gyu I know doesn't like
people who aren't famous.

488
00:23:39,789 --> 00:23:41,327
Kyung Gyu!

489
00:23:41,328 --> 00:23:44,269
[Kyung Gyu's affection fluctuates
depending on the popularity level.]

490
00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:45,351
Seriously...

491
00:23:45,352 --> 00:23:46,501
How should we start the game?

492
00:23:46,502 --> 00:23:50,124
<i>Since you won the previous game,
you can decide who goes first.</i>

493
00:23:50,867 --> 00:23:52,967
- They can go.
- Let them go first?

494
00:23:53,473 --> 00:23:55,877
[Blue Team to pick the first egg.]

495
00:23:55,878 --> 00:23:57,941
We go back and forth taking turns, right?

496
00:23:57,942 --> 00:23:59,609
[Of the 30 eggs, only one is a raw egg.]

497
00:23:59,798 --> 00:24:02,206
- This is the one I choose.
- One in thirty chance?

498
00:24:02,903 --> 00:24:04,492
Come on, you have to hit it harder.

499
00:24:04,493 --> 00:24:06,173
[King of cry-babies.]

500
00:24:09,062 --> 00:24:10,927
You find this painful too?

501
00:24:12,848 --> 00:24:14,839
- You want me to do it for you?
- There you go.

502
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:17,008
- Forehead seems easiest.
- Enjoy your egg.

503
00:24:17,009 --> 00:24:18,538
- Miss Blank?
- Look very carefully.

504
00:24:18,539 --> 00:24:19,970
You have to look very closely.

505
00:24:19,971 --> 00:24:22,267
- There are 30 to choose from.
- Just choose one.

506
00:24:24,016 --> 00:24:25,761
- Break it on your forehead.
- Your forehead.

507
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:27,484
There you go.

508
00:24:28,182 --> 00:24:30,777
[Fearless Blank Ji's head butt.]

509
00:24:31,075 --> 00:24:32,653
What kind of a woman are you?

510
00:24:32,654 --> 00:24:36,249
- I didn't think it'd hurt like that.
- I can't believe the cracking sound it made.

511
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:39,879
Miss Song... she carries 80%
of this show.

512
00:24:40,489 --> 00:24:43,484
[In Gwon's turn.]

513
00:24:43,485 --> 00:24:45,760
- Once in a while, you...
- Why do you have that funny expression?

514
00:24:45,761 --> 00:24:48,211
[Once chosen, can't switch out!]

515
00:24:48,212 --> 00:24:49,825
- You have to keep that one!
- You can't switch it out!

516
00:24:49,826 --> 00:24:51,716
- Do it on your forehead.
- Do it right.

517
00:24:52,658 --> 00:24:54,424
[Lucky! Pass.]

518
00:24:54,425 --> 00:24:55,845
You scared me.

519
00:24:55,846 --> 00:24:58,352
Why are you all so afraid of this?

520
00:24:58,353 --> 00:25:01,274
If that egg had turned out to be raw,
that would've been classic variety material.

521
00:25:01,275 --> 00:25:02,809
- Kwang Soo!
- Kwang Soo!

522
00:25:02,810 --> 00:25:06,768
Kwang Soo, you think the god of variety
could be smiling down on you again?

523
00:25:06,769 --> 00:25:08,056
It was a hardboiled egg.

524
00:25:09,642 --> 00:25:12,579
[Sense of unease increasing as more
people pass one by one.]

525
00:25:13,585 --> 00:25:15,069
Ugh, that scared me for a moment.

526
00:25:15,859 --> 00:25:17,883
[Gary also passes.]

527
00:25:17,884 --> 00:25:20,220
- This is just pure luck.
- You can't think too hard about it.

528
00:25:20,221 --> 00:25:21,603
- I'm getting nervous.
- Okay.

529
00:25:21,604 --> 00:25:24,105
- Are you taking off your glasses?
- Okay, go ahead.

530
00:25:25,131 --> 00:25:26,640
[Big-nosed Brother passes.]

531
00:25:26,641 --> 00:25:28,724
- Do a wave.
- Don't pick the raw egg.

532
00:25:28,725 --> 00:25:30,578
- Just slam it on your head.
- Maybe we can win this one.

533
00:25:30,579 --> 00:25:32,389
[Pass. Hyun Kyung also
gets a hardboiled egg.]

534
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:34,960
- Kyung Gyu...
- Show us what you can do.

535
00:25:34,961 --> 00:25:36,802
Save our show for us, Kyung Gyu.

536
00:25:36,802 --> 00:25:39,459
Take a very close look, and
save the show for us, Kyung Gyu.

537
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:40,464
Kyung Gyu, do this for us.

538
00:25:40,465 --> 00:25:43,857
Let the egg yolk sit right between your
eyebrows and become your third eye.

539
00:25:43,858 --> 00:25:46,064
Please save our program today.

540
00:25:46,065 --> 00:25:48,570
Crack the egg so that the yolk looks like
your third eyeball on your forehead.

541
00:25:48,571 --> 00:25:51,673
- If I get the raw egg, we win?
- No, we lose.

542
00:25:51,674 --> 00:25:53,340
- We lose.
- Oh, we lose?

543
00:25:53,341 --> 00:25:55,415
- But that would make the show funny.
- We can't lose.

544
00:25:55,416 --> 00:25:56,653
That would make the show
very funny though.

545
00:25:57,194 --> 00:26:00,082
- What if that's raw?
- This is definitely a hardboiled egg.

546
00:26:00,083 --> 00:26:01,370
It's a given.

547
00:26:02,073 --> 00:26:03,837
[Immediately passes.]

548
00:26:05,252 --> 00:26:09,152
- I hope Kim Jong Kook gets it.
- Yeah. The way he's been behaving all day...

549
00:26:10,318 --> 00:26:12,773
[Been definitely pegged
as the least favorite.]

550
00:26:12,774 --> 00:26:14,619
- I'm just playing earnestly.
- What?

551
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:16,268
- I'm just playing earnestly.
- You're saying that's all it is?

552
00:26:16,269 --> 00:26:17,761
Watch the program and see if
that's all it is.

553
00:26:17,762 --> 00:26:20,678
You're more talk than anything else.

554
00:26:21,637 --> 00:26:24,497
[His no-nonsense straight talk.]

555
00:26:24,945 --> 00:26:27,098
Just pick one, pick it.

556
00:26:29,943 --> 00:26:33,242
- Get it, Kim Jong Kook.
- Just pick the raw egg.

557
00:26:33,243 --> 00:26:35,315
Just pick one!

558
00:26:37,518 --> 00:26:38,799
[Coach Kkuk also passes.]

559
00:26:40,317 --> 00:26:43,888
There's no need to start
worrying yet.

560
00:26:43,889 --> 00:26:45,416
- He always seems to get caught.
- I know.

561
00:26:45,417 --> 00:26:48,091
I doubt that.
It's not time for that yet.

562
00:26:48,469 --> 00:26:50,448
[Jae Suk also passes.]

563
00:26:50,868 --> 00:26:53,338
- Next up is...
- Dong Hoon.

564
00:26:53,339 --> 00:26:54,525
[Made one full round,
so there are 20 eggs left now.]

565
00:26:54,526 --> 00:26:56,900
- How many are there left?
- Ten of them are gone now.

566
00:26:56,901 --> 00:26:59,633
- Okay, here I go.
- It's okay. It's still okay.

567
00:27:01,383 --> 00:27:03,398
[Ro-Ro passes.]

568
00:27:04,752 --> 00:27:07,874
- I really hope Ji Hyo gets it.
- What did you say?

569
00:27:09,806 --> 00:27:12,357
- I bet it's the raw egg.
- No way.

570
00:27:12,358 --> 00:27:14,185
- I doubt it.
- It's not time for that yet.

571
00:27:14,186 --> 00:27:16,339
- I have a weird feeling about it.
- It's okay. Do it with confidence.

572
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:18,143
- That's such a relief!
- It hurts!

573
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:20,236
How come it sounds so loud
when you crack it?

574
00:27:20,237 --> 00:27:22,266
- Oh my...
- She must have a nice forehead.

575
00:27:22,267 --> 00:27:25,137
- Her forehead must be strong.
- You crack it so nicely.

576
00:27:25,138 --> 00:27:28,727
It sounds like she's cracking it
with a nail and hammer.

577
00:27:28,728 --> 00:27:31,917
- In Gwon...
- You have a nice forehead.

578
00:27:31,918 --> 00:27:33,665
[In Gwon's turn]

579
00:27:33,666 --> 00:27:35,798
- I bet it's In Gwon.
- In Gwon!

580
00:27:36,441 --> 00:27:38,388
[Safely passes again]

581
00:27:39,075 --> 00:27:40,657
I don't think it's going to be him.

582
00:27:40,658 --> 00:27:42,476
Kwang Soo usually gets things like this.

583
00:27:42,477 --> 00:27:44,929
- I still have a chance.
- He always gets things like this.

584
00:27:49,024 --> 00:27:51,093
[There it is!]

585
00:27:52,971 --> 00:27:56,652
[Shocked]

586
00:27:58,049 --> 00:28:01,461
[Why do things like this
always happen to Kwang Soo?]

587
00:28:01,462 --> 00:28:03,557
Things like this always
strangely happen to Kwang Soo.

588
00:28:03,558 --> 00:28:07,294
All the real comedic things happen to him.
Here, I'll massage it in for you.

589
00:28:07,295 --> 00:28:10,676
- It's just so weird!
- Kwang Soo, raw eggs are good for your skin.

590
00:28:10,677 --> 00:28:12,972
Maybe the variety gods
are looking down upon you.

591
00:28:13,345 --> 00:28:17,598
[Things like this and his popularity in
the Southeast are inexplicable.]

592
00:28:17,599 --> 00:28:20,787
- Did a staff member tell you?
- No, he didn't know.

593
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:23,996
[So uncanny that people are even
starting to suspect him.]

594
00:28:23,997 --> 00:28:25,615
What do you mean, you're jealous of me?

595
00:28:25,616 --> 00:28:28,219
This is something that anyone in
variety would want to happen to them.

596
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:29,541
No kidding!

597
00:28:29,962 --> 00:28:33,003
[The next round is-
One raw egg in a tray of 20 eggs.]

598
00:28:33,004 --> 00:28:35,846
<i>This time, instead of 30 eggs,
there are only 20.</i>

599
00:28:36,517 --> 00:28:39,412
Let's just count this as lunch,
and not waste time eating lunch.

600
00:28:39,413 --> 00:28:40,742
Okay.

601
00:28:40,743 --> 00:28:43,712
[Encouraging others not to waste time by
eating and dragging out the time any longer.]

602
00:28:44,412 --> 00:28:47,515
- Why bother eating lunch?
- He thinks this should be our lunch.

603
00:28:47,951 --> 00:28:50,558
We can end the shoot early,
and go out to eat something good.

604
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:53,445
What do you want to do by finishing early?
That's what I'm always so curious about.

605
00:28:53,446 --> 00:28:55,604
What do you always do by finishing
up the shoot early?

606
00:28:55,605 --> 00:28:57,392
Do you go home?

607
00:28:59,795 --> 00:29:02,735
- Your wife thinks you work late, right?
- She thinks you work until midnight?

608
00:29:02,736 --> 00:29:05,240
Most people usually thinks that I
shoot through the night until the morning.

609
00:29:06,412 --> 00:29:09,415
[Open talk show?]

610
00:29:09,416 --> 00:29:12,036
- We often shoot late into the night.
- You know it always happens.

611
00:29:12,037 --> 00:29:13,513
We'll start with Kwang Soo.

612
00:29:13,514 --> 00:29:15,513
- Okay.
- Start us off, Kwang Soo.

613
00:29:15,514 --> 00:29:17,748
- If you get it again this time...
- That would seriously be...

614
00:29:17,749 --> 00:29:19,775
- There's no way he'd get it.
- That would be crazy.

615
00:29:23,627 --> 00:29:26,598
[No way!]

616
00:29:26,599 --> 00:29:29,578
[The god of variety is smiling upon him.]

617
00:29:31,295 --> 00:29:35,755
[Even though we just witnessed the scene,
it's still hard to believe it happened!]

618
00:29:37,662 --> 00:29:39,197
Hey!
How can this be?

619
00:29:45,089 --> 00:29:48,009
[Truly shocking and astonishing.]

620
00:29:48,010 --> 00:29:49,432
Hey... that's unbelievable!

621
00:29:49,433 --> 00:29:53,521
[Of all the eggs out of 20,
the one he chooses happens to be...]

622
00:29:53,522 --> 00:29:55,588
The variety gods are smiling
down on you!

623
00:29:55,589 --> 00:29:57,541
If this was a match,
we'd have to throw in the towel.

624
00:30:00,074 --> 00:30:03,339
[Game two - Blue Team wins!]

625
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:07,321
[Streak of bad luck
that seems to know no end.]

626
00:30:07,322 --> 00:30:12,427
[Icon of bad luck...
his name is Giraffe.]

627
00:30:12,428 --> 00:30:14,763
How can you be so unlucky?

628
00:30:14,764 --> 00:30:17,522
No, he is lucky!
He is very lucky.

629
00:30:17,523 --> 00:30:20,542
If you look at it personally,
you have no luck. But on the variety side...

630
00:30:20,543 --> 00:30:21,821
[Giraffe ending the game in one blow.]

631
00:30:22,330 --> 00:30:25,196
- The gods are seriously looking out for you.
- The variety gods are helping you out.

632
00:30:25,197 --> 00:30:27,929
- Can't we still have our turn?
- I'll massage it in for you.

633
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:29,687
You should massage it in.
This is seriously...

634
00:30:29,688 --> 00:30:32,076
Since we don't get to play this often,
shouldn't we at least do it once more?

635
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:36,712
- Aren't we done with this game?
- Not fair that you get to do it all.

636
00:30:38,114 --> 00:30:39,978
What wrong have I done?

637
00:30:41,403 --> 00:30:43,756
What?
We're going to be done early?

638
00:30:44,321 --> 00:30:46,308
Even though I like that this game
ended so quick...

639
00:30:47,077 --> 00:30:49,003
Seriously... I'm not playing.

640
00:30:49,004 --> 00:30:51,284
- I'm not playing.
- Out of 20 eggs, how could he...

641
00:30:51,285 --> 00:30:53,204
Then we should move on
to the last game.

642
00:30:55,675 --> 00:30:57,691
What is the last game?
What are we playing?

643
00:30:57,692 --> 00:30:59,212
What is this?

644
00:30:59,213 --> 00:31:02,205
[It's a fork related game...]

645
00:31:02,206 --> 00:31:05,827
<i>The next game...
is the coin rolling game.</i>

646
00:31:05,828 --> 00:31:10,739
<i>You have to roll the coin to get it to
stick to the prongs in the fork.</i>

647
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:12,897
[Roll the coin to stick between the prongs.
First team to score three points wins.]

648
00:31:12,898 --> 00:31:15,196
You have to roll it to stick it
between the prongs.

649
00:31:15,197 --> 00:31:18,100
- I guess it's possible.
- I think you can roll it in between.

650
00:31:18,101 --> 00:31:22,262
All the games being played today are something
anyone can play as long as they're breathing.

651
00:31:22,916 --> 00:31:25,669
- What are you saying?
- How can you say it like that?

652
00:31:25,670 --> 00:31:28,201
How can you say that to my big brother?

653
00:31:28,202 --> 00:31:29,513
[Kkuk keeps on provoking Kyung Gyu.]

654
00:31:29,514 --> 00:31:31,825
- How can you say it in those words?
- I was talking about the game!

655
00:31:31,826 --> 00:31:33,316
Why are you just sitting there quietly,
Kyung Gyu?

656
00:31:33,317 --> 00:31:35,245
Are you saying that he's just
sitting here breathing right now?

657
00:31:35,246 --> 00:31:38,872
I was talking about the games.
I was describing how simple they are.

658
00:31:38,873 --> 00:31:41,257
To be honest,
just as Kyung Gyu said earlier...

659
00:31:41,258 --> 00:31:45,186
that with the movie release coming up,
he says he's unable to sleep these days.

660
00:31:45,187 --> 00:31:48,243
- He can't even sleep.
- I'm sure it'll be a success.

661
00:31:48,244 --> 00:31:51,910
Hey... stop sounding so condescending.

662
00:31:53,671 --> 00:31:56,537
- I just said it'll be successful!
- You sounded condescending.

663
00:31:57,213 --> 00:31:59,238
I was being very sincere!

664
00:31:59,239 --> 00:32:01,144
This was your expression when you said it.
'I'm sure it'll be successful.'

665
00:32:01,145 --> 00:32:02,455
[Getting angry at the insincere way
Kkuk made his comment.]

666
00:32:02,456 --> 00:32:04,292
- I didn't say it like that!
- Yes, you did!

667
00:32:04,293 --> 00:32:07,918
If you had said, 'You'll be successfully',
it would've been totally different!

668
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:10,907
- You really think that's the way I said it?
- Don't even talk about my movie around me.

669
00:32:10,908 --> 00:32:12,511
- Brother, that's not how I meant it.
- You...

670
00:32:12,512 --> 00:32:16,477
Don't call me your brother.
Save that for your real big brother at home.

671
00:32:21,166 --> 00:32:24,084
- You do as I tell you!
- You can call me 'mister' from now on.

672
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:26,211
Just call me 'mister'.

673
00:32:26,212 --> 00:32:28,884
What do you think you're doing?
Don't act like we're close.

674
00:32:31,542 --> 00:32:33,345
Don't you think this is hilarious?

675
00:32:33,346 --> 00:32:35,285
The way he just exploded like that?

676
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:41,818
I love things like this.
It feels really lively in here now.

677
00:32:41,819 --> 00:32:44,250
[A lively guest who refuses to be
treated like a guest on the show.]

678
00:32:44,965 --> 00:32:46,982
You are still the same as ever.

679
00:32:46,983 --> 00:32:48,778
- Seriously..
- Let's start rolling.

680
00:32:49,843 --> 00:32:50,824
- Let's start rolling.
- Okay.

681
00:32:50,825 --> 00:32:52,777
<i>I will give you all a moment to
practice first.</i>

682
00:32:52,778 --> 00:32:54,341
- Practice?
- Can we try it now?

683
00:32:55,969 --> 00:32:58,845
[Huh?]

684
00:33:01,165 --> 00:33:02,597
Mister!

685
00:33:02,598 --> 00:33:04,946
Why are you doing that?
Our team is trying to play.

686
00:33:05,361 --> 00:33:08,405
[Actively interfering with the
other team's practicing.]

687
00:33:09,449 --> 00:33:12,213
- I bet that's got to be really annoying.
- Mister!

688
00:33:13,647 --> 00:33:16,681
[Plans to interfere outright
to make them too upset to play.]

689
00:33:17,419 --> 00:33:19,909
When I was a younger, there was
this arcade by my house...

690
00:33:19,909 --> 00:33:25,601
and the owner of that arcade room
used to be kind of infuriating like this.

691
00:33:26,334 --> 00:33:29,383
- You know those mean store owners?
- And nothing was for free, right?

692
00:33:29,383 --> 00:33:30,895
- Over.
- Over?

693
00:33:30,896 --> 00:33:32,819
In Gwon, you go first.

694
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:33,933
Challenge.

695
00:33:34,662 --> 00:33:37,698
- In Gwon...
- You think you can do this, In Gwon?

696
00:33:37,699 --> 00:33:40,231
- Give it a try.
- I think I can do it.

697
00:33:40,232 --> 00:33:42,590
[Oh?
His throw is...]

698
00:33:47,828 --> 00:33:51,019
[The coin rolling at a super-fast speed!]

699
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:52,797
I bet if you aim it right,
it'll really get stuck there.

700
00:33:52,798 --> 00:33:55,343
[Will his throw make it?]

701
00:33:55,344 --> 00:33:57,002
[Ah, his throw is slightly off the mark.]

702
00:34:03,870 --> 00:34:06,163
[Ah... too bad!]

703
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:09,628
[In Gwon- Fail]

704
00:34:11,246 --> 00:34:13,744
Even though he has the skills,
the variety gods don't like him.

705
00:34:13,745 --> 00:34:14,918
[Even with his skills,
the gods aren't favoring him.]

706
00:34:16,027 --> 00:34:18,133
[Kkuk's turn.]

707
00:34:22,438 --> 00:34:24,660
That's the best you can do
with those arms of yours?

708
00:34:30,093 --> 00:34:31,960
[So close, yet fails!]

709
00:34:31,961 --> 00:34:34,449
- That was so close!
- What do we do?

710
00:34:34,450 --> 00:34:37,246
What's the point of having big arms?
Next!

711
00:34:38,057 --> 00:34:40,454
- It's because you're sitting up there.
- I agree.

712
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:42,658
[Say what?]

713
00:34:42,659 --> 00:34:45,763
[Fine then, I'll turn around.]

714
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:50,420
[The Big-brother's chic back turn?]

715
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:51,787
How's that?

716
00:34:53,092 --> 00:34:55,036
Ha Ha's usually pretty funny.

717
00:34:55,037 --> 00:34:56,857
[Ha Ha's turn]

718
00:34:59,819 --> 00:35:01,952
[Ah... so close!]

719
00:35:04,764 --> 00:35:06,164
- He's got it.
- He's got it!

720
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:11,010
[Another close call!]

721
00:35:11,011 --> 00:35:13,901
- Wow... I thought that was going to make it.
- It's not easy getting it in there.

722
00:35:13,902 --> 00:35:15,084
[Blue Team- Zero success.]

723
00:35:16,615 --> 00:35:18,748
[Orange Team's turn.]

724
00:35:19,001 --> 00:35:20,449
Like this, Ji Hyo.

725
00:35:20,450 --> 00:35:23,546
[Blank Ji takes the first turn.]

726
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:25,289
There you go, there you go!

727
00:35:25,918 --> 00:35:27,055
[Too bad...]

728
00:35:27,056 --> 00:35:28,234
Fail.

729
00:35:28,235 --> 00:35:30,269
[How will she do this time?]

730
00:35:31,015 --> 00:35:33,034
- There you go, there you go!
- Nice!

731
00:35:33,035 --> 00:35:36,163
[What!]

732
00:35:38,503 --> 00:35:41,595
[It went in!]

733
00:35:41,596 --> 00:35:43,603
[Amazing!]

734
00:35:48,307 --> 00:35:50,066
[An amazing woman...
she truly is our Blank Ji.]

735
00:35:50,067 --> 00:35:51,698
Wow...

736
00:35:53,053 --> 00:35:55,122
How does she do it?

737
00:35:55,544 --> 00:35:57,804
How can she be so good
at everything?

738
00:35:58,630 --> 00:36:01,748
Ji Hyo always does well,
but Kwang Soo always does bad.

739
00:36:01,749 --> 00:36:03,912
- You're right!
- She does well at everything.

740
00:36:03,913 --> 00:36:06,080
- We need both of them on this show.
- That's what I'm saying.

741
00:36:06,081 --> 00:36:09,459
So that's why the team they're on
never gets to win at anything.

742
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:12,649
They zero each other out.
She wins and he loses.

743
00:36:12,650 --> 00:36:14,060
Challenge.

744
00:36:14,061 --> 00:36:15,321
[Icon of bad luck, Kwang Soo's turn.]

745
00:36:15,322 --> 00:36:17,280
Kwang Soo's luck, he'd knock that out.

746
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:20,820
He'd totally have the comedic effect
of knocking it out of place.

747
00:36:20,821 --> 00:36:22,840
Kwang Soo would more than do that.

748
00:36:22,841 --> 00:36:24,152
You can do that.

749
00:36:25,431 --> 00:36:27,499
- I'll do it fast.
- You're doing good.

750
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:30,278
[Oh?]

751
00:36:32,776 --> 00:36:35,985
[Wow... Kwang Soo also succeeds!]

752
00:36:36,659 --> 00:36:39,473
[The variety gods must favor him...]

753
00:36:40,554 --> 00:36:42,358
We've got two now.

754
00:36:42,359 --> 00:36:43,659
[Orange Team with two successes already.]

755
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:45,238
Kyung Gyu it's your turn.

756
00:36:45,239 --> 00:36:47,070
Kyung Gyu's taking his turn,
so let's all be quiet.

757
00:36:50,142 --> 00:36:53,069
[Gets upset with everything that comes
out of Kkuk's mouth.]

758
00:36:53,070 --> 00:36:54,826
- Just be quiet!
- What did I say?

759
00:36:55,278 --> 00:36:58,308
- What? I was trying to help you!
- Just stay quiet!

760
00:36:58,309 --> 00:37:00,594
I know I told you not to say anything.

761
00:37:09,579 --> 00:37:14,311
- If you do this, your movie will be a hit.
- No, don't say things like that.

762
00:37:14,312 --> 00:37:15,915
Put the success of your
movie on the line.

763
00:37:16,451 --> 00:37:18,075
Don't say that.

764
00:37:19,194 --> 00:37:23,334
[Will Kyung Gyu...]

765
00:37:23,335 --> 00:37:26,860
[Oh my!]

766
00:37:28,133 --> 00:37:30,982
[It went in!]

767
00:37:35,335 --> 00:37:37,317
Mister!
It's going to be a hit!

768
00:37:38,028 --> 00:37:41,426
[Is this really a sign of a hit?]

769
00:37:54,744 --> 00:37:57,668
- Wow, that really was awesome.
- There are two 'Misters' in our country.

770
00:37:57,669 --> 00:37:59,372
Won Bin and Lee Kyung Gyu.

771
00:38:00,056 --> 00:38:01,803
Won Bin and Lee Kyung Gyu.

772
00:38:02,924 --> 00:38:05,697
And thus, our Orange Team wins!

773
00:38:05,698 --> 00:38:07,599
[Orange Team wins!]

774
00:38:09,676 --> 00:38:12,979
[The winning team can choose their coin.]

775
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:19,124
[Must choose between
the gold and the silver coin.]

776
00:38:19,125 --> 00:38:21,439
This is brighter.
This one looks more expensive.

777
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,440
With how shiny this one looks...

778
00:38:23,441 --> 00:38:26,584
it makes us think that we should be
taking this one, right?

779
00:38:26,585 --> 00:38:29,609
So since this one is shinier,
we should take this one, don't you think?

780
00:38:29,610 --> 00:38:34,200
- You're saying you want this one?
- Since this is shinier, we should take this.

781
00:38:34,201 --> 00:38:35,913
[The Orange Team ends up choosing
the shinier of the two, and takes the gold.]

782
00:38:35,997 --> 00:38:37,494
Okay, we'll take this one.

783
00:38:46,135 --> 00:38:49,261
[Seoul's 'E' Center in Sangamdong.]

784
00:38:50,726 --> 00:38:54,581
[What kind of a mission
awaits them this time?]

785
00:38:56,229 --> 00:38:58,436
Dodge ball is a real game.

786
00:38:59,396 --> 00:39:01,445
[A dodge ball game?]

787
00:39:02,817 --> 00:39:05,059
<i>Okay, here's your mission card.</i>

788
00:39:10,254 --> 00:39:13,159
- How is it those two go up together?
- They're always like that.

789
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:15,114
Stop following me around.
It's annoying.

790
00:39:15,115 --> 00:39:17,404
<i>[You lose if the ball hits the king.]</i>

791
00:39:17,405 --> 00:39:19,123
Then I guess Kyung Gyu will be the king?

792
00:39:20,247 --> 00:39:22,939
- Kyung Gyu...
- Since he's the king of variety...

793
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:24,687
Chairman of variety...
god of variety.

794
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:27,953
[Orange Team's god of variety
is Kyung Gyu?]

795
00:39:27,954 --> 00:39:30,397
[The king from each team will be
the oldest person on the team.]

796
00:39:30,398 --> 00:39:33,019
- Then you'd be the king.
- I usually get hit all the time.

797
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:36,489
<i>King of comedy and king of singing...</i>

798
00:39:36,490 --> 00:39:42,530
<i>So you two can be the kings,
and your servants can then protect you.</i>

799
00:39:42,531 --> 00:39:44,109
[The team members must
protect their king.]

800
00:39:44,110 --> 00:39:46,804
[If the king gets hit,
then the team loses.]

801
00:39:46,805 --> 00:39:48,287
- I like things like this.
- Being protected.

802
00:39:48,288 --> 00:39:50,957
[Big brother enjoying being protected
by his loyal subjects.]

803
00:39:50,958 --> 00:39:53,029
<i>The last protector left on the field
cannot be ousted.</i>

804
00:39:53,030 --> 00:39:55,124
<i>That person will remain to the end
to protect their king.</i>

805
00:39:55,125 --> 00:39:59,603
<i>We're going to play best out of three.
We need to decide who'll go first.</i>

806
00:39:59,604 --> 00:40:02,587
<i>Both teams needs to go stand
at the edge of your line.</i>

807
00:40:04,635 --> 00:40:08,064
<i>Okay, place the hat on your king's head.</i>

808
00:40:08,065 --> 00:40:11,447
I've never seen Kyung Gyu
wear a beanie hat.

809
00:40:12,190 --> 00:40:15,339
[A rare moment?]

810
00:40:19,895 --> 00:40:22,726
[Big brother being transformed
into a wooden match.]

811
00:40:24,262 --> 00:40:26,578
- You have to fold it over a little.
- Really?

812
00:40:26,579 --> 00:40:28,110
- Yes.
- Like this?

813
00:40:28,562 --> 00:40:31,310
Kyung Gyu's really holding
himself back right now.

814
00:40:31,311 --> 00:40:36,028
- Kyung Gyu's really changed!
- I told you that my personality's changed.

815
00:40:36,029 --> 00:40:38,558
If it was still back in the day,
he'd never put up with this.

816
00:40:38,916 --> 00:40:40,799
He'd be telling you not to bring it out.

817
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:43,155
- He would never have worn that.
- Because it's too much.

818
00:40:43,998 --> 00:40:48,753
[But somehow, he's been transformed
into an icon of love and consideration.]

819
00:40:51,071 --> 00:40:52,661
<i>Okay, ready...</i>

820
00:40:52,662 --> 00:40:55,436
<i>The team to grab
the ball first gets to attack.</i>

821
00:40:55,437 --> 00:40:56,542
<i>Ready...</i>

822
00:40:59,110 --> 00:41:01,661
[Giraffe from the Orange Team
was the fastest!]

823
00:41:02,377 --> 00:41:04,373
[Backtracking]

824
00:41:04,374 --> 00:41:07,587
- We've got it.
- It's okay, Dong Hoon. Next time.

825
00:41:07,588 --> 00:41:10,627
- There's no way I'd get hit in this spot.
- Even if the ball is thrown...

826
00:41:10,628 --> 00:41:13,146
Even when they throw the ball,
we'd be able to block it from you.

827
00:41:13,147 --> 00:41:14,897
Hit him directly.

828
00:41:18,453 --> 00:41:21,254
We have to line up.
Guard Kyung Gyu.

829
00:41:21,255 --> 00:41:22,406
[It's the Orange Team's turn
to play defense.]

830
00:41:26,849 --> 00:41:29,058
[Suk Jin - Out!]

831
00:41:33,455 --> 00:41:36,356
[Blue Team doing a good job
of escaping!]

832
00:41:41,483 --> 00:41:44,115
[As soon as he's ousted, he grabs
an out of bounds ball to attack!]

833
00:41:53,497 --> 00:41:55,427
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

834
00:41:55,787 --> 00:41:59,165
[So frail all of a sudden?]

835
00:42:00,203 --> 00:42:01,527
Be careful!

836
00:42:05,409 --> 00:42:07,693
[Jae Suk - Out!]

837
00:42:08,385 --> 00:42:09,844
One more.
There's one more.

838
00:42:11,124 --> 00:42:14,519
[As soon as the ball's in the other court,
the team immediately gets into shield mode.]

839
00:42:17,026 --> 00:42:18,252
[She caught it!]

840
00:42:19,095 --> 00:42:21,087
[She catches that fast throw!]

841
00:42:31,067 --> 00:42:33,461
- I can't believe it!
- Is she trying out for the Olympics?

842
00:42:33,462 --> 00:42:35,907
Why is she so good?
She's not even a dodge ball player.

843
00:42:35,908 --> 00:42:38,695
[Hyun Kyung showing
unexpected athletic skills.]

844
00:42:38,696 --> 00:42:40,551
That ball should've been ours!

845
00:42:40,552 --> 00:42:42,394
That's right!

846
00:42:42,395 --> 00:42:44,210
[In Gwon - Out!]

847
00:42:48,185 --> 00:42:50,422
[Hyun Kyung throwing the ball
with teeth gritted!]

848
00:42:54,132 --> 00:42:55,443
Watch out!

849
00:42:55,444 --> 00:42:56,919
Out!
Kwang Soo's out!

850
00:42:59,261 --> 00:43:01,605
[Just then, the Orange Team
falls into danger!]

851
00:43:07,324 --> 00:43:09,740
[If the king is hit,
the team loses immediately!]

852
00:43:10,103 --> 00:43:12,449
[Ji Hyo just barely manages to block it!]

853
00:43:12,450 --> 00:43:13,986
Kwang Soo's out!

854
00:43:14,967 --> 00:43:17,245
[A bloody battle to take over the ball!]

855
00:43:21,065 --> 00:43:22,386
Run!

856
00:43:22,387 --> 00:43:23,503
Who's out?

857
00:43:23,504 --> 00:43:26,932
<i>Ji Hyo was ousted first.
Kwang Soo must stay in the game.</i>

858
00:43:26,933 --> 00:43:29,082
[With the king being the only other one left,
Kwang Soo must now stay in the game.]

859
00:43:29,082 --> 00:43:30,423
Grab him!
Hurry up and get him!

860
00:43:30,424 --> 00:43:31,853
[Kyung Gyu in danger!]

861
00:43:33,257 --> 00:43:35,464
[Tough Hyung Kyung once again
gets ready to attack!]

862
00:43:36,473 --> 00:43:39,038
[She hit her mark?]

863
00:43:41,843 --> 00:43:43,192
What was that?

864
00:43:43,736 --> 00:43:47,030
[Hands over it to her teammate.]

865
00:43:47,620 --> 00:43:49,146
You have to stay back, Kyung Gyu.

866
00:43:49,147 --> 00:43:50,711
You have to stay back, Kyung Gyu.

867
00:43:52,267 --> 00:43:55,267
[Giraffe having become a
shield for Kyung Gyu.]

868
00:43:57,032 --> 00:43:58,899
[Beleaguered]

869
00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:02,241
[Fragile Kyung Gyu sticking close
behind Giraffe's back in hiding.]

870
00:44:02,242 --> 00:44:04,003
- Come this way.
- Pass the ball!

871
00:44:04,987 --> 00:44:06,119
There you go!

872
00:44:06,154 --> 00:44:07,850
[Giraffe steals the ball to attack!]

873
00:44:12,566 --> 00:44:14,777
[Hyun Kyung - Out!]

874
00:44:20,645 --> 00:44:22,787
[Kyung Gyu!]

875
00:44:25,537 --> 00:44:27,680
[Huh...]

876
00:44:28,234 --> 00:44:30,550
[Immediately falls into danger.]

877
00:44:30,998 --> 00:44:32,682
[Unbelievably passes over the ball.]

878
00:44:32,683 --> 00:44:34,823
[Throws his whole body
into escaping the ball.]

879
00:44:36,695 --> 00:44:38,864
[However...]

880
00:44:38,865 --> 00:44:42,052
[Will Kyung Gyu be ousted just like this?]

881
00:44:44,298 --> 00:44:46,581
[Giraffe hits the ball out of the way!]

882
00:44:46,582 --> 00:44:47,766
[Darn!]

883
00:44:48,567 --> 00:44:51,101
[King Kyung Gyu barely escaping danger!]

884
00:44:51,102 --> 00:44:52,578
Get up!

885
00:44:54,172 --> 00:44:56,496
[King Kyung Gyu escapes his danger.]

886
00:45:00,665 --> 00:45:02,121
Wait!
Time!

887
00:45:05,218 --> 00:45:08,009
[Depleted of energy]

888
00:45:08,010 --> 00:45:10,305
- I can't believe he escaped that.
- No!

889
00:45:10,306 --> 00:45:13,774
Kyung Gyu really looks like a
frail female lead in a movie.

890
00:45:13,775 --> 00:45:15,853
Can you get an ambulance ready for us?

891
00:45:16,607 --> 00:45:17,865
Here I go!

892
00:45:18,547 --> 00:45:20,346
Pass the ball around.

893
00:45:21,607 --> 00:45:24,847
[The Orange Team passing the ball around.]

894
00:45:26,765 --> 00:45:27,829
Pass the ball around.

895
00:45:27,829 --> 00:45:29,999
[Chance!]

896
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,485
[Succeeds in his attack!]

897
00:45:32,486 --> 00:45:35,420
[King Jong Kook- Out!]

898
00:45:36,140 --> 00:45:39,142
[Orange Team- 1; Blue Team- 0]

899
00:45:42,162 --> 00:45:44,648
It's okay.
It's okay.

900
00:45:44,649 --> 00:45:46,461
It's okay!

901
00:45:46,462 --> 00:45:49,036
- It's okay!
- Wait...

902
00:45:49,037 --> 00:45:51,685
Hyun Kyung, you're really athletic.

903
00:45:51,686 --> 00:45:54,942
You look like a real competitive athlete.

904
00:45:55,298 --> 00:45:57,892
[Unexpected shouts of battle cry.]

905
00:45:57,893 --> 00:45:59,646
I told you!
I told you that she was like that.

906
00:45:59,647 --> 00:46:02,257
- She looks like a real dodge ball player.
- Are you really athletic?

907
00:46:02,376 --> 00:46:05,405
- You've played this before, haven't you?
- I've never played dodge ball before.

908
00:46:05,406 --> 00:46:07,143
[On the other hand...]

909
00:46:09,061 --> 00:46:11,677
- What are you doing?
- Kyung Gyu's exhausted.

910
00:46:12,425 --> 00:46:14,764
[Exhausted King Kyung Gyu]

911
00:46:14,765 --> 00:46:18,101
- Seriously...
- The match is about to light up on fire.

912
00:46:18,102 --> 00:46:20,852
Once he's on fire, it's no joke!

913
00:46:20,853 --> 00:46:23,249
Once he really gets angry...

914
00:46:25,381 --> 00:46:26,618
Let's stop playing.

915
00:46:28,129 --> 00:46:30,842
[Kyung Gyu's chatter
has all of a sudden ceased.]

916
00:46:30,843 --> 00:46:37,125
I never knew... that Kyung Gyu was
so fragile or delicate.

917
00:46:37,126 --> 00:46:39,096
- He's just so...
- I never knew either.

918
00:46:39,501 --> 00:46:41,775
- You're like a little girl.
- You are like a little girl.

919
00:46:41,776 --> 00:46:43,129
We have to win!

920
00:46:43,130 --> 00:46:45,716
- We have to win.
- Fighting!

921
00:46:45,717 --> 00:46:47,818
[Second set- Start!]

922
00:46:49,260 --> 00:46:51,714
Okay, here we go.
Throw it hard!

923
00:46:51,715 --> 00:46:53,290
Throw it fast.

924
00:46:56,176 --> 00:46:59,231
[They all managed to avoid being hit!]

925
00:46:59,232 --> 00:47:01,784
Low balls are the scariest.

926
00:47:01,785 --> 00:47:03,107
[Fragile Kyung Gyu hanging on dearly.]

927
00:47:03,108 --> 00:47:04,966
Send Hyun Kyung out first.

928
00:47:04,967 --> 00:47:06,498
Send Hyun Kyung out first.

929
00:47:06,499 --> 00:47:08,741
[Oh?]

930
00:47:09,748 --> 00:47:13,378
[A knee kick from his own King Kkuk?]

931
00:47:13,379 --> 00:47:14,793
He got me in the butt with his knee.

932
00:47:15,508 --> 00:47:17,116
- You can do this.
- In Gwon!

933
00:47:18,928 --> 00:47:21,024
[Catches the ball again!]

934
00:47:23,509 --> 00:47:25,080
What was that?

935
00:47:25,081 --> 00:47:26,468
Kim Jong Kook...

936
00:47:28,749 --> 00:47:30,763
[Tough Hyung Kyung's fast throw.]

937
00:47:30,764 --> 00:47:33,288
Look at the way she's gritting her teeth!

938
00:47:37,076 --> 00:47:39,876
[Is it King Kkuk's turn?]

939
00:47:47,388 --> 00:47:50,198
[Kyung Gyu's legs giving out on him
with the Tiger's lightening throw.]

940
00:47:51,611 --> 00:47:53,529
Mister...
I'm sorry, Mister.

941
00:47:57,513 --> 00:47:59,639
[Everyone doing a good job
of avoiding the ball.]

942
00:48:00,193 --> 00:48:02,724
[Tough Hyun Kyung's turn again.]

943
00:48:07,638 --> 00:48:10,050
[Jae Suk - Out!]

944
00:48:10,051 --> 00:48:12,189
- He's out!
- I'm out.

945
00:48:12,190 --> 00:48:13,709
Catch the ball.
You can catch the ball.

946
00:48:13,710 --> 00:48:16,416
He's behind us.
Watch out, he's behind us.

947
00:48:17,512 --> 00:48:18,851
[Huh?]

948
00:48:18,852 --> 00:48:20,723
[It touched his hand...]

949
00:48:20,724 --> 00:48:22,258
- I'm out?
- You're out.

950
00:48:23,091 --> 00:48:25,645
- What are you doing?
- I was trying to catch it.

951
00:48:27,226 --> 00:48:29,402
[Oh!]

952
00:48:30,910 --> 00:48:33,938
[In Gwon losing his opportunity again.]

953
00:48:33,939 --> 00:48:35,528
Why are you so bad at this, In Gwon?

954
00:48:41,101 --> 00:48:43,023
[In Gwon - Out!]

955
00:48:43,024 --> 00:48:44,402
- Get Gary.
- Throw it low.

956
00:48:46,448 --> 00:48:49,579
- Gary...
- There you go! Gary, out!

957
00:48:49,580 --> 00:48:51,560
- Gary, out!
- Gary, get out!

958
00:48:52,393 --> 00:48:55,055
[In that case...]

959
00:48:55,056 --> 00:48:59,728
[Tough Hyun Kyung to
protect King Kkuk...]

960
00:48:59,729 --> 00:49:02,052
- You really are too much!
- That's not right!

961
00:49:02,053 --> 00:49:05,515
- How does that make any sense?
- Lets just end this right now.

962
00:49:05,516 --> 00:49:07,315
[As the king, Kkuk has no other choice...]

963
00:49:08,726 --> 00:49:10,916
[Danger!]

964
00:49:12,161 --> 00:49:15,086
[No!]

965
00:49:18,967 --> 00:49:21,639
[Guard Hyun Kyung doing
everything she can.]

966
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:23,831
Hyun Kyung!
You're going to have to take the hit!

967
00:49:23,832 --> 00:49:25,567
[Guarding her king!]

968
00:49:26,292 --> 00:49:28,566
[Oh!
She caught the ball!]

969
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,161
[Huh?]

970
00:49:34,828 --> 00:49:37,336
[After all her ferocious attacks...]

971
00:49:39,058 --> 00:49:41,611
- The ball is ours.
- Here!

972
00:49:41,612 --> 00:49:43,363
Don't throw the ball too carelessly!

973
00:49:43,364 --> 00:49:46,416
[With Hyun Kyung being a better guard than
expected, they must play the game better.]

974
00:49:46,417 --> 00:49:48,410
[King Kyung Gyu stepping in himself.]

975
00:49:51,427 --> 00:49:53,296
[Passes off the ball!]

976
00:49:55,017 --> 00:49:59,420
[With King Kyung Gyu's pass,
King Kkuk is in danger!]

977
00:49:59,421 --> 00:50:02,858
[Tough Hyung Kyung throwing her body
in to protect her king!]

978
00:50:06,638 --> 00:50:08,864
[Will she be able to block?]

979
00:50:14,616 --> 00:50:16,669
[King Jong Kook - Out!]

980
00:50:17,197 --> 00:50:20,162
[Orange Team wins!]

981
00:50:20,163 --> 00:50:23,099
- I'm so tired.
- You should've stuck closer to her.

982
00:50:23,100 --> 00:50:24,367
That was too bad.

983
00:50:25,104 --> 00:50:27,552
[Orange Team showing fantastic teamwork.]

984
00:50:27,553 --> 00:50:28,827
It's great.

985
00:50:29,690 --> 00:50:33,216
[Trying to integrate himself in
the team with every chance he sees.]

986
00:50:35,823 --> 00:50:39,384
- It's the same as before.
- Is it the gold and the silver coin again?

987
00:50:39,385 --> 00:50:42,655
[Gold and the silver coin once again.]

988
00:50:42,656 --> 00:50:44,296
You want to go with the same one?

989
00:50:44,297 --> 00:50:46,043
- That's what I was thinking. You?
- Sure.

990
00:50:46,044 --> 00:50:48,202
- What do you think?
- That sounds good.

991
00:50:49,299 --> 00:50:51,682
Don't you think you've
gotten too nice?

992
00:50:51,683 --> 00:50:53,336
Why are you asking him
for his opinion?

993
00:50:53,337 --> 00:50:55,396
You've become way too nice!

994
00:50:55,397 --> 00:50:58,165
- I just got goosebumps!
- What do you think?

995
00:50:58,166 --> 00:51:00,292
- I agree with you.
- I've never seen this before.

996
00:51:00,293 --> 00:51:02,305
- Should we go with this one?
- Let's stick to the same one.

997
00:51:02,306 --> 00:51:03,998
[Orange Team chooses the coin gold again.]

998
00:51:03,999 --> 00:51:06,379
Kyung Gyu... you've become so nice.

999
00:51:06,380 --> 00:51:09,894
- Same as the other one.
- The next location is right next to here.

1000
00:51:09,895 --> 00:51:12,485
It's right over there.
It's inside that building.

1001
00:51:12,486 --> 00:51:17,176
[The third mission location is
inside the Seoul Energy Dream Center.]

1002
00:51:17,177 --> 00:51:19,284
- What is this?
- Are we doing a race?

1003
00:51:19,285 --> 00:51:21,974
[Which mission waits for them inside?]

1004
00:51:24,123 --> 00:51:26,666
- Why is there a monitor?
- What is that?

1005
00:51:26,902 --> 00:51:31,287
[16 different split screens
on the monitor!]

1006
00:51:31,288 --> 00:51:33,555
<i>This is your last game before we
go into the final race...</i>

1007
00:51:33,556 --> 00:51:36,299
<i>It's the avatar one-on-one
name tag elimination.</i>

1008
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:37,803
Avatar?

1009
00:51:37,804 --> 00:51:40,643
<i>It's avatar one-on-one
name tag elimination.</i>

1010
00:51:41,616 --> 00:51:46,510
[Each team sends in one member at a time
into the name tag elimination game.]

1011
00:51:46,511 --> 00:51:51,169
<i>You have to keep your transmitter on
and can only move as you're directed to move.</i>

1012
00:51:51,170 --> 00:51:52,900
<i>And thus, you must eliminate
your opponent's name tag.</i>

1013
00:51:52,901 --> 00:51:56,512
<i>Once a member is ousted,
the next person from the team must enter.</i>

1014
00:51:56,513 --> 00:52:00,079
<i>And the team with the final survivor
wins the game.</i>

1015
00:52:01,155 --> 00:52:05,685
<i>Please think carefully and choose
who will be the first avatar.</i>

1016
00:52:05,686 --> 00:52:09,117
I think Kyung Gyu should be the director.
How should we designate the order?

1017
00:52:09,117 --> 00:52:12,154
Which style do you prefer?
Hiddink or Murino?

1018
00:52:12,155 --> 00:52:14,262
Which director style should I do?

1019
00:52:14,263 --> 00:52:16,618
[Is his style more along the lines
of Hiddink, or Murino?]

1020
00:52:16,619 --> 00:52:18,896
- His soccer style?
- Yes.

1021
00:52:19,429 --> 00:52:21,438
I don't... really know.

1022
00:52:22,835 --> 00:52:26,313
- What are you doing?
- I'll just wing it and yell it out.

1023
00:52:26,314 --> 00:52:28,039
Where you placed this is a little...

1024
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:34,207
[Who will be the first avatar to go in
from the Orange Team?]

1025
00:52:34,208 --> 00:52:35,881
Don't you think sending Suk Jin in first
would be the best?

1026
00:52:35,882 --> 00:52:39,195
- Why is it always me?
- Since we don't know how this will go...

1027
00:52:39,196 --> 00:52:44,551
[Sending him in as experiment since
it's hard to predict what could happen?]

1028
00:52:45,055 --> 00:52:46,532
Let's go with Suk Jin.

1029
00:52:47,939 --> 00:52:50,207
[Orange Team's first avatar, Suk Jin.]

1030
00:52:50,791 --> 00:52:53,229
Look at the second stairwell.

1031
00:52:53,230 --> 00:52:55,595
- Do you see the stairwell?
- Yes.

1032
00:52:55,596 --> 00:52:59,642
When I tell you to jump,
I want you to jump off.

1033
00:53:00,679 --> 00:53:02,448
You want him to jump down
from the top?

1034
00:53:02,449 --> 00:53:04,999
[Rule: Must follow the director's orders.]

1035
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,831
The reason being, we need the visual.

1036
00:53:06,832 --> 00:53:09,816
Even though eliminating the name tag
is also important...

1037
00:53:09,817 --> 00:53:13,019
[Director's theory:
Game is important too, but image comes first]

1038
00:53:13,020 --> 00:53:15,109
Let's all stand up.

1039
00:53:15,110 --> 00:53:16,847
[Blue Team's director is Ha Ha.]

1040
00:53:18,172 --> 00:53:19,577
We're going to get our revenge today

1041
00:53:19,578 --> 00:53:22,162
but you have to know
how to rip off the name tag.

1042
00:53:22,163 --> 00:53:26,419
[Sharing the wisdom of how to rip off
the name tags with the first timers.]

1043
00:53:26,420 --> 00:53:29,222
You have to snap it off.
All the little kids out there, watch closely.

1044
00:53:29,672 --> 00:53:33,739
[Showing the right way to rip off
the name tag in a safe manner.]

1045
00:53:33,740 --> 00:53:36,270
- Where is everyone?
- Sneak up on your target first.

1046
00:53:36,271 --> 00:53:39,346
If you rip it off like this,
he can turn around and escape.

1047
00:53:39,347 --> 00:53:41,116
That's why... there you go!

1048
00:53:41,117 --> 00:53:45,669
[Taking the time to attack
is a sure means of defeat.]

1049
00:53:45,670 --> 00:53:48,423
- This way...
- You have to concentrate and attack!

1050
00:53:48,424 --> 00:53:50,570
At all times... when you rip it off...

1051
00:53:50,571 --> 00:53:54,266
When you go in to rip it off,
with your left hand, grab the target.

1052
00:53:54,267 --> 00:53:56,675
Grab your target with the left hand,
and rip it off with your right!

1053
00:53:59,136 --> 00:54:01,967
[This is the years' worth of know-how.]

1054
00:54:01,968 --> 00:54:03,461
- Gary, out!
- Okay, I think I got it.

1055
00:54:05,838 --> 00:54:08,219
[In Gwon's turn to try.]

1056
00:54:08,220 --> 00:54:11,588
- You're saying this is no good?
- Because I can do this!

1057
00:54:11,589 --> 00:54:12,662
[Watch out for the counterattack!]

1058
00:54:16,906 --> 00:54:20,388
[That's why you must grab
the target with the left hand!]

1059
00:54:20,389 --> 00:54:22,826
- That's right!
- You have to snap it off.

1060
00:54:25,711 --> 00:54:26,798

[Blue Team's first avatar, In Gwon.]

1064
00:54:36,703 --> 00:54:38,420
Wow, this is...

1065
00:54:40,366 --> 00:54:42,669
[An immediate face-off!]

1066
00:54:43,732 --> 00:54:46,162
- Is it In Gwon?
- They sent In Gwon first.

1067
00:54:46,163 --> 00:54:48,673
- Did he see him?
- If you see him, rip it off!

1068
00:54:48,674 --> 00:54:51,385
- There they are!
- He sees him!

1069
00:54:51,386 --> 00:54:53,880
- There they are.
- They're already facing each other.

1070
00:54:53,881 --> 00:54:56,406
[Even if they're facing off, they can't
move without the director's say.]

1071
00:54:57,768 --> 00:55:00,107
In Gwon... run up to the third floor.

1072
00:55:00,108 --> 00:55:01,968
Run off to the third floor.

1073
00:55:06,060 --> 00:55:09,031
- In Gwon's running away.
- He's running away.

1074
00:55:09,032 --> 00:55:11,889
You have to hide.
Hide yourself so he can't find you.

1075
00:55:11,890 --> 00:55:14,091
[Running away just as
Ha Ha is directing him to.]

- No, I want you to wait.</i>

1078

<i>You have to hide behind the door.
If you stay like that, he'll see you.</i>

1079

<i>- Behind the door.
- Hide behind the door.</i>

1080
00:55:25,629 --> 00:55:27,039
I think he went up to the third floor.

1081
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:28,420
- Third floor!
- He's over there!

1082
00:55:28,421 --> 00:55:31,192
He's in the lecture hall on the third floor.

1083
00:55:31,193 --> 00:55:33,053
He's in the lecture hall on the third floor.

1084
00:55:33,054 --> 00:55:34,183
Third floor.

1085
00:55:35,439 --> 00:55:37,243
Let's have a face-off.

1086

- Already?
- You don't think?

[Immediately taking his teammates'
hesitation into consideration?]

1090
00:55:49,027 --> 00:55:51,157
Sit down on that sofa for a minute.

1091
00:55:53,311 --> 00:55:54,973
Okay, I'll sit down.

1092
00:55:56,893 --> 00:56:00,238
- Now! The time is now!
- Come down to the second floor!

1093

- Go back to where you were! Hurry!
- Get back down there and rip it off!

1094
00:56:04,540 --> 00:56:05,967

- Go back to where you were.

- He's heading down to the second floor.

He's heading back down.
Watch your back.

1098

Go inside that empty room.

1099

- Into the empty room?
- Move fast! He's running away.

Why didn't he pretend to be in pain?

1120
00:57:25,092 --> 00:57:26,527
He should've pretended to be in pain.

1121
00:57:26,528 --> 00:57:29,891
He should've pretended to be in pain,
and use that moment to escape.

1122

You have to listen to the
direction carefully.

If the director tells you to pretend to
be in pain, you have to do it.

the wall as he's instructed!]

1145
00:58:40,308 --> 00:58:41,648
Tell him to hold it.

1146
00:58:41,649 --> 00:58:43,863
If you think you're going to lose,
pretend that you're hurt.

1147
00:58:43,864 --> 00:58:45,805
Push his back up against the wall!

1148
00:58:45,806 --> 00:58:47,292
Go up to the second floor!
Run away!

1149
00:58:47,293 --> 00:58:48,837
<i>Go up to the second floor!
Run away!</i>

1150
00:58:48,838 --> 00:58:50,164
What?

1151
00:58:50,574 --> 00:58:54,286
[Telling him to run away in
the middle of an attack?]

1152
00:58:54,287 --> 00:58:55,351
Run away!

1153
00:58:55,352 --> 00:58:56,512
<i>Run away!</i>

1154
00:58:56,512 --> 00:58:59,345
[Must follow the director's orders
unconditionally.]

1155
00:59:01,661 --> 00:59:03,720
- Just run away!
- Get him!

1156
00:59:03,721 --> 00:59:05,686
- Get him!
- Go after him!

1157
00:59:05,687 --> 00:59:08,627
- Go after him!
- In Gwon's doing a good job.

1158
00:59:08,628 --> 00:59:10,323
That's good!
Go get him!

1159
00:59:10,324 --> 00:59:12,045
Why am I running away?

1160
00:59:14,989 --> 00:59:18,360
[Blue Team's avatar In Gwon vs.
Orange Team's Kwang-vatar.]

1161
00:59:28,820 --> 00:59:35,731
[Avatar In Gwon eliminates two in a row!]

1162
00:59:35,731 --> 00:59:37,992
<i>Avatar Lee Kwang Soo, out.</i>

1163
00:59:37,993 --> 00:59:39,292
<i>Avatar Lee Kwang Soo, out.</i>

1164
00:59:39,293 --> 00:59:41,213
<i>Send in the next player.</i>

1165
00:59:41,214 --> 00:59:42,997
What do we do?

1166
00:59:45,375 --> 00:59:47,397
Why did you make me run
away back there?

1167
00:59:47,398 --> 00:59:49,890
Why did you make me run away back there
while I was attacking In Gwon?

1168
00:59:49,891 --> 00:59:51,709
The director doesn't have
the time to talk.

1169
00:59:51,710 --> 00:59:54,083
Get out.
He's in no mood to talk right now.

1170
00:59:54,084 --> 00:59:55,757
- I had his name tag in my hand!
- Sorry.

1171
00:59:55,758 --> 00:59:59,573
But you looked like you were
in trouble on my screen.

1172
01:00:00,554 --> 01:00:05,403
[Kwang-vatar had In Gwon's
name tag in his hand...]

1173
01:00:05,404 --> 01:00:06,773
<i>Run up to the second floor
and run away!</i>

1174
01:00:07,008 --> 01:00:11,669
[When he almost won... run away?]

1175
01:00:13,424 --> 01:00:16,675
All I had to do was pull off the name tag,
but you suddenly ordered me to run.

1176
01:00:16,676 --> 01:00:20,543
[His nickname is Kwang-vatar, but he
didn't even get the chance to play...]

1177
01:00:20,993 --> 01:00:23,939
[Avatar In Gwon already having
ousted two players.]

1178
01:00:24,967 --> 01:00:28,081
- It's a girl.
- It's Ji Hyo! Don't give her any breaks!

1179
01:00:28,082 --> 01:00:30,620
- It's okay!
- Ji Hyo's really good.

1180
01:00:30,621 --> 01:00:32,636
Call out In Gwon's name.

1181
01:00:32,637 --> 01:00:35,429
Call out In Gwon's name,
and go look for him.

1182
01:00:36,130 --> 01:00:37,870
In Gwon!

1183
01:00:38,769 --> 01:00:42,055
- In Gwon!
- Ji Hyo's a great actress too.

1184
01:00:42,997 --> 01:00:45,357
- There's In Gwon.
- I see him.

1185
01:00:45,358 --> 01:00:47,835
Second floor.
He's up on the second floor.

1186
01:00:48,719 --> 01:00:50,685
He's up on the second floor.
Go up to the second floor.

1187
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:53,440
Go up to the second floor.
Call out to him.

1188
01:00:53,441 --> 01:00:55,199
Kim In Gwon!

1189
01:00:55,432 --> 01:00:58,262
I think she's going to come up the stairs.
You have to be careful.

1190
01:00:58,263 --> 01:00:59,634
In Gwon!

1191
01:00:59,635 --> 01:01:02,036
[Heading up the stairs
where In Gwon is hiding.]

1192
01:01:02,037 --> 01:01:03,765
Stay hidden in the stairwell.

1193
01:01:03,766 --> 01:01:07,670
[She's approaching!
Hide up the stairs, then ambush her!]

1194
01:01:07,671 --> 01:01:09,856
- Wait, In Gwon.
- She's coming up behind you!

1195
01:01:09,857 --> 01:01:11,541
She's right behind you!
Right behind you!

1196
01:01:12,594 --> 01:01:14,467
- Run back down!
- Run down the steps!

1197
01:01:14,468 --> 01:01:16,175
Run back down the stairs!

1198
01:01:17,039 --> 01:01:19,449
- I think we need to do something.
- Director Ha Ha...

1199
01:01:19,942 --> 01:01:23,105
Director Ha Ha?
Ha Ha is the director?

1200
01:01:23,801 --> 01:01:25,166
Oh my God!

1201
01:01:25,167 --> 01:01:26,446
Don't even respond to her.

1202
01:01:26,447 --> 01:01:29,728
Roll out your tongue at her.
Start right now.

1203
01:01:29,763 --> 01:01:32,016
Roll out your tongue at her.

1204
01:01:32,785 --> 01:01:36,142
[Obeying his orders so well.]

1205
01:01:36,143 --> 01:01:37,761
What are you doing?

1206
01:01:39,404 --> 01:01:41,024
Should I tell her to smack him?

1207
01:01:43,178 --> 01:01:46,420
Slap In Gwon.
Slap In Gwon in the face.

1208
01:01:46,421 --> 01:01:48,909
[Slap In Gwon on the face!]

1209
01:01:53,175 --> 01:01:55,087
[I was ordered to do it.
Sorry...]

1210
01:01:55,088 --> 01:01:58,268
Since you've been slapped on the left,
stick out your right cheek.

1211
01:01:58,269 --> 01:02:00,179
Stick out your right cheek.

1212
01:02:00,180 --> 01:02:03,114
- Tell her to slap your other cheek.
- Slap my other cheek.

1213
01:02:03,115 --> 01:02:04,718
- The moment she slaps you, rip it off.
- Slap him again.

1214
01:02:10,306 --> 01:02:13,237
[The headquarters is to
blame for this nonsense.]

1215
01:02:13,238 --> 01:02:15,651
Say it very firmly,
'Hey, Song Ji Hyo!'

1216
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:17,848
Hey, Song Ji Hyo!

1217
01:02:18,501 --> 01:02:20,445
Let's do this!

1218
01:02:21,197 --> 01:02:22,745
Should we bring her down?

1219
01:02:22,746 --> 01:02:25,857
Start retreating backwards.

1220
01:02:25,858 --> 01:02:28,061
[Director Kyung Gyu telling her to
backtrack back down to the first floor.]

1221
01:02:29,588 --> 01:02:30,716
She's leaving.

1222
01:02:30,717 --> 01:02:31,784
She's leaving.

1223
01:02:34,354 --> 01:02:37,522
- Run after her and eliminate her!
- Do it now!

1224
01:02:37,523 --> 01:02:39,055
Run after her and eliminate her!

1225
01:02:39,056 --> 01:02:41,039
Now's your chance!
Run!

1226
01:02:41,040 --> 01:02:43,598
He's coming!
Hide!

1227
01:02:43,599 --> 01:02:45,077
Stick to the wall right now!

1228
01:02:46,114 --> 01:02:47,262
Eliminate him!

1229
01:02:47,262 --> 01:02:49,115
Where did they go?

1230
01:02:51,833 --> 01:02:56,415
[A blind spot... all they can
hear is a shuffling noise.]

1231
01:03:00,065 --> 01:03:02,477
[Blank-vatar's ambush attack!]

1232
01:03:05,908 --> 01:03:08,376
[Her hand is on his name tag!]

1233
01:03:12,090 --> 01:03:16,544
[Blank-vatar eliminates Avatar In Gwon!]

1234
01:03:16,545 --> 01:03:18,956
- What happened?
- Avatar Kim In Gwon, out.

1235
01:03:18,957 --> 01:03:21,750
<i>Avatar Kim In Gwon, out.</i>

1236
01:03:21,751 --> 01:03:24,341
She did it!
That's our Song Ji Hyo!

1237
01:03:24,342 --> 01:03:27,213
[Ji Hyo's our ace.
An ace is an ace!]

1238
01:03:27,974 --> 01:03:29,919
<i>Avatar Kim In Gwon, out.</i>

1239
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:33,588
- Send in the next player.
- What do I do? I'm so scared!

1240
01:03:33,589 --> 01:03:35,559
[Blue Team's Hyun Kyung Avatar going in.]

1241
01:03:35,560 --> 01:03:37,798
I saw the way you played dodge ball earlier.
It's okay, you can do it.

1242
01:03:37,799 --> 01:03:41,308
[A imminent face-off between
the female avatars.]

1243
01:03:41,309 --> 01:03:43,601
How in the world does Ji Hyo do it?

1244
01:03:44,285 --> 01:03:47,647
Where's their headquarters?
Should we attack their headquarters?

1245
01:03:48,381 --> 01:03:52,079
Let's go attack their headquarters.

1246
01:03:52,978 --> 01:03:54,167
Yes.

1247
01:03:54,168 --> 01:03:58,511
Go find their headquarters and eliminate
whomever comes out immediately.

1248
01:03:58,512 --> 01:04:00,232
I think it's on the
second floor somewhere.

1249
01:04:01,436 --> 01:04:02,976
I wonder who it'll be?

1250
01:04:03,523 --> 01:04:06,625
- I think someone's coming.
- She's lying in wait for you.

1251
01:04:06,626 --> 01:04:08,497
- She's right up against the wall.
- There she is to the right.

1252
01:04:08,498 --> 01:04:12,049
[The two avatars closing in on each other.]

1253
01:04:12,602 --> 01:04:16,124
- I know that you're behind that wall.
- Watch out! She's right there!

1254
01:04:16,125 --> 01:04:17,874
Back up against the wall!

1255
01:04:17,875 --> 01:04:19,469
She's right there.
They see each other.

1256
01:04:19,470 --> 01:04:20,770
- Hello.
- Hello.

1257
01:04:21,264 --> 01:04:22,644
Ryu Hyun Kyung...

1258
01:04:22,645 --> 01:04:24,142
Scream.
Scream right now.

1259
01:04:24,143 --> 01:04:25,494
Nice.

1260
01:04:30,140 --> 01:04:31,855
Start dancing.
Break out into a sudden dance.

1261
01:04:32,675 --> 01:04:35,526
[Ordering her to start
dancing out of the blue.]

1262
01:04:35,527 --> 01:04:39,015
[She's actually doing it?]

1263
01:04:42,779 --> 01:04:46,522
[Trying to figure out the reasons
behind her sudden dance moves.]

1264
01:04:46,523 --> 01:04:48,723
She's trying to entice you to attack her.

1265
01:04:48,724 --> 01:04:50,533
That conniving wench.

1266
01:04:51,794 --> 01:04:54,936
- Approach her... 'Who do you think you are?'
- Who do you think you are!

1267
01:04:55,538 --> 01:04:58,604
- I'm a dancing machine!
- I'm a dancing machine!

1268
01:05:01,551 --> 01:05:04,015
[Happy]

1269
01:05:05,040 --> 01:05:07,314
Turn around from her quickly.

1270
01:05:07,315 --> 01:05:08,928
Do a sudden turnaround.

1271
01:05:10,242 --> 01:05:11,834
- Like this?
- Turn around her.

1272
01:05:12,389 --> 01:05:13,881
Go behind Hyun Kyung right now.

1273
01:05:14,646 --> 01:05:17,392
[Director Kyung Gyu starting
to show his frustration.]

1274
01:05:17,927 --> 01:05:19,743
Rip it off!
Just rip it off right now!

1275
01:05:21,189 --> 01:05:22,664
- Just rip it off!
- Stand still!

1276
01:05:22,979 --> 01:05:25,376
[Hyun Kyung avatar shoves her back!]

1277
01:05:28,756 --> 01:05:30,958
[Completely satisfied with
Hyun Kyung avatar's brute strength.]

1278
01:05:31,734 --> 01:05:34,424
Eliminate her!
You can't get shoved around!

1279
01:05:35,525 --> 01:05:37,955
Ji Hyo... that hurts.
Please, that hurts.

1280
01:05:40,835 --> 01:05:43,577
[And like ace, Ji Hyo turns her body around
and avoids the attack.]

1281
01:05:44,582 --> 01:05:46,838
That was good.
Relax and show her another dance.

1282
01:05:46,839 --> 01:05:49,732
[As long as the director says...]

1283
01:05:52,855 --> 01:05:54,261
There you go.

1284
01:05:54,262 --> 01:05:57,187
- There you go.
- Enough. She's getting tired out.

1285
01:05:57,756 --> 01:06:00,372
Ji Hyo, listen carefully.
Listen to me carefully.

1286
01:06:01,410 --> 01:06:02,937
Listen carefully.
Listen to me carefully.

1287
01:06:05,574 --> 01:06:07,409
[What is she planning?]

1288
01:06:10,111 --> 01:06:11,907
Like this...

1289
01:06:12,563 --> 01:06:13,669
[What?]

1290
01:06:13,670 --> 01:06:15,962
[What is she doing to her
own name tag?]

1291
01:06:19,657 --> 01:06:23,208
[Blank-vatar self terminates herself?]

1292
01:06:24,074 --> 01:06:25,276
What the heck?

1293
01:06:26,794 --> 01:06:30,163
[What kind of a plan is this?]

1294
01:06:30,952 --> 01:06:32,748
Listen carefully.
Listen to me carefully.

1295
01:06:32,749 --> 01:06:36,744
Rip off the name tag on your back,
and give it to her.

1296
01:06:36,745 --> 01:06:37,833
What?

1297
01:06:37,834 --> 01:06:42,479
Give it to her, and once you do,
Jae Suk is going to go out immediately.

1298
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:45,398
[Jae Suk avatar to go out immediately,
and spring an ambush attack.]

1299
01:06:45,874 --> 01:06:47,129
Like this.

1300
01:06:47,130 --> 01:06:48,434
Go.

1301
01:06:49,415 --> 01:06:50,876
[Jae Suk avatar makes his way in!]

1302
01:06:50,877 --> 01:06:52,364
Like this...

1303
01:06:52,365 --> 01:06:54,237
He just told her to self-terminate.

1304
01:06:54,238 --> 01:06:57,067
I think he ordered her to do it because
Jae Suk is going right in.

1305
01:06:57,780 --> 01:06:59,816
[Rushing to make her escape
out of fear.]

1306
01:07:01,404 --> 01:07:03,161
I don't think you should go that way.

1307
01:07:03,162 --> 01:07:04,754
I don't think you should go that way.

1308
01:07:05,996 --> 01:07:08,616
[Hi!]

1309

[Blank and Kwang brother and sister
with no rhythm in their bodies.]

they're trying for...]

ringing throughout the room.]

much better.</i>

- That was amazing!

1417
01:15:32,785 --> 01:15:35,482
- I thought I was at a concert.
- That was unbelievable.

1418
01:15:35,483 --> 01:15:41,010

was because all these people came to help us.

1419
01:15:41,011 --> 01:15:42,666
- Thank you!
- Aren't you going to help us?

1420
01:15:42,667 --> 01:15:45,726
I bet the power for each song
is different.

1421
01:15:45,727 --> 01:15:48,765
[The psychic power for each song is different
depending on the coin used.]

1422

for coming on the show to help!]

1423
01:15:53,706 --> 01:15:55,632
- That was so cool!
- I can't believe we scored 96 points.

1424
01:15:55,633 --> 01:15:58,655
- Isn't 96 points too high for that song?
- I feel so moved by what just happened.

1425
01:16:00,666 --> 01:16:04,629
[Just because it was cool doesn't mean
that everyone should try it.]

1426
01:16:06,645 --> 01:16:09,442
[Next song to be sung by the Blue Team-
Hyun Kyung and In Gwon to sing 'Tears'.]

1431
01:16:19,856 --> 01:16:20,928
[The psychic power this time around
is the wire?]

1432
01:16:22,528 --> 01:16:24,763
I'll get on it.
I'm good at riding things like that.

1433
01:16:24,764 --> 01:16:26,748
I really like being on the wire.

1434

[R1- 'Tears'.
How will the wire psychic power work?]

1435
01:16:38,597 --> 01:16:40,181

[Having to sing, having to get on the wire...
so much to have to do...]

1437

[How is the wire going to be put to use?]

1442
01:17:13,511 --> 01:17:16,038
[Automatic screaming reaction.]

1443
01:17:22,184 --> 01:17:23,605
[We'll even bring up the monitor for you.]

1444
01:17:27,630 --> 01:17:30,642
[Automatically breaking down into a scream
that brings up her voice five octaves higher.]

1445
01:17:45,432 --> 01:17:48,353
- You have to sing the harmony too!
- Is that supposed to help her?

1446
01:17:52,899 --> 01:17:55,085
[A nice and clean finish.]

1447
01:17:55,086 --> 01:17:56,026
You're good!

1448
01:18:01,004 --> 01:18:04,399
[With the automatic screams added in,
they score 98 points!]

1449
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:06,932
[A very effective psychic power.]

1450
01:18:07,870 --> 01:18:09,830
It makes the screams come out automatically.

1451
01:18:10,979 --> 01:18:13,958
- But we have 'Shabang Shabang'.
- We do have 'Shabang Shabang'.

1452
01:18:13,959 --> 01:18:15,511
[Orange Team's next song is,
'Shabang Shabang' by Park Hyun Bin.]

1453

[Orange Team uses a gold coin song.]

1454
01:18:23,915 --> 01:18:25,426
He's not bad.

1455
01:18:25,427 --> 01:18:27,621

[Kyung Gyu and Big-nose singing a duet.]

1457
01:18:32,620 --> 01:18:34,787
I feel like I'm watching a real dinner outing.

1458
01:18:34,788 --> 01:18:36,898
They really are two middle aged men.

1459
01:18:38,097 --> 01:18:40,118
[The three employees
accompanying the bosses.]

1460
01:18:48,995 --> 01:18:52,934

1461
01:19:01,045 --> 01:19:06,278
[The original singer...
Park Hyun Bin makes an appearance!]

1462
01:19:06,279 --> 01:19:11,110
[This is what you call psychic power!]

1463
01:19:13,535 --> 01:19:15,349
[We're all set!]

1464
01:19:16,690 --> 01:19:20,370
[The ability to call in the original
king of trots!]

But it's really exciting.

1472
01:20:10,780 --> 01:20:12,781
Don't you just want to break
out into a dance?

1473
01:20:14,273 --> 01:20:17,805
[If you're excited,
then join us in the dance!]

1474
01:20:29,576 --> 01:20:33,342
[Hyun Bin toying with his audience.]

1475
01:20:54,099 --> 01:20:57,646
[The king of trot brings the stage to life!]

1476
01:21:02,221 --> 01:21:04,501
[The power of the original singer's power-
99 points!]

1477
01:21:04,502 --> 01:21:06,210
If you're done singing, then leave!

1478
01:21:06,822 --> 01:21:09,641
- Why are you back here again?
- What's wrong with you guys? That's rude!

1479
01:21:09,641 --> 01:21:12,795
Have I been called in because of
some psychic power of yours?

1480
01:21:13,502 --> 01:21:15,279
I know that he's a very busy man...

1481
01:21:15,280 --> 01:21:18,221
[King of trot, Hyun Bin taking the time out
of his busy schedule to come on the show.]

1482
01:21:18,222 --> 01:21:22,033
[Seeing Hyun Bin make his appearance was
like seeing victory at the end of a battle.]

1483
01:21:22,034 --> 01:21:24,202
The choir coming out earlier,
and now Hyun Bin?

1484
01:21:24,203 --> 01:21:26,456
- This is really amazing.
- Why didn't you come out at first stance?

1485
01:21:26,457 --> 01:21:28,909
- If he had, it would've been a perfect score.
- Yes, it would've been 100 points.

1486
01:21:28,910 --> 01:21:32,219
I wanted to hear Lee Kyung Gyu sing
parts of the song before I came out.

1487
01:21:32,220 --> 01:21:34,875
A round of applause for
our friend, Hyun Bin.

1488
01:21:34,876 --> 01:21:38,775
[Orange Team's savior, Park Hyun Bin!]

1489
01:21:42,115 --> 01:21:44,237
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much.

1490
01:21:44,830 --> 01:21:48,233
[Thank you to Park Hyun Bin for taking
the time out of his busy schedule!]

1491
01:21:48,234 --> 01:21:49,928
Having Hyun Bin come out was
really amazing.

1492
01:21:49,929 --> 01:21:53,416
The really good news is that our
next song is 'Gangnam Style'.

1493
01:21:53,417 --> 01:21:55,684
- You think Psy will come?
- If he does, it's over!

1494
01:22:00,561 --> 01:22:04,384
[He was too busy to make it...]

1495
01:22:04,385 --> 01:22:08,231
[Gangnam Style's psychic power is
electric karaoke room!]

1496
01:22:08,232 --> 01:22:14,990
[Must pedal fast to generate the power to
turn on the karaoke monitor screen.]

1497
01:22:17,336 --> 01:22:22,653
[Must pedal to their death in
order to be able to sing.]

1498
01:22:29,283 --> 01:22:32,187
[Kwang Soo's rage filled pedaling!]

1499
01:22:40,565 --> 01:22:42,352
[Can barely even dance from
the exhaustion.]

1500
01:22:49,158 --> 01:22:53,304
[Switching out the peddler to
Big-nose and Blank Ji.]

1501
01:22:53,305 --> 01:22:55,061
Pedal, Suk Jin!

1502
01:23:01,769 --> 01:23:05,431
[The song's highlight that the whole world
is familiar with by now.]

1503
01:23:08,417 --> 01:23:10,607
You have to do the dance!

1504
01:23:10,608 --> 01:23:12,016
This is the highlight!

1505
01:23:12,017 --> 01:23:13,988
- How can you leave this out?
- What's the point if you leave it out?

1506
01:23:15,023 --> 01:23:17,314
You have to do this part!
- Pedal!

1507
01:23:18,929 --> 01:23:20,780
The chains out of place.

1508
01:23:25,637 --> 01:23:27,523
You guys are ruining it!

1509
01:23:31,919 --> 01:23:33,208
The chain is out of place.

1510
01:23:34,432 --> 01:23:37,045
[Back to pedaling!]

1511
01:23:48,036 --> 01:23:50,675
[The yellow guy into it!]

1512
01:23:51,820 --> 01:23:54,329
[But the music cuts off again.]

1513
01:24:06,006 --> 01:24:08,156
This is the lamest version of this song
I've ever heard.

1514
01:24:08,157 --> 01:24:10,555
[What's the score for this song
with the electric psychic power?]

1515
01:24:12,912 --> 01:24:16,582
- I really wanted to see Jae Suk's dance.
- More than anything else...

1516
01:24:16,583 --> 01:24:19,922
If this is the best I can do, then I
can't even leave the house for two days.

1517
01:24:19,923 --> 01:24:21,859
This is so frustrating.

1518
01:24:22,360 --> 01:24:25,360
All we had to do was keep going at the verse
when it says, 'Oppa is Gangnam style.'

1519
01:24:25,361 --> 01:24:26,914
What was I to do?
I got too exhausted.

1520
01:24:29,602 --> 01:24:33,239
[And the Blue Team follows
with 84 points.]

1521
01:24:33,240 --> 01:24:37,053
[Blue Team's last gold coin song-
A chance to pick their song!]

1522
01:24:37,054 --> 01:24:38,845
Their psychic power isn't about
picking out the song randomly?

1523
01:24:39,505 --> 01:24:41,133
That's what it truly means to pick freely.

1524
01:24:41,868 --> 01:24:43,455
What are you going to sing?

1525
01:24:45,880 --> 01:24:47,909
We're going to sing , 'Romantic cat'.

1526
01:24:47,910 --> 01:24:50,346
- Romantic cat?
- You're singing the musical?

1527
01:24:54,731 --> 01:24:57,047
Sweet little kitty?
What's that?

1528
01:24:57,163 --> 01:25:02,156
[Sung by: Hyung Kyung and
a legion of boys.]

1529
01:25:04,702 --> 01:25:07,812
[Festival lady revving up to
the main event.]

1530
01:25:14,949 --> 01:25:16,672
Byul!

1531
01:25:20,429 --> 01:25:22,487
- Byul!
- Sister-in-law!

1532
01:25:28,077 --> 01:25:32,237
[Hyun Kyung has a nice and clear voice!]

1533
01:25:40,219 --> 01:25:42,257
[About to explode!]

1534
01:25:46,617 --> 01:25:51,321
[A chaotic performance.]

1535
01:25:58,487 --> 01:26:01,009
[In Gwon's knocked out after
running into Kkuk.]

1536
01:26:02,135 --> 01:26:06,198
[Banging into this and that...
Blue Team is just full of energy!]

1537
01:26:09,575 --> 01:26:12,234
[In Gwon breaks out in a scream
from the excitement.]

1538
01:26:21,888 --> 01:26:24,300
[Scream!]

1539
01:26:28,538 --> 01:26:31,535
[Let's do it one more time!]

1540
01:26:31,536 --> 01:26:35,139
[Explosion of energy!]

1541
01:26:45,246 --> 01:26:48,231
[Blue Team's one last burst of energy!]

1542
01:26:55,912 --> 01:26:57,824
- Rock and roll!
- Yeah!

1543
01:26:57,825 --> 01:27:01,218
[Everyone applauding a great performance.]

1544
01:27:01,219 --> 01:27:03,371
- We'll sing one more song.
- Let us sing once more.

1545
01:27:04,276 --> 01:27:10,210
[Current score: Orange Team with 99 points.
What will Blue Team's score be?]

1546
01:27:11,104 --> 01:27:13,358
[What is this response?]

1547
01:27:18,155 --> 01:27:21,149
[Blue Team scores 97 points!]

1548
01:27:21,150 --> 01:27:25,567
[By two point difference,
the Orange Team wins!]

1549
01:27:25,568 --> 01:27:27,075
- We won!
- We did it!

1550
01:27:27,076 --> 01:27:28,778
Great job!

1551
01:27:28,779 --> 01:27:30,259
And unfortunately enough...

1552
01:27:30,260 --> 01:27:32,654
just when In Gwon found his rhythm,
it's all over.

1553
01:27:33,902 --> 01:27:37,015
- I really had a great time today.
- When In Gwon finally found his rhythm.

1554
01:27:37,016 --> 01:27:39,851
You really are the festival lady.

1555
01:27:39,852 --> 01:27:41,532
You were the best.

1556
01:27:43,108 --> 01:27:46,040
[Whatever the case, the ultimate winner of
the psychic karaoke room is, Orange team!]

1557
01:27:46,041 --> 01:27:48,303
[What's the winning prize?]

1558
01:27:51,610 --> 01:27:52,868
This is real gold here.

1559
01:27:52,869 --> 01:27:57,322
[Running Man singing race! A gold trophy!]

1560
01:27:57,323 --> 01:27:58,841
That's awesome.

1561
01:27:58,842 --> 01:28:00,762
- This whole thing is gold?
- No, just this part.

1562
01:28:00,763 --> 01:28:04,885
Why are you always trying to scrape up
all the gold on this show?

1563
01:28:04,886 --> 01:28:06,689
You think Running Man is
your gold shop?

1564
01:28:06,690 --> 01:28:08,433
Thank you!

1565
01:28:08,434 --> 01:28:10,344
Our singing race today...

1566
01:28:10,345 --> 01:28:14,737
Lee Kyung Gyu, Ryu Hyun Kyung,
and Kim In Gwon for coming out...

1567
01:28:14,738 --> 01:28:16,518
We had a great time today
thanks to all three of you.

1568
01:28:16,519 --> 01:28:18,066
We'd all like to thank you once again.
Thank you!

1569
01:28:18,067 --> 01:28:20,054
[Thank you to our guests for coming on the
show and bringing laughter to everyone!]

1570
01:28:20,940 --> 01:28:22,620
Here.

1571
01:28:22,621 --> 01:28:26,716
[Is Kyung Gyu gifting his winning trophy
to Hyun Kyung?]

1572
01:28:26,717 --> 01:28:29,837
[But after a closer look,
we realize he took the gold portion off.]

1573
01:28:30,048 --> 01:28:33,207
