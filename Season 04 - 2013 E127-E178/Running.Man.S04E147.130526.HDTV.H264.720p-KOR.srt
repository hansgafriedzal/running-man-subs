8
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:36,580
Hello, Jong Kook!

9
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:41,500
When... I first saw you,
I thought you were athlete, Son Ki Jung.

10
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:44,450
- I'm a flower boy today.
- Why do you have that on your head?

11
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:46,340
I'm wearing a flower crown
because I'm a flower boy.

12
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:48,640
What are you doing?
Huh?

13
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,810
[Posing every chance he gets.]

14
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:51,180

[Skinny Yoo Hyuk of Apgujeong.]

18
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:07,790
What's that bed of flowers
you've got on your head?

19
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:10,440
- Flower bed?
- Wait a second...

20
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:13,040
- Isn't that a bed of weeds?
- We're all flower boys.

21
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,780
- What did you say?
- We're flower boys.

22
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:17,470
I was wondering who took my jacket.

23
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:19,420
But I see you're the one who took it.

24
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:22,990
That is so tacky!
That's so totally tacky!

25
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:26,210
- The least I could was dress up like this.
- You are a sight for sore eyes!

26
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:29,780
- What in the world are you wearing?
- Isn't this kind of fashion a given?

27
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:32,040
Don't you have a stylist?

28
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:34,330
[This time it's handsome Mr. Gary
from Jamsil.]

29

00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:10,280
- You make a good looking man.
- Let's all each have a drink.

00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:14,030
[Toasting with juice?]

40
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:16,160
I saw that you popped up in first place
in all the search engines.

Song Ji Hyo and Jung Jin Woon.

42
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:18,530

<i>[Move on to the grassy fields of
'Y' Training Center.]</i>

69
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:05,080
Grassy field always means...

70
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:07,270
A grassy field is a given since
this is an athletic competition.

71
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:09,710
I guess we'll be running our butts off.
Let's go.

72
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:13,120
[Off to the first location!]

73
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:18,210
- How are you now, Soo Hyun?
- I turned 26 this year.

74
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:21,160
I was 26 when I first started
on Running Man.

75
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:23,710
Were you with us from the beginning?

76
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:27,910
[Weak initial presence on the show.]

77
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:30,300
I'm sorry. I forgot you
were with us from the beginning.

78
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:31,850
Yes, I remember now.

79
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,070
- Soo Hyun, may I lower my speech with you?
- Yes.

80
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,870
No, that's not right.
You can't lower your speech with him yet.

81
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:39,350
How can you think of lowering your speech
with Soo Hyun when you've only just met him?

82
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:41,220
[Forbidden from acting friendly!]

83
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:43,130
- You've only just met him!
- But between us two...

84
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:45,010
Why do you keep bringing up how many
times he and I have met?

85
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,390
This is only your second time meeting Soo Hyun
since his first appearance on the show, right?

86
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:48,800
Do you like me or something?

87
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,030
- You sound like you're jealous.
- The reason being...

88
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:53,270
Let me tell you why, Kwang Soo.
Listen to me and don't misunderstand.

89
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:55,930
It's not good for the guest star.

90
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,400
How can you say that?

91
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,730
[It means, don't ruin that star's future.]

92
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:03,660
I have to get stuck between these
two lovebirds again?

93
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:08,750
We get along really great if we don't get
any male or female guests on the show.

94
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:12,470
I have a feeling someone will be
getting pissy a lot today.

95
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:16,720
- Who?
- I bet Gary will get pissy.

96
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:19,480
Gary is much better looking
than Kim Soo Hyun.

97
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,640
- Oh!
- Really?

98
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:23,360
- Kang Gary is very attractive.
- Really?

99
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:25,700
No one is better looking than
Kang Gary on Mondays.

100
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:26,790
Thanks, Ji Hyo.

101
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:30,120
My Tuesdays through Fridays become so
difficult with her saying things like that.

102
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:34,220
[His Mondays with Ji Hyo
is the highlight of his week.]

103
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:35,670
That's just so cute.

104
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:42,130
I feel like I'm going out with my girlfriend
and my girlfriend's father.

105
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:44,310
- I oppose. I oppose this relationship.
- Darn!

106
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:57,820
[Finally arriving at their first location.]

107
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:59,540
This is... wow, this really looks like...

108
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:02,730
- I think it's going to be hard.
- I bet it's going to be something hard.

109
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:05,410
It's a real athletic competition.

110
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:08,790
[Entering the
Flower Boy Athletic Competition arena.]

111
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:12,860
<i>It seems you haven't seen it yet,
but you should take a good look around.</i>

112
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:21,380
[The immense scale of the athletic track.]

113
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:26,160
[But...]

114
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,380
[Acupuncture mat]

115
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:31,420
- We're going to have to do this barefoot.
- Oh!

116
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:34,360
We have to do this whole thing
on top of the acupuncture mat?

117
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,510
- Ugh, seriously!
- That hurts your feet, doesn't it?

118
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:38,180
Try stepping on it, Soo Hyun.

119
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:40,330
- What is this?
- It's like a path of thorns.

120
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:43,470
Are you kidding me right now?
This whole this is an acupuncture mat?

121
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:46,010
- I didn't even wear socks today.
- Oh!

122
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:50,460
- I thought this was a sponge mat.
- That really hurts, Soo Hyun.

123
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:54,640
I feel like I'm going around with
my girlfriend and father-in-law right now.

124
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,480
- I oppose her relationship with you!
- Why?

125
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,160
- I oppose this relationship.
- I have my dreams!

126
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,700
That really does suit you guys.

127
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:02,100
- He does look like your father-in-law.
- This is exhausting me!

128
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:03,270
I oppose!

129
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:05,810
And our clothes are the same color
as this grassy field.

130
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:08,470
[Camouflage colors]

131
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:11,690
How am I going to do the hurdles when
my legs don't split very far?

132
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:15,380
The problem we have right now is,
this is all acupuncture mat, Suk Jin.

133
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:16,940
- What is?
- Oh!

134
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:20,180
- That's just absurd!
- Look at the acupuncture mat.

135
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:22,640
You can tell that it's an acupuncture mat
even at a quick glance.

136
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,820
I bet they're going to make us
do this barefoot.

137
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:26,850
Sorry!

138
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:28,100
Sorry!

139
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,060
I thought you were part of the grass.

140
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:37,230
Why did you give us this color?
When they're dressed in blue and red!

141
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:39,940
- Sorry! I thought you were grass.
- Hey!

142
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:41,790
I thought you were part of the grass.

143
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:43,840
Did you hear what he said?
He thought she was part of the grass.

144
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,930
I really thought you were
part of the grass.

145
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,990
<i>We welcome you to the first round of
the Flower Boy Athletic Competition.</i>

146
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:52,630
[Whatever the case,
welcome to the first round of competition.]

147
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:57,620
<i>As you can see for yourself,
the first round of the competition...</i>

148
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:00,500
<i>It's a 200m obstacle race
on the acupuncture mat.</i>

149
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:05,050
<i>The rule is, participating athletes
are not allowed to wear their socks.</i>

150
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:07,060
<i>You have to play the round
while barefoot.</i>

151
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:10,880
<i>You will be running a relay on
top of the acupuncture mat</i>

152
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:13,750
<i>and if you can make it in within the time
allotted, you'll pass the round.</i>

153
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:16,400
<i>First runner will start,
second runner will run to the corner</i>

154
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,350
<i>and the third runner will run
back to the start line.</i>

155
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:21,930
- I understand.
- All this on top of the acupuncture mat?

156
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:23,920
We can't do this on top of
the acupuncture mat!

157
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,540
<i>The allotted time is 45 seconds.</i>

158
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:29,280
- Let's not let them get away with this.
- How can we run 200m on this?

159
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,380
We can't run that track within 45 seconds
even if we ran normally in our shoes.

160
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,800
<i>It's 15 seconds per person.
That is extremely doable.</i>

161
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,210
That's absurd.
15 seconds per person?

162
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:39,940
You're talking about people who can't even
run 100m within 15 seconds.

163
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:42,800
<i>It is more than feasible since it's
only 70m per person.</i>

164
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:45,570
Since he put it that way,
I guess it sort of makes sense.

165
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:48,260
What do you mean, it makes sense?
This is totally absurd!

166
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:50,310
But it kind of makes sense
when you hear him put it like that.

167
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:52,700
We have to endure the pain and beat this
in order for them to stop.

168
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:55,040
Don't even give them the satisfaction
of letting them think that it hurts.

169
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,140
- Let's all just endure it.
- Just endure the pain.

170
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:59,300
- Let's just fight the pain.
- Does it really hurt that bad?

171
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:00,920
Hyun Woo.

172
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:03,580
If you just think that it doesn't hurt,
then it won't hurt.

173
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:05,760
It's not going to hurt at all
since we're invincible.

174
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,690
You just need to keep telling yourself
that it doesn't hurt.

175
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:11,380
[Is he attempting to brainwash himself?]

176
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:14,450
[Already in sync with Coach Kkuk.]

177
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:17,930
[200m acupuncture mat obstacle race,
Start!]

178
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:25,030
How are we supposed to
run on this thing?

179
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:31,870
[Training himself to get used to
the feel of the mat under his feet.]

180
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:36,580
If our feet start to bleed,
does it count as having succeeded?

181
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:37,850
It doesn't?

182
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,870
You have to get all the way over here
within 10 seconds.

183
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:42,530
Ten seconds?

184
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:44,900
[Will he be able to pull it off?]

185
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:50,340
[The Blue Team is now ready!]

186
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,000
[Allotted time is 45 seconds.]

187
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,160
<i>Three.</i>

188
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:09,110
Wow, he's so fast!

189
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:13,750
[Lightning fast speed!]

190
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:16,320
[Unbelievable!]

191
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:20,760
[How is he running that fast
on the acupuncture mat?]

192
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:23,150
[Oh no!
He dropped the baton!]

193
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:29,330
[Rule- If the baton is dropped,
they must pick it up to go on.]

194
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,160
He's doing so great.
Look at how fast he's running.

195
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,380
Be careful!

196
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:38,270
[Lightly... jumps over the vaulting horse.]

197
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,060
- Hey! Doesn't it hurt?
- Amazing.

198
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:43,930
- Doesn't it hurt your feet?
- How is he doing that?

199
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:47,400
[Passing off the baton to Yoo Hyuk!]

200
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:52,890
[Could this acupuncture mat not be
as painful as the previous ones?]

201
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:55,360
[No, it is one and the same.]

202
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,880
You can do it, Jae Suk!

203
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:00,800
Don't stop!

204
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:02,930
You have to keep telling yourself
that it's not painful!

205
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:07,100
[The second course-
Pass the tunnel of netting!]

206
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:11,370
[Feeling the effects of the
acupuncture mat with his whole body.]

207
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:12,490
This is just wrong!

208
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:15,640
- How am I supposed to do that?
- How am I going to do that?

209
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,210
Kwang Soo!

210
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:18,900
- Kwang Soo!
- You're going off the course!

211
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:21,930
Jae Suk! You're on the grass!
You can't go that way.

212
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:23,920
Jae Suk, you have to get back
on the thorny mat!

213
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:28,080
Just a bit more!
Move a little bit more!

214
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:35,570
[Is he trying to shoot a scene from
'The Shawshank Redemption'?]

215
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:39,440
I feel like my back is starting to bleed!

216
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:41,320
- Kwang Soo!
- A little bit more!

217
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:45,360
[No longer able to just stand by and watch,
Kwang Soo rushes in to help.]

218
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:51,390
[A new concept- The lending hand.]

219
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:56,050
[Blue Team's third runner,
Kwang Soo- Go!]

220
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:01,780
[Kwang Soo is pretty fast on his own!]

221
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:10,370
[The third course-
Eat the cookie hanging on the horizontal bar.]

222
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:28,120
[Oh no...]

223
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:34,740
[Crashes on the acupuncture mat
with the weight of his whole body.]

224
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,690
Oh no!

225
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:39,400
- Oh no, Kwang Soo!
- It hurts so bad!

226
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,070
The wind!

227
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:46,560
The wind is blowing the cookie away.

228
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:52,100
- Why can't you do a better job of that?
- There you go.

229
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:55,730
That's not what a flower boy
is supposed to look like.

230
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:57,850
[Barely succeeds in eating the cookie.]

231
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:01,970
I bet we took five minutes.

232
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:03,400
[Blue Team- Finish!]

233
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,110
<i>Blue Team's record is...</i>

234
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:07,470
<i>Three minutes and ten seconds.</i>

235
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:10,610
[45 seconds to succeed.
Blue Team's record- 3 minutes and 10 seconds.]

236
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:17,120
<i>First runner, Kim Soo Young finished
his portion in 17 seconds.</i>

237
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,910
[Record for first runner,
Soo Hyun was 17 seconds!]

238
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:23,140
Even with the 17 seconds,
that's still not enough to succeed.

239
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:26,200
So Soo Hyun needs to step it up
and shorten his time quite a bit?

240
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,640
In order for us to do it within 45 seconds,
you have to do your portion in 10 seconds.

241
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:33,290
In some ways, you could say
that our losing was your fault.

242
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,690
- Soo Hyun, let's step it up a notch, okay?
- Yes, I'll step it up a notch.

243
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:39,190
You have to shorten it
by about five seconds, Soo Hyun.

244
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:40,870
[You worked hard, flower boy...]

245
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,000
It hurts, doesn't it?
It hurts but you're enduring it, right?

246
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,390
- Right? Yes, you have to endure the pain.
- But...

247
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:48,800
- That mat really does hurt.
- But when you kneel down once you're done...

248
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:51,680
I can feel all the blood in my body
circulating throughout.

249
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,310
It means that it's good for you.

250
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:55,550
- It's because it's good for your health.
- That sensation means it's good for you.

251
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:02,210
[Next up is the Green Team's turn.]

252
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:03,780
I remember this sensation all over again.

253
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:06,330
- Is it really hard and rigid?
- Oh yeah.

254
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,220
How am I going to do this?
I'm in big trouble.

255
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:12,120
[Green Team is ready to go!]

256
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:19,850
[First runner Gary's wriggle run.]

257
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:21,460
- Gary!
- Gary!

258
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,020
That's normal.

259
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:28,970
That's normal.

260
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:40,830
[Barely makes it to the second runner
of the Green Team, Ji Hyo.]

261
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,470
Ji Hyo!

262
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:49,210
[Ji Hyo gets off to a strong start!]

263
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,050
Ji Hyo, are you okay?

264
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:56,650
[That's nothing for our Ace.]

265
00:14:56,650 --> 00:14:58,290
I know how much that hurts.

266
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:02,510
[Second Course- Pass through the netting!]

267
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:08,360
- This hurts!
- What do we do?

268
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:12,300
- Ow, that hurts!
- Just endure it!

269
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,350
Just think that there's gold
waiting right behind you.

270
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:17,010
I think my back is starting to bleed!

271
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,320
You're really going to get it from me
if you're slower than Ji Hyo.

272
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:23,590
There he goes again.
He's threatening you again?

273
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,360
They haven't even started their turn yet,
and he's already angry.

274
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:29,180
Why are you so angry already
when you guys haven't even started yet?

275
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:32,600
- I get angry when I just think about it.
- He's like a ball of anger right now.

276
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:35,490
Why are you the one getting angry
when another team is having their turn?

277
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:37,620
I don't know, but I'm angry.
Make sure that you do it right!

278
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:39,630
I haven't even done anything yet.

279
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:45,940
[Green Team's third runner,
Big-nose Brother... Go!]

280
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:48,190
What is he doing?
Is he walking?

281
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:53,470
[Just a faster paced walk.]

282
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:55,600
Father!

283
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:58,660
Will you give your daughter to me?

284
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:01,920
- No, I can't give her to you!
- Why?

285
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:08,350
- How is Suk Jin going to do that?
- You have to jump higher than you think.

286
00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:16,770
[If he's in that position...
how is he going to get to the cookie?]

287
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,850
- Why are you grabbing it there?
- You have to grab it in the middle!

288
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:21,370
[What to do...]

289
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:23,370
Father, just let go!

290
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:26,350
- Just let go.
- What do I do?

291
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:27,910
Just let go!

292
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:31,670
[What would you do if you were
stuck in this situation?]

293
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,580
Wow, even my hands hurt!

294
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,770
What is he doing?

295
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:56,210
[Green Team- Fail.]

296
00:16:56,210 --> 00:16:57,810
Suk Jin, seriously!

297
00:16:57,810 --> 00:17:00,150
But why did you get so angry when
it was the other team's turn?

298
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:02,850
[Getting angry again while watching
the other team perform.]

299
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:06,360
- How is that anything to get angry about?
- But I do feel angry.

300
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:07,440
Seriously...

301
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:10,090
That's why you should've just
given your daughter to me.

302
00:17:10,090 --> 00:17:12,780
- I can't give my daughter to you!
- Why are you being so stubborn?

303
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:14,660
My physical stamina isn't what
it used to be.

304
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:16,750
Father!

305
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:19,500
Just think of it as not being painful.
Tell yourself that it doesn't hurt.

306
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:21,530
Just hold still!

307

[Attempting to train
the second runner, Ha Ha's back.]

[Will the Red Team be able to
get it done within 45 seconds?]

- Soo Hyun, that really hurts!
- I know!

311
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:42,360
- That thing really hurts, Hyun Woo.
- My father really likes this mat.

312
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:44,460
You'll be fine.

313
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,730
[Red Team members are all ready to go!]

314
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,920
- Hyun Woo, fighting!
- Fighting!

315
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,530
- Fighting!
- Fighting!

316
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,330
- Who just made that noise?
- He did.

317
00:17:58,090 --> 00:17:59,950

- He did.</i>

318
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:03,490
[His screams keeps on getting louder
while his pace keeps on slowing down.]

319
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:05,710
His voice is getting
higher and higher pitched.

320
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:07,390
- You're doing great!
- You have to jump that carefully.

321
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:18,740
[Passing off the baton to Ha Ha,
the second runner.]

322
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,830
[As predicted...]

323
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:26,080
- He really is horrible at this.
- Jong Kook is going to kill him.

324
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:29,890
- He's awful at jumping those things too.
- You have to go faster!

325
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:34,320
It's all over.
Jong Kook is really angry.

326
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,900
- Jong Kook is on fire.
- You have to move faster!

327
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:38,510
- Jong Kook is really angry right now.
- I told you to endure it!

328
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,340
Run!
Ha Ha, you have to run!

329
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:42,660
- Run faster!
- Yes, Sir!

330
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:44,020
Lie down on your back!

331
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:47,510
[Second course- Pass the netting!]

332
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:51,690
Quickly, quickly!
Move faster!

333
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:54,650
[Like a frozen block of ice.]

334
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:57,700
It hurts!

335
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:01,560
[Relaxed spectators all thanks to Ha Ha.]

336
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,610
- You have to move faster!
- Come on, Ha Ha!

337
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:08,050
[He's on the move!
Mr. Capable, Jong Kook!]

338
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:11,890
[Mr. Capable's speed!]

339
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:18,780
[Running at lightning speed as if
he's running down a flat surface!]

340
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:23,070
[Makes it all the way to the
horizontal bar in no time at all!]

341
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,930
[Is he even human?]

342
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:29,510
- Fall in, fall in!
- Drop the cookie, drop the cookie!

343
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:31,470
Drop the cookie, drop the cookie!

344
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:39,880
[Red Team- Finish!]

345
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,980
- He's not human.
- He's the terminator.

346
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:45,070
- He's the terminator, Gary.
- I felt like I was watching a movie.

347
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:47,680
If you think that it doesn't hurt,
then it doesn't hurt.

348
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,790
Come here.
You come here right now.

349
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,680
He's your second runner.

350
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:53,310
That kid, seriously...

351
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:55,220
- Let me see the soles of your feet.
- Hang on a second.

352
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:57,030
[Why does he want to see
the bottoms of Ha Ha's feet?]

353
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:00,000
We need to condition your feet,
so let me see the bottoms of your feet.

354
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,080
- Pick up your feet.
- Let me see your feet.

355
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:07,600
You just need to get used to it!
It doesn't hurt once you're used to it.

356
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,830
It doesn't hurt once you're used to it.
Get used to it and it won't hurt at all!

357
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:16,290
- Hyun Woo... it's your turn, Hyun Woo.
- But I ran as fast as I could.

358
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:18,550
- But I ran as fast as I could.
- But you still need to condition your feet.

359
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:19,790
Running fast isn't everything.

360
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:21,850
- You're going to thank us for it later.
- Jong Kook.

361
00:20:21,850 --> 00:20:23,490
- You have to treat us the same.
- What?

362
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:24,690
You have to treat him exactly
the way you treat me.

363
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:26,080
<i> Do you think you can get it done
within 45 seconds?</i>

364
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,150
- No, we can't.
- You have to give us some more time.

365
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:30,620
- I think we need a full minute.
- Give us two and a half minutes.

366
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:32,090
- I'll give you one minute.
- Okay, one minute.

367
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:34,890
- Why are you two deciding everything?
- Hang on a second.

368
00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:36,820
Why are you two making that decision?

369
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:39,410
- What are you two doing?
- Why are you two deciding everything?

370
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:42,740
Why are you saying one minute when
they were about to give us more time?

371
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:45,780
I think they were about to give us
a minute and a half.

372
00:20:46,290 --> 00:20:48,420
- We should be happy with the minute.
- Why don't you listen to what we say?

373
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:49,640
Let's do a minute and a half.

374
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,580
- They were about to give us more time.
- Let's go with a minute and a half.

375
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:54,260
[We were going to give them 90 seconds...]

376
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:56,270
- It's good to challenge ourselves.
- Are you okay with a minute?

377
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:58,080
- We're good with a minute.
- Then let's go with a minute.

378
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,080
- This is seriously unbelievable.
- He drives me crazy.

379
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:04,860
[In the end, they get 15 extra seconds,
and settle for a minute.]

380
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:09,600
[Allotted time - 60 seconds.
Blue Team's Soo Hyun ready to go.]

381
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,310
[Blue Team's Giraffe- Second runner.]

382
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:12,650
[Blue Team's third runner- Yoo Hyuk.]

383
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:15,700
- Kim Soo Hyun, fighting!
- Fighting!

384
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:18,070
<i>Okay, ready!</i>

385
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:19,840
<i>Set!</i>

386
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:23,090
Stay strong, Kwang Soo!

387
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,490
[An even faster speed!]

388
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:29,870
We're going to do this!

389
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:32,600
[Lightly jumps over the vaulting horse!]

390
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:36,740
[Blue Team's second runner,
Kwang Soo- Go!]

391
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:38,960
Kwang Soo!

392
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:39,980
[Pretty fast!]

393
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:42,360
You have to get through it, Kwang Soo!

394
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:44,870
[The problem is the netting course!]

395
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:51,610
Come over here.
You're doing good.

396
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,100
He's still pretty fast.

397
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:59,150
Kwang Soo, you have to come this way.
You have to come this way.

398
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:00,470
Where are you going?
It's this way.

399
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:03,060
That's not the right way!
You have to come this way!

400
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:06,470
This way, this way.
That's right.

401
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:09,780
[Kwang Soo got through
the net at a record time!]

402
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:11,350
[Third runner, Yoo Hyuk- Go!]

403
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:16,160
They may be able to get it done.

404
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:21,760
- Are you okay, Kwang Soo?
- My back is bleeding.

405
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,760
[Almost at the third course,
the horizontal bar!]

406
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,380
[Aren't you going to eat the cookie?]

407
00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:43,470
- How are you going to eat the cookie?
- What about the cookie?

408
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:49,770
[All he thought about was making it easier
on himself to grab the horizontal bar.]

409
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:52,000
You have to eat the cookie.
You can't hold the baton with your mouth.

410
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:57,420
[If you stick it under your armpit,
how are you going to grab the bar?]

411
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:04,130
[See how simple that was?]

412
00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:09,160
[Blue Team- Finish.]

413
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,600
That may have done it.

414
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,530
- Are you sure you're not stupid?
- Blue Team's record is...

415
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:15,060
- You need 60 seconds to succeed.
- Yes, that's right.

416
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:17,610
<i>Blue Team's record is 88 seconds.</i>

417
00:23:17,610 --> 00:23:19,210
Yeah!

418
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:25,740
My team is full of idiots.

419
00:23:26,410 --> 00:23:28,220
He's nothing but a good looking idiot.

420
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:34,100
[Automatic reaction from having firmly
believed that they were going to win.]

421
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:35,650
[Embarrassed]

422
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:38,660
If we had gone with the 90 seconds,
we would've succeeded.

423
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:41,420
But it's 60 seconds. You can do it
within 60 seconds the next time.

424
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:44,580
If I hadn't...
Can't we leave this out?

425
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:45,720
Are you sure you're not stupid?

426
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,980
What were you thinking putting the baton in
your mouth when you have to eat the cookie?

427
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:50,820
- You never think.
- Were you not thinking or what?

428
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:53,020
- What were you doing?
- My head...

429
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:56,630
- My head... it's not very clever.
- No, it's not, is it?

430
00:23:57,150 --> 00:24:00,120
You have to hold it like this.
This would've been easier.

431
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:01,820
Put out your hands.

432
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:03,260
- I said, put out your hands.
- You don't have to hit me.

433
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:05,930
You should go and take a
beating too, Father.

434
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:09,740
- Why are you standing over here?
- I'm going to stay out of it.

435
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:13,650
If you need to little pick-me-up,
let me know.

436
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:16,960
- Is the Red Team ready?
- Yes.

437
00:24:16,970 --> 00:24:18,010
[Red Team members- Ready!]

438
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:24,060
- He's actually running pretty fast.
- Dong Hoon! Run straight forward!

439
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:27,900
[Unbelievably frightening team where the
coach is even telling them how to run.]

440
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:30,340
There you go!
Jump it.

441
00:24:30,370 --> 00:24:32,970
There you go!
There you go!

442
00:24:33,730 --> 00:24:35,420
Hurry up!

443
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:40,330
[If he had only jumped the vault better,
he would've been quite fast...]

444
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:45,010
He doesn't even have the time to
bump his butt.

445
00:24:46,410 --> 00:24:48,060
Wow, he's just flying over here.

446
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:51,200
[Red Team's second runner-
Mr. Capable Jong Kook.]

447
00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:54,800
[Makes it all the way to the netting already
in crazy speed of light!]

448
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:00,750
You're going off the course!

449
00:25:04,990 --> 00:25:07,530
No!
You have to go towards the left.

450
00:25:07,530 --> 00:25:10,210
[Even goes through the netting course
at lightning speed.]

451
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:15,070
[Finally passes the baton off to
the runner, Hyun Woo!]

452
00:25:15,970 --> 00:25:19,350
[Even though he's making a lot of ruckus,
his footsteps are fast and light!]

453
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:21,030
I think they're going to do it.
If he gets that cookie fast, they got it.

454
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:23,280
As long as he can get that cookie quickly.

455
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:31,540
I think they're going to get it.

456
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:34,650
[Red Team- Finish!]

457
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:39,000
[Besides for Ha Ha's slight fumble,
the team made it through very quickly!]

458
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:41,830
Your feet hurts, don't they?
Are you okay?

459
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:44,390
<i>Here is your record.</i>

460
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,820
<i>The Red Team's record is...</i>

461
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:49,400
[Allotted time is 60 seconds!
Red Team's record is...]

462
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,050
<i>A minute and three seconds!</i>

463
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:53,820
[Allotted time is 60 seconds!
Red Team's record is 63 seconds!]

464
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:04,870
[Over the time limit by three seconds.
If it hadn't been for Ha Ha's fumble...]

465
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:08,840
- That was just a mistake.
- Come out here.

466
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:11,410
[Soo Hyun practicing for the second course.]

467
00:26:12,010 --> 00:26:13,500
- Faster! You have to move faster!
- Soo Hyun...

468
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:15,230
You have to do it without your jacket.

469
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:20,270
[Look at that giraffe!]

470
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:23,380
[He looks like a little lizard.]

471
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:25,810
- Kwang Soo.
- You should go around like that all day.

472
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,730
[Haroro on the other hand
is still getting scolded.]

473
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:36,860
- Does it hurt or not?
- It hurts! No, it doesn't hurt!

474
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:38,360
It doesn't hurt!

475
00:26:43,430 --> 00:26:46,840
[Blue Team members- Ready!]

476
00:26:47,450 --> 00:26:50,380
[Blue Team's first runner- Yoo Hyuk.]

477
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:53,090
[Blue Team's second runner- Giraffe.]

478
00:26:53,090 --> 00:26:55,030
[Blue Team's third runner- Soo Hyun.]

479
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:02,190
[Conditioning his feet is now complete!
Moving at a fast speed!]

480
00:27:04,330 --> 00:27:06,420
[With the baton firmly in his mouth.]

481
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:08,590
Be careful!

482
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:10,770
- Nice!
- Wow, he's fast.

483
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:13,570
[Second runner, Giraffe- Go!]

484
00:27:13,570 --> 00:27:15,440
- They might make it.
- Fall down!

485
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,810
See?
Their feet are now used to the sensation.

486
00:27:17,810 --> 00:27:19,000
[No more feelings left on their feet!
Unbelievable speed!]

487
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:23,040
[Here comes the lizard!]

488

- Kwang Soo!

- Fighting!
- Look at how fast he is!

496
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:46,820
- He's so fast.
- I think they're going to make it.

497
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:50,760
Come on!

498
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:53,050
[Almost falls off the bar!]

499
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:56,680
- He's stuck! They're stuck right here!
- He's having a hard time with it!

500

[Taking too long!]

- No.
- You don't need it?

There are three numbered cards
as you can see in front of you.

516

- We don't know which is good or bad?
- No, we can't tell you that.

[Just pick one card and get on the way!]

518

Do you think it's better or worse
to have the greater number?

519
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:08,420
- Don't you think greater the better?
- Okay, let's take the greater number.

520

[Blue Team chooses the number five!]

521

[What role will this number
end up playing in the end?]

522
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:20,680
- Higher number is better, right?
- We don't know if it'll be good or bad.

523
00:29:20,690 --> 00:29:22,520
- What should we do?
- Let's go with the higher number.

524
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:24,030
You can pick.

525
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:26,710
No, why doesn't Ha Ha choose it instead?
So I can blame him for it later.

526
00:29:31,030 --> 00:29:34,160
[Ha Ha chooses number three
for the Red Team!]

527

[Green Team gains number one!]

528
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,620
- Do you think we'll even come close today?
- Don't worry so much.

529
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:44,290
- Father...
- But I still oppose you with her!

530
00:29:44,290 --> 00:29:46,810
Please stop saying that.
We have to go this way.

531
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:51,070
- We're still doing okay, Father.
- At least we're still on the plus side.

532

I'm feeling more confident now.

534
00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:05,350

- Kwang Soo? No, no.

535

[Jae Suk discourages the idea of Kwang Soo
lowering his speech to Soo Hyun again.]

536
00:30:10,370 --> 00:30:12,020
- But we've already lowered our speech...
- I don't think it's time for that yet.

537
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:17,390
[He lowered his speech during the games,
but is now back to using formal speech.]

538
00:30:20,490 --> 00:30:23,120
- But it really was disappointing earlier.
- Right?

539
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:27,380
[The purpose of the numbered cards
that they can't figure out the meaning to.]

540
00:30:28,050 --> 00:30:31,460
So we don't know if it's better to have
the higher or the lower number?

- This is...
- Are we going to be flying now?

You may be calling this the
Flower Boy Athletic Competition

547
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:00,050
but what the heck is this now?

548
00:31:00,050 --> 00:31:02,590
It really is nice weather
to be flying through the air.

549
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:05,030
It's a nice day to go in the water.

The Iron Man is getting too much of
a beating from the Hulk.

554

Then why don't you start playing
the game like the Iron Man?

I saw him do it.

558

I was really shocked by his behavior.

going to hit you from the back?

652
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:11,190
[Iron Man?]

653
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,910
[Batman?]

654
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:17,380
[The relaxed finale with them
getting into their pose.]

655
00:37:23,230 --> 00:37:26,930
Jong Kook... I couldn't stand the way
he looked when he flew into the air.

656
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:31,540
- The way he punched the air.
- He's like the muscle bat.

657
00:37:32,970 --> 00:37:35,100
[Fly, muscle bat!]

658
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:44,800
[Green Team moves onto the final round
with Big-nose Brother's lucky play!]

659
00:37:45,250 --> 00:37:46,420
Are we up now?

660
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:47,960
- Kwang Soo!
- Yes, Jae Suk!

661
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,770
Let's fly.

662
00:37:50,530 --> 00:37:52,700
[That look is...]

663
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:54,600
Are you a judo player?

664
00:37:55,970 --> 00:37:57,920
[Ninth level in judo.]

665
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,350
Are you a judo player or something?

666
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:02,560
I think it would work just as well
having Jong Kook throw us in.

667
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,880
[If the chair breaks down,
then Jong Kook can throw them in.]

668
00:38:05,290 --> 00:38:07,210
- Don't worry about us, Soo Hyun.
- Good luck, Ji Hyo.

669
00:38:07,210 --> 00:38:09,640
- Teach her a lesson, Soo Hyun.
- You can win this, Ji Hyo.

670
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:12,210
Just think of it as having just one
panty when you're playing a water game.

671
00:38:12,210 --> 00:38:15,070
You have to play with the mind frame
that you can't fall in the water.

672
00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:16,860
I've got no panties on.

673
00:38:17,870 --> 00:38:19,520
This is all about one panty!

674

[Five rounds of Mook-Jji-Ppa.
Finals- Start!]

675
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:25,990
- Ppa!
- Jji!

676
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:28,790
There they go!

677
00:38:30,790 --> 00:38:33,340
[This is how you fly...]

678
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:36,050
[or not to fly into the air.]

679
00:38:43,610 --> 00:38:45,790
You've taught him well.

680
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:47,800
[Jae Suk only has one pair of underwear...]

681
00:38:48,890 --> 00:38:50,200
I'm sorry!

682
00:38:51,230 --> 00:38:54,300
- You can borrow my underwear if you'd like.
- It's okay, Soo Hyun!

683
00:38:55,430 --> 00:38:57,170
It's okay, Soo Hyun.
It's not a big deal.

684
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:59,840
Then is Jae Suk not going to have any
underwear on after this today?

685
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:02,300
No!
I'm going to wear your panties!

686
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:03,960
I'm going to wear your panties!

687
00:39:07,850 --> 00:39:09,760
It's okay, Soo Hyun!
You're doing fine.

688
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,300
[Green Team:1 vs. Blue Team:0]

689
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:12,850
- Soo Hyun, fighting!
- Yes!

690
00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:15,470
Paper, rock, scissors!

691
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,390
Ppa!

692
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:20,040
Jji!

693
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:22,230
- Soo Hyun, don't...
- Ppa!

694
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:24,410
Soo Hyun!

695
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:29,530
[They barely got back into their seats...]

696
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:32,670
- You raised your daughter very well!
- She's got everything!

697
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:34,920
- Yes, she does.
- That's why I can't give her to you.

698
00:39:38,370 --> 00:39:41,270
[A totally different expression on his face
after Soo Hyun's second loss in a row.]

699
00:39:42,770 --> 00:39:44,470
Let's do it and see who wins!

700
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:46,140
- Soo Hyun.
- Yes?

701
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:49,500
Don't worry about this...
and try it one more time.

702
00:39:50,710 --> 00:39:51,900
Huh?
What?

703
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:53,980
What's wrong with my pants?

704
00:39:53,990 --> 00:39:55,320
[The line on his wet pants...]

705
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:58,280
Is there a problem?

706
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:03,560
[His self-confidence in his behind
explodes again.]

707
00:40:03,850 --> 00:40:05,400
[Oh my!]

708
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:07,550
He thinks that's sexy.

709
00:40:07,550 --> 00:40:09,150
What are you doing?

710
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:10,580
- Why?
- Seriously!

711
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:13,680
- What's wrong with the way I came up?
- Does he think that he's sexy?

712
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:15,710
- Soo Hyun?
- Yes?

713
00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:17,550
- Don't be burdened by this.
- Get your head on straight!

714
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:19,170
I've only got one pair of panties.

715
00:40:20,210 --> 00:40:22,460
Look at the back of Ji Hyo's head.

716
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:25,660
[The two need to get closer
so that they can't see from the back.]

717
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:29,570
What is she doing?

718
00:40:29,970 --> 00:40:34,390
[Ji Hyo's towel...]

719

[is around my shoulders.]

[Seriously...]

721

She plays her games very seriously.

722
00:40:50,910 --> 00:40:53,940
What are you doing, Song Ji Hyo?

723
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:57,760
[Using the game as an excuse
to have a towel date?]

724
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,500
That Song Ji Hyo, seriously!

725
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:04,900
Why are they having so much fun
playing Paper-rock-scissors?

726

729
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:20,450
Nice, Soo Hyun!

730
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:23,100
[Did Ji Hyo all of a sudden
weaken her resolve?]

731
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:24,420
Make her heart beat even faster!

732
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:30,010
[Did she get all shaken up
by the towel move?]

733
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:33,080
- Why don't you try it, Jae Suk?
- Should I give it a try?

734
00:41:34,050 --> 00:41:35,950
- Okay, Ji Hyo.
- Hey, Ji Hyo...

735

[Blue Team switches out their player
with Jae Suk.]

736
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:38,610
He's going to throw out a paper first.

00:41:44,390 --> 00:41:48,130
- What?
- I can't stand looking at you this close up!

738

Listen to her!
She really is something else!

739

Seriously!

740

It's a mind game.
I'm playing mind games with her!

[Planning on giving her a
mental breakdown.]

Don't get flustered by him.

744
00:42:09,590 --> 00:42:13,110
Even after all these years,
I still can't get used to that sight.

745

Yes, keep reporting every
step of the game.

- Here, Kwang Soo.
- Do you want another chance?

780
00:44:11,810 --> 00:44:13,280
It's because the towel is all wet.

781
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:16,120
Even with it wet, you still
shouldn't have fallen that hard.

782

00:46:36,190 --> 00:46:37,980
- Lower your speech now.
- Soo Hyun!

823
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:42,470
I can now finally address my younger
brother as my younger brother!

824
00:46:45,030 --> 00:46:47,390
- I haven't been able to do it all morning!
- Don't do it.

825
00:46:47,390 --> 00:46:48,960
I said, don't do it.

826
00:46:48,980 --> 00:46:50,510
Don't lower your speech with him yet.

827
00:46:51,340 --> 00:46:54,490
[Now that he's gotten past Jae Suk,
Jong Kook steps forward.]

828
00:46:54,490 --> 00:46:55,750
- What?
- You can't lower your speech.

829
00:46:55,750 --> 00:46:58,690
Then why don't you play a round
with Jong Kook too?

830
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:02,150
If I win, why don't you start
using honorifics towards me too?

831
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:04,400
That's not a bad idea!

832
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:06,790
Really?
Fine. Yes, let's do that.

833
00:47:09,410 --> 00:47:13,360
[A honorifics Mook-Jji-Ppa game
out of the blue.]

834
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:15,950
If I win, then we both use honorifics.

835
00:47:15,950 --> 00:47:19,660
But if you win,
I'll keep using honorifics with Soo Hyun.

836
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:21,860
- Okay, let's do this.
- Wow, I really want to win this.

837
00:47:22,770 --> 00:47:25,200
Paper, rock, scissors!
Paper, paper!

838
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:27,210
That's a scissors!

839
00:47:27,210 --> 00:47:29,040
I can't believe I lost to him.

840
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:32,940
Mook!

841
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:38,590
Ppa!

842
00:47:42,330 --> 00:47:44,000
Look at the girth of his arm!

843
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,830
[Even though it's an added game,
all the attention is focused on it!]

844
00:47:48,180 --> 00:47:49,390
Jji!

845
00:47:49,850 --> 00:47:52,740
I'm going to call Soo Hyun
by his name!

846
00:47:56,190 --> 00:47:58,820
Mook! Mook!
Mook! Jji!

847
00:47:59,860 --> 00:48:01,020
Jji!

848
00:48:01,970 --> 00:48:04,670
[Honorifics bet- Jong Kook loses!]

849
00:48:08,370 --> 00:48:12,000
[Kwang Soo can now lower his speech to
Soo Hyun and have Jong Kook use honorifics!]

850
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,090
Okay, let's go now.

851
00:48:13,130 --> 00:48:15,200
[Everyone rushing to go before
the Tiger gets out of the water.]

852
00:48:19,130 --> 00:48:21,620
- How about the higher number this time?
- Don't you think the higher would be better?

853
00:48:21,620 --> 00:48:23,470
Let's take this one.

854
00:48:23,470 --> 00:48:25,650
Then we'll take this one.

855
00:48:25,660 --> 00:48:27,800
<i>You can now go on to your
next location.</i>

856
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:30,100
[Green Team- 5, Blue Team- 3, Red Team- 1.]

857
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:33,510
[What do these numbers mean?]

858
00:48:33,510 --> 00:48:37,100
<i>Go to the mural village in Hwajeondong
and find the Running Man landmark.</i>

859
00:48:40,540 --> 00:48:43,510
[Giraffe happy to be able to
lower his speech to Soo Hyun.]

860
00:48:43,510 --> 00:48:44,970
- Soo Hyun.
- Yes?

861
00:48:44,970 --> 00:48:46,820
What kind of nicknames do you have?

862
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:51,260
There was a nickname that I gave myself
back when I was in elementary school.

863
00:48:51,260 --> 00:48:52,930
- Nickname you gave yourself?
- You gave yourself a nickname?

864
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:54,120
What was it?

865
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:57,100
- Well my name is so feminine...
- Yes, Soo Hyun.

866
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:59,980
I think that used to bother me a lot.

867
00:48:59,980 --> 00:49:02,920
So I nicknamed myself... Soo Man.

868
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:07,940
That really seems...
fitting of an elementary school kid.

869
00:49:08,420 --> 00:49:10,840
Soo Man.
Because you wanted to be more manly?

870
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:12,690
So you nicknamed yourself Soo Man.
Kim Soo Man?

871
00:49:12,690 --> 00:49:15,120
- Yes, Kim Soo Man.
- You nicknamed yourself 'Soo Man'.

872
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:16,280
Kim Soo Man.

873
00:49:16,830 --> 00:49:20,170
Good looking kids like Soo Hyun
usually don't have many nicknames.

874
00:49:20,470 --> 00:49:21,970
You had some, didn't you, Kwang Soo?

875
00:49:22,350 --> 00:49:23,950
I used to get called a Q-tip.

876
00:49:24,910 --> 00:49:27,560
[Q-tip]

877
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:29,660
[Hwanjeondong Mural Village]

878
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:36,950
[A place full of beautiful murals
all throughout the village.]

879
00:49:38,940 --> 00:49:40,820
I wonder what we'll be doing here.

880
00:49:44,590 --> 00:49:45,660
This is so cool.

881
00:49:45,660 --> 00:49:48,300
[A village market...]

882
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:50,520
[And there's lady Dong Wan.]

883
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:51,990
Hello.

884
00:49:51,990 --> 00:49:53,830
- Ma'am!
- Here, take your mission.

885
00:49:56,410 --> 00:49:58,700
Three courses.
In the order of arrival.

886
00:49:58,700 --> 00:50:02,480
<i>[Complete your mission that's given to you by
lady Dong Wan and come back once complete.]</i>

887
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:06,930
<i>[But only those that arrive first can go!
The team whose members all pass first wins.]</i>

888
00:50:06,930 --> 00:50:08,230
Dong Wan!

889
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:10,010
Here, take your mission.

890
00:50:12,130 --> 00:50:14,380
- It's lady Dong Wan.
- I want an ice cream too.

891
00:50:14,380 --> 00:50:15,590
Give me one too.

892
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:18,110
<i>It'll be chaotic once the mission starts.</i>

893
00:50:18,110 --> 00:50:21,020
<i>Hyun Woo has the money.
Ask him to buy it for you.</i>

894
00:50:21,020 --> 00:50:23,740
- Hyun Woo.
- Don't, Hyun Woo. Don't give them any.

895
00:50:23,740 --> 00:50:25,180
Give me the money.

896
00:50:25,220 --> 00:50:27,660
You borrowed it from the
producer, didn't you?

897
00:50:29,180 --> 00:50:32,860
[Bingo- Forcefully borrowed the money
from PD Myuk earlier.]

898
00:50:33,430 --> 00:50:36,560
- When did Gary go in there?
- Does he have any money?

899
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:38,040
He has money?

900
00:50:38,050 --> 00:50:40,640
- Do you have money?
- Did you get some money?

901
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:43,370
They don't even have any money.
They're in trouble now.

902
00:50:46,420 --> 00:50:49,480
- Where did you get this?
- I just assumed Hyun Woo would buy it.

903
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:51,730
They have everything here.
Which one do you want?

904
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:53,860
Thanks, Hyun Woo!

905
00:50:54,710 --> 00:50:56,920
I'll show you what it means
to get them.

906
00:50:58,570 --> 00:51:01,190
[Can't hear you!
You wouldn't not pay for us, would you?]

907
00:51:02,310 --> 00:51:03,930
- You're in trouble, Gary.
- Why?

908
00:51:05,990 --> 00:51:07,000
Why?

909
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,010
[Absolutely clueless.]

910
00:51:10,470 --> 00:51:11,940
[Why am I in trouble?]

911
00:51:12,980 --> 00:51:15,510
- What is it, Gary?
- I have no idea!

912
00:51:15,510 --> 00:51:16,960
- He says we're in trouble.
- Why?

913
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:19,280
- I don't know.
- I have no idea.

914
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:20,840
Here, have a seat.

915
00:51:20,850 --> 00:51:23,170
You probably think that
I'm paying for you, right?

916
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:25,900
I'll show you how to get them.

917
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:29,030
[Say what?]

918
00:51:32,750 --> 00:51:34,970
<i>Can you go ask Kim Jong Kook
for the money?</i>

919
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:39,200
[Giraffe is telling on the owner?]

920
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:40,760
Ask Jong Kook for the money.

921
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:42,620
Ma'am, how much is it for all this?

922
00:51:42,620 --> 00:51:44,040
- Jong Kook.
- Yes?

923
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:47,040
You have to pay for the ice cream.

924
00:51:51,330 --> 00:51:54,030
[I was told to get the money from you.]

925
00:51:54,940 --> 00:51:56,720
[Who knew the owner would come out
and ask to be paid herself!]

926
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:58,170
I don't have the money!

927
00:51:58,890 --> 00:52:01,650
You have to pay me.
He says you have the money.

928
00:52:01,650 --> 00:52:05,140
They're the ones eating it.
It really isn't for me to pay, Ma'am.

929
00:52:05,140 --> 00:52:06,570
[Encouraging her to get even
closer to him.]

930
00:52:06,570 --> 00:52:08,460
I told my mom on you!

931
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:10,690
Mom!
It's him!

932
00:52:10,690 --> 00:52:13,220
Mother.
Come on, Mother.

933
00:52:13,950 --> 00:52:17,060
See the red clothes?
My team is dressed in red.

934
00:52:17,060 --> 00:52:19,110
The ones dressed in blue
aren't my team.

935
00:52:19,910 --> 00:52:22,980
Come on, don't be like that.
You're a good looking boy!

936
00:52:24,290 --> 00:52:26,410
Hurry up and pay her.
She wants to get paid.

937
00:52:27,230 --> 00:52:29,670
[Ultimately ends up handing
her the money.]

938
00:52:30,710 --> 00:52:33,970
They just went in and took it
without even asking.

939
00:52:33,970 --> 00:52:36,270
Just take that and bring him
back the change.

940
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:38,310
You don't have to see
Kim Jong Kook again.

941
00:52:39,290 --> 00:52:40,440
Mother!

942
00:52:41,380 --> 00:52:43,000
- I'm going to upload it.
- Excuse me?

943
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,630
If you keep that up,
I'm uploading your picture.

944
00:52:46,340 --> 00:52:49,060
[Chastising Kkuk for his endless arguing.]

945
00:52:49,060 --> 00:52:50,670
I'm not responsible for them!

946
00:52:50,670 --> 00:52:53,510
[A smart world where people
can easily get exposed.]

947
00:52:56,300 --> 00:53:00,140
- They're not even my team!
- Even ladies know how to do everything now.

948
00:53:01,420 --> 00:53:03,400
That was quick thinking.

949
00:53:03,710 --> 00:53:06,040
[Nervous...]

950
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:07,360
Excuse me!

951
00:53:07,940 --> 00:53:09,180
You come over here.

952
00:53:10,270 --> 00:53:12,490
- You're supposed to use honorifics!
- What did you say?

953
00:53:12,490 --> 00:53:14,330
- What are you doing?
- My mom!

954
00:53:14,330 --> 00:53:15,960
[She was watching!]

955
00:53:18,610 --> 00:53:20,240
- Take the picture!
- Mother.

956
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:21,510
Mother!

957
00:53:21,510 --> 00:53:22,910
[It's not like that.]

958
00:53:23,770 --> 00:53:27,000
[Unbelievable timing!]

959
00:53:27,410 --> 00:53:30,800
[Who knew that the citizens that live
here would be so sensible?]

960
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:33,910
Okay, let's start the mission.

961
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:35,730
[First come first serve mission-Start!]

962
00:53:36,130 --> 00:53:39,360
If you keep sitting like that,
you're going to end up with scoliosis.

963
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:41,590
You just worry about yourself!

964
00:53:41,590 --> 00:53:43,770
- Seriously!
- He hasn't been sitting like that for long.

965
00:53:43,770 --> 00:53:45,460
Just keep it to yourself!

966
00:53:45,460 --> 00:53:47,230
It's my back.
My back.

967
00:53:49,750 --> 00:53:53,320
With the weather so nice today,
I was thinking of doing some laundry.

968
00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:57,450
If you go deeper into the village, you'll find
laundry baskets with an 'R' sticker on it.

969
00:53:57,450 --> 00:53:59,680
Wring out the laundry in the basket

970
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:03,680
and hang up a piece of the laundered clothing
on the laundry line you see in front of it.

971
00:54:03,910 --> 00:54:06,050
But it's no fun if you just go
and hand it on the line, right?

972
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:08,700
You have to hang it up
with your toes.

973
00:54:08,700 --> 00:54:10,170
You have to hang it up with your toes.

974
00:54:10,170 --> 00:54:13,490
[Throw the laundry to hang it on
the line by using your toes!]

975
00:54:13,490 --> 00:54:15,590
- With your feet?
- How?

976
00:54:15,590 --> 00:54:16,750
Yes, you have to use your feet.

977
00:54:16,750 --> 00:54:19,760
If you succeed with the laundry,
you'll be giving clothing pins.

978
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:22,300
Once you're giving the pins,
you just have to bring that back to me.

979
00:54:23,050 --> 00:54:26,680
Okay, let's start the game.
It will be a first come first served basis.

980
00:54:26,690 --> 00:54:28,520
One person, go!

981
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:30,310
- What does that mean?
- First come first served.

982
00:54:30,310 --> 00:54:31,970
Just one person.
Get going!

983
00:54:31,970 --> 00:54:34,370
- How many of us can go?
- What does he mean?

984
00:54:34,370 --> 00:54:36,270
There's a total of nine of us right now.

985
00:54:36,270 --> 00:54:39,670
- We have to find the laundry basket.
- Laundry basket!

986
00:54:40,470 --> 00:54:43,070
[Soo Hyun leads the pack with
his lightning fast run.]

987
00:54:43,950 --> 00:54:45,640
Look for it carefully.

988
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:46,840
[Where is the laundry?]

989
00:54:48,330 --> 00:54:49,890
Where do you think the
laundry basket is?

990
00:54:50,290 --> 00:54:52,370
I feel like it'll be around here somewhere.

991
00:54:52,370 --> 00:54:53,800
- There it is!
- Right here!

992
00:54:55,020 --> 00:54:56,910
[Must hang it up on this line to succeed.]

993
00:54:56,910 --> 00:54:58,210
Right here?
This one?

994
00:54:58,740 --> 00:55:00,780
- On that line?
- Here it is!

995
00:55:00,780 --> 00:55:02,130
[Total of three people.
Gary can also participate.]

996
00:55:05,590 --> 00:55:08,080
[Kkuk and Giraffe also discover
the laundry area.]

997
00:55:09,420 --> 00:55:11,940
- We just have to hang it with my feet?
- After wringing them out?

998
00:55:12,530 --> 00:55:14,250
You have to be careful with
what you pick.

999
00:55:15,910 --> 00:55:18,350
[While everyone is getting ready to hang up
the laundry with their feet...]

1000
00:55:18,350 --> 00:55:21,150
[Lightning fast Soo Hyun is...]

1001
00:55:22,380 --> 00:55:24,730
[Huh?]

1002
00:55:24,730 --> 00:55:27,540
<i>There's a laundry basket with
the 'R' sticker on it.</i>

1003
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:33,040
[Where's the 'R' sticker?]

1004
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:39,480
[Was the first to run off,
but is still looking for the laundry...]

1005
00:55:40,650 --> 00:55:42,250
This is someone's house, right?

1006
00:55:46,510 --> 00:55:48,210
[Is it over there?]

1007
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:55,970
Something doesn't seem right.

1008
00:55:56,440 --> 00:55:58,580
[He's going to go around the
whole village.]

1009
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:03,690
- I can't believe what we're doing.
- We can go if we succeed?

1010
00:56:03,700 --> 00:56:05,460
I don't think this is going to work.

1011
00:56:06,370 --> 00:56:07,590
One, two...

1012
00:56:07,970 --> 00:56:10,430
[Hang it up?]

1013
00:56:10,430 --> 00:56:12,200
[No way...]

1014
00:56:17,610 --> 00:56:20,010
[Flower boy Hyun Woo's turn.]

1015
00:56:21,140 --> 00:56:22,700
I think I can do this.

1016
00:56:22,700 --> 00:56:23,760
Try it.

1017
00:56:25,080 --> 00:56:27,120
[Wow...]

1018
00:56:34,570 --> 00:56:36,070
Here I go.

1019
00:56:36,460 --> 00:56:38,750
[Ha Ha and Ji Hyo are carrying out
the mission at this site.]

1020
00:56:43,410 --> 00:56:44,890
[Darn!]

1021
00:56:44,890 --> 00:56:46,130
Challenge.

1022
00:56:46,140 --> 00:56:47,770
[Blank Ji's challenge.]

1023
00:56:50,670 --> 00:56:54,370
[What?]

1024
00:56:54,370 --> 00:56:56,270
[Too bad...]

1025
00:56:56,270 --> 00:56:57,600
I got it!

1026
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:04,600
It's first come first serve, isn't it?
I should get it done quickly.

1027
00:57:05,240 --> 00:57:06,620
Move out of the way.

1028
00:57:07,550 --> 00:57:10,920
[Giraffe waiting for a chance
from the side?]

1029
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:12,760
You're blocking the line.
Move out over here.

1030
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:14,290
- I'll just stand still.
- Move out over here.

1031
00:57:14,290 --> 00:57:15,910
I'm wringing out the laundry
to get it ready.

1032
00:57:18,190 --> 00:57:20,250
[As predicted...]

1033
00:57:26,830 --> 00:57:29,250
[He really is a Tiger eating Giraffe.]

1034
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:31,330
I'm going to try it again.

1035
00:57:33,510 --> 00:57:35,800
[Only one person can pass this,
and the Giraffe keeps interfering.]

1036
00:57:37,300 --> 00:57:41,040
[Soo Hyun finally having found
a laundry basket.]

1037
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:42,100
[Hm...]

1038
00:57:46,130 --> 00:57:47,840
[The laundry getting caught
in the tree.]

1039
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:52,310
[Second attempt.]

1040
00:57:52,310 --> 00:57:54,690
[Again!]

1041
00:57:56,290 --> 00:57:58,290
[Third attempt]

1042
00:57:58,290 --> 00:58:00,710
[In the tree again.]

1043
00:58:02,140 --> 00:58:03,970
They all keep getting caught in the tree.

1044
00:58:04,550 --> 00:58:06,960
[At least the laundry will dry well.]

1045
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:10,950
[Yoo Hyuk making his attempt.]

1046
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:17,850
[He got it caught on the line!]

1047
00:58:18,170 --> 00:58:19,880
[Success!]

1048
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:24,780
[Off to the supermarket with
the clothing pin in his hand!]

1049
00:58:30,560 --> 00:58:32,320
Just one person on
a first come first serve basis.

1050
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:35,310
That's me.

1051
00:58:37,230 --> 00:58:40,450
- Did you get the laundry hung?
- It's like the shoe throwing.

1052
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:44,430
- Have a seat over there.
- There's nothing I can't do.

1053
00:58:45,860 --> 00:58:48,150
I can't believe I got it hung
on my second attempt.

1054
00:58:49,100 --> 00:58:50,830
Ever since I was little...

1055
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:53,240
there's something my father
used to say to me.

1056
00:58:53,240 --> 00:58:55,070
He used to ask me if I used
my feet to write.

1057
00:58:55,070 --> 00:58:56,550
[He used to ask me if I wrote
with my feet...]

1058
00:58:57,580 --> 00:59:01,970
[Guess there's a reason for everything.]

1059
00:59:03,820 --> 00:59:06,210
- I got first place, Ji Hyo.
- You came in first?

1060
00:59:06,210 --> 00:59:08,750
Then there must be a lot of areas.
How many laundry areas are there?

1061
00:59:10,810 --> 00:59:13,690
There is an advantage given to
the first place winner.

1062
00:59:14,150 --> 00:59:15,320
What is it?

1063
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:16,800
Go get yourself a cookie.

1064
00:59:22,110 --> 00:59:24,700
- What?
- I'm jealous.

1065
00:59:25,230 --> 00:59:27,820
Although I'm grateful...

1066
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:32,690
But telling someone older than you to go
get himself a cookie with 2,000 won is...

1067
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,730
- This guy seriously...
- I'm jealous.

1068
00:59:37,740 --> 00:59:39,730
[Sticks it into his pocket.]

1069
00:59:40,790 --> 00:59:42,610
Of course, I'm going to eat.

1070
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:45,270
You should have a better
sense of duty.

1071
00:59:45,270 --> 00:59:46,410
Instead of finishing up so early...

1072
00:59:46,410 --> 00:59:48,440
I'll take my sense of duty
and buy myself a cookie.

1073
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:53,660
[If there was a lip battle,
he'd be the world champion.]

1074
00:59:54,510 --> 00:59:56,520
- Stop it!
- Oh no! What do I do!

1075
00:59:56,520 --> 00:59:58,650
[A bug...]

1076
00:59:58,650 --> 01:00:00,300
[Bolts out of their seats.]

1077
01:00:01,630 --> 01:00:03,880
[All the little brothers jumping out
of their seats to her rescue.]

1078
01:00:04,250 --> 01:00:07,190
She's not scared of anything
else but bugs.

1079
01:00:07,190 --> 01:00:10,570
Kwang Soo, just stay back and let
Gary go to her instead.

1080
01:00:10,570 --> 01:00:12,430
She's not yours!

1081
01:00:12,430 --> 01:00:14,880
How would you like it if I started
acting like the group idiot?

1082
01:00:15,180 --> 01:00:17,180
You're the group idiot and she's mine!

1083
01:00:17,180 --> 01:00:18,720
[Getting worked up over Kwang Soo's
confusion of their roles.]

1084
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:21,110
I'm sorry!
Please don't take my idiot role away!

1085
01:00:21,580 --> 01:00:24,620
If anything happens to Ji Hyo,
just let Gary go to her rescue!

1086
01:00:24,620 --> 01:00:26,320
I can be the idiot too!

1087
01:00:26,320 --> 01:00:28,220
[I can be the idiot too...]

1088
01:00:28,690 --> 01:00:30,250
That's my role!
Please don't do that!

1089
01:00:31,940 --> 01:00:33,600
Okay, we'll start your next mission.

1090
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:36,500
Your next mission is to eat
the refreshing watermelon.

1091
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:37,640
I love watermelon.

1092
01:00:37,640 --> 01:00:42,440
Eat the watermelon and spit out the seed
to put a mole upon your own face.

1093
01:00:43,140 --> 01:00:46,340
Up to two people can attempt the
mission at the same place.

1094
01:00:46,340 --> 01:00:50,860
You have to cross this line with the
seeds still on your face.

1095
01:00:50,870 --> 01:00:53,480
But if it falls off on your way back,
you have to go back and do it over.

1096
01:00:53,490 --> 01:00:55,340
So we have to find a close
place to do it.

1097
01:00:55,340 --> 01:00:57,870
Stop speaking up!

1098
01:00:57,870 --> 01:01:01,680
We'll take care of it ourselves.
You just stay and we'll take care of it!

1099
01:01:01,690 --> 01:01:02,980
Fine, okay.

1100
01:01:02,980 --> 01:01:06,050
Did you hear what I said, Kwang Soo and
Soo Hyun? You have to find a close location.

1101
01:01:06,050 --> 01:01:07,710
Do we have to eat
the whole piece of watermelon?

1102
01:01:07,710 --> 01:01:09,090
Seed.
Just the seed.

1103
01:01:09,090 --> 01:01:11,170
You just need to spit out the seed
to get it to stick to your face.

1104
01:01:11,170 --> 01:01:13,600
We know that!

1105
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:16,120
- You have to spit out the seed...
- We already know that!

1106
01:01:16,130 --> 01:01:17,880
[The two poor suckers stuck
between the two loud mouths.]

1107
01:01:18,490 --> 01:01:20,340
Just spit out the seed
and get it to stick on your face.

1108
01:01:20,340 --> 01:01:22,720
You're so strange!
We know what we have to do!

1109
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:25,820
The first time I ever played this game
was sometime in the mid 90's.

1110
01:01:26,630 --> 01:01:29,670
[Showing his ability to talk nonstop
without any regards to those around him.]

1111
01:01:32,910 --> 01:01:34,410
Mister!

1112
01:01:36,080 --> 01:01:38,790
[Why is he getting up?]

1113
01:01:42,020 --> 01:01:45,100
An unexpected situation just occurred
because of me.

1114
01:01:48,660 --> 01:01:50,630
- How do you run so fast?
- Where is it?

1115
01:01:51,720 --> 01:01:56,170
[Soo Hyun having run like the wind falls
behind the others from lack of direction.]

1116
01:01:57,420 --> 01:01:59,630
[Watermelon!]

1117
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:04,270
[Two people per location!]

1118
01:02:14,840 --> 01:02:16,920
[It stuck!]

1119
01:02:18,330 --> 01:02:20,260
Did it stick?
Did I get it on my face?

1120
01:02:20,260 --> 01:02:21,570
No, it didn't stick.

1121
01:02:22,230 --> 01:02:24,920
[Why is the Giraffe following him when
he hasn't even played the game yet?]

1122
01:02:28,330 --> 01:02:29,860
They're already back?

1123
01:02:31,290 --> 01:02:34,660
You have to come over to me
so that I can check it.

1124
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:38,480
Fail.

1125
01:02:41,910 --> 01:02:43,750
[Giraffe succeeds in his plan
to interfere.]

1126
01:02:43,750 --> 01:02:45,120
What is it that you brought back?

1127
01:02:45,120 --> 01:02:47,230
I saw you running back with your chin
jutting out. What was that for?

1128
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:50,530
- You have something on your neck!
- Where? On my neck?

1129
01:02:50,530 --> 01:02:52,140
[A mole on his neck that's
as big as a watermelon seed.]

1130
01:02:52,140 --> 01:02:54,270
I'm sorry, but can you just
stay out of this?

1131
01:02:54,270 --> 01:02:56,820
- Isn't that one on your neck?
- I'm trying to do a show here.

1132
01:02:56,820 --> 01:02:59,290
On your neck over there.
Seriously.

1133
01:02:59,650 --> 01:03:01,450
What is that thing on your neck?

1134
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:09,640
You got it.
It's stuck on your face.

1135
01:03:09,640 --> 01:03:10,990
[It stuck!]

1136
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:22,980
Please!
I'll give this to you.

1137
01:03:22,980 --> 01:03:25,320
- Leave that watermelon.
- Here, I'll give it to you!

1138
01:03:25,320 --> 01:03:27,200
[Begging and pleading to the Giraffe.]

1139
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:28,950
- Here, I'll give this to you.
- Spit a seed on my face.

1140
01:03:29,240 --> 01:03:31,390
[He wants Hyun Woo to spit
one on his face?]

1141
01:03:44,030 --> 01:03:46,270
[Hyun Woo drops the seed,
and heads back to the watermelon lady.]

1142
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:49,060
I got it, right?

1143
01:03:50,540 --> 01:03:53,920
[As expected, right next to his big nose.]

1144
01:03:56,050 --> 01:03:58,130
[Off to the supermarket!]

1145
01:03:58,130 --> 01:03:59,390
Hey!

1146
01:03:59,390 --> 01:04:01,170
Wow!
I'm actually the first?

1147
01:04:02,300 --> 01:04:04,120
- What the heck, Suk Jin?
- Why?

1148
01:04:04,120 --> 01:04:05,600
- Did you even get one on your face?
- It's not there?

1149
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:06,900
- I don't see it.
- It's on there.

1150
01:04:06,910 --> 01:04:08,470
- Where?
- It's not on there?

1151
01:04:08,470 --> 01:04:09,640
No, I don't see it.

1152
01:04:11,140 --> 01:04:12,490
- It's not there?
- No, I don't see it.

1153
01:04:12,500 --> 01:04:15,010
[Big-nose Brother wipes off the seed
with his own hand...]

1154
01:04:16,130 --> 01:04:17,230
Hey!

1155
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:19,800
I failed?

1156
01:04:20,360 --> 01:04:21,990
You didn't cross the line.

1157
01:04:21,990 --> 01:04:23,650
- Seriously!
- You had one on your face?

1158
01:04:24,340 --> 01:04:26,670
- Yes, there was one!
- Then you should've showed it to him.

1159
01:04:28,980 --> 01:04:31,050
[Mr. Yoo doing a good job of
interfering the other teams.]

1160
01:04:32,170 --> 01:04:35,370
[Shaking hands?]

1161
01:04:35,370 --> 01:04:36,800
Let's hold hands at the
finish line together.

1162
01:04:38,470 --> 01:04:40,690
[Tiger and Giraffe agreeing to
not to interfere with one another?]

1163
01:04:47,720 --> 01:04:49,440
Why were you just about to
give that to me?

1164
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:52,080
- Why were you about to give it to me?
- For you to play with it.

1165
01:04:52,080 --> 01:04:55,620
This feels like the supermarkets that I used
to hang around in when I was little.

1166
01:04:55,620 --> 01:04:57,410
I used to hang out in front of
a market like this all the time.

1167
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:03,510
[Tiger and the Giraffe both having succeeded
heads off to the market together.]

1168
01:05:05,330 --> 01:05:06,740
Someone's coming.

1169
01:05:07,500 --> 01:05:09,710
[Walking in together side by side.]

1170
01:05:10,270 --> 01:05:12,140
[End of their truce.]

1171
01:05:13,180 --> 01:05:14,260
- Jong Kook dropped his.
- Right here.

1172
01:05:14,260 --> 01:05:16,040
- Where is it?
- Right here.

1173
01:05:16,540 --> 01:05:18,800
Success.

1174
01:05:18,810 --> 01:05:20,350
[Giraffe also succeeds.]

1175
01:05:21,780 --> 01:05:24,490
So the others failed?
Soo Hyun and Hyun Woo...

1176
01:05:24,490 --> 01:05:27,250
[First come first serve basis.
Only Kkuk and Kwang Soo passes.]

1177
01:05:28,110 --> 01:05:30,010
[Darn!]

1178
01:05:30,010 --> 01:05:32,280
- Is it still on my face?
- Where?

1179
01:05:32,280 --> 01:05:35,900
[The watermelon seed must have
fallen off of his face again.]

1180
01:05:36,620 --> 01:05:38,910
There it is.
Fail!

1181
01:05:40,750 --> 01:05:42,420
Where is it, Soo Hyun?

1182
01:05:43,040 --> 01:05:46,900
[Even running fanatic Soo Hyun fails
even though he eagerly runs back.]

1183
01:05:46,900 --> 01:05:49,340
- Soo Hyun.
- Is it even on your face?

1184
01:05:50,530 --> 01:05:51,940
Ji Hyo.

1185
01:05:53,370 --> 01:05:55,430
- Come here, Ji Hyo.
- I got it.

1186
01:05:55,800 --> 01:05:58,210
What are you doing going around
with that watermelon in your hand?

1187
01:05:58,210 --> 01:06:01,090
I got lucky with getting it on my face.

1188
01:06:01,090 --> 01:06:03,610
- Good job though, Ji Hyo.
- None of our team made it?

1189
01:06:03,610 --> 01:06:05,780
You need to step it up a
notch, Dong Hoon!

1190
01:06:05,780 --> 01:06:07,920
You really need to get it done this time.

1191
01:06:08,380 --> 01:06:09,720
Yes, I understand.

1192
01:06:10,790 --> 01:06:13,790
You think he's just scolding me, right?
He's scolding you too.

1193
01:06:13,790 --> 01:06:15,540
You're the only one left
to succeed now, Soo Hyun.

1194
01:06:15,540 --> 01:06:17,120
- We have to stop him any way that we can.
- Let's win this, okay?

1195
01:06:17,120 --> 01:06:20,180
[Other teams need to do what they can
to stop Soo Hyun from succeeding.]

1196
01:06:20,770 --> 01:06:22,480
Okay, this is your third mission.

1197
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:25,750
- This mission is... a yogurt...
- Yogurt?

1198
01:06:26,140 --> 01:06:27,160
Were you singing that?

1199
01:06:31,260 --> 01:06:34,710
[All the neighborhood kids are
joining in on the song.]

1200
01:06:35,720 --> 01:06:37,820
It's a yogurt bowling game.

1201
01:06:37,820 --> 01:06:38,900
Bowling?

1202
01:06:39,180 --> 01:06:42,680
If you start looking around the village,
you'll find a yogurt bowling alley.

1203
01:06:42,690 --> 01:06:44,120
When you find it...

1204
01:06:44,130 --> 01:06:48,070
roll up the socks that you're wearing
to use it as your bowling ball.

1205
01:06:48,070 --> 01:06:50,220
- If you get a strike...
- I'm only wearing ankle socks.

1206
01:06:50,810 --> 01:06:53,190
- We have to stop Soo Hyun. Stop him.
- We have to stop Soo Hyun.

1207
01:06:53,190 --> 01:06:54,570
If Soo Hyun wins, the Blue Team wins.

1208
01:06:54,570 --> 01:06:57,130
First come first served.
Two people can win.

1209
01:06:57,130 --> 01:06:58,950
[First come first serve basis-
Two people per location!]

1210
01:07:00,100 --> 01:07:03,340
[Mr. Yoo trying to interfere again.]

1211
01:07:07,180 --> 01:07:08,650
He's so fast!

1212
01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:13,240
[Runner Soo Hyun leads the pack again!]

1213
01:07:15,340 --> 01:07:17,360
[He finds the bowling alley!]

1214
01:07:18,220 --> 01:07:19,320
Okay!

1215
01:07:20,970 --> 01:07:22,440
I told you to stop Soo Hyun.

1216
01:07:24,410 --> 01:07:28,000
[Now must take off their socks
to use it as their bowling ball.]

1217
01:07:30,270 --> 01:07:31,940
I'm already done.

1218
01:07:31,940 --> 01:07:33,430
Then you can go first.

1219
01:07:34,530 --> 01:07:36,620
[Hyun Woo takes the first turn.]

1220
01:07:42,810 --> 01:07:44,820
[Even though he did a good job of rolling,
he only succeeds in knocking down seven.]

1221
01:07:44,820 --> 01:07:46,050
Too bad!

1222
01:07:47,360 --> 01:07:49,780
[It's Soo Hyun's turn at last.]

1223
01:07:53,170 --> 01:07:54,920
[Huh?]

1224
01:07:56,380 --> 01:07:58,860
[Gutter ball]

1225
01:08:00,420 --> 01:08:02,290
We have to stop Soo Hyun
from winning.

1226
01:08:02,290 --> 01:08:03,940
I think he's competing against Hyun Woo.

1227
01:08:03,940 --> 01:08:06,290
- Since he's playing with Hyun Woo...
- We have to win this quickly.

1228
01:08:09,980 --> 01:08:11,930
[Oh?]

1229
01:08:12,750 --> 01:08:14,980
[Strike!]

1230
01:08:14,990 --> 01:08:17,220
Hurry up, Suk Jin!
Hurry back there!

1231
01:08:17,220 --> 01:08:18,370
Hurry!
Hurry!

1232
01:08:18,380 --> 01:08:20,420
[Back to the market with a yogurt in hand!]

1233
01:08:25,120 --> 01:08:26,500
Suk Jin!

1234
01:08:27,100 --> 01:08:28,770
- Is that Suk Jin?
- Huh?

1235
01:08:29,580 --> 01:08:31,240
- Success!
- Seriously?

1236
01:08:31,240 --> 01:08:32,890
[Suk Jin passes.]

1237
01:08:34,840 --> 01:08:36,780
[Still room for one more winner.]

1238
01:08:37,250 --> 01:08:38,790
I haven't seen anyone else go by.

1239
01:08:40,210 --> 01:08:41,810
[Too bad!]

1240
01:08:43,260 --> 01:08:46,150
I think Suk Jin is the only one
who's passed so far.

1241
01:08:46,150 --> 01:08:47,280
Really?

1242
01:08:47,860 --> 01:08:50,740
I'm going to make it this time,
and go back, okay?

1243
01:08:50,740 --> 01:08:52,880
[I'm going to be
the next person to make it in!]

1244
01:09:06,210 --> 01:09:07,900
[Strike!]

1245
01:09:09,080 --> 01:09:10,880
Give me my yogurt!

1246
01:09:11,850 --> 01:09:13,360
[Darn!]

1247
01:09:13,370 --> 01:09:14,890
Bye, Soo Hyun!

1248
01:09:14,890 --> 01:09:16,980
See you later!

1249
01:09:24,030 --> 01:09:26,650
[Red Team's Hyun Woo arrives.]

1250
01:09:28,130 --> 01:09:30,410
[Lee Hyun Woo- Pass.]

1251
01:09:31,050 --> 01:09:35,260
- Soo Hyun really is...
- Soo Hyun was the first to find one.

1252
01:09:35,260 --> 01:09:36,880
- Really?
- He was the first to find a bowling alley.

1253
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:38,420
He was the first one to arrive.

1254
01:09:38,670 --> 01:09:41,480
He told me that he was actually out
bowling with his friends last night.

1255
01:09:41,480 --> 01:09:44,120
He was out bowling?
He must play a little bit of everything.

1256
01:09:44,120 --> 01:09:47,370
- How many did Soo Hyun knock down?
- He knocked down nine.

1257
01:09:47,370 --> 01:09:49,040
- He knocked down nine?
- Really?

1258
01:09:53,090 --> 01:09:54,110
Fail!

1259
01:09:54,980 --> 01:09:56,040
Fail!

1260
01:09:56,580 --> 01:10:00,010
[Soo Hyun having unfortunately failed.]

1261
01:10:00,720 --> 01:10:03,710
- How do you run so fast?
- He really is a fast runner.

1262
01:10:04,210 --> 01:10:06,440
He may be a fast runner,
but he has no sense of direction.

1263
01:10:07,130 --> 01:10:08,300
Soo Hyun...

1264
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:11,200
For all the talent that you posses,
you have too big of a gap.

1265
01:10:12,350 --> 01:10:16,040
You've got the speed,
and are physically in good shape.

1266
01:10:16,040 --> 01:10:18,360
He's nothing but a good looking idiot.

1267
01:10:18,780 --> 01:10:20,400
Okay, your next mission.

1268
01:10:21,290 --> 01:10:23,900
- Catch a chicken and bring it back.
- What the heck is that?

1269
01:10:27,880 --> 01:10:29,580
[Catch me if you can!]

1270
01:10:30,110 --> 01:10:32,340
- Catch a chicken and bring it back.
- What the heck!

1271
01:10:33,230 --> 01:10:36,610
- How am I going to do that?
- You just grab it!

1272
01:10:36,610 --> 01:10:39,260
It's just an animal.
Go and catch it.

1273
01:10:39,640 --> 01:10:42,590
- Catching chickens is so easy!
- I've never done it before.

1274
01:10:44,950 --> 01:10:46,460
I'll tell you where they are.

1275
01:10:46,460 --> 01:10:49,580
If you follow the path where
you found the watermelon ladies

1276
01:10:49,580 --> 01:10:52,090
you'll find a little garden to the right.

1277
01:10:52,090 --> 01:10:54,730
If you go in there,
you'll find your chickens.

1278
01:10:55,350 --> 01:10:57,080
- Aren't they really fast?
- I've never even touched them before.

1279
01:10:57,080 --> 01:10:59,000
- I don't think I can do it.
- There's no way Dong Hoon can do it.

1280
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,180
- He won't be able to do it.
- He's really scared of chickens.

1281
01:11:01,640 --> 01:11:03,080
Okay, get ready.

1282
01:11:03,550 --> 01:11:05,860
- What do I do?
- I don't think I can run any more.

1283
01:11:05,870 --> 01:11:08,500
- First come first serve. Two people!
- Yes!

1284
01:11:11,470 --> 01:11:14,340
[Runs like the wind even after saying
that he couldn't run anymore.]

1285
01:11:20,340 --> 01:11:22,390
[Runner extraordinaire!
Run, Soo Hyun!]

1286
01:11:26,560 --> 01:11:28,460
What do I do?
I can't catch them.

1287
01:11:31,060 --> 01:11:33,350
[First to arrive at the farm
where the chickens are waiting.]

1288
01:11:46,180 --> 01:11:48,870
[Approaches the chickens while
breathing very heavily.]

1289
01:11:51,340 --> 01:11:53,250
[Who is that kid?]

1290
01:11:58,910 --> 01:12:00,640
[Ambush attack?]

1291
01:12:02,550 --> 01:12:06,450
[After saying that he's never done it before,
he works desperately to catch a chicken!]

1292
01:12:06,450 --> 01:12:08,360
How am I going to catch
these chickens?

1293
01:12:09,200 --> 01:12:11,130
[The chickens and the chase that has
Soo Hyun throwing his body around.]

1294
01:12:13,090 --> 01:12:14,760
- They're so quick!
- How am I going to catch one?

1295
01:12:15,570 --> 01:12:17,910
[Attacks again!]

1296
01:12:18,320 --> 01:12:20,540
[Two chicken in the corner!]

1297
01:12:20,540 --> 01:12:22,260
[Catches one of them!]

1298
01:12:23,800 --> 01:12:25,510
Just hang still.

1299
01:12:25,510 --> 01:12:28,060
[Runner Soo Hyun succeeds in
catching a chicken!]

1300
01:12:29,160 --> 01:12:31,810
[With a fierce determination
to catch a chicken...]

1301
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:38,510
- Gary! We have to stop him!
- No, Ji Hyo! You can't!

1302
01:12:38,510 --> 01:12:40,200
- Please!
- Gary!

1303
01:12:40,900 --> 01:12:42,540
- We can't let him go!
- Ji Hyo!

1304
01:12:42,930 --> 01:12:44,900
[Wrangles Ji Hyo away from
him to leave.]

1305
01:12:47,120 --> 01:12:49,120
[Run, Soo Hyun!]

1306
01:12:49,660 --> 01:12:52,150
- Soo Hyun will get it done this time.
- I'm sure he'll bring back a chicken.

1307
01:12:52,150 --> 01:12:54,950
Soo Hyun said earlier that
he's never done it before.

1308
01:12:54,950 --> 01:12:57,080
And they could scare him once
he sees them in real life.

1309
01:12:57,080 --> 01:12:59,040
The roosters especially...

1310
01:12:59,040 --> 01:13:01,470
[There is no fear.
All he knows is to just run!]

1311
01:13:02,160 --> 01:13:03,180
- Who is it?
- It's Soo Hyun.

1312
01:13:03,180 --> 01:13:04,630
Soo Hyun!

1313
01:13:06,020 --> 01:13:08,000
[Soo Hyun succeeds!]

1314
01:13:11,080 --> 01:13:14,750
- Why didn't they stop him?
- They should've stopped him.

1315
01:13:14,750 --> 01:13:17,080
- Why didn't they stop Soo Hyun?
- It's Soo Hyun that embraces the chicken.

1316
01:13:19,240 --> 01:13:23,170
[Soo Hyun That Embraces the Chicken.]

1317
01:13:23,890 --> 01:13:25,310
[Don't come close...]

1318
01:13:25,320 --> 01:13:27,350
[But don't go too far either?]

1319
01:13:33,060 --> 01:13:35,010
It's Soo Hyun that embraces the chicken.

1320
01:13:36,720 --> 01:13:38,160
I'm going to take it to my mom.

1321
01:13:40,060 --> 01:13:42,140
- Look at this one.
- I got one.

1322
01:13:42,150 --> 01:13:43,730
[Of the three remaining players,
Gary succeeds in catching one.]

1323
01:13:43,730 --> 01:13:45,420
- Come on, Ji Hyo!
- Okay.

1324
01:13:46,580 --> 01:13:48,990
[Only ones left remaining are
sole female, Ji Hyo and scaredy cat Ro-Ro.]

1325
01:13:48,990 --> 01:13:50,370
How are you going to do this?
I don't think I can do it.

1326
01:13:50,380 --> 01:13:51,940
I really can't do this.

1327
01:13:52,280 --> 01:13:55,180
I really don't think I can do it.
Do you think you can do it?

1328
01:13:56,250 --> 01:13:59,150
[But after thinking about it, his face
keeps popping into Ro-Ro's head...]

1329
01:13:59,150 --> 01:14:00,590
Rather than dying by
Jong Kook's hands...

1330
01:14:02,970 --> 01:14:04,870
How are you doing that?

1331
01:14:05,330 --> 01:14:08,120
- Seriously... how are you doing that!
- Here, grab it.

1332
01:14:08,120 --> 01:14:10,350
- Hurry up and take this one.
- How am I to grab that?

1333
01:14:10,350 --> 01:14:11,800
Hurry up and take it!

1334
01:14:12,470 --> 01:14:15,450
[Blank Ji is conceding to Ro-Ro?]

1335
01:14:15,450 --> 01:14:17,170
- You're giving it to me?
- Hurry up and go.

1336
01:14:17,170 --> 01:14:18,710
Why are you giving it to me?

1337
01:14:18,710 --> 01:14:21,530
Thank you so much, Ji Hyo.
I'll be good to you for the rest of my life.

1338
01:14:21,540 --> 01:14:23,040
Mommy!

1339
01:14:23,580 --> 01:14:25,840
Thank you so much, Ji Hyo!

1340
01:14:27,340 --> 01:14:30,240
[Thank you, Ji Hyo...]

1341
01:14:31,760 --> 01:14:33,650
Ji Hyo caught it for me.

1342
01:14:44,400 --> 01:14:45,500
Gary that embraces the chicken.

1343
01:14:45,500 --> 01:14:48,590
You've become the dog that stole
the chicken just like the proverb goes.

1344
01:14:48,590 --> 01:14:50,730
Is this the dog chicken?

1345
01:14:50,730 --> 01:14:52,740
- Ji Hyo caught it for me.
- Really?

1346
01:14:52,740 --> 01:14:54,950
- Are you that scared of it?
- You try holding it.

1347
01:14:54,950 --> 01:14:56,890
They're really scary.
I know they are.

1348
01:14:58,090 --> 01:15:00,030
[Even Blank Ji is heading back
to the group.]

1349
01:15:02,540 --> 01:15:05,490
- Why did you give the chicken to Ha Ha?
- Ha Ha can't even get near the chickens.

1350
01:15:05,720 --> 01:15:08,640
- He was so terrified of them.
- But why did you give it to another team?

1351
01:15:08,640 --> 01:15:10,710
- Gary made it in, so you should've came.
- Thanks, Ji Hyo.

1352
01:15:10,890 --> 01:15:14,010
So thus, the Blue Team
is our first place winner.

1353
01:15:14,020 --> 01:15:16,290
[Blue Team wins first place
for all the members making it in first.]

1354
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:18,820
- We have to pick again, right?
- Which one should we pick?

1355
01:15:18,820 --> 01:15:20,320
We don't have a three yet.

1356
01:15:22,270 --> 01:15:24,780
[First place winner, the Blue Team
chooses number three.]

1357
01:15:25,290 --> 01:15:27,270
<i>It's time to move on to
the final location.</i>

1358
01:15:27,270 --> 01:15:28,960
Okay, let's go.

1359
01:15:28,960 --> 01:15:32,170
<i>[Go to 'S' university in Shinsoodong
and find the Running Man landmark.]</i>

1360
01:15:32,170 --> 01:15:33,670
What is this?

1361
01:15:33,670 --> 01:15:36,580
[Blue Team's total number is 11.]

1362
01:15:37,250 --> 01:15:39,860
I wonder if we should've
picked five instead.

1363
01:15:39,860 --> 01:15:43,360
But we don't know if the higher number
is a good thing or a bad thing.

1364
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:48,250
If we have to do something like
jump roping at the university...

1365
01:15:48,250 --> 01:15:51,110
If we have to have ten people
join in on the jump roping...

1366
01:15:51,120 --> 01:15:52,680
That would be disadvantageous.

1367
01:15:52,680 --> 01:15:55,440
[In that case, the higher number
would be disadvantageous.]

1368
01:15:55,440 --> 01:15:58,220
[What kind of a mission awaits
them at the final location?]

1369
01:15:59,430 --> 01:16:02,650
[Green Team's total count is seven.]

1370
01:16:02,650 --> 01:16:04,380
Some kind of a chance?

1371
01:16:05,330 --> 01:16:10,190
[Total count for the Red Team is nine.]

1372
01:16:15,200 --> 01:16:17,970
['S' University in Shinsadong.]

1373
01:16:18,990 --> 01:16:21,110
Look at all the people gathered here.

1374
01:16:24,150 --> 01:16:29,120
[Countless number of students gathered
upon hearing the news of their arrival.]

1375
01:16:32,350 --> 01:16:33,620
What is this?

1376
01:16:35,510 --> 01:16:39,680
[Unbelievable number of students
gathered around the field as well!]

1377
01:16:40,690 --> 01:16:43,790
[Just what is their final mission?]

1378
01:16:53,320 --> 01:16:54,700
I wonder what we'll be doing?

1379
01:16:59,700 --> 01:17:00,740
What is that?

1380
01:17:00,740 --> 01:17:03,510
[Three teams are finally gathered
around the field.]

1381
01:17:05,010 --> 01:17:07,970
<i>The final mission for the
Flower Boy Athletic Competition.</i>

1382
01:17:09,370 --> 01:17:14,740
<i>There are over 300 students that
we have gathered around here.</i>

1383
01:17:14,750 --> 01:17:15,880
Really?

1384
01:17:17,200 --> 01:17:19,120
[A few hours prior]

1385
01:17:21,300 --> 01:17:26,920
[Have accepted a total of 300 students
for the final mission participation.]

1386
01:17:26,920 --> 01:17:28,940
We love you!

1387
01:17:29,790 --> 01:17:31,410
We love you, Gary!

1388
01:17:31,410 --> 01:17:33,280
All the people over there?

1389
01:17:36,740 --> 01:17:40,500
[Through the process,
300 students have been gathered.]

1390
01:17:45,040 --> 01:17:47,390
[Thanking them in advance.]

1391
01:17:48,580 --> 01:17:51,720
<i>You can take 100 students of
the 300 students that are gathered.</i>

1392
01:17:51,730 --> 01:17:55,440
- A hundred?
- A hundred?

1393
01:17:55,440 --> 01:17:57,140
Don't you think that's too large
of a scale?

1394
01:18:03,010 --> 01:18:05,420
Let's win this together!

1395
01:18:05,420 --> 01:18:06,680
[100 students per team.]

1396
01:18:06,690 --> 01:18:08,020
I'm so nervous!

1397
01:18:10,650 --> 01:18:16,380
[The students to run towards
the team they want to be on.]

1398
01:18:18,540 --> 01:18:22,970
[Come over here!]

1399
01:18:31,110 --> 01:18:35,860
[Once each of the teams have
gained their 100 participants.]

1400
01:18:37,130 --> 01:18:38,620
Thank you all for coming.

1401
01:18:39,150 --> 01:18:42,790
Song Ji Hyo!
Song Ji Hyo!

1402
01:18:42,790 --> 01:18:45,420
[Green Team is full of male participants
thanks to Blank Ji's allure?]

1403
01:18:45,420 --> 01:18:47,060
We're full of men!

1404
01:18:47,730 --> 01:18:49,730
We're already a family.

1405
01:18:51,900 --> 01:18:53,980
Don't listen to him.
He's lying.

1406
01:18:53,980 --> 01:18:55,310
Jong Kook is lying.

1407
01:18:55,310 --> 01:18:57,200
Once the game is over...

1408
01:18:58,690 --> 01:19:01,630
[And thus, 300 students became
divided into three separate teams.]

1409
01:19:02,060 --> 01:19:03,940
<i>There is one important rule.</i>

1410
01:19:03,940 --> 01:19:04,950
What is it?

1411
01:19:04,950 --> 01:19:07,830
- You've all received numbered cards, right?
- Yes.

1412
01:19:08,730 --> 01:19:11,570
<i>Blue Team is plus 11.</i>

1413
01:19:12,160 --> 01:19:16,140
<i>Green team is plus seven,
and Red Team is plus nine.</i>

1414
01:19:19,060 --> 01:19:20,230
What is that?

1415
01:19:23,200 --> 01:19:26,640
[Could that be...]

1416
01:19:26,640 --> 01:19:29,000
[The secret of the numbered cards?]

1417
01:19:31,010 --> 01:19:34,810
[The power guides makes their entrance!]

1418
01:19:36,890 --> 01:19:38,690
This is crazy.

1419
01:19:40,130 --> 01:19:42,290
They all look so strong.

1420
01:19:45,680 --> 01:19:48,940
[Power]

1421
01:19:49,390 --> 01:19:57,920
<i>The 27 men that are here will be added to
your teams depending on your numbers.</i>

1422
01:19:57,920 --> 01:19:59,480
Can we pick them ourselves?

1423
01:20:01,320 --> 01:20:03,820
Oh my!
Look at this right up front.

1424
01:20:03,820 --> 01:20:06,730
[Red Team can choose nine men.]

1425
01:20:09,150 --> 01:20:11,770
[Green Team chooses their seven.]

1426
01:20:12,630 --> 01:20:14,560
Anyone here like Song Ji Hyo?

1427
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:16,410
- Me!
- Pick me!

1428
01:20:20,640 --> 01:20:23,090
[Carefully inspecting their powerful thighs.]

1429
01:20:26,270 --> 01:20:28,090
Please save our team.

1430
01:20:28,090 --> 01:20:31,410
[Blue Team chooses their 11 members.]

1431
01:20:37,280 --> 01:20:39,770
<i>I will now reveal the final mission.</i>

1432
01:20:39,770 --> 01:20:42,770
[Time to reveal the final mission.]

1433
01:20:42,770 --> 01:20:45,060
<i>It's a three way tug of war.</i>

1434
01:20:45,060 --> 01:20:48,350
[Three way tug of war.]

1435
01:20:51,120 --> 01:20:52,940
- Nice!
- Hey!

1436
01:20:55,440 --> 01:20:56,900
We're all set.

1437
01:20:57,960 --> 01:21:00,400
[A never before seen scale of tug of war.]

1438
01:21:00,400 --> 01:21:03,990
[Blue Team- 114, Red Team- 112
and Green Team- 110 people!]

1439
01:21:03,990 --> 01:21:07,230
[Each team full of determination to win!]

1440
01:21:07,950 --> 01:21:09,460
What are you doing?

1441
01:21:13,400 --> 01:21:18,850
<i>Each team must now get
into their position.</i>

1442
01:21:18,850 --> 01:21:22,340
[Each team must get into their position.]

1443
01:21:29,790 --> 01:21:33,520
[A game on a unbelievable scale
made up of 330 people.]

[The final game of the
Flower Boy Athletic Competition is...]

1445
01:21:37,990 --> 01:21:41,230
[A giant three way tug of war.]

1446
01:21:41,360 --> 01:21:43,260
- Can I touch you?
- Sure, go ahead and touch me.

1447
01:21:44,640 --> 01:21:48,100
[Muscle Kkuk going around
spreading the energy.]

1448
01:21:52,420 --> 01:21:55,030
[An impromptu dance demonstration.]

1449
01:21:59,840 --> 01:22:03,730
You're going to have to pull
at a faster speed.

1450
01:22:04,450 --> 01:22:06,670
Let's all leave here with good lasting
memories even if we lose.

1451
01:22:06,670 --> 01:22:09,590
[Winning isn't what's important.
Let's make good memories together!]

1452
01:22:10,010 --> 01:22:11,900
You know what our battle cry is, right?

1453
01:22:11,900 --> 01:22:14,080
- Yes!
- Our battle cry is 'Ji Hyo'.

1454
01:22:14,720 --> 01:22:17,490
You pull on 'Hyo'.
Ji Hyo! Ji Hyo!

1455
01:22:17,490 --> 01:22:20,970
Ji Hyo!
Ji Hyo!

1456

- They sound like they're in the army.
- What do they expect us to do?

1457
01:22:27,060 --> 01:22:29,660
We'll be heaving at faster successions.

1458
01:22:29,670 --> 01:22:33,670
We'll do it in very quick successions.
Pull, pull, pull!

1459
01:22:33,670 --> 01:22:37,130
Let's do it in a very quick succession.
Let's just rip the rope out of their hands!

1460
01:22:37,130 --> 01:22:39,590
<i>Fighting!</i>

1461
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:44,560

for the Red Team is Ha Ha.]

Unbelievable power of the Green Team!]

1473
01:23:31,750 --> 01:23:33,190

01:23:36,700 --> 01:23:40,100
[The tail of the Blue Team not
seeming to budge at all.]

1475
01:23:41,550 --> 01:23:44,400
[Then perhaps the Green Team
is looking most likely to win?]

1476
01:23:47,330 --> 01:23:50,480
<i>Ji Hyo!
Ji Hyo!</i>

1477
01:23:56,060 --> 01:23:59,560
[The Red Team getting pulled closer
and closer to the middle.]

1478
01:24:03,760 --> 01:24:08,070
[Is the Blue Team starting to lose
their ground and getting pulled in too?]

1479
01:24:10,610 --> 01:24:12,940
[The Green Team is getting
closer to the bell!]

[Will the Green Team win?]

1481

1485
01:24:52,420 --> 01:24:54,640
It barely even moved.

1486
01:24:54,640 --> 01:24:56,390
It went much better than I expected.

1487
01:24:56,390 --> 01:24:58,190
You guys did a great job.

It's okay!
It's okay!

You fools!
Hey!
