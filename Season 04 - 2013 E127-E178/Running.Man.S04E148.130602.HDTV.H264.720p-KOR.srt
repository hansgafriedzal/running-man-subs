The pine nuts here must be...

I'm talking. Why are you talking about
pine nuts when I'm talking?

183
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,940
You don't listen to us when we talk.

184
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:41,900
- Do you not listen to other people?
- You should listen to the whole sentence.

185
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,670
You are the selective hearing type.

186
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:46,750
Once one person finishes talking the
other person starts to talk.

187
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:50,860

It was really horrible.

204

It wasn't horrible.

205
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,770
I was ugly. I was ugly but it wasn't
to the point that it was horrible.

206
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:35,660

It was like a dried pollack.

209

Dried pollack is a little too much.

- It tastes good, right?
- It looked really good.

230
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,110
It tastes good because it's
not too sweet.

00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:57,440
<i>Don't do this to me..</i>

351
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,600
<i>[They are finally holding the rackets.]</i>

352
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:05,030
Can't you give this to us after
we cross the line?

353
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:06,580
Really?

354
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:09,610
You should've given it to us after we crossed
the net. How are we supposed to cross now?

355
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:15,080
Next time when you make teams put only
one person like them per team. These two...

356
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:17,390
- I really can't handle..
- Be quiet.

357
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:19,710
<i>[Yoo Jae Suk is going through the
troubles of being the youngest one.]</i>

358
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:24,240
This is dirty.

359
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,740
Why did you make us come through
this way?

360
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:27,760
Come in quickly.

361
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:30,730
Your body is so big.

362
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:32,540
<i>It's high.</i>

363
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:34,490
At least we are not bungy jumping.

364
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:36,230
<i>- We just need to make the first 5 points?
- 5 points.</i>

365
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:38,380
<i>Stop pushing me to this side.</i>

366
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:39,480
<i>[Badminton 55 meters above. Start!]</i>

367
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,680
You can rest for this one.
I'll do it.

368
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,460
- No. Stay still.
- Stay still.

369
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:44,920
I'm the president of the
celebrity's badminton club.

370
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,080
You're not even that good at it.

371
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,120
Do it quickly.

372
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,960
I told you to stay still. Stay still.

373
00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:55,440
What are you doing?

374
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:00,270
- Really?
- Stay still.

375
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:03,470
- Stay still.
- It's because we both moved.

376
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:04,960
You are bad at this, right?

377
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,490
- I'm good at it.
- Just stay still.

378
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:08,110
- You stay still.
- Let go.

379
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:09,690
- Let go of this! Let go of this!
- Take your hand out! Out!

380
00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:11,570
- Yes, like this.
- Do it like this.

381
00:17:11,570 --> 00:17:13,860
Don't use any force. Just stay like this.

382
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:17,420
Just leave your hand on top of mine.

383
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:19,770
- Just leave your hand on top.
- You are bad at this!

384
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:21,430
You are bad at this!

385
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:23,900
I'm the president of the
celebrity badminton club.

386
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,970
What are you doing?

387
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:28,510
I told you not to use any force.

388
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:29,630
Don't do anything.

389
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:30,960
<i>Can't I play alone?</i>

390
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:34,430
He's really bad at badminton.

391
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:36,150
- Don't play. Just stay still.
- Stay still.

392
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:38,270
- Stay still. Let me have the racket.
- Why?

393
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:39,870
You keep giving him points.

394
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:41,050
<i>Give it to me.</i>

395
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:44,600
Stay still.

396
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,800
Stay still. Let go of the racket.

397
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,700
Let go of it.

398
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:51,290
- Let go.
- Let go.

399
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:52,710
I told you to let go.

400
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:54,230
Stop it.

401
00:17:55,730 --> 00:17:58,260
I'm the president of
the celebrity badminton club.

402
00:17:58,260 --> 00:17:59,570
Don't touch me.

403
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:01,470
- Let go!
- Don't touch me. Let go of it.

404
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:03,920
- Let go.
- Let go of this.

405
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:06,020
- Let go!
- Let go!

406
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:07,560
Why are you doing this?

407
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,200
Just leave your hand on top of mine.

408
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,190
Stop it.

409
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:13,330
They are telling me to leave my
hand on top of everything.

410
00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:15,190
<i>Just leave your hand on top.
Just leave your hand.</i>

411
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:16,290
Don't put your strength into it.

412
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:18,520
That's right. You're doing well.

413
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,540
<i>Return Chance?</i>

414
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:24,800
I told you to let go of it.

415
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:27,030
That was mine.
Why were you trying to hit it?

416
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:28,900
It was mine.

417
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,340
It was coming in my direction.
It was mine.

418
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:31,970
You weren't ready for it.

419
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:33,480
I was like this.

420
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,010
I went in for it in the right position.

421
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:36,980
Why are you drooling so much?

422
00:18:38,530 --> 00:18:40,410
Hey. That's right. Let go.

423
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,120
Really?

424
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,100
- I told you to stay still.
- He did it.

425
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:48,980
- I won, right?
- Yes.

426
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:52,250
<i>You can challenge me again if you go
up and down three times while shouting:</i>

427
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:53,880
<i>"If we work together, we live!"</i>

428
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:54,980
- We can do it again?
- That's right.

429
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:58,760
You two decide who's going to
be in the middle.

430
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,200
I can't do it anymore.

431
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,530
We have to say,
"If we work together, we live!"

432
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:03,420
"If we work together, we live!"

433
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:05,180
The three of us have to do it together.

434
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:06,440
Together. Ready? Start.

435
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:08,090
Start.

436
00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:11,770
If we work together, we live.

437
00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:13,080
Why are we doing the wave?

438
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,230
<i>[Disharmony]</i>

439
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:15,690
Wait.

440
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:17,460
Judge. Judge.
Come here for a moment.

441
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:18,810
Come here for a moment, Judge.

442
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:21,740
Please put me into another group.
I think I'm going crazy.

443
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:23,790
I can't do it anymore with them.

444
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:25,750
Forget about the team.
Please let me go down as quickly as possible.

445
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:27,100
This is the problem right now.

446
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:29,250
- Start. If we get together..
- We did it already.

447
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:31,280
We already did it three times.

448
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,310
We did it already.

449
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:34,690
Listen to the judge.
You come to the middle.

450
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:36,650
Why am I in the middle?

451
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:40,120
I'm a lefty so I can't use my hand if we do it like this.

452
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,650
We don't want you to use it.

453
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:43,340
I'll be in the middle so you go here.

454
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:47,170
I'm going to really...

455
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:48,590
You go.

456
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:50,690
This is so frustrating.

457
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:52,930
I'm a lefty.

458
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:55,030
I'm a righty.

459
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:56,910
He doesn't have to do it.

460
00:19:56,910 --> 00:20:00,240
We'll just do it like this.

461
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,040
We'll play like this.

462
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:04,140
This is so frustrating.

463
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:06,370
I'm the president of the badminton club.

464
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:08,210
Why are you like this?

465
00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:10,820
You only go out twice a year.
What do you mean president?

466
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:12,970
Just put your hand in.
Why are you taking that out?

467
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:15,060
- Why are you holding onto it so tightly?
- Just put your hand on top of mine.

468

<i>[When can they go down...]</i>

00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,110

<i>[Blue team's turn at R3.]</i>

471
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:22,830
<i>We have to position ourselves well.
You don't have to hurry..</i>

472
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:26,130
- There is no need to hurry, Dong Hoon.
- You have to take your positions.

473
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:27,680
<i>There is no need to hurry, Dong Hoon.</i>

474
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:32,960
<i>[Before the balloon pops because there
are too many people in the car...]</i>

<i>Don't do this to me.</i>

00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:51,290
Don't do this to me!

481
00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:52,950
Look at Gary.

482
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,500
Don't do this to me.

483
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,490
Why are you doing this?
Don't do this to me.

484

<i>Ji Hyo.</i>

485
00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:01,720
<i>- Ji Hyo!
- Think of it as alcohol and just drink it.</i>

486
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,380
It is the alcohol that you like.

487
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:04,070
<i>Think of it as alcohol.</i>

488
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:05,890
<i>- Please.
- Please think of it as alcohol.</i>

489
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:07,460
This place is a club.

490
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:09,500
They are both really ugly.

491
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,170
Ji Hyo. Sorry. I can't hold on.

492
00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:15,510
<i>I have no more strength in my arms.</i>

493
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:18,480
Don't finish it!

<i>Fail... Gary's balloon popped.</i>

495
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:21,970
<i>What is this?</i>

496
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:23,650
<i>Acorn jelly! Acorn jelly!</i>

497
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:24,610

This is not a joke.

Dong Hoon! Doesn't he look like the
actors from "Surprise"?

502
00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:36,790
The foreigner.

503
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:39,450
Oh My God! Surprise!

504
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:41,750
You look like the actors from "Surprise."

505
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:43,400
Truth or false?

00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,720
<i>[Truth or false?]</i>

- I'm going crazy.

509
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,670
They are too strong.

510
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:57,340
I'll eat.

511
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:58,350

- I will..
- I will eat it.

00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:11,710
- Fine. You can eat it.
- You can try first.

00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,550
Listen to what we have to say!
Don't just focus on the food!

524
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:27,750
<i>We are having a hard time.</i>

525
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:29,870
Look at our balloon!

526
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:32,750
<i>This is the balloon. It's too big.</i>

527
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:34,040
It is.

528
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:36,970
<i>[An answer with no soul...]</i>

529
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:39,580
- She really doesn't care.
- Should we do it?

530
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:40,810
<i>You have five seconds.</i>

531
00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:43,000
Let's get in first.

532
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,490
<i>[Eating already?]</i>

533
00:22:44,490 --> 00:22:47,450
Can she eat already?
Is she allowed to eat already?

534
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:48,970
<i>She's cheating.</i>

535
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:51,250
She's a cheater.

536
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:53,420
Even before it started she..

537
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:57,800
<i>I understand that you want
to eat it but, eat it after we start.</i>

538
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,070
She's so greedy.

539
00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:01,160
Are you playing the game or are
you just hungry?

540
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,450
I only ate a little bit.

541
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:04,300
You ate this much, Yi Hyun.

542
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:05,650
<i>- Are you ready?
- Yes.</i>

543
00:23:08,810 --> 00:23:11,430
<i>Those guys are really scary.</i>

544
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:13,900
This is really.

545
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:16,470
<i>Lock the door.</i>

546
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:19,070
Acorn jelly! Acorn jelly!

547
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:20,830
Press really hard.

548
00:23:23,650 --> 00:23:25,750
<i>[Eating acorn jelly... Start!]</i>

549
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:28,870
<i>Acorn jelly! Acorn jelly!</i>

550
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:29,970
<i>[Strong pressure]</i>

551
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:32,760
<i>More. Press harder!</i>

552
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,040
<i>They are really ugly.</i>

553
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,530
<i>Distorted tiger.</i>

554
00:23:35,530 --> 00:23:36,820
<i>He's really ugly.</i>

555
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:38,900
<i>Acorn jelly! Acorn jelly!</i>

556
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:40,150
<i>Eat it quickly!</i>

557
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:41,170
<i>Hurry!</i>

558
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:42,860
<i>They are withstanding this!</i>

559
00:23:45,610 --> 00:23:47,530
<i>Jong Kook is really not a human.</i>

560
00:23:47,530 --> 00:23:49,510
<i>His face is turning red!</i>

561
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:50,960
<i>They're withstanding this?</i>

562
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:53,840
Relaxed?

563
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,440
Don't appreciate the taste!

564
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,850
<i>Eat it quickly!</i>

565
00:23:56,850 --> 00:23:59,100
<i>Yi Hyun, you'll get indigestion if
you eat quickly.</i>

566
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:00,530
<i>Hurry!</i>

567
00:24:00,530 --> 00:24:04,340
<i>Yi Hyun, where do you live?
Yi Hyun, what's your dream?</i>

568
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:05,990
<i>Oh no!</i>

569
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:07,400
<i>Give her some water.</i>

570
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,470
Yi Hyun!

571
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:10,640
What are you doing? Push!

572
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:13,040
This is the end!

573
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:15,190
Push!

574
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:17,020
Push more!

575
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:18,390
<i>She's almost done.</i>

576
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:20,130
<i>Stop it!</i>

577
00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:22,140
- I'm done.
- No you're not.

578
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:24,430
<i>-No!
-You guys can do this!</i>

579
00:24:24,910 --> 00:24:26,310
<i>Really?</i>

580
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:27,580
<i>It popped!</i>

581
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:31,630
<i>Oh no! It popped...</i>

582
00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:34,020
<i>- Kwang Soo.
- Hey!</i>

583
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:35,060
Yes?

584
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:36,770
We just started.

585
00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:38,300
<i>Yellow team. Fail.</i>

586
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:40,720
<i>And there's a handle. You should've
used it to your advantage.</i>

587
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,440
<i>You should've put it underneath it and...</i>

588
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,510
That's right.

589
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:45,690
<i>You should've put it in and...</i>

590
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:48,950
This team has no such thing as teamwork.

591
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:50,790
- They keep fighting.
- It's zero.

592
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:53,300
<i>They have no teamwork.</i>

593
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:54,710
<i>- Ready?
- Yes.</i>

594
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:57,410
<i>I'll eat quickly.</i>

595
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:00,730
You don't live alone in this world.

596
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:07,560
Acorn jelly!

597
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:12,780
<i>Acorn jelly! Acorn jelly!</i>

598
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:24,420
Acorn jelly! Acorn jelly!

599
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:27,190
<i>[You're doing well!]</i>

600
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:30,100
<i>Acorn jelly! Acorn jelly!</i>

601
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:32,550
Everyone! Let's try a little harder!

602
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:35,080
Push harder!

603
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:38,700
<i>What should I do?</i>

604
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:39,880
<i>My head. My neck.</i>

605
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:42,410
Hey you!

606
00:25:43,870 --> 00:25:44,660
<i>It popped! I swear..</i>

607
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:47,160
I swear that

608
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:49,040
I saw him pop it with his hands.

609
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,750
You did it with your hands, right?

610
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:52,330
<i>I saw it.</i>

611
00:25:53,170 --> 00:25:55,100
<i>[It's been a long time since we
have seen Bad Ji Hyo!]</i>

612
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:56,730
<i>I was withstanding it.</i>

613
00:25:56,730 --> 00:25:59,080
<i>They lost their success due to
uninvited guest, Giraffe.</i>

614
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:01,610
<i>Kwang Soo, I'll forgive you for
what you did before.</i>

615
00:26:02,190 --> 00:26:04,440
Come here.

616
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:06,120
<i>This time you really have to do it.</i>

617
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,440
- Fighting!
- Fighting!

618
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,880
- Say it seriously!
- Look at us when you say it!

619
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,680
- Look at our faces.
- Fighting!

620
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:12,820
- Fighting!
- Fighting!

621
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:14,900
<i>This time the balloon got smaller.</i>

622
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:16,140
<i>This time it's for real.</i>

623
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:21,900
<i>[Open it and...]</i>

624
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:23,090
<i>[Acorn jelly army gets in together.]</i>

625
00:26:23,090 --> 00:26:25,140
<i>Acorn jelly! Acorn jelly!</i>

626
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:27,370
<i>Acorn jelly!</i>

627
00:26:27,370 --> 00:26:29,490
<i>Acorn jelly! Acorn jelly!</i>

628
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:37,560
Jong Kook's balloon has extra space.

629
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:39,030
You can put in one more.

630
00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:40,850
<i>[Inhumane strength]</i>

631
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:41,880
- Hurry!
- No!

632
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,280
Wait a minute!

633
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:45,650
<i>I think we can succeed this time!</i>

634
00:26:45,650 --> 00:26:47,260
<i>It's time we succeeded!</i>

635
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:51,720
<i>It's time to succeed!</i>

636
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:52,880
What are you doing?

637
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,480
<i>What's going on?</i>

638
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,260
<i>Hurry!</i>

639
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:58,160
<i>- So Yi Hyun, what are you doing?
- Hurry up and eat!</i>

640
00:26:59,330 --> 00:27:01,100
<i>- She's almost done.
- Wow, Jong Kook..</i>

641
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:03,150
<i>- Hurry!
- Please...</i>

642
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,700
<i>No...</i>

643
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:17,410
Wait.

644
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:19,320
<i>Haroro's interference strategy starts.</i>

645
00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:23,990
Wait a minute. You can't do this.

646
00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:25,480
How can you do this?

647
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,830
Wait.

648
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:27,890
<i>Bad Ji Hyo helps.</i>

649
00:27:27,890 --> 00:27:30,340
Wait.

650
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:31,580
My nose!

651
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:32,930
Wait. Wait!

652
00:27:32,930 --> 00:27:35,700
- Don't take pictures! Don't take pictures!
- Nice to meet you! Nice to meet you!

653
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:37,240
Don't take pictures!

654
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,890
<i>You need to preserve moments
like these.</i>

655
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:42,390
Don't take pictures!

656
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:44,230
Thank you.

657
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:46,130
Please!

658
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:50,460
How can he look like this?

659
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:54,800
Zoom in!

00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:58,590
<i>How can he look like this?</i>

662
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:01,730
Please! I can't hold on any longer.

663
00:28:02,770 --> 00:28:04,010
<i>[Yi Hyun is finishing up!]</i>

664
00:28:04,010 --> 00:28:06,020
<i>So Yi Hyun has a really
good appetite.</i>

665
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:07,600
<i>Let's just wait a little longer.</i>

666
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:08,740
<i>A little longer.</i>

667
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:10,860
<i>No! No!</i>

668
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:12,960
Push! Push!

669
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,040
Really?

670
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:16,000
<i>Since she finished,
she just needs to whistle.</i>

671
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,790
<i>No! No!</i>

672
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:20,050
I don't know how to whistle.

673
00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:22,760
<i>You have to blow it.</i>

674
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:28,950
She doesn't know how to whistle.

675
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:30,970
- That's good.
- Wait.

676
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,070
<i>It didn't come out.</i>

677
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:35,410
<i>She doesn't know how to whistle.</i>

678
00:28:37,810 --> 00:28:38,630
Finished, finished!

679
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:40,390
Finished, finished! I did it.

680
00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:42,050
<i>[Whistle, success!]</i>

681
00:28:42,050 --> 00:28:44,660
<i>[Yellow team, success!]</i>

<i>[A mess.]</i>

683
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:49,370
They can't be happy even after succeeding.

684
00:28:49,730 --> 00:28:52,440
<i>[I'm full.]</i>

685
00:28:52,510 --> 00:28:54,900
Yi Hyun, you should tell us
that we did well.

686
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,330
Yi Hyun?

687
00:28:56,330 --> 00:28:57,970
Don't say that you're full.

688
00:28:57,970 --> 00:29:00,000
We succeeded together.

689
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,560
- Do you not see us?
- Hello?

690
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:04,070
- Yi Hyun, we are a mess right now.
- Do you know how hard we tried?

691
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:06,570
- We are a mess.
- Don't just say how full you are.

692
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:08,870
I know you did well but...

693
00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:10,880
Say stuff like, "You look so tired.
What should we do?"

694
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:14,770
<i>This is you.</i>

695
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:19,530
<i>Yellow team can roll the dice first.</i>

696
00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:21,410
<i>I can't walk.</i>

697
00:29:21,410 --> 00:29:22,620
<i>[She's ready to roll dice alone?]</i>

698
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:24,050
Should I roll it?

699
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:29,060
- This team, really..
- We have to do it together.

700
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:31,930
I heard that he exercised a lot.

701
00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:36,380
Thank you, Gary.

703
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:39,670
You did well. Thank you.

704
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,680
No. It's okay.

<i>- You come out.

709
00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:16,290
<i>- What are you doing?
- Just come out.</i>

710
00:30:16,290 --> 00:30:18,520
- We have to win first.
- Wait. Let me do this first.

711
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:19,890
Let me do this first.

712
00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:23,110
That's your right hand.
Try it with that hand.

713
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:24,830
Put your right hand in.

714
00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:26,860
- Like this?
- Yes. Like that.

715
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:28,720
- It's perfect now.
- This works.

716
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,400
- Do it like this?
- Yes.

717
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,690
- This is good.
- Why didn't we think of this earlier?

718
00:30:32,690 --> 00:30:34,220
<i>It works like that too...</i>

719
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:38,100
- It works.
- The fool taught him this.

00:30:39,810 --> 00:30:41,100

- That's right.
- That's right.

726
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,730
Did you see?

727
00:30:53,390 --> 00:30:55,700
- Don't put any strength into your arms.
- I didn't. I'm not doing anything.

728
00:31:00,410 --> 00:31:04,030
<i>It's shaking.</i>

729

We just need one more point to succeed.

733
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:11,750
Match point.

750
00:31:52,250 --> 00:31:54,040
Are you done eating already?

751
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:56,140
<i>I think we have to give him
another bowl.</i>

<i>It looks really good.</i>

754
00:31:58,410 --> 00:32:00,080
He really finished.

755
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:02,280
<i>Already done.</i>

756
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:03,330
Let's go.

757
00:32:03,330 --> 00:32:04,650
He finished?

758
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:06,830
Why do you eat so quickly?

759
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:08,820
He went out in an eating contest
and came in third place.

760
00:32:18,050 --> 00:32:19,480
It's delicious.

761

<i>[Gather all your senses and survive.]</i>

767
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:45,740

<i>Do you understand how
tired we are now?</i>

770
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:58,140
I was eating so I couldn't really see
what was going on.

771
00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:02,280
After we finished you didn't
even show excitement.

772
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,490
Usually when two people
had a hard time...

773
00:33:04,490 --> 00:33:06,490
- I understand you had a hard time too but..
- Usually..

774
00:33:06,490 --> 00:33:10,520
they come and go like this and
ask if we're all right.

775
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:14,540
They say something to the opponent
about being too harsh and..

776
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:16,070
Even at this very moment she's
doing something else.

777
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:17,740
She's touching her fingernails and..

778
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:20,220
Why did you put such shiny things
on your nails?

779
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:23,190
Because I heard I was coming
out on television.

780
00:33:23,190 --> 00:33:24,970
That's why I had my nails done.

781
00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:26,560
<i>It's a street market.</i>

782
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:28,700

<i>[They said to gather all our

784

- Fighting!
- Fighting!

787
00:33:36,430 --> 00:33:37,830
Fighting!

788
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:42,300
<i>[Full of generosity, agriculture
and marine products.]</i>

789
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:45,620
It smells good here.

790
00:33:47,030 --> 00:33:49,730
-There are a lot of places here.
-Thank you.

791
00:33:49,730 --> 00:33:53,250
<i>[Figure out the food that touches your ear.

792
00:33:53,250 --> 00:33:55,250
They said to figure out the food
that touches your ear.

793
00:33:55,250 --> 00:34:00,250
<i>With only the touch of your ear...
figure out what it is</i>

795
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:04,120
<i>Only let your left ear out
of that hole.</i>

796
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:06,010
This is driving me crazy.

797
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:09,560
- Like this? Like this.
- Only let the left ear out.

798
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:11,790
<i>And please stand in a single line.</i>

799
00:34:11,790 --> 00:34:13,430
Take you ear out like this.

800
00:34:13,430 --> 00:34:15,570
Your ear.

801
00:34:15,570 --> 00:34:17,780
Kim Jong Kook nags too much.

802
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:21,210
What's wrong with you?

803
00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:22,760
<i>Excuse me.</i>

804
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,050
<i>What's wrong with you?</i>

805
00:34:24,050 --> 00:34:27,670
- We are doing such weird things.
- We really are.

806
00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:29,640
<i>The first object.</i>

807
00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:35,280
It's kind of scary.

808

<i>- Let's start with Kwang Soo.
- Wait.</i>

809
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:39,780
<i>Kwang Soo it can be something weird.</i>

810
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:41,040
Wait. Wait!

811
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:44,050
- Why? Why?
- Kwang Soo, it can be something weird.

812
00:34:44,050 --> 00:34:47,050
Give me a sign after saying 1, 2, 3.

813
00:34:47,050 --> 00:34:49,040
What is this? I heard a sound!

814
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,630
What is this? It made a sound!

815
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:53,440
<i>[It's definitely not something normal.]
[This is?]</i>

816

<i>[It's a sea cucumber.]</i>

817
00:34:56,530 --> 00:34:57,770
What is it? It made a sound.

818
00:34:57,770 --> 00:34:59,400
It's probably not something normal.

819
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,520
It's not a normal object.

820
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:05,140
<i>Why?</i>

821
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:07,120
<i>Yi Hyun's in big trouble.</i>

822
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:13,560
Stop!

823
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:15,880
Why?

824
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:18,690
What is this?

825
00:35:18,690 --> 00:35:20,100

Tell me.

828
00:35:23,850 --> 00:35:25,730
You have to tell us before you do it.

829
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:28,880
<i>It's Kim Jong Kook's turn now.</i>

830
00:35:30,770 --> 00:35:32,450
Wait! Wait.

831
00:35:32,450 --> 00:35:34,100
<i>Wait! Wait.</i>

832
00:35:34,370 --> 00:35:36,200
Why?

833
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:40,530
The person who is doing it gave me a signal
but then it made a really weird sound.

834
00:35:40,530 --> 00:35:43,390
- I heard something.
- Listen to that sound very well.

835
00:35:43,390 --> 00:35:46,360
- Kwang Soo, it made a sound.
- Don't miss the sound.

836
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:48,710
- This is really scary.
- We have to finish this at once.

837
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:50,110
Look at your muscles.

838
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:51,420
Wait. I'm ready.

839
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:53,310
Don't avoid it.

840
00:35:53,310 --> 00:35:54,420
<i>-Again.
-Again.</i>

841
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:57,230
It's making a sound.
What is this?

842
00:35:57,230 --> 00:35:58,920
<i>What is this?</i>

843
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,460
<i>You can do this.</i>

844
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:01,540
What on earth is this?

845
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:03,500
What is this?

846
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:04,750
It felt like a tongue.

847
00:36:04,750 --> 00:36:07,330
I heard this kind of sound.

848
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:10,700
We'll go now.

849
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:11,860
<i>What are you doing?</i>

850
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:14,720
Oh my God.

851
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:17,270
<i>Oh my God.</i>

852
00:36:17,370 --> 00:36:19,050
<i>- You have to endure it.
- What is this?</i>

853
00:36:19,050 --> 00:36:21,050
<i>- What are you doing to the ear?
- It's nothing much.</i>

854
00:36:21,050 --> 00:36:22,160
Miss So.

855
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:24,500
Am I done?

856
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:25,660
What is this?

857
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:30,560
Stay still.

858
00:36:33,010 --> 00:36:35,080
[Her ear...?]

859
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:37,220
What are you doing Jong Kook?

860
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:39,170
- We saw everything.
- Are you starting a love line?

861
00:36:39,170 --> 00:36:40,970
- That's not it.
- Are you starting a love line?

862
00:36:40,970 --> 00:36:42,600
<i>What are you doing?</i>

863
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,300
- That's not it.
- She can take it off on her own.

864
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:46,480
- She can take it off on her own.
- Why are you doing it?

865
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:47,480
That's not it.

866
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:48,590
Let's go.

867
00:36:48,590 --> 00:36:50,280
They have to buy it and
come back.

868
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:52,060
<i>The yellow team heads for
the market first!</i>

869
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:53,270
I think it's rice cake.

870
00:36:53,270 --> 00:36:54,520
It was black.

871
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:56,020
That's not it. It was green.

872
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:57,140
Poop.

873
00:36:59,970 --> 00:37:02,410
It stinks.

874
00:37:02,410 --> 00:37:03,810
It always happens to you.

875
00:37:03,810 --> 00:37:05,320
You are really unlucky.

876
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,440
I'm right, right?

877
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:08,480
- He's really unlucky.

Isn't it this?

<i>[It's deodeok that's good for your body.]</i>

882

- Stop overreacting.
- Why are you overreacting?

883
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:27,500
- Wait. Wait a moment.
- It's too scary.

884
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:29,220
Why are you making such a big fuss?

885
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:31,030
- Wait a minute.
- We are going to start now.

886

<i> What's wrong with you?</i>

887
00:37:35,570 --> 00:37:36,700
<i>What's wrong with you?</i>

888

<i>Really?</i>

890

Didn't it feel like dried calamari?

904
00:38:06,610 --> 00:38:07,730
I'm not sure.

905
00:38:07,730 --> 00:38:09,070
Dried calamari?

906
00:38:09,070 --> 00:38:10,220
- To me..
- It was hard.

907
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:12,910
- To me it felt like...
- What?

908
00:38:12,910 --> 00:38:14,090
It was hard.

909
00:38:14,090 --> 00:38:15,960
Wasn't it hard?

910
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:18,100
- The head of a pig.
- The head of a pig?

911
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:20,430
It wasn't that soft.

912
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:22,370

915
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,620
Look at the cutlass fish.

916
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:30,470
Hello.

917
00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:33,860
<i>It's really thick but it's only 10,000 won.</i>

919
00:38:35,070 --> 00:38:36,390
<i>It's crabs.</i>

920
00:38:36,390 --> 00:38:37,610
It's a conch, my favorite.

921
00:38:37,610 --> 00:38:39,210
<i>- It looks really good.
- Look at the shrimp.</i>

922
00:38:39,210 --> 00:38:40,770
<i>- The shrimp is as big as my arm.
- Hello.</i>

923
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,720
- This is good too.
- This is really good.

924
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:47,880
Isn't it this, fried kelp?

925
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:51,170
- It felt like mugwort rice cake.
- Pounded rice cake.

926
00:38:51,170 --> 00:38:52,880
If it's mugwort rice cake, it's awesome.

927
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:55,170
<i>I saw the other team but
they didn't get surprised.</i>

928
00:38:55,170 --> 00:38:56,580
It's here.

929
00:38:57,990 --> 00:39:01,430
Because there is powder on it and there was
water on our ears it might have felt like that.

930
00:39:01,430 --> 00:39:03,900
Boss, can I try one of these?

931
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:06,510
It's all wrapped but you want to try it?

932
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:07,580
- We have to buy it.
- Hello.

933
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:09,050
Can I have one bite?

934
00:39:09,050 --> 00:39:10,360
It's 2000 won.

935
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:13,360
Thank you.

936
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,700
Should we put it on our ears?

937
00:39:15,690 --> 00:39:16,840
It's similar!

938
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:17,930
Put it on his ears.

939
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:20,630
- It's similar.
- It's similar, right?

940
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:21,680
It's similar.

941
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:23,340
- But it doesn't get on the ears.
- It doesn't but..

942
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:24,910
<i>Let's try this first.</i>

943
00:39:24,910 --> 00:39:26,400
The pupae look good.

944

<i>Can I get some pupae?</i>

945
00:39:28,990 --> 00:39:31,740
- Eat it if you want.
- It could be pupae.

946
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:34,030
- It's not pupae.
- Just eat it.

947
00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:36,650
It could be pupae.
How much is it for one cup?

948
00:39:36,650 --> 00:39:39,220
Should we buy dried calamari?

949
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:41,190
I thinks it's dried calamari.

950
00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:42,290
Don't you think that it can be garlic?

951
00:39:42,290 --> 00:39:44,220
What are you eating?

952
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:45,190
You're eating rice cake.

953
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:46,200
It's because I was hungry.

954
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:47,630
You bought rice cakes?

955
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:49,570
You shouldn't eat it like that.

956
00:39:49,570 --> 00:39:50,710
Watch me.

957
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:56,930
Pupae.

958
00:39:56,930 --> 00:39:58,660
Stop eating.

959
00:39:58,660 --> 00:40:01,750
The pupae is mine.

960
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,040
My pupae.

961
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:05,120
<i>I can't hear you.</i>

962

- Try it.
- Feel this.

It wasn't this.

Yes.

Let's try this.

985
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:03,520

It could be this.

986
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:05,300
Fish?
It could be this.

987
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:09,290
It could have been it's tail.

Yes.

1054
00:44:01,630 --> 00:44:03,940
- We got it right away.
- At once?

- We got it.
- Here.

- I told you that it was this.
- You said it wasn't.

1064
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:25,270
Why didn't you do it then?

1065

- This...
- Everyone.

1067
00:44:27,730 --> 00:44:29,950
First of all, it doesn't smell.

1068
00:44:29,950 --> 00:44:31,790
Would they do something
that smells?

1069
00:44:31,790 --> 00:44:33,580
I told you it was that.

1070
00:44:33,580 --> 00:44:35,420
It was this.

1071
00:44:35,420 --> 00:44:39,710
This smells. If it was this you would've
smelled it right away.

1072
00:44:39,710 --> 00:44:41,310
I said it kind of felt like dried calamari.

1073
00:44:41,310 --> 00:44:42,640
This is dried calamari?

1074

This guy here is
a bit drunk...

1087
00:45:05,710 --> 00:45:07,880
He's pretty dim-witted, too.

1088
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:09,340
I'm sorry.

1089
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:11,790
- I'm sorry.
- Why are you doing this, seriously?

1090

If you're going to be on
this show, do things right!

- Stop it!
- Why are you being like this?

You want to get hit again?

1093

Why are you nibbling on that rice cake?

1094

Calm down!
Don't lose your temper.

1095
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:23,660
He's a bit slow and lacking.

1096

Please let him go.
Goodbye, sir! And thank you.

1097

1098

Stop, that's enough.

Your ear is really sensitive.

against something again?

It smelled fishy.

00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:47,000
It might be seafood.

I have to put on a suit and go home.
