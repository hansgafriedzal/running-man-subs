[Variety show's rookie, Jung Woo Sung-
He shows us how it's done?]

4
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:08,490
[Early vacation that they're
learning to enjoy with their whole bodies.]

5
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:13,280
[Will Jung Woo Sung become a fixture in
variety land only after two shows?]

6
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,170
[We are the rulers of variety land!]

7
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:16,340
[And...]

8
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:18,300
[The eternal captain... Park Ji Sung!]

9
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:19,820
[I love you, SBS?]

10
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:21,240
How about a video message?

11
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,290
[Tough video message.]

12
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:25,700
- Where did you guys meet?
- Is she a good cook?

13
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:27,840
What was it about her
that made you fall for her?

14
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:29,880
[And...]

15
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,150
Do you have any interest in coming back?

16
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:32,410

00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:38,580
[One bright summer morning-
At a busy gas station.]

19
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:42,660
[Yoo Hyuk dressed in blue floral shirt.]

20
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:44,980
Hello.

21
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:49,200
- What's going on today?
- Please wait for the other members.

22
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:54,400
Ah... seriously. Why is he
wearing sunglasses on a cloudy day?

23
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,400
Come on, seriously.

24
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:58,620
- What are you doing?
- What?

25
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:01,310
- Why are you walking like that?
- Because I'm in a good mood.

26
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:04,390
- Why are you in a good mood?
- Isn't it nice to be outdoors again?

27
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:06,540
How nice is it to be working out here?

28
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:09,950
Why do you have your shirt
opened up like that?

29
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,650
- Don't you know what this look is?
- What is it?

30
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:13,690
This is like what he looked like
in 'City of the Rising Sun'.

31
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:17,050
This is what Jung Woo Sung dressed like
in the movie, 'City of the Rising Sun.'

32
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:22,960
[Is he making a comparison?
This is the original look...]

33
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:26,050
- As you can see from your clothes...
- We're on opposing teams.

34
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:27,640
I like being on different teams.

35
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:30,050
Your teams will be divided up depending on
the color of the shirt that they're wearing.

36
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:32,600
- Really?
- I wonder who'll be on my team.

37
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:36,890
[Mr. Gary in a blue floral shirt.]

38
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:39,610
- Gary!
- I think he's on your team.

39
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:42,470
Hello.

40
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,710
- It's Kwang Soo. Ugh...
- Ugh...

41
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:51,750
[And 2PM's Junho rejoining the gang
after his appearance last week.]

42
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:58,570
[New hope for the
otherwise dismal Red Team.]

43
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:00,020
Junho, why are you dressed in red?

44
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:02,730
[Excited Haroro arrives for the fun getaway.]

45
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:04,180
- The teams are divided up already?
- Hi, Ha Ha.

46
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:06,920
- Come here. Come join us.
- I'm stuck with the nagger?

47
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:08,100
- Come here.
- Is this it?

48
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:10,940
Both the teams are led by naggers.
Our situation is no better than yours.

49
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:12,750
I bet that the teams are
divided up like this on purpose.

50
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:15,340
- Why?
- Think of Woo Sung on your team.

51
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:18,130
It would be just as funny no matter
who's team he's on.

52
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:20,470
- You'd look so funny standing next to him.
- That goes without saying.

53
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:22,340
I don't envy you guys.

54
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:25,720
You guys look like Junho's entourage.
The entertainment firm's president

55
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:28,890
with his manager,
and you as the coordinator.

56
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:31,000
- That's hilarious.
- You're the coordinator.

57
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,930
[A rare sight of a muscle bound coordinator.]

58
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:34,730
- I see someone else coming.
- Where? Oh, it's Song Ji Hyo.

59
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:37,060
[Blank Ji dressed in a blue floral shirt.]

60
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:38,930
Good morning!

61
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:41,470
- Why are you angry, Ji Hyo? You look angry.
- I feel like it's my wife coming home.

62
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:46,180
It puts me in a bad mood when Kwang Soo
greets me so happily first thing in the morning.

63
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:48,680
- It puts you in a bad mood?
- What's that supposed to mean?

64
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,560
Why would I put you in a bad mood?

65
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,900
Stop greeting me so happily
in the morning from now on.

66
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,080
- It puts me in a bad mood.
- That's so funny.

67
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,960
- What the heck?
- Don't greet her happily anymore.

68
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,700
From now on, don't greet me
so happily in the mornings.

69
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:03,160
- Don't say hi to her.
- Just don't even greet me anymore.

70
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:05,330
I haven't greeted you.

71
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:07,290
I didn't want to put you in a bad mood.

72
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:09,070
- Hyo Joo's here. Hyo Joo's here!
- Where?

73
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:12,040
Hi, Hyo Joo!

74
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,930
- Hello!
- Hi, Hyo Joo!

75
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:16,280
- You're on our team!
- You're as lively as ever.

76
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,130
- Don't act so lively in the mornings.
- Hi, Hyo Joo.

77
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:21,710
Seeing you so lively puts us in a bad mood.

78
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,410
- You look so pretty.
- Don't even greet us.

79
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:28,330
[And...]

80
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:31,750
[The floral shirt legend,
Jung Woo Sung makes his appearance.]

81
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:35,070
I don't think I've ever seen
Woo Sung in a hat before.

82
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:37,330
- Hello.
- Hello, Woo Sung!

83
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:38,570
Hello.

84
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:41,500
It's 'City of the Rising Sun'!
'City of the Rising Sun'!

85
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:43,900
Wow, we get to see it in person.

86
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:46,680
I'm going to look so ugly
standing next to him.

87
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:49,010
- Wow, that's too hilarious.
- Doesn't this look so funny?

88
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:51,100
So this is our team?
Woo Sung's on our team?

89
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:53,680
See? Real stars don't wear sunglasses.

90
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,620
But you're always wearing your sunglasses.

91
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:58,330
- I was just about to take off my sunglasses.
- They think they're too cool for the cameras.

92
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:02,430
Take a good look.
The real stars don't wear sunglasses.

93
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:04,130
Look at how the real stars don't
even wear their sunglasses.

94
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:05,910
<i>You will be divided up into
these two teams today.</i>

95
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:09,230
<i>Today's race is, Early Vacation Race.</i>

96
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:13,010
[Today's race-
Early Vacation Race.]

97
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:16,510
- What is this?
- Is it Dong Wan?

98
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:18,860
- How long have you been back there for?
- When did you get here?

99
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:22,590
<i>What you see in front of you right now
are your prizes for the day.</i>

100
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:26,530
[From a TV to a tent,
12 generous different vacation giveaways.]

101
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:29,500
<i>What you see behind you
is the giveaway number board.</i>

102
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:32,430
<i>As you probably know already,
you can't just take those with you.</i>

103
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:35,140
<i>The two teams will be combating each other
in a series of different games.</i>

104
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:36,880
<i>And at the end of each game</i>

105
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:41,320
<i>the team that won the game will get to choose
two numbers from the numbers board.</i>

106
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:44,380
<i>The winning team gets to pick their first two
and then the loser team picks their two.</i>

107
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:49,280
<i>So the team that chooses the prize behind
the number chosen wins that prize for now.</i>

108
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,530
<i>And at the end of the very
final competition</i>

109
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:54,510
<i>the winning team of that final competition
gets to win all of the prizes.</i>

110
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:02,580
You look cool just standing there
and listening to the explanation of the rules.

111
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:03,930
[Even cool about how he
listens to the explanation.]

112
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,680
I thought he was shooting a
beer commercial.

113
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,610
I'm going to follow and copy him
with everything that he does today.

114
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:11,440
Yeah, it's funnier if you copy him.
That would be funnier.

115
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,600
That really is a comic show.

116
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,880
[A definite world of difference.]

117
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:18,370
- Why aren't you talking, Hyo Joo?
- What's wrong?

118
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:19,770
Was yesterday too tough on you?

119
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:21,780
Are you upset?
You look like you're upset.

120
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:25,520
No, not at all.
I'm going to try to be more gentle today.

121
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,840
What a joke. You think
that suits you on Running Man?

122
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:30,300
- What are you talking about?
- Why is she trying to be more gentle?

123
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:33,600
[She's not falling for it!
An automatic reflex by now.]

124
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,810
- She's so strong with it now.
- She's comfortable with it now.

125
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:36,900
She's more forceful with it.

126
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:38,830
[Ah... I was trying to be more gentle today.]

127
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:41,490
Let's all get going.

128
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:43,190
- Let's go.
- Yes, let's go!

129
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:47,400
[Early Vacation Race- Starts now!]

130
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:52,410
- Everyone needs to put on their seatbelts.
- Okay.

131
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:54,510
<i>[Early Vacation Race]</i>

132
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,750
<i>[Go to Jeondongri and
find the Running Man landmark.]</i>

133
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:59,510
- Okay, Jeongdongri?
- Yes.

134
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:01,920
- We're on our way.
- This is so nice!

135
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:04,110
[Everyone on their way with excitement
to their first vacation of the summer!]

136
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:05,960
- Wow!
- Jeongdongri? Not Jungdongji, right?

137
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,760
You two are friends, right?

138
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:12,020
Since Jae Suk is friends with Jung Jae,
and you're friends with Jung Jae

139
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:13,120
does mean that the two of you
are friends?

140
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,770
- No, it doesn't really work that way.
- The reason being...

141
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:18,130
He was born in '72, and I was born in '73.

142
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:21,800
- Really?
- So us being friends would complicate things.

143
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:26,670
I don't think befriending a friend of a friend
and mixing it up like that is a good idea.

144
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:31,030
- You think so?
- Then Jae Suk would be your 'older brother'?

145
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:32,380
Of course.

146
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:36,010
Jung Jae and I are friends because
we were in the army together.

147
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:40,870
But Woo Sung and Jung Jae still use
honorifics towards one another, don't you?

148
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:42,050
- Yeah.
- To each other?

149
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:43,060
- Really?
- Yes.

150
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:45,300
- Even after being friends all these years.
- Why?

151
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:47,050
That's what we're comfortable with.

152
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:49,680
That's how we show respect to
each other as fellow actors.

153
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,810
- Really?
- Yes.

154
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:51,920
That's so cool.

155
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,900
- Mr. Ha Ha!
- Yes, Mr. Gary?

156
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:57,590
- Hope you have a wonderful day today.
- Thank you, Sir.

157
00:06:58,140 --> 00:06:59,980
- Let's have a meal together sometime.
- Yes, of course.

158
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:04,680
Even though we're not really stiff about it,
we do like to use honorifics.

159
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,530
- What are we going to be doing today?
- I had no idea you guys did that.

160
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:08,780
- Wow...
- They're like a happily married couple.

161
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:12,560
I think with how they treat each other,
they probably never fight.

162
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,760
- Yes, you're right. We've never fought.
- I bet you're right.

163
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:17,840
- To be so polite to your friend like that...
- I had no idea.

164
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:22,340
Since it makes us reconsider our actions
to one another before doing them

165
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:24,700
we find that we don't really
do anything offensive to one another.

166
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:27,000
- So we've never fought.
- Wow, that's amazing.

167
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,650
No casual speech to actresses either?

168
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:32,500
I don't really lower
my speech with them at first.

169
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,160
But once some time passes,
and we get to know each other better...

170
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:37,100
There was a time when the director yelled
cut during the filming of 'Love Story'

171
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:40,970
and when I asked if she was okay,
using honorifics then felt rather greasy.

172
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:42,520
- That didn't feel right.
- You're right.

173
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:46,120
It's actually better to be
more casual in times like that.

174
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,410
You okay?

175
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:50,160
[Mr. Gary showing us how it's done.]

176
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,440
- What about Ji Hyo?
- Ask Ji Hyo if she's okay.

177
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,150
Ji Hyo, are you okay?

178
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:57,050
So that's how it's done!

179
00:07:57,050 --> 00:07:59,150
Nice... that was pretty good.

180
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:02,230
- He said it differently than you.
- But she's different.

181
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:04,130
- Why?
- As soon as I saw her yesterday...

182
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:06,400
I ran in on her and eliminated her
without even saying anything to her.

183
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,690
- He was the Grim Reaper yesterday.
- I thought your eyes were shooting out fire.

184
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:10,400
They were shooting out flames of fire.

185
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:13,410
[Last week...]

186
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:17,200
[Jung Woo Sung, who turned a variety show
into a scene out of an action movie.]

187
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:20,520
[But today, he's being
transformed into a comedian?]

188
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:24,150
- Don't you know that this is a variety show?
- Watch and learn.

189
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:26,710
[A promising variety newbie.]

190
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,190
[Running Man Vacation Plans.]

191
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:34,610
[Farming field snack game.]

192
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:36,050
There... there it is.

193
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:39,210
[Arriving at the first
Early Vacation Race location.]

194
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:43,120
Wait, this is like the last time
when Hyo Joo was here...

195
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:47,410
You can each choose one that you like
and change into it.

196
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:49,590
Woo Sung, you have to choose
one for yourself.

197
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:51,300
- Seriously?
- You can choose first.

198
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:57,010
- I think I'm going to go with this one.
- You sure that's not too fashionable for you?

199
00:08:57,010 --> 00:08:59,840
I think I'll go with this grey one.

200
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:02,900
Kwang Soo loves the animal prints.

201
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:05,140
You're right.
Kwang Soo does like the animal prints.

202
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:09,060
But I can't forsake
my preference for him either.

203
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:10,960
Yes, you're right.
You go with the one you want.

204
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,140
But those pants on you...

205
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:16,120
- What the heck?
- It's taking on a European feel.

206
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,920
That's not how they're supposed to look.

207
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:21,690
[Even the work pants
takes on a fashionable look.]

208
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:26,650
[The man who turned a farming field
into an instant runway.]

209
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,550
Should I change my pants to match
the rest of my team?

210
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:32,920
Yes, change into this one.

211
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:37,760
- Okay, I'll do it for the team.
- See? You're supposed to look like Gary.

212
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,080
[The correct way the work-pants
are supposed to look.]

213
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:41,990
They're supposed to look like the way
they look on Gary right now.

214
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:44,340
[His body was made to wear the work-pants.]

215
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:47,850
[So that's what it is...
The body made for a variety show...]

216
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:51,310
- Then should we switch our pants?
- Want to try switching?

217
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,350
Yes, try switching with him.
It could be the pants.

218
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:55,730
- Yes, it could be the pants.
- I want to look like Gary.

219
00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:58,940
These pants are very special to me,
but I will still give them to you.

220
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:03,120
- I think you're getting there.
- That's not it either.

221
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,140
[What?
But those are the same pants!]

222
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:09,090
How did those pants all of a sudden
turn into shorts?

223
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:11,090
They look like nice shorts on him.

224
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:14,490
[They look like three quarter length
work-pants on him.]

225
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,460
They should be pulled over
your bellybutton.

226
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:20,110
But even those pants look the way they're
supposed to look on Gary.

227
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:23,660
[No matter what bachelor Gae wears...]

228
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:25,350
It's the perfect length on him.

229
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:26,980
[The perfect fit all the way from
his bellybutton right down to his ankles.]

230
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:29,580
- That's the way they're supposed to fit.
- That's the correct fit.

231
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:34,310
There's nothing we can do about it.
Kwang Soo... yours is right here.

232
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:35,560
Thank you, Jae Suk!

233
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,670
- It's the giraffe print.
- Not the giraffe print, but a leopard print.

234
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,740
[Zebra or a leopard print...]

235
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:41,900
- Do you remember this, Hyo Joo?
- Yes. I'm all too familiar with this.

236
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:43,470
[All too familiar work-pants to Hyo Joo.]

237
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:45,510
- You get to wear the pants again.
- This is a familiar sight.

238
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:49,030
- They look like a stage costume on Junho.
- They look good on Junho too.

239
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:51,890
[They look like a stage costume for Junho!]

240
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:54,160
- They look the best on Gary.
- Isn't it perfect on Gary?

241
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,890
You look like you were born
to wear those pants.

242
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:58,690
I actually gave my original
pair of pants to Woo Sung.

243
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:00,400
I really wanted his pants.

244
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,620
<i>Okay, everyone.</i>

245
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,900
<i>The name of the first game of the
Early Vacation Race is...</i>

246
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:07,600
<i>Watermelon loyalty game.</i>

247
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,020
[Watermelon loyalty eating game.]

248
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:11,650
<i>Watermelon is supposed to be the
specialty in this region.</i>

249
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:14,540
<i>They're supposed to be very delicious.</i>

250
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:17,930
- Does anyone know what the loyalty game is?
- Isn't it like a relay?

251
00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:20,200
The last person left has to eat
the remainder of the watermelon?

252
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,720
<i>The members of the team will run around
the course in a relay</i>

253
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:25,810
<i>and have to eat a whole watermelon
in order to finish the relay.</i>

254
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27,240
- The whole watermelon?
- Yes, the whole thing.

255
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,920
This really is a watermelon eating contest.

256
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:31,940
The game will be played best out of three.

257
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,570
[One whole watermelon has been cut up
in several pieces of various different sizes.]

258
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:37,290
- You go first, and he'll be the second.
- I think that would be best.

259
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:41,020
You'll be first, he'll be second, you third,
I'll be the fourth and Hyo Joo the last.

260
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:44,620
But it's possible that all the watermelon
will be gone with the second person.

261
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:47,340
- Really? You think he'll do that?
- Yes, I'm serious.

262
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:52,180
No matter how you guys decide,
you'll have to go by what Jong Kook says.

263
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:54,910
Why don't you just tell us what to do?
Tell us what the order is going to be.

264
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:57,050
- Why even bother discussing it?
- No kidding.

265
00:11:57,710 --> 00:11:59,620
- Suk Jin...
- Just do whatever you want then.

266
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:01,970
We're all just standing around here
waiting for him to make the decision.

267
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:05,340
- What are you talking about?
- You have two guests on your team.

268
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:06,830
What are you doing?

269
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:10,090
[With the two guests on the team,
all are waiting for Captain Kkuk to decide.]

270
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:12,680
Why don't we all gather around
and say a cheer?

271
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,510
- Fighting.
- Whatever.

272
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:15,630
[Forcing them into a cheer.]

273
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:18,260
- Come on.
- How many times do we have to cheer?

274
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:19,980
[His bulldozer-like leadership skills
are starting to surface.]

275
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:22,250
Do you want so trade places with me
so you can see what it's like, Woo Sung?

276
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:23,450
- No, that's okay.
- Seriously.

277
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:25,380
Why are you forcing us into this?

278
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:27,110
[All the teammates full of displeasure.]

279
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:29,310
- Jong Kook is starting to use his hands.
- Come on, let's go.

280
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:32,430
[Watermelon loyalty eating contest-
Round One.]

281
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:34,430
You want the small piece or
the big piece?

282
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,320
[First runners up- Jong Kook of the Red Team
and Woo Sung of the Blue Team.]

283
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:47,390
Nice, Woo Sung!

284
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:49,930
[The two alpha males giving a proper
watermelon eating show.]

285
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,520
That's unbelievable.

286
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,590
- Jong Kook's really fast too.
- Come on, Warrior!

287
00:12:58,590 --> 00:12:59,820
Warrior?

288
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,720
Jong Kook, did you hear?
She's calling for her warrior!

289
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:05,460
- Show me what you're capable of!
- What a joke!

290
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:07,580
Do you want a leg flip?

291
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:10,150
Look at Woo Sung go!

292
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:13,600

[The two men scarfing it down
without any hesitation.]

294
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:24,210
Jong Kook, eat three more!

295
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:26,890
You can pass it off to the next, Woo Sung.
Pass it off to the next!

296
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:28,510
- Great job!
- There you go!

297
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:31,230
[Woo Sung heads off to 'R2'.]

298
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:34,520
- Nice. Come on, Ha Ha.
- Pass it over to me.

299

[Captain Kkuk also stands to pass them off
after eating four huge pieces.]

300

Wow, I'm so full.

303

Squish it down with your teeth and
get all the juices out!

304

a Spartan would.]

- He's Waluigi.

- Are you okay?

- How many are there left?
- More!

324
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:41,590
Suck it down.
There you go. More!

325
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,760
There you go.

326
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,950
[Wow... he finished almost all of it!]

327
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:50,570
[And one more to cleanse his palate.]

328
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:52,340
Chew while you run!

329
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:53,790
- Run!
- Here he comes!

330
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:55,600
[Finally running off to pass it on.]

331
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,640
- They're almost gone?
- It's all over now!

332
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,230
I can't believe he ate it all!

333
00:14:58,570 --> 00:14:59,830
That's amazing.

334
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:02,950
What the heck!

335
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:07,440
- Here.
- Shove more in your mouth.

336
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:13,900
[Red Team heads off to final 'R5' in ease.]

337
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,380
Hand it to Hyo Joo.

338
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,830
[Taking her time to finish
one tiny piece of the watermelon.]

339
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:23,420
What the heck is this?

340
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:27,140
Kwang Soo looks like he's
about to get sick.

341
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:29,890
- You did great.
- I told you Kwang Soo would finish it.

342
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:33,130
[Red Team Wins!]

343
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:34,530
Great job.

344
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:36,540
We won. Great job.
That wasn't so bad, was it?

345
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:41,680
- Are you okay?
- Look at what you've done to this kid.

346
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:44,660
This just made me realize
what I'm capable of.

347
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:47,010
I told you that he can do it.

348
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:49,350
That's too bad.
We could've won that round.

349
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:52,350
Why don't I start this time?

350
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:53,910
Okay, you can go first.

351
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:57,510
- Then Woo Sung...
- You should go last.

352
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,720
[Entrusting the crucial
'R5' role to Woo Sung?]

353
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,200
- I'll trust in you then.
- Yes, please take care of it.

354
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:05,420
- Are you guys still not ready yet?
- We're ready.

355
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:08,450
- We are ready.
- If you are, then let's hurry up and do this.

356
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:12,190
- Can't you speak in nicer tones?
- That's what I'd like to say to you.

357
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:15,410
- That's what I'd like to say to you!
- The way you said it was rude!

358
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:18,270
Why are you spitting
all over our watermelon?

359
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:19,490
Seriously...

360
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:22,580
- Your pants are on backwards.
- So what? They're my pants.

361
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:25,540
- These are my pants.
- Your pockets are on the back.

362
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:28,260
- These are my pants.
- Can't you speak nicer?

363
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:30,550
- Why would I need to do that? These are mine.
- Can't you speak in a nicer tone?

364
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:33,730
My pants are fine.
This is a fashion statement.

365
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:35,530
- Okay, let's go!
- Yes, let's go.

366
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:37,930
Everyone to their positions.

367
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:39,360
- You're the fourth.
- Okay.

368
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:42,580
- This is...
- The first person has to eat a lot.

369
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:44,040
- Okay!
- Okay, I can do that.

- Jae Suk
- Yes?

372
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:50,380
- Eat three more pieces than Kwang Soo.
- Don't you worry!

373
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:52,500
- I'll eat five more than him!
- That's my boy!

374
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:55,080
Kwang Soo, don't think of it as eating.

375
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:57,220
You have to squish it down with your
mouth and drink it.

376
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:59,910
How can you drink a watermelon?

377
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:01,920
He can't stop with the instructions.
Seriously.

378
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:04,710
[Round two-
Ro-Ro vs. Hyo Joo.]

379
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:07,180
Hyo Joo, if you're too full to eat anymore,
pass it off to the next person.

380
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:12,280
- Fighting!
- There they go.

381

- Fighting!
- There they go.

382
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:18,640
- Be careful not to trip and fall.
- Ha Ha! You have to eat a lot!

383
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:21,090
Ha Ha!

384
00:17:21,090 --> 00:17:23,120
Eat as much as you can, Hyo Joo!

- You have to eat as fast as you can!
- Just eat!

Don't laugh!
There's no time for laughing!

390

Be quiet!

391
00:17:46,810 --> 00:17:48,660
Why is she always just yelling at me?

392
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:51,640
- Don't provoke her, Kwang Soo.
- I didn't even say anything to her.

393
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,930
You have to eat as much as you can, Ha Ha.

394
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:56,250
Why don't you just...

395

[Filled to the brim.]

396
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:01,910
- Okay, that's fine.
- Come pass it off. Come on!

397

You have to eat more!
Don't stop!

398
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:06,700
You can't stop right now.
Keep up the pace!

399
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:08,470
Don't do that to yourself, Dong Hoon!
Just pass it off!

400
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:11,280
- Why is this thing so heavy?
- I couldn't eat anymore.

401
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:13,460
Take your time.
Take your time running.

402
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:17,140
Take your time running, Ha Ha.

403

['R2'- Blank Ji vs. Big-nosed Brother.]

404

About 48?

406
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:30,670
Eat some bigger pieces, Suk Jin!

407

he can find.

[Nibbling away at the smallest pieces.]

409
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:36,720
He's choosing the smallest pieces and
leaving the larger ones for others.

410
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,020
What are you doing?

411

Ji Hyo is doing really great.

[Giant bites vs. Tiny bites.]

416
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:59,240
Suk Jin ate about 15 pieces
that are this size.

417
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,450
- What?
- What is he doing!

418
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:03,590
- That's all he's doing.
- Why aren't you eating bigger pieces?

419

from doing field work to have a snack.

home tonight.

489
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,360
[As if grinding down with a mixer.]

490
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:10,600
Look at him grinding that down!
Grind that down!

491

[Guinness World Book of Records?

493

Nice!
Great job, Jung Woo Sung!

494
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:25,840
He's already done with it!
Wow, he's done!

495
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,900
Just think of it as
eating a hamburger.

496
00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:32,710
[That's just absurd.]

497
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,520
Come on, eat!

498
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,050
You said you can do it.

499
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,800
You said grind it down like a mixer
and drink it up!

500
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,140
So do it like you said.

501
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:43,200
Let's see how well you
can grind it down.

502
00:22:43,610 --> 00:22:45,200
Come on, grind it down!

503
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,790
That's hilarious!

504

[Eating with some ease...]

505
00:22:50,990 --> 00:22:52,160
We're done, we're done.

506
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,560
Wow, Jung Woo Sung is
such a good eater!

507
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:57,210
- He's no joke.
- He's like a food fighter.

508
00:22:57,210 --> 00:22:59,840
He really is a food fighter.
Jung Woo Sung, the food fighter.

509
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,170
Why is he being so serious about it?

510
00:23:02,170 --> 00:23:04,510
This is a variety show.
Why are you being so serious about it?

511
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:07,640
I'm a variety rookie.
I've got a definite feel for it now.

512
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:13,170
Did you see his expression?
He looked like he did in his movie, 'Beat'!

513
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:16,510
- That's what he's always like.
- We won!

514
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,640
Okay!

515
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:20,730
- Okay.
- Let's go.

[Blue Team having finished their pile.]

517
00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:30,240

[You're dead!]

519
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:35,190

their great teamwork skills.]

Do you even want to win?

523
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:49,040
- You only ate one before you passed it off.
- Sorry, I'm sorry.

524
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:51,060
I guess I expected too much
from Jong Kook.

525
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,550
What the heck did you just say?

526
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:57,880
- This is the last round.
- The last round.

527
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:00,400
- This is the deciding round.
- How much do we have to eat now?

528
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,850
This is all you have.

529
00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:03,840
[Final round only consists of five pieces.]

530
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,130
One person can't eat all of them, right?

531
00:24:06,130 --> 00:24:08,130
Everyone has to eat one.

532
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:11,040
- You can't have any left in the mouth either.
- How about whistle blowing?

533
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:12,240
<i>That's up to you guys.</i>

534
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,610
The reason being,
did you see how Kwang Soo ate his?

535
00:24:14,610 --> 00:24:17,820
He went off to the next person with
his mouth still full of watermelon.

536
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:19,590
When did I do that?

537
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:22,070
You really like to exaggerate things.

538
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:24,610
Just like how a squirrel stuffs his mouth
full of acorn nuts?

539
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:27,640
He's basically saying that he's angry.

540
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,760
- What's wrong with him?
- Why are you so competitive?

541
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,930
I'm not being competitive,
but games should be played fair and square.

[Rookie's opinion on game playing-

- Woo Sung is a real chatterbox.
- Yes, I see that.

544
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:39,530
He really likes to talk.

[Woo Sung finally opening up and
talking out on the field?]

546

I have good hearing, a small heart,
and I chatter nonstop.

547
00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:48,230
- That's what I'm saying.
- So you're similar to me.

548
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:50,220
No, you and I are not similar.

clear line on what is and what isn't.]

- What are we going to be doing?

655
00:30:12,970 --> 00:30:15,380
I really am getting a nervous feeling.

656
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:17,440
Why are there helmets?
What are these for?

657
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:23,340
<i>This is the Blob Jump, which was the costliest
to set up in all 152 episodes we've done.</i>

658
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:25,600
[Welcome to Blob Jump]

659
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:28,060
- Blob Jumps are synonymous with vacations.
- What did you say?

660
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:31,940
<i>This is a water sport that is enjoyed
by people all around the world.</i>

661
00:30:31,950 --> 00:30:35,900
[Currently hot trending world sport.]

662
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:40,980
[Blob Jump having started over in Europe
makes its way over to Running Man!]

663
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:44,680
[Early Vacation Race's second course-
Blob Jump Competition.]

664
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:46,420
<i>This is a record competition.</i>

665
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:49,420
<i>The team that scores the
highest jump wins.</i>

666
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:51,830
[Three members per team will jump,
and the team with the highest record wins!]

667
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:55,960
<i>The specialists behind you will first
demonstrate how it's done.</i>

668
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,080
[Blob Jump's demonstration to start.]

669
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:00,210
The specialists will get a high record.

670
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:02,710
- And you guys will do what you're shown.
- We're actually going to do this?

671
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:05,290
[Step One- One person to place themselves
in front of the tube.]

672
00:31:05,290 --> 00:31:07,450
So the guy jumping right now doesn't
determine the score?

673
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:09,390
[Oh!]

674
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:19,560
- Are you sure that he's a specialist?
- Does he know what he's doing?

675
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:21,270
- What's he doing?
- What was that?

676
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:25,100
- You don't have to be cool about it.
- That was about two flips in the air.

677
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:27,150
- Are you sure he's not an entertainer?
- You did that on purpose, right?

678
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:30,160
He almost fell down to the water.

679
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:32,820
Are you sure he's not a specialist
on Running Man?

680
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:36,670
So once the other person falls,
I'm sure it makes the first one fly.

681
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:40,440
[Step Two- The other three people
then jump onto the back of the tube.]

682
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:43,680
Okay, take a close look.
These are specialists of the sport.

683
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:45,830
They're going to show you their jump.
Everyone take a close look.

684
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:48,230
One, two, three!

685
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:05,240
[Flies high into the air and dives into
the water after midair acrobatic moves.]

686
00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:09,560
Wow, awesome!
You really are a specialist!

687
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:11,450
[Mistake that he made a minute ago
has all been forgiven!]

688
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:15,330
- I didn't know he'd fly so high into the air!
- What the heck is that?

689
00:32:15,330 --> 00:32:17,250
How can a person fly so high
into the air like that?

690
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:20,580
- It needs to be a lighter person up front.
- Hyo Joo, you do it. You're perfect for it.

691
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,400
- That's no joke.
- How is that any different from bungee?

692
00:32:25,050 --> 00:32:26,940
Just fall on your butt.

693
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:29,940
You just need to bend your back
while looking out into the distance.

694
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:32,400
Because you'll be shot
straight into the air like that.

695
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,410
Thank you so much.
That was very cool.

696
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,720
- That was really cool.
- That was awesome!

697
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:38,730
[That looks like fun.]

698
00:32:38,730 --> 00:32:40,880
Jong Kook, why don't you
show us how it's done?

699
00:32:40,890 --> 00:32:44,720
Since you've been telling us how good you are,
show us how it's done.

700
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:47,090
There's no real reason for me
to do all that.

701
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:49,510
- I was just explaining things to you.
- Since you explained it all to us...

702
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:51,770
Why don't you show us in action
how you're really supposed to do it.

703
00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:52,800
And the three of us will jump.

704
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:55,390
- Which one of us will do it?
- It can't be a heavy person.

705
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,960
[Important for the three people jumping
on the back to be in sync.]

706
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,410
We have to land on our butt.

707
00:32:59,410 --> 00:33:02,980
- I think we need to lift up one of our legs.
- Yes, that's right.

708
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:04,740
We need to land on our back as
we lift up one of our legs.

709
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:08,680
And we have to focus on that red point
as our target when we jump.

710
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:11,900
Just think of it as lying on your back
as you jump off the platform.

711
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:14,140
- This isn't your team.
- Just think of landing on your back.

712
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:15,880
You just go home and lay down.

713
00:33:16,130 --> 00:33:18,840
If you lift just one leg,
your body may tilt too much to the side.

714
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:21,460
So as you lift up your leg,
you have to tilt your body backwards.

715
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:24,060
Are you a bully of this reservoir?
What's wrong with you?

716
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:28,530
- Why are you coming to bother us?
- No, I'm not doing that.

717
00:33:28,530 --> 00:33:29,870
Seriously.

718
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:33,530
[Playing Paper-Rock-Scissors to decide
which team will be the one to go first.]

719
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:36,190
Paper-Rock-Scissors!

720
00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:37,610
[Win - Lose]

721
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:41,330
Don't make me do
Paper-Rock-Scissors.

722
00:33:42,130 --> 00:33:45,010
- Can you do it with someone else?
- Paper-Rock-Scissors. I won.

723
00:33:45,010 --> 00:33:46,930
- I just won again.
- Thanks.

724
00:33:46,930 --> 00:33:48,990
Paper-Rock-Scissors.
Paper-Rock-Scissors.

725
00:33:48,990 --> 00:33:50,530
[Wins again!]

726
00:33:50,530 --> 00:33:52,280
- Let's try it again.
- Paper-Rock-Scissors.

727
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,670
Come on, isn't that enough?
How many do I have to win?

728
00:33:54,670 --> 00:33:57,010
- You're going to win again.
- Paper-Rock-Scissors. Paper-Rock-Scissors.

729
00:33:57,010 --> 00:33:58,160
I'm going to say it.

730
00:33:58,790 --> 00:34:00,870
- I'm going to say it. Paper-Rock-Scissors.
- Fine, do it.

731
00:34:00,870 --> 00:34:03,210
Paper-Rock-Scissors.
Paper-Rock-Scissors.

732
00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:04,310
Paper-Rock-Scissors.

733
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:06,990
[All- Kill!
Suk Jin wins five in a row!]

734
00:34:06,990 --> 00:34:09,800
[Big-nosed Brother truly is
a Paper-Rock-Scissors genius?]

735
00:34:09,810 --> 00:34:12,640
- How did that happen?
- It's because I was standing next to you.

736
00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:14,670
- Is that why I did so well?
- Of course.

737
00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:16,550
- Seriously...
- See? I'm a winning charm.

738
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:19,460
Turning my Paper-Rock-Scissors winnings...
Hurry up and get up there.

739
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:21,440
Okay, Blue Team first.

740
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:23,960
- Me.
- You're going to jump?

741
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:28,380
[First jumper for the Blue Team-
Jung Woo Sung.]

742
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:33,870
[He'll be the first to challenge
the Blob Jump in Running Man history!]

743
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:44,100
[That's... high...]

744
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:48,730
Remember how even the specialist
rolled backwards earlier?

745
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:51,360
- He almost rolled off that thing.
- He was rolling off of it.

746
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:52,990
It's not an easy thing to do.

747
00:34:53,470 --> 00:34:54,840
- Fighting!
- Okay.

748
00:34:55,330 --> 00:34:57,670
The Blue Team's... first human bullet.

749
00:34:57,670 --> 00:34:59,870
Just call me the human rifle.

750
00:34:59,870 --> 00:35:00,890
Okay, I'm going to jump.

751
00:35:00,930 --> 00:35:03,740
- He's so full of gusto.
- Gusto!

752
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:05,940
- Don't try to be too cool about it.
- Woo Sung!

753
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:10,570
[Cooley shaking the hands of
his comrades in a greeting.]

754
00:35:10,570 --> 00:35:12,990
- Is it really high up there?
- No, it's nice up here.

755
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:17,120
- It's high, isn't it?
- It's not bad once you're up here.

756
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:20,540
- It's not high up there?
- Your face is white as a ghost.

757
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:23,370
- You look like you're scared.
- Are you nervous?

758
00:35:23,370 --> 00:35:26,380
- You look like you're scared.
- You know what he said earlier?

759
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:29,120
He said he actually is scared, but he doesn't
want to show it since it's a variety show.

760
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:31,070
No, that's not what I said.

761
00:35:31,070 --> 00:35:32,780
But that since this is a variety show,
it is okay to show that I'm scared.

762
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:34,420
- Since this is my first time doing it.
- Of course.

763
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:36,640
- No! You have to look cool.
- Really?

764
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,360
You have to always look cool.

765
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:40,110
Shall we get started?

766
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:43,400
- He's scared right now.
- You can see his hesitation.

767
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,730
- Okay, the human bullet is going to jump.
- Okay.

768
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:47,710
It would actually be weirder
if he wasn't scared.

769
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:50,100
[First human bullet, Jang Woo Sung
is locked and loaded!]

770
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:53,860
[The fear is only momentary...]

771
00:35:57,330 --> 00:36:00,850
[In this moment, I am free...]

772
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:18,320
[Into the water?]

773
00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:26,210
[And in that crevice of all places?]

774
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,560
That was such a bad show.

775
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,050
That was awful.

776
00:36:32,050 --> 00:36:34,830
He fell in the water!

777
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:40,170
- He fell in the water.
- That was hilarious.

778
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,190
What are you doing, Woo Sung?

779
00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:45,340
[The power of the Blob Jump turns even
the coolest man in Korea into a comedian.]

780
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:50,850
[Instantly transforming him into someone who's
more like friend from your neighborhood.]

781
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:52,890
That's not at all the image I've seen of him
portrayed in his movies.

782
00:36:52,890 --> 00:36:55,210
I was shocked for a moment thinking
that you weren't wearing any pants.

783
00:36:57,250 --> 00:37:00,510
[Assuming his cool demeanor once again
no matter what the others are saying.]

784
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:02,820
Don't pretend to be cool now.

785
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:04,980
It's already too late.
We've seen what you're really like.

786
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:07,960
This is entertainment.

787
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,500
- Is that what you call it?
- He's good.

788
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,610
[Belatedly realizing how funny he can be.]

789
00:37:12,810 --> 00:37:14,940
- That's really high up.
- Woo Sung.

790
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:17,800
- Don't you feel confident about it now?
- It's no longer scary, right?

791
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,550
- Not scary, right? It's no big deal.
- Yes, you're right.

792
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:22,400
But why did you fall in the water?

793
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:25,560
There's a little gap between that thing.

794
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:27,880
- There's a gap.
- Are you okay?

795
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:30,070
They should've told us that
there's a gap.

796
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:34,050
I'm sorry, but if you fall again,
we'll go after that.

797
00:37:34,050 --> 00:37:36,460
If you feel bad about saying it,
then don't say it at all.

798
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:40,030
- We want to take our turn.
- Woo Sung's good at physical gags.

799
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:42,510
[And it's twice as funny seeing someone who's
normally so cool doing funny gags.]

800
00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:46,090
If Woo Sung does it again this time,
you guys can take your turn.

801
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:47,170
Yes, okay.

802
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:50,780
- You're no longer nervous, right?
- Yes, of course.

803
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:53,960
[There was a deep meaning behind all this?
So that they'd shed their nervous energy?]

804
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:56,950
- We really did shed our nervous energy.
- That was too funny.

805
00:37:57,350 --> 00:37:59,990
- That was too funny.
- This is your last chance.

806
00:37:59,990 --> 00:38:04,590
Of all the male guests we've had thus far,
he is the funniest with physical gags.

807
00:38:04,590 --> 00:38:06,940
[Funniest physical gags out of all the
male guests they've had so far.]

808
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:08,190
Fighting!

809
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:10,010
But I... no, okay.

810
00:38:11,170 --> 00:38:14,600
- If you have something to say, then say it.
- He lost his desire to speak.

811
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,150
- Let him concentrate.
- Okay, here I go.

812
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:17,980
[Woo Sung's second attempt at
becoming the human bullet.]

813
00:38:21,950 --> 00:38:24,220
[Again?]

814
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:36,520
[Two physical gags in a row.]

815
00:38:48,290 --> 00:38:51,890
Jung Woo Sung really is so funny.
Why is he just doing his first variety show?

816
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:54,840
Jung Woo Sung is the best of
all physical gag do-ers.

817
00:38:56,030 --> 00:39:00,210
[Even the national MC is impressed with
his ability to make others laugh.]

818
00:39:03,490 --> 00:39:05,120
You're hilarious!

819
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:08,250
I can't believe how funny he is.

820
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,800
I keep wanting to make you guys laugh.

821
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,180
What are you doing?

822
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:16,780
[Even bigger laughs from his attempt
at trying to explain his reasoning.]

823
00:39:18,250 --> 00:39:22,990
[The ultimate actor, Jung Woo Sung...
And now, the ultimate bringer of laughter!]

824
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:26,990
<i>Okay, we're going to start
doing this seriously now.</i>

825
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:28,720
<i>Okay, Red Team's turn to go up.</i>

826
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:31,230
- This isn't easy.
- I feel like I'm boarding a plane.

827
00:39:31,230 --> 00:39:33,340
[Coach Kkuk is the first jumper
for the Red Team.]

828
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:35,590
- It doesn't look that high up from here.
- I know.

829
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:40,450
I know that people say that Running Man
is all about extreme games and sports...

830
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:44,540
But it's all about the eating games.
I ate all the watermelon, and now the water.

831
00:39:45,630 --> 00:39:47,820
- We're all about eating.
- Eating contests.

832
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:51,290
- Fighting!
- Fighting!

833
00:39:51,290 --> 00:39:53,440
I can understand what
you were feeling now, Woo Sung.

834
00:39:54,530 --> 00:39:56,390
Jump further than you think you should.

835
00:39:57,890 --> 00:39:59,500
[Red Team's Coach Kkuk is
locked and loaded, and ready to go!]

836
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,140
[Oh!]

837
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:09,510
[Oh! He gets himself situated!]

838
00:40:09,970 --> 00:40:12,350
But isn't he... oh, okay.

839
00:40:12,350 --> 00:40:14,750
- Suk Jin, you fall for longer than you think.
- What?

840
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:16,010
- Really?
- Yeah.

841
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:19,870
- This is scary.
- This looks scary.

842
00:40:21,310 --> 00:40:24,330
- It's pretty high up there.
- You have to jump all at once.

843
00:40:24,330 --> 00:40:26,130
- Challenge.
- Challenge!

844
00:40:26,130 --> 00:40:28,150
[Will they be able to
jump together simultaneously?]

845
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:30,230
- Let's go!
- Let's do this!

846
00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:32,090
- Fighting!
- Look straight ahead!

847
00:40:32,090 --> 00:40:35,630
One... two... three!

848
00:40:36,690 --> 00:40:37,750
Three!

849
00:40:40,370 --> 00:40:43,370
- Why are you jumping?
- Hey!

850
00:40:43,370 --> 00:40:45,060
Do it right!

851
00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:48,080
- Do it right!
- Cheer us on, Hyo Joo!

852
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:49,400
- Fighting!
- Fighting!

853
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:50,970
- You can do this!
- Fighting!

854
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:54,190
[Will they do it this time?]

855
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:56,980
One, two, three!

856
00:40:59,510 --> 00:41:01,320
[There they go!]

857
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:20,350
[A pretty high jump!]

858
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:25,210
[Coach Kkuk of the Red Team
succeeds at the Blob Jump!]

859
00:41:25,210 --> 00:41:27,130
- We did it!
- We did it!

860
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:35,440
- Did you see that?
- That was a pretty good jump.

861
00:41:36,730 --> 00:41:38,110
It's fun!

862
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:40,100
It's fun.

863
00:41:41,630 --> 00:41:45,470
- That wasn't so bad at all!
- That's how you do it.

864
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:49,610
- That's how you do it.
- It really hurt my butt when we fell through.

865
00:41:49,610 --> 00:41:51,040
It really stung my hips.

866
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:54,340
<i>Here's the record for Kim Jong Kook
and the Red Team.</i>

867
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:57,900
<i>Kim Jong Kook's record is, 5m 70cm.</i>

868
00:41:57,900 --> 00:41:59,680
[Coach Kkuk of the Red Team's
Blob Jump record- 5m 70cm.]

869
00:42:12,050 --> 00:42:14,300
[Nice, Coach Kkuk!]

870
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:17,400
- Nice, that was great.
- Hold hands when you jump.

871
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:21,570
- Hold hands and stay close when you jump.
- Stick close together.

872
00:42:21,570 --> 00:42:24,850
Okay, we can take care of it ourselves.
We'll do it ourselves.

873
00:42:24,850 --> 00:42:26,590
- We can do this.
- You should listen and learn from us.

874
00:42:26,590 --> 00:42:29,210
But even if you teach this team a lesson,
they don't have me.

875
00:42:29,670 --> 00:42:32,160
But we have Jung Woo Sung.

876
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:34,250
We're actually happier because
you're not on our team.

877
00:42:34,250 --> 00:42:38,090
[Blue Team's Jung Woo Sung
takes another attempt at the jump.]

878
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:41,070
- Are you not scared anymore?
- It's not scary anymore.

879
00:42:41,070 --> 00:42:44,420
- It's only scary right before you jump.
- You flew so high up in the air.

880
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:47,710
- This is really scary.
- This is no joke.

881
00:42:47,710 --> 00:42:49,320
- Should I go in the middle?
- Yeah, you go in the middle.

882
00:42:49,330 --> 00:42:51,100
Jung Woo Sung, fighting!

883
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:53,700
- One, two...
- Then we land like this.

884
00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:56,990
- We're all set. We're going to win this.
- We're good.

885
00:42:56,990 --> 00:42:58,790
- You can trust us, Woo Sung.
- Okay.

886
00:42:58,790 --> 00:43:00,710
- Here I go.
- Okay. You can do it.

887
00:43:02,630 --> 00:43:05,240
- Stop worrying about us.
- This parts harder than you'd think.

888
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:09,160
I'm even more concerned about
making the same mistake again.

889
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:11,950
I'm more concerned about falling
through the cracks again.

890
00:43:12,350 --> 00:43:14,370
- I know.
- Show them how to do it.

891
00:43:14,370 --> 00:43:17,570
[What if I fall in the water again?]

892
00:43:17,570 --> 00:43:19,770
- They're going to think you're scared.
- It's not because I'm scared.

893
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:25,940
- He did it.
- He did it this time.

894
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:27,580
[He does it this time!]

895
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:30,270
- Nice job, Woo Sung!
- You're so happy about it!

896
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:34,270
I've succeeded my mission now.
Am I finished?

897
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:37,740
- No? Do I need to go up further?
- You have to go up to the front.

898
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:40,860
You have to go up
to the front point of the tube.

899
00:43:42,730 --> 00:43:46,350
- Don't be scared and jump, okay?
- But you looked scared right now.

900
00:43:46,350 --> 00:43:49,000
- No, I'm okay to jump.
- Look at him.

901
00:43:49,010 --> 00:43:51,560
- The three scaredy cats are up there.
- This is going to be fun.

902
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:53,080
[Will they be able to jump?]

903
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:54,960
This is funny.
This is way fun.

904
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:57,660
Trust in each other
and jump on the count of three.

905
00:43:57,660 --> 00:43:59,760
[That's easier said than done...]

906
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:01,290
Okay, I'm ready.

907
00:44:02,050 --> 00:44:04,110
Let's all do this with our legs.

908
00:44:04,110 --> 00:44:06,370
[None of the three look like
they want to jump on the tube.]

909
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:10,120
- Woo Sung, are you ready?
- I'm ready!

910
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:13,590
[Moments before Jung Woo Sung's
first Blob Jump!]

911
00:44:13,850 --> 00:44:16,630
- Two...
- Let us count.

912
00:44:16,630 --> 00:44:18,470
It's up to us to count.
You can't count for us.

913
00:44:18,470 --> 00:44:20,280
- Don't be scared.
- We'll do it.

914
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:24,150
- We can't get scared.
- We have to do this for the jump.

915
00:44:24,150 --> 00:44:25,350
- This is fun!
- Let's do this quickly.

916
00:44:25,350 --> 00:44:27,620
[Pathetic...]

917
00:44:29,190 --> 00:44:31,410
Hurry up and jump!

918
00:44:31,410 --> 00:44:33,570
- All together.
- Set, go.

919
00:44:33,570 --> 00:44:35,940
One, two, three!

920
00:44:40,610 --> 00:44:42,480
[Jump]

921
00:44:51,170 --> 00:44:52,670
There you go!

922
00:44:56,650 --> 00:45:00,690
[Jung Woo Sung's blob jump... Success!]

923
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:04,970
[Even though he's flailing around
in the air...]

924
00:45:04,970 --> 00:45:06,790
[He falls into the water with flair!]

925
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:13,390
- We did it.
- That was a nice job done.

926
00:45:13,390 --> 00:45:15,330
[Satisfied]

927
00:45:15,790 --> 00:45:18,550
- He didn't fly up too high.
- No, that wasn't very high up.

928
00:45:18,550 --> 00:45:21,170
[What's the record for
Blue Team's Woo Sung?]

929
00:45:22,180 --> 00:45:26,650
[Woo Sung finally succeeds
on his third attempt.]

930
00:45:26,970 --> 00:45:29,130
- No, you did get some height.
- Is it fun?

931
00:45:29,130 --> 00:45:33,350
It really is fun. But I wanted to turn my
body but I couldn't get it to do that.

932
00:45:33,350 --> 00:45:35,190
Good, that was a good job.

933
00:45:35,630 --> 00:45:39,490
[The highest record thus far is
Jong Kook's at 5m 70cm.]

934
00:45:39,490 --> 00:45:41,960
- Blue Team's is, 5m...
- Is it more than 5m?

935
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:47,470
[Woo Sung of the Blue Team's record...
5m... 10cm.]

936
00:45:57,320 --> 00:46:00,560
- Okay, we did it.
- You were off sync and fell after us.

937
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:04,580
- I think a lighter person needs to do it.
- It's all about the weight.

938
00:46:04,580 --> 00:46:09,010
We're warning you right now,
we're going to beat our previous record.

939
00:46:09,010 --> 00:46:11,380
Junho is going to take the challenge
and be the jumper this time.

940
00:46:11,380 --> 00:46:13,290
Junho's already jumping?
He's the ace of that team.

941
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:15,670
Are we supposed to be scared
of that warning right now?

942
00:46:15,670 --> 00:46:16,820
At least be nervous about it.

943
00:46:16,820 --> 00:46:18,440
- You're not scared?
- No, I'm not scared.

944
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:23,580
I think jumping together in sync is
the most important thing.

945
00:46:23,610 --> 00:46:25,520
[As predicted, the most important thing is
for the three back jumpers to be in sync.]

946
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:27,860
Do you know what you guys looked like?

947
00:46:27,860 --> 00:46:31,190
Instead of you guys hearing each other,
you all had the same blank look on your face.

948
00:46:31,190 --> 00:46:33,460
- Like this.
- We were all thinking about something else.

949
00:46:33,460 --> 00:46:35,230
Yeah, we were thinking about
something else.

950
00:46:35,230 --> 00:46:36,920
But it really is scary up there.

951
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:39,250
You have to break all the records.
You're our ace.

952
00:46:39,250 --> 00:46:41,350
[Second jumper for the Red Team- Junho!]

953
00:46:41,350 --> 00:46:43,090
- Let's fly!
- Make it so they can't even attempt it.

954
00:46:43,090 --> 00:46:45,380
- Be quick like we were!
- Can I go now?

955
00:46:45,380 --> 00:46:47,450
It's not as easy as it looks.

956
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:54,040
[Jumps without any hesitation
and falls on the tube safely.]

957
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:55,820
- That's our ace!
- He's our ace!

958
00:46:55,820 --> 00:46:57,890
- That's good.
- You're going to get the best record.

959
00:46:58,740 --> 00:47:00,080
This is tough.

960
00:47:01,060 --> 00:47:04,510
Even though our record may be low,
no one can be funnier than us!

961
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:08,010
[No one can even come close.]

962
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:11,030
And not just once, but twice!

963
00:47:12,260 --> 00:47:14,390
- Kick up your leg and lean on your back.
- Jump at once?

964
00:47:14,390 --> 00:47:16,900
- Lay on your back or stare out front?
- You have to stare out front.

965
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:18,950
[Why are they talking so much
when all they need to do is jump?]

966
00:47:19,260 --> 00:47:20,820
Okay, ready?

967
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:23,610
- Okay, ready?
- Jump on three.

968
00:47:23,610 --> 00:47:25,330
- Am I good to trust you?
- Here we go!

969
00:47:25,330 --> 00:47:27,620
This is fun!
This is really enjoyable!

970
00:47:28,010 --> 00:47:29,830
- Okay, I'll do it.
- No hesitating, okay?

971
00:47:29,830 --> 00:47:31,820
- We have to jump, okay?
- Jump all at once.

972
00:47:31,820 --> 00:47:34,730
Here we go!
One, two, three!

973
00:47:34,730 --> 00:47:37,400
[Look straight ahead... and jump!]

974
00:47:47,540 --> 00:47:49,060
We're going to lose.

975
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:56,780
[This is...
what you call acrobatic diving.]

976
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:05,890
[Junho of the Red Team succeeds
the blob jump with flair!]

977
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:11,560
How did it turn out?

978
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:13,270
- Was it good?
- That was awesome!

979
00:48:14,970 --> 00:48:16,880
- That was great!
- The Red Team's record...

980
00:48:17,340 --> 00:48:21,180
The record is, 6m 36cm.

981
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:35,780
- How was it, Hyo Joo!
- You guys were so cool!

982
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:40,300
- Why are you looking at us like that?
- What's with the expression, Ji Hyo?

983
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:42,190
- We can do better.
- Trust us.

984
00:48:42,190 --> 00:48:45,290
- Woo Sung's going to be in the middle now.
- Don't you worry!

985
00:48:45,290 --> 00:48:47,580
- I'll do it this time.
- That was so cool.

986
00:48:47,820 --> 00:48:52,320
I really wasn't thinking of anything,
but when I was lifted up into the air...

987
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:54,640
- When that happened, my mind went blank.
- Really?

988
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:58,280
- How does it feel up in the air?
- You have your legs spread apart in the air

989
00:48:58,280 --> 00:49:01,750
so when you're up there, your body is flailing
and you're unable to control your body.

990
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:06,270
Is there a need for us to dissect
and pull it apart detail by detail like this?

991
00:49:06,270 --> 00:49:08,650
- I'm just telling you how it is.
- Lets just be happy about it.

992
00:49:08,650 --> 00:49:10,210
Let's just enjoy this moment.

993
00:49:10,940 --> 00:49:13,980
[Second jumper for the Red Team-
Yoo Jae Suk.]

994
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:21,550
[Hates anything up high,
and hates jumping off of it even more!]

995
00:49:21,550 --> 00:49:24,580
[But I still have to jump!]

996
00:49:24,580 --> 00:49:26,850
Keep your eyes straight ahead!

997
00:49:27,830 --> 00:49:29,010
Okay, here I go!

998
00:49:37,630 --> 00:49:41,960
[After a nice fall... kerplunk.]

999
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:45,670
[No one beats this guy
in the comedy department...]

1000
00:49:47,740 --> 00:49:49,830
- But I had a nice fall!
- That was too funny.

1001
00:49:49,830 --> 00:49:53,070
[Seeing him trying so hard not to fall
in the water is even funnier.]

1002
00:49:54,210 --> 00:49:56,170
- Did you hear him while he was falling?
- Hey!

1003
00:49:56,170 --> 00:49:58,400
I'm going to have to do that again!

1004
00:49:58,980 --> 00:50:02,060
Once that happens,
that's all you're concerned about.

1005
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:07,930
This is driving me nuts.

1006
00:50:11,100 --> 00:50:12,560
I can't believe that happened.

1007
00:50:12,950 --> 00:50:15,680
- Jung Woo Sung had to do it twice.
- You have to jump towards the middle.

1008
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:17,590
- How did I jump?
- I'm not sure either.

1009
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:20,250
- You can't let Woo Sung beat you.
- You know what the important thing is?

1010
00:50:20,260 --> 00:50:23,050
I bet Woo Sung's feeling much better
about himself right now.

1011
00:50:23,050 --> 00:50:26,320
[Junior in the gag reel department
feeling slightly better now.]

1012
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:28,080
Now that someone else besides
himself did what he did.

1013
00:50:28,090 --> 00:50:30,330
That is really tiring though.
Okay, here I go again.

1014
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:33,390
[Jae Suk, locked and loaded!]

1015
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:41,450
[Smack dab in the middle this time.]

1016
00:50:41,450 --> 00:50:42,810
Ugh, that was scary.

1017
00:50:42,810 --> 00:50:44,830
I seriously feel like I'm going to die.

1018
00:50:46,020 --> 00:50:49,200
It's simple. Land on your butt.
It won't hurt on your butt.

1019
00:50:49,970 --> 00:50:52,870
[It's time for the three to jump again.]

1020
00:50:52,870 --> 00:50:55,310
- Set your right foot over here.
- Fighting!

1021
00:50:55,310 --> 00:50:59,030
- Okay.
- Okay, one, two, three.

1022
00:51:11,970 --> 00:51:13,260
There you go!

1023
00:51:19,180 --> 00:51:20,430
Awesome!

1024
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:22,470
Awesome!

1025
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:25,730
Wow, that was good!

1026
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:29,950
[Flying... straight up in the air!]

1027
00:51:29,950 --> 00:51:31,600
That was awesome!

1028
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:35,010
[Even at a quick glance,
it's sure to be a great record!]

1029
00:51:35,020 --> 00:51:36,410
You did it!

1030
00:51:37,850 --> 00:51:39,700
- That was good.
- That was higher than mine?

1031
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:44,710
[My goodness... Jae Suk did that?]

1032
00:51:45,210 --> 00:51:47,070
<i>The Blue Team's record is...</i>

1033
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:50,790
<i>7m 28cm.</i>

1034
00:51:50,790 --> 00:51:55,080
[Jae Suk of the Blue Team's record is-
7m 28cm!]

1035
00:52:04,370 --> 00:52:05,650
Awesome!

1036
00:52:07,620 --> 00:52:10,830
[The welcome party?]

1037
00:52:10,830 --> 00:52:14,210
I saw him screaming in terror as he was
lifted up into the air.

1038
00:52:14,210 --> 00:52:17,840
[Flailing as a grasshopper would
leaping through the air.]

1039
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:21,090
But it wasn't as bad as I thought.
Up to this point.

1040
00:52:21,450 --> 00:52:25,260
- To where?
- You have to keep your head up not to turn.

1041
00:52:25,260 --> 00:52:28,300
Relax your body, sit up
and don't be tense about it.

1042
00:52:28,310 --> 00:52:29,970
- Okay.
- So you're listening to me now?

1043
00:52:31,150 --> 00:52:33,900
- Listen to me, and I'll tell you about it.
- I don't think he's right for it.

1044
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:36,330
Woo Sung was a better jumper.

1045
00:52:36,330 --> 00:52:38,130
You have to relax your body
and don't be tense.

1046
00:52:38,980 --> 00:52:42,490
[But they were just saying the three jumpers
in the back did a good job...]

1047
00:52:42,490 --> 00:52:44,310
Listen to me after you listen
to Woo Sung.

1048
00:52:44,310 --> 00:52:47,570
- Listen and learn!
- You weigh a lot, right, Woo Sung?

1049
00:52:47,570 --> 00:52:50,210
No, no.
This is all about being in sync.

1050
00:52:50,210 --> 00:52:51,590
- How much do you weigh?
- You have to be in sync.

1051
00:52:51,590 --> 00:52:53,860
- Just tell us how much you weigh.
- Why, how much do you weigh?

1052
00:52:53,860 --> 00:52:56,720
- How much do you think I weigh?
- 85 kg?

1053
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:59,520
- Are we going to do this or not?
- I weigh 80kg.

1054
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:01,870
- 80?
- Don't lie to us.

1055
00:53:01,870 --> 00:53:03,840
- But I weigh 78kg.
- I'm serious.

1056
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:05,780
- Why did you get so fat? Lose some weight.
- What did you say?

1057
00:53:05,780 --> 00:53:08,710
- How am I heavy?
- How much do you all weigh?

1058
00:53:08,710 --> 00:53:10,680
- Lose some weight!
- I weigh 78kg.

1059
00:53:10,690 --> 00:53:13,730
- That's not too heavy.
- We did a good job with our jump.

1060
00:53:13,730 --> 00:53:15,460
- Yeah, you did really good.
- I got that feeling.

1061
00:53:15,820 --> 00:53:19,170
- Why are you standing like that?
- I'm just hanging my fingers.

1062
00:53:20,730 --> 00:53:22,370
Because it's comfortable?

1063
00:53:22,750 --> 00:53:24,260
Because it's comfortable?

1064
00:53:24,260 --> 00:53:27,530
[What's wrong with you...]

1065
00:53:27,540 --> 00:53:29,760
- What's wrong with you?
- Is it your first time?

1066
00:53:29,770 --> 00:53:31,090
Just pretend you didn't see that.

1067
00:53:31,900 --> 00:53:32,990
Like we didn't see it?

1068
00:53:33,390 --> 00:53:38,840
[Current highest record-
Jae Suk of the Blue Team's 7m 28cm.]

1069
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:45,740
[Blue Team's final jumper is Ace Ji Hyo!]

1070
00:53:46,510 --> 00:53:47,630
There you go!

1071
00:53:50,540 --> 00:53:52,650
- You're doing good.
- Did you see her do that?

1072
00:53:53,370 --> 00:53:55,110
That's how you do it, Hyo Joo.

1073
00:53:55,110 --> 00:53:59,640
[The three back jumpers are-
Woo Sung, Jae Suk and Ha Ha.]

1074
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:01,630
We need to do it quickly
once Ji Hyo is ready.

1075
00:54:01,630 --> 00:54:03,770
Let's see what you can do, Song Ji Hyo!

1076
00:54:04,670 --> 00:54:07,840
[We'll help Ace Ji Hyo fly into the air!]

1077
00:54:08,620 --> 00:54:09,990
- Okay, here we go.
- Okay!

1078
00:54:10,860 --> 00:54:12,860
[Here we go!]

1079
00:54:22,050 --> 00:54:24,790
[Ji Hyo is airborne!]

1080
00:54:32,100 --> 00:54:34,270
[Unbelievable height!]

1081
00:54:37,850 --> 00:54:42,650
[Even though it's just for a little while,
it's like flying through the air!]

1082
00:54:48,670 --> 00:54:50,290
How was Ji Hyo?

1083
00:54:53,350 --> 00:54:56,070
[Our fearless ace!]

1084
00:54:56,070 --> 00:54:58,860
[Totally psyched up!]

1085
00:54:58,860 --> 00:55:00,350
- That was so much fun!
- Are you okay, Ji Hyo?

1086
00:55:00,350 --> 00:55:02,190
- It's fun?
- She says that was fun!

1087
00:55:02,190 --> 00:55:05,570
- That was no joke!
- I bet she got at least 9m!

1088
00:55:05,570 --> 00:55:07,250
I feel like she got 10m on that.

1089
00:55:07,250 --> 00:55:09,930
[She's not our ace for nothing!]

1090
00:55:11,820 --> 00:55:17,180
[Blue Team's mood is definitely uplifted!]

1091
00:55:17,180 --> 00:55:19,290
- Ji Hyo, you're the best!
- That was awesome!

1092
00:55:19,290 --> 00:55:20,790
Okay, the record is...

1093
00:55:20,790 --> 00:55:22,580
She scored the highest record.

1094
00:55:22,580 --> 00:55:25,530
- Yes!
- 7m 86cm!

1095
00:55:25,530 --> 00:55:29,480
[Ace Ji Hyo of the Blue Team's record-
7m 86cm!]

1096
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:30,890
That was awesome.

1097
00:55:39,620 --> 00:55:40,910
What happened to Ji Hyo?

1098
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:44,810
Woo Sung was very good to lead.

1099
00:55:44,810 --> 00:55:47,540
- No, it was all teamwork.
- When I was up in the air...

1100
00:55:47,540 --> 00:55:50,340
When I saw the water below me...
that was amazing!

1101
00:55:50,340 --> 00:55:53,320
That was so much fun.
I could see all the water beneath me.

1102
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:57,480
[This may have to become Running Man's
new repertoire for our Blank Ji.]

1103
00:55:57,490 --> 00:55:59,120
I saw her face when she
was up in the air.

1104
00:55:59,120 --> 00:56:01,520
She had the biggest grin on her face.

1105
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:03,910
[Ace Ji Hyo with a huge grin on her face
in the middle of the air.]

1106
00:56:04,700 --> 00:56:07,070
But my butt really hurts right now.

1107
00:56:07,460 --> 00:56:09,290
Your butt hurts?
Let me see.

1108
00:56:10,530 --> 00:56:12,310
I guess I can't do anything for her.

1109
00:56:12,310 --> 00:56:14,660
That was the most fun ever.

1110
00:56:14,660 --> 00:56:18,240
The Red Team has to beat their record of
7m 86cm.

1111
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:20,870
I think Hyo Joo is going to fly really high.

1112
00:56:20,870 --> 00:56:23,300
If you beat this,
your next movie is going to be a hit.

1113
00:56:23,300 --> 00:56:24,390
Challenge!

1114
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:28,680
- Challenge!
- I can't believe how that got her.

1115
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:31,290
[Will Hyo Joo of the Red Team be able to
beat the record of 7m 86cm?]

1116
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:36,480
[Hyo Joo following Ji Hyo's method.]

1117
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:38,330
- You're doing great!
- That was good, Hyo Joo.

1118
00:56:42,340 --> 00:56:44,130
Let's break the 8m record.

1119
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:47,120
Hyo Joo.... fighting!
Let's win this thing.

1120
00:56:47,120 --> 00:56:48,500
8m, okay?

1121
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:50,560
There's nothing to this, guys.

1122
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:53,240
Let's practice our timing.
One, two, three.

1123
00:56:53,240 --> 00:56:55,640
Okay?
Just keep your eyes straight ahead.

1124
00:56:55,640 --> 00:56:56,790
Okay?

1125
00:56:56,790 --> 00:56:59,620
Hyo Joo!
Look up into the sky.

1126
00:57:00,180 --> 00:57:03,250
[Sky...]

1127
00:57:04,490 --> 00:57:05,820
Hey, Han Hyo Joo!

1128
00:57:06,950 --> 00:57:08,430
What are you doing?

1129
00:57:09,580 --> 00:57:11,760
- I think she's scared.
- No, she's just ready for you guys.

1130
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:13,280
Okay, here we go!

1131
00:57:14,810 --> 00:57:17,160
- Let's practice one more time.
- Just jump!

1132
00:57:17,160 --> 00:57:19,910

[The battle begins now!]

1465
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:20,740
This is such a huge place.

[It is a large space...]

1467
01:15:24,710 --> 01:15:27,370
[But jumping right into the battle!]

[It's Mr. Capable!]

1469

[The Tiger and the Giraffe
working together.]

1471

Come on.

1473
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:48,770
[I need to hurry and find my teammates!]

1474

He's been eliminated.

1485
01:16:42,560 --> 01:16:44,860
[A few minutes ago]

1486
01:16:44,860 --> 01:16:47,500
- Suk Jin...
- It hasn't even been a minute.

1487
01:16:47,500 --> 01:16:50,100
- You know what's going to happen.
- I'll give you inside information.

1488
01:16:50,580 --> 01:16:52,150
- What information?
- Then you need to run.

1489
01:16:52,150 --> 01:16:53,520

[Rustling up the battlefield
in less than a minute.]

1497
01:17:13,360 --> 01:17:14,500
That's just unbelievable.

1498
01:17:14,500 --> 01:17:16,130
It's Kim Jong Kook.
Jong Kook is coming.

1499
01:17:17,990 --> 01:17:19,290
Do you know where you're going?

1500
01:17:22,160 --> 01:17:26,660
[Suk Jin- Out!]

1501
01:17:29,090 --> 01:17:30,270

- Where have you been?

1505
01:17:41,480 --> 01:17:43,390
- We've been searching for you everywhere.
- We're in trouble.

1506
01:17:43,390 --> 01:17:45,170
Did you hear Suk Jin getting ousted?

1507
01:17:45,180 --> 01:17:48,420
I've been waiting here this whole time
thinking you guys were coming.

1508
01:17:48,420 --> 01:17:50,740
- They're headed this way right now.
- This is the tallest point here.

1509
01:17:51,570 --> 01:17:52,990
Let's move in.

1510
01:17:52,990 --> 01:17:55,530
- Let's get them all.
- Let's battle it out.

[Both teams heading towards
the same direction.]

1513
01:18:02,190 --> 01:18:03,570
There they are.

1514
01:18:05,140 --> 01:18:06,970
Should we call them out one at a time?

1515
01:18:07,960 --> 01:18:10,180
- Wow, this is kind of cool.
- It's like a siege.

1516
01:18:10,190 --> 01:18:12,140
[Feels like a siege warfare.]

1517
01:18:12,140 --> 01:18:14,400
- Should we call them out one at a time?
- Hey!

1518
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:16,090
This is our castle!

1519
01:18:16,770 --> 01:18:18,510
One of you, come out!

1520
01:18:19,430 --> 01:18:21,370
One of you come in here!

1521
01:18:22,210 --> 01:18:25,000
You cowards!
One of you come out here!

1522
01:18:25,530 --> 01:18:27,230
What did you say?

1523
01:18:28,670 --> 01:18:31,570
[General Giraffe being easily provoked.]

1524
01:18:31,570 --> 01:18:33,950
- Don't fall for it, Lee Kwang Soo!
- Don't fall for it!

1525
01:18:33,950 --> 01:18:35,410
Don't fall for it!

1526
01:18:35,410 --> 01:18:38,220
- Let's go for a round.
- That's what I want too.

1527
01:18:38,220 --> 01:18:40,020
- Let's go for a round.
- No, Kwang Soo.

1528
01:18:40,020 --> 01:18:41,910
- You're too far out. Step back quickly.
- Really?

1529
01:18:41,910 --> 01:18:43,100
You're too far out.

1530
01:18:43,100 --> 01:18:45,200
Look at the way you're retreating.

1531
01:18:46,110 --> 01:18:48,180
He's just trying to provoke you.
It's just a provocation.

1532
01:18:48,180 --> 01:18:50,080
- Why you little!
- He's just provoking you.

1533
01:18:51,370 --> 01:18:54,640
[Provocation, a success...]

1534
01:18:56,300 --> 01:18:58,960
- Come here, beanpole.
- Let me just say one thing.

1535
01:18:58,960 --> 01:19:02,830
Your luxury ice box
is already in our possession.

1536
01:19:05,580 --> 01:19:06,950
Lee Kwang Soo.

1537
01:19:07,570 --> 01:19:09,270
Are you rice?

1538
01:19:11,050 --> 01:19:13,510
- Why do you assume that I'm the rice?
- Look at how angry you are.

1539
01:19:13,510 --> 01:19:15,750
- Come out here.
- No!

1540
01:19:15,760 --> 01:19:17,970
- No, don't go.
- Why do you assume that I'm the rice?

1541
01:19:17,970 --> 01:19:19,300
Come out here.

1542
01:19:19,790 --> 01:19:21,190
[Me?]

1543
01:19:21,190 --> 01:19:23,230
- Go get rid of that kiddo.
- Kiddo!

1544
01:19:23,230 --> 01:19:27,600
[General Kiddo continuing to provoke
General Giraffe.]

1545
01:19:27,950 --> 01:19:29,160
Get out here!

1546
01:19:30,200 --> 01:19:32,800
- Man to man!
- Let's do this one on one!

1547
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:34,150
[A real man to man battle atop
the wooden bridge.]

1548
01:19:34,150 --> 01:19:35,690
On top of this wooden bridge...

1549
01:19:35,690 --> 01:19:37,720
[Kiddo warrior who's special skill
is to verbally attack...]

1550
01:19:37,720 --> 01:19:40,290
[vs. Warrior Giraffe who's specialty
is to betray.]

1551
01:19:40,350 --> 01:19:44,110

meeting atop the wooden bridge.]

1552

[Kiddo breaking out his strange
martial arts moves.]

1554
01:19:57,480 --> 01:19:59,380
- Ugh, this is so aggravating!
- I don't think this is going to work.

1555
01:19:59,380 --> 01:20:00,910
- Ugh!
- This isn't going to work.

1556
01:20:04,420 --> 01:20:05,910
You hit me twice!

1557
01:20:07,180 --> 01:20:09,500
- I saw you gripping your fist.
- No, you didn't!

1558
01:20:09,500 --> 01:20:10,940
You're shorter than me!

1559
01:20:13,070 --> 01:20:15,120
I feel like I'm watching an
entertaining show.

1560

[Finally facing each other off
in battle of strength?]

[Ambush?
Making their moves into the castle?]

1562
01:20:28,330 --> 01:20:29,640
Move in!

Simultaneously out!]

Mr. Capable without any hesitation.]

- You got him!
- It's okay.

1577
01:21:25,060 --> 01:21:27,530
[There they go!]

1578
01:21:28,060 --> 01:21:30,590
[His hand is...]

1579
01:21:31,070 --> 01:21:34,530
[Just who...]

1580
01:21:46,060 --> 01:21:48,350
[Wow, Woo Sung gets him first!]

1581
01:21:49,660 --> 01:21:52,840
[Jong Kook- Out!]

1582

[Everyone shocked at Woo Sung's victory!]

1583
01:21:55,970 --> 01:21:57,930
See what Jong Kook had.

1584
01:21:59,880 --> 01:22:01,930
Rice.

1585
01:22:01,930 --> 01:22:03,630
[On Jong Kook's back is... rice.]

1586
01:22:05,340 --> 01:22:07,310
[Let's get out of here!]

1587
01:22:16,370 --> 01:22:19,670
[Outnumbered...
only method now is to ambush!]

1588
01:22:20,960 --> 01:22:23,050
[As predicted, not falling for the trap!]

1589
01:22:24,500 --> 01:22:25,850
Junho.

1590
01:22:25,850 --> 01:22:27,770
Yesterday's humiliation...

1591
01:22:30,160 --> 01:22:32,550

a formidable opponent.]

[Junho- Out!]

1598
01:23:11,750 --> 01:23:15,030
And thus,
today's victory goes to the Blue Team.

1599
01:23:15,030 --> 01:23:17,600
[Blue Team- Final Winners.]

1600
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:21,710
You can divide up the prizes
however you'd like except for the picnic mat.

1601
01:23:21,710 --> 01:23:24,930
So except for the picnic mat?

1602
01:23:24,930 --> 01:23:27,820
Why don't you give it to Ji Hyo and Gary
for the wedding dowry?

1603
01:23:27,820 --> 01:23:30,140
- Really?
- That's a great idea.

1604
01:23:30,150 --> 01:23:32,840
- If they get married, then okay.
- Then is that tent our home?

[Starting their newly married life
in the cozy tent?]

1606

Hang on. Hyo Joo's really been
wanting the espresso machine.

1607
01:23:39,220 --> 01:23:40,690
- Really?
- Yes.

1608
01:23:41,140 --> 01:23:44,950
What about you, Woo Sung?
Tell us if there's anything you need.

1609
01:23:44,950 --> 01:23:49,170
As for me...
I'd like Hyo Joo's espresso machine.

1610
01:23:49,170 --> 01:23:50,740
- You're saying you want it for yourself?
- Yes.

1611
01:23:52,770 --> 01:23:54,790
- He's so greedy!
- He's hilarious!

1612
01:23:54,790 --> 01:23:57,030
- Take the TV.
- In that case...

1613
01:23:58,410 --> 01:24:00,710
I'll take the espresso machine
and the TV.

1614
01:24:03,950 --> 01:24:05,330
How beautiful!

1615
01:24:06,860 --> 01:24:08,420
How beautiful!

[June, 19th, 2013- Incheon Songdo.]

1620
01:24:20,330 --> 01:24:22,660
Have you seen this?

1621
01:24:24,060 --> 01:24:28,320
- But before Park Ji Sung comes out...
- Is she coming?

1622
01:24:28,320 --> 01:24:29,480
No, no.

1623
01:24:31,740 --> 01:24:35,840
Other guests who will be joining us
will come out to join us.

1624
01:24:35,840 --> 01:24:37,670
- There's another guest?
- Not who we're thinking?

1625
01:24:38,370 --> 01:24:40,240
I see someone coming.
