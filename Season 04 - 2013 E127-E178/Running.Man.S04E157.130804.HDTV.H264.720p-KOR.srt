Lying about things that never even happened
is not a very nice thing to be doing.

Why?

- He looks like Beethoven.
- He looks like a composer.

107
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:45,850
You need to address him in honorifics.

Why are you bumbling your statement?

127
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,010
Why don't you wear some pants?
Get some pants on.

128
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,990
Is that any way to dress in
the courtroom?

129
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:02,850
- It's the latest trend!
- Don't you know the latest trend?

130
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,540

these days helps to cool you down?

[Cool new business fashion that aids
in conserving energy and keeping cool.]

132

- This is the prosecutors' dress code.
- Sorry, but are the four of you in a choir?

133
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:16,620
[Singing in a choir would be better suited
for them than indicting someone?]

134
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:18,740
- Seriously... go on and speak.
- Okay.

135
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:22,540
Okay, this incident occurred in the waiting room
before the recording started around 2pm.

136
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:25,820

138
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:35,420

of his head when the lights went out.

139
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:36,600
[The victim was assaulted in the head
while the room was immersed in the blackout.]

140
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:39,280
Why are you saying that we were the ones
who hit you in the head?

141
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,190
Please remain silent.
We are still talking.

142
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:43,180
It wasn't in the back of my head.
I was hit in my ears.

143
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:44,910
- Your ears?
- One, two.

144
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:46,220
I was hit twice like that.

145
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:48,590
The legal term for that would be,
'The Earmuff Assault'.

146
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:50,020
Yes, I understand.

147
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:55,030
The defendants Jung Woong In, Ahn Gil Kang,
Kim Hee Won, and Lee Kwang Soo

148
00:07:55,030 --> 00:08:00,360
hit the victim, Ji Suk Jin in his occipitals
during the time of the blackout.

149
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,820
Also...

150
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:04,750
The situation in the waiting room...
who's phone is ringing!

151
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:09,400
Why are you getting angry
in the middle of the courtroom?

152
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:12,290
- Who keeps their phone on in the courtroom!
- No need for you to get so angry.

153
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:16,040
[Prosecutor Kkuk calms himself back down.]

154
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:20,490
It has been established that the four
defendants are guilty of co-conspiring.

155
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:23,340
- Therefore, the defendants...
- What are you talking about?

156
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:25,050
What?
Don't you know what co-conspiring is?

157
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:26,910
- Co-conspiring.
- You must've watched a lot of dramas.

158
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:31,290
Therefore, according to the
Criminal Procedural Act

159
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:34,570
Section 260, Article 1...

160
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:39,000
the prosecution indicts all four defendants
as the co-conspirators of the assault.

161
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:44,260
[Defendants- Indicted as
co-conspirators of the assault.]

162
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:46,260
- Defense may now make his statement.
- Okay.

163
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:53,000
My defendants deny their charge of being
co-conspirators of the assault.

164
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:57,930
- You can't do that!
- I was hit twice in my ears!

165
00:08:57,930 --> 00:08:59,270
Honorable Judge.

166
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:03,050
These defendants did not hit
the victim, Ji Suk Jin in the head.

167
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:04,670
- Isn't that correct?
- Yes.

168
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:07,950
The victim is claiming that he was hit in
the head during the blackout

169
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:10,210
but the defendants was not aware
that there was going to be a blackout.

170
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:11,260
What did you say?

171
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:12,760
We were all shocked just like you!

172
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,380
- I was hit in both of my ears!
- And also...

173
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:18,240
The victim, Ji Suk Jin states that he was
the receiver of the Earmuffs Assault...

174
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,030
I was hit twice!

175
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:23,820
But the defendants weren't even aware
that he was hit in the head.

176
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:29,600
There was no need to follow Ji Suk Jin
and assault him in his ears like that

177
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:35,700
nor was there any reason to do that as
the prosecution stand is stating.

178
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,270
This charge of co-conspiracy
is an absurd accusation.

179
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:39,500
- What did you say?
- Do you even know what you're saying?

180
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:42,110
- You're a culprit too!
- What did you say?

181
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:44,380
Look at the goodness
radiating from these men!

182
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:46,030
How could you think that any one of us
could've assaulted him like that?

183
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:52,210
[Do you see...
the goodness radiating from me?]

184
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:55,650
I can't even look at defendant
number three in the eyes.

185
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:58,380
[Ahn Gil Kang with a fierce
glint in his eyes.]

186
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:01,140
Someone switch seats with me!

187
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:03,870
Silence!

188
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:06,190
Anymore outbursts, and everyone
will be kicked out of the courtroom.

189
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,830
[Anymore outbursts from the crowd,
and they'll be kicked out of the courtroom.]

190
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:11,030
Honorable Judge,
I'd like to question the four defendants.

191
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:12,600
Yes, you may start your line
of questioning.

192
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:16,060
Are the defendants aware of why
they're put on the stand today?

193
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:17,590
We don't even know why we're here.

194
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:20,550
What kind of an impression do
you believe that you normally portray?

195
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:23,340
I believe that we look very innocent.

196
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:27,170
I'd first like to question
defendant Jung Woong In.

197
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:32,970
What is the role that you play in the
recent drama, 'I Hear Your Voice'?

198
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:35,270
I play Min Joon Gook.

199
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:37,100
[Plays the role of Min Joon Gook in
'I Hear Your Voice'.]

200
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:41,660
[Killer extraordinaire, Min Joon Gook.]

201
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:46,070
[Bringing everyone to the edges of their seats
with his frightening and realistic portrayal.]

202
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:50,170
What kind of a character is
Min Joon Gook?

203
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:51,890
- He's a murderer.
- A murderer!

204
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:54,220
A murderer!
He's a murderer!

205
00:10:58,030 --> 00:11:00,270
- I didn't hit you!
- You did hit me!

206
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:01,820
You hit me in both of my ears!

207
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:04,780
You told me that you're a killer
without even a change in your expression!

208
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:08,120
- He's not your average killer either.
- He really is scary.

209
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:11,100
I'm aware that there's a famous line
that your character says in the drama.

210
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,810
What is that saying?
Please tell everyone in this courtroom.

211
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:18,100
"I'm going to kill you if you tell anyone."

212
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,090
I told people earlier...
I told everyone about it earlier.

213
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:24,700
"I'm also going to kill the people
who you told it to."

214
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:27,900
[Let's not hear anything...]

215
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:29,330
- Ji Suk Jin.
- Yes?

216
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:31,220
If you lie, I'm going to kill you.

217
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:34,110
[Ice]

218
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,130
He just said that he's going to kill him!
He said the word 'kill' in the courtroom!

219
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:38,930
Honorable Judge, he was just describing
the character he plays in the drama.

220
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:41,510
Next.

221
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:44,830
Defendant Kim Hee Won.

222
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,430
- Listen to him.
- He really sounds like a prosecutor.

223
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:50,350
He really truly does look like
a psychopath.

224
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:52,490
[What?
He looks like a psychopath?]

225
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:56,700
- Most people that looks like him...
- He's too harsh with his words.

226
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,270
What do you mean,
he looks like a psychopath?

227
00:11:58,270 --> 00:12:00,060
- Actor Kim Hee Won.
- Yes?

228
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:03,300
What do you consider to be the most
famous role you portrayed in a movie?

229
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:06,760
- 'The Man From Nowhere'.
- The movie, 'The Man From Nowhere'?

230
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,060
Ask him which role he thinks
that he's most famous for.

231
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,030
What is role that you portrayed
in the movie, 'The Man From Nowhere'?

232
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:12,720
The character's name was Man Suk.

233
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:18,120
[Played the character named Man Suk, the
villain in the movie, 'The Man From Nowhere'.]

234
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:21,030
What did your character
Man Suk do in the movie?

235
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:22,280
That was a scary character.

236
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:26,300
- The organs...
- Organs!

237
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:31,130
- What did he do with the organs?
- He meant he had an organ.

238
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,900
Organs?
What is it that you did with the organs?

239
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,930
I saw that movie!

240
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:38,380
He keeps badgering the defendants with
irrelevant questions

241
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:40,410
about characters that they played
in movies and dramas.

242
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:43,220
- I object.
- No, I will allow it.

243
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:49,560
Can you please show us the evil expression
your character was known for in the movie?

244
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:52,480
Show us what your character looked like in the
last scene as your younger sibling was dying.

245
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,130
You can re-act the scene for us by
using my name for the scene.

246
00:12:57,710 --> 00:13:00,310
But since this is a variety show,
you can't swear in your reenactment.

247
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:01,820
'Ugh... Gary!'

248
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:03,450
Wasn't it something like that?

249
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,490
You're doing great!

250
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:12,520
Hey, Gary!

251
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,830
[The true face of evil.]

252
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:20,720
[Seriously...]

253
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:23,240
I think it was him!

254
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:29,450
- Look at his expression.
- No need to question any further.

255
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:31,170
Honorable Judge.

256
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:33,480
I believe that he is the culprit.

257
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,190
No further questions.

258
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:37,650
- It's the beautiful prosecutor's turn.
- Yes.

259
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:39,450
I will now start my line of questioning.

260
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:40,850
Show them what you've got.

261
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:43,660
The defendant that I will be questioning
is Ahn Gil Kang.

262
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:46,190
[Defendant Number Three, Ahn Gil Kang.]

263
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:48,180
I was hoping that she would be
the one to question me.

264
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:52,020
[Disappointed that he wasn't questioned
by Prosecutor Blank?]

265
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:54,580
[Asking to shake her hand?]

266
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:56,270
Don't shake his hand!

267
00:13:56,870 --> 00:14:01,090
[Evil extraordinaire defendants vying for
the chance to greet the beautiful prosecutor.]

268
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:03,880
[Gil Kang joining in on the parade.]

269
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:04,910
What are you doing?

270
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:09,730
Don't even say hi to me.

271
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,830
Yes, Ahn Gil Kang.

272
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:15,600
What is it that you're most
well-known for?

273
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,970
- Expert in playing evil roles.
- That's correct.

274
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:27,950
[Actor Ahn Gil Kang having played
a variety of evil roles.]

275
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:32,980
And also, from my recollection...

276
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:36,160
you and I worked on the same project
together three years ago.

277
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,840
- What was it?
- What role did he play in the movie?

278
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,910
With that long sword in his hand...

279
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:41,910
he went around slaying people
throughout the movie.

280
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:43,780
What are you talking about right now?

281
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,320
She's just saying that he played
a role like that in one of his movies.

282
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,560
He went around slaying people
as if it was nothing.

283
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:51,530
- He slayed people?
- Yes, he rode around on the horse to do it.

284
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:54,060
- He slayed them like that.
- What do you mean, like that?

285
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:56,340
[A cruel and evil role.]

286
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:58,150
- I can't even look at him right now!
- Stop looking at us like that!

287
00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:01,220
- This is a variety show!
- This is what I do for a living!

288
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:03,020
It is highly likely.

289
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:07,820
It is highly likely that he could've been
the one to hit the defendant in question.

290
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:09,740
[Highly likely that he is the culprit
that hit the defendant in question.]

291
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:13,190
I meant, the plaintiff.
('Plaintiff' sounds like 'One-go'.)

292
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:15,400
Two-go?

293
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:17,140
- Three-go!
- Stop!

294
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:19,590
[Legal terms are so hard...]

295
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,830
- Everyone, please calm down.
- Yes, I understand.

296
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:21,940
Next.

297
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:24,500
Lee Kwang Soo.

298
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,600
[Defendant Number Four,
Lee Kwang Soo.]

299
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:29,350
- This really is unfair.
- This is getting old, Lee Kwang Soo.

300
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:31,590
What is the nickname you've been
dubbed with on Running Man?

301
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:32,680
[Defendant Number Four's nickname?]

302
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,140
Traitorous Giraffe.

303
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:36,530
It's Slanderous Kwang Soo, isn't it?

304
00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:38,050
Yes, I'm also known as
Slanderous Kwang Soo.

305
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:41,030
I remember how you tricked me during
the early days of Running Man.

306
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,760
- Don't you remember?
- What is this line of questioning about?

307
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:49,330
I told you not to say such absurd things!
Song Ji Hyo never caused a scene at the club!

308
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:51,320
That's enough!
I said, that's enough!

309
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,650
Did our Ji Hyo ever do anything
that deserves to have fingers pointed at?

310
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:55,970
I didn't know how much she loved
to go out doing things like that!

311
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:57,890
Ji Hyo quit her smoking!

312
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:01,320
- Please stop slandering her name!
- Congratulations.

313
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:03,530
It was a wise decision that you made
for the sake of your health.

314
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:07,410
[Defense Counsel Yoo hammering the final
nail with his slanderous remark.]

315
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:10,530
- That was a very smart decision you made.
- Hey, hey... please calm down.

316
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:12,740
- Okay then.
- What do you mean, 'hey, hey'?

317
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,460
[Getting everyone to calm down
and stop joking around.]

318
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:20,270
Okay, the prosecution team
may go back to their stand.

319
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:22,740
The defense counsel may now
start his line of questioning.

320
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:26,380
Then I will take a brief moment to
speak to each of the defendants.

321
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:29,300
You're currently in the drama,
'I Hear Your Voice', isn't that right?

322
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:31,260
Yes, I'm currently in that drama.

323
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:35,410
Weren't you in a comedy sitcom before you
took on the role of your current character?

324
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:38,540
I especially seem to remember a character
you played with his famous catch phrase?

325
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:41,180
That famous catch phrase.
Wasn't there one that became quite popular?

326
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:43,840
- What was it? It's been awhile.
- It's been so long since I've heard that.

327
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:45,990
'I think I got it.'

328
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,810
'I think I got it.'

329
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:50,520
[He's still got it.]

330
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,340
- Everyone got a laugh out of that, right?
- No, we didn't.

331
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:54,260
- This is the type of person he is.
- I didn't think that was funny at all.

332
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:57,750
This is the type of character he played
before he started his current drama.

333
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,800
Okay? He brought big laughter
to everyone.

334
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,700
Do you have a special nickname
that you use for your girlfriend?

335
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:06,090
- Do I really have to say it?
- Come on, you can tell us!

336
00:17:06,090 --> 00:17:09,070
- It's okay, you can tell us.
- Look! He can't even say it!

337
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:12,560
- I just call her, 'my baby'.
- 'My baby'?

338
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:14,310
Everyone heard, right?

339
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:17,130
A person who calls his girlfriend
'My baby'...

340
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:21,390
Could someone like that have hit Ji Suk Jin
and sit over there feigning ignorance?

341
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:22,570
Do you think?

342
00:17:22,570 --> 00:17:25,800
- When's the last time you kissed her?
- What kind of a question is that?

343
00:17:25,830 --> 00:17:28,550
Have you done it in the
past week or no?

344
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,640
- You have!
- Or you haven't?

345
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:34,010
You don't have to answer that question.
No need to answer that question.

346
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:38,450
I will now ask the defendant Ahn Gil Kang
one simple question.

347
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,690
[Just looking at him in the face
makes them quake in fear.]

348
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:45,390
Can you please tell us
how old your kids are?

349
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:47,360
They're five and seven years old.

350
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,690
- Five and seven years old?
- Yes.

351
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:51,230
Has your daughter ever said anything to you
when you told her you'd be on this show?

352
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:52,610
Did she tell you what she wanted
you to do on the show?

353
00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:56,240
- No, she didn't say anything specific.
- She probably told you not to hit anyone.

354
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,060
You're being too loud, Mister!

355
00:17:58,060 --> 00:18:00,320
What did you say?
How can you say that?

356
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:03,220
[Gil Kang exploding in anger.]

357
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,640
You guys are being too loud!
Let us talk too!

358
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:10,980
It's a very plausible statement.

359
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:12,630
- That's correct.
- Yes.

360
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:15,280
- Now, Lee Kwang Soo.
- Yes?

361
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:19,900
- Did you ever hit Ji Suk Jin in his ears?
- No, I haven't.

362
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:22,430
We need to check him out further.

363
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:25,120
What are you doing?
We're on the same side.

364
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,960
Okay, Lee Kwang Soo.

365
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,980
Is there anything that you'd like
to say to Ji Suk Jin?

366
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:31,180
No, there isn't.

367
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:32,620
I don't have anything to say either.

368
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:35,260
What are you doing?

369
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:37,330
- Is that all you've got to say?
- I can't help it if you get captured.

370
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:40,220
- Yes, I do have something to say!
- I thought that you didn't!

371
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:42,490
[He doesn't seem to want to be
Giraffe's defense counsel.]

372
00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:46,620
[Defense counsel rests his case?]

373
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:50,050
Honorable Judge.
My defendants feel that this is very unfair.

374
00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:52,800
Just because they've played
evil characters in their movies in the past

375
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,460
they've been framed for this
heinous crimes.

376
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:59,480
But these are very kind men who are being put
through a difficult time from that prejudice.

377
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:04,110
Then, Ji Suk Jin...
I feel that if anything, it's Ji Suk Jin

378
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:05,610
who fabricated this whole scenario.

379
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:09,370
I'm telling you that I really was hit!
What are you talking about right now?

380
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:12,070
Are you doing this to gain more attention?

381
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:13,740
What are you saying to our plaintiff?

382
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:16,250
- You can't doubt our own client!
- He does have a point.

383
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:19,140
I'm positive that I was hit
by someone.

384
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:20,550
Please quiet down.

385
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:27,140
Our country rules trials based on evidence,
and there hasn't been any evidence so far.

386
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:32,440
[We will now start a race to find
evidence to support this case.]

387
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:36,100
[The team that wins each of the game
will gain themselves a piece of evidence.]

388
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:38,380
[If the prosecution team wins, then
the defendants would be found guilty.]

389
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:41,350
[If the defense counsel team wins, then
the defendants will be found innocent.]

390
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,270
We will take a brief recess.

391
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:46,450
Please move on to your next location
for your first evidence gathering game.

392
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:48,110
- Yes, I understand.
- Let's see who wins.

393
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:52,510
[Prosecution Team vs. Defense Team.
Race to gather evidence- Start.]

394
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:54,660
[In moments- The closing arguments.]

395
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:57,440
[Evidence that they never knew existed
will be revealed to tell the true story.]

396
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,420
[A fierce battle between the Prosecution
and the Defense to argue their case.]

397
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:01,990
[Who is the culprit hiding behind
the mask of secrecy?]

398
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:06,820
[Where the 2013 world boat racing
championship will take place.]

399
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:09,270
- What is this?
- What are we going to be doing here?

400
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:11,350
- What is this?
- There's something shiny up there.

401
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:14,650
[What is the meaning of this red line?]

402
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:16,850
It's a little slippery over here.

403
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:22,610
You all know that you are here to play a game
that will give you a clue to the truth?

404
00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:27,400
The first game you'll be playing for evidence
is the human 'Cola and Cider' game.

405
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,780
Human cola and cider game?

406
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:30,130
- Human cola and cider game.
- So we're going to be flung off this thing?

407
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:33,980
For the game we'll be playing now,
do you all see the red line over here?

408
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:37,340
- This red line is the line of truth.
- Okay, so?

409
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:42,000
The team that comes
closest to this line will win

410
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,480
and gain a piece of evidence.

411
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:47,290
- So we're going to be dumped in the water?
- Push too hard, and someone gets dumped?

412
00:20:47,290 --> 00:20:49,810
So this is like a human curling game?

413
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,970
[Human cola and cider game-
The line of truth game- Start.]

414
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:58,360
[The prosecution team getting serious
about planning their game tactics.]

415
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:59,690
How are we supposed to play this?

416
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:04,880
- I think what we're supposed to do is...
- Look at how smiley these guys all are.

417
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,230
Look at the smiles on their faces.

418
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:13,240
[Who can point their fingers at these men
as they see these smiles on their faces?]

419
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:16,760
- Look at the angelic baby smiles!
- They're like baby angels over here.

420
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:19,090
- How are they like baby angels?
- What are you talking about?

421
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:20,720
Don't you mean the angels of evil?

422
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,410
No, baby angels, not evil angels.
Baby angels!

423
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:27,610
Instead of going through all this,
how about you let them all hit you once?

424
00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:29,990
[Just let each of them hit him once
to see if he can recognize the slap?]

425
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:32,240
I think it would be a good idea to let them
hit you once to see who it is.

426
00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:34,660
Do you have any idea how much it hurts?

427
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:37,780
[The team that gets closest
to this line wins!]

428
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,260
[First up for the Defense Team is,
Defendant Jung Woong In.]

429
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:46,180
[The glint in his eye transforms...]

430
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,330
<i>If you tell anyone, I'm going to kill you.</i>

431
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:55,110
[Bringing the dark energy he portrays
in the drama to this game?]

432
00:21:55,930 --> 00:21:57,460
I'm going to get this evidence.

433
00:21:57,850 --> 00:22:01,330
[Woong In flings himself
without any hesitation!]

434
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:06,110
[How close will he get to the
line of truth?]

435
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,370
[Went too far.]

436
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:20,260
Don't fling yourself too hard!
Not that hard!

437
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:23,990
- Seriously!
- Come on.

438
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,920
Get your food bowl.
No, I didn't mean to call that a food bowl.

439
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:29,490
- What do you mean, a food bowl?
- A food bowl of our variety world.

440
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:31,170
A food bowl for our variety world.

441
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:34,660
[Agrees that they can't use their foot as
a brake even if they're about to fall in.]

442
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:36,410
- No use of any brakes, okay?
- No brakes?

443
00:22:36,410 --> 00:22:38,560
[Defense Team's Woong In is disqualified.]

444
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:42,650
[The first person up for the
Prosecution Team is Prosecutor Ha.]

445
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,330
Lift up your feet!
Lift your feet!

446
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:55,320
[A very close call, but he's safe.]

447
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:56,890
You have to stay there just like that.

448
00:22:58,770 --> 00:23:01,880
[Next up for the Defense Team is
Defendant Kim Hee Won.]

449
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:06,270
[Expert in playing the evil roles with his
perfect mix of innocence and devilishness.]

450
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:08,550
You're not too athletic yourself, are you?

451
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:11,620
He's always ordering
others around in his movies.

452
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:13,470
He always has his minions
doing things for him.

453
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,590
Because he can't fight himself.

454
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:20,340
Hee Won doesn't know that hats like these
are usually worn in forests or the like.

455
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:22,360
Those hats are not suitable for
the water.

456
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,940
I really wasn't going to say this,
but I just couldn't help it.

457
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:27,610
Don't babies usually wear hats like this?
I usually see babies wearing them.

458
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:31,340
- Those hats are meant for babies.
- It's not like it's even all that sunny out.

459
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:33,300
I thought that it was going to be
really sunny outside.

460
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:36,900
I can't believe all the teasing he's getting
just because of the hat he's wearing.

461
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,300
Fighting.

462
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:41,790
[Defense Team's second defendant
Hee Won steps up to the challenge.]

463
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:48,250
[Heading in Prosecutor Ha's direction.]

464
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:55,400
[Falls into the water simultaneously.]

465
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:06,170
[Defendant Kim and Prosecutor Ha
are both ousted.]

466
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:09,970
[Struggling in the water with
his kid appropriate hat.]

467
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:15,490
Okay, Hee Won did well.

468
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:17,500
[Even though he fell in the water,
he still ousted a member of the other team.]

469
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:19,180
Move out of my way.

470
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:21,410
Why? Why are you speaking to
me like that?

471
00:24:21,410 --> 00:24:23,810
[Victim Ji speaking with
some edge to his voice.]

472
00:24:23,810 --> 00:24:26,570
What are you talking about?
Just get out of my way!

473
00:24:27,610 --> 00:24:30,250
- I said, move!
- Don't do that. You have to gain sympathy.

474
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:34,020
[How close will Victim Ji
get to the line of truth?]

475
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:37,940
[A good looking start!]

476
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:40,690
There you go!
That looks good!

477
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:43,250
- Okay!
- That's actually the perfect spot.

478
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:47,080
- That's perfect.
- Victim Ji! Victim Ji!

479
00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:50,350
[Defendant Team is formulating their plan
according to where Suk Jin is placed.]

480
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:54,840
To the side is better.
Kwang Soo, get over on his side.

481
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:58,060
[Giraffe from the Defense Team
gets ready to take his turn.]

482
00:24:58,070 --> 00:25:01,330
- Fighting!
- Lee Kwang Soo is making me nervous.

483
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:07,310
[Will he push him out of the way,
or push himself out of the way?]

484
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:09,180
[Huh?]

485
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:13,530
[He's still not fully off?]

486
00:25:13,530 --> 00:25:15,600
- I didn't fall off!
- You have to stay just like that.

487
00:25:17,870 --> 00:25:20,810
[Slanderous Giraffe desperately
holding on with his one right foot.]

488
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:22,930
My foot is still up there.

489
00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:24,690
Seriously... just get up here.

490
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:26,250
We will allow him to get back up there
if he can get up there by using his leg only.

491
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:27,860
If I get up there with the use
of my leg only?

492
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:33,130
[Will he be able to do it?]

493
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:37,320
What are you doing?

494
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:40,600
[Toad Kwang?]

495
00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:44,720
You really are so ugly.
You're so ugly.

496
00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:48,750
[Wow?]

497
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:52,490
[Unbelievable!
He succeeds in pulling himself up!]

498
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,280
Okay, we'll allow that.

499
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:58,090
That's very acceptable
behavior of a criminal.

500
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:01,990
- Let's go!
- Go!

501
00:26:01,990 --> 00:26:04,160
[Prosecutor Gae from
the Prosecution Team takes his turn.]

502
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:16,890
[Attempted to push Kwang Soo into the
water by shoving Suk Jin into him.]

503
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:19,400
[He should've pushed him harder...]

504
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:21,930
I didn't even notice that he
bumped into me.

505
00:26:21,930 --> 00:26:23,820
I thought that I pushed him pretty hard.

506
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:26,370
[Defendant Ahn Gil Kang's turn.]

507
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,770
- He's not very good at that.
- What are all those guys doing?

508
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:39,100
What are you doing?
I thought that you'd be better than that.

509
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:42,390
[His athletic abilities belies his looks.]

510
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:46,390
Who's in first place right now?

511
00:26:46,390 --> 00:26:48,620
- Suk Jin's in first place right now.
- I'm in first place.

512
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:50,560
- For now.
- I'm in second place though!

513
00:26:52,370 --> 00:26:55,020
[Prosecutor Beauty
gears herself up for her turn!]

514
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:08,570
[That's our Ace Ji Hyo!
Takes Kwang Soo into the water with her!]

515
00:27:09,970 --> 00:27:13,390
[And thus, Prosecution Team
is in the lead!]

516
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,690
[Recent events throws both teams into
a state of frenzy to plan their attack.]

517
00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:18,310
I'm going to push hard into you.

518
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,100
[Push me really hard,
and I'll eliminate them all.]

519
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:21,600
Okay, Jae Suk... fighting!

520
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:25,520
[The final runner for the Defense Team,
Attorney Yoo.]

521
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:28,170
[A powerful start with an
enthusiastic cry.]

522
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,910
[The domino effect!]

523
00:27:43,910 --> 00:27:46,680
[A perfect success!]

524
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,570
[See that?]

525
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:52,930
[Defense Team seems to be celebrating
their certain victory.]

526
00:27:52,930 --> 00:27:55,030
- We got this!
- We're going to win this!

527
00:27:56,770 --> 00:27:59,550
[This prosecutor is on fire!
Jong Kook readies himself for his turn.]

528
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:02,460
[Those evil doers...]

529
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:04,960
[In the name of justice,
you will not be forgiven!]

530
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,500
I'm going to do this in the
name of justice.

531
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:11,470
- Okay! Don't worry.
- You have to endure his move.

532
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:17,800
[Prosecuting Team's last runner-
Prosecutor Kkuk.]

533
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:22,280
[Prepare yourself, you evil doers!]

534
00:28:34,610 --> 00:28:39,670
[Hits himself directly into Attorney Yoo
and plunges him into the water.]

535
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:45,150
[But Gil Kang... withstood his attack.]

536
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:48,530
[Defendant Ahn flings himself backwards
to land directly on top of the line.]

537
00:28:48,530 --> 00:28:50,460
That was like a car crash!

538
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:52,630
We did it!
We won the game!

539
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:55,070
[First round of Line of Truth game
is won by the Defense Team!]

540
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,330
I think he purposely made himself
fall backwards like that.

541
00:28:59,330 --> 00:29:01,340
- I think he did that on purpose.
- You're being too loud again. Come on.

542
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:05,370
He did that on purpose, and
made himself fall like that on purpose.

543
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:07,380
He fell only because of
the way he was shoved like that.

544
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:10,840
- He fell because he was shoved.
- Look at his face!

545
00:29:11,730 --> 00:29:15,110
[His face showing signs to back off?]

546
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:17,560
[Since problems are starting to rise,
his evil nature is starting to show itself?]

547
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:19,100
Are you going to call your minions now?

548
00:29:19,330 --> 00:29:22,470
- He doesn't have any minions!
- How about only three people do it this time?

549
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:24,410
Let's stop all this talking and
just get on with the game.

550
00:29:24,410 --> 00:29:26,160
You're flinging water at me.

551
00:29:26,670 --> 00:29:29,820
[A fierce competition between the
two teams.]

552
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:33,760
[Agrees on having only three players
per team for the second round.]

553
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:36,230
- Pick your three criminals.
- Who are you calling criminals?

554
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:39,420
- How about you three?
- Yeah, let's have you three do it.

555
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:42,410
Why are you calling the three of us
culprits when you're on our side?

556
00:29:42,410 --> 00:29:44,580
- No, they're not culprits.
- Do you know what Gil Kang just said?

557
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:46,000
He just agreed to the three
culprits doing it.

558
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:49,110
<i>- Want to?
- Okay, the three culprits can do it.</i>

559
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:54,090
[Is that a self-confession?]

560
00:29:54,090 --> 00:29:55,900
Who are you calling culprits right now?

561
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:57,730
Culprit one, two, three over there.

562
00:29:57,740 --> 00:29:59,330
- Who are you calling culprits?
- We did not do anything wrong.

563
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:00,910
Okay, let's do this.

564
00:30:00,910 --> 00:30:03,220
[Line of Truth, Round Two-
Start.]

565
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:05,710
- Okay, kiddo. Hurry it up!
- Kiddo?

566
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:08,540
- It's better not to go too far out.
- I'm a prosecutor of this country!

567
00:30:09,490 --> 00:30:12,140
A prosecutor?
You're a quality inspector?

568
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:14,430
[Quality inspector?
The word prosecutor also means, inspector.]

569
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:17,530
The fact that we're hanging out with these
culprits alone is just wrong.

570
00:30:17,530 --> 00:30:19,840
[First runner up for the second round
is Prosecutor Ha.]

571
00:30:25,910 --> 00:30:28,490
[This makes it too easy for the
opposing team to shove him out of the way.]

572
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:29,590
You wait right there.

573
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:31,710
- He's telling him to wait?
- You wait right there.

574
00:30:31,710 --> 00:30:33,490
His killer instincts are starting to come out!

575
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,500
[Now that he sees his chance,
his killer instincts are starting to come out?]

576
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:38,080
You just wait right there!

577
00:30:39,850 --> 00:30:42,570
[Gil Kang from
the Defense Team is on the move!]

578
00:30:47,670 --> 00:30:50,830
[Gil Kang eliminates
Prosecutor Ha in leisure.]

579
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:52,700
- He used his shoulder too much!
- What do you mean, his shoulder?

580
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:00,190
[Prosecutor Kkuk is on fire!]

581
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:01,500
He can't use his shoulders like that!

582
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:07,150
[Second runner for the Prosecution Team
is Ace Ji Hyo.]

583
00:31:07,150 --> 00:31:09,340
Isn't that life vest too small for you?

584
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:13,920
[On Prosecutor Kkuk,
the life vest looks like a kiddie size.]

585
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:16,020
Wait, hang on.
Seriously!

586
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:17,320
- What?
- Stop talking about it.

587
00:31:17,330 --> 00:31:19,030
- Okay.
- Seriously.

588
00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:22,230
- What is that? Your school bag?
- It looks adorable on him.

589
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:25,970
It looks way too small on you.

590
00:31:25,970 --> 00:31:27,700
[Of all the vests to pick from,
he picks the smallest one...]

591
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:33,320
[Ace Ji Hyo-
Will she be able to get rid of Gil Kang?]

592
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:35,050
That's a great shove!

593
00:31:40,370 --> 00:31:43,090
[Ji Hyo shoves herself off
of him instead.]

594
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:47,380
[Their trusted Ji Hyo
gets herself eliminated!]

595
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:56,670
[Huh?
What is he doing?]

596
00:31:56,670 --> 00:31:58,620
Don't come back out.
Just stay down there!

597
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:02,720
[And what is he doing now?]

598
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,560
What are you guys doing?

599
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:07,350
[Easy Brothers showing their abilities
in physical gags.]

600
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:10,370
I told you not to come back out.

601
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,710
[Defense Team's Gil Kang staying
firmly put.]

602
00:32:13,630 --> 00:32:16,070
- He's deeply rooted over there.
- Nice.

603
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:18,140
It's my turn now so you can just relax.

604
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:20,720
[Is it really okay for him to just relax?]

605
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:24,860
[Hee Won of the Defense Team
is on the move!]

606
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:26,370
He's so bad at this!

607
00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:29,530
Nice!
Just stay right there!

608
00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:32,680
[Amazing chance!
First and second winner position!]

609
00:32:33,390 --> 00:32:35,410
[Final contestant from
the Prosecution Team is...]

610
00:32:35,410 --> 00:32:38,550
[Fiery Prosecutor Kkuk!]

611
00:32:38,550 --> 00:32:39,700
Why are you going so far back?

612
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,450
[Figuring out the direction
he's going to take.]

613
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:50,860
[I will prosecute in the name of justice!]

614
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:52,980
- In the name of justice!
- I will do this in the name of justice!

615
00:32:58,020 --> 00:33:01,170
[Prosecutor Kkuk on the move!]

616
00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:19,580
[Gil Kang disappearing from their sight!]

617
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:24,140
[Gil Kang is shoved in the water,
but what about Hee Won?]

618
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:33,820
[He survives the attack!]

619
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:39,150
[Shoves Gil Kang even closer to
the red line of truth!]

620
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:41,660
[Evil... no, the smile of a baby angel.]

621
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:45,930
Okay!

622
00:33:45,930 --> 00:33:47,910
[Line of truth game- Defense Team wins again!]

623
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:50,950
[Defense Team wins two pieces of evidence
for having won the game.]

624
00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:55,640
[Defense Team can use one of the evidence to
help their case during the closing argument.]

625
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:58,220
<i>[Next piece of evidence
can be found in 'S' village.]</i>

626
00:33:58,220 --> 00:33:59,960
[Off to the next location in
search of the evidence!]

627
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:07,800
But... the three of you, actually four,
with Kwang Soo included...

628
00:34:08,170 --> 00:34:09,920
You didn't really hit Suk Jin, did you?

629
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,980
He just made that up.

630
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:14,170
I really do think that
Suk Jin just made it up.

631
00:34:14,170 --> 00:34:15,430
Really?

632
00:34:15,430 --> 00:34:17,590
But how did his ears get so red?

633
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:19,150
- That's what I'm saying.
- His ears really were red.

634
00:34:19,150 --> 00:34:21,080
His ears probably turned red
because he was lying about it.

635
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:25,200
I know I mentioned this earlier,
but it's because of the roles you've played.

636
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:30,110
What are you doing?

637
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:33,830
You're a very reckless driver.

638
00:34:35,090 --> 00:34:36,550
- How should we handle this?
- Huh?

639
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:38,180
What do you mean,
how should we handle it?

640
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:40,710
- What are you saying?
- That was a very scary comment.

641
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:41,800
Seriously.

642
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:44,470
I can't believe you're saying that just
because I went over a couple speed bumps.

643
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:48,540
[Silence...]

644
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:52,030
Please talk or say something.
You three are too scary when you're quiet.

645
00:34:52,550 --> 00:34:55,840
- They're most scary when they're laughing.
- Can the three of you say something?

646
00:34:58,890 --> 00:35:02,010
[Choongchu in Choonchung District-
'S' village.]

647

[Defense Team arriving first
in their pursuit for more evidence.]

648
00:35:08,610 --> 00:35:09,990
Please come this way.

649

What is this?

650
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:14,980
- Aren't you the Judge?
- The Judge is now a neighborhood watchman.

651
00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:18,440
Everyone grab a flashlight over there.

652
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:19,800
A flashlight?

653
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,880
[What is the mission that awaits them
that requires the use of a flashlight?]

654
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:27,860
Sitting next to these three guys makes me
think that something big is about to happen.

655
00:35:29,010 --> 00:35:34,620
[Three men with some grand plan
of doing something in the village?]

656
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:37,740
Disguising ourselves...

657
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:41,810
[Just like this?]

658
00:35:41,810 --> 00:35:43,720
Just confess and end this charade.

659
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:46,970
[Prosecution Team without any evidence
finally arrives.]

660
00:35:46,970 --> 00:35:49,070
- If you confess, this will all be over.
- Confess to what?

661
00:35:49,070 --> 00:35:51,870
[ We told you that we didn't do it.]

662
00:35:52,370 --> 00:35:54,310
What are we going to be doing here?

663
00:35:54,810 --> 00:35:56,220
Okay, your next mission.

664
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:59,420
Your next mission is investigation
in the order of your arrival.

665
00:35:59,430 --> 00:36:01,700
[Mission-
Investigation in the order of arrival.]

666
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:04,670
Find the mission relevant location that are
placed throughout the village

667
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:06,000
and clear the mission of that location.

668
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,490
- And come back to this starting line.
- Okay, we got it.

669
00:36:08,490 --> 00:36:09,670
[Pass the mission in the
order of their arrival.]

670
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:12,520
I won first place the last time we played this
when Soo Hyun was guesting on the show.

671
00:36:12,530 --> 00:36:13,990
- Who?
- Me.

672
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,070
It's going to be different today.

673
00:36:16,070 --> 00:36:18,630
Suk Jin is feeling really competitive today.

674
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:22,120
He said that for once in a long time,
he feels he can take on our guests.

675
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:25,620
- These guys over here.
- Don't touch me.

676
00:36:26,530 --> 00:36:28,830
[Upset at Big-nose's challenge?]

677
00:36:29,170 --> 00:36:31,980
Your first mission is-
Put on the workpants.

678
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:34,820
[First round- Put on the workpants.]

679
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:38,990
You'll find that there are workpants hanging
on various hang lines throughout the village.

680
00:36:38,990 --> 00:36:40,640
- Pants like these.
- Yes.

681
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:44,370
You have to put the pants on
without the use of your hands.

682
00:36:44,370 --> 00:36:46,210
- Ah... with our feet?
- Simple, isn't it?

683
00:36:46,210 --> 00:36:47,900
- Yes, it's simple.
- In the order of arrival.

684
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:49,360
I will accept two winners.
Go!

685
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:53,240
[Find the workpants in the village and
put them on without the use of your hands!]

686
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:54,750
These guys are slow!

687
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,380
[Looking all around for workpants.]

688
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:00,760
Here's one!

689
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:04,610
[Jae Suk is the first to find
a pair of workpants!]

690
00:37:04,610 --> 00:37:07,770
[Two pairs of pants on the clothes line.
Kwang Soo takes the other remaining pair.]

691
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:12,220
- I have to get these on quickly.
- Let me help you.

692
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:23,430
[Yoo Hyuk and Giraffe
extremely out of sync.]

693
00:37:24,270 --> 00:37:26,210
Why don't you just turn yourself in?

694
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:31,260
[Prosecutor Ha prompting him to
turn himself in at every chance he gets.]

695
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:33,080
- What are you talking about?
- I know that you hit him.

696
00:37:34,570 --> 00:37:36,680
You need to take your
shoes off before you do that!

697
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:38,800
- You have to take your shoes off first!
- Should I?

698
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,500
Come on, don't you know anything about
playing these games?

699
00:37:41,070 --> 00:37:43,440
How can you even think to
put on those pants with your shoes still on?

700
00:37:45,250 --> 00:37:47,190
- Wow... there they are!
- Those are mine!

701
00:37:48,870 --> 00:37:51,380
[Discovers a clothing line
in someone's front yard.]

702
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:54,030
- Okay.
- I don't think those are pants.

703
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:55,460
- Yes, they are.
- They're pants?

704
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:56,730
Yes, they're pants.

705
00:37:56,730 --> 00:37:58,200
What?
No, they're not pants!

706
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:59,770
No, these aren't pants.

707
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:04,440
[That shirt actually belongs to
the grandmother who lives in that house.]

708
00:38:04,870 --> 00:38:06,840
Ma'am, where are the other pair of pants?

709
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:08,480
Ah... seriously!

710
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:14,920
They're not all pants.

711
00:38:15,630 --> 00:38:17,340
Just like that.
That's good!

712
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:19,190
Got it.
I got it!

713
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:22,500
[Yoo Hyuk somehow manages to
get his pants almost all the way on!]

714
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:23,950
You have to pull them up higher.

715
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:25,740
- Did I get it?
- You got it.

716
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:28,390
[Succeeds in putting the pants on
with Kwang Soo's help.]

717
00:38:28,390 --> 00:38:30,520
- I'm going to get going first.
- What are you talking about?

718
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:33,310
- We're on the same team!
- What if I'm late for helping you?

719
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:35,510
[Yoo Hyuk wanting to abandon his
teammate Giraffe to go off on his own.]

720
00:38:37,410 --> 00:38:38,970
Can't you be more gentle?

721
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,930
- Did we get it?
- Yes, we got it. Just need to pull them up.

722
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:43,680
Pull them up for me with your toes.

723
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:46,280
[Have to be more careful with
the placement of the toes...]

724
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:50,880
[These guys are fighting over
a single pair of pants.]

725
00:38:52,410 --> 00:38:54,170
[Such funny young men.]

726
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:55,660
Want to help each other out?

727
00:38:55,670 --> 00:38:57,450
Can you hike these up for me
with your feet?

728
00:38:57,450 --> 00:38:59,880
I promise that I'll help you after this.

729
00:39:02,970 --> 00:39:03,980
Okay, that's good.

730
00:39:03,990 --> 00:39:05,820
Wow, you're good.
That's good.

731
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:09,030
Thank you, Hee Won.

732
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:11,430
- Thank you, Hee Won.
- What?

733
00:39:12,490 --> 00:39:14,520
Thank you.

734
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:19,830
[Prosecutor Ha pulling a scheme
on the suspect.]

735
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:22,120
Let's go!

736
00:39:23,150 --> 00:39:27,350
[Scary world of variety show where even
villain expertise like Hee Won can be had.]

737
00:39:31,350 --> 00:39:33,200
I'm first!

738
00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:37,490
[Yoo Hyuk is the first to arrive
after having abandoned the Giraffe.]

739
00:39:37,490 --> 00:39:39,480
I'm really good at things like this.

740
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,620
First place!

741
00:39:41,730 --> 00:39:45,000
What are you doing?
You have to get the pants all the way on!

742
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,490
- Your pants aren't properly on!
- Yes, they are!

743
00:39:47,490 --> 00:39:49,940
[Woong In having borrowed the pair
of pants from the elderly grandmother.]

744
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:53,170
You look like the village idiot right now.

745
00:39:53,830 --> 00:39:55,530
I can see your butt right now.

746
00:39:55,530 --> 00:39:58,390
[Woong In is focused on coming in second
since the order of importance in this game.]

747
00:39:58,390 --> 00:39:59,910
Here, I'll help you pull them up.

748
00:39:59,910 --> 00:40:02,750
[Kwang Soo attempting to help
Woong In pull up his pants.]

749
00:40:03,650 --> 00:40:06,590
[Ha Ha tries to seize that moment
to make his way past the finish line.]

750
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:10,670
[By the split of a hair,
Woong In crosses the finish line first.]

751
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:11,960
Okay, second place.

752
00:40:13,090 --> 00:40:16,570
[Woong In happy with his win
like a little boy.]

753
00:40:16,570 --> 00:40:18,240
I was able to win because
Kwang Soo helped.

754
00:40:20,170 --> 00:40:21,220
Seriously.

755
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:24,830
Maybe I really should become a criminal.

756
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:30,430
[Hee Won left all by his lonesome
after being schemed by Ha Ha.]

757
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:35,800
[With his mouth?]

758
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:39,440
This is exhausting.

759
00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:41,390
Just a little bit more.

760
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:47,880
[This it this way...
and try it that way...]

761
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:59,510
[One lonely suspect's attempt
on putting on the pants.]

762
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:03,210
What took you so long?

763
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:05,210
- You already got your pants on?
- Of course!

764
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,600
[You're nothing to be
impressed with.]

765
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:10,760
- You got them over your hips?
- You have to get someone to help you.

766
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:13,160
- Kwang Soo helped me.
- Really?

767
00:41:14,330 --> 00:41:16,360
Hee Won actually helped me
get my pants on.

768
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:18,130
Really?
I got the pants on by myself.

769
00:41:18,130 --> 00:41:19,560
Why did you do it by yourself?

770
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:22,360
We all had to find sharp corners to help pull
the pants up and it was just mess.

771
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:23,890
Why did you do it like that?

772
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:30,530
[Barefooted... village idiot?]

773
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:35,030
What the heck?

774
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:39,560
[Gil Kang running back out of anxiety.]

775
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:42,770
That's so funny.
Gil Kang seriously looks so funny.

776
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:45,100
What is this?
Everyone already got their pants on?

777
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:47,030
Of course, we did.

778
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:49,920
I couldn't get them over my hips.

779
00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:53,040
You look like you've lived
in this village your whole life.

780
00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:56,060
- I couldn't get them over my butt.
- You look like you've always lived here.

781
00:41:57,610 --> 00:42:04,170
[This man... looks like he'll be here
doing this for the rest of his life.]

782
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:10,720
[One appearance on the variety show,
and it looks like he may never get to leave.]

783
00:42:13,450 --> 00:42:17,150
[The awful pair of pants...]

784
00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:20,060
- Hee Won is so nice.
- Then Jae Suk is the only one that succeeded?

785
00:42:20,210 --> 00:42:22,830
[Since we said the first two to arrive wins,
wouldn't it be Jae Suk and Woong In?]

786
00:42:22,830 --> 00:42:24,980
- I said, the first person to arrive.
- It's only one person, right?

787
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:27,360
- I said it was only the first person.
- That's what I thought you said.

788
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:32,200
[What did you say?]

789
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:34,260
That's what I remember you saying.
It's just the first person.

790
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:36,150
[A slip of the tongue on Dong Wan's part
at the beginning of the game.]

791
00:42:36,150 --> 00:42:38,240
- That's what I thought he said.
- That's too bad for you, Woong In.

792
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:40,710
- You lost by the split of a hair.
- It's no fun having two people succeed.

793
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:44,010
You said it was the first two earlier.

794
00:42:44,430 --> 00:42:46,420
- Woong In, it's just the first person.
- I'm the Judge here.

795
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:49,230
- I'm a very honest person.
- Take off that wig, and you're dead.

796
00:42:49,230 --> 00:42:51,260
[Take off that wig, and you're dead!]

797
00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:55,350
There's no need for a second place
winner in this world.

798
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:58,260
Are you going to kill the
first place winner?

799
00:42:58,260 --> 00:43:00,550
So he did find a pair of pants to put on?

800
00:43:00,550 --> 00:43:01,910
He did get those on.

801
00:43:04,930 --> 00:43:06,830
What happened to you, Hee Won?

802
00:43:06,830 --> 00:43:08,600
What happened to you?

803
00:43:09,750 --> 00:43:13,640
[A total hot mess.]

804
00:43:13,650 --> 00:43:16,600
I... helped Ha Ha because
he asked me to help him.

805
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:19,950
- Then he took off as soon as I helped him.
- Of course he would!

806
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:21,900
He's just way too nice.
No way are you the culprit.

807
00:43:21,910 --> 00:43:25,350
I asked Gary to help me on my way
back here, and then he helped me.

808
00:43:25,390 --> 00:43:27,100
And once I helped him,
he just took off on me.

809
00:43:27,930 --> 00:43:30,660
[Quickly learning all the bad traits?]

810
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:34,220
You all have to do it over anyways
except for the first place winner.

811
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:36,350
- Who came in first?
- Jae Suk.

812
00:43:36,350 --> 00:43:39,590
- Again?
- You all need to get up and get back to work.

813
00:43:39,620 --> 00:43:42,100
But why are all the guests sweating
so profusely today?

814
00:43:42,540 --> 00:43:44,310
Are you okay, Hee Won?

815
00:43:45,860 --> 00:43:48,730
[Soaked in sweat.]

816
00:43:48,730 --> 00:43:50,990
- I was so ticked off.
- You almost called your minions, right?

817
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,690
- What are you talking about right now?
- You wanted to call your guys, right?

818
00:43:54,570 --> 00:43:57,330
[But this was just the beginning
of Hee Won's suffering...]

819
00:43:57,330 --> 00:43:59,650
- Okay, your second mission.
- Yes.

820
00:43:59,650 --> 00:44:01,950
Find the table tennis ball from the well.

821
00:44:01,950 --> 00:44:03,430
- Aha!
- How are we going to find them?

822
00:44:03,430 --> 00:44:05,890
You're going to find several wells
throughout the village.

823
00:44:06,190 --> 00:44:08,850
You'll find the table tennis balls
inside the wells.

824
00:44:08,850 --> 00:44:14,660
The person to come back with the plate with
the ball on it on their head wins this round.

825
00:44:14,660 --> 00:44:15,920
The plate with the table tennis ball?

826
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:19,620
You have to come back to the starting line
with the plate balanced on your head.

827
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:22,300
So are you saying that the plate is
with the ball or not?

828
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:25,760
[Explosion of annoyance.]

829
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:28,250
He said it was the first two people
to cross the line earlier.

830
00:44:28,250 --> 00:44:30,960
[Still angry at the mistake
Village Leader Go made earlier.]

831
00:44:31,270 --> 00:44:33,630
Can Hee Won even handle going
back out there?

832
00:44:34,230 --> 00:44:36,420
[Not sure...]

833
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:41,810
[Barefoot runner Gil Kang also
looks like he's bathed in his own sweat?]

834
00:44:41,810 --> 00:44:43,830
I wonder if it's because I'm wearing
this long sleeved shirt?

835
00:44:43,830 --> 00:44:46,600
This time, it's the first two people
to cross the finish line.

836
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:49,080
Two people, two people.
It's definitely the first two people.

837
00:44:50,330 --> 00:44:52,160
- This is seriously...
- He says it's two people this time.

838
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:55,320
I heard him.

839
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:58,010
- Go!
- I'm going to stick close to Hee Won.

840
00:44:58,020 --> 00:45:00,350
[Table tennis ball delivery- Start!]

841
00:45:00,350 --> 00:45:01,800
Hee Won!
I want to help Hee Won.

842
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:03,590
It's the first two to cross
the finish line.

843
00:45:04,710 --> 00:45:07,650
[In the lead are Kkuk and the Giraffe.]

844
00:45:08,390 --> 00:45:10,880
[There's a well right here!]

845
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:13,940
[Passes right on by...]

846
00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:16,030
You're really good at finding
things like that.

847
00:45:17,610 --> 00:45:22,320
[Everyone working hard to find a well.]

848
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:23,360
I doubt they would've made
it too easy.

849
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,220
Isn't that a well up there?

850
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:29,860
[Kkuk and Giraffe discovers a well!]

851
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:36,780
[A ghost in the well!]

852
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:42,360
[Scared out of their wits.]

853
00:45:45,110 --> 00:45:47,250
[Shot in the face with
the water out of nowhere!]

854
00:45:47,250 --> 00:45:48,700
He said it's a dud.

855
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:53,440
[A ghost in the well
instead of a tennis table ball!]

856
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:02,000
[Woong In and Gil Kang also
shot with the water by the ghost!]

857
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:07,900
[A refreshing shower for Blank Ji as well.]

858
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:09,430
Give me my ball.

859
00:46:10,060 --> 00:46:11,570
Give me my ball!

860
00:46:12,380 --> 00:46:13,500
There it is!

861
00:46:14,510 --> 00:46:17,270
[What will he find in this well?]

862
00:46:17,270 --> 00:46:19,050
What is this!

863
00:46:19,090 --> 00:46:20,420
What's going on here?

864
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:23,760
[A real well with the balls inside!]

865
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:28,000
[Carefully placing it on top of his head.]

866
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:33,870
[Will he make it back sometime today?]

867
00:46:33,870 --> 00:46:35,180
Potatoes?

868
00:46:35,180 --> 00:46:37,290
In the middle of the night like this?
Thank you so much.

869
00:46:37,290 --> 00:46:39,880
[Village elder kindly bringing them an
evening snack of potatoes and watermelon.]

870
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:42,880
Wow... look at all these
potatoes and watermelon!

871
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:44,530
[Such a kind gesture by the elder!]

872
00:46:44,530 --> 00:46:46,950
I'm giving it to you since you're the first
place winner, so enjoy.

873
00:46:46,950 --> 00:46:49,240
- Yes, I will enjoy.
- You have to finish it, okay?

874
00:46:52,420 --> 00:46:56,180
[Why act like he's the one being generous
when he wasn't even the one who brought it?]

875
00:46:56,590 --> 00:46:58,700
What are you talking about?
I can't eat all this.

876
00:46:59,420 --> 00:47:02,930
[Watermelon tasting as sweet as honey.]

877
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:07,210
[Hee Won cautiously heading back
with the ball balanced on top of his head.]

878
00:47:07,210 --> 00:47:08,760
Are you heading back, Hee Won?

879
00:47:09,630 --> 00:47:12,630
[Haroro having too much fun
teasing Hee Won.]

880
00:47:14,250 --> 00:47:15,720
Get away from me!

881
00:47:16,850 --> 00:47:19,990
[Rule- If the ball is dropped on the ground,
have to go back to the well and start over.]

882
00:47:20,430 --> 00:47:22,670
[Trying to calm down and start over.]

883
00:47:22,670 --> 00:47:23,940
Where are you going, Hee Won?

884
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:27,790
- Where are you going, Hee Won?
- Just get away from me!

885
00:47:27,790 --> 00:47:29,510
It's the first two to cross the line.

886
00:47:29,510 --> 00:47:31,810
I just need to make sure that
you're not one of them.

887
00:47:32,580 --> 00:47:34,420
As long as it's not you... okay!

888
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:39,980
[Ro-Ro running away with
Hee Won's ball in hand.]

889
00:47:40,950 --> 00:47:43,930
You have to give me back the ball.

890
00:47:44,270 --> 00:47:46,550
Why do you keep bothering me?
Stop doing that.

891
00:47:47,220 --> 00:47:50,730
I'll allow it if you make me drop the ball
without touching me in any way.

892
00:47:50,730 --> 00:47:53,880
- Okay.
- But you can't touch me anymore.

893
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:56,740
- Okay. Shiny light in your eyes!
- You can't touch me though.

894
00:47:56,740 --> 00:47:59,130
You can't touch me.

895
00:47:59,130 --> 00:48:00,600
You just can't touch me.

896
00:48:01,950 --> 00:48:05,280
Why don't you find yourself your own plate
and do the mission yourself?

897
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:07,500
- Hang on a minute.
- I'm not going to drop this.

898
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:08,880
- Really?
- Of course.

899
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:12,460
- I just can't touch your neck, right?
- No, you can't do that!

900
00:48:13,220 --> 00:48:14,610
That's a really cheap shot.

901
00:48:14,610 --> 00:48:16,570
Why are you doing this to me?

902
00:48:22,830 --> 00:48:24,980
[These two attached together at the hip
right up to the finish line.]

903
00:48:25,260 --> 00:48:28,960
[Oh no!
With the finish line right in front of him!]

904
00:48:30,180 --> 00:48:31,300
Hee Won!

905
00:48:32,470 --> 00:48:34,850
Hee Won, we've got watermelon over here!
Come on!

906
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:42,120
- You touched me!
- He's too nice to be in a variety show.

907
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:43,310
[Hee Won too nice to be on a
variety show?]

908
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:48,700
[Ha Ha trying to block Gil Kang this time?]

909
00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:50,520
- Ha Ha... I love you.
- Hello.

910
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:51,640
I love you too, Gil Kang.

911
00:48:51,700 --> 00:48:54,320
- Let me go just this once.
- Let you go just this once?

912
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:57,000
I love you, Gil Kang!

913
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,680
I love you so much, Gil Kang!

914
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:02,570
[Gil Kang ultimately drops his ball.]

915
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:05,950
- Where?
- Hurry up, Ji Hyo!

916
00:49:05,950 --> 00:49:07,910
[Blank Ji taking the lead after
Gil Kang drops his ball.]

917
00:49:09,390 --> 00:49:11,360
You dropped your ball!

918
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:13,890
I'm sorry, Gil Kang!

919
00:49:14,230 --> 00:49:15,640
I'm sorry, Gil Kang!

920
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:19,140
[Throwing the ball far off into
the distance somewhere.]

921
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:21,650
There's a dog over that way!

922
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,460
[Gary is somehow almost to
the finish line already!]

923
00:49:25,460 --> 00:49:26,610
I'm almost there.

924
00:49:27,530 --> 00:49:28,800
Almost made it.

925
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:32,300
I did it!

926
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:34,760
[Round two- Gary is the first
to get across the finish line!]

927
00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:37,790
My arms are killing me!

928
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:41,780
[Only one spot left for the winner-
Hee Won and Blank Ji walking together.]

929
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:45,340
You still haven't made it to the finish line
even though you found the ball a while ago?

930
00:49:45,340 --> 00:49:48,520
- I almost did make it there.
- But you dropped the ball?

931
00:49:50,090 --> 00:49:51,560
Seriously.

932
00:49:52,650 --> 00:49:54,770
You're not a very nice person.

933
00:49:54,770 --> 00:49:58,240
- You're doing the same thing as I am.
- You're not a very nice person.

934
00:49:58,710 --> 00:50:01,890
- Since I was here already...
- Hurry up, Ji Hyo!

935
00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:03,220
[Only one spot left for the winner!]

936
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:11,590
[Hee Won drops his ball
right in front of the finish line!]

937
00:50:12,570 --> 00:50:15,080
[How can this...]

938
00:50:15,490 --> 00:50:18,870
- You still have a chance! Hurry!
- Two people already made it in.

939
00:50:18,870 --> 00:50:20,860
[Gary and Blank Ji are the
two winners of this round.]

940
00:50:23,650 --> 00:50:25,830
I can't believe that happened.

941
00:50:30,870 --> 00:50:32,670
- What's wrong with you?
- Hee Won, are you crying?

942
00:50:32,670 --> 00:50:34,960
- Are you crying?
- It's not my physical condition...

943
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:36,670
Are you crying?
What's wrong with you?

944
00:50:36,670 --> 00:50:39,190
- It really isn't about my physical condition.
- Then what is it?

945
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:41,960
[Just what is it about?]

946
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:44,230
Tell us what you're upset about.

947
00:50:44,670 --> 00:50:46,970
Why is he only bothering me?

948
00:50:48,340 --> 00:50:51,870
[Nice Hee Won whom others can't help
but want to bother and interfere with.]

949
00:50:51,870 --> 00:50:55,420
You kept tickling me and made me drop
the ball like three times.

950
00:50:55,420 --> 00:50:58,500
I was just trying to show you how
much I like you. It wasn't done on purpose.

951
00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:00,080
We just met for the first time today.

952
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:05,290
- What number am I?
- Is this all sweat?

953
00:51:05,290 --> 00:51:07,170
[Woong In seen walking towards them
unaware of there already being winners.]

954
00:51:07,170 --> 00:51:08,710
- What?
- It's already over.

955
00:51:09,370 --> 00:51:12,260
- That's a lie.
- Don't  you see the people sitting here?

956
00:51:13,990 --> 00:51:16,120
Don't you see everyone here?
Look at how many are here already.

957
00:51:18,050 --> 00:51:19,480
I finally got the feel for it.

958
00:51:22,090 --> 00:51:24,490
- You finally got it?
- Where did that come from?

959
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:26,670
- I said, I saw the potatoes.
- Ah, the potatoes?

960
00:51:26,670 --> 00:51:30,050
[A play on words between 'potato'
and 'got the feel for it'.]

961
00:51:32,060 --> 00:51:35,450
[Gil Kang having avoided the dog
and making it to the finish line.]

962
00:51:37,980 --> 00:51:43,090
[Why are all the villains acting
so cute today?]

963
00:51:43,090 --> 00:51:45,150
It's all over, so just hurry down here.

964
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:47,480
- We won, Jong Kook.
- Really?

965
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:49,940
[Monday Couple wins the second round.]

966
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:52,810
Woong In, Gil Kang, and Hee Won...
we have to win the next round.

967
00:51:52,810 --> 00:51:54,530
If we lose again, then it's all over.

968
00:51:54,530 --> 00:51:56,540
Okay, the third round is...

969
00:51:56,540 --> 00:51:58,320
Speed corn eating.

970
00:51:58,320 --> 00:52:00,800
- I really love corn!
- Me too!

971
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:02,280
Then you can go in my place.

972
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:04,900
[Hee Won exhausted after two rounds?]

973
00:52:04,900 --> 00:52:10,760
You need to finish eating the corn,
and come cross the line with the cob.

974
00:52:10,770 --> 00:52:12,250
This one is very easy.

975
00:52:12,250 --> 00:52:14,640
It doesn't count if you come back without
the cob even if you finish the corn?

976
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:17,820
Why are you so crooked in
the way you think?

977
00:52:19,490 --> 00:52:21,910
- You have to hold onto it.
- Since there are more of us...

978
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:28,860
[Hee Won's simple way of saying things.]

979
00:52:28,860 --> 00:52:31,990
Since there's more of us,
let's each take one of them down.

980
00:52:33,010 --> 00:52:35,070
Then why don't you take Jong Kook?

981
00:52:35,780 --> 00:52:37,520
Let's just forget it then.

982
00:52:39,060 --> 00:52:40,200
Why is it always me?

983
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:42,330
I'm too scared of Jong Kook.

984
00:52:43,410 --> 00:52:44,700
Hee Won.

985
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:46,910
First two to cross the finish line!
Go!

986
00:52:46,910 --> 00:52:49,910
[Corn speed eating- Go!]

987
00:52:50,870 --> 00:52:52,860
[Where is the corn?]

988
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:00,690
[Nice and warm corn on the cob.]

989
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:09,720
[Mowing down on the corn.]

990
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:12,690
Hold him back!

991
00:53:12,690 --> 00:53:14,360
There are only two up here.

992
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:17,920
[Members starting to feel the pressure.]

993
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:24,810
[Gil Kang discovers the corn.]

994
00:53:24,820 --> 00:53:27,170
[Eating the corn at top speed!]

995
00:53:36,430 --> 00:53:38,840
[Ha Ha trying to interfere with
Hee Won again.]

996
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:40,450
I'm going to beat you.

997
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:46,840
[Another love/hate couple over here.]

998
00:53:48,410 --> 00:53:51,650
[Almost finished with the corn.]

999
00:53:54,110 --> 00:53:56,330
[Village idiot brothers.]

1000
00:53:57,640 --> 00:54:01,840
[Rushing back to the finish line
with each other's corn cob in hand.]

1001
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:07,780
[They both crossed the finish line...]

1002
00:54:08,450 --> 00:54:09,930
[I wonder if it was good corn.]

1003
00:54:09,940 --> 00:54:11,790
This one is Jong Kook, and that's mine.

1004
00:54:12,410 --> 00:54:14,340
Don't even joke!
I brought this one.

1005
00:54:15,470 --> 00:54:18,200
[Checking out Kwang Soo's corn cob first.]

1006
00:54:20,900 --> 00:54:24,070
[Hm...
there are still bits of some kernels left.]

1007
00:54:24,070 --> 00:54:25,230
Disqualified!

1008
00:54:25,230 --> 00:54:27,020
[Kwang Soo fails.]

1009
00:54:28,290 --> 00:54:30,940
[Time to check Kkuk's corn cob next.]

1010
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:42,130
[You're dead!]

1011
00:54:42,130 --> 00:54:43,530
Fail!

1012
00:54:43,990 --> 00:54:48,240
There are guys like them every summer causing
trouble when they can't fall asleep.

1013
00:54:50,530 --> 00:54:52,530
Pick up your cob.

1014
00:54:53,970 --> 00:54:56,680
[Out of breath Gil Kang also arrives.]

1015
00:54:59,940 --> 00:55:02,310
- I see a kernel!
- Fail!

1016
00:55:02,310 --> 00:55:04,250
[One kernel left on the cob.]

1017
00:55:05,070 --> 00:55:07,880
[Ah... unfortunately fails.]

1018
00:55:07,890 --> 00:55:10,580
It's not easy to get with my braces.

1019
00:55:12,130 --> 00:55:13,570
You have to eat it clean.

1020
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:20,470
[Kkuk's desperate attempts.]

1021
00:55:21,310 --> 00:55:23,960
Make your escape!

1022
00:55:23,970 --> 00:55:26,310
[Prosecutor Kkuk not allowing
Woong In to get through.]

1023
00:55:26,660 --> 00:55:29,010
Go!
Go, Gil Kang!

1024
00:55:29,850 --> 00:55:32,580
[Woong In passing off his cob
off to Gil Kang!]

1025
00:55:33,940 --> 00:55:36,610
[Go!
Run off to the finish line!]

1026
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:43,070
[I will protect your empty cob!]

1027
00:55:43,070 --> 00:55:46,240
[Gil Kang...]

1028
00:55:51,070 --> 00:55:54,200
[Gil Kang passing the cob back
to Woong In.]

1029
00:55:56,440 --> 00:55:58,830
[Thanks, Gil Kang.]

1030
00:56:00,540 --> 00:56:02,820
[Wait, that is?]

1031
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:05,290
No, that's just...

1032
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:09,860
It's all done!
That's nothing but a...

1033
00:56:11,140 --> 00:56:12,190
Fail.

1034
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:16,880
You have to eat it clean.

1035
00:56:17,570 --> 00:56:19,040
Please save me.

1036
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:20,610
I can't do this again!

1037
00:56:23,630 --> 00:56:26,870
[The Traitors' Club all rushing in
together at this time.]

1038
00:56:29,990 --> 00:56:31,330
I have to check out your cob.

1039
00:56:31,330 --> 00:56:33,930
[Ha Ha's cob to be checked out first.]

1040
00:56:33,930 --> 00:56:36,420
You ate way too much.
I told you to only eat half.

1041
00:56:36,510 --> 00:56:37,790
Fail!

1042
00:56:37,790 --> 00:56:39,870
[Ha Ha fails from being
too greedy with this corn.]

1043
00:56:39,870 --> 00:56:41,910
- Please give me a break.
- Fail.

1044
00:56:42,220 --> 00:56:45,000
[Next up is Big-nosed Brother.]

1045
00:56:47,580 --> 00:56:49,300
It's clean.
Success.

1046
00:56:49,300 --> 00:56:51,610
[Big-nose from the
Prosecution Team passes.]

1047
00:56:52,950 --> 00:56:55,570
[Hee Won coming towards the finish line.]

1048
00:57:00,040 --> 00:57:02,450
[Ha Ha intercepts Hee Won's cob,
and gets rid of it.]

1049
00:57:03,450 --> 00:57:06,390
[Please...]

1050
00:57:08,650 --> 00:57:11,620
[Having to turn back around
at the finish line...]

1051
00:57:11,630 --> 00:57:13,880
Why did you let him take
that from you?

1052
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:15,640
[Please just leave me alone...]

1053
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:22,040
[Ha Ha returning his cob back to him.]

1054
00:57:22,870 --> 00:57:25,310
[Unable to stop himself from
teasing Hee Won.]

1055
00:57:26,820 --> 00:57:29,770
[You scoundrel!]

1056
00:57:35,730 --> 00:57:37,290
It's clean.
Success.

1057
00:57:38,070 --> 00:57:39,460
He succeeded?

1058
00:57:40,060 --> 00:57:43,080
[Nice Hee Won finally succeeds
after all his difficulties.]

1059
00:57:44,340 --> 00:57:45,490
Is it over then?

1060
00:57:46,420 --> 00:57:48,480
You're going to have to
work out some more, Hee Won.

1061
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:50,220
You really are going to have to
start working out.

1062
00:57:50,230 --> 00:57:52,460
Look at how fit I am.

1063
00:57:52,460 --> 00:57:55,870
- Why are you looking so exhausted?
- But you didn't run around that much.

1064
00:57:55,870 --> 00:57:57,590
What do you mean, I didn't run enough?
I've been running around all day.

1065
00:57:57,590 --> 00:57:59,500
You haven't been running much today.

1066
00:57:59,510 --> 00:58:01,910
Suk Jin's never talked to
anyone like that before.

1067
00:58:01,910 --> 00:58:03,720
You really should start working out.

1068
00:58:04,990 --> 00:58:06,210
Want to have a wrestling match?

1069
00:58:06,680 --> 00:58:08,770
[Big-nosed Brother's challenge.]

1070
00:58:09,460 --> 00:58:11,500
- That would be interesting.
- Let's try arm wrestling.

1071
00:58:11,500 --> 00:58:12,940
Okay, let's do it.

1072
00:58:17,870 --> 00:58:19,590
[Okay, let's do this!]

1073
00:58:21,660 --> 00:58:25,110
[Big-nose continuing to act like a brat.]

1074
00:58:27,970 --> 00:58:30,830
- Even Suk Jin has a day like this?
- Suk Jin, seriously.

1075
00:58:30,830 --> 00:58:34,250
[First time seeing Suk Jin looking
so confidant and cocky like this.]

1076
00:58:34,250 --> 00:58:36,280
I guess he thinks I'm that
easy of a prey.

1077
00:58:37,020 --> 00:58:38,360
I've never seen Suk Jin like this.

1078
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:40,260
This is the first time I've seen him act
so confidant like this against a man.

1079
00:58:40,260 --> 00:58:43,650
[The battle between the two men
with their pride on the line.]

1080
00:58:43,650 --> 00:58:45,250
Suk Jin, you have to make
the first attack.

1081
00:58:45,250 --> 00:58:47,230
- Are you right handed or left handed?
- Me?

1082
00:58:47,230 --> 00:58:49,160
I'll let you know after we do this.

1083
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:52,380
[Hee Won waiting until after
the match to tell him.]

1084
00:58:52,390 --> 00:58:54,880
- You have to tell us which hand you use.
- Why is that important?

1085
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:56,980
That's my choice.

1086
00:58:59,820 --> 00:59:01,860
You can do this, Hee Won.

1087
00:59:01,860 --> 00:59:03,760
If your elbow falls off the table,
you're out.

1088
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:06,380
Wait, he already has his wrist bent.

1089
00:59:06,710 --> 00:59:09,750
[The two men acting very sensitive
before the match even starts.]

1090
00:59:09,750 --> 00:59:11,810
You have to loosen up.
Both of you need to relax your grip.

1091
00:59:11,820 --> 00:59:15,080
[Just who will be dubbed
as the weakest member?]

1092
00:59:15,940 --> 00:59:18,000
[Big-nosed Suk Jin vs. Nice Hee Won-
Arm wrestle battle!]

1093
00:59:21,970 --> 00:59:23,910
- What's going on?
- Seriously?

1094
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:33,580
[Big-nose wins!]

1095
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:36,810
[My goodness...]

1096
00:59:36,820 --> 00:59:39,060
[How can this be?]

1097
00:59:40,170 --> 00:59:43,390
[Today is just...]

1098
00:59:44,330 --> 00:59:45,440
[Celebration ceremony.]

1099
00:59:45,450 --> 00:59:47,010
Ahn Gil Kang, come out here.

1100
00:59:47,690 --> 00:59:49,060
Come out here, Ahn Gil Kang.

1101
00:59:51,110 --> 00:59:53,350
[Cocky Big-nosed Brother's challenge.]

1102
00:59:53,350 --> 00:59:55,380
- That's enough!
- Are you okay, Hee Won?

1103
00:59:57,370 --> 00:59:59,460
It's okay, it's no big deal.

1104
00:59:59,460 --> 01:00:02,320
- It's no big deal that you lost.
- I'm left handed.

1105
01:00:02,320 --> 01:00:04,590
He always loses to even the girls!

1106
01:00:04,590 --> 01:00:06,500
[But to lose to Big-nose...]

1107
01:00:06,500 --> 01:00:08,090
I even lost to Minzy.

1108
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:11,670
Hee Won,
Ji Hyo's waiting for her turn.

1109
01:00:12,120 --> 01:00:13,800
Hee Won,
Ji Hyo's waiting for her turn.

1110
01:00:14,870 --> 01:00:17,880
[Big-nosed Suk Jin vs. Nice Hee Won-
Round two.]

1111
01:00:18,670 --> 01:00:19,870
Okay, then let's do it that way.

1112
01:00:19,870 --> 01:00:23,010
[No more excuses to give
if he loses this round too.]

1113
01:00:23,010 --> 01:00:24,510
If Hee Won loses this round too...

1114
01:00:25,160 --> 01:00:26,990
- This is really uncomfortable though.
- Relax your grip.

1115
01:00:28,360 --> 01:00:30,890
- I should sit like this.
- You can't do that.

1116
01:00:31,170 --> 01:00:33,660
[Extremely sensitive.]

1117
01:00:33,660 --> 01:00:35,620
- He's not doing anything wrong.
- Okay, ready...

1118
01:00:35,620 --> 01:00:37,790
- Relax.
- One, two...

1119
01:00:37,790 --> 01:00:39,780
[Round two-
Left handed arm wrestling.]

1120
01:00:41,650 --> 01:00:45,460
[How will it end this time?]

1121
01:00:53,430 --> 01:00:55,090
[Oh my goodness...]

1122
01:00:55,090 --> 01:00:57,880
[There's your answer.]

1123
01:00:57,880 --> 01:01:00,010
- He really is a strange one.
- What are we going to do about this?

1124
01:01:00,010 --> 01:01:03,080
- Stop making him do this now.
- Why did you make me do that?

1125
01:01:04,110 --> 01:01:07,160
- I just thought it would be fun.
- It's just because you're tired right now.

1126
01:01:07,160 --> 01:01:08,310
Yes, you're right.

1127
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:10,400
Look at how sweaty I am right now.

1128
01:01:12,340 --> 01:01:15,400
- How about your lower body then?
- How about leg wrestling?

1129
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:18,160
- You still have both your legs.
- Stop torturing him!

1130
01:01:19,820 --> 01:01:22,270
[Even the spectators don't know
how to react to the results.]

1131
01:01:22,270 --> 01:01:24,280
I don't think you're going to be able to
play anymore villainous roles.

1132
01:01:24,940 --> 01:01:27,440
[A damaging effect on his career?]

1133
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:29,550
I don't think you're going to get anymore
offers on villain roles.

1134
01:01:29,550 --> 01:01:32,180
[We'll wait for your new,
kind character roles.]

1135
01:01:32,180 --> 01:01:34,680
- Winning isn't what's important.
- Let's just move on to the next game.

1136
01:01:34,680 --> 01:01:36,760
This wasn't part of the plan anyway.

1137
01:01:38,090 --> 01:01:39,850
I didn't know it was going to be like this.

1138
01:01:39,850 --> 01:01:41,610
Let's just move on to our next game.

1139
01:01:42,840 --> 01:01:45,010
- Didn't you pass the last game?
- Yes, you did.

1140
01:01:45,010 --> 01:01:46,490
That's right, I did pass!

1141
01:01:47,770 --> 01:01:50,040
[Losing his train of thought after
the arm wrestling match.]

1142
01:01:50,040 --> 01:01:52,690
[Everyone enthralled with
Hee Won's charming personality.]

1143
01:01:52,700 --> 01:01:54,500
He's so adorable.

1144
01:01:55,750 --> 01:01:58,760
[Kim Hee Won is now known for his cuteness
whom everyone wants to keep in their pockets.]

1145
01:02:00,320 --> 01:02:02,600
Your next mission is, fireworks mission.

1146
01:02:02,600 --> 01:02:04,750
[Fourth round- Fireworks mission.]

1147
01:02:04,750 --> 01:02:08,280
[Find the firecracker inside the
cake boxes.]

1148
01:02:08,280 --> 01:02:11,660
[Must return to the finish line
before the fire cracker goes out.]

1149
01:02:11,660 --> 01:02:13,290
Three people will succeed
in the order of their arrival.

1150
01:02:15,120 --> 01:02:16,730
Okay, okay.
Sorry.

1151
01:02:21,390 --> 01:02:23,470
[Ha Ha discovers a cake box!]

1152
01:02:24,010 --> 01:02:27,810
[Must return back to the starting line
before the fire cracker goes out!]

1153
01:02:28,060 --> 01:02:29,310
Where is it?

1154
01:02:30,690 --> 01:02:31,850
Is it this way?

1155
01:02:34,510 --> 01:02:38,940
[Gil Kang also heads on his way
after lighting up his firecracker.]

1156
01:02:43,450 --> 01:02:45,630
[Back at the finish line...]

1157
01:02:46,580 --> 01:02:49,780
[Hee Won wringing out his towel that's
been wet by the ice water.]

1158
01:02:52,490 --> 01:02:55,320
I bet my arms got all weak earlier
from wringing out my towel.

1159
01:02:58,630 --> 01:03:00,970
I've been wringing out my
towel all night.

1160
01:03:00,970 --> 01:03:03,380
- You're right.
- So that's why?

1161
01:03:03,380 --> 01:03:06,270
It takes a lot of strength
to wring out the towel like this.

1162
01:03:09,950 --> 01:03:12,340
[Ha Ha just needs to round this corner
to get to the finish line!]

1163
01:03:14,230 --> 01:03:15,350
No!

1164
01:03:17,790 --> 01:03:19,560
[Oh no! The firecracker went out!]

1165
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:22,680
- Did it go out, Ha Ha?
- My firecracker went out.

1166
01:03:22,680 --> 01:03:24,590
- Okay, it's off!
- If it's out, then you have to go back.

1167
01:03:24,590 --> 01:03:26,530
- You have to go back then.
- You have to go back and get a new one.

1168
01:03:26,530 --> 01:03:27,950
Just get lost.

1169
01:03:31,050 --> 01:03:34,100
[Succeeds in getting his
petty revenge against Ha Ha.]

1170
01:03:35,610 --> 01:03:37,510
[Pocket-man, Hee Won.]

1171
01:03:37,510 --> 01:03:39,760
- He's so adorable.
- You have to hurry with that firecracker.

1172
01:03:40,420 --> 01:03:42,260
He's the nation's cutie mascot.

1173
01:03:43,810 --> 01:03:47,250
[Gil Kang's firecracker is still lit!]

1174
01:03:49,950 --> 01:03:52,890
[Ahn Gil Kang is the first
to cross the finish line!]

1175
01:03:52,890 --> 01:03:56,300
[By the split of a hair! The fire goes out
as soon as he crosses the line.]

1176
01:03:58,860 --> 01:04:01,100
[Complete exhaustion.]

1177
01:04:01,110 --> 01:04:04,260
Then our team is still missing
Kwang Soo...

1178
01:04:04,770 --> 01:04:06,430
- And Woong In.
- Woong In.

1179
01:04:06,430 --> 01:04:09,990
[Defendants' Team- Woong In and Kwang Soo
vs. Prosecution Team's Jong Kook and Ha Ha.]

1180
01:04:10,730 --> 01:04:15,310
[Defendant's Team has
Jong Kook surrounded.]

1181
01:04:15,310 --> 01:04:16,610
- Let me at least light it up.
- Sure, go ahead.

1182
01:04:16,610 --> 01:04:18,690
- Sure, light it and go.
- Let me light it up at least.

1183
01:04:19,700 --> 01:04:22,140
[Standing ready with
the water bottle in hand.]

1184
01:04:23,100 --> 01:04:26,030
[Kkuk unable to light up his match.]

1185
01:04:27,140 --> 01:04:29,170
You have to make sure to
stick close to him.

1186
01:04:29,170 --> 01:04:31,320
Here's another one in there.

1187
01:04:32,570 --> 01:04:35,130
[Woong In looking inside the cake box
in case another one can be found.]

1188
01:04:36,740 --> 01:04:38,750
[A lighter in the corner of the box
that Kkuk missed seeing!]

1189
01:04:40,510 --> 01:04:44,200
[Woong In secretly lights up his firecracker
and is on his way!]

1190
01:04:46,660 --> 01:04:49,550
[Ha Ha is also sprinting off
to the finish line!]

1191
01:04:51,570 --> 01:04:52,490
Is someone coming?

1192
01:04:53,820 --> 01:04:55,040
Who is it?
Is it Woong In?

1193
01:04:55,040 --> 01:04:57,700
[Woong In is the first to arrive
with the lighted firecracker in hand!]

1194
01:04:58,890 --> 01:05:00,440
We won.

1195
01:05:00,440 --> 01:05:02,070
[Succeeds the mission.]

1196
01:05:02,070 --> 01:05:05,000
- Did all your teammates make it in?
- No, there's still Kwang Soo.

1197
01:05:05,630 --> 01:05:08,380
[Ha Ha crosses the finish line
soon thereafter.]

1198
01:05:09,840 --> 01:05:13,590
[First three to cross the finish line-
Gil Kang, Woong In, and Ha Ha.]

1199
01:05:13,590 --> 01:05:16,150
- So there's only those two left?
- It feels good to have beat Jong Kook.

1200
01:05:17,910 --> 01:05:19,820
A friend of mine told me to make sure
that I beat Jong Kook at something.

1201
01:05:19,820 --> 01:05:22,400
Jong Kook's really bad at
games like these.

1202
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:23,560
- Really?
- Yes.

1203
01:05:24,150 --> 01:05:26,240
That doesn't make me feel very
good to hear that.

1204
01:05:27,970 --> 01:05:31,990
But I think that the last competition
is going to be a very dirty fight.

1205
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:33,600
[Last round-
The dirtiest round thus far?]

1206
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:38,270
[Tiger and the Giraffe about to show
the true meaning of a dirty, bloody fight.]

1207
01:05:38,270 --> 01:05:39,750
Hurry up and tell us what
the next mission is.

1208
01:05:39,750 --> 01:05:42,190
You all might as well just rest.
This is going to take all night.

1209
01:05:42,190 --> 01:05:44,250
- Did you never get it lit?
- No.

1210
01:05:44,250 --> 01:05:48,010
- This next round is never going to end.
- Kwang Soo, you have to win this round.

1211
01:05:48,010 --> 01:05:50,050
- Okay.
- We have to win this, Jong Kook.

1212
01:05:50,050 --> 01:05:51,120
- Okay.
- It's a one on one.

1213
01:05:51,120 --> 01:05:53,790
The next mission is...
Tissue blowing mission.

1214
01:05:53,790 --> 01:05:56,640
- Tissue blowing mission!
- We have to do something more dynamic!

1215
01:05:56,650 --> 01:05:59,280
How much more dynamic do
you want to get?

1216
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:00,880
[What?]

1217
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:02,880
I will show you how dynamic
tissue blowing can be.

1218
01:06:05,070 --> 01:06:07,090
You have to win this, Kwang Soo.

1219
01:06:07,100 --> 01:06:11,930
Both of you have to blow on the tissue
and the one who keeps it afloat longer wins.

1220
01:06:11,930 --> 01:06:13,710
You just have to keep it afloat
longer than your opponent.

1221
01:06:13,710 --> 01:06:17,200
The team that the winner of this
round belongs to

1222
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:18,950
will win themselves another
piece of evidence.

1223
01:06:18,950 --> 01:06:21,460
[The final battle with the evidence
to the trial hanging on the balance!]

1224
01:06:21,460 --> 01:06:23,330
- Fighting!
- You have to beat him!

1225
01:06:23,960 --> 01:06:26,030
I will show you that our team is innocent!

1226
01:06:26,360 --> 01:06:28,920
[Defendant Team's Kwang Soo.]

1227
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:32,000
Hey, you have to win this no matter what.

1228
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,540
[Let's find the culprit and
shed light to the truth!]

1229
01:06:34,550 --> 01:06:37,190
[Prosecution Team's Kkuk.]

1230
01:06:37,190 --> 01:06:38,490
There's only one chance.

1231
01:06:38,490 --> 01:06:40,280
Okay, the positioning looks good.

1232
01:06:40,860 --> 01:06:43,020
[The Tissue Blowing game with two pieces of
evidence on the line starts now!]

1233
01:06:55,650 --> 01:06:58,180
[Kkuk's tissue falls to the ground
as soon as the game starts!]

1234
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:05,470
[What luck is this!]

1235
01:07:05,470 --> 01:07:08,530
[Defendant Team's Kwang Soo wins!]

1236
01:07:14,580 --> 01:07:18,900
[Victim Big-nose explodes.
Prosecution Team up in arms.]

1237
01:07:18,900 --> 01:07:21,270
It's because he's so tall
and he was able to blow it up high.

1238
01:07:22,020 --> 01:07:23,610
- We won.
- He's too tall.

1239
01:07:25,140 --> 01:07:28,900
[Village investigation mission-
Defendant Team wins!]

1240
01:07:29,820 --> 01:07:31,430
- We won two missions in a row.
- I can't believe it.

1241
01:07:31,430 --> 01:07:32,850
Red Team can follow me.

1242
01:07:32,850 --> 01:07:37,080
[Leading the team off to where the two
pieces of evidence are located.]

1243
01:07:37,080 --> 01:07:39,090
He's normally very good
at that game.

1244
01:07:39,090 --> 01:07:45,460
[Defendant Team can choose to use the evidence
that will be to their advantage at the end.]

1245
01:07:46,150 --> 01:07:48,460
- Here's the evidence.
- It's the evidence.

1246
01:07:48,460 --> 01:07:50,720
I can see the evidence here.

1247
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:52,420
Okay, here's your evidence.

1248
01:07:52,420 --> 01:07:54,050
Here.

1249
01:07:55,470 --> 01:07:57,920
[Defendant Team wins
their two pieces of evidence!]

1250
01:08:00,330 --> 01:08:02,730
[Hee Won unable to trust
his own teammates now.]

1251
01:08:06,330 --> 01:08:07,430
Let's go.

1252
01:08:07,470 --> 01:08:10,240
[Who will these evidences point to?]

1253
01:08:11,900 --> 01:08:14,380
[Heading back towards the courthouse
for the closing argument...]

1254

[One advantageous, and one disadvantageous
pieces of evidence at each round.]

1258
01:08:37,790 --> 01:08:43,120
[Depending on the choices the team makes,
they may either win or lose their case.]

1259
01:08:43,260 --> 01:08:44,980
[Looking at the photo.]

1260
01:08:46,040 --> 01:08:47,680
[An image of someone receiving
their mission?]

1261
01:08:49,640 --> 01:08:53,900
[Must be smart about how they
use their pieces of evidence...]

1262
01:08:57,110 --> 01:08:58,610
[An x-ray image?]

1263
01:08:58,610 --> 01:08:59,980
What is this?

1264
01:09:01,010 --> 01:09:02,390
File of the incident?

1265
01:09:02,830 --> 01:09:04,890
[All the evidence has been checked.]

1266

[July 22nd, 11:30 P.M.]

1267

01:09:13,110 --> 01:09:15,800
- Everyone stay firm, okay?
- Hello.

1269
01:09:17,180 --> 01:09:19,620
[Jury stands in the courtroom.]

1270
01:09:20,970 --> 01:09:22,230
We promise that we will catch the culprit.

1271
01:09:22,240 --> 01:09:24,150
We know who the culprit is.

1272
01:09:24,150 --> 01:09:26,120
Don't be persuaded otherwise,
and remember what we talked about.

1273
01:09:26,120 --> 01:09:28,020
- Yes.
- Yes, we know.

1274
01:09:28,030 --> 01:09:29,560
The culprit is definitely in this room.

1275
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:33,770
Everyone stand.

1276
01:09:34,730 --> 01:09:36,750
[Presiding Judge enters the court.]

1277
01:09:37,250 --> 01:09:38,200
Let's take a seat.

1278
01:09:40,590 --> 01:09:44,860
Okay, Case Number 157.
Smack to the head in the Darkroom.

1279
01:09:44,860 --> 01:09:46,580
We will now reach our verdict.

1280
01:09:46,580 --> 01:09:52,130
This trial will now reconvene as
a trial by the jury.

1281
01:09:52,830 --> 01:09:57,100
The members of this jury consists of citizens
who are unbiased of this case

1282
01:09:57,100 --> 01:10:00,900
and they will judge the verdict based
only on the showing of the evidence.

1283
01:10:02,240 --> 01:10:05,620
I ask that the jury listens to each side,
and make a fair judgment call.

1284
01:10:06,060 --> 01:10:08,350
We will now start the final closing argument.

Please make your judgment based on the
showing of the gathered evidence.

1286

Please make sure to show your evidence
in the order that they were won.

1287
01:10:20,040 --> 01:10:21,780
[I vow to catch the culprit who
committed the earmuff assault.]

1288
01:10:22,780 --> 01:10:23,840
[We're not the culprits.]

1289
01:10:24,570 --> 01:10:26,830
[Attorney Yoo to start off his argument.]

1290
01:10:27,510 --> 01:10:29,490
What is he thinking wearing a hat
inside the courtroom?

1291
01:10:30,370 --> 01:10:32,220
Seriously!

1292
01:10:36,050 --> 01:10:38,000
Honorable Judge.

1293
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:39,780
And the members of the jury.

1294
01:10:41,120 --> 01:10:45,310
Ji Suk Jin, who claims that he was hit by one
of the defendants who you see up here...

1295
01:10:45,310 --> 01:10:50,820
I have evidence here in my hand which will
show just what type of a person he is!

1296

[Evidence which will show just what
type of a person Ji Suk Jin normally is?]

This evidence in my hand!

1298
01:10:57,260 --> 01:11:00,670
I would like to submit this evidence
to the Honorable Judge.

1299
01:11:01,640 --> 01:11:04,820
I would like for everyone to take a look
at this conclusive piece of evidence.

1300
01:11:04,820 --> 01:11:09,540
I would like for the members of the jury
and the Honorable Judge to decide

1301
01:11:09,540 --> 01:11:11,000
just what kind of a person
Ji Suk Jin truly is.

1302
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:12,300
The whole world needs to see this!

1303
01:11:12,950 --> 01:11:14,720
Okay, please show the evidence.

1304
01:11:14,720 --> 01:11:16,670
I'm a very nice and innocent person
who doesn't know how to lie.

1306
01:11:23,240 --> 01:11:26,550
[Easy Brothers' Spy Episode.]

1307
01:11:26,550 --> 01:11:27,890
I'm sure all of you know
when this is from.

1308
01:11:27,900 --> 01:11:31,590
This is the episode where Ji Suk Jin and
Lee Kwang Soo first became the leads.

1309
01:11:31,590 --> 01:11:33,590
[Looking extremely happy to be the
star of an episode for once.]

1310
01:11:34,900 --> 01:11:37,350
- What is this?
- Take a look at the next clip.

1311
01:11:37,350 --> 01:11:39,620
[Next up is the Sherlock Holmes Episode.]

1312
01:11:41,710 --> 01:11:48,660
Having shown some special favors after
making complaints to the writers.

1313
01:11:50,790 --> 01:11:53,340
This is a scene from our
last week's episode.

1314
01:11:53,340 --> 01:11:55,160
It's embarrassing for us to even watch.

1315
01:11:56,470 --> 01:11:59,500
Do you see how he shoved
his own team members?

1316
01:11:59,500 --> 01:12:01,370
[Killing off his own team members.]

1317
01:12:02,720 --> 01:12:04,760
Did you see that?
The greed!

1318
01:12:04,760 --> 01:12:06,260
Did you see his greedy he became?

1319
01:12:06,260 --> 01:12:07,730
- Greed!
- The greed!

1320
01:12:13,640 --> 01:12:16,850
[And the pathetic defeat.]

1321
01:12:17,730 --> 01:12:21,070
[That's a bad piece of
evidence against him...]

1322
01:12:21,070 --> 01:12:22,750
This is the evidence we have
to show thus far.

1323
01:12:23,850 --> 01:12:25,620
Ji Suk Jin's normal self...

1324
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:27,070
You all know him, don't you?

1325
01:12:27,070 --> 01:12:28,480
There's no need to even say it.

1326
01:12:28,480 --> 01:12:30,100
- He's a bad person!
- What?

1327
01:12:30,100 --> 01:12:32,460
- What do you mean, a bad person?
- You are a bad person!

1328
01:12:32,460 --> 01:12:35,840
- I'm an innocent victim!
- Unsatisfied with his role...

1329
01:12:36,620 --> 01:12:39,430
He's always been greedy for
the role of being the show's star.

1330
01:12:39,430 --> 01:12:40,780
[Big-nose always having wanted to
become the star of the show.]

1331
01:12:40,780 --> 01:12:42,650
Even though any one of us
would like to be the star of the show

1332
01:12:42,650 --> 01:12:45,880
he is the only one who directly
approached the writers

1333
01:12:45,880 --> 01:12:49,260
to let them know that he would like to be
made the star of the show.

1334
01:12:49,260 --> 01:12:50,850
There aren't many other who would
have done what he did. However...

1335
01:12:51,150 --> 01:12:52,950
Our Ji Suk Jin...

1336
01:12:53,380 --> 01:12:56,760
he has approached countless numbers of
our writers and repeatedly pleaded his case

1337
01:12:56,770 --> 01:12:58,250
to ask for a special show written about him.

1338
01:12:58,250 --> 01:13:02,950
And just last week, he shoved Minzy
of 2NE1 off the water platform.

1339
01:13:03,350 --> 01:13:05,160
Yes, that was just last week.
You all saw that, right?

1340
01:13:05,160 --> 01:13:08,080
In order to stand in the limelight himself,
he shoved off all his own teammates.

1341
01:13:08,350 --> 01:13:12,360
He shoved Jong Kook and Blank Ji
off the water platform into the pool

1342
01:13:12,360 --> 01:13:17,930
and he even leg tripped Minzy who just
turned 20 years old, out of greed.

1343
01:13:17,930 --> 01:13:21,250
He showed us a very pathetic
and tacky side of himself!

1344
01:13:21,260 --> 01:13:24,590
I'm sure that even all the members of
the jury saw that clearly for themselves.

1345
01:13:24,590 --> 01:13:27,560
Therefore...
the incident in question...

1346
01:13:27,560 --> 01:13:32,780
is a fabricated story that the writers and
Ji Suk Jin wrote and came up with.

1347
01:13:32,980 --> 01:13:35,390
This is all just a fabrication!

1348
01:13:35,400 --> 01:13:38,550
I would like to clearly state and
make everyone see the truth behind that.

1349
01:13:38,550 --> 01:13:40,670
- No further statements.
- That's just absurd!

1350
01:13:40,670 --> 01:13:42,040
I was hit in my ears!

1351
01:13:42,040 --> 01:13:46,030
Ji Suk Jin cares for and cherishes his body
more than anything else.

1352
01:13:46,030 --> 01:13:47,120
That's correct!

1353
01:13:47,360 --> 01:13:51,300
- So?
- I wouldn't hit myself and hurt myself.

1354
01:13:51,340 --> 01:13:54,060
[He's not the type of person to hit
himself and bring himself that kind of pain.]

1355
01:13:54,060 --> 01:13:56,650
What if by hitting yourself,
you be made the star of the episode?

1356
01:13:57,530 --> 01:13:59,800
[Hm?]

1357
01:13:59,800 --> 01:14:02,050
[Prosecution Team keeping him
from saying anything.]

1358
01:14:02,490 --> 01:14:04,600
- Don't say anything!
- Don't respond to that!

1359
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:09,520
Even the members of the jury know how much
Ji Suk Jin cares for his own body.

1360
01:14:09,520 --> 01:14:12,160
And Ji Suk Jin is known
for his inability to lie.

1361
01:14:12,160 --> 01:14:14,130
- Ji Suk Jin is a good liar.
- I can't lie.

1362
01:14:14,130 --> 01:14:17,730
I've seen you lie to your wife a countless
number of times in the past ten plus years.

1363
01:14:19,260 --> 01:14:21,060
That's something for the family court!

1364
01:14:21,060 --> 01:14:23,020
- This isn't the time for that!
- I saw him do it!

1365
01:14:23,020 --> 01:14:25,910
- This is not the setting for this!
- He lies to his wife all the time!

1366
01:14:26,480 --> 01:14:29,050
I only did that for the sake of
keeping the peace within my family.

1367
01:14:29,690 --> 01:14:31,700
This case is irrelevant to
those statements.

1368
01:14:31,700 --> 01:14:34,180
We will only hear the statements
that are relevant to this case.

1369
01:14:34,820 --> 01:14:38,420
If there are no further statements,
we will move on to the next piece of evidence.

1370
01:14:38,420 --> 01:14:41,530
- Okay, it's us.
- Prosecution may make their statement.

1371
01:14:41,530 --> 01:14:43,400
- Okay.
- Let's show them how to do this.

1372
01:14:45,440 --> 01:14:48,680
I don't think there's even a need for any
further evidence after this one.

1373
01:14:48,680 --> 01:14:50,390
[Conclusive piece of evidence?]

1374
01:14:51,170 --> 01:14:54,500
- I believe that you'll see the truth in it.
- I believe you'll know what it is.

1375
01:14:54,510 --> 01:14:56,780
It's a conclusive piece of evidence.

1376
01:14:57,230 --> 01:15:00,610
[It looks like a picture of some sort...]

1377
01:15:00,610 --> 01:15:02,440
Why don't we all take a look?
Please look up at the screen.

1378
01:15:08,480 --> 01:15:10,970
[A picture of Woong In?]

1379
01:15:11,780 --> 01:15:15,080
This picture was taken around
1 P.M. this afternoon.

1380
01:15:15,850 --> 01:15:18,500
This picture was taken in a location
nearby where the incident took place.

1381
01:15:18,500 --> 01:15:20,680
- Can you tell us who that is in the picture?
- It's me.

1382
01:15:20,680 --> 01:15:21,990
- Yes, it is.
- Yes.

1383
01:15:23,280 --> 01:15:26,950
- Who's the man that you're sitting with?
- It'd the PD who's sitting over there.

1384
01:15:26,950 --> 01:15:30,250
[None other than the PD in charge of the show
meeting with Defendant Woong In.]

1385
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:32,590
Yes, it is.
In that case...

1386
01:15:32,590 --> 01:15:36,130
What were you talking about
with the chief PD?

1387
01:15:36,130 --> 01:15:38,850
I arrived a little earlier than
I thought I was going to be.

1388
01:15:39,610 --> 01:15:42,770
So I just sat down with him to thank him
for inviting me onto the show.

1389
01:15:42,770 --> 01:15:45,220
[Stating that they shared
a normal conversation...]

1390
01:15:46,440 --> 01:15:48,870
[The prosecution stand getting excited.]

1391
01:15:49,860 --> 01:15:52,660
Honorable Judge and
the members of the jury.

1392
01:15:52,900 --> 01:15:57,650
The defendant had a private meeting with
the PD in charge before the show started.

1393
01:15:57,650 --> 01:15:58,700
Yes, that's correct.

1394
01:15:58,700 --> 01:16:00,230
You need to look towards the camera.

1395
01:16:03,150 --> 01:16:04,680
It's because I have so much respect
for the presiding Judge!

1396
01:16:05,080 --> 01:16:07,440
Please give me your attention.

1397
01:16:07,450 --> 01:16:12,170
Arriving before any other members to meet
with the PD on the day of the recoding...

1398
01:16:12,170 --> 01:16:16,510
The meaning behind such a private and
secluded meeting like that...

1399
01:16:17,200 --> 01:16:18,730
What is this?
Am I the star of this episode?

1400
01:16:19,300 --> 01:16:24,210
[On average...]

1401
01:16:24,210 --> 01:16:27,400
[It's with the purpose of...]

1402
01:16:27,400 --> 01:16:31,870
[relaying special missions
such as this?]

1403
01:16:32,910 --> 01:16:35,490
- Whether to be told that you're the spy...
- That's correct!

1404
01:16:35,490 --> 01:16:37,380
- Or the star of that episode...
- Yes!

1405
01:16:37,640 --> 01:16:41,310
It's to receive a special order
such as that!

1406
01:16:41,310 --> 01:16:43,100
[Shows up early to receive a special
mission unbeknownst to others?]

1407
01:16:43,100 --> 01:16:45,990
That's the only reason why anyone would
have a private meeting with the PD!

1408
01:16:45,990 --> 01:16:48,360
- Take a look!
- It looks like a serious conversation.

1409
01:16:48,370 --> 01:16:51,030
He's intently listening to something.
Look at his serious expression.

1410
01:16:51,030 --> 01:16:55,230
That expression on his face isn't someone who's
casually thanking someone for the invite.

1411
01:16:55,230 --> 01:16:57,590
- This conversation here...
- He's such an amateur.

1412
01:16:57,590 --> 01:17:01,570
- He's such an amateur!
- Look at the secretive look on his face!

1413
01:17:01,570 --> 01:17:03,920
Look at the serious glint
in his eyes!

1414
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:06,690
[Stating that his expression
looks too serious.]

1415
01:17:08,430 --> 01:17:11,950
- That's all.
- What was all that about?

1416
01:17:13,720 --> 01:17:17,170
- What were you even talking about?
- I'm saying that what Woong In said...

1417
01:17:20,390 --> 01:17:21,700
Get out here!

1418
01:17:22,680 --> 01:17:25,690
[Fit of rage in the courtroom?]

1419
01:17:25,690 --> 01:17:27,240
Please take a look at his behavior.

1420
01:17:27,810 --> 01:17:29,610
He's very violent.

1421
01:17:29,610 --> 01:17:31,480
Send him out.
He's not helping any.

1422
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:33,180
He's going to make us lose our case.

1423
01:17:33,180 --> 01:17:34,640
- Judge.
- Yes?

1424
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:37,730
- We have a witness.
- A witness!

1425
01:17:37,730 --> 01:17:40,470
- A witness?
- Its none other than our Prosecutor Gae.

1426
01:17:41,060 --> 01:17:44,660
[Calling Prosecutor Gae into the witness
stand for having been on scene.]

1427
01:17:45,070 --> 01:17:49,110
I was on the scene at the
time of the crime.

1428
01:17:49,110 --> 01:17:52,070
[About to explain the incident
at the time of the crime.]

1429
01:17:52,850 --> 01:17:55,420
[Attorney Yoo in charge of
defending the suspects.]

1430
01:17:55,420 --> 01:17:58,050
- Do you swear to only speak the truth?
- I swear.

1431
01:17:58,050 --> 01:18:00,160
- I swear to only speak the truth.
- Yes, thank you.

1432
01:18:00,160 --> 01:18:04,010
- If you lie on oath, you can be punished.
- Til the day I die.

1433
01:18:05,920 --> 01:18:09,400
This is how we were all seated
at the scene of the crime.

1434
01:18:09,410 --> 01:18:14,300
And the sofa was placed in the
U shape around the coffee table.

1435
01:18:14,300 --> 01:18:15,920
I ask that members of the jury
pay close attention to this.

1436
01:18:15,930 --> 01:18:20,700
Defendant Ahn Gil Kang was seated
to the left of me at the time.

1437
01:18:20,700 --> 01:18:25,240
And to the right of me
was Defendant Jung Woong In.

1438
01:18:26,060 --> 01:18:29,240
This is where I was seated in the beginning.
That's where I was seated at first.

1439
01:18:29,500 --> 01:18:32,160
But Jung Woong In kept insisting
on sitting where I was seated.

1440
01:18:32,160 --> 01:18:33,710
[Jung Woong In insisted on siting
where Ha Ha was seated?]

1441
01:18:33,710 --> 01:18:36,370
Ji Suk Jin was seated right
across from where I sat at first.

1442
01:18:36,370 --> 01:18:40,290
So he situated himself in the spot which
was the easiest spot for him to hit him.

1443
01:18:40,290 --> 01:18:42,480
I was shoved out of my seat
so that he could take over my spot.

1444
01:18:42,480 --> 01:18:45,470
And next to me sat Kim Hee Won.

1445
01:18:46,320 --> 01:18:51,720
[Prosecution Team lays out how
everyone was seated around the table.]

1446
01:18:51,720 --> 01:18:55,520
[The light went out for only five seconds.]

1447
01:18:55,520 --> 01:18:58,100
[The person who had the access to hit
Ji Suk Jin on his head was?]

1448
01:18:58,100 --> 01:19:01,020
It had to be either Ji Suk Jin,
or Lee Kwang Soo.

1449
01:19:01,020 --> 01:19:03,620
If the PD himself hit the victim, then he's
not even fit to be called a human being!

1450
01:19:04,910 --> 01:19:10,220
In which case, it has to be either
Lee Kwang Soo or Jung Woong In.

1451
01:19:10,220 --> 01:19:12,850
[Prosecution stand indicts Lee Kwang Soo
or Jung Woong In as the culprits.]

1452
01:19:12,860 --> 01:19:14,570
No! It's most likely
that he did it to himself!

1453
01:19:16,310 --> 01:19:17,530
[Self fabricated story?]

1454
01:19:17,530 --> 01:19:19,810
[He did it to himself?]

1455
01:19:20,780 --> 01:19:23,240
The most important fact to remember...

1456
01:19:23,240 --> 01:19:26,260
is that after the light went out...

1457
01:19:26,910 --> 01:19:29,560
and right before the light
came back on...

1458
01:19:31,020 --> 01:19:33,610
[Waiting room when it was
thrown into a pitch of darkness.]

1459
01:19:33,610 --> 01:19:36,030
I was seated in my seat.

1460
01:19:36,030 --> 01:19:38,740
And right before the lights
came back on...

1461
01:19:38,740 --> 01:19:42,600
I felt someone rushing back
to their seat just like that.

1462
01:19:42,610 --> 01:19:44,620
[He felt someone else rushing back
to take their seat?]

1463
01:19:44,620 --> 01:19:47,180
The difference between someone jumping
up from their seat and sitting back down

1464
01:19:47,370 --> 01:19:51,330
and the feeling of someone rushing back to
their seat to sit down is very different.

1465
01:19:51,330 --> 01:19:55,440
Unless I'm a total idiot,
I'd be able to feel something like that.

1466
01:19:55,440 --> 01:19:57,290
- Kang Gary can't lie.
- But you are an idiot.

1467
01:19:58,570 --> 01:20:00,460
[What?]

1468
01:20:01,730 --> 01:20:05,870
You have shown us your evidence,
and made your statements.

1469
01:20:05,870 --> 01:20:09,690
But one must remember that the act of
hitting someone is evidence in itself.

1470
01:20:10,820 --> 01:20:13,920
What Kang Gary just stated
isn't direct evidence in itself.

1471
01:20:13,920 --> 01:20:17,060
He didn't say that he saw the hit,
but that he felt someone move.

1472
01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:21,780
The image of Jung Woong In and
the PD having a conversation...

1473
01:20:22,390 --> 01:20:25,290
that's all just speculation of
what may have gone on.

1474
01:20:25,290 --> 01:20:26,560
It's all just speculation on their part.

1475
01:20:27,570 --> 01:20:31,130
Someone sitting next to Kang Gary
as he stated...

1476
01:20:31,130 --> 01:20:32,640
that's also just a speculation.

1477
01:20:32,640 --> 01:20:35,120
All of this is just
circumstantial speculation.

1478
01:20:35,120 --> 01:20:38,090
[These are nothing but
circumstantial evidence.]

1479
01:20:38,090 --> 01:20:43,190
What we need is solid evidence of someone
seeing a person get up from their seat

1480
01:20:43,190 --> 01:20:45,750
or the recording of someone moving
off their seats in the security camera.

1481
01:20:45,750 --> 01:20:49,530
Something for the members of the jury
that are sitting in the stand

1482
01:20:49,540 --> 01:20:51,400
or the Honorable Judge in his seat...

1483
01:20:51,400 --> 01:20:55,580
to be convinced of the who the culprit is...
some irrefutable evidence is needed.

1484
01:20:55,580 --> 01:20:59,110
Just because he's known for his
villain roles and circumstantial evidence...

1485
01:20:59,110 --> 01:21:00,290
That's correct!

1486
01:21:00,290 --> 01:21:05,070
[The defendants cannot be indicted as being
guilty just from circumstantial evidence.]

1487
01:21:05,070 --> 01:21:07,250
What you're doing isn't just!

1488
01:21:07,250 --> 01:21:09,120
- Another thing...
- That's a great point!

1489
01:21:10,500 --> 01:21:12,120
- What are you doing?
- I think that he has a valid point.

1490
01:21:12,120 --> 01:21:13,410
I'd like to say one more thing.

1491
01:21:13,410 --> 01:21:15,020
- Gary mentioned this himself.
- Yes?

1492
01:21:15,020 --> 01:21:16,940
Do you think that the PD hit you?

1493
01:21:16,940 --> 01:21:18,210
- That's what he said.
- Yes.

1494
01:21:18,460 --> 01:21:19,790
If...

1495
01:21:20,180 --> 01:21:23,190
If the PD in charge and
Ji Suk Jin really planned it...

1496
01:21:23,540 --> 01:21:25,830
and PD was the one who hit him?

1497
01:21:25,830 --> 01:21:28,080
Isn't that also just pure speculation?

1498
01:21:28,080 --> 01:21:29,380
That is all I have for now.

1499
01:21:30,030 --> 01:21:32,570
[Attorney Yoo could be right.]

1500
01:21:34,220 --> 01:21:38,660
[One of the pieces of evidence that
the Prosecution Team had earlier...]

1501
01:21:38,660 --> 01:21:41,820
[was a picture like this one.]

1502
01:21:45,610 --> 01:21:48,570
We will now move on to
the final piece of evidence.

1503
01:21:48,580 --> 01:21:50,810
Defense Team may present their evidence.

1504
01:21:50,820 --> 01:21:53,230
- You have another evidence?
- We...

1505
01:21:53,230 --> 01:21:59,160
We received a warrant to
confiscate Ji Suk Jin's cellphone.

1506
01:21:59,160 --> 01:22:05,240
We will now take a look through
Ji Suk Jin's cellphone.

1507
01:22:05,990 --> 01:22:08,910
- It's a warrant.
- This is injustice!

1508
01:22:08,910 --> 01:22:12,950
- Please hand over the phone.
- This could be the end of my family life.

1509
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:16,620
Please unlock your cellphone.

1510
01:22:17,160 --> 01:22:18,410
There it is right away.

1511
01:22:18,960 --> 01:22:20,320
PD Jo.

1512
01:22:20,320 --> 01:22:23,730
[Call log and text messages from PD Jo?]

1513
01:22:24,180 --> 01:22:28,800
Every one of the jury and
Honorable Judge...

1514
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:31,280
Please take a look at the correspondence
that took place between them up on the screen.

1515
01:22:32,770 --> 01:22:34,050
Okay.

1516
01:22:34,680 --> 01:22:35,960
Are you seeing this?

1517
01:22:35,960 --> 01:22:39,530
July 22nd, 12:22 P.M.

1518
01:22:39,530 --> 01:22:42,070
Do you see all the call logs?

1519
01:22:42,430 --> 01:22:45,380
There is a message right here.
12:25- 'Are you on the way?'

1520
01:22:45,380 --> 01:22:47,060
Response, 'I'm almost there'.

1521
01:22:47,450 --> 01:22:49,840
- 'Are you here?'
- 'Okay'

1522
01:22:50,530 --> 01:22:52,000
Scroll down.

1523
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:53,480
This is the important one.

1524
01:22:53,890 --> 01:22:55,550
[The correspondence that
breeds suspicion.]

1525
01:22:55,820 --> 01:22:58,840
- 'You didn't tell the other members?'
- What did he say in response?

1526
01:22:59,300 --> 01:23:01,570
- 'You didn't tell the other members?'
- 'Okay.'

1527
01:23:01,570 --> 01:23:04,940
Every one of the jury,
what time did we all meet today?

1528
01:23:04,940 --> 01:23:06,700
We were to meet at 1:30.

1529
01:23:06,700 --> 01:23:09,570
- 1:30.
- I got here at 1:50.

1530
01:23:10,780 --> 01:23:14,700
Then why did Ji Suk Jin arrive here
before the rest of us?

1531
01:23:14,900 --> 01:23:16,070
And also...

1532
01:23:16,390 --> 01:23:19,720
Ji Suk Jin and PD Jo never talks to each other
unless there's something special going on.

1533
01:23:19,720 --> 01:23:20,740
But...

1534
01:23:21,800 --> 01:23:23,820
[He's admitting to that point?]

1535
01:23:24,110 --> 01:23:27,570
He showed up half hour to an hour
before the rest of us

1536
01:23:27,570 --> 01:23:29,750
and exchanged those messages with
the PD. Why is that?

1537
01:23:29,750 --> 01:23:31,260
- Honorable Judge!
- I object!

1538
01:23:31,260 --> 01:23:34,080
- His questions are leading!
- Please wait.

1539
01:23:34,090 --> 01:23:35,690
What we just saw up on the screen...

1540
01:23:36,200 --> 01:23:40,390
is enough to show that these two talked about
something that we're not aware of.

1541
01:23:41,250 --> 01:23:42,490
That this episode...

1542
01:23:43,260 --> 01:23:49,350
is a show that was planned and made up
by PD Jo and Ji Suk Jin.

1543
01:23:49,900 --> 01:23:52,520
- No, that's absurd.
- Then Jung Woong In earlier...

1544
01:23:52,530 --> 01:23:57,450
[Then what of the picture that was taken
of Jung Woong In and the PD?]

1545
01:23:57,460 --> 01:23:59,410
I believe that the picture is a setup.

1546
01:23:59,410 --> 01:24:00,980
When it comes to that,
aren't you the expert in it?

1547
01:24:01,570 --> 01:24:03,150
I didn't take the picture.

1548
01:24:03,970 --> 01:24:06,070
Okay, that's enough.
Lee Kwang Soo is...

1549
01:24:09,390 --> 01:24:10,830
I don't want you to talk.

1550
01:24:15,590 --> 01:24:17,200
Aren't I allowed to say
anything at all?

1551
01:24:17,200 --> 01:24:20,050
Honorable Judge,
and the members of the jury.

1552
01:24:22,710 --> 01:24:27,080
I was hit twice in my ears.

1553
01:24:27,680 --> 01:24:29,790
He was once hit in the face
at a nightclub.

1554
01:24:29,800 --> 01:24:31,910
[What?]

1555
01:24:32,790 --> 01:24:35,180
[Breaking out into fits of laughter.]

1556
01:24:35,180 --> 01:24:38,520
He was acting up and got beat up
by all the big guys at the club.

1557
01:24:40,780 --> 01:24:42,320
Honorable Judge.

1558
01:24:42,320 --> 01:24:44,740
I ask that you find out
the truth for us.

1559
01:24:47,230 --> 01:24:49,190
It is time for the final closing statement.

1560
01:24:50,620 --> 01:24:53,680
[Prosecution's final closing statement.]

1561
01:24:53,680 --> 01:24:59,270
Victim Ji Suk Jin has been like an older
brother to all of us for the past three years

1562
01:24:59,270 --> 01:25:02,180
and he is always the first one ousted
and alerts us of the race starting.

1563
01:25:02,630 --> 01:25:06,810
And he's always been the one to raise
others up rather than himself.

1564
01:25:07,190 --> 01:25:10,900
And he has never once complained to others
about the position he's been in

1565
01:25:10,900 --> 01:25:14,060
or expressed any displeasure
to the writers on staff.

1566
01:25:14,340 --> 01:25:15,660
Why are you laughing?

1567
01:25:16,710 --> 01:25:19,880
And today, without any reason...
he was assaulted violently by someone.

1568
01:25:19,880 --> 01:25:26,130
And there are many circumstantial speculations
shown in the evidence today.

1569
01:25:26,440 --> 01:25:32,280
Therefore, I believe that it is unreasonable
to see this as fabricated story from Suk Jin.

1570
01:25:32,280 --> 01:25:38,540
However, the reason why we're stating that
Jung Woong In is the likeliest culprit

1571
01:25:38,540 --> 01:25:41,320
is because it's a very highly
likeable probability.

1572
01:25:41,320 --> 01:25:44,720
We, the prosecution, believe that there is
enough supporting evidence to back that up.

1573
01:25:45,280 --> 01:25:47,690
I ask that you make the right
and just verdict.

1574
01:25:50,780 --> 01:25:53,020
- I will now start my closing statement.
- Please take off your glasses.

1575
01:25:53,020 --> 01:25:54,280
Take them off.

1576
01:25:55,280 --> 01:25:59,110
[Taking off his classes to make
his serious closing statement.]

1577
01:25:59,110 --> 01:26:00,120
Honorable Judge and the members of the jury.

1578
01:26:00,120 --> 01:26:04,390
As I'm sure you've all seen already,
these men here are known for being villains.

1579
01:26:06,990 --> 01:26:08,360
I'm sorry.

1580
01:26:10,120 --> 01:26:12,770
I just received a complaint from
one of my defendants.

1581
01:26:12,770 --> 01:26:14,700
[Attorney Yoo receiving complaints about
the way he looks without his glasses.]

1582
01:26:14,700 --> 01:26:17,920
- The viewers may be uncomfortable too.
- Yes, I've received complaints about this.

1583
01:26:17,920 --> 01:26:19,400
- Yes, I understand.
- So I must put the glasses back on.

1584
01:26:19,400 --> 01:26:20,580
Thank you.

1585
01:26:21,700 --> 01:26:23,590
Because...

1586
01:26:23,590 --> 01:26:27,100
of their momentary frightening expressions
that's seen on their faces...

1587
01:26:28,130 --> 01:26:32,190
Because of the rough and villainous
roles that they've often played...

1588
01:26:32,200 --> 01:26:36,150
they are receiving this unfairly
based misunderstanding.

1589
01:26:36,700 --> 01:26:39,610
If the members of the jury could
switch your positions

1590
01:26:39,610 --> 01:26:42,300
and look at this from their perspective

1591
01:26:42,300 --> 01:26:45,590
how frustrated and upset would you be
from the injustice of it all?

1592
01:26:45,590 --> 01:26:46,970
[What have they ever done wrong besides
play villainous roles in movies?]

1593
01:26:47,220 --> 01:26:49,350
There is a saying that I'd like to mention.

1594
01:26:49,670 --> 01:26:52,770
'Even if you lose the catch
to capture the ten criminals...

1595
01:26:52,770 --> 01:26:56,740
you must not let even a single
innocent man suffer injustice.'

1596
01:26:57,610 --> 01:27:02,050
That infamous legal saying
was created for situation like this.

1597
01:27:02,050 --> 01:27:04,310
This is what I'd like to state
at this moment.

1598
01:27:04,820 --> 01:27:07,110
Even though I may not know who
is responsible for today's crime

1599
01:27:07,110 --> 01:27:08,620
please...

1600
01:27:09,140 --> 01:27:12,990
don't let these men suffer from injustice
for having played villainous roles.

1601
01:27:12,990 --> 01:27:14,980
That is all.

1602
01:27:15,580 --> 01:27:18,280
We will take a brief recess for
the jury to make their verdict.

1603
01:27:20,890 --> 01:27:24,370
[Just what will come of the verdict?]

1604
01:27:25,100 --> 01:27:27,270
One of them hit me in my ears!
On both sides.

1605
01:27:28,650 --> 01:27:30,990
- We're going to win this.
- It's at least a 20 year sentence.

1606
01:27:33,520 --> 01:27:36,750
I will show you what
a perfect crime looks like.

1607
01:27:37,240 --> 01:27:41,250
Ji Suk Jin has always dreamt of
being the star of this show.

1608
01:27:41,550 --> 01:27:46,090
The meaning behind meeting up with
the chief PD without anyone else knowing...

1609
01:27:46,100 --> 01:27:48,960
is to receive some sort of
secretive order.

1610
01:27:48,960 --> 01:27:52,370
[It's a premeditated crime.]

1611
01:27:53,050 --> 01:27:56,520
[It's a premeditated crime planned out
by Suk Jin and the PD?]

1612
01:27:56,520 --> 01:28:00,390
Why did he come an hour before
the rest of the members...

1613
01:28:00,390 --> 01:28:02,350
and exchange those messages
with the PD?

1614
01:28:06,090 --> 01:28:11,310
[Just... what is the truth?]

1615
01:28:13,290 --> 01:28:15,480
[The jury has reached a verdict.]

1616
01:28:16,770 --> 01:28:18,600
[The final verdict.]

1617
01:28:19,120 --> 01:28:21,440
- We have reached a verdict.
- I hope we get the innocent verdict.

1618
01:28:21,440 --> 01:28:23,650
- I believe in the members of the jury.
- Please.

1619
01:28:23,650 --> 01:28:25,780
- Please... please!
- Please.

1620
01:28:25,780 --> 01:28:29,240
Case- Smack to the head in the dark.
The final verdict is...

1621
01:28:29,240 --> 01:28:35,530
The case claims that the victim Ji Suk Jin was
assaulted in the wait room during the blackout

1622
01:28:35,530 --> 01:28:39,250
but there aren't any eye witnesses who
can testify to the victim's claims.

1623
01:28:41,730 --> 01:28:45,330
From the evidence of the pictures that
the prosecution team has submitted

1624
01:28:45,330 --> 01:28:49,400
Jung Woong In met with the PD before the
recording started to receive the orders

1625
01:28:49,410 --> 01:28:51,240
to assault Ji Suk Jin in the dark.

1626
01:28:51,250 --> 01:28:54,160
And thus, it's highly possible that he did
assault the victim as ordered.

1627
01:28:54,990 --> 01:28:56,210
However...

1628
01:28:56,210 --> 01:29:01,230
if Ji Suk Jin was going after the spotlight
as the defense is stating that he did...

1629
01:29:01,790 --> 01:29:07,120
also the call logs and the text message
records from Ji Suk Jin's phone we've seen

1630
01:29:07,160 --> 01:29:10,850
could also indicate that this said incident
is an event that he fabricated

1631
01:29:10,850 --> 01:29:13,770
or committed to himself in order to
garner more attention.

1632
01:29:13,770 --> 01:29:17,090
This is also a possible scenario
that we cannot ignore.

1633
01:29:18,350 --> 01:29:19,650
Therefore...

1634
01:29:19,660 --> 01:29:25,440
this case does not prove to be an incident
without its share of reasonable doubts.

1635
01:29:26,400 --> 01:29:31,930
And thus, we the jury would like to
reveal the verdict that's been decided.

1636
01:29:32,710 --> 01:29:34,470
That verdict...

1637
01:29:34,480 --> 01:29:36,400
That verdict...

1638
01:29:37,570 --> 01:29:40,080
In a vote of four against one...

1639
01:29:40,990 --> 01:29:47,470
Per Criminal Procedural Law Article 325,
to the defendants standing this trial...

1640
01:29:48,270 --> 01:29:51,570
we declare the defendants innocent.

1641
01:29:53,460 --> 01:29:56,880
[We'd like to thank Attorney No Seung Hyoo,
and Gwon Yuri for their assistance.]

1642
01:29:56,880 --> 01:29:58,490
I'd like to appeal this verdict.

1643
01:30:00,340 --> 01:30:03,460
[No culprit has been confirmed.]

1644
01:30:03,460 --> 01:30:05,130
Justice has been served!

1645
01:30:05,130 --> 01:30:07,570
I'm going to appeal this verdict,
so you need to clear your schedules.

1646
01:30:08,530 --> 01:30:10,030
We're going to appeal this verdict.

1647
01:30:10,040 --> 01:30:12,380
- You have to come back next week.
- Thank you for all the hard work.

1648
01:30:12,380 --> 01:30:14,990
- You'll be punished for this!
- You're a bad man.

1649
01:30:15,350 --> 01:30:18,360
[Gil Kang finally feeling justified
after having been suspected of the crime.]

1650
01:30:18,360 --> 01:30:20,730
- Wow... seriously.
- Anyways, it's all over now.

1651
01:30:20,730 --> 01:30:23,220
Why don't we get a nice warm
bowl of soft tofu soup?

1652
01:30:27,820 --> 01:30:30,240
It's because of this incompetent
group of prosecutors.

1653
01:30:30,250 --> 01:30:33,020
I'm a little suspicious now.
Why did you do it?

1654
01:30:33,030 --> 01:30:36,580
[Huh? Why did he do it?]

1655
01:30:36,580 --> 01:30:38,590
Did you do it?
Did you really do it?

1656
01:30:39,140 --> 01:30:42,910
- Me?
- You did do it! That's what your face says!

1657
01:30:43,950 --> 01:30:46,970
This is driving me crazy!
Doesn't anybody believe me?

1658
01:30:47,290 --> 01:30:50,310
- Just go in for now...
- Go in where?

1659
01:30:50,310 --> 01:30:52,730
Why would I?
Why would I go to jail?

1660
01:30:52,730 --> 01:30:55,190
Seriously!
This is injustice!

1661
01:30:57,560 --> 01:31:01,010
[Two hours ago]

1662
01:31:01,010 --> 01:31:02,490
What is this?

1663
01:31:03,740 --> 01:31:05,460
[A tape?]

1664
01:31:06,720 --> 01:31:09,570
[Definitive CCTV camera footage.]

1665
01:31:17,210 --> 01:31:19,160
I'm going to pretend that I
didn't see that.

1666
01:31:19,160 --> 01:31:20,950
We have to ignore this.

1667
01:31:21,280 --> 01:31:25,130
[They decide to get rid of
this piece of the evidence.]

1668
01:31:27,120 --> 01:31:31,090
[The evidence that was thrown away...]

1669
01:31:32,970 --> 01:31:36,530
[The footage on the tape...]

1670
01:31:41,520 --> 01:31:44,150
[The footage that captured
the whole scene.]

1671
01:31:45,510 --> 01:31:47,520
[A man that headed towards Suk Jin
as soon as the lights went out...]

1672
01:31:48,680 --> 01:31:50,060
- What the heck?
- What? What happened?

1673
01:31:51,870 --> 01:31:54,180
[The truth of the Earmuffs Assault.]

1674
01:31:54,820 --> 01:31:59,790
[The culprit is none other than...]

1675
01:32:01,160 --> 01:32:02,720
<i>Someone just hit me.</i>

1676
01:32:04,500 --> 01:32:08,650
[Jung Woong In commits the
perfect crime.]

1677
01:32:08,650 --> 01:32:11,550
