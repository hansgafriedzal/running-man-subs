00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:14,000
[FD Jae Chul from the
Tuesday evening show, Hwasin.]

28
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,550
- Do all the FD's look alike?
- How can they look so much alike?

29
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:19,300
- Are all the couples going to look alike?

00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:21,820

00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:51,420
[Self-proclaimed master of the variety world,

39
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:52,790
It's Kwang Gyu.

00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,640
- It's Kwang Gyu.
- That's his partner?

41
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,060
Why are you seriously doing
this to me?

42
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:01,500
[The party atmosphere
taking major downturn.]

43
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,840
- Kwang Gyu?
- That's a nice partner you've got there!

44
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,120
- What's with the dour atmosphere?
- It's nice to see you.

45
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,670
It's because of you!

46
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:10,550
I thought that Suk Jin
was going to be my partner.

47
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,100
- So that you could be the young blood?
- I thought I'd be the younger of the two.

48
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:18,320
What are you saying?
You're saying you're the young blood?

49
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,770
[Bright and shiny as the sun?]

50
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:24,560

[Self-proclaimed master of variety
showing his greed for Suk Jin's spot.]

52
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:32,530
This is going to drive me crazy.
He thinks he looks younger than me.

53
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:36,880
It's time for a trade.
It's time for Suk Jin to take a rest.

54
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:40,200
- Next, we'll welcome Ha Ha's partner.
- Ha Ha.

55
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:42,650

[With the way this is going,
will it really be the tuna sister?]

00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,160
Who is it?

58
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:54,450
- Who is it?
- Is that Sa Yuri?

59
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:59,560
[Woman with a 4 dimensional personality,

61
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:07,090
Hey, Sa Yuri!

00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:09,500
Look at the way she's walking!
She's already walking like this!

63
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,450
Watch your steps.

64
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:14,830
- Yuri, are you two friends?
- Yes, we're friends. We're the same age.

65
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:16,280
- Really?
- Yes.

66
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:21,310
Even though Yuri has been paired up
with Ha Ha on this episode

67
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:23,980
is there anyone else that you wanted
to be paired up with instead of Ha Ha?

68
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:25,140
- Yes, there is!
- Who?

69
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:26,990
- Kim Jong Kook.
- Why?

70
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:29,690
I really like him.
Everything about him is just so loveable.

71
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:33,080
- Why?
- I don't know, but he's just so delectable.

72
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,760
- He's delectable?
- Yes.

73
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:39,360
- What are you talking about?
- Ha Ha, you should step aside and concede.

74
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43,240
- Is it my turn now?
- Seeing who our guests have been so far...

75
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:46,200
- It's time for a pretty girl guest.
- What if it's someone from a girl group?

76
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,860
It's so hard to predict who it could be.

77
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:51,390
[Full of anticipation.
Please... come on out.]

78
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:54,180
[Peek-a-boo!]

79
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,700
[Heavyweight actor, Park Sang Myun.]

80
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:01,730
It's Myun Sang.
Look, it's Myun Sang.

81
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:04,480
What is this?
Sang Myun is my partner?

82
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,380
It's Myun Sang.
Park Myun Sang!

83
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:08,760
[Looking dapper for the party?]

84
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:14,080
[As a continuation from the last time,
partnering up with his friend again?]

85
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,680
Why do we keep getting partnered up
when we don't even like each other?

86
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,940
- It's nice to meet you.
- How do you and Kwang Gyu know each other?

87
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:23,010
We both made our debuts
in the same movie a long time ago.

88
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:26,890
[They made their debuts in the same movie?]

89
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:30,060
Look at how happy he is with that comment.
He really likes that.

90
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:33,600
- Look at how happy he is.
- I thought that he was older than me.

91
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,580
I thought that he was older than me.

92
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:39,770
But I came to find out...
he and I are the same age.

93
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,530
He just looks older than his age.

94
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:47,320
- You two are the same age?
- Yeah, we're the same age.

95
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,590
- But he's younger than me.
- Yeah, he's a year younger than you.

96
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:52,230
- But you and I are friends?
- How that works is...

97
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:55,030
- Have you been deceiving me this whole time?
- It's because of our birthdays.

98
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:57,020
- Get down on your knees!
- But my birthday is very early.

99
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:58,610
I'm just going to go home.

100
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:02,590
- So how old are you then?
- I think I've gained too much weight.

101
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,190
[Changing the subject...]

102
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:07,600
[Avoiding the sensitive topic.]

103
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,010
Look at how nervous he's become
since they started discussing their age.

104
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:14,880
Next, we'll welcome
Lee Kwang Soo's partner.

105
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,510
[Asian Prince, Kwang Soo's partner.]

106
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:19,150
It's possible that his partner will be a girl.

107
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:21,500
[Seeing how the guests are of similar age,
he could have a younger girl partner?]

108
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:24,720
- Kwang Soo's partner is going to be a girl.
- Come on out.

109
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:30,910
[Who could it be?]

110
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:36,500
It's a very tall person.

111
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:42,160
[The rising star of variety, John Park.]

112
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,830
[The rising star garnering much attention
since having debuted in the audition show.]

113
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:49,880
[A singer with boyish good looks
and heartfelt voice.]

114
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:52,220
- It's John Park!
- John Park?

115
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,480
- It's another Kwang Soo!
- They're very similar.

116
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:59,480
John park is the newest rising star
in the variety world!

117
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:01,940
- He's so tall.
- Hello.

118
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:03,790
I feel like I'm looking at another
Kwang Soo.

119
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:06,640
[The two look-alikes greet one another.]

120
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:10,470
John Park is pretty quirky himself.

121
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:13,490
- I wanted to be Kwang Soo's partner.
- Why?

122
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,720
- I felt like we'd really get along well.
- Why do you think that?

123
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:19,040
Why?
Is it wrong of me to think that?

124
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:24,000
[Oddball John Park...]

125
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,820
- Kwang Soo's done for today.
- I think today's going to be fun.

126
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:29,450
I can't wait to see who's going to
be the weirder one today.

127
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:32,400
- I don't want to lose to him.
- You have to bring out your A game.

128
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,250
Then there's only Ji Hyo
and one other person left.

129
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:37,700
- I'm sure Gary will be with Ji Hyo.
- I'm excited to see who it'll be myself.

130
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:41,120
- Get out there and greet your partner.
- Who do you think it'll be?

131
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:44,520
This one is for you!

132
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,150
I knew this was going to happen!

133
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:50,250
Ji Hyo is the best of the lot here!

134
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:53,410
[Miss Blank makes her entrance.]

135
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:55,420
Ji Hyo is the best out of the lot today.

136
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:58,740
- Ji Hyo really is the best today.
- Ji Hyo is the best of the lot today.

137
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:01,110
You need to feel honored.

138
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:05,280
I'm still saving you like this
even though today is Tuesday.

139
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,880
- You two look good together.
- You guys look really good together.

140
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:10,290
- They really look good together.
- Why do I feel like I'm being led?

141
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:12,290
<i>Next up is Kim Jong Kook's partner.</i>

142
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:15,210
[Then who's going to be Kkuk's partner?]

143
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:17,130
Who could it be?

144
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,900
[Who... who is that?]

145
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:31,700
[All Right- Kim Ye Rim.]

146
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:36,550
[Having garnered much attention on the
show with her dream-like voice.]

147
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:39,240
[New rising star, Kim Ye Rim,
having made a recent solo debut.]

148
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,040
- How did you get so lucky?
- Hello.

149
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,900
Why is Jong Kook the only one?

150
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:46,060
- Hello.
- Why did Jong Kook get Ye Rim?

151
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:49,300
- Why are you doing this to us?
- Are they friends?

152
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:50,750
- All right!
- Hello.

153

What the heck is this?
They have similar hair color.

154
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:58,680
- What are you talking about?
- They actually look good together.

155
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,970
- I can't believe Ye Rim is here.
- Hello.

156
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,470
- Look at him. There he goes again.
- Why are you taking your sunglasses off?

157
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:07,460
- Why are you taking off your sunglasses?
- We have to be able to see each other.

158
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:09,850
- Seriously!
- She's here as my partner.

159
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:12,850
- There's someone else waiting in the back.
- There are more guests?

160
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:14,970
You're saying we have more guests
waiting to come out?

161
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:18,680
Who is it?

162
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:25,770
[Jo Jung Chi and Jung In!]

163
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:27,720
- What is this?
- Jo Jung Chi?

164
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:30,000
- Jo Jung Chi and Jung In are here?
- What are those two doing here?

165
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,900
Aren't they a real life couple?

166
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:35,540
What is Jung Chi wearing?
What's with that jacket?

167
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:37,770
Why don't you two hold
each other's hands?

168
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:40,280
Going on various variety shows
are their usual dates.

169
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:43,210
Why don't you help her out?
She's having trouble walking in her heels!

170
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:45,380
- Why don't you give her some support?
- It's hard enough for me to walk myself.

171
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:47,500
Why don't you hold onto her
and give her some support?

172
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:50,870
[Anyway, welcome to the show.]

173
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:56,280
- Why are we being partnered up again?
- Why?

174
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,760
[Jung In unhappy with her partner?]

175
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,290
- You want someone else here as your partner?
- Yes.

176
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:02,030
Kwang Soo.

177
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:04,870
- He's mine.
- Why am I yours?

178
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:07,390
- Why am I yours?
- You should feel honored.

179
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:10,940
- This is really...
- This is a very strange setting today.

180
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:15,560
At this rate, I wouldn't be surprised if
Jo Gap Gyung and Hong Seo Beom came out.

181
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:18,660
This really feels like...

182
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:20,560
This feels really surreal today.

183
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:30,630
[A surreal combination...]

184
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:32,180
What's going on today?

185
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:36,630
We're going to have a couple race today where
you will be paired off in teams of two.

186
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:41,520
The title of today's race is...
'Couple, 1% of friendship.'

187
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,030
[Couple, 1% of friendship.]

188
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:48,170
You'll find out for yourself why today's race
is titled, 'Couple, 1% of friendship.'

189
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:52,280
First, I need one member of each team to step
forward and receive an item from me.

190
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,870
What are we getting?

191
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:56,540
- Isn't that gold?
- Oh, it's gold.

192
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:57,570
It's gold.

193
00:09:57,570 --> 00:10:00,250
- Is it a cellphone?
- No, it's real gold!

194
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:02,520
Is it real?

195
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,960
Wow, it's real gold!

196
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,940
It's real gold.

197
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:10,480
- Are you giving this to us?
- This is real?

198
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,830
- You're in a better mood now, aren't you?
- Yeah, I like it!

199
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,560
This is my first time seeing
gold like this.

200
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,180
- This is your first time?
- This is real gold.

201
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:20,560
- I've never seen a gold bar.
- Awesome.

202
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:24,080
<i>If you come in at the top in each
of your missions</i>

203
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:27,290
<i>you'll then receive additional gold bars.</i>

204
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:33,080
<i>In other words, you'll get a chance to take
your opponent's gold bars away from them.</i>

205
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:38,030
<i>The team that has the most number of
gold bars at the final mission</i>

206
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:40,490
<i>will receive an unbelievable advantage
for their team.</i>

207
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:43,880
<i>The first place winner can't have
their gold taken away from them.</i>

208
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:47,630
<i>I ask for each team to place their love
and friendship on the line and do their best.</i>

209
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:51,390
<i>And also, you will all be responsible
for the care of your own gold bars.</i>

210
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:55,910
<i>No one can help you if you lose, or have
your gold stolen from you along the way.</i>

211
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:57,470
<i>So if you lose it, then it's gone for good.</i>

212
00:10:57,470 --> 00:10:59,540
<i>We will not keep it for you.</i>

213
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:01,860
<i>Each team will be
responsible for their own gold.</i>

214
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,970
<i>Even when you win yourselves
additional gold bars</i>

215
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:07,090
<i>you need to discuss with your partner
about who will take possession of the gold</i>

216
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:10,790
<i>and make sure to keep the bars safe
with you until the final mission.</i>

217
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:16,890
[Each team putting their gold bars
in a pouch for safe keeping.]

218
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:19,610
- Did you both agree?
- Yes.

219
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:24,240
<i>Okay, everyone to their cars.</i>

220
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:28,170
[1% of friendship- The unlikely couples'
adventures are about to start.]

221
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:30,120
[Go to 'S' chicken soup restaurant.]

222
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,060
- This isn't it, right?
- No, it's in Sangshi.

223
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:33,070
Sangshi.

224
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:35,500
These two are riding with us because
neither one of them has a license.

225
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,420
- Really?
- Thank you.

226
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:43,110
Kwang Gyu looked at Ye Rim so warmly
when he greeted her earlier.

227
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:45,520
- He did?
- The way he greeted her was different.

228
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:48,760
No, that's not what happened!
It was Jung Chi who did that!

229
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:52,230
Ye Rim has become a mainstay
at our company, so everyone is...

230
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:56,740
That's right. Ye Rim is making
all the money for Jong Shin lately.

231
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:58,260
Really?

232
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,470
I'm the main bread winner for
my company too.

233
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:03,630
- You are?
- Yeah.

234
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:06,690
I guess they don't require much
to live then.

235
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:13,070
I think this is going to be
good today.

236
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,700
- Me too.
- I think it's going to be so much fun.

237
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,710
A lot of people have been calling me
an idiot these days too.

238
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:21,290
Hey!
Did you just call me an idiot?

239
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:22,830
No, that's not what I was saying.

240
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:25,040
[The subdued Idiot Couple,
Kwang and Park.]

241
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:28,460
- You pretty much just called me an idiot.
- But aren't you kind of like that?

242
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:30,530
[Hitting it on the mark?]

243
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:32,340
- Goofy.
- Goofy can be cute though.

244
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:34,560
- Yes.
- Then don't refer to yourself as an idiot.

245
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,280
- We're not idiots.
- We're not idiots.

246
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:39,150
We're just a little different from others.
That's all.

247
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:40,440
- Kwang!
- Park!

248
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,010
- Cross!
- Cross!

249
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:44,600
I really want to win.

250
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,160
I'll make sure you do.
Let's win.

251
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,700
If we don't win,
let's not even keep in touch.

252
00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:52,090
How can you say that?

253
00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:55,220
- Sa Sa.
- Yeah, Ha Ha.

254
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:59,670
- When are you going to get married?
- I want to get married within the next year.

255
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,340
- Do you have a boyfriend?
- No, I don't.

256
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:05,200
- Anyone you're interested in?
- Kim Jong Kook.

257
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:10,440
- Want me to set you up with Jong Kook?
- I need you to really make it happen.

258
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:13,720
I'll give you a tip. The type
of women that Jong Kook likes is...

259
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:17,550
He likes women who are modest,
and feminine.

260
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:20,060
You know those women who
laugh like this?

261
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:22,130
[Learning how to be modest.]

262
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:24,360
[Meanwhile...]

263
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,880
[Jong Kook is currently getting to know
another modest woman.]

264
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,390
- I heard that you're really young?
- I was born in 1994.

265
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:30,760
- '94?
- Yes.

266
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:34,460
I made my debut in '95.

267
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:37,860
[The age difference is...]

268
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:47,850
Is that it?
We're here.

269
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:53,070
- Wow... look at that. Wow.
- Wow, look at that stream.

270
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:54,480
[Refreshing water stream.]

271
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:58,480
[And in there, is a
delicious chicken soup restaurant.]

272
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,390
We're the first to arrive!

273
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:08,170
[Ha Ha and Yuri also arrive.]

274
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:10,840
Chicken soup!

275
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:14,410
- I'm so hungry.
- Me too.

276
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:17,650
[While listening to the refreshing sound
of the water in the stream...]

277
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:20,210
[Chicken soup with all its nutrients...]

278
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:24,070
[Jae Suk, Kwang Gyu,
Jung Chi and Jung In also arrive.]

279
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:28,540
I need to get out too.

280
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:30,390
I'm so sorry.

[Real life couple's
consideration for each other.]

282
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,720
What are you doing?

283
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:40,440
Let's go.

284
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:43,480
Where do we have to go?

285
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:46,210
- Go into the room.
- In our own individual rooms?

286
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:49,020
What are we going to do in the room?

287
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:50,240
[Why...]

288
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,040
- Do we have to go in there too?
- Are we all going in here together?

289
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:56,270
Really?

290
00:14:56,270 --> 00:15:00,030
[Everyone into the first room.]

291
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:02,100
- Come on in.
- We're all going in here?

292
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:04,110
- Everyone in the same room?
- What's going on in here?

293
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:06,350
Aren't we going to get our own
individual rooms?

294
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:08,430
He looks like duck restaurant owner.

295
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:11,250
[Shop owner with good humor.]

296
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:15,090
- Can we get three orders of the duck?
- Sure, whatever you want.

297
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:19,430
- Your duck...
- Your duck looks nice and plump.

298
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:24,320
[Feels like they're away
on a summer vacation...]

299

[Setting up thick mattresses
outside of their door?]

300
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:36,990
What did John Park and Kwang Soo
talk about in the car?

301
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:41,600
Even though John's very good looking,
his stare is still very much like Kwang Soo's.

302
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:46,450
[The idiot brothers?
Very similar vibe from the two...]

303
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:48,400
- He's the good looking idiot.
- And this one is the real idiot.

304
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:51,120
What?
I'm the real idiot?

305
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:54,570
[A lot of commotion going on
outside their door.]

306
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:58,550
During our drive here, Yuri and I
talked a lot about marriage.

307
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,510
We're going to pair her up with someone
in this room today.

308
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:03,050
- Are you older than me?
- Yes, I am.

309
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:05,580
I thought that Yuri was still
quite young.

310
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:07,420
I thought that she was
younger than me.

311
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:10,430
I'm being very sincere right now.
She really is a very good girl.

312

Want to share
some chicken breast together?

'Want to share
some chicken breast together?'

314
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:20,320
Want to have a protein shake together?

315

[She's trying to share interests with
health obsessed Kkuk.]

316

[The setup is now complete.]

318
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:33,190
This place is really small.

[Taking up the smallest amount of space
in the crowded room.]

320
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:40,640
- I didn't even realize that you were in here!
- I didn't even see you there!

get out there?

00:27:35,970 --> 00:27:37,570
- It's not fair to the women.
- That's right.

499
00:27:37,570 --> 00:27:38,890
Let's go!

500
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:40,720
Let's get those guys out first.

501
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:47,730
[A steamy love scene
right in front of their eyes.]

502
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:53,120
[Suk Jin and Sang Myun are eliminated!]

One more couple.
Play the music again.

505
00:28:01,870 --> 00:28:05,170
[Time to start dancing again
while keeping their eyes on each other.]

506
00:28:05,890 --> 00:28:08,210
Both of you fell out at the same time.

507
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:11,720
[The two men livening up
the couple game.]

508
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:13,040
Please move over this way.

509
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:20,610
[The room door closes.]

510
00:28:20,610 --> 00:28:22,290
Vacate the Room!

511
00:28:22,290 --> 00:28:24,930
[Concentrating their attack on
brawny Kkuk.]

512
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:27,440
[But they're pushed back!]

513
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:30,060
[A bloody battle.]

514
00:28:35,310 --> 00:28:37,910

[An impossible situation in the room...]

518
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:51,330
If Sa Yuri gets kicked out of the room,
then Gary will stay in to the next round.

519
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:54,790
[Yuri's main objective is skinship with Kkuk
instead of staying in the game?]

520
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,890
What are you guys doing?

521
00:28:59,430 --> 00:29:02,560
[Requesting a fair game between
the women?]

522
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,840
The women can duke it out
amongst themselves.

523
00:29:07,810 --> 00:29:10,020
- Ji Hyo!
- Only one of them needs to get ousted.

524
00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:11,430

themselves working together.]

I'd like to reiterate the importance of
the men needing to meet the right women.

533
00:29:50,770 --> 00:29:52,350
You're the best, Yuri!

534
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:55,300
- Ji Hyo!
- How could you have done that to Ye Rim?

535
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:56,620
[The last room is, Inkigayo Room.]

536
00:29:56,620 --> 00:30:00,070
A gold bar will be given
to the winning couple.

537
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,200
- Really?
- Yes.

538
00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:03,190
A gold bar.
This is the final round!

539
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:04,530
This is going to be a nice match.

540
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:06,570
[The start of the final round.]

541
00:30:07,930 --> 00:30:11,100
[But first, it's time to dance!]

542

[Unidentifiable dance moves.]

543
00:30:20,930 --> 00:30:24,310
[This is Kkuk's voice from
when he was in his teens!]

00:30:25,970 --> 00:30:27,890
[Already grabbing his mic?]

545
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:33,110
[Time for Kkuk's live performance!]

546
00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:34,680
It's a live performance!

547
00:30:38,650 --> 00:30:41,570
[A lively atmosphere with the original
singer of the song performing live.]

548
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:49,730
[Live performance that they haven't
seen in a very long time.]

549
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,850
[Time is up.]

550
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:02,300
Live performance!

551
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:04,940
[He's still got it.]

552

[Time to determine
who the final couple will be.]

553
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,460
We have to grab him.
Ji Hyo!

554
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:15,620
[Fierce physical battle.]

555
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:26,670
The battle going on in there
is making the sky angry.

556

[Everyone escaping the sudden downpour
under the roof overhang.]

558
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:37,850
What if my hair gets wet?

559
00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:42,670
[A bloody battle paying no attention
to the weather outside.]

560
00:31:42,670 --> 00:31:44,790
Who's it going to be?

561
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:45,860
Who is it?

562
00:31:47,130 --> 00:31:49,910
[A competition that's impossible to predict.]

563
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,950
[Blank Ji with her brute strength
lifts Ha Ha up by his leg.]

564
00:32:00,950 --> 00:32:02,500

[Ro-Ro being lifted up into the air
by their attack.]

[Moments before the fall.]

568
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:20,220

[Tenacious two couples.]

570
00:32:25,790 --> 00:32:28,740
[Ha Ha is eliminated.]

571
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:30,800
We still don't know the outcome
since Yuri is still in there.

572
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:33,260
[Now it's a two against one battle.]

573
00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:37,480
[Sa Yuri refusing with all her might.]

574
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:42,260
- She's kind of scary.
- Sorry, Yuri!

575
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:48,440
I'm sorry, Yuri!

576
00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:52,220

[Vacate the Room game-
Gary and Ji Hyo wins!]

578
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:59,650
<i>Everyone must take care of their own gold.
You're all aware of how many bars you have?</i>

579
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:03,450
<i>Okay, the first place couple can take
two of these gold bars.</i>

580
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:07,260
<i>The couple that came in at second place
gets one gold bar.</i>

581
00:33:08,530 --> 00:33:10,630
- Ha Ha, this is awesome!
- What about third place?

582
00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:12,710
Ji Hyo's going to hold onto
both the gold bars?

583
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,430
- Then Ha Ha will hold onto yours?
- Yes.

584
00:33:14,430 --> 00:33:17,990
You can find your next location in the car.
You may go onto your cars.

585
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:19,740
[Off to the next location!]

586
00:33:21,670 --> 00:33:24,770
Wow... look at this sudden weather.
It's really windy too.

587
00:33:26,790 --> 00:33:29,640
- Are you okay?
- Of course. I didn't even do anything.

588
00:33:29,650 --> 00:33:31,620
What do you mean,
you didn't do anything?

589
00:33:34,290 --> 00:33:37,620
[A fascinating conversation of
a real life couple.]

590
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:40,650
But I had you around the waist.

591
00:33:40,650 --> 00:33:43,470
- I tried to grab you, but you kept avoiding.
- You should've done a better job of leading.

592
00:33:43,470 --> 00:33:46,500
- When did I do that?
- I was trying to grab you by the waist.

593
00:33:46,510 --> 00:33:49,750
The way I see it, you two are fighting over
something that doesn't even warrant a fight.

594
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:53,110
- You were trying to avoid me.
- Should we fight too?

595
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:56,120
- You really need to get married.
- Why are you bringing that up?

596
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:59,330
[Suddenly feeling sorry
for his 47 year old friend.]

597
00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:01,500
- This is all part of our love.
- That's what I'm saying.

598
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:04,970
Are you trying to tease me?

599
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:07,890
- Seriously, Jung Chi.
- He's just speaking the truth.

600
00:34:07,890 --> 00:34:09,230
Couple Race.

601
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:12,320
- Go to 'H' swimming pool.
- H?

602
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,340
H?

603
00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:16,710
[Off to the swimming pool...]

604
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:21,400
So we now have two gold bars.

605
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,930
I know.
We're one step ahead of the others.

606
00:34:23,930 --> 00:34:25,330
That's what I'm saying.

607
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:31,680
Why are you beeping your horn at us?

608
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:35,350
Aren't you guys the owners of
a local restaurant?

609
00:34:35,350 --> 00:34:38,020
- Huh? Aren't you restaurant owners?
- Yes, we are.

610
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:40,630

- Is it the four of you?
- Yes.

614
00:34:45,890 --> 00:34:47,910
Four!
We've got four customers.

[The rain continuing to pour down.]

616
00:34:53,770 --> 00:34:57,580
[The point of their arrival is,
a pool at a traditional style pension.]

617
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,540
- What is this? This is scaring me.
- What is with the water guns?

618
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:05,390
Why are they holding those water guns?

619
00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:07,030
- What is that?
- Water guns.

620
00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:10,600
We're here on our honeymoon.

621
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:13,190
[Looks like they're here on
a group honeymoon?]

622
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:14,980
[Then is this a filial trip for his father?]

623
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:18,520
He hasn't been out in a while,
and he's enjoying all the fresh air.

624
00:35:22,110 --> 00:35:25,110
- The sky looks so clear.
- Doesn't it?

625
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:29,280
When you tilt your head back like that...
all the light reflects off your head.

626
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:31,550
That's not completely untrue either.

627
00:35:31,550 --> 00:35:34,040
Duck shop owner,
do you have a death wish?

628
00:35:36,830 --> 00:35:39,130
- Seriously!
- Calm down over there.

629
00:35:39,130 --> 00:35:42,620
When the lightening struck earlier
we all jumped.

630
00:35:49,210 --> 00:35:51,520
John Park, did you understand
this whole exchange just now?

631
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:54,400
Yes.
I'm not that dumb.

632
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:57,860
- He wasn't calling you dumb.
- That's not what I meant.

633
00:35:57,870 --> 00:35:59,560
Make him understand, Kwang Soo.

634
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:02,020
Explain to him what I was
trying to say.

635
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:05,220
<i>Your next game is,

teams in an 'all-kill' move wins the game.</i>

640

- Which couple won the last game?
- We did.

641
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:28,970
<i>Kang Gary and Song Ji Hyo can name
the first two couples to start off the game.</i>

642
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:32,870
- But going first isn't always good.
- Hope it's not us.

643
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:36,130
You have to get rid of all the strong teams
in the beginning to make it easier later.

644
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:40,340
We want Jae Suk and Kwang Gyu
to go up against Suk Jin and Sang Myun.

645
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:41,730
We just have to eliminate them.

646
00:36:43,610 --> 00:36:45,300
We have to eliminate them
from this game.

What should we go with?

650
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:54,490
- What?
- What should we use?

651
00:36:54,490 --> 00:36:56,040
Shiny bald head!

652
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:01,180
It's cute.

- Sparkle.
- How about 'Sparkle'?

655
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:06,410
- Okay, we'll go with 'sparkle'.
- Sparkle?

656
00:37:06,410 --> 00:37:08,780
- We'll go with 'Quack Quack'.
- Let's just stick with Kwang-Gyu!

657
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:12,480
- But people don't really know my name yet.
- What are you talking about?

658
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,810
- Why are you getting so worked up?
- What do you mean, your name is unknown?

659
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:16,410
I'm telling you that
people don't know my name!

660
00:37:16,410 --> 00:37:18,520
- Okay, we'll go with Kwang-Gyu.
- Let's go with Kwang-Gyu.

661
00:37:18,790 --> 00:37:21,610

'What are you doing, Father.'

662
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:25,650
[How absurd...]

663
00:37:25,650 --> 00:37:27,250
- Are we going to go with Quack-Quack?
- Yeah, I like that.

664
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:28,880
Here's your first question.

665
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,330
We're going to do this.

666
00:37:30,330 --> 00:37:32,970
- This is a friendship question.
- Friendship question?

667
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:35,940
You're all familiar with
the painter, Lee Jong Sup, right?

668
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:37,120
- Yes, of course!
- Yes, I do.

669
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:42,140
- Don't say anything out loud.
- It's a bull, not a cow.

670
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:45,130
- I love his paintings.
- It's not Lee Jung Sup?

671
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:51,380
- Isn't Lee Jung Sup a singer?
- No, that's Lee Jung Suk.

672
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:52,510
[That's singer, Lee Jung Suk.]

673
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,020
If this is how it's going to be,
then I'm pretty confident in this game.

674
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:59,060
The way I see it,
we're going to beat these two.

675
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:01,980
- Once these two are gone, it's all over.
- Okay, the painter, Lee Jong Sup.

676
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:04,810
When his friend was hospitalized

677
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:09,410
he had no money to help him out,
so he painted this as a gift instead.

678
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:12,920
- Which painting is this referring to?
- Lee Jung Sop painted it as a gift?

679
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:14,670
When his friend was hospitalized?

680
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:16,530
- Can we be the one to shoot them?
- Would you like to?

681
00:38:16,530 --> 00:38:18,880
- Can we shoot them ourselves?
- Why are you doing that?

682
00:38:21,130 --> 00:38:23,660
Ye Rim was so excited by the idea
that she ran over here to take her seat.

683
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:24,730
[Trading out with other shooters.]

684
00:38:24,730 --> 00:38:26,040
Kwang-Gyu!

685
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,820
Rice!
He painted, rice!

686
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:34,810
[Shot in the face with the water gun.]

687
00:38:35,410 --> 00:38:37,660
[Relentless water shower in the face.]

688
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:43,590
I'm too scared of the water gun
to even play this game.

689
00:38:43,590 --> 00:38:45,840
- Don't answer too rashly.
- Quack-Quack.

690
00:38:47,310 --> 00:38:48,460
Orange.

691
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:54,890
[The water gun bringing
huge laughter to the group.]

692
00:39:00,470 --> 00:39:02,630
[The correct answer is, nectarine.]

693
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:06,400
Kwang-Gyu!

694
00:39:06,830 --> 00:39:08,050
Apple.

695
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:14,060
[Firing down upon him for the
wrong answer.]

696
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:20,310
[Firing directly at the shiny Kyung Gyu.]

697
00:39:22,290 --> 00:39:24,030
- Wow, they're so cruel.
- Kwang-Gyu!

698
00:39:24,450 --> 00:39:25,400
[Back to the Kwang-Gyu team.]

699
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:26,940
- Apple!
- I just said that!

700
00:39:28,310 --> 00:39:29,800
I just said that!

701
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:33,560
Quack-Quack!
Grapes!

702
00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:37,470
Kwang-Gyu!
Mackerel!

703
00:39:38,610 --> 00:39:39,670
Mackerel!

704
00:39:41,470 --> 00:39:43,350
Quack-Quack!
Melon!

705
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:47,950
[Not a melon...]

706
00:39:47,950 --> 00:39:50,500
Kwang-Gyu!
Orange!

707
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:52,150
They said that earlier!

708
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:55,220
- Kwang-Gyu!
- What else is there?

709
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:57,570
- It's a three letter word.
- Kwang-Gyu!

710
00:39:57,570 --> 00:39:58,750
Figs.

711
00:39:58,750 --> 00:40:00,650
- Fig.
- How would he have eaten a fig?

712
00:40:00,650 --> 00:40:03,030
- Quack-Quack!
- Quack-Quack!

713
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:05,720
- Let's discuss it first.
- I'm sure it was a rare food item.

714
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:08,450
- Guava.
- They already said that.

715
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:15,030
Kwang-Gyu!
Peach!

716
00:40:15,430 --> 00:40:17,420
- Peach!
- That's right.

717
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:19,340
It's peach.

718
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:20,880
- Is it?
- Why didn't I think of that?

719
00:40:21,570 --> 00:40:23,370
[Correct answer]

720
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:30,300
[Team Kwang-Gyu answers
the first question correctly.]

721
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:33,010
- I didn't know that.
- A three letter fruit.

722
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:39,300
We would like to choose...
Lee Kwang Soo and John Park.

723
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:43,860
[Ha Ha and Sa Yuri vs.
Lee Kwang Soo and John Park.]

724
00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:46,380
We have to do this for real.

725
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:49,080
[Time to reveal the skills of the
Idiot Brothers.]

726
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:51,380
<i>This is a love question.</i>

727
00:40:51,730 --> 00:40:57,360
<i>In Europe, allowing women to
touch this...</i>

728
00:41:01,270 --> 00:41:04,750
<i>Allowing women to touch this...</i>

729
00:41:05,730 --> 00:41:09,840
[What are you thinking about?]

730
00:41:10,270 --> 00:41:13,250
I'm sorry!

731
00:41:14,570 --> 00:41:16,460
- I'm sorry.
- In Europe...

732
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:21,450
<i>Allowing women to touch this
is an expression of love...</i>

733
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:25,150
[It's all your fault.]

734
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:28,780
[This is all Kwang Soo's fault?]

735
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:33,460
[What are they all thinking about?]

736
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:36,320
- You need to get your head on straight!
- What is he thinking about?

737
00:41:37,710 --> 00:41:39,090
- Get your head on straight!
- Okay, I'm good.

738
00:41:40,290 --> 00:41:42,180
What's the question again?

739
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:49,600
<i>That is the question. What are women allowed
to touch in Europe as an expression of love?</i>

740
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:51,730
Sa-Ha!
Nose!

741
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:55,420
Kwang-Park!
Armpit!

742
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:58,160
- Why would they touch the armpit?
- Sa-Ha!

743
00:41:58,670 --> 00:41:59,850
Hair strands?

744
00:42:02,910 --> 00:42:04,740
- Don't you even know the answer?
- Sa-Ha!

745
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:06,150
Nostril?

746
00:42:09,090 --> 00:42:10,890
Kwang-Park.
Bottom of the foot.

747
00:42:10,890 --> 00:42:12,810
Why are all the answers so dirty?

748
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:16,150
- Can you give us a hint?
- Here's your hint.

749
00:42:16,150 --> 00:42:17,990
I told you that it's related to
Greece, right?

750
00:42:17,990 --> 00:42:22,830
When you think of a Greek mythology,
what is the one symbol of masculinity?

751
00:42:22,830 --> 00:42:23,930
- Sa-Ha!
- Kwang-Park!

752
00:42:23,970 --> 00:42:26,970
- Kwang-Park was quicker.
- I was faster!

753
00:42:27,730 --> 00:42:29,010
Beard.

754
00:42:30,230 --> 00:42:32,410
[Correct answer]

755
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:38,440
- We got it.
- We're good.

756
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:40,230
Who's up next?

757
00:42:40,230 --> 00:42:43,870
[Kwang-Park couple on fire-
They beat Jong Kook and Ye Rim as well.]

758
00:42:43,870 --> 00:42:45,870
- Kang Gary and Song Ji Hyo!
- There you go.

759
00:42:45,870 --> 00:42:47,800
[They choose Kang Gary and Song Ji Hyo
as their next opponents.]

760
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:53,170
Give us a lot of love questions
since Kang Gary is so full of love.

761
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:56,300
[Because Gary is an expert in love?]

762
00:42:56,810 --> 00:43:00,770
With the meaning, 'Can't forget
whether asleep or awake'...

763
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:03,450
- Is it a four character idiom?
- Yes, it is.

764
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:10,060
What is the idiom that is often used to
describe the longing one feels for another?

765
00:43:10,060 --> 00:43:12,290
- You have to think carefully about this.
- Monday.

766
00:43:12,290 --> 00:43:13,820
What is it?

767
00:43:14,270 --> 00:43:15,340
Blank-Gae!

768
00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:16,680
Oh-Ri-Mu-Jong.

769
00:43:21,830 --> 00:43:24,910
Why? A man could be totally
intoxicated with a woman.

770
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:29,730
- This is heard in sageuks a lot.
- Blank-Gae.

771
00:43:29,730 --> 00:43:31,200
Bul-Chul-Joo-Ya?

772
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:36,250
Think about sageuks and what they say.

773
00:43:36,250 --> 00:43:37,970
When they describe a young maiden.

774
00:43:38,870 --> 00:43:39,940
Blank-Gae!

775
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:42,150
Oh-mae-bul-bak.

776
00:43:42,710 --> 00:43:45,760
[Is he right?]

777
00:43:47,150 --> 00:43:49,980
No, no!
You have to listen to it again.

778
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:51,560
- What did you say?
- Say it again.

779
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:54,840
- Say it one syllable at a time.
- It's already in the past.

780
00:43:56,220 --> 00:43:57,640
- Say it again!
- Say your answer again.

781
00:43:57,640 --> 00:43:59,460
Oh-mae-bul-bang.

782
00:44:00,110 --> 00:44:02,460
[Bul-bang?]

783
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:07,820
Kwang-Park!
Oh-mae-bul-mang!

784
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:11,110
[Correct answer]

785
00:44:15,290 --> 00:44:16,990
- Oh-mae-bul-bang?
- Ah... Oh-mae-bul-bang!

786
00:44:18,220 --> 00:44:20,160
Oh my... bul-bang?
(bul-bang=Fiery room)

787
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:21,760
So the room's on fire?

788
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:22,870
[Almost had it.]

789
00:44:22,870 --> 00:44:24,810
What is with you today, Kwang Soo?
You and John Park.

790
00:44:24,810 --> 00:44:28,390
- What's with the Idiot Brothers?
- We're not the Idiot Brothers.

791
00:44:28,830 --> 00:44:31,500
Our last couple,
the Jung-Jung couple!

792
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:34,520
- This is the final round.
- Final round.

793
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:37,590
I'd feel bad if we win this whole thing
just for beating one team.

794
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:40,240
What does it matter?
You just need to worry about winning.

795
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:42,170
Just think of winning, Jung Chi.

796
00:44:42,170 --> 00:44:45,540
Then if they just win this round,
they win this whole game?

797
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:47,870
Kwang Gyu, is the sun bothering you?

798
00:44:47,870 --> 00:44:49,200
- What?
- Are you dizzy?

799
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:52,080
- I think I ate too much, because I'm sleepy.
- Really?

800
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:54,990
I have food coma.

801
00:44:56,060 --> 00:44:58,540
This is going to be a very
easy question.

802
00:44:58,540 --> 00:44:59,930
I'm nervous.

803
00:45:00,190 --> 00:45:05,070
Because of all the camaraderie that they've
shared since they were little kids

804
00:45:05,390 --> 00:45:10,710
this person left many anecdotes that are still
remembered to this day. Who is this person?

805
00:45:10,950 --> 00:45:12,920
- I know this one.
- Jung Jung!

806
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:14,950
Oh Sung and Han Eum?

807
00:45:15,820 --> 00:45:18,250
[Correct answer]

808
00:45:18,730 --> 00:45:21,730
[Gets the right answer in one shot!]

809
00:45:23,730 --> 00:45:25,570
This is the quiz diva!

810
00:45:25,570 --> 00:45:29,160
- This is the quiz diva.
- I can't believe she got it in one shot.

811
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:31,120
This is a survey question.

812
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:33,480
[Next up is a survey question.]

813
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:39,140
One hundred questions were asked to college
students in this recent TV program.

814
00:45:39,490 --> 00:45:43,520
What is the one song that they hate to
hear the most being sung at a karaoke bar?

815
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:45,540
- I know this one.
- Kwang-Park.

816
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:47,150
You know the song, right?

817
00:45:47,150 --> 00:45:49,310
- It's a two letter word.
- She's gone?

818
00:45:51,220 --> 00:45:54,220
[Have to listen to the whole question.]

819
00:46:00,550 --> 00:46:03,050
[Jung Chi getting a feeling from
the shot of water to his face?]

820
00:46:03,050 --> 00:46:05,150
Jung Chi looks so ugly when the water
is being sprayed at him.

821
00:46:08,350 --> 00:46:14,840
The number one song that the women hated
the most is, 'Confession' by Im Jae Bum.

822
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:16,500
- Yes, that's it.
- It's 'Confession'.

823
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:20,810
What is the one song that male students
hated hearing the most by the female students?

824
00:46:20,810 --> 00:46:22,470
- I know this!
- Kwang-Park!

825
00:46:22,470 --> 00:46:25,100
'I like strawberries'
by Pippi long stocking?

826
00:46:29,170 --> 00:46:31,800
But... I actually agree with
him on that.

827
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:34,770
I like strawberries!
Berries, berries!

828
00:46:34,770 --> 00:46:39,710
[Agreed that this song should
never be repeated.]

829
00:46:39,710 --> 00:46:41,840
Lee So Ra loves to sing that song.

830
00:46:42,060 --> 00:46:44,500
- I hate hearing that song.
- 'Gee' by Girls Generation?

831
00:46:50,350 --> 00:46:52,450
- Don't you hate seeing that?
- Why would I hate seeing that?

832
00:46:53,030 --> 00:46:55,500
If that's the way they look,
then it really may be a hateful sight...]

833
00:46:59,380 --> 00:47:01,140
Why are you such a good shot?

834
00:47:02,710 --> 00:47:03,960
Jung Jung.

835
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:06,420
Sistar's 'Now that you're gone'?

836
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:09,990
- Sing it for us.
- It's all the songs that you like.

837
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:12,970
What's wrong with him?
What's he doing?

838
00:47:12,970 --> 00:47:14,590
[Giving a physical demonstration.]

839
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:16,470
Why are you doing that to me?
Stop it.

840
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:20,010
- She doesn't like to see it.
- I think it's a girl group song.

841
00:47:20,010 --> 00:47:21,820
Kwang-Park.
IU's 'It's a good day'.

842
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:25,130
I bet that's it.

843
00:47:25,140 --> 00:47:27,200
- Is that it?
- I bet that's it.

844

[Correct answer]

845
00:47:30,130 --> 00:47:31,720
We did it!

846
00:47:32,570 --> 00:47:35,670
[All the ladies, please refrain yourselves
from singing that song.]

847
00:47:35,670 --> 00:47:37,910
- This is the final question?
- Everything's riding on this.

848
00:47:37,910 --> 00:47:39,060
[The final question where
the victory is on the line.]

849
00:47:39,060 --> 00:47:41,600
We'll show everyone how good we are.

850
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:44,250
I will show everyone!

851
00:47:44,260 --> 00:47:46,050
- Here's your question.
- The final question.

852
00:47:47,060 --> 00:47:50,170
A novel based on friendship.

853
00:47:50,180 --> 00:47:52,800
In the book,
'My lime orange tree'...

854
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:54,820
I think I'm going to know this.

855
00:47:54,820 --> 00:47:57,430
What is the name of the main character
in this book?

856
00:47:58,470 --> 00:48:00,200
Kwang-Park!
Thomas.

857
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:02,640
Jung Jung!
Jerome?

858
00:48:02,670 --> 00:48:03,870
Jerome?

859
00:48:06,890 --> 00:48:08,940
Jung Jung.
Jonas?

860
00:48:10,660 --> 00:48:12,580
I thought I've heard of that name before.

861
00:48:12,580 --> 00:48:15,710
- What is it?
- That's not the name, is it?

862
00:48:15,710 --> 00:48:18,050
It's a Brazilian name.

863
00:48:18,050 --> 00:48:20,040
It's Brazilian.

864
00:48:20,450 --> 00:48:21,770
Jung Jung.

865
00:48:21,770 --> 00:48:23,490
Jiko?

866
00:48:24,050 --> 00:48:27,480
[That's the name of
a Brazilian soccer player.]

867
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:28,590
He must really like soccer.

868
00:48:28,590 --> 00:48:31,290
- I really like soccer too.
- I don't know any other names.

869
00:48:31,690 --> 00:48:33,280
Kwang-Park!
ZeZe?

870
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:35,600
ZeZe!

[Correct answer]

872
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:47,520
I got up to the first part
of the name.

873

[The Idiot Brothers beat them all...]

874
00:48:53,210 --> 00:48:55,010
The Idiot Brothers won?

875
00:48:55,010 --> 00:48:56,700
We're the smartest ones here!

876
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:58,480
You guys are all idiots!

877

[Jung Chi and Jung In win one gold bar
for coming in at second place.]

878
00:49:03,860 --> 00:49:05,940
- This is for the first place winners.
- They get two? Wow...

879
00:49:05,940 --> 00:49:07,980
- We have to decide who'll keep this?
- Yes, you must decide.

880
00:49:07,980 --> 00:49:09,030
You have to think carefully about it.

881
00:49:09,030 --> 00:49:12,530
I'm sorry, but Ye Rim lost her gold.

882
00:49:12,590 --> 00:49:16,710
[Jong Kook and Ye Rim's gold bar
is missing?]

883
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:20,750
She said she left it there earlier,
but now it's gone.

884
00:49:21,370 --> 00:49:23,130
You never know.
Someone could've taken it.

885
00:49:23,130 --> 00:49:25,580
[Did someone steal it?]

886
00:49:27,410 --> 00:49:30,410
[Paying more attention to the
safe keeping of their gold.]

887
00:49:31,010 --> 00:49:33,440
- You didn't have any gold earlier.
- Yes, I did.

888
00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:36,320
Decide who's going to keep it,
and off to the next location.

the vanished gold will be revealed.]

[And ten minutes later,
the sun starts to blaze again.]

892
00:49:50,810 --> 00:49:54,060
[Raining and not raining...
very strange weather.]

893
00:49:54,060 --> 00:49:55,930
It is said that a tiger and a fox
get married on days like this.

894
00:49:55,930 --> 00:49:58,290
Then that would mean that I'm
the one getting married?

895
00:49:59,210 --> 00:50:00,820
What is this?

896
00:50:00,950 --> 00:50:02,810

<i>We looked everywhere for it,
and it's really gone.</i>

898

- Ye Rim lost it.
- If you lose it, then that's it.

899
00:50:07,070 --> 00:50:08,600
<i>It's really gone.
I told you earlier, didn't I?</i>

900
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:10,470

take care of the gold for you.</i>

901
00:50:10,470 --> 00:50:13,980

somewhere, and no one saw it.</i>

00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:23,710
- When we were shooting the water gun earlier...
- That's where you lost it?

906
00:50:23,710 --> 00:50:25,570
- Where did you put it down?
- Right where I was sitting.

907
00:50:25,570 --> 00:50:27,140
Who sat down in our seat after us?

908
00:50:27,140 --> 00:50:28,610

[Then that would mean that
Haroro took the gold bar?]

911
00:50:36,940 --> 00:50:39,720
That's not what I mean,
but I'm sure that he stole the bar.

912
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:41,420
What do mean, I stole it?

913
00:50:41,420 --> 00:50:43,860
We each had one before we even
started playing the game.

914
00:50:43,860 --> 00:50:46,770
- No, you didn't.
- We won one at the last game.

915
00:50:46,770 --> 00:50:49,330
It could be a ploy by Ye Rim too.

916
00:50:49,940 --> 00:50:51,460
Ye Rim could be playing us.

917
00:50:51,460 --> 00:50:53,650
- Do we need to go back to the courtroom?
- Let's take this to court.

918
00:50:53,650 --> 00:50:56,670
- Which one of you took it?
- Since I'm a judge...

[Acting as the Judge from
'I Hear Your Voice'?]

920

Come on, seriously.

922
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:07,190
- What's wrong with you?
- He played a judge in a recent drama.

923
00:51:07,190 --> 00:51:09,810
You need to be more cautious
with your own gold.

924
00:51:09,810 --> 00:51:12,100
Since this is already water under the bridge,
let's just forget about it.

925
00:51:12,100 --> 00:51:14,480
- He's acting suspiciously.
- It's you. Give it back.

926
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:17,230
- How many bars do you have?
- It really isn't me.

927

But it's time to start the game.]

the couple games.</i>

peculiar couple mission.</i>

932

Peculiar mission?
That sounds like fun.

[This was a real mission that was played
in a world competition.]

934

<i>Do you see the boxes that
are behind you?</i>

935
00:51:36,090 --> 00:51:38,370

- Touch the stomach?

make your boats.</i>

940
00:51:55,540 --> 00:51:59,940
<i>The first team to arrive at the finish line
will be the winners of this mission.</i>

You have to get to the line in the boat?
Both of us?

942
00:52:02,580 --> 00:52:04,870
- Both of you.
- He's going to sink our boat.

943
00:52:05,210 --> 00:52:06,980
- It's more than possible to do it.
- It's possible?

944
00:52:06,980 --> 00:52:09,650
- A boat out of those cardboard boxes?
- This is what we make it out of?

945
00:52:09,650 --> 00:52:10,950

946
00:52:10,950 --> 00:52:15,430

it'll be a cinch.</i>

that you see behind you.</i>

949
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:22,330
<i>You don't necessarily need to
make it in that shape.</i>

[Make a rowboat by utilizing the
cardboard box, tape and saran wrap.]

951
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:27,930
- Okay, let's get started.
- You've got 30 minutes.

952

[Time to make the cardboard boats!]

953
00:52:32,790 --> 00:52:34,560
It doesn't have to look like that boat.

954
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:37,470
- No, it doesn't.
- It just has to get us to the finish line.

955
00:52:37,470 --> 00:52:38,700
That's right.

956

- Come on.
- I don't know if I can do this.

You're good at things like this.
Running Man has high standards.

960
00:52:52,350 --> 00:52:54,990
I noticed that Running Man tends to be
pretty scientific.

961
00:52:56,520 --> 00:52:59,100
- We have to do a good job with the cutting.
- The cutting?

962

[Jung Chi being meticulous with the cutting
by using the ruler and the blade.]

963
00:53:03,910 --> 00:53:06,800
Even if we can't make it that well,
let's at least try to appear smart.

964

[A smart looking boat?]

965
00:53:09,270 --> 00:53:10,890
Even if it doesn't float.

966
00:53:11,530 --> 00:53:17,350
[Meanwhile, Jong Kook and Ye Rim's box
is already starting to look like a boat.]

967
00:53:17,350 --> 00:53:19,210
Yes, the boat bottoms are very taut.

968
00:53:19,210 --> 00:53:23,180
In that case, I think we need to angle it
instead of making it look too boxy.

969
00:53:23,180 --> 00:53:27,110
[Mr. Capable moving right along
and building the boat as expected.]

970
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:30,100
Wow, look at that.

971
00:53:30,100 --> 00:53:31,720
Awesome!

972
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:33,540
- Isn't he good?
- What the heck?

973
00:53:33,540 --> 00:53:36,660
- Come on, Yuri.
- Let's trade teams.

974
00:53:36,850 --> 00:53:39,600
You go over there.
I want to ride on this boat with Jong Kook.

975

Why isn't this sticking?

980
00:54:01,580 --> 00:54:05,100
[That's because you didn't
stick it on right.]

981
00:54:05,930 --> 00:54:07,790
We're going to have to wrap this around.

982
00:54:07,790 --> 00:54:11,840
[The quiz winners who no longer
have anything left to say.]

983
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,580
We have to secure this somehow.

984
00:54:15,820 --> 00:54:17,460
Should we just wing it?

985
00:54:18,790 --> 00:54:20,310
Why isn't this sticking?

[Will these guys be able to complete
it on time?]

[What kind of a boat
will the Monday Couple come up with?]

988
00:54:30,670 --> 00:54:32,300
Should we build it like a raft?

989
00:54:33,750 --> 00:54:35,100
Like a raft?

990
00:54:35,100 --> 00:54:38,180
- We can cut it up and make it thick.
- Really thick?

991
00:54:38,180 --> 00:54:40,880
That's not bad.
That's not a bad idea.

992
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:43,370
We can build it like a raft.
So we agree, right?

993
00:54:43,370 --> 00:54:45,030
- Okay, let's do it.
- You can't change your mind, okay?

994
00:54:45,030 --> 00:54:47,150
[Monday Couple agrees to build
their boat like a raft.]

995
00:54:48,020 --> 00:54:51,960
[Planning on twining the boards together
like they would with wood pillars.]

996
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:54,510
- Let's put the bigger pieces on the bottom.
- That's right! My Ji Hyo is so smart!

997
00:54:54,510 --> 00:54:56,200
[Monday Couple working in sync.]

998
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:58,260
If you break it apart like that,
it's going to leak.

999
00:54:58,260 --> 00:54:59,830
- Why would it leak?
- You don't think it'll leak?

1000
00:54:59,830 --> 00:55:01,860
- No.
- We'll take care of it ourselves.

1001
00:55:01,860 --> 00:55:04,000
- We know what we're doing.
- You're building it like a raft?

1002
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,040
No, we're not.

1003
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:06,980
Don't you think raft is a pretty good idea?

1004
00:55:06,980 --> 00:55:10,070
- What are you doing?
- Why are you copying our idea?

1005
00:55:10,390 --> 00:55:13,050
The most important thing is to make sure
that it's built really sturdy.

1006
00:55:13,060 --> 00:55:17,620
Let's make it really strong.
We have to show them what we're made of.

1007
00:55:17,620 --> 00:55:20,740
[Taping up the boat very securely first.]

1008
00:55:22,050 --> 00:55:24,930
How about we leave it like this for the back
and angle it a bit for the front?

1009
00:55:24,940 --> 00:55:29,320
I don't think there's a single person here
who knows how to make this.

1010
00:55:29,900 --> 00:55:31,770
Is this even going to float?

1011
00:55:31,770 --> 00:55:35,080
[Taping it over and over to make sure
that the boat is built strong.]

1012
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:37,150
You think the two of you can ride
in this little thing?

1013
00:55:37,150 --> 00:55:39,700
Of course.
Why wouldn't we be able to?

1014
00:55:39,700 --> 00:55:40,920
[It doesn't seem very feasible...]

1015
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:43,300
- This is just our foundation.
- You have to cut a bit more here.

1016
00:55:43,300 --> 00:55:45,160
[No way...]

1017
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:47,720
We have to block this over here.
Let's tape it real well.

1018
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:50,130
Want to tape up this whole thing
and cut a big hole over here?

1019
00:55:50,130 --> 00:55:51,290
Okay.

1020
00:55:51,330 --> 00:55:54,000
And we can add that box on
and have it shaped like a car.

1021
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,390
- Okay! Deal!
- Deal!

1022
00:55:55,390 --> 00:55:57,200
- Okay, we got it.
- Were going to win this.

1023
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:58,350
- We're going to win it.
- We're going to win it.

1024
00:55:59,170 --> 00:56:03,370
- We have to tape it really well.
- We're going to have to tape the whole thing.

1025
00:56:04,150 --> 00:56:07,080
[And the one team who doesn't even
have an idea of what to do yet.]

1026
00:56:07,580 --> 00:56:10,440
What is this supposed to be?
A refrigerator box?

1027
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:12,290
Seriously.

1028
00:56:12,290 --> 00:56:14,340
First, we're going to have to
block this end off.

1029
00:56:14,340 --> 00:56:16,050
[Kwang Gyu suggesting that they build
the frame of the boat first.]

1030
00:56:16,050 --> 00:56:18,960
[And Jae Suk suggesting that they make
sure the boat won't leak first.]

1031
00:56:20,090 --> 00:56:23,620
[No matter what is said, Jae Suk is too
afraid of the boat leaking and sinking.]

1032
00:56:23,930 --> 00:56:25,670
- That's just a waste.
- Just stick these two together first.

1033
00:56:25,670 --> 00:56:28,030
- That's just a waste.
- This is falling apart.

1034
00:56:28,030 --> 00:56:31,490
[The two men thinking in
two totally different directions.]

1035
00:56:35,220 --> 00:56:36,660
That really hurt!

1036
00:56:38,470 --> 00:56:40,620
Why are you so weak, Kyung Gyu?

1037
00:56:40,620 --> 00:56:42,240
Here, I got it.

1038
00:56:43,370 --> 00:56:45,800
Let's pull this up, and tape it together.

1039
00:56:47,930 --> 00:56:51,790
[The two men with the least
bit of progress made.]

1040
00:56:52,550 --> 00:56:54,370
- From the way I see it..
- Yeah?

1041
00:56:54,370 --> 00:56:57,260
- I'm betting 100% that it's going to sink.
- No, it's not going to sink.

1042
00:56:57,270 --> 00:56:58,830
- It's going to sink.
- No, it's not.

1043
00:56:58,830 --> 00:57:00,080
[Will it?]

1044
00:57:00,780 --> 00:57:03,130
[In 30 minutes.]

1045
00:57:04,180 --> 00:57:07,980
[Will their boat float in water?]

1046
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:13,690
[So meticulous!
Jung Chi is still measuring and cutting.]

1047
00:57:13,690 --> 00:57:15,130
Just wing it.

1048
00:57:19,190 --> 00:57:21,950
We're the only team using
a ruler right now.

1049
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:25,610
Looking cool on the water is important.
The speed doesn't really matter.

1050
00:57:26,740 --> 00:57:29,660
[Jung Chi and Jung In with two
extremely different personalities.]

1051
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:33,180
[They just need to fold it now.]

1052
00:57:33,180 --> 00:57:35,410
I'll do it, I'll do it.
I think I can do it with my knees.

1053
00:57:35,410 --> 00:57:37,140
See?
It worked.

1054
00:57:39,860 --> 00:57:42,450
- But you made it crooked!
- That's no big deal.

1055
00:57:42,450 --> 00:57:44,170
We can't have this.

1056
00:57:44,840 --> 00:57:47,840
[Taking on the shape of a boat.]

1057
00:57:48,850 --> 00:57:52,400
We need to do it like them.
Theirs is starting to look like a boat.

1058
00:57:53,460 --> 00:57:56,200
- Theirs is looking good.
- You have to be mindful of the design.

1059
00:57:56,200 --> 00:57:58,790
- That's pretty good.
- Don't look!

1060
00:57:58,790 --> 00:58:00,160
Okay, I won't.

1061
00:58:00,740 --> 00:58:04,800
[Very protective about keeping the
secrecy of his own project.]

1062
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:06,260
They're like corporate spies.

1063
00:58:06,260 --> 00:58:08,160
What do you mean, corporate spies?

1064
00:58:09,290 --> 00:58:11,560
It must be nice for Jung In to
have Jung Chi.

1065
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:14,360
- To have such a dependable boyfriend.
- You think?

1066
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,260
Right?

1067
00:58:16,950 --> 00:58:18,730
- Kwang Soo!
- Yes, Jae Suk?

1068
00:58:18,730 --> 00:58:21,070
- I guarantee that yours will sink.
- No, it won't.

1069
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:23,750
Did you guys build a bookshelf?

1070
00:58:23,750 --> 00:58:25,310
- It's not a bookshelf.
- This is a bookshelf.

1071
00:58:25,310 --> 00:58:27,020
[At a close look, it does look like a
dining table/bookshelf?]

1072
00:58:27,020 --> 00:58:28,990
- Then is it a dining table?
- No, it's not a dining table.

1073
00:58:28,990 --> 00:58:31,010
Is this where you eat your meals?

1074
00:58:31,430 --> 00:58:33,740
[What will this turn out to be?]

1075
00:58:37,190 --> 00:58:40,220
You're doing great!
Look at you go!

1076
00:58:40,230 --> 00:58:43,030
[Making the boxy boat sturdy by
wrapping the whole thing in tape.]

1077
00:58:43,030 --> 00:58:45,880
There you go.
You're doing great.

1078
00:58:45,890 --> 00:58:48,170
- Wrap it.
- Just wrap it?

1079
00:58:48,180 --> 00:58:49,590
Keep wrapping it.

1080
00:58:49,590 --> 00:58:51,360
Wrap it around like 50 times.

1081
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:56,980
[Now wrapping it up. Not wanting
a single drop of water to get in.]

1082
00:58:56,980 --> 00:58:58,320
Let's just wrap the whole thing.

1083
00:58:58,320 --> 00:59:00,220
Keep wrapping it until the time is up.

1084
00:59:04,020 --> 00:59:06,900
[Their boat really is looking too small.]

1085
00:59:08,080 --> 00:59:10,900
You can ride in that one, and I'll
make another space for me to ride in

1086
00:59:10,900 --> 00:59:12,520
and we can just connect
the two parts together.

1087
00:59:12,530 --> 00:59:14,600
- Don't you think? This could work.
- Okay.

1088
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:18,250
[Sang Myun in the big box,
and Suk Jin in the little box.]

1089
00:59:19,340 --> 00:59:23,460
[Time to begin building Suk Jin's box.]

1090
00:59:30,770 --> 00:59:32,670
- Should I try going in there?
- Get in there.

1091
00:59:41,700 --> 00:59:43,160
I think we're good.

1092
00:59:43,160 --> 00:59:44,580
There you go.

1093
00:59:44,580 --> 00:59:48,140
[Gary and Ji Hyo are wrapping up all their
boxes together in a raft style.]

1094
00:59:48,140 --> 00:59:49,680
Here it comes.

1095
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:51,510
[Every move they make is in
perfect harmony.]

1096
00:59:51,510 --> 00:59:54,530
[Monday Couple- three years in the making.]

1097
00:59:54,530 --> 00:59:55,830
That's good.

1098
00:59:59,790 --> 01:00:01,140
- I'm so sorry.
- No, it's okay.

1099
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:04,770
I think this is pretty good.
Let's try getting on it.

1100
01:00:04,770 --> 01:00:06,140
[First couple to complete their boat.]

1101
01:00:08,260 --> 01:00:10,460
- Doesn't it feel safe?
- It does feel safe.

1102
01:00:11,850 --> 01:00:13,800
- Be careful, Jung In.
- What?

1103
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:15,290
- Be careful, okay?
- Okay.

1104
01:00:19,490 --> 01:00:20,780
That hurts.

1105
01:00:20,780 --> 01:00:22,490
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

1106
01:00:26,840 --> 01:00:28,280
Be careful.

1107
01:00:28,280 --> 01:00:30,330
That knife scares me.

1108
01:00:32,060 --> 01:00:33,520
- You okay?
- What?

1109
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:36,870
- Wear my gloves.
- No, it's okay.

1110
01:00:38,060 --> 01:00:40,280
- Is your head okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

1111
01:00:40,280 --> 01:00:43,200
You guys really care for each other.

1112
01:00:44,630 --> 01:00:45,820
Seriously.

1113
01:00:45,820 --> 01:00:49,010
We just need to coat this thing
now, okay?

1114
01:00:49,960 --> 01:00:51,400
Why aren't you answering me?
Okay?

1115
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,340
What do you mean, okay?
This thing looks like it's going to sink.

1116
01:00:54,350 --> 01:00:55,700
It's not going to sink.

1117
01:00:55,890 --> 01:00:58,430
[Seemingly happy with how it looks.]

1118
01:00:58,430 --> 01:01:01,600
- We need to tape the insides.
- We need to finish the outside first.

1119
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:02,940
Okay, Honey?

1120
01:01:04,040 --> 01:01:07,920
[Back to the waterproofing vs.
securing the structure.]

1121
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:09,540
Have you never built anything before?

1122
01:01:09,540 --> 01:01:13,620
We have to make sure
that it's balanced first.

1123
01:01:13,620 --> 01:01:15,530
- Come on, Mister!
- It won't be balanced otherwise.

1124
01:01:15,830 --> 01:01:18,280
[Not a fit, not a fit...]

1125
01:01:18,290 --> 01:01:21,490
- This isn't going to work.
- You and I are not a good fit.

1126
01:01:21,790 --> 01:01:25,340
- We can worry about the interior later.
- Hang on, we have to hurry.

1127
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:28,630
Stop worrying about the
inside so much.

1128
01:01:28,630 --> 01:01:30,940
We can do that once we're in there.

1129
01:01:30,940 --> 01:01:33,340
- Seriously, Mister!
- Just stop with the taping.

1130
01:01:35,140 --> 01:01:38,040
[Jae Suk is continuing with his
waterproofing efforts.]

1131
01:01:38,040 --> 01:01:41,480
- We have to do this part too.
- We have to make sure it's balanced first.

1132
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:43,060
Why are you so obsessed with that?

1133
01:01:43,740 --> 01:01:45,200
[Time to start wrapping.]

1134
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:47,030
There you go.

1135
01:01:49,190 --> 01:01:51,630
- Ouch, that hurts.
- You come over this way.

1136
01:01:52,260 --> 01:01:53,480
You go that way.

1137
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:56,230
- Here, grab it.
- Are you talking to me in casual speech?

1138
01:01:57,670 --> 01:01:59,880
[Bickering about every little thing.]

1139
01:02:02,570 --> 01:02:05,660
[Jong Kook and Ye Rim complete
building their rowboat.]

1140
01:02:05,660 --> 01:02:08,690
[Kwang Gyu coming over to take a look
at their boat.]

1141
01:02:08,690 --> 01:02:10,640
Yours looks very similar to ours.

1142
01:02:10,650 --> 01:02:13,740
Ours is a boxy looking shape,
and yours isn't that much different.

1143
01:02:13,740 --> 01:02:16,190
It has to look like a boat.

1144
01:02:16,190 --> 01:02:19,650
- How did you do the bottom?
- Stop looking, Kyung Gyu.

1145
01:02:19,650 --> 01:02:21,370
Stop looking at our boat.

1146
01:02:24,180 --> 01:02:27,080
What are you doing?
Why are you trying to ruin our boat?

1147
01:02:27,080 --> 01:02:29,080
[Try to ruin other people's boats since
he's not happy with his own.]

1148
01:02:29,140 --> 01:02:30,600
- What's going on here?
- What?

1149
01:02:31,670 --> 01:02:33,860
- They made it very sturdy.
- Isn't it great?

1150
01:02:36,150 --> 01:02:39,340

- that thing?
- That's going to just float.

01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:49,060
No, it's going to flip over.

1155
01:02:50,340 --> 01:02:53,150
We have to consider this our
lifeboat as we build it.

survive in the amazon.

What's wrong?

1173
01:03:43,370 --> 01:03:46,010
You just stay down there.
I'll finish up the boat.

- Yes, I think it's done.

[Will Jung Chi and Jung In's boat
float on water?]

1185

than how it looks.

1186

But you guys did a good job of
making it look like a boat, didn't they?

01:12:32,810 --> 01:12:35,340
Wow... Ha Ha's pretty fast.

1314
01:12:35,340 --> 01:12:36,810
They're going to beat them.

1315
01:12:37,480 --> 01:12:40,090
[Which team will get the better record?]

1316
01:12:43,060 --> 01:12:46,150
[Ha Ha crosses the finish line
with this experienced rowing skills.]

1317
01:12:47,150 --> 01:12:50,930
[By the split of a hair,
Jong Kook and Ye Rim also crosses the line!]

1318
01:12:50,930 --> 01:12:53,390
- Aren't we awesome?
- We're awesome!

1319
01:12:53,390 --> 01:12:54,610
- Yes!
- Yes!

1320
01:12:55,750 --> 01:12:59,530
[Kkuk on the other hand is disappointed
with their record.]

1321
01:12:59,530 --> 01:13:02,460
It's not the boat that went,
but Jong Kook who made the boat go.

1322
01:13:04,280 --> 01:13:07,170
[Highly anticipated contestants number five-
Jae Suk and Kwang Gyu.]

1323
01:13:07,180 --> 01:13:09,370
Which apartment are you guys
moving into?

1324
01:13:09,370 --> 01:13:14,970
[Refrigerator box/Coffin boat-
Contestants number 5- Jae Suk and Kwang Gyu.]

1325
01:13:14,970 --> 01:13:17,610
I guarantee 100% that
their boat is going to capsize.

1326
01:13:17,620 --> 01:13:19,410
It really looks awful.

1327
01:13:19,410 --> 01:13:21,400
I bet they won't make it past 10m.

1328
01:13:21,400 --> 01:13:23,310
Are you ready?

1329
01:13:23,630 --> 01:13:25,930
You look really scared, Kwang Gyu.

1330
01:13:25,930 --> 01:13:28,110
I feel like you guys are going to
capsize the moment you get going.

1331
01:13:28,110 --> 01:13:29,810
[Looks like their boat is going to capsize
the moment the helpers let go.]

1332
01:13:31,100 --> 01:13:33,660
- Okay, we're good.
- They're not going to make it.

1333
01:13:45,170 --> 01:13:47,910
- Why kind of an oar did you give us?
- Our oar just broke!

1334
01:13:49,180 --> 01:13:51,270
[It's a sight to behold.]

1335
01:13:51,280 --> 01:13:53,580
The way I see it, I guarantee
that we won't be in last place.

1336
01:13:55,490 --> 01:13:57,430
They can't even get balanced.

1337
01:13:57,970 --> 01:14:00,100
[Making another attempt at it after
having switched out their oars.]

1338
01:14:01,590 --> 01:14:03,000
They're going to sink.

1339
01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:10,340
- Everyone, keep your eyes on their boat!
- This really is going to be our coffin.

1340
01:14:11,930 --> 01:14:13,830
They're never going to make it.

1341
01:14:13,830 --> 01:14:15,620
Let's see how well they do.

1342
01:14:17,010 --> 01:14:19,640
[Are they even going to be
able to get on their way?]

1343
01:14:22,050 --> 01:14:23,800
- You're leaning to the left.
- Start!

1344
01:14:23,800 --> 01:14:25,410
[Start!]

1345
01:14:25,410 --> 01:14:28,710
One, two!
One, two!

1346
01:14:30,930 --> 01:14:32,240
What the heck?

1347
01:14:34,940 --> 01:14:37,280
[It's quite fast!]

1348
01:14:41,280 --> 01:14:43,950
One, two!
One, two!

1349
01:14:44,630 --> 01:14:47,310
[Totally unexpected.]

1350
01:14:48,300 --> 01:14:50,480
How can this be?

1351
01:14:54,480 --> 01:14:57,090
[Rowing as if their lives depended on it.]

1352
01:14:57,090 --> 01:14:59,460
[Even funnier because they're moving fast
when they've already been discounted.]

1353
01:14:59,460 --> 01:15:02,540
[If we stop... we'll sink!]

1354
01:15:05,480 --> 01:15:07,230
What is this?

1355
01:15:08,600 --> 01:15:12,520
[Determined not to fall in,
they speed along to the finish line!]

1356
01:15:13,780 --> 01:15:17,860
[Jae Suk and Kwang Gyu
crosses the finish line!]

1357
01:15:19,470 --> 01:15:21,150
[What are they doing at the finish line?]

1358
01:15:21,150 --> 01:15:24,280
[The refrigerator box capsizes
the moment it completes its duty.]

1359
01:15:27,480 --> 01:15:29,900
[But they still did it!]

1360
01:15:30,140 --> 01:15:32,260
- Good job!
- Good job!

1361
01:15:32,270 --> 01:15:35,850
It's a boat that capsizes if you stop,
and will stay upright if you keep going.

1362
01:15:39,070 --> 01:15:40,280
That was good.

1363
01:15:40,280 --> 01:15:42,460
- Why did you kiss me?
- That was good.

1364
01:15:44,440 --> 01:15:46,420
- Even though everyone mocked us...
- I know!

1365
01:15:46,420 --> 01:15:49,250
- But we did it!
- They called it our coffin!

1366
01:15:49,250 --> 01:15:51,160
What are you doing, Father!

1367
01:15:52,650 --> 01:15:56,160
[What was their record?
You'll soon find out!]

1368
01:15:57,190 --> 01:16:01,620
[Monday Couple still practicing
their rowing skills.]

1369
01:16:01,620 --> 01:16:04,790
One, two!
Pull it through to the end! There you go.

1370
01:16:05,840 --> 01:16:06,860
We got it!

1371
01:16:06,860 --> 01:16:10,780
[This is why they say that you should never
learn how to drive from your boyfriend.]

1372
01:16:11,190 --> 01:16:19,400
[Monday Raft-
Contestants number 6- Gary and Ji Hyo.]

1373
01:16:19,400 --> 01:16:21,220
Nice long strokes, okay?

1374
01:16:21,220 --> 01:16:24,570
- Nice long strokes, okay? Fighting!
- I said, okay!

1375
01:16:24,570 --> 01:16:26,450
Stop nagging!

1376
01:16:26,460 --> 01:16:33,810
[Kwang-Park Boat:
Contestants number 7- Kwang Soo, John Park.]

1377
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:35,840
Set, go!

1378
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:37,450
[Go!]

1379
01:16:38,420 --> 01:16:42,480
[Both teams start off at a good speed!]

1380
01:16:42,480 --> 01:16:44,640
One, two!
One, two!

1381
01:16:45,960 --> 01:16:47,710
No!
Slow down, Kwang Soo!

1382
01:16:49,210 --> 01:16:53,330
[Monday Couple in perfect sync
from all their practicing.]

1383
01:16:53,960 --> 01:16:55,620
They're fast.

1384
01:16:57,400 --> 01:16:59,010
Look at me and follow my lead.

1385
01:17:00,570 --> 01:17:05,300
[But... where are Kwang Soo
and John Park?]

1386
01:17:07,520 --> 01:17:10,380
[Gary and Ji Hyo moving right along.]

1387
01:17:10,380 --> 01:17:12,470
Gary's rowing is slower than Ji Hyo's.

1388
01:17:15,910 --> 01:17:17,950
Strong pull!
More! More!

1389
01:17:20,060 --> 01:17:22,750
[Gary and Ji Hyo cross
the finish line at top speed!]

1390
01:17:22,760 --> 01:17:24,560
You're such a nagger!

1391
01:17:26,150 --> 01:17:29,200
One, two!
One, two!

1392
01:17:29,200 --> 01:17:32,330
[This is what they've been doing...]

1393
01:17:37,670 --> 01:17:40,380
[They keep turning towards the sides
because of their inability to get in sync.]

1394
01:17:40,380 --> 01:17:43,200
[Kwang Soo's the only one rowing
at top speed.]

1395
01:17:44,040 --> 01:17:45,440
Stop rowing.
Just stop.

1396
01:17:46,390 --> 01:17:48,440
[Now they're going backwards?]

1397
01:17:49,040 --> 01:17:51,400
[Nice skills.]

1398
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:54,920
You guys are going backwards!

1399
01:17:56,660 --> 01:18:00,390
[They finally start going
in the right direction.]

1400
01:18:00,400 --> 01:18:03,510
[Going at top speed-
And going at a leisurely speed.]

1401
01:18:03,510 --> 01:18:04,980
This is so annoying!

1402
01:18:05,710 --> 01:18:07,340
I'm so annoyed!

1403
01:18:12,060 --> 01:18:14,700
What are you doing?
And what did you just say to me?

1404
01:18:16,930 --> 01:18:19,690
[Getting back on their way after
getting back in sync with one another.]

1405
01:18:19,960 --> 01:18:23,780
[How can they be so much like
their namesake?]

1406
01:18:24,500 --> 01:18:28,150
[Kwang Soo's rowing direction is...]

1407
01:18:28,150 --> 01:18:31,130
- Why aren't you rowing?
- You're rowing way too fast.

1408
01:18:31,130 --> 01:18:32,860
- Don't give up!
- You're rowing too fast.

1409
01:18:32,870 --> 01:18:35,750
One, two!
One, two!

1410
01:18:35,750 --> 01:18:38,090
They should just go backwards.

1411
01:18:38,090 --> 01:18:39,600
You guys are going backwards again.

1412
01:18:39,610 --> 01:18:42,450
One, two!
One, two!

1413
01:18:42,450 --> 01:18:45,230
[The boat finally starting to move forward
with Kwang Soo losing his stamina.]

1414
01:18:45,710 --> 01:18:49,420
[Really took a lot of effort to get here.]

1415
01:18:51,730 --> 01:18:54,730
[Kwang Soo and John Park
finally crosses the finish line.]

1416
01:18:55,570 --> 01:18:58,790
[Even though it wasn't a slow boat,
their rowing was... what was their record?]

1417
01:19:01,460 --> 01:19:04,980
[Time to reveal the record
for all seven couples!]

1418
01:19:04,980 --> 01:19:06,060
I hope we made it in the top three!

1419
01:19:06,060 --> 01:19:07,440
I really want to win a gold bar!

1420
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,960
Kim Jong Kook and Ye Rim's
record was 2 minutes and 5 seconds.

1421
01:19:10,960 --> 01:19:12,800
- What did you say?
- Did they come in at seventh place?

1422
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:14,390
What about this team?

1423
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:18,950
Lee Kwang Soo and John Park's
record was 1 minutes and 58 seconds.

1424
01:19:18,950 --> 01:19:20,870
[Lee Kwang Soo and John Park-
1 minute and 58 seconds!]

1425
01:19:20,870 --> 01:19:23,380
- Kwang!
- We didn't come in at last place!

1426
01:19:23,380 --> 01:19:25,040
- Kwang!
- Cross!

1427
01:19:25,040 --> 01:19:26,750
You have to say 'Park' first,
you dummy!

1428
01:19:28,740 --> 01:19:30,600
In fifth place is...

1429
01:19:31,760 --> 01:19:35,320
Ha Ha and Sa Yuri with
one minute and 36 seconds.

1430
01:19:36,880 --> 01:19:40,130
In fourth place is,
Ji Suk Jin and Park Sang Myun.

1431
01:19:40,140 --> 01:19:42,730
They came in at one minute 35 seconds.

1432
01:19:42,730 --> 01:19:45,240
- This is nerve wrecking!
- Im so nervous!

1433
01:19:45,240 --> 01:19:47,410
Now there are only three teams left.

1434
01:19:47,810 --> 01:19:51,530
[Who placed first of these three teams?]

1435
01:19:51,530 --> 01:19:53,060
Jung Chi and Jung In's team...

1436
01:19:53,060 --> 01:19:54,690
Their record is...

1437
01:19:55,110 --> 01:19:56,930
50.65 seconds.

1438
01:19:56,930 --> 01:20:00,030
[Jung Chi and Jung In with
a record of 50.56 seconds.]

1439
01:20:00,030 --> 01:20:02,070
Team Gary and Ji Hyo...

1440
01:20:02,790 --> 01:20:04,450
with a record of 50...

1441
01:20:08,500 --> 01:20:10,040
50...

1442
01:20:11,910 --> 01:20:13,560
50.76 seconds.

1443
01:20:13,560 --> 01:20:18,460
[Gary and Ji Hyo with a record of
50.76 seconds.]

1444
01:20:18,470 --> 01:20:21,020
Team Yoo Jae Suk and Kim Kwang Gyu.

1445
01:20:30,460 --> 01:20:32,520
42.25 seconds.

1446
01:20:32,520 --> 01:20:34,450
[Jae Suk and Kwang Gyu break
the record with 42.25 seconds!]

1447
01:20:34,450 --> 01:20:39,050
[Jae Suk and Kwang Gyu win with
42.25 seconds!]

1448
01:20:39,970 --> 01:20:44,070
[The winners of the first ever
cardboard boat race- Jae Suk and Kwang Gyu!]

1449
01:20:44,760 --> 01:20:47,150
[Second place- Jung Chi and Jung In.
Third place- Gary and Ji Hyo.]

1450
01:20:47,150 --> 01:20:50,970
Any other time, I'd clap for
the first place winners

1451
01:20:50,980 --> 01:20:54,310
but it's just absurd that they came in
at first place with a boat like that.

1452
01:20:56,060 --> 01:20:58,810
They won first place
in their refrigerator box!

1453
01:21:00,460 --> 01:21:03,890
[The will to survive is definitely
more crucial than the tool itself.]

1454
01:21:13,470 --> 01:21:16,710
[All the couples having arrived
at the final camping location.]

1455
01:21:17,110 --> 01:21:22,610
[They still haven't found
Ye Rim's missing gold bar.]

1456
01:21:22,610 --> 01:21:24,010
Who took our gold!

1457
01:21:24,790 --> 01:21:26,850
- Since I'm the judge...
- What is it was Kwang Gyu?

1458
01:21:28,510 --> 01:21:30,070
Whomever took our gold is a thief!

1459
01:21:30,080 --> 01:21:31,680
There's no respect in that situation!

1460
01:21:32,810 --> 01:21:35,450
- Am I right or am I right?
- You are being so rash!

1461
01:21:35,450 --> 01:21:38,700
- It's not me.
- We don't know who took it right now.

1462
01:21:42,500 --> 01:21:45,550
[Why does Jung In have four gold bars?]

1463
01:21:45,550 --> 01:21:47,990
Hang on a second.
Why do you have four gold bars?

1464
01:21:49,030 --> 01:21:50,970
Why do you have four gold bars?
Hang on a second here.

1465
01:21:50,970 --> 01:21:54,040
[Jung Chi and Jung In should only
have three gold bars?]

1466
01:21:54,040 --> 01:21:56,270
I was told to steal other people's gold
when we started the race earlier.

1467
01:21:56,930 --> 01:21:59,060
[Don't you remember?]

1468
01:21:59,490 --> 01:22:03,180
<i>You all have to take care of your own
gold bars throughout the day.</i>

1469
01:22:03,180 --> 01:22:07,590
<i>If you lose it, or have it stolen from you,
we can't be responsible for that.</i>

1470
01:22:07,600 --> 01:22:11,680
[Then it means... that we can steal it?]

1471
01:22:12,420 --> 01:22:15,630
[So she actually stole it!]

1472
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:19,880
- She's a bad person!
- I can't believe you did that!

1473
01:22:19,880 --> 01:22:23,140
- She's a thief.
- I didn't take you to be like that.

1474
01:22:23,580 --> 01:22:25,100
The thing that scared me the most...

1475
01:22:25,100 --> 01:22:28,660
was when she threw away Ye Rim's
bag in the bathroom garbage can.

1476
01:22:29,340 --> 01:22:32,080
[Admitting to the truth?]

1477
01:22:32,080 --> 01:22:34,400
I was too scared to even say anything.

1478
01:22:34,400 --> 01:22:37,060
You stole our gold,
and threw away the bag in the trash?

1479
01:22:37,060 --> 01:22:38,900
You just took the gold out of there?

1480
01:22:38,900 --> 01:22:41,250
- She's one scary person.
- I didn't do anything illegal.

1481
01:22:41,250 --> 01:22:44,560
- What I did wasn't illegal.
- He did tell us that in the beginning.

1482
01:22:44,560 --> 01:22:46,760
[Can't say anything since it was stated
in the rules at the beginning of the race.]

1483
01:22:47,310 --> 01:22:50,550
- She's my teammate, but she scared me
- So I can just take it back then?

1484
01:22:50,810 --> 01:22:53,740
[Mr. Capable starting to get angry!]

1485
01:22:53,740 --> 01:22:54,840
Then I can just take it back?

1486
01:22:54,840 --> 01:22:56,590
- I can just take it from others?
- Counsel!

1487
01:22:59,780 --> 01:23:04,740
[It's too late to take it now... Only the gold
they already have will be counted.]

1488
01:23:04,740 --> 01:23:07,920
In that case,
these two teams are tied in first place.

1489
01:23:07,920 --> 01:23:12,010
[Jung Chi, Jung In and Gary, Ji Hyo
both win for having four gold bars!]

1490
01:23:12,010 --> 01:23:13,940
[A special mission for these two teams?]

1491
01:23:13,940 --> 01:23:15,970
What is it that you want us to do
with these scheme artists?

1492
01:23:16,060 --> 01:23:19,270
The teams who did not come in at first place
must give back their gold bars.

1493
01:23:19,270 --> 01:23:22,730
[All the other teams who didn't come in at
first place must give back their gold bars.]

1494
01:23:23,070 --> 01:23:24,790
[Say... what?]

1495
01:23:24,790 --> 01:23:28,780
- What kind of a filthy rule is that!
- What are you doing!

1496
01:23:29,950 --> 01:23:33,370
[You had to win to keep the gold...]

1497
01:23:35,730 --> 01:23:39,040
Listen to how my hoarse my voice sounds
from trying to protect it all day.

1498
01:23:41,770 --> 01:23:43,690
The race is now all over.

1499
01:23:43,700 --> 01:23:46,130
The couples with the most number of
gold bars at the moment are

1500
01:23:46,130 --> 01:23:50,350
the Monday Couple,
and Couple Jung Chi and Jung In.

1501
01:23:50,600 --> 01:23:54,880
Each team must now decide
whether they want to take the gold...

1502
01:23:54,880 --> 01:23:57,970
or stay with their partner.
You must choose between the two.

1503
01:23:57,970 --> 01:24:00,560
[Both teams must now decide whether
they want to keep the gold or their partner.]

1504
01:24:00,560 --> 01:24:04,990
[The ultimate decision.
Will it be the gold, or your partner?]

1505
01:24:05,950 --> 01:24:10,220
<i>You will each be given a minute to think
about your decision in your own tent.</i>

1506
01:24:10,720 --> 01:24:13,190
<i>In the case where both members of
a team chooses their partner</i>

1507
01:24:13,190 --> 01:24:16,400
<i>they may not be able to keep all the gold
that they've won thus far</i>

1508
01:24:16,400 --> 01:24:19,760
<i>but they will be able to verify and maintain
their true love that they have for each other.</i>

1509
01:24:20,120 --> 01:24:23,850
<i>And in the case where one chooses the gold,
and the other chooses their partner...</i>

1510
01:24:24,180 --> 01:24:29,430
<i>the person who chose the gold on that team
will take all the gold for themselves.</i>

1511
01:24:29,810 --> 01:24:33,490
<i>In the case where both members choose
their greed for the gold...</i>

1512
01:24:34,170 --> 01:24:37,380
<i>they will have to turn in all the gold
that they've won thus far.</i>

1513
01:24:37,380 --> 01:24:39,080
[If they both choose the gold,
all the gold must be given back.]

1514
01:24:40,120 --> 01:24:45,980
[Will it be the gold, or their partner?]

1515
01:24:52,120 --> 01:24:54,990
[These two couples...
what is their heart's desire?]

1516
01:24:54,990 --> 01:24:56,810
Their misfortune is our happiness.

1517
01:24:56,810 --> 01:24:58,740
[Non-winners unhappy about having
become the bridesmaids.]

1518
01:24:58,740 --> 01:25:00,750
How about we get the gold
if they don't win it?

1519
01:25:00,750 --> 01:25:05,950
[Jong Kook suggests that they get the gold
if the winning couples loses theirs?]

1520
01:25:05,950 --> 01:25:08,510
- Don't you think so?
- We can all split it.

1521
01:25:08,510 --> 01:25:10,410
<i>If that happens,
like Kim Jong Kook suggested...</i>

1522
01:25:11,200 --> 01:25:15,570
<i>In the case where they both choose gold,
and they have to turn their gold back in...</i>

1523
01:25:15,570 --> 01:25:17,850
<i>then I will divide up the gold
amongst all of you.</i>

1524
01:25:17,850 --> 01:25:20,120
[Even if one couple loses their gold,
it means gold for the loser teams!]

1525
01:25:20,120 --> 01:25:23,200
- We need this once in a while.
- Gold! Gold!

1526
01:25:24,480 --> 01:25:27,380
<i>We will first go with the Monday Couple.</i>

1527
01:25:27,380 --> 01:25:31,430
[Time to check where the Monday Couple's
hearts stands.]

1528
01:25:31,440 --> 01:25:35,320
[That woman, and that man...
Will be it the gold, or each other?]

1529
01:25:35,320 --> 01:25:37,280
I assure you that they both
chose the gold.

1530
01:25:39,730 --> 01:25:44,740
Gold!

1531
01:25:45,330 --> 01:25:50,320
[Just... what did their hearts choose?]

1532
01:25:50,750 --> 01:25:53,690
I want you, Kang Gary!

1533
01:25:53,690 --> 01:25:56,860
[Three years of going back and forth
in their love affair...]

1534
01:25:56,860 --> 01:26:01,970
[The man and the woman having relied on
each other like a lover and a friend.]

1535
01:26:01,970 --> 01:26:05,760
[Just what is inside their hearts right now?]

1536
01:26:07,690 --> 01:26:09,210
He's going to choose gold.

1537
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:12,600
[Gary chooses Ji Hyo!]

1538
01:26:13,380 --> 01:26:15,570
- What the heck?
- You should've chosen gold.

1539
01:26:15,570 --> 01:26:18,220
It's been awhile since we've been
coupled up like this.

1540
01:26:18,220 --> 01:26:19,920
You should've been honest
with yourself.

1541
01:26:19,920 --> 01:26:24,660
I know that she wrote down gold,
and we can just split the stash later.

1542
01:26:24,660 --> 01:26:26,770
[Having prepared himself for a situation
where Ji Hyo would've chosen the gold?]

1543
01:26:26,770 --> 01:26:29,470
- That's true.
- You guys don't know what it's like.

1544
01:26:29,470 --> 01:26:32,630
You have no idea how hard we worked
together today building that boat.

1545
01:26:32,630 --> 01:26:36,390
It felt like we went back to the way
we used to be two years ago.

1546
01:26:37,060 --> 01:26:39,190
You guys don't know what
that feels like.

1547
01:26:39,370 --> 01:26:43,580
- Kiss her! Kiss her!
- What do you mean, kiss?

1548
01:26:43,580 --> 01:26:47,610
You were asking me about
French kissing in the car earlier too.

1549
01:26:48,060 --> 01:26:49,220
Ji Hyo's answer?

1550
01:26:49,450 --> 01:26:52,750
[Gary chose his partner...
What did Ji Hyo's heart tell her?]

1551
01:26:52,750 --> 01:26:54,370
I...

1552
01:26:56,190 --> 01:26:57,920
Are they saying that they're going to
start dating for real now?

1553
01:26:58,180 --> 01:27:00,520
- I can't even stand this.
- Gold?

1554
01:27:04,100 --> 01:27:05,130
No, it's her partner.

1555
01:27:05,550 --> 01:27:07,410
Kang Gary?

1556
01:27:07,410 --> 01:27:09,670
- What is this?
- What are you guys doing?

1557
01:27:11,430 --> 01:27:13,580
You're just playing with me,
aren't you?

1558
01:27:13,580 --> 01:27:15,810
Show us what your answer is!
What are you doing?

1559
01:27:15,930 --> 01:27:20,030
[In her heart is...]

1560
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:26,520
[But still...
Monday Couple is the best!]

1561
01:27:26,520 --> 01:27:28,350
[My partner, Kang Gary.]

1562
01:27:28,350 --> 01:27:31,240
[Ji Hyo also chooses her partner!]

1563
01:27:31,240 --> 01:27:35,140
[Monday Couple treasures each other
more than the gold!]

1564
01:27:41,760 --> 01:27:43,360
Why did you do that?

1565
01:27:43,360 --> 01:27:46,170
- You should've chosen the gold!
- I thought you were going to choose the gold!

1566
01:27:46,180 --> 01:27:48,270
We should've split it!
What were you thinking!

1567
01:27:48,270 --> 01:27:50,410
I thought you were going to
pick the gold!

1568
01:27:50,410 --> 01:27:53,000
- You two are beautiful together.
- Let's do it over.

1569
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:55,610
[At least one of you had to have chosen
the gold to have won anything...]

1570
01:27:57,130 --> 01:28:01,120
[The loser teams are too happy at the
winning couple losing their gold.]

1571
01:28:01,120 --> 01:28:05,550
Gold!

1572
01:28:05,550 --> 01:28:08,510
But it still makes me happy to know
where your heart stands.

1573
01:28:11,370 --> 01:28:14,280
Gary, you won something much more
precious than gold.

1574
01:28:14,280 --> 01:28:16,730
[Time to find out what Jung Chi
and Jung In chose.]

1575
01:28:17,220 --> 01:28:20,080
I'm positive that they chose gold.
Guarantee that they chose gold.

1576
01:28:20,080 --> 01:28:22,280
I bet it'll start off with
one of them choosing the gold.

1577
01:28:23,410 --> 01:28:24,680
We have to start off with the gold.

1578
01:28:25,620 --> 01:28:27,030
I'll start.

1579
01:28:27,030 --> 01:28:31,120
[Real life couple, Jung Chi and Jung In.
Will it be the gold or their love?]

1580
01:28:32,330 --> 01:28:39,070
[Their love for each other that's
been growing all these years...]

1581
01:28:39,070 --> 01:28:43,910
[Even through all of their bickering,
their hearts are full of their love.]

1582
01:28:45,820 --> 01:28:48,530
[That man's selection is...]

1583
01:28:48,530 --> 01:28:50,620
[Gold]

1584
01:28:50,620 --> 01:28:53,440
[Jung Chi chooses gold!]

1585
01:28:53,440 --> 01:28:57,880
Jo Jung Chi!
Jo Jung Chi!

1586
01:28:59,610 --> 01:29:02,750
The thought of gold made me so happy
so I even drew a picture of it.

1587
01:29:03,130 --> 01:29:06,710
Gold!

1588
01:29:07,410 --> 01:29:10,460
[If Jung In also chose the gold,
it'll be time to celebrate!]

1589
01:29:10,940 --> 01:29:12,590
Get ready to celebrate!

1590
01:29:12,590 --> 01:29:14,260
[Then her selection is...]

1591
01:29:14,260 --> 01:29:18,400
[Will it be gold, or love?]

1592
01:29:32,100 --> 01:29:33,480
[Partner]

1593
01:29:33,480 --> 01:29:35,500
[Jung In chooses her partner!]

1594
01:29:40,930 --> 01:29:42,270
In that case...

1595
01:29:42,810 --> 01:29:45,510
Jung Chi and Jung In can keep
all the gold that they've earned today.

1596
01:29:45,510 --> 01:29:48,040
[Jung Chi and Jung In get to
keep all four of their gold bars!]

1597
01:29:48,040 --> 01:29:50,710
There was one more rule that
has been set from the beginning.

1598
01:29:50,710 --> 01:29:52,940
[Rule that's been set from the beginning?]

1599
01:29:53,740 --> 01:29:56,720
<i>The best selection that could've been
made in this couple race today...</i>

1600
01:29:56,720 --> 01:29:59,230
<i>was for both partners to
choose each other.</i>

1601
01:29:59,230 --> 01:30:01,940
- That was our rule from the beginning.
- Is there a golden turtle or something?

1602
01:30:01,940 --> 01:30:07,770
<i>You will each receive twice the amount of
gold that you've earned today.</i>

1603
01:30:07,770 --> 01:30:11,710
[Monday Couple will each receive twice the
amount of gold that they've earned today.]

1604
01:30:11,710 --> 01:30:16,170
[The ultimate winners are-
Monday Couple for having chosen each other.]

1605
01:30:16,170 --> 01:30:19,080
[Today was a love race, after all.]

1606
01:30:19,080 --> 01:30:21,770
<i>So Gary gets two bars since he had
possession of one bar.</i>

1607
01:30:23,100 --> 01:30:26,870
<i>And since Ji Hyo had three in her possession,
she wins a total of six bars.</i>

1608
01:30:26,870 --> 01:30:28,230
You knew it all along, didn't you?
You greedy person!

1609
01:30:28,230 --> 01:30:30,200
[Starting their bickering all over again.]

1610
01:30:30,200 --> 01:30:31,290
Half of that is mine!

1611
01:30:31,290 --> 01:30:33,710
Ji Hyo always gets so lucky with her gold.

1612
01:30:33,710 --> 01:30:36,070
This is putting Jung Chi and Jung In
in a very weird position.

1613
01:30:36,070 --> 01:30:37,510
[Putting Jung Chi and Jung In
in an awkward position.]

1614
01:30:37,520 --> 01:30:40,220
Congratulations for being the only one
to have chosen gold over your partner.

1615
01:30:43,540 --> 01:30:45,510
- That's our Monday Couple.
- Monday Couple.

1616
01:30:46,290 --> 01:30:49,580
Kiss her!

1617
01:30:49,590 --> 01:30:51,730
- Stop telling them to kiss!
- If that's what you want, I'll do it.

1618
01:30:54,860 --> 01:30:58,900
[Having a partner...
is more precious than real gold.]
