Is this where I get off?

00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:38,170

<i>Welcome, Running Man members.</i>

43
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,500

<i>Today's race is... The Icy Order Race.</i>

<i>The Icy Order Race.</i>

00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:28,140
Icy order...

50
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:31,260
The order does need to be redefined.

00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:33,160
<i>During the course of today...</i>

52
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:39,840

their uniforms immediately.</i>

54
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:50,140
[Pre-assigned uniforms.]

55
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:51,440
I'm in second place.

56
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:54,460
Why am I in second place?

57
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:57,650
What? Sixth place?
That's just ridiculous.

58
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:01,830
I get it, is it according to looks?
That's just ridiculous.

59
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:03,720
I'm going to work my way up.

60
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:06,080
Mark my words,
I'm going to work my way up!

61
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:08,440
[Already behaving like a resident
of the corner space in the ice building.]

62
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:11,790
I want some steak too!

63
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,660
<i>Change into your clothes.</i>

64
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:22,030
Okay.

65
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:25,190
[Thus, without even knowing the reason...]

66
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:28,790
[Running Man members are relegated
to their position in The Order.]

67
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,670
Is that my breakfast?

68
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,610
How is this steak?

69
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:42,910
[Frozen meal that anyone can enjoy
in the middle of the hot summer.]

70
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,100
I guess I should just be grateful
that I'm even getting this at all.

71
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:52,140
[A meal that's given to the person
in first place only.]

72
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:55,110
So no one else is getting this?

73
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,240
Everyone has different food depending on
which order they're in, don't they?

74
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:00,340
[Giraffe with his bean jelly.]

75
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:01,910
I'm so sick and tired of this.

76
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:05,990
Just how long do I have to keep
putting up with this kind of treatment!

77
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:09,130
I want some protein too!

78
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:12,940
Give me my steak!

79
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:16,800
<i>Running Man members, you are now all aware
of your own standings in The Order?</i>

80
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,240
I can't even hear what he's saying
down here in the basement.

81
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,590
<i>This isn't a guarantee of your
position in The Order.</i>

82
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:26,080
<i>But you will have several different chances
to change your position in The Order.</i>

83
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:29,930
<i>Your first mission which will give you
a chance at changing the order...</i>

84
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:32,950
<i>is the Snow Elevator.</i>

85
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:37,490
- The Snow Elevator.
- Snow elevator?

86
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:42,500
<i>You are all placed in different spots
depending on your position in The Order.</i>

87
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,530
<i>First place is on the very top floor</i>

88
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:48,570
<i>and seventh place is on the
very lowest level.</i>

89
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:50,440
<i>In order to change your position
in The Order</i>

90
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:54,380
<i>you must first board the elevator that will
take you up to higher floors in the building.</i>

91
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,310
<i>You must get off on the floor that is
higher than the floor that you're currently on</i>

92
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:01,960
<i>and by playing and winning a game,
you can take over that place in the order.</i>

93
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:05,930
<i>But, you only have one chance
to change your position per game</i>

94
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:08,590
<i>and the person who lands in the last place
per round will be eliminated</i>

95
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:12,400
<i>and will be given a treatment
very befitting of the position.</i>

96
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:16,420
<i>We wish everyone luck in maintaining your
upper position to avoid this treatment.</i>

97
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:19,270
<i>We will now start our first round.</i>

98
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,200
<i>For your first round...</i>

99
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:23,780
<i>it will be sixth position vs. seventh position.</i>

100
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:26,140
<i>Fifth place vs. fourth position.</i>

101
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:30,590
<i>And third place will compete
against second place.</i>

102
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,000
<i>If the person in the seventh place
loses this round</i>

103
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,530
<i>that person will firmly establish
their position in the seventh place</i>

104
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:37,880
<i>and will no longer be given any more chances
to escape from their position in rank.</i>

105
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:40,320
I won't have any more chances
to move up in my position?

106
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:44,490
This is the first and last chance
that I will ever have in my life.

107
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:48,140
My last chance to get away from this rubble
of trash that I'm so sick and tired of!

108
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:51,140
This is my first and final opportunity.

109
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:57,230
[None of the members are aware of
who is on which floor.]

110
00:06:57,230 --> 00:07:00,260
- Okay.
- Please board the elevator.

111
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,690
<i>Please board the elevator.</i>

112
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:13,300
[Basement Giraffe dreaming of moving up
in his position up to sixth place.]

113
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:24,540
Just how far are you planning on going
with all your transformations?

114
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,460
I've finally moved up one floor.

115
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,740
Hello.

116
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:36,650
- Hey, are you in last place?
- You're in sixth place?

117
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:39,620
- Why are you in sixth place?
- I don't know why I'm in sixth place either.

118
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:42,150
I thought the order was based on age,
but I guess that's not the case.

119
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:44,680
- I think the order is based on looks.
- Hey!

120
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:48,910
- Then why would I be in seventh place?
- You're in seventh place in looks.

121
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:52,880
- Gary! I'd be in fourth place, at least!
- You're just being absurd right now.

122
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:55,240
- Hurry up and get back down.
- Gary.

123
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:59,020
I bet you that you'll stay in
seventh place for the entire day.

124
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,250
It's no joke down there.

125
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:02,910
- You can't even betray anyone..
- No!

126
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:04,590
You can't even betray your way
out of this one!

127
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:07,080
You have to win this race based
purely on your skills.

128
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,440
Why don't we work together?

129
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:11,670
What do you mean, work together?
This is an individual battle.

130
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:13,390
This isn't a name tag elimination.

131
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:16,780
[Blank Ji on her way to compete with
the person in fourth place.]

132
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,900
What the heck?

133
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,400
- Ji Hyo, it's you?
- Ha Ha, you're in fourth place?

134
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:25,420
- Wow, I didn't know it was going to be you.
- What the heck is this?

135
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:27,270
This is too strong of an opponent
right from the beginning.

136
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:30,130
Anyone but Jong Kook.

137
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:32,310
I'd be happy with Ji Hyo.

138
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:33,550
Someone's here!

139
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:34,880
The door is about to open!

140
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:43,600
[Oh no... the Tiger is here.]

141
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:47,370
Keep going up.

142
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,630
Just keep going up.

143
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:51,590
- I said, just go on up.
- Can you pass?

144
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:53,360
- Why is he here?
- Are you in third place?

145
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,430
<i>Here's your first round.</i>

146
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:00,390
<i>Your first round game is...</i>

147
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:02,920
<i>Your first round game is...</i>

148
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:06,500
I guarantee that I can beat you as long as
it's not the name tag elimination game.

149
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:09,700
<i>A one-on-one name tag
elimination game.</i>

150
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,300
<i>A one-on-one name tag
elimination game.</i>

151
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:16,600
<i>Your first round game is...</i>

152
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,570
<i>one-on-one name tag
elimination game.</i>

153
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:23,830
- One-on-one?
- A one-on-one name tag elimination game.

154
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:27,240
[First place winner can watch the
first round in the comfort of his seat.]

155
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,310
Bravo!

156
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,880
This is too much.

157
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:36,350
Why does it have to be this?
This is just absurd!

158
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:40,620
- This isn't really much of a competition.
- Then just give me your name tag.

159
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:42,600
I should make it entertaining, at least.

160
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:45,550
This is absolutely ridiculous.
It's absurd that this is the first game.

161
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:47,550
- That's what I'm saying.
- I guess it's better to be punished upfront.

162
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:49,840
I think it's better to just
get it over with.

163
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,680
Come on!

164
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:55,800
- Are you trying to use your strength on me?
- What other choice do I have?

165
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,990
- Suk Jin, I have no other choice.
- I can understand that you have to do this.

166
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:01,860
- I have no other choice, Gary.
- Nothing I can do about it either.

167
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:04,850
You're just made to live
on the bottom floor, Kwang Soo.

168
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:07,430
- I'm sick of having to eat the bean jelly!
- Okay, I hear you!

169
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:10,080
I should be doing this with Ha Ha instead.

170
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,560
[Neither are happy about having to
compete with each other.]

171
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,490
Kwang Soo, let's end this quickly!

172
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:15,740
Ji Hyo!

173
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:17,340
This isn't easy.

174
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:21,070
[With the exception of one floor,
the rest of the face-off's aren't as easy.]

175
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:26,640
[Basement Giraffe's attack.]

176
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,370
I vow... I vow to move up!

177
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:31,000
Hey!
What's wrong with you?

178
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,510
[Current seventh place holder
desperate to win his battle.]

179
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:40,780
[Simultaneously?]

180
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,520
[Wow! Seventh place holder,
Kwang Soo wins!]

181
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,890
I vow to move up in my rank!

182
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:54,260
[Fourth place Ha Ha and fifth place Blank Ji
taking a brief break.]

183
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:56,920
[Picking a strand of hair off of
Blank Ji's clothes.]

184
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:01,490
[Figures...]

185
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:05,580
You're such a cheater!

186
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:09,940
Ji Hyo!

187
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:13,510
[Fourth place Ro-Ro eliminates
Blank Ji's name tag.]

188
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:17,670
- I'm sorry, Ji Hyo. Forgive me just once.
- I won't have it!

189
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:20,600
How could you take me out
and cheat like that!

190
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:23,820
Ji Hyo could've won that battle
if her shirt hadn't been turned around.

191
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:26,060
I can tell that Ji Hyo's
really pissed right now.

192
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:30,770
I had no choice, Ji Hyo.

193
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:33,290
- I had no other choice.
- You tricked me!

194
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:37,560
[His cheap shot brings out
the thuggish Ji Hyo.]

195
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:40,090
I had no other choice, Ji Hyo.

196
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:41,640
Please understand where I'm coming from.

197
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:44,780
I wonder if there are any ropes around here?
I can leave you tied up here.

198
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:45,960
[And one obvious battle.]

199
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,620
[Second place holder, Big-nose
is backed up into a corner.]

200
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:52,090
I'm going to protect my second place!

201
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:56,510
[That doesn't seem to be possible...]

202
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,480
Did you tie me up or something?

203
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:02,830
[Not even able to budge a muscle
against Mr. Capable's strength.]

204
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:04,230
Why do you have me tied up?

205
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:07,430
Suk Jin... you have to stop moving.

206
00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:11,440
I'm sorry. It's too hot
to be doing this in the summer.

207
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:15,730
It's really hot to be doing this
in the middle of the summer.

208
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:19,500
Being in third place isn't so bad.
I was actually pretty happy in third place.

209
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:21,630
I didn't even do anything.

210
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,670
You're going to be pretty cold
down there.

211
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,300
Go away. What kind of
a humiliation is this? Seriously.

212
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:31,610
- Why do you find this humiliating?
- Hurry up and just go away!

213
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:38,050
[The positions are starting to move around.]

214
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:43,990
I'll see you later.

215
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:45,560
- I've made up my resolve.
- Gary.

216
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,340
I'll see you later, Gary.

217
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:49,690
I promise to move up in my position.

218
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:51,510
[Giraffe moves up one position
to sixth place.]

219
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:53,550
You're now delegated to being
in the last place.

220
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:56,670
But it's not forever.

221
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,650
[Gary is moved down to the basement.]

222
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:07,700
What the heck is this?
There's not even a place for me to sit?

223
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:11,450
[The sad reality of being in last place.]

224
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:16,500
[Gary's new position in
seventh place- Confirmed.]

225
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,860
<i>We will now start the second round.</i>

226
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:28,130
<i>For the second round...</i>

227
00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:29,980
<i>sixth place will compete
against fifth place</i>

228
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:31,960
<i>fourth place against third place</i>

229
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:36,300
<i>and second place will compete against first
place for a chance to take over their position.</i>

230
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:38,220
That's Kim Jong Kook.

231
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:40,500
<i>If the sixth place holder loses
this round...</i>

232
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,370
<i>that person will establish
their spot as the sixth place holder</i>

233
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:45,300
<i>and will no longer have any more chances
to move up from their position.</i>

234
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:46,880
So it's all over for me if I lose this?

235
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,590
<i>You may now board the elevator.</i>

236
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:51,860
There are five people left to go.

237
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:59,500
I'm going to make it up to
the very top.

238
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:02,310
I'm going to put
everything I have on the line.

239
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:11,680
I wonder who'll be on this floor.

240
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,380
You scared me.

241
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:19,490
- Hey!
- Ji Hyo, you're in fifth place?

242
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:21,820
Are you in sixth place?
Were you in sixth place to begin with?

243
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,350
No, I moved up from seventh place.

244
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:26,720
[Third place holder, Big-nose
vs. Fourth place holder, Ha Ha.]

245
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,870
Have you been well?
Mr. Third Place Holder?

246
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:35,470
[Kkuk arrives at the very top floor.]

247
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,710
Muscle boy!

248
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:39,850
Hey, Muscle Boy.

249
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:44,550
[Muscle Boy makes it up
all the way to the top floor.]

250
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,730
Welcome, Muscle Boy.

251
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:50,690
Why are you going around
twitching your shoulders like that?

252
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:53,090
I guess you've been watching
everything that's been going on?

253
00:14:53,090 --> 00:14:54,950
I have been watching all that's been
going on since I'm in first place

254
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:56,870
and I had a steak for breakfast too.

255
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,160
Ah, I see.
What kind of a steak is that?

256
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,130
Is that the best they had for you?

257
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:05,190
While I was down there eating my bean jelly
amongst all the trash cans...

258
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:06,580
Did you have more bean jelly?

259
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:07,930
They're really good.

260
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:10,480
I had five of those things.

261
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:15,960
- They're about to make an announcement.
- We will now start the second round.

262
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:19,240
<i>For your second game...</i>

263
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:22,280
<i>For your second game...</i>

264
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,960
<i>you will play a round of the
hand slap game.</i>

265
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:28,690
<i>It's the hand slap game.</i>

266
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:32,530
<i>You will take turns slapping
the tops of each other's hands</i>

267
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:36,290
<i>and the first person to scream out loud
from the pain will lose this game.</i>

268
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:41,140
- Your next game will be the hand slap game.
- What kind of absurdity is this?

269
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:43,700
How does this make any sense?

270
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:46,590
Let's talk about this first.
This game is absolutely ridiculous!

271
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:49,320
- You will now start the game.
- I'm good at enduring my pain.

272
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:52,400
- I'm confidant I'll win this.
- Five.

273
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:57,190
<i>Four, three, two, one.</i>

274
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:58,620
This is insane.

275
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:02,320
Look at his arms.
Have you seen his arms?

276
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,990
Let me give you a tip.

277
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,360
You need to knock me out
with your first hit.

278
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,210
[He's telling Jae Suk to knock him out
with the first attack?]

279
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:10,620
I don't know about this.

280
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:13,060
If I can't get him in one shot,
then it's all over for me.

281
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,550
This isn't the arm of a human being!

282
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:27,730
Why are you getting all tense about this?
Can't you loosen up your hand a bit?

283
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:41,760
[It seems as though Yoo Hyuk is in
more pain for having slapped Jong Kook.]

284
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,460
My hand is a little sweaty today
from this heat.

285
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:46,800
- I feel like... it's going to be a good slap.
- I'm in trouble.

286
00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:48,890
- Doesn't it even hurt?
- No, it doesn't hurt.

287
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:55,440
[Preparing himself for the slap.]

288
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,720
[Cringing at Jong Kook's hand movement.]

289
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,090
- What's wrong?
- What?

290
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:05,820
Why did you pretend like
you were going to hit me?

291
00:17:05,830 --> 00:17:07,210
Fine, I'll slap you.

292
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:09,460
It's not going to hurt as much
as you think.

293
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:17,300
[Falling apart at the seams from
Muscle Boy's spike slap.]

294
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:22,590
[Silent gasps of pain due to the
inability to scream out loud.]

295
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:26,730
What's wrong?

296
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,590
Here.

297
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:34,320
This is seriously...

298
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:39,220
Here I go.

299
00:17:56,530 --> 00:17:57,950
Ugh, my palm is burning.

300
00:17:57,950 --> 00:18:00,070
Ugh, my palm hurts even more.

301
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:04,120
[Fourth place vs. Third place-
Slapping each other's hands with glee.]

302
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:12,230
[Slapping each other back and forth
without any rest in between.]

303
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:24,500
[Sixth place vs. Fifth place-
Back and forth as expected.]

304
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:34,540
[Second floor on fire.]

305
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:43,510
Scream if it hurts.

306
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:45,090
Just scream if it hurts.

307
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:48,590
Call out your father's name, or your
brother's name. Just scream out loud!

308
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:50,640
I want to scream out so badly!

309
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,680
[It's Muscle Boy's turn to
attack on the sixth floor.]

310
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:19,310
[A slam dunk!]

311
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:21,770
He avoided it!

312
00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:23,630
He avoided my slap.

313
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,380
He avoided the slap!

314
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:30,730
He avoided the slap and I was
only able to hit him right here.

315
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:32,080
That hurts!

316
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:34,620
It hurts like you can't even imagine!

317
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:37,290
Look at my hand!
Look at the state my hand is in!

318
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:38,990
I don't think that was a proper slap,
so let's do it over.

319
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,800
- You can start.
- I just screamed out in pain!

320
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:43,630
I screamed out loud.

321
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,530
[Admitting that he screamed out loud.]

322
00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:47,750
- It hurts! Hurts!
- I didn't really hear him.

323
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:50,050
I can't do this!

324
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:53,100
[Taking it upon himself to switch out their
tags indicating their order.]

325
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:54,820
But I really didn't hear you
scream out loud.

326
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:56,570
- I screamed! You take it!
- But, it wasn't a proper slap!

327
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:58,200
Let go.
Let go of it.

328
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:01,840
[Second floor exchanging slaps
at a lightning fast speed.]

329
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,220
[Slapping himself in the face?]

330
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:08,710
You can't do that.

331
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:10,070
Let's switch hands.

332
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:14,200
Does it hurt?
Scream if your hand is hurting you.

333
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,000
It really tickles, and it's hard
for me to endure the laughter.

334
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,340
Really?
Then let's keep going.

335
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:19,110
It hurts.

336
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:21,150
Let's switch hands.

337
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:24,210
Here.
Me first?

338
00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:26,840
[Starting over after having
switched out their hands.]

339
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:31,960
[A fierce battle because neither one of them
wants to be confirmed in sixth place.]

340
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:36,550
[Already on their 50th slap
on the fourth floor.]

341
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,850
Fine, I lost!
Hey!

342
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:46,780
[Big-nose throwing in the towel
from all the agony.]

343
00:20:48,210 --> 00:20:50,360
How old are you?
How old are you!

344
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:55,960
[Still in the midst of their slap battle.]

345
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:04,370
[Explodes out in suppressed screams.]

346
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:06,140
- It hurts!
- How much!

347
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:08,290
I feel like I'm going to die
from the pain!

348
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:10,600
This was already a
lost game from the beginning!

349
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:13,910
- I'm hurting too!
- I'm going to stay on the 6th floor forever!

350
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,870
[Kwang Soo fails his attempt to
move up any further in rank.]

351
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:19,860
Do you think that you'll be able to maintain
your first place position forever?

352
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:21,630
I did it!

353
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:25,060
[Ha Ha moves up to third place in rank.]

354
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:27,680
- Third place!
- Things are looking worse and worse.

355
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,810
Things are looking worse by the floor.

356
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:35,400
[Kwang Soo confirms his spot in
sixth place from his basement origin.]

357
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:41,770
Are we going?

358
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:44,270
Heading towards second place in rank.

359
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:46,420
Let's go!

360
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:53,190
Moving up like this isn't
a bad feeling.

361
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:58,330
[Just who could be waiting for him
up on the sixth floor?]

362
00:21:58,330 --> 00:21:59,930
Is it Jong Kook?

363
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:14,710
Those are Jong Kook's shoes.

364
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:15,940
It's me.

365
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:19,940
- Welcome.
- It's you?

366
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:21,780
[The bickering brothers facing each other
for the second place rank.]

367
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:23,580
- Welcome.
- Let me see your hand.

368
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:26,130
[Hiding his right hand which is
beet red from the slapping.]

369
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:28,570
Oh my, look at how red it is.
Wow, Jae Suk.

370
00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:31,230
Your hand looks bruised.

371
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:33,000
- Can you guess who it was?
- Jong Kook.

372
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,560
Your place...

373
00:22:37,410 --> 00:22:38,560
is seventh place.

374
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:40,570
You've come too far up.

375
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:44,920
Do you know how this is ranked?
I'm asking if you know that.

376
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:47,600
- Isn't it in order of debut date?
- No, the face.

377
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,540
You're about fifth place in that.

378
00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:52,270
Yeah, you're in fifth place.

379
00:22:55,410 --> 00:22:59,170
<i>This round will determine who will be
confirmed in fifth place in ranking.</i>

380
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:02,420
<i>It's the Egg Roulette Game.</i>

381
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:05,970
- It's an Egg Roulette Game.
- Egg Roulette?

382
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:09,120
<i>You will take turns to cracking eggs
with your head...</i>

383
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,340
Ah, we have to find the raw egg?

384
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:14,260
<i>And I'm sure you can figure out
who loses the game when that time comes.</i>

385
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:15,350
This is all about luck.

386
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:17,840
You should've had us playing this game
when I was facing off with Jong Kook!

387
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:20,540
<i>Two, one, start.</i>

388
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:24,390
[Basking in the comfort of the top floor.]

389
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:26,370
Yes, thank you.

390
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,000
[The cool and refreshing taste
of being in first place.]

391
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,100
The water is so cool and refreshing.
What amazing service.

392
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:36,970
You don't have to do all that.

393
00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:40,230
Egg roulette?

394
00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:43,230
What if Jae Suk comes back up here?

395
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:45,510
Seriously... he's lucky like that.

396
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,260
Who goes first?

397
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:50,200
[Person with the higher position
in ranking gets to go first.]

398
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,340
Can't be.
Can't be it already.

399
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:54,370
- First blow.
- Let's just be cool about this.

400
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:55,610
Let's just be cool about it.

401
00:23:56,690 --> 00:23:57,860
Okay!

402
00:24:00,670 --> 00:24:01,910
What if this is the one?

403
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:05,470
I worked so hard to get up here.

404
00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:08,070
- Let it be the raw egg, let it be...
- Who dares to try to kick me out now?

405
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:11,420
[If he wins this round, he'll be
moving up to second place in rank!]

406
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:19,150
Come on, come on, come on!

407
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:21,840
Okay, come on!

408
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,600
[Will it be the raw egg?]

409
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,160
Come on!

410
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:28,060
Please.

411
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:31,850
[Hardboiled egg...]

412
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:38,210
[Fifth place and Fourth place-
Third floor is also cracking away.]

413
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:43,120
This is all about the luck of the draw.

414
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:47,120
[A dull thud?]

415
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,050
You have to smack it really hard
for it not to hurt on your head.

416
00:24:49,850 --> 00:24:51,880
[Again!]

417
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:54,730
Why are you having such a hard time
cracking that open?

418
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:06,700
Come on, come on, come on!

419
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:17,700
[Back to Yoo Hyuk's turn.]

420
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,960
This is the game that I should've played
against Kim Jong Kook.

421
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:35,450
I won!

422
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:38,040
I'm number two!

423
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:41,970
Two, two, two!

424
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:44,970
Look at you.

425
00:25:44,970 --> 00:25:46,670
You did great.

426
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:50,080
You've been up here way too long.

427
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,000
I won!

428
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,960
Third place!

429
00:26:11,050 --> 00:26:12,570
Song Ji Hyo!

430
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:15,480
You've done great.

431
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,220
Why don't we grab dinner
together sometime?

432
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:19,860
Just remember that this
isn't the end.

433
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:24,320
- There will be another chance!
- What did you say, Mr. Third Place?

434
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:27,300
I'm so annoyed!

435
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:38,680
<i>I'm not going to let them
get away with this.</i>

436
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:42,580
Everyone has to hit the bottom
before they climb back up in their lives.

437
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:46,800
I really hate to say this...

438
00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:49,820
but this place isn't
all that different from my house.

439
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:52,350
I have bean jelly at home too.

440
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,810
What's with all these flies!

441
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:01,230
Suk Jin won the game?

442
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:03,160
Wow, that's unbelievable.

443
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,350
Okay!

444
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:06,110
[Going back up a floor.]

445
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:10,760
Who knew the eggs would help
me out like that?

446
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:13,430
The eggs were a great help.

447
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:15,830
I love eggs!

448
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:19,340
I have to win this round.
I have to win it this time.

449
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:26,730
- You're in third place?
- Welcome.

450
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:28,220
Did you fall from first place?

451
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:30,450
Which spot did you fall from?

452
00:27:31,810 --> 00:27:34,670
[Fourth and Third Place holders
warming up for their next game.]

453
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:42,160
- I feel strangely confident.
- I feel good about this round.

454
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,800
I know I can beat Suk Jin.

455
00:27:43,810 --> 00:27:45,720
Hey, Ji Hyo was overly confident
and lost too.

456
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,620
Oh my... nice to see you again.

457
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,760
Climbing up is a hobby of mine.

458
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:58,420
[Haroro taking on the first floor
after having started in fourth place.]

459
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:01,630
Come here, kiddo.

460
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,660
Mr. Jong Kook.

461
00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:12,550
What's going on here?
Oh, you can see everything from here?

462
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:13,700
Yeah, I enjoyed watching you guys.

463
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:15,870
Then I guess I can sit there and
watch once I'm first place?

464
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:20,610
You've climbed up too high in the rank,
which doesn't really suit you.

465
00:28:22,770 --> 00:28:26,500
[First place and Second place holders'
tight mental battle.]

466
00:28:27,850 --> 00:28:29,470
<i>Your fourth round mission is...</i>

467
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:33,130
<i>Put on the workpants without
the use of your hands.</i>

468
00:28:33,130 --> 00:28:34,300
What?

469
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:36,030
<i>Put on the workpants without
the use of your hands.</i>

470
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:37,090
- Huh?
- What?

471
00:28:40,330 --> 00:28:42,010
But we have to do this while lying down?

472
00:28:42,010 --> 00:28:43,670
[But it has to be done on top
of the acupuncture mat.]

473
00:28:44,570 --> 00:28:46,310
I'm feeling pretty competitive today.

474
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:49,000
Okay, you're feeling confident,
but you're still in fourth place.

475
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:50,920
I'm going to keep climbing up.

476
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:01,380
[Screaming out in pain
the moment the game starts.]

477
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:07,500
[Starting to interfere in each other's
progress in order to maintain their spot.]

478
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:13,200
[A child-like fight between the two
40-something men.]

479
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:24,640
Okay, this is good.

480
00:29:24,650 --> 00:29:26,370
- This is good.
- This is not really happening.

481
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:30,680
[Oh... already?]

482
00:29:31,650 --> 00:29:34,880
[The key is to get the pants
past their hips.]

483
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:37,810
Ouch, that hurts!

484
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:43,720
[Are they trying to launder the pants?]

485
00:29:47,270 --> 00:29:48,660
You need to hike them up
another three cm.

486
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:53,250
Where's the opening to these pants?

487
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:58,570
[Taking over Suk Jin's workpants!]

488
00:30:01,810 --> 00:30:04,320
Thanks, Suk Jin.
Thanks.

489
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:11,570
[Throws him off.]

490
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:18,320
[Even breaking down into a belly dance
in an attempt to hike up the pants.]

491
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:27,820
[Utilizing any sharp points.]

492
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:29,180
Sorry, Suk Jin.

493
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:30,700
I have no other choice right now.

494
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,970
- Seriously!
- How can I hike these up?

495
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:40,600
[Suk Jin's legs?]

496
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,840
[Exhaustion hits.]

497
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,120
I got it.

498
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:51,590
I got them on.

499
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:54,990
[Yoo Hyuk wins.]

500
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:56,950
Thanks for your help.

501
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:03,530
[Suk Jin's position
confirmed in fourth place.]

502
00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:07,210
[Working themselves into a frenzy.]

503
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:10,320
[On the acupuncture mat,
known to be good for blood circulation.]

504
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:14,190
[Just who will take the first place?]

505
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:15,270
I got it!

506
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:22,910
[Ha Ha wins!]

507
00:31:24,670 --> 00:31:30,070
[A personal win! Takes over first place
after having started out in fourth place!]

508
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:33,730
I'm number one!

509
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:39,220
[Yoo Hyuk, currently in third place
goes back up a floor to second.]

510
00:31:40,430 --> 00:31:42,380
Please, anyone but Kim Jong Kook.

511
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:45,760
[But his opponent is...]

512
00:31:46,550 --> 00:31:47,860
There you are.

513
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:49,850
- Listen...
- You're here.

514
00:31:49,850 --> 00:31:53,400
- Did you lose to the kiddo?
- The kiddo has a lower butt than I do.

515
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:55,630
You'd better get yourself ready
to go down a level.

516
00:31:55,630 --> 00:31:58,100
- You can just keep that tag on.
- What did you say?

517
00:31:58,100 --> 00:31:59,920
- What did you say?
- I'm just going to end it for you here.

518
00:31:59,930 --> 00:32:02,340
This hand still doesn't feel like
my own hand!

519
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:03,660
Let me see.

520
00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:05,930
What's wrong with your hand?

521
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:08,670
<i>It's now time to determine who
will be in third place.</i>

522
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:10,940
<i>Your next mission...</i>

523
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,920
Let's do a game like the egg game.

524
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:15,050
<i>Is one-on-one table tennis.</i>

525
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:18,520
- Table tennis?
- Instead of your normal tennis racket...

526
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,990
<i>you're going to use other items to
hit the tennis ball.</i>

527
00:32:22,030 --> 00:32:24,460
<i>The first person to score seven points
wins the game.</i>

528
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:27,070
- Then do I get to choose the prop first?
- What did you say?

529
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:31,540
[Kkuk gets to choose the prop first
for being higher up in rank.]

530
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:36,380
- This one looks good.
- Once you grab it, you have to stick with it.

531
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:38,140
- What are you talking about?
- You have to stick with that one now.

532
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:39,860
I think this would be good for attacking.

533
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:42,100
[Second place Kkuk being meticulous
about which prop he chooses.]

534
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:44,110
- But for playing defense, maybe this one?
- Come on.

535
00:32:45,050 --> 00:32:46,730
Maybe this will be better?

536
00:32:46,730 --> 00:32:48,870
Maybe this would be better for it.

537
00:32:48,870 --> 00:32:50,920
When you were slapping my hand earlier...

538
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:52,990
your hand felt like a frying pan.

539
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:56,690
[Second place holder Kkuk chooses
the hand fan.]

540
00:32:56,690 --> 00:32:57,870
I'll go with this one.

541
00:32:57,870 --> 00:32:59,820
[Third place holder Yoo Hyuk chooses
to go with the frying pan.]

542
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:01,010
Here I go.

543
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:07,280
Okay, let's start.

544
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:11,790
That's right!

545
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:14,170
[Yoo Hyuk- 1 vs. Kkuk- 0.]

546
00:33:14,610 --> 00:33:16,950
- This has no strength.
- This puts a spin on the ball.

547
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:18,850
This thing has a spin to it.

548
00:33:18,850 --> 00:33:19,930
Give me the ball.

549
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:23,330
- You made a bad decision.
- This has no power. I have to hit it hard.

550
00:33:24,290 --> 00:33:25,580
That's right!

551
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:29,150
[Yoo Hyuk- 2 vs. Kkuk- 0.]

552
00:33:29,150 --> 00:33:31,430
- Hurry up and do it.
- Okay.

553
00:33:31,790 --> 00:33:33,420
- It's two to one, right?
- Yes.

554
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:37,940
[Yoo Hyuk- 2 vs. Kkuk- 1]

555
00:33:44,450 --> 00:33:45,700
Ah! Two to two!

556
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:47,840
[Yoo Hyuk- 2 vs. Kkuk- 2]

557
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:49,390
I'm used to this now!

558
00:33:54,390 --> 00:33:57,250
[Yoo Hyuk- 4 vs. Kkuk- 3]

559
00:33:58,360 --> 00:33:59,890
That's right!

560
00:33:59,890 --> 00:34:01,720
- There's nothing to this.
- That's right!

561
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:03,020
That's right!

562
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:06,270
[Yoo Hyuk- 5 vs. Kkuk- 3]

563
00:34:06,270 --> 00:34:07,640
You and I are a great fit.

564
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:09,500
There's no need to put too much
strength behind this.

565
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,580
Let's go.

566
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:16,560
That's right!

567
00:34:17,950 --> 00:34:20,770
[Yoo Hyuk- 6 vs. Kkuk- 3]

568
00:34:20,770 --> 00:34:21,870
- This is the last point.
- I know!

569
00:34:21,870 --> 00:34:23,630
- This is the game point.
- Let's go.

570
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:29,520
[Yoo Hyuk- 6 vs. Kkuk- 4]

571
00:34:36,630 --> 00:34:38,970
[A spike serve!]

572
00:34:42,070 --> 00:34:43,440
Awesome.

573
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:46,080
Don't hold yourself back, Jong Kook.
Don't hold yourself back.

574
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:48,350
- I can't believe how this is turning out.
- I'm good under pressure.

575
00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:50,110
Let's play real table tennis now, Jong Kook.
Real table tennis.

576
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,670
Just think of this as a
regular table tennis game.

577
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:00,230
[An ambush attack?]

578
00:35:06,570 --> 00:35:08,990
[He fails at his trick attack.]

579
00:35:11,790 --> 00:35:13,080
Wow, that was amazing.

580
00:35:13,090 --> 00:35:14,600
Okay, it's a deuce.

581
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:17,490
[Yoo Hyuk- 6 vs. Kkuk- 6.
Deuce.]

582
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:21,480
Who am I, and what's going on here?
Don't you know what a deuce is?

583
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:28,000
It's impossible to predict who'll win.

584
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,820
Just get going!

585
00:35:36,490 --> 00:35:39,220
I'm going to end it this time.
Let's just end it here, Jong Kook.

586
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:40,710
Just take it easy.

587
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:44,440
- Take it easy.
- That's right!

588
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:46,700
[Yoo Hyuk- 7 vs. Kkuk- 7.
An even score again!]

589
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:49,530
- Just take it easy, okay?
- What happened?

590
00:35:49,530 --> 00:35:50,920
- This is a little slow.
- That was good.

591
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:53,090
I feel like we're at
the Olympics right now.

592
00:35:53,890 --> 00:35:56,460
[Running Man's bitter rivals-
Hyuk and Kkuk.]

593
00:35:56,470 --> 00:36:00,060
[Who knew that sparks would be flying
during the table tennis match like this?]

594
00:36:07,610 --> 00:36:10,090
[Pulling out all the moves- Unbelievable.]

595
00:36:10,090 --> 00:36:14,120
You don't even see that move very often
during the Olympics.

596
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:16,630
[A surprise attack while Kkuk is
too busy talking.]

597
00:36:16,630 --> 00:36:18,600
[But he catches the serve!]

598
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:23,970
That's not a move that you
see very often.

599
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,630
I won!

600
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:36,350
[7 vs. 9.
Kkuk wins!]

601
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:38,980
[Enraged...]

602
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:41,260
I can't believe I lost.

603
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:44,030
- I guess I'll be going back up now.
- There was even the cheating.

604
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:46,350
What did you say?
You're the one who cheated.

605
00:36:46,350 --> 00:36:48,270
That's what I mean.
I cheated.

606
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,350
You're the one who cheated!

607
00:36:49,350 --> 00:36:51,600
According to the rules... I should've waited
to serve when he was ready.

608
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,240
- But I jumped the gun on that.
- It's okay, I can let that go.

609
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:55,530
<i>In that case, we'll declare that
you lost by cheating.</i>

610
00:36:57,620 --> 00:36:59,580
I seriously can't believe I lost!

611
00:37:00,890 --> 00:37:03,400
It looks like I'll be competing
against Mr. Jong Kook again.

612
00:37:03,870 --> 00:37:06,170
[Yoo Hyuk confirmed for third place.]

613
00:37:06,170 --> 00:37:07,800
Seriously... I went easy on you.

614
00:37:09,410 --> 00:37:12,090
- That was an unbelievable win.
- I still can't believe I lost!

615
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:15,150
I could've won that game.

616
00:37:21,770 --> 00:37:24,770
<i>We will now move on to
the final round.</i>

617
00:37:25,450 --> 00:37:28,550
<i>This final round... is the playoff round.</i>

618
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:31,240
<i>This round will determine the first and
second place holder in rank</i>

619
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:33,410
<i>and the person who wins this game</i>

620
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:36,640
<i>will take over first place in rank
for the time being.</i>

621
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:41,190
I have to play with the kiddo again?

622
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:45,450
[In the midst of dining?]

623
00:37:45,450 --> 00:37:47,270
Seriously...

624
00:37:49,870 --> 00:37:51,660
Wait just a little bit longer.

625
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:53,350
I'm almost finished with my meal.

626
00:37:56,230 --> 00:37:57,790
This is a great meal.

627
00:37:58,430 --> 00:38:00,660
So you made your way
back up here?

628
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:03,240
Well, since the seat belonged to me
in the first place...

629
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:07,550
[The last final round which will determine
who will take over first place in rank.]

630
00:38:07,550 --> 00:38:08,900
- You did great work.
- Yes.

631
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:11,100
- This is your final round.
- Yes.

632
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:13,520
<i>No matter who wins between
the two of you</i>

633
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:17,080
<i>the person who comes in at second place
must be completely obedient of the winner.</i>

634
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:22,070
<i>The first place winner will be determined
by a round of table tennis ball toss.</i>

635
00:38:22,530 --> 00:38:24,540
[Table tennis ball toss.]

636
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:28,010
The first person to toss the ball
into the wine glass...

637
00:38:28,010 --> 00:38:30,260
[The first person to bounce the ball and
land it in the wineglass wins the game.]

638
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:33,840
Just think about it lightly.
This game is advantageous for you.

639
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:40,270
[The other members with confirmed ranks
join to watch the match.]

640
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:42,220
I should be the one playing in this round.

641
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:44,490
[Haroro's attempt to take over first place
that surprises everyone.]

642
00:38:44,490 --> 00:38:49,310
But how did we get ranked when we
first got here anyways?

643
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:51,300
- Isn't it in the order of our debut?
- Our debut years?

644
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:53,260
[It was determined in the order
of your variety debut.]

645
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:55,920
Ah, variety show debut?

646
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,570
Variety show debut date.

647
00:38:57,570 --> 00:38:59,780
[Must score the ball
in this wine glass to win.]

648
00:39:00,270 --> 00:39:02,970
The person who wins first place right now,
will have one chance

649
00:39:02,970 --> 00:39:06,230
to chance to change the order
between third and seventh place holders.

650
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:08,750
- They can change their spots?
- Only the first place winner?

651
00:39:10,130 --> 00:39:11,860
I'm going to have to win this.
- Wow.

652
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:14,510
Then does it mean that he can switch
from seventh to third position?

653
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:15,900
Yes, he can do that.

654
00:39:15,910 --> 00:39:17,780
[Possible to switch from
seventh to third place.]

655
00:39:18,410 --> 00:39:21,380
- Kim Jong Kook! Kim Jong Kook!
- Ha Ha! Ha Ha!

656
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:23,940
- Kim Jong Kook!
- Ha Ha!

657
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:26,920
Excuse me, Mr. Jae Suk?
Can you hand me one too?

658
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:29,260
- Yes, no problem.
- Oh my, I dropped my balls.

659
00:39:33,450 --> 00:39:35,670
[Transformation-
A smart Kwang-retriever.]

660
00:39:38,030 --> 00:39:39,870
[You must be hot!]

661
00:39:41,010 --> 00:39:42,480
[Ha Ha takes the first turn.]

662
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:45,320
[Very close, but misses!]

663
00:39:45,890 --> 00:39:47,730
- Here you go, I wiped it up for you.
- Okay.

664
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:51,000
[Kwang-retriever following Ha Ha
around like a loyal puppy.]

665
00:39:52,410 --> 00:39:53,880
[Kkuk's turn.]

666
00:39:55,270 --> 00:39:57,980
[Not even close...]

667
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:01,300
I'm sorry.

668
00:40:01,750 --> 00:40:03,890
[Kwang-retriever playing havoc
with Kkuk's mental state.]

669
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,480
Think of this as your last chance.

670
00:40:16,850 --> 00:40:19,640
[That was so close!]

671
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:22,410
- This is making me nervous.
- This isn't an easy shot.

672
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:26,870
[On the other hand, it seems like Kkuk
still hasn't gotten the feel for it.]

673
00:40:27,710 --> 00:40:29,460
I think I'm getting the feel for it.

674
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:33,710
[Suggesting that they divide
up the cheer crowd.]

675
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:37,410
[Huh?
Gary's standing behind Kkuk?]

676
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:41,660
I've always stood behind Jong Kook.

677
00:40:50,570 --> 00:40:53,580
[Again, that was so close!]

678
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:55,630
- Where are you going, Gary?
- I've always stood right back here.

679
00:40:55,630 --> 00:40:57,710
[Seventh place holder Gary sliding over
to stand behind Ha Ha?]

680
00:41:00,890 --> 00:41:02,860
It's okay, it's okay.
I know I can do this.

681
00:41:05,610 --> 00:41:07,390
[It seems as though Ro-Ro has gotten
a total hang of this game.]

682
00:41:07,390 --> 00:41:09,110
We're all dead if you don't win this.

683
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:19,740
[Continuing on with the close call shots.]

684
00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:21,430
I got it now.
I know what I have to do now.

685
00:41:21,430 --> 00:41:22,560
Here I go.

686
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:29,120
[Thus, they kept on repeating their
moves over and over again...]

687
00:41:29,370 --> 00:41:31,120
<i>Since the glass is a bit small...</i>

688
00:41:31,150 --> 00:41:34,630
<i>we will switch it out to a larger glass
with the current first place to make it fair.</i>

689
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:36,340
- Sounds good.
- With that one?

690
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:38,700
[Switching out the glass for a container
with a wider mouth.]

691
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:41,260
[With this turn of events, the
next shot could determine the winner!]

692
00:41:44,470 --> 00:41:47,430
[Yet again, another very close call!]

693
00:41:49,770 --> 00:41:52,360
[The winner could be determined
with just one shot!]

694
00:41:55,530 --> 00:41:56,910
You have to score it now!

695
00:41:59,810 --> 00:42:01,260
Can you move all the way down?

696
00:42:05,010 --> 00:42:06,850
What is this?
This ball is crushed.

697
00:42:06,850 --> 00:42:07,900
I'm sorry.

698
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:12,280
[He handed him a crushed ball...]

699
00:42:12,770 --> 00:42:15,450
He really is trying to undermine
my chances of winning.

700
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:17,180
[Kwang-retriever's unabashed attempt to
interfere in Jong Kook's game.]

701
00:42:18,670 --> 00:42:20,310
I totally lost the feel for it.

702
00:42:21,150 --> 00:42:22,230
Challenge.

703
00:42:26,970 --> 00:42:29,680
[Again!]

704
00:42:34,910 --> 00:42:37,230
[The end seems imminent for this match!]

705
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:39,130
They both have the feel for it.

706
00:42:39,410 --> 00:42:40,660
Challenge.

707
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:45,210
There you go!

708
00:42:47,570 --> 00:42:48,790
There you go!

709
00:42:48,790 --> 00:42:50,570
[He scores!]

710
00:43:00,230 --> 00:43:01,540
Come here, Mister.

711
00:43:03,570 --> 00:43:04,570
Mister.

712
00:43:04,570 --> 00:43:06,970
[Explodes at Yoo Hyuk whom he's had
a lot of pent up grudges against.]

713
00:43:10,150 --> 00:43:12,540
I'm number one!

714
00:43:13,290 --> 00:43:16,140
[Lower rank people all gathering
around Ha Ha.]

715
00:43:16,990 --> 00:43:19,580
Excuse me, you all need to
apologize to him.

716
00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:21,380
You all need to apologize to him!

717
00:43:22,610 --> 00:43:24,220
Everyone line up in front of me.

718
00:43:26,050 --> 00:43:27,360
Seriously.

719
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:30,580
<i>As I have told you earlier,
people that are in third to seventh place...</i>

720
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:33,660
<i>the first place winner can switch
one person out of their position.</i>

721
00:43:33,930 --> 00:43:35,760
Please, Sir!

722
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:38,470
I really want to switch out one of you.

723
00:43:38,470 --> 00:43:41,070
Both of you were a lot of help to me.

724
00:43:41,070 --> 00:43:43,950
- I really believed in you.
- I was behind you from the beginning.

725
00:43:43,950 --> 00:43:46,060
[Feeling nervous.]

726
00:43:46,060 --> 00:43:47,680
I really don't want to go
down any further.

727
00:43:49,220 --> 00:43:54,060
Kang Gary and Yoo Jae Suk,
switch your positions.

728
00:43:54,060 --> 00:43:58,040
[With the authority of first position holder,
third and seventh position swaps spots.]

729
00:43:58,570 --> 00:44:00,190
Was I being too obvious?

730
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:02,280
I don't know if that was
too obvious of a move.

731
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:03,800
I won't let you get away with this.

732
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:06,090
I can't go down any further than this!

733
00:44:06,090 --> 00:44:08,340
- What did you just say?
- What are you going to do about it now?

734
00:44:08,340 --> 00:44:10,460
[Seventh place holder exploding in rage.]

735
00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:12,450
I can't fall any further from
where I'm at!

736
00:44:12,460 --> 00:44:14,850
- What are you going to do?
- You just wait and see.

737
00:44:14,850 --> 00:44:17,250
Don't tell me what to do!

738
00:44:17,250 --> 00:44:18,940
- Do I tell you what to do?
- There's nothing else you can do to me now!

739
00:44:18,940 --> 00:44:22,050
- I'm your boss!
- How are you my boss?

740
00:44:22,050 --> 00:44:24,000
- I am your boss!
- How do you think that you're my boss?

741
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,830
- Please keep your composure.
- Okay, I understand.

742
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:29,760
<i>I will now reveal to you the differences
between all the ranks.</i>

743
00:44:29,770 --> 00:44:32,720
[Everything from this point on will be
determined by their position in rank.]

744
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:35,110
<i>You all have to take very good care
of your own things.</i>

745
00:44:35,110 --> 00:44:37,260
You need to experience what it's
like to hit rock bottom.

746
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:40,420
I want you all to observe how I'll use this
to work my way back up to the top.

747
00:44:40,420 --> 00:44:42,390
I have six.

748
00:44:42,390 --> 00:44:44,650
[Gold coins that are distributed
according to the ranked position.]

749
00:44:44,650 --> 00:44:47,240
This gold in my hand looks so good after
having looked at bean jelly for so long.

750
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:50,920
<i>You will continue to earn your
gold coins in this manner.</i>

751
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:55,190
<i>You will continue to play for rank.
We will now move on to the lunch segment.</i>

752
00:44:55,190 --> 00:44:58,360
[Off to dine!]

753
00:45:00,370 --> 00:45:05,500
[First round of Snow Elevator-
Currently ranked positions.]

754
00:45:05,510 --> 00:45:09,830
[The icy locale...
suddenly transforms into summer.]

755
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:12,420
Gary just proved that one single moment
can change a person's life.

756
00:45:12,980 --> 00:45:16,680
Don't you remember how I told you all
that I'm going to turn my life around?

757
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:19,010
Playing all those countless games
isn't the point here.

758
00:45:19,010 --> 00:45:20,950
Who knew that Gary would work himself
up to third place like that?

759
00:45:20,950 --> 00:45:23,630
Do you know how good it feels to have
Jae Suk below me in standing right now?

760
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:26,320
You have no idea what that means.
You and I always gets beat by him.

761
00:45:27,210 --> 00:45:29,870
Right now is your chance.
Take your opportunity.

762
00:45:29,870 --> 00:45:31,360
[All the shame and indignity
that they've been put through...]

763
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:37,560
[Something feels off about this...]

764
00:45:38,660 --> 00:45:41,860
It must feel so uncomfortable for you to
have me above you like this.

765
00:45:43,150 --> 00:45:45,750
- This position is uncomfortable for me.
- Listen, Kwang Soo.

766
00:45:45,750 --> 00:45:48,570
Are you kidding me?
What are you doing over there?

767
00:45:48,570 --> 00:45:50,500
- Listen, seventh place holder?
- Yes?

768
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:52,930
What kind of a brutish behavior
are you exhibiting right now?

769
00:45:57,220 --> 00:45:59,150
Seventh place holder just shoved me!

770
00:45:59,780 --> 00:46:02,890
People without any future or hopes are the
ones you should watch out for the most.

771
00:46:04,070 --> 00:46:07,570
[First place holder trying to put
the order back into the rankings.]

772
00:46:07,570 --> 00:46:10,170
[Trying to enforce everyone back in line
according to their rank with a wrist slap.]

773
00:46:10,170 --> 00:46:12,220
- Don't judge us like this.
- Why don't we do this instead?

774
00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:13,890
Look at it this way, you can hit Jae Suk.

775
00:46:13,890 --> 00:46:15,730
Then do we do it in a relay?

776
00:46:15,730 --> 00:46:18,900
[Wrist slap to be done in a relay form
down the line in ranked position.]

777
00:46:18,910 --> 00:46:21,160
Okay, let's start.
Go ahead and hit me.

778
00:46:23,260 --> 00:46:24,610
Pass it on.

779
00:46:26,150 --> 00:46:28,710
[Is he actually passing that on?]

780
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:31,140
[Confused with what's going on.]

781
00:46:31,140 --> 00:46:33,340
I have no more room to fall
from where I'm standing right now.

782
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:34,820
- In that case...
- Yes?

783
00:46:34,820 --> 00:46:37,710
- You two swap your spots.
- Okay, that makes more sense.

784
00:46:39,550 --> 00:46:43,820
[Sixth place holder who behaved more like
seventh place holder ultimately...]

785
00:46:45,570 --> 00:46:47,200
[Outraged!]

786
00:46:50,150 --> 00:46:54,910
[Having the Giraffe be the youngest in
the group is desirable in many ways?]

787
00:46:55,830 --> 00:46:57,320
- Yes, this works.
- Pass it on.

788
00:46:57,320 --> 00:46:58,790
Are you out of your mind?

789
00:46:58,790 --> 00:47:02,670
[Teaching a stiff lesson to
the mannerless youngest member.]

790
00:47:02,670 --> 00:47:04,900
Don't you have any manners?

791
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:09,630
[Entering the diner after having confirmed
everyone's position in the rank.]

792
00:47:09,630 --> 00:47:10,810
I'm so hungry.

793
00:47:11,110 --> 00:47:14,270
[What kind of differential treatment
awaits them inside the restaurant?]

794
00:47:14,270 --> 00:47:15,720
- What is this?
- What kind of a meal is it?

795
00:47:15,730 --> 00:47:17,250
- What is this?
- They're all different.

796
00:47:18,550 --> 00:47:19,830
Wow, that's a traditional formal meal!

797
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:29,140
[This is the meal table for
the first place holder.]

798
00:47:31,030 --> 00:47:34,180
[Second place holder's menu.]

799
00:47:34,180 --> 00:47:36,640
[Third place winner's meal.]

800
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:38,440
I love seaweed soup!

801
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:42,760
Up to fifth place holder is pretty good.

802
00:47:50,020 --> 00:47:52,160
[Even though it's a humble affair,
their menu is still full of nutrition.]

803
00:47:52,430 --> 00:47:54,580
- Let's all sit down.
- This is amazing.

804
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:57,860
- Is that tuna?
- Ji Hyo's isn't bad either.

805
00:47:58,890 --> 00:48:03,120
[Seventh place holder, Kwang Soo's meal.]

806
00:48:04,950 --> 00:48:06,040
Dong Hoon.

807
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:09,720
Just be grateful that you even got that.

808
00:48:11,270 --> 00:48:13,340
I don't even get a chair?
I have to sit on this newspaper?

809
00:48:14,980 --> 00:48:19,160
[His own chef carefully grilling up
the meat for him on the grill.]

810
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:20,940
He's even grilling the meat for him?

811
00:48:21,350 --> 00:48:23,610
- Kwang Soo? Come here.
- Yes, Dong Hoon?

812
00:48:23,610 --> 00:48:25,310
- Excuse me?
- Come here.

813
00:48:26,430 --> 00:48:28,630
I feel bad about what happened,
so come over here.

814

[Even though it's a little late, is he
trying to reward Giraffe for his help?]

815
00:48:35,470 --> 00:48:36,790
Here, just take it.

816
00:48:38,550 --> 00:48:39,770
What are you doing?

817
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:42,080
- Was that not enough?
- What in the world is this?

818
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:45,250
[Big bro in first place slipping some
cabbage leaves over to his little bro.]

819
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:49,160
- Ha Ha's more generous than I thought.
- Thanks.

820
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:51,330
Can you pass some of the
meat down here?

821
00:48:52,210 --> 00:48:54,380
You sure are greedy down there!

822
00:48:54,380 --> 00:48:55,800
I'm sorry.

823
00:48:58,820 --> 00:49:00,630
I really like how this is playing out.

824

I really feel like I'm going to start
crying in the middle of my meal.

825
00:49:04,890 --> 00:49:06,180
Seriously!

826
00:49:06,180 --> 00:49:08,660
- Would you like one of my eggs, Jae Suk?
- Yes, sure!

827
00:49:08,660 --> 00:49:11,420
- Come here.
- That looks really good.

828
00:49:12,260 --> 00:49:14,070
- Can I eat this?
- Sure.

829

- You can take the whole egg.
- Thank you so much.

830
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:19,270
You want something too?

831
00:49:19,270 --> 00:49:20,930
- One of these?
- Yes, go ahead.

832
00:49:20,930 --> 00:49:22,350
Thank you!

833
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:26,110
I'll wear this in the suit pocket the
next time I have to attend a wedding.

834
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:30,860
- Hey, bring that egg over here.
- No, thanks.

835

Say something about how you feel.

1000
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:54,700
- What do you want me to say?
- It's way too hot in here!

1001
00:57:54,700 --> 00:57:56,950
I don't think that we should let this go.

1002
00:57:56,960 --> 00:57:58,910
The wind blowing outside is
making it even hotter in here.

1003
00:57:58,910 --> 00:58:02,050
[Having their windows open is only helping
to blow in all the hot air from outside.]

1004
00:58:05,020 --> 00:58:08,180
You have to use that camera to film me.

1005
00:58:08,190 --> 00:58:11,260
- My phone doesn't have much battery left.
- You have to use it to film me.

1006
00:58:11,270 --> 00:58:13,180
- Hello.
- Can we take a picture of you?

1007
00:58:13,180 --> 00:58:14,370
Yes, sure.

1008
00:58:14,370 --> 00:58:17,450
[With their windows rolled down, everyone
driving by can watch and be amused.]

1009
00:58:17,450 --> 00:58:20,790
How am I supposed to use this when you have
it password locked with a code I don't know?

1010
00:58:22,210 --> 00:58:24,910
[I guess that's the end of Kwang Soo's
face on this episode...]

1011
00:58:27,140 --> 00:58:28,500
Goodbye!

1012
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:32,540
[Pulling up right next to the upper crust
in their luxury car.]

1013
00:58:33,410 --> 00:58:34,890
That's just ridiculous.

1014
00:58:34,890 --> 00:58:36,930
- Wow!
- I'm so envious right now.

1015
00:58:36,930 --> 00:58:40,270
[Endless jealousy.]

1016
00:58:40,270 --> 00:58:43,140
[Nice and cool...]

1017
00:58:46,980 --> 00:58:49,940
[Giraffe trying to turn the
air conditioner on.]

1018
00:58:49,940 --> 00:58:53,620
No, don't do it!
You can't do that!

1019
00:58:55,050 --> 00:58:57,050
Don't turn the air conditioner on!

1020
00:58:57,050 --> 00:58:59,670
- You're going to get us stranded.
- I can't stand this heat!

1021
00:59:00,060 --> 00:59:02,080
What am I supposed to do when I
feel like I can't even breathe?

1022
00:59:02,620 --> 00:59:05,410
Kwang Soo, go get us some water.
Get us some ice water.

1023
00:59:05,410 --> 00:59:07,360
I don't have any money.

1024
00:59:08,110 --> 00:59:10,000
You have to film me with
that camera!

1025
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,340
Film Jae Suk.

1026
00:59:12,330 --> 00:59:14,350
I can't even roll my window
down over here.

1027
00:59:14,660 --> 00:59:15,930
Where are we going?

1028
00:59:16,860 --> 00:59:19,870
[No end in sight to their driving...]

1029
00:59:20,620 --> 00:59:22,390
How fast are you driving?

1030
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:25,680
You're only going 70km an hour
when the car is being this loud?

1031
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:27,410
This is...

1032
00:59:32,470 --> 00:59:35,300
Whenever anything passes by next to us,
it sounds like a tiger is roaring in my ear.

1033
00:59:37,420 --> 00:59:40,130
Every time a car passes by next to me,
it sounds like a huge roar.

1034
00:59:41,980 --> 00:59:43,960
[Are you still alive?]

1035
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:45,910
Hope you realize how lucky you
are right now.

1036
00:59:47,410 --> 00:59:49,370
Do you know how hot it is
in here right now?

1037
00:59:49,370 --> 00:59:51,900
[Taking his anger out on his VJ
who's riding in the car next to him.]

1038
00:59:52,750 --> 00:59:54,810
- We're here.
- Haven't we been here before?

1039
00:59:54,810 --> 00:59:57,020
- I think we were here before.
- You're right.

1040
00:59:57,030 --> 01:00:00,310
[Arriving at the tidal shore where
they wrestled Chu Sung Hoon.]

1041
01:00:00,310 --> 01:00:02,470
- This is that same tidal shore.
- Ugh, tidal shore.

1042
01:00:03,090 --> 01:00:07,100
[First through third place arrives at their
destination in comfort and ease.]

1043
01:00:08,100 --> 01:00:09,510
Do we have to change our clothes?

1044
01:00:10,230 --> 01:00:11,470
Wow, it's so hot.

1045
01:00:11,770 --> 01:00:13,460
- Kwang Soo.
- Yes, Jae Suk.

1046
01:00:13,460 --> 01:00:15,440
It feels a little bit cooler
when you open the door.

1047
01:00:15,840 --> 01:00:18,950
[Opening the door isn't going to
feel that much cooler.]

1048
01:00:19,730 --> 01:00:21,600
I'm just grateful that this car
even made it here.

1049
01:00:24,550 --> 01:00:26,990
[The Rank Determining Race-
Second mission location- Tidal Shore.]

1050
01:00:26,990 --> 01:00:30,210
This is your second mission of your
Rank Determination Race.

1051
01:00:30,650 --> 01:00:32,390
It's the Line of Rank mission.

1052
01:00:32,390 --> 01:00:33,530
What does it entail?

1053
01:00:33,530 --> 01:00:35,510
Dong Wan is going to kick
the ball in his hand.

1054
01:00:36,010 --> 01:00:42,230
You have to pick up the ball that he kicks,
and the person to get to the flag first wins.

1055
01:00:42,230 --> 01:00:45,050
You have to pull the flag out of the ground
in order for you to pass.

1056
01:00:45,050 --> 01:00:47,670
The winner will be determined
in the order of your arrival.

1057
01:00:47,670 --> 01:00:51,190
The first person to arrive and get the flag
will take over the first place.

1058
01:00:51,190 --> 01:00:54,200
Do you see the chaise lounge and
the parasol that is set up over there?

1059
01:00:54,200 --> 01:00:57,370
That's where the first place winner gets to
rest until the race is over.

1060
01:00:58,380 --> 01:01:00,430
- This is really...
- Wow.

1061
01:01:00,430 --> 01:01:02,610
I have to place within the top three
spots to make my life a little bit easier.

1062
01:01:02,610 --> 01:01:05,700
I really want to come in within
the first three spots.

1063
01:01:05,700 --> 01:01:07,960
People who haven't been in that car
don't even have the right to say anything.

1064
01:01:07,960 --> 01:01:09,630
Is it fourth through seventh place
that has to ride around in that car?

1065
01:01:09,640 --> 01:01:11,360
- Yes, of course.
- Let's win this!

1066
01:01:12,520 --> 01:01:16,050
[Determined to do whatever it takes
in order to avoid getting back in the car.]

1067
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:17,780
Ready!

1068
01:01:17,780 --> 01:01:19,090
[First round of second mission.]

1069
01:01:19,090 --> 01:01:20,600
Set, go!

1070
01:01:22,060 --> 01:01:23,090
Set, go!

1071
01:01:25,330 --> 01:01:26,620
[The first place winner...]

1072
01:01:26,620 --> 01:01:28,160
[is going to be me!]

1073
01:01:32,170 --> 01:01:34,870
[Mr. Capable is first to get to the ball.]

1074
01:01:34,870 --> 01:01:37,030
[And everyone crowds around him.]

1075
01:01:39,410 --> 01:01:42,200
[He breaks through that mob
and gets up on his feet?]

1076
01:01:42,890 --> 01:01:45,260
[Yoo Hyuk is knocked down with
one swipe of his hand!]

1077
01:01:48,220 --> 01:01:49,790
[Break free!]

1078
01:01:51,430 --> 01:01:53,820
[Faking from left to right
just like a rugby match!]

1079
01:01:58,980 --> 01:02:01,400
[Huh? Where is he going?]

1080
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:03,970
[Rule: Must pull out the flag!]

1081
01:02:05,850 --> 01:02:09,430
[Mr. Capable's energy on full force!]

1082
01:02:09,980 --> 01:02:11,960
[If we don't stop him, then we'll lose!]

1083
01:02:12,700 --> 01:02:15,510
[Mr. Capable on full power!]

1084
01:02:19,330 --> 01:02:23,660
[Mr. Capable,
Running Man's tower of strength!]

1085
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:26,630
[A man who's strength can't be matched...]

1086
01:02:26,630 --> 01:02:31,480
[Will he be able to claim his throne
as first place on Running Man team?]

1087
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:37,030
[He's unstoppable even with the
strength of all six members combined!]

1088
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:45,060
[He has the flag!]

1089

[Kim Jong Kook solidifies his position
in first place!]

1090

[The ball is all crumpled in his hand.]

1091
01:02:52,460 --> 01:02:53,930
Give me some water!

1092
01:02:55,260 --> 01:02:59,260
[Kwang-retriever switching over his
loyalty to the new king of the throne.]

1093
01:02:59,260 --> 01:03:00,600
Here, I'll get you some water.

1094
01:03:00,600 --> 01:03:02,040
Are you okay?

1095
01:03:02,800 --> 01:03:05,160
I knew it!
Jong Kook is the winner!

1096
01:03:06,980 --> 01:03:11,850
[Everyone bowing down in front of
the new wielder of power.]

1097
01:03:11,850 --> 01:03:13,380
Wow, you did so great.

[This is how Running Man members survive.]

1099
01:03:17,640 --> 01:03:18,670
That's good.

1100
01:03:18,670 --> 01:03:22,000
Kim Jong Kook came in first
during the first round of this mission.

1101

[There's still a chance to avoid
getting back in the steaming car!]

1102
01:03:25,590 --> 01:03:27,080
I can't get back in that car!

1103
01:03:27,080 --> 01:03:28,380
The first three spots.

1104
01:03:28,380 --> 01:03:31,920
Kim Jong Kook can now lie in his chaise
and rest in comfort.

1105
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:33,840
How am I supposed to rest in comfort
in this state?

1106
01:03:34,540 --> 01:03:36,710
[Looks like you're resting
comfortable enough.]

1107

- Why did you lose the ball?
- I can't believe you lost the ball.

1112
01:03:53,420 --> 01:03:56,350
[You guys lost the ball too!]

1113
01:03:57,290 --> 01:03:58,910
- Gary!
- Yes!

1114
01:03:58,910 --> 01:04:02,150
[Kkuk and Gary both moving up a spot
in their rank.]

1115

It's nice to meet you again like this.

1116
01:04:07,670 --> 01:04:09,870
There's even a fan over here.

1117
01:04:10,560 --> 01:04:12,970
There's even a fan and an umbrella
over here.

[Second place winner even gets an umbrella
to protect himself against the hot sun.]

1119

You two have no idea how good
you have it right now.

1120
01:04:19,590 --> 01:04:21,560
You two are so lucky not to have to
ride in that car.

1121
01:04:25,380 --> 01:04:28,220
[It's useless to give him nice things...]

1122
01:04:28,830 --> 01:04:30,360
This is like pure hell.

1123

bloodier than it ever has been!]

Everyone...

1128
01:04:54,380 --> 01:04:57,320
Why are you battling like your life
depends on it?

1129
01:04:57,320 --> 01:04:59,180
Have you forgotten who's in
first place right now?

1130
01:04:59,180 --> 01:05:03,010
- It's Mr. Kim Jong Kook!
- Who do you think will get swapped out?

1131
01:05:03,010 --> 01:05:05,450
- Of course.
- I understand.

1132
01:05:05,460 --> 01:05:06,740

[Are you happy?]

1136
01:05:18,360 --> 01:05:19,990

Kim Jong Kook is in first place.]

Lee Kwang Soo, are you not going to take
your place in the third place spot?

1139
01:05:28,110 --> 01:05:30,910
I'll go once I feed
my master some water first.

swap places around for lower level people.]

- I worked hard so that I could do this.

1142
01:05:37,260 --> 01:05:38,930
No, it's okay.

1143
01:05:40,210 --> 01:05:42,510

- No, I didn't!

[Kwang-retriever's desperate attempt
to stay alive in the race.]

1151

[Yoo Hyuk uses every ounce of
energy he has left in him!]

entertaining battle from all of you!

1154

too rough with a lady in the game?

- Do you have to go this far?
- I do have to go this far!

1161
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:06,430
You two are getting too touchy feely!

1162
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:10,000
- You're going too far!
- You two are getting too physical!

1163
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:11,810
I can't ride in that car anymore, Ji Hyo.

1164
01:07:12,390 --> 01:07:14,010
I can't ride in that car anymore.

1165
01:07:14,010 --> 01:07:15,870
Do something!

1166
01:07:15,870 --> 01:07:17,050
[What? Big-nose Brother takes it?]

1167
01:07:17,050 --> 01:07:18,650

[Picking up the flag pieces, and the ball...
and Blank Ji wins!]

1169
01:07:28,260 --> 01:07:30,020
Wow, that's a fierce battle.

1170
01:07:31,040 --> 01:07:33,760
This is the final battle.

1171
01:07:34,390 --> 01:07:36,290
- Everyone...
- Yes?

1172
01:07:36,290 --> 01:07:39,750
The person that comes in last
during this round...

1173
01:07:39,750 --> 01:07:44,570
we don't know yet whether he'll be in
last place or the third place yet.

1174
01:07:44,570 --> 01:07:46,110
- Yes, I understand.
- We'll work very hard!

1175
01:07:46,110 --> 01:07:50,240
- Yes, I understand!
- Don't think of it as your last chance.

1176
01:07:51,890 --> 01:07:55,770
[The final battle of this mission- Go!]

1177
01:07:58,040 --> 01:08:01,490
Even if you lose this battle,
you could be entitled to a bonus!

1178
01:08:01,490 --> 01:08:04,730
- Yes!
- It depends on how well you play the game.

1179

more entertaining for the viewers.]

[How is it that the two oldest
members of the team...]

1181
01:08:16,380 --> 01:08:18,770
No.
No, I can't get back in that car.

1182
01:08:19,380 --> 01:08:20,990
You're going to have to get back
in that car anyway.

1183

[The only way to avoid getting back in
that car is to earn that man's favor...]

1188
01:08:38,800 --> 01:08:41,150
[Does this look like an act?]

1189
01:08:41,150 --> 01:08:42,860
You're flailing your arm out towards
the flag! There you go!

1190
01:08:42,870 --> 01:08:44,280
Reach for the flag!
There you go!

to wield his power over ranking.]

1195

- Right here.
- Yes, I want to ride in that car.

1196
01:09:03,470 --> 01:09:04,750
Me!

1197
01:09:05,530 --> 01:09:07,470
- Please, Sir...
- I'd be grateful, Sir.

our fans really seem to love that.

1199
01:09:14,900 --> 01:09:18,040
I would like for Lee Kwang Soo and
Song Ji Hyo to swap out their spots.

1200
01:09:18,040 --> 01:09:20,850
[Third place Lee Kwang Soo to swap
with Fifth place, Song Ji Hyo.]

1201

- Thank you.
- Sure.

1202
01:09:22,270 --> 01:09:26,660
- Thank you.
- You're being so compliant and polite today.

1203
01:09:29,070 --> 01:09:31,460
- Come down here.
- Coming in at third place has no meaning.

1204
01:09:32,120 --> 01:09:35,080
- Coming in at third doesn't matter.
- Fine, let's do this.

I'm going to put my life on the line
to come in at top three.

1207
01:09:42,700 --> 01:09:47,220
- You already did that the last round.
- You're right. What does that even matter?

1208
01:09:47,410 --> 01:09:50,300
I really hate how this feels to have to
come back down after being at the top.

1209
01:09:50,300 --> 01:09:51,390
Yeah, it sucks.

1210
01:09:51,420 --> 01:09:53,800

- I can see the steam rising.

1215
01:10:04,370 --> 01:10:07,430
This isn't a car we're riding in.
It's basically a desert.

1216
01:10:07,430 --> 01:10:09,350
- I wore this long sleeved top on purpose.
- Why?

1217
01:10:09,350 --> 01:10:11,670
- Because the sun's burning my arm.
- I know.

1218

no matter what I had to do.

your own questions.

I come up with?

- In the early 70's...

- What kind of a question is that?
- This is my question.

1277
01:14:26,810 --> 01:14:30,490
- What year were you born in, Kwang Soo?
- I was born in '65.

1278
01:14:30,530 --> 01:14:32,730
You were born in '85, right?
I'll keep that in mind.

amongst the children back in the early 70s.

- Yes, we know.
- It was called, 'The Ghost Man'.

were the main characters of the show.]

With it being a horror cartoon theme,
this show traumatized many kids...

1284
01:14:56,220 --> 01:14:58,530
- Maybe that's not the right word.
- What do you mean, traumatized?

1285
01:14:58,530 --> 01:14:59,950
Were you traumatized by the show then?

1286
01:14:59,950 --> 01:15:03,220
What do you mean?
That cartoon didn't traumatize any kids.

1287
01:15:03,220 --> 01:15:09,090

three main characters from that show.

to this question, right?

come up with two out of the three names.

doesn't know the answer.]

- Yes.

- Did you think that they were scary looking?
- Yes, I just remembered what they look like.

the wrong answer?]

[Gary, Gil, Leessang.]

1317
01:16:39,720 --> 01:16:42,090
[Gary- wrong answer!]

1318
01:16:47,710 --> 01:16:49,670
[A ride on the banana boat for
getting the wrong answer!]

1319
01:16:56,730 --> 01:16:58,890
- I had no idea what the answer was.
- That was really hard.

1320
01:16:58,890 --> 01:17:00,820
[This is now Suk Jin's new seat.]

1321
01:17:00,820 --> 01:17:03,040
I knew the right answer.

1322
01:17:03,340 --> 01:17:04,830
Why did it have to be me!

1323
01:17:06,310 --> 01:17:07,980
Life can be changed in one
single moment!

1324
01:17:07,980 --> 01:17:11,630
[Second place, Gary is swapped out with
seventh place, Suk Jin.]

1325
01:17:12,380 --> 01:17:15,440
[Yoo Hyuk is currently seated
in the first place throne.]

1326
01:17:15,440 --> 01:17:17,520
- This question... is about nature.
- Wow... nature?

1327
01:17:17,780 --> 01:17:19,140
Giraffes are...

1328
01:17:19,910 --> 01:17:23,180
known for having the highest, what?

1329
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:27,140
What is the highest thing that they're known
to have because of their long necks?

1330
01:17:27,140 --> 01:17:30,200
- Giraffes has the highest, what?
- The highest thing that they're known for?

1331
01:17:30,200 --> 01:17:31,910
Isn't that too easy of a question?

1332
01:17:31,910 --> 01:17:34,590
[Giraffes are known for having the
highest 'what' because of their long necks?]

1333
01:17:34,850 --> 01:17:38,340
[The correct answer is... 'blood pressure'.]

1334
01:17:38,340 --> 01:17:42,500
[They're known to have the highest blood
pressure to get the blood up their long necks.]

1335
01:17:42,500 --> 01:17:43,790
It's high, you say?

1336
01:17:44,190 --> 01:17:45,980
How many letters in the answer?

1337
01:17:45,980 --> 01:17:47,510
Less than three.

1338
01:17:48,870 --> 01:17:51,050
- Yes!
- I know the right answer.

1339
01:17:51,050 --> 01:17:52,710
I know what the two letter answer is.

1340
01:17:52,710 --> 01:17:54,150
I got the right answer.

1341
01:17:54,160 --> 01:17:55,600
This must be it.

1342
01:17:55,960 --> 01:17:57,740
I feel bad for Kwang Soo.

1343
01:17:58,660 --> 01:17:59,760
I feel like everyone knows the answer.

1344
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:01,480
How many characters in those two letters?

1345
01:18:01,830 --> 01:18:03,350
The two letters both have
three characters.

1346
01:18:03,350 --> 01:18:05,550
[Hm...]

1347
01:18:07,520 --> 01:18:09,490
- I already know the answer to this.
- Suk Jin.

1348
01:18:09,490 --> 01:18:11,900
- Yes.
- In those two letters...

1349
01:18:12,440 --> 01:18:14,170
is 'P' a part of the character used or not?

1350
01:18:14,170 --> 01:18:15,590
No, it's not used.

1351
01:18:16,170 --> 01:18:17,910
[Uh oh...]

1352
01:18:17,910 --> 01:18:19,780
What about 'S'?

1353
01:18:19,780 --> 01:18:21,850
- It's used.
- Come out here, Song Ji Hyo!

1354
01:18:27,260 --> 01:18:29,470
Lee Kwang Soo,
please reveal your answer.

1355
01:18:29,480 --> 01:18:34,440
[Lee Kwang Soo's correct answer-
Blood pressure.]

1356
01:18:34,440 --> 01:18:36,450
Song Ji Hyo, your answer?

1357
01:18:36,450 --> 01:18:42,420
[What did Ji Hyo come up with
as her answer?]

1358
01:18:43,810 --> 01:18:46,650
[Blood pressure- Correct!]

1359
01:18:47,220 --> 01:18:48,790
What?
Me?

1360
01:18:53,590 --> 01:18:56,130
[Challenger Kwang Soo is off
on his boat ride!]

1361
01:18:56,960 --> 01:18:59,950
[Ace Ji Hyo having pretended not to
know the answer even when she knew!]

1362
01:19:02,970 --> 01:19:05,600
[A forceful plunge into the water!]

1363
01:19:06,220 --> 01:19:08,730
- Ji Hyo knew the answer!
- Ji Hyo knew!

1364
01:19:08,730 --> 01:19:11,630
- I didn't think Ji Hyo knew.
- Ji Hyo was faking!

1365
01:19:11,630 --> 01:19:13,270
Yeah, she faked it.

1366
01:19:13,270 --> 01:19:17,080
[Time to tally up all the gold coins
that they've gained so far.]

1367
01:19:17,080 --> 01:19:18,320
I have 11.

1368
01:19:18,320 --> 01:19:20,030
- Why does Gary have so many?
- Gary has a lot.

1369
01:19:20,030 --> 01:19:21,950
- I have 14.
- Wow!

1370
01:19:22,350 --> 01:19:24,180
- I have nine.
- Nine.

1371
01:19:24,180 --> 01:19:25,690
I have 14.

1372
01:19:25,690 --> 01:19:27,250
I have 14, too.

1373
01:19:27,250 --> 01:19:28,780
I have eight.

1374
01:19:29,160 --> 01:19:32,310
- How does he have eight?
- How did you get that many?

1375
01:19:32,310 --> 01:19:33,610
[His count sounds a little fishy...]

1376
01:19:33,610 --> 01:19:36,600
We will now determine the final
ranking of your positions.

1377
01:19:36,600 --> 01:19:39,200
[Using the number of coins to determine
the final ranking of their positions.]

1378
01:19:39,200 --> 01:19:41,240
The four of you with the 14 coins,
please step over to the side.

1379
01:19:41,240 --> 01:19:43,460
[A total of four people with 14 coins!]

1380
01:19:43,460 --> 01:19:47,760
[The four people who've worked hard all day
are feeling excited about their standing!]

1381
01:19:47,760 --> 01:19:49,440
Am I still in last place even with
these two that I stole away?

1382
01:19:50,940 --> 01:19:54,000
In the order of your win from the last round,
Song Ji Hyo is in the top spot.

1383
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:55,730
Then am I in second place?

1384
01:19:55,730 --> 01:19:59,630
Then Kang Gary, Ha Ha, and
Kim Jong Kook.

1385
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:06,160
[Ji Hyo, Gary, Ha Ha, Jong Kook,
Jae Suk, Suk Jin, and Kwang Soo.]

1386
01:20:06,170 --> 01:20:08,980
- What the heck!
- I can't believe I'm in first place.

1387
01:20:08,980 --> 01:20:11,510
- Give me your third place badge.
- You never know what could happen in life.

1388
01:20:12,820 --> 01:20:13,920
What the heck is this?

1389
01:20:13,920 --> 01:20:15,580
- Then I'm in fifth place?
- Who gets my fourth place badge?

1390
01:20:15,580 --> 01:20:18,210
So if I hadn't taken this from Gary's bag,
he would've come in at first place?

1391
01:20:18,210 --> 01:20:20,080
What?
You stole my coins?

1392
01:20:21,410 --> 01:20:25,100
[Traitorous Giraffe having stolen two coins
from Gary's bag when he wasn't looking.]

1393
01:20:25,100 --> 01:20:27,430
We were told to keep it safe,
but Gary left his bag next to me.

1394
01:20:27,430 --> 01:20:31,580
Starting with the first place winner...
Do you see the treasure ship behind you?

1395
01:20:33,630 --> 01:20:35,990
[Treasure ship?]

1396
01:20:35,990 --> 01:20:37,930
Look!
It's a pirate ship!

1397
01:20:38,280 --> 01:20:40,230
Wow, that is a pirate ship!

1398
01:20:40,230 --> 01:20:43,260
[Something... is coming
into their view on the water!]

1399
01:20:45,340 --> 01:20:50,090
[A black ship gliding towards them
on top of the water...]

1400
01:20:53,250 --> 01:20:58,380
[Just what is the identity of this ship
that appeared suddenly out of nowhere?]

1401
01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:01,360
- What is that?
- Is that really a pirate ship?

1402
01:21:02,070 --> 01:21:04,050
- That's our ship.
- Really?

1403
01:21:04,050 --> 01:21:05,320
The Black Pearl?

1404
01:21:05,320 --> 01:21:07,080
- Oh my goodness.
- That's your ship?

1405
01:21:09,080 --> 01:21:14,240
[The mysterious black ship...
What is the secret that it carries?]

1406
01:21:17,990 --> 01:21:20,610
[Starting with first place winner...]

1407
01:21:20,610 --> 01:21:24,880
[Everyone will have a chance to board the
ship and increase the amount of their gold!]

1408
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:27,120
- Wow, what is this?
- This is so cool.

1409
01:21:27,130 --> 01:21:30,080
- Then can we lose it too?
- You'll find out once you're on-board.

1410
01:21:30,560 --> 01:21:32,990
- Then I'll go first.
- We have to go on-board to find out?

1411
01:21:32,990 --> 01:21:34,230
Good luck, Miss Blank.

1412
01:21:34,230 --> 01:21:35,830
[Ji Hyo is the first to head off
towards the black ship.]

1413
01:21:35,830 --> 01:21:37,120
Okay, good luck.

1414
01:21:37,560 --> 01:21:41,610
[Just what awaits them on that boat?]

1415
01:21:45,370 --> 01:21:47,350
You don't think that they'll kidnap
Ji Hyo, do you?

1416
01:21:47,920 --> 01:21:49,590
[Nervous...]

1417
01:21:51,730 --> 01:21:56,230
[Ji Hyo is getting closer and closer
towards the black ship...]

1418
01:21:56,230 --> 01:21:58,030
Wow!

1419
01:22:11,860 --> 01:22:13,200
It's so dark in here.

1420
01:22:14,810 --> 01:22:16,190
What is this?

1421
01:22:17,540 --> 01:22:20,360
- Second place holder may get going.
- Okay.

1422
01:22:29,250 --> 01:22:31,580
Wait... you're pirates!

1423
01:22:31,580 --> 01:22:33,230
Why are you doing this to me?

1424
01:22:34,380 --> 01:22:37,000
[Taking the pouch full of her gold
away from her!]

1425
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:38,220
That's my gold!

1426
01:22:43,960 --> 01:22:46,330
I worked so hard to earn that gold!

1427
01:22:48,240 --> 01:22:52,510
All of the other members are heading
here without knowing what awaits them...

1428
01:22:53,500 --> 01:22:55,120
Why is it so dark in here?
What's going on in here?

1429
01:22:55,120 --> 01:22:56,380
What is this?

1430
01:22:57,590 --> 01:22:58,860
What the heck?

1431
01:23:05,490 --> 01:23:06,740
That's my gold!

1432
01:23:06,740 --> 01:23:09,820
[Gary has his 14 pieces of gold
taken away from him as well.]

1433
01:23:14,050 --> 01:23:15,500
What is this?

1434
01:23:16,250 --> 01:23:18,760
I don't know either.
They took my gold away from me too.

1435
01:23:19,990 --> 01:23:22,800
[Everyone who boards the ship is
taken hostage by the pirates!]

1436
01:23:22,800 --> 01:23:25,350
I thought we were going to get the
chance to earn more gold!

1437
01:23:37,490 --> 01:23:41,020
[The pirates are taking all their gold away!]

1438
01:23:41,610 --> 01:23:43,400
This is a pirate ship.

1439
01:23:52,390 --> 01:23:53,680
No!

1440
01:23:54,020 --> 01:23:56,870
[That's what you think.]

1441
01:23:58,570 --> 01:24:01,920
[All of Running Man's gold is
taken away from them!]

1442
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:03,010
What is this?

1443
01:24:03,010 --> 01:24:05,860
- What's going on? Where are we going?
- What's happening to us?

1444
01:24:06,600 --> 01:24:09,290
[The ship... is moving?]

1445
01:24:09,670 --> 01:24:12,010
Please!
Please let us go!

1446
01:24:19,720 --> 01:24:22,980
[The next morning...]

1447
01:24:24,260 --> 01:24:29,120
[The mysterious pirate ship
full of their stolen gold.]

1448
01:24:33,770 --> 01:24:39,260
[The occupants of that boat have
been on that boat the whole time...]

1449

[The pirate ship sailing the ocean
once again in search for more gold.]

1450

[The hostages being taken against their will
after having their gold taken from them.]

1451
01:24:59,360 --> 01:25:00,710
We don't have any money.

1452
01:25:00,710 --> 01:25:03,350
You've already taken
all of our money away from us.

1453
01:25:03,890 --> 01:25:08,450
[It's time to meet the owner of this ship.]

1454
01:25:08,870 --> 01:25:10,880
- Get up there.
- We have no money.

1455
01:25:12,920 --> 01:25:15,010
Let the first three...
I mean first place spots live.

1456
01:25:17,300 --> 01:25:20,150
[Welcome, Running Man!]

1457

[The owners of this ship-
Top Idol Group in Korea, Shinhwa!]

Hurry up and get up here!

1466
01:25:53,100 --> 01:25:55,430
- Are you seriously going to be like this?
- What are you guys doing?

1467
01:25:55,430 --> 01:25:57,600
[A scary atmosphere?]

1468

Wow!
It's Shinhwa!

1469

Hello!

1470
01:26:02,870 --> 01:26:04,300
We're pirates!

1471
01:26:04,300 --> 01:26:06,220
No, you're Shinhwa.
What are you talking about?

1472
01:26:07,110 --> 01:26:09,490
We are... pirates!

1473
01:26:10,710 --> 01:26:12,890
[Look at these guys...]

1474
01:26:14,190 --> 01:26:16,200
Don't you recognize me, Eric?

1475
01:26:16,630 --> 01:26:19,090
We are... pirates!

1476
01:26:19,090 --> 01:26:21,340
- Look at these guys.
- Where's the other guy?

1477
01:26:21,340 --> 01:26:23,200
Where's Dong Wan?

1478
01:26:23,200 --> 01:26:25,710
We dunked him in the ocean.

1479
01:26:27,760 --> 01:26:30,530
[It's a good thing that they're
nice pirates.]

1480
01:26:32,220 --> 01:26:34,350
Why did you take our gold away from us?

1481
01:26:34,350 --> 01:26:37,060
- Your gold is now in our possession.
- Where did you guys put it?

1482
01:26:39,060 --> 01:26:40,250
Right here.

1483
01:26:41,480 --> 01:26:42,830
- You want me to open it for you?
- Why can't you open it?

1484
01:26:43,980 --> 01:26:46,360
[For a pirate, his strength is a bit...]

1485
01:26:46,360 --> 01:26:48,360
- Can you open this for me?
- Say 'please'.

1486
01:26:48,360 --> 01:26:50,810
What kind of a pirate are you?

1487
01:26:54,310 --> 01:26:56,260
[What?]

1488
01:26:57,360 --> 01:27:00,980
[What happened to yesterday's gold?]

1489
01:27:07,780 --> 01:27:13,880
[The curse in the movie,
'Pirates of the Caribbean'...]

1490
01:27:19,030 --> 01:27:22,930
[All their gold has turned into scrap metal!]

1491
01:27:27,910 --> 01:27:29,410
There was gold in there last night.

1492
01:27:31,770 --> 01:27:33,970
[A letter inside the chest?]

1493
01:27:33,970 --> 01:27:35,220
There's a letter.

1494
01:27:35,580 --> 01:27:37,130
[There you go.]

1495
01:27:37,130 --> 01:27:40,160
- Give it to Ji Hyo to read.
- You shouldn't have given that to them.

1496
01:27:40,160 --> 01:27:42,390
We have to stay in charge here.

1497
01:27:44,860 --> 01:27:46,900
The curse of the tides.

1498
01:27:46,900 --> 01:27:49,770
- Is it the tidal shores again?
- The curse of the tides?

1499
01:27:49,770 --> 01:27:51,990
<i>Your treasure has been cursed.</i>

1500
01:27:51,990 --> 01:27:55,070
<i>Through a series of competitions,
you will be given hints to lift the curse.</i>

1501
01:27:56,030 --> 01:28:00,720
<i>The winning team will be given a useful clue,
and the losing team, an ambiguous one.</i>

1502
01:28:01,060 --> 01:28:06,100
<i>The first team to gather up all the hints to
lift the curse will take all of the treasure.</i>

1503
01:28:06,480 --> 01:28:07,760
No!

1504
01:28:07,760 --> 01:28:09,100
That enough.
Give it a rest.

1505
01:28:11,500 --> 01:28:14,000
- We have to find our treasure.
- What is the matter with you?

1506
01:28:14,220 --> 01:28:17,670
So we have to compete against each other
to take over the treasure?

1507
01:28:17,670 --> 01:28:20,420
But there are only five members on
the Shinhwa Team, so what do we do?

1508
01:28:20,430 --> 01:28:22,610
- I know.
- Then I'll join this team.

1509
01:28:23,620 --> 01:28:25,950
- I think five of them would be plenty.
- Why are you saying that?

1510
01:28:25,950 --> 01:28:28,890
That is true though.
The way I see it, these guys...

1511
01:28:28,890 --> 01:28:32,370
- These guys are really competitive.
- We love competition.

1512
01:28:32,370 --> 01:28:35,140
Seriously though,
it's not just that they're competitive

1513
01:28:35,140 --> 01:28:39,220
but even when we they did that bungee jump,
they were all so fearless about it.

1514
01:28:39,220 --> 01:28:41,430
[Fierce competitors who know
no fear when it comes to competing.]

1515
01:28:41,430 --> 01:28:45,410
- Hye Sung and Andy over here...
- He's like a superman.

1516
01:28:45,410 --> 01:28:47,310
Andy's super athletic.

1517
01:28:47,310 --> 01:28:51,670
- They're all too good.
- I normally wouldn't say this...

1518
01:28:51,670 --> 01:28:53,680
but these guys are just fine
to compete against the seven of us.

1519
01:28:53,690 --> 01:28:56,830
If anything, it's better that Dong Wan
isn't with you guys today.

1520
01:28:56,830 --> 01:28:58,450
He's like a sink hole amongst us.

1521
01:28:58,450 --> 01:29:00,370
Isn't he really strong though?

1522
01:29:01,570 --> 01:29:03,350
Let's just do the race the way
we're grouped right now?

1523
01:29:03,350 --> 01:29:05,150
- No, I don't know.
- Can we do that?

1524
01:29:05,150 --> 01:29:07,350
I think this setup is just fine if
we're going to compete with Shinhwa.

1525
01:29:07,360 --> 01:29:09,900
I can smell the blood in the air today.

1526
01:29:11,920 --> 01:29:14,140
But Eric really suits his character today.

1527
01:29:14,140 --> 01:29:17,670
[Eric looks as though he can be included
in the cast of a pirate movie.]

1528
01:29:17,670 --> 01:29:19,570
- You can be in a pirate movie.
- Yeah, you look like you'd fit perfectly.

1529
01:29:19,570 --> 01:29:21,240
You look really handsome.

1530
01:29:22,880 --> 01:29:24,980
- He's always been good looking.
- He's always been handsome.

1531
01:29:24,980 --> 01:29:26,860
But he wasn't this good looking in the past.

1532
01:29:29,240 --> 01:29:31,770
He looks like he's gotten even
better looking.

1533
01:29:36,440 --> 01:29:38,070
Okay, we lost.

1534
01:29:39,130 --> 01:29:43,890
[Off they go to lift
the curse off of their treasure!]

1535
01:29:46,760 --> 01:29:47,980
There it is!

1536
01:29:48,830 --> 01:29:54,000
[Appearing in front of their eyes...]

1537
01:29:54,010 --> 01:29:58,200
[is a scene of wild, natural beauty!]

1538
01:30:00,110 --> 01:30:03,970
[A grassy sandbank in the middle of the ocean
acting as the ocean's own desert!]

1539
01:30:05,150 --> 01:30:14,650
[Mystical sandy island that shows
the grandeur and beauty twice a day!]

1540
01:30:15,510 --> 01:30:18,500
[Running Man and Shinhwa touches shore.]

1541
01:30:18,500 --> 01:30:20,430
- This is like a work of art.
- I can't believe a place like this exists.

1542
01:30:20,430 --> 01:30:22,400
So this is underwater part of the day?

1543
01:30:24,800 --> 01:30:26,700
You didn't make this island
just for the show, did you?

1544
01:30:28,710 --> 01:30:33,240
[The first leg of their journey to lift
the curse off of their treasure!]

1545
01:30:34,970 --> 01:30:41,390
[Just who will get their hands
on the real treasure?]

1546
