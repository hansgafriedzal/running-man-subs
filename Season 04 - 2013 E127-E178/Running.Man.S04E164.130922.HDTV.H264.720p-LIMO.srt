[Chuseok Special- The Mighty Inheritance]

00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:09,790
[One crisp fall morning...]

3
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:16,320
[Madame Go's family members are
called in for an emergency family meeting.]

4
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:19,630
Oh!

5
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:23,650
I'm here as your corporate family lawyer.

6
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:26,030
I used to be a prosecutor.

7
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:29,530
[Firstborn grandson of the
younger daughter- Ha Ha.]

8
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:32,110
This...

9
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:34,130
I remember this!

10
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,270
- When we were given our inheritance...
- Yes, that's correct.

11
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:42,700
Okay, I got it.
Today, I'm going to make sure to...

12
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:45,280
I'm going to see this through to the end.

13
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,800
[Just then, another person competing
for the inheritance makes his entrance.]

14

[Second born son of the older daughter-

15
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:54,420
I'm glad that I'm not in the same family
as that loser over there.

16
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:56,600
[Exchanging friendly words of greeting.]

17
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:00,740
[Instead of greetings of cheer on this holiday,
it's greetings of insults.]

18
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:02,440
- What did you say?
- Hello, everyone.

19
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:04,940

- The enemy of my parents!

27
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:32,160
Your parents are still alive.

28
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:36,110
Listen to him. He doesn't even know
his parents are still alive.

29
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:39,740

He is the firstborn son of the
older daughter's family.

36
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,710
[Sensing that he's the older brother?
Firstborn son- Suk Jin.]

37
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:58,660
He's the oldest grandson.

38
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:02,770
Welcome. He's the younger son-in-law
of the younger daughter's family.

- How is Gary the dad?
- Then who is this supposed to be?

45
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:21,920
[Then the empty seat would be...
Suk Jin, Jae Suk, and Jong Kook's mom?]

46
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,020
If she's supposed to be Suk Jin's mom...

47
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:28,450

he was breastfed out of nowhere.]

So who's the youngest in our family?
I see that his seat is still left empty.

55
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,750
The youngest grandson is about
to make his entrance.

56

00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:35,220
You're the youngest grandson?

65

[First time meeting between the mommy
and her youngest son.]

73

How can you even say that?
He's my son!

Get it?

will now make her entrance.

83

[The nation's beloved mother,

92
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:09,370
Welcome.

93
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:13,150
- That's a real mom!
- Welcome. She's the older daughter.

94
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:15,030
Why are you calling out for your mom?

95
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:17,530
- Mom!
- Why do you keep calling for me?

96
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:19,670
[Their mom's force making them bow
their heads down in automatic response.]

97
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:21,860
- Mom!
- I can't believe that it's her.

98
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:25,360
- It's a real mom. She really is our mom.
- She's your real mom?

99
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:32,140
[The three brothers' charismatic mom,
Kim Hae Sook.]

100
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:35,550
- So would she be my sister-in-law?
- Yes, she's your sister-in-law.

101
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:38,540
Sister-in-law!
Have you been well, sister-in-law?

102
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:40,590
Yes, I've been very well.

103
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:44,940
So what's going on here is that
Madame Go Dong Wan is our grandmother.

104
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:49,940
- Our grandmother had two daughters.
- We're your three sons.

105
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:52,650
- Over there is our first cousins.
- That's your younger sister's family.

106
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,370
Why haven't you greeted me yet?

107
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:58,310
Just hurry up and pay back
the money that you owe my family!

108
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,720
- What did you say?
- All you do is borrow money from us!

109
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,150
What did you say!

110
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,710
What did you say!
Pay back the money?

111
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:09,780
[His aunt's force is overflowing.]

112
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:13,990
<i>Anyway, I will now explain the reason
why I have asked all the family members</i>

113
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,860
<i>to gather here again today for
another family meeting.</i>

114
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:21,470
<i>Madame Go Dong Wan really wanted to be
here to read her will and testaments herself</i>

115
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:23,990
<i>but she had a meeting at
the White House to attend</i>

116
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:26,220
<i>and she also had an urgent
M & A meeting to attend...</i>

117
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:28,550
- Don't act like you know what you're saying.
- and thus, she wasn't able to attend today.

118
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:33,230
Therefore, acting on her behalf as the
family attorney, I will read it out for you.

119
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:36,110
<i>My beloved children,
listen very carefully.</i>

120
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,480
<i>My beloved children...
Listen very carefully.</i>

121
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:45,250
<i>There's not many years left to live
for this mother of yours.</i>

122
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:50,710
<i>All this land and the countless numbers
of buildings that you see behind you...</i>

123
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:56,250
<i>You are aware that this is all
a part of my vast fortune, don't you?</i>

124
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:57,890
[All this land and the buildings?]

125
00:06:57,890 --> 00:06:59,090
I love you, mother!

126
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:01,110
- She's your grandmother.
- I mean, grandmother!

127
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:02,450
She's your grandmother.

128
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:07,350
<i>It seems as though the time has come for me
to pass my entire fortune down to you.</i>

129
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:10,790
<i>As you all know already,
I've lost all my appetite lately</i>

130
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,350
<i>and it's really added on to
my lack of energy.</i>

131
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:14,290
What a joke.
You're totally fat.

132
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:16,820
<i>Mom!</i>

133
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,300
<i>You will have to pass
a series of hurdles today...</i>

134
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:24,540
<i>and make your way to the
final location.</i>

135
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:30,160
<i>And to the daughter and her family
who makes the ultimate dish...</i>

136
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,620
[The ultimate dish?]

137
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:35,700
<i>My unbelievably vast fortune will be passed
down to that daughter and her family.</i>

138
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:38,610
<i>Thus, I hope that you all put in
your best efforts today</i>

139
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:43,160
<i>in order to create the ultimate dish so that
you may be the one to inherit the fortune.</i>

140
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:45,890
[Feeling confident?]

141
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:48,040
- The fortune will be ours.
- We're all set.

142
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:51,400
You have to win each mission

143
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:55,640
in order to win the items that will be
very useful to you at the final location.

144
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:58,220
So I hope that each of you will
do your best to win these missions.

145
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:02,960
Lastly, Madame Go Dong Wan has personally
written letters for each of the teams.

146
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:06,990
She has asked me to hand them to you, and
I will give one to the older daughter first.

147
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:09,490
<i>To my beloved daughters.</i>

148
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:12,040
<i>Find your way to the swimming pool
in the woods...</i>

149
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,580
The summer special episode
ended last week.

150
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:20,460
- Why are we going to the pool again?
- Why do we have to go to the swimming pool?

151
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:23,620
There's nothing we won't do if it means
we'll win our inheritance.

152
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:27,480
[Mommy Hae Sook scolding her sons and telling
them to think about winning the fortune.]

153
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:30,010
She needs to experience being in the
pool before she realizes what it's like.

154
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:33,950
She doesn't know what it's like right now and
that's why she's just focused on the fortune.

155
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:37,670
You're telling us that we have to go in the
water in this weather we're having right now?

156
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:43,570
What is there that we can't do right now if
it means we'll get our hands on the fortune?

157
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:45,920
Look at how I'm even
wearing my glasses right now.

158
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,000
I'm going to do everything I can today
to get my hands on that inheritance.

159
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:51,840
- I can see the swimming pool over there.
- I can see something.

160
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,500
[A swimming pool is slowly coming into
their vision from afar...]

161
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,810
- It's a flying chair.
- It's a flying chair? No way!

162
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:58,940
- It's a flying chair.
- Mom, can you go flying off that chair?

163
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:03,960
[What do you think of this resort?
It'll go to the winning family...]

164
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,530
- This resort belongs to our grandmother.
- It belongs to our grandmother?

165
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:08,110
<i>[I've prepared a game most families like to
play when they gather together for Chuseok.]</i>

166
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:09,720
Who plays games like this on Chuseok?

167
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:12,430
<i>[If my daughters chooses the wrong card,
their sons will get dunked in the water.]</i>

168
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:15,970
It means if you pick the 'Ddong-kwang' card,
we'll go flying into the water.

169
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:17,760
- Then moms aren't getting dunked?
- 'Ddong-kwang' card.

170
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:22,060
- Don't you think mom should experience it?
- How can you want that for our mother?

171
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:23,410
- Be quiet!
- Yes, Mom.

172
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:26,550
After all the years that I've breastfed you!

173
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:30,010
[Feeling betrayed by her youngest son whom
she breastfed to help him gain his muscles.]

174
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:31,470
- How could you want me in that water?
- Mom.

175
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:33,570
You're relieved now that you
know you won't be in that chair, right?

176
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:34,680
Yeah, I feel so much happier.

177
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,740
Mom, you have to pick the right card.

178
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:38,860
- How do we get over there?
- We have to walk.

179
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:41,310
We have to walk into the water?
Seriously?

180
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:43,680
Did you think that you could fly there?

181
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:50,140
[The chill of the fall air that can be felt
down to their bones.]

182
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:55,130
[The harshness of the variety world that
Ah In is feeling for the first time.]

183
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:59,010
[The eldest son having borrowed his mom's
float to get over to the chairs.]

184
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:10,820
[Automatically clenching his fists as soon as
his body experiences the chill of the water.]

185
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:14,210
This isn't the right time of the year to be
in the water right now.

186
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:20,020
<i>There are five cards under the blankets that
are placed in front of the two mothers.</i>

187
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:24,690
[Iconic cultural game, 'Hwatu',
is placed in front of the mothers.]

188
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:26,390
<i>As you can see, one of them is
the 'Ddong-kwang' card.</i>

189
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:28,720
<i>The two mothers will take turns to
choose a card.</i>

190
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:32,700
<i>And if you pick that card, the male members
of that team will get flown off their chairs.</i>

191
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:34,740
<i>A total of five games will be played,
three wins out of five draw</i>

192
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:36,350
<i>will complete a round of the game.</i>

193
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:41,240
<i>And the first team to win the first
three points will win the whole game.</i>

194
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:43,880
- Do you all understand?
- You just have to win 15 rounds, Mom.

195
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,410
You just need to win 15 rounds, okay?

196
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:49,070
[It's pretty simple, huh?]

197
00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:52,420
Have you seen my mom in the movie,
'The Naked City'?

198
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:55,320
- She's very quick with her hands.
- She does have very fast hands.

199
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:58,840
Don't forget that I used to
chew on razor blades.

200
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:04,740
[Having shown how charismatic she can be
in her role as the infamous purse snatcher.]

201
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,030
I used to chew on razor blades,
so don't mess with me.

202
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:11,070
- Remember her role with Im Dal Hwa?
- She was a thief in that movie too.

203
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:13,420
- She had dome romance in that movie.
- Then is Dal Hwa our dad?

204
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,700
- Dal Hwa's our dad?
- Dal Hwa is our dad.

205
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:18,250
I didn't know that Dal Hwa was our dad.

206
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:21,940
Notice how you all look very different?
That's because you all have different dads.

207
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,460
[Mom's explosive confession.]

208
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:25,870
What are you saying right now?

209
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:30,000
Our mother...
our mother was a very big romantic.

210
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,270
<i>The two mothers will determine who goes first
by playing a round of rock-paper-scissors.</i>

211
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:35,760
Rock-paper-scissors!

212
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:39,100
- Okay, Song Ji Hyo wins.
- How could you do this to me?

213
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,010
You!

214
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:43,160
Song Ji Hyo will pick the first card.

215
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,450
- But this is really...
- I'm getting really nervous back here.

216
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:52,840
<i>'Ddong-kwang'!
'Ddong-kwang'!</i>

217
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:57,260
[Draws 'Bi-Kwang'- Pass!]

218
00:11:57,260 --> 00:12:00,710
- This is really nerve-wrecking.
- I'm getting really nervous.

219
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:02,990
- I'm getting nervous.
- Draw 'Ddong-kwang' card!

220
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:06,060
- Mom, be careful.
- This is driving me crazy!

221
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:09,650
You're going to make us this nervous
first thing in the morning?

222
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:13,830
[Being made to feel extremely agitated on an
empty stomach first thing in the morning.]

223
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:15,640
It hasn't even been an hour
since I woke up this morning!

224
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:18,080
Little brother!
This is what you call a variety show!

225
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,690
Mom, draw your card.

226
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:23,970
Mom!

227
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:29,390
['Pal-kwang'- Pass.]

228
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:31,070
Oh, Pal-kwang!

229
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:35,010
Mom!

230
00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:36,660
This is making me so nervous.

231
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:39,960
[Only three cards left to choose from.]

232
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:43,100
[Their stomachs hurting even more to be
so nervous on an empty stomach.]

233
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,960
My stomach is rumbling.

234
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:48,770
I can't even tell you how nervous
I am right now.

235
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:50,370
The middle one looks good.

236
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,170
'Ddong-kwang'!

237
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:56,750
[Choosing the middle card, as
instructed by her husband, Gary.]

238
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:01,640
[Wow... pass!]

239
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:10,740
- Have a very nice trip.
- You have to pick the right one!

240
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:12,770
- This one!
- Pick the one right in front of you!

241
00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:16,040
- This is seriously driving me crazy.
- Pick it up together on the count of three.

242
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:18,710
[One of the two families will get
flown into the air.]

243
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:24,150
[Just which of the two will draw
the 'Ddong-kwang' card?]

244
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:36,570
[Where...]

245
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:39,030
[am I going?]

246
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:47,120
[Just shaved ten years off their lives.]

247
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,750
Mom!

248
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:52,310
[Hae Sook's family is in a celebratory mood.]

249
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:01,590
[Automatically breaking out in a dance.]

250
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:04,990
Our mom is best!

251
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:07,290
Ah In. How do you
feel now that you've seen it?

252
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:08,980
I want to be in the chair.

253
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,770
He has to get dunked in that water
for him to come to his senses.

254
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:17,860
[I guess he's not afraid of it yet...]

255
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:19,250
Please mix up the cards again.

256
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:23,350
Mom, I want to go back home in
my nice and dry clothes.

257
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:25,470
In nice and dry clothes.

258
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:29,290
[Acting like a child to his mom because
he doesn't want to play in the water.]

259
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:31,200
- You're my junior, aren't you?
- Yes.

260
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,500
Then you know what to do.

261
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:35,030
[Thinly veiled threats.]

262
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:39,760
[A reassuring mom to have in your corner.]

263
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,960
- Our mom is the best.
- Her style is very similar to Jong Kook's.

264
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:45,160
[That is my mom after all.]

265
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,630
- Let's go. Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

266
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:48,940
That's right.

267
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:52,040
[Did Ji Hyo heed Hae Sook's threats?]

268
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:54,250
You're one smart cookie.

269
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,190
[Hae Sook passes.]

270
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:02,690
- That's our mom.
- That is our mom.

271
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:05,680
[Ji Hyo's family feeling anxious.]

272
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,510
- It'll be 'Ddong-kwang' right away.
- 'Ddong-kwang' card!

273
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,310
[Blank Ji also passes.]

274
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:15,330
[Sitting on pins and needles.]

275
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:16,890
I'm going crazy sitting here.

276
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:19,350
It's nerve-wrecking for us too
since we can't see anything either.

277
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:21,080
One, two, three.

278
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:25,460
[Passes again!]

279
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:29,610
[The magical touch of their mother's hand.]

280
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:32,950
Aunt!

281
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:35,210
You used to be a gambler, weren't you?

282
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:40,580
- Song Ji Hyo will now make her draw.
- Pick the card in front of you.

283
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:42,160
No, one to the left!

284
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:46,510
- I'm going to listen to my youngest son.
- She's not going to listen to her husband.

285
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:49,830
I listened to my husband earlier,
so it's my son's turn now.

286
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:52,240
Please help us go home in our dry clothes!

287
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,810
[Who will it be this time?]

288
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:12,500
[Again!]

289
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,550
[Our mom is the best!]

290
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:20,820
- What did I tell you?
- This family has no luck!

291
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:24,400
You keep listening to the kids,
and you'll ruin our family!

292
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:28,770
- Our mom's the best.
- Mom!

293
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:32,130
- Mom! Listen to what dad tells you!
- Let's just all die together!

294
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:35,030
I'm so sorry!

295
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:37,180
Mom, mom, mom!

296
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:39,110
We may be able to go home in
our dry clothes after all!

297
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:43,460
The resort will be ours!
It'll be ours!

298
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:46,650
It's ours!
It's ours!

299
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:51,410
I hope she picks Ddong-kwang right away
and you get dunked in the water.

300
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:54,440
[Could it happen three times in a row?]

301
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:57,320
<i>If it happens again,
our mom really is a hustler.</i>

302
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:00,720
Rock-paper-scissors.

303
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:03,920
[Hae Sook wins the round of
Rock-paper-scissors again.]

304
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,600
Just what is it that you're
not good at?

305
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:09,450
[Hae Sook's sons in a very upbeat mood.]

306
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,650
One, two, three.

307
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:14,920
[Passes again!]

308
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:18,420
Ddong-kwang!
Ddong-kwang!

309
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:20,840
Our aunt will get?

310
00:17:22,330 --> 00:17:24,850
[Thank goodness.]
Oh my gosh! I'm so nervous!

311
00:17:24,850 --> 00:17:27,140
I seriously feel like
I'm going out of my mind.

312
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:30,600
Please help us go home in
our dry clothes.

313
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:33,210
Mom!
You have to pick the right one!

314
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:49,580
[Their dreams of going home in nice and
dry clothes are shattered.]

315
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:58,640
Okay, let the real party begin!

316
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:02,870
Okay, let's do this!
We're all wet now!

317
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:05,280
That's the real way to have fun
if you're going to play in the water!

318
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,820
It's okay, Mom!

319
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:11,610
[The two sons having been given
a cold wake up call.]

320
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:13,240
Ah In, are you seeing all this?

321
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,510
[That's going to be me soon.]

322
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:17,260
This is going to be you soon.

323
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:20,290
[All their fears dissipated the moment
they were dunked in the water.]

324
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:21,850
I don't fear being dunked
in the water anymore!

325
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:24,010
- Let's do this!
- Let's see how far we can take this!

326
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:25,610
- Let's see this through to the end!
- Let's see how far we can take this!

327
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:27,660
Mom, you have to cheat the cards.

328
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:30,730
[First set-
Ji Hyo- 1 : Hae Sook- 2.]

329
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:32,160
There you go!

330
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,540
[Hae Sook wins the game of
Rock-paper-scissors three times in a row.]

331
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:35,850
There you go!

332
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:38,000
[Bi-kwang - Pass!]

333
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:43,220
The party's begun now, so don't worry
and choose with confidence.

334
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,520
[Blank Ji also passes.]

335
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:50,910
Just fling us off the chair right now.

336
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:53,620
Mom, I don't want to go in
the water again.

337
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,270
[Sings a song out of the blue
with his utmost sincerity.]

338
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:02,440
<i>Mom, I'm so cold!</i>

339
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:04,940
<i>- I'm really cold.
- I don't want to go back in the water.</i>

340
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:09,540
- That's the one!
- Mom, that's the one!

341
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:12,290
[Whew! Pass.]

342
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:19,080
- This is really stressful.
- You're down to two cards again.

343
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,520
Go with the one in front of you.

344
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,680
- Which one will the son pick?
- The one to the left.

345
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,810
You're picking the one on the left again!
Darn!

346
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:27,800
This family can't agree on anything!

347
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,330
Okay, I'll go with this one.

348
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:31,790
[Blank Ji going with her son's
wishes again.]

349
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:35,190
[Just who will flip over the Ddong-kwang?]

350
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:48,140
[Party time!]

351
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:53,310
What is wrong with our family!

352
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:55,190
You!

353
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:56,300
[Hae Sook's family wins the first set.]

354
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:58,370
[Brothers, I'm so sorry!]

355
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:03,570
We won.
We won the first round.

356
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:06,270
Since there are only three of us,
one of you will have to go again.

357
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:10,110
[Suggesting that they decide who goes
with a game of hand flip.]

358
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:12,360
Just do what your older brother tells you.
You three are squabbling too much.

359
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:14,740
Hand flip!

360
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:17,200
[Big-nosed Brother and Kkuk.]

361
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:21,860
- I didn't want to be chosen!
- Mom!

362
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,080
[Oh no...]

363
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:32,060
[A dead grasshopper in the water...]

364
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:34,520
- No, don't do it!
- That's not how you grab it!

365
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:40,490
[This is how you do it...]

366
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:44,740
[You must show your respect
for the grasshopper.]

367
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:51,220
[Shaking his head in despair...]

368
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:53,380
- We can save it!
- Scalpel!

369
00:20:56,840 --> 00:21:03,490
[The grasshopper having lost its life
in the swimming pool.]

370
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,240
Goodbye.

371
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:10,060
Here, have a seat.
Have a seat.

372
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:12,130
To be honest, I'm not
that much younger than our mom.

373
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:14,790
Sit down.
Please just sit down.

374
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:18,620
[His older brother's tear soaked confession.]

375
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:20,340
Rock-paper-scissors.

376
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:21,410
[Round two.]

377
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:23,590
[Invincible in the game of
rock-paper-scissors?]

378
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:25,910
- She's like you, Suk Jin.
- I must take after our mom.

379
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:28,480
[It seems as though Big-nosed Brother's
skills must be hereditary from his mom.]

380
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,560
One, two, three.

381
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:36,100
- Just relax and pick one.
- Let it be the ddong-kwang!

382
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:46,290
[Relax and enjoy the flight.]

383
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:54,560
- Mom, mom, mom!
- Mom!

384
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,540
Mom, mom, mom!

385
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,680
Mom, what are you doing!

386
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:04,680
[Having picked the wrong card
right off the bat.]

387
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:07,000
Ah In looked really happy to see
them getting flown off their chairs.

388
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,140
[Ah In seeming to be too happy to see
his cousins flung off their chairs?]

389
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:14,190
Mom, mom, mom!

390
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:19,130
Our mom doesn't mess around.
I can't believe that was her first draw.

391
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:24,340
Mom, since we're already in this state,
pick the card again and let's just end it.

392
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:26,310
What are you talking about?

393
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:27,570
[Seeming too excited all on his own.]

394
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:31,780
[Wow... a master at rock-paper-scissors.]

395
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:33,930
- She won again?
- Pick one on the count of three.

396
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:37,290
[Will she pick it on her first draw again?]

397
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:40,120
Draw the card!

398
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:47,780
- Ugh, I'm so nervous.
- This is really nerve-wrecking.

399
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:50,770
Ddong-kwang.
Ddong-kwang.

400
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:52,890
- Ddong-kwang.
- Please!

401
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,660
Why do I feel so nervous!

402
00:22:57,660 --> 00:23:00,610
[All the men feeling their hearts
about to thump out of their chests.]

403
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:01,940
- Mom!
- Don't pick the Ddong-kwang.

404
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:04,080
One, two, three.

405
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:07,730
[Passes again.]

406
00:23:07,730 --> 00:23:10,410
Thank you, Mom.
This is making me so anxious.

407
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:12,670
[About to lose his mind?]

408
00:23:15,410 --> 00:23:18,650
[Feeling more anxious as the number of
cards to choose from diminishes.]

409
00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:20,710
You have to draw the Ddong-kwang
in order for me to survive.

410
00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:23,570
Go with the one on the right.

411
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:25,770
Okay, my son.
I'm going to listen to my son.

412
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:28,810
[Listening to her son,
and choosing the card on the right.]

413
00:23:28,810 --> 00:23:29,840
Three!

414
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:46,920
[With her youngest son in the seat,
she chooses Ddong-kwang twice in a row.]

415
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:50,370
I can go home in my nice and
dry clothes!

416
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:53,560
Mom, let's just get it over with.
Pick the card again.

417
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:58,450
I didn't have a choice in the matter.
She got to choose the card.

418
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,290
She didn't get a choice in the matter.

419
00:24:00,290 --> 00:24:01,860
Let's make this a clean win, Ji Hyo.

420
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,670
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Don't win. Let her pick again.

421
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:07,150
[As always, Hae Sook wins the game.]

422
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:08,170
I can't believe she won again.

423
00:24:08,170 --> 00:24:11,120
Mom, don't just win at the rock-paper-scissors
but stop drawing the Ddong-kwang card.

424
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,490
What does it matter if you keep
winning at that?

425
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:17,400
Just put them out of their misery,
and end this round for them.

426
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:21,210
Just draw the card right out the door,
and end this pain for them.

427
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:24,110
[Her sons asking her to just end it
and put them out of their misery.]

428
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:25,640
Draw the card.
Draw the card!

429
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,600
[What will she draw?]

430
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:31,140
[Oh my...]

431
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:34,630
[My goodness...]

432
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:36,440
Mom, I'm really cold.

433
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:46,370
[No need to cower in fear any longer.
Three times in a row...]

434
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:53,590
[How can this be?]

435
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:59,880
[Second round victory goes to
nice and dry Ji Hyo's family.]

436
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:04,810
[I'm so sorry.]

437
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:08,400
I never even imagined that the round
would end like this.

438
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:13,300
[Three times in a row... amazing.]

439
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,070
That was a great way to end the game!

440
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:19,840
[But there's still another round
left in the game.]

441
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:23,350
Since our youngest brother is a guest,
let him do it one more time.

442
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:27,180
- As for the other player...
- Why don't you do it like this?

443
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:29,520
- Ah In can...
- We'll take care of it ourselves!

444
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,600
We'll take care of it ourselves!

445
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:36,720
[Getting smacked for trying to help.]

446
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,510
Why are you butting into
our family's business?

447
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:41,830
- This is our family's matter.
- Yes, you're right.

448
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:45,040
No, but I've got a really good solution.

449
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:48,670
[But the cousin insists on
butting in to the end.]

450
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,980
[Ah In and...]

451
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:54,550
[Kwang Soo?]

452
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:02,190
- What was that for?
- What?

453
00:26:02,190 --> 00:26:05,380
[The unlucky Giraffe having been
chosen to take the seat again...]

454
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:07,650
[The final round with the fate of
the resort hanging on the balance.]

455
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:11,220
Mom, mom!
Please dunk Ah In in the water.

456
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:14,100
[Their goal is to get
nice and dry Ah In all wet?]

457
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:16,770
I'll dunk Ah In in the water myself.

458
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:19,130
Why, Mom?
Why would you want to do that?

459
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,510
Rock-paper-scissors.

460
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:24,620
[She just may become a legend
of rock-paper-scissors.]

461
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:27,120
She's good at rock-paper-scissors, but
she's also good at drawing the ddong card.

462
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:41,870
- Ah In. Ah In...
- Send him in the water.

463
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:45,140
- That's the card.
- Send him flying.

464
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:46,860
Send him flying gin the air.

465
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,840
[Wow... there it is.]

466
00:26:57,980 --> 00:27:02,870
[The machine malfunctions, and only
Kwang Soo gets dunked in the water.]

467
00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:06,320
I'm sorry, but you need to
get back up there.

468
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,340
Why do I need to get dunked again
when I just got dunked?

469
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:10,000
[So confused...]

470
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,180
Only he needs to get dunked
since I just got dunked myself.

471
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:14,230
We only need to get dunked
once, don't we?

472
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,800
What wrong have I ever done?

473
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:19,480
[It's working just fine now.]

474
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:30,000
Did you see Ah In?
Did you see his face?

475
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:34,900
[His first cold taste of the variety world.]

476
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:37,000
[Welcome...
Your first flying chair experience, right?]

477
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:41,740
[Totally... speechless.]

478
00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:45,060
That was cool.

479
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:47,890
Remember what Ah In said about
it looking like it would be fun?

480
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:50,100
It really is a ton of fun!

481
00:27:51,490 --> 00:27:53,590
He says it's fun.

482
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:57,450
- How do you feel now, Ah In?
- Seriously... it's not that bad.

483
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:01,120
[Pretending to be fine.]
All of you are just scaredy cats.

484
00:28:01,670 --> 00:28:04,580
Hey, what do you mean, we're the scared ones?
You screamed the loudest out of all of us.

485
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:06,970
[His false sense of confidence
being called out on.]

486
00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:12,250
Kwang Soo got dunked in the water again
over a technical mistake.

487
00:28:12,610 --> 00:28:14,980
[Kwang Soo being dunked unfairly due to
a malfunction wasn't even acknowledged...]

488
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:17,490
No one even cares about
what happens to me anymore.

489
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:22,380
Kwang Soo just gets dunked again
as if it's a given.

490
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:25,220
Rock-paper-scissors.

491
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:27,530
[She wins Rock-paper-scissors again.]

492
00:28:27,530 --> 00:28:30,770
[Dubbed the new goddess of
Rock-paper-scissors.]

493
00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:33,900
- What in the world is going on with her?
- I can see that Ji Hyo's mad right now.

494
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:36,800
- What's gotten into you, Mom?
- Mom, send Ah In in the water again.

495
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:39,840
- Yes, send him back in the water.
- One, two, three.

496
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:42,440
[Pass]

497
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:45,600
This is driving me crazy.
This is driving us in our seats crazy.

498
00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:48,590
It's really nerve-wrecking for us too.

499
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:52,040
Okay, Song Ji Hyo.
One, two, three.

500
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,320
[Blank Ji also passes her turn.]

501
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,370
I'm going to pick it from this side.

502
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:14,020
[Taking their flight in turn?]

503
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:16,530
- Wow, doing it like that was cool.
- That was cool.

504
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,660
Okay, fine.
I got it now.

505
00:29:21,130 --> 00:29:23,580
So you're going to fling us in the air
in turn like that, is that it?

506
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:25,910
Oh no, I feel awful!

507
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,280
This is how you party!

508
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:29,210
[What kind of a party is this?]

509
00:29:29,210 --> 00:29:31,530
What are you thinking having a pool party
in this kind of a weather?

510
00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:35,560
- Pick the card, pick the card.
- Please!

511
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:36,870
One, two, three!

512
00:29:37,890 --> 00:29:39,690
[Frozen as ice?]

513
00:29:43,470 --> 00:29:46,370
- What's wrong? I thought you weren't nervous.
- No, I'm really enjoying this right now.

514
00:29:46,370 --> 00:29:48,820
- Wow, this is so much fun.
- You're having fun, you say?

515
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:51,410
- This is really a lot of fun.
- Don't lie, I can see your lips trembling.

516
00:29:51,410 --> 00:29:54,130
[Continuing to insist he's having fun
even though his lips won't stop trembling.]

517
00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:56,120
Just pick whichever one you want.
Don't be nervous, it's okay.

518
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:58,470
- Which one?
- Pick the one right in front of you.

519
00:29:58,470 --> 00:29:59,800
- This one?
- Yeah, that one.

520
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,210
No, I don't know.

521
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:04,550
- No, don't pick that one!
- Pick whichever one you want.

522
00:30:04,550 --> 00:30:06,590
- One, two, three!
- That one!

523
00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:09,650
[Pass]

524
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:14,670
My heart is pounding.

525
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,870
[A fifty percent chance.
Only two cards left in the mix.]

526
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:19,020
[Husband Gary recommends that she
chooses the card to the left.]

527
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:21,050
- Are you sure?
- How about my youngest son picks?

528
00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:23,660
- My youngest son can pick.
- I'll go with my dad's choice.

529
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:25,600
[Youngest son, Ah In goes with his dad,
and chooses the card to the left.]

530
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,260
Pick the card in the middle!

531
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:30,160
- Listen to me for once, and pick.
- I think you should pick the middle one.

532
00:30:30,170 --> 00:30:32,010
Let's go with the one our
youngest son chose.

533
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:35,390
[Going with the card on the left as dad, Gary
and youngest son, Ah In instructed.]

534
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:36,980
One.

535
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:39,910
Two.

536
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:41,980
Three!

537
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:46,940
[Wow...]

538
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:49,860
[Guess who it is?]

539
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:03,040
[Starts to clap automatically.]

540
00:31:05,410 --> 00:31:07,650
It always works when my youngest son
and I are in sync.

541
00:31:08,010 --> 00:31:09,520
Okay, let's do this.

542
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:16,730
[Taking out his anger on the
older brother.]

543
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:21,740
[Round Three-
Ji Hyo- 2 : Hae Sook- 1]

544
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:24,180
It's okay, Mom.
Don't worry. I like being in the water.

545
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:29,710
I don't think...
we should do water games anymore.

546
00:31:29,710 --> 00:31:31,290
[Water games are no longer feasible?]

547
00:31:31,290 --> 00:31:34,880
Thank you to all our viewers for having
watched and enjoyed all the water games.

548
00:31:34,890 --> 00:31:38,590
- But as for these water games...
- We'll see them again next summer!

549
00:31:39,150 --> 00:31:41,890
Water games... goodbye!

550
00:31:42,850 --> 00:31:45,390
And seashore games... goodbye!

551
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,650
- And rice paddies too.
- Oh right, the rice paddies.

552
00:31:46,650 --> 00:31:49,270
Rice paddies... goodbye!

553
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:53,390
Goodbyes to the seashore mud flats,
swimming pools, rice paddies...

554
00:31:53,390 --> 00:31:55,340
and what's our next goodbye?
Goodbye to Ah In?

555
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:58,050
Let's just round it out to an even goodbye.
Four goodbyes at once.

556
00:31:58,050 --> 00:32:01,800
- One, two...
- Goodbye, Ah In.

557
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,640
Three.

558
00:32:17,930 --> 00:32:19,970
[Goodbye...]

559
00:32:19,970 --> 00:32:22,010
[Ah In.]

560
00:32:24,930 --> 00:32:27,290
[Just as they said...]

561
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:35,580
I can't believe that happened.

562
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:40,980
- I feel so bad.
- You scare me.

563
00:32:41,370 --> 00:32:43,940
I can't believe you sent Ah In flying like
that right after you said goodbye to him.

564
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:45,750
- I feel so bad.
- 'Goodbye, Ah In.'

565
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,320
Goodbye, Ah In.

566
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,780
The current score is, two to two
at our third round.

567
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:54,030
Kwang Soo, you're totally soaking wet.

568
00:32:54,030 --> 00:32:55,900
He looks like a wet dish rag.

569
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,670
How can you compare me to
a wet dish rag?

570
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:02,300
How can you say that to your nephew?

571
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:07,520
[Holidays should be spent with your family...
Adverse effects of too much family time.]

572
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:10,190
This is the final round.
This round will determine the winner.

573
00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:16,330
[The fate of grandmother's resort
is balancing on the line.]

574
00:33:16,330 --> 00:33:17,950
- Fighting.
- Mom, we have to win this.

575
00:33:18,210 --> 00:33:19,780
Fighting.

576
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:24,390
Since this is the last round,
why don't the two mothers say something?

577
00:33:24,390 --> 00:33:26,700
- Say something to your sons.
- Goodbye, Ah In.

578
00:33:29,810 --> 00:33:31,390
Mom!

579
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:36,050
- What about Kwang Soo?
- Why don't you just get a scarecrow instead?

580
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:39,440
You just keep ignoring me
more and more as the time goes by!

581
00:33:40,010 --> 00:33:42,150
I don't think the cameras are even
filming me anymore.

582
00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:46,770
Hey, you're like nothing but
a shadow right now.

583
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:52,180
- The resort will be ours.
- Yes!

584
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:55,150
- The resort will be ours.
- Rock-Paper-scissors.

585
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:58,360
[Wins the rock-paper-scissors game
all the way through to the end.]

586
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:01,440
- This is the final round, right?
- This is the decisive round.

587
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:04,190
- I feel so anxious.
- Flip the card over on the count of three.

588
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,760
- Here we go.
- Fighting.

589
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:08,430
[The final decisive round with
the fate of the resort hanging on the line.]

590
00:34:08,830 --> 00:34:10,170
Two.

591
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:12,280
Three!

592
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:13,630
Come on!

593
00:34:14,410 --> 00:34:15,480
Three!

594
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:16,910
Come on!

595
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:23,290
[Pass]

596
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:27,080
- Goodbye, Ah In.
- Goodbye, Ah In.

597
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:29,420
Ji Hyo, can you say goodbye
to Ah In one more time?

598
00:34:29,430 --> 00:34:30,980
[Everyone seems to want to hear Ji Hyo
say goodbye to Ah In?]

599
00:34:32,050 --> 00:34:34,960
Does our family not care about
inheriting the resort for ourselves?

600
00:34:35,430 --> 00:34:36,670
This is all your fault!

601
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:40,430
[What is it that we're working
so hard for?]

602
00:34:40,430 --> 00:34:44,090
- Our family apparently doesn't care.
- Goodbye, Ah In.

603
00:34:44,090 --> 00:34:47,740
[Ji Hyo's family cares more about dunking
Ah In rather than getting the fortune.]

604
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:52,040
- One... two...
- Let's do it. Pick the card!

605
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,210
Three!

606
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:58,500
- Goodbye, Ah In.
- Let's send them away.

607
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:02,010
- Goodbye, Ah In.
- Goodbye, Ah In.

608
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:13,800
[Goodbye]

609
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:25,650
[Guess you're not getting the resort.
Goodbye, Ah In...]

610
00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:32,770
- The spell worked!
- 'Goodbye, Ah In' spell worked!

611
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:37,590
Goodbye, water games.
Goodbye, seashore mud flat games.

612
00:35:37,590 --> 00:35:41,130
Goodbye, rice paddies.
Goodbye, Ah In!

613
00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:43,800
- We won. The resort is ours.
- We won?

614
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:48,000
Thus, Orange Team wins!

615
00:35:48,890 --> 00:35:51,050
[Team Hae Sook wins!]

616
00:35:51,050 --> 00:35:55,010
Resort is ours!
Resort is ours!

617
00:35:55,010 --> 00:36:01,060
- Our mom is a hustler. Our mom is a hustler!
- Goodbye, Ah In!

618
00:36:04,290 --> 00:36:07,230
<i>The winning team may first
choose one of these two boxes.</i>

619
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:10,690
- Which one should we go with?
- We need to go with the 'Top' box.

620
00:36:10,690 --> 00:36:12,170
- You're choosing that one?
- Yes, we'll go with this.

621
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:16,150
<i>You can't open the box until
I tell you to.</i>

622
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:18,680
- Yes, we understand.
- Make sure to keep it with you.

623
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:21,740
<i>You can open the envelope and figure out
where to go for your next location.</i>

624
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:23,490
[The letter contains their next location.]

625
00:36:23,850 --> 00:36:26,020
<i>[You must be hungry after
playing in the water...]</i>

626
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:28,880
- No, I'm actually more cold than hungry.
- It says to go to the 'D' restaurant.

627
00:36:29,350 --> 00:36:32,150
[Yes!
We're going to go eat!]

628
00:36:32,650 --> 00:36:33,930
Mom!

629
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:35,450
- Mom, let's go.
- Let's go quickly.

630
00:36:36,850 --> 00:36:39,280
- The resort is ours!
- The resort is ours!

631
00:36:43,490 --> 00:36:45,640
That's the most I've laughed
in a very long time.

632
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:47,430
- We're off to a very good start.
- I have a good feeling about this.

633
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:51,190
- We seem to fit very well together.
- So the resort is ours right now?

634
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,910
- Yes, it is.
- Then we need to get the land next.

635
00:36:53,910 --> 00:36:55,750
[Slowly gaining all the fortune one by one.]

636
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:57,830
We're going to have to do a good job
in the next game too.

637
00:36:58,190 --> 00:37:00,360
I'm going to keep everything in
my possession for now...

638
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:04,370
and I'm going to give it little by little
to those of you who are good to me.

639
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,890
- You're not going to give us a lot?
- No, just a little bit at a time.

640
00:37:08,290 --> 00:37:11,830
[Ji Hyo's family reminiscing
about their time in the past.]

641
00:37:12,490 --> 00:37:15,380
It seems just like yesterday that he was born,
but our youngest is already 28 years old.

642
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:18,360
- I remember when he was still in diapers.
- How old were you two back then?

643
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:19,800
I was a year old.

644
00:37:20,390 --> 00:37:22,540
And I was eight years old.

645
00:37:24,610 --> 00:37:28,540
Honey, we should take the kids
and go live in America.

646
00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:30,420
- Why, Father?
- Why would we move to America?

647
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:34,480
- So that we can go clubbing together.
- Why would you go clubbing at your age?

648
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:37,020
You should focus on staying home more.

649
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:40,280
I'm so sick and tired of having to
sleep in Room 34, Father.

650
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,930
I remember grabbing a glow stick
on my one hundredth day celebration.

651
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:52,800
- We're here.
- Yes, we're here.

652
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:53,950
[Arrives at the restaurant.]

653
00:37:55,790 --> 00:37:57,980
[Traditional Korean restaurant overflowing
with regal charm and history.]

654
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:05,000
[But inside the restaurant...
is a setup for some sort of a game?]

655
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:06,710
Aren't you going to feed us?

656
00:38:06,710 --> 00:38:08,780
I don't think we're here to eat,
but we're here to play a game.

657
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:10,940
[You don't think that we're just going to
feed you for free, do you?]

658
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:12,940
The two daughters need to
come up here first.

659
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:16,390
- He asked for the two daughters.
- Come up here and get your letters.

660
00:38:16,390 --> 00:38:17,920
We don't have to ride this up there?

661
00:38:19,350 --> 00:38:20,970
- Is this for the older daughter?
- Yes.

662
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:22,700
<i>[I know that you're all working very hard.]</i>

663
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:26,810
<i>[I've prepared a mission that will
test your taste buds' knowledge.]</i>

664
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:30,720
<i>[Your second mission is,
'Food Battle of your Five Senses'.</i>

665
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,950
<i>that will require the usage
of all your five sensory skills.]</i>

666
00:38:32,950 --> 00:38:35,990
<i>You have to scoot up to the table
on your cushions</i>

667
00:38:35,990 --> 00:38:39,420
<i>and you have to place your cushion
on top of the table first</i>

668
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:41,260
<i>in order to be given a chance
to answer the question posed.</i>

669
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:43,590
[First person to place their cushion on
the table will get to answer the question.]

670
00:38:43,590 --> 00:38:47,180
<i>The family with the most members to answer
the questions first will win the game.</i>

671
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:49,160
- Yes, I understand.
- We're confident we can win this.

672
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:54,240
- First up, we'll play an auditory game.
- Auditory game.

673
00:38:54,890 --> 00:38:56,250
- I can do this.
- We will get started.

674
00:38:57,060 --> 00:39:00,960
[All of the different sounds
that are made when cooking.]

675
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:04,480
[Will they be able to guess what dish is
being prepared from hearing the sound?]

676
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,690
- You have to guess which dish it is.
- Okay.

677
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:10,010
<i>Okay, we will now start the questions.</i>

678
00:39:17,610 --> 00:39:21,980
[It's not a very familiar sound.]

679
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:27,560
Something is being taken out
of a package.

680
00:39:27,570 --> 00:39:29,650
Something's being taken out.

681
00:39:29,650 --> 00:39:32,260
[Ha Ha's going to try to
guess the answer?]

682
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:33,980
I think I know this sound.

683
00:39:35,950 --> 00:39:37,110
Okay, Ha Ha.

684
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,470
Ha Ha?

685
00:39:41,310 --> 00:39:43,490
Ramyun?

686
00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:48,950
Didn't it sound like that?
Like a package being torn open?

687
00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:51,180
I have absolutely no idea.

688
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:54,960
[Listening to it again
still doesn't seem to help any.]

689
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:57,500
- Is it the sound of a fish being cleaned?
- Taking out the organs?

690
00:39:57,500 --> 00:40:00,450
[Hae Sook and Ah In races forward.]

691
00:40:04,790 --> 00:40:07,550
[Ah In's cushion slips off.]

692
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:10,170
Kim Hae Sook.

693
00:40:10,190 --> 00:40:12,470
- That's our mom!
- Kim Hae Sook's cushion made it.

694
00:40:12,850 --> 00:40:14,770
- It's fish...
- Yes?

695
00:40:14,770 --> 00:40:16,740
I didn't hear it all the way through.

696
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:19,660
So it's either spicy fish stew,
broiled fish, or pan fried fish.

697
00:40:20,250 --> 00:40:24,450
[Huh? Three different answers?]

698
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:31,200
Since all I heard was the fish being cleaned
and I raced up here after hearing that...

699
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:35,760
So I'm saying it's either spicy fish stew,
broiled fish, or pan fried fish.

700
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,310
- You can't give three different answers.
- Just one answer.

701
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:38,380
- You have to give just one answer.
- You're doing great, Mom.

702
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:39,810
Spicy fish stew!

703
00:40:41,010 --> 00:40:42,690
Then broiled fish.

704
00:40:43,090 --> 00:40:44,780
Broiled cutlass fish?

705
00:40:44,790 --> 00:40:46,370
Broiled cutlass fish!

706
00:40:46,810 --> 00:40:50,300
[Madame Kim,
the Queen of Stubbornness.]

707
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:52,330
Mom, you did good.

708
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:53,790
Here's your hint.
It's something you eat often.

709
00:40:53,790 --> 00:40:56,900
- It's easy to make, and you eat it often.
- Really?

710
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:03,390
[Just what is the dish behind this sound?]

711
00:41:03,390 --> 00:41:07,150
[The sound of a cucumber being sliced.]

712
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:12,150
I have no idea.

713
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:16,010
[The definitive sound of
crabmeat being opened!]

714
00:41:16,930 --> 00:41:21,610
[And after ham is grilled to perfection.]

715
00:41:21,610 --> 00:41:25,200
[All our viewers...
Can you guess what it is by now?]

716
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,750
- I think she knows what it is.
- Whatever. Let's just get up there and see.

717
00:41:31,090 --> 00:41:33,630
- Grilled buttered calamari.
- Grilled buttered calamari?

718
00:41:33,630 --> 00:41:35,720
- Take back the buttered out.
- Calamari...

719
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:38,480
- Grilled margarine calamari.
- Hey, that's the same thing!

720
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:41,160
- What kind of an answer is that?
- That's the incorrect answer.

721
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:43,790
It's something that's easy to make,
and something that you eat often.

722
00:41:43,790 --> 00:41:45,180
Jae Suk, is it this?

723
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:47,950
Jae Suk, what if it's this?
(Kimbap)

724
00:41:49,830 --> 00:41:51,800
- Your answer is?
- Grilled ham.

725
00:41:54,230 --> 00:41:55,990
Hey, he says that's not it!

726
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:59,260
- What were you thinking?
- I was just saying what came to mind.

727
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:02,000
- You know that's not it.
- You have to come up with your own answers.

728
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,880
- I was thinking of something else.
- Tell me what you were thinking.

729
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:06,430
Just tell me what you were thinking.

730
00:42:06,430 --> 00:42:08,300
I think I know what it is.
It's very common, isn't it?

731
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:09,760
- Yes, it's very common.
- Found everywhere?

732
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,500
- It's very common.
- Kimbap.

733
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:14,120
- Come on, that's not it.
- Kimbap?

734
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:15,710
- Kimbap!
- Kimbap?

735
00:42:15,710 --> 00:42:17,970
[Correct answer]

736
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:24,780
[Finally starting to get what all the
mysterious sounds were.]

737
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:26,070
I still don't get it.

738
00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:27,810
[Time to check the answer.]

739
00:42:27,810 --> 00:42:33,340
[One- Sound of cucumber being sliced.]

740
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:35,130
So that was the sound of the knife
hitting the cutting board.

741
00:42:35,130 --> 00:42:38,940
[Two- Unwrapping the crabmeat.]

742
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:40,990
[So that's what that sound was!]

743
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:46,290
How are we supposed to know that those
sounds are the sounds of making kimbap?

744
00:42:46,290 --> 00:42:47,960
It's because of what he said
about it being a very common dish.

745
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:50,620
Of course! You need to baste it
in sesame oil for it to be true kimbap!

746
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:52,720
I want the ends.

747
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:55,600
[Ha Ha of Ji Hyo's family
gets the correct answer.]

748
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:58,150
For the next round, it'll be a taste test.

749
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:00,450
Taste test is one thing
that I'm confident in!

750
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:04,560
You have to come out here to
the table and get in line.

751
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,530
You have to line up in front of the table.

752
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:08,540
I'm confident that I can do this.

753
00:43:08,540 --> 00:43:10,940
You have to be remain honest,
and keep your eyes closed.

754
00:43:10,940 --> 00:43:12,510
[Keep your eyes tightly closed!]

755
00:43:12,510 --> 00:43:13,780
You cannot open your eyes.

756
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:19,780
[Some sort of fried food?]

757
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:23,500
[Kwang Soo is up first.]

758
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:27,280
[Fire!]

759
00:43:34,660 --> 00:43:36,780
- What?
- What is it?

760
00:43:38,730 --> 00:43:41,700
- What is it?
- What's wrong with you?

761
00:43:41,710 --> 00:43:44,780
[People in the back feeling nervous
after hearing Kwang Soo's screams.]

762
00:43:51,350 --> 00:43:53,680
[Finally starting to
attempt to taste the food.]

763
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:54,710
- What is it?
- What's wrong?

764
00:43:54,710 --> 00:43:57,230
- You have to finish what you're eating.
- Why, what is it?

765
00:43:57,230 --> 00:44:01,160
You have to keep your eyes up front.
You can't look behind you.

766
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:02,880
- What is it?
- What's wrong with him?

767
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:05,330
- What's wrong?
- Okay, time for you to tell me your answer.

768
00:44:06,790 --> 00:44:08,750
I've lost my sense of taste.

769
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:11,320
- What? You've lost your sense of taste?
- I can't taste anything.

770
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:15,330
Tell me what you think it is.

771
00:44:15,580 --> 00:44:17,620
- Fried oranges.
- Fried oranges?

772
00:44:18,460 --> 00:44:20,090
There are no such things
as fried oranges.

773
00:44:21,430 --> 00:44:22,790
What are you talking about?

774
00:44:22,790 --> 00:44:24,010
What was that?

775
00:44:24,010 --> 00:44:26,770
I thought that you threw a fire lit
match into my mouth.

776
00:44:26,770 --> 00:44:30,060
You should cool it down before
you shove it in our mouths.

777
00:44:30,060 --> 00:44:31,300
Yes, I understand.

778
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:33,630
Okay, we'll do another round.

779
00:44:33,630 --> 00:44:34,930
[Off they go again!]

780
00:44:41,650 --> 00:44:44,660
- Okay, you have to close your eyes.
- Kim Jong Kook, it's fried food!

781
00:44:44,660 --> 00:44:47,120
[I don't care if it means I can
take the victory!]

782
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:48,840
Just shove it down his throat.

783
00:44:49,930 --> 00:44:52,430
[Fried food that he wouldn't even
normally glimpse at sideways...]

784
00:44:52,430 --> 00:44:56,200
[Health conscious body lover who cares about
his body more than anything else.]

785
00:44:58,990 --> 00:45:00,710
Hang on a second.

786
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:03,560
- Is it hot?
- Why is it so hot?

787
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:04,990
You have to finish what's in your mouth.

788
00:45:05,950 --> 00:45:08,350
You have to put it all in your mouth.

789
00:45:08,730 --> 00:45:12,630
[Aren't you going to chew it?
Aren't you going to swallow it?]

790
00:45:12,630 --> 00:45:16,550
He doesn't know much about taste
because all he eats is chicken breasts.

791
00:45:16,550 --> 00:45:19,280
Try to guess what it is.

792
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:21,000
What is this?

793
00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:24,750
- Can't you tell just by tasting it?
- Time for you to give your answer.

794
00:45:24,750 --> 00:45:26,590
Why is everyone having
such a hard time with it?

795
00:45:27,710 --> 00:45:29,190
This is no joke.

796
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:32,250
[Still thinking about it.]

797
00:45:32,250 --> 00:45:34,010
- You have to tell me what it is.
- He's going to say fried oranges too.

798
00:45:35,050 --> 00:45:36,250
No, it's not an orange.

799
00:45:36,250 --> 00:45:38,190
It's going to taste like fried oranges
no matter how many of them you try.

800
00:45:38,890 --> 00:45:42,300
- Grapefruit!
- Grapefruit, orange... it's the same thing.

801
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:44,040
Fried grapefruit?

802
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:45,210
[That rare... fried grapefruit?]

803
00:45:45,210 --> 00:45:46,510
Fried grapefruit?
Is that your answer?

804
00:45:47,290 --> 00:45:50,340
- No, that's incorrect.
- It must be something citrus.

805
00:45:50,340 --> 00:45:52,160
[It seems as though it must be
something fruity of some sorts.]

806
00:45:52,170 --> 00:45:53,840
It wasn't grapefruit either.

807
00:45:55,260 --> 00:45:57,310
Fried orange, fried grapefruit.
Same difference!

808
00:45:57,310 --> 00:45:58,930
I'm sure it's an orange.

809
00:45:58,930 --> 00:46:00,990
It's something that I've never had before.

810
00:46:00,990 --> 00:46:02,190
[Something he's never had before...]

811
00:46:02,230 --> 00:46:05,050
[Just what could be inside that fried batter?]

812
00:46:09,350 --> 00:46:11,180
[The identity of what's inside is...]

813
00:46:11,180 --> 00:46:13,800
[Gummy worms!]

814
00:46:14,330 --> 00:46:17,150
- Okay, prepare yourselves.
- I think it's something rare and expensive.

815
00:46:17,150 --> 00:46:19,190
Ready... go!

816
00:46:19,190 --> 00:46:20,460
[Back to the table!]

817
00:46:22,860 --> 00:46:24,970
[While everyone is stuck in the melee,
Ah In pushes himself forward!]

818
00:46:26,570 --> 00:46:28,880
[What about the cushion?]

819
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:31,080
Your cushion!

820
00:46:34,060 --> 00:46:37,520
[These four didn't even budge an inch
because they were tangled up in a mob.]

821
00:46:39,010 --> 00:46:41,650
[Getting himself poised seriously
to taste the food.]

822
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:44,020
It's really hot.

823
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:49,270
[Will Ah In's taste buds
tell him what it is?]

824
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:50,830
- Everyone can now open their eyes.
- It's fried food of some sorts.

825
00:46:50,830 --> 00:46:53,120
- You can't look behind you.
- I keep smelling fried food.

826
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:54,450
Can't you go lighter on the batter?

827
00:46:54,450 --> 00:46:56,240
So there's not much of whatever's inside,
and there's a lot of batter?

828
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:58,600
So it's 90% batter, and 10% filling?

829
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:02,460
Ah In, can you peel off the batter
inside your mouth?

830
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:04,590
Don't try to overthink it too much.

831
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:08,700
There you go.
Think.

832
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:10,700
- This isn't fruit.
- Really?

833
00:47:11,820 --> 00:47:13,600
- No, it's fruit.
- I'll give you five seconds.

834
00:47:14,750 --> 00:47:17,560
[He must give his answer
within five seconds.]

835
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:19,260
Two.

836
00:47:19,260 --> 00:47:20,460
One.

837
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:22,380
Wait!
Just wait.

838
00:47:23,510 --> 00:47:25,570
[Begging desperately?]

839
00:47:26,530 --> 00:47:29,550
[Rebel resorts to begging
when desperately cornered?]

840
00:47:29,550 --> 00:47:32,310
- What are you doing?
- Don't think too seriously about it.

841
00:47:32,310 --> 00:47:34,260
- What are you doing?
- Aren't you done eating it yet?

842
00:47:35,340 --> 00:47:37,170
You know what it is.
Say what it is that you're thinking.

843
00:47:37,170 --> 00:47:39,650
- What are you doing stalling time?
- Ah In!

844
00:47:39,650 --> 00:47:42,300
What's happened to you ever since
the flying chairs?

845
00:47:43,610 --> 00:47:45,970
- Five, four...
- It tastes like jelly of sorts.

846
00:47:45,980 --> 00:47:48,960
Fried gummy worms?

847
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:51,850
- Yes, fried gummy worms.
- Fried gummy worms?

848
00:47:51,850 --> 00:47:53,400
- I think he's got it.
- Really?

849
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:55,590
Yes, you've guessed correctly.

850
00:47:55,590 --> 00:47:58,360
- Yes, you've guessed correctly.
- Seriously?

851
00:47:58,360 --> 00:47:59,450
Yes, it was the fried gummy worms.

852
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:02,070
Are you telling me that you fed me both
the gummy and the fried batter?

853
00:48:03,140 --> 00:48:05,330
[Oh... the master of taste buds?]

854
00:48:05,330 --> 00:48:07,480
Wow, that's pretty impressive.

855
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:10,350
- He's got it.
- How did he guess that?

856
00:48:11,290 --> 00:48:13,450
- Seriously?
- You really have the ultimate taste buds.

857
00:48:13,450 --> 00:48:16,680
- I can't believe you got that.
- That was amazing.

858
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:19,130
- How did he guess that?
- How did he know that?

859
00:48:19,130 --> 00:48:20,870
[Ji Hyo's family passes the round
thanks to their youngest son, Ah In.]

860
00:48:21,570 --> 00:48:23,610
This was it.
Fried gummy worms.

861
00:48:23,610 --> 00:48:24,910
Ah, it was gummy worms.

862
00:48:24,910 --> 00:48:26,860
- Ah, this was it?
- The gummy worms?

863
00:48:26,860 --> 00:48:28,540
This was it.

864
00:48:29,010 --> 00:48:32,680
[Everyone grabbing a piece
as soon as they're brought out.]

865
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:34,780
- This is what it was?
- It's pretty good.

866
00:48:34,780 --> 00:48:37,040
Everyone should try making this at home.
It's really good.

867
00:48:38,450 --> 00:48:40,320
- This is really good.
- It's good.

868
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:42,510
[Fried gummy worms tasting much
better than anyone had anticipated.]

869
00:48:43,370 --> 00:48:45,110
[But one person remains stoic in the back.]

870
00:48:45,110 --> 00:48:46,850
Yeah, it's really good.

871
00:48:46,850 --> 00:48:50,160
- This is really good.
- How did you ever guess this correctly?

872
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:53,120
- It's all melted and gooey on the inside.
- How did you ever guess this, Ah In?

873
00:48:53,550 --> 00:48:57,060
[The dish is amazing, and Ah In
is amazing for having guessed it.]

874
00:48:57,580 --> 00:48:58,810
I knew that it wasn't real fruit.

875
00:48:58,820 --> 00:49:02,950
You're acting much differently now
that you've guessed it correctly.

876
00:49:06,810 --> 00:49:09,020
You're acting a bit cockier than before.

877
00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:11,520
It's all melted on the inside.

878
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:14,900
This time, it'll be a sense of touch.

879
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:17,390
I'm really bad at things like this.

880
00:49:20,940 --> 00:49:23,470
- Oh my God.
- Is it that bad?

881
00:49:24,230 --> 00:49:25,480
Don't do that!

882
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:27,320
[Did they just see something
really frightening?]

883
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,500
You have to keep your eyes closed.

884
00:49:31,290 --> 00:49:33,200
- It's moving around a little.
- Seriously?

885
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:36,040
- Why are you saying all that?
- This is a little... ugh!

886
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:37,740
Okay, you may now open your eyes.

887
00:49:37,740 --> 00:49:40,530
[The unseen terror.]

888
00:49:40,530 --> 00:49:42,820
It's moving around a bit,
and it's a little slimy too.

889
00:49:46,660 --> 00:49:49,220
[Older daughter Hae Sook is the only one
eagerly making her way forward.]

890
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:51,150
Okay, go ahead.

891
00:49:51,630 --> 00:49:53,480
Just know that it could bite you.

892
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:54,850
He's lying.

893
00:49:54,850 --> 00:49:57,530
- He's lying to you. That's a lie.
- You have to stick your hand in a bit more.

894
00:49:57,530 --> 00:50:00,230
- You're not there yet. A little bit more.
- What the heck?

895
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:02,040
You have to touch it.

896
00:50:02,270 --> 00:50:05,900
[Frightened more than she should be
no thanks to the people in the back.]

897
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:10,750
Yes, that's it.

898
00:50:11,870 --> 00:50:14,470
[This is it! Mackerels.]

899
00:50:14,470 --> 00:50:17,500
- It's okay, Mom. Don't be afraid.
- Okay, no more!

900
00:50:17,510 --> 00:50:19,360
Wait, hang on.

901
00:50:20,150 --> 00:50:22,640
[Her stubbornness showing through again.]

902
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:27,670
[The rule enforcer steps in!]

903
00:50:27,670 --> 00:50:30,110
[Insistent mother still not
pulling her hand away.]

904
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:33,090
- You have to stop!
- You have to stop touching!

905
00:50:34,130 --> 00:50:36,480
You can't touch it anymore!

906
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:38,710
- You have to step back now!
- You have to stop touching it now.

907
00:50:38,710 --> 00:50:42,090
I came out on this show at my age,
so give me a little break.

908
00:50:42,090 --> 00:50:43,910
[The flustered corporate family lawyer.]

909
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:46,390
She's my mom!

910
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:51,810
Okay, you have to stop touching it now.

911
00:50:51,810 --> 00:50:53,430
Okay, you're now finished.

912
00:50:54,700 --> 00:50:56,800
[Attempting to glance a peek inside.]

913
00:50:58,370 --> 00:51:00,050
- You have to take your hand out.
- I didn't see what's inside.

914
00:51:00,050 --> 00:51:02,040
I didn't recognize it
because I have bad eyesight.

915
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:04,730
Okay, what is your answer?

916
00:51:05,090 --> 00:51:06,460
Mackerel.

917
00:51:07,170 --> 00:51:09,190
- Mackerel?
- Spanish mackerel.

918
00:51:09,850 --> 00:51:12,240
[Attempting to give
her multi-answer once again.]

919
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:14,430
- It's a fish.
- What kind of a fish is it?

920
00:51:14,430 --> 00:51:18,420
I don't want to tell you what kind it is.
It's my choice whether I tell you that or not.

921
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:20,610
- Fish.
- What kind of a fish?

922
00:51:20,610 --> 00:51:22,570
- It's a fish!
- I got that, but what kind of a fish?

923
00:51:22,570 --> 00:51:24,090
That's for me to know.

924
00:51:24,090 --> 00:51:25,610
What kind of a rule is that?

925
00:51:25,610 --> 00:51:27,040
It's a fish.

926
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:29,930
I don't know if it's a mackerel,
or Spanish mackerel, so I'll go with fish.

927
00:51:29,930 --> 00:51:31,620
Hey, Lady!

928
00:51:31,620 --> 00:51:33,840
- Don't you think that you're being too much?
- What do you mean, 'Hey, Lady'?

929
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:35,130
That's my mother that you're talking to.

930
00:51:35,130 --> 00:51:37,180
[The two cousins battling it out
over her ambiguous answer.]

931
00:51:37,470 --> 00:51:41,200
It's either a mackerel or Spanish mackerel.
Come on, give me a break!

932
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:43,520
They're both fish!

933
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:45,360
- Come on.
- Just give her a break.

934
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:49,650
[Trying to get him to go easy on her since
she hasn't been on a variety show in a while.]

935
00:51:49,650 --> 00:51:51,210
You can't argue your way
out of this one.

936
00:51:51,210 --> 00:51:53,450
This is my first time out on this show.

937
00:51:53,450 --> 00:51:55,420
I'll give you this much.
It's one of those two answers.

938
00:51:55,420 --> 00:51:57,030
- Really?
- It's one of those two answers.

939
00:51:57,030 --> 00:51:58,590
Is it two letters or three letters?

940
00:52:03,530 --> 00:52:06,040
- I can't tell you that.
- Just show me with your fingers.

941
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:07,670
- With my fingers?
- Yeah.

942
00:52:09,190 --> 00:52:10,540
Fish.

943
00:52:10,540 --> 00:52:11,830
Mackerel.

944
00:52:11,830 --> 00:52:13,850
- Mackerel?
- Are you sure?

945
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:18,270
[Finally gets the answer!]

946
00:52:19,740 --> 00:52:21,120
That's the correct answer.

947
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:26,060
This time, it'll be about your sense of smell.

948
00:52:26,060 --> 00:52:27,480
My nose is like a dog's nose.

949
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:29,510
With your eyes closed...

950
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:37,040
[Using your sense of smell...
guess the three side dishes.]

951
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:38,460
You can't eat it.
Wait a minute.

952
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:46,110
- Okay, no more smelling.
- That's egg roll up.

953
00:52:47,620 --> 00:52:49,760
[The correct answer is...]

954
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:51,430
[Stir-fried dried squid.]

955
00:52:51,430 --> 00:52:54,990
[Dried black beans... and egg roll up.]

956
00:52:54,990 --> 00:52:56,250
What is your correct answer?

957
00:52:56,250 --> 00:52:58,010
- Egg roll up.
- Egg roll up?

958
00:52:58,010 --> 00:53:00,120
He really does have the nose
of a bloodhound.

959
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:02,020
- Perelli leaves.
- Perelli leaves?

960
00:53:02,740 --> 00:53:03,890
No, that's incorrect.

961
00:53:03,930 --> 00:53:05,240
[What could it be?]

962
00:53:05,870 --> 00:53:08,710
[It seems as though the stir-fried squid
is throwing everyone off.]

963
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:12,590
What's the second side dish?

964
00:53:12,590 --> 00:53:14,320
No, you can't eat it.
Wait.

965
00:53:14,410 --> 00:53:16,430
[Sticking his nose in there.]

966
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:19,780
- I'm not touching!
- You're not touching?

967
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:22,340
I think I have an idea.

968
00:53:22,340 --> 00:53:24,530
- It's egg roll up.
- Egg roll up.

969
00:53:25,220 --> 00:53:29,470
It's something that's cooked in soy sauce.
I can smell soy sauce in it.

970
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,490
[It's time for you to give your answer.]

971
00:53:33,950 --> 00:53:37,300
- The soy sauce has been...
- We got it, so spit out the answer!

972
00:53:38,190 --> 00:53:39,720
- You have to give your answer.
- The soy sauce...

973
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:42,640
- It's been simmered in soy sauce.
- This isn't a cooking show.

974
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:44,440
- Egg roll up.
- Egg roll up?

975
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:46,500
- Pickled garlic root.
- Garlic root?

976
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:49,430
- Is your nose stuffed up?
- What did you say?

977
00:53:50,090 --> 00:53:52,830
I just didn't know.
I wasn't sure what it was.

978
00:53:52,830 --> 00:53:56,110
- I think my nose may be stuffed up.
- Mix up Ji Hyo and Gary.

979
00:53:56,110 --> 00:53:59,010
I'm not going to say anything else.
Just mix up Ji Hyo and Gary.

980
00:53:59,420 --> 00:54:01,010
- You're right here, aren't you?
- No.

981
00:54:01,020 --> 00:54:02,020
I'm going to beat you.

982
00:54:02,020 --> 00:54:04,500
[Still able to find his frenemy
even with his eyes blindfolded.]

983
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:06,040
I'm going to beat you!

984
00:54:06,040 --> 00:54:08,580
- You'd better be careful.
- I'm sorry, what I did was wrong.

985
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:11,400
How did he know that I was here?
Can he see me?

986
00:54:12,350 --> 00:54:13,530
How did he know that I was here?

987
00:54:13,540 --> 00:54:16,240
- Egg Roll up. Black beans.
- Egg Roll up. Black beans.

988
00:54:17,170 --> 00:54:19,540
- Stir-fried squid.
- Stir-fried squid?

989
00:54:19,540 --> 00:54:22,610
[Ah... so close!]

990
00:54:23,910 --> 00:54:25,180
[No, that's not it!]

991
00:54:28,010 --> 00:54:30,180
[Still able to single out Ro-Ro
even with his eyes blindfolded.]

992
00:54:30,180 --> 00:54:32,320
- Salted squid.
- Salted squid?

993
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:35,060
- Salted squid?
- That was so close.

994
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:38,910
[Kwang Soo's turn.]

995
00:54:49,490 --> 00:54:53,190
[Just like Kwang Soo's friend
whom we saw in the past...]

996
00:54:53,190 --> 00:54:56,540
[Kwang Soo sticking out his tongue
and licking his way towards his food.]

997
00:54:56,540 --> 00:54:58,350
Okay, the second dish.

998
00:55:00,350 --> 00:55:01,760
You can't stick out your tongue.

999
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:03,890
- No, you can't stick out your tongue.
- What was the clue you gave earlier?

1000
00:55:05,620 --> 00:55:07,060
Okay, no more.
What is your answer?

1001
00:55:08,180 --> 00:55:09,650
- Egg roll up.
- Egg roll up.

1002
00:55:09,650 --> 00:55:10,710
- Black beans.
- Black beans.

1003
00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:12,300
- Stir-fried dried squid.
- Stir-fried dried squid.

1004
00:55:13,120 --> 00:55:15,970
- Stir-fried dried squid?
- Stir-fried dried squid.

1005
00:55:15,970 --> 00:55:17,750
Stir-fried dried squid.

1006
00:55:17,750 --> 00:55:20,380
[Correct answer]

1007
00:55:24,250 --> 00:55:26,200
That's the same thing as stir-fried squid.

1008
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:28,200
Isn't that pretty much the same thing?

1009
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:35,880
[Their undeniable hunger.]

1010
00:55:45,630 --> 00:55:48,280
[Their frenzied grab for the food.]

1011
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:50,440
You know what my mom calls this?

1012
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:53,510
She always called this stir-fried squid.

1013
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:57,080
- She always called this stir-fried squid.
- Wait, I didn't get any rice.

1014
00:55:57,660 --> 00:55:59,340
I'm hungry!

1015
00:55:59,710 --> 00:56:04,250
Thus, the Green Team wins
the Food Battle Game.

1016
00:56:04,250 --> 00:56:07,190
[With three wins in a row, Ji Hyo's family
wins the five senses game!]

1017
00:56:07,190 --> 00:56:10,380
The winning team may step forward and
choose one of the boxes.

1018
00:56:10,380 --> 00:56:12,290
- You have to pick the top box now.
- Sure, they should.

1019
00:56:13,140 --> 00:56:15,150
It's your choice, Ah In.

1020
00:56:15,150 --> 00:56:17,160
- I want to go with this one.
- Then go with that one.

1021
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:18,610
Go with the one you want.

1022
00:56:18,730 --> 00:56:21,200
[Oh... going with the low box again?]

1023
00:56:22,450 --> 00:56:24,320
We get the top box again?

1024
00:56:25,110 --> 00:56:27,230
<i>[Have your ultimate taste buds
been brought back to life again?]</i>

1025
00:56:27,230 --> 00:56:30,580
<i>[Move onto the mural village.]</i>

1026
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:42,090
[Next mission location-
'B' village in Daegu.]

1027
00:56:44,340 --> 00:56:47,010
- Look at all that.
- That's beautiful.

1028
00:56:47,010 --> 00:56:51,820
[Everyone's astounded by the beauty
of this fairytale like village.]

1029
00:56:53,970 --> 00:56:57,170
<i>[I have made songpyeon for all of you
and hid it throughout the village.]</i>

1030
00:56:57,170 --> 00:57:00,100
<i>Either find the songpyeon yourselves,
or steal it from each other</i>

1031
00:57:00,100 --> 00:57:02,800
<i>and the first team to place ten in the
pot and put the lid on wins.</i>

1032
00:57:02,810 --> 00:57:07,170
[Find ten songpyeon and
place them in your own pot.]

1033
00:57:07,170 --> 00:57:10,520
There are two home zones that you will find
placed across the street from each other.

1034
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:13,430
You will find a huge pot
in your own home zone.

1035
00:57:13,860 --> 00:57:19,230
You will find that songpyeon has been
hidden throughout this village.

1036
00:57:19,230 --> 00:57:22,420
Each team has to find and place ten
of them in each of their own team's pots.

1037
00:57:22,430 --> 00:57:28,530
[First team to find them and place all ten
in the pot wins the game.]

1038
00:57:28,530 --> 00:57:31,060
Mom, you're going to see
a war break out.

1039
00:57:31,060 --> 00:57:33,920
That's what I'm predicting.
You'd better prepare yourself for this.

1040
00:57:33,930 --> 00:57:36,400
[Whatever it is that you're imagining,
it's going to be much worse than that.]

1041
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:38,330
Once it's in the pot, we can't
steal it from each other, right?

1042
00:57:38,330 --> 00:57:39,880
- No, of course not.
- You can steal from each other's pot?

1043
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:42,220
- There's no such thing.
- There are no rules in this game!

1044
00:57:43,420 --> 00:57:46,760
- Bite and tear if you have to. Fight!
- We have to cover this with our body.

1045
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:51,090
There aren't any lids for these pots.

1046
00:57:51,090 --> 00:57:54,550
[Must find the lids to cover the pots with
to keep their songpyeon safe.]

1047
00:57:54,560 --> 00:57:57,900
Since Kwang Soo is strong,
and he's good at cheating...

1048
00:57:57,900 --> 00:58:00,220
- He doesn't care about hitting or biting.
- He's good at stealing from others.

1049
00:58:00,820 --> 00:58:03,310
- They're going to be pretty large in size.
- Guys like Kwang Soo...

1050
00:58:03,310 --> 00:58:05,510
He won't care if it's you,
or anyone else for that matter.

1051
00:58:05,510 --> 00:58:06,830
He won't care if it's you.

1052
00:58:06,830 --> 00:58:09,090
No, it's because he hasn't seen
the real scary side of me yet.

1053
00:58:09,090 --> 00:58:11,140
- Then you can show him.
- I will.

1054
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:16,550
[Readying herself for battle.
Hae Sook's fearsome warning.]

1055
00:58:16,550 --> 00:58:18,220
Let's all get together and say 'fighting'.

1056
00:58:19,070 --> 00:58:20,930
- One, two, three.
- Fighting.

1057
00:58:21,940 --> 00:58:25,360
[Steal the songpyeon battle- Start!]

1058
00:58:26,250 --> 00:58:31,020
[Starting out to find their songpyeon first!]

1059
00:58:31,020 --> 00:58:32,740
Where could these songpyeons be?

1060
00:58:33,670 --> 00:58:35,260
Wow, this place is so pretty.

1061
00:58:35,260 --> 00:58:37,850
[With all the painted murals on the walls,
finding the songpyeon is even more difficult.]

1062
00:58:39,650 --> 00:58:41,350
That looks so delicious!

1063
00:58:41,350 --> 00:58:43,620
[Blank Ji coincidentally finds
a pot filled with real songpyeon!]

1064
00:58:43,620 --> 00:58:45,220
[Looks delicious.]

1065
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:47,900
Wow, you really have a big mouth.

1066
00:58:47,900 --> 00:58:50,240
Most women would eat it like this.

1067
00:58:51,610 --> 00:58:53,210
Wow, this village is huge.

1068
00:58:53,620 --> 00:58:55,730
Hello.
Do you have any songpyeon?

1069
00:58:55,730 --> 00:58:57,170
You have songpyeon up there, don't you?

1070
00:58:57,170 --> 00:58:59,190
[Interrogating one of the villagers.]

1071
00:58:59,190 --> 00:59:00,440
You have songpyeon up there, right?

1072
00:59:01,160 --> 00:59:03,820
[It's right here!]

1073
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:06,100
Have you seen any?

1074
00:59:12,230 --> 00:59:15,070
[Discovers a songpyeon exactly
where they instructed him that it would be.]

1075
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:19,340
Thank you!

1076
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:22,590
Hello.

1077
00:59:25,380 --> 00:59:28,090
[Ah In discovers his
second songpyeon already!]

1078
00:59:29,770 --> 00:59:31,650
There's another one.
I see another one over there.

1079
00:59:32,780 --> 00:59:36,510
[Without any hesitation,
he discovers his third songpyeon!]

1080
00:59:37,740 --> 00:59:38,800
I see another one over there!

1081
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:40,980
[Another one?]

1082
00:59:41,490 --> 00:59:42,970
- There are so many of them!
- You found one?

1083
00:59:42,970 --> 00:59:44,410
How many have you found?

1084
00:59:44,420 --> 00:59:46,110
- Three.
- You've already found three?

1085
00:59:46,110 --> 00:59:49,490
[Running around and
finding all of them on his own!]

1086
00:59:49,490 --> 00:59:51,940
[Ah In having discovered
four songpyeon all on his own!]

1087
00:59:51,940 --> 00:59:54,380
- Who's guarding the pot right now?
- There's no one there.

1088
00:59:55,450 --> 00:59:56,520
Ji Hyo!

1089
00:59:58,950 --> 01:00:01,820
[Jae Suk of Hae Sook's team
discovers one himself.]

1090
01:00:07,320 --> 01:00:09,110
I can't believe you guys hid one here.

1091
01:00:09,110 --> 01:00:11,950
[Finds another songpyeon immediately.]

1092
01:00:14,290 --> 01:00:15,670
Hey, Kwang Soo.

1093
01:00:17,770 --> 01:00:19,090
Jong Kook.

1094
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:22,330
Ah In.
Just stay right there for now.

1095
01:00:23,580 --> 01:00:26,930
[Bluffing each other as if
they have their own backup waiting.]

1096
01:00:26,940 --> 01:00:29,140
- Should we just go our own separate ways?
- Move.

1097
01:00:29,890 --> 01:00:31,360
- Goodbye, Sir.
- Okay.

1098
01:00:36,520 --> 01:00:37,650
Move.

1099
01:00:37,650 --> 01:00:40,230
Don't you think that I should
do something about this right now?

1100
01:00:40,230 --> 01:00:42,770
- Move.
- I need to do something for my team.

1101
01:00:42,770 --> 01:00:44,460
This is your role, so get out of the way.

1102
01:00:44,460 --> 01:00:47,140
You've already done enough.
You'll get a split second on screen for this.

1103
01:00:47,140 --> 01:00:48,340
Move.

1104
01:00:48,340 --> 01:00:51,380
- I'm going to take those from you.
- I don't think you'll be able to do that.

1105
01:00:56,270 --> 01:00:58,310
You've gotten much stronger, I see.

1106
01:00:59,270 --> 01:01:00,990
Aren't you even afraid of me?

1107
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:05,080
- Don't you find me the least bit threatening?
- No.

1108
01:01:05,080 --> 01:01:07,270
[You just wait and see...]

1109
01:01:08,630 --> 01:01:10,500
[Meanwhile...]

1110
01:01:13,620 --> 01:01:16,600
[Mother Hae Sook stuffing
her songpyeon under her shirt.]

1111
01:01:20,540 --> 01:01:23,960
[Disguising herself into a woman
who's had a little too much to eat at lunch.]

1112
01:01:26,580 --> 01:01:28,980
[Ah In is approaching in her direction.]

1113
01:01:28,980 --> 01:01:30,720
I wonder why this door is open.

1114
01:01:31,720 --> 01:01:33,100
I should go keep my songpyeon safe.

1115
01:01:34,100 --> 01:01:35,310
Mom.

1116
01:01:35,670 --> 01:01:37,770
- Why are you heading this way?
- Mom, is this songpyeon?

1117
01:01:37,770 --> 01:01:39,650
- Can I see?
- No, I wouldn't know.

1118
01:01:39,650 --> 01:01:40,650
Mom.

1119
01:01:40,650 --> 01:01:44,160
I already told you that I don't know,
so must you get so close to me?

1120
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:47,440
- Mom, let's take a little breather.
- You like salted crab, don't you?

1121
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:49,890
I even sent you two rice cakes, didn't I?

1122
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:53,300
Mom, I really want to work hard.
I want to be a son that you can be proud of!

1123
01:01:53,300 --> 01:01:56,050
I'm working very hard myself right now.

1124
01:01:56,050 --> 01:01:59,150
Ah In, must you really take the one
songpyeon that I found?

1125
01:01:59,160 --> 01:02:00,490
Mom.

1126
01:02:01,840 --> 01:02:03,140
Don't do this to me.

1127
01:02:03,150 --> 01:02:04,750
[Kwang Soo appears out of nowhere
and moves in on Hae Sook!]

1128
01:02:09,430 --> 01:02:11,900
[It's only a matter of time before she
gets her songpyeon taken away from her?]

1129
01:02:14,910 --> 01:02:17,590
[Big-nose coming to her rescue
after he heard her screaming out loud.]

1130
01:02:17,590 --> 01:02:20,170
- What do you think you're doing?
- Don't mind him.

1131
01:02:20,170 --> 01:02:22,060
- Are you seriously going to do this?
- What are you doing?

1132
01:02:22,070 --> 01:02:24,820
- Don't you think that you're being too much?
- You're the only one who came here to help?

1133
01:02:25,420 --> 01:02:27,600
[Just then, Jae Suk also shows up
to her rescue.]

1134
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:29,060
We were just passing through.

1135
01:02:30,690 --> 01:02:31,890
Take theirs away from them.

1136
01:02:33,370 --> 01:02:35,170
[Team Ji Hyo's Ha Ha
also runs over to their rescue.]

1137
01:02:36,620 --> 01:02:38,850
[Trying to take each other's
songpyeon away from them.]

1138
01:02:38,850 --> 01:02:41,440
[Total chaos]

1139
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:42,610
No!

1140
01:02:45,250 --> 01:02:47,390
[Ah In manages to steal one of
Jae Suk's songpyeon!]

1141
01:02:47,390 --> 01:02:50,290
[Ah In steals one of Jae Suk's songpyeon,
and runs for his life!]

1142
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:55,720
[Protecting their stash is definitely
much more difficult than finding them.]

1143
01:02:56,250 --> 01:02:59,020
[Hae Sook placing Giraffe,
the instigator under lockdown.]

1144
01:02:59,990 --> 01:03:01,830
Wait, they're gone.

1145
01:03:03,060 --> 01:03:05,890
[Mr. Capable shows up at the scene
a second too late.]

1146
01:03:07,300 --> 01:03:08,450
[The only way to survive is to escape.]

1147
01:03:08,450 --> 01:03:09,560
Ah In took one of mine.

1148
01:03:09,560 --> 01:03:11,640
- Come here, Lee Kwang Soo.
- Why did you let him take it away?

1149
01:03:11,640 --> 01:03:15,260
- Three of them came at me out of nowhere.
- Give it to me. I'll hold onto it.

1150
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:19,300
Hey! I don't think we'll be able to
take that one away from them.

1151
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:24,160
You come here.

1152
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:27,380
[Taking their easy prey Ha Ha with them?]

1153
01:03:27,380 --> 01:03:30,150
[It seems as though they want to
question him about something.]

1154
01:03:30,150 --> 01:03:32,070
- Get rid of Kwang Soo.
- We don't want you coming in here.

1155
01:03:32,570 --> 01:03:35,170
He's going to spill the beans
about where your home zone is.

1156
01:03:35,170 --> 01:03:36,360
So just be aware of that.

1157
01:03:36,810 --> 01:03:40,490
[Haroro being threatened
and tortured for answers.]

1158
01:03:41,420 --> 01:03:45,800
[Under torture, Haroro's loyalty goes...
right out the window.]

1159
01:03:45,800 --> 01:03:47,570
Kwang Soo's butt.

1160
01:03:47,570 --> 01:03:50,360
[Kwang Soo's butt?]

1161
01:03:51,330 --> 01:03:52,410
Come here.

1162
01:03:54,510 --> 01:03:56,900
[Ha Ha must've talked!]

1163
01:03:58,270 --> 01:04:01,250
[Examining his butt just
like their informant told them.]

1164
01:04:05,620 --> 01:04:09,160
[A humiliating scene for the Giraffe.]

1165
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:13,230
[Ah... how humiliating.]

1166
01:04:13,740 --> 01:04:16,080
- Just go away now.
- I gave you the information you wanted.

1167
01:04:16,090 --> 01:04:18,870
- Okay, you may go now.
- I hope you'll leave me alone now.

1168
01:04:19,850 --> 01:04:22,300
[How dare you even say that now!]

1169
01:04:23,970 --> 01:04:26,080
I couldn't stand the torture.

1170
01:04:26,490 --> 01:04:28,140
How was I supposed to
stand their torture?

1171
01:04:28,150 --> 01:04:30,210
They took my pants down
in front of all these people.

1172
01:04:30,210 --> 01:04:33,120
I knew that Kwang Soo's butt
wasn't that plush.

1173
01:04:34,690 --> 01:04:37,920
[Current songpyeon score-
Hae Sook- 3 : Ji Hyo- 4.]

1174
01:04:39,160 --> 01:04:42,130
<i>We have to be more careful with this.
Jae Suk saw it earlier.</i>

1175
01:04:42,130 --> 01:04:45,570
[Hae Sook secretly making her way
to the enemy camp's home zone.]

1176
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:52,410
[Heading into the room in front of
her opposing team's pot?]

1177
01:04:54,460 --> 01:04:58,390
[Convinced that their songpyeon are
hidden somewhere nearby.]

1178
01:04:58,400 --> 01:05:00,910
- They have to be in here somewhere.
- Hae Sook, what are you doing?

1179
01:05:00,910 --> 01:05:02,170
No, nothing.

1180
01:05:02,510 --> 01:05:04,200
What are you doing in our house?

1181
01:05:05,050 --> 01:05:07,070
- No, I was just checking things out.
- Isn't it nice and warm in here?

1182
01:05:07,070 --> 01:05:08,500
Yes, it's nice and warm.

1183
01:05:08,500 --> 01:05:10,380
- Where have you been?
- Excuse me?

1184
01:05:10,380 --> 01:05:12,290
I wasn't doing anything in here.

1185
01:05:13,210 --> 01:05:16,630
[Pretending like she just came in to
rest in the warm and cozy room.]

1186
01:05:19,270 --> 01:05:24,120
[Meanwhile, the rest of the men are focusing
more on stealing each other's songpyeon.]

1187
01:05:24,120 --> 01:05:25,640
These hyenas are back again.

1188
01:05:27,380 --> 01:05:29,320
[Mr. Capable's defense moves.]

1189
01:05:33,650 --> 01:05:35,350
Ah In, hurry up.
We can take his away from him.

1190
01:05:35,350 --> 01:05:37,050
[Having given up on finding the songpyeon,
they're focusing on stealing the songpyeon.]

1191
01:05:37,050 --> 01:05:38,540
No!

1192
01:05:39,770 --> 01:05:41,770
[Ah In succeeds in stealing
Jae Suk's songpyeon again!]

1193
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:52,080
[Who's hand will this songpyeon fall into?]

1194
01:05:54,700 --> 01:05:56,660
[That's our Ace!
Nice catch, Blank Ji!]

1195
01:05:57,090 --> 01:05:59,660
[The time is now!]

1196
01:06:03,850 --> 01:06:08,060
[Now's the chance! Hae Sook
searching every nook and cranny.]

1197
01:06:12,610 --> 01:06:15,060
[Hitting a very specific target.]

1198
01:06:16,340 --> 01:06:18,620
How could you hit me there so hard
from such a close proximity?

1199
01:06:19,550 --> 01:06:22,810
[Because he is Mr. Capable...
Maximum distance, maximum pain.]

1200
01:06:23,990 --> 01:06:25,510
Where?
Where did they hide them?

1201
01:06:27,460 --> 01:06:29,450
I found it!
I found it!

1202
01:06:30,140 --> 01:06:32,260
[Inside the washer?]

1203
01:06:33,150 --> 01:06:36,970
[Wow! Discovers three of her
opponent's hidden songpyeon!]

1204
01:06:37,650 --> 01:06:40,200
[Mother Hae Sook having pulled
more than her weight!]

1205
01:06:43,460 --> 01:06:45,700
- Are we all set after we take this one?
- No.

1206
01:06:46,420 --> 01:06:49,270
All of ours are gone.
Someone came and stole ours away.

1207
01:06:49,270 --> 01:06:50,640
Already?
They're gone already?

1208
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:52,550
Kwang Soo.

1209
01:06:53,960 --> 01:06:55,650
- Thanks.
- Huh?

1210
01:06:55,650 --> 01:06:59,220
- Why are you thanking me?
- Thanks for telling us about the washer.

1211
01:07:00,440 --> 01:07:02,800
[Framing him as a traitor.]

1212
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:05,590
[A character so easy to frame.]

1213
01:07:05,930 --> 01:07:07,730
I really didn't tell them anything.

1214
01:07:09,100 --> 01:07:10,840
It really wasn't me.

1215
01:07:11,240 --> 01:07:13,500
Hey! You're the only
one who could've done it.

1216
01:07:13,500 --> 01:07:14,990
You told them, didn't you?

1217
01:07:14,990 --> 01:07:16,330
- I didn't tell them anything.
- Kwang Soo's in trouble.

1218
01:07:16,330 --> 01:07:18,830
[Danger! Extremely angry
Blank Ji is approaching!]

1219
01:07:18,840 --> 01:07:20,340
- I didn't tell them anything.
- Hey!

1220
01:07:20,350 --> 01:07:22,220
How can you do this to
your own team?

1221
01:07:22,220 --> 01:07:24,340
- Huh?
- I'm seriously going to lose my mind.

1222
01:07:24,620 --> 01:07:27,710
Look at how my husband is over there
feeding the rabbits right now.

1223
01:07:27,710 --> 01:07:29,130
[Daddy Gary have lost it and
is busy feeding grass to the rabbits.]

1224
01:07:29,130 --> 01:07:31,180
I'm going to leave this godforsaken world.

1225
01:07:31,180 --> 01:07:34,430
Hubby, come over here.
This isn't the time to be doing that.

1226
01:07:34,440 --> 01:07:35,870
I'm going to live with these rabbits.

1227
01:07:37,010 --> 01:07:39,810
[Do you know what we went through
to get those songpyeons?]

1228
01:07:40,330 --> 01:07:42,260
- We were shocked ourselves.
- You know that it wasn't me, don't you?

1229
01:07:42,260 --> 01:07:47,340
[Ji Hyo's family is falling apart
at the seams.]

1230
01:07:47,340 --> 01:07:49,470
We never should've had him.

1231
01:07:49,470 --> 01:07:51,360
How can you say that?
How could you say such a thing?

1232
01:07:51,360 --> 01:07:53,990
[Father upset at the birth of
his second son?]

1233
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:57,530
Your father seems to be very upset right now,
so you should go take a walk on your own.

1234
01:07:57,530 --> 01:08:00,320
No! You're the one
who put me in this situation!

1235
01:08:00,320 --> 01:08:01,830
- Go take a walk and let him cool off.
- Dad!

1236
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:04,140
- Go take a walk, Kwang Soo.
- Dad!

1237
01:08:04,140 --> 01:08:06,060
Just go study abroad.

1238
01:08:06,340 --> 01:08:09,040
[How to take care of his problematic son?
Send him away to study abroad.]

1239
01:08:09,040 --> 01:08:10,970
- Just leave us.
- It really wasn't me.

1240
01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:16,190
The elders of this village have decided.
We've decided to banish you.

1241
01:08:17,850 --> 01:08:20,820
[Not only from his own home,
but he's banished from the whole town.]

1242
01:08:20,820 --> 01:08:22,890
A son like that will be our ruin.

1243
01:08:24,310 --> 01:08:27,690
[Ji Hyo's current songpyeon count- Eight.
Back to searching the village.]

1244
01:08:30,820 --> 01:08:32,460
There it is. Is that it?

1245
01:08:32,460 --> 01:08:33,630
I found one!

1246
01:08:34,470 --> 01:08:37,990
[A family full of ace players!
Ah In discovers another  songpyeon!]

1247
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:39,340
Hey, Ah In!

1248
01:08:39,340 --> 01:08:41,650
[Haroro immediately discovers
one for himself as well!]

1249
01:08:41,650 --> 01:08:43,350
Hey!
We've got them all.

1250
01:08:43,350 --> 01:08:46,760
[Ji Hyo's family all of a sudden
having gathered all ten that they need!]

1251
01:08:46,760 --> 01:08:48,080
We just need to get these
back to the pot.

1252
01:08:54,390 --> 01:08:55,820
[Songpyeon that can be seen
sneaking out of the bag.]

1253
01:08:55,820 --> 01:08:57,810
[Hae Sook sees it like a hawk,
and swoops down to snatch it!]

1254
01:09:00,320 --> 01:09:04,670
[Hae Sook getting in the way of
Ji Hyo's family's success!]

1255
01:09:06,440 --> 01:09:08,800
Stop filming and just run!

1256
01:09:12,400 --> 01:09:13,610
Hurry up and put it in there.

1257
01:09:15,900 --> 01:09:21,110
[Hae Sook and her boys getting out all
the songpyeons that they've kept hidden.]

1258
01:09:21,110 --> 01:09:23,040
- Here, put it in there.
- How many do we have so far?

1259
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:25,460
- How many is that?
- Two, four, six.

1260
01:09:25,460 --> 01:09:27,150
Put your three in there right now.

1261
01:09:27,150 --> 01:09:29,240
That makes it nine.
We need one more. Where's one more?

1262
01:09:29,240 --> 01:09:30,750
[There's six,
and add three more from Jong Kook's shirt!]

1263
01:09:30,750 --> 01:09:32,820
- Did you get it all in there? How many now?
- There are nine.

1264
01:09:32,820 --> 01:09:35,240
- Two, four, six, okay nine in here.
- We need one more.

1265
01:09:35,240 --> 01:09:38,250
[Jong Kook having hidden one away in his
VJ's bag from early on in the game.]

1266
01:09:39,910 --> 01:09:41,990
[They must be stopped!]

1267
01:09:43,160 --> 01:09:45,760
[Ah... gets the last one in the pot
by the split of a hair difference!]

1268
01:09:45,760 --> 01:09:48,360
[Arguing up to the very last moment.]

1269
01:09:49,150 --> 01:09:51,040
The have nine in there.
There are nine.

1270
01:09:51,040 --> 01:09:52,590
No, we have ten!

1271
01:09:55,050 --> 01:09:59,420
[Hae Sook's family succeeds in
gathering all ten songpyeon!]

1272
01:09:59,850 --> 01:10:01,140
[We were so close.]

1273
01:10:02,890 --> 01:10:07,290
[A total of ten with the addition of the last
songpyeon Hae Sook stole from Gary.]

1274
01:10:08,770 --> 01:10:12,760
[And again, the time has returned for
the winning team to pick the box.]

1275
01:10:14,290 --> 01:10:16,180
[Hae Sook's family chooses the low box.]

1276
01:10:16,220 --> 01:10:19,120
[Ji Hyo's family thus is given the top box.]

1277
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:32,190
[Time to shop for the final cook-off!]

1278
01:10:32,790 --> 01:10:36,810
[Hae Sook's family is the first to arrive.]

1279
01:10:38,850 --> 01:10:41,430
[And Ji Hyo's family soon arrives thereafter.]

1280
01:10:41,430 --> 01:10:43,550
- Okay, everyone has their boxes?
- Yes.

1281
01:10:43,550 --> 01:10:45,520
- It's time for you to open your boxes.
- Really?

1282
01:10:45,520 --> 01:10:48,010
[It's finally time to reveal what's in
the boxes that they've been carrying around.]

1283
01:10:48,010 --> 01:10:51,260
[Just what could be in those boxes?]

1284
01:10:51,260 --> 01:10:52,430
What's in here?

1285
01:10:53,750 --> 01:10:57,340
[Huh? A plastic bag?]

1286
01:11:00,290 --> 01:11:02,720
[The difference in those two boxes are
the difference in the size of their bags.]

1287
01:11:03,720 --> 01:11:07,890
- I bet the other one is bigger.
- This one is definitely bigger.

1288
01:11:07,890 --> 01:11:11,440
[The plastic bags from the 'top' boxes are
much bigger to put more things in.]

1289
01:11:12,150 --> 01:11:14,890
We won't allow you to use any
ingredients that you carry in your hands.

1290
01:11:14,890 --> 01:11:16,060
Yes, I understand.

1291
01:11:16,060 --> 01:11:18,100
You have 100 seconds from now on.

1292
01:11:18,100 --> 01:11:20,040
[Their allotted time to shop- 100 seconds.]

1293
01:11:20,040 --> 01:11:23,520
[They don't even know what they're cooking,
but they're off to shop!]

1294
01:11:23,870 --> 01:11:25,340
Let's make braised ribs.

1295
01:11:25,340 --> 01:11:27,210
- What should we make?
- What are we making?

1296
01:11:27,970 --> 01:11:30,710
- What should we make?
- How about kimchi?

1297
01:11:30,710 --> 01:11:32,790
- Kimchi?
- What are we buying?

1298
01:11:32,790 --> 01:11:36,030
[Have to decide what to make,
and get the ingredients for it...]

1299
01:11:36,030 --> 01:11:38,700
Kimchi!
Let's make kimchi and rice cake soup.

1300
01:11:38,700 --> 01:11:40,600
What am I supposed to do here?

1301
01:11:41,610 --> 01:11:43,590
- What are we going to make?
- I don't know what I'm getting.

1302
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:46,690
[Grabbing whatever they find
into their plastic bags.]

1303
01:11:46,690 --> 01:11:47,920
What are we making?

1304
01:11:49,050 --> 01:11:50,670
What are we making!

1305
01:11:50,670 --> 01:11:53,320
Ribs.
Give us meat to make braised ribs.

1306
01:11:53,320 --> 01:11:54,820
- You're making braised ribs?
- Meat to make braised ribs.

1307
01:11:54,820 --> 01:11:56,510
[It seems as though Ji Hyo's family
is leaning towards making braised ribs?]

1308
01:11:56,520 --> 01:11:59,050
- We need to get cooking oil!
- I got the cooking oil!

1309
01:11:59,490 --> 01:12:01,250
- Sesame oil!
- Grab the sesame oil!

1310
01:12:01,250 --> 01:12:02,600
[Sesame oil is also a given.]

1311
01:12:03,230 --> 01:12:04,710
- Did you get the meat?
- What else do we need?

1312
01:12:04,710 --> 01:12:05,820
We need some seasoning.

1313
01:12:05,820 --> 01:12:08,950
We need rice cakes for the rice cake soup.

1314
01:12:08,950 --> 01:12:11,160
[Mother Hae Sook is going to go with
the rice cake soup and kimchi?]

1315
01:12:12,010 --> 01:12:14,000
- We need eggs.
- What are we making?

1316
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:15,390
I don't know.
I was just told to get the eggs.

1317
01:12:15,390 --> 01:12:16,820
What are we making?

1318
01:12:16,820 --> 01:12:18,900
We need to get kimchi!

1319
01:12:18,900 --> 01:12:20,740
- Here it is.
- No, we need to well fermented one.

1320
01:12:20,740 --> 01:12:22,300
Just take one of each.

1321
01:12:22,300 --> 01:12:23,980
Just put them all in the bag.

1322
01:12:25,400 --> 01:12:28,080
[Ah In, the confident cook,
goes off to grab all the seasoning he needs.]

1323
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:29,260
Black pepper!

1324
01:12:29,260 --> 01:12:32,380
[Grabbing up all the necessary
ingredients that he can think of.]

1325
01:12:32,380 --> 01:12:33,360
Salt!

1326
01:12:33,360 --> 01:12:34,930
Just grab whatever!

1327
01:12:36,940 --> 01:12:39,280
I'm sorry, but we're in a huge rush!
You need to hurry!

1328
01:12:39,280 --> 01:12:41,070
[Trying to get the lady to slice up
the ribs at top speed.]

1329
01:12:41,070 --> 01:12:43,150
You don't have to cut it so neatly!

1330
01:12:44,060 --> 01:12:45,990
60 seconds have passed!

1331
01:12:47,580 --> 01:12:49,480
I'm getting the rib meat right now.
Thank you.

1332
01:12:51,360 --> 01:12:53,800
- 30 seconds left on the clock!
- Onions!

1333
01:12:53,800 --> 01:12:55,570
You have to get the seasoning!

1334
01:13:00,900 --> 01:13:04,260
I have no idea what I'm buying.
We don't even know what we're cooking yet.

1335
01:13:04,600 --> 01:13:06,150
Come here, Kwang Soo!

1336
01:13:06,150 --> 01:13:08,050
20 seconds left on the clock!

1337
01:13:08,050 --> 01:13:09,720
Here, put it in here!

1338
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:12,250
- We can't fit any more in here.
- Yes, we can fit it.

1339
01:13:29,570 --> 01:13:31,080
Three!

1340
01:13:31,690 --> 01:13:33,130
Two!

1341
01:13:33,760 --> 01:13:36,030
One!
Time's up!

1342
01:13:36,030 --> 01:13:37,490
[Shopping time is over!]

1343
01:13:37,490 --> 01:13:38,970
- Stop!
- Stop.

1344
01:13:39,610 --> 01:13:41,960
[Having stuffed the bag as much as he could.]

1345
01:13:41,960 --> 01:13:44,630
[Did they even get what they needed?]

1346
01:13:45,310 --> 01:13:48,880
- Why did you get those things?
- Because I had no idea what we needed.

1347
01:13:49,180 --> 01:13:52,390
[Hae Sook's family having grabbed whatever
they saw from not knowing what their dish is.]

1348
01:13:53,960 --> 01:13:57,260
[But they realized that they haven't
picked up any seasonings that they need.]

1349
01:13:57,260 --> 01:13:59,850
- All we did was grab a lot of kimchi.
- Why are there so many bags of kimchi?

1350
01:13:59,850 --> 01:14:01,080
[They were so intent on their dish that
all they grabbed were seven bags of kimchi.]

1351
01:14:01,080 --> 01:14:04,170
[What to do...]

1352
01:14:04,170 --> 01:14:05,250
Why did you grab this?

1353
01:14:05,250 --> 01:14:08,310
[Who put the razor blades in there?]

1354
01:14:10,810 --> 01:14:13,090
[He tried to sneak his own
personal shopping item in there?]

1355
01:14:13,090 --> 01:14:14,440
Leave that one out.

1356
01:14:15,140 --> 01:14:18,210
[Will they be able to make
braised ribs with these ingredients?]

1357
01:14:18,220 --> 01:14:20,060
- Thank you.
- Have a great day.

1358
01:14:20,060 --> 01:14:21,750
- Thank you.
- Let's go.

1359
01:14:21,750 --> 01:14:24,310
[After having completed their shopping,
they're now off to cook!]

1360
01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:30,090
[Thank you all for coming out
to cheer us on.]

1361
01:14:31,960 --> 01:14:35,160
[Off to their final destination with
their cars stocked with food!]

1362
01:14:39,780 --> 01:14:42,680
[Final location-
Daegu's traditional village.]

1363
01:14:42,680 --> 01:14:49,510
[The largest collection of traditional
residential homes in the city of Daegu.]

1364
01:14:49,510 --> 01:14:52,840
[The ultimate final cooking competition
is about to take place here...]

1365
01:14:53,740 --> 01:14:55,010
This way?

1366
01:14:55,010 --> 01:14:57,860
I'm so jealous of their big bags.

1367
01:14:58,730 --> 01:15:04,450
Now, with all the ingredients that you
bought in the 100 seconds that you were given

1368
01:15:04,450 --> 01:15:07,800
you have to complete your dish
in exactly one hour or less.

1369
01:15:08,460 --> 01:15:11,360
You have to stop your cooking
once your one hour is up

1370
01:15:11,360 --> 01:15:14,070
and you will have to submit your dish
for judging in the state it's in.

1371
01:15:14,070 --> 01:15:16,820
- Yes, we understand.
- You have exactly one hour.

1372
01:15:16,820 --> 01:15:19,410
One hour is all the time you have to cook.
Ready, set, go!

1373
01:15:19,410 --> 01:15:22,290
[Allotted time to cook- One hour.
Time to start cooking!]

1374
01:15:23,710 --> 01:15:26,360
[Having the final discussion to decide
what dish it is that they should cook.]

1375
01:15:26,360 --> 01:15:28,080
We can make kimchi rice cake soup.

1376
01:15:28,080 --> 01:15:29,470
Yes, we only need to make two dishes.

1377
01:15:29,470 --> 01:15:33,020
[Team Hae Sook's menu- Kimchi rice cake soup
with braised kimchi and chicken.]

1378
01:15:33,020 --> 01:15:35,200
Let's make those two dishes,
and submit the one that tastes better.

1379
01:15:36,050 --> 01:15:39,770
[Team Ji Hyo's preparations for
braised ribs are getting well under way.]

1380
01:15:43,230 --> 01:15:50,160
[Everything's going very smoothly
under Ah In's instructions.]

1381
01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:52,800
- Ah In.
- Yes?

1382
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:54,870
Do I need to clean these abalones
with a toothbrush?

1383
01:15:55,310 --> 01:15:58,560
You don't really need a toothbrush.
Scrub their shells against each other.

1384
01:15:58,570 --> 01:16:01,430
He's a total chef over here.
Do you hear him talking over here?

1385
01:16:01,430 --> 01:16:03,290
[A new side to him we never knew!
Ah In cooks like a chef!]

1386
01:16:03,290 --> 01:16:07,960
We are going to cook a dish that embodies
the elements of the sky, earth and the ocean.

1387
01:16:07,960 --> 01:16:10,410
[A dish that embodies the sky,
the ocean and the earth?]

1388
01:16:11,550 --> 01:16:12,940
You're surprised to hear that, aren't you?

1389
01:16:13,480 --> 01:16:16,240
[Meanwhile, Hae Sook and her boys
are the embodiment of relaxation.]

1390
01:16:16,900 --> 01:16:19,150
Yes, just put all that in there.

1391
01:16:19,150 --> 01:16:20,800
[Kimchi]

1392
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:23,620
[And more kimchi...]

1393
01:16:23,620 --> 01:16:25,690
[We know it's kimchi rice cake soup,
but that much kimchi?]

1394
01:16:25,690 --> 01:16:27,130
It's really good that way.

1395
01:16:28,180 --> 01:16:31,460
[And even more kimchi...]

1396
01:16:31,850 --> 01:16:34,540
- Don't you think that's way too much?
- No, it tastes better this way.

1397
01:16:34,540 --> 01:16:36,670
- Really?
- And later on when this boils...

1398
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:43,310
[With that laughter,
her credibility goes out the window...]

1399
01:16:43,310 --> 01:16:46,380
[Half water, and half kimchi.]

1400
01:16:46,750 --> 01:16:48,690
- Just trust me for now.
- Yes, sure.

1401
01:16:49,660 --> 01:16:51,800
- Mother, would you like for me to do it?
- No, it's okay.

1402
01:16:51,800 --> 01:16:54,190
[Now it's time to cut up the chicken,
just like the way she cut up all the kimchi.]

1403
01:16:55,320 --> 01:16:58,740
You have put some knife marks on it
for the seasoning to soak in.

1404
01:17:00,390 --> 01:17:02,460
Have you noticed how our mother
is really good at improvisation?

1405
01:17:02,460 --> 01:17:04,730
When she missed her mark with the knife...

1406
01:17:04,730 --> 01:17:07,920
[After she missed with her mark,
she just states that she meant to do that...]

1407
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:11,520
Because what I saw was her missing
the mark and cutting into the chicken wrong.

1408
01:17:11,520 --> 01:17:14,130
That's when she said it's good to
put some knife marks on the chicken.

1409
01:17:14,480 --> 01:17:16,960
- You didn't mean to do that initially.
- You didn't, did you?

1410
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:19,910
I don't think any of you are my sons.
None of you are helping me out.

1411
01:17:19,910 --> 01:17:22,470
- Mom, do you want some help?
- It's just that we know you, don't we?

1412
01:17:22,830 --> 01:17:24,850
[Ji Hyo's family are busy preparing all
the vegetables for their braised rib dish.]

1413
01:17:24,850 --> 01:17:26,490
Honey, how about spicy?

1414
01:17:26,490 --> 01:17:28,570
- How about spicy?
- What about spicy?

1415
01:17:28,570 --> 01:17:30,430
We're trying to decide whether we should
make it spicy or soy sauce based.

1416
01:17:30,430 --> 01:17:33,240
- Spicy. Let's go with the spicy version.
- Okay, spicy.

1417
01:17:36,930 --> 01:17:38,720
It's hard, isn't it?

1418
01:17:39,270 --> 01:17:41,820
[Oh my goodness...]

1419
01:17:41,820 --> 01:17:44,150
Why isn't this knife working?

1420
01:17:44,150 --> 01:17:45,970
[Monday married couple seeming to
have a very good and happy marriage.]

1421
01:17:46,290 --> 01:17:48,750
Today is our mom and dad's
wedding anniversary.

1422
01:17:49,940 --> 01:17:51,330
No, I'm serious.

1423
01:17:51,880 --> 01:17:54,810
And they said it's possible that they might
conceive another child tonight.

1424
01:17:54,810 --> 01:17:56,570
Don't say things like that out loud!

1425
01:17:58,010 --> 01:17:59,660
We're such a happy family.

1426
01:17:59,660 --> 01:18:01,420
I don't want any of you
to come home tonight.

1427
01:18:02,270 --> 01:18:04,610
Yes, Dad! We won't
come home until late tonight.

1428
01:18:04,620 --> 01:18:06,330
Staying out late is how you can be
filial to us.

1429
01:18:06,330 --> 01:18:10,030
Our dad's dream is to become
a long distance daddy.

1430
01:18:10,610 --> 01:18:12,340
[Long distance daddy.]

1431
01:18:12,340 --> 01:18:14,200
[I can't believe him.]

1432
01:18:14,790 --> 01:18:17,270
Take the kids and go to America
once the winter starts.

1433
01:18:19,950 --> 01:18:23,720
- Wow, look at what they've got over here.
- It's total chaos over here.

1434
01:18:23,720 --> 01:18:27,450
- This pot smells like alcohol.
- What are you cooking?

1435
01:18:27,450 --> 01:18:32,550
[It's just your basic
spicy braised rib, chicken, and abalone.]

1436
01:18:32,550 --> 01:18:34,980
- They already told us.
- It's because...

1437
01:18:34,980 --> 01:18:38,650
Ah In lived in Daegu for a long time when he
was little and he's used to the cooking here.

1438
01:18:38,650 --> 01:18:41,560
And Ah In has decided...

1439
01:18:41,940 --> 01:18:45,290
- That's why I decided to make this dish.
- Yes, that's right.

1440
01:18:46,280 --> 01:18:48,970
- But...
- But why are you adding chicken to it?

1441
01:18:48,970 --> 01:18:51,160
- That's what I'm asking.
- That's why, the bird from the sky...

1442
01:18:51,160 --> 01:18:53,050
abalone from the ocean...

1443
01:18:53,050 --> 01:18:56,400
- and the cow from the earth...
- From the earth.

1444
01:18:56,850 --> 01:19:00,390
That's why...
we refer to ourselves as the Triad.

1445
01:19:00,390 --> 01:19:03,710
[So that's why this is the Triad?]

1446
01:19:03,710 --> 01:19:07,580
You don't have to keep skimming that.
We're going to have to rinse it anyhow.

1447
01:19:08,540 --> 01:19:10,520
[You should've told me that sooner.]

1448
01:19:10,520 --> 01:19:12,340
You don't have to do all that work.

1449
01:19:17,690 --> 01:19:19,260
Am I not the second born son?

1450
01:19:20,020 --> 01:19:22,640
I feel like for some reason
that you seem more like our servant.

1451
01:19:22,640 --> 01:19:24,620
[He appears more to be their servant
rather than their second born son.]

1452
01:19:24,620 --> 01:19:25,970
- Son.
- Yes?

1453
01:19:25,970 --> 01:19:30,190
- I'm going to go get something to drink.
- Sure, go ahead.

1454
01:19:30,190 --> 01:19:32,570
- Keep an eye on the pot while I'm gone.
- Sure, see you in a bit.

1455
01:19:32,570 --> 01:19:33,990
We'll see you soon.

1456
01:19:35,980 --> 01:19:37,720
But you know what?

1457
01:19:38,330 --> 01:19:40,950
- Don't you think we need some onion in here?
- It's not just that.

1458
01:19:40,950 --> 01:19:43,310
I can say this now that she's gone.
But there's way too much kimchi in here.

1459
01:19:43,310 --> 01:19:45,600
- All it is, is kimchi.
- She put way too much in there.

1460
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:49,390
But you know what?
That soup does need a lot of kimchi.

1461
01:19:49,390 --> 01:19:52,320
- We need a lot of kimchi in that soup.
- I can understand that we need a lot.

1462
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:56,280
[Will all this kimchi be enough
to season the soup's flavor?]

1463
01:19:58,440 --> 01:20:02,910
[Meanwhile, Chef Ah In is confidently
whipping up the sauce for his dish.]

1464
01:20:03,540 --> 01:20:06,140
[Adding in the garlic, soy sauce
and the hot pepper paste.]

1465
01:20:06,140 --> 01:20:12,350
[With other seasonings and grain syrup
to give it extra flavor...]

1466
01:20:18,320 --> 01:20:20,350
[Yummy]

1467
01:20:22,150 --> 01:20:25,150
[Using the traditional way to eliminate
the order and rinsing all the meat.]

1468
01:20:25,160 --> 01:20:27,230
Are you not adding any water in there?

1469
01:20:28,020 --> 01:20:30,480
I'm going to add that in after I
saute this first for a little bit.

1470
01:20:30,480 --> 01:20:31,870
[Saute, then braise with the vegetables,
and it's all done!]

1471
01:20:31,870 --> 01:20:34,560
That looks really good.

1472
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:36,670
- Yes, I think it'll be fine.
- You think?

1473
01:20:36,670 --> 01:20:42,630
[Hot blooded youth Ah In is transformed into
an honorable chef in the kitchen.]

1474
01:20:43,230 --> 01:20:44,640
[And this guy...]

1475
01:20:44,640 --> 01:20:47,350
[What is he doing?]

1476
01:20:49,780 --> 01:20:51,970
Hey!
What are you doing!

1477
01:20:51,970 --> 01:20:54,010
Why are you cutting that pear
with a pair of scissors?

1478
01:20:54,010 --> 01:20:56,000
I have to puree this pear.

1479
01:20:57,260 --> 01:20:58,340
I couldn't find any knives.

1480
01:21:00,720 --> 01:21:02,840
We never should've had you!

1481
01:21:04,610 --> 01:21:06,860
Do you know how hurtful it is
to hear you say that?

1482
01:21:09,790 --> 01:21:11,680
Oh my, it's almost done.

1483
01:21:14,220 --> 01:21:15,750
[And this guy is still...]

1484
01:21:15,750 --> 01:21:18,550
- How is that going?
- Kwang Soo.

1485
01:21:18,550 --> 01:21:20,060
Go wash the carrots.

1486
01:21:21,360 --> 01:21:25,190
- Why are you talking to me that way?
- Didn't you used to sing too?

1487
01:21:25,190 --> 01:21:27,750
Here, think of this as your mike,
and go take this with you and wash it.

1488
01:21:27,750 --> 01:21:30,170
Your son is in the middle of
doing something.

1489
01:21:31,920 --> 01:21:33,940
Look, he's like Edward Scissors hands.

1490
01:21:33,940 --> 01:21:36,800
- What are you doing?
- I have to puree this for the dish.

1491
01:21:38,910 --> 01:21:41,890
Every little thing that you do
irritates the heck out of me.

1492
01:21:41,890 --> 01:21:43,090
Dad!

1493
01:21:43,100 --> 01:21:45,810
- Ugh, seriously.
- Just what do I mean to this family?

1494
01:21:47,050 --> 01:21:51,200
- Dad, tell him the truth.
- I just can't stand the sight of you.

1495
01:21:51,200 --> 01:21:55,770
[Dad... why do you keep treating
me this way?]

1496
01:21:55,770 --> 01:21:57,730
Do you think that I'll leave this family
just because you treat me that way?

1497
01:21:57,730 --> 01:21:59,470
[Pain in the butt son.]

1498
01:22:00,370 --> 01:22:04,430
[Next week... A dreamlike story that
the Giraffe will experience.]

1499
01:22:05,560 --> 01:22:09,290
Dad, where are you?
Don't open the door for anyone!

1500
01:22:10,030 --> 01:22:13,180
[The Giraffe will get to
meet his real father!]

1501
01:22:13,180 --> 01:22:15,790
It's him! He's the
one who always torments me!

1502
01:22:15,790 --> 01:22:17,380
It's this guy!

1503
01:22:17,380 --> 01:22:19,830
He's the guy!
Dad!

1504
01:22:20,910 --> 01:22:26,640
[Somehow... now only
20 minutes remains on the clock.]

1505
01:22:27,710 --> 01:22:30,480
[Huh? Why is she taking out all the broth?]

1506
01:22:30,820 --> 01:22:33,120
- It won't come to a boil.
- Why are you taking out the broth?

1507
01:22:33,120 --> 01:22:35,420
It won't come to a boil.
We need for it to come to a boil.

1508
01:22:35,420 --> 01:22:37,300
- That's going to start boiling soon.
- Really?

1509
01:22:37,300 --> 01:22:39,010
Then put it back in?

1510
01:22:40,190 --> 01:22:42,930
Mother, what about what you said
to us about putting our trust in you?

1511
01:22:42,940 --> 01:22:46,050
Mom, what's wrong with you?
This is your first time making it, right?

1512
01:22:46,050 --> 01:22:47,320
No, that's not it.

1513
01:22:47,320 --> 01:22:49,620
It's just that this kitchen
is an unfamiliar one to me.

1514
01:22:50,250 --> 01:22:55,880
You've been the eldest daughter of
this whole family for the past few decades.

1515
01:22:55,880 --> 01:23:00,240
I have tried to use all my cooking know-hows
of the past 50 years into this dish.

1516
01:23:04,120 --> 01:23:07,260
- This really makes it feel like a holiday.
- It's finally boiling.

1517
01:23:07,260 --> 01:23:08,700
Mom, what is this?

1518
01:23:09,990 --> 01:23:12,370
[This golden colored powder...]

1519
01:23:12,380 --> 01:23:16,190
[All that powder that can be seen
piled up on the ladle is...]

1520
01:23:16,530 --> 01:23:19,820
[It can't be powdered beans, nor sugar...]

1521
01:23:19,820 --> 01:23:21,530
What is all that powder?

1522
01:23:21,530 --> 01:23:23,120
Aunt, what are you doing?

1523
01:23:23,120 --> 01:23:26,290
[Continues not to tell them anything...]

1524
01:23:26,290 --> 01:23:29,570
[And secretly adds the powder into
the boiling soup broth.]

1525
01:23:31,250 --> 01:23:32,960
Seasoning?

1526
01:23:33,460 --> 01:23:37,960
No, this is definitely not MSG seasoning.
It's a special ingredient I brought from home.

1527
01:23:37,960 --> 01:23:40,470
- You brought that from home?
- Yes, I did.

1528
01:23:40,480 --> 01:23:44,610
[The kimchi broth with the special powder...
will it taste like anything now?]

1529
01:23:47,130 --> 01:23:49,490
- Should I add in the vegetables now?
- Add it in there!

1530
01:23:49,490 --> 01:23:52,660
[Ji Hyo's family finally adds in
all the vegetables.]

1531
01:23:52,660 --> 01:23:54,900
- Wow... look at that.
- Don't you think that's too much?

1532
01:23:54,900 --> 01:23:57,620
- There's not enough sauce for it.
- That's too much vegetables.

1533
01:23:57,620 --> 01:23:59,660
Who chopped this radish?

1534
01:23:59,660 --> 01:24:01,530
- Who chopped this radish?
- Kang Gary.

1535
01:24:01,530 --> 01:24:05,230
- Dad, what is this?
- That is one thing that I'm not good at.

1536
01:24:05,230 --> 01:24:08,920
- Should we take some out?
- No, it should be okay.

1537
01:24:08,930 --> 01:24:11,070
[Adding in the rest of the sauce
that Ah In made without sparing any.]

1538
01:24:11,550 --> 01:24:14,420
[Hae Sook and her sons are trying to
taste the dish to see how it is.]

1539
01:24:15,790 --> 01:24:18,480
It's lacking something,
but I can't put my finger on what it is.

1540
01:24:18,480 --> 01:24:21,000
- Then let's add more kimchi in the soup.
- The soup doesn't need any more kimchi.

1541
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:22,450
[More kimchi?]

1542
01:24:23,420 --> 01:24:25,840
Mom, just use a pair of scissors to cut it.

1543
01:24:25,840 --> 01:24:27,460
Just use scissors.

1544
01:24:27,460 --> 01:24:29,870
- Use scissors to cut it.
- You have to stop putting in all that kimchi.

1545
01:24:30,410 --> 01:24:33,200
[She put all seven bags
of kimchi in her soup!]

1546
01:24:33,200 --> 01:24:35,490
[Her special powder or whatever
is added to the soup some more.]

1547
01:24:36,340 --> 01:24:41,140
We should've made a smaller batch of this.
This is too much soup.

1548
01:24:41,140 --> 01:24:45,060
I can't figure out how to season it because
we're making such a huge batch of it.

1549
01:24:45,060 --> 01:24:47,680
I'm only used to making
family sized portions at home.

1550
01:24:47,680 --> 01:24:51,090
I told you earlier that we put
too much water in the pot.

1551
01:24:52,800 --> 01:24:55,520
- We gave you some of our ingredients.
- Thank you.

1552
01:24:55,520 --> 01:24:58,240
We can't put that in here.
No, we can't.

1553
01:24:58,540 --> 01:25:00,820
Jae Suk, we can't put
stuff like that in the soup.

1554
01:25:00,820 --> 01:25:02,940
- No, you can't.
- What are you trying to put in there?

1555
01:25:02,940 --> 01:25:04,260
- It's really lacking something in taste.
- No way, you can't put that in the soup.

1556
01:25:04,260 --> 01:25:05,910
Then put that in here.

1557
01:25:06,030 --> 01:25:09,410
[Just then, Hae Sook and her boys
add in all the rice cakes.]

1558
01:25:09,910 --> 01:25:13,450
- You did need a lot of kimchi in there.
- See? You do need a lot in the soup.

1559
01:25:13,450 --> 01:25:15,330
It looks really good
with all that kimchi in there.

1560
01:25:15,330 --> 01:25:18,600
Aren't you the youngest of all of us?
So why are you just sitting there talking?

1561
01:25:18,930 --> 01:25:22,770
- Why aren't you even doing anything?
- I'm arranging things around here.

1562
01:25:22,770 --> 01:25:25,210
Why would you be arranging anything?

1563
01:25:25,220 --> 01:25:28,190
- I'm making sure that everything goes well.
- Why are you the one to be doing that?

1564
01:25:29,310 --> 01:25:32,590
- Seriously... you're such a brat.
- Why did you raise him to be such a brat?

1565
01:25:32,590 --> 01:25:34,340
- I'm sorry. I shouldn't have.
- He has no respects for his elders.

1566
01:25:34,340 --> 01:25:37,360
I think I breastfed him for way too long.

1567
01:25:37,730 --> 01:25:40,850
- I just focused too much on him.
- You gave him too much of your attention.

1568
01:25:40,850 --> 01:25:42,880
You've always been very good to me, Mom.

1569
01:25:42,880 --> 01:25:44,830
How's it going with that soup?

1570
01:25:45,410 --> 01:25:48,340
- Is it boiling?
- Do I look like a reporter to you?

1571
01:25:49,020 --> 01:25:52,560
- Do I look like your beck and call boy?
- I was just asking you a question.

1572
01:25:52,560 --> 01:25:55,530
We're not over hanging out at
Kim Hae Sook's house right now.

1573
01:25:55,840 --> 01:25:57,730
This is our home, and this is our mom.

1574
01:25:57,730 --> 01:26:01,080
[Don't talk to him like you're on a set.]

1575
01:26:01,080 --> 01:26:02,840
I just wanted to know what
kind of a situation we were in.

1576
01:26:02,840 --> 01:26:06,290
Now... you've only got
ten minutes left on the clock.

1577
01:26:06,290 --> 01:26:08,770
We have to let it simmer some more so that
the rice cake cooks all the way through.

1578
01:26:08,770 --> 01:26:10,050
It's almost done now.

1579
01:26:10,050 --> 01:26:13,150
We just need to add the glass noodles to it,
and let that cook through.

1580
01:26:14,670 --> 01:26:16,260
- Let's see.
- Let it simmer some more.

1581
01:26:17,170 --> 01:26:20,190
[All the members of Ji Hyo's family
getting a taste of the dish.]

1582
01:26:20,190 --> 01:26:22,100
- It's good.
- All the meat is cooked through.

1583
01:26:25,840 --> 01:26:29,230
[The delicious looking triad of
the braised dish is now complete!]

1584
01:26:29,640 --> 01:26:33,000
That soup is finally starting to
bubble and boil.

1585
01:26:35,060 --> 01:26:38,510
You were so worried that it wasn't boiling,
but look at how it's bubbling over now.

1586
01:26:39,400 --> 01:26:41,210
- What is that on top? Eggs?
- Yeah.

1587
01:26:41,780 --> 01:26:44,100
Aren't kimchi soups supposed to have
that clean and crisp taste?

1588
01:26:44,100 --> 01:26:48,270
But adding some eggs as a topper
could really deepen the taste.

1589
01:26:50,160 --> 01:26:54,060
[Ji Hyo and her family adds in the abalone
for the sea element to complete the dish.]

1590
01:26:54,060 --> 01:26:55,800
Did Ah In do all the cooking?

1591
01:26:55,800 --> 01:26:59,290
- No, we all did it together.
- Look at that.

1592
01:26:59,290 --> 01:27:03,250
[Add in the final touches... and voila!]

1593
01:27:04,920 --> 01:27:08,400
[At last, both teams' dishes are complete!]

1594
01:27:08,960 --> 01:27:11,870
[Judgment time!]

1595
01:27:11,870 --> 01:27:13,880
Please place your dish on the table
that you see in front of you.

1596
01:27:13,890 --> 01:27:17,410
Madame go Dong Wan would like to
say something to all of you herself.

1597
01:27:19,780 --> 01:27:21,250
That's our rich grandmother.

1598
01:27:21,250 --> 01:27:24,620
You all worked very hard to create your dish.

1599
01:27:24,900 --> 01:27:30,030
If any of you utter even a single word
about who made what dish...

1600
01:27:30,070 --> 01:27:32,460
I'm going to flip that table over
and dump everything onto the ground.

1601
01:27:33,180 --> 01:27:35,700
You have to let it go because
she's our rich grandmother.

1602
01:27:37,320 --> 01:27:38,820
Thank you everyone for
your hard work.

1603
01:27:38,830 --> 01:27:41,470
These dishes that all of you
