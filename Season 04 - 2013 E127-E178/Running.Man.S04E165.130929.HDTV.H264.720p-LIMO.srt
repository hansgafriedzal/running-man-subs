00:00:01,089 --> 00:00:03,796
[One fine day...]

2
00:00:03,797 --> 00:00:08,382
[A young girl comes up to the writer.]

3
00:00:08,383 --> 00:00:14,011
[And shyly hands over a fan letter
full of her love and encouragement.]

4
00:00:14,012 --> 00:00:18,887
[Running Man will run today
for the love of that young fan girl.]

5
00:00:18,888 --> 00:00:26,048
[An emotional surprise race they'll be
running for that one fan girl alone.]

6
00:00:26,049 --> 00:00:31,275
[Find the young fan girl!]

7
00:00:32,186 --> 00:00:34,530
[A gas station in Namyang- 7:30 a.m.]

8
00:00:35,504 --> 00:00:39,572
[Who could it be?
A car is seen rolling up to the gas station.]

9
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:43,559
Hello.

10
00:00:43,963 --> 00:00:46,056
- Hello.
- Hello.

11
00:00:46,057 --> 00:00:48,587
- Here's your mission.
- Thank you.

12
00:00:48,588 --> 00:00:52,264
[Hands over a mission.]

13
00:00:52,794 --> 00:00:55,149
<i>Today's mission.
Running Man's sign photo booth.</i>

14
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:57,447
<i>Pass the mission by handing out
30 of your own signatures.</i>

15
00:00:57,818 --> 00:01:00,198
Pass the mission by handing out
30 of your own signatures?

16
00:01:01,037 --> 00:01:04,993
If you look in front of you,
you'll see a picture sticker photo booth.

17
00:01:04,994 --> 00:01:08,862
Inside, you'll find seven buttons
with all the members' pictures and names.

18
00:01:09,727 --> 00:01:15,275
- Once the fans walk into the booth...
- So it's all about who's button they press?

19
00:01:15,276 --> 00:01:17,041
The first person who gets
30 selections passes the mission?

20
00:01:17,042 --> 00:01:18,976
[They can only give out their signature to
the fans who pressed their buttons.]

21
00:01:18,977 --> 00:01:21,432
What are you going to come
up with next?

22
00:01:21,788 --> 00:01:24,883
What kind of things do you guys
think of at the meetings?

23
00:01:24,884 --> 00:01:29,245
This man, this man, and this man...
it's going to take a real long time for them.

24
00:01:29,246 --> 00:01:30,352
[Not much hope for Suk Jin,
Kwang Soo and Ha Ha?]

25
00:01:30,387 --> 00:01:32,533
30 signatures isn't going to
take much time at all.

26
00:01:32,534 --> 00:01:35,821
I've been getting a lot of fans lately.

27
00:01:35,822 --> 00:01:38,348
Yes, I don't think this is
going to take long at all.

28
00:01:39,045 --> 00:01:41,421
So they can press any one
of the buttons?

29
00:01:41,422 --> 00:01:44,650
<i>That's why in a case where the crowd presses
someone else's button other than yours</i>

30
00:01:44,651 --> 00:01:48,523
<i>you'll have to stamp a seal that says
'Out of stock' for the crowd.</i>

31
00:01:49,988 --> 00:01:52,294
This is a popularity contest, isn't it?

32
00:01:52,295 --> 00:01:54,310
Then can I get my manager and
my stylist to do it too?

33
00:01:54,311 --> 00:01:56,426
- Hey, guys...
- You can't get your family to vote for you.

34
00:02:03,352 --> 00:02:05,522
[Time for them to sneak into the booth
without anyone else being aware of it.]

35
00:02:06,057 --> 00:02:09,885
[Everyone's in!
RM signing booth is now in operation.]

36
00:02:21,157 --> 00:02:23,432
Who's going to stop by
when this place is so remote?

37
00:02:25,652 --> 00:02:28,087
[And in another location...]

38
00:02:28,088 --> 00:02:30,873
[Another remote location.]

39
00:02:32,294 --> 00:02:34,326
I should be in front of an elementary school.

40
00:02:36,806 --> 00:02:39,732
Namyang is where Kwang Soo is from.

41
00:02:39,733 --> 00:02:42,651
[Now that they think about it,
Namyang is Kwang Soo's hometown.]

42
00:02:42,652 --> 00:02:45,725
<i>Citizens of Namyang... Let's
show them what Namyang is made of!</i>

43
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,202
We are as one.

44
00:02:50,911 --> 00:02:52,672
What do I do?
I'm going to go out of my mind.

45
00:02:53,185 --> 00:02:56,217
<i>Who's going to come here?
My booth looks like it's been abandoned.</i>

46
00:02:57,170 --> 00:02:58,819
This is in the middle of nowhere.

47
00:02:59,399 --> 00:03:02,061
<i>I'm sorry, but this place...</i>

48
00:03:02,354 --> 00:03:04,380
<i>This place is way too remote.</i>

49
00:03:04,381 --> 00:03:06,939
<i>Take a look around this place.</i>

50
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:08,970
<i>We're in the middle of a
mountain out here.</i>

51
00:03:10,926 --> 00:03:12,507
This isn't going to work.

52
00:03:13,578 --> 00:03:17,243
[Even Ji Hyo's booth in front of the
health building is devoid of any people.]

53
00:03:19,634 --> 00:03:21,643
I want to sign for someone.

54
00:03:23,331 --> 00:03:25,139
<i>Someone please come and
get my signature.</i>

55
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:27,654
<i>I will give you my signature for free.</i>

56
00:03:28,491 --> 00:03:31,715
[Trying to lure people in by calling out
in a high pitched machine voice.]

57
00:03:31,716 --> 00:03:33,165
<i>Ma'am!</i>

58
00:03:33,424 --> 00:03:34,819
<i>Ma'am!</i>

59
00:03:37,402 --> 00:03:40,349
[Has Jae Suk already been selected,
and is about to give out his signature?]

60
00:03:41,527 --> 00:03:44,862
[Ah... he's forcefully giving the PD
his signature as a gift?]

61
00:03:44,863 --> 00:03:46,770
Tell them that this is a gift from me.

62
00:03:46,771 --> 00:03:50,453
I always used to sign, 'Study hard', but
I changed it to, 'Do a good job of editing.'

63
00:03:50,454 --> 00:03:52,491
I want him to do a good job of editing.

64
00:03:52,492 --> 00:03:54,711
Here, you can have one too.

65
00:03:55,586 --> 00:04:00,256
[Through this method, his VJ and the PD
already have ten of his signatures.]

66
00:04:01,949 --> 00:04:05,373
[But, just then...]

67
00:04:05,374 --> 00:04:09,106
[Oh?]

68
00:04:09,107 --> 00:04:12,389
[Someone... came up to the booth!]

69
00:04:17,381 --> 00:04:19,360
[After 40 long minutes...]

70
00:04:19,361 --> 00:04:24,085
[A first customer for Kkuk?]

71
00:04:28,478 --> 00:04:31,078
[Just leaves after a brief glance!]

72
00:04:31,742 --> 00:04:33,912
[Ah...]

73
00:04:34,418 --> 00:04:37,369
[Waiting...]

74
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:40,760
[Feeling defeated...]

75
00:04:40,761 --> 00:04:43,697
[Falls asleep.]

76
00:04:44,939 --> 00:04:46,928
<i>Hello!</i>

77
00:04:47,501 --> 00:04:50,184
<i>Is anyone out there?</i>

78
00:04:51,542 --> 00:04:53,405
<i>I'm stuck in here.</i>

79
00:04:53,811 --> 00:04:58,590
<i>My freedom has left me,
and I'm left in here to cry on my own.</i>

80
00:04:59,042 --> 00:05:02,772
<i>Ah... my unattainable dream.</i>

81
00:05:03,538 --> 00:05:06,354
<i>I'm suddenly reminded of a thought.</i>

82
00:05:06,988 --> 00:05:09,410
<i>Something that a director
once said to me.</i>

83
00:05:10,953 --> 00:05:13,761
[Just then]

84
00:05:14,713 --> 00:05:16,369
[Oh?]

85
00:05:17,301 --> 00:05:19,492
[Someone is standing out in front
of Gary's booth!]

86
00:05:19,493 --> 00:05:21,529
<i>[What is this?]</i>

87
00:05:23,611 --> 00:05:25,704
<i>[Please!]</i>

88
00:05:26,997 --> 00:05:33,654
[First customer of the day!
Will he choose Gary?]

89
00:05:35,773 --> 00:05:37,920
[Ji Hyo is chosen!]

90
00:05:41,291 --> 00:05:42,637
[Disappointment]

91
00:05:44,598 --> 00:05:48,007
[Must give them a card with 'Out of stock'
stamp on it when someone else is chosen.]

92
00:05:49,589 --> 00:05:51,157
<i>Nothing happened.</i>

93
00:05:52,505 --> 00:05:55,607
[He leaves without even taking
the 'Out of stock' card.]

94
00:05:55,608 --> 00:05:58,599
[Darn...]

95
00:06:02,655 --> 00:06:04,593
Okay, Sam.
Make your move.

96
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,000
Sam, where are you going?

97
00:06:07,001 --> 00:06:09,253
[Starting to talk to the bugs
out of his loneliness.]

98
00:06:10,381 --> 00:06:11,572
Sam!

99
00:06:16,725 --> 00:06:18,255
[Someone's here!]

100
00:06:19,367 --> 00:06:21,516
[His first customer after
an hour of waiting!]

101
00:06:22,469 --> 00:06:23,933
[Nervous anticipation.]

102
00:06:25,571 --> 00:06:27,261
[Let's see here...]

103
00:06:28,585 --> 00:06:32,900
[Will he... choose Ha Ha?]

104
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:36,007
<i>Yoo Jae Suk.</i>

105
00:06:36,008 --> 00:06:37,084
[Ah... he chose Jae Suk.]

106
00:06:37,085 --> 00:06:38,557
<i>Yoo Jae Suk.</i>

107
00:06:47,505 --> 00:06:49,045
Out of stock?
Running Man?

108
00:06:51,141 --> 00:06:52,396
Song Ji Hyo.

109
00:06:53,299 --> 00:06:54,492
<i>Song Ji Hyo.</i>

110
00:06:55,979 --> 00:06:58,574
[Twice in a row.]

111
00:07:01,065 --> 00:07:02,934
[That's out of stock too?]

112
00:07:05,041 --> 00:07:06,475
Kim Jong Kook.

113
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:16,911
Why are they all out of stock?

114
00:07:21,755 --> 00:07:25,073
[I want to cry.]

115
00:07:26,068 --> 00:07:29,677
<i>Thank you for your love and support
for Running Man.</i>

116
00:07:30,445 --> 00:07:31,493
<i>Big-nose.</i>

117
00:07:31,494 --> 00:07:35,877
[Oh... Big-nose Brother's booth
finally gets his first customer!]

118
00:07:35,878 --> 00:07:37,684
[Chooses Ji Hyo as soon as
he steps inside.]

119
00:07:37,685 --> 00:07:39,974
Do you love Song Ji Hyo?

120
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:44,872
I'm sorry, but Song Ji Hyo
is out of stock.

121
00:07:46,519 --> 00:07:47,693
What is this?

122
00:07:48,545 --> 00:07:49,798
Then I'll pick Yoo Jae Suk.

123
00:07:53,293 --> 00:07:55,570
Yoo Jae Suk is also out of stock.

124
00:07:57,045 --> 00:07:59,704
[Doesn't seem to be interested in anyone else
other than Jae Suk and Ji Hyo.]

125
00:08:00,826 --> 00:08:02,431
<i>I like Ji Suk Jin.</i>

126
00:08:03,241 --> 00:08:05,009
<i>I like Ji Suk Jin.</i>

127
00:08:08,236 --> 00:08:11,452
Since all the booths seem to be lacking
in popularity and interest...

128
00:08:11,793 --> 00:08:15,123
- I think ten would be plenty.
- Ten?

129
00:08:15,124 --> 00:08:17,276
We've decided to settle for five.

130
00:08:17,637 --> 00:08:19,304
Okay, let's go with five.

131
00:08:21,345 --> 00:08:27,178
[A crumbling defeat for the booths.
New goal- Five signatures.]

132
00:08:28,599 --> 00:08:29,877
<i>Save me!</i>

133
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:32,435
<i>There's someone in here!</i>

134
00:08:33,377 --> 00:08:34,683
Anyone!

135
00:08:34,684 --> 00:08:37,620
[Namyang's prodigy who has yet to see
a single customer in his booth.]

136
00:08:37,621 --> 00:08:39,506
It's Running Man!

137
00:08:40,841 --> 00:08:42,859
[Giraffe 1]
Wow! Running Man must be filming here!

138
00:08:43,261 --> 00:08:44,794
[Giraffe 2]
Really? Where?

139
00:08:46,005 --> 00:08:48,543
[You are doing okay in there, aren't you?]

140
00:08:48,544 --> 00:08:50,982
Really?
Then should we check out the booth?

141
00:08:51,659 --> 00:08:54,091
<i>Wow, it's a Running Man booth!</i>

142
00:08:55,049 --> 00:08:57,037
<i>Wow, that's so fascinating!</i>

143
00:09:00,397 --> 00:09:05,586
[Not a single customer for Kwang Soo...
Deciding to relocating the booth.]

144
00:09:07,057 --> 00:09:08,493
Let's all stay focused and strong.

145
00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:13,067
I have to get all the signatures
for the rest of you to be freed, too.

146
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:16,369
<i>This is my final hope.</i>

147
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:19,735
[Ultimately decides to move Kwang Soo's
booth next to the local supermarket.]

148
00:09:24,414 --> 00:09:25,894
Hello, Ma'am.

149
00:09:25,895 --> 00:09:28,430
- Hello.
- Oh my goodness. Hello!

150
00:09:28,431 --> 00:09:30,254
I can't believe it's you.

151
00:09:30,255 --> 00:09:35,772
That booth over there is where you can get
a signature from Running Man members.

152
00:09:35,773 --> 00:09:37,576
- Will you please go use the booth?
- Could I?

153
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:38,685
Yes, please.

154
00:09:38,686 --> 00:09:42,937
You just go in and press whomever you'd like.
Just disregard the fact that I'm in there.

155
00:09:43,495 --> 00:09:47,690
You just step inside and press the picture of
the person who's signature you'd like to have.

156
00:09:47,691 --> 00:09:49,978
Yes.
Please don't mind me, okay?

157
00:09:49,979 --> 00:09:51,481
You just press whomever you'd like.

158
00:09:53,156 --> 00:09:54,652
I think that she's so pretty.

159
00:09:56,337 --> 00:09:58,614
- I think that she's so pretty.
- Excuse me?

160
00:10:00,512 --> 00:10:03,694
[Can't you see that I'm in here?]

161
00:10:04,776 --> 00:10:07,178
- Are you really disregarding me?
- I just pressed her button.

162
00:10:07,179 --> 00:10:09,095
You pressed Ji Hyo's button, right?

163
00:10:09,096 --> 00:10:10,247
Yes, I did.

164
00:10:10,969 --> 00:10:14,788
[You should've just asked her
to press your button.]

165
00:10:19,095 --> 00:10:21,606
[Maybe I should've pressed
Kwang Soo's button.]

166
00:10:26,371 --> 00:10:28,118
There's a fly sitting on my face.

167
00:10:29,624 --> 00:10:32,408
<i>[Do you want me to ask you
for your signature?]</i>

168
00:10:34,138 --> 00:10:36,455
Can you hit the slate for me?
I've run out of tape.

169
00:10:36,456 --> 00:10:38,918
How can you be out of tape?
You haven't even filmed anything.

170
00:10:38,919 --> 00:10:41,297
How can you be out of tape
when you haven't even filmed anything?

171
00:10:41,298 --> 00:10:43,460
[An hour has already gone by
without a single customer...]

172
00:10:44,296 --> 00:10:46,442
[Just then]

173
00:10:46,443 --> 00:10:49,989
[A male student can be seen
walking up to the booth!]

174
00:10:50,963 --> 00:10:52,693
[He's in the booth!]

175
00:10:53,573 --> 00:10:56,014
[Takes him by surprise in the midst
of switching out the tape.]

176
00:10:58,964 --> 00:11:01,318
[Who will he choose?]

177
00:11:01,319 --> 00:11:04,139
[Blank Ji is selected again!]

178
00:11:16,263 --> 00:11:17,671
[Is someone back there?]

179
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:25,908
All the male students love Ji Hyo.

180
00:11:28,714 --> 00:11:32,294
[Second customer for
Gary's booth at the gas station.]

181
00:11:37,464 --> 00:11:41,353
[Ji Hyo again!]

182
00:11:48,763 --> 00:11:50,447
Song Ji Hyo's out of stock?

183
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:53,189
It's because she's already mine!

184
00:11:56,491 --> 00:11:58,490
<i>Please!
Please!</i>

185
00:11:58,491 --> 00:11:59,861
Song Ji Hyo.

186
00:12:01,482 --> 00:12:04,874
[All the men love Blank Ji!]

187
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:15,877
[Getting his revenge on the popular ones
by drawing on their faces.]

188
00:12:18,413 --> 00:12:20,685
[A hot mess.]

189
00:12:22,033 --> 00:12:25,602
[Everyone seems to be thinking
on the same wavelength.]

190
00:12:38,997 --> 00:12:40,747
<i>Someone's here.</i>

191
00:12:41,784 --> 00:12:45,350
[Three female guests at Blank Ji's booth!]

192
00:12:46,447 --> 00:12:48,300
I think you should try pressing something.

193
00:12:48,301 --> 00:12:50,825
<i>Try pressing the button for Song Ji Hyo.
Kids in my class love Song Ji Hyo.</i>

194
00:12:50,947 --> 00:12:52,773
<i>- Song Ji Hyo.
- Is this what I press?</i>

195
00:12:52,774 --> 00:12:54,302
<i>Press it.
It says to press the button.</i>

196
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:59,731
[Selects Blank Ji!]

197
00:13:01,394 --> 00:13:04,932
[First member to succeed in
handing out her signature!]

198
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:08,387
<i>- Wow!
- Oh my goodness!</i>

199
00:13:08,952 --> 00:13:10,226
<i>Try Yoo Jae Suk.</i>

200
00:13:13,347 --> 00:13:15,865
[Unfortunately,
Yoo Jae Suk is out of stock.]

201
00:13:15,866 --> 00:13:18,281
<i>- Yoo Jae Suk is out of stock.
- What? What the heck!</i>

202
00:13:19,355 --> 00:13:21,746
[They select Jong Kook next!]

203
00:13:22,258 --> 00:13:24,527
- He's out of stock too!
- What the heck!

204
00:13:28,998 --> 00:13:32,392
[That's our ace!
The lone member to succeed!]

205
00:13:32,393 --> 00:13:34,134
My name was the first button
they pressed.

206
00:13:36,696 --> 00:13:39,662
[At the same time, a customer walks
into Jae Suk's signing booth.]

207
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:44,706
<i>[Welcome]</i>

208
00:13:44,707 --> 00:13:48,447
<i>Please choose the person
who's signature you wish to have.</i>

209
00:13:48,448 --> 00:13:55,696
<i>You've selected Yoo Jae Suk's signature.</i>

210
00:13:55,697 --> 00:13:59,841
<i>Please state your name.</i>

211
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,090
Lee Mi Sun.

212
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:04,877
<i>Mi. Sun.</i>

213
00:14:05,667 --> 00:14:08,723
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

214
00:14:13,751 --> 00:14:15,759
[Jae Suk also succeeds in getting out
his first signature.]

215
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,013
Gary, Gary, Gary!

216
00:14:19,215 --> 00:14:22,267
[But this customer chooses Jae Suk.]

217
00:14:25,231 --> 00:14:27,658
Everyone either wants Yoo Jae Suk
or Song Ji Hyo.

218
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:31,310
[Just then.]

219
00:14:31,311 --> 00:14:33,537
[Gary's picture is suddenly lit up?]

220
00:14:35,608 --> 00:14:38,615
[Some male customer walks in
and chooses Gary!]

221
00:14:39,294 --> 00:14:41,867
[Gary finally gets his chance
to hand out his signature!]

222
00:14:50,276 --> 00:14:51,986
<i>Me!
It's me!</i>

223
00:14:55,671 --> 00:14:57,484
[Ha Ha also succeeds in getting out
his first signature!]

224
00:14:57,485 --> 00:15:00,065
[Ecstatic]

225
00:15:02,473 --> 00:15:07,256
[And soon thereafter, Jong Kook succeeds
in getting his signature out.]

226
00:15:11,627 --> 00:15:14,567
[Jae Suk is the first member to
get his second signature out.]

227
00:15:14,568 --> 00:15:16,217
Is there something going on today?

228
00:15:20,051 --> 00:15:24,149
[Ji Hyo follows immediately with
her second signature.]

229
00:15:25,628 --> 00:15:27,181
[Thank you.]

230
00:15:27,669 --> 00:15:30,754
[Jae Suk's popularity...]

231
00:15:30,755 --> 00:15:33,090
[vs. Ji Hyo's popularity.]

232
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:37,160
[Five votes is their goal.
Jae Suk is currently on his fourth signature.]

233
00:15:38,797 --> 00:15:42,210
[Ji Hyo also has
only one more signature to go.]

234
00:15:51,707 --> 00:15:53,569
<i>Sign!</i>

235
00:15:53,947 --> 00:15:55,595
<i>Sign!</i>

236
00:15:59,323 --> 00:16:00,964
<i>We'll give you our signature.</i>

237
00:16:01,801 --> 00:16:03,437
<i>We'll give you our signature.</i>

238
00:16:06,157 --> 00:16:08,701
<i>Ji Suk Jin is recommended.
Ji Suk Jin is recommended.</i>

239
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:12,368
<i>Press your selection.</i>

240
00:16:16,768 --> 00:16:18,415
<i>Out of stock.</i>

241
00:16:23,033 --> 00:16:26,370
[Currently tied in first place.
Another guest walks into Jae Suk's booth.]

242
00:16:30,312 --> 00:16:33,514
[Currently tied in first place.
A guest walks into Ji Hyo's booth as well.]

243
00:16:37,321 --> 00:16:38,984
[Only one signature left to go.]

244
00:16:39,804 --> 00:16:42,163
[Let's see here...]

245
00:16:43,358 --> 00:16:46,758
[Just which of the two will be the first
to get out all five of their signatures?]

246
00:16:49,131 --> 00:16:51,822
[They both choose
the owner of their booth!]

247
00:16:55,306 --> 00:16:59,743
[They simultaneously succeed
their mission!]

248
00:17:04,534 --> 00:17:05,953
- Yoo Jae Suk.
- Yes?

249
00:17:05,954 --> 00:17:08,985
- Congratulations, you've succeeded.
- Yes, thank you.

250
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:12,468
[Passes over a mission cellphone.]

251
00:17:12,469 --> 00:17:13,781
Really?

252
00:17:15,295 --> 00:17:16,792
I have a text message.

253
00:17:17,941 --> 00:17:24,881
<i>[Make your way over to Sudong Building
in Namyang District.]</i>

254
00:17:24,882 --> 00:17:26,707
<i>[You will find your mission for the day
at that location.]</i>

255
00:17:26,708 --> 00:17:28,935
<i>[You must find your own transportation to
get yourself there as quickly as possible.]</i>

256
00:17:29,851 --> 00:17:35,120
[They must find their own mode of
transportation for the rest of the day.]

257
00:17:35,917 --> 00:17:37,204
Hello.

258
00:17:37,205 --> 00:17:39,481
I have a place that I need to get to.

259
00:17:41,016 --> 00:17:47,093
[Just which one of the two will be the first
to arrive at the mission location?]

260
00:17:49,393 --> 00:17:51,641
There are a lot of those photo booths.

261
00:17:51,642 --> 00:17:53,114
There's one over there too.

262
00:17:53,115 --> 00:17:54,839
I guess whomever is in there
is still working at it.

263
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,039
[Jae Suk discovers
Suk Jin's booth on his way.]

264
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:59,278
<i>Ji Suk Jin is so cute!</i>

265
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:01,983
Free signature!
It's free!

266
00:18:02,777 --> 00:18:05,301
<i>It's free!</i>

267
00:18:06,432 --> 00:18:11,477
[Jae Suk stops by on his way
to play a trick.]

268
00:18:13,248 --> 00:18:14,910
Please make your selection.

269
00:18:16,573 --> 00:18:19,376
[Jae Suk pretending to be a random
person off the streets.]

270
00:18:19,377 --> 00:18:21,558
[And he selects Big-nosed Brother.]

271
00:18:22,107 --> 00:18:24,418
[One man stays oblivious to what's going on
and is excited that he's finally chosen.]

272
00:18:26,385 --> 00:18:28,138
Thank you!

273
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:32,218
[Ah... you cruel man.]

274
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:42,988
<i>Have a great day.</i>

275
00:18:46,305 --> 00:18:48,845
[I want to return my signature.]

276
00:18:49,569 --> 00:18:52,513
[What is this?]

277
00:18:52,514 --> 00:18:53,899
Why is he giving it back?

278
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:55,769
You can have the signature for free.

279
00:19:04,353 --> 00:19:05,918
You startled me.

280
00:19:08,378 --> 00:19:09,543
You startled me.

281
00:19:09,544 --> 00:19:10,754
What are you doing?

282
00:19:11,155 --> 00:19:12,582
Sorry, that didn't count.

283
00:19:13,043 --> 00:19:14,706
That was you?

284
00:19:14,707 --> 00:19:16,811
- Are you done now?
- Yes, I'm done now.

285
00:19:16,812 --> 00:19:18,158
- Seriously?
- Bye, I'll see you later.

286
00:19:18,159 --> 00:19:20,726
- How many have you gotten so far?
- I think I've got two.

287
00:19:21,526 --> 00:19:22,579
Seriously.

288
00:19:24,915 --> 00:19:28,700
[Good-natured Big-nosed Brother
goes back to work.]

289
00:19:29,643 --> 00:19:31,151
<i>Ugh, seriously.</i>

290
00:19:32,538 --> 00:19:35,824
[Kkuk's busy photo booth.
Only has one more signature left to go.]

291
00:19:35,825 --> 00:19:38,632
- Make your selection.
- What did it say?

292
00:19:38,667 --> 00:19:40,942
- I said, make your selection.
- Make a selection?

293
00:19:42,351 --> 00:19:44,285
[Chooses Kkuk.]

294
00:19:48,402 --> 00:19:49,901
[Ecstatic]

295
00:19:50,723 --> 00:19:53,281
[Kkuk also succeeds in handing out
five signatures.]

296
00:19:55,967 --> 00:19:58,820
[This makes five for Gary as well.]

297
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:02,004
- Is someone back there?
- No, Sir.

298
00:20:03,377 --> 00:20:06,282
[Gary succeeds the mission.]

299
00:20:06,283 --> 00:20:11,170
<i>Go to the address provided.
There, you will find your mission.</i>

300
00:20:11,171 --> 00:20:13,077
- It's close enough for you to run there.
- I can run over there?

301
00:20:14,041 --> 00:20:15,871
I think I'm going to run over there.

302
00:20:15,872 --> 00:20:18,631
[Deciding to run over to the address after
having asked the attendant for directions.]

303
00:20:19,911 --> 00:20:21,865
I'm the first one here.

304
00:20:21,866 --> 00:20:26,170
[Jae Suk finally arrives at the location
written on the mission statement.]

305
00:20:27,268 --> 00:20:28,898
Song Ji Hyo!

306
00:20:28,899 --> 00:20:31,414
I'm not the first one here?
I thought I was the first one to get here.

307
00:20:31,415 --> 00:20:33,418
I was the first one to arrive here.

308
00:20:33,419 --> 00:20:36,804
Even if you were the first one here...
How frustrating. I didn't know.

309
00:20:36,805 --> 00:20:39,517
We're supposed to find our mission.
I even have a map here.

310
00:20:39,518 --> 00:20:40,711
What's the mission?

311
00:20:40,712 --> 00:20:43,372
<i>You have to find
the mission for yourselves today.</i>

312
00:20:43,373 --> 00:20:44,515
<i>It's somewhere at the address provided.</i>

313
00:20:44,516 --> 00:20:47,723
How are we supposed to find the mission?
You have to tell us.

314
00:20:50,037 --> 00:20:52,431
- Hey, by the way...
- That address is your hint.

315
00:20:52,432 --> 00:20:54,218
[The only clue that they're given is
the address provided by the writers.]

316
00:20:55,468 --> 00:20:58,687
[No matter what the case,
it's quite close to their current location.]

317
00:20:58,688 --> 00:21:01,542
It's showing that it's right around here.
It's somewhere in that direction.

318
00:21:02,046 --> 00:21:04,483
[Because the other way
would just be a field...]

319
00:21:07,151 --> 00:21:09,468
Why do you keep following me?
Follow your own map.

320
00:21:09,469 --> 00:21:12,005
I'm following the map myself.

321
00:21:12,833 --> 00:21:16,348
[Following the address they're given...]

322
00:21:16,349 --> 00:21:18,981
[And they arrive at a furniture store?]

323
00:21:18,982 --> 00:21:20,489
It's showing that it's around
here somewhere.

324
00:21:20,666 --> 00:21:23,407
[First floor is the showroom.
Could the mission be somewhere in here?]

325
00:21:23,408 --> 00:21:24,633
It's this way.

326
00:21:27,201 --> 00:21:29,937
[After having completed his booth mission,
Kkuk also arrives at the furniture store.]

327
00:21:31,895 --> 00:21:33,203
I can see Jae Suk in there.

328
00:21:33,204 --> 00:21:34,780
This has to be the place.

329
00:21:34,781 --> 00:21:37,644
I think this is the place.
I think this is the address.

330
00:21:37,645 --> 00:21:39,803
- There has to be something in here.
- Yes.

331
00:21:40,121 --> 00:21:42,751
[Springing into action already.
Kkuk starts off his investigation.]

332
00:21:42,752 --> 00:21:46,297
- What are you looking at?
- Don't you even know the basics of a search?

333
00:21:46,298 --> 00:21:47,965
I'm starting off with searching
all the little stuff.

334
00:21:47,966 --> 00:21:49,383
We're here.

335
00:21:49,384 --> 00:21:50,742
This is the place.

336
00:21:51,258 --> 00:21:54,160
[After looking into it further,
this whole place encompasses the address.]

337
00:21:54,161 --> 00:21:55,514
Hello everyone.

338
00:21:55,515 --> 00:21:57,361
- Hello.
- Can we come in for a moment?

339
00:21:57,362 --> 00:21:58,853
Yes, thank you.

340
00:22:01,263 --> 00:22:04,722
I heard that you have a mission for us?
Can you tell us what the mission is?

341
00:22:05,557 --> 00:22:08,377
- I just got here myself, so I'm not sure.
- Ah, I see.

342
00:22:09,283 --> 00:22:12,489
Sir, do you happen to know
what our mission is?

343
00:22:15,157 --> 00:22:18,001
Why are you listening in? I was
the one who asked them the question.

344
00:22:18,516 --> 00:22:20,315
- I was just...
- Come on, Ji Hyo.

345
00:22:21,425 --> 00:22:23,127
<i>Please use the photo booth.</i>

346
00:22:24,859 --> 00:22:26,540
<i>Please use the photo booth.</i>

347
00:22:27,207 --> 00:22:28,429
<i>[Someone, please!]</i>

348
00:22:29,708 --> 00:22:31,815
[Just then, a male adult enters the booth.]

349
00:22:32,579 --> 00:22:34,801
Please make your selection to
receive your signature.

350
00:22:38,935 --> 00:22:42,525
[Please... I want to escape from here!]

351
00:22:42,526 --> 00:22:44,337
I'll just go with Lee Kwang Soo.

352
00:22:45,812 --> 00:22:48,143
- Lee Kwang Soo was your selection?
- Yes, he was.

353
00:22:48,355 --> 00:22:49,814
[Wow- The Giraffe finally succeeds
in getting out all five of his signatures.]

354
00:22:49,815 --> 00:22:52,636
[Giraffe succeeds the booth mission.]

355
00:22:55,268 --> 00:22:57,088
- I've already searched everywhere.
- So you're here to pick out the furniture?

356
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:00,861
[Is Monday Couple here to pick out
their furniture for their newlywed house?]

357
00:23:00,896 --> 00:23:03,154
Ji Hyo, pick out whatever you like.

358
00:23:03,155 --> 00:23:05,415
- Is that the piece you like?
- Yes.

359
00:23:05,415 --> 00:23:07,119
- Kang Gary.
- Yeah?

360
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,826
[Picks out something she likes as soon as
the words leave Gary's mouth.]

361
00:23:09,145 --> 00:23:11,769
I like this piece over here.
I like the red chair.

362
00:23:12,141 --> 00:23:13,731
That piece doesn't really suit you.

363
00:23:14,127 --> 00:23:17,817
Don't buy that.
You can just sit on my lap.

364
00:23:18,913 --> 00:23:21,422
[What a piece of work...]

365
00:23:24,173 --> 00:23:25,470
Did you get a text?

366
00:23:27,143 --> 00:23:28,511
It's Kwang Soo.

367
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:31,364
Hey, Kwang Soo.
What is it?

368
00:23:31,658 --> 00:23:34,252
- Hi, Jae Suk.
- I'm filming right now. Call me back later.

369
00:23:35,909 --> 00:23:38,256
Jae Suk!
I'm filming right now too.

370
00:23:38,257 --> 00:23:41,118
- Hey, Suk Jin's here too.
- Seriously?

371
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:42,208
<i>Yeah.</i>

372
00:23:42,209 --> 00:23:43,460
I'll be...

373
00:23:44,011 --> 00:23:45,116
What is this?

374
00:23:49,538 --> 00:23:50,799
But...

375
00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:52,754
<i>Hurry up and get here.</i>

376
00:23:53,952 --> 00:23:56,525
[This...]

377
00:23:56,526 --> 00:24:00,631
[This is...]

378
00:24:00,632 --> 00:24:02,327
Wait, I know this place.

379
00:24:02,328 --> 00:24:03,384
What?

380
00:24:04,256 --> 00:24:08,078
[What? He knows this place?]

381
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:11,433
[Just what is the mystery behind
this furniture factory?]

382
00:24:12,179 --> 00:24:15,130
[It does seem like Kwang Soo
is familiar with this place...]

383
00:24:15,944 --> 00:24:17,711
We're here.
This is the place.

384
00:24:18,209 --> 00:24:19,453
Wait...

385
00:24:21,593 --> 00:24:23,425
What is this?
What are we doing here?

386
00:24:24,704 --> 00:24:27,314
I know this place very well.

387
00:24:27,315 --> 00:24:29,526
I know this place very well!

388
00:24:29,527 --> 00:24:33,193
[He knows the place well?
Could it be his favorite furniture store?]

389
00:24:33,193 --> 00:24:36,721
[Why does he suddenly look so relaxed?]

390
00:24:37,358 --> 00:24:38,624
Ji Hyo!

391
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,429
This is the place?

392
00:24:41,371 --> 00:24:43,262
How did they know about this place?

393
00:24:43,787 --> 00:24:46,106
Jae Suk!
Do you know what this place is?

394
00:24:46,107 --> 00:24:47,947
- What?
- I asked if you knew what this place was.

395
00:24:47,948 --> 00:24:48,968
Why?

396
00:24:48,969 --> 00:24:50,775
What are we doing here?

397
00:24:51,423 --> 00:24:52,839
- Why? What's going on?
- What's going on here?

398
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:53,885
Why?
What is it?

399
00:24:54,639 --> 00:24:56,670
What?
What about this place?

400
00:24:56,671 --> 00:24:58,305
- Is this a hidden camera?
- What?

401
00:24:58,306 --> 00:24:59,921
- What is this?
- Why? What is it?

402
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:02,406
- What?
- What is it?

403
00:25:02,407 --> 00:25:06,253
[Just... what is this place?]

404
00:25:06,254 --> 00:25:09,502
This is my dad's place.

405
00:25:11,086 --> 00:25:14,432
[This is Kwang Soo's father's place?]

406
00:25:14,433 --> 00:25:16,393
- Get yourself together!
- I'm serious!

407
00:25:16,793 --> 00:25:18,323
This really is my dad's work.

408
00:25:18,324 --> 00:25:20,569
[Yoo Hyuk seems to have figured out
what's going on.]

409
00:25:21,492 --> 00:25:23,525
- What are you doing?
- Seriously?

410
00:25:24,854 --> 00:25:26,526
This is my dad's place of work.

411
00:25:26,527 --> 00:25:28,536
[Could Kwang Soo's father be the mission?]

412
00:25:28,537 --> 00:25:30,426
- Are we supposed to find your dad?
- Are you serious?

413
00:25:30,427 --> 00:25:31,697
Why?

414
00:25:32,291 --> 00:25:35,067
- Hey! Where is he?
- What are you guys doing?

415
00:25:35,068 --> 00:25:36,633
Where are you going?

416
00:25:37,289 --> 00:25:38,481
Jae Suk!

417
00:25:38,482 --> 00:25:40,013
[Even though they don't know
what the mission is...]

418
00:25:40,014 --> 00:25:41,256
[Their priority is to find
Kwang Soo's father!]

419
00:25:41,257 --> 00:25:42,387
Who are you looking for?

420
00:25:43,203 --> 00:25:45,191
Dad!

421
00:25:46,497 --> 00:25:47,592
Where are you going?

422
00:25:47,593 --> 00:25:49,437
[Everyone's suddenly in a rush
to find Kwang Soo's dad!]

423
00:25:49,438 --> 00:25:52,053
- What's the mission?
- I don't know!

424
00:25:52,088 --> 00:25:53,908
It's Kwang Soo's father.

425
00:25:53,909 --> 00:25:55,531
Are you looking for my dad?

426
00:25:56,744 --> 00:25:58,986
[The Giraffe finally figures out
what's going on.]

427
00:25:58,987 --> 00:26:01,412
Why are you guys all getting so excited?

428
00:26:01,413 --> 00:26:03,841
I used to work here when
I was a little kid.

429
00:26:03,842 --> 00:26:05,599
- This is your father's factory?
- Yes.

430
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,769
- I used to work here a lot when I was a kid.
- Seriously?

431
00:26:07,770 --> 00:26:10,132
- I used to...
- Hello!

432
00:26:11,189 --> 00:26:13,305
[A face that all the workers
seem to know.]

433
00:26:14,507 --> 00:26:16,361
Where's Kwang Soo's father?

434
00:26:16,362 --> 00:26:18,238
Where's Kwang Soo's father?

435
00:26:18,919 --> 00:26:19,997
Sir.

436
00:26:19,998 --> 00:26:24,201
[Could this man...
be Kwang Soo's father?]

437
00:26:24,202 --> 00:26:26,023
Sorry, you've got the wrong person.

438
00:26:26,491 --> 00:26:28,807
[Even though there is some resemblance,
he is not Kwang Soo's father.]

439
00:26:29,971 --> 00:26:33,746
- Where? Where is he?
- On the third floor of the across building.

440
00:26:33,747 --> 00:26:35,727
[Third floor of the building across the way!]

441
00:26:37,131 --> 00:26:38,883
[Yoo Hyuk finally figures out
where Kwang Soo's father is!]

442
00:26:38,884 --> 00:26:40,169
- Did you find it?
- No!

443
00:26:41,675 --> 00:26:43,175
Hello.

444
00:26:45,432 --> 00:26:49,043
[At this rate, Jae Suk
will get to his own dad first!]

445
00:26:50,229 --> 00:26:52,377
- Follow Kwang Soo!
- Why?

446
00:26:53,050 --> 00:26:54,460
Dad!

447
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,587
Dad, where are you?

448
00:26:56,588 --> 00:26:57,860
Third floor?

449
00:26:57,861 --> 00:27:00,392
Don't open your door for anyone!

450
00:27:00,393 --> 00:27:02,022
Lock the door and don't
open it for anyone!

451
00:27:02,489 --> 00:27:03,929
I want you to lock the door!

452
00:27:05,964 --> 00:27:08,576
[Yoo Hyuk is the first one to
arrive on the third floor.]

453
00:27:10,215 --> 00:27:13,104
Hello.
By any chance... are you his father?

454
00:27:14,065 --> 00:27:18,024
[Could this man...
be Kwang Soo's father?]

455
00:27:18,025 --> 00:27:19,151
Are you by any chance,
Lee Kwang Soo's father?

456
00:27:19,152 --> 00:27:20,989
- He just told me to lock the door.
- Are you by any chance...

457
00:27:20,990 --> 00:27:22,731
He just asked me to lock the door.

458
00:27:23,174 --> 00:27:25,622
[Jae Suk discovers Kwang Soo's father!]

459
00:27:26,825 --> 00:27:28,307
Dad!

460
00:27:28,308 --> 00:27:30,264
[His son is one step too late
in finding his own father.]

461
00:27:30,386 --> 00:27:31,526
Dad!

462
00:27:32,923 --> 00:27:34,712
- He's my dad!
- Father.

463
00:27:35,567 --> 00:27:38,398
[Having gone through Kwang Soo's agency
to find Kwang Soo's father.]

464
00:27:38,433 --> 00:27:41,682
His father?
Are you really Kwang Soo's father?

465
00:27:41,683 --> 00:27:42,708
Yes.

466
00:27:43,799 --> 00:27:47,422
[Son- Lee Kwang Soo and Father- Lee Jong Ho.
See the similarity?]

467
00:27:47,423 --> 00:27:50,641
- But your father is so handsome!
- What are you talking about?

468
00:27:50,642 --> 00:27:54,317
- Your father really is so good looking!
- This is an old picture of him.

469
00:27:54,318 --> 00:27:56,111
Why are you showing him that picture?

470
00:27:56,591 --> 00:27:59,199
[Such a cute little Giraffe...]

471
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,305
This is when Kwang Soo was little?
Your father is such a good looking man.

472
00:28:03,565 --> 00:28:05,926
[Big-nose greeting Kwang Soo's father
for the first time.]

473
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:08,824
[Everyone arriving one by one after
having followed Kwang Soo into the office.]

474
00:28:08,825 --> 00:28:11,005
Hello.
Hello, Father.

475
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:14,221
- This really is his father.
- Your father is so handsome, Kwang Soo.

476
00:28:14,222 --> 00:28:17,236
- Why do you all keep saying that?
- Can you get me a sofa at cost?

477
00:28:17,237 --> 00:28:19,860
[Taking his opportunity.]

478
00:28:19,861 --> 00:28:22,043
[Just then, the Tiger makes his entrance.]

479
00:28:22,044 --> 00:28:23,658
Dad!
This is the guy!

480
00:28:23,659 --> 00:28:25,359
This is the guy who
picks on me all the time!

481
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,019
This is the guy who
picks on me all the time!

482
00:28:27,429 --> 00:28:29,168
- This is the guy!
- You're in big trouble, Jong Kook.

483
00:28:29,169 --> 00:28:31,343
- This is the guy!
- This is Kwang Soo's father!

484
00:28:31,344 --> 00:28:33,341
This is the guy that torments me
all the time!

485
00:28:34,566 --> 00:28:36,312
[Yoo Hyuk takes this opportunity
to tattle on Jong Kook.]

486
00:28:36,313 --> 00:28:38,789
[His face is turning beet red!]

487
00:28:39,082 --> 00:28:41,496
He hits me even when
the cameras aren't rolling!

488
00:28:42,344 --> 00:28:44,901
I saw him hitting you
three to four times yesterday.

489
00:28:44,902 --> 00:28:46,949
Just smack him across the face!

490
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:49,164
[His father never misses an episode
of his own son's show!]

491
00:28:49,164 --> 00:28:51,758
You and Kwang Soo don't look
anything alike.

492
00:28:51,759 --> 00:28:55,008
I think Kwang Soo's looks changed from
having been on Running Man for so long.

493
00:28:55,009 --> 00:28:57,763
- That's right.
- So both your parents know how you are?

494
00:28:57,764 --> 00:29:00,859
So you changed because of the environment.
It's all because of Running Man.

495
00:29:01,204 --> 00:29:03,777
[Running Man DNA- Giraffe!]

496
00:29:03,778 --> 00:29:05,640
Didn't Kwang Soo recently
move out of the house?

497
00:29:05,641 --> 00:29:08,122
- Yes.
- You should go check out his new home.

498
00:29:08,565 --> 00:29:10,657
There could be another reason
why he moved out.

499
00:29:11,429 --> 00:29:14,260
Come on, this is my father!

500
00:29:14,261 --> 00:29:17,222
- All the more reason why he should.
- He's not an actor, but he's my real father.

501
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:22,803
It's because you don't look
anything like your father.

502
00:29:22,804 --> 00:29:24,859
I know.
He looks like he could be your brother.

503
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:26,486
Your father looks so young.

504
00:29:26,894 --> 00:29:28,417
[Just then... one person that they all had
forgotten about makes his arrival.]

505
00:29:28,418 --> 00:29:30,543
Wow... I can't believe that none of you
waited for me.

506
00:29:30,544 --> 00:29:32,461
- Dong Hoon!
- Where in the world are we?

507
00:29:32,462 --> 00:29:34,574
- Come say hello to Kwang Soo's father.
- What is going on here?

508
00:29:34,575 --> 00:29:36,858
- This is Kwang Soo's father.
- Seriously? Hello.

509
00:29:36,859 --> 00:29:39,392
[Immediately becoming docile after
being introduced to Kwang Soo's father.]

510
00:29:39,392 --> 00:29:42,327
Then is Kwang Soo's father
going to give us our mission?

511
00:29:42,328 --> 00:29:44,270
- Go ahead and ask him.
- What's the mission?

512
00:29:44,271 --> 00:29:46,236
There are no other missions.

513
00:29:46,237 --> 00:29:48,918
- Do you have something in your pocket?
- No, I didn't receive anything.

514
00:29:48,919 --> 00:29:51,525
- You don't have anything?
- Then is there something around here?

515
00:29:51,526 --> 00:29:53,978
I'm sure that there's something here.
We should search for it.

516
00:29:53,979 --> 00:29:55,903
[Could the mission be somewhere
around father's desk?]

517
00:29:55,903 --> 00:29:57,728
Could that picture he showed us
be the mission?

518
00:29:57,729 --> 00:30:00,706
- It has to be around here somewhere.
- Why are you all snooping around?

519
00:30:00,741 --> 00:30:02,820
We're not snooping.
We're just searching for a mission.

520
00:30:02,821 --> 00:30:06,041
- You didn't receive anything?
- That's right. This is Namyang.

521
00:30:06,042 --> 00:30:08,577
- This is Namyang.
- Here's a picture of Kwang Soo.

522
00:30:08,578 --> 00:30:10,157
Father, you have a phone call.

523
00:30:10,158 --> 00:30:11,670
[Kwang Soo's father receives a phone call?]

524
00:30:11,671 --> 00:30:13,725
Wow, Kwang Soo.

525
00:30:14,130 --> 00:30:15,160
Yes.

526
00:30:17,176 --> 00:30:21,487
[The mission is to be transmitted to father
five minutes after he was discovered.]

527
00:30:21,488 --> 00:30:24,031
- He just received something.
- It must've been about a mission.

528
00:30:24,066 --> 00:30:29,133
There's a showroom on the first floor,
and the mission is on one of the beds.

529
00:30:29,134 --> 00:30:30,822
[The mission can be found near a bed
in the showroom on the first floor!]

530
00:30:30,823 --> 00:30:32,632
- Thank you, Father!
- Thank you!

531
00:30:32,633 --> 00:30:34,578
- Thank you!
- Thank you!

532
00:30:37,767 --> 00:30:40,167
[Saving the farewell greetings for later,
and off to find the mission!]

533
00:30:40,168 --> 00:30:41,909
You should go too and
find the mission.

534
00:30:43,241 --> 00:30:45,544
- I'll call you later, Dad.
- Thank you!

535
00:30:45,545 --> 00:30:46,843
Where's the bed?

536
00:30:47,033 --> 00:30:49,551
[The mission is near
a bed in the showroom!]

537
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:51,919
A bed?

538
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,589
[Today's mission is near one of these
countless number of beds!]

539
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:55,149
Please make sure
to be careful with the furniture.

540
00:30:56,041 --> 00:30:59,425
- Watch what you're doing!
- Where is it?

541
00:31:00,631 --> 00:31:01,984
Is this it?

542
00:31:04,013 --> 00:31:06,987
[This is!]

543
00:31:07,839 --> 00:31:10,237
[Ace, Ji Hyo, discovers something!]

544
00:31:10,238 --> 00:31:11,825
- She's found something!
- What is it?

545
00:31:14,394 --> 00:31:15,812
- She found it.
- Hey!

546
00:31:18,201 --> 00:31:20,862
[Ji Hyo tries to run away
to look at the mission by herself.]

547
00:31:22,704 --> 00:31:24,854
- Did you find something?
- What is it?

548
00:31:24,855 --> 00:31:28,184
She really is something else.
Please have a seat, Princess.

549
00:31:28,185 --> 00:31:30,032
[Thus, everyone gets to find out together
just what the mission is.]

550
00:31:30,033 --> 00:31:33,557
- Let's all sit down and find out together.
- Yes, let's all look at it together.

551
00:31:34,226 --> 00:31:36,870
[It appears to be a book.
What could it be?]

552
00:31:36,871 --> 00:31:37,850
What could it be?

553
00:31:37,851 --> 00:31:39,181
<i>[Namyang race]</i>

554
00:31:39,181 --> 00:31:44,355
<i>[Pass each mission via the pictures in the
book to find the person who made the book.]</i>

555
00:31:44,358 --> 00:31:49,654
<i>[The person to attach a picture of themselves
with the author of the book is the winner.]</i>

556
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:58,120
[A book sent in by a young fan girl
who lives in the city of Namyang.]

557
00:31:58,121 --> 00:31:59,376
- What is this?
- It's a girl.

558
00:31:59,694 --> 00:32:02,334
<i>[Hello, it's such an honor
to meet you all like this.]</i>

559
00:32:02,335 --> 00:32:05,486
<i>[My name is ___,
and I'm a huge fan of Running Man.]</i>

560
00:32:05,708 --> 00:32:08,510
<i>[I currently live in Deokso,
which is two subway train stations</i>

561
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:12,754
<i>away from where
Lee Kwang Soo used to live.]</i>

562
00:32:13,661 --> 00:32:18,561
<i>[The reason why I sent you this is because
I would love for Running Man to come here.]</i>

563
00:32:18,562 --> 00:32:21,718
<i>[So I would like to give you a brief
introduction of my neighborhood.]</i>

564
00:32:22,075 --> 00:32:26,447
There's no mention of her name, her age,
or the name of the school she attends.

565
00:32:26,448 --> 00:32:28,208
- We have to find the girl who wrote this.
- Look.

566
00:32:28,943 --> 00:32:31,589
<i>[I've gone to watch the filming of
Running Man in the past.]</i>

567
00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:33,168
<i>[It was 'The Laws of the Jungle' episode.]</i>

568
00:32:33,169 --> 00:32:35,676
<i>[I watch Running Man every week.]</i>

569
00:32:36,433 --> 00:32:38,027
What are you doing!

570
00:32:38,028 --> 00:32:39,373
[Yoo Hyuk wanting to get closer to
the book of devotion sent in by the fan.]

571
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:42,386
[Everyone trying to get a little bit closer.]

572
00:32:43,749 --> 00:32:45,735
- What are you all doing?
- Hang on a minute.

573
00:32:45,736 --> 00:32:47,464
Let's all look at it together.

574
00:32:49,134 --> 00:32:50,514
- Let's all look at it together.
- Okay, here.

575
00:32:50,515 --> 00:32:52,052
<i>[I have an older and a younger sister.]</i>

576
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:54,262
<i>[My older sister is a junior in high school,
and she's interested in broadcast journalism</i>

577
00:32:54,263 --> 00:32:55,632
<i>and she's a huge fan of Running Man too.]</i>

578
00:32:55,633 --> 00:32:57,924
<i>[We're planning on going to see a filming
of the show after she takes the SAT's.]</i>

579
00:32:57,924 --> 00:33:00,549
- Which means she's younger than a junior.
- That would make her younger.

580
00:33:02,410 --> 00:33:05,160
[Whatever the case...]

581
00:33:05,161 --> 00:33:09,281
[The book shows how much love and dedication
she poured into making this fan book.]

582
00:33:13,228 --> 00:33:15,094
<i>Place the picture of yourself with the
author of the book in this spot.</i>

583
00:33:15,095 --> 00:33:17,924
- We have to find the author of the book.
- We have to find this girl.

584
00:33:17,925 --> 00:33:19,102
Our mission is to find her.

585
00:33:19,103 --> 00:33:23,462
The fan girl came to the station herself
to give me that book.

586
00:33:23,463 --> 00:33:26,065
- She really made this book herself?
- Yes, she gave it to me herself.

587
00:33:26,066 --> 00:33:27,759
She made this book all by herself?

588
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,490
I'm really touched right now.

589
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:33,444
[One day in August of 2013.]

590
00:33:35,918 --> 00:33:38,874
[A young fan girl disappears after
handing the book over to the writer.]

591
00:33:38,874 --> 00:33:41,000
<i>Do you see all those pictures
in that book?</i>

592
00:33:41,001 --> 00:33:44,408
<i>She went to all of those places herself
to take those pictures</i>

593
00:33:44,409 --> 00:33:47,384
<i>and she put them in that book along
with a description of each place.</i>

594
00:33:47,766 --> 00:33:51,942
<i>But what you're going to be doing, is
filling the rest of the empty spaces.</i>

595
00:33:52,244 --> 00:33:53,675
<i>Every time you finish a mission</i>

596
00:33:53,676 --> 00:33:55,049
<i>you'll be given a picture
to put into that book.</i>

597
00:33:55,050 --> 00:33:57,010
<i>And as you work on filling up
the rest of that book</i>

598
00:33:57,011 --> 00:34:00,022
<i>you'll eventually get to meet
your fan.</i>

599
00:34:00,023 --> 00:34:01,055
<i>Yes, that's right.</i>

600
00:34:01,159 --> 00:34:03,505
<i>The person to meet that girl and
take a picture together</i>

601
00:34:03,505 --> 00:34:05,980
<i>in order to complete that final page,
will be the ultimate winner for the day.</i>

602
00:34:05,981 --> 00:34:11,522
What's more important is that even though
we also got to meet Kwang Soo's father...

603
00:34:11,523 --> 00:34:13,870
today's victory will not have
anything to do with Kwang Soo.

604
00:34:13,871 --> 00:34:15,784
[We'll just assume that Kwang Soo
isn't going to be today's winner.]

605
00:34:15,785 --> 00:34:18,659
- But he knows the area very well.
- We're just here by chance.

606
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:21,789
When a celebrity usually
visits their hometown...

607
00:34:21,790 --> 00:34:23,943
they usually get a special episode
like this filmed in their honor.

608
00:34:23,943 --> 00:34:25,477
Kwang Soo's father is watching us right now.

609
00:34:25,477 --> 00:34:27,316
[He's watching...]

610
00:34:27,814 --> 00:34:31,253
-  Kwang Soo is...
- He's the star of the show today.

611
00:34:31,254 --> 00:34:33,032
You heard, right, Dad?

612
00:34:33,316 --> 00:34:35,188
- Kwang Soo is the star of the show today!
- Did you hear that?

613
00:34:35,189 --> 00:34:41,368
Lee Kwang Soo!
Lee Kwang Soo!

614
00:34:41,369 --> 00:34:43,618
- Let's ride the wave!
- Okay.

615
00:34:43,653 --> 00:34:44,971
One, two, three!

616
00:34:49,821 --> 00:34:51,432
Dad, I'm working right now.

617
00:34:52,352 --> 00:34:54,280
I'd like to add one more thing.

618
00:34:54,281 --> 00:34:58,106
That fan girl has no idea
that this is happening right now.

619
00:34:58,107 --> 00:35:00,127
- Seriously?
- No, she has no idea.

620
00:35:00,463 --> 00:35:02,686
- This will be a total surprise to her.
- She'll be so shocked.

621
00:35:02,687 --> 00:35:04,415
So we're going to have to find her.

622
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:06,602
There's a copy of the book
in these bags.

623
00:35:06,603 --> 00:35:09,122
[Everyone to head on their own separate ways
with a copy of the book in their bags.]

624
00:35:09,123 --> 00:35:10,734
There's also a camera in your bags.

625
00:35:10,735 --> 00:35:13,264
- Okay, the camera is in here.
- Everything is in here.

626
00:35:13,265 --> 00:35:14,626
Let's take this one.

627
00:35:15,453 --> 00:35:16,827
What's this?

628
00:35:17,277 --> 00:35:20,027
[These are the pictures that were
in the book the fan girl made.]

629
00:35:20,028 --> 00:35:22,936
[Pictures of various
different locales in Namyang?]

630
00:35:23,655 --> 00:35:25,238
What are you looking at?

631
00:35:25,239 --> 00:35:26,463
What is this?

632
00:35:26,464 --> 00:35:28,847
- Do we just pick one?
- Can we pick whichever one we want?

633
00:35:28,848 --> 00:35:31,549
[First mission- Take public transportation
to get to the place within the picture.]

634
00:35:31,550 --> 00:35:33,092
Han River Park.

635
00:35:33,093 --> 00:35:34,854
Sampae Earth.

636
00:35:35,989 --> 00:35:38,309
- Wabueup Office.
- Is it near here?

637
00:35:38,879 --> 00:35:42,332
If I have to take public transportation,
does it mean that my dad can give me a ride?

638
00:35:42,581 --> 00:35:44,201
That's such a great idea.

639
00:35:44,645 --> 00:35:46,508
This looks like a library.

640
00:35:47,158 --> 00:35:49,419
What is this place?

641
00:35:51,034 --> 00:35:52,877
- Hello!
- Hello.

642
00:35:53,895 --> 00:35:56,559
- Let's go together.
- What do you mean, go together?

643
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,554
- We're going to the same place anyway.
- Why would we go together?

644
00:35:59,144 --> 00:36:01,373
- Pyungnae Library, please.
- Pyungnae Library?

645
00:36:01,374 --> 00:36:02,983
- Do you know where it's at?
- Yes.

646
00:36:02,984 --> 00:36:07,868
- Sir, do you know Han River Public Park?
- How about Sampae Earth?

647
00:36:08,465 --> 00:36:13,226
- Dad, can you give me a ride?
- That's awesome.

648
00:36:13,227 --> 00:36:14,840
- That's so awesome.
- Okay.

649
00:36:15,717 --> 00:36:17,797
- Wow, what a good dad.
- Did he say he'll give you a ride?

650
00:36:17,798 --> 00:36:19,222
- Yes, he is.
- Yes.

651
00:36:19,223 --> 00:36:22,545
But since we have to take the VJ's,
I think only one of you'll be able to go.

652
00:36:22,546 --> 00:36:25,811
- Hey, I'll carry your camera.
- Yeah, he can be your camera man.

653
00:36:26,284 --> 00:36:29,273
[Thinking fast on his feet-
Haroro offers himself up for service.]

654
00:36:29,794 --> 00:36:33,841
I've always wondered who Kwang Soo took
after for him to be so handsome and sexy.

655
00:36:33,842 --> 00:36:35,817
But, now I see where he got it, Father.

656
00:36:46,155 --> 00:36:48,644
[What kind of a girl could the fan girl be?]

657
00:36:49,305 --> 00:36:52,509
She probably has no idea whatsoever
that we're on our way to find her right now.

658
00:36:52,782 --> 00:36:55,051
I'm so thankful for what
she did, aren't you?

659
00:36:56,403 --> 00:36:58,829
Father, you know how Kwang Soo is
making a pretty good living these days?

660
00:36:59,898 --> 00:37:03,071
But what's really shocking is...

661
00:37:03,072 --> 00:37:05,171
he bought you a new car last week.

662
00:37:06,273 --> 00:37:09,466
- What a good son!
- He's such a filial son!

663
00:37:09,467 --> 00:37:10,966
[Time to give Kwang Soo a bit
of a hard time.]

664
00:37:10,967 --> 00:37:13,291
He also bought two designer
handbags for his mother.

783
00:43:14,869 --> 00:43:18,274
- You read the book twice, right?
- Yes, I read it twice.

784

You have to know this answer, okay?

785
00:43:19,643 --> 00:43:22,592
In the very last page of the book...

786
00:43:24,063 --> 00:43:29,275
where is the place that Kong-ji
is seen standing with the officer?

787
00:43:29,276 --> 00:43:30,990
That's an easy question.

788
00:43:32,362 --> 00:43:34,161
- Where is this place?
- Is it an obvious place?

789
00:43:34,162 --> 00:43:36,046
Yes, it is.
There would be no doubt about it.

790
00:43:36,047 --> 00:43:38,108
- You read through it twice.
- I read through the book twice.

791
00:43:38,447 --> 00:43:40,127
It's in front of an octagonal pavilion.

792
00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:42,364
Or is it a hexagonal pavilion?

793

Please give me one more chance.

800
00:43:59,956 --> 00:44:02,131
- I see a door...
- I see water.

801
00:44:02,132 --> 00:44:03,778
And there's water.

802
00:44:07,407 --> 00:44:09,799

What do you mean, Ms. Kong-ji?
Are you two friends?

805
00:44:14,334 --> 00:44:15,922
[You must be on friendly terms with her.]

806
00:44:15,923 --> 00:44:17,112
Do you know who she is personally?

807
00:44:17,113 --> 00:44:19,758
She would be like my older sister.
She's been around for a long time.

808
00:44:19,759 --> 00:44:22,887
- Is it a bridge?
- Yes, it is a bridge.

809

Oh my gosh! It is the bridge!
I got it right!

810
00:44:25,476 --> 00:44:27,303
How could you not have
gotten that answer?

- Yes, we will.

Okay, let's start.

00:45:25,964 --> 00:45:28,182
[Expert steals Jong Kook's stapler.]

831
00:45:28,183 --> 00:45:30,904
You can't use mine!
You can't use my stapler!

832
00:45:30,905 --> 00:45:32,892
- You can't use my stapler!
- Done!

833
00:45:32,893 --> 00:45:34,770
No, you can't use my stapler!

834
00:45:34,771 --> 00:45:37,154
[Kwang Soo and Ha Ha
finish at the same time.]

835
00:45:38,072 --> 00:45:41,058
What are you doing?
You can't use my stapler!

836
00:45:41,059 --> 00:45:44,246
- Kwang Soo and I are finished.
- Kwang Soo took out her staples.

837
00:45:44,247 --> 00:45:46,183
[The director verifies that
Kwang Soo cheated.]

838
00:45:46,184 --> 00:45:49,528
- That's why she used mine.
- That's not such a huge deal.

839
00:45:49,529 --> 00:45:50,978
- That's not such a bad thing.
- Disqualified.

840
00:45:51,537 --> 00:45:54,470
[Kwang Soo is disqualified.
Ha Ha alone passes the mission.]

841
00:45:54,471 --> 00:45:56,361
I need to take a look!

842
00:45:56,362 --> 00:45:59,434
[Meanwhile, the Monday Couple is trying
to find their picture from the kite fliers.]

843
00:46:01,783 --> 00:46:04,564
It's another dud.
Here you go. Thank you.

844
00:46:05,604 --> 00:46:07,750
There are way too many kites.

845
00:46:11,750 --> 00:46:14,041
[Ace Ji Hyo seems to have
discovered something.]

846
00:46:16,131 --> 00:46:18,924
[Something on the kite being flown
by the man running around.]

847
00:46:18,925 --> 00:46:20,375
Sir!

848
00:46:20,376 --> 00:46:21,847
Just a minute.

849
00:46:24,369 --> 00:46:26,334
[Finally having caught up to the
suspicious kite flier.]

850
00:46:26,335 --> 00:46:28,532
Can I fly your kite for a minute?

851
00:46:32,194 --> 00:46:34,697
[Is there really a picture on the kite?]

852
00:46:42,773 --> 00:46:45,144
[It really is a picture!]

853
00:46:45,145 --> 00:46:46,242
What is this?

854
00:46:49,961 --> 00:46:54,767
[This is a picture that will bring
Ji Hyo one step closer to finding the girl!]

855
00:46:55,243 --> 00:46:57,396
[This picture alone isn't enough to
guide her to where she needs to go.]

856
00:46:58,105 --> 00:46:59,534
[Meanwhile...]

857
00:46:59,535 --> 00:47:01,795
- Is this supposed to be Ann?
- Yeah.

858
00:47:01,931 --> 00:47:03,827
[Next 'R' stickered book is,
'Redheaded Ann'.]

859
00:47:04,403 --> 00:47:06,149
What's the book about?

860
00:47:08,782 --> 00:47:10,806
It's a story about love.

861
00:47:13,341 --> 00:47:14,737
She cut her hair off.

862
00:47:14,738 --> 00:47:16,686
She cut her hair off?
Why cut it off?

863
00:47:16,687 --> 00:47:18,482
It doesn't say
which salon she went to, does it?

864
00:47:19,446 --> 00:47:22,021
No, it doesn't.
Come on! What are you doing?

865
00:47:23,810 --> 00:47:25,885
- We just need to look at the pictures.
- Yeah, just the pictures.

866
00:47:27,015 --> 00:47:28,920
There are two windows.

867
00:47:28,921 --> 00:47:31,693
[They're only looking at the pictures now
after the last batch of questions.]

868
00:47:32,474 --> 00:47:33,985
Who's the grandfather?

869
00:47:37,874 --> 00:47:40,867
[An immature fight that breaks out
right before the exam starts.]

870
00:47:42,133 --> 00:47:43,677
- Let me just take a quick look.
- No, you can't.

871
00:47:44,943 --> 00:47:46,863
What does this say?

872
00:47:46,864 --> 00:47:48,355
What is all this?

873
00:47:48,953 --> 00:47:50,973
- What did it say?
- Lucimon.

874
00:47:51,608 --> 00:47:52,772
Let me take a look.

875
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:55,000
[Time over]

876
00:47:55,001 --> 00:47:56,714
This is all just going to be guesswork.

877
00:47:57,951 --> 00:48:02,698
- You two just read the book, right?
- Yes, we read it.

878
00:48:02,699 --> 00:48:05,186
- Yes, we really enjoyed the book.
- Do we really need to read it like this?

879
00:48:06,848 --> 00:48:09,170
- This question is for the both of you.
- Okay.

880
00:48:09,538 --> 00:48:12,450
The first person to shout out the answer
gets it, okay?

881
00:48:12,875 --> 00:48:17,449
What is the name of
Ann's friend in the book?

882
00:48:17,450 --> 00:48:19,355
What is the name of her
friend in the book?

883
00:48:23,801 --> 00:48:25,467
Isn't there more to the question?

884
00:48:25,815 --> 00:48:28,301
- Can you tell me the answer?
- It's not a picture question?

885
00:48:29,562 --> 00:48:31,945
- We only looked at the pictures.
- We only studied the pictures.

886
00:48:31,946 --> 00:48:33,635
We only looked at the pictures.

887
00:48:33,636 --> 00:48:37,257
- We only studied the pictures.
- What is the name of Anne's friend?

888
00:48:38,053 --> 00:48:40,017
I just told you that we only
looked at the pictures.

889
00:48:40,018 --> 00:48:42,012
You have to ask us about the flowers.

890
00:48:42,013 --> 00:48:45,441
- There are four flowers.
- There's a page with 20 flowers on it too.

891
00:48:45,442 --> 00:48:46,905
What are you doing?

892
00:48:47,561 --> 00:48:50,321
There are only six characters
in the book.

893
00:48:52,119 --> 00:48:53,317
Seriously.

894
00:48:53,318 --> 00:48:56,249
[There aren't even that many characters,
but you only looked at the pictures...]

895
00:48:56,250 --> 00:48:59,065
[You shouldn't have
just looked at the pictures.]

896
00:48:59,675 --> 00:49:04,217
[Correct answer- Diana.]

897
00:49:04,218 --> 00:49:08,285
[It's quite an easy answer to find.]

898
00:49:08,286 --> 00:49:11,131
- Natasha?
- It's not Natasha.

899
00:49:11,132 --> 00:49:13,589
[Her only friend is from Eastern Europe?]

900
00:49:13,590 --> 00:49:14,698
Which country is that book from?

901
00:49:14,699 --> 00:49:16,934
It's not from Russia?

902
00:49:17,924 --> 00:49:20,046
In the book, 'Heunbujeon'...

903
00:49:20,047 --> 00:49:21,168
This is a very easy question.

904
00:49:21,169 --> 00:49:27,448
Where did the couple plant the seed
that the bird brought them?

905
00:49:27,449 --> 00:49:28,563
Answer.

906
00:49:28,564 --> 00:49:29,968
On the roof.

907
00:49:29,969 --> 00:49:31,699
No, that's incorrect.

908
00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:36,309
[Correct answer- By the fence.]

909
00:49:40,306 --> 00:49:43,489
[Shutting Jae Suk's mouth out of fear
that he'll answer it correctly.]

910
00:49:43,490 --> 00:49:45,285
I think you were about to
give the right answer.

911
00:49:46,061 --> 00:49:47,467
What is it?

912
00:49:48,543 --> 00:49:50,052
By the well.

913
00:49:56,479 --> 00:49:58,066
Want to give the answer
that I was about to give?

914
00:50:00,343 --> 00:50:02,666
- What the heck is that?
- You never know.

915
00:50:02,667 --> 00:50:04,996
- Really? Back in those times?
- You never know what they could've had.

916
00:50:04,997 --> 00:50:07,376
[Just what is the answer that he told you?]

917
00:50:07,377 --> 00:50:08,747
By the faucet?

918
00:50:08,748 --> 00:50:10,126
That isn't it.

919
00:50:10,127 --> 00:50:12,826
[This is the Joseon times.
Faucets didn't exist.]

920
00:50:13,104 --> 00:50:17,209
They needed to have pipes, and
where would they have gotten the faucet?

921
00:50:17,210 --> 00:50:20,896
They could've had a faucet back then.

922
00:50:20,897 --> 00:50:22,358
This isn't going right.

923
00:50:22,359 --> 00:50:24,207
Just what is the correct answer?

924
00:50:24,208 --> 00:50:27,764
- You looked like you had it. It's the fence.
- Ah, the fence!

925
00:50:29,944 --> 00:50:32,583
You only have one chance
to answer the next question.

926
00:50:33,038 --> 00:50:34,680
Just one chance?
Only one of us?

927
00:50:34,681 --> 00:50:35,920
Okay.

928
00:50:36,202 --> 00:50:40,643
- How many birds are on page 19?
- Answer!

929
00:50:43,204 --> 00:50:48,171
[The correct answer is... four!]

930
00:50:48,492 --> 00:50:49,820
[Jae Suk shouts out with confidence.]

931
00:50:49,821 --> 00:50:51,138
Four.

932
00:50:51,139 --> 00:50:52,439
Four.

933
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:55,368
If I get this right, then
Suk Jin has to buy our lunch, right?

934
00:50:55,369 --> 00:50:57,927
But if I get it right,
then he has to buy, right?

935
00:50:58,555 --> 00:50:59,591
Please.

936
00:51:00,384 --> 00:51:02,662
[Jae Suk answers it correctly.]

937
00:51:04,339 --> 00:51:05,735
[Jae Suk succeeds the book mission.]

938
00:51:05,736 --> 00:51:07,984
Who would've ever thought that I'd lose
over the number of the birds?

939
00:51:08,923 --> 00:51:10,695
- What is this place?
- What is it?

940
00:51:10,696 --> 00:51:12,315
Is this where we need to go next?

941
00:51:13,144 --> 00:51:14,185
Alpine Federation?

942
00:51:14,534 --> 00:51:16,783
I think I saw this earlier.

943
00:51:17,577 --> 00:51:21,067
[Ha Ha is already on his way to figuring out
where his next destination will be.]

944
00:51:21,068 --> 00:51:22,331
What could this be?

945
00:51:22,689 --> 00:51:25,004
It looks like some wall climbing place.

946
00:51:26,611 --> 00:51:27,837
Sir.

947
00:51:27,838 --> 00:51:31,715
Can I ask you a question?
Would you know where this place is?

948
00:51:32,195 --> 00:51:34,362
[Will he know where this place is?]

949
00:51:34,363 --> 00:51:37,842
Is this the Alpine Federation in Namyang?

950
00:51:38,812 --> 00:51:42,750
It looks like some kind of a statue.
Can you tell me where this place is?

951
00:51:47,405 --> 00:51:49,661
Nothing like this exists around here.

952
00:51:50,553 --> 00:51:51,911
- You don't know?
- No, I don't.

953
00:51:54,744 --> 00:51:57,402
- In Namyang? Ah!
- What?

954
00:51:57,403 --> 00:51:59,147
- It's the athletic field.
- The athletic field?

955
00:51:59,888 --> 00:52:02,284
- That's right.
- What's the place called?

956
00:52:02,285 --> 00:52:06,154
- It's the Namyang Grand Athletic Field.
-  Namyang Grand Athletic Field?

957
00:52:06,558 --> 00:52:08,354
Thank you so much.
Thank you!

958
00:52:08,355 --> 00:52:11,311
[Succeeds in figuring out
his next destination!]

959
00:52:13,135 --> 00:52:16,224
[Gary's also in the process of asking
where his next destination is.]

960
00:52:16,225 --> 00:52:19,762
[Gary also figures out that he needs to go to
Namyang Grand Athletic Field.]

961
00:52:20,168 --> 00:52:22,006
That's the rock climbing wall.

962
00:52:22,007 --> 00:52:23,908
Ah, this is the rock climbing wall?

963
00:52:23,909 --> 00:52:26,876
[Also figures out that it's a
rock climbing structure.]

964
00:52:26,877 --> 00:52:28,751
Yes, you're right.

965
00:52:28,752 --> 00:52:30,201
Thank you.

966
00:52:31,061 --> 00:52:34,458
[Ji Hyo and Gary heading out together
to Namyang Grand Athletic Field.]

967
00:52:35,325 --> 00:52:36,519
It has to be the place, right?

968
00:52:37,972 --> 00:52:40,569
She wrote that it's a place that she'd
always walk by on her way to school.

969
00:52:40,570 --> 00:52:45,793
[Referring back to the book in their bags.]

970
00:52:47,021 --> 00:52:50,578
- I don't know anything about this area.
- It must be nice for Kwang Soo.

971
00:52:50,579 --> 00:52:52,934
I bet he knows the area really well
since he grew up around here.

972
00:52:53,342 --> 00:52:56,120
[And the prodigy of Namyang...]

973
00:52:56,121 --> 00:52:59,778
[Is stuck and isn't able to budge
from being detained by the Tiger.]

974
00:53:02,252 --> 00:53:05,041
[Giraffe is 70% topless,
trying to make his escape.]

975
00:53:05,042 --> 00:53:06,929
Why are you taking off you shirt?

976
00:53:08,977 --> 00:53:11,671
[Tiger attempting to skin the Giraffe.]

977
00:53:12,963 --> 00:53:15,477
Thanks for lunch, Suk Jin.

978
00:53:16,351 --> 00:53:18,673
- You have to pay the cab fare, okay?
- Don't even worry about it.

979
00:53:18,674 --> 00:53:22,703
Let's not make bets like that anymore.
I don't even have any money for the cab fare.

980
00:53:22,704 --> 00:53:24,968
[Jae Suk and Suk Jin approaching
Namyang Grand Athletic Field.]

981
00:53:25,731 --> 00:53:27,231
I doubt anyone's there already.

982
00:53:27,883 --> 00:53:30,922
- There it is. It's just like the picture.
- I see it too.

983
00:53:31,565 --> 00:53:34,757
Isn't that a rock climbing wall?
Are you going to have to climb?

984
00:53:34,758 --> 00:53:36,653
- No way.
- That's a rock climbing wall?

985
00:53:37,675 --> 00:53:39,752
They're not expecting us
to climb up there, are they?

986
00:53:46,649 --> 00:53:51,726
[Namyang Rock Climbing Wall.]

987
00:53:52,609 --> 00:53:54,676
- This is it.
- It's the same thing.

988
00:53:55,447 --> 00:53:56,937
It's exactly the same.

989
00:53:56,938 --> 00:53:59,917
[A perfect match to the picture.]

990
00:54:01,531 --> 00:54:05,088
[It's none other than a place where
the fan girl likes to exercise.]

991
00:54:05,089 --> 00:54:07,172
[At the height of 15m, their
heads automatically tip back to see.]

992
00:54:07,173 --> 00:54:08,264
Look at this.

993
00:54:08,265 --> 00:54:10,972
[Their own personal equipment
is arranged next to one another.]

994
00:54:11,897 --> 00:54:13,221
Oh my goodness.

995
00:54:13,721 --> 00:54:15,592
Wow, seriously?

996
00:54:15,593 --> 00:54:17,220
What do they expect us to do?

997
00:54:18,499 --> 00:54:21,887
[Haroro also arrives.]

998
00:54:22,433 --> 00:54:24,254
There's a balloon up there.

999
00:54:24,255 --> 00:54:28,434
It's telling us that if we want a better
hint, we need to climb up higher.

1000
00:54:28,435 --> 00:54:29,874
['High' and 'Low' balloon.]

1001
00:54:31,714 --> 00:54:33,495
What are we expected to do here?

1002
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:41,689
You'll find envelopes that contain a picture
behind those low, middle, and high balloons.

1003
00:54:42,031 --> 00:54:47,035
There's a huge difference between the
hints for those three pictures.

1004
00:54:47,036 --> 00:54:48,589
They're quite different.

1005
00:54:48,590 --> 00:54:50,702
Therefore, we encourage you to
go after the higher ones.

1006
00:54:50,703 --> 00:54:53,062
Can we go for something lower if we decide
that we can't go for the higher one?

1007
00:54:53,063 --> 00:54:55,518
Yes, but you have to get on a different line,
so you have to come back down first.

1008
00:54:55,519 --> 00:54:57,994
- We have to come back down?
- We have to decide before we go up.

1009
00:54:57,995 --> 00:55:01,045
- I'm going for the middle.
- I'm going for the middle too.

1010
00:55:01,046 --> 00:55:02,753
[They each select their hints to go after.]

1011
00:55:02,754 --> 00:55:04,753
- This is...
- Wow, this is seriously.

1012
00:55:05,725 --> 00:55:08,853
- Should I just go for the low one?
- Did you pick one?

1013
00:55:09,448 --> 00:55:13,173
- Maybe we should stretch out first.
- That won't do anything for me.

1014
00:55:13,817 --> 00:55:16,397
[Climb!]

1015
00:55:17,783 --> 00:55:23,280
[Suk Jin and Gary going for the 'High',
and Jae Suk and Ji Hyo going for the 'Mid'.]

1016
00:55:25,886 --> 00:55:28,106
- This is so scary!
- I don't think I can do this!

1017
00:55:36,876 --> 00:55:38,606
This is so scary!

1018
00:55:38,607 --> 00:55:40,254
This is absurd!
Hang on!

1019
00:55:41,294 --> 00:55:44,568
- Are you sure this won't fall off?
- It's not going to fall off.

1020
00:55:46,296 --> 00:55:48,574
How am I ever going to go up that high?
I think that I was being too greedy.

1021
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:58,043
[Amazing-
A rock climbing grasshopper.]

1022
00:55:58,044 --> 00:55:59,816
Look at Jae Suk.
That's unbelievable.

1023
00:56:02,387 --> 00:56:04,968
[Almost there!]

1024
00:56:06,176 --> 00:56:09,542
[Climbing fearlessly up the wall!]

1025
00:56:09,892 --> 00:56:12,476
[Yoo-piderman!]

1026
00:56:12,477 --> 00:56:13,660
I'm so scared.

1027
00:56:19,354 --> 00:56:21,859
[Finds the envelope containing the hint.]

1028
00:56:21,860 --> 00:56:25,210
[The 'Mid' hint.]

1029
00:56:25,211 --> 00:56:26,360
Down!

1030
00:56:26,361 --> 00:56:28,420
Just take your hands off.

1031
00:56:30,838 --> 00:56:37,055
[Barely... makes his descent.]

1032
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:46,928
[Beats his fear of heights to
be the first one to succeed.]

1033
00:56:48,382 --> 00:56:49,651
Hang on!

1034
00:56:50,533 --> 00:56:53,040
[His legs giving up on him.]

1035
00:56:53,872 --> 00:56:55,656
There's nothing for me to grab onto!

1036
00:56:57,502 --> 00:57:00,192
No!
I don't have anything to grab onto!

1037
00:57:01,692 --> 00:57:04,942
[Blank Ji making her way upward.]

1038
00:57:04,943 --> 00:57:07,489
[Arrives midway.]

1039
00:57:07,490 --> 00:57:08,987
I got it!

1040
00:57:08,988 --> 00:57:10,675
Descent!

1041
00:57:13,956 --> 00:57:15,989
Do you find that fun?

1042
00:57:18,048 --> 00:57:20,753
[Blank Ji lightly making her way down.]

1043
00:57:22,791 --> 00:57:24,926
How can she think that's fun?

1044
00:57:28,765 --> 00:57:30,874
Suk Jin!
Why did you pick the high one?

1045
00:57:36,988 --> 00:57:39,050
Wait!
Wait a minute!

1046
00:57:42,114 --> 00:57:45,651
[Oh... Gary!]

1047
00:57:47,143 --> 00:57:50,618
[Arrives at the highest hint.]

1048
00:57:51,722 --> 00:57:54,718
[Gae-piderman arrives at
the highest balloon.]

1049
00:57:59,332 --> 00:58:02,770
[Gets his hand on the highest hint.]

1050
00:58:02,771 --> 00:58:04,132
Descent!

1051
00:58:06,442 --> 00:58:09,485
Ji Hyo, you should've gone
for the high one.

1052
00:58:09,486 --> 00:58:11,103
[Easily makes his way back down.]

1053
00:58:11,104 --> 00:58:13,183
- Suk Jin!
- I'm so scared.

1054
00:58:13,871 --> 00:58:15,838
- Suk Jin!
- Yeah?

1055
00:58:16,388 --> 00:58:19,478
- I brought a middle hint down.
- Yeah?

1056
00:58:19,479 --> 00:58:22,282
Why don't you take my hint,
and I'll go for your high hint?

1057
00:58:22,283 --> 00:58:24,549
- Seriously?
- Yeah, you can take this one.

1058
00:58:24,550 --> 00:58:27,283
- Ji Hyo, I love you!
- Here you go!

1059
00:58:28,024 --> 00:58:31,603
[Fearless Ji Hyo offers to go back up
for Suk Jin's high hint.]

1060
00:58:31,604 --> 00:58:34,102
- What's there to be scared about?
- You don't find that scary?

1061
00:58:34,806 --> 00:58:36,587
Descent!

1062
00:58:36,588 --> 00:58:39,100
- Descent!
- Descent!

1063
00:58:39,101 --> 00:58:41,486
- Let go.
- Let go!

1064
00:58:41,487 --> 00:58:43,488
- I can't let go!
- Let go!

1065
00:58:44,091 --> 00:58:46,628
- Suk Jin, let go!
- I can't! I'll just go back down.

1066
00:58:46,629 --> 00:58:48,734
- No, you can't.
- I'll just come back down.

1067
00:58:49,795 --> 00:58:52,208
- Let go!
- You just need to let go!

1068
00:58:52,209 --> 00:58:54,393
I can't!
I don't trust that guy!

1069
00:58:54,758 --> 00:58:57,339
- Just let go!
- I can't let go!

1070
00:58:58,254 --> 00:58:59,912
- Just let go!
- How can I let go!

1071
00:58:59,913 --> 00:59:01,622
Take your hands off of the wall!

1072
00:59:01,623 --> 00:59:03,155
Are you crazy?

1073
00:59:04,493 --> 00:59:06,520
- Grab the rope!
- I'll just come back down.

1074
00:59:06,521 --> 00:59:09,188
[Just keeps on insisting
that he'll come back down.]

1075
00:59:09,189 --> 00:59:11,236
Grab the rope in front of you!

1076
00:59:11,237 --> 00:59:13,414
- What if the rope breaks?
- It's not going to break.

1077
00:59:18,342 --> 00:59:21,761
Wait!
Wait, wait a minute!

1078
00:59:23,570 --> 00:59:27,018
- Seriously, Suk Jin.
- I understand what he must be feeling.

1079
00:59:27,765 --> 00:59:29,772
Okay, I've let go.

1080
00:59:29,773 --> 00:59:31,910
[After all the screaming...]

1081
00:59:31,911 --> 00:59:34,580
[Finally makes his way back down.]

1082
00:59:35,340 --> 00:59:37,351
You're doing it too fast.
Slow down.

1083
00:59:37,352 --> 00:59:39,024
Please slow it down.

1084
00:59:39,025 --> 00:59:40,872
Please.

1085
00:59:42,818 --> 00:59:46,222
[Finally back on the ground.]

1086
00:59:46,223 --> 00:59:47,804
- Where is it, Ji Hyo.
- Here you go.

1087
00:59:47,805 --> 00:59:49,428
- Thanks.
- You're really going back up there?

1088
00:59:49,429 --> 00:59:51,425
Don't you know how high up that is?

1089
00:59:52,442 --> 00:59:57,446
- Don't you have any fear?
- There is a difference between the hints?

1090
00:59:57,447 --> 00:59:58,691
- Yes, there's a huge difference.
- Really?

1091
00:59:58,692 --> 01:00:00,081
There is a tremendous difference.

1092
01:00:00,082 --> 01:00:02,645
I don't think I can do this.
I'm so terrified.

1093
01:00:02,646 --> 01:00:04,267
You can't look down.

1094
01:00:04,579 --> 01:00:07,124
I'm only able to say this because
I'm back down on the ground.

1095
01:00:08,716 --> 01:00:10,527
That's what I realized when I got back down.

1096
01:00:11,393 --> 01:00:13,663
What are you going to do?
Are you going to go up or down?

1097
01:00:13,664 --> 01:00:15,415
- Me?
- Yes.

1098
01:00:15,986 --> 01:00:17,963
Should I go for the low one?

1099
01:00:18,281 --> 01:00:20,929
Why are you even making us do this?

1100
01:00:24,753 --> 01:00:27,900
- Look at Song Ji Hyo up there.
- She's already almost there.

1101
01:00:28,296 --> 01:00:31,511
[Fearless Blank Ji steadily making
her way up to the top.]

1102
01:00:35,167 --> 01:00:39,326
- I feel like I'm going to fall off!
- Look at Song Ji Hyo climb up there.

1103
01:00:39,945 --> 01:00:41,936
Look at Song Ji Hyo up there.

1104
01:00:42,611 --> 01:00:46,731
- There's no spot for me to grab onto!
- Song Ji Hyo! What are you made of?

1105
01:00:46,766 --> 01:00:48,825
If you think you don't have anything to grab,
you should take a look at Song Ji Hyo.

1106
01:00:48,826 --> 01:00:51,364
- Song Ji Hyo, are you the Spiderman?
- Your left foot!

1107
01:00:51,365 --> 01:00:52,684
Hang on a second.

1108
01:00:52,685 --> 01:00:55,000
No!
You can't fall down!

1109
01:00:56,018 --> 01:00:57,776
No!

1110
01:00:57,777 --> 01:01:00,346
- Don't give up!
- You're there!

1111
01:01:00,347 --> 01:01:01,996
[Wow... arrives at the highest balloon.]

1112
01:01:01,997 --> 01:01:03,312
She seriously is...

1113
01:01:03,313 --> 01:01:06,438
[Wins herself the high hint envelope.]

1114
01:01:06,439 --> 01:01:08,004
Ha Ha!
Look at what Ji Hyo's doing.

1115
01:01:08,005 --> 01:01:10,230
[Huh?
He's going for the low hint?]

1116
01:01:14,046 --> 01:01:16,602
- Why are you going for the low hint?
- That was really hard.

1117
01:01:17,469 --> 01:01:19,594
- Wow, this really was very hard.
- Ha Ha, you're seriously...

1118
01:01:19,595 --> 01:01:20,736
Descent!

1119
01:01:25,909 --> 01:01:28,180
Ji Hyo!
No, Ji Hyo!

1120
01:01:32,010 --> 01:01:33,838
I did it!
I'm satisfied with this.

1121
01:01:33,839 --> 01:01:35,395
I did it!

1122
01:01:36,908 --> 01:01:39,118
I thought I was going to die up there.
I can't believe I did it!

1123
01:01:39,783 --> 01:01:42,349
[All in a day's work for Ji Hyo.]

1124
01:01:44,172 --> 01:01:46,834
[Yoo Hyuk checking his mid hint.]

1125
01:01:47,566 --> 01:01:50,936
[A park?
Someone filming something?]

1126
01:01:51,262 --> 01:01:54,492
I don't even know what it is with my hint,
so there's no way for you to know what it is.

1127
01:01:54,882 --> 01:01:57,515
But we can join our heads
and work together on this.

1128
01:02:03,049 --> 01:02:05,228
I think we can just follow the others
with the high hint.

1129
01:02:05,229 --> 01:02:06,562
Okay.

1130
01:02:06,982 --> 01:02:09,754
[Their plan is to follow the ones
who gained the high hint.]

1131
01:02:11,742 --> 01:02:14,193
[Gary checking his high hint.]

1132
01:02:16,541 --> 01:02:18,644
[An apartment building?]

1133
01:02:19,531 --> 01:02:22,266
[Is this where the fan girl lives?]

1134
01:02:22,267 --> 01:02:23,792
<i>[My house.]</i>

1135
01:02:23,793 --> 01:02:25,387
This is...

1136
01:02:26,081 --> 01:02:27,684
This hint is unbelievable.

1137
01:02:30,478 --> 01:02:34,190
- Isn't this a rock climbing wall?
- It's rock climbing.

1138
01:02:34,191 --> 01:02:35,998
Isn't that Jae Suk?

1139
01:02:36,570 --> 01:02:38,166
Maybe he just got here too.

1140
01:02:38,167 --> 01:02:40,320
[What do you mean, just got here?
He's about to leave.]

1141
01:02:40,321 --> 01:02:41,864
- Where is he going?
- Jae Suk!

1142
01:02:42,397 --> 01:02:44,128
- Jae Suk!
- Jae Suk, where are you going?

1143
01:02:44,750 --> 01:02:46,875
- What took you guys so long?
- Where are you going?

1144
01:02:46,876 --> 01:02:49,320
- Where are you going?
- We're going to the next location.

1145
01:02:49,321 --> 01:02:51,034
- You're already done?
- Of course, we're done.

1146
01:02:51,035 --> 01:02:54,110
- How can you be finished already?
- Just go and do your mission.

1147
01:02:54,111 --> 01:02:56,668
- Don't go and just stay with us.
- Just go and do your mission.

1148
01:02:56,669 --> 01:02:58,596
- Just go and do your thing.
- Why are you locking your door?

1149
01:03:00,914 --> 01:03:03,790
Once Gary gets in his taxi,
can you follow it?

1150
01:03:03,791 --> 01:03:05,558
[His plan is to follow Gary
to his next destination.]

1151
01:03:05,559 --> 01:03:06,923
There he is.

1152
01:03:07,886 --> 01:03:09,498
Please follow his taxi.

1153
01:03:09,499 --> 01:03:10,911
Thank you.

1154
01:03:12,878 --> 01:03:14,029
Sir.

1155
01:03:14,608 --> 01:03:16,842
I need to get to this building.

1156
01:03:16,843 --> 01:03:21,171
I don't know which apartment
building it is.

1157
01:03:22,478 --> 01:03:28,080
[At a closer look,
they can see some street signs.]

1158
01:03:28,081 --> 01:03:30,144
- I think I got it.
- You know where it is?

1159
01:03:31,713 --> 01:03:34,972
It looks like they're filming something.

1160
01:03:34,973 --> 01:03:37,891
- Could it be a drama shoot?
- I'm not sure.

1161
01:03:39,529 --> 01:03:42,346
This won't do.
He said there's a huge difference.

1162
01:03:42,347 --> 01:03:44,448
I think I should follow Ji Hyo's car
when she gets on the road.

1163
01:03:47,683 --> 01:03:50,717
[Only one mid and low hint are left.]

1164
01:03:50,718 --> 01:03:52,158
How are you so high up there already?

1165
01:03:53,050 --> 01:03:54,604
- Jong Kook.
- Yeah?

1166
01:03:59,712 --> 01:04:01,800
[Take that!]

1167
01:04:04,303 --> 01:04:08,272
- Why are you coming up my way?
- I have to get the mid hint.

1168
01:04:08,273 --> 01:04:09,730
You have to go after your own.

1169
01:04:09,731 --> 01:04:11,174
Are you already up there?

1170
01:04:11,484 --> 01:04:14,001
[Giraffe is almost to his mid hint.]

1171
01:04:15,763 --> 01:04:17,392
Then I'm just going to go back down.

1172
01:04:17,999 --> 01:04:19,264
Like this?

1173
01:04:19,265 --> 01:04:21,608
[Kkuk is making his way back down
from having no other choice.]

1174
01:04:23,460 --> 01:04:26,296
[Giraffe wins himself the mid hint.]

1175
01:04:33,817 --> 01:04:35,337
Help me!

1176
01:04:35,338 --> 01:04:36,925
I dropped my balloon!

1177
01:04:36,926 --> 01:04:39,526
Just let go of the wall
and grab the balloon.

1178
01:04:40,175 --> 01:04:41,717
You want me to let go?

1179
01:04:42,086 --> 01:04:43,972
How am I to let go?

1180
01:04:43,973 --> 01:04:47,627
[Frozen in his awkward stance.]

1181
01:04:49,770 --> 01:04:52,170
[Barely manages to rescue his balloon.]

1182
01:04:52,171 --> 01:04:53,600
Please.

1183
01:04:58,564 --> 01:05:00,122
Slow down!

1184
01:05:00,546 --> 01:05:01,850
Slow down!

1185
01:05:05,198 --> 01:05:07,262
[The envelope containing his hint!]

1186
01:05:11,311 --> 01:05:12,868
I'm all done.

1187
01:05:12,869 --> 01:05:14,785
What are you doing!

1188
01:05:14,786 --> 01:05:16,963
[Lucky enough to find the hint
that fell out of the sky.]

1189
01:05:16,964 --> 01:05:19,532
What are you doing?
Untie me!

1190
01:05:19,533 --> 01:05:21,563
- Help me!
- I'm all done here.

1191
01:05:21,564 --> 01:05:23,028
- Wait!
- I'm leaving!

1192
01:05:23,029 --> 01:05:24,849
- Thanks, Kwang Soo.
- Don't do this!

1193
01:05:26,397 --> 01:05:28,605
- Thanks, Kwang Soo.
- Come on, Jong Kook.

1194
01:05:28,606 --> 01:05:30,881
Come on!
What are you doing!

1195
01:05:30,882 --> 01:05:32,711
See you later, Kwang Soo.

1196
01:05:32,712 --> 01:05:34,136
Call the police!

1197
01:05:34,137 --> 01:05:35,328
Wait!

1198
01:05:36,380 --> 01:05:39,696
[Bye, Giraffe.]

1199
01:05:42,574 --> 01:05:45,767
He shouldn't have beat me up there.
He should've waited for me.

1200
01:05:50,004 --> 01:05:51,800
There's still one low hint
left up there.

1201
01:05:52,298 --> 01:05:54,130
[One lonely low hint left up
on the wall.]

1202
01:05:54,796 --> 01:05:56,554
Fine, let's just do this.

1203
01:05:58,187 --> 01:06:01,128
[Blank Ji with her high hint.]

1204
01:06:01,129 --> 01:06:02,770
Building eight.

1205
01:06:02,771 --> 01:06:05,085
- I think that's in Deokso.
- In Deokso?

1206
01:06:05,086 --> 01:06:08,078
Are there a lot of apartment buildings
that look like this in Deokso?

1207
01:06:09,408 --> 01:06:11,672
Ji Hyo knows where she's going,
doesn't she?

1208
01:06:11,673 --> 01:06:13,517
I doubt she's just going aimlessly, right?

1209
01:06:13,518 --> 01:06:15,908
This is the real chase.

1210
01:06:18,412 --> 01:06:20,371
I feel like we're in a movie.

1211
01:06:21,974 --> 01:06:25,559
[Jae Suk is also secretly chasing after
Gary and his better hint.]

1212
01:06:27,724 --> 01:06:30,860
Wow, I can't believe the difference
between the hints.

1213
01:06:30,861 --> 01:06:33,780
Wow, she lives on the top floor,
which makes it easier for us to find her.

1214
01:06:33,781 --> 01:06:35,090
So that's where she lives.

1215
01:06:35,528 --> 01:06:39,367
[Born in July of 1998.]

1216
01:06:39,368 --> 01:06:42,180
Do you know which middle schools
are in that area?

1217
01:06:42,181 --> 01:06:45,352
- There's Shimsa Middle School.
- Is it for girls?

1218
01:06:45,353 --> 01:06:47,765
It's a school for both boys and girls.

1219
01:06:50,045 --> 01:06:55,335
[Born in July of 1998.
A student at a middle school in Deokso?]

1220
01:06:55,336 --> 01:07:00,814
[Lives in an apartment in
the Deokso area.]

1221
01:07:01,366 --> 01:07:03,454
[Kkuk checking out his mid hint.]

1222
01:07:03,455 --> 01:07:04,922
What is this?

1223
01:07:05,666 --> 01:07:09,303
[One of the hint pictures is
of a movie poster?]

1224
01:07:10,998 --> 01:07:13,265
Could it be a movie theater?
'Hide and go seek'...

1225
01:07:13,689 --> 01:07:15,795
'Do you like scary ghost stories?'

1226
01:07:15,796 --> 01:07:18,564
[Re-reading through her notes.]

1227
01:07:19,135 --> 01:07:22,891
[Could this be the place?]

1228
01:07:23,621 --> 01:07:26,296
Will you please take me to
Gildong Elementary School?

1229
01:07:26,898 --> 01:07:29,277
[But that's back in Seoul?]

1230
01:07:35,568 --> 01:07:38,448
[Where is he going?]

1231
01:07:42,155 --> 01:07:45,582
Those squares and circles on the roof...
Yes, I think this is the place.

1232
01:07:46,477 --> 01:07:49,362
[He seems to have made it to the
right apartment complex?]

1233
01:07:49,363 --> 01:07:50,842
Yes, this is the place.

1234
01:07:51,470 --> 01:07:54,233
[Discovers an apartment building that looks
identical to the one in the picture!]

1235
01:08:00,061 --> 01:08:02,065
That's it!
That's the house!

1236
01:08:03,045 --> 01:08:04,241
There it is!

1237
01:08:04,242 --> 01:08:06,476
That's the place!
Driver, we've found the place!

1238
01:08:08,257 --> 01:08:13,675
[A match!]

1239
01:08:13,676 --> 01:08:16,145
- Thank you.
- Yes, thank you very much.

1240
01:08:16,146 --> 01:08:17,487
[Gary is the first one to arrive.]

1241
01:08:21,067 --> 01:08:24,040
[Yoo Hyuk having followed
Gary all the way here.]

1242
01:08:24,041 --> 01:08:26,263
I think we're on our way to
the girl's house.

1243
01:08:27,185 --> 01:08:29,087
Or is this a location of a film shoot?

1244
01:08:29,088 --> 01:08:31,926
[Even though he followed him here,
he still has no idea where he's going.]

1245
01:08:36,968 --> 01:08:38,932
It's one of those buildings.

1246
01:08:38,933 --> 01:08:41,181
I think you can just drop me off here.

1247
01:08:41,182 --> 01:08:44,528
[Ji Hyo also arrives at the apartment.]

1248
01:08:44,529 --> 01:08:47,047
Okay, we're here.
How much is the fare?

1249
01:08:47,048 --> 01:08:48,568
[Big-nose Brother also arrives.]

1250
01:08:52,120 --> 01:08:53,971
[Which one is it?]

1251
01:08:59,401 --> 01:09:00,925
Here.
This is the place.

1252
01:09:00,926 --> 01:09:04,510
Okay, this is good.
I can see Suk Jin up there.

1253
01:09:04,511 --> 01:09:06,126
[Ro-Ro gets lucky and sees Suk Jin.]

1254
01:09:06,127 --> 01:09:08,556
- I'll show everyone the power of Namyang!
- Okay, fighting!

1255
01:09:08,557 --> 01:09:10,446
- Do you have a car?
- Yes.

1256
01:09:10,447 --> 01:09:12,614
Then can you give me a ride to this place?

1257
01:09:12,615 --> 01:09:15,186
I don't know where that place is.

1258
01:09:15,187 --> 01:09:16,933
- Okay, let's go.
- Thank you.

1259
01:09:17,580 --> 01:09:18,968
Thank you.

1260
01:09:18,969 --> 01:09:21,374
[But he's lucky enough to hitch a ride.]

1261
01:09:21,375 --> 01:09:24,161
Is there a school nearby this picture?
Would you know where this is?

1262
01:09:25,097 --> 01:09:27,734
If you keep on going a bit further,
there should be another school.

1263
01:09:29,675 --> 01:09:32,069
Jong Kook... you're going to get it.

1264
01:09:33,558 --> 01:09:34,895
Excuse me.

1265
01:09:34,896 --> 01:09:36,575
- Do you live here?
- Yes.

1266
01:09:37,324 --> 01:09:39,594
Can you help me out with something?

1267
01:09:41,432 --> 01:09:44,487
Would you happen to know
where this building is?

1268
01:09:45,798 --> 01:09:49,109
- This is the building right up front.
- Seriously?

1269
01:09:49,110 --> 01:09:51,030
That's the building right up there.

1270
01:09:51,031 --> 01:09:53,622
[Right nearby!]

1271
01:09:53,623 --> 01:09:55,348
- There it is!
- I think that's the building.

1272
01:09:55,852 --> 01:09:59,466
Thank you so much!
See this structure right here?

1273
01:10:01,114 --> 01:10:03,918
And this is the building that she indicated
as being her house.

1274
01:10:03,919 --> 01:10:06,584
[That's the place!]

1275
01:10:07,936 --> 01:10:09,886
I wonder which apartment number that is.

1276
01:10:10,632 --> 01:10:12,944
Hello. Ma'am, do you
know which number this is?

1277
01:10:12,945 --> 01:10:15,717
[Showing all the neighbors the hint picture.]

1278
01:10:15,718 --> 01:10:18,918
- That's apartment 101.
- That one?

1279
01:10:20,064 --> 01:10:22,101
[The next building!]

1280
01:10:23,160 --> 01:10:24,910
[Is this the place?]

1281
01:10:29,128 --> 01:10:31,908
[Gary and Blank Ji storm the
front entrance!]

1282
01:10:34,340 --> 01:10:35,697
Jae Suk.

1283
01:10:36,477 --> 01:10:37,977
Where are you, Kwang Soo?

1284
01:10:37,978 --> 01:10:41,328
We don't even need to drag this out.
Let's just meet up and talk.

1285
01:10:41,329 --> 01:10:42,608
Where are you right now?

1286
01:10:42,609 --> 01:10:45,277
I'm right by the apartment complex area.

1287
01:10:49,686 --> 01:10:52,338
[The exact same street
as the one in the picture!]

1288
01:10:52,339 --> 01:10:54,239
- I'm right by the complex.
- Me too.

1289
01:10:56,020 --> 01:10:58,487
- I'm right by the entrance.
- Wait for me there.

1290
01:10:58,488 --> 01:11:00,692
[He found his way to the right place?]

1291
01:11:01,231 --> 01:11:04,205
Kwang Soo made it here.
He found it with his low hint.

1292
01:11:06,685 --> 01:11:10,208
[Checking out the camera before he
meets with the fan girl at her home.]

1293
01:11:11,242 --> 01:11:12,826
Why isn't this working?

1294
01:11:15,886 --> 01:11:18,019
I've never used this before,
so I don't know how to work it.

1295
01:11:19,787 --> 01:11:22,590
[They arrive at the very top floor.]

1296
01:11:22,591 --> 01:11:24,696
[Checking if they're in the right place.]

1297
01:11:30,799 --> 01:11:32,581
<i>Who is it?</i>

1298
01:11:32,582 --> 01:11:34,128
Hello.

1299
01:11:34,129 --> 01:11:36,387
[Is this how you work it?]

1300
01:11:36,815 --> 01:11:38,404
By any chance...

1301
01:11:39,255 --> 01:11:42,843
Is there a girl who was born in
1998 that lives here?

1302
01:11:42,844 --> 01:11:43,879
[Could this be the girl's house?]

1303
01:11:43,880 --> 01:11:47,177
Hello.
Do you have an older sister at home?

1304
01:11:47,178 --> 01:11:48,910
Or how about a little sister?

1305
01:11:48,911 --> 01:11:51,404
- I don't have a little sister.
- Then an older sister?

1306
01:11:51,405 --> 01:11:54,300
Was your older sister born in
July of 1998?

1307
01:11:54,301 --> 01:11:55,803
- No, she wasn't.
- She wasn't?

1308
01:11:56,216 --> 01:11:57,766
Sorry.

1309
01:12:00,452 --> 01:12:02,537
[In that case...]

1310
01:12:03,912 --> 01:12:06,728
[Could this be the house?]

1311
01:12:11,045 --> 01:12:14,692
[Practicing a candid photo shot.]

1312
01:12:14,693 --> 01:12:15,840
Mine won't work.

1313
01:12:16,512 --> 01:12:18,710
[Yoo Hyuk having made
his way to the interior.]

1314
01:12:19,282 --> 01:12:20,982
This is... this must be the place!

1315
01:12:22,750 --> 01:12:24,038
This is the place.

1316
01:12:24,039 --> 01:12:26,499
[Having found the place
within the picture.]

1317
01:12:28,285 --> 01:12:29,641
This has to be it.

1318
01:12:29,642 --> 01:12:31,278
This is where the picture was taken.

1319
01:12:31,279 --> 01:12:35,117
[A perfect match
to the locale in the picture.]

1320
01:12:35,118 --> 01:12:36,409
This is it.

1321
01:12:36,410 --> 01:12:38,210
This is where the picture was taken.

1322
01:12:40,634 --> 01:12:42,294
[Got it... I found the place!]

1323
01:12:43,667 --> 01:12:45,418
- I know.
- Where did Ji Hyo go?

1324
01:12:46,199 --> 01:12:48,169
- Was the picture taken from the top?
- Yeah, from the top.

1325
01:12:48,928 --> 01:12:50,922
[Big-nosed Brother's mid hint photo.]

1326
01:12:50,923 --> 01:12:54,900
Did they come here to shoot
a film recently?

1327
01:12:54,901 --> 01:12:56,275
- Yes.
- Which movie?

1328
01:12:56,276 --> 01:12:57,954
- 'Hide and Go Seek'!
- That was shot here?

1329
01:12:57,955 --> 01:12:58,984
Yes!

1330
01:13:01,588 --> 01:13:03,869
[Bingo!
The movie which Son Hyun Joo was in.]

1331
01:13:03,870 --> 01:13:07,313
[The place where the movie, 'Hide and Go Seek'
with Moon Jung Hee and Jeon Mi Sun was shot.]

1332
01:13:08,476 --> 01:13:11,238
- Where? Right up here?
- No, back there!

1333
01:13:11,239 --> 01:13:12,711
- Where?
- Let's go!

1334
01:13:12,712 --> 01:13:14,276
- Over there!
- Where?

1335
01:13:15,736 --> 01:13:17,414
- Big-nosed Brother!
- That's me!

1336
01:13:19,973 --> 01:13:22,798
[That's why there was the
'Hide and Go Seek' hint...]

1337
01:13:22,799 --> 01:13:24,547
Hide and Go Seek?

1338
01:13:24,548 --> 01:13:27,755
[Away from everyone else on his own
just to stare at the picture...]

1339
01:13:29,143 --> 01:13:32,768
[If he would just search the movie,
the name of the apartment would pop up...]

1340
01:13:34,089 --> 01:13:36,626
This looks like the place where
the movie was shot.

1341
01:13:39,433 --> 01:13:41,634
- Who is it?
- Hello.

1342
01:13:42,294 --> 01:13:46,868
I'm sorry, but is there a girl who was born
in July of 1998 that lives here?

1343
01:13:47,902 --> 01:13:49,518
How old are you?

1344
01:13:50,950 --> 01:13:53,458
- I'm ten.
- I see. Do you have an older sister?

1345
01:13:54,863 --> 01:13:57,452
- Yes.
- Is your sister in middle school?

1346
01:13:57,561 --> 01:13:58,984
Yes.

1347
01:13:58,985 --> 01:14:01,593
[Her older sister is in middle school!]

1348
01:14:02,156 --> 01:14:03,596
-Hi!
- Hi!

1349
01:14:03,597 --> 01:14:05,489
Hi. You're so cute.

1350
01:14:05,922 --> 01:14:07,969
[Mother coming to the door to
greet them with a smile.]

1351
01:14:08,633 --> 01:14:12,117
- By any chance, did your sister...
- Is your sister in 3rd year of middle school?

1352
01:14:12,118 --> 01:14:13,596
Is your sister a third year in middle school?

1353
01:14:13,597 --> 01:14:14,936
She is!

1354
01:14:15,252 --> 01:14:18,258
[They found it!
The fan girl's house!]

1355
01:14:18,814 --> 01:14:20,648
She's not here?

1356
01:14:20,649 --> 01:14:22,886
- She's not here?
- She's not home right now.

1357
01:14:22,887 --> 01:14:25,748
- Then where did she go?
- She's at school.

1358
01:14:25,749 --> 01:14:28,118
- She's at school?
- Which school does she go to?

1359
01:14:29,106 --> 01:14:31,077
- Middle school.
- But which middle school?

1360
01:14:31,078 --> 01:14:32,972
- Middle school.
- What's the name of her school?

1361
01:14:32,973 --> 01:14:35,732
[Adorable little sister knowing
how to play the variety game.]

1362
01:14:35,733 --> 01:14:37,372
She's at middle school.

1363
01:14:38,080 --> 01:14:39,763
- That's the place.
- That has to be it.

1364
01:14:39,764 --> 01:14:41,315
- That's it.
- That's the place.

1365
01:14:41,316 --> 01:14:42,975
[Correctly guesses the girl's home.]

1366
01:14:42,976 --> 01:14:44,343
- Run.
- Let's go.

1367
01:14:48,539 --> 01:14:51,106
[Countless number of Running Man pictures
in the girl's bedroom!]

1368
01:14:52,920 --> 01:14:55,609
[On top of it all,
she seems to like Kwang Soo!]

1369
01:14:56,592 --> 01:14:58,275
She's a fan of Kwang Soo.

1370
01:14:58,276 --> 01:15:01,419
[Kwang Soo related merchandise is
seen strewn all over the room.]

1371
01:15:02,650 --> 01:15:03,931
Hye Mi!

1372
01:15:05,682 --> 01:15:08,437
[Discovers the girl's name in
the signature from Kwang Soo!]

1373
01:15:08,438 --> 01:15:10,613
Your sister likes Kwang Soo?

1374
01:15:11,126 --> 01:15:12,407
Really?

1375
01:15:14,448 --> 01:15:15,994
Who do you like?

1376
01:15:15,995 --> 01:15:17,263
You.

1377
01:15:17,264 --> 01:15:18,486
You like me?

1378
01:15:22,425 --> 01:15:25,778
- Not this house, but the other one.
- I bet Ji Hyo's there right now!

1379
01:15:26,358 --> 01:15:27,926
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1380
01:15:28,999 --> 01:15:31,292
Is Ji Hyo already there?
Song Ji Hyo!

1381
01:15:32,592 --> 01:15:35,586
[Having discovered that
Ji Hyo has already been there.]

1382
01:15:35,587 --> 01:15:36,950
She's such a sly fox.

1383
01:15:38,505 --> 01:15:41,370
- Yes?
- This is the police.

1384
01:15:42,910 --> 01:15:45,600
- I think you've got the wrong house.
- Song Ji Hyo.

1385
01:15:45,601 --> 01:15:47,775
No, it's Gary, isn't it?
Gary?

1386
01:15:48,128 --> 01:15:50,764
A driver?
I didn't call for a driver.

1387
01:15:50,765 --> 01:15:53,088
I said, Gary, not Driver.
Seriously.

1388
01:15:53,089 --> 01:15:55,136
- Gary.
- Open the door, Gary.

1389
01:15:55,898 --> 01:15:59,185
I'm going to call the police
if you keep this up.

1390
01:16:00,264 --> 01:16:02,170
Don't open the door to them.

1391
01:16:02,171 --> 01:16:04,215
Why do you keep acting like that?

1392
01:16:04,216 --> 01:16:06,033
- You almost had me fooled.
- Gary.

1393
01:16:06,034 --> 01:16:07,923
- She's not here right now.
- What?

1394
01:16:07,924 --> 01:16:10,472
- She's not home right now.
- She's not?

1395
01:16:12,461 --> 01:16:14,945
[Kwang Soo walking into Hye Mi's room.]

1396
01:16:22,544 --> 01:16:28,808
[All over the room... is
proof of her love for the Giraffe.]

1397
01:16:28,809 --> 01:16:31,108
[Me... me?]

1398
01:16:37,866 --> 01:16:40,202
[This is what Hye Mi looks like!]

1399
01:16:41,585 --> 01:16:44,646
[His own signature is lovingly
framed in her room!]

1400
01:16:47,286 --> 01:16:48,496
What?

1401
01:16:48,497 --> 01:16:50,480
This place is full of giraffes!

1402
01:16:50,481 --> 01:16:52,516
She must be a fan of yours.
She even has your signature.

1403
01:16:56,526 --> 01:16:58,546
She has your signature in a frame.

1404
01:16:58,547 --> 01:17:00,433
Look at all the goosebumps on my arms.

1405
01:17:01,168 --> 01:17:03,897
I know her.
I know her name too.

1406
01:17:07,408 --> 01:17:08,925
There's her name.

1407
01:17:10,740 --> 01:17:13,525
[Her name can be seen written
inside the frame.]

1408
01:17:13,526 --> 01:17:14,789
Hye Mi.

1409
01:17:14,790 --> 01:17:16,774
Gary and Ji Hyo already saw
everything in this room.

1410
01:17:16,775 --> 01:17:18,332
Really?

1411
01:17:20,960 --> 01:17:23,749
[This is the middle school that she attends!]

1412
01:17:25,980 --> 01:17:28,471
[Name- Ahn Hye Mi.]

1413
01:17:30,008 --> 01:17:32,167
[School- Wabu Middle School.]

1414
01:17:32,168 --> 01:17:35,883
She has lessons from 6-9 p.m.

1415
01:17:35,884 --> 01:17:38,888
[Hye Mi's at school!]

1416
01:17:39,494 --> 01:17:42,353
[Hye Mi's school- Wabu Middle School.]

1417
01:17:42,354 --> 01:17:43,798
This is Wabu Middle School.

1418
01:17:43,799 --> 01:17:47,307
<i>Hye Mi's notebook is hidden somewhere
in a classroom on the third floor.</i>

1419
01:17:47,308 --> 01:17:52,037
<i>The person to put Hye Mi's picture on the
last page of that notebook is the winner.</i>

1420
01:17:52,038 --> 01:17:53,358
<i>You must hurry.</i>

1421
01:17:55,147 --> 01:17:56,397
Hello.

1422
01:17:56,398 --> 01:17:57,602
Hello.

1423
01:17:57,603 --> 01:17:59,139
Is this the place?

1424
01:17:59,140 --> 01:18:00,813
Have you seen a notebook
around here?

1425
01:18:00,814 --> 01:18:03,279
[The original notebook is right here!]

1426
01:18:07,606 --> 01:18:11,280
[The rest of the members rush in
to find the original notebook.]

1427
01:18:11,281 --> 01:18:13,912
It has to be around here somewhere.
Is it okay if we look for it?

1428
01:18:15,732 --> 01:18:18,300
[Searching every other place except
for where the notebook is.]

1429
01:18:22,639 --> 01:18:24,893
[Gary walking in one step behind
everyone else.]

1430
01:18:24,894 --> 01:18:27,157
- Hello.
- Is this the only teacher's office?

1431
01:18:30,377 --> 01:18:32,004
- Really?
- Are there any other rooms?

1432
01:18:34,382 --> 01:18:37,363
[Discovers the real notebook!]

1433
01:18:37,364 --> 01:18:38,741
There are seven offices?

1434
01:18:42,968 --> 01:18:44,423
Where are you going, Gary?

1435
01:18:46,344 --> 01:18:47,684
Where are you going, Gary?

1436
01:18:48,021 --> 01:18:49,767
[Did she not see it?]

1437
01:18:54,451 --> 01:18:55,540
I found it!

1438
01:18:57,995 --> 01:18:59,672
Is it okay if I open these drawers?

1439
01:18:59,946 --> 01:19:02,368
[Everyone else is searching
all the wrong places.]

1440
01:19:05,189 --> 01:19:06,593
I found it right away.

1441
01:19:06,594 --> 01:19:09,503
Hello.
Where are all the students right now?

1442
01:19:12,377 --> 01:19:15,390
[Gary's asking around to
locate Hye Mi.]

1443
01:19:19,518 --> 01:19:22,297
Sorry, what I did was wrong.
Please spank me with the whip.

1444
01:19:22,937 --> 01:19:24,911
[Must be reminded of his school days.]

1445
01:19:25,703 --> 01:19:27,195
Where's the notebook?

1446
01:19:29,584 --> 01:19:31,573
It's in here somewhere, right?

1447
01:19:31,574 --> 01:19:33,182
Guys, do you know who Hye Mi is?

1448
01:19:33,183 --> 01:19:34,713
Ahn Hye Mi?

1449
01:19:34,714 --> 01:19:36,425
Ahn Hye Mi.
She's a third year student.

1450
01:19:36,426 --> 01:19:38,345
- Do you know who Hye Mi is?
- Ahn Hye Mi?

1451
01:19:38,346 --> 01:19:40,121
- Yeah, Ahn Hye Mi.
- I think she's in classroom number five.

1452
01:19:40,122 --> 01:19:41,803
- Okay. Where's Hye Mi.
- Check room number five.

1453
01:19:42,937 --> 01:19:44,513
There's only one notebook?

1454
01:19:44,514 --> 01:19:47,214
There's only one?
What if someone's already found it?

1455
01:19:47,642 --> 01:19:49,051
No way.

1456
01:19:49,472 --> 01:19:50,682
Who's not in here?

1457
01:19:50,683 --> 01:19:52,171
Where did Gary go?

1458
01:19:52,172 --> 01:19:53,710
Did he find it already?

1459
01:19:54,339 --> 01:19:55,959
Where did Gary go?

1460
01:19:55,960 --> 01:19:57,262
[Showing surprising deduction skills.]

1461
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:03,684
[Find Hye Mi!]

1462
01:20:03,685 --> 01:20:06,262
Excuse me.
Where are all the students?

1463
01:20:10,215 --> 01:20:11,757
Have you seen Gary around?

1464
01:20:17,663 --> 01:20:19,767
[Gary is found!]

1465
01:20:20,589 --> 01:20:23,209
[Catch him!]

1466
01:20:28,434 --> 01:20:30,270
- You found it, didn't you?
- No, I haven't found it.

1467
01:20:30,271 --> 01:20:32,345
- I'm just trying to find Hye Mi first.
- Gary.

1468
01:20:32,346 --> 01:20:34,176
I know what Hye Mi looks like.

1469
01:20:34,177 --> 01:20:35,385
Gary.

1470
01:20:36,712 --> 01:20:38,575
- Did you find it?
- No, I didn't.

1471
01:20:39,098 --> 01:20:41,673
I'm trying to find Hye Mi first.
This isn't the real one.

1472
01:20:41,674 --> 01:20:43,002
- You found it, didn't you?
- No, I didn't.

1473
01:20:43,003 --> 01:20:44,702
- Gary.
- No.

1474
01:20:46,322 --> 01:20:49,099
[Gary ultimately gets caught in his lie.]

1475
01:20:51,633 --> 01:20:54,007
- Let's search for her together.
- I can see that you found it.

1476
01:20:54,008 --> 01:20:56,404
Everyone's looking for you.
You need to run away.

1477
01:20:57,643 --> 01:21:00,739
[The two iconic traitors surrounding Gary
with his authentic notebook.]

1478
01:21:00,740 --> 01:21:03,277
- Let us help you.
- Let me win something for once.

1479
01:21:03,278 --> 01:21:06,822
Okay, but you've won a lot
of individual missions in the past.

1480
01:21:06,823 --> 01:21:08,454
- Do you know what she looks like?
- Of course, I do.

1481
01:21:15,548 --> 01:21:18,024
- Good thing we found you first.
- Gary.

1482
01:21:20,691 --> 01:21:22,972
I think I really need to go find
Hye Mi first.

1483
01:21:24,646 --> 01:21:28,103
[Everyone is now convinced beyond doubt
that Gary has the notebook.]

1484
01:21:28,104 --> 01:21:31,943
Even if I do have the notebook,
it doesn't matter if I don't find Hye Mi.

1485
01:21:31,944 --> 01:21:36,143
- We have to find Hye Mi first.
- We have to find her and get her picture.

1486
01:21:36,629 --> 01:21:38,414
Finding Hye Mi should be our priority.

1487
01:21:39,132 --> 01:21:43,497
[Where could Hye Mi be?]

1488
01:21:44,340 --> 01:21:45,643
Hi, girls.

1489
01:21:45,644 --> 01:21:49,329
[Where could the third year students be?]

1490
01:21:49,330 --> 01:21:51,960
- Third year students?
- On the upper floor?

1491
01:21:51,961 --> 01:21:55,244
- Are you third year students?
- I could go with you.

1492
01:21:55,245 --> 01:21:56,700
- Okay, here?
- Come with us.

1493
01:21:58,220 --> 01:22:02,300
[Searching with the help of
other students.]

1494
01:22:05,165 --> 01:22:10,306
[Where are you, Hye Mi?]

1495
01:22:16,053 --> 01:22:20,840
[Could one of those girls be... Hye Mi?]

1496
01:22:22,858 --> 01:22:25,542
[Both Kwang Soo and the students
are in a state of shock.]

1497
01:22:27,265 --> 01:22:31,790
[He discovers Hye Mi whom
he's been so desperately searching for!]

1498
01:22:37,133 --> 01:22:39,855
[By following Hye Mi's book...]

1499
01:22:39,856 --> 01:22:43,524
[he finds Hye Mi.]

1500
01:22:51,771 --> 01:22:57,573
[Having ran all day in a race to find
the girl who showed them her love...]

1501
01:23:01,291 --> 01:23:04,949
[At last, Hye Mi is
right in front of his eyes.]

1502
01:23:05,587 --> 01:23:07,370
Hang on, Hye Mi.
Stay in hiding.

1503
01:23:12,164 --> 01:23:14,008
- Seriously.
- Seriously.

1504
01:23:14,009 --> 01:23:16,211
What's the point of looking for her
when you don't even have the notebook?

1505
01:23:16,212 --> 01:23:19,085
We have to get the picture first before
we start worrying about the notebook.

1506
01:23:19,086 --> 01:23:21,791
Gary is looking for you,
so you have to stay in hiding.

1507
01:23:21,792 --> 01:23:23,611
Gary has your notebook.

1508
01:23:24,977 --> 01:23:26,883
Why are you going in there?

1509
01:23:30,020 --> 01:23:33,537
[Hyuk and Kkuk heading in Hye Mi's direction.]

1510
01:23:34,196 --> 01:23:35,881
Hye Mi!
You're making yourself too obvious!

1511
01:23:35,882 --> 01:23:37,765
I can totally see where you're hiding!

1512
01:23:40,857 --> 01:23:43,069
Where is she?
Is Hye Mi in there?

1513
01:23:45,433 --> 01:23:48,013
[Entering the classroom where
Hye Mi is hiding.]

1514
01:23:53,130 --> 01:23:54,717
Hi!

1515
01:23:55,432 --> 01:23:59,017
[Huh? They don't recognize Hye Mi
and just walks on by.]

1516
01:24:00,435 --> 01:24:02,071
Study hard, okay?

1517
01:24:03,551 --> 01:24:04,971
Wait!

1518
01:24:06,601 --> 01:24:10,159
[Wait...]

1519
01:24:10,160 --> 01:24:12,440
[Could that girl be...]

1520
01:24:12,441 --> 01:24:14,856
[the same Hye Mi we've been
searching for?]

1521
01:24:19,542 --> 01:24:20,867
Wait, I think...

1522
01:24:22,905 --> 01:24:24,506
I think...

1523
01:24:24,507 --> 01:24:25,961
[Darn!]

1524
01:24:30,707 --> 01:24:31,999
I think that's her.

1525
01:24:32,934 --> 01:24:34,830
[Hye Mi is unsure of what to do.]

1526
01:24:35,896 --> 01:24:37,647
[Kwang Soo feeling the pressure
asks for her picture right away.]

1527
01:24:37,648 --> 01:24:38,762
Wait.

1528
01:24:39,487 --> 01:24:41,012
Run, Hye Mi!

1529
01:24:41,013 --> 01:24:43,749
Don't take your picture with them!
Don't do it! Run!

1530
01:24:43,750 --> 01:24:45,415
Don't let them take your picture!

1531
01:24:46,212 --> 01:24:47,653
They're bad people!

1532
01:24:47,654 --> 01:24:50,150
Every man in this world is the same
except for me!

1533
01:24:50,151 --> 01:24:52,363
[Running away without knowing
the reason behind it.]

1534
01:24:56,728 --> 01:25:00,522
[Kwang Soo succeeds in
getting her picture.]

1535
01:25:03,165 --> 01:25:04,851
I just need to find Gary now.

1536
01:25:10,538 --> 01:25:12,001
I think that's her.

1537
01:25:17,298 --> 01:25:20,137
[Total chaos in Hye Mi's wake.]

1538
01:25:20,138 --> 01:25:21,717
There she is!

1539
01:25:30,837 --> 01:25:34,616
[Photo time with hard to find Hye Mi!]

1540
01:25:38,545 --> 01:25:39,786
Run!

1541
01:25:42,612 --> 01:25:43,862
- Run!
- Hye Mi!

1542
01:25:43,863 --> 01:25:45,216
Run away!

1543
01:25:46,013 --> 01:25:47,377
Hye Mi!

1544
01:25:47,378 --> 01:25:50,546
[Oh no!
Of all people, the Tiger?]

1545
01:25:50,547 --> 01:25:52,529
Why don't you want to take
a picture with me?

1546
01:25:53,014 --> 01:25:55,772
Okay, Hye Mi.
Just one picture.

1547
01:25:55,773 --> 01:25:57,655
- Hye Mi!
- Hye Mi, run!

1548
01:25:58,828 --> 01:26:01,707
[Trying to take a picture of himself with
her while on the chase.]

1549
01:26:03,716 --> 01:26:05,983
[Where's Hye Mi?]

1550
01:26:18,257 --> 01:26:21,191
[Gary with the real notebook...]

1551
01:26:21,192 --> 01:26:22,884
- We have to stop him.
- Hye Mi.

1552
01:26:22,885 --> 01:26:24,184
Hye Mi!

1553
01:26:24,185 --> 01:26:25,434
Hye Mi!

1554
01:26:26,703 --> 01:26:29,249
- I have one too.
- Let's take a picture together, Hye Mi.

1555
01:26:29,250 --> 01:26:31,456
[Taking the opportunity for a picture!]

1556
01:26:33,101 --> 01:26:34,897
Hye Mi!

1557
01:26:34,898 --> 01:26:36,083
[Gary is blocked out of the way.]

1558
01:26:39,003 --> 01:26:40,628
- Stop Gary.
- Hye Mi!

1559
01:26:40,629 --> 01:26:42,418
- Hi, Hye Mi.
- Stop him.

1560
01:26:42,419 --> 01:26:44,707
Look over here, Hye Mi.

1561
01:26:47,164 --> 01:26:49,667
[Gary succeeds in getting the picture!]

1562
01:26:49,668 --> 01:26:50,985
We have to stop Gary!

1563
01:26:51,258 --> 01:26:53,575
[Catch him!]

1564
01:26:55,223 --> 01:26:57,222
Why are you doing this to me!

1565
01:26:57,223 --> 01:26:59,202
My picture hasn't even developed yet!

1566
01:27:03,068 --> 01:27:05,580
What do I have to do in order
for Kwang Soo to win?

1567
01:27:08,190 --> 01:27:11,096
[In order for Kwang Soo to win...]

1568
01:27:11,097 --> 01:27:13,727
[He needs to get the authentic
notebook away from Gary.]

1569
01:27:20,619 --> 01:27:22,271
Lee Kwang Soo!

1570
01:27:23,355 --> 01:27:25,826
[The real notebook is now in
Ha Ha's hands!]

1571
01:27:28,181 --> 01:27:29,693
We can't lose him.

1572
01:27:32,933 --> 01:27:34,497
I'm going to drop it.
Don't come any closer.

1573
01:27:37,229 --> 01:27:39,296
[Right to Gary!]

1574
01:27:40,769 --> 01:27:42,329
[Darn!]

1575
01:27:43,965 --> 01:27:49,210
[As soon as Gary puts his picture of
Hye Mi on the very last page...]

1576
01:27:53,689 --> 01:27:55,617
[Big-nose's steal!]

1577
01:28:00,676 --> 01:28:04,164
[Big-nose Brother!]

1578
01:28:05,259 --> 01:28:07,607
I was about to stick it with my spit,
but I got the wrong page.

1579
01:28:12,663 --> 01:28:17,309
[Big-nose Brother is the winner!]

1580
01:28:27,915 --> 01:28:29,482
<i>A round of applause!</i>

1581
01:28:29,483 --> 01:28:33,649
Ji Suk Jin!
Ji Suk Jin!

1582
01:28:33,650 --> 01:28:36,425
The sole winner!
Ji Suk Jin!

1583
01:28:36,426 --> 01:28:40,220
- Ji Suk Jin!
- Sole winner for the first time ever!

1584
01:28:40,221 --> 01:28:43,320
[After 165 episodes...
A sole winner for the very first time!]

1585
01:28:44,712 --> 01:28:47,556
He was able to win today
all thanks to Hye Mi.

1586
01:28:47,557 --> 01:28:53,845
- I'm so sorry for what we did to your book.
- Sorry, but we kind of ruined your book.

1587
01:28:53,846 --> 01:28:56,567
- I'm sorry.
- You must be a huge fan of Kwang Soo's.

1588
01:28:56,568 --> 01:28:59,069
- Look at this here.
- I'm sorry, Hye Mi!

1589
01:28:59,070 --> 01:29:01,276
- Look at all these pictures of Kwang Soo.
- I was going to win for you today!

1590
01:29:02,215 --> 01:29:05,114
- I'm sorry!
- Why do you like Kwang Soo so much?

1591
01:29:05,800 --> 01:29:10,393
I saw him for the first time at
a movie opening.

1592
01:29:11,318 --> 01:29:15,657
When he walked onto the stage...
flowers were swirling around him.

1593
01:29:15,658 --> 01:29:17,052
[What? Swirling flowers?]

1594
01:29:18,220 --> 01:29:23,416
[The man who walked on stage amongst
a swirl of flowers?]

1595
01:29:25,852 --> 01:29:29,508
How could there have been swirling flowers
when Kwang Soo was walking?

1596
01:29:30,198 --> 01:29:33,523
[Thanks, Hye Mi.]

1597
01:29:34,423 --> 01:29:40,477
Anyway, all thanks to Hye Mi,
we were able to go around the city

1598
01:29:40,478 --> 01:29:42,539
and made a lot of nice new memories.

1599
01:29:42,540 --> 01:29:44,517
We even rock climbed the wall
all thanks to Hye Mi.

1600
01:29:44,518 --> 01:29:47,637
- Yes, we did.
- You're so knowledgeable about Namyang.

1601
01:29:47,638 --> 01:29:49,673
We did everything that Hye Mi
wanted us to do.

1602
01:29:49,674 --> 01:29:51,796
Yes, we did everything that
you took a picture of.

1603
01:29:51,797 --> 01:29:54,146
- That's so awesome.
- You know that picture of the library?

1604
01:29:54,147 --> 01:29:56,143
- Yes.
- We went there today.

1605
01:29:56,144 --> 01:29:58,698
We went there and had to
answer a lot of ridiculous questions.

1606
01:29:59,408 --> 01:30:02,689
This whole episode was possible
because of you, Hye Mi.

1607
01:30:02,690 --> 01:30:05,308
[Hye Mi was the creator
for this entire episode!]

1608
01:30:05,309 --> 01:30:08,967
- It was all thanks to you.
- That's so awesome!

1609
01:30:08,968 --> 01:30:10,955
This is what we went by.

1610
01:30:10,956 --> 01:30:15,579
- We all have a copy of this.
- We used your book to do our mission today.

1611
01:30:15,580 --> 01:30:18,064
- We went to all these places.
- Wow, that's awesome.

1612
01:30:18,637 --> 01:30:24,437
Thanks so much to Hye Mi for creating this
episode for Running Man.

1613
01:30:24,438 --> 01:30:28,176
This was Hye Mi's special episode.
And do you have anything to say to Kwang Soo?

1614
01:30:28,177 --> 01:30:30,633
[Anything she'd like to say to Kwang Soo?]

1615
01:30:30,634 --> 01:30:32,988
- Ask him for a hug.
- Why don't you shake his hand?

1616
01:30:32,989 --> 01:30:34,845
Yeah, give her a hug.

1617
01:30:34,846 --> 01:30:36,379
Okay.

1618
01:30:36,380 --> 01:30:39,331
[A hug to remember Kwang Soo by.]

1619
01:30:39,332 --> 01:30:44,504
Promise him that whenever you stop liking
him, that you'd still be cool with him.

1620
01:30:44,505 --> 01:30:46,730
That's the best thing you
can do for Hye Mi.

1621
01:30:46,731 --> 01:30:48,897
You're dead if you ever stop liking me!

1622
01:30:49,710 --> 01:30:51,016
Don't joke like that.

1623
01:30:52,336 --> 01:30:55,506
Let's take one last group shot
before we go.

1624
01:30:55,507 --> 01:30:57,440
Thanks, everyone!

1625
01:31:01,555 --> 01:31:02,928
<i>[Thank you to Hye Mi's mother,
Hye Mi's sister, Hye Won for your cooperation</i>

1626
01:31:02,928 --> 01:31:06,332
<i>and to everyone else in the city for
all your help and participation.]</i>

1627
01:31:06,333 --> 01:31:07,963
One, two, three!
