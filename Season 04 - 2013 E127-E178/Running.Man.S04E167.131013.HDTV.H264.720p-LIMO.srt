162
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,020
[Secret Agent, Kwang Ja-
Okay... it's finally starting.]

163
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:35,600
[Traditional village in Bucheon.]

164
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:39,680
[They're driving?
Since they're all over the age of 20...]

165
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:42,890
- I think we're going to a rice paddy.
- Where?

166
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:44,680
- A rice paddy.
- We're going to a rice paddy?

167
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:47,340
- Yes.
- Seriously...

168
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:50,540
We just did something at the rice paddy,
and we're going back to it already?

169
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:52,460
I doubt we'll be doing
the same thing.

170
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:56,240
- I'm not sure.
- I doubt it'll be the same thing, right?

171
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:59,450
- But we have Jung Myung on our team.
- Yes, Chun Jung Myung.

172
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:01,420
Of course.
Jung Myung knows what he's doing.

173
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:04,460
- How can I know what we're doing?
- Jung Myung's really competitive too.

174
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:07,520
Even though he's always smiling,
he's actually fiercely competitive.

175
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:12,170
- I'd be afraid of him if he was my opponent.
- Yeah, I would be too.

176
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:13,920
- But we're on the same team.
- Yes.

177
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:16,330
I'm glad he's on our team.

178
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,200
Let's go.

179
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,590
[First to arrive is, Team Delinquents.]

180
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:25,760
<i>Please get yourselves ready</i>

181
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:29,400
<i>and first team to enter the game arena
will automatically move on to the final round.</i>

182
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,710
- You may go.
- Let's go. Quickly!

183
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:34,590
- The final round!
- Wow... could it be?

184
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,520
- The second team is already here.
- Where?

185
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:41,820
<i>The first team to enter the game arena
will automatically move on to the final round.</i>

186
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:43,530
- The final round?
- Okay!

187
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:51,740
[The final round will be mine!]

188
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:58,730
[The place that they're running to is...]

189
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:02,720
[Rice paddy ice skating rink.]

190
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:05,870
They've filled the field with water again.

191
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:15,180
[A specially prepared ring
in this quiet and peaceful field.]

192
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:18,120
- Hurry, Ji Hyo!
- Kwang Ja will win.

193
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:21,800
[Will it be Ji Hyo, or will it be Kwang Ja?]

194
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:24,600
- How is that important right now?
- Hurry, Ji Hyo!

195
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:27,500
[I'm a girl...]

196
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:29,960
- Hurry, Ji Hyo!
- What are you doing, Kwang Ja?

197
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:33,540
Hang on, I have to tie my hair.
Don't you know what girls are like?

198
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:36,880
Hurry!

199
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:40,010
[Which school will the final round go to?]

200
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:42,260
[Both feet are up on the platform!]

201
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:47,530
<i>The winners are, Yoo Jae Suk,
Chun Jung Myung, and Song Ji Hyo.</i>

202
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:49,570
[The final round goes to, Team Delinquents!]

203
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:51,980
<i>Song Ji Hyo beat you and set both of her
feet up on the platform first.</i>

204
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:56,420
[Team Traitor's Kwang Ja having lost their
chance to move on by getting her hair tied.]

205
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:57,600
Nice.

206
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,400
<i>Welcome everyone.</i>

207
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:03,540
The first game you'll be playing is called,
the 'Rice Paddy Ridge'.]

208
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:06,090
<i>You have to make sure that your female
teammate can get across the field without</i>

209
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:08,840
<i>getting their clothes wet in the process.</i>

210
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:12,860
<i>If you look behind you,
you'll see a stack of boards.</i>

211
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:16,770
<i>You'll be using those boards to build
a bridge for your female teammate.</i>

212
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,410
<i>One member from each team can go
get the board and return with a board</i>

213
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:24,640
<i>and the female member can stand on it
and wait until another one is placed for them.</i>

214
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:27,400
Come here, Ji Hyo. We're
already moved up to the final round.

215
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,510
- The guys can't touch the girls, right?
- No, they can't.

216
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:31,850
Can the girls touch each other?

217
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,750
- The two women can touch each other.
- Okay.

218
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,920
What do you mean, they can?

219
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,490
Kwang Soo, I will give you my energy
to leg trip the girls.

220
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:40,180
[Ambitious Secret Agent, Kwang Ja.]

221
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:41,230
Ready!

222
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:42,820
Set!

223
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:49,890
- Hang on a minute.
- Do you see what he's doing?

224
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:53,290
- You have to start!
- Can you get rid of this thug?

225
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,530
[Others can't even budge a muscle with
the Tiger exerting his strength on them.]

226
00:11:57,530 --> 00:11:59,900
Just shove Kim Jong Kook aside.

227
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,570
- You just wait. Your turn is coming.
- What did you say?

228
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:06,590
- I just told you to wait your turn.
- Let's go. Fighting!

229
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:07,820
- Fighting!
- Fighting!

230
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:09,220
Fighting.

231
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,740
Ready.

232
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,830
Ready, set!

233
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:20,600
[Moving quickly to start
building their bridge.]

234
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,190
Hurry! Hurry!

235
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:33,880
[Not a bit of hesitation on the rice paddy
even in the midst of the hot weather.]

236
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:42,890
You have to put it down straight!

237
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:45,420
- Hurry!
- You have to hurry!

238
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,510
[Must start over from the beginning
if you fall in the water.]

239
00:12:58,470 --> 00:12:59,710
Okay, walk over.

240
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:10,060
[Team Traitors bridge proving
to be not so steady.]

241
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:18,650
[Min Jung is carefully making her way
forward one step at a time.]

242
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:28,340
- Aren't you going to set that down?
- Hurry up and move up a step.

243
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:39,490
[Kwang Ja enjoying her game of
playing in the mucky water.]

244
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:43,350
You have to put it down better so that
I don't keep falling in the water!

245
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:48,420
- On my goodness!
- Carefully. One step at a time.

246
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:54,910
- You have to set that down. Suk Jin!
- Hurry!

247
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:57,350
[Team Tiger almost makes it
onto the platform already.]

248
00:14:04,770 --> 00:14:07,450
[Kwang Ja is still having fun
splashing around in the water.]

249
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:13,090
[This won't do...]

250
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:15,290
You said that the girls are allowed
to touch each other, right?

251
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,070
[Drop kick?]

252
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:22,650
[Let's splash around in the water together!]

253
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:26,300
Hurry up!

254
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:33,120
Hurry up and set down the steps!

255
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:36,740
[Having to start over from the beginning
and crossing the bridge again.]

256
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,620
Lower your knees and bend down.

257
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:49,330
[Hard to find their balance on
top of the paddy bridge.]

258
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:54,820
[Kwang Ja also gets on her way.]

259
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:06,360
[Wow... look at her move!]

260
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:12,360
[Succeeds in crossing the bridge!]

261
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:20,880
You wouldn't have won so easily
if you were playing against us.

262
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:28,040
- You just wait because we're coming for you.
- Chun Myung is readying himself for this.

263
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:29,980
[Seemingly relaxed]

264
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:33,610
What if Chun Myung makes one of his moves?
Chun Myung, you can't do this, okay?

265
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:43,400
What are you doing
to a girl right now, Jae Suk?

266
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:46,170
- I'm helping you dump out the water.
- What are you doing to a girl?

267
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:47,710
- I'm helping you dump the water out.
- Don't do that.

268
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:54,260
<i>Can the girl team member say a word
of encouragement for their men?</i>

269
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:57,390
Why don't you say something cool
to Min Jung?

270
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:59,290
Didn't you say that you were going to
say something to Min Jung earlier?

271
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:01,640
- You said you'll show us something, right?
- Kwang Soo.

272
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,750
What about the song we made up earlier?
Why don't you sing that for her?

273
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:05,380
You made up another song?

274
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:08,290
- Sing it right now.
- Go on and sing it for her.

275
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:12,450
- One, two, three, four.
- Min Jung's face is so beautiful!

276
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:14,210
<i>So beautiful!</i>

277
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:16,530
- Even her body is beautiful!
- Beautiful!

278
00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:18,720
- Even her personality is beautiful!
- Beautiful!

279
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:26,540
- That's a pretty nice song.
- You liked that song, didn't you?

280
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:29,380
You are inside my heart!

281
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:33,790
- That's it. She fell for it.
- She's liking that right now.

282
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:35,840
- I think she fell for that song.
- Round two.

283
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:38,530
[Team Tiger vs. Team Traitor- Round two.]

284
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:44,790
[Team Traitor's two male students unable
to budge from the Tiger's grasp.]

285
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:50,280
[Gary takes the opportunity to carefully
set down the first board with ease.]

286
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:54,330
- We have to get going.
- Okay, it's my turn. I have to go.

287
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:56,210
[Please let me go!]

288
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:01,020
Hang on to him!
Cling onto him, Dong Hoon!

289
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:04,630
[Resuming their building of the bridge
by switching out the players.]

290
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:09,090
That's too far up.
That's too big of a gap.

291
00:17:09,090 --> 00:17:11,710
[Relying on Kwang Ja's long legs to step
further out, and building as he sees fit.]

292
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:17,520
[The construction coming to a halt
whenever they encounter the Tiger.]

293
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,530
Cling onto him!

294
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:22,270
[The construction of Team Tiger's bridge
steadily coming along.]

295
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:25,720
[You're not going anywhere!]

296
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,870
[Full of desire to go build their bridge,
but they just keep circling in their place.]

297
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:32,020
You have to let me go!

298
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:34,470
- You have to let me go!
- Don't let him go no matter what!

299
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:42,530
[Tiger's tightly woven bridge steps.]

300
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:44,570
[Mere two spaces?]

301
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,740
[Putting faith in his long legs to
start making his way forward.]

302
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,660
One more!
One more!

303
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,500
[No!]

304
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,980
[Frontal face plant like a tree
being knocked down.]

305
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:20,170
Look what you did to my wig!

306
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:24,780
[Team Tiger not paying any attention to
Kwang Ja and steadily making their way up.]

307
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:28,140
Kwang Ja's going to get started again.

308
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:36,370
[Kwang Ja unable to watch the other team
making progress in their game.]

309
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:41,900
I'm sorry!
What I did was wrong!

310
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:49,630
[Everyone back to their starting line.]

311
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:55,590
- It's four spaces.
- Hurry!

312
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,070
[Sloppy construction.]

313
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:02,810
Can't you build it right?

314
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:04,720
Don't you know what you're doing?

315
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:09,610
[Min Jung already having crossed
the halfway mark.]

316
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:19,060
[You're not going anywhere!]

317
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:23,360
[Min Jung taking another step forward.]

318
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:27,100
One more!

319
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:30,830
[The final board for Min Jung
to make her way onto the platform.]

320
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,830
[Kwang Ja's mere wish is to take
at least one solid step forward.]

321
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,630
[Team Tiger wins!]

322
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:55,340
- Take better care of Kwang Ja!

a wrestling ring...]

Let him go!

386

[Jae Suk makes his way over to put
another board down for the bridge.]

Look at this.
What is this?

405
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:30,750
How could he have ripped your shirt
down the middle like that?

406
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:32,890
It's because he had me locked
in such a tight grasp.

407
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:35,620
What were you doing up there?

408
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:42,580

battle is going on...]

00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:13,110
Seriously, Jae Suk.

491
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:16,130
Jung Myung was very quick to tell me
that I was biting his foot.

492
00:31:16,610 --> 00:31:18,170
This is the final round!

493
00:31:18,170 --> 00:31:21,940
- Jae Suk, bite him and kick him.
- Okay. Don't worry, Ji Hyo.

494
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:23,380
Tear him part, Jong Kook!

495
00:31:23,890 --> 00:31:26,380
- Tear him apart? Okay.
- Fine, I'll show you.

496
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:29,060
- Just tear him to shreds.
- This is it!

497
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:31,160
Okay, is everyone ready?

498
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:33,570
- This is the final round.
- Jung Myung can do this.

499
00:31:33,570 --> 00:31:35,120
Final round.
Ready!

500
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,440
Set!

501
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:43,090
Jung Myung's starting already.

502
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:46,180
[Using his martial moves again.]

503
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,720
We just need to win this round!
This round is it!

504
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:53,090
[Gary is the first to escape
from the melee.]

505
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:59,410
[Jujitsu Jung Myung uses his moves again
to escape from the Tiger's clutches.]

506
00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:07,300
[Using biting Grasshopper's weakness
to tickle him to release his grasp.]

507
00:32:10,730 --> 00:32:12,420
Take him down, Jung Myung!

508
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,540
Hurry!
Hurry, Jong Kook!

509
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:19,760
[The final show of their fierce competition.]

510
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,100
[Full of excitement.]

511
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:29,650
This is entertaining!

512
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:35,080
[Team Tiger leading the race
by the split of a hair.]

513
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:39,130
[You're not going anywhere!]

514
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:43,190
[A full frontal attack.]

515
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:50,520
[Suppressing the Tiger
with a blow to his head.]

516
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:55,110
[The Tiger losing his senses from
the surprise blow to his head.]

517
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:06,200
[Biting Grasshopper taking advantage of
the moment to construct their bridge.]

518
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:11,330
[Jujitsu Jung Myung tying down
both of them.]

519
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:15,330
[Not letting go of his grasp.]

520
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:17,990
Just take off your shirt!

521
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:20,300
Don't pull down my pants!

522
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:27,050
We're burning up over here!
This has been going on for two hours!

523
00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:30,590
[Fierce UFC battle happening
right here on the rice paddy.]

524
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,830
He's trying to turn this game
into a UFC Championship!

525
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:49,030
[Team Delinquent's bridge is
almost complete!]

526
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,770
[Crosses the bridge onto the platform!]

527
00:33:53,690 --> 00:33:56,240
[Team Delinquent wins!]

528
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:58,370
Jung Myung hit me on the head
with the board!

529
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:03,010
[First time in the history of a variety show?
A blow to the head with a board...]

530
00:34:03,630 --> 00:34:05,390
I heard the thud!

531
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:09,220
[Jujitsu Jung Myung
doing a number on the Tiger.]

532
00:34:09,830 --> 00:34:11,420
I got hit on the head.

533
00:34:13,270 --> 00:34:18,600
The winning team is, Team Yoo Jae Suk,
Chun Jung Myung, and Song Ji Hyo.

534
00:34:19,490 --> 00:34:22,880
Coming in at second place is,
Team Kim Jong Kook, Min Jung, and Gary.

535
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:26,650
Everyone, there are three different
hints in these envelopes.

536
00:34:26,650 --> 00:34:27,910
Yes.

537
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:29,890
You chose number three. Look at
it discreetly and don't show anyone.

538
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:35,590
[Second place winner, Team Tiger
chooses hint number three.]

539
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:40,750
Since the team that came in at last place
can't take this last remaining hint...

540
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:45,320
- No!
- Give it to us!

541
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:47,460
- No! Why are you doing that?
- Hey!

542
00:34:47,790 --> 00:34:52,250
[That hint... I really need it!]

543
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:55,650
<i>I have to get my hands on that hint
without anyone else knowing about it.</i>

544
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:58,170
When did you get so evil?

545
00:34:58,610 --> 00:34:59,940
- Pick up the pieces.
- Hey!

546
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:01,740
It's because you wasted time tying back
your hair.

547
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:04,090
- What's the point with that face of yours?
- You think you know about women?

548
00:35:04,090 --> 00:35:05,610
That's right, I know!

549
00:35:06,550 --> 00:35:10,400
[Thus, Kwang Ja failed at her attempt
in gaining a hint...]

550
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:16,120
<i>[Go to Yeouido.]</i>

551
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:17,770
<i>World Cup.</i>

552
00:35:17,770 --> 00:35:19,630
- World Cup?
- Yes, World Cup.

553
00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:21,900
- That's all that was written on there?
- Yes, just 'World Cup'.

554
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:23,520
I have no idea what that's telling us.

555
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,680
[Insufficient information.]

556
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:28,530
What happened earlier on that field
is no different than a martial arts match.

557
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:30,210
Do you know that?

558
00:35:31,790 --> 00:35:33,700
That felt really good.

559
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:36,320
What do you mean, that felt good?

560
00:35:37,910 --> 00:35:39,830
- We should've been quicker.
- No kidding.

561
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:43,010
- I saw Min Jung showing some attitude.
- When?

562
00:35:43,010 --> 00:35:45,070
'Jong Kook, just tear him to pieces!'

563
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:49,430
Wow, I think that was the first time
I've ever heard anyone say that.

564
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:52,810
I can't believe those words came out
of this sweet actress' mouth.

565
00:35:53,970 --> 00:35:55,840
Our plans for today are
falling apart again.

566
00:35:55,850 --> 00:35:57,790
- Maybe today isn't the day?
- Come on, Suk Jin.

567
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:00,510
- Kwang Soo, let's seriously show them.
- Dong Hoon.

568
00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:02,460
There was nothing I could
do in that game.

569
00:36:03,350 --> 00:36:06,640
If we're not careful, we may not be
able to gain a single hint all day.

570
00:36:06,830 --> 00:36:10,100
Our future is starting to look bleak.
We're all starting to lose hope again.

571
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:11,440
I can't even see the path
in front of us.

572
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:15,310
I also felt like we really didn't mount
too much towards the end of the game.

573
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:23,920
[Han River Public Park in Yeouido.]

574
00:36:24,330 --> 00:36:27,450
<i>This game will test your speed.</i>

575
00:36:27,450 --> 00:36:29,290
<i>Speed?
What is it?</i>

576
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:32,280
<i>- It's a three person relay.
- Okay.</i>

577
00:36:33,790 --> 00:36:37,410
- This is it. This is the game.
- You have to make sure to do your part.

578
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:41,550
<i>Delinquents' specialty,
skipping class for snack time.</i>

579
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:44,310
<i>You've all skipped
your share of classes, right?</i>

580
00:36:44,310 --> 00:36:47,810
We don't do things like that.
We take school very seriously.

581
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:53,390
<i>You are all the types of students who will
skip your classes to run off for snack time.</i>

582
00:36:53,390 --> 00:36:55,970
<i>The second relay player will stand
on top of the hill.</i>

583
00:36:55,970 --> 00:37:00,790
<i>The second relay runner will receive a bag
from the first person and run to the store.</i>

584
00:37:00,790 --> 00:37:06,200
<i>Then the second runner will buy and bag
all of the items that the first person chose</i>

585
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,680
<i>and return to their team.</i>

586
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:11,930
<i>Then the third runner will wait in their spot
for the second runner to return </i>

587
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:16,600
<i>and wrap their bodies in a rug to
roll down the hill.</i>

588
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:20,630
<i>Once down the hill, lay out the rug on
the ground for all three to eat the snacks</i>

589
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:23,770
<i>and the first team to finish eating
their snacks wins this race.</i>

590
00:37:23,770 --> 00:37:25,850
Kwang Soo's good at eating fast
because he has such a large mouth.

591
00:37:25,850 --> 00:37:27,200
I can eat really fast.

592
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:32,520
<i>Is everyone ready?</i>

593
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:33,720
Yes!

594
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:34,890
[Ready]

595
00:37:34,890 --> 00:37:36,690
- Min Jung, fighting!
- Let's win this.

596
00:37:36,690 --> 00:37:38,650
- Ji Hyo!
- Fighting!

597
00:37:38,650 --> 00:37:40,220
[Everyone seems to be confident
about the Skipping Mission.]

598
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:42,130
- I'll put them in this bag.
- Song Ji Hyo, fighting.

599
00:37:42,130 --> 00:37:43,590
- Fighting.
- We really need to get the hint.

600
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:44,620
Okay.

601
00:37:45,410 --> 00:37:48,570
[Time for the first runners to start picking
the snack items written on table tennis balls.]

602
00:37:48,570 --> 00:37:50,830
[Stir fried kimchi.]

603
00:37:50,830 --> 00:37:53,890
[Team Delinquents- Stir-fried kimchi, burger,
roasted chestnuts, cup of ice, chicken leg.]

604
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,050
[Sausage]

605
00:37:57,590 --> 00:38:01,380
[Team Traitors- Sausage, potato chips,
bread, white milk, yogurt.]

606
00:38:02,790 --> 00:38:04,740
[Chocolate]

607
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:08,490
[Team Tiger- Chocolate, warm honey water,
kimbap, cola, hardboiled egg.]

608
00:38:08,490 --> 00:38:11,830
- Why are you looking so glum, Min Jung?
- Not at all, Gary!

609
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:16,080
[Sensing something for Team Tiger.]

610
00:38:16,610 --> 00:38:18,630
Did you hear Min Jung?
'Not at all, Gary!'

611
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:24,930
[All the delinquents are now ready.]

612
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:31,470
Nice, nice!

613
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:39,500
[Big-nosed Brother focusing on the win,
and shoves the girls aside.]

614
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:41,620
- How could you do that to a girl?
- Look at him go.

615
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:43,420
Nice, Jung Myung!

616
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:45,030
[Second runners are off to the store!]

617
00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:49,190
[Enters the store as fast as lightening.]

618
00:38:50,830 --> 00:38:53,010
Where did they go?
Where are all the balls?

619
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:54,910
Bread.

620
00:38:54,910 --> 00:38:56,130
Potato chips.

621
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:59,010
- Potato chips.
- Chicken leg?

622
00:38:59,010 --> 00:39:00,400
Potato chips.

623
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,840

[Team Delinquents- Stir-fried kimchi, burger,
roasted chestnuts, cup of ice, chicken leg.]

625

Where do you keep your pastries?

626
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:12,300
[Team Traitors- Sausage, potato chips,
bread, white milk, yogurt.]

627
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:15,240
[Team Tiger- Chocolate, warm honey water,
kimbap, cola, hardboiled egg.]

628
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:17,390
[Delinquent Ro-Ro is all over the place
looking for the bread.]

629
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:20,140
- Where are the chicken legs?
- They're behind you.

630
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:22,560
I feel like the calm before the storm.

631
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:25,130
Someone's coming.

632
00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:26,590
[Someone already got everything?]

633
00:39:28,850 --> 00:39:31,520
[Delinquent Gary.]

[Team Tiger's Gary is the first to
make it back to his teammates.]

- Where can I get a cup of ice?
- A cup of ice?

637

Yes, a cup of ice.

Bread, bread, bread...

Will it be Jung Myung, or Ro-Ro?]

641

[Third runner, Tiger, getting the rug out
to prepare himself to roll down the hill.]

00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,410
Where is Jung Myung?

645
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:10,790

Hurry!

649
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:23,850
[The Silver Tiger rolling down the hill.]

650
00:40:27,070 --> 00:40:30,080
[Now, it's time to eat their snacks!]

00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:33,580
Hurry!

[This delinquent is rolling down the hill
as if he's bouncing off of it.]

to roll down the hill in her rug.]

00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:55,150
[How far are you going to go?]

656
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:58,870
[Engine Kwang Ja not knowing
how to stop.]

657
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:01,420
- Stop rolling!
- That's enough!

658
00:41:02,550 --> 00:41:05,110
- There's even ice?
- You have to shake it up.

659
00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:10,160
Come over here!

660
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:11,670
I'm really dizzy!

661
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:14,590
[Everyone enjoying their snack time.]

662
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:17,540
- There are only five pieces!
- There's no time for this right now.

663
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:18,990
Hurry up and come over here.

664
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:23,170
You should've bought a smaller one.

665
00:41:23,170 --> 00:41:25,910
[Everyone's sharing their snacks nicely?]

666
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:32,510
[Sausage, potato chips, bread,
white milk, and yogurt.]

667
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:33,820
I will do my best!

668
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:36,030
[I will show you what a good
agent I can be!]

669
00:41:37,730 --> 00:41:41,550
[Eat everything in sight!]

670
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:46,660
I think they're already done eating.

671
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:50,110
[Team Tiger is almost done
with their snacks.]

672
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:56,210
[Giving the Tiger a piece of chocolate?]

673
00:41:56,210 --> 00:41:59,610
[Which is immediately fed to Gary.]

674
00:41:59,610 --> 00:42:01,150
There's another piece, Jong Kook.

675
00:42:02,410 --> 00:42:04,100
Here, eat it.

676
00:42:06,150 --> 00:42:08,500
[Eating with determination.]

677
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:14,290
[Let's just finish this all up.]

678
00:42:23,410 --> 00:42:24,750
That team's already done eating.

679
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:38,180
[Success?]

680
00:42:39,090 --> 00:42:40,610
<i>Okay, Red Team passes.</i>

681
00:42:40,610 --> 00:42:42,600
[Team Tiger succeeds!]

682
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:48,900
[Time to determine the second place
between the two teams.]

683
00:42:50,830 --> 00:42:53,340
[Hamburger]

684
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:55,290
I can tell that they picked
something bad.

685
00:42:55,290 --> 00:42:56,540
I can tell.

686
00:42:57,580 --> 00:42:59,770
[Less burdensome, roasted chestnuts.]

687
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:04,630
[Following the hamburger,
his next draw is, fishcake skewer.]

688
00:43:04,630 --> 00:43:06,240
You have to choose carefully,
Jung Myung.

689
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:10,450
[One container of ice cream.]

690
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:14,860
- Can I re-pick?
- You can't do that.

691
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:16,960
No, this isn't right.

692
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:18,520
What did you pick?

693
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:21,020
Can I take a look before I pick?

694
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:24,730
You can't do that.

695
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:26,910
Fair play, please.

696
00:43:30,490 --> 00:43:31,730
How many have you picked so far?

697
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:34,940
Your stomachs are going to explode.

698
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:36,370
[Chicken skewer]

699
00:43:38,870 --> 00:43:40,600
Your stomachs are going to explode.

700

I'm seriously going to lose my mind.

701
00:43:45,030 --> 00:43:46,300
You can't look.

702
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:49,770
What are you doing?
You can't look.

703

[His last snack item is...]

704
00:43:52,810 --> 00:43:55,210
[Bread]

705
00:43:57,980 --> 00:43:59,750
- Why is he laughing like that?
- What did you pick?

706
00:44:00,450 --> 00:44:02,490
- We're in big trouble.
- Jung Myung!

707
00:44:02,490 --> 00:44:04,630
- Yes?
- What did you pick?

708
00:44:04,630 --> 00:44:06,450
I really am so sorry.

709
00:44:07,850 --> 00:44:09,500

fishcake skewer, burger, a tub of ice cream.]

710

[Team Traitors- A cup of ice, sausage,
stir-fried kimchi, roasted chestnuts, yogurt.]

711
00:44:17,010 --> 00:44:19,460
- Shouldn't he be back by now?
- What is he doing?

712
00:44:19,460 --> 00:44:21,920
[Huh?
Gary coming onto the scene?]

713
00:44:23,070 --> 00:44:26,800
[To protect Blank Ji?]

714
00:44:29,670 --> 00:44:34,160
[What is he...]

715
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:40,640
[Their menu is much simpler
compared to their opposing team's.]

716
00:44:42,740 --> 00:44:44,870
[A feast fit for a king for this team.]

717
00:44:44,870 --> 00:44:47,780
Those guys... wow, look at them.

718
00:44:47,780 --> 00:44:50,700
Look at the way he's eating
that ice cream.

719
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:53,350
We're not here on a picnic, Jung Myung!

720
00:44:54,050 --> 00:44:56,370
You're acting like we're out here
on a picnic right now.

721
00:44:58,090 --> 00:44:59,590
[Want some?]

722
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:04,160
[Team Traitors is already preparing
themselves to whistle.]

723
00:45:04,770 --> 00:45:05,960
I'll whistle first.

724

<i>I can't believe you picked
all this stuff.</i>

725
00:45:13,340 --> 00:45:15,430
- Okay.
- Yay!

726
00:45:15,430 --> 00:45:16,880
[Team Traitors succeeds.]

727
00:45:16,890 --> 00:45:19,310
- Today's the day.
- Today really is the day.

728
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:21,610
I'm sorry.

729
00:45:24,530 --> 00:45:27,220
[Team Tiger gets the first hint for
coming in at first place.]

730
00:45:29,390 --> 00:45:30,890
What are you doing?

731
00:45:30,890 --> 00:45:33,840
[This delinquent gets caught trying to
steal the other team's hint.]

732
00:45:35,380 --> 00:45:37,620
[Team Tiger chooses hint number one.]

733
00:45:37,620 --> 00:45:39,540
- You're good at picking things like that.
- Okay.

734
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:41,220
[Team Traitors chooses hint number two.]

735
00:45:42,610 --> 00:45:45,290
Don't even look at Jung Myung.
You have to be careful.

<i>[Fifth floor]</i>

You didn't see, did you?

739
00:45:56,770 --> 00:45:57,920
No, I did see.

740
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:00,120
It's a three letter word, isn't it?

741
00:46:01,150 --> 00:46:03,670

Off to the next location.]

[Go to the boxing ring in Sungbookdong.]

744
00:46:11,070 --> 00:46:13,390
We're going to a boxing ring.
I wonder what we'll have to do there.

745
00:46:13,390 --> 00:46:15,850
- Oh my, a boxing arena?
- Yeah.

746
00:46:15,850 --> 00:46:17,990
You don't think
they expect us to spar, do you?

747
00:46:17,990 --> 00:46:20,090
Come on, no way!

748
00:46:21,390 --> 00:46:23,790
[Arriving at the third mission location.]

749
00:46:27,370 --> 00:46:30,360
[Welcome to the boxing ring.]

750
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:34,030
[Legendary delinquents-
Let's see what you've got in the ring!]

751
00:46:34,030 --> 00:46:35,640
What is this? Are we really going to
do something in the ring?

752
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:38,640
Why are you even trying to get in there?

753
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:40,700
[His legs are too short...]

754
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:42,400
Get in through the lower rung.

to manage even with long legs...]

'The Legendary Fist is Crying.'</i>

- The first is crying?
- It's happening for real today.

758
00:46:57,550 --> 00:46:59,390
Can you let the girls
go up against one another?

759
00:46:59,390 --> 00:47:02,990
[Kwang Ja wanting to go up against
the girls for being a 'girl' today.]

760
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,760
- That's what I'd like.
- Okay, I understand.

761
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:06,070
Song Ji Hyo, get out here.

762

[You should be more careful about
who you choose as your opponent?]

763
00:47:11,580 --> 00:47:15,720
<i>Choose a representative from each team
to get in the ring with the gloves on.</i>

764
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:16,870
- Yes?
- Then what?

765
00:47:16,910 --> 00:47:20,680
<i>While that person is in the ring warming up,
that's when the mission will be told to them.</i>

766
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:24,370
- So the person has to be in the ring first.
- There's no knockout punch, right?

767
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:27,510
Isn't the person that breaks down crying
the loser of the round?

768
00:47:27,510 --> 00:47:28,890
If the person's nose starts to bleed,
then that person loses.

769
00:47:28,890 --> 00:47:31,220
<i>Even though many
different situation may arise...</i>

770
00:47:31,220 --> 00:47:33,940

[What do I do...]

776
00:47:45,660 --> 00:47:48,640
Not a single person from our team
has any experience with boxing.

00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:51,010
Look at how Jung Myung is helping
Jae Suk with the gloves.

[Players for the first round-
Jae Suk, Gary, and Suk Jin.]

your glasses.</i>

- My glasses?
- In case you get hit in the face.

783

[Is there going to be a real match?]

784
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:17,070
<i>The three players must come
into the ring.</i>

[Time to warm up.
Three players to the center of the ring.]

786
00:48:21,130 --> 00:48:23,160
Keep that up and
you'll give yourself a nosebleed.

Why?
Do you want a nosebleed?

788
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:27,160
You don't want to give yourself
a nosebleed, do you?

789
00:48:27,170 --> 00:48:29,330
- Do you want a nosebleed?
- Why, do you want one?

790
00:48:30,110 --> 00:48:32,860
Gary, can I ruin your face
some more?

791
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:35,670
There's nothing you can do
to ruin it any further.

792

My face is already at its worst.

793

Suk Jin looks like he's already
been through a round in the ring.

[Boxer Gae slowly finding his rhythm.]

Why are you doing that to me?

801
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:04,220
Why are you treating a girl that way?

802
00:49:11,170 --> 00:49:13,350
Seriously!
You just hit me for real!

who do you think you're punching?

805
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:29,270
- Come on, Suk Jin!
- Is my nose bleeding?

806
00:49:29,980 --> 00:49:32,500
[One person who can't seem to
join the others in their laughter...]

807
00:49:33,390 --> 00:49:34,780
You don't think we'll be
boxing for real, right?

808
00:49:34,780 --> 00:49:36,200
We can't go up against Gary.
What was that?

809
00:49:37,020 --> 00:49:41,530
[Then sound of the bell could be heard,
and what's that bowl for?]

810

What is that?

811
00:49:43,170 --> 00:49:44,310
[What could it be?]

812
00:49:44,310 --> 00:49:47,170
[Pick up the bowl and
break it over your opponent's head.]

with their gloved hands.]

I've got this.

817
00:50:02,590 --> 00:50:06,260
[Leaping into the air to break it
over Gary's head.]

818

[It probably hurts even more
since it didn't break...]

820

You're doing great, Ji Suk Jin!

821

00:50:23,110 --> 00:50:26,080
[Boxer Gae sees his chance,
and goes after  the bowl!]

824
00:50:26,970 --> 00:50:28,900
The bowl didn't break.

825
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:34,640
[Wow... again!]

826
00:50:34,650 --> 00:50:36,850
[Almost broke his head in his attempt
to break the bowl.]

827
00:50:36,850 --> 00:50:38,240
- It didn't break.
- I don't think it broke.

828
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:39,790
- It's not breaking easily.
- Go after Jae Suk.

829
00:50:39,790 --> 00:50:41,230
[Their fear escalates as the bowl
remains unbroken.]

830
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:46,820
[Hitting it directly on
the point of his hat.]

831
00:50:49,300 --> 00:50:52,530
[Boxer Gae sees
the perfect opportunity this time.]

832
00:50:55,460 --> 00:50:58,130
[At last... it's broken.]

833
00:50:59,660 --> 00:51:03,300
[Round one- Break the bowl.
Boxer Gae wins.]

834
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:05,920
Sorry for that.

835
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:08,560
- I grabbed the bowl first.
- What the heck.

836
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:12,070
- Okay, next players into the ring.
- Just go for it, Jung Myung.

837
00:51:12,070 --> 00:51:14,520
Since Jung Myung's going in,
you have to get in there.

838
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:16,360
Why would I go in there?

839
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:21,390
[And Mr. Capable too!]

840
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:23,910
[Scared to death.]

841
00:51:25,980 --> 00:51:29,600
[Kkuk showing off his boxing skills
in an attempt to intimidate others.]

842
00:51:30,170 --> 00:51:32,300
His jabs are pretty slow.

843
00:51:32,300 --> 00:51:35,960
The jabs are actually supposed to be short
like that when you're boxing.

844
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:40,010
You're good.

845
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:42,870
[Kkuk receiving compliments
from the little kid.]

846
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:46,870
You're a shy one, aren't you?

847
00:51:48,620 --> 00:51:50,350
Hit like a man!

848
00:51:56,860 --> 00:52:00,210
[Ro-Ro's 'Hollywood style' boxing that
does nothing but disorients others.]

849
00:52:00,660 --> 00:52:02,500
[His version of Ali's moves.]

850
00:52:09,110 --> 00:52:10,690
You want to do this for real?

851
00:52:10,690 --> 00:52:11,730
Don't get yourself worked up for nothing.

852
00:52:11,730 --> 00:52:13,400
I know what it feels like
not to be able to do anything about it.

853
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:18,710
- There really is nothing you can do about it.
- The only thing I can do is call my mom.

854
00:52:18,710 --> 00:52:20,370
[Calling his mom is the
only thing he can do?]

855
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:23,010
Jung Myung is looking for his chance.

856
00:52:24,660 --> 00:52:27,370
[He really is all over the place...]

857
00:52:28,750 --> 00:52:30,560
We're all warmed up.

858
00:52:31,060 --> 00:52:32,860
I'm already starting to
sweat over here.

859
00:52:37,370 --> 00:52:38,970
Come on, why don't you shadowbox?

860
00:52:39,450 --> 00:52:41,440
[Time for the mission!]

861
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:42,800
[Huh?]

862
00:52:43,050 --> 00:52:45,230
[A 500 won coin?]

863
00:52:47,130 --> 00:52:50,430
[Pick up the coin in put it in the piggybank.]

864
00:52:53,030 --> 00:52:56,110
[Jung Myung shoves Mr. Capable aside.]

865
00:52:57,080 --> 00:52:59,770
[Not easy to pick up the coin
with their gloved hands.]

866
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:02,660
[While Mr. Capable is briefly out of it...]

867
00:53:06,020 --> 00:53:08,050
[Oh my goodness...]

868
00:53:09,530 --> 00:53:11,610
[He's got it!]

869
00:53:11,610 --> 00:53:14,060
[Here's the piggybank.]

870
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:22,100
Jong Kook, come here and
do something!

871
00:53:22,100 --> 00:53:24,320
- Come and do something!
- Jong Kook!

872
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:27,220
[During that time...
Jung Myung succeeds!]

873
00:53:27,220 --> 00:53:30,670
[The legendary fist-
The second round goes to Jung Myung!]

874
00:53:32,140 --> 00:53:34,210
[A celebration over his win.]

875
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:40,280
He did great and won while Jong Kook
was out of it and just lying there.

876
00:53:40,860 --> 00:53:43,880
I think I got whiplash
when he body checked me.

877
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:46,370
- That's how you play this game.
- I lost consciousness.

878
00:53:46,370 --> 00:53:48,700
That's what you do to us
every single week.

879
00:53:48,700 --> 00:53:50,540
I'm telling you that I lost
consciousness there for a moment.

880
00:53:50,540 --> 00:53:52,540
Why doesn't anyone care about
what happens to me?

881
00:53:52,540 --> 00:53:54,090
I'm a person too!

882
00:53:54,090 --> 00:53:56,690
[Ah... you are?]

883
00:53:56,690 --> 00:54:02,010
[Mr. Capable is... a human being too...]

884
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:06,940
[Round three-
A match between the women.]

885
00:54:06,940 --> 00:54:11,510
[Secret agent Kwang Ja with
a determined gleam in her eyes.]

886
00:54:11,510 --> 00:54:14,350
Ji Hyo, when he's acting like that,
punch him in the upper lip.

887
00:54:17,730 --> 00:54:19,610
So that his lips look like this,
and he can't even talk afterward.

888
00:54:21,090 --> 00:54:23,390
[Wait...]

889
00:54:24,340 --> 00:54:27,860
[Let's try to remember something about
these people from the information sheet...]

890
00:54:27,860 --> 00:54:29,710
[Song Ji Hyo- The beautiful delinquent who
rules all of Ilsan.]

891
00:54:29,710 --> 00:54:31,480
[Kim Min Jung- Dubbed 'Queen of the night'.
No further details.]

892
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:32,660
I've got it.

893
00:54:33,950 --> 00:54:37,740
[I'm Lee Kwang Ja...
I will uphold the pride of my position.]

894
00:54:37,740 --> 00:54:40,600
[Girls... come at me.]

895
00:54:42,900 --> 00:54:45,780
[The legendary fist- Round three.]

896
00:54:45,780 --> 00:54:47,830
You're doing good, Lee Kwang Soo.

897
00:54:47,830 --> 00:54:49,400
[Checking each other out first.]

898
00:54:51,350 --> 00:54:53,180
I can see Ji Hyo assuming the
correct stance.

899
00:54:54,580 --> 00:54:57,940
- I can see Ji Hyo wanting to do it for real.
- She looks like she wants to box for real.

900
00:54:57,950 --> 00:55:00,070
I actually learned how to box in the past.

901
00:55:00,070 --> 00:55:01,620
- Seriously?
- For real?

902
00:55:01,620 --> 00:55:03,130
Wait.

903
00:55:03,130 --> 00:55:06,260
- You really took boxing lessons?
- I took lessons for a few months.

904
00:55:06,270 --> 00:55:09,300
- That's quite a long time.
- Did you master everything within that time?

905
00:55:15,700 --> 00:55:16,840
Wait.

906
00:55:20,370 --> 00:55:25,880
[Kwang Ja pretends to lose her balance
to throw herself on Min Jung.]

907
00:55:27,230 --> 00:55:28,770
Who cares?
We're all girls in here.

908
00:55:29,950 --> 00:55:31,260
Is he out of his mind?

909
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:34,330
[It's getting to that time...]

910
00:55:34,330 --> 00:55:36,160
[The sound of the mission is heard.]

911
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:40,320
[Grab the stick and hit the xylophone.]

912
00:55:40,650 --> 00:55:44,580
[Grab the stick and hit the xylophone.]

913
00:55:46,230 --> 00:55:47,570
- You're doing good.
- Ji Hyo.

914
00:55:48,980 --> 00:55:50,880
[Grab the stick and hit the xylophone!]

915
00:55:53,410 --> 00:55:56,000
[Min Jung resorting to manhandling Ji Hyo.]

916
00:55:57,280 --> 00:56:00,140
[Women's round is proving to be a
bloodier battle than the men's!]

917
00:56:00,140 --> 00:56:04,580
[While the other two girls are fighting,
Kwang Ja goes after the stick.]

918
00:56:05,820 --> 00:56:07,260
Grab it by the rounder end!

919
00:56:08,380 --> 00:56:11,480
[An advantageous situation for Kwang Ja!]

920
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:15,870
[Can't reach so fails to hit the xylophone!]

921
00:56:20,030 --> 00:56:22,270
[Kwang Ja drops the stick.]

922
00:56:22,270 --> 00:56:24,900
[Who will win this round?]

923
00:56:29,610 --> 00:56:31,190
Hey, she has no respect for you!

924
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:33,990
[I'm going to ride on
your back for a moment, Ji Hyo.]

925
00:56:33,990 --> 00:56:35,610
She has no respect for you
during this game.

926
00:56:41,570 --> 00:56:44,470
[Takes care of Kwang Ja
with one single punch.]

927
00:56:48,380 --> 00:56:51,860
[Even if everyone is laughing at me...]

928
00:56:51,870 --> 00:56:55,710
[I'm Lee Kwang Ja, the undercover cop!]

929
00:56:55,710 --> 00:56:59,400
[Kwang Ja gets back on his feet,
and goes back to punching Blank Ji.]

930
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:08,960
[Blank Ji Hyo explodes!]

931
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:11,710
[Beating him up with the stick?]

932
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:15,270
[You are still alive, aren't you?]

933
00:57:16,180 --> 00:57:19,020
[Blank Ji succeeds in getting her hands
on the xylophone stick.]

934
00:57:19,710 --> 00:57:21,880
[A full body block.]

935
00:57:23,180 --> 00:57:25,570
What are you doing with your gloved hand?
Punch Kwang Soo!

936
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:30,010
[Take Blank Ji's punch!]

937
00:57:30,020 --> 00:57:33,160
[Kwang Ja is knocked out!]

938
00:57:33,160 --> 00:57:35,400
Just leave him down there, Ji Hyo.

939
00:57:36,010 --> 00:57:38,100
[Don't you dare act out to me.]

940
00:57:39,250 --> 00:57:40,990
Do you really need to go that far?

941
00:57:41,310 --> 00:57:44,160
- What is going on here?
- Watch out for Ji Hyo's left punch.

942
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:46,890
[Ace Ji Hyo's undeniable punch.
Truly a work of someone experienced.]

943
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:48,690
Get it away from her!

944
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:55,740
[Are you trying to eat it?]

945
00:57:55,740 --> 00:57:58,000
[Kwang catfish tries to
swallow the stick whole.]

946
00:57:59,310 --> 00:58:00,670
Hey, Chun Jung Myung!

947
00:58:01,470 --> 00:58:04,870
[Jung Myung grabs onto Kwang catfish
from outside the ring.]

948
00:58:04,870 --> 00:58:07,270
[Is this pro wrestling?]

949
00:58:07,270 --> 00:58:10,350
- Is the judge seeing this?
- You have to call out on that one!

950
00:58:11,310 --> 00:58:15,160
[In the midst of all that chaos...
the stick falls into Min Jung's hand.]

951
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:22,470
[Min Jung takes the stick... and clang!]

952
00:58:22,470 --> 00:58:24,190
[My goodness...]

953
00:58:24,190 --> 00:58:26,800
[Min Jung comes out of nowhere
and wins the round!]

954
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:28,510
Jung Myung grabbed Kwang Soo.

955
00:58:28,620 --> 00:58:31,970
[The final verdict on Jung Myung's
participation from outside the ring?]

956
00:58:31,970 --> 00:58:35,820
<i>Following the rules of WWE when it
comes to aiding your teammate...</i>

957
00:58:35,820 --> 00:58:37,240
What are you saying?

958
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:38,950
I thought that this was boxing!

959
00:58:38,950 --> 00:58:41,060
That just means that don't come
anywhere near him.

960
00:58:41,060 --> 00:58:44,230
Thus, the Red Team wins the game.

961
00:58:44,230 --> 00:58:46,950
[Team Tiger wins the Legendary Fist Game.]

962
00:58:47,450 --> 00:58:51,270
[Oh... this isn't good.]

963
00:58:53,140 --> 00:58:54,830
- Okay, we've got the first place team.
- Yes.

964
00:58:54,830 --> 00:58:57,750
It's now time to determine which of
the other teams will come in at second place.

965
00:58:57,750 --> 00:59:01,210
Once you start to warm up,
we'll give you your mission.

966
00:59:01,210 --> 00:59:02,550
We have to come in at second place, Ji Hyo.

967
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,600
It doesn't matter that we didn't win first,
but we just need to come in at second place.

968
00:59:05,730 --> 00:59:07,840
[Time to warm up first.]

969
00:59:07,840 --> 00:59:10,420
This is no time to go easy on her
just because she's a girl.

970
00:59:10,420 --> 00:59:11,940
It's all over for us if we lose this round.

971
00:59:13,660 --> 00:59:17,470
[Blank Ji's stable stance.]

972
00:59:18,780 --> 00:59:22,340
You're not doing it right.
Ji Hyo's much better than you.

973
00:59:28,050 --> 00:59:30,130
You have to lead with the left hand.

974
00:59:30,130 --> 00:59:31,320
- Kim Jong Kook.
- Yeah?

975
00:59:31,320 --> 00:59:33,810
I'm looking forward to when
you turn 80 years old.

976
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:37,460
I'm just waiting until you become
an octogenarian.

977
00:59:37,460 --> 00:59:39,440
[I will get my revenge once you become
a weak octogenarian.]

978
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:41,830
[He's still too much of a threat at 70,
so he's waiting until he turns 80.]

979
00:59:45,590 --> 00:59:48,480
[Grab the pen and
lift it up above your head to win!]

980
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:51,780
[There's nothing else left to lose!]

981
00:59:55,860 --> 00:59:57,780
Why aren't you using your fists?
There you go.

982
00:59:57,780 --> 00:59:59,270
Use your fists, Ji Hyo.

983
00:59:59,270 --> 01:00:00,670
Ji Hyo.

984
01:00:03,240 --> 01:00:05,560
[Blank Ji is putting him in a leg lock?]

985
01:00:07,460 --> 01:00:10,340
[Unbelievable.]

986
01:00:11,510 --> 01:00:14,410
[Blank Ji...
is there anything that she can't do?]

987
01:00:14,410 --> 01:00:15,820
Ji Hyo!

988
01:00:17,140 --> 01:00:19,870
[Wonder woman Song Ji Hyo!]

989
01:00:26,040 --> 01:00:28,380
[Ruining Haroro's self-confidence.]

990
01:00:38,900 --> 01:00:42,640
[Wonder woman and
angry little kid's fierce battle.]

991
01:00:44,320 --> 01:00:46,870
[The pen is in Haroro's hand!]

992
01:00:48,140 --> 01:00:51,540
[This battle has turned into a battle
of pride between these two delinquents.]

993
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:57,060
[Amazing!
Blank Ji is attempting to leg trip him?]

994
01:01:00,070 --> 01:01:01,690
I'm sorry, but can you give me a break?

995
01:01:02,330 --> 01:01:05,370
[Realizing that he can't take her by strength,
so he resorts to begging?]

996
01:01:06,130 --> 01:01:07,890
My mother-in-law is watching this.

997
01:01:08,750 --> 01:01:11,640
[Mother-in-law...
Can you turn off your TV for a moment?]

998
01:01:13,370 --> 01:01:16,180
Hit him on his side, Ji Hyo.

999
01:01:18,830 --> 01:01:21,700
[No other choice but to do this
in order to get the hint.]

1000
01:01:21,700 --> 01:01:22,840
Nice.

1001
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:32,010
[Just then...
he stands from his stance!]

1002
01:01:44,190 --> 01:01:49,540
[I'm... a dad!]

1003
01:01:51,380 --> 01:01:54,710
[A round of applause breaks out over
his lifting of the pen!]

1004
01:01:55,570 --> 01:02:00,750
[I'm... a man!]

1005
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:05,240
[An emotional ceremony
to celebrate his victory.]

1006
01:02:08,310 --> 01:02:11,320
[Head-butts... the camera.]

1007
01:02:13,120 --> 01:02:17,280
[Finishing off the touching ceremony
with a huge burst of laughter.]

1008
01:02:20,720 --> 01:02:22,350
- Good job, Ji Hyo.
- You're awesome.

1009
01:02:24,550 --> 01:02:28,680
<i>Ji Suk Jin, Ha Ha, and Lee Kwang Ja
takes second place.</i>

1010
01:02:28,680 --> 01:02:31,700
<i>Only those two teams will
get their hands on another hint.</i>

1011
01:02:33,580 --> 01:02:35,780
[First place winner- The Tiger Team.]

1012
01:02:35,790 --> 01:02:38,350
[Chooses envelope number one.]

1013
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:42,970
[Team Traitors sticks to their previous choice
and selects envelope number two again.]

1014
01:02:43,170 --> 01:02:47,100
- Korean History museum.
- Go to Korean History Museum.

1015
01:02:47,100 --> 01:02:48,520
I wonder what that hint means?

1016
01:02:48,520 --> 01:02:50,980
Gallery.
Fifth floor.

1017
01:02:50,990 --> 01:02:53,210
So it means the gallery on
the fifth floor?

1018
01:02:53,210 --> 01:02:56,090
Let's just go up to the gallery
on the fifth floor as soon as we get there.

1019
01:02:56,090 --> 01:02:58,460
- Okay.
- We have to see what's up there.

1020
01:02:59,310 --> 01:03:01,740
We're in big trouble with
only one hint.

1021
01:03:01,740 --> 01:03:04,570
But we still have
Chun Jung Myung on our team.

1022
01:03:04,570 --> 01:03:08,180
[Having Jung Myung on their team is more
reassuring than having the hints?]

1023
01:03:08,180 --> 01:03:09,840
Why are you suddenly saying that?

1024
01:03:10,300 --> 01:03:12,170
- You all did great.
- Where is this place?

1025
01:03:14,520 --> 01:03:18,580
[Secret agent Lee Kwang Ja-
Heading to the final location.]

1026
01:03:19,030 --> 01:03:22,220
- We can do it as long as we're determined.
- This is the final round.

1027
01:03:22,220 --> 01:03:25,710
- Let's look at the hint.
- We chose number two both times.

1028
01:03:25,710 --> 01:03:27,740
Let's see what it says.
The gallery?

1029
01:03:28,030 --> 01:03:30,180
[First hint- gallery.]

1030
01:03:30,780 --> 01:03:34,050
[And the second hint that
they just gained...]

1031
01:03:34,620 --> 01:03:37,150
- Wait.
- What? The gallery again?

1032
01:03:37,150 --> 01:03:39,520
[Gallery]

1033
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:41,760
- The writers!
- Seriously?

1034
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:46,760
[All the same numbers mean
the same hint.]

1035
01:03:47,430 --> 01:03:50,940
Then it means that we're not any further
ahead than the team in the last place.

1036
01:03:50,940 --> 01:03:55,760
[Okay... this isn't a bad situation for me,
since I'm the secret agent here.]

1037
01:03:57,740 --> 01:04:01,060
[The final location-
Republic of Korea's History Museum.]

1038
01:04:01,490 --> 01:04:03,920
We don't really know anything,
so we're in big trouble.

1039
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:07,400
- The only hint we have is the World Cup.
- Yes, World Cup.

1040
01:04:08,490 --> 01:04:10,410
It's the gallery, right?

1041
01:04:10,710 --> 01:04:14,760
[How unfortunate for them...
Two of the same hints.]

1042
01:04:16,590 --> 01:04:19,430
- Let's do this.
- Today really is the day.

1043
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:22,310
- This has to be our day.
- I can't believe we got the same hint.

1044
01:04:22,310 --> 01:04:24,340
[Wait a minute... earlier...]

1045
01:04:24,340 --> 01:04:28,800
<i>We will give you your mission once you arrive
at the final location without others knowing.</i>

1046
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:30,140
<i>Secretly?</i>

1047
01:04:32,010 --> 01:04:35,310
[I can't get caught...]

1048
01:04:37,950 --> 01:04:39,320
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1049
01:04:39,320 --> 01:04:41,610
[Getting on the elevator to
find the gallery.]

1050
01:04:41,610 --> 01:04:44,250
- I don't want to lose.
- I really want to win today.

1051
01:04:45,100 --> 01:04:49,340
[Kwang Ja looking for a way away from
them as not to arouse their suspicion.]

1052
01:04:49,350 --> 01:04:53,720
[His expression always looking so dour
whenever he tries to lie.]

1053
01:04:55,130 --> 01:04:56,570
I'm so sick and tired of losing.

1054
01:04:57,870 --> 01:04:59,320
Look, there's the gallery.

1055
01:04:59,320 --> 01:05:01,580
- Our hint said the gallery, right?
- The gallery.

1056
01:05:02,080 --> 01:05:06,300
[I have to get away from these guys
so that I can get my mission.]

1057
01:05:07,300 --> 01:05:10,020
Okay, we're here at the gallery.
I think we should start searching.

1058
01:05:10,020 --> 01:05:11,340
I wonder if there's something
inside the gallery?

1059
01:05:11,340 --> 01:05:12,630
Watch your backs.

1060
01:05:12,630 --> 01:05:16,220
[Everyone's focusing
on searching the gallery.]

1061
01:05:17,040 --> 01:05:19,040
[Just then...]

1062
01:05:19,040 --> 01:05:25,080
[Kwang Ja sneaks away from
the rest of his teammates.]

1063
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:33,070
It's top secret information.

1064
01:05:34,340 --> 01:05:36,960
<i>[The legendary book bag is amongst the nine
bags that each student is carrying.]</i>

1065
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:38,660
<i>[The real book bag is marked with a symbol.]</i>

1066
01:05:38,660 --> 01:05:41,690
<i>[The legendary book bag is one of
the nine bags that they're carrying!]</i>

1067
01:05:42,360 --> 01:05:46,570
[One of the nine bags that they've been
carrying all day is the legendary book bag!]

1068
01:05:46,570 --> 01:05:48,610
<i>The real book bag is marked
with a symbol.</i>

1069
01:05:48,610 --> 01:05:52,450
<i>[Once the bag is found,
find the secret document inside the bag.]</i>

1070
01:05:52,730 --> 01:05:54,940
<i>[And oust all other student members.]</i>

1071
01:05:55,230 --> 01:05:59,660
[Secret mission-
Oust all other student members.]

1072
01:06:02,600 --> 01:06:06,960
[I have to... oust these guys?]

1073
01:06:07,690 --> 01:06:09,580
I have to oust all the other students?

1074
01:06:13,270 --> 01:06:15,940
Just the fact that I'm still alive
is a miracle in itself.

1075
01:06:18,690 --> 01:06:20,580
How am to supposed to oust
all of them?

1076
01:06:23,710 --> 01:06:31,350
[All those scary delinquents...
and I'm to oust them all by myself?]

1077
01:06:32,460 --> 01:06:34,950
[The sudden terror and trepidation.]

1078
01:06:35,350 --> 01:06:37,690
No one else knows that I'm an
undercover cop, do they?

1079
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:42,710
[Since no one knows my true identity...]

1080
01:06:42,710 --> 01:06:48,100
[I still have a fighting chance.]

1081
01:06:49,810 --> 01:06:51,650
The gallery on the fifth floor.

1082
01:06:51,650 --> 01:06:55,790
[Team Tiger with the most
amount of hints heads up to the gallery.]

1083
01:06:55,790 --> 01:07:00,670
[Deducing that the legendary book bag is
somewhere in the gallery on the fifth floor.]

1084
01:07:01,630 --> 01:07:04,900
We have to search all the likely places.
It could be enclosed in a display like this.

1085
01:07:04,900 --> 01:07:06,600
Yeah, we have to search very carefully.

1086
01:07:10,390 --> 01:07:12,720
[Huh?]

1087
01:07:15,230 --> 01:07:19,440
[Min Jung is looking a little suspicious...]

1088
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:22,650
[Why is she suddenly looking so alert?]

1089
01:07:26,480 --> 01:07:30,650
[Carefully pulls out a cellphone...]

1090
01:07:30,650 --> 01:07:32,190
I bet something is hidden around here.

1091
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:38,110
Search around in the inside, Jong Kook.
I'll go search the outside parameters.

1092
01:07:40,660 --> 01:07:44,530
[Walks away from her teammates to walk
into an empty room all by herself?]

1093
01:07:55,710 --> 01:07:58,710
[Wait... this is?]

1094
01:08:05,980 --> 01:08:10,400
[It's the exact same text
that Kwang Ja received!]

1095
01:08:11,730 --> 01:08:17,470
[Just why did Min Jung receive the same
mission text as Kwang Ja did?]

1096
01:08:17,470 --> 01:08:23,300
[Just what is the identity of
this woman?]

1097
01:08:28,350 --> 01:08:30,640
[7 a.m. this morning.]

1098
01:08:31,500 --> 01:08:36,520
[A lone woman walks into an empty cafe.]

1099
01:08:38,240 --> 01:08:40,950
[What is Kim Min Jung doing here?]

1100
01:08:40,950 --> 01:08:42,710
Agent Kim Min Jung.

1101
01:08:44,300 --> 01:08:46,200
- It's nice to meet you.
- Yes, me too.

1102
01:08:46,520 --> 01:08:48,980
You graduated from the academy
at the top of your class

1103
01:08:48,980 --> 01:08:51,600
and you did an outstanding job of
capturing the criminal in Thailand.

1104
01:08:52,500 --> 01:08:56,220
I have a special mission for one of our
top agents, which is you.

1105
01:08:57,130 --> 01:09:01,300
[The truth is, Min Jung has been
a secret agent all along!]

1106
01:09:01,300 --> 01:09:07,030
[She was given the same order that
secret agent Kwang Ja received.]

1107
01:09:07,550 --> 01:09:12,020
So that means...
one, two, three, four... one against eight?

1108
01:09:12,020 --> 01:09:14,570
Can't at least one of them
be on my side?

1109
01:09:14,580 --> 01:09:17,210
I can't really tell you that.

1110
01:09:19,400 --> 01:09:21,410
So that must mean that there's
at least one person on my side.

1111
01:09:25,580 --> 01:09:28,870
[Agent Lee Kwang Ja
and Agent Kim Min Jung.]

1112
01:09:28,870 --> 01:09:32,340
[Each going undercover without
the knowledge of the other's existence.]

1113
01:09:32,340 --> 01:09:35,430
[They're not aware of
each other's existence.]

1114
01:09:36,800 --> 01:09:43,870
[Kim Min Jung was another
undercover agent all along.]

1115
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:48,970
[Casually infiltrating the ring of delinquents
as 'The Queen of the Night'.]

1116
01:09:48,970 --> 01:09:53,860
[Min Jung having perfected her mission of
going undercover and hiding her identity.]

1117
01:09:53,860 --> 01:10:01,970
[This is the reason why she worked
so hard all day to win.]

1118
01:10:01,970 --> 01:10:03,350
I'm sorry, guys.

1119
01:10:05,390 --> 01:10:10,540
[Since it'll be tough for me to oust them all
on my own, I'll utilize my team members.]

1120
01:10:11,780 --> 01:10:15,950
[And the other secret agent over here.]

1121
01:10:17,650 --> 01:10:20,170
- Gary.
- What is it? You startled me.

1122
01:10:20,810 --> 01:10:25,850
[The two undercover agents facing off with one
another without knowing each other's identity.]

1123
01:10:25,850 --> 01:10:27,910
We have to eliminate each other's
name tags, right?

1124
01:10:27,950 --> 01:10:33,570
[Wait... how did she know that?]

1125
01:10:33,570 --> 01:10:37,520
[I was sure that the delinquents only knew of
the mission to find the legendary book bag?]

1126
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:39,900
Why are you thinking that this is a
name tag elimination race?

1127
01:10:40,460 --> 01:10:42,170
- This isn't a name tag elimination.
- You startled me.

1128
01:10:42,170 --> 01:10:44,300
I thought we had to eliminate
each other's name tags.

1129
01:10:44,300 --> 01:10:46,590
[Min Jung suggesting that all the delinquents
eliminate each other's name tags.]

1130
01:10:46,590 --> 01:10:48,210
I thought that the winner was whomever
that found the book bag?

1131
01:10:48,210 --> 01:10:50,300
I thought that the person who found the
book bag was the winner of the race.

1132
01:10:51,070 --> 01:10:54,260
[The undercover agents...]

1133
01:10:54,260 --> 01:10:57,870
[With two different plans...]

1134
01:11:00,640 --> 01:11:03,480
[Wait...]

1135
01:11:03,480 --> 01:11:05,650
<i>Can't one of them be on my side?</i>

1136
01:11:05,650 --> 01:11:09,070
[I'm sure that there's at least
one other undercover agent here...]

1137
01:11:09,900 --> 01:11:13,140
[Just which one could it be?]

1138
01:11:13,140 --> 01:11:16,910
[Will these two be able to realize
each other's identity?]

1139
01:11:18,820 --> 01:11:19,990
The legendary book bag.

1140
01:11:19,990 --> 01:11:24,550
[Delinquent Jong Kook firmly believing in
his hunch that the book bag is hidden here.]

1141
01:11:24,970 --> 01:11:26,840
I wonder where it could be hidden.

1142
01:11:27,380 --> 01:11:29,190
I wonder where it could be hidden.

1143
01:11:29,610 --> 01:11:33,210
[Discovers a suspicious looking arrow sign
drawn onto the floor.]

1144
01:11:33,800 --> 01:11:37,070
[The arrow is leading to a door.]

1145
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:44,440
[Team Tiger's hints- Fifth floor; Gallery.
Team Delinquent's hint- World Cup.]

1146
01:11:46,220 --> 01:11:48,310
[He finds something!]

1147
01:11:48,310 --> 01:11:51,370
[The 'R' box!]

1148
01:11:51,380 --> 01:11:52,540
Hey!

1149
01:11:52,540 --> 01:11:54,690
- Gary!
- Hey!

1150
01:11:54,690 --> 01:11:56,620
Hey!
Gary!

1151
01:11:57,520 --> 01:11:59,630
- Gary!
- I can hear Jong Kook screaming.

1152
01:11:59,630 --> 01:12:01,890
[What did he discover?]

1153
01:12:01,890 --> 01:12:03,360
I can hear Jong Kook screaming.

1154
01:12:05,480 --> 01:12:07,720
[I have a bad feeling about this...]

1155
01:12:07,720 --> 01:12:08,990
- Gary!
- Yes, Jong Kook.

1156
01:12:08,990 --> 01:12:10,300
Hurry up and come here.

1157
01:12:10,300 --> 01:12:12,610
[Rushing off to Jong Kook's side.]

1158
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:16,740
[Everyone gathers around in front of
the room of mystery.]

1159
01:12:17,630 --> 01:12:19,010
The bag must be in there.

1160
01:12:20,170 --> 01:12:22,090
- That's Jong Kook's bag.
- What is that in there?

1161
01:12:22,090 --> 01:12:25,240
- Can you all back up?
- I need to talk to my teammates.

1162
01:12:26,280 --> 01:12:28,410
- We'll get back to you once we've talked.
- You've already found it?

1163
01:12:28,410 --> 01:12:30,350
We're going to stand out here
and watch.

1164
01:12:31,240 --> 01:12:33,250
See what's in there.

1165
01:12:36,760 --> 01:12:38,670
We have to know what's
in there too.

1166
01:12:39,640 --> 01:12:42,120
[Inside the 'R' marked chest...]

1167
01:12:42,120 --> 01:12:46,800
[A piece of paper that contains more
information on the legendary bag!]

1168
01:12:48,440 --> 01:12:51,980
See? That's why I told you that I think
we need to eliminate their name tags.

1169
01:12:52,540 --> 01:12:54,410
- Let's rip this up.
- So the others can't see.

1170
01:12:54,410 --> 01:12:57,740
[Secret agent Min Jung ripping
the paper to shreds.]

1171
01:12:57,740 --> 01:12:59,380
- Ming Jung!
- You're ripping it up?

1172
01:12:59,380 --> 01:13:00,590
[I'm grateful for what you're doing, but...]

1173
01:13:00,590 --> 01:13:02,260
Can't you let us see it first?

1174
01:13:02,260 --> 01:13:06,430
[Destroying the piece of papers so the other
delinquents can't see what's on it.]

1175
01:13:06,430 --> 01:13:08,130
- We're coming out.
- We're all coming out right now.

1176
01:13:08,570 --> 01:13:11,010
- Min Jung, tell us what you read.
- Let's get away from here for now.

1177
01:13:11,010 --> 01:13:13,030
[Min Jung keeping her secret.]

1178
01:13:14,730 --> 01:13:17,610
[The other students remain clueless.]

1179
01:13:17,610 --> 01:13:19,480
You just told me that they ripped up
whatever was in there, right?

1180
01:13:19,480 --> 01:13:21,360
- There was a piece of paper in here.
- Inside this box?

1181
01:13:21,880 --> 01:13:25,190
It said that there's a special mark
inside that bag.

1182
01:13:25,190 --> 01:13:27,600
So it means that the bag could be
one of ours.

1183
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:30,090
- Yes, you're right.
- Is the mark under our name tags?

1184
01:13:30,090 --> 01:13:33,170
- No, it said the mark is inside the bag.
- Inside the bag?

1185
01:13:33,180 --> 01:13:37,470
So we should all check our bags to see
what could be inside the bag.

1186
01:13:38,260 --> 01:13:41,310
So we should check and see if we can
find something inside our own bags.

1187
01:13:41,310 --> 01:13:43,280
[This man is clever...]

1188
01:13:43,280 --> 01:13:48,470
[Could Jong Kook be the other agent?]

1189
01:13:51,270 --> 01:13:54,870
[But I guess he always acts like
an undercover cop.]

1190
01:13:54,870 --> 01:13:56,740
- Min Jung, should we check yours first?
- What about me?

1191
01:13:56,740 --> 01:14:00,140
[Deciding to check Min Jung's bag first
with Gary on the lookout.]

1192
01:14:04,180 --> 01:14:07,980
Gary, stop searching your own bag and
keep your eye on the lookout.

1193
01:14:08,430 --> 01:14:11,120
- Don't look at your own bag right now.
- I'm just so curious.

1194
01:14:12,050 --> 01:14:14,350
[Mr. Gary unable to
sustain his own curiosity.]

1195
01:14:15,240 --> 01:14:16,700
I'm so curious.

1196
01:14:23,610 --> 01:14:25,810
[Unable to sustain his curiosity
and looks again in his bag.]

1197
01:14:26,360 --> 01:14:29,500
Why does he keep looking in his bag
even after we told him not to?

1198
01:14:29,500 --> 01:14:31,220
[If the other teams sees what he's doing,
they may figure out what's going on.]

1199
01:14:32,860 --> 01:14:34,390
It could be inside crevices like this.

1200
01:14:36,330 --> 01:14:38,430
Did you say that the mark was
inside the bag?

1201
01:14:38,950 --> 01:14:41,920
Don't say things like that
from over there!

1202
01:14:44,350 --> 01:14:46,300
Okay, I'll just sit here quietly.

1203
01:14:47,070 --> 01:14:51,180
[Detailed Jung Min and relaxed Gary
are total opposites.]

1204
01:14:51,180 --> 01:14:53,440
- You can't say things like that out loud.
- Okay.

1205
01:14:55,930 --> 01:15:02,860
[From what I can see...
Gary definitely is not the other agent.]

1206
01:15:04,670 --> 01:15:05,910
<i>Hello?</i>

1207
01:15:06,350 --> 01:15:07,550
<i>You want to meet?</i>

1208
01:15:10,530 --> 01:15:13,050
- Hurry up. What are you doing?
- Come here.

1209
01:15:13,630 --> 01:15:16,980
[Team Tiger calls
Kwang Ja out to them alone.]

1210
01:15:17,420 --> 01:15:20,220
- You're my opposing team.
- Okay, but come over here.

1211
01:15:20,220 --> 01:15:21,510
[Come here.]

1212
01:15:23,190 --> 01:15:24,840
Why are you grabbing my hand?

1213
01:15:26,540 --> 01:15:28,610
What is it that you guys know?

1214
01:15:28,610 --> 01:15:30,230
Do you know how this is
supposed to end today?

1215
01:15:30,230 --> 01:15:33,570
Do you know what we're supposed to do
for this mission today?

1216
01:15:33,720 --> 01:15:37,830
[Agent Kwang Ja pretending not to know
anything even though he's fully aware.]

1217
01:15:37,830 --> 01:15:40,220
No, I don't know. Why do you
keep asking me all these questions?

1218
01:15:40,220 --> 01:15:44,280
You don't know anything, right?
Then shouldn't you be working with us?

1219
01:15:44,280 --> 01:15:46,130
Because we know what's
going on here.

1220
01:15:46,140 --> 01:15:50,890
- Is the legendary book bag one of ours?
- No, it's not that.

1221
01:15:50,890 --> 01:15:52,930
We have to find the bag somewhere
from within this place.

1222
01:15:54,170 --> 01:15:55,960
You have to eliminate
Chun Jung Myung's name tag.

1223
01:15:55,960 --> 01:15:58,210
- If you do, we'll tell you everything.
- We'll tell you.

1224
01:15:58,210 --> 01:16:02,000
[Plans to use Kwang Ja to eliminate their
fiercest opponent, Jung Myung.]

1225
01:16:02,870 --> 01:16:05,670
[I know that I have to
eliminate him, but...]

1226
01:16:07,080 --> 01:16:09,150
Why do you keep cornering Kwang Soo?

1227
01:16:10,290 --> 01:16:13,250
[Just then, everyone else comes to
gather around where they're standing.]

1228
01:16:15,830 --> 01:16:17,230
- Jung Myung.
- Yes?

1229
01:16:17,230 --> 01:16:18,920
- Jung Myung. Why are you staring?
- Yes?

1230
01:16:19,360 --> 01:16:22,350
[Jung Myung isn't interested in anything else,
but to go head to head with Mr. Capable.]

1231
01:16:22,350 --> 01:16:24,680
[The real man wanting a real face-off.]

1232
01:16:24,680 --> 01:16:26,700
[You just wait.]

1233
01:16:27,850 --> 01:16:29,370
I heard there's a hint within the bags.

1234
01:16:29,370 --> 01:16:31,260
- I don't know what to do here.
- Why?

1235
01:16:31,260 --> 01:16:34,410
- You have to work with us.
- Is your bag the legendary bag?

1236
01:16:34,410 --> 01:16:36,970
[Ace Blank Ji with
her undoubtedly sharp eyes.]

1237
01:16:36,980 --> 01:16:39,180
I think our bags definitely
have to do with something.

1238
01:16:39,620 --> 01:16:42,100
So there is something inside our bags.

1239
01:16:42,390 --> 01:16:44,570
Maybe we'll find something
if we open our bags.

1240
01:16:44,570 --> 01:16:46,290
[Inside our bags?]

1241
01:16:46,290 --> 01:16:49,060
- I didn't see anything in there.
- Don't you remember the last time?

1242
01:16:49,740 --> 01:16:54,150
I think I may know.
Maybe we eliminate the name tags...

1243
01:16:54,860 --> 01:16:57,060
[Yes, I think I need to utilize this...]

1244
01:16:57,060 --> 01:16:58,520
I don't think it has anything
to do with the name tags

1245
01:16:58,520 --> 01:17:00,640
because I kept seeing the other
team members clutching onto their bags.

1246
01:17:02,030 --> 01:17:06,270
But what if they're faking it to divert us?

1247
01:17:06,270 --> 01:17:08,430
[In order to get these guys
to trust me...]

1248
01:17:08,430 --> 01:17:10,230
I think I know.
Min Jung already checked her name tag.

1249
01:17:10,230 --> 01:17:11,400
But nothing even happened.

1250
01:17:11,400 --> 01:17:12,770
- Really? She checked hers?
- Yes.

1251
01:17:12,770 --> 01:17:15,090
- But she didn't get ousted?
- I don't think it's the name tags.

1252
01:17:15,090 --> 01:17:17,760
[Just what is it that Kwang Ja
is planning?]

1253
01:17:17,760 --> 01:17:19,290
Want to try it?

1254
01:17:19,870 --> 01:17:23,550
She tried to steal my book bag,
so I ripped off her name tag.

1255
01:17:23,550 --> 01:17:26,430
- But what if this ousts him?
- I told you that nothing happened.

1256
01:17:26,430 --> 01:17:28,010
- You sure she didn't get ousted?
- Yes.

1257
01:17:28,410 --> 01:17:30,060
Okay, then I'll rip it off.

1258
01:17:30,060 --> 01:17:33,640
[Everyone pretending to be okay with the idea
and wanting to rip each other's tags off.]

1259
01:17:33,640 --> 01:17:35,410
- You told us she didn't get ousted.
- Are you sure that she didn't?

1260
01:17:35,410 --> 01:17:37,390
- Yes.
- Okay, then let's give it a try.

1261
01:17:37,390 --> 01:17:38,880
[His plan seems to be working.]

1262
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:42,150
Try it.
I don't think this will get us ousted.

1263
01:17:43,300 --> 01:17:44,960
- Wait.
- So this won't oust him?

1264
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:46,740
[Jae Suk's name tag is ripped off!]

1265
01:17:47,340 --> 01:17:48,520
Okay, stick it back on.

1266
01:17:48,890 --> 01:17:50,970
[It worked...]

1267
01:17:51,580 --> 01:17:54,770
<i>Yoo Jae Suk, out.
Yoo Jae Suk, out.</i>

1268
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,770
- Why am I ousted?
- I didn't think that would get you ousted.

1269
01:18:00,770 --> 01:18:05,900
<i>[Yoo Jae Suk's book bag will now go to
the person who ousted him.]</i>

1270
01:18:07,790 --> 01:18:10,770
[Doing everything within his power
to maintain his composure.]

1271
01:18:11,930 --> 01:18:15,460
- I guess you're right.
- We were just testing it out amongst us!

1272
01:18:15,460 --> 01:18:18,020
- But Min Jung didn't get ousted?
- I thought you ripped off Min Jung's name tag!

1273
01:18:18,020 --> 01:18:20,820
- Then why didn't Min Jung get ousted?
- Maybe you didn't rip it off all the way.

1274
01:18:20,820 --> 01:18:22,620
You did this on purpose, didn't you?

1275
01:18:22,620 --> 01:18:25,060
No, I didn't.
I don't know anything about the mission.

1276
01:18:25,550 --> 01:18:28,350
[Laughing out of
the absurdity of the situation.]

1277
01:18:28,350 --> 01:18:30,350
- I do feel a little bad.
- I'm sorry too.

1278
01:18:30,350 --> 01:18:32,360
<i>Don't do that from now on.</i>

1279
01:18:32,360 --> 01:18:34,960
[About to go out of his mind.]

1280
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:37,230
- We don't even know what the mission is.
- I have no idea what's going on here.

1281
01:18:37,560 --> 01:18:39,570
I'm sorry, but hand over your bag.

1282
01:18:39,570 --> 01:18:41,890
- Director...
- Give us your bag.

1283
01:18:41,890 --> 01:18:45,140
[The easiest elimination in
the history of Running Man.]

1284
01:18:47,120 --> 01:18:49,330
You guys can't do this.

1285
01:18:49,950 --> 01:18:53,090
[Kwang Soo's plan of ousting Jae Suk without
laying a finger on him is a huge success.]

1286
01:18:54,100 --> 01:18:56,940
[Still unable to believe
his current situation.]

1287
01:18:56,940 --> 01:19:00,850
I'm not the person that should be going
up to the jail right now.

1288
01:19:00,850 --> 01:19:03,120
I have a job to get done down there.

1289
01:19:03,120 --> 01:19:05,980
[Jae Suk- Out!]

1290
01:19:05,980 --> 01:19:08,740
- I can't believe that happened to Jae Suk.
- I do feel bad for him.

1291
01:19:08,740 --> 01:19:10,450
[Jae Suk's elimination still has them
reeling from the shock of it all.]

1292
01:19:10,450 --> 01:19:13,260
Jae Suk's elimination was such a surprise.

1293
01:19:13,260 --> 01:19:15,340
[Okay, I've eliminated Jae Suk.]

1294
01:19:16,570 --> 01:19:23,170
[But in order to get rid of him...]

1295
01:19:23,630 --> 01:19:25,730
I wonder whose bag is the
legendary bag?

1296
01:19:25,730 --> 01:19:29,640
[After three years of being on Running Man,
their abilities puts Sherlock Holmes to shame.]

1297
01:19:29,640 --> 01:19:31,320
I bet one of our bags is the legendary bag.

1298
01:19:31,320 --> 01:19:33,970
[How did they know that?]

1299
01:19:34,370 --> 01:19:39,180
[Everyone is starting to carefully
search through their bags.]

1300
01:19:39,180 --> 01:19:41,780
Hurry up and tell us what
you saw, Kwang Soo.

1301
01:19:41,780 --> 01:19:43,570
I didn't see anything.
I don't know anything either.

1302
01:19:43,570 --> 01:19:45,180
Then let's do this.

1303
01:19:45,180 --> 01:19:48,360
The other team needs someone
like Kwang Soo.

1304
01:19:49,770 --> 01:19:54,330
[All of them agreeing to send Kwang Ja in
to the other team to act as their spy.]

1305
01:19:54,730 --> 01:19:57,030
- I don't know what'll happen today.
- I'll be back.

1306
01:19:59,640 --> 01:20:03,900
[I need to start working
on the next step of my plan...]

1307
01:20:04,420 --> 01:20:09,970
The other team may get intimidated by
all of us acting like we know something.

1308
01:20:10,320 --> 01:20:12,380
It's better than not doing
anything, right?

1309
01:20:12,380 --> 01:20:14,210
Let's go there and act like we
know something.

1310
01:20:14,210 --> 01:20:17,620
- Ji Hyo, you lead, okay?
- Staying here isn't going to do us any good.

1311
01:20:17,650 --> 01:20:20,660
- I think we should go over and see them.
- They'll know I ousted Jae Suk.

1312
01:20:23,440 --> 01:20:25,840
That's why I don't think I'll be
able to eliminate Jung Myung.

1313
01:20:25,850 --> 01:20:28,330
- But what if...
- But I got Jae Suk ousted.

1314
01:20:28,330 --> 01:20:30,300
[Kwang Ja coming over and pretending
to join their forces.]

1315
01:20:30,300 --> 01:20:32,150
- There they are.
- They must be thinking the same thing we are.

1316
01:20:32,150 --> 01:20:36,120
[Everyone gathering up in one place.]

1317
01:20:36,120 --> 01:20:37,830
- I doubt you can know anything.
- You know something?

1318
01:20:37,830 --> 01:20:38,910
- You know anything?
- No, I don't.

1319
01:20:38,940 --> 01:20:42,440
Why don't we just simply
eliminate each other?

1320
01:20:42,910 --> 01:20:45,130
That's a nice and simple plan.
Let's just eliminate each other.

1321
01:20:45,260 --> 01:20:47,770
[Jung Myung finally wanting to start
eliminating each other's name tags.]

1322
01:20:47,770 --> 01:20:51,080
[He's starting to make his move.]

1323
01:20:52,300 --> 01:20:53,820
[This is dangerous.]

1324
01:20:54,630 --> 01:20:57,120
[Once that strong player starts to move,
that'll put me in danger too!]

1325
01:21:04,260 --> 01:21:09,980
[An outbreak of chaos could shed light
on the identity of the two undercover cops!]

1326
01:21:11,650 --> 01:21:14,570
[Jung Myung makes his move!]

1327
01:21:15,340 --> 01:21:17,250
[Min Jung is in danger!]

1328
01:21:17,600 --> 01:21:20,590
[Just then...]

1329
01:21:20,590 --> 01:21:23,620
[Secret agent Kwang Ja locks on
his target, Jung Myung!]

1330
01:21:23,780 --> 01:21:28,150
[While Mr. Capable is holding Jung Myung
tightly in his grasp...]

1331
01:21:29,920 --> 01:21:32,420
[Jung Myung's name tag!]

1332
01:21:33,830 --> 01:21:36,990
[Kwang Ja eliminates Jung Myung's
name tag!]

1333
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:42,300
[Jung Myung disappointingly gets ousted before
he can even get his hands on a name tag!]

1334
01:21:42,520 --> 01:21:44,010
[This is insane.]

1335
01:21:44,790 --> 01:21:47,230
[Fearful Kwang Ja makes her escape.]

1336
01:21:47,230 --> 01:21:49,600
Kwang Soo just eliminated Jung Myung.

1337
01:21:49,690 --> 01:21:53,910
[Chun Jung Myung... Out!]

1338
01:21:54,410 --> 01:21:56,820
[Okay, now...]

1339
01:21:56,820 --> 01:22:00,750
[If I can just eliminate
Mr. Capable and Gary...]

1340
01:22:01,730 --> 01:22:04,840
[There are so many people to eliminate...]

1341
01:22:07,060 --> 01:22:11,740
[Which one of these two secret agents
will succeed in their plans?]

1342
01:22:12,530 --> 01:22:15,170
[Jong Kook is doing whatever he can
to protect Min Jung.]

1343
01:22:21,030 --> 01:22:24,340
[Ace Ji Hyo springs a surprise attack
on Ha Ha to eliminate him.]

1344
01:22:25,950 --> 01:22:28,630
[Ji Hyo starting to eliminate others
in order to gain the victory for herself.]

1345
01:22:28,640 --> 01:22:30,500
[What luck is this!]

1346
01:22:30,500 --> 01:22:34,580
Did you think that you'd be safe after
eliminating one of my team members?

1347
01:22:35,030 --> 01:22:38,920
[This is starting to look pretty good
for the two secret agents.]

1348
01:22:39,640 --> 01:22:41,270
Wow, Song Ji Hyo.

1349
01:22:41,270 --> 01:22:42,430
[Ha Ha- Out!]

1350
01:22:42,450 --> 01:22:46,970
[No marks indicating that Ha Ha could be
a secret agent under his name tag.]

1351
01:22:46,970 --> 01:22:49,590
[Okay, it definitely wasn't Ha Ha.]

1352
01:22:56,970 --> 01:22:59,730
[Ji Hyo eliminates Gary's name tag!]

1353
01:23:02,200 --> 01:23:07,290
[Could it be?
But it wasn't Gary either.]

1354
01:23:10,840 --> 01:23:13,310
Song!
Song Ji Hyo!

1355
01:23:13,310 --> 01:23:15,050
Song Ji Hyo!

1356
01:23:16,300 --> 01:23:17,620
You're on fire!

1357
01:23:17,620 --> 01:23:19,070
It's me.

1358
01:23:19,920 --> 01:23:23,270
[Oh no... Mr. Gary's feelings are hurt.]

1359
01:23:25,290 --> 01:23:27,810
[Gary- Out!]

1360
01:23:28,740 --> 01:23:31,690
[Now there are five remaining survivors.]

1361
01:23:31,690 --> 01:23:34,190
- Come on.
- Come over here. We won't touch you.

1362
01:23:34,190 --> 01:23:35,980
- I don't trust you.
- Why don't you trust me?

1363
01:23:35,980 --> 01:23:37,750
- No, I don't trust you.
- Come here.

1364
01:23:37,750 --> 01:23:39,620
[Ace Ji Hyo seemingly having a good chance
at gaining the victory for herself.]

1365
01:23:40,490 --> 01:23:43,890
[Let me think about this for a moment...]

1366
01:23:45,490 --> 01:23:52,430
[Her eagerness to eliminate others...
She really is Ace Ji Hyo!]

1367
01:23:53,480 --> 01:23:55,660
[If I just leave her be,
that'll put me in danger too!]

1368
01:23:55,670 --> 01:23:58,490
[And my own protector, Jong Kook
could be put in danger too!]

1369
01:23:58,490 --> 01:24:01,810
[I'm sorry, Ji Hyo.]

1370
01:24:03,530 --> 01:24:06,550
[Min Jung inching her way
behind Ji Hyo's back.]

1371
01:24:11,080 --> 01:24:13,210
[Min Jung eliminates Ji Hyo's name tag.]

1372
01:24:13,210 --> 01:24:15,620
I'm so sorry, Ji Hyo.
I'm sorry, Ji Hyo!

1373
01:24:17,490 --> 01:24:18,840
Why did you do that, Min Jung?

1374
01:24:18,840 --> 01:24:20,570
[What is this stroke of luck?]

1375
01:24:20,570 --> 01:24:22,340
I'm sorry, Ji Hyo.
I have my own reasons!

1376
01:24:22,340 --> 01:24:23,790
- I'm sorry.
- Come here.

1377
01:24:24,630 --> 01:24:26,720
She's the epitome of a traitor.

1378
01:24:27,800 --> 01:24:30,330
[This is it.
The legendary book bag will be mine!]

1379
01:24:31,530 --> 01:24:33,750
[The secret document inside the
legendary book bag will be mine!]

1380
01:24:35,420 --> 01:24:37,620
[This is the final battle!]

1381
01:24:38,830 --> 01:24:41,460
[Jong Kook remains oblivious to everything
and continues to protect Min Jung.]

1382
01:24:45,770 --> 01:24:47,740
[Jong Kook has Kwang Soo in
his tight grasp!]

1383
01:24:47,740 --> 01:24:50,090
[Min Jung falls back into danger!]

1384
01:24:51,390 --> 01:24:55,050
[Just who will take possession
of the legendary book bag?]

1385
01:24:58,540 --> 01:25:00,490
[Jong Kook attacks Kwang Ja!]

1386
01:25:01,640 --> 01:25:03,320
<i>I will be the best cop that I can be!</i>

1387
01:25:03,320 --> 01:25:05,160
<i>I will return upon the success
of my mission.</i>

1388
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:09,500
[I will...]

1389
01:25:10,590 --> 01:25:12,100
<i>I will return upon the success
of my mission.</i>

1390
01:25:17,480 --> 01:25:20,010
[By the split of a hair,
Kwang Ja's name tag is eliminated.]

1391
01:25:21,780 --> 01:25:24,280
[Ah... I was so close...]

1392
01:25:24,280 --> 01:25:26,820
[Agent Lee Kwang Ja fails
her mission.]

1393
01:25:30,790 --> 01:25:32,830
What is that?
What is that 'undercover cop' mark?

1394
01:25:32,830 --> 01:25:34,430
- You were an undercover cop?
- Wait a minute.

1395
01:25:34,430 --> 01:25:36,340
- You were an undercover cop?
- What?

1396
01:25:38,350 --> 01:25:40,720
[Undercover cop...]

1397
01:25:40,720 --> 01:25:43,740
[Kwang Ja, it was you?]

1398
01:25:48,460 --> 01:25:52,490
[I had no idea...]

1399
01:25:52,490 --> 01:25:56,730
[And I tormented you all day...]

1400
01:25:56,730 --> 01:26:01,110
[What have we done to each other today
as fellow undercover cops?]

1401
01:26:03,380 --> 01:26:09,810
[Kwang Ja... I hadn't
even fathomed that you'd be...]

1402
01:26:10,940 --> 01:26:13,970
- You were an undercover cop?
- No!

1403
01:26:15,740 --> 01:26:18,860
[Kwang Ja fails her undercover mission.]

1404
01:26:19,300 --> 01:26:22,390
[Oh no...]

1405
01:26:22,390 --> 01:26:26,470
[I'm sorry, Kwang Ja.]

1406
01:26:26,470 --> 01:26:30,800
[I'll complete the mission
for the both of us.]

1407
01:26:31,980 --> 01:26:33,770
[Immediately turns their attention
onto Big-nosed Brother.]

1408
01:26:33,770 --> 01:26:36,150
[Easily eliminates him
with the help of Jong Kook.]

1409
01:26:37,080 --> 01:26:39,910
[Acting like they won the mission.]

1410
01:26:39,910 --> 01:26:41,610
What was that about the undercover cop?

1411
01:26:43,010 --> 01:26:45,800
[Undercover cop?
This is it.]

1412
01:26:45,800 --> 01:26:48,280
[Undercover cop, Min Jung
Eliminates Jong Kook's name tag!]

1413
01:26:48,280 --> 01:26:51,480
[Succeeds in eliminates every one
of the delinquents.]

1414
01:26:51,480 --> 01:26:54,030
[I did it!]

1415
01:26:55,250 --> 01:26:57,970
- Min Jung?
- Why is she an undercover agent?

1416
01:26:58,820 --> 01:27:00,610
You didn't know that either?

1417
01:27:00,610 --> 01:27:03,700
Why are you an undercover cop,
Kwang Soo?

1418
01:27:04,310 --> 01:27:07,980
[The two undercover cops' mission was
to eliminate all the other members.]

1419
01:27:07,980 --> 01:27:09,960
I barely stopped myself from
eliminating you first.

1420
01:27:13,170 --> 01:27:17,120
[Which one of these bags
is the legendary bag?]

1421
01:27:17,120 --> 01:27:20,650
[The secret document is said to be
inside that bag.]

1422
01:27:26,600 --> 01:27:28,140
[Oh?]

1423
01:27:28,140 --> 01:27:30,430
[Discovers the mark!]

1424
01:27:31,270 --> 01:27:34,980
[This bag had originally belonged
to Jae Suk from the beginning...]

1425
01:27:36,710 --> 01:27:40,710
[There's something in there!]

1426
01:27:43,630 --> 01:27:45,920
[Discovers the top secret document!]

1427
01:27:45,920 --> 01:27:47,300
I found it.

1428
01:27:48,210 --> 01:27:49,640

You have to wait for me.</i>

1435
01:28:14,790 --> 01:28:16,760
<i>- Don't let him fool you.
- He's deceiving you.</i>

1436
01:28:16,760 --> 01:28:18,200
