00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,067
[The real battle will unfold.]

00:00:10,515 --> 00:00:13,450
[Passing the borders of
the variety world into reality.]

3
00:00:14,632 --> 00:00:17,425
[Only one victor can walk out
of the battle ring.]

00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:22,286
[Wangsimi Station]

6
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:28,518
I love Wangsimi!

7
00:00:29,009 --> 00:00:30,298
I'm tired!

8
00:00:30,815 --> 00:00:32,644
What is all this back here?

9
00:00:32,645 --> 00:00:34,425
Are we voting for something?

10
00:00:34,425 --> 00:00:37,825
<i>I know that you all must be very tired
from having ran for the past 168 episodes.</i>

11
00:00:37,826 --> 00:00:40,858
<i>So we have prepared the opening in front
of the famed 'Road of Longevity'.</i>

12
00:00:40,859 --> 00:00:42,910
- Ah, this is what it is?
- That's the road?

13
00:00:42,911 --> 00:00:46,721
[A place reputed to be good for your health
due to the phytoncides.]

14
00:00:47,254 --> 00:00:51,286
This guy might live a long life, but the
people around him have a short life span.

15
00:00:51,649 --> 00:00:55,017
He doesn't know that about himself.
He stresses out the people around him.

16
00:00:55,422 --> 00:00:59,387
- What are we doing today?
- You will be having guests on the show today.

17
00:00:59,388 --> 00:01:02,371
- I think I know who it is.
- One person's been talking about it for days.

18
00:01:02,612 --> 00:01:05,650
[One person... is probably
someone they're familiar with?]

19
00:01:07,036 --> 00:01:08,754
- Hello.
- Hello.

20
00:01:09,236 --> 00:01:12,156
[A debonair elder who keeps on walking
with his eyes fixed straight ahead.]

21
00:01:12,157 --> 00:01:14,676
- No, he's not our guest.
- But he was so cool!

22
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,707
<i>Your guests for the day are...</i>

23
00:01:16,708 --> 00:01:20,512
<i>two people who we wish will have a
very long career in the music field.</i>

24
00:01:20,513 --> 00:01:22,292
- They're musicians?
- Yes.

25
00:01:22,292 --> 00:01:25,191
<i>Let's invite the first musician out here.</i>

26
00:01:26,438 --> 00:01:28,570
[The first musician makes her appearance.]

27
00:01:37,492 --> 00:01:38,590
It's a girl.

28
00:01:39,178 --> 00:01:41,265
We can tell that it's an Idol.

29
00:01:41,266 --> 00:01:44,100
- Be careful of the steps.
- She looks somewhat familiar to me.

30
00:01:44,101 --> 00:01:48,031
[Taking cute little steps towards them holding
a fan with the picture of a lamb on it.]

31
00:01:48,393 --> 00:01:49,963
Who is it?

32
00:01:54,995 --> 00:01:58,270
['I'm now a young woman', IU.]

33
00:02:00,549 --> 00:02:03,039
- IU!
- Yes!

34
00:02:05,028 --> 00:02:07,099
[Garnering the attention from
all the male students.]

35
00:02:08,929 --> 00:02:11,790
- Her hair color threw me off.
- Yes, I dyed my hair.

36
00:02:11,791 --> 00:02:14,338
- You look amazing with that hair color.
- You look like a grown up woman now.

37
00:02:14,339 --> 00:02:17,201
- You've gotten so much prettier.
- What do you mean? She's always been pretty.

38
00:02:17,202 --> 00:02:19,667
Why are you looking at IU
as a woman?

39
00:02:19,918 --> 00:02:21,622
She is a woman.

40
00:02:23,051 --> 00:02:24,430
There you go again!

41
00:02:24,431 --> 00:02:29,318
I've always thought of her as a kid sister,
but she looks more like a woman now.

42
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:31,465
- She's grown up a lot.
- She used to look like a pretty kid.

43
00:02:31,466 --> 00:02:33,617
I know what you mean.
Even the last time when we played soccer.

44
00:02:33,618 --> 00:02:37,738
- Even the way she's behaving now.
- She never used to do things like that.

45
00:02:44,699 --> 00:02:47,069
She's really hamming it up
for the camera right now.

46
00:02:47,069 --> 00:02:49,247
Her hair wasn't even falling on her face,
but she keeps pushing it back.

47
00:02:49,248 --> 00:02:51,700
- Why isn't the other guest here yet?
- Who is it?

48
00:02:51,701 --> 00:02:54,568
He says he's the face of SBS
with his appearances on all the shows.

49
00:02:54,569 --> 00:02:55,868
Who is it?

50
00:03:00,892 --> 00:03:03,310
[Hiding his face behind the fan
with the picture of the wolf on it.]

51
00:03:03,311 --> 00:03:06,621
[A musician hidden behind a
cloud of mystery.]

52
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:11,811
- You were right.
- Can't you just tell by his walk?

53
00:03:11,812 --> 00:03:14,147
I saw the back of his head.
I think I know who it is.

54
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,596
[A very unique hairstyle from the back.]

55
00:03:18,296 --> 00:03:20,944
[Even the crowd may be able to
recognize him from the briefest glance.]

56
00:03:21,258 --> 00:03:23,732
[Along with his cup of morning coffee.]

57
00:03:25,096 --> 00:03:26,497
Why is he acting like that?

58
00:03:27,412 --> 00:03:32,755
Let's just have IU be our only guest today.
I see him three days out of the week.

59
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:38,155
I knew it was going to be him.

60
00:03:41,042 --> 00:03:42,889
Just go back up the stairs.

61
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:45,206
Why are you here?
Why did you come on the show?

62
00:03:46,367 --> 00:03:48,074
Why would you come on our show?

63
00:03:48,075 --> 00:03:50,295
[Not the most welcomed guest
on the show.]

64
00:03:52,659 --> 00:03:54,288
This is a good opportunity for you guys.

65
00:03:54,289 --> 00:03:55,726
What are you talking about?

66
00:03:56,953 --> 00:03:59,142
'Ha-Myung-Kook'...
Wow, it's been a really long time.

67
00:03:59,143 --> 00:04:01,558
['Ha-Myung-Kook' together again
for the first time in a long time.]

68
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:06,543
[The trio that used to bring the audience
a lot of laughter during the 'X-Man' days.]

69
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:08,133
So you remember.

70
00:04:08,133 --> 00:04:09,917
[Just like the way they used to dance
back in those days.]

71
00:04:09,918 --> 00:04:11,838
- I remember now!
- It really has been a long time.

72
00:04:12,403 --> 00:04:14,327
Why do you have guys like
these on the show?

73
00:04:14,328 --> 00:04:16,145
What are you talking about?

74
00:04:17,836 --> 00:04:21,195
[Morning threats that go hand in hand
with his morning coffee.]

75
00:04:21,196 --> 00:04:23,165
<i>First of all,
this will be an individual race today.</i>

76
00:04:23,166 --> 00:04:24,591
- Really?
- Individual?

77
00:04:24,947 --> 00:04:27,654
<i>- You will all be competing on your own.
- Okay.</i>

78
00:04:27,655 --> 00:04:31,318
<i>But, before you get
to the final individual round</i>

79
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:33,325
<i>you will be competing in teams
during the course of the day.</i>

80
00:04:33,644 --> 00:04:35,642
<i>- I'll now announce your teams.
- Okay.</i>

81
00:04:35,643 --> 00:04:39,300
<i>For old times' sake,
the first team will be, 'Ha-Myung-Kook'.</i>

82
00:04:39,301 --> 00:04:40,991
- Wow!
- Seriously?

83
00:04:41,654 --> 00:04:43,603
'Ha-Myung-Kook' is back together again?

84
00:04:47,642 --> 00:04:49,748
'Ha-Myung-Kook'
is really going to be a team?

85
00:04:49,932 --> 00:04:52,112
This could be an opportunity for us.
There's no need for us to be worried.

86
00:04:52,113 --> 00:04:54,414
- We're all set now.
- Get over here!

87
00:04:54,415 --> 00:04:58,162
I'm going to tell you this right now...
but you're dead today.

88
00:04:58,536 --> 00:05:01,413
Yoo Jae Suk, Lee Kwang Soo,
and IU will be a team.

89
00:05:02,458 --> 00:05:04,387
I'm stuck between the Monday Couple.

90
00:05:04,654 --> 00:05:07,931
[And lastly, Suk Jin, Gary
and Ji Hyo make up the final team.]

91
00:05:07,932 --> 00:05:10,188
- This makes me uncomfortable.
- You're with the Monday Couple.

92
00:05:10,189 --> 00:05:12,992
- This is the best case scenario ever.
- I'm stuck between these two lovebirds.

93
00:05:12,993 --> 00:05:15,268
<i>Today's race is titled,
The Wolf and the Lamb Race.</i>

94
00:05:15,269 --> 00:05:17,320
<i>As for the details of this race</i>

95
00:05:17,321 --> 00:05:21,921
<i>we will tell you what the details are once
you step into the enclosed booths behind you.</i>

96
00:05:23,278 --> 00:05:24,302
What is this?

97
00:05:26,955 --> 00:05:28,463
Name, wolf and lamb?

98
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:33,595
[Inside the voting booth is a voting card,
and two pictured cards?]

99
00:05:33,963 --> 00:05:40,407
<i>First, please pick one of the cards
between the wolf and the lamb card.</i>

100
00:05:40,408 --> 00:05:42,572
[Choose a card between
the lamb and the wolf card?]

101
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:48,169
[Doesn't seem to be an easy choice to make...]

102
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:50,387
<i>Please choose a card between
the two pictured cards in front of you.</i>

103
00:05:53,856 --> 00:05:55,703
I have chosen my card.

104
00:05:57,335 --> 00:06:02,137
[Everyone chooses a card.]

105
00:06:03,514 --> 00:06:06,442
For some reason, I have a feeling that
everyone's going to pick the wolf card.

106
00:06:06,443 --> 00:06:09,739
Because the wolf is stronger,
and I think that would mean, attack.

107
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:11,040
[The wolf card means 'attack'?]

108
00:06:11,075 --> 00:06:13,794
And unbelievably enough,
my astrological sign is the lamb.

109
00:06:14,097 --> 00:06:15,943
This card has the lamb on it.

110
00:06:15,944 --> 00:06:18,190
I think this is fate.

111
00:06:18,191 --> 00:06:20,809
I feel like this selection
is a very important one.

112
00:06:21,531 --> 00:06:25,476
Isn't the wolf the predator...
and the lamb, the prey?

113
00:06:25,477 --> 00:06:29,063
If that's the case,
I'd feel better going with the wolf.

114
00:06:30,134 --> 00:06:32,687
But I'm pretty sure that everyone
is going to pick the wolf.

115
00:06:33,442 --> 00:06:34,600
The lamb.

116
00:06:34,601 --> 00:06:36,198
[In the end, he chooses the lamb.]

117
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:38,065
<i>Please put the card you have
chosen inside your pouch.</i>

118
00:06:40,268 --> 00:06:42,190
I have a feeling that everyone
is going to choose the lamb.

119
00:06:42,878 --> 00:06:45,787
[Big-nose Brother's
new conceptual thinking...]

120
00:06:47,522 --> 00:06:49,106
[Blank Ji chooses the lamb.]

121
00:06:49,107 --> 00:06:51,847
Aren't the wolves a breed of dogs?

122
00:06:51,969 --> 00:06:55,742
<i>Now... we will start the betting.</i>

123
00:06:56,445 --> 00:07:00,754
[Betting?]

124
00:07:00,755 --> 00:07:04,160
<i>- We will now start the betting.
- Betting?</i>

125
00:07:04,161 --> 00:07:08,874
<i>You will choose a card between
the wolf and the lamb card.</i>

126
00:07:09,261 --> 00:07:14,532
<i>Today's race will be about correctly guessing
which card the others have chosen.</i>

127
00:07:14,695 --> 00:07:17,519
[A total of nine players.]

128
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:23,122
[Deduce the probability of the number
of lambs against the number of wolves.]

129
00:07:23,123 --> 00:07:27,574
[For those who guess wrong...
a terrifying fate awaits them.]

130
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:31,751
<i>Out of nine total players
which includes yourself</i>

131
00:07:31,752 --> 00:07:34,835
<i>you must guess how many of
the players have chosen the wolf card</i>

132
00:07:34,836 --> 00:07:38,104
<i>and guess how many of the players
have chosen the lamb card</i>

133
00:07:38,105 --> 00:07:41,251
<i>and write down your guess on
the voting ticket that is provided.</i>

134
00:07:43,669 --> 00:07:46,335
[Their deduction is now complete.]

135
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:52,618
<i>We will now be starting the race.</i>

136
00:07:52,619 --> 00:07:59,236
<i>But the team that comes in at first place
will have the chance to change their guess.</i>

137
00:08:00,331 --> 00:08:02,954
I have no idea what he's saying right now.
This is driving me crazy.

138
00:08:04,176 --> 00:08:10,486
[The team that comes in first can change their
guess to help increase their chance at a win.]

139
00:08:10,487 --> 00:08:14,056
<i>Since the lamb and the wolf count can
change throughout the course of the race</i>

140
00:08:14,057 --> 00:08:18,705
<i>you have to do whatever you can to find out
which card the others have chosen.</i>

141
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:23,170
<i>You have to do your best to get your guess
to match the actual number of people.</i>

142
00:08:23,171 --> 00:08:26,992
<i>The most important thing to remember is
that this is ultimately an individual race.</i>

143
00:08:26,992 --> 00:08:29,393
If this is an individual race,
then does the sole winner win anything?

144
00:08:29,393 --> 00:08:31,112
- Yes, of course.
- The winner usually gets gold.

145
00:08:31,113 --> 00:08:33,570
- In the event of there being a sole winner...
- What will the winner get?

146
00:08:33,571 --> 00:08:35,043
- What is it?
- Can you tell us?

147
00:08:35,412 --> 00:08:36,923
It's gold!

148
00:08:36,924 --> 00:08:39,571
- If it's gold, then Ji Hyo usually wins it.
- The winner gets all that?

149
00:08:39,897 --> 00:08:41,875
- All of that?
- All that gold?

150
00:08:42,332 --> 00:08:44,804
- I really want to win that.
- The winner gets all that gold?

151
00:08:44,877 --> 00:08:48,846
[Even the sweet and innocent IU
is riveted by the sight of all the gold.]

152
00:08:48,847 --> 00:08:50,456
- Hey.
- IU...

153
00:08:51,638 --> 00:08:54,156
- That's just a lot of gold.
- IU really has grown up.

154
00:08:54,156 --> 00:08:55,682
I'm actually more afraid of Ji Hyo.

155
00:08:55,683 --> 00:08:57,614
Ji Hyo already thinks that
the gold is hers.

156
00:08:57,615 --> 00:08:59,657
['Gold Ji Hyo' looking at ease.]

157
00:08:59,658 --> 00:09:03,286
So the person who guessed correctly
will take the gold.

158
00:09:03,287 --> 00:09:06,333
If only one person guesses correctly,
then that person will take all the gold.

159
00:09:09,177 --> 00:09:11,318
Why are you smiling so widely all of a sudden
after seeing all that gold?

160
00:09:11,319 --> 00:09:13,996
- Why are you so happy about it?
- Are you telling me that you don't like it?

161
00:09:13,997 --> 00:09:15,914
- You don't like it?
- Your face changed so suddenly.

162
00:09:15,915 --> 00:09:19,007
I heard what you just said about IU,
and I've never seen her smile so big before.

163
00:09:19,008 --> 00:09:22,017
It means that IU's all grown up now,
and she's going to go after that gold.

164
00:09:22,742 --> 00:09:26,306
<i>We will now start
the Wolf and the Lamb Race.</i>

165
00:09:26,307 --> 00:09:28,148
- Let's all get on the road now.
- Let's go!

166
00:09:28,149 --> 00:09:31,477
[Wolf and the Lamb Race- Start!]

167
00:09:34,629 --> 00:09:36,655
I'm so happy be to teamed up with IU.

168
00:09:36,656 --> 00:09:39,283
Do you know how nervous I was
that I might get teamed up with Myung Soo?

169
00:09:39,284 --> 00:09:41,374
And it's also nice to have
Kwang Soo on our team.

170
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:44,602
We need Kwang Soo around because
he makes a very good errand boy.

171
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:47,135
Why would I be your errand boy?

172
00:09:47,482 --> 00:09:50,714
Of course, you'd have to.
You expect IU to be the errand girl?

173
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:53,145
If we're going to go by age,
wouldn't IU be the youngest here?

174
00:09:53,146 --> 00:09:56,144
Even though IU may be the youngest,
she's still IU.

175
00:09:56,285 --> 00:09:59,843
- I.U. I miss you!
- What is that?

176
00:09:59,844 --> 00:10:02,230
He's 'Lee', and I'm 'Yoo'.
So that's why we say that.

177
00:10:02,728 --> 00:10:06,053
When UEE was on the show,
we'd say, 'U-EE, I miss you!'

178
00:10:06,054 --> 00:10:07,973
[Depending on the situation, they'd
switch around the order of the words.]

179
00:10:08,272 --> 00:10:11,922
Jae Suk, don't you and Kwang Soo
usually like Uee the most?

180
00:10:11,923 --> 00:10:16,448
- Jong Kook, we said we missed IU.
- It's all about IU today.

181
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:19,336
I want to ride in the same car with IU.

182
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:22,350
Where are you taking your father?

183
00:10:22,351 --> 00:10:25,085
- We're taking him for a nice drive.
- I just got a text.

184
00:10:25,294 --> 00:10:28,105
<i>[One of you nine people has
the correct guess.]</i>

185
00:10:28,106 --> 00:10:30,497
- I guess one of us must be right.
- Really?

186
00:10:30,498 --> 00:10:32,925
[One of the nine players
has the correct guess.]

187
00:10:32,926 --> 00:10:33,985
There is.

188
00:10:33,986 --> 00:10:36,088
So one of us has the right guess?

189
00:10:36,089 --> 00:10:39,146
[What could be the correct number of
wolves vs. lambs?]

190
00:10:39,147 --> 00:10:41,508
- One of us has the correct guess.
- Really?

191
00:10:44,453 --> 00:10:48,374
[Current count]

192
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:50,249
[Thus...]

193
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:53,180
[The current players with the correct guess
is the Monday Couple.]

194
00:10:53,181 --> 00:10:55,840
- Go to the War Memorabilia Center.
- Okay, let's go!

195
00:10:55,841 --> 00:10:57,227
Party time!

196
00:10:58,163 --> 00:10:59,639
Which card did you pick?

197
00:11:00,845 --> 00:11:03,779
- Yeah, why don't you tell us?
- Can't we tell each other right now?

198
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:05,748
We can change our guess
as long as we come in at first place.

199
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:07,411
- Yes, that sounds good.
- You're right.

200
00:11:07,784 --> 00:11:10,109
- Then let's just tell each other right now.
- Okay.

201
00:11:10,457 --> 00:11:11,757
Okay, seriously?

202
00:11:11,758 --> 00:11:14,349
- I chose the wolf card.
- But we may not come in at first place.

203
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:16,758
- Yes, you're right.
- You can't do that!

204
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,308
[Not telling which card
they've chosen themselves.]

205
00:11:20,309 --> 00:11:23,152
Why would I say anything before
you'd tell us what you've chosen?

206
00:11:23,153 --> 00:11:25,641
And also, to be perfectly honest...

207
00:11:25,642 --> 00:11:29,164
even though you told us you picked the wolf,
there's no way for me to know that for sure.

208
00:11:29,451 --> 00:11:31,371
- Aren't I right, IU?
- Yes, you're right.

209
00:11:31,372 --> 00:11:33,121
You lied to us just now, didn't you?

210
00:11:33,122 --> 00:11:35,034
I really did pick the wolf, Jae Suk.

211
00:11:36,179 --> 00:11:38,650
[Say what? Did you
just say that you picked the wolf?]

212
00:11:38,651 --> 00:11:42,701
[Lying and betrayal has become a part
of this traitorous Giraffe's DNA.]

213
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:45,331
- I really do think he picked the wolf.
- You do?

214
00:11:45,332 --> 00:11:48,067
The reason being, the wolf...

215
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:51,665
When it comes to a wolf and a lamb,
a wolf made me think of being on the chase.

216
00:11:51,666 --> 00:11:53,736
[Once IU voiced her opinion, Giraffe
immediately goes into reasoning mode.]

217
00:11:53,737 --> 00:11:57,429
- That's why I chose it.
- I do think that most picked the wolf.

218
00:11:57,430 --> 00:12:00,799
It's because I know how stressful it can be
to be the one being chased.

219
00:12:01,458 --> 00:12:03,348
Did you pick the wolf too, IU?

220
00:12:04,338 --> 00:12:07,064
[Gazing up instead of answering
his question?]

221
00:12:07,065 --> 00:12:09,272
Why are you staring up here?

222
00:12:09,273 --> 00:12:11,644
[Suspicious behavior as if she's
just been caught doing something.]

223
00:12:14,445 --> 00:12:16,456
What about you?
You picked the lamb, didn't you?

224
00:12:17,954 --> 00:12:21,459
- Let's just show each other our cards.
- I chose the wolf.

225
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:22,737
- You did?
- Really?

226
00:12:22,738 --> 00:12:23,889
Yeah, I picked the wolf.

227
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:26,156
[Because he thinks the wolf is like a dog,
that's why he chose the wolf?]

228
00:12:26,157 --> 00:12:28,062
- I chose the lamb.
- You chose the lamb?

229
00:12:28,063 --> 00:12:30,785
[Ji Hyo shares what she chose
with her teammates.]

230
00:12:30,786 --> 00:12:35,051
Why don't we just win this thing?
Just any one of our own team members.

231
00:12:35,052 --> 00:12:36,928
Let's just work together as a team.

232
00:12:36,929 --> 00:12:39,530
Since there are nine gold bars,
we can just split the winnings.

233
00:12:39,531 --> 00:12:41,717
[Their plan is to split the prize
if any one of them wins?]

234
00:12:41,718 --> 00:12:45,554
Don't do anything like giving your prize to
Myung Soo or IU because they're guests.

235
00:12:45,555 --> 00:12:48,313
- No, let's just split it amongst us.
- Yeah, keep it amongst ourselves.

236
00:12:48,615 --> 00:12:52,147
I had a feeling that you'd choose wolf,
so I put you in the wolf column.

237
00:12:53,832 --> 00:12:56,236
[Will it be the team that suspects each other
or the team that will work together?]

238
00:12:56,236 --> 00:12:59,410
Myung Soo is amazing at Acrostic poems.

239
00:13:00,666 --> 00:13:03,645
Seriously, Jong Kook.
He is a genius with those poems.

240
00:13:04,071 --> 00:13:06,626
Park Myung Soo.
His first appearance on SBS weekend program.

241
00:13:07,126 --> 00:13:09,648
2013's Grand Award.

242
00:13:09,649 --> 00:13:12,261
No, I don't want any awards.
I'll only get cussed out for winning.

243
00:13:12,837 --> 00:13:16,435
- Run! ('Run' sounds like 'Lun')
- I did some lunges.

244
00:13:18,031 --> 00:13:24,384
The lunges were so hard on my body,
so I opened the fridge to get a drink.

245
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:30,938
- All the viewers together, 'Ning!'
- And it made my stomach so queasy.

246
00:13:32,844 --> 00:13:37,119
I wasn't sure if it was sesame oil,
or perilla oil that I drank.

247
00:13:38,085 --> 00:13:39,593
- Man!
- Man.

248
00:13:42,623 --> 00:13:45,139
We will be back after this brief break.

249
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:46,821
Just what are the other teams doing?

250
00:13:46,822 --> 00:13:50,385
['Ha-Myung-Kook' trio in perfect sync,
and harmony with their words.]

251
00:13:52,877 --> 00:13:56,094
- My house is right over there.
- That's right, your house is right there.

252
00:13:56,573 --> 00:13:58,669
Then why don't you just
call it a day and go home?

253
00:13:58,669 --> 00:14:00,355
Thanks for all your work today.

254
00:14:00,503 --> 00:14:01,608
IU.

255
00:14:01,609 --> 00:14:03,872
[Giraffe's feelings are hurt.]

256
00:14:03,873 --> 00:14:06,821
Why do you keep repeating IU's name?
What she said isn't wrong.

257
00:14:06,822 --> 00:14:09,025
- Why do you mean, go home?
- This is what you call working in sync.

258
00:14:09,026 --> 00:14:11,168
[Siblings 'Yoo-U' in perfect sync.]

259
00:14:11,169 --> 00:14:14,064
Are you two just going to work in sync
by yourselves without me?

260
00:14:14,512 --> 00:14:17,261
['Ha-Myung-Kook' is back at it
with the acrostic poems.]

261
00:14:17,262 --> 00:14:20,071
- Okay, one last time.
- I need everyone's attention, please.

262
00:14:20,258 --> 00:14:22,316
- Run!
- After I did some lunges...

263
00:14:22,317 --> 00:14:24,799
I took a hot shower, and when I was done,
I noticed that it was 7am.

264
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,693
As I saw the people passing by on the street,
I shouted out to them, 'Good mor...'

265
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:31,594
What? 'Good Mor?'
Could it be what I'm thinking?

266
00:14:31,961 --> 00:14:35,440
Say it with us, viewing audience.
'Ning'!

267
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:38,488
'Ning'... that's how I greeted everyone.

268
00:14:38,489 --> 00:14:42,082
And once I greeted everyone,
they all told me how polite I was.

269
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:45,911
And do you know what they said to me?
'Mother, father, gentle?'

270
00:14:46,973 --> 00:14:49,299
[Oh my goodness.]

271
00:14:50,673 --> 00:14:53,967
[Just like his reputation that precedes him,
he really is a whiz at acrostic poems...]

272
00:14:54,361 --> 00:14:56,639
Dear viewing audience,
please give him a round of applause.

273
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,578
Everyone shout it out with us
one last time.

274
00:14:58,579 --> 00:15:00,453
Man!

275
00:15:00,728 --> 00:15:02,820
'Man'.
That's what they called me.

276
00:15:03,869 --> 00:15:07,187
Park Myung Soo!
Park Myung Soo!

277
00:15:09,666 --> 00:15:11,821

- Where?

that they're seeing?]

280

[An elephant is seen standing to greet them.]

281
00:15:19,373 --> 00:15:21,250
It looks like a real elephant.

282
00:15:21,251 --> 00:15:26,699
Animals that died of natural causes
have been preserved for the visitors.

283
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:29,291
No wonder.
It looks like a real elephant.

284
00:15:29,292 --> 00:15:30,557
Don't you think?

285
00:15:30,558 --> 00:15:34,283
Kwang Soo is just like the elephant
in that he's like an animal himself.

286
00:15:35,459 --> 00:15:37,743
What are you talking about?
I'm a real live human being.

287
00:15:39,324 --> 00:15:42,080
- What is this?
- Jae Suk. Myung Soo is a genius.

288
00:15:42,081 --> 00:15:47,182
On our way here, he came up with an
acrostic poem with the words, Running Man.

289
00:15:47,183 --> 00:15:48,593
- It was awesome.
- It was the best.

290
00:15:48,594 --> 00:15:50,917
It was perfect.
'Running Man' wouldn't be easy to do.

291
00:15:50,918 --> 00:15:54,195
- But he did it perfectly.
- He's likely to win the 2013 Grand Award.

292
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:57,616
[With his single acrostic poem attempt,
he's likely to win the Grand Award?]

293
00:15:57,616 --> 00:16:00,170
The Blue Team called to say they're going to
be late because they got lost on their way.

294
00:16:00,171 --> 00:16:02,760
Why do you keep people like that around?
They can't even find their way around.

295
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:05,445
- Just get rid of them.
- Suk Jin is with them.

296
00:16:05,446 --> 00:16:09,054
- We have to wait for them to do the mission.
- They can't even find their way.

297
00:16:09,055 --> 00:16:12,546
That's the only way for them to learn.
They even have the navigation system.

298
00:16:12,547 --> 00:16:14,866
Don't provoke Suk Jin if you can help it.

299
00:16:14,867 --> 00:16:19,774
Because he can be mean if provoked.
Even though we might find it entertaining.

300
00:16:19,775 --> 00:16:22,901
It's the lion's nature to go for
the weakest of the prey.

301
00:16:24,552 --> 00:16:28,213
- That's what a lion does.
- I can't believe he said that. That's awful!

302
00:16:28,214 --> 00:16:32,519
Have you ever seen a jungle lion
going after a young lamb?

- Why did you get lost on your way?

305
00:16:40,661 --> 00:16:42,870
- No kidding.
- Did you take the bus here or something?

306
00:16:42,871 --> 00:16:44,511
Driver Gae got us lost.

307
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:48,068
- Myung Soo here said some things about you.
- Like what?

308
00:16:48,069 --> 00:16:49,902
- You really are amazing though.
- Why?

309
00:16:49,903 --> 00:16:52,560
For having survived this long.

with his attack on the Impala.]

311

There's something I want to tell you.
You have no idea how tough this show is.

312
00:16:57,911 --> 00:16:59,932
You can just go home right now.
It's okay, we'll understand.

313
00:16:59,933 --> 00:17:02,267
You have no idea how physically
demanding this show is.

314
00:17:02,268 --> 00:17:03,760

A fixed rock, Suk Jin.]

318
00:17:12,629 --> 00:17:14,612
This is amazing.
I've only seen this on TV.

319
00:17:15,983 --> 00:17:17,017
Of course, it is.

320
00:17:17,018 --> 00:17:20,376
A lion will hunt down the weak cow.

321
00:17:21,286 --> 00:17:23,889
Weakness is written all over your face.

322
00:17:23,889 --> 00:17:25,525
Of course, it is.
Of course, it is.

323
00:17:25,526 --> 00:17:27,401
- Are you talking to me?
- Yes, I was referring to you.

324
00:17:27,402 --> 00:17:29,827
Of course, I meant you.
You're the only weak one here.

325
00:17:32,624 --> 00:17:34,958
No!

326
00:17:34,959 --> 00:17:37,193
I'm not done saying my part yet.

327
00:17:38,537 --> 00:17:41,590
I... think...

328
00:17:41,591 --> 00:17:43,776
[Tearing up at the truth?]

329
00:17:44,762 --> 00:17:46,634
[Knocked down.]

330
00:17:46,933 --> 00:17:48,775
[Unable to respond in time.]

331
00:17:51,371 --> 00:17:54,321
- No, I'm not going to say anything else.
- Don't air this, got it?

332
00:17:55,981 --> 00:17:58,008
Why did you react like that?
You're making us all feel really bad!

333
00:17:58,009 --> 00:18:00,294
[Looks genuinely hurt by the words
of Park-perm in the word game?]

334
00:18:00,295 --> 00:18:02,485
I'm not even in the mood
to joke around right now.

335
00:18:02,548 --> 00:18:06,740
- What do you mean, you're not in the mood?
- He didn't say those words as a joke.

336
00:18:06,775 --> 00:18:07,922
[We love you, Impala.]

337
00:18:07,923 --> 00:18:09,803
[I'm sorry, Suk Jin.
I was just joking around.]

338
00:18:09,804 --> 00:18:11,922
No, Suk Jin. Let's cut,
and go to a break right now.

339
00:18:11,923 --> 00:18:13,224
[Uncomfortable atmosphere.]

340
00:18:13,358 --> 00:18:15,819
What's our mission here?

341
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:19,135
<i>Okay, then I will tell you what
your first mission for the day is.</i>

342
00:18:19,385 --> 00:18:22,393
<i>In this portion of the animal exhibit</i>

343
00:18:22,394 --> 00:18:25,217
<i>you will find numerous different animals
on display for everyone to see.</i>

344
00:18:25,218 --> 00:18:27,119
<i>In various spots throughout the exhibition</i>

345
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:32,493
<i>you will find pieces of marked paper
with the name of the animal written on it.</i>

346
00:18:32,968 --> 00:18:36,452
<i>Each of you must find that piece of paper,
and return here as soon as possible. Go!</i>

347
00:18:36,453 --> 00:18:38,414
[Find the piece of paper and return
as soon as possible.]

348
00:18:38,842 --> 00:18:40,858
- Where are they?
- What kind of names is he talking about?

349
00:18:40,859 --> 00:18:43,974
[Everyone entering the exhibition
confused about what they're supposed to do.]

350
00:18:44,847 --> 00:18:48,507
[Very realistic animals are seen
displayed all over the place.]

351
00:18:48,508 --> 00:18:52,223
[Where are the pieces of paper
with the 'R' marker on them?]

352
00:18:52,224 --> 00:18:54,381
- Wow, they all look so real.
- Wow, I think I see one.

353
00:18:54,382 --> 00:18:55,683
Where?

354
00:18:59,106 --> 00:19:01,937
[Myung Soo discovers
the turtle's slip of paper!]

355
00:19:01,938 --> 00:19:03,366
Where?

356
00:19:04,915 --> 00:19:09,464
[All the members frantically searching
for the marked pieces of paper.]

357
00:19:10,288 --> 00:19:11,705
- I haven't found anything.
- We have to hurry back.

358
00:19:11,706 --> 00:19:13,173
We only need to find one of them?

359
00:19:13,174 --> 00:19:17,399
[But the mission seems to be
suspiciously simple...]

360
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:21,580
[Is this truly the end of their real mission?]

361
00:19:26,327 --> 00:19:28,678
[Where are you going?]

362
00:19:30,024 --> 00:19:31,404
I was only able to find one.

363
00:19:31,405 --> 00:19:35,324
[It looks as though everyone came back
with a piece of paper in their possession...]

364
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:40,858
<i>Weren't there so many different
animals in the exhibit that you were just in?</i>

365
00:19:40,859 --> 00:19:43,043
<i>I will now tell you what
your real mission is.</i>

366
00:19:43,044 --> 00:19:44,663
- What?
- Then this was a fake mission?

367
00:19:44,664 --> 00:19:47,616
<i>This mission is called,
'Find the wrong picture.'</i>

368
00:19:47,617 --> 00:19:50,507
<i>The truth is, inside the exhibit that
you were all just in...</i>

369
00:19:50,508 --> 00:19:55,265
<i>there was a setup that should have seemed
wrong and unnatural to everyone.</i>

370
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:59,312
[Find the abnormality inside the exhibition
that they were just running around in.]

371
00:19:59,313 --> 00:20:03,457
[We hope that all the viewers
play along with us!]

372
00:20:04,919 --> 00:20:07,846
<i>The mission that you just did gave
you a chance to look around the exhibit.</i>

373
00:20:07,847 --> 00:20:10,826
<i>The person who noticed the abnormality...
Do you see the mic behind you?</i>

374
00:20:10,827 --> 00:20:13,617
[The person who can shout out their answer
into the mic passes the true mission.]

375
00:20:13,618 --> 00:20:17,128
[The first team to have all their members
pass the mission is the winning team!]

376
00:20:17,129 --> 00:20:19,531
- No, it wasn't an animal.
- What did you see? Tell us what you saw.

377
00:20:19,532 --> 00:20:21,744
- What was it that you saw?
- You have to grab onto the mic.

378
00:20:21,745 --> 00:20:23,562
- Just take a guess.
- Say into the mic what you think you saw.

379
00:20:23,563 --> 00:20:25,694
- Say it into the mic.
- You could be the first one to pass.

380
00:20:26,064 --> 00:20:28,363
Once you grab the mic,
you have to pull it down towards you.

381
00:20:29,981 --> 00:20:31,500
Only the person who wants to take
a guess can grab the mic.

382
00:20:31,501 --> 00:20:33,228
[Could it be that he really knows?]

383
00:20:33,229 --> 00:20:35,439
- Hello.
- Just say what you think the answer is.

384
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,954
It really is an honor to be back
on an SBS program.

385
00:20:39,282 --> 00:20:43,582
From what I remember seeing...
I saw a mannequin inside the exhibit.

386
00:20:43,583 --> 00:20:46,415
- I don't remember seeing anything like that.
- You're saying there was a mannequin?

387
00:20:46,416 --> 00:20:49,480
[Could that be the correct answer?]

388
00:20:49,481 --> 00:20:51,160
I don't remember seeing anything
that was out of place.

389
00:20:51,161 --> 00:20:53,827
- Can you give me another chance?
- You have exactly one minute.

390
00:20:53,828 --> 00:20:55,841
You need to wait a moment.

391
00:20:55,842 --> 00:20:57,554
- I will tell you when.
- What are you doing?

392
00:20:57,555 --> 00:21:01,354
You have exactly one minute.
So it'll be the same as before.

393
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:03,720
[Today's guests both seems to have
quite the competitive streak in them.]

394
00:21:03,721 --> 00:21:05,541
- You have to be back within a minute.
- Ready, set, go!

395
00:21:05,542 --> 00:21:07,212
[Must return within one minute.]

396
00:21:07,213 --> 00:21:09,087
I couldn't find anything earlier.

397
00:21:09,088 --> 00:21:12,910
[Taking another look around the exhibition...]

398
00:21:12,911 --> 00:21:17,954
[What's the abnormality
that they're supposed to find?]

399
00:21:19,453 --> 00:21:21,296
- I don't see anything.
- What is it?

400
00:21:22,719 --> 00:21:25,812
[IU seemed to have discovered something,
and rushes out of the room!]

401
00:21:26,662 --> 00:21:28,374
[Did Kwang Soo discover something as well?]

402
00:21:28,452 --> 00:21:32,455
[The abnormality...
Have you discovered it too?]

403
00:21:34,301 --> 00:21:36,991
[Huh?]

404
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:39,956
[Jae Suk also seems to have
discovered something!]

405
00:21:40,719 --> 00:21:42,907
Was that a beaver or an otter?

406
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,763
Run!

407
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,193
Run, IU!

408
00:21:49,917 --> 00:21:53,055
[Those who seemed to have found the answer
are rushing back to the starting line!]

409
00:21:53,056 --> 00:21:54,905
- How am I supposed to grab that?
- Go grab it!

410
00:21:56,051 --> 00:21:59,330
[The mic is placed too high for IU to grab.]

411
00:21:59,331 --> 00:22:01,017
There's no time!
Grab the mic!

412
00:22:01,018 --> 00:22:02,919
- IU!
- You're not going to be able to grab it!

413
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,563
Come here, IU.

414
00:22:06,627 --> 00:22:09,983
[Jae Suk pulls IU up onto his back.]

415
00:22:09,984 --> 00:22:11,492
[But Big-nose Brother gets in the way again!]

416
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:15,790
[A bloody battle for the mic.]

417
00:22:18,202 --> 00:22:19,486
Grab it!

418
00:22:21,996 --> 00:22:23,094
Grab it!

419
00:22:23,095 --> 00:22:25,164
[She got the mic!]

420
00:22:25,165 --> 00:22:27,897
[What will her answer be?]

421
00:22:27,898 --> 00:22:29,247
The beaver...

422
00:22:29,248 --> 00:22:31,353
- You have to say the exact name.
- The beaver.

423
00:22:32,885 --> 00:22:34,479
- It's a four letter word.
- What?

424
00:22:35,196 --> 00:22:36,499
- Go on with your answer.
- It's an otter.

425
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:39,004
- The beaver...
- No, it's an otter.

426
00:22:39,332 --> 00:22:40,826
The otter...

427
00:22:43,496 --> 00:22:46,558
The otter was holding a chancel.

428
00:22:46,944 --> 00:22:49,346
The otter was holding a chancel.

429
00:22:49,347 --> 00:22:50,816
[The otter was holding a chancel?]

430
00:22:50,817 --> 00:22:53,931
- It wasn't the right answer?
- It's wrong.

431
00:22:56,827 --> 00:22:59,117
[Just then, giant Giraffe leaps up
and grabs the mic.]

432
00:22:59,118 --> 00:23:03,755
The otter... was holding a recorder.

433
00:23:05,799 --> 00:23:07,703
[Do I still look like an otter to you?]

434
00:23:09,456 --> 00:23:10,638
Jump up.

435
00:23:13,504 --> 00:23:16,399
[Total chaos.]

436
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,105
Please let go of me.

437
00:23:18,106 --> 00:23:19,937
Grab it, IU!

438
00:23:19,938 --> 00:23:23,802
[Just then...
Tiger jumps up and grabs the mic.]

439
00:23:23,803 --> 00:23:26,468
The beaver was holding onto a chancel.

440
00:23:26,469 --> 00:23:29,091
- Repeat your answer one more time.
- The beaver was holding onto a chancel.

441
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:31,872
[Kkuk answers correctly.]

442
00:23:36,612 --> 00:23:40,249
[The beaver, not the otter,
is holding onto a chancel in his hands.]

443
00:23:41,178 --> 00:23:44,651
[If IU had just said beaver from the start,
she would've gotten the right answer.]

444
00:23:44,652 --> 00:23:46,496
She would've answered it correctly
if it hadn't been for Jae Suk.

445
00:23:46,497 --> 00:23:49,895
- What were you thinking?
- Why did you sabotage her?

446
00:23:49,896 --> 00:23:52,080
He was acting really frustrated with IU when
he kept telling her that it was an otter.

447
00:23:52,081 --> 00:23:53,794
Did Myung Soo go home?

448
00:23:57,169 --> 00:23:58,712
I have no idea.

449
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,485
Ready, set, go!

450
00:24:02,486 --> 00:24:05,898
[Blank Ji passes Round Two,
and off to Round Three!]

451
00:24:05,899 --> 00:24:07,524
Either Myung Soo or Ha Ha
needs to get the next one.

452
00:24:07,525 --> 00:24:12,967
[What will they find this time?]

453
00:24:14,532 --> 00:24:17,785
[Kid Ro-Ro pretending to see something
to fake everyone out.]

454
00:24:19,048 --> 00:24:21,180
This is part of the normal setup, right?

455
00:24:23,937 --> 00:24:28,702
[Join us in our search, viewers.]

456
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:38,198
[Do you see it?]

457
00:24:42,528 --> 00:24:45,191
[IU is the first to discover
the abnormality again!]

458
00:24:49,536 --> 00:24:53,439
[All the other members also discover
the abnormality one by one.]

459
00:24:56,721 --> 00:24:59,967
[The correct answer- The shoe brush found
on top of the zebra's head.]

460
00:25:01,233 --> 00:25:03,474
[Must hurry and grab the mic!]

461
00:25:03,475 --> 00:25:05,156
[What did they all see?]

462
00:25:06,596 --> 00:25:09,911
[IU's seems to always be in a rush.]

463
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:16,867
[But Gary beats her to the punch,
and is the first to grab the mic.]

464
00:25:18,006 --> 00:25:19,588
- Can I guess the answer?
- Yes.

465
00:25:19,589 --> 00:25:20,602
[No!]

466
00:25:20,603 --> 00:25:23,027
There was a shoe brush
on top of the pony's head.

467
00:25:23,358 --> 00:25:26,432
[What... a pony?]

468
00:25:26,433 --> 00:25:27,577
That's not the right answer?

469
00:25:28,748 --> 00:25:30,400
What is it?

470
00:25:30,910 --> 00:25:33,299
- Can you help me grab the mic?
- Okay, we'll help you.

471
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:37,311
[The men on the opposing teams are
helpless when it comes to IU's pleas.]

472

One, two, three.

473
00:25:39,932 --> 00:25:41,530
I'd like to see what your answer is.

474
00:25:41,992 --> 00:25:44,206
The zebra.

475
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,734
A zebra!
I can't believe I didn't say that!

476
00:25:47,735 --> 00:25:49,916
[Finally realized
why he got his answer wrong.]

477
00:25:51,152 --> 00:25:53,299
[IU answers correctly.]

478
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:55,418
Aren't they called 'ponies' from
time to time?

479
00:25:56,971 --> 00:26:02,048
[The correct answer is,
on top of the ZEBRA's head is a shoe brush.]

480
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:05,200
Aren't they called 'ponies'

[Just which country do you think refers
to them as ponies?]

482
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:11,021
The shoe brush was on top of the zebra's head.
What did you say for your answer?

483
00:26:11,022 --> 00:26:14,352
- The shoe brush on the zebra's head.
- I said that it was on a pony's head.

484
00:26:14,353 --> 00:26:15,555
[Even he finds himself to be pathetic...]

485
00:26:15,556 --> 00:26:17,375
- You said it was a pony?
- Did you get the answer, IU?

486
00:26:17,376 --> 00:26:19,855
- Yes.
- We did it!

487
00:26:19,856 --> 00:26:22,344
- How could you have lost to IU?
- You did great.

488
00:26:23,286 --> 00:26:25,366
Why did I call the zebra a pony?

489
00:26:25,366 --> 00:26:28,857
It's because I'm not a very smart person.

490
00:26:28,858 --> 00:26:31,290
- Gary is the only one left on the Blue Team.
- We have to stop him no matter what.

491
00:26:31,291 --> 00:26:33,344
- Kang Gary, give me your bag.
- Blue Team wins if Gary passes.

492
00:26:33,345 --> 00:26:34,617
Blue Team will win first place.

493
00:26:34,618 --> 00:26:37,142
[Entrusting his bag that contains the card
with Blank Ji to be able to move faster.]

494
00:26:37,142 --> 00:26:39,970
What if Song Ji Hyo looks inside your bag
and sees which card you picked?

495
00:26:39,971 --> 00:26:41,877
It's okay.

496
00:26:42,116 --> 00:26:43,976
I have nothing to hide when
it comes to her.

497
00:26:43,977 --> 00:26:46,004
[Look at these two!]

498
00:26:46,005 --> 00:26:48,107
- I have nothing to hide from her.
- What are you talking about?

499
00:26:48,108 --> 00:26:49,711
[There is no such thing as secrets
between the Monday Couple?]

500
00:26:49,711 --> 00:26:51,695
- The next one is extremely easy.
- Okay, we understand.

501
00:26:51,696 --> 00:26:54,889
There are only four of you left.
Ready, set, go!

502
00:26:54,890 --> 00:26:57,140
[No rest for the weary.
Time for Round Five!]

503
00:26:59,269 --> 00:27:01,200
- You have Gary's bag?
- Yeah.

504
00:27:05,664 --> 00:27:07,025
- Why?
- Let me take a look.

505
00:27:07,026 --> 00:27:10,271
- No. Why would you do that?
- This is an individual competition.

506
00:27:10,272 --> 00:27:12,243
- What about it? So what if it is?
- Let's look at it together.

507
00:27:12,244 --> 00:27:13,478
No, I don't want to.

508
00:27:13,479 --> 00:27:15,500
She's so considerate to Gary.

509
00:27:15,501 --> 00:27:18,457
Peeking in his bag when he's not here
is a very cowardly thing to do.

510
00:27:19,077 --> 00:27:21,590
[Meanwhile...]

511
00:27:21,591 --> 00:27:23,767
[Jae Suk and Myung Soo simultaneously sees
something as soon as they enter the room.]

512
00:27:24,189 --> 00:27:27,130
[One animal looking quite warm and cozy.]

513
00:27:27,131 --> 00:27:28,832
<i>I don't think I can run anymore!</i>

514
00:27:29,346 --> 00:27:33,431
[Everyone back at the starting line is still
trying to take a peek at Gary's card.]

515
00:27:33,432 --> 00:27:35,083
- I just figured something out.
- Really? How?

516
00:27:35,794 --> 00:27:39,667
[Giraffe having peeked at other members'
cards when they were unaware.]

517
00:27:39,668 --> 00:27:41,479
Your bag is wide open.
We all saw your card.

518
00:27:43,393 --> 00:27:45,065
Unbelievable.

519
00:27:50,003 --> 00:27:53,081
[If Jae Suk answers it first,
then the Red Team will win the game!]

520
00:27:53,724 --> 00:27:56,849
[Haroro trying to stop Jae Suk in his
feeble attempt to stop him from winning.]

521
00:27:56,874 --> 00:28:00,007
- Hurry! Hurry!
- It's all over if Gary gets the answer!

522
00:28:00,839 --> 00:28:02,489
He's not going to be able to grab the mic.

523
00:28:02,761 --> 00:28:05,767
[The mic not wanting to cooperate
with Myung Soo's desperate attempt.]

524
00:28:06,887 --> 00:28:10,018
[Oh! He grabs the mic!]

525
00:28:11,677 --> 00:28:14,260
- There's no way.
- The wildcat.

526
00:28:15,142 --> 00:28:17,697
The leopard?
The tiger?

527
00:28:18,881 --> 00:28:21,990
[Wildcat? Leopard? Tiger?
What are you?]

528
00:28:23,024 --> 00:28:24,279
- What is the animal you're referring to?
- It's a leopard.

529
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:25,910
- A leopard?
- The scarf.

530
00:28:26,293 --> 00:28:27,826
It's wearing a scarf around its neck.

531
00:28:27,827 --> 00:28:29,571
A scarf.

532
00:28:29,638 --> 00:28:31,136
- Be more precise.
- A scarf. The neck.

533
00:28:31,137 --> 00:28:33,316
Just say it!
Say it in a complete sentence.

534
00:28:33,317 --> 00:28:35,388
The leopard is wearing a scarf.

535
00:28:35,389 --> 00:28:37,403
[Barely manages to spit out
the correct answer.]

536
00:28:38,698 --> 00:28:40,980
- You have to get it this time, Jae Suk.
- Okay.

537
00:28:40,981 --> 00:28:43,714
[The final battle!
Only one person from each team remains.]

538
00:28:43,715 --> 00:28:48,753
[Blue Team's Gary vs. Red Team's Jae Suk
vs. White Team's Ha Ha.]

539
00:28:48,754 --> 00:28:49,838
Ready.

540
00:28:50,759 --> 00:28:54,085
[The final round of the game starts now!]

541
00:28:57,526 --> 00:29:00,451
[See what you can find!]

542
00:29:07,257 --> 00:29:11,118
[Even an impala needs to
protect its foot.]

543
00:29:12,341 --> 00:29:15,321
[Jae Suk is first to
discover the abnormality!]

544
00:29:18,251 --> 00:29:21,155
[Everyone rushes back after
having made their discovery!]

545
00:29:21,156 --> 00:29:22,596
Grab him!

546
00:29:24,037 --> 00:29:26,905
[This is the round that'll determine
who the victor of the game will be!]

547
00:29:26,906 --> 00:29:29,591
[Jae Suk is the first to make it back.]

548
00:29:29,592 --> 00:29:31,369
[Jump!]

549
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:33,541
[Ah...]

550
00:29:35,577 --> 00:29:38,894
[A fierce battle for the mic
befitting of the final round.]

551
00:29:40,085 --> 00:29:42,287
Look into IU's eyes, Jae Suk!

552
00:29:42,288 --> 00:29:43,951
[Please!]

553
00:29:44,577 --> 00:29:46,783
Think of it as you playing basketball.

554
00:29:55,652 --> 00:29:58,720
[The final ownership
of the mic goes to Haroro.]

555
00:30:01,456 --> 00:30:03,582
The impala!

556
00:30:03,583 --> 00:30:05,394
The impala...

557
00:30:05,395 --> 00:30:09,137
The impala...
is wearing a running shoe!

558
00:30:09,138 --> 00:30:12,472
- The impala is wearing a running shoe!
- On which foot?

559
00:30:14,252 --> 00:30:17,084
['Ha-Myung-Kook' wins the first game!]

560
00:30:17,085 --> 00:30:18,768
I thought Gary was going to do it.

561
00:30:18,769 --> 00:30:20,862
One, two, three, four!

562
00:30:20,863 --> 00:30:22,755
[Celebratory step dance.]

563
00:30:25,485 --> 00:30:27,974
- Hey, why are you in the middle?
- Sorry.

564
00:30:27,975 --> 00:30:30,294
- Are you serious?
- Who cares? We're on the same team.

565
00:30:32,187 --> 00:30:34,190
- Weren't you in the middle?
- Yeah, I was in the middle.

566
00:30:34,985 --> 00:30:38,636
- Try to remember how we used to do it.
- Look at what he's trying to do over there.

567
00:30:38,637 --> 00:30:40,497
I was in the middle.

568
00:30:40,498 --> 00:30:43,349
[Anyways, the winning team of the
exhibition mission is...]

569
00:30:43,350 --> 00:30:45,999
[Ha-Myung-Kook]

570
00:30:47,447 --> 00:30:51,831
<i>The members of the winning team now have the
chance to trade in their cards for a new one.</i>

571
00:30:51,832 --> 00:30:57,234
<i>Ticketing booths are available for you to
make your trade should you choose to do so.</i>

572
00:30:58,784 --> 00:31:01,103
<i>Many of you know
which card I have, don't you?</i>

573
00:31:01,104 --> 00:31:03,245
<i>- Yes.
- We all know.</i>

574
00:31:03,246 --> 00:31:05,489
- We can keep the card we have too.
- Yeah, okay.

575
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:10,082
- Keep it or trade it in.
- One or the other. Trade it or keep it.

576
00:31:10,130 --> 00:31:13,166
[Myung Soo with his original lamb card.]

577
00:31:13,167 --> 00:31:14,958
[I'm just going to keep it.]

578
00:31:16,333 --> 00:31:19,851
I had originally picked the wolf card.

579
00:31:19,852 --> 00:31:26,251
I had originally picked the wolf...
and I'm going to choose the wolf again.

580
00:31:26,252 --> 00:31:28,356
[Kook also chooses to
keep his original decision.]

581
00:31:28,357 --> 00:31:30,388
Since everyone seems to be confused
about what we're about to do...

582
00:31:30,389 --> 00:31:32,880
[And lastly, Haroro, whose card has been
seen by many other members...]

583
00:31:32,881 --> 00:31:37,355
[He switches his original lamb card
in for the wolf card.]

584
00:31:37,356 --> 00:31:40,876
[Due to Ha Ha's exchange, the
count changes to 6 wolves and 3 lambs.]

585
00:31:40,877 --> 00:31:44,039
[Ha Ha unknowingly changed the result to
match the count that he had voted for.]

586
00:31:51,881 --> 00:31:54,725
[Current correct answer.]

587
00:31:55,975 --> 00:31:57,198
<i>We got a text.</i>

588
00:31:57,693 --> 00:31:58,775
What does it say?

589
00:31:59,570 --> 00:32:01,944
- There are two people with the right guess.
- Seriously?

590
00:32:02,737 --> 00:32:07,740
[With Ha Ha's trade, it's 6 wolves and 3 lambs.
IU and Ha Ha currently have the correct answer.]

591
00:32:08,524 --> 00:32:10,331
- Two people with the correct guess?
- Two people with the correct guess.

592
00:32:10,332 --> 00:32:14,351
[IU isn't even aware that
she's one of them.]

593
00:32:14,352 --> 00:32:15,614
Let's go!

594
00:32:15,615 --> 00:32:18,352
[Off to the next mission location.]

595
00:32:18,353 --> 00:32:19,773
Which card did Suk Jin have?

596
00:32:19,774 --> 00:32:21,652
- Wolf.
- Really? The wolf?

597
00:32:21,653 --> 00:32:24,369
I knew you would've seen his card.

598
00:32:24,370 --> 00:32:26,884
[Even though she pretended not to see it,
IU had taken a peek at Suk Jin's card.]

599
00:32:26,885 --> 00:32:30,415
- There really are a lot of wolves.
- Yes, there are a lot of wolves.

600
00:32:30,416 --> 00:32:33,174
That's what you think, Jae Suk.
But there are quite a few lambs.

601
00:32:33,175 --> 00:32:34,622
- Really?
- Seriously?

602
00:32:34,623 --> 00:32:37,759
- There are quite a few lambs.
- But think about it.

603
00:32:38,065 --> 00:32:39,465
- You're a wolf too, right, IU?
- Yes.

604
00:32:39,466 --> 00:32:42,875
- I'm a wolf too.
- And Kwang Soo's a wolf.

605
00:32:42,876 --> 00:32:45,526
That's already quite a few wolves.

606
00:32:45,527 --> 00:32:47,511
[Kwang Soo lied to them about picking wolf.]

607
00:32:47,512 --> 00:32:51,092
What I think is... Ha Ha had the lamb,
and we're only unaware of four cards.

608
00:32:51,093 --> 00:32:54,623
- But they had the chance to change it.
- Myung Soo had the lamb.

609
00:32:54,624 --> 00:32:56,998
- Ha Ha also had the lamb card.
- Myung Soo had the lamb card?

610
00:32:56,999 --> 00:32:58,737
- How do you know that?
- I saw it.

611
00:32:58,738 --> 00:32:59,948
You saw it?

612
00:33:00,516 --> 00:33:02,083
- Jong Kook also had a lamb card.
- Really?

613
00:33:02,084 --> 00:33:04,960
[Jong Kook has a lamb card?]

614
00:33:04,961 --> 00:33:09,320
[Giraffe starts his game of conning.]

615
00:33:09,616 --> 00:33:12,501
[Unlike Giraffe's claim,
Gary chose the wolf.]

616
00:33:12,502 --> 00:33:15,253
- So there are quite a few lambs.
- There are a lot of lambs.

617
00:33:15,969 --> 00:33:19,458
[His face no longer even changes as he
lies blatantly to other people.]

618
00:33:19,957 --> 00:33:23,739
After checking other people out,
I've noticed there are a lot of wolves.

619
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:24,831
- Right?
- Yeah.

620
00:33:24,832 --> 00:33:28,787
I've given it some thought, but
after figuring out what others wrote

621
00:33:28,788 --> 00:33:33,258
we should only change the cards that we have
in order to match our guesses.

622
00:33:33,259 --> 00:33:36,040
- Okay, agreed.
- You understand what I'm saying?

623
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:41,575
[On the other hand, the traitorous Giraffe
is doing what he can to deceive his team.]

624
00:33:41,576 --> 00:33:42,790
<i>I'm going with the wolf.</i>

625
00:33:44,064 --> 00:33:47,796
[Blue Team agrees to work together
to come in first in the missions.]

626
00:33:47,797 --> 00:33:51,540
[That will be their only chance to change
the cards that they have.]

627
00:33:51,541 --> 00:33:55,136
Myung Soo is our lucky charm.
Things are going great with him on our team.

628
00:33:55,137 --> 00:33:57,020
[Ha-Myung-Kook is flying high from their win.]

629
00:33:57,021 --> 00:33:59,939
How long has it been since
Ha-Myung-Kook has been together?

630
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:02,325
- Seven or eight years?
- I think you're right.

631
00:34:02,326 --> 00:34:04,387
- That long?
- Time really flies by.

632
00:34:04,388 --> 00:34:06,067
We really used to have a great time.

633
00:34:06,068 --> 00:34:08,751
- I got something.
- What did you get?

634
00:34:08,786 --> 00:34:14,186
<i>[We will notify the winning team what the
current count of wolves vs. the lambs are.]</i>

635
00:34:14,187 --> 00:34:19,075
[The winning team will be notified of what
the current count of wolves vs. the lambs is.]

636
00:34:19,076 --> 00:34:21,655
- This is a huge advantage.
- I didn't know they'd do that.

637
00:34:21,656 --> 00:34:24,194
- We have to win first no matter what.
- You really are a lucky charm.

638
00:34:24,195 --> 00:34:26,645
- Right?
- The game is in the bag now.

639
00:34:26,646 --> 00:34:30,848
[Once they're notified of the current count,
they can switch their cards to match it.]

640
00:34:30,849 --> 00:34:33,927
[Wolves- Six; Lambs- Three.]

641
00:34:33,928 --> 00:34:38,493
[Ha Ha has the correct estimate.]

642
00:34:38,494 --> 00:34:43,728
[With the recent exchange of his card,
he had changed the count to match his guess.]

643
00:34:44,478 --> 00:34:48,372
[Okay... we just need to keep this going.]

644
00:34:48,736 --> 00:34:52,129
[And Jong Kook's guess had been
seven wolves and two lambs.]

645
00:34:52,130 --> 00:34:54,762
[Okay, it's getting closer now.]

646
00:34:57,499 --> 00:35:00,568
Once someone finds out what
the current count is...

647
00:35:00,569 --> 00:35:04,704
they can do whatever they want with
their card to match it up with their guess.

648
00:35:05,318 --> 00:35:07,303
- To increase their chance at a win.
- True.

649
00:35:08,893 --> 00:35:14,441
[It is crucial to continue to win first place
so that they keep this truth to themselves.]

650
00:35:14,442 --> 00:35:16,721
I bet it must be a lot of fun
to do things like this every week.

651
00:35:16,722 --> 00:35:18,734
I really want to be on Running Man.

652
00:35:20,343 --> 00:35:23,313
- Are you making a formal request?
- If I want to join the cast...

653
00:35:23,642 --> 00:35:26,540
since this is similar to the other show,
I know I can do it if Ha Ha leaves.

654
00:35:32,352 --> 00:35:36,133
[The Red Team is the first to arrive
at the second mission location.]

655
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:37,391
Come over this way, please.

656
00:35:37,392 --> 00:35:39,544
- Come this way, please.
- What are we doing here?

657
00:35:39,545 --> 00:35:41,065
[Spicy stewed rib restaurant in Soowon.]

658
00:35:41,066 --> 00:35:43,008
[Huh?]

659
00:35:43,009 --> 00:35:44,949
[Just what in the world...]

660
00:35:44,950 --> 00:35:47,398
What is this?
What is this water tank doing here?

661
00:35:47,882 --> 00:35:51,527
[While one person goes in the tank and
shouts out 'Ow' in one breath...]

662
00:35:51,527 --> 00:35:55,687
[the other two members have to gather up all
the scattered stools inside the restaurant.]

663
00:35:55,688 --> 00:35:58,108
[Just the sight of the water tank alone
is enough to terrify them.]

664
00:35:58,109 --> 00:36:00,195
Why are you making us play a game like this
at the spicy rib restaurant?

665
00:36:00,196 --> 00:36:03,582
- I thought we were going to be eating ribs.
- This wasn't an eating competition?

666
00:36:03,583 --> 00:36:06,139
Seriously, what kind of a game is this
to be playing at a rib restaurant?

667
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:07,986
If you can't complete the mission before the
person is 'ow' loses their breath...

668
00:36:07,986 --> 00:36:09,503
- Then the person is dunked in the water?
- And it's a failed mission.

669
00:36:09,503 --> 00:36:12,926
- What is that chair all about?
- You'll find out soon enough.

670
00:36:12,927 --> 00:36:15,102
[The chair is where one will be sitting
while shouting out, 'ow'...]

671
00:36:15,103 --> 00:36:17,131
While howling?

672
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:21,660
IU looks like a mermaid.

673
00:36:21,661 --> 00:36:24,415
[Trying to convince IU to take the chair?]

674
00:36:24,416 --> 00:36:27,810
[The older men telling sweet IU
to take one for the team.]

675
00:36:31,071 --> 00:36:33,597
[Ha-Myung-Kook saunters up to others
with ease and confidence.]

676
00:36:33,598 --> 00:36:35,739
It's really crucial to come in at first place.

677
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:37,587
The game is all over now.
You might as well all just go home.

678
00:36:37,588 --> 00:36:40,317
- We've got this game in the bag.
- You won't know until this is all over.

679
00:36:41,451 --> 00:36:45,166
In this round, first and second place winners
will be alerted to what the current count is.

680
00:36:45,303 --> 00:36:49,964
And like before, only the team that comes in
at first place has the chance to trade.

681
00:36:50,302 --> 00:36:53,060
We choose Myung Soo to be the one
to sit in the chair.

682
00:36:53,061 --> 00:36:55,101
[Ha-Myung-Kook chooses Myung Soo?]

683
00:36:55,102 --> 00:36:57,526
This is the reason why you're
here, Myung Soo.

684
00:36:57,527 --> 00:36:59,282
Don't you want the award?

685
00:36:59,283 --> 00:37:01,918
[Doing this would further his chances
of winning the grand award?]

686
00:37:01,919 --> 00:37:04,184
Even though this is my first appearance
on SBS this whole year?

687
00:37:04,184 --> 00:37:06,109
- This is my first appearance on SBS.
- But this could be your chance.

688
00:37:06,110 --> 00:37:08,126
- Is that even possible?
- Of course.

689
00:37:08,127 --> 00:37:09,727
Then I'll do it.

690
00:37:09,728 --> 00:37:12,619
- This one thing could be my chance?
- Of course, this could be your chance.

691
00:37:13,910 --> 00:37:16,225
- He sure does love his awards.
- Yes, you're right.

692
00:37:16,226 --> 00:37:20,285
- Hey, stand right up at the line.
- Talk to me in honorifics.

693
00:37:20,286 --> 00:37:21,958
Please stand at the line.

694
00:37:21,959 --> 00:37:23,530
- Here?
- Yes.

695
00:37:23,531 --> 00:37:25,922
- No, they can't do that.
- Why are you trying to ruin this?

696
00:37:25,923 --> 00:37:28,441
Don't try to cheat.
Come on now.

697
00:37:28,442 --> 00:37:30,908
Your shorts and the bag seriously...

698
00:37:32,547 --> 00:37:34,301
[Ha-Myung-Kook, Start.]

699
00:37:40,159 --> 00:37:42,493
[The chair is slowly getting
lowered towards the water!]

700
00:37:43,918 --> 00:37:47,788
[The other two members must gather up all
the stools before Myung Soo's howling stops.]

701
00:37:49,683 --> 00:37:53,390
[Which of the two will be finished first?]

702
00:37:59,723 --> 00:38:02,054
[Slowly starting to get
submerged in the water.]

703
00:38:04,866 --> 00:38:07,943
[Once he's underwater, then his howling...]

704
00:38:08,985 --> 00:38:12,323
[Will it be the stools first,
or will it be the submersion?]

705
00:38:19,397 --> 00:38:21,312
[The howling is stopped!]

706
00:38:23,263 --> 00:38:26,164
[Fails the mission by the split of a hair!]

707
00:38:26,913 --> 00:38:28,740
Look! He looks like a fish!

708
00:38:31,313 --> 00:38:33,680
[A rare species of fish!]

709
00:38:36,585 --> 00:38:39,194
[Looking quite similar to the
monstrous looking fish.]

710
00:38:39,195 --> 00:38:41,681
- How can he look like that?
- What the heck is that!

711
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:50,314
Isn't that Han Moo?

712
00:38:50,315 --> 00:38:53,301
- I thought that you were Han Moo!
- What did you just say?

713
00:38:53,302 --> 00:38:56,406
[You do look just like him...]

714
00:38:56,898 --> 00:38:59,201
[Ji Hyo is in a cultural state of shock.]

715
00:38:59,789 --> 00:39:02,372
You've never been so shocked by
Myung Soo's looks before, have you?

716
00:39:02,373 --> 00:39:04,664
[Breaking out into a fit of laughter after
seeing Myung Soo's face.]

717
00:39:04,665 --> 00:39:07,757
[His unique look that the heavens
have bestowed upon him.]

718
00:39:10,118 --> 00:39:11,934
Do you think that was enough to
get me that award?

719
00:39:11,982 --> 00:39:14,173
[So that's what he's really after!]

720
00:39:14,174 --> 00:39:15,373
You think I may be able to get it?

721
00:39:15,374 --> 00:39:18,357
[His fish imitation may land
him the award.]

722
00:39:18,358 --> 00:39:21,229
I've never lost in the looks department to
anyone, but I think Myung Soo's got me beat.

723
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:23,361
You're quite handsome compared to him.

724
00:39:23,362 --> 00:39:25,783
We needed three more seconds.
We were pretty fast, weren't we?

725
00:39:25,784 --> 00:39:27,936
[Mere three seconds
could've meant their victory.]

726
00:39:28,339 --> 00:39:31,363
[For the Red Team,
Kwang Soo takes the howling chair.]

727
00:39:31,364 --> 00:39:33,316
- I'm going to do this for our team!
- Ah!

728
00:39:33,317 --> 00:39:35,367
I-U- I miss you!

729
00:39:36,636 --> 00:39:38,655
- Are you all ready?
- We will show you what winning looks like!

730
00:39:38,656 --> 00:39:40,789
If you don't get it done, IU will
have to get on that chair next time.

731
00:39:40,790 --> 00:39:43,331
[IU volunteers to sit on the chair
if they don't succeed in their first try.]

732
00:39:44,741 --> 00:39:46,572
[Red Team- Start.]

733
00:39:53,650 --> 00:39:56,865
[They seem to be stumbling around a bit...]

734
00:39:58,361 --> 00:40:00,017
IU is really good.

735
00:40:02,263 --> 00:40:03,974
[Kwang Soo is slowly starting to
get submerged in the water.]

736
00:40:07,066 --> 00:40:10,401
[There are still so many
stools left to gather.]

737
00:40:13,179 --> 00:40:16,286
[Fighting the inevitable.]

738
00:40:18,706 --> 00:40:21,273
[Which of the two sides will be first?]

739
00:40:34,539 --> 00:40:37,486
[Ultimately submerged underwater
and his howling stops.]

740
00:40:37,574 --> 00:40:39,984
[Red Team fails.]

741
00:40:39,985 --> 00:40:42,796
[All they needed was to
bring the stools back!]

742
00:40:42,797 --> 00:40:45,009
- I couldn't do it anymore!
- You guys were so close.

743
00:40:45,010 --> 00:40:46,685
You just needed to bring it back.

744
00:40:48,330 --> 00:40:51,005
- Kwang Soo did the best he could.
- He really did.

745
00:40:51,006 --> 00:40:52,971
He really did what he could to win.

746
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:56,350
This really is so disappointing.

747
00:40:56,351 --> 00:40:58,626
[Will IU really be the next one up
on the chair?]

748
00:41:01,295 --> 00:41:03,763
[Big-nose takes the chair for the Blue Team.]

749
00:41:03,764 --> 00:41:05,880
- Okay, 25 seconds is what you need?
- Okay.

750
00:41:07,329 --> 00:41:09,500
[Blue Team- Start]

751
00:41:12,154 --> 00:41:15,083
[Monday Couple is on fire!]

752
00:41:15,084 --> 00:41:16,559
Get the ones up front!

753
00:41:23,256 --> 00:41:26,914
[Speedy Ji Hyo... and speedy Gary!]

754
00:41:28,333 --> 00:41:30,747
They really do work well together,
don't they?

755
00:41:31,948 --> 00:41:34,819
[Monday Couple on their way to
opening up their own shop.]

756
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:47,634
[His howling starts to come to an end...]

757
00:41:51,592 --> 00:41:54,654
[Fails from the halting of the howling.]

758
00:41:55,390 --> 00:41:58,113
[Pathetically fails the mission.]

759
00:41:58,983 --> 00:42:02,840
[They were so close to winning.
Just needed to bring the stools out.]

760
00:42:02,841 --> 00:42:05,000
- We just needed to bring out the stools.
- That team, seriously.

761
00:42:05,001 --> 00:42:07,636
[Ah... the troublemaker.]

762
00:42:08,407 --> 00:42:10,851
[Ha-Myung-Kook team gets
Myung Soo back in the chair.]

763
00:42:11,559 --> 00:42:16,431
If we win it this time...
that seals the deal for Myung Soo.

764
00:42:22,948 --> 00:42:25,785
[Why the sudden halt to the game?]

765
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:31,182
[The reason being... no sound
could be heard from Myung Soo.]

766
00:42:31,183 --> 00:42:34,317
[Disqualified because no sound was heard
after the whistle blow.]

767
00:42:34,489 --> 00:42:37,058
[Everyone who witnessed the start
can testify to the fail.]

768
00:42:42,803 --> 00:42:45,125
- We can't excuse them for that.
- Can you let us start over?

769
00:42:45,126 --> 00:42:47,875
Come on.
Just let us start over again.

770
00:42:49,617 --> 00:42:50,911
Get down from that chair.

771
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:56,561
- Can't I just gather up my breath first?
- Just get down from there!

772
00:42:57,321 --> 00:43:00,812
If I ever got a mother-in-law like you,
I'd just move out of the house.

773
00:43:01,169 --> 00:43:03,825
Why would you worry about
meeting a mother-in-law like that?

774
00:43:04,696 --> 00:43:07,718
Who cares if I said anything about
meeting a mother-in-law like that?

775
00:43:07,813 --> 00:43:10,803
- Why are you saying things like that to him?
- It's not like he's the daughter-in-law.

776
00:43:10,804 --> 00:43:13,926
- Why are you being so mean to Myung Soo?
- I'm the bad daughter-in-law. So what?

777
00:43:14,945 --> 00:43:16,420
Put your shoes back on.

778
00:43:16,421 --> 00:43:18,425
[Bickering back and forth whenever
either one of them opens their mouth.]

779
00:43:18,425 --> 00:43:19,976
[Not even bothering to put
his shoes back on...]

780
00:43:19,977 --> 00:43:21,347
Fine, I'll put my shoes back on!

781
00:43:21,997 --> 00:43:23,976
I'll put both of my shoes back on!

782
00:43:29,386 --> 00:43:31,647
- IU is going to take the chair for our team.
- Seriously?

783
00:43:31,648 --> 00:43:35,215
[Just as she stated earlier,
IU gets up on the chair.]

784
00:43:35,945 --> 00:43:39,173
- Okay, IU up on the chair.
- Undo your hair tie in case you're submerged.

785
00:43:39,790 --> 00:43:42,555
[That's his idea of cheering her on?]

786
00:43:43,028 --> 00:43:45,979
- You look very pretty, IU!
- Is IU going after the award too?

787
00:43:47,496 --> 00:43:50,169
[It seems as though everyone
is after winning the award.]

788
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:53,484
I-U-I miss you!

789
00:43:55,986 --> 00:43:59,707
[She may be able to hold her breath for
a long time since she's a singer.]

790
00:43:59,708 --> 00:44:02,301
IU, can you howl in melody?

791
00:44:02,302 --> 00:44:04,898
[Can she howl in melody?]

792
00:44:04,899 --> 00:44:07,069
- Can she do it in melody?
- Ready.

793
00:44:08,169 --> 00:44:10,229
[Why are they getting in that pose?]

794
00:44:11,589 --> 00:44:14,503
[Jae Suk's overconfidence in his butt.]

795
00:44:14,504 --> 00:44:17,667
What? I was just
looking at what's in front of me.

796
00:44:17,668 --> 00:44:19,231
What else was I supposed to look at?

797
00:44:19,232 --> 00:44:22,081
I thought you were covering up your eyes,
but you were just touching your forehead.

798
00:44:22,082 --> 00:44:23,694
What about it?

799
00:44:24,833 --> 00:44:26,397
Okay, let's do this.

800
00:44:26,398 --> 00:44:29,196
[Read Team- Start.]

801
00:44:30,988 --> 00:44:34,089
[Even though it's a quite howl,
IU's howling with ease and confidence.]

802
00:44:34,090 --> 00:44:37,177
[Working in sync to gather up
all the stools quickly.]

803
00:44:46,939 --> 00:44:50,829
[IU is already halfway
submerged in the water.]

804
00:44:55,414 --> 00:44:57,175
[Kwang Soo makes it out first.]

805
00:44:57,176 --> 00:44:59,401
[Now only if Jae Suk can
make it back out!]

806
00:44:59,717 --> 00:45:02,320
[Will IU be able to succeed?]

807
00:45:04,272 --> 00:45:05,752
You just need to make it back out!

808
00:45:11,691 --> 00:45:14,047
[She hasn't stopped howling!]

809
00:45:14,048 --> 00:45:17,054
[Red Team comes in at first place!]

810
00:45:18,072 --> 00:45:21,178
[IU gets the job done!]

811
00:45:21,179 --> 00:45:23,334
[Then who will come in at second place?]

812
00:45:23,335 --> 00:45:26,256
- Why don't you give it a try?
- You won't be able to get it done.

813
00:45:26,257 --> 00:45:28,030
- I have to go back in again?
- Hurry up and get up on the chair.

814
00:45:28,743 --> 00:45:32,266
- So I have to get back up there?
- You listen to him very well.

815
00:45:32,267 --> 00:45:34,512
Why do you listen to Jong Kook so well?

816
00:45:34,513 --> 00:45:36,990
[Because Jong Kook is hitting Myung Soo on
the back while pretending to pat him.]

817
00:45:37,661 --> 00:45:39,956
I can't believe how well
you listen to Jong Kook.

818
00:45:39,957 --> 00:45:42,590
- He and I are really close.
- I can't believe how compliant he is.

819
00:45:42,591 --> 00:45:44,312
He's changed a lot.

820
00:45:44,313 --> 00:45:46,302
Gather up all your breath.

821
00:45:48,442 --> 00:45:50,456
[Ha-Myung-Kook, start.]

822
00:45:52,461 --> 00:45:55,996
[Gathering up the stools as quickly as
possible as soon as the whistle sounds.]

823
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:59,452
[Howling as low as he can.]

824
00:46:00,576 --> 00:46:03,342
[The sounds of the stools being gathered
is awfully fast!]

825
00:46:06,169 --> 00:46:08,766
[They may be able to get it done this time!]

826
00:46:11,718 --> 00:46:14,911
[They just need to bring out the stools!]

827
00:46:22,639 --> 00:46:24,367
[Ha-Myung-Kook succeeds!]

828
00:46:29,202 --> 00:46:32,808
[Finishing up his howling like a
creature out of a horror movie.]

829
00:46:33,541 --> 00:46:35,020
We did it.
We did it.

830
00:46:37,394 --> 00:46:39,393
What was that?
A scene from a horror movie?

831
00:46:40,371 --> 00:46:42,989
[They worked together to
succeed the mission.]

832
00:46:42,990 --> 00:46:45,222
[Breaking out into
their celebratory step dance.]

833
00:46:45,223 --> 00:46:47,293
- Do it from up there!
- Do what!

834
00:46:49,249 --> 00:46:51,512
First and second team,
please step up to the front.

835
00:46:51,513 --> 00:46:53,570
[Special information given out to the
two teams that came in first.]

836
00:46:53,571 --> 00:46:58,356
You will be informed of how many wolves
and lambs there are currently.

837
00:46:58,357 --> 00:47:04,092
[Red Team is alerted to the current count
for coming in at first place.]

838
00:47:05,314 --> 00:47:06,861
- Seriously?
- You will be given the same information.

839
00:47:06,862 --> 00:47:09,374
[Wolves- Six; Lambs- Three.]

840
00:47:09,375 --> 00:47:10,968
You're just going to tell us like this?

841
00:47:10,969 --> 00:47:14,874
[On top of knowing the count,
they can also trade in their cards.]

842
00:47:18,391 --> 00:47:21,140
[Kwang Soo's chance to trade in his card.]

843
00:47:22,576 --> 00:47:24,480
By the difference of one single card.

844
00:47:24,481 --> 00:47:26,550
[Quite close to Kwang Soo's current guess.]

845
00:47:28,092 --> 00:47:36,432
[His current lamb card...
gets traded in for the wolf card.]

846
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:40,252
[Jae Suk's estimation.]

847
00:47:47,637 --> 00:47:53,307
[His own wolf card... is kept the same.]

848
00:47:56,250 --> 00:48:00,164
If I just keep the cards as is,
I could win this race.

849
00:48:02,615 --> 00:48:11,014
[Therefore...
IU decided not to trade in her card.]

850
00:48:15,690 --> 00:48:19,001
[Current card after Kwang Soo
trades in his card.]

851
00:48:21,347 --> 00:48:24,784
[The players with the current correct guess.]

852
00:48:25,985 --> 00:48:27,217
Where are we going next?

853
00:48:27,218 --> 00:48:30,187
There are two players with the correct
guess out of the nine of you.

854
00:48:30,188 --> 00:48:32,511
It's possible that the players from
the Red Team may not have made a trade.

855
00:48:32,512 --> 00:48:35,521
- Yeah, you're right.
- They may not have traded in their card.

856
00:48:35,522 --> 00:48:37,681
- That's why it's remaining the same?
- We'll find out at the next game.

857
00:48:37,682 --> 00:48:40,079
Not necessarily. Even if they made a trade,
others could have the correct guess.

858
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:42,134
Did you trade in your card?
What did you do?

859
00:48:44,599 --> 00:48:48,526
[It's difficult to share the information
since this is an individual race...]

860
00:48:50,437 --> 00:48:52,972
We're told to go to Soowon's
Human Resources Center.

861
00:48:53,422 --> 00:48:55,735
Don't you think that we should share
some sort of information?

862
00:48:55,736 --> 00:48:57,915
I feel like we're being too
distrusting of each other.

863
00:48:57,915 --> 00:49:00,907
But I know that you have no intention
of telling us what you have.

864
00:49:01,911 --> 00:49:03,613
[How did he know?]

865
00:49:04,611 --> 00:49:06,416
- That was a lot of gold.
-  I know.

866
00:49:06,417 --> 00:49:08,657
- Do they really give all that out?
- The winner gets it all.

867
00:49:08,940 --> 00:49:10,885
You can take the gold and run.

868
00:49:12,198 --> 00:49:16,094
If I win that gold prize...
don't even come near me, okay?

869
00:49:16,858 --> 00:49:19,652
Don't even look over at me,
or try to talk to me either.

870
00:49:19,653 --> 00:49:21,629
[Everyone seems to be
lusting after the gold.]

871
00:49:22,131 --> 00:49:24,578
I think it's crucial for us
to win this next game.

872
00:49:24,579 --> 00:49:28,955
[Must win the next game in order to gain
an advantage at making the correct guess.]

873
00:49:28,956 --> 00:49:33,970
- Yes, you're right. This is the crucial time.
- It all depends on what the next winner does.

874
00:49:34,825 --> 00:49:40,105
Since the other teams found out the score,
I'm sure they made changes to help them win.

875
00:49:40,106 --> 00:49:42,783
- Yes, you could be right.
- I bet one of them has the right guess.

876
00:49:44,470 --> 00:49:47,491
[Arriving at the next mission location.]

877
00:49:48,149 --> 00:49:50,276
- Isn't that the UFC...
- What's that?

878
00:49:50,277 --> 00:49:51,860
That really is the UFC ring.

879
00:49:52,453 --> 00:49:55,340
[Soowon Human Resources
Development Center.]

880
00:49:58,781 --> 00:50:02,198
[A little unsure of it from the distance...]

881
00:50:02,199 --> 00:50:04,587
[But it really is the octagonal ring!]

882
00:50:04,588 --> 00:50:06,072
What is this?

883
00:50:07,834 --> 00:50:09,452
What are you doing to us?

884
00:50:10,153 --> 00:50:12,067
- What do you think you're doing?
- What is this all about?

885
00:50:12,068 --> 00:50:14,521
Don't you think that you're being too
harsh with IU on our team?

886
00:50:15,041 --> 00:50:18,323
How could you have set up a ring like this
with Jong Kook on the other team?

887
00:50:19,282 --> 00:50:20,880
[This truly is...]

888
00:50:22,886 --> 00:50:26,765
[The octagonal ring where the
UFC battles are fought in.]

889
00:50:29,345 --> 00:50:32,149
[That hellish ring is now standing
right in front of their eyes.]

890
00:50:32,150 --> 00:50:37,655
[What is that ring doing here
in front of them?]

891
00:50:37,656 --> 00:50:39,749
We're peaceful people.

892
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:43,768
We're not going to be playing name tag
elimination in there, are we?

893
00:50:43,769 --> 00:50:46,014
You have to give us a chance to escape!

894
00:50:46,015 --> 00:50:48,168
What are you trying to do to us?

895
00:50:48,825 --> 00:50:52,167
- Are you trying to get us killed?
- Are we going to battle it out?

896
00:50:53,127 --> 00:50:54,843
[This is what I've been waiting for.]

897
00:50:56,394 --> 00:50:58,302
It's finally time to battle it out.

898
00:50:58,303 --> 00:51:01,226
Hey, look at the fear in IU's eyes.

899
00:51:02,126 --> 00:51:04,314
Myung Soo is going to take on IU.

900
00:51:04,315 --> 00:51:06,804
- He's going to take IU down.
- It's the octagon!

901
00:51:08,055 --> 00:51:10,251
[Even the random Mr. Capable
seems to light up at the sight?]

902
00:51:12,591 --> 00:51:14,945
[Even breaking out into a dance of
confidence at the sight of the ring?]

903
00:51:15,733 --> 00:51:18,504
- That ring looks so official.
- Seriously...

904
00:51:18,505 --> 00:51:22,030
I'm seriously going to kick your butt
if you and I get in that ring together.

905
00:51:22,031 --> 00:51:23,096
Jae Suk.

906
00:51:24,388 --> 00:51:27,370
Can we just have a personal match in there?
Can you allow us to do that?

907
00:51:27,371 --> 00:51:28,839
I'm serious.

908
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:31,509
[You want to do this?
Seriously?]

909
00:51:31,929 --> 00:51:34,872
[In moments...]

910
00:51:34,873 --> 00:51:38,103
[You will witness a bloody end
to their feud?]

911
00:51:38,104 --> 00:51:39,341
<i>Okay, here's your mission.</i>

912
00:51:39,342 --> 00:51:41,224
<i>As you can see in front of you</i>

913
00:51:41,225 --> 00:51:44,053
<i>your third mission will be name tag
elimination in the octagonal ring.</i>

914
00:51:44,054 --> 00:51:45,734
- What?
- A name tag elimination?

915
00:51:45,735 --> 00:51:49,416
<i>As you're all already aware,
there are three of you in each team.</i>

916
00:51:49,417 --> 00:51:52,482
- This game is for Jong Kook.
- One player per team must come into the ring.

917
00:51:52,483 --> 00:51:56,557
<i>It will be a one-on-one-on-one face-off
between the three players in the ring.</i>

918
00:51:56,558 --> 00:52:01,336
<i>However, you won't know who will come
into the ring for the battle from other teams.</i>

919
00:52:01,337 --> 00:52:05,763
<i>You will not be allowed to watch the other
teams discussing who will go into the ring.</i>

920
00:52:05,764 --> 00:52:10,206
[The main point of the competition is that
they won't know who they'll be facing.]

921
00:52:10,207 --> 00:52:11,838
This is all about the luck of the draw.

922
00:52:11,839 --> 00:52:15,167
<i>First and second place winners will
be notified of what the current count is.</i>

923
00:52:15,168 --> 00:52:17,244
<i>And for the team that comes in
at first place...</i>

924
00:52:17,646 --> 00:52:19,619
<i>That team will also be given a chance
to trade in their cards for a different one.</i>

925
00:52:19,620 --> 00:52:21,978
Will it still be a normal game even if
IU enters the ring?

926
00:52:21,979 --> 00:52:24,090
Yes, of course. It doesn't
matter who enters the ring.

927
00:52:24,091 --> 00:52:26,342
- Why would you even ask that question?
- Seriously?

928
00:52:26,343 --> 00:52:28,442
- I'll be waiting for you.
- He says he'll be waiting.

929
00:52:31,551 --> 00:52:33,215
The best case scenario for us would be...

930
00:52:33,216 --> 00:52:37,174
if Jong Kook and Gary ended up
going up against each other.

931
00:52:37,175 --> 00:52:39,104
It would be best for us if they ended up
being in the ring together.

932
00:52:39,105 --> 00:52:41,965
Even though I feel a bit bad about this...

933
00:52:42,430 --> 00:52:44,189
For the sake of our team...

934
00:52:44,190 --> 00:52:47,267
- If IU went up against them...
- Jong Kook is weak when it comes to women.

935
00:52:47,268 --> 00:52:49,697
He'll never get rough with women.

936
00:52:50,031 --> 00:52:52,841
I think I can take Suk Jin down.

937
00:52:54,510 --> 00:52:56,585
Try grabbing me.
Let's do a little role play.

938
00:52:56,586 --> 00:52:58,501
Put some strength behind it.

939
00:53:04,525 --> 00:53:06,547
I feel like you're really going to hit me.

940
00:53:06,548 --> 00:53:10,294
The main thing is that we won't know
who's going to enter in that ring.

941
00:53:10,295 --> 00:53:12,808
- That's the crucial part.
- That's what's important. The decision...

942
00:53:13,810 --> 00:53:16,904
[Just who will the teams send into the
ring as their first players?]

943
00:53:16,905 --> 00:53:18,751
I'll take IU down.

944
00:53:26,901 --> 00:53:28,924
Ready.
One!

945
00:53:30,062 --> 00:53:31,184
Two!

946
00:53:32,474 --> 00:53:33,753
Three!
Enter!

947
00:53:33,754 --> 00:53:36,411
[Round One- Start.]

948
00:53:36,412 --> 00:53:42,645
[First player for each team...]

949
00:53:48,174 --> 00:53:51,533
[White Team- Myung Soo.]

950
00:53:51,534 --> 00:53:54,145
[Red Team- Traitorous Kwang Soo.]

951
00:53:54,146 --> 00:53:56,692
[Blue Team- Boxer Gae.]

952
00:53:57,665 --> 00:54:00,637
[This is going to be entertaining!]

953
00:54:00,638 --> 00:54:03,101
- Kwang Soo.
- You can win this, Kwang Soo.

954
00:54:05,929 --> 00:54:07,165
Myung Soo, team up with Gary first.

955
00:54:07,166 --> 00:54:09,499
[High fiving each other?]

956
00:54:10,804 --> 00:54:13,279
[Myung Soo and Gary
teaming up immediately.]

957
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:14,758
It's okay, you can do it.

958
00:54:14,759 --> 00:54:16,519
[Attack]

959
00:54:17,245 --> 00:54:18,844
Just hold still!
Why do you keep spinning around?

960
00:54:20,510 --> 00:54:21,820
Stop doing that!

961
00:54:22,583 --> 00:54:24,898
[Prepare yourself, Giraffe.]

962
00:54:27,699 --> 00:54:29,250
What are you doing?

963
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:35,028
Stop it!
You're giving me a headache!

964
00:54:38,370 --> 00:54:41,747
[The three players circling around each other
to look for their chance at an attack.]

965
00:54:45,023 --> 00:54:46,715
- You're not going to rip off my tag, are you?
- No, I won't.

966
00:54:49,875 --> 00:54:52,407
[A sneak attack!]

967
00:54:55,459 --> 00:54:59,090
[Giraffe in danger!]

968
00:55:05,811 --> 00:55:09,387
[Giraffe quickly escapes harm's way
only to be attacked again!]

969
00:55:11,161 --> 00:55:14,177
[Holds onto Park-Perm with his long arm.]

970
00:55:14,178 --> 00:55:16,423
[Huh?]

971
00:55:17,773 --> 00:55:19,676
[Myung Soo- Out!]

972
00:55:20,642 --> 00:55:23,585
[While being dragged around...]

973
00:55:23,586 --> 00:55:26,653
[His name tag gets ripped off
in the process.]

974
00:55:29,211 --> 00:55:31,309
[Utter humiliation.]

975
00:55:32,626 --> 00:55:34,959
[Ousted before he could
even do anything.]

976
00:55:40,438 --> 00:55:42,231
Is that any way to treat your elder?

977
00:55:45,217 --> 00:55:48,075
What are you doing?
I told you not to get ousted!

978
00:55:49,463 --> 00:55:51,705
- I've never done this before!
- Just get out here!

979
00:55:53,969 --> 00:55:58,408
Gary's no easy opponent.
Gary is really good.

980
00:55:58,409 --> 00:56:01,246
[Long arms vs. the Boxer.]

981
00:56:01,247 --> 00:56:03,308
I never would've even fathomed that
Gary would be the first player out.

982
00:56:03,309 --> 00:56:05,540
We have to get at least second place.

983
00:56:05,541 --> 00:56:07,973
His arms are so long!

984
00:56:14,275 --> 00:56:17,688
[Giraffe attacks first...]

985
00:56:17,689 --> 00:56:20,381
[And Gary counterattacks!]

986
00:56:20,382 --> 00:56:23,667
[Who will be the first to get eliminated?]

987
00:56:29,695 --> 00:56:34,068
[Lays himself on the ground...]

988
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:43,506
[Gary wins!]

989
00:56:43,507 --> 00:56:45,453
Wow, Kwang Soo was doing so well.

990
00:56:45,454 --> 00:56:47,824
- We did it!
- I want you, Kang Gary!

991
00:56:47,825 --> 00:56:49,931
I want you, Kang Gary!

992
00:56:53,285 --> 00:56:56,310
[I'm the random Mr. Capable.]

993
00:56:58,188 --> 00:57:01,709
[Just like the UFC champion,
Kim Dong Hyun...]

994
00:57:02,913 --> 00:57:05,439
[Ecstatic Boxer Gae.]

995
00:57:07,385 --> 00:57:10,427
[The joy over their first success.]

996
00:57:12,481 --> 00:57:14,207
Kwang Soo got to him first though.

997
00:57:16,281 --> 00:57:17,542
That was awesome.

998
00:57:18,423 --> 00:57:21,326
- You were awesome, Kang Gary.
- That's just how I usually am.

999
00:57:21,327 --> 00:57:23,977
[You really are...]

1000
00:57:24,650 --> 00:57:28,597
Second players for Round Two,
please stand in front of your entrance.

1001
00:57:29,323 --> 00:57:31,915
[Yoo Hyuk awaits to enter the ring.]

1002
00:57:33,159 --> 00:57:34,304
Two.

1003
00:57:34,756 --> 00:57:37,749
[Just who will enter the ring
as the second players?]

1004
00:57:49,715 --> 00:57:53,496
[It's me!]

1005
00:57:59,641 --> 00:58:03,357
[I'm ruined!]

1006
00:58:03,358 --> 00:58:04,727
We've got this!

1007
00:58:06,044 --> 00:58:11,543
[White Team's plan was to enter the ring
in the order of their age.]

1008
00:58:11,544 --> 00:58:13,340
Then you could go in second.

1009
00:58:17,278 --> 00:58:19,779
[Their simple plan seems to be
working out great for them.]

1010
00:58:19,780 --> 00:58:21,641
Why don't you two
go up against each other first?

1011
00:58:21,642 --> 00:58:24,111
What are you talking about?

1012
00:58:25,776 --> 00:58:28,280
- What are you saying right now?
- Watch your back.

1013
00:58:28,722 --> 00:58:31,938
[This is none other than the Tiger's den.]

1014
00:58:31,939 --> 00:58:34,764
- Those two aren't going to be any challenge.
- You're going to get yourself ousted first.

1015
00:58:35,218 --> 00:58:36,870
- You're going to get yourself ousted first.
- Jong Kook.

1016
00:58:36,871 --> 00:58:39,114
What's going on?
What are you doing in there?

1017
00:58:39,940 --> 00:58:42,064
[Trips and falls back
while walking backwards.]

1018
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:44,638
[That could've been big trouble.]

1019
00:58:45,730 --> 00:58:47,390
You have to beat them, Suk Jin.

1020
00:58:47,900 --> 00:58:51,626
- What are you trying to do over there?
- Just come in second, Suk Jin.

1021
00:58:51,627 --> 00:58:53,189
Second place would be better, right?

1022
00:58:53,190 --> 00:58:56,253
[It would actually better for them to
come in at second place...]

1023
00:58:56,254 --> 00:58:59,310
[In that case...]

1024
00:58:59,311 --> 00:59:00,478
Okay.

1025
00:59:00,479 --> 00:59:02,122
- I'm serious.
- I'm serious too.

1026
00:59:03,695 --> 00:59:05,845
- That's not fair.
- You're going to get yourself ousted!

1027
00:59:06,295 --> 00:59:09,022
[In a blink of an eye,
the Tiger and Impala joins forces.]

1028
00:59:11,180 --> 00:59:13,473
[Red Grasshopper backed up into a corner.]

1029
00:59:13,474 --> 00:59:14,842
Rip off Jae Suk's name tag.

1030
00:59:16,211 --> 00:59:17,941
[No!]

1031
00:59:20,028 --> 00:59:22,468
- Aren't you going to rip it off?
- You could be the one getting ousted first.

1032
00:59:23,434 --> 00:59:25,065
[I can't hear you!]

1033
00:59:25,894 --> 00:59:27,242
Suk Jin!

1034
00:59:28,576 --> 00:59:31,298
[Cruel takedown of the Grasshopper...]

1035
00:59:31,299 --> 00:59:32,688
Please stop!

1036
00:59:32,689 --> 00:59:35,094
Please stop torturing Jae Suk!

1037
00:59:35,849 --> 00:59:37,898
What's taking you so long?

1038
00:59:37,899 --> 00:59:39,555
I'm going to tie him up.

1039
00:59:46,763 --> 00:59:50,038
[Huh?]

1040

[However...]

1044
01:00:10,389 --> 01:00:13,000
[The Tiger ultimately ends the hunt.]

1045
01:00:15,385 --> 01:00:17,131
You can do it, Suk Jin!

1046
01:00:18,592 --> 01:00:20,689
I only wanted to come in at
second place anyways.

1047
01:00:20,690 --> 01:00:22,384
There you go.

1048
01:00:23,387 --> 01:00:26,651

[October, 20th, 2013-
The ultimate humiliation...]

I can't keep watching this
without crying.

1052

Jae Suk.

1053
01:00:42,204 --> 01:00:43,994
- This humiliation...
- You did great.

1054
01:00:43,995 --> 01:00:45,964
- I will get revenge for this humiliation.
- No, you did fine.

1055

[I won't forget this utter humiliation.]

1056
01:00:51,047 --> 01:00:53,394
Wow, he really tied you up tight.

1057
01:00:53,395 --> 01:00:55,471
How could he have tied you up
so tightly like that?

1058
01:00:55,472 --> 01:00:57,387
Do you really think that this
was necessary?

1059
01:00:57,388 --> 01:00:58,616
Look at what he did to me.

1060
01:01:03,046 --> 01:01:05,449
[Tiger has Impala's hands locked up
in his vise-like grip.]

1061
01:01:05,450 --> 01:01:07,173
Hang on a second.
Are you trying to take my shirt off?

1062
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:09,845
Suk Jin.

1063
01:01:12,351 --> 01:01:14,044
That was a UFC move.

1064
01:01:14,045 --> 01:01:15,812
I feel like I'm watching a UFC match.

1065
01:01:15,813 --> 01:01:18,618

- This is no amateur match.

1066

[Tiger launching into his attack
once again.]

01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:28,543
Come back here!
It's you and me!

1069
01:01:30,974 --> 01:01:33,622
Stop tormenting Suk Jin!
Just kill him and put him out of his misery.

1070
01:01:34,030 --> 01:01:36,784
- You're a monster!
- Stop torturing our Suk Jin!

1071
01:01:38,312 --> 01:01:40,510
What is he trying to do to Suk Jin?

1072
01:01:40,511 --> 01:01:42,625
His grips are no different than
being handcuffed.

1073
01:01:42,626 --> 01:01:45,042
Stop torturing our Suk Jin!

1074
01:01:47,451 --> 01:01:49,928
- What the heck is this?
- He really has sunken to an all-time low.

1075

[This is what you call a miserable end...]

1076

01:06:17,075 --> 01:06:19,885
So it'll either be Jong Kook or
Myung Soo from the White Team this time.

1131
01:06:19,886 --> 01:06:21,052
That's right.

1132
01:06:25,979 --> 01:06:28,020
[You can't be thinking...]

1133
01:06:28,021 --> 01:06:33,181
[The player from their most recent battle?]

1134
01:06:34,336 --> 01:06:36,796
We have no other choice but to use
our most secret weapon.

1135
01:06:36,797 --> 01:06:38,299
And I'm your ultimate weapon?

1136
01:06:38,300 --> 01:06:40,372
I think our team is just too weak.

1137
01:06:42,774 --> 01:06:45,590
[Miss Ultimate Weapon...
Please take care our biggest opponents.]

1138
01:06:46,294 --> 01:06:48,928
[Time for the players to enter the ring.]

1139
01:06:55,304 --> 01:06:57,649
[Myung Soo]

1140
01:06:57,650 --> 01:06:59,264
[Suk Jin]

1141
01:06:59,265 --> 01:07:01,333
[IU]

1142
01:07:01,334 --> 01:07:04,789
[All three players are totally unexpected.]

1143
01:07:04,790 --> 01:07:06,273
They sent IU in thinking that
I was going to enter that ring.

1144
01:07:06,274 --> 01:07:08,899
- You can't betray us, IU.
- You have to eliminate Suk Jin first.

1145
01:07:08,900 --> 01:07:13,113
[Going after the Blue Team who has the
highest chances of winning the game.]

1146
01:07:13,749 --> 01:07:16,911
[Launching their joint attack..]

1147
01:07:17,714 --> 01:07:19,563
You're being tricked right now, IU.

1148
01:07:20,122 --> 01:07:21,873
[Enough!]

1149
01:07:27,998 --> 01:07:31,078
[Hits himself in the process.]

1150
01:07:38,881 --> 01:07:41,374
[An emergency self-treatment?]

1151
01:07:41,375 --> 01:07:43,742
Hey, you have to think about this, IU.

1152
01:07:43,743 --> 01:07:45,756
You can't let the Blue Team win.
You and Myung Soo has to get Suk Jin.

1153
01:07:45,757 --> 01:07:47,719
You have to be more careful, Myung Soo.

1154
01:07:48,379 --> 01:07:50,029
You have to grab his arms!

1155
01:07:50,030 --> 01:07:52,075
[Blindly launches into his attack.]

1156
01:07:53,013 --> 01:07:56,068
[Frontal face-off between the two
middle aged men?]

1157
01:08:01,428 --> 01:08:02,567
Rip it off right now!

1158
01:08:04,560 --> 01:08:07,976
[Suk Jin eliminates Myung Soo's name tag!]

1159
01:08:09,409 --> 01:08:11,890
What are you doing back there, IU?
I just got eliminated.

1160
01:08:13,029 --> 01:08:16,137
[Myung Soo- Out!]

1161
01:08:17,556 --> 01:08:19,418
I had no idea that he could do that.

1162
01:08:19,419 --> 01:08:22,546
[After three years on Running Man, even
Big-nosed Brother can handle this much?]

1163
01:08:22,547 --> 01:08:24,661
I was holding onto him so that
you could eliminate him.

1164
01:08:24,662 --> 01:08:27,211
What do you mean,
you were holding him down?

1165
01:08:30,129 --> 01:08:31,486
[Just then!]

1166
01:08:31,487 --> 01:08:35,807
[IU sees her chance and attacks!]

1167
01:08:37,425 --> 01:08:40,139
[He even manages to immediately
position himself in a defensive position!]

1168
01:08:41,540 --> 01:08:42,680
IU.

1169
01:08:42,681 --> 01:08:43,718
Hang on a minute.

1170
01:08:43,719 --> 01:08:46,173
If you'd sing for me in high octave,
then I won't eliminate you.

1171
01:08:50,597 --> 01:08:52,543
[Giraffe's helping hand?]

1172
01:08:55,046 --> 01:08:57,726
[Big-nosed Brother in danger!]

1173
01:08:58,415 --> 01:08:59,800
Hey!
What are you doing?

1174
01:09:00,470 --> 01:09:02,662
- What are you doing?
- Rip it off, IU!

1175
01:09:05,492 --> 01:09:08,393
[Big-nosed Brother- Out!]

1176
01:09:09,696 --> 01:09:12,220
You can't do that!
That's cheating!

1177
01:09:12,221 --> 01:09:13,615
No one told him to stand there.

1178
01:09:13,616 --> 01:09:15,060
We did it!

1179
01:09:16,351 --> 01:09:20,550
[Will his elimination be accepted?]

1180
01:09:20,551 --> 01:09:23,931
<i>As a continuation from last week,
the WWF regulations...</i>

1181
01:09:23,932 --> 01:09:27,893
[WWF regulations can be used, and accepted.]

1182
01:09:27,894 --> 01:09:29,962
I can't believe this!

1183
01:09:30,517 --> 01:09:32,764
[Unbelievable...]

1184
01:09:34,451 --> 01:09:37,153
[Miss Ultimate Weapon!
IU wins!]

1185
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:41,300
- You really did great.
- You did more than your share of work.

1186
01:09:41,301 --> 01:09:43,190
[Red Team finally earns themselves a point
all thanks to IU's hard work.]

1187
01:09:43,191 --> 01:09:45,243
- No, please don't mention it.
- If it hadn't been for you...

1188
01:09:45,243 --> 01:09:47,938
The two of us wouldn't even have a chance
if it weren't for you.

1189
01:09:51,132 --> 01:09:54,037
[Since IU did more than her portion,
next one up will now be...]

1190
01:09:54,038 --> 01:09:55,250
Okay, I'll try my best.

1191
01:09:55,251 --> 01:09:56,571
- I'll try my best.
- Do your best.

1192
01:09:56,572 --> 01:09:59,167
It's all over if the Blue Team wins.
We have no other choice.

1193
01:10:04,085 --> 01:10:05,954
Feel the rage from within.

1194
01:10:07,364 --> 01:10:09,283
In the event that Jong Kook comes out,
we need her to go out there.

1195
01:10:09,283 --> 01:10:11,447
[Blue Team is feeling the pressure.]

1196
01:10:11,448 --> 01:10:12,956
You think that would be better?

1197
01:10:13,485 --> 01:10:16,730
[Will it be the Tiger that steps into
the den from the White Team?]

1198
01:10:17,447 --> 01:10:18,496
Three.

1199
01:10:19,273 --> 01:10:20,340
Two.

1200
01:10:20,918 --> 01:10:22,363
One.
Enter!

1201
01:10:24,826 --> 01:10:26,484
It's Ji Hyo.
I knew it.

1202
01:10:27,877 --> 01:10:29,561
It's Ji Hyo.
I knew it.

1203
01:10:32,801 --> 01:10:34,348
Hurry up and help me, Ji Hyo!

1204
01:10:38,883 --> 01:10:40,957
[Blank Ji is helping protect Ro-Ro.]

1205
01:10:40,958 --> 01:10:42,676
Kwang Soo!

1206
01:10:43,382 --> 01:10:45,736
[Kwang Soo having been backed up
into a corner in the blink of an eye!]

1207
01:10:54,638 --> 01:10:57,417
[Throws Ro-Ro's name tag into the wind.]

1208
01:10:58,916 --> 01:11:01,865
[Ha Ha- Out!]

1209
01:11:02,766 --> 01:11:03,871
Ji Hyo!

1210
01:11:04,077 --> 01:11:07,736
[But Ace Ji Hyo still has the Giraffe's
name tag in her grasp!]

1211
01:11:08,302 --> 01:11:10,538
[You're doing great!]

1212
01:11:10,539 --> 01:11:12,421
[Please, Kwang Soo!]

1213
01:11:17,731 --> 01:11:19,043
There you go!

1214
01:11:19,044 --> 01:11:22,226
[Delinquent Ji Hyo rears her ugly head.]

1215
01:11:22,227 --> 01:11:24,358
Great job, Ji Hyo!
You're doing great, Song Ji Hyo!

1216
01:11:24,359 --> 01:11:25,980
Use both hands.

1217
01:11:25,981 --> 01:11:27,707
No, you can't have it!

1218
01:11:28,949 --> 01:11:31,346
Why does that look so familiar,
and why am I reminded of myself?

1219
01:11:33,911 --> 01:11:35,308
Daddy!

1220
01:11:35,309 --> 01:11:37,236
Daddy!
Look at what she's doing to me again!

1221
01:11:37,237 --> 01:11:38,802
Daddy!

1222
01:11:38,803 --> 01:11:41,060
Just end him right now.
There you go! Step on it!

1223
01:11:41,061 --> 01:11:42,319
[Steps on his half detached
name tag with her foot.]

1224
01:11:42,320 --> 01:11:44,153
I feel like I'm watching a
real UFC match.

1225
01:11:47,148 --> 01:11:49,672
[All she has to do now is to grab the
name tag and rip it off his back!]

1226
01:11:53,543 --> 01:11:55,872
[Kwang Soo's desperate escape!]

1227
01:11:57,023 --> 01:12:00,109
[But he didn't get very far, did he?]

1228
01:12:03,085 --> 01:12:06,070
[Save a Giraffe's life!]

1229
01:12:06,878 --> 01:12:09,396
[Why don't you go run off
and tell your daddy?]

1230
01:12:16,587 --> 01:12:20,247
[Angry Blank wins!]

1231
01:12:20,248 --> 01:12:23,675
Song Ji Hyo!
Song Ji Hyo!

1232
01:12:23,676 --> 01:12:26,896
And thus, the Blue Team wins!

1233
01:12:26,897 --> 01:12:30,699
[Blue Team wins first place
for Octagon name tag elimination!]

1234
01:12:30,700 --> 01:12:32,325
Wow, Song Ji Hyo...

1235
01:12:33,086 --> 01:12:37,409
<i>The first place winner has now been determined
but we have to decide the second place winner.</i>

1236
01:12:37,410 --> 01:12:39,379
Okay, Kim Jong Kook is going to
enter the ring.

1237
01:12:40,468 --> 01:12:44,995
<i>The last remaining players from the White
and Red Teams will enter on three.</i>

1238
01:12:46,135 --> 01:12:47,772
- Okay, players, enter!
- Fighting.

1239
01:13:02,282 --> 01:13:05,214
[Barely managing to keep himself calm.]

1240
01:13:05,215 --> 01:13:07,861
- Okay. Are you ready?
- Ready.

1241
01:13:08,469 --> 01:13:10,305
[The beast.]

1242
01:13:10,306 --> 01:13:13,245
[vs. the Red Grasshopper.]

1243
01:13:14,722 --> 01:13:18,292
Feel the rage!
Feel the rage from within!

1244
01:13:18,293 --> 01:13:20,322
- This is the last round!
- Hey, Judge!

1245
01:13:20,323 --> 01:13:23,922
I don't like the look on the Red Team's face.
I don't think they're up to any good.

1246
01:13:24,769 --> 01:13:26,938
[There's no way that he could have
a happy expression on his face right now.]

1247
01:13:26,939 --> 01:13:28,648
That's just what he normally looks like.

1248
01:13:31,156 --> 01:13:32,759
He's trying to end this quickly.

1249
01:13:37,336 --> 01:13:39,750
[Plan is to lure him into Giraffe's grasp.]

1250
01:13:39,751 --> 01:13:40,818
Come over here.

1251
01:13:40,819 --> 01:13:42,566
- Come on.
- What is this?

1252
01:13:42,567 --> 01:13:44,308
Look at him.
He looks like a freaky monster.

1253
01:13:49,936 --> 01:13:51,476
Just pull the Giraffe down
from his perch.

1254
01:13:54,172 --> 01:13:57,239
Use Kwang Soo to knock Jae Suk out,
and use him as your tool.

1255
01:13:58,224 --> 01:14:00,046
- Am I allowed to do that?
- You can't do that!

1256
01:14:03,760 --> 01:14:07,421
[Yoo-ruce Willis' surprise attack!]

1257
01:14:08,501 --> 01:14:10,183
[In the blink of an eye while
Mr. Capable let down his guard!]

1258
01:14:10,184 --> 01:14:12,386
[I got you!]

1259
01:14:25,050 --> 01:14:27,250
[Ah... ambush attack failed.]

1260
01:14:27,251 --> 01:14:29,922
[But he still manages to throw
the Tiger off his balance.]

1261
01:14:34,074 --> 01:14:35,357
You almost got me.

1262
01:14:37,095 --> 01:14:41,039
[The game could be over if it hadn't been
for the Tiger's quick reflexes.]

1263
01:14:41,040 --> 01:14:42,615
[This Tiger is angry for real!]

1264
01:14:49,314 --> 01:14:51,576
[The Giraffe has been bothering him
for long enough now.]

1265
01:14:51,577 --> 01:14:53,346
What are you trying to do?

1266
01:14:53,347 --> 01:14:55,008
What are you doing?
Why are you grabbing him?

1267
01:14:57,132 --> 01:14:59,156
What are you doing!

1268
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:02,635
[First thing first.
Get rid of the bothersome Giraffe.]

1269
01:15:04,703 --> 01:15:06,326
- What are you doing?
- What about it?

1270
01:15:09,010 --> 01:15:11,820
- What are you doing?
- You guys are trying to cheat!

1271
01:15:11,855 --> 01:15:14,510
Seriously... what do you think
you're doing?

1272
01:15:14,511 --> 01:15:17,136
[Just when the Giraffe has everyone
somewhat distracted...]

1273
01:15:18,958 --> 01:15:21,695
[Pulls Jae Suk out onto
the middle of the ring.]

1274
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:23,972
You know what's about to happen, Jae Suk.

1275
01:15:23,973 --> 01:15:25,607
It's all over now.

1276
01:15:25,608 --> 01:15:28,964
- Don't make it worse than it has to be.
- Lean off to the side.

1277
01:15:29,246 --> 01:15:31,269
- Come here, Jae Suk.
- Okay, Kwang Soo.

1278
01:15:31,270 --> 01:15:33,871
Do you really think that I can drag him all
the way there Kwang Soo?

1279
01:15:34,232 --> 01:15:36,066
You know that's pretty much impossible.

1280
01:15:37,072 --> 01:15:39,781
[Let's just end this now.]

1281
01:15:42,633 --> 01:15:44,865
[Oh... a pretty tight competition?]

1282
01:15:48,498 --> 01:15:51,131
[Strength vs. Strength]

1283
01:15:54,450 --> 01:15:57,300
[A true face-off!]

1284
01:15:57,852 --> 01:16:01,372
[An eminent end is near!]

1285
01:16:06,728 --> 01:16:09,410
[I won't let you beat me!]

1286
01:16:15,371 --> 01:16:18,136
[Mr. Capable wins!]

1287
01:16:19,115 --> 01:16:20,706
- We did it!
- Yeah!

1288
01:16:20,707 --> 01:16:22,488
You almost had him.

1289
01:16:22,489 --> 01:16:25,052
[He was so close to getting him!]

1290
01:16:25,053 --> 01:16:27,616
- The tag was almost off his back.
- You did good, Jae Suk.

1291
01:16:27,617 --> 01:16:29,248
I just needed a little more.

1292
01:16:32,774 --> 01:16:34,410
<i>This is the current count of the
wolf cards vs. the lamb cards.</i>

1293
01:16:34,411 --> 01:16:36,926
- You can take this.
- It's possible that nothing's changed.

1294
01:16:36,927 --> 01:16:40,197
<i>You may take this and go to the voting booth

[The Blue Team wins the final chance
to trade in their cards one last time.]

1296
01:16:41,956 --> 01:16:43,716
Okay, second place winner.
The White Team.

1297
01:16:43,997 --> 01:16:46,457
- Let's all take a look.
- Here you go.

1298
01:16:46,458 --> 01:16:50,334
[White Team also gets the current count
from having come in at second place.]

1299
01:16:50,335 --> 01:16:51,985
What have you done today?

1300
01:16:53,310 --> 01:16:55,300
<i>Don't let the others see it.</i>

1301
01:16:56,447 --> 01:16:59,393
[The current count-
Seven wolves vs. two lambs.]

1302
01:16:59,394 --> 01:17:02,485
[Just what...]

1303
01:17:02,486 --> 01:17:07,035
[Will the Blue Team members
trade in their cards?]

1304
01:17:08,527 --> 01:17:11,253
[Off to the final location.]

1305
01:17:11,539 --> 01:17:13,487
We have no idea who the winner
is going to be yet.

1306
01:17:13,488 --> 01:17:16,925
- It's possible that we could still win.
- Yes, that's still possible.

1307
01:17:16,926 --> 01:17:20,755
[The result will depend on whether or not
the Blue Team members will make a trade.]

1308
01:17:20,756 --> 01:17:22,062
We just need to match up the numbers.

1309
01:17:25,007 --> 01:17:30,864
[The fate between
the wolves and the lambs.]

1310
01:17:34,380 --> 01:17:37,103
The current score right now is
seven wolves and two lambs.

1311
01:17:38,109 --> 01:17:40,619
I have a feeling that the Blue Team
traded in their cards.

1312
01:17:46,343 --> 01:17:50,451
[Just how will the story of
the wolves and the lambs end?]

[Diving boards!]

1315
01:18:20,746 --> 01:18:23,253
- We have to climb up there?
- Everyone, watch your step.

1316
01:18:25,369 --> 01:18:28,373
[Completely befuddled.]

1317
01:18:29,389 --> 01:18:31,115
Wow, this is no joke!

1318
01:18:31,116 --> 01:18:32,669
- What is this?
- This is no joke!

1319
01:18:32,670 --> 01:18:34,033
- What is all this?
- What the heck is this?

[Nine diving boards ready for their divers.]

1322
01:18:41,213 --> 01:18:42,919
Is there anything that you guys
won't do anymore?

1323
01:18:44,114 --> 01:18:47,157
- What is all this?
- This isn't even right.

1324
01:18:47,917 --> 01:18:51,425
<i>I need everyone to stand in front of
their names on the screens.</i>

1325
01:18:52,092 --> 01:18:54,712
<i>Thanks to everyone
for all your hard work today.</i>

1326

the final results.</i>

[Standings of the wolf and the lamb card
count during the opening of the show.]

1328
01:19:08,202 --> 01:19:12,099
<i>Okay, everyone needs to hold your card
with your guess close to your chest.</i>

1329
01:19:12,593 --> 01:19:14,660
<i>Everyone needs to step out
to the front of the diving boards.</i>

1330
01:19:14,661 --> 01:19:17,766
[Step up to the front of the diving boards
with their cards held to their chests.]

1331
01:19:19,059 --> 01:19:22,324
[As predicted, fearless Blank Ji is already
standing at the edge of the board.]

1332
01:19:22,815 --> 01:19:24,693
<i>You have to stand at the edge
of the diving board.</i>

1333
01:19:28,187 --> 01:19:30,841
<i>Do you all see Song Ji Hyo at the edge
of her diving board?</i>

1334
01:19:31,701 --> 01:19:35,718
<i>Everyone needs to stand at the edge like
Song Ji Hyo is doing. Come on, men!</i>

1335
01:19:37,355 --> 01:19:40,275
<i>Everyone needs to stand at the edge like
Song Ji Hyo is doing. Come on, men!</i>

1336
01:19:40,276 --> 01:19:44,544
[Phobia of heights rearing its ugly head
at a 3m diving board.]

1337
01:19:44,545 --> 01:19:46,639
<i>I promise that the diving boards
will not crumble under your feet.</i>

1338
01:19:46,640 --> 01:19:48,694
[What's wrong with all these guys?]

1339
01:19:48,695 --> 01:19:50,423
<i>Okay, please follow Song Ji Hyo's lead.</i>

1340
01:19:50,798 --> 01:19:54,624
[Finally... they all start to tiptoe
carefully to the ledge, one by one.]

1341
01:19:54,625 --> 01:19:56,956
<i>Please come up to the edge of
your diving boards right now.</i>

1342
01:19:56,957 --> 01:19:58,266
This is really scary.

1343
01:19:58,267 --> 01:20:01,534
<i>The diving boards will not
give out on you.</i>

1344
01:20:03,160 --> 01:20:05,474
<i>Everyone just needs to stand in their
place like Song Ji Hyo's is doing.</i>

1345
01:20:05,475 --> 01:20:07,550
[Moving at a pace that's slower
than a turtle's.]

1346

<i>Ji Suk Jin?</i>

1347

gathers up his courage to step forward.]

a conclusive result of the race.</i>

1350

<i>The person who guessed correctly
will win the gold bars as their prize.</i>

1351
01:20:24,425 --> 01:20:28,667
<i>And those of you who got it wrong
will probably go for a quick dip in the pool.</i>

1352

1353

<i>and showing the camera which
of the two cards he has chosen.</i>

1354
01:20:34,517 --> 01:20:36,114
Wolf.

1355
01:20:37,288 --> 01:20:39,707
Unbelievably enough,
my zodiac sign is that of a lamb.

1356
01:20:39,708 --> 01:20:41,857
[Ha Ha's original pick had been the lamb.]

1357
01:20:43,086 --> 01:20:45,798
[He swaps it out for the wolf.]

1358
01:20:46,210 --> 01:20:47,769
<i>Okay, Kim Jong Kook.</i>

1359
01:20:47,770 --> 01:20:48,995
Wolf.

1360
01:20:48,996 --> 01:20:51,409
[Jong Kook's card is also the wolf.]

1361
01:20:51,911 --> 01:20:56,997
Something about the wolf is a bit more...
I'm going to go with the wolf card.

1362
01:20:56,998 --> 01:20:58,382
I'm going to choose the wolf.

1363
01:20:59,285 --> 01:21:01,227
- Park Myung Soo.
- The lamb.

1364
01:21:01,863 --> 01:21:03,825
Do you think that the lamb
even suits you?

1365
01:21:04,263 --> 01:21:06,541
[A lamb face mask?]

1366

[Current count-
Wolf:2 and Lamb:1]

1367
01:21:10,399 --> 01:21:11,971

[IU has the wolf card.]

1369
01:21:15,692 --> 01:21:18,787
[Current count-
Wolf:3 and Lamb:1.]

1370
01:21:18,788 --> 01:21:20,206

1371
01:21:20,207 --> 01:21:24,089

and show us what you've chosen.</i>

1373
01:21:29,358 --> 01:21:30,833
<i>Okay, Yoo Jae Suk?</i>

1374

[Which card will Jae Suk show that
will seal the fate of several people?]

1375
01:21:33,691 --> 01:21:34,983
Wolf.

[He decides not to trade it in!]

1381
01:22:04,758 --> 01:22:07,433
<i>Okay, the current count of the cards is...</i>

1382
01:22:07,434 --> 01:22:10,543
<i>Four wolves, and one lamb.</i>

1383
01:22:10,544 --> 01:22:14,242

1384

Kwang Soo's turn to reveal his card.]

1385
01:22:19,411 --> 01:22:22,300
[If his card ends up being the wolf,
then Jae Suk will also get eliminated.]

[Goodbye, Yoo Hyuk...]

Jong Kook.

1394
01:22:47,254 --> 01:22:50,534
[That means that there's hope for Kwang Soo
and Jong Kook with their guesses.]

1395
01:22:52,251 --> 01:22:54,002
[With the guess of six to two,
Ha Ha may also have a chance at a win!]

1396
01:22:54,003 --> 01:22:55,846
[And Blank Ji also has a chance

[Would she have traded in her card
at the final conclusive round?]

1402
01:23:20,199 --> 01:23:21,603
The lamb.

1403
01:23:27,185 --> 01:23:31,683

[Would he have traded in his card?]

1409
01:24:01,500 --> 01:24:04,827
[If his card is that of a lamb, then
Jong Kook and Kwang Soo are eliminated.]

1410
01:24:05,441 --> 01:24:08,036
[On the flipside, if it's a wolf,
then Ji Hyo and Gary are eliminated.]

1411

[What will Gary's card reveal?]

1412
01:24:18,821 --> 01:24:20,223
Lamb.

1413
01:24:21,104 --> 01:24:22,772
[Gary traded in his card!]

1414
01:24:22,773 --> 01:24:24,520
No!

closer to the edge to make the fall easier.</i>

your card towards the camera.</i>

1421

<i>And shout out in a loud and clear voice
which card it is that you have chosen.</i>

1422
01:25:07,735 --> 01:25:12,428
<i>Okay, on the count of three.
One, two, three.</i>

1423
01:25:12,429 --> 01:25:13,752
[Please let it be the lamb...]

1424
01:25:17,661 --> 01:25:20,633
[Will it be the wolf...]

1425
01:25:20,634 --> 01:25:24,955
[Or the lamb?]

1426
01:25:24,956 --> 01:25:26,198
Lamb!

1427
01:25:26,609 --> 01:25:29,566
[In that case, the current count would be
Wolf:5 and Lamb:4.]

1428

[Members who guessed wrong
go for a nice dip in the pool.]

1429

Ji Hyo!

1430
01:25:50,290 --> 01:25:54,056
[Absolutely amazing...
Ji Hyo and Gary are the winners!]

1431
01:25:54,057 --> 01:25:56,156
How is this even possible!

1432
01:25:57,382 --> 01:25:59,010
This is amazing!

1433
01:26:00,387 --> 01:26:03,928
Today's Wolf and the Lamb Race
victory goes to...

1434
01:26:03,929 --> 01:26:07,359
Song Ji Hyo ad Kang Gary.
Congratulations.

1435
01:26:07,360 --> 01:26:11,464
[Wolf and the Lamb race-
Gary and Ji Hyo are the ultimate victors!]

1436
01:26:13,155 --> 01:26:14,281
I was so close.

1437
01:26:14,282 --> 01:26:17,608
<i>Song Ji Hyo and Kang Gary win the race
from having guessed correctly.</i>

1438
01:26:17,609 --> 01:26:19,240
Ji Hyo wins again!

1439
01:26:19,241 --> 01:26:21,899
[When it comes to gold...
Gold Ji Hyo is unstoppable.]

1440
01:26:21,900 --> 01:26:24,852
[Gold Kang Gary reaping the benefits
by sticking close to Ji Hyo.]

1441
01:26:24,853 --> 01:26:27,198
- You go up and take a look.
- How is it the two of you?

1442
01:26:27,280 --> 01:26:29,821
I can't believe you both wrote down the
same thing even when you weren't together.

1443
01:26:32,897 --> 01:26:34,949
You can use that gold to set up
your newlywed house.

1444
01:26:34,950 --> 01:26:37,275
I really do think that there's
something between you two.

1445
01:26:37,276 --> 01:26:40,254
This is why you need to
be good to me.

1446
01:26:40,255 --> 01:26:41,876
What are you doing?

1447
01:26:41,877 --> 01:26:44,982
- Why? It just felt natural.
- You guys do look natural together.

1448
01:26:44,983 --> 01:26:47,586
It's too bad for IU
because she worked so hard today.

1449
01:26:47,587 --> 01:26:50,222
- I feel bad that you didn't win any gold.
- Yes, I'm very disappointed too.

1450
01:26:50,223 --> 01:26:52,535
IU herself as a person is more precious
than any gold anyway.

1451
01:26:52,995 --> 01:26:55,111
[Where are those kind words coming from?]

1452
01:26:55,112 --> 01:26:56,859
Don't exert yourself.
You'll give yourself a nosebleed.

1453
01:26:57,002 --> 01:26:58,730
It's because I planted my face in
the water when I fell.
