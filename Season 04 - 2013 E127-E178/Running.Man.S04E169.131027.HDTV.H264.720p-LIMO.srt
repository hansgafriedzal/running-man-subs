00:00:02,523 --> 00:00:05,286
[Time- One chilly fall day.]

3
00:00:05,287 --> 00:00:10,652
[Location- Arari Village in Kangwondo.]

4
00:00:12,148 --> 00:00:16,023
[Arrival of the first target.]

5
00:00:18,285 --> 00:00:21,358
<i>Go into the village and find the flag
with your name on it.</i>

6
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:27,467
[Order- Find the flag
with their own name on it.]

7
00:00:28,307 --> 00:00:32,585
[Update on the situation-
Targets still unaware of the situation.]

8
00:00:32,586 --> 00:00:36,019
[Target Number One: Yoo Hyuk.
Target Number Two: Big-nose.]

9
00:00:36,924 --> 00:00:40,112
[Target Number Three: Gary.]

10
00:00:40,113 --> 00:00:43,622
<i>Go into the village and find the flag
with your name on it.</i>

11
00:00:43,623 --> 00:00:44,832
I have to hurry?

12
00:00:45,333 --> 00:00:51,301
[All the members rush into the suspicious
park without even knowing the reason for it.]

13
00:00:51,302 --> 00:00:53,310
Where am I supposed to go?
Where?

14
00:00:55,517 --> 00:00:57,632
What a nice day.

15
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:06,624
[Update on the situation- The targets are
clueless about what's to happen.]

16
00:01:08,298 --> 00:01:11,833
- Don't you think you're rushing too much?
- Where are these flags?

17
00:01:16,887 --> 00:01:18,971
[Target locations are confirmed.]

18
00:01:19,686 --> 00:01:21,178
There it is!
I see it!

19
00:01:22,928 --> 00:01:26,068
[Target Number Five: Ha Ha.
Discovers his own flag.]

20
00:01:27,979 --> 00:01:29,255
Hello.

21
00:01:30,455 --> 00:01:33,137
[Picks up his flag...]

22
00:01:35,284 --> 00:01:36,502
There it is!

23
00:01:38,364 --> 00:01:42,845
[One by one, the members start to
discover their own flags.]

24
00:01:42,846 --> 00:01:44,726
- I got it!
- There it is!

25
00:01:44,727 --> 00:01:47,713
[However, their flag finding mission
scatters them away from one another.]

26
00:01:49,033 --> 00:01:51,377
[Just then...]

27
00:01:51,378 --> 00:01:53,214
[Helmet]

28
00:01:53,215 --> 00:01:54,967
[Padlock]

29
00:01:57,035 --> 00:01:58,620
Why are you putting this helmet on me?

30
00:01:58,621 --> 00:01:59,864
Jae Suk!

31
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:05,542
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing? What is this?

32
00:02:05,543 --> 00:02:07,655
[Everyone gets fitted with
their own helmets.]

33
00:02:07,656 --> 00:02:10,442
- What are you doing?
- Ouch! My ear!

34
00:02:10,443 --> 00:02:13,165
I just went and got my hair done
at the salon this morning!

35
00:02:15,254 --> 00:02:20,028
[All seven members are fitted
with their own helmets.]

36
00:02:20,029 --> 00:02:22,037
What is going on here?

37
00:02:22,038 --> 00:02:23,701
Why are you putting this on me?
What is this?

38
00:02:23,702 --> 00:02:25,925
Move on to the front lawn
of this village immediately.

39
00:02:25,926 --> 00:02:27,092
To the front lawn?

40
00:02:27,093 --> 00:02:28,989
Where's the front lawn?

41
00:02:29,793 --> 00:02:31,286
Where's the front lawn?

42
00:02:31,287 --> 00:02:32,755
- There.
- Over there?

43
00:02:33,767 --> 00:02:37,411
[Off to the gathering location thanks to
the help from the kind helmet agent.]

44
00:02:38,225 --> 00:02:39,447
What is this?

45
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,618
Isn't this the front lawn?

46
00:02:41,619 --> 00:02:42,995
[Going to the location
where they're told to go...]

47
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:45,936
Hey... this is like that movie, 'Saw'.

48
00:02:48,453 --> 00:02:52,518
[Just what is the purpose of these helmets
that they've been forced to wear?]

49
00:02:53,204 --> 00:02:55,180
- What is this?
- Look at this thing.

50
00:02:55,181 --> 00:02:57,607
Why are they making us
wear these helmets?

51
00:02:59,356 --> 00:03:01,479
[A mysterious situation.
Just what is their mission?]

52
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,287
We're all here now.
So what is this all about?

53
00:03:03,288 --> 00:03:05,196
[Now that everyone's been
gathered around...]

54
00:03:05,197 --> 00:03:09,641
[Quite an adorable army of
rainbow helmet soldiers...]

55
00:03:09,642 --> 00:03:11,391
- We have guests today.
- I see someone coming.

56
00:03:11,861 --> 00:03:13,080
I can see someone coming this way.

57
00:03:13,081 --> 00:03:17,952
[Huh?]

58
00:03:18,595 --> 00:03:21,823
[Today's guests rolling up in
a stylish celebrity van.]

59
00:03:24,741 --> 00:03:26,320
Hello.

60
00:03:26,321 --> 00:03:29,755
[A warm and charismatic city man-
Today's hottest star, Joo Sang Wook.]

61
00:03:30,167 --> 00:03:33,372
[But...]

62
00:03:33,373 --> 00:03:35,549
[Huh?]

63
00:03:36,152 --> 00:03:39,723
[Even the charismatic actor wasn't able to
avoid the colored helmet.]

64
00:03:40,214 --> 00:03:41,914
He looks cute in his helmet.

65
00:03:41,915 --> 00:03:44,278
The helmet feels a bit too tight
on my head.

66
00:03:44,279 --> 00:03:46,302
[Having transformed into a cutie pie
in his sky blue helmet.]

67
00:03:47,545 --> 00:03:49,726
[And...]

68
00:03:49,727 --> 00:03:51,866
[There's one more guest!]

69
00:03:53,245 --> 00:03:57,427
[Free spirited, Yang Dong Geun.]

70
00:04:00,379 --> 00:04:03,365
[Charisma]

71
00:04:06,478 --> 00:04:08,987
[But even he isn't able to
avoid the helmet.]

72
00:04:09,668 --> 00:04:11,093
[Flustered]

73
00:04:15,648 --> 00:04:20,408
[Finally able to get the helmet on him
after some struggling.]

74
00:04:20,409 --> 00:04:22,202
I can't believe how good
he looks in his helmet.

75
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:25,743
This is the first time I've ever seen anyone
who looks better in a helmet than Gary does.

76
00:04:25,744 --> 00:04:27,759
He's ruining everything for me today!

77
00:04:28,267 --> 00:04:30,584
He's showing you up, Gary.
He looks better than you in the helmet.

78
00:04:30,585 --> 00:04:32,599
[Dong Geun threatening
Gary's character on this show.]

79
00:04:32,908 --> 00:04:35,150
I'm kind of regretting the fact
that I've become even better looking.

80
00:04:35,418 --> 00:04:37,282
[Um... I don't think there's any
cause for worry there...]

81
00:04:37,283 --> 00:04:39,169
What are we going to be doing today
with these helmets on?

82
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:41,675
What's the reason for even the guests
having to put these helmets on?

83
00:04:41,675 --> 00:04:43,066
This helmet is really hurting my head.

84
00:04:43,067 --> 00:04:44,842
[Just then...]

85
00:04:45,614 --> 00:04:47,886
<i>Your helmets...</i>

86
00:04:48,986 --> 00:04:51,058
[Hm? A moth?]

87
00:04:51,059 --> 00:04:52,560
- What is it?
- I think that's a bee?

88
00:04:55,172 --> 00:04:57,298
No, you really had something
on your head.

89
00:04:58,511 --> 00:04:59,793
I'm serious, there really was something.

90
00:04:59,794 --> 00:05:03,379
[Giraffe seizes his chance,
and attacks the Tiger on the head.]

91
00:05:03,912 --> 00:05:07,712
I'm going to make sure to catch a bug,
and set it on top of your head today.

92
00:05:07,718 --> 00:05:08,913
I promise you.

93
00:05:11,353 --> 00:05:13,207
<i>Today's race...</i>

94
00:05:13,208 --> 00:05:15,146
<i>is titled, The Helmet Race.</i>

95
00:05:15,147 --> 00:05:19,212
[Today's mission-
Escape the helmet race.]

96
00:05:19,213 --> 00:05:23,308
[The race will be performed with
the helmet locked on their heads.]

97
00:05:23,309 --> 00:05:26,716
[Only the person who comes in at
first place in each of the missions...]

98
00:05:26,717 --> 00:05:31,886
[will get the chance to choose a key to
try to unlock the helmet from their heads.]

99
00:05:31,887 --> 00:05:34,079
I guess I won't even get to try then.

100
00:05:34,138 --> 00:05:36,665
<i>There will be a total of four missions today.</i>

101
00:05:36,666 --> 00:05:38,300
<i>This is an individual race.</i>

102
00:05:38,555 --> 00:05:41,600
<i>If the person that comes in at
first place during the first mission</i>

103
00:05:41,601 --> 00:05:44,492
<i>happens to find their own key in their
first attempt to unlock the helmet...</i>

104
00:05:44,493 --> 00:05:47,685
Little butterfly...

105
00:05:47,686 --> 00:05:50,767
- That looked like CG.
- The butterfly just flew away.

106
00:05:50,768 --> 00:05:54,167
[The butterfly flies away... and
comes back to land on Giraffe's nose.]

107
00:05:54,168 --> 00:05:58,669
[Oh ho...]

108
00:06:11,022 --> 00:06:13,584
I really think that Kwang Soo has
the God of entertainment looking out for him.

109
00:06:13,585 --> 00:06:16,306
- Are you okay?
- Jong Kook mentioned that he'd do that.

110
00:06:16,307 --> 00:06:17,654
I'm so jealous.

111
00:06:17,655 --> 00:06:20,340
I really am jealous that all the funny
stuff is always happening to you.

112
00:06:21,028 --> 00:06:24,452
[Unbelievable that the butterfly would pick
that moment of all times to land on his nose.]

113
00:06:24,453 --> 00:06:28,074
I can't believe that the butterfly would land
on Gary first, and go right to Kwang Soo.

114
00:06:28,075 --> 00:06:30,834
['Gae-butterfly', then completes the flight
by becoming the Kwang-butterfly'.]

115
00:06:31,365 --> 00:06:33,599
<i>There will be a total of four missions.</i>

116
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:38,347
<i>If the person who comes in at first place
during the first of those four missions</i>

117
00:06:38,348 --> 00:06:41,001
<i>happens to find their own key
right from the get go...</i>

118
00:06:41,425 --> 00:06:46,160
<i>that person can take off their helmet on the
spot and move right to the final location.</i>

119
00:06:46,161 --> 00:06:47,985
That would be such a huge advantage!

120
00:06:50,088 --> 00:06:52,523
[For the first time in Running Man history...]

121
00:06:52,524 --> 00:06:55,183
[someone will be given
rest time during filming.]

122
00:06:55,184 --> 00:06:57,604
But that person will be
losing out on screen time.

123
00:06:58,305 --> 00:07:00,833
[Will it be the screen time... or rest time?]

124
00:07:00,834 --> 00:07:03,347
<i>But on the flipside,
if a person doesn't come in at first place</i>

125
00:07:03,348 --> 00:07:07,457
<i>or even if they do, if they
don't manage to find their own key</i>

126
00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:09,978
<i>that person will have no choice
but to film</i>

127
00:07:09,979 --> 00:07:15,104
<i>all four missions with the helmet
on their heads throughout the whole day.</i>

128
00:07:19,257 --> 00:07:23,130
[The ever tightening helmet on their heads...
do you want to escape from it?]

129
00:07:23,131 --> 00:07:26,553
[If so, then succeed your mission!]

130
00:07:27,547 --> 00:07:30,733
[Escape the Helmet race- Start!]

131
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:38,307
[Today's race is an individual race.]

132
00:07:39,737 --> 00:07:41,147
Is this it?

133
00:07:41,148 --> 00:07:45,152
[To start off, everyone is given
a random key.]

134
00:07:45,153 --> 00:07:49,937
[But no one knows who's helmet
that key belongs to.]

135
00:07:50,657 --> 00:07:52,072
Am I the only one this is
being given to?

136
00:07:52,073 --> 00:07:54,372
- No.
- Oh, everyone's getting one?

137
00:07:55,362 --> 00:07:56,906
I guess... it makes sense
that everyone's getting one.

138
00:07:56,907 --> 00:07:58,952
It wouldn't be fair if I was
the only person getting it.

139
00:08:00,027 --> 00:08:02,794
Wow... it would be so awesome
if I were to find the key on my first try.

140
00:08:03,006 --> 00:08:05,479
It's possible that this key could be
for my helmet, right?

141
00:08:05,479 --> 00:08:10,377
[If their first key fits their own helmet then
they can escape before the race even starts.]

142
00:08:10,378 --> 00:08:11,732
Seriously?
I can try?

143
00:08:11,733 --> 00:08:15,302
[Could it be?]

144
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:19,965
<i>You can't break it.</i>

145
00:08:21,225 --> 00:08:25,015
[All nine members are each given a key.]

146
00:08:25,016 --> 00:08:29,507
<i>All four of today's races will have
an option for you to choose from.</i>

147
00:08:29,508 --> 00:08:30,587
What is it?

148
00:08:30,588 --> 00:08:33,200
- You have to choose one of these two.
- Okay.

149
00:08:33,201 --> 00:08:34,718
- And you can go do the mission you choose.
- Really?

150
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:36,639
[Must choose one of the two mission cards
for each of their missions.]

151
00:08:38,382 --> 00:08:40,126
What is this?
'Grab bare hands'?

152
00:08:40,562 --> 00:08:41,850
<i>Dead Run?</i>

153
00:08:43,466 --> 00:08:44,847
What is this?

154
00:08:46,874 --> 00:08:49,011
- Have we ever told you what they are?
- You're not going to tell me?

155
00:08:49,012 --> 00:08:50,233
Of course not.

156
00:08:50,398 --> 00:08:51,937
I'll go with 'Grab bare hands' mission.

157
00:08:51,938 --> 00:08:53,816
I'm unbeatable when it comes to
hands and feet.

158
00:08:53,952 --> 00:08:55,620
Grab bare hands.

159
00:08:57,413 --> 00:08:59,518
I have to choose one of these two?

160
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:01,485
[Which of the two missions
will Dong Geun choose?]

161
00:09:01,486 --> 00:09:02,831
Bare hands mission.

162
00:09:02,832 --> 00:09:04,901
Running is too exhausting.

163
00:09:06,784 --> 00:09:09,341
<i>Take your card and be on your way.
You each have your own car to take.</i>

164
00:09:09,342 --> 00:09:11,085
Okay. I will see you all later.

165
00:09:11,086 --> 00:09:12,429
Have a great day.

166
00:09:13,133 --> 00:09:15,170
Are you my VJ for the day?
It's nice to meet you.

167
00:09:15,171 --> 00:09:16,886
I have a feeling that
it's going to be a tough day.

168
00:09:16,887 --> 00:09:19,510
[Forming a good relationship
with his personal VJ for the day.]

169
00:09:19,511 --> 00:09:21,222
I wonder where I'll be heading.

170
00:09:21,223 --> 00:09:24,834
[Escape the helmet race- Start.]

171
00:09:28,158 --> 00:09:31,225
I wonder what will happen today?

172
00:09:31,226 --> 00:09:34,106
Rather than grabbing or catching something...

173
00:09:34,143 --> 00:09:36,241
even though it may be tiring,
running is a better choice.

174
00:09:36,919 --> 00:09:39,983
Kangwondo, seriously...
it's so beautiful here.

175
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,762
So pretty.

176
00:09:41,763 --> 00:09:47,785
[Nature's true beauty that can be seen
outside their car windows.]

177
00:09:48,121 --> 00:09:51,003
Hey, you have to film me too.
Stop just filming the scenery outside.

178
00:09:51,446 --> 00:09:55,413
Even though the scenery is really nice,
I have to be on the show too.

179
00:09:55,414 --> 00:09:57,633
Seriously... you really are
being too much.

180
00:09:58,736 --> 00:10:03,584
To be honest, I'm not really sure about it.
They were talking about some keys?

181
00:10:03,585 --> 00:10:05,870
But to be perfectly honest, I have
no idea what they were talking about.

182
00:10:05,871 --> 00:10:09,145
Maybe I should try unlocking it
with this key.

183
00:10:10,564 --> 00:10:11,804
No, I can't do that.

184
00:10:12,409 --> 00:10:14,369
Because what if it actually unlocks it?

185
00:10:15,315 --> 00:10:17,935
[Sang Wook is proving to be
quite the chatterbox.]

186
00:10:20,621 --> 00:10:22,564
I'm starting to get a slight headache.

187
00:10:22,893 --> 00:10:25,556
But I'm not sure what to do.
Should I get rid of this right away?

188
00:10:26,001 --> 00:10:28,442
If I get the helmet off too quickly,
then I wouldn't be on the show much, right?

189
00:10:28,443 --> 00:10:30,056
That wouldn't be good.

190
00:10:30,698 --> 00:10:33,510
Here I am talking to myself,
and no one is even responding to me.

191
00:10:33,511 --> 00:10:36,637
I need to get to the mission quickly.
Then I'd have someone to talk to.

192
00:10:37,599 --> 00:10:40,038
[Charismatic Doctor Kim Do Han...]

193
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:43,599
[In actuality, he's a nonstop chatterbox?]

194
00:10:44,186 --> 00:10:45,405
No.

195
00:10:52,262 --> 00:10:53,423
It's over there.

196
00:10:53,424 --> 00:10:57,259
[Jungsungun's 'G' village.
Jae Suk arrives at the 'Dead run' mission.]

197
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:58,476
What is this?

198
00:11:01,915 --> 00:11:04,132
- Where is it?
- Do you see it over there?

199
00:11:05,552 --> 00:11:06,742
What's that?

200
00:11:09,713 --> 00:11:15,061
[Deep in the woods... a chicken farm?]

201
00:11:15,062 --> 00:11:18,306
[Cock-a-doodle-doo!
Welcome!]

202
00:11:24,278 --> 00:11:29,759
[You have to untie five ribbons that
are tied around the chickens' feet.]

203
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,504
You want me to untie those ribbons?

204
00:11:31,505 --> 00:11:34,826
- I can't touch chickens.
- I'm too scared to touch chickens.

205
00:11:34,827 --> 00:11:38,212
[Of all people, it has to be the two cowards
who are too afraid to touch chickens.]

206
00:11:38,213 --> 00:11:40,307
- This is absurd.
- You know I can't touch chickens.

207
00:11:40,308 --> 00:11:42,556
<i>You only have to touch the ribbons
to untie them from their feet.</i>

208
00:11:42,556 --> 00:11:44,752
Those chickens aren't going to
allow us to just though their feet.

209
00:11:44,753 --> 00:11:46,800
Don't you know how fast
those chickens are?

210
00:11:46,801 --> 00:11:50,296
Had I known it was going to be like this,
I would've gone with the other mission.

211
00:11:50,297 --> 00:11:52,388
[This is why the mission is called,
the 'Dead run' mission.]

212
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,757
[Meanwhile, the 'Bare hands' mission is...]

213
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,434
Bare hands?

214
00:11:57,435 --> 00:12:01,145
[Kkuk is in the process of dressing
himself in the necessary gear.]

215
00:12:01,895 --> 00:12:04,597
[Just what is this mission
going to be?]

216
00:12:04,597 --> 00:12:07,017
<i>You have to catch the fish
with your bare hands.</i>

217
00:12:07,018 --> 00:12:12,341
[Bare hands mission-
Catch three fish with your bare hands.]

218
00:12:12,342 --> 00:12:14,814
You have to catch three fish with your
bare hands. Then you will be given a key.

219
00:12:14,815 --> 00:12:17,547
Don't you know I used to be on Family Outing?
I'm good at things like this.

220
00:12:17,803 --> 00:12:21,907
[Jungsun Namyun village's pride and joy,
Trout catching.]

221
00:12:22,526 --> 00:12:24,197
Look at this.

222
00:12:24,198 --> 00:12:27,672
[The water is so clear
that it's practically see-through.]

223
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:29,908
[Good luck catching me.]

224
00:12:29,909 --> 00:12:31,491
I'm coming after you!

225
00:12:31,492 --> 00:12:34,346
Your bright colored skin is making it
easy for me to spot you.

226
00:12:34,347 --> 00:12:35,948
This isn't easy.

227
00:12:35,949 --> 00:12:37,450
This is hard!

228
00:12:37,451 --> 00:12:39,980
This is quite hard!
This is hard.

229
00:12:40,015 --> 00:12:43,013
This is hard.
I'm in trouble. This is pretty hard.

230
00:12:43,014 --> 00:12:44,918
What are you doing, Jong Kook?

231
00:12:45,295 --> 00:12:47,617
- Are you fishing?
- I'm trying to catch these trouts.

232
00:12:47,618 --> 00:12:48,755
- What?
- What?

233
00:12:48,756 --> 00:12:51,787
- We have to catch these trouts.
- Goldfish?

234
00:12:53,011 --> 00:12:57,125
[No, trouts are about a hundred times
faster than the goldfish.]

235
00:12:57,126 --> 00:12:58,827
They're so fast!

236
00:12:58,828 --> 00:13:01,509
And their colors are hard to see.

237
00:13:01,581 --> 00:13:03,798
So it makes it hard for us to
see them in the water.

238
00:13:03,798 --> 00:13:05,059
What do we have to catch?

239
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:06,731
Is it even possible to catch them?

240
00:13:06,732 --> 00:13:08,594
- This is no joke.
- Should we corner them somewhere?

241
00:13:08,935 --> 00:13:10,751
We have to corner them somewhere.
I want you to go stand over there.

242
00:13:10,752 --> 00:13:13,165
It's so weird because when I looked from
up there, I saw a ton of fish in the water.

243
00:13:17,499 --> 00:13:19,390
You should move slower.

244
00:13:19,391 --> 00:13:21,894
We should just wait around until
Jong Kook tires out all the fish.

245
00:13:22,791 --> 00:13:25,113
[Just then...]

246
00:13:29,365 --> 00:13:33,995
[He catches one...
but loses it because of the Giraffe.]

247
00:13:33,996 --> 00:13:35,293
- I had it!
- It's still right there.

248
00:13:41,067 --> 00:13:43,357
[A tit for tat in their attempt.]

249
00:13:43,358 --> 00:13:46,476
Run away!
Run away, little trout!

250
00:13:48,581 --> 00:13:50,011
My hand just touched it!

251
00:13:50,855 --> 00:13:54,079
[Loud screams that can be heard
from all over the woods.]

252
00:13:55,337 --> 00:13:56,594
- Look at that one!
- Why?

253
00:13:56,595 --> 00:13:59,441
- What is that thing doing?
- What is it doing?

254
00:13:59,442 --> 00:14:01,019
Why is it doing that?

255
00:14:01,474 --> 00:14:03,833
- It was attacking the other one's head.
- I can't believe I saw that.

256
00:14:03,834 --> 00:14:05,562
[Totally freaked out.]

257
00:14:07,253 --> 00:14:09,641
Did you see how it was pounding
on the head of the other one?

258
00:14:09,805 --> 00:14:13,116
Did you see how that one chicken was
pounding the other one to the ground?

259
00:14:13,117 --> 00:14:14,788
That's no joke.

260
00:14:14,789 --> 00:14:17,433
[That is the power of the UFC league rooster.]

261
00:14:18,527 --> 00:14:21,819
I don't think we can do five ribbons.
How are we supposed to do five ribbons?

262
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,095
Can you lower the number
of ribbons for us?

263
00:14:23,096 --> 00:14:25,120
- I can't even touch them with my hands.
- Song Ji Hyo's really good at catching them.

264
00:14:25,121 --> 00:14:27,620
Ji Hyo needs to come here.
We need her to come and help us.

265
00:14:27,621 --> 00:14:29,002
[We miss you, Ji Hyo.]

266
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:32,042
[Just then, someone else arrives
on location.]

267
00:14:32,043 --> 00:14:33,682
- Ji Hyo.
- Ji Hyo, is it you?

268
00:14:33,683 --> 00:14:35,760
- Come and catch these chickens for us.
- Ji Hyo!

269
00:14:35,761 --> 00:14:37,156
Is it Ji Hyo?

270
00:14:37,157 --> 00:14:40,549
[Third member for the mission,
Chatterbox, Sang Wook.]

271
00:14:40,905 --> 00:14:43,478
- Suk Jin.
- Are you good at catching chickens?

272
00:14:43,742 --> 00:14:45,522
- What?
- Are you good at catching chickens?

273
00:14:45,523 --> 00:14:46,984
- Catch what?
- Chickens.

274
00:14:46,985 --> 00:14:48,377
- Chickens?
- Yeah.

275
00:14:48,378 --> 00:14:50,306
How are we supposed to catch chickens?
With our hands?

276
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:52,572
- Yeah.
- We have to catch them and undo the ribbon.

277
00:14:52,572 --> 00:14:54,110
Can you catch these chickens or not?

278
00:14:54,248 --> 00:14:55,514
I've never done it before.

279
00:14:55,515 --> 00:14:56,778
- Seriously?
- No, I haven't.

280
00:14:56,779 --> 00:15:00,504
- But you look like you're pretty confident.
- Grab these chickens by what?

281
00:15:00,505 --> 00:15:02,902
- Is that how you're coming in?
- Is that not how I'm supposed to come in?

282
00:15:02,903 --> 00:15:04,472
No, that's not how you're
supposed to come in.

283
00:15:04,473 --> 00:15:06,743
- What are we supposed to catch again?
- Aren't you scared?

284
00:15:06,744 --> 00:15:08,607
- I've never once in my life done this before.
- Hey!

285
00:15:08,624 --> 00:15:11,745
Do you see that white chicken
over there?

286
00:15:11,746 --> 00:15:16,173
That one held down another chicken with its
foot and pecked the other one to the ground.

287
00:15:16,174 --> 00:15:17,474
These chickens don't mess around.

288
00:15:18,378 --> 00:15:20,728
Isn't the owner of these
chickens around?

289
00:15:21,409 --> 00:15:23,756
- You don't think you can catch them?
- No, I know I can do it.

290
00:15:23,757 --> 00:15:26,332
I've never caught them before,
but do I just grab them by their necks?

291
00:15:26,332 --> 00:15:27,986
No, you have to grab them
around their body.

292
00:15:27,987 --> 00:15:29,911
- Ah, by the body?
- Yeah, the body.

293
00:15:35,982 --> 00:15:38,298
That one over there looks like
it could even fly out of here.

294
00:15:38,299 --> 00:15:40,684
I just told you.
That one over there is a fighter.

295
00:15:40,685 --> 00:15:43,215
- That scared me.
- That one just flies around here.

296
00:15:43,216 --> 00:15:44,906
You can't provoke those two chickens.

297
00:15:44,907 --> 00:15:47,513
- I'll try catching this one first.
- Okay, try it.

298

[Chicken novice cautiously making
his approach towards a chicken.]

299
00:15:53,888 --> 00:15:55,242

[Huh? He succeeds in his first attempt?]

301
00:15:58,652 --> 00:16:01,449
- That chicken is really docile.
- This isn't too difficult.

302
00:16:01,753 --> 00:16:03,189
Hey, stay still.

303
00:16:03,888 --> 00:16:07,135
[Chatterbox Sang Wook
conversing with the chicken.]

304
00:16:07,752 --> 00:16:09,791
Getting this ribbon off is actually
harder than catching the chicken.

305
00:16:09,792 --> 00:16:11,821
- Yeah, that's hard.
- They shouldn't have tied it in a knot.

306
00:16:12,866 --> 00:16:15,490
Hold still.
I'll let you go in a minute.

307
00:16:15,525 --> 00:16:16,689
Hold still.

- Aren't you scared?
- What?

310
00:16:30,984 --> 00:16:33,734
No, not really.
Okay, I got it.

Aren't you scared?
Aren't you scared at all?

313
00:16:41,893 --> 00:16:43,506
To be honest, I am pretty scared.

314
00:16:47,203 --> 00:16:50,179
[Only been screaming for
the past 30 minutes.]

315
00:16:51,367 --> 00:16:52,990
I'm so annoyed!

316
00:17:03,172 --> 00:17:04,831
- I caught one!
- You got it!

317

- I caught one!
- You got it!

318

[Don't go...]

00:17:25,033 --> 00:17:27,163
They're seriously so fast.

324
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:29,344
They're not even giving us a chance.

325

[Kkuk is still single-mindedly
chasing after the orange trout.]

00:18:00,948 --> 00:18:03,100
- How many do we need to catch?
- It's really hard trying to catch them.

333
00:18:04,367 --> 00:18:06,984
- Over there.
- Dong Geun won't be able to do this.

334
00:18:08,097 --> 00:18:12,048
[Trout with torpedo-like speed.]

335
00:18:12,344 --> 00:18:14,332
[Just then...]

336
00:18:15,936 --> 00:18:18,377
[Mr. Capable gets the feel for it,
and catches his second trout!]

337
00:18:19,165 --> 00:18:20,651
Wait, this isn't my basket!

338
00:18:20,652 --> 00:18:22,237
[Darn...]

339
00:18:22,763 --> 00:18:24,332
Wait, this isn't my basket!
Who's basket is this?

340
00:18:24,333 --> 00:18:26,622
It's my basket.

341
00:18:27,733 --> 00:18:30,636
- One fish for Yang Dong Geun.
- This isn't fair!

342
00:18:30,637 --> 00:18:34,859
[Kkuk's mistake from being too hasty.]

343
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:36,041
I worked so hard to catch that.

344
00:18:36,042 --> 00:18:38,571
I'll help you to catch a fish.

345
00:18:40,396 --> 00:18:44,852
[Dong Geun already has one fish in his basket
even though he just arrived, thanks to Kkuk.]

346
00:18:46,357 --> 00:18:49,400
[Ro-Ro also arrives on location to catch
his share of the fish for the mission.]

347
00:18:49,401 --> 00:18:51,986
I had a feeling this may be it,
but I didn't think I'd be doing it for real.

348
00:18:52,654 --> 00:18:55,611
[Total concentration.]

349
00:19:00,211 --> 00:19:03,290
[Dong Geun...
could he have caught one already?]

350
00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:05,770
Don't move.
Don't you dare go anywhere.

351
00:19:08,746 --> 00:19:10,237
You caught one!

352
00:19:10,238 --> 00:19:13,130
[Succeeds in bare hand fishing
on his very first attempt!]

353
00:19:13,131 --> 00:19:14,827
That's your second fish, Dong Geun.

354
00:19:14,828 --> 00:19:16,549
- This one's mine, right?
- That's yours.

355
00:19:18,246 --> 00:19:19,708
- That's not yours.
- No, this one is mine.

356
00:19:19,709 --> 00:19:22,931
[Two trout already in his basket.]

357
00:19:24,352 --> 00:19:26,622
Hey, we have to corral them towards
where we can see them.

358
00:19:28,738 --> 00:19:30,609
- I caught one!
- How did you catch that?

359
00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:31,846
[Giraffe finally succeeds
in catching his first trout.]

360
00:19:33,616 --> 00:19:36,036
The shallow part of the water?

361
00:19:36,037 --> 00:19:40,274
[Wait...]

362
00:19:40,709 --> 00:19:44,637
[If Dong Geun catches one more fish,
then the mission is all over...]

363
00:19:48,585 --> 00:19:52,234
[Giraffe seems to be up to something as he
makes his way towards Dong Geun's basket.]

364
00:19:52,235 --> 00:19:54,379
[And then...]

365
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,942
[He pushes Dong Geun's basket over!]

366
00:20:00,943 --> 00:20:02,470
Wow, they're so fast!

367
00:20:02,471 --> 00:20:04,607
[The owner of the basket who is
oblivious to what just happened.]

368
00:20:06,999 --> 00:20:10,015
[Giraffe's trickster DNA is
up to no good as always...]

369
00:20:10,016 --> 00:20:12,851
[Sorry, Dong Geun.]

370
00:20:13,303 --> 00:20:15,249
[Just then.]

371
00:20:15,962 --> 00:20:17,418
I almost had it!

372
00:20:18,731 --> 00:20:20,493
I got one!

373
00:20:20,494 --> 00:20:23,097
[What in the world!
Scaredy cat Ro-Ro catches his first trout?]

374
00:20:24,071 --> 00:20:26,011
You have to corral them to a corner.

375
00:20:26,012 --> 00:20:27,923
I know how to catch them now.
I know what I have to do.

376
00:20:28,955 --> 00:20:32,000
Look at this!
All of Dong Geun's fish are gone!

377
00:20:32,001 --> 00:20:33,726
[Discovers Dong Geun's upturned basket.]

378
00:20:33,727 --> 00:20:36,023
- Huh! What happened?
- I swear to you that I didn't do it.

379
00:20:36,024 --> 00:20:38,513
- I swear, I didn't do it.
- What happened? Who did it?

380
00:20:39,862 --> 00:20:42,770
- This one is mine.
- My basket!

381
00:20:43,738 --> 00:20:46,079
- All your fish...
- Who did this?

382
00:20:47,755 --> 00:20:50,096
- You lost both your fish.
- Maybe the current is too strong.

383
00:20:50,097 --> 00:20:52,074
I think we should put some rocks
in our baskets to weigh it down.

384
00:20:52,862 --> 00:20:55,322
[Gullible Dong Geun putting rocks in
his basket without a word.]

385
00:20:55,323 --> 00:20:56,934
I think it's because the current
must be too strong.

386
00:20:56,935 --> 00:20:58,880
That's too bad, Dong Geun.

387
00:21:01,725 --> 00:21:04,555
[Just a lonely single rock in his basket...]

388
00:21:05,018 --> 00:21:08,554
[Yes! I didn't get caught!]

389
00:21:09,653 --> 00:21:12,550
[Just then...]

390
00:21:15,775 --> 00:21:17,565
[Reverent...]

391
00:21:17,566 --> 00:21:19,462
Look, he's praying.
The fighter of the wind.

392
00:21:20,465 --> 00:21:23,452
[Seeking inner peace and solace out of
the shock from the basket incident?]

393
00:21:23,453 --> 00:21:24,991
I'm sorry to say this

394
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:27,547
but if people were to see what you're doing,
they'd think you're filming a documentary.

395
00:21:27,811 --> 00:21:31,751
[Human theater-
The transferor and the Trout.]

396
00:21:31,752 --> 00:21:33,640
You look like a spiritual master.

397
00:21:33,641 --> 00:21:35,737
[An ascetic arrives.]

398
00:21:36,407 --> 00:21:39,340
[Blank Ji is the last member to arrive
on location for the 'Dead run' mission.]

399
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:41,410
- Ji Hyo!
- I'm so glad to see you!

400
00:21:41,411 --> 00:21:42,874
- Come here, Ji Hyo!
- What's wrong?

401
00:21:42,875 --> 00:21:45,113
- Ji Hyo, come here.
- We need you to catch these chickens for us.

402
00:21:45,114 --> 00:21:47,084
- You're good at catching chicken.
- We need you to catch some chickens for us.

403
00:21:47,085 --> 00:21:49,677
You're all standing around like that because
you're too afraid to catch some chickens?

404
00:21:49,764 --> 00:21:52,524
Ji Hyo, please catch these chickens
for us. I'm begging you.

405
00:21:52,966 --> 00:21:55,290
- Let's all do our own work, okay?
- Come on!

406
00:21:55,291 --> 00:21:58,350
Come on, please!
Just catch one for me, Ji Hyo.

407
00:22:01,376 --> 00:22:05,357
[Leaving the whiny cowardly brothers behind,
Ji Hyo forges ahead to do her mission.]

408
00:22:05,358 --> 00:22:07,581
- Is this fun for you?
- Yes.

409
00:22:08,005 --> 00:22:09,851
You don't think this is fun, Jae Suk?

410
00:22:09,852 --> 00:22:13,204
How can you think this is fun?
I'm about to lose my mind right now.

411
00:22:13,963 --> 00:22:16,195
Look at how she's laughing as she
goes after those chickens.

412
00:22:19,777 --> 00:22:21,856
[Oh my goodness.]

413
00:22:22,604 --> 00:22:24,994
I'm sorry, little chicken.

414
00:22:24,995 --> 00:22:26,938
- She's starting, isn't she?
- I'm so sorry, chicken.

415
00:22:26,939 --> 00:22:29,004
You see her, don't you?
Isn't she something else?

416
00:22:29,488 --> 00:22:31,465
Look at her.
Do you see her?

417
00:22:31,466 --> 00:22:33,496
Do things like that not even
scare you?

418
00:22:33,497 --> 00:22:37,102
- I'm sorry, I'll take this off of you.
- Are you not even afraid of that thing?

419
00:22:37,137 --> 00:22:39,366
What's scary about what I'm doing?

420
00:22:39,367 --> 00:22:41,490
- I just feel bad for it.
- They're seriously so fast.

421
00:22:41,491 --> 00:22:44,526
- They really are very fast.
- I don't want to touch them.

Jae Suk:0 Big-nose:0 Sang Wook:4 Ji Hyo:1]

- Look, this one laid an egg!
- Where?

424
00:22:50,622 --> 00:22:52,299
- This one laid an egg.
- Seriously?

425
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:53,716
- It laid an egg.
- Wow!

426

[My goodness!]

427
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:59,073
It laid an egg before it ran away.

428
00:23:00,822 --> 00:23:02,290
Look at that.

429
00:23:03,991 --> 00:23:05,182
- It laid an egg?
- It laid an egg.

430
00:23:05,183 --> 00:23:06,776
This one was born on the battlefield.

431
00:23:07,606 --> 00:23:09,512
Here, try it.

432
00:23:09,513 --> 00:23:11,376
- Try it while it's still warm.
- No, thank you.

433
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:15,141
- I can't believe it laid an egg like that.
- Are you going to try that?

434
00:23:15,142 --> 00:23:16,994
Well, I am pretty thirsty.

435
00:23:17,871 --> 00:23:20,718
[A fresh and warm egg...]

436
00:23:20,719 --> 00:23:22,404
That's very good for your health.

437

- I can feel the energy coursing through me.
- I can't believe you did that.

438
00:23:30,055 --> 00:23:32,630
I can't believe you ate the egg
that the chicken just laid.

439
00:23:33,933 --> 00:23:36,069
Maybe I can win this race today.

440
00:23:39,572 --> 00:23:41,972
[The two white roosters having shown
their pounding fighting skills.]

441
00:23:41,973 --> 00:23:43,884
We will count it as two ribbons if you can
untie the ribbons wrapped around their feet.

442
00:23:43,885 --> 00:23:46,112
I don't think I can even touch
those roosters.

443
00:23:46,228 --> 00:23:47,406
Okay.

444
00:23:48,122 --> 00:23:51,126
[I will channel the energy from the egg,
and catch those roosters!]

[Dong Geun's luck having ran out ever since
Kwang Soo's dirty little trick.]

Are you the one who turned Dong Geun's
basket over earlier?

457
00:25:08,194 --> 00:25:09,370
Me?

458
00:25:09,371 --> 00:25:11,778
- No, it wasn't me.
- I have a feeling it was you.

459

- How could you do that to him?
- No, I didn't do that.

460

- What?
- I was just trying to catch my own fish.

461
00:25:17,996 --> 00:25:20,419
- It was a total mistake.
- We've finally found the culprit.

[Kkuk's suspicions are confirmed,
and the culprit is revealed.]

he's the fighter of the wind?

[So you're the culprit...]

466
00:25:33,363 --> 00:25:35,020

00:27:18,011 --> 00:27:22,128
[If this key is the right one,
Jong Kook can free himself and rest!]

496
00:27:23,021 --> 00:27:24,705
Let me try to turn the key.

497
00:27:24,706 --> 00:27:28,947
[Could it be?]

498
00:27:32,848 --> 00:27:34,204
- Is it not working?
- That mustn't be it.

499
00:27:35,354 --> 00:27:38,686
[It's not the right key.]

500
00:27:44,198 --> 00:27:46,692
Lee Kwang Soo.
You have to go retrieve your key.

501
00:27:48,239 --> 00:27:52,209
[Current ribbon count-
Jae Suk:0, Big-nose:2, Sang Wook:4, Ji Hyo:3]

502
00:27:52,210 --> 00:27:53,995
- Would that kick back?
- Of course.

503
00:27:53,996 --> 00:27:55,230
- Chickens do that?
- Of course.

504
00:27:55,231 --> 00:27:56,890
- It would kick him in the face?
- Of course, it would.

505
00:27:56,891 --> 00:27:58,383
Chickens do that?

506
00:27:58,384 --> 00:27:59,859
What are you two doing?

507
00:28:02,277 --> 00:28:04,365
[About to faint over.]

508
00:28:04,366 --> 00:28:07,758
- Seriously!
- Why would you do that to us?

509
00:28:07,759 --> 00:28:09,545
Seriously!

510
00:28:11,236 --> 00:28:12,674
I'm done.

511
00:28:13,324 --> 00:28:14,487
I'm done.

512
00:28:14,522 --> 00:28:16,735
[Sang Wook succeeds his ribbon mission.]

513
00:28:16,736 --> 00:28:19,012
- What would you like to do?
- Me?

514
00:28:19,013 --> 00:28:20,694
[Dead run mission winner, Sang Wook.]

515
00:28:20,695 --> 00:28:25,315
[Who's key will he select?]

516
00:28:27,011 --> 00:28:28,645
I don't want it to open my lock.

517
00:28:30,481 --> 00:28:32,777
Why do you keep thinking that
your lock is going to open?

518
00:28:32,778 --> 00:28:35,209
- That's not going to happen.
- That would be next to impossible.

519
00:28:35,210 --> 00:28:36,805
I'm going to try.
But I think it's a high probability.

520
00:28:36,806 --> 00:28:39,974
- Is that the one you're choosing?
- Yes, I choose this one.

521
00:28:39,975 --> 00:28:42,457
- You want me to do it for you?
- I'll turn the key for you.

522
00:28:45,546 --> 00:28:47,729
[No way...]

523
00:28:48,429 --> 00:28:50,608
- It opened! It opened.
- Seriously?

524
00:28:50,609 --> 00:28:52,522
- It opened! It opened.
- Seriously?

525
00:28:52,523 --> 00:28:55,755
- You're lying.
- It didn't open.

526
00:28:55,756 --> 00:28:58,567
Why are you lying to us like that?

527
00:28:58,568 --> 00:29:00,568
- What's wrong with you?
- What are you doing?

528
00:29:00,569 --> 00:29:02,731
- When did you learn to lie like that?
- Is the mission all over now?

529
00:29:02,732 --> 00:29:05,589
- After getting the five ribbons?
- When did you turn into such a good liar?

530
00:29:06,007 --> 00:29:08,587
[Lying Sang Wook also fails to
escape from his locked helmet.]

531
00:29:09,966 --> 00:29:12,701
[Time to choose their second mission.]

532
00:29:12,702 --> 00:29:15,563
Ah... a 'standup competition',
and 'lie down competition'?

533
00:29:15,564 --> 00:29:16,906
['Standup competition' or
'Lie down competition'.]

534
00:29:22,831 --> 00:29:26,163
[A simple method of choosing
for this former doctor.]

535
00:29:27,598 --> 00:29:28,848
I didn't see what I chose.

536
00:29:28,849 --> 00:29:31,606
[Sang Wook chooses the standup competition.]

537
00:29:32,582 --> 00:29:34,837
I'm going to go with the
standup competition.

538
00:29:35,312 --> 00:29:37,619
Lying down would be more comfortable
than remaining standing up, wouldn't it?

539
00:29:37,619 --> 00:29:38,824
Okay, lie down competition.

540
00:29:39,102 --> 00:29:41,002
I'm going to go with this one.

541
00:29:41,748 --> 00:29:43,142
The lie down competition.

542
00:29:43,143 --> 00:29:45,928
[Off to the second mission!]

543
00:29:47,028 --> 00:29:49,182
[Meanwhile]

544
00:29:49,183 --> 00:29:50,556
<i>Master!</i>

545
00:29:51,106 --> 00:29:54,011
<i>Excuse me, Elder!
What are you doing?</i>

546
00:29:54,878 --> 00:29:56,842
I feel so at peace out here.

547
00:29:56,843 --> 00:29:58,734
[Filming forgotten,
Master Yang deep in self-meditation.]

548
00:29:58,734 --> 00:29:59,955
<i>He's so peculiar.</i>

549
00:30:00,911 --> 00:30:05,330
[Standup competition vs. Lie down competition.]

550
00:30:05,331 --> 00:30:08,952
I really thought that once I won the mission,
the key I chose would've unlocked it.

551
00:30:08,953 --> 00:30:11,737
[Sang Wook reverting back to his
chatter mode once back in the car.]

552
00:30:12,353 --> 00:30:14,611
I was surprised when the lock didn't open.

553
00:30:14,699 --> 00:30:17,705
It made me realize this is what
Sonogong used to feel back in the day.

554
00:30:18,754 --> 00:30:21,766
[The originator of
the helmet fashion, Sonogong.]

555
00:30:22,233 --> 00:30:25,902
[100% facial match!]

556
00:30:28,294 --> 00:30:30,525
I really want to get a lot of screen time.

557
00:30:32,526 --> 00:30:34,359
I wonder how Dong Geun is doing.

558
00:30:35,976 --> 00:30:38,652
[This man is focusing all his
concentration on his driving.]

559
00:30:38,653 --> 00:30:41,314
[Right]

560
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:44,800
[Straight]

561
00:30:46,806 --> 00:30:49,804
[Left]

562
00:30:56,866 --> 00:30:58,080
This must be it.

563
00:30:59,891 --> 00:31:01,340
What is this now?

564
00:31:06,037 --> 00:31:07,676
What are we doing here?

565
00:31:08,078 --> 00:31:11,338
[Play tug of war, and the first person
to ring the bell with their head wins.]

566
00:31:11,339 --> 00:31:15,397
- Ugh, seriously.
- We're in trouble if Jong Kook shows up.

567
00:31:16,084 --> 00:31:18,729
Suk Jin, isn't it so pretty here?

568
00:31:18,730 --> 00:31:20,707
[This is one chatter loving duo.]

569
00:31:20,708 --> 00:31:23,310
I bet the scenery must be outstanding
once the leaves start changing colors.

570
00:31:23,311 --> 00:31:26,394
[Falling in love with the beauty of the area.]

571
00:31:26,395 --> 00:31:28,878
[The local scenery will soon turn
into a feast for the eyes in the fall.]

572
00:31:28,879 --> 00:31:31,003
- Did you know that I was born here?
- This is your hometown?

573
00:31:31,004 --> 00:31:32,937
- Yeah, this is my hometown.
- Kangwondo is your hometown?

574
00:31:32,938 --> 00:31:35,611
Kangwondo, Jungsun-Gu, Dongyeon Hwa,
308-1.

575
00:31:35,612 --> 00:31:37,408
Hello, Jungsun!

576
00:31:39,035 --> 00:31:41,553
- I'm from Jungsun!
- Jungsun is the best!

577
00:31:41,554 --> 00:31:44,073
Kangwondo, Jungsun-Gu, Dongyeon Hwa,
308-1.

578
00:31:44,074 --> 00:31:46,663
- Jungsun, fighting!
- Fighting!

579
00:31:47,261 --> 00:31:50,779
Another celebrity born from Jungsun.

580
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:53,299
Did you know that this was
Ji Suk Jin's hometown?

581
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:54,984
<i>No, we didn't!</i>

582
00:31:59,151 --> 00:32:02,843
If you didn't know that,
it means that you don't really care?

583
00:32:03,314 --> 00:32:06,051
I'm... a son of this city, Jungsun!

584
00:32:06,052 --> 00:32:08,555
Look at the expression on their faces.
They're just glad you're not their son.

585
00:32:08,556 --> 00:32:10,803
[Son of Jungsun not getting the warm
reception that he would've liked.]

586
00:32:10,804 --> 00:32:13,185
- You're here.
- I'm here.

587
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:14,769
It's Dong Geun.

588
00:32:14,770 --> 00:32:17,571
But wait... we'll be fine as long as
Kim Jong Kook doesn't show up here.

589
00:32:17,572 --> 00:32:18,705
[Still no sighting of Jong Kook...]

590
00:32:18,706 --> 00:32:21,382
[Have you been waiting for me?]

591
00:32:22,433 --> 00:32:24,781
Why does he have to be here?

592
00:32:26,161 --> 00:32:30,115
We're not meant to do this together with him.
He should be doing this all on his own.

593
00:32:30,116 --> 00:32:32,928
I guess we can look at this as a competition
against three men?

594
00:32:32,929 --> 00:32:35,847
Let's do this.
Let's pull it towards us first.

595
00:32:35,848 --> 00:32:37,499
- We have to pull it towards us first.
- We have to work together first.

596
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:38,785
If we don't,
we won't even have a chance.

597
00:32:38,786 --> 00:32:41,524
Just look at the way he's walking here.
He looks so smug and confident.

598
00:32:41,525 --> 00:32:43,312
You figured out what
this is about, haven't you?

599
00:32:44,364 --> 00:32:46,751
Why are you smirking like that?
That's very offensive.

600
00:32:46,752 --> 00:32:49,298
You've got the fighter
of the wind by your side.

601
00:32:49,299 --> 00:32:50,936
- You've got the fighter of the wind.
- No, I'm the windless fighter now.

602
00:32:50,937 --> 00:32:53,148
- He was no joke when we were catching trout.
- Why?

603
00:32:53,149 --> 00:32:54,767
I thought he was a saint or something.

604
00:32:54,768 --> 00:32:56,820
[Having caught the trout like a master.]

605
00:32:59,595 --> 00:33:01,786
[Preparing themselves for
a four way tug-of-war.]

606
00:33:01,787 --> 00:33:03,428
Power of the egg!

607
00:33:03,808 --> 00:33:06,586
Please help me beat
Kim Jong Kook just this once.

608
00:33:07,258 --> 00:33:08,374
Ready.

609
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:10,649
This is driving me crazy.

610
00:33:10,650 --> 00:33:12,069
Power of the egg!

611
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:13,625
Come to me!

612
00:33:15,778 --> 00:33:17,177
Set!

613
00:33:24,370 --> 00:33:28,087
[Jong Kook's force being felt
like a cast iron steel.]

614
00:33:28,965 --> 00:33:30,204
What?

615
00:33:30,732 --> 00:33:33,154
- I feel like we're tied up to a wall.
- What are you talking about?

616
00:33:33,408 --> 00:33:36,334
- We have to join our strengths!
- Yeah, let's join our strength!

617
00:33:36,962 --> 00:33:38,276
Set, go!

618
00:33:42,990 --> 00:33:46,108
[Here I go!]

619
00:33:59,081 --> 00:34:02,360
[Tiger power]

620
00:34:08,021 --> 00:34:11,282
[Just as they predicted?
A three against one competition?]

621
00:34:11,283 --> 00:34:14,539
- We have to work together!
- Come this way!

622
00:34:17,164 --> 00:34:19,093
Come this way!

623
00:34:24,774 --> 00:34:26,720
- Come this way!
- You can't do this!

624
00:34:29,612 --> 00:34:31,599
That's right!
Look at how Kim Jong Kook is being pulled!

625
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:34,234
[1 vs. 3?]

626
00:34:34,235 --> 00:34:35,830
You can't do this!

627
00:34:36,409 --> 00:34:38,084
You can't do this!

628
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,799
Just a little bit more!

629
00:34:41,867 --> 00:34:44,737
- My shoe is about to fall off!
- It's good! His shoe is about to fall off.

630
00:34:45,389 --> 00:34:48,478
[Kkuk even loses his shoe!]

631
00:34:49,589 --> 00:34:52,056
[The 3 vs. 1 plan is working
towards Yoo Hyuk's favor!]

632
00:34:52,057 --> 00:34:53,811
- Dong Geun!
- Which way do I go?

633
00:34:58,423 --> 00:35:00,291
If we keep this up,
Jae Suk could win this battle.

634
00:35:01,129 --> 00:35:03,644
- Wait, in that case...
- We have to work together!

635
00:35:05,331 --> 00:35:07,109
Why are you helping Jae Suk out?

636
00:35:08,818 --> 00:35:11,896
[The coalition starting to fall apart...]

637
00:35:13,222 --> 00:35:15,739
[Just a little bit more...]

638
00:35:16,498 --> 00:35:18,259
[Time!]

639
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:19,707
My shoe!

640
00:35:22,435 --> 00:35:24,407
[YDG doing everything he can.]

641
00:35:30,569 --> 00:35:33,319
[Total exhaustion.]

642
00:35:34,741 --> 00:35:37,115
[Kkuk almost has his shoe back on.]

643
00:35:37,814 --> 00:35:38,939
Time!

644
00:35:40,581 --> 00:35:42,412
- Can't I even call time?
- No, you can't call time.

645
00:35:47,592 --> 00:35:51,818
[Even though he gave
his last spurt of strength...]

646
00:35:56,539 --> 00:35:58,808
[Strength of Tiger is up!]

647
00:35:59,777 --> 00:36:02,551
[The other three members
getting dragged along.]

648
00:36:15,349 --> 00:36:20,145
[Tiger wins!]

649
00:36:21,722 --> 00:36:23,296
Ugh, my stomach hurts.

650
00:36:26,205 --> 00:36:31,140
Since Kim Jong Kook came in at first place,
please choose who's key you'd like to try.

651
00:36:31,141 --> 00:36:33,317
[Kkuk gets the chance to find his key for
winning the four way tug-of-war.]

652
00:36:33,318 --> 00:36:36,066
- I was going to choose Dong Geun's earlier.
- But you didn't? Then try it.

653
00:36:36,906 --> 00:36:38,796
None of us knows who has our key.

654
00:36:40,478 --> 00:36:42,038
Give it to me!

655
00:36:43,398 --> 00:36:45,285
He didn't choose the right key
the last time.

656
00:36:45,286 --> 00:36:47,560
[Decides to go with Jae Suk's key.]

657
00:36:47,561 --> 00:36:49,549
- Ugh, I'm so pissed.
- This wasn't it?

658
00:36:49,550 --> 00:36:53,333
[Big-nosed Brother telling Jong Kook that
Jae Suk's key didn't work for Sang Wook.]

659
00:36:53,334 --> 00:36:55,229
You can't tell him.
That gives him a better chance.

660
00:36:55,230 --> 00:36:57,309
- Really? I didn't know.
- Why would you tell him that?

661
00:36:57,310 --> 00:36:58,951
I'm just happy to be back
in my hometown.

662
00:37:00,954 --> 00:37:02,507
Why? Did it open?

663
00:37:02,508 --> 00:37:05,605
- Did it go in?
- We'd be happy if you went to rest.

664
00:37:06,674 --> 00:37:08,342
No, it didn't open.
Here.

665
00:37:08,343 --> 00:37:10,787
[It's not the right key.]

666
00:37:11,697 --> 00:37:14,399
I've been thinking of
Ji Hyo's key this whole time.

667
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,138
I've been waiting for Ji Hyo's.

668
00:37:16,139 --> 00:37:17,885
If that key works, that would really...

669
00:37:17,886 --> 00:37:21,500
- You two should just get married then.
- Okay, I'll do it for you.

670
00:37:21,501 --> 00:37:23,119
She says she'll marry him.

671
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:26,449
I don't think that's such
a bad idea either.

672
00:37:26,450 --> 00:37:29,477
- She said she'll just marry him.
- No, I said, I'll try the key for him.

673
00:37:29,478 --> 00:37:31,237
[Trying out the key...]

674
00:37:32,955 --> 00:37:36,344
- Put some strength into it and marry her.
- Could it be?

675
00:37:39,362 --> 00:37:41,642
Ugh, I'm ruined!
Oh, wait!

676
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:45,339
- Oh, wait! It turned!
- Seriously?

677
00:37:47,571 --> 00:37:49,094
- It opened!
- Seriously?

678
00:37:49,095 --> 00:37:50,517
[It opened?]

679
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:51,775
It opened!

680
00:37:51,776 --> 00:37:55,215
[Seriously?]

681
00:37:55,216 --> 00:37:57,033
Hurry up and open it for me.

682
00:37:57,857 --> 00:38:00,787
[Gary escapes from his helmet.]

683
00:38:00,788 --> 00:38:02,285
Freedom!

684
00:38:02,286 --> 00:38:04,051
I can't believe that key worked for him.

685
00:38:04,789 --> 00:38:08,275
- What the heck?
- Please give your own key to Song Ji Hyo.

686
00:38:08,276 --> 00:38:10,496
- I'll go look for some wedding halls for us.
- What the heck?

687
00:38:10,497 --> 00:38:12,762
Finish up here quickly, and come find me.
Okay?

688
00:38:13,087 --> 00:38:16,715
- That's just unbelievable.
- Then Dong Geun must have my key.

689
00:38:16,716 --> 00:38:18,904
- Dong Geun has my key. I knew it.
- Why?

690
00:38:18,905 --> 00:38:22,174
[Seems to believe that there's a reason for
Dong Geun having his key.]

691
00:38:22,175 --> 00:38:24,903
Even though this is nice, does
this mean that my screen time is over?

692
00:38:24,904 --> 00:38:28,273
- Great work today, Gary.
- You can go to the final location and rest.

693
00:38:28,274 --> 00:38:29,864
I don't feel very good about that.

694
00:38:31,017 --> 00:38:33,295
[Gary's helmet- Off.]

695
00:38:34,365 --> 00:38:36,686
[Happy meal time.]

696
00:38:36,687 --> 00:38:37,935
That looks so good.

697
00:38:38,515 --> 00:38:42,095
[Jungsun's signature dish- Gonderae rice.]

698
00:38:45,161 --> 00:38:46,625
- That's really good.
- That is good.

699
00:38:47,129 --> 00:38:50,718
[Appreciating the taste with their
helmets still on their heads.]

700
00:38:50,719 --> 00:38:52,866
This is driving me crazy though.
I wish this helmet was off my head.

701
00:38:53,443 --> 00:38:56,767
I agree. This would taste so much better
without the helmet.

702
00:39:05,579 --> 00:39:06,974
What's this now?

703
00:39:06,975 --> 00:39:10,047
- This is the Jungsun market.
- Okay.

704
00:39:10,048 --> 00:39:11,232
[Jungsun's five day market where a huge
public market opens up every five days.]

705
00:39:13,891 --> 00:39:18,824
[Even if it wasn't a famed five day market...]

706
00:39:18,825 --> 00:39:23,099
[It's a place that always stays packed with
the best eats in town at all times.]

707
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:25,488
You will be starting your next mission,
which is the drama mission.

708
00:39:25,489 --> 00:39:27,935
[Jae Suk chose the Drama Mission over the
Comedy Mission, thus having come here.]

709
00:39:28,388 --> 00:39:31,483
[Starting with mission three, 1st and
2nd place winners get the key to try.]

710
00:39:31,484 --> 00:39:33,365
<i>[A lady with an apron.]</i>

711
00:39:33,366 --> 00:39:37,190
If it's a lady with an apron on,
I'm sure there will be plenty of them here.

712
00:39:38,623 --> 00:39:41,851
[Moving into the center of the market in
search of a lady with an apron on.]

713
00:39:41,852 --> 00:39:44,120
Hello.
Yes, hello.

714
00:39:45,271 --> 00:39:47,169
Ma'am, I see that you have
an apron on?

715
00:39:47,170 --> 00:39:49,078
[Found!]

716
00:39:49,079 --> 00:39:51,006
Can you come with me for a moment?

717
00:39:52,174 --> 00:39:54,108
- Do you have some time?
- Why?

718
00:39:54,109 --> 00:39:55,793
Can you come with me for a moment?

719
00:39:55,794 --> 00:40:00,214
I don't know what the mission is,
but can you come help me for a moment?

720
00:40:00,582 --> 00:40:02,628
- Just come with me for a moment.
- I'm not very good at things like this.

721
00:40:03,144 --> 00:40:05,388
I don't even know
what they're going to make us do.

722
00:40:06,261 --> 00:40:08,219
Just come with me.
Hello.

723
00:40:12,934 --> 00:40:14,052
Hello.

724
00:40:14,905 --> 00:40:16,410
- What are we doing? Hello.
- Hello.

725
00:40:17,163 --> 00:40:19,628
- What are we going to be doing?
- Kwang Soo, you still have your helmet on?

726
00:40:20,118 --> 00:40:21,893
- But Gary got rid of his helmet.
- Really?

727
00:40:23,054 --> 00:40:24,654
Freedom!

728
00:40:25,828 --> 00:40:28,213
[Feeling happy and energized
without the helmet on his head.]

729
00:40:29,702 --> 00:40:30,808
Where is this place?

730
00:40:30,809 --> 00:40:33,632
[Arrives at the final location where
he can just rest in peace and comfort.]

731
00:40:34,892 --> 00:40:36,618
Combination?

732
00:40:36,619 --> 00:40:38,632
[Getting his makeup touched up...]

733
00:40:38,633 --> 00:40:41,603
[A huge plate of fresh fruit is served...]

734
00:40:42,598 --> 00:40:44,977
[Helmet free world sure is a nice place...]

735
00:40:44,978 --> 00:40:46,180
What's this?

736
00:40:46,181 --> 00:40:48,021
[What could the mission be?]

737
00:40:48,022 --> 00:40:51,320
Your drama is, a choice drama.

738
00:40:51,321 --> 00:40:53,812
[Choice drama]

739
00:40:54,648 --> 00:40:58,461
It's a choice drama.
You two will be acting out a drama.

740
00:40:58,462 --> 00:41:00,414
[It's a scene from Sang Wook's
recent drama.]

741
00:41:00,415 --> 00:41:03,887
[Must act out the scene with the ladies
that they chose to bring back with them.]

742
00:41:03,888 --> 00:41:05,598
[Everyone is given five minutes to
memorize their lines.]

743
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:06,992
You are given five minutes to prepare.

744
00:41:08,833 --> 00:41:12,749
[Sang Wook having shown the audience his
acting chops as a doctor in a recent drama.]

745
00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:16,177
[Must reenact the scene in this market.]

746
00:41:16,457 --> 00:41:18,667
I'm Doctor Kim in this scene.

747
00:41:18,668 --> 00:41:21,042
- What's your name?
- My name is Lee Hyang Sook.

748
00:41:21,043 --> 00:41:23,342
- Yang Sook.
- No, Lee Hyang Sook.

749
00:41:23,343 --> 00:41:25,344
Hyang Sook... Hyang Sook?

750
00:41:25,345 --> 00:41:26,690
Hyang Sook!

751
00:41:26,691 --> 00:41:28,635
- You know who Moon Chae Won is, right?
- Yes.

752
00:41:28,636 --> 00:41:31,492
You're going to have to act out
Moon Chae Won's character.

753
00:41:31,493 --> 00:41:33,924
- Oh... I have to be Moon Chae Won?
- Yes.

754
00:41:34,125 --> 00:41:35,616
- What's this? Sterilized operation?
- Yes.

755
00:41:35,617 --> 00:41:37,799
<i>[Spray water on the face three times
with a water sprayer.]</i>

756
00:41:39,561 --> 00:41:41,666
I know this is a drama, but...

757
00:41:42,413 --> 00:41:44,473
I'm to spray your face with
the water, right?

758
00:41:45,498 --> 00:41:48,149
So the situation is,
we're all at the hospital.

759
00:41:48,150 --> 00:41:50,038
And we're all operating on a patient.

760
00:41:50,039 --> 00:41:51,706
- I'm the doctor.
- The doctor?

761
00:41:51,808 --> 00:41:55,606
<i>You have to be cautious so that the Director
and his gallbladder doesn't get damaged.</i>

762
00:41:55,607 --> 00:41:58,153
Then you say,
'Doctor, his pressure is dropping'.

763
00:41:58,154 --> 00:42:00,809
- 'Doctor, his pressure is dropping'.
- I have to say that line?

764
00:42:00,810 --> 00:42:04,264
- If you get the line wrong, you're done.
- We got that.

765
00:42:04,667 --> 00:42:06,006
- Are you all ready?
- Yes.

766
00:42:06,007 --> 00:42:08,124
[Jae Suk couple is first
to take on the challenge.]

767
00:42:08,536 --> 00:42:10,210
- Action.
- Doctor Cha.

768
00:42:10,211 --> 00:42:12,516
Let's get ready for the operation.
[We need to start the operation.]

769
00:42:12,516 --> 00:42:13,569
Why?

770
00:42:14,164 --> 00:42:15,577
- Why?
- Jae Suk.

771
00:42:15,843 --> 00:42:17,358
- What?
- You got the line wrong.

772
00:42:17,359 --> 00:42:19,164
- You got the line wrong.
- It was, 'Let's start the operation'.

773
00:42:19,165 --> 00:42:20,508
Move out of my way!

774
00:42:21,088 --> 00:42:23,250
Your partner didn't even get to say anything
because Jae Suk got his line wrong.

775
00:42:23,251 --> 00:42:25,011
It wasn't, 'Let's prepare for the operation'?

776
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:26,976
Okay, ready.

777
00:42:27,541 --> 00:42:28,793
Pil!

778
00:42:30,212 --> 00:42:32,037
What are you doing?

779
00:42:33,153 --> 00:42:35,304
[All he was trying to do was say a cheer...]

780
00:42:35,748 --> 00:42:38,586
[But she sprays him in the face
like it says on the script...]

781
00:42:39,376 --> 00:42:41,964
- Why did you do that all of a sudden?
- Wrong!

782
00:42:42,434 --> 00:42:43,828
Come back here.
You got it wrong.

783
00:42:43,829 --> 00:42:44,990
[Then is it this one?]

784
00:42:44,991 --> 00:42:46,380
[Utter confusion.]

785
00:42:48,163 --> 00:42:51,468
- Okay, it's over.
- Why? I want to try.

786
00:42:52,750 --> 00:42:55,886
[That couple...
Getting a bad feeling about those two...]

787
00:42:57,296 --> 00:43:00,064
[Full of laughter and touching
even though they failed their attempt.]

788
00:43:00,065 --> 00:43:02,018
Are you two out on a date or what?

789
00:43:02,798 --> 00:43:06,332
[A new love blossoming at the market.]

790
00:43:06,333 --> 00:43:09,444
She told me she just washed her hair,
and she's linking her arm with mine.

791
00:43:09,445 --> 00:43:11,260
I want to hold tightly onto his hand.

792
00:43:12,990 --> 00:43:16,070
- Okay, Sang Woo's turn.
- Seriously! What are you two doing?

793
00:43:16,868 --> 00:43:18,633
- Can you take a picture of us?
- You're asking me to take a picture of you?

794
00:43:18,634 --> 00:43:20,769
I'm a celebrity too.

795
00:43:20,770 --> 00:43:23,554
- Come on, take a picture for her.
- Yeah, do it for her.

796
00:43:24,156 --> 00:43:25,749
You're really pulling out all the stops.

797
00:43:25,918 --> 00:43:28,482
[We're the Jungsun Couple.]

798
00:43:28,483 --> 00:43:30,114
If we're going to do this,
let's all take a picture.

799
00:43:30,515 --> 00:43:33,267
[Photo time out of nowhere
in the middle of doing their mission.]

800
00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:39,997
One, two, three.

801
00:43:39,998 --> 00:43:41,465
[Doctor Kim and Director's wife as well.]

802
00:43:41,466 --> 00:43:43,125
Here, I'll take one of you too.

803
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:46,102
[All the couples gets a picture
taken of themselves.]

804
00:43:46,103 --> 00:43:47,118
Let's move on to the mission now.

805
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:48,730
Okay, enough.

806
00:43:48,731 --> 00:43:50,454
[A close up on her only?]

807
00:43:50,455 --> 00:43:51,949
You have to take it of the both of us.

808
00:43:51,950 --> 00:43:54,056
- Why are you leaving me out?
- You looked really pretty in that picture.

809
00:43:54,057 --> 00:43:56,410
You remember your lines, right?

810
00:43:57,191 --> 00:43:58,913
- Okay, we're ready.
- Let's go.

811
00:43:58,914 --> 00:44:00,150
Ready.

812
00:44:00,151 --> 00:44:01,186
Action.

813
00:44:01,187 --> 00:44:03,470
Doctor Cha, let's start the operation.

814
00:44:07,398 --> 00:44:08,596
Scalpel.

815
00:44:13,784 --> 00:44:16,021
[Must break the wood on his head and say...]

816
00:44:16,022 --> 00:44:17,400
Suction.

817
00:44:17,892 --> 00:44:21,342
- I can't believe they already got that far.
- This is the difficult part.

818
00:44:21,343 --> 00:44:23,094
- This is the difficult part.
- One shot, right?

819
00:44:23,095 --> 00:44:26,361
[Hands over the cola.]

820
00:44:27,620 --> 00:44:29,980
He ate a lot of
the blood sausage soup earlier.

821
00:44:36,892 --> 00:44:38,424
We did it!

822
00:44:38,882 --> 00:44:40,525
Why did you say that?

823
00:44:41,850 --> 00:44:43,942
I'll call you back later.

824
00:44:43,943 --> 00:44:46,586
[She took the time out of her
busy schedule to come and help...]

825
00:44:46,587 --> 00:44:48,320
Her shop must be very busy right now.

826
00:44:48,321 --> 00:44:50,862
- I'll put him on the phone.
- But I can't hear through my helmet.

827
00:44:50,863 --> 00:44:53,690
[Passing the phone off to Yoo Hyuk to
explain the situation.]

828
00:44:53,691 --> 00:44:57,550
She's helping me film our show right now.
I'm sorry for the trouble.

829
00:44:58,157 --> 00:44:59,668
Yes.

830
00:45:00,204 --> 00:45:03,525
Yes, I'm sorry.
She'll be back in a little bit.

831
00:45:03,526 --> 00:45:05,178
Yes, thank you.

832
00:45:05,858 --> 00:45:08,011
[He succeeds in getting her to stay.]

833
00:45:09,784 --> 00:45:10,848
Action.

834
00:45:10,883 --> 00:45:11,981
Scalpel.

835
00:45:17,503 --> 00:45:18,984
Suction.

836
00:45:18,985 --> 00:45:21,979
[Lessening the amount of cola.]

837
00:45:21,980 --> 00:45:24,613
- You're dripping.
- You've dripped half of it!

838
00:45:27,955 --> 00:45:31,240
<i>You have to be cautious as not to cause
damage to the Director or his gallbladder.</i>

839
00:45:31,241 --> 00:45:33,770
<i>Doctor Kim, his pressure is dropping.</i>

840
00:45:33,771 --> 00:45:35,481
[Says her line perfectly.]
Give me the balloon.

841
00:45:35,482 --> 00:45:36,608
[Must blow up the balloon
within five seconds.]

842
00:45:36,609 --> 00:45:38,443
[He succeeds the mission if he can
pop the balloon.]

843
00:45:38,444 --> 00:45:42,569
[Must blow up the balloon
within five seconds.]

844
00:45:44,148 --> 00:45:47,390
[I promise to do this right...]

845
00:45:48,958 --> 00:45:51,777
[Will they succeed?]

846
00:45:54,433 --> 00:45:57,204
[Could his drama mission be a success?]

847
00:46:02,975 --> 00:46:05,386
[So close to succeeding...]

848
00:46:08,274 --> 00:46:10,816
We were so close!
Seriously...

849
00:46:12,033 --> 00:46:15,050
[She was so close to being freed...]

850
00:46:15,051 --> 00:46:17,178
You were so close to going back home.

851
00:46:17,179 --> 00:46:19,086
Ugh, that's disappointing.

852
00:46:19,087 --> 00:46:20,336
Action.

853
00:46:20,337 --> 00:46:22,288
[Jungsun's Giraffe couple.]

854
00:46:22,289 --> 00:46:25,309
<i>You have to be cautious as not to cause
damage to the Director or his gallbladder.</i>

855
00:46:25,310 --> 00:46:27,850
- Doctor, his pressure is dropping.
- Give me the balloon.

856
00:46:29,888 --> 00:46:31,732
A really big balloon.

857
00:46:32,710 --> 00:46:34,362
A bigger balloon.

858
00:46:36,738 --> 00:46:39,147
[Will they succeed?]

859
00:46:39,830 --> 00:46:41,475
Please!

860
00:46:42,322 --> 00:46:43,808
Please!

861
00:46:44,323 --> 00:46:46,666
No, that's too high.

862
00:46:47,473 --> 00:46:49,714
Not up there, but we have to put it here.

863
00:46:55,078 --> 00:46:57,798
[In her attempt to place the balloon
at her stomach level...]

864
00:46:57,799 --> 00:46:59,247
[No, that's not what I meant...]

865
00:47:00,701 --> 00:47:03,038
Where do you think
you're placing that balloon?

866
00:47:03,039 --> 00:47:05,353
[Trying to work with the tall Giraffe
put her in an awkward situation.]

867
00:47:06,244 --> 00:47:09,711
<i>This field has completed
its harvesting of the crops</i>

868
00:47:09,712 --> 00:47:13,543
<i>so we have prepared the field into an
arena for you to carry on your mission.</i>

869
00:47:13,544 --> 00:47:17,118
<i>If you look over to the side,
you can see four wicker baskets.</i>

870
00:47:17,443 --> 00:47:21,612
<i>You will find there are 50 potatoes
in each of those baskets.</i>

871
00:47:21,613 --> 00:47:26,999
<i>Without the usage of any tools,
not the basket...</i>

872
00:47:27,455 --> 00:47:32,051
<i>You have to transfer those potatoes to
the baskets sitting at the finish line.</i>

873
00:47:32,608 --> 00:47:34,165
- That's pretty simple.
- Simple, isn't it?

874
00:47:34,166 --> 00:47:35,660
<i>You have one minute to
complete the mission.</i>

875
00:47:35,661 --> 00:47:37,161
Okay!

876
00:47:37,162 --> 00:47:40,943
[Starting off by making a little pouch
with the front of their shirts.]

877
00:47:42,138 --> 00:47:43,911
What are you doing?

878
00:47:44,025 --> 00:47:48,363
[Son of Jungsun trying to gain himself
an advantage at the starting line.]

879
00:47:49,573 --> 00:47:51,915
- Have you lost your mind?
- What are you doing?

880
00:47:51,916 --> 00:47:53,067
[Must pick up the potatoes
as fast as they can.]

881
00:47:55,776 --> 00:47:57,510
[Turning themselves into
human kangaroos.]

882
00:47:58,637 --> 00:48:00,723
[30 seconds left on the clock.]

883
00:48:04,389 --> 00:48:06,433
[Dong Geun and Big-nosed Brother
getting on their way.]

884
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:11,979
[Being on his home ground is making Big-nose
act brash against Dong Geun.]

885
00:48:14,599 --> 00:48:16,868
[Kkuk and Ji Hyo finally
get on their way as well.]

886
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:21,908
[Must be careful as not to
drop any of their potatoes.]

887
00:48:24,954 --> 00:48:27,401
[Shoving Dong Geun out of their way.]

888
00:48:31,837 --> 00:48:35,541
[Must hurry and dump their potatoes into
the baskets at the finish line.]

889
00:48:41,234 --> 00:48:43,226
[Time's up!]

890
00:48:44,598 --> 00:48:48,112
<i>Please count the number of potatoes
that you've brought to the finish line.</i>

891
00:48:48,113 --> 00:48:52,245
Two, four, six, eight... I've got 24.

892
00:48:52,425 --> 00:48:54,366
[Son of Jungsun has 24 potatoes.]

893
00:48:54,819 --> 00:48:56,960
[Blank Ji has quite a stack of
potatoes in her basket.]

894
00:48:58,848 --> 00:49:00,975
- Six...
- What are you doing back there?

895
00:49:03,574 --> 00:49:06,117
- 24... 25.
- What are you doing?

896
00:49:06,118 --> 00:49:07,399
[Blank Ji has 25 potatoes.]

897
00:49:09,884 --> 00:49:11,554
[Dong Geun- Five.]

898
00:49:12,534 --> 00:49:14,534
[Kkuk- 11.]

899
00:49:14,535 --> 00:49:16,306
Song Ji Hyo wins first place.

900
00:49:17,884 --> 00:49:19,286
- Okay.
- I got it.

901
00:49:19,287 --> 00:49:21,298
[Time for Doctor Kim
to take on the challenge.]

902
00:49:25,084 --> 00:49:28,183
Make sure to be cautious as not to cause
damage to the Director and his gallbladder.

903
00:49:28,184 --> 00:49:30,375
Doctor Kim, his pressure is dropping.

904
00:49:30,376 --> 00:49:31,815
Give me the balloon!

905
00:49:43,341 --> 00:49:44,726
She's so cute.

906
00:49:45,015 --> 00:49:48,448
[Will they be able to succeed the big finish?]

907
00:49:54,911 --> 00:49:56,962
[Success]

908
00:49:58,036 --> 00:50:00,562
- I can't believe they won.
- Thank you.

909
00:50:03,057 --> 00:50:05,287
- Thank you, Ma'am.
- Congratulations, Ma'am.

910
00:50:05,288 --> 00:50:06,970
- Congratulations, Ma'am.
- May I see your cellphone?

911
00:50:06,970 --> 00:50:08,601
We're going to win second place.

912
00:50:08,602 --> 00:50:11,145
- This one is going to be ours.
- Okay, on to the next scene.

913
00:50:12,762 --> 00:50:14,737
- Okay, on to the next scene.
- What?

914
00:50:14,738 --> 00:50:16,764
[Changing to a new scene since
the previous scene is now complete.]

915
00:50:17,463 --> 00:50:19,747
No, I like it.
I like having a new scene.

916
00:50:20,418 --> 00:50:23,122
- What are you doing to us?
- You have three minutes, so hurry.

917
00:50:24,091 --> 00:50:26,422
[The next drama scene is...]

918
00:50:26,758 --> 00:50:28,480
[Sandglass]

919
00:50:28,927 --> 00:50:32,369
[A top hit drama that swept the nation
in its wake in the early 90's.]

920
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:39,256
[Turns around and pulls her towards him...]
'It's not revenge! I just wanted you!'

921
00:50:39,257 --> 00:50:42,103
[Hits Choi Min Soo with her gloved hand
as hard as she can on the head.]

922
00:50:42,104 --> 00:50:45,903
'I thought that doing that meant I could
have you because you're my woman!'

923
00:50:46,451 --> 00:50:49,048
'It's all over now.'

924
00:50:49,477 --> 00:50:52,017
'It's not revenge! I just wanted you!'

925
00:50:52,409 --> 00:50:53,927
[Ro-Ro couple's turn.]

926
00:50:53,928 --> 00:50:57,023
[Pulls the woman towards him and says...]
'It's not revenge! I just wanted you!'

927
00:50:57,984 --> 00:50:59,761
[A resounding smack to the head.]

928
00:50:59,762 --> 00:51:02,179
'I thought that doing this meant
that I could have you.'

929
00:51:02,180 --> 00:51:06,251
[Pulls the woman into his arms,
and sit and stand five times in a row.]

930
00:51:06,252 --> 00:51:09,225
[Showing his strength?]

931
00:51:11,477 --> 00:51:13,795
'Because you're my woman!'

932
00:51:14,914 --> 00:51:17,628
- He needs to get beat some more.
- 'Because you're my woman!'

933
00:51:20,078 --> 00:51:24,920
'Because you're my woman!'

934
00:51:28,943 --> 00:51:30,971
[What is this during a romantic moment?]

935
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:39,139
After how many kids did you get like this?
How many?

936
00:51:39,140 --> 00:51:41,778
I have three kids, and ever since my first...

937
00:51:46,001 --> 00:51:48,146
- Okay, we're ready.
- Ready.

938
00:51:50,110 --> 00:51:51,341
Action.

939
00:51:52,187 --> 00:51:54,542
'It's not revenge! I just wanted you!'

940
00:51:59,078 --> 00:52:00,799
[A lethal punch.]

941
00:52:02,448 --> 00:52:05,084
[An automatic round of applause
for her passionate acting skills.]

942
00:52:05,723 --> 00:52:08,138
'I thought that doing this meant
that I could have you.'

943
00:52:12,824 --> 00:52:14,314
'Because you're my woman!'

944
00:52:14,315 --> 00:52:16,008
'Because you're my woman!'

945
00:52:16,009 --> 00:52:17,572
'Because you're my woman!'

946
00:52:17,573 --> 00:52:20,497
[The last spurt of effort
to succeed the mission.]

947
00:52:21,887 --> 00:52:24,864
[Will they succeed?]

948
00:52:26,997 --> 00:52:28,710
[A lethal smack down to the head.]

949
00:52:34,277 --> 00:52:35,937
[Jungsun market's energy maker,
Madame Ok.]

950
00:52:35,938 --> 00:52:37,157
You have to say your line.

951
00:52:39,669 --> 00:52:41,383
'It's all over now.'

952
00:52:42,355 --> 00:52:43,943
You have to say your line.

953
00:52:43,944 --> 00:52:46,319
[She has to say, 'It's all over now.']

954
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:48,521
I knew it would end like this.

955
00:52:49,389 --> 00:52:51,167
I knew it would end like this.

956
00:52:55,591 --> 00:52:57,531
What was my line again?

957
00:52:59,759 --> 00:53:02,773
[Other teams are in a celebratory mood.]

958
00:53:02,774 --> 00:53:06,337
- Why would you do that?
- 'I knew it would end like this.'

959
00:53:07,153 --> 00:53:09,397
- What did you just say?
- It's all over now.

960
00:53:09,398 --> 00:53:11,139
I just want to go home.
I don't think I can do this.

961
00:53:11,140 --> 00:53:13,349
Where do you think you're going?
After you've already beaten me up.

962
00:53:13,350 --> 00:53:15,918
We have to switch our roles and redo it.

963
00:53:16,048 --> 00:53:17,212
Ma'am.

964
00:53:17,213 --> 00:53:18,544
Thank you for your hard work.

965
00:53:18,545 --> 00:53:19,976
[Thank you for the big laughter.]

966
00:53:22,402 --> 00:53:23,912
Ready, action!

967
00:53:24,698 --> 00:53:26,493
[Turns her around as it says in the script.]

968
00:53:26,494 --> 00:53:30,029
'It wasn't revenge.
It was so I could have you.]

969
00:53:33,229 --> 00:53:35,892
[Huh? A cute love punch?]

970
00:53:37,630 --> 00:53:39,294
She has to hit you on the head.

971
00:53:39,295 --> 00:53:43,258
No, everyone has their own style.
It's because she was trying to be cute.

972
00:53:43,259 --> 00:53:45,458
You have to hit him as hard
as I got hit.

973
00:53:45,459 --> 00:53:48,217
[Kwang Soo seems to be
holding some grudges.]

974
00:53:48,218 --> 00:53:51,018
Why did you do that?
You could've hit me harder.

975
00:53:51,525 --> 00:53:52,920
Why did you do that?

976
00:53:53,432 --> 00:53:55,981
Ma'am, why did you do that?
Was it because you didn't want to hurt me?

977
00:53:57,031 --> 00:53:59,250
You don't have to worry
about me so much.

978
00:54:03,212 --> 00:54:05,001
[Ro-Ro couple's second attempt.]

979
00:54:05,785 --> 00:54:08,044
'It wasn't revenge.
It was so that I could have you.'

980
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:12,268
'I thought doing that meant
that I could have you.'

981
00:54:18,063 --> 00:54:20,209
'Because you're my woman!'

982
00:54:21,048 --> 00:54:23,308
'Because you're my woman!'

983
00:54:24,164 --> 00:54:27,000
- Look at how his legs are shaking.
- 'Because you're my woman!'

984
00:54:27,484 --> 00:54:29,848
'Because you're my woman!'

985
00:54:29,849 --> 00:54:31,358
[His face looking worse for wear.]

986
00:54:31,359 --> 00:54:34,281
'Because you're my woman!'

987
00:54:36,241 --> 00:54:38,860
[You are too much woman for me...]

988
00:54:43,527 --> 00:54:45,359
[Wait... it was supposed to be the tray.]

989
00:54:51,575 --> 00:54:52,928
Yes!

990
00:54:52,929 --> 00:54:55,446
We got this, Ma'am.

991
00:54:56,176 --> 00:54:58,766
[They were so close to succeeding...]

992
00:55:00,180 --> 00:55:01,488
It's okay.

993
00:55:03,470 --> 00:55:04,738
Ready.

994
00:55:05,298 --> 00:55:06,342
Action.

995
00:55:06,801 --> 00:55:09,570
'It's not revenge.
It was so that I could have you.'

996
00:55:09,571 --> 00:55:11,486
She needed to have her
back towards you.

997
00:55:12,426 --> 00:55:13,788
Because she didn't have
her back turned?

998
00:55:13,886 --> 00:55:16,690
[Must have the staging correct too.]

999
00:55:16,691 --> 00:55:18,118
- She had her back halfway turned.
- You have to do it accurately.

1000
00:55:18,119 --> 00:55:20,848
[Her face was turned directly
towards the camera.]

1001
00:55:20,849 --> 00:55:22,060
'It was so that I could have you.'

1002
00:55:22,061 --> 00:55:24,501
- She needs to be turned away from you.
- She wasn't turned around!

1003
00:55:25,651 --> 00:55:29,398
- She needs to have her staging right.
- It's because she's really shy.

1004
00:55:29,744 --> 00:55:31,899
But she was just...
why did you do that?

1005
00:55:33,108 --> 00:55:35,460
- Why didn't you have your back turned?
- I'm so sorry.

1006
00:55:35,461 --> 00:55:38,188
- Was it because you were feeling shy?
- Her back must be turned towards you.

1007
00:55:38,189 --> 00:55:39,613
Ready.

1008
00:55:39,614 --> 00:55:41,176
[Too much woman... Ro-Ro couple.]

1009
00:55:42,104 --> 00:55:44,332
'It wasn't revenge.
It was so that I could have you.'

1010
00:55:44,333 --> 00:55:45,890
[Acting getting better and better.]

1011
00:55:45,891 --> 00:55:48,417
'I thought doing that meant
that I could have you.'

1012
00:55:54,797 --> 00:55:56,769
'Because you're my woman!'

1013
00:55:56,770 --> 00:55:59,111
[The most difficult part of the script.]

1014
00:56:00,465 --> 00:56:02,376
'Because you're my woman!'

1015
00:56:04,678 --> 00:56:06,630
'Because you're my woman!'

1016
00:56:07,522 --> 00:56:09,895
'Because you're my woman!'

1017
00:56:09,896 --> 00:56:11,594
Oh no... what to do.

1018
00:56:13,113 --> 00:56:14,788
[An exhausted feeling of emotion.]

1019
00:56:22,003 --> 00:56:25,254
[Now time for the final line...]

1020
00:56:25,255 --> 00:56:28,079
[The last line, 'It's all over now.']

1021
00:56:29,379 --> 00:56:30,685
'It's all over now.'

1022
00:56:30,686 --> 00:56:32,172
'It's all over now.'

1023
00:56:33,783 --> 00:56:35,881
[Success]

1024
00:56:35,882 --> 00:56:37,631
We did it, Hyang Sook!

1025
00:56:39,263 --> 00:56:40,884
[Darn...]

1026
00:56:43,390 --> 00:56:45,901
Hyang Sook!

1027
00:56:45,902 --> 00:56:47,925
[Finishing off with a flying hug?]

1028
00:56:49,988 --> 00:56:52,993
[But why does she have him
in a headlock?]

1029
00:56:53,412 --> 00:56:57,258
<i>Thus, Sang Wook passes in first place,
and Ha Ha also passes in second place.</i>

1030
00:56:57,844 --> 00:57:01,172
[Sang Wook in first, and Ha Ha in second-
Earns a chance to try out a key.]

1031
00:57:02,047 --> 00:57:10,115
[Thank you to all the ladies
for your participation.]

1032
00:57:11,238 --> 00:57:14,147
- I've already tried Jae Suk's key.
- Yes, you did.

1033
00:57:14,896 --> 00:57:17,259
I'll go for the person that I have
absolutely nothing to do with.

1034
00:57:17,260 --> 00:57:19,195
[In that case, try out Ha Ha's key?]

1035
00:57:20,195 --> 00:57:22,601
- It would be crazy if the key fits.
- Here, try turning it.

1036
00:57:22,602 --> 00:57:24,436
It would be crazy if the key works!

1037
00:57:28,724 --> 00:57:30,298
It would be crazy if the key works!

1038
00:57:33,854 --> 00:57:35,811
[It doesn't seem like the key works...]

1039
00:57:35,812 --> 00:57:38,057
I guess your plan is working out though.
You said you wanted to keep staying.

1040
00:57:38,058 --> 00:57:39,916
I didn't try turning it the other way.

1041
00:57:39,917 --> 00:57:41,678
- Yes, you did. I saw you try.
- I did?

1042
00:57:41,679 --> 00:57:43,176
Yeah, you tried it.

1043
00:57:48,605 --> 00:57:50,600
[Ha Ha's selection is?]

1044
00:57:50,601 --> 00:57:52,342
Why don't you try mine?

1045
00:57:52,343 --> 00:57:54,054
- Okay, try it.
- Try it.

1046
00:57:54,055 --> 00:57:55,173
Mine?

1047
00:57:55,208 --> 00:57:57,934
[Selects Jae Suk's key.]

1048
00:57:59,004 --> 00:58:00,312
Okay, try turning it.

1049
00:58:00,313 --> 00:58:01,656
[Will it work?]

1050
00:58:02,048 --> 00:58:06,182
[Will the key fit?]

1051
00:58:11,270 --> 00:58:12,892
It worked!
See? It's opening.

1052
00:58:13,725 --> 00:58:15,464
It worked!
See? It's opening.

1053
00:58:15,465 --> 00:58:17,671
[It opened!]

1054
00:58:18,336 --> 00:58:19,827
I felt it turn!

1055
00:58:20,418 --> 00:58:23,128
Awesome!
I'm freed!

1056
00:58:24,109 --> 00:58:28,114
[After eight long hours, he's
able to escape from his helmet.]

1057
00:58:29,482 --> 00:58:31,237
<i>You can now move on to the final location.</i>

1058
00:58:31,238 --> 00:58:33,272
<i>The rest of you can move on to
the next mission site.</i>

1059
00:58:33,273 --> 00:58:34,880
That seriously feels so good.

1060
00:58:34,881 --> 00:58:37,478
[Ha Ha succeeds in escaping
from his helmet.]

1061
00:58:49,078 --> 00:58:50,800
Oh my...

1062
00:58:51,904 --> 00:58:55,462
[Another helmet freed member arrives.]

1063
00:58:55,463 --> 00:58:57,908
- Come here and relax.
- This is amazing, Gary.

1064
00:58:57,909 --> 00:58:59,386
Have you been like this
the whole time?

1065
00:58:59,387 --> 00:59:02,425
I've had some coffee, fruit,
and fried chicken.

1066
00:59:02,426 --> 00:59:03,777
Here, have one.

1067
00:59:05,307 --> 00:59:08,201
[Even their own personal VJ's get lucky.]

1068
00:59:09,617 --> 00:59:11,725
[Huh? Is he getting ready to nap?]

1069
00:59:11,726 --> 00:59:14,081
[Napping in the midst of filming.
Something that's never happened before.]

1070
00:59:19,646 --> 00:59:23,904
[Meanwhile, the rest of the members are
moving onto their fourth mission.]

1071
00:59:26,142 --> 00:59:31,330
[An unbelievable scene unfolding in front
of their eyes inside the cavern.]

1072
00:59:31,331 --> 00:59:33,299
This is so unbelievable!

1073
00:59:33,300 --> 00:59:36,128
[An unbelievable sight of the
limestone cavern made by nature.]

1074
00:59:36,129 --> 00:59:38,116
- This is unbelievable.
- This is all made by nature.

1075
00:59:38,996 --> 00:59:41,335
- Is this a natural cave?
- It's completely natural.

1076
00:59:41,336 --> 00:59:43,727
[Mouths are gaped open in wonder.]

1077
00:59:44,198 --> 00:59:46,671
Wow, this is absolutely unbelievable.

1078
00:59:50,983 --> 00:59:53,955
[Climbing up the long flight of stairs...]

1079
00:59:53,956 --> 00:59:55,341
- What is this?
- What's this?

1080
00:59:57,174 --> 00:59:58,235
Walnuts?

1081
00:59:58,236 --> 01:00:01,671
[Walnuts?]

1082
01:00:02,697 --> 01:00:05,458
- We have to crack these with our heads?
- With our helmets?

1083
01:00:06,239 --> 01:00:07,674
How many?

1084
01:00:08,259 --> 01:00:10,120
Eight.
Set, go!

1085
01:00:12,511 --> 01:00:14,041
They're not cracking.
This is pretty hard.

1086
01:00:17,750 --> 01:00:21,156
[Walnuts aren't breaking so easily.]

1087
01:00:22,233 --> 01:00:24,059
- It's not working.
- This is hard.

1088
01:00:24,060 --> 01:00:25,842
[Human nutcrackers struggling to
crack their walnuts open.]

1089
01:00:26,751 --> 01:00:29,977
[Smashing down on their walnuts with
every ounce of energy that they have.]

1090

Are you keeping count?

1091
01:00:37,463 --> 01:00:41,524
[Slowly getting the hang of it.]

1092
01:00:42,238 --> 01:00:43,890
[They're all doing pretty good.]

1093
01:00:45,269 --> 01:00:47,603
[Finally!]

1094
01:00:48,257 --> 01:00:50,796
[These nutcrackers are on fire!]

1095
01:00:53,307 --> 01:00:55,079
- Stop!
- I think I've got them all.

1096
01:00:55,080 --> 01:00:58,107
- I finally got it.
- Sang Wook is in first place.

1097
01:00:58,108 --> 01:00:59,557
To be honest...

1098
01:00:59,558 --> 01:01:02,532
I don't even want to come in at first place.
I've come in first at every mission.

1099
01:01:02,532 --> 01:01:04,912
[Even though he continues to come in first,
he still hasn't been able to find his key.]

1100
01:01:04,913 --> 01:01:07,597
What does it matter if I come in first?
I still haven't been able to find my key.

1101
01:01:08,389 --> 01:01:10,815
- Can I have your key?
- Mine?

1102
01:01:10,816 --> 01:01:13,854
[Sang Wook- First place. Jong Kook- Second,
Jae Suk- Third.]

1103
01:01:13,855 --> 01:01:16,261
[Sang Wook selects Jong Kook's key.]

1104
01:01:16,262 --> 01:01:18,735
- I just hope Jong Kook doesn't find his.
- Be quiet!

1105
01:01:20,153 --> 01:01:22,810
- I hope his helmet stays on his head.
- Now that I've had enough screen time...

1106
01:01:22,811 --> 01:01:25,307
[Now that he's had enough screen time...
it's time to escape from the helmet?]

1107
01:01:25,308 --> 01:01:27,952
[Will it work?]

1108
01:01:28,808 --> 01:01:29,901
- Got it.
- You got it?

1109
01:01:31,218 --> 01:01:33,571
[It worked!]

1110
01:01:36,128 --> 01:01:38,250
I can't believe that worked.

1111
01:01:39,555 --> 01:01:42,600
- Doesn't it feel really good?
- I can't look like this on screen though.

1112
01:01:42,601 --> 01:01:45,041
No, you look fine right now.

1113
01:01:47,329 --> 01:01:49,926
- Why are you taking a picture of yourself?
- What are you doing?

1114
01:01:51,181 --> 01:01:53,511
My hair looked kind of cute.

1115
01:01:53,512 --> 01:01:55,748
Everyone look over here and smile.

1116
01:01:57,952 --> 01:01:59,568
- What is he doing?
- It's not working.

selects Ji Hyo's key.]

01:02:09,662 --> 01:02:11,643
What?
What is it?

1120
01:02:11,644 --> 01:02:14,419
[It opened!]

1121
01:02:15,250 --> 01:02:19,312
[Gary's original key that Ji Hyo received
was the key to Jae Suk's helmet!]

1122
01:02:23,817 --> 01:02:25,263
Okay, give me your key.

1123
01:02:25,264 --> 01:02:28,191
[Jae Suk's key is then handed over to Ji Hyo.]

1124
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:31,911
But Jong Kook has to continue
to wear his helmet, right?

1125
01:02:32,505 --> 01:02:35,032
- That's great.
- Okay, onto the next mission.

1126

escaping from their helmets.]

succeeds in escaping from his helmet.]

1128

Wow, that feels so good.

1129
01:02:44,373 --> 01:02:46,815
I don't know what the final mission is,
but I have to do it with the helmet on.

1130
01:02:46,816 --> 01:02:48,626
That could mean trouble.

1131
01:02:49,446 --> 01:02:52,856
I have to escape from this helmet,
but I don't know who has my key.

[Just what is the final mission
that awaits them?]

1133

[7:30 PM.- Jungsun's 'M' Resort.]

1134

Hey, find it quickly.
If we don't, it's all over for us.

1135
01:03:09,224 --> 01:03:11,275
You just keep going.
I'll search around here.

successfully escaped from their helmets</i>

1139

<i>are the members of the attack team
with bells on their shoes.</i>

1140
01:03:29,625 --> 01:03:33,709
Why are we the ones being chased after when
we're the ones who escaped from our helmets?

1141
01:03:33,710 --> 01:03:36,292
Do they have to keep their helmets on
as they come after us?

1142
01:03:36,293 --> 01:03:39,076
- Yes, they still have their helmets on.
- As they keep getting even more aggravated?

1143

Attack Team's name tags, it's deemed useless.]

1146
01:03:47,832 --> 01:03:50,442
<i>Your goal is to find the escape door and
make your way out before being eliminated.</i>

1147
01:03:50,443 --> 01:03:53,891
<i>There are buttons hidden throughout the
place which will open up your escape door.</i>

1148

that are locked up with a padlock.</i>

<i>If you press a total of five buttons,
you'll open up the escape door.</i>

1150

<i>But you have to make sure to press
all five of the buttons.</i>

1151
01:04:05,015 --> 01:04:07,744
This is really terrifying.

01:04:18,973 --> 01:04:22,825
<i>You have to unlock the padlock with the keys
that you guys have in your possession...</i>

1155
01:04:24,016 --> 01:04:25,154
This isn't opening.

1156
01:04:26,214 --> 01:04:29,394
Hey, there's a box in the gym
that's on the third floor.

1157
01:04:29,395 --> 01:04:32,424
- We have to try to open that box.
- Okay, let's all go down there.

1158
01:04:32,425 --> 01:04:34,369
- Let's all try it.
- Here's another one here.

1159
01:04:38,197 --> 01:04:39,341
Seriously!

1160
01:04:39,953 --> 01:04:42,261
Hey, there are a ton of these boxes.

1161
01:04:42,262 --> 01:04:45,974
[Find the correct five boxes
out of these countless number of boxes!]

1162
01:04:45,975 --> 01:04:48,196
Jae Suk!
We're all here.

1163
01:04:48,721 --> 01:04:50,823
Jae Suk!
We're all here.

1164
01:04:51,322 --> 01:04:53,486
Hey, there are a ton of these boxes.

1165
01:04:54,482 --> 01:04:56,054
There's one over there too,
so try opening it.

1166
01:04:56,055 --> 01:04:58,441
- Here's one too.
- Mine won't open.

1167
01:04:58,442 --> 01:05:00,840
[Neither of Jae Suk or
Sang Wook's keys are working.]

1168
01:05:02,394 --> 01:05:05,314
[Meanwhile, at the same time...]

1169
01:05:05,933 --> 01:05:08,283
My head is really itchy.

1170
01:05:08,284 --> 01:05:10,681
Can't you take this off?
I'm getting really annoyed right now.

1171
01:05:10,682 --> 01:05:13,133
- You don't have much time.
- We don't have much time?

1172
01:05:13,986 --> 01:05:16,644
Bell hide-and-go-seek?
We're the attack team!

1173
01:05:16,645 --> 01:05:18,650
[The four helmeted members
are the attack team!]

1174
01:05:18,651 --> 01:05:20,620
<i>[Capture the members who have
freed themselves from their helmets.]</i>

1175
01:05:20,621 --> 01:05:23,360
<i>[You win the race if you eliminate all the
members who are freed from their helmets.]</i>

1176
01:05:23,360 --> 01:05:24,446
This is good.

1177
01:05:24,714 --> 01:05:26,598
Okay, let's go!
Let's go eliminate them.

1178
01:05:26,599 --> 01:05:27,990
[Full of eager energy.]

1179
01:05:28,694 --> 01:05:30,773
I'm sure they've been having
a ball waiting for us.

1180
01:05:30,774 --> 01:05:34,570
[Full of desire to get revenge against the
Defense Team who are freed from their locks.]

1181
01:05:34,571 --> 01:05:36,862
Is it okay if I ram them with my head?

1182
01:05:41,436 --> 01:05:44,016
I don't think mine works at all.
Is my key a fake?

1183
01:05:54,344 --> 01:05:57,028
[Carelessly stepping onto the pebble ground.]

1184
01:05:57,029 --> 01:05:58,253
Ouch, that hurts!

1185
01:05:59,017 --> 01:06:01,694
[But he still has to try.]

1186
01:06:01,695 --> 01:06:03,018
I've found another one.

1187
01:06:06,166 --> 01:06:08,129
[Not the right one either!]

1188
01:06:08,440 --> 01:06:10,056
It's not working, is it?

1189
01:06:10,057 --> 01:06:13,910
[Gary's key not working on the box either.
How about Ha Ha's key?]

1190
01:06:13,911 --> 01:06:15,038
It's not working.

1191
01:06:17,921 --> 01:06:20,036
[It opened!]

1192
01:06:20,037 --> 01:06:21,750
- No, it opened.
- It opened!

1193
01:06:21,751 --> 01:06:24,141
[Ha Ha opens up the first box with his key!]

1194
01:06:24,142 --> 01:06:27,069
[One of the five escape buttons.]

1195
01:06:28,565 --> 01:06:30,717
[Pressing on the first of the five buttons.]

1196
01:06:31,942 --> 01:06:34,417
- I pressed it.
- We got it!

1197
01:06:34,418 --> 01:06:35,870
Here's another one.

1198
01:06:36,374 --> 01:06:38,703
[Just four more buttons in order
to open up the escape door!]

1199
01:06:38,704 --> 01:06:40,143
It was my key.

1200
01:06:41,905 --> 01:06:43,049
What's that?

1201
01:06:44,504 --> 01:06:47,130
<i>The first button has been pressed.</i>

1202
01:06:47,131 --> 01:06:50,122
- What is the first button?
- What does that mean?

1203
01:06:50,123 --> 01:06:51,752
They must've found something.

1204
01:06:53,874 --> 01:06:56,935
<i>There's one advantage that you have
going for your team.</i>

1205
01:06:56,936 --> 01:06:59,534
<i>From the moment that
you press your third button</i>

1206
01:06:59,535 --> 01:07:02,015
<i>a member of the Attack Team will get
ousted one at a time.</i>

1207
01:07:02,519 --> 01:07:04,825
<i>From the moment that
you press your third button</i>

1208
01:07:04,826 --> 01:07:07,326
<i>a member of the Attack Team will get
ousted one at a time.</i>

1209
01:07:07,327 --> 01:07:10,613
<i>Which means, you have the chance to
eliminate three of your opponents.</i>

1210
01:07:10,613 --> 01:07:13,574
<i>In the instance that they find and press
their third button...</i>

1211
01:07:13,575 --> 01:07:16,638
<i>from that point on, one of you will start
being eliminated one by one.</i>

1212
01:07:17,743 --> 01:07:19,738
- Play, rock-paper-scissors.
- Why?

1213
01:07:19,739 --> 01:07:21,715
To determine the order of
your elimination.

1214
01:07:22,089 --> 01:07:23,900
Wait, Suk Jin.

1215
01:07:23,901 --> 01:07:26,091
- Isn't it better if I remained to the end?
- That's right.

1216
01:07:26,092 --> 01:07:27,659
[It would be most useful for them if
Mr. Capable remains alive to the end...]

1217
01:07:27,660 --> 01:07:28,886
[Oh my!]

1218
01:07:28,887 --> 01:07:32,279
[Jong Kook is guaranteed to survive
until the end of the race.]

1219
01:07:32,280 --> 01:07:33,522
It's going just as he had hoped.

1220
01:07:33,523 --> 01:07:35,108
It's going just as he had hoped.

1221
01:07:35,109 --> 01:07:37,345
- Let's finish.
- Rock, paper, scissors.

1222
01:07:38,042 --> 01:07:39,669
[Oh my...]

1223
01:07:39,670 --> 01:07:40,984
Rock, paper, scissors.

1224
01:07:40,985 --> 01:07:44,592
- They're going to think this is planned.
- No!

1225
01:07:44,677 --> 01:07:48,595
[Giraffe is the very first to be eliminated
from the Attack Team.]

1226
01:07:48,596 --> 01:07:51,815
[Just as if they had planned
this out from the beginning...]

1227
01:07:51,816 --> 01:07:55,862
[Once the third button is pressed,
Giraffe will be jail bound.]

1228
01:07:55,863 --> 01:07:57,306
Rock, paper, scissors.

1229
01:07:58,225 --> 01:07:59,751
Rock, paper, scissors.

1230
01:08:01,449 --> 01:08:04,012
[Upon the pressing of the third button,
Kwang Soo is out.]

1231
01:08:04,013 --> 01:08:05,223
[Upon the pressing of the fourth button,
Ji Hyo is out.]

1232
01:08:05,224 --> 01:08:07,158
[Upon the pressing of the fifth button,
Suk Jin is out.]

1233
01:08:07,159 --> 01:08:10,229
[No time to waste!
Time to put their bells on!]

1234
01:08:10,230 --> 01:08:12,303
This is really exciting.
We haven't done the bell chase in a while.

1235
01:08:12,304 --> 01:08:14,396
There' no time to waste.
Let's go do this!

1236
01:08:14,397 --> 01:08:17,482
[One person is feeling extremely desperate
as the rest are feeling the excitement.]

1237
01:08:18,022 --> 01:08:19,766
Why are you so slow?

1238
01:08:22,679 --> 01:08:24,218
Did they already find their second button?

1239
01:08:24,219 --> 01:08:25,799
They must've found their second button.

1240
01:08:25,800 --> 01:08:29,083
<i>The second button has been pressed.</i>

1241
01:08:29,084 --> 01:08:30,374
No!

1242
01:08:33,032 --> 01:08:36,373
[Defense Team's Jae Suk unlocks a box
moments earlier.]

1243
01:08:37,697 --> 01:08:39,312
Hey, I got one!

1244
01:08:39,313 --> 01:08:42,360
[Jae Suk opens a box with his key.]

1245
01:08:42,361 --> 01:08:44,531
[Second of the five buttons to
the escape door is activated.]

1246
01:08:46,845 --> 01:08:49,334
<i>The second button has been pressed.</i>

1247
01:08:49,335 --> 01:08:51,190
- This isn't fair!
- Let's hurry.

1248
01:08:51,988 --> 01:08:55,160
[One more button,
and Giraffe of the Attack Team is out!]

1249
01:08:56,268 --> 01:08:57,938
This is so unfair.

1250
01:08:58,758 --> 01:09:01,910
[Three more escape buttons to go!]

1251
01:09:04,186 --> 01:09:05,637
No, no, no!

1252
01:09:05,638 --> 01:09:07,809
I have to capture at least one of them!

1253
01:09:09,646 --> 01:09:11,360
I have to get my revenge for
keeping me locked up.

1254
01:09:11,361 --> 01:09:13,414
For being stuck in this helmet all day.

1255
01:09:13,415 --> 01:09:16,028
I can't go to jail wearing this helmet.

1256
01:09:22,973 --> 01:09:25,687
- What if they find us?
- We'll be in big trouble if we're found.

1257
01:09:25,688 --> 01:09:27,395
[Must search every one
of the guest rooms as well.]

1258
01:09:27,395 --> 01:09:29,046
If they come, we have to hide.

1259
01:09:29,558 --> 01:09:30,921
Let's go find it.

1260
01:09:34,904 --> 01:09:36,228
I'm scared.

1261
01:09:36,229 --> 01:09:39,204
[Must hurry and find the buttons
before the bells could be heard.]

1262
01:09:39,205 --> 01:09:40,612
I think I'm going to go up a floor.

1263
01:09:46,113 --> 01:09:48,888
[The bells...]

1264
01:09:48,889 --> 01:09:50,284
The other way.

1265
01:09:53,522 --> 01:09:55,547
What do I do?
I hear the bells.

1266
01:10:01,445 --> 01:10:05,418
[Getting... closer...]

1267
01:10:32,928 --> 01:10:35,604
- Hurry!
- Hurry up and get in!

1268
01:10:36,871 --> 01:10:38,255
- Did you hear that?
- I heard it.

1269
01:10:40,339 --> 01:10:42,832
[Their hearts dropping to their feet at
the sound of the terrifying bells.]

1270
01:10:45,231 --> 01:10:46,897
I thought we were dead.
That was terrifying.

1271
01:10:55,656 --> 01:10:57,092
<i>I don't have time on my side.</i>

1272
01:10:57,093 --> 01:10:59,054
<i>I will start this race!</i>

1273
01:11:00,128 --> 01:11:03,023
[Desperation putting Giraffe on edge.]

1274
01:11:04,481 --> 01:11:08,100
- Check all the exit doors.
- There a lot of emergency exits.

1275
01:11:08,101 --> 01:11:10,047
I can't believe this.

1276
01:11:10,858 --> 01:11:13,684
<i>- There a lot of emergency exits.
- What is this?</i>

1277
01:11:15,266 --> 01:11:16,365
What do I do?

1278
01:11:16,366 --> 01:11:18,160
What do I do about this?

1279
01:11:18,732 --> 01:11:21,517
[Sang Wook experiencing the terror
of the bells for the first time.]

1280
01:11:43,696 --> 01:11:47,721
How are we supposed to...
how many of them are there? Five?

1281
01:11:57,859 --> 01:11:59,390
They're like ghosts.

1282
01:12:04,119 --> 01:12:07,056
<i>Kwang Soo. Did you check
the sauna on the second floor?</i>

1283
01:12:08,170 --> 01:12:09,981
- Yes, but I didn't see anyone.
- Right?

1284
01:12:09,982 --> 01:12:11,426
I'm going to check the karaoke room.

1285
01:12:15,115 --> 01:12:18,602
Are the staff members walking around
with bells on their shoes to scare us?

1286
01:12:25,405 --> 01:12:28,031
[Attack Team carefully checking
each of the guest rooms.]

1287
01:12:28,032 --> 01:12:30,784
[The problem is that Giraffe may get ousted
before he can even oust anyone.]

1288
01:12:32,606 --> 01:12:35,940
- I may not even get to do anything.
- You have to check each of the rooms.

1289
01:12:36,708 --> 01:12:37,897
What are you doing?

1290
01:12:37,898 --> 01:12:39,869
I will show you what
a one man show looks like.

1291
01:12:39,870 --> 01:12:41,387
What do I do?

1292
01:12:46,881 --> 01:12:49,307
[The bells are near!]

1293
01:12:49,308 --> 01:12:50,516
There's no one.

1294
01:12:50,517 --> 01:12:52,143
This is the end of the hallway.

1295
01:12:52,144 --> 01:12:53,741
We should check downstairs.

1296
01:12:56,285 --> 01:12:58,352
I doubt they'll get in the elevator.
Check the emergency stairs.

1297
01:13:07,896 --> 01:13:09,185
I really hate this.

1298
01:13:09,186 --> 01:13:10,968
I really hate this feeling.

1299
01:13:21,524 --> 01:13:22,936
- What is this!
- There you are!

1300
01:13:24,090 --> 01:13:26,594
[Discovers Jae Suk of the Defense Team!]

1301
01:13:28,707 --> 01:13:31,646
[Mr. Capable is on the chase!]

1302
01:13:34,387 --> 01:13:38,015
[Escaping into a guest room after hearing
the frightening voice of Mr. Capable.]

1303
01:13:46,427 --> 01:13:49,128
[Mr. Capable on full speed!]

1304
01:13:49,757 --> 01:13:51,731
[This is where Gary went in to hide.]

1305
01:13:54,070 --> 01:13:57,808
[In the end... he's caught by Mr. Capable.]

1306
01:13:57,809 --> 01:13:59,346
Jong Kook.

1307
01:14:01,019 --> 01:14:03,066
[I don't even want to imagine it.]

1308
01:14:05,155 --> 01:14:06,520
Fifth floor.

1309
01:14:06,521 --> 01:14:08,363
- Yoo Jae Suk on the fifth floor.
- Jong Kook.

1310
01:14:08,967 --> 01:14:10,935
- Jong Kook.
- Tell me where the others are.

1311
01:14:10,936 --> 01:14:13,577
Hurry up and tell me where
one of your other members are.

1312
01:14:13,578 --> 01:14:15,573
[Will Jae Suk sell out one of his members
to save himself from this danger?]

1313
01:14:15,574 --> 01:14:17,266
Let's see... tell me where Ha Ha is.

1314
01:14:17,267 --> 01:14:18,680
<i>Ha Ha.</i>

1315
01:14:20,451 --> 01:14:22,915
[He's looking for me!]

1316
01:14:26,231 --> 01:14:28,889
- Come on, give it up.
- Why did you have to be there?

1317
01:14:28,890 --> 01:14:31,820
Why would you ask me that?
I went because I smelled fear.

1318
01:14:31,821 --> 01:14:34,354
Why are you always in the same place
that I'm at?

1319
01:14:35,581 --> 01:14:39,245
[Continuing to listen in on the situation
through their walkie-talkie.]

1320
01:14:39,851 --> 01:14:42,972
<i>Ha Ha... what floor are you on?</i>

1321
01:14:42,973 --> 01:14:45,548
[The truth is, he's had the walkie-talkie on
the whole time to alert his teammates.]

1322
01:14:45,549 --> 01:14:47,330
- Why are you pressing the button?
- No, I wasn't'.

1323
01:14:47,331 --> 01:14:49,984
[And Mr. Capable caught onto his trick.]

1324
01:14:50,613 --> 01:14:53,334
[Dummy... hurry up and run away!]

1325
01:14:57,642 --> 01:15:01,057
Did Jae Suk do it purposely
so that I could hear what was going on?

1326
01:15:03,036 --> 01:15:04,456
Ha Ha.

1327
01:15:07,601 --> 01:15:09,593
<i>Jae Suk, this is Sang Wook.
Where are you right now?</i>

1328
01:15:09,594 --> 01:15:13,369
I've been captured by Jong Kook
on the third floor.

1329
01:15:14,299 --> 01:15:16,681
[Warning him not to
come up to the third floor.]

1330
01:15:16,682 --> 01:15:18,202
You've been captured?

1331
01:15:23,154 --> 01:15:25,282
[So that means I shouldn't go
to third floor.]

1332
01:15:27,583 --> 01:15:30,959
Hurry up and go!
Find the key and oust Jong Kook!

1333
01:15:32,666 --> 01:15:36,447
[The worst kind of hostage
who cannot be kept alive.]

1334
01:15:36,448 --> 01:15:38,382
Hurry up and rip it off.
Just rip it off.

1335
01:15:39,446 --> 01:15:41,192
You two...

1336
01:15:43,813 --> 01:15:47,115
[Defense Team's Jae Suk is eliminated.]

1337
01:15:48,245 --> 01:15:50,367
The hallways are way too long.

1338
01:15:50,941 --> 01:15:53,534
[Jae Suk- Out!]

1339
01:15:59,212 --> 01:16:03,254
<i>Yoo Jae Suk, out.
Yoo Jae Suk, out.</i>

1340
01:16:05,244 --> 01:16:09,025
<i>Yoo Jae Suk, out.
Yoo Jae Suk, out.</i>

1341
01:16:10,325 --> 01:16:13,097
I don't care if it's my teammate or my
opponent, but I just want to see someone.

1342
01:16:15,262 --> 01:16:16,652
This feels too lonely.

1343
01:16:21,356 --> 01:16:24,700
[Huh? He's answering the phone?]

1344
01:16:27,424 --> 01:16:30,044
Ah, Running Man Team's dinner?
Yes.

1345
01:16:30,995 --> 01:16:34,503
[Sang Wook takes the call to confirm dinner
reservation for after the filming is over.]

1346
01:16:34,504 --> 01:16:35,846
Yes, I understand.

1347
01:16:36,508 --> 01:16:39,992
Running Man filming is running late,
so it'll be between 8 and 9 o'clock.

1348
01:16:39,993 --> 01:16:42,756
- Yes, between 8 and 9 o'clock.
- Yes, thank you.

1349
01:16:42,757 --> 01:16:44,758
[Changes the dinner reservations himself.]

1350
01:16:46,561 --> 01:16:49,256
[Meanwhile, Dong Geun is still looking
for a box that would match his key.]

1351
01:16:57,238 --> 01:16:59,318
[There's a box over there...]

1352
01:17:04,918 --> 01:17:07,548
[Overly sensitized to even
the slightest sound?]

1353
01:17:19,358 --> 01:17:20,521
Hey!

1354
01:17:20,522 --> 01:17:23,852
[The chase is on for Yang Dong Geun!]

1355
01:17:23,853 --> 01:17:26,514
Yang Dong Geun is discovered!
Third floor!

1356
01:17:26,988 --> 01:17:30,778
Yang Dong Geun is on the third floor!
Hurry!

1357
01:17:30,779 --> 01:17:34,296
[At this rate, it'll be a frontal face-off!]

1358
01:17:35,812 --> 01:17:37,642
Come to the third floor!

1359
01:17:38,856 --> 01:17:40,334
Third floor!

1360
01:17:41,779 --> 01:17:44,682
[Fleeing as swift as a bird.]

1361
01:17:47,111 --> 01:17:48,758
Third floor!

1362
01:17:48,759 --> 01:17:49,871
[A much slower Big-nosed Brother...]

1363
01:17:53,402 --> 01:17:55,614
[Succeeds in fleeing down to the first floor
in a blink of an eye.]

1364
01:17:56,871 --> 01:17:59,796
Wow, that sound of the bell is terrifying.

1365
01:18:01,463 --> 01:18:02,687
I hate those bells.

1366
01:18:04,724 --> 01:18:06,821
[Okay... let's calm down.]

1367
01:18:11,808 --> 01:18:14,321
[Defense Team's Gary and Ha Ha meet up.]

1368
01:18:14,322 --> 01:18:16,656
You know that Jong Kook was just here, right?

1369
01:18:16,657 --> 01:18:18,043
- He was here with Jae Suk.
- Yeah.

1370
01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:24,689
- Did you find one?
- I found one in Room 557.

1371
01:18:24,690 --> 01:18:26,585
Room 557.

1372
01:18:26,586 --> 01:18:28,540
I think it was Room 557.

1373
01:18:28,541 --> 01:18:31,559
[There was a box that Ha Ha's key
wasn't able to open earlier...]

1374
01:18:36,029 --> 01:18:38,575
[The bells...]

1375
01:18:40,567 --> 01:18:45,022
I'm sure it was a lot of fun for them.
But it's all over now.

1376
01:18:47,484 --> 01:18:49,384
Don't contact me for the time being.

1377
01:18:52,623 --> 01:18:57,509
[The sound of the bells getting closer.]

1378
01:19:04,346 --> 01:19:06,448
[Kwang Soo enters the room!]

1379
01:19:06,449 --> 01:19:07,804
What's this?

1380
01:19:07,805 --> 01:19:10,354
[Discovers a VJ who didn't get
a chance to hide!]

1381
01:19:14,382 --> 01:19:15,435
<i>What's this?</i>

1382
01:19:16,833 --> 01:19:19,144
Once the door opens, I'm just
going to run out without you.

1383
01:19:20,697 --> 01:19:23,045
[Someone's definitely in here...]

1384
01:19:28,100 --> 01:19:29,583
<i>Excuse me.</i>

1385
01:19:38,036 --> 01:19:39,479
Oh my goodness!

1386
01:19:39,480 --> 01:19:41,625
[Gary is discovered!]

1387
01:19:41,626 --> 01:19:43,983
[Gary in extreme danger!]

1388
01:19:45,051 --> 01:19:49,082
[His chance at an escape... is now!]

1389
01:19:49,587 --> 01:19:50,686
[Just then!]

1390
01:19:50,687 --> 01:19:52,857
<i>Lee Kwang Soo, Out.</i>

1391
01:19:52,858 --> 01:19:55,546
<i>The third button has been pressed.</i>

1392
01:19:56,890 --> 01:20:01,328
[At such a crucial moment...
Attack Team's Giraffe is ousted!]

1393
01:20:03,296 --> 01:20:05,027
[Sang Wook discovers a box in
the moment of Gary's danger.]

1394
01:20:07,924 --> 01:20:11,158
[Sang Wook opens the box to
press the button.]

1395
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:14,966
Okay, I've pressed the third button.

1396
01:20:14,967 --> 01:20:17,462
[Third button out of the five
has been activated.]

1397
01:20:18,335 --> 01:20:21,167
[What a crucial moment for this to happen!]

1398
01:20:21,168 --> 01:20:24,743
[Third button is activated,
and Kwang Soo is ousted.]

1399
01:20:24,744 --> 01:20:27,979
[Bad enough that he's first to get ousted,
but to get ousted like this...]

1400
01:20:29,095 --> 01:20:30,497
That was so scary!

1401
01:20:30,498 --> 01:20:32,122
Get away from me!
You're ousted!

1402
01:20:32,123 --> 01:20:33,283
Get away from me right now!

1403
01:20:33,863 --> 01:20:36,777
Hey... that was unbelievable timing.

1404
01:20:38,895 --> 01:20:41,873
[He thought he'd be eliminate one person
before he was ousted...]

1405
01:20:42,925 --> 01:20:45,407
[Ten years shaved off his life.]

1406
01:20:47,337 --> 01:20:49,831
[Gary's key doesn't seem to
work on this lock either.]

1407
01:20:50,737 --> 01:20:52,948
How could that have happened?

1408
01:20:56,775 --> 01:20:59,463
[Going back into hiding from a new
sound of someone else's bells approaching.]

1409
01:21:02,059 --> 01:21:04,781
[Going back into another closet.]

1410
01:21:07,245 --> 01:21:09,989
[This time, he takes the camera himself
so that his VJ doesn't get discovered.]

1411
01:21:16,684 --> 01:21:18,157
- Gae!
- Gae?

1412
01:21:18,870 --> 01:21:21,316
[His last dying message?
Screaming out 'Gae' as he's hauled away.]

1413
01:21:21,317 --> 01:21:24,354
[It must mean that Gae is near.]

1414
01:21:25,330 --> 01:21:26,973
Isn't this a box too?

1415
01:21:26,974 --> 01:21:29,368
[A box that the Defense Team is
seeking is discovered.]

1416
01:21:29,882 --> 01:21:31,350
- Isn't that one of the boxes?
- I think so.

1417
01:21:36,006 --> 01:21:38,904
<i>- We have to find them quickly, Ji Hyo.
- I'll check this one.</i>

1418
01:21:42,638 --> 01:21:45,811
[Mr. Capable and Ace agreeing to
separate and search on their own.]

1419
01:21:45,812 --> 01:21:48,400
If the box is here,
that means that someone is nearby.

1420
01:21:48,401 --> 01:21:50,598
I'm positive that someone is nearby.

1421
01:21:50,683 --> 01:21:54,238
[That's our Ace! Deducing that
Gary is in one of the rooms!]

1422
01:21:54,862 --> 01:21:58,114
[That's the room that Gary is hiding in!]

1423
01:21:59,685 --> 01:22:01,613
This room is different.

1424
01:22:01,614 --> 01:22:03,450
<i>This room is different.</i>

1425
01:22:05,237 --> 01:22:07,601
[Ace Ji Hyo searching every
nook and cranny.]

1426
01:22:09,055 --> 01:22:11,475
[The handsome face having gone gray.]

1427
01:22:27,776 --> 01:22:32,835
[Checking a different room this time.]

1428
01:22:38,532 --> 01:22:39,984
Peek-a-boo.

1429
01:22:39,985 --> 01:22:41,543
Who could this be?

1430
01:22:44,126 --> 01:22:46,658
[Ji Hyo discovers Gary!]

1431
01:22:46,659 --> 01:22:48,073
Kang Gary.

1432
01:22:48,905 --> 01:22:50,456
Please, Ji Hyo!
I'm too scared.

1433
01:22:50,457 --> 01:22:53,176
Why does it have to be you
of all people?

1434
01:22:53,177 --> 01:22:55,907
[Monday Couple's tragic fate?]

1435
01:22:56,371 --> 01:22:59,798
<i>- Why does it have to be you of all people?
- I don't want it to be me either.</i>

1436
01:22:59,799 --> 01:23:01,330
[Is the Monday Couple fighting?]

1437
01:23:02,472 --> 01:23:04,672
- Suk Jin.
- Yeah, it's me. Where are you?

1438
01:23:05,027 --> 01:23:07,328
- Gary's right here.
- Where?

1439
01:23:08,016 --> 01:23:10,341
- He's right there?
- In Room 505.

1440
01:23:10,342 --> 01:23:11,735
Gary.

1441
01:23:12,228 --> 01:23:13,494
Where is he?

1442
01:23:13,495 --> 01:23:15,621
You two want to do it yourselves,
or how do you want to do this?

1443
01:23:15,622 --> 01:23:16,900
I think this is the first time
I've seen you all day.

1444
01:23:16,901 --> 01:23:19,280
[This is the first time they're seeing
each other since the opening scene.]

1445
01:23:19,281 --> 01:23:21,610
- This seriously is the first time.
- I know it is.

1446
01:23:22,886 --> 01:23:25,044
- What do we do?
- We have to eliminate him.

1447
01:23:26,728 --> 01:23:30,505
You two stay in there.
I feel so bad, and I can't eliminate him.

1448
01:23:30,506 --> 01:23:31,855
What do you mean, you feel bad?

1449
01:23:31,856 --> 01:23:33,662
- What do we do?
- I'll grab him.

1450
01:23:33,663 --> 01:23:35,866
[This is a job for
heartless Big-nosed Brother.]

1451
01:23:35,867 --> 01:23:37,295
No, don't!

1452
01:23:38,539 --> 01:23:39,899
Ji Hyo!

1453
01:23:42,250 --> 01:23:44,064
Don't come to the fifth floor!

1454
01:23:44,978 --> 01:23:46,596
This is better than
Ji Hyo ousting you herself.

1455
01:23:47,824 --> 01:23:50,476
[Song Ji Hyo... you're one cold woman.]

1456
01:23:55,111 --> 01:23:56,325
Here it comes.

1457
01:23:56,325 --> 01:23:57,479
Over here.

1458
01:23:58,544 --> 01:24:00,358
Here, you can take this back.

1459
01:24:00,359 --> 01:24:02,062
[Food?]

1460
01:24:02,778 --> 01:24:04,990
If I'm already in jail,
isn't it all over now?

1461
01:24:04,991 --> 01:24:06,756
[Jail snack time.
Helmeted member can't partake.]

1462
01:24:09,349 --> 01:24:12,478
[That's my favorite!]

1463
01:24:16,662 --> 01:24:18,682
Wow... how did you get this?

1464
01:24:18,683 --> 01:24:20,412
I cant believe they'd think to get this.

1465
01:24:20,413 --> 01:24:21,732
Gary!

1466
01:24:23,310 --> 01:24:25,779
[Gary joining them in jail
after getting ousted.]

1467
01:24:25,780 --> 01:24:26,975
Who ousted you?

1468
01:24:26,976 --> 01:24:28,728
Ji Hyo and Suk Jin.

1469
01:24:29,519 --> 01:24:32,151
I know... she really is something.

1470
01:24:35,049 --> 01:24:36,913
That's my favorite ice cream.

1471
01:24:37,508 --> 01:24:40,026
[I'm sure it is...]

1472
01:24:47,907 --> 01:24:49,880
[Want some?]

1473
01:24:55,417 --> 01:24:56,675
Wait for it.

1474
01:24:58,007 --> 01:24:59,333
Wait for it.

1475
01:25:03,083 --> 01:25:05,401
[Three escape buttons are now activated-
Defense Team-3; Attack Team- 3.]

1476
01:25:06,770 --> 01:25:17,001
[So many boxes...
but not many that open.]

1477
01:25:19,079 --> 01:25:20,520
There's a box in the karaoke room.

1478
01:25:23,857 --> 01:25:25,917
Here's another one.
In the restaurant.

1479
01:25:25,918 --> 01:25:29,101
[Everyone gathering at the restaurant
where Ha Ha discovers a box.]

1480
01:25:31,616 --> 01:25:35,619
[Everyone trying out their own keys.]

1481
01:25:35,620 --> 01:25:38,280
[But none of their keys are working.]

1482
01:25:40,394 --> 01:25:44,006
[The chase is closing in,
and they're running out of steam...]

1483
01:25:47,587 --> 01:25:49,497
Here's another one!

1484
01:25:50,423 --> 01:25:51,802
It's heavy.

1485
01:25:53,915 --> 01:25:59,236
[Will they find an escape button in this box?]

1486
01:25:59,595 --> 01:26:01,824
[Sang Wook's key isn't a match.]

1487
01:26:01,825 --> 01:26:04,348
[And Dong Geun's key...]

1488
01:26:05,510 --> 01:26:08,629
[At last!
Dong Geun's key unlocks a box!]

1489
01:26:08,996 --> 01:26:10,937
[Fourth escape button is discovered!]

1490
01:26:11,356 --> 01:26:14,180
[Fourth out of the five buttons
are now activated!]

1491
01:26:22,730 --> 01:26:24,155
Is Ji Hyo out?

1492
01:26:24,802 --> 01:26:27,658
- The fourth button has been pressed.
- No, Ji Hyo!

1493
01:26:28,310 --> 01:26:31,981
<i>Song Ji Hyo, out.</i>

1494
01:26:33,552 --> 01:26:36,307
[Attack Team loses their Ace!]

1495
01:26:37,850 --> 01:26:39,817
<i>Song Ji Hyo, out.</i>

1496
01:26:39,818 --> 01:26:42,796
[Only one escape button to go!
Defense Team- 3, Attack Team- 2.]

1497
01:26:43,123 --> 01:26:47,676
[Now... only one
escape button to left to find!]

1498
01:26:48,763 --> 01:26:52,743
[Searching the rooms one more time.]

1499
01:27:00,005 --> 01:27:02,902
[Mr. Capable, Jong Kook.]

1500
01:27:05,898 --> 01:27:09,336
[They can forget about escaping
if they're caught!]

1501
01:27:14,152 --> 01:27:16,767
[Separate to improve their chances!]

1502
01:27:16,768 --> 01:27:21,322
[Jong Kook chooses to go after... Ha Ha!]

1503
01:27:23,737 --> 01:27:26,797
[Ha Ha- Out!]

1504
01:27:27,654 --> 01:27:31,359
<i>Ha Ha, out.
Ha Ha, out.</i>

1505
01:27:33,236 --> 01:27:36,743
But we just need to find one more
and it's all over, right?

1506
01:27:36,744 --> 01:27:38,431
<i>Once the final button is found</i>

1507
01:27:38,432 --> 01:27:41,931
<i>and at least one member of the Defense
Team escapes through the door</i>

1508
01:27:41,932 --> 01:27:43,384
<i>then the Defense Team wins.</i>

1509
01:27:44,503 --> 01:27:47,278
[Only one escape button left to go!
Defense Team- 2: Attack Team- 2.]

1510
01:27:48,504 --> 01:27:51,262
[Separate to search for the button.]

1511
01:27:55,497 --> 01:27:58,124
[Now they're using their brain!
Passing on the box because it's too light.]

1512
01:28:03,354 --> 01:28:05,397
[Here's another box!]

1513
01:28:07,738 --> 01:28:10,490
[Heavy]

1514
01:28:10,491 --> 01:28:13,274
[This must be the box for Gary's key.]

1515
01:28:15,518 --> 01:28:18,127
[Sang Wook with Gary's key is on his way!]

1516
01:28:20,706 --> 01:28:24,121
[If the button is in that box,
then the escape door will open!]

1517
01:28:29,704 --> 01:28:32,432
[The box is opened!]

1518
01:28:35,447 --> 01:28:38,149
Come on... we should've
been cooler about pressing it.

1519
01:28:38,150 --> 01:28:40,301
Why would you just press it
like that?

1520
01:28:40,302 --> 01:28:42,610
[All they have to do now is escape out
the door without getting caught!]

1521
01:28:42,611 --> 01:28:44,135
Come here, Kim Jong Kook!

1522
01:28:51,479 --> 01:28:56,081
<i>Ji Suk Jin, out.
All the buttons have now been pressed.</i>

1523
01:28:56,082 --> 01:29:00,831
<i>Ji Suk Jin, out.
All the buttons have now been pressed.</i>

1524
01:29:00,832 --> 01:29:03,113
<i>The escape door will now be opened.</i>

1525
01:29:03,114 --> 01:29:07,501
<i>Ji Suk Jin, out.
All the buttons have now been pressed.</i>

1526
01:29:07,502 --> 01:29:09,575
[That was so close...]

1527
01:29:09,576 --> 01:29:11,234
I lasted longer than I expected.

1528
01:29:13,226 --> 01:29:17,894
[All the buttons have been activated!
The escape door is now open.]

1529
01:29:19,027 --> 01:29:21,683
[If they can avoid Mr. Capable's chase,
and make it out the door, they win!]

1530
01:29:29,919 --> 01:29:32,245
- Oh my...
- Jong Kook.

1531
01:29:33,646 --> 01:29:35,805
[Dong Geun is hiding away secretly.]

1532
01:29:36,020 --> 01:29:37,944
- I didn't press it.
- You didn't press the button?

1533
01:29:37,945 --> 01:29:41,173
[Dong Geun must make his escape while
Sang Wook buys him some time.]

1534
01:29:41,174 --> 01:29:43,387
[Now's the time!]

1535
01:29:43,388 --> 01:29:45,438
[Go!]

1536
01:29:46,685 --> 01:29:51,389
[Dong Geun makes a dash for the escape door!
Mr. Capable is hot on his tail.]

1537
01:29:52,988 --> 01:29:56,458
[Will his escape
or elimination come first?]

1538
01:29:56,459 --> 01:29:57,692
Where is the door?

1539
01:29:58,393 --> 01:30:01,128
[Dong Geun arrives on the first floor
where the escape door is located.]

1540
01:30:02,596 --> 01:30:04,702
[Dong Geun discovers the open escape door.]

1541
01:30:08,593 --> 01:30:14,522
[Defense Team's Dong Geun...
the honor of escaping is his.]

1542
01:30:17,737 --> 01:30:19,528
[Defense Team-
Escape mission- Clear.]

1543
01:30:19,529 --> 01:30:21,812
[You did it, Master Yang.]

1544
01:30:23,823 --> 01:30:26,281
[Even after the race is over,
the helmets are still on their heads.]

1545
01:30:26,282 --> 01:30:27,332
Get away from me.

1546
01:30:27,333 --> 01:30:29,862
- Are they going to bed with these on?
- Shut your mouth!

1547
01:30:31,253 --> 01:30:33,030
- What's that?
- It must be our prizes.

1548
01:30:33,031 --> 01:30:34,721
[A table full of prizes for the winners.]

1549
01:30:34,722 --> 01:30:37,445
[Delicious and healthy combo set
of Kangwondo's specialties!]

1550
01:30:37,446 --> 01:30:39,541
Look and see if there's any gold in here.

1551
01:30:40,200 --> 01:30:43,271
[Hanwoo beef over gold!]

1552
01:30:44,363 --> 01:30:47,527
[Even a plethora of their infamous gonderae.]

1553
01:30:47,528 --> 01:30:49,968
After seeing that pile of gonderae,
even this looks like gonderae now.

1554
01:30:49,969 --> 01:30:52,158
[Now that they look at it,
Master Yang's beard looks like...]

1555
01:30:52,159 --> 01:30:56,512
Anyway... the no helmet team wins!

1556
01:30:56,513 --> 01:30:58,641
[A round of applause for the no helmet team!]

1557
01:31:00,079 --> 01:31:01,626
I'm so tired.

1558
01:31:03,945 --> 01:31:07,350
Laughing takes too much energy out of me,
and I don't have any energy left.

1559
01:31:09,073 --> 01:31:11,215
Honey, and Joon Suh.
I won the race.

1560
01:31:11,216 --> 01:31:16,006
Thank you to everyone for helping us
win our victory today.
