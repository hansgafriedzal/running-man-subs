- Where is this place?
- I don't know.

11
00:00:50,317 --> 00:00:52,783
We were in Busan just moments ago,

[Yoo Jung and TOP, who were in attendance at
the Busan International Film Festival...]

00:00:59,552 --> 00:01:03,223
[How did they end up here?]

14
00:01:03,431 --> 00:01:07,423
What brought us here to this
mysterious place?

15
00:01:07,458 --> 00:01:10,550
[They've been brought here by some
unknown force of mystery.]

16
00:01:10,551 --> 00:01:12,800
I feel like I've seen
this tree somewhere before.

17
00:01:14,773 --> 00:01:16,213
You know this tree, don't you?

18
00:01:17,414 --> 00:01:18,960
It's a pine tree.

[A pair of red heels and a capsule?]

20
00:01:29,816 --> 00:01:31,433

00:02:14,477 --> 00:02:16,447
The Wizard of Oz?

34
00:02:18,368 --> 00:02:21,209
Then that means that you're...
Dorothy?

35
00:02:21,244 --> 00:02:22,385
[Then Yoo Jung is Dorothy...]

36
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:24,108
Then you're...

37
00:02:28,182 --> 00:02:29,781
[Huh?]

38
00:02:29,782 --> 00:02:32,213
[I'm Toto?]

39
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:41,626
[Dorothy Yoo Jung, and Brother TOP get
on their bike in search of their friends...]

40
00:02:43,815 --> 00:02:47,151
[But their bike seems to have
a mind of its own.]

41
00:03:00,769 --> 00:03:03,090
I'm not scaring you with
how fast I'm going, am I?

42
00:03:04,985 --> 00:03:07,007
Am I going too fast for you?

43
00:03:10,251 --> 00:03:12,319
I think I see a doorway over there.

44
00:03:12,829 --> 00:03:18,099
[A doorway into another world?]

45
00:03:28,052 --> 00:03:34,413
<i>Dorothy and her brother went off to find their
friends who can help them on their quest.</i>

46
00:03:40,432 --> 00:03:42,826
What is this that we're doing?
Wizard of Oz?

47
00:03:43,589 --> 00:03:46,153
This is quite different than
how the actual story goes.

48
00:03:47,948 --> 00:03:50,870
I can't go near any fireplaces.

49
00:03:57,858 --> 00:04:00,527
[Oh my...]

50
00:04:00,528 --> 00:04:01,670
Gary.

51
00:04:02,097 --> 00:04:04,419
You look like a beekeeper.

52
00:04:07,231 --> 00:04:08,789
Gary.

53
00:04:12,453 --> 00:04:14,698
[Beekeeper Gary bursts out in laughter.]

54
00:04:16,513 --> 00:04:18,259
This is too small on my head.

55
00:04:18,476 --> 00:04:20,894
He's a hip hop star.

56
00:04:20,895 --> 00:04:23,220
He really isn't someone who should be
going around looking like this.

57
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:26,716
I really do experience all sorts of new things
on Mondays and Tuesdays.

58
00:04:27,203 --> 00:04:29,718
- What is this I'm wearing?
- That looks like a funnel.

59
00:04:29,719 --> 00:04:32,019
- That looks like a funnel on your head.
- Do I look okay?

60
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:33,314
Yeah, you look pretty good.

61
00:04:34,841 --> 00:04:35,971
What's that?

62
00:04:36,297 --> 00:04:37,723
A train?

63
00:04:37,724 --> 00:04:38,987
[A train is headed their way?]

64
00:04:39,844 --> 00:04:41,361
- Someone's riding on it.
- What?

65
00:04:41,362 --> 00:04:42,700
What's that?

66
00:04:43,424 --> 00:04:47,293
[Huh? Another tin woodman?]

67
00:04:47,612 --> 00:04:48,983
Who's that riding on the train?

68
00:04:49,946 --> 00:04:52,193
[A tin robot?]

69
00:04:52,791 --> 00:04:54,086
Who are you?

70
00:04:58,875 --> 00:05:01,151
[Wait... a name tag?]

71
00:05:01,152 --> 00:05:03,703
[Yoon. Je. Moon?]

72
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:08,989
[The actor... Mr. Yoon Je Moon?]

73
00:05:10,824 --> 00:05:12,231
It's Je Moon.

74
00:05:12,232 --> 00:05:14,649
- I made a huge mistake.
- It's Yoon Je Moon.

75
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:17,828
- I didn't know.
- Je Moon! Hi!

76
00:05:20,613 --> 00:05:27,015
[An actor who's at the top of his game,
Yoon Je Moon.]

77
00:05:27,016 --> 00:05:31,262
I can't believe they made you
dress up in that costume.

78
00:05:31,262 --> 00:05:34,778
I can't believe they made you wear this
metal pail on your head. That's going too far.

79
00:05:34,817 --> 00:05:37,476
Don't you know what kind of
a man Je Moon is?

80
00:05:39,562 --> 00:05:41,124
You've changed quite a bit.

81
00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:43,289
You never used to laugh
quite so easily back in the day.

82
00:05:43,712 --> 00:05:46,654
He's not someone you can
fool around with like that.

83
00:05:46,655 --> 00:05:49,520
Je Moon isn't someone who
usually laughs so easily.

84
00:05:49,521 --> 00:05:52,208
- Is it weird to see me laugh and smile?
- No, it's not that.

85
00:05:53,309 --> 00:05:55,609
[A benign smile on his face.]

86
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:57,321
Wow... he really has changed a lot.

87
00:05:57,322 --> 00:05:58,821
<i>In moments...</i>

88
00:05:58,822 --> 00:06:01,288
<i>You are aware of Dorothy in Wizard of Oz?</i>

89
00:06:01,289 --> 00:06:04,226
<i>Dorothy and her brother...</i>

90
00:06:04,227 --> 00:06:08,539
<i>They'll be coming here to ask you to join
them in their quest to find the Wizard of Oz.</i>

91
00:06:08,649 --> 00:06:09,879
Really?

92
00:06:12,528 --> 00:06:17,237
[Dorothy and her friends leaving for
a world of adventure.]

93
00:06:17,238 --> 00:06:21,663
[Just what awaits them
at the end of their adventure?]

94
00:06:24,426 --> 00:06:26,750
What's going on with the weather here?

95
00:06:26,751 --> 00:06:28,949
- What's going on here?
- What is this?

96
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:31,237
What are we supposed to be?
Street beggars?

97
00:06:31,533 --> 00:06:36,217
We're not even scarecrows.
You have us standing here like beggars.

98
00:06:36,872 --> 00:06:40,387
<i>Scarecrow Ha Ha and Scarecrow Kwang Soo
did not possess any intelligence.</i>

99
00:06:42,001 --> 00:06:45,980
<i>Their lack of any intelligence always
left them struggling.</i>

100
00:06:47,076 --> 00:06:50,066
<i>You two are going to play a round of
the Blue Flag, White Flag game</i>

101
00:06:50,067 --> 00:06:51,998
<i>to gain some intelligence
for yourselves.</i>

102
00:06:53,941 --> 00:06:56,939
Can't you do it in a nicer way?

103
00:06:58,381 --> 00:07:00,476
[Ah... their arms...]

104
00:07:04,494 --> 00:07:08,799
<i>We're going to play 'Lift the flag' game
in order for you to gain your intelligence.</i>

105
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:12,048
<i>What do you think you should do if I say,
'Lift up the blue flag'?</i>

106
00:07:13,196 --> 00:07:15,440
<i>Then you should probably lower
the white flag, don't you think?</i>

107
00:07:16,042 --> 00:07:17,801
Can't you ever make it simple?

108
00:07:18,531 --> 00:07:21,683
If he tells you to raise your blue flag,
then you have to lower your white flag.

109
00:07:21,684 --> 00:07:23,972
<i>And what if I tell you to
raise your white flag?</i>

110
00:07:24,115 --> 00:07:25,822
<i>Then you should probably lower
your blue flag, right?</i>

111
00:07:27,931 --> 00:07:30,733
This is hard.
Maybe I really don't have any intelligence.

112
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:32,753
<i>Lower your blue flag.</i>

113
00:07:34,415 --> 00:07:35,489
Okay, then I raise it?

114
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:37,148
<i>Lower your white flag.</i>

115
00:07:37,149 --> 00:07:39,842
[A hot mess.]

116
00:07:39,843 --> 00:07:40,868
<i>Raise your blue flag.</i>

117
00:07:40,869 --> 00:07:45,393
[Lack of intelligence made plainly obvious.]

118
00:07:46,161 --> 00:07:47,839
<i>Don't raise the blue flag,
but lower your white flag.</i>

119
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:50,643
- What?
- Don't raise the blue flag, lower the white.

120
00:07:51,693 --> 00:07:53,825
<i>Don't lower the white flag,
but lower the blue flag.</i>

121
00:07:54,677 --> 00:07:56,768
Why do we have to do this!

122
00:07:57,282 --> 00:07:58,841
Why do we have to do this?

123
00:07:58,842 --> 00:08:00,979
<i>As you can see for yourselves,
you don't have any intelligence.</i>

124
00:08:01,705 --> 00:08:04,657
What does this have anything
to do with intelligence?

125
00:08:05,419 --> 00:08:08,700
<i>Cowardly Lion Jong Kook and Lion Ji Hyo

afraid of the ax</i>

127

<i>they decided to try wood cutting
to earn courage.</i>

128
00:08:13,888 --> 00:08:15,697
I'm so scared of this ax.

129
00:08:15,698 --> 00:08:18,347
I think you're slamming down
on that too hard.

130
00:08:18,348 --> 00:08:21,249
- Get up.
- How am I to do it when you can't do it?

131
00:08:41,576 --> 00:08:43,016
The cowardly lion.

132
00:08:47,056 --> 00:08:50,680
[Cowardly lions' wood cutting show.]

133
00:08:51,104 --> 00:08:52,589
You frighten me.

134
00:08:53,507 --> 00:08:55,322
Why do I have to break these?

135
00:08:55,323 --> 00:08:56,971
[Brick breaking this time?]

136
00:08:56,972 --> 00:08:58,383
That's how you do it.

137
00:09:02,922 --> 00:09:04,366
I feel so bad for these bricks.

138
00:09:04,367 --> 00:09:06,462
I broke them all.

139
00:09:06,463 --> 00:09:08,316
What to do?
The poor things.

140
00:09:08,317 --> 00:09:09,800
I feel so bad for them.

141
00:09:09,801 --> 00:09:12,805
Why are you making us do all this
so early in the morning?

142
00:09:12,806 --> 00:09:14,806
I'm so scared.

143
00:09:15,542 --> 00:09:18,420
[Trying to earn some intelligence by catching
the tissue that are flying in the air.]

144

Hey!

[Follow the yellow brick road.]

149
00:09:40,909 --> 00:09:45,999
[Dorothy Yoo Jung and Brother TOP in search
of their friends who could help them.]

150
00:09:46,883 --> 00:09:49,009

before we find any of them.

151
00:09:51,234 --> 00:09:53,054

171
00:10:51,957 --> 00:10:53,539
What took you guys so long?

172
00:10:55,007 --> 00:10:58,143
- We're free!
- We're free!

173
00:11:00,068 --> 00:11:02,854
- Are we a team then?
- The four of us are a team?

174
00:11:02,855 --> 00:11:05,658
<i>No, but since you have no intelligence,
Dorothy and her brother...</i>

175
00:11:05,659 --> 00:11:08,031
He's not the brother.
Isn't he Toto? Toto, the dog?

176
00:11:08,446 --> 00:11:10,898
Isn't he supposed to be the dog
for the day?

177
00:11:10,899 --> 00:11:12,514
- No, he's her brother.
- Dorothy's brother?

178
00:11:12,833 --> 00:11:14,407
- Since you're lacking intelligence...
- He's Toto.

179
00:11:14,408 --> 00:11:17,807
<i>They're going to take you to see the wizard
so that you can find your intelligence.</i>

180
00:11:17,808 --> 00:11:19,757
I really hope that it's someplace warm.

181
00:11:19,758 --> 00:11:24,057
Okay, then we'll cast a spell for you.
A spell to turn that bike into a car.

182
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:26,170
[First... turn the bike into a car.]

183
00:11:26,171 --> 00:11:31,176
- So that the bike can turn into a car.
- Bicycle... turn yourself into a car!

184
00:11:34,379 --> 00:11:36,246
One, two, three!

185
00:11:38,793 --> 00:11:41,555
Ta da!
It's been transformed into a car!

186
00:11:41,556 --> 00:11:44,217
[Getting into the bicycle that they've
magically transformed into a car...]

187
00:11:44,218 --> 00:11:47,093
- That's usually my spot.
- You can drive, Yoo Jung.

188
00:11:47,397 --> 00:11:50,252
[How absurd... she's only 14 years old!]

189
00:11:50,253 --> 00:11:52,548
Let's all pray for Yoo Jung to
get her license right now!

190
00:11:52,549 --> 00:11:54,700
Let's all pray for it!

191
00:11:57,446 --> 00:12:01,155
<i>You will now be given a test to
control your heart.</i>

192
00:12:01,156 --> 00:12:05,579
<i>The tin woodsmen who were in a quest to earn
their hearts cannot be surprised at any event.</i>

193
00:12:06,724 --> 00:12:08,210
[Bomb...]

194
00:12:08,565 --> 00:12:11,997
<i>Tin woodsman Je Moon, Tin woodsman Jae Suk,
and Tin woodsman Gary</i>

195
00:12:11,998 --> 00:12:15,395
<i>started a competition amongst themselves in
order to learn how to control their hearts.</i>

196
00:12:17,184 --> 00:12:19,292
<i>You have one minute on the clock.</i>

197
00:12:19,293 --> 00:12:22,429
[Heart control? One minute on the clock-
Play on the last letter of the word.]

198
00:12:22,957 --> 00:12:24,547
Suk-tan. (Coal)

199
00:12:25,497 --> 00:12:26,979
Tan-Kwang. (Coal mine)

200
00:12:28,157 --> 00:12:29,877
Kwang-san. (Mine)

201
00:12:31,978 --> 00:12:33,298
San-wool-lim. (Echo in the hills)

202
00:12:35,811 --> 00:12:38,111
- Lim?
- You can play off of 'Im'.

203
00:12:38,112 --> 00:12:39,589
Im-kkyukjeong.

204
00:12:43,995 --> 00:12:45,879
[Unable to think of anything?]

205
00:12:45,879 --> 00:12:47,405
Jung-boon.

206
00:12:48,085 --> 00:12:50,559
[Huh?]

207
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,250
Boon-jang-sil.
Did you say, Jung-boon?

208
00:12:54,877 --> 00:12:56,488
Sil-jang. (Mounting)

209
00:12:58,411 --> 00:13:01,130
Jang?
Jang-bagu-ni. (Grocery bag)

210
00:13:02,381 --> 00:13:03,629
Ni?

211
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:05,274
- Ni?
- Yes, 'Ni'.

212
00:13:06,585 --> 00:13:07,902
Ni...

213
00:13:07,903 --> 00:13:09,756
I have no idea what
you're going to come up with.

214
00:13:10,572 --> 00:13:12,811
All I can think of is swear words.

215
00:13:19,041 --> 00:13:20,786
- Ni-ce. (City in France)
- Nice?

216
00:13:23,231 --> 00:13:24,704
Stock-holm.

217
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:27,546
[Holm?]

218
00:13:28,628 --> 00:13:30,147
- Holm?
- Holm.

219
00:13:31,442 --> 00:13:34,321
There's nothing.
You should just...

220
00:13:39,995 --> 00:13:41,644
Why was the explosion so big?

221
00:13:42,052 --> 00:13:43,947
Even Je Moon was really startled.

222
00:13:46,528 --> 00:13:47,647
What do we do now?

223
00:13:48,054 --> 00:13:49,971
Do we have to go get everyone else?

224
00:13:50,373 --> 00:13:52,826
- We have to find the wizard, I think.
- Right?

225
00:13:52,827 --> 00:13:54,815
[Must find the wizard...]

226
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,724
What about the Tiger?
Isn't there a cowardly lion?

227
00:13:57,725 --> 00:14:00,642
You're right.
I think Jong Kook is the lion.

228
00:14:00,957 --> 00:14:02,952
- The cowardly lion.
- And the tin robot.

229
00:14:02,953 --> 00:14:04,769
Right, the tin robot.

230
00:14:06,272 --> 00:14:10,274
Ah... so we all have to group together
and find our way to the wizard?

231
00:14:10,662 --> 00:14:12,877
I guess we're going to have
to pick them up.

232
00:14:13,214 --> 00:14:17,147
No matter how I look at it...
I think we have to go get them.

233
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:23,689
And I know that TOP...
he's quite the prankster.

234
00:14:24,344 --> 00:14:27,040
What do you think we should do?
Just let them get in the car?

235
00:14:27,041 --> 00:14:30,106
- No, we can't just let them in the car.
- Let's leave that up to TOP.

236
00:14:30,107 --> 00:14:31,828
Since it's pretty cold outside...

237
00:14:32,328 --> 00:14:34,394
We can't let them in the car
too easily.

238
00:14:35,235 --> 00:14:38,287
[Wow... what a prankster.]

239
00:14:38,288 --> 00:14:42,777
- Let's torment them as much as we can.
- You really are an awful person sometimes.

240
00:14:42,778 --> 00:14:44,469
There's no room for sympathy.

241
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:48,326
[Absolutely no hint of intelligence.
Two scarecrows suit each other well.]

242
00:14:50,187 --> 00:14:52,747
- What is this? They're here?
- What is this? This place is really cool.

243
00:14:53,127 --> 00:14:55,290
[Jeonsun 'S' Exhibit.]

244
00:14:55,291 --> 00:14:58,998
[An old coal cultural complex.]

245
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:03,035
- What the heck?
- What is that?

246
00:15:04,012 --> 00:15:05,278
There are three of them?

247
00:15:06,676 --> 00:15:07,990
Someone's coming.

248
00:15:07,991 --> 00:15:09,692
[The three people are a sight to
laugh at even from a distance.]

249
00:15:09,693 --> 00:15:11,614
I don't think all three of us are going
to be able to get in it.

250
00:15:13,504 --> 00:15:14,947
What is this?

251
00:15:14,948 --> 00:15:17,301
- What is this?
- What are you guys?

252
00:15:17,302 --> 00:15:19,704
What are you guys?
Are you tin robots?

253
00:15:19,705 --> 00:15:21,612
What are you supposed to be?
Sancho?

254
00:15:23,074 --> 00:15:25,242
It's Yoo Jung and TOP.

255
00:15:25,243 --> 00:15:28,343
[Fascinated by the sight of Dorothy Yoo Jung,
and her Brother TOP alighting from the car.]

256
00:15:30,738 --> 00:15:34,220
- What are you guys dressed in?
- This is so embarrassing!

257
00:15:34,221 --> 00:15:36,215
- This is seriously embarrassing.
- What are you doing here, Yoo Jung?

258
00:15:36,216 --> 00:15:38,769
- What are you doing here?
- Yoo Jung is Dorothy.

259
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:41,735
- Yoo Jung is Dorothy?
- You can't cross these tracks.

260
00:15:41,736 --> 00:15:43,953
- Why? Why not?
- No, you can't cross the tracks.

261
00:15:43,954 --> 00:15:46,363
- It's very nice to meet you.
- Don't cross the tracks!

262
00:15:46,364 --> 00:15:49,172
[Greeting each other happily with
the railroad tracks between them.]

263
00:15:49,173 --> 00:15:51,713
How do you expect me to look like this
with TOP hanging around me?

264
00:15:51,714 --> 00:15:53,573
What's going on here?
Yoo Jung looks so pretty.

265
00:15:53,574 --> 00:15:56,206
You three look like a group of Idols
dressed in your stage costume from afar.

266
00:15:56,739 --> 00:15:58,728
[Group name- Tin Woodsman Boys?]

267
00:15:58,729 --> 00:16:00,332
How many of these three?

268
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:03,076
- One.
- Just one of you can get in that car.

269
00:16:03,716 --> 00:16:05,464
And as for the other two...

270
00:16:07,545 --> 00:16:10,797
[Woodman Je Moon thinking that he is
undoubtedly the person to get chosen.]

271
00:16:10,798 --> 00:16:13,074
- You have to step back.
- This is unbelievable.

272
00:16:14,026 --> 00:16:16,489
- Why do we have to get chosen by you guys?
- This is seriously ridiculous.

273
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:18,396
- This is absurd.
- They chose both of you?

274
00:16:18,397 --> 00:16:20,764
- Yes.
- Why did you choose both of them?

275
00:16:20,765 --> 00:16:23,942
- They chose both of us right away.
- Do you know how hard we had to work?

276
00:16:24,219 --> 00:16:25,749
How hard do you think
we worked to win them over?

277
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:27,165
For them to choose both of us?

278
00:16:27,166 --> 00:16:30,271
Those two over there...
You two are seriously getting on my nerves.

279
00:16:30,272 --> 00:16:32,092
- I don't like either one of you.
- Did you just point your fingers at me?

280
00:16:32,093 --> 00:16:33,466
- Did you?
- That's right! I did!

281
00:16:33,467 --> 00:16:36,650
- You dare point your finger at me?
- I'm going to come and drag you over here.

282
00:16:37,159 --> 00:16:38,920
You think you can do that to me?

283
00:16:38,921 --> 00:16:41,726
- When I'm already over here?
- You're the only one who needs to get lost!

284
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:44,086
[Tin woodsman Jae Suk and Scarecrow Ha Ha-
Itching to tear each other apart.]

285
00:16:44,087 --> 00:16:49,386
There's the dance portion, acrostic poem
and personal performance, right?

286
00:16:49,387 --> 00:16:53,116
- They have to do all that, right?
- What kind of absurdity is that?

287
00:16:53,117 --> 00:16:55,422
- You need to keep it down over there.
- Seriously.

288
00:16:55,423 --> 00:16:58,052
You'd better be careful.
Je Moon has his eye on you right now.

289
00:16:58,053 --> 00:16:59,398
- That's right.
- Got it?

290
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:02,350
Don't try to put ideas in his head!
If you do, we'll just take him right now!

291
00:17:02,351 --> 00:17:04,328
- I'm going to come over there right now!
- You can't step over the tracks!

292
00:17:04,966 --> 00:17:06,524
[Huh?]

293
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:08,715
You can't cross the tracks like that!

294
00:17:08,716 --> 00:17:10,292
[Everyone seems to want to
cross the tracks.]

295
00:17:10,954 --> 00:17:12,390
We're all like zombies!

296
00:17:12,391 --> 00:17:14,189
[Zombies?]

297
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:16,095
- I don't even have a heart right now.
- We're zombies.

298
00:17:17,342 --> 00:17:19,356
Let's start with the acrostic poem first.

299
00:17:19,357 --> 00:17:23,076
We'll tell you what your word is.
Gary, your word is, 'Dong-chang-sang'.

300
00:17:23,330 --> 00:17:26,180
- Je Moon's word is... 'Run-ning-man'.
- His word is Kim Yoo Jung.

301
00:17:26,181 --> 00:17:28,828
Okay, his word can be Kim Yoo Jung.
And Jae Suk, we're not going to tell you.

302
00:17:30,446 --> 00:17:32,294
This is ridiculous.
Absolutely ridiculous.

303
00:17:32,295 --> 00:17:34,270
This is really ridiculous.

304
00:17:35,848 --> 00:17:37,336
Seriously.
I'm getting so annoyed right now.

305
00:17:38,001 --> 00:17:40,777
Why don't you start, Gary?
Remember, your word is, 'dong-chang-sang'.

306
00:17:40,812 --> 00:17:42,537
[Gary to start the acrostic poem.]

307
00:17:42,538 --> 00:17:45,050
- Dong!
- You are all animals! ('dong-mul'=animals.)

308
00:17:45,051 --> 00:17:46,430
There you go.
You're doing great.

309
00:17:46,818 --> 00:17:48,246
Chang!

310
00:17:48,247 --> 00:17:50,421
I'm going to pierce you with this spear!
('chang'= spear.)

311
00:17:50,421 --> 00:17:51,941
There you go.
You're doing great.

312
00:17:54,014 --> 00:17:56,762
- Sang!
- I'm going to eat you alive!!

313
00:17:56,763 --> 00:17:58,290
('sang'=alive).

314
00:17:58,291 --> 00:17:59,810
You guys!

315
00:18:00,407 --> 00:18:02,207
I'm going to eat you all alive!

316
00:18:02,827 --> 00:18:05,092
Okay.
First of all... that wasn't too bad.

317
00:18:05,093 --> 00:18:06,349
Okay, Kim Yoo Jung.

318
00:18:07,035 --> 00:18:08,411
Kim!

319
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:11,925
Hey, Kim Yoo Jung!

320
00:18:11,926 --> 00:18:14,391
- He startled me.
- Is he trying to copy what Gary did?

321
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:17,668
- What do you mean, copy?
- One, two, three. 'Yoo'!

322
00:18:18,612 --> 00:18:20,251
Hey, Yoo Jung!

323
00:18:20,252 --> 00:18:23,271
That's not bad, Je Moon.
That's pretty good.

324
00:18:23,272 --> 00:18:25,317
[A new twist on the acrostic poem.]

325
00:18:26,907 --> 00:18:28,135
Jung!

326
00:18:29,094 --> 00:18:31,105
I hope you don't fall in love!
('Jung-boon"=affection, love.)

327
00:18:31,901 --> 00:18:34,926
- What are you saying?
- She's only 15 years old right now.

328
00:18:34,927 --> 00:18:37,327
- What are you saying?
- She's a teenager.

329
00:18:37,328 --> 00:18:41,122
It's just that he used that word earlier
when we were playing our previous game.

330
00:18:41,123 --> 00:18:42,989
How could you say that to her?

331
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:44,545
- Over!
- Okay.

332
00:18:44,546 --> 00:18:46,133
For Jae Suk...

333
00:18:46,134 --> 00:18:48,662
- You have to do whatever TOP tells you.
- Okay.

334
00:18:48,903 --> 00:18:50,297
I'm confident I can do it.

335
00:18:50,627 --> 00:18:51,855
Give me what you've got.
Come on.

336
00:18:51,856 --> 00:18:53,976
- It could be a 15 syllable word.
- Try me.

337
00:18:54,305 --> 00:18:56,787
[Overly confident Tin Woodman Jae Suk.]

338
00:18:56,788 --> 00:18:58,727
- Fine, take it then.
- Give it to me.

339
00:18:58,728 --> 00:19:00,635
- Do it. Give it to me.
- Then give it a try.

340
00:19:00,921 --> 00:19:02,856
[Just what will TOP give out as his word?]

341
00:19:02,857 --> 00:19:04,543
Top!

342
00:19:06,253 --> 00:19:07,499
Top?

343
00:19:09,246 --> 00:19:11,823
[One simple word... 'Top'.]

344
00:19:11,824 --> 00:19:13,598
Top-cheo!
(A play on the word, 'shut up'.)

345
00:19:15,222 --> 00:19:17,813
[He's telling them to shove it.]

346
00:19:19,097 --> 00:19:22,426
- Listen you jerks! Just shut it!
- Jae Suk!

347
00:19:22,427 --> 00:19:25,791
- You shut it right now!
- It's over! It's over for you!

348
00:19:25,792 --> 00:19:27,616
- Over!
- I know that it's over for me!

349
00:19:28,365 --> 00:19:30,378
That was such a sneaky play.
Top? That's what you had?

350
00:19:30,762 --> 00:19:32,832
Forget it.
We've made our decision.

351
00:19:32,833 --> 00:19:36,761
[Just who did they choose?]

352
00:19:36,762 --> 00:19:37,884
Fine, make your decision!

353
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:40,022
- We're going to choose two people.
- What!

354
00:19:40,023 --> 00:19:41,985
- Two people.
- We've had a sudden change of heart.

355
00:19:41,986 --> 00:19:44,327
- You're going to choose two people?
- Then I know that he's out.

356
00:19:46,278 --> 00:19:48,811
[Jae Suk is undoubtedly the one
to be disqualified?]

357
00:19:53,979 --> 00:19:55,831
- Hey, you're choosing two people?
- You two did great!

358
00:19:55,832 --> 00:19:57,914
Hey, Dorothy!
Hey!

359
00:19:58,602 --> 00:20:00,478
- Hey!
- Bye! See you later.

360
00:20:00,479 --> 00:20:02,666
- Bye.
- Woodsman Gae! You're leaving me here?

361
00:20:03,344 --> 00:20:05,991
Hey, Dorothy! TOP!
You guys are just going to leave like this?

362
00:20:05,992 --> 00:20:09,607
Hey!
Wow... unbelievable.

363
00:20:09,608 --> 00:20:12,150
Fine!
This means war!

364
00:20:12,365 --> 00:20:14,118
- This means war!
- This is war!

365
00:20:14,119 --> 00:20:16,460
Look at the way he looks over there.
He really looks so pathetic.

366
00:20:16,461 --> 00:20:18,038
I'm so pissed!

367
00:20:19,697 --> 00:20:21,029
Ugh, I'm so pissed!

368
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:24,598
[Thus, the heartless Tin Woodsman Jae Suk
is left all alone steaming in his anger.]

369
00:20:25,068 --> 00:20:27,183
[They ultimately allow Jae Suk to ride along,
and they're now headed elsewhere...]

370
00:20:27,183 --> 00:20:28,746
But I haven't seen Suk Jin anywhere.

371
00:20:28,746 --> 00:20:31,707
- What do you think Suk Jin is?
- I wonder if Suk Jin is the wizard.

372
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:34,279
- Why would Suk Jin be the wizard?
- You don't think?

373
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:37,032
You don't think we're filming this episode
without him, do you?

374
00:20:41,874 --> 00:20:43,195
There they are.

375
00:20:43,196 --> 00:20:45,467
[Jeongsun's 'D' forest lodge.]

376
00:20:46,413 --> 00:20:49,124
But I bet they aren't that cold since
they're dressed in those furry costumes.

377
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:51,040
- They're dressed in furry costumes?
- Yeah.

378
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:52,615
Since they're lions.

379
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:57,191
Look, it's a tin man.

380
00:20:57,192 --> 00:20:58,958
Why are there so many tin men?

381
00:20:59,604 --> 00:21:01,671
- Scarecrows.
- They're scarecrows!

382
00:21:01,672 --> 00:21:03,317
Why are there so many tin men?

383
00:21:03,964 --> 00:21:06,709
Yoon Je Moon is the headmaster
for this traveling circus.

384
00:21:08,311 --> 00:21:10,145
- Hello.
- Hello.

385
00:21:10,146 --> 00:21:13,173
We came because we are in need of some
animals for our traveling circus act.

386
00:21:13,199 --> 00:21:16,159
We can't be in a circus act.
We're too afraid.

387
00:21:16,195 --> 00:21:17,926
- This is Dorothy.
- Dorothy!

388
00:21:17,927 --> 00:21:21,701
- Hi, Dorothy! I can't believe it's Dorothy.
- This is Dorothy's brother.

389
00:21:21,702 --> 00:21:24,242
- There is no brother!
- What did you say?

390
00:21:24,243 --> 00:21:26,614
- She doesn't have a brother!
- Have you ever been over to Dorothy's house?

391
00:21:26,973 --> 00:21:30,194
- Dorothy doesn't have a brother.
- He's a brother from a different relation.

392
00:21:31,878 --> 00:21:34,432
- Does she just think of him as a brother?
- Dorothy's brother, 'Doto'.

393
00:21:35,175 --> 00:21:37,875
- Doto. His name is Doto.
- Are you sure they're not just friends?

394
00:21:38,204 --> 00:21:42,231
- Why are you holding onto an ax?
- We're cowardly lions.

395
00:21:42,232 --> 00:21:44,391
- It's because we're afraid.
- We got that, so set down the ax.

396
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:48,082
That lioness looks like she just
woke up from a nap or something.

397
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,472
She looks like she's been sleeping.

398
00:21:51,473 --> 00:21:54,621
Anyway, Dorothy and her brother, Doto...

399
00:21:54,865 --> 00:21:58,199
- they can only take one of you with them.
- What did you say?

400
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,960
- Only one of you can come with us.
- Why?

401
00:21:59,961 --> 00:22:01,576
The other one has to stay here forever.

402
00:22:02,115 --> 00:22:04,612
The person that doesn't get picked
has to team up with Ji Suk Jin.

403
00:22:05,022 --> 00:22:07,635
- In that case...
- Let's do an acrostic poem.

404
00:22:07,636 --> 00:22:09,431
- Let's do the word, 'sa-ja' (lion)
- That's good.

405
00:22:09,432 --> 00:22:10,894
Sa.

406
00:22:11,788 --> 00:22:14,037
- Sa!
- Sa.

407
00:22:14,641 --> 00:22:17,041
- I'm telling you to buy me. ('sa'=buy).
- Ja.

408
00:22:17,042 --> 00:22:18,242
Ja!
('Ja'=here)

409
00:22:20,968 --> 00:22:23,182
Buy me right now.
Buy!

410
00:22:23,183 --> 00:22:24,926
Okay, next.
Blank Ji Hyo.

411
00:22:24,927 --> 00:22:26,247
Sa!

412
00:22:26,248 --> 00:22:28,771
- Ja.
- Ja! Ja!

413
00:22:30,108 --> 00:22:32,287
- How much? How much will it be?
- Why are you copying me?

414
00:22:33,921 --> 00:22:35,941
[Love-struck woodsman, Gary.
An immediate reaction to Blank Ji's poem.]

415
00:22:35,942 --> 00:22:37,765
I have to buy while I have the chance.

416
00:22:42,048 --> 00:22:45,012
[Dorothy and her expeditioners
are finally all gathered together.]

417
00:22:48,853 --> 00:22:50,510
Suk Jin really is nowhere to be seen.

418
00:22:50,511 --> 00:22:52,577
<i>I see that you all are finally
gathered together.</i>

419
00:22:52,577 --> 00:22:56,494
<i>The siblings who want to go back home,
intelligence seeking scarecrows</i>

420
00:22:56,632 --> 00:23:00,192
<i>tin woodsmen in search for a heart,
and courage seeking lions.</i>

421
00:23:00,193 --> 00:23:03,526
<i>Come find me if you have a wish
that you want to have come true.</i>

422
00:23:04,126 --> 00:23:06,650
<i>If you succeed your group mission</i>

423
00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:09,966
<i>you will win yourselves an item that will
help you in your quest to find the wizard.</i>

424
00:23:09,967 --> 00:23:11,097
Seriously?

425
00:23:11,098 --> 00:23:14,533
<i>You can change out of your clothes and
we will now start your mission for the quest.</i>

426
00:23:14,534 --> 00:23:16,854
- Okay.
- Let's go!

427
00:23:16,855 --> 00:23:18,389
[Let's get started on
this world of adventure!]

428
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:22,111
They made you suffer for nothing when we all
just needed to get in that car together.

429
00:23:22,111 --> 00:23:23,871
Je Moon is really angry right now.

430
00:23:23,872 --> 00:23:25,833
You'd better watch yourself
right now.

431
00:23:30,714 --> 00:23:33,865
[Just then...]

432
00:23:36,175 --> 00:23:39,443
What is this? I came here by accident.
This is a radish field.

433
00:23:39,444 --> 00:23:42,279
Ugh, seriously!
I keep making mistakes.

434
00:23:42,681 --> 00:23:46,071
Oo-sa! Let's disappear.
Big-nose power!

435
00:23:48,309 --> 00:23:53,397
[Target destination is right here.]

436
00:23:53,398 --> 00:23:55,097
Ugh, seriously!

437
00:23:55,098 --> 00:23:56,737
I keep making mistakes.

438
00:23:58,205 --> 00:24:00,762
[Finally...]

439
00:24:00,763 --> 00:24:02,374
I came to the right place this time!

440
00:24:03,188 --> 00:24:05,929
[Come to me, Dorothy and friends...]

441
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:11,179
- Okay, let's get going.
- Let's go.

442
00:24:11,999 --> 00:24:13,943
Is Suk Jin really the wizard?

443
00:24:13,978 --> 00:24:16,171
- I wonder why Suk Jin is the wizard.
- What?

444
00:24:16,767 --> 00:24:19,661
- Where are we going right now?
- I'm not sure.

445
00:24:19,662 --> 00:24:22,681
[Where are they headed...]

446
00:24:22,682 --> 00:24:24,807
We're supposed to go to
some restaurant.

447
00:24:24,808 --> 00:24:26,381
This is the place.

448
00:24:28,023 --> 00:24:29,462
We're here.

449
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,817
This isn't a restaurant.

450
00:24:34,079 --> 00:24:37,392
[A place clouded in mysterious energy...]

451
00:24:39,597 --> 00:24:43,268
[Will they be able to meet
Wizard Big-nose at this place?]

452
00:24:44,603 --> 00:24:46,535
[Just then...]

453
00:24:46,536 --> 00:24:48,840
[A message magically appears
on Jae Suk's cellphone.]

454
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:51,025
<i>Welcome to your first adventure.</i>

455
00:24:51,026 --> 00:24:52,349
It's Suk Jin.

456
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:55,672
[Wizard Big-nose is watching Dorothy
and her friends through his magical portal.]

457
00:24:55,673 --> 00:24:57,735
Don't get out of the car,
and look next to you

458
00:24:57,736 --> 00:24:59,648
and you'll see another car
parked there.

459
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:02,830
I have placed a curse on that car

460
00:25:02,831 --> 00:25:06,203
and you'll find that there are nine
magical canes stuck on that car.

461
00:25:06,685 --> 00:25:09,177
Each and every one of you must
grab onto one of those canes

462
00:25:09,178 --> 00:25:12,699
and every one of you must board
that car within your allotted time

463
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:16,104
and shut the car door behind you
for the curse to be lifted.

464
00:25:16,105 --> 00:25:20,623
I will give you something that would be of
use if you can complete your mission on time.

465
00:25:20,624 --> 00:25:25,560
You must do whatever it takes
to get past this hurdle.

466
00:25:29,958 --> 00:25:32,146
What did he say?
What is that?

467
00:25:32,147 --> 00:25:34,378
- What did he say? What is that?
- Is that it?

468
00:25:34,379 --> 00:25:35,947
[Wizard Big-nose's first hurdle is revealed.]

469
00:25:38,287 --> 00:25:41,120
[Magical plunger canes.]

470
00:25:41,253 --> 00:25:43,173
[The same place, one hour ago.]

471
00:25:43,174 --> 00:25:45,627
Magical car, appear!

472
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:55,997
Nine magical canes... appear!

473
00:25:58,251 --> 00:25:59,579
Okay!

474
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:02,178
[His magic seems to be
working well for him today?]

475
00:26:02,943 --> 00:26:05,157
Okay, my magical canes are ready.

476
00:26:05,682 --> 00:26:07,540
Okay, Big-nose power!

477
00:26:07,541 --> 00:26:09,794
Magical canes,
attach yourselves to the car!

478
00:26:14,285 --> 00:26:15,870
Hey, hurry up and stick them on there.

479
00:26:16,864 --> 00:26:21,452
[Magic apprentices are all suffering from
having met an incapable wizard master.]

480
00:26:22,850 --> 00:26:24,260
Okay!

481
00:26:24,261 --> 00:26:26,280
They're all on there now!

482
00:26:28,666 --> 00:26:30,022
They are all really stuck on there!

483
00:26:30,023 --> 00:26:32,377
They really are magical canes!

484
00:26:33,686 --> 00:26:37,000
[These are...]

485
00:26:37,001 --> 00:26:39,467
[Magical mission that Big-nose wizard
has prepared for them himself.]

486
00:26:39,468 --> 00:26:41,679
<i>Within 30 seconds...</i>

487
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,611
<i>all of you must get in the
car with a cane</i>

488
00:26:43,612 --> 00:26:46,326
<i>and close the door behind you
in order for you to succeed your mission.</i>

489
00:26:46,327 --> 00:26:47,940
- Inside that car?
- Seriously.

490
00:26:47,941 --> 00:26:50,178
- We're not getting in that car?
- No, we're getting back in this car.

491
00:26:50,179 --> 00:26:51,485
- We're getting in this car?
- We have to get back in this car.

492
00:26:51,486 --> 00:26:53,304
How are all nine of us to fit in that car?

493
00:26:53,305 --> 00:26:56,000
<i>No, you're getting in the other car.
You have to get in the white car.</i>

494
00:26:56,001 --> 00:26:58,474
- What did you say?
- You have to get in the white car.

495
00:26:58,475 --> 00:26:59,970
- You want us to get in the other car?
- In that white car?

496
00:26:59,971 --> 00:27:03,246
[The idea is so absurd
that all they can do is laugh.]

497
00:27:03,247 --> 00:27:05,159
How are nine of us
supposed to get in that car?

498
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:08,900
<i>We did a test trial with our staff,
and they succeeded in under 30 seconds.</i>

499
00:27:08,901 --> 00:27:11,284
- Is everyone ready?
- Yes. We have to move quickly, okay?

500
00:27:21,844 --> 00:27:24,135
[There's no need for you
to be that serious...]

501
00:27:24,136 --> 00:27:28,622
[The glint in his eyes alone is enough
to pull the plungers off the car.]

502
00:27:30,004 --> 00:27:33,650
[Big-nose Wizard's first trial- Start!]

503
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:37,315
-You have to move faster!
- You have to hurry, Je Moon!

504
00:27:41,537 --> 00:27:44,535
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

505
00:27:44,614 --> 00:27:48,381
[Cold glint Je Moon's attempt at pulling the
plunger off isn't going as well as he hoped.]

506
00:27:48,382 --> 00:27:49,824
I can't pull it off!

507
00:27:49,825 --> 00:27:51,307
You have to pull it off the car!

508
00:27:54,731 --> 00:27:56,117
Come on, Je Moon!

509
00:28:00,801 --> 00:28:03,178
[No time for laughter! The next
person must hurry out for their turn!]

510
00:28:03,179 --> 00:28:06,237
You have to move faster, Je Moon!
Like this!

511
00:28:06,749 --> 00:28:08,326
[Yoo Hyuk pulls his off with one yank.]

512
00:28:09,541 --> 00:28:11,327
[Huh?]

513
00:28:11,328 --> 00:28:13,747
There's a door in the back!
Why are you getting in that way?

514
00:28:14,297 --> 00:28:17,094
[Cold glint Je Moon insisting on making
things more difficult for himself.]

515
00:28:17,095 --> 00:28:19,248
- There's a door in the back?
- Of course, there is!

516
00:28:19,324 --> 00:28:21,546
[Kkuk also pulls it off on his first try.]

517
00:28:25,992 --> 00:28:27,257
Come in this way.

518
00:28:29,391 --> 00:28:31,644
Pull yourself in more.
Turn your body sideways.

519
00:28:32,663 --> 00:28:34,664
Turn your body sideways.
There you go. Turn.

520
00:28:35,619 --> 00:28:38,257
[Where did that glint in Je Moon's eyes
from earlier go?]

521
00:28:39,625 --> 00:28:41,128
- Do I need to get in the back?
- Hurry!

522
00:28:41,129 --> 00:28:43,483
- You have to get in the backseat.
- Hurry up and get in!

523
00:28:43,484 --> 00:28:45,553
- Just get in!
- How am I supposed to get in there?

524
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:48,419
[Just cram in...]

525
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:54,558
Just fold yourself in.

526
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:56,779
[Already packed to the brim.]

527
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:00,247
[Blank Ji also gets it in one try.]

528
00:29:03,749 --> 00:29:06,157
[Excited Dorothy Yoo Jung.]

529
00:29:06,495 --> 00:29:07,688
Get in the front seat, Yoo Jung.

530
00:29:07,689 --> 00:29:09,970
[They have to move quickly...]

531
00:29:09,971 --> 00:29:11,492
Get in the driver's seat.

532
00:29:12,925 --> 00:29:15,565
[Dorothy Yoo Jung burrowing her way into the
driver's seat with her tiny frame.]

533
00:29:15,566 --> 00:29:18,080
[Gary is trying to follow her lead...]

534
00:29:18,081 --> 00:29:20,068
- I can't close the door!
- You have to shut the door!

535
00:29:20,069 --> 00:29:22,320
- I can't shut it!
- Shut it on yourself if you have to!

536
00:29:22,321 --> 00:29:25,610
Your butt!
Your butt's in the way!

537
00:29:25,611 --> 00:29:28,330
Your butt!
Your butt's in the way!

538
00:29:28,331 --> 00:29:30,260
[Gary's butt is in the way of
closing the car door.]

539
00:29:30,261 --> 00:29:32,702
- Your butt!
- The door is now shut!

540
00:29:33,102 --> 00:29:36,042
[Everyone is in the car!]

541
00:29:36,851 --> 00:29:38,726
<i>Okay, your time is...</i>

542
00:29:38,727 --> 00:29:42,228
<i>One minute and 41 seconds.</i>

543
00:29:42,229 --> 00:29:43,784
[One minute and 41 seconds!]

544
00:29:46,398 --> 00:29:48,291
[The cold glint in his has completely
dissipated after a round of the first game.]

545
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:51,208
Je Moon!

546
00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:54,116
You have to pull it off
on your first try, Je Moon.

547
00:29:54,117 --> 00:29:55,308
[Je Moon seems to be the likely culprit
for their failure for the first attempt?]

548
00:29:55,343 --> 00:29:57,182
It took you longer to pull off your plunger
than it took Yoo Jung.

549
00:29:58,706 --> 00:30:01,448
Je Moon, there's a backdoor too.

550
00:30:02,694 --> 00:30:06,858
[Je Moon...
he may be the new black hole.]

551
00:30:08,069 --> 00:30:11,319
- We all have to rush out in succession.
- One right after another.

552
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:14,209
Je Moon has to be faster.

553
00:30:14,210 --> 00:30:16,541
- I'm sorry, but you need to be faster.
- Okay, I got it. Fighting!

554
00:30:19,675 --> 00:30:23,708
[Totally trying to override
Coach Kkuk's nagging.]

555
00:30:23,709 --> 00:30:26,474
- I don't think he liked what I had to say.
- Je Moon doesn't like to be nagged.

556
00:30:26,475 --> 00:30:28,541
- No, he doesn't seem to like that.
- Fighting!

557
00:30:28,542 --> 00:30:30,806
You just wait and see. I'm positive
that he'll be much better now.

558
00:30:32,197 --> 00:30:36,244
[Magical cane- Second attempt.]

559
00:30:36,245 --> 00:30:37,383
Nice!

560
00:30:38,291 --> 00:30:39,559
[Again!]

561
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:41,144
[Thrown on his back.]

562
00:30:41,145 --> 00:30:44,035
Why does he keep doing that?
Why is he using his foot?

563
00:30:44,036 --> 00:30:46,191
[But Je Moon still bounces right back up
to avoid being nagged at by Jong Kook.]

564
00:30:46,574 --> 00:30:48,201
How am I supposed to
open the door in the back?

565
00:30:48,202 --> 00:30:50,325
How am I supposed to
open the door in the back?

566
00:30:53,749 --> 00:30:56,659
[Unable to open the backdoor again,
and tries to squeeze through the front.]

567
00:31:00,749 --> 00:31:03,865
- I told you about the door earlier.
- I didn't see the door handle!

568
00:31:04,524 --> 00:31:06,928
We have to squeeze in closer.
Scoot your body even more!

569
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,415
- A little more!
- Is this enough?

570
00:31:11,569 --> 00:31:13,575
[Blank Ji easily pulls off the
magical cane from the car.]

571
00:31:13,576 --> 00:31:15,804
[Wait! That's not the right door!]

572
00:31:18,734 --> 00:31:21,642
Be careful when you shut the door!

573
00:31:25,287 --> 00:31:28,179
[The mission will be complete as soon as
Blank Ji and Dorothy Yoo Jung gets in!]

574
00:31:30,377 --> 00:31:32,079
Shut it!
Shut the door!

575
00:31:33,412 --> 00:31:37,113
[All nine members are in!]

576
00:31:37,114 --> 00:31:39,089
Open the door!
Open the door for us.

577
00:31:39,090 --> 00:31:41,873
- Open the door.
- Save me! Please save me!

578
00:31:41,969 --> 00:31:44,244
- How many seconds?
- Where's the door handle?

579
00:31:44,245 --> 00:31:46,405
[First attempt was one minute 41 seconds.
This was faster than the first try...]

580
00:31:46,406 --> 00:31:48,925
[Did they pass?]

581
00:31:48,926 --> 00:31:51,003
<i>52 seconds.</i>

582
00:31:51,004 --> 00:31:54,497
[Second attempt- 52 seconds. Fail.]

583
00:31:54,498 --> 00:31:57,467
- Seriously, Je Moon.
- I told you earlier, Je Moon.

584
00:31:57,468 --> 00:32:00,442
You told me that you knew!
The handle is right here.

585
00:32:00,443 --> 00:32:02,614
- This is it?
- The door handle is right here.

586
00:32:03,826 --> 00:32:07,215
- Why are you pulling it off with your foot?
- I can't pull it off with just my hands.

587
00:32:08,405 --> 00:32:10,647
There's a dent in the car door.

588
00:32:11,049 --> 00:32:12,729
[Je Moon's footprint.]

589
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:14,261
Je Moon did it.

590
00:32:14,916 --> 00:32:17,359
- What?
- The car's a bit dented.

591
00:32:21,017 --> 00:32:24,696
[Je Moon takes a closer look...]

592
00:32:25,187 --> 00:32:27,254
- No, I didn't do that.
- What do you mean, you didn't?

593
00:32:27,255 --> 00:32:30,097
What do you mean, you didn't?
That was definitely you!

594
00:32:30,098 --> 00:32:31,664
You're the one who did it.

595
00:32:32,682 --> 00:32:35,380
[Charismatic Je Moon.
A new cutie pie on the scene.]

596
00:32:35,381 --> 00:32:38,350
- Seriously.
- I really want to succeed this time.

597
00:32:38,351 --> 00:32:41,508
- What if we fail the mission?
- If we fail, then we won't get the hint.

598
00:32:41,509 --> 00:32:43,240
- Seriously.
- Then do we just go home?

599
00:32:44,993 --> 00:32:47,173
Are you trying to fail on purpose now?

600
00:32:47,174 --> 00:32:49,807
[Is Je Moon activating his homing device?]

601
00:32:49,808 --> 00:32:51,475
- I'm really trying to succeed.
- Okay.

602
00:32:53,319 --> 00:32:57,001
[Yoo Hyuk positioning himself to be faster
even if it's by a mere second.]

603
00:32:57,568 --> 00:33:00,172
My position is looking very
weird on camera.

604
00:33:02,623 --> 00:33:04,747
- You're doing that on purpose, aren't you?
- No, I'm not!

605
00:33:04,748 --> 00:33:07,035
- You love showing off your butt!
- Stop doing that.

606
00:33:08,526 --> 00:33:11,131
He really loves to show off his butt.

607
00:33:11,871 --> 00:33:14,020
Okay, let's do this.
We can do this!

608
00:33:14,641 --> 00:33:16,734
- Ready.
- Fighting!

609
00:33:17,631 --> 00:33:19,281
[The glint in his eye in back.]

610
00:33:19,282 --> 00:33:21,751
[I will make sure that we
succeed this time!]

611
00:33:22,902 --> 00:33:27,411
[Magical cane- Third attempt.]

612
00:33:28,874 --> 00:33:30,737
[Black hole Je Moon's clean start.]

613
00:33:32,364 --> 00:33:34,478
[He even gets the backdoor
opened correctly this time.]

614
00:33:35,578 --> 00:33:38,102
[Lightning fast speed.]

615
00:33:43,659 --> 00:33:45,809
[Must endure...]

616
00:33:48,497 --> 00:33:51,015
[The tail end of the mission is
now left up to the ladies...]

617
00:33:51,016 --> 00:33:53,255
Get in, get in!
Go!

618
00:33:56,759 --> 00:33:58,961
Get in, get in!
Go!

619
00:33:59,696 --> 00:34:02,861
[Lastly, even Dorothy Yoo Jung successfully
pulls off her magical cane off the car!]

620
00:34:05,341 --> 00:34:07,155
Close the door!

621
00:34:11,988 --> 00:34:15,411
[Dorothy and expeditioners-
Everyone makes their way in!]

622
00:34:19,848 --> 00:34:21,004
The door is open.

623
00:34:21,005 --> 00:34:24,721
[And their record is?]

624
00:34:24,722 --> 00:34:27,284
- We were totally fast this time.
- We were really fast.

625
00:34:27,285 --> 00:34:28,649
- We were really fast.
- We had to have succeeded this time.

626
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:31,670
- A new record.
- We got it. We got it this time.

627
00:34:32,328 --> 00:34:34,715
If they tell us that we didn't make it again,
I don't know what I'm going to do.

628
00:34:34,716 --> 00:34:35,991
I'm sure we made it this time.

629
00:34:35,992 --> 00:34:39,086
If they tell us that we failed again, I'm
going to stick this plunger on the camera

630
00:34:39,087 --> 00:34:41,043
and I can't guarantee what I'll
do after that.

631
00:34:41,985 --> 00:34:43,491
20... maybe 26 seconds?

632
00:34:44,309 --> 00:34:46,491
<i>25.41 seconds.</i>

633
00:34:46,492 --> 00:34:48,492
[New record of 25.41 seconds.]

634
00:34:48,493 --> 00:34:51,987
[Magical cane mission-
Passes with an astounding new record!]

635
00:34:58,543 --> 00:35:01,265
[If someone saw their reaction,
they'd think they just won a gold medal.]

636
00:35:01,576 --> 00:35:05,236
Je Moon just smiled!
I saw a smile on Je Moon's face!

637
00:35:05,237 --> 00:35:07,401
Je Moon can't go home now!

638
00:35:09,218 --> 00:35:11,095
<i>We will now give you one magical hint.</i>

639
00:35:11,096 --> 00:35:12,879
<i>Inside this magic envelope...</i>

640
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:17,620
<i>is a very useful tool that will help you
in your search for the wizard.</i>

641
00:35:17,621 --> 00:35:20,517
[Something crucial to help them find
Big-nosed Wizard inside the envelope...]

642
00:35:20,518 --> 00:35:24,718
<i>Even though I know that you're a team,
only one of you can have this envelope.</i>

643
00:35:24,718 --> 00:35:27,620
[The magical envelope containing the hint
will be given out to only one person.]

644
00:35:28,492 --> 00:35:32,123
- Give it to either Je Moon or Yoo Jung.
- Why don't you decide, Yoo Jung?

645
00:35:32,124 --> 00:35:34,932
- We all want that envelope.
- Am I not allowed to have that?

646
00:35:34,933 --> 00:35:36,528
- No, you can have it too.
- You can have it too.

647
00:35:38,169 --> 00:35:42,282
[The magical item's allure that even
Dorothy Yoo Jung can't seem to deny.]

648
00:35:42,283 --> 00:35:43,597
Give it to Dorothy then.

649
00:35:44,132 --> 00:35:48,352
[The unbelievable power of the magical envelope
will be revealed at the final race.]

650
00:35:49,095 --> 00:35:52,104
[Just then...]

651
00:35:52,105 --> 00:35:56,188
[A mysterious piece of paper
falls right out of the sky.]

652
00:35:57,108 --> 00:35:59,519
- We just received some sort of a letter.
- What? A letter?

653
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:03,218
[What message is found on that paper?]

654
00:36:03,219 --> 00:36:06,868
<i>Come to the library in Sabuk
if you want to meet me.</i>

655
00:36:06,869 --> 00:36:08,513
[Second message from Big-nosed Wizard.]

656
00:36:11,116 --> 00:36:14,532
- Let's go meet up with him.
- I don't particularly want to meet him.

657
00:36:14,533 --> 00:36:16,827
If we don't meet up with him,
then Suk Jin won't be on this episode?

658
00:36:16,828 --> 00:36:18,519
That's right.
Not if we don't meet up with him.

659
00:36:18,547 --> 00:36:21,248
[Please come!]

660
00:36:22,298 --> 00:36:25,455
You haven't been on many variety shows,
have you, Je Moon?

661
00:36:25,456 --> 00:36:27,568
- You're new to this, right?
- This is my first time on a variety.

662
00:36:27,569 --> 00:36:30,788
From what I saw earlier, I noticed
that you really like group games?

663
00:36:31,957 --> 00:36:34,726
[Je Moon's eagerness showing through
right from the beginning.]

664
00:36:34,727 --> 00:36:37,514
Do you want to know what he said to me
after the game was over?

665
00:36:37,515 --> 00:36:39,142
He said, 'This is really fun'.

666
00:36:40,662 --> 00:36:42,321
[Maybe he was made to be on
variety shows?]

667
00:36:42,786 --> 00:36:45,550
[Sabuk's library.]

668
00:36:48,635 --> 00:36:51,777
[Crash landing expert, Big-nosed Wizard
makes his landing on top of a bookcase.]

669
00:36:51,778 --> 00:36:53,132
Why can't I get this right?

670
00:36:53,133 --> 00:36:55,855
I can't get anything right because
I didn't graduate from the magic school.

671
00:36:55,856 --> 00:36:57,177
Okay, this is the place.

672
00:36:58,156 --> 00:37:01,463
[But what is he doing at the library?]

673
00:37:01,464 --> 00:37:03,380
Okay.

674
00:37:04,783 --> 00:37:06,991
[Magical powers activated.]

675
00:37:07,570 --> 00:37:12,123
[Voting booth appears out of thin air!]

676
00:37:12,124 --> 00:37:14,471
Since we're going to be
playing other games there too

677
00:37:14,472 --> 00:37:17,847
if there's anyone in this car that you want
to hand that first envelope over to...

678
00:37:18,742 --> 00:37:20,849
Jong Kook is basically telling you to
hand it over to him right now.

679
00:37:20,850 --> 00:37:22,256
No, that's not it.

680
00:37:22,257 --> 00:37:25,528
But... I think that you're the last person
who I should be giving this envelope to.

681
00:37:25,529 --> 00:37:28,146
- That's right, Yoo Jung.
- That's smart of you, Yoo Jung.

682
00:37:28,147 --> 00:37:30,563
Why don't you just give it to
whomever you want to give it to?

683
00:37:31,507 --> 00:37:33,311
You can give it to me if you want.

684
00:37:34,049 --> 00:37:36,543
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

685
00:37:38,166 --> 00:37:40,136
- Look at how happy he is.
- We were told that we can't open it.

686
00:37:40,137 --> 00:37:42,294
- Let's get out.
- Let's all get out of the car.

687
00:37:42,295 --> 00:37:44,569
[Kind-hearted Dorothy Yoo Jung
conceding to her elder.]

688
00:37:45,227 --> 00:37:47,190
Are we going to see Suk Jin in there?

689
00:37:48,543 --> 00:37:52,267
[What will Dorothy and her expeditioners'
second adventure be?]

690
00:37:54,127 --> 00:37:56,567
- Is Suk Jin not going to be in this episode?
- What is this?

691
00:37:59,061 --> 00:38:00,257
What is this?

692
00:38:00,258 --> 00:38:02,800
[Jae Suk discovers a mysterious booth.]

693
00:38:02,801 --> 00:38:04,648
Welcome, everyone.

694
00:38:04,649 --> 00:38:07,524
I have a huge surprise
in store for all of you.

695
00:38:07,525 --> 00:38:10,549
You've all fallen for my trap.

696
00:38:14,951 --> 00:38:17,121
- Look at all these books.
- What is this?

697
00:38:17,122 --> 00:38:18,997
[Another piece of paper falls from the sky?]

698
00:38:20,429 --> 00:38:23,249
<i>I see that you've all passed your
first adventure safely.</i>

699
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:25,315
He's talking to us in casual speech.

700
00:38:25,395 --> 00:38:26,978
Ah, because he's older than all of us?

701
00:38:26,979 --> 00:38:28,890
<i>You will be given a magical envelope.</i>

702
00:38:28,891 --> 00:38:32,626
<i>I will keep watching to see if you have
what it takes to catch up to me.</i>

703
00:38:33,396 --> 00:38:37,283
[Big-nosed Wizard...
What is he up to now?]

704
00:38:37,890 --> 00:38:40,075
- Do you all see the voting booth?
- Yes.

705
00:38:40,076 --> 00:38:45,875
<i>You have to step into the booth and vote for
the person who you want to have the envelope.</i>

706
00:38:45,876 --> 00:38:49,068
Since Je Moon has the envelope,
I'm sure he won't vote for himself, right?

707
00:38:49,069 --> 00:38:51,857
- Je Moon won't, right?
- I doubt that he will.

708
00:38:51,858 --> 00:38:53,613
I can't have two envelopes?

709
00:38:53,614 --> 00:38:56,414
[Well... of course, you can...]

710
00:38:56,415 --> 00:39:01,175
<i>You'll go on to the final mission location
after you're done voting.</i>

711
00:39:01,176 --> 00:39:02,844
- Already?
- What? Already?

712
00:39:02,845 --> 00:39:05,193
<i>When you make your move
to the final location</i>

713
00:39:05,194 --> 00:39:08,993
<i>you will get in the numbered car
according to which of the two you pick.</i>

714
00:39:09,523 --> 00:39:11,429
I guess that determines which team
we're all going to be on.

715
00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:15,441
[Car number one, and Car number two.]

716
00:39:15,442 --> 00:39:18,516
- That must be the team we're on.
- Let's not vote for ourselves.

717
00:39:18,517 --> 00:39:20,281
Should we make it a rule
not to vote for ourselves?

718
00:39:20,282 --> 00:39:23,339
- Let's not vote for ourselves.
- We know that you're still going to do it.

719
00:39:24,015 --> 00:39:27,572
[How did she know?
'Ha Ha'.]

720
00:39:29,032 --> 00:39:32,308
[And picks to see which car
he'll be riding in.]

721
00:39:37,352 --> 00:39:39,882
Be honest, and don't vote for yourself.

722
00:39:40,944 --> 00:39:44,853
[And immediately board
the car that they chose.]

723
00:39:49,345 --> 00:39:53,105
[Blank Ji votes for Dorothy Yoo Jung.]

724
00:39:58,759 --> 00:40:00,997
[And picks Car number one,
just like Ha Ha did.]

725
00:40:04,807 --> 00:40:06,962
Since he's playing my brother and all.

726
00:40:06,963 --> 00:40:10,382
[Dorothy Yoo Jung votes for
her brother, TOP.]

727
00:40:11,991 --> 00:40:15,983
[The car that Yoo Jung
will be riding in is...]

728
00:40:17,185 --> 00:40:21,119
[Je Moon makes his way to Car number one
after voting for Yoo Jung.]

729
00:40:22,779 --> 00:40:24,199
- Je Moon.
- We're all in this car?

730
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:28,487
[Gary, Ha Ha, and Ji Hyo are already
seated in Car number one.]

731
00:40:28,488 --> 00:40:32,029
[There are four people already
in the first car?]

732
00:40:32,606 --> 00:40:36,029
- I guess Yoo Jung's in the second car.
- Yes, she must be.

733
00:40:38,363 --> 00:40:42,179
[Currently, Yoo Jung is the only one
who picked the second car.]

734
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:43,899
Hello.

735
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:46,003
- Is this Car number one?
- This is Car number one.

736
00:40:46,004 --> 00:40:48,524
- How can this be?
- What is this? We're all here.

737
00:40:48,525 --> 00:40:50,137
- Why are you getting in this car?
- Where's Jong Kook?

738
00:40:50,138 --> 00:40:52,559
- I picked number one.
- Then Yoo Jung is the only one missing?

739
00:40:53,747 --> 00:40:55,964
[Something strange is going on here...]

740
00:40:55,965 --> 00:40:57,789
- Which one are you?
- Is he in this car too?

741
00:40:57,790 --> 00:40:59,905
[Even Kwang Soo is headed to their car?]

742
00:41:00,584 --> 00:41:03,632
[What's going on here?]

743
00:41:04,631 --> 00:41:07,943
[And lastly, even Jong Kook
heads over to the same car.]

744
00:41:07,944 --> 00:41:09,743
We're all number one.
Yoo Jung is the only one missing.

745
00:41:09,744 --> 00:41:11,117
Dorothy is the only one
who isn't here.

746
00:41:11,535 --> 00:41:16,307
[What... is going on here?]

747
00:41:16,308 --> 00:41:18,649
Are they all riding in the other car?

748
00:41:19,307 --> 00:41:21,179
Or are we all riding in our own cars?

749
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:24,357
[Car number two with only Dorothy Yoo Jung
as its passenger is already on the road.]

750
00:41:24,358 --> 00:41:25,763
Am I just being driven there separately?

751
00:41:28,951 --> 00:41:32,468
[Just then]

752
00:41:32,469 --> 00:41:36,447
[A figure clad in black moves in
on Dorothy.]

753
00:41:45,129 --> 00:41:48,491
[That's right...]

754
00:41:48,492 --> 00:41:51,589
[This was Big-nose Wizard's plan all along.]

755
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:54,866
<i>I'm taking your precious
Dorothy Yoo Jung with me.</i>

756
00:41:56,192 --> 00:41:58,630
[I'm taking Dorothy with me...]

757
00:41:58,631 --> 00:42:03,867
<i>If you want to get Dorothy back,
then come to the art mine.</i>

758
00:42:03,868 --> 00:42:05,360
No!

759
00:42:07,130 --> 00:42:13,204
[You dare... take my sister?]

760
00:42:13,998 --> 00:42:17,321
[Brother... save me...]

761
00:42:18,636 --> 00:42:21,950
[Ten minutes ago when it was
Dorothy Yoo Jung's turn to vote.]

762
00:42:22,752 --> 00:42:24,849
Is it finally Yoo Jung's turn?

763
00:42:24,850 --> 00:42:26,173
[Big-nosed Wizard was hiding behind
the bookcase all along.]

764
00:42:29,956 --> 00:42:33,852
[Switching out the ticketing ballot
right before Dorothy's turn.]

765
00:42:34,954 --> 00:42:38,261
Change into Car number two.

766
00:42:42,317 --> 00:42:43,941
Okay.

767
00:42:43,942 --> 00:42:46,503
[Transformed all the papers into
number two for Yoo Jung's turn.]

768
00:42:47,125 --> 00:42:50,278
[And places the box back in its place.]

769
00:42:53,648 --> 00:42:57,008
[That's how Dorothy Yoo Jung alone was the
only person to have picked Car number two.]

770
00:42:57,009 --> 00:42:59,754
- Aren't you scared about getting kidnapped?
- Where are you taking me?

771
00:42:59,755 --> 00:43:01,940
There's no need for me to tell you
where you're being taken to.

772
00:43:01,941 --> 00:43:03,677
You're being kidnapped right now.

773
00:43:03,984 --> 00:43:05,632
You're my hostage.

774
00:43:05,633 --> 00:43:09,188
I have big plans in the works
by using you as my bait.

775
00:43:09,189 --> 00:43:12,369
You just need to do
whatever I tell you to do.

776
00:43:12,370 --> 00:43:13,859
Do you understand?

777
00:43:14,743 --> 00:43:17,073
- I can make all your wishes come true.
- Seriously?

778
00:43:17,403 --> 00:43:19,468
With my magical wand.

779
00:43:20,368 --> 00:43:22,218
What's your wish?
I'll grant you one wish.

780
00:43:22,219 --> 00:43:24,800
I want to win today.

781
00:43:25,991 --> 00:43:27,913
That may be a bit difficult.

782
00:43:27,914 --> 00:43:31,670
- You said you'd grant me any wish I want!
- But I have to win today.

783
00:43:32,014 --> 00:43:33,650
I have to win.

784
00:43:33,651 --> 00:43:37,680
Anyway, my goal for the day is,
through the use of you...

785
00:43:38,792 --> 00:43:41,138
- I'm going to win today.
- No, I'm going to win.

786
00:43:41,693 --> 00:43:45,810
[The kidnapper and the hostage seem to
get along pretty well.]

787
00:43:48,774 --> 00:43:52,212
[Through the magical portal...
they arrive at the steel mine.]

788
00:43:54,174 --> 00:43:56,465
You're the hostage here.
You can't get out of the car first.

789
00:43:57,990 --> 00:43:59,457
Come this way.

790
00:43:59,458 --> 00:44:01,988
- Since you're the hostage...
- Please don't take me to jail.

791
00:44:01,989 --> 00:44:04,456
- It's not a jail.
- But that looks like jail.

792
00:44:06,170 --> 00:44:08,977
Open... portal!

793
00:44:10,075 --> 00:44:12,715
Open... portal!

794
00:44:12,716 --> 00:44:15,506
[As the wizard chants out his spell...]

795
00:44:15,507 --> 00:44:18,898
[The door to his magical home opens up!]

796
00:44:21,068 --> 00:44:25,870
[An abandoned mine that's been turned into
an art gallery is the wizard's lair.]

797
00:44:29,458 --> 00:44:30,771
Watch your step.

798
00:44:31,295 --> 00:44:32,767
You're my hostage.

799
00:44:32,768 --> 00:44:37,426
- I don't want to be your hostage.
- Do you take this wizard as a joke?

800
00:44:38,752 --> 00:44:41,499
Aren't you even afraid of me?
When I've kidnapped you as my hostage?

801
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:45,523
Don't you realize what a serious
situation you're stuck in right now?

802
00:44:45,885 --> 00:44:49,021
- I'm telling you that you're my hostage.
- This is fun.

803
00:44:49,631 --> 00:44:51,985
My brother TOP is going to
come rescue me.

804
00:44:52,836 --> 00:44:56,313
A wizard's lair needs to have a creepy feel
to it like this one.

805
00:44:57,104 --> 00:44:59,211
Do you see that sign?
It says, 'Do not enter'.

806
00:45:01,003 --> 00:45:03,674
[Taking his hostage, Dorothy to a place
where she can't be seen by others.]

807
00:45:04,208 --> 00:45:06,368
Get in.
Get in!

808
00:45:08,355 --> 00:45:10,797
This is my lair!

809
00:45:12,169 --> 00:45:14,532
Couldn't you have picked someplace
warmer as your lair?

810
00:45:14,993 --> 00:45:16,397
This is it.

811
00:45:16,398 --> 00:45:18,497
[Wizard's mystical chair.]

812
00:45:21,049 --> 00:45:23,182
- Is this where I sit?
- I've got security cameras.

813
00:45:23,873 --> 00:45:26,542
No, this is your chair.
You're the hostage.

814
00:45:26,543 --> 00:45:28,109
- Wow, security cameras.
- That's right. Security cameras.

815
00:45:28,110 --> 00:45:30,781
[Security cameras displayed on the screen
where he can track other members' moves.]

816
00:45:31,820 --> 00:45:33,234
Dorothy.

817
00:45:33,235 --> 00:45:37,165
[It's time for things to start playing out
as Big-nosed Wizard had planned?]

818
00:45:37,166 --> 00:45:38,980
All the other members will now start to
make their moves according to my orders.

819
00:45:38,981 --> 00:45:40,396
Do you understand?

820
00:45:41,502 --> 00:45:43,858
They're all in the palm of my hand!

821
00:45:45,966 --> 00:45:47,893
- It's a bit cold in here, isn't it?
- Yes.

822
00:45:49,254 --> 00:45:51,205
[In a few moments...]

823
00:45:51,206 --> 00:45:52,813
<i>This is closed off.</i>

824
00:45:54,068 --> 00:45:57,646
[The Running Man members arrive in
front of the closed magical portal.]

825
00:45:57,647 --> 00:45:59,163
What is it barred off?

826
00:45:59,932 --> 00:46:02,306
<i>I see that you've all made it.</i>

827
00:46:04,431 --> 00:46:06,896
<i>I see that you've all made it.</i>

828
00:46:06,897 --> 00:46:11,482
<i>You all have to do as I tell you to do
if you want to get Dorothy Yoo Jung back.</i>

829
00:46:11,858 --> 00:46:14,599
<i>Once the door opens,
everyone step in through the portal </i>

830
00:46:14,599 --> 00:46:17,806
<i>and eliminate each other's
name tags.</i>

831
00:46:18,683 --> 00:46:22,395
[Eliminate... each other's name tags?]

832
00:46:22,396 --> 00:46:27,261
<i>Once two out of the eight of you have been
ousted and only six of you are left alive...</i>

833
00:46:27,530 --> 00:46:31,994
<i>only then will you be able to move closer
to where Yoo Jung and I are hiding.</i>

834
00:46:31,995 --> 00:46:34,052
[When the second portal opens,
they will move on to the next stage.]

835
00:46:34,053 --> 00:46:37,059
[The next door will open up only when they
follow Big-nosed wizard's instructions.]

836
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:41,122
[Then...
the portal to the final race will open!]

837
00:46:41,676 --> 00:46:44,681
<i>I will count to ten once the
portal opens...</i>

838
00:46:44,682 --> 00:46:49,270
<i>so move quickly to situate yourself,
and start the name tag elimination.</i>

839
00:46:50,251 --> 00:46:52,714
<i>Keep in mind that only when
two of you have been eliminated</i>

840
00:46:52,715 --> 00:46:56,508
<i>that's when you'll be able to
see your precious Yoo Jung again!</i>

841
00:46:56,509 --> 00:47:00,172
[Eliminate their own friends in order
to rescue Dorothy?]

842
00:47:00,673 --> 00:47:02,041
<i>Before we go on...</i>

843
00:47:02,042 --> 00:47:07,359
<i>One of you possesses a magical envelope that
you earned from the first mission, right?</i>

844
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:08,486
Yes, Je Moon has it.

845
00:47:08,487 --> 00:47:10,785
Please open the envelope now.

846
00:47:10,786 --> 00:47:12,886
[Time to open up the envelope.]

847
00:47:12,887 --> 00:47:16,432
[What is inside that magical envelope?]

848
00:47:17,958 --> 00:47:20,448
A free pass?
A free pass through the first round.

849
00:47:22,121 --> 00:47:24,244
Why do you look so happy about it?

850
00:47:25,105 --> 00:47:27,659
First round... pass!

851
00:47:27,660 --> 00:47:29,215
[First round- Pass.]

852
00:47:31,472 --> 00:47:33,262
- Je Moon's disappeared.
- Where did he disappear off to?

853
00:47:33,263 --> 00:47:35,415
He passed through the first round.

854
00:47:38,454 --> 00:47:44,224
[As for the remaining seven members...
time to enter through the first portal.]

855
00:47:46,817 --> 00:47:49,412
It has begun.

856
00:47:50,583 --> 00:47:54,310
- We have to eliminate each other?
- We all have to scatter out on our own.

857
00:47:54,311 --> 00:47:55,725
[Once two of them have been eliminated,
everyone moves on to Round Two.]

858
00:47:55,726 --> 00:47:59,879
[The start of Big-nosed Wizard's countdown.]

859
00:48:00,679 --> 00:48:01,743
I have to get situated first.

860
00:48:01,744 --> 00:48:05,539
[All the Running Man members rush off
in a flurry of desperation.]

861
00:48:09,056 --> 00:48:11,894
<i>Race... start!</i>

862
00:48:14,855 --> 00:48:17,268
This is all going exactly
the way I planned.

863
00:48:20,059 --> 00:48:22,822
[What will become of
Dorothy Yoo Jung's fate?]

864
00:48:26,782 --> 00:48:30,139
[Even though they're feeling flustered,
the best thing to do for now is to hide.]

865
00:48:35,138 --> 00:48:37,384
Please don't film me right now.
I'm just going to hide.

866
00:48:43,608 --> 00:48:46,453
[They've all become masters
at hiding by this point.]

867
00:48:47,767 --> 00:48:49,625
I think I'm going to hide right here.

868
00:48:51,969 --> 00:48:53,796
Are these all individual rooms?

869
00:48:53,797 --> 00:48:55,441
Are these dorm rooms?

870
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:59,163
[Dorm rooms where artists can stay
while working on their art pieces.]

871
00:48:59,651 --> 00:49:01,054
What is all this?

872
00:49:03,771 --> 00:49:06,436
This is an art gallery of sorts.

873
00:49:16,091 --> 00:49:17,960
I know where Kwang Soo went.

874
00:49:17,961 --> 00:49:21,487
A fight has to start somewhere so two can
get eliminated and we can move on.

875
00:49:21,488 --> 00:49:24,807
- Okay, let's do that.
- We can't exhaust ourselves in Round One.

876
00:49:25,195 --> 00:49:28,356
I feel... that I haven't been treating
you the best lately.

877
00:49:30,954 --> 00:49:33,208
Why don't you keep going...
where you were going?

878
00:49:33,209 --> 00:49:35,314
The only thing I can do at this point
is to stay in hiding.

879
00:49:41,950 --> 00:49:44,584
[Jae Suk encounters Mr. Capable and Ace.]

880
00:49:44,585 --> 00:49:46,459
This is a pure coincidence
that we're running into you like this.

881
00:49:46,460 --> 00:49:48,486
Really?
We should just end this quickly.

882
00:49:48,911 --> 00:49:53,206
Upstairs... Ha Ha and others are up there,
so let's just quickly...

883
00:49:54,153 --> 00:49:55,688
You just wait here then.

884
00:49:56,437 --> 00:49:58,068
You just wait here then.

885
00:49:59,172 --> 00:50:00,952
Okay, thanks.

886
00:50:00,953 --> 00:50:03,352
- See you later.
- Thanks!

887
00:50:03,353 --> 00:50:05,211
- I'll just wait down here.
- Okay.

888
00:50:05,212 --> 00:50:06,992
Please finish it off quickly.
I'll see you later.

889
00:50:08,361 --> 00:50:10,916
- He's all the way down at the end.
- Down at the end?

890
00:50:13,248 --> 00:50:15,905
[Meanwhile, oblivious Ha Ha...]

891
00:50:18,031 --> 00:50:20,757
[Escapes into a guest room.]

892
00:50:47,787 --> 00:50:50,918
[It's the Grim Reaper!]

893
00:50:50,919 --> 00:50:52,723
No!
Why you of all people!

894
00:50:53,971 --> 00:50:56,297
[Ha Ha in extreme danger!]

895
00:50:56,298 --> 00:50:58,719
That's right, fight!
Rip him to shreds!

896
00:50:58,720 --> 00:50:59,981
I said, rip him!

897
00:50:59,982 --> 00:51:02,933
No!
Why does it have to be you of all people!

898
00:51:02,934 --> 00:51:05,231
[Will Ha Ha become the first victim?]

899
00:51:05,232 --> 00:51:06,397
Why!

900
00:51:06,398 --> 00:51:08,223
[Jong Kook eliminates Ha Ha's name tag.]

901
00:51:08,224 --> 00:51:10,244
[Ha Ha- Out!]

902
00:51:13,709 --> 00:51:15,582
[Poor Ha Ha...]

903
00:51:16,483 --> 00:51:20,274
<i>Ha Ha, out.
Ha Ha, out.</i>

904
00:51:25,447 --> 00:51:27,561
I really love Jong Kook in
times like this.

905
00:51:27,562 --> 00:51:31,852
He always keeps his word
if he says he's going to do something.

906
00:51:31,853 --> 00:51:34,525
I really loves it when he does that.
He takes care of things.

907
00:51:36,954 --> 00:51:38,470
There's only one elimination left.

908
00:51:39,510 --> 00:51:41,238
Just one more person left to go.

909
00:51:46,144 --> 00:51:48,943
[Jae Suk staying on Kwang Soo's trail.]

910
00:51:49,467 --> 00:51:51,315
[Kwang Soo went that way!]

911
00:51:52,616 --> 00:51:55,194
[Everyone seems to have decided on
getting rid of the icon of betrayal.]

912
00:51:55,195 --> 00:51:56,602
- He went outside.
- Seriously?

913
00:51:57,160 --> 00:51:59,607
[Kwang Soo's disappeared?]

914
00:51:59,608 --> 00:52:02,239
[Rule- They cannot go outside...]

915
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:03,702
Hang on a second.

916
00:52:06,788 --> 00:52:09,920
[A locked door...]

917
00:52:09,921 --> 00:52:13,302
[Giraffe locked the door from the inside.]

918
00:52:16,624 --> 00:52:21,268
[Seems to be asking the worker who's inside
the office for a favor of some sorts.]

919
00:52:21,791 --> 00:52:25,510
- This door wasn't locked earlier.
- What is this? I thought you can't lock it.

920
00:52:25,511 --> 00:52:29,403
Wait.
Wait a minute. Excuse me, Sir.

921
00:52:29,878 --> 00:52:31,935
- No, you can't come in here.
- What do you mean, we can't?

922
00:52:31,936 --> 00:52:34,313
- Wait a minute. Excuse me.
- You can't come in here.

923
00:52:34,314 --> 00:52:36,722
- Excuse me?
- I said, you can't come in here.

924
00:52:36,723 --> 00:52:38,957
Your voice seems to be trembling a lot.

925
00:52:39,431 --> 00:52:43,541
Why is your voice trembling so much?
I'm sorry, but you sound nervous.

926
00:52:44,606 --> 00:52:46,794
Excuse me, Sir.
Can you open the door for a moment?

927
00:52:46,795 --> 00:52:49,032
[What do we do now?]

928
00:52:51,005 --> 00:52:52,381
Let's just go for now.

929
00:52:53,843 --> 00:52:56,871
[Huh?
Are they just going to leave like this?]

930
00:52:56,872 --> 00:52:59,412
[They seem to be working
on some sort of a plan.]

931
00:53:00,219 --> 00:53:02,808
- Let go! Let go of me!
- I'm going to get rid of you right now!

932
00:53:02,809 --> 00:53:04,915
- Let me go!
- We're right here, Jong Kook!

933
00:53:04,916 --> 00:53:06,714
Come help me!
Help me get him!

934
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:11,350
[Should I go, or not?
Go, or not?]

935
00:53:13,692 --> 00:53:16,679
[All the members are in hiding for the
chance to ambush attack Kwang Soo.]

936
00:53:17,394 --> 00:53:20,682
[Deceived by the silence,
and slowly opens the door.]

937
00:53:23,267 --> 00:53:26,050
[Gary and Jae Suk's plan succeeds!]

938
00:53:26,051 --> 00:53:28,689
Did you really feel the need to get
this nice man to lie to us like that?

939
00:53:28,690 --> 00:53:30,697
We can't break any of the pieces in here,
so come outside right now.

940
00:53:30,698 --> 00:53:32,041
- Come outside.
- Okay, I'll come outside.

941
00:53:32,042 --> 00:53:33,965
- We can't break anything in here.
- Let's go outside.

942
00:53:33,966 --> 00:53:36,551
[Agreeing to battle it out
in a more open spaced area.]

943
00:53:36,552 --> 00:53:38,875
Okay, I've agreed to come out.

944
00:53:38,875 --> 00:53:41,859
Let's do this man to man.
I don't want to do this like a coward.

945
00:53:41,860 --> 00:53:44,169
Be careful. Let's go over
there as not to break anything.

946
00:53:44,170 --> 00:53:46,281
- Let's go to an open space.
- Okay.

947
00:53:49,457 --> 00:53:51,730
[Just then,
Gary moves in on Kwang Soo's back?]

948
00:53:52,975 --> 00:53:56,622
[Sneaks up...
and eliminates Kwang Soo's name tag.]

949
00:53:56,623 --> 00:53:58,219
I thought we were going to go
to a bigger open space.

950
00:53:58,220 --> 00:54:01,329
I never said that myself.
This is what you always do to us.

951
00:54:01,330 --> 00:54:03,305
That was no fun at all.

952
00:54:03,306 --> 00:54:05,403
I'm having a blast right now.

953
00:54:05,959 --> 00:54:10,183
<i>Lee Kwang Soo, out.
Lee Kwang Soo, out.</i>

954
00:54:10,184 --> 00:54:13,711
- I thought we were going to go...
- I don't remember saying that.

955
00:54:14,332 --> 00:54:16,246
Gary.
Gary!

956
00:54:16,247 --> 00:54:17,647
[Kwang Soo- Out!]

957
00:54:17,648 --> 00:54:19,423
[Eliminate two people in the first round...]

958
00:54:19,424 --> 00:54:22,297
[Ha Ha and Kwang Soo- Out!]

959
00:54:23,513 --> 00:54:26,388
[Everything's going according to my plan.]

960
00:54:36,108 --> 00:54:38,334
- No one can eliminate my name tag.
- Yoo Jung.

961
00:54:38,664 --> 00:54:40,352
Didn't you say that you wanted to win?

962
00:54:40,353 --> 00:54:42,106
Want to try playing a name tag
elimination game just the two of us?

963
00:54:42,107 --> 00:54:43,928
[Just the two of them playing a round of
name tag elimination game out of boredom?]

964
00:54:43,929 --> 00:54:44,977
I'll cast a magic spell.

965
00:54:44,978 --> 00:54:47,388
That you can't be eliminated even if
I rip off your name tag right now.

966
00:54:47,389 --> 00:54:49,855
[Using magic to ensure that no one is ousted
even if the name tag gets ripped off?]

967
00:54:51,372 --> 00:54:54,332
- I cannot get ousted!
- Yup!

968
00:54:54,333 --> 00:54:56,031
Okay.

969
00:54:56,032 --> 00:54:58,010
It won't be easy to rip my
name tag off.

970
00:55:01,944 --> 00:55:03,615
Set, go.
Neither one of us will get ousted.

971
00:55:03,616 --> 00:55:05,350
It'll be easier for me to rip your tag off
if you keep holding onto it

972
00:55:05,351 --> 00:55:06,814
since you only have the use of one hand.

973
00:55:06,814 --> 00:55:08,219
[First time contender, Dorothy Yoo Jung
vs. Weakest player, Big-nosed wizard.]

974
00:55:08,220 --> 00:55:10,498
Wow, you're strong.
Wow!

975
00:55:10,499 --> 00:55:12,007
She's really strong!
I'm serious!

976
00:55:12,008 --> 00:55:13,818
Why are you so strong?

977
00:55:16,571 --> 00:55:19,868
[Dorothy playing with the wizard
like her little toy.]

978
00:55:19,869 --> 00:55:21,954
I'm serious.
I'm not joking about this.

979
00:55:21,955 --> 00:55:23,621
[Big-nosed wizard is being
pushed around by little Dorothy.]

980
00:55:23,622 --> 00:55:25,125
Hey, Yoo Jung.

981
00:55:29,107 --> 00:55:31,737
[Dorothy and her monstrous strength!]

982
00:55:33,817 --> 00:55:35,466
She's not an easy opponent.
I'm serious.

983
00:55:36,616 --> 00:55:39,314
[Yoo Jung grabs onto his cape!]

984
00:55:42,369 --> 00:55:43,908
Look at her!

985
00:55:43,909 --> 00:55:47,262
[His cape may become his downfall!]

986
00:55:47,263 --> 00:55:48,767
I can't let you beat me like this.

987
00:55:50,315 --> 00:55:53,509
[The unbelievable power of
the 14 year old girl!]

988
00:55:56,429 --> 00:55:59,735
[Yoo Jung eliminates Suk Jin's name tag!]

989
00:56:01,085 --> 00:56:03,552
[Utter humiliation!]

990
00:56:03,553 --> 00:56:05,196
I can't believe this.

991
00:56:05,197 --> 00:56:07,965
[What will happen to sturdy Dorothy,
and the frail wizard?]

992
00:56:10,822 --> 00:56:14,386
[Meanwhile, the remaining Running Man
members who have survived...]

993
00:56:14,387 --> 00:56:16,601
[arrive at the second portal!]

994
00:56:16,968 --> 00:56:18,830
- TOP, be careful.
- Okay.

995
00:56:18,831 --> 00:56:21,132
There you are.

996
00:56:21,133 --> 00:56:22,951
What took you guys so long?

997
00:56:23,698 --> 00:56:26,987
- You sound so nice and calm.
- You want to know why we took so long?

998
00:56:27,856 --> 00:56:29,306
You survived?

999
00:56:30,843 --> 00:56:32,916
I bet you won't be smiling anymore
once we walk in there.

1000
00:56:33,962 --> 00:56:35,334
[Wait for the real Je Moon to
make his appearance...]

1001
00:56:35,335 --> 00:56:40,978
<i>Seeing you guys tearing your friends apart
whom you've traveled with thus far...</i>

1002
00:56:40,979 --> 00:56:43,686
<i>It left a very memorable
impression on me.</i>

1003
00:56:43,687 --> 00:56:45,494
He's such an awful actor.

1004
00:56:46,082 --> 00:56:48,734
<i>I'll tell you the rules for
your next round.</i>

1005
00:56:48,735 --> 00:56:50,905
<i>Come and get me if you can!</i>

1006
00:56:50,906 --> 00:56:52,555
[Come and get me!]

1007
00:56:52,556 --> 00:56:56,381
[Come catch... the wizard?]

1008
00:56:59,141 --> 00:57:03,259
[Big-nosed wizard challenging them
to come and get him.]

1009
00:57:03,260 --> 00:57:07,608
[What is he trying to do?]

1010
00:57:09,495 --> 00:57:12,775
[The countdown to the second round starts!]

1011
00:57:12,776 --> 00:57:15,823
<i>Seven.
Six.</i>

1012
00:57:15,824 --> 00:57:18,589
<i>Five.
Four.</i>

1013
00:57:18,590 --> 00:57:22,466
<i>Three. Two. One!</i>

1014
00:57:22,467 --> 00:57:25,612
<i>Race... start!</i>

1015
00:57:26,959 --> 00:57:29,262
[As predicted,
the glint in Je Moon's eyes changes!]

1016
00:57:35,573 --> 00:57:37,705
You startled me!
What are you doing over there?

1017
00:57:40,167 --> 00:57:41,931
- So I just attack?
- Yes.

1018
00:57:42,729 --> 00:57:44,310
Be careful, Je Moon.

1019
00:57:44,311 --> 00:57:48,892
[Continuing to follow... Gary's back.]

1020
00:57:53,332 --> 00:57:55,777
[The terrorizing sound of his laughter.]

1021
00:57:58,334 --> 00:58:01,573
[Locked on his target?
Continuing to follow Gary's back.]

1022
00:58:01,574 --> 00:58:03,059
He keeps on following us.

1023
00:58:04,667 --> 00:58:07,787
[The mounting terror as he casually
continues to stalk them.]

1024
00:58:12,033 --> 00:58:14,009
- What did the wizard say?
- Did he tell us to eliminate each other?

1025
00:58:14,010 --> 00:58:16,431
- I don't think that's what he said.
- What did he say then?

1026
00:58:16,832 --> 00:58:18,694
He didn't really tell us to
eliminate each other's name tag.

1027
00:58:19,131 --> 00:58:20,622
No, he didn't say that.

1028
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:23,490
It could've been bad
if I ripped off your name tag.

1029
00:58:24,244 --> 00:58:26,304
What makes you think that
you could eliminate my name tag?

1030
00:58:28,498 --> 00:58:31,347
[I can do it like this.]

1031
00:58:44,072 --> 00:58:48,217
[TOP in front of the Monday Couple's path.]

1032
00:58:48,218 --> 00:58:50,229
[With Je Moon in in the rear of their path.]

1033
00:58:50,230 --> 00:58:51,844
[Stuck between a rock and a hard place.]

1034
00:58:53,685 --> 00:58:58,019
[There he goes with his
terrorizing laugh again.]

1035
00:58:58,020 --> 00:59:01,538
[In this case, the Monday Couple is...]

1036
00:59:01,539 --> 00:59:03,313
Why are you acting like Jong Kook?

1037
00:59:03,314 --> 00:59:05,223
The way I see it, hang on a second...

1038
00:59:05,224 --> 00:59:08,085
- Jae Suk, he didn't tell us to eliminate.
- He didn't say anything about elimination.

1039
00:59:08,086 --> 00:59:10,593
I think that we're
misunderstood right now.

1040
00:59:21,062 --> 00:59:23,929
[Monday Couple is still surrounded
on both sides.]

1041
00:59:25,702 --> 00:59:27,458
- Let's go that way.
- How about that way?

1042
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:33,364
[Je Moon continues to prey on Gary!]

1043
00:59:34,249 --> 00:59:36,320
[Just then...]

1044
00:59:36,321 --> 00:59:38,810
[What!]

1045
00:59:38,811 --> 00:59:41,583
[Big-nosed wizard makes his appearance!]

1046
00:59:45,334 --> 00:59:47,417
[Je Moon's name tag!]

1047
00:59:51,618 --> 00:59:53,857
[Big-nosed wizard eliminates
Je Moon's name tag!]

1048
00:59:53,858 --> 00:59:56,533
[What is going on here!]

1049
01:00:00,361 --> 01:00:04,247
[Big-nosed wizard finally makes his
appearance in front of Running Man members!]

1050
01:00:04,674 --> 01:00:07,015
[Je Moon is still reeling from shock,
and doesn't even know what to say!]

1051
01:00:08,204 --> 01:00:10,071
Why is Suk Jin ripping off our name tags?

1052
01:00:10,734 --> 01:00:12,585
Are we not allowed to rip off
Suk Jin's name tag?

1053
01:00:13,292 --> 01:00:15,143
What was that noise?
What's going on?

1054
01:00:16,307 --> 01:00:18,959
[Big-nosed wizard is heading their way!]

1055
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:22,356
[He approached them
and starts a conversation!]

1056
01:00:22,739 --> 01:00:24,642
- What are you, Suk Jin?
- Me?

1057
01:00:24,643 --> 01:00:26,616
- I'm the wizard.
- You're the wizard?

1058
01:00:26,617 --> 01:00:28,437
- What are you doing?
- I'm the wizard.

1059
01:00:28,438 --> 01:00:30,427
[All explanations aside, attack first!]

1060
01:00:30,428 --> 01:00:33,601
[Unlike other times, Big-nose
is acting aggressive and attacks!]

1061
01:00:33,602 --> 01:00:36,622
- What? What are you doing?
- Is he allowed to do that?

1062
01:00:37,283 --> 01:00:39,335
I thought we were just attacking
each other.

1063
01:00:40,099 --> 01:00:41,698
But he came out of nowhere.

1064
01:00:41,699 --> 01:00:43,359
- Why are you being like this?
- Because I want to win!

1065
01:00:43,981 --> 01:00:46,176
Because I want to win.
I'm going to win!

1066
01:00:47,080 --> 01:00:51,239
[Holding tightly onto
the wizard to keep him in place...]

1067
01:00:51,921 --> 01:00:53,403
I'm the wizard!

1068
01:00:54,973 --> 01:00:58,070
- Sit him down and make him talk.
- I'll tell you.

1069
01:00:58,071 --> 01:01:00,028
- Tell us what's going on.
- You're wondering about Yoo Jung, right?

1070
01:01:01,799 --> 01:01:05,925
Hey! You guys don't
know what's going on here.

1071
01:01:06,368 --> 01:01:09,089
- What's going on here?
- Why do you keep attacking us?

1072
01:01:10,492 --> 01:01:12,001
Hold onto him.

1073
01:01:12,002 --> 01:01:13,556
[Attacking at every chance he gets.]

1074
01:01:13,557 --> 01:01:15,687
I'm going to rip off your name tag
if you don't calm down.

1075
01:01:16,401 --> 01:01:20,746
[Everything will be over if
the wizard's name tag is ripped off...]

1076
01:01:21,924 --> 01:01:23,666
I'm going to rip off your name tag
if you don't calm down.

1077
01:01:29,421 --> 01:01:33,612
[He rips off the name tag...]

1078
01:01:36,977 --> 01:01:38,449
What is this?

1079
01:01:40,258 --> 01:01:43,458
[Reflect]

1080
01:01:44,065 --> 01:01:47,482
[Reflect!]

1081
01:01:48,269 --> 01:01:50,497
Only one more left to go now.

1082
01:01:53,968 --> 01:01:58,993
[He's disappeared!
What's going on here!]

1083
01:01:58,994 --> 01:02:01,334
- What did he mean by that?
- You shouldn't have ripped it off.

1084
01:02:01,335 --> 01:02:04,929
[He had no choice but to rip it off,
but what is going on here?]

1085
01:02:04,930 --> 01:02:08,606
<i>Yoo Jae Suk, out.
Yoo Jae Suk, out.</i>

1086
01:02:08,607 --> 01:02:11,828
[Ousted instead and the wizard disappears.
Just what is going on here?]

1087
01:02:12,513 --> 01:02:14,783
[Moments before Round Two started.]

1088
01:02:16,205 --> 01:02:19,575
[Wizard suggesting to welcome others
to throw them off their balance.]

1089
01:02:20,105 --> 01:02:22,072
- Okay.
- I promise that I'll do it.

1090
01:02:22,073 --> 01:02:25,378
- Don't make me laugh.
- I'm serious!

1091
01:02:26,937 --> 01:02:29,064
Avatar... go fight!

1092
01:02:31,167 --> 01:02:34,363
[Creates an image of the wizard himself...]

1093
01:02:34,364 --> 01:02:39,525
[The wizard that they've been battling
is only an image of the real wizard himself!]

1094
01:02:39,526 --> 01:02:41,309
- You're the wizard?
- What are you doing?

1095
01:02:41,310 --> 01:02:44,139
[That's why he was being more aggressive
about his attack on Running Man members!]

1096
01:02:47,582 --> 01:02:53,266
[The image eliminated the name tag...
and thus, Yoo Jae Suk is ousted.]

1097
01:02:56,346 --> 01:02:57,888
Then does that mean that I'm still alive?

1098
01:02:57,889 --> 01:03:00,627
[Je Moon is resurrected from having had
his name tag ripped off by the image.]

1099
01:03:06,031 --> 01:03:08,760
<i>Since Jae Suk was ousted by
an image of me</i>

1100
01:03:08,761 --> 01:03:13,690
<i>one more person now needs to be ousted
before you can pass through the second round.</i>

1101
01:03:13,691 --> 01:03:18,455
<i>Then... I want the rest of you to
battle amongst yourselves</i>

1102
01:03:18,456 --> 01:03:21,638
<i>to oust one more person from the
five of you that are still left alive.</i>

1103
01:03:22,833 --> 01:03:25,529
[Frightening Je Moon is
on the move once again!]

1104
01:03:25,530 --> 01:03:28,398
[As before, his target is still Gary!]

1105
01:03:29,061 --> 01:03:32,254
Then does it mean that Suk Jin isn't
going to be here for the last round either?

1106
01:03:32,255 --> 01:03:35,091
He's hiding out somewhere.
He has Yoo Jung in captivity.

1107
01:03:37,041 --> 01:03:41,189
He keeps on staring at me.
He won't take his eyes off of me.

1108
01:03:41,190 --> 01:03:42,917
[Is it time for me to rip off
Gary's name tag?]

1109
01:03:44,708 --> 01:03:46,144
[Since it's come down to this...]

1110
01:03:46,145 --> 01:03:49,029
[Let's just do this face to face.]

1111
01:03:49,030 --> 01:03:50,973
Gary's very good, Je Moon.
He has really good skills.

1112
01:03:50,974 --> 01:03:53,991
- But I'm a pretty good athlete too.
- Why don't you face him one on one?

1113
01:03:53,992 --> 01:03:55,058
[The big match- Start.]

1114
01:03:56,665 --> 01:03:58,970
[Grabbing onto Gary like an
experienced judo athlete.]

1115
01:03:58,971 --> 01:04:02,064
[And not letting go of his death grip!]

1116
01:04:02,065 --> 01:04:04,861
[How can this be?
Mr. Gary isn't able to make a move!]

1117
01:04:12,760 --> 01:04:15,075
What are they doing?
Dancing the traditional Korean dance?

1118
01:04:17,548 --> 01:04:18,953
This is fun.

1119
01:04:19,900 --> 01:04:21,776
[Spins him around and round...]

1120
01:04:22,936 --> 01:04:27,264
[Spins around again...]

1121
01:04:27,265 --> 01:04:30,351
[Je Moon eliminates Gary's name tag!]

1122
01:04:31,293 --> 01:04:34,428
Wow! I can't believe it!
It's almost impossible to do it like that.

1123
01:04:34,429 --> 01:04:36,657
<i>Gary, out.</i>

1124
01:04:36,658 --> 01:04:39,220
- Why did you target me like that?
- Sorry.

1125
01:04:40,446 --> 01:04:42,868
[Round two-
Jae Suk, and Gary- Out!]

1126
01:04:49,008 --> 01:04:51,841
- This stuff is really hard.
- Lose all your memories.

1127
01:04:52,949 --> 01:04:55,016
You won't be able to win.
Yup.

1128
01:04:56,737 --> 01:04:58,330
I'm going to win today.

1129
01:04:58,878 --> 01:05:00,049
You know what I'm like, don't you?

1130
01:05:00,050 --> 01:05:02,636
I don't go easy on anyone.
Not even on girl group members.

1131
01:05:02,637 --> 01:05:04,734
[Specialist on ousting female guests-
Cold hearted Big-nose.]

1132
01:05:05,821 --> 01:05:07,832
I'm the wizard.

1133
01:05:07,833 --> 01:05:09,999
[Whether he is or not,
all she wants to do is play.]

1134
01:05:10,657 --> 01:05:14,273
[Dorothy is all excited since she doesn't
seem to be fearing the wizard whatsoever.]

1135
01:05:14,709 --> 01:05:17,100
I'm going to win this episode
of Running Man.

1136
01:05:21,137 --> 01:05:22,461
I think it's that way.

1137
01:05:22,462 --> 01:05:24,521
[Off to the next portal.]

1138
01:05:24,522 --> 01:05:26,156
- Let's go.
- This is fun.

1139
01:05:29,025 --> 01:05:34,210
[The path that will lead them
through the third portal...]

1140
01:05:34,211 --> 01:05:39,928
[The eerie atmosphere to
perfectly match the wizard's lair.]

1141
01:05:41,050 --> 01:05:44,203
I think this is the way to go down
to the sub terrain floor.

1142
01:05:44,204 --> 01:05:48,409
[The path that used to lead down to the mine
is still left perfectly intact.]

1143
01:05:48,980 --> 01:05:52,353
- This place itself is like...
- It's like a museum.

1144
01:05:53,976 --> 01:05:55,186
Right?

1145
01:05:56,146 --> 01:05:58,579
[The third portal.]

1146
01:05:58,580 --> 01:06:00,709
[Opens]

1147
01:06:04,695 --> 01:06:09,056
[To the final location where they will
meet up with the wizard and Yoo Jung.]

1148
01:06:10,188 --> 01:06:12,420
That looks like our portal.

1149
01:06:13,551 --> 01:06:15,315
That looks like the same iron gate.

1150
01:06:15,316 --> 01:06:19,027
<i>There are only four of you still left alive.</i>

1151
01:06:19,303 --> 01:06:22,738
<i>Soon, you'll be able to see
your Yoo Jung again.</i>

1152
01:06:22,739 --> 01:06:27,269
<i>You must eliminate your last two members,
so that only two of you are left alive!</i>

1153
01:06:27,270 --> 01:06:30,216
[Eliminate two out of the four survivors!]

1154
01:06:30,881 --> 01:06:33,736
I heard some screaming,
then I heard that Je Moon was eliminated.

1155
01:06:33,737 --> 01:06:37,574
Then Suk Jin walks up to us,
and went crazy trying to eliminate me.

1156
01:06:37,575 --> 01:06:40,697
So what else could I do?
I eliminated him, and then I saw his tag.

1157
01:06:40,698 --> 01:06:45,291
Then I found out that Je Moon is still alive,
and I'm the only one that got ousted.

1158
01:06:47,780 --> 01:06:50,645
[No clue as to what Jae Suk is saying
from having been ousted so early on.]

1159
01:06:50,646 --> 01:06:52,669
- Bottom line is that you're here now.
- You're ousted now.

1160
01:06:52,670 --> 01:06:54,910
Seriously.
What is this all about today?

1161
01:06:54,911 --> 01:06:57,807
What are they thinking by ousting the
three main stars of the show here?

1162
01:06:57,808 --> 01:07:00,426
[Say what?]

1163
01:07:00,427 --> 01:07:01,834
- What kind words.
- What are they doing with this episode?

1164
01:07:01,835 --> 01:07:05,368
- You've got Brad Pitt over here...
- And Orlando Bloom over here.

1165
01:07:05,369 --> 01:07:07,065
He's Orlando Bloom,
and who do you want to be?

1166
01:07:07,066 --> 01:07:08,467
- Tom Cruise.
- He's Tom Cruise.

1167
01:07:08,468 --> 01:07:11,667
You've got all three of us here.
What are you going to do about this now?

1168
01:07:11,668 --> 01:07:12,838
What's this?

1169
01:07:12,839 --> 01:07:14,337
Did you get ousted?

1170
01:07:14,338 --> 01:07:17,301
- Who ousted you?
- Jong Kook.

1171
01:07:17,336 --> 01:07:19,461
Ugh, that Kim Jong Kook.

1172
01:07:21,539 --> 01:07:25,033
[Mr. Capable eliminates Ji Hyo
as soon as they step through the portal.]

1173
01:07:25,779 --> 01:07:27,338
Sorry, Ji Hyo.

1174
01:07:27,339 --> 01:07:30,525
[Everything was fine up to that point...]

1175
01:07:30,526 --> 01:07:32,529
[But Je Moon and TOP work together
to attack Mr. Capable!]

1176
01:07:32,530 --> 01:07:34,599
- Why are you doing this to me?
- One on one with him is impossible.

1177
01:07:35,573 --> 01:07:37,383
I shouldn't have ousted Ji Hyo.

1178
01:07:37,384 --> 01:07:39,222
I can see those two teaming up together.

1179
01:07:39,223 --> 01:07:41,721
Kim Jong Kook needs to get ousted.

1180
01:07:44,882 --> 01:07:48,069
[An unavoidable battle in an attempt
to rescue Dorothy.]

1181
01:07:48,070 --> 01:07:50,629
[Who will be the final member to be
eliminated in this third round?]

1182
01:07:50,630 --> 01:07:52,344
[Scary Je Moon vs. Mr. Capable Jong Kook.]

1183
01:07:54,548 --> 01:07:58,415
[The two powerhouses collide!]

1184
01:07:58,416 --> 01:08:00,392
[Just then...
TOP springs his attack on Jong Kook!]

1185
01:08:02,645 --> 01:08:03,767
That's right.

1186
01:08:06,303 --> 01:08:08,437
[TOP gets his hand on
Mr. Capable's name tag!]

1187
01:08:15,163 --> 01:08:17,827
[TOP eliminates Mr. Capable's name tag!]

1188
01:08:21,514 --> 01:08:23,865
Jong Kook is ousted.
That's right!

1189
01:08:23,866 --> 01:08:25,377
[Satisfied]

1190
01:08:25,378 --> 01:08:28,307
[The final two survivors-
Yoon Je Moon and TOP.]

1191
01:08:28,308 --> 01:08:31,639
[Dreaming of himself winning again.]

1192
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:34,808
Okay, Yoo Jung.
There are only two of them left alive now.

1193
01:08:34,809 --> 01:08:36,619
It's time for us to finally step in.

1194
01:08:36,991 --> 01:08:39,349
- Let's go!
- I'm going to win.

1195
01:08:39,350 --> 01:08:43,711
I told you that you can't win.
Please remember that you're my hostage!

1196
01:08:44,313 --> 01:08:45,985
Seriously, Yoo Jung!

1197
01:08:45,986 --> 01:08:47,628
Why do you look so happy?

1198
01:08:47,629 --> 01:08:51,262
- I beat you earlier too.
- I told you that I gave you a break.

1199
01:08:52,016 --> 01:08:54,411
You're my hostage.
You have to remember that, okay?

1200
01:08:55,919 --> 01:08:59,163
[Oh... finally escapes confinement.]

1201
01:08:59,164 --> 01:09:00,744
Remember that you're a hostage.

1202
01:09:00,835 --> 01:09:03,693
- I'm going to win.
- You.

1203
01:09:03,694 --> 01:09:08,147
- I told you that you're a hostage.
- I'll eliminate everyone's name tag.

1204
01:09:10,187 --> 01:09:12,351
Open... portal!

1205
01:09:13,615 --> 01:09:14,990
The door's a little creaky, isn't it?

1206
01:09:18,076 --> 01:09:19,983
There they are.
There you guys are.

1207
01:09:19,984 --> 01:09:23,787
[Finally... faces off with the survivors.]

1208
01:09:24,351 --> 01:09:26,013
- Save me.
- Take a good look.

1209
01:09:26,014 --> 01:09:27,879
What is this that I have in my hand?

1210
01:09:27,880 --> 01:09:29,338
[Threatening them with her name tag
in his hand.]

1211
01:09:29,338 --> 01:09:31,425
I have Yoo Jung's name tag in my grasp.

1212
01:09:31,812 --> 01:09:33,159
TOP.

1213
01:09:33,160 --> 01:09:35,488
Don't you want to save your sister?

1214
01:09:35,726 --> 01:09:37,697
- Yes, I want to save her.
- Do you want to save her?

1215
01:09:37,698 --> 01:09:39,785
- We have to go back home.
- Right?

1216
01:09:40,053 --> 01:09:42,252
TOP, I'm going to give you an order.

1217
01:09:42,253 --> 01:09:48,361
Unless you want to lose your sister...
eliminate Yoon Je Moon right now.

1218
01:09:48,362 --> 01:09:50,519
[Eliminate Je Moon's name tag!]

1219
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:54,073
Right now!
Or else, I'm ripping off her name tag!

1220
01:09:54,074 --> 01:09:55,358
[Dorothy is still excited.]

1221
01:09:55,816 --> 01:09:58,388
Wait, Suk Jin.
What if I eliminate him instead?

1222
01:09:59,219 --> 01:10:02,874
- If you do, then you'd win.
- Then why aren't you giving me that order?

1223
01:10:03,896 --> 01:10:06,573
[Ah... he didn't think that far ahead...]

1224
01:10:07,962 --> 01:10:09,275
Doto.

1225
01:10:09,652 --> 01:10:11,145
Come over here.

1226
01:10:12,276 --> 01:10:15,100
[An unavoidable battle in order
to rescue Dorothy.]

1227
01:10:17,640 --> 01:10:21,157
[Just who will be the final survivor that
will have to face off with the wizard?]

1228
01:10:23,341 --> 01:10:25,012
This is exciting.

1229
01:10:26,354 --> 01:10:28,240
Je Moon's got some moves.

1230
01:10:30,165 --> 01:10:33,293
[Doto TOP is immobilized!]

1231
01:10:33,294 --> 01:10:35,993
[But he won't be that easy
to take down...]

1232
01:10:40,779 --> 01:10:44,415
[Je Moon vs. TOP!
Who will be the victor?]

1233
01:10:52,350 --> 01:10:53,307
[Simultaneously grabs each
other's name tags...]

1234
01:10:53,308 --> 01:10:56,176
[But TOP is quicker!]

1235
01:10:57,619 --> 01:10:59,922
[As soon as the victor is determined,
wizard makes his move!]

1236
01:11:02,960 --> 01:11:05,621
[How did that happen?]

1237
01:11:06,304 --> 01:11:07,768
Let me put it back on first.

1238
01:11:09,485 --> 01:11:12,420
[Big-nosed Wizard really cramping
everyone's style.]

1239
01:11:13,546 --> 01:11:17,932
TOP can grab and hold onto Suk Jin,
and Yoo Jung can rip off the name tag.

1240
01:11:20,350 --> 01:11:23,653
[Easy prey Big-nose vs.
TOP and Dorothy siblings.]

1241
01:11:23,654 --> 01:11:25,573
This is my third year on Running Man.

1242
01:11:27,796 --> 01:11:29,814
Grab him.
Grab him by his clothes.

1243
01:11:29,815 --> 01:11:31,816
Grab his clothes,
grab his arms.

1244
01:11:34,817 --> 01:11:37,700
[TOP gets his hand on Big-nose's
name tag!]

1245
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:48,247
[Big-nosed wizard eliminates
TOP's name tag instead!]

1246
01:11:49,372 --> 01:11:53,006
[A result that no one could've
predicted!]

1247
01:11:53,007 --> 01:11:55,680
This is the wisdom that comes from
three years of being on Running Man.

1248
01:11:55,681 --> 01:11:58,505
- I thought I had him.
- You thought you had me, didn't you?

1249
01:12:01,320 --> 01:12:02,841
Why don't you have a
seat over there?

1250
01:12:02,842 --> 01:12:06,113
[It's now Wizard Big-nose vs.
Dorothy Yoo Jung.]

1251
01:12:06,114 --> 01:12:07,148
It's down to you and I now.

1252
01:12:09,019 --> 01:12:11,393
[Acting like a brat in front of his opponent.]

1253
01:12:12,409 --> 01:12:15,754
- He's cheating with his clothes.
- It's his clothes.

1254
01:12:15,755 --> 01:12:19,041
- His cape makes it impossible to rip off.
- The cape constantly gets in the way.

1255
01:12:20,351 --> 01:12:23,491
You have no idea how bothersome this is.
It's hard having to hold onto it.

1256
01:12:23,492 --> 01:12:25,875
- Then just take it off.
- Can I borrow your jacket then?

1257
01:12:26,433 --> 01:12:29,154
- Lend me your jacket then.
- Then have a rematch with TOP.

1258
01:12:30,528 --> 01:12:32,799
- I can't do that.
- I'll lend you my jacket.

1259
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:34,389
That's not right.

1260
01:12:35,889 --> 01:12:39,866
[Now's my chance!]

1261
01:12:39,867 --> 01:12:43,878
[Easy prey, Mr. Wizard...]

1262
01:12:43,879 --> 01:12:46,257
[Sorry!]

1263
01:12:49,232 --> 01:12:51,464
[Dorothy Yoo Jung takes his
cape away from him!]

1264
01:12:51,465 --> 01:12:53,887
[If she rips off his name tag...]

1265
01:12:58,701 --> 01:13:03,800
[How many times...
have I told you that the victory is mine!]

1266
01:13:03,801 --> 01:13:07,375
[Dorothy Yoo Jung eliminates
Big-nosed Wizard's name tag!]

1267
01:13:07,376 --> 01:13:12,980
[Dorothy siblings... finally... get it done!]

1268
01:13:13,621 --> 01:13:15,565
[After being had by Yoo Jung all day...]

1269
01:13:19,725 --> 01:13:20,857
You won?

1270
01:13:20,858 --> 01:13:22,674
Three rings?

1271
01:13:22,979 --> 01:13:24,660
Love, courage and wisdom.

1272
01:13:24,661 --> 01:13:26,037
[All three gold rings are given
to Dorothy for her victory!]

1273
01:13:26,038 --> 01:13:27,925
I have to find wisdom!
I'm just a scarecrow!

1274
01:13:27,926 --> 01:13:30,824
- I have to find my courage too.
- I can't live like an idiot like this forever!

1275
01:13:31,235 --> 01:13:34,064
- I have no courage.
- What are you going to do with the rings?

1276
01:13:34,065 --> 01:13:35,968
How don't the three of us split them?

1277
01:13:35,969 --> 01:13:38,660
[What a blatant request!]

1278
01:13:38,661 --> 01:13:41,198
- What's wrong with you?
- Why are you being so greedy?

1279
01:13:43,836 --> 01:13:47,909
[He ends up taking one...
to put it on his finger.]

1280
01:13:48,953 --> 01:13:50,405
It doesn't even fit you.

1281
01:13:51,292 --> 01:13:52,655
Give me mine.

1282
01:13:53,200 --> 01:13:55,921
[TOP's no different...]

1283
01:13:57,342 --> 01:13:59,800
We're all on the same boat anyway.

1284
01:13:59,801 --> 01:14:02,104
Did you see how Je Moon
isn't saying a word now?

1285
01:14:02,105 --> 01:14:04,572
First time he's been quite today.
He's not muttering a word.

1286
01:14:06,232 --> 01:14:10,426
[Thus, Dorothy and her friends
lived happily ever after.]

1287
01:14:12,703 --> 01:14:15,894
One.
One, two, three.

1288
01:14:20,499 --> 01:14:26,322
['L' Outlet in Chungcheon.]

1289
01:14:26,323 --> 01:14:28,009
There it is.

1290
01:14:29,628 --> 01:14:33,308
[Basketball mania, Haroro...
coming out in a baseball uniform?]

1291
01:14:36,840 --> 01:14:38,621
[Catcher is, Catcher Kwang-vatar.]

1292
01:14:39,389 --> 01:14:42,865
<i>A special gift will be given to the person
who does the best opening ceremony act.</i>

1293
01:14:43,231 --> 01:14:45,493
[Immediately jumps into the air.]

1294
01:14:46,997 --> 01:14:49,107
[Gets the crowd involved.]

1295
01:14:52,421 --> 01:14:54,939
[Running Man opening act contest.]

1296
01:14:55,837 --> 01:14:57,144
Fighting!

1297
01:15:03,099 --> 01:15:05,373
Don't I have to give you
some sort of a signal?

1298
01:15:05,716 --> 01:15:08,236
- You're supposed to do it first?
- I have to signal to you what to do.

1299
01:15:08,723 --> 01:15:12,475
[Exchanging signals like real
baseballs players do.]

1300
01:15:15,554 --> 01:15:18,789
[Not seeming to understand each other.]

1301
01:15:20,413 --> 01:15:24,070
[Finally explodes.]

1302
01:15:25,669 --> 01:15:27,161
What did I do!

1303
01:15:29,913 --> 01:15:32,398
[Going to signal exchange to
foot kicking exchange.]

1304
01:15:35,694 --> 01:15:37,154
I'm sorry.

1305
01:15:38,354 --> 01:15:41,589
[Please do it right this time...]

1306
01:15:49,479 --> 01:15:52,338
[Breaks out in a loud and
obnoxious scream.]

1307
01:15:55,450 --> 01:15:56,694
Go easy.

1308
01:15:57,808 --> 01:15:59,163
Please go easy.

1309
01:16:07,111 --> 01:16:10,675
[Catch... the ball!]

1310
01:16:15,524 --> 01:16:17,962
[Not a very good acting job.]

1311
01:16:19,763 --> 01:16:23,208
[The duo showing off their
perfectly harmonized act.]

1312
01:16:26,801 --> 01:16:27,861
- Hey!
- What!

1313
01:16:27,862 --> 01:16:29,886
How many hours is it going to
take you to throw that ball?

1314
01:16:29,887 --> 01:16:32,417
Do you know how many of us
are waiting back there?

1315
01:16:32,418 --> 01:16:33,856
Go away!

1316
01:16:33,857 --> 01:16:36,128
You guys can't even play baseball!
Go away!

1317
01:16:36,816 --> 01:16:40,534
- Why are you suddenly making us pitch?
- Is our guest a baseball player?

1318
01:16:40,535 --> 01:16:42,247
- Ryu Hyun Jin?
- Is it Ryu Hyun Jin?

1319
01:16:42,248 --> 01:16:45,517
[Can it be... The infamous
'Korean Monster', Ryu Hyun Jin?]

1320
01:16:45,518 --> 01:16:46,990
- Could it be Ryu Hyun Jin?
- You think?

1321
01:16:46,991 --> 01:16:48,952
- What if it's Clara?
- Ryu Hyun Jin!

1322
01:16:48,953 --> 01:16:52,320
Please come on out!

1323
01:16:52,321 --> 01:16:53,654
Who is it?

1324
01:17:00,035 --> 01:17:01,680
[Hollywood?]

1325
01:17:01,681 --> 01:17:03,889
[Los Angeles?]

1326
01:17:03,890 --> 01:17:05,900
[Is it really Ryu Hyun Jin?]

1327
01:17:05,901 --> 01:17:07,373
See?
That's L.A.!

1328
01:17:08,090 --> 01:17:10,714
[L.A.- America.]

1329
01:17:13,410 --> 01:17:15,982
[It really is L.A.!]

1330
01:17:19,423 --> 01:17:21,158
[Oh!]

1331
01:17:23,193 --> 01:17:24,751
It's Hyun Jin!

1332
01:17:24,752 --> 01:17:26,523
[A clear view of his name
and his number.]

1333
01:17:28,626 --> 01:17:30,549
[Ryu Hyun Jin's L.A. home.]

1334
01:17:35,128 --> 01:17:36,892
See? He just pressed
the doorbell with his left hand!

1335
01:17:36,893 --> 01:17:38,633
- He could be just another big guy.
- Are we going to L.A.?

1336
01:17:43,905 --> 01:17:47,683
[Huh?
That's the real Ryu Hyun Jin!]

1337
01:17:47,684 --> 01:17:49,501
['Korean Monster', Ryu Hyun Jin!]

1338
01:17:51,815 --> 01:17:54,067
[A player for a major
American baseball league!]

1339
01:17:54,068 --> 01:17:55,513
[Korean Monster!]

1340
01:17:56,135 --> 01:17:57,651
[First debut season,
and came in at 14th place!]

1341
01:17:57,652 --> 01:17:59,837
[A major league player!
An astounding achievement!]

1342
01:18:00,118 --> 01:18:01,498
What are you doing here?

1343
01:18:02,492 --> 01:18:04,656
- It is Hyun Jin!
- It really is Ryu Hyun Jin!

1344
01:18:05,192 --> 01:18:07,412
- You too!
- Hyun Jin!

1345
01:18:08,746 --> 01:18:10,225
I don't know why I'm laughing.

1346
01:18:10,226 --> 01:18:12,276
This is your first mission.

1347
01:18:12,835 --> 01:18:14,782
You have to show me around
your house.

1348
01:18:15,535 --> 01:18:17,362
My house?
Why?

1349
01:18:19,596 --> 01:18:21,398
Because I came all the way
to America.

1350
01:18:21,399 --> 01:18:22,924
Okay.
Come on in.

1351
01:18:24,858 --> 01:18:27,656
[For the first time ever,
a peek inside Ryu Hyun Jin's L.A. life!]

1352
01:18:28,131 --> 01:18:30,541
Just go wherever you'd like to go.

1353
01:18:30,542 --> 01:18:33,787
In that case...
let's go into the living room first.

1354
01:18:33,788 --> 01:18:35,468
Please come this way.

1355
01:18:35,469 --> 01:18:37,149
[A first look into Ryu Hyun Jin's
L.A. home living room.]

1356
01:18:41,039 --> 01:18:43,470
This is my living room.

1357
01:18:47,065 --> 01:18:48,525
Who's that gentleman?

1358
01:18:48,526 --> 01:18:52,989
This is Ryu Hyun Soo.
He's actually my real brother.

1359
01:18:53,919 --> 01:18:56,467
- Hello.
- What are you doing!

1360
01:18:59,121 --> 01:19:05,605
Just until recently...
both my mom and dad were here too.

1361
01:19:05,606 --> 01:19:09,038
They went back to Korea recently,
and now it's just my brother and I.

1362
01:19:09,039 --> 01:19:14,068
It's just the two of us left here now.
Since the season is over now...

1363
01:19:15,153 --> 01:19:18,255
I'm thinking of returning back to
Korea pretty soon myself.

1364
01:19:18,592 --> 01:19:22,123
[The view is pretty nice...]

1365
01:19:23,199 --> 01:19:25,936
But if you see over here...

1366
01:19:27,187 --> 01:19:29,164
If you look into that distance,
it's the ocean.

1367
01:19:29,165 --> 01:19:34,886
And on a really clear day,
you can see all the way to the ocean.

1368
01:19:34,887 --> 01:19:36,602
So it's really nice.

1369
01:19:36,603 --> 01:19:38,533
<i>What's that ball over there?</i>

1370
01:19:38,534 --> 01:19:40,636
- That one over there.
- That ball?

1371
01:19:41,746 --> 01:19:47,557
That's the game ball from my
first game that I won in.

1372
01:19:47,558 --> 01:19:53,465
So I took that ball to remember
my first win in the major leagues.

1373
01:19:54,063 --> 01:20:00,643
And these bats...
When I played against Arizona...

1374
01:20:00,644 --> 01:20:03,568
This is the bat I used to hit
my winning hit.

1375
01:20:03,569 --> 01:20:09,146
So my clubhouse manager gave this
to me in commemoration.

1376
01:20:09,147 --> 01:20:11,603
This one is Shin Soo's bat.

1377
01:20:12,346 --> 01:20:14,474
Shin Soo signed it himself.

1378
01:20:14,475 --> 01:20:16,109
So I keep it as a keepsake.

1379
01:20:16,623 --> 01:20:18,505
<i>Is that your family photo?</i>

1380
01:20:18,506 --> 01:20:22,612
That one?
We took that last winter.

1381
01:20:23,416 --> 01:20:25,024
We took that picture last winter.

1382
01:20:25,025 --> 01:20:26,759
But I think we need a new picture.

1383
01:20:26,760 --> 01:20:29,354
- Why?
- I look too fat in it.

1384
01:20:31,276 --> 01:20:33,672
[What a loving family picture.]

1385
01:20:33,673 --> 01:20:36,104
He looks skinnier in that picture
than he looks in person.

1386
01:20:40,387 --> 01:20:43,557
- What are all these newspapers for?
- We don't really read them.

1387
01:20:43,558 --> 01:20:45,025
We don't really read them.

1388
01:20:45,026 --> 01:20:47,116
[He seems to like seeing himself
in the headlines?]

1389
01:20:48,723 --> 01:20:50,699
I do all the reading on the internet.

1390
01:20:51,882 --> 01:20:53,915
How do you feel when you see
your name in the papers?

1391
01:20:53,916 --> 01:20:59,139
I make sure to keep up with the news
when I'm doing well.

1392
01:20:59,140 --> 01:21:01,855
But I don't read the news
when I haven't played very well.

1393
01:21:02,345 --> 01:21:03,747
- On purpose?
- On purpose.

1394
01:21:03,748 --> 01:21:06,659
Since they're not going to say anything
nice when I lose, right?

1395
01:21:07,032 --> 01:21:10,179
- So I tend not to read it then.
- Do you normally care about those things?

1396
01:21:11,107 --> 01:21:12,433
No.

1397
01:21:12,434 --> 01:21:17,578
I'm not really like that.
But since so many people are watching...

1398
01:21:18,735 --> 01:21:22,723
I feel very blessed.
Especially with so many Koreans in L.A.

1399
01:21:23,280 --> 01:21:25,270
Do you see that white building
over there?

1400
01:21:26,894 --> 01:21:28,948
If you look right next to that building...

1401
01:21:29,570 --> 01:21:33,576
Do you see that light next to it?
It's a square shape.

1402
01:21:34,588 --> 01:21:36,446
That's our baseball field.

1403
01:21:37,087 --> 01:21:40,934
You can see the fireworks going off from
there after the game on Fridays.

1404
01:21:42,137 --> 01:21:44,351
That only happens on Fridays.

1405
01:21:44,871 --> 01:21:47,529
You can come over to my
house on Friday.

1406
01:21:52,288 --> 01:21:56,647
[The place they can see
from Ryu Hyun Jin's house.]

1407
01:22:02,640 --> 01:22:05,878
[L.A. Dodger's Stadium!]

1408
01:22:12,625 --> 01:22:14,797
Are you staying in town,
or are you going back to Korea?

1409
01:22:15,882 --> 01:22:18,914
- I'm going back next week.
- Next week?

1410
01:22:18,915 --> 01:22:21,431
- Have a good time. See you next year.
- Thank you.

1411
01:22:25,325 --> 01:22:28,009
- I can do at least that much.
- That was impressive.

1412
01:22:29,525 --> 01:22:32,153
That's the parking garage over there.

1413
01:22:33,735 --> 01:22:36,967
[A parking garage of immense size
once they enter the stadium!]

1414
01:22:38,550 --> 01:22:41,387
[Epic proportions!]

1415
01:22:41,388 --> 01:22:43,716
Sometimes they even run out
of parking spaces.

1416
01:22:43,717 --> 01:22:45,609
[Even with that size,
sometimes it's not enough!]

1417
01:22:51,753 --> 01:22:56,137
[As they cross over the parking lot...
they finally see the stadium in front!]

1418
01:23:02,281 --> 01:23:05,045
[Entering the player's parking lot.]

1419
01:23:08,546 --> 01:23:09,950
What's up?

1420
01:23:11,733 --> 01:23:13,373
- How are you?
- Good.

1421
01:23:13,374 --> 01:23:15,043
[Martin Kim- Dormitory Manager.]

1422
01:23:17,839 --> 01:23:20,500
[Time to enter the stadium!]

1423
01:23:20,501 --> 01:23:21,998
Look at my hair.

1424
01:23:31,126 --> 01:23:34,225
[Entering the players' locker room
inside the stadium.]

1425
01:23:34,754 --> 01:23:37,822
The locker room is completely empty.
The players' took their belongings home.

1426
01:23:43,608 --> 01:23:45,034
This is my spot.

1427
01:23:46,436 --> 01:23:48,322
Ryu.
Number 99.

1428
01:23:48,323 --> 01:23:50,414
[Korean Monster, Ryu Hyun Jin's locker.]

1429
01:23:50,732 --> 01:23:55,388
And this is our team's Ace,
Kershaw's locker.

1430
01:23:55,423 --> 01:23:57,532
Who else can I tell you about?

1431
01:24:00,015 --> 01:24:02,167
- How about someone you're friends with?
- Okay.

1432
01:24:03,625 --> 01:24:06,768
This is my friend, Uribe's locker.

1433
01:24:06,769 --> 01:24:09,588
Isn't his locker big?
Veteran player's lockers are bigger.

1434
01:24:09,589 --> 01:24:11,047
[Veteran players' lockers are bigger.]

1435
01:24:11,048 --> 01:24:13,939
This is Matt Kemp's locker.

1436
01:24:15,942 --> 01:24:18,170
What about over at the end there?

1437
01:24:18,867 --> 01:24:20,797
No, we don't have to go over there.

1438
01:24:22,398 --> 01:24:25,084
I want to give each of the
Running Man members a hat.

1439
01:24:26,784 --> 01:24:28,996
[Hyun Jin packs up the hats in the boxes.]

1440
01:24:28,997 --> 01:24:30,814
This is a woman's size.

1441
01:24:34,215 --> 01:24:35,449
Bye.

1442
01:24:37,980 --> 01:24:41,340
[Making sure to say his goodbyes to everyone
as he makes his way out.]

1443
01:24:48,199 --> 01:24:50,385
I'm just going to give the hat
to Ji Hyo only.

1444
01:24:53,278 --> 01:24:54,721
I think we're done with all
the introductions now.

1445
01:24:54,722 --> 01:25:00,885
What is it that I have to do now since
you came all the way to America?

1446
01:25:01,944 --> 01:25:03,788
<i>There is a mission for you.</i>

1447
01:25:04,434 --> 01:25:05,844
<i>First...</i>

1448
01:25:09,776 --> 01:25:12,619
- Isn't that for superpowers?
- It's a magical potion.

1449
01:25:12,620 --> 01:25:17,109
<i>Once you drink this potion, you'll activate
your power to control Running Man members.</i>

1450
01:25:17,861 --> 01:25:21,007
Really?
I can do that if I drink this?

1451
01:25:21,931 --> 01:25:23,108
Come on, Hyun Jin.

1452
01:25:23,109 --> 01:25:25,881
<i>But you have to chant out a spell
once you finish drinking your potion.</i>

1453
01:25:27,910 --> 01:25:29,437
<i>That's the only way to activate
your powers.</i>

1454
01:25:31,996 --> 01:25:33,543
Go away.
Get out of here.

1455
01:25:33,544 --> 01:25:34,747
Hurry up and go away.

1456
01:25:34,748 --> 01:25:38,120
[Getting rid of his brother because he's
too embarrassed to have him witness it?]

1457
01:25:38,121 --> 01:25:40,319
Why are you acting embarrassed about it?

1458
01:25:42,128 --> 01:25:44,532
- Having to chant out a spell like that.
- That's not easy to do.

1459
01:25:44,533 --> 01:25:46,685
I think I'd be too embarrassed to do it
in front of my own wife too.

1460
01:25:59,551 --> 01:26:01,294
[Now...]

1461
01:26:01,295 --> 01:26:04,367
The one who controls Running Man!

1462
01:26:04,368 --> 01:26:07,087
The one who controls Running Man!

1463
01:26:10,966 --> 01:26:14,885
The one who controls Running Man!

1464
01:26:16,531 --> 01:26:19,279
[Superpower activated!]

1465
01:26:23,559 --> 01:26:27,744
Then I'm now the king of Running Man?

1466
01:26:27,745 --> 01:26:31,116
Then can I do whatever I
want to do now?

1467
01:26:31,152 --> 01:26:33,015
<i>For the next entire episode...</i>

1468
01:26:33,016 --> 01:26:37,375
<i>you have been given the ability to determine
