determine all your fates.

making in several different situations.]

the correct guesses that you've made.

Run!
Quickly! Kim Jong Kook!

95
00:05:53,733 --> 00:05:55,105
I'm coming to get you!

96
00:05:57,338 --> 00:05:59,931
- You two seem to be very close.
- No, it's not that.

97
00:05:59,932 --> 00:06:02,281
It's just because he eliminated
my name tag the last time that he was on.

98
00:06:02,282 --> 00:06:05,707
- I don't think he's afraid of me.
- He needs to do it again.

99
00:06:05,708 --> 00:06:06,927
I don't think he's afraid.

100
00:06:06,928 --> 00:06:11,011

on the choices Ryu Hyun Jin will be giving you.</i>

102
00:06:16,949 --> 00:06:20,069
- So you'll have to choose one of the two.
- So it's a 50/50 chance?

103
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:24,513
<i>Thus, if you answer the question correctly,
you'll be given an easy mission to do.</i>

104
00:06:24,514 --> 00:06:27,753
- I understand.
- Get it wrong, and you get a tough mission.

105
00:06:27,754 --> 00:06:30,745
<i>You have to discuss it with your teammates
to choose the right answer.</i>

106
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:33,816
<i>Okay, here comes your first question.</i>

107
00:06:33,817 --> 00:06:36,140
- A question from Ryu Hyun Jin himself.
- I'm really curious now.

108
00:06:38,317 --> 00:06:40,740
[Huh? Hoola hoop?]

109
00:06:42,353 --> 00:06:45,501
- He's not good at it either.
- He can't do it either. Fatso's not good.

110
00:06:45,502 --> 00:06:47,020
Your skills are on par with
Kim Jong Kook's.

111
00:06:47,021 --> 00:06:48,869
- Excuse me?
- Your skills are on par with Kim Jong Kook's.

112
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:50,405
No way.

113
00:06:50,406 --> 00:06:52,560
I have to be better than
Jong Kook at this.

114
00:06:52,561 --> 00:06:54,681
[Tiger Jong Kook doesn't seem to
put any fear into Hyun Jin?]

115
00:06:57,122 --> 00:06:59,422
<i>- He really is bad at that.
- I think I'm better than him.</i>

116
00:07:00,492 --> 00:07:02,549
Why don't you try it with this one?

117
00:07:03,252 --> 00:07:05,534
- That's really hard.
- Doesn't that one hurt?

118
00:07:05,535 --> 00:07:08,073
I'm going to be doing the hoola hoop
with this one now.

119
00:07:09,242 --> 00:07:13,526
Depending on how many times or
how long I'll be able to spin this for

120
00:07:13,527 --> 00:07:19,012
the fate of your mission will
hang on the balance of your guesses.

121
00:07:19,013 --> 00:07:23,068
[How many spins will Ryu Hyun Jin be able to
get from the acupuncture hoola hoop?]

122
00:07:23,646 --> 00:07:25,755
Can I wrap a towel around my waist first?

123
00:07:25,756 --> 00:07:27,835
- Can I use a towel underneath?
- Doing that really hurts.

124
00:07:27,836 --> 00:07:30,493
- Let me think about this.
- He can't really handle pain very well.

125
00:07:30,494 --> 00:07:33,766
- Three, four, five... he's really good.
- How are you doing that?

126
00:07:34,654 --> 00:07:36,794
- Why don't you keep going?
- It's because you're fat.

127
00:07:40,946 --> 00:07:47,230
[Will Ryun Hyun Jin... be able
to last for more than 30 seconds?]

130
00:07:53,739 --> 00:07:57,088
[A. Can do it.]
[B. Can't do it.]

131
00:07:57,089 --> 00:07:59,222
He can do it.
I say that he can do it.

132
00:07:59,223 --> 00:08:01,156
- Why do you think that?
- Hyun Jin is pretty limber.

133
00:08:01,596 --> 00:08:04,891
- How would you know that?
- And he could've been faking us earlier.

134
00:08:04,892 --> 00:08:07,765
I don't think he can do it.
That hoola hoop really hurts.

135
00:08:07,766 --> 00:08:09,611
- I think he can do it.
- What do you think, Ji Hyo?

136
00:08:09,937 --> 00:08:11,600
I...

137
00:08:12,422 --> 00:08:13,620
What am I?

138
00:08:14,243 --> 00:08:17,421
- Forget it. Pass.
- You're Blank Ji Hyo.

139
00:08:17,422 --> 00:08:20,294
- You're just Blank Ji Hyo.
- You're so frustrating!

140
00:08:20,295 --> 00:08:22,307
- Can do it or not?
- I don't think he can do it.

141
00:08:23,849 --> 00:08:25,924
- Just leave her alone.
- Pass.

142
00:08:26,387 --> 00:08:28,228
- I don't think he can do it.
- Can't do it.

143
00:08:28,229 --> 00:08:30,627
- Ryun Hyun Jin can do anything.
- He can do it!

144
00:08:30,628 --> 00:08:32,786
I think he can do it too.
It's three to three.

145
00:08:32,787 --> 00:08:34,553
This hangs on your decision, Ji Hyo.

146
00:08:34,554 --> 00:08:36,083
- Hey.
- She doesn't even know what's going on.

147
00:08:36,084 --> 00:08:39,362
- She doesn't even know who she is right now.
- I don't think he can do it either.

148
00:08:39,363 --> 00:08:41,546
- He can't do it.
- Okay, we'll go with 'Can't do it'.

149
00:08:41,547 --> 00:08:42,962
On the count of three.

150
00:08:43,661 --> 00:08:47,592
One, two, three.
B. He can't do it!

151
00:08:47,593 --> 00:08:50,524
[B. He can't last for 30 seconds.]

152
00:08:50,525 --> 00:08:52,594
Okay, someone take this.

153
00:08:52,595 --> 00:08:54,749
[Given the 'B' mission.]

154
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:57,381

we won't be giving you any breaks.</i>

158
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:06,064
<i>You'll have to complete the mission
no matter how long it takes you.</i>

159
00:09:06,065 --> 00:09:08,602
- You have to keep going until you succeed.
- It must be a tough mission.

160
00:09:08,603 --> 00:09:10,740
We could be doing this until tomorrow.
Let's all do this!

00:09:12,849 --> 00:09:14,994
[B- Geum River ferry.]

163
00:09:14,995 --> 00:09:16,968
March forward!
Geum river ferry.

164
00:09:20,306 --> 00:09:23,531
[They can verify their answer only when
they arrive at their destination.]

165
00:09:23,532 --> 00:09:27,955
[It would be more advantageous for
Running Man if they chose the correct answer.]

166
00:09:29,345 --> 00:09:32,116
- I noticed that he lost a lot of weight.
- Yeah, he did.

167
00:09:33,098 --> 00:09:35,445
- He's pretty stubborn too.
- You're right.

168
00:09:35,446 --> 00:09:38,164
[He may be able to do it with
the determination of an athlete.]

169
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:42,192
But it's so nice for everyone to be going
together which we haven't done in a while.

170
00:09:42,193 --> 00:09:43,843
- I like the group missions.
- I agree.

171
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,703
- There's a bee. Kang Gary, there's a bee.
- Be careful.

172
00:09:47,704 --> 00:09:49,135
[A bee?]

173
00:09:50,383 --> 00:09:52,642
Don't do it!
No, don't do it!

174
00:09:52,643 --> 00:09:55,394
- Don't do it, Kwang Soo.
- Don't kill it.

175
00:09:55,395 --> 00:09:58,051
- You can't kill it.
- Just leave it alone.

176
00:09:59,044 --> 00:10:01,699
- You'll be punished if you do.
- Watch out for the camera.

177
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,846
[Worried about the camera.]

178
00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:07,818
[Worry about the camera...
and worry about the bee...]

179
00:10:07,819 --> 00:10:11,640
[A loud and chaotic Running Man car.]

180
00:10:12,893 --> 00:10:15,534
This feels like a really
awkward family outing.

181
00:10:15,535 --> 00:10:18,965
[Feels like a first awkward outing
for the Running Man family?]

182
00:10:18,966 --> 00:10:21,504
It really feels like that.

183
00:10:22,741 --> 00:10:25,275
[Beautiful fall scenery.]

184
00:10:25,276 --> 00:10:27,439
- Wow! What's that?
- Look at that!

185
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:35,574
- Are we going to have to get on that?
- What's that forklift for?

186
00:10:35,575 --> 00:10:38,010
- I'm getting a bad feeling about this.
- I see a forklift.

187
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:41,115
[Mini baseball field...]

188
00:10:42,565 --> 00:10:45,879
[And a forklift?]

189
00:10:46,728 --> 00:10:48,277
It's baseball.

190
00:10:51,293 --> 00:10:53,448
But what is that forklift
doing here?

191
00:10:54,898 --> 00:11:01,440
[Why is a chair attached to a forklift?]

192
00:11:01,441 --> 00:11:03,548
- Did we get the right answer or not?
- I'm getting really nervous.

193
00:11:03,549 --> 00:11:05,410
Did we get the right answer or not?

194
00:11:05,411 --> 00:11:09,514
[Correct answer, then an easy mission.
Wrong answer, then a tough mission.]

195
00:11:10,494 --> 00:11:13,276
[Running Man chose answer 'B'.
They can't change their decision.]

196
00:11:13,277 --> 00:11:16,887
[The correct answer is?]

197
00:11:16,888 --> 00:11:21,088
[Did Ryu Hyun Jin pull it off?
A- Can do it. B- Can't do it.]

198
00:11:21,089 --> 00:11:22,762
- There he goes.
- He's doing good.

199
00:11:22,763 --> 00:11:24,876
- Look he's doing a good job.
- Look at him go.

200
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,239
This really hurts.

201
00:11:32,635 --> 00:11:35,756
[The power of the acupuncture hoola hoop
that makes the man scream out in pain.]

202
00:11:41,529 --> 00:11:45,695
[Running Man members are slowly starting to
get more and more nervous about their fate.]

203
00:11:45,696 --> 00:11:48,105
I think it's starting to fall off.

204
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:54,094
[Danger!]

205
00:11:54,095 --> 00:11:57,564
[He endures the pain to keep spinning.]

206
00:11:58,329 --> 00:12:00,629
[Almost to the 30 second mark!]

207
00:12:02,317 --> 00:12:04,930
[Ryu Hyun Jin breaks through
the 30 second mark!]

208
00:12:04,931 --> 00:12:07,026
[Running Man gets it wrong.]

209
00:12:07,027 --> 00:12:08,618
He's nearing the minute mark.

210
00:12:17,006 --> 00:12:19,866
[A whole minute and 14 seconds!]

211
00:12:22,104 --> 00:12:24,140
I think this could help me lose
some weight.

212
00:12:24,141 --> 00:12:25,382
This is nice.

213
00:12:28,566 --> 00:12:32,292
As you can see,
I passed the 30 second mark.

214
00:12:33,105 --> 00:12:35,877
[The answer is, A- He can do it.]

215
00:12:35,878 --> 00:12:38,332
[Running Man gets the answer wrong.]

216
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:40,609
Hyun Jin's body is limber,
so he's good at things like that.

217
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:43,401
- What did you say earlier?
- I told you that he could do it.

218
00:12:43,402 --> 00:12:46,275
- I want you to apologize, Jong Kook.
- You just wait until you get it wrong.

219
00:12:48,645 --> 00:12:51,694
<i>Okay, had you guys gotten
the correct answer...</i>

220
00:12:51,695 --> 00:12:54,542
<i>you would've gotten a very
simple mission.</i>

221
00:12:54,543 --> 00:12:56,736
<i>You would've been able to pass it
very easily. The reason being...</i>

222
00:12:56,737 --> 00:13:02,286
<i>You would've had to receive a massage
for ten minutes without making any noise.</i>

223
00:13:03,633 --> 00:13:07,086
- That would've been so nice.
- You think it would've been a simple massage?

224
00:13:07,087 --> 00:13:09,624
This is how the massage
would've been done.

225
00:13:10,913 --> 00:13:12,560
What's the tough mission?

226
00:13:12,561 --> 00:13:14,913
[Then what is the difficult mission
that awaits the Running Man members?]

227
00:13:14,914 --> 00:13:16,271
Is the forklift going to give us
the massage?

228
00:13:16,272 --> 00:13:18,389
Is it going to scratch our back
or something?

229
00:13:19,845 --> 00:13:22,745
- What is that?
- I'm so nervous about it.

230
00:13:22,746 --> 00:13:25,055
<i>- Your mission is...
- What is it?</i>

231
00:13:25,056 --> 00:13:27,495
<i>It's called, Running League.</i>

232
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:32,334
<i>We made a makeshift baseball diamond
as you can see to your right.</i>

233
00:13:32,906 --> 00:13:35,670
<i>I think it would be better for us
to demonstrate it for you.</i>

234
00:13:35,671 --> 00:13:37,428
<i>Let us show you.</i>

235
00:13:37,429 --> 00:13:41,748
[Running League demonstration time.]

236
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:54,155
- What is that?
- I can't do that.

237
00:13:54,156 --> 00:13:57,547
- There's no way I can do that.
- How did you even think that up?

238
00:13:57,548 --> 00:13:59,705
That's going to make me so dizzy.

239
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:03,121
- He just threw it.
- We have to throw the ball?

240
00:14:03,768 --> 00:14:07,741
[Throws the ball to the catcher
on first base.]

241
00:14:07,742 --> 00:14:14,102
[Catchers two and three have to catch
the ball while holding onto each other.]

242
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:18,187
[Then throw the ball to the fifth catcher
who has to catch it with a net.]

243
00:14:18,188 --> 00:14:20,587
- They're good.
- Let's get it done in one try.

244
00:14:20,588 --> 00:14:24,656
- Let's get it done in one try.
- We have to do it until we succeed.

245
00:14:24,657 --> 00:14:28,671
<i>The ball can't fall to the ground
when the hitter hits the ball.</i>

246
00:14:28,672 --> 00:14:32,123
<i>The ball has to go up into the air
as a fly ball.</i>

247
00:14:32,124 --> 00:14:36,252
- Then Jae Suk can try doing that.
- Let me try hitting it.

248
00:14:36,868 --> 00:14:39,607
Why don't we play rock-paper-scissors
instead of you just doing it yourself?

249
00:14:39,608 --> 00:14:41,615
He just needs to hit it into the air?

250
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:46,082
[As long as someone can catch the ball
before the ball falls to the ground...]

251
00:14:46,083 --> 00:14:48,795
[And pass it onto the first thrower again!]

252
00:14:48,796 --> 00:14:51,274
- No way!
- He has to catch that ball?

253
00:14:51,275 --> 00:14:53,728
[And lastly...]

254
00:14:53,729 --> 00:14:55,763
- He has to catch that ball?
- Stop it!

255
00:14:55,764 --> 00:14:58,854
- This isn't even right.
- Are you guys playing with us?

256
00:15:03,622 --> 00:15:07,737
[And if you can catch it like this...
then the mission is a success!]

257
00:15:10,256 --> 00:15:12,340
- You expect us to do that?
- How did he do that so easily?

258
00:15:12,341 --> 00:15:14,693
- Aren't you even dizzy?
- That would count as a success.

259
00:15:14,694 --> 00:15:17,249
- Aren't you dizzy?
- He's a master at that.

260
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:21,225
Then does that mean... that the
person has to keep spinning around?

261
00:15:21,226 --> 00:15:23,229
<i>The person in the chair will keep spinning
until you succeed the mission.</i>

262
00:15:23,857 --> 00:15:26,381
- I really can't do that.
- I really can't do that.

263
00:15:26,382 --> 00:15:29,227
[Everyone's trying to avoid being
put into the forklift chair.]

264
00:15:29,228 --> 00:15:31,301
- Ji Hyo's good at things like that.
- Yeah, Ji Hyo would be best.

265
00:15:31,302 --> 00:15:34,412
- Ji Hyo's really good at things like that.
- Why are you making Ji Hyo do that?

266
00:15:34,413 --> 00:15:37,492
- Song Ji Hyo!
- I'm not good at catching things.

267
00:15:37,493 --> 00:15:40,036
<i>What's Ryu Hyun Jin's number
on his back?</i>

268
00:15:40,037 --> 00:15:42,820
- 99.
- You have to succeed within 99 seconds.

269
00:15:42,821 --> 00:15:44,274
[Must succeed within 99 seconds.]

270
00:15:44,275 --> 00:15:45,915
You're such an awful person.

271
00:15:45,916 --> 00:15:48,872
- Someone has to endure that spinning.
- Okay, I'll give it a try.

272
00:15:48,873 --> 00:15:52,278
- Okay, Gary's good at things like that too.
- I'll give it a try.

273
00:15:52,279 --> 00:15:54,521
I'll pass it onto someone
if I really can't endure it.

274
00:15:54,522 --> 00:15:57,174
- Okay, then I'll take over.
- I'll hit the ball then.

275
00:16:02,392 --> 00:16:06,431
<i>You can change your positions once
you pass the 99 second mark.</i>

276
00:16:06,432 --> 00:16:08,011
<i>- So here's your first attempt.
- Okay.</i>

277
00:16:10,317 --> 00:16:11,853
Let's try to get it done in one try.

278
00:16:11,854 --> 00:16:15,775
- You have to do this right, Jae Suk.
- Don't even worry.

279
00:16:15,776 --> 00:16:17,582
[Yoo Hyuk has the most important position
as being the first pitcher.]

280
00:16:17,583 --> 00:16:19,164
This is a very important position.

281
00:16:19,165 --> 00:16:22,116
- I have to get up there if you get it wrong.
- Don't even worry!

282
00:16:23,898 --> 00:16:26,528
[Gary sat upon the spinning chair.]

283
00:16:26,529 --> 00:16:28,275
Let's get this done in one try!

284
00:16:30,175 --> 00:16:33,065
[Start spinning the chair.]

285
00:16:44,338 --> 00:16:45,741
I'm scared!

286
00:16:48,271 --> 00:16:50,585
Play ball!

287
00:16:51,181 --> 00:16:53,141
- Catch it! Here!
- Okay!

288
00:16:55,937 --> 00:16:58,453
[Slips from the very first step...]

289
00:16:58,454 --> 00:17:01,145
- You have to throw it harder!
- Throw it lower.

290
00:17:01,146 --> 00:17:03,057
Just stay where you are!

291
00:17:05,135 --> 00:17:07,283
[Nice catch!]

292
00:17:07,284 --> 00:17:08,733
[Time for these two to catch the ball.]

293
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,802
- Hey!
- Hey!

294
00:17:14,803 --> 00:17:16,418
[Not even a chance.
Too short of a throw.]

295
00:17:16,419 --> 00:17:17,991
You have to throw it high!

296
00:17:17,992 --> 00:17:20,677
- Good! Hurry!
- Throw it high!

297
00:17:20,678 --> 00:17:22,168
There you go!

298
00:17:24,085 --> 00:17:25,367
What are you doing?

299
00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:29,461
[He's doing well catching the ball...]

300
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:36,349
[Iron chest Tiger making the ball
bounce off of his chest.]

301
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:37,925
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

302
00:17:39,794 --> 00:17:41,901
- This is hard.
- Try to do it right!

303
00:17:46,312 --> 00:17:49,053
[Oh? Finally?]

304
00:17:49,054 --> 00:17:51,565
[They caught the ball!]

305
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:55,278
[Time to throw it to the third person,
Big-nosed Brother.]

306
00:17:56,278 --> 00:17:57,680
You got it!

307
00:17:58,597 --> 00:18:00,307
[Wow!
Big-nosed Brother catches the ball!]

308
00:18:00,308 --> 00:18:01,922
Throw it easy!

309
00:18:03,329 --> 00:18:06,073
[Catcher Blank Ji- Nice catch!]

310
00:18:07,853 --> 00:18:10,531
[Time for the hitter, Ha Ha
to hit a fly ball!]

311
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:14,110
[A ground ball.]

312
00:18:14,111 --> 00:18:16,234
[Fail]

313
00:18:18,891 --> 00:18:22,141
- I think we can do it.
- You have to hit it better!

314
00:18:23,889 --> 00:18:26,968
- Seriously, what are you doing?
- You have to do better this time!

315
00:18:26,969 --> 00:18:28,795
You have to throw it harder.

316
00:18:29,593 --> 00:18:32,631
[Time for Coach Kkuk's nagging.]

317
00:18:32,632 --> 00:18:35,811
The most important thing is for you
to do your own job right!

318
00:18:35,812 --> 00:18:39,438
It's your fault that we're even doing this.
Otherwise, we'd be getting a massage!

319
00:18:39,734 --> 00:18:41,758
- Am I wrong or right?
- You're right.

320
00:18:41,759 --> 00:18:43,415
You wait until you get something wrong.

321
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:45,603
It's a relief that I haven't
gotten anything wrong.

322
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:47,650
It's a relief.

323
00:18:49,952 --> 00:18:52,013
I was a bit nervous, but
I haven't done anything wrong.

324
00:18:52,748 --> 00:18:54,149
It really is such a relief.

325
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:56,298
You think all we're going to do
is play baseball?

326
00:18:56,688 --> 00:18:59,492
- Let's just wait and see.
- You can't play soccer either!

327
00:19:01,054 --> 00:19:03,168
[Explodes!]

328
00:19:03,169 --> 00:19:05,134
You can't play soccer either.

329
00:19:05,135 --> 00:19:06,559
- Me?
- That's right.

330
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:09,534
- I think I'm better than you at soccer.
- Seriously.

331
00:19:09,535 --> 00:19:12,067
- Wait until you do something wrong.
- You can't even play soccer either.

332
00:19:12,068 --> 00:19:14,221
It's fun watching you guys
from over here.

333
00:19:16,926 --> 00:19:18,396
This is your second attempt.

334
00:19:18,397 --> 00:19:21,624
- You did good, Gary.
- Let's succeed this time!

335
00:19:21,625 --> 00:19:24,394
- Okay, let's do this.
- Running Man, fighting!

336
00:19:24,395 --> 00:19:27,152
- Fighting!
- Let's say it louder!

337
00:19:27,153 --> 00:19:29,406
I can't hear any of you.

338
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:34,109
- Those two keeps ruining it for you.
- Stop angering Jong Kook!

339
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:36,294
Everyone get on the ground!

340
00:19:36,295 --> 00:19:38,668
[Unhappy Running Man baseball team.]

341
00:19:38,669 --> 00:19:41,634
- Let's stop that fighting, and do this fighting!
- Fighting!

342
00:19:41,635 --> 00:19:43,587
[Blank Ji's fighting cry.]

343
00:19:43,588 --> 00:19:45,275
Fighting!

344
00:19:45,276 --> 00:19:47,078
Play ball!

345
00:19:49,195 --> 00:19:50,848
Fighting!

346
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:52,803
Let's do this.

347
00:19:53,655 --> 00:19:55,176
- Here I go!
- Good.

348
00:19:57,406 --> 00:19:59,561
[Every mistake that is made...]

349
00:19:59,562 --> 00:20:02,525
[Leaves the person open for
hostile attacks.]

350
00:20:02,526 --> 00:20:05,326
- Why didn't you catch that?
- Throw it. Throw it right now.

351
00:20:07,274 --> 00:20:08,518
Nice!

352
00:20:12,441 --> 00:20:15,315
[Giraffe down?]

353
00:20:15,316 --> 00:20:17,055
Hurry up and get up!

354
00:20:23,444 --> 00:20:27,451
[Second catcher, Giraffe having lost
his strength in his legs.]

355
00:20:27,452 --> 00:20:29,637
- Throw it right!
- Throw it high!

356
00:20:29,638 --> 00:20:32,074
Good.
We got this one.

357
00:20:37,293 --> 00:20:39,459
[Drops it again...]

358
00:20:46,073 --> 00:20:48,606
[The duo has awful teamwork skills.]

359
00:20:48,607 --> 00:20:50,933
- Wait a second.
- What are you guys doing!

360
00:20:51,976 --> 00:20:54,552
Kwang Soo keeps trying to catch it
on his own instead of together.

361
00:20:54,553 --> 00:20:56,610
[They fail the second attempt.]

362
00:20:56,611 --> 00:20:58,358
Here, Jong Kook.
You can take this.

363
00:20:58,359 --> 00:21:01,382
- But he's...
- Just go and take the net.

364
00:21:01,383 --> 00:21:03,754
[The Iron Tiger is swapped out,
and is placed in the third position.]

365
00:21:03,755 --> 00:21:07,694
Just go on to the third position.
Gary's suffering because of you.

366
00:21:07,695 --> 00:21:10,224
We could all be resting
and getting a massage right now

367
00:21:10,225 --> 00:21:12,887
but we're all running around like this
because of you right now.

368
00:21:12,887 --> 00:21:15,018
We're all someone's precious
kids at home!

369
00:21:15,019 --> 00:21:18,260
Look at how we're all suffering!
All this is happening because of you!

370
00:21:18,261 --> 00:21:19,674
Let's do better from now on.

371
00:21:20,994 --> 00:21:24,070
You almost got really angry, huh?
We can just do better from now on.

372
00:21:24,071 --> 00:21:26,725
- We'll just do better from now on.
- You could've said that from the beginning.

373
00:21:26,726 --> 00:21:29,296
- It's just that we're all suffering.
- That's a nicer way of putting it.

374
00:21:29,297 --> 00:21:31,158
This is what I meant to say.

375
00:21:32,179 --> 00:21:35,088
- Do a good job, Suk Jin. Okay?
- I'm much better than Jong Kook is.

376
00:21:35,588 --> 00:21:38,023
- I'll be better than him.
- Please!

377
00:21:38,554 --> 00:21:41,104
Get your heads on straight!

378
00:21:41,105 --> 00:21:43,323
They told us that we'll be doing this until
we succeed no matter how long it takes.

379
00:21:43,324 --> 00:21:44,839
[The mission will continue
until they succeed.]

380
00:21:44,839 --> 00:21:48,531
- Team! Fighting!
- Fighting!

381
00:21:50,764 --> 00:21:52,577
[Play ball!]

382
00:21:52,578 --> 00:21:54,577
Pil-Chok-Cross!

383
00:21:58,431 --> 00:22:00,177
[Again!]

384
00:22:02,494 --> 00:22:05,747
- Can't you do it right!
- What are you doing?

385
00:22:14,819 --> 00:22:17,495
[Even though the players have changed,
the outcome is still the same.]

386
00:22:19,479 --> 00:22:21,195
- You got it!
- Get it!

387
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:26,317
Let's just get it once.

388
00:22:27,864 --> 00:22:30,857
Kwang Soo keeps avoiding the ball
so he doesn't get hit.

389
00:22:30,858 --> 00:22:33,204
[Oh?]

390
00:22:34,204 --> 00:22:36,907
[They finally catch the ball,
and onto the third catcher!]

391
00:22:43,061 --> 00:22:45,167
[There he goes again...]

392
00:22:45,168 --> 00:22:48,077
- Seriously!
- He's like our black hole!

393
00:22:49,262 --> 00:22:50,585
Seriously!

394
00:22:52,499 --> 00:22:53,771
- You come over here.
- Seriously.

395
00:22:53,772 --> 00:22:55,201
[Time to scold Kwang Soo?]

396
00:22:56,927 --> 00:22:58,707
- Lee Kwang Soo!
- What are you doing?

397
00:22:58,708 --> 00:23:00,614
Do you want to succeed or not?

398
00:23:00,615 --> 00:23:02,566
- Are you even sane right now?
- I'm going to get it right from now on.

399
00:23:02,567 --> 00:23:05,475
Is this your idea of teamwork?
Go tell Jong Kook right now.

400
00:23:05,476 --> 00:23:06,879
Tell him exactly what I just said to you.

401
00:23:07,644 --> 00:23:10,743
I got the message
loud and clear right now.

402
00:23:10,744 --> 00:23:13,343
[Running Man baseball team is on the ball
when it comes to chastising others.]

403
00:23:13,344 --> 00:23:15,161
- Jae Suk just told me...
- I just scolded him.

404
00:23:15,676 --> 00:23:19,630
[Baseball team's youngest player getting
scolded by everyone in turn.]

405
00:23:19,631 --> 00:23:21,763
- What are you doing?
- I've finally come to my senses.

406
00:23:21,764 --> 00:23:24,355
- What are you trying to do here?
- I know what I have to do now.

407
00:23:24,969 --> 00:23:27,119
Isn't Jong Kook the one who
made the mistake this time?

408
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,147
[No kidding.]

409
00:23:29,148 --> 00:23:31,935
- Why are you scolding Kwang Soo?
- Jong Kook is the one who made the mistake.

410
00:23:31,936 --> 00:23:33,709
- You tell him yourself!
- Relay my message to him.

411
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:35,899
- I told you what to say to him.
- You should've caught the ball.

412
00:23:36,609 --> 00:23:39,845
The way I see it though,
you guys didn't throw the ball right.

413
00:23:39,846 --> 00:23:41,747
- Listen to this guy.
- I'll do better.

414
00:23:43,563 --> 00:23:45,561
I'm lonely over here!

415
00:23:46,019 --> 00:23:48,593
- You're working really hard, Gary.
- I'm lonely.

416
00:23:48,594 --> 00:23:51,979
- Let's do it right this time.
- Let's do it right this time.

417
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:56,634
Let me say this as the captain of the team,
but this is really unacceptable.

418
00:23:56,635 --> 00:23:58,204
- Who made you captain?
- Why are you the captain?

419
00:23:58,205 --> 00:23:59,905
- Who made you captain?
- Why are you the captain?

420
00:23:59,906 --> 00:24:01,787
- Who made you?
- Who made you captain?

421
00:24:01,788 --> 00:24:04,003
- I'm the captain!
- Listen to that Grasshopper.

422
00:24:04,004 --> 00:24:05,990
Everyone get on the ground right now!

423
00:24:09,041 --> 00:24:10,954
[Another attempt]

424
00:24:12,555 --> 00:24:14,919
[Huh?]

425
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:19,552
[Gae-minator being lifted up into the air.]

426
00:24:23,466 --> 00:24:27,142
I've become one with the machine.
The forklift and I are now one.

427
00:24:28,404 --> 00:24:30,557
Even the color of your shirt
is the same as the forklift.

428
00:24:32,089 --> 00:24:35,498
[Play ball!]

429
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:39,463
Nice!
Throw it!

430
00:24:39,464 --> 00:24:40,842
[Yoo Hyuk's getting good at
catching now.]

431
00:24:42,239 --> 00:24:43,387
[Oh?]

432
00:24:43,422 --> 00:24:45,289
[The problem is the Iron Tiger,
the third catcher.]

433
00:24:51,532 --> 00:24:52,928
[Misses again.]

434
00:24:52,929 --> 00:24:55,251
- You need to throw it better!
- It was a good throw!

435
00:24:56,336 --> 00:24:57,951
- Come on, Gary.
- Here I go!

436
00:24:57,952 --> 00:24:59,240
You have to throw it now.

437
00:25:01,107 --> 00:25:02,739
[Huh?]

438
00:25:04,042 --> 00:25:05,789
[First catcher drops the ball.]

439
00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:07,765
- Jae Suk!
- Yoo Jae Suk!

440
00:25:07,766 --> 00:25:09,666
[But they still have plenty of time
left on the clock.]

441
00:25:13,371 --> 00:25:15,750
[Second catchers, Easy Brothers are
now doing good at catching the ball.]

442
00:25:15,751 --> 00:25:17,608
- There you go!
- Nice!

443
00:25:18,909 --> 00:25:19,981
[Time to throw it to Blank Ji.]

444
00:25:22,219 --> 00:25:24,381
[As predicted, nice catch!]

445
00:25:24,382 --> 00:25:25,952
Concentrate!

446
00:25:25,953 --> 00:25:27,166
Concentrate!

447
00:25:27,167 --> 00:25:29,135
[Time to hit a fly ball...]

448
00:25:29,136 --> 00:25:30,346
Concentrate!

449
00:25:30,347 --> 00:25:34,312
[Hitter, Ha Ha...]

450
00:25:34,313 --> 00:25:37,168
[He hits the ball!]

451
00:25:37,169 --> 00:25:39,245
[Oh... Yoo Hyuk catches the ball!]

452
00:25:40,432 --> 00:25:43,918
[Time for the last step!]

453
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:51,450
[Gary just needs to catch the ball from
his chair on the forklift!]

454
00:26:02,827 --> 00:26:06,078
[Why did he throw the ball to her?]

455
00:26:07,202 --> 00:26:09,203
What?
Why did you do that?

456
00:26:09,204 --> 00:26:12,118
- What are you doing?
- What were you thinking!

457
00:26:12,119 --> 00:26:13,800
Why didn't you throw it to me?

458
00:26:15,565 --> 00:26:17,840
Get your head on straight!

459
00:26:17,841 --> 00:26:19,527
[The teammates take turns scolding him.]

460
00:26:19,528 --> 00:26:21,413
Your skills aren't the problem,
but it's your lack of memory.

461
00:26:21,414 --> 00:26:23,239
[Finally got caught doing something wrong?
Iron Tiger doesn't hesitate to scold him.]

462
00:26:23,852 --> 00:26:27,364
- You have awful memory skills.
- Let's just get him for this.

463
00:26:27,365 --> 00:26:29,516
I think it's time for you to
get on the chair.

464
00:26:29,517 --> 00:26:32,110
[Time for Yoo Hyuk to get on
the spinning chair?]

465
00:26:33,182 --> 00:26:35,890
Getting dizzy is one thing,
but I'm too lonely up here.

466
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:38,270
Fighting!

467
00:26:38,271 --> 00:26:42,020
- Let's succeed this time!
- Let's do this until we succeed!

468
00:26:42,021 --> 00:26:43,847
- Fighting!
- Fighting!

469
00:26:51,902 --> 00:26:53,462
- This is no joke.
- You're too low.

470
00:26:55,534 --> 00:26:57,244
Spin him faster!

471
00:27:04,048 --> 00:27:05,258
Nice!

472
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:08,980
- Okay, I got it now.
- Throw it higher.

473
00:27:08,981 --> 00:27:10,859
Do better!

474
00:27:15,398 --> 00:27:16,769
We got it.

475
00:27:23,658 --> 00:27:24,788
- There you go!
- You got it!

476
00:27:24,789 --> 00:27:26,680
[All the way to Blank Ji
in the blink of an eye.]

477
00:27:28,055 --> 00:27:29,543
[Ten seconds left on the clock.]

478
00:27:35,772 --> 00:27:38,496
[Fails with Big-nosed Brother.]

479
00:27:40,009 --> 00:27:41,275
Suk Jin!

480
00:27:41,276 --> 00:27:43,275
- You want to get up there?
- Come up here!

481
00:27:43,276 --> 00:27:44,815
- Suk Jin!
- I'm sorry.

482
00:27:44,816 --> 00:27:48,346
[In the end...]

483
00:27:48,347 --> 00:27:52,269
[Another position change?]

484
00:27:57,109 --> 00:27:59,114
- You have to stay focused!
- I'm so dizzy.

485
00:27:59,115 --> 00:28:01,142
- Stay focused!
- Play ball!

486
00:28:01,616 --> 00:28:02,829
Suk Jin!

487
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:04,130
Fighting!

488
00:28:07,410 --> 00:28:08,742
Throw it!

489
00:28:09,122 --> 00:28:12,420
[He's just spinning around...]

490
00:28:13,968 --> 00:28:15,233
Throw it now!

491
00:28:17,472 --> 00:28:19,552
[An aimless throw to no one.]

492
00:28:22,102 --> 00:28:25,149
You can't come down from there
until we succeed.

493
00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:32,508
What are you doing?

494
00:28:32,509 --> 00:28:34,737
- You have to focus!
- I'm so dizzy.

495
00:28:39,707 --> 00:28:41,491
- I'm seriously so dizzy.
- What are you doing?

496
00:28:41,685 --> 00:28:43,301
Okay.

497
00:28:43,781 --> 00:28:44,832
Right now.

498
00:28:46,223 --> 00:28:47,932
[Finally.]

499
00:28:52,258 --> 00:28:54,183
[Second catcher duo does a good job
of catching the ball.]

500
00:28:56,925 --> 00:28:58,859
[Even the Iron Tiger catches the ball
without a glitch.]

501
00:29:03,206 --> 00:29:05,192
[And Blank Ji, who has never
failed at catching the ball.]

502
00:29:05,193 --> 00:29:06,390
Here I go.

503
00:29:08,047 --> 00:29:09,234
I'm so dizzy.

504
00:29:09,235 --> 00:29:10,412
Here I go.

505
00:29:12,829 --> 00:29:14,527
[He catches the ball!]

506
00:29:15,223 --> 00:29:17,779
[Finally throwing the ball
to the first catcher, Gary!]

507
00:29:19,033 --> 00:29:20,244
Look over here!

508
00:29:26,426 --> 00:29:28,430
[Where am I?]

509
00:29:29,952 --> 00:29:31,812
[Utter chaos.]

510
00:29:31,813 --> 00:29:33,972
- Look over here, Suk Jin!
- Focus!

511
00:29:33,973 --> 00:29:35,802
Open your eyes!

512
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:41,248
[Whatever!]

513
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:44,592
[So dizzy...]

514
00:29:45,509 --> 00:29:49,297
[If he can only catch the ball...]

515
00:29:54,592 --> 00:29:56,604
[No strength or motivation...]

516
00:29:56,605 --> 00:29:58,900
You have to concentrate!

517
00:30:02,649 --> 00:30:04,772
I'm sorry, but I'm way too dizzy.

518
00:30:05,468 --> 00:30:08,765
[They're going to waste the whole day...
Running Man baseball team losing hope.]

519
00:30:09,957 --> 00:30:12,790
[I'm so dizzy...]

520
00:30:13,883 --> 00:30:16,425
[Continuing on with the mission...]

521
00:30:17,851 --> 00:30:20,521
[Heading that you don't see on the
baseball field too often.]

522
00:30:21,872 --> 00:30:23,954
Do I look like some
video game machine to you?

523
00:30:26,099 --> 00:30:28,217
[Nonstop mistakes.]

524
00:30:33,231 --> 00:30:35,877
[The elusive success.]

525
00:30:35,878 --> 00:30:40,471
We have lighting prepared for when it
gets dark, so no need for you to worry.

526
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:44,269
- What are you saying right now?
- You think we're worried about lighting?

527
00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:45,820
Why would you say that
to us right now?

528
00:30:45,821 --> 00:30:49,162
It's all over for us!
We're never going to get to go home!

529
00:30:49,702 --> 00:30:53,610
Let's go home!
Fighting!

530
00:30:55,498 --> 00:30:57,986
[Meanwhile...]

531
00:30:57,987 --> 00:31:01,616
[Korean Monster,
Ryu Hyun Jin arrives back in Korea.]

532
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:06,964
[The one who rules Running Man with
a happy smile on his face.]

533
00:31:07,515 --> 00:31:10,035
This is your 14th attempt.

534
00:31:10,036 --> 00:31:11,340
- Kwang Soo.
- Yes, Jae Suk?

535
00:31:16,794 --> 00:31:19,192
What do you mean, you're going to
beat me if I make another mistake?

536
00:31:19,443 --> 00:31:22,079
I'm doing the best that
I can right now.

537
00:31:22,572 --> 00:31:24,266
What do you mean, get lost?

538
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:29,801
- Let's get it done this time.
- Let's really get it done this time!

539
00:31:29,802 --> 00:31:31,374
Let's do this!

540
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:39,645
[The Easy Brothers know just
what to do now.]

541
00:31:41,803 --> 00:31:44,532
[Even the Iron Tiger gets it right.]

542
00:31:46,045 --> 00:31:48,554
[And Blank Ji always gets it right.]

543
00:31:49,749 --> 00:31:51,999
[All the way to the hitter
in a blink of an eye.]

544
00:31:54,826 --> 00:31:57,769
[Now time to throw it to the first pitcher.]

545
00:31:59,468 --> 00:32:02,436
[Time for the final step.]

546
00:32:02,437 --> 00:32:03,934
Just this once!

547
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,550
Now!

548
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:09,454
[Catch it!]

549
00:32:10,618 --> 00:32:13,422
[Will this be it?]

550
00:32:13,423 --> 00:32:16,882
[Will they succeed the mission?]

551
00:32:22,717 --> 00:32:25,069
[So close... but fail.]

552
00:32:25,832 --> 00:32:27,962
[There's still time!]

553
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:31,259
It's okay, we've still got time.

554
00:32:33,766 --> 00:32:36,201
[Running Man baseball team has all
the moves down by now.]

555
00:32:37,299 --> 00:32:39,562
[Even the black hole Tiger
knows what to do.]

556
00:32:42,150 --> 00:32:44,174
[Blank Ji is a master at catching by now.]

557
00:32:47,955 --> 00:32:50,201
[Back to Yoo Hyuk.]

558
00:32:51,332 --> 00:32:52,470
This is it!

559
00:32:52,471 --> 00:32:53,960
[This time!]

560
00:32:55,262 --> 00:32:57,926
[Must time it right for
spinning Gary to catch it.]

561
00:33:00,387 --> 00:33:04,384
[This time?]

562
00:33:07,092 --> 00:33:09,289
[Will they do it?]

563
00:33:12,288 --> 00:33:15,307
[He catches the ball!]

564
00:33:15,308 --> 00:33:17,200
[Success]

565
00:33:19,223 --> 00:33:22,895
[Running Man baseball team
succeeds in their 14th attempt.]

566
00:33:27,643 --> 00:33:29,517
We can do it!

567
00:33:32,012 --> 00:33:33,547
You did great, Gary.

568
00:33:39,213 --> 00:33:44,898
[Thank you to Gary and the operator of
the forklift for all their hard work.]

569
00:33:44,899 --> 00:33:46,148
Thank you!

570
00:33:46,837 --> 00:33:49,114
[Time to check the next question.]

571
00:33:49,115 --> 00:33:50,551
I'll pick the right one this time.

572
00:33:52,812 --> 00:33:54,463
Look at him.

573
00:33:57,262 --> 00:34:01,563
This is our L.A. baseball stadium
where we have our games.

574
00:34:03,164 --> 00:34:10,507
[Ryu Hyun Jin's home stadium where he
racked up his impressive first season record.]

575
00:34:14,623 --> 00:34:20,441
There are over 50 thousand fans that
come to the games to cheer us on.

576
00:34:21,096 --> 00:34:25,026
It's such a fun and great place to be.

577
00:34:25,027 --> 00:34:26,895
[The love and the cheer from the fans
gives him the energy to play on!]

578
00:34:26,895 --> 00:34:31,431
This is the dugout where all the players
sit and wait for their turns.

579
00:34:31,432 --> 00:34:34,513
- You see the dugout on TV during the games.
- That's where the coaches keep watch.

580
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:37,076
- He's called me from there a few times.
- Why would he call you?

581
00:34:37,077 --> 00:34:40,908
- This is a phone you can use to call out.
- See? That's what he used to call me.

582
00:34:40,909 --> 00:34:46,822
This is the phone you use to call out
to swap out the players.

583
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:53,664
This is the spot... where our team coach
always stands to watch the game.

584
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:56,342
And as for me...

585
00:34:58,207 --> 00:35:00,419
This is where I sit during the games.

586
00:35:01,351 --> 00:35:04,143
To the left of me is where Uribe
always sits.

587
00:35:04,144 --> 00:35:10,609
This is exactly the spot where that
infamous incident occurred.

588
00:35:12,785 --> 00:35:19,093
[This is the spot where the stern expression
was caught which started the news sensation.]

589
00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:22,317
[What exactly happened then?]

590
00:35:22,318 --> 00:35:27,463
I just went inside for a brief moment and
came back out during one of the games.

591
00:35:27,464 --> 00:35:31,975
So Uribe asked me if I went inside
to take a little nap.

592
00:35:31,976 --> 00:35:35,288
So I told him to stop kidding around and
playfully smacked him on the face...

593
00:35:35,289 --> 00:35:36,938
and that was caught on camera.

594
00:35:36,939 --> 00:35:40,009
I think this is how I was standing.

595
00:35:40,010 --> 00:35:43,066
- I just hit him like that lightly.
- I wish I could hit him too.

596
00:35:43,584 --> 00:35:47,172
- You want to hit Uribe in the face?
- Close enough friends where I can do that.

597
00:35:47,676 --> 00:35:50,449
Why don't you start by hitting Jong Kook first
before you move on to hitting Uribe?

598
00:35:51,042 --> 00:35:52,866
This is where I sit.

599
00:35:52,867 --> 00:35:56,275
[This is the spot where Hyun Jin sits
when he's not in the game.]

600
00:35:56,276 --> 00:35:58,341
So that's where he sits.

601
00:35:58,342 --> 00:36:01,395
This is where I keep my towel.

602
00:36:01,396 --> 00:36:04,952
And this is where I keep all my bats.

603
00:36:05,472 --> 00:36:07,165
And this is how I go onto the field.

604
00:36:07,166 --> 00:36:10,075
[Going onto the field with all that
energy when it's his turn.]

605
00:36:13,278 --> 00:36:15,737
Where are we going right now?

606
00:36:15,738 --> 00:36:17,619
[What is this place?]

607
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:22,540
This is where the players can warm up
before each game.

608
00:36:22,903 --> 00:36:28,523
And the players who are on deck can use this
space to warm up before they go out.

609
00:36:30,627 --> 00:36:31,894
Isn't it nice?

610
00:36:34,764 --> 00:36:36,550
[Is he going to show us his pitch?]

611
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:40,034
Strike.

612
00:36:41,625 --> 00:36:44,450
[Martin Kin, an employee who
acts as an interpreter for the Dodgers.]

613
00:36:51,901 --> 00:36:53,417
Ball.

614
00:36:57,487 --> 00:36:59,321
The fatso is so cute.
He's so cute even when he gets angry.

615
00:37:01,665 --> 00:37:03,384
[But...]

616
00:37:03,385 --> 00:37:05,750
[Why is he getting in
position to spin around?]

617
00:37:07,112 --> 00:37:10,050
[What's he doing?]

618
00:37:16,736 --> 00:37:19,921
[Spinning around with all his might.]

619
00:37:25,453 --> 00:37:27,294
I'm getting really dizzy.

620
00:37:38,815 --> 00:37:40,677
[Ten spins.]

621
00:37:40,678 --> 00:37:43,319
[And pitching the ball?]

622
00:37:50,737 --> 00:37:51,926
Ball!

623
00:37:52,745 --> 00:37:54,235
Wow, I'm seriously so dizzy.

624
00:37:55,775 --> 00:37:58,717
[Reduce it to only five spins?]

625
00:37:58,718 --> 00:38:00,983
If you reduce it down to five spins,
I can pitch a strike.

626
00:38:00,984 --> 00:38:03,632
- You can do it.
- Fighting.

627
00:38:05,914 --> 00:38:08,673
[Only five spins this time.]

628
00:38:08,674 --> 00:38:09,792
Set, go.

629
00:38:10,887 --> 00:38:13,939
[Will he do it?]

630
00:38:15,376 --> 00:38:18,639
Three.
Four.

631
00:38:19,695 --> 00:38:20,925
Five.

632
00:38:27,439 --> 00:38:29,428
[Oh?]

633
00:38:29,429 --> 00:38:30,692
Strike!

634
00:38:30,693 --> 00:38:32,249
Strike!

635
00:38:35,194 --> 00:38:37,389
Ryu Hyun Jin's challenge!

636
00:38:37,390 --> 00:38:40,781
[Choose- Ryu Hyun Jin can pitch a strike
after spinning around seven times.]

637
00:38:41,372 --> 00:38:43,777
[A- Strike]
[B- Ball]

638
00:38:43,778 --> 00:38:45,380
- No, he can't.
- He can't do it.

639
00:38:45,381 --> 00:38:48,258
[Another hot debate.]

640
00:38:48,259 --> 00:38:50,329
He just got a strike after five spins.

641
00:38:50,330 --> 00:38:52,990
- Strike.
- He'll get a strike.

642
00:38:52,991 --> 00:38:54,455
- Who thinks he'll get a ball?
- Ball.

643
00:38:54,456 --> 00:38:56,081
- It's a ball.
- He'll get a strike.

644
00:38:57,151 --> 00:38:58,946
- I'm telling you that it'll be a strike.
- It'll be a ball.

645
00:38:58,947 --> 00:39:01,715
- Let's go with a ball.
- I'm telling you, it's a strike.

646
00:39:01,716 --> 00:39:04,393
- It'll be a strike!
- Hyun Jin can do it.

647
00:39:04,394 --> 00:39:06,962
A person's body works like this.

648
00:39:07,247 --> 00:39:10,838
- He won't be able to do it.
- Why does he make all the decisions?

649
00:39:10,839 --> 00:39:12,441
- Then let's do this.
- Play rock-paper-scissors.

650
00:39:12,442 --> 00:39:15,866
Let's play rock-paper-scissors and
go with what the winner chooses.

651
00:39:16,147 --> 00:39:19,339
[Strike- Three people vs. Ball- Three people.]

652
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:21,009
Rock-paper-scissors.
Okay!

653
00:39:21,010 --> 00:39:23,170
Rock-paper-scissors.
Paper. Okay!

654
00:39:23,171 --> 00:39:25,271
[Giraffe wins three times in a row.]

655
00:39:26,002 --> 00:39:28,005
[Gary wins.]

656
00:39:30,021 --> 00:39:32,877
[It all comes down to Rock-paper-scissors
between Gary and Jong Kook.]

657
00:39:32,878 --> 00:39:34,825
Rock-paper-scissors.

658

[B- Ball team wins.]

659
00:39:39,152 --> 00:39:41,639
I'm telling you that
he's going to get a strike!

660
00:39:42,333 --> 00:39:45,338
[Deciding to go with option B, Ball, after
a round of rock-paper-scissors.]

661
00:39:45,339 --> 00:39:48,830
- On the count of three...
- It's going to be a strike!

662
00:39:48,831 --> 00:39:51,073
One, two, three.
Ball!

663
00:39:51,074 --> 00:39:53,865
- I know it's going to be a strike.
- Ball!

664
00:39:55,445 --> 00:39:58,617
- This is seriously so frustrating.
- We're going to succeed this time.

665
00:39:58,618 --> 00:40:01,761
<i>[Ryu Hyun Jin can't throw a strike.]</i>

666
00:40:01,762 --> 00:40:05,431
<i>[If you chose that he can't throw a strike,
then go to 'S' hanwoo barbeque place.]</i>

667
00:40:06,624 --> 00:40:09,061
[Oh... hanwoo beef barbeque place?]

668
00:40:09,062 --> 00:40:12,271
- Hanwoo beef barbeque place.
- Let's go!

669
00:40:14,485 --> 00:40:16,645
I doubt they'll let us eat that for free.

670
00:40:22,536 --> 00:40:25,236
['S' restaurant in Boo-yeo.]

671
00:40:25,237 --> 00:40:28,104
- It's a strike.
- No, it'll be a ball.

672
00:40:28,105 --> 00:40:30,570
[Strike vs. Ball.
Still hotly debating one another.]

673
00:40:30,571 --> 00:40:31,915
Let's check first.

674
00:40:32,570 --> 00:40:34,582
[Time to check the answer.]

675
00:40:35,972 --> 00:40:37,303
Okay, press it.

676
00:40:37,304 --> 00:40:40,771
[Did they make the right
selection this time?]

677
00:40:43,015 --> 00:40:46,045
Ryu Hyun Jin's challenge!
Okay, watch.

678
00:40:47,281 --> 00:40:49,253
- Seven spins, right?
- I'm telling you that he'll do it.

679
00:40:49,254 --> 00:40:50,977
[Ryun Hyun Jin can or cannot pitch a strike
after spinning around seven times.]

680
00:40:50,978 --> 00:40:55,547
[They chose that he can't.]

681
00:40:55,548 --> 00:40:57,575
I'm telling you that I'm dizzy
just from watching him do it.

682
00:40:57,576 --> 00:41:00,469
[Will he do it?]

683
00:41:01,881 --> 00:41:04,507
- See? He's stumbling.
- I know he can do it.

684
00:41:04,508 --> 00:41:07,963
- He's stumbling.
- No, he's just finding his position.

685
00:41:07,964 --> 00:41:10,569
- No, he can't do it.
- I'm telling you that he can!

686
00:41:10,570 --> 00:41:12,701
- He's Ryu Hyun Jin!
- He just stumbled.

687
00:41:19,784 --> 00:41:22,369
[Huh?]

688
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:25,120
[Ball- Running Man gets it right!]

689
00:41:35,876 --> 00:41:37,970
This is what it's like.

690
00:41:38,905 --> 00:41:41,095
[If there had been a hitter,
then the ball would've hit his face?]

691
00:41:42,269 --> 00:41:44,853
You've got the right place.
You've come to the right place.

692
00:41:44,854 --> 00:41:46,365
He told us we came to the right place.

693
00:41:46,366 --> 00:41:49,766
- The person who got it right gets this ball.
- He's giving us his ball?

694
00:41:49,767 --> 00:41:51,120
[A signed ball as a gift?]

695
00:41:53,932 --> 00:41:56,497
So this is how you shoot that?
I've always been very curious about it.

696
00:41:57,490 --> 00:42:01,024
[An immediate space travel?
Hyun Jin's signed ball from L.A.]

697
00:42:01,815 --> 00:42:05,090
<i>You'll receive a signed ball every time
you choose the correct answer.</i>

698
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:08,270
<i>How that ball will get utilized
will become a very important factor.</i>

699
00:42:08,271 --> 00:42:12,262
<i>So you need to decide who's going to
keep the ball in safekeeping.</i>

700
00:42:12,263 --> 00:42:14,290
[Deciding for himself as to
who's going to hang onto the ball.]

701
00:42:14,291 --> 00:42:17,185
It's not a bad decision to let
Suk Jin keep the ball.

702
00:42:17,186 --> 00:42:18,686
- Yeah, it'll be easy to take it from him.
- That's right.

703
00:42:18,687 --> 00:42:20,455
We can steal the ball later, right?

704
00:42:20,456 --> 00:42:22,156
- Just give it to Suk Jin for now.
- Thanks.

705
00:42:22,552 --> 00:42:24,487
Then we get the easy mission?

706
00:42:24,488 --> 00:42:28,096
- It's an extremely easy mission.
- We're going to get to eat!

707
00:42:29,768 --> 00:42:35,126
- If you had chosen the wrong answer...
- What is it?

708
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:37,379
<i>You would've had to spin around
in the rice paddy</i>

709
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:41,474
<i>and find ten baseballs that are hidden
in the muddy fields.</i>

710
00:42:41,475 --> 00:42:43,128
See?
Aren't you glad you listened?

711
00:42:47,338 --> 00:42:49,360
[Aren't you disappointed?]

712
00:42:52,292 --> 00:42:54,377
I don't think we should have
too much faith in Ryu Hyun Jin.

713
00:42:54,802 --> 00:42:57,365
- That's why you need to listen to us.
- Attention.

714
00:42:57,366 --> 00:42:58,658
No thanks.

715
00:42:58,659 --> 00:43:01,819
- I'm sorry, but what I said was wrong.
- You sure?

716
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:05,328
Wow... that would've been a nightmare.
We really made the right decision.

717
00:43:05,329 --> 00:43:07,177
[The right and wrong answers-
A world of difference.]

718
00:43:07,178 --> 00:43:09,113
- What's our mission?
- So your mission is...

719
00:43:09,887 --> 00:43:13,896
<i>You have to build a tower with all the
meat pieces that are on the grill pan.</i>

720
00:43:13,897 --> 00:43:15,488
- What?
- Build a meat tower?

721
00:43:15,489 --> 00:43:17,555
[Build a tower with
the meat on the grill pan.]

722
00:43:18,361 --> 00:43:20,461
[Like this.]

723
00:43:21,290 --> 00:43:22,759
- That's doable.
- We can do that.

724
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:25,788
<i>If the tower topples over...</i>

725
00:43:25,789 --> 00:43:28,204
<i>we, the staff will enjoy the
fallen meat.</i>

726
00:43:28,205 --> 00:43:29,965
[We, the staff will enjoy the fallen meat.]

727
00:43:30,670 --> 00:43:35,382
[The beautifully delicious hanwoo beef.]

728
00:43:35,454 --> 00:43:38,184
[Dear God... please help us.]

729
00:43:40,454 --> 00:43:43,753
Since the meat can't be cooked once it's
built in a tower, cook it before you do it.

730
00:43:43,754 --> 00:43:47,521
But since it's the staff eating it if we fail,
let's not cook it as thoroughly.

731
00:43:47,521 --> 00:43:48,802
- Why?
- Huh?

732
00:43:48,803 --> 00:43:51,691
- Or we can burn it.
- Let's not cook it perfectly.

733
00:43:51,692 --> 00:43:56,317
- It's better if it's undercooked though.
- You have to cook it so the meat stays firm.

734
00:43:56,687 --> 00:44:00,003
If you cook it too long,
then it becomes too firm to work with.

735
00:44:00,004 --> 00:44:03,504
[Coach Kook never stops with his banter
even in front of the grill pan.]

736
00:44:03,505 --> 00:44:06,182
Why are you so full of nagging
over grilling meat?

737
00:44:07,264 --> 00:44:10,032
[Wow...]

738
00:44:10,033 --> 00:44:12,783
- This looks so good.
- You have to keep the juices in there.

739
00:44:12,784 --> 00:44:18,092
- So that as you press down on it...
- It'll be easier to stack it up then.

740
00:44:18,093 --> 00:44:20,601
- Leave it alone.
- Stop flipping it over.

741
00:44:20,602 --> 00:44:23,794
- Stop flipping the meat!
- Don't you even know how to grill meat?

742
00:44:23,795 --> 00:44:25,468
I like my meat really well done.

743
00:44:25,469 --> 00:44:29,156
- Just leave it and you can do that later.
- I like my meat really well done.

744
00:44:29,157 --> 00:44:31,465
[All the fighting over personal preference
on how they like their meat grilled.]

745
00:44:31,466 --> 00:44:33,993
- This one, this one.
- No, it's my choice!

746
00:44:33,994 --> 00:44:36,149
- No, it's this one!
- Be quiet!

747
00:44:37,513 --> 00:44:42,386
[Everyone has an opinion of their own.]

748
00:44:45,908 --> 00:44:50,001
[Ah...]

749
00:44:50,002 --> 00:44:54,964
[I want to escape from all this chaos...]

750
00:44:54,965 --> 00:44:57,124
This is why I don't go on
family vacations.

751
00:44:57,553 --> 00:45:00,299
[Especially these two loud mouths.]

752
00:45:01,256 --> 00:45:03,379
- Okay, I'm laying down the first piece.
- That's the one. Look at that.

753
00:45:03,380 --> 00:45:05,455
[Ha Ha lays down the first meat block.]

754
00:45:07,565 --> 00:45:09,511
- No, that's not the one.
- Lay this one down next.

755
00:45:09,512 --> 00:45:12,659
[Blank Ji carefully lays down the next block.]

756
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:15,029
- We're going to succeed.
- Right in the middle.

757
00:45:15,030 --> 00:45:17,760
There's no way for us to fail this one.

758
00:45:18,527 --> 00:45:20,315
You have to lay it down carefully
so that it's stable.

759
00:45:20,316 --> 00:45:21,836
- Hurry up.
- Stop cooking it.

760
00:45:23,259 --> 00:45:25,462
We're going to be able to eat this
after we're done with this mission.

761
00:45:25,463 --> 00:45:27,733
- Just lay it down for now.
- Okay!

762
00:45:27,734 --> 00:45:30,466
- Look at it from above.
- Okay, I got this.

763
00:45:30,467 --> 00:45:32,616
- It's over once you lay it down.
- Look at it from the top.

764
00:45:34,220 --> 00:45:36,303
[Stable tower with their current four pieces.]

765
00:45:36,304 --> 00:45:39,475
[Next is Kkuk with his rare preference.]

766
00:45:41,019 --> 00:45:43,267
- It's leaning a bit to the side.
- No, it's okay.

767
00:45:43,268 --> 00:45:45,285
I think it's leaning bit.

768
00:45:45,286 --> 00:45:46,521
Look at it from the top.

769
00:45:46,522 --> 00:45:49,305
[Carefully approaching in
a mermaid position.]

770
00:45:55,541 --> 00:45:57,186
See?
It's leaning!

771
00:45:57,187 --> 00:45:59,976
- See? It's leaning!
- No, it's perfect.

772
00:45:59,977 --> 00:46:02,659
[Slightly less stable looking meat tower.]

773
00:46:03,043 --> 00:46:04,504
- Okay, Kwang Soo.
- Kwang Soo.

774
00:46:04,505 --> 00:46:07,302
[Kwang Soo taking his turn in sixth position
which has become quite crucial.]

775
00:46:09,430 --> 00:46:12,159
[If he succeeds, there will only be
two more pieces left to go.]

776
00:46:13,598 --> 00:46:17,391
[Please]

777
00:46:18,653 --> 00:46:20,567
[Kwang Soo succeeds with his
sixth piece of meat.]

778
00:46:20,568 --> 00:46:22,821
- You have to look from the top.
- This way more, Gary.

779
00:46:22,822 --> 00:46:24,987
[It's time for hanwoo grilling party
as soon as Gary gets in his piece.]

780
00:46:25,541 --> 00:46:27,675
Hurry!
You have to hurry, Gary!

781
00:46:28,190 --> 00:46:30,315
[Hurry!]

782
00:46:33,610 --> 00:46:36,262
[Hanwoo tower is in danger of destruction!]

783
00:46:38,102 --> 00:46:44,595
[Will they be able to save it?]

784
00:46:47,723 --> 00:46:55,736
[No! My meat!]

785
00:46:59,326 --> 00:47:02,349
[Since they failed the mission,
the PD will confiscate the meat.]

786
00:47:03,790 --> 00:47:07,017
[Chopstick madness.]

787
00:47:13,431 --> 00:47:16,344
[In less than a blink of an eye,
all the meat gets stolen off the plate.]

788
00:47:16,489 --> 00:47:18,644
[A completely bare plate.]

789
00:47:18,645 --> 00:47:20,157
[You just wait...]

790
00:47:27,204 --> 00:47:28,357
It's really good.

791
00:47:28,358 --> 00:47:32,032
<i>You've angered the staff members, so
they're giving you a different cut of meat.</i>

792
00:47:35,270 --> 00:47:38,152
- Can I get some cola?
- Not until you succeed.

793
00:47:38,153 --> 00:47:40,570
It's going to be tougher than the last time.
These are shaped rounder.

794
00:47:40,571 --> 00:47:41,887
[Rounder shaped meat pieces.]

795
00:47:42,469 --> 00:47:44,086
Can we get a fresh grill pan?

796
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:48,030
[You think you're out to eat?]

797
00:47:48,031 --> 00:47:50,530
- Let's do it. Give me that.
- Let's change the pan.

798
00:47:50,531 --> 00:47:53,345
- Just give it to me, and let's cook it.
- No, let's change out the grill pan.

799
00:47:53,346 --> 00:47:56,849
- What's wrong with you?
- This isn't good for you.

800
00:47:56,850 --> 00:47:59,220
- No, it's fine!
- Change it. This isn't good for your health.

801
00:47:59,221 --> 00:48:01,456
- Lets swap it out.
- What are you doing?

802
00:48:01,457 --> 00:48:04,786
- No, you did the right thing.
- It takes two seconds to swap it out.

803
00:48:04,787 --> 00:48:06,736
I'm sorry, Sir.
It's for the sake of his health.

804
00:48:07,639 --> 00:48:11,156
[We're sorry for
making things difficult for you.]

805
00:48:11,157 --> 00:48:13,307
What's the need to exchange it now?

806
00:48:14,068 --> 00:48:16,318
- Okay, we got it now.
- This is much better.

807
00:48:16,319 --> 00:48:19,788
- Wait until the grill gets hot.
- Just get the meat on there.

808
00:48:19,789 --> 00:48:21,664
[Nonstop nagging about everything.]

809
00:48:21,665 --> 00:48:25,305
- This is the first one.
- It's really good though.

810
00:48:25,306 --> 00:48:29,539
- This is the second one?
- Let's do this quickly and eat. I'm hungry.

811
00:48:30,746 --> 00:48:33,426
I think this is the easiest mission
we've ever gotten before.

812
00:48:33,427 --> 00:48:36,311
[The meat is cooking nicely.]

813
00:48:37,599 --> 00:48:38,701
Okay!

814
00:48:38,702 --> 00:48:41,886
[Second attempt with the determination to
chow down on the meat when they're done.]

815
00:48:41,923 --> 00:48:44,540
- We have to succeed this time.
- I think that's a good piece.

816
00:48:44,541 --> 00:48:46,390
This one's good too.
Lay that one on top.

817
00:48:47,628 --> 00:48:49,222
Lay it over.

818
00:48:49,223 --> 00:48:52,698
- Get it right in the middle.
- I need better chopsticks.

819
00:48:55,275 --> 00:48:57,903
[Getting serious about their meat selection.]

820
00:48:57,904 --> 00:49:01,002
- That's a good piece.
- This should be good, right?

821
00:49:01,003 --> 00:49:04,773
- Why are you laying it crooked?
- No, this is a good piece.

822
00:49:04,774 --> 00:49:06,948
[Nonstop nagging.]

823
00:49:06,949 --> 00:49:10,129
- No, this needs to be the last piece.
- That's crooked.

824
00:49:11,517 --> 00:49:14,192
- No, do this piece.
- I think this will be better.

825
00:49:14,193 --> 00:49:16,730
- Are you sure about this one?
- Do this one first.

826
00:49:16,731 --> 00:49:19,010
It's exhausting for
all of us to go around together.

827
00:49:19,644 --> 00:49:22,582
[So uncomfortable...]

828
00:49:24,308 --> 00:49:27,292
[Jong Kook succeeds with his fifth piece.]

829
00:49:27,293 --> 00:49:29,666
[Second to last turn, Kwang Soo.]

830
00:49:29,667 --> 00:49:32,728
- You have to be very careful about it now.
- Let's please eat now.

831
00:49:32,729 --> 00:49:35,397
- Let's eat.
- Don't move the table, and don't touch it.

832
00:49:35,398 --> 00:49:38,665
- You have to be careful not to topple it.
- See? We should've done the other piece.

833
00:49:42,994 --> 00:49:45,726
- You have to be more cautious.
- Move it over a bit.

834
00:49:46,275 --> 00:49:49,177
[Six piece tower starting to
lose its balance.]

835
00:49:50,950 --> 00:49:52,745
How many seconds does it
need to stay for?

836
00:49:52,746 --> 00:49:55,002
[Must last for three seconds with all
seven pieces for it to count as a success.]

837
00:49:56,326 --> 00:49:58,534
[The chopsticks are off the meat!]

838
00:49:58,535 --> 00:50:02,313
[What will happen?]

839
00:50:04,466 --> 00:50:06,322
[Oh! Kwang Soo succeeds!]

840
00:50:06,323 --> 00:50:08,320
- You have to do it!
- get out of his way!

841
00:50:11,115 --> 00:50:13,056
- We'll hold onto you.
- Come on, Gary!

842
00:50:14,303 --> 00:50:15,440
Let's eat.

843
00:50:15,441 --> 00:50:17,502
We've got you, so don't worry.

844
00:50:17,503 --> 00:50:18,932
[Four people are holding Gary steady.]

845
00:50:18,933 --> 00:50:20,556
Just worry about your balance.

846
00:50:20,557 --> 00:50:23,078
[As long as he can do this,
then the mission is a success!]

847
00:50:23,079 --> 00:50:25,256
- You can do this!
- No!

848
00:50:27,225 --> 00:50:30,353
No, Gary!
That's not the spot!

849
00:50:30,354 --> 00:50:32,315
[Desperation]

850
00:50:32,316 --> 00:50:35,618
- No, that's not it!
- Come on!

851
00:50:35,882 --> 00:50:39,961
[The last step towards
a hanwoo grilling party!]

852
00:50:40,872 --> 00:50:45,004
[Gary... we're hungry...]

853
00:50:47,735 --> 00:50:49,735
[What will happen?]

854
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:01,575
[Angry PD rushes in to
cover the meat with a plate.]

855
00:51:02,024 --> 00:51:04,852
[Saves the meat from the attack
of all the chopsticks.]

856
00:51:08,036 --> 00:51:10,026
That was unbelievable.

857
00:51:12,230 --> 00:51:14,204
That was unbelievable.

858
00:51:14,205 --> 00:51:19,536
[The meat that he saved...
is for the staff members to enjoy.]

859
00:51:20,483 --> 00:51:23,320
[Meat tower's third attempt.]

860
00:51:24,025 --> 00:51:25,537
Bring it here.

861
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:29,132
[All the members are on edge after
having their meat taken away.]

862
00:51:29,133 --> 00:51:31,164
[Annoyed members.]

863
00:51:32,955 --> 00:51:35,242
It's not for us to eat right now.
Just put it down!

864
00:51:35,243 --> 00:51:37,541
- Let's set it down.
- Should we change the grill again?

865
00:51:37,542 --> 00:51:39,805
- No, we don't need to change it.
- Can I go first this time?

866
00:51:39,806 --> 00:51:41,631
- Stop touching it.
- Can I go first this time?

867
00:51:41,632 --> 00:51:45,471
Stop touching it and just leave it alone!

868
00:51:47,379 --> 00:51:48,616
Seriously.

869
00:51:48,617 --> 00:51:50,858
You're seriously stressing me out!

870
00:51:50,859 --> 00:51:52,553
[Everyone's starting to get stressed out.]

871
00:51:52,588 --> 00:51:53,672
Can I go first this time?

872
00:51:53,673 --> 00:51:56,313
- Who cares who grills it?
- Come this way then.

873
00:51:56,314 --> 00:51:58,494
- Let me go first.
- What are you talking about?

874
00:51:58,495 --> 00:52:00,190
I don't think I can do this.

875
00:52:00,191 --> 00:52:03,063
[Gary's cracking under the pressure
of being the last member to go.]

876
00:52:03,064 --> 00:52:04,854
Okay, then we'll go this way.

877
00:52:06,010 --> 00:52:07,588
I think we can do it this time.

878
00:52:08,523 --> 00:52:14,730
[The meat is grilling to perfection...]

879
00:52:14,731 --> 00:52:16,189
Okay, let's do this.

880
00:52:16,190 --> 00:52:18,053
- Pick one for Gary.
- I'm not going to look.

881
00:52:18,650 --> 00:52:21,019
[Clear out the mind...]

882
00:52:21,020 --> 00:52:22,283
Okay.

883
00:52:22,284 --> 00:52:23,946
This one?
This is the first piece?

884
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:27,465
Look at how serious we're all being.

885
00:52:28,614 --> 00:52:30,344
Okay, that's good.

886
00:52:30,345 --> 00:52:32,794
[Gary passes his turn without any burden.]

887
00:52:32,795 --> 00:52:34,967
- No, that looks good.
- Go with that one.

888
00:52:36,812 --> 00:52:39,150
[Kwang Soo is next.]

889
00:52:41,834 --> 00:52:43,903
No, flip it around.

890
00:52:43,904 --> 00:52:45,452
[I'm not looking.]

891
00:52:48,678 --> 00:52:50,891
Save the thick pieces for later.

892
00:52:51,417 --> 00:52:54,221
- Aren't all the meat pieces the same?
- No, lay that down flat.

893
00:52:54,850 --> 00:52:58,536
[Through the second step in the midst
of all the nagging.]

894
00:52:58,537 --> 00:53:00,570
- That looks good.
- I think we'll get it this time.

895
00:53:00,571 --> 00:53:02,196
- Kim Jong Kook.
- Jong Kook's turn.

896
00:53:02,197 --> 00:53:04,528
I think any one of them will work.
All the pieces look fine.

897
00:53:06,671 --> 00:53:08,899
[Kkuk picks up a larger piece...]

898
00:53:08,900 --> 00:53:11,306
- Just lay it on top.
- I think you'll be fine.

899
00:53:13,687 --> 00:53:15,433
[Very stable looking.]

900
00:53:15,434 --> 00:53:18,467
- That one looks flimsy enough.
Just seven pieces. We can do this.

901
00:53:19,332 --> 00:53:21,880
- No, the other way.
- Flip it around.

902
00:53:21,881 --> 00:53:23,783
Yes, there you go.

903
00:53:25,004 --> 00:53:27,205
- See? That's good.
- No, that's perfect.

904
00:53:27,206 --> 00:53:28,655
[Jae Suk completes his turn.]

905
00:53:34,103 --> 00:53:35,672
This is a work of art.

906
00:53:35,673 --> 00:53:36,730
[Even Big-nose Brother gets it done.]

907
00:53:36,731 --> 00:53:39,165
[Their success is right in front
of their eyes!]

908
00:53:40,992 --> 00:53:42,997
- We're almost there.
- We're going to get this done.

909
00:53:42,998 --> 00:53:44,018
The last piece!

910
00:53:44,019 --> 00:53:49,147
[Only... one person left to go.]

911
00:53:50,808 --> 00:53:52,636
- If you don't get this...
- You're going to get beat.

912
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:55,411
You're going to get beat
if you don't do this.

913
00:53:55,412 --> 00:53:57,211
We're going to beat you
on top of this grill.

914
00:53:58,154 --> 00:54:00,818
[Will he get beat on top of the grill...]

915
00:54:00,819 --> 00:54:05,614
[Or will they eat the meat on the grill?]

916
00:54:12,330 --> 00:54:14,329
[Must last for three seconds for it to count!]

917
00:54:16,790 --> 00:54:19,614
[Success]

918
00:54:21,802 --> 00:54:23,598
Party!

919
00:54:26,092 --> 00:54:29,054
<i>You can now eat as much meat
as you'd like.</i>

920
00:54:29,055 --> 00:54:30,505
[Time for the hanwoo party to start!]

921
00:54:30,506 --> 00:54:32,854
- This is great!
- This is a treat!

922
00:54:32,855 --> 00:54:35,152
<i>You're able to eat like this
because you made the right choice.</i>

923
00:54:35,153 --> 00:54:38,784
[This is only possible because they guessed
correctly on Hyun Jin's answer.]

924
00:54:55,790 --> 00:54:58,787
- Thank you for a great meal!
- Thank you!

925
00:54:58,788 --> 00:55:01,618
[Happiness level is way up!]

926
00:55:01,619 --> 00:55:05,133
- Getting the answer right means happiness.
- We have to get the next one right too.

927
00:55:05,134 --> 00:55:06,594
- Here's your next mission.
- Okay!

928
00:55:06,595 --> 00:55:09,621
[Time to choose the next mission.]

929
00:55:09,622 --> 00:55:10,655
Here you go.

930
00:55:11,052 --> 00:55:13,678
[What's the next question from Ryu Hyun Jin?]

931
00:55:13,679 --> 00:55:15,651
The next game isn't for me to do alone.

932
00:55:16,088 --> 00:55:18,312
I have a very special guest here with me.

933
00:55:18,878 --> 00:55:23,886
I'd like to introduce you to Yoo Suk Min
who has come to L.A. for a visit.

934
00:55:25,531 --> 00:55:27,511
[Ta da!]

935
00:55:28,824 --> 00:55:30,757
[He's here!
Yoo Suk Min!]

936
00:55:31,275 --> 00:55:34,364
[Korea's top right-handed pitcher,
Yoo Suk Min.]

937
00:55:34,399 --> 00:55:38,329
[The man infamous for
his razor sharp pitches.]

938
00:55:38,330 --> 00:55:41,388
[A talented pitcher that the major leagues
are clamoring for.]

939
00:55:42,501 --> 00:55:45,759
[First face-off between the top
left-handed and right-handed pitchers.]

940
00:55:46,511 --> 00:55:48,667
Hello, my name is Yoo Suk Min,
and I'm a baseball player.

941
00:55:49,847 --> 00:55:52,049
I will try to do my best.

942
00:55:52,050 --> 00:55:53,307
Thank you.

943
00:55:55,969 --> 00:55:57,372
You should come out on
our show once.

944
00:55:57,373 --> 00:56:00,908
He needs to stop by on our show before
he goes onto the major league.

945
00:56:01,617 --> 00:56:03,721
[Of course, he does.]

946
00:56:04,535 --> 00:56:06,729
Hyun Jin had to go through us too.

947
00:56:06,730 --> 00:56:10,311
- He and Gary look a lot alike.
- He does look a lot like Gary.

948
00:56:10,312 --> 00:56:12,016
We're the face of this country.

949
00:56:12,577 --> 00:56:15,887
[The three men who could pass for brothers.]

950
00:56:16,329 --> 00:56:19,722
The next game will be
Ryu Hyun Jin vs. Yoo Suk Min.

951
00:56:19,723 --> 00:56:20,944
Fighting.

952
00:56:25,963 --> 00:56:29,538
[Yoo Suk Min vs. Ryu Hyun Jin.
The face-off between the two monsters.]

953
00:56:29,539 --> 00:56:32,487
The first mission is... alkkaggi.

954
00:56:32,488 --> 00:56:34,830
[Ryu Hyun Jin vs. Yoo Suk Min.
First challenge- Alkkaggi.]

955
00:56:34,831 --> 00:56:36,384
Alkkaggi?

956
00:56:36,385 --> 00:56:39,152
- I think Hyun Jin would be good at that.
- I think Hyun Jin is going to win.

957
00:56:39,836 --> 00:56:42,157
Then should I start?

958
00:56:43,428 --> 00:56:45,928
[Alkkaggi competition... start!]

959
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:48,818
I think Yoo Suk Min will be better.

960
00:56:50,655 --> 00:56:52,307
[Ryu Hyun Jin counterattacks.]

961
00:56:52,993 --> 00:56:54,555
For the first shot...

962
00:56:55,110 --> 00:56:56,530
A straight shot.

963
00:56:59,503 --> 00:57:01,523
I don't think you're good at anything
else besides baseball.

964
00:57:03,104 --> 00:57:05,071
Get up really close... and lightly.

965
00:57:05,072 --> 00:57:06,831
Get up really close... and lightly.

966
00:57:07,905 --> 00:57:09,671
Maybe I shouldn't have done that.

967
00:57:12,046 --> 00:57:13,811
[Hyun Jin takes a clean shot and
gets the white marble out of the board.]

968
00:57:16,881 --> 00:57:19,147
[Current marble count- Four to four.]

969
00:57:21,657 --> 00:57:22,928
Straight.

970
00:57:27,567 --> 00:57:30,489
[Choose:
A- Ryu Hyun Jin wins; B- Yoo Suk Min wins.]

971
00:57:30,867 --> 00:57:32,997
It's not going to be Hyun Jin.

972
00:57:32,998 --> 00:57:35,395
- I pick Yoo Suk Min too.
- I choose Yoo Suk Min.

973
00:57:35,396 --> 00:57:38,230
- I also pick Yoo Suk Min.
- I'm going to go with Ryu Hyun Jin.

974
00:57:38,231 --> 00:57:40,058
[Gary and Jae Suk chooses Ryu Hyun Jin.]

975
00:57:40,059 --> 00:57:41,632
I also choose Ryu Hyun Jin.

976
00:57:41,633 --> 00:57:43,380
It's down to Ji Hyo again.
It's three to three.

977
00:57:43,381 --> 00:57:45,151
[The fate is in Ji Hyo's hands once again.]

978
00:57:46,604 --> 00:57:49,352
[Traitors Club is confident that their
choice B- Yoo Suk Min will be the winner.]

979
00:57:51,821 --> 00:57:54,219
Going with our decision doesn't mean
that you're betraying Hyun Jin.

980
00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:55,847
It's just about who's going to win.

981
00:57:55,848 --> 00:57:59,553
Just because I choose this... it
doesn't mean I'm betraying Ryu Hyun Jin.

982
00:58:00,107 --> 00:58:03,556
[Blank Ji also chooses 'B',
which means, Yoo Suk Min will win.]

983
00:58:03,976 --> 00:58:06,465
Yoon Suk Min!

984
00:58:06,466 --> 00:58:08,530
- One, two, three.
- Yoon Suk Min.

985
00:58:09,291 --> 00:58:14,279
<i>Since you chose Yoon Suk Min to win,
and that Ryu Hyun Jin would lose...</i>

986
00:58:14,813 --> 00:58:16,471

[Mission card 'B' is given to them.]

988
00:58:19,894 --> 00:58:25,342
<i>[B- Yoon Suk Min wins! Go to
the market for choosing Hyun Jin's loss]</i>

989
00:58:25,977 --> 00:58:28,651
[Mission 'B' location-
Off to the market!]

990
00:58:29,685 --> 00:58:31,799
I don't know if it's going to be
a tough or an easy mission.

991
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:34,315
[A world of difference between choosing
the wrong or the right answer.]

992
00:58:36,020 --> 00:58:40,175
[Did they make the correct
selection again this time?]

993
00:58:40,176 --> 00:58:41,646
Here it is.

994
00:58:42,815 --> 00:58:46,241
[Their third mission location-
The city market.]

995
00:58:46,242 --> 00:58:48,346
[Happily greeting all the shoppers.]

996
00:58:52,146 --> 00:58:53,667
Wow, it's a market.

997
00:58:54,239 --> 00:58:57,030
[Everyone's excited by
the lively market atmosphere.]

998
00:58:57,031 --> 00:58:59,892
- Wow, that rice cake looks good.
- I love rice cakes.

999
00:58:59,893 --> 00:59:01,267
[Beautiful and delicious looking
rice cakes in all shapes and colors.]

1000
00:59:01,268 --> 00:59:03,636
I want some for dessert.
Look at the fish!

1001
00:59:03,637 --> 00:59:05,131
Look at the size of that fish!

1002
00:59:05,132 --> 00:59:09,815
[Full of large and fresh seafood.]

1003
00:59:10,897 --> 00:59:12,017
It's a chicken shop.

1004
00:59:12,018 --> 00:59:13,866
[A single table at their mission location?]

1005
00:59:15,239 --> 00:59:18,308
- Is this another easy mission?
- I feel like it's going to be an easy one.

1006
00:59:18,309 --> 00:59:20,284
How could a place like this
be for a hard mission?

1007
00:59:20,285 --> 00:59:22,375
- I think we got it.
- Check the answer.

1008
00:59:22,376 --> 00:59:24,145
[Checking to see if Yoon Suk Min won.]

1009
00:59:24,146 --> 00:59:27,270
I see Myuk PD here.
Which means, we failed at our guess.

1010
00:59:30,259 --> 00:59:31,956
[Left handed Ryu Hyun Jin
vs. Right handed Yoon Suk Min.]

1011
00:59:31,957 --> 00:59:34,592
[Alkkaggi competition!
Who came out the victor?]

1012
00:59:34,593 --> 00:59:36,035
We failed.

1013
00:59:38,151 --> 00:59:39,327
Straight shot.

1014
00:59:45,343 --> 00:59:47,367
[Straight shot fails!
Current score- Ryu-3: Yoon-4.]

1015
00:59:47,368 --> 00:59:49,983
[Cheering Yoon Suk Min on
with every fiber of their being.]

1016
00:59:50,665 --> 00:59:53,256
That's the perfect shot for you.
I totally set you up.

1017
00:59:58,687 --> 01:00:00,764
- Get it out of there!
- No, not that one.

1018
01:00:00,765 --> 01:00:02,042
Yoon Suk Min!

1019
01:00:02,137 --> 01:00:04,536
- Hit it, hit it!
- Yoon Suk Min!

1020
01:00:05,012 --> 01:00:06,784
Okay, there we go.

1021
01:00:09,714 --> 01:00:12,564
It's like we're watching
these two peel eggs.

1022
01:00:17,563 --> 01:00:19,150
He just has to throw it now.

1023
01:00:19,150 --> 01:00:20,307
I think he's going to win.

1024
01:00:20,839 --> 01:00:23,251
[Player Yoon is ahead by a point]

1025
01:00:23,789 --> 01:00:26,888

It flew off. It's off.

1026

[Hyun Jin is excited about his mistake.]

1027
01:00:36,014 --> 01:00:38,372
[A crazy battle is unfolding.]

1028
01:00:38,372 --> 01:00:41,173
Can't he get one more try?

1029
01:00:42,868 --> 01:00:45,634
[Yoon Suk Min not giving up
his advantage.]

1030
01:00:45,634 --> 01:00:49,028
- That's right.
- He shouldn't give it up.

1031
01:00:55,906 --> 01:00:58,233
[That's right!]

1032
01:00:59,470 --> 01:01:00,832
[Ryu: 1, Yoon: 2]

1033
01:01:00,832 --> 01:01:02,603
Now, it's really starting.

1034
01:01:03,206 --> 01:01:04,923
One more time.

1035
01:01:06,250 --> 01:01:08,479
[What's Ryu Hyun Jin's next move?]

1036
01:01:13,137 --> 01:01:14,957
Okay!

1037
01:01:16,890 --> 01:01:18,673
[What's he so happy about?]

1038
01:01:20,588 --> 01:01:22,475
That's right. Attack!

1039
01:01:22,475 --> 01:01:25,588
But it's going to fly off.

1040
01:01:25,588 --> 01:01:29,234
[Will Player Yoon be able to win?]

1041
01:01:29,234 --> 01:01:31,466

get another chance?]

[Yoon Suk Min wins!]

1043
01:01:40,699 --> 01:01:46,608
- Yoon Suk Min!
- Yoon Suk Min!

1044
01:01:48,822 --> 01:01:50,845
I won.

1045
01:01:51,321 --> 01:01:52,778
I won.

1046
01:01:52,778 --> 01:01:55,614
It was such a short, but enjoyable time.

1047
01:01:55,614 --> 01:02:02,117
I'll work hard to take the remaining
time to get better results.

1048
01:02:02,117 --> 01:02:07,590
Since you answered the question correctly,
I will throw this ball to you.

1049
01:02:09,603 --> 01:02:11,964
- Okay!
- Give it to Ji Hyo.

1050
01:02:11,964 --> 01:02:13,626
Give it to her!

1051
01:02:15,321 --> 01:02:17,603
[Yoon Suk Min's signed ball]

1052
01:02:18,133 --> 01:02:20,952
But I left my signed ball over there.

1053
01:02:21,411 --> 01:02:23,515
I left it at the restaurant.

1054
01:02:28,220 --> 01:02:31,957
[When everyone lost their
minds over the meat...]

1055

[Haroro claims the rare item.]

1056
01:02:40,179 --> 01:02:41,754
I'll have to tell my manager
to go and get it.

1057
01:02:45,122 --> 01:02:49,566
Hey Hyun Bin, at that meat place...

1058
01:02:49,566 --> 01:02:51,702
There's a signed ball.
You have to bring it back.

1059
01:02:55,229 --> 01:02:57,875
<i>Okay everyone.
It's the right answer.</i>

1060
01:02:57,875 --> 01:03:00,267
<i>Congratulations.</i>

1061
01:03:00,267 --> 01:03:02,479
- I think we get a gift.
- Something yummy?

1062
01:03:02,479 --> 01:03:05,491
<i>Everyone, it's really a relief
you got the right answer.</i>

1063
01:03:05,491 --> 01:03:08,714
<i>- If you had been wrong...
- What would've happened?</i>

1064
01:03:08,714 --> 01:03:11,629
<i>- Remember the paper boats you made?
- Yes.</i>

1065
01:03:11,629 --> 01:03:13,777
<i>Your boats would've had
to pass through the Geum River.</i>

1066
01:03:16,887 --> 01:03:19,987
<i>- You really would've had to.
- Really?</i>

1067
01:03:19,987 --> 01:03:22,358
<i>But we've pulled out of those plans.</i>

1068
01:03:22,358 --> 01:03:26,759
<i>- That's ridiculous!
- We're not lying.</i>

1069
01:03:27,805 --> 01:03:30,915
[However!]

1070
01:03:30,915 --> 01:03:33,111
[In reality, they prepared for it.]

1071
01:03:34,593 --> 01:03:36,712
We could've been in big trouble.

1072
01:03:38,211 --> 01:03:40,427
We should do it. Why not?

1073
01:03:40,427 --> 01:03:43,073
It's going to take 12 hours.

1074
01:03:43,370 --> 01:03:46,504
- It starts in the morning.
- You think it's possible?

1075
01:03:46,504 --> 01:03:48,320
Didn't you watch me cross it?

1076
01:03:48,320 --> 01:03:51,175
You crossed it barely
floating above water.

1077
01:03:51,668 --> 01:03:54,667
- You were drowning.
- This is crazy.

1078
01:03:54,667 --> 01:03:59,355
<i>Since you were correct, here
is a simpler mission.</i>

1079
01:03:59,355 --> 01:04:03,898
<i>- One for each.
- Looks cute.</i>

1080
01:04:03,898 --> 01:04:06,283
<i>Please look over your
mission statements.</i>

1081
01:04:07,849 --> 01:04:11,731
<i>Your fourth mission is
a marketplace word game.</i>

1082
01:04:12,164 --> 01:04:13,841
I think I know what this is.

1083
01:04:13,841 --> 01:04:15,697
We have to buy the items.

1084
01:04:15,697 --> 01:04:19,720
<i>The first item,
we'll tell you what it is.</i>

1085
01:04:19,720 --> 01:04:24,592
<i>You'll have to buy another item that
starts with the last letter of the first item.</i>

1086
01:04:24,592 --> 01:04:26,895
<i>- Oh, so we have to buy it?
- Yes.</i>

1087
01:04:26,895 --> 01:04:28,619
<i>Then it goes on to the next person.</i>

1088
01:04:28,619 --> 01:04:30,808
<i>- Can't you write it out for us?
- We can't.</i>

1089
01:04:30,808 --> 01:04:33,307
<i>- Can we suggest items?
- You can't.</i>

1090
01:04:33,307 --> 01:04:35,847
<i>We will start right away.</i>

1091
01:04:37,144 --> 01:04:38,663
Ready?

1092
01:04:38,663 --> 01:04:41,681
<i>Okay, the first item.</i>

1093
01:04:43,335 --> 01:04:44,549
Gan Jang (soy sauce).

1094
01:04:46,391 --> 01:04:48,726
- Jang Jo Rim (boiled beef).
- Jang Jo Rim!

1095
01:04:49,798 --> 01:04:51,996
- It doesn't matter.
- Don't bother brainstorming.

1096
01:04:51,996 --> 01:04:54,988
Jang. Jang. Jang.
Jang Uh (eel).

1097
01:04:54,988 --> 01:04:56,353
Jang Uh. Jang Uh. Jang Uh.

1098
01:04:56,945 --> 01:04:59,653
Jang Uh. Jang Uh. Jang Uh.

1099
01:04:59,653 --> 01:05:02,736
- Gan Jang is over there.
- Not gan jang. Jang Uh.

1100
01:05:04,409 --> 01:05:06,824
He's there.

1101
01:05:11,811 --> 01:05:14,249
Do you have Jang Gi (Korean chess)?
Or Jang Gap (gloves)?

1102
01:05:14,815 --> 01:05:17,391
Jang Gi. Or Jang Gab.

1103
01:05:17,391 --> 01:05:20,536
Do you? Oh Jang Gab.
Anything. That'll do.

1104
01:05:20,536 --> 01:05:23,011
How much are the gloves?
W1500?

1105
01:05:24,905 --> 01:05:26,722
That should be enough.

1106
01:05:26,722 --> 01:05:28,958
Thank you!
But the gloves...

1107
01:05:29,588 --> 01:05:34,087
- Jang Gap. Jang Sik.
- Jang Gi.

1108
01:05:34,087 --> 01:05:35,307
That's all.

1109
01:05:36,823 --> 01:05:38,139
Jang Mun (letter).

1110
01:05:38,139 --> 01:05:39,629
Are you kidding?

1111
01:05:43,161 --> 01:05:44,888
Okay, so it's Jang Gab (gloves).

1112
01:05:44,888 --> 01:05:47,448
- Gab, gab.
- What starts with Gab?

1113
01:05:47,448 --> 01:05:51,941
Gab. Gab. Gab.

1114
01:05:55,071 --> 01:05:59,142
[What starts with gap?]

1115
01:05:59,142 --> 01:06:02,023
- What are you thinking about Jae Suk?
- Uh Mook (fishcake).

1116
01:06:02,023 --> 01:06:05,336
From Gab Oh Jing Uh (octopus)?
What if she doesn't bring that?

1117
01:06:05,336 --> 01:06:08,778
I'm pretty sure there is no
Gab Oh Jing Uh.

1118
01:06:09,565 --> 01:06:11,364
Oh, wait a second.

1119
01:06:11,637 --> 01:06:13,843
[She spots the octopus!]

1120
01:06:13,843 --> 01:06:18,266
Sir, do you have Gab Oh Jing Uh?

1121
01:06:18,266 --> 01:06:21,371
- It's not in season.
- Oh really?

1122
01:06:21,371 --> 01:06:25,847
Gab. Gab. Gab.

1123
01:06:25,847 --> 01:06:28,372
Sir, do you have Gab Oh Jing Uh?

1124
01:06:28,372 --> 01:06:30,341
- Gab Oh Jing Uh?
- We don't.

1125
01:06:30,968 --> 01:06:35,597
Gab. Gab.

1126
01:06:37,621 --> 01:06:39,773
What starts with Gab?

1127
01:06:39,773 --> 01:06:42,186
- Gab.
- Gab?

1128
01:06:42,186 --> 01:06:44,583
Gab Oh Jing Uh!
But that won't do.

1129
01:06:44,583 --> 01:06:46,278
Gab Oh Jing Uh.

1130
01:06:46,278 --> 01:06:48,484
Gab.

1131
01:06:48,484 --> 01:06:52,385
I really wonder what she's
going to bring. Gab Oh Jing Uh?

1132
01:06:53,361 --> 01:06:56,220
[She seems to have bought something.]

1133
01:06:58,302 --> 01:07:01,142
What starts with Gab?

1134
01:07:01,142 --> 01:07:02,949
What are you doing?

1135
01:07:02,949 --> 01:07:04,901
There's no Gab Oh Jing Uh.

1136
01:07:04,901 --> 01:07:06,730
Then just buy regular
octopus and insist it's Gab.

1137
01:07:11,476 --> 01:07:13,772
How much is the cabbage?

1138
01:07:16,168 --> 01:07:17,975
She bought something!

1139
01:07:17,975 --> 01:07:21,390
Cabbage with a high Gab (price).

1140
01:07:21,390 --> 01:07:24,643
- Cabbage with a high Gab.
- This is tricky.

1141
01:07:24,643 --> 01:07:26,050
[Time's up.]

1142
01:07:26,050 --> 01:07:29,849
This is frustrating.

1143
01:07:29,849 --> 01:07:31,864
Time out.

1144
01:07:31,864 --> 01:07:33,515
Let's fight for this.

1145
01:07:33,515 --> 01:07:35,143
If we don't get this,
we can't win.

1146
01:07:35,143 --> 01:07:38,800
Come prepared with an argument.

1147
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:42,007
[They dare to change the rules
in front of the producers.]

1148
01:07:42,718 --> 01:07:44,940
[Totally adamant.]

1149
01:07:46,425 --> 01:07:48,071
Let's be self-righteous.

1150
01:07:48,071 --> 01:07:49,375
Okay!

1151
01:07:49,375 --> 01:07:52,407
We have to be careful with our words.

1152
01:07:52,407 --> 01:07:53,707
Okay, let's resume.

1153
01:07:54,165 --> 01:07:57,685
Let's use our heads.

1154
01:07:57,685 --> 01:07:59,427
Reveal the item!

1155
01:08:00,676 --> 01:08:03,488
Ryu Hyun Jin.

1156
01:08:08,889 --> 01:08:09,905
How much is this?

1157
01:08:09,905 --> 01:08:11,962
Ma'am, how much is this?

1158
01:08:11,962 --> 01:08:14,850
What? This. How much
are the Go Chu (peppers)?

1159
01:08:15,013 --> 01:08:16,648
[Go Chu doesn't start with 'Jin'.]

1160
01:08:17,369 --> 01:08:19,157
Something very (Jin Jja) good.

1161
01:08:19,157 --> 01:08:21,292
A very (Jin Jja) tasty apple.

1162
01:08:21,292 --> 01:08:22,709
This is too much.

1163
01:08:22,709 --> 01:08:24,051
What do you mean?

1164
01:08:24,051 --> 01:08:26,713
You never said we couldn't.

1165
01:08:26,713 --> 01:08:30,397
A very (Jin Jja) good, new...

1166
01:08:30,397 --> 01:08:32,690
[Ha Ha returns]

1167
01:08:32,690 --> 01:08:35,182
[What's his item?]

1168
01:08:35,182 --> 01:08:37,784
A very (Jin jja) spicy pepper.

1169
01:08:37,784 --> 01:08:40,522
Very good.
This is how you do it.

1170
01:08:40,522 --> 01:08:42,268
Please give me a radish.

1171
01:08:42,268 --> 01:08:44,856
[It's supposed to start with Chu.]

1172
01:08:44,856 --> 01:08:46,865
Go ahead, go ahead.

1173
01:08:51,007 --> 01:08:52,957
Chu Uk's (memory's) radish.

1174
01:08:53,736 --> 01:08:55,958
Mu. Mu.

1175
01:08:55,958 --> 01:09:00,900
- A radish representing mother's touch.
- The past is coming back.

1176
01:09:00,900 --> 01:09:04,077
This radish means a lot to me.

1177
01:09:04,077 --> 01:09:06,211
Everyone has a memory about radishes.

1178
01:09:06,211 --> 01:09:08,845
Do you have to go by 'Mu' or 'Ooh'?

1179
01:09:08,845 --> 01:09:10,875
- Go by Mu.
- Just Mu?

1180
01:09:13,241 --> 01:09:15,461
Don't be worried Suk Jin.

1181
01:09:18,187 --> 01:09:22,957
Scarily (Mu Sub Gae) delicious kimchi!

1182
01:09:27,045 --> 01:09:29,554
- Scary! Scary!
- Chi?

1183
01:09:31,701 --> 01:09:33,539
Don't get nervous.

1184
01:09:33,716 --> 01:09:36,662
This is a hidden camera prank, right?

1185
01:09:38,003 --> 01:09:40,292
Surprisingly, only a minute
and forty seconds have gone by.

1186
01:09:41,040 --> 01:09:42,706
It's been a success so far.

1187
01:09:42,706 --> 01:09:45,429
- We can do it.
- I'm going to do this no matter what.

1188
01:09:45,429 --> 01:09:47,435
- That's right.
- At all costs.

1189
01:09:48,811 --> 01:09:50,997
- What is it?
- Chi Yak (toothpaste).

1190
01:09:50,997 --> 01:09:53,416
Very good.

1191
01:09:55,743 --> 01:09:58,099
That definitely passes.

1192
01:09:59,560 --> 01:10:01,404
What starts with Yak?

1193
01:10:01,926 --> 01:10:04,556
Is Suk Jin just standing out there?

1194
01:10:05,188 --> 01:10:09,321
- He's getting Yak Soo (mineral water).
- He doesn't have to be too ambitious.

1195
01:10:09,847 --> 01:10:11,765
Something a weak (Yak) man eats.

1196
01:10:11,765 --> 01:10:13,112
One minute and thirty seconds left.

1197
01:10:13,112 --> 01:10:15,292
- Where is he?
- What a weak (yak) man eats.

1198
01:10:15,292 --> 01:10:17,802
Or a slightly (Yak Gan) spicy pepper.

1199
01:10:17,802 --> 01:10:21,918
[Quiet]

1200
01:10:21,918 --> 01:10:23,795
He's here. Suk Jin.

1201
01:10:23,795 --> 01:10:29,366
[He was so nervous about this.]
[What does he bring eventually?]

1202
01:10:29,366 --> 01:10:31,720
Yak Gwa (flour cookies)!

1203
01:10:31,720 --> 01:10:35,285
[Doesn't try to be too creative.]

1204
01:10:39,282 --> 01:10:41,148
That's refreshing.

1205
01:10:41,148 --> 01:10:42,670
Don't you think?

1206
01:10:42,670 --> 01:10:45,195
Yak Gwa is totally refreshing.

1207
01:10:46,049 --> 01:10:49,026
We thought you'd do something
like what a weak (yak) man eats.

1208
01:10:49,631 --> 01:10:51,691
Thirty seconds left.

1209
01:10:54,050 --> 01:10:57,340
- Where's Ji Hyo?
- It's Gwa.

1210
01:10:57,340 --> 01:10:58,900
Where did she go?

1211
01:11:01,771 --> 01:11:03,245
Gwa Ja (cookies).

1212
01:11:03,245 --> 01:11:06,466
- Ja. Ja.
- Twenty seconds!

1213
01:11:06,466 --> 01:11:09,221
Just buy anything.

1214
01:11:09,221 --> 01:11:11,584
Boo Choo (chives).

1215
01:11:11,584 --> 01:11:13,662
What is this?

1216
01:11:13,662 --> 01:11:15,280
How much are the spring onions?

1217
01:11:15,280 --> 01:11:19,182
Ten seconds!

1218
01:11:22,861 --> 01:11:25,572
W500.

1219
01:11:25,572 --> 01:11:30,703
[No time! He has to go back!]

1220
01:11:30,703 --> 01:11:36,514
[How will the spring onions
start with Ja?]

1221
01:11:36,514 --> 01:11:42,497
Here (Ja)! Spring onions!

1222
01:11:43,888 --> 01:11:46,564
[What?]

1223
01:11:46,564 --> 01:11:49,057
That won't work.

1224
01:11:49,057 --> 01:11:51,214
Here, spring onions. Ja Pa.

1225
01:11:51,214 --> 01:11:55,479
Ja Pa. Look closely. Pa!

1226
01:11:55,479 --> 01:11:57,508
[Mission Fail]

1227
01:11:57,508 --> 01:11:58,700
What's wrong with Ja Pa?

1228
01:11:59,661 --> 01:12:03,605
A parent's thought of a child (Ja Sik)
as they grew this onion.

1229
01:12:03,605 --> 01:12:05,344
Seriously.

1230
01:12:05,344 --> 01:12:08,375
Ja, peppers.
Ja, radish. Ja, kimchi.

1231
01:12:08,375 --> 01:12:11,388
This is a good finale.

1232
01:12:11,388 --> 01:12:12,782
Ja, pa!

1233
01:12:12,782 --> 01:12:14,421
It's a good ending.

1234
01:12:14,421 --> 01:12:16,473
But you weren't as confident before.

1235
01:12:16,473 --> 01:12:18,461
H... here. Pa.

1236
01:12:18,461 --> 01:12:22,056
You should have really
committed to it.

1237
01:12:22,871 --> 01:12:24,189
If you had done better.

1238
01:12:24,189 --> 01:12:29,245
Since the producers have opened
their hearts, just bring whatever.

1239
01:12:31,911 --> 01:12:33,938
<i>We'll reveal the item.</i>

1240
01:12:35,952 --> 01:12:37,750
Ya Gu (baseball).

1241
01:12:38,814 --> 01:12:40,275
Gu Du (slipper).

1242
01:12:40,275 --> 01:12:42,716
Feeling as if you are floating
on a cloud (Gu Rum).

1243
01:12:43,562 --> 01:12:45,339
Gu Rum Bal (a strip of cloud).

1244
01:12:49,677 --> 01:12:52,468
Gu! This, this!

1245
01:12:53,847 --> 01:12:57,841
[Buying shoe polish might be faster.]

1246
01:12:58,416 --> 01:13:02,281
[What will Gary buy?]

1247
01:13:02,281 --> 01:13:04,405
Delicious (Gu Su Han) river snails!

1248
01:13:05,442 --> 01:13:08,409
Woo Rung?

1249
01:13:08,409 --> 01:13:14,040
No, it's Woo Rung Yi.
Has to start with Yi.

1250
01:13:15,020 --> 01:13:16,852
Nice job. Woo Rung Yi.

1251
01:13:18,498 --> 01:13:21,334
Yi. Yi. Yi.

1252
01:13:21,334 --> 01:13:23,655
How much is this?

1253
01:13:23,655 --> 01:13:26,270
- W8000 for all of it.
- Like this?

1254
01:13:26,270 --> 01:13:29,685
Here you go.
Yes, I'll take everything.

1255
01:13:33,487 --> 01:13:35,926
She's coming. She's fast.

1256
01:13:35,926 --> 01:13:39,838
Pretty (Yi Bbeun) baby radish.

1257
01:13:41,226 --> 01:13:45,838
- Nice!
- It's really pretty.

1258
01:13:46,957 --> 01:13:48,883
[Why couldn't I think of that?]

1259
01:13:50,308 --> 01:13:52,089
- It was W8000.
- Really?

1260
01:13:52,089 --> 01:13:54,671
- How could it be so pretty?
- Right? It's pretty.

1261
01:13:54,671 --> 01:13:57,950
Ji Hyo, the look on your
face was so pretty before.

1262
01:13:57,950 --> 01:14:00,947
Scarily (Mu Sub Gae) delicious kimchi.

1263
01:14:00,947 --> 01:14:04,253
Kimchi. Chi! Chi!

1264
01:14:04,253 --> 01:14:07,446
Chi, chi. Should we
go for the fish oil?

1265
01:14:13,103 --> 01:14:17,744
Number of people left is three.
Time left is two minutes and thirty seconds.

1266
01:14:20,338 --> 01:14:22,120
We've become so close
with the market lady.

1267
01:14:22,120 --> 01:14:24,665
She calls me her son.

1268
01:14:30,575 --> 01:14:32,990
Chi Yak (toothpaste)!

1269
01:14:34,053 --> 01:14:36,724
- Chi Yak!
- Nice!

1270
01:14:37,236 --> 01:14:40,049
- Suk Jin's so refreshing.
- Don't you think?

1271
01:14:40,049 --> 01:14:41,891
There's no wit, but it's refreshing.

1272
01:14:47,857 --> 01:14:52,002
Red peppers that make
weak (yak han) men get right up!

1273
01:14:52,002 --> 01:14:54,466
Now, it's Chu!

1274
01:14:56,605 --> 01:14:57,759
What is this?

1275
01:14:57,759 --> 01:14:59,757
If we don't do it,
we can't succeed.

1276
01:14:59,757 --> 01:15:02,547
- What do we do?
- It's fine. Chi Yak works.

1277
01:15:03,574 --> 01:15:06,247
[The game works without being creative.]

1278
01:15:06,247 --> 01:15:09,202
You could have just gotten Yak Gwa.
Why make it so complicated?

1279
01:15:09,708 --> 01:15:11,265
Next, next.

1280
01:15:14,686 --> 01:15:18,201
It's cold (Chu Wuh)! Cold.
That's how we got the cinnamon bark.

1281
01:15:20,273 --> 01:15:22,388
Gye Pi. Gye Pi.

1282
01:15:22,388 --> 01:15:24,929
Hurry up, go!

1283
01:15:26,042 --> 01:15:30,003
Ma'am. Ma'am.

1284
01:15:30,003 --> 01:15:32,598
Wow, Gye Pi is the best when it's cold.

1285
01:15:33,360 --> 01:15:36,337
[Continues to plead his case.]

1286
01:15:36,337 --> 01:15:37,951
Is it cold outside?

1287
01:15:38,683 --> 01:15:41,641
[The last one!]
[What's Jae Suk's answer?]

1288
01:15:50,547 --> 01:15:54,135
Through blood-inducing (pi nan) efforts

1289
01:15:54,135 --> 01:15:57,130
the farmer has grown...
onions!

1290
01:15:58,502 --> 01:16:02,267
[Finale: Through blood-inducing efforts
the farmer has grown onions!]

1291
01:16:03,521 --> 01:16:05,889
You could have just bought
Pi Mang (bell peppers).

1292
01:16:05,889 --> 01:16:09,689
[Anyway, it's acceptable.]

1293
01:16:09,689 --> 01:16:12,996
<i>Now, we'll go over all the items.</i>

1294
01:16:14,364 --> 01:16:17,064
Delicious (Gu Su) king snails (Woo Rung Yi).

1295
01:16:17,064 --> 01:16:19,457
Pretty (Yi Bbeun) baby
radishes (Chong Gak Mu).

1296
01:16:19,457 --> 01:16:21,480
Scarily (Mu Sub Gae) delicious kimchi.

1297
01:16:21,480 --> 01:16:22,986
Toothpaste (Chi Yak).

1298
01:16:22,986 --> 01:16:26,043
Red peppers (Go Chu) that make
weak (Yak Han) men get right up.

1299
01:16:26,043 --> 01:16:28,881
It's cold (Chu Wuh),
so you get Cinnamon Bark (Gye Pi)!

1300
01:16:28,881 --> 01:16:33,673
Through blood-inducing (pi nan) efforts
the farmer gives us onions!

1301
01:16:33,673 --> 01:16:35,280
[Mission accomplished!]

1302
01:16:35,280 --> 01:16:38,221
The last one was a clincher.

1303
01:16:39,020 --> 01:16:42,353
There's a phone call for you all.

1304
01:16:42,353 --> 01:16:44,423
Who is it?

1305
01:16:44,423 --> 01:16:45,694
Hello?

1306
01:16:45,694 --> 01:16:46,702
<i>Hello?</i>

1307
01:16:46,702 --> 01:16:47,934
Yes, hello.

1308
01:16:47,934 --> 01:16:49,430
<i>This is Ryu Hyun Jin.</i>

1309
01:16:50,294 --> 01:16:52,652
Hyun Jin!

1310
01:16:52,652 --> 01:16:54,790
<i>I'm at Incheon now.</i>

1311
01:16:54,790 --> 01:16:59,506
- Hurry up. Hurry here.
- We have to rip your name tag off!

1312
01:17:00,203 --> 01:17:01,560
Let's face off Ryu Hyun Jin!

1313
01:17:01,560 --> 01:17:04,139
<i>Since Jong Kook can't face me...</i>

1314
01:17:04,743 --> 01:17:07,830
I let you off easy last time.

1315
01:17:07,830 --> 01:17:09,241
He just let you off.

1316
01:17:09,241 --> 01:17:11,925
<i>Did you do the mission?</i>

1317
01:17:11,925 --> 01:17:14,757
Of course. We did everything.

1318
01:17:15,680 --> 01:17:18,309
- Wasn't it hard?
- Totally hard!

1319
01:17:20,153 --> 01:17:23,409
- We love you Ryu!
- See you next time!

1320
01:17:23,409 --> 01:17:25,367
- Bye!
- Bye!

1321
01:17:26,199 --> 01:17:31,029
<i>Okay now, it's the last
question for today.</i>

1322
01:17:31,733 --> 01:17:34,228
<i>Think carefully before you choose.</i>

1323
01:17:34,735 --> 01:17:37,660
- Come over here to look.
- Let's look together.

1324
01:17:37,660 --> 01:17:38,909
Here you go.

- He won't have the jjamppong first.
- First, he'll have jjajangmyun.

Hey, bingo!

01:31:31,043 --> 01:31:33,583
Nice to see you!

1501
01:31:33,583 --> 01:31:35,827
Let's start off by hugging.

1502
01:31:35,827 --> 01:31:39,336
I'm sorry. I love you.
I can't help it.

1503
01:31:43,274 --> 01:31:46,540
Oh my. We're sorry Baek Hyun.

1504
01:31:46,958 --> 01:31:50,703
<i>Baek Hyun, out.</i>

1505
01:31:55,092 --> 01:31:56,916
I'm in trouble.

1506
01:32:08,702 --> 01:32:11,022
[By any chance?]

1507
01:32:14,389 --> 01:32:17,705
[EXO's D.O. discovered.]

1508
01:32:17,705 --> 01:32:19,317
[He found a novel place to hide.]

1509
01:32:19,317 --> 01:32:21,866
Sorry about this D.O.

1510
01:32:23,874 --> 01:32:25,779
- Hello.
- We're sorry about this.

1511
01:32:25,779 --> 01:32:28,788
Thank you.

1512
01:32:28,788 --> 01:32:31,794
[So polite even after defeat.]

1513
01:32:31,794 --> 01:32:36,148
- You really scared us.
- I thought I could avoid being found.

1514
01:32:36,148 --> 01:32:39,468
<i>D.O. out.</i>

1515
01:32:39,468 --> 01:32:41,519
No way.

1516
01:32:42,019 --> 01:32:44,324
Who... who did all the ripping?

1517
01:32:44,324 --> 01:32:46,899
Did Jong Kook really get out?

1518
01:32:46,899 --> 01:32:51,355
Jong Kook. Jong Kook.
Is he really out?

1519
01:32:51,355 --> 01:32:53,838
But we're still getting
all these players out?

1520
01:32:53,838 --> 01:32:57,006
This is ridiculous.

1521
01:32:57,823 --> 01:33:01,270
I see the kids over there.

1522
01:33:02,455 --> 01:33:04,334
Come down, come down.

1523
01:33:04,334 --> 01:33:07,394
We got him!

1524
01:33:09,120 --> 01:33:11,430
Nice to see you.
Stay here Xiumin.

01:33:35,432 --> 01:33:39,299
EXO's right here.

1531
01:33:39,299 --> 01:33:43,168
- There he is.
- EXO's over here!

1532
01:33:43,168 --> 01:33:47,770
- Hello!
- We're here.

What will happen next?]

[Next week. D-day!]

1540
01:34:24,666 --> 01:34:27,099
- It's time to spit it out.
- Wait!

1541
01:34:27,099 --> 01:34:29,775
