[The answer lies within today's mission?]

9
00:00:55,068 --> 00:00:58,987
- I think we need to look at the numbers.
- 14357?

10
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:04,190
[In that case...]

[The number that has been
stamped on their hands...]

12

Make sure to remember that number.

13
00:01:23,012 --> 00:01:25,263
What if I add all the numbers together?

14
00:01:25,264 --> 00:01:27,770
[Plus 11...]

15
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:30,126
[One by one...]

16

[Bicycle locker within the train station.]

18
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:39,116
[The number that they spent
all day chasing after...]

19
00:01:43,332 --> 00:01:45,914
[That number is none other than...]

20
00:01:47,782 --> 00:01:52,367
[But I was still unaware until
this morning.]

21
00:01:52,368 --> 00:01:58,636

since the last time they've seen him.]

26
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:13,667
- I can feel the muscles in your arms.
- I just have a thick layer of clothes on.

27
00:02:14,431 --> 00:02:16,826
I wore a lot of layers
because it's so cold out.

28
00:02:18,826 --> 00:02:21,407
[Let me check Kang Gary out too.]

29
00:02:22,637 --> 00:02:26,069
[Shapeless older brothers getting handsy

- Kang Gary is really soft, Jae Suk.
- Really?

31
00:02:30,556 --> 00:02:34,305
- He's really soft.
- It's because I have a soft heart.

32
00:02:34,306 --> 00:02:35,402
[Soft bodied and soft hearted Gary.]

33
00:02:35,403 --> 00:02:38,247
I feel a bit nervous since
I haven't been on the show for so long.

34
00:02:38,248 --> 00:02:40,347
- Why are you saying that? So unlike you.
- There's no need to be nervous.

35
00:02:40,348 --> 00:02:43,323
- It's been a year since he's been on.
- Has it been a year already?

36

[Last visit was the 007 special episode.]

37
00:02:45,325 --> 00:02:47,955
To be honest,
I still don't understand this show.

38
00:02:48,545 --> 00:02:50,895
I still have no idea
how the 007 episode ended.

39
00:02:50,896 --> 00:02:54,861
It's not just you, Seung Gi.
That episode is a mystery to us all.

40

than I do these days.

- I'm jealous.
- What's going on?

53
00:03:40,083 --> 00:03:43,166
Sistar is one of my favorite girl groups.

54
00:03:43,167 --> 00:03:48,627
I also asked her to join me onstage for
a segment at my recent concert as well.

55
00:03:49,637 --> 00:03:53,431
- Did you dress up as a woman?
- No, I didn't dress up as a woman.

56
00:03:53,432 --> 00:03:55,516
- Isn't that what you did?
- No, I didn't do that.

57
00:03:55,517 --> 00:03:58,285
I stopped doing things like that.
No, I'm not doing that.

58
00:03:58,286 --> 00:04:00,504
You should just give me a call.
My Sistar imitation is awesome.

59
00:04:00,505 --> 00:04:03,462
- He's unbelievable.
- Jong Kook is another Sistar member.

60

- Jong Kook could be another Hyorin.
- Yeah, I could be Hyorin.

61

- You never used to be like that.
- I never used to, but...

63

used to be during the X-Man days.

64

- Bora and Seung Gi are our only guests?
- Are these two it?

65
00:04:18,919 --> 00:04:20,657

taken away to?]

- This is too much this early in the morning.
- Do you all see the flying chairs?

- Then what?
- The loser will be eliminated.

105
00:06:42,061 --> 00:06:44,772
And the next person will take over
the empty seat to continue the game

106
00:06:44,773 --> 00:06:48,226
and the person who survives to the end
without being thrown in the water wins.

107
00:06:48,227 --> 00:06:50,306
So this is an all-kill method
we're playing?

108
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:54,397
Then we will now designate the order of
who will sit in the chairs first.

109
00:06:54,398 --> 00:06:56,189
[Designating the order of who'll go first

- The dizziness is making me dizzy.
- I feel like I'm going to get flown off this.

116
00:07:11,998 --> 00:07:14,775
Just hurry up and play the game.

117
00:07:14,776 --> 00:07:16,428
Are you both ready?

118
00:07:16,429 --> 00:07:19,445

flown into the water by the flying chair?]

119

[They both throw out paper.]

120
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,747
If they tie,
shouldn't they both be thrown off?

121
00:07:25,747 --> 00:07:27,558
That's not a bad idea.

122
00:07:28,346 --> 00:07:29,776
Again.

123
00:07:29,777 --> 00:07:31,845

[A man clad in black appears
out of nowhere again...]

130

- What is that?
- He's being taken away.

131
00:07:57,978 --> 00:07:59,942
- Why is he being taken away?
- Where is he being taken to?

132
00:07:59,943 --> 00:08:01,962
- Why?
- He's being taken away somewhere.

133
00:08:01,963 --> 00:08:04,452
- Is he being dragged away?
- He's being dragged away somewhere.

134
00:08:04,453 --> 00:08:05,829
Where are you taking him?

135
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:08,662
[Hauled away the moment
he's catapulted into the water.]

136
00:08:08,663 --> 00:08:10,394
Are we teamed up with those guards?

137
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:13,792
- Where are they taking me?
- They're taking you away somewhere.

138

[Just where is he being led away to?]

139
00:08:15,443 --> 00:08:17,658
I want to stay and watch!

140
00:08:19,785 --> 00:08:22,336
- Where is he being taken away to?
- Bye!

141
00:08:23,109 --> 00:08:25,326
This really is like a mystery theater.

142
00:08:25,327 --> 00:08:27,316
If you're going to do this,
make it so that we never see him again.

143

[Number four- Kwang Soo.]

144
00:08:38,769 --> 00:08:40,607

help you onto the platform...]

Good job, Seung Gi.

147
00:08:51,264 --> 00:08:53,289
I'm going to bet everything I have
on winning this round.

148
00:08:54,278 --> 00:08:56,473
He's always betting
everything he has these days.

149
00:08:56,474 --> 00:08:58,971
That's because Kwang Soo doesn't have
all that much to his name yet.

150
00:08:58,972 --> 00:09:02,252
I want to beat Kwang Soo at least
before I'm thrown into the water.

151
00:09:02,253 --> 00:09:04,663
[Seung Gi showing an unusual streak of
competitiveness against Kwang Soo.]

152

a bit of a dirty player.

153
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:11,442
- You have to watch yourself, Seung Gi.
- No hesitating to test me, okay?

154
00:09:11,443 --> 00:09:12,844
Okay.

155

[Huh?]

157
00:09:22,286 --> 00:09:23,664
Okay, I'm ready.

158
00:09:23,665 --> 00:09:25,884
- Didn't you already do it?
- No, we're going to start now.

159

[What just happened?]

160
00:09:28,062 --> 00:09:30,405
No, that was just me showing you
that's how the game is going to be played.

161
00:09:30,675 --> 00:09:32,834
- No, that was our game, and you lost.
- You guys already played your hand.

162
00:09:32,835 --> 00:09:33,935
[Kwang Soo loses.
Plenty of witnesses to testify.]

163
00:09:33,936 --> 00:09:36,174
- No, we didn't see it.
- Yes, you did!

164
00:09:36,878 --> 00:09:38,854
- Rewind the tape.
- There's no need to rewind anything.

165
00:09:38,855 --> 00:09:40,639
- What just happened?
- We didn't see what happened.

166
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:44,631
No, but we didn't give you the cue
to start playing rock, paper, scissors.

167
00:09:45,505 --> 00:09:47,786
[Excited and relieved Giraffe.]

168
00:09:47,787 --> 00:09:49,876
Fine, then instead of rock paper scissors,
let's play mook-jji-ppa.

169
00:09:49,877 --> 00:09:51,470
[What?
All of a sudden?]

170
00:09:51,471 --> 00:09:55,258
I was going to say that from the beginning,
but you interrupted me.

171
00:09:55,752 --> 00:09:59,155
Seriously... you don't know how to play
a fair and clean game, do you?

172
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:01,955
Where have you been?
You know I've always played dirty.

173
00:10:03,027 --> 00:10:05,076
Let's just be honest here.

174
00:10:06,278 --> 00:10:08,236
I told you that he plays dirty.

175
00:10:08,237 --> 00:10:11,121
- Let's just go for it since you admitted it.
- Okay, thanks, Seung Gi.

176
00:10:11,122 --> 00:10:13,878
[Agreeing to play mook-jji-ppa
for this round only.]

177
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:16,396
Okay, here we go.
Rock, paper, scissors.

178
00:10:17,294 --> 00:10:20,447
[It would've been Seung Gi's win if it
had been just plain rock, paper, scissors.]

179
00:10:20,448 --> 00:10:21,972
Mook, jji!

180
00:10:26,345 --> 00:10:28,550
[Giraffe's forceful attack is making
Seung Gi's hand shake in fear.]

181
00:10:31,912 --> 00:10:34,011
[Seung Gi loses.]

182
00:10:35,651 --> 00:10:37,866
[Ah...]

183
00:10:37,867 --> 00:10:42,835
[I, in the end...
fell for Giraffe's dirty ploys.]

184
00:10:44,343 --> 00:10:47,437
[Tricky Giraffe wins!]

185
00:10:50,117 --> 00:10:53,141
That's too bad, Seung Gi.
It was your win in the beginning.

186
00:10:54,019 --> 00:10:56,127
I really wanted to beat Kwang Soo.

187
00:10:56,128 --> 00:10:58,385
- Sorry, Seung Gi.
- I really wanted Seung Gi to win!

188
00:10:59,072 --> 00:11:01,744
[Next up is Number Five, Hye Jin.]

189
00:11:03,136 --> 00:11:04,740
I'm really nervous!

190
00:11:05,867 --> 00:11:07,844
[So nervous!]

191
00:11:07,845 --> 00:11:10,097
The marriage has made her weak!

192
00:11:10,891 --> 00:11:13,503
You're not normally like this, Hye Jin.

193
00:11:13,504 --> 00:11:17,892
- You're going to have to re-train yourself.
- I have a family to think about now.

194
00:11:18,682 --> 00:11:20,415
What is she saying?

195
00:11:21,475 --> 00:11:24,129
[All-kill flying chair,
Hye Jin vs. Kwang Soo.]

196
00:11:28,241 --> 00:11:29,600
Wait!
Wait a minute!

197
00:11:30,847 --> 00:11:32,531
Let's just do mook-jji-ppa instead, please!

198
00:11:33,158 --> 00:11:35,834
[The most entertaining moment
we've seen in rock, paper, scissors.]

199
00:11:37,136 --> 00:11:38,540
Rock, paper, scissors!

200
00:11:39,868 --> 00:11:43,380
[Hello, Toad Kwang.]

201
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:53,443
Toad Kwang made his comeback.

202
00:11:59,699 --> 00:12:00,957
[Right around the same time...]

203
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:08,273
[The first victim of the flying chair
has been dragged out of the building.]

204
00:12:08,274 --> 00:12:10,145
What's going on here?

205
00:12:11,383 --> 00:12:13,586
What is that?
It's not like we're at a club or something.

206
00:12:18,521 --> 00:12:20,389
What's this?
14357?

207
00:12:20,723 --> 00:12:22,713
- Make sure to memorize it.
- This number?

208
00:12:26,506 --> 00:12:27,838
What is this?

209
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:30,107
What's 14357?

210
00:12:32,687 --> 00:12:34,317
What's the meaning of this number?

211
00:12:34,318 --> 00:12:37,077
[What's the hidden mystery
behind these numbers?]

212
00:12:37,078 --> 00:12:39,145
Make sure to memorize those numbers.

213
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:43,415
Your mission today
revolves around those numbers.

214
00:12:43,416 --> 00:12:46,765
[Their mission for the day is
related to those mysterious numbers.]

215
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:53,779
[The five digit number that is
surrounded in a cloud of mystery.]

216
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:57,076
[Their path starts with these numbers.]

217
00:12:58,109 --> 00:13:01,805
Do you see the doors in front of you
that are marked with the numbers 1,4,3,5,7?

218
00:13:07,196 --> 00:13:11,961
Pick one of those numbers, and
go wait behind the door of your choosing.

219
00:13:12,685 --> 00:13:13,915
Go.

220
00:13:13,916 --> 00:13:16,261
What could these numbers mean?
14357?

221
00:13:16,262 --> 00:13:19,175
[Pick one of the numbers,
and wait behind the door.]

222
00:13:19,176 --> 00:13:21,392
Do I just pick whichever one I want?

223
00:13:21,859 --> 00:13:23,487
You have to think carefully
about your selection.

224
00:13:23,488 --> 00:13:26,911
[What is the meaning behind those doors?
Must be chosen with caution?]

225
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:32,845
[Jong Kook chooses door number five.]

226
00:13:34,331 --> 00:13:35,585
I...

227
00:13:36,939 --> 00:13:38,133
I choose number three.

228
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:41,563
[Ji Hyo chooses door number three.]

229
00:13:46,129 --> 00:13:47,383
What is this?

230
00:13:49,653 --> 00:13:50,940
Is this how our teams are chosen?

231
00:13:51,134 --> 00:13:54,122
[Items necessary to carry out their missions
are found in each room?]

232
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:02,854
No matter how many times I come on this
show, I still can't seem to figure it out.

233
00:14:04,069 --> 00:14:05,891
Rock, paper, scissors!

234
00:14:09,275 --> 00:14:12,023
[Hye Jin is in the midst of experiencing the
flying chair for the first time in her life.]

235
00:14:14,482 --> 00:14:15,910
Are you okay, Hye Jin?

236
00:14:17,629 --> 00:14:20,244
[Frozen as ice.]

237
00:14:21,627 --> 00:14:23,721
- Hye Jin, are you okay?
- Is he the lifeguard?

238
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:26,895
She's back.
She's back after being dumped in the water.

239
00:14:26,896 --> 00:14:29,553
[The old fearless Hye Jin makes her
comeback after getting dunked in the water.]

240
00:14:30,496 --> 00:14:35,636
This is seriously driving me crazy.
Why is Suk Jin on such a winning streak?

241
00:14:35,637 --> 00:14:37,565
I'm going to do this today.

242
00:14:37,566 --> 00:14:39,541
- Let's do this!
- Let's end this!

243
00:14:39,542 --> 00:14:42,697
[Will it be Suk Jin with this
feisty spirit of late...]

244
00:14:42,698 --> 00:14:45,631
[Or will it be Ha Ha,
who just needs a win?]

245
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:48,926
Let's do this!

246
00:14:48,927 --> 00:14:50,782
Rock, paper, scissors!

247
00:14:51,656 --> 00:14:53,505
- What is it?
- What?

248
00:14:53,506 --> 00:14:55,582
- It's a draw.
- What the heck!

249
00:14:56,394 --> 00:14:59,203
[Their hearts are about to drop
from the level of anticipation and anxiety.]

250
00:15:00,047 --> 00:15:02,195
I'm going to throw out the 'rock' again.

251
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,008
I shouldn't have said anything!
I'm just confusing myself!

252
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:08,285
Take it back.
I'm taking it back.

253
00:15:08,286 --> 00:15:09,350
[Starting to show some strange behaviors
from extremely high level of anxiety.]

254
00:15:09,811 --> 00:15:11,862
What are you doing there by yourself?

255
00:15:12,929 --> 00:15:15,819
Rock, paper, scissors!

256
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:19,611
[Biting down... with all their might.]

257
00:15:20,825 --> 00:15:22,991
[Another draw!]

258
00:15:23,523 --> 00:15:27,002
- I really hate this!
- Just send one of us flying already.

259
00:15:27,003 --> 00:15:28,852
I don't even care if I win anymore.

260
00:15:30,201 --> 00:15:34,118
[The winning of the Flying Chair game will be
given an unbelievable advantage to the race.]

261
00:15:36,061 --> 00:15:39,099
[Let's really finish this right now!]

262
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:41,836
Rock, paper, scissors!

263
00:15:49,706 --> 00:15:53,860
[Number ten, Haroro is the ultimate winner!]

264
00:15:53,861 --> 00:15:55,383
I did it!

265
00:15:55,384 --> 00:15:57,594
I won!

266
00:16:01,728 --> 00:16:04,419
- Thank you.
- You are going to be given an amazing hint.

267
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:07,799
I have never seen my coordinator
looking so happy before.

268
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,984
Come here, Sung Chan!
Come on!

269
00:16:10,985 --> 00:16:14,033
[An emotional hug with his coordinator
over his unexpected win.]

270
00:16:14,883 --> 00:16:17,999
Ha Ha, you can go off to the dressing room
on your own without an escort.

271
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,662
Yes, I understand.
Thank you.

272
00:16:21,258 --> 00:16:23,305
[Rendered speechless from his excitement.]

273
00:16:25,725 --> 00:16:27,701
Why are we being
dragged around like this all day?

274
00:16:28,255 --> 00:16:30,658
[Meanwhile, Kwang Soo like others
is being dragged away...]

275
00:16:38,293 --> 00:16:41,233
[There he goes again...]

276
00:16:48,702 --> 00:16:49,862
Kwang Soo.

277
00:16:50,381 --> 00:16:52,166
- You chose number four?
- Yes.

278
00:16:52,167 --> 00:16:54,034
- Why don't you come in?
- What's going on here?

279
00:16:54,035 --> 00:16:55,982
[Kwang Soo and Seung Gi in
the same room.]

280
00:16:55,983 --> 00:16:57,205
What is all this?

281
00:16:57,912 --> 00:16:59,326
- I don't know either.
- What are we supposed to do with this?

282
00:16:59,327 --> 00:17:01,731
- You should know better than I.
- I don't really know either.

283
00:17:01,732 --> 00:17:04,014
What is all this on the table?

284
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,378
[Since there are two of each item,
it's probably two people per team?]

285
00:17:07,379 --> 00:17:09,516
Why are you acting all secretive?
Did I catch you doing something?

286
00:17:09,517 --> 00:17:10,962
No, it's not like that.

287
00:17:10,963 --> 00:17:13,062
- Did you get stamped too?
- Yes, I got stamped with the same numbers.

288
00:17:13,063 --> 00:17:16,536
[Just what is the meaning behind the numbers
14357 that are stamped on their hands?]

289
00:17:16,537 --> 00:17:18,328
I don't even try to know anymore.

290
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:20,202
- Is it money?
- Yes.

291
00:17:20,203 --> 00:17:21,583
It's 20,000 won.

292
00:17:21,584 --> 00:17:24,028
- Isn't that quite a bit?
- 20,000 is quite a bit for them to give us.

293
00:17:24,029 --> 00:17:26,105
Do we need to go somewhere far
or something?

294
00:17:26,106 --> 00:17:28,515
- With 20,000?
- You don't think?

295
00:17:28,841 --> 00:17:30,394
Since one of us has to be
the leader of this team

296
00:17:30,395 --> 00:17:31,538
how about since I'm the
older one here...

297
00:17:31,539 --> 00:17:33,342
Of course, you should be the leader.

298
00:17:33,394 --> 00:17:36,082
I felt like you were being really
rude to me earlier.

299
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:37,544
- The way you treated me...
- Are you kidding?

300
00:17:37,545 --> 00:17:38,737
No, I wasn't being rude to you.

301
00:17:38,738 --> 00:17:41,861
I was just saying that you're not
so easy to trust sometimes.

302
00:17:41,862 --> 00:17:43,539
- Kwang Soo.
- What is all this anyways?

303
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:45,540
Why are they dragging us around
everywhere?

304
00:17:45,541 --> 00:17:48,506
14... I think we should both memorize this
just in case it gets wiped off.

305
00:17:48,507 --> 00:17:50,033
14357.

306
00:17:51,115 --> 00:17:53,021
All these rooms look like
they're all taken already.

307
00:17:53,022 --> 00:17:54,961
[It's time for Bora to
make her selection now.]

308
00:17:54,962 --> 00:17:57,531
Since my name is Bora,
I'm going to go with purple.

309
00:17:58,259 --> 00:17:59,562
Bye!

310
00:18:01,351 --> 00:18:02,595
What is this?

311
00:18:10,817 --> 00:18:12,855
Hurry up and come in since
you've already made your choice.

312
00:18:12,856 --> 00:18:15,311
- What just happened?
- I was so startled.

313
00:18:15,312 --> 00:18:16,563
- Were you started?
- Yes, I was.

314
00:18:16,564 --> 00:18:19,247
I had no idea that someone
would be hiding in the corner.

315
00:18:19,248 --> 00:18:22,078
I can't believe it's Bora.
I really must have something with Sistar.

316
00:18:22,593 --> 00:18:25,113
[Following the Star of Idols episode,
he's teamed up with Sistar again.]

317
00:18:26,126 --> 00:18:29,727
[Fifth member of Sistar,
Voluptuous Muscle Boy.]

318
00:18:30,718 --> 00:18:33,388
[New housewife Hye Jin starting off by
checking the money in the envelop first.]

319
00:18:33,389 --> 00:18:35,585
Don't you think that
this amount is too little?

320
00:18:35,727 --> 00:18:37,676
Wow... look at this.

321
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:39,843
This one.

322
00:18:39,844 --> 00:18:41,835
[Jae Suk picks door number one.]

323
00:18:41,836 --> 00:18:44,941
[Inside, he finds Hye Jin!]

324
00:18:47,283 --> 00:18:49,609
- Good luck with the mission.
- The victory will be ours.

325
00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:51,683
Hye Jin's really good at doing
the missions.

326
00:18:51,684 --> 00:18:54,195
[The goddess of competitiveness,
Madame Han.]

327
00:18:54,196 --> 00:18:55,371
Hye Jin's competitive streak is no joke.

328
00:18:55,406 --> 00:18:57,503
- I won the last time.
- You did?

329
00:19:00,257 --> 00:19:02,146
I'm going to go with the pink door.
Pink.

330
00:19:05,982 --> 00:19:07,518
Ugh, you startled me!

331
00:19:07,519 --> 00:19:09,184
You really startled me!

332
00:19:09,185 --> 00:19:10,324
It's you again?

333
00:19:10,324 --> 00:19:12,067
[Unbelievable...
Monday Couple is teamed up again.]

334
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:13,693
- Why did you choose this door?
- What is this?

335
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:16,220
Since I came in at first place,
should I choose door number one?

336
00:19:16,907 --> 00:19:18,420
Or should I pick lucky number seven?

337
00:19:19,356 --> 00:19:20,863
Since I came in at first place...

338
00:19:20,864 --> 00:19:22,640
I'm going to go with door number one.

339
00:19:25,328 --> 00:19:26,616
Hello!

340
00:19:28,025 --> 00:19:31,903
[Two people per team-
But all the other rooms are already filled.]

341
00:19:34,792 --> 00:19:36,092
<i>What is this?</i>

342
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:40,306
[First place winner, Haroro keeps on being
refused admittance to all the rooms.]

343
00:19:41,944 --> 00:19:44,428
- Lucky number seven!
- Come in.

344
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,321
- Wait.
- Hey!

345
00:19:48,322 --> 00:19:50,003
- What is this!
- Come in!

346
00:19:50,703 --> 00:19:52,455
This is the only spot left available.

347
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:55,483
Hey, I just got done experiencing
the same thing that you did.

348
00:19:55,484 --> 00:19:56,549
This is the only room left.

349
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:58,090
- Today?
- Today is the day.

350
00:19:59,341 --> 00:20:02,728
[Now that they think about it, they're the
1st and 2nd winners of flying chair game.]

351
00:20:02,729 --> 00:20:04,106
- Seriously!
- Okay.

352
00:20:04,107 --> 00:20:08,048
<i>Has everyone finished equipping yourselves
with the items that you have been given?</i>

353
00:20:08,049 --> 00:20:09,113
[All the teams have been now chosen.]

354
00:20:09,114 --> 00:20:10,979
<i> Here is today's race.</i>

355
00:20:11,856 --> 00:20:14,003
<i>Today's race is, The Number.</i>

356
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:16,955
[The Number Race.]

357
00:20:16,956 --> 00:20:22,509
<i>You may start off to your next location with
the number you've been given and a keyword.</i>

358
00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:26,109
<i>Once you succeed the mission that
you're given at each location...</i>

359
00:20:26,537 --> 00:20:29,010
<i>you will be given the keyword
for the next location.</i>

360
00:20:29,011 --> 00:20:31,751
- Really?
- You have to complete the mission...

361
00:20:31,752 --> 00:20:35,883
to get to the final location
as quickly as you can.

362
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:40,011
<i>The member who came in at first place
during the Flying Chair Game...</i>

363
00:20:40,715 --> 00:20:42,533
<i>and also the member who came in
at second place...</i>

364
00:20:43,354 --> 00:20:47,063
<i>Up to the third place winner
will be given a special hint.</i>

365
00:20:47,064 --> 00:20:50,571
[Special hints to be given out to
Ha Ha, Suk Jin and Gary.]

366
00:20:50,572 --> 00:20:54,688
[The keyword to help them find
their way to the first location.]

367
00:20:55,586 --> 00:20:57,509
This is so disappointing.

368
00:20:57,510 --> 00:21:00,787
You don't have any hints for people who
went first, second or third?

369
00:21:00,891 --> 00:21:03,524
- Nothing for fifth place winner?
- No, nothing.

370
00:21:03,525 --> 00:21:09,168
You may now try to deduct your guess,
and find your way to the next location.

371
00:21:09,169 --> 00:21:10,652
14357?

372
00:21:12,775 --> 00:21:14,852
[What is the third place winner hint
that Gary and Ji Hyo have been given?]

373
00:21:14,853 --> 00:21:18,546
[Bus]

374
00:21:19,379 --> 00:21:21,707
[Bus?]

375
00:21:22,532 --> 00:21:25,194
Could it be a bus number?
All the buses are numbered.

376
00:21:27,518 --> 00:21:30,396
- Bus station?
- Is that what yours says?

377
00:21:30,397 --> 00:21:32,988
[Second winner hint- Station.]

378
00:21:32,989 --> 00:21:36,139
[First winner hint- Bus station.]

379
00:21:37,149 --> 00:21:40,383
- This is the best hint.
- All we needed was your hint.

380
00:21:40,384 --> 00:21:44,254
[Prime hint- It seems as though 'Bus Station'
is the only hint they need!]

381
00:21:45,018 --> 00:21:46,357
Let's go.

382
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:49,832
[Suk Jin and Ha Ha are on their way
with their hints!]

383
00:21:50,483 --> 00:21:56,367
[14357... and Bus Station?]

384
00:21:56,368 --> 00:21:58,703
Suk Jin... let's just sneak away
right now.

385
00:21:58,704 --> 00:22:00,935
Let's just sneak away before
anyone notices.

386
00:22:01,123 --> 00:22:04,366
[Married Men-Cross!
Sneaking away in the midst of confusion.]

387
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:07,502
- Bus station.
- Is that what you have too?

388
00:22:07,503 --> 00:22:10,628
[An extreme advantage over all the others
with the hints that they've been given.]

389
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:15,338
- If others notices that we're leaving...
- What if they try to take it away from us?

390
00:22:18,113 --> 00:22:20,178
- That team is leaving.
- They're leaving? Then let's go too.

391
00:22:21,351 --> 00:22:24,236
[Jong Kook and Bora are trying to
follow in their trail.]

392
00:22:25,202 --> 00:22:27,490
Is Running Man changing their theme
to using their brains now?

393
00:22:27,491 --> 00:22:29,120
No, not at all.

394
00:22:30,888 --> 00:22:34,526
- 14357 is the hint to the next location?
- That number sounds so familiar to me.

395
00:22:34,527 --> 00:22:36,156
- I know.
- Me too. That number sounds familiar to me.

396
00:22:36,157 --> 00:22:38,509
[The number sounds familiar to them?]

397
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:42,955
Isn't 14357 the number to our
Foreign Cultural Administration?

398
00:22:43,408 --> 00:22:46,082
- I don't know if it is or not.
- There you go acting all smart again.

399
00:22:46,894 --> 00:22:49,143
Where are you getting the
Foreign Cultural Administration from?

400
00:22:50,098 --> 00:22:53,841
[Gary and Ji Hyo head off to the bus station
with the hint that they've been given.]

401
00:22:57,530 --> 00:23:00,822
- What could it be?
- Where did everyone go? Ugh, it's so cold.

402
00:23:02,215 --> 00:23:04,050
- Bus?
- Could it be a bus?

403
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:10,023
[Bus number, 14357?]

404
00:23:10,832 --> 00:23:14,116
[Carefully scanning the bus directory list.]

405
00:23:22,001 --> 00:23:25,216
[Why do things like this keep
on happening to them?]

406
00:23:26,202 --> 00:23:29,249
Why do you mean, skills? What skills are
required in rock, paper, scissors?

407
00:23:31,204 --> 00:23:32,699
We have to be careful.

408
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:34,513
[Run!]

409
00:23:35,421 --> 00:23:37,429
[But the couple on the chase seems
to be full of ease.]

410
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,770
[Immediately flags down an empty cab.]

411
00:23:42,445 --> 00:23:44,469
- Can you turn around?
- Yes, please turn around.

412
00:23:46,569 --> 00:23:49,226
- Can you follow that taxi?
- We have to follow that car.

413
00:23:50,081 --> 00:23:52,482
What could 14357 mean?

414
00:23:52,886 --> 00:23:55,591
That's the car up ahead.
Just follow that cab.

415
00:23:55,592 --> 00:23:57,471
You have to stay right on their tail.

416
00:23:57,472 --> 00:24:02,145
[Meanwhile, these two couples are walking
around aimlessly without a single hint.]

417
00:24:02,146 --> 00:24:04,480
But seeing how we were given
the bus card...

418
00:24:05,921 --> 00:24:09,740
[Now that they think about it, the bus card
was given out with their money...]

419
00:24:11,301 --> 00:24:13,433
I think it's a bus number.

420
00:24:13,434 --> 00:24:14,946
- It's a bus number.
- You think?

421
00:24:15,756 --> 00:24:19,643
[Anyone see a bus numbered 14357?]

422
00:24:20,699 --> 00:24:22,698
I doubt it's that simple.

423
00:24:22,699 --> 00:24:27,282
- Does it mean take bus 14 three times?
- Maybe it's bus number 143?

424
00:24:27,283 --> 00:24:30,793
[Zero hint group thinking of
everything they can think of.]

425
00:24:32,326 --> 00:24:34,549
We have to put our heads together since
none of us know anything.

426
00:24:35,487 --> 00:24:37,677
I feel like my mind goes blank
whenever I come on Running Man.

427
00:24:37,678 --> 00:24:39,359
My mind just stops working.

428
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:42,059
We're always doing these tough missions
whenever Seung Gi comes on the show.

429
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:44,685
- It's always a mystery.
- Seriously.

430
00:24:46,267 --> 00:24:47,869
14357.

431
00:24:48,723 --> 00:24:51,445
- Should we go ask the city office?
- Should we?

432
00:24:51,446 --> 00:24:53,654
Whether or not there's a bus
with that number?

433
00:24:53,655 --> 00:24:55,892
- The office is right there.
- What?

434
00:24:55,893 --> 00:24:57,852
The office is right here.

435
00:24:58,626 --> 00:25:00,954
- Is this the city office?
- Is that what they said?

436
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,635
- You're from Yongsan, right?
- Yes.

437
00:25:02,636 --> 00:25:04,605
Then you can't go inside the
Mapo City office.

438
00:25:05,495 --> 00:25:07,983
Do you think...
you think they'd be that petty?

439
00:25:10,162 --> 00:25:11,333
<i>Excuse me.</i>

440
00:25:11,334 --> 00:25:14,242
I'm sorry, but is there an office where we
can find out different bus numbers?

441
00:25:15,092 --> 00:25:18,593
- Yes, we can look it up.
- Can you look it up on the internet for us?

442
00:25:18,594 --> 00:25:20,501
- 14357.
- We can't, but they can look it up, right?

443
00:25:20,502 --> 00:25:23,489
[Rule- Even though they can't look it up
themselves, they are allowed to ask for help.]

444
00:25:25,212 --> 00:25:27,270
[What would searching '14357' result in?]

445
00:25:27,271 --> 00:25:29,741
[Something seemed to have popped up?]

446
00:25:29,742 --> 00:25:33,595
- I think it's a bus station number.
- Bus station in Sangam-dong?

447
00:25:50,346 --> 00:25:53,374
[The mystery behind 14357...]

448
00:25:53,375 --> 00:25:57,113
[The number to a bus station?]

449
00:25:57,114 --> 00:25:59,546
- Maybe it's the bus station we were by?
- It's the bus station in Sangam-dong!

450
00:25:59,838 --> 00:26:01,730
Come take a look, Hye Jin.

451
00:26:03,026 --> 00:26:05,052
[As guessed, they make a run for it!]

452
00:26:05,626 --> 00:26:07,111
Thank you!

453
00:26:09,974 --> 00:26:11,222
Excuse me!

454
00:26:12,074 --> 00:26:15,735
[14357 is the public bus station
in Sangam-dong?]

455
00:26:15,736 --> 00:26:17,544
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure! Want to take the cab?

456
00:26:17,545 --> 00:26:18,568
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure!

457
00:26:18,569 --> 00:26:20,633
Can I ask you something?

458
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:23,977
- Where's Sangam-dong bus station?
- You're asking everyone in sight?

459
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:26,477
- You have to go that way.
- That way?

460
00:26:26,478 --> 00:26:29,049
[Asking nearby pedestrians where
the bus station is located.]

461
00:26:29,050 --> 00:26:30,769
They're already going!

462
00:26:31,566 --> 00:26:32,879
- Thank you!
- Run!

463
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:37,267
[It's quite the distance...]

464
00:26:37,268 --> 00:26:39,260
You know how to work those women.

465
00:26:40,375 --> 00:26:42,789
[Could it be from his most recent trips
with older women?]

466
00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:44,894
- They cussed me out the whole time.
- Seriously?

467
00:26:46,156 --> 00:26:48,454
Jae Suk, I thought you said it was
Foreign something or other?

468
00:26:49,239 --> 00:26:53,185
[Yoo Hyuk's know-it-all personality becoming
a subject of laughter for the new bride.]

469
00:26:53,483 --> 00:26:55,427
I thought you said it was
the Cultural Heritage something.

470
00:26:55,428 --> 00:26:58,717
I thought it was the number of some cultural
artifact item that we needed to recover.

471
00:26:58,718 --> 00:27:03,134
[That's 74434...]

472
00:27:03,565 --> 00:27:06,018
- I think we have to cross over.
- How do we get to the other side?

473
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:07,975
There's goes Seung Gi with
his questions again.

474
00:27:09,464 --> 00:27:11,704
- Yes, thank you.
- Why are you asking so many questions?

475
00:27:13,478 --> 00:27:15,841
- Didn't I tell you that I was the leader?
- Huh?

476
00:27:15,842 --> 00:27:18,001
[It seems to be reversed.
Team member Seung Gi leading Leader Kwang.]

477
00:27:18,002 --> 00:27:20,222
If you have a question,
then just come to me and ask.

478
00:27:20,223 --> 00:27:25,580
The subordinate has to bring
the leader useful information

479
00:27:25,581 --> 00:27:27,054
and you can make the final decisions.

480
00:27:27,055 --> 00:27:30,658
- Where's Sangam-dong bus station?
- Sangam-dong Center?

481
00:27:30,659 --> 00:27:34,408
- No, the bus station.
- Oh, that's over that way.

482
00:27:34,409 --> 00:27:35,702
Thank you.

483
00:27:35,703 --> 00:27:37,375
- Make sure to keep this in mind.
- Okay.

484
00:27:38,589 --> 00:27:41,584
You have to tell me everything and
get my approval before you do anything.

485
00:27:41,585 --> 00:27:44,305
- That's going to take too long.
- What?

486
00:27:44,306 --> 00:27:46,600
Then why... then why am I even the leader?

487
00:27:46,601 --> 00:27:48,837
You're the one doing everything,
and I'm just following you.

488
00:27:48,838 --> 00:27:51,879
You're the leader of this team.
Have you ever seen the captain out in front?

489
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,511
The captain always stays behind his men.

490
00:27:53,512 --> 00:27:55,849
I'm going to ask one other person where
the station is. Hang on a minute.

491
00:27:55,850 --> 00:27:57,825
[Questioner Seung Gi off to ask
someone else.]

492
00:27:57,826 --> 00:27:59,793
I told you to consult with me
before you go off, didn't I?

493
00:28:01,714 --> 00:28:03,557
Wow, you're so good looking.

494
00:28:05,783 --> 00:28:07,463
Why do you act like they were
only talking to you

495
00:28:07,463 --> 00:28:09,027
when they were saying handsome?

496
00:28:09,028 --> 00:28:11,690
Weren't they speaking to both of us?

497
00:28:12,387 --> 00:28:16,421
- They could've just been talking to me.
- Yes, you're right.

498
00:28:17,174 --> 00:28:20,502
[Gary and Ji Hyo are still mindlessly
staring at the bus terminal directory.]

499
00:28:23,025 --> 00:28:25,359
[Wait... those numbers...]

500
00:28:26,598 --> 00:28:28,744
Look at the bus station number.
It starts off with a 14.

501
00:28:28,745 --> 00:28:30,245
[The bus station number starts off with 14!]

502
00:28:32,022 --> 00:28:35,011
Then that means we need to find a
bus station with the number, 14357.

503
00:28:35,641 --> 00:28:37,902
Should we call the office of transportation?

504
00:28:39,004 --> 00:28:45,250
Yes, we're in front of the World Cup Stadium,
and we need to get to station number 14357.

505
00:28:46,948 --> 00:28:50,206
- That team just needs to follow us.
- I know, it's so annoying.

506
00:28:50,586 --> 00:28:52,285
It's so annoying.

507
00:28:55,012 --> 00:28:57,889
[Taking a close look at the bus terminal
numbers as the hint indicates...]

508
00:28:57,890 --> 00:29:01,313
[Easily able to depict that the hint, 14357
is the number to a bus station!]

509
00:29:01,314 --> 00:29:03,177
- We have to go to 14357.
- We need to get to 14357.

510
00:29:03,178 --> 00:29:06,011
- 14357. We need to check all the stations.
- Please take us there.

511
00:29:06,824 --> 00:29:09,899
- 14... that's 146.
- We need to keep going.

512
00:29:11,913 --> 00:29:15,445
We need to find 14357, but that's 14164.

513
00:29:15,863 --> 00:29:19,896
[14357 has to be around here somewhere...]

514
00:29:20,452 --> 00:29:23,204
How about... we call Dasan Call Center?

515
00:29:23,452 --> 00:29:26,817
- We can try calling them.
- They can tell us anything.

516
00:29:27,323 --> 00:29:32,919
- Yes, we're in Sangam-dong right now.
- Is that... 14344?

517
00:29:33,284 --> 00:29:35,842
Yes, I was inquiring about the bus stations.

518
00:29:36,366 --> 00:29:42,609
What do the numbers 14-357
stand for at a bus station?

519
00:29:45,162 --> 00:29:47,616
That's the Sangam-dong
Community Bus Center ID?

520
00:29:51,237 --> 00:29:54,163
[When all the hints 14357, bus, station
are put together...]

521
00:29:57,065 --> 00:30:00,772
[It stands for Sangam-dong
Community Bus Center ID!]

522
00:30:05,034 --> 00:30:08,492
[The two weakest couples of the group are
still searching for Sangam-dong Bus Center.]

523
00:30:08,493 --> 00:30:10,168
- Gary!
- This isn't it.

524
00:30:10,169 --> 00:30:11,296
What's that?

525
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:13,486
Why are you standing there?

526
00:30:13,487 --> 00:30:15,986
Ji Hyo and I were just
taking a break and talking.

527
00:30:16,594 --> 00:30:18,497
- Who were you talking to?
- Just a friend.

528
00:30:18,944 --> 00:30:21,932
[Gary trying to lie about having been on
the phone with the Office of Transportation.]

529
00:30:22,522 --> 00:30:24,306
- What are you guys doing here?
- Nothing.

530
00:30:26,206 --> 00:30:28,059
They said they're going to
call us back.

531
00:30:29,990 --> 00:30:31,504
Yeah, they're going to call us back.

532
00:30:31,505 --> 00:30:33,681
- Where are we supposed to go?
- We don't know either.

533
00:30:33,682 --> 00:30:35,125
[Leader Kwang questioning Gary and Ji Hyo
who was given a hint to the location.]

534
00:30:35,126 --> 00:30:37,494
- We seriously don't know.
- You still haven't figured out 14357?

535
00:30:37,495 --> 00:30:38,983
- No.
- We don't know.

536
00:30:38,984 --> 00:30:40,242
What is that?
You got a call.

537
00:30:40,243 --> 00:30:42,420
What are you doing, Leader Kwang?

538
00:30:42,421 --> 00:30:45,018
[Team member Seung Gi coming around
to urge on his Leader Kwang.]

539
00:30:45,547 --> 00:30:48,326
What are you doing?
Are you a minion or a leader?

540
00:30:48,327 --> 00:30:49,998
What do you mean, a minion?

541
00:30:49,999 --> 00:30:53,194
Thank you. Then can we
take the bus from this station?

542
00:30:55,603 --> 00:30:57,578
Yes, thank you.

543
00:30:58,485 --> 00:31:01,419
- What did they say?
- Sangam-dong Community Bus Center.

544
00:31:04,487 --> 00:31:08,099
[Having figured out where to go from
having called the Office of Transportation.]

545
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:10,086
Does this bus go to
Sangam-dong Community Bus Center?

546
00:31:11,163 --> 00:31:13,943
- Are they leaving?
- No, we're trying to see what we can find.

547
00:31:13,944 --> 00:31:15,557
[Monday Couple getting on the bus and
trying to thwart the other team.]

548
00:31:15,558 --> 00:31:17,377
We don't know what's going on,
so let's just try to figure it out first.

549
00:31:17,378 --> 00:31:20,617
[Clueless Kwang Soo and Seung Gi
are unsure of what they should do.]

550
00:31:30,246 --> 00:31:33,507
[Sangam-dong Community
Bus Center- Bus station.]

551
00:31:34,388 --> 00:31:36,117
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

552
00:31:36,118 --> 00:31:39,007
[Could this be the scene of
the mysterious 14357?]

553
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:45,089
- Do I just swipe it here?
- Yes, you're all set.

554
00:31:45,559 --> 00:31:48,634
- Our plan succeeded, Bora.
- Jong Kook.

555
00:31:48,635 --> 00:31:50,862
- Let's seriously work together to the end.
- Yes, that's what we'll have to do.

556
00:31:50,863 --> 00:31:53,299
- Let's work together.
- Until we're the last two teams standing.

557
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:55,717
You still don't know for sure where
we're supposed to go, right?

558
00:31:57,112 --> 00:31:58,540
Where is it?

559
00:32:00,517 --> 00:32:02,943
[There it is!]

560
00:32:03,493 --> 00:32:06,570
[This must be the place!
There's the mission envelope!]

561
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:09,688
- What's the hint?
- We don't know it yet either.

562
00:32:11,598 --> 00:32:14,489
- Everyone grab one.
- What's the hint?

563
00:32:14,490 --> 00:32:16,177
We have to figure this out.

564
00:32:16,178 --> 00:32:20,353
[They joined alliances just a moment ago,
but they're already suspecting each other.]

565
00:32:20,554 --> 00:32:23,640
- What does 14357 stand for?
- That's the number of the bus station.

566
00:32:23,641 --> 00:32:27,225
- Look here. 14357.
- You can see the number 14357 right here.

567
00:32:27,226 --> 00:32:29,433
- There's a dash.
- I do see the dash now.

568
00:32:29,949 --> 00:32:33,803
[They found it!]

569
00:32:34,657 --> 00:32:37,399
- They're all the same, right?
- I think all the hints are the same.

570
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:41,292
[First keyword- Plus 11.]

571
00:32:41,850 --> 00:32:46,458
[What does the keyword, plus 11 mean?]

572
00:32:46,459 --> 00:32:49,249
- How do we find out?
- There's another way of finding out.

573
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:51,426
- Want to pay for our cab?
- You'll tell us in the cab?

574
00:32:51,427 --> 00:32:52,973
- Are you going to pay for our cab?
- Okay, we'll pay it.

575
00:32:52,974 --> 00:32:55,141
- Okay, deal.
- You'll pay for our taxi?

576
00:32:55,503 --> 00:32:59,754
- You're dead if it turns out to be nothing.
- What do you mean, nothing?

577
00:32:59,755 --> 00:33:01,140
[What could 'plus 11' mean?]

578
00:33:01,141 --> 00:33:03,998
[Could it be that plus 11 means 14-368?]

579
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:07,992
This is unbelievable.
He's getting a free ride.

580
00:33:07,993 --> 00:33:10,682
Seriously... this is really unfair to us.

581
00:33:11,108 --> 00:33:12,816
Yes, hello.

582
00:33:13,719 --> 00:33:17,934
14-368... Can you tell us where that is?

583
00:33:20,481 --> 00:33:21,920
It doesn't exist?

584
00:33:22,615 --> 00:33:25,175
[A dead-end.]

585
00:33:25,874 --> 00:33:31,028
Then... how about 25-357?
Where's 25-357?

586
00:33:31,029 --> 00:33:34,666
- 25 dash 357.
- Yes, does 25-357 exist?

587
00:33:36,183 --> 00:33:38,388
- It's in Kangdong-gu?
- Kangdong-gu?

588
00:33:38,389 --> 00:33:40,633
25-357 is Kangdong-gu?

589
00:33:41,104 --> 00:33:44,307
[If it's Kangdong-gu...]

590
00:33:44,308 --> 00:33:48,290
[It's 30km away in the opposite direction.]

591
00:33:48,881 --> 00:33:53,348
[How are they going to get themselves
out of this impasse?]

592
00:33:54,279 --> 00:33:56,344
Hey, this is 14-980.

593
00:33:56,345 --> 00:33:59,563
[Jae Suk and Hye Jin having gotten lost
on their way to the mission location.]

594
00:33:59,564 --> 00:34:01,152
Can you tell us where Sangam Bus Center is?

595
00:34:01,153 --> 00:34:02,697
It's across the street from
the elementary school.

596
00:34:02,698 --> 00:34:04,758
Ah, across the street from
the elementary school?

597
00:34:05,068 --> 00:34:07,121
- It's too far to walk, right?
- Yes, it's far.

598
00:34:07,122 --> 00:34:10,927
If we were to get in right now,
would you be able to take us there?

599
00:34:10,928 --> 00:34:13,465
- You have to go across the street.
- Across the street? Okay.

600
00:34:14,165 --> 00:34:17,131
[It seems to be in the opposite direction.]

601
00:34:19,094 --> 00:34:24,222
You didn't even ask if he could take us,
but you asked if he'd turn the car around.

602
00:34:24,223 --> 00:34:26,596
Then he replies back by telling you
to go across the street.

603
00:34:26,597 --> 00:34:28,843
[Cool enough to tell them to go
across the street.]

604
00:34:28,844 --> 00:34:31,335
I thought that he'd give us
a ride for sure.

605

[Monday Couple also having gotten lost
on their way to the station.]

606

Thank you.

607

- Are you not going to buy any oranges, Gary?
- You want some?

608
00:34:43,868 --> 00:34:47,405
Can we have 13 of those oranges?

609
00:34:47,406 --> 00:34:48,920
[Busy buying delicious looking oranges.]

610
00:34:48,921 --> 00:34:52,672
Since I'm a fan of Ji Hyo's...
I'll give you extra as a bonus.

[Giving Ji Hyo extra oranges
for being her fan.]

612

- Thank you.
- Thank you.

613
00:34:56,971 --> 00:34:59,611
- Just get married.
- Excuse me?

614
00:34:59,779 --> 00:35:02,292
[He seems to think that they make
a good looking couple.]

615
00:35:02,293 --> 00:35:04,367
That's what she wants right now.

616
00:35:05,368 --> 00:35:07,337
- Please stay healthy this winter.
- Thank you.

Some elder just told us to get married.

621
00:35:23,103 --> 00:35:25,084
But... oh, it's here!

622
00:35:25,085 --> 00:35:27,488
Where are you going?
Let's go together!

623

[Taking the taxi to go somewhere?]

624
00:35:30,147 --> 00:35:31,761

the urgency of the situation.]

We're paying Dutch next time, okay?

629
00:35:49,667 --> 00:35:51,375
I want some sweet fish bread.

630
00:35:53,775 --> 00:35:56,163
Want to get one?
Want to each get one?

631
00:35:57,023 --> 00:35:59,162
- Is it possible to get 1,000 won worth?
- 1,000 won worth?

632
00:35:59,163 --> 00:36:01,293
- It's just for the two of us.
- Thank you.

633

- I'll treat.
- Okay.

all the chill away.]

[But where's the Sangam Community Center?]

639
00:36:20,772 --> 00:36:22,093
What's this?

It's 14-286.

But our number is 14-357.

642

Look at what happened from me
having listened to you.

643
00:36:31,239 --> 00:36:33,206
You're the one who said we had to go
to the community center.

644

- I'm sorry, excuse me.

[Looking up the bus station location
with the number 14-357 once again.]

649
00:36:52,999 --> 00:36:56,172
- Thank you, we can't do that ourselves.
- It shows up as Sangam Community Center.

650
00:36:56,173 --> 00:36:57,966
[Giving away a sweet fish bread as
a token of their appreciation.]

651
00:36:59,242 --> 00:37:03,717
I'm the one who gave you the bread, but
you're giving all your attention to Seung Gi?

652
00:37:04,337 --> 00:37:05,838
- Where is it?
- I'm the one who gave you that bread.

653
00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:07,320
Hold on, Kwang Soo.

654
00:37:07,321 --> 00:37:09,821
- Did you just shush me?
- No.

655
00:37:10,296 --> 00:37:12,448
- It seems to be that way.
- Right? We have to go up a bit more?

656
00:37:12,449 --> 00:37:14,130
- No, is it that way?
- Yes, it's that way.

657
00:37:14,131 --> 00:37:16,868
That way, right?
Thank you so much.

658
00:37:16,869 --> 00:37:18,852
- That way?
- Yes, thank you.

659
00:37:18,853 --> 00:37:20,264
- Enjoy the sweet fish bread.
- Thank you.

660
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:23,426
Kwang Soo, that was the piece with
the most amount of red beans in it.

661
00:37:23,427 --> 00:37:24,606
- Really?
- Yes.

662
00:37:25,177 --> 00:37:26,800
Wait, sorry!

663
00:37:26,801 --> 00:37:28,154
[He's going back?]

664
00:37:28,530 --> 00:37:31,159
Can you break it off in half
and let us have a piece?

665
00:37:31,885 --> 00:37:34,674
Giving something away and taking it back
is the worst thing you can do!

666
00:37:35,330 --> 00:37:37,685
[Ultimately takes back half the bread
that he initially gave away himself.]

667
00:37:38,982 --> 00:37:40,745
- There really is a ton of red beans in this!
- Did you get half of it back?

668
00:37:41,234 --> 00:37:43,089
I just asked him to give me the tail half.

669
00:37:43,743 --> 00:37:46,753
I never knew that all the bus stations
had their own ID's.

670
00:37:47,332 --> 00:37:49,007
Me too.
This is my first time seeing it.

671
00:37:49,707 --> 00:37:50,911
Here it comes.

672
00:37:50,912 --> 00:37:52,824
There's Gary and Ji Hyo.

673
00:37:53,267 --> 00:37:55,360
- So we're not very late ourselves then.
- I think so.

674
00:37:55,361 --> 00:37:56,361
Too bad.

675
00:37:56,823 --> 00:37:58,363
- We're heading to the next mission?
- Seriously?

676
00:37:58,364 --> 00:38:01,295
Taking the bus made you late.
You should've taken a taxi.

677
00:38:01,296 --> 00:38:02,568
- Really?
- Yes.

678
00:38:02,569 --> 00:38:05,741
- We're okay.
- We don't worry about things like that.

679
00:38:05,742 --> 00:38:07,342
- Are you eating oranges?
- They stopped by for oranges?

680
00:38:07,343 --> 00:38:10,156
- We stopped by to have some oranges.
- It's over that way.

681
00:38:12,928 --> 00:38:15,523
[Starving Leader Kwang
going after the oranges.]

682
00:38:15,524 --> 00:38:18,897
- Where did you say it was?
- No, they haven't done the mission yet.

683
00:38:18,898 --> 00:38:20,283
What are you doing, Seung Gi?

684
00:38:23,871 --> 00:38:26,149
[What... what are they doing?]

685
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:27,777
What are you guys doing!

686
00:38:28,692 --> 00:38:30,303
What are you guys doing!

687
00:38:30,304 --> 00:38:32,852
- My hands were too dirty.
- After what you did with me last week?

688
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:36,084
- Why are you getting jealous over this?
- I don't know, but I'm jealous.

689
00:38:36,977 --> 00:38:38,356
This is the place.

690
00:38:40,351 --> 00:38:42,367
[Finally!]

691
00:38:43,905 --> 00:38:45,400
- What is it?
- This is it.

692
00:38:45,734 --> 00:38:46,979
What is this?

693
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:49,352
[Plus 11]

694
00:38:49,353 --> 00:38:50,904
- Do we add?
- 14357!

695
00:38:50,905 --> 00:38:54,385
68.
Then isn't it... 14-368?

696
00:38:54,386 --> 00:38:57,701
[As others before him,
his guess is 14-368.]

697
00:38:57,702 --> 00:38:59,475
- 68.
- Then is that where we go?

698
00:39:00,737 --> 00:39:02,748
- There it is!
- Jae Suk!

699
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:06,845
[Jae Suk and Hye Jin finally making their
way over to 14-357.]

700
00:39:09,623 --> 00:39:13,730
- I can't believe we all ran into each other.
- Why are our three teams constantly together?

701
00:39:15,153 --> 00:39:18,696
[Plus 11...]

702
00:39:18,984 --> 00:39:20,914
I don't know where to add
the number.

703
00:39:28,885 --> 00:39:30,654
Let's just get on that bus.

704
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:34,440
- We can just take another taxi then.
- Okay.

705
00:39:34,917 --> 00:39:38,801
[Their plan is to grab a taxi
whenever they feel lost.]

706
00:39:39,870 --> 00:39:43,376
[Hye Jin counting up the stations.]

707
00:39:43,377 --> 00:39:45,708
[Could it mean 11 stations away at
Chongkiwa Gas Station?]

708
00:39:45,709 --> 00:39:48,132
Excuse me, but can I ask you a question?

709
00:39:48,133 --> 00:39:50,954
We're trying to look up different
bus stations on the internet.

710
00:39:50,955 --> 00:39:53,092
Can you look it up on the internet for us?

711
00:39:54,405 --> 00:39:57,631
- I see a bus coming.
- 14-368.

712
00:39:57,632 --> 00:39:59,252
There's a bus coming.

713
00:40:00,353 --> 00:40:01,970
- Do you see it?
- No, it's not popping up.

714
00:40:01,971 --> 00:40:04,171
Then how about 25-357?

715
00:40:04,175 --> 00:40:05,866
- Does that not exist either?
- No.

716
00:40:05,867 --> 00:40:07,340
Then this must not be it.

717
00:40:07,876 --> 00:40:10,872
- Okay, thank you.
- Thank you!

718
00:40:10,873 --> 00:40:12,089
We should get on too.

719
00:40:12,090 --> 00:40:14,156
Excuse me, coming through.

720
00:40:15,621 --> 00:40:17,748
- Let's go to the eleventh station.
- Eleventh station?

721
00:40:18,276 --> 00:40:20,989
What are you guys doing here?

722
00:40:20,990 --> 00:40:24,216
[The two couples are back
together again.]

723
00:40:24,217 --> 00:40:26,529
Let me tell you why we're here.

724
00:40:26,530 --> 00:40:32,784
We got some help from others,
and we tried adding 11 to the ID.

725
00:40:32,785 --> 00:40:36,278
- But nothing turned up.
- Meaning it's not a bus station.

726
00:40:36,279 --> 00:40:39,207
Since we told you guys that,
why don't we work together now?

727
00:40:39,208 --> 00:40:42,037
We were going to go to the
eleventh station anyway.

728
00:40:42,038 --> 00:40:46,387
You guys seem to be doing this scientifically,
but we're going by our gut feeling.

729
00:40:46,388 --> 00:40:48,677
If we get somewhere and feel that it's wrong,
then we get on a taxi right away.

730
00:40:50,135 --> 00:40:53,002
If we get somewhere and feel that it's wrong,
then we get on a taxi right away.

731
00:40:53,002 --> 00:40:55,600
But whether it's scientific, or by gut,
we seem to be on the same path.

732
00:40:55,601 --> 00:41:01,110
But you know what's really fascinating?
We all move separately...

733
00:41:01,111 --> 00:41:04,471
We're all moving on our own, but how
do we always end up together again?

734
00:41:04,981 --> 00:41:07,421
I guess it means that we're all along
the same intelligence level.

735
00:41:07,422 --> 00:41:09,974
I guess none of us
are especially smart.

736
00:41:12,063 --> 00:41:13,833
- There it is!
- Where?

737
00:41:13,834 --> 00:41:16,586
- You can let us out here.
- There it is!

738
00:41:16,587 --> 00:41:19,061
[Chungkiwa gas station bus stop-
There's an 'R' box at the station!]

739
00:41:19,062 --> 00:41:21,804
[Ten minutes prior.]

740
00:41:21,805 --> 00:41:25,363
Is it eleventh from where
we're standing?

741
00:41:25,364 --> 00:41:28,964
[Jong Kook and Bora having added 11
from station 14-357.=

742
00:41:28,965 --> 00:41:30,788
Isn't that it?
Chungkiwa station?

743
00:41:30,789 --> 00:41:35,441
[Having decided to check out
Chungkiwa Station first.]

744
00:41:36,301 --> 00:41:38,655
- Chungkiwa Station.
- Why don't we start from there?

745
00:41:39,041 --> 00:41:40,493
Okay.

746
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:42,583
Let's go.

747
00:41:44,293 --> 00:41:46,083
Did you guys figure anything out?

748
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:49,413
- Get out of my way.
- Why? I thought we were working together.

749
00:41:49,414 --> 00:41:51,454
- Follow us.
- Hurry up and get in the car.

750
00:41:51,455 --> 00:41:52,881
Follow them!

751
00:41:52,921 --> 00:41:56,446
[The Purple and Yellow couple...
Sniping and being helpful at the same time.]

752
00:41:56,447 --> 00:41:58,533
Wait, then is it 368?

753
00:41:58,534 --> 00:42:00,663
That would be 368 if you add 11 to 357.

754
00:42:01,719 --> 00:42:03,526
- Do you see it?
- Yeah, we see it.

755
00:42:03,527 --> 00:42:04,969
[Having found their way to
the right spot!]

756
00:42:06,868 --> 00:42:08,638
It's yeot!

757
00:42:10,895 --> 00:42:12,685
- Wow, that looks good.
- That look so good.

758
00:42:12,686 --> 00:42:14,415
- There it is!
- Where?

759
00:42:14,416 --> 00:42:16,103
- There it is!
- I don't see anything!

760
00:42:16,104 --> 00:42:17,631
- No, it's here.
- It's not there?

761
00:42:17,632 --> 00:42:20,398
[Discovers the mission envelope.]

762
00:42:20,399 --> 00:42:23,192
<i>Guess the number of people that will be
getting off from the arriving bus.</i>

763
00:42:23,193 --> 00:42:27,833
<i>One person must do standups while holding the
other in the amount that they guess wrong.</i>

764
00:42:29,044 --> 00:42:31,204
You have to guess the number of people
getting off from the arriving bus.

765
00:42:31,205 --> 00:42:33,687
- Do we have to do it in order of arrival?
- In order of arrival?

766
00:42:36,746 --> 00:42:39,971
[Guess the number of people who will be
getting off at this bus station.]

767
00:42:39,972 --> 00:42:41,147
You must be carrying the other
person while you guess.

768
00:42:41,148 --> 00:42:42,445
- Really?
- Seriously?

769
00:42:42,949 --> 00:42:44,473
- Sorry.
- No, it's okay.

770
00:42:44,474 --> 00:42:46,595
- Want to play for it?
- No, just get on.

771
00:42:46,596 --> 00:42:48,578
- I'll do it next time.
- Are you on my back yet?

772
00:42:49,872 --> 00:42:52,078
Okay, jump on.
One, two, three.

773
00:42:55,895 --> 00:42:56,974
Okay, tell me your guess.

774
00:42:56,975 --> 00:42:58,992
- Zero.
- One person.

775
00:43:00,894 --> 00:43:04,616
- I think it's just going to pass us by.
- Someone's going to have to get off.

776
00:43:05,757 --> 00:43:07,219
There it is!

777
00:43:08,091 --> 00:43:09,582
One person.
It's stopping.

778
00:43:10,193 --> 00:43:12,162
I know it's stopping,
but just keep going now.

779
00:43:13,228 --> 00:43:19,516
[Just how many people will
get off the bus?]

780
00:43:21,543 --> 00:43:25,223

It seems like some will be getting off...]

781
00:43:36,417 --> 00:43:40,057
[Both teams are wrong!
Four people get off the bus!]

782
00:43:40,058 --> 00:43:42,396
- I think I've got it figured out now.
- Okay, I know now.

783
00:43:43,295 --> 00:43:46,542
[Penalty for having gotten it wrong is to do
stand and sit ups five times.]

784
00:43:47,648 --> 00:43:49,206
Three.

785
00:43:50,860 --> 00:43:52,512
Four.

786
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:54,848
Okay, just one more!

787
00:43:55,725 --> 00:43:57,625
- Five!
- Okay.

788
00:43:57,626 --> 00:43:59,401
- Let's go with two next time.
- Two?

789
00:44:01,132 --> 00:44:05,459
[Jae Suk, Hye Jin, Kwang Soo, and
Seung Gi are still on the bus.]

790
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:08,024
Hye Jin told me that she was already dating
her husband when she went to Vietnam with us.

791
00:44:08,025 --> 00:44:09,356
- Really?
- That's right.

792
00:44:09,357 --> 00:44:12,029
She told me that she would be on the phone
while the rest of us were sleeping.

793
00:44:12,779 --> 00:44:14,797
That really makes me mad.

794
00:44:16,223 --> 00:44:19,605
- I had no idea.
- Even though she's tired, she won't sleep.

795
00:44:19,606 --> 00:44:21,586
I remember. You would
always fiddle with your cellphone.

796
00:44:21,587 --> 00:44:24,708
I'd always just wait for the moment
when the rest of you would fall asleep.

797
00:44:25,873 --> 00:44:28,255
[But why is he getting angry?]

798
00:44:29,257 --> 00:44:32,972
- Did you like Hye Jin?
- No, that's not it.

799
00:44:32,973 --> 00:44:36,140
[It must've been a dream of his?]

800
00:44:37,414 --> 00:44:40,923
-Then did you make a confession?
- No, I didn't do that.

801
00:44:40,924 --> 00:44:43,243
I remember him paying extra
attention to Hye Jin back then.

802
00:44:43,244 --> 00:44:46,338
- I remember he was Vietnam's Prince.
- That's right.

803
00:44:46,966 --> 00:44:52,375
When all those Vietnamese people were
constantly cheering Kwang Soo on

804
00:44:52,376 --> 00:44:54,641
I remember him always
looking towards Hye Jin.

805
00:44:54,829 --> 00:44:59,172
[Seems as though his random popularity
made him believe he had a chance.]

806
00:45:01,448 --> 00:45:05,882
There was a time back when I had the chance
to play soccer with Ki Sung Yong once.

807
00:45:05,883 --> 00:45:07,210
- Yeah.
- It was just for a moment.

808
00:45:07,211 --> 00:45:09,791
He's really good, and he's really big.

[That's because he's a soccer player...]

810
00:45:14,261 --> 00:45:17,506
- What are you talking about, Seung Gi?
- He was really good at it.

- He met you guys before too.
- You're right.

812
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:25,304
- Look at Ji Sung.
- He played with you once in China.

813
00:45:25,305 --> 00:45:27,868
- I remember that.
- When you missed your penalty kick.

814
00:45:27,869 --> 00:45:29,914
Why do you have to bring that up?

815
00:45:29,915 --> 00:45:33,694
- You missed your penalty kick?
- He missed that easy shot.

816

I missed by hitting the goal post.
I didn't completely miss it.

They took my glasses away and I couldn't see.
I'm lucky I was even able to get that close.

818

He was so nervous that his face
literally shrunk in on itself.

819
00:45:43,651 --> 00:45:45,355
He was so nervous.

820
00:45:45,926 --> 00:45:48,800
- Should I show these guys the picture?
- Let us see.

821
00:45:48,801 --> 00:45:51,850
It's a picture of Kwang Soo that
was published in the newspaper.

822
00:45:54,509 --> 00:45:56,890
Look at that, Seung Gi.

823
00:45:57,874 --> 00:46:00,461
- Your husband was standing behind me.
- Did you get hit on the head?

824

[Looking as though he was hit
pretty hard in the head.]

825

- There's Ki Sung Yong.
- I see that.

826
00:46:04,740 --> 00:46:06,508
How did you get your face to do that?

827
00:46:08,425 --> 00:46:10,883
I've never paid such close attention to the
number of people getting off the bus before.

828

- Give us your final answer.
- Zero people.

we get off.

I'm going to take a picture.

975
00:54:45,441 --> 00:54:46,520
[A picture?]

976
00:54:46,521 --> 00:54:47,780
- Kwang Soo.
- Yes, Jae Suk.

977
00:54:47,781 --> 00:54:50,484
[Taking revenge on all that he's had
to endure up to now?]

978
00:54:51,270 --> 00:54:53,186
- Kwang Soo.
- I'm taking a picture.

979
00:54:54,366 --> 00:54:56,742
Can you give me a wave or
something?

980
00:54:56,743 --> 00:54:58,400
We have to get going, Kwang Soo.

981
00:54:58,401 --> 00:55:00,128
- Thank you, Jae Suk.
- Okay.

982
00:55:00,129 --> 00:55:01,954
Leader!

983
00:55:01,955 --> 00:55:03,814
[The taxi leaves without them.]

984
00:55:04,726 --> 00:55:07,862
[Leader Kwang misses the cab
from his horsing around.]

985
00:55:07,863 --> 00:55:09,135
- Come on, Leader!
- Sorry, Seung Gi.

986
00:55:09,136 --> 00:55:11,041
- We missed the cab.
- I'm sorry.

987
00:55:11,042 --> 00:55:12,803
- Here's another one!
- Here it is.

988
00:55:13,952 --> 00:55:18,334
[On to Ha Ha's shop!]

989
00:55:20,514 --> 00:55:22,412
I want some potatoes.

990
00:55:22,413 --> 00:55:26,646
There were five cards to begin with.

991
00:55:26,647 --> 00:55:28,798
What did you pick earlier?
You chose seven, right?

992
00:55:28,799 --> 00:55:30,682
We picked five at first, right?

993
00:55:30,683 --> 00:55:32,761
- It means, it's 14357.
- Ah, 14357.

994
00:55:32,762 --> 00:55:35,298
That means that there's
a card marked with one.

995
00:55:35,299 --> 00:55:38,253
So we have to keep doing this
until we choose the one card.

996
00:55:38,254 --> 00:55:40,322
[It will be to their advantage to choose
the number one card.]

997
00:55:40,323 --> 00:55:42,221
You have to hold hands,
and only use your free hand.

998
00:55:42,914 --> 00:55:44,183
Ready.

999
00:55:44,184 --> 00:55:45,886
[Ji Hyo and Gary chose four.]

1000
00:55:46,375 --> 00:55:47,922
Ouch, that's hot!

1001
00:55:47,923 --> 00:55:50,094
Ouch, that's hot!
We have to peel and eat this?

1002
00:55:50,095 --> 00:55:51,922
[Not just hot, but very hot.]

1003
00:55:51,923 --> 00:55:53,833
- No, it's too hot.
- Just eat it.

1004
00:55:54,250 --> 00:55:56,080
[Taking a huge bite with the
skin still on.]

1005
00:55:59,530 --> 00:56:01,784
I feel like we're seeing what we must've
looked like during the first round.

1006
00:56:01,785 --> 00:56:04,033
[The potatoes definitely taste
the best when they are still hot.]

1007
00:56:04,034 --> 00:56:06,045
Here, Ji Hyo.
Ouch, that's hot!

1008
00:56:07,583 --> 00:56:10,173
[The potatoes are
even hotter than their love.]

1009
00:56:11,152 --> 00:56:12,513
Open wide.

1010
00:56:14,544 --> 00:56:16,391
[Ouch, that's hot!]

1011
00:56:16,392 --> 00:56:17,837
That's hot.

1012
00:56:18,646 --> 00:56:20,500
They're getting used to the heat now.

1013
00:56:20,501 --> 00:56:22,735
[The heat that can be felt
throughout their whole body.]

1014
00:56:24,634 --> 00:56:26,605
See?
They're doing the same things that we did.

1015
00:56:27,275 --> 00:56:30,341
[Still wrestling over their first potato
out of four.]

1016
00:56:31,339 --> 00:56:32,582
Stop.

1017
00:56:32,583 --> 00:56:34,081
[Fail]

1018
00:56:34,082 --> 00:56:35,654
- Was it the same for you guys?
- We were the same way.

1019
00:56:36,568 --> 00:56:38,371
[Back to Jong Kook and Bora.]

1020
00:56:38,372 --> 00:56:40,919
It's this one.
Why aren't you letting it go?

1021
00:56:44,837 --> 00:56:45,877
What is it?

1022
00:56:45,878 --> 00:56:49,631
[Seeing them that happy means...
Could it be?]

1023
00:56:49,632 --> 00:56:51,953
[They only have to eat one potato!]

1024
00:56:53,539 --> 00:56:55,941
What are you doing?
What are you guys all doing?

1025
00:56:55,942 --> 00:56:57,863
[Trying to pick out the biggest
potato for them.]

1026
00:56:58,714 --> 00:57:01,469
- Okay, let's go with that one.
- You have to eat that at least.

1027
00:57:01,470 --> 00:57:02,854
[So jealous]

1028
00:57:03,535 --> 00:57:05,647
[Jong Kook and Bora only have
to eat one potato.]

1029
00:57:07,403 --> 00:57:09,633
[Even though it's just one potato,
it's still hot as ever.]

1030
00:57:10,343 --> 00:57:11,853
[Shoves it into his mouth.]

1031
00:57:14,669 --> 00:57:17,558
[Mr. Capable is knocked out
by the heat of the potato!]

1032
00:57:17,559 --> 00:57:18,664
30 seconds left.

1033
00:57:20,461 --> 00:57:23,052
- One is too easy.
- They have to succeed this time.

1034
00:57:23,053 --> 00:57:24,827
[If it's only one...
you can muster through it.]

1035
00:57:25,237 --> 00:57:28,520
[Kkuk taking care of the last piece for Bora.]

1036
00:57:29,294 --> 00:57:32,523
[All they have left to do is whistle.]

1037
00:57:33,414 --> 00:57:34,548
Ten seconds.

1038
00:57:35,585 --> 00:57:37,009
I don't hear any whistling.

1039
00:57:37,010 --> 00:57:38,549
- He has to do it again.
- I heard it.

1040
00:57:38,550 --> 00:57:40,803
[The sound of his whistling sounds similar
to the owner of the restaurant's voice.]

1041
00:57:41,482 --> 00:57:42,910
Success.

1042
00:57:42,911 --> 00:57:45,128
[Jong Kook and Bora succeed their mission.]

1043
00:57:48,208 --> 00:57:51,275
[Jong Kook and Bora win lunch money.]

1044
00:57:51,276 --> 00:57:53,486
After all the potatoes we just ate?

1045
00:57:53,487 --> 00:57:56,060
It's lunch money?
But what kind of lunch money is this?

1046
00:57:56,061 --> 00:57:58,420
[But something feels off with
their lunch money envelope.]

1047
00:57:58,421 --> 00:58:00,506
Since our theme starts with 14,
you get 1,400 won each.

1048
00:58:00,507 --> 00:58:02,098
Okay.

1049
00:58:02,099 --> 00:58:04,762
- You can give it back if you don't want it.
- No, we're very happy with it.

1050
00:58:04,763 --> 00:58:12,225
<i>[Bicycle locker at the train station.]</i>

1051
00:58:15,710 --> 00:58:19,109
[Just then, Kwang Soo and
Seung Gi arrive.]

1052
00:58:19,110 --> 00:58:20,888
- Are you hungry, Seung Gi?
- I'm starving.

1053
00:58:20,889 --> 00:58:22,775
[Still unaware of what the mission is,
and only focused on the eating part.]

1054
00:58:24,612 --> 00:58:26,973
- You're giving us four?
- You chose number four, right?

1055
00:58:26,974 --> 00:58:30,716
[Kwang Soo and Seung Gi pick
number four for their first draw.]

1056
00:58:30,717 --> 00:58:32,544
Good luck, we're going to get going.

1057
00:58:32,545 --> 00:58:34,179
[Jong Kook and Bora leave from
having succeeded the mission already.]

1058
00:58:34,180 --> 00:58:36,044
[When are we ever going to
get to leave?]

1059
00:58:36,626 --> 00:58:38,217
Ouch, that's hot!
Wait, Kwang Soo.

1060
00:58:38,218 --> 00:58:39,878
- What is this?
- Do we just eat?

1061
00:58:39,879 --> 00:58:41,736
[Must finish all four within a minute.]

1062
00:58:41,737 --> 00:58:43,102
We just eat it?

1063
00:58:43,103 --> 00:58:44,958
[Takes a huge bite without any hesitation.]

1064
00:58:47,909 --> 00:58:50,065
[Foolish Kwang Soo taking a huge bite
of the steaming hot potato.]

1065
00:58:57,129 --> 00:59:00,038
[An exact reminder of the giraffe
from their zoo episode.]

1066
00:59:00,828 --> 00:59:02,451
That's what happens.

1067
00:59:02,452 --> 00:59:04,181
You're going to start crying in a bit.

1068
00:59:05,453 --> 00:59:08,269
[Seung Gi is taking his time eating
while blowing on it to cool it down.]

1069
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:11,723
[Why did you take such a
big bite like that?]

1070
00:59:12,599 --> 00:59:14,546
He is so odd looking.

1071
00:59:16,135 --> 00:59:19,795
[Just then, Jae Suk and
Hye Jin finally arrive.]

1072
00:59:21,557 --> 00:59:25,192
[Greeted with an odd scene
as soon as they arrive.]

1073
00:59:27,481 --> 00:59:29,654
[Kwang Soo and Seung Gi's
second attempt.]

1074
00:59:30,884 --> 00:59:32,754
[Please Kwang Soo]

1075
00:59:36,528 --> 00:59:39,507
[He picks the one card!]

1076
00:59:39,508 --> 00:59:42,409
[Leader's Kwang Soo's big contribution.]

1077
00:59:43,568 --> 00:59:44,962
We have to pick the biggest one.

1078
00:59:44,963 --> 00:59:47,761
There's no method to it,
and we just eat, right?

1079
00:59:47,762 --> 00:59:50,273
- We just eat, right?
- Did Jong Kook already leave?

1080
00:59:53,989 --> 00:59:55,501
Squish it down.

1081
00:59:56,070 --> 00:59:58,014
Potato pancake.
Let's turn it into a potato pancake.

1082
00:59:58,015 --> 00:59:59,207
[Plan is to turn it into potato pancake.]

1083
00:59:59,208 --> 01:00:02,409
[Plan is to thinly spread it out
so it cools down faster.]

1084
01:00:04,567 --> 01:00:05,809
It's so hot!

1085
01:00:07,371 --> 01:00:09,970
[Half breath... half spit.]

1086
01:00:10,557 --> 01:00:12,323
- Okay, eat it.
- Can you eat it like this?

1087
01:00:12,324 --> 01:00:14,067
[Pancakes are done,
and it's time to eat!]

1088
01:00:18,567 --> 01:00:22,400
[It seems as though they did a decent job
having cooled it down.]

1089
01:00:22,401 --> 01:00:25,102
[No... it's still hot.]

1090
01:00:26,916 --> 01:00:29,968
[But it's much more feasible now
that they only have to eat one.]

1091
01:00:29,969 --> 01:00:32,150
I think we can win this
on our first attempt, Hye Jin.

1092
01:00:32,151 --> 01:00:36,431
[In order to win during first attempt...
their only hope is to pick the one card.]

1093
01:00:37,501 --> 01:00:39,024
There are still some crumbs left.

1094
01:00:39,504 --> 01:00:41,853
[Scraping up every last bit
of the crumbs.]

1095
01:00:44,199 --> 01:00:45,673
He's not able to do it.
Kwang Soo can't do it.

1096
01:00:45,674 --> 01:00:46,993
[It's Kwang Soo's turn to whistle.]

1097
01:00:51,302 --> 01:00:52,967
58 seconds.

1098
01:00:52,968 --> 01:00:54,527
[Kwang Soo and Seung Gi succeeds!]

1099
01:00:54,528 --> 01:00:58,687
[Won by Kwang Soo's pick of the card,
and Seung Gi's smart plan.]

1100
01:00:59,319 --> 01:01:01,027
When you do it like that,
there's no need to chew.

1101
01:01:01,028 --> 01:01:05,237
[Did all the chewing with their fists,
so all they had left to do was swallow!]

1102
01:01:05,238 --> 01:01:06,838
- Not bad, right?
- That was good.

1103
01:01:06,839 --> 01:01:08,838
That was all Seung Gi's planning.

1104
01:01:08,839 --> 01:01:11,513
Then Seung Gi is the leader then?

1105
01:01:12,694 --> 01:01:14,663
[It seems as though
the real leader is Seung Gi.]

1106
01:01:17,109 --> 01:01:18,334
That's hot!

1107
01:01:19,646 --> 01:01:22,543
[The team in the last place still trying to
battle the potatoes' hotness.]

1108
01:01:24,793 --> 01:01:28,927
[Dancing machine trying to alleviate the
pain through dancing.]

1109
01:01:30,029 --> 01:01:34,455
[I doubt that these people... will even look
at another potato for a long while.]

1110
01:01:36,117 --> 01:01:38,311
[Quite a while later.]

1111
01:01:39,158 --> 01:01:43,784
[The two teams have arrived to share
lunch after completing the potato mission.]

1112
01:01:44,782 --> 01:01:47,059
Why don't you tell us something
about Mr. Ki?

1113
01:01:47,060 --> 01:01:49,654
- Oh, he's in Dubai right now.
- He's in Dubai.

1114
01:01:49,655 --> 01:01:51,854
- For the big match against Russia.
- I didn't know that.

1115
01:01:51,855 --> 01:01:55,422
[This episode was filmed a few days
after Korea's win again the Swiss.]

1116
01:01:55,423 --> 01:01:57,593
- You like Key that much?
- Yes.

1117
01:01:58,136 --> 01:02:01,227
[Ah... Key.. as in Sung Yong?]

1118
01:02:01,228 --> 01:02:02,981
- It's not 'Key', it's 'Ki'.
- But they pronounce it 'Key', right?

1119
01:02:02,981 --> 01:02:04,645
- In England they do.
- Yes, Key.

1120
01:02:04,646 --> 01:02:07,145
Can't you ever let Suk Jin
just say something?

1121
01:02:07,146 --> 01:02:10,466
[Even though what he's saying is right,
when it's Big-nosed Brother saying it...]

1122
01:02:10,467 --> 01:02:12,562
When you say, Key, it makes us
think of a SHINee member.

1123
01:02:13,381 --> 01:02:16,957
Then you guys were in total honeymoon
phase while you were in England?

1124
01:02:16,958 --> 01:02:19,032
- Yes.
- Just the two of you, right?

1125
01:02:19,033 --> 01:02:21,624
- I heard they were in the northern part.
- Ah, northern?

1126
01:02:21,625 --> 01:02:23,105
- It's cold over there.
- Yes, it's cold.

1127
01:02:23,682 --> 01:02:26,386
[Mr. Big-nose a.k.a. England Expert.]

1128
01:02:26,387 --> 01:02:28,816
- Here comes the food.
- Thank you.

1129
01:02:28,817 --> 01:02:31,814
You two can just snuggle together
when it gets too cold.

1130
01:02:32,594 --> 01:02:35,979
- Why don't you do that with your wife?
- My house is too hot.

1131
01:02:37,074 --> 01:02:39,441
There's no need to say that
because my house is always hot.

1132
01:02:40,012 --> 01:02:41,621
- It's snowing.
- Really?

1133
01:02:42,638 --> 01:02:44,404
- It's first snowfall.
- It is!

1134
01:02:44,405 --> 01:02:51,902
[Delighted by the first snowfall of 2013
during the shooting of this episode.]

1135
01:02:51,903 --> 01:02:53,493
You have to make your wish now.

1136
01:02:56,918 --> 01:02:58,298
- It's snowing.
- It's snowing!

1137
01:02:58,299 --> 01:02:59,674
It's first snowfall!

1138
01:03:01,221 --> 01:03:03,013
I can't believe you're the one I'm with
during first snowfall.

1139
01:03:03,014 --> 01:03:05,573
- Awesome.
- I can't believe this sudden snow.

1140
01:03:09,518 --> 01:03:13,373
[DJ Seung Gi taking it upon himself
to start playing Christmas carols.]

1141
01:03:17,603 --> 01:03:18,996
What did you say?

1142
01:03:18,997 --> 01:03:22,470
[Kwang-vatar speaking his special Avatar
language for the first time in a long time.]

1143
01:03:24,040 --> 01:03:25,494
I can't believe it's the first snowfall.

1144
01:03:27,529 --> 01:03:30,406
- You have a decent voice.
- This is so nice.

1145
01:03:30,407 --> 01:03:33,348
[The first snowfall is as beautiful
as Kwang Soo's voice.]

1146
01:03:39,705 --> 01:03:42,228
[Excited Giraffe.]

1147
01:03:42,229 --> 01:03:44,294
- I'm going to dance for a minute.
- Go ahead.

1148
01:03:47,348 --> 01:03:50,460
You have to pay him more for doing this.
He needs to be paid more for this.

1149
01:03:51,143 --> 01:03:53,888
He really does move around a lot.
Keep on moving.

1150
01:03:53,889 --> 01:03:55,230
[If the amount of movement is what counts,
then he's the best Korea has to offer.]

1151
01:03:55,231 --> 01:03:58,130
[It's a bit tight in here...
but it's still fun!]

1152
01:03:58,840 --> 01:04:01,013
- It's the first snowfall, Gary!
- This is first snowfall?

1153
01:04:01,014 --> 01:04:03,065
This is first snowfall of the year.

1154
01:04:03,066 --> 01:04:04,675
I'm going to make a wish.

1155
01:04:05,560 --> 01:04:07,055
What are you wishing for?

1156
01:04:08,170 --> 01:04:11,156
Don't say something about me being single,
and asking me to get married off.

1157
01:04:11,157 --> 01:04:12,842
I'm single too.

1158
01:04:14,833 --> 01:04:18,741
[Driving through the snow while
making their own separate wishes...]

1159
01:04:31,458 --> 01:04:33,098
Shinchon Train Station.

1160
01:04:34,291 --> 01:04:37,169
[Jong Kook and Bora are the first ones
to arrive at the train station.]

1161
01:04:38,354 --> 01:04:39,756
What is this?

1162
01:04:40,443 --> 01:04:43,899
[Are those hoola hoops tied up
to the bicycles?]

1163
01:04:44,487 --> 01:04:47,084
You have to go pick three people
out of the crowd.

1164
01:04:47,085 --> 01:04:48,697
[Pick three people out of the crowd.]

1165
01:04:49,736 --> 01:04:51,865
- Hello!
- It has to be someone light.

1166
01:04:54,482 --> 01:04:57,685
[Could it be a mission where a man's
strength could become useful?]

1167
01:05:01,494 --> 01:05:03,349
- Can you help us?
- You're so pretty.

1168
01:05:04,390 --> 01:05:07,231
[A sturdy looking man to
help with their mission.]

1169
01:05:08,441 --> 01:05:10,170
Any athletic person here?

1170
01:05:10,171 --> 01:05:15,172
[The sun comes back out again...]

1171
01:05:15,173 --> 01:05:18,929
<i>[All five members of the team must jump
through the hoola hoop to succeed.]</i>

1172
01:05:18,964 --> 01:05:21,002
- Like this?
- This?

1173
01:05:21,003 --> 01:05:22,889
[All five people must jump
through the hoop.]

1174
01:05:23,686 --> 01:05:26,798
[But then why are the hoola hoops
strapped onto the bike?]

1175
01:05:27,382 --> 01:05:29,166
- Okay, we'll do this one.
- Want this one?

1176
01:05:29,167 --> 01:05:32,108
Do you want us to unlock it?
I bet the code is 14357.

1177
01:05:34,124 --> 01:05:37,187
[Will that be the right number?]

1178
01:05:38,898 --> 01:05:42,696
[Wow- Bora unlocks the lock
on her first try!]

1179
01:05:42,697 --> 01:05:44,759
Do you see him getting ready?
He's tightening up his shoelaces.

1180
01:05:44,760 --> 01:05:47,472
[I'm ready.]

1181
01:05:49,258 --> 01:05:52,216
[Monday Couple is the second team
to arrive.]

1182
01:05:53,554 --> 01:05:57,100
[Kwang Soo and Seung Gi arrive
soon thereafter.]

1183
01:06:01,048 --> 01:06:03,205
Are there any thin men out here?

1184
01:06:03,668 --> 01:06:05,190
- You think you can do it?
- Yes.

1185
01:06:06,860 --> 01:06:08,842
- You think you can jump?
- Don't worry.

1186
01:06:08,843 --> 01:06:10,733
It's going to be a rough game.

1187
01:06:10,734 --> 01:06:13,016
[Thank you to all the fans who came out
on a cold day like this.]

1188
01:06:13,017 --> 01:06:14,326
We're going to practice.

1189
01:06:14,570 --> 01:06:16,766
[Team Jong Kook and Bora goes first.]

1190
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:19,600
- Fighting.
- Fighting!

1191
01:06:20,644 --> 01:06:21,894
- Here we go.
- Okay.

1192
01:06:25,779 --> 01:06:27,822
[Oh... they're pretty quick.]

1193
01:06:30,118 --> 01:06:34,035
[No way... could they really
succeed on their first try?]

1194
01:06:38,112 --> 01:06:40,340
[Giraffe interrupting at a crucial moment.]

1195
01:06:40,341 --> 01:06:42,549
[Jong Kook and Bora fail.]

1196
01:06:45,966 --> 01:06:48,031
[Good job... my leader!]

1197
01:06:48,032 --> 01:06:49,710
One, two, three.
Challenge!

1198
01:06:49,711 --> 01:06:51,200
[Team Gary and Ji Hyo's challenge.]

1199
01:06:52,991 --> 01:06:56,368
[Even though it's a bit weak,
the hoop is going down a precise path.]

1200
01:06:58,748 --> 01:07:01,066
[The Giraffe sneaks in again.]

1201
01:07:09,780 --> 01:07:11,913
[Oh my God.]

1202
01:07:14,489 --> 01:07:16,355
That really could've been bad, Gary.

1203
01:07:17,016 --> 01:07:19,246
I was looking out for him.
There was a camera over here.

1204
01:07:20,349 --> 01:07:23,737
[Giraffe was just trying to
protect the camera?]

1205
01:07:24,494 --> 01:07:27,603
[Leader Kwang is number one when it comes
to interfering in others' success.]

1206
01:07:27,604 --> 01:07:30,585
- Let's get this done, Seung Gi.
- Everyone move up just a bit.

1207
01:07:30,586 --> 01:07:32,977
Everyone run towards the hoop
and jump with all your might.

1208
01:07:33,303 --> 01:07:36,624
All of you rush forward
towards the hoola hoop.

1209
01:07:37,243 --> 01:07:38,727
- Challenge.
- One, two, three.

1210
01:07:38,728 --> 01:07:40,279
- Challenge!
- Challenge.

1211
01:07:40,824 --> 01:07:43,031
[Ah... challenge...]

1212
01:07:43,032 --> 01:07:45,778
[Totally off sync right from the start.]

1213
01:07:45,779 --> 01:07:47,620
One, two, three.
Challenge.

1214
01:07:50,996 --> 01:07:52,861
Jump!
Jump!

1215
01:07:53,211 --> 01:07:55,310
[Leader Kwang's energetic coaching.]

1216
01:07:58,692 --> 01:08:01,188
[Why aren't you jumping?]

1217
01:08:01,997 --> 01:08:03,702
[Kwang Soo and Seung Gi fail.]

1218
01:08:03,703 --> 01:08:07,697
- I don't think I should be coaching.
- What kind of a leader are you?

1219
01:08:09,211 --> 01:08:11,031
- No more interrupting.
- Okay.

1220
01:08:11,032 --> 01:08:13,679
He really won't interrupt this time, Bora.
I'll make sure of it.

1221
01:08:13,680 --> 01:08:14,850
- You promise?
- I promise.

1222
01:08:14,851 --> 01:08:17,181
If he interferes, then I'm not
singing with you at your concert.

1223
01:08:17,182 --> 01:08:19,470
Okay, I got it.
Don't make scary comments like that.

1224
01:08:19,471 --> 01:08:21,358
Don't make scary comments
like that to me.

1225
01:08:21,788 --> 01:08:23,076
What is this?

1226
01:08:23,077 --> 01:08:25,357
[Jae Suk and Hye Jin also arrive.]

1227
01:08:25,786 --> 01:08:28,941
[First and Fourth place teams seeing
each other for the first time since opening.]

1228
01:08:28,942 --> 01:08:32,079
- What have you guys been up to?
- We've been coming in at first place.

1229
01:08:33,572 --> 01:08:36,072
[Jong Kook and Bora's second attempt.]

1230
01:08:38,144 --> 01:08:40,696
[Oh... off to a nice start.]

1231
01:08:42,759 --> 01:08:44,999
[Will they really succeed this time?]

1232
01:08:51,869 --> 01:08:54,447
[Enraged Tiger!]

1233
01:08:54,448 --> 01:08:58,158
I really didn't do anything!

1234
01:08:58,159 --> 01:09:00,989
- I really didn't do anything!
- Yes, you did!

1235
01:09:00,990 --> 01:09:05,294
[Giraffe's existence is
an interference in itself?]

1236
01:09:06,370 --> 01:09:08,650
Let's just get this done in one shot.

1237
01:09:11,047 --> 01:09:13,413
[Even Jae Suk and Hye Jin unlock the
lock in one try and gets their hoop.]

1238
01:09:13,414 --> 01:09:15,271
[Team Gary and Ji Hyo's second attempt.]

1239
01:09:15,272 --> 01:09:16,971
Don't do anything funny, Kwang Soo.

1240
01:09:16,972 --> 01:09:19,073
[Yes... I'll try.]

1241
01:09:22,632 --> 01:09:25,422
[Ji Hyo runs off to stop Kwang Soo.]

1242
01:09:34,379 --> 01:09:36,668
[Extreme injury]

1243
01:09:37,569 --> 01:09:39,822
[Mr. Gary... you poor thing...]

1244
01:09:40,534 --> 01:09:42,612
[Delinquent Ji Hyo rears her head.]

1245
01:09:43,081 --> 01:09:45,108
[Trying to rehabilitate himself?]

1246
01:09:45,109 --> 01:09:46,499
Yes, I'm okay.

1247
01:09:48,592 --> 01:09:51,192
[It's just my nature.
What am I supposed to do about it?]

1248
01:09:51,193 --> 01:09:53,041
I apologize for my team member.

1249
01:09:54,511 --> 01:09:55,901
Let's try this again.

1250
01:09:55,902 --> 01:09:58,058
[Team Jong Kook and Bora's other attempt.]

1251
01:09:58,059 --> 01:09:59,107
Challenge.

1252
01:10:01,574 --> 01:10:04,511
[Top speed.]

1253
01:10:05,996 --> 01:10:08,825
[Could they succeed this time?]

1254
01:10:08,825 --> 01:10:11,396
[Foreigner coming to his rescue to
stop the Giraffe from interfering.]

1255
01:10:20,272 --> 01:10:22,404
[Jong Kook and Bora succeeds!]

1256
01:10:22,405 --> 01:10:25,966
[Jong Kook and Bora finishes first again!]

1257
01:10:28,513 --> 01:10:30,218
I'm sorry, but can you take
a picture of us?

1258
01:10:30,567 --> 01:10:33,550
- Take a picture of us.
- You want me to?

1259
01:10:33,551 --> 01:10:37,310
- Take a picture for us.
- I'm working right now.

1260
01:10:37,311 --> 01:10:39,143
- Take a picture for us.
- Seriously.

1261
01:10:39,144 --> 01:10:42,136
- Just three pictures.
- One, two, three.

1262
01:10:42,754 --> 01:10:45,576
[Thank you to all those that came out
to help us on this cold day!]

1263
01:10:46,349 --> 01:10:50,946
<i>[The 'R' warehouse on the way to Ilsan.]</i>

1264
01:11:00,114 --> 01:11:03,048
We need to get to Ilsan.
Can you take us to Ilsan?

1265
01:11:03,049 --> 01:11:04,982
[Flagging down a taxi to get to
their final location as quickly as they can.]

1266
01:11:06,647 --> 01:11:08,654
It feels really good
to come in at first place.

1267
01:11:08,655 --> 01:11:11,396
- The ending is what's important though.
- Seriously.

1268
01:11:11,840 --> 01:11:14,499
Things like this happen a lot.
You can start off in first place

1269
01:11:14,500 --> 01:11:16,302
then you lose at the end.

1270
01:11:16,303 --> 01:11:18,896
I feel like they can catch up to us
very quickly from that mission.

1271
01:11:18,897 --> 01:11:20,723
As long as they're not interrupted.

1272
01:11:20,724 --> 01:11:23,526
We almost succeeded several times,
but because of Kwang Soo...

1273
01:11:24,860 --> 01:11:26,700
He really is a strange one.

1274
01:11:29,296 --> 01:11:31,351
- 14357!
- 14357?

1275
01:11:31,352 --> 01:11:34,358
[Everything began with 14357.]

1276
01:11:34,359 --> 01:11:39,263
[Running Man members having started with
the number to begin their missions...]

1277
01:11:39,264 --> 01:11:43,601
[Just what kind of secret awaits them
at the final location?]

1278
01:11:48,584 --> 01:11:51,961
[Final mission location-
Arriving at the warehouse in Ilsan.]

1279
01:11:53,009 --> 01:11:56,077
[This seems like the warehouse...]

1280
01:11:56,078 --> 01:11:57,417
- Come this way.
- That way?

1281
01:11:58,153 --> 01:12:00,327
- What's that line for?
- Why is there a line?

1282
01:12:00,328 --> 01:12:02,722
- Is it distance jumping?
- What is this line for?

1283
01:12:04,144 --> 01:12:05,890
- You're the first ones to arrive.
- Yes.

1284
01:12:05,891 --> 01:12:07,930
This is your bonus hint mission.

1285
01:12:08,681 --> 01:12:11,576
- Do you remember the numbers you were given?
- Yes.

1286
01:12:11,577 --> 01:12:13,496
- What is it?
- 14357.

1287
01:12:13,497 --> 01:12:18,159
14357.
Therefore, it's 1.3m plus 3.57m.

1288
01:12:18,160 --> 01:12:19,510
What's the total?

1289
01:12:19,511 --> 01:12:21,069
Then that's four...

1290
01:12:21,070 --> 01:12:24,285
No, you have to start adding
from the back.

1291
01:12:24,286 --> 01:12:28,645
You have to start adding from the back
to carry the number up front.

1292
01:12:28,646 --> 01:12:30,948
- Then the decimal...
- You have to carry it up.

1293
01:12:30,949 --> 01:12:34,486
Then... is it 4.97?

1294
01:12:34,487 --> 01:12:37,101
4.57.
Yes, you've got it correct.

1295
01:12:37,530 --> 01:12:38,735
- I'm sorry.
- Didn't I tell you?

1296
01:12:38,736 --> 01:12:40,825
Let's not let others say that
athletes are ignorant idiots.

1297
01:12:40,826 --> 01:12:43,293
- I have a natural science degree.
- But I did the math in my head.

1298
01:12:43,294 --> 01:12:47,772
- I graduated with a natural science degree!
- I did too!

1299
01:12:48,303 --> 01:12:50,886
[It's nice to meet you,
fellow natural science graduate.]

1300
01:12:51,196 --> 01:12:53,444
You see how it's marked at 4.97?

1301
01:12:53,445 --> 01:12:55,867
You have to take off your shoes at
where the 'R' mark is.

1302
01:12:55,868 --> 01:12:58,765
If you can shoot the shoe into the goal

1303
01:12:58,766 --> 01:13:01,974
then you can immediately enter the final
location without having to wait for others.

1304
01:13:02,208 --> 01:13:03,763
This isn't hard.

1305
01:13:03,764 --> 01:13:05,578
Okay, just like this.

1306
01:13:08,692 --> 01:13:11,186
[Oh... that's pretty accurate
for his first try.]

1307
01:13:14,221 --> 01:13:15,609
That's right.
That's how you do it.

1308
01:13:16,256 --> 01:13:18,392
[Just then!]

1309
01:13:18,393 --> 01:13:21,110
[Kwang Soo and Seung Gi
also arrive at the warehouse!]

1310
01:13:24,346 --> 01:13:27,302
[Jong Kook and Bora get to re-try
by the split of a hair.]

1311
01:13:28,046 --> 01:13:30,533
[His true nature making him want to try
interfering their game again.]

1312
01:13:31,006 --> 01:13:34,397
[If he can't interrupt...]

1313
01:13:34,398 --> 01:13:36,801
[Then it's time to pay defense!]

1314
01:13:40,550 --> 01:13:42,688
[Bora beats him down to the ground!]

1315
01:13:44,627 --> 01:13:46,299
What did I just do?

1316
01:13:58,629 --> 01:14:01,168
[Jong Kook and Bora
succeeds the hint mission!]

1317
01:14:01,169 --> 01:14:03,711
[He's better at this than soccer?]

1318
01:14:03,712 --> 01:14:04,901
We won!

1319
01:14:05,332 --> 01:14:08,275
[Matter of urgency!
Seung Gi and Kwang Soo's turn.]

1320
01:14:08,276 --> 01:14:10,446
[Jong Kook and Bora enter the
final mission location.]

1321
01:14:18,337 --> 01:14:21,776
[How can this be?
Kwang Soo succeeds in his first attempt!]

1322
01:14:24,586 --> 01:14:27,231
[Kwang Soo and Seung Gi
must hurry into the warehouse!]

1323
01:14:27,232 --> 01:14:29,831
[Kwang Leader seems to be on
a lucky streak today!]

1324
01:14:30,755 --> 01:14:32,373
You're the best!
You are a true leader!

1325
01:14:33,301 --> 01:14:34,981
- I told you to just trust me!
- You are a true leader.

1326
01:14:44,093 --> 01:14:46,093
- I told you to just trust me!
- You are a true leader.

1327
01:14:50,070 --> 01:14:51,577
Wow, what is this?

1328
01:14:57,927 --> 01:14:59,674
You've made it to your final mission.

1329
01:14:59,675 --> 01:15:02,239
- Do you all see the number panel up there?
- Yes.

1330
01:15:02,240 --> 01:15:05,142
You have to go up one at a time,
and you'll only have one chance.

1331
01:15:05,143 --> 01:15:08,633
If you press the number, and you get it right,
then the door in front of you will open.

1332
01:15:08,634 --> 01:15:10,613
[A numbers riddle in front of them-
Team to guess the number correct wins.]

1333
01:15:10,614 --> 01:15:14,133
If you get it wrong...
just stand by and see what happens.

1334
01:15:14,134 --> 01:15:15,937
Okay, here's your final hint.

1335
01:15:17,056 --> 01:15:18,596
The answer...

1336
01:15:19,097 --> 01:15:21,712
is within today's mission.

1337
01:15:21,713 --> 01:15:25,703
[Final hint-
The answer lies within today's hint.]

1338
01:15:27,100 --> 01:15:33,172
[This is it... the final set of numbers
we have to guess correctly.]

1339
01:15:35,160 --> 01:15:38,545
- This is really hard.
- The answer lies within today's mission.

1340
01:15:38,546 --> 01:15:42,180
If we can it wrong on our first attempt,
can we make another attempt?

1341
01:15:42,181 --> 01:15:44,470
- No.
- We only get one try?

1342
01:15:44,471 --> 01:15:51,348
[Only one chance...
Guess the number, and your team wins!]

1343
01:15:51,874 --> 01:15:56,029
[Number that started with 14357...
And all the missions they've completed...]

1344
01:15:56,030 --> 01:16:01,728
[Just what is the final and ultimate number?]

1345
01:16:03,157 --> 01:16:06,839
[Meanwhile, the remaining three teams have
yet to make it inside the warehouse.]

1346
01:16:07,831 --> 01:16:09,361
This is all about luck.

1347
01:16:11,673 --> 01:16:14,990
[Jae Suk and Hye Jin succeed the mission
on their first attempt.]

1348
01:16:15,179 --> 01:16:17,361
He's always good at things like this.

1349
01:16:17,362 --> 01:16:18,705
That's unbelievable.

1350
01:16:20,247 --> 01:16:24,442
[Jae Suk and Hye Jin enter
final mission location.]

1351
01:16:25,184 --> 01:16:27,025
Okay, we're going to go in now then.

1352
01:16:28,273 --> 01:16:30,255
Don't think about it too much, and just do it.

1353
01:16:32,053 --> 01:16:34,511
You have to bounce it off the wall.

1354
01:16:34,512 --> 01:16:35,929
That's what I was trying to do.

1355
01:16:35,930 --> 01:16:37,805
I just succeeded the mission in one try.

1356
01:16:37,806 --> 01:16:40,412
Yes, and this is the first time we've
escaped coming in at last place.

1357
01:16:41,768 --> 01:16:43,759
It's very possible for you to turn this around
and become the winner.

1358
01:16:43,760 --> 01:16:48,390
- 14357.
- 14357.

1359
01:16:48,391 --> 01:16:50,638
Here's your final mission for today's race.

1360
01:16:50,639 --> 01:16:54,199
- What is it?
- It's the... Final Number.

1361
01:16:54,200 --> 01:16:58,817
[Final number-
Guess the correct final number!]

1362
01:16:58,818 --> 01:17:00,383
The answer...

1363
01:17:00,750 --> 01:17:04,647
The answer lies within today's mission.

1364
01:17:04,648 --> 01:17:08,394
[The answer lies within today's mission.]

1365
01:17:08,395 --> 01:17:11,102
You can go up as soon as you're ready.

1366
01:17:16,331 --> 01:17:19,704
[All five teams are discussing and trying
to figure out what the final number could be.]

1367
01:17:21,745 --> 01:17:23,634
This is crazy.
I'm not good at things like this.

1368
01:17:23,635 --> 01:17:25,106
I'm not good at this either.

1369
01:17:25,107 --> 01:17:26,569
We need to call Sherlock Holmes.

1370
01:17:27,016 --> 01:17:31,691
- Wow, this is hard.
- I think it's a number from 14357.

1371
01:17:31,692 --> 01:17:33,328
But this is really odd too.

1372
01:17:33,329 --> 01:17:35,776
they could've just given us the address.

1373
01:17:36,132 --> 01:17:39,199
Doesn't this look like they purposely
put those words in here for some reason?

1374
01:17:39,200 --> 01:17:41,617
[Odd looking mission cards?]

1375
01:17:45,057 --> 01:17:48,545
But I don't think
it's about adding the numbers.

1376
01:17:48,546 --> 01:17:51,604
[Jae Suk and Hye Jin trying to
make sense of all the numbers.]

1377
01:17:51,605 --> 01:17:53,664
I never knew numbers could be
so confusing.

1378
01:17:55,238 --> 01:17:57,572
It has to be one of these two,
or I've got nothing.

1379
01:17:57,573 --> 01:17:59,709
Excuse me.
We're going to make our attempt.

1380
01:18:00,841 --> 01:18:04,118
[Blank...]

1381
01:18:04,119 --> 01:18:05,810
What are you two thinking about so hard?

1382
01:18:07,171 --> 01:18:09,486
- 14357.
- Try adding 11 to 14357.

1383
01:18:09,487 --> 01:18:12,312
14368.

1384
01:18:12,313 --> 01:18:13,925
What do we do with your shop?

1385
01:18:13,926 --> 01:18:18,275
Could there be something with numbers?
Even if there is, others won't know.

1386
01:18:19,295 --> 01:18:23,495
[Could the addition in previous mission
cards be one of their crucial hints?]

1387
01:18:24,070 --> 01:18:26,813
If it's not this one, then it has to be this.

1388
01:18:26,814 --> 01:18:31,025
[Jong Kook and Bora having decided
that it's a two digit number.]

1389
01:18:34,910 --> 01:18:36,412
- Challenge.
- Challenge!

1390
01:18:36,957 --> 01:18:40,126
[Order of attempts are
on first come first served basis.]

1391
01:18:40,127 --> 01:18:44,228
- Seung Gi did all the work, didn't he?
- No, leader did everything this time.

1392
01:18:44,229 --> 01:18:46,788
- I showed him what being a leader is about.
- If we get it wrong, then it's his fault.

1393
01:18:46,789 --> 01:18:48,950
But we're going to guess it right first.

1394
01:18:49,786 --> 01:18:52,156
We have two possibilities.

1395
01:18:52,157 --> 01:18:54,679
[Jong Kook and Bora are first
to attempt to make their guess.]

1396
01:18:55,298 --> 01:18:56,769
- Fighting!
- Fighting.

1397
01:18:56,770 --> 01:19:00,988
[Jong Kook steps up to the
metal door first.]

1398
01:19:05,672 --> 01:19:10,886
[Guess the number correct,
and the door shall open.]

1399
01:19:10,887 --> 01:19:12,196
Here I go.

1400
01:19:12,197 --> 01:19:13,439
- Bora.
- Yes?

1401
01:19:13,440 --> 01:19:14,813
- Fighting!
- Wish me luck.

1402
01:19:14,814 --> 01:19:16,053
Okay!

1403
01:19:16,054 --> 01:19:18,054
- You're going to get it.
- Right?

1404
01:19:21,902 --> 01:19:24,240
- That's kind of like ours...
- Very similar, I think.

1405
01:19:30,635 --> 01:19:33,475
[Having pressed 1 and 4 so far.]

1406
01:19:38,088 --> 01:19:42,006
[Could Jong Kook and Bora's
guess be correct?]

1407
01:19:42,007 --> 01:19:46,888
We started off with 14357,
then we were told to add 11 to it.

1408
01:19:46,889 --> 01:19:52,318
Then the penalty was five sit ups when
we got it wrong at the bus mission.

1409
01:19:52,991 --> 01:19:58,341
Then we were give one minute to eat
during the potato mission, so that's one.

1410
01:19:59,729 --> 01:20:02,624
And we were asked to get three helpers,
so we chose the number three.

1411
01:20:03,613 --> 01:20:05,231
So we've added all those numbers together.

1412
01:20:05,232 --> 01:20:08,784
[All added together is 14377.]

1413
01:20:11,286 --> 01:20:15,330
[Jong Kook completed inputting 14377.]

1414
01:20:15,861 --> 01:20:17,449
We didn't get the seven.

1415
01:20:17,450 --> 01:20:19,445
[Other teams seem to have
differing answers.]

1416
01:20:19,446 --> 01:20:22,877
As long as Jae Suk isn't thinking what we are,
then we really may have a chance to win.

1417
01:20:30,656 --> 01:20:39,588
[Could the number be 14377?]

1418
01:20:49,294 --> 01:20:52,618
[He disappeared beneath the ground!]

1419
01:20:52,619 --> 01:20:54,468
- What is that?
- What just happened?

1420
01:20:54,469 --> 01:20:57,290
- What is that?
- What's the big idea?

1421
01:20:58,306 --> 01:21:00,968
- That really scared me!
- That's too scary.

1422
01:21:01,865 --> 01:21:06,484
[If you get the number wrong,
then you'll disappear beneath the floor!]

1423
01:21:07,664 --> 01:21:09,811
I think I'm going to be too nervous
to do this mission.

1424
01:21:09,812 --> 01:21:11,697
You need to think about it
some more, Bora.

1425
01:21:11,698 --> 01:21:13,856
Why? Why do I need
to think about it some more?

1426
01:21:13,857 --> 01:21:16,885
- What's the need?
- Do whatever you want.

1427
01:21:20,645 --> 01:21:24,823
[Jong Kook and Sistar's Bora-
Making her attempt at the correct number.]

1428
01:21:32,232 --> 01:21:36,197
[Pressing down the numbers
without any hesitation.]

1429
01:21:37,927 --> 01:21:39,632
I'm going to add these numbers.

1430
01:21:39,633 --> 01:21:44,946
Jong Kook is going to try 14377,
which is an addition of all the numbers.

1431
01:21:44,947 --> 01:21:48,391
But if that's wrong, then I'm
going to take the 1 potato out of it.

1432
01:21:50,200 --> 01:21:58,202
[Then could the number be 14377 minus one?]

1433
01:21:59,246 --> 01:22:05,890
[Could the number be
14376 like she thinks it is?]

1434
01:22:06,977 --> 01:22:08,719
14376!

1435
01:22:11,204 --> 01:22:14,562
[The number isn't 14376 either!]

1436
01:22:14,563 --> 01:22:16,120
Are you sure that's safe?

1437
01:22:17,416 --> 01:22:18,929
Are you sure it's even possible
to get the answer?

1438
01:22:18,930 --> 01:22:20,766
- She's crying.
- I'm fine.

1439
01:22:21,890 --> 01:22:23,316
<i>I'm fine.</i>

1440
01:22:28,868 --> 01:22:30,895
Hye Jin, do you want me to go first?

1441
01:22:30,896 --> 01:22:33,041
[Time for Jae Suk and Hye Jin's turn.]

1442
01:22:33,042 --> 01:22:34,772
Actually, why don't you go first?

1443
01:22:35,356 --> 01:22:37,756
Hye Jin, input this number, okay?

1444
01:22:38,260 --> 01:22:40,591
- You know the number, right?
- Yes.

1445
01:22:40,592 --> 01:22:43,964
[Hye Jin going up first to make
her attempt at guessing the number.]

1446
01:22:43,965 --> 01:22:47,242
[This team hasn't been able to come up
with more than one possibility.]

1447
01:22:48,339 --> 01:22:49,468
Challenge.

1448
01:22:49,469 --> 01:22:51,951
If you fall through,
then we're ruined, Hye Jin.

1449
01:22:51,952 --> 01:22:54,266
[Stepping up to the door with confidence.]

1450
01:22:58,511 --> 01:23:00,944
Please shout out the number clearly
once you're finished inputting it.

1451
01:23:01,604 --> 01:23:07,014
[Just what is the number that
she's thinking of?]

1452
01:23:08,494 --> 01:23:09,609
11?

1453
01:23:14,519 --> 01:23:16,862
I see what they're doing.

1454
01:23:16,863 --> 01:23:18,790
I see.

1455
01:23:18,791 --> 01:23:22,356
[Just how did Jae Suk and Hye Jin
come up with their number?]

1456
01:23:22,886 --> 01:23:26,132
11... then 5.

1457
01:23:26,133 --> 01:23:29,794
Then it was one minute,
then lastly, it was three people.

1458
01:23:32,385 --> 01:23:35,178
If it's not 11513...

1459
01:23:35,179 --> 01:23:37,352
Then could this be it?
11513?

1460
01:23:41,826 --> 01:23:49,178
[Jae Suk and Hye Jin's guess is 11513.]

1461
01:23:49,179 --> 01:23:50,961
How did they come up with
that number?

1462
01:23:50,962 --> 01:23:54,489
- Shout it out.
- 11513.

1463
01:23:57,284 --> 01:24:04,045
[Could their number be correct?]

1464
01:24:04,046 --> 01:24:06,354
- 11513!
- Please.

1465
01:24:11,919 --> 01:24:14,244
- That was so scary!
- Wasn't that startling?

1466
01:24:14,245 --> 01:24:16,215
Isn't it totally scary?

1467
01:24:17,148 --> 01:24:23,589
Yoo Jae Suk!
Yoo Jae Suk!

1468
01:24:24,565 --> 01:24:26,927
I don't think this is it.
Hye Jin!

1469
01:24:27,654 --> 01:24:29,306
- Hey Jin!
- Yes?

1470
01:24:29,307 --> 01:24:32,071
- This doesn't seem right, does it?
- I don't think it is.

1471
01:24:33,814 --> 01:24:36,110
I'm going to go think this one through.

1472
01:24:36,111 --> 01:24:38,108
- I'll go first.
- Lee Kwang Soo!

1473
01:24:38,109 --> 01:24:40,803
[Next up is Kwang Soo and Seung Gi.]

1474
01:24:40,804 --> 01:24:45,019
[Jae Suk either has to take his turn now,
or go to the back of the line.]

1475
01:24:45,020 --> 01:24:46,612
This is driving me crazy.

1476
01:24:46,907 --> 01:24:48,572
I'm going to go to the end of the line.

1477
01:24:49,195 --> 01:24:52,491
Director, we only have one guess.

1478
01:24:52,817 --> 01:24:54,864
If I fall through,
then go to the back of the line.

1479
01:24:54,865 --> 01:24:56,712
I'll just go home instead.

1480
01:24:57,556 --> 01:24:58,771
Challenge.

1481
01:25:01,511 --> 01:25:06,792
[Kwang Soo and Seung Gi-
Leader Kwang makes his attempt.]

1482
01:25:07,132 --> 01:25:08,833
We only have one chance.

1483
01:25:08,834 --> 01:25:11,029
I will show you what being a leader
is all about!

1484
01:25:11,030 --> 01:25:14,383
This was your idea and your leading.

1485
01:25:14,384 --> 01:25:16,834
So if you get this right,
then you really are a true leader.

1486
01:25:16,835 --> 01:25:18,509
Are you just trying to thwart your
share of the responsibility on me?

1487
01:25:18,510 --> 01:25:19,687
No, that's not it.

1488
01:25:20,943 --> 01:25:23,799
You were the one who came up with it all,
and I had nothing to do with it.

1489
01:25:23,800 --> 01:25:25,799
You're already digging yourself
out of this, aren't you?

1490
01:25:25,800 --> 01:25:27,877
No, this is your moment to become
a true leader.

1491
01:25:27,878 --> 01:25:29,577
Okay, I'm going for it!

1492
01:25:49,371 --> 01:25:51,305
- 14358?
- They only added one?

1493
01:25:51,757 --> 01:25:54,388
- Why?
- There was plus 11.

1494
01:25:55,064 --> 01:25:56,251
Seriously?

1495
01:25:57,072 --> 01:25:58,619
Seung Gi!

1496
01:25:58,620 --> 01:26:00,584
Can I become a true leader?

1497
01:26:01,277 --> 01:26:02,931
Please!
Please let it be right!

1498
01:26:03,517 --> 01:26:06,321
14358!

1499
01:26:11,571 --> 01:26:13,050
What could it be?

1500
01:26:17,311 --> 01:26:21,062
[Leader Kwang seemed to have
thought of something...]

1501
01:26:21,523 --> 01:26:23,447
I honestly got chills right now.

1502
01:26:23,899 --> 01:26:25,398
I seriously got chills.

1503
01:26:25,399 --> 01:26:27,459
Let's go with that one.

1504
01:26:29,907 --> 01:26:36,591
[Chilling guess?
Could 14358 be the number?]

1505
01:26:36,592 --> 01:26:37,887
Please let it be right!

1506
01:26:42,434 --> 01:26:45,643
14358!

1507
01:26:45,644 --> 01:26:47,180
Please let it be right!

1508
01:26:50,832 --> 01:26:54,730
[The doors are lighting up?]

1509
01:26:55,392 --> 01:26:57,313
- Can I open it?
- Try opening it.

1510
01:27:02,899 --> 01:27:04,149
[The door opens up...]

1511
01:27:04,150 --> 01:27:07,805
[And inside...]

1512
01:27:09,072 --> 01:27:10,941
[Completely wide eyed.]

1513
01:27:16,414 --> 01:27:19,618
[The door opened!]

1514
01:27:21,986 --> 01:27:25,812
[Kwang Soo guesses the correct number,
and opened the door!]

1515
01:27:25,813 --> 01:27:27,641
Come in!
Come in through the door!

1516
01:27:27,642 --> 01:27:32,480
[Even though he's afraid,
he crossed through the threshold.]

1517
01:27:32,481 --> 01:27:35,689
[Kwang Soo and Seung Gi did it!]

1518
01:27:35,690 --> 01:27:38,579
Leader Lee!
Leader Lee!

1519
01:27:43,489 --> 01:27:45,800
[Crossing back out the door
with the prize in hand!]

1520
01:27:45,801 --> 01:27:47,314
I'm the true leader!

1521
01:27:47,986 --> 01:27:50,379
- Good job, Kwang Soo.
- Good job.

1522
01:27:50,380 --> 01:27:52,879
- How did you come up with it?
- He said the answer lies within the mission.

1523
01:27:52,880 --> 01:27:55,925
So we lined up all the missions in the
order we were given the cards.

1524
01:27:55,926 --> 01:27:59,340
We couldn't come up with an answer no matter
how hard we looked at the numbers.

1525
01:27:59,341 --> 01:28:03,651
- Then our Leader Kwang all of a sudden...
- That leader would be me.

1526
01:28:04,507 --> 01:28:06,960
He looked at the mission cards
and noticed something.

1527
01:28:07,306 --> 01:28:12,688
When we just looked at the first letters,
it said, 'Plus one'.

1528
01:28:13,322 --> 01:28:15,673
Wow... I really didn't even fathom that.

1529
01:28:16,752 --> 01:28:22,731
So the 14357 that we were given
from the beginning...

1530
01:28:23,435 --> 01:28:27,294
[How did someone like him ever
figure out this riddle?]

1531
01:28:27,295 --> 01:28:30,955
So we added one to
14357 and came up with 14358.

1532
01:28:30,956 --> 01:28:34,286
[The number is 14358.]

1533
01:28:34,287 --> 01:28:36,934
The leader shines his true light
in the end.

1534
01:28:37,854 --> 01:28:40,384
This was your last?
Oh...

1535
01:28:41,280 --> 01:28:43,802
[Today is Kwang Soo's last show?]

1536
01:28:43,803 --> 01:28:47,157
[Leader Kwang wanting to shine
in his final moment...]

1537
01:28:52,078 --> 01:28:53,652
What are you guys all talking about?

1538
01:28:53,653 --> 01:28:55,708
- What are you talking about?
- Kwang Soo.

1539
01:28:55,709 --> 01:28:58,581
This was a very casual way
for you to back out of the show.

1540
01:28:59,769 --> 01:29:02,979
[Winning the mission turned into
a sudden exiting from the show?]

1541
01:29:02,980 --> 01:29:05,716
- You're leaving as a leader now.
- Watch what you say!

1542
01:29:05,717 --> 01:29:08,741
Well, there's nowhere for you
to climb now.

1543
01:29:08,742 --> 01:29:10,827
What are you talking about?

1544
01:29:12,762 --> 01:29:14,716
Then is there an opening for
a new member?

1545
01:29:14,779 --> 01:29:17,345
[Wanting to take over Giraffe's
empty spot?]

1546
01:29:17,346 --> 01:29:19,574
Bora wants to take his spot.

1547
01:29:19,575 --> 01:29:23,378
Anyways, today's winners!
Team Lee Seung Gi!

1548
01:29:23,379 --> 01:29:25,798
[Today's winner- Team Seung Gi!]
