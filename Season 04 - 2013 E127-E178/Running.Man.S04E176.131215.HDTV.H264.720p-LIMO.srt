[Popularity Men Race- Start!]

119
00:08:26,206 --> 00:08:28,801
Stop glaring at the lower rank.

120
00:08:28,802 --> 00:08:31,854
It's not right to make the actual low rank
holders to sit in the lower ranked seats.

121
00:08:32,221 --> 00:08:35,666
Then are you saying that your side is the
upper rank, and the other is the lower rank?

122
00:08:35,667 --> 00:08:38,863
- No, this is just where we're sitting.

[Is Ha Ha admitting that Jae Suk and
Gary are upper rank holders?]

125
00:08:45,874 --> 00:08:49,835
The public's opinion never changes.

126
00:08:49,836 --> 00:08:51,564
No, you don't know that.

127
00:08:51,565 --> 00:08:55,495
Listen, there's no need to even discuss that.
We're all on the same team today.

128
00:08:55,496 --> 00:08:59,038
We just need to guess the ranks correctly,
and go our own separate ways with our gold.

129
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:01,112
- Yes, you're right.
- Let's play it cool.

130
00:09:01,113 --> 00:09:03,401
- Play it cool, and say our goodbyes.
- Okay, I got it.

131
00:09:03,402 --> 00:09:05,506
We can all say our goodbyes
and go our separate ways.

132
00:09:05,507 --> 00:09:08,026
But I still don't want to be labeled
as being lower class rank.

133
00:09:08,027 --> 00:09:10,641
I'm not quite sure where I stand
in the public's opinion.

134
00:09:10,642 --> 00:09:15,053
We've got a lot of smooth talkers here,
and with this many good people here

135

there's a good chance that some of you
may not get a chance to get to talk.

136
00:09:18,563 --> 00:09:20,788
So let's all make sure that everyone
gets their chance to talk as well.

137
00:09:20,789 --> 00:09:23,855
Muzy sitting in the front seat
by himself could feel frustrated.

138
00:09:23,856 --> 00:09:26,370
So let's all make sure to include him
in our conversations.

139
00:09:26,371 --> 00:09:29,018
And let's all make sure to laugh
at each other's jokes too.

140
00:09:29,483 --> 00:09:31,638

[Good timing]

144
00:09:39,558 --> 00:09:41,394
That was good timing.

145
00:09:41,395 --> 00:09:43,554
That was perfect timing,
with the perfect one liner.

146
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:47,148
- Is Muzy...
- It's not 'Muzy'.

147
00:09:47,552 --> 00:09:51,072
[It's not 'Muzy', but it's 'Muzy'.]

148
00:09:51,073 --> 00:09:52,639
I went to some rural town recently

149
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,640
and one grandmother thought that
my name was 'Myoji'.

150
00:09:54,641 --> 00:09:56,242
[Myoji=Cemetery, graveyard.]

151
00:09:57,742 --> 00:10:00,509
- That's not your real name, is it?
- Lee Hong Li.

152
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:02,810
- Who names their kid, Muzy?
- Then is that your nickname?

153
00:10:04,391 --> 00:10:07,626
['Nickname' is the term used
on the internet.]

154
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:11,049
I have an internet nickname too.
It's 'Ramses'.

155
00:10:14,516 --> 00:10:17,528
- Why is your nickname, 'Ramses'?
- Don't you know Ramses, the son of the sun?

156
00:10:17,529 --> 00:10:19,591
You?
You're the son of the sun?

157
00:10:19,592 --> 00:10:21,520
That's right, that's me!

158
00:10:21,521 --> 00:10:23,844
Ah!
I get it now!

159
00:10:26,109 --> 00:10:29,812
[Ramses, Kwang Gyu.]

160
00:10:31,174 --> 00:10:34,083
[The men's first point of attack.]

161
00:10:34,084 --> 00:10:38,087
[Where women come to work on their figure-
The dance studio.]

162
00:10:40,711 --> 00:10:42,801
<i>Can you move a little faster?</i>

163
00:10:42,802 --> 00:10:45,021
What took you so long to get here?

164
00:10:45,022 --> 00:10:48,399
[There's always one person who lags behind-
Ramses Kwang Gyu.]

165
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:51,241
- I thought that you went home.
- What are you doing?

166
00:10:51,242 --> 00:10:54,263
[45 year old Kwang Gyu-
Another high maintenance man.]

167
00:10:54,264 --> 00:10:55,952
What are you doing?

168
00:10:56,316 --> 00:10:58,865
You need someone to do everything for you.

169
00:10:58,866 --> 00:11:02,251
You're the first person we've seen who's
even higher maintenance than Suk Jin.

170
00:11:02,252 --> 00:11:03,746
[Even more high maintenance
than Big-nosed Brother.]

171
00:11:03,747 --> 00:11:06,943
By any chance, do you know a game
called, 'Dari-Dari'?

172
00:11:06,944 --> 00:11:08,954
I have very bad legs.
(Dari= Legs)

173
00:11:09,252 --> 00:11:10,570
Why doesn't that surprise me?

174
00:11:10,571 --> 00:11:12,495
- All of you need to work together...
- Yes?

175
00:11:12,496 --> 00:11:17,006
To pick the number of legs...
I mean, guess the number of legs...

176
00:11:17,007 --> 00:11:18,623
Let's try to read correctly on
the first try.

177
00:11:20,053 --> 00:11:21,487
MC Blank.

178
00:11:21,943 --> 00:11:25,872
- You used to MC on a live show.
- I know, but this isn't a live show.

179
00:11:25,873 --> 00:11:32,044
Choose a number and work together to stand on
the same number of legs as the number chosen.

180
00:11:32,045 --> 00:11:34,223
- I see.
- So you have to lift your legs?

181
00:11:34,224 --> 00:11:35,888
[A mission that requires a sense of balance.]

182
00:11:35,889 --> 00:11:38,192
We get a hint if we succeed this, right?

183
00:11:38,193 --> 00:11:39,800
[If they succeed within three tries,
they'll earn themselves a hint.]

184
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,669
- Is there a time limit?
- 30 seconds.

185
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:45,059
- Yes, you must do it within 30 seconds.
- 30 seconds is plenty for a game like this.

186
00:11:45,118 --> 00:11:48,147
[Excuse me?]

187
00:11:48,148 --> 00:11:49,559
What kind of a rule is that?

188
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,465
There are certain sets of rules that
all variety show hosts and players

189
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,936
in the world meet up
every four years to decide on.

190
00:11:53,936 --> 00:11:56,217
It's a set of rules determined by
all the variety show hosts.

191
00:11:56,218 --> 00:11:59,413
- These rules are determined every four years.
- Let's expand it to 35 seconds next time.

192
00:11:59,673 --> 00:12:02,874
We can all discuss if that's what we
want to do at the next meeting.

193
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:06,813
You must finish within 30 seconds,
and must stay in that position for 5 seconds.

194
00:12:06,814 --> 00:12:08,978
Okay, let's do this and
guess the correct rank of popularity.

195
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:11,693
Then, we can win this race against the writers
and all win our own individual gold prize.

196
00:12:11,694 --> 00:12:14,223
Then we can all say goodbye
and go our separate ways.

197
00:12:14,626 --> 00:12:16,932
[Let's play it cool.]

198
00:12:16,933 --> 00:12:19,390
- Are we going to start now?
- Yes, you come in.

199
00:12:19,391 --> 00:12:20,741
- What is this?
- Come in.

200
00:12:20,742 --> 00:12:22,078
- What's coming in?
- What is he doing?

201
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:23,893
What is that?

202
00:12:26,836 --> 00:12:29,469
[The game must be played on top
of the acupuncture mat.]

203
00:12:31,042 --> 00:12:32,563
No way!

204
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:36,159
We should agree to eliminate the use of
acupuncture mats at the next meeting.

205
00:12:37,611 --> 00:12:40,144
Is this being sponsored or something?

206
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:44,395
[No, this acupuncture mat is more precious
to a variety show than any sponsorship.]

207
00:12:44,396 --> 00:12:46,855
- This is driving me crazy.
- This is really painful.

208
00:12:46,856 --> 00:12:49,722
<i>Even if you have the popularity,
it's of no use without your health.</i>

209
00:12:49,723 --> 00:12:53,315
- Just stay quiet and don't say anything.
- Seriously, just be quiet!

210
00:12:53,316 --> 00:12:55,613
But this really is good for your health.

211
00:12:55,614 --> 00:12:58,191
There are a ton of other things that are
good for your health than this.

212
00:12:58,192 --> 00:13:01,408
[But other things aren't as entertaining...]

213
00:13:01,409 --> 00:13:03,112
<i>Everyone must take off their socks.</i>

214
00:13:03,113 --> 00:13:04,973
Ugh, this mat really hurts.

215
00:13:04,974 --> 00:13:07,267
[Preparing to face the acupuncture mat
without their socks.]

216
00:13:08,767 --> 00:13:12,281
We need to pick the number first,
so someone must step up and do that.

217
00:13:12,282 --> 00:13:14,690
[Kwang Gyu steps up for the group,
and picks the numbered card.]

218
00:13:15,052 --> 00:13:16,906
- Please, please.
- Show your number to the camera.

219
00:13:18,054 --> 00:13:20,650
- What is it?
- It's not a two or a three, is it?

220
00:13:20,651 --> 00:13:21,867
[Picks the number 'Two'.]

221
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:26,040
[How are 11 people to stand
on only two legs?]

222
00:13:26,592 --> 00:13:32,382
What if we all stand on our heads,
and lean our feet on the one person standing?

223
00:13:33,385 --> 00:13:37,149
- Everyone stand upside down but one person?
- Like a bridge?

224
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:40,088
- That's good.
- That plan could work.

225
00:13:40,446 --> 00:13:43,811
How about two people stand on one foot each,
and the rest stand upside down on their heads?

226
00:13:43,812 --> 00:13:46,237
- That's sound good.
- I think that's a great idea.

227
00:13:47,474 --> 00:13:50,049
Why doesn't Ki Ha be one and
hold one of the lines steady?

228
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:53,040
- We can do it in a double line.
- Then let's figure out who'll do what.

229
00:13:53,706 --> 00:13:56,764
- Then everyone else go behind Ki Ha.
- It's a good plan, but don't get angry.

230
00:13:56,765 --> 00:13:58,855
I'm not getting angry at all.

231
00:14:00,633 --> 00:14:01,721
I'm scared.

232
00:14:02,261 --> 00:14:06,857
[Loud voiced coaching making some of
the first time guests nervous.]

233
00:14:07,905 --> 00:14:09,818
- Just talk more calmly.
- We're just strategizing right now.

234
00:14:09,819 --> 00:14:12,733
Ki and to Suk Jin will be the first line.

235
00:14:12,734 --> 00:14:15,654
Jong Kook to Kwang Gyu
will be the second line.

236
00:14:15,655 --> 00:14:17,637
Everyone get yourselves together!

237
00:14:18,709 --> 00:14:20,950
Let's all quiet down!

238
00:14:21,711 --> 00:14:24,949
[Icon of intellect finally explodes.]

239
00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:28,271
- Scream out loud, Ki Ha!
- I really am sorry for this.

240
00:14:30,339 --> 00:14:32,793
Make some noise, you fool!

241
00:14:34,137 --> 00:14:37,105
[Even Ki Ha is starting to loosen up,
and get into the spirit of things.]

242
00:14:37,552 --> 00:14:41,153
Look at how Hyun Moo looks like he's aged
some already before the game even started.

243
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:43,584
[Hyun Moo having aged noticeably since
before their strategizing started.]

244
00:14:43,585 --> 00:14:48,047
- This is how we normally talk.
- You've got a five o'clock shadow too.

245
00:14:48,549 --> 00:14:51,008
[His five o'clock shadow is darkening
right before our very own eyes.]

246
00:14:53,382 --> 00:14:56,322
- This is just the beginning.
- We've got the whole day ahead of us.

247
00:14:56,323 --> 00:14:58,951
Okay, we will start with your
first attempt.

248
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,619
[Heavier the weight of the legs,
the heavier the pain of agony.]

249
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:15,024
[Where in the world am I?]

250
00:15:18,955 --> 00:15:20,756
[Almost seems to have it...]

251
00:15:23,604 --> 00:15:25,634
[Then Kwang Gyu's legs give out on him.]

252
00:15:25,635 --> 00:15:27,123
What's wrong with you?

253
00:15:30,998 --> 00:15:33,166
[Not much time left on the clock!]

254
00:15:33,167 --> 00:15:34,606
Put your legs up!

255
00:15:35,698 --> 00:15:38,154
[Oh... he's got it!]

256
00:15:40,038 --> 00:15:44,041
[Now they must stay in this position for
five full seconds in order to succeed!]

257
00:15:47,885 --> 00:15:51,454
[Will they succeed?]

258
00:15:57,297 --> 00:15:58,623
Success!

259
00:16:00,175 --> 00:16:03,035
[Succeeds in withstanding five seconds
on only two legs!]

260
00:16:06,783 --> 00:16:10,291
[Screams of agony heard from everyone.]

261
00:16:16,781 --> 00:16:18,780
Stop coming up with these sort of games!

262
00:16:21,828 --> 00:16:23,714
We did it, everyone.

263
00:16:23,715 --> 00:16:26,506
[A success earned through
their harmonious teamwork.]

264
00:16:28,435 --> 00:16:32,468
I applaud you on your great teamwork,
and you've earned yourselves a hint.

265
00:16:32,469 --> 00:16:34,503
[Earned themselves a hint on the
order of popularity rank.]

266
00:16:34,504 --> 00:16:36,602
It had better be a good hint.

267
00:16:36,603 --> 00:16:38,659
I've got indentations all over my hands.

268
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:41,587
You just need your fingertips to
play the piano, so you'll be fine.

269
00:16:43,809 --> 00:16:46,698
How am I supposed to play with my fingertips
without the use of my hands?

270
00:16:46,699 --> 00:16:48,216
[So the hands just get in the way?]

271
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:52,502
I would like to propose something here.

272
00:16:52,503 --> 00:16:55,010
You've already earned yourselves
your first hint.

273
00:16:55,185 --> 00:16:58,322
- But by increasing the level of difficulty...
- No, forget it.

274
00:16:58,323 --> 00:17:00,509
How can it get more difficult
than two legs?

275
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:01,919
Doing it on one leg.

276
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,343
[Offering two additional hints if they can
do it only on one leg.]

277
00:17:04,344 --> 00:17:05,622
You're right.
We could do it in the shape of a 'V'.

278
00:17:05,623 --> 00:17:08,324
Like we've done before, the person at the end
would have to lift up one of his leg.

279
00:17:08,325 --> 00:17:10,600
You only get one chance.

280
00:17:10,601 --> 00:17:13,924
And we don't have to lift up both of
our legs right from the get-go.

281
00:17:13,925 --> 00:17:17,845
Since we're all playing in a group race,
how about you lower your voice a bit?

282
00:17:17,846 --> 00:17:20,021
- I'm sorry.
- You sound like you're angry at me.

283
00:17:20,022 --> 00:17:23,296
Let's ask others for their opinion.
What do you think of this, Hyun Moo?

284
00:17:23,297 --> 00:17:25,075
- Excuse me?
- Next person if you don't have an opinion.

285
00:17:25,076 --> 00:17:27,324
- No, that's not what I was saying.
- He said he'll be back in 60 seconds.

286
00:17:27,854 --> 00:17:29,398
That's not my line.

287
00:17:31,566 --> 00:17:34,834
[That line belongs to this man.]

288
00:17:34,835 --> 00:17:37,126
[Hyun Moo's line is,
'We'll be back after these messages.']

289
00:17:37,127 --> 00:17:39,072
- What are your thoughts, Kwang Gyu?
- Me?

290
00:17:39,073 --> 00:17:41,928
He said he'll just go along
with the crowd.

291
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:45,521
- When we do this...
- We heard you!

292
00:17:46,113 --> 00:17:48,213
[Ah, the stress!]

293
00:17:48,214 --> 00:17:50,254
Okay, we're going to start.

294
00:17:50,255 --> 00:17:51,732
[MC Blank stepping up to put
all the men back in line.]

295
00:17:51,733 --> 00:17:52,894
Hey!

296
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:54,507
You, be quiet!

297
00:17:55,602 --> 00:17:58,260
- Be quiet and let me talk!
- Sorry.

298
00:17:58,488 --> 00:18:01,564
[Live broadcast specialist,
MC Blank explodes.]

299
00:18:01,565 --> 00:18:03,824
- Our MC is very angry right now.
- Yes, I'm sorry.

300
00:18:04,726 --> 00:18:06,599
[What am I doing here?]

301
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,349
Are you done strategizing?

302
00:18:08,903 --> 00:18:11,570
One, two, three!
Start!

303
00:18:11,571 --> 00:18:14,002
[One legged challenge-  Start!]

304
00:18:18,439 --> 00:18:22,730
[The plan is to get in a v-shaped formation,
then put their weight on Kkuk's shoulders.]

305
00:18:22,731 --> 00:18:24,688
Hurry it up!

306
00:18:28,579 --> 00:18:32,440
[Everyone's already starting to quake.]

307
00:18:33,637 --> 00:18:36,935
[They're building and getting into formation
much faster than the previous time.]

308
00:18:36,936 --> 00:18:39,713
[It's now up to Mr. Capable and
his ability to endure their weight...]

309
00:18:41,095 --> 00:18:42,850
Put them up!

310
00:18:45,307 --> 00:18:47,848
[All the men lift up
the other remaining legs...]

311
00:18:47,849 --> 00:18:52,126
[Mr. Capable must endure the weight of
all ten men on just one foot.]

312
00:18:56,063 --> 00:18:58,970
[Only one foot left grounded!]

313
00:19:03,074 --> 00:19:06,481
[Must endure this position for five seconds.]

314
00:19:11,425 --> 00:19:13,865
[Just one more second...]

315
00:19:15,556 --> 00:19:16,907
Success!

316
00:19:19,103 --> 00:19:21,397
[They did it!]

317
00:19:21,398 --> 00:19:23,097
[Point of collapsing.]

318
00:19:29,677 --> 00:19:32,569
[You'd think they won first place in
some world competition.]

319
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:34,992
[An ocean of tears.]

320
00:19:36,543 --> 00:19:40,019
[An emotional victory.]

321
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:44,070
You've won yourselves a total
of three hints.

322
00:19:44,071 --> 00:19:46,374
You may choose three hints
out of this container.

323
00:19:47,785 --> 00:19:49,678
- How about Ki Ha?
- Pick one, Ki Ha.

324
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:51,783
[Ki Ha to pick the first hint.]

325
00:19:52,247 --> 00:19:53,754
<i>Please show your hint to the camera.</i>

326
00:19:55,418 --> 00:19:57,675
- A child drawing hint?
- What's a 'child drawing hint'?

327
00:19:57,676 --> 00:19:59,448
- Kwang Gyu can pick the next one.
- Go on and pick.

328
00:19:59,878 --> 00:20:01,941
- No, Hyun Moo can pick.
- No, the father can pick.

329
00:20:01,942 --> 00:20:03,577
How am I your father?

330
00:20:03,578 --> 00:20:05,250
I just picked one.

331
00:20:05,251 --> 00:20:08,450
[Yoo Hyuk steals their chance while
they were bickering.]

332
00:20:09,384 --> 00:20:13,135
- Intermediate hint.
- First one is a child's drawing.

333
00:20:13,136 --> 00:20:16,990
[First hint is a child's drawing of five
different people.]

334
00:20:16,991 --> 00:20:19,990
[The people in these drawings are of those
in 7th through 11th ranking positions.]

335
00:20:19,991 --> 00:20:21,913
We're going to move on to
the next location.

336
00:20:21,914 --> 00:20:24,157
Do you by any chance have any
medicated patches?

337
00:20:28,583 --> 00:20:31,239
[Discussing the drawing in the car.]

338
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,713
I think you're right.
I think it's Kwang Gyu.

339
00:20:32,714 --> 00:20:34,658
[They're sure that this one is Kwang Gyu?]

340
00:20:34,659 --> 00:20:36,611
- Look at the hair.
- It's a cute drawing.

341
00:20:36,612 --> 00:20:38,966
[And mysterious brown colored hair.]

342
00:20:38,967 --> 00:20:40,907
- Could it be Hyun Moo?
- It looks like Hyun Moo.

343
00:20:40,908 --> 00:20:42,778
Or is it, Ki Ha?

344
00:20:42,779 --> 00:20:45,366
- But the hair is colored.
- I've never colored my hair.

345
00:20:45,367 --> 00:20:47,237
He says he's never colored his hair,
but I've colored my hair before.

346
00:20:47,762 --> 00:20:50,536
- This is 100% Muzy.
- Why is that one Muzy?

347
00:20:50,537 --> 00:20:53,482
[Anyone can see that this one is Muzy.]

348
00:20:53,483 --> 00:20:55,373
What's the other hint in
the envelope?

349
00:20:55,374 --> 00:20:57,673
[They also received two intermediate hints
in an envelope.]

350
00:20:57,674 --> 00:21:00,402
<i>[Lee Juck is one rank above
Kim Jong Kook.]</i>

351
00:21:00,403 --> 00:21:03,051
I beat Kim Jong Kook!

352
00:21:04,884 --> 00:21:06,880
[No Way]

353
00:21:06,881 --> 00:21:08,312
There's another one.

354
00:21:09,016 --> 00:21:12,398
<i>[3rd, 6th, and 10th place holders
were born in the 80's.]</i>

355
00:21:12,399 --> 00:21:14,495
- Who all were born in the 80's?
- Raise your hands.

356
00:21:14,496 --> 00:21:19,219
[Muzy- '81; Ki Ha- '82; Kwang Soo- '85.]

357
00:21:19,219 --> 00:21:22,308
- Tenth place.
- No, it's not him.

358
00:21:22,309 --> 00:21:25,485
- I don't think it's him.
- I think I'm in tenth place.

359
00:21:25,486 --> 00:21:29,044
The reason being, Muzy's one of the
pictures that the kids drew.

360
00:21:29,045 --> 00:21:31,033
[Muzy's picture was one of the drawings
that the children drew...]

361
00:21:31,034 --> 00:21:34,409
[Then Muzy is the 10th place holder?]

362
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:35,992
What about this one?
What kind of clothing is this?

363
00:21:35,993 --> 00:21:38,623
[And another picture that may be
indicating Big-nosed Brother.]

364
00:21:38,624 --> 00:21:41,770
- That does look like you though.
- But look at how fat the face is.

365
00:21:42,668 --> 00:21:44,133
You are chubby, Suk Jin.

366
00:21:50,003 --> 00:21:51,609
Aren't there any pictures of you
during a chubby phase?

367
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:54,604
This hint says that this person is
one rank above Kim Jong Kook.

368
00:21:54,605 --> 00:21:57,469
Which means that if that person is drawn,
then Jong Kook has to be one of these too.

369
00:21:57,470 --> 00:22:00,073
- That's right.
- But we all agree that Jong Kook's not here.

370
00:22:00,074 --> 00:22:03,986
[Since there's no picture of Jong Kook, then
Lee Juck and Jong Kook are higher in rank.]

371
00:22:03,987 --> 00:22:05,832
Which means that I have to be in
the top four ranking positions.

372
00:22:05,833 --> 00:22:07,347
According to these clues.

373
00:22:07,348 --> 00:22:09,747
Since I'm one rank above Jong Kook,
then it means I'm one of the top four.

374
00:22:09,748 --> 00:22:12,676
You have to think about winning the game,
not gloating that you're above me in rank.

375
00:22:12,677 --> 00:22:16,486
[Winning the game aside, Lee Juck
is just happy to have beaten Jong Kook]

376
00:22:16,573 --> 00:22:18,410
Never mind all that.
We're all on the same team.

377
00:22:18,934 --> 00:22:21,060
[Will the true ranking of their popularity
be the same as their guesses?]

378
00:22:22,506 --> 00:22:26,790
[Their second target location is...]

379
00:22:26,791 --> 00:22:32,129
[The place where all beauty begins!
A beauty salon.]

380
00:22:35,031 --> 00:22:38,522
[Huh? Could this be a quiz
of some sorts?]

381
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:43,566
[Seoul University graduate, Lee Juck and Ki Ha
with Hyun Moo, a graduate from Y University.]

382
00:22:43,567 --> 00:22:45,775
Hyun Moo told me that he has never
failed a single exam in his life.

383
00:22:46,005 --> 00:22:48,120
- Is everyone seated?
- Yes.

384
00:22:48,121 --> 00:22:49,991
Here's your second mission.

385
00:22:49,992 --> 00:22:51,200
[Popularity Race- Second mission!]

386
00:22:51,235 --> 00:22:55,379
Even though looks are very important,
intelligence is just as important.

387
00:22:55,934 --> 00:22:58,861
- Yes, of course it is.
- That's why we've prepared this mission.

388
00:22:58,862 --> 00:23:01,523
Running Academic Quiz.

389
00:23:01,524 --> 00:23:03,581
[Running Academic Quiz!]

390
00:23:09,572 --> 00:23:14,425
Do you all see the board with different
categories and values in front of you?

391
00:23:15,404 --> 00:23:18,509
You all will be taking turns to
answer the questions on this board.

392
00:23:18,544 --> 00:23:23,724
The total number of points earned with
all eleven members playing

393
00:23:23,725 --> 00:23:25,451
must be at least 30 points.

394
00:23:25,452 --> 00:23:28,172
[Each of them must participate in the quiz
to get 30 points or more to succeed.]

395
00:23:28,173 --> 00:23:31,228
Ha Ha's good at nonsense and
entertainment questions.

396
00:23:31,229 --> 00:23:33,330
- Jae Suk's good with common sense questions.
- Gary's good with women's feelings.

397
00:23:33,331 --> 00:23:35,144
Yeah, Gary's good with women's feelings.

398
00:23:36,727 --> 00:23:41,177
Now that I look at the different categories,
I realize that we need to work together on it.

399
00:23:41,178 --> 00:23:43,408
- Which category are you good at, Kwang Gyu?
- Me?

400
00:23:43,409 --> 00:23:44,820
Women's feelings?

401
00:23:44,821 --> 00:23:46,315
[Kwang Gyu's category of expertise-
Women's feelings?]

402
00:23:47,192 --> 00:23:49,288
- What about you, Muzy?
- Relationship?

403
00:23:49,289 --> 00:23:50,808
- You're good with relationships?
- Yes, relationships.

404
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:53,643
How about you?

405
00:23:53,644 --> 00:23:56,058
- Ah, you mean, Lee Juck?
- Yes, Lee Juck.

406
00:23:56,059 --> 00:23:58,915
- How about SAT questions?
- Okay, SAT questions!

407
00:23:59,419 --> 00:24:01,361
You can take the SAT questions.

408
00:24:01,362 --> 00:24:04,838
- I'm of the academic testing era.
- What about Ki Ha?

409
00:24:04,839 --> 00:24:06,553
['82 born Ki Ha to take charge of
the SAT questions.]

410
00:24:06,554 --> 00:24:08,625
- Can't I do 'Women's feelings'?
- No, you take the SAT questions.

411
00:24:08,626 --> 00:24:10,743
Why is everyone trying to take
the Women's Feelings category?

412
00:24:10,744 --> 00:24:13,790
Hyun Moo can help with the SAT category.
You can do that, right?

413
00:24:14,368 --> 00:24:16,515
[Hyun Moo guaranteeing that he could
sweep the Entertainment category.]

414
00:24:16,899 --> 00:24:19,448
If you have scored more than 30 points
by the end of the first round...

415
00:24:19,449 --> 00:24:22,060
you can earn yourselves
a total of three hints.

416
00:24:22,061 --> 00:24:23,357
We understand.

417
00:24:23,358 --> 00:24:27,348
- Decide who will go first.
- We'll just go in the order we're sitting.

418
00:24:27,349 --> 00:24:30,087
- No, not in that order.
- I'll go first.

419
00:24:31,674 --> 00:24:34,627
[First one up- Jang Ki Ha.]

420
00:24:34,628 --> 00:24:37,307
[He looks as though he's eyeing
the high score questions from off the bat.]

421
00:24:37,873 --> 00:24:39,295
Which question would you like?

422
00:24:39,676 --> 00:24:41,695
You really want me to go for
the SAT questions?

423
00:24:41,696 --> 00:24:44,441
[He's really going for the five point
SAT question?]

424
00:24:44,442 --> 00:24:45,930
SAT question for five points.

425
00:24:48,514 --> 00:24:50,221
Jang Ki Ha, fighting!

426
00:24:50,985 --> 00:24:53,244
[Jang Ki Ha, fighting!]

427
00:24:53,245 --> 00:24:55,742
- We really need to get this.
- Five point questions are going to be hard.

428
00:24:55,743 --> 00:24:59,435
<i>You have chosen an SAT question
for five points.</i>

429
00:25:01,871 --> 00:25:04,352
Just the fact that he can even go for that
question makes me feel envious.

430
00:25:04,353 --> 00:25:07,092
<i>From the 2011 college entrance exam.</i>

431
00:25:07,442 --> 00:25:11,348
<i>This is a question right out
of the 2011 entrance exam.</i>

432
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:13,871
<i>It's an English listening evaluation
question.</i>

433
00:25:16,811 --> 00:25:19,444
- We're going to get those five points!
- He's good at speaking English, isn't he?

434
00:25:19,572 --> 00:25:21,866
I wasn't in KATUSA,
but I was an interpreter.

435
00:25:22,053 --> 00:25:25,649
[Wow! He was an interpreter for the army?
A position which requires fluency in English?]

436
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:29,399
- We're going to win those five points!
- It's already in the bag!

437
00:25:31,899 --> 00:25:33,473
[The anxiety level is even higher.]

438
00:25:33,474 --> 00:25:37,500
- If anyone from the back gives any hints...
- That is not going to happen.

439
00:25:37,501 --> 00:25:40,562
- You don't have to worry about that!
- All I know is, 'Yes' or 'No'.

440
00:25:41,687 --> 00:25:42,940
I get nauseous just from thinking
about speaking English.

441
00:25:42,941 --> 00:25:45,967
[How is that even possible?]

442
00:25:47,606 --> 00:25:49,696
<i>Listen to the following conversation.</i>

443
00:25:49,697 --> 00:25:53,780
<i>From the price of the item that
the man orders...</i>

444
00:25:54,555 --> 00:25:59,817
<i>Figure out how much his monthly payment
will be and tell us what that amount is.</i>

445
00:25:59,818 --> 00:26:02,065
- That's a tough question.
- How is he going to figure that out?

446
00:26:02,066 --> 00:26:04,423
- Let me read it to you again.
- I didn't get what he said.

447
00:26:04,424 --> 00:26:07,190
I don't even understand what
the question is.

448
00:26:07,191 --> 00:26:08,428
<i>Listen to the following conversation.</i>

449
00:26:08,777 --> 00:26:11,353
<i>From the price of the item that
the man orders...</i>

450
00:26:11,354 --> 00:26:14,139
<i>Figure out how much his monthly payment
will be and tell us what that amount is.</i>

451
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:16,919
Figure out the amount of the monthly payment
from the price of the item the man orders.

452
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:19,428
- Monthly?
- Amount of the monthly payment.

453
00:26:19,429 --> 00:26:20,927
<i>I'll play the recording now.</i>

454
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:23,211
<i>Everyone must remain quiet.
Listen carefully.</i>

455
00:26:25,274 --> 00:26:26,724
It's a phone call.

456
00:26:27,953 --> 00:26:30,502
<i>Hello?
Roger's office supplies.</i>

457
00:26:30,503 --> 00:26:32,573
<i>Would you like to place an order?</i>

458
00:26:32,574 --> 00:26:35,163
<i>Yes, I'd like to order a fax machine.</i>

459
00:26:35,602 --> 00:26:39,838
<i>- May I have the model number please?
- It's FX1000.</i>

460
00:26:40,286 --> 00:26:43,878
<i>Alright.
That model is $150.</i>

461
00:26:43,879 --> 00:26:46,358
<i>And I'd also like to order a scanner.</i>

462
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:51,133
<i>That's $250.
Would you like to order anything else?</i>

463
00:26:51,134 --> 00:26:53,375
<i>No, that's all for today.</i>

464
00:26:53,376 --> 00:26:58,965
<i>Then your total comes to $400.
Do you have any discount coupons?</i>

465
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,816
<i>Yes, I have a special
10% discount coupon.</i>

466
00:27:02,817 --> 00:27:06,006
<i>Okay, we'll apply that to your order.</i>

467
00:27:06,007 --> 00:27:10,943
<i>Would you like to take advantage of our
three or six month installment payment plan?</i>

468
00:27:10,944 --> 00:27:12,674
<i>It's interest free.</i>

469
00:27:12,675 --> 00:27:15,617
<i>I'll pay using
the three month installment plan.</i>

470
00:27:18,714 --> 00:27:20,225
- That was really long.
- That was long.

471
00:27:20,225 --> 00:27:22,471
I recognized five of the words.

472
00:27:23,003 --> 00:27:26,882
The English portion was hard enough,
but I was lost after the math portion.

473
00:27:26,883 --> 00:27:30,293
- It's a combination of English and math.
- That's really tough.

474
00:27:30,294 --> 00:27:33,889
[Just what is the dollar amount of
the man's monthly payment?]

475
00:27:33,890 --> 00:27:35,805
<i>Here's the question one more time.
You've listened to the conversation, right?</i>

476
00:27:35,806 --> 00:27:40,651
<i>What is the monthly payment amount
for the items that the man ordered?</i>

477
00:27:40,652 --> 00:27:42,477
- I think I know the answer.
- Hyun Moo says he knows.

478
00:27:42,478 --> 00:27:43,758
<i>You have five seconds to answer.</i>

479
00:27:43,759 --> 00:27:47,003
<i>Five, four...</i>

480
00:27:49,269 --> 00:27:50,803
$120.

481
00:27:50,804 --> 00:27:52,225
$120.

482
00:27:54,174 --> 00:28:01,968
[Ki Ha's answer is, $120.
Did he get the right answer?]

483
00:28:01,969 --> 00:28:03,563
[Correct answer]

484
00:28:03,564 --> 00:28:06,277
[SAT question for five points-
Jang Ki Ha gets the correct answer!]

485
00:28:08,575 --> 00:28:10,679
[That was so cool.]

486
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:14,199
[Gets the national hero treatment.]

487
00:28:18,174 --> 00:28:20,783
[Can only be envious...]

488
00:28:20,784 --> 00:28:24,431
- That was pretty sexy.
- How did you come up with $120?

489
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:29,507
I added up the two items that were worth
$150, and $250 respectively.

490
00:28:29,508 --> 00:28:33,943
Then he used his 10% coupon,
which brought it down to $360.

491
00:28:33,944 --> 00:28:37,951
Then he got three month installment at
no interest, which made it $120.

492
00:28:37,952 --> 00:28:41,599
[That's how the answer came to be $120.]

493
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,926
- I thought it was going to be $125.
- That's amazing.

494
00:28:45,130 --> 00:28:47,592
[Whatever...]

495
00:28:47,593 --> 00:28:53,583
<i>That was a three point question in the foreign
language portion of 2011 entrance exam.</i>

496
00:28:53,584 --> 00:28:55,389
[A high score question from
2011 college entrance exam!]

497
00:28:55,390 --> 00:28:59,903
[He just earned themselves five points
for their total of 30 points!]

498
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:02,782
- He totally earned my respect just now.
- Now that we've earned five points...

499
00:29:02,783 --> 00:29:04,985
- Go with another hard one!
- Go for another five pointer!

500
00:29:05,214 --> 00:29:08,357
[Jae Suk is riding the winning streak,
and going for the common sense category.]

501
00:29:08,358 --> 00:29:10,651
- Just keep riding this wave.
- Okay, a five point question!

502
00:29:14,166 --> 00:29:16,523
- I should've had that question.
- Don't blame me even if I get it wrong.

503
00:29:18,698 --> 00:29:21,935
- Let's just keep going for the five pointers.
- I'll try my best to get it right.

504
00:29:21,936 --> 00:29:23,664
[If Jae Suk gets it right too, then
that's ten points from only two people!]

505
00:29:23,664 --> 00:29:24,709
Let's go.

506
00:29:25,771 --> 00:29:28,646
<i>This question...
is a terminology question.</i>

507
00:29:28,647 --> 00:29:30,443
- Terminology.
- He's really good at things like that.

508
00:29:30,444 --> 00:29:32,571
- Jae Suk reads the newspaper every morning.
- Come on, Jae Suk.

509
00:29:32,572 --> 00:29:34,193
I've even seen him reading
ancient Korean text.

510
00:29:34,194 --> 00:29:36,769
Come on, Yoo Jae Suk.
Let's make some headlines!

511
00:29:38,854 --> 00:29:42,907
- How is this going to make any headlines?
- You never know.

512
00:29:42,908 --> 00:29:45,206
Come on, Yoo Jae Suk.
Let's see what you can do.

513
00:29:45,207 --> 00:29:46,923
- Let's do this!
- Here's your question.

514
00:29:46,924 --> 00:29:48,648
Let's see how deep his knowledge is.

515
00:29:48,649 --> 00:29:51,414
- What is there that Yoo Jae Suk doesn't know?
- A man with an endless wealth of knowledge.

516
00:29:51,415 --> 00:29:54,015
- Yoo Jae Suk's intelligence.
- Keep it down!

517
00:29:54,971 --> 00:29:56,270
<i>Here's your question.</i>

518
00:29:56,606 --> 00:29:58,995
<i>In a stock market...</i>

519
00:29:58,996 --> 00:30:02,264
That's my question!
I should've had that question!

520
00:30:02,265 --> 00:30:03,703
Seriously!

521
00:30:03,704 --> 00:30:07,700
<i>If the stock takes a sudden plunge,
or a sudden surge in value...</i>

522
00:30:08,010 --> 00:30:11,781
<i>What do you call the system that puts a
halt on stock sales in those instances?</i>

523
00:30:11,782 --> 00:30:13,655
- You know that one, right?
- I know this one!

524
00:30:13,656 --> 00:30:18,072
- Please, get it right!
- Come on, I know this one.

525
00:30:18,759 --> 00:30:21,168
- You know this.
- I'm a little unsure about my answer.

526
00:30:21,169 --> 00:30:22,595
The answer is...

527
00:30:23,244 --> 00:30:26,492
- Please!
- Think about it coming to a stop.

528
00:30:28,751 --> 00:30:31,600
I think... it's called 'The circuit break'.

529
00:30:31,601 --> 00:30:34,088
I think... it's called 'The circuit break'.

530
00:30:35,715 --> 00:30:37,570
- Is that right?
- Is that the answer?

531
00:30:37,571 --> 00:30:39,900
- That's right, isn't it?
- Circuit break?

532
00:30:39,901 --> 00:30:42,599
[Jae Suk is saying that it's called,
Circuit break...]

533
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,042
Circuit break.

534
00:30:44,043 --> 00:30:46,611
That was good pronunciation.

535
00:30:48,005 --> 00:30:49,762
Circuit break.

536
00:30:52,003 --> 00:30:53,406
<i>That was for five points.</i>

537
00:30:54,510 --> 00:30:56,627
[Correct answer]

538
00:30:56,628 --> 00:30:58,780
[Hooray!]

539
00:30:58,781 --> 00:31:02,117
[Yoo Jae Suk gets the correct answer!]

540
00:31:06,023 --> 00:31:07,843
He's good at everything he does.

541
00:31:12,324 --> 00:31:16,333
<i>'Circuit breaker' and
'Circuit break' are both very similar.</i>

542
00:31:16,334 --> 00:31:19,343
<i>So we've decided to give you a break,
and count it as being a correct answer.</i>

543
00:31:20,927 --> 00:31:22,941
[Already at ten points!]

544
00:31:22,942 --> 00:31:24,706
- How about Lee Juck takes his turn?
- Okay, Lee Juck.

545
00:31:24,707 --> 00:31:29,473
[Time for Lee Juck to take the hot seat!]

546
00:31:29,474 --> 00:31:31,197
How about 'People' for three points?

547
00:31:31,198 --> 00:31:33,014
- Should I go with 'People'?
- Go for the four pointer.

548
00:31:33,015 --> 00:31:34,819
- People for four points?
- People for four points.

549
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:36,471
[People for four points!]

550
00:31:37,586 --> 00:31:40,480
- I feel so confident about this.
- We've been doing so well!

551
00:31:40,481 --> 00:31:43,653
This really feels like
some sort of a quiz show.

552
00:31:43,654 --> 00:31:45,696
[Both the questions and the contestants make
this mission feel like a real quiz show!]

553
00:31:45,696 --> 00:31:48,840
<i>The keyword is... Economics.</i>

554
00:31:48,841 --> 00:31:51,704
- You can do this, Lee Juck!
- It's got to be an economist.

555
00:31:51,705 --> 00:31:53,424
[They're predicting that it's about
some economist.]

556
00:31:54,397 --> 00:31:56,593
<i>As the founding father of
principles of economy...</i>

557
00:31:57,298 --> 00:32:03,875
<i>This man said that the nation is an invisible
hand in the economic market.</i>

558
00:32:04,827 --> 00:32:06,609
- You can't see his hand?
- You know this, right?

559
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,704
You know this, right, Lee Juck?

560
00:32:14,314 --> 00:32:15,607
<i>You have five seconds.</i>

561
00:32:16,333 --> 00:32:19,404
- Five, four, three...
- Adam Smith!

562
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:21,936
Adam Smith!

563
00:32:23,515 --> 00:32:25,674
[Correct answer]

564
00:32:25,675 --> 00:32:29,092
[Lee Juck gets the correct answer!]

565
00:32:29,093 --> 00:32:32,869
[A very simple question for Lee Juck!]

566
00:32:32,870 --> 00:32:35,803
- Adam Smith!
- How did you get that answer?

567
00:32:37,763 --> 00:32:40,919
[The team has already
earned themselves 14 points!]

568
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,564
Why doesn't Suk Jin go next,
and I'll go after him?

569
00:32:43,565 --> 00:32:46,179
- Okay, Suk Jin.
- Go with something that you're sure about.

570
00:32:46,674 --> 00:32:49,232
Go with 'History', Suk Jin.
Take History.

571
00:32:49,891 --> 00:32:53,094
- Suk Jin's good at this.
- Gam-oh-kyung-jang, 1894!

572
00:32:53,095 --> 00:32:56,888
[What?
How can this be?]

573
00:32:56,889 --> 00:33:00,366
[Even though we don't know if it's right,
he shouted out the answer with confidence!]

574
00:33:00,367 --> 00:33:02,345
- Ji Suk Jin!
- History for five points.

575
00:33:02,346 --> 00:33:04,317
Go for the five pointer!
Go with history for five points.

576
00:33:04,318 --> 00:33:06,956
- I'll take history for five points.
- I think that's going to be too hard.

577
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:10,368
- You can do this, Suk Jin.
- A round of applause!

578
00:33:12,779 --> 00:33:15,453
- He's won the Star Golden Bell before.
- You're right, he has.

579
00:33:15,454 --> 00:33:17,643
- Really?
- Yes, he's won the Golden Bell before.

580
00:33:17,644 --> 00:33:20,239
[Now that we think about it,
he's done that for six years in a row!]

581
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,136
<i>The keyword for your question is...</i>

582
00:33:23,152 --> 00:33:25,486
- Person?
- Our country's beginning.

583
00:33:25,487 --> 00:33:27,710
- He likes things like that.
- This is good.

584
00:33:27,711 --> 00:33:31,582
- He likes questions like this.
- You know your history, don't you?

585
00:33:31,583 --> 00:33:34,235
<i>Here's your question.</i>

586
00:33:35,257 --> 00:33:38,091
<i>Our country's very first book of poems
written in the Korean language...</i>

587
00:33:39,227 --> 00:33:41,614
- You know this one, Suk Jin.
- That's an easy one!

588
00:33:41,615 --> 00:33:42,719
Is that the question?

589
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,675
<i>Was 'The Legend of Hong Gil Dong'.</i>

590
00:33:44,906 --> 00:33:46,723
- I didn't know that.
- I knew that one.

591
00:33:46,724 --> 00:33:51,120
<i>Then what is the first book of poetry written
in Chinese characters from our country?</i>

592
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:53,292
- I don't know this one.
- I have no idea what it is.

593
00:33:55,690 --> 00:33:57,641
<i>I'll give you a hint.</i>

594
00:33:58,586 --> 00:34:01,456
- It's three words, right?
- No, it's four words.

595
00:34:01,621 --> 00:34:03,553
It's four words?
Then it's not what I'm thinking.

596
00:34:03,554 --> 00:34:05,966
Can't we just attach the word, 'Jeon'
behind a three word answer?

597
00:34:05,966 --> 00:34:07,633
Hoon-min-jung-eum?

598
00:34:11,906 --> 00:34:15,435
[Kwang Gyu hasn't been any help
ever since their first 'Dari-Dari' mission.]

599
00:34:15,436 --> 00:34:17,134
Hoon-min-jung-eum?

600
00:34:18,247 --> 00:34:20,412
The very first book of poetry
written in Chinese characters?

601
00:34:20,413 --> 00:34:23,974
Wait a minute.
Can Lee Kwang Soo answer for him?

602
00:34:23,975 --> 00:34:26,726
He's got this sudden
glint in his eye right now.

603
00:34:26,727 --> 00:34:28,529
He just told me that he knows the answer.

604
00:34:28,530 --> 00:34:31,204
<i>Five points if he gets it right,
but minus three points if he's wrong.</i>

605
00:34:31,205 --> 00:34:33,558
- Come on!
- Fine, then we won't do it.

606
00:34:33,559 --> 00:34:36,416
- He really does have this look in his eye.
- No, we're not doing it.

607
00:34:36,417 --> 00:34:38,220
- No, don't do it.
- Let's let him do it.

608
00:34:38,221 --> 00:34:40,298
- Suk Jin doesn't know it anyway.
- Kwang Soo, are you sure of the answer?

609
00:34:40,299 --> 00:34:42,898
- I know the answer.
- Then send him in!

610
00:34:44,073 --> 00:34:47,427
[First time seeing him like this-
Could Kwang Soo really have the answer?]

611
00:34:47,428 --> 00:34:49,378
Then I'll go with the answer
that I'm thinking of.

612
00:34:49,379 --> 00:34:51,302
<i>Okay, let me reiterate this.</i>

613
00:34:51,303 --> 00:34:55,549
<i>Five points if he gets it right,
but minus three points if he's wrong.</i>

614
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:57,291
- Are you sure of your answer?
- Okay, I understand.

615
00:34:58,143 --> 00:35:02,646
[Can Kwang Soo come up with
the right answer?]

616
00:35:02,647 --> 00:35:06,124
[What is the first ever book of poetry
that Kwang Soo is thinking of?]

617
00:35:06,159 --> 00:35:07,750
Hakwon Byeolkok!

618
00:35:08,585 --> 00:35:10,781
[What?]

619
00:35:11,384 --> 00:35:13,974
[What about 'Hakwon Byeolkok'?]

620
00:35:13,975 --> 00:35:17,218
[Answer wrong,
then you get the windy hairdryer!]

621
00:35:17,697 --> 00:35:20,592
[He was given the benefit of the doubt,
but as always...]

622
00:35:20,593 --> 00:35:24,625
[Three points are subtracted as agreed upon,
so they're down to 11 points.]

623
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:27,285
<i>Isn't that a name of a song?</i>

624
00:35:28,098 --> 00:35:29,714
[Ah... now that they think about it...]

625
00:35:29,715 --> 00:35:33,884
[That was a 1997 debut song
by Sechs Kies.]

626
00:35:34,943 --> 00:35:36,776
He said he knew the answer.

627
00:35:36,777 --> 00:35:39,762
[Shifting the blame on each other.]

628
00:35:41,727 --> 00:35:44,899
[How could he have lost them the three points
that they worked so hard to earn?]

629
00:35:45,233 --> 00:35:47,939
Ji Suk Jin forgoes his turn, so
you may go back to your seat now.

630
00:35:48,564 --> 00:35:51,466
- Who did you think came up with that?
- Sechs Kies.

631
00:35:52,878 --> 00:35:54,397
Give it back.
Give me the three points back.

632
00:35:54,398 --> 00:35:55,831
How can I give it back?

633
00:35:56,161 --> 00:35:58,273
[What's the correct answer?]

634
00:35:58,274 --> 00:36:01,425
- The name of the poet is, Kim Si Seup.
- I know the answer!

635
00:36:01,426 --> 00:36:03,923
It's Geum-Ho-Shin-Hwa!

636
00:36:03,924 --> 00:36:06,452
[Kim Si Seup's Geum-Ho-Shin-Hwa.]

637
00:36:06,453 --> 00:36:08,988
- Ah, Geum-Ho-Shin-Hwa?
- Geum-Ho-Shin-Hwa!

638
00:36:10,419 --> 00:36:13,187
Hey, it's wasn't Sechs Kies,
but it's Shinhwa!

639
00:36:13,747 --> 00:36:16,378
[Oh my goodness...]

640
00:36:17,887 --> 00:36:20,965
[Thus starts the trials and ordeals
for these men...]

641
00:36:21,114 --> 00:36:27,390
<i>Who is the German philosopher who
advocated the idea of Nihilism?</i>

642
00:36:28,666 --> 00:36:30,426
It's the man who said that
the God was dead.

643
00:36:30,427 --> 00:36:31,802
Hegel.

644
00:36:33,076 --> 00:36:35,707
[Wrong answer]

645
00:36:35,708 --> 00:36:37,913
[Correct answer is, Nietzsche.
Jun Hyun Moo gets it wrong.]

646
00:36:37,914 --> 00:36:40,065
It's not God, who's dead, but it's you.
Come back to your seat.

647
00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:46,554
[Followed by Kwang Gyu's incorrect answer
to Women's Feelings for three points.]

648
00:36:46,555 --> 00:36:49,959
[Kwang Soo inevitably gets the wrong answer
for Fashion for four points.]

649
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:53,555
[Parade of wrong answers.]

650
00:36:53,556 --> 00:36:57,035
Even if they don't get
any more points...

651
00:36:57,999 --> 00:37:02,434
[Even if they don't get any
more points?]

652
00:37:03,147 --> 00:37:04,735
That's good!

653
00:37:04,736 --> 00:37:07,623
How many points do we have so far?

654
00:37:07,624 --> 00:37:09,993
- 11 points.
- How many of us are left?

655
00:37:09,994 --> 00:37:12,472
- It's all over already.
- Let's forget everything and start over.

656
00:37:13,447 --> 00:37:16,167
[Since it's impossible to win the first round,
they suggest starting over from scratch.]

657
00:37:16,168 --> 00:37:17,776
That was a practice round!

658
00:37:18,345 --> 00:37:21,211
[They're calling that a practice round
because they're at a disadvantage?]

659
00:37:21,212 --> 00:37:29,062
<i>Okay, then here's the new deal. If
you score more than 30 points this time...</i>

660
00:37:29,528 --> 00:37:31,975
<i>then we'll give you three
separate hints.</i>

661
00:37:31,976 --> 00:37:36,238
<i>And if you score more than 20 points,
then we'll give you two separate points.</i>

662
00:37:36,239 --> 00:37:38,336
- That sounds good.
- I like that deal.

663
00:37:38,337 --> 00:37:40,932
[A deal that everyone
seems to be happy about.]

664
00:37:40,933 --> 00:37:43,760
<i>Lastly, we'll give you one hint
if you score more than ten points.</i>

665
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:47,557
[One hint for every ten points earned.]

666
00:37:47,558 --> 00:37:49,220
Yes, let's do that.

667
00:37:51,082 --> 00:37:53,492
- Gary can go next.
- Gary, then Muzy.

668
00:37:53,493 --> 00:37:56,162
[Random Mr. Capable is up
as the first player up.]

669
00:37:57,288 --> 00:38:00,963
- Which one are you doing, Gary?
- Why don't you go with sports?

670
00:38:00,964 --> 00:38:03,212
- Sports for two points.
- Muzy can do the relationship category.

671
00:38:05,566 --> 00:38:07,122
<i>Here's your sports question.</i>

672
00:38:07,123 --> 00:38:09,542
This is making me nervous.
It's burdensome.

673
00:38:09,543 --> 00:38:12,414
<i>The keyword is... Ball games.</i>

674
00:38:12,415 --> 00:38:14,689
- Okay, ball games.
- You like this stuff.

675
00:38:15,308 --> 00:38:17,719
<i>Here's your ball game question.</i>

676
00:38:18,093 --> 00:38:24,072
<i>What is a French ball game with the name
that translates into, 'Catch it'?</i>

677
00:38:24,073 --> 00:38:26,314
- What?
- Catch it?

678
00:38:26,315 --> 00:38:29,805
- A French game?
- Think of a game where you have to catch.

679
00:38:30,455 --> 00:38:33,531
- What's 'Catch it' in French?
- What game requires you to catch?

680
00:38:34,615 --> 00:38:36,091
This is really hard.

681
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:37,927
It's a ball game of sorts?

682
00:38:39,442 --> 00:38:41,722
Is it a world famous sport?

683
00:38:41,723 --> 00:38:44,114
<i>You can't keep asking all those
sorts of questions.</i>

684
00:38:44,115 --> 00:38:46,875
<i>I'll give you one hint.</i>

685
00:38:46,876 --> 00:38:50,004
- Ask him the size of the ball.
- It's a ball game of sorts?

686
00:38:50,005 --> 00:38:51,603
Ask him for the size of the ball.

687
00:38:51,604 --> 00:38:53,863
- How big is the ball?
- It's big enough.

688
00:38:56,845 --> 00:38:59,235
- Gary.
- If you take a look at the ball...

689
00:38:59,236 --> 00:39:01,033
<i>The ball isn't all that big.</i>

690
00:39:03,701 --> 00:39:07,820
- You have five seconds. Five, four, three...
- Should I just answer it?

691
00:39:07,821 --> 00:39:10,679
- Just answer it.
- Two, one.

692
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:12,210
Tennis.

693
00:39:13,075 --> 00:39:15,873
[Gary's answer is, tennis.]

694
00:39:15,874 --> 00:39:17,710
I think he's right.

695
00:39:19,712 --> 00:39:23,610
[Gary answers correctly!]

696
00:39:25,708 --> 00:39:29,788
[How did he know that?]

697
00:39:29,789 --> 00:39:32,239
I just went with my gut feeling.
I really had no idea.

698
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:35,506
[This is why he's dubbed,
Random Mr. Capable.]

699
00:39:35,507 --> 00:39:37,772
Isn't there like
Wimbledon Tennis Tournament?

700
00:39:37,773 --> 00:39:42,138
<i>Yes, the term 'Tennis' itself
is a name of sorts.</i>

701
00:39:42,139 --> 00:39:44,608
Isn't Wimbledon in France?

702
00:39:45,248 --> 00:39:48,349
[It definitely was a random guess.]

703
00:39:48,350 --> 00:39:50,443
- That was amazing.
- That was awesome.

704
00:39:50,444 --> 00:39:53,072
Hey, how did you know that
it was tennis?

705
00:39:53,073 --> 00:39:55,095
I've always been good at guessing.

706
00:39:55,643 --> 00:39:58,938
[Two points gained right from the start.]

707
00:39:58,939 --> 00:40:01,310
You've earned yourselves two points
thanks to Kang Gary.

708
00:40:01,311 --> 00:40:04,856
This feels like he just earned five points.

709
00:40:04,857 --> 00:40:07,056
- This is no different than earning 5 points.
- You did a great job.

710
00:40:07,057 --> 00:40:09,414
- Muzy, you're up!
- These questions are hard.

711
00:40:09,415 --> 00:40:13,426
[Next player up is, Muzy.]

712
00:40:13,427 --> 00:40:15,793
I had no idea what the answer was.

713
00:40:16,946 --> 00:40:19,718
- I'll go with the relationship category.
- Relationship!

714
00:40:19,719 --> 00:40:21,281
Relationship for two points.

715
00:40:21,282 --> 00:40:22,998
<i>Relationship for two points.</i>

716
00:40:22,999 --> 00:40:25,651
<i>The keyword is, Neologisms.</i>

717
00:40:26,936 --> 00:40:29,263
- Neologisms.
- Wow, that's crazy.

718
00:40:29,669 --> 00:40:35,087
<i>Muzy, Muzy...</i>

719
00:40:35,615 --> 00:40:38,408
If you don't get this right,
then you'll be disgraced.

720
00:40:38,409 --> 00:40:40,363
- Neologisms?
- Here's your question.

721
00:40:40,364 --> 00:40:45,971
<i>What is the neologism used to coin someone
like Kwang Soo who falls in love easily?</i>

722
00:40:46,679 --> 00:40:48,183
That's way too easy.

723
00:40:48,184 --> 00:40:51,417
- That's too easy, Muzy.
- The answer is already obvious.

724
00:40:51,418 --> 00:40:53,334
<i>You can't look behind you.</i>

725
00:40:53,335 --> 00:40:55,731
- Can you say that again?
- Everyone must keep quiet.

726
00:40:55,732 --> 00:40:58,599
What is the neologism used to coin someone
like Kwang Soo who falls in love easily?

727
00:40:58,599 --> 00:41:01,314
- You have to know this.
- You have five seconds.

728
00:41:02,473 --> 00:41:04,388
Neologism...

729
00:41:04,389 --> 00:41:07,200
- Four, three, two, one!
- What could it be?

730
00:41:07,201 --> 00:41:08,595
Hopeful?

731
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:12,386
[Wrong]

732
00:41:12,877 --> 00:41:15,916
- What is it?
- Geum-Sa-Ppa! (Falls easily)

733
00:41:16,358 --> 00:41:19,678
[Geum-Sa-Ppa:
A person who falls in love easily.]

734
00:41:19,679 --> 00:41:22,284
[Muzy unfortunately fails at
earning the team any points.]

735
00:41:22,285 --> 00:41:24,748
You've only earned yourselves
two points so far.

736
00:41:24,749 --> 00:41:27,904
Jang Ki Ha!
Jang Ki Ha!

737
00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:31,004
[The return of their hero?]

738
00:41:31,005 --> 00:41:33,998
Go for a five pointer!

739
00:41:33,999 --> 00:41:35,568
Jang Ki Ha, fighting!

740
00:41:35,569 --> 00:41:37,519
Which question would you like?

741
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:40,176
- A five pointer?
- History!

742
00:41:40,177 --> 00:41:42,416
Go for the history category.

743
00:41:42,417 --> 00:41:46,176
- Go for the SAT category.
- Not economics, I don't know that.

744
00:41:46,177 --> 00:41:48,069
- I'll go with History.
- History!

745
00:41:48,070 --> 00:41:49,706
History for five points.

746
00:41:50,554 --> 00:41:52,082
History for five points.

747
00:41:52,725 --> 00:41:55,494
- This is going to be a tough one.
- I'm nervous for him.

748
00:41:55,495 --> 00:41:58,955
<i>The keyword is... order.</i>

749
00:41:58,956 --> 00:42:00,849
- This is going to be tough.
- Order?

750
00:42:00,850 --> 00:42:05,272
- You can do this one.
- An order of historical events?

751
00:42:05,273 --> 00:42:07,869
This should be my question!
Gap-oh-kyung-jang, 1894!

752
00:42:08,326 --> 00:42:10,739
- Stop saying that.
- Enough with that.

753
00:42:15,007 --> 00:42:20,483
[History? Order? What kind
of a tough question would it be?]

754
00:42:20,484 --> 00:42:22,446
<i>Jeongyujaeran.</i>

755
00:42:22,447 --> 00:42:23,888
I'm ruined.

756
00:42:24,359 --> 00:42:25,997
<i>Dynamic movement.</i>

757
00:42:26,547 --> 00:42:28,580
<i>Hunminjeongeum hangul.</i>

758
00:42:28,977 --> 00:42:30,997
<i>Completion of Suwon.</i>

759
00:42:30,998 --> 00:42:32,566
<i>Four events.</i>

760
00:42:32,567 --> 00:42:35,466
<i>Please put them in chronological order.</i>

761
00:42:35,467 --> 00:42:37,864
- First was Jeongyujaeran.
- Jeongyujaeran.

762
00:42:37,865 --> 00:42:39,683
Next was Dynamic movement.

763
00:42:40,129 --> 00:42:41,882
<i>Completion of Suwon.</i>

764
00:42:41,883 --> 00:42:44,027
- No way is he going to get this.
- I don't know.

765
00:42:44,028 --> 00:42:46,694
This is a Golden Bell level question.

766
00:42:46,695 --> 00:42:48,625
- This is really hard.
- What's the last one?

767
00:42:49,129 --> 00:42:50,948
If Ki Ha answers this right...

768
00:42:52,203 --> 00:42:54,710
- He's thinking right now.
- I think he's going to get this.

769
00:42:54,711 --> 00:42:58,430
- No shame in getting it wrong.
- No, I know Ki Ha can do this.

770
00:42:58,431 --> 00:43:00,910
- Ki Ha can do this.
- He looks so cool from the back.

771
00:43:00,911 --> 00:43:04,906
- I feel so much confidence in him.
- I know that he can do this.

772
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:09,054
Ki Ha looks really dashing when he's
trying to figure out the quiz questions.

773
00:43:09,055 --> 00:43:11,475
He almost looks sexy.

774
00:43:11,476 --> 00:43:14,283
- What if I get it wrong?
- You'd be so sexy if you get it right.

775
00:43:15,312 --> 00:43:17,505
- I'm going to take a guess.
- He's ready with the answer.

776
00:43:17,506 --> 00:43:18,985
He's about to answer.

777
00:43:18,986 --> 00:43:20,602
Hunminjeongeum hangul is first.

778
00:43:21,524 --> 00:43:22,705
Really?

779
00:43:23,777 --> 00:43:26,311
- He won't be wrong from the start, right?
- Let us know if it's wrong.

780
00:43:26,312 --> 00:43:28,096
He must be right.

781
00:43:28,097 --> 00:43:30,486
Dynamic movement is last.

782
00:43:30,487 --> 00:43:32,560
- Really?
- I wouldn't have known.

783
00:43:33,431 --> 00:43:35,181
What are the other two that are left?

784
00:43:35,182 --> 00:43:38,678
Completion of Suwon.

785
00:43:38,679 --> 00:43:42,002
- I feel like I've heard it before.
- What's 'Jeongyujaeran'?

786
00:43:43,074 --> 00:43:46,411
Jeongyujaeran is second, and
Completion of Suwon is third.

787
00:43:48,672 --> 00:43:51,262
- I think Jeongyujaeran is right.
- I think he's got it right.

788
00:43:52,209 --> 00:43:55,632
Jeongyujaeran is second, and
Completion of Suwon is third.

789
00:44:00,716 --> 00:44:07,374
[Would he have answered this five point
question correctly?]

790
00:44:08,567 --> 00:44:10,938
[Correct]

791
00:44:10,939 --> 00:44:14,450
[Jan Ki Ha gets the correct answer!]

792
00:44:20,305 --> 00:44:24,308
[Jeongyujaeran-
A war during the Joseon era.]

793
00:44:24,309 --> 00:44:27,674
[Everyone is impressed by
Ki Ha's sexy intellectual mind.]

794
00:44:30,398 --> 00:44:35,234
[Tears of envy over something that these
guys can never even hope to have...]

795
00:44:37,355 --> 00:44:39,542
Ki Ha is a genius.

796
00:44:39,543 --> 00:44:41,788
[Ki Ha's impressive intellectual skills.]

797
00:44:41,789 --> 00:44:44,547
[Five additional points!
A total of seven points earned.]

Jang Ki Ha!
Jang Ki Ha!

799
00:44:48,436 --> 00:44:52,198
Don't do anything else on Running Man today.
Just keep doing the quiz, Ki Ha.

800
00:44:52,199 --> 00:44:54,075
[Answering these quiz questions
is more than plenty for them.]

801
00:44:54,076 --> 00:44:56,901
[Has been dubbed
'The Quiz King of Running Man.']

802
00:44:56,902 --> 00:44:58,970
Can we just keep playing this quiz game
for the next four weeks of our show?

803
00:44:58,971 --> 00:45:00,630
- This is fun.
- This is way too fun.

804
00:45:00,631 --> 00:45:03,503
- I feel like I'm getting so much smarter.
- I really like this game.

805
00:45:03,504 --> 00:45:06,068
Can we make this one of our staple games?

806
00:45:06,069 --> 00:45:08,131
This game is a lot of fun.

807
00:45:08,132 --> 00:45:10,738
This game makes me even more nervous
than the name tag elimination game.

808
00:45:10,739 --> 00:45:13,292
This game really is nerve-wrecking.

809
00:45:13,293 --> 00:45:15,570
- And I feel like I'm learning something.
- Me too.

810
00:45:15,969 --> 00:45:19,471
[Also gaining a sense of camaraderie
from having to work together.]

811
00:45:20,499 --> 00:45:22,767
I'm sorry, but my schedule is too busy.

812
00:45:23,598 --> 00:45:27,521
[Sorry, but no need to invite me
to any more of these quiz games...]

813
00:45:30,148 --> 00:45:31,718
Chung-rok-pa!

814
00:45:32,562 --> 00:45:38,070
[Lee Juck- 4 points, Jun Hyun Moo- 5 points,
and now, Yoo Jae Suk- 4 points.]

815
00:45:38,071 --> 00:45:41,882
[A total of 20 points earned so far.]

816
00:45:41,883 --> 00:45:43,712
- Let's go for 30 points.
- We already have 20 points, right?

817
00:45:43,713 --> 00:45:46,565
- We have 20 points.
- You're doing great. You have 20 points.

818
00:45:46,566 --> 00:45:48,421
We've already got two hints.

819
00:45:48,422 --> 00:45:50,874
- Then let's play the rest with ease.
- No need to be nervous.

820
00:45:50,875 --> 00:45:53,611
- No, we need to get all three hints.
- Take history for four points.

821
00:45:53,612 --> 00:45:55,705
- That's the last of the four point question.
- Ha Ha won't be able to get it.

822
00:45:55,706 --> 00:45:59,090
We need a five point question.
Can you give us two more five pointers?

823
00:45:59,701 --> 00:46:02,787
<i>Okay, this is what I'll do then.
I'll answer your proposal with one of my own.</i>

824
00:46:02,788 --> 00:46:05,111
<i>We'll go with two five point questions.</i>

825
00:46:06,173 --> 00:46:09,209
<i>But if you get it wrong,
you'll be docked one point.</i>

826
00:46:09,843 --> 00:46:13,114
- Ha Ha's not very credible.
- I don't know if he'll get it.

827
00:46:13,115 --> 00:46:15,339
[Must risk the danger for it to be possible
for them to get the 30 points.]

828
00:46:15,340 --> 00:46:17,085
<i>You can choose whichever category you'd like.</i>

829
00:46:17,086 --> 00:46:18,829
- You can do this.
- Nonsense for five points?

830
00:46:18,830 --> 00:46:21,873
- Go for Nonsense for five points.
- Yeah, you can do that.

831
00:46:21,874 --> 00:46:24,354
- Nonsense for five points.
- There you go!

832
00:46:25,510 --> 00:46:28,387
[This is the toughest question Ha Ha
has ever taken on in a quiz game.]

833
00:46:30,127 --> 00:46:33,757
- I'm really nervous right now.
- This is like an SAT level question.

834
00:46:33,758 --> 00:46:36,047
This feels like
the final Golden Bell question.

835
00:46:37,199 --> 00:46:40,339
<i>You'll be docked one point if your get it
wrong like agreed upon.</i>

836
00:46:41,673 --> 00:46:43,578
<i>Nonsense for five points.</i>

837
00:46:47,123 --> 00:46:48,662
<i>Here's your question.</i>

838
00:46:49,974 --> 00:46:54,014
<i>What is the world's simplest number?</i>

839
00:46:54,015 --> 00:46:58,016
<i>What is the world's simplest number?</i>

840
00:47:01,865 --> 00:47:05,096
[It seems as though
they're reminded of something...]

841
00:47:07,850 --> 00:47:09,161
You can't look behind you.

842
00:47:09,162 --> 00:47:13,029
- Ten, nine, eight...
- This is really easy!

843
00:47:13,030 --> 00:47:15,230
Number, a number...

844
00:47:15,681 --> 00:47:21,165
- Six, five, four, three...
- Think about it.

845
00:47:22,151 --> 00:47:24,923
<i>Two, one...</i>

846
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:26,886
One!

847
00:47:27,396 --> 00:47:29,870
[Wrong]

848
00:47:31,090 --> 00:47:32,670
[What is the world's simplest number?]

849
00:47:32,671 --> 00:47:34,803
- It's either 19, or 50, isn't it?
- Or is it 20?

850
00:47:34,804 --> 00:47:38,241
- It's 19!
- The correct answer is...

851
00:47:38,242 --> 00:47:40,739
<i>190,000.
(Sound of the number means, 'Very easy'.]</i>

852
00:47:40,740 --> 00:47:42,987
[Correct answer- 19,000.]

853
00:47:44,517 --> 00:47:46,708
[Ah...]

854
00:47:47,860 --> 00:47:50,125
- What did you say your answer was?
- Did you say, one?

855
00:47:50,126 --> 00:47:52,036
I was so flustered, so I said, one.

856
00:47:53,278 --> 00:47:56,866
That nonsense question was really hard.

857
00:47:56,867 --> 00:47:59,517
- That was really hard.
- I'm so mad at myself right now.

858
00:47:59,518 --> 00:48:02,180
The rest of this game all depends on you.

859
00:48:02,181 --> 00:48:06,884
You currently have 19 points.
Depends on whether you lose the point or not.

860
00:48:06,885 --> 00:48:09,748
[Answer it right to earn two hints,
or lose a point to earn only one hint.]

861
00:48:09,749 --> 00:48:11,335
- Should I go with the SAT question?
- No way!

862
00:48:12,831 --> 00:48:15,545
- Stop joking around.
- Relationship for one point.

863
00:48:15,546 --> 00:48:18,099
Just go with people category instead.

864
00:48:18,100 --> 00:48:20,009
- People?
- Okay, people for two points.

865
00:48:21,095 --> 00:48:23,612
- People is a good category to choose.
- I don't even notice the time passing.

866
00:48:23,613 --> 00:48:25,935
- Seriously.
- Let's do a bit of this every week.

867
00:48:25,936 --> 00:48:29,119
[Requests to bring this game back
since it's so fun.]

868
00:48:31,207 --> 00:48:35,225
This question will determine whether
we'll get two hints, or only one hint.

869
00:48:35,226 --> 00:48:37,805
[A very important question that will
determine how many hints they'll get.]

870
00:48:37,806 --> 00:48:40,583
[People for two points.]

871
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:42,783
- People for two points.
- Yes, please.

872
00:48:42,784 --> 00:48:45,818
<i>The keyword is... The beginning.</i>

873
00:48:45,853 --> 00:48:47,690
- The beginning?
- The beginning.

874
00:48:47,691 --> 00:48:49,550
This should be easy.

875
00:48:49,892 --> 00:48:56,032
<i>What is the name of the astronaut who was
the first man ever to step on the moon</i>

876
00:48:56,033 --> 00:48:59,649
<i>in year 1969 by flying into space
on a spaceship named, Apollo 11?</i>

877
00:49:00,181 --> 00:49:02,599
- Don't let yourself get confused.
- Let's get this!

878
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:05,628
The first man to step foot on the moon?

879
00:49:05,629 --> 00:49:07,576
- Yes.
- It's not the rabbit, okay?

880
00:49:07,577 --> 00:49:10,205
It's not someone from our country!

881
00:49:10,865 --> 00:49:14,053
[A riot is about to break loose
behind the old man's back.]

882
00:49:14,826 --> 00:49:17,906
- The first man to land on the moon, right?
- That's correct.

883
00:49:17,907 --> 00:49:19,701
You were already born at the time.

884
00:49:19,702 --> 00:49:21,433
- I was already born by then, right?
- You saw the event, didn't you?

885
00:49:23,054 --> 00:49:26,270
- Do you need the full name?
- He knows. that means that he knows.

886
00:49:26,271 --> 00:49:28,002
I think he knows.

887
00:49:29,672 --> 00:49:34,874
[It seems as though everyone else knows.
The correct answer is, Neil Armstrong.]

888
00:49:34,875 --> 00:49:39,655
[Will he get the correct answer?]

889
00:49:39,656 --> 00:49:41,776
Will Armstrong.

890
00:49:42,211 --> 00:49:44,574
[Will?]

891
00:49:44,575 --> 00:49:46,466
[Wrong]

892
00:49:46,467 --> 00:49:48,913
Will Armstrong.

893
00:49:48,914 --> 00:49:51,861
[Who's 'Will Armstrong'?]

894
00:49:51,862 --> 00:49:55,119
[Kim Kwang Gyu answers incorrectly.]

895
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:57,274
How could you say, Will?

896
00:49:57,275 --> 00:49:59,410
- It's 'Neil'!
- Don't you even know?

897
00:49:59,411 --> 00:50:02,570
- It's 'Neil'?
- Are you kidding me right now?

898
00:50:02,571 --> 00:50:04,250
[To miss such an easy question...]

899
00:50:07,317 --> 00:50:10,455
We were telling you not to get
Neil confused with Louis Armstrong.

900
00:50:10,456 --> 00:50:13,297
- We told you not to get confused.
- If anything, you guys confused me more!

901
00:50:13,298 --> 00:50:14,561
You guys confused me.

902
00:50:14,793 --> 00:50:18,489
You only gained yourselves a single hint
for having answered, Will Armstrong.

903
00:50:18,490 --> 00:50:20,694
[Gained one hint from having
earned 18 points.]

904
00:50:20,695 --> 00:50:24,090
[No more attempts are allowed.]

905
00:50:24,091 --> 00:50:25,884
<i>Thus, you guys have
earned yourselves one hint total.</i>

906
00:50:26,486 --> 00:50:28,417
This was really fun.
Let's do this every week.

907
00:50:28,418 --> 00:50:30,202
I feel like I'm getting smarter.

908
00:50:30,203 --> 00:50:33,195
Mr. Will Armstrong can choose the hint.

909
00:50:33,196 --> 00:50:35,318
Okay, I'll pick.

910
00:50:35,319 --> 00:50:38,118
This is really disappointing, MC Blank.

911
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:43,441
[Rap hint?]

912
00:50:44,604 --> 00:50:47,672
<i>We will sing you the rank standing
in chronological order.</i>

913
00:50:47,673 --> 00:50:50,099
- You're going to rap it?
- It's going to be rapped.

914
00:50:50,100 --> 00:50:52,441
- I bet I know what they're going to do.
- It's going to be twice the speed.

915
00:50:52,442 --> 00:50:54,625
- Twice the speed?
- Listen very carefully.

916
00:50:54,626 --> 00:50:56,456
You'll only be given one chance,
so you must listen very carefully.

917
00:50:56,457 --> 00:50:58,128
- How many times will you play it for us?
- Just once.

918
00:50:58,129 --> 00:51:00,553
- Just once.
- Where is the speaker?

919
00:51:12,564 --> 00:51:14,891
This is what we spent the past two hours
working ourselves up for?

920
00:51:17,564 --> 00:51:20,658
[Enraged at the hint that
they couldn't even understand.]

921
00:51:22,798 --> 00:51:25,293
[Giving them one more chance to listen from
the level of their unhappiness.]

922
00:51:25,294 --> 00:51:27,269
I couldn't even hear anything.

923
00:51:27,270 --> 00:51:30,098
Let's try and see if we can at least
figure out the first and the last.

924
00:51:30,099 --> 00:51:32,052
[Listen carefully]

925
00:51:37,973 --> 00:51:40,642
[Listening again wasn't much help...]

926
00:51:40,643 --> 00:51:42,835
- Yoo Jae Suk.
- Yoo Jae Suk was first.

927
00:51:43,195 --> 00:51:45,991
[Did they hear something?]

928
00:51:45,992 --> 00:51:47,337
No, it was Lee Juck.

929
00:51:47,848 --> 00:51:51,325
[First place is Yoo Jae Suk, or Lee Juck?]

930
00:51:51,326 --> 00:51:53,006
From what I heard,
first place is Lee Hwi Jae.

931
00:51:53,721 --> 00:51:56,364
[Is he hearing things now?]

932
00:51:56,365 --> 00:51:58,751
- What are you saying?
- And eighth place was Jung Won Gwan.

933
00:51:58,752 --> 00:52:01,982
[Jung Won Gwan in eighth place?]

934
00:52:03,468 --> 00:52:05,899
Okay, we're going to move on
to the next location.

935
00:52:05,900 --> 00:52:07,382
[Time to move on to the next location!]

936
00:52:07,383 --> 00:52:10,249
[Splitting into two cars befitting
of their ranking status?]

937
00:52:10,250 --> 00:52:11,347
- Thank you.
- Goodbye.

938
00:52:11,348 --> 00:52:15,464
People who thinks they're in the upper ranks
can get in the 'Upper rank' car.

939
00:52:17,064 --> 00:52:19,300
- Let Ki Ha ride in the upper rank car.
- Come, Ki Ha.

940
00:52:19,301 --> 00:52:21,422
[Ki Ha gets to ride in the upper rank car
for being the hero of the day?]

941
00:52:21,423 --> 00:52:22,919
Get in the car.

942
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:26,225
Kwang Gyu doesn't even have to think.
He can go on to the lower rank car.

943
00:52:26,226 --> 00:52:28,878
- Where is Jong Kook going to go?
- How could you have said, Will Armstrong?

944
00:52:28,879 --> 00:52:31,956
[Sad Mr. Will Armstrong.]

945
00:52:33,492 --> 00:52:36,787
[Kwang Soo is being shoved towards
the lower rank car without hesitation.]

946
00:52:39,412 --> 00:52:41,833
- You didn't have to shove me.
- Okay, but just keep walking.

947
00:52:41,834 --> 00:52:43,427
Okay, let's go.

948
00:52:43,428 --> 00:52:46,858
You know that last rapping hint?
I didn't really get to hear the words.

949
00:52:46,859 --> 00:52:50,216
First place is either Jae Suk or Lee Juck.

950
00:52:50,217 --> 00:52:52,664
[The rap hints alludes that first place
is either Jae Suk or Lee Juck?]

951
00:52:53,335 --> 00:52:57,240
- It's either Jae Suk or Lee Juck.
- I really didn't hear anything.

952
00:52:57,241 --> 00:53:00,243
- It was at twice the speed.
- I think I heard Kwang Soo in third place.

953
00:53:00,244 --> 00:53:01,693
Lee Kwang Soo in third place?

954
00:53:02,822 --> 00:53:08,488
Since Lee Juck is known for his heartfelt
songs such as 'It's a relief'...

955
00:53:08,489 --> 00:53:10,471
- You're so right.
- Because he sings all romantic songs...

956
00:53:10,471 --> 00:53:13,546
The type of man whom the women think would
sing those types of songs for them?

957
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:16,517
Since the question is about which man
the women would like to date?

958
00:53:16,518 --> 00:53:18,452
I can't believe you just talked about
yourself like that.

959
00:53:19,143 --> 00:53:23,162
Come on, think about this.
Jong Kook wasn't one of the kids' drawings.

960
00:53:23,163 --> 00:53:26,029
And the other hint said that I'm one rank
higher up than Jong Kook.

961
00:53:26,030 --> 00:53:28,144
And third and sixth place holders
are already known.

962
00:53:28,145 --> 00:53:31,558
Meaning, 1st and 2nd place, or
4th and 5th place are the only possibilities.

963
00:53:31,559 --> 00:53:32,938
That sounds about right.

964
00:53:32,939 --> 00:53:35,869
1st and 2nd place or 4th and 5th place
are the only possible answers for us.

965
00:53:35,870 --> 00:53:37,678
You're right.
That sounds right.

966
00:53:38,343 --> 00:53:41,459
I think everyone does need some
brain power.

967
00:53:43,798 --> 00:53:47,815
[A brainy character that has never been
one of the mainstays on Running Man.]

968
00:53:49,457 --> 00:53:52,110
We need to make sure to win
this final hint.

969
00:53:52,111 --> 00:53:54,584
First place is Jae Suk, second is Gary,
then Kwang Soo in third place...

970
00:53:54,585 --> 00:53:57,146
Fourth place is Lee Juck,
and Jong Kook is in fifth place.

971
00:53:57,147 --> 00:54:00,037
- Jong Kook in fifth.
- Sixth place is... Ki Ha.

972
00:54:00,038 --> 00:54:02,580
Then seventh, eighth, and ninth would be
me, Hyun Moo...

973
00:54:02,581 --> 00:54:05,831
- The drawing with big eyes is Hyun Moo.
- And he also used to have red hair.

974
00:54:05,832 --> 00:54:08,765
So seventh, eighth, and ninth would be
Hyun Moo, myself, and... who else is there?

975
00:54:09,381 --> 00:54:12,163
[Possible candidates for 7th, 8th, and 9th-
Hyun Moo, Suk Jin and Ha Ha?]

976
00:54:12,164 --> 00:54:14,940
[A shocking turnabout in the ranking position
will soon be revealed.]

977
00:54:15,793 --> 00:54:19,495
[Seoul 'E' Women's university.]

978
00:54:19,496 --> 00:54:24,343
<i>We have arrived at a women's college where
we'll get to find out how popular you are.</i>

979
00:54:24,344 --> 00:54:26,653
[The next mission on campus...]

980
00:54:34,326 --> 00:54:37,783
Even though Gary may be very unattractive,
there's something very enigmatic about him.

981
00:54:37,784 --> 00:54:40,938
- The way he treats Song Ji Hyo is adorable.
- I love you, Gary.

982
00:54:40,939 --> 00:54:43,400
- Jong Kook is so handsome.
- I love you, Ha Ha.

983
00:54:43,401 --> 00:54:44,986
Jang Ki Ha is the best.

984
00:54:45,490 --> 00:54:47,608
[Wow... Gary?]

985
00:54:50,207 --> 00:54:53,770
<i>Here's your final mission.</i>

986
00:54:53,771 --> 00:54:57,141
- This is our last mission.
- We're finished if we don't get this.

987
00:54:57,142 --> 00:54:59,161
Yoo Jae Suk,
you may get out of the car.

988
00:54:59,848 --> 00:55:02,227
- What is the next mission?
- Scoot over a bit.

989
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:08,328
[Mission aside, Big-nosed Brother is just glad
to have a bigger space to sit in.]

990
00:55:08,907 --> 00:55:10,852
You need to go find the 'R' marked flag.

991
00:55:10,853 --> 00:55:12,793
'R' marked flag?

992
00:55:12,794 --> 00:55:15,215
I've got a soft spot for this place.

993
00:55:15,216 --> 00:55:16,556
[Second runner- Lee Juck.]

994
00:55:16,823 --> 00:55:18,933
<i>Do you have bad memories of
women's universities or something?</i>

995
00:55:18,934 --> 00:55:21,893
I used to be the designated on-campus
singer for this university back in the day.

996
00:55:22,210 --> 00:55:24,897
But that all changed once Sung Si Kyung
came onto the scene.

997
00:55:24,898 --> 00:55:26,941
You need to go find the 'R2' marked flag.

998
00:55:38,390 --> 00:55:40,472
Wow, there are so many people here.
Hello, everyone.

999
00:55:40,473 --> 00:55:42,484
Hello.

1000
00:55:42,849 --> 00:55:45,395
I need to go find the 'R1' marked flag.

1001
00:55:45,396 --> 00:55:46,927
'R2' marked flag.

1002
00:55:46,928 --> 00:55:48,507
Hello.

1003
00:55:48,508 --> 00:55:51,310
- You know who I am?
- I know your new song, 'Lies'!

1004
00:55:51,311 --> 00:55:53,017
Lies, lies, lies!

1005
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:56,096
[Fervent popularity from
countless number of female students.]

1006
00:55:56,097 --> 00:55:57,681
Yes, thank you.

1007
00:55:57,682 --> 00:55:59,230
Yes, thank you so much.

1008
00:56:00,270 --> 00:56:01,911
I can't believe this.

1009
00:56:02,490 --> 00:56:04,398
Smart Jang Ki Ha.

1010
00:56:04,399 --> 00:56:08,357
- Go out, and you'll see an 'R1' marked flag.
- An 'R1' marked flag?

1011
00:56:08,358 --> 00:56:10,158
Yes, you need to go find the flag.

1012
00:56:10,159 --> 00:56:12,897
[Brainy Ki Ha gets on his way!]

1013
00:56:13,428 --> 00:56:16,881
Go out the door and find your way
over to 'R2' flag.

1014
00:56:16,882 --> 00:56:18,068
- 'R2'?
- Yes.

1015
00:56:24,639 --> 00:56:26,075
What is this?

1016
00:56:26,076 --> 00:56:27,612
<i>[Find and bring back one female student
within five minutes.]</i>

1017
00:56:27,613 --> 00:56:31,508
<i>[Win 5 hints by each of the men bringing back
a student with all different surnames.]</i>

1018
00:56:31,509 --> 00:56:33,232
- Each of you will bring back a student.
- Okay.

1019
00:56:33,233 --> 00:56:36,868
And if you all bring back someone with
different surnames, then you'll get a hint.

1020
00:56:37,602 --> 00:56:39,124
That's just absurd.

1021
00:56:40,081 --> 00:56:45,465
So all 11 of us needs to bring back a student
with all different surnames to succeed?

1022
00:56:45,466 --> 00:56:47,706
So it's all about chance when we're
all gathered together?

1023
00:56:51,014 --> 00:56:53,040
- Anyone with a unique surname?
- What's your surname?

1024
00:56:53,041 --> 00:56:55,979
[All 11 of them must find students
with different surnames.]

1025
00:56:56,550 --> 00:56:57,832
Excuse me.

1026
00:56:57,833 --> 00:56:59,420
I just need one student.

1027
00:56:59,421 --> 00:57:01,659
I need help from one of you.

1028
00:57:01,660 --> 00:57:03,119
What's your surname?

1029
00:57:03,615 --> 00:57:06,127
- It's 'Han'!
- 'Han'?

1030
00:57:06,128 --> 00:57:07,789
'Han'?

1031
00:57:07,790 --> 00:57:11,089
'Kim'?
We need some unique last names.

1032
00:57:11,090 --> 00:57:13,641
- What's your last name?
- It's 'Kim'.

1033
00:57:13,642 --> 00:57:18,780
We need to gather a total of 11 students
from this campus.

1034
00:57:19,214 --> 00:57:21,172
And all 11 of these students
must have different last names.

1035
00:57:21,173 --> 00:57:22,733
- What's your last name?
- Excuse me?

1036
00:57:22,734 --> 00:57:24,921
- What's your last name?
- It's 'Lee'.

1037
00:57:24,922 --> 00:57:26,507
- What's your last name?
- 'Park'.

1038
00:57:26,948 --> 00:57:29,592
['Kim', 'Lee', 'Park'...
Most are very common surnames...]

1039
00:57:29,593 --> 00:57:32,356
[He's about to ask the surnames of
every single student on campus.]

1040
00:57:33,513 --> 00:57:37,042
[An endless stream of 'Kim', 'Lee', 'Park'.]

1041
00:57:39,293 --> 00:57:43,129
[No one has a clue as to which last name
each other will bring back to the group.]

1042
00:57:43,130 --> 00:57:44,288
I just need one person.

1043
00:57:45,102 --> 00:57:46,302
- What's your last name?
- It's 'Na'.

1044
00:57:46,303 --> 00:57:47,448
'Na'?

1045
00:57:47,449 --> 00:57:49,705
[Oh... not a very common surname!]

1046
00:57:50,324 --> 00:57:52,931
[Rule- Must be a student of this university.]

1047
00:57:53,953 --> 00:57:56,593
[Ah... she's a student
from another university.]

1048
00:57:56,780 --> 00:57:59,080
[Rule-
Must be a current student of this school.]

1049
00:57:59,837 --> 00:58:02,461
Are there any foreign students here
who have been naturalized?

1050
00:58:03,732 --> 00:58:05,749
[What?]

1051
00:58:08,051 --> 00:58:10,625
Excuse me, are you a student
of this school?

1052
00:58:11,119 --> 00:58:13,165
- What's your last name?
- It's 'Park'.

1053
00:58:13,166 --> 00:58:15,352
'Park' isn't going to work.
What's your last name?

1054
00:58:19,092 --> 00:58:21,179
- Do you have a student ID?
- Yes.

1055
00:58:21,180 --> 00:58:23,061
Can you show it to me?

1056
00:58:24,510 --> 00:58:27,366
- Can you make an appearance on Running Man?
- Excuse me?

1057
00:58:27,367 --> 00:58:29,055
- Appearance on Running Man?
- Do it!

1058
00:58:29,056 --> 00:58:30,644
You can come with me right now.

1059
00:58:30,645 --> 00:58:32,355
We don't have much time.

1060
00:58:32,356 --> 00:58:33,813
Okay, lets run.

1061
00:58:35,141 --> 00:58:38,203
There it is.
I think we're going to be good.

1062
00:58:41,453 --> 00:58:43,818
What?
'Hyun'?

1063
00:58:44,435 --> 00:58:47,404
That's good. That's a good one.
Do you have a student ID?

1064
00:58:47,405 --> 00:58:48,753
Let me see it.

1065
00:58:49,858 --> 00:58:51,603
That's great!
Let's go.

1066
00:58:51,604 --> 00:58:54,775
- We're good.
- No 'Kim', 'Lee', 'Park' for now.

1067
00:58:54,776 --> 00:58:57,457
I think everyone else
is thinking the same thing.

1068
00:58:57,458 --> 00:59:00,007
[But... what if no one brings back
any of those common surnames?]

1069
00:59:00,008 --> 00:59:01,604
Welcome.

1070
00:59:02,672 --> 00:59:05,107
[Jae Suk arrives at the meeting destination.]

1071
00:59:05,108 --> 00:59:07,032
- You left after me?
- Hello.

1072
00:59:07,033 --> 00:59:10,514
- You found a unique surname, right?
- Of course, I did.

1073
00:59:10,922 --> 00:59:13,832
[Will there really be no doubles of
any of the eleven surnames?]

1074
00:59:13,833 --> 00:59:15,007
[Worried that they may be disrupting
their busy schedule.]

1075
00:59:15,042 --> 00:59:17,073
- Where were you heading to?
- Me?

1076
00:59:17,719 --> 00:59:20,471
- I was meeting people for drinks.
- A drinking date.

1077
00:59:20,472 --> 00:59:23,080
- You'll have lots to talk about later then.
- You start drinking on Tuesdays?

1078
00:59:23,081 --> 00:59:25,955
I was going out drinking because
I failed my interview.

1079
00:59:26,567 --> 00:59:29,305
[Ah...]

1080
00:59:29,847 --> 00:59:32,820
I'm sorry.
I had no idea when I asked you that.

1081
00:59:33,915 --> 00:59:35,694
You were going out for drinks
because you were feeling down?

1082
00:59:36,540 --> 00:59:39,386
- But you applied at other places too, right?
- Yes.

1083
00:59:39,387 --> 00:59:41,911
[Principles of happiness-
Good things will soon come your way!]

1084
00:59:41,912 --> 00:59:44,488
I thought that you were going to
cause some sort of a stampede.

1085
00:59:44,721 --> 00:59:49,605
- Everyone was just so welcoming.
- I didn't cause any sort of a stampede.

1086
00:59:49,606 --> 00:59:52,403
- I walked around in ease and comfort.
- Really?

1087
00:59:53,271 --> 00:59:55,838
Maybe we were walking around
different school campuses.

1088
00:59:55,839 --> 00:59:58,388
- I was greeted with such fervent welcome.
- Really?

1089
00:59:58,389 --> 01:00:01,576
I was greeted with some welcome,
and everyone parted their way for me.

1090
01:00:01,577 --> 01:00:03,073
As if they wanted me to pass by quickly.

1091
01:00:03,074 --> 01:00:06,753
All the surnames have to be different.
I have a feeling you two will be different.

1092
01:00:06,754 --> 01:00:08,310
[Will all their surnames be different?]

1093
01:00:08,311 --> 01:00:10,376
I'm sure they'll be different.

1094
01:00:11,308 --> 01:00:16,871
Everyone is either 'Kim' or 'Lee'.
I didn't know there were so many of them.

1095
01:00:17,847 --> 01:00:20,604
[What is the surname of this student
that Ki Ha chose?]

1096
01:00:20,605 --> 01:00:22,547
I don't have a single friend who has
the same last name as I do.

1097
01:00:22,548 --> 01:00:25,358
I wonder if there won't be any
'Lee' or 'Kim' from other members.

1098
01:00:25,359 --> 01:00:27,905
[Worrying that others wouldn't have brought
anyone with the common last name.]

1099
01:00:27,906 --> 01:00:31,134
I wonder if anything else,
no one would've brought a common last name.

1100
01:00:31,684 --> 01:00:34,577
We should've done a better job of figuring out
what the other may have brought.

1101
01:00:34,578 --> 01:00:37,841
We should've found a way to communicate
with each other through telepathy.

1102
01:00:37,842 --> 01:00:41,529
[It seems as though they all brought girls
with a very unique last name.]

1103
01:00:41,530 --> 01:00:46,159
[Will they be able to succeed without
a single doubling of the same surname?]

1104
01:00:46,194 --> 01:00:47,769
You'd have to assume that the people who went
out first would've brought an easier name.

1105
01:00:48,658 --> 01:00:50,942
[Sixth member, Ki Ha also arrives.]

1106
01:00:51,757 --> 01:00:53,303
- Have a seat over here.
- Have a seat.

1107
01:00:53,668 --> 01:00:57,314
- What's your major?
- I'm in Video Media Relations.

1108
01:00:58,030 --> 01:01:00,890
Everyone has a different major.
That's so unique too.

1109
01:01:02,330 --> 01:01:05,162
[Now that there are six gathered here,
time to find out which surnames they've found]

1110
01:01:05,163 --> 01:01:06,234
- Can we ask them their surnames?
- Yes.

1111
01:01:06,235 --> 01:01:09,095
- Tell us what your name is.
- My name is...

1112
01:01:12,203 --> 01:01:14,490
My name is, Joo Jin Young.

1113
01:01:14,491 --> 01:01:16,574
- Your last name is Joo?
- Okay!

1114
01:01:16,928 --> 01:01:19,718
[All the members brightens up at
the revelation of the first surname.]

1115
01:01:19,719 --> 01:01:23,617
Even though she was heading out to have
drinks from having failed an interview...

1116
01:01:23,618 --> 01:01:26,607
She's still keeping high hopes
for tomorrow.

1117
01:01:27,267 --> 01:01:29,573
She failed her first interview today.

1118
01:01:30,179 --> 01:01:34,440
[That's already a part of the past.
But she still has high hopes for tomorrow!]

1119
01:01:34,768 --> 01:01:36,532
She says she has another interview
tomorrow.

1120
01:01:38,130 --> 01:01:40,590
[What could her surname be?]

1121
01:01:43,833 --> 01:01:46,314
My name is, Yoon Seul Bi.

1122
01:01:47,867 --> 01:01:50,637
Miss Yoon Seul Bi.
Okay, tell us what your name is.

1123
01:01:50,638 --> 01:01:52,137
My name is...

1124
01:01:52,138 --> 01:01:53,538
[Next student.]

1125
01:01:55,900 --> 01:01:58,032
My name is, Hyun Yoo Rim.

1126
01:01:59,996 --> 01:02:02,311
[Everyone's in a great mood!]

1127
01:02:03,758 --> 01:02:05,225
Okay, good.
Hyun Yoo Rim.

1128
01:02:06,455 --> 01:02:10,104
- Your neighbor in Namyangjoo.
- She lives in the next building.

1129
01:02:10,105 --> 01:02:13,660
- Then you guys are neighbors?
- Did you know Kwang Soo was your neighbor?

1130
01:02:13,661 --> 01:02:16,822
- Yes.
- What kind of a reputation does he have?

1131
01:02:17,721 --> 01:02:20,651
- Just that he's on Running Man.
- That's it?

1132
01:02:24,405 --> 01:02:27,461
When Kwang Soo grabbed her shoulder,
she flinched like she was about to get hit.

1133
01:02:27,462 --> 01:02:29,173
[Flinching from being afraid that
she was about to get hit?]

1134
01:02:29,729 --> 01:02:31,715
Just that he's on Running Man.

1135
01:02:33,287 --> 01:02:35,300
[Giraffe's threatening front paws?]

1136
01:02:35,301 --> 01:02:36,855
What kind of a reputation do you have
in your neighborhood?

1137
01:02:36,856 --> 01:02:39,557
They wanted to know what kind of a reputation
I have in our neighborhood.

1138
01:02:39,558 --> 01:02:41,604
You must have a bad reputation
amongst your neighbors.

1139
01:02:41,982 --> 01:02:44,502
- What's your last name?
- My name is...

1140
01:02:44,503 --> 01:02:46,326
[What is the name of Giraffe's neighbor?]

1141
01:02:49,332 --> 01:02:51,281
- Ra Ha Jung.
- Ra Ha Jung!

1142
01:02:52,185 --> 01:02:53,664
Ra Ha Jung!

1143
01:02:53,665 --> 01:02:56,445
Her last name is, 'Ra'.
'Ra' as in 'Ramyun'!

1144
01:03:01,185 --> 01:03:04,020
- That's a good last name. 'Ra' is good.
- Unreal, right?

1145
01:03:04,968 --> 01:03:06,555
- And she also lives in your neighborhood.
- Yes.

1146
01:03:06,556 --> 01:03:09,400
My student came from Suji.

1147
01:03:09,401 --> 01:03:12,671
- Tell us your last name.
- Suji, where Ehwa Woman's University is?

1148
01:03:12,672 --> 01:03:14,330
Her last name is very unique.

1149
01:03:18,147 --> 01:03:20,508
My name is, Sung Yoo Mi.

1150
01:03:20,509 --> 01:03:22,807
- Sung Yoo Mi.
- Ah! Sung Yoo Mi!

1151
01:03:23,228 --> 01:03:26,488
[All five of them so far have
different surnames!]

1152
01:03:26,489 --> 01:03:28,579
[Still in a good mood...]

1153
01:03:28,580 --> 01:03:29,649
- No one has the same surnames.
- Yes, you're right.

1154
01:03:29,650 --> 01:03:32,503
<i>Okay, Jun Hyun Moo,
please step out of the car.</i>

1155
01:03:32,936 --> 01:03:36,218
Go out this door and find your way
to 'R1' flag.

1156
01:03:36,219 --> 01:03:37,693
- 'R1' flag?
- Yes.

1157
01:03:41,289 --> 01:03:42,731
Thank you.

1158
01:03:49,964 --> 01:03:52,257
'R' what?
Was it 'R1'?

1159
01:03:52,258 --> 01:03:53,391
[Kkuk also gets started on his mission.]

1160
01:03:57,555 --> 01:04:00,382
[Finally getting to find out what
his new mission is.]

1161
01:04:00,383 --> 01:04:02,995
<i>[Find and bring back a student
within the next five minutes.]</i>

1162
01:04:02,996 --> 01:04:04,633
<i>[All 11 members must bring back a student
with different surname in order to succeed.]</i>

1163
01:04:04,634 --> 01:04:06,935
- You've got five minutes to do your mission.
- Five minutes?

1164
01:04:09,913 --> 01:04:12,681
Anyone with the last name, 'Nam'?
Seriously?

1165
01:04:12,682 --> 01:04:14,149
Is it really 'Nam'?

1166
01:04:14,150 --> 01:04:16,699
This is seriously...
any unique surnames?

1167
01:04:17,418 --> 01:04:19,464
Anyone with the surname, 'Sun' or 'Woo'?

1168
01:04:20,478 --> 01:04:22,658
How about, 'Jo'?
There has to be one of you here.

1169
01:04:23,613 --> 01:04:25,839
- How about, 'Gil'?
- 'Gil'?

1170
01:04:26,645 --> 01:04:28,396
'Kang'?
I'm 'Kang' too.

1171
01:04:29,345 --> 01:04:31,712
- Your nationality is?
- I'm American.

1172
01:04:31,713 --> 01:04:33,205
American?
Sorry.

1173
01:04:33,206 --> 01:04:34,981
- I'm Korean.
- What? Korean?

1174
01:04:34,982 --> 01:04:36,693
But you're not a girl.

1175
01:04:36,694 --> 01:04:39,559
- You're not a girl, right?
- I'm Korean.

1176
01:04:39,560 --> 01:04:41,751
- You're Korean? What's your name?
- Jung Ahn Na.

1177
01:04:41,752 --> 01:04:43,877
- 'Jung' is too common.
- Me!

1178
01:04:43,878 --> 01:04:47,201
Ki Ha's really been stepping up
to the plate today.

1179
01:04:47,202 --> 01:04:49,146
- Congratulations.
- You've been doing great.

1180
01:04:49,147 --> 01:04:52,250
She works in media broadcasting
department on campus.

1181
01:04:52,251 --> 01:04:55,111
- Are you an announcer?
- Are you an announcer?

1182
01:04:55,112 --> 01:04:56,865
No, I do this.
(camera man)

1183
01:04:58,321 --> 01:05:01,238
- Can you tell us your name?
- Which one of these members do you like?

1184
01:05:01,239 --> 01:05:03,130
- Yoo Jae Suk.
- That's obvious.

1185
01:05:04,657 --> 01:05:06,245
I'm so sick of hearing that.

1186
01:05:07,970 --> 01:05:09,997
I cried when you got married.

1187
01:05:11,173 --> 01:05:13,183
Why would you cry over such
a happy occasion?

1188
01:05:13,184 --> 01:05:15,377
That is just absolutely absurd.

1189
01:05:16,940 --> 01:05:18,573
Do you want me to make you really sad?

1190
01:05:19,651 --> 01:05:20,871
What's your last name?

1191
01:05:20,872 --> 01:05:22,909
[Her name is...]

1192
01:05:25,759 --> 01:05:27,675
My name is, Na Hyung Jung.

1193
01:05:27,676 --> 01:05:29,180
- 'Na'.
- Oh, 'Na'!

1194
01:05:29,181 --> 01:05:31,139
[Not 'Ra', but 'Na'.]

1195
01:05:34,098 --> 01:05:38,097
[Was a close call, but all six still maintain
their unique last names.]

1196
01:05:39,089 --> 01:05:42,677
All six of them so far
have a different last name.

1197
01:05:42,678 --> 01:05:45,215
- We're going to be okay.
- We've got six of them confirmed now.

1198
01:05:45,216 --> 01:05:49,186
We'll be okay if someone brings either
'Kim' or 'Lee' now.

1199
01:05:49,187 --> 01:05:51,176
- More common names will be okay now.
- There's Suk Jin.

1200
01:05:52,938 --> 01:05:55,457
All six of the women we've brought
all have different surnames so far.

1201
01:05:55,458 --> 01:05:57,583
[All six of them currently have
different surnames.]

1202
01:05:58,691 --> 01:06:01,486
I don't think any of the ladies that are here
will already have this last name.

1203
01:06:01,487 --> 01:06:03,252
What is your last name?

1204
01:06:04,836 --> 01:06:06,669
Ji Jung Eun.

1205
01:06:09,017 --> 01:06:11,136
[An immediate celebration.]

1206
01:06:19,488 --> 01:06:22,498
Your name is Ji Jung Eun?
Is it the same 'Ji'?

1207
01:06:22,499 --> 01:06:23,741
Yes, it's the same 'Ji'.

1208
01:06:23,742 --> 01:06:26,050
I had a feeling that there wouldn't
be any other 'Ji'.

1209
01:06:26,854 --> 01:06:30,646
If anything else, I feel like we're not
going to have any 'Kim' or 'Lee'.

1210
01:06:30,647 --> 01:06:33,045
[No 'Kim', 'Lee', 'Park', 'Choi' so far.]

1211
01:06:33,046 --> 01:06:35,311
- We don't have any 'Choi' either.
- We just won ourselves a hint.

1212
01:06:35,312 --> 01:06:37,669
[Seven successful surnames means that
they've earned themselves a hint.]

1213
01:06:38,684 --> 01:06:40,370
- I can hear Jong Kook's voice.
- Kim Jong Kook is coming.

1214
01:06:40,740 --> 01:06:43,341
<i>- You can't tell them yet, okay?
- He's coaching the woman already?</i>

1215
01:06:43,342 --> 01:06:45,635
There he goes commanding someone again.

1216
01:06:46,789 --> 01:06:49,442
Is it a unique surname, or a common one?

1217
01:06:49,443 --> 01:06:52,502
None of these seven women have
the same last names so far.

1218
01:06:52,503 --> 01:06:53,720
- Really?
- Really.

1219
01:06:53,721 --> 01:06:57,122
- They all have different surnames.
- What is your last name?

1220
01:06:57,123 --> 01:06:59,065
- Can I say my name?
- Is it okay to say it?

1221
01:06:59,066 --> 01:07:01,917
- Yes, you can say it now.
- It starts with a 'K'.

1222
01:07:01,918 --> 01:07:04,072
That's good!
We should be okay!

1223
01:07:04,935 --> 01:07:06,340
Is it, 'Kwak'?

1224
01:07:06,341 --> 01:07:07,500
- What is it?
- Tell them.

1225
01:07:07,501 --> 01:07:09,322
It's, 'Kham'.

1226
01:07:10,598 --> 01:07:13,200
[Oh... 'Kham'!]

1227
01:07:20,525 --> 01:07:25,140
[All eight of them have succeeded so far.]

1228
01:07:25,487 --> 01:07:27,584
We don't have any 'Kim', 'Lee', or
'Park' so far.

1229
01:07:27,585 --> 01:07:30,007
I was thinking that everyone would've
went for the unique

1230
01:07:30,008 --> 01:07:32,177
and if anything else,
common last names would be missing.

1231
01:07:32,178 --> 01:07:35,125
That's what I thought you'd do.
You're so disappointing.

1232
01:07:37,135 --> 01:07:39,346
Why would you feel disappointed when
I've brought the surname, 'Kham'?

1233
01:07:40,194 --> 01:07:42,282
- That's the most unique name so far.
- Kwang Gyu's here.

1234
01:07:43,179 --> 01:07:44,986
Did you bring your daughter or something?

1235
01:07:46,384 --> 01:07:48,741
[A sweet father and daughter duo
entering the room?]

1236
01:07:48,742 --> 01:07:50,210
Is your daughter graduating?

1237
01:07:50,990 --> 01:07:54,706
[What could be the last name of the student
whom Kwang Gyu brought back?]

1238
01:07:54,707 --> 01:07:56,178
All the students here so far
has different last names.

1239
01:07:56,179 --> 01:07:57,327
- They're different?
- Yes.

1240
01:07:57,626 --> 01:08:00,040
[Looking pretty confident.]

1241
01:08:00,041 --> 01:08:03,595
Is it a very common last name,
or is it a very unique last name?

1242
01:08:03,596 --> 01:08:05,631
- It's a common last name.
- No, that's okay!

1243
01:08:06,523 --> 01:08:09,105
- We're okay as long as it's not 'Yoon'.
- What is your last name?

1244
01:08:09,422 --> 01:08:12,087
[What is the common last name that this
student supposedly has?]

1245
01:08:13,464 --> 01:08:15,720
- Yang Hee Kyung.
- 'Yang'!

1246
01:08:17,284 --> 01:08:19,918
[Succeeds again!]

1247
01:08:21,536 --> 01:08:25,727
[All nine of them currently have
a different last name!]

1248
01:08:26,230 --> 01:08:28,000
Yang Hee Kyung!

1249
01:08:28,001 --> 01:08:29,789
Wow, this is amazing.

1250
01:08:31,087 --> 01:08:33,899
- How is this even possible?
- What are you majoring in?

1251
01:08:34,424 --> 01:08:36,326
- Architecture.
- Architecture!

1252
01:08:36,327 --> 01:08:38,529
- Architecture major!
- They're all different.

1253
01:08:38,530 --> 01:08:40,852
[Even all their majors are different!]

1254
01:08:41,793 --> 01:08:44,541
[All of the male contestants seem to
be in perfect sync with one another.]

1255
01:08:46,086 --> 01:08:49,442
[Time to switch out the tape-
A brief time for some rest.]

1256
01:08:51,339 --> 01:08:53,082
- Are we taking a break?
- Yes, we're taking a brief break.

1257
01:08:53,513 --> 01:08:55,069
You're going to put makeup on?

1258
01:08:55,070 --> 01:08:56,928
Why are you putting makeup on?

1259
01:08:57,465 --> 01:08:59,839
- I didn't realize I'd be on TV.
- Your skin looks great right now!

1260
01:09:00,797 --> 01:09:04,107
- Just put something on your lips.
- No, I need some makeup on my face.

1261
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,989
- Okay, then put it on.
- Put it on and we'll do a visual comparison.

1262
01:09:08,876 --> 01:09:10,582
What does your father do?

1263
01:09:12,098 --> 01:09:14,908
Your father's an architect?
Ah, I see.

1264
01:09:17,935 --> 01:09:19,770
Your skin is starting to look brighter.

1265
01:09:19,771 --> 01:09:22,494
- Now that she has it on her face...
- How is it? Is it better?

1266
01:09:22,955 --> 01:09:25,086
She needs to put the eyeliner on too.
Just hang on a minute.

1267
01:09:25,087 --> 01:09:27,378
[Needs a little bit more time.]

1268
01:09:29,264 --> 01:09:30,883
Her eyes have gotten bigger!

1269
01:09:33,212 --> 01:09:38,102
[A woman's transformation that still
fascinates men every time.]

1270
01:09:38,103 --> 01:09:40,350
She would like to know if
you could lend her your eyeliner.

1271
01:09:41,792 --> 01:09:44,029
- She's all done.
- Wow, Jung Eun.

1272
01:09:44,030 --> 01:09:45,316
Her lip color is different too.

1273
01:09:45,929 --> 01:09:48,724
Why are you all staring at her like that?

1274
01:09:49,111 --> 01:09:51,435
Why are you all staring at her?

1275
01:09:51,436 --> 01:09:52,970
Let me see.

1276
01:09:52,971 --> 01:09:54,440
You look very pretty.

1277
01:09:55,392 --> 01:09:57,614
- You should show them.
- You did a good job.

1278
01:09:57,615 --> 01:09:59,094
[I should check too.]

1279
01:10:00,123 --> 01:10:01,938
Our 'Ji' family line.

1280
01:10:04,711 --> 01:10:06,550
Doesn't she look different?
Doesn't she look nice?

1281
01:10:08,063 --> 01:10:10,000
She looks more fierce.

1282
01:10:10,001 --> 01:10:12,413
- I didn't put any B.B cream on.
- You don't have what on?

1283
01:10:12,414 --> 01:10:14,346
- B.B.
- So I don't have as good of a coverage.

1284
01:10:15,354 --> 01:10:16,567
You did good.

1285
01:10:17,519 --> 01:10:20,555
- We're missing Gary and Hyun Moo?
- Yes, Gary and Hyun Moo are still left.

1286
01:10:21,336 --> 01:10:24,503
Anyone with a unique surname?

1287
01:10:24,504 --> 01:10:26,771
- 'Park'!
- You've got one minute left.

1288
01:10:28,572 --> 01:10:30,215
Anyone with a unique last name?

1289
01:10:32,525 --> 01:10:37,459
[There's not much time left on the clock.]

1290
01:10:37,460 --> 01:10:39,808
[Hyun Moo finally seems to have
found something?]

1291
01:10:43,373 --> 01:10:44,988
Here it is!
I've found it!

1292
01:10:44,989 --> 01:10:46,599
Come on.
We need to hurry!

1293
01:10:46,600 --> 01:10:48,143
[Gary seems to have found one too?]

1294
01:10:49,223 --> 01:10:52,843
[What are the surnames that these two will
break through the crowd to bring back?]

1295
01:10:54,697 --> 01:10:56,135
Hyun Moo's here!

1296
01:10:57,760 --> 01:11:01,882
[Gary arrives soon after Hyun Moo.]

1297
01:11:03,956 --> 01:11:05,614
- Please.
- Gary.

1298
01:11:05,615 --> 01:11:07,770
Is it a common last name,
or a unique last name?

1299
01:11:07,771 --> 01:11:09,362
[Totally curious.]

1300
01:11:09,363 --> 01:11:12,840
- That could be more dangerous.
- Very uncommon name in our country.

1301
01:11:12,841 --> 01:11:16,554
I don't think I've heard her surname
in the past six years or so.

1302
01:11:16,555 --> 01:11:17,745
- Seriously?
- Yes.

1303
01:11:17,746 --> 01:11:20,845
I personally don't know a single person
with the same surname that she has.

1304
01:11:20,846 --> 01:11:22,505
- Really?
- Me neither.

1305
01:11:22,506 --> 01:11:25,218
All nine of the ladies so far
have different last names.

1306
01:11:25,219 --> 01:11:26,332
They're all different.

1307
01:11:26,333 --> 01:11:30,042
First of all, we'd like to thank all our
students for participating in our game.

1308
01:11:30,043 --> 01:11:35,744
[Thank you for taking the time out of your
precious schedule to help us out!]

1309
01:11:35,745 --> 01:11:38,767
Everyone prior to Jun Hyun Moo currently
all have different surnames.

1310
01:11:38,768 --> 01:11:41,251
[Everyone has a different surname.]

1311
01:11:42,639 --> 01:11:44,829
[Even their majors are all different!]

1312
01:11:46,512 --> 01:11:49,274
- It's time to check the last two.
- These final two ladies...

1313
01:11:49,275 --> 01:11:50,680
[Time to check the last two surnames.]

1314
01:11:51,813 --> 01:11:55,157
If the last two ladies are different and
all 11 of the ladies have a different surname

1315
01:11:55,158 --> 01:11:57,092
then we win a total of five hints.

1316
01:11:57,093 --> 01:12:00,128
[A total of five hints if the final two
women have a different last names!]

1317
01:12:00,863 --> 01:12:02,605
We're all in such total sync.

1318
01:12:02,606 --> 01:12:05,780
- Why don't we start with Gary?
- Why me?

1319
01:12:05,781 --> 01:12:07,460
[Starting with Gary's student.]

1320
01:12:07,461 --> 01:12:09,259
Her surname is two hyphenated names.

1321
01:12:12,904 --> 01:12:15,225
[Predicting a success?]

1322
01:12:15,226 --> 01:12:18,750
- Please tell us your name.
- I'm a third year student...

1323
01:12:22,854 --> 01:12:25,458
I'm a math major,
and my name is, Jae-Gal Da Eun.

1324
01:12:27,439 --> 01:12:29,654
My name is, Jae-Gal Da Eun.

1325
01:12:29,655 --> 01:12:31,675
[Easily succeeds.]

1326
01:12:35,272 --> 01:12:36,914
That's so unique.

1327
01:12:36,915 --> 01:12:38,691
[Confirms with her student ID.]

1328
01:12:38,692 --> 01:12:40,771
That is such a unique last name.

1329
01:12:41,779 --> 01:12:44,424
Okay, time to revel the final surname.

1330
01:12:44,425 --> 01:12:45,866
[One final person left remaining.]

1331
01:12:45,867 --> 01:12:48,002
Since Da Eun was a success too,
then do we currently have four hints?

1332
01:12:48,799 --> 01:12:50,596
We'll have five hints as long as
the last student's name is different too?

1333
01:12:50,597 --> 01:12:53,424
[If Hyun Moo's student also has a different
surname, then they win a total of five hints!]

1334
01:12:53,802 --> 01:12:55,606
Her surname starts with an 'O'.

1335
01:12:55,607 --> 01:12:57,112
- 'O'?
- What could it be?

1336
01:12:57,113 --> 01:12:59,246
We already have a 'Yoon' and a 'Yang'.

1337
01:13:00,014 --> 01:13:03,478
- 'Eom'? Or 'Wong'?
- There are plenty of other possibilities.

1338
01:13:03,479 --> 01:13:05,321
Her name is Eun Kyung.

1339
01:13:05,322 --> 01:13:06,565
Everyone...

1340
01:13:06,566 --> 01:13:09,515
[What could her surname be?]

1341
01:13:11,064 --> 01:13:12,883
Yook Eun Kyung!

1342
01:13:24,154 --> 01:13:27,049
[Mission is a success!]

1343
01:13:28,025 --> 01:13:31,426
We'd like to thank all of you once again
for your participation.

1344
01:13:32,299 --> 01:13:34,535
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1345
01:13:36,042 --> 01:13:39,773
My name is Yook Eun Kyung,
and I'm a Western Art Painting Major.

1346
01:13:41,263 --> 01:13:43,904
[Everyone succeeded in bringing back
students with different surnames!]

1347
01:13:43,905 --> 01:13:46,248
Why don't you explain to these students
what kind of a race we're doing today?

1348
01:13:46,249 --> 01:13:49,184
We have to earn hints by succeeding
various different missions.

1349
01:13:49,185 --> 01:13:55,709
A question was asked of women from
their teens to their fifties.

1350
01:13:55,710 --> 01:13:57,808
- If they were to date someone...
- After being reborn.

1351
01:13:57,809 --> 01:14:00,865
Which one of us would you want to date
if you were to be born again?

1352
01:14:00,866 --> 01:14:03,719
- In order of the rank.
- And we have to guess the order of rank.

1353
01:14:03,720 --> 01:14:05,323
We'd like to ask all of you here.

1354
01:14:05,645 --> 01:14:07,806
[Since they're here already,
how about asking them the same question?]

1355
01:14:07,807 --> 01:14:11,532
Just tell us the person you'd most
and least want to date.

1356
01:14:11,533 --> 01:14:12,679
This is making me nervous.

1357
01:14:13,136 --> 01:14:18,095
No need to worry about naming people because
we're all very cool about things like this.

1358
01:14:18,096 --> 01:14:20,215
- It's okay, you won't offend us.
- Everyone has their own preference.

1359
01:14:21,294 --> 01:14:24,110
- Is his name, Kim Kwang Goo?
- No, it's Kim Kwang Gyu.

1360
01:14:24,111 --> 01:14:26,741
[His name...]

1361
01:14:29,229 --> 01:14:31,099
What does your father do?

1362
01:14:31,100 --> 01:14:33,335
- What does your father do?
- Calm down.

1363
01:14:33,914 --> 01:14:35,611
She could've meant that you're
in first place with her.

1364
01:14:35,612 --> 01:14:39,168
We'll just go down the line,
and quickly name people

1365
01:14:39,169 --> 01:14:41,881
and we'll all say our goodbyes
after a big round of applause.

1366
01:14:42,386 --> 01:14:45,032
Since we don't know what's about to happen,
let's all take a quick picture first.

1367
01:14:45,033 --> 01:14:47,368
[Time for some pictures first?]

1368
01:14:47,369 --> 01:14:49,072
Okay, take your pictures.

1369
01:14:49,073 --> 01:14:52,638
All the women stay seated where you are,
and the men will go around to different seats.

1370
01:14:54,026 --> 01:14:56,842
[A new picture taking method?]

1371
01:14:56,843 --> 01:14:58,230
We'll just go around clockwise, okay?

1372
01:14:58,231 --> 01:15:01,070
[A revolving photo booth.]

1373
01:15:01,436 --> 01:15:03,192
And if you don't want a picture of
the person standing behind you

1374
01:15:03,193 --> 01:15:04,689
then just shout out, 'Pass'.

1375
01:15:04,690 --> 01:15:06,287
[Shout out, 'Pass', if they don't like
whomever is behind them.]

1376
01:15:09,345 --> 01:15:10,861
Okay, here we go.

1377
01:15:11,642 --> 01:15:14,166
[Time to take some pictures!]

1378
01:15:15,103 --> 01:15:16,988
Okay, next!

1379
01:15:18,771 --> 01:15:22,212
[Move on to the right
after a picture is taken.]

1380
01:15:22,213 --> 01:15:24,084
Keep on moving!

1381
01:15:24,898 --> 01:15:26,266
We don't have much time!

1382
01:15:26,267 --> 01:15:29,802
Stick your face forward, and stop winking!

1383
01:15:32,407 --> 01:15:34,764
[Being overtly cute is prohibited.]

1384
01:15:34,765 --> 01:15:36,596
Why are you doing this?

1385
01:15:37,001 --> 01:15:41,269
[Rotating pictures are now complete.]

1386
01:15:41,270 --> 01:15:43,107
How about a group photo now?

1387
01:15:44,366 --> 01:15:47,254
[A full service.]

1388
01:15:47,255 --> 01:15:48,527
Everyone gather closer!

1389
01:15:49,371 --> 01:15:51,540
Okay, one more picture.

1390
01:15:51,541 --> 01:15:53,033
[Still acting overtly cute.]

1391
01:15:54,390 --> 01:15:57,085
Everyone, smile!

1392
01:15:59,817 --> 01:16:02,474
[11 female students and
popularity contestants.]

1393
01:16:03,793 --> 01:16:07,023
[Time to answer the question of
who they would like to be reborn to date.]

1394
01:16:07,024 --> 01:16:08,335
Get your bags ready and get ready to go
after you answer the question.

1395
01:16:12,924 --> 01:16:15,189
Don't forget your drinks either.

1396
01:16:17,780 --> 01:16:21,118
Thank you everyone once again for your
help and be careful on your way out.

1397
01:16:21,119 --> 01:16:24,876
This show will be broadcasted
in two weeks.

1398
01:16:24,877 --> 01:16:26,858
[Even kindly letting them know
of the broadcasting schedule.]

1399
01:16:26,859 --> 01:16:28,852
Okay, we're going to start now.

1400
01:16:29,443 --> 01:16:32,730
The person you'd want to date the most
if you were to be born again.

1401
01:16:32,731 --> 01:16:34,578
- Yoo Jae Suk.
- Person in last place.

1402
01:16:34,579 --> 01:16:36,552
Person I'd least want to date, Jun Hyun Moo.

1403
01:16:38,499 --> 01:16:39,684
Jun Hyun Moo.

1404
01:16:42,701 --> 01:16:47,687
[Answers the question...
and coolly leaves the room.]

1405
01:16:50,840 --> 01:16:53,029
[Bye!]

1406
01:16:53,465 --> 01:16:57,175
[She really left without even
a single glance backward.]

1407
01:17:00,174 --> 01:17:01,499
You can't glance back.

1408
01:17:02,738 --> 01:17:05,276
- You can't glance back.
- Just keep going.

1409
01:17:07,330 --> 01:17:10,064
[Next student.]

1410
01:17:10,065 --> 01:17:11,611
- First place.
- Yoo Jae Suk.

1411
01:17:11,612 --> 01:17:13,390

[One vote for Muzy.]

1414
01:17:25,348 --> 01:17:26,871
Stop her!

What does your father do!

1419
01:17:41,849 --> 01:17:44,467
[Grief of coming in at last place.]

1420
01:17:47,681 --> 01:17:49,515
Go wait for me outside!

1421
01:17:50,994 --> 01:17:53,816
[Not a single one of them has
glanced back.]

1422
01:17:53,817 --> 01:17:55,286
I love how cool they are.

1423

[A bloody battle for the last place.]

1438
01:18:45,974 --> 01:18:48,165
- First place?
- Yoo Jae Suk.

1439
01:18:48,166 --> 01:18:49,872

[Happy?]

1443
01:19:03,412 --> 01:19:05,302
Look at how happy Hyun Moo is.

1444
01:19:07,844 --> 01:19:09,580
[Battle for the last place-
Kim Kwang Gyu- 4 vs Jung Hyun Moo- 2.]

1445
01:19:09,581 --> 01:19:11,243
- First place?
- Gary.

1446
01:19:11,244 --> 01:19:13,739
- Last place?
- Jun Hyun Moo.

1447
01:19:14,973 --> 01:19:16,422
Jun Hyun Moo.

1448
01:19:16,695 --> 01:19:20,099
[A fight for the last place.]

1449
01:19:23,607 --> 01:19:27,005
[Kim Kwang Gyu- 4 vs Jung Hyun Moo- 3.
Only one vote difference.]

1450
01:19:27,006 --> 01:19:30,303
- First place?
- Jang Ki Ha.

1451
01:19:31,280 --> 01:19:33,157
Last place?

1452
01:19:33,158 --> 01:19:34,989
[Last place...]

1453
01:19:37,010 --> 01:19:38,366
Jun Hyun Moo.

1454
01:19:40,575 --> 01:19:44,427
[The student staying loyal to her 'father'.]

1455
01:19:45,616 --> 01:19:48,235
[4:4- a tie.]

1456
01:19:48,236 --> 01:19:51,238
[A fierce battle comparable to that of
a World Cup game.]

1457
01:19:54,383 --> 01:19:55,868
[Please...]

1458
01:19:58,702 --> 01:20:02,399
[Current score is, 4:4.
Only two people left.]

1459
01:20:02,794 --> 01:20:05,344
- You've made up your mind, right?
- No one's even interested in first place.

1460
01:20:06,012 --> 01:20:07,772
- First place.
- Ha Ha.

1461
01:20:10,004 --> 01:20:11,950
Last place?

1462
01:20:11,951 --> 01:20:13,903
[Who will she pick to be in the last place?]

1463
01:20:18,344 --> 01:20:20,028
Jun Hyun Moo.

1464
01:20:24,137 --> 01:20:27,734
[A reversal!]

1465
01:20:31,387 --> 01:20:34,490
[Already in celebration mode.]

1466
01:20:35,659 --> 01:20:39,216
[All worked up.]

1467
01:20:40,538 --> 01:20:41,871
I was the one who brought you here!

1468
01:20:41,956 --> 01:20:45,223
[Having been given the last place vote
by the student he brought himself.]

1469
01:20:45,224 --> 01:20:46,762
I brought you here!

1470
01:20:46,763 --> 01:20:48,121
Miss Yook!

1471
01:20:48,122 --> 01:20:49,696
Miss Yook!

1472
01:20:51,039 --> 01:20:53,871
[Miss Yook, staying true to her feelings.]

1473
01:20:53,872 --> 01:20:55,701
- I brought you here.
- He's the one who brought her here.

1474
01:20:55,702 --> 01:20:57,709
I was the one who brought her here,
and I liked her too!

1475
01:20:58,373 --> 01:21:00,490
How she must've hated being
dragged here by him.

1476
01:21:00,491 --> 01:21:04,884
- This is so funny.
- Okay, step up to the front.

1477
01:21:04,885 --> 01:21:07,171
[Kwang Gyu- 4 vs. Hyun Moo-5.
One final vote left.]

1478
01:21:07,172 --> 01:21:12,168
The person that just walked out of here
is the student that Hyun Moo brought.

1479
01:21:12,169 --> 01:21:15,130
[Voted by the student that he,
himself brought.]

1480
01:21:15,901 --> 01:21:17,804
She must've come here to see me.

1481
01:21:18,192 --> 01:21:21,963
This vote will determine whether you'll tie
or solidify Hyun Moo's status.

1482
01:21:21,964 --> 01:21:23,742
[Will they be in last place together,
or will Hyun Moo stand alone?]

1483
01:21:23,743 --> 01:21:25,862
- First place?
- Gary.

1484
01:21:25,863 --> 01:21:27,678
It's because Gary brought her.

1485
01:21:27,679 --> 01:21:29,742
Last place?

1486
01:21:30,370 --> 01:21:33,745
[Who will come in at last place?]

1487
01:21:36,027 --> 01:21:37,605
Jun Hyun Moo.

1488
01:21:41,583 --> 01:21:45,891
[His status is solidified.]

1489
01:21:45,892 --> 01:21:48,942
This place is on fire right now!

1490
01:21:49,896 --> 01:21:53,584
[Same atmosphere as when
Team Korea won the World Cup.]

1491
01:21:55,728 --> 01:22:03,396
Thanks to all the students and everyone else
who came out to see us, and joined us today!

1492
01:22:07,564 --> 01:22:10,516
Today's last place winner that you
helped choose yourselves.

1493
01:22:10,517 --> 01:22:11,946
Jun Hyun Moo!

1494
01:22:11,947 --> 01:22:14,632
[Jun Hyun Moo- Last place holder that
the 11 students chose themselves.]

1495
01:22:17,310 --> 01:22:19,817
This is the first time I've ever been made
to tear up while doing a variety show.

1496
01:22:20,231 --> 01:22:24,791
Since all 11 of those students were
brought here by different members

1497
01:22:24,792 --> 01:22:27,418
and the mission was a success,
you've won a total of five hints.

1498
01:22:27,419 --> 01:22:29,695
[Gained five hints from having
succeeded the mission.]

1499
01:22:30,290 --> 01:22:32,295
Hyun Moo can pick all five hints.

1500
01:22:33,290 --> 01:22:35,399
Hyun Moo was given five votes.

1501
01:22:35,400 --> 01:22:37,609
Since he's lost so much today.

1502
01:22:38,914 --> 01:22:40,944
- Intermediate hint 7.
- That's not bad.

1503
01:22:41,817 --> 01:22:46,013
[Hyun Moo appears to be more
down than usual?]

1504
01:22:46,014 --> 01:22:47,641
Why don't you do it while doing
a SHINee dance?

1505
01:22:47,642 --> 01:22:49,673
- Have some fun.
- You're all so cruel.

1506
01:22:50,043 --> 01:22:53,198
You could be making the viewers think
that you're really upset or something.

1507
01:22:53,199 --> 01:22:55,011
I am upset.

1508
01:22:55,012 --> 01:22:57,551
[The music is already playing...]

1509
01:22:57,552 --> 01:23:00,273
[Immediately starts to dance!]

1510
01:23:03,161 --> 01:23:04,796
You have to shout it out.

1511
01:23:08,175 --> 01:23:10,996
[Premiere hint 4.]

1512
01:23:13,058 --> 01:23:16,070
[His special dance to chase
all the sadness away.]

1513
01:23:22,431 --> 01:23:25,463
[It's back!
The flashy footsteps!]

1514
01:23:29,664 --> 01:23:32,282
[And finishes it off with a cute pose.]

1515
01:23:34,409 --> 01:23:36,186
Isn't it so much easier to take
the pictures like that?

1516
01:23:38,445 --> 01:23:41,004
- That was hilarious, Jae Suk.
- That was much easier on those students.

1517
01:23:41,005 --> 01:23:44,692
I think we're going to know our answers
for sure once we see the other hints.

1518
01:23:45,549 --> 01:23:49,107
But seeing those 11 female students earlier,
I can see how I came in at last place.

1519
01:23:49,108 --> 01:23:51,548
- You shouldn't let that bother you.
- That was just a joke.

1520
01:23:51,549 --> 01:23:54,435
I knew that I may come in at last place
and I just accepted the fact.

1521
01:23:54,436 --> 01:23:57,597
[Hyun Moo having sacrificed himself
for the sake of his teammates.]

1522
01:23:57,598 --> 01:23:59,662
- I predict I'll come in at last place.
- Me too.

1523
01:23:59,663 --> 01:24:01,463
What are you saying?
That you agree with him?

1524
01:24:01,464 --> 01:24:03,517
Then I think I'll come in at 9th place.

1525
01:24:03,518 --> 01:24:05,523
- I'm most curious about the last place.
- Me too.

1526
01:24:05,524 --> 01:24:09,404
- After what just happened to Hyun Moo.
- I couldn't believe that happened.

1527
01:24:09,405 --> 01:24:12,828
- After what just happened...
- I wonder if Hyun Moo's really sad?

1528
01:24:14,707 --> 01:24:17,473
[Seoul Mok-Dong.
SBS Broadcasting Station.]

1529
01:24:18,296 --> 01:24:22,054
[Only the moment of the final decision is left.]

1530
01:24:24,253 --> 01:24:26,393
- It's the water drop?
- What?

1531
01:24:27,796 --> 01:24:29,696
- It's the water dump!
- The water.

1532
01:24:36,766 --> 01:24:39,732
[Eleven water bombs.]

1533
01:24:41,822 --> 01:24:44,374
Two low hints, one intermediate hint,
and two top hints.

1534
01:24:45,591 --> 01:24:48,728
The top five ranking positions.

1535
01:24:48,729 --> 01:24:50,567
There are a lot of singers in those ranks.

1536
01:24:50,568 --> 01:24:52,776
How about all the singers raise their hands?

1537
01:24:52,777 --> 01:24:54,491
I think the two of us will be up there.

1538
01:24:54,492 --> 01:24:56,358
- Not you.
- I don't think it'll be you.

1539
01:24:56,359 --> 01:24:59,538
So if there are three singers of the five,
then it's the correct count.

1540
01:24:59,539 --> 01:25:01,432
Then Gary has to be in second place.

1541
01:25:01,433 --> 01:25:03,737
[Gary seems to be in second place?]

1542
01:25:03,738 --> 01:25:06,320
<i>[There are two guest members amongst
the first five ranking positions.]</i>

1543
01:25:07,363 --> 01:25:10,760
[Two guest members
in the five upper ranking positions.]

1544
01:25:11,106 --> 01:25:13,027
- I'm in fourth place.
- What about after that?

1545
01:25:13,681 --> 01:25:15,717
Then Ki Ha must be in third place.

1546
01:25:15,718 --> 01:25:17,885
[Ki Ha in third place?]

1547
01:25:19,240 --> 01:25:22,739
[Possible third place contestant is feeling
saddened by this new development?]

1548
01:25:22,740 --> 01:25:24,680
He thought that he was
going to be in third place.

1549
01:25:24,681 --> 01:25:26,530
It's possible that I'm not in first place.

1550
01:25:27,858 --> 01:25:31,968
<i>[People in 2nd, 4th, 9th, and 10th
are known by their stage names.]</i>

1551
01:25:31,969 --> 01:25:34,071
Then this just confirmed that
Muzy is in 10th place.

1552
01:25:34,072 --> 01:25:35,535
[Muzy's in 10th place?]

1553
01:25:35,536 --> 01:25:37,893
- Second place is Gary.
- Lee Juck is in fourth place?

1554
01:25:37,894 --> 01:25:39,306
Lee Juck is in fourth place.

1555
01:25:39,307 --> 01:25:40,937
Then Jong Kook must be in fifth place.

1556
01:25:40,938 --> 01:25:43,272
- Then 9th place must be...
- It's me, Ha Ha.

1557
01:25:43,273 --> 01:25:45,738
- Then Muzy really is in 10th place.
- That's right.

1558
01:25:46,514 --> 01:25:48,216
You're in 9th place?

1559
01:25:49,869 --> 01:25:51,829
- Third place is Jang Ki Ha.
- Yes, that must be Ki Ha.

1560
01:25:52,423 --> 01:25:54,256
It could be Jun Hyun Moo.

1561
01:25:55,919 --> 01:25:57,485
Let's see the top level hint.

1562
01:25:57,486 --> 01:25:58,904
[Time to reveal the top hint.]

1563
01:25:58,905 --> 01:26:04,867
[Ha Ha, Jang Ki Ha, Ji Suk Jin, Jun Hyun Moo,
and Kim Jong Kook are in odd numbered spot.]

1564
01:26:06,005 --> 01:26:08,915
[Ha Ha's spot in 9th position is solidified?]

1565
01:26:08,916 --> 01:26:11,476
[Ki Ha's position in 3rd spot also
seems to be solidified.]

1566
01:26:11,477 --> 01:26:13,326
- Then am I in 11th place?
- No, you're in 7th.

1567
01:26:13,361 --> 01:26:15,861
- Write your name down in there for now.
- Why am I so high up in rank?

1568
01:26:16,387 --> 01:26:20,118
Ji Suk Jin and Jun Hyun Moo could both
be in either the 7th or the 11th position.

1569
01:26:20,119 --> 01:26:21,670
[Confusing 7th and 11th spot.]

1570
01:26:21,671 --> 01:26:23,516
Erase your name out of there.

1571
01:26:23,517 --> 01:26:25,690
Erase it for now since
we're not sure of it right now.

1572
01:26:26,146 --> 01:26:28,615
[Kwang Gyu's position in
8th position is solidified.]

1573
01:26:29,059 --> 01:26:31,092
I lost out to Kwang Gyu?

1574
01:26:33,018 --> 01:26:36,451
[An unforeseen circumstance.]

1575
01:26:37,602 --> 01:26:40,552
Hyun Moo and I are both candidates for
both 7th and 11th position.

1576
01:26:40,553 --> 01:26:42,394
I could be in 1st place.

1577
01:26:44,924 --> 01:26:46,350
Why are you all reacting like that?

1578
01:26:46,351 --> 01:26:49,326
I think this is my spot,
and Hyun Moo's in the last position.

1579
01:26:49,327 --> 01:26:50,950
[Key to winning this race is to figure out
which spot Hyun Moo and Suk Jin are in.]

1580
01:26:50,951 --> 01:26:55,244
[The fate rides on their one single decision.]

1581
01:26:55,245 --> 01:26:56,968
We just need to figure out
Hyun Moo and Suk Jin's positions.

1582
01:26:56,969 --> 01:27:00,067
- I don't know what to do.
- If Hyun Moo is put in the last spot...

1583
01:27:00,410 --> 01:27:02,081
If you're in last spot and we get drenched,
then it's a good thing for you.

1584
01:27:02,082 --> 01:27:04,267
- You should be happy about that happening.
- I don't know which is better.

1585
01:27:06,772 --> 01:27:08,849
- I think it's a toss-up.
- Best I'll be is 7th place.

1586
01:27:08,850 --> 01:27:12,317
You're complaining?
That's a huge difference from my spot.

1587
01:27:12,823 --> 01:27:15,842
- Look at the place that I'm in.
- Okay, Hyun Moo is going to move down.

1588
01:27:15,843 --> 01:27:19,180
[Then everyone is agreeing that Hyun Moo
should move down to last place?]

1589
01:27:19,181 --> 01:27:22,226
You're sacrificing yourself for the team.
You're being very gracious right now.

1590
01:27:22,227 --> 01:27:23,889
This is you being gracious.

1591
01:27:28,003 --> 01:27:31,308
I don't know if we're going to get
the water dumped on us or not...

1592
01:27:31,309 --> 01:27:35,391
- Our teamwork was amazing.
- Our teamwork was great, and it was a blast.

1593
01:27:35,392 --> 01:27:38,459
[Results aside, their teamwork today
was something to be very proud of.]

1594
01:27:38,900 --> 01:27:41,992
[Time to head up to the final judging stage.]

1595
01:27:43,601 --> 01:27:46,780
[Would they have gotten
the correct answer?]

1596
01:27:47,856 --> 01:27:51,738
[Their nervousness is compounded tenfold
once they're on the stage.]

1597
01:27:52,958 --> 01:27:55,541
It's time to make your final decisions.

1598
01:27:55,542 --> 01:27:58,257
Is this your final decision?

1599
01:28:02,397 --> 01:28:05,677
[7th and 11th place that
the team isn't too sure of.]

1600
01:28:05,678 --> 01:28:07,134
What are you going to do?

1601
01:28:07,135 --> 01:28:08,453
Are you sure that Suk Jin is in 11th place?

1602
01:28:08,454 --> 01:28:11,734
If we hadn't done that impromptu voting
at the school earlier...

1603
01:28:12,089 --> 01:28:15,525
- If we hadn't done that earlier...
- Then it would've been different.

1604
01:28:17,054 --> 01:28:23,103
I think the impromptu voting we did earlier
gave us a very useful insight to this answer.

1605
01:28:24,691 --> 01:28:28,434
I'm the least popular with single,
unwed women in their twenties.

1606
01:28:29,426 --> 01:28:31,598
I'm the least popular with them.
I'm serious.

1607
01:28:31,599 --> 01:28:35,266
Older women really love me.

1608
01:28:35,267 --> 01:28:38,172
[Big-nosed Brother keeping his faith
in the middle aged women?]

1609
01:28:39,591 --> 01:28:41,953
I think we've got the right order though.

1610
01:28:41,954 --> 01:28:44,757
Listen, no matter what the answer,
I do feel pretty pathetic right now.

1611
01:28:44,758 --> 01:28:46,896
I can't believe I got pushed down
to the very last spot.

1612
01:28:47,946 --> 01:28:49,736
[For the sake of the team's victory...]

1613
01:28:49,737 --> 01:28:53,211
No matter what, this still means that we're the
top 11 most popular men in all of Korea.

1614
01:28:53,728 --> 01:28:56,213
[That's Ha Ha's way of comforting Hyun Moo.]

1615
01:28:56,214 --> 01:28:59,937
[With an emphasis on his own image.]

1616
01:29:00,723 --> 01:29:02,517
I think Hyun Moo should be
moved over to 7th place.

1617
01:29:04,702 --> 01:29:10,166
[Hyun Moo and Suk Jin to ultimately
switch out their spots?]

1618
01:29:13,385 --> 01:29:15,059
No, this isn't right!

1619
01:29:15,060 --> 01:29:18,275
[Hyun Moo's rival vehemently
opposing this switch?]

1620
01:29:20,500 --> 01:29:22,332
We're going to get started now.

1621
01:29:22,333 --> 01:29:29,537
Five, four, three, two...

1622
01:29:29,538 --> 01:29:31,249
Make your final decision!

1623
01:29:34,517 --> 01:29:37,159
- The lights have been turned on.
- We've had great teamwork today.

1624
01:29:37,681 --> 01:29:41,033
[Since they've had such great teamwork
all day today...]

1625
01:29:41,034 --> 01:29:42,643
Final decision!

1626
01:29:42,644 --> 01:29:44,931
[This is their final decision.]

1627
01:29:44,932 --> 01:29:47,325
We will start with the first place.

1628
01:29:48,303 --> 01:29:49,810
First place.

1629
01:29:49,811 --> 01:29:50,963
[If the light on the number turns blue,
then it's the correct answer.]

1630
01:29:51,480 --> 01:29:55,943
[First place prediction- Yoo Jae Suk.]

1631
01:29:55,944 --> 01:29:57,945
[Correct]

1632
01:30:00,671 --> 01:30:02,327
Onto second place.

1633
01:30:02,328 --> 01:30:03,617
Second place.

1634
01:30:03,618 --> 01:30:08,653
[Second place prediction- Gary.]

1635
01:30:08,654 --> 01:30:10,374
[Correct]

1636
01:30:10,866 --> 01:30:12,026
Third place.

1637
01:30:12,027 --> 01:30:15,203
[Giraffe is still upset about
having lost his spot in third place?]

1638
01:30:15,204 --> 01:30:16,674
It's not you!

1639
01:30:19,536 --> 01:30:21,090
Why are you getting mad over that?

1640
01:30:21,390 --> 01:30:28,732
[Third place prediction- Jang Ki Ha.]

1641
01:30:28,767 --> 01:30:30,854
[Correct]

1642
01:30:34,325 --> 01:30:36,324
[Disappointed?]

1643
01:30:37,064 --> 01:30:39,142
We will now reveal the fourth place.

1644
01:30:40,470 --> 01:30:45,887
[Fourth place prediction- Lee Juck.]

1645
01:30:45,922 --> 01:30:47,955
[Correct]

1646
01:30:47,956 --> 01:30:50,368
Then I must be in the correct spot.
I'm in the right spot.

1647
01:30:50,369 --> 01:30:53,402
- Fifth place.
- He's in the right spot.

1648
01:30:54,026 --> 01:30:55,918
[Fifth place is also correct.]

1649
01:30:55,919 --> 01:30:57,190
Sixth place.

1650
01:30:59,332 --> 01:31:01,764
[Sixth place is also correct.]

1651
01:31:04,521 --> 01:31:07,777
[It's now time for the fateful
seventh place.]

1652
01:31:08,516 --> 01:31:11,746
Since we don't know the seventh place yet,
we'll first move on to the eighth place.

1653
01:31:12,090 --> 01:31:14,536
[MC Blank is doing a great job.]

1654
01:31:14,537 --> 01:31:16,945
I'm really nervous about this too.

1655
01:31:17,553 --> 01:31:19,344
Kim Kwang Gyu in eighth place.

1656
01:31:22,110 --> 01:31:24,441
[Correct answer]

1657
01:31:25,335 --> 01:31:26,806
Ninth place.

1658
01:31:27,416 --> 01:31:28,977
That is also correct.

1659
01:31:33,156 --> 01:31:35,847
[Tenth place is also correct.]

1660
01:31:37,869 --> 01:31:41,756
[Now it's down to 7th and 11th place.]

1661
01:31:41,757 --> 01:31:45,158
[Will their answer be correct?]

1662
01:31:46,849 --> 01:31:49,805
[They can't stop chattering from
their nervous energy.]

1663
01:31:49,806 --> 01:31:51,611
Keep it down!

1664
01:31:52,145 --> 01:31:54,927
[MC Blank explodes
from their chaotic chatter.]

1665
01:31:55,225 --> 01:31:58,581
- You know what this feels like too!
- I know, but keep it down some.

1666
01:31:58,582 --> 01:32:00,402
How old are you?

1667
01:32:03,362 --> 01:32:05,026
Anyway... MC Blank.

1668
01:32:05,027 --> 01:32:06,821
Let's just keep going
even if we don't get this.

1669
01:32:06,822 --> 01:32:08,584
[Their motto for the day?]

1670
01:32:08,948 --> 01:32:10,846
I will now announce the
7th and 11th place.

1671
01:32:12,325 --> 01:32:15,779
[Time...]

1672
01:32:15,780 --> 01:32:19,573
[To reveal the final results.]

1673
01:32:19,574 --> 01:32:20,803
Show us the results!

1674
01:32:20,804 --> 01:32:23,014
[This will determine whether they'll
come out victors or losers.]

1675
01:32:23,993 --> 01:32:25,844
[Just what will the results reveal?]

1676
01:32:25,845 --> 01:32:28,756
[Did they guess correctly?]

1677
01:32:33,430 --> 01:32:37,538
Please show us the results!

1678
01:32:38,716 --> 01:32:39,816
[Jun Hyun Moo is 7th place?]

1679
01:32:39,817 --> 01:32:41,907
[With Ji Suk Jin in 11th place?]

1680
01:32:54,150 --> 01:32:57,686
[Correct]

1681
01:33:09,107 --> 01:33:15,523
[Succeeds in guessing the correct answer!]

1682
01:33:15,524 --> 01:33:17,106
I'm not happy!

1683
01:33:22,248 --> 01:33:24,581
[Automatically breaking out in applause.]

1684
01:33:25,765 --> 01:33:28,946
It was fantastic team play today.

1685
01:33:28,947 --> 01:33:33,935
[Fantastic teamwork that they won't
soon be able to forget.]

1686
01:33:33,936 --> 01:33:35,919
Let's all stay cool and say goodbye.

1687
01:33:35,920 --> 01:33:41,639
As we mentioned earlier, we thank everyone
who participated in our show today.

1688

<i>[Thank you to everyone
