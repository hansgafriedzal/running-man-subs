<i>[The Christmas Nightmare]</i>

3
00:00:10,586 --> 00:00:14,909
[One rainy day in December...]

4
00:00:17,251 --> 00:00:18,776
What are you doing here?

5
00:00:20,035 --> 00:00:21,529
What are you doing in front
of my house?

6
00:00:21,861 --> 00:00:24,538
<i>You will be doing individual missions today.</i>

7
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:25,973
Really?

8
00:00:30,949 --> 00:00:32,307
Good morning.

9
00:00:33,588 --> 00:00:35,133
Why are you doing that to me?

10
00:00:36,231 --> 00:00:37,462
What is this?

11
00:00:37,737 --> 00:00:40,115
[What is their mission for the day?]

12
00:00:40,116 --> 00:00:42,107
You'll be calling on this
to give us our orders?

13
00:00:42,644 --> 00:00:46,165
I'm not going to ask
what's going to be happening today.

14
00:00:50,008 --> 00:00:52,044
Wow... that's quite a bit of money.

15
00:00:52,045 --> 00:00:53,598
I got a message.

16
00:00:54,685 --> 00:00:59,244
<i>[Couple off in pairs and
come to the bakery in Gangnam.]</i>

17
00:00:59,364 --> 00:01:03,807
[Couple off in pairs and
meet at the bakery in Gangnam!]

18
00:01:03,808 --> 00:01:06,535
I still remember how Ha Ha tricked me
for our last year's Christmas special.

19
00:01:06,536 --> 00:01:10,081
[The Christmas nightmare he's reminded of
whenever he thinks about being paired off?]

20
00:01:10,353 --> 00:01:12,490
<i>The customer you are trying to reach
is on the other line...</i>

21
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:14,819
Gary.

22
00:01:18,975 --> 00:01:22,889
Is this fate or something? Why is
Kang Gary's phone the only one ringing?

23
00:01:23,483 --> 00:01:26,475
I've tried calling others, but Gary's
call is the only one going through.

24
00:01:26,705 --> 00:01:29,833
- I have to go to the bathroom real quick.
- Make it quick.

25
00:01:31,083 --> 00:01:33,255
Take the phone with you,
and answer the call if it rings.

26
00:01:33,256 --> 00:01:35,429
[Hands the phone back...]

27
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:36,977
Take the call if you're able to.

28
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:40,138
You have to answer
the phone if it starts to ring.

29
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,765
My phone's ringing.
Who is it?

30
00:01:45,136 --> 00:01:48,325
[Who could be calling at a time like this?]

31
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:53,643
Hello?

32
00:01:56,309 --> 00:01:58,383
Are you really going to talk
to me like that?

33
00:01:58,384 --> 00:02:00,456
<i>Hello?
Is this Song Ji Hyo?</i>

34
00:02:00,457 --> 00:02:02,221
Are you going to talk to me
so roughly like that?

35
00:02:02,222 --> 00:02:05,353
No, I had a feeling it would be you.

36
00:02:05,354 --> 00:02:06,929
Where are you, Gary?

37
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:08,846
I'm out in front of my house right now.

38
00:02:08,847 --> 00:02:10,408
[Her voice is making him forget about
his urgency to go to the bathroom.]

39
00:02:10,409 --> 00:02:12,268
Who are you going to partner up
with today?

40
00:02:12,269 --> 00:02:14,307
Just accept that you and I

41
00:02:14,342 --> 00:02:18,630
are a couple every Monday
until the day we die.

42
00:02:18,631 --> 00:02:19,762
Well, I...

43
00:02:19,763 --> 00:02:22,301
Even if you get married, you need to come
sleep over at my place on Mondays.

44
00:02:22,302 --> 00:02:25,790
[You're mine on Mondays...]

45
00:02:25,791 --> 00:02:28,906
This is no time to be joking around right now.
Tell me where you are.

46
00:02:28,907 --> 00:02:30,642
- Tell me where you are.
- I told you that I'm in Apgujeong.

47
00:02:30,643 --> 00:02:33,967
Apgujeong?
Where in Apgujeong are you?

48
00:02:33,968 --> 00:02:35,757
Can you come to where I am instead?

49
00:02:35,783 --> 00:02:38,874
Or how about we meet at that train station
in Gangnam instead?

50
00:02:38,875 --> 00:02:40,630
- How about there?
- Meet in the middle?

51
00:02:40,631 --> 00:02:42,418
How about in front of that cafe?

52
00:02:42,419 --> 00:02:45,043
<i>Okay, then I'll wait for you there.
Hurry up, okay?</i>

53
00:02:45,044 --> 00:02:49,346
<i>You remember the cafe where you bought me
the caramel macchiato from, right?</i>

54
00:02:51,186 --> 00:02:53,611
- Turn around and look behind you.
- You want me to turn around?

55
00:02:53,612 --> 00:02:55,404
[Ji Hyo... do you remember?]

56
00:02:55,405 --> 00:02:58,106
- Why are you telling me to turn around?
- Just turn around.

57
00:02:59,613 --> 00:03:04,400
[The Christmas that felt warmer
than any other Christmas' in the past...]

58
00:03:04,803 --> 00:03:08,042
This is no time to be reminiscing
about the past. Just get on the road.

59
00:03:08,043 --> 00:03:10,045
- Okay.
- Okay.

60
00:03:12,439 --> 00:03:15,990
[Heading straight to the bathroom
as soon as he's off the phone.]

61
00:03:20,174 --> 00:03:21,591
Thank you.

62
00:03:22,037 --> 00:03:23,645
Hello.

63
00:03:29,479 --> 00:03:31,297
A place full of memories.

64
00:03:32,715 --> 00:03:37,715
This is the place where
I betrayed Kang Gary...

65
00:03:37,716 --> 00:03:40,489
and gave him my affection,
as well as sadness.

66
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:43,573
[The place where she left Gary memories
of both joy and sadness.]

67
00:03:47,948 --> 00:03:51,389
Kang Gary may be hungry when
he gets here.

68
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:54,003
One for me, and one for Gary.

69
00:03:58,857 --> 00:04:02,115
[Gary... please come to me.]

70
00:04:07,131 --> 00:04:08,609
Hi.

71
00:04:09,267 --> 00:04:10,661
Where are you?

72
00:04:11,725 --> 00:04:13,605
You're pooping?

73
00:04:14,803 --> 00:04:16,609
Where are you?

74
00:04:18,474 --> 00:04:21,083
No, no.
Where's the bathroom you're in?

75
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:24,874
You're still at the house?

76
00:04:25,245 --> 00:04:26,604
Okay, Gary.

77
00:04:26,889 --> 00:04:29,156
Finish pooping quickly,
and call me back.

78
00:04:30,783 --> 00:04:32,135
Hurry up, okay?

79
00:04:35,744 --> 00:04:38,465
Gary's still at his house right now,
and he's...

80
00:04:38,466 --> 00:04:40,067
He's on the toilet.

81
00:04:42,321 --> 00:04:46,461
[Gary heads off to do his mission with
a much lighter body and spirit.]

82
00:04:46,578 --> 00:04:48,670
I have to go to the cafe first.

83
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:54,805
I'm going to text this picture to Gary.

84
00:04:55,938 --> 00:04:58,151
I'm going to tell him to come quickly
because I've bought him a treat.

85
00:05:22,724 --> 00:05:25,103
Kang Gary's not answering his phone.

86
00:05:29,173 --> 00:05:31,948

is unavailable...</i>

87

88

[Just where in the world are you?]

89
00:05:47,215 --> 00:05:51,330
[To a place where Gary's joy
and sadness was once felt...]

90
00:05:51,331 --> 00:05:55,251
[Add on an order of Ji Hyo's sadness.]

91
00:05:56,504 --> 00:06:00,111
[Destination- 'P' Bakery in Gangnam.]

92

[Yoo-Lee-Ji trio makes their appearance.]

93
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:07,668
Thank you.

94
00:06:08,092 --> 00:06:09,729
- Where is this place?
- I know this place!

95
00:06:17,946 --> 00:06:20,990
- Let's all...
- A couple must walk in hand-in-hand.

96
00:06:20,991 --> 00:06:23,495
[Must walk in hand-in-hand for them
to be acknowledged as a couple.]

97
00:06:24,093 --> 00:06:27,478
- Where's everyone else?
- I don't know who to walk in with.

98
00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:29,187
- Let's give the others a call.
- Should we try calling others?

99
00:06:29,188 --> 00:06:31,711
Okay, let's give the others a call.
One, two, three.

100
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:34,182
One, two, three.

101
00:06:35,316 --> 00:06:37,328
- Go on and give them a call.
- Let's try giving them a call.

102
00:06:38,049 --> 00:06:39,861
Let's see where they're at.

103
00:06:39,862 --> 00:06:42,169
Don't act so antsy.

104
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:47,754
Which one of us three do you all think
will be left all alone?

105
00:06:47,755 --> 00:06:49,381
<i>Yoo Jae Suk!</i>

106
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,318
- A lot of them seem to think that way.
- You think?

107
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:55,816
- I see someone.
- Where?

108
00:07:02,086 --> 00:07:04,711
[Fighting amongst each other.]

109
00:07:06,016 --> 00:07:09,108
- You don't have to hesitate right now.
- We don't need to do it like this.

110
00:07:10,351 --> 00:07:13,394
[Are they playing around?]

111
00:07:16,255 --> 00:07:18,922
You're probably wondering what we're doing,
but you'll find out once this show airs.

112
00:07:21,789 --> 00:07:23,505
- Someone's coming.
- Where?

113
00:07:24,546 --> 00:07:25,873
Move!

114
00:07:25,874 --> 00:07:28,436
[Just then, Kkuk and Haroro
show up on the scene.]

115
00:07:28,437 --> 00:07:30,255
- You two are together?
- I said, get out of the way.

116
00:07:30,256 --> 00:07:32,896
- Move out of the way so that we can go in.
- I said, get out of our way!

117
00:07:32,897 --> 00:07:34,585
Get out of the way!

118
00:07:35,981 --> 00:07:38,453
Out!
Get out of our way!

119
00:07:39,338 --> 00:07:41,242
- What are you doing?
- Get out of our way!

120

[Big-nosed Brother giving
the Tiger the eye.]

121

Get out of my way.

122
00:07:44,233 --> 00:07:45,967
Get out of the way.

123
00:07:49,074 --> 00:07:50,755
Out of my way!

124

[Big-nose and Jae Suk succeed
entering as a couple.]

125

[I can't be left alone like this...]

127
00:08:07,071 --> 00:08:10,427
[Kkuk and Haroro succeed as a couple.]

128
00:08:10,428 --> 00:08:12,159
<i>You have to step outside, Kwang Soo.</i>

129
00:08:17,218 --> 00:08:18,808
Is it okay if we eat this?

130
00:08:18,809 --> 00:08:20,974
- We can eat this, right?
- Go on and eat.

131
00:08:20,975 --> 00:08:24,059
[A table full of delicious
baked goods for the couples.]

132
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:26,739
I can't believe they're coupled off again.

133
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:29,531
- What can I get for you?
- Let's just eat whatever is in front of us.

134
00:08:29,532 --> 00:08:31,286
[No matter what the others say,
Kkuk and Haroro are a good match.]

135
00:08:32,761 --> 00:08:34,996
I have a feeling that things are going to
get really entertaining out there.

136
00:08:34,997 --> 00:08:37,369
[All the couples are in
comfortable viewing mode.]

137
00:08:37,744 --> 00:08:39,619
The other three are going to gather
out front in a few.

138
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:41,617
Hurry!

139
00:08:41,618 --> 00:08:43,228
Hurry!
What's taking you so long!

140
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:46,187
Where have you been?

141
00:08:46,452 --> 00:08:50,365
- Where's Gary?
- I don't know! He stood me up!

142
00:08:50,366 --> 00:08:52,661
- Where's Gary?
- Forget Gary!

143
00:08:52,662 --> 00:08:55,691
[Just where in the world did Gary go?]

144
00:08:56,495 --> 00:08:58,473
- Where's Gary?
- What the heck?

145
00:08:59,948 --> 00:09:01,453
What is this?

146
00:09:01,454 --> 00:09:04,407
[Totally unexpected!
Ji Hyo and Kwang Soo are a couple!]

147
00:09:04,408 --> 00:09:05,696
- What happened?
- What happened to Gary?

148
00:09:05,697 --> 00:09:08,133
- This is not what I expected.
- Kang Gary stood me up.

149
00:09:08,134 --> 00:09:10,168
- Seriously?
- Gary's not even answering his phone.

150
00:09:10,169 --> 00:09:12,231
- He's not even answering his phone.
- What is this?

151
00:09:12,232 --> 00:09:14,904
Kwang Soo!
This really ended working well for you.

152
00:09:14,905 --> 00:09:18,508
[Congratulations to Kwang Soo for escaping
his single-dom.]

153
00:09:19,766 --> 00:09:21,627
This is a very happy ending for him.

154
00:09:21,628 --> 00:09:24,740
- Why won't Gary answer his call?
- I tried calling, but he won't answer.

155
00:09:24,741 --> 00:09:28,898
Gary was on the toilet at his house
when I talked to him earlier on the phone.

156
00:09:30,407 --> 00:09:32,353
[Suk Jin tries calling Gary...]

157
00:09:32,354 --> 00:09:34,894
- What's going on here?
- Maybe Gary's running late.

158
00:09:36,854 --> 00:09:39,246
What's this?
Isn't that Gary's phone?

159
00:09:39,247 --> 00:09:42,566
[What is Gary's phone doing here?]

160
00:09:42,567 --> 00:09:43,914
- Answer the phone.
- See if it really is his phone.

161
00:09:44,914 --> 00:09:46,716
Answer the phone.
Hello?

162
00:09:46,717 --> 00:09:49,367
- Hello?
- That is Gary's phone.

163
00:09:49,368 --> 00:09:50,875

- What's going on here?

[Where did Gary go...
and what is his phone doing here?]

00:10:04,393 --> 00:10:05,827
- What is this?
- Come on.

167
00:10:05,828 --> 00:10:07,677
Please untie me!

168
00:10:08,127 --> 00:10:10,088
You deserve it!

169
00:10:10,089 --> 00:10:12,305
- What happened?
- He's talking in casual tone to someone.

170
00:10:12,565 --> 00:10:14,809
Why have you had me tied up
all morning? Huh?

171
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:16,040
Please!

172
00:10:16,041 --> 00:10:18,864
- Please just untie me.
- No, Gary!

173
00:10:19,204 --> 00:10:21,880
Don't take my freedom away from me.

174
00:10:21,993 --> 00:10:23,370
Please!

175
00:10:23,371 --> 00:10:24,627
What is this?

176
00:10:25,473 --> 00:10:27,125
He's been kidnapped.

177
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:29,611
[Gary's been kidnapped!]

178
00:10:29,612 --> 00:10:32,157
- We're all coupled off anyways.
- We can film without him today.

179
00:10:33,179 --> 00:10:36,469
- What do you mean, film without him?
- Gary's been kidnapped anyway.

180
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:38,144
We have to go rescue him.

181
00:10:38,145 --> 00:10:39,888
Why do we need to rescue him?
We can just make a report to the police.

182
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:43,258
Just call 119.
Why bother going to rescue him ourselves?

183
00:10:43,259 --> 00:10:48,089
- Don't you have any loyalty?
- Calling 119 is the best thing to do.

184
00:10:49,097 --> 00:10:52,057
[Ah...]

185
00:10:52,058 --> 00:10:55,743
[Gary's phone...]

186
00:10:55,744 --> 00:10:57,340
Let me see that.
Has he received any weird texts?

187
00:10:57,341 --> 00:10:59,732
Check his phone call logs.

188
00:11:00,619 --> 00:11:02,134
Nobody move.

189
00:11:02,268 --> 00:11:04,706
- The criminal could be amongst us.
- You're the one who should stop moving.

190
00:11:08,576 --> 00:11:09,983
Who has he been talking to the most?

191
00:11:09,984 --> 00:11:15,894
[Start investigating the numbers which
show up most frequently on his call logs.]

192
00:11:15,895 --> 00:11:17,515
It's Ji Hyo.

193
00:11:17,516 --> 00:11:20,980
[The owner of that number is,
his Monday girlfriend, Ji Hyo.]

194
00:11:20,981 --> 00:11:22,347
- It's you.
- Yes, it's me.

195
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:24,167
- You're the culprit?
- No.

196
00:11:28,098 --> 00:11:30,563
[Oh?]

197
00:11:33,505 --> 00:11:37,265
[There's a suspicious looking number?]

198
00:11:37,266 --> 00:11:41,308
[Immediately tries calling that number.]

199
00:11:41,309 --> 00:11:43,178
- It's none of our phones.
- Hello?

200
00:11:44,072 --> 00:11:45,707
- Hello?
- Hello?

201
00:11:45,708 --> 00:11:46,977
It's a familiar voice.

202
00:11:46,978 --> 00:11:48,815
Hello?
Who is this?

203
00:11:48,816 --> 00:11:50,475
[A familiar male voice.]

204
00:11:50,476 --> 00:11:53,647
Kang Gary's been kidnapped.
Who is this?

205
00:11:53,648 --> 00:11:56,002
- Mister!
- There's a call history made to this number.

206
00:11:56,145 --> 00:11:57,362
<i>Mister?</i>

207
00:11:57,363 --> 00:12:00,345
- What is this? His voice is...
- Is it Gil?

208
00:12:00,346 --> 00:12:01,913
- Is it Gil?
- Did you just call me, 'Mister'?

209
00:12:01,914 --> 00:12:03,472
Gil, is it you?

210
00:12:05,286 --> 00:12:07,854
- Hi, Jae Suk.
- It is Gil!

211
00:12:08,719 --> 00:12:10,890
[The man behind the voice is,
Gil, from Leessang!]

212
00:12:10,891 --> 00:12:14,125
<i>The way you guys are speaking to me
right now is a bit rude.</i>

213
00:12:15,382 --> 00:12:17,760
- What did you say?
- How are we being rude?

214
00:12:17,761 --> 00:12:19,595
- It's because we're...
- Why are you all talking to me like that?

215
00:12:19,596 --> 00:12:22,652
It's because we're all flustered too.
We didn't expect you to answer the phone.

216
00:12:22,653 --> 00:12:24,485
Where's Gary, Gil?

217
00:12:24,486 --> 00:12:27,307
- I'm not sure where he is myself.
- This is Gil's real personal number.

218
00:12:27,308 --> 00:12:30,203
- Is this really your number?
- This is his real number.

219
00:12:30,204 --> 00:12:32,513
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry, Gil!

220
00:12:32,514 --> 00:12:34,671
You really are just answering your phone
instead coming out on our show today?

221
00:12:34,672 --> 00:12:37,952
[Did they just call Gil
on his personal cell number?]

222
00:12:38,846 --> 00:12:41,159
- Yeah.
- Should we go pay Gil a visit?

223
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,785
Gil, where are you right now?

224
00:12:43,483 --> 00:12:45,950
- Hello? Who is this?
- Hi, Gil. This is Kwang Soo.

225
00:12:46,214 --> 00:12:48,779
<i>Stay out of this, Kwang Soo!</i>

226
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:50,977
<i>Stay out of this, Kwang Soo!</i>

227
00:12:52,547 --> 00:12:55,816
- Sorry, Gil. We'll talk to you later.
- Wait, we should go see him.

228
00:12:55,817 --> 00:12:57,981
There's no reason for Gary to have called
Gil from his mission cell phone.

229
00:12:57,982 --> 00:13:01,169
[It's suspicious to see Gil's number
on this phone's phone record...]

230
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:02,877
Gil was the last person
he talked to on the phone.

231
00:13:02,878 --> 00:13:04,907
What did you and Gary talk about
this morning on the phone?

232
00:13:04,908 --> 00:13:06,825
- Who is this?
- This is Jae Suk.

233
00:13:06,826 --> 00:13:09,285
<i>Yes, Jae Suk.
I respect you and love you very much.</i>

234
00:13:09,286 --> 00:13:10,637
Where are you?

235
00:13:10,638 --> 00:13:14,567
<i>Right now, I'm...
I'm over in my neighborhood.</i>

236
00:13:14,568 --> 00:13:17,991
- You're in your neighborhood?
- Then let's go over to his neighborhood.

237
00:13:17,992 --> 00:13:20,979
[Off to Gil's neighborhood!]

238
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:23,597
<i>Please don't bring any awkward people.</i>

239
00:13:23,598 --> 00:13:24,985
Okay, who do you want me
to leave out?

240
00:13:25,416 --> 00:13:30,243
<i>At least... Jong Kook and Kwang Soo.</i>

241
00:13:30,244 --> 00:13:32,368
Why me?
Why do you not want me there?

242
00:13:32,369 --> 00:13:33,922
You don't want them to come?

243
00:13:33,923 --> 00:13:35,465
<i>You know me, don't you?
You know my personality.</i>

244
00:13:35,466 --> 00:13:38,542
- If I even see their faces nearby...
- Okay, I got it.

245
00:13:38,543 --> 00:13:40,766
- Okay, I got it.
- Don't worry, I got it.

246
00:13:40,767 --> 00:13:42,777
[Gil is more sensitive than he may look?]

247
00:13:42,778 --> 00:13:43,902
- Okay, we'll see you soon.
- Sorry, Gil!

248
00:13:43,903 --> 00:13:46,744
- Okay, see you.
- See you soon, Hallyu star.

249
00:13:46,745 --> 00:13:48,696
That's the way he needs to be treated.

250
00:13:48,697 --> 00:13:52,465
Gil has been acting as Gary's
assistant of some sorts lately.

251
00:13:53,482 --> 00:13:56,452
- They've been doing fan meetings in Asia.
- Gary's been doing fan meetings.

252
00:13:56,453 --> 00:13:58,908
Even though they're doing
the meetings as Leessang

253
00:13:58,909 --> 00:14:01,247
but Gary's been getting more attention,
and Gil could be getting jealous.

254
00:14:01,248 --> 00:14:02,996
- So he could've been the one to kidnap him.
- Then maybe he's the culprit?

255
00:14:02,996 --> 00:14:06,215
<i>As you may have guessed, your mission
today is to find and rescue Gary.</i>

256
00:14:06,503 --> 00:14:09,161
<i>We're not going to be
giving you a single hint.</i>

257
00:14:09,162 --> 00:14:11,081
<i>You have to figure things out
for yourselves.</i>

258
00:14:11,081 --> 00:14:15,013
<i>You must rescue Gary before
the time runs out.</i>

259
00:14:15,014 --> 00:14:19,055
<i>The team that steps onto the platform we've
prepared with Gary, wins today's race.</i>

260
00:14:19,895 --> 00:14:23,996
<i>[Gary's kidnapping case.]</i>

261
00:14:24,292 --> 00:14:26,368
If we don't rescue Gary today,
then he'll leave the show.

262
00:14:26,369 --> 00:14:28,749
Yeah, and we can't have him
leaving the show ever again.

263
00:14:30,045 --> 00:14:33,652
[Must hurry to rescue their flight risk icon.]

264
00:14:34,643 --> 00:14:36,060
- Hello.
- Hello.

265
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:39,143
Can you take us to Seol-Rae village?

266
00:14:39,144 --> 00:14:41,146
[Everyone is heading off to Seol-Rae
where Gil is there waiting for them.]

267
00:14:41,632 --> 00:14:43,846
Let's hurry and follow
the car in front of us.

268
00:14:44,738 --> 00:14:46,152
Hello.

269
00:14:46,306 --> 00:14:50,723
[Mission to rescue Gary-
A battle amongst the three teams.]

270
00:14:51,978 --> 00:14:56,725
[The last person Gary spoke to, Gil,
is their only clue so far to his whereabouts.]

271
00:14:56,726 --> 00:14:59,837
Hello, Gil.
This is Ji Hyo.

272
00:14:59,838 --> 00:15:02,466
- Hey, Sis-in-law!
- Yes, hello.

273
00:15:03,284 --> 00:15:05,019
- Hi.
- It's been way too long.

274
00:15:05,214 --> 00:15:07,621
- I haven't seen you since the concert.
- Gil is a softie when it comes to women.

275
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:09,429
- Have you been well?
- Yes, I have.

276
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:12,616
I'm actually on my way to see you right now,
and wanted to know where I need to go.

277
00:15:12,617 --> 00:15:14,440
I enjoyed the ad the two of you
shot a while ago.

278
00:15:15,222 --> 00:15:18,714
- Who's sitting next to you right now?
- My PD is sitting next to me right now.

279
00:15:20,535 --> 00:15:22,330
- Are you the one who kidnapped him?
- Be quiet!

280
00:15:22,812 --> 00:15:26,143
[Kwang Soo is a secret
that Blank Ji wants to keep hidden.]

281
00:15:26,144 --> 00:15:28,853
- Yes, we're shooting Running Man right now.
- He must not be our guest for the day...

282
00:15:29,218 --> 00:15:32,607
<i>What's going on?
I'm at the cafe that I was told to go to.</i>

283
00:15:32,608 --> 00:15:35,248
Are you at a cafe right now?
Is it the cafe by your house?

284
00:15:35,249 --> 00:15:37,866
The cafe right by my house.

285
00:15:37,867 --> 00:15:41,685
In your neighborhood?
I... don't know where you live.

286
00:15:41,686 --> 00:15:43,854
I know where he lives.
I once had to give him a ride home.

287
00:15:44,364 --> 00:15:46,617
<i>I know that's Kwang Soo's
voice next to you.</i>

288
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:52,306
- No, PD Myuk is sitting next to me.
- Do I really have to lie about my existence?

289
00:15:52,781 --> 00:15:55,922
- What wrong have I ever done?
- I'll come to the cafe right now.

290
00:15:55,923 --> 00:15:57,948
I haven't done anything wrong to Gil.

291
00:15:58,055 --> 00:16:01,546
- Hey! I told you not to say anything!
- Do I have to lie about me being here?

292
00:16:01,547 --> 00:16:04,418
Gil didn't want you to come.
Did you not hear him saying that earlier?

293
00:16:04,455 --> 00:16:07,433
You're like a blend of Jong Kook,
and Jae Suk put together.

294
00:16:09,509 --> 00:16:11,215
[Kwang Soo is calling Gil with a number
that Gil wouldn't recognize.]

295
00:16:11,216 --> 00:16:12,408
Hello?

296
00:16:12,409 --> 00:16:14,951
- Hello?
- This is PD Kim Chul Woo from Running Man.

297
00:16:17,605 --> 00:16:19,209
<i>I know it's you, Jong Kook.</i>

298
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:20,488
Hello?

299
00:16:21,612 --> 00:16:24,842
[Gil is mistaking Kwang Soo's voice
to be that of Jong Kook's!]

300
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:28,593
<i>Do you actually think that
I wouldn't recognize your voice?</i>

301
00:16:31,818 --> 00:16:34,408
He must be stupid.
I think he really must be stupid.

302
00:16:35,355 --> 00:16:36,977
Hey, Baldy.
(Trying to impersonate Kkuk?)

303
00:16:37,597 --> 00:16:40,038
[Going all out on his 'Kkuk' impersonation.]

304
00:16:40,039 --> 00:16:41,477
Where are you?

305
00:16:43,148 --> 00:16:46,425
<i>I really don't know what's going on
right now, Jong Kook.</i>

306
00:16:46,426 --> 00:16:48,384
You're dead when I see you.

307
00:16:49,182 --> 00:16:53,177
[Gil wholeheartedly believes
Kwang Soo to be Kkuk right now.]

308
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:56,074
<i>I really have no idea right now,
but I'm out here after receiving Gary's call.</i>

309
00:16:56,075 --> 00:16:58,465
Just tell me where you're at right now.

310
00:16:58,692 --> 00:17:02,438
[Feeling the confidence that comes with
Kkuk's name, and acting foolishly brave.]

311
00:17:02,439 --> 00:17:06,152
I'm warning you right now not to tell anyone
where you're at even if it's me calling back.

312
00:17:06,153 --> 00:17:07,452
<i>What?</i>

313
00:17:07,487 --> 00:17:10,072
Even if I happen to ask you again later,
don't tell me where you're at.

314
00:17:10,073 --> 00:17:13,077
[Trying to think of ways to stop Kkuk
from finding out where Gil is.]

315
00:17:13,078 --> 00:17:15,744
- Aren't you filming right now?
- I am filming right now.

316
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:19,714
Even if I were to call you again asking you to
tell me where you're at, don't tell me.

317
00:17:19,715 --> 00:17:22,396
[Making a nonsensical request to Gil.]

318
00:17:22,397 --> 00:17:23,728
- Okay, Jong Kook.
- Okay.

319
00:17:23,729 --> 00:17:25,323
<i>Bye, Jong Kook.</i>

320
00:17:26,521 --> 00:17:28,446
I didn't know I was such a good
impersonator of Jong Kook.

321
00:17:29,714 --> 00:17:32,369
How could he think that
my voice was Jong Kook's?

322
00:17:33,515 --> 00:17:36,217
- How could he think that?
- My beloved Gil...

323
00:17:37,719 --> 00:17:39,954
My beloved Gil.
Where are you, my beloved Gil?

324
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:42,644
Our team has the best chance of
winning right now, Gil.

325
00:17:42,645 --> 00:17:44,585
Where are you, my beloved Gil?

326
00:17:44,586 --> 00:17:46,806
<i>Isn't this PD Kim Chul Woo?</i>

327
00:17:47,382 --> 00:17:50,902
[Gil really seems to have fallen for
Giraffe's trickery.]

328
00:17:51,428 --> 00:17:54,021
- Where are you, Gil?
- There's Jae Suk over there.

329
00:17:54,642 --> 00:17:58,806
- I really miss you, Gil. Where are you?
- We need to follow Jae Suk.

330
00:17:59,193 --> 00:18:02,251
Come on, Gil. Today's
not your last day on this earth.

331
00:18:02,252 --> 00:18:04,233
Don't do that, Jong Kook.
Don't go around threatening him.

332
00:18:04,234 --> 00:18:06,493
- I wasn't threatening him.
- Why are you speaking to him like that?

333
00:18:06,494 --> 00:18:09,843
No, that's not what he meant..
He wasn't threatening you at all.

334
00:18:09,844 --> 00:18:11,748
- Apologize for the way you spoke to him.
- I'm sorry.

335
00:18:11,749 --> 00:18:14,027
You can't talk to him like that.
He's very sensitive.

336
00:18:14,028 --> 00:18:15,911
- That's not what I meant to do.
- You were threatening him.

337
00:18:15,912 --> 00:18:19,481
- I want to apologize. I'm sorry.
- Tell him that's not what you meant.

338
00:18:19,482 --> 00:18:20,955
Sorry, Gil.
I want to apologize.

339
00:18:20,956 --> 00:18:23,162
That's not what I meant.
I'm telling you I didn't mean it like that.

340
00:18:23,163 --> 00:18:25,628
- I just meant that we're filming now.
- Just accept Jong Kook's apology.

341
00:18:25,629 --> 00:18:28,517
What I meant by that was,
I want to keep seeing you after today.

342
00:18:28,518 --> 00:18:30,608
It's not like we're going to stop
being friends or anything.

343
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:32,253
- Ha Ha.
- Yes, Gil?

344
00:18:32,254 --> 00:18:37,021
<i>Bring PD Kim Chul Woo,
and come to Bang-Bae Middle School.</i>

345
00:18:37,022 --> 00:18:39,751
Bang-Bae Middle School?
That's where we are right now.

346
00:18:39,752 --> 00:18:42,985
<i>Come towards Jae Dong's house
which is right in front of that school.</i>

347
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:45,297
Really?
To Jae Dong's house?

348
00:18:45,298 --> 00:18:46,542
<i> Yeah, come towards his house.</i>

349
00:18:46,543 --> 00:18:48,588
But Jae Dong's house is
really far away from here.

350
00:18:50,019 --> 00:18:52,961
[Gil is at a cafe that is about halfway
between the school and Jae Dong's house.]

351
00:18:53,582 --> 00:18:56,073
Jae Dong's house is
a really far walk from here.

352
00:18:59,597 --> 00:19:01,170
Wait, over there!

353
00:19:02,815 --> 00:19:04,302
[Oh?]

354
00:19:04,303 --> 00:19:06,832
[That round head is...]

355
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:08,938
Over there!
He's over there!

356
00:19:10,387 --> 00:19:13,739
[It's Gil!]

357
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:16,986
[Finding Gil by pure coincidence
on their walk over to Jae Dong's house.]

358
00:19:16,987 --> 00:19:18,856
- What are you wearing right now?
- I thought you were Jae Dong.

359
00:19:18,857 --> 00:19:20,940
[Gil is dressed in what seems to be
his most comfortable outfit.]

360
00:19:20,941 --> 00:19:23,391
[Extra glad to see him from having
run into him by such sheer luck.]

361
00:19:23,392 --> 00:19:25,680
- What took you so long?
- Why didn't you come on sooner?

362
00:19:25,681 --> 00:19:29,330
- I don't even know what's going on right now.
- What's going on here?

363
00:19:29,331 --> 00:19:31,251
Let's just go in and talk.

364
00:19:31,252 --> 00:19:34,344
[Agreeing to get out of the rain,
and head inside to talk.]

365
00:19:34,345 --> 00:19:36,564
- Have you seen Jae Suk?
- No, I haven't.

366
00:19:37,228 --> 00:19:43,507
[Could Gil give them any clues to solve
the mystery behind Gary's kidnapping?]

367
00:19:44,986 --> 00:19:47,447
Did you not see any cameras
around here?

368
00:19:48,504 --> 00:19:52,539
[There are no cameras surrounding Gil,
and he's not even wearing a mic.]

369
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:54,745
- You really are here alone?
- I told you that I've got nothing.

370
00:19:54,746 --> 00:19:56,646
I just came out here after
receiving Gary's call.

371
00:19:56,647 --> 00:19:58,152
Seriously?

372
00:19:58,932 --> 00:20:01,341
But doesn't this look like the perfect place
to keep someone locked and hidden away?

373
00:20:01,342 --> 00:20:02,888
Maybe he's in the basement or something.

374
00:20:02,889 --> 00:20:07,142
[Could kidnapped Gary be hidden away
somewhere in this place?]

375
00:20:08,336 --> 00:20:10,284
- You got a call from Gary?
- And he told you to come here?

376
00:20:10,285 --> 00:20:12,076
- Yeah.
- He called you?

377
00:20:12,518 --> 00:20:14,688
Gary called me earlier this morning.

378
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:18,032
He called me and told me
to come and meet him here.

379
00:20:18,033 --> 00:20:22,301
[Gil tells them that he's just as confused as
they are about what's going on.]

380
00:20:22,302 --> 00:20:25,519
- So what happened?
- Wait, do you really eat like this?

381
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,571
- Yes, Jong Kook.
- Then why does your body look like that?

382
00:20:27,572 --> 00:20:29,568
- What are you saying?
- His body is just fine right now.

383
00:20:29,569 --> 00:20:31,626
His body is just fine right now.

384
00:20:31,627 --> 00:20:35,558
[How many times do you need to be told?
He's a very sensitive man!]

385
00:20:36,878 --> 00:20:39,979
- Then do I actually have something?
- We'll figure this out.

386
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:45,180
- Jae Suk, Gary's been kidnapped.
- Why would Gary be kidnapped?

387
00:20:45,181 --> 00:20:47,422
I don't know either.
I don't know why he's been kidnapped.

388
00:20:47,423 --> 00:20:49,556
Gary's been kidnapped, and to be honest,
we thought you had something to do with it.

389
00:20:49,557 --> 00:20:53,418
We thought that you kidnapped Gary
because you were jealous of him.

390
00:20:54,888 --> 00:20:58,868
Why would you even think that?
I'm Gary's carrier.

391
00:20:58,869 --> 00:21:00,829
- That's what Jae Suk said.
- Jae Suk said that?

392
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:06,035
We found Gary's phone after he was kidnapped,
and when we searched through that phone

393
00:21:06,036 --> 00:21:07,232
we found your number in
the call log.

394
00:21:07,233 --> 00:21:10,908
- You were the person he called.
- What did Gary say to you?

395
00:21:10,909 --> 00:21:12,830
- He asked if I heard.
- So I asked him what he was talking about.

396
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:16,629
That's when Gary just asked me to
come meet him here.

397
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:20,048
- So he told you to come here?
- Yeah, so I came here, and no one was here.

398
00:21:20,049 --> 00:21:24,497
- There weren't even any cameras here.
- Then he must've been kidnapped on his way.

399
00:21:24,498 --> 00:21:26,546
He must've been kidnapped on his way
here to meet you.

400
00:21:28,666 --> 00:21:32,580
- We're going to put a mic on Gil.
- You're giving me one after all this time?

401
00:21:33,779 --> 00:21:35,995
I was wondering what I was doing here.

402
00:21:35,996 --> 00:21:39,039
He seriously didn't have any cameras
or any mics on him?

403
00:21:39,905 --> 00:21:45,150
- You must've been so lonely.
- I've had a ton of unknown calls.

404
00:21:45,518 --> 00:21:48,639
I seriously have no idea
what's going on right now.

405
00:21:49,469 --> 00:21:50,874
Here it is.

406
00:21:51,526 --> 00:21:54,008
[The Yellow Team followed the
Blue Team here.]

407
00:21:54,009 --> 00:21:55,997
There they come.

408
00:21:55,998 --> 00:21:59,238
[Everyone gathers together where Gil is.]

409
00:22:00,897 --> 00:22:03,059
- Hello, Gil.
- Where's Gary?

410
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:07,466
- Hi, Gil.
- Gil has no idea what's going on right now.

411
00:22:07,467 --> 00:22:09,478
- Hello.
- You really don't know what's going on?

412
00:22:10,787 --> 00:22:13,899
[Everyone's shocked at how overly
casually dressed Gil is at the moment.]

413
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:16,407
- They just put this mic on me.
- They really did just put it on him.

414
00:22:16,408 --> 00:22:18,375
I went to the cafe,
and there was no one there.

415
00:22:18,742 --> 00:22:20,344
- There was no one there.
- He's telling the truth.

416
00:22:20,345 --> 00:22:22,972
- There wasn't even single camera there.
- There was no one when we saw him.

417
00:22:22,973 --> 00:22:26,533
- No cameras when you guys arrived?
- We searched all over that place.

418
00:22:26,534 --> 00:22:28,993
- There was nothing there.
- Seriously?

419
00:22:28,994 --> 00:22:30,987
- What does that mean?
- But... what am I doing here?

420
00:22:31,316 --> 00:22:33,272
That's what we'd like to ask.
What are you doing here?

421
00:22:33,273 --> 00:22:35,358
- I don't know why I'm here.
- Give us a clue.

422
00:22:35,359 --> 00:22:37,967
- Are you a guest on our episode?
- He doesn't have any clues.

423
00:22:37,968 --> 00:22:40,130
Gil really doesn't know anything?

424
00:22:40,131 --> 00:22:42,327
[Gil really doesn't know anything?]

425
00:22:42,328 --> 00:22:45,363
- What are you doing?
- Checking to see if you're hiding anything.

426
00:22:47,417 --> 00:22:50,026
So this is how you guys film this show?

427
00:22:51,395 --> 00:22:54,687
- What is all this?
- There has to be something on Gil.

428
00:22:54,688 --> 00:22:56,663
There must be something here for us to
have been directed towards him.

429
00:22:56,664 --> 00:22:59,569
There must be something here in the cafe
since this is where Gary said to meet.

430
00:22:59,570 --> 00:23:03,160
- Why do you keep trying to strip me?
- Gil really must not know anything.

431
00:23:03,828 --> 00:23:07,301
- What is it? What do you know?
- I'm going to lose my mind here.

432
00:23:07,302 --> 00:23:08,895
- You really don't know anything?
- No, I don't!

433
00:23:08,896 --> 00:23:12,219
- Do you know where Gary went?
- I don't want you talking to me.

434
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:15,128
When you tried to abandon me
by the riverside expressway...

435
00:23:15,129 --> 00:23:17,670
[Huh? What's he talking about?]

436
00:23:17,671 --> 00:23:19,864
We went to hangout after some dinner outing
that Running Man had.

437
00:23:19,865 --> 00:23:22,210
So I asked Kwang Soo to give me a ride back
to my house since it was on his way.

438
00:23:22,211 --> 00:23:23,690
He didn't take you home?

439
00:23:23,691 --> 00:23:26,474
- You know how he is though.
- How?

440
00:23:26,475 --> 00:23:28,681
He told me that he'll take a right
at Donjak Bridge

441
00:23:28,682 --> 00:23:30,970
and that I should get out at the bridge
and walk the rest of the way home.

442
00:23:30,971 --> 00:23:34,165
- That's not what I meant.
- How could he have said that?

443
00:23:34,166 --> 00:23:37,675
- So I want you to stay away from me.
- How could you have said that to him?

444
00:23:37,676 --> 00:23:40,093
- Why were you trying to abandon him?
- I wasn't trying to abandon him.

445
00:23:40,094 --> 00:23:42,165
I want you to go wait outside.

446
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:47,106
- You can't take him anywhere.
- Go wait outside.

447
00:23:47,107 --> 00:23:49,995
[Giraffe has been kicked out from the group.]

448
00:23:49,996 --> 00:23:53,442
- You know that wasn't right.
- He never should've said that to you.

449
00:23:53,937 --> 00:23:55,496
How much is this?

450
00:23:55,497 --> 00:23:56,887
How much is this?

451
00:23:56,888 --> 00:23:59,498
[Huh?]

452
00:23:59,499 --> 00:24:02,396
- Go away and stay away from him.
- What is that?

453
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:07,248
[You're not... really thinking...]

454
00:24:08,770 --> 00:24:15,363
[A pink headband... that's suitable for Gil?]

455
00:24:16,919 --> 00:24:19,506
[And Jae Suk actually
puts that on Gil's head?]

456
00:24:20,354 --> 00:24:23,312
[The bald man with the pink headband on his
head is getting fired up from the shame.]

457
00:24:25,877 --> 00:24:29,669
- Please get out of here, Mister.
- That's my gift to your future wife.

458
00:24:31,042 --> 00:24:33,791
[The baldheaded headband?]

459
00:24:35,079 --> 00:24:36,587
- This really isn't right.
- That's wrong.

460
00:24:36,588 --> 00:24:40,180
[I told you that I'm a sensitive man!]

461
00:24:41,168 --> 00:24:43,883
Sit down. Let's let Gil sit down.
He's having a really tough time right now.

462
00:24:43,884 --> 00:24:46,636
Get away from me, Kwang Soo!

463
00:24:47,697 --> 00:24:49,608
Here's some water with lemon.

464
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:55,913
[Everyone's trying to grab Gil's attention
since he may have the only clue.]

465
00:24:55,914 --> 00:24:58,014
- Do we have to play a game or something?
- What game?

466
00:24:58,015 --> 00:25:01,366
[Feeling like he has to do something
now that he's on the show?]

467
00:25:02,218 --> 00:25:04,575
- Don't feel like you need to do something.
- You just need to be.

468
00:25:04,576 --> 00:25:06,938
Anyone who wants to get out of
here can leave.

469
00:25:06,939 --> 00:25:08,127
[Just then]

470
00:25:08,128 --> 00:25:11,072
[A delivery?]

471
00:25:11,073 --> 00:25:12,600
I have a delivery for Mr. Gil Sung Joon.

472
00:25:16,711 --> 00:25:19,732
- This must be it.
- Then he really didn't know anything.

473
00:25:20,749 --> 00:25:22,587
- Why don't you open it?
- He really didn't lie to us.

474
00:25:22,588 --> 00:25:24,212
- He wasn't lying.
- I'll open it.

475
00:25:24,213 --> 00:25:29,719
[Gary asked Gil to meet up with him...
but receives a mysterious package instead.]

476
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:32,631
You can't get all immature on me,
and try to take this away from me, okay?

477
00:25:33,469 --> 00:25:37,230
- We don't like doing things like that.
- Don't try to intercept me or anything.

478
00:25:37,231 --> 00:25:39,113
What's 'intercept'?

479
00:25:39,114 --> 00:25:41,678
- Seriously?
- You're trying to be too original.

480
00:25:44,206 --> 00:25:47,926
- Wait... hang on.
- Okay, you go take a look on your own first.

481
00:25:47,927 --> 00:25:50,424
Why don't you open the box over there?

482
00:25:50,425 --> 00:25:53,670
- I'm just trying to take a peek.
- Leave him alone to open the box.

483
00:25:54,964 --> 00:25:58,774
[Just what did he find inside the box?]

484
00:25:58,775 --> 00:26:00,745
- What is it?
- What's in there?

485
00:26:00,746 --> 00:26:04,969
[A clue behind Gary's kidnapping?]

486
00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:07,834
[There's not just one?]

487
00:26:07,835 --> 00:26:09,621
- Where did the delivery come from?
- You don't need to know.

488
00:26:09,622 --> 00:26:12,276
- Don't even ask him anything.
- Stop talking to him!

489
00:26:12,277 --> 00:26:14,775
- He told you to leave him alone.
- Just go home!

490
00:26:14,776 --> 00:26:17,201
- Don't you think you're being too harsh?
- Just go home.

491
00:26:17,202 --> 00:26:19,185
I'll call you later, so just go home.

492
00:26:19,186 --> 00:26:22,546
[Yeah... why don't you go and
get some rest?]

493
00:26:23,499 --> 00:26:25,983
- What's in there?
- This is exactly what I thought it'd be.

494
00:26:25,984 --> 00:26:27,872
- What's in there?
- Let me switch spots first.

495
00:26:27,873 --> 00:26:29,977
Let the Blue Team come up here.

496
00:26:29,978 --> 00:26:32,961
- Switch spots with us.
- The moment you see this...

497
00:26:32,962 --> 00:26:35,327
you're going to run out of here.

498
00:26:35,328 --> 00:26:37,747
- I guarantee.
- You must be quite athletic.

499
00:26:39,358 --> 00:26:44,009
[Blue Team to the back and Yellow Team to
the front due to Big-nose's comment.]

500
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:46,946
- Why would you say that?
- He just made fun of me.

501
00:26:47,848 --> 00:26:52,253
[Whatever Gil says goes!
He's the one with the only clue.]

502
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:56,080
This is really...
I know exactly what this means.

503
00:26:56,081 --> 00:26:58,236
- So what I mean is...
- So it's a clue to the next location?

504
00:26:58,789 --> 00:27:01,125
What's with this guy?

505
00:27:01,345 --> 00:27:04,855
- What did I say?
- Go, get away.

506
00:27:06,111 --> 00:27:10,046
[Back to their original spot
in less than ten seconds.]

507
00:27:10,047 --> 00:27:12,324
Can I share what I know with them
however I want?

508
00:27:12,325 --> 00:27:13,531
- Sure!
- Seriously?

509
00:27:13,532 --> 00:27:16,606
Then I'll just give all of you
a piece of the clue.

510
00:27:17,658 --> 00:27:19,779
Let's all see it together.

511
00:27:20,837 --> 00:27:25,297
[A total of three clues inside the box.]

512
00:27:26,151 --> 00:27:31,633
[Just what do these clues mean?]

513
00:27:31,634 --> 00:27:34,582
[A wedding photo, video tape,
and A-Pink's album.]

514
00:27:34,583 --> 00:27:37,135
- Let's go.
- Thanks for your help, Gil. Let's go.

515
00:27:40,356 --> 00:27:43,358
[Completely different treatment
the moment they got their clues.]

516
00:27:45,063 --> 00:27:48,024
- Are you all really abandoning me like this?
- That's what usually happens.

517
00:27:48,335 --> 00:27:50,367
Thanks for your help, Gil.

518
00:27:50,368 --> 00:27:51,859
Let's look at it together.

519
00:27:53,933 --> 00:27:57,057
[They're all taking a close look at
the videotape that was delivered to Gil.]

520
00:27:59,305 --> 00:28:02,832
[It's Gary!]

521
00:28:02,833 --> 00:28:05,548
[It's the scene of his kidnapping!]

522
00:28:05,549 --> 00:28:07,265
<i>What are you guys doing?</i>

523
00:28:08,872 --> 00:28:11,005
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

524
00:28:11,006 --> 00:28:13,289
[Someone's in the car?]

525
00:28:13,290 --> 00:28:16,301
- That's an A-Pink song!
- Ah! A-Pink!

526
00:28:17,521 --> 00:28:21,100
- This is A-Pink's album.
- I think that car was A-Pink's car.

527
00:28:21,101 --> 00:28:23,400
[A-Pink's album that was delivered,
and their song that was played...]

528
00:28:23,401 --> 00:28:26,721
Seeing this picture means that Gary's
somehow close to these people, right?

529
00:28:26,722 --> 00:28:29,580
[A picture of Leessang, Dynamic Duo,
Jung Chi, and Jung In?]

530
00:28:29,581 --> 00:28:31,633
I'm sorry to say this, but can
you leave since this is Running Man?

531
00:28:32,583 --> 00:28:37,558
Jae Suk... remember how Gary was
teamed up with A-Pink the last time?

532
00:28:37,559 --> 00:28:39,468
Wait!
I just got a text.

533
00:28:39,469 --> 00:28:41,675
- What does it say?
- That the culprit is inside the delivery box.

534
00:28:41,676 --> 00:28:44,924
<i>[The culprit is inside the delivery box.]</i>

535
00:28:46,065 --> 00:28:48,425
The culprit must be one of the five
in the picture.

536
00:28:48,426 --> 00:28:51,069
- Then it must be one of these people.
- Then couldn't Gil be the culprit?

537
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:54,147
- Gil's not the culprit.
- You can leave if you're not the culprit.

538
00:28:57,395 --> 00:28:59,184
Can't I stay since I'm already
on the show?

539
00:28:59,185 --> 00:29:01,662
- This is a picture.
- What else is in there?

540
00:29:02,425 --> 00:29:07,912
[If they put all the clues together...]

541
00:29:07,913 --> 00:29:10,651
Stop hanging around and just leave.

542
00:29:10,652 --> 00:29:13,835
- Stop being like this.
- This is Sunday now.

543
00:29:14,530 --> 00:29:19,342
- I'll see you on Saturday.
- I saw a picture in there.

544
00:29:19,343 --> 00:29:21,174
I told you that I'll see you on Saturday.

545
00:29:22,322 --> 00:29:24,831
- You really are being too harsh.
- Let me work with my Sunday buddies.

546
00:29:24,832 --> 00:29:28,639
I'm close to all these guys too!
All these guys and I are really close!

547
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:31,762
But we're in the middle of filming
our show right now.

548
00:29:31,763 --> 00:29:34,443
You're putting me in a tough spot right now,
so quit it, and just leave.

549
00:29:34,847 --> 00:29:39,200
[Today is Sunday-
Saturday work buddy is forced out.]

550
00:29:39,333 --> 00:29:42,303
- Where are you going to go?
- I'm going home and taking a shower.

551
00:29:43,177 --> 00:29:45,214
I guess this is it.

552
00:29:45,215 --> 00:29:48,149
[Gains their first hint from Gil,
dressed in his workout outfit!]

553
00:29:49,655 --> 00:29:53,523
[The culprit is in this photo?]

554
00:29:54,861 --> 00:29:58,898
[Kwang Soo is quietly searching through
the numbers off in the corner.]

555
00:29:58,899 --> 00:30:02,737
[Gary knows Eun Ji's number
from A-Pink!]

556
00:30:04,894 --> 00:30:08,354
A-Pink's album was in the box.
Should we give Eun Ji a call?

557
00:30:08,355 --> 00:30:12,314
[Could Eun Ji know anything?]

558
00:30:12,743 --> 00:30:14,709
- Hello?
- Hi, Eun Ji.

559
00:30:15,658 --> 00:30:18,171
- Who is this?
- It's Kwang Soo.

560
00:30:18,172 --> 00:30:20,528
<i>Hi, Kwang Soo!
This isn't your number.</i>

561
00:30:20,529 --> 00:30:23,168
I'm calling you from a different phone.

562
00:30:23,616 --> 00:30:27,481
You're calling me from a different phone?
Anyways, why are you calling me?

563
00:30:27,482 --> 00:30:31,188
Why would you ask me why I'm calling?
Can't I just call to say hi?

564
00:30:32,186 --> 00:30:35,367
- I'm so happy to hear from you!
- Yeah, it's been awhile.

565
00:30:35,368 --> 00:30:38,519
- What are you doing?
- I'm at practice right now.

566
00:30:39,044 --> 00:30:42,373
- You're at practice?
- Yes, we're at the studio right now.

567
00:30:42,374 --> 00:30:47,895
I see... by any chance, is there
anything between you and Gary?

568
00:30:47,896 --> 00:30:50,497
- Do you, Eun Ji?
- Why are you being so blunt?

569
00:30:50,887 --> 00:30:53,587
<i>I did receive some sort of
a delivery today.</i>

570
00:30:53,588 --> 00:30:56,184
- Tell me where you're at.
- Where's your studio?

571
00:30:56,185 --> 00:30:58,125
Tell me where your practice studio is.

572
00:30:58,126 --> 00:31:03,541
- I'll send you the address.
- Send the address to this phone, okay?

573
00:31:03,542 --> 00:31:05,904
- Yes, I'll send it.
- Thanks.

574
00:31:08,502 --> 00:31:12,431
[Mission to rescue Gary-
Yellow Team is off to get their next clue!]

575
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:17,818
<i>So if the culprit is one of the people
in that picture...</i>

576
00:31:18,175 --> 00:31:23,554
- Since their song was playing...
- Maybe we'll get another clue to the culprit.

577
00:31:24,462 --> 00:31:26,881
<i>Just where in the world is Gary?</i>

578
00:31:27,001 --> 00:31:30,265
- I'm sure we'll find something there.
- I'm sure we will.

579
00:31:30,266 --> 00:31:31,362
[On their way to see the newlyweds,
and possible suspects, Jung Chi and Jung In.]

580
00:31:31,363 --> 00:31:33,285
- I'm sure something will work itself out.
- Of course.

581
00:31:33,286 --> 00:31:35,036
The future is shining brightly ahead of us.

582
00:31:37,038 --> 00:31:38,668
- Hello?
- Gaeko. ('Dog nose')

583
00:31:38,669 --> 00:31:41,735
Tell me what your address is,
or do you want to meet somewhere else?

584
00:31:41,736 --> 00:31:46,020
- How do we get to where you are?
- There's a snack shop and a bakery out front.

585
00:31:46,021 --> 00:31:47,698
A snack shop?

586
00:31:47,699 --> 00:31:50,128
- Go to the ddukbokki snack shop.
- Okay.

587
00:31:50,163 --> 00:31:54,634
- And make sure you get the curry ddukbokki.
- Okay, we got it.

588
00:31:54,635 --> 00:31:56,252
Isn't curry ddukbokki a little weird?

589

[In front of 'S' Elementary School
in Shinsadong.]

590

- Who is it?

Oh my goodness!

You're both here?

[The ultimate hip-hop duo:
Dynamic Duo- Choi Ja and Gaeko.]

596
00:32:32,124 --> 00:32:35,104
- It's really nice to see you guys.
- You guys have a gym right across the street.

597
00:32:35,105 --> 00:32:36,660
You guys should start working out.

[Workout fanatic trying to talk them into
starting to work out right away?]

599

There's nothing better than working out.

Just come workout with me.
It's the best stress reliever out there.

601

that's making them forget why they even came.]

606

Wow, this is so delicious.
Unbelievable.

I'll be honest and tell you
what's going on.

- The truth is, Gary's been kidnapped.
- Gary has?

611
00:33:20,742 --> 00:33:23,170
Yeah, we don't know who kidnapped him,
and why they would've done it.

612
00:33:23,171 --> 00:33:26,812
Gil received a delivery while
he was with us.

613
00:33:26,813 --> 00:33:29,928
And there was a picture inside that box.

614
00:33:29,929 --> 00:33:32,051
As a clue?

615
00:33:32,052 --> 00:33:35,577
In the picture was Leessang,
Jung Chi and Jung In.

[And these two men who were also
clearly in the picture.]

Gary?

619
00:33:43,118 --> 00:33:45,767
- Why would Gary be here?
- No, he's in here.

620

[Could Gary, who's been kidnapped be in here?]

621
00:33:49,030 --> 00:33:50,796
What is this door?

622
00:33:53,704 --> 00:33:55,858
I have the washer in there.

You'd be wiser to look elsewhere than
to waste your time here.

Look at how he keeps nervously trying
to send us away somewhere.

627

00:34:56,975 --> 00:35:00,328
- What are you guys doing here anyway?
- We needed to talk to you about something.

641
00:35:01,254 --> 00:35:05,566
Gil received a delivery while he was with us,
and there was a picture inside the box.

642
00:35:05,601 --> 00:35:11,858
There was a picture of you two, Gil, Gary,
and Dynamic Duo in there.

643
00:35:11,859 --> 00:35:16,558
[The clue stated that the culprit
is inside the box.]

644
00:35:16,559 --> 00:35:18,599
So you guys were also in the picture.

645
00:35:20,269 --> 00:35:24,182
[Big-nose Brother going into his
full on investigative mode.]

646
00:35:24,183 --> 00:35:26,146
- What color is your car?
- Our car?

647
00:35:26,147 --> 00:35:28,125
- Yes, we do have a car.
- What color is it?

648
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:31,317
- What color is the car?
- It's black, I think.

649
00:35:33,151 --> 00:35:34,669
- Are you the culprit?
- Tell us if you're the culprit.

650
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:37,270
- That's just absurd.
- Let's tell them we are and just end this.

651
00:35:38,342 --> 00:35:40,984
[His statement flusters the investigators.]

652
00:35:40,985 --> 00:35:43,410
I don't think this will do.
Get up out of your seat right now.

653
00:35:43,411 --> 00:35:46,448
- Why are you getting mad at me?
- I think that you need to be taken in.

654
00:35:46,449 --> 00:35:49,985
[Two middle aged cops
pulling out their tough guy act.]

655
00:35:49,986 --> 00:35:52,630
- You guys need to come with me.
- Do you see how Jae Suk is getting violent?

656
00:35:54,603 --> 00:35:56,833
Do you have anything in your pockets?

657
00:35:56,834 --> 00:35:59,167
You leave me no choice but to
make you guys take the lie detector test.

658
00:35:59,168 --> 00:36:00,999
- You have a lie detector test?
- Yeah.

659
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,400
Isn't that a basic prop
for any investigator to have?

660
00:36:03,401 --> 00:36:06,300
- You guys think we wouldn't have one?
- If this is the way you want to do it...

661
00:36:06,301 --> 00:36:08,663
You can't ask us if we love each other
or things like that, okay?

662
00:36:11,976 --> 00:36:13,542
- Just don't ask.
- Are you afraid?

663
00:36:15,844 --> 00:36:18,641
[Could these newlyweds... be the culprits?]

664
00:36:24,377 --> 00:36:28,466
[Yellow Team arrives at A-Pink's studio with
the snack they requested in hand.]

665
00:36:29,832 --> 00:36:32,841
- Is A-Pink here?
- Eun Ji.

666
00:36:32,842 --> 00:36:35,800
Miss Jung Eun Ji?
Do you see her anywhere?

667
00:36:35,801 --> 00:36:39,125
[Where could A-Pink be?]

668
00:36:47,061 --> 00:36:49,610
- Hello!
- Hello!

669
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:53,866
[The young girls start
chanting for their snack.]

670
00:36:53,867 --> 00:36:57,849
- What is all that?
- We don't know. We just got it ourselves.

671
00:36:59,023 --> 00:37:01,472
They were just delivered to us.

672
00:37:01,473 --> 00:37:03,710
[Their rehearsal studio
is full of gift boxes.]

673
00:37:03,711 --> 00:37:07,081
No, don't give them anything yet.

674
00:37:07,082 --> 00:37:10,497
- This isn't the delivery we were meaning.
- These were all delivered here.

675
00:37:11,602 --> 00:37:14,577
[Then all these are supposed to be clues?]

676
00:37:16,342 --> 00:37:19,691
So you guys...
you guys must be the culprits.

677
00:37:21,066 --> 00:37:23,859
- Gary is...
- Gary's disappeared?

678
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:26,220
- Gary's been kidnapped.
- Really?

679
00:37:27,073 --> 00:37:31,002
[Something feels a little suspicious...]

680
00:37:31,003 --> 00:37:33,660
See?
Something feels really off.

681
00:37:34,546 --> 00:37:36,568
[Starting their investigation.]

682
00:37:36,569 --> 00:37:39,192
- There's nothing else here?
- This is your delivery?

683
00:37:39,193 --> 00:37:41,151
- Thank you for the snack.
- Thank you.

684
00:37:41,152 --> 00:37:45,799
- No, you can't start eating that yet.
- You can't take it back from us now.

685
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,766
You can only eat after we find our next clue.

686
00:37:47,767 --> 00:37:51,192
You guys could be the culprits.
Don't even think about stepping out of here.

687
00:37:51,193 --> 00:37:54,908
- Let's look for it together.
- Shut the door.

688
00:37:54,909 --> 00:37:58,018
- Okay, we'll help you.
- Gary could be in here.

689
00:37:58,019 --> 00:38:00,895
[Gary's kidnappers... just who are you?]

690
00:38:00,896 --> 00:38:04,358
We have to find something.
But I don't think this is the same delivery.

691
00:38:06,330 --> 00:38:07,939
What is this?

692
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:11,090
- You haven't seen Gary?
- No, we haven't.

693
00:38:11,091 --> 00:38:14,861
- You haven't seen Gary?
- All we got was a delivery.

694
00:38:14,862 --> 00:38:17,042
And we just heard that he's been taken.

695
00:38:17,390 --> 00:38:20,247
[Then could something be inside
one of these boxes?]

696
00:38:20,248 --> 00:38:21,990
I feel like something could be in here.

697
00:38:23,131 --> 00:38:25,384
I really think something could be in here.

698
00:38:25,385 --> 00:38:29,313
[Never-ending boxes...]

699
00:38:31,512 --> 00:38:33,699
[A dud!]

700
00:38:37,470 --> 00:38:41,261
None of you girls can leave this room
since you could be the culprits.

701
00:38:41,262 --> 00:38:42,648
- Okay.
- Okay.

702
00:38:42,649 --> 00:38:44,940
[Could these girls be the culprits?]

703
00:38:45,775 --> 00:38:49,257
Couldn't it be possible that Gary could've
been held hostage in this cafe earlier?

704
00:38:49,258 --> 00:38:53,167
[If these two are Gary's kidnappers,
then it means Gary could be in here.]

705
00:38:53,168 --> 00:38:54,860
Can you come with us?

706
00:38:56,103 --> 00:38:59,249
[Asking them to come along since
they're a flight risk.]

707
00:38:59,250 --> 00:39:02,265
- Come with us.
- We need your cooperation.

708
00:39:04,601 --> 00:39:07,230
Go search upstairs,
and I'll go search downstairs.

709
00:39:07,231 --> 00:39:09,535
Why are you looking for Gary?

710
00:39:09,536 --> 00:39:12,000
We have to find Gary.

711
00:39:12,809 --> 00:39:17,243
- Where's Gary? Be honest with me.
- I feel bad seeing how hard you're searching.

712
00:39:17,244 --> 00:39:20,058
Where could he be?
There's a reason why you guys are here.

713
00:39:20,726 --> 00:39:23,419
There's either a clue in here,
or you two are the culprits.

714
00:39:24,258 --> 00:39:27,668
- Don't you agree?
- Do you even know what you're looking for?

715
00:39:27,669 --> 00:39:29,665
- I don't know either.
- You're just looking around?

716
00:39:30,832 --> 00:39:32,974
There's a basement in here.

717
00:39:32,975 --> 00:39:36,037
[Inspector Yoo heads down to the basement.]

718
00:39:36,038 --> 00:39:38,511
Isn't this the type of space where
Gary was being held earlier?

719
00:39:42,279 --> 00:39:44,583
I really am sorry.

720
00:39:44,584 --> 00:39:47,866
We're not the type of investigators who
go by our gut feelings.

721
00:39:48,697 --> 00:39:50,718
We're taking the scientific approach to this

722
00:39:50,719 --> 00:39:53,640
by watching for any changes in your
behavior or facial expressions.

723
00:39:54,999 --> 00:39:58,179
We're watching out for even the slightest
bit of change in your behavior.

724
00:39:58,180 --> 00:39:59,851
We're very scientific people.

725
00:39:59,852 --> 00:40:02,239
What about this right now is
being scientific?

726
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:06,306
- You're just rummaging around.
- I thought this was a letter.

727
00:40:09,006 --> 00:40:11,424
- I don't know what they're doing.
- Where's our Gary?

728
00:40:11,425 --> 00:40:14,556
I think their concept for the day is,
'Dumb and Dumber'.

729
00:40:14,557 --> 00:40:17,952
- What are you guys talking about?
- We're tough detectives.

730
00:40:18,342 --> 00:40:22,518
- We're being very scientific.
- I feel bad. I wish I knew something.

731
00:40:22,519 --> 00:40:24,706
[Are these two really just out on a date?]

732
00:40:25,150 --> 00:40:27,089
I'm going to find something.

733
00:40:27,697 --> 00:40:30,443
- What are you two looking for?
- Hey!

734
00:40:30,444 --> 00:40:31,842
Look at this!

735
00:40:31,843 --> 00:40:33,415
What is it?

736
00:40:36,151 --> 00:40:39,802
- Did you see how scientific we are?
- You guys are smart.

737
00:40:39,803 --> 00:40:41,692
[Discovers the hidden cellphone...
through their scientific investigation?]

738
00:40:41,693 --> 00:40:43,505
- What is that?
- There's something here.

739
00:40:43,964 --> 00:40:46,467
[A mysterious cellphone,
that's locked down with a passcode.]

740
00:40:46,468 --> 00:40:48,436
- What is it?
- How would we know?

741
00:40:48,437 --> 00:40:51,390
- We need the secret code.
- Tell us what the code is.

742
00:40:51,391 --> 00:40:55,178
- This is our first time seeing the phone.
- Tell us what the code is.

743
00:40:55,179 --> 00:40:57,788
- We've never seen this phone.
- What's the date of your wedding anniversary?

744
00:40:57,789 --> 00:40:59,338
November 29th.

745
00:40:59,339 --> 00:41:03,126
1129.
No, that's not right.

746
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:04,883
How are we to unlock this?

747
00:41:05,521 --> 00:41:07,992
- This is still locked.
- Tell us what the code is right now.

748
00:41:07,993 --> 00:41:09,560
Is it, '0000'?

749
00:41:11,182 --> 00:41:13,539
[It's not '0000' either...]

750
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:16,213
This is driving me crazy.

751
00:41:17,629 --> 00:41:19,980
Do I have to go into my hacking mode?

752
00:41:19,981 --> 00:41:21,851
[Say what?]

753
00:41:21,852 --> 00:41:23,913
Oh yeah...
I forgot that you used to be a hacker.

754
00:41:25,412 --> 00:41:28,594
[The truth we weren't aware of for 40 years-
Yoo Hyuk used to be a hacker.]

755
00:41:30,036 --> 00:41:31,429
Too funny.

756
00:41:31,909 --> 00:41:34,918
I think this is the only thing
we're going to get out of here.

757
00:41:34,919 --> 00:41:36,863
- Let's go back down.
- Let's get out of here.

758
00:41:36,864 --> 00:41:39,573
[Now that they've found their cellphone...]

759
00:41:39,574 --> 00:41:42,831
[It's now time to pay a visit to
Dynamic Duo?]

760
00:41:42,832 --> 00:41:45,135
We need to pay them a visit
and see if they're the culprits.

761
00:41:45,136 --> 00:41:47,214
Good luck catching the culprits.

762
00:41:47,215 --> 00:41:49,987
- Scold them once you get your hands on them.
- Okay.

763
00:41:51,229 --> 00:41:55,883
[But... are these two
really not the culprits?]

764
00:41:57,354 --> 00:41:59,841
[One hour ago.]

765
00:41:59,842 --> 00:42:02,013
- That'll be too hard to find.
- You think?

766
00:42:02,163 --> 00:42:07,070
[These two are the ones who hid
the cellphone under there?]

767
00:42:10,651 --> 00:42:12,881
But why are we the suspects?

768
00:42:12,882 --> 00:42:16,065
- You guys were inside the box of clues.
- Hey, look at this.

769
00:42:16,066 --> 00:42:18,617
[Blank Ji seems to have found something.]

770
00:42:18,618 --> 00:42:20,040
Awesome.

771
00:42:20,942 --> 00:42:23,619
[A puzzle piece?]

772
00:42:25,548 --> 00:42:27,871
We'll get our next clue once
we piece the puzzle back together.

773
00:42:30,913 --> 00:42:34,574
[Piecing the puzzle together.]

774
00:42:36,377 --> 00:42:38,521
Look for a piece that looks like this.

775
00:42:39,481 --> 00:42:43,292
[What could it be? The puzzle is slowly
starting to come together.]

776
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:47,605
- This is hard.
- I'm really bad at things like this.

777
00:42:47,606 --> 00:42:50,961
[What could the completed puzzle
be a picture of?]

778
00:42:51,495 --> 00:42:54,940
When we saw that footage of
Gary being kidnapped earlier...

779
00:42:55,705 --> 00:43:00,761
He didn't seem all that glad to see the person
nor did he seem all that shocked either.

780
00:43:00,762 --> 00:43:02,451
- Yeah, you're right.
- If...

781
00:43:02,452 --> 00:43:05,658
- I really don't think it was A-Pink.
- He would've given a big smile if it was.

782
00:43:05,659 --> 00:43:07,796
He would've looked really elated.

783
00:43:07,797 --> 00:43:09,987
The way I see it, it's not A-Pink.

784
00:43:09,988 --> 00:43:11,657
No, I don't think it's A-Pink.

785
00:43:11,658 --> 00:43:14,534
I have a feeling...
that it's Gaeko and Choi Ja.

786
00:43:15,874 --> 00:43:18,196
I called Jae Suk earlier,
and he just texted me back.

787
00:43:18,197 --> 00:43:21,354
<i>I'm in the middle of my class right now.
I'll call you back when the class is over?</i>

788
00:43:24,107 --> 00:43:26,192
What is this?

789
00:43:32,686 --> 00:43:35,480
[Blank Ji is dismantling
their completed puzzle.]

790
00:43:35,999 --> 00:43:38,368
[Destroying the hint!]

791
00:43:38,369 --> 00:43:40,981
- Thank you.
- Thank you!

792
00:43:40,982 --> 00:43:43,437
[Did they find any helpful clues?]

793
00:43:45,224 --> 00:43:48,398
- We just need one more clue.
- One more clue, and I think we'll know.

794
00:43:48,872 --> 00:43:51,726
- There could be accomplices.
- Yes, that's possible.

795
00:43:51,727 --> 00:43:54,868
We can't be thinking that
there's only one culprit.

796
00:43:54,869 --> 00:43:57,041
You're right.
We need to be suspicious of everyone.

797
00:43:57,042 --> 00:44:00,644
What do you think this phone means?

798
00:44:00,645 --> 00:44:03,565
I feel like we need to unlock this
if we want to get our clue.

799
00:44:03,566 --> 00:44:05,117
But I don't know what the passcode is.

800
00:44:05,118 --> 00:44:06,927
You don't think it's Jung In
and Jung Chi either?

801
00:44:06,928 --> 00:44:09,847
No, I really don't think
its Jung Chi or Jung In.

802
00:44:09,848 --> 00:44:13,055
No, I don't think so either.
We shouldn't tell anyone what we think.

803
00:44:13,421 --> 00:44:15,752
We shouldn't tell anyone else that
we don't think it's them.

804
00:44:19,868 --> 00:44:22,647
What is that?
Are you getting a video call?

805
00:44:24,228 --> 00:44:26,008
- Gary!
- Gary!

806
00:44:29,856 --> 00:44:32,199
[It's really Gary!]

807
00:44:33,361 --> 00:44:35,049
- Gary!
- It's Gary?

808
00:44:35,050 --> 00:44:37,421
[Their first phone call since his kidnapping.]

809
00:44:38,752 --> 00:44:40,827
Just wait a little bit longer.
We're going to come rescue you.

810
00:44:42,881 --> 00:44:44,757
Where are you?

811
00:44:46,866 --> 00:44:51,429
[Can't really understand what he's saying
because of the mask blocking his mouth...]

812
00:44:51,430 --> 00:44:53,185
I can't hear you!
What did you say?

813
00:44:53,186 --> 00:44:55,445
- Gary!
- We want to find you, and we need more clues.

814
00:44:55,446 --> 00:44:57,916
Is it Choi Ja, or Gaeko?
Who's the culprit?

815
00:44:59,791 --> 00:45:03,330
- You don't know?
- Who is it? Who did you see earlier?

816
00:45:03,331 --> 00:45:05,820
- Tell us something.
- Where are you?

817
00:45:05,821 --> 00:45:09,180
[Who took Gary?
And where is he right now?]

818
00:45:11,673 --> 00:45:14,030
No... what happened?

819
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:19,902
[Gary's call is abruptly disconnected!]

820
00:45:23,256 --> 00:45:24,491
What happened?

821
00:45:24,492 --> 00:45:26,050
What's going on here?

822
00:45:27,471 --> 00:45:28,872
No.

823
00:45:29,746 --> 00:45:31,822
Gary, no!

824
00:45:39,190 --> 00:45:42,630
[Blue Team is paying Dynamic Duo a visit.]

825
00:45:45,761 --> 00:45:49,484
- Who is it?
- Hey, Dog nose. It's me, Big-nose.

826
00:45:52,122 --> 00:45:54,928
- Choi Ja. You're here too?
- What are you two doing here?

827
00:45:54,929 --> 00:45:58,350
- Are you okay?
- I don't know. Am I okay?

828
00:45:59,116 --> 00:46:01,903
- So this is your office?
- This is our work studio.

829
00:46:01,904 --> 00:46:04,071
- This is where we work on our music.
- Really?

830
00:46:04,072 --> 00:46:06,265
- You guys are the culprits, right?
- What?

831
00:46:06,266 --> 00:46:08,430
- That's the first thing you ask?
- Sorry about that.

832
00:46:08,431 --> 00:46:12,268
- Are you guys the culprits?
- You are, aren't you? Take a seat.

833
00:46:13,001 --> 00:46:15,501
[Makes them sit back down.]

834
00:46:15,502 --> 00:46:18,048
- Did you see Gary this morning?
- This morning?

835
00:46:18,049 --> 00:46:20,210
- Gary? No, we didn't see him.
- You saw him, didn't you?

836
00:46:20,211 --> 00:46:22,124
[Nonstop questioning.]

837
00:46:22,125 --> 00:46:24,980
- I have no idea what's going on.
- Did you see Gary?

838
00:46:24,981 --> 00:46:28,605
- No, I haven't seen Gary at all.
- I haven't seen Gary in a week.

839
00:46:28,606 --> 00:46:33,118
- Did you two...
- I feel like we're getting interrogated.

840
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:35,854
- So tell us the truth.
- Tell us why you kidnapped Gary.

841
00:46:35,855 --> 00:46:38,593
We really haven't seen Gary
at all this week.

842
00:46:38,594 --> 00:46:41,451
How could you suspect such innocent
looking people as us?

843
00:46:42,617 --> 00:46:45,544
Of all people, you can't be saying things
like that to Big-nosed Brother.

844
00:46:45,545 --> 00:46:48,306
Let's not be like this to each other.
Come on, Dog-nose!

845
00:46:48,688 --> 00:46:52,187
- Yes, Big-nose.
- Come on, we're both nose people.

846
00:46:53,137 --> 00:46:56,724
Then we're going to look around here a bit.
Hope you understand.

847
00:46:56,725 --> 00:47:00,531
You can look around all you want,
but you'll really be wasting your time.

848
00:47:00,532 --> 00:47:03,665
Did you bring a search warrant?
You can't be doing this without a warrant.

849
00:47:03,666 --> 00:47:05,747
You can't search around without a warrant.

850
00:47:05,748 --> 00:47:08,605
What color is your car?

851
00:47:09,402 --> 00:47:11,947
- Mine?
- Is it black?

852
00:47:11,948 --> 00:47:13,675
- It's black, isn't it?
- Why don't you have a seat?

853
00:47:13,676 --> 00:47:16,157
[Making them sit whenever
they're suspicious about something.]

854
00:47:16,158 --> 00:47:18,294
[Big-nose takes a seat too?]

855
00:47:19,864 --> 00:47:21,324
Maybe you should sit down.

856
00:47:21,811 --> 00:47:24,690
I know that we're all friends,
but we can't help this.

857
00:47:24,691 --> 00:47:27,040
We need to wrap up this investigation.

858
00:47:27,041 --> 00:47:31,241
- This is injustice.
- The real culprits are getting away.

859
00:47:31,242 --> 00:47:33,324
- I feel bad for you guys.
- I think you're wasting your time.

860
00:47:33,325 --> 00:47:37,349
- You think A-Pink would be better suspects?
- You know they're not those type of girls.

861
00:47:37,350 --> 00:47:39,922
- Why did you kidnap him?
- This is all we have.

862
00:47:39,923 --> 00:47:42,746
[Wait... that's?]

863
00:47:45,217 --> 00:47:48,724
['Mid' and 'Low' envelopes?]

864
00:47:48,725 --> 00:47:51,353
- This is all we've got.
- We received this earlier.

865
00:47:51,354 --> 00:47:54,941
- This is all we ever got.
- Give us the middle one.

866
00:47:56,015 --> 00:47:58,028
- We can't just give it to you.
- What do you want from us?

867
00:47:58,029 --> 00:48:01,773
Jong Kook and Ha Ha had to
take a test.

868
00:48:01,774 --> 00:48:04,351
[Kkuk and Ro-Ro already took the
top hint after completing a test.]

869
00:48:04,352 --> 00:48:07,413
- Show us how well you can rap.
- Rapping is our...

870
00:48:07,414 --> 00:48:09,935
I used to make my living by rapping.

871
00:48:09,936 --> 00:48:10,974
Seriously?

872
00:48:11,935 --> 00:48:16,232
[Going straight into rap mode.]

873
00:48:18,648 --> 00:48:21,856
[Rap machine, MC Big-nose!]

874
00:48:23,913 --> 00:48:26,671
- He's a rapping machine.
- Oh yeah.

875
00:48:28,588 --> 00:48:32,278
- Why are you writing the lyrics?
- Can you do it impromptu?

876
00:48:32,279 --> 00:48:35,086
Of course!
We can freestyle it.

877
00:48:35,849 --> 00:48:38,896
[Freestyle rap!]

878
00:48:38,897 --> 00:48:42,169
Freestyling fits us better.
We're not the type to write it down.

879
00:48:42,170 --> 00:48:45,589
- This is how I was taught to rap.
- Want us to give you a beat?

880
00:48:47,193 --> 00:48:49,785
[The beats starts to flow right away.]

881
00:49:02,386 --> 00:49:04,085
I can understand that
you're having fun, but...

882
00:49:04,608 --> 00:49:07,607
[Hyuk is trying to put a stop to
Big-nose's rapping.]

883
00:49:09,555 --> 00:49:11,829
If that's how you're going to rap,
then we might as well just talk.

884
00:49:13,615 --> 00:49:16,781
We might as well just have a conversation.
That's not rapping.

885
00:49:19,033 --> 00:49:22,014
- Just take the low hint and go.
- Come on, yo!

886
00:49:23,961 --> 00:49:27,039
[Firing up the atmosphere.]

887
00:49:29,018 --> 00:49:30,875
- Come on, Bro!
- Let's rap this out!

888
00:49:38,615 --> 00:49:41,230
[Meanwhile...]

889
00:49:41,907 --> 00:49:45,525
We were thinking about it, and
the last time you were on the show...

890
00:49:45,526 --> 00:49:49,474
You guys didn't take the win,
so you didn't get the winning gold.

891
00:49:49,475 --> 00:49:52,632
So we're thinking that you're bitter about it
and that's why you kidnapped Gary.

892
00:49:52,633 --> 00:49:55,491
[Could this couple have been the culprits
to have kidnapped Gary?]

893
00:49:55,492 --> 00:49:57,327
Give us our Gary back.

894
00:49:57,328 --> 00:49:59,692
- Where is he?
- How could I have kidnapped him?

895
00:49:59,693 --> 00:50:01,538
[Jung Chi and Jung In are still
claiming their innocence.]

896
00:50:01,975 --> 00:50:04,930
- Give him back. Where's Gary?
- It really isn't me.

897
00:50:04,931 --> 00:50:07,847
- How could I have kidnapped Gary?
- Then who else could've taken him?

898
00:50:08,767 --> 00:50:12,078
Just tell us what it was that
Jae Suk and Suk Jin asked you guys.

899
00:50:13,473 --> 00:50:18,055
They asked us what had happened,
and they asked if we knew where Gary was.

900
00:50:18,056 --> 00:50:21,117
They walked around here for a bit,
and they found something.

901
00:50:24,481 --> 00:50:28,028
[Immediately starts to
search their surroundings.]

902
00:50:29,361 --> 00:50:32,711
This place is quite large.
There's upstairs and downstairs too.

903
00:50:33,811 --> 00:50:36,483
There are three floors.

904
00:50:36,484 --> 00:50:39,259
- I'm going to go downstairs.
- Search downstairs, Ji Hyo.

905
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:44,469
[The newlyweds have finally
found some peace.]

906
00:50:45,443 --> 00:50:47,587
Let's check down in the basement.

907
00:50:47,588 --> 00:50:50,068
[Searching every nook and cranny.]

908
00:50:51,816 --> 00:50:55,183
[Searching thoroughly.]

909
00:50:58,785 --> 00:51:00,446
There's nothing up here.

910
00:51:01,461 --> 00:51:04,215
[Kkuk is also searching
up on the third floor.]

911
00:51:07,739 --> 00:51:09,007
What's this?

912
00:51:11,423 --> 00:51:14,649
[Kkuk discovers the cellphone!]

913
00:51:17,017 --> 00:51:19,800
Come up to the third floor, Dong Hoon.

914
00:51:19,835 --> 00:51:22,039
Come all the way up to the corner area.

915
00:51:32,557 --> 00:51:36,142
[Ji Hyo also discovers the cellphone!]

916
00:51:39,201 --> 00:51:41,411
I need an unlock code.

917
00:51:44,610 --> 00:51:48,365
Do we need to go and find out what
the code is from Jung Chi and Jung In?

918
00:51:49,019 --> 00:51:51,843
From what those A-Pink girls told us...

919
00:51:52,169 --> 00:51:56,925
[Could the secret code have anything to do
with the puzzle from earlier?]

920
00:52:01,037 --> 00:52:03,628
[Still ongoing with their freestyle rapping.]

921
00:52:05,992 --> 00:52:08,004
- What is this?
- What are you doing?

922
00:52:08,005 --> 00:52:10,396
[ A brand new style of rap?]

923
00:52:11,005 --> 00:52:14,214
[A very unique song.]

924
00:52:14,877 --> 00:52:17,200
[His feet are automatically moving along
to the beat?]

925
00:52:18,285 --> 00:52:19,975
Just give us the low hint.

926
00:52:20,654 --> 00:52:22,294
[His face is now beet red.]

927
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:25,486
[They don't deserve anything better
than the low hint?]

928
00:52:26,397 --> 00:52:28,444
What the heck was that?

929
00:52:28,964 --> 00:52:31,697
- That was the absolute worst.
- What do you mean, the worst?

930
00:52:33,226 --> 00:52:36,743
[The two middle aged rappers are
disappointed with their feedback.]

931
00:52:37,620 --> 00:52:40,471
We're leaving only because we
don't have a lot of time.

932
00:52:40,932 --> 00:52:43,816
We're leaving because of our lack of time.

933
00:52:45,206 --> 00:52:47,726
[Any more time, and they could've been
dubbed the newest rappers on the scene?]

934
00:52:48,122 --> 00:52:50,673
[His passion for rapping
has been discovered.]

935
00:52:51,333 --> 00:52:54,584
[Their numerous sheets of lyrics.]

936
00:52:54,585 --> 00:52:57,611
- We'll email you more in the morning.
- Okay, we'll be expecting it.

937
00:52:58,035 --> 00:53:03,040
- We really were expecting something.
- I really wanted to show you something new.

938
00:53:03,545 --> 00:53:07,607
I haven't shown you my new cicada rap.
You guys would flip out if you saw.

939
00:53:08,068 --> 00:53:11,731
If you saw me rap like this,
you guys would just flip out.

940
00:53:12,617 --> 00:53:15,717
[His one emergency weapon?
The cicada rap.]

941
00:53:15,718 --> 00:53:18,570
- You're lucky that I'm out of time.
- I've seen him do it before.

942
00:53:19,482 --> 00:53:22,796
You know who Eminem is, right?
I'm Meminem.

943
00:53:22,797 --> 00:53:24,460
I'm Meminem.

944
00:53:25,337 --> 00:53:28,176
- You should've sang about that.
- You should've used that in the lyrics.

945
00:53:30,220 --> 00:53:33,654
- Wait, we'll give you another chance.
- Another chance at the mid hint.

946
00:53:33,655 --> 00:53:35,761
Rap about being the Meminem,
and we'll give you the mid hint.

947
00:53:35,762 --> 00:53:37,320
Okay, Meminem.

948
00:53:37,321 --> 00:53:39,404
[Meminem immediately starts
to write the lyrics.]

949
00:53:41,273 --> 00:53:43,598
- I think he may have a chance.
- This is American style rap.

950
00:53:44,685 --> 00:53:48,525
The God of American rapping is...

951
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:51,639
His name is... Eminem.

952
00:53:52,013 --> 00:53:56,135
The God of Running Man's
rap is... Meminem.

953
00:53:58,041 --> 00:54:03,047
- And...
- I shout out all the time, 'Mem, Mem...'

954
00:54:03,978 --> 00:54:07,278
[This is what you call, cicada rap!]

955
00:54:12,621 --> 00:54:14,481
- That's perfect!
- Doesn't that sound good?

956
00:54:14,482 --> 00:54:16,887
- You may have something.
- I'm telling you that we've got this.

957
00:54:16,888 --> 00:54:18,557
- We're fine.
- This is good.

958
00:54:19,020 --> 00:54:21,580
[Cicada rap position.]

959
00:54:21,581 --> 00:54:24,084
[Meminem featuring Big-nose.]

960
00:54:38,945 --> 00:54:41,816
[This is cicada rap!]

961
00:54:43,102 --> 00:54:46,110
[Big-nose and Meminem!]

962
00:54:51,532 --> 00:54:54,524
[A rapping style that only needs something
for them to cling themselves to.]

963
00:54:59,545 --> 00:55:02,461
[Even the ultimate hip-hop duo can't help
but break out into an applause.]

964
00:55:03,869 --> 00:55:07,031
You saw that, right?
It wasn't because we couldn't do it.

965
00:55:10,105 --> 00:55:12,261
[Meminem's performance is making the duo
give all the clues that they have to them.]

966
00:55:12,262 --> 00:55:13,817
You want the song for yourselves,
don't you?

967
00:55:13,818 --> 00:55:16,653
If you ever need any rap lyrics,
you just let me know.

968
00:55:17,924 --> 00:55:20,063
- We've got a lot more where that came from.
- We can come up with a song on the spot.

969
00:55:20,064 --> 00:55:22,496
You saw how quickly we wrote the lyrics?
It only takes us five seconds to write it.

970
00:55:22,497 --> 00:55:24,378
You can use our song if you want.

971
00:55:24,379 --> 00:55:26,897
We're going to get going.
Bye guys.

972
00:55:26,898 --> 00:55:28,450
[Their cicada rap earned themselves
the mid-level hint.]

973
00:55:29,012 --> 00:55:32,693
- Squeezing got something out of them.
- What do you mean, squeeze?

974
00:55:34,859 --> 00:55:37,496
[Meminem and Big-nose's pride is hurt.]

975
00:55:41,063 --> 00:55:43,643
We've got a lot more than that.
We're just saving it for later.

976
00:55:43,644 --> 00:55:46,849
- What's that?
- You really want to see?

977
00:55:52,208 --> 00:55:54,955
[Ah... so this is what they meant.]

978
00:55:57,630 --> 00:56:00,856
- We've got a mocking bird rap too.
- A mocking bird?

979
00:56:01,311 --> 00:56:02,754
We've got a variety of different styles.

980
00:56:06,032 --> 00:56:08,442
- We're going to go now.
- Bye.

981
00:56:11,522 --> 00:56:14,875
[They earned themselves the mid-level hint
with their spontaneous cicada rap.]

982
00:56:19,864 --> 00:56:22,670
Low hint only had one card,
and the mid hint had three.

983
00:56:22,671 --> 00:56:25,078
[Three cards inside the mid-level hint...]

984
00:56:25,079 --> 00:56:30,396
[Hip hop, wig mania, fedoras.]

985
00:56:31,828 --> 00:56:33,434
Wig mania?

986
00:56:33,435 --> 00:56:35,464
[Could it be...]

987
00:56:35,465 --> 00:56:37,497
- Isn't it Gil?
- I think it is.

988
00:56:37,498 --> 00:56:41,091
- He wears wigs. Is it Gil?
- It's Gil!

989
00:56:43,470 --> 00:56:46,449
[30 minutes ago.]

990
00:56:46,450 --> 00:56:48,991
[The puzzle that the Yellow Team completed.]

991
00:56:48,992 --> 00:56:51,696
This is Gil.

992
00:56:51,697 --> 00:56:54,728
[That's definitely Gil!]

993
00:56:56,179 --> 00:56:58,184
Why is there a puzzle of Gil?

994
00:56:58,710 --> 00:57:00,721
It has to do with Gil.

995
00:57:00,722 --> 00:57:03,106
[Why is Gil in the puzzle?]

996
00:57:03,107 --> 00:57:05,429
Gil's in that picture too.

997
00:57:05,430 --> 00:57:07,422
Then is Gil the kidnapper?

998
00:57:07,423 --> 00:57:10,847
[Could Gil be the culprit?]

999
00:57:12,357 --> 00:57:14,688
We have the top level hint right here.

1000
00:57:14,689 --> 00:57:17,189
L.
L? What's this?

1001
00:57:17,190 --> 00:57:20,294
[The four cards indicate...]

1002
00:57:20,295 --> 00:57:22,490
What does it say?
Gill?

1003
00:57:22,491 --> 00:57:27,694
[Gil?]

1004
00:57:34,466 --> 00:57:37,418
[I'm sure that they
all must've guessed by now.]

1005
00:57:38,626 --> 00:57:42,715
It's the perfect weather for some chasing.

1006
00:57:46,129 --> 00:57:49,518
[Then the Gil that they saw earlier is...]

1007
00:57:49,519 --> 00:57:52,840
I'm sure they must've started to figure out
that it must've been me by now.

1008
00:57:54,288 --> 00:57:55,692
Shall we get going?

1009
00:57:55,693 --> 00:57:58,334
[Then it means that Gil is...]

1010
00:58:03,481 --> 00:58:05,974
[The culprit?]

1011
00:58:07,402 --> 00:58:11,822
I know of a place...
that makes amazing udon.

1012
00:58:13,534 --> 00:58:16,419
Tofu udon with a ton of
hot pepper flakes.

1013
00:58:17,525 --> 00:58:19,204
We've still got plenty of time
before they catch up to me.

1014
00:58:20,395 --> 00:58:22,965
- Gil is the culprit.
- We need to figure this out.

1015
00:58:24,062 --> 00:58:28,108
- What do we need the passcode for?
- We need it to get the clue.

1016
00:58:28,109 --> 00:58:31,098
We need it to get the information and
figure out where Gary is.

1017
00:58:31,099 --> 00:58:34,442
Everything is pointing to the fact that
Gil is our culprit.

1018
00:58:34,443 --> 00:58:37,977
[All the clues are indicating that
Gil is their culprit]

1019
00:58:40,649 --> 00:58:43,945
[The completed puzzle showed
a picture of Gil...]

1020
00:58:43,946 --> 00:58:45,326
It's Gil.

1021
00:58:46,037 --> 00:58:47,721
Street?

1022
00:58:49,099 --> 00:58:50,839
What are you talking about?

1023
00:58:50,840 --> 00:58:52,519
You think that the secret code
is 'street'?

1024
00:58:52,520 --> 00:58:53,904
Gil!
(Gil=street)

1025
00:58:53,905 --> 00:58:55,471
Let's just try it.

1026
00:58:55,472 --> 00:58:57,839
[It is 'Gil' after all...]

1027
00:58:58,917 --> 00:59:00,649
[That's not the code!]

1028
00:59:02,083 --> 00:59:03,639
Hip hop.

1029
00:59:08,047 --> 00:59:10,163
[That's not the code!]

1030
00:59:11,643 --> 00:59:16,264
The hint that we just got, and the
hint we got from Dynamic Duo earlier.

1031
00:59:18,651 --> 00:59:21,089
- Could that be it?
- You think?

1032
00:59:21,090 --> 00:59:22,537
Could 'Gill' be the passcode?

1033
00:59:26,968 --> 00:59:29,703
[The correct passcode!]

1034
00:59:30,092 --> 00:59:34,269
[The code to the locked cellphone
is, 'Gill'!]

1035
00:59:34,837 --> 00:59:37,988
- Is this the order?
- No, it's 'Gill'.

1036
00:59:37,989 --> 00:59:41,185
[The name the four cards indicated...]

1037
00:59:43,285 --> 00:59:47,408
['Gill' is the code!]

1038
00:59:48,783 --> 00:59:52,179
[Time to go get the culprit?]

1039
00:59:52,180 --> 00:59:54,117
Thank you for all your help.

1040
00:59:54,118 --> 00:59:56,617
- Yes, thank you.
- You guys are our good luck charms.

1041
00:59:58,731 --> 01:00:01,221
[Thinking...]

1042
01:00:01,222 --> 01:00:03,495
If it's Gil... then could it be this?

1043
01:00:03,496 --> 01:00:05,257
Gill?

1044
01:00:05,941 --> 01:00:08,953
- Try it.
- G.I.L.L.

1045
01:00:12,811 --> 01:00:14,983
[The phone is unlocked!]

1046
01:00:14,984 --> 01:00:16,919
- This was the hint.
- I see!

1047
01:00:17,464 --> 01:00:20,119
- There's no need for us to go here then.
- We don't even need to go.

1048
01:00:20,120 --> 01:00:21,687
There's a map.

1049
01:00:21,688 --> 01:00:23,941
It should be indicating to a location.
Where is it pointing to?

1050
01:00:23,942 --> 01:00:26,181
[A map to indicate Gil's location?]

1051
01:00:26,182 --> 01:00:27,595
Are we supposed to chase him down?

1052
01:00:27,596 --> 01:00:30,957
Can you take us to Banpo?
That's our first destination.

1053
01:00:30,958 --> 01:00:34,641
[The phone unlocks to reveal a map
to indicate Gil's location?]

1054
01:00:42,411 --> 01:00:43,963
What did you press?

1055
01:00:44,907 --> 01:00:46,727
What did you just do?

1056
01:00:46,728 --> 01:00:48,887
This is a GPS finder.

1057
01:00:50,237 --> 01:00:52,383
It's a map to help us find where Gil is.

1058
01:00:54,681 --> 01:00:57,403
[Gil is currently in Banpo.]

1059
01:00:57,404 --> 01:00:58,797
- Let's go.
- Let's get on the road.

1060
01:01:02,596 --> 01:01:08,135
I'm going to go and get a big bowl of udon
with a ton of red pepper flakes on it.

1061
01:01:10,516 --> 01:01:13,896
Oh my goodness... here's my first caller.

1062
01:01:13,897 --> 01:01:15,292
Hello?

1063
01:01:15,624 --> 01:01:17,671
- Yes, Jae Suk.
- Where are you?

1064
01:01:18,013 --> 01:01:20,027
Where are you headed?

1065
01:01:20,028 --> 01:01:22,990
I'm heading towards your heart!

1066
01:01:24,689 --> 01:01:27,151
<i>I see that you're not done
here on our show.</i>

1067
01:01:29,236 --> 01:01:32,179
I thought we were finished
filming together.

1068
01:01:33,304 --> 01:01:35,895
No, we're not finished!

1069
01:01:35,896 --> 01:01:38,076
Where are you?
You're the culprit?

1070
01:01:38,764 --> 01:01:44,903
- I don't know!
- Are you by a bus station or something?

1071
01:01:47,027 --> 01:01:48,747
<i>Is that where you're at?
In Banpo?</i>

1072
01:01:49,179 --> 01:01:52,101
We're watching you right now!

1073
01:01:55,337 --> 01:01:58,395
Hello?
How did they know that?

1074
01:01:58,396 --> 01:01:59,992
Lock your window.

1075
01:02:04,086 --> 01:02:05,625
What's going on here?

1076
01:02:05,626 --> 01:02:07,664
How did they know that I was here?

1077
01:02:09,193 --> 01:02:11,714
They know exactly where I'm at.

1078
01:02:12,303 --> 01:02:14,941
Then it means that all the other members
know where I'm at too.

1079
01:02:16,599 --> 01:02:19,652
They must have something to help them
find my location.

1080
01:02:20,413 --> 01:02:23,190
[Gil is smarter than we thought?]

1081
01:02:24,236 --> 01:02:26,753
Then I need to exercise Article 16
of the law.

1082
01:02:29,502 --> 01:02:31,468
He's at the intersection heading
towards Jamwon-Dong.

1083
01:02:31,469 --> 01:02:33,423
[Heading towards Jamwon-Dong.]

1084
01:02:33,424 --> 01:02:37,218
It's been Gil all along.
So he's the kidnapper.

1085
01:02:37,219 --> 01:02:40,685
Seriously...
We've got you now, Gil Sung Joon.

1086
01:02:41,848 --> 01:02:43,470
See?

1087
01:02:43,471 --> 01:02:47,046
- Meminem helped us figure it out.
- Meminem helped us find him.

1088
01:02:47,047 --> 01:02:50,171
[Meminem- So good!]

1089
01:02:50,172 --> 01:02:55,195
[Red Team on Gil's tail!
Off to capture their suspect!]

1090
01:02:55,196 --> 01:02:57,737
He's on the move.
I don't think he's on foot.

1091
01:02:57,772 --> 01:03:01,535
He's moving right now.
He must be in a car.

1092
01:03:02,410 --> 01:03:07,732
[All the teams are fixated on their GPS.]

1093
01:03:09,107 --> 01:03:11,053
He's coming towards us right now.

1094
01:03:12,109 --> 01:03:16,399
[Gil is heading straights towards
the Red Team on the same road!]

1095
01:03:17,050 --> 01:03:18,744
We could be passing him right now.

1096
01:03:18,745 --> 01:03:22,080
[They could even be passing each other!]

1097
01:03:22,928 --> 01:03:26,476
This is starting to get fun.
I'm starting to get into this.

1098
01:03:28,239 --> 01:03:32,577
[They're closing in on each other.]

1099
01:03:32,578 --> 01:03:34,650
This is where we're at right now.

1100
01:03:36,304 --> 01:03:40,551
[Gil is stopped at the light
at the intersection.]

1101
01:03:40,552 --> 01:03:42,769
He's stopped at the light right there.
I bet that he's right over there.

1102
01:03:44,455 --> 01:03:46,529
I still can't forget the look in their eyes.

1103
01:03:46,530 --> 01:03:49,424
Telling me to leave as soon as
I gave them the hint.

1104
01:03:50,593 --> 01:03:52,479
Where did they think I was going to go?

1105
01:03:54,237 --> 01:03:56,551
Since he's over there right now...

1106
01:04:00,253 --> 01:04:03,435
This feels more like Running Man now.

1107
01:04:03,436 --> 01:04:06,665
I haven't done anything much so far.
I've been stuck too long at a standstill.

1108
01:04:08,882 --> 01:04:12,449
[They're right next to one another!]

1109
01:04:13,994 --> 01:04:16,239
[Just then!]

1110
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:19,410
[That car going by is Gil's car!]

1111
01:04:20,816 --> 01:04:25,340
[They just passed by one another!]

1112
01:04:25,341 --> 01:04:27,230
They know exactly where I'm at.

1113
01:04:27,916 --> 01:04:29,698
He just passed by us.

1114
01:04:30,652 --> 01:04:34,141
[Lost Gil right in front of their eyes...]

1115
01:04:34,142 --> 01:04:36,063
Where did he go?

1116
01:04:36,064 --> 01:04:40,205
[Where could Gil be going?]

1117
01:04:40,206 --> 01:04:42,830
- Is he trying to get on the highway?
- He's right by the highway right now.

1118
01:04:43,780 --> 01:04:46,238
I think he's trying to get on Gyungbu highway.

1119
01:04:46,239 --> 01:04:48,695
[Getting closer to the entryway
to Kyungbu highway.]

1120
01:04:50,133 --> 01:04:55,685
[All three teams are seeing
exactly what Gil is up to.]

1121
01:04:55,686 --> 01:04:57,541
- He's already on it.
- He's on the highway.

1122
01:04:57,542 --> 01:05:02,052
- Is he going to Bundang?
- Either Bundang or Pangyo. Keep going.

1123
01:05:03,476 --> 01:05:08,645
Where are you in such a rush to get to?
Why are you driving on Kyungbu highway?

1124
01:05:10,040 --> 01:05:11,712
Gil Sung Joon.

1125
01:05:12,446 --> 01:05:16,946
We can see that you're passing Woomyunggyo.
You're just driving right along.

1126
01:05:16,947 --> 01:05:20,435
We're right on your tail right now.

1127
01:05:20,436 --> 01:05:23,866
I think we're going to be catching up
to your car in just a few moments.

1128
01:05:23,867 --> 01:05:27,479
And you may get slightly hurt
during the arresting process.

1129
01:05:27,968 --> 01:05:31,014
- You're being too harsh with your words.
- Yes, sorry.

1130
01:05:31,015 --> 01:05:35,636
My actions are harsher than my words.
Which I will show you later.

1131
01:05:35,637 --> 01:05:39,928
Let me just make one thing clear.
If that's the way you guys want to play

1132
01:05:39,929 --> 01:05:43,300
then I can't give you any of the information
that I know and have.

1133
01:05:43,652 --> 01:05:46,671
No, we'll just get that information
out of your throat ourselves.

1134
01:05:48,141 --> 01:05:50,498
In that case,
come meet me in Bundang.

1135
01:05:50,499 --> 01:05:55,349
Anyway, we're on your tail right now.

1136
01:05:55,350 --> 01:05:57,630
- Well see you later, Gil Sung Joon.
- Okay.

1137
01:05:59,368 --> 01:06:01,929
There must be a tracker of some sorts on me.

1138
01:06:01,930 --> 01:06:05,410
What the heck?
Where is the tracker?

1139
01:06:08,396 --> 01:06:10,854
Ah, it must be on the car.

1140
01:06:11,355 --> 01:06:15,535
[The tracker is actually on his phone!
Mistakenly thinks that it's on his car.]

1141
01:06:15,536 --> 01:06:18,832
Then there's no point in trying to
thwart them off right now.

1142
01:06:20,689 --> 01:06:23,581
- Hey, he just got off the highway.
- Off where?

1143
01:06:23,582 --> 01:06:26,557
- Hangyo exit?
- He must be heading to Bundang.

1144
01:06:26,558 --> 01:06:28,298
Can you take us to Seohyun-ro?

1145
01:06:30,375 --> 01:06:34,057
[Where could Gil be going?]

1146
01:06:34,058 --> 01:06:35,697
I wonder how I can shake them off?

1147
01:06:37,803 --> 01:06:40,709
[The destination he's heading to is...]

1148
01:06:41,675 --> 01:06:44,446
['N' building in Bundang.]

1149
01:06:49,445 --> 01:06:55,726
[This is the place...
where Gary is being held captive!]

1150
01:06:57,048 --> 01:06:58,875
I need to get rid of this car first.

1151
01:06:59,607 --> 01:07:02,665
[Wanting to get rid of the car from thinking
that the tracker is somewhere in the car.]

1152
01:07:04,863 --> 01:07:06,656
He's at Jeongjayeok.

1153
01:07:08,963 --> 01:07:13,758
I bet it'll really confuse them if I leave
the car parked in the parking garage.

1154
01:07:14,284 --> 01:07:16,823
But is the tracker really hidden
somewhere on the car?

1155
01:07:17,358 --> 01:07:20,413
[No!
The tracker in on your cellphone!]

1156
01:07:25,092 --> 01:07:26,980
[Car is parked!]

1157
01:07:26,981 --> 01:07:32,133
[Just then, he makes a phone call
to someone.]

1158
01:07:32,134 --> 01:07:33,520
Gary.

1159
01:07:33,521 --> 01:07:38,532
[Gary?]

1160
01:07:38,533 --> 01:07:40,264
Gary.

1161
01:07:40,572 --> 01:07:43,716
[Hasn't Gary been kidnapped?]

1162
01:07:44,907 --> 01:07:47,688
[It's Kang Gary!]

1163
01:07:48,378 --> 01:07:50,648
[How can this be!]

1164
01:07:50,649 --> 01:07:51,912
Hello?

1165
01:07:52,555 --> 01:07:55,605
[What is going on here?]

1166
01:07:57,265 --> 01:08:00,335
[The kidnapper?
The victim?]

1167
01:08:01,493 --> 01:08:04,161
I've been hearing rumors that
you're doing a really good job.

1168
01:08:04,162 --> 01:08:05,709
How about you?
Did you do a good job?

1169
01:08:06,240 --> 01:08:09,437
[Accomplices?]

1170
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:16,226
[Nine o'clock this morning.]

1171
01:08:16,227 --> 01:08:18,763
It's nice to see you.
We're Gary and Gil, a.k.a. Leessang.

1172
01:08:18,764 --> 01:08:20,188
It's nice to see everyone.

1173
01:08:20,189 --> 01:08:22,143
What are you doing?

1174
01:08:22,144 --> 01:08:24,329
Why are you acting like that?

1175
01:08:24,330 --> 01:08:27,118
The name of today's race is...

1176
01:08:27,536 --> 01:08:29,813
The Christmas Nightmare.

1177
01:08:29,814 --> 01:08:32,216
Gary's kidnapping case.

1178
01:08:34,276 --> 01:08:36,298
This is fun.

1179
01:08:37,059 --> 01:08:39,053
Are we on the same team?

1180
01:08:39,054 --> 01:08:41,216
The two of us are supposed to
fool everyone else?

1181
01:08:41,217 --> 01:08:44,674
He's more of a foe than a friend.

1182
01:08:44,675 --> 01:08:46,706
I don't know if we can work well together.

1183
01:08:46,707 --> 01:08:50,145
[This is when Leessang's
Christmas Nightmare began.]

1184
01:08:50,472 --> 01:08:53,336
[During their morning mission opening...]

1185
01:08:54,280 --> 01:08:59,097
[Gary purposely didn't show up after
promising Blank Ji that he'd be her partner.]

1186
01:08:59,098 --> 01:09:02,822
What if she continues to wait around?
I feel like she's going to wait all day.

1187
01:09:04,848 --> 01:09:09,965
[Even then... Gil was with him all along.]

1188
01:09:10,613 --> 01:09:13,702
[Even when Kwang Soo had called...]

1189
01:09:13,703 --> 01:09:15,630
There's not even a camera in the bathroom.

1190
01:09:15,631 --> 01:09:19,317
- Can you stick the mic in there?
- Why do I have to hold out the mic for him?

1191
01:09:22,290 --> 01:09:24,011
Answer the phone.
I've got the mic outside the door.

1192
01:09:27,365 --> 01:09:33,017
[And the kidnapped video footage
that the members saw earlier...]

1193
01:09:33,018 --> 01:09:36,300
[Was taped by Gil himself!]

1194
01:09:36,301 --> 01:09:37,610
How as my acting?

1195
01:09:38,942 --> 01:09:42,594
- I think you've tied it too tight.
- You have to if you want them to believe you.

1196
01:09:44,507 --> 01:09:48,607
[When he was kidnapped
and dragged off to the car...]

1197
01:09:50,106 --> 01:09:55,411
[The person that Gary saw in the car...
was Gil.]

1198
01:09:56,101 --> 01:09:58,760
[A perfect kidnapping scene!]

1199
01:09:59,428 --> 01:10:02,956
Let's all make them suspect you
right at the start.

1200
01:10:02,957 --> 01:10:04,368
- Right from the get go?
- Right from the get go.

1201
01:10:04,369 --> 01:10:08,826
Should your number be the last call
on my call log?

1202
01:10:08,827 --> 01:10:12,584
Then they're all totally
going to think that it's me.

1203
01:10:12,585 --> 01:10:14,692
What's this number right here?

1204
01:10:15,592 --> 01:10:20,300
[They all fell for the bait.
Everyone came to see Gil as they predicted.]

1205
01:10:20,301 --> 01:10:24,601
Then I'll go back to my house
and act like I was just leaving my house.

1206
01:10:24,602 --> 01:10:27,266
Your role in this is very important
from this point on.

1207
01:10:27,267 --> 01:10:29,853
The way I see it, it would be much better
if none of the cameras even followed me in.

1208
01:10:29,854 --> 01:10:34,261
No cameras, or mics.
As if I was really just leaving my house.

1209
01:10:34,262 --> 01:10:37,869
He's really flustered right now.
He had nothing on him.

1210
01:10:37,870 --> 01:10:40,700
[Gil's stellar acting skills totally
tricked all the Running man members.]

1211
01:10:40,701 --> 01:10:43,174
- He really looks like he was just at the gym.
- He must be telling the truth.

1212
01:10:43,752 --> 01:10:47,674
But if I were to go in there,
it would be me against all six of them.

1213
01:10:48,409 --> 01:10:53,448
[Gary's plans to lure in the attention
of his fellow members even further.]

1214
01:10:55,200 --> 01:10:58,987
[That's none other than his
delivery package.]

1215
01:10:58,988 --> 01:11:02,143
[Gary's the one who sent the package himself!]

1216
01:11:02,567 --> 01:11:04,776
[And also...]

1217
01:11:05,706 --> 01:11:06,993
Brother.

1218
01:11:06,994 --> 01:11:08,761
- Brother.
- Hi Gary.

1219
01:11:10,726 --> 01:11:13,608
[He paid an early visit to Dynamic Duo.]

1220
01:11:15,482 --> 01:11:17,326
You have to buy me as much
time as you can.

1221
01:11:17,327 --> 01:11:19,850
- Keep talking to them?
- Drag it out?

1222
01:11:20,345 --> 01:11:23,078
Hey, Jung In.
Where are you?

1223
01:11:23,846 --> 01:11:25,724
Congratulations on getting married.

1224
01:11:25,725 --> 01:11:27,798
- Congratulations.
- Thanks, Gary.

1225
01:11:27,799 --> 01:11:30,830
I don't even know what to get you.
But we can talk about that some other time.

1226
01:11:30,831 --> 01:11:34,002
- What's this about?
- I need you and Jung Chi to help me out.

1227
01:11:34,003 --> 01:11:37,066
[Asking the newlyweds for their help.]

1228
01:11:37,067 --> 01:11:39,074
These are clues.

1229
01:11:39,075 --> 01:11:42,908
You have to hide these for me,
and make it really hard for them to find.

1230
01:11:42,909 --> 01:11:45,831
- Hide them all separately?
- Yes, that's right.

1231
01:11:45,832 --> 01:11:47,554
Hide them all separately.

1232
01:11:49,934 --> 01:11:52,900
[And lastly, Gary-Pink.]

1233
01:11:52,901 --> 01:11:56,324
The most important thing is,
you can't tell them that you saw me.

1234
01:11:56,325 --> 01:11:57,471
Of course not.

1235
01:11:57,472 --> 01:11:59,127
[Delivering the packages himself to
make sure nothing gets said.]

1236
01:12:00,211 --> 01:12:03,848
[All these were planned out by
Leessang themselves!]

1237
01:12:03,849 --> 01:12:09,431
You have to make sure not to get your plan
caught by any others for the next 12 hours.

1238
01:12:09,789 --> 01:12:14,352
If the two of you can stand on the platform
together at the final location, then you win.

1239
01:12:14,353 --> 01:12:16,482
[Leessang wins if they can stand together
on the platform at the final location.]

1240
01:12:18,324 --> 01:12:20,925
[The gate to this final stage will open
only when the set time has been reached.]

1241
01:12:20,926 --> 01:12:25,181
[Everything will burst into bubbles if Gary is
brought up onto the platform by others.]

1242
01:12:25,182 --> 01:12:29,989
[Leessang's kidnapping case-
Will they be able to succeed?]

1243
01:12:30,707 --> 01:12:32,473
What about you?
Did you do a good job?

1244
01:12:32,841 --> 01:12:38,755
There's not too much that I could do.
I just sent them a video to distract them.

1245
01:12:38,756 --> 01:12:42,613
[A video file that he purposely sent to
the members to thwart their suspicions away.]

1246
01:12:46,512 --> 01:12:49,625
- I called them on video.
- Right now...

1247
01:12:49,626 --> 01:12:51,574
We've got 45 minutes left to go.

1248
01:12:51,575 --> 01:12:56,084
We have 45 minutes to go back to that
building where we started this morning.

1249
01:12:56,647 --> 01:13:00,008
You and I really have to work on
timing our plan perfectly.

1250
01:13:01,107 --> 01:13:03,309
And we have to meet back
at that building.

1251
01:13:03,310 --> 01:13:06,227
If you can buy me some more time...

1252
01:13:06,621 --> 01:13:09,217
then I'll go hide myself inside the building

1253
01:13:09,961 --> 01:13:12,775
and meet you at the platform
when the time comes.

1254
01:13:12,776 --> 01:13:19,582
I don't think that any of them know that
you and I are in on this together.

1255
01:13:20,289 --> 01:13:22,895
No, I doubt they know.
I'm sure they're all only suspecting you.

1256
01:13:23,396 --> 01:13:25,927
- Then stall.
- Okay, I got it.

1257
01:13:26,389 --> 01:13:28,258
- I'll go and hide somewhere.
- Okay.

1258
01:13:28,259 --> 01:13:30,689
- I'll see you at nine o'clock.
- Okay.

1259
01:13:30,690 --> 01:13:32,744
[Agrees to meet at nine o'clock
in front of the platform.]

1260
01:13:36,357 --> 01:13:39,542
He had me tied up so tight
that it's way too easy to get myself out.

1261
01:13:43,061 --> 01:13:46,506
[Heading out to find a place
to hide until nine o'clock.]

1262
01:13:47,347 --> 01:13:48,754
I have to go hide somewhere.

1263
01:13:58,937 --> 01:14:00,887
It's an octagon.

1264
01:14:01,276 --> 01:14:05,721
[The final platform is inside the
octagonal cage on the first floor.]

1265
01:14:05,722 --> 01:14:08,456
[The door is still tightly locked up.]

1266
01:14:11,260 --> 01:14:14,655
How am I supposed to get in here?
I can't get in if Jong Kook is here.

1267
01:14:17,873 --> 01:14:19,630
I think I need to go into hiding first.

1268
01:14:20,046 --> 01:14:21,618
I wonder where I should hide.

1269
01:14:23,232 --> 01:14:25,077
I need to get rid of the car first.

1270
01:14:25,743 --> 01:14:27,595
I'll leave the car parked here.

1271
01:14:27,596 --> 01:14:30,324
[Leaving the car that he suspects to
be tracked parked in the garage.]

1272
01:14:41,234 --> 01:14:43,256
[Nervously walks out of the garage with
uncertainty of who may pop out at him.]

1273
01:14:43,257 --> 01:14:48,274
[The three teams that have
been on his tail...]

1274
01:14:48,591 --> 01:14:50,856
- Hello?
- Hey, Gil.

1275
01:14:50,857 --> 01:14:52,817
[The Blue Team calls him on his phone.]

1276
01:14:52,818 --> 01:14:57,491
- Tell us where you're at.
- Come find me for yourself.

1277
01:14:57,492 --> 01:14:59,118
Can't you even do that?

1278
01:14:59,119 --> 01:15:02,738
- Seriously...
- You little fatty!

1279
01:15:02,739 --> 01:15:05,186
- You done talking, Fatty?
- Fatty?

1280
01:15:05,187 --> 01:15:07,036
- That's right, Fatty!
- Yeah, Fatty!

1281
01:15:07,037 --> 01:15:10,126
I'm just a little stocky.
I'm not a fatty!

1282
01:15:10,127 --> 01:15:14,512
Seriously.
You're dead if we get our hands on you.

1283
01:15:14,513 --> 01:15:18,450
- Then come and get me if you can.
- You just wait for us.

1284
01:15:18,451 --> 01:15:20,516
Fine, come and get me.

1285
01:15:23,579 --> 01:15:26,558
Where does this mean he's going?
I'm not really sure I get this.

1286
01:15:27,274 --> 01:15:29,313
I feel like I'm going to lose it.

1287
01:15:32,573 --> 01:15:33,965
You startled me.

1288
01:15:34,519 --> 01:15:37,348
[Super anxious at this point.
Scared at even the slightest sound.]

1289
01:15:37,349 --> 01:15:38,742
This is just the beginning.

1290
01:15:39,388 --> 01:15:45,182
I have to keep my eyes open when I walk
because you never know who'll pop out.

1291
01:15:45,643 --> 01:15:47,865
Always have to be on the lookout
as to where I can escape to.

1292
01:15:48,950 --> 01:15:51,238
We're almost there.
We're at Jeonjayoek right now.

1293
01:15:51,756 --> 01:15:53,908
Okay, there he is.
We're practically at the same place.

1294
01:15:53,909 --> 01:15:56,709
[Gil is merely 300m away.]

1295
01:15:56,710 --> 01:15:59,869
We know that he's around here,
so we just need to go find him.

1296
01:15:59,870 --> 01:16:03,782
[The chasers are closing in.]

1297
01:16:03,783 --> 01:16:07,817
[Gil is now on the run!]

1298
01:16:16,667 --> 01:16:18,833
[Extreme state of nervousness.]

1299
01:16:18,834 --> 01:16:20,753
Wow, I'm getting really nervous.

1300
01:16:22,545 --> 01:16:24,858
Where do you think I can hide?

1301
01:16:26,581 --> 01:16:29,138
I'm being chased right now.

1302
01:16:29,139 --> 01:16:31,012
[Gary's asking the employees for their help.]

1303
01:16:34,564 --> 01:16:36,473
How am I supposed to fit
myself in there?

1304
01:16:41,096 --> 01:16:42,508
Which way?

1305
01:16:45,792 --> 01:16:49,637
[Heading towards the corner that was
recommended to him...]

1306
01:16:54,563 --> 01:16:56,213
I can definitely hide in there.

1307
01:16:58,240 --> 01:17:01,589
[A remote place behind the walls.]

1308
01:17:06,615 --> 01:17:08,645
I'm going to hide right here.
Right here in the corner.

1309
01:17:10,005 --> 01:17:13,116
[No one's going to be able
to find me here.]

1310
01:17:13,579 --> 01:17:15,409
Gil just crossed the street.

1311
01:17:16,528 --> 01:17:19,004
The intersection.
I think he's at the intersection.

1312
01:17:20,837 --> 01:17:23,264
- Where?
- At that intersection. Let's run.

1313
01:17:23,265 --> 01:17:24,952
Here, put this on.

1314
01:17:26,180 --> 01:17:28,224
[Gil is paused in his tracks right then
to put something on.]

1315
01:17:28,225 --> 01:17:29,331
To the right.

1316
01:17:32,989 --> 01:17:34,198
Who's that over there?

1317
01:17:34,199 --> 01:17:36,195
[Gil is discovered!]

1318
01:17:37,937 --> 01:17:39,260
Isn't that Gil?

1319
01:17:39,947 --> 01:17:41,345
- That's Gil, isn't it?
- That's him.

1320
01:17:41,346 --> 01:17:42,723
- Gil!
- Gil!

1321
01:17:48,406 --> 01:17:49,853
- Gil!
- Hey, Gil!

1322
01:17:52,244 --> 01:17:55,435
[Save me, my swift feet!]

1323
01:17:59,845 --> 01:18:02,144
[Escapes into some building.]

1324
01:18:06,106 --> 01:18:08,104
[Huh?]

1325
01:18:09,954 --> 01:18:12,784
[Who is this guy in the wig?]

1326
01:18:14,039 --> 01:18:15,380
Hello?

1327
01:18:15,381 --> 01:18:19,172
[Leessang's in danger!]

1328
01:18:19,974 --> 01:18:24,140
[They're right across the road
from each other!]

1329
01:18:24,141 --> 01:18:26,196
I'm hiding up on the seventh floor.

1330
01:18:26,197 --> 01:18:27,703
Which floor is the final location on?

1331
01:18:27,704 --> 01:18:30,502
- First floor.
- First? I'll come up to the seventh first.

1332
01:18:31,295 --> 01:18:32,708
Okay, I got it.

1333
01:18:35,521 --> 01:18:39,945
[All three teams are now surrounding
the two buildings.]

1334
01:18:40,345 --> 01:18:42,277
Gil is inside this building somewhere.

1335
01:18:43,906 --> 01:18:49,612
[Just across the street...
is the final location.]

1336
01:18:53,318 --> 01:18:55,619
[Time to run.]

1337
01:18:57,410 --> 01:19:00,613
[But all the chasers are watching him
from across the street.]

1338
01:19:00,614 --> 01:19:04,464
[Gil is discovered.]

1339
01:19:05,123 --> 01:19:06,966
- Gil!
- We can see you!

1340
01:19:06,967 --> 01:19:10,226
- Where's Gary?
- Let's meet up and talk.

1341
01:19:12,138 --> 01:19:15,302
[Back on the run.]

1342
01:19:17,369 --> 01:19:20,291
[Gary is witnessing all the chaos
out the window.]

1343
01:19:22,143 --> 01:19:24,729
we're going to make a run for it
as soon as the light turns green.

1344
01:19:26,423 --> 01:19:28,474
Once I'm in the building,
I'm going up to the seventh floor.

1345
01:19:28,475 --> 01:19:30,411
[Up to the seventh floor
where Gary is waiting.]

1346
01:19:30,412 --> 01:19:33,578
[Gary is keeping an eye on what's
going on outside on the street.]

1347
01:19:33,579 --> 01:19:37,600
[And discovers Suk Jin and
Blank Ji out the window,]

1348
01:19:37,601 --> 01:19:39,397
I should send a text to Gil.

1349
01:19:39,982 --> 01:19:42,847
[Immediately texts Gil.]

1350
01:19:44,153 --> 01:19:48,504
<i>[Ji Hyo and Suk Jin are out by the gas station
so you'd better be careful.]</i>

1351
01:19:49,511 --> 01:19:52,586
Gary just texted me to let me know that
Suk Jin and Ji Hyo are waiting for me.

1352
01:19:54,032 --> 01:19:56,447
[Right behind him...]

1353
01:20:01,451 --> 01:20:04,817
[Gil really is running
all over the place today.]

1354
01:20:04,818 --> 01:20:07,355
What the heck is this?

1355
01:20:17,907 --> 01:20:20,741
[Yoo Hyuk shows up like the wind
out of nowhere!]

1356
01:20:22,847 --> 01:20:25,728
[Calling Gary to let him know what's going on
in case he's caught by Jae Suk.]

1357
01:20:26,424 --> 01:20:28,693
[The two on a dead run.]

1358
01:20:30,128 --> 01:20:34,221
[Will he be caught... or will he get away?]

1359
01:20:36,283 --> 01:20:38,818
[He's caught!]

1360
01:20:38,819 --> 01:20:40,228
Gary.

1361
01:20:43,208 --> 01:20:48,529
[Gil is trying to let Gary know
that he's been caught.]

1362
01:20:48,530 --> 01:20:50,977
[And quickly hangs up the phone
to prevent themselves from getting caught.]

1363
01:20:50,978 --> 01:20:53,024
[Have they been caught?]

1364
01:20:57,629 --> 01:21:00,542
[Jae Suk hands Gil over to Suk Jin.]

1365
01:21:01,055 --> 01:21:03,356
Seriously... seriously.

1366
01:21:03,357 --> 01:21:05,817
Gil... why are you doing this?

1367
01:21:08,250 --> 01:21:13,527
[He's not going to have any other choice but
to lead them to right where Gary is.]

1368
01:21:13,528 --> 01:21:15,694
[What do I do now?]

1369
01:21:15,695 --> 01:21:19,797
<i>I don't think that they know
you and I are in this together.</i>

1370
01:21:19,798 --> 01:21:23,949
[The members are still unaware of the fact
that they're in on this together.]

1371
01:21:23,950 --> 01:21:26,226
<i>I'm hiding up on the seventh floor right now.</i>

1372
01:21:26,227 --> 01:21:28,031
[Gary said he was hiding
up on the seventh floor...]

1373
01:21:28,032 --> 01:21:29,727
- We have to go to basement level seven.
- What? What doesn't exist.

1374
01:21:29,728 --> 01:21:31,784
That's where he is right now.

1375
01:21:32,073 --> 01:21:35,431
[Trying to lure them into the basement
storage where Gary had been in all day.]

1376
01:21:36,933 --> 01:21:41,795
[As long as Gary's well hidden...
we still may have a chance to win.]

1377
01:21:41,796 --> 01:21:43,211
So this is the place.

1378
01:21:43,212 --> 01:21:45,407
- Tell us where Gary is.
- Hang on a minute.

1379
01:21:46,993 --> 01:21:49,933
[Arrives on the basement level
where Gary was being held captive.]

1380
01:21:51,076 --> 01:21:52,756
- Gary!
- See the chair?

1381
01:21:52,757 --> 01:21:54,268
Gary!

1382
01:21:55,044 --> 01:21:57,412
- What is this?
- This is where he must've been held captive.

1383
01:21:57,413 --> 01:21:59,773
- Where did he go?
- That's where he must've been held.

1384
01:22:01,567 --> 01:22:03,731
[The members only discover an empty chair!]

1385
01:22:04,319 --> 01:22:06,758
- What is this?
- He must've escaped.

1386
01:22:07,570 --> 01:22:09,988
- He freed himself and escaped.
- Where did he go?

1387
01:22:11,764 --> 01:22:13,376
- Gary must've escaped.
- Gary!

1388
01:22:13,377 --> 01:22:15,048
- Gary!
- He escaped.

1389
01:22:15,634 --> 01:22:17,884
Do you see any clues?

1390
01:22:19,560 --> 01:22:24,910
[Stay in hiding... and let's meet up in front
of the platform when it's time.]

1391
01:22:24,911 --> 01:22:27,282
Do you think that the members will
figure out that it's all been staged?

1392
01:22:29,966 --> 01:22:31,970
What's going on here?

1393
01:22:31,971 --> 01:22:36,517
[Members with their suspicions...
and Gil continues to put on his act.]

1394
01:22:37,502 --> 01:22:43,614
[The clock is ticking...
and only 19 minutes left on the clock.]

1395
01:22:43,615 --> 01:22:47,606
- There's not much time.
- Who kidnapped Gary?

1396
01:22:48,220 --> 01:22:51,148
- I kidnapped him.
- You kidnapped him?

1397
01:22:53,781 --> 01:22:56,350
[Let's wait just a little bit longer...]

1398
01:22:58,113 --> 01:23:02,642
<i>[They're suspicious of us right now,
so stay well hidden.]</i>

1399
01:23:02,643 --> 01:23:04,782
- Where is he?
- What else do you know, Gil?

1400
01:23:05,429 --> 01:23:09,466
I'm sure that you know something.
Tell us everything you know.

1401
01:23:09,467 --> 01:23:11,391
[The members are trying to
get Gil to spill the beans.]

1402
01:23:11,392 --> 01:23:14,031
I'm sorry to say this, but we're going to
have to strip you if you don't tell us.

1403
01:23:15,886 --> 01:23:18,007
You could be hiding something.

1404
01:23:18,726 --> 01:23:21,673
The way I see it...
there's something here.

1405
01:23:23,770 --> 01:23:25,778
He's trying to distract us right now.

1406
01:23:25,779 --> 01:23:28,240
[Suspicious of Gil,
who won't leave the seventh floor.]

1407
01:23:29,991 --> 01:23:32,211
I can't believe how tough it is
to find Gary.

1408
01:23:32,212 --> 01:23:34,170
[Searching every nook and cranny.]

1409
01:23:38,269 --> 01:23:41,078
[The clock is ticking down...]

1410
01:23:50,751 --> 01:23:52,365
[Oh?]

1411
01:23:52,400 --> 01:23:54,550
[Isn't that?]

1412
01:23:55,741 --> 01:23:58,184
[That's where Gary is hiding!]

1413
01:24:01,837 --> 01:24:03,447
Gary!
There you are.

1414
01:24:04,363 --> 01:24:07,107
[Gary is discovered by Yoo Hyuk!]

1415
01:24:10,442 --> 01:24:12,576
Okay, I'll come out.
I'll come out right now.

1416
01:24:14,042 --> 01:24:16,200
[Let's stay calm...]

1417
01:24:16,201 --> 01:24:19,544
[It seems as though the members are still
unaware that everything's been staged.]

1418
01:24:19,545 --> 01:24:21,191
I'm here with Suk Jin right now.

1419
01:24:22,570 --> 01:24:24,855
[They still don't know my part in this...]

1420
01:24:26,072 --> 01:24:28,988
[Gary follows Jae Suk out to avoid
their suspicion.]

1421
01:24:31,019 --> 01:24:33,799
- I was held captive for like 10 hours.
- Where have you been all this time?

1422
01:24:34,562 --> 01:24:37,738
[Leessang wins as long as they can stand on
the platform once the door opens.]

1423
01:24:39,370 --> 01:24:42,288
[Disguising Gary so that the other teams
don't recognize who it is.]

1424
01:24:45,751 --> 01:24:48,058
[Yellow Team keeps Gil under watch.]

1425
01:24:49,995 --> 01:24:52,532
This is a violation of my personal privacy.

1426
01:24:55,463 --> 01:24:58,942
- Come on, Kwang Soo. That's too much.
- Stop it, Kwang Soo.

1427
01:24:58,943 --> 01:25:00,986
- He's texting Gary.
- Gary?

1428
01:25:02,318 --> 01:25:05,059
[No way anyone would be texting personal
messages during the filming of a show.]

1429
01:25:05,060 --> 01:25:08,196
How would you know?
I could be texting my mom.

1430
01:25:11,900 --> 01:25:16,575
<i>[Gil- I've been caught. Go wait by the cage.
Let's run in when it opens.]</i>

1431
01:25:16,576 --> 01:25:18,625
I was held captive all day long.

1432
01:25:18,626 --> 01:25:20,199
Gil tied me up in that chair.

1433
01:25:20,200 --> 01:25:23,243
- Where did he keep you hostage?
- How did you escape?

1434
01:25:23,244 --> 01:25:25,573
I used every ounce of strength I had
to get myself freed from the ropes.

1435
01:25:28,106 --> 01:25:30,341
[And they actually believe
what he's saying...]

1436
01:25:31,877 --> 01:25:34,357
[Less than six minutes left on the clock!]

1437
01:25:35,419 --> 01:25:36,769
Come here.

1438
01:25:39,744 --> 01:25:41,821
Do you know how much you had me
walk around this whole neighborhood?

1439
01:25:41,822 --> 01:25:45,040
[Got a full on tour of the
neighborhood all thanks to Gil.]

1440
01:25:48,333 --> 01:25:51,118
We even went to the police station, you liar.

1441
01:25:51,610 --> 01:25:53,849
Seriously though... where's Gary?

1442
01:25:53,850 --> 01:25:57,014
- Where is Gary right now?
- We could be missing something.

1443
01:25:57,015 --> 01:26:01,202
It's possible Gary and Gil might win if they
were to go on that platform together.

1444
01:26:02,078 --> 01:26:05,501
[That's our Ace Blank Ji!]

1445
01:26:05,502 --> 01:26:09,915
[Leessang's plan...
will they be able to succeed?]

1446
01:26:12,955 --> 01:26:17,640
- Why is he even on this show?
- He's been fooling us all day today.

1447
01:26:19,461 --> 01:26:22,677
We had to go see Jung Chi, Jung In...
and you have no idea what else we did.

1448
01:26:23,825 --> 01:26:25,525
- Even Choi Ja.
- What?

1449
01:26:25,526 --> 01:26:27,349
[Sorry, I asked him to come on the show.]

1450
01:26:28,609 --> 01:26:30,074
[Oh, Mr. Gary...
Your acting skills have improved!]

1451
01:26:30,075 --> 01:26:32,915
You have no idea how hard we worked
to find you.

1452
01:26:33,851 --> 01:26:36,443
[Jae Suk... just be
a little bit more patient with me...]

1453
01:26:37,301 --> 01:26:40,368
[One minute before their fate is decided!]

1454
01:26:40,606 --> 01:26:42,885
You kidnapped Gary?

1455
01:26:42,886 --> 01:26:46,206
You kidnapped him?
Then Gary didn't stage this whole thing?

1456
01:26:46,592 --> 01:26:49,075
[We need to hold out
just a little bit longer...]

1457
01:26:57,631 --> 01:27:04,109
[Which team will put an end to
this Christmas nightmare?]

1458
01:27:04,589 --> 01:27:05,971
Let's go.

1459
01:27:07,018 --> 01:27:09,524
- Wait, don't hold onto me anymore.
- Okay.

1460
01:27:11,799 --> 01:27:14,265
[The countdown!]

1461
01:27:17,253 --> 01:27:20,601
[The team that steps up onto the platform
when the gate open is the winner!]

1462
01:27:22,457 --> 01:27:25,887
[The door is finally opening!]

1463
01:27:25,888 --> 01:27:28,789
[The door will stay open for
only 10 minutes!]

1464
01:27:29,649 --> 01:27:32,437
[Blue Team rushing towards the door
with Gary in the middle!]

1465
01:27:33,423 --> 01:27:38,977
[Will Gary go on the platform with someone else,
or will Leessang stand together?]

1466
01:27:39,532 --> 01:27:42,239
[While all the other teams are fighting
amongst themselves...]

1467
01:27:42,240 --> 01:27:43,940
What is going on here all of a sudden?

1468
01:27:45,144 --> 01:27:47,706
[This is it, Gary...]

1469
01:27:48,935 --> 01:27:51,463
[It's now or never, Gil...]

1470
01:27:55,592 --> 01:27:59,926
[Leessang makes a run for it!]

1471
01:28:03,631 --> 01:28:06,859
[Why is Gary trying to step up on
the platform with Gil?]

1472
01:28:09,669 --> 01:28:13,224
[Can't be...]

1473
01:28:15,595 --> 01:28:19,521
[News of Gary's kidnapping
that came out of nowhere...]

1474
01:28:21,703 --> 01:28:25,226
[But it wasn't a kidnapping case...]

1475
01:28:29,493 --> 01:28:30,920
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

1476
01:28:31,898 --> 01:28:35,646
[This was all a part of Gary and Gil's plan.]

1477
01:28:36,950 --> 01:28:40,714
[It was a perfectly staged kidnapping!]

1478
01:28:40,715 --> 01:28:45,574
[This was all an act
planned by these two!]

1479
01:28:48,282 --> 01:28:50,252
[If Gil and Gary makes their stand,
then they win the race!]

1480
01:28:50,253 --> 01:28:52,718
It was all Leessang!
They're going to win this!

1481
01:28:53,979 --> 01:28:58,931
[Others must drag Gil off the platform
to stand on there with Gary!]

1482
01:29:00,147 --> 01:29:02,398
[Just then!]

1483
01:29:02,399 --> 01:29:05,338
[Gary and Gil's feet!]

1484
01:29:06,590 --> 01:29:08,925
[They both have to be standing there together
to be declared the winners!]

1485
01:29:16,048 --> 01:29:18,624
[Did they succeed?]

1486
01:29:24,227 --> 01:29:27,835
[Leessang's plan is a success!]

1487
01:29:27,836 --> 01:29:31,187
- See? I told you.
- These two planned everything.

1488
01:29:33,677 --> 01:29:35,646
Come on, be happy for me.

1489
01:29:39,176 --> 01:29:41,934
[Gil has been crucial in fooling
all the members into falling for their plan.]

1490
01:29:42,780 --> 01:29:46,114
[All seven gold prizes!]

1491
01:29:46,115 --> 01:29:48,107
We're the ones that found Gary.

1492
01:29:49,674 --> 01:29:52,809
[Is it another Gary Christmas?]

1493
01:29:53,547 --> 01:29:56,713
- Gary always wins the Christmas special.
- We were playing defense today.

1494
01:29:58,639 --> 01:30:02,086
<i>[Thank you to Gaeko, Choi Ja, Jung Chi,
Jung In and A-Pink for helping me out- Gary.]</i>

1495
01:30:02,904 --> 01:30:04,675
<i>[Have a very Gary Christmas!]</i>
