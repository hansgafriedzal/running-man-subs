47
00:03:09,735 --> 00:03:11,318
She's not that young.

48

87
00:05:34,491 --> 00:05:36,470
- Come take a seat.

[Yoo Jae Suk's new year fortune.]

94
00:05:58,474 --> 00:06:02,097
- The energy that you've been born with...
- Yes?

95
00:06:02,098 --> 00:06:04,776
Of the five elements, you've
been born with the energy of 'Geum'.

96
00:06:04,777 --> 00:06:07,863
- Geum?
- Doesn't that mean, 'knowledge'?

97
00:06:07,864 --> 00:06:09,575
Geum?

98
00:06:09,946 --> 00:06:12,460
I can't be home on Fridays.
('Geum-yo-il= Friday')

99
00:06:12,461 --> 00:06:16,753
You have a strong drive, and an iron will.

100
00:06:16,754 --> 00:06:20,425
And there's also an
instinctive chivalry within you as well.

101
00:06:20,635 --> 00:06:24,945
[Chivalrous Jae Suk.]

102
00:06:24,946 --> 00:06:27,262
But he does have a bit of a temper.

103
00:06:27,263 --> 00:06:29,549
Yes, he does have a bit of that.

104
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:33,433
People with a higher outlook,
or view in life...

105
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:39,168
they tend to be looked upon as
natural leaders of others.

106
00:06:39,998 --> 00:06:42,917
I see those characteristics of you
in your fortune.

107
00:06:43,261 --> 00:06:47,865
And when I look at your life line,
between the ages of 34 and 40...

108
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:54,756
those seven years of life are a time for you to
earn great honor and reputation for yourself.

109
00:06:54,757 --> 00:06:56,529
<i>Then will his life decline after that?

110
00:07:00,548 --> 00:07:03,420
- How could you say such a thing?
- His decline will mean our own decline.

111
00:07:05,122 --> 00:07:07,440
- You're trying to steal his limelight.
- Stop saying things like that.

112
00:07:07,441 --> 00:07:12,137
The years between the ages of
34 and 40...

113
00:07:12,138 --> 00:07:16,856
even though you may have built a great
reputation for yourself...

114
00:07:16,857 --> 00:07:24,030
you may also find some problems arise
that can try to shake up your success.

115
00:07:24,204 --> 00:07:26,779
- But that's already in the past.
- That's already past?

116
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:29,555
So that dangerous pitfall in your life is
already in the past.

117
00:07:29,556 --> 00:07:31,702
What I can say to you about
your fortune is

118
00:07:31,703 --> 00:07:37,933
you've been born with a very strong,
and solid fortune in your life...

119
00:07:38,498 --> 00:07:42,892
Just like how a large ship cannot be
destroyed by a small wave.

120
00:07:42,893 --> 00:07:47,214
You have the fortune to withstand and
endure most hardships you'll come across.

121
00:07:47,215 --> 00:07:50,608
You won't be easily ruined or destroyed.
Fortune that you've been born with...

122
00:07:50,609 --> 00:07:53,103
You've been born with luck in
both women and money.

123
00:07:53,104 --> 00:07:55,272
From what I've seen,
he doesn't have any luck with women.

124
00:07:58,307 --> 00:08:01,071
Can't you stay quiet?
He's reading my fortune right now.

125
00:08:01,072 --> 00:08:02,969
He has his wife, whom he's
very lucky to have found.

126
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:05,171
Since you've been born with
luck in women and money...

127
00:08:05,172 --> 00:08:11,693
you will always find yourself lucky in both
of those categories for the rest of your life.

128
00:08:11,694 --> 00:08:14,525
And even your fortune for the new year
seems very strong and solid.

129
00:08:14,526 --> 00:08:18,140
So you'll find that you'll be successful
no matter what you decide to get involved in.

130
00:08:18,141 --> 00:08:20,416
- So just keep on doing what you're doing.
- Okay.

131
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:23,860
Don't get involved in any joint ventures
until you reach the age of 45.

132
00:08:24,099 --> 00:08:27,091
He keeps wanting me to
start something with him.

133
00:08:27,092 --> 00:08:30,884
- You heard what he said, didn't you?
- Then we'll start after you turn 45.

134
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:36,951
It would be wise for you to avoid getting
yourself involved in any joint ventures.

135
00:08:37,274 --> 00:08:41,163
That's how your fortune reads.
And as for your fortune for the next year...

136
00:08:41,164 --> 00:08:45,294
[Jae Suk's fortune for 2014.]

137
00:08:45,295 --> 00:08:50,256
If you're planning on expanding your family,
I see that this is the year for it to happen.

138
00:08:50,257 --> 00:08:52,850
[This is the year for him
to expand his family.]

139
00:08:52,851 --> 00:08:55,564
[Will this be the year for your second baby?]

140
00:08:55,565 --> 00:08:58,849
- You see that happening this year?
- Yes, I see that happening this year.

141
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:06,205
You also show prosperity in offspring,
so the more you have, the better you'll be.

142
00:09:06,206 --> 00:09:09,234
[Prosperity in children-
More he has, better off he'll be.]

143
00:09:09,235 --> 00:09:12,395
I'll work hard to have as many children
as I possibly can.

144
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:14,277
As for your lucky sign for the new year

145
00:09:14,278 --> 00:09:18,762
I see that the best sign for you this year
is the Dragon, Dog, Sheep, and Bull.

146
00:09:18,763 --> 00:09:21,532
- I'm a Dog.
- I'm the Bull. We have to stick together.

147
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:23,157
[Dragon and the Bull.]

148
00:09:23,158 --> 00:09:25,151
[And Gary is... 'Gae'?]
(Gae=Dog.)

149
00:09:29,788 --> 00:09:30,850
Thank you, Sir.

150
00:09:30,885 --> 00:09:33,312
[The end of Jae Suk's fortune telling.]

151
00:09:34,796 --> 00:09:38,345
[Next up is, Moon So Ri.
What will her fortune say?]

152
00:09:38,696 --> 00:09:40,992
[Moon So Ri's new year fortune.]

153
00:09:43,059 --> 00:09:46,094
Look at me.
Look at me straight in the face.

154
00:09:46,095 --> 00:09:48,971
[Innocent So Ri seems to be nervous
about having her fortune read.]

155
00:09:48,972 --> 00:09:50,889
I had no idea that he'd read
so deep into my fortune.

156
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:53,469
As for Moon So Ri...

157
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:55,511
When you were born...

158
00:09:55,512 --> 00:10:01,465
you were born with a very strong
energy surrounding you.

159
00:10:01,761 --> 00:10:05,329
The energy that's surrounding you
is very strong, but it's not bad energy.

160
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:10,817
You were born with a very
auspicious energy surrounding you.

161
00:10:11,479 --> 00:10:14,009
For example, I see that
you're a very eloquent speaker.

162
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:19,614
You have the ability to make others melt
with the words that you speak.

163
00:10:20,018 --> 00:10:22,803
- So I make others melt?
- Yes, you do.

164
00:10:22,838 --> 00:10:27,227
- And also... there's nobility about you.
- Nobility?

165
00:10:30,707 --> 00:10:33,238
[Seems to be very happy to hear
her fortune.]

166
00:10:33,239 --> 00:10:35,782
Yes, this is making me very
happy to hear it.

167
00:10:35,783 --> 00:10:37,508
Yes, this is all true.

168
00:10:37,509 --> 00:10:41,116
I can also see that there's something
that you're not very happy about right now.

169
00:10:41,117 --> 00:10:42,856
If you're unhappy about something,
you have to let it out.

170
00:10:42,857 --> 00:10:45,828
You have the tendency to bottle
all your worries and unhappiness inside.

171
00:10:46,616 --> 00:10:48,881
If you do that,
you'll suffer from emotional distress.

172
00:10:48,882 --> 00:10:52,476
Yes, I have suffered from bouts of
emotional distress ever since I was little.

173
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:55,419
You've been suffering from emotional distress
since you were little?

174
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:58,272
I've always suffered from congenital
emotional distress syndrome.

175
00:10:58,273 --> 00:11:01,697
If you're ever unhappy about something,
you have to let it all out.

176
00:11:01,698 --> 00:11:04,805
Keeping it all bottled up inside
is not good for you.

177
00:11:04,806 --> 00:11:07,878
I wish I could do that too.

178
00:11:07,879 --> 00:11:10,077
- I'll try my best to do that.
- You have to do that.

179
00:11:10,488 --> 00:11:13,491
If I look back at the life
that you've led...

180
00:11:14,571 --> 00:11:16,668
I see that you've had to deal with
a lot of various different situations.

181
00:11:16,669 --> 00:11:22,561
Those situations that you've been dealing with
will peak between the ages of 33 and 41.

182
00:11:22,562 --> 00:11:26,507
Those nine years...
will be extremely difficult.

183
00:11:26,508 --> 00:11:29,348
Will be extremely difficult.

184
00:11:29,349 --> 00:11:32,629
[Difficult...]

185
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:35,716
Your fortune in general isn't bad,
but there are good and bad parts about it.

186
00:11:35,717 --> 00:11:39,185
<i>Your fortune in general isn't bad,
but there are good and bad parts about it.

187
00:11:39,186 --> 00:11:43,438
- Even though you've had some changes...
- I feel like I'm going to cry.

188
00:11:47,326 --> 00:11:49,708
Let it all out!
Don't bottle it up inside!

189
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:51,952
She really must be dealing with some stuff.

190
00:11:51,953 --> 00:11:55,229
[Having had to deal with many twists
and turns in her life...]

191
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:58,298
- But this winter will be the last of it.
- It's all over then?

192
00:11:58,299 --> 00:12:01,099
No, this year will be the last.
You just have to endure it for another year.

193
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:04,035
One more year of suffering,
and it'll all be over.

194
00:12:04,036 --> 00:12:07,750
[Words that truly bring comfort to her heart
which has been suffering for so many years.]

195
00:12:09,038 --> 00:12:11,764
- So Ri is really...
- Please don't cry.

196
00:12:11,765 --> 00:12:13,372
This is a variety show.

197
00:12:17,747 --> 00:12:21,199
- I really didn't mean to...
- I don't know what her situation may be...

198
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,920
- She must be dealing with some stuff.
- Yes, I think you're right.

199
00:12:23,254 --> 00:12:26,925
This may make it seem like my life is
very difficult, but that's not the case.

200
00:12:26,926 --> 00:12:28,741
- I really am happy.
- Yes, I hope so.

201
00:12:29,054 --> 00:12:31,959
[Yes, we know.]

202
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,275
I really am happy with my wonderful husband,
and our beautiful baby together.

203
00:12:35,165 --> 00:12:39,601
But the difficulties that I see
are not apparent in your face.

204
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:42,965
I only see it in your fortune.

205
00:12:44,131 --> 00:12:47,353
That's why once you get through
this year...

206
00:12:47,354 --> 00:12:52,327
I see that you'll be rid of the heavy burden
that you've had to carry all these years.

207
00:12:52,328 --> 00:12:56,528
So rest your worries.
The biggest attribute I see in your fortune...

208
00:12:56,529 --> 00:12:58,291
is your husband.

209
00:12:58,292 --> 00:13:01,427
You just need to follow your husband's lead
and do as he says.

210
00:13:01,428 --> 00:13:04,013
If you do,
you'll be gifted with much happiness.

211
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:07,512
I bet her husband will be very happy
to hear this when he watches the show.

212
00:13:07,513 --> 00:13:10,944
I bet he'll be sitting on the couch
slapping his knees in agreement.

213
00:13:15,489 --> 00:13:17,405
I'll be very good to my husband.

214
00:13:17,957 --> 00:13:21,919
[Wishing you two a lifetime of happiness.]

215
00:13:23,529 --> 00:13:25,550
[What will Suk Jin's fortune
for the new year say?]

216
00:13:25,551 --> 00:13:29,291
[Ji Suk Jin's new year fortune.]

217
00:13:29,292 --> 00:13:31,325
He really loves investing his money.

218
00:13:31,326 --> 00:13:33,641
His history in money investing
truly is turbulent.

219
00:13:33,642 --> 00:13:35,307
- No crying, okay?
- Okay.

220
00:13:35,637 --> 00:13:37,573
Can someone hand us a box of tissue?

221
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:39,857
- Ji Suk Jin.
- Yes.

222
00:13:41,418 --> 00:13:44,187
- You've been very lucky with your wife.
- My wife?

223
00:13:44,188 --> 00:13:47,128
Yes, his wife is really wealthy.

224
00:13:48,919 --> 00:13:51,873
- His wife is really wealthy.
- Why are you even mentioning that?

225
00:13:52,933 --> 00:13:55,220
So his wife is wealthier than him?

226
00:13:55,702 --> 00:13:58,275
- You're lucky with women.
- Yes, I think you're right.

227
00:13:58,276 --> 00:14:01,351
- Your wife is full of wisdom.
- Yes, that's very true.

228
00:14:03,061 --> 00:14:06,545
Don't let your eyes stray elsewhere.

229
00:14:11,234 --> 00:14:16,202
[Warns him to always keep his eyes
focused on his wife only.]

230
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:21,313
My focus is on my family,
and my family only.

231
00:14:22,225 --> 00:14:24,017
Since your fortune shows that
you have a lot of luck with women

232
00:14:24,018 --> 00:14:27,086
it's very possible that you have female
friends, even though you may not date them.

233
00:14:27,087 --> 00:14:29,562
[Hm?]

234
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:34,623
[His fortune shows that he has
a lot of 'female friends'.]

235
00:14:36,646 --> 00:14:38,915
[That's not what I meant.]

236
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:44,200
- I don't mean relationship-wise.
- Ah, friends?

237
00:14:44,201 --> 00:14:47,769
People of the opposite sex can be friends.

238
00:14:48,016 --> 00:14:51,675
I'm saying that if you have a lot of women
in your life as friends...

239
00:14:51,676 --> 00:14:53,241
they will become of help to you in your life.

240
00:14:53,242 --> 00:14:55,341
So I'm saying that you should have
those women in your life as friends.

241
00:14:55,341 --> 00:14:58,159
[Meaning that the female friends that he has
in his life will be a positive addition.]

242
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,626
- So I need to keep them around?
- That's not exactly what I'm saying.

243
00:15:00,627 --> 00:15:03,552
I'm just saying that they'll naturally
come into your life.

244
00:15:03,553 --> 00:15:06,793
That's the kind of luck I see you'll have
with women in your life.

245
00:15:06,794 --> 00:15:08,043
And also...

246
00:15:08,044 --> 00:15:12,458
When I take a look at your fortune
for the year 2014...

247
00:15:12,927 --> 00:15:18,627
I see that you could be mistaken into
thinking that this could be your year.

248
00:15:19,617 --> 00:15:23,773
[A deep misunderstanding...]

249
00:15:25,579 --> 00:15:28,237
He has a way with his words.

250
00:15:32,197 --> 00:15:33,787
Let's just aim for next year, Suk Jin.

251
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:37,200
- Thank you.
- Why are you trying to end it already?

252
00:15:38,217 --> 00:15:41,117
Your reading isn't over yet!
Just stay seated exactly where you are.

253
00:15:41,118 --> 00:15:42,695
I already heard my fortune.

254
00:15:42,696 --> 00:15:43,777
Thank you, sir.

255
00:15:43,778 --> 00:15:46,982
[I love you, my sweet wife.]

256
00:15:47,523 --> 00:15:49,762
[What will Sexy Queen,
Jung Hwa's fortune say?]

257
00:15:50,415 --> 00:15:54,033
[Uhm Jung Hwa's new year fortune.]

258
00:15:54,034 --> 00:15:56,551
- Uhm Jung Hwa.
- I'm so nervous.

259
00:15:56,552 --> 00:15:59,981
Uhm Jung Hwa... you're a born worker.

260
00:15:59,982 --> 00:16:01,106
[A born worker.]

261
00:16:01,107 --> 00:16:04,086
[Darn!]

262
00:16:08,066 --> 00:16:09,981
That's what she said
she was most afraid to hear.

263
00:16:09,982 --> 00:16:12,121
Moon So Ri was told that she was
born with nobility in her.

264
00:16:13,598 --> 00:16:16,455
[Jung Hwa- Born worker.
So Ri- Born nobility.]

265
00:16:18,764 --> 00:16:21,830
First of all, whether you like it or not,
you're always surrounded by work.

266
00:16:21,831 --> 00:16:25,261
If I were to take a look
at your relationship aspect...

267
00:16:25,262 --> 00:16:26,596
[And the most important part...]

268
00:16:26,597 --> 00:16:29,365
[Love and relationship aspect.]

269
00:16:29,635 --> 00:16:31,859
- That's very important.
- That's what she wants to hear the most.

270
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:33,748
I really hope that it's a good fortune.

271
00:16:33,749 --> 00:16:36,902
[The younger spectators are feeling
the desperation even more than she is.]

272
00:16:37,414 --> 00:16:40,978
I see that there are always a lot of
love and relationship prospects around you.

273
00:16:41,541 --> 00:16:48,113
Around ages 40 and 45...
I see your desire to have children.

274
00:16:48,566 --> 00:16:54,906
The desire in you to have children...
has already passed.

275
00:16:54,907 --> 00:16:56,906
[Her desire to have children
has already passed?]

276
00:16:56,907 --> 00:16:58,728
It's already passed?

277
00:17:00,248 --> 00:17:04,348
[Since you're such a
young-hearted Sexy Queen...]

278
00:17:05,379 --> 00:17:08,116
- Please take another look!
- It's already passed?

279
00:17:08,117 --> 00:17:09,807
I really love babies lately.

280
00:17:09,808 --> 00:17:11,838
Any relationship that comes into your life
from this moment on

281
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:14,209
you need to be very clear
about where you stand with those.

282
00:17:14,209 --> 00:17:19,464
[She herself needs to be very clear about what
she wants if she wants to get married.]

283
00:17:19,783 --> 00:17:24,277
- Your wealth isn't in the movies.
- Why not in the movies?

284
00:17:24,755 --> 00:17:28,969
- You're being so greedy.
- You're plenty successful as is!

285
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:34,410
Your fortune states that you yourself
are responsible for your own wealth.

286
00:17:34,411 --> 00:17:37,176
Your career in movies will be successful
when you meet the right man.

287
00:17:37,177 --> 00:17:40,317
[Wealth will be up to her own abilities, and
the right man will bring success with movies.]

288
00:17:40,318 --> 00:17:43,501
So if you want to live your life
like those that you see in the movies

289
00:17:43,502 --> 00:17:47,621
you will have to meet
your husband in the near future.

290
00:17:47,622 --> 00:17:49,306
But I don't have anyone.

291
00:17:49,307 --> 00:17:52,315
- What are you talking about?
- You have one right here.

292
00:17:54,858 --> 00:17:58,038
[Jung Hwa's man of destiny... is Kkuk?]

293
00:17:58,039 --> 00:17:59,926
If you two get together,
your lives will be like a movie.

294
00:18:01,637 --> 00:18:03,799
[The truth is...
Jong Kook's fortune earlier...]

295
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:07,242
You need to meet a woman
with bigger eyes.

296
00:18:07,793 --> 00:18:10,389
- Woman with big eyes?
- Yes.

297
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:14,600
Meeting a woman with a big set of eyes
will be a great match for you.

298
00:18:14,601 --> 00:18:16,253
<i>It's because your eyes are too small.

299
00:18:17,242 --> 00:18:19,796
Woman who's eyes are as big as a Shih Tzu?

300
00:18:21,072 --> 00:18:23,830
- Why are you using a Shih Tzu as comparison?
- Shih Tzu's have big eyes.

301
00:18:23,831 --> 00:18:28,016
[Or the cartoon character, Candy?]

302
00:18:28,017 --> 00:18:30,118
That's right.
I have big eyes!

303
00:18:30,119 --> 00:18:33,447
[Jung Hwa and Kkuk seems to be
the ideal match.]

304
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:36,218
- Also...
- I'm not going to lose him.

305
00:18:36,219 --> 00:18:41,887
As for the sign of your ideal match, he
needs to be either a Dragon, Horse, Sheep...

306
00:18:41,888 --> 00:18:43,299
He's the Dragon sign!

307
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:45,583
[Kkuk is the sign of the Dragon!]

308
00:18:45,584 --> 00:18:47,192
You're the sign of the dragon?

309
00:18:47,193 --> 00:18:50,791
[A match made in heaven.]

310
00:18:50,792 --> 00:18:57,068
Since they are your ideal match,
if you meet anyone of any of those signs...

311
00:18:57,069 --> 00:18:59,323
- You need to take a closer look at them.
- Okay.

312
00:18:59,324 --> 00:19:02,775
Your fortune for the new year
looks pretty good overall.

313
00:19:02,776 --> 00:19:05,737
[We hope that you meet
your match in the new year!]

314
00:19:07,243 --> 00:19:09,995
[And lastly, it's Kwang Soo's turn.
His first time getting his fortune told.]

315
00:19:09,996 --> 00:19:15,098
[The members' fortune telling time.
A meaningful correlation to today's race!]

316
00:19:15,099 --> 00:19:18,318
[Lee Kwang Soo's new year fortune.]

317
00:19:18,319 --> 00:19:22,623
When I take a look at your fortune...

318
00:19:22,624 --> 00:19:26,570
I see that you're a very generous
and tolerant person.

319
00:19:26,571 --> 00:19:29,448
And you are a man of beauty and grace.

320
00:19:29,449 --> 00:19:31,200
[A man of beauty and grace?]

321
00:19:31,201 --> 00:19:35,553
You are as sturdy as a tree.

322
00:19:35,554 --> 00:19:37,378
Look at how long and elongated you are.

323
00:19:37,379 --> 00:19:39,261
Look at how long and elongated you are.

324
00:19:39,734 --> 00:19:41,710
[Loooong.]

325
00:19:43,726 --> 00:19:46,192
- Is that a good thing?
- That means that you're very generous.

326
00:19:46,492 --> 00:19:50,147
Many scholars have a similar physique.

327
00:19:50,148 --> 00:19:54,554
People who have similar statures
are usually scholars.

328
00:19:54,555 --> 00:19:57,105
You show a very good characteristic.

329
00:19:57,106 --> 00:20:00,565
[Kwang Soo is known for his kind,
and good natured personality.]

330
00:20:00,566 --> 00:20:02,568
- Many people are jealous of you.
- All these guys are jealous of me!

331
00:20:02,569 --> 00:20:06,117
- It's so frustrating!
- Some may say that you're nerdy.

332
00:20:06,118 --> 00:20:08,493
Some may say that you're nerdy.

333
00:20:08,995 --> 00:20:11,553
What do you mean, I'm nerdy?

334
00:20:11,554 --> 00:20:13,614
No, I'm not nerdy!

335
00:20:13,615 --> 00:20:15,458
Yes, I'm sure he's heard that before.

336
00:20:15,826 --> 00:20:19,085
What I mean is, you may be called that,
but that's not the truth.

337
00:20:19,086 --> 00:20:20,373
That's not the truth at all.

338
00:20:20,635 --> 00:20:23,032
- You don't have a fickle personality.
- That's very true about him.

339
00:20:23,033 --> 00:20:26,719
No matter what may be going on around you,
you're not prone to changes.

340
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:30,124
- You're very true to yourself.
- Yes, he never ceases to betray.

341
00:20:30,475 --> 00:20:33,908
You just need to keep being that way.
Another thing is...

342
00:20:33,909 --> 00:20:37,150
Your character shows a strong
sense and ability for regrowth.

343
00:20:37,587 --> 00:20:40,549
- New business ventures are in your future.
- Business ventures?

344
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:41,885
Let's start a business together.

345
00:20:41,886 --> 00:20:44,521
Then he should stop being in the
entertainment industry and go for business?

346
00:20:44,522 --> 00:20:46,331
That's a whole separate issue.

347
00:20:46,332 --> 00:20:48,834
- He said, go for business.
- That's a separate issue.

348
00:20:48,835 --> 00:20:51,131
What I'm saying is...

349
00:20:51,132 --> 00:20:55,147
You need to wait until you're at least
36 years old before you start any business.

350
00:20:55,148 --> 00:20:58,055
Right now isn't the time.
You'll be completely ruined if you do it now.

351
00:20:58,056 --> 00:21:02,316
[It seems as though starting a business now
is the worst thing that he could do.]

352
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:08,411
[They have selective hearing with
only the words that they want to hear.]

353
00:21:10,197 --> 00:21:13,034
- Please listen carefully. I'm trying to help.
- Yes, I understand.

354
00:21:13,035 --> 00:21:18,070
So just keep doing what you're doing
until you reach the age of 35.

355
00:21:18,071 --> 00:21:22,922
Don't deviate from what you're doing now,
and just keep doing the work you're doing now.

356
00:21:22,923 --> 00:21:28,076
Once you reach the age of 35,
things will change, do what you want then.

357
00:21:28,077 --> 00:21:30,509
You can do your business ventures then.
Just wait until then.

358
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:33,741
Things that are related to your current
job industry will be fine.

359
00:21:33,742 --> 00:21:37,482
You could say that doing something in that
field would be the best option for you.

360
00:21:37,483 --> 00:21:40,068
You're saying that this is the best
he'll get, right?

361
00:21:40,069 --> 00:21:42,808
[He wants to go even higher in his field...]

362
00:21:42,809 --> 00:21:44,978
- So this is the best he can do?
- Not any higher than where he is now.

363
00:21:45,271 --> 00:21:48,595
Then of all the fortunes that you've read,
who has the best fortune of all of us?

364
00:21:48,596 --> 00:21:50,439
[Who has the best fortune
out of the group?]

365
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:52,925
- Jae Suk?
- Yes, Yoo Jae Suk.

366
00:21:52,926 --> 00:21:57,497
He's been born with such good fortune.

367
00:21:57,498 --> 00:21:59,361
- Just as I thought.
- That's such a relief.

368
00:21:59,362 --> 00:22:01,309
That's a relief for all of us.

369
00:22:02,241 --> 00:22:05,863
Why are you relieved to hear about my fortune?
You each have your own fortunes.

370
00:22:05,864 --> 00:22:08,681
- You have your own fortunes.
- Your fortune is important to all of us.

371
00:22:09,837 --> 00:22:12,322
That's the best thing we've heard all day.

372
00:22:12,323 --> 00:22:14,436
His success means our own success.

373
00:22:14,437 --> 00:22:16,658
Then we can feel reassured for our own
future for the rest of the year.

374
00:22:16,659 --> 00:22:19,234
- We're all set!
- Thank you, sir.

375
00:22:20,113 --> 00:22:22,474
As you've been told before,
you all listened carefully to your fortunes?

376
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:28,671
I will now explain today's race which is
directly correlated to the fortune telling.

377
00:22:28,672 --> 00:22:30,286
First...

378
00:22:31,208 --> 00:22:32,882
- You're giving us something?
- We all get something?

379
00:22:33,055 --> 00:22:36,258
[They're all handed something...]

380
00:22:36,259 --> 00:22:40,324
[A gold ring?]

381
00:22:42,276 --> 00:22:44,752
Why do I have to wear
a couple ring with Suk Jin?

382
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:49,457
Your work never ends, Jung Hwa.
You've been told that you're a worker.

383
00:22:49,458 --> 00:22:52,188
- A natural born worker.
- I'm a worker.

384
00:22:52,996 --> 00:22:54,657
Today's race is...

385
00:22:55,668 --> 00:22:57,721
It's a Partner of Destiny Special.

386
00:22:58,830 --> 00:23:01,670
With the fortune that you all
got to hear about yourselves...

387
00:23:01,671 --> 00:23:05,422
We have had the compatibility fortune read
of all our members and our guest members.

388
00:23:05,423 --> 00:23:08,263
[They have been partnered up with the people
whom their fortune is most compatible with?]

389
00:23:08,264 --> 00:23:13,402
[Find the person whom you're
most compatible with!]

390
00:23:14,207 --> 00:23:16,530
That means that there's a couple amongst us
who are more compatible than anyone else.

391
00:23:16,531 --> 00:23:18,603
Then it would be two males as well?

392
00:23:18,604 --> 00:23:20,910
[It could be a couple of the same sex.]

393
00:23:20,911 --> 00:23:23,680
Then that means it's going to be
Jong Kook and Jung Hwa like the fortune said.

394
00:23:26,284 --> 00:23:28,176
I'm told that there's
wealth within me, Jong Kook.

395
00:23:28,177 --> 00:23:31,942
So here's your mission for the day.

396
00:23:31,943 --> 00:23:35,042
Guess who each member is most compatible
with to create five sets of couples.

397
00:23:35,043 --> 00:23:37,995
[Guess the five couples who's fortune and
destiny are most compatible.]

398
00:23:37,996 --> 00:23:42,312
[Board the train of destiny
and succeed the mission as a group.]

399
00:23:42,313 --> 00:23:46,724
[They'll be given a hint as to who the
couples are whenever they succeed a mission.]

400
00:23:46,725 --> 00:23:51,724
You must guess all five couples correctly
once you arrive at the final destination

401
00:23:51,725 --> 00:23:53,562
in order for you to succeed the mission.

402
00:23:53,563 --> 00:23:55,928
[Must guess all five couple correctly
in order to succeed the mission!]

403
00:23:55,929 --> 00:23:58,667
- We have to correctly guess all the couples.
- I wonder who my destined partner is?

404
00:23:58,668 --> 00:24:01,684
[Just who could be my own partner
of destiny?]

405
00:24:01,955 --> 00:24:05,522
If you can correctly guess all the couples,
then you get to keep your gold rings.

406
00:24:05,523 --> 00:24:06,955
Ah... we have to guess them all correctly?

407
00:24:06,956 --> 00:24:10,288
You will have to return the ring if you get
even a single couple wrong.

408
00:24:10,289 --> 00:24:12,329
[Must return the ring
if their guess is incorrect.]

409
00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:15,012
In order to see how compatible you are
with others in the group

410
00:24:15,013 --> 00:24:17,911
you'll be given a chance to swap your
partners with each mission.

411
00:24:17,912 --> 00:24:20,342
- Really?
- Then we're all doing this as a team.

412
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:25,094
[A match made in heaven race.]

413
00:24:25,095 --> 00:24:27,680
Then let's all work well together so that
we can all succeed together in the end.

414
00:24:27,681 --> 00:24:30,150
[For the gold ring!]

415
00:24:30,151 --> 00:24:31,555
I'll bring home the gold, Honey!

416
00:24:37,908 --> 00:24:41,003
- It's been a while since we took the train.
- It really has been a while.

417
00:24:41,004 --> 00:24:43,772
But... where are we going
on this train?

418
00:24:49,553 --> 00:24:55,343
[A romantic train ride
on this snowy winter day.]

419
00:24:56,726 --> 00:24:59,663
Train station on a snowy day...
It's really romantic.

420
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:02,459
- But it's so cold.
- It really is cold.

421
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:05,277
- It's romantic, but it's still cold.
- It really is cold.

422
00:25:05,278 --> 00:25:07,410
I'm so cold!

423
00:25:08,988 --> 00:25:13,605
[Nine minutes left until their departure.]

424
00:25:13,606 --> 00:25:17,043
Don't you think that we should go and
get some snacks for the train ride?

425
00:25:17,044 --> 00:25:19,267
- Should we go get some snacks?
- Yes, let's go.

426
00:25:19,268 --> 00:25:21,743
- Can we go get some hamburgers?
- Let's do it by team.

427
00:25:21,744 --> 00:25:24,580
- Okay, let's do it by teams.
- And you have to pay with your own money.

428
00:25:24,581 --> 00:25:26,180
- We'll do it in teams.
- I don't have any money on me.

429
00:25:26,181 --> 00:25:29,122
You have to figure that out for yourself.
Borrow the money if you have to.

430
00:25:29,123 --> 00:25:31,576
- Someone from each team needs to step up.
- I'm not good at Rock-Paper-Scissors.

431
00:25:31,577 --> 00:25:34,636
- You're not good? Then step up.
- What are you doing?

432
00:25:34,637 --> 00:25:37,259
- That's why we want you to play.
- If you're not good at it, then step up.

433
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:39,137
Rock-Paper-Scissors.

434
00:25:39,519 --> 00:25:40,939
Rock-Paper-Scissors.

435
00:25:41,162 --> 00:25:43,186
[Ji Hyo, Jung Hwa, and Min Soo win!]

436
00:25:44,483 --> 00:25:46,412
- It's not us!
- I thought you had good luck!

437
00:25:46,413 --> 00:25:48,141
We still have a chance.
Don't worry about it.

438
00:25:48,142 --> 00:25:50,549
[Jae Suk and So Ri vs.
Suk Jin and Kwang Soo.]

439
00:25:51,701 --> 00:25:55,580
[Jae Suk and So Ri to go buy the snacks.]

440
00:25:55,581 --> 00:25:58,865
[Eight minutes left until their departure.
Not much time left, so they must hurry!]

441
00:25:58,866 --> 00:26:01,789
- Hamburger!
- And french fries too!

442
00:26:01,963 --> 00:26:05,157
[They all want different things!
Shouting out their orders.]

443
00:26:05,158 --> 00:26:09,400
- So Ri... you should have done it.
- I don't even eat hamburgers.

444
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:10,703
- Now I have to get burgers?
- Really? You don't eat them?

445
00:26:11,805 --> 00:26:13,970
What time is our flight, did you say?

446
00:26:14,554 --> 00:26:17,580
- Don't act bashful.
- What time did you say was our train?

447
00:26:17,625 --> 00:26:19,438
- What time?
- It's been delayed by three minutes.

448
00:26:19,439 --> 00:26:22,897
[The snow delays the train by three minutes.
This delay will soon cause a shocking event.]

449
00:26:23,312 --> 00:26:27,463
[Jae Suk and So Ri are at a hotdog stand
inside the train station.]

450
00:26:28,373 --> 00:26:30,186
- Are you okay with Americano?
- Yes.

451
00:26:31,062 --> 00:26:32,963
- I like those too.
- Which ones?

452
00:26:33,673 --> 00:26:35,088
Beer can?

453
00:26:35,683 --> 00:26:39,271
[So Ri is more of a can of beer type.]

454
00:26:39,747 --> 00:26:41,765
Yes, hot Americano.

455
00:26:42,534 --> 00:26:45,528
- They won't leave without us, will they?
- Of course not.

456
00:26:46,331 --> 00:26:48,823
I'm sorry, but we're in a bit of a hurry.

457
00:26:49,801 --> 00:26:51,733
Actually, Kim Jong Kook doesn't eat
things like this.

458
00:26:51,734 --> 00:26:53,323
Then we only need seven hotdogs.

459
00:26:53,324 --> 00:26:54,677
[Not even counting the health-nut,
Jong Kook in his order.]

460
00:26:55,847 --> 00:26:59,214
[Just then...]

461
00:26:59,215 --> 00:27:03,285
[The train pulls up at the station!]

462
00:27:03,286 --> 00:27:05,879
They're seriously not back yet?

463
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:08,415
[What do they do?]

464
00:27:09,687 --> 00:27:12,439
[Jae Suk and So Ri must hurry!]

465
00:27:13,456 --> 00:27:16,281
- Thank you.
- Thank you. Have a nice day!

466
00:27:16,282 --> 00:27:20,109
[Finally on their way back
after getting the snacks!]

467
00:27:21,953 --> 00:27:25,027
- This isn't our train, is it?
- No, this is our train.

468
00:27:25,539 --> 00:27:29,226
[But the snack team is still
nowhere to be seen!]

469
00:27:31,806 --> 00:27:33,155
Is the train here yet?

470
00:27:36,741 --> 00:27:38,783
- They seriously aren't back yet.
- Are we really going to leave without them?

471
00:27:39,345 --> 00:27:45,000
[Will Jae Suk and So Ri get left behind?]

472
00:27:46,598 --> 00:27:48,353
- There they are.
- They're here! Run!

473
00:27:48,354 --> 00:27:51,861
[They arrive just in time
for the train's departure!]

474
00:27:55,397 --> 00:27:57,393
Come on, you need to hurry!

475
00:28:01,871 --> 00:28:05,354
[Close call,
but even So Ri makes it back on time.]

476
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,181
We could've been in big trouble.

477
00:28:08,804 --> 00:28:11,014
Any later, and we would've missed our train.

478
00:28:11,015 --> 00:28:14,038
[A close call right from
the start of the mission.]

479
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:19,675
[They would've missed the train if the snow
hadn't delayed the train by three minutes.]

480
00:28:19,676 --> 00:28:23,632
[The train departs as soon as
they board.]

481
00:28:24,268 --> 00:28:26,947
- A pretty romantic train ride, isn't it?
- Yes, it's nice.

482
00:28:26,948 --> 00:28:30,577
[A romantic train ride on a snowy day.]

483
00:28:30,945 --> 00:28:35,233
- The train will stop at the Yongsan Station.
- Yongsan Station?

484
00:28:35,268 --> 00:28:38,565
You must get off at the station,
and complete the mission with your partner

485
00:28:38,566 --> 00:28:40,150
and get back on the train as soon as
you've completed the mission.

486
00:28:40,151 --> 00:28:42,869
- We have to get back after the mission.
- If you don't make it back on the train...

487
00:28:42,869 --> 00:28:44,976
- we will be leaving without you.
- Seriously?

488
00:28:45,509 --> 00:28:49,783
All members have to make it back on the train
within the time limit in order for it to count

489
00:28:49,784 --> 00:28:51,555
and for us to give you your hints.

490
00:28:51,555 --> 00:28:54,044
Kwang Soo is usually the one to get
left behind in such situations.

491
00:28:54,045 --> 00:28:55,589
If not me, then usually it's you.

492
00:28:55,590 --> 00:28:59,950
Since we all need the clue,
we all need to succeed together as a team.

493
00:28:59,951 --> 00:29:02,819
[It's a group mission where
they all have to succeed equally.]

494
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:04,788
- You all need to wear these couple gloves.
- We need to wear them together?

495
00:29:04,789 --> 00:29:07,925
[Rule- They all must wear the couple gloves
together at all times.]

496
00:29:07,926 --> 00:29:09,747
Everyone must put the gloves on right now.

497
00:29:09,747 --> 00:29:11,831
Here are the missions that
you all need to do at the next station.

498
00:29:13,899 --> 00:29:15,696
- Which number?
- Number five.

499
00:29:16,318 --> 00:29:20,964
[Each couple to choose their own missions.]

500
00:29:22,228 --> 00:29:24,537
- We haven't received ours yet.
- Don't look at your missions yet.

501
00:29:25,422 --> 00:29:26,841
You can't open the mission envelopes yet.

502
00:29:27,406 --> 00:29:28,803
Why not?

503
00:29:30,285 --> 00:29:31,982
Is this a joke?

504
00:29:32,715 --> 00:29:34,645
She's getting mad.

505
00:29:34,646 --> 00:29:37,701
So we have to do everything as you say?
Is that it?

506
00:29:37,702 --> 00:29:39,613
All day?

507
00:29:39,614 --> 00:29:42,784
- Say something if you're angry.
- We have to do as he says all day?

508
00:29:42,785 --> 00:29:44,821
I just realized that we've been doing
everything as he says.

509
00:29:44,822 --> 00:29:47,637
- Like putting these gloves on for example.
- Are you mad again?

510
00:29:47,638 --> 00:29:50,462
I'm slowly starting to get a little angry.

511
00:29:51,469 --> 00:29:55,937
- I have to keep doing as he says?
- She really suits Jong Kook very well.

512
00:29:55,938 --> 00:29:58,998
Because Jong Kook is always getting
angry at everything too.

513
00:29:58,999 --> 00:30:00,891
[The angry couple.]

514
00:30:00,892 --> 00:30:03,614
I feel like it's Jong Kook talking
in a woman's voice.

515
00:30:03,615 --> 00:30:06,869
- I'm just asking because I don't know.
- Jong Kook is exactly like you.

516
00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:08,821
- You're a female Jong Kook.
- I'm sorry.

517
00:30:10,562 --> 00:30:15,146
[Yongsan Station-
One minute before the train's arrival.]

518
00:30:15,992 --> 00:30:18,362
- You may open your envelopes now.
- Open it now?

519
00:30:18,566 --> 00:30:20,373
Open it up.
I really hope it's something easy.

520
00:30:20,408 --> 00:30:23,039
- We can open it now?
- What is it?

521
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,773
[Oh my...]

522
00:30:25,935 --> 00:30:29,061
[Everyone's looking a bit lost.]

523
00:30:29,475 --> 00:30:32,606
We have to get a camera out of a locker, and
take a picture with the station in the back.

524
00:30:32,607 --> 00:30:36,266
We have to find money from a locker and
eat green tea noodles and green tea ice cream.

525
00:30:36,267 --> 00:30:38,970
- Seriously?
- Where's the locker?

526
00:30:38,971 --> 00:30:44,434
We have to get money from an ATM and
buy 5 Americanos and 5 caramel macchiato.

527
00:30:44,894 --> 00:30:46,876
- What about you, Gary? What's your mission?
- Me?

528
00:30:46,877 --> 00:30:50,795
We have to find our money from a locker,
and get instant proof of a picture taken.

529
00:30:50,796 --> 00:30:52,423
Your mission is similar to ours.

530
00:30:52,424 --> 00:30:54,086
What about you, Min Soo?
What's your mission?

531
00:30:54,087 --> 00:30:56,759
We have to find our money and buy
four books with 'Fortune Teller' in the title.

532
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:59,208
We have to get out money from ATM first.

533
00:31:02,249 --> 00:31:05,800
[Train arrives at Yongsan Station.]

534
00:31:10,701 --> 00:31:12,761
You have nine minutes to finish
your mission.

535
00:31:12,762 --> 00:31:15,828
- That's enough time to succeed your mission.
- Let's all succeed our missions!

536
00:31:15,829 --> 00:31:19,686
[Just complete the mission and board
the train within nine minutes!]

537
00:31:20,539 --> 00:31:23,818
[The train will depart
at exactly five o'clock!]

538
00:31:25,010 --> 00:31:33,363
[The door opens...
and everyone must hurry!]

539
00:31:37,017 --> 00:31:40,101
[Run!]

540
00:31:40,102 --> 00:31:42,010
We have to go work, Jung Hwa!

541
00:31:42,011 --> 00:31:44,953
- We have to go work!
- I'm sick and tired of working!

542
00:31:47,964 --> 00:31:50,221
We're two guys and
we're the slowest, Suk Jin.

543
00:31:50,632 --> 00:31:54,886
[They all must hurry to their lockers,
and their ATM's!]

544
00:31:55,589 --> 00:31:58,190
[Into the station!]

545
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:02,866
[Angry couple,
Jong Kook and Min Soo are in the lead!]

546
00:32:04,272 --> 00:32:07,840
- Where are the ATM's?
- They're over there!

547
00:32:08,463 --> 00:32:12,134
[Everyone goes their own way
to complete their missions.]

548
00:32:13,211 --> 00:32:18,694
[Get 50,000 won out of the ATM and buy
four books with 'Fortune Teller' in the title.]

549
00:32:18,978 --> 00:32:23,027
[Get 50,000 out of the ATM and buy
5 Americano and 5 caramel macchiato coffees.]

550
00:32:24,332 --> 00:32:25,634
0207.

551
00:32:29,296 --> 00:32:30,794
- 50,000 won, right?
- Yes, 50,000 won.

552
00:32:34,622 --> 00:32:38,512
[Both teams withdraw
50,000 won from the ATM.]

553
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:41,442
We got it.

554
00:32:42,746 --> 00:32:45,881
[The rest of the teams find their way
over to the lockers.]

555
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:52,280
[Get their money from locker D-51 and
get an instant proof of picture taken.]

556
00:32:54,246 --> 00:32:59,560
[Get money from locker A-13.
Buy and eat green tea noodles and ice cream.]

557
00:32:59,561 --> 00:33:01,509
- Where are the 'C' lockers?
- I don't see them.

558
00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:03,590
Where are the 'C' lockers?

559
00:33:04,896 --> 00:33:08,331
[Suk Jin and Kwang Soo can't even
find their locker.]

560
00:33:08,332 --> 00:33:09,939
We're in big trouble.
Let's ask someone.

561
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:12,830
- Help us find our locker!
- Where are the lockers?

562
00:33:13,931 --> 00:33:19,160
[The time is ticking by...]

563
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:23,643
[Two minutes have already passed.]

564
00:33:23,644 --> 00:33:26,254
Let's go find a coffee stand.
Hold my hand.

565
00:33:26,255 --> 00:33:29,615
[Jae Suk and So Ri are first
to get their money.]

566
00:33:31,909 --> 00:33:33,858
- Where can we find our coffee?
- That stand might have it.

567
00:33:33,859 --> 00:33:35,702
They don't have Americano.

568
00:33:37,708 --> 00:33:39,516
Caramel macchiato?

569
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:41,932
- Where are we going to find it?
- They have it here.

570
00:33:45,463 --> 00:33:49,780
Hello. We need five Americanos,
and five caramel macchiato.

571
00:33:49,781 --> 00:33:53,655
[Rush order of five Americanos,
and five caramel macchiato.]

572
00:33:55,332 --> 00:33:58,036
- Here's the money.
- Here's 30,000 won.

573
00:33:58,037 --> 00:34:00,208
There's 30,000 won.

574
00:34:00,631 --> 00:34:03,066
- Thank you.
- Can I get a receipt for that?

575
00:34:03,386 --> 00:34:07,204
[Frugal house wife still remembering to
get the receipt at a time like this.]

576
00:34:07,205 --> 00:34:08,540
Thank you.

577
00:34:09,276 --> 00:34:11,148
- Give us five minutes.
- Five minutes?

578
00:34:11,149 --> 00:34:12,818
- Yes, okay.
- Put them in a carrier please.

579
00:34:12,819 --> 00:34:15,541
Our train takes off in five minutes.

580
00:34:15,542 --> 00:34:17,408
Please get us the coffees
within three minutes.

581
00:34:18,156 --> 00:34:19,556
I'm sorry.

582
00:34:19,964 --> 00:34:22,084
- There it is!
- Where?

583
00:34:22,447 --> 00:34:25,390
[Discovers the
green tea refreshment stand.]

584
00:34:25,391 --> 00:34:30,572
- Ma'am... we need one green tea noodles...
- And one green tea ice cream.

585
00:34:30,573 --> 00:34:33,326
- One soft serve green tea ice cream.
- Very little broth with the noodles.

586
00:34:35,581 --> 00:34:38,853
[Speedy serving of the noodles.]

587
00:34:38,854 --> 00:34:41,455
I'm going to take the gloves off for a second.

588
00:34:43,861 --> 00:34:46,088
- It's not cooked yet.
- Just open it up.

589
00:34:48,921 --> 00:34:50,464
I wonder if we can do this.

590
00:34:51,049 --> 00:34:52,596
There it is.
Let's eat the ice cream first.

591
00:34:52,597 --> 00:34:55,076
[Even the ice cream is served
at the speed of light.]

592
00:34:59,835 --> 00:35:01,301
Wow, that's cold.

593
00:35:03,653 --> 00:35:05,006
We have to eat it quickly.

594
00:35:07,423 --> 00:35:09,707
[Meanwhile...]

595
00:35:09,708 --> 00:35:12,597
[Easy Brothers are still
looking for their locker.]

596
00:35:13,315 --> 00:35:15,840
Do you think that
this mission is even possible?

597
00:35:16,450 --> 00:35:18,364
I'm sure they've already tried it.

598
00:35:20,488 --> 00:35:23,192
- The photo booth is over there!
- Where?

599
00:35:23,193 --> 00:35:26,056
- Over there to the front.
- We have to find our locker!

600
00:35:27,927 --> 00:35:29,866
'C' lockers... here they are.

601
00:35:29,867 --> 00:35:33,352
[Go outside to take a picture of themselves
with the station in the background.]

602
00:35:33,353 --> 00:35:35,904
[They have to go outside for the picture
when they don't even have the time.]

603
00:35:35,905 --> 00:35:37,394
Where?
Where is it?

604
00:35:37,395 --> 00:35:38,775
There it is!

605
00:35:38,776 --> 00:35:40,710
- There!
- Come on.

606
00:35:40,711 --> 00:35:44,024
[Gary and Jung Hwa find
the instant photo booth.]

607
00:35:44,025 --> 00:35:45,752
How do we do this?

608
00:35:45,753 --> 00:35:47,611
Should I go inside?

609
00:35:47,612 --> 00:35:49,503
It won't accept a 10,000 won bill.

610
00:35:49,504 --> 00:35:52,679
[10,000 won bill won't fit.
Must put in two 5,000 won bills.]

611
00:35:53,065 --> 00:35:55,294
10,000 won.
Try it one more time.

612
00:35:55,295 --> 00:35:57,420
- Why wouldn't it fit?
- Right here.

613
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:00,003
It won't work.

614
00:36:00,004 --> 00:36:03,620
[Off to the convenience store to
get smaller change.]

615
00:36:04,983 --> 00:36:09,117
[Easy Brothers are finally headed
outside the building for their picture.]

616
00:36:11,016 --> 00:36:13,879
[Gary and Jung Hwa are back with
their smaller bills.]

617
00:36:15,877 --> 00:36:18,245
[Jung Hwa heads into the booth first.]

618
00:36:19,530 --> 00:36:21,117
- Is it not going in?
- Why isn't it going in?

619
00:36:23,679 --> 00:36:27,004
We should've gotten change for
another 10,000 won.

620
00:36:27,005 --> 00:36:30,559
[There's no time!
It's more than 5,000 won per person!]

621
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,146
We have to shut the curtain.

622
00:36:32,795 --> 00:36:34,337
You have to look straight ahead.

623
00:36:36,853 --> 00:36:38,607
Okay, I got it.

624
00:36:42,111 --> 00:36:44,126
Are you done, Jung Hwa?

625
00:36:44,611 --> 00:36:47,823
[Still have to make sure that my picture
comes out looking pretty.]

626
00:36:47,824 --> 00:36:49,994
- Jung Hwa!
- I have to take another picture.

627
00:36:50,029 --> 00:36:51,741
- It takes two pictures.
- Seriously?

628
00:36:51,742 --> 00:36:54,365
<i>We will now take the second picture.

629
00:36:55,725 --> 00:36:57,373
I said, I got it.

630
00:36:58,747 --> 00:37:01,529
[But still a pro when it comes to
getting her picture taken.]

631
00:37:05,039 --> 00:37:07,163
All set?
Let's go get some more change.

632
00:37:07,722 --> 00:37:11,394
[Off to get some more change.]

633
00:37:12,027 --> 00:37:13,651
- Where? Do you see it?
- Over here.

634
00:37:13,652 --> 00:37:16,993
[Three minutes have passed.
Only six minutes left on the clock.]

635
00:37:19,077 --> 00:37:22,283
[Jong Kook and Min Soo find a bookstore
with their money in hand.]

636
00:37:22,284 --> 00:37:28,591
- 'Fortune Teller'...
- We need books with those words in the title.

637
00:37:28,592 --> 00:37:30,392
- You have to find the books yourselves.
- We have to find the books ourselves?

638
00:37:30,393 --> 00:37:33,094
[Thank you, Miss Clerk, for your quick wit.]

639
00:37:34,052 --> 00:37:39,799
[Find four books with each of
the letters within the title!]

640
00:37:41,712 --> 00:37:44,945
[Where are you...]

641
00:37:44,946 --> 00:37:47,385
- 'To-jung-bi-gyeol'. I'm going to lose it.
-  'To-jung-bi-gyeol'.

642
00:37:49,156 --> 00:37:51,629
-  'To-jung-bi-gyeol'...
- Oh my goodness. I don't see any.

643
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:54,843
[Harder to see anything
when they're in such a rush.]

644
00:37:54,844 --> 00:37:56,621
Did they hide it somewhere in
the corner?

645
00:38:00,822 --> 00:38:08,095
[In the meantime...
the time keeps on ticking.]

646
00:38:11,578 --> 00:38:15,164
[They're finally outside!
Must see the station name for it to count.]

647
00:38:18,911 --> 00:38:22,142
[Click, click... jump, and click.]

648
00:38:22,143 --> 00:38:24,240
One of those shots had to have
turned out okay?.

649
00:38:24,241 --> 00:38:26,630
I hope we got at least one.
Keep taking pictures.

650
00:38:26,631 --> 00:38:29,728
We're going to have to...
The first picture isn't even developed yet.

651
00:38:31,042 --> 00:38:32,835
- What's going on here.
- Suk Jin!

652
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:36,678
[He drops one of the pictures on the ground!]

653
00:38:36,679 --> 00:38:39,074
Take another one.
The picture isn't even developing.

654
00:38:39,075 --> 00:38:40,856
[Only thing they can do
is to keep taking pictures.]

655
00:38:41,773 --> 00:38:43,869
Are you capturing the name
of the station in the background?

656
00:38:43,870 --> 00:38:46,665
[Are they capturing
the name of the station?]

657
00:38:49,872 --> 00:38:52,699
- 'To-jung-bi-gyeol'...
- I don't see anything.

658
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:56,449
I don't see it...
Here's one! I found one.

659
00:38:56,450 --> 00:38:58,782
Did you find 'Jung'?

660
00:39:00,542 --> 00:39:02,467
I can't believe how tough it is
to find these books!

661
00:39:02,468 --> 00:39:04,096
['Jung' is checked off the list.]

662
00:39:05,934 --> 00:39:07,711
We've got 'Jung' and 'Gyeol'.

663
00:39:07,712 --> 00:39:10,662
You're good at finding those.

664
00:39:14,464 --> 00:39:16,908
Here.
I found a book with 'Bi'.

665
00:39:19,135 --> 00:39:20,744
- We just need something with 'To'.
- That's all we need to find?

666
00:39:22,035 --> 00:39:25,456
[They'll succeed their mission if they can
find a book with 'To' in the title!]

667
00:39:25,457 --> 00:39:29,831
[Looking for a book with all the letters
in the title instead.]

668
00:39:29,832 --> 00:39:33,374
- Here?
- Look here for a 'To-jung-bi-gyeol' book.

669
00:39:35,867 --> 00:39:40,340
[Gary and Jung Hwa head back to the
photo booth after getting some more change.]

670
00:39:45,176 --> 00:39:47,008
Where's my picture?

671
00:39:47,009 --> 00:39:49,714
Your picture should be coming out now.
It's coming out now, isn't' it?

672
00:39:49,715 --> 00:39:52,032
Yeah, I got it.
The screen isn't back up yet.

673
00:39:52,568 --> 00:39:54,504
- Okay, it's working.
- Wow, the picture came out so pretty.

674
00:39:54,505 --> 00:39:56,080
Okay, we're good to go.

675
00:39:56,925 --> 00:39:59,961
[They just need to get
Gary's picture taken now.]

676
00:39:59,962 --> 00:40:03,228
[Awkward]

677
00:40:08,626 --> 00:40:11,092
Come on, hurry!
Let's take one more.

678
00:40:12,946 --> 00:40:16,167
[The Green tea couple on the other hand
is still screaming out sounds of agony.]

679
00:40:17,863 --> 00:40:21,456
[Eat the cold ice cream...]

680
00:40:21,457 --> 00:40:23,734
[And eat the hot, and uncooked noodles.]

681
00:40:29,978 --> 00:40:31,560
Ji Hyo, want to switch?

682
00:40:33,224 --> 00:40:35,532
Let's switch for a little bit.

683
00:40:36,581 --> 00:40:38,249
The noodles are crunchy like cookies.

684
00:40:39,965 --> 00:40:42,440
- So hot!
- The noodles are still really crunchy.

685
00:40:44,254 --> 00:40:46,994
[So cold!]

686
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:51,966
But the ice cream still tastes really good.

687
00:40:55,298 --> 00:40:59,325
[Noodles... with ice cream as the topping.]

688
00:41:01,330 --> 00:41:02,908
We're done with the ice cream.

689
00:41:02,909 --> 00:41:05,776
[Ice cream is all done!]

690
00:41:08,448 --> 00:41:11,286
[There's no time!]

691
00:41:12,868 --> 00:41:16,287
[Let's run with the bowl of noodles in hand!]

692
00:41:16,288 --> 00:41:19,692
[Finish drinking the broth on their way!]

693
00:41:19,693 --> 00:41:21,876
- Hey, drink some of this.
- Why is this door opening so slow?

694
00:41:26,738 --> 00:41:29,601
[Run three steps,
and take a sip of the broth.]

695
00:41:32,599 --> 00:41:34,203
- Come on, Jae Suk!
- Thank you.

696
00:41:36,876 --> 00:41:39,428
- We still need four more drinks.
- Are you guys done?

697
00:41:41,474 --> 00:41:43,811
- Those guys are done with their mission.
- Four more drinks.

698
00:41:43,812 --> 00:41:45,234
[Feeling even more anxious as they see
another team pass them by.]

699
00:41:45,235 --> 00:41:48,745
It's okay if the Americano is watery.
Make it really weak if it'll be faster.

700
00:41:49,661 --> 00:41:51,980
Please don't make us miss our train.

701
00:41:55,673 --> 00:42:00,275
[Jong Kook and Min Soo only need to find
one more book with 'To' in the title.]

702
00:42:00,276 --> 00:42:01,954
'To-jung-bi-gyeol'!
It's right here!

703
00:42:01,955 --> 00:42:07,215
[They succeed in finding four books with each
of the 'To-jung-bi-gyeol' letters in the title.]

704
00:42:08,606 --> 00:42:11,694
[Jong Kook and Min Soo clear their mission.]

705
00:42:16,343 --> 00:42:19,244
Are we all done?
Let's go.

706
00:42:20,982 --> 00:42:23,364
[Gary and Jung Hwa also succeed
their mission.]

707
00:42:23,365 --> 00:42:26,979
[They need to hurry and
get back on the train!]

708
00:42:29,495 --> 00:42:31,428
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

709
00:42:31,429 --> 00:42:33,354
We're sorry for causing so much
inconvenience.

710
00:42:33,355 --> 00:42:35,118
- Have a great day. Sorry again!
- Thank you!

711
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:38,510
[Jae Suk and So Ri succeed in buying
their ten cups of coffee.]

712
00:42:38,511 --> 00:42:41,324
[Back to the train platform!]

713
00:42:43,246 --> 00:42:47,047
[Will the train of destiny still be there?]

714
00:42:47,048 --> 00:42:48,290
We're all finished!

715
00:42:49,142 --> 00:42:50,860
Here, give it to me.
I can carry those books.

716
00:42:52,573 --> 00:42:56,404
[Run!]

717
00:42:57,995 --> 00:43:01,982
[Miss the train, and they'll be left stranded!]

718
00:43:05,966 --> 00:43:09,630
[First place- Ha Ha and Ji Hyo.]

719
00:43:09,631 --> 00:43:12,908
[Second place- Jong Kook and Min Soo.]

720
00:43:16,961 --> 00:43:21,521
[These two teams make it safely
back to the train platform.]

721
00:43:21,997 --> 00:43:25,444
[Oh?]

722
00:43:25,445 --> 00:43:28,388
[But...]

723
00:43:33,596 --> 00:43:39,060
[The train... is nowhere to be seen?]

724
00:43:41,743 --> 00:43:43,700
The train must've left.

725
00:43:44,221 --> 00:43:46,026
[That's strange...]

726
00:43:46,027 --> 00:43:49,526
[We know we definitely
made it back within the time limit...]

727
00:43:49,527 --> 00:43:51,884
[Just what is going on here?]

728
00:43:52,732 --> 00:43:55,902
[Right before they
made it back to the platform.]

729
00:43:59,828 --> 00:44:04,207
[The platform suddenly seems to be
full of activity?]

730
00:44:04,208 --> 00:44:08,845
[Then...]

731
00:44:08,846 --> 00:44:11,379
<i>What are you guys doing?

732
00:44:11,380 --> 00:44:16,033
[The train doors suddenly close!]

733
00:44:21,501 --> 00:44:23,423
<i>Why is the train moving?

734
00:44:23,424 --> 00:44:25,408
<i>The train is leaving.

735
00:44:25,906 --> 00:44:30,341
[Even the crew members who were still
aboard the train are flustered and confused.]

736
00:44:31,932 --> 00:44:38,069
[The train... is leaving?]

737
00:44:39,173 --> 00:44:43,448
[They find out with the train having been
delayed three minutes earlier...]

738
00:44:43,449 --> 00:44:50,448
[The train leaves this station three minutes
earlier to keep up with the initial schedule.]

739
00:44:50,449 --> 00:44:53,393
<i>If the teams make it back
by five o'clock...

740
00:44:53,394 --> 00:44:56,140
[How can this be?]

741
00:44:56,141 --> 00:44:57,971
Everyone gather over here for now.

742
00:45:00,828 --> 00:45:04,998
[Gary, Jung Hwa, Jae Suk, and So Ri
also make it back to the platform.]

743
00:45:08,355 --> 00:45:10,309
- The train isn't here.
- Run!

744
00:45:10,310 --> 00:45:12,572
- The train isn't here!
- You guys have to run!

745
00:45:15,171 --> 00:45:16,995
- Where's the train!
- Why isn't the train here?

746
00:45:16,996 --> 00:45:21,662
[Since they were given nine minutes,
make it by five o'clock, and it's a success!]

747
00:45:21,663 --> 00:45:23,604
We're still missing one team?

748
00:45:23,605 --> 00:45:25,328
The male team isn't here.

749
00:45:26,316 --> 00:45:28,503
- Isn't this it?
- You can't see the station sign.

750
00:45:29,261 --> 00:45:31,904
[The pictures are
finally starting to develop.]

751
00:45:31,905 --> 00:45:34,179
- What is this?
- It's a good picture of us though.

752
00:45:34,180 --> 00:45:36,081
- This isn't good either.
- I'm going to keep this picture.

753
00:45:36,795 --> 00:45:38,936
[You like the picture?]

754
00:45:38,937 --> 00:45:42,233
The train was supposed to be
here for nine minutes.

755
00:45:42,234 --> 00:45:45,975
You were supposed to board back on the train
after succeeding your missions in 9 minutes.

756
00:45:45,976 --> 00:45:49,998
But what's going on right now is, since
the previous train was delayed by 3 minutes

757
00:45:49,999 --> 00:45:52,520
our current train left three minutes
prior to its scheduled time.

758
00:45:52,521 --> 00:45:59,066
They left three minutes earlier to catch up
to the time that they've lost.

759
00:45:59,067 --> 00:46:01,700
Then what happens to us?
We don't have a train?

760
00:46:01,701 --> 00:46:06,737
So what we've decided to do is,
just like the time that we've figured on...

761
00:46:06,738 --> 00:46:09,639
four of the five teams have made it back
within the time that you initially were given.

762
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:11,848
- Is it showing?
- Can you see the station sign?

763
00:46:11,849 --> 00:46:13,721
[Everyone made it back with
the exception of this team.]

764
00:46:14,837 --> 00:46:17,446
Okay.
Did you get the picture?

765
00:46:17,447 --> 00:46:20,192
- Okay. Thank you.
- Grab my hand, Suk Jin.

766
00:46:20,193 --> 00:46:22,993
[Everyone will succeed their mission
if only this team can make it back on time.]

767
00:46:22,994 --> 00:46:27,926
If even one team doesn't make it back on time,
then all of you will fail your missions.

768
00:46:27,927 --> 00:46:30,025
- Kwang Soo.
- That's the only team that we're missing.

769
00:46:31,983 --> 00:46:36,578
[Run... run... run!]

770
00:46:36,579 --> 00:46:39,472
- Come on, Kwang Soo.
- Min Soo found all the books.

771
00:46:39,473 --> 00:46:42,826
[Everyone's fate is riding
on the Easy Brothers.]

772
00:46:44,316 --> 00:46:48,705
[They must make it back before
the clock hits 5:01.]

773
00:46:48,706 --> 00:46:50,258
There they come!

774
00:46:50,259 --> 00:46:52,857
- Hurry!
- Run!

775
00:46:53,426 --> 00:46:56,270
[They're finally here!]

776
00:46:57,400 --> 00:46:59,555
There are only a few seconds left!
Hurry!

777
00:47:00,347 --> 00:47:02,341
- Hurry!
- Run!

778
00:47:06,220 --> 00:47:08,960
[Min Soo is showing her competitive side.]

779
00:47:10,816 --> 00:47:14,689
[Everyone's back on the platform!]

780
00:47:14,690 --> 00:47:18,370
We had to take a picture with the
station sign in the background.

781
00:47:20,312 --> 00:47:27,261
[Will they be able to earn their hint?]

782
00:47:27,262 --> 00:47:28,646
- You failed your mission.
- Why?

783
00:47:28,647 --> 00:47:30,474
Do you all see the current time?

784
00:47:30,475 --> 00:47:32,552
Do you all see the time?

785
00:47:32,553 --> 00:47:38,460
[Five o'clock was the deadline.
But it's now 5:02.]

786
00:47:38,461 --> 00:47:42,947
You were only going to succeed if all
five teams made it back within nine minutes.

787
00:47:42,948 --> 00:47:45,267
But one team didn't make it back on time.

788
00:47:45,268 --> 00:47:46,945
What's so hard about your mission
that you couldn't be back in time?

789
00:47:46,946 --> 00:47:50,059
You have no idea how hard it was to get
the station sign in the background.

790
00:47:50,060 --> 00:47:52,805
- What's so hard about that?
- It took four minutes for it to develop.

791
00:47:52,806 --> 00:47:55,562
- The pictures took forever to come out.
- We had to wait for it to come out.

792
00:47:55,927 --> 00:47:58,551
- You should've kept on taking it.
- We did keep taking pictures.

793
00:47:58,552 --> 00:48:01,884
- You should've done a better job.
- It takes four minutes for it to develop.

794
00:48:01,885 --> 00:48:05,767
- We couldn't just take anything.
- You should've been quicker about it.

795
00:48:05,768 --> 00:48:09,687
- You guys should've been faster about it.
- You guys are all being very cranky!

796
00:48:09,688 --> 00:48:12,220
How long have you been on this show
for you to be that slow?

797
00:48:12,221 --> 00:48:15,198
You should've just taken a bunch of pictures
since you know it'll develop sooner or later.

798
00:48:15,199 --> 00:48:18,348
- You should've been quicker about it.
- We did our best.

799
00:48:18,349 --> 00:48:19,880
I'm not going to hold back any longer.

800
00:48:19,881 --> 00:48:22,354
Remember what she was told?
She's not to hold back on her anger.

801
00:48:22,355 --> 00:48:24,828
[After having her fortune read,
So Ri will no longer hold back her anger!]

802
00:48:27,038 --> 00:48:30,042
We do have another train coming.

803
00:48:30,043 --> 00:48:33,246
[Will be on their way on the next train.]

804
00:48:34,445 --> 00:48:37,510
- We need to talk.
- What is there to talk about?

805
00:48:37,511 --> 00:48:39,945
[Scolded by the whole team.]

806
00:48:40,930 --> 00:48:44,018
[On standby until the next train arrives.]

807
00:48:44,019 --> 00:48:46,248
Even though you've all failed due to
Lee Kwang Soo and Ji Suk Jin...

808
00:48:47,354 --> 00:48:50,278
- Yes, you do need to blame them.
- However...

809
00:48:50,279 --> 00:48:53,694
Since the train left without us and all,
we will still give you one hint.

810
00:48:53,695 --> 00:48:58,604
We were going to give out three hints
if they also made it back on time.

811
00:48:58,605 --> 00:49:00,535
- Yes, we need to get at least one.
- We're sorry.

812
00:49:00,536 --> 00:49:02,228
We were initially going to give out three.

813
00:49:02,738 --> 00:49:06,728
Of all the couples that are
sitting here right now...

814
00:49:06,729 --> 00:49:09,032
None of the couples right now...

815
00:49:09,033 --> 00:49:10,962
are partners of destiny.

816
00:49:10,963 --> 00:49:15,340
[None of the current couples at the moment
are partners of destiny.]

817
00:49:15,341 --> 00:49:17,091
But we're such a great fit.

818
00:49:17,092 --> 00:49:22,960
You need to discuss how you're going to change
up your partners before our next location.

819
00:49:22,961 --> 00:49:25,670
[Must decide how the partners will
be switched up before the next round.]

820
00:49:25,671 --> 00:49:28,640
The fortune that we were told
initially held some hints.

821
00:49:28,641 --> 00:49:32,507
[The fortunes that were read during
the opening held some hints!]

822
00:49:33,371 --> 00:49:35,803
- What's your sign, Jung Hwa?
- Why are you asking me that?

823
00:49:35,804 --> 00:49:38,375
- He told you your compatible signs earlier.
- I'm the dragon sign.

824
00:49:38,376 --> 00:49:41,999
[Now that they think about it, she was told
she's compatible with Kkuk's sign.]

825
00:49:43,438 --> 00:49:48,217
<i>You're most compatible with signs of
the snake, horse, dragon and dog.

826
00:49:49,136 --> 00:49:52,396
[Mr. Capable with this dragon sign
is perfect for her?]

827
00:49:52,978 --> 00:49:55,365
[That's right, he did say that.]

828
00:49:55,366 --> 00:49:58,688
<i>It would be best if you met a woman
with big eyes.

829
00:49:58,689 --> 00:50:04,819
[Jong Kook was told to meet a woman with
big eyes, and a curvier body.]

830
00:50:05,744 --> 00:50:08,607
[In that case...]

831
00:50:08,608 --> 00:50:13,656
[Could Jong Kook and Jung Hwa
truly be partners of destiny?]

832
00:50:15,019 --> 00:50:18,944
- But you're not chubby.
- Just sexy?

833
00:50:20,892 --> 00:50:24,340
Here's what I think.
I think Gary and Ji Hyo will be a fit.

834
00:50:24,341 --> 00:50:28,734
[Monday couple, Gary and Ji Hyo
to be a perfect fit for each other?]

835
00:50:28,735 --> 00:50:31,020
- I'm curious to know myself.
- Okay, you two partner up.

836
00:50:31,021 --> 00:50:33,623
- Those two may be good together.
- And you and Suk Jin.

837
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:51,458
[Finally arrives at the next location
after a long train ride.]

838
00:50:54,726 --> 00:50:58,017
[What kind of a mission awaits them here?]

839
00:50:58,018 --> 00:51:00,608
- All the couples must sit together.
- Sit right here?

840
00:51:01,472 --> 00:51:03,740
- Did you all enjoy you train ride?
- Yes.

841
00:51:03,741 --> 00:51:05,692
We had to transfer a few times.

842
00:51:05,693 --> 00:51:08,430
Here's your next mission.

843
00:51:08,431 --> 00:51:10,560
The mission is called,
'Please answer my call'.

844
00:51:10,561 --> 00:51:14,028
Please go and collect the phones
from all the members.

845
00:51:14,029 --> 00:51:17,411
[All of their cellphones are to be turned in.]

846
00:51:18,403 --> 00:51:21,265
Each couple must step forward
and make a phone call.

847
00:51:21,266 --> 00:51:24,859
If the person on the other end answers the
phone call within the time limit, you succeed.

848
00:51:24,860 --> 00:51:27,373
- The other person has to answer the call?
- Then isn't that pretty easy?

849
00:51:27,374 --> 00:51:30,898
We've already decided
who you're going to call for you.

850
00:51:30,899 --> 00:51:32,720
Please unveil the curtain.

851
00:51:35,693 --> 00:51:37,736
- What is that?
- You want me to unveil it?

852
00:51:37,737 --> 00:51:39,486
[What is that?]

853
00:51:41,868 --> 00:51:44,164
[I'm getting... a bad feeling about this.]

854
00:51:46,923 --> 00:51:49,481
- What is this?
- What are we going to do?

855
00:51:50,443 --> 00:51:54,103
[A giant spinning wheels with the names
of various celebrities!]

856
00:51:54,104 --> 00:51:56,617
How are we going to call Jackie Chan?

857
00:51:56,618 --> 00:51:59,723
They're all names of previous guests
who have been on Running Man before.

858
00:51:59,724 --> 00:52:04,047
And we've also picked those whom you've either
worked with or are already friends with.

859
00:52:04,048 --> 00:52:06,061
Those are the names that you'll find
on the spinning wheel.

860
00:52:06,062 --> 00:52:13,189
Each of you need to come out and
call the name that your spin lands on.

861
00:52:13,190 --> 00:52:17,685
If you don't know their number,
then ask within your group for the number.

862
00:52:17,686 --> 00:52:21,266
You can ask for help to obtain the number
to place the call.

863
00:52:21,267 --> 00:52:24,609
- Since we're all friends, right?
- There's my husband's name, Jang Joon Hwan.

864
00:52:24,771 --> 00:52:26,454
There's one person that I know.

865
00:52:27,563 --> 00:52:30,090
What you need to remember is that
even if you know the number

866
00:52:30,091 --> 00:52:32,507
you'll fail the mission if they don't
answer the call within the time limit.

867
00:52:32,508 --> 00:52:34,334
We're all a team.
We have to help each other.

868
00:52:34,335 --> 00:52:38,609
If all five teams succeed within the first try,
then you'll be given three separate hints.

869
00:52:38,610 --> 00:52:40,952
[Three hints if all five teams
succeed in first attempt.]

870
00:52:40,953 --> 00:52:44,520
- We need to hurry.
- We succeed if they just answer, right?

871
00:52:44,521 --> 00:52:46,245
You succeed if they just answer the call.

872
00:52:46,246 --> 00:52:48,286
- Should we go first?
- You go first.

873
00:52:48,782 --> 00:52:52,062
[Jong Kook and Jung Hwa to go first.]

874
00:52:52,507 --> 00:52:55,833
People don't usually take my phone calls.

875
00:52:55,834 --> 00:52:57,558
That's why you should
always be nice to people.

876
00:52:57,559 --> 00:53:01,146
- Just spin the wheel.
- She said she recently changed her number.

877
00:53:01,810 --> 00:53:03,420
One, two, three.

878
00:53:03,421 --> 00:53:06,248
[Time to pick their first caller!]

879
00:53:08,025 --> 00:53:11,304
[The wheel is spinning!]

880
00:53:11,305 --> 00:53:13,500
- We have to succeed!
- What are we going to do!

881
00:53:13,501 --> 00:53:15,546
[Whose name will get picked?]

882
00:53:15,547 --> 00:53:19,044
[The fate of the mission rides on the wheel!]

883
00:53:19,045 --> 00:53:21,544
- Who? Who is it?
- It'll stop right around here.

884
00:53:21,545 --> 00:53:24,752
[The wheel is full of
names of various celebrities.]

885
00:53:28,791 --> 00:53:30,989
- It's Lee Min Jung.
- Min Jung.

886
00:53:30,990 --> 00:53:33,433
[Lee Min Jung is chosen!]

887
00:53:34,638 --> 00:53:37,663
[She showed a refreshingly attractive
side of herself in the Hong Kong episode!]

888
00:53:37,664 --> 00:53:40,986
[Will she answer their call?]

889
00:53:40,987 --> 00:53:43,161
- It's Lee Ming Jung.
- Min Jung.

890
00:53:43,162 --> 00:53:46,049
- I have her number!
- You have her number?

891
00:53:46,050 --> 00:53:47,850
- I have her number!
- You have her number?

892
00:53:47,851 --> 00:53:50,613
[Min Jung and Kwang Soo filmed the movie,
'Wonderful Radio' together in the past.]

893
00:53:50,614 --> 00:53:52,025
That's my phone!

894
00:53:52,026 --> 00:53:55,808
[They need to unlock
Kwang Soo's phone first.]

895
00:53:55,809 --> 00:53:57,851
You need to draw your finer down,
and bring the tail back up like this.

896
00:53:58,110 --> 00:54:01,231
[Mission impossible code...]

897
00:54:02,148 --> 00:54:05,081
[Kkuk-Vatar is taking orders from
Kwang-Vatar.]

898
00:54:05,082 --> 00:54:09,279
Go like this, and come down to the middle,
and go down one.

899
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:11,721
[Kwang Soo's never-ending lock code pattern.]

900
00:54:11,722 --> 00:54:14,916
- Zero... six...
- Yeah?

901
00:54:15,430 --> 00:54:17,813
[Jung Hwa in the meantime is already
calling someone.]

902
00:54:19,630 --> 00:54:22,099
- Who are you calling?
- Lee Byung Hun. (Min Jung's husband.)

903
00:54:23,546 --> 00:54:28,095
What is this?
Who are you to have a code like this?

904
00:54:30,587 --> 00:54:34,061
[They're wasting too much time
trying to unlock his phone.]

905
00:54:34,062 --> 00:54:35,977
- I got to five.
- Then bring it down.

906
00:54:35,978 --> 00:54:39,068
[So frustrating...]

907
00:54:39,282 --> 00:54:42,222
[Secretive Kwang Soo...
with so many secrets to hide.]

908
00:54:42,223 --> 00:54:43,459
I got it.

909
00:54:43,460 --> 00:54:45,300
[Finally gets the phone unlocked.]

910
00:54:45,301 --> 00:54:47,784
[Now they have to find her number.]

911
00:54:50,111 --> 00:54:51,459
Hurry up and call her!

912
00:54:52,956 --> 00:54:55,231
You have to type faster!

913
00:54:55,775 --> 00:54:57,343
Please answer!

914
00:54:57,344 --> 00:54:59,057
I just called her a few days ago!

915
00:55:01,808 --> 00:55:03,929
[Only three seconds left on the clock!]

916
00:55:03,930 --> 00:55:05,967
- Just give us a few more seconds.
- Two seconds.

917
00:55:05,968 --> 00:55:10,835
[She just... needs to answer their call.]

918
00:55:10,836 --> 00:55:13,925
[Please...]

919
00:55:17,078 --> 00:55:20,237
[Time over!]

920
00:55:20,238 --> 00:55:22,870
[Fails the first round.]

921
00:55:22,871 --> 00:55:25,219
She did say that
she's really busy lately.

922
00:55:26,403 --> 00:55:29,055
- You failed the first round.
- She's not answering.

923
00:55:31,929 --> 00:55:36,473
- We just failed the first round.
- Min Jung isn't even answering your call.

924
00:55:37,042 --> 00:55:39,803
- There's no way she wouldn't answer my call.
- What do you mean? It just happened.

925
00:55:39,804 --> 00:55:42,356
[What do you mean, she won't?]

926
00:55:43,659 --> 00:55:46,397
But we could get one of my friends, Jung Eun.
Kim Jung Eun.

927
00:55:47,238 --> 00:55:51,182
[Aha! They could call
someone else of the same name!]

928
00:55:51,183 --> 00:55:53,744
- It could be someone of the same name.
- I know a writer named Kim Tae Hee.

929
00:55:53,745 --> 00:55:55,648
The wheel doesn't state that
it has to be a celebrity.

930
00:55:55,649 --> 00:55:57,263
[I guess... we didn't state that
it has to be a celebrity.]

931
00:55:57,264 --> 00:55:59,757
[Moon So Ri's clever thinking.]

932
00:56:00,382 --> 00:56:03,428
[They lost their chance at three hints-
Time to start the second round.]

933
00:56:03,429 --> 00:56:07,026
[Between Suk Jin and Min Soo,
they know quite a few people.]

934
00:56:07,494 --> 00:56:09,814
- Is that your personal phone?
- Min Soo's wearing toe socks.

935
00:56:12,399 --> 00:56:14,380
You didn't see that earlier?

936
00:56:15,139 --> 00:56:17,171
My fantasy has just been shattered!

937
00:56:19,161 --> 00:56:21,681
I can't believe that the Min Soo of my dreams
is wearing toe socks!

938
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:24,738
She was wearing her toe socks the whole time
she was on the drama, 'Sandglass'!

939
00:56:26,072 --> 00:56:27,410
- Spin the wheel.
- Spin it?

940
00:56:27,411 --> 00:56:29,818
- Let's spin it together.
- One, two, three.

941
00:56:34,289 --> 00:56:38,049
[Who will it be this time?
And will they answer their phone?]

942
00:56:42,507 --> 00:56:45,487
If it's someone like Ji Jin Hee,
he and I talk all the time.

943
00:56:47,605 --> 00:56:50,174
- Lee Juk?
- Yoon Ah!

944
00:56:50,175 --> 00:56:52,807
Hong Sang... Kim Sang Kyung.

945
00:56:52,808 --> 00:56:55,791
[Kim Sang Kyung!]

946
00:56:56,812 --> 00:57:00,825
[Debonair actor, Kim Sang Kyung,
who showed off his quiet, but goofy side.]

947
00:57:03,150 --> 00:57:05,215
- Sang Kyung.
- Call Sang Kyung!

948
00:57:06,206 --> 00:57:08,361
- Jung Hwa, what's his number?
- I have his phone number.

949
00:57:08,362 --> 00:57:10,524
- Check and see if I have it.
- Isn't he your junior?

950
00:57:10,525 --> 00:57:12,384
Wait, I think...

951
00:57:12,385 --> 00:57:15,326
[Big-nose checks his contact list...]

952
00:57:15,327 --> 00:57:17,812
[And he doesn't have his number!]

953
00:57:18,634 --> 00:57:22,097
[A total waste of time!
He should've asked others instead.]

954
00:57:22,900 --> 00:57:24,774
- You have it?
- Yes, press the phone.

955
00:57:24,775 --> 00:57:27,016
[Needs to check through the contact list.]

956
00:57:27,017 --> 00:57:29,346
I don't know how to use this
since I don't use an iPhone.

957
00:57:29,347 --> 00:57:31,322
[The older man doesn't know how to use
the latest technology.]

958
00:57:32,749 --> 00:57:37,054
[Old man Big-nose... please hurry.]

959
00:57:37,089 --> 00:57:40,661
- You have to enter his name.
- What is he doing?

960
00:57:42,530 --> 00:57:44,211
Kim Sang Kyung.

961
00:57:44,628 --> 00:57:46,729
[Voice command?]

962
00:57:46,730 --> 00:57:48,724
[All the others are cringing at
his behavior.]

963
00:57:48,725 --> 00:57:50,317
- Here it is.
- I see it.

964
00:57:50,318 --> 00:57:52,101
- Hurry up and call him.
- I see it.

965
00:57:52,102 --> 00:57:53,555
- Press it.
- Press this?

966
00:57:53,908 --> 00:57:56,588
[Finally calling.]

967
00:57:56,589 --> 00:57:59,878
[Why is he... making it so complicated?]

968
00:58:00,361 --> 00:58:03,807
[The phone is finally ringing.]

969
00:58:03,808 --> 00:58:06,847
[If he doesn't answer the call,
they'll fail the second round as well.]

970
00:58:07,702 --> 00:58:09,392
- Speaker.
- We have it on speaker.

971
00:58:09,393 --> 00:58:11,363
<i>What are you saying?

972
00:58:13,020 --> 00:58:16,940
[Oh! He answered!]

973
00:58:20,064 --> 00:58:21,883
Sang Kyung!
Hello?

974
00:58:22,716 --> 00:58:24,460
This is Ji Suk Jin.

975
00:58:24,461 --> 00:58:27,492
- Yes, hello!
- It's been awhile.

976
00:58:27,493 --> 00:58:30,069
- What can I help you with?
- I realized that I don't have your number.

977
00:58:30,070 --> 00:58:32,642
He answered the call.

978
00:58:32,643 --> 00:58:35,198
[Nice Sang Kyung answers the call
on the first ring.]

979
00:58:35,199 --> 00:58:36,854
What is Min Jung doing?

980
00:58:36,855 --> 00:58:38,954
We're filming Running Man right now.

981
00:58:38,955 --> 00:58:41,994
We succeeded because you answered
our call.

982
00:58:41,995 --> 00:58:43,646
[Explaining their mission to him.]

983
00:58:43,647 --> 00:58:45,567
Thanks for answering the call.

984
00:58:45,568 --> 00:58:49,000
<i>Jung Hwa has a movie coming out.

985
00:58:49,529 --> 00:58:52,572
<i>And I noticed that she's gotten
even prettier lately.

986
00:58:52,573 --> 00:58:54,240
- I know.
- Seriously?

987
00:58:54,241 --> 00:58:57,927
[Happy to answer and joke around.]

988
00:58:57,928 --> 00:59:00,127
Thanks, Sang Kyung!

989
00:59:00,804 --> 00:59:06,618
<i>Jung Hwa... since there aren't any
real girly movies out lately...

990
00:59:06,619 --> 00:59:09,776
<i>I really feel that your movie
is going to become a huge hit.

991
00:59:09,777 --> 00:59:11,687
What is he talking about all of a sudden?

992
00:59:12,612 --> 00:59:16,602
[A plug-in about her movie
out of the blue?]

993
00:59:16,921 --> 00:59:20,239
<i>I'm sure that she's on Running Man
because there's a reason for it.

994
00:59:21,024 --> 00:59:24,580
[Witty Sang Kyung is mentioning her movie
in her place to help her out.]

995
00:59:24,867 --> 00:59:27,027
Where are you right now, Sang Kyung?

996
00:59:27,028 --> 00:59:28,491
<i>I'm out drinking.

997
00:59:29,348 --> 00:59:31,979
- At this hour?
- I had a feeling.

998
00:59:31,980 --> 00:59:34,636
[That's way Sang Kyung's sounding so upbeat.]

999
00:59:34,637 --> 00:59:36,681
Okay, thanks so much for your help.

1000
00:59:36,867 --> 00:59:40,273
[Such a relief that he answered their call!]

1001
00:59:40,274 --> 00:59:42,983
[Thank you, Sang Kyung,
for answering the call!]

1002
00:59:42,984 --> 00:59:45,237
[Suk Jin and Min Soo succeed!]

1003
00:59:45,783 --> 00:59:47,856
Wow, this is hard.

1004
00:59:51,128 --> 00:59:54,654
[Ha Ha and So Ri are up next.]

1005
00:59:54,655 --> 00:59:56,583
- That way?
- Should we spin this way?

1006
00:59:56,584 --> 00:59:59,093
Yeah, that way.
I'll spin up.

1007
00:59:59,263 --> 01:00:01,812
How is that any important?

1008
01:00:02,551 --> 01:00:04,711
- Spin down?
- You want to spin up?

1009
01:00:04,712 --> 01:00:06,216
[These two are totally off synch.]

1010
01:00:06,217 --> 01:00:10,267
- Do as you'd like.
- There's no way you two are a match.

1011
01:00:10,885 --> 01:00:12,749
Set, go.

1012
01:00:18,386 --> 01:00:20,969
[Everyone fixes their gaze on the wheel.]

1013
01:00:24,495 --> 01:00:26,476
You might get lucky.
Jang Joon Hwan.

1014
01:00:26,477 --> 01:00:29,796
[If they can get So Ri's husband,
Jang Joon Hwan...]

1015
01:00:29,797 --> 01:00:31,128
No!

1016
01:00:33,220 --> 01:00:36,877
- Go Soo's okay too!
- Go Soo, Won Bin, Kim Tae Hee!

1017
01:00:36,878 --> 01:00:39,575
Lee Juk!
Park Tae Hwan!

1018
01:00:39,576 --> 01:00:41,731
[Park Tae Hwan is chosen.]

1019
01:00:41,732 --> 01:00:43,776
Okay, I know Park Tae Hwan!

1020
01:00:45,740 --> 01:00:47,432
I know Park Tae Hwan.

1021
01:00:47,433 --> 01:00:49,881
[How does he know his number?]

1022
01:00:52,082 --> 01:00:54,889
- I think he's in Australia right now.
- In Australia?

1023
01:00:55,662 --> 01:00:59,368
[He's currently participating in
a swim competition in Australia.]

1024
01:00:59,369 --> 01:01:01,150
Please.

1025
01:01:01,151 --> 01:01:04,103
- Tae Hwan.
- I'd be shocked if he answers the call.

1026
01:01:04,104 --> 01:01:06,548
He's doing really well in Australia
right now.

1027
01:01:07,364 --> 01:01:08,805
What if he's sleeping?

1028
01:01:08,806 --> 01:01:10,698
- He might be swimming.
- What time is it over there right now?

1029
01:01:11,184 --> 01:01:12,868
What if he's in the water?

1030
01:01:13,226 --> 01:01:15,263
Yeah, he could be training.

1031
01:01:17,295 --> 01:01:20,549
[Tae Hwan... it's me.]

1032
01:01:21,427 --> 01:01:24,170
[Marine Boy, Park Tae Hwan-
Visiting RM with a huge smile on his face.]

1033
01:01:24,171 --> 01:01:26,191
Who's name did you want to
rip off the most?

1034
01:01:26,192 --> 01:01:27,424
Yours.

1035
01:01:33,782 --> 01:01:40,339
[You remember, don't you?
We were so happy together.]

1036
01:01:41,873 --> 01:01:45,376
[Please answer the phone.]

1037
01:01:48,156 --> 01:01:49,769
- I don't think he'll answer.
- He answered!

1038
01:01:49,770 --> 01:01:51,017
<i>Hello?

1039
01:01:56,401 --> 01:01:58,991
[Park Tae Hwan answered!]

1040
01:01:59,985 --> 01:02:02,447
[What an honor!]

1041
01:02:02,448 --> 01:02:07,296
Park Tae Hwan!

1042
01:02:07,297 --> 01:02:09,545
Tae Hwan!

1043
01:02:10,195 --> 01:02:12,393
How are you doing, Tae Hwan?

1044
01:02:12,394 --> 01:02:14,322
<i>What... what is it?
What's going on?

1045
01:02:14,323 --> 01:02:17,133
Hey, Tae Hwan.
We're filming Running Man right now.

1046
01:02:17,134 --> 01:02:20,335
Our mission success depended on whether you
answered your phone or not, and you did.

1047
01:02:20,336 --> 01:02:22,010
We succeeded our mission!

1048
01:02:24,235 --> 01:02:28,849
- Are you doing well?
- I just got back from a match.

1049
01:02:29,548 --> 01:02:32,100
- Congratulations, Tae Hwan!
- Congratulations!

1050
01:02:33,736 --> 01:02:36,073
- Thank you.
- We haven't forgotten about you.

1051
01:02:36,074 --> 01:02:38,202
- You have to come back on Running Man.
- When do you want to come back?

1052
01:02:38,203 --> 01:02:41,003
- I'll be back on soon.
- Yeah, come back soon.

1053
01:02:41,004 --> 01:02:43,265
- It's so nice to meet you.
- Yes.

1054
01:02:43,266 --> 01:02:47,183
Moon So Ri is sitting next to me.
Moon So Ri, the actress.

1055
01:02:47,184 --> 01:02:49,839
- Yes, hello.
- Hello!

1056
01:02:51,730 --> 01:02:54,314
[Unable to hide her awe.]

1057
01:02:55,888 --> 01:02:58,495
Thank you so much for answering the call.

1058
01:02:58,496 --> 01:03:00,855
- Thanks, Tae Hwan.
- No problem.

1059
01:03:00,856 --> 01:03:03,240
Make sure to come back on
the show, Tae Hwan.

1060
01:03:03,241 --> 01:03:05,864
- Yes, see you soon.
- Yeah, let's get together for dinner soon.

1061
01:03:05,865 --> 01:03:07,313
- Thanks.
- Stay safe!

1062
01:03:08,077 --> 01:03:12,184
[Hurray, Marine Boy!
Here's a cheer for you!]

1063
01:03:12,185 --> 01:03:14,514
[Ha Ha and So Ri succeed their mission.]

1064
01:03:14,515 --> 01:03:17,676
- We have to make sure to succeed.
- I'm getting nervous.

1065
01:03:17,677 --> 01:03:21,777
- I don't really know anyone.
- We really don't know many people.

1066
01:03:22,532 --> 01:03:24,657
I know all the directors.

1067
01:03:24,658 --> 01:03:28,017
But I don't know any actors.
But I can call any of the directors.

1068
01:03:28,018 --> 01:03:30,361
I hope we get someone like Myung Soo
or Hyung Don.

1069
01:03:30,362 --> 01:03:32,917
- Or even Hong Chul.
- Myung Soo never answers his phone.

1070
01:03:33,979 --> 01:03:35,518
Spin the wheel.

1071
01:03:38,617 --> 01:03:42,234
Come on, please.
We need to pass so we can succeed.

1072
01:03:42,235 --> 01:03:44,183
We have to avoid getting Jackie Chan.

1073
01:03:46,811 --> 01:03:48,772
Soo Hong!

1074
01:03:52,181 --> 01:03:55,086
- Hee Hyul!
- It's Jin Hee.

1075
01:03:55,087 --> 01:03:56,832
It's Jin Hee!

1076
01:03:57,172 --> 01:03:59,012
- It's Jin Hee!
- I have his number!

1077
01:03:59,012 --> 01:04:01,320
- I have his number!
- I have it!

1078
01:04:01,807 --> 01:04:04,544
[Easy Brothers are both
volunteering their phones!]

1079
01:04:06,604 --> 01:04:10,235
[The mission impossible of unlocking
his phone starts up again.]

1080
01:04:10,236 --> 01:04:11,876
Mine's just a diamond pattern!

1081
01:04:13,467 --> 01:04:16,907
[Ace unlocks Kwang Soo's phone right away!]

1082
01:04:16,908 --> 01:04:19,634
- He's not going to answer your call.
- We just talked last week.

1083
01:04:21,372 --> 01:04:24,428
[Calling Ji Jin Hee with Kwang Soo's phone.]

1084
01:04:24,429 --> 01:04:27,388
- He's not going to answer.
- He's in a drama.

1085
01:04:27,389 --> 01:04:31,248
[He may be filming her latest drama...
Will he answer the phone?]

1086
01:04:34,100 --> 01:04:35,567
Jin Hee!

1087
01:04:35,568 --> 01:04:39,107
[Dashing and debonair actor, Ji Jin Hee.]

1088
01:04:40,875 --> 01:04:44,409
[His duck feathered run
is still fresh on our minds...]

1089
01:04:49,770 --> 01:04:51,144
There's still time.

1090
01:04:52,609 --> 01:04:54,106
<i>Hey, Kwang Soo.

1091
01:04:56,182 --> 01:04:58,395
[Hurray!]

1092
01:04:59,946 --> 01:05:03,811
[Jin Hee coolly answers the call.]

1093
01:05:03,812 --> 01:05:05,622
Hello, Sir. This is Kang Gary.
Gary.

1094
01:05:05,623 --> 01:05:08,690
- Oh my goodness... Gary.
- Hi, Jin Hee!

1095
01:05:08,691 --> 01:05:11,884
- Have you been well?
- Yes, I'm doing very well.

1096
01:05:11,885 --> 01:05:15,414
We're filming Running Man right now,
and we succeeded our mission, thanks to you.

1097
01:05:15,415 --> 01:05:17,703
Thank you!

1098
01:05:17,704 --> 01:05:20,821
- Thanks, Jin Hee!
- We love your new drama!

1099
01:05:21,136 --> 01:05:24,162
- So you did okay?
- Yes, we succeeded!

1100
01:05:24,163 --> 01:05:28,234
- Good, congratulations.
- Thanks to you, we'll be able to go on.

1101
01:05:28,664 --> 01:05:30,931
Jin Hee!

1102
01:05:30,932 --> 01:05:33,585
- Yes?
- Are you really close with Suk Jin?

1103
01:05:34,499 --> 01:05:36,935
- Yes, of course we are.
- Seriously?

1104
01:05:37,368 --> 01:05:39,388
Tell everyone how close we are, Jin Hee.

1105
01:05:39,389 --> 01:05:41,672
Yes, we're very close.

1106
01:05:41,673 --> 01:05:43,737
- Yes, that's right.
- What were you doing just now?

1107
01:05:43,738 --> 01:05:47,048
<i>I'm just looking through the
latest script.

1108
01:05:47,049 --> 01:05:49,339
- Thank you, Jin Hee.
- Sure.

1109
01:05:49,340 --> 01:05:52,120
- Thanks, Jin Hee.
- Jin Hee, it's me, Uhm-Tang.

1110

a huge success.

01:06:14,841 --> 01:06:17,019
Fighting, Ji Jin Hee.

1119
01:06:17,020 --> 01:06:18,945
- Thank you!
- His drama is really good.

1120
01:06:18,946 --> 01:06:21,960
- Our voices are going to go hoarse.
- I'm so glad he answered.

1121
01:06:23,220 --> 01:06:25,671
- We may be able to do this.
- We might be able to succeed.

1122

- We may be able to do this.
- One, two, three.

1123
01:06:28,196 --> 01:06:30,101
[Time to pick the fourth caller.
Jae Suk and Kwang Soo's turn.]

1124
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:35,310
It would be so nice if we can get
So Ri's husband.

1125
01:06:51,899 --> 01:06:53,479
Woo Bin?

1126
01:06:53,480 --> 01:06:56,056
[Jung Woo Sung is chosen!]

1127
01:06:57,260 --> 01:07:01,851
[Jung Woo Sung, who ended up being
so much more than a handsome face!]

1128
01:07:01,852 --> 01:07:05,911
[Will he answer their sudden phone call?]

1129
01:07:06,677 --> 01:07:08,989
- I have his phone number!
- You have it?

1130
01:07:08,990 --> 01:07:10,479
- What's your lock code?
- I'm pretty sure I have his number.

1131
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:13,539
- What's your lock code?
- I have his number too. Search my phone.

1132
01:07:14,308 --> 01:07:17,976
I think I have it...
I'm pretty sure that I have it.

1133
01:07:17,977 --> 01:07:19,665
- You don't have it.
- I don't have his number?

1134
01:07:19,666 --> 01:07:22,952
[Searching through Ha Ha's contacts...]

1135
01:07:22,953 --> 01:07:25,539
- You have a 'Woo Sung'.
- Do you see a 'Jung Woo Sung'?

1136
01:07:25,540 --> 01:07:28,628
Should I try calling Kyung Gyu?
I can ask Seo Kyung Gyu for his number.

1137
01:07:30,267 --> 01:07:32,383
- I was told he really likes Running Man.
- I know.

1138
01:07:32,852 --> 01:07:35,526
[Trying Kyung Gyu's phone.]

1139
01:07:36,417 --> 01:07:38,449
Why isn't he answering my call?

1140
01:07:39,541 --> 01:07:41,961
- Hello?
- It's me, So Ri.

1141
01:07:41,962 --> 01:07:47,048
Sorry, but we're in a huge rush.
Can you give me Jung Woo Sung's number?

1142
01:07:47,877 --> 01:07:50,524
- Woo Sung?
- Yeah, Jung Woo Sung. That handsome actor.

1143
01:07:50,666 --> 01:07:54,316
- I'll text you the number.
- There's no time. Can you just tell me now?

1144
01:07:55,125 --> 01:07:58,906
<i>But... I don't think I can memorize it.

1145
01:07:58,907 --> 01:08:01,919
- Okay, just text it to me.
- Let us say 'hi' to him.

1146
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:06,946
- Can my friends say 'hi' first?
- Hello, sir, this is Yoo Jae Suk.

1147
01:08:06,947 --> 01:08:08,407
Hello, this is Lee Kwang Soo.

1148
01:08:08,408 --> 01:08:12,024
- We're filming Running Man right now.
- Ah... Running Man?

1149
01:08:12,025 --> 01:08:13,865
- Yes.
- I see.

1150
01:08:13,866 --> 01:08:16,959
Sorry for this sudden call.

1151
01:08:17,250 --> 01:08:18,904
- Kyung Gyu...
- Why are you asking for Woo Sung's number?

1152
01:08:18,905 --> 01:08:23,785
It's a long story, but to keep it short,
we had to spin the spinning wheel

1153
01:08:23,786 --> 01:08:28,079
and we have to call the celebrity
whose name the wheel landed on.

1154
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:30,750
- Thank you so much.
- And Happy New Year!

1155
01:08:30,751 --> 01:08:35,478
- Yes, Happy New Year to you too.
- Where are you right now?

1156
01:08:36,817 --> 01:08:39,763
[MC Yoo still manages to ask
a question like that at a time like this.]

1157
01:08:39,764 --> 01:08:41,736
Can I ask you what you're doing?
What are you doing?

1158
01:08:41,737 --> 01:08:44,118
- I bet he's out drinking.
- I'm out drinking right now.

1159
01:08:44,879 --> 01:08:46,565
- Thanks!
- Thank you!

1160
01:08:46,566 --> 01:08:48,544
<i>I'll text you the number right now.

1161
01:08:49,536 --> 01:08:51,803
[Kyung Gyu seemed more urgent to get them
the number than Jae Suk himself.]

1162
01:08:51,804 --> 01:08:54,122
- We'll be fine as long as this team...
- There's the text!

1163
01:08:54,123 --> 01:08:56,008
Here, call this number.

1164
01:08:56,515 --> 01:08:59,812
[They just need to call that number now.]

1165
01:09:00,680 --> 01:09:02,365
I don't think he'll answer.

1166
01:09:05,493 --> 01:09:10,680
[Will Jung Woo Sung answer the call...
or will the time be over first?]

1167
01:09:11,641 --> 01:09:15,535
[They'll succeed as soon as he answers!]

1168
01:09:18,127 --> 01:09:20,602
- Just five more seconds.
- Wait!

1169
01:09:26,279 --> 01:09:29,251
Everyone's working right now.
Who would answer their phone?

1170
01:09:29,252 --> 01:09:32,521
This is all such a joke!
All those people have jobs!

1171
01:09:33,285 --> 01:09:36,577
- Min Soo's angry right now.
- It's the truth! All those people work!

1172
01:09:36,578 --> 01:09:39,073
Even housewives can't answer
their phones around this time.

1173
01:09:39,074 --> 01:09:42,284
They're all busy making dinner,
and taking care of their family!

1174
01:09:42,285 --> 01:09:44,281
- You're both doing great!
- They're stating the truth.

1175
01:09:44,282 --> 01:09:48,679
This is everyone's busiest time of the day.
This is asking too much of them.

1176
01:09:49,696 --> 01:09:52,635
We have to start all over for
the third round.

1177
01:09:52,636 --> 01:09:58,063
Do we really have to start all over?
Can't we just keep the successful calls?

1178
01:09:58,064 --> 01:10:00,217
Didn't you say that we could earlier?

1179
01:10:00,218 --> 01:10:02,822
I'm positive you said that we could earlier.

1180
01:10:02,823 --> 01:10:04,640
[We never said...]

1181
01:10:05,141 --> 01:10:08,995
- One more peg, and it would've been Ho Dong.
- We have to go to the third round now.

1182
01:10:08,996 --> 01:10:13,446
- We were so close.
- I don't think the wheel is very fair.

1183
01:10:14,241 --> 01:10:17,627
[Now she's even suspicious about
the fairness of the spinning wheel.]

1184
01:10:17,628 --> 01:10:21,141
One side is heavier than the other.
That's why we keep getting the same side.

1185
01:10:21,142 --> 01:10:23,696
- That's why it keeps going back that way.
- Look at them looking flustered.

1186
01:10:25,990 --> 01:10:28,368
Then we'll give you one special chance.

1187
01:10:28,369 --> 01:10:33,116
Nominate one person to come forward to make
the call, excluding those we've already called.

1188
01:10:33,117 --> 01:10:36,614
- That's how we'll do the third round.
- Thank you.

1189
01:10:36,615 --> 01:10:38,911
- Thank you.
- You're a really nice person.

1190
01:10:41,266 --> 01:10:44,488
What if we have the number, but they don't
answer because they're working?

1191
01:10:44,489 --> 01:10:46,574
There's nothing we can do about that.

1192
01:10:46,575 --> 01:10:49,152
- Then we'll start with whomever is ready.
- We'll go.

1193
01:10:49,153 --> 01:10:52,037
[Ha Ha and So Ri to start off
the third round.]

1194
01:10:53,498 --> 01:10:58,121
[They have a feeling that their
40 year old clubber friend might answer?]

1195
01:10:59,002 --> 01:11:03,490
[Team Ha Ha and So Ri choose Jang Joon Hwan.]

1196
01:11:04,215 --> 01:11:07,219
[So Ri chooses her husband
without any hesitation.]

1197
01:11:07,220 --> 01:11:09,139
The time limit is exactly one minute.

1198
01:11:09,140 --> 01:11:11,111
Set, go.

1199
01:11:12,453 --> 01:11:15,335
[So Ri tries calling her husband.]

1200
01:11:15,336 --> 01:11:18,091
He could be in the shower right now.

1201
01:11:18,092 --> 01:11:20,373
Why would he shower at this hour?

1202
01:11:21,371 --> 01:11:24,743
[Honey...]

1203
01:11:25,173 --> 01:11:29,027
<i>The best asset that your fortune shows...
is your husband.

1204
01:11:29,028 --> 01:11:31,710
[The biggest asset in So Ri's fortune
is none other than her very own husband.]

1205
01:11:31,711 --> 01:11:40,305
[The most precious person in her life...
be good to him.]

1206
01:11:40,306 --> 01:11:44,769
[So please... answer your phone.]

1207
01:11:46,157 --> 01:11:47,897
- Yes?
- Honey.

1208
01:11:49,271 --> 01:11:51,768
[Success!
He answered!]

1209
01:11:51,769 --> 01:11:54,279
It's me... So Ri.

1210
01:11:55,499 --> 01:11:59,019
- Um... thank you.
- Success!

1211
01:11:59,607 --> 01:12:01,011
[A good start to the third round
right from the beginning!]

1212
01:12:01,012 --> 01:12:02,893
I'll put you up on a pedestal from now on.

1213
01:12:02,894 --> 01:12:05,622
- Yes.
- You speak in honorifics to each other?

1214
01:12:05,623 --> 01:12:07,792
- Congratulations.
- Yes, thank you.

1215
01:12:07,793 --> 01:12:12,943
Hello, sir. My name is Ha Ha,
and I'm Moon So Ri's partner today.

1216
01:12:12,944 --> 01:12:15,295
<i>Yes, hello.
It's nice to meet you.

1217
01:12:15,296 --> 01:12:18,277
- Yes, it's great to meet you too.
- I had to hold Ha Ha's hand today.

1218
01:12:18,861 --> 01:12:21,138
<i>Ah... I see.

1219
01:12:23,042 --> 01:12:26,721
[The cute couple still acts jealous
after nine years of marriage.]

1220
01:12:26,722 --> 01:12:28,543
- What are you doing right now?
- You weren't showering, were you?

1221
01:12:29,335 --> 01:12:32,820
- No, I wasn't in the shower.
- Shower later.

1222
01:12:33,754 --> 01:12:36,981
[Seizes his chance to act like a brat
and promote his single.]

1223
01:12:39,026 --> 01:12:40,817
What were you doing when we called?

1224
01:12:40,818 --> 01:12:43,136
<i>I was watching a movie.

1225
01:12:43,746 --> 01:12:47,007
I'm sorry, but we have a member
whose name is Lee Kwang Soo...

1226
01:12:48,057 --> 01:12:50,248
Can you cast Kwang Soo in one of
your movies?

1227
01:12:50,249 --> 01:12:52,008
He doesn't even cast me.

1228
01:12:52,009 --> 01:12:54,082
<i>Ah, Kwang Soo?

1229
01:12:54,083 --> 01:12:55,896
<i>Yes, he's entertaining.

1230
01:12:58,175 --> 01:13:01,579
[Entertaining Kwang Soo.]

1231
01:13:01,963 --> 01:13:05,013
[Please look kindly on our Kwang Soo.]

1232
01:13:05,014 --> 01:13:08,764
- Thank you!
- Thank you, and Happy New Year!

1233
01:13:11,740 --> 01:13:15,990
- Wow... that was great.
- I've never heard his voice before.

1234
01:13:17,054 --> 01:13:19,615
He sounds like he'd have a
great personality.

1235
01:13:19,616 --> 01:13:21,382
He sounds so calm.

1236
01:13:23,019 --> 01:13:24,838
Pick Dong Wook.

1237
01:13:24,839 --> 01:13:26,963
[Gary and Ji Hyo select Lee Dong Wook.]

1238
01:13:30,159 --> 01:13:31,854
Nothing ever happened between
you two, right?

1239
01:13:36,433 --> 01:13:38,634
- Hey, Ji Hyo.
- Hey!

1240
01:13:39,510 --> 01:13:43,309
[Dong Wook answers before
the first ring is even over!]

1241
01:13:43,310 --> 01:13:45,241
Thanks for answering my call.

1242
01:13:45,242 --> 01:13:48,159
- Okay.
- Hey, Dong Wook. It's me, Gary.

1243
01:13:48,160 --> 01:13:52,349
- Hi, Gary.
- It's always the three of us, isn't it?

1244
01:13:54,995 --> 01:13:57,955
- No kidding. Am I getting in the way?
- No, you're not.

1245
01:13:59,913 --> 01:14:04,050
[Jong Kook and Jung Hwa call Go Soo.]

1246
01:14:07,728 --> 01:14:10,188
- I don't have the number.
- Go Soo, is that you?

1247
01:14:10,189 --> 01:14:12,189
<i>Yes, hello.

1248
01:14:13,624 --> 01:14:16,114
[Mr. Capable succeeds in getting
a hold of Go Soo!]

1249
01:14:16,115 --> 01:14:19,036
Thanks for answering the call.
We're filming Running Man right now.

1250
01:14:19,037 --> 01:14:21,670
Thank so much for answering the call.

1251
01:14:23,540 --> 01:14:25,416
You're so handsome.

1252
01:14:26,909 --> 01:14:29,680
[Suk Jin and Min Soo select Kim Hye Soo.]

1253
01:14:31,748 --> 01:14:33,213
<i>Yes?

1254
01:14:33,214 --> 01:14:36,250
Hye Soo... it's me, Jung Min Soo.

1255
01:14:36,251 --> 01:14:37,411
<i>Hi, Min Soo.

1256
01:14:37,412 --> 01:14:41,122
I'm calling you from
Jong Kook's phone right now.

1257
01:14:41,123 --> 01:14:43,853
<i>Ah, I see.
You must be filming Running Man?

1258
01:14:43,854 --> 01:14:46,123
- Yes, I am.
- Happy New Year!

1259
01:14:46,124 --> 01:14:48,602
- Thank you!
- Hope to see you sometime on our show!

1260
01:14:48,603 --> 01:14:52,712
[Even the fourth caller is a success!]

1261
01:14:52,713 --> 01:14:55,987
- I can't believe Hye Soo answered.
- Thanks to her, we're on a winning streak.

1262
01:14:55,988 --> 01:14:58,176
[Now it's all up to Jae Suk and Kwang Soo
to make it a clean sweep.]

1263
01:14:58,177 --> 01:15:00,755
[Jae Suk and Kwang Soo choose
to call Soo Hong.]

1264
01:15:05,513 --> 01:15:08,457
[The time is ticking...]

1265
01:15:08,458 --> 01:15:12,350
[But their clubber buddy isn't answering.]

1266
01:15:12,351 --> 01:15:13,796
I wonder if he's out at a club.

1267
01:15:14,730 --> 01:15:17,024
- People in the variety show industry...
- Let's call someone else.

1268
01:15:17,025 --> 01:15:19,085
- We're going to call someone else.
- Let's call Gong Yoo.

1269
01:15:19,086 --> 01:15:22,807
[Jae Suk and Kwang Soo select
Gong Yoo as their second caller.]

1270
01:15:24,102 --> 01:15:25,903
We have to call him.

1271
01:15:28,645 --> 01:15:34,237
[Gong Yoo isn't answering either...
Only ten seconds left!]

1272
01:15:34,933 --> 01:15:37,909
[Park Myung Soo is their last hope!]

1273
01:15:39,642 --> 01:15:42,304
[Time is almost up!]

1274
01:15:45,811 --> 01:15:47,614
<i>Hello?

1275
01:15:47,615 --> 01:15:50,632
[Succeeds just in the nick of time!]

1276
01:15:52,677 --> 01:15:56,598
[Myung Soo answers their call right away
as if he's been waiting for their call.]

1277
01:15:56,599 --> 01:15:58,541
- He must've been waiting.
- Thank you!

1278
01:15:59,440 --> 01:16:03,718
[A dramatic win.]

1279
01:16:04,754 --> 01:16:06,594
It's me, Myung Soo.

1280
01:16:07,955 --> 01:16:10,310
- Are you filming?
- Yeah, I am. Are you at home?

1281
01:16:11,575 --> 01:16:13,504
<i>Why are you filming without me?

1282
01:16:14,206 --> 01:16:19,162
We would've failed had you not answered.
Thanks for answering our call.

1283
01:16:20,024 --> 01:16:22,051
<i>I should've answered sooner.
Sorry I took so long to answer.

1284
01:16:23,050 --> 01:16:26,653
[Myung Soo is an entertainer
through and through!]

1285
01:16:26,654 --> 01:16:29,078
Anyways, thanks.

1286
01:16:29,580 --> 01:16:33,524
<i>No, not at all. Call me anytime.
Sorry I couldn't answer sooner.

1287
01:16:34,241 --> 01:16:36,359
Hello, Myung Soo.
This is Kwang Soo.

1288
01:16:36,360 --> 01:16:37,906
- Who?
- It's Kwang Soo.

1289
01:16:38,951 --> 01:16:40,912
<i>What about it?

1290
01:16:44,515 --> 01:16:49,219
<i>I've been getting calls from Singapore
ever since I came on Running Man.

1291
01:16:49,220 --> 01:16:50,975
Why would you be getting calls
from Singapore?

1292
01:16:51,411 --> 01:16:53,055
<i>That I'm doing a good job.

1293
01:16:54,882 --> 01:16:57,053
You didn't do well when you were on.

1294
01:16:57,054 --> 01:16:59,429
<i>Tell your producers to have me back on.

1295
01:16:59,430 --> 01:17:02,385
- What do you want me to tell them?
- Fire Ha Ha and hire me in his place.

1296
01:17:03,995 --> 01:17:06,415
Thanks for answering, Myung Soo.
I'll call you back.

1297
01:17:06,416 --> 01:17:08,877
- Okay, have fun.
- Thank you, Myung Soo!

1298
01:17:11,595 --> 01:17:14,764
[Finally succeeds at the third round!]

1299
01:17:14,765 --> 01:17:17,360
- Answered with five seconds left to go.
- I'll give you one hint.

1300
01:17:17,361 --> 01:17:20,479
- Yes, give us at least one.
- This was really hard.

1301
01:17:22,020 --> 01:17:29,074
Can you give us one hint and tell us if any
of the current couples are partners of destiny?

1302
01:17:29,075 --> 01:17:30,965
Can you?
Since we don't have a lot of hints.

1303
01:17:30,966 --> 01:17:34,236
[They all work as a team
during times like these.]

1304
01:17:34,237 --> 01:17:37,049
- Just tell us how many couples there are.
- Can't you just tell us that much?

1305
01:17:37,050 --> 01:17:39,918
If you tell us that there aren't any now,
then we'll really be at a loss.

1306
01:17:39,919 --> 01:17:42,411
I can't tell you how many of you are
the fateful couple right now.

1307
01:17:42,412 --> 01:17:45,849
Actually, that hint is within the hint
that I was going to give you.

1308
01:17:45,850 --> 01:17:49,474
[If they had succeeded their mission,
that would've been one of their hints.]

1309
01:17:49,475 --> 01:17:52,065
So I'll just tell you whether or not
any of the current couples are correct.

1310
01:17:52,256 --> 01:17:56,071
Of the five current couples...

1311
01:17:56,072 --> 01:17:59,913
partners of destiny do exist right now.

1312
01:18:01,469 --> 01:18:04,441
- I think it's those two.
- It's Gary and Ji Hyo.

1313
01:18:04,442 --> 01:18:08,490
[Monday couple, Gary and Ji Hyo,
or Sexy couple, Jong Kook and Jung Hwa.]

1314
01:18:08,491 --> 01:18:09,678
I'm sure that it's Gary and Ji Hyo.

1315
01:18:09,679 --> 01:18:14,210
When you say that the couple exists right now,
then of the current couples...

1316
01:18:14,211 --> 01:18:17,444
you're saying that the partners of destiny
do exist right now?

1317
01:18:17,445 --> 01:18:19,297
There are two correct couples.
Oops!

1318
01:18:19,298 --> 01:18:20,835
Two couples?

1319
01:18:21,401 --> 01:18:23,936
[Oh... how can this be?]

1320
01:18:23,937 --> 01:18:27,334
[The producer accidentally spills
a huge hint!]

1321
01:18:27,335 --> 01:18:30,768
- Gary and Ji Hyo are definitely one of them.
- And those two definitely aren't it.

1322
01:18:30,769 --> 01:18:33,965
[Running Man members are two steps
closer to figuring it out.]

1323
01:18:33,966 --> 01:18:36,403
Knowing that there are two correct couples
right now is a huge hint we've just earned.

1324
01:18:38,550 --> 01:18:44,996
[Ah... Easy Brothers...
The way they failed the first game...]

1325
01:18:44,997 --> 01:18:46,784
<i>Please just allow us love!

1326
01:18:46,785 --> 01:18:56,033
[My fate... handed down from God...]

1327
01:18:56,034 --> 01:18:58,095
[Real couples of destiny
will soon be revealed.]

1328
01:19:09,319 --> 01:19:12,526
[Entering the final location at last.]

1329
01:19:12,527 --> 01:19:14,928
I think they've got something planned.

1330
01:19:14,929 --> 01:19:17,104
- I think we're going to get plunged.
- We're being plunged into water or something.

1331
01:19:17,105 --> 01:19:18,555
Plunged into what?

1332
01:19:18,556 --> 01:19:20,644
[Just what... are they being plunged into?]

1333
01:19:21,183 --> 01:19:25,658
[Specially built... platform of truth.]

1334
01:19:26,674 --> 01:19:29,574
[Get the wrong answer,
and you'll all disappear.]

1335
01:19:29,575 --> 01:19:32,860
- Everyone must return your couple rings.
- Our rings?

1336
01:19:33,456 --> 01:19:37,433
[Return the rings.]

1337
01:19:38,523 --> 01:19:43,259
- Ones that we're sure of...
- Gary and Ji Hyo.

1338
01:19:43,294 --> 01:19:47,719
- And how about the others?
- Jung Hwa and Jong Kook.

1339
01:19:47,720 --> 01:19:51,527
- I'm not so sure about Gary and Ji Hyo.
- They're a sure thing.

1340
01:19:53,101 --> 01:19:55,122
- Shall I give you your final hint?
- Yes.

1341
01:19:55,768 --> 01:19:59,708
[Final hint to help unveil the truth.]

1342
01:20:00,407 --> 01:20:03,152
- Everything is riding on that hint.
- Jae Suk and I...

1343
01:20:06,962 --> 01:20:11,516
<i>[Lee Kwang Soo's possibilities are Jae Suk,
Jong Kook, Ha Ha, Jung Hwa, and Min Soo.]

1344
01:20:11,517 --> 01:20:15,410
- Then who's not on that list?
- Me, Gary, and Ji Hyo.

1345
01:20:15,411 --> 01:20:19,656
The reason why it's not me is when he and I
were partnered up, we weren't counted as one.

1346
01:20:22,918 --> 01:20:25,027
[If the Sexy Couple,
Jong Kook and Jung Hwa are real...]

1347
01:20:25,028 --> 01:20:27,893
[And Monday Couple,
Gary and Ji Hyo are real...]

1348
01:20:27,894 --> 01:20:29,938
[Then Kwang Soo's partner of destiny is...]

1349
01:20:29,939 --> 01:20:32,534
[Either Yoo Jae Suk, Ha Ha, or Jo Min Soo?]

1350
01:20:34,117 --> 01:20:37,688
[Moments earlier, in the picture mission...]

1351
01:20:39,090 --> 01:20:43,989
[They switched partners so that it was
Jae Suk, Suk Jin, and Min Soo, Kwang Soo.]

1352
01:20:51,875 --> 01:20:54,955
Currently... there are three
couples of destiny amongst you.

1353
01:20:54,956 --> 01:21:00,760
[From two couples to three.
That means there's another couple!]

1354
01:21:00,761 --> 01:21:09,976
[Which means, either Suk Jin, Jae Suk,
and Min Soo and Kwang Soo are a couple!]

1355
01:21:11,284 --> 01:21:14,651
- Come stand over here.
- We only swapped out two couples.

1356
01:21:14,652 --> 01:21:17,380
Two of these three couples are right.

1357
01:21:17,381 --> 01:21:19,516
And one of us two couples are correct.

1358
01:21:19,517 --> 01:21:21,284
Right?

1359
01:21:22,762 --> 01:21:24,201
One of you two teams are right.

1360
01:21:24,202 --> 01:21:27,394
Two of you three teams are correct,
and one of our two teams are correct.

1361
01:21:28,305 --> 01:21:32,427
But the hint that we just received about
Kwang Soo's possible matches...

1362
01:21:32,428 --> 01:21:35,780
Of us... I think it's Min Soo and I.

1363
01:21:35,781 --> 01:21:38,583
- But you're not it.
- But I'm not it.

1364
01:21:38,584 --> 01:21:41,442
Which means, you two are it.

1365
01:21:42,249 --> 01:21:46,519
[High possibility that Min Soo and
Kwang Soo could be a pair?]

1366
01:21:46,520 --> 01:21:49,368
So of those three teams,
if those two teams are correct...

1367
01:21:49,369 --> 01:21:53,647
- Then we either have to swap like this...
- Swap this way?

1368
01:21:53,648 --> 01:21:56,629
Or it's this way.
One or the other.

1369
01:21:56,630 --> 01:21:58,935
- I don't think that's right.
- No, you two definitely aren't it.

1370
01:21:58,936 --> 01:22:01,461
This is really making me take
a real close look at everyone.

1371
01:22:03,733 --> 01:22:06,757
- But if those two aren't it...
- I'm positive of those two.

1372
01:22:06,758 --> 01:22:08,829
[A huge problem if the Monday Couple
aren't fated to be...]

1373
01:22:09,210 --> 01:22:11,439
We have to go with our gut feeling.
Nothing else we can do about it.

1374
01:22:11,440 --> 01:22:13,947
This is our final selection
of all the couples.

1375
01:22:13,948 --> 01:22:17,028
- No other ways to go about it.
- Then please swap out the jackets.

1376
01:22:19,747 --> 01:22:24,458
The couple whom you're most certain of...

1377
01:22:24,459 --> 01:22:26,383
Please go up to the platform
and stand all the way to the left.

1378
01:22:26,384 --> 01:22:28,411
Aren't we the most certain couple?

1379
01:22:29,072 --> 01:22:34,864
[Going by the hints they've received,
Min Soo and Kwang Soo may be their best bet.]

1380
01:22:34,865 --> 01:22:38,448
They must be the couple with the highest
known probability of being correct.

1381
01:22:38,449 --> 01:22:41,875
That would mean that those two are most
compatible according to their fortune...

1382
01:22:41,876 --> 01:22:44,193
Do you have an ounce of
shyness about you?

1383
01:22:45,854 --> 01:22:50,293
While we're all standing here talking,
he's trying to get all romantic on her.

1384
01:22:50,294 --> 01:22:52,888
Of all the countless number of
people out there...

1385
01:22:52,889 --> 01:22:55,826
in some ways, we are most compatible
than anyone else out there.

1386
01:22:55,827 --> 01:22:57,883
[Don't you find that amazing, Min Soo?]

1387
01:22:57,884 --> 01:22:59,835
[Of the countless number of
people out there...]

1388
01:22:59,836 --> 01:23:02,210
[We're the most compatible out of them all.]

1389
01:23:02,211 --> 01:23:03,798
You should go on 'We Got Married'.

1390
01:23:06,088 --> 01:23:08,274
[Comedy is definitely
best suited for Kwang Soo?]

1391
01:23:08,845 --> 01:23:10,895
I'm really nervous.
Shall we go up there?

1392
01:23:10,896 --> 01:23:13,874
- You think we're good?
- Hold hands as you go up.

1393
01:23:13,875 --> 01:23:17,713
So those two... we're sure of them, right?

1394
01:23:17,714 --> 01:23:20,055
We have a very high probability of being
the right couple.

1395
01:23:21,239 --> 01:23:23,256
[Even though it's not a
one hundred percent guarantee...]

1396
01:23:23,257 --> 01:23:27,924
[Min Soo and Kwang Soo still
have the highest probability.]

1397
01:23:32,751 --> 01:23:37,568
And the second most sure couple
can now step up onto the platform.

1398
01:23:37,569 --> 01:23:41,202
[Next highest probable couple is,
Jong Kook and Jung Hwa.]

1399
01:23:41,203 --> 01:23:43,005
I'm sure of it, Jong Kook.

1400
01:23:43,802 --> 01:23:46,062
And I think it's us two after them.

1401
01:23:46,775 --> 01:23:49,961
- See? Something doesn't feel right.
- You two have to be it.

1402
01:23:49,962 --> 01:23:51,633
It has to be you two.

1403
01:23:53,450 --> 01:23:55,567
- Yes, we have to be right about this.
- You two are it.

1404
01:23:56,772 --> 01:24:00,611
[Followed by the Monday Couple.]

1405
01:24:02,611 --> 01:24:04,546
It'll be a miracle if we get this right.

1406
01:24:06,311 --> 01:24:09,175
[Fourth couple, Suk Jin and So Ri.]

1407
01:24:13,938 --> 01:24:17,075
[Last couple, Ha Ha and Jae Suk.]

1408
01:24:19,269 --> 01:24:29,112
[Did they... correctly guess...
all the couples?]

1409
01:24:29,113 --> 01:24:31,719
Are you all set?
You're not going to change your minds?

1410
01:24:31,720 --> 01:24:33,858
[No more swapping!]

1411
01:24:33,859 --> 01:24:37,027
We'll start with the first couple.

1412
01:24:37,028 --> 01:24:39,180
[Time to judge the first couple.]

1413
01:24:40,231 --> 01:24:43,293
Confetti will rain down if you have guessed
the first couple correctly.

1414
01:24:43,294 --> 01:24:45,337
Please just allow us to love each other.

1415
01:24:46,491 --> 01:24:51,427
If the first couple is wrong,
then you all will be dunked together.

1416
01:24:54,230 --> 01:24:58,214
- And we will take back your rings.
- We heard you.

1417
01:24:58,215 --> 01:25:00,152
Challenge!

1418
01:25:01,297 --> 01:25:03,049
Okay, let's see if
the first couple is correct.

1419
01:25:05,494 --> 01:25:07,375
The first couple.

1420
01:25:08,044 --> 01:25:13,981
[First couple...]

1421
01:25:13,981 --> 01:25:17,274
[Partners of Destiny!]

1422
01:25:22,530 --> 01:25:24,737
- I knew it.
- My heart's pounding right now.

1423
01:25:27,921 --> 01:25:32,547
The element of water is very strong
between Jo Min Soo and Lee Kwang Soo.

1424
01:25:32,842 --> 01:25:39,258
Lee Kwang Soo has a tree like disposition,
and she has the ability to help him grow.

1425
01:25:39,259 --> 01:25:41,428
That's why they're a great fit together.

1426
01:25:41,429 --> 01:25:43,226
I love you!
Please help me grow.

1427
01:25:43,227 --> 01:25:44,922
Please accept my love!

1428
01:25:45,573 --> 01:25:47,165
I want to continue to grow!

1429
01:25:48,576 --> 01:25:52,411
- Okay, time to check the second couple.
- We have to be correct about this.

1430
01:25:52,412 --> 01:25:54,580
- I'm positive of you two.
- We're the uncertainty.

1431
01:25:54,581 --> 01:25:57,527
[Jong Kook isn't so convinced of
himself and his own partner...]

1432
01:25:57,528 --> 01:25:58,851
Second couple.

1433
01:25:58,852 --> 01:26:00,168
Let's see.

1434
01:26:00,169 --> 01:26:08,033
[Second couple...]

1435
01:26:08,034 --> 01:26:11,210
[Partners of Destiny!]

1436
01:26:16,742 --> 01:26:19,792
- I had no idea, Jung Hwa!
- Jong Kook!

1437
01:26:21,004 --> 01:26:25,133
- You two should just start dating.
- How can two sexy people like us...

1438
01:26:27,671 --> 01:26:31,444
- Just dunk them in the water.
- Give me your number, okay, Jong Kook?

1439
01:26:34,827 --> 01:26:40,605
There are two very solid elements which would
ensure that they would be great in a marriage.

1440
01:26:41,436 --> 01:26:43,217
They would be great together as actors

1441
01:26:43,218 --> 01:26:46,458
and there are a total of three letters
which indicate their great compatibility.

1442
01:26:47,448 --> 01:26:50,624
[That's what you call a
'match made in heaven'.]

1443
01:26:50,625 --> 01:26:52,202
- You two should get married.
- Marry each other.

1444
01:26:53,837 --> 01:26:56,936
[You're my destiny.]

1445
01:26:57,465 --> 01:27:00,242
- Grab him and don't lose him!
- You're my new obsession!

1446
01:27:02,337 --> 01:27:04,243
I'm going to make him mine!

1447
01:27:04,244 --> 01:27:06,423
Jong Kook, you're mine!

1448
01:27:08,900 --> 01:27:12,259
- Okay, the third couple.
- I'm positive about those two.

1449
01:27:12,260 --> 01:27:14,625
- What if they're wrong?
- No reason to worry about that.

1450
01:27:14,626 --> 01:27:18,494
There are no guarantees that
Ji Hyo and Gary are a couple.

1451
01:27:18,495 --> 01:27:21,948
[No solid proof of the Monday Couple.
Just going with their gut feeling.]

1452
01:27:21,949 --> 01:27:25,517
- I'm positive of those two.
- There's no way we're wrong about them.

1453
01:27:26,754 --> 01:27:30,829
[Will Mr. Capable be right?
Is the Monday Couple fated to be together?]

1454
01:27:30,830 --> 01:27:33,499
If we're right about Gary and Ji Hyo,
then I think we'll be able to win.

1455
01:27:33,500 --> 01:27:35,598
- I'm sure of those two.
- There's no proof.

1456
01:27:44,006 --> 01:27:47,422
[The third couple...]

1457
01:27:47,423 --> 01:27:50,445
[Partners of Destiny!]

1458
01:27:53,392 --> 01:27:57,445
[Even the fortune tellers are testifying
the compatibility of the Monday Couple.]

1459
01:27:58,153 --> 01:28:01,027
- You two really should just date.
- Seriously, you guys.

1460
01:28:01,028 --> 01:28:04,149
- Seriously?
- I think your time has finally come, Gary.

1461
01:28:04,150 --> 01:28:06,435
- Are you serious?
- We were shocked ourselves.

1462
01:28:06,436 --> 01:28:07,606
They can't be just a Monday Couple.

1463
01:28:07,607 --> 01:28:12,664
Every fortune teller we've consulted were
in agreement about the two of you.

1464
01:28:12,665 --> 01:28:14,843
- Seriously?
- You two are most compatible.

1465
01:28:14,844 --> 01:28:16,109
What's the reason behind it?

1466
01:28:16,110 --> 01:28:18,893
Those two share a common fate.

1467
01:28:18,894 --> 01:28:20,699
They're extremely compatible together.

1468
01:28:20,700 --> 01:28:24,115
They each possess an element which would
complement each other most favorably.

1469
01:28:24,116 --> 01:28:25,961
They're extremely compatible.

1470
01:28:25,962 --> 01:28:29,430
- I also see a huge amount of wealth...
- We're on a totally different level.

1471
01:28:30,044 --> 01:28:31,998
You guys would have a really
good marriage together.

1472
01:28:31,999 --> 01:28:34,700
- Please link your arms together again.
- This is almost a sure thing now.

1473
01:28:34,701 --> 01:28:38,332
- No, we still don't know.
- The final two!

1474
01:28:38,333 --> 01:28:39,984
This is the final judgment.

1475
01:28:39,985 --> 01:28:42,365
We will reveal the fourth and
the fifth couple simultaneously.

1476
01:28:42,366 --> 01:28:44,976
[Checking the fourth and
the fifth couple simultaneously.]

1477
01:28:46,430 --> 01:28:51,553
Confetti will rain if you're correct,
but if you're wrong, then you will all...

1478
01:28:51,554 --> 01:28:54,459
I really hate this!

1479
01:28:55,041 --> 01:28:58,555
The fourth couple...
Song Ji Hyo, is something wrong?

1480
01:28:58,556 --> 01:29:00,794
It already feels like we're a married couple.

1481
01:29:03,025 --> 01:29:04,865
You two really do look good together.

1482
01:29:06,469 --> 01:29:10,545
Okay, the fourth and the fifth couple.

1483
01:29:10,546 --> 01:29:12,027
Time to check!

1484
01:29:13,311 --> 01:29:16,377
[Having chased after their destinies all day...]

1485
01:29:17,387 --> 01:29:20,244
Okay, the fourth and the fifth couple.

1486
01:29:21,337 --> 01:29:22,503
Time to check!

1487
01:29:23,539 --> 01:29:32,406
[Has destiny...
smiled down upon these couples?]

1488
01:29:45,106 --> 01:29:47,381
[A complete success!]

1489
01:29:50,681 --> 01:29:54,850
[Couldn't let their guards down
not even for a single moment.]

1490
01:29:58,094 --> 01:30:00,584
This is the hardest thing I've had to endure
since having my baby!

1491
01:30:03,829 --> 01:30:05,726
I can't believe it.
How did we get it right?

1492
01:30:05,727 --> 01:30:07,551
[Still unable to believe their win.]

1493
01:30:07,552 --> 01:30:10,616
[To have succeeded with what they had...
They're pretty much masters of the game now.]

1494
01:30:10,617 --> 01:30:15,607
With Ji Suk Jin, and Moon So Ri...
Moon So Ri has a very weak water sign

1495
01:30:15,608 --> 01:30:18,289
and Ji Suk Jin has a very strong water sign.

1496
01:30:18,290 --> 01:30:21,514
These two are able to complement,
and complete each other in that sense.

1497
01:30:21,515 --> 01:30:23,582
We should be friends.

1498
01:30:23,583 --> 01:30:25,845
- Let's be friends.
- I've made a new friend.

1499
01:30:25,846 --> 01:30:29,387
I can see those two amassing a large
amount of wealth together

1500
01:30:29,387 --> 01:30:35,643
and especially in the real estate market
or something of the like.

1501
01:30:37,053 --> 01:30:40,426
- Maybe in our next lifetime.
- You should buy a building together.

1502
01:30:40,427 --> 01:30:44,297
- Let's become good friends.
- I know some good real estate.

1503
01:30:44,298 --> 01:30:47,131
Maybe we should go take a look
at some available land together.

1504
01:30:47,132 --> 01:30:50,613
I'm telling you that I've got
some sense too.

1505
01:30:50,614 --> 01:30:55,077
- He's always up for something.
- I've got a few ideas in mind.

1506
01:30:55,078 --> 01:31:01,156
When it comes to Yoo Jae Suk, and Ha Ha...
most people are compatible in only one way...

1507
01:31:01,157 --> 01:31:05,117
but these two are compatible and
complementary to each other in every way.

1508
01:31:06,836 --> 01:31:09,352
So that's why you're involved in
doing two shows together.

1509
01:31:09,353 --> 01:31:11,530
I'll do ten shows with him if I can.

1510
01:31:11,531 --> 01:31:14,831
And when I take a look at the compatibility of
the Running Man members as a whole

1511
01:31:14,832 --> 01:31:17,140
there's a very strong element of
sheep amongst the group.

1512
01:31:17,141 --> 01:31:22,075
What that means is, they as a whole
are usually bright and uplifting together.

1513
01:31:22,076 --> 01:31:25,431
[Sharing, giving, and receiving a lot of
bright and positive energy to each other.]

1514
01:31:26,703 --> 01:31:29,017
I'm so happy to be taking home the gold again.

1515
01:31:30,120 --> 01:31:33,616
- Hope your movie is a huge success.
- Take the gold home, and Jong Kook home too.

1516
01:31:34,859 --> 01:31:38,243
[Where are you planning on taking him?]

1517
01:31:39,172 --> 01:31:41,810
I'll put it on you.
Where? On that finger?

1518
01:31:43,076 --> 01:31:45,896
- Wow, so pretty.
- It's a perfect fit!

1519
01:31:46,526 --> 01:31:48,746
- Let's wear the couple rings together.
- Okay, fine.

1520
01:31:49,522 --> 01:31:52,492
- He's trying to give them both to me.
- It's a couple ring.

1521
01:31:52,493 --> 01:31:55,896
- Happy New Year, everyone.
- Happy New Year!

1522
01:31:55,897 --> 01:31:58,551
Please show a lot of love to our show
even in the new year!

1523
01:32:00,065 --> 01:32:02,383
- Bye!
- Wishing everyone lots of happiness!

1524
01:32:02,384 --> 01:32:05,344
- Happy New Year!
- Be good to your friends!

1525
01:32:05,345 --> 01:32:07,116
I found a new friend.

1526
01:32:07,117 --> 01:32:09,762
I think I might get married this year.

1527
01:32:10,666 --> 01:32:13,118
- Seriously.
- We really hope that you do.

1528
01:32:13,119 --> 01:32:15,670
- Hope you do get married.
- Age is just a number, everyone.

1529
01:32:17,226 --> 01:32:19,841
Everyone... love can conquer all.

1530
01:32:20,422 --> 01:32:24,142
- To all our viewers...
- Happy New Year!

1531
01:32:24,143 --> 01:32:26,844
[Happy New Year!]
