look for a four. And maybe come back.

No!

50
00:06:00,015 --> 00:06:04,194

- This is Australia.

- Yeah, so what?

83
00:10:03,352 --> 00:10:06,021
- You like clothes like these.
- So what?

84

- Yeah.

90

He looks good.

91

He's the only good looking one.
Hey! Do it again! Roll!

92
00:11:10,026 --> 00:11:12,898
Did you taylor your clothes?
Why do you look so good?

93

They just gave me these.

I got a blouse!

95
00:11:22,047 --> 00:11:26,264
I'm a father to a child but
I still have to wear suspenders.

96

What does being a father have
to do with suspenders?

97
00:11:29,926 --> 00:11:31,963
You've been wearing
Groucho glasses for years!

98
00:11:31,963 --> 00:11:33,596
- This is my nose.
- Is it really?

99
00:11:33,596 --> 00:11:36,333
This one is real.

100
00:11:44,307 --> 00:11:47,125
It's here.

101
00:11:47,453 --> 00:11:49,693
Three stars.

102
00:11:50,632 --> 00:11:53,119
That's not bad.

103
00:11:58,982 --> 00:12:01,289
Only four are left.
Did you find one?

104
00:12:01,289 --> 00:12:02,567
Yeah.

105
00:12:02,989 --> 00:12:05,486
- How many?
- It's a three.

106
00:12:05,566 --> 00:12:07,669
I found one too, but no one
has found a four yet.

107
00:12:08,456 --> 00:12:11,157
- No one?
- No.

108
00:12:12,453 --> 00:12:15,515
I found a two.

109
00:12:17,151 --> 00:12:20,267
But no one has found a four.

110
00:12:20,267 --> 00:12:21,946
They found a three and two twos.

111
00:12:22,606 --> 00:12:24,785
So there's only one three.

112
00:12:25,191 --> 00:12:27,973
But there are two fours.
That's why I'm not leaving.

113
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:39,407
Hey!

114
00:12:39,993 --> 00:12:41,725
I opened it.

115
00:12:44,298 --> 00:12:46,542
It's upside down.

116
00:12:47,875 --> 00:12:50,086
You have to open it.

117
00:13:06,642 --> 00:13:08,299
I got it!

118
00:13:10,876 --> 00:13:14,573
No! Kwang Soo!

119
00:13:15,318 --> 00:13:17,716

00:13:17,716 --> 00:13:22,420
Lee Kwang Soo!
You will pay for this!

121
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:32,900
You have to do it again.

122
00:13:33,546 --> 00:13:38,064
That's no good. Do it again.

123
00:13:39,097 --> 00:13:41,745
Someone did this already? Who?

124
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:44,930
Do it again.

125
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:47,080
I rolled about three times.

126
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,982
Hey friend!

127
00:13:49,321 --> 00:13:50,727
Aren't we friends?

128
00:13:51,986 --> 00:13:53,997
What's wrong with you?

129
00:13:54,603 --> 00:13:57,514
You had no pants to wear?

130
00:13:57,818 --> 00:14:00,053
Isn't that a bit unfitting?

131

132
00:14:06,598 --> 00:14:08,727
Gosh!

133
00:14:11,549 --> 00:14:14,220
- Hear me out.
- I came all the way here to get you.

134
00:14:14,896 --> 00:14:16,555
Try to understand.

135
00:14:16,993 --> 00:14:19,199
I found this three-star one.

136
00:14:19,644 --> 00:14:23,163
He told me that I had to find a
four-star. And then he stole mine.

137
00:14:24,312 --> 00:14:27,422
- Let's team up today.
- I'm a one-star.

138
00:14:27,901 --> 00:14:30,371
It wasn't just him. Ji Hyo...

139
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:33,472
How about this?

140
00:14:33,472 --> 00:14:35,729
<i>[Forces him with the one-star]</i>

141
00:14:43,625 --> 00:14:45,382

142

- Ji Hyo! Not that one!
- No!

143
00:14:56,071 --> 00:14:58,654
- Hey!
- How come you're a one-star?

144
00:15:03,109 --> 00:15:05,261
They both came at the same time.

145
00:15:05,261 --> 00:15:07,004
There was a two-star book.

146
00:15:07,301 --> 00:15:08,522
It was a two.

147
00:15:09,101 --> 00:15:11,706
Ji Hyo! You want to look
at it together?

148
00:15:11,706 --> 00:15:13,973
- Our hands are in it together.
- Together.

149
00:15:13,973 --> 00:15:15,797
- Okay.
- Don't cheat.

150
00:15:16,138 --> 00:15:18,238
Close your eyes for a sec.

151
00:15:21,817 --> 00:15:26,105
One, two, three!

152
00:15:43,984 --> 00:15:46,873
Gary and I shared a two-star.

153
00:15:47,426 --> 00:15:48,948
We looked at it together.

154
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:50,967
Gary couldn't find one.

155
00:15:50,967 --> 00:15:53,020
Howdy Sheriffs.

156
00:15:53,694 --> 00:15:55,116
They are our ranks!

157
00:15:56,273 --> 00:15:58,310
We're sheriffs?

158
00:15:59,169 --> 00:16:03,255
<i>[This is an ancient manor in Australia.]</i>

159
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:09,358
You will have your chance to
increase your rank badges here.

160
00:16:09,883 --> 00:16:11,830
We can increase them?

161
00:16:12,111 --> 00:16:15,256
We will pick the game and the
players to play the game.

162
00:16:15,573 --> 00:16:19,218
The players picked will wage
their star in the duel.

163
00:16:19,694 --> 00:16:21,535
But I only have one.

164
00:16:22,045 --> 00:16:24,121
Having more is a huge advantage.

165
00:16:24,426 --> 00:16:31,416
The sheriffs that are not picked may
bet their stars on who is going to win.

166
00:16:32,914 --> 00:16:34,797
Or we can lose it all.

167
00:16:34,797 --> 00:16:36,570
You don't have to bet if
you don't want to.

168
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:39,212
But if we want to win,
we want to make bets.

169
00:16:40,748 --> 00:16:44,930
When you win, you will receive
double the amount of stars you bet.

170
00:16:45,167 --> 00:16:47,240
You will lose them when you lose.

171
00:16:47,987 --> 00:16:49,548
What should we do
when we have only one?

172
00:16:49,548 --> 00:16:51,886
You have to be cautious.

173
00:16:53,195 --> 00:16:55,661
Isn't that just obvious?

174
00:16:57,019 --> 00:16:59,137
Be cautious?

175
00:17:00,828 --> 00:17:02,645
- What?
- What's your rank?

176
00:17:02,973 --> 00:17:04,965
Make me your deputy.

177
00:17:09,928 --> 00:17:12,462
The games were important.

178
00:17:12,462 --> 00:17:15,774
The first game is Ddak-ji.

179
00:17:17,215 --> 00:17:18,888
I like Ddak-ji.

180
00:17:18,943 --> 00:17:20,614
- The players will be...
- The two hats?

181
00:17:20,987 --> 00:17:22,832
Kim Jong Kook and...

182
00:17:22,832 --> 00:17:24,899
Rain!

183
00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:29,948
Both players will play Ddak-ji.
Who ever flips the other Ddak-ji wins.

184
00:17:30,471 --> 00:17:35,816
Each player will bet their own stars. The
rest of the participants may place their bets.

185
00:17:36,534 --> 00:17:39,212
I don't know how good they are.

186
00:17:39,212 --> 00:17:41,359
The last time I played was
in elementary school.

187
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:44,603
He still plays now.
He even practices at home.

188
00:17:44,603 --> 00:17:48,225
No, I don't know about this.

189
00:17:49,077 --> 00:17:50,719
You have to give me an advantage.

190
00:17:51,183 --> 00:17:54,161
- I don't know how good Rain is.
- Show us how you'd do it.

191
00:17:54,161 --> 00:17:55,387
Show you?

192
00:17:55,717 --> 00:17:57,527
Try it.

193
00:17:59,529 --> 00:18:01,230
He's good.

194
00:18:02,218 --> 00:18:05,938
Ji Hoon bet his only badge.

195
00:18:06,513 --> 00:18:08,873
- It's his last one.
- He's desperate.

196
00:18:09,175 --> 00:18:12,032
- I'm desperate.
- Yes.

197
00:18:12,581 --> 00:18:15,940
Okay! Adios! Rain!

198
00:18:18,623 --> 00:18:21,126
Jong Kook!

199
00:18:21,126 --> 00:18:23,089
Bet on Ji Hoon, he's desperate.

200
00:18:26,315 --> 00:18:28,732
I will bet on Jong Kook.

201
00:18:28,732 --> 00:18:31,490
Kwang Soo!

202
00:18:33,898 --> 00:18:37,016
- This is...
- I thought we had something.

203
00:18:37,346 --> 00:18:38,745
I don't know about this.

204
00:18:38,745 --> 00:18:42,020
- It's okay!
- Then I bet on Jong Kook.

205
00:18:43,852 --> 00:18:45,543
- You said that it was okay.
- Kwang Soo!

206
00:18:46,389 --> 00:18:49,413
- Can I change my mind?
- No.

207
00:18:50,301 --> 00:18:52,814
Jae Suk!

208
00:18:55,755 --> 00:18:58,107
I will show you!

209
00:19:00,621 --> 00:19:03,188
Okay! Okay!
Give him energy.

210
00:19:04,471 --> 00:19:06,718
One game or one out of three?

211
00:19:06,718 --> 00:19:07,780
One game!

212
00:19:08,534 --> 00:19:10,484
- One game?
- Yeah! One game.

213
00:19:10,484 --> 00:19:15,602
Wait! No spreading legs.

214
00:19:16,102 --> 00:19:18,376
Should I play like this then?

215
00:19:19,984 --> 00:19:22,004
Well it is new.

216
00:19:24,424 --> 00:19:26,302
- It's cute!
- Yeah, it looks good.

217
00:19:27,362 --> 00:19:29,253
One two three!

218
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:33,557
You look cute.

219
00:19:34,563 --> 00:19:37,157
Three stars are at stake.

220
00:19:38,217 --> 00:19:39,987
Let's go!

221
00:19:39,987 --> 00:19:43,712
- He's going! He's going!
- Please no. Please.

222
00:19:44,468 --> 00:19:46,452
It won't flip.

223
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:55,324
It's really heavy.

224
00:19:56,810 --> 00:19:58,585
- No pressure.
- No, no.

225
00:19:58,585 --> 00:20:01,302
You have to follow through.

226
00:20:02,291 --> 00:20:04,475
You have to do it quickly.

227
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:19,743
Okay, you almost got it.
Get it next time.

228
00:20:49,998 --> 00:20:52,198
- I should have bet on him!
- Ji Hoon could've gotten him on the next turn.

229
00:20:57,323 --> 00:20:58,915
Why am I so good?

230
00:20:59,557 --> 00:21:01,968
- Rain's star is now taken.
- He no longer has any.

231
00:21:01,968 --> 00:21:05,323
You just need to bet against Jae Suk.

232
00:21:06,408 --> 00:21:07,913
No.

233
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:10,547
I'm betting two this time.

234
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:13,055
What do I do when I no
longer have a star?

235
00:21:13,406 --> 00:21:16,356
Borrow some.

236
00:21:16,356 --> 00:21:19,025
Who made him lose his star?

237
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:21,091
Give me one.

238
00:21:21,091 --> 00:21:23,088
- Then let him borrow yours!
- I only have three.

239
00:21:23,812 --> 00:21:25,821
- Give it.
- It's mine!

240
00:21:26,255 --> 00:21:28,031
Share the wealth.

241
00:21:28,438 --> 00:21:30,680
Do you know how many times
I've lost because of you?

242
00:21:31,635 --> 00:21:34,700
- I will give you this. Pay me back.
- Yes sir.

243
00:21:35,766 --> 00:21:37,797
- Pay me back.
- Yes sir.

244
00:21:38,544 --> 00:21:40,396
Each one of these will be really valuable.

245
00:21:40,414 --> 00:21:42,342
What this time?

246
00:21:42,395 --> 00:21:45,782
This time it will be
Song Ji Hyo vs Gary.

247
00:21:46,719 --> 00:21:48,508
What a tragedy.

248
00:21:48,508 --> 00:21:49,758
They have only one each.

249
00:21:49,758 --> 00:21:52,416
What's going on?

250
00:21:52,416 --> 00:21:55,264
Look how serious Ji Hoon is.

251
00:21:57,739 --> 00:21:59,556
- Is it your last one again?
- Yes sir.

252
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,401
I'm betting along with Ji Hoon.

253
00:22:01,804 --> 00:22:06,256
This one is serving with eyes closed.

254
00:22:08,116 --> 00:22:09,829
He's good at games with eyes closed.

255
00:22:09,917 --> 00:22:14,563
Close your eyes and pour water
in the cup on top of someone's head.

256
00:22:15,153 --> 00:22:17,026
- On my head?
- No.

257
00:22:17,026 --> 00:22:25,100
You will pick a partner. Whoever
pours to the blue line first wins.

258
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:27,814
- Yes sir.
- Ji Hyo is a better choice because she's a girl.

259
00:22:27,814 --> 00:22:29,928
- Gary is good.
- I'm good. I'm really good.

260
00:22:29,928 --> 00:22:33,282
- But you could lose on purpose for her.
- No, because I only have one.

261
00:22:35,435 --> 00:22:37,606
Do you remember how you
got here in the first place?

262
00:22:38,306 --> 00:22:40,324
Sorry, but that's just life.

263
00:22:41,448 --> 00:22:44,233
Okay.
I won't help you next time.

264
00:22:44,233 --> 00:22:45,868
Okay!

265
00:22:46,688 --> 00:22:49,505
- Make your bets!
- Just go against Jae Suk.

266
00:22:50,289 --> 00:22:51,803
Bet against Jae Suk.

267
00:22:52,205 --> 00:22:55,439
- Why me?
- My friends.

268
00:22:55,439 --> 00:22:58,179
You are waiting for me
to make the bets first.

269
00:22:59,018 --> 00:23:00,916
Wait for him. He's good.

270
00:23:03,363 --> 00:23:05,997
- I like Gary.
- No, bet on Ji Hyo.

271
00:23:06,082 --> 00:23:08,320
- Gary.
- No!

272
00:23:09,728 --> 00:23:11,458
Why?

273
00:23:12,424 --> 00:23:15,259
- Song Ji Hyo.
- Jae Suk is really bad at bets.

274
00:23:15,558 --> 00:23:17,049
Song Ji Hyo!

275
00:23:17,985 --> 00:23:20,218
You're all going to fall.

276
00:23:20,218 --> 00:23:22,726
You just won the last game,
so you will lose this one.

277
00:23:24,275 --> 00:23:28,143
Choose on whose head
you will place the glass.

278
00:23:28,143 --> 00:23:31,363
- Choose Kwang Soo!
- Yeah, choose me.

279
00:23:31,363 --> 00:23:35,273
Suk Jin, Jong Kook, and I
bet on Gary.

280
00:23:35,535 --> 00:23:37,501
Jong Kook is good at this stuff.

281
00:23:37,809 --> 00:23:40,611
I could be too much
pressure for him.

282
00:23:40,611 --> 00:23:43,538
No pressure.
I choose you.

283
00:23:46,245 --> 00:23:47,621
Yeah, go for Jong Kook.

284
00:23:47,850 --> 00:23:49,918
I need the pressure to do well.

285
00:23:49,918 --> 00:23:51,329
Yeah, Gary good choice.

286
00:23:51,329 --> 00:23:53,444
It should be Kwang Soo.

287
00:23:54,179 --> 00:23:56,122
- I pick Kim Woo Bin.
- Yeah.

288
00:23:57,892 --> 00:24:00,645
- Why?
- He looks good.

289
00:24:00,645 --> 00:24:03,385
The pressure could
make her do better.

290
00:24:04,007 --> 00:24:05,668
Close your eyes.

291
00:24:06,261 --> 00:24:08,651
Okay. Ji Hyo?

292
00:24:09,064 --> 00:24:10,777
She can't be good at everything.

293
00:24:10,777 --> 00:24:12,787
They are covered.

294
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:18,661
Ready?

295
00:24:19,305 --> 00:24:20,724
Get set.

296
00:24:22,381 --> 00:24:24,093
Go!

297
00:24:31,759 --> 00:24:34,736
Right now.

298
00:24:36,692 --> 00:24:38,566
- Right here.
- Right here?

299
00:24:39,231 --> 00:24:41,317
- Yeah.
- I'm dying.

300
00:24:48,818 --> 00:24:51,897
You can't look Ji Hyo.

301
00:24:55,612 --> 00:24:58,459
- Am I good?
- Okay.

302
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:07,275
Stop! Stop!

303
00:25:07,826 --> 00:25:09,744
I'm out of water.

304
00:25:10,461 --> 00:25:13,108
I can't tell if I'm there or not.

305
00:25:15,768 --> 00:25:17,435
Okay, Song Ji Hyo.

306
00:25:17,910 --> 00:25:22,139
- Okay, Gary.
- He got this. He can do it.

307
00:25:22,139 --> 00:25:24,578
- Okay!
- Gary is good at these things.

308
00:25:24,813 --> 00:25:27,416
Rough! Rough! Go rough!

309
00:25:28,947 --> 00:25:30,674
Rough! Rough!

310
00:25:31,894 --> 00:25:33,220
Rough!

311
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:35,477
You got Ji Hyo.
Just go easy! Easy!

312
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:37,514
Easy!

313
00:25:38,136 --> 00:25:39,681
Ready go!

314
00:26:04,092 --> 00:26:06,837
We won!

315
00:26:16,132 --> 00:26:18,128
- You said rough!
- That's rough?

316
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:23,819
You got it!

317
00:26:25,728 --> 00:26:29,267
- I can get it next time.

318
00:26:32,997 --> 00:26:35,372
I'm so nervous.

319
00:26:36,165 --> 00:26:37,981
I want to win.

320
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:39,977
Ready! Get set go!

321
00:26:52,757 --> 00:26:54,085
You're missing it.

322
00:27:02,123 --> 00:27:04,365
Ji Hyo got angry too.

323
00:27:06,334 --> 00:27:08,105
I didn't get him?

324
00:27:09,334 --> 00:27:11,254
Just go!

325
00:27:11,431 --> 00:27:15,457
Ji Hyo is angry. We're angry.
Everyone is angry.

326
00:27:16,545 --> 00:27:18,201
She got really angry there.

327
00:27:18,719 --> 00:27:21,136
She's got some temper.

328
00:27:22,279 --> 00:27:24,467
Gary, I bet all I have on you.

329
00:27:24,896 --> 00:27:26,844
- You bet everything on me?
- Ready!

330
00:27:28,009 --> 00:27:30,383
- Go!

331
00:27:43,957 --> 00:27:47,440
- You have to stay still.
- Why did you move?

332
00:27:47,665 --> 00:27:48,867
Why move?

333
00:27:48,867 --> 00:27:51,369
You did it on purpose to
get me soaked!

334
00:27:51,369 --> 00:27:53,567
It's like a shower.

335
00:27:57,578 --> 00:28:00,219
Why is this so hard?

336
00:28:01,358 --> 00:28:04,498
I'm going to try something else.

337
00:28:06,066 --> 00:28:08,968
- What is it this time?
- She opened the lid.

338
00:28:11,498 --> 00:28:14,035
Did you really lose your temper?

339
00:28:17,417 --> 00:28:19,210
Should I try this?

340
00:28:19,210 --> 00:28:21,462
No, don't do it.

341
00:28:21,704 --> 00:28:24,110
Don't lose your confidence.

342
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:27,204
- Just do as you were doing.
- Don't lose your confidence.

343
00:28:27,689 --> 00:28:31,647
Ready! Get set...

344
00:28:32,092 --> 00:28:34,001
Go!

345
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:01,415
- Did she do it?
- She got it!

346
00:29:01,415 --> 00:29:03,676
I got it right?

347
00:29:07,697 --> 00:29:09,918
I got it! I got it!

348
00:29:11,198 --> 00:29:13,927
You've got it!

349
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:19,496
They are right.
Betting against me always wins.

350
00:29:20,587 --> 00:29:23,082
Can I bet against myself too?

351
00:29:26,622 --> 00:29:29,247
Ha Ha has six!

352
00:29:29,247 --> 00:29:33,730
This time we will have
Kim Woo Bin and Yoo Jae Suk.

353
00:29:34,266 --> 00:29:40,015
Competing in...
stacking Australian coins.

354
00:29:40,315 --> 00:29:42,586
I'm not good at stacking.

355
00:29:42,586 --> 00:29:48,480
You get to stack 10 to 15.
When the stack falls you lose.

356
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,907
I'm bad at this.

357
00:29:51,224 --> 00:29:53,242
I'm bad at stacking.

358
00:29:53,709 --> 00:29:55,790
I'm going to bet only one.

359
00:29:56,868 --> 00:29:59,961
Bet two! Bet two so that you will
have a sense of responsibility.

361

Fifteen!

362
00:30:07,689 --> 00:30:11,181
Jae Suk has fifteen.

363
00:30:15,726 --> 00:30:18,433
- Good! Good!
- That's our plan.

364
00:30:18,433 --> 00:30:20,499
This is our plan!

365
00:30:23,670 --> 00:30:25,680
That's ten.

366
00:30:25,736 --> 00:30:29,511

- Please tip over.

367
00:30:30,036 --> 00:30:32,040

- What did you say?

376
00:30:59,066 --> 00:31:00,897
He's about to hit him for this.

377
00:31:00,897 --> 00:31:03,972

- Be careful.

383
00:31:30,277 --> 00:31:32,653

00:31:33,251 --> 00:31:34,919
Look at the angle.

385
00:31:34,943 --> 00:31:37,620
If it falls during this turn,
then it's on Jae Suk.

386
00:31:38,509 --> 00:31:40,881
You have to be daring.

387
00:31:41,303 --> 00:31:43,170
Be daring.

388
00:31:43,537 --> 00:31:46,940
Be daring. Just drop it.

389
00:31:47,527 --> 00:31:51,245
- He's shaking.
- Just let it go.

390
00:32:02,952 --> 00:32:04,928
I knew it.

391
00:32:04,928 --> 00:32:07,062
You just have to bet against Jae Suk.

392
00:32:11,515 --> 00:32:12,936
Gary, it's okay.

393
00:32:13,698 --> 00:32:16,130
I told you.

394
00:32:18,605 --> 00:32:20,935
Are you going to start without us then?

395
00:32:21,486 --> 00:32:22,722

I'm sure we can buy more somewhere.

Let's buy some at the
souvenir shop.

399
00:32:29,929 --> 00:32:31,752
Don't worry Gary.

400
00:32:31,752 --> 00:32:34,053
We can buy some out there.

401
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:45,500
What's that?

402
00:32:46,162 --> 00:32:47,476
Look at them.

403
00:32:47,476 --> 00:32:50,083
- They are.
- Wow it looks fun.

404
00:32:51,945 --> 00:32:53,626
Wow.

405
00:32:57,177 --> 00:32:58,914
Where did you get these cars?

406
00:32:59,784 --> 00:33:01,873

- How do you open these doors?

408
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,376
It opens forward.

00:33:13,833 --> 00:33:15,741
Yes! Nice!

-  Yeah, the wind will blow it off.

414
00:33:29,097 --> 00:33:31,077
We start from nothing!

415
00:33:31,077 --> 00:33:34,098
Let's go. Start!

416
00:33:36,127 --> 00:33:38,961

But if that person
takes it off by mistake...

Then one of his stars will
be given to the other person.

533
00:42:15,633 --> 00:42:17,363
- No.
- You don't want to?

534
00:42:17,363 --> 00:42:19,566
Take it off.

535
00:42:20,136 --> 00:42:22,591
Fine then.

536
00:42:24,617 --> 00:42:26,743
Okay! I will let you go.

537
00:42:27,656 --> 00:42:30,499
Me too.

538
00:42:32,241 --> 00:42:34,595
You're the man!

539
00:42:34,595 --> 00:42:36,715
I'm free to go?

540
00:42:39,130 --> 00:42:41,249
Okay take care!

541
00:42:41,265 --> 00:42:43,411
Now that's what I'm talking about!

542
00:42:43,411 --> 00:42:46,803
He's practical and reasonable.

543
00:42:46,803 --> 00:42:50,290
Let's make a living with this.

544
00:42:50,290 --> 00:42:52,547
This isn't bad.

545
00:42:53,037 --> 00:42:55,415
I don't want a miserable death.

546
00:42:56,210 --> 00:42:59,316
I can't ever allow myself... No.

547
00:43:00,634 --> 00:43:02,483
Today is our day.

548
00:43:02,483 --> 00:43:04,764
If we can't win today,
we're just stupid.

549
00:43:05,137 --> 00:43:08,165
- It's Jae Suk.
- Just rip his name tag.

550
00:43:08,165 --> 00:43:10,219
- Come here.
- Okay.

551
00:43:10,219 --> 00:43:13,255
- Everyone, I just finished my mission.
- You don't have any stars?

552
00:43:13,255 --> 00:43:14,925
What?

553
00:43:14,925 --> 00:43:16,466
No, that's not it.

554
00:43:16,466 --> 00:43:17,937
You don't have any?

555
00:43:17,937 --> 00:43:19,942
Please let me finish a mission.

556
00:43:19,942 --> 00:43:21,257
- He doesn't have any.
- No.

557
00:43:21,257 --> 00:43:22,823
We will let you go then.

558
00:43:22,823 --> 00:43:25,389
Okay Sheriff.
Thank you sir.

559
00:43:25,389 --> 00:43:27,610
- You better behave.
- Yes sir.

560
00:43:27,610 --> 00:43:29,679
- I hear a lot of things about you.
- Yes sir!

561
00:43:30,139 --> 00:43:32,158
- Take your glasses off.
- Yes sir!

562
00:43:33,111 --> 00:43:34,961
Sit! Sit!

563
00:43:38,651 --> 00:43:40,576
Sheriff! I think you need to
take charge here.

564
00:43:41,116 --> 00:43:44,520
He is kissing my butt here.

565
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:46,902
I make allegiance to you
and you only sir.

566
00:43:46,902 --> 00:43:49,547
- I would never give in for a six-star.
- Sir!

567
00:43:49,547 --> 00:43:51,278
Can you let this happen?

568
00:43:51,278 --> 00:43:53,561
He just slapped me.

569
00:43:53,561 --> 00:43:55,802
He knows how the ranks work here.

570
00:43:55,802 --> 00:43:58,071
Make me your loyal servant.

571
00:43:59,456 --> 00:44:01,556
You're a young talented man.

572
00:44:01,556 --> 00:44:03,617
I will be your dog for my life!

573
00:44:03,617 --> 00:44:06,147
Look at these fellas.

574
00:44:06,147 --> 00:44:08,670
- Sir, I will go get one star then.
- Okay, go ahead.

575
00:44:08,670 --> 00:44:10,838
- Don't go anywhere else.
- Are you going to let him go?

576
00:44:10,838 --> 00:44:13,169
- Keep going.
- After what he's done to me?

577
00:44:13,169 --> 00:44:14,917
He's my favorite kid.

578
00:44:15,561 --> 00:44:17,925
- Are you disobeying me?
- No sir, I'm sorry sir.

579
00:44:17,925 --> 00:44:19,556
I'm sorry sir.

580
00:44:19,855 --> 00:44:21,727
- I was foolish.
- Don't say that.

581
00:44:21,909 --> 00:44:23,818
- Yes sir.
- He's nice.

582
00:44:24,751 --> 00:44:27,297
Look how he runs away like a girl.

583
00:44:27,297 --> 00:44:31,933
We have to get Jong Kook
the next time we see him.

584
00:44:31,933 --> 00:44:35,161
And Rain... we need to take
out all the strong ones.

585
00:44:35,161 --> 00:44:36,857
We have to get them right now.

586
00:44:39,855 --> 00:44:42,358
I need four stars at least.

587
00:44:44,394 --> 00:44:46,835
I wonder what the mission is.

588
00:44:50,324 --> 00:44:53,127
I have a bad feeling
about going this way.

589
00:44:54,784 --> 00:44:57,197
I should go back that way.

590
00:44:57,197 --> 00:45:00,873
I shouldn't go that way.
Do I have to live like this?

591
00:45:02,483 --> 00:45:04,812
I have to live like a coward.

592
00:45:11,339 --> 00:45:13,643
It's Gary.

593
00:45:13,643 --> 00:45:15,043
- Gary!
- Yeah?

594
00:45:15,043 --> 00:45:17,515
- How many do you have?
- Me too.

595
00:45:18,515 --> 00:45:21,837
Which ones have you tried?
You have two stars!

596
00:45:22,194 --> 00:45:24,056
- I tried the hitting one.
- You have two.

597
00:45:24,056 --> 00:45:25,637
Yes.

598
00:45:25,637 --> 00:45:27,661
- You have three?
- I will collect some and give them to you.

599
00:45:27,661 --> 00:45:29,715
- I will help you.
- Why?

600
00:45:30,055 --> 00:45:32,473
- Anyone can get me right now.
- Yes.

601
00:45:32,473 --> 00:45:33,688
So I will just help you.

602
00:45:34,204 --> 00:45:36,632
Not now. I will get some more.

603
00:45:36,632 --> 00:45:39,512
- Let's go together then.
- Okay.

604
00:45:39,512 --> 00:45:42,873
I can't run. I will help you.
You have my word.

605
00:45:42,873 --> 00:45:44,109
No, it doesn't work like that.

606
00:45:44,109 --> 00:45:45,415
I will give you more!

607
00:45:46,399 --> 00:45:48,700
- Accept it.
- Not now.

608
00:45:49,072 --> 00:45:52,463
I will finish the mission there
and give it to you.

609
00:45:52,463 --> 00:45:53,961
I will give it to you.

610
00:45:53,961 --> 00:45:56,194
You will never win the missions.

611
00:45:56,269 --> 00:45:57,957
I will!

612
00:45:57,957 --> 00:46:02,006
I will give them to you! Really! Hey!

613
00:46:02,006 --> 00:46:03,467
No! Not now!

614
00:46:03,467 --> 00:46:06,813
Hurry! We don't have time.
Just one.

615
00:46:06,813 --> 00:46:10,201
Let's go! It's Gary!

616
00:46:11,285 --> 00:46:16,374
- Give me one at least.
- Not now!

617
00:46:18,907 --> 00:46:21,475
Not now!

618
00:46:22,077 --> 00:46:25,076
It's now!

619
00:46:27,261 --> 00:46:29,786
Aww come on.

620
00:46:33,825 --> 00:46:36,568
<i>[The apex predator]</i>

621
00:46:37,506 --> 00:46:39,706
Hey! I will help you!

622
00:46:46,281 --> 00:46:47,946
See?

623
00:46:47,946 --> 00:46:49,648
We should have teamed up.

624
00:46:50,269 --> 00:46:52,411
How can we team up in this game?

625
00:46:52,411 --> 00:46:54,932
- It should be four stars including Suk Jin's.
- Four stars.

626
00:46:55,048 --> 00:46:56,368
Okay!

627
00:46:56,368 --> 00:46:57,621
How many is that then?

628
00:46:57,621 --> 00:46:59,027
That's a lot.

629
00:46:59,468 --> 00:47:01,692
- I'm going to win today.
- Take Jong Kook's.

630
00:47:02,301 --> 00:47:04,094
I will.

631
00:47:33,866 --> 00:47:35,837
- This is for you.
- Thank you so much!

632
00:47:36,176 --> 00:47:38,137
I got four.

633
00:47:42,922 --> 00:47:45,940
<i>[Take only one can out within
the time limit.]</i>

634
00:47:56,805 --> 00:47:58,282
- Well done.
- Okay! Thank you.

635
00:48:02,268 --> 00:48:05,812
<i>[Wear pedometer and dance to
get it up to 150 within a minute.]</i>

636
00:48:07,537 --> 00:48:09,760
This is so hard.

637
00:48:17,349 --> 00:48:21,765
How can I make it more dance-like
than this?

638
00:48:31,781 --> 00:48:34,426
150.

639
00:48:34,967 --> 00:48:37,188
235, well done!

640
00:48:38,147 --> 00:48:40,087
Okay.

641
00:48:40,097 --> 00:48:42,305
You passed the mission.
I think you passed.

642
00:48:43,464 --> 00:48:45,591
- Okay thank you.
- Thank you.

643
00:48:46,181 --> 00:48:48,133
I have to go. Bye.

644
00:48:50,894 --> 00:48:55,428
I have more stars now but there
are so many people like Kwang Soo.

645
00:48:55,428 --> 00:48:57,019
And Ha Ha has a lot.

646
00:48:57,432 --> 00:49:00,584
If they work together, they can get me.

647
00:49:00,584 --> 00:49:02,795
Even if they didn't
they could still get me right?

648
00:49:10,284 --> 00:49:12,858
Ha Ha, we need to go take out
Jong Kook or Ji Hyo.

649
00:49:12,858 --> 00:49:15,464
- Let's take it off right now.
- When we can.

650
00:49:15,464 --> 00:49:20,096
You and I should get Ji Hyo and
then work our way up to Ji Hoon.

651
00:49:20,100 --> 00:49:23,394
She's probably in there. You know
this is our one and only chance.

652
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:27,163
- Oh! You have two now.
- Sir yes sir!

653
00:49:28,612 --> 00:49:30,922
- Nothing wrong sir
- Good.

654
00:49:31,442 --> 00:49:34,303
Come here.
What were you doing here?

655
00:49:34,303 --> 00:49:36,306
Were you doing your mission?

656
00:49:36,647 --> 00:49:39,664
I'm almost at the same level.
Do I not deserve your respect?

657
00:49:39,664 --> 00:49:42,294
Same level?

658
00:49:42,713 --> 00:49:44,777
Same level?

659
00:49:45,089 --> 00:49:47,182
- How dare you to say that?
- This is why I like him.

660
00:49:47,182 --> 00:49:49,972
- This is mutiny! Can you believe this?
- How dare you!

661
00:49:50,259 --> 00:49:52,159
Don't you have eyes?

662
00:49:52,411 --> 00:49:54,485
Come here.

663
00:49:56,428 --> 00:49:58,821
- You're getting on my nerves.
- Come on.

664
00:49:58,821 --> 00:50:00,177
You're getting on my nerves.

665
00:50:00,426 --> 00:50:02,344
Hey! You don't need to do that.

666
00:50:02,344 --> 00:50:04,569
Sheriff! You're going to let him do that?

667
00:50:04,569 --> 00:50:06,965
- Sir yes sir!
- Good, good.

668
00:50:06,965 --> 00:50:09,242
- The mission over there is nice.
- Yes sir!

669
00:50:09,242 --> 00:50:11,339
- Go there.
- Yes sir!

670
00:50:11,660 --> 00:50:14,061
Okay, you can go.

671
00:50:14,061 --> 00:50:16,358
- I can't believe this.
- What are you looking at?

672
00:50:16,737 --> 00:50:18,617
- What?
- What are you looking at?

673
00:50:18,617 --> 00:50:21,267
Stop! Stop!

674
00:50:21,267 --> 00:50:23,021
- I'm just going to...
- Just go back in.

675
00:50:23,337 --> 00:50:26,545
- He's defying the order!
- Let him go.

676
00:50:26,545 --> 00:50:29,253
- Okay?
- Deputy Lee!

677
00:50:29,639 --> 00:50:31,780
Are you filming The Wizard of Oz?

678
00:50:31,780 --> 00:50:33,666
Will you just go?

679
00:50:34,363 --> 00:50:36,928
I can't stand this anymore.

680
00:50:40,703 --> 00:50:42,647
Geez.

681
00:50:43,302 --> 00:50:46,711
Take him out.
Take him out when you see him.

682
00:50:50,949 --> 00:50:53,895
Taking out people will be faster.
Missions will take forever.

683
00:50:55,931 --> 00:50:57,867
Hey! How many does he have?

684
00:50:58,209 --> 00:51:00,104
- He's the apex.
- Look who's here.

685
00:51:00,379 --> 00:51:02,895
Sir yes sir!

686
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:05,847
Sir yes sir!
How many is that?

687
00:51:05,847 --> 00:51:09,103
- I have too many to even count.
- I got your back sir.

688
00:51:09,933 --> 00:51:12,278
I'm not a concern to you sir.

689
00:51:12,948 --> 00:51:14,923
Me neither.

690
00:51:15,093 --> 00:51:16,851
I'm a nobody.
One, two, three...

691
00:51:17,274 --> 00:51:20,857
Who do you think you're touching?

692
00:51:21,122 --> 00:51:24,490
There's Yoo Jae Suk over there.

693
00:51:24,490 --> 00:51:26,158
Not me yet.

694
00:51:26,158 --> 00:51:29,493
You can take him.
Not me yet.

695
00:51:29,493 --> 00:51:35,341
Because if Gary and Suk Jin...

696
00:51:35,341 --> 00:51:37,161
I already got them.

697
00:51:37,161 --> 00:51:39,257
You're truly the king.

698
00:51:39,257 --> 00:51:41,217
I guess Kwang Soo is next.

699
00:51:41,217 --> 00:51:44,957
Us three. Us three.

700
00:51:44,957 --> 00:51:48,059
What about Jong Kook and Rain?

701
00:51:48,525 --> 00:51:50,393
- Give us one chance.
- We will take care of it.

702
00:51:50,393 --> 00:51:52,393
- Give us one more chance.
- If I see you again, I will take it off.

703
00:51:52,393 --> 00:51:53,970
Yes sir.

704
00:51:54,623 --> 00:51:56,688
I will crawl like an ant.

705
00:51:58,761 --> 00:52:01,152
- What about you?
- I will stick to the ground like a piece of gum.

706
00:52:01,152 --> 00:52:02,370
Low.

707
00:52:02,370 --> 00:52:05,178
- You sound trustworthy.
- Take good care sir!

708
00:52:09,563 --> 00:52:12,472
What a beautiful world.

709
00:52:18,390 --> 00:52:21,537
The world is upside down.

710
00:52:23,275 --> 00:52:25,613
He's still here.

711
00:52:27,004 --> 00:52:30,399
That young'n!

712
00:52:30,653 --> 00:52:32,116
We should have gotten rid
of him when he was a lad.

713
00:52:32,116 --> 00:52:35,556
The world is going backwards.

714
00:52:35,556 --> 00:52:37,796
They say power corrupts people.

715
00:52:37,796 --> 00:52:40,504
He has no respect for his seniors.

716
00:52:42,103 --> 00:52:44,504
Look at his arrogant face.

717
00:52:44,504 --> 00:52:49,146
That young fella! Him!

718
00:52:50,006 --> 00:52:52,672
He's been an Heir since he was a lad.

719
00:52:52,672 --> 00:52:54,423
I've heard of it too sir.

720
00:52:54,423 --> 00:52:57,402
He's just...

721
00:52:58,210 --> 00:53:00,979
Right in front of the wood-splitting.

722
00:53:04,937 --> 00:53:07,250
You promised!

723
00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:10,152
Let me go do wood splitting real quick.

724
00:53:10,152 --> 00:53:13,582
Then before you go...

725
00:53:14,454 --> 00:53:16,554
- Okay.
- Then I won't get you.

726
00:53:18,690 --> 00:53:20,778
Here.

727
00:53:20,778 --> 00:53:22,767
Let me do the wood splitting.

728
00:53:22,767 --> 00:53:24,833
I'm giving you time because
you like it so much.

729
00:53:26,209 --> 00:53:31,413
Just one please! You're like school
bullies robbing pocket change.

730
00:53:31,413 --> 00:53:34,492
- Just one for now!
- You can go.

731
00:53:35,073 --> 00:53:36,751
Is it him or me? Choose.
[Kwang Soo's stars = Ha Ha's stars]

732
00:53:36,751 --> 00:53:40,409
No, it's not that. Let me finish
this one then. Wait here.

733
00:53:40,409 --> 00:53:42,074
Wait right here.

734
00:53:42,074 --> 00:53:44,535
- Let him go, buddy.
- Buddy?

735
00:53:44,948 --> 00:53:46,918
- Buddy?
- How many stars do you have?

736
00:53:46,918 --> 00:53:50,075
Hey! You need to give me one too!

737
00:53:50,883 --> 00:53:53,007
Run! Run!

738
00:53:53,321 --> 00:53:55,090
What's going on?

739
00:53:55,370 --> 00:53:57,588
What? How many do you have?

740
00:53:58,003 --> 00:54:00,381
- This is driving me nuts.
- Let's just go.

741
00:54:00,381 --> 00:54:01,795
Let's go!

742
00:54:01,795 --> 00:54:05,526
- I can't believe this.
- Let's go!

743
00:54:06,555 --> 00:54:09,283
What is this?

744
00:54:09,604 --> 00:54:12,098
It's right here.

745
00:54:13,055 --> 00:54:16,944
It's alluvial gold.

746
00:54:18,234 --> 00:54:22,017
They are washing alluvial gold.

747
00:54:26,562 --> 00:54:29,687
- You have three minutes.
- Three minutes, okay.

748
00:54:31,937 --> 00:54:34,088
Gosh.

749
00:54:44,715 --> 00:54:46,828
Half way!

750
00:54:48,597 --> 00:54:50,221
Geez.

751
00:54:52,113 --> 00:54:54,234
This isn't easy.

752
00:55:00,404 --> 00:55:01,573
No?

753
00:55:22,169 --> 00:55:24,889
What exactly am I doing right now?

754
00:55:24,889 --> 00:55:28,161
What am I doing?

755
00:55:29,363 --> 00:55:33,362
I can win this much gold if I win...

756
00:55:47,446 --> 00:55:49,206
Okay, let's have a look.

757
00:55:51,093 --> 00:55:52,452
No?

758
00:55:53,862 --> 00:55:55,566
Tiny tiny little ones, sir.

759
00:55:56,097 --> 00:55:57,697
Very tiny little ones.

760
00:55:57,697 --> 00:56:00,542
Here!

761
00:56:00,919 --> 00:56:03,654
- Very tiny! Very small.
- Here here.

762
00:56:03,654 --> 00:56:05,070
It's here.

763
00:56:05,070 --> 00:56:07,016
You need a microscope for this.

764
00:56:08,048 --> 00:56:11,768
Here, gold. Gold.

765
00:56:12,574 --> 00:56:14,843
- Cool!
- Cool? Yeah.

766
00:56:15,322 --> 00:56:17,227
Gold.

767
00:56:17,227 --> 00:56:19,602
- One dot.
- Yeah!

768
00:56:20,169 --> 00:56:21,671
Did you see it?

769
00:56:21,956 --> 00:56:25,109
Geez. They just confirmed it for you.

770
00:56:25,509 --> 00:56:28,383
Gold gold gold.

771
00:56:29,341 --> 00:56:31,510
- Oh cool.
- Cool.

772
00:56:32,036 --> 00:56:34,469
Here we go.
That one?

773
00:56:39,940 --> 00:56:42,211
- See? It's in here.
- Here?

774
00:56:42,211 --> 00:56:44,605
Yay! Little tiny bit of gold!

775
00:56:45,910 --> 00:56:48,139
Where is it?

776
00:56:48,139 --> 00:56:50,843
Oh! It's right here.

777
00:56:51,578 --> 00:56:54,069
- Okay thank you.
- Congratulations.

778
00:56:54,069 --> 00:56:55,795
Thank you very much.

779
00:56:55,795 --> 00:56:58,366
Do I get a star?

780
00:56:58,366 --> 00:57:01,992
You have found gold.
Congratulations.

781
00:57:01,992 --> 00:57:03,209
Thank you.

782
00:57:04,104 --> 00:57:05,878
Okay!

783
00:57:06,792 --> 00:57:09,239
<i>[A scroll instead of a star?]</i>

784
00:57:16,801 --> 00:57:18,654
- I want it.
- Yeah okay!

785
00:57:22,689 --> 00:57:25,488
They like it. Bye!

786
00:57:25,488 --> 00:57:27,164
Bye!

787
00:57:36,907 --> 00:57:39,371
What is this? Huh?

788
00:57:40,794 --> 00:57:42,913
- What's this?
- This is a map sir.

789
00:57:43,676 --> 00:57:45,860
That's a treasure map.

790
00:57:45,860 --> 00:57:48,835
That's the Running Hill.
That's where the treasure is.

791
00:57:48,835 --> 00:57:50,472
Oh really?

792
00:57:50,884 --> 00:57:52,396
Right now sir,
we're down here.

793
00:57:52,396 --> 00:57:55,506
Here. Up or down?

794
00:57:55,506 --> 00:57:57,782
No, that's for you!

795
00:57:58,401 --> 00:58:00,583
- Oh cruel.
- What's your name?

796
00:58:00,583 --> 00:58:03,666
My name? Mr. Yoo.

797
00:58:03,666 --> 00:58:05,262
- I like that.
- Mr. Yoo?

798
00:58:05,262 --> 00:58:06,753
Yeah, Mr. Yoo.

799
00:58:06,753 --> 00:58:08,240
And you! What's your name?

800
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:11,436
- Karkar.
- Karkar.

801
00:58:11,871 --> 00:58:15,446
- My name is Jess.
- Jess! Okay, nice to meet you.

802
00:58:15,446 --> 00:58:18,287
Nice to meet you. Bye thank you!

803
00:58:20,276 --> 00:58:23,032
Bye bye! Have fun!

804
00:58:25,067 --> 00:58:27,131
Bye, bye.

805
00:58:27,464 --> 00:58:31,458
The Australian girls like me.

806
00:58:31,458 --> 00:58:33,582
Bye, bye.

807
00:58:35,589 --> 00:58:37,334
Bye!

808
00:58:37,657 --> 00:58:39,625
I feel like I'm leaving
the fairy land.

809
00:58:40,734 --> 00:58:43,890
They are so cute.
Where is this leading to?

810
00:58:47,759 --> 00:58:50,330
Is there a quiet place?

811
00:58:51,509 --> 00:58:53,980
What is this?

812
00:58:54,936 --> 00:58:57,186
Where is this? Huh?

813
00:59:00,108 --> 00:59:01,981
Isn't this this?

814
00:59:02,620 --> 00:59:06,445
That's where I am.

815
00:59:07,264 --> 00:59:09,456
Is this the right place?

816
00:59:10,330 --> 00:59:12,218
I think it's this place.

817
00:59:12,842 --> 00:59:14,869
What is this?

818
00:59:16,888 --> 00:59:18,769
- Excuse me.
- Yep.

819
00:59:18,769 --> 00:59:22,655
Uhh... mission?

820
00:59:26,560 --> 00:59:29,800
- Is this here?
- Yeah, but you're gonna go underground.

821
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:32,642
Underground?
Yeah yeah, okay thank you.

822
00:59:36,535 --> 00:59:38,236
Can you show him the way
to the underground?

823
00:59:38,685 --> 00:59:41,110
Okay thank you.

824
00:59:44,984 --> 00:59:47,223
What is this? Huh?

825
00:59:47,539 --> 00:59:50,948
I feel like I'm going to the magic land.

826
00:59:52,549 --> 00:59:54,908
Okay, thank you.

827
00:59:59,061 --> 01:00:02,031
This is going underground.

828
01:00:09,195 --> 01:00:11,204
Woo Bin! I'm here.

829
01:00:11,204 --> 01:00:13,769
Kwang Soo and Ha Ha are over there.

830
01:00:13,769 --> 01:00:15,513
I will take them out the next time
I see them.

831
01:00:15,513 --> 01:00:17,594
Oh yeah? Can you just take them
out right now?

832
01:00:17,594 --> 01:00:19,988
- Okay I will.
- They took one of mine again!

833
01:00:20,638 --> 01:00:22,268
- They took yours?
- Yeah.

834
01:00:22,929 --> 01:00:26,282
It's like when I take your tag off.

835
01:00:26,542 --> 01:00:28,058
Then I will have to give one to you.

836
01:00:28,058 --> 01:00:30,958
Then... do you want me to
give you one?

837
01:00:31,591 --> 01:00:32,834
- No.
- You're good?

838
01:00:32,834 --> 01:00:34,264
- You'd rather take them all later?
- Yes.

839
01:00:34,264 --> 01:00:35,900
Okay then.

840
01:00:35,900 --> 01:00:37,622
You have more than Kwang Soo?

841
01:00:37,622 --> 01:00:39,404
Of course.

842
01:00:39,404 --> 01:00:41,506
- Then take him out. He's a threat.
- I will be back.

843
01:00:41,506 --> 01:00:43,210
You have to take him out.
You want me to take Kwang Soo with you?

844
01:00:43,210 --> 01:00:46,272
The world couldn't be more beautiful.

845
01:00:46,584 --> 01:00:48,541
I will go get him for you.

846
01:00:48,541 --> 01:00:51,122
Let's take out Kwang Soo.
That's good enough for me.

847
01:00:52,951 --> 01:00:55,978
Kwang Soo was so polite every
time I saw him. I felt so bad.

848
01:01:01,851 --> 01:01:03,643
Go!

849
01:01:13,938 --> 01:01:15,752
I'm sorry.

850
01:01:29,056 --> 01:01:32,684
I need to get this.
Today is the day!

851
01:01:36,448 --> 01:01:37,836
Ran out of time!

852
01:01:37,836 --> 01:01:40,064
Okay! One more.

853
01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:45,250
- Last!
- One more okay.

854
01:02:02,144 --> 01:02:03,928
Super power.

855
01:02:05,864 --> 01:02:07,744
Thank you sir.

856
01:02:08,301 --> 01:02:10,663
I got nine.

857
01:02:13,150 --> 01:02:15,629
Over there!

858
01:02:15,688 --> 01:02:18,585
- Wait.
- Where did Kwang Soo go?

859
01:02:18,585 --> 01:02:20,874
He must be doing the missions right now.

860
01:02:24,227 --> 01:02:27,195
They didn't see me.

861
01:02:28,161 --> 01:02:30,052
When did he join him?

862
01:02:30,401 --> 01:02:32,282
It's Ha Ha.

863
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:35,976
Sir yes sir!

864
01:02:36,269 --> 01:02:38,389
Sir yes sir!

865
01:02:42,957 --> 01:02:44,525
He's running away.
He went that way.

866
01:02:44,525 --> 01:02:46,835
You want me to get him?
From the other way?

867
01:02:46,835 --> 01:02:49,450
He went the other way.

868
01:02:50,035 --> 01:02:51,773
Go! Go see if he went that way.

869
01:02:51,773 --> 01:02:52,928
Okay.

870
01:03:04,127 --> 01:03:06,880
Sir yes sir!

871
01:03:07,348 --> 01:03:09,443
I won't take it off. I won't.

872
01:03:09,989 --> 01:03:13,165
- Where is Kwang Soo?
- He's doing the whipping mission.

873
01:03:13,165 --> 01:03:15,148
- Whipping.
- How many does he have?

874
01:03:15,148 --> 01:03:17,323
He has eight. You can just...
Wow how many do you have sir?

875
01:03:17,323 --> 01:03:21,447
Hey you know he took
all the stars from me.

876
01:03:22,379 --> 01:03:24,448
- I did not.
- I think it's time to eliminate him.

877
01:03:25,164 --> 01:03:27,575
- Sir! Sir!
- Don't get weak.

878
01:03:27,575 --> 01:03:30,548
Wait!

879
01:03:35,503 --> 01:03:38,219
- Thank you.
- Let's go get the giraffe.

880
01:03:52,461 --> 01:03:53,926
Huh? How?

881
01:03:55,383 --> 01:03:58,397
He had so many stars, how?

882
01:04:00,586 --> 01:04:03,010
Geez. Good for him.

883
01:04:05,206 --> 01:04:08,037
That's power.

884
01:04:08,439 --> 01:04:12,687
He deserved it for abusing his power.

885
01:04:19,748 --> 01:04:22,731
What is this?

886
01:04:23,700 --> 01:04:26,045
Okay thank you.

887
01:04:26,368 --> 01:04:28,792
What is this?

888
01:04:32,920 --> 01:04:35,946
It's going underground.

889
01:04:38,740 --> 01:04:41,932
What is this? It's chilly.

890
01:04:45,332 --> 01:04:47,221
It's scary.

891
01:04:48,769 --> 01:04:50,810
It's hot outside, but it's chilly in here.

892
01:04:54,128 --> 01:04:57,960
How far is this going?

893
01:05:00,052 --> 01:05:02,004
The lights went on.

894
01:05:04,679 --> 01:05:07,363
Okay thank you!

895
01:05:10,801 --> 01:05:12,378
There?

896
01:05:13,079 --> 01:05:16,039
This is like Indiana Jones.

897
01:05:17,436 --> 01:05:20,739
It goes in so far.

898
01:05:38,269 --> 01:05:41,841
What is this?

899
01:05:53,659 --> 01:05:56,913
<i>[Red glittering star badge?]</i>

900
01:05:59,157 --> 01:06:01,375
What is this?

901
01:06:02,814 --> 01:06:05,106
<i>The One Badge.</i>

902
01:06:09,532 --> 01:06:12,545
- It's the One Badge.
- What?

903
01:06:12,545 --> 01:06:18,104
Anyone with the One Badge may rip off

904
01:06:18,104 --> 01:06:21,929
name tags regardless of
the star-count for 10 minutes.

905
01:06:21,929 --> 01:06:23,852
- 10 minutes?
- 10 minutes.

906
01:06:23,852 --> 01:06:28,137
You may wear it now, or
you may wear it later.

907
01:06:28,902 --> 01:06:30,981
The duration is 10 minutes.

908
01:06:30,981 --> 01:06:33,557
- Just 10 minutes?
- You can't give it to others.

909
01:06:34,212 --> 01:06:36,694
I don't die even if I
get my name tag taken?

910
01:06:36,694 --> 01:06:38,723
Wow.

911
01:06:39,409 --> 01:06:41,165
One thing is for sure.

912
01:06:41,662 --> 01:06:43,749
I'm going to use this badge...

913
01:06:44,034 --> 01:06:46,999
to take out Lee Kwang Soo.

914
01:06:46,999 --> 01:06:50,831
Lee Kwang Soo!
I'm going to get you.

915
01:06:52,768 --> 01:06:55,232
It's going to be a mess
when I get out there.

916
01:06:55,232 --> 01:06:58,094
I'm going to get Lee Kwang Soo first.

917
01:07:00,401 --> 01:07:02,127
Watch!

918
01:07:02,450 --> 01:07:04,290
The One Badge!

919
01:07:04,290 --> 01:07:09,330
It's only ten minutes. Lee Kwang Soo!
You have humiliated me.

920
01:07:09,622 --> 01:07:11,614
I will get you.

921
01:07:11,614 --> 01:07:15,731
You act like you're mighty because
you have a few more badges?

922
01:07:16,244 --> 01:07:18,181
Just watch.

923
01:07:19,296 --> 01:07:21,884
I will finish you.

924
01:07:31,464 --> 01:07:34,412
<i>The One Badge has been found.</i>

925
01:07:34,659 --> 01:07:37,821
<i>The One Badge has been found.</i>

926
01:07:37,821 --> 01:07:39,546
What's that? The One Badge?

927
01:07:39,546 --> 01:07:42,591
The person with the One Badge
can take out anyone.

928
01:07:43,934 --> 01:07:45,909
There was the One Badge?

929
01:07:47,095 --> 01:07:48,640
Dang.

930
01:07:49,196 --> 01:07:50,756
I knew it.

931
01:07:50,756 --> 01:07:54,376
I didn't think I could win so easily.

932
01:07:55,505 --> 01:07:57,660
There's got to be a time limit.

933
01:07:57,660 --> 01:08:02,864
I don't have to run into him
and lose my name tag.

934
01:08:02,864 --> 01:08:04,960
That will be just heart breaking.

935
01:08:05,538 --> 01:08:09,006
I should just hide then.
All I've got is time.

936
01:08:11,342 --> 01:08:13,340
Australia shooting is so hard.

937
01:08:13,340 --> 01:08:15,561
The can is light.

938
01:08:15,850 --> 01:08:18,248
- How did you have...
- Huh? Ji Hoon!

939
01:08:18,248 --> 01:08:19,422
You were taken out?

940
01:08:19,422 --> 01:08:20,807
- Yes.
- How?

941
01:08:21,173 --> 01:08:24,528
- I was betrayed by Kwang Soo.
- Again?

942
01:08:26,122 --> 01:08:28,346
- You have to tell me when someone is here.
- Okay.

943
01:08:28,346 --> 01:08:30,300
I can't take yours off anyway.

944
01:08:30,300 --> 01:08:32,170
Grab his arms.

945
01:08:32,170 --> 01:08:33,986
And I will be loyal to you.

946
01:08:33,986 --> 01:08:36,907
I told you two days ago
that I will not betray you.

947
01:08:36,907 --> 01:08:38,640
Okay okay.

948
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:40,699
You want me to stay with you then?

949
01:08:40,699 --> 01:08:42,643
- That's a good idea.
- Okay.

950
01:08:42,946 --> 01:08:45,283
- Ha Ha disappeared all of the sudden.
- Hey.

951
01:08:56,592 --> 01:08:58,537
He's just...

952
01:08:58,537 --> 01:08:59,883
You can't trust him.

953
01:08:59,883 --> 01:09:02,478
He is reliably bad.

954
01:09:03,146 --> 01:09:05,446
- Do you feel betrayed?
- Yeah, I do.

955
01:09:05,446 --> 01:09:06,920
That's Running Man.

956
01:09:07,244 --> 01:09:09,583
You know after a few
times you get angry.

957
01:09:10,146 --> 01:09:12,456
Someone did that for three years.

958
01:09:12,456 --> 01:09:13,753
Me.

959
01:09:13,753 --> 01:09:15,254
Woo Bin is going to win anyway.

960
01:09:15,254 --> 01:09:17,845
No, there's the One Badge.

961
01:09:17,845 --> 01:09:22,013
Whether Jae Suk has it or Jong Kook
has it, their targets will be Woo Bin.

962
01:09:22,771 --> 01:09:26,724
- That's game then.
- Getting Woo Bin's name tag ends the game.

963
01:09:27,835 --> 01:09:30,059
- Let's go then.
- Where?

964
01:09:30,059 --> 01:09:31,656
To the hotel.

965
01:09:32,409 --> 01:09:34,736
Where's the restroom here?

966
01:09:36,317 --> 01:09:39,238
10 minutes?
I have to find Lee Kwang Soo first.

967
01:09:40,330 --> 01:09:45,823
For 10 minutes, this is my street.
Let's go.

968
01:10:02,951 --> 01:10:07,337
This is what you call waiting
for the opportune moment.

969
01:10:08,461 --> 01:10:10,981
What's that?
The One Badge?

970
01:10:18,264 --> 01:10:19,889
Sir yes sir!

971
01:10:20,898 --> 01:10:23,707
Let me take Jong Kook's tag off!

972
01:10:24,807 --> 01:10:27,442
- You have a lot of stars.
- Yes sir. I will give them to you sir.

973
01:10:27,442 --> 01:10:29,227
No, I don't need them.

974
01:10:29,607 --> 01:10:30,806
Please.

975
01:10:31,248 --> 01:10:34,140
I was immature when I was
young. I'm sorry sir!

976
01:10:34,140 --> 01:10:37,759
You were speaking some rather
mean words to me earlier.

977
01:10:37,759 --> 01:10:42,077
- I was...
- You made a fist at me.

978
01:10:42,077 --> 01:10:45,212
- I always carried a disease.
- Switch hats?

979
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:52,855
Finally I have a hat that suits me.

980
01:10:52,855 --> 01:10:55,025
- Where is Woo Bin?
- He went that way earlier.

981
01:10:55,025 --> 01:10:57,625
- What about Ji Hoon?
- I took him out sir.

982
01:10:57,625 --> 01:11:00,169
- And Ji Hyo?
- She's doing her mission somewhere.

983
01:11:00,169 --> 01:11:02,502
- I saw Jong Kook going in for a mission.
- Yes.

984
01:11:02,502 --> 01:11:04,783
- Will you take out Jong Kook for me then?
- Yes sir.

985
01:11:04,783 --> 01:11:07,753
- Good. You know about this badge?
- Yes sir. I was shocked sir.

986
01:11:07,753 --> 01:11:10,369
- How did you know?
- They made an announcement.

987
01:11:10,809 --> 01:11:12,695
Oh no.

988
01:11:12,695 --> 01:11:14,432
That's why everyone is hiding.

989
01:11:14,432 --> 01:11:19,592
Even if it weren't for the announcement, anyone
would have ran away from your presence.

990
01:11:19,592 --> 01:11:22,291
Turn around.

991
01:11:22,805 --> 01:11:24,738
Turn around.

992
01:11:24,738 --> 01:11:27,290
- Sheriff.
- Turn around.

993
01:11:27,290 --> 01:11:30,113
- Not that it's a problem.
- Turn around before I lose it.

994
01:11:30,394 --> 01:11:32,840
- I can turn around.
- Turn around if you don't want any trouble.

995
01:11:32,840 --> 01:11:34,416
- But...
- Turn around.

996
01:11:34,416 --> 01:11:37,109
They say people abuse power
when they have power.

997
01:11:37,109 --> 01:11:39,579
Okay, where did you get all this?

998
01:11:39,579 --> 01:11:42,306
I can take stars from him?

999
01:11:42,704 --> 01:11:47,329
If you take his name tag right now,
you get to have all his stars.

1000
01:11:47,500 --> 01:11:48,848
Really?

1001
01:11:48,848 --> 01:11:52,409
Director! What a cruel thing to say.
Please leave us to talk privately.

1002
01:11:52,409 --> 01:11:54,268
I don't want you to interrupt.

1003
01:11:54,268 --> 01:11:56,482
Look. Turn around.

1004
01:11:56,482 --> 01:11:58,151
Sir!

1005
01:11:58,466 --> 01:12:00,656
- No! No!
- Sir!

1006
01:12:00,656 --> 01:12:01,864
I have always wanted to call you sir.

1007
01:12:02,032 --> 01:12:06,067
- Then take out Jong Kook in front of me.
- Yes sir. I can do it sir.

1008
01:12:06,382 --> 01:12:09,360
- You're going to betray me again?
- No sir.

1009
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:11,824
It's just that taking you out
right now is too easy.

1010
01:12:11,825 --> 01:12:13,338
- It's not fun.
- Absolutely sir.

1011
01:12:13,338 --> 01:12:16,006
- It's too obvious. I hate obvious.
- Absolutely sir.

1012
01:12:16,375 --> 01:12:18,175
- Take out Jong Kook right now.
- Yes sir.

1013
01:12:18,175 --> 01:12:20,630
You don't need any words.
Just go and take him out.

1014
01:12:20,630 --> 01:12:23,046
- Okay go.
- Thank you sir.

1015
01:12:35,283 --> 01:12:37,253
- He's splitting wood.
- Good.

1016
01:12:37,777 --> 01:12:39,817
I will go get him.

1017
01:12:39,817 --> 01:12:42,794
Wait for him to finish his mission.

1018
01:12:43,162 --> 01:12:45,441
Let's go!

1019
01:12:46,815 --> 01:12:48,447
- Thank you!
- Here's your stuff.

1020
01:12:48,447 --> 01:12:51,034
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you. Good job.

1021
01:12:56,817 --> 01:12:58,927
It's not over yet!

1022
01:12:59,311 --> 01:13:02,266
Good job! Good work.

1023
01:13:02,731 --> 01:13:05,389
- Take it off.
- I will take it off sir.

1024
01:13:05,389 --> 01:13:07,834
Please! Let me take it.

1025
01:13:07,834 --> 01:13:10,476
Jong Kook!
Are you holding him for me?

1026
01:13:11,100 --> 01:13:13,162
Sir! Sir!

1027
01:13:13,479 --> 01:13:15,294
You cannot forget!

1028
01:13:16,253 --> 01:13:17,744
I will take his and give it right
back to you.

1029
01:13:17,744 --> 01:13:19,903
He's taken so many from me.

1030
01:13:22,362 --> 01:13:24,815
- No!
- Okay, you can go.

1031
01:13:25,953 --> 01:13:29,273
- Are you ready to do your best for me?
- Of course.

1032
01:13:29,273 --> 01:13:32,057
- Will you do your best for me?
- Of course.

1033
01:13:32,057 --> 01:13:34,857
- Okay! I will trust you then.
- Okay!

1034
01:13:35,410 --> 01:13:37,726
- Wait.
- I will take them off for you.

1035
01:13:38,150 --> 01:13:40,181
Get your hands off of me!

1036
01:13:40,664 --> 01:13:42,702
They are my stars!

1037
01:13:42,995 --> 01:13:45,735
I can't believe a two-star
insults me like this.

1038
01:13:46,076 --> 01:13:48,488
Good work sir.

1039
01:13:48,488 --> 01:13:50,794
Will you help me too?
Right here.

1040
01:13:58,232 --> 01:14:00,361
- What are you doing?
- I'm helping you.

1041
01:14:00,361 --> 01:14:02,276
What are you doing? You can go.

1042
01:14:03,220 --> 01:14:07,089
- Go now!
- I should have finished you back then!

1043
01:14:07,664 --> 01:14:10,272
I should have finished you!

1044
01:14:11,458 --> 01:14:14,706
That's what happens to the
hounds after hunting is over.

1045
01:14:16,021 --> 01:14:19,147
Why can't you talk softly like
that normally?

1046
01:14:19,488 --> 01:14:21,136
It's so nice.

1047
01:14:21,136 --> 01:14:24,200
Look at you. You know
how to warm up to people.

1048
01:14:25,900 --> 01:14:28,504
- I like you.
- Of course sir.

1049
01:14:30,425 --> 01:14:32,097
I think I like you.

1050
01:14:32,097 --> 01:14:34,896
- Shall I end this now?
- You just have so many.

1051
01:14:37,225 --> 01:14:39,384
They look really good on you sir.

1052
01:14:40,432 --> 01:14:43,857
Done! One, two, three, four...

1053
01:14:44,381 --> 01:14:46,867
- No need. Let's go.
- Yes sir.

1054
01:14:46,867 --> 01:14:50,266
- I think Woo Bin is determined.
- Yes sir.

1055
01:14:50,266 --> 01:14:53,217
- I think it's time to end it now.
- Yes sir.

1056
01:14:54,290 --> 01:14:58,177
Thank you for giving me the chance to
exact my vengeance.

1057
01:14:58,766 --> 01:15:02,929
I will protect you.
You have nothing to worry about.

1058
01:15:03,485 --> 01:15:08,945
- Even after your expiration is due...
- I will get you a new hat when I win.

1059
01:15:09,405 --> 01:15:12,260
- You look like a mess.
- Yes sir.

1060
01:15:12,260 --> 01:15:16,355
No matter how hard it is,
you should always dress up.

1061
01:15:16,355 --> 01:15:19,107
- Like me.
- Thank you sir.

1062
01:15:21,856 --> 01:15:25,088
- It's running out.
- Really? Let's go.

1063
01:15:25,088 --> 01:15:26,479
We need to get Woo Bin.

1064
01:15:26,479 --> 01:15:29,050
We could lose it all to Woo Bin.

1065
01:15:29,914 --> 01:15:32,905
You must be careful. Let's go.

1066
01:15:34,521 --> 01:15:37,493
- Where is he?
- Where is Woo Bin?

1067
01:15:37,949 --> 01:15:40,391
The target is me.

1068
01:15:41,370 --> 01:15:43,511
Is Woo Bin over there?
I don't think so.

1069
01:15:56,211 --> 01:15:59,056
The wind is blowing right before
the final battle.

1070
01:15:59,056 --> 01:16:01,397
- It's almost over.
- I know, please give me some time.

1071
01:16:02,883 --> 01:16:05,630
My friends told me to win this.

1072
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:12,058
- Where is he?
- Where is he?

1073
01:16:12,107 --> 01:16:14,044
How many badges does Woo Bin have?

1074
01:16:14,044 --> 01:16:19,901
He has a lot. Even if you
were to take mine... 20...

1075
01:16:21,484 --> 01:16:23,687
I'm glad I have a lot of badges at least.

1076
01:16:23,687 --> 01:16:25,910
- Or you would have taken mine.
- I would not.

1077
01:16:26,313 --> 01:16:29,208
- You would have grabbed me by my wrist.
- No.

1078
01:16:30,466 --> 01:16:32,674
I should have found Woo Bin.

1079
01:16:33,732 --> 01:16:35,662
Let's go hide.

1080
01:16:35,662 --> 01:16:39,401
And see how many Woo Bin has.
If he has more than you...

1081
01:16:40,085 --> 01:16:42,895
Then take mine and win.

1082
01:16:42,895 --> 01:16:44,925
You see my devotion? Huh?

1083
01:16:45,614 --> 01:16:50,111
- You are devoted.
- I will devote myself for someone else's victory.

1084
01:16:50,111 --> 01:16:53,016
I'm the type to devote myself.
It's called a sacrifice.

1085
01:16:53,339 --> 01:16:55,201
Sacrifice.

1086
01:16:55,201 --> 01:16:57,989
- Beautiful.
- Yeah, I sacrifice.

1087
01:16:59,183 --> 01:17:02,285
- You're like a brother.
- I am.

1088
01:17:04,197 --> 01:17:07,571
Give them to me right now.

1089
01:17:08,447 --> 01:17:11,939
Give them to me right now.
I think I need them.

1090
01:17:12,411 --> 01:17:15,975
You must be kidding.
You are kidding.

1091
01:17:16,693 --> 01:17:19,455
He took Jong Kook's.

1092
01:17:20,017 --> 01:17:23,280
You could go to Woo Bin.
Give them to me right now. I'm sorry.

1093
01:17:23,280 --> 01:17:25,944
I was talking about sacrifice.

1094
01:17:25,944 --> 01:17:27,955
Yeah, you can sacrifice right now.

1095
01:17:27,955 --> 01:17:29,900
It's for the greater good.

1096
01:17:30,777 --> 01:17:32,787
Don't touch me.
I will give them to you.

1097
01:17:32,787 --> 01:17:35,321
Your attitude is changing.

1098
01:17:35,862 --> 01:17:38,118
I was being nice to you.

1099
01:17:38,614 --> 01:17:40,467
Is this your last day on Running Man?

1100
01:17:40,479 --> 01:17:43,800
- Your attitude is back again?
- Is this your last day on Running Man?

1101
01:17:44,551 --> 01:17:47,264
- You're not going to put them on for him?
- No, why would I?

1102
01:17:47,637 --> 01:17:49,600
You were putting them on me earlier.

1103
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:52,625
You want me to put them on
so that they will never come off?

1104
01:17:52,625 --> 01:17:55,206
- What are you saying?
- Put them on for good?

1105
01:17:55,507 --> 01:17:57,213
You want badges on for life?

1106
01:17:57,721 --> 01:17:59,779
Gosh.

1107
01:18:16,585 --> 01:18:18,497
Two left?

1108
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:22,352
Ji Hyo and Jae Suk.

1109
01:18:23,019 --> 01:18:25,571
The One Badge is over.

1110
01:18:25,865 --> 01:18:27,729
Okay.

1111
01:18:28,481 --> 01:18:31,371
- Hello!
- Hello! See you again.

1112
01:18:31,371 --> 01:18:33,693
Hi!

1113
01:18:34,261 --> 01:18:36,147
Wow, look at all these
stars you have.

1114
01:18:37,054 --> 01:18:38,681
Wait, what do the stars represent?

1115
01:18:38,989 --> 01:18:40,862
That's really long...

1116
01:18:41,722 --> 01:18:44,707
- You want them?
- Yes!

1117
01:18:46,679 --> 01:18:48,492
Can I have one please?

1118
01:18:50,940 --> 01:18:53,834
Sorry, but only one!

1119
01:18:58,293 --> 01:19:00,941
Sorry! You keep!

1120
01:19:00,941 --> 01:19:02,642
Thank you so much.

1121
01:19:02,642 --> 01:19:04,685
Sorry! Bye bye.

1122
01:19:04,685 --> 01:19:06,379
Bye!

1123
01:19:13,353 --> 01:19:15,017
Karkar!

1124
01:19:15,544 --> 01:19:17,649
I wish I could give them all.

1125
01:19:19,043 --> 01:19:20,715
But I still have the power for that right?

1126
01:19:20,715 --> 01:19:23,322
- No! You have 19 now.
- Why?

1127
01:19:23,322 --> 01:19:25,374
That's a gift!

1128
01:19:25,652 --> 01:19:27,587
- That's a gift.
- You have 19.

1129
01:19:27,862 --> 01:19:29,684
I know that you're nice.

1130
01:19:30,200 --> 01:19:32,818
I just gave one. Imagine how
much she wanted this.

1131
01:19:33,660 --> 01:19:35,668
19 now.

1132
01:19:37,074 --> 01:19:39,859
Have you seen Jae Suk?

1133
01:19:44,064 --> 01:19:45,333
Wait.

1134
01:19:48,407 --> 01:19:52,355
How many do you have?

1135
01:19:52,355 --> 01:19:55,765
How many do you have?

1136
01:20:01,919 --> 01:20:03,359
How many?

1137
01:20:03,359 --> 01:20:05,439
How many do you have?

1138
01:20:06,047 --> 01:20:07,504
21.

1139
01:20:07,504 --> 01:20:09,181
Oh.

1140
01:20:09,181 --> 01:20:10,915
- We have the same.
- Really?

1141
01:20:10,915 --> 01:20:12,675
- Yeah.
- Oh.

1142
01:20:13,414 --> 01:20:15,816
- I see.
- Do you really have 21?

1143
01:20:16,344 --> 01:20:18,368
You can tell.

1144
01:20:18,762 --> 01:20:20,895
I have this many too.

1145
01:20:21,231 --> 01:20:24,669
You know if you miscount,
it gets you back right?

1146
01:20:25,176 --> 01:20:27,352
- I think it's about the same.
- What?

1147
01:20:27,352 --> 01:20:29,525
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1148
01:20:29,803 --> 01:20:34,055
- You can take it off to find out.
- Should I?

1149
01:20:34,055 --> 01:20:36,533
- It could get out back.
- I know.

1150
01:20:36,533 --> 01:20:38,868
You look like you're convicted.

1151
01:20:39,096 --> 01:20:41,127
What do you want to do?
Be a man?

1152
01:20:41,682 --> 01:20:43,789
- You want to do it?
- Sure.

1153
01:20:43,789 --> 01:20:45,714
But have you seen Ji Hyo or not?

1154
01:20:45,714 --> 01:20:47,565
- I haven't seen her.
- Really?

1155
01:20:48,769 --> 01:20:50,172
Oh.

1156
01:20:50,172 --> 01:20:51,983
- When did you collect so many?
- Huh?

1157
01:20:51,983 --> 01:20:53,528
When did you collect so many?

1158
01:20:53,528 --> 01:20:55,192
It's a long story.

1159
01:20:55,192 --> 01:20:58,366
I've been working hard.

1160
01:20:58,366 --> 01:21:01,349
I think we should take out Ji Hyo first.

1161
01:21:01,349 --> 01:21:06,153
<i>Shadow in operation.</i>

1162
01:21:06,617 --> 01:21:10,411
<i>There are two One Badges.</i>

1163
01:21:10,411 --> 01:21:13,260
<i>One may take off the name tags.
The other one cannot.</i>

1164
01:21:13,568 --> 01:21:15,492
But there is only Ji Hyo left.

1165
01:21:16,232 --> 01:21:18,150
What?

1166
01:21:19,523 --> 01:21:21,766
What's that mean?

1167
01:21:52,375 --> 01:21:54,879
What's going on?

1168
01:21:56,133 --> 01:21:58,300
What's going on?

1169
01:21:59,462 --> 01:22:02,030
I'm sorry!

1170
01:22:03,832 --> 01:22:06,629
- Woo Bin!
- What's going on?

1171
01:22:15,267 --> 01:22:17,634
Life is futile.

1172
01:22:19,662 --> 01:22:23,958
I should have just given
these to all of those little girls.

1173
01:22:28,504 --> 01:22:30,392
It's so good!

1174
01:22:30,949 --> 01:22:33,174
Shadow is the best!

1175
01:22:37,989 --> 01:22:39,575
<i>[30 minutes ago]</i>

1176
01:22:46,548 --> 01:22:48,622
Thank you!

1177
01:22:51,232 --> 01:22:52,911
Thank you!

1178
01:22:56,778 --> 01:22:59,562
Shadow?
What does this mean?

1179
01:23:03,205 --> 01:23:05,876
The One Badge is running out.
Look for him!

1180
01:23:07,309 --> 01:23:10,669
- Where is he?
- How many badges does Woo Bin have?

1181
01:23:14,911 --> 01:23:16,813
It's here.

1182
01:23:29,353 --> 01:23:31,545
Why is there one more?

1183
01:23:32,405 --> 01:23:34,660
Shadow?

1184
01:23:34,942 --> 01:23:36,259
- It says 'Shadow' on it right?
- Yes.

1185
01:23:36,586 --> 01:23:39,442
This one is different from the
One Badge from earlier.

1186
01:23:40,184 --> 01:23:46,198
You may revive someone taken out
and be invincible for five minutes.

1187
01:23:49,761 --> 01:23:51,401
- Ji Hyo!
- It's Ji Hyo.

1188
01:23:51,401 --> 01:23:53,271
I have two One Badges.

1189
01:23:53,271 --> 01:23:55,327
You can revive us?

1190
01:23:55,327 --> 01:23:57,511
- I can revive one.
- Just one?

1191
01:23:57,511 --> 01:24:02,105
That person and I can join together
have have absolute power for five minutes.

1192
01:24:03,553 --> 01:24:06,715
But five minutes after that person
disappears too.

1193
01:24:06,715 --> 01:24:08,410
He will disappear.

1194
01:24:08,410 --> 01:24:10,184
- Ji Hoon! Go.
- Go Ji Hoon.

1195
01:24:10,390 --> 01:24:11,959
If you take everyone out
within the time, you win.

1196
01:24:11,959 --> 01:24:16,818
And I promise to split the
winnings seven to three.

1197
01:24:16,818 --> 01:24:18,839
Go Ji Hoon.

1198
01:24:18,839 --> 01:24:21,557
Let Ji Hoon win.

1199
01:24:29,853 --> 01:24:31,269
What's going on?

1200
01:24:32,317 --> 01:24:35,092
I'm sorry! Let's go!

1201
01:24:36,418 --> 01:24:38,787
This is the best.

1202
01:24:38,787 --> 01:24:40,993
This is the best.

1203
01:24:43,515 --> 01:24:45,747
Woo Bin!

1204
01:24:47,614 --> 01:24:49,598
I'm sorry. Let's end it here.

1205
01:24:55,689 --> 01:24:58,697
We have the One Badge.

1206
01:25:12,248 --> 01:25:15,287
Woo Bin!

1207
01:25:18,449 --> 01:25:21,995
Where are you going?

1208
01:25:25,282 --> 01:25:27,863
Woo Bin! It's over.

1209
01:25:28,309 --> 01:25:29,861
It's over Woo Bin.

1210
01:25:30,517 --> 01:25:32,629
- It's not over.
- Let's just go.

1211
01:25:32,897 --> 01:25:35,470
Go where?

1212
01:25:37,340 --> 01:25:44,424
Five, four, three, two, one.

1213
01:25:45,205 --> 01:25:49,800
It's over.
We can't do anything about it.

1214
01:25:49,800 --> 01:25:52,217
Geez.

1215
01:26:06,935 --> 01:26:11,971
Kim Woo Bin! It seems that you got
yourself 23 stars while I was getting mine.

1216
01:26:11,971 --> 01:26:13,284
Of course.

1217
01:26:13,284 --> 01:26:15,308
- 23 right?
- 23.

1218
01:26:17,591 --> 01:26:19,514
- What should we do?
- What else?

1219
01:26:19,514 --> 01:26:21,913
We have no place left to go.

1220
01:26:22,835 --> 01:26:24,555
It was a fun time.

1221
01:26:24,555 --> 01:26:26,238
- It was fun.
- In Australia.

1222
01:26:26,681 --> 01:26:30,954
In Australia... with you.
Thank you.

1223
01:26:30,954 --> 01:26:36,489
I get to face Kim Woo Bin,
the hot shot nowadays.

1224
01:26:36,489 --> 01:26:38,661
- It's an honor.
- Stop it.

1225
01:26:41,914 --> 01:26:43,956
I will die honorably.

1226
01:27:02,707 --> 01:27:04,259
Wait!

1227
01:27:13,748 --> 01:27:15,772
So this is how you play?

1228
01:27:15,772 --> 01:27:17,741
You hold the vest!

1229
01:27:36,159 --> 01:27:38,956
Good job. You worked hard.

1230
01:27:39,434 --> 01:27:43,566
Good job.
You won fair and square.

1231
01:27:47,928 --> 01:27:51,767
It looks like Ji Hyo has won.

1232
01:27:52,246 --> 01:27:54,860
Woo Bin has won.

1233
01:27:55,242 --> 01:27:57,628
Woo Bin has won?

1234
01:27:58,065 --> 01:27:59,862
Good job.

1235
01:28:03,614 --> 01:28:07,357
Finally after three visits,
you get to win.

1236
01:28:07,357 --> 01:28:10,800
He was talking about never coming back.

1237
01:28:11,352 --> 01:28:12,633
Good job.

1238
01:28:12,633 --> 01:28:15,653
Woo Bin won on his third visit.

1239
01:28:16,398 --> 01:28:18,544
- Here is the prize.
- What's the prize?

1240
01:28:20,874 --> 01:28:23,991
Woo Bin! Take us out tonight.

1241
01:28:24,604 --> 01:28:27,171
Woo Bin won!

1242
01:28:27,180 --> 01:28:30,196
- Congratulate him!
- It's real money!

1243
01:28:30,196 --> 01:28:33,168
I think I'm smiling for the first time
in three days.

1244
01:28:34,952 --> 01:28:37,258
- It's all thanks to your help.
- Will you visit us again?

1245
01:28:37,258 --> 01:28:39,035
I will come back.

1246
01:28:39,035 --> 01:28:42,208
If I didn't win today, I was
really going to think about it.

1247
01:28:42,996 --> 01:28:47,158
Ji Hoon and Woo Bin really worked
hard this time.

1248
01:28:47,464 --> 01:28:50,895
Let's applaud them.

1249
01:28:52,282 --> 01:28:56,381
I would like thank those
who have helped us.

1250
01:28:56,737 --> 01:28:59,524
We will see you in Korea.
Thank you!

1251
01:28:59,524 --> 01:29:00,612

- We may go far away today.
- Really?

Let's go. Let's go, let's go!

1255
01:29:09,282 --> 01:29:10,774
Where's the bus?

1256
01:29:10,774 --> 01:29:12,243
I didn't get off here.

1257
01:29:13,777 --> 01:29:15,433
No way. No!

1258
01:29:15,942 --> 01:29:18,103

Where are we going?

Wait!
