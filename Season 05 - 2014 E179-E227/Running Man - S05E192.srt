[This is... the taping of Running Man,
right?]

77
00:05:00,203 --> 00:05:02,407
Dong Jun, a singer from a
popular boy band.

[A rising new star, Dong Jun.]

79
00:05:07,026 --> 00:05:10,195

- Why don't you two sit closer together?
- I feel too shy to do that.

89
00:05:39,403 --> 00:05:41,366
I can't believe you're partnered up
with Lee Sang Hwa.

90
00:05:41,367 --> 00:05:44,605
I think Gary's really compatible with women
who have an affinity for gold.

91
00:05:44,606 --> 00:05:47,842
[Two time gold medalist, Sang Hwa,
and gold prize sweeper, Ji Hyo's man.]

[Arriving as soon as
her drama shoot wrapped up.]

95
00:05:56,539 --> 00:05:58,050
He's your partner.

96
00:05:58,051 --> 00:06:00,067
Oh my goodness, really?

97
00:06:00,418 --> 00:06:03,648
[Seeing her handsome partner
snaps her out of her sleep.]

98
00:06:04,972 --> 00:06:07,043

99
00:06:07,044 --> 00:06:09,805

- He chased me down to kill me in the drama.
- Really?

102
00:06:15,788 --> 00:06:18,934
- And here you two are partnered up together.
- I'll treat her better today.

103
00:06:19,604 --> 00:06:22,343
Everyone have a seat with your partner,
and Yoo Jae Suk can remain standing.

104
00:06:23,267 --> 00:06:25,105
Who's my partner?

105
00:06:25,106 --> 00:06:29,163
Yoo Jae Suk's partner will be here later
due to a conflicting work schedule.

106
00:06:29,164 --> 00:06:32,180
- It must be a busy person.
- Either busy, or a late sleeper.

107
00:06:32,181 --> 00:06:33,210
[Just who could it be?]

108
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:38,729
[Most impressive partner lineup

None of you currently knows where you'll
end up with your partners.

114
00:06:55,485 --> 00:06:57,565
I don't even have a partner right now.

115
00:06:57,566 --> 00:06:59,849
You just stay quiet
since you don't even have a partner.

116
00:07:00,859 --> 00:07:04,316
You'll have to figure out your own way
to your final destination.

117
00:07:05,234 --> 00:07:11,140
You're not allowed to drive yourself at all,
and use only public transit today.

118
00:07:11,141 --> 00:07:16,994
- As for the type of public transit...
- What are you going to say now?

119
00:07:16,995 --> 00:07:21,298
You'll roll this die to figure out which mode
of transportation you'll be using.

120
00:07:23,127 --> 00:07:26,067
Since this is Running Man, there will be
missions to complete along the way.

121
00:07:26,068 --> 00:07:29,145
[Complete the missions along the way...]

122
00:07:29,146 --> 00:07:34,418
[And a special advantage will be given to
the team who arrives first.]

123
00:07:34,419 --> 00:07:36,500
We'll just ice skate our way there.

124
00:07:36,933 --> 00:07:39,655
- Why? Aren't you confident about it?
- Let's go for the train!

125
00:07:41,013 --> 00:07:42,725
Airplane!

126

[Suk Jin and Jung Nan- Airplane.]

131
00:08:05,947 --> 00:08:07,521
This is great!

132
00:08:08,004 --> 00:08:12,080
[In this case, then everyone else
naturally gets the train.]

133
00:08:17,668 --> 00:08:20,044
[Travel fees are dispersed to
each of the teams.]

134
00:08:20,045 --> 00:08:23,927
The two airplane teams may step forward
to accept their mission cards.

135
00:08:23,928 --> 00:08:28,042
- You can see how you may travel.
- I should be with Min Jong.

136
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:32,486
<i>[Take the flight out of Gimpo Airport,
and go to Gwangjoo Airport. Departs at 1:10.]</i>

00:08:41,339 --> 00:08:46,287
<i>[Take KTX 605 from Yongsan Station to
Iksan Station. Departs at 10:20 AM.]</i>

141
00:08:46,464 --> 00:08:50,021
[Jae Suk is given his partner's
phone number.]

142
00:08:50,022 --> 00:08:51,975
If you call your partner,
then your partner should answer the phone.

143
00:08:51,976 --> 00:08:55,267
- Try calling the number.
- Will my partner answer an unknown number?

144
00:09:02,165 --> 00:09:04,292
- Hello?
- Hello?

145
00:09:04,913 --> 00:09:06,423
<i>Hello.</i>

146
00:09:07,052 --> 00:09:10,326
['Hello'?
Could it be a foreigner?]

147
00:09:10,327 --> 00:09:12,150
Who's this?

148
00:09:13,501 --> 00:09:14,784
Me?

149
00:09:14,785 --> 00:09:18,236
I can tell by his English
that he's not a very fluent speaker.

150
00:09:18,237 --> 00:09:20,908
Seeing how he just said, 'me',
I can tell that he's not very fluent.

151
00:09:21,402 --> 00:09:24,705
We have to be on the 10:20 train.

152
00:09:25,886 --> 00:09:28,399
<i>Then where do I need to go?</i>

153
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:31,903
Yongsan Station.
Train at the Yongsan Station.

154
00:09:32,358 --> 00:09:34,509
Maybe.

155
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:37,248
- What's the mission?
- Who could this be?

156
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:39,360
Seeing how you're mixing up
some English words in there

157
00:09:39,361 --> 00:09:42,577
I can be totally wrong about this,
but I think you may be a bit of a goofball?

158
00:09:43,968 --> 00:09:47,153
<i>I'll just see you later.
Do I need to stay on the phone with you?</i>

159
00:09:48,071 --> 00:09:49,573
Wait!

160
00:09:50,216 --> 00:09:52,361
I just realized by your laughter!

161
00:09:52,362 --> 00:09:56,087
Okay, I got it!
Are you serious right now?

162
00:09:56,525 --> 00:09:59,644
What are you doing instead of
coming down here right now?

163
00:09:59,645 --> 00:10:05,048
- I just finished things up here.
- Really? Then come to Yongsan Station.

164
00:10:05,493 --> 00:10:07,031
- Okay.
- Okay.

165
00:10:07,032 --> 00:10:10,491
I'm right, aren't I?
This guy is a bit of a goofball.

166
00:10:11,043 --> 00:10:14,170
I know that I'm right.
I recognize that voice.

167
00:10:14,171 --> 00:10:16,887
[You will soon find out who
his partner is.]

168
00:10:16,888 --> 00:10:21,864
[SBS- 8:30 AM.
Right before getting on their way.]

169
00:10:21,865 --> 00:10:23,801
Okay, let's go.

170
00:10:24,237 --> 00:10:27,316
[They can only use the money they
were given for their mission.]

171
00:10:27,317 --> 00:10:29,546
[The Plane Team decides to share a taxi.]

172
00:10:30,605 --> 00:10:34,969
[Kkuk will take over the
camera himself.]

173
00:10:36,786 --> 00:10:39,342
- We'll see you later.
- Okay, see you later.

174
00:10:39,343 --> 00:10:41,136
[Team Bus also decides to share a taxi.]

175
00:10:41,137 --> 00:10:44,414
- We're in this together.
- We are as one.

176
00:10:44,415 --> 00:10:46,920
- How many are we?
- We are one!

177
00:10:46,921 --> 00:10:48,416
Yes, we are one.

178
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:50,998
Please take us to the bus terminal.

179
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:56,220
You know that we're on
different teams, right?

180
00:10:56,221 --> 00:10:58,529
- They're not with us.
- Yes, I know that.

181
00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:02,692
- So this is how you betray people?
- No, this isn't a betrayal.

182
00:11:04,228 --> 00:11:06,966
- I've seen all your competitions.
- Seriously?

183
00:11:08,293 --> 00:11:13,407
I saw you starting in the outer course,
and come out ahead of all the others.

184
00:11:13,408 --> 00:11:15,120
So you did see it.

185
00:11:15,121 --> 00:11:18,276
It was so exciting and satisfying
to see that.

186
00:11:18,277 --> 00:11:21,208
The emotions that I saw on your face
when you realized your final time

187
00:11:21,209 --> 00:11:25,961
after crossing the finish line?

188
00:11:25,962 --> 00:11:31,862
- I thought I was going to cry too.
- I was so unbelievably shaken up.

189
00:11:31,863 --> 00:11:37,746
That was the moment when everyone realized
that I was going to take home another medal.

190
00:11:37,747 --> 00:11:44,522
Everyone's comments about me taking home
another gold was actually pretty burdensome.

191
00:11:44,557 --> 00:11:50,413
And the other members of the team lost their
chances at taking home a medal the day before.

192
00:11:50,414 --> 00:11:57,420
So that added even more pressure on me,
and that was so difficult.

193
00:11:57,455 --> 00:11:59,042
I couldn't even fall asleep.

194
00:11:59,043 --> 00:12:02,498
I usually don't get any sleep
the night before the competition.

195
00:12:02,499 --> 00:12:04,102
Especially during the Olympic games.

196
00:12:04,103 --> 00:12:11,894
Four years of blood, sweat, and tears
hang on those few short minutes, right?

197
00:12:13,852 --> 00:12:17,930
- It was really hard.
- We're encountering awful traffic today.

198
00:12:18,537 --> 00:12:21,368
What are we going to do?
The train leaves at 10:20.

199
00:12:21,369 --> 00:12:25,710
If we don't get there on time,
let's just get on any train cars

200
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,095
and we'll just have to stand
the whole way to our destination.

201
00:12:32,576 --> 00:12:36,160
[Yongsan Station- 9:10 AM.]

202
00:12:36,161 --> 00:12:38,183
<i>- Yes?
- Where are you?</i>

203
00:12:39,172 --> 00:12:42,776
- I'm around the station already.
- Where?

204
00:12:43,497 --> 00:12:46,315
<i>I'm right in front of the
snack stand.</i>

205
00:12:46,316 --> 00:12:50,981
What are you doing over there when we're
going to have snacks aboard the train?

206
00:12:50,982 --> 00:12:53,846
- We're going to be eating?
- The train departs at 10:20.

207
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:57,251
Why don't we meet at the platform?

208
00:12:59,501 --> 00:13:02,197
We have a mission to do here.

209
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:05,725
We have a mission
that we're going to have to do.

210
00:13:06,521 --> 00:13:08,613
Number 605.

211
00:13:08,701 --> 00:13:12,456
[They're about to go camping together...]

212
00:13:12,671 --> 00:13:16,202
[But they're about to meet for the first time
out in front of the train?]

213
00:13:21,891 --> 00:13:25,907
[Seeing the lack of surprise on his face,
is it who he thought it was going to be?]

214
00:13:25,908 --> 00:13:27,311
Seriously.

215
00:13:27,939 --> 00:13:31,590
- Why aren't you in team uniform yet?
- We have a team uniform?

216
00:13:31,591 --> 00:13:34,139
[Jae Suk's camping partner is...]

217
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:42,456
[Popular actor, Ryu Seung Soo.]

218
00:13:42,457 --> 00:13:44,611
- Why did you already have a burger?
- Huh?

219
00:13:45,034 --> 00:13:48,831
- We're going to get fed?
- We'll buy something onboard.

220
00:13:50,236 --> 00:13:52,031
Where are we going?

221
00:13:52,032 --> 00:13:54,223
- You don't know anything at all?
- I have no clue what's going on.

222
00:13:54,224 --> 00:13:57,426
None of us knows anything either.
All I know is that we get on the train.

223
00:13:58,312 --> 00:14:03,726
We're just going to keep following
you and Jae Suk.

224
00:14:03,727 --> 00:14:05,484
Okay, use us if you can.

225
00:14:05,485 --> 00:14:07,522
Come on, hurry up!

226
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:13,674
- It's Ryu Seung Soo!
- Oh my goodness!

227
00:14:13,675 --> 00:14:15,151
- Hi, Teach!
- What do you mean, 'Teach'?

228
00:14:15,152 --> 00:14:18,145
- He was my acting teacher.
- That's right! He used to teach there.

229
00:14:18,146 --> 00:14:20,750
- She was your student?
- Yes.

230
00:14:20,751 --> 00:14:24,566
[Ji Hyo's former acting teacher.]

231
00:14:24,567 --> 00:14:27,861
I thought you said your partner
was going to be Jeon Ji Hyun!

232
00:14:27,862 --> 00:14:30,443
I thought it was going to be her,
but it's Ryu Seung Soo instead.

233
00:14:30,444 --> 00:14:33,563
- What do you have in your hand?
- My partner wanted some snacks.

234
00:14:33,564 --> 00:14:36,447
[A bag of snacks for his
gold medal winning partner.]

235
00:14:36,448 --> 00:14:38,534
- You can't spend money now.
- Money is meant to be spent.

236
00:14:38,535 --> 00:14:41,213
You're going to starve later.
You have to be careful.

237
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:43,277
[Gary is being generous with his money
for his partner.]

238
00:14:43,278 --> 00:14:47,316
- Let's go camping!
- You have to think further ahead.

239
00:14:48,347 --> 00:14:51,137
Don't forget the mission we'll have to do
along the way too.

240
00:14:53,704 --> 00:14:57,165
[Team Airplane is headed to Gimpo Airport.]

241
00:14:57,967 --> 00:15:03,357
You didn't have to prepare all this for us.
You could've just kept it simple.

242
00:15:04,023 --> 00:15:05,983
[Trash cans on wheels?]

243
00:15:05,984 --> 00:15:09,830
Your plane departure time is
at 10:10, correct?

244
00:15:09,831 --> 00:15:14,862
Compared to all the other teams,
you have more missions you'll have to do.

245
00:15:15,276 --> 00:15:18,064
- And they'll be a bit more difficult as well.
- Really?

246
00:15:18,065 --> 00:15:21,163
- Then we won't get much of a lead.
- No kidding.

247
00:15:21,164 --> 00:15:27,736
Only one team, the winning team, will get
tickets for the 10:10 AM departing flight.

248
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:31,937
And the loser team will take the later flight,
which leaves at 1 PM.

249
00:15:31,938 --> 00:15:34,638
[The loser team will take the next flight,
which leaves three hours after the first one.]

250
00:15:35,791 --> 00:15:40,452
- Can we go to another airport?
- Can we do that?

251
00:15:40,453 --> 00:15:42,420
Stop with all the talking,
and just give us our mission.

252
00:15:42,421 --> 00:15:45,224
- Just give us the mission.
- Can we even get it done?

253
00:15:45,225 --> 00:15:47,828
- Trash can curling?
- Ah, this game?

254
00:15:47,829 --> 00:15:53,535
<i>Everyone gets in the trash can, and the team
with most members in the 'Board' zone wins.</i>

255
00:15:53,536 --> 00:15:56,162
- Okay, we get it.
- We've done this before.

256
00:15:56,163 --> 00:16:00,102
[Shove the trash cans with players in it
into the 'Board' zone to win the game.]

257
00:16:00,103 --> 00:16:02,617
- You have to get in the zone.
- It's just like curling.

258
00:16:02,618 --> 00:16:06,274
- We have to do it quickly.
- Let's move it!

259
00:16:06,275 --> 00:16:07,872
[Two teams are in a rush
to complete the mission.]

260

[Jung Nan is first to go.]

261
00:16:11,524 --> 00:16:14,550
Stronger than you think you'd need to.
There you go!

262
00:16:21,766 --> 00:16:25,214
[Big-nose Brother's interference plan.]

263
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:31,963

'Tiger Curling' is still pretty spot on.]

264

[Big-nose gets on his way to get the Tiger.]

265
00:16:40,574 --> 00:16:43,243
[Big-nose misses the board zone.]

266
00:16:46,322 --> 00:16:49,535
[Maybe there's still hope for the Tiger Team?]

267
00:16:52,039 --> 00:16:54,499
[So close...]

268
00:16:55,819 --> 00:16:59,562
[Both teams fail their first attempt.]

269
00:17:00,335 --> 00:17:03,119
- This isn't easy.
- There's no time. Let's go back and redo it.

270
00:17:06,336 --> 00:17:09,484
[At the same time,
over at the bus terminal.]

271
00:17:09,485 --> 00:17:11,127
Thank you for the delicious meal.

272
00:17:13,377 --> 00:17:19,064
[The two Bus Teams are enjoying
a delicious meal together while waiting.]

273
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,592
Even though it may feel like we just spent
a lot of money on our food

274
00:17:25,593 --> 00:17:28,084
but that may not be the case either.
We may not even need to eat later.

275
00:17:28,085 --> 00:17:30,470
[Everyone to pay for
their own individual meal.]

276
00:17:30,471 --> 00:17:33,088
- You have the least amount of money, right?
- We have the least amount.

277
00:17:33,089 --> 00:17:35,622
We may not have a lot of money,
but we're rich in other things.

278
00:17:35,623 --> 00:17:38,745
- Consideration... love.
- Love?

279
00:17:38,746 --> 00:17:40,751
Trust.

280
00:17:40,752 --> 00:17:44,406
- Generosity.
- And a bag full of ease.

281
00:17:44,407 --> 00:17:47,474
[The country boy is full of relaxed humor.]

282

[But why are these two acting
so suspicious?]

283
00:17:52,475 --> 00:17:54,950
Here, have some more fishcake.

284

[Why is Ha Ha all of a sudden being
so generous to the other team member?]

285
00:17:59,879 --> 00:18:01,857
Here, have some more noodles.

286
00:18:03,517 --> 00:18:06,345

Let's play a game and
the loser pays for the meal.

291
00:18:25,469 --> 00:18:28,326
- You guys are really pissing me off.
- Why are you getting pissed off?

292
00:18:28,327 --> 00:18:32,142
- What do you want to play?
- Something we can play now while sitting.

293
00:18:32,143 --> 00:18:33,599
Something simple.

294
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,353
How about a word game
since it's quick and easy?

295
00:18:38,604 --> 00:18:41,764
How about we make it a bit more unique?
I think that would be a lot of fun.

296
00:18:41,765 --> 00:18:47,189
- How about we get some ladies to help out?
- Yeah, that sounds good too.

297
00:18:47,224 --> 00:18:49,184
- Want to do it?
- Okay, deal.

298
00:18:49,185 --> 00:18:51,391
She can just tell us any
letter, right?

299
00:18:51,392 --> 00:18:57,959
She can just tell us any letter character,
and we'll have to play with what she says.

300
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,462
Just anything.

301
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:03,610
'K' and 'G'.

302
00:19:04,318 --> 00:19:06,475
Cargo.

303
00:19:07,132 --> 00:19:10,616
- 'K'... and 'G'?
- Okay, then 'Cargo' is right.

304
00:19:12,981 --> 00:19:15,009
Kong Gook!
(Pureed bean soup.)

305

[They get to save their own
camping money.]

308
00:19:25,662 --> 00:19:29,588
- Wait.
- One more game.

309
00:19:29,589 --> 00:19:32,660
- Let's play best out of three.
- We gave you a chance, so give us one.

310
00:19:32,661 --> 00:19:34,860
Let's play one game of our choice.

311
00:19:34,861 --> 00:19:39,770
If we win, then we'll play another round,
but if we lose, then we'll admit our defeat.

312
00:19:39,771 --> 00:19:41,849
- Okay, fine.
- One more round please.

313
00:19:43,401 --> 00:19:46,346
'K' and 'R'.

314
00:19:46,347 --> 00:19:47,868
- Curry.
- Koran.

315
00:19:47,869 --> 00:19:49,349
Cola!

316
00:19:50,749 --> 00:19:53,303
[Joo Hwan just continues to sit there
with a lost expression on his face.]

What are you doing just sitting there?

318
00:19:55,304 --> 00:19:57,489
What are you doing?

319
00:19:57,490 --> 00:19:59,584
'K' and 'R', did you say?

320
00:19:59,585 --> 00:20:02,538
[Who knew that Joo Hwan would be
such a black hole?]

321
00:20:02,539 --> 00:20:05,916
It's like something out of a movie.
Everything just fell perfectly in place!

322

Does that mean...]

[30 minutes ago- Taxi ride.]

324
00:20:18,586 --> 00:20:21,113
- We'll do it when the check comes.
- Propose a game?

325
00:20:21,114 --> 00:20:26,030
How about a quick thinking game?
Like the word game?

326
00:20:26,031 --> 00:20:31,268
Okay, that sounds like a good plan.
Did you see how white Joo Hwan was?

327
00:20:32,444 --> 00:20:35,769
[Completely blank.]

328
00:20:36,753 --> 00:20:39,065
He's so white.
Thanks for the meal.

329
00:20:41,099 --> 00:20:44,223
[Devious Ha Ha and Man Suk.]

330
00:20:52,422 --> 00:20:56,209
How could you not have thought of anything?
There were so many words you could've said.

331
00:20:56,210 --> 00:20:59,451
Curry... and cream!

332
00:20:59,452 --> 00:21:01,245
- Curling.
- Curling!

333
00:21:03,701 --> 00:21:07,885
I know that I have experience on this show,
but you have to choose your opponents wisely.

334
00:21:07,886 --> 00:21:11,479
If you have just enough
wit and plan...

335
00:21:14,611 --> 00:21:16,903
[Back to Gimpo Curling event.]

336
00:21:18,009 --> 00:21:20,804
Let's all just take the 1 PM
flight together.

337
00:21:26,103 --> 00:21:28,715
[The departing time is near!]

338
00:21:31,504 --> 00:21:33,170
No!

339
00:21:37,081 --> 00:21:39,444
Let's go, this is our last chance.

340
00:21:39,445 --> 00:21:41,614
Fighting, Suk Jin!

341
00:21:41,615 --> 00:21:43,272
[Rowing with his hands.]

342
00:21:43,273 --> 00:21:45,707
What are you doing?
Come over here.

343
00:21:47,766 --> 00:21:49,661
Fail.
Back to the starting line.

344
00:21:52,056 --> 00:21:58,010
- Everyone just missed the 10:10 flight.
- Then we have no advantage over others.

345
00:21:59,905 --> 00:22:04,859
[When are we ever going to get to leave
on our camping trip?]

346
00:22:07,148 --> 00:22:11,564
[Yongsan Station- 10:20 train.]

347
00:22:13,805 --> 00:22:18,686
[These campers are in a great mood.
Everyone's talking about the latecomer.]

348
00:22:18,687 --> 00:22:20,338
All he's talking about is Ji Hyo
and her acting skills.

349
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:26,629
He was not just my acting coach,
but he was on my audition panel as well.

350
00:22:27,276 --> 00:22:32,296
He's very famous amongst all the actors.

351
00:22:32,297 --> 00:22:34,611
- Really?
- He's a really great coach.

352
00:22:34,612 --> 00:22:37,821
But he was so busy because everyone
wanted to take his class.

353
00:22:37,822 --> 00:22:42,842
The Seung Soo that I'm familiar with
is when he used to teach his classes.

354
00:22:42,843 --> 00:22:45,668
- My students...
- They didn't really pay for their classes.

355
00:22:45,669 --> 00:22:48,367
I would give them breaks on their fees,
and wait for them to pay when they could.

356
00:22:48,368 --> 00:22:50,956
Who's the most famous former
student of yours?

357
00:22:50,957 --> 00:22:54,181
If I had to name one former student
who's hit it really big...

358
00:22:55,805 --> 00:22:57,320
Right here.

359
00:23:00,003 --> 00:23:02,063
- In Sung?
- Seriously?

360
00:23:02,064 --> 00:23:04,232
- Seriously?
- Jo In Sung?

361
00:23:04,233 --> 00:23:07,599
- In Sung didn't pay his tuition?
- I couldn't take his money.

362
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,265
Because I had a feeling that
he was going to hit it really big.

363
00:23:11,413 --> 00:23:12,922
Because you wanted to be able to use
his name to advertise your classes?

364
00:23:12,923 --> 00:23:14,156
Yeah, pretty much.

365
00:23:14,157 --> 00:23:16,893
You're like an acting coach legend then.

366
00:23:16,894 --> 00:23:21,319
- I'm not sure about that.
- Is this like a lecture or something?

367
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:25,977
It's because he's speaking as if
he's so knowledgeable in his teachings.

368
00:23:25,978 --> 00:23:28,611
You know what he said himself
before the camera started rolling?

369
00:23:28,612 --> 00:23:33,123
'I don't know if I can say this myself,
but I'm a real great acting coach.'

370
00:23:33,124 --> 00:23:36,127
Why aren't you saying that now
that the cameras are rolling?

371
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:40,073
[In truth, the cameras
were rolling at the time.]

372
00:23:40,074 --> 00:23:44,016
The way I see it...
I think I'm the best in this country.

373
00:23:44,017 --> 00:23:46,561
I told you that he's a bit of a goofball.

374
00:23:46,562 --> 00:23:49,928
[Goofball of a coach.]

375
00:23:49,929 --> 00:23:51,704
No, that's not what I meant.

376
00:23:51,705 --> 00:23:53,976
- You have to show a talent for it.
- What do you think of me?

377
00:23:53,977 --> 00:23:55,638
- I see that glint in your eye.
- Seriously?

378
00:23:55,639 --> 00:23:57,183
- What about Lee Sang Hwa?
- What about me?

379
00:23:58,316 --> 00:24:01,029
You're good.
There's depth.

380
00:24:02,989 --> 00:24:05,413
[Definitely a goof.]

381
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:08,735
Didn't I tell you?
He's a total goof.

382
00:24:08,736 --> 00:24:12,377
He's a good guy, but...
Who did you learn your acting skills from?

383
00:24:12,378 --> 00:24:13,699
- Me?
- Yeah.

384
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:16,835
Didn't you have to learn from someone
to be good at what you do?

385
00:24:16,836 --> 00:24:21,137
My teacher was... my own pain...

386
00:24:21,138 --> 00:24:23,425
Stop saying things like that.

387
00:24:23,426 --> 00:24:27,121
[Something smells a bit fishy
about this guy.]

388
00:24:27,122 --> 00:24:31,849
Why are you talking about pain and patience?
You just scarfed down a burger by yourself.

389
00:24:32,377 --> 00:24:36,798
[Goofy Coach Seung Soo couldn't even
endure the pain of hunger on his own.]

390
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:40,404
Since I'm not familiar with this show,
I wasn't sure if we'd get fed or not.

391
00:24:40,405 --> 00:24:44,497
Sang Hwa just told me that she'll have to
start training again in April.

392
00:24:44,498 --> 00:24:47,294
- She said this is her first time on KTX.
- Seriously?

393
00:24:47,295 --> 00:24:49,847
I've never had the chance to ride
on one of these before.

394
00:24:50,662 --> 00:24:52,882
Then do you normally just walk
everywhere?

395
00:24:52,883 --> 00:24:57,443
[Unexpectedly hilarious goofball Seung Soo.]

396
00:24:57,444 --> 00:25:00,584
- Her lower body is so strong.
- It's because of all her training.

397
00:25:00,585 --> 00:25:02,422
[They can't help but laugh
at Seung Soo's words.]

398
00:25:02,423 --> 00:25:04,148
You know what we talked about earlier?

399
00:25:04,149 --> 00:25:10,470
Lee Sang Hwa is impacting the view that women
have of their own body image.

400
00:25:10,471 --> 00:25:13,377
You really do have an impact on how women
are viewing their own bodily image.

401
00:25:13,378 --> 00:25:14,990
We're serious about this.

402
00:25:14,991 --> 00:25:19,292
You know how Sang Hwa listens to music on
her headphones before her competitions?

403
00:25:19,293 --> 00:25:21,228
- She says she listens to my music.
- Yes, I listen to Gary's music.

404
00:25:21,229 --> 00:25:22,909
I thought that you'd be listening
to some upbeat music.

405
00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:29,020
His song, 'Tears', is very good to listen to
when I'm feeling nervous and need to relax.

406
00:25:29,021 --> 00:25:31,622
- That's when I listen to it.
- Really?

407
00:25:31,623 --> 00:25:34,023
[Perfectly matched team.]

408
00:25:38,758 --> 00:25:42,357
[Bus Terminal- 10:45.]

409
00:25:42,949 --> 00:25:48,313
[Getting ready to board the bus even though
they don't know where they're going.]

410
00:25:48,314 --> 00:25:52,135
- Are we going to Gwangjoo?
- You need to take your tickets onboard.

411
00:25:56,658 --> 00:25:58,997
[Haenam]

412
00:25:58,998 --> 00:26:01,096
- Haenam?
- Haenam?

413
00:26:03,311 --> 00:26:06,056
[Confused]

414
00:26:06,528 --> 00:26:08,105
Haenam?

415
00:26:08,106 --> 00:26:11,934
- How long does it take to get to Haenam?
- It takes about five hours to get there.

416
00:26:13,404 --> 00:26:15,765
- Isn't it the southern most part?
- Four hours and 40 minutes?

417
00:26:15,766 --> 00:26:18,854
We're going to the southern most
town of this country?

418
00:26:21,596 --> 00:26:25,243
[Final camping destination-
Haenam in Jeolla-Do.]

419
00:26:26,861 --> 00:26:29,778
[The southernmost tip of the country
is where the campers will be headed.]

420
00:26:29,779 --> 00:26:32,590
- Then Haenam is our final destination?
- I think so.

421
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:34,876
[They finally learn the name of their final
destination three hours into the trip.]

422
00:26:34,877 --> 00:26:39,638
- Then Haenam is our final destination.
- We can't go any further down from there.

423
00:26:40,686 --> 00:26:43,854
Thinking of the four of us being together
at the ends of this earth...

424
00:26:44,404 --> 00:26:46,584
I already feel overwhelmed
by just the sheer thought of it.

425
00:26:46,585 --> 00:26:48,826
- This is my first time going there.
- To Haenam?

426
00:26:49,657 --> 00:26:52,278
[Man Suk still seems confused.]

427
00:26:54,004 --> 00:26:56,978
[11 AM- The bus leaves the terminal.]

428
00:26:56,979 --> 00:26:59,424
- Your first stop will be at a gas station.
- Okay.

429
00:26:59,425 --> 00:27:01,994
- You'll have a mission to complete.
- What is it?

430
00:27:01,995 --> 00:27:05,144
[Bus Teams' first mission.]

431
00:27:06,416 --> 00:27:07,805
<i>Lunch at the gas station.</i>

432
00:27:07,806 --> 00:27:11,050
<i>Roll the die to determine what you'll
have for lunch at the cafeteria counter</i>

433
00:27:11,051 --> 00:27:12,739
<i>and return to the bus as soon as
you finish eating your lunch.</i>

434
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:14,393
We shouldn't have eaten earlier.

435
00:27:15,738 --> 00:27:20,507
You'll see counters that are numbered from
one through seven in the cafeteria area.

436
00:27:20,508 --> 00:27:24,916
You'll have to roll the die to see
which one of the six numbers you land on

437
00:27:24,917 --> 00:27:28,677
and you have to eat everything that the number
lands on and return to the bus when finished.

438
00:27:28,678 --> 00:27:30,703
We shouldn't have eaten.

439
00:27:30,704 --> 00:27:33,975
You will only have 15 minutes
before the bus leaves the gas station.

440
00:27:33,976 --> 00:27:40,184
Whether you're back here or not, the bus
will leave at the end of those 15 minutes.

441
00:27:40,185 --> 00:27:43,327
[The bus will leave regardless of whether
they're back on the bus or not.]

442
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:45,455
Once the bus stops at the gas station

443
00:27:45,456 --> 00:27:47,921
everyone, including the staff members will
have to get off the bus with their belongings.

444
00:27:49,204 --> 00:27:51,105
What if we can't complete the mission
on time?

445
00:27:51,106 --> 00:27:54,893
- That would really be horrible.
- What if we get stuck there?

446
00:27:54,894 --> 00:27:57,287
We should get our money ready.

447
00:27:57,955 --> 00:28:02,015
- Do you know where this train is going?
- Iksan?

448
00:28:02,016 --> 00:28:07,623
This train will arrive in Iksan Station
at exactly 12:17 PM.

449
00:28:07,624 --> 00:28:11,194
The train will stop at the station
for exactly two minutes.

450
00:28:11,567 --> 00:28:13,897
- A mission will be waiting for you there.
- A game?

451
00:28:13,898 --> 00:28:17,473
- Can't we just keep going?
- No, we can't.

452
00:28:18,203 --> 00:28:20,905
Seung Soo's been on a lot of talk shows,
but I think this is his first variety show.

453
00:28:20,906 --> 00:28:22,971
This is my first time
doing anything difficult.

454
00:28:22,972 --> 00:28:25,347
How is this difficult?

455
00:28:25,348 --> 00:28:27,757
[Is it difficult to just sit there
in your seat?]

456
00:28:27,758 --> 00:28:29,982
We're sitting here drinking tea on the train.
What's difficult about that?

457
00:28:30,546 --> 00:28:34,292
- Why do I feel so nervous all of a sudden?
- Don't worry about a thing.

458
00:28:34,293 --> 00:28:38,070
Here's the mission that you'll have to do
at Iksan Station.

459
00:28:38,071 --> 00:28:40,215
There are three teams here currently, correct?

460
00:28:40,264 --> 00:28:41,812
Only two teams will have to get off
the train to complete the mission.

461
00:28:41,813 --> 00:28:45,703
One team won't even have to get off the train,
and just go on to the next station.

462
00:28:45,704 --> 00:28:47,834
- Then we're going to do something here?
- That's correct.

463
00:28:47,835 --> 00:28:51,668
You can decide which game you'll play
onboard right now amongst yourselves.

464
00:28:51,669 --> 00:28:54,050
How about 'The King Game'?

465
00:28:55,821 --> 00:28:59,610
[You expect us to play that
aboard the train?]

466
00:28:59,611 --> 00:29:03,191
I don't think this is the most ideal place
to play that game right now, do you?

467
00:29:03,192 --> 00:29:05,644
This isn't the right place for it.

468
00:29:06,810 --> 00:29:11,910
[How does he expect to play that game
aboard the moving train?]

469
00:29:14,115 --> 00:29:16,057
- How about 'Noonchi' game?
- That's a good game to play.

470
00:29:16,058 --> 00:29:18,604
- Okay, noonchi game.
- One!

471
00:29:18,605 --> 00:29:19,833
Two.

472
00:29:21,228 --> 00:29:25,413
Seriously, what is wrong with you?
We have to agree on it first.

473
00:29:25,414 --> 00:29:27,801
- Don't you know how to play this game?
- Three.

474
00:29:27,802 --> 00:29:30,025
- Four.
- Five.

475
00:29:31,813 --> 00:29:34,144
[Jae Suk loses for now.]

476
00:29:34,145 --> 00:29:36,216
[He seems delighted at Jae Suk's loss.]

477
00:29:36,217 --> 00:29:37,386
You shouldn't be so happy about that.
You two are on the same team.

478
00:29:37,387 --> 00:29:39,157
We're on the same team!

479
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:44,096
[This man simply just enjoyed
playing the game.]

480
00:29:44,097 --> 00:29:47,768
We're in this predicament because
you got the ball rolling when I wasn't ready.

481
00:29:47,769 --> 00:29:50,764
[Thanks to Seung Soo's efforts,
Jae Suk and Seung Soo will have to get off.]

482
00:29:50,765 --> 00:29:52,533
Seriously, Ryu Seung Soo.

483
00:29:52,534 --> 00:29:55,820
As for you two teams,
how about just drawing a straw?

484
00:29:55,821 --> 00:29:58,342
[Draw of the star to determine which of
the two teams will have to get off.]

485
00:29:58,343 --> 00:30:01,551
The team that draws the short straw will
have to get off at the Iksan Station with us.

486
00:30:02,263 --> 00:30:05,545
[Sang Hwa to draw first.]

487
00:30:10,072 --> 00:30:11,591
[That's awfully short.]

488
00:30:15,084 --> 00:30:17,701
[Ji Hyo and Dong Jun are safe.]

489
00:30:17,702 --> 00:30:21,454
[Wins without any effort on their part.]

490
00:30:21,455 --> 00:30:23,380
Song Ji Hyo and Dong Jun...
you two are so lucky.

491
00:30:23,381 --> 00:30:26,972
I can't believe you drew it right away.

492
00:30:29,651 --> 00:30:32,475
Wow, I can't believe that was
the first draw.

493
00:30:34,296 --> 00:30:36,054
[The short straw!]

494
00:30:37,825 --> 00:30:40,552
He can't seem to do anything right either.

495
00:30:40,553 --> 00:30:43,558
[Could he also be another
Icon of Misfortune?]

496
00:30:44,727 --> 00:30:48,866
[Four minutes before
their stop at Iksan Station.]

497
00:30:49,839 --> 00:30:52,223
- Take your belongings off with you.
- Okay.

498
00:30:52,224 --> 00:30:54,985
But it's no big deal,
because we'll come back onboard.

499
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:59,098
The way you're packing your bags makes you
look like you're not planning on returning.

500
00:30:59,099 --> 00:31:01,820
[Not anticipating to come back?]

501
00:31:02,726 --> 00:31:04,971
I have a bad feeling about this.

502
00:31:06,272 --> 00:31:10,406
Since I don't know what may happen,
can you take a picture of me with Sang Hwa?

503
00:31:11,030 --> 00:31:14,809
[A new variety star has risen.]

504
00:31:14,810 --> 00:31:18,103
- What are you doing?
- I don't know when I'll get to see her again.

505
00:31:18,104 --> 00:31:20,503
- Seriously.
- I may not see her again.

506
00:31:20,504 --> 00:31:22,679
This isn't the end of the episode.

507
00:31:26,269 --> 00:31:28,945
[This may be the end for us.]

508
00:31:31,161 --> 00:31:33,854
- See you later.
- We'll be back.

509
00:31:33,855 --> 00:31:35,807
[Really hoping to return.]

510
00:31:39,372 --> 00:31:43,154
[Jae Suk and Seung Soo vs
Gary and Sang Hwa.]

511
00:31:45,333 --> 00:31:47,030
[Extreme state of nervousness.]

512
00:31:47,985 --> 00:31:49,777
- Mission will start as soon as you get off.
- Okay.

513
00:31:49,779 --> 00:31:53,116
[Roll the die and one of the two teams
will have to stay behind.]

514
00:31:56,025 --> 00:31:57,943
Let's go!

515
00:31:59,192 --> 00:32:01,439
[Jae Suk and Seung Soo to roll first.]

516
00:32:04,167 --> 00:32:08,004
[Back on the train or stay behind?]

517
00:32:10,099 --> 00:32:15,650
[Who will the smile upon?]

518
00:32:20,696 --> 00:32:24,137
[Jae Suk and Seung Soo to board
back on the train!]

519
00:32:25,627 --> 00:32:29,616
[If they get 'Board' as well,
then it'll be a rematch.]

520
00:32:34,167 --> 00:32:37,031
[Gary and Sang Hwa to stay behind.]

521
00:32:40,781 --> 00:32:42,192
What was that?

522
00:32:42,193 --> 00:32:44,199
[The sinner]

523
00:32:44,721 --> 00:32:47,286
[See you later!]

524
00:32:48,037 --> 00:32:50,665
[Annoyed]

525
00:32:50,666 --> 00:32:53,395
[Sorry]

526
00:32:53,396 --> 00:32:55,401
Why didn't that work?

527
00:32:58,513 --> 00:33:00,565
- What the heck!
- We just got it!

528
00:33:01,725 --> 00:33:03,965
What do we do now?

529
00:33:03,966 --> 00:33:06,267
[Taking her anger out on the die.]

530
00:33:07,997 --> 00:33:09,384
That was awesome.

531
00:33:16,533 --> 00:33:19,637
[I guess this must be the end for us.]

532
00:33:20,033 --> 00:33:21,938
I'm going to get my revenge!

533
00:33:24,211 --> 00:33:26,609
I'm going to get my revenge!

534
00:33:27,689 --> 00:33:31,094
Don't go!
Don't go!

535
00:33:32,943 --> 00:33:36,207
[Gold medalist's tragedy.]

536
00:33:36,208 --> 00:33:39,723
As for the two of you, you'll have
to go to Gwangjoo bus terminal.

537
00:33:39,724 --> 00:33:42,715
[Must find their own way to
Gwangjoo bus terminal.]

538
00:33:46,495 --> 00:33:50,477
[Jae Suk is calling the Plane Teams to
let them know of their status.]

539
00:33:51,573 --> 00:33:53,767
Are you guys on your way?
Kim Jong Kook's there too?

540
00:33:53,883 --> 00:33:56,975
- We're still at the airport.
- Seriously.

541
00:33:56,976 --> 00:34:00,183
Why are you wearing those headphones around
when you're not even listening to music?

542
00:34:00,184 --> 00:34:01,881
[The headphones are just
a fashion accessory.]

543
00:34:02,577 --> 00:34:05,015
Isn't that Lee Hyori?

544
00:34:05,016 --> 00:34:09,611
[What?
It really is Lee Hyori!]

545
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:11,352
Hey!

546
00:34:12,612 --> 00:34:16,924
[Ran into Hyori at the airport
by pure coincidence.]

547
00:34:16,925 --> 00:34:19,632
- Hi, Ji Hyo.
- This is awesome.

548
00:34:19,633 --> 00:34:22,094
I can't believe we ran into her.

549
00:34:24,001 --> 00:34:26,358
What are you doing there, Hyori?

550
00:34:27,009 --> 00:34:28,995
She says she's heading home
to Jeju Island.

551
00:34:28,996 --> 00:34:31,653
[Hyori is headed back to her
newlywed's home on Jeju Island.]

552
00:34:31,654 --> 00:34:34,915
- Were you in Gwangjoo?
- No, I'm in Seoul.

553
00:34:34,916 --> 00:34:37,165
We're still in Seoul!

554
00:34:39,293 --> 00:34:41,127
We didn't make our flight.

555
00:34:41,128 --> 00:34:43,297
[These two teams haven't made it
to their campsite yet.]

556
00:34:43,298 --> 00:34:45,699
What are you still doing there instead
of heading to your destination?

557
00:34:46,568 --> 00:34:48,778
This superstar is going to
head out now.

558
00:34:53,026 --> 00:34:54,853
Bye, Superstar!

559
00:34:54,854 --> 00:34:58,648
I can't believe that was Hyori.
She's heading to Jeju Island.

560
00:34:58,649 --> 00:35:01,283
Okay, I'll see you guys later.

561
00:35:01,284 --> 00:35:03,059
- Okay.
- Bye.

562
00:35:05,983 --> 00:35:10,673
[Finally getting to board their
1 PM flight.]

563
00:35:11,897 --> 00:35:15,140
[The Plane Teams are finally
getting started on their trip.]

564
00:35:23,019 --> 00:35:25,024
I feel like we're going on an MT.

565
00:35:28,931 --> 00:35:32,176
<i>We will take a brief 15 minute break
at the next gas station.</i>

566
00:35:35,288 --> 00:35:40,010
[Approaching their designated gas station.]

567
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:47,457
[If they don't make it back within
15 minutes, then they'll be left behind.]

568
00:35:53,741 --> 00:35:55,444
Jae Suk.

569
00:35:55,445 --> 00:35:57,533
We're about to start our mission.

570
00:35:57,534 --> 00:35:59,633
We already finished our mission.

571
00:35:59,634 --> 00:36:01,172
[The ease of a victor.]

572
00:36:01,173 --> 00:36:03,013
Who lost?

573
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,655
- Gary must've lost.
- Gary and Sang Hwa.

574
00:36:07,252 --> 00:36:09,647
You saw that, right?

575
00:36:09,648 --> 00:36:12,430
- This is what happens.
- We have to go!

576
00:36:12,431 --> 00:36:14,681
[There's no time to waste.]

577
00:36:17,178 --> 00:36:18,861
Are we going to start now?

578
00:36:18,862 --> 00:36:20,708
Come on, let's go!
We have to run.

579
00:36:23,971 --> 00:36:29,374
[The bus will leave in exactly
15 minutes.]

580
00:36:30,692 --> 00:36:32,232
To the right!

581
00:36:33,116 --> 00:36:35,523
[Joo Hwan is the first one to arrive.]

582
00:36:35,524 --> 00:36:36,999
- What do we have to do?
- Is this where we order?

583
00:36:38,026 --> 00:36:39,310
We'll take a number two combo.

584
00:36:39,311 --> 00:36:42,592
[His roll of the die determined combo
number two for Kwang Soo and Joo Hwa.]

585
00:36:42,593 --> 00:36:45,732
- 7,000 won!
- Dduk galbi steak?

586
00:36:45,733 --> 00:36:48,664
- We need number six!
- Wait! We have to finish ours first.

587
00:36:49,557 --> 00:36:52,342
[Once comrades on the bus
are now enemies out in the open.]

588
00:36:53,266 --> 00:36:55,605
- Okay, I'll take it.
- Two minutes have already passed.

589
00:36:55,606 --> 00:36:56,867
[Ha Ha and Man Suk's combo number six.]

590
00:36:58,372 --> 00:37:01,300
[Ha Ha and Man Suk are losing precious time.]

591
00:37:01,301 --> 00:37:03,573
- We've only got 12 minutes left.
- No need for it to be hot.

592
00:37:03,574 --> 00:37:05,168
You can just give it to us raw.

593
00:37:05,169 --> 00:37:08,244
- What did we just order?
- It's kalguksoo.

594
00:37:08,245 --> 00:37:13,830
Kalguksoo? You don't
have to give us very much of it.

595
00:37:14,686 --> 00:37:17,450
We don't need any soup with it.

596
00:37:17,855 --> 00:37:21,654
[The dduk galbi steak is out first.]

597
00:37:22,750 --> 00:37:25,554
How about right here?
I'll go get us some water.

598
00:37:28,171 --> 00:37:31,716
[Kwang Soo is getting some water for them
so that they can eat their food faster.]

599
00:37:34,192 --> 00:37:36,247
[Joo Hwan is cutting up all the meat
into bite sized pieces.]

600
00:37:39,992 --> 00:37:42,364
[A big bite of the piping hot steak.]

601
00:37:49,049 --> 00:37:51,374
I think those guys are
already eating.

602
00:37:51,375 --> 00:37:55,232
- Can you cook it any faster?
- It's almost ready.

603
00:37:56,677 --> 00:37:59,295
[Just like how a giraffe would eat
the leaves on a tree...]

604
00:38:04,010 --> 00:38:05,718
It's really good.

605
00:38:09,501 --> 00:38:11,804
[Choking on the delicious food.]

606
00:38:15,568 --> 00:38:18,971
[To save time, Ha Ha and Man Suk's food
is divided up into two separate bowls.]

607
00:38:19,933 --> 00:38:21,641
Thank you.

608
00:38:24,725 --> 00:38:28,224
Let's sit right here.
She already divided it up for us.

609
00:38:28,834 --> 00:38:30,891
It's much hotter than it looks.

610
00:38:34,174 --> 00:38:39,089
[Hot or not... it's time to eat!]

611
00:38:39,631 --> 00:38:42,655
[The scalding hot noodles are being felt
throughout their whole bodies.]

612
00:38:47,634 --> 00:38:50,109
[Why are you looking at your phone
when you have to quickly finish your meal?]

613
00:38:57,574 --> 00:38:59,533
We're finished!

614
00:38:59,534 --> 00:39:02,801
- Okay, mission clear!
- Yes! Thank you!

615
00:39:03,692 --> 00:39:09,244
[Only once they're back on the bus,
will they truly succeed.]

616
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:12,095
We're in the midst of doing our mission!

617
00:39:12,096 --> 00:39:15,058
[Is he talking to Ji Hyo
on the phone right now?]

618
00:39:17,391 --> 00:39:18,823
Our bus!

619
00:39:18,824 --> 00:39:20,707
Where did the bus go?

620
00:39:20,708 --> 00:39:22,971
It's not there!

621
00:39:22,972 --> 00:39:26,904
[The bus... isn't there?]

622
00:39:27,634 --> 00:39:30,193
[Could it have taken off already?]

623
00:39:31,465 --> 00:39:33,993
[Blindly searching for their bus.]

624
00:39:35,950 --> 00:39:39,658
[Same looking buses
as far as their eyes can see.]

625
00:39:40,939 --> 00:39:43,575
[Ha Ha and Man Suk are
still busy eating their food.]

626
00:39:46,054 --> 00:39:48,321
[That's so hot!]

627
00:39:51,219 --> 00:39:53,307
[Finally finishes their meal!]

628
00:39:53,471 --> 00:39:55,368
Are you sure that this is our bus?

629
00:39:55,373 --> 00:39:58,890
[Which one is our bus?]

630
00:39:58,891 --> 00:40:00,455
No, that's not the one!

631
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:07,380
[Did it really leave and abandon us?]

632
00:40:11,491 --> 00:40:12,933
Kwang Soo!

633
00:40:13,890 --> 00:40:17,309
Kwang Soo!

634
00:40:19,598 --> 00:40:21,369
I think it's down that row!

635
00:40:21,370 --> 00:40:23,193
Why did it park so far away?

636
00:40:23,194 --> 00:40:26,093
[Did they find their bus?]

637
00:40:27,256 --> 00:40:32,348
[The truth is...]

638
00:40:36,357 --> 00:40:39,297
[The bus moved to another spot
as soon as the members were dropped off.]

639
00:40:43,957 --> 00:40:47,288
Why are they running so fast?
What if the bus is about to leave?

640
00:40:47,289 --> 00:40:48,946
No way!

641
00:40:51,432 --> 00:40:52,884
- Which one is it?
- Haenam.

642
00:40:53,914 --> 00:40:57,654
[Kwang Soo and Joo Hwan succeed
in getting back on the bus.]

643
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:07,390
[Whew... we made it.]

644
00:41:07,391 --> 00:41:08,855
Are you okay?

645
00:41:09,626 --> 00:41:12,186
[Ha Ha is running around blindly
in search of the bus.]

646
00:41:14,538 --> 00:41:16,032
Only one minute left on the clock.

647
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:19,658
[Only one minute left!]

648
00:41:20,870 --> 00:41:24,168
[What will become of Ha Ha
and Man Suk's fate?]

649
00:41:28,036 --> 00:41:33,077
[1:23 PM. The Train Teams
arrive at Gwangjoo Station.]

650
00:41:33,078 --> 00:41:35,169
We'll see you later!

651
00:41:37,137 --> 00:41:41,774
[Next destination- Gwangju bus station.]

652
00:41:41,775 --> 00:41:43,359
- We have to run?
- Of course.

653
00:41:44,382 --> 00:41:49,339
[A huge advantage to the team that arrives
at the camping site first.]

654
00:41:51,911 --> 00:41:54,206
You are such a sly little fox.

655
00:41:54,207 --> 00:41:58,263
[Gwangjoo bus terminal.]

656
00:42:00,774 --> 00:42:02,571
I see something!

657
00:42:05,817 --> 00:42:07,889
Stop running!

658
00:42:10,679 --> 00:42:12,220
We're here.

659
00:42:12,221 --> 00:42:16,083
- Both members have to arrive together.
- Come on, Seung Soo!

660
00:42:16,997 --> 00:42:20,091
[Lost their place all thanks to
Seung Soo and his slow pace.]

661
00:42:20,092 --> 00:42:22,386
They beat us because
you took too long to get here.

662
00:42:22,387 --> 00:42:25,291
- Is that how it works?
- What?

663
00:42:25,292 --> 00:42:26,903
We have to travel together?

664
00:42:30,357 --> 00:42:32,393
[Mission cards are handed out.]

665
00:42:32,821 --> 00:42:34,110
<i>The trust game.</i>

666
00:42:34,111 --> 00:42:38,009
<i>Roll the die and complete the mission
within the allotted time to win.</i>

667
00:42:39,179 --> 00:42:42,406
- What are we doing?
- We have to roll the die.

668
00:42:42,407 --> 00:42:45,343
[A random game of rolling the die,
and leaving it up to fate.]

669
00:42:50,697 --> 00:42:52,987
[Ji Hyo and Dong Jun- Game number six.]

670
00:42:52,988 --> 00:42:55,599
[No drinking of any water
after eating spicy food.]

671
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:01,775
[No drinking of any water
after eating spicy food.]

672
00:43:01,776 --> 00:43:04,592
You have to finish the spicy rice cakes
within two minutes.

673
00:43:04,593 --> 00:43:07,966
And you cannot drink any water
for two whole minutes.

674
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:10,818
That's pretty easy.

675
00:43:10,819 --> 00:43:13,729
No matter how spicy it is,
you can endure it for two minutes.

676
00:43:14,561 --> 00:43:16,718
- Are you good at eating spicy foods?
- Yes.

677
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:20,065
[Dong Jun confesses his love
for spicy foods.]

678
00:43:20,066 --> 00:43:21,864
- Yes, I love spicy foods.
- I doubt you can handle this kind of spice.

679
00:43:25,061 --> 00:43:27,177
How spicy can this be?

680
00:43:27,178 --> 00:43:31,363
- I'm not good at eating spicy foods.
- No, Ji Hyo can't. This is great.

681
00:43:32,648 --> 00:43:35,182
- Can you just back off?
- What did you say?

682
00:43:35,183 --> 00:43:38,142
- I have to play this game right now.
- Seriously.

683
00:43:38,143 --> 00:43:40,622
You can move onto the next stage
as soon as you succeed the mission.

684
00:43:42,542 --> 00:43:44,242
Here's a bottle of water for you.

685
00:43:45,268 --> 00:43:49,092
[A mean trick on his part
when they can't drink any water.]

686
00:43:51,470 --> 00:43:54,174
[Cruel Yoo Bratty Suk.]

687
00:43:56,118 --> 00:43:58,646
[Spicy ddukboki game- Start.]

688
00:44:00,474 --> 00:44:03,646
I can't believe you got that game.
You don't feel the heat when you eat it.

689
00:44:03,647 --> 00:44:06,668
- But it'll hit all at once!
- I feel it!

690
00:44:08,682 --> 00:44:12,622
[A full avalanche of the heat.]

691
00:44:17,524 --> 00:44:20,620
[Getting teary in the eye.]

692
00:44:22,002 --> 00:44:25,098
[Thought you said you were good at
eating spicy foods?]

693
00:44:29,590 --> 00:44:32,391
I can smell the spice emanating
from you.

694
00:44:32,392 --> 00:44:35,965
[The spiciness of the dish is pouring out
from every single one of their pores.]

695
00:44:37,540 --> 00:44:40,521
[A huge mouthful.]

696
00:44:40,522 --> 00:44:42,602
That's what a trust game is all about.

697
00:44:43,336 --> 00:44:46,379
That's how you need to play it, okay?

698
00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:49,076
[Regretting his show of chivalry.]

699
00:44:49,856 --> 00:44:51,611
Here's some water.
Drink some water, Ji Hyo.

700
00:44:51,612 --> 00:44:55,220
Here, have some water.
There you go, drink it.

701
00:44:57,070 --> 00:44:59,283
[Here's your water!]

702
00:44:59,284 --> 00:45:02,865
[Shower of water is her response
to his bratty remarks.]

703
00:45:05,085 --> 00:45:07,515
[Spicy food lover, Dong Jun,
finishes up the dish.]

704
00:45:08,630 --> 00:45:12,434
[The spiciness of the dish is making them
breakout into an automatic dance.]

705
00:45:14,203 --> 00:45:17,681
[Must whistle after finished eating
to succeed the mission.]

706
00:45:20,432 --> 00:45:21,856
I can't hear it.

707
00:45:22,756 --> 00:45:25,520
- I can't whistle.
- It's because it's too hot. Drink some water.

708
00:45:28,086 --> 00:45:30,762
Seriously!
Song Ji Hyo and her hot temper!

709
00:45:30,763 --> 00:45:34,577
You really are something.
Drink some water first.

710
00:45:34,578 --> 00:45:37,226
[What is he doing?]

711
00:45:37,912 --> 00:45:39,242
Let me try it one more time.

712
00:45:39,243 --> 00:45:41,993
Why do you keep backing away?

713
00:45:41,994 --> 00:45:43,927
[I can't do that.]

714
00:45:46,574 --> 00:45:49,657
[Time over- Fail.]

715
00:45:49,658 --> 00:45:51,824
Just because you couldn't whistle?

716
00:45:51,825 --> 00:45:55,586
[Nonstop chattering of his
bratty comments.]

717
00:45:55,587 --> 00:45:57,386
Why don't you give it a try?

718
00:45:57,387 --> 00:45:59,086
[We'll say that Dong Jun isn't very good
at eating spicy foods.]

719
00:45:59,087 --> 00:46:00,686
Okay, we'll take our turn.

720
00:46:00,687 --> 00:46:02,323
[Jae Suk and Seung Soo's turn.]

721
00:46:04,873 --> 00:46:07,346
[What's game number three?]

722
00:46:08,828 --> 00:46:14,215
[Stand the flag in their hands for three
full minutes without collapsing to succeed.]

723
00:46:14,216 --> 00:46:16,863
- Hang on.
- We'll start the clock now.

724
00:46:17,540 --> 00:46:20,264
[Seung Soo takes his turn first.]

725
00:46:20,265 --> 00:46:22,729
I think we might be able to do this.

726
00:46:23,748 --> 00:46:28,141
[Goofball Seung Soo is better
than expected!]

727
00:46:30,327 --> 00:46:31,994
What's going on here?

728
00:46:35,253 --> 00:46:37,612
How's the time?

729
00:46:38,362 --> 00:46:40,221
It's only been 20 seconds?

730
00:46:41,466 --> 00:46:44,018
[Time never moves when you need it to.]

731
00:46:44,019 --> 00:46:45,868
Where are you going?

732
00:46:45,869 --> 00:46:47,554
Don't make me laugh.

733
00:46:50,236 --> 00:46:52,674
Okay, we're good.
We may get this done in one shot.

734
00:46:52,675 --> 00:46:53,934
[Succeed at their first attempt?]

735
00:46:53,935 --> 00:46:55,856
[I can't let that happen!]

736
00:46:56,824 --> 00:46:59,058
[Delinquent Blank Ji is on the move!]

737
00:46:59,892 --> 00:47:02,938
What are you doing?
What do you think you're doing?

738
00:47:02,939 --> 00:47:04,702
Hey!

739
00:47:05,452 --> 00:47:08,298
[Succeeds in her interference plans.]

740
00:47:08,299 --> 00:47:10,692
What! Why don't you
try the spicy ddukbokki too?

741
00:47:10,693 --> 00:47:13,326
- See if you can stay sane after eating it!
- Seriously.

742
00:47:14,132 --> 00:47:18,013
[Delinquent Blank Ji Hyo is fully unleashed
after eating the hottest food she's ever had.]

743
00:47:18,408 --> 00:47:21,322
His time was, 55 seconds.

744
00:47:21,323 --> 00:47:25,484
Jae Suk needs a total of two minutes and
five seconds to succeed the mission.

745
00:47:28,242 --> 00:47:30,327
[Jae Suk's turn.]

746
00:47:30,940 --> 00:47:32,919
[Huh?]

747
00:47:35,999 --> 00:47:39,337
[Are you here to samba?]

748
00:47:39,338 --> 00:47:41,834
[His dancing legs know no boundaries.]

749
00:47:42,808 --> 00:47:45,612
[His partner for the day- The flag.]

750
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:51,032
[Drops his partner to the ground
after only a few seconds.]

751
00:47:51,033 --> 00:47:52,915
Get out of the way!

752
00:47:52,916 --> 00:47:55,449
Where am I?
Who am I?

753
00:47:55,450 --> 00:47:58,325
[Blank Ji still can't get herself together.]

754
00:47:58,326 --> 00:48:00,331
Yoo Jae Suk's time is, nine seconds.

755
00:48:01,248 --> 00:48:04,357
With the total time of one minute and
nine seconds, you failed the mission.

756
00:48:04,358 --> 00:48:08,558
- You were doing so well too.
- I think I could've done all three minutes.

757
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:10,593
You're really good at this game.

758
00:48:10,594 --> 00:48:13,045
- You did really good.
- What?

759
00:48:13,046 --> 00:48:16,502
What did you just say?
Why are you crying?

760
00:48:16,503 --> 00:48:18,686
Why are you crying on a variety show?

761
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:21,167
What's going on here?
Sang Hwa's here!

762
00:48:21,168 --> 00:48:24,479
[Just then, Sang Hwa and Gary
arrive at the terminal!]

763
00:48:25,148 --> 00:48:30,323
[12:19- Abandoned at Iksan Station.]

764
00:48:30,324 --> 00:48:34,044
[12:34- Arrives at Iksan bus station.]

765
00:48:34,045 --> 00:48:39,797
[12:35- Boards the bus to Gwangjoo.]

766
00:48:39,798 --> 00:48:44,625
[2:01- Arrives at Gwangju bus terminal.]

767
00:48:44,626 --> 00:48:49,844
[They rushed over to the terminal
without wasting even a single second.]

768
00:48:50,670 --> 00:48:53,023
- How did you guys get here?
- We took the bus.

769
00:48:53,024 --> 00:48:55,025
- We found a bus immediately.
- Seriously?

770
00:48:55,026 --> 00:48:56,576
- You took the bus?
- Fighting!

771
00:48:56,577 --> 00:48:59,446
- My stomach hurts right now.
- Mine too.

772
00:48:59,447 --> 00:49:02,878
[Let's avoid game number six!]

773
00:49:11,407 --> 00:49:14,954
[As soon as number six turns up...
she gets rid of the evidence.]

774
00:49:14,955 --> 00:49:18,207
[A shocking kicking talent.]

775
00:49:18,208 --> 00:49:21,302
- You got number six. I saw it.
- No, it wasn't number six.

776
00:49:21,303 --> 00:49:24,454
- I saw it. It was number six.
- No, it wasn't!

777
00:49:24,455 --> 00:49:28,327
[I can't eat any more of it!]

778
00:49:28,328 --> 00:49:30,308
It was number six.

779
00:49:30,309 --> 00:49:32,308
It was six.
You got number six again.

780
00:49:33,388 --> 00:49:36,736
It was six, for sure...
but we'll give them a break.

781
00:49:36,737 --> 00:49:38,770
- Thank you.
- No, don't mention it.

782
00:49:40,053 --> 00:49:41,468
You guys worked so hard earlier.

783
00:49:41,469 --> 00:49:44,520
- I'm here too.
- Okay, I hear you.

784
00:49:46,350 --> 00:49:49,162
[Number four.]

785
00:49:49,163 --> 00:49:53,386
We can't do that right now.
I'm still short of breath from the spicy food.

786
00:49:54,210 --> 00:49:55,344
For how long?

787
00:49:55,379 --> 00:49:57,900
- Three minutes? I'll do it.
- He's going to do all three minutes himself?

788
00:49:57,901 --> 00:50:00,023
- Dong Jun's doing all three minutes?
- No, a total of three minutes.

789
00:50:00,024 --> 00:50:03,064
- To dunk his face underwater?
- Dong Jun will be dead after three minutes.

790
00:50:03,381 --> 00:50:06,448
[We're just explaining the rules...]

791
00:50:06,449 --> 00:50:08,418
It's not like Dong Jun is a fish.

792
00:50:08,419 --> 00:50:11,584
[Their combined time must be three minutes
for them to succeed the mission.]

793
00:50:11,585 --> 00:50:13,518
- Who would like to go first?
- I'll go first.

794
00:50:14,121 --> 00:50:17,932
- Wow, Dong Jun.
- He's just overly zealous right now!

795
00:50:17,933 --> 00:50:20,904
I thought you said you were good
at eating spicy foods too!

796
00:50:21,342 --> 00:50:25,143
[Makes up the difference of wanting to be good
and actually being good with enthusiasm.]

797
00:50:25,144 --> 00:50:27,839
- I can hold my breath for a really long time.
- Really?

798
00:50:31,246 --> 00:50:32,963
Doesn't that make you dizzy?

799
00:50:33,934 --> 00:50:36,301
- That's going to make you dizzy.
- You're supposed to do that only three times.

800
00:50:37,894 --> 00:50:39,574
Ugh, I feel dizzy.

801
00:50:39,575 --> 00:50:42,366
What are you doing, Dong Jun?

802
00:50:42,367 --> 00:50:47,010
[The rice cakes must've been
really spicy...]

803
00:50:47,438 --> 00:50:50,122
Okay, give it a try.
Don't even think about lifting up your head.

804
00:50:55,106 --> 00:50:57,547
[Enthusiastic Dong Jun dunks his
head in with confidence.]

805
00:50:58,105 --> 00:51:00,758
[What?]

806
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:10,589
[Overly enthusiastic,
Three-second Dong Jun.]

807
00:51:10,590 --> 00:51:13,228
What are you doing right now, Dong Jun?

808
00:51:13,229 --> 00:51:16,112
- Here's a towel, Dong Jun.
- What just happened?

809
00:51:16,113 --> 00:51:18,650
What is the matter with you?

810
00:51:18,651 --> 00:51:22,325
[You really are a strange child...]

811
00:51:22,687 --> 00:51:26,716
- Just who are you, Dong Jun?
- He has nothing but enthusiasm.

812
00:51:26,717 --> 00:51:29,634
You have to stay underwater
for two minutes and 57 seconds.

813
00:51:30,254 --> 00:51:32,376
Think of yourself as the mermaid princess.

814
00:51:32,377 --> 00:51:35,038
Ji Hyo, I'm sorry.

815
00:51:35,073 --> 00:51:38,390
He's sorry...
Dong Jun says that he's sorry.

816
00:51:39,552 --> 00:51:41,467
You're adorable, Dong Jun.

817
00:51:43,422 --> 00:51:46,318
[Blank Ji makes her attempt to stay
submerged for two minutes and 57 seconds.]

818
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:53,427
She doesn't submerge her face too deep.
She's so smart.

819
00:51:53,428 --> 00:51:56,009
[Cleverly dips it just slightly in the water.]

820
00:51:56,010 --> 00:51:58,723
She needs to stay underwater for
two minutes and 57 seconds.

821
00:51:58,724 --> 00:52:01,393
Dong Jun, three seconds
really was pretty shocking.

822
00:52:01,394 --> 00:52:04,580
- My nose was running from the food.
- Really?

823
00:52:08,409 --> 00:52:10,783
- The time really goes by slow.
- Goes really slow at times like these.

824
00:52:10,784 --> 00:52:14,506
- Knowing the time...
- Would you like for us to tell you?

825
00:52:14,507 --> 00:52:16,500
Yes, please tell us.
That'll make her feel very anxious.

826
00:52:17,990 --> 00:52:20,282
Ji Hyo's listening to everything
that we're saying right now.

827
00:52:20,283 --> 00:52:22,434
Ji Hyo really is lasting
a long time in the water.

828
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:27,096
A minute has passed.

829
00:52:28,588 --> 00:52:32,313
If Dong Jun could've stayed
at least a minute...

830
00:52:35,284 --> 00:52:37,464
I can't believe how long you're lasting.

831
00:52:37,465 --> 00:52:41,208
- I think she's still breathing somehow.
- No, she really is underwater.

832
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:48,080
You're so much better now that you've
quit drinking and smoking.

833
00:52:48,081 --> 00:52:50,270
I just saw her laugh a bit.

834
00:52:56,572 --> 00:52:58,560
Ji Hyo couldn't hold back her laughter
on that comment.

835
00:52:58,561 --> 00:53:00,594
You have to protect me, Sang Hwa.

836
00:53:00,595 --> 00:53:03,300
Ji Hyo couldn't ignore that comment.

837
00:53:03,948 --> 00:53:07,223
[A comment even Mermaid Blank Ji
couldn't ignore.]

838
00:53:07,224 --> 00:53:10,379
Your combined total time is...
one minute and 55 seconds.

839
00:53:10,380 --> 00:53:15,673
Wow, that really is too bad.
You did 1 minute 52 seconds by yourself.

840
00:53:15,674 --> 00:53:19,748
Ji Hyo, you did one minute and
52 seconds all by yourself.

841
00:53:19,749 --> 00:53:23,143
- Dong Jun only got three seconds.
- He's got nothing but enthusiasm.

842
00:53:24,131 --> 00:53:25,984
[I'm sorry, Ji Hyo.
From, Enthusiastic Kim.]

843
00:53:29,493 --> 00:53:31,273
There's only a minute left.

844
00:53:31,274 --> 00:53:32,725
[Back at the gas station.]

845
00:53:32,726 --> 00:53:36,540
[One minute before departure time.]

846
00:53:37,901 --> 00:53:47,995
[With the honor of our team on the line...
we can't get left behind here.]

847
00:53:47,996 --> 00:53:50,109
I guarantee that they're going to fail.

848
00:53:50,110 --> 00:53:51,733
[Kwang Soo is guaranteeing
Ha Ha and Man Suk's failure.]

849
00:53:51,734 --> 00:53:59,053
[But just then... the other
team makes it in the nick of time!]

850
00:54:01,273 --> 00:54:04,053
[We should've left them in our dust...]

851
00:54:04,891 --> 00:54:08,937
[Ha Ha and Man Suk were taking their sweet time
because they didn't know the bus had moved.]

852
00:54:08,938 --> 00:54:10,628
Where are they going?

853
00:54:11,079 --> 00:54:14,202
[They got lucky when they accidentally
happened to see Kwang Soo in the distance.]

854
00:54:16,274 --> 00:54:19,546
Why are they in such a rush?
What if the bus is about to take off?

855
00:54:19,547 --> 00:54:21,101
No way!

856
00:54:21,102 --> 00:54:25,890
[They sense something is off,
and take off hot on Kwang Soo's trail.]

857
00:54:27,891 --> 00:54:31,969
[They were able to make it back safely
riding on Giraffe's tail.]

858
00:54:34,373 --> 00:54:35,816
We were neck and neck.

859
00:54:40,569 --> 00:54:43,268
Both teams succeeded their mission,
and we will head off to our next destination.

860
00:54:43,269 --> 00:54:45,580
[Both succeeded their mission,
and off to their next destination!]

861
00:54:45,581 --> 00:54:47,282
Great job.

862
00:54:47,949 --> 00:54:50,151
[That was our chance to
get rid of them.]

863
00:54:53,652 --> 00:54:58,582
[The bus with the two of the most infamous
traitors are back on the road again.]

864
00:55:00,283 --> 00:55:03,617
[Gwangjoo bus terminal-
Back to Jae Suk and Seung Soo's turn.]

865
00:55:03,618 --> 00:55:04,845
Okay, here we go.

866
00:55:07,767 --> 00:55:09,519
- No, this isn't what I meant to do.
- Number one.

867
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:13,072
[Accidentally drops the die.]

868
00:55:13,073 --> 00:55:15,388
[Jae Suk and Seung Soo are stuck with
Game number one.]

869
00:55:15,532 --> 00:55:19,262
[Cone sitting.]

870
00:55:19,263 --> 00:55:22,252
I have... a very bad condition
back there.

871
00:55:23,094 --> 00:55:26,745
[The cone that we're speaking of is...]

872
00:55:27,604 --> 00:55:34,486
[The very cone that brought RM members down
in crumbling shame in a game three years ago.]

873
00:55:38,069 --> 00:55:42,609
[The day to feel that terror once again
has returned.]

874
00:55:42,610 --> 00:55:45,150
- How long do we have to sit there for?
- The combined time needs to be...

875
00:55:46,159 --> 00:55:51,237
[They must last for the total combined time
of two whole minutes to succeed the mission.]

876
00:55:51,238 --> 00:55:54,525
[But their feet must be off the ground.]

877
00:55:55,417 --> 00:55:58,663
But this will crumble... it's not crumbling.

878
00:55:59,813 --> 00:56:02,333
What are you doing?

879
00:56:02,334 --> 00:56:04,339
You really are something else.

880
00:56:04,340 --> 00:56:06,803
You should go first.

881
00:56:06,804 --> 00:56:09,354
We'll show you a demonstration.
This is how it needs to be done.

882
00:56:10,155 --> 00:56:12,297
He looks so comfortable doing it.

883
00:56:17,667 --> 00:56:20,621
If he makes it look so easy like that...

884
00:56:24,781 --> 00:56:27,395
You have to last for at least a minute
and 50 seconds on there.

885
00:56:29,687 --> 00:56:32,793
[His first contact with the shocking cone.]

886
00:56:32,794 --> 00:56:34,945
There's no room for it to go in.

887
00:56:34,946 --> 00:56:37,031
Where would it go in?

888
00:56:37,032 --> 00:56:40,091
[Where are you trying to stick it?]

889
00:56:44,739 --> 00:56:47,298
[Seung Soo takes his turn.]

890
00:56:47,299 --> 00:56:49,401
His foot is touching the ground.

891
00:56:53,477 --> 00:56:56,283
Can you shoot him from the side?

892
00:56:56,284 --> 00:56:58,973
Why do you have your hands at your sides?

893
00:56:59,249 --> 00:57:02,447
Why are you posing like that?
That's a cute pose.

894
00:57:02,482 --> 00:57:04,655
You have to endure through the pain.

895
00:57:04,656 --> 00:57:07,980
Yes, we can do this.
I think we can do this.

896
00:57:08,015 --> 00:57:10,305
Yes, we can do this.

897
00:57:11,851 --> 00:57:15,598
[No, I can't do it!]

898
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:17,651
What are you doing?

899
00:57:17,652 --> 00:57:19,461
His time is 26 seconds.

900
00:57:19,461 --> 00:57:21,687
There's no way I can do that.

901
00:57:21,688 --> 00:57:24,828
[Jae Suk must last for one minute and
34 seconds for them to succeed.]

902
00:57:24,829 --> 00:57:26,901
Watch from behind and make sure
that I don't start to bleed.

903
00:57:26,902 --> 00:57:29,969
If I start to bleed,
kick the cone out from under me, okay?

904
00:57:31,417 --> 00:57:36,263
[If something starts to dribble out,
then kick the cone away, not me.]

905
00:57:37,780 --> 00:57:40,432
- You need one minute and 34 seconds.
- Okay.

906
00:57:40,433 --> 00:57:42,574
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

907
00:57:44,515 --> 00:57:46,563
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

908
00:57:46,564 --> 00:57:49,023
I'm trying to massage out the pain.

909
00:57:49,024 --> 00:57:51,218
What are you doing over there?

910
00:57:53,080 --> 00:57:55,306
You think you're over there exercising?

911
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:03,723
[Jae Suk takes his turn.]

912
00:58:06,198 --> 00:58:10,724
[It's coming...]

913
00:58:14,044 --> 00:58:15,886
It's really getting up there.

914
00:58:18,918 --> 00:58:21,267
I think I should kick the cone out
from under you.

915
00:58:21,777 --> 00:58:24,753
[It's starting to dig deeper and deeper
into a place where it doesn't belong.]

916
00:58:36,128 --> 00:58:37,968
Massage it out.

917
00:58:41,756 --> 00:58:44,865
[Starting the cone therapy session.]

918
00:58:50,866 --> 00:58:52,530
I can't do that.

919
00:58:52,531 --> 00:58:58,190
- There's no way we can do that.
- Your combined time is, 56 seconds.

920
00:58:58,191 --> 00:59:00,864
[With a total combined time of 56 seconds,
they fail the mission.]

921
00:59:02,943 --> 00:59:05,284
[All they can manage to do is to laugh.]

922
00:59:05,285 --> 00:59:07,676
- Gary's really good at eating spicy foods.
- Really?

923
00:59:07,677 --> 00:59:11,894
[Gary and Sang Hwa are hoping for
number six with Gary's love for spicy foods.]

924
00:59:11,895 --> 00:59:15,173
I really love spicy foods.
I hope we get the spicy food game.

925
00:59:15,174 --> 00:59:17,774
- Number five.
- We haven't seen that one before.

926
00:59:17,775 --> 00:59:19,143
No one's gotten that one before,
so we don't know which one that is.

927
00:59:19,144 --> 00:59:20,776
Let's succeed with our first attempt.

928
00:59:20,777 --> 00:59:22,651
- 'Hold the position.'
- What's that?

929
00:59:23,117 --> 00:59:25,922
[Hold the position?]

930
00:59:25,923 --> 00:59:29,303
It's a position that used to be quite popular
on the internet for a while.

931
00:59:29,304 --> 00:59:32,435
It's a position that most couples
have been in at least once.

932
00:59:32,436 --> 00:59:35,437
- Couples?
- Here is your position.

933
00:59:35,998 --> 00:59:38,004
How do you expect us to do that?

934
00:59:38,300 --> 00:59:41,318
[Precisely this position.]

935
00:59:42,474 --> 00:59:46,374
[A position that everyone tried
and became famous throughout the world.]

936
00:59:47,026 --> 00:59:50,010
- I remember seeing that.
- How do you expect us to do that?

937
00:59:50,790 --> 00:59:52,781
That's athlete, Lee Sang Hwa, over there.

938
00:59:52,782 --> 00:59:54,635
That's Lee Sang Hwa.

939
00:59:54,636 --> 00:59:57,130
- Aren't you going to do the lifting, Gary?
- No, I'll get on top.

940
01:00:01,109 --> 01:00:02,313
See?
Did you see that?

941
01:00:02,314 --> 01:00:04,736
Gary's going to get on top?

942
01:00:04,737 --> 01:00:08,068
If Lee Sang Hwa holds him up,
then you must last for two minutes.

943
01:00:08,069 --> 01:00:09,946
But if it's Gary holding her up,
then it's for three minutes.

944
01:00:09,947 --> 01:00:12,902
- Can we try this too?
- No, you have to roll the number.

945
01:00:12,903 --> 01:00:14,356
That's what I meant.

946
01:00:16,449 --> 01:00:20,492
- Stop talking like that.
- In case they fail it.

947
01:00:23,088 --> 01:00:25,354
[Gary and Sang Hwa's attempt
to hold the position.]

948
01:00:25,355 --> 01:00:28,300
Ready?
Want me to go up now?

949
01:00:34,357 --> 01:00:38,402
No, wait.
Sorry, but I wasn't ready for it.

950
01:00:38,403 --> 01:00:42,232
- You'd better not fall.
- Okay.

951
01:00:45,648 --> 01:00:48,846
- Sang Hwa told him that he can't fall.
- Okay.

952
01:00:52,622 --> 01:00:54,368
Stand up!

953
01:01:10,483 --> 01:01:11,902
Gary.

954
01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:14,593
I really tried as hard as I could.

955
01:01:14,594 --> 01:01:16,708
I really did.
Sang Hwa, I'm so sorry.

956
01:01:16,709 --> 01:01:18,482
I can try it again.

957
01:01:18,483 --> 01:01:20,800
Sang Hwa's really angry right now.

958
01:01:30,108 --> 01:01:35,358
[2:10-
Plane Teams arrives at Gwangjoo Airport.]

959
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:40,704
[First to leave the starting point,
and the last ones to arrive in Gwangjoo.]

960
01:01:42,216 --> 01:01:46,608
[Go to Gwangjoo bus terminal.]

961
01:01:46,609 --> 01:01:49,001
Let's all go together.
It's really nice out here.

962
01:01:49,002 --> 01:01:51,692
Which one should we take?
Let's take this cab.

963
01:01:56,280 --> 01:01:59,958
[Great chemistry.
These four are very tightly knit.]

964
01:02:04,189 --> 01:02:07,568
[And over here...
no one will want these four.]

965
01:02:16,961 --> 01:02:20,416
[2:50- Gwangjoo bus terminal.]

966
01:02:20,417 --> 01:02:22,388
[Six again!]

967
01:02:25,411 --> 01:02:27,148
Hey!
Do you want to die!

968
01:02:28,377 --> 01:02:30,606
[Enthusiastic Kim apologizes again.]

969
01:02:30,607 --> 01:02:31,729
Roll it again.

970
01:02:31,730 --> 01:02:34,717
No more breaks.
If you get six again, you'll have to do it.

971
01:02:34,718 --> 01:02:36,962
I think Ji Hyo's going to start swearing
if she gets six again.

972
01:02:39,558 --> 01:02:41,699
[What will she roll this time?]

973
01:02:44,376 --> 01:02:48,294
[Number five- Couple position.]

974
01:02:48,295 --> 01:02:51,585
[After Seung Soo's recent proposal,
time has been changed from 3 to 2 minutes.]

975
01:02:55,783 --> 01:02:58,187
Look at how enthusiastic he is again!

976
01:02:58,188 --> 01:03:02,065
['Go-for-it' Enthusiastic Kim doesn't even
take any time out to think about it first.]

977
01:03:02,066 --> 01:03:04,471
One, two, three.

978
01:03:04,783 --> 01:03:06,613
[Goes for it with enthusiasm.]

979
01:03:08,479 --> 01:03:11,973
[Looking pretty steady.]

980
01:03:13,045 --> 01:03:14,783
He's shaking.

981
01:03:15,899 --> 01:03:17,252
Hey, Enthusiasm.

982
01:03:17,253 --> 01:03:19,369
- Enthusiastic Kim.
- Did you call me?

983
01:03:19,370 --> 01:03:22,981
- You're looking good.
- You can stop at any time now.

984
01:03:22,982 --> 01:03:27,013
- No, I'm going to last for two minutes.
- Be quiet and stop talking!

985
01:03:29,583 --> 01:03:33,077
[People are talking to him from the sides,
and up top, he's being told to shut up.]

986
01:03:35,332 --> 01:03:37,260
30 seconds.

987
01:03:37,261 --> 01:03:39,519
Two minutes.
We need to hold this for two minutes.

988
01:03:40,887 --> 01:03:43,044
- He's about to break.
- Enthusiastic Kim is about to lose it.

989
01:03:43,045 --> 01:03:46,853
No, he's about to break.
His knees are starting to shake.

990
01:03:47,547 --> 01:03:50,404
- Just a little bit longer.
- Ji Hyo's trying harder than he is.

991
01:03:51,587 --> 01:03:55,160
[Enthusiastic Kim is just hanging on
to Blank-Hangar?]

992
01:03:57,989 --> 01:04:00,470
- One minute and 30 seconds.
- Just 30 seconds more.

993
01:04:00,471 --> 01:04:03,106
He'll drop her at around the 47 second mark.

994
01:04:04,912 --> 01:04:07,204
Enthusiastic Kim will drop her
at around 1 minute 47 seconds.

995
01:04:07,205 --> 01:04:11,592
- Maybe even at 57 seconds.
- Stop talking to me!

996
01:04:11,593 --> 01:04:14,799
- You can do this!
- If you drop her then, you'll be a legend!

997
01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:17,102
- Now's the time!
- Now's the time to drop her!

998
01:04:17,484 --> 01:04:23,896
[Will it be for laughter...
or will it be for the win?]

999
01:04:24,544 --> 01:04:27,239
- Why did you suggest two minutes, Seung Soo?
- It's your fault, Seung Soo.

1000
01:04:27,240 --> 01:04:33,034
- Five, four, three, two, one...
- Drop her now!

1001
01:04:34,432 --> 01:04:38,732
[Mission success!]

1002
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:44,170
He started shaking from the moment
that he lifted me up.

1003
01:04:45,557 --> 01:04:49,914
You did great, Enthusiastic Kim!
I'm proud of you!

1004
01:04:50,980 --> 01:04:53,127
- You have to thank me.
- Thank you, Sir!

1005
01:04:56,540 --> 01:04:59,114
- Are you okay?
- I don't think I can use my arms anymore.

1006
01:05:00,322 --> 01:05:02,254
So it's our turn now, right?

1007
01:05:02,255 --> 01:05:03,833
Okay, here we go.

1008
01:05:04,962 --> 01:05:08,736
[Ji Hyo and Dong Jun are off to their final
destination after clearing their mission.]

1009
01:05:08,737 --> 01:05:14,335
[Final destination-
Songhori Beach in Haenam.]

1010
01:05:14,336 --> 01:05:17,939
[Must find their own way
to their final destination.]

1011
01:05:17,940 --> 01:05:22,034
[Huge advantage will be given to those teams
that arrives early at the destination.]

1012
01:05:22,411 --> 01:05:25,092
- We need a bus to Haenam.
- Haenam.

1013
01:05:26,998 --> 01:05:31,026
[Checking for bus times inside the terminal.]

1014
01:05:35,228 --> 01:05:37,971
Hello, do you have a bus
that's leaving for Haenam?

1015
01:05:37,972 --> 01:05:39,844
- Yes.
- What time does the bus leave?

1016
01:05:40,658 --> 01:05:45,430
[Current time- 2:48.
Next bus departs at 3:10.]

1017
01:05:45,431 --> 01:05:46,771
- What time is the next bus?
- The next one is at 3:10.

1018
01:05:46,772 --> 01:05:49,190
- Really? How much are the tickets?
- 11,100 won.

1019
01:05:49,191 --> 01:05:52,017
- How many of you are there?
- Two.

1020
01:05:52,018 --> 01:05:54,318
Your total is, 22,200 won.

1021
01:05:55,870 --> 01:05:58,553
We're really going to Haenam?

1022
01:06:00,053 --> 01:06:02,943
[The other teams must complete their mission
before they can leave for Haenam.]

1023
01:06:02,944 --> 01:06:06,258
[Jae Suk and Seung Soo are back at trying
their hand at the cone position game.]

1024
01:06:06,259 --> 01:06:07,703
Fighting, Seung Soo.

1025
01:06:10,395 --> 01:06:14,491
- He's better than I expected for him to be.
- Seung Soo's an enthusiast too.

1026
01:06:15,222 --> 01:06:17,891
I bet he'll last for about 15 seconds.

1027
01:06:18,863 --> 01:06:20,823
Seung Soo, are you okay?

1028
01:06:20,824 --> 01:06:22,934
Don't act like you're okay.

1029
01:06:24,647 --> 01:06:28,687
- This really isn't an easy task.
- One minute.

1030
01:06:35,323 --> 01:06:37,545
It's really sticking up there.

1031
01:06:37,546 --> 01:06:41,117
Seung Soo, are you okay?
It's really up there!

1032
01:06:41,118 --> 01:06:44,877
[That has to be pretty painful...]

1033
01:06:46,189 --> 01:06:49,472
[But Seung Soo's still
maintaining his position.]

1034
01:06:49,473 --> 01:06:52,183
Can he do the whole thing by himself?

1035
01:06:53,085 --> 01:06:59,707
[Then he really isn't just a total goofball?]

1036
01:06:59,708 --> 01:07:01,538
Why couldn't you have done this earlier?

1037
01:07:03,398 --> 01:07:07,261
[Is Seung Soo really going to complete
the full two minutes by himself like this?]

1038
01:07:07,262 --> 01:07:08,717
Success!

1039
01:07:09,839 --> 01:07:12,915
[Who knew that goofy Seung Soo
had this side to him?]

1040
01:07:16,111 --> 01:07:17,912
Massage...

1041
01:07:25,897 --> 01:07:27,587
I knew something was off!

1042
01:07:27,588 --> 01:07:29,685
He has something in there!

1043
01:07:29,686 --> 01:07:31,351
[Huh?]

1044
01:07:32,108 --> 01:07:34,991
[What's inside Seung Soo's pants?]

1045
01:07:43,187 --> 01:07:46,325
[A bottle of water!]

1046
01:07:48,257 --> 01:07:51,445
[He shoved a bottle of water
inside his pants!]

1047
01:07:51,446 --> 01:07:54,596
Seung Soo, seriously...
he really is no good!

1048
01:07:58,969 --> 01:08:02,383
[A shocking twist on par with
the ending of 'The Usual Suspects'!]

1049
01:08:03,917 --> 01:08:08,885
[While Jae Suk was talking to the producer
before starting the mission...]

1050
01:08:11,140 --> 01:08:14,516
[He shoves the bottle of water that he had
in his jacket pocket inside his pants.]

1051
01:08:16,229 --> 01:08:18,652
<i>This is taking too long.
Why don't you go first, Seung Soo?</i>

1052
01:08:24,073 --> 01:08:27,992
[Positioning the bottle of water
carefully in his pants...]

1053
01:08:27,993 --> 01:08:29,877
<i>Fighting, Seung Soo.</i>

1054
01:08:29,878 --> 01:08:30,925
[Yeah... this is the spot.]

1055
01:08:33,656 --> 01:08:39,614
[That's why he was able to remain
so calm and peaceful.]

1056
01:08:40,043 --> 01:08:42,248
Why would you point that out
to everyone!

1057
01:08:43,944 --> 01:08:48,020
[Water bottle scheme that no one
could've even fathomed happening!]

1058
01:08:52,756 --> 01:08:55,706
[Jong Kook and Min Jong arrives in
the midst of all this chaos.]

1059
01:08:56,765 --> 01:08:58,928
I can't believe him!

1060
01:09:01,614 --> 01:09:06,744
[Cone schemer, Ryu Seung Soo!]

1061
01:09:06,745 --> 01:09:09,053
Hi... it still hurts.

1062
01:09:09,054 --> 01:09:12,149
None of us would've known if it hadn't
been for Gary.

1063
01:09:12,150 --> 01:09:14,924
I was trying to help him massage his back
when I noticed something sticking out.

1064
01:09:14,925 --> 01:09:17,974
What were you thinking, Seung Soo?

1065
01:09:17,975 --> 01:09:19,519
[Cone scheme that will go down
in history of the show.]

1066
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:21,718
[Jong Kook and Min Jong take their turn.]

1067
01:09:21,719 --> 01:09:24,261
I really hope that you get number six.

1068
01:09:24,570 --> 01:09:28,342
[Everyone wants them to roll number six
because they know Kkuk can't handle spice.]

1069
01:09:28,343 --> 01:09:30,520
Number six!

1070
01:09:34,975 --> 01:09:36,994
- Why, what's number six?
- Jong Kook's in trouble now!

1071
01:09:38,336 --> 01:09:40,868
No drinking of water after
eating spicy food!

1072
01:09:42,656 --> 01:09:44,923
It's ddukbbokki,
which Jong Kook doesn't normally eat.

1073
01:09:44,924 --> 01:09:47,763
[And on top of everything else,
it's food that Jong Kook normally won't eat.]

1074
01:09:47,764 --> 01:09:50,099
- That is no joke.
- I really can't handle spicy food.

1075
01:09:50,100 --> 01:09:52,637
[Mr. Capable's Achilles' heel is spicy food.]

1076
01:09:52,638 --> 01:09:55,041
If you pass on this chance,
then the next team will get a chance.

1077
01:09:55,605 --> 01:09:57,508
Don't worry, I'll eat it all myself.

1078
01:09:58,154 --> 01:10:01,517
You have to eat the whole thing within
two minutes and whistle afterward.

1079
01:10:01,518 --> 01:10:04,024
Then you can't drink any water
until your two minutes are up.

1080
01:10:04,025 --> 01:10:06,001
- I don't have to whistle for a minute?
- No, you don't.

1081
01:10:07,610 --> 01:10:10,542
[You can't be serious...]

1082
01:10:10,543 --> 01:10:12,736
Seriously, what's wrong with that guy?

1083
01:10:13,644 --> 01:10:15,409
Knock it off.

1084
01:10:18,561 --> 01:10:21,708
- Okay, I'll start the clock.
- Min Jong won't be able to do it.

1085
01:10:21,709 --> 01:10:23,861
- Set, go!
- How spicy could it be?

1086
01:10:23,862 --> 01:10:27,066
- It's okay in the beginning.
- It's okay when you're eating it.

1087
01:10:27,067 --> 01:10:32,376
Five, four, three, two, one.
It'll hit at any moment.

1088
01:10:34,592 --> 01:10:36,942
[There it is.]

1089
01:10:36,943 --> 01:10:38,758
Min Jong says it's too hard to chew.

1090
01:10:38,759 --> 01:10:42,182
- Why do I want to try a bite of that?
- You can't eat spicy food?

1091
01:10:42,183 --> 01:10:44,909
- I'm hungry.
- Jong Kook is feeling it now.

1092
01:10:47,321 --> 01:10:50,999
[Kkuk, who can't handle any spice
is starting to hiccup from the hotness of it.]

1093
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:54,340
- Spicy food makes you hiccup.
- Jong Kook never eats spicy food.

1094
01:10:54,341 --> 01:10:56,967
- Look at Min Jong.
- You don't find that spicy?

1095
01:10:56,968 --> 01:10:58,715
[Min Jong is continuing to eat
without any hesitation.]

1096
01:10:58,716 --> 01:11:01,621
- Isn't that spicy?
- It's too hard to chew.

1097
01:11:02,164 --> 01:11:04,155
[Spice isn't the problem,
but it's too hard to chew?]

1098
01:11:06,982 --> 01:11:09,330
- You can't drink that.
- I almost had him.

1099
01:11:11,151 --> 01:11:13,361
[One minute]

1100
01:11:13,958 --> 01:11:16,975
- Have you always liked spicy food?
- How can you eat such spicy food like that?

1101
01:11:21,070 --> 01:11:24,822
Min Jong...
your face is starting to get really red.

1102
01:11:24,823 --> 01:11:26,853
Did you see the bottle of water
in my hand?

1103
01:11:30,063 --> 01:11:32,211
This is too hard to chew.

1104
01:11:32,212 --> 01:11:34,476
- Are you sure it's not the spice?
- It's not the spice you're complaining about?

1105
01:11:34,477 --> 01:11:36,190
[We'll say it's too tough to chew.]

1106
01:11:38,585 --> 01:11:40,468
You have to eat this scallion.

1107
01:11:40,469 --> 01:11:43,487
- You have to eat that.
- You have to eat that scallion.

1108
01:11:43,488 --> 01:11:45,363
[Bratty Big-nose is making sure that every
last bite gets eaten.]

1109
01:11:48,391 --> 01:11:50,238
[Kkuk succeeds at whistling.]

1110
01:11:50,390 --> 01:11:52,439
- It's your turn to whistle now.
- You do it.

1111
01:11:52,440 --> 01:11:54,147
I just did!

1112
01:11:55,087 --> 01:11:58,257
- I just did!
- Five, four, three, two...

1113
01:11:58,258 --> 01:12:01,705
[Min Jong also succeeds at whistling.]

1114
01:12:01,706 --> 01:12:05,001
[They must now endure the next minute
without drinking any water.]

1115
01:12:10,668 --> 01:12:13,187
Why are you shadowboxing
all of a sudden?

1116
01:12:16,978 --> 01:12:18,773
Here, have a drink of water.

1117
01:12:18,774 --> 01:12:20,807
[Everyone's trying to ruin their chance
at succeeding the mission.]

1118
01:12:20,808 --> 01:12:23,598
[Min Jong doesn't even have it in him
to make any replies.]

1119
01:12:26,531 --> 01:12:28,699
Isn't it cheating if they blow their nose?

1120
01:12:29,214 --> 01:12:32,328
[Blowing their nose is cheating?]

1121
01:12:32,329 --> 01:12:35,537
- No, you can't blow your nose.
- Yes, I can!

1122
01:12:35,572 --> 01:12:37,812
That's cheating.
You can't do anything.

1123
01:12:37,813 --> 01:12:40,874
- You can't do anything right now.
- Look at his runny nose!

1124
01:12:41,814 --> 01:12:43,986
That's really spicy.

1125
01:12:45,489 --> 01:12:47,152
[Jong Kook and Min Jong succeed
the spicy ddukbbokki game.]

1126
01:12:47,153 --> 01:12:49,545
[Min Jong blows his nose the moment
the mission is over.]

1127
01:12:50,106 --> 01:12:52,912
[Even in the midst of his agony,
Kkuk takes care of Min Jong first.]

1128
01:12:52,913 --> 01:12:54,765
Can I have some water?

1129
01:12:54,866 --> 01:12:58,629
[Big-nose can't get any brattier
even if he tried.]

1130
01:12:58,630 --> 01:13:00,331
Let him drink his water.

1131
01:13:03,228 --> 01:13:08,132
[Ji Hyo and Dong Jun's awaited bus
finally arrives at the terminal.]

1132
01:13:12,385 --> 01:13:13,923
Let's go.

1133
01:13:13,924 --> 01:13:16,401
[3:10- Ji Hyo and Dong Jun board the bus.]

1134
01:13:17,154 --> 01:13:19,298
We'll see you in Haenam.

1135

- No, I just need somewhere to sleep.

1296
01:24:54,657 --> 01:24:58,717
How can others not be better than this?
They have to be better than this.

1297
01:25:06,353 --> 01:25:08,370
I guess I'm not very lucky
this year either.

1298
01:25:11,816 --> 01:25:14,253
Wow, this is awesome!
Awesome!

1299
01:25:14,254 --> 01:25:16,513
[Tent for the second place winners stands up
to the standards of any luxury hotel.]

1300
01:25:18,804 --> 01:25:23,096
[Beds and a wood burning stove?]

1301
01:25:23,772 --> 01:25:26,584
- Wow, it's really nice in here.
- This tent is like a house!

1302
01:25:27,480 --> 01:25:30,587
[Through Dong Jun's graciousness,
the three women will stay in this tent.]

1303
01:25:30,588 --> 01:25:32,243
It's almost too hot in here.

1304
01:25:32,766 --> 01:25:35,755
This is so nice!

1305
01:25:40,021 --> 01:25:41,705
What do you think?

1306
01:25:43,970 --> 01:25:46,159
I can't sleep without music.

1307
01:25:48,608 --> 01:25:50,909
What more could I want than this!

1308
01:25:53,339 --> 01:25:57,952
- Wow, this is kind of romantic!
- Sentimental camping.

1309
01:25:58,635 --> 01:26:01,645
This is romantic.

1310
01:26:09,774 --> 01:26:11,371
This is so nice.

1311
01:26:12,789 --> 01:26:14,740
What is there to life?

1312
01:26:15,650 --> 01:26:18,190
Gary, what is there to love?

1313
01:26:18,191 --> 01:26:21,325
When it comes to love...

1314
01:26:21,326 --> 01:26:23,929
there are no answers.

1315
01:26:25,858 --> 01:26:30,268
Even though I've loved for over 20 years...
I have yet to find the answers.

1316
01:26:31,525 --> 01:26:35,039
When it comes to love...
love is the answer.

1317
01:26:39,304 --> 01:26:41,042
Ji Hyo!

1318
01:26:41,043 --> 01:26:42,893
[Ji Hyo hears the music playing,
and stops by for a visit.]

1319
01:26:42,894 --> 01:26:46,521
- Ji Hyo.
- Wow... it's so cozy in here too.

1320
01:26:46,522 --> 01:26:49,337
Your two men are sleeping in here
together.

1321
01:26:49,338 --> 01:26:51,693
[Ji Hyo's two men?]

1322
01:26:53,450 --> 01:26:55,932
You are such a greedy woman.

1323
01:26:55,933 --> 01:26:58,470
- What's the name of this song, Gary?
- This song?

1324
01:26:59,093 --> 01:27:00,854
A special song just for you.

1325
01:27:02,960 --> 01:27:08,052
[On this rainy evening...
at the end of the earth...]

1326
01:27:08,053 --> 01:27:11,432
[A special song, just for you.]

1327
01:27:11,433 --> 01:27:13,464
This is so nice!

1328
01:27:13,465 --> 01:27:18,293
- Let's go camping every day!
- Don't say things like that, Ji Hyo.

1329
01:27:19,624 --> 01:27:21,498
I'm not ready to go to bed yet.

1330
01:27:23,692 --> 01:27:27,244
[Even the fifth place winner's tent
is quite warm and cozy.]

1331
01:27:28,222 --> 01:27:30,682
It feels like such a waste to
just go to sleep right now.

1332
01:27:30,683 --> 01:27:34,026
[Two more people right here
who aren't quite ready for bed yet.]

1333
01:27:36,086 --> 01:27:39,569
[A shot of water to help ease
away the pain of their exhaustion.]

1334
01:27:42,963 --> 01:27:47,250
[A shot of water...
and a tidbit of love as a chaser.]

1335
01:27:54,423 --> 01:28:00,078
[They really... play so well together.]

1336
01:28:00,079 --> 01:28:01,659
Here's a tidbit of memories.

1337
01:28:05,006 --> 01:28:09,109
[Their water drinking continues
for a while longer...]

1338
01:28:12,168 --> 01:28:16,373
[With the memories of their day together
put to bed...]

1339
01:28:16,374 --> 01:28:19,273
[They all drift off to dreamland
with their partners.]

1340
01:28:21,230 --> 01:28:24,392
[With the anticipation of
more memories to come.]

1341
01:28:25,744 --> 01:28:26,765
<i>[A mafia is hidden amongst them.]</i>

1342
01:28:26,766 --> 01:28:29,591
<i>There's a mafia member hidden
amongst you.</i>

1343
01:28:30,611 --> 01:28:34,171
<i>[We are no longer friends.
We must suspect everyone!]</i>

1344
01:28:34,172 --> 01:28:35,745
<i>[The seeker, and the hider.]</i>

1345
01:28:35,746 --> 01:28:39,141
<i>[Catch the mafia!]</i>

1346
01:28:42,139 --> 01:28:48,185
<i>[A bloody battle of deceit and lies.]</i>

1347
01:28:51,327 --> 01:28:54,144
<i>[A shocking turn of events!]</i>

1348
01:28:55,161 --> 01:28:57,679
<i>[Who will be the last one left standing?]</i>

1349
01:28:57,680 --> 01:28:59,125
<i>[Next week's Running Man-
Civilians vs Mafia.]</i>

1350
