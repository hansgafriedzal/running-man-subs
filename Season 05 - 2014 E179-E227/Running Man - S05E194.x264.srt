[14 people who are not connected
to each other...]

00:00:23,949 --> 00:00:27,846
[When they arrived at the
southernmost point of Korea...]

7
00:00:27,846 --> 00:00:30,688
[This case began.]

8
00:00:41,405 --> 00:00:45,047
While you are eating...
[The morning after they got together]

9
00:00:45,047 --> 00:00:48,596
We will meet with each of you in private
to give your mission.

10
00:00:48,986 --> 00:00:54,665
Each one of you will get called during this
meal to receive your mission.

11
00:00:54,665 --> 00:00:59,525
[No one had any idea how this humble beginning
would lead up to a tremendous ending.]

12
00:01:00,467 --> 00:01:07,217
[Today, you're either a civilian or
part of the Mafia.]

13
00:01:07,217 --> 00:01:10,621
Today, you are either...

14
00:01:10,621 --> 00:01:13,570
Mafia! / Civilian!
[Mission Notification Complete]

15
00:01:17,174 --> 00:01:18,711
<i>The end.</i>

16
00:01:22,287 --> 00:01:25,588
Staying calm, without panic.

17
00:01:25,588 --> 00:01:27,625
The end!

18
00:01:29,105 --> 00:01:30,560
[The game begins!]

19
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:35,686
<i>Today's race is the Mafia game.
Mafia vs. Civilian!</i>

20
00:01:36,375 --> 00:01:38,267
<i>Your goal is to identify and capture
the members of the Mafia.</i>

21
00:01:38,267 --> 00:01:42,925
<i>After every mission, you shall decide on
the two most suspicious characters...</i>

22
00:01:42,925 --> 00:01:45,597
<i>and remove them from the game.</i>

23
00:01:46,972 --> 00:01:51,531
<i>If any member of the Mafia survives until
the end, it's a victory for the Mafia.</i>

24
00:01:59,694 --> 00:02:02,029
[Suspect Number One]
[Ryu Seung Soo]

25
00:02:02,029 --> 00:02:05,084
[The main character of the
legendary water bottle fraud incident]

26
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,520
[Gwangju Bus Terminal,
several weeks ago.]

27
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:11,888
It went in pretty deep!
Are you okay?

28
00:02:11,888 --> 00:02:14,809
It went in this much!

29
00:02:14,809 --> 00:02:16,285
He's fine!

30
00:02:16,285 --> 00:02:18,898
- One minute and 30 seconds.
- Excellent!

31
00:02:18,898 --> 00:02:21,354
Is he going to do the whole thing
by himself?

32
00:02:22,179 --> 00:02:24,462
Good heavens!
You should've performed this well before!

33
00:02:25,333 --> 00:02:29,192
Three, two, one...
Success!

34
00:02:29,192 --> 00:02:31,469
[Seung Soo lasted two minutes
on his own.]

35
00:02:31,469 --> 00:02:34,668
I think he needs to get his
internal organs checked out!

36
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:40,042
[As everyone was impressed by
his perseverance...]

37
00:02:45,332 --> 00:02:47,417
I knew something was weird!

38
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:48,964
He has this!

39
00:02:50,227 --> 00:02:54,058
[Everyone was astonished by
the secret of his butt.]

40
00:02:57,766 --> 00:02:59,352
This guy...

41
00:03:00,821 --> 00:03:04,743
[The secret was...]

42
00:03:04,743 --> 00:03:07,782
[a water bottle.]

43
00:03:11,371 --> 00:03:15,041
[The very first incident of water bottle fraud
in the history of Running Man.]

44
00:03:16,084 --> 00:03:17,718
<i>No one had any idea!</i>

45
00:03:20,231 --> 00:03:22,502
[Five minutes before the game]

46
00:03:22,502 --> 00:03:28,746
[Meticulous planning!]

47
00:03:28,746 --> 00:03:32,372
[Bold execution!]

48
00:03:32,372 --> 00:03:34,544
I don't think this guy can do it!

49
00:03:36,102 --> 00:03:38,949
Fighting!
[Completed by his perfect acting!]

50
00:03:38,949 --> 00:03:43,712
[Mr. Ryu the Bluff,
the perfect candidate!]

51
00:03:43,712 --> 00:03:49,312
<i>You have 10 minutes to discuss and
pick the two most suspicious characters.</i>

52
00:03:51,383 --> 00:03:54,105
[He is the perfect suspect!]

53
00:03:54,105 --> 00:03:56,661
If you give it another thought,
you'll know that I'm not in the Mafia.

54
00:03:56,661 --> 00:04:00,655
- Why?
- Your natural first choice would be me.

55
00:04:00,655 --> 00:04:05,343
- That's not it!
- It's because of your attitude.

56
00:04:05,343 --> 00:04:07,618
- How would you deal with this later?
- What?

57
00:04:07,618 --> 00:04:09,029
What if I was a civilian all along?

58
00:04:09,029 --> 00:04:11,476
We'll say sorry and call it a day.

59
00:04:12,841 --> 00:04:15,231
[In a jungle of doubts,
you can't trust anyone.]

60
00:04:15,231 --> 00:04:17,830
Betrayal is second nature to
these people.

61
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:20,420
They aren't the kind of people
who would feel bad about that!

62
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:24,133
- But the producer...
- Just stop!

63
00:04:24,133 --> 00:04:27,358
Just stop because anything you say
will impact you negatively!

64
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,312
[Suspect Number Two]
[Yoo Jae Suk]

65
00:04:32,312 --> 00:04:34,595
<i>I choose Ryu Seung Soo.</i>

66
00:04:34,595 --> 00:04:36,158
[He cornered Seung Soo from
the very beginning.]

67
00:04:36,158 --> 00:04:41,479
[Ryu Seung Soo!]

68
00:04:41,479 --> 00:04:43,896
I think we have one guy for sure.
Ryu Seung Soo!

69
00:04:43,896 --> 00:04:46,897
We already have one of the
Mafia members!

70
00:04:47,605 --> 00:04:51,037
That would be Ryu Seung Soo!

71
00:04:51,037 --> 00:04:52,901
I think it might be Jae Suk.

72
00:04:53,677 --> 00:04:55,928
- Jae Suk is...
- Hey, I'm a real civilian!

73
00:04:55,928 --> 00:04:59,818
- I think he's manipulating Seung Soo...
- I'm a real civilian!

74
00:04:59,818 --> 00:05:01,945
You have to be careful of the people
who corner others.

75
00:05:01,945 --> 00:05:04,492
I think it might be Jae Suk.

76
00:05:04,492 --> 00:05:08,939
[If you think about it, this man...]

77
00:05:08,939 --> 00:05:12,336
[This man is the legendary spy,
Yoo-ames Bond.]

78
00:05:14,014 --> 00:05:18,151
[He successfully deceived the quick-witted
members of Running Man so many times before.]

79
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:20,325
- How can you do this to me?
- Goodbye!

80
00:05:20,325 --> 00:05:23,785
[Will the Master of Psychological Warfare
strike again today?]

81
00:05:25,429 --> 00:05:27,697
- Ms. Lee Sang Hwa.
- That's good!

82
00:05:27,697 --> 00:05:29,575
She must be a member of the
Mafia in my opinion.

83
00:05:29,575 --> 00:05:32,411
I think we might be half civilian,
half Mafia today.

84
00:05:32,464 --> 00:05:35,084
I try my best in everything I do.

85
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:41,428
Mafia! Mafia!

86
00:05:43,983 --> 00:05:47,801
[The Empress of Ice Skating,
Lee Sang Hwa!]

87
00:05:48,885 --> 00:05:52,657
[The best skater in the world
who doesn't know defeat!]

88
00:05:53,509 --> 00:05:57,165
[A cold closer who never loses her
temper in any situation!]

89
00:05:59,278 --> 00:06:03,353
[Running Man was no exception to
the competitive spirit of the Empress.]

90
00:06:04,529 --> 00:06:08,266
You shall never fall!
Never!

91
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,038
[During the crab mission of which the
prize was to be exempt from the selection...]

92
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:16,021
[She was especially enthusiastic.]

93
00:06:16,917 --> 00:06:21,030
[Equipped with cold logic and
burning passion...]

94
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:24,757
[She is impossible to read.]

95
00:06:24,757 --> 00:06:26,656
It must be Sang Hwa!

96
00:06:26,656 --> 00:06:30,720
I think there would be at least one Mafia
among us women.

97
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,072
How does that mean that it's me?

98
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:35,993
[Her strong passion only fuels
people's doubts.]

99
00:06:35,993 --> 00:06:38,725
[Suspect Number Three]
[Lee Sang Hwa]

100
00:06:40,501 --> 00:06:43,190
I think Sang Hwa is a member of
the Mafia.

101
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:45,984
I think it's you, Ji Hyo.

102
00:06:45,984 --> 00:06:49,169
You're cornering me because
you're in the Mafia yourself.

103
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:54,215
Ji Hyo just nodded!

104
00:06:54,215 --> 00:06:58,633
[Did she just reveal herself half-consciously?]

105
00:06:58,633 --> 00:07:01,315
[Well, if we think about it...]

106
00:07:01,315 --> 00:07:04,177
[Lying isn't her strong suit.]

107
00:07:06,053 --> 00:07:08,233
<i>Mission Number Six.
Please eat this spicy dish.</i>

108
00:07:08,233 --> 00:07:15,902
- It came! It came!
- It came early for Ji Hyo.

109
00:07:15,902 --> 00:07:18,438
Here, drink some water, Ji Hyo.

110
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:24,709
What is she doing?
Look at her throwing tantrums!

111
00:07:25,495 --> 00:07:26,877
[When she got the same mission again...]

112
00:07:26,877 --> 00:07:28,973
<i>Fire!</i>

113
00:07:28,973 --> 00:07:30,891
[She kicked it away!]

114
00:07:32,361 --> 00:07:36,092
[She often reveals her thoughts
involuntarily...]

115
00:07:36,092 --> 00:07:39,729
[Has she done it again?]

116
00:07:40,526 --> 00:07:43,239
[Suspect Number Four]
[Song Ji Hyo]

117
00:07:44,967 --> 00:07:48,769
People are always suspicious of the quiet ones!
[And last but not least, someone we can't forget.]

118
00:07:48,769 --> 00:07:52,200
I think it's you, Kwang Soo!
[The Icon of Betrayal, Lee Kwang Soo!]

119
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:54,432
Are the members of the Mafia
aware of each other?

120
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:57,622
- You probably know the best.
- Yes, you probably know!

121
00:07:57,942 --> 00:07:59,942
This is driving me crazy!
It's suffocating!

122
00:08:06,423 --> 00:08:10,094
[And this man...]

123
00:08:11,513 --> 00:08:13,834
[He called out on Ha Ha with
gravitas...]

124
00:08:13,834 --> 00:08:16,466
You are the members of the Mafia!

125
00:08:16,466 --> 00:08:19,608
[He managed to put Ha Ha on
the final trial.]

126
00:08:19,608 --> 00:08:24,026
Ha Ha, please stand up and turn around.

127
00:08:29,427 --> 00:08:32,984
[Civilian]
[He was a civilian!]

128
00:08:36,373 --> 00:08:38,186
[But...]

129
00:08:38,186 --> 00:08:43,427
[Is he smiling at the removal
of a civilian?]

130
00:08:45,635 --> 00:08:47,929
You are...

131
00:08:47,929 --> 00:08:52,056
a member of the Mafia today.

132
00:08:52,056 --> 00:08:54,438
[Kim Min Jong, the Second Mafia!]

133
00:08:54,438 --> 00:08:59,183
<i>You'll be exempt from the selection
if you manage to place in this mission.</i>

134
00:09:01,814 --> 00:09:03,796
I just caught three!

135
00:09:04,093 --> 00:09:09,739
[He placed first after destroying
the opponents in the Crab Race!]

136
00:09:09,739 --> 00:09:12,455
- I guess you're safe this time.
- I assume so.

137
00:09:12,805 --> 00:09:15,665
- Can we get out of here?
- Okay, fine.

138
00:09:15,665 --> 00:09:19,358
Now I must act like I get nauseous
until the end!

139
00:09:19,358 --> 00:09:24,011
Look at Min Jong.
He's knocked out!

140
00:09:24,011 --> 00:09:26,458
Does he usually get nauseous
that easily?

141
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:29,446
Are you okay, Min Jong?

142
00:09:30,529 --> 00:09:33,446
[Perfect acting based on his
26 years of experience.]

143
00:09:34,398 --> 00:09:37,769
I seriously thought Min Jong
might be a Mafia...

144
00:09:37,769 --> 00:09:41,851
- I don't think he's it.
- He didn't really want to win the first place.

145
00:09:41,851 --> 00:09:44,112
He didn't want to fish from the
very beginning.

146
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:48,549
[Can he continue his success
until the end?]

147
00:09:52,988 --> 00:09:54,999
[Mafia vs. Civilians]

148
00:09:55,871 --> 00:09:58,533
We have one minute.

149
00:09:59,195 --> 00:10:03,831
Before this mission,
we all thought Dong Joon might be it.

150
00:10:03,831 --> 00:10:06,125
It's not me, I promise!

151
00:10:07,409 --> 00:10:11,821
<i>So we don't have an unanimous consent,
right? Then we will vote individually.</i>

152
00:10:12,082 --> 00:10:13,744
- Who thinks it's Sang Hwa?
- Really?

153
00:10:15,123 --> 00:10:18,106
- Who? Sang Hwa?
[Three votes for Sang Hwa]

154
00:10:18,106 --> 00:10:19,601
Next, for Dong Joon!

155
00:10:19,601 --> 00:10:24,165
You'll regret this!
[Four votes for Dong Joon]

156
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:26,547
Next, for Jae Suk!

157
00:10:26,547 --> 00:10:28,417
[Four votes for Jae Suk]

158
00:10:28,417 --> 00:10:30,006
I'm really a civilian!

159
00:10:30,006 --> 00:10:31,245
<i>For Ryu Seung Soo...</i>

160
00:10:31,345 --> 00:10:34,211
- The Mafia is manipulating the votes!
[One vote for Seung Soo]

161
00:10:34,211 --> 00:10:36,349
He's like a weed that won't die!

162
00:10:36,349 --> 00:10:38,778
<i>- I'm really not it.
- I'm not it either!</i>

163
00:10:39,043 --> 00:10:41,710
<i>Who has four votes?</i>

164
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:46,460
[Jae Suk and Dong Joon are picked
after the second mission.]

165
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:48,911
<i>Is anyone changing their mind?
If not...</i>

166
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:54,953
[Excellent! My plan worked!]

167
00:10:55,576 --> 00:10:59,180
Dong Joon is the member of the Mafia!

168
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:02,453
<i>You really made a mistake with me!</i>

169
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:05,532
<i>Well, let's see first!</i>

170
00:11:06,814 --> 00:11:12,053
[Is he really a member of the Mafia?]

171
00:11:12,851 --> 00:11:16,293
[Dong Joon was a civilian!]

172
00:11:16,293 --> 00:11:18,373
I said I'm not it!
I never lie!

173
00:11:18,373 --> 00:11:21,044
You should've been more assertive!

174
00:11:21,044 --> 00:11:24,464
I didn't think he would be it!

175
00:11:24,464 --> 00:11:25,179
Just watch and learn.

176
00:11:25,179 --> 00:11:28,327
The Mafia is among the people
who voted for me and Dong Joon.

177
00:11:28,327 --> 00:11:30,167
Didn't Dong Joon vote for Jae Suk?

178
00:11:30,167 --> 00:11:33,081
I voted for Dong Joon...

179
00:11:33,081 --> 00:11:37,007
- Dong Joon voted for you too!
[Do we have a new couple?]

180
00:11:37,506 --> 00:11:38,911
<i>One of them must be it!</i>

181
00:11:38,911 --> 00:11:42,392
Jae Suk is the member of the Mafia!

182
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:46,870
<i>It must be Jae Suk.
He's a Mafia.</i>

183
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:49,308
<i>Dong Joon, it wasn't me!</i>

184
00:11:49,483 --> 00:11:52,020
- I think he might be it.
- He must be!

185
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:54,667
- Also Gary!
- I'm really not it!

186
00:11:56,516 --> 00:11:58,387
<i>One, two, three!</i>

187
00:11:59,018 --> 00:12:05,493
[Is Jae Suk, who was usually chatty today,
a member of the Mafia?]

188
00:12:07,865 --> 00:12:10,811
I will now give you your identity.

189
00:12:10,918 --> 00:12:16,258
You are...

190
00:12:22,855 --> 00:12:29,453
[He was also a civilian!]

191
00:12:31,916 --> 00:12:34,658
- See? I told you!
- Was he really a civilian?

192
00:12:34,658 --> 00:12:38,444
Look, the civilians must win!

193
00:12:40,661 --> 00:12:42,696
No!

194
00:12:42,986 --> 00:12:46,299
Take a good look at these
three people!

195
00:12:46,661 --> 00:12:49,945
You must remember these three,
along with Gary!

196
00:12:49,945 --> 00:12:52,367
[It's a lucky removal for Min Jong.]

197
00:12:55,132 --> 00:12:57,803
- Can it be you, Jung Nan?
- Hey!

198
00:12:57,803 --> 00:13:02,691
I said it's Sang Hwa!
[You can't trust anyone now!]

199
00:13:04,187 --> 00:13:05,998
<i>Be careful of Jong Kook!</i>

200
00:13:05,998 --> 00:13:08,399
You can rip my tag if you're doubtful.
I don't care.

201
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:11,602
Gentlemen, please pick up the fish
and go help prepare the meal.

202
00:13:11,602 --> 00:13:12,706
Please don't forget to bring
the chairs too.

203
00:13:12,706 --> 00:13:15,252
I didn't do anything productive today.

204
00:13:15,252 --> 00:13:17,488
<i>Why did people
become suspicious of me?</i>

205
00:13:17,816 --> 00:13:20,358
[Then who are my fellow members
of the Mafia?]

206
00:13:20,887 --> 00:13:23,236
- See you later, then.
[Two innocent civilians are removed.]

207
00:13:23,236 --> 00:13:25,451
- I'm sorry, Dong Joon!
- It's fine.

208
00:13:26,616 --> 00:13:28,377
[Bitterness...]

209
00:13:28,876 --> 00:13:31,611
- How could this happen?
- I'm sorry, Dong Joon.

210
00:13:31,611 --> 00:13:34,260
I'm also sorry for voting for you.

211
00:13:34,852 --> 00:13:39,649
[Two civilians, Kim Dong Joon and Yoo Jae Suk
have been removed.]

212
00:13:39,649 --> 00:13:43,749
<i>Now, we have two more missions left.</i>

213
00:13:43,749 --> 00:13:49,312
<i>And you have four chances to
remove the Mafia members.</i>

214
00:13:50,707 --> 00:13:53,404
<i>You don't know how many members of
the Mafia we have, right?</i>

215
00:13:53,404 --> 00:13:59,269
<i>I'll tell you how many members of
the Mafia are still in the game.</i>

216
00:13:59,269 --> 00:14:01,337
<i>This will make our lives easier!</i>

217
00:14:01,337 --> 00:14:06,257
<i>Currently, the number of
surviving members of the Mafia is...</i>

218
00:14:06,257 --> 00:14:10,645
<i>three.</i>

219
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:17,516
<i>If any member of the Mafia survives
until the end, the victory goes to the Mafia.</i>

220
00:14:17,516 --> 00:14:19,124
<i>Please make your way to our
next mission.</i>

221
00:14:19,124 --> 00:14:20,943
We can do this!

222
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:24,059
I'm sorry, but Seung Soo is 100% Mafia!

223
00:14:24,059 --> 00:14:27,853
[Will the civilians be able to remove
the Mafia?]

224
00:14:35,063 --> 00:14:39,178
[Three Mafia Members vs. Seven Civilians]

225
00:14:39,842 --> 00:14:42,292
Where are these latecomers?

226
00:14:42,292 --> 00:14:44,572
I know they've been removed!
Where are they?

227
00:14:45,441 --> 00:14:49,230
My fellow Mafia members
should've had more discretion.

228
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:52,094
But everyone was after their
own survival!

229
00:14:52,094 --> 00:14:56,468
How can they win without an ace like me?

230
00:14:57,067 --> 00:15:00,752
You are...
not an ace!

231
00:15:01,793 --> 00:15:05,262
This is called the Gargamel Curry.

232
00:15:05,262 --> 00:15:08,807
We charge 25,000 Won per plate.

233
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:12,209
We put everything that's good for
your body into this.

234
00:15:12,209 --> 00:15:14,723
- Are carrots being cooked?
- Yes, sir.

235
00:15:16,759 --> 00:15:21,200
<i>Why are you working so hard?
The latecomers will do all the work.</i>

236
00:15:22,843 --> 00:15:25,134
Are you sure this is how to cook it?

237
00:15:25,134 --> 00:15:31,607
This is to remove the bad smell of
meat and fish.

238
00:15:32,421 --> 00:15:35,215
We have already exchanged
our numbers and everything.

239
00:15:35,215 --> 00:15:37,720
He really is different from Jung Woo Sung!

240
00:15:39,881 --> 00:15:43,713
I really like you more!

241
00:15:43,713 --> 00:15:47,376
- Why do I feel like I'm getting back-stabbed?
- Nonsense!

242
00:15:47,376 --> 00:15:51,201
You're the perfect match for me!

243
00:15:53,115 --> 00:15:55,929
Hey, after seeing you up close...

244
00:15:55,929 --> 00:15:58,399
I think you look like that guy from that movie.
Slumdog... Something.

245
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:00,157
- Do you know what you're talking about?
- Millionaire!

246
00:16:00,157 --> 00:16:02,438
You look like that guy from
Slumdog Millionaire!

247
00:16:02,856 --> 00:16:05,921
Can I call you Hassan from now on?

248
00:16:05,921 --> 00:16:10,096
Brother Hassan!
I like it!

249
00:16:10,434 --> 00:16:11,750
Hold still, Hassan.

250
00:16:14,975 --> 00:16:19,674
This is usually when people back out.
But he's still going!

251
00:16:19,674 --> 00:16:22,001
This is warm.

252
00:16:22,001 --> 00:16:24,532
[Brother Hassan is extremely positive.]

253
00:16:24,532 --> 00:16:26,465
You look like a chef.

254

- From now on...
- That's a good look for you!

255
00:16:30,565 --> 00:16:32,859
We are cooking the Indian curry.

256
00:16:33,816 --> 00:16:35,338
When did you come to Korea?

257
00:16:35,931 --> 00:16:39,883
I came to Korea 15 years ago.

258
00:16:39,883 --> 00:16:44,200
I named myself Man Suk
so I can be rich!

259
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:49,276
He's really trying hard!

260
00:16:52,419 --> 00:16:55,149
[The Gargamel Curry is also boiling!]

261
00:16:56,510 --> 00:17:00,733
[The other members are
heading to their next mission.]

262
00:17:04,974 --> 00:17:08,967
Seung Soo has given up.
He's sleeping.

263
00:17:08,967 --> 00:17:11,416
He has given up on everything.

264
00:17:11,416 --> 00:17:13,840
He looks too comfortable as a
member of the Mafia.

265
00:17:15,281 --> 00:17:18,301
- You look very tired.
- Yes, I'm so tired.

266
00:17:18,301 --> 00:17:23,917
I feel like I'm really a member of the Mafia
because people keep telling me that!

267
00:17:23,917 --> 00:17:25,907
[Confusion in his identity]

268
00:17:29,865 --> 00:17:33,513
[Or is this his highly calculated acting?]

269
00:17:33,513 --> 00:17:36,721
<i>Have we decided that Min Jong
isn't part of the Mafia?</i>

270
00:17:36,721 --> 00:17:39,953
<i>I don't think he is.</i>

271
00:17:39,953 --> 00:17:44,341
[People shouldn't focus on me...]

272
00:17:44,999 --> 00:17:48,958
I looked at her while she was fishing.
She was especially focused!

273
00:17:48,958 --> 00:17:53,280
- I just wanted to try it!
- I don't think that's it!

274
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:59,016
I think she was trying too hard.

275
00:17:59,016 --> 00:18:02,952
I just want to take a break.
Seriously.

276
00:18:07,944 --> 00:18:10,910
[Please don't pay attention to me...]

277
00:18:12,628 --> 00:18:16,981
I just want to rest.
That's my honest answer.

278
00:18:16,981 --> 00:18:20,378
If you are a member of the Mafia,
you're really good at this game.

279
00:18:21,665 --> 00:18:24,544
[I've been acting for 26 years...]

280

exempt from the selection.</i>

your job to bring back matching items.</i>

item as someone else...</i>

289

<i>the person who came later must go back
and get another item of the same initial.</i>

<i>Please remember that this is an
individual race.</i>

291
00:19:12,428 --> 00:19:19,193
<i>After this round, the members of the Mafia
will get to know each other's identities.</i>

292

[I finally get to know my fellow
Mafia members!]

293
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:25,344
It might end up harming the Mafia.

294
00:19:25,344 --> 00:19:28,195
It might put an extra burden on them.

295
00:19:30,129 --> 00:19:34,152
[Everyone is a contender so far.]

296
00:19:34,152 --> 00:19:38,134
The initials of the first round have
two letters.

297

One moment, please.

298
00:19:40,249 --> 00:19:45,011
We can't discuss what the item is even though
we might have an idea after hearing the initials.

[What?]

300
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:49,687
- Of course!
- Isn't that obvious?

301

- Why would we talk about it?
- What if it just comes out?

302
00:19:51,832 --> 00:19:58,105
Do you think he's capable of being
in the Mafia? He's not!

303
00:19:59,501 --> 00:20:03,050
- He might be acting.
- He's just like you, Suk Jin!

[But what if this clumsiness is a highly
calculated act?]

G and J.

307
00:20:11,806 --> 00:20:14,187

[A moment ago]
Do you have a clock?

- Why?

- We'll eat naan.

00:32:42,006 --> 00:32:44,564
I guess we should wash the tomatoes too.

508
00:32:44,564 --> 00:32:46,791
Hey, our pride depends on this.

509
00:32:47,505 --> 00:32:51,440
- I'll have them wash these!
- Have them wash everything!

510
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:54,140
- This is our pride!
- We'll be their bosses!

511
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:56,429
But do you think he'll be angry
if we include scallions?

512
00:32:56,429 --> 00:32:58,152
It'll be a challenge.

513
00:32:58,610 --> 00:33:01,204
Excuse me, Dong Joon!

514
00:33:03,509 --> 00:33:04,578
What's up?

515
00:33:04,891 --> 00:33:06,484
Can you come over?

516
00:33:08,514 --> 00:33:10,589
Come over here.

517
00:33:11,127 --> 00:33:14,281
- Hey, Jae Suk...
- We only need you!

518
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:17,260
We only need you, Dong Joon!

519
00:33:18,604 --> 00:33:20,253
Where are you going, Dong Joon?

520
00:33:20,253 --> 00:33:22,772
- Just you, Dong Joon!
- It's okay, Jae Suk!

521
00:33:26,193 --> 00:33:28,352
- Would you mind washing these too?
- Not at all.

522
00:33:28,368 --> 00:33:30,710
[Dumping work on nice Dong Joon.]

523
00:33:31,549 --> 00:33:36,397
Just remember this.
You're higher than Jae Suk.

524
00:33:36,397 --> 00:33:38,021
- Is that so?
- Of course.

525
00:33:38,021 --> 00:33:40,170
Go and tell him to do this.

526
00:33:40,170 --> 00:33:43,278
- Me?
- Yes. You tell him.

527
00:33:43,278 --> 00:33:45,009
- I'll be back.
- Alright.

528
00:33:45,316 --> 00:33:49,338
You're higher than Jae Suk!

529
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:54,170
Jae Suk!

530
00:33:54,993 --> 00:33:57,832
Ha Ha told me to tell you...

531
00:33:57,832 --> 00:34:00,023
that you should wash all these.

532
00:34:00,023 --> 00:34:01,407
Okay!

533
00:34:01,799 --> 00:34:04,806
[Okay?]

534
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,694
Ha Dong Hoon!

535
00:34:10,357 --> 00:34:12,494
- Ha Dong Hoon!
- Yes, sir!

536
00:34:12,494 --> 00:34:14,234
Come here!

537
00:34:15,656 --> 00:34:17,164
Come here now!

538
00:34:17,337 --> 00:34:19,945
- I'm working now!
- Come here!

539
00:34:20,469 --> 00:34:23,179
- I'm really working!
- Come here now!

540
00:34:24,408 --> 00:34:27,667
- Come here now!
- Why? I'm working!

541
00:34:30,179 --> 00:34:32,828
- Wash these.
- Wash what?

542
00:34:32,828 --> 00:34:36,089
- I have work to do up there.
- Just come wash them.

543
00:34:36,089 --> 00:34:38,583
Go inside and wash them.

544
00:34:38,583 --> 00:34:47,360
- I'll wash them!
- Hurry up!

545
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:50,801
- I was working up there before!
- Just wash them! I'll be back.

546
00:34:50,801 --> 00:34:52,895
[I won't forget this...]

547
00:34:54,116 --> 00:34:57,310
[Min Jong and Gary didn't pass
the second round...]

548
00:34:57,310 --> 00:34:59,488
[The third pair of initials are O and Y.]

549
00:34:59,488 --> 00:35:02,108
What do you have that has
the letters O and Y?

550
00:35:02,154 --> 00:35:05,396
Oh Yi! (Cucumber)
Do you have a cucumber! I'll buy one.

551
00:35:05,746 --> 00:35:07,194
How much is this cucumber?

552
00:35:07,802 --> 00:35:10,341
[He must be first or second in this round
to be exempt from the selection.]

553
00:35:10,341 --> 00:35:14,061
I don't have much time, ma'am!
Please!

554
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:18,035
[Kkuk rushes to the grocery store.]

555
00:35:18,063 --> 00:35:20,378
Do you have a cucumber?

556
00:35:20,378 --> 00:35:23,129
[He is looking for the same thing
as Kwang Soo!]

557
00:35:23,129 --> 00:35:24,956
Is there something else with O and Y?

558
00:35:26,929 --> 00:35:28,775
I don't think this will work.

559
00:35:29,992 --> 00:35:31,723
What else has O and Y?

560
00:35:35,243 --> 00:35:37,046
Oo Yoo is too easy, right? (Milk)

561
00:35:39,673 --> 00:35:42,372
[Jung Nan is the first one!]

562
00:35:44,097 --> 00:35:46,497
[She takes first place with milk!]

563
00:35:47,654 --> 00:35:50,291
You're trying so hard, Jung Nan!

564
00:35:50,291 --> 00:35:55,099
[Is she trying to avoid the selection
because she's a Mafia?]

565
00:35:57,414 --> 00:35:59,759
[Only one slot left for the selection
exemption!]

566
00:35:59,759 --> 00:36:01,421
I'll lose this if they already have this.

567
00:36:01,421 --> 00:36:03,640
[Could it be Big-nosed Brother?]

568
00:36:04,339 --> 00:36:05,553
I'll be back.

569
00:36:05,553 --> 00:36:08,023
[He also got milk!]

570
00:36:08,023 --> 00:36:10,679
[More shopping for him!]

571
00:36:12,931 --> 00:36:16,012
[Who will be exempt from the selection?]

572
00:36:16,904 --> 00:36:19,299
[Fully charged tiger]

573
00:36:19,299 --> 00:36:20,887
What is this?

574
00:36:20,887 --> 00:36:23,098
[Tiger passes Giraffe!]

575
00:36:27,455 --> 00:36:30,491
[Kkuk passes with cucumber by a second!]

576
00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:33,832
It's over!

577
00:36:33,832 --> 00:36:35,500
- Who bought the milk?
- I did.

578
00:36:37,732 --> 00:36:41,634
[Jung Nan gets the exemption
twice in a row!]

579
00:36:42,289 --> 00:36:44,391
<i>We have two survivors.</i>

580
00:36:44,391 --> 00:36:49,723
<i>Jung Nan and Jong Kook will be exempt
from this selection.</i>

581
00:36:51,144 --> 00:36:57,307
Everyone has ten minutes to discuss.

582
00:36:58,182 --> 00:37:01,433
[I can't be picked here...]

583
00:37:08,363 --> 00:37:16,850
In my opinion, it must be Min Jong.

584
00:37:16,850 --> 00:37:19,007
[Surprise]

585
00:37:19,007 --> 00:37:23,723
I told this to Kwang Soo already.

586
00:37:23,723 --> 00:37:32,269
He's been telling us that he doesn't feel very
well because he got nausea from the sea.

587
00:37:32,269 --> 00:37:38,036
But he was completely fine on the bus ride
here even though it was pretty bumpy.

588
00:37:39,058 --> 00:37:40,953
- Are you okay?
[Inside of the bus before the market]

589
00:37:40,953 --> 00:37:43,594
I think the abalone that I had for lunch
is giving me a stomachache.

590
00:37:45,364 --> 00:37:48,632
- Is it indigestion?
- Do you want to take medicine?

591
00:37:48,632 --> 00:37:51,812
- I just want to take a break. Really.
- You do seem like you need it.

592
00:37:52,806 --> 00:37:56,768
[While Min Jong was tricking everyone
to believe him...]

593
00:37:59,162 --> 00:38:02,616
[Joo Hwan was staring at Min Jong.]

594
00:38:02,616 --> 00:38:05,714
[He's a little suspicious.]

595
00:38:05,714 --> 00:38:09,050
[Did Joo Hwan realize something?]

596
00:38:14,010 --> 00:38:17,622
[He's perfectly fine on this bumpy road.]

597
00:38:18,738 --> 00:38:25,122
[Joo Hwan didn't miss the clue, while
everyone was getting duped by Min Jong.]

598
00:38:25,122 --> 00:38:28,957
[Joo Hwan the Sherlock!]

599
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:33,949
But he was completely fine on the bus ride
here even though it was pretty bumpy.

600
00:38:33,949 --> 00:38:37,274
[Caught by surprise]

601
00:38:37,458 --> 00:38:40,478
He looks angry!
It's just a game, Min Jong!

602
00:38:41,810 --> 00:38:43,221
No, it's a feasible theory.

603
00:38:43,276 --> 00:38:46,383
So he decided to act like he's sick
after getting the motion sickness...

604
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:51,391
Just think about...
and stop talking nonsense...

605
00:38:51,391 --> 00:38:54,335
[Min Jong's disguise is coming off quickly.]

606
00:38:54,672 --> 00:38:59,186
I thought it would be Jung Nan,
but she's exempt from this selection.

607
00:39:00,669 --> 00:39:05,803
I think Seung Soo was pretty obvious
with his slapstick comedy before.

608
00:39:05,803 --> 00:39:08,759
You can't do this to me.

609
00:39:09,689 --> 00:39:13,737
I think he definitely saw the soy sauce,
but he brought one again to look stupid.

610
00:39:13,737 --> 00:39:17,754
- I can tell from his face.
- I think it might be one of the women.

611
00:39:17,754 --> 00:39:20,955
I think it must be one of the women,
and one of the original members.

612
00:39:20,955 --> 00:39:23,334
And Ji Hyo fits the bill.

613
00:39:23,334 --> 00:39:27,520
So are you saying that if it's not me,
one of these two women must be it?

614
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,855
- It doesn't have to be.
- It doesn't, but think about it.

615
00:39:29,855 --> 00:39:31,850
I'm really not it.

616
00:39:31,903 --> 00:39:33,755
- Hey Sang Hwa, are you it?
- I really am not.

617
00:39:33,755 --> 00:39:35,494
Let's go with Ji Hyo for now.

618
00:39:35,494 --> 00:39:38,554
Gary is trying to protect Sang Hwa.

619
00:39:38,554 --> 00:39:41,159
- I'm really not it.
- Gary has been protecting Sang Hwa for a while.

620
00:39:41,159 --> 00:39:43,366
[Blank Ji thinks it could be Gary.]

621
00:39:43,366 --> 00:39:46,766
- Me?
- Think about it. It could be him.

622
00:39:46,766 --> 00:39:48,657
She can immediately tell when I lie.

623
00:39:48,657 --> 00:39:51,871
There is no one else in this world
who's better at detecting my lies than Ji Hyo.

624
00:39:51,871 --> 00:39:54,055
Better than my own mother!

625
00:39:54,055 --> 00:39:57,850
But if she is blaming me now,
that means she is very desperate!

626
00:39:57,850 --> 00:39:59,621
The fact that she's questioning me now means
she is trying to deflect this!

627
00:39:59,692 --> 00:40:01,603
I don't think it's Gary.

628
00:40:01,603 --> 00:40:07,058
I told you this. I think there is one
or two Mafia members among us women.

629
00:40:07,058 --> 00:40:09,941
But I'm not it.
So it means that it's either one of them.

630
00:40:11,158 --> 00:40:13,094
Why are you being so desperate?

631
00:40:13,094 --> 00:40:15,167
I'm so frustrated!
Just think about it...

632
00:40:15,167 --> 00:40:18,537
Now I know why girls always cried
every time we played this game back in school.

633
00:40:18,537 --> 00:40:21,159
That's right.
Someone always ended up crying.

634
00:40:21,159 --> 00:40:24,440
I lost some friends forever
while playing this game.

635
00:40:26,506 --> 00:40:30,013
There were many times when my friends
flipped the tables while playing.

636
00:40:30,013 --> 00:40:34,922
I think we are most suspicious of Ji Hyo.
Let's pick her.

637
00:40:34,922 --> 00:40:38,842
Fine. But you'll regret it big time
if I turn out to be a civilian.

638
00:40:40,611 --> 00:40:42,593
Can we not play games like this?

639
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:48,023
Wait a minute.
Shouldn't we bring Seung Soo with her?

640
00:40:48,023 --> 00:40:50,017
I've been suspicious of him since
the beginning.

641
00:40:50,017 --> 00:40:54,547
He's like a grey hair.
You can pluck it anytime.

642
00:40:54,547 --> 00:40:57,468
[Always ready to be plucked.]

643
00:40:57,468 --> 00:40:59,180
But it might be better to pluck it early.

644
00:41:00,783 --> 00:41:04,850
I think the most people talked about Min Jong
and Ji Hyo. Can we go with those two?

645
00:41:05,249 --> 00:41:06,491
Ji Hyo really might not be it.

646
00:41:06,491 --> 00:41:10,937
I think I really know who it is.

647
00:41:10,937 --> 00:41:14,856
- Who?
- I think I know, but I can't speak.

648
00:41:14,856 --> 00:41:18,361
[Excuse me, but we're making a TV show...]

649
00:41:18,361 --> 00:41:20,694
[Would you prefer to keep it as your
personal memory?]

650
00:41:21,205 --> 00:41:23,733
Everyone here is trapped.

651
00:41:23,733 --> 00:41:28,512
Suk Jin is leading every discussion right now.

652
00:41:29,047 --> 00:41:33,231
I just talk a lot!
[Could it be the leader of discussions, Suk Jin?]

653
00:41:34,792 --> 00:41:36,933
- Are you a member of the Mafia?
- Me?

654
00:41:36,933 --> 00:41:38,470
- Are you?
- No.

655
00:41:38,602 --> 00:41:39,762
- Are you?
- No.

656
00:41:39,762 --> 00:41:42,123
- Are you?
- What are you doing?

657
00:41:43,456 --> 00:41:47,445
I think Seung Soo has become slightly annoying...

658
00:41:47,445 --> 00:41:49,725
Maybe we can pluck him and Ji Hyo out.

659
00:41:51,093 --> 00:41:53,758
<i>I think Suk Jin is acting right now!</i>

660
00:41:55,582 --> 00:41:57,804
Why are you doing this to me
all of a sudden?

661
00:41:57,804 --> 00:42:00,136
What's wrong with you?

662
00:42:00,136 --> 00:42:02,231
[Who can I corner so I can survive?]

663
00:42:02,335 --> 00:42:05,878
- You're it, Suk Jin. Aren't you?
- You know me well! I'm not it!

664
00:42:05,878 --> 00:42:09,976
Why are you cornering me?
Ji Hyo is being weird!

665
00:42:09,976 --> 00:42:14,421
[Will they find a Mafia?]

666
00:42:14,421 --> 00:42:18,850
- 10 seconds!
[Or will they remove a civilian?]

667
00:42:18,850 --> 00:42:20,311
Please come clean!

668
00:42:20,311 --> 00:42:21,529
I don't think these two are it.

669
00:42:21,529 --> 00:42:24,529
I pick Suk Jin and Joo Hwan.

670
00:42:25,474 --> 00:42:30,858
<i>Five, four, three, two, one...</i>

671
00:42:30,858 --> 00:42:32,926
[Could it be Suk Jin with his awkward face?]

672
00:42:32,926 --> 00:42:35,414
[Or Ji Hyo,
an expert of psychological warfare?]

673
00:42:35,414 --> 00:42:39,241
[Will Min Jong the Mafia get away this time?]

674
00:42:40,412 --> 00:42:42,925
[Discussion Ends]

675
00:42:42,925 --> 00:42:47,303
<i>If you think Kwang Soo is in the Mafia,
please raise your hand.</i>

676
00:42:51,050 --> 00:42:53,124
[Kwang Soo gets zero votes.]

677
00:42:53,124 --> 00:42:56,456
This really feels good.
I love you all.

678
00:42:56,456 --> 00:42:58,825
Don't force me to raise my hand
right now.

679
00:43:00,108 --> 00:43:03,980
Please raise your hand if you think
Joo Hwan is a Mafia.

680
00:43:06,722 --> 00:43:09,548
- Why all of a sudden?
[Joo Hwan gets one vote]

681
00:43:09,548 --> 00:43:12,906
[Criticisms abound]

682
00:43:12,906 --> 00:43:19,044
Please raise your hand
if you think Suk Jin is a Mafia.

683
00:43:19,044 --> 00:43:21,245
[Suk Jin gets one vote]
- She is driving me crazy!

684
00:43:21,948 --> 00:43:25,031
Please raise your hand
if you think Min Jong is a Mafia.

685
00:43:25,031 --> 00:43:27,136
[Nervous]

686
00:43:27,136 --> 00:43:33,536
[Will he be able to survive this crisis?]

687
00:43:36,601 --> 00:43:39,471
[Min Jong gets four votes]

688
00:43:39,471 --> 00:43:42,901
[Is this really the end?]

689
00:43:42,901 --> 00:43:46,792
Please raise your hand
if you think Seung Soo is a Mafia.

690
00:43:46,792 --> 00:43:50,401
[Seung Soo gets two votes]

691
00:43:51,806 --> 00:43:54,176
They're smart. Very smart.

692
00:43:57,524 --> 00:43:59,169
[Zero votes for Sang Hwa and Gary.]

693
00:43:59,728 --> 00:44:02,750
Please raise your hand
if you think Ji Hyo is a Mafia.

694
00:44:05,035 --> 00:44:07,062
She has two votes?
We have a tie then!

695
00:44:07,062 --> 00:44:09,007
We will have a second round of voting.

696
00:44:09,007 --> 00:44:12,181
But let's confirm that Min Jong has
been chosen first.

697
00:44:12,181 --> 00:44:14,636
Who are tied?

698
00:44:14,636 --> 00:44:18,250
We will now vote one more time
between these two.

699
00:44:19,143 --> 00:44:20,587
They're both very strong candidates!

700
00:44:20,882 --> 00:44:22,178
Listen to me rationally.

701
00:44:22,178 --> 00:44:25,198
Please raise your hand
if you think Seung Soo is a Mafia.

702
00:44:26,445 --> 00:44:28,864
[Seung Soo gets two votes.
That means Ji Hyo gets six.]

703
00:44:28,956 --> 00:44:31,746
Fine. Just remember that it's between
those two. Think carefully!

704
00:44:32,510 --> 00:44:35,260
Ji Hyo, if you're a civilian,
think of this as a sacrifice for all civilians.

705
00:44:35,260 --> 00:44:37,130
I'm dying to find out!

706
00:44:38,263 --> 00:44:41,320
[The moment of truth]

707
00:44:41,482 --> 00:44:47,475
[Now that it has come down to this,
Ji Hyo can't be a Mafia member...]

708
00:44:47,761 --> 00:44:50,941
[Starting with Blank Ji]

709
00:44:56,926 --> 00:45:01,139
<i>You are...</i>

710
00:45:01,139 --> 00:45:07,121
[Has Blank Ji, who caught many members by
surprise before, done it again?]

711
00:45:08,416 --> 00:45:10,489
<i>You are...</i>

712
00:45:14,908 --> 00:45:17,327
[Blank Ji was a civilian!]

713
00:45:17,327 --> 00:45:22,713
You are a civilian today.

714
00:45:23,952 --> 00:45:25,794
<i>I said I'm not it!</i>

715
00:45:26,039 --> 00:45:28,421
It's one of those two!

716
00:45:28,421 --> 00:45:30,097
We lost!
It's over!

717
00:45:30,225 --> 00:45:32,870
Why did you start blaming them?

718
00:45:33,959 --> 00:45:36,027
Am I a Mafia?

719
00:45:36,156 --> 00:45:37,924
Now he is confused about his
own identity!

720
00:45:37,924 --> 00:45:40,611
Please remove the tag at three.

721
00:45:40,611 --> 00:45:44,256
[Time to check Min Jong.]

722
00:45:44,977 --> 00:45:46,737
- One...
- It's Suk Jin!

723
00:45:46,737 --> 00:45:49,597
Two...
Three!

724
00:45:51,330 --> 00:45:53,505
[Mafia]
[Ta-da!]

725
00:45:54,928 --> 00:46:00,761
[Min Jong the Mafia has been arrested!]

726
00:46:01,713 --> 00:46:03,824
[I almost made it...]

727
00:46:05,441 --> 00:46:09,475
[Shock and awe]

728
00:46:10,586 --> 00:46:12,412
A shiver went down my spine!

729
00:46:15,546 --> 00:46:21,037
You are a member of the Mafia today.

730
00:46:24,291 --> 00:46:25,639
He's it!

731
00:46:27,616 --> 00:46:30,841
- He was right!
[Sherlock Joo Hwan caught his acting!]

732
00:46:34,285 --> 00:46:36,075
He's not even sick!
He was just acting!

733
00:46:36,075 --> 00:46:38,322
I think it should've been these two!

734
00:46:43,658 --> 00:46:46,287
So you pretended to be sick?

735
00:46:46,287 --> 00:46:49,094
Yes.

736
00:46:49,094 --> 00:46:50,475
We thought you were really sick!

737
00:46:50,475 --> 00:46:52,518
Did Jong Kook catch me?

738
00:46:52,518 --> 00:46:54,270
No, Joo Hwan did.

739
00:46:54,270 --> 00:46:57,376
You were sick from motion sickness earlier,
but you were fine on the bumpy bus ride here.

740
00:46:57,376 --> 00:47:00,096
I should've opened the window
and acted more.

741
00:47:02,172 --> 00:47:03,673
Great job, Joo Hwan!

742
00:47:04,754 --> 00:47:06,564
It's been fun.

743
00:47:10,389 --> 00:47:16,500
[Min Jong the Mafia and Blank Ji are removed
after the third mission!]

744
00:47:19,324 --> 00:47:23,193
Now I'm scared of people.
Really scared.

745
00:47:31,019 --> 00:47:33,885
[Two members of the Mafia vs. Six civilians]

746
00:47:37,445 --> 00:47:39,731
There's no one here, right?

747
00:47:43,570 --> 00:47:45,421
[Instant coffee?!]

748
00:47:48,289 --> 00:47:50,370
This is the main sauce.

749
00:47:50,370 --> 00:47:53,987
[Instant coffee is the secret ingredient of
the Gargamel Curry?]

750
00:47:55,762 --> 00:47:58,439
[One more!]

751
00:48:02,817 --> 00:48:04,170
[Adding three packs of instant coffee.]

752
00:48:04,170 --> 00:48:11,187
You'll soon be speechless
when you taste this mindblowing curry.

753
00:48:11,187 --> 00:48:13,132
[Yes, we're speechless...]

754
00:48:13,132 --> 00:48:16,232
People can't find out that I put these in.

755
00:48:16,232 --> 00:48:18,386
[Quickly getting rid of the evidence.]

756
00:48:18,386 --> 00:48:21,326
It's not really dissolving.

757
00:48:27,065 --> 00:48:28,806
This will be my first attempt at this.

758
00:48:28,806 --> 00:48:31,199
[No! Strawberry Jam!]

759
00:48:31,563 --> 00:48:33,507
My first attempt...

760
00:48:37,304 --> 00:48:40,415
In Korea, we must do things in three.

761
00:48:40,415 --> 00:48:42,940
- Did you talk to Ha Ha about this?
- No, he has no idea.

762
00:48:45,674 --> 00:48:47,584
It looks delicious, doesn't it?

763
00:48:47,584 --> 00:48:50,083
[The chef himself is very satisfied.]

764
00:48:50,597 --> 00:48:55,014
I don't know if they will go well together,
but I'm going to put these abalones in.

765
00:49:00,468 --> 00:49:02,748
We should eat these fried eggs now!

766
00:49:02,815 --> 00:49:04,658
[Jae Suk and Dong Joon fried 30 eggs
in a heartbeat!]

767
00:49:05,712 --> 00:49:09,345
- You are great.
- Of course.

768
00:49:10,912 --> 00:49:13,398
[Confident]

769
00:49:13,398 --> 00:49:15,338
We should eat these now.

770
00:49:18,923 --> 00:49:23,419
- All of you must keep moving.
- Yes, sir. We are.

771
00:49:25,682 --> 00:49:27,944
I thought you said you're the boss?

772
00:49:27,944 --> 00:49:30,865
I'm just letting him have his moment.
Otherwise it'll never end.

773
00:49:35,387 --> 00:49:37,696
You're not just letting me have my moment,
are you?

774
00:49:38,634 --> 00:49:41,117
[He has great hearing.]

775
00:49:41,133 --> 00:49:43,692
I don't know who they are,
but the Mafia is doing very well.

776
00:49:43,692 --> 00:49:46,041
- I think they are doing great.
- Jong Kook must be working hard.

777
00:49:46,041 --> 00:49:48,229
I said Jong Kook is a Mafia!

778
00:49:50,109 --> 00:49:52,483
- Could it be Seung Soo and Sang Hwa?

779
00:49:54,425 --> 00:49:56,297
I can't trust anyone anymore.

780
00:49:56,999 --> 00:49:59,926
- I don't think Gary is it.
- Because I'm not.

781
00:49:59,926 --> 00:50:01,516
He's being very natural right now.

782
00:50:01,516 --> 00:50:05,760
<i>We have two members of the Mafia
in here right now.</i>

783
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:10,477
<i>And now they are aware of each
other's identity.</i>

784
00:50:13,708 --> 00:50:17,119
It must be hard for them to not laugh
when they look at each other.

785
00:50:17,119 --> 00:50:19,388
I don't think I can perform
regular social functions after this.

786
00:50:19,388 --> 00:50:22,713
I can't trust people anymore!

787
00:50:23,218 --> 00:50:34,114
[Who are the two members of the
Mafia among them?]

788
00:50:34,452 --> 00:50:36,998
But Seung Soo, you're being so natural.
I don't think it's you.

789
00:50:37,225 --> 00:50:40,432
His acting is getting better after
each mission!

790
00:50:40,432 --> 00:50:45,785
It was so awkward in the beginning!

791
00:50:50,307 --> 00:50:53,421
- I think Suk Jin is being strange right now.
- I agree.

792
00:50:53,421 --> 00:50:56,692
[Now Big Nosed Brother is under attack!]

793
00:50:56,692 --> 00:50:59,315
Suk Jin, look straight in my eye.
I'm really not it.

794
00:50:59,417 --> 00:51:03,149
Suk Jin, if you're a Mafia,
then you have played me pretty badly!

795
00:51:05,603 --> 00:51:07,500
I saw it.

796
00:51:07,657 --> 00:51:11,220
What should I do?
I saw it.

797
00:51:11,220 --> 00:51:12,810
[Huh? You saw what?]

798
00:51:12,810 --> 00:51:15,621
I saw the hidden claw.

799
00:51:16,084 --> 00:51:20,972
- I saw it finally.
[His bluffing has gotten better along with his acting.]

800
00:51:21,846 --> 00:51:24,325
I thought it was Jung Nan,
but she's not it.

801
00:51:24,325 --> 00:51:27,674
- She's not capable of detailed acting.
- What kind of detailed acting?

802
00:51:27,674 --> 00:51:35,070
After saying that you've played her if you're
a Mafia, she made that hand gesture.

803
00:51:41,060 --> 00:51:43,603
That hand movement was so
natural and detailed.

804
00:51:43,867 --> 00:51:45,073
- Really?
- Yes!

805
00:51:45,073 --> 00:51:46,636
<i>I promise you, it was all natural.</i>

806
00:51:46,636 --> 00:51:50,284
I can tell that such a natural gesture
can't be acted out.

807
00:51:50,284 --> 00:51:53,911
- But she is a good actor.
- Now we must examine everyone here carefully.

808
00:51:53,911 --> 00:51:56,957
She is a great actor, but such natural
movement can't be acted out.

809
00:51:57,763 --> 00:52:00,614
I saw it. But Suk Jin!

810
00:52:00,934 --> 00:52:07,064
I also saw that your eyes, albeit very slightly,
moved when Jung Nan said that.

811
00:52:10,674 --> 00:52:12,457
- What should I do?
- What's wrong with you?

812
00:52:12,457 --> 00:52:14,991
If I get removed, you guys lose!

813
00:52:16,443 --> 00:52:18,844
This is driving me nuts!

814
00:52:19,173 --> 00:52:21,425
You're a true professional, Suk Jin.

815
00:52:22,966 --> 00:52:26,303
[Seung Soo's bluffing shines when he
makes inferences.]

816
00:52:27,885 --> 00:52:31,080
If Seung Soo is a Mafia, I swear
that I'll never see anyone ever again.

817
00:52:32,442 --> 00:52:36,472
I'll never see anyone ever again!
I'll just go into a mountain and become a hermit.

818
00:52:36,472 --> 00:52:40,928
So would you be surprised more if I'm a Mafia?
Or if I'm a civilian?

819
00:52:40,928 --> 00:52:42,943
- It'd be a surprise either way.
- Right?

820
00:52:45,100 --> 00:52:46,563
This is frustrating.

821
00:52:47,522 --> 00:52:52,076
[We are continuing to the next mission,
full of doubts.]

822
00:52:54,549 --> 00:52:58,773
[They have arrived at the last mission site:
a cabbage farm.]

823
00:52:59,083 --> 00:53:00,402
I wear these quite often!

824
00:53:00,402 --> 00:53:03,235
[The mission begins with work pants
and boots.]

825
00:53:03,345 --> 00:53:07,405
If Seung Soo turns out to be Mafia,
my life would lose its purpose altogether.

826
00:53:07,706 --> 00:53:10,389
If Seung Soo is Mafia,
there is no reason for me to continue living!

827
00:53:10,389 --> 00:53:13,009
I'll give you hope.
I'm really not it.

828
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:16,394
Why are they sticking together?
That's strange.

829
00:53:16,394 --> 00:53:19,844
Hey! They're sticking together!

830
00:53:19,844 --> 00:53:22,029
[It's time to doubt Suk Jin and Sang Hwa.]

831
00:53:23,094 --> 00:53:25,780
Gary, thanks for that valuable piece
of information!

832
00:53:26,604 --> 00:53:30,579
It must be Jong Kook and Joo Hwan.
They exchanged some kind of signal.

833
00:53:30,579 --> 00:53:35,662
They just looked at each other
and smiled!

834
00:53:35,730 --> 00:53:38,350
- Seung Soo, you're not it, right?
- I really am not.

835
00:53:38,350 --> 00:53:41,513
- Then why did you pretend like you were Mafia?
- What did I do?

836
00:53:41,513 --> 00:53:44,208
- When cornered, people's behaviors change.
- Pretended to be Mafia?

837
00:53:44,315 --> 00:53:46,235
Please stand right here.

838
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:48,646
<i>Did you find every member of the Mafia?</i>

839
00:53:48,646 --> 00:53:50,729
- Yes, almost!
- 80% there!

840
00:53:50,729 --> 00:53:52,727
I saw everything!

841
00:53:53,870 --> 00:53:56,094
But we have to pick two...

842
00:53:56,127 --> 00:53:59,444
<i>This would be your last chance to pick
those two. The last mission.</i>

843
00:53:59,444 --> 00:54:01,624
<i>It's called
"The Man from the Cabbage Farm"</i>

844
00:54:02,294 --> 00:54:06,828
<i>You'll see cabbages growing in
this field right now.</i>

845
00:54:06,828 --> 00:54:12,808
<i>First, men need to pick five cabbages per person,
and women need to pick three per person.</i>

846
00:54:12,808 --> 00:54:17,184
<i>Second, put your cabbages in those
cartwheels.</i>

847
00:54:17,856 --> 00:54:21,631
<i>Then push your cartwheels to the
finish line right here.</i>

848
00:54:21,631 --> 00:54:24,488
<i>The person who crosses
the line first wins.</i>

849
00:54:24,489 --> 00:54:27,054
- It's quite simple.
- Yes, it's simple.

850
00:54:27,296 --> 00:54:31,881
<i>We'll pick first place from the first round,
then have another round to pick second place.</i>

851
00:54:31,881 --> 00:54:35,329
<i>The first and second place holders will be
exempt from the selection process.</i>

852
00:54:36,592 --> 00:54:39,381
This means that we must stop
the most suspicious character from winning.

853
00:54:39,381 --> 00:54:40,419
<i>That's correct. </i>

854
00:54:40,419 --> 00:54:47,004
<i>It'd be important for the civilians to help
the two least suspicious characters to win.</i>

855
00:54:47,004 --> 00:54:49,031
Then let's have a cheer for the civilians!

856
00:54:49,031 --> 00:54:52,210
Cheers for the civilians!
[Every single one joined in.]

857
00:54:52,298 --> 00:54:54,422
- Get out of here!
- Why?

858
00:54:54,660 --> 00:54:57,788
- This doesn't make sense.
- This is driving me nuts!

859
00:55:00,042 --> 00:55:01,976
So whoever is trying too hard
is a suspicious character.

860
00:55:01,976 --> 00:55:04,997
In both cases of trying too hard to win,
and trying too hard to lose.

861
00:55:04,997 --> 00:55:08,234
I hereby declare that I'll take it easy on
this one! You heard me!

862
00:55:08,929 --> 00:55:11,856
It's better to have someone win.
I'll just take the first place.

863
00:55:11,856 --> 00:55:14,025
What's wrong with you, Sang Hwa?

864
00:55:14,025 --> 00:55:16,553
I'm really a civilian!

865
00:55:16,553 --> 00:55:17,514
I'm really not it.

866
00:55:17,514 --> 00:55:20,709
So Jong Kook, I'll just pick the cabbages and give
them to you. All you need to do is run.

867
00:55:20,709 --> 00:55:23,377
If you all trust me,
I'll try my best to win.

868
00:55:23,377 --> 00:55:26,031
- You can't do that.
- Relax!

869
00:55:26,031 --> 00:55:28,195
What's wrong with her?

870
00:55:29,442 --> 00:55:31,808
<i>Why can't Sang Hwa win?</i>

871
00:55:31,808 --> 00:55:34,077
We think she has to be Mafia.

872
00:55:34,077 --> 00:55:36,376
Now it'd be weird if she's not Mafia.

873
00:55:36,470 --> 00:55:38,123
We've seen too many things...

874
00:55:38,123 --> 00:55:40,878
- I am? I am a Mafia?
[Complete confusion]

875
00:55:44,391 --> 00:55:46,604
How would you be responsible for this later?

876
00:55:46,847 --> 00:55:49,647
This is the Hail Mary pass.

877
00:55:50,260 --> 00:55:52,372
You haven't acted like this so far!

878
00:55:53,197 --> 00:55:55,137
- He saw it!
- Can it be you?

879
00:55:55,137 --> 00:55:56,558
For the sake of time, let's hurry up.

880
00:55:56,558 --> 00:55:57,911
Yes, let's make this quick.

881
00:55:58,308 --> 00:56:01,485
<i>Ready, set...</i>

882
00:56:05,434 --> 00:56:10,487
[Quick harvesting means better lanes
for cartwheel racing.]

883
00:56:10,487 --> 00:52:32,080
[Helping with cabbage harvesting
while finding the Mafia.]

884
00:56:21,342 --> 00:56:28,708
[The Mafia and the civilians have come
together at this very moment.]

885
00:56:33,662 --> 00:56:35,533
[An armful]

886
00:56:38,402 --> 00:56:42,727
[First and second place holders will be exempt
from the selection process.]

887
00:56:44,853 --> 00:56:48,867
[Choosing a preferred lane.]

888
00:56:50,454 --> 00:56:54,370
[After placing their precious cabbages...]

889
00:57:00,013 --> 00:57:05,692
[An unbridled dash across the cabbage farm!]

890
00:57:10,552 --> 00:57:13,586
[Sang Hwa's cabbage field skating]

891
00:57:13,586 --> 00:57:16,201
[From her gold medal race...]

892
00:57:16,201 --> 00:57:19,075
[To her race on a cabbage field]

893
00:57:19,684 --> 00:57:22,292
[The biggest contenders!]

894
00:57:22,292 --> 00:57:26,358
[Jong Kook vs. Sang Hwa!]

895
00:57:26,766 --> 00:57:28,868
Hey, block Suk Jin!

896
00:57:35,314 --> 00:57:39,121
[But at this crucial moment...]

897
00:57:43,257 --> 00:57:47,301
[A dark horse appears!]

898
00:57:49,107 --> 00:57:52,765
[Joo Hwan had a late start...]

899
00:57:54,404 --> 00:57:57,655
[But with his speedy acceleration...]

900
00:57:58,399 --> 00:58:03,979
[The game is between Joo Hwan,
Jong Kook, and Sang Hwa.]

901
00:58:04,897 --> 00:58:07,563
[Joo Hwan is getting ahead!]

902
00:58:10,027 --> 00:58:13,594
[Joo Hwan is the winner!]

903
00:58:16,427 --> 00:58:18,350
Hey, block Suk Jin!

904
00:58:18,350 --> 00:58:21,410
[Bluff Seung Soo is the only one dragging
the cartwheel backwards...]

905
00:58:23,048 --> 00:58:25,385
[A sure last place]

906
00:58:25,425 --> 00:58:27,766
Hey, does this thing even roll?

907
00:58:32,901 --> 00:58:34,846
- Who won?
- I did.

908
00:58:34,891 --> 00:58:37,706
Joo Hwan did?
Are you a good runner?

909
00:58:37,706 --> 00:58:40,363
- Why didn't you tell us?
[Joo Hwan's unexpected victory.]

910
00:58:41,279 --> 00:58:42,562
What's wrong with Joo Hwan?

911
00:58:42,562 --> 00:58:44,399
- How did Joo Hwan do?
- First place.

912
00:58:44,857 --> 00:58:46,435
Are you a Mafia?

913
00:58:48,380 --> 00:58:50,964
[Joo Hwan is exempt from the selection!]

914
00:58:52,211 --> 00:58:54,775
He isn't a good runner.
How could this be?

915
00:58:54,775 --> 00:58:57,295
- He's fast.
- Something is weird.

916
00:58:57,636 --> 00:58:59,850
- What's wrong with you all of a sudden?
- We have one more chance.

917
00:58:59,850 --> 00:59:03,067
[Did Joo Hwan try his best because
he's in the Mafia?]

918
00:59:03,067 --> 00:59:05,494
You said you won't try your best!

919
00:59:05,494 --> 00:59:10,609
- Joo Hwan gave all he had just now.
- Trust me, I'm a civilian!

920
00:59:10,609 --> 00:59:14,770
Why are you doing this to the game?
Yesterday and today...

921
00:59:14,770 --> 00:59:17,548
You told me you'll do whatever
you're told to do.

922
00:59:18,797 --> 00:59:20,071
He really gave all he had...

923
00:59:20,071 --> 00:59:24,900
That's not the problem. Our priority is to stop
the most suspicious characters from winning.

924
00:59:24,900 --> 00:59:26,849
But Joo Hwan just sprinted ahead!

925
00:59:26,849 --> 00:59:29,741
That's something a Mafia would do.

926
00:59:30,104 --> 00:59:33,622
I'm really not a Mafia.
You must trust me.

927
00:59:33,622 --> 00:59:35,768
The quiet ones are more confusing.

928
00:59:38,128 --> 00:59:40,227
- I'll sue you if you're a Mafia.
- I'm serious.

929
00:59:40,733 --> 00:59:43,217
- So Joo Hwan passes?
- Yes, he's done.

930
00:59:44,214 --> 00:59:47,496
You're being really suspicious right now.

931
00:59:47,496 --> 00:59:50,042
<i>Why can't you trust me?</i>

932
00:59:50,979 --> 00:59:56,059
<i>Joo Hwan, please stand away
from the field.</i>

933
00:59:56,059 --> 00:59:57,882
What is it?
Why did you do it?

934
00:59:58,386 --> 01:00:00,387
I'm at a great disadvantage
in this game.

935
01:00:00,387 --> 01:00:03,248
- Could it be Kwang Soo?
- Jung Nan, just take it easy.

936
01:00:03,248 --> 01:00:06,838
- Just don't wear yourself out.
- You don't need to win unless you're Mafia!

937
01:00:06,838 --> 01:00:09,462
- So I can just take the last place, right?
- Of course!

938
01:00:09,462 --> 01:00:13,747
To be honest, I'm not really concerned
about you.

939
01:00:14,339 --> 01:00:16,493
Are you being extra competitive
because you're a Mafia?

940
01:00:16,803 --> 01:00:19,561
- What?
- You don't have to get angry...

941
01:00:19,561 --> 01:00:21,760
- Why are you being so sensitive?
- I'm not angry at you.

942
01:00:22,038 --> 01:00:25,148
I'm getting a headache because
of our unexpected winner.

943
01:00:25,182 --> 01:00:27,227
But this is the situation that we
have to deal with.

944
01:00:28,495 --> 01:00:30,538
- This is never ending.
- One more race?

945
01:00:32,367 --> 01:00:34,763
Joo Hwan! You look very relaxed now!

946
01:00:35,171 --> 01:00:39,521
[Joo Hwan's bright smile is quite
suspicious...]

947
01:00:40,826 --> 01:00:41,971
I have absolutely no idea...

948
01:00:41,971 --> 01:00:45,511
[The winner of the second round also
gets the exemption from the selection.]

949
01:00:45,676 --> 01:00:49,460
We all know who the real Mafia member
is here, don't we?

950
01:00:50,522 --> 01:00:52,973
Why do you keep trying to
put this on me?

951
01:00:53,492 --> 01:00:55,139
Why me?

952
01:00:55,865 --> 01:00:59,319
- Because you saw it?
- Because I saw it.

953
01:01:02,278 --> 01:01:03,570
I must block Sang Hwa!

954
01:01:07,174 --> 01:01:13,847
[A rematch between the rivals!]
[Sang Hwa and Jong Kook!]

955
01:01:18,555 --> 01:01:23,842
[How will this race end?]

956
01:01:29,757 --> 01:01:32,310
[A collision!]

957
01:01:33,437 --> 01:01:37,048
[Doubtful Kwang Soo
checks Sang Hwa's cartwheel!]

958
01:01:37,638 --> 01:01:40,545
[While the collision is happening...]

959
01:01:40,545 --> 01:01:44,585
[Jong Kook wins the race effortlessly.]

960
01:01:46,815 --> 01:01:49,502
This is not fair!

961
01:01:49,974 --> 01:01:51,961
I had no choice!

962
01:01:51,994 --> 01:01:54,509
It's because of the muddy terrain.
I'm sorry.

963
01:01:54,509 --> 01:01:56,346
I'm sorry, Sang Hwa.
I lost control of my cartwheel.

964
01:01:58,035 --> 01:02:02,028
Hey, how could you dare to tackle
an Olympic gold medalist?

965
01:02:02,028 --> 01:02:03,986
We had a plan!
This was our plan!

966
01:02:03,986 --> 01:02:05,870
- What plan?
- Don't you remember?

967
01:02:05,870 --> 01:02:07,916
You should've played fair and square.

968
01:02:08,891 --> 01:02:11,870
- It was all planned by Jong Kook!
- I know of no such thing!

969
01:02:11,870 --> 01:02:14,128
That's not the case.

970
01:02:14,736 --> 01:02:16,960
It's a difficult race for women.

971
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:19,271
You were lagging behind Sang Hwa!

972
01:02:19,353 --> 01:02:22,761
I was just pushing my cartwheel!

973
01:02:22,922 --> 01:02:24,841
It was a bit too much in my opinion, too.

974
01:02:24,841 --> 01:02:30,628
How could you dare to hurt
Korea's proud daughter?

975
01:02:30,967 --> 01:02:34,097
[Korea's proud daughter is enjoying
this situation.]

976
01:02:35,313 --> 01:02:37,705
- You must apologize!
[Dumbfounded]

977
01:02:38,705 --> 01:02:41,956
<i>You can apologize on the way to the
final location. Let's go.</i>

978
01:02:43,407 --> 01:02:46,983
We had a good show!
[Mafia missions are complete.]

979
01:02:47,369 --> 01:02:50,035
- Sang Hwa, I sincerely apologize.
- It's fine.

980
01:02:50,339 --> 01:02:54,187
[There are two members of the Mafia left.
Will the civilians manage to arrest them?]

981
01:02:54,187 --> 01:02:55,322
Are you a Mafia?

982
01:02:55,322 --> 01:02:56,329
Are you really not it?

983
01:02:56,329 --> 01:02:58,282
We've spent four years together.
Are you really not it?

984
01:02:58,282 --> 01:03:00,304
Just stop the whole thing!

985
01:03:00,304 --> 01:03:02,292
I'm serious!
I'm a civilian!

986
01:03:02,292 --> 01:03:03,786
I'm really not it.

987
01:03:03,786 --> 01:03:05,888
You're a member of the Mafia!

988
01:03:10,713 --> 01:03:20,054
<i>The winners should sit on
the left side.</i>

989
01:03:20,625 --> 01:03:22,031
This is awesome.

990
01:03:22,031 --> 01:03:24,392
I think the civilians will win.

991
01:03:24,392 --> 01:03:26,173
Seung Soo has confused me
the whole day.

992
01:03:26,173 --> 01:03:30,689
Seung Soo is either a hilarious comedian,
or a manipulative mastermind.

993
01:03:32,235 --> 01:03:35,928
I really won't be able to trust people anymore
if Seung Soo turns out to be a Mafia.

994
01:03:36,113 --> 01:03:39,673
Seung Soo is not a Mafia.
I know.

995
01:03:40,065 --> 01:03:41,974
I'm not it.
I really wish that I could be a Mafia.

996
01:03:41,974 --> 01:03:43,944
If he's not it,
our choice gets much easier.

997
01:03:43,944 --> 01:03:47,352
- He confused me the whole day!
- The choice will be a lot easier if it isn't him!

998
01:03:47,352 --> 01:03:49,348
We should've removed him in the
very beginning.

999
01:03:49,348 --> 01:03:51,486
- I said Seung Soo isn't it!
- Why not?

1000
01:03:51,758 --> 01:03:53,967
<i>You have reached the final stage.</i>

1001
01:03:54,238 --> 01:03:57,123
<i>Please remember that if any of the
Mafia members are alive</i>

1002
01:03:57,123 --> 01:03:59,302
<i>it's a victory for the Mafia team.</i>

1003
01:03:59,303 --> 01:04:01,377
<i>There's still hope.</i>

1004
01:04:01,377 --> 01:04:07,440
<i>If both surviving Mafia members are caught,
then it's a victory for the civilians.</i>

1005
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:12,800
<i>Each member of the winning team
will get this gold badge. </i>

1006
01:04:14,712 --> 01:04:16,577
The civilians must win!

1007
01:04:16,673 --> 01:04:21,812
You have exactly ten minutes.
Start!

1008
01:04:31,421 --> 01:04:33,715
Let's begin by talking about
your personal picks.

1009
01:04:33,715 --> 01:04:35,669
I pick both of the women.

1010
01:04:35,991 --> 01:04:37,522
Just pick one for now.

1011
01:04:37,522 --> 01:04:40,532
[Gary picks Jung Nan and Sang Hwa.]

1012
01:04:40,532 --> 01:04:42,705
We must pick two in the end, anyway.

1013
01:04:43,720 --> 01:04:47,016
I thought it would be just
one of the three women.

1014
01:04:47,138 --> 01:04:48,699
Who's your pick, Sang Hwa?

1015
01:04:49,172 --> 01:04:50,971
Jung Nan is my pick.

1016
01:04:51,624 --> 01:04:54,322
- You need to pick two.
[Jung Nan under attack from the beginning.]

1017
01:04:54,322 --> 01:04:55,375
I need to pick two?

1018
01:04:55,375 --> 01:04:57,660
They were my original picks...
[She suspected Joo Hwan and Jong Kook.]

1019
01:04:57,660 --> 01:05:00,011
- But they have been excluded.
- So we can't pick them at all?

1020
01:05:02,387 --> 01:05:04,782
So it must be Jung Nan and Seung Soo.

1021
01:05:06,259 --> 01:05:07,439
What do you think?

1022
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:09,858
I also pick the women.

1023
01:05:10,209 --> 01:05:11,886
- This is nonsense.
- How about you, Suk Jin?

1024
01:05:11,886 --> 01:05:16,816
I think one of the women must be it.
But it's very confusing.

1025
01:05:16,816 --> 01:05:20,849
Shouldn't you have made up your mind
about them by now?

1026
01:05:20,849 --> 01:05:25,064
Didn't Seung Soo say it would be the women?
Gary said the same thing.

1027
01:05:25,064 --> 01:05:28,927
But that would be too much of a risk.

1028
01:05:29,571 --> 01:05:32,340
Everyone's such a great actor!
I feel like I'm watching a movie!

1029
01:05:33,740 --> 01:05:36,613
I pick both of the women too.

1030
01:05:39,064 --> 01:05:41,330
Who would you pick, Jung Nan?

1031
01:05:41,702 --> 01:05:46,175
Seung Soo and Joo Hwan were my original choices.
But since Joo Hwan's out of reach now...

1032
01:05:46,175 --> 01:05:48,670
I have no idea whom the other
person might be.

1033
01:05:49,075 --> 01:05:53,670
Let me defend myself briefly.
If you pick me as Mafia right now...

1034
01:05:53,670 --> 01:05:56,383
the whole country won't be pleased.

1035
01:05:56,383 --> 01:06:00,264
- Enough with your bluffing!
- Stop confusing us!

1036
01:06:01,363 --> 01:06:05,606
But if we do end up being right about
both of the women, it would be awesome.

1037
01:06:05,606 --> 01:06:06,944
That would be amazing.

1038
01:06:06,944 --> 01:06:11,047
- How can two women be the Mafia?
- Maybe the producers anticipated that kind of thinking.

1039
01:06:11,047 --> 01:06:13,556
There would be a greater probability of
none of us being a Mafia.

1040
01:06:13,670 --> 01:06:16,917
I feel like I'm watching Running Man on TV,
but just in real life.

1041
01:06:17,513 --> 01:06:21,426
The saddest part of this whole thing
is that the curry is going cold!

1042
01:06:21,716 --> 01:06:24,095
We were making the curry for six hours!

1043
01:06:25,074 --> 01:06:27,189
Do you know how many times
we poured more water into it?

1044
01:06:27,189 --> 01:06:30,767
- We put abalone too.
- That sounds delicious.

1045
01:06:30,767 --> 01:06:32,253
Who are your picks, Joo Hwan?

1046
01:06:32,253 --> 01:06:35,039
The members of the Mafia don't stay
loyal to each other forever.

1047
01:06:35,039 --> 01:06:36,581
They'll always end up attacking each other.

1048
01:06:37,768 --> 01:06:41,946
If we assume that Jong Kook and I are both
civilians, and there are two Mafia members there...

1049
01:06:41,946 --> 01:06:46,188
The Mafia member must either sacrifice
his partner or attack a civilian

1050
01:06:46,189 --> 01:06:48,309
because that would increase the
chance of survival.

1051
01:06:48,310 --> 01:06:50,494
You should think about
studying criminal psychology.

1052
01:06:50,915 --> 01:06:53,131
[Birth of a new crime profiler.]

1053
01:06:54,504 --> 01:06:59,350
If I am a Mafia, the Mafia member that's alive
right now has no worries. We already won.

1054
01:07:00,671 --> 01:07:05,105
[Joo Hwan the Profiler only uses logic!]

1055
01:07:07,064 --> 01:07:09,092
I saw it!

1056
01:07:13,237 --> 01:07:14,911
So are you saying that both
of the women are Mafia members?

1057
01:07:14,911 --> 01:07:20,869
I told you already!
Choosing both women is a risky move!

1058
01:07:20,869 --> 01:07:24,688
[Jung Nan and Sang Hwa are being
suspected...]

1059
01:07:26,756 --> 01:07:30,761
[They both gave their all to complete
the missions.]

1060
01:07:30,761 --> 01:07:34,981
[Is that because they're members
of the Mafia?]

1061
01:07:36,631 --> 01:07:40,606
[There were times when they
were suspected...]

1062
01:07:40,606 --> 01:07:44,843
[But they brushed it off every time.]

1063
01:07:45,411 --> 01:07:49,134
[Could it be possible that both of
the surviving Mafia members are women?]

1064
01:07:49,782 --> 01:07:53,319
Sang Hwa.
Make your case and defend yourself.

1065
01:07:53,668 --> 01:07:57,339
I'm really not it.
Because during the last race, I was trying to win.

1066
01:07:57,339 --> 01:08:00,607
I wanted to win because I wanted to
show that I'm a civilian.

1067
01:08:02,431 --> 01:08:05,609
But you guys tried very hard.
So it must be you two.

1068
01:08:07,066 --> 01:08:10,848
See? See?
Can't you see it?

1069
01:08:11,756 --> 01:08:14,366
I saw it!

1070
01:08:16,665 --> 01:08:20,615
What are you talking about?
The curry is getting cold!

1071
01:08:20,881 --> 01:08:23,165
Jung Nan, why are you not a
member of the Mafia?

1072
01:08:23,165 --> 01:08:28,394
I'm not it. It is highly unlikely
that both of the women are Mafia members.

1073
01:08:28,394 --> 01:08:31,135
It's a sure way to lose.

1074
01:08:31,220 --> 01:08:34,797
I don't think they're it either.
It'd be just one of them.

1075
01:08:34,797 --> 01:08:38,995
Because people associate men with the Mafia,
the producers may have used reverse psychology.

1076
01:08:40,575 --> 01:08:46,348
I've been saying that it would be just one of
them. But this is what we have right now.

1077
01:08:47,177 --> 01:08:48,630
I'm very confused.

1078
01:08:48,630 --> 01:08:52,476
If it has come down to picking
one woman and one man, we've lost already.

1079
01:08:52,476 --> 01:08:54,870
If any of the men are it,
it would be either Joo Hwan or Jong Kook.

1080
01:08:56,636 --> 01:09:01,766
But if one of them is a Mafia, then the surviving
Mafia in this group doesn't need to defend at all.

1081
01:09:01,766 --> 01:09:03,677
Why are you still sitting there?

1082
01:09:03,677 --> 01:09:07,048
Losers should remain silent!

1083
01:09:07,048 --> 01:09:10,426
- He's driving me crazy...
- Stop being a brat!

1084
01:09:10,426 --> 01:09:12,626
Go cook more curry!

1085
01:09:12,626 --> 01:09:15,383
He's driving me crazy!

1086
01:09:16,487 --> 01:09:21,325
Hey, Mafia people.
Make sure you're hiding well!

1087
01:09:21,325 --> 01:09:25,109
What kind of joke is that?

1088
01:09:25,109 --> 01:09:31,392
- I think it's Jong Kook.
- I'm telling you, it's him!

1089
01:09:31,392 --> 01:09:36,439
- Why are your hands so sweaty?
- My hands are always sweaty!

1090
01:09:36,439 --> 01:09:38,290
It's you, isn't it?

1091
01:09:38,290 --> 01:09:40,775
I said, I'm not it! How many
times do I have to repeat myself!

1092
01:09:40,775 --> 01:09:48,452
But I saw his awkward face that he made
when I pointed at him and called him out before.

1093
01:09:48,452 --> 01:09:52,188
- You're thinking too much.
- It's possible because it's you, Suk Jin.

1094
01:09:52,629 --> 01:09:54,324
<i>50 seconds!</i>

1095
01:09:54,324 --> 01:09:56,481
I saw his face twice before.

1096
01:09:56,785 --> 01:10:01,120
I saw Suk Jin first, then I saw Jung Nan...

1097
01:10:01,744 --> 01:10:03,803
I'm still lost.

1098
01:10:04,253 --> 01:10:06,652
You looked at me?
What did you see?

1099
01:10:06,928 --> 01:10:11,735
<i>Let's give the audience
an opportunity to present their opinion.</i>

1100
01:10:11,947 --> 01:10:15,880
- It's Suk Jin!
- Not both of the women!

1101
01:10:15,880 --> 01:10:20,328
One of the women is a Mafia,
and Suk Jin is also it.

1102
01:10:20,328 --> 01:10:22,808
I thought it was Jong Kook too.

1103
01:10:22,808 --> 01:10:25,043
But when I pointed at him just now...

1104
01:10:25,043 --> 01:10:28,708
<i>- He saw it!
- Did you see it?</i>

1105
01:10:28,708 --> 01:10:34,810
He made that familiar, perplexed face that
he's been making for the past 20 years

1106
01:10:34,811 --> 01:10:37,861
every time he's befuddled.

1107
01:10:37,862 --> 01:10:40,648
<i>I said I saw it before!</i>

1108
01:10:41,842 --> 01:10:44,492
Just think about what he talked about
on the bus!

1109
01:10:45,441 --> 01:10:46,857
I think it's Kwang Soo.

1110
01:10:47,930 --> 01:10:50,297
[The Great Chaos]

1111
01:10:50,660 --> 01:10:52,400
Sang Hwa and Kwang Soo!

1112
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:54,812
Sang Hwa and Suk Jin!

1113
01:10:54,812 --> 01:10:57,393
<i>Please calm down, everyone.</i>

1114
01:10:57,393 --> 01:10:59,650
- I just started speaking!
- No more.

1115
01:10:59,650 --> 01:11:02,013
Please raise your hand.

1116
01:11:04,276 --> 01:11:08,040
<i>If you think Gary is it, please
raise your hand. </i>

1117

<i>If you think Seung Soo is it,
please raise your hand. </i>

1121
01:11:29,137 --> 01:11:33,238

[He sees things anytime, anywhere.]

1123
01:11:34,946 --> 01:11:36,409

<i>And who did get single votes?</i>

01:12:13,718 --> 01:12:16,283
That would be Jung Nan, Suk Jin,
and Seung Soo.

1135

We'll vote again between those three.

You're making a big mistake.

- Sang Hwa is saying that the civilians have lost.
- Yes, we have.

It must be her!

01:14:50,592 --> 01:14:52,381
You're the one who played me!

1167
01:14:53,417 --> 01:14:55,607
A chill just went down my spine!

1168
01:14:56,823 --> 01:14:58,475
Awesome!

1169
01:15:04,165 --> 01:15:10,794
[Jung Nan was exempt from the selection
by trying her best during the missions.]

1170
01:15:12,310 --> 01:15:14,588
Is this thing even rolling?

1171
01:15:14,588 --> 01:15:19,152
[She even removed others' doubt
by faking her inability.]

1172
01:15:21,335 --> 01:15:23,412
<i>You are...</i>

1173
01:15:23,412 --> 01:15:27,301
<i>a member of the Mafia today.</i>

1174
01:15:28,568 --> 01:15:30,898
[A lucky arrest!]

1175
01:15:30,898 --> 01:15:34,496
So if Sang Hwa is a Mafia member,
the civilians win!

1176
01:15:38,918 --> 01:15:42,275
Sang Hwa, if you're a Mafia member, you
should just switch careers and become an actress!

1177
01:15:42,275 --> 01:15:45,754
The civilians win if Sang Hwa is
a Mafia member.

1178
01:15:45,754 --> 01:15:48,464
I really don't know...

1179
01:15:51,531 --> 01:15:55,276
- If she is a Mafia, she's magnificent.
- She really is.

1180
01:15:55,332 --> 01:15:58,309
One, two...

1181
01:16:00,406 --> 01:16:04,983
[Who will be the final winner?]

1182
01:16:07,506 --> 01:16:11,278
[Sang Hwa always tried her best
during the missions.]

1183
01:16:12,005 --> 01:16:15,315
[Is that because she's a Mafia?]

1184
01:16:16,261 --> 01:16:20,414
[If she is Mafia, the civilians win.]

1185
01:16:20,414 --> 01:16:23,312
[If not, then the Mafia wins.]

1186
01:16:24,422 --> 01:16:28,898
[What's her true identity?]

1187
01:16:33,946 --> 01:16:37,589
[The mysterious facial expressions of
the Mafia members...]

1188
01:16:42,072 --> 01:16:44,637
[Civilian]

1189
01:16:44,637 --> 01:16:49,353
[Sang Hwa was a civilian.]

1190
01:16:52,678 --> 01:16:56,954
[Arresting the Mafia has failed.]

1191
01:16:57,462 --> 01:16:59,986
- I told you that I'm a civilian!
- I told you so!

1192
01:16:59,986 --> 01:17:05,825
- I said I'm a civilian!
- I said only one of the women would be it!

1193
01:17:05,825 --> 01:17:08,779
[Everyone's confused
by this unexpected result.]

1194
01:17:08,779 --> 01:17:12,757
[Then who is the surviving Mafia?]

1195
01:17:12,757 --> 01:17:16,047
- It must be him!
- No, he's not!

1196
01:17:19,548 --> 01:17:24,021
- Suk Jin, you're great.
- It might be Jong Kook!

1197
01:17:24,643 --> 01:17:29,836
- He's it! He's cornering!
- Jong Kook, look at me!

1198
01:17:29,836 --> 01:17:32,973
Look! Look! Look!

1199
01:17:34,754 --> 01:17:36,996
He's the Mafia!

1200
01:17:38,132 --> 01:17:43,392
Look! Look!
Rip it!

1201
01:17:48,577 --> 01:17:52,608
[With his arms raised...
He really has the feel of a Mafia.]

1202
01:17:52,793 --> 01:17:55,067
I'm going to give him a roundhouse kick
if he's in the Mafia!

1203
01:17:56,384 --> 01:17:58,963
One, two...

1204
01:18:01,938 --> 01:18:04,257
He can't be it, can he?

1205
01:18:09,301 --> 01:18:11,526
[Civilian]

1206
01:18:11,526 --> 01:18:15,871
[Seung Soo was a civilian.]

1207
01:18:17,711 --> 01:18:19,595
[He was just a huge bluff...]

1208
01:18:19,595 --> 01:18:21,409
Justice is alive!

1209
01:18:23,316 --> 01:18:25,032
It's Suk Jin!

1210
01:18:25,129 --> 01:18:27,065
Do you know what made me certain
about Suk Jin?

1211
01:18:27,065 --> 01:18:31,743
When the final choice was made on
Sang Hwa and Jung Nan...

1212
01:18:31,743 --> 01:18:35,752
He just nodded to himself...

1213
01:18:38,939 --> 01:18:40,309
I saw that too.

1214
01:18:40,600 --> 01:18:45,025
- You'll find out when you rip it.
- His smirk is out!

1215
01:18:48,689 --> 01:18:52,971
[Suk Jin was a member of the Mafia!]

1216
01:19:00,215 --> 01:19:03,461
[The Mafia team wins!]

1217
01:19:03,461 --> 01:19:07,274
It was so hard,
it was so hard!

1218
01:19:09,910 --> 01:19:15,583
[He always had the same attitude.
That of an innocent civilian.]

1219
01:19:18,160 --> 01:19:20,285
How can I win this?

1220
01:19:20,757 --> 01:19:22,716
I am at a great disadvantage in this game.

1221
01:19:22,716 --> 01:19:27,650
Just take it easy.
To be honest, I'm not that concerned about you.

1222
01:19:27,921 --> 01:19:30,330
[He helped Jung Nan to avoid suspicion.]

1223
01:19:31,612 --> 01:19:38,051
[Every time they began to talk about the Mafia,
he always blamed it on someone else.]

1224
01:19:41,021 --> 01:19:48,078
[Every time he was under scrutiny,
he quickly flipped it back to the originator.]

1225
01:19:49,752 --> 01:19:53,242
<i>This is very exciting.
A lot of suspense.</i>

1226
01:19:53,404 --> 01:19:58,740
You're a member of the Mafia today.

1227
01:20:02,261 --> 01:20:05,136
We tried so hard for
the survival of these four.

1228
01:20:05,382 --> 01:20:07,315
I think Jung Nan was the best player.

1229
01:20:07,315 --> 01:20:09,589
You have no idea how hard it was for me.

1230
01:20:10,559 --> 01:20:15,816
You really surprised me.
I had no idea!

1231
01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:21,311
[Seung Soo has finally seen the real Mafia.]

1232
01:20:21,645 --> 01:20:26,252
[Final victory to the Mafia team!]

1233
01:20:26,252 --> 01:20:27,783
Thank you.

1234
01:20:27,783 --> 01:20:30,545
- I didn't do much, but I just got lucky.
- Nonsense! Everyone worked together.

1235
01:20:30,545 --> 01:20:32,941
[Awarding the gold badges to team members.]

1236
01:20:36,416 --> 01:20:39,850
[A jackpot while making curry.]

1237
01:20:40,938 --> 01:20:44,639
I got this after making the curry
for five hours.

1238
01:20:44,639 --> 01:20:46,862
<i>It's the same color as the curry!</i>

1239
01:20:49,060 --> 01:20:55,957
- Get more plates.
- Let's eat!

1240
01:20:55,957 --> 01:20:58,655
The Indian curry, Haenam style!

1241
01:20:59,026 --> 01:21:00,771
We cooked it for five hours!

1242
01:21:00,775 --> 01:21:03,618
I trust anything that's made by my
Brother Hassan!

1243
01:21:03,845 --> 01:21:09,155
<i>I don't believe,
no, I can't believe...</i>

1244
01:21:14,188 --> 01:21:16,627
Did you forget all the lyrics?

1245
01:21:16,912 --> 01:21:21,282
Thank you!

1246
01:21:23,266 --> 01:21:27,743
There is no distinction between
the Mafia and the civilians during mealtime!

1247
01:21:32,909 --> 01:21:34,352
This is not bad.

1248
01:21:37,221 --> 01:21:39,561
- This is good.
- Is it okay?

1249
01:21:41,412 --> 01:21:42,576
We cooked it, but it's still very good.

1250
01:21:42,576 --> 01:21:45,147
Every curry needs instant coffee!

1251
01:21:46,564 --> 01:21:48,743
The instant coffee brings out the taste.

1252
01:21:55,952 --> 01:22:02,456
It's been so much fun to come out today.
It was a nice break away from skating.

1253
01:22:02,456 --> 01:22:05,487
I'm also very glad that I got to make good
memories with you after the Winter Olympics.

1254
01:22:05,487 --> 01:22:10,361
I think now that we're so close,
we must meet again!
