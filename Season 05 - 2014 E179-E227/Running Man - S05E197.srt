- Yes, we will win the ddakji tournament.

519
00:34:50,743 --> 00:34:53,396
[Change the world with ddakji! Go!]

520
00:34:56,903 --> 00:34:59,072
[2:15 PM, Pusan Team arrives in Seoul]

521

[All teams to report to
the Jamshil Student Gym by 3PM]

522
00:35:05,555 --> 00:35:06,891

Okay!

526
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:18,337

527

[The undeniable nervousness now
that the time has come.]

528

[Nervousness is heightened upon
meeting opposing teams.]

532
00:35:52,575 --> 00:35:54,662
This is going to be really competitive.

533
00:35:54,662 --> 00:35:56,849
Why is everyone so fit?

534
00:35:56,849 --> 00:35:59,900

[Must not lose this fight!]

538
00:36:15,827 --> 00:36:19,736
There is something we must decide
before officially beginning the tournament.

539
00:36:19,736 --> 00:36:21,922
- What is it?
- How many teams total do we have?

540
00:36:21,922 --> 00:36:23,561
- Seven teams!
- Yes, we have seven teams.

541
00:36:23,561 --> 00:36:27,141
So we must pick a team to
automatically move on to the next round.

542
00:36:27,141 --> 00:36:36,450
So we've prepared a game for us to see
how well you can work together as a team.

543
00:36:37,453 --> 00:36:39,857
- That looks like rope.
- What is that?

544
00:36:39,857 --> 00:36:42,261
- Is it tug of war?
- One! Two! Three!

545
00:36:44,121 --> 00:36:46,050
[Special tug of war?]

546
00:36:46,050 --> 00:36:51,099
The game we've prepared is
a tug of war made for 21 people!

547
00:36:51,099 --> 00:36:56,010
There are seven sides with room
for 21 people total!

548
00:36:56,010 --> 00:37:00,282
There is a place for each person
on the team at the end of each side.

549
00:37:00,282 --> 00:37:05,674
Please wrap each band around your waist

550
00:37:05,674 --> 00:37:08,485
and look to see that three of your
colored flags are in the ground ahead of you.

551
00:37:08,485 --> 00:37:13,707
One team will win when each
team member has a flag in their hand.

552
00:37:13,707 --> 00:37:16,280
Second place and on
have no meaning.

553
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:18,530
Only first place!

554
00:37:18,530 --> 00:37:20,258
What do we do about Ji Hyo's team?

555
00:37:26,459 --> 00:37:28,621
[Strategizing before the game as
each team prepares.]

556
00:37:30,198 --> 00:37:32,105
We have to do well here.

557
00:37:32,105 --> 00:37:34,466
This won't be easy.

558
00:37:35,556 --> 00:37:39,435
Ji Wook! Hong Kyu!
One, two, three... Fighting!

559
00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:46,220
We have to lower ourselves and
crawl on the ground.

560
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:50,071
We need to stay as close
together as possible when we pull.

561
00:37:50,597 --> 00:37:53,732
You're so scientific!

562
00:37:55,739 --> 00:37:58,208
Each person needs to pull their own
flag. You can't get it for anyone else.

563
00:37:58,208 --> 00:38:00,631
Strap this on tightly. Very tight.

564
00:38:00,631 --> 00:38:03,926
[The tiger's team is all about strength,
naturally.]

565
00:38:03,926 --> 00:38:08,207
We are directly across from
Kim Jong Kook's team...

566
00:38:08,207 --> 00:38:12,477
It'd be a bit easier if we
were on the side.

567
00:38:12,477 --> 00:38:14,779
But since we are directly across...

568
00:38:15,992 --> 00:38:19,306
To be fair, we will all sit down!

569
00:38:19,306 --> 00:38:22,365
Please have a seat!

570
00:38:22,365 --> 00:38:26,149

closest to their flags.]

00:47:32,735 --> 00:47:36,268
[The crowd goes wild]

680
00:47:38,326 --> 00:47:40,680
[Chungbuk University and Yoo Jae Suk]

681
00:47:45,159 --> 00:47:47,536
[Jung Ji Wook, Yoo Jae Suk, Shin Hong Kyu]

682
00:47:47,536 --> 00:47:50,883
[Two legendary ddakji champions]

683
00:47:50,883 --> 00:47:55,397
[The energy is rising in the stadium]

684
00:47:55,397 --> 00:48:03,121
All seven teams have now
entered the arena!

685
00:48:21,907 --> 00:48:28,900
A special guest appearance today
by A-Pink!

686
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:34,600
[Energy is rising even higher with
the appearance of the six ladies.]

687
00:48:35,514 --> 00:48:37,930
Hello, we are A-Pink.

688
00:48:42,151 --> 00:48:45,214
[No No No by A-Pink]

689
00:48:53,484 --> 00:48:56,727
[A-Pink's cute and refreshing performance.]

690
00:49:16,798 --> 00:49:18,945
[Mr. Chu by A-Pink]

691
00:49:18,945 --> 00:49:22,003
[Everyone Chu together]

692
00:49:22,003 --> 00:49:24,073
[Is this real life?]

693
00:49:31,717 --> 00:49:34,534
[In an instant the performance turned
into an army base visit.]

694
00:49:40,921 --> 00:49:42,623
[Blank...]

695
00:49:57,328 --> 00:50:03,060
[A-Pink's performance...
As warm as the spring sunlight.]

696
00:50:05,650 --> 00:50:09,242
[High energy]

697
00:50:13,006 --> 00:50:17,391
We did not realize this tournament
would escalate to this level.

698
00:50:17,391 --> 00:50:22,740
Is this tournament really so important for all of
you to be here, much less for A-Pink to be here?

699
00:50:22,740 --> 00:50:25,127
I wonder if all of this is truly worth it.

700
00:50:25,127 --> 00:50:28,606
But you will all end up holding your
breath as you watch on.

701
00:50:28,606 --> 00:50:33,309
Despite their busy schedules, everyone in
A-Pink came to cheer everyone on today.

702
00:50:33,309 --> 00:50:37,025
So we can't just let you leave.
We'd like you to help draw the battles.

703
00:50:40,396 --> 00:50:43,096
This is like the World Cup of
ddakji tournaments.

704
00:50:43,096 --> 00:50:50,509
Gangwon, who automatically is entered in the
semi-finals, can be found in the top right corner.

705
00:50:53,085 --> 00:50:55,345
So the first team will be chosen...

706
00:50:55,345 --> 00:50:59,363
The first team to play in the
quarter finals is...

707
00:51:01,856 --> 00:51:07,493
Chungbuk University!

708
00:51:07,493 --> 00:51:18,078
And the next team that Eun Ji chooses
will play against the first team, Chungbuk U.

709
00:51:21,454 --> 00:51:22,657
[Anxious]

710
00:51:22,657 --> 00:51:24,803
Oh no!
I'm sorry, Pusan University!

711
00:51:24,803 --> 00:51:32,172
[The first battle
Chungbuk U vs. Pusan U.]

712
00:51:36,167 --> 00:51:37,548
Cho Rong and I both chose
our hometowns.

713
00:51:37,867 --> 00:51:38,902
Really?

714
00:51:40,170 --> 00:51:45,904
[Eun Ji from Pusan and
Cho Rong from Chungju]

715
00:51:46,999 --> 00:51:49,365
Next is Na Eun.

716
00:51:49,365 --> 00:51:51,333
Kyonggi University!

717
00:51:52,602 --> 00:51:54,858
Incheon University!

718
00:51:56,519 --> 00:52:00,695
Incheon University and Kyonggi University
will play against each other.

719
00:52:01,742 --> 00:52:04,093
Koryo University!

720
00:52:04,093 --> 00:52:06,669
Junbuk University!

721
00:52:09,909 --> 00:52:13,351
The drawing is now complete!

722
00:52:13,351 --> 00:52:15,921
A big round of applause for A-Pink!

723
00:52:17,489 --> 00:52:20,998
And we will now begin our first match.

724
00:52:20,998 --> 00:52:25,313
Chungbuk University and Pusan University!

725
00:52:25,313 --> 00:52:27,632
Please welcome them with a
big round of applause!

726
00:52:27,632 --> 00:52:36,705
The first team to three will move
on to the next round!

727
00:52:36,705 --> 00:52:42,142
The first battle! Chungbuk University
versus Pusan University!

728
00:52:42,142 --> 00:52:45,694
Players enter the ring!

729
00:52:49,683 --> 00:52:53,670
[Heated cheering competition between
the two schools.]

730
00:52:53,670 --> 00:53:00,766
To ensure that the ddakjis do not go against
regulation and they abide by the standard sizes

731
00:53:00,766 --> 00:53:04,672
only ddakjis with the R sticker
may enter the ring.

732
00:53:08,783 --> 00:53:10,884
We have someone else over there as well.

733
00:53:10,884 --> 00:53:14,060
[A second judge is inspecting
Chungbuk University's ddakjis.]

734
00:53:14,060 --> 00:53:16,372
When did you get here?
Hello.

735
00:53:17,243 --> 00:53:20,183
Nice to meet you. You must have
been called to work here at the last minute.

736
00:53:20,183 --> 00:53:23,141
I was told this was a national event...

737
00:53:23,141 --> 00:53:25,914
Is that what they told you?

738
00:53:25,990 --> 00:53:30,125
Judges have inspected the ddakjis
for each team.

739
00:53:30,125 --> 00:53:36,638
And when each ddakji passes the test,
an R sticker will be placed on each ddakji.

740
00:53:39,399 --> 00:53:43,587
We will draw numbers to determine
the order in which we will play.

741
00:53:47,294 --> 00:53:51,982
We will now begin the quarter-finals!

742
00:53:54,246 --> 00:53:58,283
[With the encouragement of their
cheer teams behind them...]

743
00:53:58,283 --> 00:54:02,210
[Each player goes up against each
other for victory.]

744
00:54:02,210 --> 00:54:06,355
We will play rock paper scissor to determine
who will place their ddakji on the ground.

745
00:54:07,420 --> 00:54:09,052
Rock paper scissor!

746
00:54:09,052 --> 00:54:12,241
[Pusan University wins.]

747
00:54:18,591 --> 00:54:21,416
Do just as we practiced.
Focus.

748
00:54:21,416 --> 00:54:24,236
Focus.
Remember what we practiced.

749
00:54:24,236 --> 00:54:28,637
Good luck, Suk Hyun!

750
00:54:28,637 --> 00:54:30,810
Let's go Pusan University!

751
00:54:33,104 --> 00:54:36,443
[Regardless of the opponent,
we cannot lose.]

752
00:54:42,027 --> 00:54:43,595
[Suk Hyun fail]

753
00:54:43,825 --> 00:54:47,979
[Victory comes so quickly,
you cannot let your guard down.]

754
00:54:47,979 --> 00:54:52,001
[Ddakji King Jae Suk's turn.]

755
00:55:05,619 --> 00:55:08,346
[Even the Ddakji King must be nervous.]

756
00:55:08,346 --> 00:55:13,658
[Each team's cheering is getting louder.]

757
00:55:13,658 --> 00:55:18,284
[Suk Hyun's second turn.]

758
00:55:22,442 --> 00:55:23,669
[What?!]

759
00:55:25,412 --> 00:55:28,929
[Suk Hyun wins!]

760
00:55:36,478 --> 00:55:39,149
[Unexpected results]

761
00:55:41,814 --> 00:55:46,999
<i>Flipped over the left hand! Flipped
over the right hand! We have Ji Hyo!</i>

762
00:55:50,721 --> 00:55:55,764
[Ji Hyo wins]

763
00:55:57,210 --> 00:55:59,777
<i>Song Ji Hyo! Song Ji Hyo!
Song Ji Hyo! Song Ji Hyo!</i>

764
00:55:59,777 --> 00:56:03,267
[One cannot look past her
just because she's a woman.]

765
00:56:13,045 --> 00:56:14,351
[Lift]

766
00:56:17,355 --> 00:56:20,320
[Jo Hyo did not succeed,
but she was very close.]

767
00:56:21,487 --> 00:56:23,500
[Ji Wook's turn]

768
00:56:27,438 --> 00:56:29,988
[Ji Wook wins!]

769
00:56:33,548 --> 00:56:36,160
[The team quickly caught up for
the score to be 1:1]

770
00:56:42,941 --> 00:56:44,859
[The ddakji master is third.]

771
00:56:49,432 --> 00:56:50,684
Be careful! Careful.

772
00:56:54,334 --> 00:56:56,317
[Hong Kyu win!]

773
00:56:59,259 --> 00:57:04,219
[Chungbuk loses twice in a row.]

774
00:57:11,707 --> 00:57:15,229
[And now the first players go
up against each other once more.]

775
00:57:17,933 --> 00:57:21,127
[I've already lost one too many times!]

776
00:57:28,114 --> 00:57:30,297
[The ddakji just bounced off.]

777
00:57:30,297 --> 00:57:32,873
You have too much power in there!

778
00:57:32,873 --> 00:57:36,399
Release some tension in our arms.

779
00:57:36,399 --> 00:57:40,619
[Blank Ji taking care of his arm.]

780
00:57:56,754 --> 00:57:59,292
[It flipped over again!]

781
00:58:01,411 --> 00:58:04,955
[Unbelievable!]

782
00:58:10,422 --> 00:58:14,850
Blank Ji's back to back victory.
The score is now tied at 2:2.

783
00:58:17,709 --> 00:58:21,524
[The unexpected rise of the weakest team,
Pusan University.]

784
00:58:24,676 --> 00:58:27,620
I will have a stand-in for this round!

785
00:58:31,306 --> 00:58:34,202
The gentleman with the glasses up there!

786
00:58:36,494 --> 00:58:39,973
[Stand-in selected from the crowd]

787
00:58:39,973 --> 00:58:42,514
Have you ever played ddakji before?

788
00:58:42,514 --> 00:58:44,834
- I've played often.
- You'll do well today?

789
00:58:44,834 --> 00:58:47,232
- You can do it?
- I can do it!

790
00:58:52,080 --> 00:58:55,137
[Tension rises with the entrance
of a new player.]

791
00:58:58,189 --> 00:59:01,750
[Stand-in looks like he can
play ddakji well.]

792
00:59:05,046 --> 00:59:06,833
Please tell us your name and major.

793
00:59:06,833 --> 00:59:10,863
I am an urban engineering
major and my name is Choi Sol.

794
00:59:14,797 --> 00:59:19,454
He is my stand-in!
Please do well on my behalf.

795
00:59:20,449 --> 00:59:22,055
- Good luck!
- Please give him a round of applause!

796
00:59:27,197 --> 00:59:28,790
Rock paper scissor!
Rock paper scissor!

797
00:59:30,029 --> 00:59:32,189
[Stand-in wins!]

798
00:59:34,557 --> 00:59:39,463
[Ji Wook vs. Choi Sol]

799
00:59:42,768 --> 00:59:45,890
[There is nowhere else to go.]

800
00:59:45,890 --> 00:59:49,544
[Each player holds the fate of their school.]

801
01:00:04,082 --> 01:00:05,651
[Now Ji Wook's turn to attack.]

802
01:00:15,376 --> 01:00:18,563
[He couldn't have gotten it again
on the first try...?]

803
01:00:25,527 --> 01:00:28,367
[Ji Wook wins!]

804
01:00:30,882 --> 01:00:34,895
[He wins once again at lightning speed!]

805
01:00:34,895 --> 01:00:40,402
[Ji Wook's outstanding performance.]

806
01:00:45,008 --> 01:00:49,962
[Entry into the semi-finals]

807
01:00:53,346 --> 01:00:56,258
[Pusan's beautiful spirit]

808
01:01:03,175 --> 01:01:07,101
A round of applause for Incheon University!

809
01:01:07,101 --> 01:01:11,024
And Kyonggi University!

810
01:01:20,457 --> 01:01:24,162
[Witty cheers pouring in from all teams.]

811
01:01:33,913 --> 01:01:37,600
Rock paper scissor!

812
01:01:38,633 --> 01:01:41,699
Rock paper scissor!

813
01:01:41,699 --> 01:01:45,031
[Gary's advantage!]

814
01:01:52,126 --> 01:01:54,132
Gary will now begin.

815
01:01:55,649 --> 01:01:58,927
The first attempt is very important.

816
01:01:58,927 --> 01:02:02,452
A very tense moment.

817
01:02:10,104 --> 01:02:12,586
[Gary fail]

818
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:23,861
[He's hit many ddakjis but never
on such a large scale.]

819
01:02:23,861 --> 01:02:26,572
[Extremely nervous]

820
01:02:31,314 --> 01:02:33,615
[Ha Ha fail]

821
01:02:33,615 --> 01:02:36,934
This is about the time
sweat starts to collect in the hands.

822
01:02:39,558 --> 01:02:43,468
[Gary's swing]

823
01:02:43,468 --> 01:02:47,302
- Shouldn't it be flipping over about now?
- Honestly, it should be flipping over about now.

824
01:02:47,302 --> 01:02:52,381
Between the ground and the ddakji--

825
01:02:53,814 --> 01:02:57,462
[Darn]

826
01:02:58,634 --> 01:03:01,378
Ha Ha may not have come down
as hard as Gary

827
01:03:01,379 --> 01:03:05,060
but he definitely hit it exactly
where he needed to.

828
01:03:07,664 --> 01:03:13,028
More than strength, this is about
hitting the center of the ddakji directly.

829
01:03:22,031 --> 01:03:27,471
And with that, Ha Ha wins!

830
01:03:30,339 --> 01:03:33,301
Ha Ha's team now leads
with one point.

831
01:03:34,818 --> 01:03:37,103
[No way...]

832
01:03:40,941 --> 01:03:45,325
Gary was more powerful
but Ha Ha was more accurate.

833
01:03:45,325 --> 01:03:48,738
Which means we have a chance
against Kim Jong Kook.

834
01:03:52,838 --> 01:03:57,723
Everyone! Please say
Kim Jong Kook is easy as pie!

835
01:03:57,723 --> 01:04:02,228
- Kim Jong Kook is--
- Easy as pie!

836
01:04:04,181 --> 01:04:06,351
Ji Suk Jin, you're being a bit
biased right now.

837
01:04:07,217 --> 01:04:09,805
Please be a little more discreet
with who it is you're cheering for.

838
01:04:09,805 --> 01:04:16,144
We have Hyun Jin from Incheon U.

839
01:04:16,144 --> 01:04:22,873
Playing him is our
volleyball player Sung Soo.

840
01:04:25,352 --> 01:04:26,958
There are powerful players.

841
01:04:26,958 --> 01:04:30,948
[Accuracy vs. Power]

842
01:04:33,484 --> 01:04:35,201
[Unbelievable power]

843
01:04:35,201 --> 01:04:40,249
Had he just hit the center of the ddakji,
it would have definitely flipped over.

844
01:04:47,125 --> 01:04:48,891
[Darn... Complete turnover]

845
01:04:53,909 --> 01:04:55,733
[Hyun Jin hit it right in the middle]

846
01:04:55,733 --> 01:04:59,283
The ddakji will not move at all
if you do not hit it in the middle.

847
01:05:04,251 --> 01:05:05,920
[Is it accuracy or power?]

848
01:05:09,452 --> 01:05:12,180
He did it!

849
01:05:12,180 --> 01:05:15,937
[Sung Soo wins!]

850
01:05:19,674 --> 01:05:21,810
It was not strong but because it hit
the middle, it flipped over.

851
01:05:23,507 --> 01:05:26,745
[Score is tied once again at 1:1]

852
01:05:30,645 --> 01:05:35,817
The ddakji's condition and energy
in the stadium are all different

853
01:05:35,817 --> 01:05:38,307
so it's hard to predict what
will happen next.

854
01:05:38,307 --> 01:05:40,893
The score is now 1 to 1.

855
01:05:42,152 --> 01:05:43,672
Back to square one.

856
01:05:47,389 --> 01:05:50,263
[Dong Jun succeeds on the first try!]

857
01:05:50,263 --> 01:05:52,544
He hit that right in the middle.

858
01:05:52,544 --> 01:05:55,099
That's right!
He hit it dead in the center!

859
01:05:55,099 --> 01:06:00,743
Kyonggi University is now leading 2 to 1.

860
01:06:00,743 --> 01:06:05,544
Initially, Incheon was confident
they'd defeat Kyonggi U.

861
01:06:05,544 --> 01:06:09,007
But there has been an unexpected
turn of events!

862
01:06:09,007 --> 01:06:13,734
- Ha Ha's Incheon was a strong candidate to win!
- That's right!

863
01:06:13,897 --> 01:06:15,544
They play very well.

864
01:06:23,452 --> 01:06:27,250
[Gary's ddakji just grazed the center]

865
01:06:27,511 --> 01:06:29,536
He just barely missed the center.

866
01:06:33,917 --> 01:06:34,984
[Ha Ha fail]

867
01:06:34,984 --> 01:06:37,594
I did not realize that ddakji
could be so much fun.

868
01:06:43,591 --> 01:06:45,136
That was so close!

869
01:06:47,275 --> 01:06:49,281
It was so close!

870
01:06:56,329 --> 01:06:59,311
The ddakji's condition also plays
a large role in this game.

871
01:07:08,072 --> 01:07:10,056
They've won the match!

872
01:07:12,642 --> 01:07:17,892
Kyonggi University collects an unexpected
win and will move on to the semi-finals!

873
01:07:23,281 --> 01:07:25,084
That's right.

874
01:07:27,697 --> 01:07:30,854
Incheon University, who was expected to win,
drops out of the race in the quarter-finals.

875
01:07:30,854 --> 01:07:33,778
We truly thought Incheon University
would win!

876
01:07:36,206 --> 01:07:41,310
Next! We have
Koryo University and Junbuk University!

877
01:07:50,939 --> 01:07:54,435
This is a battle between
Koryo University and Junbuk University.

878
01:07:57,861 --> 01:08:01,059
[Both teams are prepared for their match.]

879
01:08:01,537 --> 01:08:03,222
The first player for each team,
please step towards the center.

880
01:08:09,452 --> 01:08:14,591
I really wanted to die when I lost
twice in a row earlier.

881
01:08:14,591 --> 01:08:16,862
- You wanted to die?
- I sure did!

882
01:08:21,916 --> 01:08:24,424
The ddakjis are considerably
thin for both teams.

883
01:08:26,306 --> 01:08:30,254
Because of that,
it's difficult to flip over the ddakji

884
01:08:30,255 --> 01:08:34,202
but also difficult for the ddakji
itself to flip over.

885
01:08:34,203 --> 01:08:38,395
Because it's stuck to the ground,
hitting the center is that much more important.

886
01:08:46,868 --> 01:08:50,058
[Min Kyu win!]

887
01:08:53,665 --> 01:08:56,706
[Contrasting reactions]

888
01:09:04,300 --> 01:09:06,802
Junbuk University stand up!

889
01:09:06,802 --> 01:09:10,259
He is the ace on the team.
The ace of Junbuk University.

890
01:09:14,615 --> 01:09:18,091
Lee Kwang Soo is now up.

891
01:09:19,177 --> 01:09:21,688
Lee Kwang Soo will go first for this team.

892
01:09:22,807 --> 01:09:27,094
Junbuk University is another team
expected to win.

893
01:09:31,816 --> 01:09:36,136
[Flipped over... almost!]

894
01:09:38,125 --> 01:09:40,825
[Thank goodness]

895
01:09:46,543 --> 01:09:50,321
As you can see,
this person has played before.

896
01:09:50,967 --> 01:09:54,763
And that pose can be most effective
for this type of match.

897
01:10:00,977 --> 01:10:07,732
While the cheering can be encouraging, it can
also put a lot of pressure on you when playing.

898
01:10:07,732 --> 01:10:10,931
[What?]

899
01:10:10,931 --> 01:10:13,270
He looked at the ddakji and
then hit next to it.

900
01:10:17,370 --> 01:10:19,464
Kwang Soo is going barefoot.
He is taking his socks off.

901
01:10:21,352 --> 01:10:24,267
Giraffe will now play barefoot.

902
01:10:27,666 --> 01:10:33,048
With each passing round, he is
slowly taking off another layer of clothing.

903
01:10:35,062 --> 01:10:36,681
His posture was good.

904
01:10:36,681 --> 01:10:40,233
As we said before,
the ddakji is noticeably flat...

905
01:10:40,233 --> 01:10:43,780
[This time he slams down on it
while standing]

906
01:10:45,494 --> 01:10:49,092
[Jae Hyun wins!]

907
01:10:53,994 --> 01:10:56,366
[Junbuk leads 2:0]

908
01:10:56,366 --> 01:10:59,600
He hit that one right in the middle.

909
01:11:01,663 --> 01:11:05,936
It is now Ji Suk Jin against Joey,
our foreign friend.

910
01:11:20,930 --> 01:11:22,996
[Joey is their last hope]

911
01:11:22,996 --> 01:11:25,888
[Will Suk Jin be able to close out the match?]

912
01:11:28,249 --> 01:11:30,754
[Desperate]

913
01:11:40,622 --> 01:11:45,298
Joey! He flipped it over on the first try!

914
01:11:45,298 --> 01:11:53,814
Koryo just turned the tide of the game.

915
01:12:02,888 --> 01:12:06,989
Koryo University has suddenly
come to life!

916
01:12:06,989 --> 01:12:11,629
Back to the beginning.

917
01:12:12,855 --> 01:12:15,551
This is the team's ace.

918
01:12:16,670 --> 01:12:22,634
If he loses here...

919
01:12:45,486 --> 01:12:48,654
[Min Kyu wins!]

920
01:12:48,654 --> 01:12:51,187
[Even before he got to show off his skills.]

921
01:12:55,123 --> 01:12:57,558
[A warm round of applause to
Koryo University for all their hard work.]

922
01:12:57,558 --> 01:13:00,505
[Junbuk officially in the semi-finals]

923
01:13:11,027 --> 01:13:13,791
[Quarter-finals complete]

924
01:13:13,791 --> 01:13:21,009
Junbuk University defeats Koryo University
and enters the semi-finals.

925
01:13:25,014 --> 01:13:28,735
We are now in the semi-finals!

926
01:13:28,735 --> 01:13:34,022
Chungbuk University versus Kyonggi University.

927
01:13:43,871 --> 01:13:45,565
There are not very many options.

928
01:13:45,565 --> 01:13:48,880
Yoo Jae Suk was formerly
the ddakji king.

929
01:13:49,863 --> 01:13:54,038
This is Yoo Jae Suk's chance to shine!

930
01:13:56,205 --> 01:13:59,511
[His chance to use his muscles.]

931
01:14:08,434 --> 01:14:11,555
His power can be felt in that last strike.

932
01:14:14,314 --> 01:14:17,212
Next we have the volleyball player.

933
01:14:22,916 --> 01:14:26,390
He's stepped back.

934
01:14:26,390 --> 01:14:29,722
He has another chance!

935
01:14:35,593 --> 01:14:42,019
[The intense match]

936
01:15:00,540 --> 01:15:05,741
He flipped it over!
He flipped it over!

937
01:15:08,006 --> 01:15:11,046
[Return of the ddakji king]

938
01:15:15,096 --> 01:15:18,768
Yoo Jae Suk's smile has now
returned to his face.

939
01:15:18,768 --> 01:15:21,667
He is now smiling once again.

940
01:15:31,331 --> 01:15:33,995
Gary is another strong player.

941
01:15:43,677 --> 01:15:47,436
[Gary flips it over in one try]

942
01:15:47,436 --> 01:15:50,546
- That brings the score 1:1 now!
- Unbelievable!

943
01:15:55,644 --> 01:15:57,958
[Tied once again in a matter of moments.]

944
01:16:11,442 --> 01:16:14,159
[Each swing makes the heart race
a little bit quicker.]

945
01:16:15,741 --> 01:16:18,651
- This is another strong player.
- He is a strong player.

946
01:16:22,297 --> 01:16:24,755
That's right! That's it!

947
01:16:29,979 --> 01:16:33,901
Kyungbuk takes the lead once again!

948
01:16:40,175 --> 01:16:43,121
There's nowhere for us to go anyway.
Relax.

949
01:16:51,476 --> 01:16:54,471
[Oh...?!]

950
01:16:54,471 --> 01:16:59,508
It spun around twice!

951
01:17:03,469 --> 01:17:06,172
- It's not easy to make it spin twice.
- It is definitely no easy feat.

952
01:17:06,172 --> 01:17:10,380
And it is Yoo Jae Suk's turn once again.

953
01:17:15,382 --> 01:17:17,490
Typically when you hear that type of noise,
it is the sound of the ddakji flipping over.

954
01:17:20,972 --> 01:17:23,734
Will the team be able to defend this...

955
01:17:27,537 --> 01:17:29,168
[No way!]

956
01:17:30,938 --> 01:17:34,741
[Back to square one]

957
01:17:34,741 --> 01:17:39,120
Everyone is left speechless.

958
01:17:39,434 --> 01:17:41,104
Everyone, applause!

959
01:17:46,068 --> 01:17:48,021
[Shin Hong Kyu versus Gary]

960
01:17:48,021 --> 01:17:51,578
Kang Gary versus Shing Hong Kyu.

961
01:17:53,281 --> 01:17:55,599
[To crush him or let him off easy?]

962
01:18:03,018 --> 01:18:05,646
Everyone is wondering who will win.

963
01:18:12,419 --> 01:18:14,962
[Hong Kyu has not been
able to hit the ddakji.]

964
01:18:18,785 --> 01:18:22,437
[Hong Kyu wins.]

965
01:18:32,507 --> 01:18:36,274
[Advancement into finals.]

966
01:18:36,274 --> 01:18:38,180
This is so moving.

967
01:18:38,180 --> 01:18:40,201
This is really entertaining.

968
01:18:40,739 --> 01:18:43,970
He hit the ddakji. He wins.

969
01:18:43,970 --> 01:18:46,942
This is really entertaining.

970
01:18:46,942 --> 01:18:50,511
This ddakji competition has
the fervor of the World Cup.

971
01:18:50,511 --> 01:18:51,873
This is amazing.

972
01:18:51,873 --> 01:18:55,325
Finally, Gangwon University...

973
01:18:55,325 --> 01:18:57,870
[Gangwon University is up for the first time.]

974
01:18:57,870 --> 01:19:03,948
[First Running Man Nationwide
University Ddakji Competition]

975
01:19:03,948 --> 01:19:08,656
Junbuk University
versus Gangwon University!

976
01:19:11,632 --> 01:19:17,217
You may already be aware, but this
is the candidate most likely to win.

977
01:19:17,217 --> 01:19:20,277
- He is a champion.
- That's right.

978
01:19:21,522 --> 01:19:23,900
He's the strongest candidate to win.

979
01:19:23,900 --> 01:19:32,121
You saw earlier, but Junbuk University
has two especially strong students.

980
01:19:32,635 --> 01:19:37,292
Junbuk University has begun.

981
01:19:39,247 --> 01:19:46,102
But you don't necessarily
win because of strength.

982
01:19:46,102 --> 01:19:53,090
Physically they are stronger
and have quite a few advantages.

983
01:19:54,227 --> 01:19:57,493
[Bae Jae Hyun versus Han Joo Hyun]

984
01:19:57,493 --> 01:19:59,841
It's powerful...

985
01:19:59,841 --> 01:20:01,463
but you also have to be accurate.

986
01:20:01,463 --> 01:20:03,174
You have to be accurate.

987
01:20:03,174 --> 01:20:06,608
[Player Joo Hyun attacks.]

988
01:20:06,608 --> 01:20:07,983
[Goofing around.]

989
01:20:11,779 --> 01:20:14,781
[Succeeds in first try.]

990
01:20:14,781 --> 01:20:16,989
That was amazing.

991
01:20:18,110 --> 01:20:23,550
[This is the power of the strongest player.]

992
01:20:23,550 --> 01:20:27,625
- One try!
- He gets it in one try!

993
01:20:27,625 --> 01:20:31,221
Okay, now...

994
01:20:33,410 --> 01:20:39,815
Gangwon University gets through
the preliminary round.

995
01:20:39,815 --> 01:20:42,267
They get it in one try.

996
01:20:44,058 --> 01:20:47,845
[Choi Min Kyu versus Choi Tae Jin]

997
01:20:47,845 --> 01:20:51,104
Now it's Junbuk University’s turn.

998
01:20:51,503 --> 01:20:54,125
Better to be accurate than too ambitious.

999
01:20:55,452 --> 01:20:59,188
There you go. Be comfortable,
be comfortable.

1000
01:20:59,188 --> 01:21:01,937
Do it your way. Do it comfortably.

1001
01:21:01,937 --> 01:21:04,255
Be comfortable.
It's going over, it's going over.

1002
01:21:05,959 --> 01:21:07,915
He's very lucky.

1003
01:21:07,915 --> 01:21:11,873
He's very lucky. Overflowing with
strength. He must be nervous.

1004
01:21:11,873 --> 01:21:16,733
As we get deeper into the competition,
the passion in the arena gets stronger.

1005

[Min Kyu's second attack.]

1006
01:21:20,712 --> 01:21:22,620
[Fail.]

1007
01:21:22,620 --> 01:21:25,580
Should have been more accurate.

1008
01:21:25,580 --> 01:21:29,371
It'll flip. Do it your way.
Be comfortable.

1009
01:21:29,371 --> 01:21:31,037
Here we go.

1010
01:21:34,725 --> 01:21:38,123
[Easily succeeds.]

1011
01:21:38,123 --> 01:21:41,678
Is this how it ends?
[Two flips in a row.]

1012
01:21:43,508 --> 01:21:47,478
This is really unbelievable.

1013
01:21:47,478 --> 01:21:53,916
Even the other university students
can't seem to believe it.

1014
01:21:55,596 --> 01:22:00,905
The fate of the team is in
Suk Jin's hands.

1015
01:22:02,528 --> 01:22:05,854
Rock, paper, scissors.
Rock, paper, scissors.

1016
01:22:05,854 --> 01:22:09,100
Ah, he lost his chance.
[But Kim Jong Kook wins.]

1017
01:22:09,100 --> 01:22:10,751
Such a shame.

1018
01:22:11,311 --> 01:22:13,401
Ah, he lost.

1019
01:22:13,869 --> 01:22:17,510
Running Man's Kim Jong Kook.

1020
01:22:17,510 --> 01:22:20,244
It'll be a victory for the self.

1021
01:22:20,244 --> 01:22:25,219
The record is pretty flawless so far.

1022
01:22:26,750 --> 01:22:28,139
Suddenly, the audience...

1023
01:22:28,139 --> 01:22:33,172
Yoon Eun Hye!

1024
01:22:33,172 --> 01:22:37,407
They are chanting Yoon Eun Hye's name.

1025
01:22:37,407 --> 01:22:39,345
Why is everyone doing this?

1026
01:22:39,345 --> 01:22:46,725
This is a very effective tactic.

1027
01:22:48,875 --> 01:22:50,694
It was effective.

1028
01:22:50,694 --> 01:22:53,058
It's Ji Suk Jin's chance.

1029
01:22:55,734 --> 01:22:57,582
Suk Jin has to do this.

1030
01:22:57,582 --> 01:22:59,498
Here's his chance.

1031
01:23:07,381 --> 01:23:09,756
Ji Suk Jin's chance.

1032
01:23:09,756 --> 01:23:14,714
[No one's expecting much.]

1033
01:23:14,714 --> 01:23:20,385
[But today I'm going all the way.]

1034
01:23:24,198 --> 01:23:26,721
That was a bit weak.

1035
01:23:27,753 --> 01:23:31,447
[Chanting Yoon Eun Hye again.]

1036
01:23:32,899 --> 01:23:36,691
The Yoon Eun Hye chant
seems to have an effect.

1037
01:23:39,246 --> 01:23:44,432
[If I can't do it this time,
it's over for me.]

1038
01:23:47,446 --> 01:23:50,559
What's going on?

1039
01:23:53,682 --> 01:23:57,432
What's going on?

1040
01:23:57,432 --> 01:24:01,751
[The tiger has lost to Impala.]

1041
01:24:03,630 --> 01:24:07,183
[Suk Jin's miracle.]

1042
01:24:07,439 --> 01:24:12,304
He's done it!
He's done it!

1043
01:24:12,711 --> 01:24:16,794
This is something none of us expected.

1044
01:24:16,794 --> 01:24:18,366
This is amusing.

1045
01:24:18,366 --> 01:24:21,153
[First players are up again.]

1046
01:24:21,153 --> 01:24:23,377
This is really unbelievable.

1047
01:24:25,254 --> 01:24:27,559
Junbuk University's player...

1048
01:24:27,559 --> 01:24:28,771
there he goes.

1049
01:24:31,652 --> 01:24:33,865
Here he goes.

1050
01:24:35,475 --> 01:24:38,749
Hey. Be accurate, be accurate.

1051
01:24:39,472 --> 01:24:43,178
What is this?

1052
01:24:43,178 --> 01:24:45,155
What is going on?

1053
01:24:45,155 --> 01:24:48,807
What is this?

1054
01:24:48,807 --> 01:24:56,408
[The never-ending miracle.]

1055
01:24:56,408 --> 01:24:58,630
What is going on?

1056
01:24:58,630 --> 01:25:00,752
What is this?

1057
01:25:02,278 --> 01:25:07,020
Didn't I tell you? The competition
isn't over until it's over.

1058
01:25:07,814 --> 01:25:11,581
It's not over until it's over.
This is amazing.

1059
01:25:12,118 --> 01:25:19,386
Okay next round. Junbuk University
is getting ready. The cheers are amazing.

1060
01:25:24,100 --> 01:25:27,178
Who knew ddakji could be this fun?

1061
01:25:27,178 --> 01:25:29,547
This is why we can't stop playing.

1062
01:25:29,547 --> 01:25:31,190
This is why we can't stop playing ddakji.

1063
01:25:32,368 --> 01:25:35,028
[Min Kyu wins.]

1064
01:25:36,350 --> 01:25:40,879
The two come to the center.
Who will win?

1065
01:25:40,879 --> 01:25:43,391
One team will advance.

1066
01:25:43,391 --> 01:25:46,246
The team got through thanks to Suk Jin.

1067
01:25:54,164 --> 01:25:57,112
A lot of strength went into that.
He's shaking.

1068
01:25:57,688 --> 01:26:00,618
I didn't know it'd be this nerve-wracking.

1069
01:26:02,466 --> 01:26:05,869
The Junbuk player was
probably very nervous.

1070
01:26:06,401 --> 01:26:08,260
At ease.

1071
01:26:13,974 --> 01:26:17,027
The ddakji has divided into four parts.

1072
01:26:17,027 --> 01:26:18,574
It's broken into four parts.

1073
01:26:18,574 --> 01:26:21,078
That's how hard they're working.

1074
01:26:21,410 --> 01:26:24,561
Yes, the ddakji has exploded.

1075
01:26:24,561 --> 01:26:26,618
The second round.

1076
01:26:26,618 --> 01:26:28,518
[Min Kyu's second attack.]

1077
01:26:34,135 --> 01:26:38,355
[It flipped!]

1078
01:26:40,424 --> 01:26:41,929
[A come-from-behind victory!]

1079
01:26:41,929 --> 01:26:45,781
They came from behind to win!

1080
01:26:50,342 --> 01:26:53,203
They came from behind to win!

1081
01:26:53,203 --> 01:26:57,601
Junbuk University!

1082
01:27:00,847 --> 01:27:04,051
[Junbuk University
advances to next round.]

1083
01:27:05,951 --> 01:27:10,469
Ji Suk Jin. In four years,
he finally won something!

1084
01:27:17,114 --> 01:27:21,731
I don't know how to say this,
but the eternal victor failed.

1085
01:27:21,731 --> 01:27:22,731
It's like Brazil getting eliminated.

1086
01:27:25,706 --> 01:27:28,165
The players gave it their all.

1087
01:27:28,165 --> 01:27:32,530
Because of Yoon Eun Hye,
Kim Jong Kook fell apart.

1088
01:27:32,530 --> 01:27:35,626
Kim Jong Kook was the turning point.

1089
01:27:35,626 --> 01:27:39,855
It was all thanks
to the audience cheering.

1090
01:27:43,599 --> 01:27:48,300
[The finals.]

1091
01:27:48,300 --> 01:27:56,529
[Junbuk University versus
Chungbuk University.]

1092
01:27:58,047 --> 01:28:01,324
[Jung Ji Wook: speed of lightning.]

1093
01:28:03,351 --> 01:28:06,489
[Shin Hong Kyu: ddakji genius.]

1094
01:28:06,489 --> 01:28:08,799
It was an amazing victory.

1095
01:28:09,116 --> 01:28:12,562
[Yoo Jae Suk: legendary ddakji master.]

1096
01:28:17,833 --> 01:28:19,696
Kang Gary.

1097
01:28:19,696 --> 01:28:23,341
[Choi Min Kyu: special ace.]

1098
01:28:26,970 --> 01:28:30,605
[Ji Suk Jin: miracle maker.]

1099
01:28:33,709 --> 01:28:37,490
[Bae Jae Hyun: the terminator.]

1100
01:28:43,759 --> 01:28:46,705
[Only one team will win.]

1101
01:28:47,629 --> 01:28:49,214
[Will it be Chungbuk University?]

1102
01:28:49,214 --> 01:28:50,775
It's good we got this far.

1103
01:28:51,839 --> 01:28:53,097
[Or miracle Junbuk University?]

1104
01:28:53,097 --> 01:28:56,088
If we can't win this, it's over.

1105
01:29:02,279 --> 01:29:05,311
[Choi Min Kyu versus Jung Ji Wook.]

1106
01:29:06,343 --> 01:29:09,318
[Min Kyu wins!]

1107
01:29:14,354 --> 01:29:18,152
[Palpable nerves.]

1108
01:29:19,795 --> 01:29:21,619
Kang Gary fighting!

1109
01:29:25,432 --> 01:29:28,653
[He goes for it.]

1110
01:29:34,551 --> 01:29:36,806
You have to be accurate.

1111
01:29:36,806 --> 01:29:39,202
[Ji Wook's turn.]

1112
01:29:46,284 --> 01:29:48,762
[Fail.]

1113
01:29:53,362 --> 01:29:56,437
[Increasingly passionate cheers.]

1114
01:29:57,629 --> 01:30:01,430
Will strength win over speed?

1115
01:30:11,067 --> 01:30:14,359
[Success! Choi Min Kyu can do it.]

1116
01:30:21,819 --> 01:30:24,805
[Power trumps speed.]

1117
01:30:29,372 --> 01:30:33,147
[Ji Suk versus Shin Hong Kyu.]

1118
01:30:37,145 --> 01:30:39,187
[Ji Suk wins.]

1119
01:30:41,054 --> 01:30:45,044
[Will Ji Suk's miracle streak continue?]

1120
01:30:50,043 --> 01:30:52,112
Will Suk Jin flip it?

1121
01:30:56,949 --> 01:31:01,132
[Miracle Suk Jin's success!]

1122
01:31:04,054 --> 01:31:09,807
How is this possible? How?

1123
01:31:09,807 --> 01:31:11,873
Miracle.

1124
01:31:12,804 --> 01:31:21,452
[Chungbuk University puts
all their faith in Jae Suk.]

1125
01:31:30,638 --> 01:31:34,728
[Will the king of ddakji be able
to rescue Chungbuk University?]

1126
01:31:37,199 --> 01:31:39,904
[The ddakji doesn't even move.]

1127
01:31:42,479 --> 01:31:44,830
[Terminator Jae Hyun's attack.]

1128
01:31:51,777 --> 01:31:57,791
He has a very unique way
of attacking by kneeling.

1129
01:31:57,791 --> 01:31:59,832
Yoo Jae Suk tries again.

1130
01:32:01,212 --> 01:32:03,818
A lot of effort went into that.

1131
01:32:03,818 --> 01:32:05,632
Next player up.

1132
01:32:06,783 --> 01:32:10,622
Will the ddakji move for this player?

1133
01:32:10,622 --> 01:32:13,174
Here we go.

1134
01:32:13,174 --> 01:32:14,691
Will it be a clean sweep 3:0?

1135
01:32:14,691 --> 01:32:19,768
[This turn might determine everything.]

1136
01:32:26,424 --> 01:32:28,532
[Jae Hyun fail.]

1137
01:32:31,611 --> 01:32:34,549
[Jae Suk's turn again.]

1138
01:32:39,952 --> 01:32:43,928
[Jae Suk success!]

1139
01:32:47,844 --> 01:32:50,489
The god of ddakji.

1140
01:32:57,820 --> 01:33:01,131
- My failure...
- Your turn is over. Forget it.

1141
01:33:01,131 --> 01:33:05,191
- Come from behind!
- Come from behind!

1142
01:33:05,191 --> 01:33:06,901
[Ji Wook's attack.]

1143
01:33:09,507 --> 01:33:12,592
It was a good effort.

1144
01:33:12,592 --> 01:33:15,269
The ddakji doesn't move as much for them.

1145
01:33:17,061 --> 01:33:21,497
Will he be able to close this?
Min Kyu is the ace.

1146
01:33:27,389 --> 01:33:31,344
[Ji Wook has a chance to win.]

1147
01:33:34,184 --> 01:33:36,113
[Ji Wook fails.]

1148
01:33:45,127 --> 01:33:48,629
[Ddakji turns twice before falling.]

1149
01:33:48,629 --> 01:33:51,031
Needs to be more accurate.

1150
01:33:58,862 --> 01:34:02,107
[A bit lacking in strength.]

1151
01:34:06,108 --> 01:34:08,959
[Again, ddakji turns twice before falling.]

1152
01:34:08,959 --> 01:34:11,624
This is drying up our blood.

1153
01:34:11,624 --> 01:34:13,960
It certainly is.

1154
01:34:13,960 --> 01:34:15,818
I feel bad for them.

1155
01:34:15,818 --> 01:34:18,752
Suk Jin brings on the next round.

1156
01:34:20,827 --> 01:34:23,761
Let's see how this goes.

1157
01:34:23,761 --> 01:34:25,757
How will it turn out?
Will he do it?

1158
01:34:31,067 --> 01:34:36,242
Min Kyu can end it all right here.

1159
01:34:36,242 --> 01:34:37,651
This is his chance.

1160
01:34:38,157 --> 01:34:40,754
Here he goes.

1161
01:34:45,690 --> 01:34:48,487
[It flipped!]

1162
01:34:59,070 --> 01:35:03,529
[Junbuk University Winners!]

1163
01:35:06,811 --> 01:35:11,240
[Ji Suk started the miracle.]

1164
01:35:11,240 --> 01:35:17,834
[Junbuk University finished the miracle.]

1165
01:35:19,967 --> 01:35:24,439
[The First Running Man Nationwide
University Ddakji Competition.]

1166
01:35:24,439 --> 01:35:29,287
Junbuk University wins!

1167
01:35:29,287 --> 01:35:32,523
The team Ji Suk Jin led!

1168
01:35:34,009 --> 01:35:39,315
- Today is Ji Suk Jin's day!
- It certainly is.

1169
01:35:39,315 --> 01:35:41,491
It's all for Ji Suk Jin.

1170
01:35:41,491 --> 01:35:45,258
Everyone, please give him
a round of applause.

1171
01:35:45,258 --> 01:35:50,241
This is really an extraordinary feat.

1172
01:35:50,757 --> 01:35:57,452
We'd like to thank everyone
for spending this time with us.

1173
01:35:57,452 --> 01:36:01,819
The Running Man scholarship goes
to Junbuk University.

1174
01:36:03,560 --> 01:36:08,099
I had a feeling we might win,
but I didn't think we really would.

1175
01:36:08,099 --> 01:36:14,980
I am so moved that I could
help them in getting this scholarship.

1176
01:36:14,980 --> 01:36:19,287
Also, our Min Kyu and Jae Hyun
and everyone who came.

1177
01:36:19,287 --> 01:36:22,192
I sincerely thank you.
I love you. Thank you!

1178
01:36:22,993 --> 01:36:24,716
Fighting!

1179
01:36:24,716 --> 01:36:27,238
This goes down in Running Man history.

1180
01:36:27,238 --> 01:36:35,463
It's been four years since Suk Jin
has led a team to victory. A historical feat.

1181
01:36:35,463 --> 01:36:38,404
Let's give Suk Jin a round of applause.

1182
01:36:40,661 --> 01:36:43,588
You never know when the next
ddakji competition will come up.

1183
01:36:43,588 --> 01:36:47,036
To all our students and all our viewers

1184
01:36:47,036 --> 01:36:49,775
hold on. We'll come to you again soon.

1185
01:36:49,775 --> 01:36:53,325
The first Running Man ddakji
competition ends here. Thank you!

1186
01:36:57,934 --> 01:36:59,880
You all worked hard.

1187
01:37:02,429 --> 01:37:04,327
You did well.

1188
