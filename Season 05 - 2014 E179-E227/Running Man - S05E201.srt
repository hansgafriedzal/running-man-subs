00:08:43,216 --> 00:08:45,191
Be careful getting out.

161
00:08:45,192 --> 00:08:47,715
- Here we go again.
- So it's that season again, isn't it?

162
00:08:48,213 --> 00:08:53,110
[What is the first battle that
awaits them on this muddy field?]

163
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,134
Do we have to get our feet wet?

164
00:08:55,995 --> 00:09:00,245
[The farm field has been transformed
into a muddy flat.]

165
00:09:02,993 --> 00:09:06,829
[Even just entering the field
is a difficult feat for these city idols.]

166
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:08,934
You guys are newbies to
the muddy flats, aren't you?

167
00:09:11,436 --> 00:09:14,671
We're out on this field every single year.

168
00:09:14,672 --> 00:09:17,749
- This is no big deal.
- Maybe it was last summer...

169
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:22,278
But GD came on our show,
and we even made that sweet kid swear.

170
00:09:22,279 --> 00:09:24,934
[GD got to experience the real meaning
of muddy farm field last summer.]

171
00:09:24,935 --> 00:09:25,964
It was really bad last year.

172
00:09:25,965 --> 00:09:27,170
GD laughed a lot that day

173
00:09:27,171 --> 00:09:29,194
but he was laughing because
he couldn't believe the absurdity of it all.

174
00:09:29,195 --> 00:09:32,086
It wasn't because he was having fun,
but because he couldn't believe the absurdity.

175
00:09:32,707 --> 00:09:36,198
- Is this a first time experience for anyone?
- This is my first time being out here.

176
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:38,393
Then is this even going to be a
match for us?

177
00:09:38,428 --> 00:09:41,731
You're going to end up gargling
with the muddy farm field water.

178
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:48,130
But in the case of Jin Young and Hoya
with their hair right now...

179
00:09:48,131 --> 00:09:50,607
your new hair color is going to be
a beautiful shade of mud.

180
00:09:52,214 --> 00:09:55,584
- Look at how we're dressed right now.
- We've all got a towel covering our heads.

181
00:09:55,585 --> 00:09:57,525
Remember when GD used to have
that silver hair color?

182
00:09:57,526 --> 00:09:59,258
His hair color was from being out here.

183
00:09:59,259 --> 00:10:01,807
[GD's mud flat hairstyle.]

184
00:10:01,808 --> 00:10:06,652
The first mission between the
City Idol and Rural Idol is

185
00:10:06,653 --> 00:10:08,373
the battle of physical stamina.

186
00:10:08,374 --> 00:10:10,173
[City idol vs Rural idol- First mission.
Battle of physical stamina.]

187
00:10:10,731 --> 00:10:14,009
[Pampered city idols' response of dread.]

188
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:16,414
- You don't seem very confident?
- No, I feel very confident!

189
00:10:16,415 --> 00:10:19,322
- Min Ho's the only one excited about this.
- I feel very confident!

190
00:10:19,323 --> 00:10:21,274
- This is a tough first battle to open with.
- Min Ho's always confident.

191
00:10:21,275 --> 00:10:24,708
- What's poor Sung Gyu going to do?
- I've been working out lately.

192
00:10:24,709 --> 00:10:28,112
- I've been working out lately.
- Sung Gyu's been doing cross fit fitness.

193
00:10:28,113 --> 00:10:31,284
- How long have you been doing it for?
- Two months, I mean, one month.

194
00:10:32,801 --> 00:10:36,434
You should've been doing it for the past year.
A month isn't going to be good enough.

195
00:10:36,435 --> 00:10:40,209
He actually lives in the same building as me,
and he's rumored to be a table tennis maniac.

196
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:43,288
- Table tennis?
- You just stay quiet.

197
00:10:44,278 --> 00:10:45,830
You just stay quiet.

198
00:10:46,176 --> 00:10:48,932
[You just stay quiet.
I'm trying to look after you.]

199
00:10:48,933 --> 00:10:51,104
He was trying to look after you just now.

200
00:10:51,105 --> 00:10:53,179
If you're going to look after him,
then do a better job of doing it.

201
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:55,161
If I feed you a line,
you should learn how to accept it.

202
00:10:55,162 --> 00:10:57,634
Then you should do a better job
of feeding me better lines.

203
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:04,201
[The two teams' fierce battle of the wits.]

204
00:11:04,202 --> 00:11:06,476
Before we get started on the mission

205
00:11:06,477 --> 00:11:08,699
we have prepared a light game
that will help us get started.

206
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:10,818
This game is called, 'Human rice building'.

207
00:11:10,819 --> 00:11:13,029
- Do you all see the starting flag?
- Yes.

208
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:14,924
The runners will all run towards the flag

209
00:11:14,925 --> 00:11:19,178
and all the members will create a hurdle
with your own bodies

210
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:21,007
for your team members to hop over.

211
00:11:21,008 --> 00:11:26,317
Winning will be determined by how well you
form your hurdles for the jumper on your team.

212
00:11:26,318 --> 00:11:29,122
So the team that makes it back across
the starting line first

213
00:11:29,123 --> 00:11:31,320
will be given a great advantage
which will benefit the whole team.

214
00:11:31,743 --> 00:11:33,783
Who's going to be the jumper on our team?

215
00:11:33,784 --> 00:11:36,200
- Why don't we have Gary do it?
- Me?

216
00:11:36,201 --> 00:11:38,346
- Gary's fast.
- Okay, we'll have Gary do it.

217
00:11:38,347 --> 00:11:41,200
But how about we have Kwang Soo do it
since you have to be able to jump high?

218
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:43,292
- Yes, I think Kwang Soo will be better.
- Okay, then Kwang Soo can do it.

219
00:11:43,293 --> 00:11:46,456
[Giant Kwang Soo is chosen
to be the jumper on their team.]

220
00:11:50,922 --> 00:11:52,997
[Competitive Min Ho's eager demonstration.]

221
00:11:53,828 --> 00:11:55,576
We can do that too!

222
00:11:55,577 --> 00:11:58,437
[Fine, let's see you try!]

223
00:12:02,423 --> 00:12:05,285
[Giraffe demonstrates with his whole body.]

224
00:12:08,116 --> 00:12:10,969
[Their mental battle is proving fierce
right from the start of the game.]

225
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:12,245
Don't let your feet sink into the mud.

226
00:12:17,763 --> 00:12:21,006
[Big-nose alone demonstrates the beauty
of slapstick comedy.]

227
00:12:21,968 --> 00:12:25,711
I've already told you that the winning team
will be given a great advantage.

228
00:12:25,712 --> 00:12:27,914
- Yes.
- Okay, everyone get ready.

229
00:13:05,026 --> 00:13:07,658
[On the other hand, Rural Idols falter
from the start with the Blank Ji hurdle.]

230
00:13:13,322 --> 00:13:16,473
[Impala hurdle isn't able to endure
the weight of the jumping Giraffe.]

231
00:13:17,596 --> 00:13:20,573
[Kwang-Toad has already become
the Mud-Toad after only three hurdles.]

232
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:25,544
[This time, Yoo Hyuk hurdle
proves to be too high for him.]

233
00:13:34,859 --> 00:13:40,244
[Faulty hurdles... and even faultier jumper.]

234
00:13:41,383 --> 00:13:44,595
[On the other hand, Min Ho forges on
at a speed equivalent to being on dry land.]

235
00:13:53,743 --> 00:13:56,859
[City idol already grabs their flag
with an amazing gap in the lead.]

236
00:13:59,013 --> 00:14:02,272
[Kwang Soo on the other hand is fighting
a lone battle with the muddy waters.]

237
00:14:02,273 --> 00:14:04,667
This isn't even a game!

238
00:14:04,668 --> 00:14:06,713
[Even his own team members are
berating him for his poor skills.]

239
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:12,273
[Falls back down as if being pulled
to the mud by a magnetic force.]

240
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:15,636
Kwang Soo, your pants are falling off!

241
00:14:15,637 --> 00:14:18,209
[Kwang-Toad shedding his skin.]

242
00:14:19,952 --> 00:14:22,472
Laughter is good and all,
but we still have to play the game too!

243
00:14:22,473 --> 00:14:24,489
[Even if he tried to catch up now...]

244
00:14:25,956 --> 00:14:28,941
[City Idols win with ease.]

245
00:14:30,422 --> 00:14:34,739
[Rural Idols lose face
on their own home ground.]

246
00:14:35,844 --> 00:14:40,212
- Can we do another round of something else?
- How about a relay race?

247
00:14:40,636 --> 00:14:42,375
- Relay race?
- Yes, let's do a relay race.

248
00:14:43,678 --> 00:14:48,537
[Members of Rural Idol Team are suggesting
another round of a different game.]

249
00:14:48,538 --> 00:14:50,778
How about a round of name tag elimination?

250
00:14:50,779 --> 00:14:52,970
But we just won this game!

251
00:14:53,549 --> 00:14:56,394
- We just won!
- Hear us out for a minute.

252
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:59,220
Okay, fine. We'll accept your proposal since
we're probably going to win this too anyway.

253
00:14:59,255 --> 00:15:01,776
- Okay!
- That's our Bora!

254
00:15:01,777 --> 00:15:04,259
- That's so cool of her!
- Why are you choosing for us?

255
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:08,171
Just look at the condition they're in!

256
00:15:10,352 --> 00:15:11,989
- Our condition?
- What's wrong with the condition we're in?

257
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:16,956
[Sorry guys!]

258
00:15:16,957 --> 00:15:19,980
- When is Suk Jin going to go?
- Why are you asking that? You gunning for me?

259
00:15:19,981 --> 00:15:22,482
- So that he can go up against Chan Sung.
- I'll go third.

260
00:15:22,483 --> 00:15:24,990
- What about you, Ha Ha?
- When is Sung Gyu going to go?

261
00:15:24,991 --> 00:15:27,013
- I'm going fourth.
- Come up to the first.

262
00:15:27,014 --> 00:15:30,217
Min Ho, Kwang Soo says he wants to
go up against you again.

263
00:15:30,218 --> 00:15:33,839
- Seriously, Kwang Soo!
- I'll bet my whole fortune!

264
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:36,625
Kwang Soo,
I'll bet my whole fortune on it too.

265
00:15:36,626 --> 00:15:38,738
- Okay, good!
- Kwang Soo has nothing but debt.

266
00:15:39,242 --> 00:15:41,287
I'm going to pass all my debts
over to you.

267
00:15:44,381 --> 00:15:49,307
Okay, here are the rules.
The runner has to go around the flag

268
00:15:49,308 --> 00:15:52,652
- and there will be no throwing of the flags.
- Okay, we understand.

269
00:15:52,653 --> 00:15:54,670
Especially, no running without a baton
will be allowed whatsoever.

270
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:57,299
- Gary, did you hear that?
- Yes, I know that!

271
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:59,192
Do you think that I'm stupid or something?

272
00:15:59,689 --> 00:16:03,063
- You think I'll actually do that again?
- It's still so vivid in my mind.

273
00:16:03,621 --> 00:16:05,414
Okay, is everyone ready?

274
00:16:05,415 --> 00:16:07,442
- I'm going to do this for real.
- I'm doing this for real.

275
00:16:07,443 --> 00:16:08,689
Ready!

[No!]

279
00:16:25,047 --> 00:16:26,782
[What do you mean, no?]

280
00:16:26,783 --> 00:16:30,077
[Quite the gap between the two.]

281
00:16:35,441 --> 00:16:38,377
[Rural Idol Team's second runner, Gary,
gets on his way.]

282

starts off soon thereafter.]

Jin Young!

285
00:17:01,599 --> 00:17:03,865
[Jin Young finally finds
both his balance and his feet.]

286
00:17:06,169 --> 00:17:10,953
[Rural Idol Team's third runner, Big-nose.]

287

the moment the baton touches his hand.]

thanks to Big-nose Brother's faltering.]

closes the gap in the blink of an eye.]

291

Old Big-nose has nothing on him.]

292

[Chan Sung succeeds in taking over the lead.]

293
00:17:46,499 --> 00:17:48,228
What are you doing?

294
00:17:51,321 --> 00:17:54,111
[City Idol Team's fourth runner,
Min Hyuk, receives the baton.]

295
00:17:54,112 --> 00:17:55,835
What are you doing, Suk Jin!

296
00:17:56,222 --> 00:17:58,519
[Rural Idol Team's fourth runner,
Jae Suk, finally receives the baton.]

297
00:18:03,887 --> 00:18:06,661
[City Idol Team is already onto
their fifth runner, Bora.]

298
00:18:07,468 --> 00:18:09,472
[Bora runs fast enough to have
the hat flying off of her head.]

299
00:18:13,437 --> 00:18:14,810
Hurry!

300
00:18:17,393 --> 00:18:20,116
[Runners still waiting for their turn are
getting frustrated with their teammates.]

301
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:23,592
[Is there some honey slathered onto
the bottom of the muddy field?]

302

[In the meantime, Bora is already making
her way around the halfway point.]

303
00:18:28,547 --> 00:18:31,252

is already about to round the halfway point.]

[City Idol Team's sixth runner, Hoya,
starts off with ease in his steps.]

become the outcome for the entire team.]

318
00:19:40,416 --> 00:19:44,974
[A race with both of the runners'
entire fortunes on the line.]

319
00:19:46,986 --> 00:19:50,666
[Neck and neck!
They both round the flag simultaneously.]

320
00:19:58,053 --> 00:20:01,034
[Competitive Min Ho vs. Kwang-Toad.]

321
00:20:03,033 --> 00:20:05,910
[Both cross the line almost simultaneously.]

322
00:20:12,656 --> 00:20:16,311
[City Idol Team wins by one single step.]

323
00:20:18,353 --> 00:20:23,647
[City Idol Team's second win in a row
on Rural Idol Team's home ground.]

324
00:20:26,187 --> 00:20:29,962
City Idol Team has won both rounds of
the preliminary games.

325
00:20:29,963 --> 00:20:31,646
As I've mentioned before

326
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:35,210
the winning team of the preliminary game will
be given a huge advantage for their use.

327
00:20:35,211 --> 00:20:37,539
And here's the advantage
that they've just won.

328
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:39,483
It's the chance to disqualify

329
00:20:39,484 --> 00:20:43,970
one member on the opposing team
from participating in the actual game.

330
00:20:45,219 --> 00:20:47,602
[One guess as to who
that person is going to be.]

331
00:20:50,877 --> 00:20:53,811
Don't you think that you should've
told us that before we started the game?

332
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:57,843
Since this is a variety show and all...

333
00:20:57,844 --> 00:20:59,585
We were trying to be
considerate to the girls.

334
00:20:59,586 --> 00:21:02,619
Had we known this was going to happen,
we could've done a much better job.

335
00:21:02,951 --> 00:21:05,914
We could've definitely won if
we didn't have Suk Jin on our team.

336
00:21:07,066 --> 00:21:08,582
What did you just say?

337
00:21:08,583 --> 00:21:12,621
- But you proposed this in the first place.
- But you still should've told us first.

338
00:21:12,622 --> 00:21:16,657
You can't tell us to disqualify a member.
No, I can't do that!

339
00:21:19,731 --> 00:21:22,947
[Muddy face washing of rage!]

340
00:21:27,233 --> 00:21:28,646
What are you trying to do to us right now!

341
00:21:28,647 --> 00:21:31,374
[An unbelievable amount of dedication
in the name of winning the race.]

342
00:21:36,398 --> 00:21:38,719
- He said dunk your face, and we can do it.
- Do what?

343
00:21:39,724 --> 00:21:42,784
[Tiger is also given a muddy face wash.]

344
00:21:42,944 --> 00:21:44,822
Just dunk your face in.

345
00:21:44,823 --> 00:21:49,597
But since rules are still rules,
as long as City Idols are okay with it

346
00:21:49,598 --> 00:21:53,157
we can allow Ji Hyo to be the one to stay out
of the game since this is a strenuous game.

347
00:21:53,158 --> 00:21:57,795
- We can allow Ji Hyo to sit this one out.
- In that case, how about Suk Jin instead?

348
00:21:59,785 --> 00:22:03,359
- Yes, I'm not in the best health.
- But Suk Jin is our best winning card.

349
00:22:04,368 --> 00:22:06,849
I'd like to see Jong Kook dunk his
head in just one more time.

350
00:22:06,850 --> 00:22:09,111
- If he does...
- But I already did it!

351
00:22:11,859 --> 00:22:13,763
I'll dunk him a hundred times
if that's what you want me to do.

352
00:22:13,764 --> 00:22:16,338
- Let's show them what we can do.
- Let's show them!

353
00:22:16,339 --> 00:22:18,519
[City Idol Team uses their advantage to
disqualify Blank Ji from participating.]

354
00:22:19,018 --> 00:22:21,592
I've never seen Jong Kook get
humiliated like that before!

355
00:22:21,593 --> 00:22:23,652
I will make you regret ever
having angered me.

356
00:22:25,373 --> 00:22:27,194
Okay, here's the first round of
the real official games.

357
00:22:28,686 --> 00:22:30,800
The game will be played in the same method
as you played the strength battle.

358
00:22:30,801 --> 00:22:33,322
But the only difference is, once
you've pushed everyone off the platform

359
00:22:33,323 --> 00:22:38,335
you have to place the weaved basket on your
opposing team's side in order to win the game.

360
00:22:38,654 --> 00:22:41,955
The weaved baskets will be holding
your snacks later on.

361
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:43,891
- Are you all hungry?
- Yes, we're hungry.

362
00:22:43,892 --> 00:22:47,735
All the snacks will be put into
the winning team's weaved basket.

363
00:22:50,607 --> 00:22:56,410
Hoya, Jin Young and Sung Gyu cannot be left
to go back home with their current hair color.

364
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,641
We're not going to go easy on you guys.

365
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:02,818
[Dye their hair in the color
of this muddy water?]

366
00:23:02,963 --> 00:23:06,342
- Sung Gyu, what are you doing?
- Just dunk your hands in there!

367
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:08,068
I was just trying to see.

368
00:23:11,931 --> 00:23:14,785
[Gets his hair dyed before
the game even starts.]

369
00:23:17,889 --> 00:23:21,107
[Did Chan Sung just push me in the water?]

370
00:23:21,108 --> 00:23:23,875
[Half disbelief, and half rage-
Sung Gyu bursts out in laughter.]

371
00:23:23,876 --> 00:23:25,954
If he wasn't my senior...

372
00:23:26,585 --> 00:23:28,905
[If only he wasn't his senior...]

373
00:23:29,602 --> 00:23:32,364
[Sung Gyu definitely has a flair
for the variety show.]

374
00:23:32,365 --> 00:23:35,661
Okay, time to start the game!
Ready, set, go!

375
00:23:35,922 --> 00:23:38,679
[Muddy farm field battle of strength- Go!]

376
00:23:39,667 --> 00:23:42,809
[Tiger proposes a battle of one on one.]

377
00:23:44,631 --> 00:23:46,704
You want to try, don't you, Jin Young?

378
00:23:46,705 --> 00:23:49,008
- I think he wants to try.
- Jin Young.

379
00:23:49,702 --> 00:23:51,682
[Me?]

380
00:23:54,689 --> 00:23:57,367
I've always been curious as to how strong
he really is from having seen him on TV.

381
00:23:57,872 --> 00:24:01,443
[City boy, Jin Young, is curious to find out
the full extent of the Tiger's power.]

382
00:24:03,516 --> 00:24:05,106
Just come at me right now.

383
00:24:12,397 --> 00:24:15,878
[Is this what Jin Young is really like?]

384
00:24:16,779 --> 00:24:20,161
[City boy, Jin Young, shows off
some real slapstick comedy.]

385
00:24:20,937 --> 00:24:22,279
I'm embarrassed for you.

386
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:25,645
[Jin Young's ability to bring about laughter
is as big as the level of his curiosity.]

387
00:24:26,102 --> 00:24:28,425
- That was funny.
- Sung Gyu, want to give it a try?

388
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:30,326
- With you?
- Yeah.

389
00:24:30,327 --> 00:24:32,246
- Okay, let's do it.
- You said you were going to pick Chan Sung.

390
00:24:32,247 --> 00:24:33,938
Chan Sung is too much for me.

391
00:24:35,232 --> 00:24:37,039
I'm not going to be that easy either.

392
00:24:38,123 --> 00:24:40,880
- Look at how bright he looks.
- What did you say that you're doing lately?

393
00:24:40,881 --> 00:24:43,238
[A fierce battle of mental games
while warming up their bodies.]

394
00:24:43,239 --> 00:24:45,482
Suk Jin's been working out lately too.

395
00:24:52,127 --> 00:24:54,551
- Show him what you can do, Suk Jin.
- Show him your strength, Suk Jin.

396
00:24:57,874 --> 00:24:59,307
You're still pretty lively.

397
00:25:00,175 --> 00:25:03,502
Am I a grandfather?
What do you mean, I'm still pretty lively?

398
00:25:05,499 --> 00:25:06,997
No, he's still very lively.

399
00:25:06,998 --> 00:25:08,844
What is he saying right now?

400
00:25:10,671 --> 00:25:13,159
- Suk Jin is very lively.
- I can't believe he said that.

401
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:15,877
He won't have any problems with this.
See if you can take him down.

402
00:25:17,068 --> 00:25:18,894
He's only old enough to be your father.

403
00:25:18,895 --> 00:25:23,324
[Sung Gyu bulldozes on.]

404
00:25:23,325 --> 00:25:26,749
[Big-nose withstands to counterattack.]

405
00:25:28,383 --> 00:25:30,048
- Flip him over.
- Sung Gyu!

406
00:25:34,901 --> 00:25:38,199
[Lively Big-nose throws Sung Gyu
off the platform.]

407
00:25:40,113 --> 00:25:45,439
[This is Running Man's weakest link,
Big-nose's power!]

408
00:25:46,946 --> 00:25:50,011
[Come and get me!]

409
00:25:50,743 --> 00:25:52,876
[How can this be...]

410
00:25:53,394 --> 00:25:56,108
- How could you have let that happen?
- I'm in shock right now myself.

411
00:25:56,109 --> 00:25:57,797
I had no idea that I'd lose.

412
00:25:57,798 --> 00:25:59,815
[I had no idea that I'd lose...]

413
00:26:01,158 --> 00:26:04,286
You have to be careful of Gary,
and just get rid of Ha Ha and Kwang Soo.

414
00:26:04,287 --> 00:26:07,996
- Watch out for Gary and Jong Kook.
- You have no idea how strong Kwang Soo is.

415
00:26:09,103 --> 00:26:10,837
Kwang Soo is really strong.

416
00:26:12,904 --> 00:26:14,515
You have no idea how strong Kwang Soo is.

417
00:26:20,452 --> 00:26:23,383
[Kwang Soo steps off the platform to
hand Ji Hyo the weaved basket.]

418
00:26:27,095 --> 00:26:30,113
[City Idol Team adamantly argues
that Kwang Soo is out of the game.]

419
00:26:30,591 --> 00:26:32,268
Lee Kwang Soo, out!

420
00:26:36,306 --> 00:26:41,420
[No matter what the case, he's out of the game
from having stepped off the platform.]

421
00:26:43,098 --> 00:26:47,435
[The weakest elimination in the
history of this game.]

422
00:26:48,074 --> 00:26:51,615
[I just wanted to have both my hands free
to fight against the other team.]

423
00:26:52,866 --> 00:26:54,861
You guys, watch out for Suk Jin!

424
00:26:59,437 --> 00:27:01,152
What are you doing, Suk Jin?

425
00:27:01,153 --> 00:27:03,200
- I've got something in my sock.
- That's not what's important right now!

426
00:27:03,201 --> 00:27:04,669
But it hurts!

427
00:27:04,670 --> 00:27:07,254
[Old Big-nose... always very unpredictable.]

428
00:27:10,303 --> 00:27:13,900
[A fierce battle position.]

429
00:27:14,634 --> 00:27:16,438
Are you guys that scared?

430
00:27:19,615 --> 00:27:23,269
[City Idol Team initiates the attack.]

431
00:27:23,270 --> 00:27:26,777
[But Rural Idol Team
is not to be messed with!]

432
00:27:35,506 --> 00:27:38,065
[Min Hyuk- Out!]

433
00:27:46,766 --> 00:27:49,778

are eliminated in the blink of an eye.]

the human pile.]

436

[But his team members don't have the courage
to rescue him and only retreat.]

437
00:28:04,576 --> 00:28:05,838
He's still down there!

438
00:28:07,212 --> 00:28:09,989
I can't stretch my legs like that!

439
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:12,013
- That really hurts!
- Then give up, Chan Sung.

440
00:28:12,014 --> 00:28:14,651
[Chan Sung screams out in pain
from his awkward position.]

441
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:24,891
[Bora grabs the Tiger by his hair
in an attempt to save Chan Sung.]

442
00:28:27,432 --> 00:28:31,283
[City Idol Team's Joan of Arc, Bora.]

443
00:28:31,284 --> 00:28:33,134
[Tiger is knocked out.]

444
00:28:35,534 --> 00:28:38,270

and Haroro in her left.]

450
00:29:12,492 --> 00:29:15,698
[Joan of Arc,
Bora's pivotal role in the game.]

451
00:29:20,069 --> 00:29:21,359
Let's just go down together.

452
00:29:25,159 --> 00:29:28,620
[Min Ho and Jae Suk are
ousted simultaneously.]

453
00:29:29,942 --> 00:29:33,009

after having given it her best shot.]

[Mud farm field battle of strength-
Rural Idol Team wins.]

456
00:29:44,414 --> 00:29:46,560

when it comes to this game.

457
00:29:46,561 --> 00:29:48,663

through this muddy game.]

458

for Rural Idol Team for winning the game.]

459

You cannot share your snacks
with the team that lost the game.

460
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:02,021
That's really too bad.
They played really hard too.

461
00:30:04,574 --> 00:30:06,903
How do you open this thing?
Seriously!

462
00:30:08,027 --> 00:30:09,261
No, I got it.

463
00:30:11,202 --> 00:30:12,254
I said, I got it.

464
00:30:12,255 --> 00:30:14,344
Right of choice!

465
00:30:15,568 --> 00:30:17,490
Although I don't know what this is for,
I'm just going to be happy about it.

466
00:30:18,634 --> 00:30:23,299
[Big-nose Brother is still battling
it out with his drink bottle.]

467
00:30:23,934 --> 00:30:26,020
I think it means that
we get first choice of something.

468
00:30:26,021 --> 00:30:30,877
[Big-nose Brother must've been very thirsty.]

469

Who doesn't have any sunscreen on?

471
00:30:39,172 --> 00:30:41,274
- But the sun's already gone down.
- But you still need to put some on.

472
00:30:41,275 --> 00:30:42,898
You burn more when the sun is like this.

473
00:30:42,899 --> 00:30:44,535
- It's in a mousse form.
- Wow.

474
00:30:44,536 --> 00:30:47,638
- This has a cooling sensation.
- Can you put some on me yourself?

475
00:30:47,639 --> 00:30:50,300
- Where? Let me see.
- I'll put it on for you.

476

[Cheesy Min Ho steps forward.]

477

- You're grossing me out. I didn't mean you.
- I'll do it. I can put some on you.

478
00:31:00,212 --> 00:31:02,233
I was told to put it onto your skin.

479
00:31:02,234 --> 00:31:03,891
But this really does have
a cooling sensation, doesn't it?

480
00:31:04,148 --> 00:31:07,889
But when it comes to strength based
battle like that...

481
00:31:07,890 --> 00:31:09,634
How can we ever beat them when they've
got Jong Kook on their team?

482
00:31:09,635 --> 00:31:13,348
- We actually did do pretty good.
- Yes, we did.

483
00:31:13,349 --> 00:31:16,575
But there's one person on our team
who's our main cause of defeat.

484
00:31:16,576 --> 00:31:20,052
- Who, it's not Bora.
- No, it's Sung Gyu!

485
00:31:20,053 --> 00:31:21,648
I see something over there.

486
00:31:21,649 --> 00:31:24,118
[Arrives at their second location
for Idol Experience Training Race.]

487
00:31:24,119 --> 00:31:25,378
Is this an amusement park?

488
00:31:25,379 --> 00:31:29,855
More than anything else, Jing Young
and Min Hyuk look so happy right now.

489
00:31:29,856 --> 00:31:32,255
The expression on both their faces are
so different than what they were before.

490
00:31:32,256 --> 00:31:35,176
- Jin Young, you were seriously so funny.
- What do you think of Jong Kook now?

491
00:31:35,177 --> 00:31:37,205
Someone told me recently

492
00:31:37,206 --> 00:31:39,758
that Jong Kook is actually pretty small
when you see him in person.

493
00:31:39,759 --> 00:31:42,259
- Who told you that?
- Just someone I know.

494
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:44,164
If you say who that person is,
then that person is going to end up dead.

495
00:31:44,484 --> 00:31:46,414
Don't ever tell who that person is.
Just take that information to the grave!

496
00:31:46,415 --> 00:31:48,109
[Keeping the identity a secret is a must!]

497
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:51,332
- That person really would be dead.
- My body is actually pretty slim.

498
00:31:51,333 --> 00:31:53,326
[Look at him closely,
and he's actually quite slim?]

499
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:56,423
If you follow this path
and go over the hill you'll come across

500
00:31:56,424 --> 00:31:58,430
five different adventure courses.

501
00:31:58,431 --> 00:32:02,374
You can go and pick and choose which of
the five courses you'd like to do on your own.

502
00:32:02,375 --> 00:32:04,595
Once you complete the course
you've chosen

503
00:32:04,596 --> 00:32:07,119
then you'll get a special stamp on your hand
to verify that you've completed the course.

504
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:11,012
You need to collect three stamps as a team
to win this mission.

505
00:32:11,013 --> 00:32:13,165
If you feel that you can't do a certain one,
then you're allowed to leave that course.

506
00:32:13,166 --> 00:32:14,597
- Is that understood?
- Okay.

507
00:32:14,598 --> 00:32:16,831
[I will make sure to win this time!]

508
00:32:17,142 --> 00:32:22,442
[Idol Experience Training Race's Big Five.]

509
00:32:24,233 --> 00:32:28,115
[Rural Idol Team's method is to separate
into two teams to divide and conquer.]

510
00:32:28,810 --> 00:32:32,431
[Only one stamp is given out for any given
course, so only one team can win that course.]

511
00:32:34,446 --> 00:32:36,007
Should we give it a try?

512
00:32:36,381 --> 00:32:39,051
[One of the courses is discovered.]

513
00:32:43,512 --> 00:32:44,651
What's this?

514
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:45,954
<i>[Water dipper experience.]</i>

515
00:32:45,955 --> 00:32:47,807
- Scoop up the water to wash the dishes?
- What is this?

516
00:32:47,842 --> 00:32:51,186
What you see to your right is a tool called,
'Yong-Durae' (Water dipper).

517
00:32:51,187 --> 00:32:56,636
It's a tool used to irrigate the water from
low level ground to high level ground.

518
00:32:57,239 --> 00:32:58,901
The dishes that you see in front of you

519
00:32:58,901 --> 00:33:01,808
got very muddy because a lady from town fell
while bringing back your snack dishes.

520
00:33:02,410 --> 00:33:04,968
No, this looks like you guys swished it around
in a huge puddle of dirt and mud.

521
00:33:04,969 --> 00:33:08,098
What are you talking about?
This looks like you guys purposely did this.

522
00:33:08,099 --> 00:33:11,493
This course is for you to use this
water dipping tool

523
00:33:11,494 --> 00:33:13,285
to help out with the washing
of these dishes.

524
00:33:13,286 --> 00:33:15,596
Once all the dishes are clean,
you'll find something written on the dishes.

525
00:33:15,597 --> 00:33:20,653
If you configure the letters around,
you'll find either a six letter word

526
00:33:20,654 --> 00:33:22,743
or an eight letter word from
these two pile of dishes.

527
00:33:22,744 --> 00:33:24,884
[First team to figure out the word by washing
the dishes first wins this course.]

528
00:33:24,884 --> 00:33:26,716
- We have to hurry.
- Set, go!

529
00:33:26,717 --> 00:33:28,629
[Letter puzzle- Start.]

530
00:33:29,868 --> 00:33:31,658
[Huh?]

531
00:33:31,659 --> 00:33:32,944
This is hard.

532
00:33:34,282 --> 00:33:36,979
[But why is the water splashing backwards?]

533
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:39,739
[The farming tools are so foreign
to these city idol boys.]

534
00:33:45,967 --> 00:33:48,282
[Rural Idol members, on the other hand,
show off their real strength.]

535
00:33:51,227 --> 00:33:52,809
Just accept the water shower.

536
00:33:54,275 --> 00:33:57,017
[Are they washing dishes,
or giving Ha Ha a bath?]

537
00:34:01,069 --> 00:34:03,966
- No, we have to really scoop it out.
- That's how we need to do it.

538
00:34:07,706 --> 00:34:09,750
Wait, that's really cold.

539
00:34:09,751 --> 00:34:11,440
One, two, three.

540
00:34:14,155 --> 00:34:17,881
[Didn't they all just recently
shower and get cleaned off?]

541
00:34:23,747 --> 00:34:26,406
We need more water over here.
We need more water in our tub.

542
00:34:26,407 --> 00:34:27,632
[Just as soaked as he was
during their previous mission.]

543
00:34:27,633 --> 00:34:29,406
- Nothing?
- No, nothing.

544
00:34:29,873 --> 00:34:31,898
Look at me.
What is this?

545
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:35,578
Why am I being made to do this again
when I just got cleaned off after the field?

546
00:34:35,939 --> 00:34:39,092
How many pairs of underwear
do I need to start traveling with?

547
00:34:39,769 --> 00:34:41,517
But this is clean water.

548
00:34:41,518 --> 00:34:43,490
I just had to buy my last pair
from the convenience store.

549
00:34:43,491 --> 00:34:45,019
Seriously.

[City Idol Team has perfected
a method of their own.]

551
00:34:51,671 --> 00:34:54,941
[They need to find a letter written
on some of these dishes.]

552
00:34:54,942 --> 00:34:56,479
Do you see a letter?

553
00:34:57,311 --> 00:34:59,672
- Look on the inside of the dish.
- I see a letter right here.

554
00:34:59,673 --> 00:35:02,386
- What is it?
- It's 'Ri'.

555
00:35:02,387 --> 00:35:04,543
Grab another dish.

556
00:35:09,681 --> 00:35:11,662
You have to catch the water with the dish.

557
00:35:12,117 --> 00:35:14,237
- You're the one who's not doing this right.
- Hurry up and grab the dish.

558
00:35:14,238 --> 00:35:16,432
- Switch. Switch spots with me.
- You're not doing this right.

559
00:35:16,433 --> 00:35:18,965
- Flip the dish over.
- No, switch spots with me.

560
00:35:19,963 --> 00:35:22,137
- No, I found it! I found a letter!
- What is it?

[Ru]

[The more letters they can find,
the easier it'll be to figure out the word.]

- I found it!
- What is it?

565
00:35:36,662 --> 00:35:38,014
'Al'.

566
00:35:39,078 --> 00:35:40,853
- 'Ru' and 'Al'.
- 'Ru' and 'Al'?

567

Al-Ru?

- Nice!

- What do you think of this one?
- What the heck is that?

573
00:36:05,707 --> 00:36:07,619
This is the black goat experience course.

574
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:10,963
The caretaker has asked us to attach
the name tags on the goats

575
00:36:10,964 --> 00:36:14,149
because they have a natural tendency
to run off from where they're supposed to be.

576
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:17,797
Please name four of the goats,
and put these name tags on those goats.

577

[Put name tags around the necks of
four of the goats in the pen.]

- Are they nice?
- Is there a way to call them over to you?

579
00:36:21,998 --> 00:36:24,664
- Feed them the grass they like.
- Oh, feed them some grass?

580
00:36:24,665 --> 00:36:25,905
[Lure the goats over by offering them
some grass for them to eat.]

581
00:36:25,906 --> 00:36:28,013
What should we name them?

582
00:36:28,014 --> 00:36:29,804
Since there are four of us here,
let's name them after each one of us.

583
00:36:29,805 --> 00:36:32,272
No, that's a great idea.
Let's just name them after us.

584
00:36:32,906 --> 00:36:34,441

- Why are they running away from us?

593

catch their goats...]

603

- We have to dig up 500g of ginseng.
- There's ginseng in this field?

604

- How much is 500g?
- Is there really ginseng out on this field?

605
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:40,431
- Does it have to be exactly 500g?
- 500g or more.

606
00:37:40,804 --> 00:37:44,478
If it's 500g...
Two chicken breasts weigh 400g.

607
00:37:44,479 --> 00:37:46,977
Why do you compare everything
to chicken breasts?

608
00:37:48,236 --> 00:37:50,095
Wow, this definitely is a form of exercise.
I can feel my muscles working.

609
00:37:50,096 --> 00:37:52,196
Jong Kook, are you actually happy
about this?

610

Wow, I'm getting a workout.

611
00:37:53,932 --> 00:37:56,961
If I had a servant like Jong Kook,
then my life would be so much easier.

612
00:37:57,518 --> 00:38:01,064
Why don't Jong Kook and Kwang Soo keep
digging with a hoe in each hand?

613
00:38:01,065 --> 00:38:03,638
If you grab one in each hand

614
00:38:04,134 --> 00:38:07,684
and drag it down the field like this
to create a couple of rows...

615

Ji Hyo, you're not by any chance
thinking that I'm an ox, are you?

Jong Kook, you can definitely do
the work of an ox.

to their next course location.]

654
00:40:16,297 --> 00:40:19,827

below to get these pigs out of the wind.

tied around their legs?

- Wow, that's amazing.
- I have to find one too.

744
00:45:46,924 --> 00:45:50,154
There's a reason why the other team gave up.
How in the world are we going to find ten?

745

00:49:21,372 --> 00:49:23,182
But it's too windy up here.

805
00:49:23,773 --> 00:49:27,858
[In the meantime, Rural Idols are working
together to move their last two pigs.]

806
00:49:29,390 --> 00:49:32,304
[At this rate, Rural Idols may lose again...]

807
00:49:33,077 --> 00:49:35,691
[The goal is to move seven.
Rural Idols succeed in moving six of seven.]

808
00:49:36,219 --> 00:49:38,241
[Chan Sung barely succeeds in grabbing
two pigs at once.]

809
00:49:38,242 --> 00:49:41,859
[Both teams just need to get their
last cargo into the pen...]

810
00:49:45,066 --> 00:49:48,338
[Kkuk succeeds in moving
the final baby pig into the pen.]

811
00:49:51,472 --> 00:49:55,216
[Pig pen course- Rural Idols wins the stamp.]

812
00:49:58,036 --> 00:50:00,749
[Completely exhausted.]

813
00:50:01,073 --> 00:50:02,381
Guys.

814
00:50:02,382 --> 00:50:04,055
This is a safer place for you guys.

815
00:50:04,479 --> 00:50:06,946
- That's right, you guys.
- You guys could've caught a cold up there.

816
00:50:06,947 --> 00:50:09,403
- We rescued you guys from getting sick.
- That's right.

817
00:50:09,404 --> 00:50:12,115
- See? You've got lots of food here.
- And this pen is much bigger too.

818
00:50:13,193 --> 00:50:15,233
That was my first time catching pigs.

819
00:50:15,234 --> 00:50:17,680
[Still bewildered from his
first encounter with the pigs.]

820
00:50:18,021 --> 00:50:20,728
- If I grabbed one just a little quicker.
- You guys worked really hard back there.

821
00:50:23,796 --> 00:50:25,874
- Chan Sung.
- Chan Sung.

822
00:50:25,875 --> 00:50:28,039
[Pig daddy is still exhausted from having
moved five of the seven pigs.]

823
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:30,636
[Three stamps is the goal,
and Rural Idols succeeded in getting two.]

824
00:50:42,258 --> 00:50:45,038
[After having failed the pig catching,
this team comes over to catch the loaches.]

825
00:50:46,341 --> 00:50:47,670
We have to catch something again?

826
00:50:52,636 --> 00:50:56,259
[Even though they keep losing,
their persistence is still very commendable.]

827
00:50:58,360 --> 00:51:03,427
[Another first of catching loaches.]

828
00:51:08,349 --> 00:51:10,088
Chan Sung, you've never
done this before, have you?

829
00:51:11,388 --> 00:51:14,409
You all grew up so delicately like
an indoor plant in the city.

830
00:51:15,417 --> 00:51:18,318
First, you have to corner the loaches.

831
00:51:18,319 --> 00:51:20,380
[Yoo Hyuk acts like he know what he's doing
and gives them a lesson on how to catch.]

832
00:51:20,381 --> 00:51:22,597
You have to corner them by
swishing your feet around like this.

833
00:51:22,819 --> 00:51:24,955
[Demonstrates how loach catching is done.]

834
00:51:29,042 --> 00:51:30,049
See?

835
00:51:31,055 --> 00:51:32,471
I just caught two.

836
00:51:32,746 --> 00:51:34,262
Here, give them to me.

837
00:51:34,263 --> 00:51:36,242
No, I was just showing you how to do it.

838
00:51:36,243 --> 00:51:37,723
[Steals the loaches that Jae Suk just caught.]

839
00:51:39,634 --> 00:51:43,832
Professional loach catchers
never rush.

840
00:51:46,128 --> 00:51:50,380
- I think I just caught one.
- Here's another one right here.

841
00:51:53,306 --> 00:51:54,808
I don't think you caught any.
No, you didn't catch any.

842
00:51:58,189 --> 00:52:01,707
[Mr. Gary, who seems to fit right in
at this muddy field...]

843
00:52:01,708 --> 00:52:03,623
[A whole basket full!]

844
00:52:04,226 --> 00:52:05,653
Can I weigh them to see
how much I've got so far?

845
00:52:09,689 --> 00:52:12,425
- What's the weight so far?
- We need to catch like 20 more.

846
00:52:12,426 --> 00:52:16,037
[All those loaches still only weighs 500g,
and their goal is to catch 1k worth.]

847
00:52:17,536 --> 00:52:21,174
Ha Ha, go to the local supermarket
and buy us a couple of mackerels.

848
00:52:21,841 --> 00:52:24,191
We can try to pass them off as loaches.

849
00:52:24,192 --> 00:52:27,129
[When are they ever going to catch
a whole 20k worth of loaches?]

850
00:52:27,130 --> 00:52:30,378
Ugh, seriously. How are
we ever going to catch them all?

851
00:52:30,379 --> 00:52:32,682
- Guys.
- Yes?

852
00:52:32,683 --> 00:52:35,335
- You guys have to get this done.
- Why?

853
00:52:35,336 --> 00:52:37,773
- Aren't you going to go somewhere else?
- There's nowhere else to go.

854
00:52:37,774 --> 00:52:40,436
[No more courses for them to go to.]

855
00:52:40,437 --> 00:52:42,656
Ugh, seriously!

856
00:52:43,154 --> 00:52:45,919
Why don't you start from down here
instead of doing all that?

857
00:52:47,271 --> 00:52:49,027
Mister, are you the owner of
this muddy pond?

858
00:52:49,028 --> 00:52:52,138
- I know how to catch loaches.
- Let's keep up the good work!

859
00:52:52,139 --> 00:52:55,734
- Start from way down here.
- We're professional loach catchers.

860
00:52:56,574 --> 00:53:00,940
How about one of you hold onto the basket
and another person push them in there?

861
00:53:00,941 --> 00:53:04,187
[One is telling them to do this,
and another is telling them to do another.]

862
00:53:05,592 --> 00:53:07,891
Who the heck are you, Mister?

863
00:53:08,342 --> 00:53:11,609
- I'm someone who knows how to catch them.
- You guys are all over the place without me.

864
00:53:11,610 --> 00:53:13,767
- Ugh, seriously.
- Do I need to coach you on how to do it?

865
00:53:13,768 --> 00:53:16,463
- Do you need me to guide you?
- Seriously.

866
00:53:16,464 --> 00:53:19,948
- Just listen to what I'm telling you.
- Just stick in one place and dig.

867
00:53:20,234 --> 00:53:22,632
One of you can corner them,
and Jae Suk wait there with your basket.

868
00:53:23,651 --> 00:53:26,331
[They end up doing
as Big-nose tells them to do.]

869
00:53:28,674 --> 00:53:31,525
[There you go!]

870
00:53:35,923 --> 00:53:37,759
[I don't see any?]

871
00:53:40,841 --> 00:53:42,077
Jae Suk.

872
00:53:42,450 --> 00:53:44,685
Why don't you just stop?

873
00:53:44,686 --> 00:53:47,350
- No way.
- Yeah, we got it all.

874
00:53:47,351 --> 00:53:50,165
- We got it all.
- What the heck!

875
00:53:50,166 --> 00:53:52,575
- We already got two stamps.
- We got it done a while ago.

876
00:53:52,576 --> 00:53:54,726
[They were just playing with them
after having completed the whole mission?]

877
00:53:54,727 --> 00:53:56,861
It was nice to see you guys
working so hard.

878
00:53:59,673 --> 00:54:03,483
[Completely... bewildered.]

879
00:54:04,234 --> 00:54:06,792
You guys looked like you were having
so much fun catching the loaches.

880
00:54:07,465 --> 00:54:10,930
- Show them all your stamp marks.
- You guys are the best loach catchers.

881
00:54:10,931 --> 00:54:15,809
[Water digger, pig catching, and where else?]

882
00:54:17,549 --> 00:54:20,276
Come here, goats. We'll go
after we get these name tags on you.

883
00:54:20,277 --> 00:54:21,836
[It's the goat name tag course that
the city idols had previously abandoned!]

884
00:54:23,068 --> 00:54:26,177
[Calmly puts the name tag around
the necks of four goats.]

885
00:54:26,753 --> 00:54:30,492
- We really are good at this.
- There you go. You're all set.

886
00:54:30,493 --> 00:54:34,358
[Even goat, 'Blank Ji',
gets her name tag necklace.]

887
00:54:36,861 --> 00:54:39,061
It took us less than two minutes
to complete that course.

888
00:54:39,062 --> 00:54:41,197
- We cornered them all.
- You're kidding us, right?

889
00:54:41,198 --> 00:54:43,465
You have to hold them with
your hands.

890
00:54:44,476 --> 00:54:45,772
Use your heads.

891
00:54:45,773 --> 00:54:47,563
Did you do the whole course by yourself?

892
00:54:48,664 --> 00:54:50,514
[Seriously, Suk Jin...]

893
00:54:51,004 --> 00:54:52,979
Seriously, I can't listen to you anymore.
Did you do it all by yourself or something?

894
00:54:52,980 --> 00:54:54,617
How many goats did you get?

895
00:54:55,070 --> 00:54:56,355
Nothing.

896
00:55:01,853 --> 00:55:03,592
I helped corner them all.

897
00:55:04,558 --> 00:55:08,193
- You guys all tried so hard.
- You grew up too delicately in the city.

898
00:55:08,194 --> 00:55:10,420
This is the force of Running Man.

899
00:55:10,421 --> 00:55:12,664
Don't you think that we're at a disadvantage?
This is your home ground.

900
00:55:12,665 --> 00:55:15,938
- No, that's ridiculous.
- You know what Jin Young just said?

901
00:55:15,939 --> 00:55:19,126
You know what Jin Young just said?
He says this is our home ground.

902
00:55:19,127 --> 00:55:20,680
How is this our home ground?

903
00:55:20,681 --> 00:55:22,936
It's been years since we've been
out here too.

904
00:55:23,568 --> 00:55:25,394
I live in an apartment building too.

905
00:55:25,395 --> 00:55:27,187
What are you talking about?

906
00:55:28,965 --> 00:55:31,466
We only come out here from time to time
to film out show, but that's it.

907
00:55:31,967 --> 00:55:35,238
But all our families and relatives
live in the city too.

908
00:55:35,239 --> 00:55:38,024
Do you think that we actually
live out here or something?

909
00:55:38,025 --> 00:55:40,396
We all live in Seoul too.

910
00:55:40,397 --> 00:55:43,457
- What are you guys even saying?
- We just want you to experience what we do.

911
00:55:43,458 --> 00:55:45,602
- Really?
- Yes, like dancing and such.

912
00:55:46,877 --> 00:55:48,929
Then we'd definitely win those missions.

913
00:55:49,389 --> 00:55:51,990
[Who are you saying is going to
win the dance competition?]

914
00:55:53,751 --> 00:55:55,755
He used to be a backup dancer.

915
00:55:55,756 --> 00:55:58,395
I used to be a leader of
my backup dancer group.

916
00:55:58,823 --> 00:56:00,686
No, we're being serious.

917
00:56:00,687 --> 00:56:03,681
- I used to dance in H.O.T too.
- Gary too.

918
00:56:03,682 --> 00:56:06,042
[Even Gary is the king of dance from Jamsil.]

919
00:56:06,043 --> 00:56:08,158
Hang on, let me move over there.

920
00:56:09,509 --> 00:56:11,855
- That was a good move.
- I haven't done a glide in years.

921
00:56:11,856 --> 00:56:15,636
[Their battle of wits continues.]

922
00:56:16,029 --> 00:56:18,559
Team Running Man wins another mission.

923
00:56:18,905 --> 00:56:22,755
[Rural Experience Big Five-
Rural Idols wins another chance ticket.]

924
00:56:22,756 --> 00:56:24,772
Is it okay for us to keep winning like this?

925
00:56:24,773 --> 00:56:27,164
- What else can we do about it?
- No, there's nothing we can do about it.

926
00:56:27,165 --> 00:56:30,440
What can we do about it when we're
just too good and keep winning?

927
00:56:30,441 --> 00:56:32,328
If you're going to keep talking like that,
then just give us the chance ticket.

928
00:56:32,329 --> 00:56:34,508
But isn't it against the rules
to give away these tickets?

929
00:56:36,665 --> 00:56:38,723
We'll exchange four kilos of our potatoes
for one of your chance tickets.

930
00:56:38,724 --> 00:56:41,500
- Here, we'll swap you for it.
- You just enjoy these with Eun.

931
00:56:42,348 --> 00:56:44,838
You have no idea how much
she loves potatoes.

932
00:56:44,839 --> 00:56:47,900
- You just enjoy these potatoes with her.
- Will she be good with these?

933
00:56:48,694 --> 00:56:51,053
- Does she know how to cook potatoes?
- Yes, she does.

934
00:56:55,861 --> 00:56:59,464
[Second loss in a row-
Dejectedly heads off to their next location.]

935
00:57:00,728 --> 00:57:02,872
I really have nothing to say
about my lack of contribution.

936
00:57:04,111 --> 00:57:07,467
[Hoya is feeling anxious because he feels
that he still hasn't contributed much.]

937
00:57:07,468 --> 00:57:10,341
- I worked as best as I could.
- But I haven't really seen him do anything.

938
00:57:10,676 --> 00:57:12,330
But you're not doing all that bad.

939
00:57:13,183 --> 00:57:16,646
[City Idols have yet to win
a single chance ticket.]

940
00:57:16,647 --> 00:57:19,878
[They vow to win the next mission!]

941
00:57:20,722 --> 00:57:23,759
[An elementary school in Ganhwado.]

942
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:25,504
Hey, Chan Sung.

943
00:57:25,505 --> 00:57:27,101
You look really exhausted.

944
00:57:27,455 --> 00:57:29,651
- You really do look exhausted.
- You're looking really tired.

945
00:57:30,273 --> 00:57:33,223
Chan Sung looks really exhausted right now.

946
00:57:33,224 --> 00:57:35,786
- No? You're okay?
- No, I'm not tired at all.

947
00:57:37,133 --> 00:57:41,986
Of all the idols that Running Man members
have ever gone up against

948
00:57:41,987 --> 00:57:44,022
this group is the most sluggish of them all.

949
00:57:44,023 --> 00:57:45,753
[Weakest idols they've ever
been up against so far.]

950
00:57:45,754 --> 00:57:50,006
You know that there's only one more
chance ticket to be won, correct?

951
00:57:50,213 --> 00:57:53,575
If the Rural Idol Team takes all three tickets,
it would mean a huge difference in the game.

952
00:57:53,576 --> 00:57:56,551
We don't know what'll happen either.
That's what we talked about on our way here.

953
00:57:56,552 --> 00:57:59,145
We won't go easy on you at all.
We're a very merciless team.

954
00:57:59,146 --> 00:58:01,392
I had no idea that he was
so formidable like this.

955
00:58:01,393 --> 00:58:02,981
Formidable.

956
00:58:02,982 --> 00:58:06,929
- He just looked so weak on TV.
- Why are you saying it like that, Jin Young?

957
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:09,346
I believe that the process of how it's done
is more important that the actual outcome.

958
00:58:09,347 --> 00:58:12,079
But neither your process nor
the outcome has been very good so far.

959
00:58:13,109 --> 00:58:16,125
- One or the other has to be good.
- I have nothing to say to that.

960
00:58:17,211 --> 00:58:19,046
That's what I mean.

961
00:58:19,047 --> 00:58:22,545
This next mission will be to test
your abilities to work as a team.

962
00:58:22,546 --> 00:58:25,894
- When it comes to teamwork...
- Then Running Man is the best of them all.

963
00:58:25,929 --> 00:58:27,297
Your next mission.

964
00:58:27,298 --> 00:58:29,456
It's basketball name tag elimination.

965
00:58:29,457 --> 00:58:31,417
[Basketball name tag elimination.]

966
00:58:31,418 --> 00:58:33,245
I played basketball until
two in the morning last night.

967
00:58:33,246 --> 00:58:34,925
- Just put your faith in me.
- Do you know what Min Ho just said?

968
00:58:34,926 --> 00:58:37,287
He said he played basketball until
two in the morning last night.

969
00:58:37,737 --> 00:58:40,432
[Confidence from having played basketball
until the wee hours of the morning.]

970
00:58:40,730 --> 00:58:46,969
You must first find the basketballs which are
hidden in various spots throughout this place.

971
00:58:46,970 --> 00:58:49,086
- You have to find them first?
- I bet Min Ho's disappointed to hear that.

972
00:58:49,512 --> 00:58:51,914
He's disappointed to know that
it's not that kind of basketball.

973
00:58:51,915 --> 00:58:53,839
If you search all around you

974
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:56,052
you'll find mini basketball hoops
that are set up in various spots.

975
00:58:56,053 --> 00:58:58,803
You'll find them both on the inside
and outside of school.

976
00:58:58,804 --> 00:59:02,603
All fourteen of your names are on
individual basketball hoops.

977
00:59:03,289 --> 00:59:06,980
- Throw the basketball you find in the hoop...
- Then that person is ousted?

978
00:59:06,981 --> 00:59:09,072
Yes, then that person will be ousted.
You have to plan carefully.

979
00:59:09,073 --> 00:59:12,666
Even though it's important to throw the ball
you find into these basket hoops

980
00:59:12,667 --> 00:59:17,812
know that you can also steal the ball in
rebound and put it in your opponent's goal.

981
00:59:18,504 --> 00:59:20,442
Okay, this is a battle of rebounds.

982
00:59:21,579 --> 00:59:24,416
We have to come up with a plan first.

983
00:59:24,417 --> 00:59:26,897
Find out where our opponent's goals are
while we search for the balls

984
00:59:26,898 --> 00:59:30,147
and play defense to our own goals so that
they don't score on us and eliminate us.

985
00:59:30,148 --> 00:59:33,197
Let's keep each other updated on
where these goals are located.

986
00:59:33,198 --> 00:59:37,242
Since we need to defend our own goals too,
we have to eliminate our strongest opponents.

987
00:59:37,243 --> 00:59:38,693
[Eliminate their strongest opponents first.]

988
00:59:38,694 --> 00:59:41,107
- We can't let them steal our ball.
- And defend your own goal.

989
00:59:41,949 --> 00:59:43,603
This isn't going to be easy.

990
00:59:44,173 --> 00:59:47,055
Basketball name tag elimination... start!

991
00:59:47,306 --> 00:59:49,522
- Kwang Soo!
- Push them out of the way!

992
00:59:50,937 --> 00:59:53,116
- Where's Min Ho?
- He's behind us right now.

993
00:59:53,117 --> 00:59:55,237
[Off to find the balls and
the opponent's goal post.]

994
00:59:55,238 --> 00:59:57,026
Min Ho's climbing up two steps at a time.

995
00:59:57,964 --> 01:00:01,426
[The basketballs are hidden both inside
and outside of the school building.]

996
01:00:01,427 --> 01:00:03,360
The balls could be hidden all throughout
places like this, right?

997
01:00:03,818 --> 01:00:05,556
Where are all the balls?

998
01:00:07,590 --> 01:00:09,300
There's Gary's hoop over there.

999
01:00:12,344 --> 01:00:14,536
[Discovers Gary's hoop.]

1000
01:00:15,725 --> 01:00:18,661
Here's Sung Gyu's hoop.
We just need to find a ball to oust him.

1001
01:00:18,662 --> 01:00:21,380
[Discovers Sung Gyu's hoop
on the ground floor.]

1002
01:00:21,381 --> 01:00:22,793
- Sung Gyu.
- Sung Gyu? Okay.

1003
01:00:23,543 --> 01:00:26,792
[Important to remember where each
of their hoops are hidden.]

1004
01:00:28,076 --> 01:00:29,430
Who's that?
Who's name is up there?

1005
01:00:29,431 --> 01:00:32,144
- Who is it?
- Chan Sung and Kwang Soo.

1006
01:00:32,145 --> 01:00:35,002
[Right next to one another.]

1007
01:00:35,640 --> 01:00:39,320
[Blocking his own hoop like
a wall of bricks.]

1008
01:00:40,153 --> 01:00:42,069
If I were the ball,
where would I be hiding?

1009
01:00:43,791 --> 01:00:48,421
[Since they've found most of the hoops,
it's now time to seriously look for the balls.]

1010
01:00:48,821 --> 01:00:50,691
The balls are way too small.

1011
01:00:51,153 --> 01:00:52,943
Hey, I don't see any balls.

1012
01:00:53,571 --> 01:00:54,955
I know.
I wonder if they're all outside.

1013
01:00:54,956 --> 01:00:58,374
[They won't be able to oust anyone
without these balls...]

1014
01:00:58,703 --> 01:01:00,686
No, they're basketballs.

1015
01:01:01,404 --> 01:01:04,565
[Jin Young is searching through
the kitchen on the first floor.]

1016
01:01:07,935 --> 01:01:12,102
[A basketball is finally found!]

1017
01:01:13,371 --> 01:01:15,015
[Hides it underneath his jacket.]

1018
01:01:19,509 --> 01:01:21,042
This is ridiculous.

1019
01:01:23,229 --> 01:01:26,578
[Finds a basketball in the recycling bin.]

1020
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:33,976
- Ji Hyo's hoop is over there.
- Where's Jong Kook's hoop?

1021
01:01:35,221 --> 01:01:37,451
[I'm going to make all the goals.]

1022
01:01:44,380 --> 01:01:47,903
[Chan Sung must hurry over to his opponent's
hoop before the ball is stolen away from him.]

1023
01:01:48,654 --> 01:01:50,465
[Jin Young rushes along with
his own ball under his jacket.]

1024
01:01:51,080 --> 01:01:52,481
Chan Sung!

1025
01:01:52,482 --> 01:01:54,726
[His goal is Kwang Soo's hoop.]

1026
01:01:58,580 --> 01:02:00,937
[He must make the goal in order
to oust Kwang Soo.]

1027
01:02:04,804 --> 01:02:06,708
[They must be stopped!]

1028
01:02:13,630 --> 01:02:16,388
[Right into Kwang Soo's hoop!]

1029
01:02:17,419 --> 01:02:19,264
I found that ball.

1030
01:02:20,626 --> 01:02:24,146
[I should've been quicker about
getting here for the rebound...]

1031
01:02:25,547 --> 01:02:27,268
We can't have Kwang Soo be ousted.

1032
01:02:27,992 --> 01:02:31,268
Lee Kwang Soo, out!

1033
01:02:31,269 --> 01:02:33,391
- What just happened?
- Lee Kwang Soo, out.

1034
01:02:33,392 --> 01:02:36,430
- Lee Kwang Soo, out.
- Why is it me of all people!

1035
01:02:37,352 --> 01:02:38,908
Why does it have to be me!

1036
01:02:39,430 --> 01:02:40,792
Who did this!

1037
01:02:41,660 --> 01:02:43,416
- Kwang Soo!
- Who did it? Who got me ousted?

1038
01:02:43,417 --> 01:02:45,428
I feel so sad!

1039
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:51,193
Why is it me of all people?

1040
01:02:52,204 --> 01:02:55,326
[Giant center, Lee Kwang Soo,
is the first one to get ousted.]

1041
01:02:55,327 --> 01:02:56,632
Is it really me?

1042
01:02:57,626 --> 01:02:59,734
Wow, they found that one quick.

1043
01:02:59,735 --> 01:03:01,552
There aren't even any cameras in here.

1044
01:03:02,202 --> 01:03:04,506
[No cameras in the jail cell.]

1045
01:03:04,507 --> 01:03:07,942
I wanted to show off my basketball skills.
I should've guarded my own hoop.

1046
01:03:09,978 --> 01:03:11,921
Jong Kook's hoop is on the second floor!

1047

[Jae Suk's hoop is Chan Sung's target.]

1050
01:03:20,719 --> 01:03:22,074
Let's oust Jae Suk.

1051
01:03:27,894 --> 01:03:29,416
Where did you find your ball?

1052
01:03:29,646 --> 01:03:31,512

1053
01:03:31,513 --> 01:03:34,588
- I don't see any balls.

[Throwing the name tag of the fallen
carelessly down to the ground.]

1063
01:03:58,822 --> 01:04:00,654
Why are you treating our name tags like that?

1064
01:04:01,730 --> 01:04:04,339
[Side by side...]

1065
01:04:05,854 --> 01:04:08,327

What do you have?

1072
01:04:49,579 --> 01:04:51,089
No!
He needs to be stopped!

1073
01:04:55,839 --> 01:04:58,004

by the Kwang Soo comparison.]

01:08:13,815 --> 01:08:16,991
<i>Gary, out.</i>

1127
01:08:17,494 --> 01:08:19,853
I got ousted by the ball I found.

1128
01:08:19,854 --> 01:08:21,672
[This player gets ousted by
the ball he found himself.]

1129
01:08:21,673 --> 01:08:24,901
<i>Gary, out.</i>

1130
01:08:24,902 --> 01:08:26,658
Why are we the only ones
getting ousted?

1131
01:08:27,367 --> 01:08:30,218
[Could this be a perfect game
for the City Idols?]

1132
01:08:32,043 --> 01:08:33,504
Do an alley oop.

1133
01:08:34,536 --> 01:08:37,638
[Ousts Big-nose with a fancy basketball move.]

1134
01:08:37,639 --> 01:08:41,022
<i>Ji Suk Jin, out.</i>

1135
01:08:41,023 --> 01:08:42,776
So Ji Hyo's the only one left now?

1136
01:08:42,777 --> 01:08:45,148
Ji Hyo won't even be able to make the goal
even if she does find a ball.

1137
01:08:45,966 --> 01:08:48,953
- We should've stolen the ball away from them.
- Why can't we find any balls?

1138
01:08:48,954 --> 01:08:50,581
[These ousted players sure have
a lot to say on how it should be played.]

1139
01:08:50,582 --> 01:08:53,081
I'm the only one left from my team.

1140
01:08:55,872 --> 01:08:58,104
Hey, you cruel little rascals!

1141
01:08:59,669 --> 01:09:03,330
[It's a basketball party!]

1142
01:09:08,095 --> 01:09:10,557
[My poor basketball hoop.]

1143
01:09:12,573 --> 01:09:15,793
[A point shooter to see who can make it.]

1144
01:09:23,646 --> 01:09:27,545
[Hoya ousts Ji Hyo.]

1145
01:09:29,722 --> 01:09:31,658
<i>Song Ji Hyo, out.</i>

1146
01:09:31,659 --> 01:09:36,298
[Every member of City Idol Team
is still left alive.]

1147
01:09:36,299 --> 01:09:38,118
Hoya actually did something!

1148
01:09:41,586 --> 01:09:43,668
How can the score be seven to nothing?

1149
01:09:43,669 --> 01:09:47,425
[The final score-
City Idols: 7 vs. Rural Idols: 0]

1150
01:09:50,974 --> 01:09:54,008
With the perfect score of seven to zero,
City Idols win this mission.

1151
01:09:54,009 --> 01:09:57,229
[City Idols win the basketball
name tag elimination game.]

1152
01:09:59,334 --> 01:10:01,905
[Wins the final chance card.]

1153
01:10:01,906 --> 01:10:03,543
We will immediately go into
your final mission.

1154
01:10:03,544 --> 01:10:05,404
For your final competition...

1155
01:10:05,405 --> 01:10:07,166
It's a rural relay race.

1156
01:10:07,167 --> 01:10:09,103
- Rural relay?
- Will we be running?

1157
01:10:09,104 --> 01:10:14,280
The team that has two chance cards will be
given the first option to choose.

1158
01:10:15,263 --> 01:10:17,893
Team Running Man won the first
two rounds of the games, correct?

1159
01:10:17,894 --> 01:10:20,900
- Yes, we have two chance cards.
- Swap them in for these.

1160
01:10:22,285 --> 01:10:23,607
Here are your two.

1161
01:10:23,872 --> 01:10:28,192
Rural Relay.
Big vs Small and Heavy vs Light.

1162
01:10:28,193 --> 01:10:30,546
- What's this?
- Heavy and Light.

1163
01:10:30,547 --> 01:10:32,582
It's not 'Cham', but it's 'Joong'.

1164
01:10:33,675 --> 01:10:36,010
Why would he think that this is 'Cham'?

1165
01:10:36,882 --> 01:10:38,760
I didn't see it closely enough.

1166
01:10:40,040 --> 01:10:42,271
Okay, the light and the big!

1167
01:10:43,903 --> 01:10:45,794
You can take this one and
make your selection.

1168
01:10:45,795 --> 01:10:47,511
[City Idol trade in their one chance card.]

1169
01:10:48,377 --> 01:10:51,795
There's a vertical oval,
and a horizontal oval.

1170
01:10:51,796 --> 01:10:54,196
- We have to pick one or the other?
- I think...

1171
01:10:54,529 --> 01:10:57,266
I think it's something
we'll have to climb through.

1172
01:10:57,835 --> 01:10:59,573
Don't act like you're all smart.

1173
01:11:02,112 --> 01:11:05,262
- Which one should we go with?
- We'll go with the 'won'.

1174
01:11:05,263 --> 01:11:08,292
The round one?
Okay, you've now made your selection.

1175
01:11:08,293 --> 01:11:10,514
The selection process is now over.

1176
01:11:10,515 --> 01:11:13,263
This is your final competition.
This will determine the ultimate winner.

1177
01:11:13,264 --> 01:11:14,798
- You may get going.
- Let's go!

1178
01:11:14,799 --> 01:11:17,402
[The winning team of this competition will be
crowned the Nation's Top Idol Group.]

1179
01:11:18,762 --> 01:11:21,606
[The final competition.]

1180
01:11:23,528 --> 01:11:35,230
[A spectacle of a race
in the middle of a farm field.]

1181
01:11:35,231 --> 01:11:37,191
This really is a spectacle.

1182
01:11:37,192 --> 01:11:39,422
This is the real blockbuster.

1183
01:11:39,423 --> 01:11:42,418
- Look at all this setup.
- This truly is a blockbuster.

1184
01:11:43,708 --> 01:11:46,649
[An unbelievable scale.]

1185
01:11:47,004 --> 01:11:49,653
- It's really overwhelming.
- As I told you all before...

1186
01:11:49,654 --> 01:11:52,800
the title of this final competition is,
Rural Relay Race.

1187
01:11:53,412 --> 01:11:57,537
You'll have to pass through each
of the courses in a team relay form.

1188
01:11:57,762 --> 01:12:00,014
There are a variety of different courses
that have been prepared for you.

1189
01:12:01,768 --> 01:12:05,498
Do you see the banner over there
at the edge of the field?

1190
01:12:05,982 --> 01:12:10,000
The first runner will start off from there
with the water buckets

1191
01:12:10,001 --> 01:12:14,921
and will run towards the first flag
with the buckets full of water.

1192
01:12:15,723 --> 01:12:18,970
And if you take a look over there,
you'll see a huge water jug waiting.

1193
01:12:18,971 --> 01:12:23,345
You have to pour the water into the jug,
and you'll see a little buoy marked, 'Pass'.

1194
01:12:23,346 --> 01:12:25,248
If you pour enough water in there,
that buoy will fall out of the jug.

1195
01:12:25,249 --> 01:12:27,595
There's a small and a big water jug.

1196
01:12:27,891 --> 01:12:29,902
Your team chose 'large'
during the selection process.

1197
01:12:29,903 --> 01:12:31,947
[Rural Idol Team selected the larger size
back during the selection process.]

1198
01:12:33,377 --> 01:12:37,574
Since you chose the larger size,
you chose poorly.

1199
01:12:37,575 --> 01:12:38,959
We should've gone with the small.

1200
01:12:39,326 --> 01:12:42,547
- Who said we should go with the big one?
- Yoo Jae Suk!

1201
01:12:45,079 --> 01:12:46,759
There's one more thing.

1202
01:12:47,379 --> 01:12:51,179
There's a small hole in the bottom
of the water jugs.

1203
01:12:51,180 --> 01:12:54,687
[Must pour the water into
the jug with the hole.]

1204
01:12:54,688 --> 01:12:56,771
You have to pour the water into the jug
with the hole on the bottom.

1205
01:12:57,041 --> 01:13:01,674
Then the third runner will run
over to the pile of hay in the next course.

1206
01:13:01,675 --> 01:13:04,116
The third runner will have to run
up over the pile of hay.

1207
01:13:04,117 --> 01:13:06,022
Then you'll have to jump down
from that pile of hay.

1208
01:13:06,023 --> 01:13:10,953
Then the fourth runner will have to run
over to the metal bar structure.

1209
01:13:10,954 --> 01:13:14,706
Then the fourth runner can throw their bag
over the metal bar.

1210
01:13:14,707 --> 01:13:17,180
This course involved another
selection process.

1211
01:13:17,474 --> 01:13:20,223
It was light and heavy selection,
and you selected the lighter option.

1212
01:13:20,224 --> 01:13:22,657
There are two rice sacks
you'll see over by the metal bar.

1213
01:13:22,658 --> 01:13:24,692
[Rice pouch is what they'll have to throw.]

1214
01:13:25,295 --> 01:13:28,582
Since you selected the lighter option,
you can throw the lighter rice sack.

1215
01:13:28,583 --> 01:13:32,690
[Throw the rice sack.
10kg vs 20 kg.]

1216
01:13:33,329 --> 01:13:37,261
City Idol Team will have to throw
the heavy sack over the bar.

1217
01:13:37,262 --> 01:13:38,655
Okay, Chan Sung!

1218
01:13:39,109 --> 01:13:42,143
[Beast Idol is unanimously chosen
to be the bearer of the burden?]

1219
01:13:42,144 --> 01:13:45,234
Then the next runner will have to run
over to the R5 course

1220
01:13:46,044 --> 01:13:50,216
with an item on a serving tray
which will be balanced on top of the head.

1221
01:13:51,038 --> 01:13:55,194
You made your selection of your own
during your selection process.

1222
01:13:55,195 --> 01:13:59,103
Thus, you will have to balance a ball
on the tray on your head.

1223
01:13:59,104 --> 01:14:00,766
[City Idol must balance a ball on the tray.]

1224
01:14:01,916 --> 01:14:05,620
Which means that Rural Idol Team will
get to balance a shoe on their tray.

1225
01:14:05,976 --> 01:14:09,602
[Rural Idol Team gets to balance
a show on their tray.]

1226
01:14:12,170 --> 01:14:14,331
If either the ball or
the shoe falls off the tray

1227
01:14:14,332 --> 01:14:17,243
then that person will have to go back
and start over from their starting position.

1228
01:14:17,244 --> 01:14:18,974
Yes, that's the way to do it!

1229
01:14:19,615 --> 01:14:22,285
[A ball will surely fall off the tray...]

1230
01:14:22,286 --> 01:14:25,613
Then did you all see the metal structure
by the R5 flag?

1231
01:14:25,614 --> 01:14:28,918
The R5 course will require you
to start a fire.

1232
01:14:29,371 --> 01:14:31,796
- You'll have to manually start a fire.
- Manually?

1233
01:14:33,336 --> 01:14:35,742
Once you succeed in starting the fire

1234
01:14:36,156 --> 01:14:40,419
then the final runner will run down
the rest of the relay course

1235
01:14:40,454 --> 01:14:42,621
and cross through the finish line
to win the race.

1236
01:14:43,046 --> 01:14:45,023
If we lose this,
then we lose the entire race.

1237
01:14:45,024 --> 01:14:47,328
- We have to win this.
- Let's all cheers before we start.

1238
01:14:47,329 --> 01:14:52,797
[The title of Nation's Top Idol Group
will be ours!]

1239
01:14:54,263 --> 01:14:58,271
If you've decided where you'll be going,
then everyone move off to your own stations.

1240
01:14:58,291 --> 01:15:00,282
The strongest person
always starts off any race.

1241
01:15:00,283 --> 01:15:02,620
You're the leader of your team, right?
I'm the leader of mine too.

1242
01:15:02,621 --> 01:15:04,727
- I'm like the leader of my team too.
- Of course you are.

1243
01:15:04,728 --> 01:15:07,597
[Run with the water carrying yoke
to fill up the water jugs.]

1244
01:15:07,598 --> 01:15:09,405
- This is very heavy.
- Should I give it a try?

1245
01:15:10,232 --> 01:15:13,378
[A white rubber shoe is their baton.]

1246
01:15:15,330 --> 01:15:17,181
This is making me unsteady on my feet.

1247
01:15:18,780 --> 01:15:23,323
[R1- Pouring water in the jar with the hole-
Ha Ha and Sung Gyu.]

1248
01:15:23,324 --> 01:15:25,234
You notice that we don't ever get
the really crucial missions?

1249
01:15:26,115 --> 01:15:28,897
- We're just given tasks which we can handle.
- The last runner never does things like this.

1250
01:15:30,612 --> 01:15:36,086
[But pouring water in these jugs
really is an important role...]

1251
01:15:36,087 --> 01:15:37,661
I really want to do this well.

1252
01:15:40,038 --> 01:15:41,722
I feel really nervous for some reason.

1253
01:15:41,723 --> 01:15:43,757
You're doing this one?

1254
01:15:43,758 --> 01:15:47,412
[R2- Climb and jump down from the haystack-
Jong Kook and Min Ho.]

1255
01:15:47,413 --> 01:15:48,956
Why are you doing this one?

1256
01:15:48,957 --> 01:15:53,929
[Stay tuned for what's to come
on this haystack!]

1257
01:15:54,939 --> 01:15:57,838
[R3- Throw the rice sack over the metal bar.
Kwang Soo vs Chan Sung.]

1258
01:15:58,391 --> 01:16:00,572
This is sure to fall off the tray.

1259
01:16:00,573 --> 01:16:03,568
[R4- Run with the item on the tray.
Ji Hyo vs Bora.]

1260
01:16:07,715 --> 01:16:09,397
- It already fell off.
- See?

1261
01:16:09,876 --> 01:16:13,031
[The rubber ball is definitely a disadvantage
compared to the shoe.]

1262
01:16:15,226 --> 01:16:19,941
[But Ji Hyo is still kindly coaching
Bora on the best way to clear her mission.]

1263
01:16:22,609 --> 01:16:25,414
[R5- Manually start a fire to roast a chicken-
Jae Suk vs Min Hyuk.]

1264
01:16:25,415 --> 01:16:27,152
I don't know if it's even possible to
start a fire with this.

1265
01:16:29,330 --> 01:16:30,732
I think this will be okay.

1266
01:16:33,286 --> 01:16:34,973
I've never had to start
a fire like this before.

1267
01:16:34,974 --> 01:16:36,321
Me neither.

1268
01:16:37,234 --> 01:16:40,455
[There aren't that many people who have
had to start a fire by using a flint.]

1269
01:16:41,878 --> 01:16:46,539
R6- Run while wearing the rubber shoe baton
to the finish line- Gary vs Hoya.]

1270
01:16:46,540 --> 01:16:48,374
I think Hoya has finally found something
that he'll be good at.

1271
01:16:48,993 --> 01:16:51,605
Okay, everyone get in their positions.

1272
01:16:51,606 --> 01:16:53,349
[Time to start he final relay race!]

1273
01:16:54,157 --> 01:16:55,809
Fighting!

1274
01:16:56,738 --> 01:16:58,369
Let's win this!

1275
01:16:58,667 --> 01:17:00,827
Just don't spill any water,
and we'll be okay, Jin Young.

1276
01:17:00,828 --> 01:17:03,448
[Everyone is waiting on standby
at their appropriate stations.]

1277
01:17:04,831 --> 01:17:06,695
Fighting!
Please!

1278
01:17:06,696 --> 01:17:10,115
[With the honor of being crowned
'Nation's Top Idol Group' on the line.]

1279
01:17:10,815 --> 01:17:12,794
- Take your time, Suk Jin.
- Fighting!

1280
01:17:12,795 --> 01:17:14,259
Don't spill any of the water.

1281
01:17:18,570 --> 01:17:20,191
[Good luck, everyone!]

1282
01:17:27,046 --> 01:17:29,378
- Take your time, okay?
- Don't spill any of the water!

1283
01:17:31,109 --> 01:17:33,475
- Take your time, okay?

[And fill up the rest from the large jug
with a water scooper.]

1298
01:18:34,027 --> 01:18:35,841
You have to do it in quick successions!

1299
01:18:36,155 --> 01:18:37,947

the water continues to leak out.]

1301

[Pour in from the top,
and leak out from the bottom!]

1302
01:18:51,243 --> 01:18:53,505
All the water is falling out of the jug!

1303
01:18:54,862 --> 01:19:00,857
[Must pour in a larger quantity of water
than the quantity of water leaking out.]

1304
01:19:07,918 --> 01:19:10,344
Calm down.
Sung Gyu, you need to be more calm.

1305
01:19:12,054 --> 01:19:15,572
[The buoy marked, 'Pass', must fall out
of the jug to pass this course.]

1306

[The buoy is starting to rise to the top!]

1308
01:19:23,255 --> 01:19:25,443

for both of the teams.]

to get ready at their position.]

- I can see it. Just a couple of scoops.

1312
01:19:38,851 --> 01:19:41,005
[Did Ha Ha succeed?]

1313
01:19:41,926 --> 01:19:44,112
[So close!]

1314
01:19:55,092 --> 01:19:56,122
I got it.

1315
01:19:56,123 --> 01:19:58,260
[Ha Ha succeeds.]

1316
01:19:58,736 --> 01:20:00,860

at the Big-Small jug course.]

[Climbing up the gigantic pile of hay.]

1323
01:20:31,304 --> 01:20:33,751
Look at Jong Kook over there.
Even he's struggling with that pile.

1324
01:20:33,752 --> 01:20:35,749

then you'll have to go back.

1333

No!

1334
01:21:21,572 --> 01:21:23,412

- Wait for me, Ji Hyo.

1352
01:22:42,590 --> 01:22:44,939

[This Beast Idol has to throw the heavy
sack of rice over the metal bar.]

1362

[Wow! He succeeds in throwing it over
on his first attempt!]

1370
01:24:00,078 --> 01:24:03,019
[Must start the fire and get the fire big
enough for the flames to touch the chicken.]

1371
01:24:06,615 --> 01:24:08,397
You almost got it, Jae Suk.

1372
01:24:11,241 --> 01:24:14,402
[Come on, Bora!]

1373
01:24:15,143 --> 01:24:16,977

of thin tissue paper.]

the fire immediately thereafter.]

1392
01:25:51,342 --> 01:25:55,274
[Crucial to keep the flames roaring
so that the fire doesn't die out.]

1393
01:25:55,917 --> 01:25:59,129
[With the gusty winds blowing at it,
the flames are all over the place.]

1394
01:25:59,130 --> 01:26:01,783
[Must cook the roasted chicken with the fire
to clear this course.]

1395
01:26:04,277 --> 01:26:06,384
Check and see if the fire is
lit around the back too.

1396
01:26:06,602 --> 01:26:08,468
We have to keep the flames
from going out.

1397
01:26:08,996 --> 01:26:11,566
Block the wind from blowing it out.

1398

[We were able to safely film this segment
with the help from the local fire department.]

1400
01:26:18,336 --> 01:26:19,845
I didn't know it would be this hard
to start the fire with the flint.

1401
01:26:20,672 --> 01:26:24,845
[The key to winning this course is
to be able to coax the fire into a blaze.]

[Rural Idols succeeds in cooking the chicken
with the help of dry hay straw!]

1409
01:27:09,119 --> 01:27:11,445

then give it a try!]

[Just how will it end?]

1420
01:28:03,150 --> 01:28:08,036
[The title of being crowned
'The Nation's Top Idol Group' is on the line.]

1421
01:28:28,251 --> 01:28:30,872
[Too big of a gap for it to have been
possible to take over the lead.]

1422
01:28:31,750 --> 01:28:33,920
[Mr. Gary is already only 50cm away
from crossing the finish line.]

1423
01:28:36,950 --> 01:28:39,276
Let's start over together from right here.

1424
01:28:39,980 --> 01:28:41,541
No, I can't do that.

1425
01:28:43,531 --> 01:28:45,450
[Why would I do that?]

1426
01:28:46,567 --> 01:28:49,190
[Crosses the finish line by doing the wave.]

1427
01:28:51,685 --> 01:28:55,403
[Rural Idol Team wins the race!]

1428
01:28:58,216 --> 01:28:59,647
Sorry, Hoya.

1429
01:29:00,047 --> 01:29:01,592
I got the fire going first.

1430
01:29:02,303 --> 01:29:07,092
Thus, the honor of being crowned the
Nation's Top Idol Group goes to Team RM.

1431
01:29:07,093 --> 01:29:09,213
Sorry, but what else could we do?

1432
01:29:09,769 --> 01:29:13,098
[Prize of gold rings are given out to
the Rural Idol Team for winning the race.]

1433
01:29:14,129 --> 01:29:16,476
We're not familiar with things like this
because we're all still so young.

1434
01:29:16,843 --> 01:29:19,631
We didn't live back in
the prehistoric times either!

1435
01:29:19,632 --> 01:29:21,010
You think we use these flints to
light a fire every day?

1436
01:29:21,011 --> 01:29:24,301
- This was my first time too.
- We're all still very young too!

1437

of being the Nation's Top Idol Group title!
