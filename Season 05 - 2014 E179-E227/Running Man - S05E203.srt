[With all the romance of a summer night...]

6
00:00:28,646 --> 00:00:31,529
[Like a midsummer night's dream.]

7
00:00:33,275 --> 00:00:38,150
[While all the Running Man members
are peacefully asleep...]

8
00:00:38,151 --> 00:00:43,335
[mystical rain falls down from the sky.]

9
00:00:45,546 --> 00:00:54,456
[What sort of an adventure will this
mystical rain bring about tomorrow?]

10
00:00:57,322 --> 00:00:59,884
[The next morning.]

11
00:01:01,356 --> 00:01:02,743
Hello.

12
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:08,759
[One by one, they all start to walk in.]

13
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:15,858
All the girls are here without any
of their makeup on this morning.

14
00:01:16,467 --> 00:01:20,462
But they don't look any different at all.
Bo Mi and Na Eun still look the same.

15
00:01:20,463 --> 00:01:23,331
- What about you?
- I put a little bit on.

16
00:01:28,791 --> 00:01:31,586
[Their lashes looks
a bit different in the morning.]

17
00:01:31,587 --> 00:01:33,955
Bo Mi, I thought you were angry for a minute.

18
00:01:35,463 --> 00:01:39,055
Today's race is called,
'One Day Tour.'

19
00:01:39,056 --> 00:01:43,686
You will be going on an all-day tour.

20
00:01:43,687 --> 00:01:47,977
Even though none of you are
unfortunately able to remember

21
00:01:47,978 --> 00:01:54,516
but you will be participating in today's race
as part of a couple with a special meaning.

22
00:01:56,386 --> 00:02:00,272
[So the rain from last night was a
work of magic to erase their memories?]

23
00:02:00,273 --> 00:02:04,172
You must successfully complete
all of your missions in today's race

24
00:02:04,173 --> 00:02:09,032
and the sooner you arrive at the final spot,
then the bigger your winning prize will be.

25
00:02:09,917 --> 00:02:13,123
Then I will now announce
the couples for the day.

26
00:02:14,115 --> 00:02:16,369
- First up is, Yoo Jae Suk.
- Okay.

27
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:21,328
Yoo Jae Suk will be coupled off with
Joo Ji Hoon as the Best Looking Couple.

Next couple is, Lee Kwang Soo and Ji Sung.

37
00:03:05,465 --> 00:03:08,368

38
00:03:08,403 --> 00:03:12,870

We used to play pool together for real.

44
00:03:29,692 --> 00:03:32,872

with all the pretty female guests?

Ji Suk Jin and Song Ji Hyo are
the Sibling Couple.

46
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:41,408
You may not remember this

47
00:03:41,409 --> 00:03:44,526
but your brother, Suk Jin, lost all
your inheritance on a failed investment idea

48
00:03:44,527 --> 00:03:47,818

00:04:06,343 --> 00:04:10,172
Each team will travel in their own car
during the entirety of the race

54
00:04:10,207 --> 00:04:12,330
and we hope that you'll be able to recover
all your lost memories.

55
00:04:12,331 --> 00:04:15,335
[Recover the lost memories during the trip!]

56

00:04:56,032 --> 00:04:58,801
- That's going to be up to Jong Kook.
- I want the wild strawberries.

65
00:04:58,802 --> 00:05:02,507
- Me too. I want the wild strawberries.
- Where? The strawberries?

66
00:05:02,508 --> 00:05:05,216
- Is it because of Na Eun?
- Yes, that's correct.

67
00:05:05,217 --> 00:05:07,864
- Where are you two going?
- To the strawberries.

68
00:05:07,865 --> 00:05:09,790
Strawberries?
You're strawberries too?

69

Everyone wants to follow Na Eun
to the strawberries.

70

[Everyone is off to the wild strawberries.]

Everyone's following Na Eun
to the strawberries.

72
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:25,746
- We'll go to the stone grandmother.
- We're going to the stone grandmother.

73
00:05:25,747 --> 00:05:28,740
Then you two go with them
to the stone grandmother.

74
00:05:28,741 --> 00:05:31,137
That's a nice twist to the couples.

75
00:05:31,138 --> 00:05:34,469
[Monday Couple and yesterday's couple,
Suk Jin and Yu Ram.]

76
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:36,853
You will have to go to the silk farm.

77
00:05:36,854 --> 00:05:43,551
Your VJ's will be following you all day,
including during your meal times.

78
00:05:43,552 --> 00:05:45,045
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

79
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:49,994
Let's just relax and enjoy the day together.

80
00:05:49,995 --> 00:05:52,370
[Overly confident Blind Date Couple.]

81
00:05:52,371 --> 00:05:55,053
I feel even shorter with you as my partner.

82
00:05:57,570 --> 00:06:00,372
- Suk Jin's already falling behind?
- Huh? How so?

83
00:06:01,133 --> 00:06:02,743
What about Suk Jin?

84
00:06:02,744 --> 00:06:06,248
Where did Na Eun go?
She's already way down there.

85
00:06:06,249 --> 00:06:09,655
[Why did he just rip off Ji Hoon's name tag?]

86
00:06:10,446 --> 00:06:11,887
Thank you.

87
00:06:13,218 --> 00:06:18,169
- You did good, Ji Hoon.
- The three of us did it together.

88
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:23,915
[These four men seem to be on
very friendly terms with each other.]

89
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:26,729
Look at all the men that are following
in Na Eun's path right now.

90
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:30,731
Look behind you, Na Eun.
Look at all the men that are following you.

91
00:06:31,395 --> 00:06:33,942
- They're all following you right now.
- Son Na Eun!

92
00:06:33,943 --> 00:06:39,820
Son Na Eun!

93
00:06:42,573 --> 00:06:44,422
Wait, let me get it straight on there.

94
00:06:44,423 --> 00:06:48,516
[Huh? Now Ji Sung is ripping off
and reattaching Otswiri's name tag?]

95
00:06:48,517 --> 00:06:52,933
[Why is he doing what Kwang Soo just did?]

96
00:06:54,176 --> 00:06:58,358
Jong Kook is going to be 40 next year.
Kim-forty!

97
00:06:59,553 --> 00:07:02,558
- What are you doing?
- Why would you say that?

98
00:07:02,559 --> 00:07:04,606
It's Na Eun and Forty.

99
00:07:05,174 --> 00:07:08,630
Son Na Eun.
Kim Forty.

100
00:07:08,631 --> 00:07:11,488
[MC Mem's rhyme-
Son Na Eun and Kim Forty.]

101
00:07:13,481 --> 00:07:15,005
Where do we have to go?

102
00:07:16,148 --> 00:07:19,236
- Which car do we have to take?
- We have to be more nonchalant.

103
00:07:20,986 --> 00:07:24,612
[More nonchalant about what?]

104
00:07:25,894 --> 00:07:28,419
I thought that could've been our chance.

105
00:07:29,992 --> 00:07:33,674
[Their chance?]

106
00:07:35,016 --> 00:07:39,847
[Just what are these two up to?]

107
00:07:46,681 --> 00:07:50,131
[One hour ago at 5:25 AM.]

108
00:07:50,822 --> 00:07:53,419
<i>Lee Kwang Soo and Ji Sung,
come down to room 303 immediately.</i>

[Automatically breaks out into a smile at
the anticipation of a secret mission.]

110
00:08:07,154 --> 00:08:09,003
Just me?

111
00:08:11,271 --> 00:08:13,674
[No way...]

112
00:08:16,444 --> 00:08:19,519
This must be something very important.

113
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:29,876
We woke you two up an hour before
waking up any of the other members.

114
00:08:29,877 --> 00:08:35,863
You are here as the Client
and the Troubleshooter.

115
00:08:35,864 --> 00:08:37,765
You don't remember
any of that right now, right?

116
00:08:37,766 --> 00:08:40,987
- That's because...
- What are you doing right now?

117
00:08:40,988 --> 00:08:44,019
You are suffering from
memory loss at the moment.

118
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:47,871
[Suffering from memory loss
after last night's magical rain.]

119
00:08:47,872 --> 00:08:51,614
You may use this to help you
recover your lost memories.

120
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:57,493
[Evidence of Kwang Soo's SNS.]

121
00:08:58,005 --> 00:08:59,907
<i>I don't think that the person
can be trusted.</i>

122
00:08:59,908 --> 00:09:03,881
<i>I ruined myself by following in the lead of
someone who's never won anything before.</i>

123
00:09:03,882 --> 00:09:06,402
I will get my revenge for my ruin.

124
00:09:06,403 --> 00:09:08,481
Just what did Suk Jin do to me?

125
00:09:09,538 --> 00:09:11,457
- Read the next one.
- [I almost got beat up again.]

126
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:13,934
<i>I even received threats of impending
beatings if I were to betray again.</i>

127
00:09:13,935 --> 00:09:17,551
<i>You know something?
You're just a muscle head dummy.</i>

128
00:09:18,487 --> 00:09:20,228
Kim Jong Kook.

129
00:09:21,611 --> 00:09:23,977
- Why is your life so pathetic?
- Come on, Ji Sung.

130
00:09:25,345 --> 00:09:29,166
[Even his own teammate can't help but
feel pity for Kwang Soo's past.]

131
00:09:34,544 --> 00:09:40,000
[Kwang Soo has pent up anger and
desire for revenge towards other members.]

132
00:09:46,635 --> 00:09:47,857
<i>Ji Sung is so kind.</i>

133
00:09:47,858 --> 00:09:51,756
<i>He event lent me the 23,000 won I needed
when I asked him to borrow some money.</i>

134
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:53,826
<i>A top star like him
is so different from others.</i>

135
00:09:53,827 --> 00:09:56,645
<i>Ji Sung may be the only person
that I can trust.</i>

136
00:09:56,646 --> 00:09:58,688
I forgot about all that.

137
00:09:58,689 --> 00:10:04,768
As you may have realized, you have a personal
grudge against all the other members.

138
00:10:05,247 --> 00:10:08,354
You only trust Ji Sung.

139
00:10:08,355 --> 00:10:12,445
That's because Ji Sung has always
treated Kwang Soo with kindness and grace.

140
00:10:12,446 --> 00:10:19,745
So you're here as the 'Troubleshooter'
to help Kwang Soo with his grudges.

141
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:22,974
So we both lost our memories the moment
he asked me for my help?

142
00:10:22,975 --> 00:10:24,730
Yes, that's correct.

143
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:28,093
- So my memories have just been recovered?
- Yes, that's correct.

144
00:10:28,835 --> 00:10:30,889
Are you starting to remember
everything now?

145
00:10:33,439 --> 00:10:35,063
No, you probably don't.

146
00:10:37,451 --> 00:10:40,848
[Fails at the dramatic enactment.]

147
00:10:42,609 --> 00:10:44,376
Just tell me what kind of a timeline I'm on.

148
00:10:44,377 --> 00:10:47,671
When I should get my headache,
and when I should get my memories back.

149
00:10:47,672 --> 00:10:52,637
When the rest of the members are up in a few,
they will all be coupled off like you two

150
00:10:53,502 --> 00:10:55,420
and we will start today's race.

151
00:10:55,421 --> 00:10:59,359
You two will disguise yourselves
as one of the couples.

152
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,808
You will then successfully complete your
missions and come to the final destination.

153
00:11:02,809 --> 00:11:05,432
And those couples who arrive at the final
destination after you guys

154
00:11:05,433 --> 00:11:08,098
will have to forfeit their prizes
over to you.

155
00:11:08,099 --> 00:11:10,907
In addition, today's filming
of the show will be nonstop.

156
00:11:10,908 --> 00:11:13,306
In midst of putting up the pretenses

157
00:11:13,307 --> 00:11:15,370
you will have to complete your own
secret missions without others finding out.

158
00:11:15,371 --> 00:11:17,125
I will now tell you what those missions are.

159
00:11:17,563 --> 00:11:22,447
You have to rip off and reattach all 14
of other members' name tags.

160
00:11:22,448 --> 00:11:27,155
[Rip off and reattach all 14
of other members' name tags!]

161
00:11:29,776 --> 00:11:31,706
You want us to rip off
and reattach their name tags?

162
00:11:31,707 --> 00:11:34,500
But those name tags
aren't even that easy to rip off.

163
00:11:34,501 --> 00:11:36,356
But won't they get suspicious if
we were to rip off their name tags?

164
00:11:36,357 --> 00:11:40,513
It's more than feasible if the two of you
work together to come up with the right plan.

165
00:11:40,514 --> 00:11:42,917
I feel bad for Ji Hoon.

166
00:11:42,918 --> 00:11:46,859
This is your chance to get your revenge on him
for what he does to you in the movie.

167
00:11:57,907 --> 00:12:01,659
[Rips off the name tag
without any hesitation...]

168
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:04,726
[And immediately reattaches it.]

169
00:12:07,975 --> 00:12:10,786
[Secret revenge on target, Ji Hoon-
Success.]

170
00:12:11,295 --> 00:12:14,715
But if your mission isn't captured on camera,
then it will not be accepted.

171
00:12:14,716 --> 00:12:20,301
The name tags has to be completely ripped off,
and firmly reattached to their backs.

172
00:12:20,302 --> 00:12:22,391
Ripping it off halfway will not be accepted.

173
00:12:25,059 --> 00:12:27,869
[Ji Sung approaches Otswiri.]

174
00:12:32,005 --> 00:12:34,735
[Ripped off completely...]

175
00:12:34,736 --> 00:12:36,480
[Then reattached.]

176
00:12:36,481 --> 00:12:37,897
- You're all set.
- Thank you.

177
00:12:38,911 --> 00:12:41,785
[No need to thank me.
I should be thanking you.]

178
00:12:42,388 --> 00:12:46,632
All the members are very weary of
anyone getting close to their name tags.

179
00:12:46,633 --> 00:12:50,508
I thought being the Troubleshooter was
a good thing, but this is going to be tough.

180
00:12:50,509 --> 00:12:53,697
- They're all very weary of me already.
- Then I'll do it.

181
00:12:53,698 --> 00:12:55,794
Ripping off their name tag
and attaching it back

182
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,046
is the equivalent of sticking your finger
in their mouths and pulling it back out.

183
00:12:59,047 --> 00:13:05,019
- That's just how weary they are of it.
- This isn't going to be easy.

184
00:13:07,456 --> 00:13:10,126
[Will they be able to succeed
their secret mission?]

185
00:13:10,538 --> 00:13:12,483
Kim Forty...

186
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:19,916
I just got Otswiri because
I thought he might be tough to get later.

187
00:13:19,917 --> 00:13:22,450
We have to get Jong Kook,
but he'll probably get suspicious.

188
00:13:22,451 --> 00:13:24,992
You have to get Jong Kook.

189
00:13:25,964 --> 00:13:31,560
[The biggest hurdle to their success-
The Tiger.]

190
00:13:31,958 --> 00:13:34,829
- You have to get Jong Kook.
- Okay.

191
00:13:40,184 --> 00:13:42,536
[Polite Sung Hyun opens up
the car door for Bo Mi.]

192
00:13:42,537 --> 00:13:45,195
This car is going to be
full of nervous energy.

193
00:13:45,196 --> 00:13:48,876
[Yoo Hyuk tries to instigate a fight
out of his jealousy.]

194
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:52,422
- We're starting to get to know each other.
- Why are you opening the door for her?

195
00:13:52,423 --> 00:13:54,317
Come with us, Otswiri.

196
00:13:54,318 --> 00:13:58,430
[Tourist Couple without their license
is to ride along with the Event Couple.]

197
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:01,495
I'm seriously starting to get
a stomachache.

198
00:14:04,158 --> 00:14:06,317
I don't know what to do.
He says he has a stomachache.

199
00:14:06,318 --> 00:14:08,395
Why are you announcing that to everyone?

200
00:14:08,396 --> 00:14:10,415
- Hey, Yu Ram.
- What am I going to do?

201
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:12,065
He says his stomach hurts.

202
00:14:18,272 --> 00:14:20,981
[Tiger is discovered.]

203
00:14:21,747 --> 00:14:23,646
Jong Kook, we'll see you later.

204
00:14:25,436 --> 00:14:28,652
[Will he be able to rip off
the Tiger's name tag?]

205
00:14:28,653 --> 00:14:31,203
We have to get Jong Kook early on.

206
00:14:31,204 --> 00:14:34,991
We have to get Jong Kook early on
to avoid his suspicion.

207
00:14:36,132 --> 00:14:38,971
I can't even do it halfway,
but I have to rip it off all the way?

208
00:14:38,972 --> 00:14:40,699
You have to rip it completely off.

209
00:14:41,128 --> 00:14:43,550
He's going to think that I'm weird.

210
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:46,898
I'm sure he'll just think that you're rude.

211
00:14:53,174 --> 00:14:58,835
[Ji Sung approaches the Tiger's back.]

212
00:15:01,128 --> 00:15:08,068
[Attempts to rip it off,
then leans into a sudden stretch.]

213
00:15:11,684 --> 00:15:14,924
[Gathers up his courage once more
to approach the Tiger's back again.]

214
00:15:17,283 --> 00:15:23,642
- Na Eun feels like my little sister.
- You look like you're having fun with Na Eun.

215
00:15:25,999 --> 00:15:27,898
- Yes, I'm having fun.
- Your name tag is crooked.

216
00:15:32,031 --> 00:15:34,242
[The Giraffe is ready to run off.]

217
00:15:43,423 --> 00:15:45,999
[It's off!]

218
00:15:49,433 --> 00:15:52,356
[Target- Kim Jong Kook.
Secret mission is a success!]

219
00:15:52,357 --> 00:15:54,575
Ji Sung helped me right
my crooked name tag.

220
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:57,639
- Have fun today.
- Friends are the best.

221
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,713
[The Tiger doesn't suspect
Ji Sung in the least.]

222
00:15:59,714 --> 00:16:01,951
You're a good friend.

223
00:16:02,424 --> 00:16:04,792
[Nice, Ji Sung.]

224
00:16:05,265 --> 00:16:09,242
- My heart was about to beat out of my chest.
- Our car is a bit small.

225
00:16:09,968 --> 00:16:11,712
[Wanting to high-five Ji Sung
out of excitement.]

226
00:16:11,713 --> 00:16:13,626
[Knock it off!]

227
00:16:13,627 --> 00:16:15,741
What are you guys doing?

228
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:21,403
What are you guys doing?

229
00:16:23,641 --> 00:16:26,350
[Have we been caught?]

230
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:29,050
- Where are you guys going? Silk farm?
- To the silk farm.

231
00:16:29,209 --> 00:16:32,825
[We haven't been caught!]

232
00:16:34,039 --> 00:16:38,168
[Almost had a heart attack from
Tiger's question of their intended location.]

233
00:16:39,981 --> 00:16:44,023
So far, we've got Ji Hoon, Otswiri,
and Jong Kook.

234
00:16:44,523 --> 00:16:46,858
We got all the strong players out of the way.

235
00:16:46,859 --> 00:16:50,440
Since we're not going to be together all day,
we have to be careful with our planning.

236
00:16:51,035 --> 00:16:53,574
And you need to be more
cautious in front of Jong Kook.

237
00:16:53,575 --> 00:16:55,412
- Stop being so obvious.
- I'm not good at that.

238
00:16:56,112 --> 00:16:59,408
- What were you thinking with the high-five?
- I wasn't even thinking.

239
00:16:59,409 --> 00:17:01,547
I had completely forgotten about it.

240
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,574
- Where's your hometown?
- I'm from Suwon.

241
00:17:09,977 --> 00:17:12,502
- You grew up in Suwon?
- Yes.

242
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:15,518
- Where's your hometown?
- Me?

243
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:21,465
I grew up mostly in Gwanmyunshi.

244
00:17:22,644 --> 00:17:26,770
[One year couple, but they look more like
they're on their first blind date.]

245
00:17:33,842 --> 00:17:39,225
- Just give me two million won.
- Do you know how hard it is to earn that?

246
00:17:39,226 --> 00:17:43,099
- You make me come all the way down here.
- I just got a call from my friend.

247
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:49,350
[Smart and savvy sister, Blank Ji, is
trying to take care of her useless brother.]

248
00:17:49,351 --> 00:17:51,636
There's a newly developed line of batteries

249
00:17:51,637 --> 00:17:53,206
and if you boil the battery in the water
once it dies, then it recharges it.

250
00:17:53,207 --> 00:17:54,767
Then the battery is like new again.

251
00:17:54,768 --> 00:17:57,047
Boil it in the water,
and it's like new again.

252
00:17:57,048 --> 00:18:01,165
I wish I had two billion instead
of two million to invest in it.

253
00:18:01,166 --> 00:18:05,233
Another idea is the tomato and ginseng seeds.
Ginseng on bottom and tomato on top.

254
00:18:05,234 --> 00:18:08,146
- Have you ever heard of such a thing?
- Ginseng tomatoes?

255
00:18:08,147 --> 00:18:12,080
A friend of mine has a farm,
and he raises chickens with six legs.

256
00:18:12,081 --> 00:18:17,355
[Big-nose Brother's investment ideas-
Six-legged chickens.]

257
00:18:17,356 --> 00:18:20,479
All his chickens have six legs.

258
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:24,943
- His chickens are like insects.
- Chickens with six legs.

259
00:18:26,114 --> 00:18:30,928
[Event Couple and Tourist Couple
are on the move together.]

260
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:36,552
[Haroro's arm is too short to reach
the ticket of the toll booth.]

261
00:18:36,932 --> 00:18:38,837
Get out of the car if your arm can't reach.

262
00:18:41,783 --> 00:18:44,142
[Fabien reaches out
to get the ticket instead.]

263
00:18:46,266 --> 00:18:48,353
That was embarrassing.

264
00:18:49,921 --> 00:18:52,134
I just did that to make everyone laugh.

265
00:18:52,135 --> 00:18:54,580
I used to just get out of the car to do it.

266
00:18:54,581 --> 00:18:58,172
As if that's what you're supposed to do.

267
00:18:59,987 --> 00:19:03,451
I thought you were just going to sit there
in blank silence, but seriously...

268
00:19:03,452 --> 00:19:06,273
- No, I'm doing my best.
- I still can't believe you won the gold.

269
00:19:06,274 --> 00:19:08,047
[Ji Hoon sweeps the gold towers during
last week's quiz battle.]

270
00:19:08,048 --> 00:19:10,915
- I'm sure my mother will be very happy.
- Yes, I'm sure she'll be happy.

271
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:13,223
Your mother won't be the only one either.

272
00:19:14,368 --> 00:19:18,426
[I'm sure this woman
will be happy about it too.]

273
00:19:20,271 --> 00:19:22,158
- I'm feeling quite thirsty.
- Yes, I bet you are.

274
00:19:35,353 --> 00:19:39,198
[Best Looking Couple, Jae Suk and Ji Hoon.]

275
00:19:40,605 --> 00:19:42,201
What is this place?

276
00:19:42,202 --> 00:19:45,313
[Silkworm Experience Learning Center.]

277
00:19:46,625 --> 00:19:50,737
[What kind of an experience
awaits them here?]

278
00:19:50,738 --> 00:19:52,281
Wow, they're silkworms!

279
00:19:55,683 --> 00:20:00,814
[Welcome to the silkworm experience!]

280
00:20:02,063 --> 00:20:03,324
Wow, look at the silkworms.

281
00:20:04,151 --> 00:20:08,776
Welcome to your first experience
learning stop of today's tour.

282
00:20:09,622 --> 00:20:13,578
This is the largest
silkworm farm in Youngchun.

283
00:20:13,579 --> 00:20:16,196
You will get to learn and experience
some new things with the silkworms.

284
00:20:16,197 --> 00:20:19,336
- Before we start your mission...
- They won't stop eating.

285
00:20:19,337 --> 00:20:23,913
In order for you to get closer
to these very clean insects

286
00:20:23,914 --> 00:20:26,708
you need to hold up one of the worms
by the palm of your hand.

287
00:20:28,743 --> 00:20:32,143
- You have to learn to be friends with them.
- We thought they'd be much smaller.

288
00:20:32,144 --> 00:20:34,960
But these silkworms are huge!
They're big as snakes.

289
00:20:35,916 --> 00:20:41,078
I can literally hear them chomping
down on these leaves.

290
00:20:41,079 --> 00:20:43,434
They're really chowing down.

291
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:47,073
You need to grab it with your hands.

292
00:20:49,087 --> 00:20:52,133
- You have to touch them.
- But these silkworms are...

293
00:20:52,134 --> 00:20:54,877
Go on and touch one.

294
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:58,714
[Ji Hoon makes an attempt to touch one
after a moment's hesitation.]

295
00:21:01,216 --> 00:21:04,478
You can't grab it like that.
You have to grab it with your fingers.

296
00:21:05,877 --> 00:21:07,251
Hey, brother.

297
00:21:11,171 --> 00:21:14,258
[Ji Hoon musters up his courage
to touch one of the worms.]

298
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:20,859
[Not as bad as he thought...
or maybe it is.]

299
00:21:22,766 --> 00:21:25,836
That's why I think we need to get
Jae Suk out of the way.

300
00:21:26,174 --> 00:21:28,469
- We have to get to Jae Suk now.
- Okay.

301
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:31,595
But we already got Ji Hoon, right?

302
00:21:31,596 --> 00:21:34,753
- So Ji Hoon could get suspicious.
- I'll be careful around him.

303
00:21:35,143 --> 00:21:37,651
No matter what the case,
I'm happy that I got Jong Kook.

304
00:21:37,652 --> 00:21:39,993
I helped you with Jong Kook too.

305
00:21:39,994 --> 00:21:42,376
It was a fifty-fifty effort.
I helped you with it.

306
00:21:42,854 --> 00:21:44,877
- What?
- Half and half...

307
00:21:45,346 --> 00:21:49,423
[The Client and The Troubleshooter-
a.k.a. Dumb and Dumber.]

308
00:21:50,124 --> 00:21:54,127
Almost half and half?
You 50 percent and I, 49 percent?

309
00:21:56,599 --> 00:21:59,944
[Arrives at the silkworm farm
in the midst of their bickering.]

310
00:22:01,399 --> 00:22:05,089
[Latest target of revenge, Yoo Jae Suk-
We're coming for you!]

311
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:06,723
Kwang Soo.
Come here, Kwang Soo.

312
00:22:06,724 --> 00:22:09,083
[Approaches their target
in a friendly manner.]

313
00:22:10,742 --> 00:22:13,215
[It's a silkworm!]

314
00:22:14,151 --> 00:22:17,741
Jo Hoon, don't do that.
Please don't do that.

315
00:22:17,742 --> 00:22:19,000
[The Client is starting to back away.]

316
00:22:20,566 --> 00:22:23,270
[Just then, the First Anniversary Couple
also arrives on scene.]

317
00:22:23,271 --> 00:22:24,862
- Did you guys get to talk much?
- Yes, we did.

318
00:22:26,861 --> 00:22:29,329
- Listen to Bo Mi scream.
- It's really eating the leaf.

319
00:22:29,572 --> 00:22:32,804
- It's so soft.
- They're really soft.

320
00:22:32,805 --> 00:22:35,046
I had no idea that silkworms were so soft.

321
00:22:35,047 --> 00:22:37,539
- You have touched them, right?
- Of course!

322
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:39,496
[Amazing ability to tell how they feel
without even having touched one.]

323
00:22:41,079 --> 00:22:43,600
- Do they bite?
- No, they don't bite.

324
00:22:50,384 --> 00:22:52,726
That was a pretty rough sound
coming from a girl group member.

325
00:22:57,298 --> 00:22:59,674
Wait, let's do this later.

326
00:23:00,910 --> 00:23:04,299
[Ji Sung introduces a silkworm to Kwang Soo.]

327
00:23:04,934 --> 00:23:06,452
No, let's do this later!

328
00:23:06,453 --> 00:23:08,101
Don't do it!

329
00:23:08,102 --> 00:23:10,953
[Three to one silkworm meeting.]

330
00:23:10,954 --> 00:23:12,762
No, wait!

331
00:23:14,152 --> 00:23:16,343
[Jae Suk adds another to the bunch.]

332
00:23:20,242 --> 00:23:23,517
[Silkworm expert, Ji Sung,
puts one on Bo Mi's arm as well.]

333
00:23:30,848 --> 00:23:33,828
Hurry, Ji Sung!
Get it off of me!

334
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:35,979
Just get it off of me!
Oh, it fell off.

335
00:23:37,569 --> 00:23:38,771
What's this?

336
00:23:39,185 --> 00:23:41,611
What the heck!

337
00:23:41,612 --> 00:23:43,638
What's the purple one!

338
00:23:43,639 --> 00:23:46,306
- The purple one is a silkworm too!
- Seriously?

339
00:23:46,307 --> 00:23:49,049
- The purple one is moving!
- There are purple silkworms?

340
00:23:49,050 --> 00:23:52,610
That happens when a worm eats
some leaves that have been dyed.

341
00:23:52,611 --> 00:23:54,972
[Silkworm changes colors if it eats
leaves that have been dyed a different color.]

342
00:23:54,973 --> 00:23:57,266
[Specialty of Youngchun- Colored Silkworms.]

343
00:23:57,267 --> 00:24:01,548
Okay, as for your mission...
Today is moving day for these silkworms.

344
00:24:02,082 --> 00:24:05,191
- Do you see the two baskets in front of you?
- Yes.

345
00:24:05,192 --> 00:24:09,056
They're already done feeding,
so they need to be moved to their new home.

346
00:24:09,057 --> 00:24:12,151
- You just need to help them move.
- How do we help them move?

347
00:24:12,534 --> 00:24:14,021
Please...

348
00:24:14,022 --> 00:24:17,637
While one member of the team
hangs from the metal bar

349
00:24:17,638 --> 00:24:23,692
the other member has to move ten of the purple
silkworms to their new home.

350
00:24:23,693 --> 00:24:26,255
- You're good at touching the worms, right?
- Ji Hoon, you can touch the worms, right?

351
00:24:26,256 --> 00:24:28,666
[Rushing to dump the silkworm
responsibility onto their partners.]

352
00:24:29,771 --> 00:24:31,858
Just hang from the bar like this?

353
00:24:31,859 --> 00:24:35,040
- You have to have your chin up on the bar.
- With our chin up on the bar?

354
00:24:35,426 --> 00:24:37,691
Ji Hoon, you try hanging from it first.

355
00:24:40,665 --> 00:24:46,167
Ji Hoon sent his girlfriend a text last night
after winning the quiz battle.

356
00:24:47,247 --> 00:24:49,830
- You did?
- And she replied by telling him to shut up.

357
00:24:50,505 --> 00:24:52,880
[That is one tough woman.]

358
00:24:54,275 --> 00:24:58,414
They hid all the purple silkworms
way on the bottom.

359
00:24:58,415 --> 00:25:01,313
Seriously!
I can't see a single purple one!

360
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:04,656
- Ugh, this is driving me crazy.
- Okay, are you ready?

361
00:25:05,132 --> 00:25:08,156
[As soon as they succeed this mission,
they're cleared to go to their next location.]

362
00:25:08,157 --> 00:25:09,828
Let's finish this quickly
and go to our next location.

363
00:25:10,361 --> 00:25:13,840
[We'll rip off your name tag
before that happens.]

[Best Looking Couple-

- I got this wrong.
- What do you mean?

366
00:25:24,465 --> 00:25:26,092
What did you get wrong?

367
00:25:27,242 --> 00:25:32,917
[As soon as he starts...
something is already wrong?]

368
00:25:32,918 --> 00:25:35,197
- I got this all wrong.
- Hang on a second.

369
00:25:35,198 --> 00:25:39,331
- He used up too much energy from the start.
- I got this all wrong.

370
00:25:40,519 --> 00:25:43,657
I think I got this wrong too.
I don't think...

371
00:25:43,658 --> 00:25:45,876
I don't think I can do this.

372
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:48,406
- I don't think I can touch them, Ji Hoon.
- Jae Suk, what are you doing?

373
00:25:48,407 --> 00:25:50,955
They're all getting in my way.
They're all blocking me.

374
00:25:51,615 --> 00:25:54,434
- They're all ganging up on you.
- And they're trying to bite me.

375
00:25:54,435 --> 00:25:57,869
- Stop talking and just grab them.
- Sorry, Ji Hoon.

376
00:25:58,806 --> 00:26:00,631
I don't think I can do this, Ji Hoon.

377
00:26:00,632 --> 00:26:02,360
I don't think I can do this, Ji Hoon.

378
00:26:07,585 --> 00:26:09,666
I really am sorry, but I can't do it.

379
00:26:09,667 --> 00:26:13,064
Wow, I can't do this.
I can't even grab a single one.

380
00:26:13,785 --> 00:26:15,678
I can't even grab a single one.

381

- Sorry, what I did was wrong.

Hello, we're here hoping to help
my big brother come to his senses.

389
00:26:48,089 --> 00:26:53,772
This place is a very well-known place
in all of Youngchun.

[Youngchun's claim to fame-

follow me and I'll show you what to do.

- Are you our guide? You're so pretty.
- Yes, I am and please follow me.

[Off to make their wish.]

396
00:27:13,865 --> 00:27:20,730
If the stone feels heavier after you make
your wish than it did before

397
00:27:20,731 --> 00:27:22,745
then the saying goes that your wish
is going to come true.

- Okay.

Don't wish for your
foolish investment ideas to come true.

400

make up for all the losses that I've suffered.

to see how heavy it is.

421
00:28:56,556 --> 00:28:58,984
Just try lifting it.
It weighs 10kg, so there's some weight.

422
00:28:58,985 --> 00:29:01,780
So you know how heavy it is.
Now make a heartfelt wish.

Are you going to win today?

451

This is something that can be
verified in a few hours

452

so we can use this to determine
if this place really is for real.

It'll tell us if you can earn your money,
and if my business will succeed.

That has a nice ring to it.

482
00:32:12,521 --> 00:32:14,911
Wow, how far does this go?

483
00:32:14,912 --> 00:32:19,686
[A forest of wild strawberries.
This is heaven!]

484
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:23,605
The experience that you'll be
doing here is...

485
00:32:23,897 --> 00:32:27,263
- It's Ice Wild Strawberries.
- What's ice wild strawberries?

486
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:32,171
We have hidden strawberries containing ice
throughout this field.

487
00:32:32,172 --> 00:32:36,955
You have to find those blocks of ice
and extract the strawberries just as is.

488
00:32:36,956 --> 00:32:41,757
[Find the blocks of ice and extract
the berries in their original form and shape.]

489
00:32:41,758 --> 00:32:44,810
[Strawberry rescue mission- Start.]

490
00:32:45,581 --> 00:32:48,130
- I'm putting all my faith in you, Jong Kook.
- Why are you putting all your faith in me?

491
00:32:48,618 --> 00:32:51,243
- You have to look for it too.
- I am looking for it.

492
00:32:51,244 --> 00:32:53,494
You're such a city girl.

493
00:32:53,495 --> 00:32:55,095
She's driving me crazy with that.

494
00:32:55,819 --> 00:32:57,890
Wow, this really is driving me crazy.

495
00:32:57,891 --> 00:32:59,789
[Find the ice, then pop a berry in his mouth.]

496
00:32:59,790 --> 00:33:01,648
Let me know if you find any.

497
00:33:03,597 --> 00:33:05,579
Ma'am, where's the ice?

498
00:33:08,237 --> 00:33:11,811
[The Ghana boy gets
a helpful hint from the worker.]

499
00:33:14,884 --> 00:33:18,810
I found it!

500
00:33:19,712 --> 00:33:23,029
[Still the Reaction Duo!]

501
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:26,727
- I found it!
- Otswiri is the best!

502
00:33:28,325 --> 00:33:31,762
- That's huge!
- What the heck is this!

503
00:33:31,763 --> 00:33:34,045
[Rescue the strawberry from the ice block!]

504
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:36,677
- Did you find one?
- I found one!

505
00:33:36,678 --> 00:33:42,060
[The other teams soon finds
their own blocks of ice.]

506
00:33:42,061 --> 00:33:44,003
- It's over there.
- Hang on.

507
00:33:44,809 --> 00:33:47,554
[Much bigger than they had anticipated.]

508
00:33:49,218 --> 00:33:50,870
What are you two doing?

509
00:33:51,021 --> 00:33:54,114
[Unexpected hammering
out on the strawberry field.]

510
00:33:57,002 --> 00:34:00,130
[Extract the three strawberries from
the ice block without mangling them.]

511
00:34:01,421 --> 00:34:03,697
[A frost shower in the middle of the summer.]

512
00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:06,734
Yes, I'll start using it.

513
00:34:07,412 --> 00:34:09,395
- Be careful.
- Okay.

514
00:34:09,396 --> 00:34:11,241
Are you worrying for me?

515
00:34:11,902 --> 00:34:13,730
Don't fall for her spell.

516
00:34:16,826 --> 00:34:20,173
- Make sure not to mangle the berries.
- You have to chip away at it carefully.

517
00:34:20,174 --> 00:34:22,086
- Okay, that's good.
- Okay, let me see.

518
00:34:22,796 --> 00:34:25,353
There has to be a way
to split this in one chunk.

519
00:34:26,422 --> 00:34:31,015
[Kkuk launches his surgical skills.]

520
00:34:31,852 --> 00:34:37,145
[Wild strawberry... I will rescue you.]

521
00:34:40,332 --> 00:34:41,910
You did it, Jong Kook.

522
00:34:45,503 --> 00:34:47,902
- Look, here's another one.
- You have to find a method to doing this.

523
00:34:49,303 --> 00:34:50,512
Okay!

524
00:34:50,513 --> 00:34:52,424
- Look at this.
- Did you get it?

525
00:34:53,374 --> 00:34:55,042
Chip it off very carefully.

526
00:34:57,758 --> 00:35:00,580
- Did you get it?
- We have to melt away the rest.

527
00:35:00,581 --> 00:35:02,432
[Must carefully melt the surrounding ice away
as not to mangle the fragile berry.]

528
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:04,506
- Put it in your mouth.
- You want me to put it in my mouth?

529
00:35:04,507 --> 00:35:06,404
Put it in your mouth and melt it.

530
00:35:06,405 --> 00:35:08,578
There you go.
Melt the ice.

531
00:35:09,174 --> 00:35:11,661
You're doing good.
Okay, that's good.

532
00:35:18,506 --> 00:35:20,687
Hey, why are you guys
shaking the table so much?

533
00:35:20,688 --> 00:35:22,214
[The shaking force of the Tourist Couple.]

534
00:35:24,781 --> 00:35:28,747
[Strawberry surgical rescue
isn't as easy as he thought.]

535
00:35:30,291 --> 00:35:33,626
[But even more difficult is
the silkworm moving mission.]

536
00:35:34,062 --> 00:35:36,699
Was that your first one?

537
00:35:38,042 --> 00:35:42,501
[Jae Suk has to move all ten purple
silkworms while Ji Hoon hangs on the bar.]

538
00:35:43,409 --> 00:35:46,003
- Ugh, I don't think I can do this.
- You have to grab it!

539
00:35:46,004 --> 00:35:48,487
Ugh, seriously!

540
00:35:55,932 --> 00:35:57,536
That's cheating.

541
00:35:58,824 --> 00:36:01,555
[As if he was waiting for that comment.]

542
00:36:01,619 --> 00:36:04,386
- Jae Suk, let's trade off.
- What?

543
00:36:05,356 --> 00:36:07,484
What are you doing?

544
00:36:07,485 --> 00:36:09,128
You give it a try.

545
00:36:10,884 --> 00:36:12,374
Ugh, seriously.

546
00:36:12,375 --> 00:36:15,055
[Next up is,
The Client and Troubleshooter Team.]

547
00:36:15,056 --> 00:36:19,991
[We need to focus on
our secret mission first...]

548
00:36:19,992 --> 00:36:22,563
[Those silkworms are so scary...]

549
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:24,436
Okay, go on up there.

550
00:36:24,907 --> 00:36:28,301
- I really don't think I can last long.
- You have to stay up there.

551
00:36:35,175 --> 00:36:41,149
[Up... and back down.]

552
00:36:43,721 --> 00:36:45,966
[Unbelievable.]

553
00:36:46,378 --> 00:36:48,166
One look, and I knew he was done.

554
00:36:48,167 --> 00:36:49,932
I'll do that.

555
00:36:49,933 --> 00:36:53,511
I knew that he was done already.
Okay, Bo Min and Sung Gyun.

556
00:36:54,250 --> 00:36:57,247
[First Anniversary Couple's turn.]

557
00:36:57,946 --> 00:36:59,667
[Just then!]

558
00:36:59,668 --> 00:37:03,836
[Ji Sung targets Sung Hyun's name tag.]

559
00:37:04,912 --> 00:37:07,839
[Casually steps behind Sung Hyun's name tag.]

560
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:10,461
[Checks out his surroundings...]

561
00:37:11,722 --> 00:37:13,811
[While everyone's looking elsewhere.]

562
00:37:15,083 --> 00:37:18,563
[Target locked.]

563
00:37:23,687 --> 00:37:26,016
[As Sung Hyun tries to move...]

564
00:37:30,711 --> 00:37:32,016
It's on crooked.

565
00:37:32,953 --> 00:37:35,179
[Very bold move!]

566
00:37:44,510 --> 00:37:49,775
[But, just then!]

567
00:37:51,533 --> 00:37:56,641
[Ji Hoon sees what Ji Sung is doing!]

568
00:37:56,642 --> 00:38:01,185
[Will this be the end to
their secret mission?]

569
00:38:06,565 --> 00:38:09,596
[Ji Hoon gets distracted by Bo Mi's screams.]

570
00:38:09,597 --> 00:38:11,816
That's not the voice of a girl group member.

571
00:38:11,817 --> 00:38:14,208
I'm just not used to this.

572
00:38:14,209 --> 00:38:16,423
[Ji Hoon fortunately doesn't seem to
notice anything amiss.]

573
00:38:16,424 --> 00:38:18,704
[Almost loses it.]

574
00:38:19,111 --> 00:38:22,088
[Please be more careful, Ji Hoon!]

575
00:38:24,155 --> 00:38:28,629
[First Anniversary Couple makes
their first attempt at the mission.]

576
00:38:31,195 --> 00:38:33,703
It's harder than you thought,
isn't it, Sung Hyun?

577
00:38:34,653 --> 00:38:36,641
Look at how Sung Hyun's body is shaking.

578
00:38:36,642 --> 00:38:38,861
- Look at him shaking.
- This is really hard.

579
00:38:38,862 --> 00:38:41,450
I don't know, Sung Hyun.
I don't think I can do this.

580
00:38:46,291 --> 00:38:48,259
What's that noise you're making, Bo Mi?

581
00:38:50,486 --> 00:38:53,904
[Keeps dropping whatever she
manages to grab.]

582
00:38:53,905 --> 00:38:55,715
I'm sorry, but there are so many of them.

583
00:38:56,913 --> 00:38:58,835
Oh my goodness!

584
00:38:59,185 --> 00:39:01,835
I'm sorry, Sung Hyun.
Come on!

585
00:39:05,588 --> 00:39:07,280
Hang on just a little bit longer.

586
00:39:09,463 --> 00:39:11,405
She keeps grabbing it then dropping it.

587
00:39:11,406 --> 00:39:13,773
Do they feel hot or something?

588
00:39:14,281 --> 00:39:16,384
Sung Hyun...

589
00:39:16,385 --> 00:39:19,143
[She just wants you to come back down.]

590
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:24,777
This isn't going to do.
You're not going to get this done today.

591
00:39:24,778 --> 00:39:27,010
Why do you keep grabbing it,
and then dropping it back down?

592
00:39:27,011 --> 00:39:29,306
[Will they be able to succeed
before the day is over?]

593
00:39:30,771 --> 00:39:34,009
If any of you guys want to go eat, then go.
I think we're going to be here a while.

594
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:36,477
You have to do it quickly.
You know that, right, Ji Hoon?

595
00:39:37,395 --> 00:39:39,696
[I will to rip off Jae Suk's name tag.]

596
00:39:41,624 --> 00:39:43,631
[Best Looking Couple's attempt.]

597
00:39:43,632 --> 00:39:45,079
Ji Hoon.

598
00:39:45,867 --> 00:39:48,198
- You see now how hard it was for me, right?
- Hurry up.

599
00:39:48,199 --> 00:39:51,413
Get it all in one shot.

600
00:39:52,406 --> 00:39:55,557
[Working at top speed!
Ji Hoon already has five in his hand!]

601
00:39:57,119 --> 00:40:00,236
[They'll definitely succeed
the mission at this rate!]

602
00:40:00,891 --> 00:40:05,109
[We have to rip off Jae Suk's name tag...]

603
00:40:05,110 --> 00:40:09,893
[We can't let it keep going like this...]

604
00:40:20,479 --> 00:40:22,774
He almost had it.

605
00:40:22,775 --> 00:40:24,636
[Kwang Soo puts his life on the line to
interfere for his own secret mission.]

606
00:40:25,997 --> 00:40:28,437
What do you think you're doing?

607
00:40:30,691 --> 00:40:32,498
[Ji Hoon explodes.]

608
00:40:32,499 --> 00:40:34,724
- What do you think you're doing?
- He had like eight in his hand.

609
00:40:37,222 --> 00:40:39,487
- You know that's how Kwang Soo is.
- How could you have kicked me like that?

610
00:40:39,488 --> 00:40:42,998
[Tries to avoid their suspicion by saying
that's how Kwang Soo normally acts.]

611
00:40:42,999 --> 00:40:45,504
- That's not cheating.
- Ah, you can do that?

612
00:40:47,034 --> 00:40:49,654
- I almost had it.
- You were doing such a good job!

613
00:40:49,655 --> 00:40:51,207
[Good job, Kwang Soo.]

614
00:40:51,208 --> 00:40:54,435
- You should try hanging on the bar, Bo Mi.
- Yes, I think you're right.

615
00:40:54,436 --> 00:40:56,597
[Bo Mi tries her hand at hanging off the bar.]

616
00:40:56,598 --> 00:40:59,063
- We'll lift you up there.
- You won't be able to lift me.

617
00:40:59,657 --> 00:41:01,473
- You can step on me to get up there.
- No, that's okay, Kwang Soo.

618
00:41:01,474 --> 00:41:03,186
- No, it's okay.
- Okay, fine.

619
00:41:05,903 --> 00:41:07,581
What the heck?
What are you doing?

620
00:41:08,058 --> 00:41:09,948
What are these guys doing?

621
00:41:09,949 --> 00:41:11,535
[Sweet revenge!]

622
00:41:12,322 --> 00:41:14,367
Why are you stepping on my back?

623
00:41:14,368 --> 00:41:17,305
[While secret Client, Kwang Soo,
is being abused by others...]

624
00:41:22,053 --> 00:41:24,797
Wait, so we have to beat 180kg?

625
00:41:24,798 --> 00:41:26,480
How much do you weigh, Ji Hyo?

626
00:41:26,481 --> 00:41:28,600
Since Ji Hyo weighs 65kg...

627
00:41:29,489 --> 00:41:32,575
She's so skinny!
What are you saying?

628
00:41:32,576 --> 00:41:34,420
- This won't show my weight, will it
- You and I can do it together.

629
00:41:34,421 --> 00:41:37,884
[Use the see-saw to lift the boulder off
the ground to succeed the mission.]

630
00:41:38,268 --> 00:41:41,851
- I weigh about 71kg.
- Both of us combined weighs less than 150kg.

631
00:41:43,015 --> 00:41:45,097
[Not even budging.]

632
00:41:45,132 --> 00:41:49,632
[With Ji Hyo also on the seesaw...]

633
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:56,066
[Success!]

634
00:41:57,342 --> 00:42:00,690
- Ji Hyo did it.
- Ji Hyo really does weigh 65kg.

635
00:42:00,691 --> 00:42:03,456
- She really does weigh 65kg.
- We sank right down to the ground.

636
00:42:03,457 --> 00:42:06,310
- Where are we going to find 60kg?
- Let's start looking around.

637
00:42:07,324 --> 00:42:10,370
[Must do what they can to find something
heavy on their own.]

638
00:42:10,371 --> 00:42:13,193
This would be over already
if Jong Kook were here.

639
00:42:13,194 --> 00:42:15,042
[Eye for an eye, rock for a rock!]

640
00:42:15,604 --> 00:42:17,606
Help me lift this.

641
00:42:21,385 --> 00:42:25,257
Ma'am, do you by any chance have
any sacks of rice in here?

642
00:42:25,258 --> 00:42:27,336
- Can we borrow this?
- How much does this weigh?

643
00:42:27,337 --> 00:42:29,174
[Blank Ji borrows a sack of rice
from the restaurant owner.]

644
00:42:29,175 --> 00:42:31,275
This doesn't weigh 20kg.
It maybe weighs about 15kg.

645
00:42:31,276 --> 00:42:33,940
Suk Jin, I found something that may work.

646
00:42:35,308 --> 00:42:38,381
- Wow, that's awesome.
- Okay, put it on here.

647
00:42:38,382 --> 00:42:41,405
See? You got yourself a smart little sister.

648
00:42:41,406 --> 00:42:43,091
You really are the best.

649
00:42:43,092 --> 00:42:44,631
Okay, let's go.

650
00:42:46,349 --> 00:42:49,192
- Be careful not to hurt your back.
- Can you help me with this?

651
00:42:49,193 --> 00:42:50,500
[Ambitious Yu Ram goes after a huge rock.]

652
00:42:50,501 --> 00:42:53,034
- Can you get that?
- One, two, three.

653
00:42:58,234 --> 00:42:59,849
Are you okay?

654
00:42:59,850 --> 00:43:04,097
[Who will be the first to bring back 180kg?]

655
00:43:07,944 --> 00:43:10,250
[Yu Ram isn't even making a difference.]

656
00:43:12,097 --> 00:43:13,963
[Gary steps up to join Yu Ram.]

657
00:43:16,048 --> 00:43:19,298
[Oh?]

658
00:43:19,299 --> 00:43:23,020
[It's going down!]

659
00:43:24,039 --> 00:43:25,734
Is this good?

660
00:43:26,385 --> 00:43:29,394
[A sign signaling their success!]

661
00:43:30,362 --> 00:43:33,728
[Billiards Couple succeeds
the Stone Grandmother mission.]

662
00:43:34,563 --> 00:43:37,264
Yu Ram, you're so strong!

663
00:43:37,265 --> 00:43:38,986
Hey, Yu Ram.

664
00:43:40,367 --> 00:43:44,299
[Will Stone Grandmother really grant her
the wish of winning today's race?]

665
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:46,964
[Do the best you can do.]

666
00:43:47,388 --> 00:43:51,232
- Here's your next tour location.
- Is it a restaurant tour?

667
00:43:55,075 --> 00:43:59,375
[Restaurant tour-
Beef stew and Dumplings.]

668
00:43:59,854 --> 00:44:01,114
- I want the stew.
- The stew?

669
00:44:01,115 --> 00:44:03,739
You had a burger, kimbap,
and a pastry earlier.

670
00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:04,815
- You want to eat again?
- Yes.

671
00:44:04,816 --> 00:44:06,908
Okay, let's go.

672
00:44:07,380 --> 00:44:09,478
[Rushes off before the other team.]

673
00:44:10,710 --> 00:44:13,201
[The wild strawberry challenge teams
are still busy hammering away.]

674
00:44:13,202 --> 00:44:16,502
[Must extract all three berries from the ice
to get the clear to go to the next location.]

675
00:44:16,503 --> 00:44:18,110
You got it!

676
00:44:20,145 --> 00:44:22,675
[The Tour Couple succeeds in extracting
their second berry from the ice.]

677
00:44:22,676 --> 00:44:25,002
- I got it.
- I got it!

678
00:44:25,512 --> 00:44:27,954
[Event Couple soon thereafter
extracts their second berry as well.]

679
00:44:28,642 --> 00:44:30,388
[On the other hand...]

680
00:44:30,389 --> 00:44:32,853
We're really bad at this, aren't we?

681
00:44:34,308 --> 00:44:35,667
Melt it.

682
00:44:35,668 --> 00:44:37,281
[Kyung Hwan pops another
iced berry in his mouth.]

683
00:44:39,391 --> 00:44:42,598
[Just then...]

684
00:44:42,599 --> 00:44:44,532
It's perfect!

685
00:44:45,598 --> 00:44:48,283
[Otswiri gets his third berry from the ice.]

686
00:44:49,099 --> 00:44:52,940
[Will he melt it... or will he carry it?]

687
00:44:52,941 --> 00:44:55,013
You have to melt it completely.

688
00:44:57,477 --> 00:45:00,882
[Is the Tourist Couple first to succeed?]

689
00:45:03,915 --> 00:45:07,230
[Tourist Couple clears
their wild strawberry mission.]

690
00:45:08,082 --> 00:45:10,579

00:45:12,429 --> 00:45:15,488
[As for Kyung Hwan's
melted wild strawberry...]

692
00:45:19,465 --> 00:45:22,014
[Event Couple is also cleared
to go off to their next location.]

693
00:45:23,586 --> 00:45:25,847
I want to mention that Na Eun is
making ice sculptures right now.

694
00:45:27,722 --> 00:45:33,663
[Who cares about the mission?
I'm going to follow my artistic desires.]

695
00:45:36,228 --> 00:45:38,987
- Let's go with the beef stew.
- Beef stew?

696
00:45:39,438 --> 00:45:41,555
- We want the roasted dumplings.
- Roasted dumplings.

697
00:45:41,672 --> 00:45:45,039
They'll take the roasted dumplings,
and we'll take the beef stew!

698
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:48,584
Since you can't drive ourselves,
do you want to wait for the other team?

699
00:45:48,585 --> 00:45:52,670
I heard that the dumplings are amazing.
We need to go for the dumplings, Ha Ha.

700
00:45:53,220 --> 00:45:56,340
- Come on, let's go for the dumplings.

- Let's just stick together to the end.
- I have a soft spot for these guys now.

703
00:46:02,574 --> 00:46:07,132
- We keep going everywhere together.
- It makes me sad to have them apart from us.

704
00:46:09,282 --> 00:46:12,740
[The two teams ultimately decide to
go to the dumpling restaurant together.]

705
00:46:12,741 --> 00:46:16,338
- This looks so good in the picture.
- Roasted dumplings.

706
00:46:17,868 --> 00:46:21,110
[Excited at the prospect of eating good food.]

707
00:46:22,514 --> 00:46:25,084
City of stars, Youngchun.

708
00:46:26,166 --> 00:46:28,444
- Okay, I'll go up there again this time.
- Okay, I'll try it again.

709
00:46:28,445 --> 00:46:29,668
[Meanwhile, none of the teams have
yet to succeed the silkworm farm mission.]

710
00:46:29,703 --> 00:46:31,549
 [When are we ever going to
rip off Jae Suk's name tag?]

711
00:46:34,866 --> 00:46:37,743
[Best Looking Couple makes
another attempt.]

712
00:46:39,227 --> 00:46:43,166
[Smart Ji Hoon- Gets the branches
out of the way to get to the worms.]

713
00:46:47,622 --> 00:46:49,688
Seven, eight... two more.

714
00:46:49,689 --> 00:46:51,205
[What are we going to do?]

715
00:46:54,271 --> 00:46:57,788
[If they clear the mission and leave,
then they won't be able to get Jae Suk.]

716
00:46:58,837 --> 00:47:00,676
Ten.
Jae Suk, I got them all.

717
00:47:01,779 --> 00:47:03,716
Jae Suk, I got them all.

718
00:47:09,068 --> 00:47:12,224
[Ultimate physical interference-
Climbing Jae Suk like a bug on a dead tree.]

719
00:47:18,567 --> 00:47:20,711
[On my, why are you
straightening out your legs?]

720
00:47:21,647 --> 00:47:23,900
- What are you doing?
- He fell off the bar!

721
00:47:23,901 --> 00:47:25,957
[Grasshopper falls off the bar from
Giraffe's ambush kissing attack.]

722
00:47:25,958 --> 00:47:27,723
He fell off the bar!

723
00:47:27,724 --> 00:47:29,829
[But we were so close!]

724
00:47:29,830 --> 00:47:31,991
Why did you climb up there to kiss me?

725
00:47:31,992 --> 00:47:33,917
That was a total accident.

726
00:47:33,918 --> 00:47:36,769
- Ugh, seriously.
- Okay, let's do it this time for real.

727
00:47:36,770 --> 00:47:38,640
Let's play it clean from now on.

728
00:47:38,641 --> 00:47:40,714
He had it all.

729
00:47:41,731 --> 00:47:43,917
[But when are we going to
rip off Jae Suk's name tag?]

730
00:47:43,918 --> 00:47:46,136
Okay, Bo Mi and Sung Hyun's turn.

731
00:47:46,137 --> 00:47:48,918
[Back to the adorable
First Anniversary couple.]

732
00:47:48,919 --> 00:47:51,986
Sung Hyun looks really angry right now.

733
00:47:53,730 --> 00:47:55,521
I really have lost a lot of my strength.
This is going to be trouble.

734
00:47:57,706 --> 00:47:59,395
She's doing it!

735
00:47:59,396 --> 00:48:01,917
[Bo Mi's different!]

736
00:48:05,415 --> 00:48:08,434
[We haven't ripped off
Bo Mi's name tag yet either...]

737
00:48:08,435 --> 00:48:10,204
Her voice really is horse.

738
00:48:10,824 --> 00:48:15,247
- How many do we have, Sung Hyun?
- How would I know how many you have?

739
00:48:16,728 --> 00:48:21,593
I'll count what I have so far.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven!

740
00:48:22,298 --> 00:48:25,789
[Seven are moved already!
Three more, and they clear the mission!]

741
00:48:26,019 --> 00:48:27,474
- Eight.
- Eight.

742
00:48:27,475 --> 00:48:29,154
Sung Hyun!

743
00:48:32,650 --> 00:48:34,232
There's something on your hand, Bo Mi.

744
00:48:35,510 --> 00:48:36,544
Nine!

745
00:48:36,545 --> 00:48:39,013
Hang on, Sung Hyun.

746
00:48:39,014 --> 00:48:41,133
[Only one more left to go...]

747
00:48:42,868 --> 00:48:48,519
[Will Bo Mi be able to pull it off?]

748
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:49,897
Ten!

749
00:48:50,910 --> 00:48:54,036
[Succeeds in moving ten purple worms.]

750
00:48:56,215 --> 00:48:58,478
Good job.

751
00:48:59,390 --> 00:49:01,903
[We're ruined...]

752
00:49:02,312 --> 00:49:05,903
- Okay, bye. Bye, Bo Mi and Sung Hyun.
- Good luck.

753
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:10,901
- What should we pick?
- What would you like, Sung Hyun?

754
00:49:10,902 --> 00:49:12,807
Should we both say it on the
count of three?

755
00:49:12,808 --> 00:49:14,111
One, two, three.

756
00:49:14,112 --> 00:49:15,351
- Beef stew.
- Beef stew.

757
00:49:17,615 --> 00:49:19,546
- I did good, right?
- Yeah, you did really good.

758
00:49:19,547 --> 00:49:22,393
[Off to the beef stew restaurant!]

759
00:49:23,818 --> 00:49:26,107
Jae Suk is looking really tired right now.

760
00:49:26,108 --> 00:49:28,379
[Best Looking Couple's thirteenth attempt.]

761
00:49:28,890 --> 00:49:30,426
Only two more left to go.

762
00:49:30,427 --> 00:49:31,767
[Ji Hoon's now best friends
with the silkworms.]

763
00:49:35,969 --> 00:49:39,472
[All he has left to do is to count the worms
to verify that he has all ten.]

764
00:49:40,726 --> 00:49:42,685
[No, we can't let this happen...]

765
00:49:42,686 --> 00:49:44,374
Eight, nine, ten.

766
00:49:47,486 --> 00:49:50,275
[Best Looking Couple succeeds in
getting their ten silkworms.]

767
00:49:52,646 --> 00:49:54,328
Okay, we're going to take off now.

768
00:49:55,364 --> 00:49:59,351
[They really must rip off
Jae Suk's name tag right now...]

769
00:49:59,827 --> 00:50:01,244
We're going to get going.

770
00:50:02,522 --> 00:50:04,872
<i>- You have to take care of Jae Suk.
- Okay.</i>

771
00:50:07,417 --> 00:50:09,659
- Bye.
- Ugh, I just want to...

772
00:50:10,218 --> 00:50:11,970
Ugh, I just want to...

773
00:50:12,676 --> 00:50:14,948
Ugh, I just want to rip off your name tag!

774
00:50:14,949 --> 00:50:17,125
- I just want to rip off your name tag.
- I'm so tired right now.

775
00:50:17,126 --> 00:50:20,190
[Ji Sung... you're awesome!]

776
00:50:21,132 --> 00:50:23,804
[Ji Sung's perfect act of aggravation.]

777
00:50:23,805 --> 00:50:25,826
[Target- Yoo Jae Suk.
Secret revenge- Success.]

778
00:50:25,827 --> 00:50:27,108
Ji Sung.

779
00:50:29,386 --> 00:50:31,153
- Seriously.
- Ji Sung.

780
00:50:32,958 --> 00:50:35,565
[Ji Hoon stops Ji Sung in his tracks.]

781
00:50:35,566 --> 00:50:39,057
[Has Ji Hoon really caught them
in their act this time?]

782
00:50:39,058 --> 00:50:41,744
Ji Sung, good luck finishing the mission.

783
00:50:42,931 --> 00:50:44,600
Good luck finishing the mission.

784
00:50:46,223 --> 00:50:49,329
[Notices nothing!
Ji Hoon leaves with a cheerful goodbye.]

785
00:50:50,964 --> 00:50:55,643
[Whew... we got away with it!]

786
00:50:55,644 --> 00:50:56,843
Let's go.

787
00:50:59,332 --> 00:51:02,709
[With everyone now gone,
no more reason to waste any more time.]

788
00:51:05,310 --> 00:51:09,119
[They must hurry if they're to rip off
everyone's name tags before the tour is over!]

789
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:11,561
- Eight!
- Take your time!

790
00:51:14,881 --> 00:51:18,138
Are you really taking your time
just because I tell you to?

791
00:51:18,139 --> 00:51:19,685
Hurry up!

792
00:51:24,365 --> 00:51:27,879
[Very loudly succeeds in getting their ten.]

793
00:51:28,463 --> 00:51:29,846
- Good job.
- We did it.

794
00:51:31,455 --> 00:51:34,095
How many have you gotten so far?

795
00:51:34,096 --> 00:51:37,176
[How many members have they succeeded
in getting their revenge on so far?]

796
00:51:37,177 --> 00:51:40,868
[Otswiri, Ji Hoon, Jong kook,
Sung Hyun, Jae Suk- A total of five.]

797
00:51:40,869 --> 00:51:42,515
I only got Ji Hoon.

798
00:51:43,223 --> 00:51:46,093
We really have to be careful now because
a lot of them have seen us do it.

799
00:51:46,094 --> 00:51:48,540
- Okay, I'll be more careful.
- Just follow my orders.

800
00:51:48,541 --> 00:51:50,458
- They might get suspicious otherwise.
- No, I don't want to.

801
00:51:50,459 --> 00:51:54,742
But they might get suspicious.
Only do it when I give you the signal.

802
00:51:54,743 --> 00:51:57,052
How are we going to do it
if I followed your orders?

803
00:51:57,053 --> 00:51:59,998
I'll let you know
when I think the moment is right.

804
00:52:01,358 --> 00:52:04,517
- Let's just go with my plan.
- Okay.

805
00:52:12,398 --> 00:52:15,984
[Off to the dumpling restaurant
to find new targets.]

806
00:52:16,431 --> 00:52:20,721
If what I'm doing looks suspicious,
then give me a sign like this.

807
00:52:20,722 --> 00:52:22,529
- This sign is to tell me to stop.
- Okay.

808
00:52:22,530 --> 00:52:24,693
But someone could see me doing this.

809
00:52:25,466 --> 00:52:28,438
[Well... that's true.]

810
00:52:29,565 --> 00:52:32,502
[Hanwoo restaurant.]

811
00:52:35,002 --> 00:52:37,390
- Are you enjoying your Youngchun Tour?
- Yes.

812
00:52:37,391 --> 00:52:41,753
Welcome to the second course of your tour,
The Eatery Course.

813
00:52:41,754 --> 00:52:43,589
[Second course of their tour- Beef Stew.]

814
00:52:43,590 --> 00:52:45,493
- Just relax and enjoy your meal.
- Really?

815
00:52:45,494 --> 00:52:48,453
- Seriously?
- Youngchun is famous for their hanwoo beef.

816
00:52:48,837 --> 00:52:52,074
They are known for their special
beef stew dish.

817
00:52:52,075 --> 00:52:54,994
- You're here because you chose the beef stew.
- Yes.

818
00:52:59,758 --> 00:53:04,974
[Youngchun's hanwoo... sizzles on the grill.]

819
00:53:04,975 --> 00:53:07,767
Order as much as you'd like for now.

820
00:53:07,768 --> 00:53:09,786
Really?
We can eat whatever we want?

821
00:53:09,787 --> 00:53:14,646
[Grateful... yet somehow nervous too.]

822
00:53:14,647 --> 00:53:17,481
First, we'll take three orders
of the filet to go.

823
00:53:19,177 --> 00:53:21,180
We can do that?
You're saying we can get whatever?

824
00:53:21,181 --> 00:53:23,985
You're saying we really van get whatever?
Even the filet?

825
00:53:23,986 --> 00:53:27,816
You can order whatever you'd like,
and we'll pay for the check.

826
00:53:29,968 --> 00:53:32,457
- Two orders of the filet and two stews?
- Yes.

827
00:53:32,458 --> 00:53:35,743
Look at the expression on Bo Mi's face.
She's wondering why you're being so nice.

828
00:53:36,506 --> 00:53:38,554
You're being way too nice today.

829
00:53:38,555 --> 00:53:40,522
You're usually not this nice.

830
00:53:40,861 --> 00:53:43,541
[Billiards Couple also chose
the beef stew for their Eatery Course.]

831
00:53:43,542 --> 00:53:46,314
Let's order the most
expensive thing on the menu.

832
00:53:46,814 --> 00:53:48,906
Two orders of the filet,
and an order of the stew.

833
00:53:48,907 --> 00:53:51,531
Okay, let's order that.
Grandmother will make my wishes come true.

834
00:53:52,610 --> 00:53:54,579
- Come in, Na Eun.
- Okay.

835
00:53:54,580 --> 00:53:55,871
[Blind Date Couple also
joins the beef stew gang.]

836
00:53:55,872 --> 00:53:59,057
Morning, day, or night,
Na Eun's always so pretty.

837
00:53:59,058 --> 00:54:01,792
You're seriously going to drive me crazy
with how pretty you are.

838
00:54:02,879 --> 00:54:07,117
Yu Ram is pretty during day and night,
but she's a little scary in the morning.

839
00:54:08,295 --> 00:54:11,036
Yu Ram is pretty again
now that it's daytime.

840
00:54:11,037 --> 00:54:13,942
I was really surprised when I saw
how she looked this morning.

841
00:54:13,943 --> 00:54:16,044
I want the filet and the beef stew.

842
00:54:16,326 --> 00:54:19,062
[Two orders each of the filet and the stew.]

843
00:54:19,063 --> 00:54:20,962
We'll also get an order of the steak tartar.

844
00:54:20,963 --> 00:54:23,207
Why are you eating so much
so early in the day?

845
00:54:23,208 --> 00:54:25,623
[Everyone completes submitting
their orders.]

846
00:54:25,624 --> 00:54:29,060
Okay, we will now start your mission.
Please get up from your seats.

847
00:54:29,095 --> 00:54:33,451
[Before we even get to eat?]

848
00:54:33,452 --> 00:54:35,789
We're going to do your mission
while the food is being prepared.

849
00:54:36,405 --> 00:54:40,081
[A simple mission before the food
is brought out to the table.]

850
00:54:40,971 --> 00:54:43,397
[We'll see you in a little bit.]

851
00:54:44,518 --> 00:54:49,801
[Steps out of the restaurant...
and what do they see?]

852
00:54:49,802 --> 00:54:52,386
- Yu Ram, wait for me.
- Hurry up.

853
00:54:52,387 --> 00:54:54,612
[Once the bus moves out of their way...]

854
00:54:58,034 --> 00:55:00,780
[Rodeo]

855
00:55:01,942 --> 00:55:04,082
[If you want the hanwoo meal,
then you need to ride me first!]

856
00:55:07,799 --> 00:55:09,092
That's really hard.

857
00:55:09,093 --> 00:55:12,957
What did I tell all of you earlier?
Youngchun is famous for their hanwoo.

858
00:55:12,958 --> 00:55:15,153
That's why we have prepared
this rodeo game for you.

859
00:55:15,154 --> 00:55:17,184
- I've never done this before.
- It's not easy.

860
00:55:17,185 --> 00:55:19,630
It's going to be a game of trust.

861
00:55:19,631 --> 00:55:23,769
Even if Na Eun doesn't do a very good job,
Jong Kook can make up for the remainder.

862
00:55:23,770 --> 00:55:25,448
So this is going to be up to the men.

863
00:55:27,125 --> 00:55:33,584
Yoo Jae Suk and Joo Ji Hoon ordered two orders
of the filet and an order of the stew, right?

864
00:55:33,585 --> 00:55:37,594
- The total cost of your meal is...
- What the heck is this?

865
00:55:37,595 --> 00:55:41,163
[The requirement of the mission is related
to the cost of their meals.]

866
00:55:41,164 --> 00:55:43,463
You even ordered the steak tartar.

867
00:55:43,464 --> 00:55:49,815
[Best Looking Couple-
Total cost of the meal is 56,000 won.]

868
00:55:49,816 --> 00:55:52,859
[One second per 1,000 won.
Best Looking Couple- 56 seconds.]

869
00:55:52,860 --> 00:55:55,017
- Then we have 56 seconds too?
- Yes, your team also has 56 seconds.

870
00:55:55,018 --> 00:55:57,575
[First Anniversary Couple- 64 seconds.]

871
00:55:58,137 --> 00:56:01,284
We can all split the steak tartar,
so just give them 67 seconds.

872
00:56:01,985 --> 00:56:05,464
[Blind Date Couple- 67 seconds.]

873
00:56:05,465 --> 00:56:08,062
We'll go in the order of the team's arrival.

874
00:56:09,786 --> 00:56:12,728
- Ji Hoon, you take 30 seconds.
- Okay.

875
00:56:12,729 --> 00:56:15,492
[Best Looking Couple's Ji Hoon
to take the first turn.]

876
00:56:15,493 --> 00:56:20,966
Ji Hoon really hates to work out,
and he just likes to lay around at home.

877
00:56:20,967 --> 00:56:23,759
I lead the life of a man in his eighties.

878
00:56:27,521 --> 00:56:30,068
[The elder gets on top of the rodeo bull.]

879
00:56:30,069 --> 00:56:34,005
I can tell you from seeing him firsthand
that Ji Hoon only looks strong.

880
00:56:34,465 --> 00:56:37,128
[Total time for Best Looking Couple-
56 seconds.]

881
00:56:37,129 --> 00:56:38,747
Ready, set, go!

882
00:56:44,384 --> 00:56:47,557
[Dancing along with the bull.]

883
00:56:52,445 --> 00:56:56,102
[The elder gets the exercise
that his body isn't used to.]

884
00:56:57,046 --> 00:56:58,549
You're doing good.

885
00:57:07,424 --> 00:57:08,717
How many seconds was that?

886
00:57:08,718 --> 00:57:11,321
He lasted 13 seconds.

887
00:57:11,322 --> 00:57:14,124
How are we ever going to eat
by doing this?

888
00:57:14,884 --> 00:57:16,958
I'll just take care of it.

889
00:57:16,959 --> 00:57:19,927
You're fine, Ji Hoon.
That was good enough.

890
00:57:19,928 --> 00:57:21,174
How many seconds do I need to get?

891
00:57:21,175 --> 00:57:23,255
- You need to get 43 seconds.
- Okay.

892
00:57:23,256 --> 00:57:25,896
[Total of 56 seconds.
Jae Suk must stay on for 43 seconds.]

893
00:57:29,395 --> 00:57:31,105
[Pulls himself up in a single try.]

894
00:57:31,106 --> 00:57:33,465
- You saw that, didn't you?
- No, we didn't see anything.

895
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:36,313
- There's a skill to doing this.
- Sorry to say this, but I don't see it.

896
00:57:36,749 --> 00:57:40,568
It's because you guys don't have
the skills to pull this off, okay?

897
00:57:40,569 --> 00:57:45,490
You have to have the right skills for this.
I've done this quite a few times.

898
00:57:45,491 --> 00:57:47,626
- You have to stay on for 43 seconds.
- Okay.

899
00:57:47,627 --> 00:57:49,791
Ready, set, go.

900
00:57:59,068 --> 00:58:01,813
[Thanks for teaching us the skills.]

901
00:58:02,661 --> 00:58:05,941
[Falls off within the first second.]

902
00:58:06,890 --> 00:58:09,157
[Miserably fails the mission.]

903
00:58:09,611 --> 00:58:11,384
What was that?

904
00:58:12,912 --> 00:58:15,472
This thing rides differently
than what I'm used to.

905
00:58:16,842 --> 00:58:21,192
[We'll take it as you not having
any bull riding skills.]

906
00:58:21,193 --> 00:58:24,769
I'm used to it going side to side.
Why does this one go back and forth?

907
00:58:26,198 --> 00:58:27,665
Seriously.

908
00:58:28,703 --> 00:58:31,690
[I really want some beef stew.]

909
00:58:39,845 --> 00:58:42,209
- You can go on to the back.
- Are we the only ones here?

910
00:58:42,210 --> 00:58:44,181
Why isn't anyone else here?

911
00:58:44,182 --> 00:58:48,231
Welcome to the second course of
the One Day Tour, the Eatery Tour.

912
00:58:48,232 --> 00:58:52,998
- That looks so good.
- These dumplings are Youngchun's specialty.

913
00:58:53,361 --> 00:58:56,963
- You can start eating the dumplings...
- We can just start eating?

914
00:59:02,485 --> 00:59:04,596
[Yum!]

915
00:59:06,584 --> 00:59:09,167
[Keeping a constant lookout
for any newcomers.]

916
00:59:13,213 --> 00:59:16,923
I think this sitting position is going to
make our secret mission more difficult.

917
00:59:16,924 --> 00:59:18,484
When other teams start to come in here

918
00:59:18,485 --> 00:59:21,994
then we should stand up to greet them
and maybe while we're greeting each other...

919
00:59:22,193 --> 00:59:26,872
[Troubleshooter, Ji Sung's action plan-
Rip off the name tags during the greeting.]

920
00:59:26,873 --> 00:59:28,355
What do you think of that plan?

921
00:59:28,356 --> 00:59:30,345
Timing is very important.

922
00:59:30,346 --> 00:59:31,921
[Timing is of the essence.]

923
00:59:33,076 --> 00:59:35,642
- Let's go eat some dumplings!
- Let's eat some dumplings!

924
00:59:35,643 --> 00:59:37,754
<i>Let's eat some dumplings!</i>

925
00:59:40,344 --> 00:59:41,935
It's Suk Jin.

926
00:59:43,930 --> 00:59:45,967
It's Ji Hyo.
Hey, Suk Jin!

927
00:59:45,968 --> 00:59:49,700
[Suk Jin and Ji Hyo unknowingly roll into
the lion's den of secret revenge.]

928
00:59:52,338 --> 00:59:54,188
Are the dumplings any good?

929
00:59:57,850 --> 00:59:59,880
[Taking advantage of the greeting process
per Ji Sung's plan...]

930
00:59:59,881 --> 01:00:01,231
Can I have some?

931
01:00:01,931 --> 01:00:04,259
[Suk Jin's question scares him
off of his action plan.]

932
01:00:04,260 --> 01:00:05,493
Can I have some?

933
01:00:06,710 --> 01:00:09,427
- Is it good?
- It's really good.

934
01:00:10,215 --> 01:00:13,084
Let's just eat for now.

935
01:00:15,359 --> 01:00:17,755
I feel like there are so many
different games on Running Man.

936
01:00:17,756 --> 01:00:20,668
There are a lot of games that you never
even imagined existed.

937
01:00:20,669 --> 01:00:24,446
But why don't you play that
name tag elimination game anymore?

938
01:00:24,447 --> 01:00:28,373
But why don't you play that
name tag elimination game anymore?

939
01:00:28,374 --> 01:00:30,108
[Are you asking that question because...]

940
01:00:35,924 --> 01:00:40,508
[He just... rips it off.]

941
01:00:42,897 --> 01:00:46,647
[The Troubleshooter boldly ousts Ji Hyo.]

942
01:00:50,102 --> 01:00:52,614
First timers on our show can't beat us
when it comes to that game.

943
01:00:53,697 --> 01:00:55,625
Dong Hoon is here!

944
01:00:57,246 --> 01:01:00,784
[Victims of the secret mission just keep
rolling unsuspectingly into their lion's den.]

945
01:01:01,658 --> 01:01:03,355
Kwang Soo's here too.

946
01:01:03,356 --> 01:01:06,899
[Really glad that you're all here!]

947
01:01:09,340 --> 01:01:13,502
[The best prey that they could've asked for
on this Eatery Tour.]

948
01:01:13,503 --> 01:01:16,228
- Just enjoy your meal for now.
- Seriously?

949
01:01:16,229 --> 01:01:19,792
- Have a seat.
- Should we start our mission?

950
01:01:21,375 --> 01:01:24,422
[Rip it off right now.]

951
01:01:25,218 --> 01:01:27,371
[Okay, Ji Sung!]

952
01:01:29,619 --> 01:01:31,839
[Giraffe walks over to Fabien.]

953
01:01:32,828 --> 01:01:34,724
[His hand makes a move.]

954
01:01:37,976 --> 01:01:40,629
[There aren't any problems, are there?]

955
01:01:41,770 --> 01:01:44,238
[Boldly goes for it as if
it's something he does every day.]

956
01:01:49,358 --> 01:01:52,937
All 14 of their name tags have to be
ripped completely off their backs

957
01:01:52,938 --> 01:01:56,245
and reattached onto their backs.
Ripping it off halfway won't be accepted.

958
01:01:58,523 --> 01:02:00,767
<i>Ripping it off halfway won't be accepted.</i>

959
01:02:04,871 --> 01:02:08,076
[He's watching what you're doing!]

960
01:02:08,077 --> 01:02:09,559
What are you doing?

961
01:02:10,766 --> 01:02:12,620
No, it's nothing.

962
01:02:12,621 --> 01:02:14,881
[It's still attached to his back!]

963
01:02:18,335 --> 01:02:20,074
No, it's nothing.

964
01:02:24,055 --> 01:02:26,324
Let's just do our mission.
We want to do our mission.

965
01:02:27,630 --> 01:02:30,936
- Wow, look at the steam rising from it.
- This looks really hot.

966
01:02:32,861 --> 01:02:36,041
[Signaling that it's dangerous to
reattempt it now.]

967
01:02:39,036 --> 01:02:40,975
[You almost got caught.]

968
01:02:41,577 --> 01:02:43,392
I wasn't able to do it.

969
01:02:45,115 --> 01:02:47,100
Kwang Soo.

970
01:02:47,101 --> 01:02:49,482
I think Fabien may have
noticed something.

971
01:02:50,415 --> 01:02:52,892
[That could be very possible...]

972
01:02:54,273 --> 01:02:56,364
We'll save Fabien for later.

973
01:02:57,656 --> 01:03:00,134
I should've just ripped it off,
but I got really flustered.

974
01:03:00,135 --> 01:03:02,070
[Such a bold conversation to have
in front of their prey.]

975
01:03:02,967 --> 01:03:06,083
Okay, like the roasted dumplings
that you're all eating right now...

976
01:03:06,084 --> 01:03:10,568
We have prepared some dumplings that have
been filled with a variety of different fillings.

977
01:03:10,658 --> 01:03:15,762
Succeed the mission by trying the dumplings
and guessing the filling inside.

978
01:03:15,797 --> 01:03:17,492
[Guess the dumpling's fillings to succeed.]

979
01:03:17,493 --> 01:03:19,428
- Number four.
- Okay, four.

980
01:03:20,384 --> 01:03:23,928
[Inside dumpling number four-
Wild strawberries.]

981
01:03:25,186 --> 01:03:30,666
[The dumpling is freshly deep fried
right on the spot.]

982
01:03:31,928 --> 01:03:34,535
Okay, the dumplings are now ready.

983
01:03:34,536 --> 01:03:37,795
- Dumpling number four.
- I'll feed it to you.

984
01:03:37,796 --> 01:03:40,638
[The Client and the Troubleshooter are
just concentrating on the mission for now.]

985
01:03:40,639 --> 01:03:42,348
- You can't tell just from looking, can you?
- Ouch, that's hot.

986
01:03:42,349 --> 01:03:44,502
Okay, Kwang Soo's turn.

987
01:03:48,004 --> 01:03:50,440
- This can't be easy.
- No, it doesn't look easy.

988
01:03:52,546 --> 01:03:54,446
Is the filling still alive?

989
01:03:58,626 --> 01:04:01,364
[Has Ji Sung guessed that it's been
filled with wild strawberries?]

990
01:04:01,365 --> 01:04:02,772
Ji Sung knows.

991
01:04:02,773 --> 01:04:05,238
I think I know.
Wait, don't say anything.

992
01:04:05,645 --> 01:04:07,007
Ji Sung, are we...

993
01:04:08,697 --> 01:04:12,439
[If we guess it correctly,
then we have to leave this place.]

994
01:04:15,226 --> 01:04:17,676
[Unable to read what he's thinking.]

995
01:04:17,677 --> 01:04:20,975
I know what it is,
but are you really going to say it?

996
01:04:24,353 --> 01:04:25,941
We're going to guess this, right?

997
01:04:26,596 --> 01:04:28,912
[Suspicion creeping into his eyes.]

998
01:04:29,766 --> 01:04:32,268
- I know exactly what this is.
- Then guess what it is.

999
01:04:32,269 --> 01:04:36,753
- It's okay for me to guess it, right?
- That's the whole point of this game.

1000
01:04:37,846 --> 01:04:40,756
I don't get what you're trying to say.
Be more clear about what you're saying.

1001
01:04:40,757 --> 01:04:42,793
[They have to leave the spot if they guess it,
deterring them from their secret mission.]

1002
01:04:43,625 --> 01:04:45,817
You get to leave as soon as you
correctly guess the answer.

1003
01:04:45,818 --> 01:04:48,385
You have to leave as soon as
you correctly guess the answer.

1004
01:04:49,028 --> 01:04:51,321
[So that's what you were trying to tell me!]

1005
01:04:52,310 --> 01:04:54,244
Come on, say something!

1006
01:04:54,245 --> 01:04:56,692
[We still have to get Fabien too!]

1007
01:04:57,162 --> 01:05:01,585
- Can we stay for a bit after guessing it?
- Okay, I think I get it.

1008
01:05:02,638 --> 01:05:05,349
[What are those two doing?]

1009
01:05:05,350 --> 01:05:08,118
- Go ahead and guess.
- Strawberries!

1010
01:05:09,258 --> 01:05:12,215
- Strawberries? I don't think so.
- No, wait!

1011
01:05:12,216 --> 01:05:14,311
[Giraffe mistakenly guesses
the correct answer.]

1012
01:05:14,419 --> 01:05:15,559
- One, two, three.
- Strawberries.

1013
01:05:15,560 --> 01:05:18,863
No, no, no!
Orange!

1014
01:05:18,864 --> 01:05:21,057
No, strawberries and oranges
are way too different.

1015
01:05:21,058 --> 01:05:23,695
[Something's weird...]

1016
01:05:24,346 --> 01:05:25,637
Orange.

1017
01:05:26,782 --> 01:05:30,081
[The Client and Troubleshooter fortunately
fails just as they had planned.]

1018
01:05:30,401 --> 01:05:32,598
Why aren't they guessing the answer?

1019
01:05:34,282 --> 01:05:39,105
[If they're caught by even just one person,
then they fail their secret mission.]

1020
01:05:39,567 --> 01:05:42,220
Just let it go.

1021
01:05:46,117 --> 01:05:51,107
[Did they escape Ha Ha's suspicion?]

1022
01:05:51,913 --> 01:05:54,114
Why are you not guessing the answer?

1023
01:05:54,775 --> 01:05:58,535
[Ha Ha's suspicions are getting
stronger and stronger.]

1024
01:05:58,786 --> 01:06:03,429
Ugh, I seriously don't get Kwang Soo.
He keeps getting too distracted to get it.

1025
01:06:04,251 --> 01:06:06,747
[We're not in trouble, are we?]

1026
01:06:09,163 --> 01:06:11,403
What's going on?

1027
01:06:11,808 --> 01:06:14,461
[Imminent danger!]

1028
01:06:15,686 --> 01:06:17,701
It's all over.

1029
01:06:17,702 --> 01:06:19,983
This is too hard. Let's just
get this done and get out of here.

1030
01:06:24,910 --> 01:06:28,384
[The biggest danger this team
has had to face!]

1031
01:06:30,545 --> 01:06:33,529
Wow, Na Eun looks so pretty
with her bangs hanging down like that.

1032
01:06:33,530 --> 01:06:36,253
You look really pretty sitting up there.

1033
01:06:39,547 --> 01:06:41,570
[A fairy's scream.]

1034
01:06:43,879 --> 01:06:45,436
This is so fun!

1035
01:06:47,944 --> 01:06:50,678
[And fall off in just as fun of a fashion.]

1036
01:06:53,855 --> 01:06:56,480
- Seven seconds?
- You did great!

1037
01:06:56,614 --> 01:06:58,714
Jong Kook,
you just need to get a minute.

1038
01:06:58,715 --> 01:07:00,209
What did you say?

1039
01:07:01,199 --> 01:07:05,158
- You should use a real bull for him.
- He should go to Texas and try it for real.

1040
01:07:06,022 --> 01:07:08,872
He should go and try it out for real.

1041
01:07:08,873 --> 01:07:12,134
[The Tiger gets on the mechanical bull
instead of the real thing in Texas.]

1042
01:07:12,869 --> 01:07:15,817
[Succeed the mission by
holding on for 60 seconds.]

1043
01:07:17,889 --> 01:07:19,925
[Let's do this!]

1044
01:07:24,836 --> 01:07:27,190
[Strength!]

1045
01:07:27,191 --> 01:07:29,511
[And only by strength alone!]

1046
01:07:33,297 --> 01:07:35,389
Look at his arms.

1047
01:07:39,093 --> 01:07:43,867
[The Tiger is holding on by
the sheer force of his own strength.]

1048
01:07:49,296 --> 01:07:51,649
He looked like he was going to
rip off the handlebars.

1049
01:07:51,650 --> 01:07:53,843
- That was 16 seconds.
- 16 seconds?

1050
01:07:53,844 --> 01:07:57,030
[Jong Kook has the longest time of 16 seconds,
but still fails to succeed the mission.]

1051
01:07:57,500 --> 01:07:59,563
- Good luck, Jae Suk.
- Okay.

1052
01:08:00,089 --> 01:08:02,646
[Jae Suk tries to break Jong Kook's record.]

1053
01:08:06,589 --> 01:08:09,455
[Starts off pretty well.]

1054
01:08:15,372 --> 01:08:17,363
[Second bout of agony.]

1055
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:21,934
[Stabbed twice in the 'x' region by the bull.]

1056
01:08:24,962 --> 01:08:28,229
[Inexplicable agony.]

1057
01:08:31,131 --> 01:08:33,808
[Ladies got to witness something
that they never should've seen.]

1058
01:08:34,879 --> 01:08:36,748
He got stabbed by that point.

1059
01:08:36,911 --> 01:08:40,365
[The mechanical bull puts a person out.]

1060
01:08:42,111 --> 01:08:46,719
[Painful... and embarrassing all at once.]

1061
01:08:46,720 --> 01:08:48,589
When are we ever going
to get to eat?

1062
01:08:49,583 --> 01:08:52,066
[Finish up the ride, and let's eat!]

1063
01:08:52,067 --> 01:08:55,926
[Meanwhile, at the dumpling restaurant.]

1064
01:08:55,927 --> 01:08:57,735
Isn't it good?

1065
01:08:57,736 --> 01:08:59,595
[Seems to know what the filling is.]

1066
01:09:01,065 --> 01:09:02,772
- Pupa!
- Yes, that's it.

1067
01:09:02,773 --> 01:09:04,112
Pupa?

1068
01:09:04,113 --> 01:09:05,940
Yeah, that's what I'm tasting.

1069
01:09:05,941 --> 01:09:09,774
[If they get it right... when
are we ever going to get Big-nose?]

1070
01:09:09,775 --> 01:09:12,448
One, two, three.
Pupa!

1071
01:09:12,449 --> 01:09:14,010
Pupa.

1072
01:09:15,898 --> 01:09:18,638
[The Sibling Couple clears the mission.]

1073
01:09:20,873 --> 01:09:25,084
[This is bad... this is really bad...]

1074
01:09:25,085 --> 01:09:26,489
The taste was so strong.

1075
01:09:26,490 --> 01:09:29,503
Suk Jin was going to say something else.
You know that, right?

1076
01:09:29,504 --> 01:09:32,216
He only went along with Ji Hyo when
she guessed that it was pupa.

1077
01:09:32,917 --> 01:09:35,131
[Their anxiety level is rising.]

1078
01:09:35,853 --> 01:09:38,191
[Ready to cry.]

1079
01:09:40,477 --> 01:09:45,391
[They're probably
going to leave at any minute.]

1080
01:09:58,858 --> 01:10:01,077
Your name tag is on upside down.

1081
01:10:04,036 --> 01:10:05,365
Okay.

1082
01:10:08,236 --> 01:10:11,067
[Target- Ji Suk Jin.
Succeeds the secret revenge mission.]

1083
01:10:11,068 --> 01:10:13,463
[Giraffe's bold attack.]

1084
01:10:16,245 --> 01:10:23,096
[These two are now ousted!
Goodbye!]

1085
01:10:24,540 --> 01:10:27,781
[Tourist Couple's turn
at the dumpling mission.]

1086
01:10:28,159 --> 01:10:29,742
I know this.

1087
01:10:31,067 --> 01:10:34,412
[The Reaction Duo!]

1088
01:10:34,413 --> 01:10:36,388
This is so good!

1089
01:10:37,322 --> 01:10:38,562
I know this.

1090
01:10:38,563 --> 01:10:40,781
[These two are still eyeing Fabien's back.]

1091
01:10:40,782 --> 01:10:42,712
- I know this.
- One, two, three.

1092
01:10:42,713 --> 01:10:44,192
- Chocolate.
- Chocolate.

1093
01:10:45,753 --> 01:10:47,503
- Then what else is it?
- It's very similar.

1094
01:10:50,910 --> 01:10:52,865
- Choco pie?
- No, I don't think so.

1095
01:10:53,202 --> 01:10:55,485
- One, two, three.
- Choco pie.

1096
01:10:55,486 --> 01:10:56,818
Choco pie.

1097
01:10:56,819 --> 01:10:58,752
[Can't be, could it?]

1098
01:10:59,801 --> 01:11:02,221
[Choco pie- Correct answer.]

1099
01:11:04,808 --> 01:11:07,029
- What were you thinking?
- Why did you tell them the answer?

1100
01:11:08,412 --> 01:11:10,735
Just rip this off his back right now.

1101
01:11:10,736 --> 01:11:13,607
[Huh?
He ripped off the name tag?]

1102
01:11:14,061 --> 01:11:16,087
Just rip off his name tag.

1103
01:11:16,088 --> 01:11:19,029
[Rips off his Ha Ha's name tag as if he's
reprimanding him for giving out the answer.]

1104
01:11:26,212 --> 01:11:29,227
[Cleverly succeeds
their secret mission on Ha Ha.]

1105
01:11:29,228 --> 01:11:32,634
I just gave them a little hint since they're
foreigners and unfamiliar with things.

1106
01:11:32,635 --> 01:11:35,888
[Ji Sung puts the name tag back on
nice and pretty after succeeding his mission.]

1107
01:11:36,375 --> 01:11:37,826
Thank you, Ha Ha.

1108
01:11:38,799 --> 01:11:42,043
[Time for the Tour Couple to leave
for their next mission location.]

1109
01:11:43,839 --> 01:11:47,436
[When are they going to
get their revenge on Fabien?]

1110
01:11:48,417 --> 01:11:51,128
- Wait for us, and we'll go together.
- What?

1111
01:11:51,129 --> 01:11:54,176
- Wait for us and we'll go together.
- Don't you need a ride?

1112
01:11:54,980 --> 01:12:01,960
[But Fabien unfortunately leaves
for their next location.]

1113
01:12:04,505 --> 01:12:07,266
Go wait for us in our car, Otswiri.
We'll be right there.

1114
01:12:07,864 --> 01:12:09,976
[What are we going to do?]

1115
01:12:10,434 --> 01:12:13,302
[I'm sure there will be other chances.]

1116
01:12:14,360 --> 01:12:17,951
Since you two are really struggling with this,
you're all going to do this simultaneously.

1117
01:12:17,952 --> 01:12:19,485
First team to guess gets to leave first?

1118
01:12:19,486 --> 01:12:22,725
[Huh Kyung Hwan is the only one left here
for them to get their secret revenge on.]

1119
01:12:25,546 --> 01:12:27,078
What is this?

1120
01:12:27,079 --> 01:12:29,365
[No indication of wanting to
succeed the dumpling mission.]

1121
01:12:31,787 --> 01:12:33,442
What is this taste?

1122
01:12:34,703 --> 01:12:37,450
[Could Kyung Hwan know what it is?]

1123
01:12:39,156 --> 01:12:40,632
Don't let him hear what you're saying.

1124
01:12:42,510 --> 01:12:44,823
- Correct answer.
- Answer! Sea snails!

1125
01:12:44,824 --> 01:12:47,157
- One, two, three.
- Sea snails!

1126
01:12:47,158 --> 01:12:50,199
Wow, that's right.
It is sea snails.

1127
01:12:58,559 --> 01:13:00,767
[Huh?]

1128
01:13:04,643 --> 01:13:06,965
[Focuses on Kyung Hwan's name tag.]

1129
01:13:14,848 --> 01:13:18,705
I just want to rip off your name tag.
You're ousted too.

1130
01:13:18,706 --> 01:13:22,269
[The name tag is ripped off.]

1131
01:13:22,270 --> 01:13:31,506
[But if these two suspect something,
then it's all game over.]

1132
01:13:31,507 --> 01:13:33,881
What was that for?
Why are you doing that?

1133
01:13:33,882 --> 01:13:36,209
[They're still unaware of the secret mission!]

1134
01:13:36,210 --> 01:13:38,452
Why are you guys jumping turns?
It was our turn.

1135
01:13:39,144 --> 01:13:40,959
[Giraffe still looks weary of
the other team.]

1136
01:13:42,632 --> 01:13:46,677
That should've been our turn, right?
We should've been able to go first.

1137
01:13:49,006 --> 01:13:50,476
Okay, we'll accept your win.

1138
01:13:50,477 --> 01:13:53,808

as if it's no big deal for them.]

1139
01:13:55,445 --> 01:13:57,913
[Target- Huh Kyung Hwan.
Succeeds on getting their secret revenge.]

1140
01:13:59,842 --> 01:14:02,475
[Since they may still get suspicious...]

1141
01:14:02,476 --> 01:14:05,541
[Let's change the subject back
to dumplings.]

1142
01:14:08,312 --> 01:14:11,806
[You can leave now.]

1143
01:14:34,683 --> 01:14:38,431
[One Day Tour- Third Stop.
Gwiae Traditional House.]

1144
01:14:40,143 --> 01:14:48,524
[Youngchun's premiere tourist attraction-
Traditional home full of historical artifacts.]

1145
01:14:48,525 --> 01:14:50,033
It's set up for a wedding.

1146

[A traditional wedding ceremony
has been set up on the front lawn.]

1147
01:14:54,760 --> 01:14:56,984
- What was that thing called again?
- Jokduri.

1148
01:14:56,985 --> 01:14:59,210
[And hanging in midair are Samo and Jokduri.
(Wedding head pieces for bride and groom.)]

1149
01:14:59,211 --> 01:15:02,671
This place is known as Gwiae Home,
which is well known throughout Youngchun.

1150
01:15:03,045 --> 01:15:06,093
For this mission, each of the couples must
get their wedding picture taken.

1151
01:15:06,094 --> 01:15:08,326
[Mission- Wedding photo.]

1152
01:15:08,327 --> 01:15:12,289
Do you see the Samo
and Jokduri hanging in the air?

1153
01:15:13,070 --> 01:15:14,365
You must jump in the air

1154
01:15:14,366 --> 01:15:17,719
and the bride and groom must touch their heads
on the headpieces for you to succeed.

1155
01:15:18,294 --> 01:15:22,740
Your full face must show in the picture
for the photo to be accepted.

1156
01:15:22,741 --> 01:15:25,453
Then do we get to go off to our next
location once we succeed this mission?

1157
01:15:25,454 --> 01:15:29,263
You are cleared to go off to your final
location once you succeed this mission.

1158
01:15:30,123 --> 01:15:35,065
[Giraffe successfully got his revenge on
Na Eun during their brief filming break.]

1159
01:15:37,389 --> 01:15:42,399
[Still left on their list-
Gary, Yu Ram, Bo Mi.]

1160
01:15:42,434 --> 01:15:47,360
[And... Fabien at the other location.]

1161
01:15:47,361 --> 01:15:50,252
I have a bit of bad news
to share with all of you.

1162
01:15:50,253 --> 01:15:54,081
This place is pretty far out.
So you must work hard and fast.

1163
01:15:54,082 --> 01:15:55,306
[This location is further away from the final
location than where Fabien currently is.]

1164
01:15:55,307 --> 01:15:58,408
[They must succeed this mission to get
to the final location before Fabien does.]

1165
01:15:59,511 --> 01:16:02,612
[Time for an emergency meeting.]

1166

[Troubleshooter, Ji Sung's brilliant plan
to help his Client, Giraffe get his revenge.]

1168
01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:12,224
That was good earlier.

1169
01:16:13,277 --> 01:16:15,986
[Will Giraffe be able to
pull this one off too?]

1170
01:16:18,066 --> 01:16:20,896
Ready, set...

1171
01:16:23,107 --> 01:16:26,132
[Competitive energy.]

[Kwang Soo heads over towards Yu Ram as
well as attempt to clear the photo mission.]

1174
01:16:40,618 --> 01:16:42,275
[Target locked.]

1175
01:16:43,179 --> 01:16:46,865
[His target... is Yu Ram's name tag.]

1176
01:16:48,006 --> 01:16:50,329
[There's no time to waste.]

1177
01:16:50,330 --> 01:16:52,822
[Must attack now.]

in front of his eyes!]

[Rips off her name tag while pretending
to fall down as planned.]

1181

01:17:19,096 --> 01:17:21,965
[I'm proud of you, my Giraffe.]

1183
01:17:23,523 --> 01:17:26,022
Something very unfortunate just happened.

1184
01:17:26,023 --> 01:17:27,950
Something very unfair just happened.

1185
01:17:28,745 --> 01:17:30,039
What the heck was that?

1186
01:17:32,365 --> 01:17:35,289
[Why did he rip off my name tag?]

1187
01:17:36,442 --> 01:17:40,903
[They must not get caught!]

1188
01:17:41,572 --> 01:17:43,443
What's that?

1189
01:17:44,077 --> 01:17:46,258
Why did you do that to Yu Ram?

1190
01:17:46,644 --> 01:17:49,297
[This certainly isn't easy.
We must be more careful from now on.]

1191
01:17:52,115 --> 01:17:54,134
Why did you do that to Yu Ram?

1192
01:17:54,135 --> 01:17:57,079
[Target- Cha Yu Ram.
Succeeds in getting his secret revenge.]

1193
01:17:59,929 --> 01:18:02,953
[That was good.]

1194
01:18:04,228 --> 01:18:06,034
[Time to check the photo.]

1195
01:18:07,377 --> 01:18:09,900
[All six people are pushing down
Kwang Soo's head.]

1196
01:18:09,901 --> 01:18:11,714
That's totally not fair.

1197
01:18:11,715 --> 01:18:15,454
They're all shoving my head down
towards the ground.

1198
01:18:16,340 --> 01:18:20,268
[It's okay, you still got
your revenge on Yu Ram.]

1199
01:18:20,663 --> 01:18:22,671
I'll be the groom.

1200
01:18:22,672 --> 01:18:25,947
- Stone Grandmother isn't pulling through.
- We still have faith.

1201
01:18:27,759 --> 01:18:30,454
Bo Mi, you have to pull yourself together.

1202
01:18:30,455 --> 01:18:32,478
[Gary and Bo Mi are still left on their list.]

1203
01:18:32,479 --> 01:18:34,756
Come on, let's just get this over with.

1204
01:18:34,757 --> 01:18:37,388
- We can still win this.
- Get ready!

1205
01:18:37,389 --> 01:18:39,088
Ready, set, go!

1206
01:18:39,317 --> 01:18:41,435
[Photo time- Start.]

1207
01:18:43,180 --> 01:18:46,512
[Casually goes to stand next to Bo Mi.]

1208
01:18:52,169 --> 01:18:54,894
[A head on collision.]

1209
01:18:55,913 --> 01:18:59,697
[No one pays him the least bit of attention
and are only focused on their mission.]

1210
01:19:02,325 --> 01:19:04,923
- Are you hurt? I feel so bad.
- What happened to your nose?

1211
01:19:04,924 --> 01:19:07,149
Yu Ram rammed her head into my nose.

1212
01:19:09,077 --> 01:19:10,749
There was a huge cracking sound.

1213
01:19:11,194 --> 01:19:15,350
[A clear picture of the incident.]

1214
01:19:17,147 --> 01:19:19,434
There's a very clear photo
showing exactly what happened.

1215
01:19:20,358 --> 01:19:21,999
See that?

1216
01:19:22,898 --> 01:19:26,214
- She might as well have just punched me.
- That's like a crime scene photo.

1217
01:19:26,215 --> 01:19:28,545
I'd like to file a complaint.

1218
01:19:30,614 --> 01:19:33,815
[Agrees to have only one team go at a time
to avoid any further accidents.]

1219
01:19:33,991 --> 01:19:38,347
It's our turn.
One, two, three.

1220
01:19:41,009 --> 01:19:43,260
[It's not time for us
to clear this mission yet.]

1221
01:19:45,156 --> 01:19:46,608
- You got it.
- I think we got it.

1222
01:19:47,370 --> 01:19:49,873
[Gary and Yu Ram's turn.]

1223
01:19:51,942 --> 01:19:54,332
[Let's see here...]

1224
01:19:55,951 --> 01:19:59,365
[While everyone else is looking elsewhere...]

1225
01:20:00,292 --> 01:20:03,492
[This is my chance!]

1226
01:20:07,244 --> 01:20:09,520
[But, just then!]

1227
01:20:18,155 --> 01:20:21,645
[The name tag is off.]

1228
01:20:24,300 --> 01:20:28,527
[Everyone's focus is now on Kwang Soo.]

1229
01:20:28,528 --> 01:20:30,547
[Has he been caught?]

1230
01:20:30,548 --> 01:20:33,241
[But everyone just laughs and
he fortunately escapes the danger.]

1231
01:20:33,242 --> 01:20:37,668
- You've got to stop doing that, Kwang Soo.
- Okay, I won't do it anymore.

1232
01:20:37,669 --> 01:20:39,950
- Stop getting in everyone's way!
- Okay, I won't do it anymore.

1233
01:20:40,498 --> 01:20:43,419
[Target- Gary.
Succeeds by the skin of his teeth.]

1234
01:20:44,033 --> 01:20:45,599
[Continues their attempt to
succeed the mission.]

1235
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:48,450
[There's no more time to waste.]

1236
01:20:55,934 --> 01:21:00,462
[Target- Bo Mi.]

1237
01:21:03,650 --> 01:21:06,209
- Kwang Soo's pushing me down.
- No, that's Ji Hyo.

1238
01:21:06,210 --> 01:21:10,061
[Unable to get his hand on her name tag
with all the jumping that she's doing.]

1239
01:21:23,956 --> 01:21:26,731
[Hurry, Kwang Soo.]

1240
01:21:32,156 --> 01:21:34,801
[Just rips off her name tag out in the open
out of desperation.]

1241
01:21:37,175 --> 01:21:38,844
How long are we going to do this for?

1242
01:21:38,845 --> 01:21:40,707
There's no end to this game.

1243
01:21:40,708 --> 01:21:42,719
[Ji Sung, did I rush too much?]

1244
01:21:43,213 --> 01:21:45,956
[No, it wasn't bad.]

1245
01:21:49,165 --> 01:21:53,104
This game causes more injuries than
name tag elimination ever did.

1246
01:21:54,231 --> 01:21:56,994
[Target- Bo Mi.
Successfully gets their secret revenge.]

1247
01:21:57,604 --> 01:21:59,218
I think someone succeeded.

1248
01:21:59,219 --> 01:22:00,597
[Time to check the photo.]

1249
01:22:07,094 --> 01:22:11,288
[Run, Gary, run!]

1250
01:22:18,323 --> 01:22:20,002
She's completely blocking my face.

1251
01:22:20,573 --> 01:22:24,633
[Kwang Soo's face is primarily blocked
by Bo Mi's head and hair.]

1252
01:22:24,634 --> 01:22:27,127
She's completely blocking
my face from the camera.

1253
01:22:27,128 --> 01:22:30,459
- Why are you getting in the mood?
- I wasn't getting in the mood!

1254
01:22:30,986 --> 01:22:32,610
No, I wasn't getting in the mood!

1255
01:22:33,400 --> 01:22:35,333
How is that getting in the mood?

1256
01:22:35,334 --> 01:22:39,816
- No, that's just a huge misunderstanding.
- But you look really weird in that picture.

1257
01:22:40,658 --> 01:22:44,983
[Please don't misunderstand.]

1258
01:22:44,984 --> 01:22:49,383
[I'm just trying to clear my mission.]

1259
01:22:49,384 --> 01:22:52,199
[I'm telling the truth...]

1260
01:22:55,629 --> 01:22:57,284
I know we can do this.

1261
01:22:59,565 --> 01:23:04,128
[Only thing left to do now is to clear
the photo mission as quickly as possible.]

1262
01:23:08,354 --> 01:23:11,332
[Meanwhile, at a different location.]

1263
01:23:12,040 --> 01:23:13,647
Let's do this!

1264
01:23:13,648 --> 01:23:16,187
[These couples are doing
a paint long jump mission.]

1265
01:23:26,002 --> 01:23:29,740
[Unbelievable jumping skills.]

1266
01:23:31,107 --> 01:23:34,957
[Amazing athletic abilities making
other people's jaws drop in awe.]

1267
01:23:38,769 --> 01:23:41,242
His record is 6m.

1268
01:23:43,286 --> 01:23:45,148
- Okay, time to take the picture.
- Okay.

1269
01:23:49,590 --> 01:23:53,645
[The Client and the Troubleshooter are now
doing whatever they can to clear the mission.]

1270
01:23:54,569 --> 01:23:56,366
You can't shield my face with your hands!

1271
01:23:56,367 --> 01:23:58,619
You can't shield my face with your hands!

1272
01:24:02,395 --> 01:24:03,819
Jump, Ji Hyo.

1273
01:24:14,211 --> 01:24:17,167
[Did they clear the photo mission?]

1274
01:24:18,980 --> 01:24:22,875
[A perfect success for the giant Giraffe.]

1275
01:24:22,876 --> 01:24:25,426
He's just standing there.

1276
01:24:27,454 --> 01:24:31,783
[But unfortunately fails the mission due to
the Troubleshooter's shorter stature.]

1277
01:24:37,187 --> 01:24:39,976
[A fierce physical battle.]

1278
01:24:41,868 --> 01:24:45,233
[Their heading moves are almost
World Cup worthy.]

1279
01:24:55,472 --> 01:24:57,506
Do you think that we got it?

1280
01:25:00,954 --> 01:25:02,196
We got it!

1281
01:25:02,436 --> 01:25:05,990
- Gary is off center.
- It's a perfect shot of Cha Yu Ram.

1282
01:25:06,351 --> 01:25:08,999
But Gary is slightly off center.

1283
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:11,628
But that's how I usually wear my hats.
It's the hip-hop style.

1284
01:25:11,629 --> 01:25:14,815
[Hip-hop Gary-
Even wears his Samo in the hip-hop style.]

1285
01:25:15,659 --> 01:25:18,377
Why can't I wear it my own way?

1286
01:25:20,606 --> 01:25:21,660
Set, go!

1287
01:25:24,985 --> 01:25:26,525
Hurry, Ji Sung.
Jump.

1288
01:25:28,912 --> 01:25:32,466
[Kwang Soo's perfectly in place.
It's now up to Ji Sung to jump in place.]

1289
01:25:36,403 --> 01:25:39,748
[Continues to jump
without any rest in between.]

1290
01:25:47,731 --> 01:25:49,183
I think these two might've succeeded.

1291
01:25:49,914 --> 01:25:51,412
I think we got it with the first shot.

1292
01:25:52,783 --> 01:25:54,308
Please.

1293
01:26:00,604 --> 01:26:02,521
[Kwang Soo is in perfect position.]

1294
01:26:02,522 --> 01:26:04,490
- Okay, I'm good.
- Show me.

1295
01:26:04,491 --> 01:26:06,041
[If Ji Sung succeeded too...]

1296
01:26:07,671 --> 01:26:10,898
- Yes!
- Ji Sung and Kwang Soo pass.

1297
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:15,140
[Ji Sung and Kwang Soo succeed
the photo mission in first place.]

1298
01:26:15,732 --> 01:26:18,923
[Final location- Yusungri Elementary School.]

1299
01:26:18,924 --> 01:26:21,662
Here's the address.
We're going to get going right now.

1300
01:26:21,663 --> 01:26:23,373
[Off to the final destination.]

1301
01:26:24,612 --> 01:26:27,063
[Tourist Couple succeeds their mission
almost at the same time.]

1302
01:26:27,064 --> 01:26:30,617
- We don't have a driver's license.
- Seriously? You can't drive?

1303
01:26:30,618 --> 01:26:32,879
Then you're going to have to
come with us.

1304
01:26:33,905 --> 01:26:36,242
So the first team to arrive wins the race?

1305
01:26:36,243 --> 01:26:40,905
[Speed is key to winning the race!]

1306
01:26:42,479 --> 01:26:46,358
[The winner of the race
is still undetermined.]

1307
01:26:47,723 --> 01:26:49,827
This is really tough.

1308
01:26:51,461 --> 01:26:54,876
We just need to get Fabien,
and we're done.

1309
01:26:54,877 --> 01:26:57,850
I attempted to get Fabien earlier,
and failed.

1310
01:26:57,851 --> 01:27:01,286
[Time to make another attempt at
eliminating Fabien's name tag.]

1311
01:27:01,287 --> 01:27:04,988
[Fabien is weary of anyone
getting too close to his name tag.]

1312
01:27:05,439 --> 01:27:08,440
If we're not careful about it,
then we could ruin everything.

1313
01:27:08,441 --> 01:27:11,980
[Too rash with their move,
then they could lose their chance to win.]

1314
01:27:12,625 --> 01:27:15,434
We need to just rip it off in one shot
rather than taking our time with it.

1315
01:27:18,212 --> 01:27:20,778
[Arrives at the final location.]

1316
01:27:20,779 --> 01:27:24,301
The order of arrival is crucial,
so run over to the mark immediately.

1317
01:27:24,674 --> 01:27:27,810
[Blind Date Couple and the Tourist Couple
beats them to the final location.]

1318
01:27:29,508 --> 01:27:31,274
- Okay, here's your final mission.
- Okay.

1319
01:27:31,275 --> 01:27:33,611
This is the final location,
and this is your final mission.

1320
01:27:33,612 --> 01:27:36,152
Do you see the cars parked over
to the side?

1321
01:27:36,153 --> 01:27:39,810
Four of those cars contain
a winning prize on the inside.

1322
01:27:40,475 --> 01:27:43,974
There are four car keys hidden
throughout this area.

1323
01:27:43,975 --> 01:27:48,931
Find the car keys to unlock one
of the car doors and claim your prize.

1324
01:27:50,195 --> 01:27:53,744
[Time to find the car keys!]

1325
01:28:00,537 --> 01:28:03,764
[Just then, the Client and the Troubleshooter
also arrives on scene.]

1326
01:28:04,996 --> 01:28:08,266
[Before anyone else succeeds
at completing the final mission...]

1327
01:28:08,267 --> 01:28:11,299
[We must eliminate Fabien's name tag!]

1328
01:28:17,660 --> 01:28:20,147
[Kkuk discovers a car key.]

1329
01:28:20,148 --> 01:28:21,594
Yes?

1330
01:28:30,719 --> 01:28:33,671
[Otswiri also discovers a car key.]

1331
01:28:34,396 --> 01:28:36,533
- I found it!
- You got it?

1332
01:28:37,653 --> 01:28:40,664
[These two are feeling the pressure!]

1333
01:28:42,313 --> 01:28:43,776
I found it!

1334
01:28:44,536 --> 01:28:49,573
[Their target... is Fabien!]

1335
01:28:50,475 --> 01:28:53,018
[As soon as the Tourist Couple unlocks and
gets in the car, then the race is all over!]

1336
01:28:53,916 --> 01:28:57,538
[Before these two
gets in one of these cars...]

1337
01:28:57,573 --> 01:29:02,326
[We must stop them in their path!]

1338
01:29:03,453 --> 01:29:06,564
[Troubleshooter, Ji Sung, awaits
their arrival in front of the cars.]

1339
01:29:07,778 --> 01:29:13,262
[There's only... one chance.]

1340
01:29:14,347 --> 01:29:15,813
Which one is it?

1341
01:29:21,906 --> 01:29:25,643
[Tourist Couple passes the key back and forth
thinking that's what these two are after.]

1342
01:29:30,900 --> 01:29:36,273
[At last... their final name tag.]

1343
01:29:36,820 --> 01:29:39,983
[They have managed to succeed in
eliminating 13 other name tags so far.]

1344
01:29:39,984 --> 01:29:44,010
[All the anxiety and hard work...]

1345
01:29:50,100 --> 01:29:52,912
[It's off!]

1346
01:29:54,017 --> 01:29:57,013
[Troubleshooter, Ji Sung,
rips off Fabien's name tag.]

1347
01:29:58,060 --> 01:30:01,656
[Ji Sung succeeds in eliminating
the final name tag.]

1348
01:30:01,884 --> 01:30:03,656
- What was that?
- Nothing to worry about.

1349
01:30:04,663 --> 01:30:06,548
- What was that?
- No, sorry.

1350
01:30:08,320 --> 01:30:10,019
- What are you doing?
- Sorry.

1351
01:30:10,842 --> 01:30:14,585
[Even reattaches it onto Fabien's back.
A perfect success to their secret mission!]

1352
01:30:16,726 --> 01:30:20,646
[Troubleshooter, Ji Sung.]

1353
01:30:20,647 --> 01:30:23,605
[Client, Kwang Soo.]

1354
01:30:23,606 --> 01:30:27,169
[Completes getting their revenge
on all 14 members.]

1355
01:30:28,465 --> 01:30:31,211
I think he did that on purpose
to throw him off.

1356
01:30:31,212 --> 01:30:32,661
Run!

1357
01:30:33,586 --> 01:30:36,886
[Rest of the couples start to
run in one by one.]

1358
01:30:36,887 --> 01:30:40,002
- I think they found something.
- Give me the strength I need!

1359
01:30:40,003 --> 01:30:41,655
[They don't even realize that they can't
even take home any of the prizes anymore...]

1360
01:30:41,656 --> 01:30:44,857
[Ha Ha discovers the third key.]

1361
01:30:50,826 --> 01:30:53,281
[Doesn't he look happy?]

1362
01:30:55,289 --> 01:30:57,591
I got it!

1363
01:31:02,680 --> 01:31:04,714
[Big-nose Brother finds a key of his own.]

1364
01:31:04,715 --> 01:31:07,024
Ji Hyo!

1365
01:31:07,393 --> 01:31:09,580
Ji Hyo!

1366
01:31:18,700 --> 01:31:23,013
- Why would you announce it to everyone?
- I shouldn't have screamed?

1367
01:31:23,014 --> 01:31:25,446
I still don't get it after four years
of doing this show.

1368
01:31:25,447 --> 01:31:27,609
It still feels so new to me.

1369
01:31:27,610 --> 01:31:30,515
Otswiri said he needed to make rent money,
so I guess he succeeded.

1370
01:31:30,516 --> 01:31:32,297
[A suspicious looking smile on their faces.]

1371
01:31:32,298 --> 01:31:38,744
So the winning prize goes to the four teams
who got the prize, right?

1372
01:31:39,055 --> 01:31:41,987
First place winner?
Come and get your prize.

1373
01:31:41,988 --> 01:31:44,519
[Blind Date Team- First place winner.]

1374
01:31:44,520 --> 01:31:46,626
- Are the amounts different?
- Wow, look at how thick it is.

1375
01:31:46,627 --> 01:31:49,074
- Who came in at second place?
- Otswiri?

1376
01:31:49,075 --> 01:31:55,063
[Second place prize goes to
Ji Sung and Kwang Soo.]

1377
01:31:55,895 --> 01:31:57,996
- Okay, second place winner.
- Wait, that's ours.

1378
01:31:58,862 --> 01:32:01,188
- No, you just stay quiet!
- But we came in at second place.

1379
01:32:01,912 --> 01:32:06,020
[Third place prize also goes to
Ji Sung and Kwang Soo.]

1380
01:32:06,657 --> 01:32:08,558
Come and get your fourth place prize.

1381
01:32:08,559 --> 01:32:10,487
[Fourth place prize also goes to
Ji Sung and Kwang Soo.]

1382
01:32:15,992 --> 01:32:19,882
- What's going on here?
- You all participated in today's race.

1383
01:32:19,883 --> 01:32:22,252
But remember how you've been told
that you lost your memories?

1384
01:32:22,253 --> 01:32:27,955
Before Kwang Soo lost his memories,
he had a grudge against all of you.

1385
01:32:27,956 --> 01:32:30,255
So in order to seek his revenge

1386
01:32:30,256 --> 01:32:32,720
he sought out Ji Sung's help
as his Troubleshooter

1387
01:32:32,721 --> 01:32:35,019
and played the roles of the Client
and the Troubleshooter today.

1388
01:32:35,020 --> 01:32:37,366
How could we have known that earlier
before you told us all this?

1389
01:32:37,367 --> 01:32:39,791
We only know now because you just told us.

1390
01:32:39,792 --> 01:32:43,146
[All the other couples are upset
at having been told what's going on.]

1391
01:32:43,974 --> 01:32:47,843
They received a secret mission an hour before
the rest of you woke up this morning.

1392
01:32:47,844 --> 01:32:52,429
Their mission was to rip off and reattach
everyone's name tag without being suspected.

1393
01:32:52,430 --> 01:32:54,343
- Do you all remember that happening?
- that's crazy!

1394
01:32:54,344 --> 01:32:57,769
- They got every one of you.
- Sorry.

1395
01:32:59,111 --> 01:33:00,959
- Ji Sung!
- I'm sorry.

1396
01:33:00,960 --> 01:33:03,715
That's right, he ripped it off
saying that it was on crooked.

1397
01:33:03,716 --> 01:33:06,452
[Everyone's starting to remember.]

1398
01:33:06,453 --> 01:33:08,874
Not just a few,
but they got every single one of you.

1399
01:33:09,501 --> 01:33:12,216
[Throughout the whole race...]

1400
01:33:13,160 --> 01:33:16,871
[They succeeded in getting
their revenge on all 14 members.]

1401
01:33:16,872 --> 01:33:20,229
- They made complete fools out of us.
- Ji Sung, can you treat us all out to dinner?

1402
01:33:20,230 --> 01:33:22,266
[With the exception of the Blind Date Couple,
who got in the car before they got to Fabien

1403
01:33:22,267 --> 01:33:24,117
[the rest of the prize cash goes to
Ji Sung and Kwang Soo.]

1404
01:33:24,118 --> 01:33:26,933
- Don't you think that was crossing the line?
- Can we show them how annoyed we are?

1405
01:33:26,934 --> 01:33:29,591
Yu Ram says she wants to show them
her three cushion shot.

1406
01:33:31,288 --> 01:33:35,525
Congratulations to Ji Sung and Kwang Soo
for winning today's race!
