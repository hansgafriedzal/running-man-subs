odd mirrors...]

[To the castle of a witch!]

00:01:01,113 --> 00:01:07,971
<i>Mirror, mirror on the wall...
Who's the fairest of them all?</i>

00:01:31,303 --> 00:01:34,191

[Big-nosed Dwarf, Muscle Dwarf,
Romantic Dwarf]

13
00:01:41,903 --> 00:01:43,944
Is it okay for you
to bring me in so often?

14
00:01:43,944 --> 00:01:45,544
I missed you guys!

15
00:01:45,544 --> 00:01:47,431
[Bluffing Dwarf]
[Ryu Seung Soo]

16
00:01:47,431 --> 00:01:50,586
Now we know our guest!
We know!

17
00:01:52,003 --> 00:01:55,687
[Snow White is more interested in
the apple that the Bluff Dwarf brought!]

18
00:01:55,687 --> 00:01:57,852
I've made a big mistake!

19
00:01:57,852 --> 00:01:59,715
She's more interested in the apple!

20
00:01:59,715 --> 00:02:01,468
He's my teacher!
[Seung Soo taught acting to Blank Ji in the past!]

21
00:02:01,468 --> 00:02:04,394
You feel uneasy in front of him, right?
[Seung Soo taught acting to Blank Ji in the past!]

22
00:02:04,394 --> 00:02:06,392
You can just treat me normally, Ji Hyo.

23
00:02:06,392 --> 00:02:09,911
- I don't think that's helping.
- No, it's making me even more uneasy!

24
00:02:12,105 --> 00:02:16,131
- What's the concept of today, by the way?
- Can't you tell?

25
00:02:16,132 --> 00:02:18,193
[There's a Snow White
eating an apple next to you...]

26
00:02:18,193 --> 00:02:19,382
Obviously it's Snow White!

27
00:02:19,382 --> 00:02:21,484
But Snow White looks so tired!

28
00:02:21,484 --> 00:02:22,883
It's time for her to sleep!

29
00:02:22,883 --> 00:02:25,626
Then perhaps...
Is Seung Soo the prince?

30
00:02:25,626 --> 00:02:26,700
<i>No way!</i>

31
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:29,657
So, are you saying that
I'm going to kiss my teacher today?

32
00:02:30,764 --> 00:02:31,838
[Fire burning]

33
00:02:31,838 --> 00:02:33,359
<i>Do you have to kiss today?</i>

34
00:02:33,359 --> 00:02:35,527
I think today will be very fun.

35
00:02:36,957 --> 00:02:38,444
[Pardon?]

36
00:02:38,444 --> 00:02:41,218
Your bluff is always the problem!
[The superstar of bluffing!]

37
00:02:41,218 --> 00:02:42,505
I'm dying now.

38
00:02:42,505 --> 00:02:44,552
[Snow White is supposed to faint...]

39
00:02:44,552 --> 00:02:45,952
I'm fainting now.

40
00:02:45,952 --> 00:02:47,666
Is that how it's supposed to be?

41
00:02:47,666 --> 00:02:50,613
That's what the cartoon says!
Once she bites...

42
00:02:50,613 --> 00:02:52,595
The cartoon?

43
00:02:53,096 --> 00:02:56,066
- I meant the fairytale...
- You enjoy cartoons too much!

44
00:02:56,066 --> 00:02:57,196
Fairytale!

45
00:02:57,196 --> 00:02:59,361
Fine, die already to
match the fairytale!

46
00:02:59,361 --> 00:03:01,162
I'm fainting now, okay?

47
00:03:01,162 --> 00:03:03,529
Why do you need to eat
so much apple to die?

48
00:03:03,529 --> 00:03:05,757
<i>You're supposed to die
after one bite!</i>

49
00:03:05,757 --> 00:03:08,429
<i>Are you trying to
get a meal out of it?</i>

50
00:03:08,429 --> 00:03:10,570
How can you eat so much?

51
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:12,201
I'm just going to take a bite!

52
00:03:12,201 --> 00:03:13,552
Fine, take a bite!

53
00:03:13,552 --> 00:03:16,853
Hey, princess! I think
the poisoned apple is the other one.

54
00:03:16,853 --> 00:03:19,936
Yours is a normal apple!
That's the poisoned one!

55
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:21,989
Why are you cleaning off
the poison?

56
00:03:21,989 --> 00:03:24,050
I'm eating it.

57
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:25,295
<i>Bye!</i>

58
00:03:25,295 --> 00:03:27,245
<i>Eat more, more, more!</i>

59
00:03:27,245 --> 00:03:30,423
<i>- I think that's enough!
- Yes, that should do the trick!</i>

60
00:03:30,423 --> 00:03:32,016
That's right!

61
00:03:32,016 --> 00:03:37,594
[Snow White fainted after
eating a poisoned apple.]

62
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:42,295
Princess!

63
00:03:42,295 --> 00:03:45,750
Yes, an apple for me!

64
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,623
Eat up!

65
00:03:48,496 --> 00:03:50,719
[A bite for Haroro Dwarf]

66
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:53,371
[A bite for Giraffe Dwarf]

67
00:03:54,665 --> 00:03:57,075
Princess!
[Fainting again after laughing]

68
00:03:57,075 --> 00:04:03,405
<i>Only a prince can save
Snow White from her curse.</i>

69
00:04:03,773 --> 00:04:05,457
There's a prince among us.

70
00:04:05,457 --> 00:04:10,153
The hints to solve the witch's curse
and find the prince aren't here.

71
00:04:10,153 --> 00:04:14,849
But the hints might be in the future,
where civilization is highly developed.

72
00:04:14,849 --> 00:04:18,408
So, if we don't want to save her,
we can just close here right now?

73
00:04:18,408 --> 00:04:20,602
[Angry]

74
00:04:20,602 --> 00:04:21,973
<i>She's up!</i>

75
00:04:22,442 --> 00:04:24,899
She's up!
Eat more!

76
00:04:25,909 --> 00:04:29,205
[Forced to faint again!]

77
00:04:29,205 --> 00:04:32,042
We may be in a play right now,
but a princess is down.

78
00:04:32,042 --> 00:04:34,347
Yet you look so relaxed
as you eat cookies!

79
00:04:34,347 --> 00:04:35,935
[Embarrassed]

80
00:04:35,935 --> 00:04:39,404
All of you will pass through
the mirror to the future...

81
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:44,389
Go to the future and find hints about
the curse and the prince's whereabouts.

82
00:04:44,389 --> 00:04:48,852
Snow White will disappear forever
if she doesn't wake up.

83
00:04:53,292 --> 00:04:57,492
- We're ready to accept the new princess!
- It's a pipe dream! Just let her go!

84
00:04:57,492 --> 00:05:01,971
[Resurrected!]
[I can't let that happen!]

85
00:05:01,971 --> 00:05:04,232
The next princess should be
in her 20s!

86
00:05:04,232 --> 00:05:06,436
Shouldn't I be crying right now?
Oh, no!

87
00:05:06,436 --> 00:05:07,793
[Only the Monday Couple Dwarf
cares about the princess.]

88
00:05:07,793 --> 00:05:10,477
So if you want to save the princess

89
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:14,130
you can travel to the future
through that mirror.

90
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:16,089
Kwang Soo, you can go first.

91
00:05:20,793 --> 00:05:24,459
How can he get into his character
so quickly?

92
00:05:25,747 --> 00:05:28,275
That's enough!
[Pretending to be sucked into the mirror?]

93
00:05:28,275 --> 00:05:30,110
I can't!

94
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:33,340
It's not a kidnapping.
You're going in there voluntarily.

95
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:37,968
You're supposed to go in there voluntarily!
[Is that so?]

96
00:05:37,968 --> 00:05:42,065
Just hang in there, princess!
I'll save you!

97
00:05:44,422 --> 00:05:48,076
I'll save you, princess!
I'm your prince!

98
00:05:49,831 --> 00:05:52,881
Is that truly necessary?
Can't we just go in normally?

99
00:05:52,881 --> 00:05:55,212
You must stay unconscious, Princess!

100
00:05:55,212 --> 00:05:57,618
Don't keep getting up
to peak at us, Princess!

101
00:05:57,618 --> 00:05:59,351
But it's so fun right now!

102
00:05:59,351 --> 00:06:02,531
Princess!
I'm your prince!

103
00:06:03,046 --> 00:06:04,919
[Falling]

104
00:06:05,606 --> 00:06:07,070
[Ha Ha put his foot out]

105
00:06:07,388 --> 00:06:10,229
This is great fun!

106
00:06:10,229 --> 00:06:14,111
[Did the Kid Dwarf come back from the
future to add more fun?]

107
00:06:15,528 --> 00:06:18,685
Princess!
I'll take care of you!

108
00:06:25,911 --> 00:06:28,209
Ji Hyo!
I'm coming for you!

109
00:06:28,209 --> 00:06:30,751
Just hang in there!

110
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:38,933
Ji Hyo! I'm coming for you!
Just hang in there!

111
00:06:41,396 --> 00:06:43,275
Is he going to jump
with Blank Ji?

112
00:06:43,275 --> 00:06:46,577
I just heard your bones cracking, Seung Soo!

113
00:06:46,577 --> 00:06:50,122
His knee definitely made
some cracking sound.

114
00:06:50,122 --> 00:06:53,197
[Take care of your joints first
in the future!]

115
00:06:53,197 --> 00:06:55,940
It sounded like you pulled
some muscles, Seung Soo!

116
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:58,903
I'll save you, Princess!

117
00:07:01,693 --> 00:07:07,128
[And the Seven dwarves started their journey
through time to save Snow White!]

118
00:07:13,451 --> 00:07:15,716
[Seoul, South Korea]
[2014]

119
00:07:23,523 --> 00:07:26,062
<i>Welcome to the future, everyone.</i>

120
00:07:26,062 --> 00:07:30,596
<i>You've traveled through time
to come to a city of the future.</i>

121
00:07:30,596 --> 00:07:33,467
<i>Everything you see around you right now
must be very new.</i>

122
00:07:33,467 --> 00:07:34,597
<i>Yes!</i>

123
00:07:36,111 --> 00:07:39,867
<i>The Princess has woken up
while traveling through time!</i>

124
00:07:39,867 --> 00:07:45,258
Because you put so much poison in the apple,
she's having a hard time!

125
00:07:45,258 --> 00:07:49,268
- Bring her something!
- Someone straighten up her hair!

126
00:07:50,691 --> 00:07:56,462
This mission will be a first-come-first-serve,
individual round.

127
00:07:56,462 --> 00:08:00,788
<i>We'll give the hints about the prince
on first-come-first-serve basis...</i>

128
00:08:00,788 --> 00:08:03,228
So there's really a prince among us?

129
00:08:05,286 --> 00:08:09,319
So there's a prince among us!

130
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:11,630
It can't be you.

131
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:14,666
- Who could it be?
- It might be me!

132
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:17,029
The first-come-first-serve round...

133
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:21,974
<i>You must find Kwang Soo Dwarf who's
hiding somewhere in this concrete forest.</i>

134
00:08:21,974 --> 00:08:28,042
<i>Kwang Soo Dwarf is hiding somewhere
inside of this building.</i>

135
00:08:36,269 --> 00:08:39,314
[Kwang Soo Dwarf warped into
the wrong place.]

136
00:08:39,314 --> 00:08:42,829
[Who am I?]
[Where am I?]

137
00:08:43,332 --> 00:08:48,471
Please don't tell anyone about this.

138
00:08:48,471 --> 00:08:51,624
Only staff members can be here.

139
00:08:51,624 --> 00:08:55,970
<i>You must find Kwang Soo Dwarf as soon as
possible then give him a piggy-back ride...</i>

140
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:57,454
A piggy-back ride?

141
00:08:57,454 --> 00:09:00,724
<i>To bring him back here to win.</i>

142
00:09:00,724 --> 00:09:02,909
How can Ji Hyo give him
a piggy-back ride?

143
00:09:02,909 --> 00:09:06,083
She can grab his hair
and drag him here.

144
00:09:06,083 --> 00:09:10,117
<i>Ready, set, go!</i>

145
00:09:10,117 --> 00:09:12,314
We must find him quickly.

146
00:09:12,314 --> 00:09:16,359
I didn't notice when it was only us,
but this costume is a bit embarrassing!

147
00:09:16,359 --> 00:09:17,819
I know.

148
00:09:19,045 --> 00:09:21,088
Hello.

149
00:09:21,088 --> 00:09:24,247
My costume is ridiculous, isn't it?

150
00:09:24,247 --> 00:09:25,788
<i>It's fine.</i>

151
00:09:25,788 --> 00:09:28,861
I'm sorry.
But don't laugh.

152
00:09:28,861 --> 00:09:32,083
My shoulders are already reaching
the ground.

153
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:34,737
[He's trying to hold his laugh,
but to no avail.]

154
00:09:34,737 --> 00:09:39,661
I'm wearing a costume for
your viewing pleasure on this hot day.

155
00:09:42,018 --> 00:09:44,213
[Embarrassed]

156
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:47,233
<i>Where could he be?</i>

157
00:09:47,233 --> 00:09:51,145
So I must think as if I'm Kwang Soo.

158
00:09:51,145 --> 00:09:53,027
I don't think you'll find him that way.

159
00:09:53,027 --> 00:09:53,993
I guess not.

160
00:09:53,993 --> 00:09:57,935
He's probably somewhere ridiculous.
That's my hint for you.

161
00:09:57,935 --> 00:10:01,654
What?
That's useless!

162
00:10:01,654 --> 00:10:05,823
Such bluffing won't help you!
What hint?

163
00:10:06,277 --> 00:10:10,053
Where are you, Kwang Soo?
He's tall...

164
00:10:10,053 --> 00:10:11,767
Somewhere near a mirror?

165
00:10:11,767 --> 00:10:16,560
Lee Kwang Soo...
[Searching every corner of the building]

166
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:21,218
Kwang Soo...
He might be here.

167
00:10:21,218 --> 00:10:29,525
[Where are you, Kwang Soo Dwarf?]

168
00:10:30,862 --> 00:10:33,465
[I'm right here]

169
00:10:33,465 --> 00:10:38,668
I thought I might stand out,
but I'm blending in quite well.

170
00:10:39,465 --> 00:10:43,538
[Is he saying they're similar to him?]

171
00:10:43,538 --> 00:10:48,057
No, that's not what I mean!
[People of the future are getting angry.]

172
00:10:49,552 --> 00:10:54,297
[Kwang Soo Dwarf has failed to build rapport
with his people of the future!]

173
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,534
No one has moved in here yet...

174
00:10:58,534 --> 00:11:00,658
How's it going?

175
00:11:01,999 --> 00:11:04,983
[Yoo Hyuk Dwarf sprints all of a sudden!]

176
00:11:04,983 --> 00:11:07,716
[Seung Soo Dwarf follows him!]

177
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:09,867
I got him!

178
00:11:09,867 --> 00:11:13,018
Hey, Kwang Soo!

179
00:11:13,478 --> 00:11:15,764
[Yoo Hyuk baits Seung Soo!]

180
00:11:15,764 --> 00:11:19,206
Kwang Soo!
Don't run away!

181
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:22,106
He's quite good at hiding.
I think...

182
00:11:22,106 --> 00:11:25,760
Look there!
Someone is running!

183
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,518
Who's running up there?

184
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:32,801
- Is that Jae Suk?
- Yes, it's him.

185
00:11:32,801 --> 00:11:35,072
What are they doing?

186
00:11:35,857 --> 00:11:38,493
If we go this way right now,
we can catch him!

187
00:11:39,231 --> 00:11:41,982
Hurry up!
Song Ji Hyo is coming!

188
00:11:41,982 --> 00:11:44,714
[Jae Suk is trying hard
to make his baiting realistic!]

189
00:11:45,441 --> 00:11:46,733
What is it?

190
00:11:49,021 --> 00:11:50,317
What is it?

191
00:11:50,317 --> 00:11:52,318
I baited him.

192
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:54,296
It was for Seung Soo?

193
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:56,148
[Many got tricked by Jae Suk!]

194
00:11:56,148 --> 00:11:58,327
Take care, see you later!

195
00:12:02,509 --> 00:12:06,850
Sorry to bother you while working, but
can I have a piece of your dried sweet potato?

196
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:09,000
- My mom made it from scratch.
- Is that so?

197
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,246
[Shameless Kwang Soo Dwarf
raids the food of the future!]

198
00:12:20,262 --> 00:12:22,337
[Delicious!]

199
00:12:23,663 --> 00:12:26,526
[Being generous with
someone else's sweet potato!]

200
00:12:26,804 --> 00:12:28,204
This is very good.

201
00:12:30,107 --> 00:12:32,573
[Big-nosed Brother appears!]

202
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:40,896
[Disguised Kwang Soo Dwarf
is right behind this door!]

203
00:12:44,966 --> 00:12:48,003
[He misses him!]

204
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:53,280
[Big-nosed Brother misses him
right in front of his eyes!]

205
00:12:56,428 --> 00:12:59,869
It's so delicious.

206
00:12:59,869 --> 00:13:03,345
[Did someone stop by?]

207
00:13:04,413 --> 00:13:07,714
He's doing a better job at hiding
than I expected!

208
00:13:07,714 --> 00:13:10,117
I remember hiding in this room.

209
00:13:21,227 --> 00:13:24,269
Did Haroro see him?

210
00:13:24,269 --> 00:13:29,168
He's here...

211
00:13:31,594 --> 00:13:38,416
Some weird woman is keeping her head down.
Take a look at the other end.

212
00:13:38,416 --> 00:13:42,577
She's putting her head down way too low.

213
00:13:42,577 --> 00:13:45,841
People around her are not
interacting with her...

214
00:13:46,724 --> 00:13:48,836
Excuse me, but
have you seen Lee Kwang Soo?

215
00:13:48,836 --> 00:13:50,695
- We haven't.
- Is that so?

216
00:13:50,695 --> 00:13:52,739
Okay.

217
00:13:52,739 --> 00:13:55,241
- You really haven't?
- No, we haven't.

218
00:13:55,241 --> 00:13:57,499
[Nervous]

219
00:13:57,499 --> 00:13:58,723
Here...

220
00:13:58,723 --> 00:14:00,513
You can't come in here.

221
00:14:00,513 --> 00:14:03,948
I see.
But that...

222
00:14:03,948 --> 00:14:06,336
Is something wrong with her?

223
00:14:06,336 --> 00:14:08,358
- She's very shy.
- Is that so?

224
00:14:08,358 --> 00:14:09,984
Is she one of the writers?

225
00:14:09,984 --> 00:14:13,826
But she...
Isn't she...

226
00:14:13,826 --> 00:14:15,332
[Yoo Hyuk Dwarf is approaching]

227
00:14:15,332 --> 00:14:17,857
I'm very sorry, but...

228
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:22,063
- You can't come in here.
- I'm very sorry...

229
00:14:22,617 --> 00:14:25,608
How rude of you to
disturb their meeting.

230
00:14:25,608 --> 00:14:29,440
[Cutting Yoo Hyuk out]

231
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:32,825
Has he left?

232
00:14:32,825 --> 00:14:34,800
I'm very sorry.
This will be quick.

233
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,109
Get out if you're sorry!

234
00:14:36,109 --> 00:14:39,698
- You should leave first!
- Get out of there!

235
00:14:39,698 --> 00:14:43,203
[First order of business is
blocking Jae Suk.]

236
00:14:43,768 --> 00:14:45,975
[What is it?]

237
00:14:52,302 --> 00:14:57,784
Kwang Soo!
It's so obvious that it's you!

238
00:15:08,204 --> 00:15:12,594
It's so obvious that it's you!

239
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,548
How did you know?

240
00:15:15,548 --> 00:15:19,935
Only idiots couldn't tell
that it's you!

241
00:15:19,935 --> 00:15:23,692
If we win together, we can
win prizes together too!

242
00:15:23,692 --> 00:15:24,961
Let's make this easy!

243
00:15:24,961 --> 00:15:26,976
You know that I'm not
on anyone's side, right?

244
00:15:26,976 --> 00:15:29,711
I know! But are you
going to go to Jae Suk again?

245
00:15:29,711 --> 00:15:32,339
Or side with Jong Kook?

246
00:15:32,339 --> 00:15:34,843
I guess you have a point.

247
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:38,257
- Where should I go?
- Let's get out of here first.

248
00:15:38,257 --> 00:15:42,023
Let's go, Kwang Soo!
We must leave now!

249
00:15:42,023 --> 00:15:45,022
I'm not going to go with you
if you coerce me like that!

250
00:15:45,022 --> 00:15:46,797
I'm sorry.
Please come with me.

251
00:15:46,797 --> 00:15:52,510
- I'll come with you...
- Quickly, before someone else sees you!

252
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:54,481
We must run to that emergency exit!

253
00:15:54,481 --> 00:15:58,057
- Thank you.
- Thanks! Quickly, Kwang Soo!

254
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:03,515
Where's the emergency exit here?
Get down!

255
00:16:03,515 --> 00:16:07,687
Kwang Soo!
Quickly, come this way.

256
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:11,978
Kwang Soo cannot be using his legs
to move around.

257
00:16:11,978 --> 00:16:14,125
He always must be on someone's back.

258
00:16:14,125 --> 00:16:15,949
On my back!

259
00:16:16,656 --> 00:16:20,852
Quickly, to the first floor!

260
00:16:21,722 --> 00:16:24,912
If we continue like this, we'll win!
We will be victorious!

261
00:16:24,912 --> 00:16:28,857
I want to win too, Kwang Soo!
And that's going to be today!

262
00:16:29,642 --> 00:16:33,749
Let's get off first.
Where should we go?

263
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,548
Where are we going?

264
00:16:35,548 --> 00:16:37,970
We're on our way to victory!

265
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:42,663
We're almost there.
Almost there!

266
00:16:46,254 --> 00:16:49,313
[Yoo Hyuk and Seung Soo dwarves appear!]

267
00:16:49,313 --> 00:16:51,028
I'm sorry.

268
00:16:51,028 --> 00:16:54,098
Didn't expect to see you here!

269
00:16:54,098 --> 00:16:56,690
Wait, are you going to do this by force?

270
00:16:57,023 --> 00:16:59,925
You can take him up to there.

271
00:16:59,925 --> 00:17:01,485
That's total nonsense.

272
00:17:01,485 --> 00:17:03,451
Just take him up to there.
Otherwise, Jong Kook will...

273
00:17:03,451 --> 00:17:05,383
Oh no, he's here!

274
00:17:05,383 --> 00:17:09,130
[Kook and Gary dwarves join!]

275
00:17:15,066 --> 00:17:17,362
You're the one who found him...

276
00:17:17,362 --> 00:17:19,268
And what will I get from finding him?

277
00:17:19,268 --> 00:17:21,416
Your job was just carrying
him up to here.

278
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:23,812
There was no point in finding him!

279
00:17:23,812 --> 00:17:26,015
[One must arrive at this table
with Kwang Soo to win!]

280
00:17:27,541 --> 00:17:30,222
[Seung Soo Dwarf tries to carry him.]

281
00:17:30,222 --> 00:17:33,444
[Seung Soo Dwarf fails to carry him.]

282
00:17:34,196 --> 00:17:36,819
Why are you doing this to me?

283
00:17:37,707 --> 00:17:40,153
- I'll give you a piggyback ride!
- Let's form a line!

284
00:17:40,153 --> 00:17:42,272
Snow White joins!

285
00:17:42,272 --> 00:17:44,204
Now she's here!
Damn!

286
00:17:44,204 --> 00:17:46,981
I realized no one was inside!
[This way, Kwang Soo!]

287
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:51,736
Jump! Jump!

288
00:17:51,736 --> 00:17:54,508
I said jump, you idiot!

289
00:17:56,038 --> 00:17:58,748
[Huge chaos]

290
00:17:58,748 --> 00:18:00,929
Why can't you even run?

291
00:18:00,929 --> 00:18:03,329
[Putting it all on poor Kwang Soo.]

292
00:18:05,898 --> 00:18:07,244
Kwang Soo, it's so unfair!

293
00:18:07,244 --> 00:18:10,928
Let's all make a line here...

294
00:18:10,928 --> 00:18:16,454
And face the table while Kwang Soo
chooses one person for piggyback ride!

295
00:18:16,454 --> 00:18:18,790
- Let's make this simple!
- Okay!

296
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:21,009
Don't look!
I'm making my choice!

297
00:18:21,009 --> 00:18:22,538
Speak if you must, Seung Soo!

298
00:18:22,538 --> 00:18:24,979
[One moment, Kwang Soo.]

299
00:18:31,332 --> 00:18:33,983
[Seung Soo's cheap trick fails.]

300
00:18:35,756 --> 00:18:39,461
That was a dirty play!
[Harsh criticisms]

301
00:18:39,461 --> 00:18:42,666
- Remove him from this round!
- Disqualified!

302
00:18:42,666 --> 00:18:45,850
Drag him out!
[He's removed from this round.]

303
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:47,191
What a dirty trick!

304
00:18:47,191 --> 00:18:52,643
Why is he holding a cell phone?
What's going on?

305
00:18:52,643 --> 00:18:55,267
[Giving him a leg split as punishment.]

306
00:18:55,267 --> 00:18:57,840
One, two, three.

307
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,079
Do it one more time!

308
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:03,588
Don't do it!
Too much!

309
00:19:07,934 --> 00:19:12,087
[Ha Ha and Kwang Soo make it
while everyone is distracted!]

310
00:19:13,588 --> 00:19:18,731
[Ha Ha and Kwang Soo win
the first mission!]

311
00:19:19,015 --> 00:19:22,923
<i>It's all because of you, Seung Soo!</i>

312
00:19:22,923 --> 00:19:27,301
[All the blame is going to Seung Soo!]

313
00:19:28,141 --> 00:19:31,074
Traitors, cross!

314
00:19:31,074 --> 00:19:33,780
What the heck were you thinking?

315
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:37,178
[Criticism against Seung Soo
is not calming down.]

316
00:19:40,899 --> 00:19:42,858
You shouldn't have let your
guard down!

317
00:19:42,858 --> 00:19:45,708
[Anyway, Ha Ha and Kwang Soo win!]

318
00:19:46,264 --> 00:19:51,916
<i>The winners of the first round
are Ha Ha and Kwang Soo!</i>

319
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:57,780
You can just hang out here
and watch them do other missions.

320
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:00,309
No problem.
This is great!

321
00:20:00,309 --> 00:20:02,659
What did I tell you?

322
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:04,933
<i>I'll give your next mission right now.</i>

323
00:20:04,933 --> 00:20:08,926
<i>The second mission is
"Talk with Your Nose."</i>

324
00:20:08,926 --> 00:20:10,685
Suk Jin is going to win then!

325
00:20:10,685 --> 00:20:13,429
[Big-nosed Brother has the best nose!]

326
00:20:13,429 --> 00:20:19,580
<i>You must go find computers with
R stickers on them...</i>

327
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:25,901
<i>and type "Snow White and the Seven Dwarves"
with your nose.</i>

328
00:20:25,901 --> 00:20:28,698
I'll end up pressing
multiple keys at the same time!

329
00:20:28,698 --> 00:20:31,029
<i>After typing, print it and return.</i>

330
00:20:31,029 --> 00:20:32,426
I don't know how to print!

331
00:20:32,426 --> 00:20:36,042
<i>The first dwarf that comes back
will be the winner.</i>

332
00:20:36,042 --> 00:20:38,320
I don't know how to print documents!

333
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,135
You can go to "File," then press "Print."

334
00:20:42,531 --> 00:20:45,356
Can you intercept someone else's paper?

335
00:20:45,356 --> 00:20:48,444
[No interception allowed]

336
00:20:48,444 --> 00:20:50,148
So how can I print again?

337
00:20:50,148 --> 00:20:52,342
Jong Kook!
Just type with your nose first...

338
00:20:52,342 --> 00:20:55,530
Then just yell out, "Print!"

339
00:20:56,246 --> 00:21:00,516
<i>There'll be only one winner in this round,
and the winner will receive the second hint.</i>

340
00:21:00,516 --> 00:21:02,312
<i>Start!</i>

341
00:21:03,539 --> 00:21:05,121
Good luck!

342
00:21:05,121 --> 00:21:07,981
No one's taking care of Kwang Soo's hat.

343
00:21:08,293 --> 00:21:11,273
[The law of game shows is about

- I wholeheartedly recommend Kwang Soo!
- I think Kwang Soo should do it!

515
00:32:34,966 --> 00:32:40,248
I guess it isn't fair to corner
one person against his will.

516
00:32:40,248 --> 00:32:42,046
So let's vote on it.

517
00:32:42,046 --> 00:32:43,849

- Yea!

518
00:32:43,849 --> 00:32:48,590
Kwang Soo should stand under the water
balloon per the result of our voting.

I think more capable people
must get that balloon first.

522
00:33:01,941 --> 00:33:05,388
Then Jae Suk, Jong Kook, and I
will start with that one.

523

693
00:43:27,664 --> 00:43:30,443
Hurry up!

694
00:43:31,502 --> 00:43:35,634
[Which balloon will explode first?]

695
00:43:40,762 --> 00:43:43,098
[Mission successful!]

696
00:43:45,674 --> 00:43:47,674
[A celebratory pop!]

697
00:43:49,403 --> 00:43:52,215
[Nice teamwork between
Snow White and the Seven Dwarves.]

698
00:43:52,215 --> 00:43:54,967
It was harder to deal with
all that nerve!

699
00:43:57,126 --> 00:44:01,645
As promised, I'll tell you where
the secret of the curse is hidden.

700
00:44:01,645 --> 00:44:04,860
But why do we have to be
cursed all the time?

701
00:44:04,860 --> 00:44:09,666
We spend our week, living innocent lives,
working hard.

702
00:44:09,666 --> 00:44:11,793
Then we come here, only to be cursed!

703
00:44:11,793 --> 00:44:14,738
What have we done to deserve
this curse?

704
00:44:14,738 --> 00:44:17,049
We all have loving families too!

705
00:44:24,328 --> 00:44:28,368
[I'll give you the hint on
where the curse's hint is located.]

706
00:44:28,368 --> 00:44:33,985
[Everyone gets the hint about
where the curse's secret is at.]

707
00:44:36,857 --> 00:44:42,085
[It's time to return to the past
to save Snow White.]

708
00:44:49,992 --> 00:44:55,877
[A small village in a forest.]

709
00:44:55,877 --> 00:45:01,048
[Dotted by many sparkling stars.]

710
00:45:01,048 --> 00:45:03,716
[The land of fairytale.]

711
00:45:04,318 --> 00:45:08,279
[Warping back to this land of fairytale!]

712
00:45:13,818 --> 00:45:18,282
[This is...]

713
00:45:18,282 --> 00:45:22,070
[The land of fairytale where they
used to live!]

714
00:45:22,070 --> 00:45:23,914
Where is Snow White?

715
00:45:23,914 --> 00:45:25,616
You were the one holding her!

716
00:45:25,616 --> 00:45:27,944
You were holding her!
Where did she go?

717
00:45:27,944 --> 00:45:30,734
Snow White!

718
00:45:33,172 --> 00:45:38,797
[Where is Snow White?]

719
00:45:38,797 --> 00:45:45,628
[In the highest place of this land,
in the most secluded room...]

720
00:45:45,628 --> 00:45:52,621
[Snow White sleeps after
eating a poisoned apple.]

721
00:45:54,556 --> 00:45:58,829
[Will the Dwarves be able to remove
Snow White's curse?]

722
00:45:58,829 --> 00:46:02,243
Where's White?
Snow White?

723
00:46:02,243 --> 00:46:04,513
Is this showing something?

724
00:46:04,513 --> 00:46:07,764
[The mirror is showing something!]

725
00:46:09,336 --> 00:46:13,413
<i>Dear Dwarves, the Princess is still asleep
somewhere in the village because of her curse.</i>

726
00:46:13,413 --> 00:46:15,455
Only a prince will be able to
wake her up.

727
00:46:15,455 --> 00:46:18,853
Only a (forehead) kiss from the prince
can wake the princess...

728
00:46:18,853 --> 00:46:24,776
And the only surviving dwarf may bring
the prince to the princess.

729
00:46:24,776 --> 00:46:28,892
So one of the dwarves must go with the
prince to wake her up.

730
00:46:28,892 --> 00:46:31,084
After ousting all the other dwarves!

731
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:33,640
So there is really a prince among us, right?

732
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:35,606
The Prince himself doesn't know it yet.

733
00:46:35,606 --> 00:46:41,396
Even to the prince, it'd be most beneficial
to reserve a dwarf that's most likely to survive...

734
00:46:41,396 --> 00:46:44,487
Don't assume that it'll be you!

735
00:46:44,487 --> 00:46:46,570
At least from the prince's perspective...

736
00:46:46,570 --> 00:46:50,279
If you keep behaving like this,
all the dwarves will unite against you!

737
00:46:50,279 --> 00:46:51,980
He should go first!

738
00:46:51,980 --> 00:46:55,479
Be careful!
Stop provoking us!

739
00:46:55,479 --> 00:46:58,512
Seung Soo has decided
that he's the prince already.

740
00:46:59,819 --> 00:47:01,957
[Is it obvious?]

741
00:47:01,957 --> 00:47:03,621
You're not!

742
00:47:03,621 --> 00:47:05,858
You're just conceited!

743
00:47:05,858 --> 00:47:08,783
Shouldn't something like this
be decided by age?

744
00:47:08,783 --> 00:47:12,490
Unfortunately, the witch has
cursed all of your dwarves.

745
00:47:12,490 --> 00:47:17,183
The curse will have each one of you
to be ousted in an unique way.

746
00:47:17,183 --> 00:47:22,000
Use the hints from the future
to figure out the truth of the curse.

747
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:28,068
And there are many pieces of gold, your
favorite metal, hidden throughout this town.

748
00:47:28,068 --> 00:47:32,352
You'll be able to keep them
when you find them!

749
00:47:32,352 --> 00:47:36,152
Once you oust other dwarves,
you may keep their gold too.

750
00:47:36,152 --> 00:47:37,737
It's over!

751
00:47:37,737 --> 00:47:41,840
But if someone removes the prince's name tag,
he'll be ousted and thus can't remove the curse.

752
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:42,866
So be careful.

753
00:47:42,866 --> 00:47:44,659
We need to know whom the prince is.

754
00:47:44,659 --> 00:47:46,590
So we can't oust the prince

755
00:47:46,590 --> 00:47:49,822
and the way to oust other dwarves is
something other than removing the name tags.

756
00:47:49,824 --> 00:47:56,047
I believe that you'll find the prince
to break the curse and save the princess!

757
00:47:56,047 --> 00:47:58,370
I'm just going to focus on
mining the gold.

758
00:47:58,370 --> 00:48:01,699
I'll have him find all the gold
and then oust him!

759
00:48:02,330 --> 00:48:05,221
Leave Suk Jin alone so he
can find gold.

760
00:48:05,221 --> 00:48:09,855
Once he has enough gold,
find the way to oust him.

761
00:48:11,745 --> 00:48:13,545
So how can I oust other dwarves?

762
00:48:13,545 --> 00:48:17,637
You have it in your envelope.
You need to figure that out.

763
00:48:18,546 --> 00:48:22,351
I have the way to oust Suk Jin right here.

the place, and one about the prince!]

00:48:37,886 --> 00:48:39,637
I think you're the prince.

767
00:48:39,637 --> 00:48:40,652
Do you think so?

768
00:48:40,652 --> 00:48:43,821
I represent all short people.

769
00:48:43,821 --> 00:48:47,732
- I'll serve you well.
- Sure...

770
00:48:50,135 --> 00:48:55,041

The Prince is not very bright.
[Big-nosed Brother's hint]

781

That's not a good hint.
Everyone in the group isn't bright!

782
00:49:46,740 --> 00:49:50,884
Who could it be?
Gary?

783
00:49:50,884 --> 00:49:55,372
Gary, Kwang Soo...
I'm feeling something.

784
00:49:55,372 --> 00:49:57,842

[It's not you.]

786

What the heck is this?

787
00:50:05,223 --> 00:50:08,881
So I'm not the prince.
I knew it.

788
00:50:08,881 --> 00:50:12,247
What is this?

789

Someone will be ousted if
his hair is pulled out.

793
00:50:24,889 --> 00:50:29,064
This curse can only oust a specific person,
and the way to oust each dwarf is unique.

794
00:50:29,064 --> 00:50:34,541
You don't know to whom this curse applies,
so you should be careful on how to use this.

Someone will be ousted if he gets flicked
in his forehead by a hand in an apple glove.

798
00:50:49,028 --> 00:50:53,312
Someone will be ousted if I flick that person's
forehead while wearing an apple glove.

799
00:50:54,050 --> 00:50:57,683
Should I try flicking my own forehead?
[Apple Glove = Regular Glove]

it's over.

It'd be so unfair for me
to be ousted like this!

802
00:51:07,589 --> 00:51:09,746
Should I do it?

803
00:51:12,648 --> 00:51:15,622

[So happy to live longer]

805
00:51:17,786 --> 00:51:23,241
But I shouldn't use it right away.
I should wait and see first.

How can I force someone like Kwang Soo
to split his legs?

816
00:52:12,439 --> 00:52:17,213
If I'm really the prince,
I won't kiss her forehead!

He looks like he did something.

- Don't betray me.

860
00:54:57,313 --> 00:54:59,683
I'll never betray you.

861
00:54:59,683 --> 00:55:02,346
I think you'll do one.
A big one.

862
00:55:02,346 --> 00:55:05,839
I think I'm the prince too...

863
00:55:06,644 --> 00:55:10,258
Shall we take a picture
to commemorate our alliance?

864
00:55:10,258 --> 00:55:13,378
To swear that we'll
never betray each other.

865
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:15,964
- No betrayal, okay?
- Okay.

866
00:55:23,183 --> 00:55:24,685
<i>The Witch's Curse...</i>

867
00:55:24,685 --> 00:55:31,574
Someone will be ousted if he gets flicked
in the forehead by a hand in an apple glove.

868
00:55:31,574 --> 00:55:36,427
Someone will be ousted if I flick that person's
forehead while wearing an apple glove.

869
00:55:40,348 --> 00:55:45,100
[Cocked and loaded]

870
00:55:45,444 --> 00:55:47,177
What are you doing?

871
00:55:48,775 --> 00:55:50,575
What are you doing?

872
00:55:50,575 --> 00:55:53,768
[The alliance dissolved in 30 seconds.]

873
00:55:53,768 --> 00:55:58,336
I was just making a peace sign!
A peace sign!

874
00:55:58,336 --> 00:55:59,341
- Hey!
- What?

875
00:55:59,341 --> 00:56:03,076
I saw you.
I saw what you were doing.

876
00:56:03,076 --> 00:56:06,431
- You were trying to flick me!
- Stop this nonsense!

877
00:56:06,431 --> 00:56:08,632
Do you think I'd be that stupid?

878
00:56:08,632 --> 00:56:12,635
- I saw you with my own eyes!
- No, that's not the case.

879
00:56:12,635 --> 00:56:16,491
What did they do?
[Kook Dwarf appears]

880
00:56:16,491 --> 00:56:18,808
- That's a scary guy right there!
- Excuse me.

881
00:56:18,808 --> 00:56:22,325
You'll be so surprised when I tell you
what my first-place hint is.

882
00:56:22,325 --> 00:56:25,502
He's just like a snake!

883
00:56:31,133 --> 00:56:33,450
[Go away!]

884
00:56:36,143 --> 00:56:39,755
I think he's going to get me!

885
00:56:41,304 --> 00:56:44,296
I think it's possible
that you're the prince.

886
00:56:44,296 --> 00:56:45,918
Then let's talk.

887
00:56:45,918 --> 00:56:49,999
Let's share the hints on
the prince then.

888
00:56:49,999 --> 00:56:52,865
Let's take them out.

889
00:56:52,865 --> 00:56:57,107
- Let's take a look.
- One, two, three!

890
00:56:58,268 --> 00:57:01,496
- Let me see!
- I can only read some words!

891
00:57:02,627 --> 00:57:04,588
Here, the Prince is...

892
00:57:04,588 --> 00:57:07,096
We can't see Kwang Soo's yet.

893
00:57:07,096 --> 00:57:10,058
Can you really not trust us?
After four years?

894
00:57:10,058 --> 00:57:12,464
I can show you this much.
So you should show me more.

895
00:57:12,464 --> 00:57:16,697
I'll show you.
This is why I think you're the Prince.

896
00:57:16,697 --> 00:57:17,996
I'll only show you.

897
00:57:17,996 --> 00:57:19,401
Let me see too!

898
00:57:19,401 --> 00:57:22,325
[Not very bright]

899
00:57:22,561 --> 00:57:24,802
Let me see!
[That must be me.]

900
00:57:24,802 --> 00:57:27,826
We'll all see together!

901
00:57:27,857 --> 00:57:30,284
Let me see too!
Damn, Jae Suk!

902
00:57:30,284 --> 00:57:31,467
Damn, Jae Suk!

903
00:57:31,467 --> 00:57:36,480
What's he doing?
He keeps repeating it!

904
00:57:38,437 --> 00:57:41,183
[5 minutes ago]

905
00:57:41,183 --> 00:57:45,858
Someone will be ousted if he gets flicked
in his forehead by a hand in an apple glove.

906
00:57:49,148 --> 00:57:52,107
I'll oust everyone!
[Burning]

907
00:57:52,536 --> 00:57:54,761
Let me see too!
Damn, Jae Suk!

908
00:57:54,761 --> 00:57:57,527
[The first testing subject]
[Yoo Jae Suk]

909
00:57:58,284 --> 00:58:00,449
Are you trying to kill us with this?

910
00:58:00,449 --> 00:58:02,704
Then I'm going to do the same thing!

911
00:58:02,704 --> 00:58:05,559
- I'll do the same!
- Hold on!

912
00:58:05,655 --> 00:58:08,014
- Don't let him join us.
- Let's read it together...

913
00:58:08,014 --> 00:58:09,545
Then let me see!

914
00:58:09,545 --> 00:58:12,593
[Kwang Soo's First Place hint is...]
[The Prince is a human.]

915
00:58:12,593 --> 00:58:14,178
That's so useless!

916
00:58:14,178 --> 00:58:17,771
This is really all I have!

917
00:58:17,771 --> 00:58:20,860
- Get out of here! Leave!
- But this is really all I have!

918
00:58:20,860 --> 00:58:24,302
You should get up to and go film him.

919
00:58:25,034 --> 00:58:27,922
Go!
Just leave!

920
00:58:28,740 --> 00:58:32,505
Just get lost!

921
00:58:32,505 --> 00:58:36,746
You must believe me.
It was there when I opened my bag!

922
00:58:38,624 --> 00:58:40,578
So if it's neither you nor Kwang Soo...
Who else?

923
00:58:40,578 --> 00:58:41,756
Just go!

924
00:58:41,756 --> 00:58:44,068
We'll have enough information
among us.

925
00:58:44,068 --> 00:58:46,704
Let's switch.

926
00:58:47,349 --> 00:58:51,030
[Not very bright]
[The Prince speaks eloquently]

927
00:58:51,030 --> 00:58:52,479
There's nothing in common...

928
00:58:52,479 --> 00:58:56,784
They're irrelevant. Only because he's this,
that doesn't mean that he can't be that.

929
00:58:56,784 --> 00:58:58,996
Then who could it be?

930
00:58:58,996 --> 00:59:02,548
- You can speak eloquently.
- I think it's this guy.

931
00:59:02,548 --> 00:59:05,600
Yes, if we have to make an inference
from the clues...

932
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:09,274
It's either that guy
or this guy.

933
00:59:09,274 --> 00:59:10,909
But he can't talk that well.

934
00:59:10,909 --> 00:59:12,213
That's true.

935
00:59:12,213 --> 00:59:15,205
He can speak eloquently.
He's very good at rapping.

936
00:59:15,205 --> 00:59:19,183
I don't know what you're talking about,
but I can talk well too!

937
00:59:19,183 --> 00:59:21,916
You only know how to
make sounds and scream!

938
00:59:21,916 --> 00:59:24,136
Would you please leave?

939
00:59:24,910 --> 00:59:28,133
This guy is the prince.
He must be.

940
00:59:28,168 --> 00:59:30,130
You're the prince!

941
00:59:30,130 --> 00:59:36,157
"Not very bright" is probably
only about your character in this show.

942
00:59:36,157 --> 00:59:39,038
So I think it's highly likely
that it's you.

943
00:59:39,038 --> 00:59:40,626
So then what should I do?

944
00:59:40,626 --> 00:59:44,871
You should stay here because
you're the prince.

945
00:59:44,871 --> 00:59:47,773
I'll be back after
ousting all other dwarves.

946
00:59:47,773 --> 00:59:49,126
Just relax.

947
00:59:49,126 --> 00:59:50,265
So love for everyone?

948
00:59:50,265 --> 00:59:52,679
- If I come back first, you're going with me.
- Of course!

949
00:59:52,679 --> 00:59:53,810
I'm open to anything.

950
00:59:53,810 --> 00:59:57,563
The goal is to make you live
and save the princess.

951
01:00:01,074 --> 01:00:04,608
[Where are you, my prince?]

952
01:00:04,608 --> 01:00:07,367
You only have the half
of the first-place hint, right?

953
01:00:07,367 --> 01:00:11,571
- You know that everyone has a full hint, right?
- That's why I've been looking for you.

954
01:00:11,571 --> 01:00:14,386
- Is this going to be the last?
- Yes.

955
01:00:16,263 --> 01:00:18,650
[Combining their hints will be
quite powerful!]

956
01:00:18,650 --> 01:00:22,654
So we'll reveal at the same time.
Our half-hints...

957
01:00:22,654 --> 01:00:26,112
You might be the prince.
I might be the prince.

958
01:00:26,112 --> 01:00:28,183
If so, then we're meant to be together.

959
01:00:28,183 --> 01:00:33,221
It might be that none of the others
is the prince.

960
01:00:33,221 --> 01:00:36,159
[Not a very trustworthy union between
two traitors...]

961
01:00:36,159 --> 01:00:38,039
Then let me get a flick!

962
01:00:38,039 --> 01:00:42,414
You want to test me?
I might die!

963
01:00:42,414 --> 01:00:44,805
Everything will be over
once we know the prince.

964
01:00:44,805 --> 01:00:53,552
But the others are guessing between
me, Gary, and Seung Soo.

965
01:00:53,552 --> 01:00:55,743
Those are the candidates.

966
01:00:55,743 --> 01:00:59,461
- Let's take out our hints.
- You know you can't tell anyone, right?

967
01:00:59,461 --> 01:01:02,811
Take it out.

968
01:01:04,031 --> 01:01:07,437
[Reuniting half-hints!]

969
01:01:09,597 --> 01:01:12,788
[The Prince is a human, and he smells.]
[A decisive hint.]

970
01:01:12,788 --> 01:01:16,814
[The Prince is a human, and he smells.]

971
01:01:16,814 --> 01:01:19,026
Just think about it.

972
01:01:19,026 --> 01:01:23,384
[Human Scent is Gary's newest song.]

973
01:01:24,679 --> 01:01:30,485
It's Gary.
[So, the Prince must be...]

974
01:01:30,485 --> 01:01:35,090
[Gary with his scent!]

975
01:01:35,393 --> 01:01:43,156
[Dear Prince, please wake me up.]

976
01:01:43,921 --> 01:01:46,907
Kwang Soo's hint made it obvious.

977
01:01:46,907 --> 01:01:49,471
He's a human...

978
01:01:49,471 --> 01:01:55,147
and the fact that I could infer the next part
means I can be eloquent!

979
01:01:55,147 --> 01:01:59,550
And I'm not that bright
because I'm very simple!

980
01:01:59,550 --> 01:02:02,705
But it's me, Kang Gary!

981
01:02:02,705 --> 01:02:05,273
I'm a prince, but I don't
even have an entourage!

982
01:02:06,052 --> 01:02:09,180
Where could the princess be at?

983
01:02:09,180 --> 01:02:11,458
Good evening, sir.

984
01:02:11,458 --> 01:02:14,267
It's fine.
I feel a bit uncomfortable.

985
01:02:14,267 --> 01:02:17,650
- I feel very uncomfortable.
- We want you to be relaxed.

986
01:02:17,650 --> 01:02:21,593
Don't make the Prince any more tired.
You're just annoying him even further!

987
01:02:21,593 --> 01:02:23,236
Do you know what I don't like?

988
01:02:23,236 --> 01:02:28,285
I hate the fact that you'll betray me in a heartbeat
if I turn out to be not the prince.

989
01:02:28,285 --> 01:02:31,275
You can leave him up to me and relax,
my dear prince.

990
01:02:31,275 --> 01:02:34,143
I don't feel comfortable around you either.

991
01:02:34,143 --> 01:02:39,432
I can't go too far away from you.
I won't go too far, Prince!

992
01:02:39,432 --> 01:02:42,182
- What did you talk about?
- It's something funny.

993
01:02:42,182 --> 01:02:44,825
- Why are you smiling?
- Take a seat.

994
01:02:44,825 --> 01:02:49,262
[Bluffing Dwarf still thinks he's the prince!]

995
01:02:49,262 --> 01:02:52,647
For Seung Soo,
we need someone powerful.

996
01:02:52,647 --> 01:02:57,002
[Let's get him]

997
01:03:03,226 --> 01:03:07,212
We shouldn't do anything on Gary
because he's probably the Prince!

998
01:03:07,212 --> 01:03:09,397
He won't die anyway!

999
01:03:09,397 --> 01:03:13,047
- Hey!
- What?

1000
01:03:15,477 --> 01:03:20,772
[Now he realized what's going on.]
[But it's too late!]

1001
01:03:20,772 --> 01:03:25,053
Sit down first!

1002
01:03:25,053 --> 01:03:27,088
I'll begin with my treatment!

1003
01:03:27,088 --> 01:03:29,278
I want to do it!

1004
01:03:29,278 --> 01:03:31,405
[Fighting to go first in front of him.]

1005
01:03:31,405 --> 01:03:34,487
I'll be quick!

1006
01:03:35,557 --> 01:03:38,429
- That's it?
- It didn't work.

1007
01:03:38,429 --> 01:03:40,373
He's not out?

1008
01:03:42,109 --> 01:03:44,496
- Mine will take a while.
- Do it!

1009
01:03:44,496 --> 01:03:48,787
I'm not it, right?
I'm not it!

1010
01:03:52,583 --> 01:03:55,045
[Big-nosed Dwarf tries the belt
on Prince Gary!]

1011
01:03:55,045 --> 01:03:58,712
He's fine!
He's not out?

1012
01:03:58,712 --> 01:04:01,631
[Tattered]

1013
01:04:01,977 --> 01:04:08,982
[Immediately changing their target to
Big-nosed Brother!]

1014
01:04:10,979 --> 01:04:16,463
- Get him!
- Don't do it!

1015
01:04:16,463 --> 01:04:20,850
There's no other choice.
I must give him a midair split.

1016
01:04:24,821 --> 01:04:30,528
[Perhaps?]

1017
01:04:30,528 --> 01:04:34,958
[The sound of crows fills
the land of fairytale.]

1018
01:04:34,958 --> 01:04:39,382
[Ji Suk Jin, out]

1019
01:04:39,382 --> 01:04:42,628
You should do it, too!

1020
01:04:42,628 --> 01:04:46,222
[Now the oldest brother is gone,
the second oldest is the next!]

1021
01:04:46,222 --> 01:04:50,144
Prince!
Prince Gary!

1022
01:04:50,911 --> 01:04:54,686
It'll be over soon!
Just hold still!

1023
01:05:02,839 --> 01:05:05,957
It tickles so much!

1024
01:05:05,957 --> 01:05:08,904
It'll be over soon!

1025
01:05:08,904 --> 01:05:12,467
Seung Soo!
Grab his foot!

1026
01:05:13,838 --> 01:05:19,038
[Seung Soo is trying the pillow on Gary
instead of grabbing Jae Suk.]

1027
01:05:20,760 --> 01:05:22,068
["Out" written on Jae Suk's foot.]

1028
01:05:22,068 --> 01:05:24,635
What are you doing?

1029
01:05:25,055 --> 01:05:27,659
What's going on?

1030
01:05:32,270 --> 01:05:36,735
[The sound of crows again!]

1031
01:05:36,735 --> 01:05:41,515
[Yoo Jae Suk, out]

1032
01:05:41,515 --> 01:05:45,089
Which one ousted him?

1033
01:05:45,089 --> 01:05:48,499
You did tell me you'll give me your foot
voluntarily.

1034
01:05:48,499 --> 01:05:52,482
Don't you think this
was a bit to much, Prince?

1035
01:05:53,836 --> 01:05:56,399
- So the split was you, Suk Jin.
- It's me?

1036
01:05:56,399 --> 01:05:59,540
- Please give your gold to Jae Suk...
- Why did you pick me?

1037
01:05:59,540 --> 01:06:04,668
Then everything that Jae Suk has
should go to Gary.

1038
01:06:04,668 --> 01:06:07,095
Gary must be the prince!

1039
01:06:09,677 --> 01:06:13,321
So writing on the foot was for you, Jae Suk.

1040
01:06:14,364 --> 01:06:17,965
- So where's the champion's belt?
- It's in there.

1041
01:06:17,965 --> 01:06:21,847
So this is just about the Prince
getting stronger and kissing the princess!

1042
01:06:21,847 --> 01:06:25,890
It's not just a kiss!
That's not how it should be treated!

1043
01:06:25,890 --> 01:06:28,469
It'll be to cure the princess!

1044
01:06:38,732 --> 01:06:43,365
[In the meantime, Giraffe successfully tricked
Muscle Dwarf to believe that he's the prince.]

1045
01:06:43,365 --> 01:06:46,138
He might really be the prince.
Then please save me!

1046
01:06:46,257 --> 01:06:49,272
Yes, that's why I've asked you!

1047
01:06:49,272 --> 01:06:52,375
Even if you join forces with Seung Soo...

1048
01:06:52,375 --> 01:06:55,706
Kwang Soo really must be the Prince!

1049
01:06:57,570 --> 01:07:00,330
There're many things that
require the Prince's attention.

1050
01:07:00,330 --> 01:07:07,599
I had never expected the way to the princess
would be this far and difficult!

1051
01:07:11,023 --> 01:07:13,543
Why are you acting sketchy?

1052
01:07:13,543 --> 01:07:19,283
[The Dwarves are getting suspicious of each other...]

1053
01:07:19,753 --> 01:07:22,757
- Have you put the pillow on yourself?
- Yes, I have!

1054
01:07:22,757 --> 01:07:26,118
- He never tied it around his neck.
- Do you want me to show you?

1055
01:07:27,102 --> 01:07:34,265
[Could it be that Bluffing Dwarf's own tool
is meant for his own ousting?]

1056
01:07:34,265 --> 01:07:38,544
It'd be hilarious if they call
"Ryu Seung Soo, Out" right now.

1057
01:07:38,782 --> 01:07:40,148
See? Nothing happened.

1058
01:07:40,148 --> 01:07:42,112
- Hey, Kwang Soo.
- Yes?

1059
01:07:42,112 --> 01:07:49,629
[Giraffe Dwarf keeps luring in other dwarves
based on his alliance with Muscle Dwarf!]

1060
01:07:50,939 --> 01:07:55,350
[Another innocent sheep is trapped.]

1061
01:07:59,886 --> 01:08:02,096
[A flicking has already been tried]

1062
01:08:02,096 --> 01:08:05,039
[Now Kook tries his hair-pulling!]

1063
01:08:08,491 --> 01:08:10,643
Hey, what was that?

1064
01:08:10,643 --> 01:08:14,178
Nothing's happening!

1065
01:08:16,373 --> 01:08:21,094
[Immediately changing the target]

1066
01:08:21,094 --> 01:08:23,696
You can't do this to me!

1067
01:08:25,117 --> 01:08:27,916
I pulled out a lot of hair!

1068
01:08:27,916 --> 01:08:35,128
[The sound of scary crows again!]
[Is it Ha Ha or Seung Soo?]

1069
01:08:37,971 --> 01:08:41,866
- What? It's me?
- We did it!

1070
01:08:41,866 --> 01:08:44,306
[Ha Ha, out]

1071
01:08:45,647 --> 01:08:49,774
[Jong Kook Dwarf realizes that everyone except him
made through Kwang Soo's flicking]

1072
01:08:49,774 --> 01:08:53,535
[He attacks after sensing the danger!]

1073
01:08:54,403 --> 01:08:57,121
[flicking doesn't work!]

1074
01:08:57,121 --> 01:08:59,723
Listen to me!
Just listen to me!

1075
01:08:59,723 --> 01:09:03,881
[Putting Seung Soo's neck pillow on him]

1076
01:09:12,407 --> 01:09:18,002
[The sound of the crows again...]

1077
01:09:18,002 --> 01:09:20,789
I'm out?
By what?

1078
01:09:20,789 --> 01:09:23,781
It has to be the neck pillow!
We didn't do anything else!

1079
01:09:23,781 --> 01:09:26,953
[Goodbye, a tall dwarf who
defied your own fate...]

1080
01:09:32,386 --> 01:09:38,180
[Are you on your way, Prince?]

1081
01:09:38,584 --> 01:09:40,918
Now it's between us three!

1082
01:09:40,918 --> 01:09:43,664
The Good, the Bad, the Weird.

1083
01:09:43,664 --> 01:09:47,054
I've been raising a tiger cub, Seung Soo!

1084
01:09:48,771 --> 01:09:56,873
[Only the Prince and one dwarf
can go to the princess...]

1085
01:09:56,873 --> 01:09:59,597
So now I must choose one of them.

1086
01:09:59,629 --> 01:10:05,251
But why am I no longer convinced
thant I'm the Prince?

1087
01:10:05,251 --> 01:10:09,301
What if I'm not the Prince?
[Overcome by uncertainty.]

1088
01:10:09,301 --> 01:10:11,313
[And a dwarf who's still misguided.]

1089
01:10:11,313 --> 01:10:14,846
I think I'm the Prince.

1090
01:10:15,655 --> 01:10:19,294
There's no reason for a dwarf to oust
the Prince.

1091
01:10:19,294 --> 01:10:21,939
I can't possible afford
to risk removing the name tags.

1092
01:10:21,939 --> 01:10:27,378
At least I know that I'm not the Prince.
So it's one of those two.

1093
01:10:27,378 --> 01:10:30,332
It's quite narrow.

1094
01:10:30,903 --> 01:10:32,589
Where are you going?

1095
01:10:32,589 --> 01:10:35,678
<i>I'm going to you.</i>

1096
01:10:35,678 --> 01:10:37,553
You've done well to
survive this far.

1097
01:10:37,553 --> 01:10:40,557
Right?
My vitality is my strong suit!

1098
01:10:41,024 --> 01:10:43,822
I'm afraid it'll have to end soon.

1099
01:10:43,822 --> 01:10:45,556
I think you're the prince.

1100
01:10:45,556 --> 01:10:51,130
And we can't beat Jong Kook unless
we unite our forces together.

1101
01:10:51,130 --> 01:10:53,185
You're certain that you're the prince.

1102
01:10:53,185 --> 01:10:58,543
I knew I'd be the prince from the moment
Ji Hyo became the princess.

1103
01:10:58,543 --> 01:11:02,892
So I must face Jong Kook by myself?

1104
01:11:03,689 --> 01:11:05,577
- Seung Soo...
- Yes?

1105
01:11:05,577 --> 01:11:12,858
My goal right now is
waking Ji Hyo up as soon as possible.

1106
01:11:12,858 --> 01:11:18,317
Yes, we must wake her up quickly!
And I can't face Jong Kook by myself.

1107
01:11:18,317 --> 01:11:22,233
- My goal is...
- I see.

1108
01:11:22,975 --> 01:11:24,089
You're fine!

1109
01:11:24,089 --> 01:11:26,811
I don't like the principle
of your doing this.

1110
01:11:26,811 --> 01:11:28,951
See?
You're fine!

1111
01:11:28,951 --> 01:11:31,587
How dare you hit the forehead
of the Prince?

1112
01:11:31,587 --> 01:11:35,017
I may not look like the Prince,
but isn't this still impertinent?

1113
01:11:35,017 --> 01:11:36,687
I'm sorry.

1114
01:11:36,687 --> 01:11:38,868
You may get up.

1115
01:11:38,868 --> 01:11:42,217
You're not it.
So it must be Jong Kook.

1116
01:11:42,541 --> 01:11:46,874
No alliance!

1117
01:11:46,874 --> 01:11:48,941
Let's just get rid of him.

1118
01:11:48,941 --> 01:11:50,845
How are you going to do it?

1119
01:11:50,845 --> 01:11:54,202
You must have it with you right now.

1120
01:11:54,202 --> 01:11:55,427
I do have something.

1121
01:11:55,427 --> 01:12:01,996
I do think Gary is the Prince.
But he's not helping me out.

1122
01:12:01,996 --> 01:12:09,342
My fighting against Jong Kook would
be like David going up against Goliath...

1123
01:12:11,209 --> 01:12:14,155
He'll be a very difficult opponent.

1124
01:12:14,155 --> 01:12:17,789
- Hey, Gary?
- Yes, Jong Kook.

1125
01:12:18,205 --> 01:12:21,577
[It seems like Kook Dwarf wants to
say something.]

1126
01:12:21,577 --> 01:12:26,665
Is...
Is there someone else?

1127
01:12:26,665 --> 01:12:29,040
There's no one.

1128
01:12:32,048 --> 01:12:36,748
Something's weird.

1129
01:12:36,948 --> 01:12:40,359
[This weird feeling...]

1130
01:12:42,077 --> 01:12:47,556
It can't be that the princess is
sleeping out on the streets, right?

1131
01:12:48,169 --> 01:12:50,625
[Seung Soo is trying to find
Blank Ji Princess first.]

1132
01:12:50,625 --> 01:12:53,775
Where is this woman sleeping?

1133
01:12:57,566 --> 01:13:01,363
But at this moment...

1134
01:13:03,804 --> 01:13:06,468
I think there's someone else.

1135
01:13:10,169 --> 01:13:12,978
I don't see Seung Soo either.

1136
01:13:17,108 --> 01:13:21,941
[Men in black capes!]

1137
01:13:23,560 --> 01:13:30,601
[Who are these men?]

1138
01:13:31,006 --> 01:13:33,171
Something's weird.

1139
01:13:33,171 --> 01:13:35,881
[What is this weird feeling?]

1140
01:13:37,937 --> 01:13:43,435
[And a black shadow that appears
from the back...]

1141
01:13:43,435 --> 01:13:50,652
[Then hugs Seung Soo Dwarf...]

1142
01:13:50,652 --> 01:13:59,102
[Who is this person?]

1143
01:14:12,093 --> 01:14:17,650
It's also weird that there's
no sign of Ji Hyo.

1144
01:14:17,650 --> 01:14:19,584
[Wait...]

1145
01:14:43,201 --> 01:14:48,708
[Song Ji Hyo]

1146
01:14:48,708 --> 01:14:53,191
[Why is she here?]

1147
01:14:55,425 --> 01:15:00,716
What's her true identity?

1148
01:15:02,170 --> 01:15:10,066
[Ji Hyo, the Snow White that we know, fell
asleep after eating a poisoned apple...]

1149
01:15:12,642 --> 01:15:18,365
[She's opening her eyes!]

1150
01:15:18,365 --> 01:15:21,479
[The real identity of Snow White is...]

1151
01:15:21,479 --> 01:15:27,870
[The Witch!]

1152
01:15:28,696 --> 01:15:33,036
<i>The sleeping Snow White was
just an act from Ji Hyo the Witch.</i>

1153
01:15:33,084 --> 01:15:36,767
<i>Yes, that's what the Dwarves think.</i>

1154
01:15:41,090 --> 01:15:49,386
<i>The Witch pretended to be Snow White
to steal gold from the dwarves.</i>

1155
01:15:57,708 --> 01:16:01,429
The dwarves have been ousted.

1156
01:16:02,452 --> 01:16:05,836
[Time to get to work.]

1157
01:16:07,584 --> 01:16:15,431
[The Witch was in total control even
when everyone thought she was sleeping.]

1158
01:16:15,431 --> 01:16:25,041
[The rift and demise between the dwarves
are exactly what the Witch wanted.]

1159
01:16:27,684 --> 01:16:31,415
Everyone's confused by my curse.

1160
01:16:31,415 --> 01:16:39,985
My world is coming!

1161
01:16:41,721 --> 01:16:48,794
[All out curses were created by the Witch.]

1162
01:16:48,794 --> 01:16:54,063
[She waited until Seung Soo Dwarf
got separated from the group...]

1163
01:16:54,063 --> 01:16:57,781
[Then waited for him with
the Champion belt, his out curse.]

1164
01:16:57,781 --> 01:17:02,864
Now that your belt is on your waist,
it's time for you to go to jail.

1165
01:17:02,864 --> 01:17:04,898
- Am I dead?
- Yes.

1166
01:17:04,898 --> 01:17:06,770
- Really?
- Yes.

1167
01:17:10,505 --> 01:17:15,128
[Ryu Seung Soo, Out]

1168
01:17:15,128 --> 01:17:20,584
[The sound of the crows is the sign
of the Witch's existence!]

1169
01:17:20,584 --> 01:17:23,691
See?

1170
01:17:23,691 --> 01:17:25,026
Gary...

1171
01:17:25,026 --> 01:17:28,211
It could be that Gary has
allied with someone else...

1172
01:17:28,211 --> 01:17:32,996
Wait, Seung Soo couldn't possibly
be ousted by Gary.

1173
01:17:34,995 --> 01:17:43,666
[The Witch is putting the crown and Seung Soo's
magic book as bait for the Prince.]

1174
01:17:43,666 --> 01:17:48,230
[Please come to me, Prince.]

1175
01:17:49,962 --> 01:17:52,140
Prince Gary!

1176
01:17:52,777 --> 01:17:55,992
Gary!
The Prince!

1177
01:17:55,992 --> 01:17:58,429
Where are you?
Who are you with?

1178
01:17:58,429 --> 01:18:01,008
What is he wearing?
A crown?

1179
01:18:02,162 --> 01:18:05,659
What is this?
Wait a minute!

1180
01:18:10,263 --> 01:18:16,374
I guess this is how I become
a real prince!

1181
01:18:18,915 --> 01:18:22,558
[The black feather is the Witch's symbol.]

1182
01:18:22,558 --> 01:18:26,978
[Everything is going as planned.]

1183
01:18:28,254 --> 01:18:32,869
Jong Kook Dwarf!

1184
01:18:32,869 --> 01:18:36,127
- Hey, Prince!
- Jong Kook Dwarf!

1185
01:18:36,127 --> 01:18:40,528
Wait a minute! Shouldn't
you be more careful with that crown?

1186
01:18:41,924 --> 01:18:45,811
Did you oust Seung Soo?

1187
01:18:45,811 --> 01:18:49,385
- I thought you did.
- No, I didn't!

1188
01:18:49,583 --> 01:18:52,786
- Wait, don't come any closer.
- Jong Kook Dwarf...

1189
01:18:52,786 --> 01:18:54,421
Just don't come any closer!

1190
01:18:54,421 --> 01:18:57,045
- Why should I stay away from you?
- Don't come any closer!

1191
01:18:57,045 --> 01:18:58,864
Just stay where you are!

1192
01:18:58,864 --> 01:19:00,482
You didn't oust him?

1193
01:19:00,482 --> 01:19:02,072
No, I didn't!

1194
01:19:02,072 --> 01:19:06,254
- You really didn't do it?
- I didn't!

1195
01:19:06,254 --> 01:19:08,381
You know I can't lie!

1196
01:19:08,381 --> 01:19:11,487
Did you conspire all this with
the Princess?

1197
01:19:11,487 --> 01:19:13,276
I didn't do it, Jong Kook!

1198
01:19:13,276 --> 01:19:16,114
Just sit down.
What's going on right now?

1199
01:19:16,156 --> 01:19:19,097
Why are you avoiding eye contact?

1200
01:19:19,097 --> 01:19:21,664
Gary! The Thai Prince!
[Eyes wide open]

1201
01:19:23,926 --> 01:19:25,758
The Thai Prince claims his innocence!

1202
01:19:25,758 --> 01:19:28,705
I must think clearly.
There's a third person...

1203
01:19:28,705 --> 01:19:30,030
Hey, Gary...

1204
01:19:30,522 --> 01:19:33,098
- What is it?
- Gary...

1205
01:19:33,098 --> 01:19:38,222
Why are you wearing that glove
if you didn't oust Seung Soo?

1206
01:19:38,222 --> 01:19:40,753
This has nothing to do with
me, Jong Kook!

1207
01:19:40,753 --> 01:19:42,195
Gary...

1208
01:19:42,195 --> 01:19:44,608
I found this glove from this bag!

1209
01:19:44,608 --> 01:19:47,985
That glove belongs to Seung Soo...

1210
01:19:48,757 --> 01:19:51,714
No, Jong Kook.
I didn't oust him!

1211
01:19:51,714 --> 01:19:53,459
Look at me straight, Jong Kook.

1212
01:19:53,459 --> 01:19:56,747
You can tell right away when I'm lying!

1213
01:19:56,747 --> 01:20:01,530
[But right at that moment...]

1214
01:20:01,530 --> 01:20:07,238
[Once they realized the identity of the Witch,
the dwarves all ran to her to rip her name tag off.]

1215
01:20:09,513 --> 01:20:14,159
[The message has popped up
on every mirror in town!]

1216
01:20:16,887 --> 01:20:21,668
[If only they notice the message...]

1217
01:20:21,668 --> 01:20:24,963
[They have no clue.]

1218
01:20:25,377 --> 01:20:28,774
Everything will be over once I find Ji Hyo
and kiss her.

1219
01:20:28,774 --> 01:20:30,695
It'll just be a forehead kiss.

1220
01:20:30,695 --> 01:20:35,350
- Whatever.
- A forehead kiss!

1221
01:20:35,350 --> 01:20:37,895
Let's really try to find Ji Hyo.

1222
01:20:37,895 --> 01:20:42,203
- Then I want you to go in front of me.
- Sure.

1223
01:20:43,279 --> 01:20:46,372
Let's think about where the Princess could be
if she's asleep...

1224
01:20:46,372 --> 01:20:48,346
Wait!

1225
01:20:48,346 --> 01:20:52,294
That's right. At least you
should be on the same wavelength!

1226
01:20:53,479 --> 01:20:55,990
This way.

1227
01:20:59,515 --> 01:21:05,440
[They had no idea...]

1228
01:21:05,440 --> 01:21:08,461
[of what was waiting for them.]

1229
01:21:09,477 --> 01:21:12,501
Hey, something's not right.

1230
01:21:12,501 --> 01:21:16,384
Hey, who appears in
the Snow White the fairytale?

1231
01:21:16,384 --> 01:21:18,735
- The seven dwarves.
- And who else?

1232
01:21:18,735 --> 01:21:20,295
- The Prince.
- And who else?

1233
01:21:20,295 --> 01:21:25,862
The Witch!
There's a witch in the fairytale!

1234
01:21:25,862 --> 01:21:27,280
Remember the mirror?

1235
01:21:27,280 --> 01:21:30,193
"Mirror, mirror, who's the fairest of them all?"
"Snow White!"

1236
01:21:30,193 --> 01:21:31,432
Don't do this, I'm getting scared.

1237
01:21:31,432 --> 01:21:34,929
That's why the Witch wanted to kill
Snow White!

1238
01:21:34,929 --> 01:21:39,624
I'm getting goosebumps.
Really, I am!

1239
01:21:39,624 --> 01:21:41,180
The Witch, Gary.

1240
01:21:41,180 --> 01:21:43,442
"Mirror, mirror,
who's the fairest of them all?"

1241
01:21:43,442 --> 01:21:46,032
- Stop it!
- "Snow White!"

1242
01:21:46,032 --> 01:21:49,168
That's why the Witch fed Snow White
the poisoned apple!

1243
01:21:49,168 --> 01:21:51,047
I'm a prince!

1244
01:21:51,047 --> 01:21:55,488
The Prince, the dwarves, Snow White...

1245
01:21:55,488 --> 01:21:59,163
But the Witch?

1246
01:22:01,756 --> 01:22:05,705
[Ji Hyo the Witch is pretending to be asleep.]

1247
01:22:05,705 --> 01:22:07,065
Be careful...

1248
01:22:07,065 --> 01:22:09,150
I'm scared of you too!

1249
01:22:09,150 --> 01:22:12,119
Why would I oust you?
Everything will be over if I do it!

1250
01:22:12,119 --> 01:22:15,202
- But still...
- You don't trust me?

1251
01:22:15,202 --> 01:22:18,640
There's no one else
who's more honest than me.

1252
01:22:18,640 --> 01:22:21,254
- Be aware of your surroundings!
- Okay!

1253
01:22:21,254 --> 01:22:22,899
- Surroundings!
- Jong Kook!

1254
01:22:23,843 --> 01:22:26,205
She's lying here.

1255
01:22:26,205 --> 01:22:27,397
- She's lying here.
- Who is?

1256
01:22:27,397 --> 01:22:30,747
Wait here. Let me
check if she's actually sleeping.

1257
01:22:33,665 --> 01:22:37,426
She does look the prettiest
when she's asleep!

1258
01:22:37,426 --> 01:22:39,281
- I'm going to kiss her!
- Try it.

1259
01:22:39,281 --> 01:22:41,467
Everything will be over once I kiss her.

1260
01:22:42,469 --> 01:22:44,598
Should I kiss her?
Should I start?

1261
01:22:44,598 --> 01:22:45,649
Hold on.

1262
01:22:45,649 --> 01:22:47,730
- I'm going to kiss her!
- Do it!

1263
01:22:47,730 --> 01:22:49,701
Let's kiss, Gary!

1264
01:22:49,701 --> 01:22:51,706
This crown is annoying.

1265
01:22:51,706 --> 01:22:54,547
I'll be watching this side,
so do what you have to do, Gary.

1266
01:22:54,547 --> 01:22:56,006
Princess Ji Hyo!

1267
01:22:56,006 --> 01:22:59,312
You may wake up now.

1268
01:22:59,312 --> 01:23:04,088
I want to see your smile
after waking up.

1269
01:23:06,267 --> 01:23:08,466
Wait, I think I'll be ousted
if I kiss her!

1270
01:23:08,466 --> 01:23:11,441
- You'll be fine!
- I think something's weird.

1271
01:23:11,441 --> 01:23:15,426
Fine.
Please wake up!

1272
01:23:15,778 --> 01:23:20,211
[He's trying to wake her up
just like in the fairytale...]

1273
01:23:46,336 --> 01:23:51,321
[Her eyes are open!]

1274
01:23:51,321 --> 01:23:53,731
[Those of the Witch!]

1275
01:23:54,887 --> 01:23:58,573
[She couldn't help but to laugh
after seeing the Prince.]

1276
01:23:58,573 --> 01:24:01,964
This is your prince.
Please don't laugh!

1277
01:24:01,964 --> 01:24:05,834
I'm going back to sleep!

1278
01:24:07,350 --> 01:24:10,690
Just know that I'll continue to kiss you
if you fall asleep.

1279
01:24:10,690 --> 01:24:13,187
- Is this how you're going to do this?
- Yes.

1280
01:24:13,187 --> 01:24:16,225
[Ji Hyo the Witch is now awake.]

1281
01:24:16,225 --> 01:24:21,847
[Now, how can I oust these two?]

1282
01:24:21,847 --> 01:24:25,420
So is it over if I take off
Gary's name tag?

1283
01:24:25,420 --> 01:24:26,779
Why would it be over?

1284
01:24:26,779 --> 01:24:28,435
The solo victory of a dwarf!

1285
01:24:28,435 --> 01:24:32,805
Since it has come down to this,
we should put this on him, Ji Hyo.

1286
01:24:33,701 --> 01:24:39,461
[I'd appreciate it if you
fought against each other like that!]

1287
01:24:39,461 --> 01:24:41,560
- How?
- I don't know!

1288
01:24:41,560 --> 01:24:42,674
How?

1289
01:24:42,674 --> 01:24:46,607
[The Witch is trying to remove Kook
by using Prince Gary.]

1290
01:24:46,607 --> 01:24:49,746
We must hurry, Ji Hyo!

1291
01:24:49,746 --> 01:24:53,508
[The only way to get Kook out
is to flick his forehead with a glove!]

1292
01:24:53,508 --> 01:24:55,570
[Attack commences]

1293
01:24:58,338 --> 01:25:01,645
[Prince Gary's arms are too short!]

1294
01:25:01,645 --> 01:25:04,667
[The Witch takes out a pair of gloves!]

1295
01:25:08,590 --> 01:25:12,791
[Kim Jong Kook, out]

1296
01:25:18,335 --> 01:25:22,662
[Now, only the Witch
and the Prince are left.]

1297
01:25:22,662 --> 01:25:25,093
I was waiting for you to come.

1298
01:25:25,093 --> 01:25:29,396
But I couldn't go because there were
so many dwarves!

1299
01:25:29,396 --> 01:25:30,477
Then you just showed up...

1300
01:25:30,477 --> 01:25:32,888
At least you could've given me a sign.

1301
01:25:32,888 --> 01:25:36,196
How could I have given you any signal
while the both of you were just there?

1302
01:25:36,196 --> 01:25:41,308
Here. You must have
some luck when it comes to gold.

1303
01:25:41,308 --> 01:25:42,793
And put this on me, please.

1304
01:25:42,793 --> 01:25:45,093
[He seems like he's not suspecting...]

1305
01:25:45,093 --> 01:25:48,026
[That's not the case!]

1306
01:25:48,026 --> 01:25:50,937
[Flicking attack!]

1307
01:25:50,937 --> 01:25:55,138
Ji Hyo!
I'm sorry!

1308
01:25:55,138 --> 01:25:57,845
- That doesn't work on me.
- What doesn't?

1309
01:25:57,845 --> 01:25:58,530
The flicking!

1310
01:25:58,530 --> 01:26:01,234
- It only works on dwarves.
- Really?

1311
01:26:01,291 --> 01:26:03,463
I'm here to meet my prince!

1312
01:26:03,463 --> 01:26:05,902
I thought you said flicking can
oust anyone!

1313
01:26:06,833 --> 01:26:10,166
I think we should find Ji Hyo first.

1314
01:26:10,166 --> 01:26:16,212
[He should've looked at the mirror
to know how to oust the Witch!]

1315
01:26:19,739 --> 01:26:22,650
Quite embarrassing, don't you think?

1316
01:26:23,844 --> 01:26:25,030
Come over here.

1317
01:26:25,030 --> 01:26:26,681
You really aren't anything, right?

1318
01:26:26,681 --> 01:26:28,816
I'm not anything.
My only mission was to meet you...

1319
01:26:28,816 --> 01:26:31,498
You won by yourself before
using the same tactic.

1320
01:26:31,498 --> 01:26:34,499
Do you not remember our
matching t-shirts with our names?

1321
01:26:34,499 --> 01:26:35,487
All right, I'm sorry.

1322
01:26:35,487 --> 01:26:37,969
[Blank Ji's memory attack is super effective!]

1323
01:26:38,689 --> 01:26:40,947
Just checking...

1324
01:26:40,947 --> 01:26:43,902
You must bring me to the final place.

1325
01:26:43,902 --> 01:26:47,146
[All she needs to do is
remove the Prince.]

1326
01:26:47,146 --> 01:26:49,712
<i>It'd be great if we split the gold!</i>

1327
01:26:49,712 --> 01:26:53,248
Yes, that has been my original goal!

1328
01:26:53,248 --> 01:26:56,415
I'm sorry for doubting you.

1329
01:26:56,415 --> 01:27:00,637
You thought only because it worked on
Jong Kook, it'll work on me?

1330
01:27:00,637 --> 01:27:05,106
Hey, it feels like you've been eating a
lot lately! Quite a lot!

1331
01:27:05,106 --> 01:27:07,597
It's because you're tired!

1332
01:27:07,656 --> 01:27:10,980
[Still debating whether to take off
Gary's name tag or not...]

1333
01:27:15,298 --> 01:27:16,809
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

1334
01:27:18,290 --> 01:27:20,959
[I'm sorry, Gary...]

1335
01:27:20,959 --> 01:27:24,415
[I'm a witch today, and I want my gold!]

1336
01:27:28,892 --> 01:27:31,533
[That thing on the mirror...]

1337
01:27:31,533 --> 01:27:36,976
[Is how to oust the Witch!]

1338
01:27:36,976 --> 01:27:39,927
There's something written here, Ji Hyo!

1339
01:27:43,630 --> 01:27:47,124
[Oh. My. God.]

1340
01:27:48,897 --> 01:27:52,168
[Ji Hyo the Witch completely takes over
the Seven Dwarves!]

1341
01:28:00,453 --> 01:28:03,546
- You look very annoyed.
- Doubled the annoyance today!

1342
01:28:03,546 --> 01:28:06,172
I won this crown!
I can keep this, right?

1343
01:28:06,979 --> 01:28:09,316
She completely tricked us!

1344
01:28:09,316 --> 01:28:12,084
That crow's feather that Gary is touching...

1345
01:28:12,084 --> 01:28:13,677
Ji Hyo?

1346
01:28:13,677 --> 01:28:16,940
Does it have to do with
the crows' crying when we got ousted?

1347
01:28:16,940 --> 01:28:20,385
It's the same emblem, which was
also shown during the pogo stick round.

1348
01:28:20,385 --> 01:28:22,834
It was also shown throughout
the mission.

1349
01:28:22,834 --> 01:28:27,330
I thought it was the brand of her clothes!

1350
01:28:27,330 --> 01:28:29,832
I thought it represents a designer brand!

1351
01:28:29,832 --> 01:28:34,444
So all the gold that's been found so far
is inside of that bag.

1352
01:28:34,444 --> 01:28:38,008
So Ha Ha's theory is correct.
So this is what happens to Snow White.

1353
01:28:38,008 --> 01:28:39,533
Yes, I told you!

1354
01:28:39,533 --> 01:28:41,682
[Ha Ha suggested the golddigger theory
of Snow White while in jail.]

1355
01:28:41,682 --> 01:28:46,108
So, today's winner is the Witch!

1356
01:28:47,904 --> 01:28:50,456
