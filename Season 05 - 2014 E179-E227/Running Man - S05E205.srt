[All the students at the dormitory
are in a great mood this morning.]

3
00:00:13,146 --> 00:00:15,603
We're playing like a group of old people.

4
00:00:15,604 --> 00:00:20,007
- Are you all paying your rent on time?
- Make sure to pay your bills on time.

5
00:00:20,008 --> 00:00:23,657
I'm the landlord's son, so be careful
unless you want to get evicted.

6
00:00:23,658 --> 00:00:25,948
I've been here the longest
out of everyone here.

7
00:00:26,602 --> 00:00:28,411
No, that's me.

8
00:00:28,931 --> 00:00:33,393
[How dare he say something of the like
in front of Big-nosed Brother.]

9
00:00:33,394 --> 00:00:35,623
I was born in 1993.

10
00:00:35,624 --> 00:00:38,215
- You were born in 1993?
- Of course, I was.

11
00:00:38,216 --> 00:00:42,160
- I was born in early 1993.
- Early 1993? How early?

12
00:00:42,161 --> 00:00:43,841
Very early.

13
00:00:44,123 --> 00:00:48,850
I know that you've all been students of
this dormitory for years

14
00:00:48,851 --> 00:00:51,749
- but we've got some new students.
- Please let it be girls!

15
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:55,433
- They're about to come in from over there.
- Please let it be girl students.

16
00:00:55,621 --> 00:00:57,865
It's a group of female students.

We have to get rid Kim Jong Kook first!
Get the easy ones out of the way first!

23
00:01:36,162 --> 00:01:39,231
Do you know what
her social security number is?

24
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:44,092
[Female Tiger- Baek Ji Young.
Running University's Home Econ Major.]

25
00:01:45,054 --> 00:01:47,016
[You can't find anyone who knows
how to party better than her.]

26
00:01:47,017 --> 00:01:48,864
Should we play the game over here,
and party over there?

27
00:01:48,865 --> 00:01:51,202
[Nonstop energizer bunny- Hong Jin Young.
Running University's Dancing Major.]

28

Kick with the front leg,

34
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:31,142
Hello.

35
00:02:31,405 --> 00:02:34,994
[An impressive group of
Running University students.]

36
00:02:40,447 --> 00:02:45,376
Hello, my name is Baek Ji Young of
classroom 12. It's nice to be here.

37
00:02:45,807 --> 00:02:49,680
- What's your major?
- Me? I'm a Home Economics Major.

38
00:02:51,693 --> 00:02:54,505
- I'm a Home Economics Major.
- You are?

39
00:02:54,506 --> 00:02:56,309
Shouldn't you be a
Domestic Marriage Major?

40
00:02:59,327 --> 00:03:01,918
I've never seen anyone do that
to Jong Kook.

41
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:04,312
I can't believe I just saw her
do that to Jong Kook.

42
00:03:04,313 --> 00:03:06,340
[Ji Young shows that
she isn't afraid of the Tiger.]

43
00:03:06,341 --> 00:03:09,196
Hello! Ppuing ppuing!
(Common "cute" gesture)

44
00:03:12,201 --> 00:03:15,172
- I was born in 1995. Ppuing Ppuing!
- What year?

45
00:03:15,173 --> 00:03:17,462
I was born in 1995. Ppuing Ppuing!

46
00:03:17,463 --> 00:03:19,104
[Even she can't seem to believe
her own actions.]

47
00:03:19,139 --> 00:03:21,601
She was born in the year that
I made my debut.

48
00:03:21,923 --> 00:03:26,015
Hello, my name is Lee Gook Joo,
and I'm really glad to be here.

49
00:03:26,016 --> 00:03:28,163
What's your major?

50
00:03:28,164 --> 00:03:30,376
I'm a Visual Designs Major.

51
00:03:30,937 --> 00:03:34,324
[Gook Joo must be very detail-oriented.]

52
00:03:34,325 --> 00:03:35,525
- Gook Joo.
- Yes?

53
00:03:35,526 --> 00:03:39,320
Why are you so sweaty already?
We haven't even done anything yet.

54
00:03:39,321 --> 00:03:43,220
We haven't even done anything.
We seriously have yet to do anything.

55
00:03:45,075 --> 00:03:48,005
I'm full and luxurious.

56
00:03:48,279 --> 00:03:52,207
A luxurious waistline and legs.
Full-figured and luxurious!

57
00:03:53,344 --> 00:03:56,335
[An infamous person in the dormitory.]

58
00:03:56,336 --> 00:04:01,655
- You should've put on a fake mustache.
- I wanted to look more girly on the show.

59
00:04:01,656 --> 00:04:04,081
So I left my fake mustache at home.

60
00:04:04,082 --> 00:04:07,245
Hello, I'm your favorite energizer battery,
Hong Jin Young.

61
00:04:09,715 --> 00:04:12,179
Hello everyone,
my name is Hong Jin Young.

62
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:14,639
Jin Young's putting on an act.
She's not normally like that.

63
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,799
Me?
What about me?

64
00:04:18,804 --> 00:04:21,799
- I'm sure you'll change.
- I bet she really loves to party.

65
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,367
She's the perfect type of girl
to party with.

66
00:04:24,368 --> 00:04:28,699
I bet Ji Young and Jin Young would've been
really good friends back in school.

67
00:04:32,523 --> 00:04:35,094
Don't worry about me.
I'm just trying to cool down a bit.

68
00:04:36,014 --> 00:04:39,547
I thought you were snapping off the leaves
so you could eat them like lettuce wraps.

69
00:04:39,548 --> 00:04:42,413
- Leaves for the lettuce wraps?
- No, I'm fine back here.

70
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:46,153
Hello.

71
00:04:46,154 --> 00:04:47,729
She is so pretty.

72
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:51,532
My name is Kang Seung Hyun, and
my dream is to become a famous model.

73
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,996
[Placed first in a worldwide
Asian model search.]

74
00:04:56,997 --> 00:04:59,308
- She's already a famous model.
- Can you show us your catwalk?

75
00:04:59,309 --> 00:05:02,560
- Why would you ask her to do that?
- I can't see you from that far away.

76
00:05:02,561 --> 00:05:06,041
- You can't see me? You want me to do it here?
- Yes, show us your catwalk.

77
00:05:06,042 --> 00:05:08,214
- Show us your catwalk.
- But I don't have any heels on.

78
00:05:08,215 --> 00:05:10,525
[A rare catwalk demonstration by a top model.]

79
00:05:12,172 --> 00:05:15,431
[A top model student.]

80
00:05:16,806 --> 00:05:19,146
[Luxurious Gook Joo will show off
her own style of catwalk.]

81
00:05:29,336 --> 00:05:31,482
Next, our very own Fei!

82
00:05:31,483 --> 00:05:33,108
[Miss A's very own Fei.]

83
00:05:34,276 --> 00:05:36,474
Hello everyone.

84
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:44,394
How's Ji Hyo going to follow that act?

85
00:05:44,395 --> 00:05:47,274
[Dance major exchange student, Fei.]

86
00:05:47,275 --> 00:05:49,994
- Fei has changed a lot.
- Yes, I have.

87
00:05:49,995 --> 00:05:52,756
She used to be so shy in the past,
and would never do stuff like that.

88
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:58,025
[Our Fei has changed.]

89
00:05:58,557 --> 00:06:02,730
- How did you change so much?
- It's from all the dancing I do.

90
00:06:02,731 --> 00:06:05,432
It's from all the dancing I do.

91
00:06:07,444 --> 00:06:09,170
I'm so embarrassed!

92
00:06:09,171 --> 00:06:10,669
Don't you think you're
reacting too differently?

93
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:11,905
- What did you say?
- Your reaction to her.

94
00:06:11,906 --> 00:06:17,009
It's okay because that's all she has.
That's all she has to offer unlike us.

95
00:06:17,044 --> 00:06:19,424
[You've only seen a fraction
of what she has to offer.]

96
00:06:19,933 --> 00:06:22,212
Are you looking for your lettuce
wraps again?

97
00:06:22,213 --> 00:06:24,648
[Maybe she's hungry for food?]

98
00:06:24,649 --> 00:06:26,769
- All of you are students at the moment.
- Okay.

99
00:06:27,162 --> 00:06:30,868
Your rent money that you have saved up
is slowly starting to dwindle.

100
00:06:30,869 --> 00:06:33,694
That's why you will all be participating
in summer part-time job missions.

101
00:06:34,118 --> 00:06:38,218
As a prize for winning each of the missions

102
00:06:38,219 --> 00:06:43,934
you can choose what you would need as
a struggling college student as your prize.

103
00:06:43,935 --> 00:06:46,544
Maybe we can get a washing machine.

104
00:06:47,715 --> 00:06:51,206
- I don't have a washing machine.
- The team that wins the final mission...

105
00:06:51,207 --> 00:06:55,325
will be given the chance to take
home all the prizes that have been won.

106
00:06:55,326 --> 00:06:57,374
We just have to win the final mission.

107
00:06:57,789 --> 00:07:01,548
But you can't win just at the end because
you have to collect the prizes along the way.

108
00:07:01,549 --> 00:07:04,060
- So you have to work the whole time.
- We've got two big fighters right now.

109
00:07:05,573 --> 00:07:08,192
[The formidable Tiger siblings.]

110
00:07:16,506 --> 00:07:19,418
[Off to their first part-time job location.]

111
00:07:21,358 --> 00:07:25,374
[Separate buses for the two teams.]

112
00:07:25,375 --> 00:07:27,208
- See you later, Mrs. Baek.
- See you later.

113
00:07:31,712 --> 00:07:35,218
- Gook Joo, do you have a boyfriend?
- We broke up pretty recently.

114
00:07:36,632 --> 00:07:38,971
- But why do you look so happy?
- You are such a liar!

115
00:07:39,541 --> 00:07:42,615
- You're such a liar!
- What do you think of Kwang Soo?

116
00:07:42,616 --> 00:07:45,230
- Do you think he's cute?
- I like skinny guys.

117
00:07:45,231 --> 00:07:47,657
I like chubby girls too.

118
00:07:48,676 --> 00:07:51,146
You're the first person
to ever tell me that I'm chubby.

119
00:07:51,147 --> 00:07:54,187
Why are you telling me that
I'm chubby?

120
00:07:54,188 --> 00:07:57,694
- I just meant that you're cute.
- I guarantee that you two won't ever work.

121
00:07:57,695 --> 00:08:01,085
- Why not?
- Kwang Soo isn't Gook Joo's style.

122
00:08:01,086 --> 00:08:03,387
- There's nothing wrong with me.
- I'm right, aren't I?

123
00:08:03,388 --> 00:08:05,901
You think Kwang Soo wouldn't like her?
No, it's Gook Joo who won't like him.

124
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:08,511
What are you saying is wrong
with my face?

125
00:08:08,512 --> 00:08:11,414
Gook Joo will never go for
Kwang Soo's looks.

126
00:08:12,856 --> 00:08:15,862
I think Jin Young has a really cute voice.

127
00:08:15,863 --> 00:08:17,610
But the expression on your face
says that you're lying.

128
00:08:17,611 --> 00:08:20,079
- I'm always pretty expressionless.
- Gary's just like that.

129
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,618
I really like your music.

130
00:08:22,735 --> 00:08:24,511
I just like you.

131
00:08:27,563 --> 00:08:30,389
[Just then, a bee flies in
through the bus window.]

132
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:36,376
[Jin Young very naturally jumps over
to sit down next to Gary.]

133
00:08:36,377 --> 00:08:38,184
Can I ask you what this means?

134
00:08:38,716 --> 00:08:40,967
Jin Young, 'what mean'?

135
00:08:42,099 --> 00:08:44,387
My body just felt pulled over here.

136
00:08:46,641 --> 00:08:48,968
I've never felt so at a loss
for words before.

137
00:08:51,368 --> 00:08:54,567
[While everyone is enjoying
conversing with their teammates...]

138
00:08:54,568 --> 00:08:58,355
[They arrive at their first
part-time job location.]

139
00:08:58,356 --> 00:09:00,721
- It's an amusement park.
- This is great!

140
00:09:01,103 --> 00:09:07,910
[Make your rent money mission-
First part-time job location: Amusement Park]

141
00:09:07,911 --> 00:09:11,830
You've all been told that this race is to
help you earn your rent money.

142
00:09:12,214 --> 00:09:15,409
Your first part-time job will be...

143
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:17,801
to work at an amusement park.

144
00:09:17,802 --> 00:09:20,311
[Welcome your Amusement Park Job.]

145
00:09:20,312 --> 00:09:23,283
[Everyone's in high spirits
for being at the amusement park.]

146
00:09:23,284 --> 00:09:25,268
There are a variety of jobs you can do
at an amusement park.

147
00:09:25,269 --> 00:09:29,388
That's why we've prepared
a job scramble.

148
00:09:29,389 --> 00:09:30,468
What do we have to do?

149
00:09:30,469 --> 00:09:34,129
- Do you all see the bungalow behind you?
- Yes.

150
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:37,041
- You all have to go in there.
- I bet it's really hot in there.

151
00:09:37,042 --> 00:09:38,929
- Is it air conditioned?
- No, it's not.

152
00:09:40,718 --> 00:09:45,020
[Fei really has changed a lot.]

153
00:09:45,021 --> 00:09:47,607
She never used to ask any questions,
but she's totally different now.

154
00:09:49,847 --> 00:09:54,092
I will announce through the mic what
your job will be once you're in the bungalow.

155
00:09:54,093 --> 00:10:00,038
Then only the first person to come out of
the bungalow will get to do that job.

156
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:03,323
- Only one person?
- If that person succeeds the job...

157
00:10:03,324 --> 00:10:06,529
then the team that person is on
will be given a point.

158
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:10,305
But if the person fails the job, then
a point will be given to the other team.

159
00:10:10,306 --> 00:10:12,619
[Fail the job, and the point will be
given to the opposing team.]

160
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:14,820
[It won't always be an advantage to be
the first one out of the bungalow.]

161
00:10:14,896 --> 00:10:20,446
The first team to gain a total of five points
will get to win this mission.

162
00:10:21,987 --> 00:10:23,574
It looks so hot in there.

163
00:10:23,575 --> 00:10:26,786
[Everyone steps into the bungalow.]

164
00:10:27,448 --> 00:10:30,840
- You have to use your strength, Gook Joo.
- Okay, I understand.

165
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:35,197
- Okay, to all the students...
- Yes?

166
00:10:35,198 --> 00:10:37,443
- Is everyone ready?
- Yes.

167
00:10:37,444 --> 00:10:40,583
I will now announce
what your first job is going to be.

168
00:10:41,754 --> 00:10:45,514
Your first job will be...
catching the water balloons.

169
00:10:45,515 --> 00:10:49,502
[First job- Catch the water balloons.]

170
00:10:49,503 --> 00:10:53,188
You have to throw the water balloon
into the air and spin a full circle in place.

171
00:10:53,189 --> 00:10:57,262
Then you have to catch the water balloon in
the basket placed on the top of your head.

172
00:10:57,739 --> 00:11:01,246
You have to catch at least three out of
five balloons to pass this mission.

173
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:03,991
[A total of five chances-
Must catch three to succeed.]

174
00:11:04,644 --> 00:11:06,291
[Confident Big-nose gets ready
to dash out the door.]

175
00:11:06,292 --> 00:11:10,291
[Muscle boy holds fast to the doorknob.]

176
00:11:13,359 --> 00:11:15,206
Everyone get out of the way.

177
00:11:16,682 --> 00:11:19,137
[Gook Joo is on the move.]

178
00:11:20,152 --> 00:11:22,253
[Out of my way!]

179
00:11:23,484 --> 00:11:29,758
[But... the game hasn't even started yet.]

180
00:11:30,551 --> 00:11:32,926
- We haven't started yet.
- It's a total battlefield in here.

181
00:11:34,613 --> 00:11:38,105
Everyone needs to calm down
and wait for the sound of my whistle.

182
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:42,074
- He's blocking the door.
- I never did that.

183
00:11:42,075 --> 00:11:45,169
[All the girls are engaged
in a verbal battle.]

184
00:11:47,198 --> 00:11:50,187
[Starting over until the sound of
the whistle is heard.]

185
00:12:07,832 --> 00:12:10,479
[Total chaos]

186
00:12:15,348 --> 00:12:18,059
[People wanting to get out vs
people wanting to block.]

187
00:12:25,964 --> 00:12:28,378
Fine, I'll just do it!

188
00:12:28,832 --> 00:12:33,290
[Kkuk takes an attempt at
the water balloon job.]

189
00:12:35,604 --> 00:12:38,460
[Gary is feeling bewildered after having
experienced Gook Joo's power firsthand.]

190
00:12:39,486 --> 00:12:41,702
I think he'll be able to do it.

191
00:12:43,018 --> 00:12:44,213
We have to hope that he fails.

192
00:12:44,214 --> 00:12:48,272
Whether Jong Kook succeeds or fails the job,
he will not be returning to the bungalow.

193
00:12:48,273 --> 00:12:51,586
[Once a person steps out of the bungalow,
that person can't go back in the bungalow.]

194
00:12:51,587 --> 00:12:53,328
Yes!

195
00:12:58,712 --> 00:13:01,984
[A Kkuk-less bungalow is a great
piece of news to the Red Team.]

196
00:13:05,911 --> 00:13:07,958
Let's do it over.

197
00:13:07,959 --> 00:13:10,000
[Angry Kkuk is out of control.]

198
00:13:15,259 --> 00:13:17,312
Even if Jong Kook succeeds and gets his point

199
00:13:17,313 --> 00:13:20,238
him being out of the bungalow
is worth so much more than that to us.

200
00:13:20,847 --> 00:13:22,757
Okay, let's get the game started.

201
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:26,717
Jong Kook, crouch down a bit
when you're trying to catch the balloon.

202
00:13:27,472 --> 00:13:28,876
You have to crouch down.

203
00:13:28,877 --> 00:13:32,914
Was that Fei just talking? She
never used to talk so much in the past.

204
00:13:33,568 --> 00:13:37,678
Wow, she's become quite the talker now.
I can't believe how Fei has changed.

205
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:39,942
She's learned to talk quite a bit.

206
00:13:39,943 --> 00:13:43,326
[Now that things have turned out this way,
Kkuk really needs to succeed his job at hand.]

207
00:13:43,327 --> 00:13:45,500
The sun is really bright.
Can I wear my sunglasses?

208
00:13:46,258 --> 00:13:50,474
[Worker Kkuk may get in trouble in
his attempt to look cool at the job.]

209
00:13:50,475 --> 00:13:52,410
The sun is really hot and bright out there.

210
00:13:52,411 --> 00:13:55,374
[Water balloon challenge.]

211
00:13:58,168 --> 00:14:01,870
[First attempt- Will he succeed?]

212
00:14:04,076 --> 00:14:07,832
[A total of five chances.
Fails at his first attempt.]

213
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:14,534
- Don't throw it up too high!
- Just throw it midway into the air.

214
00:14:14,535 --> 00:14:16,396
Crouch down a bit.

215
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:17,736
Okay.

216
00:14:17,737 --> 00:14:21,370
[Frightening group of female students are
nagging the ever invincible Mr. Capable.]

217
00:14:21,371 --> 00:14:23,775
Kim Jong Kook!

218
00:14:24,484 --> 00:14:27,494
[Did he catch it?]

219
00:14:27,495 --> 00:14:29,886
[No, he fails to catch it.]

220
00:14:31,515 --> 00:14:33,555
[Drops the balloon from the back.]

221
00:14:39,506 --> 00:14:43,492
[Two attempts are already wasted.
Must succeed the rest of the three chances.]

222
00:14:43,493 --> 00:14:46,320
[Ha Ha steps out to scold him as
a representative for the whole team.]

223
00:14:46,321 --> 00:14:48,157
Get back in there!

224
00:14:50,142 --> 00:14:51,745
[I can't do it.]

225
00:14:52,658 --> 00:14:54,852
Whatever!
Challenge!

226
00:15:00,098 --> 00:15:04,040
[No, not even a chance...]

227
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:07,244
[Red Team gains their first point
without even having lifted a finger.]

228
00:15:11,704 --> 00:15:14,126
How could you not have gotten
a single one?

229
00:15:17,532 --> 00:15:21,720
[Blue Team fails to gain their point,
and even loses Kkuk from their team...]

230
00:15:21,721 --> 00:15:23,642
I'm going to do it myself!

231
00:15:23,643 --> 00:15:26,058
I'm going to get rid of Gook Joo!

232
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:33,252
[MC Kkuk will carry on the show-
Time for the second round.]

233
00:15:33,253 --> 00:15:36,406
Instead of doing the Ring Around the Rosy,
I'll just play a song while you wait.

234
00:15:36,407 --> 00:15:41,597
[It's freestyle dance time
until the whistle is blown.]

235
00:15:41,598 --> 00:15:44,413
You can step out the door
once the music stops playing.

236
00:15:44,414 --> 00:15:45,987
[What's that expression on his face?]

237
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:49,148
Okay, I will announce your next job.

238
00:15:49,149 --> 00:15:51,970
[Fei succeeds her job.
Current score- 1:1.]

239
00:15:51,971 --> 00:15:54,631
Next game is, 'Stick the watermelon seed.'

240
00:15:54,632 --> 00:15:59,949
[Stick the watermelon seed.]

241
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:02,191
I'm really good at this game.

242
00:16:02,192 --> 00:16:04,451
There will be 30 seconds on the clock.

243
00:16:04,452 --> 00:16:07,572
You have to stick five watermelon seeds
on your face within those 30 seconds.

244
00:16:08,887 --> 00:16:11,049
This game may be to Gook Joo's advantage.

245
00:16:12,144 --> 00:16:15,224
[Why does Ha Ha look so anxious?]

246
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:22,592
Ha Ha just told me that he has to poop.
What are we going to do?

247
00:16:22,593 --> 00:16:25,065
I don't want to concede to him
because I really want some watermelon.

248
00:16:26,219 --> 00:16:28,337
- He just told me that he has to poop.
- Why would you tell her that?

249
00:16:28,338 --> 00:16:30,728
I just whispered to her and
asked if she could let me out.

250
00:16:30,729 --> 00:16:33,270
[He seems to have asked Gook Joo to let him
leave so that he could go to the bathroom.]

251
00:16:34,848 --> 00:16:37,343
Excuse me, can someone
get us a diaper?

252
00:16:37,344 --> 00:16:40,231
I don't know if he'll make it,
so can someone get us a diaper?

253
00:16:47,932 --> 00:16:52,540
[With the watermelon challenge on the line...
Start the music!]

254
00:16:52,541 --> 00:16:55,449
[Wait, this song is...]

255
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:58,635
['Dash' by Baek Ji Young.]

256
00:17:01,645 --> 00:17:04,554
[The original singer of this song is
excited to dance along to her own song.]

257
00:17:13,268 --> 00:17:15,343
[Make way...]

258
00:17:17,576 --> 00:17:20,411
[A halfhearted dance.]

259
00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:26,365
[In the midst of the chaos...
the whistle blows!]

260
00:17:32,032 --> 00:17:34,719
I have to get out of here!
I really have to get out of here!

261
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,763
[I have to get out of here!]

262
00:17:39,636 --> 00:17:43,448
[Haroro- A man who really needs to get out.]

263
00:17:44,668 --> 00:17:47,274
[Ji Young has made Gook Joo
her own personal mark.]

264
00:17:49,589 --> 00:17:51,599
I'm a man with a mission!

265
00:17:54,814 --> 00:18:00,189
[In the midst of all this desperate chaos...
Gook Joo makes her move.]

266
00:18:03,168 --> 00:18:08,309
[She's on the move!]

267
00:18:09,316 --> 00:18:13,883
[I will get out of here!
I will get to my watermelon!]

268
00:18:22,755 --> 00:18:26,207
[Gook Joo makes her touchdown!]

269
00:18:26,208 --> 00:18:30,707
[Gook Joo's determined focus on the watermelon
which no one could keep her away from.]

270
00:18:34,533 --> 00:18:36,787
You ultimately made it out here.

271
00:18:37,717 --> 00:18:39,843
She's freakishly strong.

272
00:18:43,463 --> 00:18:45,812
Even though she's a member
of my opposing team

273
00:18:45,813 --> 00:18:48,541
I will still judge
her performance very fairly.

274
00:18:48,542 --> 00:18:50,601
Just swallow all the seeds
along with the watermelon.

275
00:18:52,581 --> 00:18:55,801
- I'll just chomp it all down.
- Get ready!

276
00:18:58,709 --> 00:19:00,839
- Yes, I will judge it very fairly.
- How many seconds on the clock?

277
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:03,920
How many seconds?
How many seconds on the clock?

278
00:19:03,921 --> 00:19:06,343
- How many seconds? 30 seconds, right?
- Who just asked that question?

279
00:19:06,766 --> 00:19:10,262
Who's voice was that?
Who just asked that question?

280
00:19:10,263 --> 00:19:13,511
- That voice was just ear shattering.
- All my team members were one time partiers.

281
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:19,252
You know how Jin Young started off
all cute and soft spoken earlier?

282
00:19:19,253 --> 00:19:21,232
But look at her now.

283
00:19:24,074 --> 00:19:26,374
<i>Gook Joo, just swallow down
the seeds too!</i>

284
00:19:28,603 --> 00:19:31,581
Why are you crouching down so
demurely all of a sudden now?

285
00:19:33,376 --> 00:19:35,279
[There's only one person who doesn't seem to
find any of this funny at the moment.]

286
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,044
[Please make it quick.]

287
00:19:37,045 --> 00:19:39,704
I really am sorry, Ha Ha. But I
was so thirsty that I had no choice.

288
00:19:40,852 --> 00:19:44,752
[Aside from the desire to win the game,
quenching her thirst is her top priority.]

289
00:19:44,753 --> 00:19:48,464
- Gook Joo, you have to win this.
- I'm just so thirsty. Don't come any closer.

290
00:19:49,201 --> 00:19:51,358
You have to spit it out and
make it stick.

291
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:53,182
You can't spit out food.

292
00:19:53,738 --> 00:19:55,482
You'd be punished for being so wasteful.

293
00:19:55,483 --> 00:19:58,666
Slurp down all the watermelon seeds!

294
00:19:58,667 --> 00:20:01,908
I'm just going to slurp it all down!

295
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:04,906
- We shouldn't have let her out.
- Are you ready?

296
00:20:04,907 --> 00:20:07,277
The watermelon looks so good.

297
00:20:07,278 --> 00:20:09,989
Okay, get ready...

298
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:13,255
[Watermelon seed challenge- Go!]

299
00:20:17,875 --> 00:20:20,227
- Spit out the seeds.
- Just swallow it.

300
00:20:20,228 --> 00:20:22,435
Don't worry about the seeds
and just eat.

301
00:20:22,436 --> 00:20:25,189
Gook Joo, just eat.

302
00:20:30,777 --> 00:20:33,565
- She's only eating the seeds.
- She's getting all the seeds.

303
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:35,351
[Now that she's gotten her fill,
she focuses on the mission at hand.]

304
00:20:38,427 --> 00:20:39,740
I swallowed all the seeds.

305
00:20:42,376 --> 00:20:45,145
Why would you swallow the seeds?
What are you doing?

306
00:20:45,146 --> 00:20:48,935
Gook Joo is still eating.
Only ten seconds left on the clock.

307
00:20:48,936 --> 00:20:50,750
[Ten seconds left on the clock.
Must start spitting out the seeds!]

308
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:58,851
[But no seeds, and only watermelon...]

309
00:21:04,786 --> 00:21:08,918
[Time over- mission fail.]

310
00:21:10,163 --> 00:21:11,527
I have one right here.

311
00:21:11,528 --> 00:21:14,553
[No, it's all watermelon.]

312
00:21:14,554 --> 00:21:19,507
[Blue Team gains a point with
Gook Joo's failure. Blue Team 2: Red Team 1.]

313
00:21:20,115 --> 00:21:23,017
[Just then, Jin Young flies in from out of
nowhere to steal some of the watermelon.]

314
00:21:27,984 --> 00:21:29,847
[Throws her on the ground?]

315
00:21:31,709 --> 00:21:34,589
[You dare lay a hand on my watermelon?]

316
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:40,626
All the women on the show today are weird.
They're not how you're led to think they are.

317
00:21:42,448 --> 00:21:44,844
Let's just do this!
It's hot in here, so let's just do this.

318
00:21:45,861 --> 00:21:48,274
- See?
- She says it's hot in there.

319
00:21:48,275 --> 00:21:51,778
[The oldest girl of the bunch
doesn't like things to be dragged out.]

320
00:21:51,779 --> 00:21:54,162
- Seriously.
- Being hot can make you feel annoyed.

321
00:21:54,163 --> 00:21:56,460
Ji Hyo's the calmest one in there.

322
00:21:56,461 --> 00:21:59,724
- Ji Hyo's a total sweetie in there.
- She's like an angel in here.

323
00:22:00,822 --> 00:22:04,334
- Save some for us.
- Then you'd better hurry up.

324
00:22:04,335 --> 00:22:07,354
- Okay, let's all get back inside.
- Let's get this started again.

325
00:22:07,774 --> 00:22:09,936
- Let's get this going.
- I think we need to speed this along.

326
00:22:10,137 --> 00:22:11,989
Okay, here's the next job category.

327
00:22:13,084 --> 00:22:16,265
The next part-time job is...

328
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:18,873
a gourd breaker.

329
00:22:18,874 --> 00:22:21,451
- Gourd breaker?
- Breaking the gourd on your head?

330
00:22:21,452 --> 00:22:26,544
- Gourd breaker? I'm good at that game.
- Smash the gourd on your head

331
00:22:26,545 --> 00:22:29,420
and break it in one single attempt.

332
00:22:29,421 --> 00:22:32,918
[Break three gourds in a row on your head.]

333
00:22:32,919 --> 00:22:35,224
- I'll go for this one.
- Okay, you go for this one.

334
00:22:35,225 --> 00:22:38,688
[The Red Team puts their faith in Jae Suk...]

335
00:22:38,689 --> 00:22:41,878
[Blue Team will be led by Haroro
due to the current state that he's in.]

336
00:22:42,588 --> 00:22:45,420
- Get ready!
- Okay!

337
00:22:45,421 --> 00:22:47,123
Go!

338
00:22:47,124 --> 00:22:50,909
[Music starts again.]

339
00:22:52,452 --> 00:22:55,952
[Battery of love- Hong Jin Young.]

340
00:23:01,143 --> 00:23:02,880
[He really is so ugly.]

341
00:23:09,784 --> 00:23:12,133
[It's not time yet...]

342
00:23:21,298 --> 00:23:24,861
[Hands the mic over to the watermelon eater.]

343
00:23:43,715 --> 00:23:46,175
[Gook Joo gets into the music.]

344
00:24:09,444 --> 00:24:12,165
[You can't get out of here that easily!]

345
00:24:13,857 --> 00:24:16,938
[A cluster of chaos.]

346
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:29,562
[Doing everything they can to
deter their opponents from getting out.]

347
00:24:29,563 --> 00:24:31,644
[Oh?]

348
00:24:31,645 --> 00:24:34,222
[Isn't this the man with an urgent need?]

349
00:24:35,277 --> 00:24:38,451
[Eyes for the right opening...]

350
00:24:38,978 --> 00:24:42,369
[And jumps out of the melee.]

351
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:48,078
[The man with an urgent need's
desperate attempt to get out.]

352
00:24:48,079 --> 00:24:49,562
What the heck was that!

353
00:24:49,563 --> 00:24:51,877
Who was it that tried to pull
my pants down?

354
00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:55,143
[We have no idea what you're
talking about...]

355
00:24:55,144 --> 00:24:58,667
I have a reason for
needing to finish this game.

356
00:24:59,033 --> 00:25:02,802
I vow to complete this mission
so that I can take care of my own needs.

357
00:25:02,803 --> 00:25:06,658
The man with an urgent need
will make an attempt at this challenge.

358
00:25:06,659 --> 00:25:08,652
[Man with an urgent need-
Gourd breaking challenge.]

359
00:25:08,653 --> 00:25:11,018
Break all the easy ones first!

360
00:25:11,019 --> 00:25:14,288
- Okay, let's get ready.
- Whose voice is that?

361
00:25:14,289 --> 00:25:18,100
- Her voice is so weird!
- Your voice is distracting to the show.

362
00:25:19,866 --> 00:25:23,303
[A middle aged woman's voice?]

363
00:25:23,304 --> 00:25:27,566
That's not the type of voice that
a popular singer should have.

364
00:25:27,567 --> 00:25:30,286
Look at Hong Jin Young's stance.

365
00:25:30,287 --> 00:25:33,496
- What about it?
- The girls on my team are all so weird!

366
00:25:33,497 --> 00:25:38,906
- All the women on our team are a bit weird.
- Let's just do this!

367
00:25:39,588 --> 00:25:42,593
Let's just do this!

368
00:25:45,084 --> 00:25:46,366
[Please...]

369
00:25:46,367 --> 00:25:49,370
- How do you think you'll do?
- Stop talking and just get it started.

370
00:25:49,371 --> 00:25:52,307
Okay, let's just get started.

371
00:25:52,308 --> 00:25:56,462
[Ha Ha's attempt to break
three gourds in a row.]

372
00:26:00,219 --> 00:26:02,414
[With his teeth tightly gritted...]

373
00:26:15,532 --> 00:26:18,372
[Off like a bullet to take care of his needs.]

374
00:26:18,373 --> 00:26:21,885
Wow, that was just...
That was something else.

375
00:26:21,886 --> 00:26:25,382
- I don't even know what to say to that.
- Just doing this hurts my head.

376
00:26:25,383 --> 00:26:29,883
[These hard gourds have become
nothing but shards on the ground.]

377
00:26:30,716 --> 00:26:33,039
[This is the power of what
an urgent matter can do.]

378
00:26:33,771 --> 00:26:37,473
The next job category
is a very entertaining one.

379
00:26:38,043 --> 00:26:41,443
- We need to get out there.
- Your next job category is...

380
00:26:42,833 --> 00:26:45,200
It's a female arm wrestling match.

381
00:26:48,264 --> 00:26:51,499
I'm really awful at arm wrestling.

382
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:54,813
[Music is back on!]

383
00:26:54,814 --> 00:27:00,609
[This song is our very own MC Kkuk's song!]

384
00:27:00,610 --> 00:27:05,033
['How lovely' by Kim Jong Kook.]

385
00:27:10,028 --> 00:27:12,283
Why do you keep playing all
the old songs?

386
00:27:13,325 --> 00:27:15,939
[Everyone seems to be having fun!]

387
00:27:17,669 --> 00:27:19,873
[But he still sings along.]

388
00:27:32,497 --> 00:27:35,779
[This lady is getting her groove on
after her watermelon snack.]

389
00:27:41,535 --> 00:27:44,393
[Dancing queen from the 90's
is totally getting into it.]

390
00:27:45,125 --> 00:27:47,913
[Even Yoo Hyuk, the complainer,
is having a great time.]

391
00:27:49,105 --> 00:27:51,496
I don't want to stop singing the song.

392
00:27:54,789 --> 00:28:00,460
[Representative for the Red Team-
Top model, Seung Hyun.]

393
00:28:01,911 --> 00:28:04,379
[Red Team seemed confident
about this challenge...]

394
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:07,401
[But the Blue Team, on the other hand,
is forcefully dragged out of the bungalow.]

395
00:28:11,151 --> 00:28:16,429
[Jin Young attempts to go out,
and Ji Young tries to stay in.]

396
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:21,354
[In the midst of all this chaos,
down they come.]

397
00:28:27,259 --> 00:28:29,695
[What a sight...]

398
00:28:31,187 --> 00:28:34,792
[Sporting orange underwear...]

399
00:28:38,392 --> 00:28:41,000
You're about to scalp me right now.

400
00:28:41,001 --> 00:28:44,755
[What a mouth on the woman!]

401
00:28:45,205 --> 00:28:47,774
She just said,
'You're about to scalp me right now!'

402
00:28:48,886 --> 00:28:52,288
Okay, Jin Young is out.
She's our contender for the Blue Team.

403
00:28:52,289 --> 00:28:54,568
Okay, Jin Young is out.

404
00:28:55,584 --> 00:28:59,744
[Just as the Blue Team had wanted,
Jin Young makes it out as the contender.]

405
00:29:01,323 --> 00:29:02,386
[Just then...]

406
00:29:02,387 --> 00:29:04,225
I feel so much better now.

407
00:29:04,352 --> 00:29:07,109
What a great day this is!

408
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:09,988
- Are you alright?
- All's right in the world.

409
00:29:10,473 --> 00:29:14,113
- Have fun with the game.
- You did a great job earlier.

410
00:29:14,114 --> 00:29:17,092
That was nothing. You must
be getting ready to arm wrestle?

411
00:29:17,893 --> 00:29:21,222
Have you ever arm wrestled before?

412
00:29:21,223 --> 00:29:23,670
- Yes, I've arm wrestled before.
- You have?

413
00:29:23,671 --> 00:29:25,588
- She says she's good at everything.
- Really?

414
00:29:26,658 --> 00:29:29,950
- She says she really is good at it.
- Beat her, Jin Young!

415
00:29:29,951 --> 00:29:33,492
You'll be wrestling with your right hand,
and grab onto the handle with your left.

416
00:29:33,493 --> 00:29:35,532
Yes, grab onto your handle.

417
00:29:36,746 --> 00:29:39,150
Yes, there you go.
Look at how she's standing.

418
00:29:39,151 --> 00:29:40,973
Look at how Jin Young
has her legs spread open.

419
00:29:43,893 --> 00:29:46,792
- She knows what she's doing.
- She looks pretty strong.

420
00:29:46,793 --> 00:29:50,577
- She must have very strong legs.
- You look very arrogant from the back.

421
00:29:54,826 --> 00:29:56,941
Okay, here we go.
Relax your hands.

422
00:29:56,942 --> 00:29:59,888
[If Jin Young wins this game, then
the Blue Team might win the mission.]

423
00:30:00,162 --> 00:30:04,017
Ready!
Get ready...

424
00:30:04,018 --> 00:30:05,763
[Come and get me.]

425
00:30:06,114 --> 00:30:07,869
[Go easy on me, Jin Young.]

426
00:30:16,711 --> 00:30:21,469
[Very confident Jin Young...
could this be the end for her?]

427
00:30:23,712 --> 00:30:27,557
[Unbelievable!
Seung Hyun wins!]

428
00:30:39,478 --> 00:30:42,379
[A hero for the Red Team!
Seung Hyun!]

429
00:30:50,798 --> 00:30:52,523
Don't mess with me.

430
00:30:52,524 --> 00:30:54,292
[You just wait and see.]

431
00:30:54,293 --> 00:30:56,875
Not many players left.
Two members left on the Blue Team?

432
00:30:56,876 --> 00:30:59,091
What the heck?
Gary and I are the only ones left?

433
00:30:59,092 --> 00:31:01,615
- Unbelievable.
- The score is now 3:2.

434
00:31:01,616 --> 00:31:04,495
- We need to get two more points.
- Your next job category is...

435
00:31:05,213 --> 00:31:08,150
Gulp down a bottle of cola in one shot.

436
00:31:08,151 --> 00:31:10,653
[Gulp down a bottle of cola in one shot.]

437
00:31:10,654 --> 00:31:13,013
[This is Kwang Soo's specialty.]

438
00:31:13,014 --> 00:31:16,360
You must gulp down this bottle of cola in
one shot within 15 seconds.

439
00:31:16,361 --> 00:31:21,691
[Gulp it down within 15 seconds,
and abstain from burping for five seconds.]

440
00:31:21,692 --> 00:31:23,431
I can't drink any carbonated drinks.

441
00:31:23,432 --> 00:31:25,801
Ready, set, go!

442
00:31:25,802 --> 00:31:29,563
[Time for another dance session.]

443
00:31:30,811 --> 00:31:34,781
[Ji Young's 'My sweet candy.']

444
00:31:34,782 --> 00:31:36,837
Play some recent songs!

445
00:31:37,245 --> 00:31:40,473
[This old man keeps asking for some
more of the recent songs to be played.]

446
00:31:42,413 --> 00:31:45,089
[The knee kick dance.]

447
00:31:46,505 --> 00:31:49,498
[The spectators are also
getting into the groove.]

448
00:31:54,491 --> 00:31:57,609
[Ha-Gook's candy dance.]

449
00:31:57,610 --> 00:31:59,919
These guys are much more entertaining!

450
00:32:01,247 --> 00:32:03,897
[Ha-Gook couple is the spotlight of the show.]

451
00:32:10,613 --> 00:32:14,109
[Even the original singer of the song
is impressed by their performance.]

452
00:32:14,930 --> 00:32:16,639
We can't let them show us up like that.

453
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,333
[Upset at having their spotlight
stolen from them.]

454
00:32:18,334 --> 00:32:21,022
[Like this?]

455
00:32:23,351 --> 00:32:27,303
[Ha-Gook candy.]

456
00:32:28,671 --> 00:32:31,781
[Just then...]

457
00:32:34,083 --> 00:32:35,628
What are you doing, Ji Young?

458
00:32:36,187 --> 00:32:39,324
[Kwang Soo attempts to leave
to take on the cola challenge.]

459
00:32:39,325 --> 00:32:41,892
[But he's stopped by Ji Young's
forceful defensive move.]

460
00:32:43,148 --> 00:32:45,197
Why are you doing this?

461
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:52,526
[Gary uses this chance to
push Jae Suk out the door.]

462
00:33:11,668 --> 00:33:14,783
[In the midst of all this chaos,
Jae Suk is shoved out the door.]

463
00:33:14,784 --> 00:33:17,792
[Flame-broiled Grasshopper.]

464
00:33:17,793 --> 00:33:20,442
Welcome, welcome.

465
00:33:20,443 --> 00:33:23,392
- Why didn't you make it out there?
- You were supposed to do this one!

466
00:33:23,393 --> 00:33:26,302
- We're glad to have you out here, Jae Suk.
- It could've been really big trouble.

467
00:33:28,377 --> 00:33:31,537
[Ji Young looks beyond excited from
having screwed Kwang Soo over.]

468
00:33:31,538 --> 00:33:34,789
That's why I told you to get
Ji Young out the door earlier.

469
00:33:34,790 --> 00:33:38,196
[No matter what the case, it's now
up to Jae Suk to take on the task.]

470
00:33:38,197 --> 00:33:40,975
The most important thing to note
is that the cola is very warm right now.

471
00:33:41,821 --> 00:33:45,941
[Cola is now very warm
from having been out in the sun.]

472
00:33:45,942 --> 00:33:48,097
- This needs to be cold.
- Yes, that's how it should be.

473
00:33:49,757 --> 00:33:53,452
- I bet that will taste very sweet.
- Here's a cold bottle right here.

474
00:33:53,453 --> 00:33:58,107
[Cold 500 ml bottle vs warm 350 ml bottle-
The choice is up to Jae Suk to make.]

475
00:33:58,108 --> 00:34:01,435
Go for the cold bottle.

476
00:34:08,957 --> 00:34:14,080
[Tempted by the devil- The feel
of the ice cold bottle on his neck.]

477
00:34:14,081 --> 00:34:17,222
- Cold one will sting more.
- Your body's needs don't matter.

478
00:34:19,141 --> 00:34:22,888
[But the undeniable draw of
the ice cold bottle.]

479
00:34:22,889 --> 00:34:27,147
- Go for the cold one!
- This cola is like a femme fatale.

480
00:34:27,572 --> 00:34:31,512
[Deadly bottle of femme fatale.]

481
00:34:32,650 --> 00:34:34,956
- Go for the cold one!
- 350ml!

482
00:34:34,957 --> 00:34:38,601
Go for the cold one!
Cold drinks are better in the heat!

483
00:34:41,569 --> 00:34:43,914
[Will it be the cold bottle of 500ml,
or the warm bottle of 350ml?]

484
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:46,894
[That is the real question.]

485
00:34:46,895 --> 00:34:48,744
Okay, I'll go with the cold bottle!

486
00:34:51,926 --> 00:34:54,614
- Cola needs to be cold.
- Yes, that's right!

487
00:34:54,615 --> 00:34:56,721
[Femme fatale tempts Jae Suk into
falling for its devilish draw.]

488
00:34:57,301 --> 00:35:01,638
[Ends up choosing a bottle that's
150ml more in volume.]

489
00:35:02,677 --> 00:35:05,043
Start the countdown from opening
the bottle.

490
00:35:05,044 --> 00:35:09,278
- What's wrong with that lady?
- Just get this lady out of here.

491
00:35:09,982 --> 00:35:12,982
No, that's a very good point.

492
00:35:12,983 --> 00:35:15,536
[The ever entertaining voice show.]

493
00:35:15,537 --> 00:35:17,364
Are you ready?

494
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:19,520
You only have 15 seconds,
and you can't stop at all.

495
00:35:19,521 --> 00:35:21,992
You can't spill any either,
and should drink before it gets warm.

496
00:35:21,993 --> 00:35:26,450
[Wait five seconds after downing
the whole bottle within 15 seconds.]

497
00:35:36,314 --> 00:35:39,853
[Makes your own throat burn in pain
just from looking at what he's doing.]

498
00:35:43,944 --> 00:35:45,786
He's almost done with it.

499
00:35:48,590 --> 00:35:51,668
[The amount of cola
is very clearly diminishing.]

500
00:35:56,191 --> 00:35:57,988
[He succeeds in finishing
the bottle within 15 seconds.]

501
00:35:57,989 --> 00:36:01,822
[Now must hold off from burping
for five full seconds.]

502
00:36:13,218 --> 00:36:16,724
[A satisfying burping ceremony.]

503
00:36:22,045 --> 00:36:24,405
You definitely know how to eat!

504
00:36:27,785 --> 00:36:30,488
You succeeded with the time
of 14.78 seconds.

505
00:36:30,884 --> 00:36:35,975
[With Jae Suk's success,
the score is now tied at 3:3.]

506
00:36:37,989 --> 00:36:41,536
[Only two more points left to score
by either one of the teams.]

507
00:36:41,537 --> 00:36:42,697
We will play the last game for two points.

508
00:36:42,698 --> 00:36:47,565
For the Read Team, we still have
Ji Suk Jin, Blank Ji Hyo and Kwang Soo.

509
00:36:47,566 --> 00:36:49,719
For the Blue Team,
we still have Gary and Ji Young left.

510
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:54,153
Since this last game is worth two points,
we'll have a special competition mission.

511
00:36:54,154 --> 00:36:57,435
It's a competition mission,
which means only one player per team.

512
00:36:57,799 --> 00:36:59,707
For the mission...

513
00:36:59,708 --> 00:37:02,067
Split the apple in half with your
bare hands.

514
00:37:02,068 --> 00:37:04,647
- Ji Young!
- Ji Young!

515
00:37:04,648 --> 00:37:08,621
As you may have already guessed,
both players will do it on the count of three.

516
00:37:08,622 --> 00:37:12,220
The first person who can break it
in half will win the game.

517
00:37:12,221 --> 00:37:14,698
You need to have skills for this,
and Gary will be good at it.

518
00:37:14,699 --> 00:37:18,752
- I don't know who can do it on our team.
- Ji Hyo will probably be the best bet.

519
00:37:18,753 --> 00:37:20,589
[These two men are less trustworthy
than Blank Ji.]

520
00:37:20,590 --> 00:37:23,388
Okay, here comes the music.
Play the music!

521
00:37:23,389 --> 00:37:26,696
[Cue the final song!]

522
00:37:26,697 --> 00:37:30,674
[Sad Salsa- Baek Ji Young.]

523
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:35,148
[Hair pulling same aged friends.]

524
00:37:37,834 --> 00:37:41,049
[Fancy footwork!]

525
00:37:43,278 --> 00:37:45,901
Gook Joo has nice footwork.

526
00:37:45,902 --> 00:37:47,970
I lost 8kg by dancing.

527
00:37:52,403 --> 00:37:54,939
[Fei's engine gets started.]

528
00:38:00,636 --> 00:38:03,912
[Dancing mania, Yoo Hyuk, gets
the honor of being her dance partner.]

529
00:38:09,134 --> 00:38:12,240
Just hold still, Jae Suk!

530
00:38:26,847 --> 00:38:29,114
[Shakes in unison.]

531
00:38:35,372 --> 00:38:38,626
Why don't you all come out for
a little dance break?

532
00:38:40,248 --> 00:38:43,674
[Games all having been forgotten,
the day turns into a sudden dance party.]

533
00:38:43,675 --> 00:38:47,206
[Amusement Park Dance Club opens.]

534
00:38:57,703 --> 00:39:00,482
[Hot dance time.]

535
00:39:03,677 --> 00:39:06,950
[The original dancing queen
takes over the dance floor.]

536
00:39:13,299 --> 00:39:15,607
[Heavy head banging dance.]

537
00:39:18,624 --> 00:39:21,132
[Next dancer...]

538
00:39:30,429 --> 00:39:34,039
[Unexpected dance skills!]

539
00:39:36,705 --> 00:39:39,632
[Dance king, Mr. Gary,
is now a fan of Gook Joo's dancing.]

540
00:39:41,035 --> 00:39:44,846
[Top model Seung Hyun's turn.]

541
00:39:51,294 --> 00:39:53,955
[This is also totally unexpected.]

542
00:39:53,956 --> 00:39:58,040
Let's dance with our friend, Se Young.

543
00:39:58,041 --> 00:40:00,510
[Seung Hyun's long time best friend,
Se Young PD is invited to join their dance.]

544
00:40:00,511 --> 00:40:03,528
Are you just going to sit there as
your friend is humiliating herself out there?

545
00:40:03,563 --> 00:40:06,655
DJ Yoo Hyuk is in the groove
and pulls other onto the dance floor.

546
00:40:10,110 --> 00:40:12,421
[The PD doesn't even have her shoes on.]

547
00:40:14,712 --> 00:40:16,963
[Okay, whatever!]

548
00:40:20,110 --> 00:40:22,537
It's a party!

549
00:40:29,163 --> 00:40:31,679
[Party chaos!]

550
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:35,227
- What about the game?
- Let's just do the game!

551
00:40:50,918 --> 00:40:52,500
You guys are all so weird!

552
00:40:52,501 --> 00:40:54,414
Call the police!

553
00:40:58,260 --> 00:41:00,174
Okay, that's enough.

554
00:41:00,175 --> 00:41:02,296
I finished wiping down the table.

555
00:41:02,297 --> 00:41:05,154
Come on, let's play the game.

556
00:41:05,155 --> 00:41:07,224
Want to switch?

557
00:41:07,225 --> 00:41:09,267
- Switch what?
- Switch the music and dance again.

558
00:41:09,268 --> 00:41:12,534
Please, that's enough!

559
00:41:12,535 --> 00:41:15,942
One more time?
Don't you want to dance some more?

560
00:41:15,943 --> 00:41:18,878
Ever since that impromptu dance party,
Gary won't leave me alone now.

561
00:41:18,879 --> 00:41:22,160
- Look at him.
- I didn't know it would be like this either.

562
00:41:22,917 --> 00:41:25,812
- Are you the new Monday Couple?
- Maybe he really is attracted to her.

563
00:41:25,813 --> 00:41:29,413
- This is no joke.
- But Ji Young looks really annoyed.

564
00:41:29,414 --> 00:41:31,857
She looks annoyed because
she wants to party some more.

565
00:41:31,858 --> 00:41:35,483
- She does look annoyed.
- Should we go home with all these girls?

566
00:41:36,969 --> 00:41:39,861
[Gook Joo is trying to gauge
Ji Young's mood.]

567
00:41:40,787 --> 00:41:42,920
Just let me know whenever
you're ready to go.

568
00:41:42,921 --> 00:41:45,276
You girls just stay still.
Ji Young says that she's tired.

569
00:41:45,958 --> 00:41:50,867
- And what's this guy's deal?
- Gary is still sitting next to her.

570
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:55,745
[I like you.]

571
00:41:59,626 --> 00:42:02,237
One final two point game, right?

572
00:42:02,943 --> 00:42:07,468
[One last final showdown with
two points for the win on the line.]

573
00:42:07,469 --> 00:42:10,037
- Man against man.
- Ji Suk Jin and Gary!

574
00:42:10,038 --> 00:42:13,982
[Split the apple open in half with bare hands-
Red Team's Red Nose vs Blue Team's Gary.]

575
00:42:14,620 --> 00:42:16,326
- Ready!
- Let me wipe my hands first.

576
00:42:16,327 --> 00:42:18,277
[The game with the winner
of the first game on the line.]

577
00:42:19,791 --> 00:42:22,527
Fighting, Gary!

578
00:42:22,528 --> 00:42:27,371
- Fighting, Suk Jin!
- Fighting!

579
00:42:29,156 --> 00:42:32,026
[Which team has the better cheerleaders?
Time to start the game!]

580
00:42:32,854 --> 00:42:36,779
[Just who will win the game?]

581
00:42:37,193 --> 00:42:42,526
[Oh my goodness!
Completely unexpected!]

582
00:42:42,527 --> 00:42:46,886
[Big-nose wins the game!]

583
00:42:50,142 --> 00:42:56,722
[Celebratory dance time.]

584
00:42:59,382 --> 00:43:02,972
[Apple love shot.]

585
00:43:09,319 --> 00:43:14,178
[Final score- 3:5.
Red Team wins!]

586
00:43:14,179 --> 00:43:16,496
It's time for your prize.

587
00:43:16,497 --> 00:43:19,691
There are seven cake boxes in front of you.

588
00:43:19,692 --> 00:43:24,466
Five of the most popular items of what
all college students wants are in the boxes

589
00:43:24,467 --> 00:43:28,831
- but two boxes are duds.
- Good! That's so great.

590
00:43:28,832 --> 00:43:33,618
The winner team will come forward and
choose five out of the seven boxes.

591
00:43:33,619 --> 00:43:39,426
The loser team will get to choose
one of the two leftover boxes.

592
00:43:39,427 --> 00:43:44,101
[Blue Team only gets to choose
one of the two leftovers.]

593
00:43:45,324 --> 00:43:49,690
[Red Team's carefully makes their selection.]

594
00:43:49,691 --> 00:43:51,446
You can't change your mind
once you choose.

595
00:43:51,447 --> 00:43:54,333
Okay, Kwang Soo will start.
One, two, three.

596
00:43:54,334 --> 00:43:59,315
[First selection- A bike.
Good selection.]

597
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:03,517
[A real bike awaits for the winner
in the final location.]

598
00:44:04,894 --> 00:44:09,135
[Second box- Digital camera.]

599
00:44:11,275 --> 00:44:13,579
- Are they really getting that?
- These are real nice cameras.

600
00:44:14,131 --> 00:44:16,386
Okay, Blank Ji.
On the count of three.

601
00:44:16,387 --> 00:44:19,800
[Third box- A dud.]

602
00:44:19,801 --> 00:44:21,854
[One of the two duds are chosen.]

603
00:44:21,855 --> 00:44:23,867
Gook Joo, on the count of three.

604
00:44:23,868 --> 00:44:28,951
[Fourth box- A pair of headphones.]

605
00:44:32,568 --> 00:44:34,024
Okay, Seung Hyun is up next.

606
00:44:34,025 --> 00:44:36,651
[Last box- A box of ramen.]

607
00:44:36,652 --> 00:44:39,957
[Wait, that's...]

608
00:44:42,312 --> 00:44:45,811
[Gook Joo can't believe what
she's seeing.]

609
00:44:48,390 --> 00:44:50,629
- Let's swap places.
- She likes the ramen better.

610
00:44:52,143 --> 00:44:54,625
[Headphones and ramen.
Swaps out her spot with Seung Hyun.]

611
00:44:58,401 --> 00:45:00,378
- No, you pick.
- Have Ji Young pick.

612
00:45:00,379 --> 00:45:02,138
[Blue Team's turn to pick.]

613
00:45:05,327 --> 00:45:09,026
One is a dud, and I'll
tell you what the other prize is.

614
00:45:09,027 --> 00:45:11,385
- What is it?
- It's a laptop computer.

615
00:45:11,386 --> 00:45:14,529
[One is a dud, and the other is a laptop.]

616
00:45:14,530 --> 00:45:18,787
[Two completely different outcomes.]

617
00:45:18,788 --> 00:45:21,778
It's okay, Ji Young.
Fighting!

618
00:45:21,779 --> 00:45:24,607
[Ji Young seems to have had
made up her mind.]

619
00:45:24,608 --> 00:45:27,494
- Oh my God.
- Come on, Mrs. Baek.

620
00:45:34,405 --> 00:45:38,898
[Blue Teams wins the laptop
with their one and only chance.]

621
00:45:41,206 --> 00:45:44,177
The Blue Team won the laptop computer

622
00:45:44,178 --> 00:45:50,659
and the Red Team won the bicycle, digital camera,
headphones and the box of ramen.

623
00:45:50,660 --> 00:45:53,005
We still took the biggest prize
even after having lost the game.

624
00:45:53,006 --> 00:45:55,697
- Gook Joo, ramen or the laptop?
- Ramen!

625
00:45:57,388 --> 00:45:59,663
Slurp down all the ramen!

626
00:45:59,664 --> 00:46:01,319
- Is everyone hungry?
- Yes!

627
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:04,280
- We'll move onto our next location.
- Okay, let's go!

628
00:46:04,281 --> 00:46:06,955
[Off to their next job location
to help satisfy their hunger.]

629
00:46:06,956 --> 00:46:09,833
<i>I can have my ramen even
without kimchi.</i>

630
00:46:09,834 --> 00:46:11,465
You know that song?

631
00:46:12,541 --> 00:46:15,095
I thought that Seung Hyun
would be the better dancer

632
00:46:15,096 --> 00:46:18,384
but it was Gook Joo who was
the better and sexier dancer.

633
00:46:18,385 --> 00:46:23,115
I thought Seung Hyun would be a sexy dancer,
but she was a horrible dancer instead.

634
00:46:23,116 --> 00:46:26,482
It's been about 28 years since I've seen
a woman dance the crab dance like she did.

635
00:46:27,199 --> 00:46:29,923
Gook Joo was a really great dancer.

636
00:46:29,924 --> 00:46:34,369
I used to be a better dancer, but
became clumsy as I gained more weight.

637
00:46:34,370 --> 00:46:35,841
I used to be so swift on my feet.

638
00:46:35,842 --> 00:46:39,249
I realized it once again today,
but Ji Hyo really isn't all that tough.

639
00:46:39,250 --> 00:46:42,693
[Ji Hyo isn't all that tough- Showing
off a much gentler side to her today.]

640
00:46:42,694 --> 00:46:45,316
- I'm a very sweet person, Jae Suk.
- I was so shocked, Ji Hyo.

641
00:46:45,317 --> 00:46:48,599
- Jin Young and Ji Young though...
- They're both something else.

642
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:51,870
[Jin Young and Ji Young...
Frightening Young Sisters.]

643
00:46:53,035 --> 00:46:54,930
[What about me?]

644
00:46:55,779 --> 00:46:58,624
- What are you craving the most?
- Me?

645
00:46:58,625 --> 00:47:00,788
I want a really cold bowl of noodles.

646
00:47:01,971 --> 00:47:04,312
Bean noodles.

647
00:47:04,313 --> 00:47:08,941
- I like it sweet with some sugar in it.
- You can't do that! You need salt!

648
00:47:08,942 --> 00:47:12,165
- We use sugar in Jeollado.
- No, you need to be using salt.

649
00:47:12,166 --> 00:47:15,664
[Is it salt or the sugar?]

650
00:47:15,665 --> 00:47:19,024
Sugar is so good in it.
My blood sugar level is really low.

651
00:47:21,568 --> 00:47:25,842
[Students arrive at their next job location.]

652
00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:28,698
I bet the ribs here are really amazing.
Let's work hard so we get to eat it too.

653
00:47:30,302 --> 00:47:34,307
[What kind of a job will they be doing
at this rib restaurant?]

654
00:47:37,023 --> 00:47:42,829
Your next job has been especially prepared for
all of you whom I know are hot and hungry.

655
00:47:42,830 --> 00:47:45,023
It's everyone's beloved rib restaurant.

656
00:47:46,936 --> 00:47:50,258
- Part-time meat job.
- I'll show you how much I can slurp it down.

657
00:47:50,259 --> 00:47:52,061
[One of their job locations-
A barbeque restaurant!]

658
00:47:53,467 --> 00:47:57,330
Only one representative from
each team will play the game.

659
00:47:57,331 --> 00:48:00,513
Do you see the five metal pots
on the tables in front of you?

660
00:48:00,514 --> 00:48:04,343
The two players will take turns
lifting up the lids from the pots.

661
00:48:04,344 --> 00:48:09,623
But if you choose a bad pot lid
where only the handle is lifted up

662
00:48:09,624 --> 00:48:13,942
then a member of that team will get soaked
by the water dumper staged in the back.

663
00:48:13,943 --> 00:48:15,214
And that person will be ousted.

664
00:48:15,215 --> 00:48:18,046
Then the person who made the bad choice
will be swapped out for a new player.

665
00:48:18,047 --> 00:48:23,000
[Can choose the order of the player themselves
and keep playing until a member is ousted.]

666
00:48:23,001 --> 00:48:24,577
I think Ji Young has the magic touch today.

667
00:48:24,578 --> 00:48:27,008
[Ji Young with the lucky touch of the laptop
is chosen to represent her team.]

668
00:48:27,009 --> 00:48:30,120
Sine Ji Young is stepping up,
our Miss Blank will represent our team.

669
00:48:30,121 --> 00:48:33,515
- She's so lucky with things like this.
- Ji Hyo's always good at things like this.

670
00:48:33,516 --> 00:48:36,085
[Round one- Baek Ji Young vs Song Ji Hyo.]

671
00:48:36,086 --> 00:48:39,339
- But I picked a dud earlier.
- No, that was just a fluke.

672
00:48:39,340 --> 00:48:42,149
- You can do this. Fighting.
- We now have to pick the other person?

673
00:48:42,150 --> 00:48:44,353
We're going to pick Suk Jin to go first.

674
00:48:45,067 --> 00:48:49,458
[Chooses Suk Jin to stand under
the water dumper without even a hesitation.]

675
00:48:51,794 --> 00:48:53,977
- Why don't you go stand back there?
- Okay.

676
00:48:56,114 --> 00:49:00,087
[Water dumper-
Hong Jin Young vs Ji Suk Jin.]

677
00:49:00,922 --> 00:49:03,687
[If their teammate selects
the defective pot lid...]

678
00:49:03,688 --> 00:49:06,286
[Then it's an immediate cold shower.]

679
00:49:06,287 --> 00:49:09,377
You can decide amongst yourselves
as to who's going to go first.

680
00:49:09,378 --> 00:49:11,057
Rock, paper, scissors!

681
00:49:11,666 --> 00:49:14,851
[Ji Hyo wins-
Ji Hyo gets to make the first selection.]

682
00:49:14,852 --> 00:49:17,468
- Fighting!
- Our newest sweet and gentle girl!

683
00:49:18,945 --> 00:49:21,383
- You're an angel!
- You're a sweet and gentle girl!

684
00:49:21,384 --> 00:49:22,792
Challenge!

685
00:49:22,793 --> 00:49:25,734
[One of the five lids is a defective one.]

686
00:49:28,682 --> 00:49:32,034
[Success- A perfect lid.]

687
00:49:33,278 --> 00:49:35,274
- It's okay.
- You're going to get soaked!

688
00:49:35,275 --> 00:49:37,772
It's okay, don't worry.
You can do it.

689
00:49:37,773 --> 00:49:40,147
[Baek Ji Young's turn.]

690
00:49:41,605 --> 00:49:43,873
- Challenge!
- She's got the feel for it.

691
00:49:44,876 --> 00:49:47,572
[Success- Ji Young also selects
a perfectly fine lid.]

692
00:49:52,023 --> 00:49:56,601
[Now the risks are even higher!]

693
00:49:58,815 --> 00:50:01,213
[Ji Hyo succeeds.]

694
00:50:03,087 --> 00:50:06,555
[Blank Ji definitely is one lucky lady.]

695
00:50:09,115 --> 00:50:11,608
You can do it, Ji Young.

696
00:50:12,770 --> 00:50:15,969
- It's a fifty percent chance!
- I know you can do it!

697
00:50:18,142 --> 00:50:22,825
[One of the two is defective...
and one of the two will get soaked.]

698
00:50:22,826 --> 00:50:25,835
Ji Young will make her selection first,
and Ji Hyo will get the other one.

699
00:50:25,836 --> 00:50:28,175
You can't touch it yet.

700
00:50:28,793 --> 00:50:32,099
Okay, lift it up on the count of three.
One of you two will definitely get soaked.

701
00:50:32,100 --> 00:50:34,374
One...

702
00:50:34,375 --> 00:50:35,706
One.

703
00:50:36,336 --> 00:50:37,702
Two!

704
00:50:37,703 --> 00:50:44,233
[Who will the lady of luck smile down upon?]

705
00:50:59,929 --> 00:51:02,646
[Ji Young ends up with the defective lid.]

706
00:51:09,378 --> 00:51:12,867
[A deluge of water dumps down on Jin Young.]

707
00:51:15,208 --> 00:51:18,835
[What just happened?]

708
00:51:21,041 --> 00:51:24,000
[A soaked dance time.]

709
00:51:27,186 --> 00:51:29,338
[Blank Ji Hyo,
with the lady of luck on her side.]

710
00:51:29,339 --> 00:51:31,112
No, it's okay.

711
00:51:31,113 --> 00:51:34,730
[Jin Young is now soaked to the bone without
even having tasted any of the tasty rib meat.]

712
00:51:34,731 --> 00:51:37,320
- Okay, Jong kook will go next.
- It's Jong Kook's turn next.

713
00:51:37,321 --> 00:51:40,364
[Jong Kook of the Blue Team will now
go stand under the water dumper.]

714
00:51:40,365 --> 00:51:44,460
Since I went first earlier,
I'll let the other team go first this time.

715
00:51:44,461 --> 00:51:46,686
Don't be like that and just go for it!

716
00:51:48,606 --> 00:51:49,942
Challenge.

717
00:51:50,756 --> 00:51:54,259
[Lady of luck... please smile down upon me.]

718
00:51:57,361 --> 00:51:59,722
[Huh?]

719
00:52:00,779 --> 00:52:03,088
[Seriously?]

720
00:52:04,188 --> 00:52:07,348
[Baek Ji Young selects the defective lid.]

721
00:52:19,112 --> 00:52:22,927
[Ji Young, new icon of misfortune.]

722
00:52:23,828 --> 00:52:26,818
[Lucky lady, Blank Ji, wins twice in a row.]

723
00:52:28,742 --> 00:52:31,218
I told you that I have rotten luck!

724
00:52:32,893 --> 00:52:35,041
Ji Young is the best.

725
00:52:35,554 --> 00:52:40,352
[The icon of misfortune is drawn to
all the defective lids on the table.]

726
00:52:40,353 --> 00:52:42,592
Okay, Kang Gary will go up next.

727
00:52:42,593 --> 00:52:44,364
[Gary is sent in to take the next shower.]

728
00:52:44,365 --> 00:52:46,527
I'll just be prepared to get soaked.

729
00:52:51,005 --> 00:52:54,438
Gary is already preparing his heart
for the deluge of cold water.

730
00:52:58,644 --> 00:53:06,207
Even though he says he's tough,
he's a major pampered city boy.

731
00:53:06,208 --> 00:53:09,736
Okay, let's go!

732
00:53:09,737 --> 00:53:12,211
- Do it first.
- Okay, I'll go first.

733
00:53:12,212 --> 00:53:13,876
[Blank Ji makes the first selection.]

734
00:53:15,631 --> 00:53:17,972
- Just pick the one you like.
- This one!

735
00:53:20,130 --> 00:53:23,006
<i>Let's go home nice and dry.</i>

736
00:53:23,007 --> 00:53:25,848
- She really is amazing.
- Okay, I know which one.

737
00:53:26,656 --> 00:53:29,458
[One of the four is defective.]

738
00:53:29,459 --> 00:53:30,918
I feel so nervous!

739
00:53:32,967 --> 00:53:35,141
[Ji Young also succeeds.]

740
00:53:36,234 --> 00:53:37,804
She got it?

741
00:53:40,107 --> 00:53:42,842
You're going to win.
You're too lucky to lose.

742
00:53:44,232 --> 00:53:45,586
Challenge.

743
00:53:51,187 --> 00:53:55,114
[Ji Hyo gives Big-nose a shower
by picking the defective lid.]

744
00:53:57,081 --> 00:53:59,567
[Prepares himself for the deluge of water.]

745
00:54:02,368 --> 00:54:07,942
[What? Where's the water?]

746
00:54:07,943 --> 00:54:10,076
- I can't stand to watch anymore.
- Just put him out of his misery.

747
00:54:11,946 --> 00:54:15,929
We have a slight malfunction,
so go stand under the other dumper.

748
00:54:15,930 --> 00:54:19,062
[Moves over to the other dumper
to receive his water shower.]

749
00:54:20,365 --> 00:54:21,885
Please.

750
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:26,765
What is this?

751
00:54:34,714 --> 00:54:37,894
[It's just a regular shower for Big-nose.]

752
00:54:39,617 --> 00:54:40,943
What is this?

753
00:54:43,076 --> 00:54:47,228
[Unlucky Big-nose employee...]

754
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:52,580
What the heck is this!

755
00:54:52,581 --> 00:54:55,130
Why are you giving him a shower?

756
00:54:55,898 --> 00:55:00,069
[Even a machine malfunction
is a cause for laughter.]

757
00:55:01,003 --> 00:55:04,241
Okay, we'll switch.
I'll swap Kwang Soo out.

758
00:55:04,242 --> 00:55:08,847
[Kwang Soo is swapped out for Ji Hyo.]

759
00:55:09,700 --> 00:55:13,058
[Under the water dumper-
Ha Ha vs Kang Seung Hyun.]

760
00:55:13,059 --> 00:55:15,068
Kwang Soo and I are awful
at things like this.

761
00:55:15,069 --> 00:55:17,626
The Red Team is already looking deflated.

762
00:55:17,627 --> 00:55:21,102
Now that he's in that seat, it's all over now.

763
00:55:21,103 --> 00:55:23,085
Rock, paper, scissors.

764
00:55:23,604 --> 00:55:26,268
[Off to a good start!]

765
00:55:26,269 --> 00:55:28,262
Challenge!

766
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:31,228
- Fighting.
- Her voice is already different.

767
00:55:31,229 --> 00:55:32,725
[Oh my goodness!]

768
00:55:34,530 --> 00:55:36,966
[Definitely the new icon of misfortune.]

769
00:55:39,332 --> 00:55:42,353
[Goodbye, Ha Ha.]

770
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:46,881
[A frightening level of misfortune.]

771
00:55:46,882 --> 00:55:49,634
[Even this unlucky man admits
to her misfortune.]

772
00:55:51,395 --> 00:55:55,378
[The little kiddo explodes.]

773
00:55:58,536 --> 00:56:02,290
[Then I'll go stand under the dumper...]

774
00:56:03,930 --> 00:56:06,031
I don't think I can trust Kwang Soo.

775
00:56:07,303 --> 00:56:09,305
- It's okay.
- I'll be fine.

776
00:56:09,306 --> 00:56:10,608
Show us a wave if you get soaked.

777
00:56:10,609 --> 00:56:16,500
Do you know the scene in that movie when
Ye Jin throws her head back as she gets wet?

778
00:56:17,024 --> 00:56:19,536
[Sohn Ye Jin in Art of Seduction.]

779
00:56:20,898 --> 00:56:23,782
[The sexy water shower scene.]

780
00:56:24,198 --> 00:56:26,807
She truly is a goddess.

781
00:56:26,808 --> 00:56:28,130
[This?]

782
00:56:29,178 --> 00:56:33,287
[Toss of the hair and
extending out the leg is key.]

783
00:56:37,279 --> 00:56:39,664
[Fails to imitate Sohn Ye Jin.]

784
00:56:39,665 --> 00:56:42,601
Rock, paper, scissors.

785
00:56:42,602 --> 00:56:44,961
Yes!
I'll go second!

786
00:56:46,353 --> 00:56:50,682
- That's a very good plan, Kwang Soo.
- You've got luck on your side, Kwang Soo.

787
00:56:50,683 --> 00:56:52,776
That's a very good plan.

788
00:56:55,912 --> 00:56:58,991
[Selects a normal lid.]

789
00:56:58,992 --> 00:57:02,086
- She's better than me.
- Don't even think about it, Kwang Soo.

790
00:57:07,527 --> 00:57:10,350
[25% chance of choosing the defective lid.]

791
00:57:12,374 --> 00:57:15,138
[Kwang Soo miraculously succeeds.]

792
00:57:21,538 --> 00:57:23,561
It's okay.
Relax and just pick one.

793
00:57:24,206 --> 00:57:27,678
- You'll be fine.
- They all look the same.

794
00:57:29,791 --> 00:57:31,765
[An uneasy feeling...]

795
00:57:36,930 --> 00:57:39,603
[Lucky Fei!]

796
00:57:41,298 --> 00:57:44,056
[I'm so going to pick the defective one...]

797
00:57:44,083 --> 00:57:48,234
Once he makes the selection,
you will both have to lift up the lid.

798
00:57:53,401 --> 00:57:56,372
[Nervous Gook Joo can't do
anything else but laugh.]

799
00:57:56,373 --> 00:57:58,410
- I'll go with this one.
- Okay.

800
00:57:59,890 --> 00:58:02,940
Okay, you both have to lift it up
on the count of three.

801
00:58:02,941 --> 00:58:05,170
[Lift it up simultaneously.]

802
00:58:06,546 --> 00:58:08,352
One.

803
00:58:08,353 --> 00:58:12,163
[Which of the two will end up getting soaked?]

804
00:58:12,763 --> 00:58:14,733
I won't let you down, Gook Joo!

805
00:58:19,047 --> 00:58:23,161
[Lady of luck, please smile down upon me...]

806
00:58:25,165 --> 00:58:27,505
[Kwang Soo has the luck on his side!]

807
00:58:27,859 --> 00:58:30,479
[The defective lid!]

808
00:58:31,099 --> 00:58:33,649
[Ji Young immediately falls into
Sohn Ye Jin's pose.]

809
00:58:38,694 --> 00:58:42,887
[A sexy new goddess at the rib restaurant.]

810
00:58:46,277 --> 00:58:48,021
[Seaweed hair.]

811
00:58:51,761 --> 00:58:55,074
[The ever still sexy Mrs. Baek.]

812
00:58:57,866 --> 00:59:00,821
- Only one person left on the Blue Team.
- Yes.

813
00:59:00,822 --> 00:59:02,805
Okay, here we go.

814
00:59:02,806 --> 00:59:04,367
Choose the order by playing
rock, paper, scissors.

815
00:59:05,101 --> 00:59:07,173
Rock, paper, scissors.

816
00:59:07,174 --> 00:59:09,368
I'll go second.

817
00:59:09,646 --> 00:59:12,845
That's a good plan, Kwang Soo.

818
00:59:14,489 --> 00:59:17,089
[Jin Young goes first.]

819
00:59:17,090 --> 00:59:19,181
Just pick whichever one you want.

820
00:59:19,621 --> 00:59:21,673
[Feeling the energy from each of the lids.]

821
00:59:24,399 --> 00:59:26,970
[Hong Ji Young succeeds.]

822
00:59:26,971 --> 00:59:29,777
- You have to be confident when you do it.
- You look pretty with the reflected light.

823
00:59:29,778 --> 00:59:31,977
[Like this?]

824
00:59:31,978 --> 00:59:35,929
- Do you like her or something?
- She is my ideal type.

825
00:59:37,435 --> 00:59:39,818
- Who is? Jin Young?
- Yes, I like her style.

826
00:59:39,819 --> 00:59:41,920
Wait, then we're going to
have to do this.

827
00:59:44,547 --> 00:59:48,515
[MC Love-Line makes a quick appearance.]

828
00:59:49,355 --> 00:59:52,208
- So this is what you've been waiting for?
- No, Jae Suk.

829
00:59:52,881 --> 00:59:55,762
Seriously, you should've told me sooner.

830
00:59:56,093 --> 00:59:58,556
We're going to do this seriously.

831
00:59:58,557 --> 01:00:01,536
- Kwang Soo likes cute girls like Jin Young.
- Yes, he really does.

832
01:00:01,537 --> 01:00:04,887
- I know that much about Kwang Soo.
- I'm so weak at things like this.

833
01:00:04,888 --> 01:00:08,852
We won't end here, but you can exchange
your numbers right here and right now.

834
01:00:08,853 --> 01:00:12,613
[Agreement to exchange
personal phone numbers.]

835
01:00:12,614 --> 01:00:17,069
Let's not waste any time here.

836
01:00:17,070 --> 01:00:21,143
- This isn't just for fun right now.
- We have to get your mothers to meet.

837
01:00:22,045 --> 01:00:25,869
Look at how it's done.
Gary and Ji Young will give a demonstration.

838
01:00:25,870 --> 01:00:29,250
[Look at each other if there's mutual liking,
or look away if there isn't.]

839
01:00:29,251 --> 01:00:31,702
Three.
This is how you do it.

840
01:00:32,207 --> 01:00:35,431
[If you don't like the other person,
then completely disregard the person.]

841
01:00:35,432 --> 01:00:37,906
This is how you do it.

842
01:00:37,907 --> 01:00:40,340
- May I ask how old you are?
- We're the same age.

843
01:00:40,341 --> 01:00:42,250
[Both born in '85.]

844
01:00:42,251 --> 01:00:45,477
One, two...

845
01:00:45,478 --> 01:00:46,765
Three.

846
01:00:49,157 --> 01:00:51,005
[Disregards her?]

847
01:00:51,006 --> 01:00:52,999
Fine, let's just be friends.

848
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:56,300
Fine, let's just be friends.
You totally made me feel bad!

849
01:01:02,945 --> 01:01:05,756
I would normally let this go,
but can't let it go this time.

850
01:01:05,757 --> 01:01:09,792
[But how can they let this one go
when she just got dissed by Giraffe?]

851
01:01:09,793 --> 01:01:13,555
No, that wasn't what I meant.
I just meant that we could be friends.

852
01:01:13,556 --> 01:01:16,257
- Hey!
- Stop hanging all over me.

853
01:01:17,292 --> 01:01:19,847
She's the obsessive type,
and I'd get sick of that.

854
01:01:20,098 --> 01:01:23,029
I have never seen anyone
get dumped by Kwang Soo before.

855
01:01:23,030 --> 01:01:26,032
- Come on, Jin Young.
- I'm so embarrassed right now.

856
01:01:28,816 --> 01:01:32,979
Did you hear what she said earlier?
She says, 'Fine, let's just be friends!'

857
01:01:33,867 --> 01:01:36,699
[Haroro is having too much fun
teasing her while she's down.]

858
01:01:38,337 --> 01:01:39,785
Ready.

859
01:01:43,287 --> 01:01:47,267
- You'll get punished for this.
- No, I won't. Challenge!

860
01:01:47,268 --> 01:01:51,365
[Will Giraffe pick
the defective one this time?]

861
01:01:51,366 --> 01:01:52,725
Yes, go for that one.

862
01:01:54,625 --> 01:01:58,516
[If they win this round,
then the Red Team wins the game.]

863
01:01:58,517 --> 01:02:00,166
Just go with the one you feel
good about.

864
01:02:05,493 --> 01:02:09,108
[There's his punishment.]

865
01:02:19,465 --> 01:02:21,847
[That was a lot of water.]

866
01:02:26,546 --> 01:02:30,121
[A very forceful impact.]

867
01:02:31,622 --> 01:02:35,129
What was that? Why did
you have to dump so much water?

868
01:02:35,130 --> 01:02:38,643
[It was the same amount of water,
but a different effect on Gook Joo.]

869
01:02:38,644 --> 01:02:42,569
- I'm sorry, Gook Joo.
- The force totally knocked your head back.

870
01:02:44,224 --> 01:02:46,219
Gook Joo, are you okay?

871
01:02:46,220 --> 01:02:48,646
[Interviews the victim of the water splash.]

872
01:02:48,647 --> 01:02:50,965
- You think that was funny?
- Look at her face!

873
01:02:50,966 --> 01:02:54,170
Is it funny to totally make
a joke out of a woman like this?

874
01:02:54,790 --> 01:02:56,971
I bet this restaurant is making
a lot of money from all this.

875
01:02:56,972 --> 01:02:58,868
How much water did you just
dump on her?

876
01:03:03,814 --> 01:03:06,192
I like a lot of water.

877
01:03:06,193 --> 01:03:10,989
[Still able to maintain her humor
even after all that.]

878
01:03:10,990 --> 01:03:12,876
Wow, that was amazing.

879
01:03:16,116 --> 01:03:17,915
No, that was fun.
I enjoyed that.

880
01:03:17,916 --> 01:03:20,499
- Get her another towel.
- I hope you all enjoyed that.

881
01:03:25,822 --> 01:03:28,784
[People still left remaining are-
Blue Team 1 vs Red Team 2.]

882
01:03:28,785 --> 01:03:31,421
- We're all friends here.
- This could be the final round.

883
01:03:31,422 --> 01:03:32,731
Rock, paper, scissors.

884
01:03:33,468 --> 01:03:36,416
Rock, paper, scissors.
I'll go second.

885
01:03:36,417 --> 01:03:38,858
[Giraffe still sticks to his original plan.]

886
01:03:38,859 --> 01:03:42,392
- You'll be fine with Ji Hyo up there.
- Ji Hyo will give you her lucky energy.

887
01:03:44,325 --> 01:03:45,686
Challenge.

888
01:03:46,760 --> 01:03:48,810
[Easily succeeds her turn.]

889
01:03:49,578 --> 01:03:51,900
[A celebratory ceremony.]

890
01:03:53,756 --> 01:03:55,034
Let's go, Kwang Soo.

891
01:03:56,263 --> 01:03:58,770
[Giraffe also picks a normal lid.]

892
01:03:59,293 --> 01:04:01,031
It's all because of Ji Hyo's luck.

893
01:04:01,032 --> 01:04:03,031
Okay, just pick one.

894
01:04:05,855 --> 01:04:09,199
[Success!
Another lid dance.]

895
01:04:10,331 --> 01:04:12,307
Okay, it's Kwang Soo's turn to choose.

896
01:04:12,308 --> 01:04:16,439
[Only two lids to choose from.
It's a fifty-fifty chance.]

897
01:04:18,408 --> 01:04:24,322
[A fifty-fifty chance of winning.
Will the Red Team win the game?]

898
01:04:25,146 --> 01:04:29,404
[Last chance for this one unlucky man!]

899
01:04:31,822 --> 01:04:34,483
[Kwang Soo's unbelievable turn!
Red Team wins!]

900
01:04:49,270 --> 01:04:53,450
- Ji Hyo seriously has all the luck.
- This wasn't your luck, but it was Ji Hyo's.

901
01:04:53,451 --> 01:04:56,084
- This was all Ji Hyo's luck.
- Seriously, Ji Hyo...

902
01:04:56,919 --> 01:05:00,637
Red Teams wins the restaurant
mission as well.

903
01:05:00,638 --> 01:05:03,320
[Red Team wins again
at the restaurant mission.]

904
01:05:03,321 --> 01:05:07,225
Your prize for winning this game...

905
01:05:07,226 --> 01:05:11,314
is the prize of a backpack trip that
all college students dream of.

906
01:05:11,315 --> 01:05:13,817
[All college students' fantasy-
a backpack trip.]

907
01:05:13,818 --> 01:05:20,266
[A total of two duds. Choose four of the six,
and the Blue Team will choose one of two.]

908
01:05:20,267 --> 01:05:22,321
- What's in it?
- A car rental coupon!

909
01:05:22,322 --> 01:05:25,241
[Seung Hyun chooses the rental car coupon.]

910
01:05:29,510 --> 01:05:34,032
[Big-nose's selection is... a dud!]

911
01:05:34,033 --> 01:05:36,707
We never told Suk Jin
that he could choose one.

912
01:05:41,061 --> 01:05:44,272
Come on, Rambo!
Make your selection.

913
01:05:44,587 --> 01:05:47,381
[Lucky shot for her prize.]

914
01:05:48,819 --> 01:05:52,406
[Another dud!]

915
01:05:54,243 --> 01:05:55,911
Plane tickets!

916
01:05:55,912 --> 01:05:58,409
[The ever lucky Blank Ji!
This is just plain amazing!]

917
01:05:58,410 --> 01:06:00,731
This is amazing.
Her luck is just unbelievable.

918
01:06:02,895 --> 01:06:06,387
- We can't even get the zipper to work.
- Hope it's not anything good.

919
01:06:10,143 --> 01:06:12,263
- A meal ticket.
- Ugh, I want that!

920
01:06:12,264 --> 01:06:14,495
[Genuinely seems disappointed.]

921
01:06:14,496 --> 01:06:18,388
- Want to swap it for the plane ticket?
- No, we'll swap Ji Suk Jin for it.

922
01:06:19,935 --> 01:06:21,344
No, thank you.

923
01:06:23,569 --> 01:06:30,011
[Prizes won so far...]

924
01:06:31,111 --> 01:06:34,225
[Off to the next location on the same bus.]

925
01:06:34,647 --> 01:06:38,471
- But why are we taking the same bus?
- I like taking the same bus.

926
01:06:38,472 --> 01:06:40,362
- Why?
- Why do you like it?

927
01:06:40,363 --> 01:06:44,445
- Is it because of Kwang Soo?
- Come on, don't be like that.

928
01:06:44,446 --> 01:06:46,602
[Could it be because of this one man?]

929
01:06:47,283 --> 01:06:49,974
- Let's just clear this up right now.
- Tell them, Kwang Soo.

930
01:06:49,975 --> 01:06:52,489
Your husband at SBS is Kwang Soo.

931
01:06:53,985 --> 01:06:58,344
- But she really is my ideal personal type.
- You don't have to lie about that.

932
01:06:58,345 --> 01:07:00,749
- Who wouldn't like Jin Young?
- Yes, that's very true.

933
01:07:00,750 --> 01:07:04,799
Okay, then let's just play
the dating roulette.

934
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:08,441
- Okay, just go for it then.
- I'll even put Ji Young in there.

935
01:07:08,442 --> 01:07:11,173
[Lee Kwang Soo's ideal type
dating roulette.]

936
01:07:11,817 --> 01:07:13,780
- You have to say whatever comes to mind.
- Okay.

937
01:07:13,781 --> 01:07:15,662
This is where we're going to determine it.

938
01:07:15,663 --> 01:07:21,080
Song Ji Hyo and Baek Ji Young.
One, two, three.

939
01:07:21,081 --> 01:07:23,093
- Baek Ji Young!
- Yes!

940
01:07:24,986 --> 01:07:27,320
[Blank Ji is eliminated right off the bat.]

941
01:07:28,091 --> 01:07:29,182
Saw that?

942
01:07:29,183 --> 01:07:32,509
Even though Ji Hyo has absolutely
no interest in Kwang Soo

943
01:07:32,510 --> 01:07:34,446
but I bet she's still feeling a little
disappointed by his selection.

944
01:07:34,447 --> 01:07:37,238
Congratulations to Baek Ji Young,
and let's go on with the game.

945
01:07:37,239 --> 01:07:39,380
Baek Ji Young is moved up on the list.

946
01:07:39,381 --> 01:07:41,632
Okay, onto the next pairing.

947
01:07:42,415 --> 01:07:44,035
We'll go with Fei.

948
01:07:44,748 --> 01:07:46,952
- Don't be surprised, Fei. Okay?
- Okay.

949
01:07:46,953 --> 01:07:52,060
[Miss A's resident entertainer, Fei vs
Worldwide top model, Kang Seung Hyun.]

950
01:07:52,061 --> 01:07:54,066
Wait, wait!
I need a moment.

951
01:07:55,546 --> 01:07:57,298
It's Fei against Seung Hyun.
One, two, three!

952
01:07:57,299 --> 01:07:58,942
Seung Hyun!

953
01:08:01,122 --> 01:08:04,507
- Why would you drop Fei?
- Don't ask him why.

954
01:08:04,508 --> 01:08:07,570
- There's no reason to discuss his reasons.
- Why do you look so disappointed?

955
01:08:08,983 --> 01:08:11,764
As you can plainly see,
these two women in this row over here...

956
01:08:11,765 --> 01:08:13,252
You need to watch out for these two.

957
01:08:13,253 --> 01:08:18,686
Okay, we'll go with Ms. Hong this time.
Jin Young vs Gook Joo.

958
01:08:18,687 --> 01:08:21,453
Is it Gook Joo or Jin Young.
One, two, three!

959
01:08:21,454 --> 01:08:23,687
- Is it Gook Joo or Jin Young?
- Gook Joo!

960
01:08:23,688 --> 01:08:25,534
Gook Joo!

961
01:08:26,824 --> 01:08:28,384
You get over here right now.

962
01:08:30,585 --> 01:08:32,610
Do something with him!

963
01:08:32,611 --> 01:08:35,168
He says he'll get sick of you,
so just sit back down in your seat.

964
01:08:36,343 --> 01:08:39,588
- I didn't take you to be like this.
- No, you need to sit back down.

965
01:08:39,589 --> 01:08:42,139
I'm really disappointed in you.

966
01:08:42,140 --> 01:08:45,204
Jin Young is a bit of an obsessive type.

967
01:08:47,970 --> 01:08:50,860
So I've beat an actress,
a singer, and a model?

968
01:08:51,498 --> 01:08:53,845
You've already moved onto the semi-finals.

969
01:08:53,846 --> 01:08:57,096
- You've moved up to the semi-finals.
- I don't think I'm going to lose.

970
01:09:00,195 --> 01:09:03,088
It's Baek Ji Young vs Seung Hyun.

971
01:09:03,729 --> 01:09:06,668
Ji Young or Seung Hyun?
One, two, three!

972
01:09:06,669 --> 01:09:08,043
Seung Hyun!

973
01:09:11,100 --> 01:09:12,495
[Mrs. Baek's one final word.]

974
01:09:12,496 --> 01:09:14,441
You can just have him.

975
01:09:14,442 --> 01:09:17,121
[Seung Hyun moves onto the final round.]

976
01:09:17,122 --> 01:09:20,029
Let me remind everyone of who didn't
make the cut.

977
01:09:20,030 --> 01:09:23,849
That would be Jin Young, Fei, Blank Ji Hyo
and even Ji Young now.

978
01:09:24,898 --> 01:09:27,941
- What are you basing your decisions on?
- Don't ask him questions like that.

979
01:09:27,942 --> 01:09:31,359
The only thing Kwang Soo is basing his
decisions on is that it isn't Jin Young.

980
01:09:31,360 --> 01:09:34,032
How can you even say that?

981
01:09:34,033 --> 01:09:37,105
- No, he didn't mean that. Sit down.
- Kwang Soo normally isn't so blunt about it.

982
01:09:37,106 --> 01:09:40,290
It's now Seung Hyun vs Gook Joo.

983
01:09:40,291 --> 01:09:42,699
Will it be Gook Joo or Seung Hyun?

984
01:09:43,016 --> 01:09:45,493
[Final round of ideal type roulette.]

985
01:09:45,494 --> 01:09:49,220
- One, two, three!
- Seung Hyun!

986
01:09:49,467 --> 01:09:52,738
[Seung Hyun wins the roulette!]

987
01:09:56,807 --> 01:09:59,269
- You were just using Gook Joo.
- No, I wasn't.

988
01:09:59,270 --> 01:10:03,494
- How did I use her?
- You are an awful jerk!

989
01:10:08,905 --> 01:10:10,627
I didn't use her.

990
01:10:11,186 --> 01:10:13,739
[Sadly disappointed by his selection.]

991
01:10:16,287 --> 01:10:18,703
- Swap seats with Gary.
- Why?

992
01:10:18,704 --> 01:10:20,787
[Jin Young tries to seat Seung Hyun
next to Kwang Soo.]

993
01:10:20,788 --> 01:10:23,621
That's not something for you
to worry about.

994
01:10:23,622 --> 01:10:26,307
Don't worry about what Kwang Soo does.

995
01:10:26,308 --> 01:10:28,503
Why are you girls fighting over me?

996
01:10:39,722 --> 01:10:43,691
[Arrives at the next job location.]

997
01:10:48,777 --> 01:10:50,189
What is this place?

998
01:10:50,190 --> 01:10:54,201
[What kind of work awaits them here?]

999
01:10:54,202 --> 01:10:57,130
This is an old school part-time job.

1000
01:10:57,131 --> 01:10:59,185
Newspaper delivery.

1001
01:10:59,186 --> 01:11:02,225
Like I told you earlier,
this is a newspaper delivery center.

1002
01:11:02,226 --> 01:11:07,029
You'll be playing newspaper basketball
with these bundles of newspaper.

1003
01:11:08,579 --> 01:11:11,201
[Basketball nets are brought out.]

1004
01:11:11,202 --> 01:11:13,082
- Wow, that's awesome.
- They're real basketball nets.

1005
01:11:13,083 --> 01:11:16,399
- They really bounce.
- Balls made out of newspapers.

1006
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:19,121
This will be a bit different than
your regular basketball games.

1007
01:11:19,122 --> 01:11:21,051
I told you that this is
a mercy basketball game, right?

1008
01:11:21,052 --> 01:11:23,007
[Everything goes!]

1009
01:11:23,008 --> 01:11:26,220
You can lift up your teammates for the goal,
and basically anything goes in this game.

1010
01:11:26,653 --> 01:11:31,252
- Two points for dunk shots.
- We have Kwang Soo on our team.

1011
01:11:31,253 --> 01:11:33,495
[Kwang Soo's height will be to his advantage.]

1012
01:11:37,196 --> 01:11:40,048
[An easy dunk shot.]

1013
01:11:40,695 --> 01:11:44,600
- Since dunk shots are worth two points...
- We've got Kwang Soo and Seung Hyun.

1014
01:11:44,601 --> 01:11:47,683
We can lift her up together
and let her dunk it.

1015
01:11:47,684 --> 01:11:50,275
There's no need to do all that, Suk Jin.

1016
01:11:50,276 --> 01:11:53,322
With Kwang Soo on outside,
we're guaranteed to score some goals.

1017
01:11:53,323 --> 01:11:55,489
[Kwang Soo and Seung Hyun-
Their own goliath.]

1018
01:11:56,014 --> 01:11:58,576
[Plan is to have Kwang Soo lift Seung Hyun
on his shoulders for dunk shots.]

1019
01:12:00,120 --> 01:12:03,795
[Meanwhile, the men on the Blue Team
do some light warmup moves.]

1020
01:12:07,180 --> 01:12:10,916
[Every ball that they throw
makes it into the goal.]

1021
01:12:12,112 --> 01:12:14,707
[Those guys are no joke...]

1022
01:12:20,374 --> 01:12:21,525
Ready!

1023
01:12:21,980 --> 01:12:27,620
[Mercy newspaper basketball- Start.]

1024
01:12:28,220 --> 01:12:31,998
[A giant goliath is born
at the sound of the whistle.]

1025
01:12:32,594 --> 01:12:35,604
[How are we going to stop those giants?]

1026
01:12:36,456 --> 01:12:40,234
[Playing defense so that the goliath
can't get their hands on the ball.]

1027
01:12:41,612 --> 01:12:44,351
[Catches the ball!]

1028
01:12:49,514 --> 01:12:51,392
There you go.
Just keep going.

1029
01:12:52,696 --> 01:12:54,774
Get in there!

1030
01:12:56,125 --> 01:12:59,123
[The ball just floats midair
like a full moon.]

1031
01:13:09,672 --> 01:13:13,514
[Gook Joo bulldozer clears the path
for the Goliath.]

1032
01:13:16,386 --> 01:13:19,200
[Makes it to the goal net.]

1033
01:13:21,104 --> 01:13:23,762
[A successful dunk!]

1034
01:13:30,856 --> 01:13:33,654
[The Blue Team makes an offense move.]

1035
01:13:34,382 --> 01:13:37,182
[Kkuk makes a slam dunk.]

1036
01:13:41,641 --> 01:13:44,628
[Even though they might have the height,
Goliath is lacking in speed.]

1037
01:13:44,629 --> 01:13:47,421
[Speed isn't on their side.]

1038
01:13:48,104 --> 01:13:50,694
Go to the middle, Kwang Soo.

1039
01:13:53,397 --> 01:13:54,934
You don't have to dribble the ball.

1040
01:13:56,947 --> 01:13:58,197
Pass it to Gook Joo.

1041
01:13:58,198 --> 01:13:59,860
Pass the ball to Gook Joo.

1042
01:13:59,861 --> 01:14:01,870
[Nice pass, Kwang Soo!]

1043
01:14:08,347 --> 01:14:11,204
[Nice shot!
Makes the goal on a rebound.]

1044
01:14:11,205 --> 01:14:13,725
[Giraffe is pulling his weight
as the center player.]

1045
01:14:14,327 --> 01:14:17,499
You have to block their offense moves.

1046
01:14:17,500 --> 01:14:21,067
That's right.
Suk Jin can move off to the side.

1047
01:14:24,625 --> 01:14:26,893
[Tiny Haroro vs Giant Giraffe.]

1048
01:14:27,935 --> 01:14:32,447
[Evades his block... and misses the goal.]

1049
01:14:34,925 --> 01:14:36,859
[Kkuk misses the ball.]

1050
01:14:38,641 --> 01:14:41,369
You missed the ball!

1051
01:14:42,282 --> 01:14:44,483
[Embarrassed]

1052
01:14:48,179 --> 01:14:50,267
[Whenever something bad
happens to Kwang Soo...]

1053
01:14:50,268 --> 01:14:52,744
[Gook Joo runs over to his rescue.]

1054
01:14:56,687 --> 01:14:58,795
[Forceful removal.]

1055
01:14:59,587 --> 01:15:01,781
Run, Ji Hyo!

1056
01:15:04,295 --> 01:15:09,989
[Anyone who gets in Ace Ji Hyo's way...
Gook Joo will punish.]

1057
01:15:10,527 --> 01:15:15,333
[Gook Joo clears the path...
and Blank Ji scores the goal.]

1058
01:15:17,620 --> 01:15:20,457
[Blank Ji and Gook Joo-
A fantastic combo play.]

1059
01:15:20,458 --> 01:15:24,559
Stay right there, Gook Joo.

1060
01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:26,679
Don't move.

1061
01:15:28,428 --> 01:15:30,913
[Gook Joo's energy starts to deplete-
Must conserve her energy.]

1062
01:15:30,914 --> 01:15:32,821
- Get in there, Seung Hyun.
- Seriously!

1063
01:15:43,664 --> 01:15:46,335
Why is the net so low?
You can't have the net hanging so low.

1064
01:15:46,336 --> 01:15:47,908
Nice steal!

1065
01:15:47,909 --> 01:15:49,353
[Bravo, Giraffe!]

1066
01:15:49,354 --> 01:15:51,614
Give it to Jin Young.

1067
01:15:53,365 --> 01:15:55,529
[Midair blocking.]

1068
01:15:55,530 --> 01:15:57,593
Ugh, he's so annoying!

1069
01:15:59,703 --> 01:16:02,629
[Fairy Fei is brought in
to save the Blue Team.]

1070
01:16:02,630 --> 01:16:04,136
Gook Joo!

1071
01:16:11,438 --> 01:16:12,801
Run!

1072
01:16:13,515 --> 01:16:14,985
Out of my way!

1073
01:16:14,986 --> 01:16:16,965
Pass the ball to Kwang Soo!

1074
01:16:19,505 --> 01:16:21,668
- Please stop!
- Steal the ball!

1075
01:16:22,480 --> 01:16:24,415
This isn't basketball!

1076
01:16:26,201 --> 01:16:29,381
[What do you mean, how is this basketball?
It's mercy basketball.]

1077
01:16:34,471 --> 01:16:38,497
[Kkuk-Joo personally blocks Kkuk.]

1078
01:16:39,838 --> 01:16:41,800
How is this even basketball?

1079
01:16:41,801 --> 01:16:44,386
- Gook Joo won't even let me play!
- Gook Joo!

1080
01:16:44,387 --> 01:16:46,614
[The terror on the basketball court-
Kkuk Joo.]

1081
01:16:48,217 --> 01:16:53,287
[A pro stealer... and an amateur shooter.]

1082
01:16:55,811 --> 01:16:58,077
[Blue Team on the offense.]

1083
01:17:00,751 --> 01:17:03,221
[There's the long arm block again!]

1084
01:17:03,749 --> 01:17:06,003
[Nice defense!]

1085
01:17:07,142 --> 01:17:09,431
[Red Team is on the offense this time.]

1086
01:17:10,594 --> 01:17:13,751
[Gary's defensive move
might have ulterior motives.]

1087
01:17:13,752 --> 01:17:15,175
Seung Hyun!

1088
01:17:27,290 --> 01:17:28,863
What is this!

1089
01:17:32,067 --> 01:17:37,221
[Smacked down by Gook Joo...
and undressed by Fei.]

1090
01:17:40,355 --> 01:17:43,288
[Ha Ha takes advantage of his chance
and makes the goal with ease.]

1091
01:17:43,289 --> 01:17:45,673
Nice!
The score is now tied!

1092
01:17:47,882 --> 01:17:50,234
[The end of the first half.]

1093
01:17:50,235 --> 01:17:51,996
What the heck is this!

1094
01:17:53,043 --> 01:17:56,148
- Kwang Soo, are you okay?
- This is a total battlefield.

1095
01:17:56,149 --> 01:17:58,278
It's a complete battlefield.

1096
01:17:58,279 --> 01:18:00,910
- How is this even basketball?
- This is too much!

1097
01:18:02,018 --> 01:18:04,630
[Rest time on the bench.]

1098
01:18:06,709 --> 01:18:09,388
- That was a good game though.
- It's so hot out there.

1099
01:18:09,389 --> 01:18:13,330
They're so much faster than us.

1100
01:18:13,331 --> 01:18:15,455
Kwang Soo, are you okay?

1101
01:18:15,456 --> 01:18:17,622
- Are you okay?
- No, I'm not okay!

1102
01:18:18,129 --> 01:18:21,484
I didn't undress you on purpose.

1103
01:18:21,852 --> 01:18:24,882
- Who took your shirt off?
- Why are you doing this to me, Fei?

1104
01:18:26,278 --> 01:18:28,028
It's seriously so hot.

1105
01:18:28,029 --> 01:18:30,978
- It's unbelievably hot.
- What kind of a move was that earlier?

1106
01:18:30,979 --> 01:18:33,306
You can't make moves like that.

1107
01:18:33,307 --> 01:18:36,596
[They're all arguing with each other
on the dirty methods used during the game.]

1108
01:18:36,597 --> 01:18:38,782
You guys did a lot to us too!

1109
01:18:40,153 --> 01:18:42,460
Don't get discouraged when they score on us
and just start running to the other side.

1110
01:18:42,461 --> 01:18:46,621
[Game plan for the second half
is to keep running offensive plays.]

1111
01:18:46,622 --> 01:18:49,540
The girls can grab the ball and
stand in front of the goal.

1112
01:18:49,541 --> 01:18:51,888
Can you please take me out of the game?

1113
01:18:51,889 --> 01:18:56,009
- No, you're our most valuable player.
- Please, I don't think I can take it anymore.

1114
01:18:56,010 --> 01:18:57,754
[Game or not,
I need to survive the day first.]

1115
01:18:57,755 --> 01:18:59,622
Okay, let's get out there.

1116
01:19:00,142 --> 01:19:05,889
I don't think the ladies on our team will be
able to get any rest today.

1117
01:19:06,454 --> 01:19:08,822
You just have to keep running.
We have no other choice right now.

1118
01:19:11,453 --> 01:19:13,280
We will now start the second half.

1119
01:19:13,281 --> 01:19:15,059
Current score is tied at 4:4.

1120
01:19:15,220 --> 01:19:17,603
[Second half- Start.]

1121
01:19:17,604 --> 01:19:20,256
- Block her!
- Let's do this!

1122
01:19:21,272 --> 01:19:24,956
[A very rough start to the second half.]

1123
01:19:35,456 --> 01:19:39,390
[Ha Ha Iverson-
Scores a point with his impressive skills.]

1124
01:19:42,525 --> 01:19:44,373
- Dong Hoon!
- You're such a good basketball player.

1125
01:19:44,771 --> 01:19:48,251
[Sisters Blank Ji, Gook Joo, and Seung Hyun
advance with the ball hidden behind them.]

1126
01:19:48,252 --> 01:19:50,019
Where's the ball?

1127
01:19:50,020 --> 01:19:51,552
[Kkuk Joo takes charge of blocking Kkuk.]

1128
01:19:51,553 --> 01:19:53,960
[And Seung Hyun uses her chance
to score a point for their team.]

1129
01:19:59,666 --> 01:20:02,398
[Blue Teams' offense.]

1130
01:20:06,251 --> 01:20:09,732
[The moment the ball is grabbed,
then the person with the ball is attacked.]

1131
01:20:11,346 --> 01:20:14,457
[Sisters Blank Ji, Seung Hyun and Gook Joo
are on the offense again.]

1132
01:20:14,458 --> 01:20:16,076
Move, Jong Kook!

1133
01:20:19,941 --> 01:20:21,740
Gook Joo's making me so hot!

1134
01:20:22,340 --> 01:20:24,461
Gook Joo's making me so hot!

1135
01:20:27,237 --> 01:20:29,086
Go and score the goal.

1136
01:20:31,522 --> 01:20:33,926
[You are my destiny!]

1137
01:20:35,658 --> 01:20:38,142
[Score!]

1138
01:20:38,992 --> 01:20:40,447
You guys are doing great!

1139
01:20:41,565 --> 01:20:44,420
[Four points already!
Seung Hyun is a goal scoring machine!]

1140
01:20:44,832 --> 01:20:46,872
We have to save our Dong Hoon!

1141
01:20:46,873 --> 01:20:49,610
[Red Team has their Seung Hyun,
but the Blue Team has their Dong Hoon.]

1142
01:20:49,611 --> 01:20:51,023
Run!

1143
01:20:55,682 --> 01:20:58,050
[Give me the ball!]

1144
01:20:58,051 --> 01:21:00,846
- You have to stop her!
- No!

1145
01:21:03,416 --> 01:21:05,372
Do you want to die!

1146
01:21:07,272 --> 01:21:10,949
[These two are having a full out brawl
on the basketball court.]

1147
01:21:20,299 --> 01:21:26,032
[Two overly passionate and
fiery female students.]

1148
01:21:29,348 --> 01:21:32,256
Let's swap Gook Joo out for a minute.

1149
01:21:32,257 --> 01:21:34,024
Gook Joo needs to get some rest.

1150
01:21:34,025 --> 01:21:36,844
- Go get some rest, Gook Joo.
- Do you need to rest too, Jin Young?

1151
01:21:36,845 --> 01:21:41,695
[The two fiery players are
benched for some rest time.]

1152
01:21:41,696 --> 01:21:43,388
I think you may need to stop by
at the salon.

1153
01:21:43,389 --> 01:21:45,780
No, I'm fine.

1154
01:21:45,781 --> 01:21:47,978
- This is fun.
- Gook Joo.

1155
01:21:47,979 --> 01:21:49,532
This is fun.

1156
01:21:49,533 --> 01:21:51,810
[Even after all the tussle and fighting,
they're best friends in the end.]

1157
01:21:51,811 --> 01:21:54,368
Kang Gary keeps getting in my way!

1158
01:21:56,413 --> 01:21:57,988
Kwang Soo!

1159
01:21:57,989 --> 01:22:02,964
I love you, Lee Kwang Soo!

1160
01:22:08,114 --> 01:22:10,382
Boo, Kim Jong Kook!

1161
01:22:12,346 --> 01:22:14,318
Boo, Ha Ha!

1162
01:22:15,556 --> 01:22:19,846
[Screams out to whomever gets the ball.]

1163
01:22:22,122 --> 01:22:24,576
[The ball is back in Seung Hyun's hands.]

1164
01:22:25,928 --> 01:22:28,116
[Nice shot!]

1165
01:22:30,534 --> 01:22:34,460
[Five points scored in the game!
The reigned queen of mercy basketball!]

1166
01:22:40,586 --> 01:22:43,473
[While everyone's still focused on Seung Hyun,
Kkuk uses this chance to score two points.]

1167
01:22:45,580 --> 01:22:46,911
That was a dunk, right?

1168
01:22:48,004 --> 01:22:50,695
[Red Team's rebirth of the Goliath.]

1169
01:22:51,402 --> 01:22:54,863
[Blue Team is now aware of
the power of the Goliath.]

1170
01:22:55,576 --> 01:22:57,519
[Just then...]

1171
01:22:57,520 --> 01:22:59,702
[Big-nose makes an unbelievable pass.]

1172
01:23:01,495 --> 01:23:04,063
[And Jae Suk's breakthrough offensive play.]

1173
01:23:08,392 --> 01:23:11,778
[Air Grasshopper!]

1174
01:23:17,592 --> 01:23:20,734
[Yoo Hyuk evens out the score
with only 30 seconds left on the clock!]

1175
01:23:25,642 --> 01:23:27,573
[A very tight game!]

1176
01:23:33,180 --> 01:23:35,735
I'd like to swap Suk Jin out
and bring Gook Joo in.

1177
01:23:35,736 --> 01:23:38,609
[With only 20 seconds left on the clock,
Bulldozer is brought into the game.]

1178
01:23:38,610 --> 01:23:40,883
Gook Joo is mine.

1179
01:23:42,089 --> 01:23:44,312
[What are you talking about?
I belong to Kkuk.]

1180
01:23:44,313 --> 01:23:46,267
[Taking their position in front of the net.]

1181
01:23:46,268 --> 01:23:47,907
One more point, and we win.

1182
01:23:48,184 --> 01:23:50,735
[Catch the ball, Kwang Soo!]

1183
01:23:51,906 --> 01:23:54,011
[Yoo Hyuk's perfect ball pass.]

1184
01:23:55,645 --> 01:23:59,021
[Current score- 8:8.
One more point for the win.]

1185
01:24:00,073 --> 01:24:06,134
[The one who scores the next goal
will determine the victor.]

1186
01:24:13,035 --> 01:24:15,873
[Giraffe misses his crucial chance!]

1187
01:24:16,799 --> 01:24:19,140
[Blue Team moves into immediate offense.]

1188
01:24:22,736 --> 01:24:25,095
[Ha Ha's no look pass.]

1189
01:24:28,190 --> 01:24:29,755
[Slam dunk!]

1190
01:24:35,463 --> 01:24:38,932
[An NBA worthy combo play!]

1191
01:24:39,584 --> 01:24:42,313
[Final score- Blue Team wins!]

1192
01:24:42,314 --> 01:24:45,087
[Blue Team for the win.]

1193
01:24:46,695 --> 01:24:49,168
[If only I hadn't missed that goal...]

1194
01:24:50,021 --> 01:24:52,550
[Victory ceremony!]

1195
01:24:55,185 --> 01:24:58,545
[Why did I do that!]

1196
01:24:58,546 --> 01:25:00,976
There are six gift boxes on the table.

1197
01:25:00,977 --> 01:25:05,538
Four of the six boxes contains
money for your rent.

1198
01:25:05,539 --> 01:25:08,365
[Four of the six boxes contains money!]

1199
01:25:08,366 --> 01:25:11,233
Two boxes containing 500,000 won.

1200
01:25:12,157 --> 01:25:14,091
One box containing 300,000 won.

1201
01:25:14,789 --> 01:25:18,435
One box containing 100,000 won,
and the rest are duds.

1202
01:25:19,075 --> 01:25:22,285
Let's go for the 300,000 won.
Ji Young shouldn't even touch anything.

1203
01:25:22,286 --> 01:25:23,775
No, I'm not choosing anything.

1204
01:25:25,824 --> 01:25:28,468
That's the one I was going to go for.

1205
01:25:29,027 --> 01:25:30,559
- Seriously?
- I was seriously going to go for that one.

1206
01:25:30,560 --> 01:25:32,467
Once I put my hand on it,
I have to pick it?

1207
01:25:33,501 --> 01:25:35,911
This was Baek Ji Young's choice.

1208
01:25:35,912 --> 01:25:38,712
One, two, three.

1209
01:25:43,711 --> 01:25:46,883
[An empty envelope!]

1210
01:25:48,374 --> 01:25:51,193
[Icon of misfortune!
She picks a dud!]

1211
01:25:51,194 --> 01:25:53,203
[Congratulations]

1212
01:25:53,204 --> 01:25:54,971
I'll go next.

1213
01:25:54,972 --> 01:25:56,201
[Fei's selection.]

1214
01:25:57,643 --> 01:26:00,026
[Expectations are high!
A pretty thick envelope.]

1215
01:26:03,324 --> 01:26:05,415
This is no joke.

1216
01:26:05,416 --> 01:26:07,875
- Is it 500,000?
- I think we got 500,000 won.

1217
01:26:08,406 --> 01:26:10,277
[500,000 won for the rent!]

1218
01:26:10,806 --> 01:26:12,721
[Jin Young's selection.]

1219
01:26:15,629 --> 01:26:17,209
Our team is so awesome.

1220
01:26:17,210 --> 01:26:20,119
[Jin Young also selects the 500,000 won box.]

1221
01:26:21,234 --> 01:26:23,895
Let's just pick whichever for our last one.

1222
01:26:23,896 --> 01:26:26,397
[Gary makes the final selection for the team.]

1223
01:26:27,240 --> 01:26:29,561
[Another thick envelope!]

1224
01:26:34,412 --> 01:26:37,221
1,300,000 won!

1225
01:26:37,222 --> 01:26:38,877
[A total of 1.3 million won for the rent!]

1226
01:26:38,878 --> 01:26:41,853
Even though we won the first two rounds,
they got the laptop computer too.

1227
01:26:41,854 --> 01:26:44,194
How about we go with the opposite
of Kwang Soo's choosing?

1228
01:26:44,706 --> 01:26:47,965
[Icon of misfortune, Kwang Soo,
makes his selection.]

1229
01:26:47,966 --> 01:26:49,997
You can't get a dud.
We need something at least.

1230
01:26:49,998 --> 01:26:53,119
[A dud?
A very thin envelope.]

1231
01:26:54,255 --> 01:26:58,129
[Opposite of whatever Kwang Soo feels
is usually the way to go.]

1232
01:26:58,130 --> 01:27:00,214
- I told you to pick that one.
- I said we should go against his choice.

1233
01:27:00,979 --> 01:27:04,712
- We at least should've gotten 100,000 won.
- Kwang Soo really is so unlucky.

1234
01:27:05,590 --> 01:27:07,569
I'm so sorry!

1235
01:27:07,570 --> 01:27:09,626
[Apologizes to his teammates.]

1236
01:27:11,370 --> 01:27:14,304
[Arrives at the final location.]

1237
01:27:15,792 --> 01:27:18,127
What is this?
Is that a stage?

1238
01:27:18,128 --> 01:27:20,926
[What is their final mission to be?]

1239
01:27:23,858 --> 01:27:27,953
[A special stage under
all the glittery lights.]

1240
01:27:27,954 --> 01:27:30,904
[And a pole?]

1241
01:27:30,905 --> 01:27:35,852
All the prizes that you've won so far
are laid out on the table behind you.

1242
01:27:35,853 --> 01:27:37,832
[All their prizes!]

1243
01:27:38,746 --> 01:27:40,790
Let's take the money and go
out to dinner.

1244
01:27:40,791 --> 01:27:46,263
All the prizes that you've worked hard
to win today will be put on the line

1245
01:27:46,264 --> 01:27:48,378
for one final mission.

1246
01:27:48,379 --> 01:27:50,084
So the winner takes all?

1247
01:27:50,085 --> 01:27:56,940
Every member of the team will take a turn
to throw a ring onto the pole you see in front

1248
01:27:57,299 --> 01:28:00,804
and if you can get all six rings
on the pole, then you win the mission.

1249
01:28:00,805 --> 01:28:03,172
- We have to get all six rings around it?
- Oh my gosh!

1250
01:28:03,173 --> 01:28:05,181
- All of us?
- In a single try?

1251
01:28:05,182 --> 01:28:08,502
If even a single person fails,
then you can't take home the prize.

1252
01:28:08,503 --> 01:28:10,702
- Then we could lose everything?
- Yes, that's right.

1253
01:28:10,703 --> 01:28:14,254
- We can't take anything home?
- Look here, what do you think you're doing?

1254
01:28:17,268 --> 01:28:18,896
That's way too harsh.

1255
01:28:21,146 --> 01:28:25,082
So if neither one of our teams win,
then this is all just over?

1256
01:28:25,083 --> 01:28:28,259
- Yes, that's correct.
- What the heck is this!

1257
01:28:28,260 --> 01:28:31,774
[But win the mission,
and it's really time to celebrate!]

1258
01:28:32,338 --> 01:28:34,876
You can decide amongst yourselves
as to which team will get to go first.

1259
01:28:36,524 --> 01:28:39,812
[They're actually given a chance
to do a practice round.]

1260
01:28:41,761 --> 01:28:44,066
- It's not easy doing it with one hand.
- That wasn't bad.

1261
01:28:47,792 --> 01:28:50,593
[The ring toss is proving to be
much more difficult than it looks.]

1262
01:28:50,594 --> 01:28:53,202
[All six members of the team must succeed.]

1263
01:28:53,203 --> 01:28:57,045
We have to do it like this,
and toss it harder than I just did.

1264
01:28:57,046 --> 01:28:59,955
- That is much better.
- Then let's just throw it like that.

1265
01:29:01,908 --> 01:29:05,359
[Much more accurate
than tossing it with one hand.]

1266
01:29:08,434 --> 01:29:12,259
[Timing and the correct amount
of strength is key.]

1267
01:29:15,375 --> 01:29:19,635
[This mission requires a precise stance
and correct usage of their strength.]

1268
01:29:22,783 --> 01:29:25,412
[That's our Ace!
Gets it right on the first try!]

1269
01:29:33,996 --> 01:29:36,772
- What was that?
- That's a fail.

1270
01:29:36,773 --> 01:29:38,502
[If the ring bounces back out,
then it's a fail.]

1271
01:29:40,379 --> 01:29:42,930
[Practice time is over!]

1272
01:29:42,931 --> 01:29:45,800
This is now the real thing.

1273
01:29:46,298 --> 01:29:50,966
[With two wins under their belt,
Red Team is given a total of two chances.]

1274
01:29:50,967 --> 01:29:54,675
[But with only one win under their belt,
Blue Team only has one chance to succeed.]

1275
01:29:54,676 --> 01:29:56,649
You have to say, 'challenge' first.

1276
01:29:56,650 --> 01:29:59,344
[Lee Gook Joo to start the game.]

1277
01:30:00,046 --> 01:30:03,430
- Don't get too nervous about it, Gook Joo.
- Challenge.

1278
01:30:05,640 --> 01:30:10,986
[The pressure of being the first to go.]

1279
01:30:10,987 --> 01:30:15,402
[Will she be able to rise above
the pressure?]

1280
01:30:20,883 --> 01:30:23,074
[Lee Gook Joo succeeds!]

1281
01:30:26,933 --> 01:30:29,551
[Bulldozer, Lee Gook Joo!]

1282
01:30:40,205 --> 01:30:43,322
[Second player for the Red Team-
Kang Seung Hyun.]

1283
01:30:44,812 --> 01:30:48,085
If I can do it,
then the rest of you can do it.

1284
01:30:57,918 --> 01:31:00,046
[Kang Seung Hyun succeeds!]

1285
01:31:04,637 --> 01:31:07,877
[Red Team makes two goals in a row!]

1286
01:31:10,594 --> 01:31:12,818
[Third player for the Red Team-
Song Ji Hyo.]

1287
01:31:14,682 --> 01:31:16,788
Song Ji Hyo, fighting!

1288
01:31:18,939 --> 01:31:21,370
[Ace throws the ring!]

1289
01:31:33,632 --> 01:31:36,219
[Ace Ji Hyo fails!]

1290
01:31:39,242 --> 01:31:42,813
[Red Team has one more chance left.]

1291
01:31:42,814 --> 01:31:44,770
No, Gook Joo can go first.

1292
01:31:44,771 --> 01:31:46,868
[With the added pressure and nervousness,
the difficulty level is on the rise.]

1293
01:31:47,407 --> 01:31:49,398
[Red Team's second attempt.]

1294
01:31:49,399 --> 01:31:52,614
[First up- Yoo Jae Suk.]

1295
01:31:53,610 --> 01:31:57,936
[All the focus is on Yoo Hyuk.]

1296
01:31:57,937 --> 01:32:01,734
[I have to make this goal!]

1297
01:32:04,184 --> 01:32:06,557
[Yoo Hyuk succeeds!]

1298
01:32:14,155 --> 01:32:16,619
[Up next- Lee Kwang Soo.]

1299
01:32:18,970 --> 01:32:22,297
[Everyone watching
feels just as nervous.]

1300
01:32:24,630 --> 01:32:27,071
[Lee Kwang Soo succeeds.]

1301
01:32:32,916 --> 01:32:35,765
[Up next- Song Ji Hyo.]

1302
01:32:36,258 --> 01:32:38,648
- Song Ji Hyo, fighting!
- Challenge.

1303
01:32:38,649 --> 01:32:44,514
[There's no failing for the second time
for Ace Ji Hyo.]

1304
01:32:56,040 --> 01:32:58,736
[Ace Blank Ji succeeds!]

1305
01:33:02,183 --> 01:33:04,781
[Up next- Lee Gook Joo.]

1306
01:33:04,782 --> 01:33:07,241
