00:00:46,055 --> 00:00:51,110
[Greeted by the delicious morning scent...]

9
00:00:52,422 --> 00:00:56,071
Ji Suk Jin didn't get much sleep last night.

10
00:00:56,072 --> 00:00:57,159
No, I didn't get much sleep.

11
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:00,262
- But Jong Kook's already had his breakfast.
- Yes, of course.

12
00:01:01,038 --> 00:01:03,973
- I had some pork for breakfast.
- This early in the morning?

13
00:01:03,974 --> 00:01:08,096
Stop tormenting your mom like that.
She stayed up all night to cook his pork.

14
00:01:08,097 --> 00:01:12,399
- She's stayed up all night to cook his food.
- You need to stop bothering your mom.

15
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,857
What are we doing today?

16
00:01:13,858 --> 00:01:19,196
Your guests for the day are taking
the bus over here right now.

17
00:01:19,197 --> 00:01:21,647
- Why?
- They're on their way here on the bus.

18
00:01:21,648 --> 00:01:23,094
[On the bus?]

19
00:01:27,459 --> 00:01:29,452
Here comes the bus.

20
00:01:32,865 --> 00:01:37,464
[The mysterious bus with
the two male guests on board.]

00:01:54,131 --> 00:01:58,095
[The crowned prince of dramas, Joo Won.]

00:02:04,603 --> 00:02:07,251
[Give Kkuk a big bear hug.]

24
00:02:08,285 --> 00:02:09,945
[Out of my way!]

25
00:02:09,946 --> 00:02:13,027
He hugged me!
He gave me a hug!

26
00:02:15,431 --> 00:02:18,674
Your face is much smaller than on screen.
You have such a small face.

27
00:02:18,675 --> 00:02:21,558
- Is this your first appearance on SBS?
- Yes, it is.

28
00:02:21,559 --> 00:02:24,558
This is my first time being on an SBS show.

29
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:28,705
- I've never been on an SBS before.
- Seriously?

30
00:02:28,706 --> 00:02:31,313
So this is your first exposure on SBS?

31
00:02:31,314 --> 00:02:32,851
[Running Man will be his first
SBS appearance.]

32
00:02:32,852 --> 00:02:37,214
Joo Won is unbelievably good looking.

33
00:02:37,215 --> 00:02:40,901
- His face is the size of my fists.
- Compare that to his face.

34
00:02:40,902 --> 00:02:43,091
- Why?
- See? His face is bigger.

35
00:02:46,202 --> 00:02:50,030
[A slight exaggeration.
He's just that good looking.]

36
00:02:50,031 --> 00:02:52,142
It would be weird if Joo Won's face
was actually that small.

37
00:02:52,143 --> 00:02:54,979
- His face is tiny though.
- He's younger than I thought he was.

38
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:56,929
Kwang Soo, have you ever met
Joo Won before?

39
00:02:56,930 --> 00:03:01,322
- I met him at some publicity event before.
- Yes, at some publicity event.

40
00:03:01,323 --> 00:03:03,857
Kwang Soo is good at tagging along
to various events.

41
00:03:04,322 --> 00:03:06,563
I was invited too!

42
00:03:08,633 --> 00:03:12,261
I saw Kwang Soo's latest movie
recently.

43
00:03:12,262 --> 00:03:15,642
I saw his latest movie,
and he really is a great actor.

44
00:03:16,395 --> 00:03:18,417
[Even Giraffe is a true actor.]

45
00:03:18,418 --> 00:03:22,747
I thought he was just a character,
but his acting really impressed me.

46
00:03:22,835 --> 00:03:27,342
Even though Kwang Soo may be a good actor,
who stood out to you the most in looks?

47
00:03:27,377 --> 00:03:28,707
You, Jong Kook.

48
00:03:30,102 --> 00:03:31,915
[Suk Chun has the hots for Jong Kook.]

49
00:03:31,916 --> 00:03:34,075
Jong Kook was getting jealous.

50
00:03:34,076 --> 00:03:37,587
- He fits right in with the rest of us.
- So you like men like Jong Kook?

51
00:03:37,588 --> 00:03:39,501
No, not necessarily.

52
00:03:39,502 --> 00:03:44,369
Out of everyone here, Ji Hyo...

53
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:46,281
[Me?]

54
00:03:46,539 --> 00:03:48,355
is the only one I'm not interested in.

55
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:53,295
[What a bewildering and funny comment.]

56
00:03:54,656 --> 00:03:56,775
- Wow, Ji Hyo!
- Why are you even here?

57
00:03:59,082 --> 00:04:01,860
I'm a member of this show.

58
00:04:02,328 --> 00:04:05,338
'I'm a member of this show.'

59
00:04:05,925 --> 00:04:08,825
Did you all see that?
Only he can get away with saying that.

60
00:04:08,826 --> 00:04:11,561
[A very unique man indeed.]

61
00:04:12,989 --> 00:04:18,327
Now that all of you are here,
I will announce the individual teams.

62
00:04:19,169 --> 00:04:23,551
The worst thing for Suk Chun right now
would be to get teamed up with Ji Hyo.

63
00:04:23,552 --> 00:04:25,510
I really don't want that.

64
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:27,926
I don't want that either!

65
00:04:28,364 --> 00:04:31,949
I don't want that either!
I wouldn't be happy with that either.

66
00:04:32,581 --> 00:04:36,076
There will be three members per team.

67
00:04:36,077 --> 00:04:41,478
Yoo Jae Suk, Lee Kwang Soo,
and Joo Won will make up a team.

68
00:04:42,247 --> 00:04:44,881
So you put all the best looking people
on one team?

69
00:04:44,882 --> 00:04:47,661
- That's just so obvious.
- It's obvious that's what you did.

70
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:49,382
Yes, it's obvious that you put
two servants next to Joo Won.

71
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:54,101
[Servants, Grasshopper and Giraffe
next to Young Master Joo Won.]

72
00:04:54,847 --> 00:04:56,882
Next team is...

73
00:04:56,883 --> 00:04:59,034
Song Ji Hyo...

74
00:04:59,493 --> 00:05:01,279
[It's not me, is it?]

75
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,859
- Gary...
- Ji Hyo!

76
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:07,819
If you put Suk Chun on that team,
then he's just going to leave.

77
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:09,529
[Suk Chun will refuse to be on the show
if included on that team?]

78
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:11,759
and Ji Suk Jin will round out the team.

79
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:15,108
[Second team-
Song Ji Hyo, Gary and Ji Suk Jin.]

80
00:05:15,109 --> 00:05:18,167
[Final team- Suk Chun, Jong Kook,
and Ha Ha.]

81
00:05:18,168 --> 00:05:19,508
This is a great team!

82
00:05:20,729 --> 00:05:27,220
Today's mission is...
A revolution of taste buds.

83
00:05:28,308 --> 00:05:30,396
You'll each be getting a case.

84
00:05:30,397 --> 00:05:32,570
- Here, take this.
- What color do you like?

85
00:05:33,405 --> 00:05:36,206
[A mysterious map of the world.]

86
00:05:38,228 --> 00:05:40,038
How do we open this?

87
00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:43,194
Seoul's Samchungdong is the
latest trend spot

88
00:05:43,195 --> 00:05:48,482
and it's a place where different cultures
from all around the world are gathered.

89
00:05:49,217 --> 00:05:50,900
There...

90
00:05:52,151 --> 00:05:53,973
you will go find the restaurants that are
indicated on the map

91
00:05:53,974 --> 00:05:57,190
and enjoy the delicious cuisines
from six different culinary backgrounds

92
00:05:57,191 --> 00:05:59,705
and complete the missions
that await you there.

93
00:05:59,706 --> 00:06:01,416
With the success of each of those missions

94
00:06:01,417 --> 00:06:04,599
you will be given a puzzle piece
to complete your puzzle.

95
00:06:05,162 --> 00:06:10,468
The puzzle pieces that you earn will become
very handy to you at your final mission.

96
00:06:10,469 --> 00:06:13,697
You will be given a chance to earn
all your puzzle pieces

97
00:06:13,698 --> 00:06:15,682
so your goal is to earn
as many as possible.

98
00:06:16,062 --> 00:06:19,441
You must now change into your team
uniforms, and get on your way.

99
00:06:20,905 --> 00:06:23,473
[Travel with your teammates to Samchungdong-
Free to choose wherever they want to go.]

100
00:06:23,474 --> 00:06:25,411
So where should we go first?

101
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:29,303
Let's go eat at
North America and Europe.

102
00:06:29,304 --> 00:06:31,826
Let's start there and eat
our way down.

103
00:06:31,827 --> 00:06:33,291
[Blue Team immediately gets on the move.]

104
00:06:36,753 --> 00:06:38,908
Look at that smile on your face.

105
00:06:38,909 --> 00:06:41,051
[Green Team is all smiles.]

106
00:06:41,052 --> 00:06:44,507
[Orange Team decides to go European style
and heads off to Samchungdong.]

107
00:06:45,261 --> 00:06:48,739
- I come here often on the weekends.
- Samchungdong is so pretty.

108
00:06:50,126 --> 00:06:54,675
- There's a lot of history there.
- Our culture is mixed in there too.

109
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:03,313
I've seen the guest on the left in a drama
where he wears a mask fighting the Japanese.

110
00:07:03,314 --> 00:07:05,978
Yes, that's our Joo Won.

111
00:07:05,979 --> 00:07:07,576
[The driver immediately recognizes
Joo Won from 'Bridal Mask'.]

112
00:07:07,577 --> 00:07:12,950
As for the taller guest, where was that...
I know I've seen him somewhere...

113
00:07:14,338 --> 00:07:16,811
[Not clear where he's seen Kwang Soo.]

114
00:07:16,812 --> 00:07:21,444
- This guy was on... what was it...
- He wasn't saying it like that.

115
00:07:21,445 --> 00:07:23,777
No, that's what he just said.

116
00:07:24,628 --> 00:07:29,339
[Arrives at the romantic town
of Samchungdong.]

117
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:32,629
Is this the European restaurant?
This is the place, isn't it?

118
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:34,313
Yes, this is the right place.

119
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:37,762
- It's this way.
- Ah, there it is.

120
00:07:38,282 --> 00:07:43,932
Wow, look at all these places.
None of these places are open yet.

121
00:07:43,933 --> 00:07:50,404
[Peaceful streets of Samchungdong
in the early hours.]

122
00:07:50,405 --> 00:07:56,754
[A special treat of being able to experience
the streets while they're still empty.]

123
00:07:58,385 --> 00:08:01,627
There are so many amazing
and beautiful places in our country

124
00:08:01,628 --> 00:08:03,517
but I haven't been able to see
many of those places.

125
00:08:03,518 --> 00:08:07,689
I've always been so disappointed by that,
so I'm very grateful for this opportunity.

126
00:08:08,981 --> 00:08:13,356
Even a simple coffee shop is
so pretty.

127
00:08:14,257 --> 00:08:20,624
All the main streets are very pretty,
but even up these stairs...

128
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:24,147
I was actually going to buy
one of these places before.

129
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:31,296
[Can't just pass by without
taking a picture or two.]

130
00:08:31,297 --> 00:08:34,721
Thanks to Gary, I get to experience
the whole European style early this morning.

131
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:37,365
It's so beautiful here.

132
00:08:37,366 --> 00:08:41,684
Doesn't it feel so weird getting to
walk around here so early in the morning?

133
00:08:41,685 --> 00:08:45,733
I wish I could sit down and write a song
in one of these cafes.

134
00:08:45,734 --> 00:08:47,777
I bet you could get
a song or two out of here.

135
00:08:47,778 --> 00:08:51,411
It's so romantic here.
Perfect for a couple to walk around.

136
00:08:51,412 --> 00:08:54,347
[Cozy little streets meant for
couples in love to stroll around.]

137
00:08:54,348 --> 00:08:56,751
- Sorry, Suk Jin.
- I'll get out of your way.

138
00:08:56,752 --> 00:08:59,103
You two can enjoy the stroll.

139
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:05,575
- Wow, this place is really nice.
- It's such a beautiful atmosphere.

140
00:09:05,576 --> 00:09:08,691
[Everyone's enamored by
the romance of Samchungdong.]

141
00:09:08,692 --> 00:09:11,765
Yes, if you keep going to the left,
then you'll come up to Chungamdong.

142
00:09:13,358 --> 00:09:20,280
[Sunlit streets of Samchungdong
in crisp summer morning.]

143
00:09:21,142 --> 00:09:23,351
Joo Won's played the role
of being the youngest for so long

144
00:09:23,352 --> 00:09:25,295
and that's why he's so good at
taking care of things like this map.

145
00:09:26,244 --> 00:09:29,461
Unlike this one who still can't do that
even though he's been our youngest.

146
00:09:30,407 --> 00:09:34,357
[Rigid young'un vs Faithful young'un.]

147
00:09:34,358 --> 00:09:37,136
Joo Won just grabbed it
without even having to be told.

148
00:09:37,137 --> 00:09:40,928
But since he's younger than even me,
I should hand down the responsibilities.

149
00:09:40,929 --> 00:09:44,066
So the first person to succeed the mission
will be given the puzzle piece?

150
00:09:44,067 --> 00:09:46,490
So it doesn't matter how many
people try to do the mission?

151
00:09:46,491 --> 00:09:51,676
With you already having experience
of doing a variety show

152
00:09:51,677 --> 00:09:53,440
you really do pick things up
very quickly.

153
00:09:53,441 --> 00:09:57,260
- I think this is the place.
- We're at the right place.

154
00:09:57,261 --> 00:09:59,761
What are they doing?

155
00:09:59,986 --> 00:10:02,213
[What are they doing?]

156
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:04,422
- It was just so pretty.
- What was pretty?

157
00:10:04,423 --> 00:10:06,914
- The streets and these steps.
- You mean Suk Chun was pretty?

158
00:10:07,558 --> 00:10:11,104
You do look very pretty.
Where are you guys headed?

159
00:10:11,105 --> 00:10:14,684
- We're headed to North America.
- You don't need to tell them that.

160
00:10:14,685 --> 00:10:19,156
- I'm sorry, but that's where we're headed.
- Then we can go together.

161
00:10:20,984 --> 00:10:22,840
What are you doing?
Where are you going?

162
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,700
[Cuts in front of them.]

163
00:10:27,701 --> 00:10:30,741
Everything is so beautiful around here.

164
00:10:30,742 --> 00:10:31,954
This is the place.

165
00:10:32,714 --> 00:10:38,789
[Blue Team and Green Team arrive
at the North American restaurant.]

166
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:40,753
It's hamburgers!

167
00:10:42,222 --> 00:10:44,067
That looks so good!

168
00:10:44,068 --> 00:10:52,176
[A sumptuous feast of
North American style brunch.]

169
00:10:52,177 --> 00:10:55,385
Jong Kook hates things like this.

170
00:10:57,436 --> 00:11:00,724
You are all here to taste
the North American style cuisine.

171
00:11:00,725 --> 00:11:04,598
- They followed us here.
- What? We were here first.

172
00:11:05,661 --> 00:11:08,232
- What did you say?
- They're envious of our team.

173
00:11:08,233 --> 00:11:10,774
We are already like
blood brothers with Joo Won.

174
00:11:10,775 --> 00:11:13,846
- He's going to be called 'Won' from now on.
- Hey!

175
00:11:13,847 --> 00:11:16,222
I told you not to talk to him
in that casual speech yet.

176
00:11:16,223 --> 00:11:19,001
- Why are you talking to him like that?
- This is how he keeps treating me!

177
00:11:19,002 --> 00:11:22,341
- He keeps acting up like this.
- Our team is like a work of art.

178
00:11:22,342 --> 00:11:25,714
Hong Suk said he's going to
set up a small shop for Jong Kook.

179
00:11:26,653 --> 00:11:29,477
I never knew you were so astute
like that!

180
00:11:29,478 --> 00:11:31,577
- That's how close we are already.
- That's right!

181
00:11:31,578 --> 00:11:34,234
Look at how red his face is getting.

182
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:36,971
It's because I've never been
in this kind of a situation before.

183
00:11:36,972 --> 00:11:39,699
I don't know how I should even react.

184
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,990
- How old are you, Joo Won?
- I'm 28 years old.

185
00:11:42,443 --> 00:11:46,231
Wow, you're so young looking!
You're already 28 years old?

186
00:11:46,232 --> 00:11:48,704
I thought you were only 23 years old.

187
00:11:48,705 --> 00:11:51,400
Look at all the wrinkles on
Kwang Soo's face.

188
00:11:51,401 --> 00:11:54,414
- His face is full of wrinkles already.
- Hey!

189
00:11:56,256 --> 00:12:00,482
Like the title of our race states,
please enjoy all the delicious food first.

190
00:12:00,483 --> 00:12:02,657
- We get to eat first?
- Yes, go ahead and eat.

191
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:04,958
[Seriously?]

192
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:07,964
I don't think Joo Won is used to
things like this.

193
00:12:08,378 --> 00:12:10,500
- You're just going to let us eat?
- See?

194
00:12:10,785 --> 00:12:12,976
He's used to having to work for his food.

195
00:12:12,977 --> 00:12:16,282
Even though there are a lot of different
foods you'll be eating throughout the day

196
00:12:16,283 --> 00:12:18,698
but since you're here now, just
enjoy the dishes being offered.

197
00:12:20,541 --> 00:12:22,944
Let's just cut it all up.

198
00:12:22,945 --> 00:12:25,570
[Yum, this is so delicious!]

199
00:12:26,294 --> 00:12:28,916
- This is good.
- Is it good?

200
00:12:28,917 --> 00:12:31,313
- Wow, this is really good.
- It really is delicious.

201
00:12:32,138 --> 00:12:35,178
Look at the sauce on his lips.

202
00:12:39,268 --> 00:12:41,956
I just said, look at the sauce
on his lips.

203
00:12:41,957 --> 00:12:44,614
[His face is now beet red.]

204
00:12:44,615 --> 00:12:47,352
Do you know how I just
reacted to that comment?

205
00:12:47,353 --> 00:12:49,332
[Face frozen in place.]

206
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:51,985
I can't even say anything
around you guys.

207
00:12:51,986 --> 00:12:55,188
- I really like Suk Chun.
- He's the best.

208
00:12:55,189 --> 00:12:57,962
[Wordlessly concentrating
on eating his food.]

209
00:12:57,963 --> 00:13:00,502
You know that I've been to your place
several times, don't you?

210
00:13:00,503 --> 00:13:02,182
Then don't come anymore.

211
00:13:02,839 --> 00:13:06,006
[What great sense of humor!]

212
00:13:06,007 --> 00:13:08,486
This is why I like Suk Chun so much.

213
00:13:08,487 --> 00:13:11,518
He really is the best.

214
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:13,054
[While Suk Chun is coldly
cutting off his own customers...]

215
00:13:13,055 --> 00:13:17,383
[Orange Team is enjoying their
European style cuisine in leisure.]

216
00:13:17,384 --> 00:13:20,168
- Comment allez vous?
- Is this a French restaurant?

217
00:13:20,169 --> 00:13:22,547
Yes, welcome to our French restaurant.

218
00:13:23,057 --> 00:13:26,078
If this is a French restaurant, why
is it in a traditional Korean building?

219
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:31,472
- This is such a beautiful setting.
- It's a collaboration of the two cultures.

220
00:13:31,473 --> 00:13:32,932
Since you guys are here

221
00:13:32,933 --> 00:13:35,639
you will get to taste
some traditional French cuisine.

222
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:38,177
- French food?
- Sea snails?

223
00:13:40,592 --> 00:13:44,018
Sea snails is what you have
with your beer.

224
00:13:44,019 --> 00:13:46,883
- I'm sorry.
- Wow!

225
00:13:46,884 --> 00:13:49,065
Is that a steak?

226
00:13:50,088 --> 00:13:52,441
Thank you!
Let's eat!

227
00:13:52,442 --> 00:13:58,071
[French style filet mignon glazed with
red wine reduction.]

228
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:02,028
[Instead of saying 'cheers',
they say, 'Jerky!']

229
00:14:06,425 --> 00:14:12,325
[The tender meat just melts in their mouths.]

230
00:14:12,326 --> 00:14:14,353
Wow, how can it be this delicious?

231
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:16,403
Wow, this is great!

232
00:14:16,404 --> 00:14:19,789
The sauce is amazing.

233
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:23,433
[The sauce that accompanies the meat
is the essence of this dish.]

234
00:14:23,434 --> 00:14:26,815
Wow, this is so delicious.
It's like heaven in my mouth.

235
00:14:31,554 --> 00:14:33,211
We've cleaned our plate.

236
00:14:33,212 --> 00:14:35,221
[No need to wash the dish,
since it's already been licked clean.]

237
00:14:35,222 --> 00:14:36,651
French cuisine is...

238
00:14:37,453 --> 00:14:40,295
'Ul-lari, kol-lari.'
(A funny saying in Korean with a twist.)

239
00:14:41,461 --> 00:14:44,885
It just amazed me,
and overtook my senses.

240
00:14:44,886 --> 00:14:47,534
Here's how I'd like to describe the dish.

241
00:14:47,535 --> 00:14:49,785
'Oh-teu, Ku-tuire.'

242
00:14:51,775 --> 00:14:55,205
- That's how I'd like to describe it.
- What does that mean?

243
00:14:55,206 --> 00:14:57,880
I don't know either.
'Oh-teu, Ku-tuire.'

244
00:14:59,181 --> 00:15:02,144
[Time to get their reaction on
their North American styled brunch.]

245
00:15:02,145 --> 00:15:06,898
I really like these types of foods.
I prefer breads and pastas over rice dishes.

246
00:15:06,899 --> 00:15:10,765
- That's what I prefer too.
- But you love strong fermented soybean stew.

247
00:15:10,766 --> 00:15:13,095
Wow, you guys are all
driving me crazy.

248
00:15:14,966 --> 00:15:18,573
Describe your impression of the dish,
and we'll get started on your mission.

249
00:15:19,835 --> 00:15:21,774
Solid.

250
00:15:23,219 --> 00:15:25,805
That's not the right way to express it.

251
00:15:25,806 --> 00:15:28,068
We'll let the other team go first.

252
00:15:28,069 --> 00:15:29,485
[Jong Kook's impression of the dish.]

253
00:15:29,486 --> 00:15:33,981
Let's see... A taste of North America
in the midst of Korean culture?

254
00:15:35,195 --> 00:15:39,166
Yeah, that's the way to describe it.
Okay, we'll go next.

255
00:15:39,167 --> 00:15:40,633
It's Joo Won's turn.

256
00:15:40,634 --> 00:15:42,473
Let's see...

257
00:15:43,331 --> 00:15:46,929
['Let's see' is all of a sudden
the newest catchphrase.]

258
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:51,182
As if my life has been missing something...

259
00:15:56,643 --> 00:15:58,778
What are you doing!

260
00:15:58,779 --> 00:16:01,472
[Since it's still morning, it deserves
a morning drama-esque reaction.]

261
00:16:01,473 --> 00:16:04,410
This is the reaction
you give in the mornings.

262
00:16:05,134 --> 00:16:08,002
I feel as if I've been reborn
with this brunch experience.

263
00:16:12,063 --> 00:16:16,853
[A dual set of morning drama reactions.]

264
00:16:19,985 --> 00:16:22,511
I will now explain the mission to everyone.

265
00:16:22,512 --> 00:16:25,701
The mission that all of you
will be participating in here will be...

266
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:28,294
is toast catching.

267
00:16:28,295 --> 00:16:31,494
- We have to catch the toast?
- Do you see the toaster in front of you?

268
00:16:31,495 --> 00:16:35,055
Toasted bread will
jump out of the toaster slot.

269
00:16:35,056 --> 00:16:36,903
You guys come up with the weirdest ideas.

270
00:16:36,904 --> 00:16:42,329
When the toast pops out of the toaster,
you have to catch the toast with your mouth.

271
00:16:42,364 --> 00:16:46,234
[Even if just one person on the team succeeds
in catching the toast, then it's a pass.]

272
00:16:46,235 --> 00:16:49,974
- It actually sounds like fun.
- Respect.

273
00:16:49,975 --> 00:16:53,312
- You guys are something else.
- It's a fun idea.

274
00:16:53,313 --> 00:16:57,447
- What do you think, Joo Won? You like it?
- This is so much better than 2 Days 1 Night.

275
00:16:59,212 --> 00:17:02,365
[I was just kidding!]

276
00:17:03,136 --> 00:17:05,611
[Blue Team takes the first turn
at toast catching.]

277
00:17:05,612 --> 00:17:08,973
Get ready, set...
The toast can pop up at any time.

278
00:17:08,974 --> 00:17:10,718
[The toast will pop at the same time.]

279
00:17:14,713 --> 00:17:17,000
You're about to start drooling.

280
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:28,277
[Toasts pops up at the speed of a bullet.]

281
00:17:30,203 --> 00:17:33,772
[A full frontal face attack
when they're least expecting it.]

282
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:39,975
- That's hard.
- I can't believe how hard that popped up!

283
00:17:41,509 --> 00:17:44,161
I can't believe I just got slapped
in the face by a slice of bread.

284
00:17:45,416 --> 00:17:48,700
- Just use the same slice instead of wasting.
- Yes, we can just do that.

285
00:17:48,701 --> 00:17:53,474
- But they're all mixed up now.
- Who cares? Just reuse them.

286
00:17:53,509 --> 00:17:56,823
It just hit him on his nose.
That bread hit Kwang Soo on his nose.

287
00:17:56,824 --> 00:17:59,704
- Come on, we can do this.
- We can do this, Joo Won.

288
00:17:59,705 --> 00:18:02,454
Let's just succeed the mission,
and head out to our next location.

289
00:18:04,124 --> 00:18:05,945
Okay, it can pop up at any time.

290
00:18:09,209 --> 00:18:10,964
What are you doing?

291
00:18:11,504 --> 00:18:14,284
[Took a bite of the toast while waiting.]

292
00:18:14,285 --> 00:18:16,889
- Look at how serious Joo Won is taking this.
- Sorry.

293
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:20,228
[The youngest of the team is focused
and determined to succeed his mission.]

294
00:18:20,229 --> 00:18:22,174
Look at how focused he is.

295
00:18:23,232 --> 00:18:24,512
Ready.

296
00:18:34,448 --> 00:18:36,247
[The toast landed on his cheek!]

297
00:18:40,495 --> 00:18:44,268
[Hardworking Joo Won is shattering
his cool image.]

298
00:18:44,269 --> 00:18:46,669
Think about your image.
You're an actor!

299
00:18:47,991 --> 00:18:50,726
That doesn't count, right?
Since I used my shoulder?

300
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:54,555
Yes, it counts.

301
00:18:54,556 --> 00:18:57,119
Yes, that should count
since he didn't use his hands.

302
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,755
[While Joo Won is busy wrestling
the toast with his mouth...]

303
00:18:58,756 --> 00:19:01,572
[There's another person fighting
with his level of patience.]

304
00:19:01,573 --> 00:19:03,236
I don't think you're going to get it.

305
00:19:03,237 --> 00:19:05,989
I'm so annoyed
and I think I'm going to lose it.

306
00:19:10,009 --> 00:19:11,809
Ugh, I'm so annoyed!

307
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:14,284
[Gary's mission is to move ten beans over
with the use of his chopsticks.]

308
00:19:14,285 --> 00:19:18,956
Okay, you're doing it!
You can do this!

309
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:22,051
- You're doing it!
- Even my sphincter is tightening up.

310
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:26,146
My fingers are cramping up.

311
00:19:27,494 --> 00:19:29,805
My fingers are seriously about to cramp up!

312
00:19:29,806 --> 00:19:33,657
[Move ten beans, pop open a soda can, and
fold a paper airplane within two minutes.]

313
00:19:33,658 --> 00:19:35,985
[Stress!]

314
00:19:36,829 --> 00:19:38,379
Amazing.

315
00:19:40,153 --> 00:19:43,925
[After having swapped their roles,
Blank Ji shows off her amazing talent.]

316
00:19:44,322 --> 00:19:46,313
[Falls in love with her all over again.]

317
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,793
- Got it!
- Okay.

318
00:19:49,794 --> 00:19:51,795
[Blank Ji succeeds her portion
of the mission at lightning speed.]

319
00:19:51,796 --> 00:19:54,688
What are you doing? Hurry!
Hurry up and open it!

320
00:19:54,689 --> 00:19:56,878
[Opening up the can is the
easiest portion of the mission...]

321
00:19:56,879 --> 00:19:59,978
[But putting Big-nose on the mission...]

322
00:19:59,979 --> 00:20:02,044
Turn it around and use your thumb!

323
00:20:04,164 --> 00:20:06,131
[Passes the second course!]

324
00:20:06,132 --> 00:20:08,592
[Now must fold and
make the paper airplane fly.]

325
00:20:08,593 --> 00:20:10,799
I have to make this perfectly.

326
00:20:12,541 --> 00:20:15,418
Just fold it however.
It doesn't have to be perfect.

327
00:20:15,419 --> 00:20:18,677
- Gary, it just has to fly!
- But I have to get it perfectly!

328
00:20:19,094 --> 00:20:21,152
[Only five seconds left on the clock!]

329
00:20:21,153 --> 00:20:24,358
Two, one!

330
00:20:26,172 --> 00:20:27,606
Pass!

331
00:20:27,607 --> 00:20:30,370
[Orange Team succeeds
their European mission.]

332
00:20:31,604 --> 00:20:33,892
I fell in love with you all over again.

333
00:20:35,793 --> 00:20:38,604
You looked so domestic.

334
00:20:38,605 --> 00:20:43,598
Since you succeeded your mission,
you win your first piece of the puzzle.

335
00:20:43,599 --> 00:20:48,200
[Orange Team wins the European puzzle.]

336
00:20:49,301 --> 00:20:51,249
- It fits perfectly.
- We got it.

337
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:54,263
Asia, Africa, North America...

338
00:20:54,264 --> 00:20:56,176
[The more puzzle pieces they collect,
more advantageous it'll be for them.]

339
00:21:02,754 --> 00:21:05,163
[North American Teams are still busy
trying to pass their toast mission.]

340
00:21:13,378 --> 00:21:17,932
[It goes in... and falls back out.]

341
00:21:17,933 --> 00:21:21,917
- It actually went in!
- But you can't have it fall back out.

342
00:21:23,427 --> 00:21:25,401
You have to bite down on it.

343
00:21:28,266 --> 00:21:32,475
That's something that I'm familiar with.
Having it fall back out of your mouth.

344
00:21:33,958 --> 00:21:36,198
Listen to this man.

345
00:21:36,199 --> 00:21:39,884
[Yoo Hyuk acts out like a brat at
the opposing team's toast mission failure.]

346
00:21:39,885 --> 00:21:42,632
Can I do it from this position?

347
00:21:42,633 --> 00:21:45,494
No kidding.
Can we do it like that?

348
00:21:47,476 --> 00:21:49,594
Joo Won knows all sorts of tricks.

349
00:21:49,595 --> 00:21:55,624
- He's good at this game stuff.
- I see now why he was on a variety show.

350
00:21:55,625 --> 00:21:58,138
He's really good.
He's really earnest about it.

351
00:21:58,139 --> 00:22:00,936
Ready, set, go!

352
00:22:09,426 --> 00:22:12,094
- Why would you close your eyes?
- You fool!

353
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:15,880
It was right over your face,
but why would your close your eyes?

354
00:22:16,552 --> 00:22:19,338
- Why did you close your eyes?
- Because I got scared.

355
00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:24,318
Yeah, instead of using your shoulder,
just have it land right on your face.

356
00:22:24,319 --> 00:22:25,835
[Jae Suk also attempts a new position.]

357
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:31,002
[Will he get it?]

358
00:22:31,003 --> 00:22:34,282
[It just grazes his tongue!]

359
00:22:34,283 --> 00:22:37,323
- That position might work!
- He almost had it!

360
00:22:38,628 --> 00:22:41,085
This is the perfect position.

361
00:22:41,086 --> 00:22:44,820
- How did you position yourself again?
- I think I was positioned like this.

362
00:22:44,821 --> 00:22:51,130
[A variety of different poses.]

363
00:22:51,131 --> 00:22:54,297
You guys look like SES.

364
00:22:54,298 --> 00:22:57,124
Looking at how we're positioned
with our mouths hanging open...

365
00:23:00,783 --> 00:23:02,220
Ready, set, go!

366
00:23:05,844 --> 00:23:06,988
[Lands on his cheek once again!]

367
00:23:06,989 --> 00:23:09,815
[But...]

368
00:23:09,816 --> 00:23:13,412
Joo Won, you look like your character
from 'Good Doctor' all over again.

369
00:23:13,413 --> 00:23:15,747
You look like your 'Good Doctor'
character again.

370
00:23:17,764 --> 00:23:19,878
You weren't even close.

371
00:23:19,879 --> 00:23:24,432
[Why are you looking so disappointed?]

372
00:23:24,433 --> 00:23:26,508
Did you see how close I got?

373
00:23:26,509 --> 00:23:28,158
Set, go!

374
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:29,614
[Back to Green Team's turn.]

375
00:23:31,896 --> 00:23:34,286
You might as well have
picked it up with your hand.

376
00:23:34,287 --> 00:23:36,366
You might as well have
picked it up with your hand.

377
00:23:36,367 --> 00:23:38,495
Why didn't you just pick it up
with your fingers instead?

378
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:42,954
- Just use your fingers instead then.
- I used my shoulders like this.

379
00:23:46,112 --> 00:23:48,426
I just used my shoulder like this.

380
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:50,922
This is the first time in four years that
I laughed at something Kwang Soo said.

381
00:23:51,824 --> 00:23:54,324
- What? I always make you laugh.
- That was too funny.

382
00:23:55,048 --> 00:23:56,937
[Next up is, Ha Ha.]

383
00:23:59,699 --> 00:24:01,794
Is that what I looked like?

384
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:04,110
So that's what I looked like.

385
00:24:10,746 --> 00:24:13,074
[Yoo-Brat is especially acting up today.]

386
00:24:17,366 --> 00:24:21,166
[Oh my goodness!]

387
00:24:21,913 --> 00:24:23,717
Kim Jong Kook is the best!

388
00:24:24,344 --> 00:24:27,356
[The toast is caught!]

389
00:24:30,586 --> 00:24:34,779
[Monstrous Mr. Capable!]

390

[Like a tiger pouncing on its prey!]

391
00:24:40,644 --> 00:24:44,510
- How could you...
- Wow, Kim Jong Kook.

392
00:24:48,252 --> 00:24:51,705
I think this is why I think
Jong Kook is the most attractive.

393

[Green Team wins
the North American puzzle piece.]

394

- Bye!
- Bye!

395
00:25:00,115 --> 00:25:04,054
- Bye, North America!
- We love it!

396
00:25:04,055 --> 00:25:06,248
- We love it!
- Bye!

397
00:25:06,249 --> 00:25:08,394
- Let's go get some soup.
- Okay, let's go.

398
00:25:08,395 --> 00:25:11,120
Let's go for the soup too.
I'm going to make them wear their soup.

and also goes for the soup.]

to the South American destination.]

401

Wow, it's so nice here.

402
00:25:21,814 --> 00:25:28,911
[Europe has nothing on this
lovely town of Samchungdong.]

403
00:25:29,474 --> 00:25:32,515
- This place has everything.
- There's a jewelry store.

404
00:25:32,516 --> 00:25:34,951
Gary, aren't you going to
buy me a diamond ring?

405
00:25:34,952 --> 00:25:38,641
I'd need some sort of a promise
before I buy you a diamond ring.

406
00:25:38,642 --> 00:25:40,948
I'd need the diamond ring first
before I make you any sort of a promise.

407
00:25:40,949 --> 00:25:43,285
Why am I even here?

408
00:25:44,859 --> 00:25:47,311
- This really is nice.
- Let's go to South America.

409

Why don't you take a picture
in front of that red storefront?

410

- Suk Jin, get in on the picture.
- Take the picture with us.

411

- This one?

420

- He has the pepero cookie in his mouth.
- You guys should assume the same pose.

421
00:26:30,401 --> 00:26:32,142
I'll take a picture of you guys
in that same pose.

422
00:26:32,143 --> 00:26:34,128
Is this good?

423
00:26:34,129 --> 00:26:37,599
- Yeah, that's perfect.
- Gary, did you not shave today?

424
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,628
Doesn't it make me look tough?

425
00:26:39,629 --> 00:26:42,172
Okay, that's good.
Hold it.

- Hello!
- Suk Chun's here.

charm of Samchungdong streets.]

It's driving me nuts having to
be with these two.

436
00:27:22,884 --> 00:27:25,083

driving me nuts.

437

[But Suk Chun really doesn't feel
any attraction towards Ji Hyo?]

It's called, 'I can hear your heart',
and you have three minutes on the clock.

441
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:49,021
The mission is a success
if even just one of you

442
00:27:49,022 --> 00:27:51,744
can get your heartbeat up above
160 beats per minute.

443

- How are we going to do that?
- You can either scream at each other...

444
00:27:54,715 --> 00:27:58,009
or you can make each other's hearts
flutter or excite one another.

445

or just jump around to get your heart beating.

- Anything is allowed in this game.
- How about kissing?

hearts race through this game of truth.]

I can hear your heart.]

Have you ever really liked me
even for one single moment?

463
00:29:13,292 --> 00:29:17,576
Even for one single moment?
Even if it was just for a mere second?

464
00:29:19,276 --> 00:29:22,288
- I have felt attracted to you in the past.
- That's practically the same thing.

465
00:29:22,289 --> 00:29:25,115
- How does that make you feel, Gary?
- If I can be of some help?

466
00:29:25,116 --> 00:29:28,458
Gary has told me in the past that
he really was interested in Ji Hyo.

467
00:29:28,459 --> 00:29:30,207
- That's for real.
- I have felt feelings for you.

468

- Your turn to ask the question, Ji Hyo.
- Have you...

469
00:29:32,686 --> 00:29:36,284
ever looked at me as a woman before?

470
00:29:36,285 --> 00:29:39,421
- We all know the answer to that question.
- I'd know if he was lying.

471
00:29:39,908 --> 00:29:41,554
I have.

472
00:29:41,555 --> 00:29:43,045
I have.

- Mine's gone up to 120.
- Why is Suk Jin's heart rate going up?

479
00:30:02,001 --> 00:30:03,837
Just looking at these two
is making my heart start to race.

480
00:30:03,838 --> 00:30:07,233
- So you've looked at me as a woman before?
- Yes, I have.

481

would you have accepted it?

You know those days when you wake up
wanting to kiss that one special person?

489
00:30:42,703 --> 00:30:45,546
- And that was my perfect opportunity.
- Really?

490
00:30:45,547 --> 00:30:48,261
- It wasn't me that did it...
- Ji Hyo's heart rate is increasing.

491
00:30:48,262 --> 00:30:51,705
It wasn't me that did it,
but it was my heart that did it.

492
00:30:51,706 --> 00:30:54,736
- Wow, that's so cool.
- It wasn't him, but it was his heart.

493
00:30:54,737 --> 00:30:58,217
- Do the 5cm test.
- Let's see if it works.

494
00:30:58,218 --> 00:31:00,904
We're just closing in
just for the sake of winning this game.

495
00:31:02,916 --> 00:31:04,693
[Closer...]

496
00:31:04,694 --> 00:31:07,752
- Don't touch!
- That's enough, Gary!

497
00:31:07,753 --> 00:31:11,009
Just touch your nose.
Just let your noses touch.

498
00:31:11,010 --> 00:31:13,169
Just let your noses touch.

499
00:31:19,697 --> 00:31:22,544
[Time over!]

500
00:31:23,299 --> 00:31:27,336
Gary's heart rate went up to 128,
and Song Ji Hyo to 115.

501
00:31:27,337 --> 00:31:30,702
- We'll play a truth game of our own.
- But you have felt attracted to me?

502
00:31:31,052 --> 00:31:33,008
Of course, I have.

503
00:31:34,462 --> 00:31:37,329
[Me too, Ji Hyo...]

504
00:31:38,376 --> 00:31:40,599
[If that doesn't get the job done,
then it's time to switch up the game plan!]

505
00:31:41,799 --> 00:31:45,953
[Gives up on making each other excited,
and it's onto the traditional method!]

506
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:52,019
[Working hard to get his heart rate up!]

507
00:31:54,656 --> 00:31:55,914
Get up!

508
00:31:56,604 --> 00:31:58,699
[Time over]

509
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:02,387
[Did his heart rate surpass the 160 mark?]

510
00:32:02,388 --> 00:32:06,990
[176- A definite success!]

511
00:32:06,991 --> 00:32:09,290
We should've done this right
from the start!

512
00:32:09,291 --> 00:32:11,964
Why did you have to exploit our love?

513
00:32:16,809 --> 00:32:20,105
[Coach Kkuk steps in to train his members.]

514
00:32:23,458 --> 00:32:26,597
[Kicking his legs back automatically.]

515
00:32:31,464 --> 00:32:33,755
- You're such a cute jumper.
- That's so cute.

516
00:32:37,405 --> 00:32:39,129
Kick your knees higher.

517
00:32:39,130 --> 00:32:41,841
[His heart his bouncing-
Coach Kkuk's hard training.]

518
00:32:43,683 --> 00:32:46,140
We're stopping because I think
this is getting too dangerous.

519
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:50,358
- How high is it?
- It's at 182.

520
00:32:53,883 --> 00:32:57,317
[Green Team succeeds by a mile!]

521
00:32:58,166 --> 00:32:59,822
Suk Chun.

522
00:32:59,823 --> 00:33:02,111
I guess you and I are definitely older.

523
00:33:04,719 --> 00:33:08,370
You can put the puzzle piece in
the puzzle that you have in the case.

524
00:33:08,371 --> 00:33:10,484
[Both teams win
the South American puzzle piece.]

525
00:33:10,485 --> 00:33:12,881
- How many do you have?
- We have two.

526
00:33:13,754 --> 00:33:16,551
Okay, South America.

527
00:33:17,741 --> 00:33:21,560
[North and South America-
Green Team completes America portion.]

528
00:33:21,561 --> 00:33:23,018
- Let's go to Asia now.
- Okay.

529
00:33:23,858 --> 00:33:25,764
[At the same time.]

530
00:33:26,366 --> 00:33:29,157
- It's much nicer when you succeed.
- Yes, it's much better.

531
00:33:29,158 --> 00:33:30,754
We couldn't have done it without you, Joo Won.

532
00:33:30,755 --> 00:33:33,881
- Where should we go this time?
- Let's go to Asia.

533
00:33:33,882 --> 00:33:36,285
Okay, let's go to Asia.

534
00:33:36,286 --> 00:33:40,845
- Samchungdong really is nice.
- Yes, and it's very peaceful.

535
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:43,919
[More they see, the more in love they
are with the streets of Samchungdong.]

536
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:47,093
Joo Won, isn't this town so pretty?

537
00:33:47,094 --> 00:33:49,693
- Bye!
- See you later!

538
00:33:51,331 --> 00:33:54,598
- I want to go on a date to a place like this.
- That's what we're doing right now.

539
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:56,214
Okay, let's go out on a date.

540
00:33:56,800 --> 00:34:00,003
We've just been proven not to
have any feelings for each other.

541
00:34:00,379 --> 00:34:03,445
We've just been proven not to
have any feelings for each other.

542
00:34:03,446 --> 00:34:06,523
No, we're even holding hands
and are out on a date right now.

543
00:34:06,524 --> 00:34:09,710
- Want me to leave you guys alone?
- No, you really are attractive.

544
00:34:09,711 --> 00:34:12,340
- You're pretty.
- I really do think that you're attractive.

545
00:34:12,341 --> 00:34:15,409
Are you confessing your feelings for
each other after all these years?

546
00:34:15,410 --> 00:34:18,504
Even though I've told you this before,
you're really attractive when you're on stage.

547
00:34:18,505 --> 00:34:21,764
When you're singing on stage with your mic
with your stomach sticking out.

548
00:34:21,765 --> 00:34:23,921
You're always pretty, Ji Hyo.

549
00:34:24,361 --> 00:34:26,977
Finally confessing your feelings for
each other after four long years.

550
00:34:26,978 --> 00:34:29,203
I really do think that you're pretty, Ji Hyo.

551
00:34:31,374 --> 00:34:33,651
Why are you leaning into my arms?

552
00:34:34,377 --> 00:34:36,194
It's because we're such good friends.

553
00:34:36,195 --> 00:34:39,034
And we're in this beautiful town
of Samchungong.

554
00:34:39,035 --> 00:34:43,289
The fact that three men are walking together
in the rain like this...

555
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:45,432
It really is a beautiful thing.

556
00:34:45,433 --> 00:34:48,694
Do you know that the two of you are
poking me with your umbrellas right now?

557
00:34:48,695 --> 00:34:53,408
That's because you're so tall.
It's not mine or Joo Won's fault.

558
00:35:00,117 --> 00:35:02,008
Wow, this is nice.

559
00:35:03,721 --> 00:35:05,710
What are you thinking about, Joo Won?

560
00:35:06,423 --> 00:35:09,226
It's always been a dream of mine to open
a coffee shop around a place like this.

561
00:35:09,227 --> 00:35:10,604
- Really?
- Yes.

562
00:35:10,605 --> 00:35:13,492
- That's a nice dream.
- I really love coffee.

563
00:35:13,493 --> 00:35:15,248
- You like coffee?
- Yes.

564
00:35:15,249 --> 00:35:16,893
I like coffee too.

565
00:35:16,894 --> 00:35:18,910
- I think this is the place.
- Here?

566
00:35:18,911 --> 00:35:22,720
[Finally arrives at the Asian restaurant.]

567
00:35:22,721 --> 00:35:24,531
Asia.

568
00:35:25,872 --> 00:35:28,864
You have to stop by the Asian place.

569
00:35:28,865 --> 00:35:33,503
- Is it rice noodles?
- But they're all different.

570
00:35:34,678 --> 00:35:37,032
[Today is an all you can eat buffet
of different cuisines from worldwide.]

571
00:35:37,033 --> 00:35:38,500
Try this one.

572
00:35:41,576 --> 00:35:44,350
- Hello.
- Hello.

573
00:35:47,828 --> 00:35:54,102
- You guys must be here to lose again.
- Sorry, but you keep getting in our path.

574
00:35:54,103 --> 00:35:56,633
Sorry, but we were here first.

575
00:35:57,806 --> 00:36:00,205
- It's rice noodles.
- Rice noodles?

576
00:36:01,712 --> 00:36:09,540
[Full of oriental flavors...
enough to get your taste buds going.]

577
00:36:12,704 --> 00:36:16,114
[Time to hand out the mission
for the Asian puzzle piece.]

578
00:36:17,027 --> 00:36:19,411
- This is a bowl of noodles.
- What do we do with this?

579
00:36:19,412 --> 00:36:20,726
What is this?

580
00:36:20,727 --> 00:36:25,391
The mission you'll be doing here is called,
'Rice noodle squad.'

581
00:36:25,392 --> 00:36:30,837
You have to stick ten strands of noodles
on one member's face...

582
00:36:30,838 --> 00:36:32,813
Then we have to shoot it off
with the water gun?

583
00:36:32,814 --> 00:36:35,163
[Shoot off the noodle strands
with the water gun.]

584
00:36:35,164 --> 00:36:38,002
Don't stick it on my face
like it's a foregone conclusion.

585
00:36:38,003 --> 00:36:40,631
If we have to do this anyways,
then how about we do this?

586
00:36:40,632 --> 00:36:44,612
Stand the two people up against the wall,
and see who can get them all off the fastest.

587
00:36:44,613 --> 00:36:47,871
[Both teams to go at the same time
to see who can be the first to win.]

588
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:50,377
- I bet we'll beat you guys.
- Fine, let's do it.

589
00:36:50,378 --> 00:36:52,959
Okay, let's do it.
- Let's pick the member for each other.

590
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,733
- We pick Suk Chun.
- We'll go with Suk Chun.

591
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:59,494
[Rice noodle wallpaper- Suk Chun.]

592
00:36:59,495 --> 00:37:02,720
[Suk Chun vs Kwang Soo.]

593
00:37:02,721 --> 00:37:05,898
Suk Chun, you really are...

594
00:37:05,899 --> 00:37:08,707
I feel like I've seen you on
'Pirates of the Caribbean.'

595
00:37:09,485 --> 00:37:12,179
[Octopus face and Rice noodle face.]

596
00:37:12,687 --> 00:37:16,485
- Okay, Kwang Soo's ready.
- We have to do this fast.

597
00:37:21,604 --> 00:37:23,664
My water gun is too weak!

598
00:37:23,665 --> 00:37:25,870
[Rice noodle sniper.]

599
00:37:26,788 --> 00:37:29,332
[Water gun face massage.]

600
00:37:35,096 --> 00:37:38,306
[Green Team wins!]

601
00:37:41,435 --> 00:37:46,339
[Sticky rice noodle Band-Aid
on Kwang Soo's face.]

602
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:48,396
That was too easy of a win.

603
00:37:51,174 --> 00:37:54,826
[Green Teams beats the Blue Team again
and takes the puzzle piece for Asia.]

604
00:37:54,827 --> 00:37:56,240
Then is the puzzle piece to Asia gone?

605
00:37:56,241 --> 00:38:00,710
- Since this was a competition...
- But we worked really hard.

606
00:38:00,711 --> 00:38:03,541
The puzzle piece should be closed out
for Asia.

607
00:38:03,542 --> 00:38:07,590
But we will give you guys one
more chance to win the puzzle piece.

608
00:38:07,591 --> 00:38:09,616
- Give us one more chance.
- Okay.

609
00:38:09,617 --> 00:38:11,845
- If we lose this time, then we'll walk away.
- Bow down to us in gratitude.

610
00:38:12,632 --> 00:38:15,605
[Yoo Hyuk is the only one too proud
to beg for their chance.]

611
00:38:15,606 --> 00:38:18,033
[His darn pride.]

612
00:38:18,034 --> 00:38:20,623
Do you have a back problem?
What's wrong with you?

613
00:38:21,323 --> 00:38:24,109
[Yoo Hyuk is the only one
made to do it again.]

614
00:38:26,782 --> 00:38:30,704
[Bows down with Kwang Soo's help.]

615
00:38:31,817 --> 00:38:34,127
That was my pride!

616
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:37,145
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

617
00:38:37,146 --> 00:38:39,926
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

618
00:38:40,809 --> 00:38:44,109
[Green Team leaves after having
insulted the Blue Team.]

619
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:47,201
Kwang Soo, we're going to Africa next,
so bring this with you to Africa.

620
00:38:47,202 --> 00:38:50,342
- So bring it with you, okay?
- Yes, Sir.

621
00:38:50,343 --> 00:38:52,786
Ugh, I'm so angry right now.

622
00:38:53,210 --> 00:38:56,963
[Meanwhile, Gary is busy trying
his hand at the toast challenge.]

623
00:38:59,001 --> 00:39:03,351
[Finally bites down
after 30 minutes of trying.]

624
00:39:03,352 --> 00:39:04,931
Okay, success.

625
00:39:04,932 --> 00:39:08,235
[Random Mr. Capable's success.]

626
00:39:08,236 --> 00:39:11,029
I almost didn't make it back home tonight.
I really wasn't going to go home.

627
00:39:11,030 --> 00:39:12,481
We did it.

628
00:39:12,482 --> 00:39:14,576
I feel so much better now.

629
00:39:14,577 --> 00:39:16,818
[A man of persistence, Kang Gary.]

630
00:39:22,166 --> 00:39:24,035
We just got a text.

631
00:39:26,112 --> 00:39:27,766
We got a text.

632
00:39:27,767 --> 00:39:30,669
[A text message is sent to all
three teams.]

633
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:33,580
A special shop where you can win
the gold puzzle piece has just opened.

634
00:39:33,581 --> 00:39:36,883
A special shop where you can win
the gold puzzle piece has just opened.

635
00:39:36,884 --> 00:39:39,036
Please go to 'H' restaurant in
Samchungdong.

636
00:39:39,037 --> 00:39:42,021
Please go to 'H' restaurant in
Samchungdong.

637
00:39:42,022 --> 00:39:44,886
So this is a special mission, right?

638
00:39:44,887 --> 00:39:47,982
We have to win this puzzle piece.

639
00:39:47,983 --> 00:39:53,445
[The identity of the gold puzzle piece
still remains a mystery to all the members.]

640
00:39:53,446 --> 00:39:55,024
Okay, let's go.

641
00:39:55,025 --> 00:39:58,808
[The puzzle piece that will give them an
unbelievable advantage at the final mission!]

642
00:39:58,809 --> 00:40:02,086
Hello!
This place truly is very beautiful.

643
00:40:02,087 --> 00:40:05,535
- Look, the flag is gold.
- This is the place.

644
00:40:05,536 --> 00:40:09,467
I think we're the first ones here, right?

645
00:40:09,502 --> 00:40:10,882
Here it is.

646
00:40:17,934 --> 00:40:22,027
[Meet each other again.]

647
00:40:22,028 --> 00:40:24,502
Seriously.
Give them their case.

648
00:40:28,202 --> 00:40:30,042
[What's with the expression?]

649
00:40:30,043 --> 00:40:34,437
- You guys were so happy earlier.
- Happy about what?

650
00:40:34,438 --> 00:40:37,379
Okay, everyone bow down.

651
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:39,677
What a joke.

652
00:40:41,573 --> 00:40:45,916
[As long as you're in a Korean restaurant,
time to taste some Korean cuisine.]

653
00:40:45,917 --> 00:40:49,797
[Kalgguksu with a variety of toppings...]

654
00:40:49,798 --> 00:40:54,038
[and handmade giant dumplings.]

655
00:40:57,274 --> 00:40:59,119
These are all my favorite foods.

656
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:04,507
- This kimchi is amazing.
- Napa cabbage is really cheap right now.

657
00:41:04,508 --> 00:41:07,931
Since the farmers works so hard for us,
you have to consume a lot of napa cabbage.

658
00:41:07,932 --> 00:41:10,556
You have to eat a lot of onions
and napa cabbage.

659
00:41:13,688 --> 00:41:16,877
- We haven't seen you guys all day!
- I want some kalgguksu too.

660
00:41:16,878 --> 00:41:18,938
It's really good.

661
00:41:18,939 --> 00:41:21,341
Thank you for the delicious food.

662
00:41:21,342 --> 00:41:25,563
[Please enjoy your meal.]

663
00:41:29,429 --> 00:41:33,295
[Comforting, and hearty hot broth.]

664
00:41:33,296 --> 00:41:38,711
How many puzzle pieces
have you all gained so far?

665
00:41:38,712 --> 00:41:40,210
- Three.
- Three?

666
00:41:40,211 --> 00:41:43,436
- Asia, North and South America.
- Asia, North and South America?

667
00:41:43,437 --> 00:41:46,153
Europe, North and South America.
- Okay.

668
00:41:46,154 --> 00:41:49,192
Europe, North America, and Asia.

669
00:41:50,049 --> 00:41:52,307
- You guys got the North American piece?
- Yes.

670
00:41:52,308 --> 00:41:54,508
- You guys got the North American piece?
- Yes.

671
00:41:54,836 --> 00:42:00,746
[But the Blue Team failed
the toast mission...]

672
00:42:02,387 --> 00:42:04,126
[The puzzle piece really is there?]

673
00:42:04,127 --> 00:42:06,518
They switched the case on us!

674
00:42:09,158 --> 00:42:11,554
- No, this is ours.
- No, we didn't.

675
00:42:11,555 --> 00:42:14,205
[The names on the puzzle
definitely are the Blue Team...]

676
00:42:15,566 --> 00:42:19,083
[What really happened?]

677
00:42:20,012 --> 00:42:23,799
[After having succeeded
the insulting Asian mission...]

678
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:25,931
- That's not ours.
- This isn't ours?

679
00:42:26,599 --> 00:42:28,753
But they left this behind.

680
00:42:28,754 --> 00:42:30,184
[The case that the Green Team left behind
for them to bring...]

681
00:42:30,185 --> 00:42:35,195
[Without even a moment's hesitation,
they steal a puzzle piece...]

682
00:42:35,196 --> 00:42:38,905
- Why would they leave it behind?
- Let's just take one.

683
00:42:38,906 --> 00:42:41,321
[Takes the North American puzzle piece
and sticks it onto their own puzzle...]

684
00:42:41,951 --> 00:42:44,740
We pretty much succeeded
the North American mission ourselves.

685
00:42:44,741 --> 00:42:46,502
Yes, we did.

686
00:42:46,503 --> 00:42:49,016
[Thus, the North American puzzle piece
becomes Blue Team's property...]

687
00:42:50,193 --> 00:42:53,936
- Hand it over.
- This has our names on it.

688
00:42:53,937 --> 00:42:56,641
- What are you talking about?
- You guys took our puzzle piece.

689
00:42:56,642 --> 00:42:59,581
Kwang Soo, your mouth is hanging open.

690
00:42:59,582 --> 00:43:02,048
- It's because he's eating.
- Your mouth is hanging open right now.

691
00:43:02,049 --> 00:43:04,261
That means that you're lying,
so hand it over.

692
00:43:04,262 --> 00:43:08,995
Come on, just hand it over.
The PD's can tell us if you're lying.

693
00:43:12,137 --> 00:43:14,659
We don't know,
so you guys take care of it.

694
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:20,380
- Jong Kook will take care of it.
- We didn't see it, so we don't know.

695
00:43:20,381 --> 00:43:24,103
The most important thing is,
we all have to get to the final location.

696
00:43:24,104 --> 00:43:27,377
But your puzzle pieces will play
a crucial role at the final mission.

697
00:43:27,378 --> 00:43:29,777
It's extremely important.

698
00:43:29,778 --> 00:43:33,084
I told you that you can earn your golden
puzzle piece at this location, right?

699
00:43:33,931 --> 00:43:37,187
[And the big power player...]

700
00:43:37,188 --> 00:43:41,151
[A pure gold puzzle piece.]

701
00:43:41,152 --> 00:43:46,338
There are two of these pure gold
puzzle pieces to be won in this location.

702
00:43:46,339 --> 00:43:50,459
[Only two teams can win
the gold puzzle piece.]

703
00:43:52,233 --> 00:43:53,449
Okay, let's get started.

704
00:43:53,450 --> 00:43:55,889
- You seem very motivated.
- Yes, of course.

705
00:43:55,890 --> 00:43:58,929
- We're done eating.
- The mission you'll be doing here...

706
00:43:58,930 --> 00:44:01,277
Is 'Flipper jump roping.'

707
00:44:01,278 --> 00:44:06,826
You'll enter the swinging jump rope one by one
after donning on your flippers.

708
00:44:06,827 --> 00:44:11,020
The counting will begin once all the
members have entered the jump rope

709
00:44:11,021 --> 00:44:13,325
and must jump 20 times.

710
00:44:13,326 --> 00:44:18,513
I used to play jump rope all the time with
the girls when I was in elementary school.

711
00:44:19,716 --> 00:44:22,054
- This is my game.
- Okay.

712
00:44:22,055 --> 00:44:24,874
I won't tell you this again,
but take good care of your own cases.

713
00:44:24,875 --> 00:44:27,990
You have to take care of your own cases.

714
00:44:27,991 --> 00:44:30,454
The case is your responsibility...

715
00:44:30,455 --> 00:44:34,218
I'm telling you this right now,
but at one point while you're walking...

716
00:44:34,219 --> 00:44:39,636
you're going to find yourself lying flat
on your back with your case in your hands.

717
00:44:41,630 --> 00:44:45,478
[Nothing but laughter comes out of his mouth
from the fear of what's to come.]

718
00:44:47,459 --> 00:44:50,638
- Now let's go out and start the mission.
- Let's go!

719
00:44:50,639 --> 00:44:55,527
[Time to go outside and attempt the mission
to earn the gold puzzle piece.]

720
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:02,411
Give me back our North America.

721
00:45:02,872 --> 00:45:03,989
Just leave it.

722
00:45:03,990 --> 00:45:06,907
It's better to just flip them onto their backs
when they're least expecting it.

723
00:45:08,559 --> 00:45:12,585
They're going to be out flat on their backs
while doing the jump rope mission.

724
00:45:12,586 --> 00:45:15,234
It's because I know what that feels like,
that I feel even more afraid.

725
00:45:16,396 --> 00:45:19,310
Okay, let's do this.
Let's get it done on our first try.

726
00:45:19,311 --> 00:45:21,238
[Blue Team to go first.]

727
00:45:21,239 --> 00:45:24,924
- Who wants to go first?
- I'll go in the middle.

728
00:45:24,925 --> 00:45:28,283
- Then Joo Won go first.
- Okay, let's get started.

729
00:45:28,284 --> 00:45:32,152
['Flipper jump rope'- Blue Team.]

730
00:45:36,244 --> 00:45:39,300
[First jumper- Joo Won.]

731
00:45:39,301 --> 00:45:42,476
Your turn, Kwang Soo.

732
00:45:42,477 --> 00:45:46,848
You have to get in right now,
or Joo Won will die!

733
00:45:46,849 --> 00:45:49,282
- Wait.
- Hurry up and get in there!

734
00:45:49,283 --> 00:45:52,162
Get in!

735
00:45:53,732 --> 00:46:00,318
[As soon as he jumps in... he fails.]

736
00:46:00,319 --> 00:46:03,179
- This is really hard!
- Are you kidding me!

737
00:46:03,180 --> 00:46:05,532
[The nicest youngest member helps
the loser older member get up.]

738
00:46:05,966 --> 00:46:09,235
[On the other hand, the oldest member
chastises the middle member.]

739
00:46:09,236 --> 00:46:14,117
When the rope smacks down on the ground,
that's when you jump in!

740
00:46:14,118 --> 00:46:15,746
[Yoo Hyuk's mouth is busier
than the moving jump rope.]

741
00:46:15,747 --> 00:46:18,458
You're doing good though, Joo Won.

742
00:46:18,459 --> 00:46:21,415
- We can do this.
- Joo Won's really good.

743
00:46:21,416 --> 00:46:24,890
[Look at what's going on here.]

744
00:46:25,601 --> 00:46:28,834
[While Blue Team's attention
is diverted elsewhere...]

745
00:46:28,835 --> 00:46:32,853
[Ha Ha is busy stealing their puzzle piece.]

746
00:46:33,860 --> 00:46:37,107
- Look at what a cute jumper he is.
- Suk Chun is going to exhaust himself.

747
00:46:37,108 --> 00:46:40,903
- Take care of your own case.
- What are you doing?

748
00:46:40,904 --> 00:46:42,863
- What did you just do?
- I brought it back to you guys.

749
00:46:42,864 --> 00:46:46,178
You're in trouble if you took our
North America away from us.

750
00:46:51,648 --> 00:46:55,297
[Did their North America disappear?]

751
00:46:55,298 --> 00:46:59,719
[All the puzzle pieces are gone.]

752
00:47:00,879 --> 00:47:03,949
We just need one more puzzle piece.

753
00:47:03,950 --> 00:47:05,852
[The back and forth thievery.]

754
00:47:07,082 --> 00:47:10,235
[Green Team's turn at the challenge.]

755
00:47:10,236 --> 00:47:12,623
Why are you holding onto your case?

756
00:47:12,624 --> 00:47:14,947
He's afraid we're going to take it.

757
00:47:24,027 --> 00:47:26,563
That's because he was holding
onto the case.

758
00:47:27,439 --> 00:47:33,774
[The Tiger kept the case protected,
but lost his face in his attempt.]

759
00:47:34,826 --> 00:47:37,586
[But he still won't let the case
out of his possession.]

760
00:47:44,772 --> 00:47:49,479
[But thanks to that attempt, we
witnessed some good slapstick comedy.]

761
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:51,994
Having him of all people fall down
is what made it so funny.

762
00:47:52,677 --> 00:47:56,533
I can't let this out of my sight though.

763
00:47:56,534 --> 00:47:58,824
We're going to go in from here.

764
00:47:58,825 --> 00:48:02,223
[Orange Team's turn at the challenge.]

765
00:48:02,224 --> 00:48:04,353
Go in when the rope touches ground?

766
00:48:07,075 --> 00:48:09,282
Gary's really good.

767
00:48:11,841 --> 00:48:13,417
[Big-nose's turn.]

768
00:48:20,414 --> 00:48:23,033
[Never changing Big-nose.]

769
00:48:23,034 --> 00:48:25,287
You're really killing my flow!

770
00:48:27,209 --> 00:48:29,423
Gary just said that he's killing his flow.

771
00:48:29,424 --> 00:48:32,647
I can't have him doing that
every single time.

772
00:48:32,648 --> 00:48:35,745
He couldn't say it any other way,
so he says he killed his flow.

773
00:48:35,746 --> 00:48:38,763
- He should've at least jumped in there.
- That was the best expression.

774
00:48:38,764 --> 00:48:41,258
- You should've at least gotten in there.
- I'll go in first.

775
00:48:45,285 --> 00:48:48,850
[Blue Team's second attempt.]

776
00:48:50,653 --> 00:48:52,827
Joo Won's really good!

777
00:48:52,828 --> 00:48:55,115
[Joo Won easily succeeds
jumping into the fray.]

778
00:48:59,033 --> 00:49:02,381
[Even Yoo Hyuk succeeds at
jumping into the moving jump rope.]

779
00:49:02,382 --> 00:49:04,309
[Now it's the black hole, Kwang Soo's turn.]

780
00:49:04,310 --> 00:49:06,281
Hurry up and jump in!

781
00:49:10,103 --> 00:49:13,237
[Even Kwang Soo succeeds!
Time to start counting!]

782
00:49:13,238 --> 00:49:16,997
Five, six, seven...

783
00:49:16,998 --> 00:49:19,979
[Perfectly in sync.]

784
00:49:21,675 --> 00:49:24,985
[Win the gold puzzle piece
by jumping 20 times.]

785
00:49:26,303 --> 00:49:30,081
[Doesn't let the interference get to them,
and just continues to jump.]

786
00:49:38,059 --> 00:49:40,463
[20 jumps- Succeeds!]

787
00:49:47,625 --> 00:49:52,344
[Blue Team succeeds the flipper
jump rope in first place.]

788
00:49:52,345 --> 00:49:54,273
This was pure determination.

789
00:49:54,274 --> 00:49:56,205
Congratulations.

790
00:49:56,799 --> 00:50:01,404
[Blue Team earns the first puzzle piece.]

791
00:50:02,418 --> 00:50:05,408
[This is what victory tastes like!]

792
00:50:10,947 --> 00:50:15,805
[Onto the final location after having
completed the tasting tour.]

793
00:50:17,478 --> 00:50:20,535
[A university campus in the city of Seoul.]

794
00:50:20,536 --> 00:50:27,182
[It's already lunch time on this street
bustling with youth and vigor.]

795
00:50:28,944 --> 00:50:31,451
- Did you all enjoy your food today?
- Yes.

796
00:50:33,354 --> 00:50:35,869
It's now time for your final mission.

797
00:50:35,870 --> 00:50:39,967
The final mission is,
'Fusion instant cooking battle.'

798
00:50:39,968 --> 00:50:42,234
[DIY Fusion Instant Cooking Battle.]

799
00:50:42,235 --> 00:50:45,090
[Do it yourself-
Cook the dishes yourselves.]

800
00:50:45,091 --> 00:50:47,376
- We have to use a variety of ingredients.
- But Suk Chun's a chef.

801
00:50:47,377 --> 00:50:49,644
[Restaurant owner, Suk Chun,
could be at an advantage?]

802
00:50:49,645 --> 00:50:53,917
You got to taste the cuisine from all around
the world during your missions today.

803
00:50:54,718 --> 00:50:59,334
[The different cuisines from all around
the world that they got to taste...]

804
00:50:59,335 --> 00:51:02,622
You have to utilize that experience
to cook a dish yourself

805
00:51:02,623 --> 00:51:06,495
and earn the highest level of stars
in order to win the cooking battle.

806
00:51:06,496 --> 00:51:13,357
You will only be using instant and frozen
ingredients during this battle.

807
00:51:14,126 --> 00:51:16,933
- No other ingredients will be allowed.
- This is my specialty.

808
00:51:16,934 --> 00:51:23,088
There are four coolers containing
your ingredients in front of you.

809
00:51:23,089 --> 00:51:27,217
They're filled with easily obtainable
instant and frozen ingredients.

810
00:51:27,218 --> 00:51:32,571
You all earned your share of puzzle pieces
throughout the day, right?

811
00:51:33,218 --> 00:51:37,043
You can exchange one puzzle piece
for one of these ingredients.

812
00:51:38,763 --> 00:51:43,332
You can only get the ingredient from
the same colored cooler as your puzzle piece

813
00:51:43,333 --> 00:51:45,110

01:02:13,769 --> 01:02:18,806
[Even the cocktail shrimp is done cooking.]

974
01:02:21,073 --> 01:02:23,199
One piece of the scallion...

975
01:02:26,919 --> 01:02:32,339
- The scallion is breaking.
- No, you have to skewer it like this.

976
01:02:33,211 --> 01:02:37,490
[The endless possibilities of kebobs.]

977
01:02:39,596 --> 01:02:41,771
Now the shrimp.
Skewer it on like this?

978
01:02:41,772 --> 01:02:45,543
- Don't you think that'll look prettier?
- I think cutting it would be better.

979
01:02:45,544 --> 01:02:47,655
Cutting it too small wouldn't be good either.

980
01:02:47,656 --> 01:02:50,735
Let's just keep the shape of it.

981
01:02:50,736 --> 01:02:53,629
Isn't it pretty?
What do you think, Gary?

982
01:02:53,630 --> 01:02:57,346
[It's a very pretty presentation!]

983
01:02:57,347 --> 01:03:01,719
- What about when you wrap the pasta?
- Shouldn't we cook the scallion first?

984
01:03:01,720 --> 01:03:05,553
No, I don't think we need to
cook the scallion.

985
01:03:05,554 --> 01:03:08,808
- This is starting to look good.
- How about wrapping it with the scallion?

986
01:03:08,809 --> 01:03:12,168
With the scallion?
I think we should just fry it like this.

987
01:03:12,169 --> 01:03:15,185
I think we can just fry it like that too.

988
01:03:15,186 --> 01:03:18,077
But we can't do anything about that.

989
01:03:19,575 --> 01:03:21,441
Should we stick it together
with sticky grains of rice?

990
01:03:23,150 --> 01:03:25,330
How about using rice as the glue?

991
01:03:25,331 --> 01:03:27,937
[What will become of their kebobs?]

992
01:03:29,081 --> 01:03:31,614

[How will the minced steak
play into the dumplings?]

994
01:03:39,594 --> 01:03:42,483
- Can you slice the rice cakes?
- The rice cakes?

995
01:03:42,484 --> 01:03:46,572
- It'll be deconstructed dumplings.
- So they stick together?

996
01:03:46,573 --> 01:03:47,944
[Steak and rice cake fusion.]

997
01:03:47,945 --> 01:03:49,908
- I'm going to take them out.
- Okay.

998
01:03:57,214 --> 01:04:02,807
[Plan is to use the rice cakes as a binder
to fuse the ingredients together.]

and rice cakes together to make dumplings.]

[Chef Tiger is in charge of
shaping the dumplings.]

1001
01:04:20,557 --> 01:04:22,648
How big do you want these?

1002
01:04:22,649 --> 01:04:24,888
- That's good.
- Like this?

1003
01:04:25,493 --> 01:04:28,081
[First of the dumplings
start to take their shape.]

1004
01:04:28,082 --> 01:04:31,949
- This is coming together.
- They're really working out very well.

1005
01:04:31,950 --> 01:04:35,409
[Second dumpling- Adds the cooked spaghetti
to the minced steak bits.]

1006
01:04:35,410 --> 01:04:39,480
So you're going to shape them
into dumplings too?

1007
01:04:39,481 --> 01:04:42,285
Wow, that's a fantastic idea.

1008
01:04:43,645 --> 01:04:47,012
[Second of the tri dumplings-
Spaghetti dumplings takes shape.]

1009
01:04:50,203 --> 01:04:54,748
- We need to pick up the pace.
- Okay, I'll speed it up.

1010
01:04:55,126 --> 01:04:58,793
[Chef Hong's third dumpling-
Chili chicken and scallion dumplings.]

1011
01:04:59,542 --> 01:05:02,213
Add the bread crumbs.
I think that'll help.

1012
01:05:02,214 --> 01:05:05,896
This helps binds it all together.

1013
01:05:08,144 --> 01:05:11,885
[Adds the breadcrumbs to bind the
chili chicken and the scallions together.]

1014
01:05:11,886 --> 01:05:14,179
- Ha Ha's good.
- That's good.

1015
01:05:14,716 --> 01:05:17,451
How about adding in some
parmesan cheese?

1016
01:05:17,452 --> 01:05:22,771
- Like Jamie Oliver?
- How about you take the lead?

1017
01:05:34,099 --> 01:05:40,887
[Snowy white breadcrumbs
falling from the sky...]

1018

Only thing left to do is to fry them...]

1022
01:06:08,538 --> 01:06:11,233
What do you want to do with these, Joo Won?
Want me to boil it?

1023
01:06:11,234 --> 01:06:13,527
- Let's see how to cook it.
- You can't boil the chicken.

1024
01:06:13,528 --> 01:06:19,170
No, you can't boil it.
Either deep fry or pan fry it.

1025
01:06:19,923 --> 01:06:22,729
- We have to cook it all the way through.
- You can take care of it.

1026
01:06:28,897 --> 01:06:31,611
You look like a chicken frying expert.

1027
01:06:31,612 --> 01:06:35,513
- You're boring a hole through that chicken.
- There's a coating on it.

1028
01:06:35,514 --> 01:06:38,076
- Is there a batter on it?
- Yes.

1029
01:06:38,077 --> 01:06:41,725
This is already seasoned,
but how are we going to cook it through?

1030
01:06:41,726 --> 01:06:45,223
- It's already cooked through.
- This is already cooked through?

1031
01:06:45,224 --> 01:06:48,729
- Yes, it's already cooked through.
- Seriously? I never knew that.

[Chef Joo Won dumps the chicken
without hesitation to the frying pan.]

1033

[Uses his right hand to pat it down...
and stirs it around with the left hand.]

[The skewers are frying away
for the Orange Team.]

1039
01:07:29,677 --> 01:07:32,112
I think it's almost done.
It's starting to get nice and crispy.

1040
01:07:32,113 --> 01:07:34,621
Let's try one at the end.

1041
01:07:36,177 --> 01:07:38,602
- We have to dip it in the sauce.
- This is done cooking, right?

1042
01:07:40,856 --> 01:07:45,038
- Should we add some water to this?
- No, why would we do that?

1043
01:07:47,236 --> 01:07:49,558
- I think it's going to be good.
- Taste it.

1044
01:07:52,622 --> 01:07:55,253
[Tastes the kebob...]

1045
01:07:56,959 --> 01:08:00,169
[He's laughing?
What could it taste like?]

1046
01:08:01,837 --> 01:08:03,790
It's really sweet.

1047
01:08:03,791 --> 01:08:06,699
The chocolate...
the chocolate's all I can smell.

1048
01:08:10,815 --> 01:08:13,037
All I can taste is the chocolate.

1049
01:08:13,925 --> 01:08:18,069
[Maybe the chocolate
wasn't our saving grace...]

1050
01:08:18,070 --> 01:08:19,951
I think the spaghetti sauce will be better.

1051
01:08:19,952 --> 01:08:22,831
Okay, I'll take care of the sauce,
so you finish this up.

1052
01:08:22,832 --> 01:08:25,376
We have to really speed it up.

1053
01:08:25,377 --> 01:08:28,699
- I can take care of that.
- I have to start frying the dumplings.

1054
01:08:29,354 --> 01:08:33,061
This is like a tight ball of muscles.
Look at that.

It's time to start frying them.]

1056

- It's falling apart.

[The spaghetti dumplings
are falling apart and losing shape.]

1060
01:09:13,861 --> 01:09:15,526
I was really shocked.

1061
01:09:15,527 --> 01:09:18,166
As soon as I bit into it,
it was just pure chocolate.

1062
01:09:19,152 --> 01:09:23,533
You can't taste the donkatsu
or the shrimp whatsoever.

1063
01:09:23,534 --> 01:09:26,603
- See? What did I tell you?
- It's just pure sweetness.

1064
01:09:27,525 --> 01:09:32,938
- We need something tart.
- I think tomato sauce would've been good.

1065
01:09:32,939 --> 01:09:36,377
Let's make the tomato sauce separately
and drizzle it on top.

1066
01:09:36,378 --> 01:09:39,288
[Meeting of the melted chocolate
and tart tomatoes?]

1067
01:09:39,289 --> 01:09:42,945
Yes, let's try it.
Tart and the sweet.

1068
01:09:42,946 --> 01:09:45,343
- Should we just mix it together?
- Let's just mix it.

1069
01:09:45,344 --> 01:09:47,455
Let's just mix the tomato sauce in there.

1070
01:09:51,557 --> 01:09:53,351
Just put a little bit
of the chocolate in here.

1071
01:09:53,352 --> 01:09:57,079
[Add in the melted chocolate
to the warm tomato sauce.]

1072
01:09:58,583 --> 01:10:03,345
[It'll definitely be less sweet
than the pure melted chocolate...]

1073

[Loyal chefs are sharing even
the small bits of the kebob together.]

1074

01:10:19,035 --> 01:10:21,887
No, I think...

1076
01:10:23,063 --> 01:10:27,015
You know the Indian curry?
That's what this tastes like.

1077
01:10:27,016 --> 01:10:29,572
How can it taste like that?
Let's mix it all in.

1078
01:10:29,573 --> 01:10:34,156
I can't believe how that tastes.
Try it, Ji Hyo.

1079
01:10:34,157 --> 01:10:37,562
- Seriously?
- Try it, it's no joke.

1080
01:10:37,563 --> 01:10:40,523
[It was so sweet before,
so how can it taste like that?]

1081
01:10:40,524 --> 01:10:43,884
- This is how they make their curry sauce.
- Oh my.

1082
01:10:43,885 --> 01:10:47,060
- Doesn't it taste like that?
- It's really good.

1083

- Cook it down.

[Crispy rice is also starting to take shape.]

1088

[The sound of their love and effort.]

1090
01:11:21,878 --> 01:11:24,422
I need to flip this over.

1091

[Time to add in Chef Yoo's secret sauce.]

1095

[Adds in another huge dollop of the sauce.]

1097
01:11:52,370 --> 01:11:54,218
Should we add the noodles right now?

1098
01:11:56,850 --> 01:11:59,966
- It's like spicy chicken wings.
- Not exactly what I was thinking.

1099
01:11:59,967 --> 01:12:03,258
[Is spicy chicken wings
what we were going for?]

1100
01:12:03,259 --> 01:12:06,972
I think this is going to be too salty.
Should we add in some water?

1101
01:12:09,265 --> 01:12:13,088
[Dumps in the rest of the secret sauce.
Starting to look a bit salty...]

1102

Add in the dumplings.

[Dumps in the whole bowl of the dumplings.]

1104
01:12:21,781 --> 01:12:25,574
- We have to add the noodles too.
- No, we have to add the vegetables.

1105
01:12:27,844 --> 01:12:31,038
You're going to dump the whole thing?
No, that's too much!

1106

[Add it all in!
We are all as one!]

1107

- Is that spicy chicken stew?

1108
01:12:40,076 --> 01:12:42,786
Is that like stir-fried chitlins?

Oil?
No, add the water.

as their finishing touch.]

1131
01:14:23,741 --> 01:14:26,861
- You have to plate it and bring it over.
- Okay.

1132
01:14:31,407 --> 01:14:33,467
It's good.
Try it.

1133
01:14:36,037 --> 01:14:37,983
We're going to start the judging.

1134
01:14:37,984 --> 01:14:41,850
- It's really good.
- It's really good all of a sudden.

1135
01:14:43,375 --> 01:14:45,480
[Chef Joo Won's turn to give it a taste.]

1136
01:14:45,481 --> 01:14:47,520
Wow, what is this?

1137
01:14:47,521 --> 01:14:49,575
Isn't it good?

1138
01:14:49,576 --> 01:14:52,360
- How did that happen?
- It's really good.

1139
01:14:52,361 --> 01:14:55,691
- What are you guys doing over there?
- We're going to be here all night.

1140
01:14:55,692 --> 01:14:57,739
Pour some water in there.

1141
01:14:57,740 --> 01:15:01,471
[Add the crispy rice on top.]

1142
01:15:01,472 --> 01:15:06,313
[Since they're already adding in everything,
another dump of water...]

1143
01:15:08,496 --> 01:15:11,957
[Confidently walks out with their dish.]

1144
01:15:11,958 --> 01:15:14,328
Shake it up a bit to mix it together.

1145
01:15:14,329 --> 01:15:17,640
[Shake it all up to improve the taste?]

1146
01:15:17,641 --> 01:15:20,361
It just needs to taste good.

1147
01:15:21,175 --> 01:15:23,341
What is that?
Pig gruel?

1148
01:15:26,253 --> 01:15:29,343
[DIY Cooking Battle- Complete.]

1149
01:15:29,975 --> 01:15:32,031
[Time for the judges to come in.]

1150
01:15:32,032 --> 01:15:36,596
These dishes were created solely by using
instant and frozen ingredients.

1151
01:15:37,318 --> 01:15:40,139
It wasn't intentional,
but we came up with a killer sauce.

1152
01:15:40,140 --> 01:15:43,957
-We also came up with an amazing sauce.
- We truly have the best sauce out of all.

1153
01:15:44,735 --> 01:15:47,202
Why did you add in that water
at the last minute?

1154
01:15:47,203 --> 01:15:50,117
It made it even better.
It tastes even better now.

1155
01:15:50,118 --> 01:15:52,006
[Last minute addition of the water
made the dish even better.]

1156
01:15:52,007 --> 01:15:57,135
We will now welcome our panel of judges
who'll help us judge our dishes.

1157
01:15:57,136 --> 01:16:00,183
[Time to introduce the panel of judges.]

1158
01:16:00,878 --> 01:16:05,234
The newest internet foodie sensation,
Mr. Kim Dong Bum.

1159
01:16:08,156 --> 01:16:11,118
- You look like a real foodie.
- He's very famous.

1160
01:16:12,496 --> 01:16:15,052
The woman seated next to him

1161
01:16:15,053 --> 01:16:18,660
is Ms. Lee Sang Hee,
an internet food blogging sensation.

1162
01:16:20,031 --> 01:16:22,417
I love your blogs!

1163
01:16:22,418 --> 01:16:25,052
- You're so pretty, Lee Sang Hee!
- Gary says you're cute.

1164
01:16:25,634 --> 01:16:33,154
The man seated in the middle is the star of
food for the single men blog, Wui Lee Geun.

1165
01:16:33,189 --> 01:16:35,796
Mr. Wui Lee Geun!

1166
01:16:35,797 --> 01:16:39,708
[Representative single man of the country
specializing in tips for all the single men.]

1167
01:16:39,709 --> 01:16:44,518
Then we have self-acclaimed foodie,
cartoonist, Kim Poong.

1168
01:16:44,519 --> 01:16:47,328
[Self-acclaimed foodie, Kim Poong.]

1169
01:16:47,329 --> 01:16:54,597
And lastly, SBS' very own foodie and
bachelor, PD Kim Joo Hyung, aka PD Myuk.

1170
01:16:56,165 --> 01:16:59,891
- No, he's not a foodie.
- How is he a foodie?

1171
01:16:59,892 --> 01:17:01,672
No, he's not a foodie.

1172
01:17:01,673 --> 01:17:06,938
These five judges will fairly judge
the dishes that you've created.

1173
01:17:06,939 --> 01:17:12,081
After tasting the dishes you've created,
they'll give you a star rating.

1174
01:17:12,082 --> 01:17:15,133
Five stars will mean a perfect score.
Is that understood?

1175
01:17:15,168 --> 01:17:20,372
You can decide amongst yourselves
who'll be the first to be judged.

1176
01:17:20,373 --> 01:17:25,221
Can the judges tell us
what they're looking for?

1177
01:17:25,222 --> 01:17:29,105
- Is it the quantity of food?
- No, I'll be looking for quality.

1178
01:17:29,795 --> 01:17:32,940
- Do you like salty foods?
- Yes, I tend to like saltier foods.

1179
01:17:34,578 --> 01:17:38,319
[Yes! Kim Dong Bum
with the salty taste buds!]

1180
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:41,924
We have our faith in you.
What about you, Ms. Lee Sang Hee?

1181
01:17:41,925 --> 01:17:47,748
I prefer simple dishes that are made
with very simple ingredients.

1182
01:17:47,749 --> 01:17:50,950
- No need to worry.
- This was made very simply.

1183
01:17:50,951 --> 01:17:54,584
Then who'd like to go first?
Ji Hyo, would you like to go first?

1184
01:17:54,585 --> 01:17:56,224
[Orange Team is first to be judged.]

1185
01:17:57,231 --> 01:18:01,763
- What we were going for was...
- Our dish is called, 'Crazy po-imp rollup.'

1186
01:18:02,560 --> 01:18:04,384
'Crazy po-imp rollup.'

1187
01:18:05,167 --> 01:18:08,095
It's a crazy rollup of pork and shrimp.

1188
01:18:08,096 --> 01:18:10,822
[Pork cutlet donkatsu and shrimp skewers
rolled up in spaghetti noodles.]

1189
01:18:11,447 --> 01:18:15,200
[Not the best looking expression
on the judges faces.]

1190
01:18:15,705 --> 01:18:18,369
We had no idea that we'd be able to
create a sauce like that either.

1191
01:18:18,370 --> 01:18:21,403
It's a fusion of spaghetti sauce
with melted chocolate.

1192
01:18:21,404 --> 01:18:26,593
- But it's unexpectedly good.
- It turned out unbelievably well.

1193
01:18:26,628 --> 01:18:32,223
- We hope you'll enjoy it.
- It tastes like Indian curry.

1194
01:18:32,224 --> 01:18:36,261
We ask that you dip the kebob
in the sauce and enjoy it together.

1195
01:18:36,262 --> 01:18:38,853
We stand behind our sauce.

1196
01:18:40,131 --> 01:18:43,443
- Why don't you do it, Ji Hyo?
- They should dip it themselves.

1197
01:18:43,444 --> 01:18:45,816
No, we were going to drizzle it on top.

1198
01:18:48,056 --> 01:18:51,379
- Don't drizzle too much on top.
- This isn't salty at all.

1199
01:18:51,380 --> 01:18:56,499
- You'll be amazed by the taste.
- Ladies first.

1200
01:18:57,625 --> 01:18:59,550
This is making me feel nervous.

1201
01:18:59,551 --> 01:19:01,848
[Time to taste the dish.]

1202
01:19:01,849 --> 01:19:05,567
- You're really going to like this.
- It really tastes like Indian curry.

1203
01:19:06,307 --> 01:19:08,483
- You'll taste all the ingredients.
- It smells pretty good, doesn't it?

1204
01:19:08,484 --> 01:19:10,467
- It smells very good.
- Doesn't it?

1205
01:19:11,693 --> 01:19:15,960
- Since this is a fusion dish...
- We went for the flavors of India.

1206
01:19:17,019 --> 01:19:19,534
Dong Bum looks afraid to try it.

1207
01:19:19,535 --> 01:19:24,192
- Since this is a fashion dish...
- Dong Bum looks afraid to try it.

1208
01:19:25,271 --> 01:19:28,280
[Much tougher to slide it off the skewer
than it looks.]

1209
01:19:30,627 --> 01:19:34,291
[The judges are engaged in a battle
with the wooden skewers.]

1210
01:19:34,292 --> 01:19:36,795
Are you alright?

1211
01:19:39,294 --> 01:19:43,413
[The kebobs are turning into a total mess.]

1212
01:19:48,682 --> 01:19:51,600
[Is this why they call it a crazy rollup?]

1213
01:19:56,471 --> 01:20:00,620
[Takes a sauce shower at the judging table.]

1214
01:20:01,778 --> 01:20:03,753
We didn't realize it would be like that.

1215
01:20:03,754 --> 01:20:06,642
- Is it that tough?
- It wasn't like this earlier.

1216
01:20:12,005 --> 01:20:14,717
You didn't tie it up with a rope, did you?

1217
01:20:14,718 --> 01:20:19,291
I have strong teeth,
but that was still very difficult.

1218
01:20:19,292 --> 01:20:21,921
It's not easy to eat,
but the sauce really is delicious.

1219
01:20:21,922 --> 01:20:25,801
- It's just been sitting for a bit...
- Please be lenient in that retrospect.

1220
01:20:25,802 --> 01:20:28,810
What do you think?

1221
01:20:28,811 --> 01:20:31,489
I personally liked it.

1222
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:36,160
I personally like dishes like this.

1223
01:20:38,735 --> 01:20:41,696
I also like your experimental
attitude towards food.

1224
01:20:41,697 --> 01:20:46,035
- If we had more time...
- I really liked that about this dish.

1225
01:20:46,036 --> 01:20:49,511
How about our resident foodie, PD Myuk?

1226
01:20:49,512 --> 01:20:53,099
Foods that are visually pleasing
are pleasing to the stomach as well.

1227
01:20:53,100 --> 01:20:57,305
I really liked how visually pleasing this is,
and it's nice in that aspect.

1228
01:20:57,306 --> 01:20:59,787
But with it being so tough to eat

1229
01:20:59,788 --> 01:21:03,779
I feel like this is something you serve to
someone whom you have a grudge against.

1230
01:21:06,154 --> 01:21:09,666
[A very crude way of explaining.]

1231
01:21:09,667 --> 01:21:13,333
That was a very different way
of explaining your experience.

1232
01:21:15,581 --> 01:21:20,067
[That's our PD Myuk!
Hands automatically go out to his throat.]

1233
01:21:20,068 --> 01:21:22,819
He definitely is very crude.

1234
01:21:24,175 --> 01:21:28,381
But please take the effort it took
into your consideration.

1235
01:21:28,382 --> 01:21:30,945
[Orange Team's judging is now complete.]

1236
01:21:35,046 --> 01:21:37,747
[Time for Green Team's judging.]

1237
01:21:40,027 --> 01:21:44,078
The name of our dish is...

1238
01:21:44,079 --> 01:21:49,069
'Three beats into the rhythm!'

1239
01:21:49,723 --> 01:21:52,267
[A nice name for the tri colored dumplings.]

1240
01:21:52,268 --> 01:21:57,564
We used chicken as the ingredient
for one of the dumplings

1241
01:21:57,565 --> 01:22:01,237
and steak with some onions and
rice cakes.

1242
01:22:01,272 --> 01:22:04,287
Don't you think that you're using
too many technical culinary terms?

1243
01:22:04,288 --> 01:22:07,666
[Three different dumplings made up of
various different ingredients.]

1244
01:22:09,767 --> 01:22:12,787
[Even serves the dishes personally.]

1245
01:22:15,533 --> 01:22:17,394
I see, thank you.

1246
01:22:20,821 --> 01:22:23,929
- It's a nice bite size.
- Yes, a single bite size.

1247
01:22:30,006 --> 01:22:36,086
- The rice cakes compliments it nicely.
- It's a different judging from the last.

1248
01:22:36,087 --> 01:22:38,455
Everyone looks so much more relaxed.

1249
01:22:40,187 --> 01:22:42,988
- He wiped his plate clean.
- He ate it all.

1250
01:22:42,989 --> 01:22:45,287
That's because you served them tiny bites.

1251
01:22:45,288 --> 01:22:49,717
- I was trying to serve them.
- They were really tiny bites.

1252
01:22:50,811 --> 01:22:55,023
I don't know if it's because I was so
scarred by the first dish...

1253
01:22:55,611 --> 01:22:57,947
No, it wasn't that bad.

1254
01:22:57,948 --> 01:23:01,443
I think the dish is a great idea.

1255
01:23:01,444 --> 01:23:04,991
But the taste is a bit like
street vendor food style.

1256
01:23:04,992 --> 01:23:07,707
That's because we used rice cake sauce.

1257
01:23:08,455 --> 01:23:13,851
They all pretty much tastes the same.
They all have a sweet taste to it.

1258
01:23:14,502 --> 01:23:18,612
If something is sweet,
then there should be something salty.

1259
01:23:18,613 --> 01:23:24,884
I know that you added the red pepper paste
to the pasta sauce, but you can't taste it.

1260
01:23:24,885 --> 01:23:27,893
Yes, it needs to taste a little salty.

1261
01:23:30,421 --> 01:23:33,128
We're bring that out to you.
We'll bring the salty and the sweet.

1262
01:23:34,933 --> 01:23:38,121
I really want to praise you
on your presentation.

1263
01:23:39,025 --> 01:23:46,259
You can't help but think 'cheap' when
it's made with these types of ingredients

1264
01:23:46,260 --> 01:23:49,101
but there's an aura of elegance
to your dish.

1265
01:23:50,507 --> 01:23:55,253
But I personally am not a fan of
carbonara sauce.

1266
01:23:56,884 --> 01:24:00,627
[What great news to these people!]

1267
01:24:00,628 --> 01:24:04,595
- He doesn't like carbonara sauce.
- We had very limited ingredients.

1268
01:24:04,596 --> 01:24:08,251
But I think that women would like
these flavors.

1269
01:24:08,252 --> 01:24:14,905
I really like how it's plated,
and how easy these were to eat.

1270
01:24:14,906 --> 01:24:19,198
I especially liked the steak bite
with the cream sauce on top.

1271
01:24:19,199 --> 01:24:22,644
One thing I was disappointed by
was the plain rice cake.

1272
01:24:22,645 --> 01:24:25,906
I wonder if it would've been better
if you had fried it first.

1273
01:24:25,907 --> 01:24:30,318
- That's what I was thinking too!
- Yes, you guys should've fried it!

1274
01:24:37,423 --> 01:24:42,514
I really enjoy it when I can get
all the flavors together in one single bite.

1275
01:24:42,515 --> 01:24:46,011
The taste that can explode in your mouth
as you chew it all together.

1276
01:24:46,012 --> 01:24:47,939
So I really enjoyed that about this dish.

1277
01:24:50,169 --> 01:24:53,078
[Green Team's judging
finishes off on a very high note.]

1278
01:24:53,956 --> 01:24:57,197
We will bring up the rear with our dish.

1279
01:24:57,882 --> 01:25:00,566
I don't think you should have very high
expectations for this dish.

1280
01:25:00,567 --> 01:25:05,971
The thing we're disappointed by is that this
dish should be eaten while it's still hot.

1281
01:25:07,601 --> 01:25:10,502
The name of our dish is...

1282
01:25:10,503 --> 01:25:15,740
'Instant chicken wing, dumpling,
and noodle stir-fry.'

1283
01:25:16,553 --> 01:25:19,092
[That is one long name for the dish.]

1284
01:25:19,093 --> 01:25:22,633
Do you remember the street rice cakes
that you used to eat when you were young?

1285
01:25:22,634 --> 01:25:26,462
We tried to bring back that same taste
back from our childhood.

1286
01:25:26,463 --> 01:25:28,409
I'd like to be honest

1287
01:25:28,410 --> 01:25:32,547
and tell you that the dish is a bit salty
since the chicken itself was salty.

1288
01:25:32,548 --> 01:25:35,577
Yes, that's true but also with everyone so
into over-consumption of their food lately

1289
01:25:35,578 --> 01:25:40,289
we purposely made it a bit saltier
so that people won't over-eat as much.

1290
01:25:41,221 --> 01:25:44,780
Please understand that it's a bit salty
since we were upfront about that aspect.

1291
01:25:45,606 --> 01:25:48,165
Why don't you all give it a taste?

1292
01:25:48,166 --> 01:25:51,336
Please allow us to also wish you
the best of luck in the new year.

1293
01:25:51,337 --> 01:25:53,321
Best of luck in the new year.

1294
01:25:57,423 --> 01:26:01,015
[That's six months too late, you fool.]

1295
01:26:01,016 --> 01:26:03,531
We're closer to next year
than we are to last year.

1296
01:26:06,033 --> 01:26:08,974
Wasn't it swimming in the sauce before?

1297
01:26:11,133 --> 01:26:13,607
Don't pay them any attention.

1298
01:26:13,608 --> 01:26:15,743
[The presentation of the dish
has been changed.]

1299
01:26:18,955 --> 01:26:21,485
Why is he bent over that piece of chicken?

1300
01:26:23,637 --> 01:26:29,020
It's just a relief that our dish
wasn't the first one to be judged.

1301
01:26:32,086 --> 01:26:34,467
He's going for the water.

1302
01:26:41,387 --> 01:26:45,691
[They guessed this may happen,
so came prepared with the water.]

1303
01:26:45,692 --> 01:26:47,820
We brought you some extra water.

1304
01:26:50,575 --> 01:26:53,048
Just let us know if you need more water.

1305
01:26:55,881 --> 01:27:00,141
Did you three make the three components
of this dish separately?

1306
01:27:02,137 --> 01:27:06,028
[How the dish was even created
is a mystery in itself.]

1307
01:27:06,029 --> 01:27:08,745
It was a chicken wing stew.

1308
01:27:08,746 --> 01:27:12,887
[A mysterious dish that they're not sure
how it was even created.]

1309
01:27:12,888 --> 01:27:16,092
It's to represent how we are all as one
by mixing all the components together.

1310
01:27:16,093 --> 01:27:18,229
That's why we put everything
together in one pot.

1311
01:27:19,297 --> 01:27:24,397
After having tried it...
it tastes like you just winged it.

1312
01:27:26,448 --> 01:27:29,879
- Don't you think that you're being too harsh?
- No, I don't think so.

1313
01:27:29,880 --> 01:27:36,499
With the other dishes,
it didn't taste like instant food.

1314
01:27:36,500 --> 01:27:40,507
- You can tell with ours?
- Your dish is very obvious.

1315
01:27:40,508 --> 01:27:43,708
- That's just what we were going for.
- That's why our dish is called, 'instant'.

1316
01:27:43,709 --> 01:27:45,934
- Then we succeeded!
- Of course.

1317
01:27:45,935 --> 01:27:48,438
We purposely left that taste obvious.

1318
01:27:48,439 --> 01:27:52,024
Trying to mask the taste of instant food
is just lying.

1319
01:27:52,025 --> 01:27:56,145
It's a given that instant food
should maintain that instant food taste.

1320
01:27:56,146 --> 01:28:00,209
- What do you think?
- I think differently.

1321
01:28:02,296 --> 01:28:04,172
I'm different.

1322
01:28:04,173 --> 01:28:10,261
Trying to take instant food
and masking it as real food...

1323
01:28:11,395 --> 01:28:13,823
We weren't asking you!

1324
01:28:15,291 --> 01:28:17,654
[I haven't even gotten started.]

1325
01:28:17,655 --> 01:28:19,890
Stop eating!

1326
01:28:20,918 --> 01:28:24,838
When it comes to cooking,
everyone has their own style and method.

1327
01:28:24,839 --> 01:28:30,170
Whether it be dumpling or chicken.
But when it comes to chicken wings...

1328
01:28:30,171 --> 01:28:34,973
Many people don't get the chance
to eat something like this.

1329
01:28:34,974 --> 01:28:40,207
- So this is special in that sense.
- You should thank him for that comment.

1330
01:28:41,795 --> 01:28:45,769
The fact that you took such a
special ingredient and ruined it like this...

1331
01:28:47,589 --> 01:28:51,557
[A mixture of compliment and
disdain in his judging.]

1332
01:28:51,558 --> 01:28:56,261
The fact that you ruined it...
is an insult to the chickens.

1333
01:28:56,296 --> 01:28:58,361
I didn't think it was that bad.

1334
01:28:58,362 --> 01:29:00,877
What are your thoughts?

1335
01:29:00,878 --> 01:29:05,217
The best part during
the judging for me was...

1336
01:29:05,218 --> 01:29:07,891
when I got to take a drink of
my water.

1337
01:29:13,493 --> 01:29:15,512
That's why water is so precious.

1338
01:29:15,513 --> 01:29:19,201
[Cooking note- Water is precious.]

1339
01:29:19,202 --> 01:29:21,939
- That's why water is precious.
- There's a message in our dish.

1340
01:29:21,940 --> 01:29:26,335
I know that I've told you that instant food
should maintain some of its taste...

1341
01:29:26,336 --> 01:29:29,209
but I think you must've misunderstood
the point that I was trying to make.

1342
01:29:30,902 --> 01:29:34,490
[A huge misunderstanding on their part.]

1343
01:29:35,540 --> 01:29:41,272
- Can you tell us what you think?
- I purposely didn't eat before I came here.

1344
01:29:45,538 --> 01:29:49,301
I think I just filled up on water
during this judging process.

1345
01:29:49,302 --> 01:29:53,387
I'm disappointed that I had to
fill up on water like this.

1346
01:29:53,388 --> 01:29:57,106
I personally really like chicken.

1347
01:29:57,107 --> 01:30:00,439
Because chicken tastes good
no matter what you do to it.

1348
01:30:03,819 --> 01:30:09,144
[Just what have you done to the chicken?]

1349
01:30:09,145 --> 01:30:12,582
- You shouldn't be so biased like that.
- Why does chicken have to be always good?

1350
01:30:12,583 --> 01:30:15,809
As much as we work at it,
the chicken has to put in some efforts too.

1351
01:30:15,810 --> 01:30:17,596
[Cooking lesson-
Chicken has to work at it too.]

1352
01:30:17,597 --> 01:30:19,288
My point is that the chicken
has to work at it too.

1353
01:30:19,289 --> 01:30:22,126
I actually had the highest expectation
for your dish when I saw it

1354
01:30:22,127 --> 01:30:24,250
because I have such an affinity
for chicken.

1355
01:30:24,251 --> 01:30:29,413
- But as high as my expectations were...
- Your expectations were too high.

1356
01:30:29,414 --> 01:30:31,600
Your expectations were too high.

1357
01:30:32,434 --> 01:30:35,238
[Sorry for having high expectations.]

1358
01:30:35,239 --> 01:30:37,501
We had no idea that
you liked chicken so much.

1359
01:30:37,502 --> 01:30:40,798
But I still have hope after
these comments.

1360
01:30:40,799 --> 01:30:43,271
We are all of the same opinion right now.

1361
01:30:43,926 --> 01:30:46,810
[We are as one!]

1362
01:30:46,811 --> 01:30:50,202
We are what bound all four
of their opinions as one.

1363
01:30:50,203 --> 01:30:52,729
- This is what we were going for.
- Yes, that's true.

1364
01:30:52,730 --> 01:30:56,601
Then it's now time to make the judgment.

1365
01:30:56,602 --> 01:30:59,820
The judges are now going to take the time
to score your dishes.

1366
01:30:59,821 --> 01:31:05,113
I'd like to mention again that this
this got so tough because it got cold.

1367
01:31:05,114 --> 01:31:12,834
I think it would be best to give one score
after discussing it amongst ourselves first.

1368
01:31:18,542 --> 01:31:24,689
[Very serious looking expression
on these judges faces.]

1369
01:31:27,245 --> 01:31:28,954
Ours are very similar.

1370
01:31:32,148 --> 01:31:35,816
[Who will be chosen to have
created the best tasting dish?]

1371
01:31:35,817 --> 01:31:39,761
The judging process is now complete.

1372
01:31:39,762 --> 01:31:42,152
We're very nervous to hear the results.

1373
01:31:42,153 --> 01:31:46,154
I get the feeling that it's either
going to be Green or the Orange Team.

1374
01:31:46,155 --> 01:31:50,495
We will now reveal your scores.

1375
01:31:58,508 --> 01:32:00,340
Are you going to put on those helmets?

1376
01:32:00,341 --> 01:32:03,583
Isn't that too much work?

1377
01:32:03,584 --> 01:32:07,679
That's going a little overboard.

1378
01:32:08,143 --> 01:32:10,550
[Time for the judges to put their helmets on.]

1379
01:32:10,551 --> 01:32:13,512
This is the first time I'm getting to
use something like this.

1380
01:32:15,684 --> 01:32:19,827
Everyone seems okay with it.
We'll get started with our team first.

1381
01:32:19,828 --> 01:32:23,922
- Five stars would mean a perfect score.
- Let's see how many stars gets lit up.

1382
01:32:23,923 --> 01:32:29,144
Okay, for the Blue Team.
One, two, three!

1383
01:32:30,010 --> 01:32:35,043
[The ever so controversial chicken dish...]

1384
01:32:40,015 --> 01:32:41,415
One!

1385
01:32:45,240 --> 01:32:47,596
There you go!

1386
01:32:52,969 --> 01:33:00,016
[Even though it may not have been the best,
it still carried a good message...]

1387
01:33:00,017 --> 01:33:02,953
[That's it!]

1388
01:33:03,448 --> 01:33:05,809
[Blue Team- Two stars.]

1389
01:33:05,810 --> 01:33:09,145
Two stars isn't bad at all.

1390
01:33:09,146 --> 01:33:11,771
That's more than what I was expecting.

1391
01:33:11,772 --> 01:33:16,371
- Two stars is very respectable.
- Yes, I agree.

1392
01:33:16,372 --> 01:33:20,374
Next up is, Hong Suk Chun,
Ha Ha and Kim Jong Kook.

1393
01:33:21,417 --> 01:33:25,317
Let's see how many stars they can score
and if they can beat our two stars.

1394
01:33:31,295 --> 01:33:33,099
Nice, thank you.

1395
01:33:43,215 --> 01:33:45,099
Will three stars be it?

1396
01:33:46,275 --> 01:33:48,035
[There it is!]

1397
01:33:53,532 --> 01:33:55,563
Just give us half.

1398
01:34:00,668 --> 01:34:02,730
One, two, three!

1399
01:34:02,731 --> 01:34:04,618
[Half more, and it'll be a perfect score!]

1400
01:34:05,889 --> 01:34:11,600
[Green Team's dish that was unique
even with their name!]

1401
01:34:11,601 --> 01:34:20,637
['Three beats into the rhythm' has garnered
positive reviews from all the judges.]

1402
01:34:23,346 --> 01:34:29,452
[Will they be able to earn five stars?]

1403
01:34:36,499 --> 01:34:39,963
[But Green Team still earns
four and a half stars!]

1404
01:34:39,964 --> 01:34:42,264
- So we need to get five stars?
- We win if we get five stars?

1405
01:34:42,265 --> 01:34:44,622
- We still have a chance.
- Five stars and you win.

1406
01:34:44,623 --> 01:34:46,878
So we still have a chance.

1407
01:34:46,879 --> 01:34:49,707
Ji Suk Jin, Gary, and Blank Ji Hyo.
Time to see their score.

1408
01:34:49,708 --> 01:34:53,355
They need to get five stars to
beat the Green Team's four and a half stars.

1409
01:34:58,725 --> 01:35:03,479
One, two...
they're tied with our score for now.

1410
01:35:04,801 --> 01:35:07,911
[Blue Team is guaranteed the last spot.]

1411
01:35:07,912 --> 01:35:10,231
- Come on.
- Keep going!

1412
01:35:18,684 --> 01:35:19,883
A full star.

1413
01:35:25,295 --> 01:35:26,909
Okay, PD Myuk.

1414
01:35:27,648 --> 01:35:30,514
[They'll be tied for first place
if PD Myuk gives them half a star.]

1415
01:35:30,515 --> 01:35:32,799
One, two, three!

five esteemed panel of judges for
