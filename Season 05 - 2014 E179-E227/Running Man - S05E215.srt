1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,950
Running Man

2
00:00:01,953 --> 00:00:04,797
[Gangnam, Seoul- 'R' Art Center.]

3
00:00:05,658 --> 00:00:08,996
[October, in the midst of crisp fall air.]

4
00:00:12,594 --> 00:00:18,849
[The most beautiful bride in the world.]

5
00:00:23,764 --> 00:00:33,033
[And... the man waiting for his bride.]

6
00:00:40,065 --> 00:00:44,119
Are you here for a gang fight
or something?

7
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:46,138
Can't you sit more elegantly?

8
00:00:46,139 --> 00:00:49,070
Can't you tell that we're here for
a wedding just from a single glance?

9
00:00:49,071 --> 00:00:52,080
[Family of the Bride- Family of the Groom.]

10
00:00:52,081 --> 00:00:56,315
- Intimidation is a given in this meeting.
- This is why I oppose this marriage.

11
00:00:56,316 --> 00:00:59,421
Who sits like this at a first family meeting?

12
00:00:59,422 --> 00:01:03,211
You were lucky enough to be accepted,
so you need to bow down to us!

13
00:01:03,811 --> 00:01:07,343
You're making a big mistake. You're
being too rough at our first meeting.

14
00:01:07,344 --> 00:01:10,414
You look like you're
the elder of the family.

15
00:01:11,292 --> 00:01:13,392
He's our great grandfather.

16
00:01:15,824 --> 00:01:17,832
[There's an empty seat
on the groom's side.]

17
00:01:17,833 --> 00:01:20,813
- Don't you have any manners?
- Can't your family be more punctual?

18
00:01:20,814 --> 00:01:23,290
This is the first time
I've opposed a marriage

19
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:26,602
from disliking
the groom's family so much.

20
00:01:26,637 --> 00:01:28,635
He talks so much!

21
00:01:28,636 --> 00:01:31,204
[Just then...]

22
00:01:33,859 --> 00:01:37,377
[One man walks into the meeting room.]

23
00:01:37,378 --> 00:01:41,672
This is the first meeting
of the two families.

24
00:01:49,547 --> 00:01:51,539
It's Jung Suk!

25
00:01:54,102 --> 00:01:57,411
[Warm and caring, Jo Jung Suk is here!]

26
00:01:58,928 --> 00:02:02,266
[Unbelievable charisma
on the musical stage.]

27
00:02:02,924 --> 00:02:06,106
[Showing off his amazing acting talent
in the movie, 'Architecture 101.']

28
00:02:06,107 --> 00:02:10,841
[Man on fire, Jo Jung Suk, who's captured
both the stage and silver screen.]

29
00:02:12,909 --> 00:02:16,527
[Welcome!]

30
00:02:18,827 --> 00:02:22,774
[The groom's family's confidence level
goes up with Jo Jung Suk's appearance.]

31
00:02:22,775 --> 00:02:25,823
- Come here, Kwang Soo.
- Jung Suk!

32
00:02:28,237 --> 00:02:31,824
[The look of a happy groom-to-be.]

33
00:02:31,825 --> 00:02:34,896
- I've always wanted to meet you.
- Don't you know what his name is?

34
00:02:35,951 --> 00:02:38,201
[Jung Suk sits down in the empty seat
on the groom's side.]

35
00:02:38,202 --> 00:02:41,916
Then who's seat is that?
Isn't that supposed to be the groom's seat?

36
00:02:41,917 --> 00:02:44,701
[The groom and the bride's chair
still remains empty.]

37
00:02:44,702 --> 00:02:47,361
- Isn't the groom supposed to sit there?
- Are you not the groom?

38
00:02:47,362 --> 00:02:49,061
[Jung Suk isn't the groom?]

39
00:02:50,521 --> 00:02:54,968
[In the meantime, the October bride...]

40
00:02:56,030 --> 00:03:01,233
[She starts to make her way
down to the room.]

41
00:03:01,234 --> 00:03:04,538
- I wonder who the bride is.
- You're not the groom?

42
00:03:04,539 --> 00:03:06,469
- Here she comes!
- Who is she?

43
00:03:12,501 --> 00:03:15,982
[The bride is seen walking over
behind the filmy white curtain.]

44
00:03:16,694 --> 00:03:18,864
[Everyone in the room breaks out
in an excited chatter.]

45
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:20,378
She's pretty even from a quick glance.

46
00:03:20,379 --> 00:03:23,321
[The beautiful silhouette of the bride...]

47
00:03:24,105 --> 00:03:27,522
[It's time to meet the bride.]

48
00:03:30,004 --> 00:03:31,838
- Is she pretty?
- She's a member of our family.

49
00:03:31,839 --> 00:03:38,692
[The October bride is... Shin Min Ah.]

50
00:03:41,685 --> 00:03:47,225
[This isn't a dream, is it?]

51
00:03:48,741 --> 00:03:51,352
- She's our family member.
- The youngest member of our family.

52
00:03:51,353 --> 00:03:59,624
[Shin Min Ah is standing in front
of my own very two eyes.]

53
00:03:59,625 --> 00:04:02,088
Wow, it's Shin Min Ah!

54
00:04:02,089 --> 00:04:03,432
[Giraffe can't even manage to
look Min Ah in the eyes.]

55
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:09,783
[Today is this blushing bride's
wedding day.]

56
00:04:09,784 --> 00:04:12,700
- Come here, what are you doing over there?
- Come back here.

57
00:04:12,701 --> 00:04:14,428
[Can't even come near her presence.]

58
00:04:14,429 --> 00:04:17,785
- She's a member of our family?
- She looks like a porcelain doll.

59
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:21,854
- Min Ah is so pretty!
- You look like a doll just sitting there.

60
00:04:21,855 --> 00:04:24,780
- Say something.
- There you go wagging your tail again.

61
00:04:25,961 --> 00:04:29,238
- Can you please say something?
- I feel so awkward.

62
00:04:29,239 --> 00:04:31,465
I feel so awkward.

63
00:04:31,466 --> 00:04:35,819
[Everyone's so excited at
hearing Min Ah's first words.]

64
00:04:36,683 --> 00:04:39,914
- Jae Suk, you go first.
- What is this?

65
00:04:39,915 --> 00:04:43,166
[Find out your relation to the bride and the
groom by peeling back the name plague.]

66
00:04:43,167 --> 00:04:45,930
I'm the bride's older brother, too.

67
00:04:45,931 --> 00:04:49,214
- First and second oldest brother?
- I'm the bride's older sister.

68
00:04:49,215 --> 00:04:50,887
I wonder if I'm the bride's little brother.

69
00:04:50,888 --> 00:04:53,096
I'm her fraternal twin brother!

70
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:56,461
[Min Ah bursts out in laughter.]

71
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:58,968
That's just absurd!

72
00:05:00,196 --> 00:05:03,307
- I'm her twin brother!
- How can that be? That's just absurd!

73
00:05:03,308 --> 00:05:05,936
That's just ridiculous.

74
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,947
- I'm the groom's older brother.
- What a relief! He's not the groom!

75
00:05:10,991 --> 00:05:14,535
- Ugh, what a relief.
- Groom's distant cousin-in-law.

76
00:05:14,536 --> 00:05:16,543
What the heck is that?

77
00:05:16,896 --> 00:05:18,848
[I guess he's not the groom.]

78
00:05:18,849 --> 00:05:22,027
- One of you must be the groom.
- I want to be the groom!

79
00:05:22,028 --> 00:05:23,441
[Then could that mean that either
Ha Ha or Gary is the groom?]

80
00:05:23,442 --> 00:05:26,611
- I can't believe this.
- Can it please be me?

81
00:05:27,179 --> 00:05:29,391
[Tear off the name simultaneously.]

82
00:05:30,604 --> 00:05:33,521
[Gary- Groom.]

83
00:05:36,634 --> 00:05:40,487
[Min Ah's love is Husband Gae.]

84
00:05:40,488 --> 00:05:43,247
- Can he even handle that?
- Is it really me?

85
00:05:44,072 --> 00:05:48,362
- You're the groom getting married?
- I'm so jealous!

86
00:05:48,397 --> 00:05:51,206
- Are you throwing Ji Hyo aside?
- Who's Ji Hyo?

87
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:53,664
Ji Ho?

88
00:05:55,458 --> 00:05:59,378
- I don't really remember that name.
- He's marrying Ji Hyo's younger sister.

89
00:06:01,076 --> 00:06:04,899
[We're going to be married soon!]

90
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:08,970
I'm sorry to say this...
but we oppose this marriage.

91
00:06:08,971 --> 00:06:12,482
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- You're opposing their marriage?

92
00:06:12,483 --> 00:06:15,897
- We're sorry!
- We don't like being forced into a marriage.

93
00:06:16,328 --> 00:06:19,008
What do you mean, forced?
We're not being forced into anything!

94
00:06:19,009 --> 00:06:20,966
- I don't like it either.
- Excuse me?

95
00:06:20,967 --> 00:06:22,772
- I just don't like it either.
- What is it that you don't like?

96
00:06:22,773 --> 00:06:25,586
Why are you in love with the woman
that I'm about to marry?

97
00:06:25,587 --> 00:06:28,015
- I'm not sure why, but...
- How can you do this to your own family?

98
00:06:28,016 --> 00:06:30,710
Jo Sung...
Jo Jung Suk...

99
00:06:31,228 --> 00:06:34,833
[It's understandable that he doesn't know
his name with it being the first meeting...]

100
00:06:34,834 --> 00:06:38,409
Jung Suk can read people's faces, right?
Why don't you read her face?

101
00:06:39,282 --> 00:06:44,466
- I don't think she likes our family.
- No, that's not true. I do like you.

102
00:06:48,777 --> 00:06:51,497
Gary's blushing for real right now.

103
00:06:51,498 --> 00:06:54,647
It would be the end for Kang Gary
if I were to open my mouth right now.

104
00:06:54,648 --> 00:06:56,343
No, stop!

105
00:06:56,948 --> 00:07:00,801
I don't want to see my sister getting hurt,
and that's why I oppose this marriage.

106
00:07:00,802 --> 00:07:03,318
I'm sure you all know why
we oppose this marriage.

107
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:05,640
Even though she is my own twin sister...

108
00:07:06,183 --> 00:07:08,423
I'm still in love with her.

109
00:07:10,987 --> 00:07:13,493
- What are you saying?
- I'm in love with my own twin sister.

110
00:07:15,586 --> 00:07:18,176
He needs to have some sense
beaten into him.

111
00:07:18,177 --> 00:07:22,182
Do you think it's possible to be marrying
her instead of marrying her older sister?

112
00:07:22,183 --> 00:07:24,955
He's marrying her because her
older sister won't marry him.

113
00:07:24,956 --> 00:07:26,924
[Will they be able to marry?]

114
00:07:26,925 --> 00:07:29,037
This is all because our family
is just too darned attractive.

115
00:07:29,517 --> 00:07:32,408
- What is that? A menu?
- Thank you.

116
00:07:32,899 --> 00:07:34,783
Listen very carefully.

117
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:41,859
- You've seen that from foreign films, right?
- What is he doing?

118
00:07:42,465 --> 00:07:47,216
[Wedding consent name tag elimination.]

119
00:07:47,217 --> 00:07:49,791
The bride and the groom must eliminate
everyone's name tags from both families

120
00:07:49,792 --> 00:07:52,913
in order to gain consent from everyone
of their marriage within given time limit.

121
00:07:53,318 --> 00:07:55,191
They need to eliminate any opposition.

122
00:07:55,192 --> 00:07:58,661
Once all name tags are eliminated, shout out,
'We're getting married' in front of

123
00:07:58,662 --> 00:08:01,040
the officiant in order to
successfully marry each other.

124
00:08:01,041 --> 00:08:02,457
Are they getting married for real?

125
00:08:02,458 --> 00:08:05,910
If they fail to eliminate all name tags and
are unable to get married

126
00:08:05,911 --> 00:08:10,631
then the groom can be swapped out for
someone else from the surviving family.

127
00:08:13,373 --> 00:08:17,286
- I vow to remain alive in this game.
- I'm going to run away to Namyang district.

128
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:24,108
The game will start at the count of ten
by the bride and the groom.

129
00:08:24,109 --> 00:08:26,003
- We're starting already?
- Right from here?

130
00:08:26,004 --> 00:08:29,396
- We're getting started from here?
- I have to eliminate those guys?

131
00:08:29,746 --> 00:08:32,978
- They can't eliminate us, can they?
- One, two...

132
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:36,346
['Please allow us to get married.'-
Family name tag elimination game- Start.]

133
00:08:37,102 --> 00:08:39,039
Get out of my way!

134
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,738
[Min Ah's twin brother, Giraffe,
takes off in a flash.]

135
00:08:40,739 --> 00:08:43,508
Seven, eight, nine, ten!

136
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:47,236
[Min Ah and Gary also get on their way.]

137
00:08:48,493 --> 00:08:50,569
Get out of my way!

138
00:08:53,951 --> 00:08:57,575
[Min Ah's oldest brother, Big-nose,
hides under the table.]

139
00:08:59,302 --> 00:09:02,112
- Do you have a lighter?
- No, I don't.

140
00:09:02,113 --> 00:09:04,553
You don't have a lighter? Then the
camera can't capture me right now?

141
00:09:04,554 --> 00:09:07,282
I can marry Shin Min Ah if
I can survive the next thirty minutes.

142
00:09:08,633 --> 00:09:11,353
[Haroro hides out by lying down on
the second floor balcony.]

143
00:09:15,558 --> 00:09:19,176
[Jung Suk hides out in the parking garage.]

144
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:23,311
I didn't finish what I was saying earlier,
but I definitely oppose this marriage.

145
00:09:23,878 --> 00:09:27,710
I feel like I'm the one that the bride
is meant to marry.

146
00:09:27,711 --> 00:09:33,535
'Face reading to know how women feel.
Face reading to know her virtue.'

147
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:36,752
You can look up the meaning of
that phrase yourself.

148
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:41,668
I want to get married, too.

149
00:09:41,669 --> 00:09:43,154
[I want to get married, too...]

150
00:09:43,155 --> 00:09:46,111
How should we do this?
What's that around your neck?

151
00:09:46,426 --> 00:09:49,960
- It's a fan.
- You are so darn cute!

152
00:09:49,995 --> 00:09:53,082
- I think we need to come up with a plan.
- A plan?

153
00:09:53,083 --> 00:09:55,760
You can hold them down,
and I'll rip off their name tags.

154
00:09:55,761 --> 00:10:00,073
Okay, I'll turn their backs towards you,
or even if I'm in front of you like this

155
00:10:00,074 --> 00:10:04,898
just reach around with your arm, and do it.
Here, let's practice how we'll do it.

156
00:10:12,129 --> 00:10:18,140
[Yes, Min Ah... that's how you do it.]

157
00:10:18,141 --> 00:10:21,519
No, they can't rip off our name tags.
No one will be able to resist you.

158
00:10:23,419 --> 00:10:25,669
Can't the two of us just run away
and live happily on our own?

159
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:29,245
- I see someone!
- Where?

160
00:10:29,246 --> 00:10:31,041
[There's someone!]

161
00:10:31,938 --> 00:10:34,092
[Could it be Kwang Soo?]

162
00:10:34,093 --> 00:10:35,511
Where?

163
00:10:37,705 --> 00:10:40,903
It was just the wind.

164
00:10:41,493 --> 00:10:44,534
Min Ah... are you starting to see things?

165
00:10:45,163 --> 00:10:48,823
[Could someone be outside?]

166
00:10:49,617 --> 00:10:51,078
There's no one out here.

167
00:10:51,079 --> 00:10:54,093
I feel like you're purposely going outside
because it feels cooler out there.

168
00:10:54,511 --> 00:10:58,093
Min Ah, I really want to go through
with this wedding.

169
00:10:58,785 --> 00:11:01,269
Min Ah, have you ever seen us playing
the name tag elimination game?

170
00:11:02,718 --> 00:11:06,396
[Min Ah and Gary are coming!]

171
00:11:07,452 --> 00:11:09,147
Get him!

172
00:11:10,196 --> 00:11:13,115
- Jae Suk, who did they eliminate?
- I don't know, but Gary's coming.

173
00:11:13,116 --> 00:11:15,412
I see Ji Hyo and Jae Suk over there.

174
00:11:15,413 --> 00:11:18,143
[Jae Suk and Ji Hyo are cornered.]

175
00:11:18,144 --> 00:11:20,432
- You go that way, and I go this way?
- Okay, on the count of three.

176
00:11:20,433 --> 00:11:22,604
[Min Ah to the left and Gary to the right.]

177
00:11:22,605 --> 00:11:24,178
Fighting!

178
00:11:24,806 --> 00:11:26,964
[Let's go and eliminate their name tags!]

179
00:11:26,965 --> 00:11:30,710
Jae Suk, you can't go that way!
Gary will be coming from that way.

180
00:11:30,711 --> 00:11:33,420
- Min Ah!
- Jae Suk, wait.

181
00:11:33,455 --> 00:11:36,116
- Min Ah's coming.
- Min Ah!

182
00:11:38,575 --> 00:11:41,464
[Let's make our escape!]

183
00:11:41,465 --> 00:11:43,769
[Jae Suk escapes the moment of danger
by the split of a hair.]

184
00:11:45,436 --> 00:11:48,029
- I can't consent to this marriage!
- You have no choice!

185
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:52,779
- I can't allow for this wedding to happen.
- I'm sorry, Ji Hyo.

186
00:11:53,309 --> 00:11:59,039
I'm really sorry, Ji Hyo,
but I really want to marry her.

187
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,561
[Song Ji Hyo- Out!]

188
00:12:02,155 --> 00:12:04,637
You're going to regret this, Min Ah.

189
00:12:04,638 --> 00:12:08,419
- You're going to regret this!
- I'm sorry for stealing your man away.

190
00:12:09,313 --> 00:12:13,696
- He's not a good man like you think he is!
- I'm sorry, Ji Hyo!

191
00:12:13,697 --> 00:12:15,289
[Sorry, but I have to get going.]

192
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:18,913
- Stop poisoning her with your words!
- This will be for the rest of your life!

193
00:12:18,914 --> 00:12:20,819
[The Monday Couple if shattered
with Min Ah in the picture.]

194
00:12:21,775 --> 00:12:24,722
She has no idea what kind of a man
Kang Gary really is.

195
00:12:26,593 --> 00:12:28,513
I'm in big trouble.

196
00:12:30,191 --> 00:12:32,233
Ugh, you startled me.

197
00:12:32,234 --> 00:12:34,825
- You really startled me.
- I had a feeling I'd find you here.

198
00:12:34,826 --> 00:12:37,087
[The meeting of the two enemies.]

199
00:12:42,191 --> 00:12:43,639
<i>Gary!</i>

200
00:12:44,583 --> 00:12:46,925
Jong Kook is over there.

201
00:12:46,926 --> 00:12:48,883
- Where?
- He's in that room over there.

202
00:12:49,687 --> 00:12:51,683
Hurry up and get him.

203
00:12:51,684 --> 00:12:53,635
Jong Kook is over there.

204
00:12:54,893 --> 00:13:00,012
[Since I'm already here,
let's eliminate you first.]

205
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:05,062
[Yoo Jae Suk- Out!]

206
00:13:05,063 --> 00:13:09,117
- I have to eliminate everyone right now.
- You are so frustrating!

207
00:13:09,118 --> 00:13:12,042
Just be patient. I have to
go through with this wedding.

208
00:13:13,318 --> 00:13:16,644
[With Jae Suk's help, Min Ah heads out
to catch Mr. Capable...]

209
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:25,487
- Who's back there?
- I have to go through with this wedding.

210
00:13:25,488 --> 00:13:28,000
- It's a boy.
- A boy?

211
00:13:28,847 --> 00:13:31,710
- There are two back there.
- Two? We've hit the jackpot!

212
00:13:34,362 --> 00:13:37,746
[Wait, that silhouette is...]

213
00:13:37,747 --> 00:13:41,398
Let's go, let's just go.
We can't eliminate this one.

214
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:43,381
- No, I want to eliminate him.
- You got someone?

215
00:13:43,382 --> 00:13:45,842
- I got someone here.
- that's his VJ.

216
00:13:45,843 --> 00:13:48,476
That's his personal VJ.

217
00:13:49,428 --> 00:13:53,308
- Min Ah, let's just come back later.
- I'm not letting go of the groom.

218
00:13:53,309 --> 00:13:55,539
- I can't let your groom go.
- Min Ah!

219
00:13:56,208 --> 00:14:00,879
[But Kkuk isn't able to remain
so strong in front of Min Ah...]

220
00:14:02,685 --> 00:14:04,294
Rip it off, Min Ah.

221
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,510
[I'll take care of Kkuk myself.]

222
00:14:09,434 --> 00:14:12,903
[Gary leaves the scene,
and it's a match of Min Ah vs Kkuk.]

223
00:14:12,904 --> 00:14:16,530
- I don't know what to do.
- I'm actually doing this for you.

224
00:14:16,531 --> 00:14:19,176
You're going to regret marrying him.
I'm his older brother.

225
00:14:19,177 --> 00:14:21,654
- Big brother...
- I'd be your brother in law.

226
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:25,412
- Why don't you go get someone else first?
- No, I can't.

227
00:14:25,413 --> 00:14:28,702
- Why not?
- Because you're the strongest opponent.

228
00:14:28,703 --> 00:14:31,440
It's too hot.

229
00:14:31,441 --> 00:14:35,001
[It's so hot in here...]

230
00:14:37,388 --> 00:14:40,439
[She says she's getting too hot...]

231
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:43,652
[Kim Jong Kook- Out!]

232
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:49,494
[After having held out for a while...]

233
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:57,454
The reason why I oppose
this marriage...

234
00:14:57,924 --> 00:15:01,351
First of all, I just don't like the idea of
marriage between those two people.

235
00:15:01,918 --> 00:15:07,640
I just feel like I'm the one
that she should be marrying.

236
00:15:08,128 --> 00:15:11,394
I did a project where I married
my very first love.

237
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:16,196
Ugh, you startled me.
Hello.

238
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:20,449
[Successful team play!
Already ousted three members.]

239
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:24,238
Does that fan feel good?

240
00:15:24,239 --> 00:15:26,839
- Yes, would you like to try it?
- No, it's okay.

241
00:15:33,286 --> 00:15:35,058
I feel a little awkward.

242
00:15:37,097 --> 00:15:42,743
- It's only been...
- A day since we started dating.

243
00:15:42,744 --> 00:15:45,145
It only took me a day to decide
that I wanted to marry her.

244
00:15:45,678 --> 00:15:48,962
[Big-nose is hiding under this table.]

245
00:15:51,318 --> 00:15:55,018
[Big-nose shines the light on himself
with the flashlight under the table.]

246
00:15:56,308 --> 00:15:58,430
This is the perfect hiding spot.

247
00:16:00,221 --> 00:16:04,355
[Min Ah and Gary start their search
through the reception hall.]

248
00:16:04,356 --> 00:16:06,188
<i>There aren't any hiding places in here.</i>

249
00:16:06,189 --> 00:16:07,810
Who is that?

250
00:16:09,101 --> 00:16:12,452
[Where is everyone?]

251
00:16:13,838 --> 00:16:18,943
[Wait, that is...]

252
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,513
[The wrong table.]

253
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:30,505
I'm starting to regret hiding under here.

254
00:16:31,646 --> 00:16:33,939
I should get out of here. I don't
think I can stay under here anymore.

255
00:16:34,249 --> 00:16:36,612
[You should just stay there...]

256
00:16:37,581 --> 00:16:39,169
Are they gone?

257
00:16:40,277 --> 00:16:43,531
That was the best hiding spot.

258
00:16:44,705 --> 00:16:46,909
This is the best hiding spot.

259
00:16:53,581 --> 00:16:55,917
[The way you look from behind...]

260
00:17:03,742 --> 00:17:07,578
[Gary has been watching him
from behind the door!]

261
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:11,270
[You're the one who came out
from under the table.]

262
00:17:11,783 --> 00:17:14,561
[Even Ha Ha is surprised from
up in the balcony!]

263
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:18,409
I was looking the other way!

264
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:21,170
[Ji Suk Jin- Out!]

265
00:17:22,717 --> 00:17:24,671
How did you know that
I was in here?

266
00:17:24,672 --> 00:17:26,775
[Good job, Gary!]

267
00:17:28,945 --> 00:17:31,257
- You guys are all here already?
- Did you get ousted?

268
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:33,005
What's Jong Kook doing here?

269
00:17:33,006 --> 00:17:34,633
[Still filled with his regrets.]

270
00:17:34,634 --> 00:17:38,041
Just as I predicted, Gary's doing
a good job of ousting people.

271
00:17:38,566 --> 00:17:40,134
Kwang Soo!

272
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:43,749
- Did you all get ousted?
- Yeah.

273
00:17:44,129 --> 00:17:47,047
Why don't you come and sit down?
Sit down and just look natural.

274
00:17:47,048 --> 00:17:50,552
Knowing Gary,
you might succeed in fooling him.

275
00:17:52,336 --> 00:17:54,049
Yeah, you should put my jacket on.

276
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:57,213
[Puts on Jong Kook's jacket in
an attempt to deceive Gary.]

277
00:17:57,214 --> 00:17:59,830
- Did you all get eliminated?
- What?

278
00:17:59,831 --> 00:18:01,861
- Yeah, we all got eliminated.
- Kwang Soo, too?

279
00:18:01,862 --> 00:18:03,767
No, not Kwang Soo.

280
00:18:03,768 --> 00:18:07,036
- Jong Suk, where did everyone go?
- I don't know.

281
00:18:07,037 --> 00:18:09,068
[Where did Gary and Min Ah go?]

282
00:18:09,069 --> 00:18:11,103
Look behind you!

283
00:18:12,718 --> 00:18:17,135
[Gary's too distracted with Jong Suk
to notice Kwang Soo sitting at the table.]

284
00:18:17,136 --> 00:18:21,063
Gary can't eliminate our team.
He can't eliminate his own team.

285
00:18:21,064 --> 00:18:23,341
[Even Min Ah just breezes past Kwang Soo.]

286
00:18:23,342 --> 00:18:25,775
That's a great idea.

287
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:30,727
Gary really is clueless sometimes.

288
00:18:31,457 --> 00:18:34,439
Min Ah, let's talk for a minute.
Wait!

289
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,439
[Full on attack!]

290
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:39,039
Grab him.

291
00:18:39,925 --> 00:18:43,445
- Gary, go that way.
- Wait.

292
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:46,618
- Let's talk.
- Min Ah!

293
00:18:46,619 --> 00:18:50,539
- Hurry!
- Wait, let's talk for a minute.

294
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:53,192
Now's the chance!
Eliminate him!

295
00:18:53,193 --> 00:18:55,877
How can you do this to me!

296
00:18:56,530 --> 00:18:59,493
[Jo Jung Suk- Out!]

297
00:19:01,077 --> 00:19:09,221
[Then... next up is Kwang Soo?]

298
00:19:09,222 --> 00:19:12,055
Who do I still have left?

299
00:19:12,056 --> 00:19:14,968
- Ha Ha?
- Yeah, Ha Ha.

300
00:19:14,969 --> 00:19:18,663
- Dong Hoon's still out there.
- Is Ha Ha the only one left?

301
00:19:18,664 --> 00:19:21,962
- I have to go through with this wedding.
- Dong Hoon's the last of us left?

302
00:19:21,963 --> 00:19:23,383
[Even pat's Kwang Soo on the shoulder
before he walks away.]

303
00:19:23,384 --> 00:19:25,907
- Is Dong Hoon the only one left?
- Fighting!

304
00:19:25,908 --> 00:19:28,287
- Dong Hoon, hide!
- Fighting!

305
00:19:28,831 --> 00:19:31,120
[Something doesn't feel right...]

306
00:19:32,553 --> 00:19:35,394
[Min Ah and Gary leave Kwang Soo
sitting at the table...]

307
00:19:35,395 --> 00:19:38,358
- I don't even know what to say.
- He really must be stupid.

308
00:19:38,359 --> 00:19:40,449
[Can't believe Gary was actually fooled...]

309
00:19:42,576 --> 00:19:47,348
He even patted me on the shoulder.
I feel bad, but he patted me before leaving.

310
00:19:47,349 --> 00:19:49,318
Maybe you're invisible to them.

311
00:19:49,319 --> 00:19:52,008
I feel kind of offended by that.

312
00:19:53,052 --> 00:19:57,702
[The only ones still left
are Kwang Soo and Ha Ha.]

313
00:19:59,226 --> 00:20:01,807
- I can't find him anywhere.
- I'll try to look for him.

314
00:20:01,808 --> 00:20:04,384
Gary, do you know what I think?

315
00:20:04,385 --> 00:20:08,635
I think he's hiding under
one of those tables in there.

316
00:20:08,636 --> 00:20:10,617
I thought we already looked in there.

317
00:20:10,618 --> 00:20:14,789
[Wait, that's...]

318
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:17,835
I found him.
He's up there on the balcony.

319
00:20:18,627 --> 00:20:22,087
[Ha Ha is discovered.]

320
00:20:22,088 --> 00:20:23,451
I found him.

321
00:20:23,452 --> 00:20:26,023
I think he saw me.

322
00:20:29,223 --> 00:20:31,316
My arms are too short.

323
00:20:33,689 --> 00:20:36,066
[Lying down on the floor?]

324
00:20:36,971 --> 00:20:40,503
[A perfect fit.]

325
00:20:43,064 --> 00:20:47,275
[I will do everything I can to endure this
and become the groom myself.]

326
00:20:47,276 --> 00:20:51,751
[My short limbs... stay strong!]

327
00:20:52,149 --> 00:20:55,120
[But the door opens too easily.]

328
00:20:57,585 --> 00:21:00,771
Min Ah, you've lost your mind.
This isn't right!

329
00:21:00,772 --> 00:21:03,169
Wait, this isn't right, Min Ah.

330
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:05,784
[Haroro's last desperate attempts.]

331
00:21:05,785 --> 00:21:10,197
No, I oppose this marriage!
I oppose!

332
00:21:11,294 --> 00:21:14,353
[Ha Ha- Out!]

333
00:21:14,821 --> 00:21:17,909
- We got everyone.
- What do we do now?

334
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:19,942
We have to get married now.

335
00:21:22,353 --> 00:21:25,728
[Everyone's gathered together
at the wedding ceremony site.]

336
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:29,003
Let's go get married.

337
00:21:29,004 --> 00:21:30,710
Really?

338
00:21:35,311 --> 00:21:37,457
[They can't possibly...]

339
00:21:38,513 --> 00:21:44,296
[Kwang Soo... it's over!]

340
00:21:44,785 --> 00:21:47,598
No, wait!

341
00:21:48,517 --> 00:21:50,073
[Lee Kwang Soo- Out!]

342
00:21:50,074 --> 00:21:53,297
- You just realized it now, didn't you?
- No, I've known about it!

343
00:21:53,298 --> 00:21:54,945
[When they realized
the truth about Kwang Soo.]

344
00:21:54,946 --> 00:21:56,808
- We got everyone, right?
- Did we get everyone?

345
00:21:57,306 --> 00:22:00,448
- Did we get Kwang Soo?
- Did we not get him? He was sitting there.

346
00:22:00,449 --> 00:22:02,988
Did we get him?
No, I didn't get him.

347
00:22:02,989 --> 00:22:05,731
- I didn't get him either.
- He's my twin brother.

348
00:22:05,732 --> 00:22:07,759
Then he deceived us
and is just sitting there?

349
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,234
[Slow Gary finally realizes the truth.]

350
00:22:10,235 --> 00:22:12,159
You have to lure him.

351
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:15,315
- You have to trick him.
- Okay, I will. We got everyone.

352
00:22:15,316 --> 00:22:17,099
[Thus, their plan was to trick Kwang Soo.]

353
00:22:18,103 --> 00:22:21,693
[Opposing family name tag elimination-
Mission clear!]

354
00:22:21,694 --> 00:22:24,311
Everyone now consents to their marriage.

355
00:22:24,912 --> 00:22:28,774
[Min Ah and Gary's wedding
finally gets underway.]

356
00:22:28,775 --> 00:22:32,089
- Please allow for us to get married.
- What a joke!

357
00:22:33,819 --> 00:22:35,997
[Wedding photo.]

358
00:22:36,731 --> 00:22:39,188
That's just absolutely absurd.

359
00:22:39,189 --> 00:22:42,033
[The newlywed's kiss is omitted.]

360
00:22:42,034 --> 00:22:47,078
Even though you're now a part of our family,
and you two should live happily together

361
00:22:47,079 --> 00:22:48,887
you never know what life
may have in store for you.

362
00:22:48,888 --> 00:22:52,124
- No, we're going to love each other forever.
- My most sincerest congratulations.

363
00:22:52,599 --> 00:22:55,017
- What is this? Is this for real?
- Are they really getting married?

364
00:22:55,018 --> 00:22:58,231
Is the show over?
Are we going on our honeymoon now?

365
00:22:58,232 --> 00:23:04,226
You have successfully gotten married after
the sweet, yet brief courtship.

366
00:23:04,227 --> 00:23:08,945
I congratulate you wholeheartedly,
and it's now time for the honeymoon.

367
00:23:08,946 --> 00:23:10,390
Are we going to Maldives?

368
00:23:10,391 --> 00:23:14,585
The newlyweds can go together in
their wedding car.

369
00:23:14,586 --> 00:23:19,433
As for the remaining family members, you
will go in one car since you're now in-laws.

370
00:23:19,434 --> 00:23:22,802
In one car?
No, I'd rather take the bus!

371
00:23:22,803 --> 00:23:25,762
[The deep rooted resentment
between the two families.]

372
00:23:25,763 --> 00:23:27,677
We want to go separately.

373
00:23:28,793 --> 00:23:31,199
We'll see everyone in a little bit.
Sorry, excuse us.

374
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:34,969
[The newlyweds head out hand in hand.]

375
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:37,361
This is the worst wedding I've
even been to.

376
00:23:37,362 --> 00:23:40,816
- They didn't feed us anything.
- Out of my way!

377
00:23:46,104 --> 00:23:50,665
[Chapter one-
Courtship, then the wedding.]

378
00:23:51,728 --> 00:23:53,338
Let's go.

379
00:23:53,965 --> 00:23:56,843
[Off to ride away in their wedding car.]

380
00:23:56,844 --> 00:23:59,580
I'm going to brag out loud
for everyone to hear.

381
00:24:00,403 --> 00:24:02,013
Min Ah!

382
00:24:02,014 --> 00:24:05,890
[Gary's consideration for Min Ah.]

383
00:24:09,985 --> 00:24:11,440
- Let's go.
- So many cameras.

384
00:24:11,441 --> 00:24:13,780
- There are a lot of cameras, aren't there?
- Yes.

385
00:24:14,921 --> 00:24:19,075
[The appearance of the two families.]

386
00:24:19,076 --> 00:24:21,096
- You're really going to regret this.
- We're so happy right now!

387
00:24:21,097 --> 00:24:24,030
- No, you can't be happy about this.
- You really have to think about this.

388
00:24:24,031 --> 00:24:26,366
Min Ah, you're happy, aren't you?
What are you doing?

389
00:24:26,367 --> 00:24:29,331
[Min Ah's twin brother, Giraffe,
uninvited gets into the car.]

390
00:24:29,332 --> 00:24:31,940
- Come on, let me ride with you guys.
- No, leave! I don't want you to.

391
00:24:31,941 --> 00:24:34,239
- Pretend I'm not even here.
- No, leave!

392
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,158
Min Ah, here's my phone number.

393
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:39,149
What are you doing?
Don't be that kind of an in-law.

394
00:24:41,759 --> 00:24:44,631
Ugh, I'm sorry.
They're a rowdy bunch, aren't they?

395
00:24:46,537 --> 00:24:48,959
- Congratulations on your wedding.
- Okay.

396
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:54,700
This is a list of most desirable items
by recently married couples.

397
00:24:55,606 --> 00:24:57,102
With the exception of these two spots

398
00:24:57,103 --> 00:25:02,873
write down the items that you'd most
like to have in these empty circles.

399
00:25:02,874 --> 00:25:05,951
A list of most desirable items
by newlyweds.

400
00:25:06,467 --> 00:25:08,045
- TV.
- TV?

401
00:25:08,046 --> 00:25:10,079
- What else?
- The air conditioner.

402
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:13,821
- And the bidet?
- Bidet? That could come in handy.

403
00:25:13,822 --> 00:25:16,911
You're choosing very rationally.
Okay, bidet.

404
00:25:17,226 --> 00:25:19,297
- Bedding?
- Bedding?

405
00:25:19,298 --> 00:25:21,838
Yes, we'd need some bedding.

406
00:25:21,839 --> 00:25:23,941
How about some bathrobes?

407
00:25:24,871 --> 00:25:27,575
- A pair of bathrobes?
- Sure.

408
00:25:28,205 --> 00:25:31,149
Even these small moments
bring me so much happiness.

409
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:33,685
Okay, let's go.

410
00:25:33,686 --> 00:25:36,617
[Off they go in their lone car ride.]

411
00:25:37,458 --> 00:25:40,126
- What about pet names for each other?
- Pet names?

412
00:25:41,474 --> 00:25:43,970
What do you think about,
'Goldie' and 'Jade'?

413
00:25:43,971 --> 00:25:46,659
- Who's the Goldie?
- I'd be the Goldie.

414
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:49,598
- Then I'd be the Jade?
- Yeah.

415
00:25:49,599 --> 00:25:51,714
- No, I don't want to do that.
- Why not?

416
00:25:51,715 --> 00:25:53,899
I'm sick of those names.

417
00:25:54,471 --> 00:25:58,021
I just want both our families
to disappear.

418
00:25:58,022 --> 00:26:00,851
Are we going to get fed soon?

419
00:26:00,852 --> 00:26:03,309
Kimchi stew or soybean stew.
On the count of three.

420
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:06,249
- Soybean stew.
- Soybean stew.

421
00:26:08,348 --> 00:26:10,757
- How about kimchi soybean stew?
- Okay.

422
00:26:10,758 --> 00:26:15,846
- Let's never break up, okay?
- Yes, Ri.

423
00:26:15,847 --> 00:26:18,722
- We are...
- Pretty-Ri!

424
00:26:19,205 --> 00:26:21,782
- I think we're getting used to it.
- Yes.

425
00:26:23,133 --> 00:26:26,991
- Jung Suk, are you a good singer?
- Jung Suk is a musical actor.

426
00:26:26,992 --> 00:26:30,196
- Seriously?
- Do you even know anything about Jung Suk?

427
00:26:30,197 --> 00:26:33,428
Jung Suk made a name for himself
on the musical stage.

428
00:26:33,429 --> 00:26:35,212
Don't you know the song,
'Right at this moment...'

429
00:26:35,213 --> 00:26:37,768
'Right at this moment...'

430
00:26:37,769 --> 00:26:40,672
<i>Right at this moment...
Like a total fool! (Got the lyrics wrong.)</i>

431
00:26:41,166 --> 00:26:46,360
<i>Right at this moment...</i>

432
00:26:46,869 --> 00:26:48,907
[Our fool of a big brother...]

433
00:26:48,908 --> 00:26:51,743
- Let's hear Jung Suk sing.
- Yes, let's hear him sing for us.

434
00:26:51,744 --> 00:26:55,039
[Jung Suk's rendition of
'Right at this moment' from his musical.]

435
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,977
Yes, I want to hear him sing.

436
00:27:02,075 --> 00:27:04,600
[An explosive reaction.]

437
00:27:04,601 --> 00:27:08,613
- Stop reacting like that.
- Stop, we just want to hear him sing!

438
00:27:08,648 --> 00:27:11,515
[These in-laws have a long way to go.]

439
00:27:12,281 --> 00:27:15,354
Sorry about that.
Seriously...

440
00:27:15,355 --> 00:27:23,301
<i>This moment,
that I have so desperately longed for.</i>

441
00:27:23,302 --> 00:27:25,353
[A forced mute button.]

442
00:27:25,354 --> 00:27:30,485
<i>My own dream, and my own wish...</i>

443
00:27:30,486 --> 00:27:37,699
<i>I don't know if they'll ever come true...
at least right at this moment.</i>

444
00:27:39,681 --> 00:27:43,806
[Jung Suk's singing hits
all the right emotional notes.]

445
00:27:45,203 --> 00:27:46,729
Be quiet!

446
00:27:46,730 --> 00:27:49,249
We're still reeling from
the emotions of his singing.

447
00:27:50,096 --> 00:27:56,447
<i>Right at this moment,
like a spell of magic...</i>

448
00:27:56,448 --> 00:28:02,588
<i>I throw away the chains that
kept me tethered down.</i>

449
00:28:02,589 --> 00:28:08,749
<i>All I have at this moment,
is my own conviction...</i>

450
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:15,879
<i>that the only thing that's left
for me is my own victory!</i>

451
00:28:17,241 --> 00:28:23,870
[Right at this moment,
it feels like we are the world...]

452
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:28,904
['E' Cafe in Gyunggi-do.]

453
00:28:29,284 --> 00:28:32,703
- What are we doing here?
- What is all this?

454
00:28:32,704 --> 00:28:37,979
[The sweet feel of a newlywed's home
can be felt throughout the space.]

455
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:41,624
Wow, look at the pictures of Min Ah.
She looks so pretty in her pictures.

456
00:28:41,625 --> 00:28:45,403
What's taking them so long?
Why aren't they even here yet?

457
00:28:45,404 --> 00:28:48,143
I know from my experience of being
with Gary for the past four years

458
00:28:48,144 --> 00:28:50,360
but he's a really awful driver.

459
00:28:50,361 --> 00:28:52,951
- You sound jealous.
- He's a really bad driver.

460
00:28:52,952 --> 00:28:55,052
She sounds really jealous right now.

461
00:28:55,053 --> 00:28:56,958
- That's pretty tacky.
- She's the obsessive type.

462
00:28:56,959 --> 00:29:00,626
I'm not being obsessive.
I just don't want to see my sister suffer.

463
00:29:00,627 --> 00:29:02,125
[Is that all?]

464
00:29:02,126 --> 00:29:03,946
- She really must've liked Gary.
- Here they come.

465
00:29:03,947 --> 00:29:05,981
[The newlyweds finally arrive.]

466
00:29:05,982 --> 00:29:09,753
- The homeowners are here.
- You're grinning from ear to ear.

467
00:29:10,595 --> 00:29:13,129
- What the heck?
- Why are you holding her hand?

468
00:29:13,130 --> 00:29:16,985
- Hey, don't hold her hand!
- What? I'm just holding my wife's hand.

469
00:29:16,986 --> 00:29:19,979
- Don't hold her hand!
- You saw how Min Ah held on, right?

470
00:29:20,522 --> 00:29:24,914
I'm sorry to ask this, but what were you
doing that took you two so long to get here?

471
00:29:24,915 --> 00:29:28,135
- I just really need to know the answer.
- What did we do?

472
00:29:28,517 --> 00:29:31,637
- I'm sure they were talking about...
- Please don't do that.

473
00:29:31,638 --> 00:29:33,456
Why are you two whispering?

474
00:29:33,457 --> 00:29:36,525
- We were talking about a trip.
- A trip we're going to go on together.

475
00:29:36,526 --> 00:29:40,411
- You're going on a trip together?
- No, we were talking about our past trips.

476
00:29:41,111 --> 00:29:43,415
You two must've had a lot
to talk about.

477
00:29:43,416 --> 00:29:46,046
- Yes, we talked about things like that.
- You two must've shared a lot of stories.

478
00:29:46,047 --> 00:29:51,427
You have all now become one family with
the marriage of Gary and Min Ah.

479
00:29:51,428 --> 00:29:53,427
- Yes.
- Wow, it feels like a real marriage.

480
00:29:53,428 --> 00:29:55,430
It feels like the in-laws have
yet to become very close.

481
00:29:55,431 --> 00:30:00,995
We have prepared a group mission that
you all will do together as one unit

482
00:30:00,996 --> 00:30:02,988
to help bring everyone closer
as family.

483
00:30:02,989 --> 00:30:06,169
Every time you successfully complete
each of these missions

484
00:30:06,170 --> 00:30:11,006
you will be given a lottery ticket that
is worth quite a sum of money.

485
00:30:11,007 --> 00:30:13,394
- You will be given a lottery ticket.
- Really?

486
00:30:13,395 --> 00:30:15,036
We're not going to have a choice
but to work together.

487
00:30:15,037 --> 00:30:20,326
Only one of these five lottery tickets
is the actual winning ticket.

488
00:30:20,327 --> 00:30:26,686
Only when you succeed the mission,
will you be able to scratch off the ticket.

489
00:30:27,243 --> 00:30:31,176
- First...
- Pretty... how about you do it?

490
00:30:31,177 --> 00:30:33,786
Did someone say, Pretty?

491
00:30:33,787 --> 00:30:36,020
[Automatically responds to the name, Pretty.]

492
00:30:36,021 --> 00:30:38,772
- How are you 'Pretty'?
- You two seem closer to each other.

493
00:30:38,773 --> 00:30:40,860
- We have a pet name for each other.
- Seriously?

494
00:30:40,861 --> 00:30:44,504
- Min Ah, what do you call Gary?
- Ri.

495
00:30:44,505 --> 00:30:46,396
- Ri?
- What's that?

496
00:30:46,397 --> 00:30:48,652
I guess she couldn't think of
anything else to call him by.

497
00:30:48,653 --> 00:30:52,630
Your first mission is...
'As long as it's with you.'

498
00:30:52,631 --> 00:31:01,101
Each person will take one end of
a noodle strand and meet in the middle.

499
00:31:01,102 --> 00:31:03,080
Look at Gary.

500
00:31:03,081 --> 00:31:06,240
The total length from all the couples must be
less than 5cm combined in order to win.

501
00:31:06,241 --> 00:31:08,522
- 5cm?
- Less than 5cm?

502
00:31:08,523 --> 00:31:13,515
- I think that's too long.
- How about 4cm for four boy-girl couples?

503
00:31:13,516 --> 00:31:16,416
No, we'll go with three couples with
a total combined length of 3cm.

504
00:31:16,417 --> 00:31:18,690
Okay, we'll go with the 3cm!

505
00:31:18,691 --> 00:31:22,455
- Okay, we're just going to watch.
- Why don't you watch from here?

506
00:31:22,456 --> 00:31:24,487
I'm going to watch Shin Min Ah.

507
00:31:24,488 --> 00:31:29,339
[Everyone else seems to be doing well,
but how am I going to do this?]

508
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:32,719
[Whatever the case, let's just bite down.]

509
00:31:34,303 --> 00:31:41,059
- Song Ji Hyo, you're being really forward.
- Jung Suk, I'm keeping my eyes on you.

510
00:31:43,133 --> 00:31:45,506
Ready.

511
00:31:45,507 --> 00:31:47,961
- Hurry up!
- Who's not ready yet?

512
00:31:47,962 --> 00:31:50,331
- It's Gary.
- Is this how I do it?

513
00:31:50,332 --> 00:31:54,108
- Ugh, seriously.
- Wow, this is awesome.

514
00:31:54,109 --> 00:31:58,235
- Jong Suk, just touch her lips.
- This is awesome.

515
00:31:58,236 --> 00:32:02,476
- Jong Suk, just touch her lips.
- It's a nice picture, except for those two.

516
00:32:09,210 --> 00:32:13,240
[Automatically cringes back
just from watching these two.]

517
00:32:19,856 --> 00:32:21,947
[Second team- Jong Suk and Ji Hyo.]

518
00:32:23,568 --> 00:32:25,499
[Here I go.]

519
00:32:25,943 --> 00:32:28,065
[Okay, come.]

520
00:32:28,066 --> 00:32:30,275
[We're both actors.]

521
00:32:33,371 --> 00:32:35,977
- Go in further!
- You can touch her lips!

522
00:32:35,978 --> 00:32:38,885
- Song Ji Hyo, work harder.
- It has to be 1cm.

523
00:32:40,398 --> 00:32:42,814
[Audience is really getting into it.]

524
00:32:43,975 --> 00:32:47,774
[The noodle strand is getting shorter
and shorter without any hesitation.]

525
00:32:47,775 --> 00:32:49,270
- With your teeth!
- Go in further!

526
00:32:49,271 --> 00:32:51,577
[We'll see about that, Song Ji Hyo.]

527
00:32:53,956 --> 00:32:56,903
- It should've been shorter!
- No, I think we got it.

528
00:32:56,904 --> 00:33:00,545
You two need to finish it up.
It's up to you guys now.

529
00:33:00,546 --> 00:33:03,935
This is what we've got,
so you two need to get it done.

530
00:33:05,773 --> 00:33:08,341
[The bride doesn't seem to show
any sign of nervousness.]

531
00:33:08,706 --> 00:33:11,117
[The groom doesn't seem to be sure
whether this is a dream or reality...]

532
00:33:11,757 --> 00:33:13,759
[It's not going to be easy.]

533
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:17,101
- You need to get it down to 0.2cm.
- No need to be nervous about it.

534
00:33:21,614 --> 00:33:24,372
[Both players approaches each other's lips
without any show of hesitation.]

535
00:33:24,373 --> 00:33:26,196
[But this person doesn't seem to be
happy about it.]

536
00:33:30,695 --> 00:33:35,225
[We can't lose to the other couple!]

537
00:33:36,928 --> 00:33:39,251
[Screams out loud in response.]

538
00:33:41,471 --> 00:33:44,653
[It's no big deal to an actress like me.]

539
00:33:46,102 --> 00:33:48,087
- It's almost gone.
- Did you see Min Ah?

540
00:33:48,088 --> 00:33:51,102
Did you see how Min Ah was
just doing this?

541
00:33:51,103 --> 00:33:54,378
[Min Ah shows just how comfortable she
is with what she had just done.]

542
00:33:54,379 --> 00:33:57,035
She looked completely at ease.

543
00:33:57,036 --> 00:33:59,364
[Showing off her talent
as a skilled actress.]

544
00:33:59,365 --> 00:34:01,959
She was just standing there
and slurping it down like this.

545
00:34:03,828 --> 00:34:06,149
[That was no big deal.]

546
00:34:06,150 --> 00:34:09,216
- How can you not even be blushing?
- Gary's face is so red.

547
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:13,925
Shin Min Ah's really forward.
She's really good at this game.

548
00:34:13,926 --> 00:34:15,232
How are you so good at that?

549
00:34:15,698 --> 00:34:19,332
You have to just think of your lips touching
and get it as short as you can.

550
00:34:19,333 --> 00:34:22,455
You had an ulterior motive, didn't you?

551
00:34:22,456 --> 00:34:24,647
She didn't feel shy about it at all.

552
00:34:24,648 --> 00:34:28,472
- Ji Hyo, your hands were up by his face.
- Gary...

553
00:34:28,473 --> 00:34:30,479
Are you getting jealous right now?

554
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:37,761
Ji Hyo and Jung Suk's noodle length
is 1.1cm.

555
00:34:37,762 --> 00:34:41,134
- We got this.
- We should be good, right?

556
00:34:41,135 --> 00:34:44,660
Jae Suk and Kwang Soo's length is 0.6cm.

557
00:34:44,661 --> 00:34:47,903
- That's amazing.
- Their length is less than 1cm.

558
00:34:47,904 --> 00:34:52,593
Gary and Min Ah's length is 0.4cm.

559
00:34:53,055 --> 00:34:56,685
That's because Min Ah slurped down
the last bit of it.

560
00:34:56,686 --> 00:34:58,705
[They got to see first-hand how skilled
Min Ah can be at this game.]

561
00:34:58,706 --> 00:35:04,811
Thus, Min Ah and Gary just earned the
chance to choose a lottery ticket.

562
00:35:04,812 --> 00:35:07,967
[Time to check their lottery ticket.]

563
00:35:08,402 --> 00:35:11,605
- Try scratching one.
- What if this is the winning ticket?

564
00:35:11,606 --> 00:35:13,007
If it turns out to be the winning ticket,
then it's the end of the race.

565
00:35:13,008 --> 00:35:15,611
Will they get actual real money?

566
00:35:16,317 --> 00:35:19,293
[It's a dud!
Perhaps next time.]

567
00:35:20,323 --> 00:35:22,713
They're not all duds, are they?

568
00:35:24,087 --> 00:35:27,595
- You may now choose the next one.
- Choose a good one, Jung Suk.

569
00:35:28,686 --> 00:35:30,671
[Second lottery ticket selection.]

570
00:35:30,672 --> 00:35:35,689
[Must pass the next mission in order
to check to see if it's the winning ticket.]

571
00:35:35,690 --> 00:35:37,617
Here's your next mission.

572
00:35:37,943 --> 00:35:41,152
It's a game that can't be left out at
a newlywed's housewarming party.

573
00:35:41,701 --> 00:35:44,132
It's time to hear
the bride's singing talents.

574
00:35:44,133 --> 00:35:45,466
[Bride's singing talents.]

575
00:35:45,467 --> 00:35:47,153
- Me?
- Yes, of course.

576
00:35:47,154 --> 00:35:51,537
The second mission, 'Bride's love song.'
Choose your favorite song to sing.

577
00:35:51,538 --> 00:35:53,868
Min Ah never seems nervous
about anything.

578
00:35:53,869 --> 00:35:57,080
- What do you mean?
- Girls always squirm and protest it.

579
00:35:57,081 --> 00:35:58,874
But all she said was, 'Me?'

580
00:35:58,875 --> 00:36:00,784
[Remaining so cool
in all types of situations.]

581
00:36:00,923 --> 00:36:03,128
- She shows her agitation in the back.
- Really?

582
00:36:03,129 --> 00:36:05,975
When people are looking elsewhere,
she shows her nervousness like this.

583
00:36:05,976 --> 00:36:08,480
- She doesn't seem nervous whatsoever.
- She seems so composed.

584
00:36:08,773 --> 00:36:12,848
It's fun to do things like this
at a housewarming party.

585
00:36:12,849 --> 00:36:15,516
[Must score 90 points or above to win.]

586
00:36:16,058 --> 00:36:19,312
- I'd like to sing, 'Please stop the wind.'
- Nice choice!

587
00:36:20,222 --> 00:36:24,060
[If the bride fails to score 90 points,
then the other members will be punished.]

588
00:36:24,061 --> 00:36:26,048
Don't worry, I'd never cheat on you.

589
00:36:26,049 --> 00:36:33,667
<i>If you can't sing, then you can't marry.
Ugh, what a hateful person.</i>

590
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:39,861
['Please stop the wind' by Lee Ji Yeon.]

591
00:36:39,862 --> 00:36:41,451
I'm so nervous!

592
00:36:43,314 --> 00:36:48,791
[At least for this one moment,
they are as one family and one heart.]

593
00:36:50,128 --> 00:36:56,555
[The love song sang by
the beautiful October bride.]

594
00:36:58,991 --> 00:37:01,901
[Such a clear voice.]

595
00:37:03,241 --> 00:37:08,573
[Singing confidently without
any sign of nervousness.]

596
00:37:18,632 --> 00:37:22,051
[Gets into the groove of the song,
and moves out of his designated spot.]

597
00:37:23,374 --> 00:37:26,783
[The groom dances along to
his bride's singing.]

598
00:37:37,089 --> 00:37:39,568
[Get out of here!]

599
00:37:40,269 --> 00:37:44,007
[Pushes the Giraffe out so that
he could have more dance space.]

600
00:37:49,043 --> 00:37:53,674
[The party guests are getting into the feel
of the party with the bride's singing.]

601
00:37:54,213 --> 00:37:58,303
[Min Ah's talent from her many participation
of previous OST singing shines through.]

602
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:03,901
He's dancing along as if
he's doing a musical right now.

603
00:38:04,727 --> 00:38:07,805
[Plays the tambourine as if
he's in a musical.]

604
00:38:20,366 --> 00:38:23,464
[The newlywed's wave.]

605
00:38:25,353 --> 00:38:29,681
[Everybody... stop.]

606
00:38:30,485 --> 00:38:33,745
[Singing together as
one heart, and one family.]

607
00:38:33,746 --> 00:38:37,475
Extra points for enthusiasm is...
five points!

608
00:38:37,510 --> 00:38:40,115
- We just need 85 points.
- We only need 85 points!

609
00:38:40,116 --> 00:38:41,747
[85 points or above,
then it's mission clear!]

610
00:38:41,748 --> 00:38:45,125
[What will be the score?]

611
00:38:49,859 --> 00:38:53,319
[87 points plus five is...
A total of 92 points!]

612
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:56,824
[Succeeds the mission on the
first attempt!]

613
00:38:58,459 --> 00:39:02,840
[Once again, the success is all thanks
to the enthusiastic new bride!]

614
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:09,787
Want to sing one more song with
another lottery ticket on the line?

615
00:39:09,788 --> 00:39:12,462
There's no stopping you.

616
00:39:12,463 --> 00:39:16,063
There's nothing that Min Ah
isn't good at.

617
00:39:16,064 --> 00:39:18,204
- Let's go for one more lottery ticket.
- One more song.

618
00:39:18,205 --> 00:39:20,399
[An encore song with
one more lottery ticket on the line.]

619
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:23,275
- We'll sing another song.
- As promised, this mission is a success.

620
00:39:23,276 --> 00:39:26,353
[With the success of the mission,
it's a chance to check another ticket.]

621
00:39:26,354 --> 00:39:30,218
- We need to sing another song.
- 87 points is a great score.

622
00:39:30,861 --> 00:39:34,853
Since we already succeeded this mission,
let's really crank it up this time.

623
00:39:34,854 --> 00:39:38,668
- Jong Suk, it's your turn to sing.
- She's the goddess of these games.

624
00:39:38,669 --> 00:39:41,788
- That's awesome.
- She really is amazing.

625
00:39:43,212 --> 00:39:44,617
I don't know what to sing.

626
00:39:44,618 --> 00:39:46,543
[It's musical star,
Jung Suk's time to shine.]

627
00:39:46,544 --> 00:39:48,881
- Should I sing something upbeat?
- Yes, do that.

628
00:39:50,501 --> 00:39:53,893
[Choosing the lottery ticket
for the encore mission.]

629
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:57,600
I feel so comfortable
with these two already.

630
00:39:57,601 --> 00:40:00,306
They both like to sing old
people's songs.

631
00:40:02,869 --> 00:40:05,281
[What will this musical star choose to sing?]

632
00:40:05,371 --> 00:40:08,359
[Jung Suk chooses to sing, 'Sorrow.']

633
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:10,085
Party time!

634
00:40:10,777 --> 00:40:13,271
[Sorrow- 1998.]

635
00:40:13,272 --> 00:40:16,792
[A dance show right off the bat.]

636
00:40:19,478 --> 00:40:21,602
[I told you to get out of here!]

637
00:40:24,813 --> 00:40:28,453
[Jung Suk's musical version
of the song, 'Sorrow'.]

638
00:40:28,876 --> 00:40:31,467
[Perfectly in sync.]

639
00:40:36,510 --> 00:40:39,381
[His stellar singing talent can be heard
with the opening lyrics.]

640
00:40:40,030 --> 00:40:44,292
[Matching dance moves to the song
from another era.]

641
00:40:47,487 --> 00:40:49,215
<i>No, that's not it...</i>

642
00:40:49,216 --> 00:40:52,139
[It's your tune that isn't it.]

643
00:40:57,761 --> 00:41:00,919
[Jung Suk and Blank Ji's
duet performance.]

644
00:41:07,567 --> 00:41:11,769
[Jung Suk's musical version of the song!]

645
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:36,951
[A very enthusiastic
housewarming party guests.]

646
00:41:41,168 --> 00:41:44,795
[The newlyweds are immersed
in their dance moves.]

647
00:41:54,629 --> 00:41:57,874
[This housewarming party
will go down in history.]

648
00:42:09,799 --> 00:42:13,662
[What kind of a score
will they receive this time?]

649
00:42:18,550 --> 00:42:20,378
[Wow!]

650
00:42:20,714 --> 00:42:23,240
[98 points!
Succeeds another mission!]

651
00:42:23,241 --> 00:42:26,077
[Succeeds two missions in a row!]

652
00:42:26,812 --> 00:42:30,489
[A perfect harmony made possible
by these two families.]

653
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:35,278
You have earned two lottery tickets.
We can't give you any more than that.

654
00:42:35,279 --> 00:42:39,899
- You have the two tickets, don't you?
- Why are you stuttering your speech?

655
00:42:42,127 --> 00:42:44,563
[You didn't know we'd be this
good, did you?]

656
00:42:45,055 --> 00:42:50,203
Even if you're to go to karaoke bars,
it's impossible to get these kinds of scores.

657
00:42:51,473 --> 00:42:55,033
[These housewarming party guests are taking
a long trip down the singing memory lane.]

658
00:42:55,535 --> 00:42:59,307
[Another encore song without even
a lottery ticket on the line.]

659
00:42:59,308 --> 00:43:01,572
- How about 'From the bus'?
- Ji Hyo's really excited.

660
00:43:01,573 --> 00:43:04,908
[Everyone's in very high spirits as if
they're on a fun outing.]

661
00:43:05,661 --> 00:43:08,491
How about the song, '3!4!'

662
00:43:08,492 --> 00:43:11,472
[Once wildly popular, '3!4!' is chosen.]

663
00:43:11,473 --> 00:43:14,065
- 3!4!
- We have to start it off right.

664
00:43:14,066 --> 00:43:16,537
[The start of the song is the
most important part of the song.]

665
00:43:16,538 --> 00:43:20,184
[Director Haroro is taking the song
very seriously.]

666
00:43:20,558 --> 00:43:24,060
- Just sit around comfortably.
- How are we doing this?

667
00:43:25,267 --> 00:43:28,762
['3!4!'- 1996.]

668
00:43:29,773 --> 00:43:33,027
[The lone contemporary dancer.]

669
00:43:33,028 --> 00:43:35,775
- What are you doing?
- You're not the star of the song!

670
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:44,931
- When do we stand up?
- Starting from the right.

671
00:43:44,932 --> 00:43:46,828
When she says, '3!4!.'

672
00:43:58,418 --> 00:44:00,727
[Drops down two octaves.]

673
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:03,539
[Now is the time!]

674
00:44:07,295 --> 00:44:10,661
[In an orderly fashion.]

675
00:44:10,662 --> 00:44:13,995
[The two families become
one with the music.]

676
00:44:17,546 --> 00:44:20,793
[MC Memi-Nem's freestyle rap.]

677
00:44:23,042 --> 00:44:24,623
Your footsteps are so fast!

678
00:44:25,641 --> 00:44:28,310
[Impressive footwork.]

679
00:44:31,194 --> 00:44:33,347
[Make way for the new King of Dance!]

680
00:44:37,055 --> 00:44:39,671
Me?
Okay, I like that!

681
00:44:39,998 --> 00:44:42,624
[A dance battle with Ha Ha.]

682
00:44:42,625 --> 00:44:45,317
[I can't let you beat me!]

683
00:44:47,709 --> 00:44:49,656
[Jung Suk has another trick up his sleeve.]

684
00:44:52,421 --> 00:44:54,050
[Come on!]

685
00:44:55,859 --> 00:45:00,792
[Sees Ha Ha's moves, and Jung Suk
immediately copies the moves.]

686

[Turbo's dancing Tiger.]

687
00:45:08,618 --> 00:45:11,699
[Dream concert housewarming party.]

688
00:45:13,193 --> 00:45:16,758
[The perfect impromptu performance.]

689
00:45:18,178 --> 00:45:21,522
[I can't get tired out now.]

690
00:45:21,523 --> 00:45:23,714
[A musical performance.]

691
00:45:24,248 --> 00:45:29,600
[One move... and one heart.]

692
00:45:32,154 --> 00:45:35,192
[Really getting into it!]

693
00:45:35,193 --> 00:45:37,500
<i>Where will this breathing
moment take me?</i>

694
00:45:37,535 --> 00:45:44,517
<i>From where all these moments are
starting to jumble together...</i>

695
00:45:54,059 --> 00:46:00,068
[Wishing the newlyweds
a lifetime of happiness...]

696
00:46:06,335 --> 00:46:08,017
Bend over.

697
00:46:13,156 --> 00:46:14,881
[A perfect reenactment of
the song's original dance moves.]

698
00:46:24,717 --> 00:46:28,662
[A very enthusiastic and
passionate housewarming party.]

699
00:46:28,663 --> 00:46:30,387
There's no stopping us!

700
00:46:35,022 --> 00:46:38,333
[Top score with everything
that they sing!]

701
00:46:38,931 --> 00:46:41,637
- That was good.
- Did everyone have fun?

702
00:46:41,638 --> 00:46:44,870
All the songs we sang were
from the nineties.

703
00:46:44,871 --> 00:46:47,643
[A time traced back to the nineties
with their singing.]

704
00:46:47,644 --> 00:46:49,917
I'm sure one of those two has
to be the winning ticket.

705
00:46:49,918 --> 00:46:51,487
[Time to check the lottery ticket.]

706
00:46:51,488 --> 00:46:53,364
- I see something.
- Really?

707
00:46:53,365 --> 00:46:55,919
- Dud.
- It's another dud.

708
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:57,261
[A dud!
Maybe the next ticket.]

709
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:02,097
- Can it be?
- No, it's another dud.

710
00:47:02,684 --> 00:47:05,178
[Another dud for the second ticket.]

711
00:47:07,150 --> 00:47:09,895
I'm sorry, but can you give me a shot
of air? I'm really hot right now.

712
00:47:11,157 --> 00:47:13,360
Okay, here's a shot of air.

713
00:47:21,355 --> 00:47:23,835
[I've never felt anything quite like it...]

714

Why was it shooting out water?
That was shooting out water.

715
00:47:34,913 --> 00:47:37,094
- Why was it shooting out water?
- Why was it shooting water?

716
00:47:37,095 --> 00:47:39,631
I don't know.
But that was a shot of water.

717
00:47:39,632 --> 00:47:41,136
[Is it supposed to be a shot of water?]

718
00:47:42,665 --> 00:47:44,974
It's his water bottle!

Seriously!
What are you doing!

720
00:47:48,989 --> 00:47:52,275
- What's wrong with you lately?
- You didn't know?

721
00:47:52,276 --> 00:47:54,537
You're acting like a kid!

722
00:47:54,538 --> 00:47:56,322
[I really didn't know...]

723
00:47:57,616 --> 00:48:00,759
One of these last two is
the winning ticket.

724
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:03,667
- It's either number two or three.
- Why don't you pick one, Ji Hyo?

725
00:48:03,668 --> 00:48:08,755
- She's lucky with things like that.

[The two must correctly answer the questions
simultaneously in order to win the mission.]

734

What is the gift that is most often bought
for any anniversary event?

741
00:48:56,304 --> 00:48:57,769
- Flowers!
- Flowers!

742
00:48:59,432 --> 00:49:01,406

The most desired location
to out on a date is?

00:49:06,531 --> 00:49:12,160
[If we get this question right,
then we can clear the mission...]

745
00:49:13,437 --> 00:49:14,807
One, two, three!

746
00:49:18,741 --> 00:49:21,001
[Fail]

747
00:49:22,001 --> 00:49:26,263
[Jung Suk and Min Ah fails the mission
so close to succeeding.]

748
00:49:26,660 --> 00:49:28,458
We were so close.

749
00:49:29,175 --> 00:49:31,683

- I...
- Well...

764
00:50:25,728 --> 00:50:27,601
You should've said, Joo Yoon Bal.

765
00:50:27,602 --> 00:50:31,041
- Was I supposed to name just one person?
- One specific person?

766
00:50:31,814 --> 00:50:33,475
One, two, three!

767
00:50:34,986 --> 00:50:40,407

[Fails at the final question.]

774
00:51:02,199 --> 00:51:04,505
You failed to answer
the last question correctly.

775
00:51:05,404 --> 00:51:09,016
[Third attempt-
Back to Jung Suk and Min Ah.]

776
00:51:09,017 --> 00:51:12,510

- Wow, that was so spot on.
- There wasn't even any hesitation.

781
00:51:22,263 --> 00:51:25,783
- I thought that was just one voice.
- Such a precise answer.

782
00:51:25,784 --> 00:51:27,398
Here's the next one.
Spice or fried?

- Spice!
- Spice!

784
00:51:30,804 --> 00:51:33,270
That was right.
They're good.

[Just one more question left to go.]

786
00:51:36,925 --> 00:51:39,650

Spicy or mild nanygmyun?

787
00:51:40,872 --> 00:51:42,718

- That's unbelievable.
- I can't believe they got that.

792
00:52:06,233 --> 00:52:07,796
[Time to check the lottery ticket.]

793
00:52:07,797 --> 00:52:11,536
Before you check the ticket,
know that it could be another dud.

794
00:52:11,537 --> 00:52:15,929
- Sit down and check the ticket.
- I see something red!

795
00:52:18,288 --> 00:52:21,893
- I see something.
- It's the winning ticket, isn't it?

[They're really giving it to us!]

801
00:52:41,408 --> 00:52:43,167
Are you really giving this to us?

802
00:52:43,168 --> 00:52:46,126
- It's for real.
- Why are they giving this to us?

803
00:52:46,127 --> 00:52:48,503
- Count the money.
- It really is three million Won.

- My family picked the winning ticket.
- Yes, that's correct.

808
00:53:00,542 --> 00:53:03,438

[Back to bickering over who brought
home the winning lottery ticket.]

- Are you disrespecting my family?
- Jong Kook.

811
00:53:12,911 --> 00:53:15,056

813
00:53:20,824 --> 00:53:23,650
- What a disrespectful family.
- I just called you by your name.

814
00:53:23,651 --> 00:53:26,206
[The two families are set on edge with
the lottery jackpot balanced on the line.]

815
00:53:27,127 --> 00:53:29,922
How did we get stuck with
a family like this?

816
00:53:29,923 --> 00:53:33,308
If it wasn't for Min Ah...

817
00:53:33,309 --> 00:53:36,683
You should be honored to have
become in-laws with our family.

818
00:53:36,684 --> 00:53:41,065
If you want to get fed,
you'd be wise to keep your mouths shut.

819
00:53:41,066 --> 00:53:44,292
My nickname is 'Lightning.'

820
00:53:44,890 --> 00:53:47,474
Maybe it's because you have lightning
fast family meetings all the time.

821
00:53:48,388 --> 00:53:51,324
[Our in-law is
the 'Lightning of Apgujeong.']

822
00:53:51,325 --> 00:53:53,931
My fist is lightning fast.

823
00:53:54,412 --> 00:54:00,561
[The conflict between these two families-
What fate lies ahead for this couple?]

824

[Chapter two-
Marriage, and the never-ending battle.]

825
00:54:12,454 --> 00:54:14,769
[Gyunggi Sungnam-si's Job World.]

826
00:54:16,552 --> 00:54:18,817
- That's a cake.
- Wow, it's a cake.

827
00:54:18,818 --> 00:54:23,475
[Is that a wedding cake?]

828
00:54:23,476 --> 00:54:26,315
It's time to give out the jackpot money.

829
00:54:26,316 --> 00:54:28,636
- But I do have an unfortunate bit of news.
- What is it?

830
00:54:28,637 --> 00:54:34,384
Only one person can take
the jackpot money home.

831
00:54:34,385 --> 00:54:36,337
Then I'll take care of managing
the money.

832
00:54:36,338 --> 00:54:38,883
- Yes, the man should take care of that.
- Listen to him, Min Ah.

833
00:54:38,884 --> 00:54:41,023
No, I want it.

834
00:54:41,024 --> 00:54:45,285
- No, I want it.
- She's suddenly being so aggressive.

835
00:54:45,286 --> 00:54:48,883
- She wasn't even saying anything...
- That's the loudest she's spoken all day.

836
00:54:48,884 --> 00:54:51,815
- She's suddenly being so aggressive.
- How are we going to do this?

837
00:54:51,816 --> 00:54:55,834
The man brings home the money, and the
woman is supposed to manage the money.

838
00:54:55,835 --> 00:54:59,619
- The woman is supposed to manage it.
- This family just doesn't get it.

839
00:55:00,401 --> 00:55:05,449
- You guys all have such nasty tempers.
- What an ignorant bunch of people.

840
00:55:05,450 --> 00:55:09,235
- What? Ignorant bunch of people?
- I'll teach all of you a lesson.

841
00:55:09,236 --> 00:55:13,037
- This wedding is nullified!
- I chose the winning ticket!

842
00:55:13,038 --> 00:55:16,263
[The family battle ensues.]

843
00:55:16,264 --> 00:55:19,187
We shouldn't even associate
ourselves with this family.

844
00:55:19,188 --> 00:55:22,764
- What an ignorant bunch of people.
- Can you help us do something about this?

845
00:55:23,555 --> 00:55:28,153
Since the two families and the couple
themselves can't come to an agreement

846
00:55:28,154 --> 00:55:31,971
the couple should split up and go to
their own respective families for now.

847
00:55:31,972 --> 00:55:34,292
[Everyone is to go back to
their own families.]

848
00:55:35,767 --> 00:55:37,907
Just take the money, Min Ah.
I don't want us to split up.

849
00:55:37,908 --> 00:55:39,508
- Really?
- No.

850
00:55:39,509 --> 00:55:42,995
- I'm going back to my own family.
- Come on, don't bother with them.

851
00:55:42,996 --> 00:55:49,136
[After their first quarrel over the money,
they each go back to their own family.]

852
00:55:49,137 --> 00:55:55,291
Ugh, Min Ah picked the wrong guy
from a very unsuitable family.

853
00:55:55,292 --> 00:55:56,901
What is it that you liked so
much about him?

854
00:55:56,902 --> 00:56:01,393
Our Min Ah was so focused on her work that
she never even got to experience dating.

855
00:56:01,394 --> 00:56:04,658
I took her back and forth to school
when she was a little girl.

856
00:56:04,982 --> 00:56:07,299
That's why I never even got to
go to school.

857
00:56:08,839 --> 00:56:10,713
- He's telling the truth.
- So that's what's wrong with you.

858
00:56:10,714 --> 00:56:13,518
[The sad truth behind the two twins.]

<i>Please take a look at the monitor
that's placed in front of you.</i>

861
00:56:29,034 --> 00:56:31,603
- Do you all see the board?
- Yes.

862
00:56:31,967 --> 00:56:39,105
<i>A variety of household items that belong in
those empty slots on the board are hidden</i>

863
00:56:39,106 --> 00:56:41,256
<i>throughout this building.</i>

864
00:56:41,704 --> 00:56:46,235
<i>You must find the hidden household
items that are hidden in this building</i>

865
00:56:46,236 --> 00:56:50,143
<i>and place it on top of the platform.</i>

866
00:56:52,275 --> 00:56:56,313
<i>Once the household items are
placed on top of the platform</i>

867
00:56:56,348 --> 00:57:02,873
<i>then the slot the item belongs in will light
up in the color of the team that found it.</i>

868
00:57:03,695 --> 00:57:08,396
<i>From the slot on the very bottom to
the heart that's on top of the cake</i>

869
00:57:08,397 --> 00:57:15,670
<i>the team that gets to that heart first
will get to keep the jackpot money.</i>

870
00:57:15,671 --> 00:57:18,305
- Okay, I get it.
- It's like filling up their hope chest.

871
00:57:18,306 --> 00:57:24,421
<i>Neither teams will know which item
will belong in which slot on the board.</i>

872
00:57:24,422 --> 00:57:28,768
<i>But the bride and the groom possess
the clue to that answer.</i>

873
00:57:28,769 --> 00:57:31,146
- Do you remember anything?
- No, I don't.

874
00:57:31,147 --> 00:57:33,111
Did they give you guys anything?

875
00:57:33,112 --> 00:57:35,641
<i>But the bride and the groom possess
the clue to that answer.</i>

876
00:57:35,642 --> 00:57:37,614
Didn't you say that you wrote
something down earlier?

877
00:57:37,615 --> 00:57:39,712
Did they give you anything?

878
00:57:39,713 --> 00:57:42,101
[The reason being...]

879
00:57:42,999 --> 00:57:50,123
[The newlyweds themselves wrote down what
they'd like to have for their new house.]

880
00:57:51,304 --> 00:57:57,371
<i>What they wrote down earlier matches
the placement of the items on the board.</i>

881
00:57:58,132 --> 00:58:03,300
- Do you remember what you wrote down?
- Gary's the one who wrote all that down.

882
00:58:04,100 --> 00:58:06,831
We're totally ruined!

883
00:58:06,832 --> 00:58:10,434
I know I wrote them down,
but I don't remember a single thing.

884
00:58:11,823 --> 00:58:14,151
But I can guarantee that Gary
doesn't remember what he wrote down.

885
00:58:14,152 --> 00:58:16,554
We didn't write anything down
in the top two slots.

886
00:58:16,555 --> 00:58:18,564
[But they weren't allowed to write
anything down in the top two slots.]

887
00:58:18,565 --> 00:58:23,517
[Meaning that these two slots are random
items that the newlyweds didn't choose.]

888
00:58:23,518 --> 00:58:26,301
- We chose a TV.
- This isn't about love.

889
00:58:26,302 --> 00:58:28,698
Of course it's not about love.
It's about money right now.

890
00:58:28,699 --> 00:58:33,320
I'm positive that Min Ah is only
thinking about money right now.

891

[Money distribution-

892
00:58:35,914 --> 00:58:39,552

895
00:58:44,086 --> 00:58:46,315
I know what items we picked,
but I don't remember where I placed them.

896
00:58:48,315 --> 00:58:51,015
Why did I allow myself to
be entranced by my bride?

897
00:58:51,016 --> 00:58:54,367
Vacuum, air conditioner, wall decor...

898

[Groom Gary is trying to jog his memory.]

899
00:58:55,421 --> 00:58:56,512

901
00:59:00,151 --> 00:59:02,407
Bedding.
There was bedding on that list, too.

<i>There's bedding on that list as well.</i>

903
00:59:04,956 --> 00:59:06,944
Okay, I got it.

904

- Jae Suk!

- Jung Suk!
- What is it?

913
00:59:32,494 --> 00:59:36,438
- Jong Kook! Come and help!
- What is it?

914
00:59:36,439 --> 00:59:37,647
[The in-laws are all flocking
towards Kwang Soo.]

915

[Attempts to hand off the
item to Min Ah.]

00:59:57,510 --> 00:59:59,655

- What the heck is that?

[Min Ah loses the strength in her legs
from the shock of seeing what it is.]

922

- Why did you deceive Min Ah?
- You deceived Min Ah?

923
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:13,848
Why are you deceiving your own
team member?

924
01:00:13,849 --> 01:00:19,133
[Giraffe tried to trick the opposing team,
but ended up deceiving Min Ah instead.]

[Even Jung Suk fell for the trick
and sped over to Kwang Soo.]

926

- What was that?

927

- Can you actually do that?
- What were you thinking?

928
01:00:31,447 --> 01:00:33,494
- Sorry, Min Ah.
- Seriously.

929
01:00:33,495 --> 01:00:36,653
She was taking such care with it, too.

[So... this is how you play the game?]

931
01:00:39,084 --> 01:00:40,813

[Jung Suk attempts to pry information out of
her by pretending to get her some water.]

938

A clothes' hangar?
You wrote down clothes hangar?

939
01:01:05,917 --> 01:01:10,252
- Why would you write down clothing hangar?
- We also wrote down a cat and a dog.

940
01:01:10,253 --> 01:01:12,183
Really?
What else?

941
01:01:12,558 --> 01:01:16,551
- A crab, and a lion.
- A crab and a lion?

to arrive at the platform.]

954
01:02:09,330 --> 01:02:11,397
Okay.

955
01:02:11,926 --> 01:02:14,261

[Which slot on the board
does the bidet belong in?]

957
01:02:19,203 --> 01:02:21,367
Okay, we found one!

[Groom's family takes the first slot.]

959
01:02:25,997 --> 01:02:27,958
We've got one.

960
01:02:30,244 --> 01:02:33,265
- Let's check this one out.
- No Way.

961
01:02:33,768 --> 01:02:36,471
Do you really need a horse mask
for a newlywed's home?

962
01:02:38,005 --> 01:02:40,029
[Did I not hear her right?]

963
01:02:40,030 --> 01:02:42,256
Is there an 'R' sticker on it?

964
01:02:42,257 --> 01:02:44,051
[Naive Jung Suk brought the horse mask
after fully trusting what Min Ah told him.]

965
01:02:44,052 --> 01:02:46,077
- It needs the 'R' sticker on it.
- What are you doing?

966
01:02:46,651 --> 01:02:50,909
- It needs the 'R' sticker on it.
- Did Min Ah lie to me?

967
01:02:50,910 --> 01:02:53,568
What's wrong with you?
Why are you so naive?

968
01:02:53,569 --> 01:02:56,116
The horse mask is not one of
the household items.

969
01:02:57,106 --> 01:03:00,509
[That Shin Min Ah...]

970
01:03:01,077 --> 01:03:03,658

for the needed household item.]

972
01:03:10,611 --> 01:03:12,383
The pumpkin?

973
01:03:12,384 --> 01:03:15,567
[Discovers the air conditioner
by pure chance.]

974
01:03:17,677 --> 01:03:19,885
It's the air conditioner.

975
01:03:19,886 --> 01:03:21,893
What do I do?

976
01:03:21,894 --> 01:03:24,783
[Kkuk is watching what's going on
from hiding.]

977
01:03:24,784 --> 01:03:27,717
Guys, come to the kid's center
for a minute.

978
01:03:28,780 --> 01:03:30,985
Come to the kid's center.

979
01:03:30,986 --> 01:03:35,209
- Guys, come to the kid's center.
- Jae Suk, come to the kid's center quick.

980
01:03:35,210 --> 01:03:37,768
- The kid's center.
- Jae Suk, I found the air conditioner.

981
01:03:37,769 --> 01:03:40,689
- That big thing over there?
- Jae Suk, come to the kid's center now!

982
01:03:40,690 --> 01:03:43,403
Wow, that big thing?
Is there an 'R' sticker on it?

983
01:03:43,404 --> 01:03:46,397
- It's mine.
- Let me just see what it looks like.

984
01:03:46,398 --> 01:03:49,043
- I bought it and left it here.
- Let me just take a look at it.

985
01:03:49,421 --> 01:03:51,623
I just need one of you guys
to come to the kid's center.

986
01:03:51,624 --> 01:03:55,004
- Where's the kid's center?
- Is that on the first floor?

987
01:03:55,005 --> 01:03:57,981
- I need one of my people to come here.
- Over here, Jae Suk.

988
01:03:58,521 --> 01:04:00,733
- Why did so many of you come?
- Where is it?

989
01:04:00,734 --> 01:04:03,237
Why is there an army of you?

990
01:04:03,238 --> 01:04:05,761
[The key point of the weaker team
is that they travel in a pack.]

991
01:04:06,580 --> 01:04:08,582
We need to get this out of here
before the other team arrives.

992
01:04:08,583 --> 01:04:11,642
Is it the air conditioner?
How are we going to get this out of here?

993
01:04:11,677 --> 01:04:16,595
- They just found an air conditioner.
- I found something else that's really good.

994
01:04:16,596 --> 01:04:19,816
[While Ha Ha brags to Jong Kook and
tries to elicit a compliment from him...]

995
01:04:19,817 --> 01:04:22,321
- Stay down here, Ji Hyo.
- Come, hurry!

996
01:04:22,322 --> 01:04:25,272
- We need to go now!
- Now's our chance!

997
01:04:27,979 --> 01:04:31,015
[But why is Ji Hyo carrying the heavy
item with the three men around?]

998
01:04:31,016 --> 01:04:32,837
Put it up there.

999
01:04:32,838 --> 01:04:34,806
- There you go.
- Come here.

1000
01:04:35,461 --> 01:04:38,363
Ugh, it's right there?

1001
01:04:38,364 --> 01:04:40,701
No, never mind.
They already got it.

1002
01:04:41,641 --> 01:04:43,895
They already got it.

1003
01:04:43,896 --> 01:04:46,141
[Where does the air conditioner
belong on the board?]

1004
01:04:47,407 --> 01:04:49,580
- Nice, it's right in the middle.
- That's a good spot.

1005
01:04:49,581 --> 01:04:52,193
Okay, let's go.

1006
01:04:53,652 --> 01:04:54,852
Good job.

1007
01:04:54,852 --> 01:04:57,528
[Both the Groom and the Bride's side
of the family each got one item.]

1008
01:04:59,720 --> 01:05:02,061
[Hello, my husband.]

1009
01:05:02,062 --> 01:05:04,752
Hi, I feel myself melting
at your smile again.

1010
01:05:04,753 --> 01:05:08,356
- Do you remember anything?
- No, I don't.

1011
01:05:08,357 --> 01:05:11,657
[Still remaining sweet even though they're
split up by their family's bitter feud.]

1012
01:05:11,658 --> 01:05:13,635
- You wrote everything down.
- But I don't remember anything either.

1013
01:05:13,636 --> 01:05:18,179
Even though we're split up now,
we're getting back together, aren't we?

1014
01:05:18,180 --> 01:05:23,344
- Of course, we're getting back together.
- Then if you could tell me where...

1015
01:05:23,345 --> 01:05:28,147
But Min Ah, I really don't remember anything.
I didn't even remember the items.

1016
01:05:28,637 --> 01:05:31,464
- What did we write down again?
- Clothes hangers.

1017
01:05:32,035 --> 01:05:34,384
Clothes hangers?
No, there wasn't.

1018
01:05:34,943 --> 01:05:37,695
- Are you trying to deceive me right now?
- No, I'm not.

1019
01:05:37,696 --> 01:05:42,775
You told naive Jung Suk that
the horse mask was on the list.

1020
01:05:42,776 --> 01:05:45,617
Do you know how much he ran around
with that horse mask in hand?

1021
01:05:46,162 --> 01:05:48,326
- I really don't remember anything.
- Why did you tell him that?

1022
01:05:48,327 --> 01:05:51,703
- What would you need a horse mask for?
- I don't remember writing that down.

1023
01:05:51,704 --> 01:05:55,452
- I'm sure that there were clothes hangers.
- No, we didn't choose any clothes hangers.

1024
01:05:55,453 --> 01:05:58,714
- You're a very strange one.
- Knife and cutting board...

1025
01:05:58,715 --> 01:06:02,545
Knife and cutting board?
Jong Kook, we didn't pick those items.

1026
01:06:03,395 --> 01:06:06,427
- She's very strange.
- She's actually lying to me now.

1027
01:06:06,428 --> 01:06:07,937
I didn't take her to be like that.

1028
01:06:09,340 --> 01:06:11,250
I don't remember.

1029
01:06:11,251 --> 01:06:13,130
Knife?

1030
01:06:13,131 --> 01:06:15,318
I don't even remember what I chose.

1031
01:06:15,319 --> 01:06:18,326
[Min Ah wasn't lying,
she really just doesn't remember.]

1032
01:06:19,688 --> 01:06:22,749
[In her search for
the knife and the cutting board...]

1033
01:06:22,750 --> 01:06:26,759
[She finds the toaster by pure luck.]

1034
01:06:29,571 --> 01:06:32,482
I need someone to
come down to the restaurant.

1035
01:06:33,861 --> 01:06:35,591
[Just then...]

1036
01:06:35,592 --> 01:06:38,625
[Groom Gary finds the coffee pot.]

1037
01:06:38,626 --> 01:06:40,771
I found the coffee pot.

1038
01:06:40,772 --> 01:06:42,490
I don't see anyone.
Hurry!

1039
01:06:42,491 --> 01:06:44,619
[Off towards the platform!]

1040
01:06:46,018 --> 01:06:49,265
[Groom's family- Coffee pot.]

1041
01:06:49,266 --> 01:06:52,154
[Bride's family- Toaster.]

1042
01:06:52,155 --> 01:06:56,229
Please, let it be this one or that one.
I need one of those slots.

1043
01:06:59,053 --> 01:07:05,147
[Groom's family- The bidet and
the coffeepot are a direct link!]

1044
01:07:07,553 --> 01:07:10,039
- Okay, that's a nice line.
- Okay, we're good.

1045
01:07:10,040 --> 01:07:11,980
[The Bride's family is also
heading in the right direction.]

1046
01:07:11,981 --> 01:07:14,242
- Let's go, party time.
- You did good.

1047
01:07:14,243 --> 01:07:17,952
- We've got two now.
- I still haven't even seen anything.

1048
01:07:19,947 --> 01:07:21,999
I see another lit up slot.

1049
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,611
Gary, there's another pink light.

1050
01:07:24,612 --> 01:07:28,144
- Which direction is their line headed?
- Over here at the end.

1051
01:07:28,145 --> 01:07:31,069
- So they're not in a good spot?
- The two slots aren't connected.

1052
01:07:31,070 --> 01:07:34,687
We need one of the two slots
up at the top.

1053
01:07:36,395 --> 01:07:38,563
Let's just face it head on.

1054
01:07:41,407 --> 01:07:43,154
- Suk Jin.
- Yeah?

1055
01:07:43,155 --> 01:07:45,059
Come here, Ha Ha.

1056
01:07:45,060 --> 01:07:47,440
[The 'R' sticker...]

1057
01:07:47,441 --> 01:07:51,456
[Attempted to go head on with the sticker
stuck to the front of the bathrobe.]

1058
01:07:51,457 --> 01:07:53,631
[Run and escape.]

1059
01:07:53,632 --> 01:07:56,552
- Come up to the top, Kwang Soo!
- Where?

1060
01:07:56,553 --> 01:07:58,448
Where?

1061
01:07:58,449 --> 01:08:01,096
- Where?
- Suk Jin, where are you?

1062
01:08:01,928 --> 01:08:04,096
Are you looking for me?

1063
01:08:04,097 --> 01:08:07,927
This is really important, but no one's...
Come down here!

1064
01:08:08,907 --> 01:08:11,423
The Blue Team only needs two more
in order to win!

1065
01:08:12,483 --> 01:08:16,132
[It's a total war up on the second floor.]

1066
01:08:17,813 --> 01:08:21,577
[The bathrobe model is surrounded
by a band of opponents.]

1067
01:08:21,578 --> 01:08:23,173
Hurry up and get here!

1068
01:08:26,703 --> 01:08:30,274
- Stop tickling me.
- Excuse me, In-law.

1069
01:08:30,275 --> 01:08:32,679
- What?
- What you're doing now...

1070
01:08:32,680 --> 01:08:35,421
They just need to find two more
before they win!

1071
01:08:35,422 --> 01:08:37,096
Everyone come down to the first floor!

1072
01:08:37,652 --> 01:08:40,895
- No, you can't take it!
- Let's try to talk this out.

1073
01:08:40,896 --> 01:08:43,148
[Jung Suk and Gary each take
one person to block off.]

1074
01:08:43,149 --> 01:08:45,705
[Kkuk is busy spinning Big-nose around.]

1075
01:08:50,854 --> 01:08:52,909
[Kkuk succeeds in stealing
the bathrobe away.]

1076
01:08:53,329 --> 01:08:55,187
Jong Kook!

1077
01:08:57,609 --> 01:09:00,525
[After catching the robe,
Jung Suk sprints for the platform.]

1078
01:09:01,857 --> 01:09:04,071
It's off to the left!

1079
01:09:06,669 --> 01:09:09,856
[Succeeds in planting the robe
on top of the platform.]

1080
01:09:11,361 --> 01:09:14,798
[If one of these two slots lights up,
then they are almost to their victory!]

1081
01:09:14,799 --> 01:09:17,501
[But unfortunately lands in
a disadvantageous spot.]

1082
01:09:18,377 --> 01:09:20,925
If it had been one of these spots...

1083
01:09:20,926 --> 01:09:23,464
We just need one of those two slots.

1084
01:09:23,465 --> 01:09:25,372
What the heck?

1085
01:09:25,766 --> 01:09:28,666
We have to find the middle one.

1086
01:09:28,667 --> 01:09:31,281
You're all dead if you don't answer this.

1087
01:09:32,315 --> 01:09:33,961
- Hey.
- Jae Suk.

1088
01:09:33,962 --> 01:09:36,674
- What are you doing instead of searching.
- Listen to me.

1089
01:09:36,675 --> 01:09:40,122
I've been wanting you to come down here.
We have to find the middle one.

1090
01:09:40,123 --> 01:09:42,500
You have to remember this
and we need to find the one in the middle.

1091
01:09:42,501 --> 01:09:45,295
Are you going to keep staying down here
or are you going to start searching?

1092
01:09:45,296 --> 01:09:47,491
I'm telling you a very important
piece of information right now.

1093
01:09:49,147 --> 01:09:51,725
<i>I placed a flower basket
on top of the platform.</i>

1094
01:09:51,726 --> 01:09:53,179
We have to find the rest.

1095
01:09:53,180 --> 01:10:03,150
[The Groom's family successfully finds
the flower pot and the rice cooker.]

1096
01:10:05,227 --> 01:10:08,293
- Have you found anything?
- No, I don't remember anything.

1097
01:10:08,294 --> 01:10:10,665
- Kwang Soo, have you found anything?
- No, nothing.

1098
01:10:10,666 --> 01:10:14,564
- What's the last thing we wrote down?
- The bathrobe.

1099
01:10:14,565 --> 01:10:17,372
- Kwang Soo?
- But the bathrobe's already been found.

1100
01:10:17,373 --> 01:10:19,829
- No, I don't see anything.
- Come on, Gary.

1101
01:10:19,830 --> 01:10:21,992
[Meanwhile, Kwang Soo starts searching
through one of the stores.]

1102
01:10:28,887 --> 01:10:31,073
[That's a mini-fridge!]

1103
01:10:31,074 --> 01:10:33,693
Why? Why are you
suddenly looking at me like that?

1104
01:10:33,694 --> 01:10:36,186
- We need to talk.
- What do you want to talk about?

1105
01:10:36,187 --> 01:10:37,796
We...

1106
01:10:38,769 --> 01:10:44,023
[Even though you've lied to me,
you're still so pretty...]

1107
01:10:44,722 --> 01:10:47,874
[Gary's body and heart are being
pulled by Min Ah's lure.]

1108
01:10:52,269 --> 01:10:54,697
[Kwang Soo takes advantage of the
moment and runs away with the fridge.]

1109
01:10:54,698 --> 01:10:56,328
Lee Kwang Soo!

1110
01:10:57,359 --> 01:10:59,192
It's the fridge!

1111
01:10:59,193 --> 01:11:03,011
[While Gary was entranced by Min Ah...
Kwang Soo makes a touchdown.]

1112
01:11:09,634 --> 01:11:12,872
[Speechless...]

1113
01:11:12,873 --> 01:11:15,454
That's why it's so crucial for
a man to meet a good woman.

1114
01:11:20,158 --> 01:11:22,639
We need to just follow the line.

1115
01:11:23,516 --> 01:11:27,642
[The Bride's family fortunately found an item
that's directly connected to their slot.]

1116
01:11:28,158 --> 01:11:30,898
- This would be three.
- We don't have time for this right now.

1117
01:11:31,712 --> 01:11:34,338
Why do they always tell me that
whenever I try to do something?

1118
01:11:34,339 --> 01:11:38,008
- What's wrong?
- I fell for a girl's spell again.

1119
01:11:38,043 --> 01:11:41,052
- What did you do that for?
- I really may have lovesickness.

1120
01:11:41,053 --> 01:11:43,026
What's wrong with you?

1121
01:11:43,027 --> 01:11:45,727
[The undeniable pull of the bride, Min Ah.]

1122
01:11:46,582 --> 01:11:50,146
You try approaching her and
see if you can resist her charms.

1123
01:11:50,544 --> 01:11:54,750
- Don't even stand close to her.
- I keep melting around her.

1124
01:11:54,751 --> 01:11:57,113
I become a melted puddle
of chocolate.

1125
01:11:58,636 --> 01:12:02,432
She's like a chocolate factory.

1126
01:12:02,433 --> 01:12:03,944
[You're my very own chocolate factory.]

1127
01:12:10,838 --> 01:12:14,423
[Bride's family still needs three,
and the Groom's family needs two slots.]

1128
01:12:15,032 --> 01:12:17,260
[That's a mini-car!]

1129
01:12:18,028 --> 01:12:21,812
[Kwang Soo makes a run for it after making
sure that the 'R' sticker is on it.]

1130
01:12:21,813 --> 01:12:24,182
Lee Kwang Soo!

1131
01:12:25,082 --> 01:12:28,296
[Household items hunters barrage in.]

1132
01:12:28,297 --> 01:12:29,989
- Where?
- Over here!

1133
01:12:29,990 --> 01:12:33,196
- Go, Kwang Soo!
- Jae Suk!

1134
01:12:34,966 --> 01:12:38,443
[Passes it off to Jae Suk.]

1135
01:12:39,267 --> 01:12:41,923
[The bride tosses out some action moves.]

1136
01:12:41,924 --> 01:12:44,645
- Hurry!
- Where is it?

1137
01:12:45,495 --> 01:12:48,485
[Yoo Hyuk is blocked off by the Groom's
family in front of the platform.]

1138
01:12:48,486 --> 01:12:52,599
- Min Ah.
- Min Ah! Don't lose it to them!

1139
01:12:52,634 --> 01:12:54,244
Where is it?

1140
01:12:54,245 --> 01:12:56,442
[Min Ah stays on her path.]

1141
01:12:57,717 --> 01:12:59,542
Jong Kook.

1142
01:13:01,672 --> 01:13:04,337
[Jae Suk immobilizes Jung Suk.]

1143
01:13:04,338 --> 01:13:06,509
Hurry while I've got Jung Suk.

1144
01:13:06,510 --> 01:13:10,106
[Min Ah succeeds in making her touchdown.]

1145
01:13:12,073 --> 01:13:20,056
[The unlisted min-car belongs to
one of the top two slots!]

1146
01:13:20,057 --> 01:13:22,712
What do we still have left to find?

1147
01:13:22,713 --> 01:13:26,786
[Both the families only has two more
slots left to find.]

1148
01:13:27,905 --> 01:13:29,505
Where did you find that?

1149
01:13:29,506 --> 01:13:33,935
[Bride's family soon thereafter
finds the old TV.]

1150
01:13:33,936 --> 01:13:37,267
[Groom's family finds the plunger.]

1151
01:13:37,268 --> 01:13:40,561
- When did you write this down?
- Are you angry?

1152
01:13:40,562 --> 01:13:43,043
I didn't write the mini-car down either.

1153
01:13:43,044 --> 01:13:45,509
We just need one more, right?

1154
01:13:45,510 --> 01:13:47,725
[Where does the recently found TV belong?]

1155
01:13:47,726 --> 01:13:50,615
[Just where they need it to be!]

1156
01:13:50,616 --> 01:13:53,832
- We just need to find one more.
- Tell everyone that we already found it.

1157
01:13:54,470 --> 01:13:56,258
[Where does the Groom's plunger belong?]

1158
01:13:56,259 --> 01:14:01,526
[At the very top spot!]

1159
01:14:02,197 --> 01:14:05,425
But the other team just needs to find
one more in order to win.

1160
01:14:06,085 --> 01:14:10,137
[It's down to one last item
for both the teams!]

1161
01:14:10,495 --> 01:14:15,441
Ji Hyo and Min Ah...
we only have one more left to find.

1162
01:14:15,442 --> 01:14:17,329
Tell them that I found the last one.

1163
01:14:22,857 --> 01:14:26,421
<i>Breaking news.</i>

1164
01:14:26,422 --> 01:14:29,702
<i>The searching time will soon
come to a close</i>

1165
01:14:29,703 --> 01:14:32,864
<i>and we will now reveal the items needed
for the still missing slots on the board.</i>

1166
01:14:33,394 --> 01:14:34,901
They're going to tell us.

1167
01:14:36,354 --> 01:14:42,819
[The items needed for the empty slots
on the board will now be revealed.]

1168
01:14:42,820 --> 01:14:44,675
<i>Please check and find the
items needed.</i>

1169
01:14:45,131 --> 01:14:50,037
[All they have left to do now is to find
the items still needed on the board!]

1170
01:14:50,038 --> 01:14:52,154
We need to find the bedding.

1171
01:14:53,389 --> 01:14:57,521
- Bedding?
- We just need to find the bedding.

1172
01:14:57,522 --> 01:15:01,863
[Bride's family- Bedding.
Groom's family- Vacuum.]

1173
01:15:01,864 --> 01:15:06,276
[Must find their item before
the opposing team finds theirs!]

1174
01:15:06,277 --> 01:15:08,296
Where am I going to find the bedding?

1175
01:15:08,754 --> 01:15:11,735
Bedding, bedding, bedding...

1176
01:15:11,736 --> 01:15:14,119
I just need someone to respond.

1177
01:15:14,120 --> 01:15:16,666
Is anyone even listening to me?
Bedding.

1178
01:15:16,667 --> 01:15:18,946
Rip up the bedding to shreds.

1179
01:15:18,947 --> 01:15:19,992
[It all comes down to this one moment.]

1180
01:15:19,993 --> 01:15:22,913
What do you want to do, Jung Suk?
Want to split up the money in half?

1181
01:15:23,883 --> 01:15:26,844
[Anxious Bride's desperate offer.]

1182
01:15:27,554 --> 01:15:29,706
- Are you being serious?
- But you have to help me find the bedding.

1183
01:15:29,707 --> 01:15:33,177
- But you can't betray me.
- I'd never betray you.

1184
01:15:33,663 --> 01:15:36,368
Bedding... where's the bedding?

1185
01:15:36,369 --> 01:15:46,296
[Bedding... and vacuum...
Where are you guys?]

1186
01:15:46,297 --> 01:15:47,958
I really want to find it.

1187
01:15:52,422 --> 01:15:55,701
[Is that a vacuum in Jung Suk's hand?]

1188
01:15:59,565 --> 01:16:03,892
- The Blue Team's found it.
- The Blue Team's found it!

1189
01:16:04,920 --> 01:16:07,919
- Where, Ji Hyo?
- Where are they?

1190
01:16:08,461 --> 01:16:11,826
Jung Suk, run!
No, not that way!

1191
01:16:14,413 --> 01:16:18,066
[A full on chase.]

1192
01:16:18,067 --> 01:16:21,571
- Run!
- We have to stop him.

1193
01:16:25,632 --> 01:16:29,545
[Jung Suk gets caught by
the Yoo-Lee brothers.]

1194
01:16:29,546 --> 01:16:31,769
I have to take it from you
no matter what.

1195
01:16:33,015 --> 01:16:36,833
Come on, let me just take it.
I really want to do it!

1196
01:16:36,834 --> 01:16:38,970
I want to get it up on the platform.

1197
01:16:42,719 --> 01:16:45,326
[Blank Ji snatches the vacuum away.]

1198
01:16:46,638 --> 01:16:48,504
- Ji Hyo, get it on the platform.
- Get it up there!

1199
01:16:51,613 --> 01:16:53,517
Hurry up and get it up there.

1200
01:16:53,518 --> 01:16:55,596
- Did you get it?
- I got it!

1201
01:16:56,953 --> 01:16:59,643
Ugh, we lost.

1202
01:17:00,505 --> 01:17:01,851
[But...]

1203
01:17:01,852 --> 01:17:05,191
That vacuum doesn't have
the 'R' sticker on it.

1204
01:17:05,840 --> 01:17:08,474
[What?]

1205
01:17:14,014 --> 01:17:16,158
- I totally faked them.
- You faked them?

1206
01:17:16,159 --> 01:17:22,363
[Naive Jung Suk's
completely unexpected trickery!]

1207
01:17:26,615 --> 01:17:29,003
How could you have lied to me?

1208
01:17:34,019 --> 01:17:36,471
You must be really tired
with all my running around.

1209
01:17:37,374 --> 01:17:41,722
- I feel like I'm running too fast.
- Thanks to you, we're getting a workout.

1210
01:17:41,723 --> 01:17:43,176
Really?

1211
01:17:43,177 --> 01:17:44,707
In that case...

1212
01:17:47,192 --> 01:17:49,281
I'm just kidding.

1213
01:17:58,728 --> 01:18:01,360
Kwang Soo, I'm so tired.

1214
01:18:01,361 --> 01:18:04,958
[Unable to recover after the trickery
that Jung Suk played on them.]

1215
01:18:04,959 --> 01:18:07,380
- I'm so tired.
- The bedding...

1216
01:18:07,986 --> 01:18:10,102
The bedding...

1217
01:18:10,103 --> 01:18:12,917
The vacuum has to be
around here somewhere.

1218
01:18:12,918 --> 01:18:21,330
[Will it be the vacuum or
the bedding first?]

1219
01:18:21,331 --> 01:18:26,474
[The final search is on
for the jackpot cash.]

1220
01:18:29,425 --> 01:18:32,498
[It's the real vacuum!]

1221
01:18:33,826 --> 01:18:37,590
[Must lure the opposing team's attention
away to another direction.]

1222
01:18:37,591 --> 01:18:40,259
- We need to find Dong Hoon.
- There he is over there.

1223
01:18:41,355 --> 01:18:43,254
- No, it's a fake.
- We've already been fooled once.

1224
01:18:43,255 --> 01:18:44,798
[We're not going to be fooled again.]

1225
01:18:45,185 --> 01:18:52,675
[But the Giraffe is fooled once again,
and the Bride runs over to join in.]

1226
01:18:52,676 --> 01:18:54,971
- Kwang Soo, you need to...
- Take his walkie-talkie.

1227
01:18:55,851 --> 01:18:59,200
[While Ha Ha's busy keeping Kwang Soo
distracted with the twin story...]

1228
01:19:00,998 --> 01:19:03,582
[Gary also discovers the vacuum.]

1229
01:19:06,467 --> 01:19:08,978
- What's going on with Dong Hoon?
- Hurry, Dong Hoon!

1230
01:19:08,979 --> 01:19:12,122
[After directing everyone over
to Ha Ha for distraction...]

1231
01:19:12,123 --> 01:19:14,156
Jong Kook, I found it.

1232
01:19:14,157 --> 01:19:17,331
- I just saw it.
- Do you have it?

1233
01:19:18,680 --> 01:19:22,278
[The Groom's team must carefully devise
a plan to get the item.]

1234
01:19:23,537 --> 01:19:25,954
I think the other team has
found something.

1235
01:19:26,568 --> 01:19:29,102
They would've taken it already
if they had found something.

1236
01:19:29,103 --> 01:19:33,289
- I think that was a lie.
- He could be faking it.

1237
01:19:37,677 --> 01:19:40,864
[Can't be...]

1238
01:19:43,591 --> 01:19:46,233
[It looks like bedding of some sort...]

1239
01:19:52,678 --> 01:19:56,535
[Gary seizes his chance and
grabs the vacuum.]

1240
01:19:56,536 --> 01:19:59,303
- Gary has something behind his back.
- Hurry, Jong Kook!

1241
01:19:59,304 --> 01:20:01,069
[Takes off full speed ahead.]

1242
01:20:03,521 --> 01:20:05,963
[It's their bedding!]

1243
01:20:05,964 --> 01:20:08,643
[Jae Suk also takes off for the platform.]

1244
01:20:09,356 --> 01:20:14,331
[Both team's final sprint.]

1245
01:20:17,642 --> 01:20:24,220
[Who will be the first
to get to the platform?]

1246
01:20:25,889 --> 01:20:39,153
[Who will be the one to take
the winning jackpot home?]

1247
01:20:41,405 --> 01:20:46,955
[Household Item Race-
The board game is now over.]

1248
01:20:47,848 --> 01:20:49,656
It's now time for the final reveal.

1249
01:20:49,657 --> 01:20:51,967
The team that lights up
the heart is the winner?

1250
01:20:53,202 --> 01:20:54,614
Please...

1251
01:20:55,378 --> 01:21:03,880
[Which team's line
will reach the heart first?]

1252
01:21:05,303 --> 01:21:10,793
[The Groom's vacuum was first to light up.]

1253
01:21:17,375 --> 01:21:20,585
[Succeeds in connecting all the slots!]

1254
01:21:20,586 --> 01:21:25,245
[Groom's family wins the race!]

1255
01:21:26,945 --> 01:21:29,481
- But the heart is cracked in half.
- It's okay.

1256
01:21:31,431 --> 01:21:35,842
- Your love is shattered.
- Our families are now sworn enemies.

1257
01:21:35,843 --> 01:21:37,671
[The in-law's relationship is
worsened even more by this debacle.]

1258
01:21:41,215 --> 01:21:43,900
That's Gary's win.

1259
01:21:43,901 --> 01:21:47,688
[Groom Gary to take the jackpot cash.]

1260
01:21:47,689 --> 01:21:51,337
- I feel so bad for our Min Ah.
- Just give me 30,000 Won.

1261
01:21:52,153 --> 01:21:54,878
- Just be patient.
- What are you going to do with 30,000 Won?

1262
01:21:54,879 --> 01:21:57,159
We need some cab fare.

1263
01:21:57,160 --> 01:22:04,523
Gary, do you want to share the winning cash
with the members of your family?

1264
01:22:04,524 --> 01:22:07,499
Of course, he does.
Don't try to make us feel nervous about it.

1265
01:22:08,408 --> 01:22:12,445
- The decision is up to you.
- It's real money, isn't it?

1266
01:22:12,446 --> 01:22:16,137
- With your family members...
- Say your closing remarks right now.

1267
01:22:16,138 --> 01:22:19,051
You can split the money
with your family...

1268
01:22:19,052 --> 01:22:22,388
- Or you can even keep it all to yourself.
- Seriously?

1269
01:22:22,389 --> 01:22:26,863
- Also, with the woman you once loved...
- Ji Hyo?

1270
01:22:27,430 --> 01:22:31,302
[Gary also has the option of sharing it with
Min Ah, and reconciling with her.]

1271
01:22:31,303 --> 01:22:34,222
Even if you do reconcile with her,
it's all over once the cameras are off.

1272
01:22:34,223 --> 01:22:37,402
- Wait, I need to think.
- Min Ah won't be back next week.

1273
01:22:37,403 --> 01:22:39,624
Get yourself together!

1274
01:22:39,625 --> 01:22:43,699
- You have to think about this.
- We're ready to welcome Husband Gae.

1275
01:22:43,700 --> 01:22:46,534
Don't put on the cutesy act
right now!

1276
01:22:46,535 --> 01:22:49,976
[The Groom's resolve is shaking with
the Bride's cute little show.]

1277
01:22:49,977 --> 01:22:51,792
She's putting on her cute act.

1278
01:22:53,400 --> 01:22:57,895
[The Bride's family is trying to convince
Gary by singing him a song of sweet love.]

1279
01:22:57,896 --> 01:23:00,772
- No, don't do this to me.
- Get yourself together!

1280
01:23:00,773 --> 01:23:03,640
- Get yourself together!
- Get yourself together!

1281
01:23:04,939 --> 01:23:07,212
[Honey...]

1282
01:23:07,213 --> 01:23:09,491
- Get away!
- Min Ah.

1283
01:23:10,446 --> 01:23:12,346
One...

1284
01:23:12,347 --> 01:23:16,436
[What will Gary choose?]

1285
01:23:16,437 --> 01:23:20,864
[Will it be family, money, or love?]

1286
01:23:20,865 --> 01:23:25,932
I'm going to share this money with my bride.

1287
01:23:25,933 --> 01:23:29,706
[Groom Gary, chooses his bride, Min Ah.]

1288
01:23:34,770 --> 01:23:37,172
We sweated and toiled
for you all day!

1289
01:23:37,173 --> 01:23:41,170
[His beautiful bride takes priority
over his own brothers.]

1290
01:23:43,750 --> 01:23:45,816
[A ring to symbolize their reconciliation
for the bride and the groom.]

1291
01:23:45,817 --> 01:23:47,952
Look at how shameless she is to stick
