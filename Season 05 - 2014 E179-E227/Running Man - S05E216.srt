[Another hero begins to stir...]

Stop pretending to be asleep.

18
00:02:16,186 --> 00:02:20,332
- Ugh, seriously.
- That was a nice, long nap.

19
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,348
- Wonderwoman!
- Superwoman!

20

- How am I a Superwoman?
- I mean, Superman!

21

shut me in there?

26

- Wow, he looks like the real Avatar.

00:03:46,276 --> 00:03:49,888
[May look like Sun Oh Gong,
but acts like Sa Oh Jung.]

42
00:03:49,889 --> 00:03:51,518
Who's he supposed to be?

43
00:03:52,181 --> 00:03:54,342
Is he Hong Gil Dong?

44
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:01,873
It's Hong Gil Dong!

45

[The last and the final hero who throws
the others into a state of fear.]

46

[No, he's not Elvis Presley.]

51
00:04:28,917 --> 00:04:34,255
- He never changes.
- I'm the oldest out of everyone here.

52
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:36,860
I don't even know how old I am.
I'm from another planet.

53
00:04:36,861 --> 00:04:39,693
- I'm the richest one here.
- I'm the tallest one here.

54
00:04:39,694 --> 00:04:41,588
- I'm a monkey.
- You're a monkey.

55
00:04:41,589 --> 00:04:45,720
- Why am I not human?
- Let's get out of here and get some air.

56
00:04:45,721 --> 00:04:47,529
I'm going to fly out of here.

57
00:04:51,789 --> 00:04:54,972
[But none of these heroes are able to fly,
and they seem to be rather powerless...]

58
00:04:54,973 --> 00:04:57,717

any special powers.

59

- I will show...
- What is he doing?

60

- What is he doing?
- What was that?

61
00:05:03,087 --> 00:05:04,765
- What are you doing?
- Are you trying to fly?

62
00:05:04,766 --> 00:05:06,836
Doing that usually drills
a hole into the ground.

63
00:05:06,837 --> 00:05:09,341
All of my powers have disappeared.

64
00:05:10,146 --> 00:05:13,294
These are supposed to be knife-like claws,
but they've been turned into wooden sticks.

65
00:05:13,295 --> 00:05:15,568
- See?
- That feels good, like a back scratcher!

66
00:05:15,569 --> 00:05:18,002
- Really?
- Hey, scratch my back, too!

67
00:05:18,003 --> 00:05:20,158
- Okay.
- What happened here?

68

Kwang-vatar.

80
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:52,643
If you're able to see me right now

81
00:05:52,644 --> 00:05:56,463
then it must mean that you've been
awakened from your frozen state.

82
00:05:56,464 --> 00:06:02,806
I bet you've noticed something unusual.
I've rid all of you of your super powers.

83
00:06:02,807 --> 00:06:04,020
Darn you!

84
00:06:04,021 --> 00:06:08,264
You now look like heroes
only from the outside.

85
00:06:08,265 --> 00:06:11,179
- You will not get away with this.
- We don't really look like it either.

86
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:18,221
In ten hours, the meteor that's carrying all
your superpowers will fall down on Korea.

87
00:06:18,222 --> 00:06:22,888
[The meteor carrying their superpowers
will land on Korea in ten hours.]

88
00:06:22,889 --> 00:06:29,162
You may regain your superpowers by finding
out where the meteor will crash in ten hours.

89
00:06:29,163 --> 00:06:31,548
- No!
- Do you want to get punched?

90

[Only one place where
they can regain their powers.]

91
00:06:36,692 --> 00:06:40,879
[They must find out where that is!]

92
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:46,073
Do you believe that you will be able to
find and regain your superpowers?

93
00:06:48,946 --> 00:06:54,400
And... Kwang-vatar.
I want only you to step forward.

94
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:57,864
- I want only you to step forward.
- What have you done now?

95
00:06:57,865 --> 00:07:00,627
- What did you do, Kwang-vatar?
- Step forward.

96
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:03,799
- You're up to something, aren't you?
- I'm not doing anything.

97
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,535
Did you plan all this?
Are you the anti-hero?

98
00:07:06,536 --> 00:07:09,211
Those aren't Kwang-vatar's ears.

99
00:07:09,212 --> 00:07:12,377
- What are they?
- They're some fake ears.

100
00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:15,539
I really haven't been able to hear
anything that you guys have been saying.

101
00:07:20,311 --> 00:07:23,709
<i>The way for you to regain
your superpowers are...</i>

102
00:07:29,854 --> 00:07:31,497
What are his superpowers?
It's just his tall height, right?

103
00:07:31,498 --> 00:07:35,227
- He's strength, I think. What did you hear?
- He falls in love at the end.

104
00:07:35,228 --> 00:07:37,664
- No, I didn't.
- You didn't hear anything?

105
00:07:38,096 --> 00:07:41,254
- I did, but I don't think it's important.
- You can't tell us about it, can you?

106
00:07:41,255 --> 00:07:44,289
I will make you pay, Kwang-vatar,
as soon as I get my powers back.

107
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:47,258
Isn't his comment about how it's
not that important just absurd?

108
00:07:47,782 --> 00:07:51,181
- We don't believe you.
- Don't say things like that.

109

[What message was Kwang-vatar
given from the Anti-hero?]

110

[A challenging hero mission that only
the truest of all heroes can pass.]

111

[Find the unknown location and regain powers
by completing various heroic missions.]

112
00:08:16,608 --> 00:08:19,274
[Kwang-vatar is very quick to adapt
to the earthly way of living.]

113
00:08:19,275 --> 00:08:23,239
I'm sorry, but I really can't get wet in
the rain with the way I'm dressed right now.

114
00:08:23,705 --> 00:08:25,972
My makeup is starting to smear
and wash off.

- Where? SBS?
- Hero help mission?

117
00:08:38,116 --> 00:08:41,469
[Complete the hero help mission within
time limit given at a specific location.]

118
00:08:48,186 --> 00:08:49,980
Okay, I understand.

119
00:08:49,981 --> 00:08:53,121
If I had my powers,
I could be there in less than a minute.

120
00:08:54,122 --> 00:08:57,906
[When the heroes are powerless,
they resort to taking a cab.]

121
00:08:57,907 --> 00:09:00,874
I have to take a cab?
While looking like this?

122
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:04,393
I have to take a cab looking like this?
I'm going to scare them.

123

[You're going to make the
cab drivers faint.]

124
00:09:08,654 --> 00:09:12,418
Hello, can I get in your cab?

125
00:09:13,368 --> 00:09:15,976
See?
He doesn't look happy about it.

126
00:09:15,977 --> 00:09:18,904
Is there anything I can help you with?
Would you like for me to drive?

127
00:09:18,905 --> 00:09:21,123
Should I just sit back and stay quiet?

128
00:09:22,573 --> 00:09:26,646
[Kkuk-verine must take the public bus.]

129

[The cab isn't moving very fast.]

134
00:10:02,917 --> 00:10:05,702
If it was back in the day,
I would've just flown there.

135

You dare laugh?

136
00:10:09,387 --> 00:10:12,769
You're lucky that I've lost my powers.

137
00:10:13,178 --> 00:10:17,003

be paying a dear price for that.

Where do I go now?

144

somewhere and rescue something...

[He must find someone who's in
need for some sort of help.]

This really isn't my style.

People might even mistake me
for Spiderman.

148

They're looking at me like I'm a freak!

175

They're all avoiding me.

176

They don't even think it's funny,

We have to get to the airport for
our honeymoon, and our car is stuck.

183

- Please help us get our car out.
- You want your car out?

184

- Yes, this red car.
- This one?

186

- Yes, this red car.
- You want it freed?

I'm not as strong right now because I just
woke up from a hundred year slumber.

189
00:13:35,632 --> 00:13:39,497
I wonder if pushing will help
get the car freed.

- What are we going to do?
- How did your car get stuck like this?

191
00:13:42,436 --> 00:13:46,672
- Yes, the red car.
- I don't know how it's going to work.

192
00:13:46,673 --> 00:13:51,643
Wait, how am I going to do this?
I would've just lifted it back in the day.

193
00:13:51,644 --> 00:13:58,228
I would've just lifted this out of the way
and set it down over there.

194
00:13:58,229 --> 00:14:00,880
Please help free our car.

195

- What am I going to do?

196

- Hello.
- Help.

- What am I going to do?
- What is it?

198
00:14:17,874 --> 00:14:19,627
I was just trying to get my change

199
00:14:19,627 --> 00:14:23,127
and ended up dropping the keepsake
that my son gave me.

200
00:14:23,128 --> 00:14:24,892
- You dropped your keepsake?
- Yes.

201
00:14:24,893 --> 00:14:29,190
- Where did you drop it?
- It rolled underneath the vending machine.

202
00:14:29,191 --> 00:14:32,178
Please help me find it, Avatar.

203

- What am I going to do?
- Can you hold up my umbrella for me?

204

Just put your faith in me,
and I'll get it for you.

- The vending machine...

Just a little bit more.
Come on, Avatar.

208
00:14:52,296 --> 00:14:54,462
I don't think you're going to get it.

209

- How am I going to get it?
- How will I ever get it back?

210
00:14:57,084 --> 00:15:01,081
- Are you sure that it's under here?
- Yes, I saw it roll under the machine.

211
00:15:01,082 --> 00:15:03,100
[Of all the coins under the machine,
only one of them is her keepsake coin.]

212
00:15:03,101 --> 00:15:05,547
Look, it's all smearing off.
My skin underneath is starting to show.

213
00:15:06,297 --> 00:15:08,747
If your skin starts to show,
then do you start to lose your powers?

214
00:15:08,748 --> 00:15:12,026
No, it's not like that.
It won't make me lose my powers.

215
00:15:12,757 --> 00:15:16,414
[Back to Yoo-perman in Sangahm.]

216
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:19,517
There's nothing special to being a hero.
This is the sort of things that I help with.

217

[This hero is busy massaging her neck

- Yes.

- Yes, it feels good.

Yes, it feels good, doesn't it? But I
must get back to my own work now.

223

Goodbye.

224

- What?

228

and I haven't seen her in a long time.

- You need to find your younger sister?

230
00:16:10,278 --> 00:16:13,815
- What is her name?
- Her name is, Kim Da Hae.

231

- Da Hae?
- Yes.

232
00:16:15,634 --> 00:16:17,729

- I forgot my phone at home.

234

Okay, you need help finding Da Hae?

235

- Okay, don't worry.
- She looks a lot like me.

236

- Is she your twin?
- She looks very much like me.

237
00:16:29,783 --> 00:16:34,156
Really? Okay, I got it.
Is she wearing pants or a skirt?

238
00:16:34,157 --> 00:16:37,342
- I have no idea what she may be wearing.
- Okay, I understand.

239
00:16:37,343 --> 00:16:41,801
- How long is her hair?
- It's been a while since I've seen her...

240
00:16:42,438 --> 00:16:46,264
Does she like to go heavy
with her makeup or no?

241
00:16:46,265 --> 00:16:49,167
- Is she wearing a shoulder bag?
- I have no idea.

Just go and find her.

Wow, you must be rich.

- Nice and clean!

300
00:20:44,813 --> 00:20:47,266
You have to remember to shower before
entering the pool because

you don't want to shock the heart with
the sudden coldness of the water, okay?

328
00:22:28,873 --> 00:22:32,055
Come on, cheer me on.
Cheer on my name.

329
00:22:32,056 --> 00:22:34,676
- Hong Gil Dong!
- It's Ha Gil Dong.

330
00:22:34,677 --> 00:22:37,174
- Han Gil Dong!
- It's Ha Gil Dong.

331
00:22:37,175 --> 00:22:39,818
Ha Gil Dong!

332
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:45,084
[Only one of these books is the correct one.]

333
00:22:46,866 --> 00:22:49,211
I see something!

334
00:22:49,212 --> 00:22:51,095
[Did he already discover something?]

335
00:22:53,002 --> 00:22:54,685
What's this?

336
00:22:54,686 --> 00:22:57,267
This is a chain letter
that started in England

337
00:22:57,268 --> 00:23:00,887
and it must be passed onto the next...
Are you kidding me?

338
00:23:01,461 --> 00:23:04,173
Who are you?
Tell me who you are.

339
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:08,053
- All I did was hide my money.
- Now I have to write a chain letter.

340
00:23:12,954 --> 00:23:17,384
[Must make a fresh cream cake in lieu
of the pastry chef who hurt her arm.]

341
00:23:17,385 --> 00:23:19,809
This is going to turn into cream?

342
00:23:19,810 --> 00:23:22,046
[Must make the fresh
whipped cream with the milk.]

343
00:23:22,047 --> 00:23:24,006
I look really ugly, don't I?

344
00:23:25,933 --> 00:23:28,883
Wow, it's stuck in there.

345
00:23:28,884 --> 00:23:30,934
[Putting the cream frosting onto the cake.]

346
00:23:30,935 --> 00:23:33,208
[Gae Oh Gong's delicious looking cake.]

347
00:23:33,209 --> 00:23:37,455
[Yoo-perman's mission-
Find the younger sibling, Da Hae.]

348
00:23:37,992 --> 00:23:40,782
Wait... is that her?

349
00:23:40,783 --> 00:23:42,576
Wait.

350
00:23:42,577 --> 00:23:44,842
[Yoo-perman spots someone
and runs towards her.]

351
00:23:45,297 --> 00:23:49,428
- By any chance, is your name 'Da Hae'?
- No, it's not.

352
00:23:49,429 --> 00:23:51,574
It's not?
Okay, I got it.

353
00:23:51,575 --> 00:23:53,420
Have a great day.

354
00:23:53,421 --> 00:24:00,268
[Da Hae... just where in the
world are you?]

355
00:24:00,269 --> 00:24:01,770
[Must find the woman who looks like
the woman seeking her sister.]

356
00:24:01,771 --> 00:24:03,911
Okay, I must move faster.

357
00:24:05,728 --> 00:24:08,732
[The same sound repeatedly
coming out of his mouth...]

358
00:24:11,888 --> 00:24:14,683
You're not going to be able to
keep up with me at that rate.

359
00:24:16,757 --> 00:24:19,035
Did you see that?

360
00:24:19,036 --> 00:24:21,933
You won't be able to capture me on film
if you don't pick up the pace.

361
00:24:21,934 --> 00:24:24,226
You're running way too fast.

362
00:24:24,227 --> 00:24:29,370
Even though I may have lost my powers,
I'm still a superhero.

363
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:32,906
A normal human being like yourself
can never keep up with me.

364
00:24:32,907 --> 00:24:34,564
Is that understood?

365
00:24:34,565 --> 00:24:40,634
I'm going to get back to my searching,
so try to keep up with me.

366
00:24:40,635 --> 00:24:43,369
I'll disappear from the camera
in the blink of an eye.

367
00:24:45,249 --> 00:24:47,949
[He's something else...]

368
00:24:51,287 --> 00:24:56,283
[Looks just like her!]

369
00:24:56,284 --> 00:24:59,083
By any chance, are you Da Hae?

370
00:24:59,084 --> 00:25:03,818
[Could this be her?]

371
00:25:03,819 --> 00:25:05,673
Yes, I am.

372
00:25:05,674 --> 00:25:08,983
[She's found!]

373
00:25:09,303 --> 00:25:12,651
Wait, I've found you.
I've finally found Da Hae.

374
00:25:13,871 --> 00:25:17,011
[A round and round ceremony.]

375
00:25:17,834 --> 00:25:21,815
Okay, shall we go?
You're on your way to meet your sister?

376
00:25:21,816 --> 00:25:24,333
- Yes, I am.
- Are you twins?

377
00:25:24,334 --> 00:25:26,659
[Twin sisters!]

378
00:25:30,145 --> 00:25:32,167
[Successfully reunites the twin sisters!]

379
00:25:32,168 --> 00:25:36,506
Isn't that too weak of a greeting when
you haven't seen each other in five years?

380
00:25:37,698 --> 00:25:39,810
- Thank you.
- This is your sister, correct?

381
00:25:39,811 --> 00:25:45,568
- Yes, it is.
- I must go and help some more people.

382
00:25:49,483 --> 00:25:53,015
[Gives him a sticker as a sign
of her appreciation.]

383
00:25:53,437 --> 00:25:55,807
Thank you, hero!

384
00:26:02,647 --> 00:26:06,762
I haven't given anyone a thumb kiss
to the forehead in quite some time.

385
00:26:06,763 --> 00:26:12,381
I hope that you two will stay together now,
and call out for help whenever you need it.

386
00:26:12,382 --> 00:26:14,100
Goodbye!

387
00:26:14,101 --> 00:26:16,409
Then I'll just be going now.

388
00:26:17,651 --> 00:26:19,601
[A dramatic exit every time.]

389
00:26:19,602 --> 00:26:23,349
[Ask for Yoo-perman whenever
you're in need of any help.]

390
00:26:24,675 --> 00:26:27,920
There aren't that many people
around because it's Monday.

391
00:26:29,042 --> 00:26:32,214
[Kwang-vatar is searching for anyone
whom he could be of help to.]

392
00:26:32,215 --> 00:26:34,950
I'm sorry.

393
00:26:44,582 --> 00:26:46,902
[These ladies are still unaware of
the new person joining them.]

394
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:53,302
Are you busy right now?

395
00:26:53,303 --> 00:26:56,581
[Attempting to start a conversation
with the lady waiting for her bus.]

396
00:27:01,034 --> 00:27:05,342
[Collapses onto the bench from
the shock and fright of seeing him.]

397
00:27:05,343 --> 00:27:07,738
I'm so sorry.

398
00:27:08,978 --> 00:27:11,950
- Are you going somewhere?
- I'm going to school.

399
00:27:11,951 --> 00:27:18,111
You don't have much time, do you?
I have to find a keepsake coin right now.

400
00:27:19,462 --> 00:27:23,206
But I just don't think I can do it on my own.
Can you help me for five minutes?

401
00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:26,149
[Backs away...]

402
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:30,415
- Can you help me for five minutes?
- What are you trying to do?

403
00:27:30,416 --> 00:27:33,208
Can you help me for five minutes?
I need to find a coin.

404
00:27:33,802 --> 00:27:36,501
But I just can't get it on my own.

405
00:27:36,502 --> 00:27:38,994
[The kind students agree to help him.]

406
00:27:39,382 --> 00:27:42,185
The fate of this planet depends on it!

407
00:27:42,186 --> 00:27:47,416
You have to put your life on the line...
and help me find this coin.

408
00:27:48,133 --> 00:27:50,531
But I have no idea where it is.

409
00:27:50,532 --> 00:27:51,850
[The nuisance of a hero
relies on these ladies' help.]

410
00:27:53,106 --> 00:27:57,073
[The smart student pulls out her phone
to utilize the flash for better viewing.]

411
00:27:57,074 --> 00:28:00,835
If you'll flash the light under it,
then I'll see if I can find it.

412
00:28:01,457 --> 00:28:04,886
- Do you see it?
- Why is this so difficult?

413
00:28:05,668 --> 00:28:08,664
I've already been here for the last hour.

414
00:28:09,475 --> 00:28:13,320
Everyone, I need your help.
We have to work together.

415
00:28:13,321 --> 00:28:16,184
When I say 'earth', you say, 'ours!'

416
00:28:16,185 --> 00:28:19,200
Earth is... ours!

417
00:28:19,201 --> 00:28:23,145
Louder!
The earth is ours!

418
00:28:24,755 --> 00:28:26,934
Is it in the middle?

419
00:28:26,935 --> 00:28:28,486
Is that it?

420
00:28:28,487 --> 00:28:31,875
[The kind students are helping him find
the coin as if it's their own job.]

421
00:28:32,648 --> 00:28:35,757
- Do you see anything?
- Ma'am.

422
00:28:35,758 --> 00:28:38,713
Why don't you go get yourself
a cup of coffee and come back later?

423
00:28:38,714 --> 00:28:42,631
No, I have to find my coin.
There's no time to get any coffee.

424
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:47,553
Here it is!
I found it!

425
00:28:48,341 --> 00:28:50,965
Here it  is!
I found it!

426
00:28:50,966 --> 00:28:53,828
[Could it be the real
keepsake coin this time?]

427
00:28:54,194 --> 00:28:58,317
I found it!
I finally found it!

428
00:28:58,318 --> 00:29:01,552
Thank you everyone!

429
00:29:01,553 --> 00:29:04,563
- What's your name?
- It's Yoo Joo Yeon.

430
00:29:04,564 --> 00:29:07,805
Ji Yeon and Hyun Jung...

431
00:29:07,806 --> 00:29:10,231
They helped save the earth!

432
00:29:10,232 --> 00:29:12,983
[Why does he keep talking
about the earth?]

433
00:29:14,271 --> 00:29:17,171
The earth is a very beautiful place!

434
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:20,248
Goodbye!
Thanks again!

435
00:29:20,249 --> 00:29:23,317
- Thank you so much, my hero.
- No, not at all.

436
00:29:23,318 --> 00:29:25,942
- Thank you so much.
- It was my pleasure.

437
00:29:25,943 --> 00:29:28,803
[Thank you, Kwang-vatar.
A sticker for your troubles.]

438
00:29:28,804 --> 00:29:32,529
Goodbye, Ma'am!
Promise me you'll never lose it again!

439
00:29:32,530 --> 00:29:36,124
[Kwang-vatar also successfully
completes his hero mission.]

440
00:29:36,957 --> 00:29:40,619
[Meanwhile, Wonder Blank is still busy
digging in the dirt...]

441
00:29:43,205 --> 00:29:47,057
I used to be pretty successful,
but I don't know what happened.

442
00:29:47,058 --> 00:29:49,828
[Desperately wishing for her powers.]

443
00:29:55,138 --> 00:30:01,333
I'm going to give you a command.
Tell me where the deed to the land is

444
00:30:01,334 --> 00:30:04,639
and I'll forgive you
for all your incessant barking.

445
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:07,815
What did you say?

446
00:30:07,816 --> 00:30:13,470
Walk 20 paces to my right,
and try digging in that area?

447
00:30:14,343 --> 00:30:17,925
I'm going to remember that
bark of yours.

448
00:30:17,926 --> 00:30:20,881
To the right.
One, two, three, four...

449
00:30:20,882 --> 00:30:24,101
[The dogs are guiding Wonder Blank
to where the deed is buried?]

450
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,635
The other direction?

451
00:30:28,406 --> 00:30:31,264
[Wonder Blank is starting to lose it.]

452
00:30:31,265 --> 00:30:34,562
[Gained the ability to communicate with
dogs in place of her superpowers?]

453
00:30:34,563 --> 00:30:36,286
Here?

454
00:30:37,058 --> 00:30:38,702
Okay.

455
00:30:40,794 --> 00:30:44,258
[Starts digging in the spot
where the dogs led her to...]

456
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:46,404
This is the place, you say?

457
00:30:46,405 --> 00:30:50,742
If I end up finding the deed buried here

458
00:30:50,743 --> 00:30:55,116
then I will hire all of you as guard dogs
in the 60 story hotel building!

459
00:30:57,730 --> 00:31:01,085
[Did they lead her to the right place?]

460
00:31:02,508 --> 00:31:06,266
[Can't be...]

461
00:31:06,267 --> 00:31:08,938
Awesome.
Hey, I really found it!

462
00:31:08,939 --> 00:31:12,492
Hey, I really found it!
Guys, I actually found it!

463
00:31:12,493 --> 00:31:14,984
[Did she really find the deed to the land?]

464
00:31:14,985 --> 00:31:17,034
[Wonder Blank seems to have
gotten it right.]

465
00:31:17,035 --> 00:31:19,780
Guys, I really did find it!

466
00:31:21,365 --> 00:31:24,169
[Wow, how unbelievable!]

467
00:31:24,170 --> 00:31:28,184
I can't believe that actually worked,
and that I was able to find this!

468
00:31:30,925 --> 00:31:32,585
Thanks!

469
00:31:32,586 --> 00:31:35,380
Guys, this is all thanks to you!

470
00:31:39,867 --> 00:31:41,784
Oh, it's upside down.

471
00:31:42,529 --> 00:31:51,051
Guys, I'll talk to the President and I'll get
all of you hired on as security dogs!

472
00:31:51,052 --> 00:31:52,789
You just wait!

473
00:31:52,790 --> 00:31:55,983
[With the help of the dogs,
Wonder Blank also clears her mission.]

474
00:31:57,265 --> 00:32:01,419
[But this hero still hasn't been
able to clear his mission.]

475
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:03,338
Wait, let me think.

476
00:32:05,789 --> 00:32:08,449
Are you just going to keep thinking
and do nothing about this?

477
00:32:08,450 --> 00:32:12,625
- We're going to miss our flight.
- Can you just take the bus there?

478
00:32:12,626 --> 00:32:15,315
- But we didn't bring our bus pass.
- Seriously?

479
00:32:15,316 --> 00:32:18,749
That's no good. I just woke up from sleep,
so I don't have any money either.

480
00:32:19,550 --> 00:32:21,912
Okay, I think I got it.

481
00:32:21,913 --> 00:32:24,821
- Okay, I got it now.
- Are you doing to do something now?

482
00:32:24,822 --> 00:32:27,599
Okay, I'm going to move this
out of the way.

483
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:32,655
Get the luggage, Yoo Jin.

484
00:32:32,656 --> 00:32:36,031
- Make sure the path is clear.
- Let me help you out.

485
00:32:37,954 --> 00:32:40,746
You're doing great, just a bit further.

486
00:32:40,747 --> 00:32:43,972
- Okay, is this good?
- Just a bit more.

487
00:32:43,973 --> 00:32:46,208
Okay, I'll get the next one.

488
00:32:48,574 --> 00:32:54,048
Kkuk-verine!

489
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:58,333
You're going to make it to
your honeymoon!

490
00:32:58,334 --> 00:33:01,816
- Kkuk-verine!
- Okay!

491
00:33:01,817 --> 00:33:06,275
[The exit is now open!]

492
00:33:06,276 --> 00:33:08,582
Okay, let's push this one out.

493
00:33:08,583 --> 00:33:13,133
[I will make sure that you make it
to your honeymoon!]

494
00:33:14,896 --> 00:33:17,008
Thank you.

495
00:33:17,009 --> 00:33:18,819
[The wedding car successfully
makes it out of the lot!]

496
00:33:19,837 --> 00:33:21,653
Thank you so much!

497
00:33:21,654 --> 00:33:24,346
[I'm Kkuk-verine!]

498
00:33:25,882 --> 00:33:29,022
- You really are a true superhero.
- It was my pleasure.

499
00:33:29,023 --> 00:33:31,327
- This is for you.
- Thank you.

500
00:33:31,328 --> 00:33:35,418
[Kkuk-verine also clears his mission.]

501
00:33:35,419 --> 00:33:37,332
- Enjoy your honeymoon.
- Thank you.

502
00:33:37,333 --> 00:33:39,536
- Fighting!
- Thanks again!

503
00:33:39,537 --> 00:33:41,966
This is the joy of being a hero.

504
00:33:43,995 --> 00:33:48,844
[Everyone heads off to their next location!]

505
00:33:50,486 --> 00:33:55,252
[Anti-hero will get in their way again if
everyone doesn't make it back on time...]

506
00:33:55,253 --> 00:33:59,975
- I used to be able to fly.
- My joints are rusty from all the sleep.

507
00:33:59,976 --> 00:34:04,354
- Yes, mine too.
- Time to rejoin the rest of the heroes!

508
00:34:06,017 --> 00:34:10,264
[Will all the heroes be able to
make it back in time?]

509
00:34:11,897 --> 00:34:16,840
[First hero to arrive- Yoo-perman.]

510
00:34:18,476 --> 00:34:20,638
[Second hero- Wonder Blank.]

511
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:22,486
<i>That's my theme song, Ji Hyo.</i>

512
00:34:22,487 --> 00:34:24,839
[Gae Oh Gong also makes it back in time.]

513
00:34:25,354 --> 00:34:28,158
I think I understand why most
heroes suffer from depression.

514
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:31,402
Most heroes suffer from
loneliness and depression.

515
00:34:31,403 --> 00:34:33,169
[The lonely lives of these heroes...]

516
00:34:33,170 --> 00:34:36,374
We should form a union or something.

517
00:34:36,375 --> 00:34:40,849
- No one even acknowledges us.
- I took this off, but put it back on.

518
00:34:40,884 --> 00:34:44,150
- Why?
- Everyone thinks I'm Elvis Presley.

519
00:34:45,228 --> 00:34:47,370
So I put this back on
even though it's uncomfortable.

520
00:34:47,371 --> 00:34:51,010
Because everyone thinks that I'm
Elvis Presley when I don't wear it.

521
00:34:51,011 --> 00:34:55,478
- I see what you mean. You should keep it on.
- Why does Superman look like such a brat?

522
00:34:58,506 --> 00:35:00,792
And you're supposed to take your glasses
off when you transform into Superman.

523
00:35:00,793 --> 00:35:04,567
My vision's just gotten bad because
I've lost all my superpowers!

524
00:35:04,568 --> 00:35:07,658
And I've never seen such an ugly
looking Batman before in my life.

525
00:35:07,659 --> 00:35:11,350
You have no room to talk. You're
the ugliest Superman I've ever seen.

526
00:35:11,951 --> 00:35:15,316
[Just then, the biggest shocker of the day,
Kwang-vatar shows up on scene.]

527
00:35:15,317 --> 00:35:17,718
I'm really curious to know how
people have been reacting to you.

528
00:35:17,719 --> 00:35:20,158
They treat me like I'm a freak.

529
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:22,855
I don't think they realize
that I'm filming a show.

530
00:35:22,856 --> 00:35:25,644
They pretend that they didn't even see
me even after our eyes have met.

531
00:35:26,101 --> 00:35:29,208
- I think I'd react the same way.
- Have you tried going to the bathroom yet?

532
00:35:29,209 --> 00:35:31,585
- Yes.
- I have to take everything off.

533
00:35:32,646 --> 00:35:36,660
I had to ask someone to help me
get my zipper down earlier.

534
00:35:36,661 --> 00:35:40,528
- What's going on in here?
- Ha Gil Dong!

535
00:35:40,529 --> 00:35:43,849
[Just then, Ha Gil Dong arrives
past the time limit.]

536
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:47,793
- What took you so long to get here?
- He looks like a pottery seller in Damdaemun.

537
00:35:47,794 --> 00:35:51,259
You look like the guy from
that show on TV.

538
00:35:52,339 --> 00:35:57,901
Even though you've all cleared your missions,
you failed to show up here on time.

539
00:35:57,902 --> 00:35:59,088
Why did you have to be late?

540
00:35:59,089 --> 00:36:05,744
Therefore, I can only give the final
location hint to only six of you.

541
00:36:05,745 --> 00:36:07,176
[One of the heroes can't be given
the hint to the final location.]

542
00:36:07,177 --> 00:36:12,572
Discuss amongst yourselves and
decide which six will receive the hint.

543
00:36:12,573 --> 00:36:14,928
- What's there to even decide?
- He was late, so he doesn't get it.

544
00:36:14,929 --> 00:36:18,640
- What's there to even discuss?
- I really did try my best.

545
00:36:18,641 --> 00:36:21,516
- All of us here did our best!
- I'm being serious right now.

546
00:36:21,517 --> 00:36:25,744
- But we were still able to get here on time.
- Let's just vote on it.

547
00:36:25,745 --> 00:36:29,332
- You never know what may happen.
- Tell me what you think.

548
00:36:29,333 --> 00:36:31,527
Just say the name of the person
you want to eliminate.

549
00:36:31,528 --> 00:36:33,824
[Relays their vote to Yoo-perman.]

550
00:36:35,998 --> 00:36:37,706
Hong Gil Dong.

551
00:36:38,163 --> 00:36:39,880
Okay, your vote?

552
00:36:40,736 --> 00:36:43,452
Okay, two votes for Hong Gil Dong,
and one vote for Wolverine.

553
00:36:49,070 --> 00:36:52,774
[Unable to maintain a straight face.]

554
00:36:53,390 --> 00:36:56,305
- It wasn't me.
- What are you talking about?

555
00:36:57,123 --> 00:36:59,368
Okay, Wolverine's vote.

556
00:36:59,369 --> 00:37:02,610
- Batman.
- Okay, Batman.

557
00:37:02,611 --> 00:37:05,380
Okay, then it's two against one against one.

558
00:37:07,007 --> 00:37:10,276
- Please don't get too close.
- I have to whisper it to you.

559
00:37:12,434 --> 00:37:14,429
Wolverine...

560
00:37:14,996 --> 00:37:18,364
It's two against two. Two for
Hong Gil Dong and two for Wolverine.

561
00:37:21,685 --> 00:37:24,099
Three votes for Wolverine.

562
00:37:25,482 --> 00:37:28,677
Traitors Cross!

563
00:37:28,678 --> 00:37:31,102
In that case...

564
00:37:32,883 --> 00:37:35,313
- It's all up to Jae Suk now.
- I think this is going to be trouble.

565
00:37:35,314 --> 00:37:37,932
I'm not sure now.
I vote for Batman.

566
00:37:39,126 --> 00:37:43,507
[Ha Gil Dong- 2;
Wolverine- 3; Jitman- 2.]

567
00:37:43,508 --> 00:37:47,130
[Wolverine is chosen
not to receive the hint.]

568
00:37:47,131 --> 00:37:49,927
[I will make you regret this.]

569
00:37:50,504 --> 00:37:52,757
[Everyone except for Kkuk-verine
receives their hint.]

570
00:37:56,227 --> 00:38:04,068
[Place where the light gathers
on Han river.]

571
00:38:04,069 --> 00:38:06,937
We will now move on to our
next location.

572
00:38:09,445 --> 00:38:11,850
[Kwang-vatar's uncomfortable
expression on his face.]

573
00:38:14,267 --> 00:38:18,120
[The information which only he received
at the opening of the show...]

574
00:38:20,144 --> 00:38:22,614
[Is that information linked to
the hint that he just received?]

575
00:38:22,615 --> 00:38:25,160
You can ride with someone else
if you don't want to be here.

576
00:38:31,157 --> 00:38:33,071
[A quiet neighborhood in Seoul.]

577
00:38:33,072 --> 00:38:35,358
I'm serious!

578
00:38:36,927 --> 00:38:38,647
Just me?

579
00:38:38,648 --> 00:38:44,208
Can't you be more secretive about it and
ask me quietly without others knowing?

580
00:38:45,102 --> 00:38:47,436
They're all very suspicious
of me right now.

581
00:38:52,375 --> 00:38:55,398
[Kwang-vatar still sticks out visually
even from a faraway distance.]

582
00:38:55,399 --> 00:38:57,518
Why am I the only one being
called out?

583
00:38:57,519 --> 00:38:59,908
[What's the mission that
awaits him here?]

584
00:39:01,649 --> 00:39:05,991
What's that?

585
00:39:11,497 --> 00:39:13,047
What is that?

586
00:39:13,048 --> 00:39:15,803
[What in the world is that?]

587
00:39:15,804 --> 00:39:18,867
For our next mission, we will
test our hero's level of courage.

588
00:39:18,868 --> 00:39:22,113
[Test of courage?]

589
00:39:24,511 --> 00:39:26,331
You're not...

590
00:39:31,822 --> 00:39:34,779
[The wooden plank connecting
the two buildings together...]

591
00:39:35,642 --> 00:39:38,890
[And double layers of safety net and mat...]

592
00:39:39,690 --> 00:39:42,336
You expect me to cross to
the other side?

593
00:39:42,337 --> 00:39:45,015
You expect me to cross to the other side?

594
00:39:45,016 --> 00:39:48,663
This is a mission for Batman or Superman.
Avatar doesn't do things like that.

595
00:39:48,664 --> 00:39:51,788
An Avatar doesn't have any special powers.
An Avatar is just really tall.

596
00:39:51,789 --> 00:39:54,106
I'm just a tall, blue man.

597
00:39:55,992 --> 00:39:59,242
[That's just absurd...]

598
00:39:59,243 --> 00:40:02,338
Please get up on the roof
of the building on the right.

599
00:40:02,339 --> 00:40:04,004
By myself?

600
00:40:08,184 --> 00:40:13,858
[The terror that's headed their way...
Will our heroes be able to overcome it?]

601
00:40:15,151 --> 00:40:17,804
How many floors are there?
This is ludicrous.

602
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:24,010
[An uneasy feeling that creeps in
while making his way up the stairs.]

603
00:40:24,011 --> 00:40:27,714
An Avatar doesn't...
Wait, be careful of my ears.

604
00:40:27,715 --> 00:40:30,090
My ears!

605
00:40:32,294 --> 00:40:35,658
[They're blindfolding him!]

606
00:40:37,538 --> 00:40:41,546
- Climb the rest with his help.
- Wait, my foot...

607
00:40:41,547 --> 00:40:45,123
[He's being led away somewhere
while completely blindfolded.]

608
00:40:46,103 --> 00:40:48,203
Can I give up on the mission?

609
00:40:48,204 --> 00:40:50,527
No?
I have no choice but to do it?

610
00:40:50,528 --> 00:40:53,645
[He will not be given any additional hints
if he gives up on the mission.]

611
00:40:55,170 --> 00:40:57,599
Wow, this is too much.

612
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:00,446
Turn a little to the left.

613
00:41:01,845 --> 00:41:05,736
- Where?
- One more step in front of you.

614
00:41:07,914 --> 00:41:11,030
- There's a slight step down.
- A step down?

615
00:41:13,002 --> 00:41:15,930
[Kwang-vatar arrives at the rooftop.]

616
00:41:20,204 --> 00:41:22,345
We must be outside
because I can feel the rain.

617
00:41:22,346 --> 00:41:24,728
I can't get rained on because
it'll make my makeup smear off.

618
00:41:24,729 --> 00:41:27,759
- Where am I going? Where?
- Almost there.

619
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:30,875
- There's a slight step up.
- Another step up?

620
00:41:30,876 --> 00:41:33,147
These steps are a bit tall.

621
00:41:33,148 --> 00:41:36,743
What is this?
Is this for real?

622
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:41,721
Put your hand out to the left and
grab onto the rope beneath your hand.

623
00:41:41,722 --> 00:41:44,418
- Wait, this is for real?
- There's one more step in front of you.

624
00:41:44,419 --> 00:41:47,259
- You guys must be out of your minds!
- Take one more step up.

625
00:41:48,333 --> 00:41:50,505
You have heard me tell you
that this is to test your courage.

626
00:41:50,506 --> 00:41:54,927
If you cross the plank to the other side,
you will be given your next hint.

627
00:41:54,928 --> 00:41:57,025
[Cross to the other side to win
the hint to the final location.]

628
00:42:02,721 --> 00:42:06,184
[A single wooden plank connecting the two
five story buildings together.]

629
00:42:06,185 --> 00:42:09,568
[Will he be able to cross it?]

630
00:42:10,082 --> 00:42:12,481
Can I crawl on my knees?

631
00:42:12,482 --> 00:42:15,313
- I can crawl across?
- That's up to you.

632
00:42:16,127 --> 00:42:18,683
- On the other side...
- This is for real!

633
00:42:18,684 --> 00:42:21,081
Why are you doing this to me?

634
00:42:21,082 --> 00:42:23,192
[Don't you think that
this is being too harsh?]

635
00:42:24,442 --> 00:42:29,253
If you follow the rope across,
there's a bell at the end of the rope.

636
00:42:29,254 --> 00:42:35,408
If you ring the bell to signify that you've
successfully cleared your mission

637
00:42:35,409 --> 00:42:38,167
that's when you can take off the blindfold.
Do not let go of the rope.

638
00:42:38,168 --> 00:42:41,009
We don't want any accidents either.

639
00:42:41,010 --> 00:42:45,041
This is really... Must you really go
this far to test our courage?

640
00:42:45,593 --> 00:42:48,257
I'm not a superhero!

641
00:42:52,903 --> 00:42:55,509
Wow, this is real.
This is for real!

642
00:42:59,049 --> 00:43:02,206
[Must cross this narrow plank
while completely blindfolded.]

643
00:43:05,781 --> 00:43:07,654
What am I going to do?

644
00:43:07,655 --> 00:43:10,208
[All the safety precautions have
been taken.]

645
00:43:11,271 --> 00:43:15,180
[Only one thin rope to help him get across.]

646
00:43:21,062 --> 00:43:25,008
You must grab onto the rope, Kwang Soo.
It's dangerous, so hold onto the rope.

647
00:43:28,954 --> 00:43:31,859
[The rope sways to and fro
from Kwang-vatar's weight.]

648
00:43:33,482 --> 00:43:37,313
[Can't hear anything else except for
his expressions of fear and terror.]

649
00:43:39,607 --> 00:43:41,257
What's this?

650
00:43:43,308 --> 00:43:46,440
[Did he already arrive on the other side?]

651
00:43:47,679 --> 00:43:49,615
Is this the end?

652
00:43:56,188 --> 00:43:58,565
You have succeeded your mission.
You may now take off your blindfold.

653
00:44:05,813 --> 00:44:09,214
[Finally takes off the blindfold...]

654
00:44:16,894 --> 00:44:22,925
[Wait, what is this?]

655
00:44:35,590 --> 00:44:38,366
[This is the terrorizing test of courage.]

656
00:44:41,585 --> 00:44:44,725
[Never any intentions of crossing this one.]

657
00:44:45,718 --> 00:44:48,877
I really wasn't all that scared.

658
00:44:52,443 --> 00:44:56,763
[Can't help but laugh out of the sheer
audacity and embarrassment of the situation.]

659
00:44:57,602 --> 00:44:59,459
Why did you...

660
00:45:01,187 --> 00:45:04,799
Wow, this really is embarrassing.
This is really embarrassing.

661
00:45:06,038 --> 00:45:09,241
Can you just edit out the scene
where I collapsed onto the ground?

662
00:45:09,810 --> 00:45:12,532
[I wish I could turn back time...]

663
00:45:12,533 --> 00:45:18,246
Please edit that out for me, and
play the theme song to Avatar over it.

664
00:45:18,247 --> 00:45:21,822
- Sure, don't worry about it.
- Lower the volume on my panicked breathing.

665
00:45:21,823 --> 00:45:23,623
Please help me out.

666
00:45:23,995 --> 00:45:25,997
[Thus a new project is born...]

667
00:45:26,558 --> 00:45:29,527
Where am I going?
How far am I going?

668
00:45:29,528 --> 00:45:33,044
What?
What is this? This is for real?

669
00:45:33,649 --> 00:45:36,855
[Crossing the wooden plank as if
he's crossing a stiff cliff.]

670
00:45:36,856 --> 00:45:40,043
[Kwang-vatar's great adventure.]

671
00:45:41,229 --> 00:45:51,975
[Sits... lays back... crawls...
Great efforts to reach and ring the bell.]

672
00:45:53,118 --> 00:45:55,709
[Our very own hero, Kwang-vatar...
Coming soon!]

673
00:45:56,659 --> 00:45:58,761
[Second hero, Yoo-perman.]

674
00:45:58,762 --> 00:46:00,500
Where do I need to go?

675
00:46:00,863 --> 00:46:02,568
Jae Suk!

676
00:46:02,569 --> 00:46:04,520
What is that?

677
00:46:04,521 --> 00:46:06,265
[Putting his acting skills to work.]

678
00:46:06,266 --> 00:46:08,387
What is this thing?

679
00:46:10,026 --> 00:46:12,240
You can't be serious!

680
00:46:14,287 --> 00:46:17,276
What are you guys trying to do!

681
00:46:27,232 --> 00:46:30,140
How am I going to cross that
with my eyes blindfolded?

682
00:46:30,624 --> 00:46:34,581
[Kwang-vatar's acting chops to
pull one over Yoo-perman.]

683
00:46:34,582 --> 00:46:36,593
Jae Suk, this is for real.

684
00:46:37,407 --> 00:46:39,023
Jae Suk.

685
00:46:39,426 --> 00:46:41,464
I'm seriously going to lose it.

686
00:46:41,465 --> 00:46:43,978
[How is this even possible?]

687
00:46:43,979 --> 00:46:47,475
[Yes, it makes perfect sense.]

688
00:46:48,683 --> 00:46:51,420
[Yoo-perman enters the building.]

689
00:46:56,191 --> 00:46:59,168
You will need to wear a blindfold
the remainder of the way.

690
00:47:03,365 --> 00:47:05,728
I'm in big trouble.

691
00:47:05,729 --> 00:47:09,958
[Yoo-perman also gets
the blindfold treatment.]

692
00:47:12,523 --> 00:47:14,715
- Watch your steps.
- Seriously.

693
00:47:16,457 --> 00:47:20,779
Yes, this might actually be better
than being able to see below.

694
00:47:21,578 --> 00:47:23,586
I'm going to lose my mind.

695
00:47:24,508 --> 00:47:27,910
[Arrives at the rooftop of the building.]

696
00:47:27,911 --> 00:47:30,945
- Be careful, there's a small step down.
- Okay.

697
00:47:36,119 --> 00:47:38,142
What is this?

698
00:47:38,143 --> 00:47:39,866
We're outside?

699
00:47:40,535 --> 00:47:43,431
- Kwang Soo!
- Jae Suk, just give up.

700
00:47:43,432 --> 00:47:46,007
- What?
- This is really way too much.

701
00:47:46,008 --> 00:47:50,217
- Okay, I got it!
- Jae Suk, it's right in front of you.

702
00:47:50,218 --> 00:47:51,897
- Where is it?
- Step up.

703
00:47:51,898 --> 00:47:55,050
Jae Suk, you really need to
be careful.

704
00:47:55,721 --> 00:48:01,346
Yoo Jae Suk, reach out with
your hand and find the rope.

705
00:48:01,347 --> 00:48:03,633
Make sure you don't let go
of that rope.

706
00:48:03,634 --> 00:48:07,153
- It's very dangerous if you do.
- How do you expect me to do this?

707
00:48:07,154 --> 00:48:10,473
Don't let go of that rope, and Kwang Soo
is waiting for you on the other side.

708
00:48:10,474 --> 00:48:13,115
Jae Suk, I think I heard the plank
crack as I was crossing it.

709
00:48:13,116 --> 00:48:17,677
- Ugh, this is driving me crazy.
- Jae Suk, you should just give up.

710
00:48:18,141 --> 00:48:21,153
I seriously think that I heard
the wood cracking.

711
00:48:21,154 --> 00:48:23,363
Jae Suk.

712
00:48:26,954 --> 00:48:29,323
This is seriously dangerous.

713
00:48:29,324 --> 00:48:32,679
- Tell me where to set my foot.
- Right where you have it.

714
00:48:33,805 --> 00:48:36,572
- But the net underneath...
- This is...

715
00:48:36,573 --> 00:48:39,011
This is seriously dangerous.

716
00:48:39,446 --> 00:48:41,797
How am I going to do this?

717
00:48:41,798 --> 00:48:44,399
This is really dangerous.
It's too dangerous, Jae Suk.

718
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:47,080
Jae Suk, you really should just give up.

719
00:48:47,081 --> 00:48:48,806
Jae Suk.

720
00:48:51,453 --> 00:48:54,700
Jae Suk, I'm serious.
You have to be really careful.

721
00:48:54,701 --> 00:48:57,017
[Whew... what do I do?]

722
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:03,297
[Your screen has not frozen over.]

723
00:49:04,341 --> 00:49:10,218
- Hey, not being able to see might be better.
- No, don't go that way!

724
00:49:10,697 --> 00:49:13,481
- Is this the right spot?
- It is, but don't go to the left.

725
00:49:14,003 --> 00:49:16,547
[Unable to take the first step.]

726
00:49:18,981 --> 00:49:20,804
Seriously... be careful!

727
00:49:20,805 --> 00:49:22,250
[Putting all his focus into
every single step he takes.]

728
00:49:29,020 --> 00:49:31,183
- Wow, this is insane.
- Jae Suk.

729
00:49:31,733 --> 00:49:35,779
[I can do this...]

730
00:49:36,359 --> 00:49:39,587
[Yoo-perman, the biggest coward,
takes the first step forward?]

731
00:49:40,424 --> 00:49:45,141
No, Jae Suk!
Go back! Step back!

732
00:49:47,582 --> 00:49:50,048
I'm so scared.
Just keep it down!

733
00:49:50,049 --> 00:49:52,432
Just keep it down over there!

734
00:49:56,493 --> 00:50:00,014
- Jae Suk!
- I'm seriously going to fall off.

735
00:50:00,015 --> 00:50:02,250
It's very dangerous!
Just go back!

736
00:50:04,797 --> 00:50:06,681
No, not that way!

737
00:50:06,682 --> 00:50:08,472
[Breathing in shallow pants out of
terrorizing fear.]

738
00:50:08,473 --> 00:50:11,462
Let me know when I've
reached the end.

739
00:50:13,577 --> 00:50:17,012
I can't stop.
Come on, please...

740
00:50:17,013 --> 00:50:19,855
[Can't stop...]

741
00:50:20,696 --> 00:50:22,342
Jae Suk!

742
00:50:28,122 --> 00:50:30,472
[In the midst of his terror, Kwang-vatar
throws an empty water bottle.]

743
00:50:31,994 --> 00:50:34,310
[Look at this guy?]

744
00:50:34,963 --> 00:50:37,328
Is it still far off?
Tell me when I'm at the end.

745
00:50:38,032 --> 00:50:40,612
[But he beats down his own fears
and still manages to forge ahead.]

746
00:50:40,613 --> 00:50:42,644
[There's the bell!]

747
00:50:42,645 --> 00:50:45,922
[Yoo-perman passes the courage test.]

748
00:50:45,923 --> 00:50:48,730
You have successfully passed.
You may now take off your blindfold.

749
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:52,123
No, don't move and
just take off your blindfold.

750
00:50:52,124 --> 00:50:55,252
[Time to take off the blindfold.]

751
00:50:55,253 --> 00:50:58,540
- I don't know if I can see.
- It's okay, take off the blindfold.

752
00:51:06,564 --> 00:51:08,924
What are you guys doing?

753
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:16,934
Come here.

754
00:51:16,935 --> 00:51:21,884
- I'm utterly speechless.
- This is Superman's true self.

755
00:51:22,905 --> 00:51:26,427
- This is the true side of Superman.
- What are you guys doing?

756
00:51:26,859 --> 00:51:29,748
Where did he go?
Gwon Yeol!

757
00:51:29,749 --> 00:51:31,882
Give me back my glasses.

758
00:51:31,883 --> 00:51:34,663
How can we entrust the fate of
this planet to someone like him?

759
00:51:34,664 --> 00:51:37,496
You looked like a baby
just learning how to walk.

760
00:51:38,047 --> 00:51:41,027
- What did you say?
- I thought you were learning to walk.

761
00:51:41,028 --> 00:51:45,825
Do you want to get beat?
Wow, this is crazy!

762
00:51:46,310 --> 00:51:49,409
What is all this?

763
00:51:49,410 --> 00:51:51,291
Wow, seriously.

764
00:51:51,292 --> 00:51:54,136
[Yoo-perman crosses over to
the other building after succeeding.]

765
00:51:54,137 --> 00:51:56,537
- You were that afraid?
- You didn't react like that?

766
00:51:56,538 --> 00:51:59,782
- You didn't react like that?
- You looked like you were crying.

767
00:52:01,117 --> 00:52:03,512
[Even through their fear, Kwang-vatar
and Yoo-perman still succeed.]

768
00:52:04,802 --> 00:52:07,542
[It's now Ha Gil Dong's turn.]

769
00:52:07,543 --> 00:52:09,193
Let's see what this is about.

770
00:52:10,362 --> 00:52:13,123
- Ha Ha gets scared real easily.
- Dong Hoon!

771
00:52:13,571 --> 00:52:15,663
What is this!

772
00:52:16,175 --> 00:52:21,535
- Dong Hoon, just give up.
- They expect me to... this is absurd!

773
00:52:21,536 --> 00:52:25,409
- No, this is just absurd!
- Dong Hoon, we both failed the mission.

774
00:52:25,410 --> 00:52:27,411
[This duo is having a blast
teasing this fearful kiddo.]

775
00:52:27,412 --> 00:52:31,364
- Ugh, this is just ridiculous.
- Just don't even bother doing it.

776
00:52:31,365 --> 00:52:34,760
I don't think I was even able
to take two steps across it.

777
00:52:34,761 --> 00:52:37,264
This is just absurd.
It's way too dangerous.

778
00:52:37,265 --> 00:52:42,076
We can't overdo it too much right now.
Let's lay off a little, okay?

779
00:52:44,441 --> 00:52:48,091
You will have to wear a blindfold
the remainder of the way.

780
00:52:48,092 --> 00:52:50,624
This isn't even right.

781
00:52:50,625 --> 00:52:52,687
Why are you doing this to me?

782
00:52:52,688 --> 00:52:55,772
Why do you like to torment us so much?

783
00:52:57,175 --> 00:52:59,825
Ugh, this is so scary.
This is even scarier.

784
00:52:59,826 --> 00:53:01,316
[Ha Gil Dong- The resident coward of
all variety programs in the nation.]

785
00:53:02,398 --> 00:53:05,098
[In an extreme state of
nervousness already.]

786
00:53:05,099 --> 00:53:07,864
- Where? I can't see anything.
- Just go straight.

787
00:53:07,865 --> 00:53:13,391
- Ha Ha, it's okay to just give up.
- Did they blindfold you too?

788
00:53:13,392 --> 00:53:16,927
I took about two steps forward,
and I just couldn't go any further.

789
00:53:16,928 --> 00:53:20,705
You actually expect me to do this?
You expect me to do it like this?

790
00:53:20,706 --> 00:53:23,044
This is seriously absurd.

791
00:53:23,045 --> 00:53:28,211
- This is just...
- This is just beyond ridiculous.

792
00:53:28,212 --> 00:53:31,398
- Wait? You want me to step up?
- Yes, step up onto the step.

793
00:53:31,399 --> 00:53:33,173
[Ha Gil Dong is standing in front
of his fateful first step.]

794
00:53:33,174 --> 00:53:35,987
- The rain is making the ground slippery.
- You really need to be careful.

795
00:53:36,603 --> 00:53:39,289
- Is there nothing on the other side?
- No, there's only one rope.

796
00:53:39,290 --> 00:53:41,855
You only have one rope to hold onto
as you cross over.

797
00:53:41,856 --> 00:53:44,767
- I have to step up again?
- You have one more step.

798
00:53:44,768 --> 00:53:47,979
That's just empty air!

799
00:53:50,574 --> 00:53:52,354
[Was I like that too?]

800
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:56,615
- Ha Ha.
- Yes?

801
00:53:56,616 --> 00:54:01,319
You'll be given a hint if you cross over,
but you may give up right now as well.

802
00:54:02,475 --> 00:54:05,896
- I can cross over however I want?
- But you can't let go of the rope.

803
00:54:09,530 --> 00:54:11,822
How am I supposed to do this!

804
00:54:12,460 --> 00:54:15,143
Why are you Running Man
producers doing this?

805
00:54:15,144 --> 00:54:17,502
You guys don't even know
what you're doing anymore.

806
00:54:19,316 --> 00:54:21,493
I don't think I can do this!

807
00:54:24,086 --> 00:54:26,736
No, not that way!

808
00:54:27,342 --> 00:54:29,828
- Your foot is pointed the wrong way.
- What?

809
00:54:29,829 --> 00:54:32,476
- Watch out, Dong Hoon!
- I don't think I can do this!

810
00:54:32,477 --> 00:54:35,530
I really couldn't do it myself either.

811
00:54:35,531 --> 00:54:38,760
- I can't do it! I give up!
- Are you giving up?

812
00:54:39,316 --> 00:54:44,186
- Give up by shouting it three times.
- Give up, give up, give up!

813
00:54:44,187 --> 00:54:46,416
[Ha Gil Dong fails the mission.]

814
00:54:46,417 --> 00:54:49,542
- I seriously can't do it. I'm too scared!
- I gave up, too.

815
00:54:49,543 --> 00:54:53,357
- No, it's too scary. Don't let go!
- What the heck is this?

816
00:54:59,297 --> 00:55:01,736
[This is fun!]

817
00:55:01,737 --> 00:55:05,245
Ugh, I know how humiliating
that feels.

818
00:55:05,246 --> 00:55:08,440
[Rage and humiliation.]

819
00:55:08,441 --> 00:55:11,121
- Ha Ha, how angry do you feel?
- I know exactly how that feels.

820
00:55:11,122 --> 00:55:13,633
[We're well aware of how that feels...]

821
00:55:13,634 --> 00:55:15,533
You can just jump down from there.

822
00:55:16,235 --> 00:55:18,693
Standing there will only
make you feel even more pathetic.

823
00:55:18,694 --> 00:55:21,315
- He looks so pitiful.
- Where is there a hole in the wall?

824
00:55:21,316 --> 00:55:23,739
I really want to crawl into a hole.

825
00:55:24,259 --> 00:55:30,314
[Unlike Ha Ha, who sets the new record in
giving up in the quickest amount of time...]

826
00:55:30,315 --> 00:55:34,480
[Mr. Capable and Ace don't even
hesitate in their attempts.]

827
00:55:34,481 --> 00:55:36,582
Are you not even afraid just
because you can't see anything?

828
00:55:36,583 --> 00:55:39,974
[Mr. Capable and Ace easily
succeeds their mission.]

829
00:55:39,975 --> 00:55:42,793
- What's wrong with her?
- She is seriously so weird.

830
00:55:44,162 --> 00:55:45,887
- Who is it?
- It's Suk Jin.

831
00:55:45,888 --> 00:55:47,748
- Is Batman coming?
- Suk Jin!

832
00:55:47,749 --> 00:55:50,944
- This is just crazy.
- Are you locked up there?

833
00:55:50,945 --> 00:55:54,686
Only Jong Kook and Ji Hyo succeeded,
and the rest of us failed.

834
00:55:54,687 --> 00:55:58,552
- It's a mission to test your courage.
- I can't cross that.

835
00:55:58,553 --> 00:56:01,680
No, way!
I can't cross that while blindfolded.

836
00:56:02,416 --> 00:56:05,240
[Jitman falls for it hook, line, and sinker.]

837
00:56:05,241 --> 00:56:09,113
- Did you guys cross it?
- Jae Suk, Kwang Soo and I, all failed.

838
00:56:09,114 --> 00:56:12,842
You have to be extra careful because it's
even more slippery with all the rain.

839
00:56:12,843 --> 00:56:14,581
I'm sorry, but I can't do this.

840
00:56:14,783 --> 00:56:20,261
I can't do it with my eyes wide open,
so how can I do it while blindfolded?

841
00:56:20,262 --> 00:56:22,578
- You want me to go up there?
- Yes, just walk into the building.

842
00:56:23,564 --> 00:56:26,704
This is crazy, I can't do this.
Ji Hyo actually succeeded?

843
00:56:28,116 --> 00:56:30,663
Being a hero is a real tough work.

844
00:56:30,664 --> 00:56:33,258
Being a hero isn't for everybody.

845
00:56:33,874 --> 00:56:36,886
My heart's pounding too hard,
and I don't think I can do this.

846
00:56:36,887 --> 00:56:38,749
- Ji Suk Jin.
- Yes?

847
00:56:38,750 --> 00:56:41,766
It's a sturdy plank, but it may be slippery,
so you need to be very cautious.

848
00:56:41,767 --> 00:56:44,385
I can't do this. I've told you
repeatedly that I can't do it.

849
00:56:44,386 --> 00:56:47,024
Just get up there for now because
you have to at least attempt it.

850
00:56:47,025 --> 00:56:50,278
- Suk Jin, we gave up too.
- We couldn't do it.

851
00:56:50,279 --> 00:56:52,894
Ji Hyo and Jong Kook were the only two
who were able to successfully do it.

852
00:56:52,895 --> 00:56:55,872
I keep telling them that I can't do it
but they still keep leading me up there.

853
00:56:55,873 --> 00:57:00,716
- This is very dangerous.
- This is an absolutely impossible mission.

854
00:57:00,717 --> 00:57:06,332
- This is a very dangerous mission.
- Especially on a rainy day like this?

855
00:57:06,333 --> 00:57:08,996
My shoes have rubber soles,
so they're extra slippery too.

856
00:57:08,997 --> 00:57:13,405
- Listen to how shaky my voice is.
- Only two people actually did it.

857
00:57:13,406 --> 00:57:20,040
- Only Kim Jong Kook and Ji Hyo did it.
- Wait... this is... but I...

858
00:57:21,301 --> 00:57:25,853
Suk Jin, I almost fell down twice,
so you really need to be careful.

859
00:57:26,502 --> 00:57:29,351
I really have to do this?
I can't just give up right here?

860
00:57:29,352 --> 00:57:32,931
Ha Ha, Kwang-vatar, and I
couldn't do it.

861
00:57:32,932 --> 00:57:36,423
- Is this the plank?
- It's really slippery in the middle.

862
00:57:36,424 --> 00:57:40,308
But keep in mind that once you start,
you can't turn around and go back.

863
00:57:40,624 --> 00:57:43,225
Doing this will help me
toughen up my image, won't it?

864
00:57:43,226 --> 00:57:48,174
- No, I doubt that's going to happen.
- How is that going to change your image?

865
00:57:51,248 --> 00:57:54,305
We're not forcing you to do this,
so think about it very carefully.

866
00:57:54,306 --> 00:57:58,257
- Suk Jin! That's how far we got, too.
- Then I can quit right now?

867
00:57:58,258 --> 00:58:01,033
- Me too!
- I honestly think I can do it.

868
00:58:01,034 --> 00:58:03,953
- Okay, give it a try.
- Suk Jin may be able to pull it off.

869
00:58:07,027 --> 00:58:10,575
- What are you doing?
- That's even more dangerous!

870
00:58:10,576 --> 00:58:13,718
- What are you doing?
- Are there two ropes or just one?

871
00:58:15,392 --> 00:58:17,898
- I'm seriously going to do this.
- Okay, do it.

872
00:58:17,899 --> 00:58:20,706
- Give it a try.
- I think I can do this.

873
00:58:20,707 --> 00:58:23,053
It's not like I can even see
how scary things are.

874
00:58:23,054 --> 00:58:26,985
- You really have to be careful!
- No, that's the wrong spot!

875
00:58:26,986 --> 00:58:29,789
- This isn't it?
- You have to get in the right direction.

876
00:58:29,790 --> 00:58:33,187
- This is seriously crazy.
- This is it, isn't it?

877
00:58:33,188 --> 00:58:37,347
- Just check the safety of the plank!
- As long as this is stable...

878
00:58:37,348 --> 00:58:43,151
If I can successfully pull this off,
then my life as a hero will be validated!

879
00:58:43,152 --> 00:58:46,740
Yes, there you go!
Little more to the other side!

880
00:58:46,741 --> 00:58:50,244
That's where it gets slippery!
It gets narrower towards the other end.

881
00:58:50,747 --> 00:58:56,982
- You guys are being too distracting.
- This is all because of Jong Kook and Ji Hyo.

882
00:58:56,983 --> 00:59:01,639
- No, this has nothing to do with me.
- I really wanted to do this...

883
00:59:01,640 --> 00:59:04,771
Just do it next time when
you're better than you are now.

884
00:59:04,772 --> 00:59:08,276
- It's too dangerous.
- You actually did pretty decent.

885
00:59:08,277 --> 00:59:12,358
- You actually did better than any one of us.
- Stop lying to me!

886
00:59:12,359 --> 00:59:14,586
[Jitman goes back to the starting line.]

887
00:59:14,587 --> 00:59:16,362
I feel really shaky right now.

888
00:59:16,363 --> 00:59:20,418
Trying to be this courageous,
and that really isn't me.

889
00:59:20,419 --> 00:59:23,072
- Yes, you're right.
- This isn't me. I was being too brave.

890
00:59:23,073 --> 00:59:25,194
Let just go back to who I normally am.

891
00:59:25,860 --> 00:59:28,296
Give up, give up, give up.

892
00:59:28,297 --> 00:59:30,427
[Jitman gives up and fails the mission.]

893
00:59:30,428 --> 00:59:33,894
Let's all give Suk Jin a round of applause
for remaining so courageous.

894
00:59:33,895 --> 00:59:35,538
- You did great.
- Can I give it another try?

895
00:59:35,539 --> 00:59:38,583
No, you can't.
Take off your blindfold and see if you can.

896
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:50,261
- Seriously.
- Isn't it so embarrassing?

897
00:59:50,937 --> 00:59:54,102
But it's such a relief to me to know
that I'm not the only one.

898
00:59:57,187 --> 00:59:59,348
My son will probably watch this...

899
01:00:02,273 --> 01:00:06,134
That really is embarrassing.
I succeeded, but I still felt embarrassed.

900
01:00:06,135 --> 01:00:08,811
I've been telling my son
to live his life more courageously...

901
01:00:09,585 --> 01:00:12,008
It's okay, it's because you
lost your powers.

902
01:00:15,385 --> 01:00:18,027
[The final hero of the day,
Gae Oh Gong makes his appearance.]

903
01:00:18,727 --> 01:00:21,787
- Gary!
- What is it? Are you all up there?

904
01:00:22,345 --> 01:00:24,548
- This is just ridiculous.
- You have to cross this plank.

905
01:00:24,549 --> 01:00:27,028
- Just look at how high up it is.
- This is no joke.

906
01:00:27,029 --> 01:00:31,977
You have to cross this bridge over here.
This is the bridge.

907
01:00:31,978 --> 01:00:35,567
- We all failed.
- What? That's ridiculous.

908
01:00:35,568 --> 01:00:40,160
- Why are you doing this to us?
Only Jong Kook and Ji Hyo succeeded.

909
01:00:42,496 --> 01:00:45,677
I can't cross that while blindfolded.
That's crazy.

910
01:00:46,895 --> 01:00:49,130
What is this?

911
01:00:49,828 --> 01:00:53,245
- Don't push yourself too hard, Gary.
- Gary's scared of things like this too.

912
01:00:53,808 --> 01:00:56,344
[Gae Oh Gong suffers from fear of heights
after having lost his powers.]

913
01:00:56,345 --> 01:00:59,531
- How much further?
- Watch out for the steps and be careful!

914
01:00:59,532 --> 01:01:03,433
- Grab onto the rope that's to the left.
- Yes, there you go.

915
01:01:03,434 --> 01:01:06,617
- You have to find your balance.
- There's nothing to the right.

916
01:01:06,618 --> 01:01:10,055
Just hold onto the rope
and walk straight ahead.

917
01:01:10,589 --> 01:01:14,039
- You have to go up one more.
- Go up one more, and you can start walking.

918
01:01:14,040 --> 01:01:17,313
- Find your balance.
- Fighting, Gary.

919
01:01:17,972 --> 01:01:20,002
- That's it right there.
- Be careful.

920
01:01:20,003 --> 01:01:22,869
- That's it.
- This is what I step onto?

921
01:01:22,870 --> 01:01:25,128
- Yes, that's it.
- I think he's going to do it.

922
01:01:25,129 --> 01:01:27,501
- This is crazy.
- Wait, hang on a minute.

923
01:01:27,502 --> 01:01:30,075
What is this!

924
01:01:31,971 --> 01:01:35,287
Why are you doing this to me?
I really hate this!

925
01:01:35,288 --> 01:01:39,539
- No, I can't do this!
- We all gave up, too.

926
01:01:39,540 --> 01:01:43,769
- Just give yourself a break and give up.
- I wanted to accomplish something.

927
01:01:43,770 --> 01:01:46,847
- It's starting to rain pretty hard.
- Be careful.

928
01:01:46,848 --> 01:01:48,950
- I'm going to give it a try.
- Okay.

929
01:01:48,951 --> 01:01:54,571
- It's further than you think.
- You can't turn back after a certain point.

930
01:01:54,572 --> 01:01:57,678
Come a little more to the left.
You're going too far off to the right.

931
01:01:57,679 --> 01:02:01,392
Go off to the side a little bit.
Scoot to the right like a crab would.

932
01:02:01,393 --> 01:02:06,835
- No, hold onto the rope and do it.
- Crab, not dog.

933
01:02:06,836 --> 01:02:09,531
- This is scary.
- No, you're doing fine.

934
01:02:09,532 --> 01:02:13,952
- You're too far from the rope. Stick closer.
- Like this?

935
01:02:13,953 --> 01:02:17,050
- You're getting closer to the middle.
- Scream on the count of three.

936
01:02:17,051 --> 01:02:21,339
- What is it?
- Oh no!

937
01:02:21,340 --> 01:02:24,474
- What is it?
- Just hold on.

938
01:02:24,475 --> 01:02:27,601
- No, you can't do it.
- Just sit down where you're at.

939
01:02:27,602 --> 01:02:30,253
What am I going to do?
I can't sit down here.

940
01:02:30,254 --> 01:02:33,944
- Don't let go of the rope.
- It's because of the wind and the rain.

941
01:02:33,945 --> 01:02:37,405
- Is it unsteady up there?
- It's the worst in the middle.

942
01:02:39,139 --> 01:02:43,266
[Works through his fear to finally
bring himself to the bell at the end!]

943
01:02:43,886 --> 01:02:46,364
[Gae Oh Gong succeeds his mission.]

944
01:02:48,551 --> 01:02:51,662
What the heck is this!

945
01:02:51,663 --> 01:02:55,662
[The shame and the humiliation
comes crashing though.]

946
01:02:55,663 --> 01:02:58,422
What are you guys doing?
Seriously!

947
01:02:58,423 --> 01:03:01,585
What were you guys thinking!

948
01:03:01,585 --> 01:03:02,996
[It's okay, everyone else
went through it too.]

949
01:03:03,506 --> 01:03:06,381
[Test of courage now comes to a close.]

950
01:03:07,930 --> 01:03:10,630
Only those who successfully passed
the mission can see this hint.

951
01:03:10,631 --> 01:03:14,160
Okay, since Yoo Jae Suk is closest,
come take a look.

952
01:03:14,412 --> 01:03:16,644
Ugh, I'm so embarrassed.

953
01:03:16,645 --> 01:03:20,301
[Man-made island.]

954
01:03:20,569 --> 01:03:22,965
[Second hint: Man-made Island.]

955
01:03:26,287 --> 01:03:30,105
[Heroes' final mission.]

956
01:03:30,106 --> 01:03:31,653
- This is the last one?
- It's the last mission.

957
01:03:31,654 --> 01:03:36,883
<i>You will either find the final clue directing
you to where you can get your powers back</i>

958
01:03:36,884 --> 01:03:38,661
<i>or you may fail the mission.</i>

959
01:03:38,662 --> 01:03:43,684
<i>The seven heroes will run in a relay form
to beat the bus through one bus stop.</i>

960
01:03:43,685 --> 01:03:49,195
<i>When the first runner gets off the bus
and passes the baton off to the second runner</i>

961
01:03:49,196 --> 01:03:51,932
<i>then the race will carry on in that
manner to the very last runner</i>

962
01:03:51,933 --> 01:03:57,970
<i>and the seventh runner will have to board
the bus the first runner got off of to win.</i>

963
01:04:00,242 --> 01:04:02,578
I'll show you a map of the route.

964
01:04:02,579 --> 01:04:07,080
- You will see the marks noting the spots.
- Wow, it's a long route.

965
01:04:07,081 --> 01:04:12,443
- Look at how long the route is.
- You have to run this whole route.

966
01:04:12,444 --> 01:04:14,702
[Distance between the two bus stops.]

967
01:04:14,703 --> 01:04:18,266
- That's a really far distance.
- It's one stop, but it's still very far.

968
01:04:18,267 --> 01:04:22,491
I remember leaving my umbrella on the bus
when I was a second year in high school

969
01:04:22,492 --> 01:04:25,829
and I actually ran and caught up
to the bus to get my umbrella back.

970
01:04:25,830 --> 01:04:27,948
- Why do you lie like that?
- Are you sure the bus wasn't at a stop?

971
01:04:27,949 --> 01:04:29,625
Why would I lie about that?

972
01:04:29,626 --> 01:04:32,758
It's also very important to determine
which order all of you will run in.

973
01:04:32,759 --> 01:04:37,738
- There are a couple of turns in the route.
- The best runner takes the longest part.

974
01:04:37,739 --> 01:04:40,374
I'm sorry, but my knee is really sore lately,
so I think you're going to have to do it.

975
01:04:40,375 --> 01:04:42,952
If you're not feeling well, then
who in here could be feeling well?

976
01:04:43,742 --> 01:04:46,812
What if I can't hear any traffic
since I can't hear anything with this?

977
01:04:46,813 --> 01:04:51,299
- I can't hear anything either.
- What kind of heroes are we?

978
01:04:51,300 --> 01:04:54,527
[This group of heroes are more frail
and delicate than regular people.]

979
01:04:55,318 --> 01:05:00,258
- Do this is the starting line?
- Can you run to this point?

980
01:05:00,259 --> 01:05:05,004
- How about at this point?
- Someone needs to take over here.

981
01:05:06,528 --> 01:05:09,196
This is our first stop.
Ha Ha needs to get off.

982
01:05:09,197 --> 01:05:11,127
- Bye.
- We'll see you later.

983
01:05:11,128 --> 01:05:13,680
Fighting!

984
01:05:13,681 --> 01:05:16,221
Heroes, fighting!

985
01:05:16,222 --> 01:05:19,411
- Dong Hoon, run extra for me.
- Okay.

986
01:05:19,412 --> 01:05:22,314
[Ha Gil Dong's swift feet are needed.]

987
01:05:22,315 --> 01:05:25,512
- Okay, the Germ Man is getting off.
- I'm Batman!

988
01:05:25,513 --> 01:05:27,601
I'm not a Germ Man.

989
01:05:28,071 --> 01:05:32,069
[Fourth runner, Ace Wonder Blank.]

990
01:05:32,070 --> 01:05:34,501
[Fifth runner-
Kkuk-verine with a bad knee.]

991
01:05:34,502 --> 01:05:36,866
- I'm feeling nervous.
- Yes, me too.

992
01:05:36,867 --> 01:05:40,687
- What am I getting so nervous for?
- I bet my honor as a hero on the line!

993
01:05:41,952 --> 01:05:45,420
[Kwang-vatar attempts to say
hello to the baby.]

994
01:05:47,691 --> 01:05:50,142
Okay, I'm sorry!

995
01:05:50,143 --> 01:05:53,645
[Kwang-vatar's immediate apology.]

996
01:05:53,646 --> 01:05:58,357
- I'm so sorry!
- Forgot how you may frighten people.

997
01:05:58,867 --> 01:06:01,045
- I'm sorry.
- He's sorry.

998
01:06:01,691 --> 01:06:04,269
[That blue man is too scary.]

999
01:06:04,687 --> 01:06:09,300
[On the other hand, Kkuk-verine
is gaining quite the popularity.]

1000
01:06:10,154 --> 01:06:13,679
[Kkuk-verine makes many new memories
while waiting for the mission to start.]

1001
01:06:14,425 --> 01:06:17,212
[Heroes, are you ready?]

1002
01:06:17,213 --> 01:06:20,721
Is everyone ready?
Number one is clear.

1003
01:06:20,722 --> 01:06:24,343
- Number two, clear.
- Number three, clear.

1004
01:06:24,344 --> 01:06:28,294
- Number four, clear.
- Number five, clear.

1005
01:06:28,295 --> 01:06:31,468
- Number six, clear.
- Number seven, clara.

1006
01:06:33,368 --> 01:06:37,955
- What are you doing!
- You guys said that at the same time.

1007
01:06:37,956 --> 01:06:42,420
[Getting down to the wire!
Beat the bus and save the earth!]

1008
01:06:43,624 --> 01:06:46,666
[The key to victory-
First runner- Gae Oh Gong.]

1009
01:06:46,667 --> 01:06:49,494
The stupid tail!

1010
01:06:49,495 --> 01:06:51,232
[What's needed right now is
Ha Gil Dong's speed!]

1011
01:06:51,233 --> 01:06:55,623
[But the ever-unpredictable Jitman
is looking extremely nervous.]

1012
01:06:56,562 --> 01:06:58,036
I'm nervous.

1013
01:06:58,752 --> 01:07:01,721
[Kkuk-verine... I can do this.]

1014
01:07:02,425 --> 01:07:05,629
- Okay, get to your station.
- I didn't know where to go.

1015
01:07:06,760 --> 01:07:10,647
[Rushing over to help the grandmother takes
precedence over the mission for Kwang-vatar.]

1016
01:07:10,648 --> 01:07:13,028
Thank you.

1017
01:07:14,781 --> 01:07:17,043
No, not at all.
Please be careful.

1018
01:07:17,044 --> 01:07:18,913
[A very well-mannered Avatar from Pandora.]

1019
01:07:19,642 --> 01:07:23,735
I feel like my heart is going to pound
out of my chest. Please get going.

1020
01:07:23,736 --> 01:07:27,579
My hands are like blocks of ice
because I'm feeling so nervous.

1021
01:07:30,838 --> 01:07:35,617
Okay, I'm about to get on the bus.
Everyone get ready.

1022
01:07:37,095 --> 01:07:42,121
Get on this one? Getting on
the bus right now, so get ready!

1023
01:07:42,122 --> 01:07:44,495
Bus 5516.

1024
01:07:44,496 --> 01:07:46,743
[Gae Oh Gong boards the bus.]

1025
01:07:46,744 --> 01:07:49,378
There aren't that many people on
the bus, so we're in big trouble.

1026
01:07:49,782 --> 01:07:52,879
This bus is pretty empty.
We're in trouble.

1027
01:07:54,464 --> 01:07:59,228
There aren't any cars in the right lane.
We may actually lose this mission.

1028
01:07:59,229 --> 01:08:02,156
[Not many cars out on the road?]

1029
01:08:02,682 --> 01:08:06,896
I don't see a single car on the road
between Ha Ha and myself.

1030
01:08:08,571 --> 01:08:11,585
[Situation alert! This means
the bus could drive much faster!]

1031
01:08:12,671 --> 01:08:15,070
There aren't any cars out
on the road.

1032
01:08:18,338 --> 01:08:21,635
The street by me is pretty packed.

1033
01:08:21,636 --> 01:08:25,866
I'm getting ready to get off the bus,
so everyone get ready.

1034
01:08:25,867 --> 01:08:29,579
- Gary is about to get off the bus.
- Get ready!

1035
01:08:30,892 --> 01:08:34,399

[Making the final turn!]

1037
01:08:40,968 --> 01:08:45,561
- The bus is turning!
- Here it comes!

[Stay energized with
the cheer from the fans.]

What do I do?

1041
01:08:55,917 --> 01:08:57,957

[Yoo-perman's sensitive stomach acts up
with his state of nervousness.]

1043

Here it is!
I see it coming!

1044
01:09:06,387 --> 01:09:08,863

[Their hearts are about to burst out of
their chests from nervousness.]

A big crowd is starting to gather in.

1049
01:09:24,327 --> 01:09:26,777
We didn't even get stuck at the light.

1050
01:09:27,695 --> 01:09:29,565
No light.

1051
01:09:29,679 --> 01:09:33,776
[Gae Oh Gong is off the bus.]

1052
01:09:34,507 --> 01:09:36,617
Okay, here we go!

He's headed this way!
I'm hanging up!

1058
01:09:57,935 --> 01:09:59,777
Everyone out of my way.

[Gae Oh Gong's final spurt of speed.]

1060
01:10:04,447 --> 01:10:06,781
No, slow down a little bit!

- There are high, mid and low hints.
- We'll take the high.

1133
01:15:37,185 --> 01:15:42,281
There are two high hints, three mid hints,
and two low hints.

1134
01:15:42,282 --> 01:15:46,236
If you had failed the mission, then
everyone would've gotten the low hint.

1135
01:15:46,237 --> 01:15:48,392
Gary, please step forward.

1136
01:15:48,393 --> 01:15:51,073
[What are the hints pointing
to the final destination?]

1137
01:15:51,394 --> 01:15:55,473
[Two low hints- Chae Ga Sol.
Kwang-vatar and Gae Oh Gong.]

1138
01:15:55,474 --> 01:15:57,694
We'll take a look together.

1139
01:15:57,695 --> 01:15:59,525
[The three islands.]

1140
01:15:59,526 --> 01:16:02,695
[Jitman, Ha Dong Gil, Wonder Blank.]

1141
01:16:02,696 --> 01:16:08,618
[Between Banpo Bridge and
Dongjak Bridge.]

1142
01:16:08,619 --> 01:16:11,102
[Top hints- Yoo-perman and Kkuk-verine.]

1143
01:16:11,103 --> 01:16:16,442
Please whisper to me where you think
these hints are indicating to.

1144
01:16:16,876 --> 01:16:19,528
Ha Ha, you don't know?

1145
01:16:19,529 --> 01:16:21,580
The three islands.

1146
01:16:25,070 --> 01:16:30,258
Yoo Jae Suk, you can get in the white car,
and Wolverine can get in the grey car.

1147
01:16:30,259 --> 01:16:32,480
Really?
Seriously?

1148
01:16:32,481 --> 01:16:35,835
Okay, next.
Tell me where you think it is.

1149
01:16:35,836 --> 01:16:38,274
Can I just get in the white car?

1150
01:16:38,685 --> 01:16:42,818
Just tell me your answer instead of
asking me which car you can ride in.

1151
01:16:42,819 --> 01:16:46,074
[Kwang-vatar, you have to
say your answer...]

1152
01:16:46,694 --> 01:16:51,675
[White car- Correct answer car.
Grey car- Wrong answer car.]

1153
01:16:51,676 --> 01:16:57,400
I don't know if they're behind us, but
they're headed elsewhere, aren't they?

1154
01:16:58,149 --> 01:17:02,080
- But they might know where they're going.
- Then we just need to get there first.

1155
01:17:02,081 --> 01:17:04,601
We just need to get our powers back.
Gae Oh Gong...

1156
01:17:05,309 --> 01:17:09,339
with Yoo-perman and Wonder Blank.

1157
01:17:11,644 --> 01:17:16,660
Jae Suk kept saying that he knew where
it was before he even received his last hint.

1158
01:17:16,661 --> 01:17:19,685
[Yoo-perman seems a little suspicious?]

1159
01:17:19,686 --> 01:17:22,988
[Then it must mean that Yoo-perman
is the Anti-hero!]

1160
01:17:22,989 --> 01:17:26,033
- He has to be the one
- Let me tell you something.

1161
01:17:27,491 --> 01:17:31,469
- What's between Dongjak and Banpo Bridge?
- Let's ask someone.

1162
01:17:32,957 --> 01:17:36,646
- Ask if there are any man-made islands.
- Can I ask you something?

1163
01:17:36,647 --> 01:17:39,891
- Where the lights gather in the winter.
- The three islands.

1164
01:17:39,892 --> 01:17:41,941
- The three light island?
- What did you say?

1165
01:17:41,942 --> 01:17:45,203
- The three light islands?
- That's it!

1166
01:17:45,204 --> 01:17:47,915
[Finally figures out the final location
with the help of these kind students.]

1167
01:17:47,916 --> 01:17:50,891
- Yes, that's right!
- Thank you!

1168
01:17:51,277 --> 01:17:55,191
[Let's go and reclaim our lost powers!]

1169
01:17:55,192 --> 01:17:59,115
- Is this where we can get our powers back?
- Let's see.

1170
01:17:59,116 --> 01:18:06,511
Will we be able to break this bondage
and regain our superpowers once again?

1171
01:18:06,512 --> 01:18:08,389
[Did a meteor really crash
somewhere around here?]

1172
01:18:08,701 --> 01:18:10,667
- What's this?
- What is that?

1173
01:18:11,737 --> 01:18:15,118
[The ice capsules that kept the superheroes
prisoners for hundreds of years?]

1174
01:18:17,867 --> 01:18:20,175
- Kwang-vatar.
- Jae Suk.

1175
01:18:20,176 --> 01:18:23,688
- Germ Man, you finally showed up.
- You're the Anti-hero!

1176
01:18:23,689 --> 01:18:26,374
[The heroes are starting to
suspect one another.]

1177
01:18:26,375 --> 01:18:30,388
- The Anti-hero is amongst us, isn't he?
- I see that you all made it.

1178
01:18:31,538 --> 01:18:34,114
[The Anti-hero's voice?]

1179
01:18:34,115 --> 01:18:38,575
The time for you to regain your
superpowers has come.

1180
01:18:39,120 --> 01:18:43,266
That fateful moment is only
three minutes away.

1181
01:18:44,620 --> 01:18:47,234
[The meteor will
crash down in three minutes.]

1182
01:18:49,337 --> 01:18:55,556
Find an 'R' marked chair to sit on within
three minutes to regain your lost powers!

1183
01:18:55,557 --> 01:18:58,300
Wow, some of these chairs
are specially marked.

1184
01:18:58,301 --> 01:19:03,349
Do you also know what I told only to
Kwang-vatar this morning?

1185
01:19:04,370 --> 01:19:07,645
The chairs in which you can
regain your superpowers...

1186
01:19:07,646 --> 01:19:11,003
there are only six of them.

1187
01:19:12,118 --> 01:19:18,625
There are only six chairs that you can use
to regain your lost superpowers.

1188
01:19:19,591 --> 01:19:22,201
What do you think is more important?

1189
01:19:22,202 --> 01:19:24,913
I hope that you make the right decision.

1190
01:19:26,785 --> 01:19:29,634
If you were going to tell everyone,
then why did you tell me?

1191
01:19:29,635 --> 01:19:33,605
You've only got three minutes
from this moment.

1192
01:19:33,606 --> 01:19:35,433
Can we look under these tarps?

1193
01:19:35,434 --> 01:19:39,228
[The final stage to reclaiming their powers.]

1194
01:19:39,229 --> 01:19:41,863
[Find and sit on one of the six
'R' marked chairs.]

1195
01:19:44,078 --> 01:19:46,864
[Lifting up all the sheets, but none
of the chairs are specially marked.]

1196
01:19:55,580 --> 01:19:58,071
[Ha Gil Dong is the first
to find one of the six chairs.]

1197
01:19:59,762 --> 01:20:02,175
[Jitman finds a chair of his own
soon thereafter.]

1198
01:20:02,646 --> 01:20:04,403
Okay, I found it!

1199
01:20:07,530 --> 01:20:09,184
I got one!

1200
01:20:09,735 --> 01:20:12,059
Are there only two left?

1201
01:20:13,286 --> 01:20:17,271
[There heroes still left without a chair.]

1202
01:20:17,272 --> 01:20:19,512
[Only two chairs are left to be found.]

1203
01:20:19,513 --> 01:20:21,769
- Something doesn't feel right.
- This was way too easy.

1204
01:20:23,884 --> 01:20:26,885
[There is a hidden secret to this mission...]

1205
01:20:29,346 --> 01:20:31,967
[Wonder Blank finds her own chair.]

1206
01:20:34,189 --> 01:20:35,848
[Just then, Ha Gil Dong discovers
something.]

1207
01:20:35,849 --> 01:20:38,750
There's a pattern!
We have to figure out the pattern.

1208
01:20:38,751 --> 01:20:42,039
- I'm next to you, Jae Suk.
- Come here, Ji Hyo.

1209
01:20:43,965 --> 01:20:46,688
[What meaning does this pattern hold?]

1210
01:20:48,667 --> 01:20:50,727
Everyone sit down.

1211
01:20:51,691 --> 01:20:54,859
[The meteor is getting closer!]

1212
01:20:56,837 --> 01:21:01,522
[The last remaining marked chair
is nowhere to be found...]

1213
01:21:02,781 --> 01:21:06,010
- Should we help find the last chair?
- But we've all got ours already.

1214
01:21:07,208 --> 01:21:09,862
[Ha Gil Dong attempts to help
find the last remaining chair.]

1215
01:21:10,739 --> 01:21:13,372
- It's right here.
- Then bring it over.

1216
01:21:13,373 --> 01:21:16,836
- Hey, come here!
- I bet the Giraffe did something.

1217
01:21:16,837 --> 01:21:19,298
- Come here!
- What is it?

1218
01:21:25,046 --> 01:21:28,393
[Kwang-vatar runs over to claim his seat.]

1219
01:21:28,792 --> 01:21:31,303
[Gae Oh Gong arrives too late
and is left without a seat of his own.]

1220
01:21:31,304 --> 01:21:34,594
There are only these six chairs.

1221
01:21:35,388 --> 01:21:38,427
- There are six chairs.
- Should we move this one over there?

1222
01:21:38,428 --> 01:21:40,497
[Is the black and white pattern
the key to this mystery?]

1223
01:21:40,498 --> 01:21:44,334
- Move this one over there.
- Over here, Ha Ha.

1224
01:21:45,552 --> 01:21:49,885
[Moving while still seated out of his fear
of getting his seat stolen away.]

1225
01:21:49,886 --> 01:21:52,549
- Why do we need to match this?
- There's no need for that, is there?

1226
01:21:52,550 --> 01:21:55,878
- We just need to match all this.
- Then one person doesn't have a seat?

1227
01:21:55,879 --> 01:21:58,879
[The meteor is about to crash down!]

1228
01:21:59,659 --> 01:22:01,977
[There is no more time!]

1229
01:22:05,315 --> 01:22:08,463
[Seven distinct black and white pattern!]

1230
01:22:09,053 --> 01:22:11,402
[With the pattern complete,
there are a total of seven seats.]

1231
01:22:12,623 --> 01:22:15,544
We succeeded in making seven seats!

1232
01:22:15,545 --> 01:22:19,622
- An Anti-hero can't get in our way.
- We are as one!

1233
01:22:21,066 --> 01:22:23,010
[The fateful moment has arrived.]

1234
01:22:32,220 --> 01:22:37,860
[The heroes regain their lost superpowers!]

1235
01:22:37,861 --> 01:22:42,004
[The magic of using six chairs
to create seven seats out of it.]

1236
01:22:43,674 --> 01:22:48,880
- I don't know why, but I'm disappointed.
- I'm actually starting to tear up.

1237
01:22:48,881 --> 01:22:51,450
But I saw you moving with
the seat stuck to your butt.

1238
01:22:55,706 --> 01:23:03,638
[Thus... the heroes regained
their lost powers.]

1239
01:23:05,052 --> 01:23:09,511
[But... he can't fly, can he?]

1240
