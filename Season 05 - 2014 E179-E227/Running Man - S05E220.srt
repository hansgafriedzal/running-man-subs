1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,915
Running Man

2
00:00:02,251 --> 00:00:07,622
[In an instant...]

3
00:00:07,623 --> 00:00:12,217
[all humanity vanished into thin air.]

4
00:00:13,232 --> 00:00:16,641
[Korea's Nodeul Island.]

5
00:00:19,987 --> 00:00:24,503
[In a tranquil place where only the
sounds of raindrops are heard...]

6
00:00:24,504 --> 00:00:30,408
[traces of humanity are found.]

7
00:00:32,682 --> 00:00:34,544
Hello!

8
00:00:34,545 --> 00:00:36,455
Is anyone out there?

9
00:00:37,654 --> 00:00:39,939
Is there anyone out here?

10
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:41,991
Mom!

11
00:00:41,992 --> 00:00:45,047
[Six men are drawn to Nodeul Island
by some mystical force.]

12
00:00:45,048 --> 00:00:46,899
What is going on here?

13
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:48,939
Am I left alone on this earth?

14
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:52,190
Is anyone out there?
Anyone?

15
00:00:52,191 --> 00:00:56,735
[These are humanity's last men standing.]

16
00:00:58,149 --> 00:01:03,305
[And on this island, lives
humanity's final six women.]

17
00:01:07,293 --> 00:01:09,144
It's been a while.

18
00:01:09,145 --> 00:01:12,032
[Jong Sook- 39 years old.
One of the final female survivors.]

19
00:01:12,033 --> 00:01:13,722
Hello.

20
00:01:13,723 --> 00:01:16,142
[Hana- 36 years old.
One of the final female survivors.]

21
00:01:16,143 --> 00:01:18,024
It's been a while since I've made
an appearance on Running Man.

22
00:01:18,025 --> 00:01:19,634
My name is Lee Kwang Ja.

23
00:01:19,635 --> 00:01:21,193
[Kwang Ja- 30 years old.]

24
00:01:21,194 --> 00:01:23,358
Hello.
[Gae Eun- 37 years old.]

25
00:01:23,393 --> 00:01:25,120
[Ji Hyo- 34 years old.]

26
00:01:25,121 --> 00:01:28,272
I'm so hungry and cold.
[Jae Soon- 43 years old.]

27
00:01:28,273 --> 00:01:32,946
The thought of having to endure and
survive through this is very difficult.

28
00:01:33,367 --> 00:01:37,295
Being with all these women
are very troublesome.

29
00:01:37,296 --> 00:01:42,521
[What's the biggest difficulty?]
- Having to look at their ugly faces all year.

30
00:01:42,522 --> 00:01:46,907
And also... they're
starting to stink like men.

31
00:01:48,457 --> 00:01:52,628
I think having me around is
alleviating their worry for food.

32
00:01:52,629 --> 00:01:57,646
I built these homes myself,
and everything else that you see here.

33
00:01:58,834 --> 00:02:01,846
I don't know if it's because
there aren't any men around...

34
00:02:01,847 --> 00:02:05,367
but I think my body is starting to develop
male hormones and testosterone.

35
00:02:07,891 --> 00:02:12,530
What I need the most as a woman...
is a man!

36
00:02:12,531 --> 00:02:15,946
- I would like a man.
- A nice boyfriend.

37
00:02:15,947 --> 00:02:20,108
I've never once been without a boyfriend
since the minute I was born.

38
00:02:20,109 --> 00:02:23,110
Even when I was in the incubator, I was
seducing the baby in the next incubator.

39
00:02:23,111 --> 00:02:26,122
Where's my knight in shining armor?
Huh?

40
00:02:26,123 --> 00:02:30,198
I wouldn't really know right now
since I don't see any men around

41
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:34,631
but I think if men were to come around,
I'd turn into a head turning femme fatale.

42
00:02:37,093 --> 00:02:41,762
- Seriously... you look just like her.
- You look just like your mother.

43
00:02:41,763 --> 00:02:44,653
- What did you say?
- You look just like your mother, too.

44
00:02:44,654 --> 00:02:46,911
- You look the most like your mother.
- You take just after your mom!

45
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:50,976
[They're all looking very much
like their mothers...]

46
00:02:51,601 --> 00:02:54,444
You are the final six female survivors,
and there are final six male survivors.

47
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:57,046
- I see one of the men heading this way.
- Who is it?

48
00:02:57,047 --> 00:02:58,684
[On an island where it was
only populated by women...]

49
00:02:58,685 --> 00:03:00,837
[A shadow of a man darkens the earth!]

50
00:03:00,838 --> 00:03:03,058
I thought he was an elder
out for his early morning stroll.

51
00:03:03,059 --> 00:03:06,122
- Hello.
- Wow, it's a man!

52
00:03:06,122 --> 00:03:07,655
[First man on the island- Big nose.]

53
00:03:07,656 --> 00:03:09,903
- It's been so long since I've seen a man!
- My goodness!

54
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:15,039
[First man they've seen in a whole year.]

55
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,511
- Why?
- Here comes another one! Who is it?

56
00:03:18,512 --> 00:03:22,400
Ugh, Seriously.
They're all my friends.

57
00:03:22,401 --> 00:03:25,625
[Nation's beloved roughneck-
Jang Dong Min.]

58
00:03:25,626 --> 00:03:28,235
- He's a special guest.
- It's Dong Min.

59
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:31,177
- It's a man!
- What are you doing? Huh?

60
00:03:31,627 --> 00:03:35,669
[Innocent Jong Sook feels uncomfortable with
a touch from an unfamiliar man's touch.]

61
00:03:36,195 --> 00:03:39,575
- Min Gyo!
- Hello!

62
00:03:44,309 --> 00:03:45,915
Show them your eyes once more.

63
00:03:45,916 --> 00:03:48,743
[A man known for his expressive eyes-
Kim Min Gyo.]

64
00:03:50,481 --> 00:03:52,622
- Honey!
- Who is it?

65
00:03:52,623 --> 00:03:55,792
[A man of perfection- Song Jae Rim.]

66
00:03:57,055 --> 00:04:00,013
- How is he so good looking?
- Give him a hug.

67
00:04:01,077 --> 00:04:02,775
Wow, honey!

68
00:04:02,776 --> 00:04:06,104
[Jae Rim is accosted as soon as
he arrives on the island.]

69
00:04:10,024 --> 00:04:11,826
Oh my, you startled me!

70
00:04:13,639 --> 00:04:16,730
[Number one rookie to the variety world-
MIB's Kang Nam.]

71
00:04:16,731 --> 00:04:19,494
- Run!
- I don't know where to go.

72
00:04:20,746 --> 00:04:23,461
- Why is he trying to act cool?
- Hurry up!

73
00:04:23,774 --> 00:04:26,180
[Finally rushing over to the group.]

74
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:32,865
[The dignity of variety shows-
Park Soo Hong.]

75
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:38,586
[We are humanity's six final
male survivors.]

76
00:04:38,587 --> 00:04:40,715
- Have you all been well?
- Yes.

77
00:04:40,716 --> 00:04:43,376
I hope that you've been
saving up your energy.

78
00:04:43,377 --> 00:04:46,959
It's nice seeing you all again
after this past week.

79
00:04:49,214 --> 00:04:52,930
[After this past week?
What does that mean?]

80
00:04:58,902 --> 00:05:02,020
[Exactly one week ago at 6am...]

81
00:05:05,784 --> 00:05:12,129
[The rain pours down from the sky
on the day of Running Man shoot.]

82
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:17,569
[Raining much harder than expected.]

83
00:05:19,381 --> 00:05:23,583
[Staff is having an emergency meeting
to discuss whether to film or not.]

84
00:05:25,268 --> 00:05:28,915
[Ultimately wraps up filming the episode
after pre-show interview due to the rain.]

85
00:05:29,428 --> 00:05:32,528
[Everyone's gathering at
the opening scene location...]

86
00:05:34,814 --> 00:05:36,582
Hello.

87
00:05:37,489 --> 00:05:40,832
[Even the guests are invited over
to join in on the emergency meeting.]

88
00:05:40,833 --> 00:05:43,090
- You're not a girl?
- No, not me.

89
00:05:43,398 --> 00:05:46,352
- Hello, Sir.
- Wow, look at you.

90
00:05:46,353 --> 00:05:48,436
Soo Hong's on the show?

91
00:05:49,774 --> 00:05:53,264
- Look at this guy.
- You look pretty, Gary.

92
00:05:53,265 --> 00:05:56,268
He should be one of the girls,
so why isn't he playing one?

93
00:05:56,269 --> 00:05:58,981
- He'd be perfect as one of the girls.
- I think he would be perfect for the role.

94
00:05:58,982 --> 00:06:01,869
- What is this?
- Hello.

95
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:04,790
[Even Jae Rim seems confused by
what's going on set.]

96
00:06:04,791 --> 00:06:08,662
- Wow, he's so good looking.
- Look at him.

97
00:06:08,663 --> 00:06:18,442
[This actually was...
these survivors' actual first meeting.]

98
00:06:21,619 --> 00:06:26,267
You are the last 12 surviving members
of earth's whole human race.

99
00:06:26,268 --> 00:06:30,431
- How could these be the final survivors?
- I'm going to make him fall in love with me.

100
00:06:30,432 --> 00:06:33,427
Wouldn't it be better to just
let the human race die out?

101
00:06:33,428 --> 00:06:35,352
I have a wife back home.

102
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:37,748
If we really are the last
survivors of the human race

103
00:06:37,749 --> 00:06:41,122
then we're going to have to find some
other ways to keep it going.

104
00:06:41,123 --> 00:06:45,232
How about the men come on the island
to kill all these ugly women?

105
00:06:46,292 --> 00:06:49,914
[Imminent end for the human race-
Humanity's final surviving members.]

106
00:06:51,016 --> 00:06:53,141
- It's raining really hard, isn't it?
- Yes.

107
00:06:53,142 --> 00:06:55,973
- I have something to ask all of you.
- What is it?

108
00:06:55,974 --> 00:06:59,350
- Are you all available next Monday?
- No, what for?

109
00:06:59,351 --> 00:07:04,203
- Are you available next Monday?
- Why are you talking about next Monday?

110
00:07:04,204 --> 00:07:09,766
The reason being, we didn't expect the weather
to be so cold and rainy as it is today.

111
00:07:09,767 --> 00:07:12,169
- We didn't expect this weather at all.
- It's raining really hard.

112
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:16,467
So we're thinking that this weather may
be difficult for you to do your missions in

113
00:07:16,468 --> 00:07:21,487
and more than anything else, we're trying
to work around Jang Dong Min's schedule.

114
00:07:21,488 --> 00:07:24,616
Why? Why are we
working around his schedule?

115
00:07:24,617 --> 00:07:28,295
- Is it because of his work schedule?
- Why do we have to do that?

116
00:07:28,296 --> 00:07:29,723
[No time to wait around for the rain to stop
due to Dong Min's afternoon schedule.]

117
00:07:30,313 --> 00:07:34,292
- Just because of Dong Min?
- It's not like he's Jang Dong Geun!

118
00:07:34,293 --> 00:07:38,546
- It's not like he's famous Jang Dong Geun!
- I know it's hard, but just accept it.

119
00:07:39,359 --> 00:07:41,856
Just keep your mouth shut!

120
00:07:43,756 --> 00:07:46,693
I just saw Soo Hong
giving Dong Min dirty looks.

121
00:07:46,694 --> 00:07:49,099
Seriously, Soo Hong.

122
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:52,107
We'll work out the rest of the details
regarding everyone else's schedules.

123
00:07:52,108 --> 00:07:54,756
Please go home and get plenty of rest.

124
00:07:54,757 --> 00:07:56,738
- Wow, seriously?
- Okay, go home.

125
00:07:56,739 --> 00:07:59,060
- Are you kidding right now?
- This isn't candid camera, is it?

126
00:08:00,529 --> 00:08:03,108
I'm actually getting some time to myself
that my wife won't know about.

127
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:08,886
[Thus, filming for that day got cancelled...]

128
00:08:14,916 --> 00:08:17,296
- Have you all been well?
- Yes.

129
00:08:17,297 --> 00:08:19,910
I hope you all got plenty of rest.

130
00:08:20,397 --> 00:08:23,536
- It's his birthday today.
- It's my birthday today!

131
00:08:25,098 --> 00:08:26,960
[Okay then...]

132
00:08:26,961 --> 00:08:29,424
What are you doing?

133
00:08:31,186 --> 00:08:36,374
It's your birthday today?
Happy 45th birthday to Park Soo Hong!

134
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:38,590
[Park Soo Hong's 45th birthday.]

135
00:08:38,591 --> 00:08:41,310
- Wow, you're older than I had thought.
- I didn't even have a celebration.

136
00:08:41,311 --> 00:08:43,704
You didn't get to have one?
Did you all hear that?

137
00:08:43,705 --> 00:08:46,696
He said, 'celebration',
not 'party'.

138
00:08:46,697 --> 00:08:49,777
[Using terms that old people would use.]

139
00:08:49,778 --> 00:08:52,464
- It's because he's older.
- He's an old man.

140
00:08:54,377 --> 00:09:00,132
You will find and be coupled off
with your soul mate

141
00:09:00,133 --> 00:09:03,253
and you will have to pass through
all the couple missions and final mission

142
00:09:03,254 --> 00:09:07,369
to escape off of this island, thus
becoming this race's winning couple.

143
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:09,513
- Only one couple?
- Yes, just one.

144
00:09:09,514 --> 00:09:13,193
- That's pretty cruel.
- We will now determine the couples.

145
00:09:13,194 --> 00:09:16,601
Let's take a brief moment to introduce
ourselves to all the men here.

146
00:09:16,602 --> 00:09:18,801
We don't have much time,
so we'll make our decisions quickly.

147
00:09:18,802 --> 00:09:21,397
We've actually all made
our selections already.

148
00:09:22,326 --> 00:09:24,842
- We're not going to change our minds.
- We can say the same about you.

149
00:09:24,843 --> 00:09:29,087
- I...
- You look like an awful jerk.

150
00:09:30,651 --> 00:09:33,553
- You look like a real awful jerk.
- Good eye!

151
00:09:33,554 --> 00:09:35,989
I'm a real awful bastard.

152
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:38,479
- Wow, he's so attractive!
- I actually find him attractive now.

153
00:09:38,957 --> 00:09:40,593
[Assumes the bad boy pose.]

154
00:09:40,594 --> 00:09:45,082
- Your upper teeth are so tiny!
- They're cute.

155
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:48,825
[Unique mini upper teeth are
found to be quite charming.]

156
00:09:48,826 --> 00:09:52,071
My looks are normal,
and my physique is normal too...

157
00:09:52,072 --> 00:09:54,066
He's telling us that he's normal.

158
00:09:54,067 --> 00:09:59,024
- He's a bluffer!
- His personality isn't what it seems.

159
00:10:00,018 --> 00:10:02,352
[This man... is very unique...]

160
00:10:02,956 --> 00:10:06,264
- I will do my best.
- That wasn't bad.

161
00:10:06,265 --> 00:10:09,102
- Can you treat us all to a meal?
- Excuse me?

162
00:10:09,103 --> 00:10:12,591
- Do you have any money?
- You're infamous for being very frugal.

163
00:10:12,592 --> 00:10:13,592
We heard that you're very
stingy with your money.

164
00:10:13,593 --> 00:10:16,212
Why are you suddenly asking
me about that?

165
00:10:16,213 --> 00:10:20,835
- A man should be more generous than that.
- Do you go dutch in Japan?

166
00:10:20,836 --> 00:10:23,549
- Do you go dutch even on dates?
- No, it's not like that...

167
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:25,896
But why are you suddenly
asking me all these questions?

168
00:10:25,897 --> 00:10:29,084
- Fine, I'm not eating!
- We can take care of ourselves!

169
00:10:29,945 --> 00:10:33,915
[You can just treat us next time.]

170
00:10:36,169 --> 00:10:39,312
[Thus starts the final survivors'
couple selection process.]

171
00:10:39,911 --> 00:10:41,725
One, two, three!

172
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,989
[Kwang Ja selects Jae Rim as her own.]

173
00:10:45,169 --> 00:10:47,943
[Couple Jae Rim and Kwang Ja.]

174
00:10:48,891 --> 00:10:53,136
[Min Gyo's cupid... is Hana.]

175
00:10:53,137 --> 00:10:55,977
[Couple Min Gyo and Hana.]

176
00:10:57,762 --> 00:11:00,357
[Dong Min's suspicious selection.]

177
00:11:00,358 --> 00:11:04,422
[Couple Dong Min and Ji Hyo.]

178
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:08,343
[These remaining members plays a round of
rock-paper-scissors to select their mates.]

179
00:11:08,344 --> 00:11:13,468
[Couple Soo Hong and Jong Sook.]

180
00:11:13,963 --> 00:11:16,423
[The remaining four members.]

181
00:11:16,424 --> 00:11:18,697
[Couple Big-nose and Jae Soon.]

182
00:11:19,193 --> 00:11:21,569
[Last but not least,
Couple Kang Nam and Gary.]

183
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:24,571
- Is everyone happy with their partners?
- Kang Nam's the girl here, right?

184
00:11:25,809 --> 00:11:29,599
- No, he's the man.
- We're going to switch on and off.

185
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,895
Depending on the mission.

186
00:11:31,896 --> 00:11:33,705
- Are you sure we're doing this right?
- Why?

187
00:11:33,706 --> 00:11:36,368
Aren't the couples supposed to
link arms together or things like that?

188
00:11:36,817 --> 00:11:39,131
Had I known this,
I wouldn't have chosen her.

189
00:11:41,427 --> 00:11:43,468
He picked her with an ulterior motive.

190
00:11:43,469 --> 00:11:45,509
I'm going to have to train her right.

191
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:47,605
[The six couples are now complete.]

192
00:11:59,834 --> 00:12:01,089
- Kwang Ja.
- Yes?

193
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:03,698
- Why are you standing apart from Jae Rim?
- No, I'm not.

194
00:12:03,699 --> 00:12:05,469
- Why are you doing that?
- No, we were just talking.

195
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:09,072
- We're getting to know each other.
- Come here, honey.

196
00:12:10,572 --> 00:12:13,836
[The manly man type.]

197
00:12:15,563 --> 00:12:18,467
- How old are you?
- I'm 30 years old.

198
00:12:18,468 --> 00:12:20,847
- We're the same age.
- You two are the same age.

199
00:12:20,848 --> 00:12:22,785
[Jae Rim and Kwang Ja are
a couple both born in '85.]

200
00:12:22,786 --> 00:12:26,385
- My honey friend.
- What's 'honey friend?'

201
00:12:26,386 --> 00:12:27,795
[Random Jae Rim comes up with
a very unique pet name.]

202
00:12:27,796 --> 00:12:31,827
- They're both the same age.
- I've never seen Kwang Soo so speechless.

203
00:12:31,828 --> 00:12:35,434
- Where did Soo Hong go?
- Why are you linking our fingers?

204
00:12:37,865 --> 00:12:41,974
My partner, Dong Min, is still
acting awkward around me.

205
00:12:42,984 --> 00:12:44,582
Why did you pick her if you
were going to act like that?

206
00:12:44,583 --> 00:12:47,120
- You're not acting like yourself!
- Look at that bashful smile.

207
00:12:47,121 --> 00:12:49,665
- Why are you acting like that?
- He's acting like that on purpose.

208
00:12:49,666 --> 00:12:51,683
Why is he acting like that?

209
00:12:51,684 --> 00:12:55,293
Towards the end of the show,
she's going to beg and plead for me.

210
00:12:56,592 --> 00:12:58,484
Let's go!

211
00:12:58,889 --> 00:13:02,838
[Off to the first mission location.]

212
00:13:02,839 --> 00:13:06,422
- What's all this about?
- What are they going to have us do?

213
00:13:06,423 --> 00:13:10,759
This is the rice paddy where the women
were trying to cultivate food for themselves.

214
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:13,607
- Yes, I remember this.
- We were just trying to eat and survive.

215
00:13:13,608 --> 00:13:15,784
Here's the first game
for Final Surviving Couple Race.

216
00:13:16,334 --> 00:13:21,417
We should test the endurance and
teamwork skills for each of the couples.

217
00:13:21,418 --> 00:13:23,364
Yes, that's very important for the men,
so we should test it.

218
00:13:23,365 --> 00:13:25,588
That's why we've prepared this game.

219
00:13:25,589 --> 00:13:28,175
This mission is called, 'The thread of fate.'

220
00:13:28,176 --> 00:13:30,737
- What's it about?
- Do we have to spin around?

221
00:13:30,738 --> 00:13:35,126
If you look over to the side, you'll see
the spools with the thread around it.

222
00:13:35,127 --> 00:13:37,572
- The women from each team...
- Yes?

223
00:13:37,573 --> 00:13:43,646
The women must get on the stand and stay
until the thread of fate finishes unraveling.

224
00:13:44,543 --> 00:13:49,578
The men will run over to their women
when they hear the blow of the whistle

225
00:13:49,613 --> 00:13:53,471
and run back towards the starting line with
the rope in hand until it unravels completely.

226
00:13:53,788 --> 00:14:01,179
The women will then alight from their stands
and grab the food dangling from the bar.

227
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:04,206
- That's going to be hard.
- The women will have to do it?

228
00:14:04,241 --> 00:14:06,775
- Why are you making the women do it?
- I really love that.

229
00:14:06,776 --> 00:14:09,875
- That's too hard for us women.
- Can we grab it with our hands?

230
00:14:09,876 --> 00:14:12,268
[Must jump and grab the food
with their hands.]

231
00:14:12,269 --> 00:14:13,977
- Will you be able to reach it?
- Okay.

232
00:14:15,685 --> 00:14:17,952
Honey, are you dissing me right now?

233
00:14:19,074 --> 00:14:22,118
Any height related game will be
disadvantageous for us.

234
00:14:22,119 --> 00:14:24,583
My sweetie can even get it
with his mouth.

235
00:14:24,584 --> 00:14:26,385
Can you make Kwang Ja jump
from his knees?

236
00:14:27,476 --> 00:14:30,181
Three rounds of the game will be played.

237
00:14:30,182 --> 00:14:34,280
The couple that wins the first round
wins first place.

238
00:14:34,281 --> 00:14:35,593
Really?

239
00:14:35,594 --> 00:14:38,085
The couple that wins the second round
will take second place.

240
00:14:38,086 --> 00:14:40,228
And the couple that wins the third round
will take third place.

241
00:14:40,229 --> 00:14:41,738
- That's why three rounds will be played.
- That's a great idea.

242
00:14:41,739 --> 00:14:43,651
We just need to win
one of the three rounds.

243
00:14:43,652 --> 00:14:46,108
- We're playing this three times?
- Yes, one of three rounds.

244
00:14:46,109 --> 00:14:47,332
We're going to play three times?

245
00:14:47,332 --> 00:14:49,871
He's still acting awkward!
What do I do?

246
00:14:49,873 --> 00:14:53,115
Hey, what's your deal?
Just act like yourself!

247
00:14:53,116 --> 00:14:55,237
[Instead of his usual grumpy expression,
it's an expression of nervous excitement.]

248
00:14:55,238 --> 00:14:56,862
He keeps acting really awkward
around me.

249
00:14:56,863 --> 00:15:00,236
Do you think we all came out here at
4am just so you can act like this?

250
00:15:01,349 --> 00:15:03,623
You've never been around a beautiful
woman like Ji Hyo before, have you?

251
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:07,340
You've never been around a beautiful
woman like Ji Hyo before, have you?

252
00:15:07,341 --> 00:15:10,163
She keeps wagging her tail at me.

253
00:15:10,883 --> 00:15:12,992
I can't even think clearly.

254
00:15:12,993 --> 00:15:15,597
I've been dealing with her
tail wagging for four years now.

255
00:15:16,506 --> 00:15:18,831
I've been dealing with that tail
for four years already.

256
00:15:18,832 --> 00:15:21,159
[Four years' worth of tail side effect.]

257
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,250
That was cute.

258
00:15:22,251 --> 00:15:26,033
The three winning couples will be given
a chance to pick something that will

259
00:15:26,034 --> 00:15:30,233
become extremely helpful at the final
mission of escaping off the island.

260
00:15:30,234 --> 00:15:33,370
Women, off to the spool,
and men, to the other side.

261
00:15:36,082 --> 00:15:39,739
[Just which couple will be the first
to unravel the thread of fate?]

262
00:15:40,762 --> 00:15:43,498
Min Gyo might even be able to
pull these up to his thighs.

263
00:15:44,502 --> 00:15:46,268
Hey, Min Gyo.

264
00:15:46,269 --> 00:15:49,727
- These are like pants on me.
- They are like pants on you.

265
00:15:49,728 --> 00:15:51,696
[The rain boots are practically
pants on Min Gyo's short legs.]

266
00:15:54,967 --> 00:15:57,160
I don't want you getting cold.

267
00:15:57,638 --> 00:16:00,168
Can you play some romantic
background music?

268
00:16:02,987 --> 00:16:05,222
Why is Dong Min acting like that?

269
00:16:05,223 --> 00:16:09,159
- What's he doing over there?
- He's being ridiculous.

270
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,676
Dong Min's been acting useless all day.

271
00:16:12,176 --> 00:16:16,358
[I don't care what anyone says,
because I'm happy right now.]

272
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:21,126
- You're just my style.
- We're just playing a game.

273
00:16:21,127 --> 00:16:23,307
So just don't hurt yourself, okay?

274
00:16:24,404 --> 00:16:27,087
Seriously!
When did you become so caring?

275
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:30,711
You like that?

276
00:16:31,419 --> 00:16:34,386
[Gae Eun explodes in a fit of jealousy.]

277
00:16:36,213 --> 00:16:39,856
[Thread of destiny- Round one.]

278
00:16:40,566 --> 00:16:43,994
Jong Sook!
It's me, your honey!

279
00:16:43,995 --> 00:16:46,031
- Honey!
- You trust me, don't you?

280
00:16:46,032 --> 00:16:48,038
- Of course, I trust you!
- I love you!

281
00:16:48,039 --> 00:16:52,235
Honey, if you don't do this right,
then you're dead!

282
00:16:53,576 --> 00:16:56,182
- What did you say? I love you, too!
- Okay!

283
00:16:56,183 --> 00:16:59,011
If you don't do this right,
then you're really dead.

284
00:16:59,537 --> 00:17:02,996
- What did he say? That he'll kill me?
- Yes, he'll kill you if you mess up.

285
00:17:02,997 --> 00:17:05,471
- He's going to kill me if I mess up?
- Jae Soon!

286
00:17:05,472 --> 00:17:09,269
- Your honey's coming for you!
- Honey, my butt!

287
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:11,917
- Hey!
- Mister, you'd better do it right!

288
00:17:11,918 --> 00:17:14,189
- I'm not a 'mister'.
- Phuket boy!

289
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:16,420
- I love you!
- Phuket boy, do it right!

290
00:17:16,421 --> 00:17:20,182
[It's not 'pocket boy', but 'Phuket boy.']

291
00:17:20,183 --> 00:17:22,736
['Honey' Big-nose and his love for Phuket.]

292
00:17:22,737 --> 00:17:26,111
- Honey, fighting!
- Ji Hyo!

293
00:17:27,385 --> 00:17:31,199
- What is he doing?
- What are you doing!

294
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,319
[Dong Min gets criticized
whenever he opens his mouth.]

295
00:17:34,682 --> 00:17:37,283
He acts like he really likes
Ji Hyo for real.

296
00:17:37,284 --> 00:17:41,453
Don't worry, it's okay if we lose.
Just don't hurt yourself, okay?

297
00:17:41,454 --> 00:17:45,922
- Thanks, honey!
- Knock it off, you two!

298
00:17:45,923 --> 00:17:48,076
Be quiet!

299
00:17:48,236 --> 00:17:50,468
[Lashes out at anyone who's
not his girl.]

300
00:17:50,469 --> 00:17:52,716
Pocket boy!

301
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:56,104
You're so cute!
You're cute, pocket boy!

302
00:17:56,105 --> 00:17:57,826
What happened?
Did his legs sink into the ground?

303
00:17:57,827 --> 00:17:59,548
Why happened to his legs?

304
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:04,914
- Why are you even saying that?
- My legs are sinking more than others.

305
00:18:05,733 --> 00:18:10,076
- Gae Eun!
- Honey, let's win this, and go to Gangnam!

306
00:18:10,077 --> 00:18:14,093
No matter how ugly you are,
I still love you!

307
00:18:14,094 --> 00:18:17,010
- I still love you!
- Thanks, honey!

his shouting love confession.]

309
00:18:21,005 --> 00:18:23,959
Okay!
Fighting!

310
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:26,742
[Time for random Jae Rim's
love confession.]

311
00:18:26,743 --> 00:18:28,927
Honey, calm yourself down first
before you say anything!

312
00:18:28,928 --> 00:18:33,590
No words are necessary!

313
00:18:33,591 --> 00:18:36,846
[Shoots Kwang Ja a heart.]

314
00:18:36,847 --> 00:18:39,593
- I'm coming for you!
- Honey, you're not weird!

315
00:18:39,594 --> 00:18:42,059
You're just a little different.

316
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:44,930
- Jae Rim.
- The winner of the first round...

317
00:18:44,931 --> 00:18:47,696
- Is the first place winner.
- Let's win this, Jae Soon!

00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:14,553
[Quickly acclimated to the muddy
field in just one round.]

489
00:31:15,795 --> 00:31:17,707
[Kang Nam, Min Gyo and Jae Rim-
First ones to arrive.]

490
00:31:17,708 --> 00:31:19,858
Can't you run any faster?

491
00:31:21,063 --> 00:31:24,185
[Even unravels the thread
at a faster speed.]

492
00:31:24,186 --> 00:31:25,922
- You can go slower.
- You're going too fast!

493
00:31:27,506 --> 00:31:30,821
[Dong Min's the only one taking his time.]

494
00:31:39,977 --> 00:31:42,503
[Kang Nam's monstrous screams.]

495
00:31:48,334 --> 00:31:52,159
[Gae Eun and Kang Nam are first
to finish unraveling the thread.]

496
00:31:56,928 --> 00:31:59,145
[Hana follows Gae Eun's lead.]

497
00:32:04,599 --> 00:32:06,843
Steven Segal!

498
00:32:06,844 --> 00:32:09,195
[Is Gae Eun Steven Segal's
doppelganger?]

499
00:32:09,196 --> 00:32:12,558
- He's right behind you.
- Steven Segal!

500
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:14,224
[Hana's dead run.]

501
00:32:17,985 --> 00:32:21,657
[The two shorties fight for it.]

502
00:32:21,658 --> 00:32:23,827
- Good job, Steven Segal!
- You have to jump for it.

503
00:32:23,828 --> 00:32:26,257
- Ji Hyo's coming!
- Stop her!

504
00:32:26,258 --> 00:32:27,913
[Ji Hyo and Kwang Ja join the group.]

505
00:32:28,936 --> 00:32:33,374
You have to watch out for Kwang Ja!

506
00:32:46,575 --> 00:32:48,979
[Kwang Ja succeeds!]

507
00:32:50,657 --> 00:32:54,444
[Kwang Ja and Jae Rim win
the third round!]

508
00:32:55,923 --> 00:32:58,183
That's too bad, Steven Segal.

509
00:32:58,184 --> 00:33:02,196
You were talking to me?
I'm Steven Segal?

510
00:33:03,495 --> 00:33:05,575
- You were talking to me?
- Here, you can eat it.

511
00:33:06,692 --> 00:33:09,953
[Kwang Ja and Jae Rim
win third place.]

512
00:33:11,669 --> 00:33:16,607
The winning couples will now come
forward in the order of their winning

513
00:33:16,608 --> 00:33:21,599
and choose one of the threads of fate
that are tied to the scarecrows' wrists

514
00:33:21,634 --> 00:33:25,820
and place your team's name card
in front of the dolls that you like.

515
00:33:25,821 --> 00:33:28,492
- These threads must mean something.
- This one is...

516
00:33:28,493 --> 00:33:30,277
Do we have to cut it off?

517
00:33:30,278 --> 00:33:32,272
[Six threads of fate that are
bound to the scarecrows' wrists...]

518
00:33:33,145 --> 00:33:36,154
[These threads' unexpected twist of fate!]

519
00:33:36,155 --> 00:33:38,801
[The sorrowful fate that
their decision will bring...]

520
00:33:38,802 --> 00:33:41,563
[What is the great hidden mystery
behind these threads?]

521
00:33:41,564 --> 00:33:44,674
Do you think they're going to tie
something to our wrists later on?

522
00:33:44,675 --> 00:33:48,243
- That's what I think, too.
- Do they always think out loud like this?

523
00:33:48,821 --> 00:33:51,043
They do think out loud,
but they're never right about it.

524
00:33:51,525 --> 00:33:54,457
- We're always wrong.
- They're just guessing.

525
00:33:54,458 --> 00:33:56,564
This may actually be for the better.

526
00:33:56,888 --> 00:34:03,044
[Just what is the meaning
of these scarecrows?]

527
00:34:03,045 --> 00:34:06,199
Let's just go with this one.
Don't you think elastic would be better?

528
00:34:06,548 --> 00:34:09,068
Why are you even asking when you're
just going to do as you want anyway?

529
00:34:09,069 --> 00:34:10,738
I didn't think you'd have an opinion.

530
00:34:10,738 --> 00:34:12,229
You're going to do what
you want anyway.

531
00:34:12,229 --> 00:34:13,450
[Jae Soon and Suk Jin - rubber.]

532
00:34:13,451 --> 00:34:15,838
Okay, the couple that
came in at second place.

533
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:19,498
- I don't know what this is about.
- My honey will decide.

534
00:34:19,892 --> 00:34:22,393
That's not what you call him
because you're not going to marry him.

535
00:34:22,394 --> 00:34:24,330
I can call him whatever
I want to call him.

536
00:34:24,331 --> 00:34:28,836
[I'm going to call my girl
whatever I want.]

537
00:34:28,837 --> 00:34:31,772
Why are you telling my man what to do?
Honey, which one would you like?

538
00:34:31,773 --> 00:34:33,696
- Which one should we choose?
- Choose whichever one you'd like.

539
00:34:33,697 --> 00:34:37,263
- But tell me what you're thinking.
- If you and I were to get tied up together...

540
00:34:37,264 --> 00:34:39,874
- I think the metal would be the best.
- Don't you think that'd be too heavy?

541
00:34:40,182 --> 00:34:41,843
You're probably right.

542
00:34:41,844 --> 00:34:44,540
[Soo Hong immediately changes his mind
and agrees with Jong Sook.]

543
00:34:44,541 --> 00:34:48,450
- What do you think about that one?
- I think that will be perfect.

544
00:34:48,451 --> 00:34:53,548
- But why are there two similar ones?
- Just make up your mind!

545
00:34:53,921 --> 00:34:57,334
Hurry up!
I'm so sick and tired of this!

546
00:34:57,335 --> 00:34:59,584
- We'll take that one.
- Okay.

547
00:34:59,585 --> 00:35:02,410
[Jong Sook and Soo Hong
select the hiking rope.]

548
00:35:02,411 --> 00:35:04,296
- Okay, third place.
- Third place winners.

549
00:35:04,297 --> 00:35:06,249
[Kwang Ja and Jae Rim's
turn to choose.]

550
00:35:06,588 --> 00:35:08,552
I want my male honey to choose
whichever one you'd like.

551
00:35:08,553 --> 00:35:11,097
What?
Male honey?

552
00:35:11,098 --> 00:35:12,808
Do you want a beating?

553
00:35:17,057 --> 00:35:20,018
I think I like this one.
Let's go with this one.

554
00:35:20,019 --> 00:35:25,163
[Jae Rim selects the laundry rope
without consulting his partner.]

555
00:35:25,164 --> 00:35:27,689
- That's going to snap right away.
- You can trust me on this one.

556
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:32,259
[The remaining couples can select
from the rest on their own.]

557
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:36,432
We don't know what this even means,
so this will either be the best or the worst.

558
00:35:36,433 --> 00:35:38,521
Okay, then let's go with this one.
We're selecting this one.

559
00:35:38,522 --> 00:35:41,494
- Let's go with this one.
- Okay.

560
00:35:41,495 --> 00:35:43,880
[Gae Eun and Kang Nam select
the polypropylene rope.]

561
00:35:43,881 --> 00:35:47,472
[Hana and Min Gyo select
the plastic string.]

562
00:35:56,774 --> 00:35:59,105
- Where were you?
- Sorry, partner.

563
00:35:59,106 --> 00:36:01,482
I had to go to the bathroom.

564
00:36:02,937 --> 00:36:04,579
[Kindly attaches her name tag
onto her back.]

565
00:36:05,825 --> 00:36:07,819
[With their hands tightly held...]

566
00:36:10,739 --> 00:36:14,791
[Being together with Ji Hyo today...
is heaven.]

567
00:36:14,792 --> 00:36:17,552
- What's wrong with him?
- Are you serious?

568
00:36:17,553 --> 00:36:20,001
- Seriously, Dong Min.
- He's smiling from ear to ear.

569
00:36:20,002 --> 00:36:25,568
- Are you in love with her?
- I've never seen him smiling like that.

570
00:36:26,733 --> 00:36:29,381
[Together with their partners
on this crisp fall day...]

571
00:36:29,382 --> 00:36:31,130
- He's too big for me.
- Who is?

572
00:36:31,131 --> 00:36:33,967
[Jong Sook and her big muscles...]

573
00:36:33,968 --> 00:36:37,402
The best spot to hold him by
is around his ribcage.

574
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:41,780
- His ribcage?
- His muscles provide a handle.

575
00:36:41,781 --> 00:36:43,654
[My girl's unique
latissimus dorsi handle.]

576
00:36:43,655 --> 00:36:47,643
I can hear your joints cracking
every time you swing your arms.

577
00:36:48,727 --> 00:36:51,937
Is something wrong with your arms?
Do you hear the cracking too?

578
00:36:51,938 --> 00:36:53,723
Yes, I feel it too.
I wonder what's wrong with it.

579
00:36:53,724 --> 00:36:58,145
[The final 12 survivors-
Where are they being taken to?]

580
00:36:59,312 --> 00:37:02,533
Your joints sound like old creaking doors.

581
00:37:06,244 --> 00:37:09,259
Isn't this a huge bird cage?

582
00:37:10,693 --> 00:37:15,845
This is to test the men's chivalry
and the women's loyalty.

583
00:37:15,846 --> 00:37:18,056
This mission is
'Princess name tag elimination'.

584
00:37:18,821 --> 00:37:22,597
Princess name tag elimination?
This is Kim Jong Kook's game!

585
00:37:22,598 --> 00:37:26,343
- How is this my game?
- You're saying that it's not?

586
00:37:26,344 --> 00:37:31,414
Two couples at a time will go into this
birdcage and play name tag elimination.

587
00:37:32,549 --> 00:37:34,627
It's great weather for some
name tag elimination.

588
00:37:34,628 --> 00:37:37,120
- For yours to be eliminated, maybe.
- Maybe you're right.

589
00:37:37,438 --> 00:37:39,389
[Let's do our best, Jae Rim.]

590
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:41,950
It doesn't matter if the men's
name tag gets eliminated.

591
00:37:41,951 --> 00:37:45,251
The woman's name tag must get
eliminated in order to win.

592
00:37:45,252 --> 00:37:46,991
[Must eliminate the woman's name tag
in order to win the mission.]

593
00:37:46,992 --> 00:37:49,347
What if I were to rip off
the woman's nose?

594
00:37:49,348 --> 00:37:51,752
Why would you rip off their nose?

595
00:37:51,753 --> 00:37:53,138
[This is the Dong Min
they're more used to.]

596
00:37:53,139 --> 00:37:55,905
And food will be the prize to win
at each mission.

597
00:37:55,906 --> 00:38:02,082
The winning couple will take the food
they won and move onto the next round.

598
00:38:02,083 --> 00:38:04,331
Which means the amount of food
will keep adding up.

599
00:38:04,332 --> 00:38:09,894
All the food will then be on the line for
the final round of name tag elimination.

600
00:38:09,895 --> 00:38:13,584
[The final winning couple
will win all the food supplies.]

601
00:38:13,585 --> 00:38:16,092
- No wonder you haven't fed us yet.
- That isn't all either.

602
00:38:16,093 --> 00:38:18,107
Remember the rope that you
all had to choose?

603
00:38:18,108 --> 00:38:21,393
The winning couple will also be given
the chance to swap it out

604
00:38:21,394 --> 00:38:23,489
so the winning couple can earn all
the ropes and food supplies as well.

605
00:38:23,490 --> 00:38:27,004
You'll see a diagram behind you,
and the final two slots in the end.

606
00:38:27,005 --> 00:38:29,078
The two couples to land in those slots will
move on immediately to the final round.

607
00:38:29,079 --> 00:38:33,040
You can decide amongst yourselves which two
couples will end up there on your own.

608
00:38:33,682 --> 00:38:36,221
Then how about we keep it
simple like this?

609
00:38:36,222 --> 00:38:40,261
The men can grab tightly onto
each other's hands like this

610
00:38:40,262 --> 00:38:43,185
and the ones to scream out in pain first
will be the first to get eliminated.

611
00:38:43,186 --> 00:38:45,122
- Sure, let's do that.
- How does that sound?

612
00:38:45,123 --> 00:38:47,391
- Is that okay with everyone?
- Just between men?

613
00:38:47,392 --> 00:38:51,225
- Get ready!
- First person to lose goes over there?

614
00:38:51,226 --> 00:38:54,547
Kang Nam, you have to
win this no matter what.

615
00:38:54,548 --> 00:38:57,354
- Get ready.
- Dong Jin, fighting!

616
00:38:57,799 --> 00:39:00,701
- Ready!
- Is everyone ready?

617
00:39:00,702 --> 00:39:02,595
I'm going to endure it even if
this game shatters my hand!

618
00:39:03,929 --> 00:39:09,661
[Game to move onto the final round-
Don't scream out in pain!]

619
00:39:12,974 --> 00:39:15,289
[Wicked Jang grits down on his teeth.]

620
00:39:15,290 --> 00:39:17,968
- You have to endure the pain!
- I like that expression on your face.

621
00:39:17,969 --> 00:39:20,959
- You look really cute.
- Endure it!

622
00:39:22,219 --> 00:39:24,923
You look really cute right now.

623
00:39:24,924 --> 00:39:27,529
[I shall endure through this pain.]

624
00:39:29,775 --> 00:39:32,201
Even talking will get you eliminated.

625
00:39:32,202 --> 00:39:34,425
- Endure it!
- Squeeze harder!

626
00:39:34,426 --> 00:39:38,233
- Endure it!
- You can do it!

627
00:39:38,234 --> 00:39:42,102
- Min Gyo's almost there.
- We can't be eliminated already!

628
00:39:42,103 --> 00:39:46,401
- Squeeze harder!
- I can see Suk Jin's almost there!

629
00:39:46,402 --> 00:39:49,367
- I can see Suk Jin's almost there.
- You almost have him.

630
00:39:51,803 --> 00:39:54,297
[Jae Soon and Suk Jin are eliminated.]

631
00:39:54,298 --> 00:39:56,231
[I eliminated him.]

632
00:39:56,232 --> 00:39:59,241
You can take a quick break.
Let go and take a quick break.

633
00:39:59,785 --> 00:40:01,761
[Jong Sook, that hurts so bad...]

634
00:40:03,435 --> 00:40:04,915
[Strength of Ji Hyo keeps me strong.]

635
00:40:05,901 --> 00:40:08,130
[I will endure through
this pain for Gae Eun.]

636
00:40:08,131 --> 00:40:10,262
Endure through it just a bit longer.
You're almost done.

637
00:40:11,149 --> 00:40:13,777
Look at how nice my veins are.

638
00:40:13,778 --> 00:40:16,336
[This man is bragging about how
good his veins are looking.]

639
00:40:16,337 --> 00:40:20,717
This time, you'll grab and tug on
each other's sideburn hair.

640
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:24,800
- Hey, you can't do that.
- You have to endure the pain.

641
00:40:25,498 --> 00:40:28,254
- Wow, he's really evil.
- Get ready.

642
00:40:28,838 --> 00:40:32,676
I'm sorry to ask this, but what if I pull
too hard and rip off their skin?

643
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:37,067
There's no need to pull that hard.

644
00:40:37,068 --> 00:40:38,946
You just have to win this round.

645
00:40:38,947 --> 00:40:42,246
[With their pride on the line,
they'll sacrifice their sideburns.]

646
00:40:42,247 --> 00:40:43,458
[This is for my woman...]

647

[Even with Soo Hong's elimination,
the battle still continues on.]

651
00:41:04,141 --> 00:41:06,766
You can't pull it out like that.
No, wait!

652
00:41:10,304 --> 00:41:12,978
Why are you doing this to me!

653
00:41:13,845 --> 00:41:16,563
[Ji Hyo, I endured through
the pain for your love.]

654

Kang Nam is eliminated.

655
00:41:18,582 --> 00:41:21,317
- No, this isn't right!
- No, you're eliminated.

656
00:41:21,318 --> 00:41:24,983
- This isn't even a show!
- Wait, I think you're missing hair.

657
00:41:24,984 --> 00:41:28,508
- Why do you shave your sideburns?
- You're already eliminated.

658
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:31,828
You're the one who
suggested this game, right?

659
00:41:31,829 --> 00:41:34,090
Come here.
Do you know how badly that hurts?

660
00:41:34,396 --> 00:41:37,843
[I can endure this sort of agony...]

661
00:41:37,844 --> 00:41:40,840
[I'm a man who isn't afraid of
self-sacrifice for my woman!]

662
00:41:41,104 --> 00:41:44,127
- You're doing great, honey!
- This time, it'll be a tickle game.

663
00:41:44,473 --> 00:41:46,369
You can do this.

664
00:41:46,370 --> 00:41:48,502
How about we throw this in
the air and head butt it?

665
00:41:51,182 --> 00:41:54,275
Okay, next will be a tickling game.

666
00:41:54,626 --> 00:41:58,016
[Jong Sook will demonstrate how
to tickle the right way.]

667
00:41:59,935 --> 00:42:02,256
[Jae Soon doesn't even last a second.]

668
00:42:02,257 --> 00:42:06,011
- Soo Hong, you give it a try.
- I'm not ticklish in the least.

669
00:42:06,012 --> 00:42:08,216
I'm seriously not ticklish.
Not at all.

670
00:42:08,217 --> 00:42:10,112
It's a different sort of ticklish.

671
00:42:20,136 --> 00:42:22,664
[I never want to do that again.]

672
00:42:22,665 --> 00:42:26,404
He was literally convulsing.

673
00:42:31,037 --> 00:42:33,538
It's a new dance!

674
00:42:33,539 --> 00:42:34,954

[Round three- Tickling game.
First contestant- Min Gyo.]

677
00:42:42,475 --> 00:42:44,946
Wait, what is it?

678
00:42:44,947 --> 00:42:46,786
[Starts giggling at the slightest touch.]

679
00:42:46,787 --> 00:42:51,464
I don't know if it's because of the show
he does, but he looks so natural at this.

680
00:42:52,478 --> 00:42:55,450
Min Gyo, can you do that thing you do?

681
00:42:58,334 --> 00:43:01,148
[Our Min Gyo is so cute.]

682
00:43:01,149 --> 00:43:03,228

made in heaven.]

[His eyes are about to
pop out of his head.]

687
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:17,698
- You're doing great.
- You're enduring it pretty well.

688
00:43:17,699 --> 00:43:19,176
[He's slowly getting there.]

689
00:43:21,601 --> 00:43:23,396
- How many seconds?
- 11 seconds.

690
00:43:23,397 --> 00:43:25,442

00:43:50,843 --> 00:43:53,564
- Dong Min, just laugh.
- Are they wrestling?

697
00:43:53,565 --> 00:43:55,462
[It's okay to laugh, Dong Min.]

698
00:43:55,463 --> 00:43:58,136
Just laugh!

699
00:43:58,137 --> 00:44:00,984
[Grumpy Jang endures through the tickling...]

705
00:44:18,081 --> 00:44:22,002
- Honey, you have to endure through it!

[Right before the start of the
princess name tag elimination game.]

718

I have to keep my hands moist
to help with the name tag ripping.

719
00:45:10,142 --> 00:45:13,116
- You have to keep your hands moist.
- That's not true.

720

[Jong Sook and Soo Hong busy
themselves with their hand cream.]

721

by applying hand cream.

722
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:22,457
The first food item in the
princess name tag elimination is...

723
00:45:22,458 --> 00:45:24,656
- I will now reveal the food item.
- Okay.

724
00:45:30,149 --> 00:45:33,477
- That would be do good right now.
- It's perfect to eat on an empty stomach.

most comfortable lying down at?

730

You just worry about yourself.
But I'd prefer being in the sun.

731

around like this together, Jae Soon.

760
00:47:39,605 --> 00:47:41,617

Are there any games where we
have to crawl into small spaces?

so much hand lotion?

- Wow, he has really long arms.
- Yes, he has really long arms.

809
00:50:26,618 --> 00:50:28,776
[I'm going to get all of you!]

810
00:50:34,326 --> 00:50:37,361
[Wait, that's his teammate,
Kang Nam's name tag?]

811
00:50:39,673 --> 00:50:43,243
[Ousts his own team member.]

812
00:50:44,641 --> 00:50:48,257
[Gae Eun eliminates his own teammate,
Kang Nam's name tag!]

813
00:50:48,877 --> 00:50:50,737
[Completely befuddled.]

814
00:50:50,738 --> 00:50:52,647
What are you doing!

815
00:50:52,648 --> 00:50:54,821
[Thank you, Gae Eun.]

816
00:50:54,822 --> 00:50:57,687
Why would you eliminate my name tag!

817
00:50:57,688 --> 00:51:00,585
I was just trying to help...

818
00:51:00,586 --> 00:51:04,145
[First time ever on RM that someone
eliminates his own partner's name tag.]

819
00:51:04,927 --> 00:51:07,587
[Thanks to that,
our workload is lessened.]

820
00:51:07,588 --> 00:51:10,544
- A lover's quarrel!
- Let us do that again.

821
00:51:11,928 --> 00:51:14,992
[It's a cutthroat game,
and water under the bridge.]

822
00:51:15,982 --> 00:51:19,605
[Gae Eun's teammate, Kang Nam is out.]

823
00:51:19,606 --> 00:51:21,926
- This isn't even right!
- Gary was really fast.

824
00:51:22,948 --> 00:51:26,898
[Current score-
Jong Sook, Soo Hong:1 vs Gae Eun:1.]

825
00:51:26,899 --> 00:51:29,124
- You can't do that.
- This isn't right.

826
00:51:29,125 --> 00:51:31,072
Gae Eun!

827
00:51:33,056 --> 00:51:36,590
- Gae Eun!
- Wait! My arm!

828
00:51:37,721 --> 00:51:41,078
[A very sad ending-
His shirt gets stretched out to no end.]

829
00:51:46,829 --> 00:51:51,026
[Ugh... my frustrating Gae Eun...]

830
00:51:54,620 --> 00:51:57,424
I can't believe Gae Eun
eliminated his own partner.

831
00:52:00,087 --> 00:52:01,729
What were you thinking, Gae Eun?

832
00:52:08,380 --> 00:52:11,287
[Finals- Ji Hyo, Dong Min
vs Jong Sook, Soo Hong.]

833
00:52:11,288 --> 00:52:15,435
This is the final round and all the food
that's been earned so far is in that basket.

834
00:52:15,436 --> 00:52:19,453
The winner takes all the food as well as
the chance to swap out their ropes.

835
00:52:19,454 --> 00:52:20,669
[The winner has the chance at a swap.]

836
00:52:20,670 --> 00:52:23,248
You're mine, Grumpy.

837
00:52:23,249 --> 00:52:25,933
[Grumpy Jang,
I've been waiting for this moment.]

838
00:52:25,934 --> 00:52:28,760
[Muscle Jong Sook, I'm the new name in town
when it comes to name tag elimination.]

839
00:52:28,761 --> 00:52:31,777
[Highly charged battlefield.]

840
00:52:31,778 --> 00:52:33,775
- I wonder what'll happen.
- Ji Hyo shouldn't be taken lightly.

841
00:52:35,183 --> 00:52:37,139
I'll grab Dong Min.

842
00:52:37,140 --> 00:52:39,451
[Jong Sook and Soo Hong's plan-
Jong Sook vs Dong Min.]

843
00:52:39,452 --> 00:52:42,703
[With Soo Hong vs. Ji Hyo.]

844
00:52:42,704 --> 00:52:44,479
No need to tiptoe around Ji Hyo.

845
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:46,147
[I will protect Ji Hyo.]

846
00:52:46,148 --> 00:52:49,876
- Why are you trying to act cool?
- Stay back! I'll take care of this.

847
00:52:49,877 --> 00:52:53,075
- Stop that! It doesn't suit you.
- Just stay behind me!

848
00:52:53,076 --> 00:52:54,763
[Ji Hyo's own personal bodyguard.]

849
00:52:56,443 --> 00:52:59,705
- Hey, you're known for being grumpy!
- This is nothing like you!

850
00:52:59,706 --> 00:53:01,633
[Grumpy Jang, shall we do this?]

851
00:53:02,697 --> 00:53:05,025
[Jong Sook starts approaching closer.]

852
00:53:05,026 --> 00:53:06,687
Where do you think you're grabbing!

853
00:53:07,407 --> 00:53:09,558
I don't know what to do.
I'm so sorry.

854
00:53:11,877 --> 00:53:14,955
[Eliminates each other's name tag
simultaneously?]

855
00:53:14,956 --> 00:53:17,480
[While Soo Hong was taking
his sweet time...]

856
00:53:17,481 --> 00:53:20,183
[Ji Hyo eliminates his name tag first!]

857
00:53:22,208 --> 00:53:24,575
[Soo Hong, out!]

858
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:28,552
[Ji Hyo and Dong Min vs Jong Sook-
It's two against one!]

859
00:53:30,317 --> 00:53:34,370
[If we combine our strength,
then we just may beat Jong Sook!]

860
00:53:34,371 --> 00:53:40,694
[Jong Sook vs Dong Min and Ji Hyo-
The pivotal moment!]

861
00:53:44,583 --> 00:53:48,208
[By the split of a hair, Jong Sook
eliminates Ji Hyo's name tag first!]

862
00:53:48,676 --> 00:53:50,598
[That's our Mr. Capable!]

863
00:53:50,599 --> 00:53:52,255
- It's only Dong Min now?
- Did you see how he ripped it off?

864
00:53:52,256 --> 00:53:54,104
Honey, just kill him.

865
00:53:55,170 --> 00:54:00,920
[The only two left now are...
Muscle Jong Sook and Grumpy Jang.]

866
00:54:00,921 --> 00:54:04,698
[The last two survivors final showdown.]

867
00:54:04,699 --> 00:54:08,364

- Come here.

868
00:54:08,399 --> 00:54:11,016
- Come here.
- You can do this!

869
00:54:11,017 --> 00:54:14,300
[A fierce battle of strength.]

870
00:54:14,301 --> 00:54:17,388
Teach him a stiff lesson!

871
00:54:21,571 --> 00:54:24,322
- I feel so bad for him!
- The poor thing!

872
00:54:25,528 --> 00:54:28,270
[Grumpy Jang is rendered helpless.]

873
00:54:28,271 --> 00:54:30,154
[Stay strong, Dong Min.]

874
00:54:31,566 --> 00:54:34,545
[Will this be the end for Grumpy Jang?]

875
00:54:34,546 --> 00:54:36,733
Jong Sook, just finish him already!

876
00:54:36,734 --> 00:54:39,673
- I'm going get you!
- Just finish him, Jong Sook.

877
00:54:39,674 --> 00:54:41,747
[What...]

878
00:54:41,821 --> 00:54:43,902
I'm going to rip it off!

879
00:54:43,903 --> 00:54:46,327
How dare you put your hands on that!

880
00:54:47,058 --> 00:54:48,822
[Immediately flustered.]

881
00:54:49,481 --> 00:54:52,663

- You're finally being yourself.

882
00:54:52,664 --> 00:54:54,430
[Grumpy Jang finally shows
his wretched personality?]

883
00:54:56,338 --> 00:54:58,532
- My chest...
- What about your chest?

884
00:54:58,533 --> 00:55:01,510
- What about your chest?
- I don't think I can breathe.

885
00:55:01,511 --> 00:55:03,734
He says he can't breathe.

886
00:55:05,126 --> 00:55:08,425
Dong Min!
Just let him rip it off!

887
00:55:09,756 --> 00:55:12,087
- I said, I can't breathe.
- Why can't you breathe?

888
00:55:12,088 --> 00:55:14,620
I said, I can't breathe!

889
00:55:16,666 --> 00:55:18,664

[The biggest challenge Mr. Capable
has ever had to face?]

That's the Dong Min I know.

892
00:55:25,667 --> 00:55:29,269
- Playing dirty is just your style.
- You're the filthiest player ever.

893
00:55:37,360 --> 00:55:42,051

[King of dirty tricks, Grumpy Jang.]

900
00:56:08,401 --> 00:56:11,193
I've never seen such dirty plays in
all fours years of doing Running Man.

901
00:56:11,194 --> 00:56:14,641
This was my favorite part.
'Ugh, I can't breathe...'

902
00:56:14,642 --> 00:56:19,288
[After the show of inability to breathe...
lunges out in fit of rage.]

907
00:56:30,357 --> 00:56:33,141
I know everyone's hungry, but
we're going to eat this by ourselves.

908
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:35,925

and stop getting involved!

[4D Jae Rim is totally whipped
by Kwang Ja.]

921

the chance to swap out their rope.

972
01:00:46,268 --> 01:00:48,617
I think it'll be good
to have something stretchy.

973
01:00:48,618 --> 01:00:51,914
Let's go for the rubber rope.
We're going to swap it out for this.

974
01:00:52,340 --> 01:00:54,323
See?
They swapped it out for ours.

975
01:00:54,324 --> 01:00:56,600
I think the rubber one
is going to be advantageous.

976
01:00:57,026 --> 01:00:59,478
I'm going to follow her wishes.

977
01:00:59,479 --> 01:01:02,834
- They act like they're getting married.
- We'll take this one.

978
01:01:04,144 --> 01:01:07,031
[Swaps it out for Gae Eun and
Kang Nam's recently swapped rubber rope.]

979
01:01:07,032 --> 01:01:09,171
Why did it have to be
the metal chain of all things?

980
01:01:09,172 --> 01:01:11,171
I'm sorry, Gary.

981
01:01:12,153 --> 01:01:17,526
- Let's trade it out for Hana's?
- We're so hungry.

982
01:01:17,527 --> 01:01:20,101
Let's swap Hana and Min Gyo's with
Jae Soon and Suk Jin's.

983
01:01:20,102 --> 01:01:22,068
[Hana and Min Gyo's plastic tie
with Jae Soon and Suk Jin's hiking rope.]

984
01:01:22,069 --> 01:01:24,235
[I can't stand to see Jae Soon doing well.]

985
01:01:24,236 --> 01:01:28,214
- You're such a dirty player.
- Why would you swap ours out?

986
01:01:28,215 --> 01:01:30,443
You seriously are such a dirty player.

987
01:01:30,444 --> 01:01:33,576
[First round selection]

988
01:01:33,577 --> 01:01:35,980
[Second round selection]

989
01:01:35,981 --> 01:01:40,039
[Just what is the purpose of these ropes?]

990
01:01:42,220 --> 01:01:45,030
[Time to eat the cup ramen we just won.]

991
01:01:45,031 --> 01:01:47,364
Are you seriously going to eat
that by yourself in front of all of us?

992
01:01:47,365 --> 01:01:51,605
Why would I eat this?
I'll give it to the hard worker.

993
01:01:51,606 --> 01:01:53,703
- He doesn't eat ramen.
- Seriously?

994
01:01:55,390 --> 01:01:58,012
[But eats the egg in one bite.]

995
01:01:58,013 --> 01:02:00,914
Can I get one of those eggs in here?

996
01:02:02,695 --> 01:02:04,635
Never mind, I'll just eat it like this.

997
01:02:04,636 --> 01:02:08,083
- I'm not a huge fan of eggs anyway.
- Here, you can eat this.

998
01:02:09,011 --> 01:02:10,757
That looks so good.

999
01:02:10,758 --> 01:02:14,267
- Wow, that's the best.
- That looks so awesome.

1000
01:02:14,268 --> 01:02:17,740
- Why would you get that on film?
- It's like my own cooking show.

1001
01:02:19,744 --> 01:02:22,710
[Park Soo Hong's cooking Korea-
Final 12 survivor's essential ramen.]

1002
01:02:24,269 --> 01:02:26,503
- Want some coffee in there?
- Wow, that looks so good.

1003
01:02:26,504 --> 01:02:28,471
- Wow, that looks so good.
- How am I going to eat all this?

1004
01:02:28,472 --> 01:02:30,049
I can't stand to watch it!

1005
01:02:30,979 --> 01:02:32,891
Watching him eat is like torture.

1006
01:02:32,892 --> 01:02:35,688
Is it good?
Does it taste good?

1007
01:02:37,519 --> 01:02:40,020
- Aren't you going to have any kimchi?
- I'm so hungry right now.

1008
01:02:40,021 --> 01:02:42,319
If you're not eating the kimchi,
then can we have it?

1009
01:02:42,996 --> 01:02:45,494
[Yeah... this is the stuff.]

1010
01:02:45,495 --> 01:02:47,816
[A bite of kimchi, too.]

1011
01:02:48,603 --> 01:02:50,593
[Eyes are transfixed.]

1012
01:02:52,222 --> 01:02:55,076
- Let's play for a sip of the broth.
- Okay, let's do it.

1013
01:02:55,836 --> 01:03:01,242
[One sip of the broth,
and a hardboiled egg.]

1014
01:03:01,243 --> 01:03:03,784
Rock, paper, scissors.

1015
01:03:04,333 --> 01:03:06,523
[Hana and Min Gyo win.]

1016
01:03:07,125 --> 01:03:10,180
[This is the best.]

1017
01:03:10,713 --> 01:03:15,430
- I really want some ramen.
- It's a perfect meal on a morning like this.

1018
01:03:15,431 --> 01:03:17,583
With this crisp weather...

1019
01:03:20,921 --> 01:03:23,544
- I can't stand this.
- I can't stand watching them eat.

1020
01:03:23,545 --> 01:03:27,305
[A strand of noodle in his mouth!]

1021

[Final 12 survivors-
Survival mission three.]

1023
01:03:43,596 --> 01:03:45,054
What's this?

1024

[What is the next survival mission
that awaits these members?]

1025
01:03:49,402 --> 01:03:52,163
- Thank you all for coming.
- Sure.

1026
01:03:52,641 --> 01:03:56,123
It's the group tug of war.

1027

[Survival mission three-
Group tug of war.]

1028
01:04:01,456 --> 01:04:03,577
It's another strength based mission!

1029
01:04:04,236 --> 01:04:07,219
- Don't you have any luck based missions?
- Don't you think you're being too harsh?

1030
01:04:07,220 --> 01:04:10,358
- This is unfair.
- The world is about to end.

1031
01:04:10,359 --> 01:04:12,498
So it's all about
survival of the fittest.

1032
01:04:12,499 --> 01:04:14,637
It all comes down to strength.

1033
01:04:14,638 --> 01:04:17,399
- Don't you agree?
- What are you even saying?

1034
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:20,475
I want all the writers on the ground
for a little beating.

[Grumpy Jang is back!]

1036
01:04:27,572 --> 01:04:30,101
He definitely is a grump.

1037
01:04:30,102 --> 01:04:33,879
The men will tie a rope around
their waists

1038
01:04:33,914 --> 01:04:40,139
and relay the item given to their female
partners before the opposing couples.

1039
01:04:40,705 --> 01:04:43,504
Do the women have to just stand still?
Then Jong Kook won't participate?

1040
01:04:43,505 --> 01:04:47,529
The partners receiving the items
will stand behind the table.

With the items given,
the partners will have to build a pile.

1042

stand with their arms in the air to win.

1043

01:11:12,367 --> 01:11:14,798
[Retracts on their promise and
attempts to relay the fifth one.]

1135
01:11:14,799 --> 01:11:16,350
Come here!

1136
01:11:18,205 --> 01:11:21,356
What are you guys doing!

1137
01:11:23,491 --> 01:11:30,485
[Taking advantage of Kwang Ja and
Jae Soon, Jong Sook forges ahead.]

1138
01:11:30,486 --> 01:11:32,179
Now's your chance!

1139
01:11:36,366 --> 01:11:39,175
[Everyone topples to the ground
from Jong Sook's single pull.]

1140
01:11:40,551 --> 01:11:42,455
One at a time.
There you go, you got it!

1141
01:11:42,456 --> 01:11:46,709
There you go, you got it!
You're like a Hercules... girl.

1142
01:11:46,710 --> 01:11:48,062
Hurry!

1143
01:11:48,063 --> 01:11:52,520
[Hercules girl?]

1144
01:11:52,521 --> 01:11:54,492
[Makes his delivery all at once!]

1145
01:11:54,493 --> 01:11:56,594
Now's your chance!

1146
01:11:56,595 --> 01:12:00,836
[Thanks to Jong Sook's pull,
Dong Min's also able to hand his over.]

1147
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:06,328
Give it to me now.

1148
01:12:06,329 --> 01:12:12,180
[Gae Eun escapes the partnership and
successfully hands all five over.]

1149
01:12:15,108 --> 01:12:17,279
[Meanwhile...]

1150
01:12:17,280 --> 01:12:20,513
[Jae Soon and Kwang Ja are still
duking it out.]

1151
01:12:22,556 --> 01:12:24,494
You guys have to work together!

1152
01:12:24,495 --> 01:12:26,664
[Finally manages to get up...]

1153
01:12:27,305 --> 01:12:29,456
[This way!]

1154
01:12:32,650 --> 01:12:34,668
[Kwang Ja finally hands his first one over.]

1155
01:12:38,285 --> 01:12:39,793
One more!

1156
01:12:39,794 --> 01:12:42,150
- Just give him one!
- You've got it!

1157
01:12:43,732 --> 01:12:47,704
[The team to get all five tiers first and
last for three seconds wins the mission.]

1158
01:12:50,442 --> 01:12:52,171
How am I going to stack these?

1159
01:12:52,172 --> 01:12:55,580
[Yogurt pile isn't as easy as it looks.]

1160
01:12:57,362 --> 01:13:01,470
[Soo Hong, Kang Nam and
Ji Hyo's race to the finish line.]

1161
01:13:01,471 --> 01:13:03,448
They already have their five!

1162
01:13:03,449 --> 01:13:05,030
Bring me my last one!

1163
01:13:05,031 --> 01:13:07,078
[Jae Soon and Suk Jin just
need one more...]

1164
01:13:08,404 --> 01:13:10,033
[Successfully hands in his last one.]

1165
01:13:12,877 --> 01:13:16,174
- Hey! Why are you shaking it?
- Just flip the table over!

1166
01:13:18,066 --> 01:13:21,093
- Just flip it over.
- Can you hand me my yogurt?

1167
01:13:21,094 --> 01:13:23,480
- Hand me my yogurt!
- Hurry up.

1168
01:13:24,059 --> 01:13:26,538
[Just then, Blank Ji completes her pile!]

1169
01:13:27,822 --> 01:13:30,892
[But it doesn't last the three seconds.]

1170
01:13:32,825 --> 01:13:37,064
[With the different top and bottom ratio,
it's hard to find the balance.]

1171
01:13:46,284 --> 01:13:50,412
[Just who will be the first?]

1172
01:13:50,413 --> 01:13:51,758
Just hurry.

1173
01:13:52,876 --> 01:13:57,377
[Suk Jin flips every other one over to
match the size of the base!]

1174
01:13:59,048 --> 01:14:02,565
[Who will be the first to successfully
build the five tiered pile?]

1175
01:14:03,699 --> 01:14:09,351
[Chance to swap out the rope
is balanced on the line!]

1176
01:14:10,364 --> 01:14:12,908
[Big-nose finishes building his pile first.]

1177
01:14:14,342 --> 01:14:16,805
[Must last for three seconds.]

1178
01:14:18,780 --> 01:14:21,850
[Jae Soon and Suk Jin win!]

1179
01:14:22,561 --> 01:14:25,931
[So close...]

1180
01:14:27,302 --> 01:14:30,782
[Big-nose's flipped pile succeeds!]

1181
01:14:30,783 --> 01:14:33,318
- Good job, Jae Soon.
- Kwang Ja...

1182
01:14:33,319 --> 01:14:35,450
Thanks, Kwang Ja.

1183
01:14:35,813 --> 01:14:38,367
Why do we only get used
and cast aside?

1184
01:14:38,368 --> 01:14:41,126
- Thanks, Kwang Ja.
- We won thanks to you.

1185
01:14:41,127 --> 01:14:42,772
[Kwang Ja got completely used.]

1186
01:14:43,612 --> 01:14:46,267
Kwang Ja, we won thanks to you.

1187
01:14:46,587 --> 01:14:48,887
It's a very cruel world.

1188
01:14:54,252 --> 01:14:56,551
- I'm sorry.
- No, it's okay.

1189
01:14:57,128 --> 01:15:00,409
You looked really pretty while
trying to build the tier.

1190
01:15:00,928 --> 01:15:05,195
Ji Suk Jin and Yoo Jae Soon
win second place.

1191
01:15:06,481 --> 01:15:10,302
Okay, this is your final chance.

1192
01:15:11,109 --> 01:15:16,029
This will be the final chance for the three
winning couples to make their swap.

1193
01:15:16,030 --> 01:15:19,714
- We'll start with third place winners.
- I have no idea what this is for.

1194
01:15:19,715 --> 01:15:22,121
[What is the mystery behind these ropes?]

1195
01:15:23,127 --> 01:15:28,127
[A mind battle to swap out not only theirs,
but those of their opponents as well.]

1196
01:15:29,723 --> 01:15:33,741
[An unexpected twist from the tiny couple
who has been on the losing end all day!]

1197
01:15:33,742 --> 01:15:35,839
He's Korea's Tom Cruise.

1198
01:15:37,917 --> 01:15:40,291
[Jong Sook and Soo Hong's selection.]

1199
01:15:41,603 --> 01:15:45,823
[Jong Kook and Soo Hong swapped it out for
Hana and Min Gyo after the previous mission.]

1200
01:15:48,162 --> 01:15:51,441
[Swaps theirs out for Hana and Min Gyo's.]

1201
01:15:52,099 --> 01:15:53,831
[Let's help each other out.]

1202
01:15:54,573 --> 01:15:57,549
Okay, we're going to make our swap.

1203
01:15:57,550 --> 01:15:58,997
[Jae Soon and Suk Jin.]

1204
01:16:01,739 --> 01:16:05,627
[Swaps theirs out for Jong Sook
and Soo Hong's without even hesitating.]

1205
01:16:07,643 --> 01:16:11,292
- That was a good move.
- I know that they're up to something.

1206
01:16:11,293 --> 01:16:14,359
Remember what I did for you earlier?
Remember that.

1207
01:16:14,360 --> 01:16:17,069
I seriously set it up so that
you don't even have to do anything.

1208
01:16:17,070 --> 01:16:20,950
- You know what I mean, right?
- They helped us out earlier, didn't they?

1209
01:16:20,951 --> 01:16:25,208
- Just do what's right for you, not them.
- They helped out to make it easier for us.

1210
01:16:25,209 --> 01:16:29,026
- Yes, we helped you out on purpose.
- We gave you the best case scenario.

1211
01:16:29,027 --> 01:16:30,514
You saw what they just
did to us, didn't you?

1212
01:16:30,515 --> 01:16:33,703
This is the final game.
Helping them is going to make you lose.

1213
01:16:36,926 --> 01:16:40,213
- Think about our relationship.
- Ha Ha, this is the best one.

1214
01:16:40,214 --> 01:16:43,727
Do we have a relationship with them?

1215
01:16:45,222 --> 01:16:49,052
- We helped you guys out earlier!
- You're so cold hearted.

1216
01:16:50,186 --> 01:16:55,165
[Cold hearted Min Gyo places Jong Sook
and Soo Hong in front of the metal chain.]

1217
01:16:55,166 --> 01:16:58,043
Thank you!

1218
01:17:03,483 --> 01:17:06,845
[Completely unexpected results.]

1219
01:17:13,771 --> 01:17:17,813
[But just what is the meaning
of these ropes?]

1220
01:17:19,390 --> 01:17:23,264
[Off to the final mission site.]

1221
01:17:25,825 --> 01:17:28,281
- What is it?
- It's a rescue boat!

1222
01:17:30,379 --> 01:17:33,599
[A row of rescue boats are lined up
at the end of the dock.]

1223
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:35,552
You're not expecting us to
row over to Yeouido, are you?

1224
01:17:35,860 --> 01:17:38,806
- The final 12 survivors.
- Yes.

1225
01:17:38,807 --> 01:17:44,155
I will now tell you the final mission of
how to escape this island.

1226
01:17:44,156 --> 01:17:46,074
I really want to escape.

1227
01:17:46,075 --> 01:17:47,788
Here's your final mission.

1228
01:17:47,789 --> 01:17:50,738
Unravel the twisted fate.

1229
01:17:50,739 --> 01:17:54,846
[Final mission-
Unravel the twisted fate.]

1230
01:17:54,847 --> 01:17:58,475
So the thinnest rope would've
been the best?

1231
01:17:59,020 --> 01:18:03,924
There are six different types of ropes
that are tied up to the boat in front of you.

1232
01:18:04,227 --> 01:18:08,551
Even though the way they're twisted up
together is similar to your fates

1233
01:18:08,552 --> 01:18:14,219
the team that successfully unravels
the tangle first wins the entire race.

1234
01:18:15,339 --> 01:18:17,797
I think our rope may be the easiest.

1235
01:18:17,798 --> 01:18:20,117
The rubber is going to be really hard.

1236
01:18:20,118 --> 01:18:22,759
Ours is the one at the end.

1237
01:18:23,089 --> 01:18:25,415
Which one was ours?
Is it the metal chain over there?

1238
01:18:26,719 --> 01:18:28,819
Ours is the metal chain.

1239
01:18:29,770 --> 01:18:33,071
[Just which team will be the first
to unravel the tangled mess?]

1240
01:18:33,317 --> 01:18:36,961
If you break the rope,
then you fail immediately.

1241
01:18:36,962 --> 01:18:42,245
Please be careful while unraveling it,
and you know what your mission is?

1242
01:18:42,246 --> 01:18:43,479
Get started!

1243
01:18:43,480 --> 01:18:46,993
[Final survival mission- Start.]

1244
01:18:48,293 --> 01:18:50,954
Tell me what to do because
I don't know what I'm doing.

1245
01:18:51,262 --> 01:18:54,061
We have to just unravel it.
No explanations are necessary.

1246
01:18:54,062 --> 01:18:55,681
We just have to unravel it.

1247
01:18:56,677 --> 01:19:00,858
Once you get it all untangled,
lift up your boat above your heads!

1248
01:19:00,859 --> 01:19:02,951
[First team to lift up the boat after
unraveling wins the race.]

1249
01:19:02,952 --> 01:19:06,918
[These were done by knot experts.]

1250
01:19:06,919 --> 01:19:08,828
How do I do this one?

1251
01:19:08,829 --> 01:19:13,773
[Sense of urgency...
but not unraveling as they want.]

1252
01:19:15,259 --> 01:19:17,232
Why did they knot it so tightly?

1253
01:19:17,233 --> 01:19:19,471
Wow, they went too far.

1254
01:19:20,390 --> 01:19:22,164
Okay, I got this one.

1255
01:19:23,224 --> 01:19:26,220
[Hana and Min Gyo's thick rope
seems to be the easiest.]

1256
01:19:26,590 --> 01:19:28,635
We got it.
We got this.

1257
01:19:30,442 --> 01:19:33,836
[Jae Soon and Suk Jin's rope
is on the easier side as well.]

1258
01:19:33,837 --> 01:19:36,954
- Let go, you can't hold onto it.
- Hold it on this side.

1259
01:19:36,955 --> 01:19:40,536
- Let go for a second.
- I think there's a method to this.

1260
01:19:40,537 --> 01:19:43,124
Someone knew what they
were doing.

1261
01:19:43,125 --> 01:19:46,092
[Does Jae Rim know something
about knots?]

1262
01:19:46,093 --> 01:19:49,008
I used to love tying knots.

1263
01:19:49,009 --> 01:19:51,146
Wow, Jae Rim's really good at this!

1264
01:19:51,147 --> 01:19:55,659
- Okay, I got this. I love you, Min Gyo.
- We're going to win this.

1265
01:19:58,064 --> 01:20:00,596
[Hana and Min Gyo are making progress
through the strength of their love?]

1266
01:20:00,597 --> 01:20:02,791
See?
They're getting it so fast.

1267
01:20:04,478 --> 01:20:08,450
[They can't even get a good grip
on the metal chain.]

1268
01:20:08,451 --> 01:20:11,507
- Wow, look at this knot.
- I can't believe they did this to us.

1269
01:20:13,463 --> 01:20:15,610
- I got this unraveled.
- You did?

1270
01:20:15,611 --> 01:20:19,739
[Dong Min says he unraveled it...
but it's not looking like it.]

1271
01:20:19,740 --> 01:20:23,115
- I'll give it a try.
- I need to find something sharp.

1272
01:20:23,116 --> 01:20:28,006
[Dong Min leaves the knot to Ji Hyo
and steps away to find something sharp.]

1273
01:20:28,007 --> 01:20:31,416
- How did they tie it up like this?
- A knotting expert did this.

1274
01:20:31,417 --> 01:20:34,853
- An expert did this.
- Let go, you can't keep holding onto it.

1275
01:20:34,854 --> 01:20:37,568
[Big-nose keeps holding onto the rope
without really helping anything.]

1276
01:20:39,643 --> 01:20:43,137
We're at an advantage with this.
We have to unravel this too.

1277
01:20:44,348 --> 01:20:46,364
- This is good.
- Let go, Big-nose.

1278
01:20:48,539 --> 01:20:50,694
They knotted this so tight!

1279
01:20:50,695 --> 01:20:55,769
[Who will be the first to successfully
unravel all the knots?]

1280
01:20:58,085 --> 01:21:00,032
They're almost done already!

1281
01:21:01,005 --> 01:21:03,886
[Hana and Min Gyo's knots are
coming to a complete unravel.]

1282
01:21:05,648 --> 01:21:09,696
Oh my goodness.
I got so lucky with my man.

1283
01:21:13,906 --> 01:21:16,805
[Hana throws down his wig in
his efforts to unravel the knots.]

1284
01:21:16,806 --> 01:21:19,090
I'd still love you even if you were bald.

1285
01:21:20,060 --> 01:21:23,255
- They're almost done already!
- We're almost done, too.

1286
01:21:24,680 --> 01:21:27,909
[Kwang Ja and Jae Rim's rope becomes
unraveled with Jae Rim's expertise.]

1287
01:21:29,396 --> 01:21:32,242
[Jae Soon and Suk Jin are
also getting close.]

1288
01:21:34,648 --> 01:21:37,721
[Meanwhile, this team is still
struggling with their knots.]

1289
01:21:37,722 --> 01:21:39,564
[As well as this team.]

1290
01:21:39,565 --> 01:21:41,627
I think we need to get this one first
before we can unravel that one.

1291
01:21:43,525 --> 01:21:52,665
[Hana and Min Gyo vs Jae Rim and Kwang Ja
vs Jae Soon and Suk Jin.]

1292
01:21:52,666 --> 01:21:55,829
[A race against time
between these three teams!]

1293
01:21:55,830 --> 01:21:57,204
