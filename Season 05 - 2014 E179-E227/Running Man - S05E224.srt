you will have to choose the site of which
your first mission will take place.

How are we supposed to
break this down?

106

[All the boxes are sized differently.]

107
00:06:31,609 --> 00:06:36,156

be easier to break down?]

00:06:37,765 --> 00:06:40,252
[Ten minutes ago.]

109
00:06:40,253 --> 00:06:42,851
[The female guests themselves chose
which boxes to hide in.]

110

I shouldn't have any problems
hiding in this one.

111
00:06:46,157 --> 00:06:48,045
This one is way too small.

112

00:07:15,229 --> 00:07:17,180
[Jong Kook and Ga Yeon are almost
finished with their cleanup.]

119
00:07:17,682 --> 00:07:19,726

were quicker!]

120

right on their heels.]

121
00:07:24,259 --> 00:07:27,883

are in first place.

126

- No, I saw her with something.
- What? We're all finished!

128
00:07:47,534 --> 00:07:51,172
- She has something in her skirt.
- Can we play back the video?

129
00:07:54,017 --> 00:07:57,922
- I'm telling you that I've got nothing.
- Hand it over before I let Ga Yeon loose.

130
00:07:58,492 --> 00:08:01,351
[A scary warning.]

131
00:08:01,352 --> 00:08:04,420
- Before I have Ga Yeon go over there.
- I can't believe So Min.

132
00:08:04,421 --> 00:08:07,406

[Finally fesses up to her tricks.]

134
00:08:15,549 --> 00:08:19,761
[Jong Kook and Ga Yeon are the new winners,
and get the chance to choose their site.]

135
00:08:22,447 --> 00:08:24,561
I'm going to pick this one.

136
00:08:25,885 --> 00:08:29,837

137
00:08:29,838 --> 00:08:32,193

147
00:09:07,309 --> 00:09:11,755
- I really like to swim, too.
- Then you should've been on the summer team.

148
00:09:11,756 --> 00:09:15,407

149
00:09:16,859 --> 00:09:18,281
[Laughing behind her hands again.]

150
00:09:21,148 --> 00:09:24,345
[A refreshing convertible ride

00:09:29,075 --> 00:09:32,449
[Trying to relieve the summer
in the winter wind.]

153
00:09:33,314 --> 00:09:36,559
Why are you filming this?
We're freezing over here!

154
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,785

[The three summer teams' mission site-
A swimming pool.]

156

[Two diving boards are set up
in the middle of the pool.]

Here they come.
Over here, Goo Roo!

160
00:10:07,878 --> 00:10:09,761
Look at the way Ga Yeon runs.

161
00:10:09,762 --> 00:10:12,215

these two actresses prance over.]

164
00:10:16,478 --> 00:10:19,361
They're running like little girls,
and Ga Yeon runs like an athlete.

165
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:22,570
[Do not walk, but run!
Running Man's formidable guest.]

166
00:10:22,571 --> 00:10:25,030
Welcome to our summer teams.

167
00:10:25,031 --> 00:10:29,732
Summer is all about swimming.
Your mission is- 'Love is to roll around.'

168
00:10:30,441 --> 00:10:35,312
Both members from each team will tumble
three times while on the diving board.

169
00:10:35,313 --> 00:10:42,599
Then the partners will stand on the red end
of the board without falling into the water

170
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,480
and throw up a huge heart sign
while facing one another.

171
00:10:48,764 --> 00:10:51,512
- Should you fail, you'd have to try again.
- So Min says she can't tumble forward.

172
00:10:51,513 --> 00:10:53,366
- Why not?
- I keep going sideways.

173
00:10:53,367 --> 00:10:56,394
Is it okay if we don't fall in the water?
Really?

174
00:10:56,739 --> 00:11:00,559
It's like this game was
created for these two.

175
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,159
Ga Yeon will probably
be really good at this game.

176
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:06,469
You'll have to roll three times.
Men and women at each diving boards.

177
00:11:11,133 --> 00:11:12,808
Please go easy on me.

178
00:11:12,809 --> 00:11:17,079
[Ga Yeon's unfailing polite manners.]

179
00:11:17,815 --> 00:11:19,983
Can we just try it?

180
00:11:21,594 --> 00:11:23,735
[So Min and Goo Roo are unsure of their
abilities and attempt a practice roll.]

181
00:11:23,736 --> 00:11:25,752
- You can't practice.
- We can't practice?

182
00:11:25,753 --> 00:11:27,050
See?

183
00:11:29,964 --> 00:11:32,125
What am I going to do?
I can't do it straight.

184
00:11:34,372 --> 00:11:36,813
I'm afraid of heights.

185
00:11:39,049 --> 00:11:42,032
[The diving board gradually narrows.]

186
00:11:42,033 --> 00:11:44,941
We have to roll three times
and stand on the red part?

187
00:11:44,942 --> 00:11:46,430
That's right.

188
00:11:46,431 --> 00:11:48,375
[Summer mission goal-
Roll three times and stand on the red part.]

189
00:11:49,739 --> 00:11:52,063
- We have to roll three times.
- Ready!

190
00:11:52,064 --> 00:11:53,917
[Love is a tumble-
First couple: Kwang Soo and So Min.]

191
00:11:53,918 --> 00:11:55,433
Wait.

192
00:11:55,862 --> 00:11:57,831
[How am I going to do this?]

193
00:11:57,832 --> 00:11:59,781
So Min, let's just get this done
and get out of here!

194
00:11:59,782 --> 00:12:03,101
- Seriously!
- But I keep rolling sideways!

195
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:09,279
[The fear inducing height
of the diving board...]

196
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:12,177
- It's okay.
- But I'm scared!

197
00:12:12,785 --> 00:12:15,807
I want to go home and see my mom.

198
00:12:17,487 --> 00:12:18,897
Let's do this, So Min!

199
00:12:18,898 --> 00:12:21,112
[Jeon So Min, fighting!]

200
00:12:21,692 --> 00:12:25,127
- Seriously... I'm sorry, Kwang Soo.
- I'm going to cheer you on!

201
00:12:25,128 --> 00:12:28,175
- No, it's okay.
- It's way too narrow!

202
00:12:28,176 --> 00:12:30,210
Three rolls in a row.

203
00:12:30,211 --> 00:12:32,856
[Love is a tumble- Start!]

204
00:12:34,674 --> 00:12:37,293
[Kwang Soo succeeds on his first roll.]

205
00:12:43,532 --> 00:12:45,776
[Who is that?]

206
00:12:46,605 --> 00:12:49,745
[Just like her practice roll,
rolls sideways and falls in.]

207
00:12:50,301 --> 00:12:53,023
[A refreshing failure.]

208
00:12:55,037 --> 00:12:58,300
[While So Min was busy falling in...
add another name to that list.]

209
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:04,895
[The narrowing diving board is no easy feat.]

210
00:13:07,034 --> 00:13:09,354
Oh no!
This is bad!

211
00:13:10,756 --> 00:13:13,845
[Love is a difficult path to travel on.]

212
00:13:13,972 --> 00:13:18,416
- Goo Roo!
- Seeing them fall in is so scary!

213
00:13:18,417 --> 00:13:21,272
- So Min, are you okay?
- I'm okay, but where did I fall in?

214
00:13:21,273 --> 00:13:22,818
- What?
- How did I fall in?

215
00:13:22,819 --> 00:13:25,458
You were right about rolling sideways.

216
00:13:25,459 --> 00:13:26,627
[Doesn't even know how she fell in.]

217
00:13:26,628 --> 00:13:29,228
[First couple, Kwang Soo and So Min,
fails their first attempt.]

218
00:13:29,821 --> 00:13:31,946
That's really hard.

219
00:13:34,758 --> 00:13:38,785
[Love is a tumble-
Second couple: Jae Suk and Goo Roo.]

220
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:43,569
How am I expected to do this up here?

221
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:46,567
- This is scary, Goo Roo.
- This is no joke.

222
00:13:46,568 --> 00:13:49,535
Goo Roo!
It's three rolls, okay?

223
00:13:49,536 --> 00:13:51,958
[Saying it is easy...]

224
00:13:52,251 --> 00:13:53,602
Ready!

225
00:13:54,254 --> 00:13:56,090
Set...

226
00:13:56,091 --> 00:13:59,850
- I'm sure falling in is no big deal.
- Just do it!

227
00:13:59,885 --> 00:14:02,626
[What you're doing is even more scary...]

228
00:14:02,627 --> 00:14:05,018
- Falling in is no big deal.
- Why are you sitting down?

229
00:14:05,019 --> 00:14:07,672
We have to overcome our fear.
You know that, right?

230
00:14:07,673 --> 00:14:09,776
Can we just get it over with?

231
00:14:10,189 --> 00:14:13,231
- Are you getting annoyed with me?
- She's getting annoyed, so just do it!

232
00:14:13,232 --> 00:14:16,392
You have a bit of a temper, don't you?
You're kind of scaring me.

233
00:14:16,393 --> 00:14:19,148
I think we should just do it instead
of scaring ourselves even more.

234
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:21,368
Ready!

235
00:14:21,946 --> 00:14:23,674
[Love is a tumble-
Jae Suk and Goo Roo- Start!]

236
00:14:39,878 --> 00:14:41,754
Goo Roo is good,
and has good direction!

237
00:14:41,755 --> 00:14:43,196
[Goo Roo successfully
completes her first roll.]

238
00:14:43,197 --> 00:14:46,998
- I fell flat on my face!
- I fell on my face, too!

239
00:14:47,033 --> 00:14:50,651
- Ugh, I fell on my face!
- You can't help but fall on your face!

240
00:14:50,652 --> 00:14:52,339
[Falls flat on his face.]

241
00:14:54,762 --> 00:14:56,130
- Are you okay?
- Excuse me?

242
00:14:56,131 --> 00:14:57,780
- Shall we go?
- Excuse me?

243
00:15:00,534 --> 00:15:01,955
I was just asking if you were okay.

244
00:15:01,956 --> 00:15:04,051
- I'm not sure.
- Really?

245
00:15:04,052 --> 00:15:06,535
- Ga Yeon!
- Yes?

246
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:09,373
[Nervous female fighter.]

247
00:15:09,374 --> 00:15:11,239
Why are you so startled?

248
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:13,690
Is there anything you'd like to say?

249
00:15:13,691 --> 00:15:16,060
- No.
- You don't?

250
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:20,192
Ga Yeon's deep voice is
very attractive.

251
00:15:21,799 --> 00:15:24,341
My voice is high,
and her voice is deep.

252
00:15:24,342 --> 00:15:26,465
Your voices would be
very good together in a duet.

253
00:15:26,466 --> 00:15:28,267
- It should be the other way around.
- Ready.

254
00:15:30,899 --> 00:15:32,664
[Relax, female fighter.]

255
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:35,020
- One, two...
- I think we can do this!

256
00:15:35,021 --> 00:15:36,844
One, two, three!

257
00:15:42,837 --> 00:15:45,011
[What just happened?]

258
00:15:46,573 --> 00:15:49,945
[Attacking Kkuk is something that can
only be done from behind his back.]

259
00:15:50,479 --> 00:15:53,675
- That's how you fall in the water.
- What are you doing down there?

260
00:15:54,133 --> 00:15:57,356
Why do you keep grabbing the ledge?
That's how you should fall in.

261
00:15:57,357 --> 00:16:00,141
- Now the game has officially begun.
- This is fun!

262
00:16:02,049 --> 00:16:03,804
[Kkuk is on the move.]

263
00:16:04,818 --> 00:16:07,185
[Immediately changes their tune.]

264
00:16:07,186 --> 00:16:09,692
- We didn't do it on purpose.
- I didn't do it.

265
00:16:09,693 --> 00:16:11,941
- We really could've done it.
- Okay.

266
00:16:11,942 --> 00:16:14,958
- Now that I've fallen in, it's no big deal.
- It really isn't once you've fallen in.

267
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:17,246
I don't want to fall in again.

268
00:16:17,247 --> 00:16:18,708
So Min.

269
00:16:18,709 --> 00:16:21,608
You should look in the mirror.
Your hair is a hot mess.

270
00:16:22,511 --> 00:16:24,522
Why are you telling her that?

271
00:16:24,523 --> 00:16:26,549
We haven't said anything because she looks
funny, so why are you telling her that?

272
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:28,743
Her hair looks like strands
of wet seaweed.

273
00:16:29,454 --> 00:16:31,670
[So Min's cool, and laidback attitude.]

274
00:16:31,671 --> 00:16:34,722
- Do you think her forehead's too wide?
- No, it's pretty.

275
00:16:34,723 --> 00:16:36,834
- My forehead?
- No, nothing!

276
00:16:36,835 --> 00:16:39,948
No, not at all!
You look very pretty!

277
00:16:41,642 --> 00:16:44,343
Jong Kook takes the cake when it comes
to upsetting our female guests.

278
00:16:44,344 --> 00:16:49,086
I was really shocked when I saw that
you're much shorter than I thought you'd be.

279
00:16:49,121 --> 00:16:50,509
Me?

280
00:16:53,696 --> 00:16:56,287
- I see.
- He's there, too!

281
00:16:56,288 --> 00:16:59,939
- He's pissed, too.
- He gets pissed very easily.

282
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:02,513
- How are you any different from Ha Ha?
- Excuse me?

283
00:17:03,009 --> 00:17:06,004
[Kkuk is no match when it comes
to So Min's barbed comments.]

284
00:17:08,488 --> 00:17:11,110
['O' snow park in Ilsan.]

285
00:17:12,789 --> 00:17:16,958
[Wow, it's snowing!]

286
00:17:17,793 --> 00:17:22,035
[First snowfall for these couples.]

287
00:17:22,036 --> 00:17:24,641
- Wow, I'm so happy!
- It's snowing!

288
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:29,780
[Soo Jin likes to play around!]

289
00:17:29,781 --> 00:17:32,128
Wow, this is really nice!

290
00:17:32,129 --> 00:17:34,104
[An extremely different feel
from our summer couples.]

291
00:17:34,105 --> 00:17:36,475
I'd like to welcome our
winter couples to winter.

292
00:17:36,476 --> 00:17:39,950
- Wow, it's winter!
- Winter is all about sledding, isn't it?

293
00:17:39,951 --> 00:17:41,673
- Yes, that's right.
- Your winter mission is...

294
00:17:41,674 --> 00:17:44,201
none other than, 'Escape the Igloo'.

295
00:17:44,202 --> 00:17:46,710
- Escape the Igloo?
- Are they somehow locking us in?

296
00:17:46,711 --> 00:17:51,276
'Winter is all about sledding, that's why
your mission is, Escape the Igloo.'

297
00:17:51,277 --> 00:17:52,796
[Sledding will have to be next time.]

298
00:17:53,286 --> 00:17:58,355
All the couples will go inside the igloo,
and dance along to the music

299
00:17:58,390 --> 00:18:04,840
and run outside as soon as the whistle blows
and grab a half a piece of the broken heart.

300
00:18:04,841 --> 00:18:10,830
The couple must piece together a completed
whole heart in order to pass the mission.

301
00:18:12,438 --> 00:18:14,464
- What's this?
- It's an igloo!

302
00:18:14,465 --> 00:18:17,566
[The three couples' current half hearts.]

303
00:18:17,567 --> 00:18:19,768
It's an igloo!

304
00:18:19,769 --> 00:18:23,248
- Wow, it's really nice in here!
- It's actually cozy in here.

305
00:18:23,249 --> 00:18:25,746
[A cozy dance space for the three couples.]

306
00:18:26,418 --> 00:18:28,803
[Escape the Igloo- Start.]

307
00:18:30,137 --> 00:18:33,415
[First song-
'To My Boyfriend' by Fin.K.L.]

308
00:18:33,416 --> 00:18:35,594
Let's see Soo Jin's dance.

309
00:18:36,466 --> 00:18:39,254
- So cute!
- She's so cute!

310
00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:43,160
[A cutie with the sweet eye smile.]

311
00:18:43,161 --> 00:18:44,554
Sung Kyung!

312
00:18:50,795 --> 00:18:53,648
[A couple dance with Ha Ha.]

313
00:18:54,362 --> 00:18:56,286
[This is fun!]

314
00:18:56,287 --> 00:18:57,854
Ji Hyo!

315
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:02,378
[No matter what the song is,
always dancing the 'Hot Issue' dance.]

316
00:19:13,393 --> 00:19:15,822
<i>'I'm yours!'</i>

317
00:19:17,037 --> 00:19:19,806
[Let's escape the igloo!]

318
00:19:23,469 --> 00:19:25,798
[Big-nose's fighting spirit.]

319
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:29,186
Get out there, Suk Jin!

320
00:19:30,588 --> 00:19:33,169
[You're not going anywhere!]

321
00:19:38,908 --> 00:19:40,817
[Ji Hyo makes her escape!]

322
00:19:41,432 --> 00:19:45,223
[Grabs the sliver of a chance,
and escapes in a blink of an eye.]

323
00:19:45,224 --> 00:19:47,297
[That's our Ace!]

324
00:19:47,298 --> 00:19:49,266
You have to match the heart, Ji Hyo.

325
00:19:50,908 --> 00:19:53,142
[30 different sized half heart pieces.]

326
00:19:58,804 --> 00:20:00,338
I think she's already got it.

327
00:20:01,202 --> 00:20:06,128
[A difference of 5mm-
Suk Jin and Ji Hyo, fails.]

328
00:20:06,129 --> 00:20:08,659
- There's a tiny bit of a difference.
- They're different?

329
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:10,688
It looks like the right fit from here.

330
00:20:11,356 --> 00:20:14,620
[Mission point- Tell the difference of
by their eyesight only.]

331
00:20:15,426 --> 00:20:18,553
[Song number two-
'My Ear Candy' by Baek Ji Young.]

332
00:20:20,227 --> 00:20:22,970
[Everybody, it's time to dance!]

333
00:20:26,442 --> 00:20:28,062
[Soo Jin, let's go!]

334
00:20:35,667 --> 00:20:38,206
[Couple dancing with Gary.]

335
00:20:42,536 --> 00:20:44,782
[Gary is feeling the groove.]

336
00:20:45,124 --> 00:20:48,843
<i>I love you... I love you!</i>

337
00:20:52,354 --> 00:20:55,941
She's not as sweet and demure
as she seems!

338
00:20:56,929 --> 00:20:59,223
[A new side of Kyung Soo Jin
is discovered!]

339
00:20:59,664 --> 00:21:02,795
<i>My ear's candy!
As sweet as honey!</i>

340
00:21:02,796 --> 00:21:06,897
<i>Melt me with your sweet voice!</i>

341
00:21:09,574 --> 00:21:11,819
[The igloo is starting to get steamed up.]

342
00:21:19,777 --> 00:21:21,271
Ji Hyo!

343
00:21:21,272 --> 00:21:23,612
Wait, I'm going to get in there.

344
00:21:23,613 --> 00:21:26,522
[Discovers some wiggle room.]

345
00:21:31,792 --> 00:21:34,993
[Ha Ha escapes.]

346
00:21:34,994 --> 00:21:37,067
It's small and thin.

347
00:21:37,068 --> 00:21:38,547
Get the small and thin one.

348
00:21:40,533 --> 00:21:44,402
Ji Hyo... help me.

349
00:21:47,614 --> 00:21:50,340
In the middle... but towards the left.

350
00:21:50,557 --> 00:21:52,842
[I don't know which one to choose!]

351
00:21:52,843 --> 00:21:54,890
To the left!

352
00:21:55,555 --> 00:21:57,326
[Ha Ha makes his selection.]

353
00:21:59,289 --> 00:22:00,783
I can already tell that it's wrong.

354
00:22:02,186 --> 00:22:04,990
- I can already tell that it's too big.
- You should've picked that one!

355
00:22:06,146 --> 00:22:09,309
[I'll grind it down to make it fit.]

356
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:17,147
[Ha Ha and Sung Kyung, fail.]

357
00:22:17,148 --> 00:22:19,387
It's the never-ending game.

358
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:23,205
We'll never be able to get this
unless we start helping each other.

359
00:22:23,206 --> 00:22:27,456
- There's no way to get this!
- How are we expected to get this?

360
00:22:28,733 --> 00:22:31,521
It seriously is such a miniscule difference!

361
00:22:31,522 --> 00:22:35,570
No, it's not this one!
It's not this one either!

362
00:22:35,571 --> 00:22:38,585
- No, this definitely isn't it!
- This isn't it either!

363
00:22:38,586 --> 00:22:40,867
[All the couples explodes out in anger!]

364
00:22:41,245 --> 00:22:43,851
Even as we're out here...
Oh, it's this one!

365
00:22:45,183 --> 00:22:49,012
- This is it, isn't it?
- I have a question.

366
00:22:49,568 --> 00:22:52,605
Did the summer team go to
a swimming pool?

367
00:22:52,606 --> 00:22:54,886
- Yes.
- What are they doing there?

368
00:22:54,887 --> 00:22:57,625
- Tumbling on the diving board.
- On the diving board?

369
00:22:57,626 --> 00:22:59,307
Thank you for this.

370
00:22:59,308 --> 00:23:01,465
Thank you.
On the diving board?

371
00:23:01,466 --> 00:23:03,977
Let's work hard and match
our hearts.

372
00:23:03,978 --> 00:23:07,532
- We can do this. Thank you for this.
- Sorry for complaining!

373
00:23:09,375 --> 00:23:12,338
- I love Running Man!
- Let's work hard.

374
00:23:12,946 --> 00:23:15,515
[Meanwhile, the summer teams...]

375
00:23:16,518 --> 00:23:18,752
[Jae Suk and Goo Roo's turn.]

376
00:23:19,477 --> 00:23:22,178
[Succeeds the first tumble.]

377
00:23:26,701 --> 00:23:29,923
[Succeeds the second tumble.]

378
00:23:31,739 --> 00:23:34,024
I'm so scared!

379
00:23:34,025 --> 00:23:36,178
[The edge is right in front of their eyes!]

380
00:23:36,938 --> 00:23:39,345
Goo Roo, you go first.

381
00:23:40,511 --> 00:23:42,260
You can do it if you put your head
really close to the chest.

382
00:23:42,261 --> 00:23:45,714
No, it's not going to work. I guarantee it.
You're just going to fall in.

383
00:23:45,715 --> 00:23:47,921
There's no way I'm doing it.
I'm for sure going to fall in.

384
00:23:47,922 --> 00:23:50,690
[She could've said it in nicer terms...]

385
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:54,730
No, you're going to fall in for sure.

386
00:23:54,731 --> 00:23:56,788
It may be possible.

387
00:23:56,789 --> 00:23:59,699
[Goo Roo maintains her hope
and attempts to make the roll.]

388
00:24:00,313 --> 00:24:03,887
- Hey, I think you can do it!
- No, she's going to fall in.

389
00:24:04,678 --> 00:24:07,726
[Just like So Min said,
falls right into the water.]

390
00:24:11,055 --> 00:24:13,530
Goo Roo, you did it.

391
00:24:13,531 --> 00:24:16,907
Goo Roo, you did it.
That was a nice dive.

392
00:24:16,908 --> 00:24:18,866
That was really nice.

393
00:24:19,443 --> 00:24:22,016
We're going to get it done this time.

394
00:24:22,916 --> 00:24:25,310
[Can't let her show me up!
Jae Suk's own slapstick comedy.]

395
00:24:25,311 --> 00:24:26,932
I think my knee's busted.

396
00:24:26,933 --> 00:24:29,374
- What did you do?
- How did you do that while crawling?

397
00:24:29,375 --> 00:24:31,264
My knee, get out!

398
00:24:31,265 --> 00:24:33,868
Do you know?
My knee, get out.

399
00:24:33,869 --> 00:24:36,012
[Let's all succeed, and let's all get out!]

400
00:24:36,646 --> 00:24:39,231
[Attempting the three rolls
one person at a time.]

401
00:24:39,232 --> 00:24:41,050
Three in a row.

402
00:24:41,051 --> 00:24:43,760
One, two...

403
00:24:44,169 --> 00:24:48,234
[He's already at the edge!]

404
00:24:49,107 --> 00:24:52,830
He already knows! He already
knows how this is going to end.

405
00:24:57,703 --> 00:24:59,466
- I can't even watch this.
- Watch and see how this is going to end.

406
00:25:00,622 --> 00:25:02,578
I wish I could help you.

407
00:25:02,579 --> 00:25:05,045
[A lonely battle against himself
on the diving board.]

408
00:25:05,046 --> 00:25:07,762
I really don't want to do this!
I can't do this!

409
00:25:07,763 --> 00:25:09,681
- I'll take the fall for him.
- No, it's okay.

410
00:25:09,682 --> 00:25:11,671
- I can take the fall for him.
- No, I'll give it a try.

411
00:25:11,672 --> 00:25:15,933
- This might be possible.
- No, it's not.

412
00:25:17,361 --> 00:25:20,325
- I'll take the fall for you instead.
- She's an expert at this already.

413
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:24,334
- No, I'll give it a try.
- No, it won't work. Your torso is too long.

414
00:25:25,324 --> 00:25:29,756
[Even Kwang Soo can't avoid
So Min's adamant statements.]

415
00:25:30,142 --> 00:25:33,579
- Why is she standing out there?
- Why are you offering to take his fall?

416
00:25:34,985 --> 00:25:37,247
Stop making this more burdensome,
and just go away!

417
00:25:37,248 --> 00:25:39,545
- This isn't a drama!
- Why are you acting like that?

418
00:25:39,546 --> 00:25:41,702
- Why would you take the fall instead?
- I'll be the black knight.

419
00:25:41,703 --> 00:25:45,419
- Why would you do that?
- I heard that So Min likes to drink.

420
00:25:45,897 --> 00:25:48,513
You know what So Min said
to us earlier?

421
00:25:48,514 --> 00:25:50,333
'I wish I could have a beer.'

422
00:25:50,334 --> 00:25:52,311
- Seriously?
- Yes.

423
00:25:52,312 --> 00:25:55,281
When we passed by some snack carts,
she said she wishes she could have a beer.

424
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:57,952
[Black knight, So Min,
takes the challenge for Kwang Soo.]

425
00:26:04,659 --> 00:26:05,956
So Min!

426
00:26:07,858 --> 00:26:11,549
[The black knight protects
her partner, Kwang Soo.]

427
00:26:13,402 --> 00:26:16,860
[This is for my Kwang Soo...]

428
00:26:17,178 --> 00:26:20,668
[The perfect pose,
and the perfect artistic expression!]

429
00:26:20,669 --> 00:26:23,149
You looked really pretty
as you were falling in.

430
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:27,225
- I'm serious!
- So Min, you're taking Kwang Soo's thunder.

431
00:26:27,226 --> 00:26:29,115
Give me a chance to make people laugh!

432
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:32,520
Does my hair look funny?

433
00:26:35,363 --> 00:26:37,742
He kept making fun of my big forehead.

434
00:26:37,743 --> 00:26:40,626
Jong Kook... he's dead.

435
00:26:42,125 --> 00:26:44,573
[Jong Kook and Ga Yeon-
The athletic couple's turn.]

436
00:26:48,671 --> 00:26:50,912
[Ga Yeon's short remaining distance
poses a threat.]

437
00:26:51,505 --> 00:26:54,661
- This is already over.
- No, you can do it.

438
00:26:54,662 --> 00:26:59,447
[It's not over until it's over.]

439
00:26:59,448 --> 00:27:01,822
- You can do it!
- It's okay!

440
00:27:01,823 --> 00:27:05,173
- I can do this.
- No, the distance is too short.

441
00:27:05,174 --> 00:27:07,716
- You're just going to fall in.
- It's not bad once you fall in.

442
00:27:08,271 --> 00:27:11,465
So Min is the icon of misfortune.

443
00:27:11,466 --> 00:27:14,490
[Icon of misfortune
hides behind the sweet smile.]

444
00:27:15,446 --> 00:27:17,971
- You can do it.
- Why am I being so whiny?

445
00:27:19,318 --> 00:27:21,552
- No, you're not!
- Ga Yeon's getting mad.

446
00:27:21,556 --> 00:27:24,928
[At a closer look, she's
just a scared twenty year old.]

447
00:27:25,672 --> 00:27:28,987
- Ga Yeon's sweeter than she looks.
- Just roll forward, Ga Yeon.

448
00:27:35,449 --> 00:27:38,303
I thought she was going to
send a flying kick!

449
00:27:38,304 --> 00:27:39,305
[Fighter's true spirits are coming out.]

450
00:27:39,306 --> 00:27:43,836
- Ga Yeon, how about I lower my speech?
- Why bother asking when he already did?

451
00:27:44,526 --> 00:27:47,871
Ga Yeon, you can do it!
Just tuck in your chin.

452
00:27:47,872 --> 00:27:52,310
Don't think about putting your head down,
but tuck in your chin instead.

453
00:27:52,311 --> 00:27:55,254
- Just tuck and roll!
- Why are you trying to coach her?

454
00:27:55,255 --> 00:27:57,757
Why are you coaching her
when she just needs to roll forward?

455
00:27:57,758 --> 00:28:01,117
It's not a difficult task.
You stand in fighting rings.

456
00:28:01,118 --> 00:28:03,209
- Don't worry, you can do this.
- Okay.

457
00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:04,714
Just go for it.

458
00:28:05,184 --> 00:28:07,293
[Ga Yeon, you can do it!]

459
00:28:08,492 --> 00:28:13,958
[At last... she takes the roll!]

460
00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:28,628
[Ga Yeon overcomes her fear and falls in,
and all six have now taken their plunge.]

461
00:28:28,629 --> 00:28:30,648
- You did good.
- Ga Yeon fell in!

462
00:28:30,649 --> 00:28:32,192
[Winter teams, on the other hand...]

463
00:28:36,676 --> 00:28:39,466
[These hearts are still
waiting for their other halves...]

464
00:28:44,298 --> 00:28:46,797
[Form a line!]

465
00:28:48,105 --> 00:28:50,197
Do you think we'll ever get
out of here?

466
00:28:51,086 --> 00:28:53,134
Do you think we can get out of here?

467
00:28:56,613 --> 00:28:58,698
[Gary quickly makes his escape!]

468
00:29:00,075 --> 00:29:02,636
- Pick the right one!
- Wait a minute...

469
00:29:03,651 --> 00:29:07,465
[Checks the approximate
size with his hands.]

470
00:29:08,831 --> 00:29:14,337
[Which one of these numerous halves
is the right one?]

471
00:29:14,338 --> 00:29:19,721
Eight, nine, eight, seven...

472
00:29:19,756 --> 00:29:21,510
[He makes his selection!]

473
00:29:23,557 --> 00:29:26,769
[Please... let it be the right one.]

474
00:29:26,770 --> 00:29:28,670
- It's perfect!
- Is it the right one?

475
00:29:28,671 --> 00:29:31,227
It's perfect!
It's the perfect fit!

476
00:29:31,228 --> 00:29:34,602
[Gary and Soo Jin succeed!]

477
00:29:34,603 --> 00:29:37,928
[First couple to escape the igloo!]

478
00:29:37,929 --> 00:29:39,702
- Get going.
- Go.

479
00:29:39,703 --> 00:29:41,347
You've succeeded the mission.

480
00:29:41,348 --> 00:29:45,231
Choose your next location,
and continue on with the race.

481
00:29:45,232 --> 00:29:47,348
This one?
Or this one?

482
00:29:47,349 --> 00:29:49,543
- This one? This one feels right?
- Yeah.

483
00:29:54,589 --> 00:29:58,851
[Gary and Soo Jin-
Next mission- '100.']

484
00:29:58,852 --> 00:30:01,273
- Bye.
- How can you be so cold hearted?

485
00:30:01,274 --> 00:30:03,949
[Gary and Soo Jin are the first
to leave for their next location.]

486
00:30:06,977 --> 00:30:09,672
- It's 'Crazy.'
- This is how you do it.

487
00:30:09,673 --> 00:30:11,279
[Only two couples left in the igloo.]

488
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:13,845
Wow, you're serious about
your moves!

489
00:30:13,846 --> 00:30:16,043
[It's Sung Kyung's day!]

490
00:30:17,869 --> 00:30:21,000
[Spot on dancing!]

491
00:30:23,291 --> 00:30:24,890
She's really good!

492
00:30:24,891 --> 00:30:27,236
[What a great dancer!]

493
00:30:28,629 --> 00:30:30,745
Her long body looks so pretty.

494
00:30:42,919 --> 00:30:46,063
[Igloo's own dancing queen.]

495
00:30:47,335 --> 00:30:50,078
[Not a single couple has
succeeded the summer mission.]

496
00:30:57,288 --> 00:30:59,916
[Jong Kook succeeds.]

497
00:31:00,672 --> 00:31:02,734
Ugh, I can't even stand looking at him.

498
00:31:02,735 --> 00:31:04,316
- I can't even stand him.
- He's so cool.

499
00:31:04,317 --> 00:31:06,729
[Response to Kkuk is the polar opposite.]

500
00:31:07,528 --> 00:31:10,692
- I think the body has to be kept tight.
- You can do this.

501
00:31:11,156 --> 00:31:13,076
[Grab the ledge of the board,
and tuck in your chin.]

502
00:31:13,077 --> 00:31:15,339
Did you create this game?

503
00:31:16,179 --> 00:31:18,538
Are you the creator of this game?

504
00:31:18,539 --> 00:31:20,612
Ugh, seriously.

505
00:31:23,074 --> 00:31:25,071
[Ga Yeon succeeds her first roll.]

506
00:31:25,072 --> 00:31:27,740
Tuck in your chin tighter!
Okay, there you go.

507
00:31:27,741 --> 00:31:29,782
You can do this!
There's a lot of distance left.

508
00:31:29,783 --> 00:31:32,201
- There's a ton of distance still left.
- She might be able to succeed this time.

509
00:31:36,509 --> 00:31:39,019
What are Goo Roo and So Min doing?

510
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:42,016
[Budding friendship over eye goop.]

511
00:31:42,017 --> 00:31:45,866
- You can do this.
- You got this!

512
00:31:45,867 --> 00:31:52,239
[This time...
she manages to stay on the ledge!]

513
00:31:53,485 --> 00:31:56,659
[Now, they must stand up on the ledge
in order to succeed the mission!]

514
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:58,987
Okay, just stand up now!

515
00:31:58,988 --> 00:32:01,099
- Did we actually do this?
- That's right!

516
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:03,587
One, two, three!

517
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:05,761
[Jong Kook and Ga Yeon succeed.]

518
00:32:06,546 --> 00:32:09,111
[When will it be our turn?]

519
00:32:09,112 --> 00:32:10,724
Wow, I'm so jealous.

520
00:32:12,973 --> 00:32:18,373
[Jong Kook and Ga Yeon's
next mission- '1'.]

521
00:32:18,942 --> 00:32:21,167
[Jae Suk and Goo Roo's turn.]

522
00:32:23,982 --> 00:32:26,130
That's the scariest part.
Your third roll is the scariest.

523
00:32:26,131 --> 00:32:27,992
[It'll soon be my turn.]

524
00:32:29,297 --> 00:32:32,801
[He takes the roll!]

525
00:32:36,592 --> 00:32:39,018
[He maintains the position!]

526
00:32:40,246 --> 00:32:42,449
[Grits down to keep his position!]

527
00:32:45,899 --> 00:32:48,823
He would've fallen in if
he hadn't grabbed onto the sides!

528
00:32:55,164 --> 00:32:57,212
[Jae Suk and Goo Roo succeed.]

529
00:32:57,213 --> 00:32:58,888
[Throws himself in the water.]

530
00:33:00,766 --> 00:33:03,581
[Farewell to the scary diving board.]

531
00:33:05,563 --> 00:33:08,101
[Polar ends of the extreme race-
Time to select their next location.]

532
00:33:08,102 --> 00:33:09,794
You can pick.

533
00:33:09,795 --> 00:33:12,837
[Kwang Soo and So Min
keep rolling and rolling...]

534
00:33:12,838 --> 00:33:15,990
- Show it to the camera.
- 100.

535
00:33:24,747 --> 00:33:28,096
- How did I fall in?
- You looked horrible as you fell in.

536
00:33:28,097 --> 00:33:30,215
You're a gem!

537
00:33:30,216 --> 00:33:31,826
[So Min, the new queen of
slapstick comedy!]

538
00:33:32,801 --> 00:33:37,334
[Who will be the first couple to arrive
at the next mission site?]

539
00:33:38,237 --> 00:33:40,705
[Next mission location for the couples
who chose number one- SBS.]

540
00:33:40,706 --> 00:33:41,960
What's this?

541
00:33:41,961 --> 00:33:44,737
[Jong Kook and Ga Yeon
are first to arrive.]

542
00:33:44,738 --> 00:33:46,995
What's going on here?
Where do we have to go?

543
00:33:46,996 --> 00:33:49,839
[What does the number stand for?]

544
00:33:50,397 --> 00:33:51,939
I think we're the first ones here.

545
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:53,653
[Runs in side by side.]

546
00:33:54,152 --> 00:33:55,773
- You are the first ones to arrive.
- Okay.

547
00:33:55,774 --> 00:33:58,338
Welcome to our 'One' couple.

548
00:33:58,339 --> 00:34:00,153
Your next mission is very simple.

549
00:34:00,154 --> 00:34:02,854
You've made the right selection.
Just need to answer one question correctly.

550
00:34:02,855 --> 00:34:04,511
[Mission-
Correctly answer one quiz question.]

551
00:34:04,512 --> 00:34:06,660
Then will the other couple have to
answer one hundred questions?

552
00:34:06,661 --> 00:34:08,135
I'm not sure.

553
00:34:08,136 --> 00:34:09,782
Listen to the questions asked
by the male partner

554
00:34:09,783 --> 00:34:12,327
and the female partner just needs to
answer it correctly to win.

555
00:34:12,328 --> 00:34:13,741
That's nothing.

556
00:34:13,741 --> 00:34:18,889
The male will be given the question
to ask from here on the first floor...

557
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:23,000
and ask the question to your partner
who will be standing up on the 22nd floor.

558
00:34:23,001 --> 00:34:26,977
It's only one question and very simple.
Answer the question correctly, and you pass.

559
00:34:26,978 --> 00:34:27,997
It's just one question.

560
00:34:27,997 --> 00:34:34,077
Get it wrong, and the male will come
back down for a new question.

561
00:34:34,078 --> 00:34:38,022
Ga Yeon has a competition in December,
so she needs the exercise.

562
00:34:38,023 --> 00:34:40,098
She has to start her
weight loss program tomorrow.

563
00:34:40,099 --> 00:34:42,315
You can start that tomorrow.
Please go up to the 22nd floor.

564
00:34:42,316 --> 00:34:44,948
- Please show her up to the 22nd floor.
- Ga Yeon.

565
00:34:44,949 --> 00:34:48,706
- Are you good at quizzes?
- I'll do my best.

566
00:34:49,268 --> 00:34:51,692
- Ga Yeon, you have to do a good job.
- Okay.

567
00:34:51,693 --> 00:34:53,894
He has to climb up the stairs?

568
00:34:55,182 --> 00:34:57,399
Wow, Running Man is scary.

569
00:34:57,826 --> 00:35:00,176
- Here's your first question.
- Okay.

570
00:35:00,177 --> 00:35:02,865
I'm only going to read it once.
Here's your question.

571
00:35:03,410 --> 00:35:08,225
It's a luminous effect seen in Arctic Circle
and Antarctic Circle through magnetic force

572
00:35:08,226 --> 00:35:12,939
and the word means, 'New Dawn', in Latin.
What is this phenomenon called?

573
00:35:13,574 --> 00:35:19,090
[Must race up 22 flights of stairs
to ask this question.]

574
00:35:20,031 --> 00:35:21,891
It means, 'New Dawn', in Latin...

575
00:35:21,892 --> 00:35:24,679
She's not going to know that!

576
00:35:25,518 --> 00:35:30,972
Through the earth's magnetic field force...

577
00:35:32,451 --> 00:35:36,708
[Climb up the stairs
while memorizing the question.]

578
00:35:36,709 --> 00:35:39,456
A luminous effect...

579
00:35:39,457 --> 00:35:40,915
[Answer the question correctly
to immediately pass the mission.]

580
00:35:40,916 --> 00:35:44,264
Sun... earth...
what was it again?

581
00:35:44,265 --> 00:35:46,907
I mean, earth's magnetic force.
I'm only on the fourth floor?

582
00:35:46,908 --> 00:35:49,877
[Only on the fourth floor,
and already forgetting the question.]

583
00:35:50,695 --> 00:35:52,062
Through the earth's magnetic field force...

584
00:35:52,063 --> 00:35:54,481
Earth's magnetic force...
Ugh, I'm so hot.

585
00:35:54,921 --> 00:36:01,766
[His partner is...
way up on the 22nd floor!]

586
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:06,264
[Come on, Jong Kook.]

587
00:36:07,084 --> 00:36:08,994
Just think of it as exercise.
It's just exercise!

588
00:36:08,995 --> 00:36:10,605
This is just some exercise.

589
00:36:10,606 --> 00:36:12,572
Through the earth's magnetic
field force...

590
00:36:14,283 --> 00:36:16,140
Through the earth's magnetic field force...

591
00:36:18,014 --> 00:36:19,867
Through the earth's magnetic field force...

592
00:36:19,868 --> 00:36:21,485
Ugh, I forgot the question!

593
00:36:22,086 --> 00:36:24,946
[He's only halfway there...]

594
00:36:26,431 --> 00:36:30,666
They look so at ease while they run in here
without knowing what's in store for them.

595
00:36:30,667 --> 00:36:33,055
[Suk Jin, Ji Hyo and Ha Ha, Sung Kyung
are on the first floor.]

596
00:36:33,056 --> 00:36:35,215
Welcome to our 'One' couple.

597
00:36:35,216 --> 00:36:38,179
You just need to correctly
answer one quiz question.

598
00:36:41,113 --> 00:36:42,689
The rules are very simple.

599
00:36:43,415 --> 00:36:47,111
[Finish listening to the rules
before you get too excited.]

600
00:36:47,112 --> 00:36:50,905
[A one question quiz is nothing
to get excited about.]

601
00:36:51,527 --> 00:36:54,012
Ask the question to you partner,
who will be waiting on the 22nd floor.

602
00:36:54,452 --> 00:36:56,689
[Stay strong, Suk Jin.]

603
00:36:57,310 --> 00:36:58,996
Here's your question.

604
00:36:59,713 --> 00:37:04,126
In the Antarctic circle, there exists
a base station called, King Sejong Station.

605
00:37:04,421 --> 00:37:06,914
- Yes, that's correct.
- In that case...

606
00:37:06,915 --> 00:37:09,718
- On the opposite side of the Antarctic...
- In the Arctic?

607
00:37:09,719 --> 00:37:13,359
What is the name of the base station
in the arctic circle?

608
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:14,815
You may get going.

609
00:37:14,816 --> 00:37:17,385
Wow, even I don't know this one.
Is there a base station there?

610
00:37:17,386 --> 00:37:19,009
There isn't one, is there?

611
00:37:20,967 --> 00:37:23,714
'Taking the stairs will make you
healthier and slimmer.'

612
00:37:24,789 --> 00:37:27,806
It says that taking each stair
will increase your life by four seconds!

613
00:37:27,807 --> 00:37:30,437
It increases your lifespan by four seconds?

614
00:37:32,607 --> 00:37:34,819
Wow, wait a second...
That's not bad.

615
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:36,373
It's doable.

616
00:37:39,417 --> 00:37:43,085
One, two, three... nine.

617
00:37:43,086 --> 00:37:45,142
Nine times four is 36.
36 seconds.

618
00:37:46,063 --> 00:37:48,085
Wow, this is good.

619
00:37:49,481 --> 00:37:54,527
Taking two flights of stairs will help lose
8.9kcal for male and 6.3kcal for female...

620
00:37:56,883 --> 00:38:00,457
I've increased my lifespan
by five minutes.

621
00:38:00,458 --> 00:38:02,032
This isn't bad.

622
00:38:02,768 --> 00:38:04,688
Wait...

623
00:38:04,689 --> 00:38:06,661
What was the question again?

624
00:38:06,662 --> 00:38:09,503
I think I may have forgotten
the question.

625
00:38:09,504 --> 00:38:11,612
In the Antarctic...

626
00:38:11,613 --> 00:38:14,188
[What was it about the Antarctic?]

627
00:38:14,189 --> 00:38:16,438
[What am I going to do?]

628
00:38:19,591 --> 00:38:22,462
[Number 100's mission-
A cafe in Hongdae.]

629
00:38:22,463 --> 00:38:25,027
[Gary and Soo Jin
are the first ones to arrive.]

630
00:38:25,028 --> 00:38:26,641
Soo Jin.

631
00:38:26,642 --> 00:38:29,641
Here's your mission for
having chosen one hundred.

632
00:38:29,642 --> 00:38:34,139
You next mission is to score
100 goals within 100 seconds.

633
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:36,837
[Score 100 points within 100 seconds.]

634
00:38:36,838 --> 00:38:38,305
Do you see the basket up above?

635
00:38:38,889 --> 00:38:42,765
The women and the men will play
separate games of basketball

636
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,942
and the first team to score
100 points will win the mission.

637
00:38:48,277 --> 00:38:51,200
[Kwang Soo and So Min arrive
soon thereafter.]

638
00:38:51,201 --> 00:38:53,611
- What is this?
- It's all over.

639
00:38:53,897 --> 00:38:57,957
[Surprised at seeing the basketball goal
setup atop the trampoline.]

640
00:38:57,958 --> 00:38:59,833
This is ridiculous!
This is too hard!

641
00:38:59,834 --> 00:39:01,211
Okay, let's warm up!

642
00:39:01,212 --> 00:39:03,339
[Jae Suk and Goo Roo start their
warmup exercise upon arrival.]

643
00:39:05,355 --> 00:39:07,957
[Trampoline 100 point basketball game-
First round goes to the women.]

644
00:39:07,958 --> 00:39:09,903
- You have to do this.
- Okay.

645
00:39:09,904 --> 00:39:12,771
[The three women showed how tough
they can be at the previous mission.]

646
00:39:12,772 --> 00:39:14,964
Goo Roo, use your elbow
once in a while.

647
00:39:14,965 --> 00:39:17,148
[The men are teaching them
how to cheat.]

648
00:39:17,149 --> 00:39:19,686
I'm the oldest one here,
so don't even think about it.

649
00:39:19,687 --> 00:39:22,942
[So Min is asserting her seniority.]

650
00:39:22,943 --> 00:39:25,602
- Jeon So Min, what are you doing?
- Don't even come close to me.

651
00:39:25,603 --> 00:39:29,073
So Min, I'm still too young
to really care about any of that.

652
00:39:29,074 --> 00:39:30,462
Just show everyone what
you're made of.

653
00:39:30,463 --> 00:39:32,281
- Right, Gary?
- Of course.

654
00:39:32,282 --> 00:39:34,024
[These women are not to be
taken lightly!]

655
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:37,527
- Jeon So Min, fighting!
- Ready!

656
00:39:37,528 --> 00:39:39,758
[100 point basketball-
Start round one.]

657
00:39:39,759 --> 00:39:42,550
Oh my, Goo Roo!

658
00:39:43,818 --> 00:39:45,496
[So Min does a victory dance
after scoring her first goal.]

659
00:39:45,497 --> 00:39:47,824
Stop wasting time with a victory dance!

660
00:39:47,825 --> 00:39:50,185
[Ten seconds of victory dance
after scoring one goal.]

661
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:56,422
[The three women keep shooting
without any break in between.]

662
00:39:57,302 --> 00:39:59,077
- Goo Roo!
- Yes?

663
00:39:59,078 --> 00:40:02,127
- Score something!
- Please be quiet!

664
00:40:07,044 --> 00:40:10,469
[Goo Roo makes her first goal.]

665
00:40:10,470 --> 00:40:12,651
Han Goo Roo made a goal.

666
00:40:13,206 --> 00:40:15,948
[Soo Jin immediately follows
with her very first goal.]

667
00:40:16,985 --> 00:40:20,165
[Soo Jin makes single-handed
throws like the men.]

668
00:40:20,166 --> 00:40:23,449
[And makes her second goal in a row.]

669
00:40:25,902 --> 00:40:28,077
Goo Roo, what are you doing?

670
00:40:31,721 --> 00:40:33,891
[So Min also makes her second goal.]

671
00:40:33,892 --> 00:40:35,961
[Follows with another victory lap.]

672
00:40:35,962 --> 00:40:38,730
Knock it off with the victory lap!

673
00:40:39,603 --> 00:40:42,130
- Just make the goals!
- Soo Jin and So Min each have two goals.

674
00:40:42,131 --> 00:40:45,562
[Wow, So Min makes another goal!]

675
00:40:45,563 --> 00:40:49,109
Just go back and score another one!
I'll high-five you all you want later!

676
00:40:49,110 --> 00:40:50,587
Goo Roo!

677
00:40:53,142 --> 00:40:55,732
[Soo Jin makes her third goal.]

678
00:40:59,603 --> 00:41:02,107
[Soo Jin is in the lead with four goals.]

679
00:41:02,108 --> 00:41:04,257
[Soo Jin's impressive shooting posture.]

680
00:41:04,258 --> 00:41:06,553
- You have to stop Soo Jin!
- I'm so tired!

681
00:41:07,276 --> 00:41:12,067
[Even in the midst of the physical tussle...
Remains her composure, shoots, and scores!]

682
00:41:12,484 --> 00:41:14,808
[Soo Jin's unending scores.]

683
00:41:16,723 --> 00:41:21,113
[Makes every shot she throws!
This is Soo Jin's shining moment!]

684
00:41:21,114 --> 00:41:23,448
You have to stop Soo Jin!

685
00:41:23,892 --> 00:41:26,494
[Goo Roo attacks So Min.]

686
00:41:26,495 --> 00:41:30,174
- No, you have to stop Soo Jin!
- She has the wrong person!

687
00:41:30,175 --> 00:41:31,859
You have to stop Soo Jin!

688
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:33,391
[Goo Roo, immediately switched
her target.]

689
00:41:34,122 --> 00:41:37,064
[Goo Roo's new goal is to stop Soo Jin
instead of taking the shots herself.]

690
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:45,101
[So Min's sole chance.]

691
00:41:46,004 --> 00:41:48,230
We have to stop her!

692
00:41:50,678 --> 00:41:53,281
[This time, Goo Roo clings
onto So Min.]

693
00:41:53,282 --> 00:41:55,313
What are you doing, Goo Roo!

694
00:41:57,394 --> 00:42:00,650
[Soo Jin doesn't miss her chance,
and grabs a ball in each hand to shoot!]

695
00:42:05,470 --> 00:42:08,240
[Competitive Soo Jin still throws off a shot
even as she takes a tumble.]

696
00:42:08,241 --> 00:42:11,495
[A fierce physical battle
atop the trampoline.]

697
00:42:14,585 --> 00:42:19,434
[Soo Jin still attempts to make a shot
even in the midst of the tussle.]

698
00:42:20,818 --> 00:42:22,628
Come on!

699
00:42:24,189 --> 00:42:26,634
[Time out]

700
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:30,530
- What are you girls doing?
- It's over!

701
00:42:31,786 --> 00:42:35,054
[Scores 60 points on her own.
Soo Jin shows alarmingly good skills.]

702
00:42:35,055 --> 00:42:38,739
[The battle was fierce enough
to take off one of her socks.]

703
00:42:39,979 --> 00:42:41,741
Sorry, girls.

704
00:42:42,607 --> 00:42:44,907
[These girls are way too scary.]

705
00:42:48,636 --> 00:42:50,559
[Meanwhile...]

706
00:42:51,271 --> 00:42:53,744
[Kkuk is still climbing up
his 22 flights of stairs.]

707
00:42:55,203 --> 00:42:57,019
Don't your thighs feel like
they're about to burst?

708
00:42:57,020 --> 00:42:59,120
The luminous effect in the arctic...

709
00:42:59,525 --> 00:43:03,642
[Repeating the question to himself
in case he forgets the question.]

710
00:43:04,447 --> 00:43:07,317
[The staff members are still
on the 19th floor.]

711
00:43:08,934 --> 00:43:13,172
[Kkuk arrives on the 22nd floor.]

712
00:43:16,212 --> 00:43:20,112
[Did he memorize the question correctly?]

713
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:23,280
Is he here?

714
00:43:31,670 --> 00:43:33,666
Oh my goodness...

715
00:43:33,667 --> 00:43:35,591
[Wow, he really climbed all
the way up here.]

716
00:43:36,432 --> 00:43:40,867
Kim Jong Kook can't cross the finish line,
and Ga Yeon must stand on her spot.

717
00:43:43,326 --> 00:43:46,990
Ga Yeon...
What took you guys so long?

718
00:43:46,991 --> 00:43:50,567
[VJ drops falls down to the ground
along with the camera.]

719
00:43:50,568 --> 00:43:52,027
- The question is...
- Yes?

720
00:43:52,028 --> 00:43:55,573
It's a very long question.
The question is...

721
00:43:56,659 --> 00:43:59,461
The word means, 'New Dawn', in Latin.

722
00:44:00,387 --> 00:44:02,859
- In Latin...
- 'New Dawn' in Latin?

723
00:44:02,860 --> 00:44:04,173
Okay.

724
00:44:04,174 --> 00:44:07,782
But it's some sort of a phenomenon.
The heat of the sun.

725
00:44:07,783 --> 00:44:10,606
- The earth's rotation.
- Rotation?

726
00:44:10,607 --> 00:44:13,399
The light illuminates because
of those two.

727
00:44:14,031 --> 00:44:16,214
Did you know the answer
when you heard the question?

728
00:44:16,736 --> 00:44:18,659
Why are you asking me that?

729
00:44:18,660 --> 00:44:21,203
This is for you to answer, Ga Yeon.

730
00:44:21,204 --> 00:44:24,323
- You have to answer the question.
- You don't know the answer either?

731
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:28,791
I came up here to ask you
the question.

732
00:44:28,891 --> 00:44:31,172
[Correct answer- Aurora.]

733
00:44:32,481 --> 00:44:35,059
[Kkuk must go back down to the first floor
to receive a new question.]

734
00:44:35,060 --> 00:44:36,996
My thighs feel like they're
about to burst.

735
00:44:37,772 --> 00:44:40,580
[Two more people whose thighs are about
to burst are coming up the stairs.]

736
00:44:40,581 --> 00:44:46,670
[Which of the Running Man members
has an A blood type?]

737
00:44:46,671 --> 00:44:49,503
[Ha Ha and Big-nose meet up
on the eleventh floor.]

738
00:44:51,459 --> 00:44:56,223
Our writers...
I don't even know the question.

739
00:44:56,224 --> 00:44:57,399
[These two are on the verge of passing out.]

740
00:44:57,400 --> 00:45:01,323
The first person to get the answer
correct will have the advantage.

741
00:45:04,693 --> 00:45:06,807
Does Kwang Soo have AB blood type?

742
00:45:07,571 --> 00:45:11,105
[Finally arrives on the 22nd floor.]

743
00:45:12,765 --> 00:45:15,175
[Ha Ha's here!]

744
00:45:16,199 --> 00:45:18,698
Is it a hard question?

745
00:45:18,699 --> 00:45:21,867
- How have you been?
- Is it a tough question?

746
00:45:22,583 --> 00:45:26,164
[I know that Suk Jin left first...]

747
00:45:26,165 --> 00:45:30,423
- Ha Ha, have you seen Suk Jin?
- Suk Jin's sleeping on the 15th floor.

748
00:45:32,284 --> 00:45:35,734
[Where is the end?]

749
00:45:35,735 --> 00:45:37,614
Give me the question.

750
00:45:39,549 --> 00:45:41,770
- Here's your first question.
- My first question?

751
00:45:41,771 --> 00:45:44,666
If you fail to answer this
question correctly

752
00:45:44,667 --> 00:45:47,098
then I have to go back down
and come all the way back up again.

753
00:45:47,099 --> 00:45:49,424
Suk Jin!
There's Suk Jin!

754
00:45:49,799 --> 00:45:52,211
[Big-nose finally arrives!]

755
00:45:53,772 --> 00:45:56,458
- Suk Jin!
- I'm not walking like this on purpose.

756
00:45:56,885 --> 00:45:59,677
I'm going to kill you
if you don't get this right.

757
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:04,408
[Jong Kook is already back!]

758
00:46:04,409 --> 00:46:06,214
He's back already?

759
00:46:06,215 --> 00:46:10,929
[Kkuk came back at top speed
by the use of Mr. Capable's powers.]

760
00:46:11,432 --> 00:46:12,626
This is my second trip.

761
00:46:12,627 --> 00:46:15,970
Guys, a whole new world opens up
on your second trip back up.

762
00:46:16,775 --> 00:46:19,304
- I wonder what kind of a world it could be.
- Who could it be?

763
00:46:19,305 --> 00:46:22,979
[Albeit an unknown world,
it's a world I never want to know about.]

764
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:25,019
Out of all the Running Man members...

765
00:46:26,059 --> 00:46:29,090
which one of us has an A blood type?

766
00:46:31,657 --> 00:46:34,553
- Wow.
- Think carefully about our personalities.

767
00:46:35,007 --> 00:46:39,154
A blood type is more reserved.
Probably not an extrovert like me.

768
00:46:39,155 --> 00:46:44,265
Not so bothersome like Jae Suk,
or anything else like that.

769
00:46:44,563 --> 00:46:49,679
[Please... Get it right...]

770
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:52,104
- One.
- Kim Jong Kook!

771
00:46:56,659 --> 00:47:00,002
You have to go back down.
[Answer- Jong Kook, Gary, and Ji Hyo.]

772
00:47:00,003 --> 00:47:02,792
- Okay, who's next?
- Wait.

773
00:47:03,425 --> 00:47:06,384
- She was about to say more.
- But the time's already up.

774
00:47:06,385 --> 00:47:09,123
[Ha Ha, back to the first floor.]

775
00:47:09,594 --> 00:47:12,194
Dong Hoon, think of it as
getting exercise.

776
00:47:12,195 --> 00:47:13,914
Just get back down there.

777
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:17,660
Wait, I want to see
Song Ji Hyo's reaction first.

778
00:47:18,510 --> 00:47:20,042
Ji Hyo.

779
00:47:20,043 --> 00:47:21,641
You're smart, aren't you?

780
00:47:22,174 --> 00:47:24,918
- Why? What's the question?
- I'm going to ask you something.

781
00:47:24,919 --> 00:47:28,760
- Ji Hyo, I'm seriously about to lose it.
- What is it?

782
00:47:28,795 --> 00:47:31,377
I've never climbed 22 flights
of stairs in all my life.

783
00:47:31,412 --> 00:47:34,566
- You need to work out more, Suk Jin.
- Seriously.

784
00:47:34,567 --> 00:47:37,806
- Listen carefully to my question.
- Would I know the answer to it?

785
00:47:37,807 --> 00:47:40,672
- Yes, you'd know. Here's the first one.
- My first?

786
00:47:40,673 --> 00:47:42,873
Are you planning on asking me
a second question?

787
00:47:42,874 --> 00:47:45,730
[Why would you ask
such a frightful thing as that?]

788
00:47:46,509 --> 00:47:48,190
I'm only going to ask one question.

789
00:47:48,635 --> 00:47:51,930
Okay, there's a base station in
the Antarctic circle.

790
00:47:51,931 --> 00:47:55,083
- Antarctic station.
- Yes, what's the name of it?

791
00:47:55,084 --> 00:47:56,764
Antarctic station.

792
00:47:56,765 --> 00:47:59,103
- No, it's King Sejong Station.
- Ah, King Sejong Station?

793
00:47:59,815 --> 00:48:02,708
- There's more.
- Suk Jin, let's just go.

794
00:48:03,464 --> 00:48:05,219
- Let's just go.
- Just go!

795
00:48:05,220 --> 00:48:08,208
- Are you getting the question?
- Suk Jin's getting mad.

796
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:11,919
So, what's the name of the base station
in the arctic circle?

797
00:48:12,826 --> 00:48:15,215
I'm telling you that it's not
the arctic base station.

798
00:48:17,098 --> 00:48:19,536
[If the Antarctic station is
King Sejong Station, then in the arctic...]

799
00:48:19,537 --> 00:48:23,222
Lee Soon Shin Station!

800
00:48:25,780 --> 00:48:28,836
What is it?
The other was King Sejong Station.

801
00:48:28,837 --> 00:48:31,074
I don't know the answer either!

802
00:48:31,075 --> 00:48:35,013
- You don't know either?
- How would I know the answer?

803
00:48:35,430 --> 00:48:38,636
Because there's King Sejong and
General Lee Soon Shin at Gwanghwamun Gate.

804
00:48:38,637 --> 00:48:41,649
What does that have to do with this!
This is about the arctic circle!

805
00:48:42,307 --> 00:48:44,657
Why are you talking about
Gwanghwamun Gate?

806
00:48:45,939 --> 00:48:49,439
Seriously!
Why is this hot pack so hot!

807
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:50,942
Taking his anger out on the hot pack.

808
00:48:51,233 --> 00:48:53,268
[Suk Jin must head back down
to the first floor.]

809
00:48:56,527 --> 00:48:59,326
- Goo Roo! Can you start the groove?
- What?

810
00:48:59,327 --> 00:49:02,500
Give us a wave.
There you go!

811
00:49:02,501 --> 00:49:04,752
[Goo Roo's waving cheer.]

812
00:49:04,753 --> 00:49:07,013
That's what we need!
Why didn't you do that sooner?

813
00:49:07,014 --> 00:49:09,163
- What are you waiting for, Soo Jin?
- So Min, it's your turn!

814
00:49:09,164 --> 00:49:10,647
What are you waiting for!

815
00:49:13,422 --> 00:49:16,016
[Truly a unique character.]

816
00:49:16,274 --> 00:49:20,235
- Namyangju!
- What are you talking about!

817
00:49:20,236 --> 00:49:23,622
I've moved!
I'm living with someone!

818
00:49:23,623 --> 00:49:25,688
What?
You're living with someone?

819
00:49:25,689 --> 00:49:27,903
- Who are you living with?
- What are you saying?

820
00:49:27,904 --> 00:49:30,361
- Hey, you're living with someone?
- No!

821
00:49:30,362 --> 00:49:33,209
- You didn't tell me anything about that!
- No, I'm not living with anyone.

822
00:49:38,262 --> 00:49:46,022
[Such a long road to travel...
for a short incorrect answer.]

823
00:49:46,931 --> 00:49:50,107
[Ha Ha arrives on the 22nd floor
for the second time.]

824
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:53,702
[Ha Ha's back!]

825
00:49:53,703 --> 00:49:56,058
Give me the question.

826
00:49:56,375 --> 00:49:58,132
This question...

827
00:49:58,133 --> 00:50:00,158
I know you're going to get.

828
00:50:01,932 --> 00:50:03,147
- I guarantee it.
- Okay.

829
00:50:03,148 --> 00:50:06,464
Everyone who walks in through that door
has the same expression on their face.

830
00:50:06,465 --> 00:50:08,352
They walk the same, too.

831
00:50:08,353 --> 00:50:11,072
[Try taking the stairs, and you'll know.]

832
00:50:11,073 --> 00:50:13,716
Suk Jin!
Suk Jin, you're back!

833
00:50:13,717 --> 00:50:16,308
[Big-nose is also back.]

834
00:50:16,420 --> 00:50:18,095
Okay.

835
00:50:18,096 --> 00:50:21,149
It's the opposite word.
Just think of the opposite.

836
00:50:21,150 --> 00:50:23,651
- Yes, I understand.
- Think of the opposite word.

837
00:50:25,845 --> 00:50:29,375
- It's the opposite of what I'm about to say.
- Just say it already!

838
00:50:29,814 --> 00:50:32,988
- How many times must you repeat yourself?
- I'm trying to explain it to her!

839
00:50:32,989 --> 00:50:34,699
We have to take our turn, too.

840
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:41,294
Incheon coastal waters.

841
00:50:41,295 --> 00:50:45,683
[What's the opposite word of
'Incheon coastal waters'?]

842
00:50:45,684 --> 00:50:48,779
- Yen, nine...
- 'Incheon mother'? (Word play)

843
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:51,529
[Could this be the correct answer?]

844
00:50:51,530 --> 00:50:53,537
Answer.
Incheon mother?

845
00:50:54,918 --> 00:50:57,366
[Correct answer]

846
00:50:58,304 --> 00:51:02,228
[Jong Kook and Ga Yeon
succeed the quiz mission.]

847
00:51:02,229 --> 00:51:04,244
You did great!

848
00:51:04,245 --> 00:51:07,300
[A question that utilized the phonetic
sound of 'Incheon coastal waters.']

849
00:51:07,301 --> 00:51:10,545
[Ga Yeon was quick witted enough
to have figured that out!]

850
00:51:10,546 --> 00:51:12,351
But you got the feel for it, right?

851
00:51:12,352 --> 00:51:14,083
[Jong Kook and Ga Yeon are
first to succeed.]

852
00:51:14,084 --> 00:51:16,963
- Wow, she's so smart.
- That was hard.

853
00:51:16,964 --> 00:51:18,889
- I had no idea.
- You didn't know, right?

854
00:51:20,309 --> 00:51:24,031
She's very smart.
I didn't know the answer either.

855
00:51:24,032 --> 00:51:25,860
[So envious...]

856
00:51:28,294 --> 00:51:32,105
[Jong Kook and Ga Yeon select
the next mission location.]

857
00:51:33,015 --> 00:51:35,588
[Immediately off to the next location!]

858
00:51:35,589 --> 00:51:38,239
- Fighting, Jae Suk!
- You can do this!

859
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:40,513
Kwang Soo!

860
00:51:40,514 --> 00:51:44,215
[A total score of 100 points.
Last chance of their second round.]

861
00:51:45,171 --> 00:51:48,878
[Kwang Soo vs Jae Suk. Fierce
battle between the two ace players.]

862
00:51:54,082 --> 00:51:56,691
[Thanks to their battle,
Gary now takes the lead.]

863
00:51:58,046 --> 00:52:00,528
[Jae Suk and Kwang Soo forget the
mission and start to wrestle instead.]

864
00:52:00,529 --> 00:52:03,615
[Forcefully tries to remove
Jae Suk's pants.]

865
00:52:05,278 --> 00:52:08,236
[Thank goodness for his long johns!]

866
00:52:10,857 --> 00:52:13,183
[Gary seizes his chance and
scores another goal!]

867
00:52:13,534 --> 00:52:17,923
[Others might think that this mission is
about taking off their pants.]

868
00:52:20,158 --> 00:52:22,346
Take off Gary's pants, too.

869
00:52:22,347 --> 00:52:25,082
No, you can't!
I only have my underwear on!

870
00:52:25,466 --> 00:52:28,650
[No, I only have my underwear on!]

871
00:52:35,611 --> 00:52:39,222
[The time runs out with all their pants
around their ankles.]

872
00:52:40,470 --> 00:52:44,222
[A close call in such unexpected ways.]

873
00:52:44,223 --> 00:52:46,746
I'm sorry, you didn't
have your long johns on?

874
00:52:48,939 --> 00:52:51,121
They're taking pictures up there.

875
00:52:51,585 --> 00:52:53,983
- Long johns counts as pants?
- Of course.

876
00:52:56,165 --> 00:53:01,434
[As long as they're feeling confident,
long johns can be fashionable, too!]

877
00:53:01,435 --> 00:53:03,646
Please put your pants back on.

878
00:53:03,647 --> 00:53:05,802
- Sorry, Gary.
- It's okay.

879
00:53:05,803 --> 00:53:08,215
- I had no idea you only had your undies on.
- It's okay.

880
00:53:08,216 --> 00:53:11,967
Okay, here are the final results.

881
00:53:12,409 --> 00:53:15,637
Han Goo Roo and Yoo Jae Suk-
three goals.

882
00:53:15,638 --> 00:53:17,133

883
00:53:17,134 --> 00:53:20,614

886
00:53:26,933 --> 00:53:29,295
[Gary and Soo Jin, wins!]

887
00:53:30,176 --> 00:53:33,897
[Ha Ha's on his third attempt.]

888
00:53:36,759 --> 00:53:39,162
[Ha Ha, please succeed this time.]

889
00:53:43,966 --> 00:53:46,609
You look like you just washed your hair.

890
00:53:49,733 --> 00:53:53,597
Oh, no!
What if it's another hard question!

891
00:53:55,589 --> 00:53:57,771
Can I ask while lying down?

892
00:53:59,937 --> 00:54:02,559
Come here, Sung Kyung.

893
00:54:03,943 --> 00:54:05,269
You can't cross the flag line.

894
00:54:05,953 --> 00:54:08,692
- Just relax...
- Rest a bit first.

895
00:54:08,693 --> 00:54:13,796
- Don't let me burden you.
- Ha Ha, did you see Suk Jin on your way?

896
00:54:14,890 --> 00:54:17,648
He passed away on the seventh floor.

897
00:54:20,663 --> 00:54:23,900
[Mom, I miss you...]

898
00:54:24,819 --> 00:54:27,725
What's the name of the base station
in the Antarctic circle?

899
00:54:27,726 --> 00:54:29,333
- King Sejong Station.
- There you go.

900
00:54:29,334 --> 00:54:31,006
[It's the same question!]

901
00:54:31,007 --> 00:54:33,337
Then what's the name of the base
station in the arctic circle?

902
00:54:35,396 --> 00:54:37,395
- Option one.
- Yes?

903
00:54:37,396 --> 00:54:38,403
[Thank goodness,
it's a multiple choice question!]

904
00:54:38,404 --> 00:54:40,221
Yulkok Station.

905
00:54:43,025 --> 00:54:44,853
Option two.

906
00:54:46,687 --> 00:54:48,634

907
00:54:50,665 --> 00:54:52,200
Option three!

Tasan Station.

909
00:54:59,569 --> 00:55:02,314
Tell us the correct answer
by the number.

910
00:55:03,696 --> 00:55:06,744
- Number on, Yulkok Station.
- I'm going to get angry if you get it wrong.

911
00:55:07,110 --> 00:55:09,910
You may go back to your spot.
The correct answer is...

912
00:55:09,911 --> 00:55:13,299
[Please...]

913
00:55:14,190 --> 00:55:17,029
[Wrong]

914
00:55:20,466 --> 00:55:22,106
Sorry, but can you move
out of the way?

915
00:55:25,838 --> 00:55:28,478
- Ji Hyo.
- I'm still in shock.

916
00:55:28,479 --> 00:55:29,887
[Suk Jin and Ji Hyo's turn.]

917
00:55:30,700 --> 00:55:32,957
It's the exact same question.

918
00:55:32,958 --> 00:55:35,338
- Okay?
- As the one he just asked?

919
00:55:35,339 --> 00:55:38,564
Yes, after having heard it,
it's the exact same question.

920
00:55:38,565 --> 00:55:39,929
[Third time this is being asked of Blank Ji.]

921
00:55:41,257 --> 00:55:43,857
It's the same question.
Number one, Yulkok Station.

922
00:55:43,858 --> 00:55:47,777
Two, Tosan Station,
and Three, Tasan Station.

923
00:55:47,778 --> 00:55:50,963
[Big-nose hints at
the answer being option two.]

924
00:55:50,964 --> 00:55:53,466
- Answer by giving me the number.
- I'm not sure of the answer.

925
00:55:53,467 --> 00:55:58,371
[It's either option two or three.]

926
00:55:58,372 --> 00:56:02,303
The correct answer is?
One, two, three.

927
00:56:02,304 --> 00:56:04,461
- Number three.
- I told you that it's two.

928
00:56:05,107 --> 00:56:07,422
- What was option three again?
- Tasan Station.

929
00:56:08,033 --> 00:56:09,133
Tasan Station.

930
00:56:09,133 --> 00:56:11,085
Are you confusing it with
Tasan Call Station?

931
00:56:11,087 --> 00:56:15,827
- No, I'm not.
- I think it is. He thinks it's Tasan.

932
00:56:17,787 --> 00:56:19,623
Get away from me!

933
00:56:20,869 --> 00:56:24,192
- I told you that I was right!
- Ji Hyo!

934
00:56:24,193 --> 00:56:27,151
[Hurray, Song Ji Hyo!]

935
00:56:29,354 --> 00:56:33,079
- You have to meet the right woman.
- What kind of a hint was that?

936
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:34,443
[Back down the stairs...]

937
00:56:36,395 --> 00:56:37,774
Are we here?

938
00:56:41,939 --> 00:56:46,555
[Having come in at first place,
Gary and Soo Jin are first to arrive.]

939
00:56:48,967 --> 00:56:51,466
[Is this the final mission location?]

940
00:56:51,467 --> 00:56:53,504
You are the first ones to arrive.

941
00:56:53,505 --> 00:56:56,334
I will now give you a new
address to find for the final mission.

942
00:56:56,796 --> 00:56:58,926
[A new address?]

943
00:56:58,927 --> 00:57:00,522
What is this?

944
00:57:00,523 --> 00:57:05,357
You must go and find the location
where the 'R' marked flag is located.

945
00:57:05,358 --> 00:57:10,105
- You have to go there on foot.
- Do we win once we find the right location?

946
00:57:10,106 --> 00:57:12,673
You may get started.

947
00:57:13,155 --> 00:57:16,835
[Gets on the way without
any set plans.]

948
00:57:16,836 --> 00:57:19,474
Sir, can you tell us where Sim-gok-ro is?

949
00:57:19,475 --> 00:57:22,493
- Sim-gok-ro? It's right down there.
- Down this way?

950
00:57:22,494 --> 00:57:25,065
- Sim-gok-ro.
- Okay, let's go down there.

951
00:57:25,066 --> 00:57:27,537
[Figures out the rough
whereabouts of the location.]

952
00:57:27,538 --> 00:57:29,945
We're in second place!
We still came in at second place.

953
00:57:29,946 --> 00:57:31,795
[Kwang Soo and So Min
arrive in second place.]

954
00:57:31,796 --> 00:57:33,778
Do we just get going with
these addresses?

955
00:57:33,779 --> 00:57:35,421
- Yes.
- But why are we here?

956
00:57:36,291 --> 00:57:38,692
Incheon metro Sim-gok-ro...
it really is an address.

957
00:57:38,693 --> 00:57:40,784
[Kwang Soo and So Min
receive the same address!]

958
00:57:40,785 --> 00:57:42,986
- Do we just go...
- Should we get going?

959
00:57:43,355 --> 00:57:46,080
Sim-gok-ro, road 100...

960
00:57:46,081 --> 00:57:48,529
Sim-gok-ro?

961
00:57:50,178 --> 00:57:52,288
Hey, it says 'Sim-gok-ro' over there!

962
00:57:52,289 --> 00:57:56,316
- You're right, Gary!
- We have to go down to the left.

963
00:57:56,317 --> 00:58:00,154
[Following the road number may
make it easier to find.]

964
00:58:00,155 --> 00:58:02,028
We have to go down more.

965
00:58:02,029 --> 00:58:04,485
- Sim-gok-ro!
- We may find this pretty quickly!

966
00:58:04,826 --> 00:58:07,736
Hello, can you tell us where
Sim-gok-ro is?

967
00:58:08,359 --> 00:58:11,449
- Sim-gok-ro, where?
- Sim-gok-ro, road 100.

968
00:58:13,147 --> 00:58:16,304
- This is...
- This says, Tagok-ro.

969
00:58:16,305 --> 00:58:18,230
- Sim-gok-ro!
- It's Sim-gok-ro!

970
00:58:18,231 --> 00:58:19,982
[Finds Sim-gok-ro by pure chance!]

971
00:58:21,530 --> 00:58:24,824
If we go down further,
we should be able to find 100.

972
00:58:26,721 --> 00:58:28,776
- Look at the address.
- That's 136.

973
00:58:28,777 --> 00:58:30,421
- We have to go down further.
- Nice spotting.

974
00:58:30,422 --> 00:58:32,537
- We're doing good.
- Let's keep going this way.

975
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:35,903
- It's Kim Jong Kook!
- Hi!

976
00:58:39,713 --> 00:58:45,654
[By the use of street signs, the members
are closing in on the location.]

977
00:58:45,655 --> 00:58:48,582
Going by the street address
is pretty easy.

978
00:58:48,583 --> 00:58:51,050
- It's much easier.
- It's definitely easier.

979
00:58:51,051 --> 00:58:53,693
- Where are the other signs?
- Have you guys seen other RM members?

980
00:58:53,694 --> 00:58:55,292
- Yes, we have.
- Where?

981
00:58:55,293 --> 00:58:57,884
- Where are they?
- They're down that way.

982
00:58:57,885 --> 00:58:59,710
[Haroro is following
other RM members tracks.]

983
00:59:01,605 --> 00:59:04,503
[Must find the correct location
with just the street address.]

984
00:59:07,297 --> 00:59:08,717
Road 100!

985
00:59:08,718 --> 00:59:11,349
[The first couple to arrive at the site
will have the best chances of winning!]

986
00:59:11,937 --> 00:59:14,395
[Must hurry over to the final location!]

987
00:59:15,104 --> 00:59:17,871
- 30! That's 30!
- Where?

988
00:59:17,872 --> 00:59:19,422
- Where is it written?
- Over there.

989
00:59:19,423 --> 00:59:25,357
[If that's 30 of road 100,
then right across the street...]

990
00:59:26,199 --> 00:59:31,441
[Gary and Soo Jin are first
to arrive at the final location!]

991
00:59:35,190 --> 00:59:38,274
[In a few moments...]

992
00:59:39,828 --> 00:59:43,392
[The couples are being
chased after by someone!]

993
00:59:43,393 --> 00:59:45,384
- Don't come any closer!
- What's going on here?

994
00:59:45,865 --> 00:59:49,827
[While everyone's hiding in fear...]

995
00:59:49,828 --> 00:59:52,226
We can't be seen!

996
00:59:53,541 --> 00:59:57,099
[Who are these couples being
chased by?]

997
00:59:57,100 --> 01:00:02,605
[Gary and Soo Jin?]

998
01:00:02,606 --> 01:00:09,551
[Final mission-
1 vs 5- Bell hide and go seek.]

999
01:00:10,152 --> 01:00:13,227
It's a one against five,
bell hide and go seek.

1000
01:00:13,228 --> 01:00:15,062
- What?
- One against five?

1001
01:00:15,063 --> 01:00:16,452
<i>As winners of the last mission</i>

1002
01:00:16,453 --> 01:00:20,027
<i>you will be the attackers with bells on,
and you'll need to eliminate the others.</i>

1003
01:00:20,978 --> 01:00:24,975
Since you didn't win first place,
you will have to be on the defense.

1004
01:00:24,976 --> 01:00:27,114
[The remaining five couples
are to play defense.]

1005
01:00:28,874 --> 01:00:31,113
[The unique feature of this round of
hide and go seek is...]

1006
01:00:31,114 --> 01:00:35,840
[Couple name tags and a u-shaped magnet!]

1007
01:00:35,841 --> 01:00:39,435
- Are the clothes stuck together?
- We can't have name tags this large!

1008
01:00:39,436 --> 01:00:40,690
Are you kidding us?

1009
01:00:40,691 --> 01:00:47,245
<i>You have to avoid being eliminated by
the couple on the offensive</i>

1010
01:00:47,246 --> 01:00:50,635
<i>and find the U-shaped magnets
that are hidden throughout the building.</i>

1011
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:54,563
<i>The U-shaped magnets.</i>

1012
01:00:54,564 --> 01:00:58,828
<i>Once you find the real U-shaped magnet,
you'll earn a clue to where the final site is.</i>

1013
01:00:58,829 --> 01:01:02,853
<i>The first couple to find and get on the stage
at the final location will win the race.</i>

1014
01:01:02,854 --> 01:01:08,029
<i>You win if you can successfully eliminate all
five couples before the mission is over.</i>

1015
01:01:08,030 --> 01:01:09,528
[Must eliminate all five couples before
one of the other couples finds the stage!]

1016
01:01:09,529 --> 01:01:13,970
[Love is extreme!
One on Five Hide and Go Seek.]

1017
01:01:15,254 --> 01:01:17,200
I'm scared.

1018
01:01:25,360 --> 01:01:29,107
[Must find the correct U-shaped magnet
before getting ousted by the attackers.]

1019
01:01:31,132 --> 01:01:37,628
[And the couple on the attack is
the fiercely competitive Gary and Soo Jin!]

1020
01:01:38,976 --> 01:01:40,926
I can hear the bells very closely.

1021
01:01:44,395 --> 01:01:47,226
[Gary and Soo Jin are showing their
eagerness right off the get-go.]

1022
01:01:47,227 --> 01:01:49,711
[Where could they be hiding?]

1023
01:01:50,854 --> 01:01:53,263
We have to find the magnets quickly.

1024
01:01:53,264 --> 01:01:55,143
We have to find them quickly.

1025
01:01:55,876 --> 01:01:59,588
[Must find the magnets before
the attackers can find them!]

1026
01:01:59,589 --> 01:02:01,886
- What's that?
- They're just dolls.

1027
01:02:02,972 --> 01:02:04,562
Hi.

1028
01:02:05,266 --> 01:02:07,451
It's possible that they could have it.

1029
01:02:08,002 --> 01:02:11,331
[Could it be inside their bellies?]

1030
01:02:12,168 --> 01:02:15,251
[In order to escape from this terror,
they must find the correct magnet!]

1031
01:02:15,252 --> 01:02:16,621
Here it is!

1032
01:02:17,027 --> 01:02:20,748
[Suk Jin and Ji Hyo find a magnet!]

1033
01:02:20,749 --> 01:02:22,922
Is it real?

1034
01:02:22,923 --> 01:02:26,340
The bakery on the second
sub terrain level?

1035
01:02:26,375 --> 01:02:30,336
[They find some words written
on the magnet ends...]

1036
01:02:30,337 --> 01:02:32,923
[Rushing off to the bakery.]

1037
01:02:32,924 --> 01:02:34,896
Excuse me, but can we put
our magnet on you?

1038
01:02:35,465 --> 01:02:37,201
[Where do you think you're putting that?]

1039
01:02:37,202 --> 01:02:39,646
[Jong Kook and Ga Yeon are in search mode
for their magnet.]

1040
01:02:39,647 --> 01:02:41,118
There it is!

1041
01:02:42,579 --> 01:02:45,982
[Jong Kook and Ga Yeon
discover something!]

1042
01:02:46,965 --> 01:02:50,359
[Wait, their location is different than
Suk Jin and Ji Hyo's location!]

1043
01:02:50,360 --> 01:02:51,650
There's the bakery over there!

1044
01:02:51,651 --> 01:02:53,848
Be careful, we have to stick together.

1045
01:02:53,849 --> 01:02:55,406
Okay, let's hurry!

1046
01:02:55,407 --> 01:02:58,502
[They've arrived at the bakery
the magnets were indicating to.]

1047
01:02:58,503 --> 01:03:00,443
Do we have to search for something here?

1048
01:03:00,444 --> 01:03:02,777
- Second level underground...
- The bakery, right?

1049
01:03:02,778 --> 01:03:04,632
This is the bakery.

1050
01:03:05,205 --> 01:03:08,195
[Jong Kook and Ga Yeon arrive at
the bathroom on the lower first floor.]

1051
01:03:08,196 --> 01:03:12,210
[Keeping her eyes shut tight
in the male bathroom.]

1052
01:03:12,211 --> 01:03:13,506
Did you not find anything?

1053
01:03:15,307 --> 01:03:18,541
[The final stage is nowhere to be seen.]

1054
01:03:19,735 --> 01:03:23,897
[This is where the magnets indicated...]

1055
01:03:23,898 --> 01:03:25,968
What are we supposed to find?

1056
01:03:26,489 --> 01:03:29,093
Why is there such a huge gap
on that side?

1057
01:03:30,057 --> 01:03:33,339
- That must not be a match.
- No, I don't think it is.

1058
01:03:33,340 --> 01:03:40,503
[Not the right match.
A real one would stick together.]

1059
01:03:42,051 --> 01:03:44,424
- Wait.
- There's Gary over there.

1060
01:03:44,928 --> 01:03:47,555
[Gary and Soo Jin are on the other
side of the window!]

1061
01:03:47,881 --> 01:03:51,643
I'll search through this floor,
and you can search through the third floor.

1062
01:03:51,644 --> 01:03:53,603
- Shout if you find anyone.
- Okay.

1063
01:03:53,604 --> 01:03:55,935
- Gary, this is the second floor.
- You're searching where?

1064
01:03:55,936 --> 01:03:57,335
[Wait...]

1065
01:03:57,336 --> 01:04:00,765
I get the feeling that someone
is hiding down here.

1066
01:04:01,199 --> 01:04:04,324
- Above is the third floor.
- I think someone's hiding down here.

1067
01:04:05,244 --> 01:04:08,084
[Gary is closing in.]

1068
01:04:08,646 --> 01:04:10,160
[Please...]

1069
01:04:10,161 --> 01:04:12,186
[Where Suk Jin and Ji Hyo are hiding.]

1070
01:04:17,015 --> 01:04:20,607
- It's just an employee.
- It's an employee.

1071
01:04:20,608 --> 01:04:22,961
[Whew, we survived.]

1072
01:04:23,313 --> 01:04:25,169
- Yell if you need me.
- Okay.

1073
01:04:25,170 --> 01:04:28,309
[Suk Jin and Ji Hyo barely escape
a huge moment of danger.]

1074
01:04:28,833 --> 01:04:30,961
I keep hearing the sounds
of a ringing bell.

1075
01:04:30,962 --> 01:04:32,851
I'm scared.

1076
01:04:32,852 --> 01:04:34,675
[The fear must be unanimous.]

1077
01:04:34,676 --> 01:04:36,137
- Let's check there.
- What if something's in here?

1078
01:04:36,138 --> 01:04:38,952
[Such an odd couple.]

1079
01:04:40,685 --> 01:04:42,522
[So Min's right on with her intuition
and discovers a magnet.]

1080
01:04:42,523 --> 01:04:44,346
See?
I did it.

1081
01:04:45,730 --> 01:04:48,679
[You're still unaware that if they
don't match, then it's a fake magnet?]

1082
01:04:48,680 --> 01:04:51,160
[Jae Suk and Goo Roo hears their whispers,
and approaches the couple.]

1083
01:04:51,161 --> 01:04:53,286
[But just then...]

1084
01:05:01,009 --> 01:05:04,136
[Soo Jin is here!]

1085
01:05:10,487 --> 01:05:13,459
[Kwang Soo and So Min attempt
to hide behind the cashier's desk.]

1086
01:05:13,460 --> 01:05:16,457
[So Min runs past them and
keeps on after Jae Suk and Goo Roo.]

1087
01:05:19,846 --> 01:05:22,736
[Come on, feet, save us!]

1088
01:05:22,737 --> 01:05:24,258
Shut the door!

1089
01:05:25,252 --> 01:05:28,673
[Where do you think you're going?]

1090
01:05:30,616 --> 01:05:33,094
[Soo Jin catches up to them right away.]

1091
01:05:36,457 --> 01:05:39,932
[Jae Suk and Goo Roo vs
Soo Jin with the door in between.]

1092
01:05:44,762 --> 01:05:46,993
[Power up!]

1093
01:05:49,937 --> 01:05:52,247
[The door's opening!]

1094
01:05:56,481 --> 01:05:59,433
[Amazing! Soo Jin opens the door with her
foot and props the door open with her arm!]

1095
01:06:00,246 --> 01:06:02,432
[Powers up once again!]

1096
01:06:04,743 --> 01:06:08,248
[Soo Jin is overpowering these two alone!]

1097
01:06:08,249 --> 01:06:10,581
[Breaks through the barrier
in the blink of an eye!]

1098
01:06:10,582 --> 01:06:11,809
Where are you?

1099
01:06:11,810 --> 01:06:14,717
[Gary hears Soo Jin's call for help
and runs right over!]

1100
01:06:16,484 --> 01:06:19,277
[Soo Jin detains the two all by herself
until Gary arrives.]

1101
01:06:19,278 --> 01:06:21,981
[A rat caught in the trap.]

1102
01:06:21,982 --> 01:06:24,424
I know where Kwang Soo is!

1103
01:06:28,475 --> 01:06:30,434
[We're out of here!]

1104
01:06:35,821 --> 01:06:39,606
[Jae Suk and Goo Roo- Out!]

1105
01:06:40,281 --> 01:06:42,859
Thanks, Jae Suk.
Bye!

1106
01:06:43,733 --> 01:06:47,120
[Soo Jin's shocking warrior instinct.]

1107
01:06:47,121 --> 01:06:50,613
[Just what in the world happened here?]

1108
01:06:52,482 --> 01:06:55,198
- Wow, Soo Jin is no joke.
- She doesn't get flustered.

1109
01:06:55,199 --> 01:06:58,103
- No, she doesn't get flustered at all.
- She just goes after it!

1110
01:06:58,104 --> 01:07:00,551
She just screamed for Gary
to let him know where we were.

1111
01:07:00,552 --> 01:07:02,621
- Wow, she's no joke.
- Wow.

1112
01:07:02,622 --> 01:07:05,636
[These sacrificial lambs are at a loss for
words after Hurricane Soo Jin swept through.]

1113
01:07:05,637 --> 01:07:07,707
Kyung Soo Jin is the strongest
female guest we've ever had.

1114
01:07:08,435 --> 01:07:13,426
[The female warrior's role
is only just beginning.]

1115
01:07:14,128 --> 01:07:16,596
[Kwang Soo and So Min are caught
during their attempt to escape.]

1116
01:07:17,812 --> 01:07:20,764
[Soo Jin isn't letting go of her prey.]

1117
01:07:26,982 --> 01:07:31,099
[Ousts So Min first...
and time to oust Kwang Soo, too.]

1118
01:07:36,580 --> 01:07:39,099
What's this?
There's something written on there.

1119
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:43,221
[Gary and Soo Jin is sort of
onto defense team's mission.]

1120
01:07:45,022 --> 01:07:46,924
Get up, Kwang Soo.

1121
01:07:46,925 --> 01:07:49,985
[Kwang Soo and So Min- Out.]

1122
01:07:51,081 --> 01:07:54,584
[Who do we still have left?]

1123
01:08:00,056 --> 01:08:02,790
- It's sticking together.
- No, it's not.

1124
01:08:03,350 --> 01:08:06,237
[Ha Ha and Sung Kyung have just
found their third fake magnet.]

1125
01:08:07,276 --> 01:08:11,233
[Where's the real magnet that contains
the clue to the final mission location?]

1126
01:08:18,575 --> 01:08:19,952
Hide.

1127
01:08:21,331 --> 01:08:24,911
[Ha Ha and Sung Kyung hide
after hearing the ringing bells.]

1128
01:08:25,546 --> 01:08:28,024
- I think they're close.
- Be quiet.

1129
01:08:28,025 --> 01:08:29,933
Something feels off.

1130
01:08:29,934 --> 01:08:31,986
Something feels very off.

1131
01:08:42,114 --> 01:08:43,323
Hi.

1132
01:08:43,324 --> 01:08:46,350
[Make way for General Gary.]

1133
01:08:46,974 --> 01:08:49,369
How have you guys been?
Why don't you get up?

1134
01:08:50,942 --> 01:08:54,712
[This Giant-Kiddo couple have been hoping
to take home the victory today..]

1135
01:08:55,165 --> 01:08:58,815
We can tell you where the other teams are.
We know where other two teams are!

1136
01:08:58,816 --> 01:09:01,617
- They're right by us.
- Two other teams are nearby!

1137
01:09:01,618 --> 01:09:03,689
[Ratting others out to save their own lives
is a way of survival here on RM.]

1138
01:09:04,152 --> 01:09:07,117
[The female warrior makes
her way through!]

1139
01:09:10,149 --> 01:09:11,916
Let us go just this once.

1140
01:09:13,748 --> 01:09:20,724
[Female warrior's way- Once in sight,
you won't get away from me!]

1141
01:09:23,314 --> 01:09:24,761
Over.

1142
01:09:26,857 --> 01:09:28,818
- Bye!
- Sorry, Sung Kyung.

1143
01:09:28,819 --> 01:09:31,558
[Saigon goodbye with a bright
smile on her face after ousting them.]

1144
01:09:31,559 --> 01:09:33,485
- Bye!
- Sorry!

1145
01:09:34,652 --> 01:09:39,403
<i>Ha Ha and Lee Sung Kyung, out.</i>

1146
01:09:40,069 --> 01:09:41,696
Oh my goodness.

1147
01:09:41,697 --> 01:09:44,449
[The surviving couples dive into panic mode
after hearing the announcement.]

1148
01:09:44,450 --> 01:09:46,329
It's a guaranteed elimination
if they get their hands on us.

1149
01:09:46,834 --> 01:09:50,122
- There are only two couples left.
- Wait long enough, and we'll find them.

1150
01:09:50,384 --> 01:09:54,357
Can I have one of these baked goods?
Is it okay for me to eat one?

1151
01:09:54,358 --> 01:09:55,907
No, you can't.

1152
01:09:55,908 --> 01:10:00,534
You seem fine now, but as soon as
you see someone's name tag...

1153
01:10:00,535 --> 01:10:02,485
you turn into a total beast.

1154
01:10:02,486 --> 01:10:04,410
You're like Wonder Woman.

1155
01:10:06,418 --> 01:10:08,352
Wow, Soo Jin is unbelievable.

1156
01:10:15,444 --> 01:10:17,841
How can this be growing
without dirt?

1157
01:10:18,321 --> 01:10:20,012
What's this?
Soo Jin!

1158
01:10:20,392 --> 01:10:24,743
They're growing on sponges.
I think these are grown to be edible.

1159
01:10:24,744 --> 01:10:26,987
- That's amazing.
- I think they use these to make salads.

1160
01:10:28,278 --> 01:10:33,337
Soo Jin, don't most women want to shop
when they come to shopping malls like this?

1161
01:10:33,338 --> 01:10:37,170
But you have zero interest in these things,
and you're just hunting for these people.

1162
01:10:37,171 --> 01:10:39,100
[No interest in shopping, and
only in hunting down her prey.]

1163
01:10:39,101 --> 01:10:40,790
I don't know!

1164
01:10:41,859 --> 01:10:44,379
[The defense teams are
in a state of panic.]

1165
01:10:44,380 --> 01:10:45,853
It's me, Jong Kook.

1166
01:10:45,854 --> 01:10:50,441
We'll just sacrifice ourselves and
try to stall them for as long as possible

1167
01:10:50,442 --> 01:10:54,267
so take your time to freely walk around
and find the clue and the stage.

1168
01:10:54,268 --> 01:10:56,881
Jong Kook, I hear Soo Jin
is not to be messed with.

1169
01:10:56,882 --> 01:11:00,133
They're coming.
Get going, and we'll stall them.

1170
01:11:00,839 --> 01:11:03,930
- Let's go find it.
- We have to hurry.

1171
01:11:03,931 --> 01:11:05,327
[Suk Jin and Ji Hyo start their search
through their friends' self-sacrifice.]

1172
01:11:06,127 --> 01:11:08,209
Let's just go out there confidently.

1173
01:11:08,210 --> 01:11:11,406
Walk out there confidently,
and run if we need to.

1174
01:11:12,488 --> 01:11:17,884
[Will they find the magnet first,
or will they eliminate their prey first?]

1175
01:11:22,279 --> 01:11:24,843
[Jong Kook and Ga Yeon make their move
to buy some time for Suk Jin and Ji Hyo.]

1176
01:11:27,381 --> 01:11:30,873
[The couple spots Soo Jin.]

1177
01:11:30,874 --> 01:11:32,687
I think she saw us.

1178
01:11:36,260 --> 01:11:39,164
[Soo Jin picks up their scent
and starts the chase.]

1179
01:11:44,729 --> 01:11:46,189
Gary!

1180
01:11:47,205 --> 01:11:49,689
- Where could they be?
- Here's one!

1181
01:11:51,689 --> 01:11:54,049
[Could this be the right match?]

1182
01:11:57,562 --> 01:11:59,992
It's not sticking.
It's a fake.

1183
01:12:01,295 --> 01:12:06,028
[Jong Kook and Ga Yeon
lure Soo Jin away.]

1184
01:12:06,029 --> 01:12:07,698
Gary!

1185
01:12:09,102 --> 01:12:12,293
[Immediately finds another magnet.]

1186
01:12:14,498 --> 01:12:16,216
I can't believe we found one there.

1187
01:12:16,954 --> 01:12:18,620
[This one isn't a match either!]

1188
01:12:20,674 --> 01:12:22,186
Gary!

1189
01:12:22,187 --> 01:12:24,795
[Leading her further away to
buy some more time.]

1190
01:12:25,614 --> 01:12:27,426
Gary!

1191
01:12:27,427 --> 01:12:31,350
[Soo Jin calls out to Gary relentlessly.]

1192
01:12:33,414 --> 01:12:36,404
[Time is really starting to run out.]

1193
01:12:38,716 --> 01:12:42,262
[Oh? It's sticking together!]

1194
01:12:43,503 --> 01:12:45,508
[They just need to safely
get to the final stage location!]

1195
01:12:46,313 --> 01:12:49,128
[Just then, Jong Kook and Ga Yeon
run into a dead end!]

1196
01:12:50,258 --> 01:12:51,932
- Over here!
- Where?

1197
01:12:51,933 --> 01:12:55,436
[Gary and Soo Jin close in
on their prey.]

1198
01:12:57,407 --> 01:13:00,503
[Suk Jin and Ji Hyo are off to the
training room on the lower third floor.]

1199
01:13:02,189 --> 01:13:04,675
[And finally- Jong Kook and Ga Yeon
vs Gary and Soo Jin.]

1200
01:13:04,676 --> 01:13:09,866
[We have to stall them in order for Suk Jin
and Ji Hyo to get to the final stage!]

1201
01:13:10,991 --> 01:13:14,233
[Please stall them for just a bit longer!]

1202
01:13:15,772 --> 01:13:17,887
[Hurry!]

1203
01:13:22,438 --> 01:13:27,452
[But Jong Kook and Ga Yeon
are ultimately ousted.]

1204
01:13:27,453 --> 01:13:31,946
[The only two left... are us!]

1205
01:13:31,947 --> 01:13:35,111
[A dead run toward the final stage!]

1206
01:13:35,112 --> 01:13:36,935
Where could they be hiding?

1207
01:13:36,936 --> 01:13:39,342
[Gary and Soo Jin are hot
on the chase!]

1208
01:13:40,961 --> 01:13:42,333
[This way!]

1209
01:13:42,334 --> 01:13:47,759
[Will they get to the stage first,
or will they be eliminated first?]

1210
01:13:52,529 --> 01:13:55,773
[Carefully makes her way through.]

1211
01:13:56,663 --> 01:13:58,986
[Gary is spotted in the distance.]

1212
01:13:59,865 --> 01:14:01,584
[Got you!]

1213
01:14:01,585 --> 01:14:03,537
[Run!]

1214
01:14:05,186 --> 01:14:08,302
[The final stage is right
in front of their eyes!]

1215
01:14:10,040 --> 01:14:15,916
[But... Gary closes in on them
like a bolt of lightning!]

1216
01:14:17,647 --> 01:14:19,393
Gary!

1217
01:14:24,405 --> 01:14:25,919
Gary!

1218
01:14:26,348 --> 01:14:30,327
[Will they hold out... or will he end them?]

1219
01:14:32,307 --> 01:14:35,257
[Suk Jin and Ji Hyo are ousted
right in front of their winning stage!]

1220
01:14:37,434 --> 01:14:41,676
[Soo Jin... we did it!]

1221
01:14:41,677 --> 01:14:43,558
<i>Kyung Soo Jin won.</i>

1222
01:14:43,559 --> 01:14:45,576
<i>It was Kyung Soo Jin's win!</i>

1223
01:14:47,198 --> 01:14:50,454
[Gary and Soo Jin takes their place
on top of the winning stage.]

1224
01:14:54,324 --> 01:15:00,904
[Love is Extreme Race-
Winning prize is a gold couple ring.]

1225
01:15:00,905 --> 01:15:05,131
You did work very hard.
Soo Jin, your smile is...

1226
01:15:05,132 --> 01:15:07,898
- It's all a lie!
- Her smile is not to be trusted.

1227
01:15:09,421 --> 01:15:14,626
The final winning couple of the day is,
Gary and Kyung Soo Jin!

1228
01:15:14,627 --> 01:15:16,957
[Love is Extreme Race-
Gary and Soo Jin are the winners!]

1229
01:15:19,176 --> 01:15:23,691
I want to see Ga Yeon giving Gary
a low kick instead of regular slate shot.

1230
01:15:23,692 --> 01:15:25,821
Why are you doing this to me?

1231
01:15:25,822 --> 01:15:28,201
Ga Yeon, can you show it to us?

1232
01:15:29,514 --> 01:15:32,496
- It's the price to pay for winning!
- Come on!

1233
01:15:32,497 --> 01:15:33,970
[A payback from all the
defensive teams.]

1234
01:15:33,971 --> 01:15:37,047
- It'll hurt more if you try to block her.
- Your think I'm crazy?

1235
01:15:39,458 --> 01:15:42,449
- Thank you!
- Thank you!

1236
01:15:47,681 --> 01:15:50,366
[The first ever low kick slate shot.]

1237
01:15:55,709 --> 01:15:58,612
Wow, that looked really painful.
Ga Yeon is awesome.

1238
01:15:58,613 --> 01:16:00,945
<i>[Thank you to our guests for
all the laughter they brought us.]</i>
