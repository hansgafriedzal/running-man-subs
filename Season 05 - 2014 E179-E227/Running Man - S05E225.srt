1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Running Man

2
00:00:05,701 --> 00:00:06,965
Bro...

3
00:00:06,966 --> 00:00:11,069
I hear... that a huge business
deal is going down tonight.

4
00:00:12,609 --> 00:00:14,313
Want to hear what it is?

5
00:00:15,563 --> 00:00:20,564
I heard that an ancient noble script
will be revealed tonight.

6
00:00:20,985 --> 00:00:30,571
But without any other members finding out,
I want just us two to get it.

7
00:00:31,269 --> 00:00:33,401
What do you think?
Want to do it with me?

8
00:00:36,869 --> 00:00:38,157
Yeah.

9
00:00:48,883 --> 00:00:51,375
I'm sorry, can we do that again?

10
00:00:57,493 --> 00:01:00,038
I've never seen an
expression like that before.

11
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:02,721
[Working with a five star rated actor.]

12
00:01:02,722 --> 00:01:04,113
I'll explain it to you.

13
00:01:04,114 --> 00:01:06,579
We'll be eliminating them
in a very unique way today.

14
00:01:07,017 --> 00:01:10,133
Instead of ripping off their name tags,
we'll be writing their names on the tags.

15
00:01:10,134 --> 00:01:12,569
- Write it?
- Yes, write it.

16
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:15,022
It's a very simple method.

17
00:01:15,023 --> 00:01:17,737
We're going to search for blank
name tags.

18
00:01:17,738 --> 00:01:22,039
- And if we write the member's name on it...
- Write the name on the tag?

19
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,059
Once we write their name on the tag,
then they'll be ousted.

20
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:27,973
- Then they'll wonder why they're ousted.
- They won't even know why they're ousted.

21
00:01:27,974 --> 00:01:32,177
They won't even know that there
are spies, and we'll just...

22
00:01:32,212 --> 00:01:33,583
We'll find...

23
00:01:35,105 --> 00:01:39,228
It's no joke, is it? I didn't
know Running Man was this cool.

24
00:01:39,229 --> 00:01:42,345
They're always surprising me
with each new episode.

25
00:01:42,346 --> 00:01:45,068
We don't need to rip it off anymore.

26
00:01:46,171 --> 00:01:47,803
That's too brutal of a method.

27
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:51,234
There are more dignified and
easier ways to do it, such as this.

28
00:01:51,235 --> 00:01:53,319
- Look at how simple this is.
- That's right.

29
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,848
- There's no need to exert all our strength.
- And ripping people's clothing, too!

30
00:01:56,463 --> 00:01:58,973
- All that was unnecessary.
- No, it's not necessary.

31
00:01:58,974 --> 00:02:01,635
If we can win the mission

32
00:02:01,636 --> 00:02:04,834
then we'll be given a tool which will
help us oust the other members.

33
00:02:04,835 --> 00:02:06,691
- And we'll...
- A tool?

34
00:02:06,692 --> 00:02:10,323
- I heard it's a very important tool.
- Is it a pen?

35
00:02:10,324 --> 00:02:13,737
I have a feeling it's something similar,
and we have to...

36
00:02:13,738 --> 00:02:17,997
I could hear the producers muttering
something as soon as I said, 'pen.'

37
00:02:18,669 --> 00:02:21,010
I was going to pretend that
I didn't hear any of it.

38
00:02:21,384 --> 00:02:24,557
But they're talking about how smart I am.
I'm going to shatter it today.

39
00:02:24,558 --> 00:02:26,861
- The image that I've always had...
- Today's the day.

40
00:02:26,862 --> 00:02:29,521
- I'm going to shatter their perception of me.
- Show them what the Asian Prince can do.

41
00:02:29,522 --> 00:02:31,629
I'm really smart.
I'm a college graduate.

42
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:34,139
- Really? I had no idea.
- Yeah.

43
00:02:34,907 --> 00:02:37,013
- I'm going to show them.
- Today's the day.

44
00:02:37,014 --> 00:02:38,100
Let's do this.

45
00:02:38,101 --> 00:02:40,238
[Brain Kwang Soo and Woo Bin's spy plans.]

46
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:47,075
I've got some information on the experts
of each category whom we'll be facing today.

47
00:02:47,076 --> 00:02:51,941
Yoo Jae Suk, who can open any doors
and locks with the use of flour.

48
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:57,010
[There isn't a door that I can't open!]

49
00:02:57,499 --> 00:02:59,230
[Human opener, Yoo Jae Suk.]

50
00:02:59,231 --> 00:03:04,965
Ji Suk Jin, who can open the locks with
the use of a special eye retina scan.

51
00:03:08,273 --> 00:03:10,152
[Eye retina master, Ji Suk Jin.]

52
00:03:10,153 --> 00:03:13,930
[Kim Jong Kook, a man who can break
through anything with his strength.]

53
00:03:13,931 --> 00:03:15,425
[Human tank, Kim Jong Kook.]

54
00:03:16,324 --> 00:03:18,313
A human tank?

55
00:03:18,795 --> 00:03:20,866
So, Jong Kook doesn't
have any special powers.

56
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:22,536
[Kkuk is just his usual Kkuk self.]

57
00:03:24,512 --> 00:03:29,571
[Monday couple, Gary and Ji Hyo,
who can climb anything with compressors.]

58
00:03:29,572 --> 00:03:31,066
[Moonlight Monday Couple, Gary and Ji Hyo.]

59
00:03:31,533 --> 00:03:33,591
Gary, we made it!

60
00:03:33,994 --> 00:03:36,735
- We've made it!
- Grab my hand.

61
00:03:36,736 --> 00:03:41,984
Ha Ha, who has the ability to manipulate
and diffuse any sort of bombs.

62
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:44,512
[Bomb expert, Ha Ha.]

63
00:03:44,513 --> 00:03:48,222
Five, four, three, two...

64
00:03:48,223 --> 00:03:49,942
Oh my goodness!

65
00:03:51,238 --> 00:03:53,192
[Slightly less than perfect experts.]

66
00:03:53,193 --> 00:03:59,853
Lastly, the expert who can camouflage himself
in any sort of surrounding, Lee Kwang Soo.

67
00:03:59,854 --> 00:04:01,654
That would be me.

68
00:04:01,655 --> 00:04:03,341
That would be you.

69
00:04:03,342 --> 00:04:05,572
The master of concealment.

70
00:04:05,573 --> 00:04:07,833
[The master of concealing himself
from sight.]

71
00:04:07,834 --> 00:04:10,616
[Master of the disappearing act,
Lee Kwang Soo.]

72
00:04:15,994 --> 00:04:18,760
[His disappearing act!]

73
00:04:21,626 --> 00:04:25,476
[His presence cannot be
detected by anyone.]

74
00:04:27,215 --> 00:04:28,789
What do you think?

75
00:04:31,943 --> 00:04:34,582
[Kwang Soo disappears in front of
Woo Bin's very own eyes.]

76
00:04:35,408 --> 00:04:36,930
I'm right here.

77
00:04:37,308 --> 00:04:39,110
[The true master of the disappearing act.]

78
00:04:39,111 --> 00:04:43,284
- The members thinks of me as an airhead.
- Yes, you're very misunderstood.

79
00:04:43,285 --> 00:04:45,958
- They think you're stupid.
- You know that it's all an act, right?

80
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:49,002
The last three times that I've been on
the show was in preparation for today.

81
00:04:49,003 --> 00:04:51,414
Are you aware that it's all been an act
just to build up to this episode?

82
00:04:51,415 --> 00:04:53,999
My stupidity that you saw for the past
five years has all been an act, too.

83
00:04:54,635 --> 00:04:57,338
- It was all for this moment.
- I knew it.

84
00:04:57,914 --> 00:04:59,152
Let's do this.

85
00:04:59,153 --> 00:05:01,554
[Two 'pretend' airheads'
passionate embrace.]

86
00:05:01,555 --> 00:05:04,714
You and I are the only ones
who are aware of today's real mission.

87
00:05:04,715 --> 00:05:05,906
Okay.

88
00:05:07,044 --> 00:05:09,851
[Woo Bin and Kwang Soo's oath of secrecy.]

89
00:05:09,852 --> 00:05:12,064
Where do we go now?

90
00:05:13,943 --> 00:05:17,096
[What fate awaits these two
clumsy airheaded spy brothers?]

91
00:05:17,097 --> 00:05:18,624
We're totally ruined.

92
00:05:18,625 --> 00:05:20,517
[One hour later.]

93
00:05:20,518 --> 00:05:22,715
[Seoul Museum of Art.]

94
00:05:22,716 --> 00:05:24,637
- Did everyone get their secret number?
- Yes.

95
00:05:25,838 --> 00:05:28,273
- I wonder if they're all the same?
- Should we all open it together?

96
00:05:28,274 --> 00:05:30,425
I think we need to open it together.

97
00:05:31,468 --> 00:05:33,446
- One.
- Six.

98
00:05:33,447 --> 00:05:37,120
[Configuring the numbers together for this
group of experts is like a walk in the park.]

99
00:05:37,121 --> 00:05:39,069
- It's opening!
- It's unlocked!

100
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:40,603
The safe is finally opening!

101
00:05:52,055 --> 00:05:54,306
What is it?
What the heck is this?

102
00:05:55,342 --> 00:05:57,182
- What the heck?
- Is it Woo Bin?

103
00:05:57,183 --> 00:05:59,773
[The safe contains human beings?]

104
00:06:01,254 --> 00:06:03,901
[Enigmatic man of masculinity,
Kim Woo Bin.]

105
00:06:03,902 --> 00:06:05,850
Long time no see!

106
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,695
[And standing next to him is...]

107
00:06:07,696 --> 00:06:11,118
[The Nation's favorite youth,
Lee Hyun Woo.]

108
00:06:14,552 --> 00:06:16,558
It's been so long!

109
00:06:16,559 --> 00:06:19,131
[Two men, who are more precious
than any other gemstone.]

110
00:06:20,473 --> 00:06:23,434
[While others are enthusiastically
greeting the two guests...]

111
00:06:25,546 --> 00:06:29,968
<i>'Kwang Soo, you and I are the only
ones who know of this.'</i>

112
00:06:29,969 --> 00:06:32,820
[The hidden meaning behind their hug.]

113
00:06:32,821 --> 00:06:34,142
[To escape others' suspicion,
Woo Bin moves onto hug Gary.]

114
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:37,504
- Hyun Woo looks like a man now.
- He was like a kid when he was last here.

115
00:06:37,505 --> 00:06:39,859
- How old are you now?
- I'm 22 years old.

116
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:41,697
- You're a man now.
- He's taller, too.

117
00:06:41,698 --> 00:06:43,664
Kwang Soo looks like a guest
standing next to Woo Bin.

118
00:06:43,665 --> 00:06:46,605
- We should greet you, too.
- Woo Bin knows how to carry his height.

119
00:06:46,606 --> 00:06:50,450
Everyone has their own style.
We all have our own style.

120
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:55,162
- You really look like a squid.
- We need to trade spots!

121
00:06:55,163 --> 00:06:56,531
I don't want to switch spots either!

122
00:06:56,531 --> 00:06:58,741
[Everyone's too frightened to
stand next to Woo Bin.]

123
00:07:00,797 --> 00:07:05,269
Before I explain the rules of the race,
allow me to announce the teams.

124
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:06,859
[Time to announce the teams.]

125
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:08,475
- Kim Woo Bin.
- Yes.

126
00:07:08,476 --> 00:07:10,473
You're teamed up with Yoo Jae Suk
and Lee Kwang Soo.

127
00:07:10,774 --> 00:07:13,107
All the good looking men
are teamed up together.

128
00:07:13,108 --> 00:07:15,813
This is why people always say
that similar people hang out together.

129
00:07:15,814 --> 00:07:20,274
- All the good looking ones are together.
- Two squids are teamed up with Woo Bin.

130
00:07:20,275 --> 00:07:22,242
[Looks genuinely happy.]

131
00:07:22,243 --> 00:07:24,381
Woo Bin looks especially
good looking right now.

132
00:07:26,392 --> 00:07:28,831
[The squid effect of making a good looking
man appear even better looking?]

133
00:07:28,832 --> 00:07:34,018
[He seriously...
does look even more handsome.]

134
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:40,340
The next team will be Lee Hyun Woo
with Kim Jong Kook and Song Ji Hyo.

135
00:07:40,341 --> 00:07:42,042
[Lee Hyun Woo, Kim Jong Kook
and Song Ji Hyo.]

136
00:07:42,043 --> 00:07:45,310
The rest are like a bomb squad.

137
00:07:45,311 --> 00:07:48,558
[The rest- Ha Ha, Big-nose and Gary.
The bomb squad.]

138
00:07:49,859 --> 00:07:51,966
[Ha Ha, Big-nose and Gary.]

139
00:07:51,967 --> 00:07:53,372
I'm still going to have to
stand in the middle.

140
00:07:53,373 --> 00:07:55,826
Why would you stand in the middle?

141
00:07:56,804 --> 00:08:00,132
- Just take a look at us.
- Here are the rules.

142
00:08:00,133 --> 00:08:03,278
Today's race is, The Technician Race.

143
00:08:03,666 --> 00:08:06,112
- Have you all been to the National Museum?
- Yes.

144
00:08:06,113 --> 00:08:12,769
An ancient script, which all the legendary
thieves are searching for is in the museum.

145
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:16,419
The person who gets the ancient script
will become today's winner.

146
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:18,451
Each time you win a mission

147
00:08:18,452 --> 00:08:22,257
an item will be given to you which will
be critical to your win at the final mission.

148
00:08:22,258 --> 00:08:26,398
Thus, you will have to give it your
best efforts to win the missions.

149
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:29,661
[That will be ours.]

150
00:08:30,471 --> 00:08:31,847
[There are no safety zones!]

151
00:08:31,882 --> 00:08:33,746
[You're already ousted!]

152
00:08:34,337 --> 00:08:37,519
[The operation order:
Signature Technique Elimination.]

153
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:40,872
- Is it an individual race?
- Only the last mission.

154
00:08:40,873 --> 00:08:43,973
But the rest of the game will be played
with three people per team.

155
00:08:43,974 --> 00:08:47,158
- The two of you are a team.
- I see.

156
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:49,704
- Two people per team?
- No, three per team.

157
00:08:49,705 --> 00:08:52,112
- I see.
- It'll be announced at the opening.

158
00:08:52,113 --> 00:08:55,455
Wow, the other person on our team
will end up looking like a fool.

159
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:06,298
Jae Suk, we're going to win
the first game, right?

160
00:09:06,612 --> 00:09:08,807
Why would you even ask such a thing?
Isn't that a given?

161
00:09:09,155 --> 00:09:10,761
Of course, we'll have to win
the first game.

162
00:09:11,182 --> 00:09:14,046
You're a spy, aren't you?

163
00:09:17,506 --> 00:09:19,478
- Kwang Soo, are you a spy?
- Are you?

164
00:09:19,479 --> 00:09:22,681
How do you get to me being a spy
from me asking you that question?

165
00:09:22,682 --> 00:09:24,837
Why would you suddenly ask such a thing
if you're not a spy?

166
00:09:26,198 --> 00:09:29,801
- Kwang Soo, you're really something else.
- Let's just win all the games today.

167
00:09:29,802 --> 00:09:32,372
- Of course.
- For real.

168
00:09:35,094 --> 00:09:37,022
[Seriously, Kwang Soo!]

169
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:39,098
[Sorry...]

170
00:09:40,666 --> 00:09:45,436
[The first snowfall of 2014.]

171
00:09:45,437 --> 00:09:50,686
[The heart of Seoul- Myungdong.]

172
00:09:50,687 --> 00:09:54,612
[This is the first mission site of the day.]

173
00:09:55,501 --> 00:09:57,153
- Okay, let's get out.
- Okay.

174
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:01,545
Wow, it's been so long
since I've been to Myungdong.

175
00:10:03,239 --> 00:10:06,466
Wow, I really love Myungdong.

176
00:10:06,467 --> 00:10:10,006
[The center of Myungdong is bustling
with holiday shoppers.]

177
00:10:10,007 --> 00:10:15,150
[What is the first mission
that awaits them here?]

178
00:10:15,151 --> 00:10:18,094
Wow, I don't even remember
the last time I was here.

179
00:10:18,095 --> 00:10:21,258
[Team Black is excited to take in
the sights of Myungdong streets.]

180
00:10:22,249 --> 00:10:25,501
[A horizontal bar awaits their arrival.]

181
00:10:25,502 --> 00:10:29,103
- Is that a horizontal bar?
- It's in the middle of the street!

182
00:10:29,952 --> 00:10:31,563
What is this?

183
00:10:31,564 --> 00:10:33,700
- Jong Kook, I think we need to hurry.
- Already?

184
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:37,122
- They're already here.
- Already?

185
00:10:38,007 --> 00:10:40,746
[Team Red arrives soon thereafter.]

186
00:10:40,747 --> 00:10:43,437
- Come on, hurry!
- What is this?

187
00:10:43,438 --> 00:10:45,615
[What is their first mission that's to take
place in the middle of Myungdong streets?]

188
00:10:46,471 --> 00:10:48,819
- Gae!
- Married-Men-Cross!

189
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:52,658
- Why do you do that all the time?
- We're determined to win.

190
00:10:52,659 --> 00:10:53,922
Okay, here's your mission.

191
00:10:53,923 --> 00:10:57,236
This is a mission to help solidify
your teamwork skills.

192
00:10:57,237 --> 00:10:59,424
Technician's teamwork mission.

193
00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:03,382
[At last... it's begun.]

194
00:11:03,383 --> 00:11:06,307
One member from each team will
hang from the horizontal bar.

195
00:11:06,342 --> 00:11:08,157
While the person is hanging from the bar

196
00:11:08,158 --> 00:11:11,000
the other two members will have to
successfully complete a task

197
00:11:11,001 --> 00:11:12,133
they're given and return to the bar.

198
00:11:12,134 --> 00:11:17,800
You'll have to return and ring the bell before
your teammate falls in order to succeed.

199
00:11:17,801 --> 00:11:21,185
But if your teammate falls off before then,
you fail the mission immediately.

200
00:11:21,186 --> 00:11:24,778
I just heard something really frightening
from this team right now.

201
00:11:24,779 --> 00:11:26,544
Suk Jin asked if he should do it.

202
00:11:26,545 --> 00:11:28,437
[Surreal to hear Suk Jin ask
if he should hang from the bar.]

203
00:11:29,268 --> 00:11:32,610
[Suk Jin offers to hang from the bar
due to the younger member's hurt shoulder.]

204
00:11:32,611 --> 00:11:35,526
- What a team, you are!
- It's all in the frame of mind!

205
00:11:35,527 --> 00:11:37,799
[Even though their bodies may be frail,
their voices sound stronger than ever!]

206
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:42,339
The team that wins this mission will earn
a very important clue to the final mission

207
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:45,774
and the advantage to leave first
for the next site.

208
00:11:45,775 --> 00:11:47,094
[Okay, mission accepted.]

209
00:11:47,129 --> 00:11:51,995
They look like a couple of athletes
in training with their trainer.

210
00:11:51,996 --> 00:11:53,991
- They're trainees.
- I'll work very hard!

211
00:11:58,102 --> 00:12:00,927
[Kwang Soo and Woo Bin are exchanging
secret looks with the mission ahead.]

212
00:12:01,994 --> 00:12:03,469
- Woo Bin!
- Yes?

213
00:12:04,178 --> 00:12:05,986
- Woo Bin!
- Yes?

214
00:12:05,987 --> 00:12:07,496
[Have we been caught?]

215
00:12:08,274 --> 00:12:10,812
- Let's win this.
- Let's do this!

216
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:14,264
We'll be really fast, so don't worry.
Kwang Soo and I are lightning fast.

217
00:12:16,067 --> 00:12:19,488
[These worrisome guys...
will they be able to succeed?]

218
00:12:20,562 --> 00:12:23,802
First mission. While your teammates are
hanging from the horizontal bar...

219
00:12:23,803 --> 00:12:26,856
- We're in trouble. He's going to be good.
- No, I'm wearing too many layers.

220
00:12:26,857 --> 00:12:30,955
[Bring back the food items on the menu
before their teammate falls off.]

221
00:12:33,069 --> 00:12:35,165
- You need to stay back.
- Hey!

222
00:12:35,166 --> 00:12:37,116
[You have to be back before I fall off!]

223
00:12:37,117 --> 00:12:39,482
One, two, pick!

224
00:12:39,483 --> 00:12:40,870
[Choose the menu.]

225
00:12:40,871 --> 00:12:42,344
You can't leave yet.

226
00:12:42,345 --> 00:12:44,082
- What's this?
- What is this?

227
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:48,734
[Complicated drink menus are given
to all three teams.]

228
00:12:48,735 --> 00:12:51,692
- What is this?
- Memorize the items instead of complaining.

229
00:12:51,693 --> 00:12:53,136
[Must memorize the full menu.]

230
00:12:53,672 --> 00:12:55,351
Do you think you can do it?
Is it hard or easy?

231
00:12:55,352 --> 00:12:57,317
Ji Hyo and Hyun Woo,
you have to do a good job.

232
00:12:57,318 --> 00:12:59,352
[Iced caramel macchiato with
extra chocolate syrup and cinnamon...]

233
00:12:59,353 --> 00:13:02,631
[A confusing menu
that's difficult to even comprehend.]

234
00:13:02,632 --> 00:13:04,427
Ready, set, go!

235
00:13:10,006 --> 00:13:12,922
[Must deliver the items on the menu
before their teammate falls off.]

236
00:13:14,045 --> 00:13:17,130
[Repeating the menu to themselves
to deter from forgetting it.]

237
00:13:18,313 --> 00:13:20,636
- Where's a coffee shop?
- Do you know?

238
00:13:20,637 --> 00:13:23,437
- There it is!
- I see it! It's over there.

239
00:13:23,438 --> 00:13:25,437
There it is!
Let's go!

240
00:13:25,438 --> 00:13:27,908
[Must speed up! Running
through the streets of Myungdong.]

241
00:13:33,196 --> 00:13:35,701
<i>Kwang Soo, if we win
the missions along the way</i>

242
00:13:35,702 --> 00:13:39,078
<i>we'll be given a tool which will be critical
in helping us oust the other members.</i>

243
00:13:39,079 --> 00:13:43,089
<i>I think it's going to be a necessary tool
in order for us to oust them.</i>

244
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:46,676
[We must win the mission in order to
earn the tool to oust the other members.]

245
00:13:47,918 --> 00:13:49,225
Hey!

246
00:13:49,226 --> 00:13:50,908
[Breaks out the cheating moves.]

247
00:13:50,909 --> 00:13:53,405
- Seriously!
- Wow, Woo Bin.

248
00:13:53,406 --> 00:13:56,096
- Kim Woo Bin, seriously!
- This is so comfortable.

249
00:13:57,362 --> 00:14:00,048
You fail the mission the moment you fall off
unless your teammates are back.

250
00:14:00,049 --> 00:14:02,706
- Hey!
- Let me rest my legs, too.

251
00:14:02,707 --> 00:14:03,953
Hey!

252
00:14:04,575 --> 00:14:07,914
[I'm sorry, Suk Jin,
but I really have to win.]

253
00:14:07,915 --> 00:14:11,585
- Where's the coffee shop?
- There it is!

254
00:14:11,586 --> 00:14:13,142
[Team Black discovers a coffee shop.]

255
00:14:13,143 --> 00:14:15,115
Will they have what we need?

256
00:14:15,116 --> 00:14:17,217
[Will they have remembered their menu?]

257
00:14:17,218 --> 00:14:19,886
- Hello.
- Hello.

258
00:14:19,887 --> 00:14:22,820
- Do you have caramel macchiato?
- There it is.

259
00:14:22,821 --> 00:14:27,233
- Cinnamon powder and chocolate powder...
- Chocolate.

260
00:14:27,234 --> 00:14:28,463
[What are they trying to order?]

261
00:14:28,464 --> 00:14:34,552
[Iced caramel macchiato with extra chocolate
and cinnamon powder, minus whip, with soy.]

262
00:14:34,552 --> 00:14:37,697
With soy, and minus the whipped cream.

263
00:14:37,698 --> 00:14:39,853
- I'm sorry, but it's a mission.
- Do you want it iced?

264
00:14:39,854 --> 00:14:42,156
Yes, iced!
Is it not?

265
00:14:42,157 --> 00:14:44,899
- No, hot.
- Is it hot?

266
00:14:45,383 --> 00:14:49,904
[Repeating their drink order.]

267
00:14:49,905 --> 00:14:51,601
- With soymilk!
- Yes, soymilk.

268
00:14:51,602 --> 00:14:55,693
- Wow, you can actually order it like that?
- I didn't know that you could.

269
00:14:55,694 --> 00:14:57,276
Do people normally order
the chocolate powder?

270
00:14:57,277 --> 00:14:59,028
They don't?

271
00:14:59,968 --> 00:15:02,945
[Team Blue and Team Red
run into the same coffee shop.]

272
00:15:02,946 --> 00:15:06,784
[Tall English breakfast tea latte with
fat free milk, and with drink sleeve.]

273
00:15:06,785 --> 00:15:09,334
- Tea latte.
- English breakfast tea latte?

274
00:15:09,335 --> 00:15:11,109
No, they want iced cafe mocha.

275
00:15:13,328 --> 00:15:17,287
English breakfast tea latte
with fat free milk.

276
00:15:17,288 --> 00:15:19,522
- What size?
- Tall.

277
00:15:19,523 --> 00:15:22,688
- With a drink sleeve.
- They want a Grande size.

278
00:15:22,689 --> 00:15:25,298
- No, a tall.
- Tall, please.

279
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:29,268
I'm sorry for all the rushing.
We're not finished yet!

280
00:15:29,269 --> 00:15:31,821
We're not finished yet.
We have to pay first!

281
00:15:31,822 --> 00:15:33,672
[Team Red shouts out their order.]

282
00:15:34,222 --> 00:15:37,769
[Grande iced cafe mocha with a drizzle of
chocolate and caramel syrup with whip.]

283
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:40,674
- Drizzle it.
- Drizzle the sauce on it.

284
00:15:41,626 --> 00:15:44,040
Are you listening to us?

285
00:15:44,041 --> 00:15:45,979
Thank you so much.

286
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:54,922
Whipped cream with a drizzle of
caramel and chocolate sauce on top.

287
00:15:54,923 --> 00:15:56,759
Drizzle the sauce on top.

288
00:15:56,933 --> 00:15:59,472
Please give us our order first.

289
00:15:59,473 --> 00:16:01,227
- Please help us out.
- Would you like a receipt?

290
00:16:01,228 --> 00:16:03,870
- No, it's okay.
- Please make ours first.

291
00:16:03,871 --> 00:16:06,890
Barista!
Will the cafe mocha be out first?

292
00:16:07,146 --> 00:16:08,408
No, I don't think so.

293
00:16:08,409 --> 00:16:10,854
Can you both work on the drinks?

294
00:16:10,855 --> 00:16:14,470
Is that drink going to be any good?
It's not, is it?

295
00:16:14,471 --> 00:16:16,457
Why are they making us get something
that isn't even good?

296
00:16:16,458 --> 00:16:19,121
- Can I ask for a glass of water?
- It's done.

297
00:16:19,373 --> 00:16:21,989
- We don't need the water, thank you.
- I need some water.

298
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:27,630
- Woo Bin is waiting for us. Thank you!
- Just a glass of water? Thank you!

299
00:16:27,957 --> 00:16:30,943
[No time to waste,
back to the judging table!]

300
00:16:32,734 --> 00:16:35,007
Is this ours?

301
00:16:35,008 --> 00:16:37,072
[Team Blue's drink is also ready.]

302
00:16:37,073 --> 00:16:40,122
Thank you.
Let's go, Hyun Woo.

303
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:43,966
[Team Blue also sprints back
to the judging table.]

304
00:16:45,162 --> 00:16:47,765
Thank you.
Grab a straw.

305
00:16:48,486 --> 00:16:51,886
[Team Red is also on their way.]

306
00:16:53,142 --> 00:16:56,734
[Heads back without knowing what's
going on at the horizontal bar.]

307
00:16:57,132 --> 00:16:59,584
- Hey, Woo Bin!
- Excuse me!

308
00:17:00,094 --> 00:17:04,459
[Team Blue is the first to arrive
back at the judging table.]

309
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:06,195
We're the first ones back!

310
00:17:06,196 --> 00:17:08,401
Close the rope.

311
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:13,414
[Huh?]

312
00:17:14,964 --> 00:17:22,785
Tall English breakfast tea latte with
fat free milk, and with drink sleeve.

313
00:17:22,786 --> 00:17:25,240
Jong Kook, why did you fall off?
What are you doing?

314
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:27,316
[Drink is correct, but fails because
Kkuk fell off from the horizontal bar.]

315
00:17:28,416 --> 00:17:31,724
[Just then, Team Red arrives.]

316
00:17:31,725 --> 00:17:33,518
Hurry!

317
00:17:33,892 --> 00:17:35,440
Hurry!

318
00:17:37,573 --> 00:17:39,851
[Team Red also gets their drink correct.]

319
00:17:42,516 --> 00:17:45,076
[Team Black is the last to arrive.]

320
00:17:45,077 --> 00:17:47,856
- What took you guys so long?
- Why did you fall off already?

321
00:17:48,522 --> 00:17:56,855
Caramel macchiato with extra chocolate
and cinnamon powder, minus whip, with soy.

322
00:17:56,856 --> 00:17:59,328
You were told to get iced,
but you got it hot.

323
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:02,591
[Team Black fails to
bring back the correct drink.]

324
00:18:02,592 --> 00:18:07,853
All three members fell off the bar,
so all three teams fails the mission.

325
00:18:07,854 --> 00:18:09,767
[All three teams fails
the first attempt at the mission.]

326
00:18:09,768 --> 00:18:12,531
[Then what was Big-nose doing
back on the bar?]

327
00:18:18,651 --> 00:18:21,327
[Woo Bin easily eliminates Big-nose
from the bar.]

328
00:18:23,975 --> 00:18:27,367
[And goes onto eliminating
Mr. Capable, as well.]

329
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:33,759
[But falls off the bar from exhaustion.]

330
00:18:34,758 --> 00:18:37,271
Hey, how about I hang from the bar
by myself when they return?

331
00:18:38,475 --> 00:18:40,155
Let's see how they react
when they see it.

332
00:18:40,156 --> 00:18:42,103
Excuse me!

333
00:18:43,078 --> 00:18:48,093
[Big-nosed Brother fools
everyone with his prank.]

334
00:18:52,062 --> 00:18:55,570
They said what you ordered isn't even
any good, so why did you order it like that?

335
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:59,174
- Is that what they said?
- Yes, they said it's really awful.

336
00:18:59,175 --> 00:19:00,524
[Everyone has different tastes.]

337
00:19:00,525 --> 00:19:03,014
You have to be three times faster
than what you were before.

338
00:19:03,015 --> 00:19:06,090
If you can't do that,
then we'll all fail again.

339
00:19:06,091 --> 00:19:09,506
- You have to be back quicker.
- Our barista was so fast though.

340
00:19:09,507 --> 00:19:11,674
[Kwang Soo and Woo Bin exchange
yet another secret glance.]

341
00:19:11,912 --> 00:19:15,564
- Want me to do it again? I think I can.
- No, we have to take turns.

342
00:19:15,565 --> 00:19:17,294
Fighting!

343
00:19:17,295 --> 00:19:20,602
[We vow to win this time.]

344
00:19:20,603 --> 00:19:23,462
- Take your places under the bar.
- Can we switch places?

345
00:19:24,126 --> 00:19:27,308
[A feisty battle for their spots.]

346
00:19:28,579 --> 00:19:32,147
Your second mission-
While your teammates are hanging from the bar

347
00:19:32,148 --> 00:19:39,358
you have to bring back a foreigner who's here
from a country that's more than 3 syllables.

348
00:19:39,892 --> 00:19:42,822
Bangladesh!
Any foreigners out here?

349
00:19:42,823 --> 00:19:45,163
- Any foreigners!
- Where are you from?

350
00:19:45,164 --> 00:19:47,945
Where are you from!

351
00:19:49,787 --> 00:19:52,077
[As soon as they get on the bar,
Kkuk starts his attack on Big-nose.]

352
00:19:52,078 --> 00:19:54,724
[Jae Suk joins in on the attack.]

353
00:19:54,725 --> 00:19:56,531
You guys are seriously driving me crazy.

354
00:19:56,532 --> 00:20:00,217
[Big-nose is already in danger!]

355
00:20:01,386 --> 00:20:03,978
[The only way to rescue Big-nose from danger
is to complete the mission quickly.]

356
00:20:03,979 --> 00:20:05,576
- Singapore!
- Where are you from?

357
00:20:05,577 --> 00:20:07,344
Singapore?
Where are you from?

358
00:20:07,345 --> 00:20:10,698
- Singapore!
- Is that more than three syllables?

359
00:20:10,699 --> 00:20:12,510
[Singapore is more than three syllables
in Korean language.]

360
00:20:12,511 --> 00:20:14,981
[Team Red successfully finds
their foreigner in the blink of an eye!]

361
00:20:14,982 --> 00:20:18,551
- Excuse me, where are you from?
- Thailand.

362
00:20:18,552 --> 00:20:21,401
- Thailand.
- But that's 'Taegook' in Korean.

363
00:20:21,402 --> 00:20:23,866
Sorry!
I love Thailand!

364
00:20:24,459 --> 00:20:26,900
- Where are you from?
- Taiwan.

365
00:20:27,616 --> 00:20:30,128
[Taiwan is 'Dae-Mon' in Korean,
thus, unacceptable.]

366
00:20:30,129 --> 00:20:32,393
Woo Bin, we have to win this no matter what.

367
00:20:32,394 --> 00:20:34,810
You know that we have to
come in at first place, right?

368
00:20:34,811 --> 00:20:38,124
- Hello, where are you from?
- Where are you from?

369
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:40,788
- Where are you from?
- China.

370
00:20:40,789 --> 00:20:42,662
Okay, I love China.

371
00:20:42,663 --> 00:20:45,247
[Peaceful Giraffe loves the entire world.]

372
00:20:45,248 --> 00:20:48,927
Excuse me!
Excuse me, where are you from?

373
00:20:48,928 --> 00:20:51,138
- England.
- Did you ask what his name was?

374
00:20:51,139 --> 00:20:52,747
- No, his country.
- The country?

375
00:20:52,748 --> 00:20:55,065
[Drags him back to the judging table.]

376
00:20:56,137 --> 00:20:58,257
[Team Red arrives back
almost at the same time.]

377
00:20:58,258 --> 00:21:01,071
[All three are still hanging from the bar.]

378
00:21:02,784 --> 00:21:05,642
[Team Blue and Team Red are almost there.]

379
00:21:05,643 --> 00:21:09,150
[Team Red arrives first
by the split of a hair.]

380
00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:12,723
Where did Woo Bin and Kwang Soo go?

381
00:21:13,379 --> 00:21:16,013
- What's your name?
- Michael.

382
00:21:16,274 --> 00:21:18,484
Michael is from Bazaar.

383
00:21:18,485 --> 00:21:20,662
[Bazaar?]

384
00:21:20,663 --> 00:21:21,944
I love Bazaar.

385
00:21:21,945 --> 00:21:24,472
[Which country is Bazaar?]

386
00:21:26,444 --> 00:21:28,728
Look at how huge Kwang Soo's face looks.

387
00:21:28,729 --> 00:21:31,298
- Did you already fall off?
- Of course! What took you guys so long?

388
00:21:31,674 --> 00:21:34,052
- Where is he from?
- Bazaar?

389
00:21:34,053 --> 00:21:36,164
- What? Bazaar?
- Bazaar.

390
00:21:36,165 --> 00:21:38,548
[Just where in the world is Bazaar?]

391
00:21:38,549 --> 00:21:42,016
- Where are you from?
- Belgium.

392
00:21:42,017 --> 00:21:44,664
Belgium!

393
00:21:44,836 --> 00:21:47,922
[It wasn't Bazaar?]

394
00:21:48,325 --> 00:21:52,146
- He's from Belgium.
- How did you get 'Bazaar' from that?

395
00:21:52,808 --> 00:21:56,698
Even though it is three syllables,
you failed because Jae Suk fell off.

396
00:21:56,699 --> 00:21:58,170
[Team Black fails because
Jae Suk fell off the bar.]

397
00:21:58,171 --> 00:22:04,092
[England is 'Young-Gook' in Korean,
thus, Team Blue also fails.]

398
00:22:04,093 --> 00:22:06,982
In Korean, England is 'Young-Gook.'

399
00:22:09,666 --> 00:22:11,622
- Where is she from?
- Singapore.

400
00:22:12,074 --> 00:22:14,632
- The country of chili crabs.
- But he fell off from the bar.

401
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:19,192
Even though it is three syllables,
you fail because Suk Jin fell off.

402
00:22:19,556 --> 00:22:21,914
[A strong denial.]

403
00:22:22,636 --> 00:22:26,168
[Video replay.]

404
00:22:28,224 --> 00:22:30,976
[Team Red returns after Suk Jin
has already fallen off the bar.]

405
00:22:31,311 --> 00:22:33,099
Ugh, that was so close!

406
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,928
[Five minutes after having said that...]

407
00:22:35,929 --> 00:22:37,779
- I fell off the bar?
- Yes, you did.

408
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:39,932
[Fails the argument.]

409
00:22:39,933 --> 00:22:42,064
- Thank you, it was nice to meet you.
- Thank you, I love Belgium.

410
00:22:42,065 --> 00:22:45,432
[Thanks the foreigners for their
participation in the game.]

411
00:22:45,433 --> 00:22:48,423
[Even takes a picture.]

412
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:52,440
How did you mistake Belgium for Bazaar?

413
00:22:52,441 --> 00:22:55,864
- He should've been more clear.
- He said, Belgium.

414
00:22:55,865 --> 00:22:59,162
- How did you get Bazaar out of that?
- That's what he told me.

415
00:22:59,163 --> 00:23:02,165
- Decide who'll hang on the bar this time.
- It'll be Ji Suk Jin.

416
00:23:02,166 --> 00:23:04,960
- I can't do it.
- You guys need to switch up.

417
00:23:04,961 --> 00:23:08,529
- I'm not lying, it really hurts.
- What do you mean, it's not a lie?

418
00:23:09,559 --> 00:23:12,911
[Hyun Woo takes a turn for Team Blue.]

419
00:23:13,785 --> 00:23:16,009
[Woo Bin takes another turn
for Team Black.]

420
00:23:16,010 --> 00:23:18,099
- I can't run because of my painful knee.
- Stop lying.

421
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:20,386
[Woo Bin is already pulling out the lies.]

422
00:23:20,387 --> 00:23:22,727
- Have you all decided?
- Let's go, Kwang Soo.

423
00:23:22,728 --> 00:23:26,772
Kwang Soo, we have to be quick.
We have to win this time.

424
00:23:26,773 --> 00:23:28,039
[Woo Bin, I'll be right back.]

425
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:30,275
[Kwang Soo, I'll hold on until
you get back.]

426
00:23:30,276 --> 00:23:33,497
While your teammates
are hanging from the bar

427
00:23:33,498 --> 00:23:39,767
buy and bring back an item with
the consonants, D, S, and an R!

428
00:23:39,768 --> 00:23:40,981
Go!

429
00:23:51,506 --> 00:23:53,756
Don't do it!

430
00:23:54,551 --> 00:23:57,105
[Big-nose immediately eliminates
himself from the game.]

431
00:23:57,816 --> 00:24:00,793
[Meanwhile, Woo Bin launches
his attack on Woo Bin.]

432
00:24:00,794 --> 00:24:02,661
Don't do it!

433
00:24:02,662 --> 00:24:04,473
No, don't do it!

434
00:24:07,688 --> 00:24:11,746
Jong Kook!

435
00:24:12,279 --> 00:24:15,297
[Jong Kook is busy carrying out his mission.]

436
00:24:15,298 --> 00:24:19,604
D, S, R...

437
00:24:20,543 --> 00:24:23,765
- Do-Shi-Rak!
- That's it! Doshirak!

438
00:24:23,766 --> 00:24:26,807
[Mr. Capable and Ace do it again!
Off to find a doshirak.]

439
00:24:26,808 --> 00:24:29,781
- We need to find a convenience store!
- What else is there besides doshirak?

440
00:24:29,782 --> 00:24:31,575
[Team Red have also figured out
Doshirak as a possibility...]

441
00:24:31,576 --> 00:24:34,511
[But they're probably unaware that
Big-nose has already eliminated himself?]

442
00:24:36,657 --> 00:24:39,704
Darimi?
- That's not D, S, R.

443
00:24:39,705 --> 00:24:43,176
- How does 'D, S, R' fit into that?
- Okay, you're right.

444
00:24:43,177 --> 00:24:46,368
- Dodari?
- I said, it's 'D, S, R!'

445
00:24:48,242 --> 00:24:51,259
[Yoo-Lee Brothers
can't seem to figure it out.]

446
00:24:52,998 --> 00:24:56,680
[Meanwhile, Woo Bin is getting
quite used to the horizontal bar.]

447
00:24:56,681 --> 00:25:01,665
- You can't be sitting up on the bar.
- I never realized how scary he is.

448
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:04,551
[It's impressive that Hyun Woo
is able to withstand the attack.]

449
00:25:04,552 --> 00:25:07,019
- I'm sorry.
- Hyun Woo is impressive.

450
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:08,205
[I'm sorry, but I really have to win.]

451
00:25:08,206 --> 00:25:11,357
- Are you sure you're friends?
- I really am sorry.

452
00:25:13,194 --> 00:25:16,204
[Once again,
Woo Bin is the lone survivor.]

453
00:25:16,884 --> 00:25:19,658
- When did you fall off?
- I never even made it up.

454
00:25:19,659 --> 00:25:22,962
- I didn't even see you fall off.
- I never made it up.

455
00:25:22,963 --> 00:25:26,624
- You should've helped me.
- But I never even made it up there.

456
00:25:27,022 --> 00:25:29,711
Where is it?
Where's Doshirak!

457
00:25:29,712 --> 00:25:32,557
[Must find a doshirak!]

458
00:25:32,896 --> 00:25:34,902
There's a convenience store!

459
00:25:34,903 --> 00:25:36,484
There it is!

460
00:25:37,892 --> 00:25:39,924
[Hurry back!]

461
00:25:39,925 --> 00:25:41,965
Do you have any ideas on
how we can make him fall off?

462
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:45,316
- What do you think?
- Let's take off his shoes and tickle him.

463
00:25:47,228 --> 00:25:49,444
[Woo Bin in danger!]

464
00:25:49,445 --> 00:25:53,377
- Just come down here, Woo Bin.
- I've hung on this long.

465
00:25:53,378 --> 00:25:56,318
- I can't even see anyone right now.
- You're just exhausting yourself.

466
00:25:57,758 --> 00:26:01,230
[Team Black searches for their Doshirak
at the convenience store.]

467
00:26:01,231 --> 00:26:04,470
Why are you even searching through?
Just pick whatever.

468
00:26:04,471 --> 00:26:05,693
[Chooses the chicken doshirak,
of his own preference.]

469
00:26:06,801 --> 00:26:09,346
[Must rush back to the judging table!]

470
00:26:09,347 --> 00:26:12,734
- I hope he's still hanging on.
- Just bring back a doshirak!

471
00:26:15,568 --> 00:26:20,080
[Team Blue and Team Red give up
and make their way back.]

472
00:26:20,690 --> 00:26:24,232
- You can find them at convenience stores.
- What about a Dok-Su-Ri? (An eagle)

473
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:26,937
[Where are they going to find an eagle
in Myungdong?]

474
00:26:27,587 --> 00:26:30,131
[I'm going to hold on
no matter what it takes.]

475
00:26:30,132 --> 00:26:32,317
Woo Bin, you're just wasting
your efforts.

476
00:26:33,474 --> 00:26:35,732
[Just then...]

477
00:26:35,733 --> 00:26:39,437
[Woo Bin, we're coming for you!]

478
00:26:40,714 --> 00:26:44,111
[Rushes back with a doshirak in hand.]

479
00:26:44,112 --> 00:26:46,488
- What's this?
- It's a doshirak.

480
00:26:46,489 --> 00:26:49,331
- This isn't a doshirak.
- You guys be the judge.

481
00:26:49,332 --> 00:26:53,451
- That's not a doshirak.
- It's not even written on there.

482
00:26:53,452 --> 00:26:55,677
[Leaving it to the producer to judge.]

483
00:26:56,485 --> 00:26:58,906
Jae Suk said the chicken one is tasty.

484
00:26:58,907 --> 00:27:01,943
[Woo Bin comes back down after
seeing the doshirak in their hands.]

485
00:27:01,944 --> 00:27:04,967
Yoo Jae Suk, Lee Kwang Soo,
and Kim Woo Bin...

486
00:27:06,128 --> 00:27:07,472
you succeeded your mission.

487
00:27:07,473 --> 00:27:09,225
[Team Black succeeds their mission.]

488
00:27:09,226 --> 00:27:13,526
[A victory won from Woo Bin's power,
and Jae Suk and Kwang Soo's speed.]

489
00:27:15,248 --> 00:27:19,487
As mentioned, you've earned yourselves
an important item for the final mission.

490
00:27:20,306 --> 00:27:22,421
This is for you,
and your next mission site.

491
00:27:22,422 --> 00:27:24,762
- Here.
- Thank you.

492
00:27:24,763 --> 00:27:26,272
[This is the clue to the final mission,
and the tool for ousting other members.]

493
00:27:26,724 --> 00:27:30,564
He's really merciless.
He was just ruthless.

494
00:27:32,058 --> 00:27:33,929
He's really merciless.

495
00:27:37,788 --> 00:27:40,153
[Shakes his fans' hands
as a service.]

496
00:27:40,154 --> 00:27:43,538
- Wow, how did you last up there?
- It wasn't easy.

497
00:27:43,539 --> 00:27:45,795
[Amazed that Woo Bin held on
until they returned.]

498
00:27:46,768 --> 00:27:50,897
- Wow, it's Kim Woo Bin!
- Yes, I'm Yoo Jae Suk.

499
00:27:52,259 --> 00:27:54,781
[Unsolicited greeting to Woo Bin's fans.]

500
00:27:54,782 --> 00:27:56,901
They were shouting out
Woo Bin's name.

501
00:27:57,281 --> 00:27:59,387
Yes, I'm Yoo Jae Suk.

502
00:27:59,388 --> 00:28:02,711
[Okay, we've got one under our belt.]

503
00:28:03,573 --> 00:28:05,617
[Off to the next mission site.]

504
00:28:06,715 --> 00:28:09,712
- What's the clue?
- Kwang Soo, let's take a look at the hint.

505
00:28:15,721 --> 00:28:18,006
[Pens!]

506
00:28:18,937 --> 00:28:20,859
- What is it?
- What are these pens for?

507
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:22,285
[The bag is full of a variety of pens.]

508
00:28:22,919 --> 00:28:25,965
- This must be the hint.
- Why are there so many pens?

509
00:28:26,311 --> 00:28:29,151
[Pens...]

510
00:28:30,053 --> 00:28:32,570
Kwang Soo, if we win
the missions along the way

511
00:28:32,571 --> 00:28:35,556
they'll give us the tools that we'll need
to oust the other members.

512
00:28:35,557 --> 00:28:37,835
Pens or something of the like?

513
00:28:38,207 --> 00:28:42,182
I can hear the producers muttering
as soon as I said the word, 'pen.'

514
00:28:42,183 --> 00:28:45,047
[Kwang Soo's guess that took
the producers by surprise.]

515
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:48,140
They're going on and on
about how smart I am.

516
00:28:48,141 --> 00:28:52,833
[Could he... really be that smart?]

517
00:28:52,834 --> 00:28:54,786
- Why are there so many pens?
- There are about a hundred in here.

518
00:28:54,787 --> 00:28:58,909
[Over a hundred pens are in the bag.]

519
00:28:58,910 --> 00:29:00,853
Why are there so many pens?

520
00:29:00,854 --> 00:29:05,928
[What is the hidden meaning of these pens?]

521
00:29:06,978 --> 00:29:09,829
['K' cafe in Hannamdong.]

522
00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:11,538
What is this?

523
00:29:11,539 --> 00:29:15,311
[What is the meaning of this setup?]

524
00:29:15,312 --> 00:29:18,140
- What is this?
- Sorry, but Woo Bin goes in the middle.

525
00:29:19,426 --> 00:29:22,076
- What does that even matter?
- Woo Bin goes in the middle.

526
00:29:22,077 --> 00:29:24,659
[Woo Bin belongs in the center
of this team.]

527
00:29:25,325 --> 00:29:27,712
- I'm older than him.
- But he still belongs in the middle.

528
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:32,995
Since you're the first to arrive,
you automatically move onto the final round.

529
00:29:32,996 --> 00:29:34,629
[Team Black moves onto the final round
for being the first to arrive.]

530
00:29:35,729 --> 00:29:39,376
[Team Red arrives behind them
by the split of a hair.]

531
00:29:39,377 --> 00:29:41,868
- We arrived at the same time.
- This is great!

532
00:29:43,217 --> 00:29:45,407
[Things are going well as planned.]

533
00:29:45,408 --> 00:29:48,283
- What is this?
- What is this?

534
00:29:48,284 --> 00:29:50,279
- What is this for?
- Is it the cookie eating game?

535
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:55,047
- Second mission is, the staring game.
- Okay, I know this one.

536
00:29:55,048 --> 00:29:57,103
- It requires skills.
- I'm really good at this.

537
00:29:57,104 --> 00:30:00,126
- You are?
- I'm good at the staring game.

538
00:30:00,578 --> 00:30:04,813
These two have never lost a single game
when it comes to the staring game.

539
00:30:05,132 --> 00:30:07,876
I haven't once blinked my eyes
in the past twelve years.

540
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:15,290
[That's a very easy
twelve year record to break.]

541
00:30:15,291 --> 00:30:18,804
- You just made him break his 12 year record.
- I just broke his 12 year record.

542
00:30:18,805 --> 00:30:20,670
[How about Woo Bin's skills?]

543
00:30:20,671 --> 00:30:22,278
This game is very advantageous
for Jong Kook.

544
00:30:22,279 --> 00:30:25,552
You really have to look closely when checking
to see whether his eyes are open or shut.

545
00:30:25,967 --> 00:30:28,423
How would you know that?

546
00:30:28,834 --> 00:30:32,323
He was watching a movie on the plane and
a stewardess covered him up with a blanket.

547
00:30:32,975 --> 00:30:36,800
- No, that really happened.
- Because it was dark in there.

548
00:30:36,801 --> 00:30:39,957
- Because it was dark in there.
- You have to look at him closely.

549
00:30:39,958 --> 00:30:46,667
[Installing the boards to hide their faces
from their opponents.]

550
00:30:46,668 --> 00:30:48,968
[Break through these boards and
start the staring game simultaneously.]

551
00:30:48,969 --> 00:30:51,522
- I blink all the time as a habit.
- He's not good at this game.

552
00:30:51,523 --> 00:30:54,246
[First round-
Ha Ha vs Kim Jong Kook.]

553
00:30:54,247 --> 00:30:56,530
Wow, you really are so ugly.

554
00:30:56,531 --> 00:30:58,428
[Ha Ha's specialty,
Rolling his eyes backwards.]

555
00:30:59,527 --> 00:31:02,422
- How did you get so ugly?
- You're ugly, too.

556
00:31:02,423 --> 00:31:06,244
- You've gotten even uglier.
- You look like a beltfish.

557
00:31:06,245 --> 00:31:08,854
- You're seriously really ugly.
- You're no joke either.

558
00:31:08,855 --> 00:31:12,225
- Kwang Soo, say something to him.
- You're both ugly.

559
00:31:13,095 --> 00:31:16,386
- Don't talk about your looks.
- You're all squids in front of Woo Bin.

560
00:31:16,387 --> 00:31:19,471
I'm being serious when I say that I'm one
of the two best looking on this show.

561
00:31:19,472 --> 00:31:21,042
What a joke!

562
00:31:21,043 --> 00:31:23,685
- What a joke!
- What is he saying?

563
00:31:24,072 --> 00:31:28,764
[Where in the world did his sense
of self-confidence come from?]

564
00:31:28,765 --> 00:31:31,455
You should just be quiet about your
ugliness like Gary is being.

565
00:31:31,961 --> 00:31:34,309
Why are you bringing me
into this conversation?

566
00:31:34,685 --> 00:31:36,725
- He's not even saying anything.
- I didn't say anything.

567
00:31:36,726 --> 00:31:39,324
- Get ready.
- Don't forget to make that face.

568
00:31:39,325 --> 00:31:40,655
Set...

569
00:31:40,656 --> 00:31:43,210
[Staring game- Ha Ha vs Kim Jong Kook.]

570
00:31:50,079 --> 00:31:52,923
[Eyes rolled back vs Sleepy eyes.]

571
00:31:54,093 --> 00:31:56,803
[A battle between the small eyes.]

572
00:31:58,347 --> 00:32:01,106
[An example of a soundless scream.]

573
00:32:01,486 --> 00:32:04,327
- Wow, he's seriously so ugly.
- Jong Kook's eyes are starting to tear up.

574
00:32:04,846 --> 00:32:06,870
[Jong Kook's small eyes are in danger!]

575
00:32:07,454 --> 00:32:11,988
Do you like Yoon Eun Hye better,
or Moon Geun Young better?

576
00:32:16,476 --> 00:32:18,560
Wow, my eyes are stinging.

577
00:32:18,845 --> 00:32:21,696
[Ha Ha's in danger!]

578
00:32:22,446 --> 00:32:24,167
[He's holding on!]

579
00:32:30,252 --> 00:32:33,307
[Kim Jong Kook wins the first round!]

580
00:32:34,781 --> 00:32:36,937
- Wow, my eyes are really stinging.
- Did you lose?

581
00:32:39,501 --> 00:32:42,757
[What was it that you said earlier?]

582
00:32:43,525 --> 00:32:46,440
- I was just curious.
- Why would you ask that?

583
00:32:46,441 --> 00:32:49,093
[Staring Game-
Team Red: 0 vs Team Blue: 1.]

584
00:32:49,752 --> 00:32:51,354
Do something with my hair
to make me look ugly.

585
00:32:51,355 --> 00:32:54,572
- No, you're fine as you are.
- You know that puzzle?

586
00:32:54,573 --> 00:32:56,010
The squid puzzle?

587
00:32:56,011 --> 00:32:57,414
- What is that?
- You don't know it?

588
00:32:57,415 --> 00:33:01,042
You put pictures of all the good looking
guys like Woo Bin around the edges

589
00:33:01,043 --> 00:33:03,548
and whomever you put in the middle
becomes the squid.

590
00:33:03,850 --> 00:33:08,009
Can you pull that up on screen?
These guys need to be put up there.

591
00:33:11,574 --> 00:33:14,276
You look like a squid even
when you're just standing there.

592
00:33:17,281 --> 00:33:19,309
Put Ha Ha in the puzzle, too.

593
00:33:22,137 --> 00:33:25,804
- Dried cuttlefish shouldn't talk.
- I thought he was an alien.

594
00:33:25,805 --> 00:33:28,563
- Dried cuttlefish?
- Or like a baby squid.

595
00:33:28,564 --> 00:33:31,519
- King squid, say something.
- Why am I getting pulled into this?

596
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:35,101
- I don't want to get pulled into this!
- The King Squid should say something.

597
00:33:35,575 --> 00:33:38,117
Why aren't you saying anything?

598
00:33:38,823 --> 00:33:41,917
[Round Two- Gary vs. Jong Kook.]

599
00:33:41,918 --> 00:33:43,965
Gary, you're already funny
even without having to do all that.

600
00:33:43,966 --> 00:33:45,447
Ready, go!

601
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:56,231
Roll your eyes back.
There you go.

602

Ouch, my eyes are already stinging!
They're stinging already!

603

I can't do this!

604
00:34:02,278 --> 00:34:04,399
- I can't do this!
- You have to endure it.

[You have to endure it!]

606

Wow, my eyes are really stinging.

615
00:34:37,381 --> 00:34:40,412
Isn't he awesome?
Isn't my Gary so ugly?

the Monday Couple's battle.]

[The final round that will determine
who will go on to the playoff round.]

618
00:34:48,643 --> 00:34:50,597
- Okay, next.
- Ji Hyo.

- I don't know about Ji Hyo.
- Win the game, and win the love.

622

- Just know that she likes you.
- Set, go!

[Blank Ji will never back down!]

624

I don't think I can even look at her.

What are you two doing?

626
00:35:22,222 --> 00:35:23,844
Don't fall for it!

627
00:35:23,845 --> 00:35:25,425
[This is child's play.]

628
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:27,903

through his screen!]

- Do it back to her!
- Do it!

634
00:35:56,254 --> 00:35:58,771

[Flutters her eyes shut
without even realizing it.]

639
00:36:13,053 --> 00:36:15,006
That's because Ji Hyo really likes Gary.

- Things are heating up again.
- Ji Hyo, is this our beginning?

641

still counting for the Monday Couple.]

[First round of the playoffs-
Suk Jin vs Jae Suk.]

645
00:36:31,513 --> 00:36:33,357
We should paint something on.

Do you have the pen on you?

647
00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:39,224
[The pens that they received in the bag
after having won the first mission.]

648

[We're going to have to do
something, too...]

653
00:36:54,547 --> 00:36:56,708
Hand me some tape.

654
00:36:56,709 --> 00:36:59,149
- Let's see who wins.
- Fine.

655
00:37:00,047 --> 00:37:03,948
[Becoming extremely competitive.]

656
00:37:03,949 --> 00:37:06,066
Yeah, go for the clippers.

657
00:37:08,537 --> 00:37:10,294
Don't go too overboard.

658
00:37:17,256 --> 00:37:19,168
I think they're doing something.

659
00:37:20,104 --> 00:37:21,884
I was going to do that, too.

660
00:37:23,184 --> 00:37:26,215
[The breathtaking behind.]

661
00:37:26,884 --> 00:37:29,914
[We can't let them win!
Jae Suk also goes for the tape.]

662
00:37:29,915 --> 00:37:32,698
- Are you sure about taping the hair?
- It's okay.

663
00:37:35,114 --> 00:37:38,692
- Wait!
- Kwang Soo, this is how you do it.

664
00:37:38,693 --> 00:37:41,120
- Why are you going this far?
- Because this is what I need to do.

665
00:37:43,404 --> 00:37:45,711
Big-nose is breaking out the big guns.

666
00:37:45,712 --> 00:37:49,758
[Big-nose's counterattack vs
Jae Suk's forestallment.]

667
00:37:50,764 --> 00:37:53,446
[Suk Jin vs Jae Suk.]

668
00:37:59,821 --> 00:38:02,288
[A shocking visual.]

669
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:08,966
[Pretty close.]

670
00:38:08,967 --> 00:38:10,751
I thought this was just a
staring contest!

671
00:38:10,752 --> 00:38:12,812
[A slapstick comedy that's disguised
as being a staring contest.]

672
00:38:13,169 --> 00:38:16,140
[I vow to win this!]

673
00:38:16,712 --> 00:38:18,524
Kwang Soo, pull it back even more.

674
00:38:20,896 --> 00:38:24,428
- Pull it back more.
- Tape it more.

675
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:38,224
[Ji Suk Jin wins the first round.]

676
00:38:40,663 --> 00:38:44,427
- Why did you pull that hard!
- You told me to do it!

677
00:38:44,428 --> 00:38:46,704
[A painful loss.]

678
00:38:48,518 --> 00:38:50,692
[Big-nose sacrifices his dignity
for the win.]

679
00:38:50,693 --> 00:38:52,330
Woo Bin is up next.

680
00:38:52,331 --> 00:38:54,391
- I feel burdened by it.
- Do you think you can do it?

681
00:38:56,073 --> 00:39:00,466
- You need to protect Woo Bin.
- I think he's eager to win.

682
00:39:00,467 --> 00:39:01,919
[I have to win to earn the next clue.]

683
00:39:02,038 --> 00:39:04,902
You can use the tape on me.

684
00:39:05,829 --> 00:39:07,882
Put it back really hard.

685
00:39:10,715 --> 00:39:14,486
[Handsome Woo Bin said
he wants to do it.]

686
00:39:14,914 --> 00:39:17,195
That's enough.

687
00:39:17,903 --> 00:39:21,617
[Turn my mouth to the side, too.]

688
00:39:25,376 --> 00:39:28,954
- Don't do it!
- No, that's good.

689
00:39:29,805 --> 00:39:32,717
[Woo Bin, we have to
win this no matter what.]

690
00:39:34,117 --> 00:39:37,743
[Team Red is convinced that they'll win
with Gary's transformation.]

691
00:39:37,744 --> 00:39:40,020
- That's awesome, Gary.
- Ready.

692
00:39:40,021 --> 00:39:42,487
[Round two- Gary vs Woo Bin.]

693
00:39:44,915 --> 00:39:47,129
[Where did your eyebrows go?]

694
00:39:52,089 --> 00:39:55,279
[Where did Woo Bin go?]

695
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:58,533
What is this!

696
00:39:58,887 --> 00:40:00,899
[He even flips his eyes around.]

697
00:40:04,928 --> 00:40:07,891
[Woo Bin is determined to win!]

698
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:11,856
Endure it.
You're ugly and you can win this.

699
00:40:11,857 --> 00:40:14,364
My eyes hurt!

700
00:40:17,181 --> 00:40:21,647
[Kim Woo Bin wins the second round.]

701
00:40:22,421 --> 00:40:24,432
[Shocked at Woo Bin's performance.]

702
00:40:24,867 --> 00:40:26,961
[Woo Bin dedicates himself
to the win.]

703
00:40:26,962 --> 00:40:31,303
This team is very strong.
They've got too big of an advantage.

704
00:40:31,304 --> 00:40:33,774
[Team Black wins the second mission.]

705
00:40:33,775 --> 00:40:37,378
- We're confident that we'll win it all!
- This is my favorite game!

706
00:40:37,379 --> 00:40:39,909
- That's right.
- My family played it just this morning.

707
00:40:41,372 --> 00:40:44,321
- Who won this morning?
- My mother won.

708
00:40:48,104 --> 00:40:50,157
My parents are still laughing
about it.

709
00:40:50,158 --> 00:40:52,199
[Mission two, clear!]

710
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:55,964
[Let's put our strengths together
and win the last mission, too!]

711
00:40:56,980 --> 00:41:01,851
You've won yourselves another hint for
having won the second mission.

712
00:41:01,852 --> 00:41:03,717
- Thank you.
- I'll carry it.

713
00:41:03,718 --> 00:41:05,249
Let's go.

714
00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:08,444
[Kwang Soo and Woo Bin
take both the hints.]

715
00:41:12,830 --> 00:41:15,119
I haven't been here in a long time.

716
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:17,833
[Seoul's National Museum.]

717
00:41:18,408 --> 00:41:25,680
[The members enter the treasure filled
museum with trepidation in their hearts.]

718
00:41:25,681 --> 00:41:30,308
[Scatters about as soon as
they enter the museum.]

719
00:41:34,313 --> 00:41:36,776
Isn't this what we wore during
the opening?

720
00:41:36,777 --> 00:41:39,475
[The black shirts they wore during
the opening are scattered about.]

721
00:41:39,476 --> 00:41:41,261
Are you going to film me
changing my shirt?

722
00:41:43,144 --> 00:41:45,543
What are we going to do
after we change?

723
00:41:48,695 --> 00:41:51,376
[Sound for an announcement.]

724
00:41:51,377 --> 00:41:54,760
<i>Here's your final mission of the day.</i>

725
00:41:55,474 --> 00:41:58,154
<i>Find the ancient script.</i>

726
00:41:58,155 --> 00:42:01,602
[Final mission-
Find the ancient script.]

727
00:42:01,603 --> 00:42:05,382
From this moment on,
it'll be an individual game.

728
00:42:06,626 --> 00:42:14,166
<i>Piece together the parchment papers hidden
throughout this place and find the script.</i>

729
00:42:14,167 --> 00:42:20,022
<i>Only one name can be written into the script,
and whoever writes their name in it</i>

730
00:42:20,023 --> 00:42:22,760
<i>will win the whole race.</i>

731
00:42:22,761 --> 00:42:28,480
<i>A great secret is hidden behind the clues
that were earned after each previous mission</i>

732
00:42:28,481 --> 00:42:31,131
<i>so take good care of
the clues earned.</i>

733
00:42:32,402 --> 00:42:34,854
What the heck?
My other teammates took the hints.

734
00:42:34,855 --> 00:42:36,200
[I'm in trouble.]

735
00:42:36,201 --> 00:42:41,841
<i>Keep in mind that the hint items earned
can be taken from one another.</i>

736
00:42:42,503 --> 00:42:45,071
We will now start the final mission.

737
00:42:45,072 --> 00:42:50,447
[Ancient script mission- Start.]

738
00:42:50,448 --> 00:42:52,879
What the heck?
I thought we were all on the same team.

739
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,946
[The method of elimination is
still shrouded in a cloud of mystery.]

740
00:42:54,947 --> 00:42:57,103
What's in the second bag?

741
00:42:57,104 --> 00:43:00,241
I need to meet up with
Kwang Soo and Woo Bin.

742
00:43:00,242 --> 00:43:02,055
[Jae Suk's plan is to meet up with
Kwang Soo and Woo Bin first.]

743
00:43:02,056 --> 00:43:05,849
[But those two are already
in the know.]

744
00:43:05,850 --> 00:43:08,467
<i>There's information that an ancient
script will be revealed tonight.</i>

745
00:43:08,468 --> 00:43:13,504
[The two men have been working towards
a secret mission since this morning.]

746
00:43:13,505 --> 00:43:19,901
[The secret deal to eliminate the others
to take the ancient script for themselves.]

747
00:43:19,902 --> 00:43:24,412
[And...]

748
00:43:24,413 --> 00:43:27,800
[The reasons for them having given
their best to the missions all day...]

749
00:43:27,801 --> 00:43:34,115
[Is because of the mysterious item that
is hidden in this bag.]

750
00:43:36,173 --> 00:43:40,817
[A secret mission is handed to these two only
after the rules of the game are announced.]

751
00:43:40,818 --> 00:43:43,034
You're a spy.

752
00:43:43,035 --> 00:43:47,357
[You're a spy.]

753
00:43:50,542 --> 00:43:55,286
[And the method of elimination that
only these two spies are privy to.]

754
00:43:55,287 --> 00:43:59,975
[Name tag writing.]

755
00:43:59,976 --> 00:44:07,959
[Oust the members by finding blank name tags
and writing their names on it.]

756
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:12,184
- We don't need to do that anymore.
- That was always so barbaric.

757
00:44:12,701 --> 00:44:15,266
This method is so much easier
and dignified.

758
00:44:15,267 --> 00:44:19,373
[Will it be as simple as they thought
and will it be how it'll be carried on?]

759
00:44:19,374 --> 00:44:25,909
[Spies- Oust the seven members by writing
their names onto the blank name tags.]

760
00:44:25,910 --> 00:44:28,497
[But there is a condition.]

761
00:44:28,498 --> 00:44:33,692
[But it must be written on a designated tag
with the corresponding pen for it to work.]

762
00:44:33,693 --> 00:44:37,016
[Designated name tag?]

763
00:44:37,017 --> 00:44:41,491
[Write it on the wrong name tag, and
you'll be the one to get ousted instead.]

764
00:44:42,052 --> 00:44:47,948
The location of the script will be revealed to
you letter by letter after each elimination.

765
00:44:47,949 --> 00:44:49,555
[The location of the script will be revealed
letter by letter after each elimination.]

766
00:44:49,556 --> 00:44:54,106
[These countless pens are
all designated to a certain tag?]

767
00:44:54,107 --> 00:44:56,373
There's an extra 'R' sticker
on this one.

768
00:44:56,374 --> 00:44:59,887
Wait, why is the word, 'pen'...

769
00:45:00,811 --> 00:45:02,766
This one is written differently.

770
00:45:04,369 --> 00:45:06,692
I wonder if it was written with
a paintbrush.

771
00:45:09,108 --> 00:45:11,736
Okay, so we can't use just
any pen for this.

772
00:45:11,737 --> 00:45:13,414
[Must use the correct pen for
the elimination to take effect.]

773
00:45:13,415 --> 00:45:14,832
I've already taken out a few pens.

774
00:45:16,604 --> 00:45:18,818
I wonder if it's this one.

775
00:45:19,922 --> 00:45:22,642
[This brush pen...]

776
00:45:22,643 --> 00:45:26,285
[Is the correct pen!]

777
00:45:28,695 --> 00:45:31,520
I just need to keep this one out.

778
00:45:31,521 --> 00:45:33,536
[He didn't think that pen was special
when he originally took it out!]

779
00:45:33,537 --> 00:45:36,278
I just took it out
because I liked how it wrote.

780
00:45:36,279 --> 00:45:38,070
I write really well with these pens.

781
00:45:38,577 --> 00:45:40,750
I wasn't even thinking anything of it.

782
00:45:41,787 --> 00:45:47,272
[That was the pen used to transform
Jae Suk's face earlier.]

783
00:45:47,632 --> 00:45:50,634
This is why that word
was written in differently.

784
00:45:50,635 --> 00:45:52,578
[The brush pen is the only effective
one out of this whole lot.]

785
00:45:54,612 --> 00:45:58,742
[Let's hide the pen and
get this started!]

786
00:45:59,152 --> 00:46:01,555
Take it!
We have to take it from them!

787
00:46:02,158 --> 00:46:04,966
- Let's take their hints away from them!
- We have to take it from them.

788
00:46:04,967 --> 00:46:08,130
- Can we do it together?
- Who was on that team again?

789
00:46:08,131 --> 00:46:10,760
- Woo Bin, Jae Suk, and Kwang Soo.
- That's right.

790
00:46:11,091 --> 00:46:14,231
I need to find Kwang Soo
and Woo Bin first.

791
00:46:15,445 --> 00:46:20,292
[Kwang Soo's plan is to entice
Mr. Capable over to his side first.]

792
00:46:20,293 --> 00:46:24,329
[Secretly approaches Jong Kook with
an offer to show him what's inside the bag.]

793
00:46:27,072 --> 00:46:29,858
[Opens the bag to show him all the pens.]

794
00:46:31,334 --> 00:46:33,955
I think we're supposed to use these
and do something with them.

795
00:46:33,956 --> 00:46:35,095
[But the effective pen is hidden
inside Kwang Soo's sock.]

796
00:46:35,096 --> 00:46:37,541
Ugh, you startled me.

797
00:46:37,542 --> 00:46:41,974
[Hyun Woo finds them, and
joins the group.]

798
00:46:41,975 --> 00:46:44,264
- I smelled something.
- Smell what?

799
00:46:44,265 --> 00:46:47,206
I could smell you guys.

800
00:46:47,207 --> 00:46:49,689
[Young Hyun Woo sniffed out the hint.]

801
00:46:49,690 --> 00:46:51,682
You really startled me.

802
00:46:51,683 --> 00:46:54,455
- Can I be included in this?
- Have you found anything?

803
00:46:54,456 --> 00:46:59,156
- I just found it right here.
- This is what I earned earlier.

804
00:46:59,521 --> 00:47:04,495
The reason why I told you this was to ask
that you don't try to overpower me.

805
00:47:04,496 --> 00:47:06,701
Then I promise not to overpower you
with my strength either.

806
00:47:07,227 --> 00:47:08,996
Do you want to die?

807
00:47:11,937 --> 00:47:15,737
[Hyun Woo's adorable antics.]

808
00:47:16,572 --> 00:47:19,501
- You know that this is an individual race?
- Of course, I know.

809
00:47:19,502 --> 00:47:24,893
[Kwang Soo is in need of allies, and
gains Hyun Woo and Kkuk on his side.]

810
00:47:24,894 --> 00:47:27,327
- Us three are the right amount.
- Yes, four would be too many.

811
00:47:28,703 --> 00:47:32,357
- You have to get in the right line.
- Yes, I know. The right line.

812
00:47:32,915 --> 00:47:37,327
- Are you getting in this line, too?
- No, you're both getting in my line.

813
00:47:37,328 --> 00:47:39,445
- Just for today. That's right.
- Like this?

814
00:47:39,446 --> 00:47:41,835
[Let's just win this thing and
take care of the consequences later.]

815
00:47:42,366 --> 00:47:46,035
- I think he's acting too cocky.
- Maybe I should snap the rope off.

816
00:47:47,217 --> 00:47:49,014
Why would you do such a thing?

817
00:47:49,371 --> 00:47:51,038
I feel something here.

818
00:47:51,817 --> 00:47:54,302
<i>We just have to look for
the blank name tags.</i>

819
00:47:54,303 --> 00:47:57,714
[Woo Bin searches for the blank name tags
while others search for the parchment paper.]

820
00:47:57,884 --> 00:48:01,578
[Oust the other members by writing down
their names onto the designated name tags.]

821
00:48:01,579 --> 00:48:07,599
[Oust all the other members in order to
find out where the script is being kept!]

822
00:48:10,809 --> 00:48:13,478
[Just then.]

823
00:48:15,536 --> 00:48:19,779
[A name tag is discovered.]

824
00:48:22,784 --> 00:48:29,207
[But... who's name should he write?]

825
00:48:31,255 --> 00:48:34,093
- Kwang Soo, where are you?
- Between the second and the third floor.

826
00:48:35,621 --> 00:48:40,925
[The two spies meet up away
from other members' eyes.]

827
00:48:44,548 --> 00:48:48,265
[Woo Bin shows Kwang Soo
the name tag he found.]

828
00:48:49,238 --> 00:48:52,923
[Whose name should they
write on the tag?]

829
00:48:52,924 --> 00:48:56,601
We'll be the ones to get ousted unless
we write down the correct name on here.

830
00:48:56,602 --> 00:48:58,419
Yes, but who?

831
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,951
Just write down whomever on it first.

832
00:49:04,166 --> 00:49:06,585
- This is all you found? No clues?
- That's right.

833
00:49:06,586 --> 00:49:10,519
We have like a hundred pens,
so can we just use whatever?

834
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:13,320
No, you need to use the right pen.

835
00:49:13,321 --> 00:49:15,570
[Kwang Soo is already aware that
only the brush pen can be used.]

836
00:49:17,274 --> 00:49:20,595
- Tell me.
- I can't figure that part out.

837
00:49:22,387 --> 00:49:27,255
You... why is it that I can't even
tell my own partner about it?

838
00:49:27,256 --> 00:49:29,088
[Remains competitive with his
own teammate.]

839
00:49:29,089 --> 00:49:31,339
Give me some time.
Give me about three seconds.

840
00:49:36,015 --> 00:49:38,390
Keep this up, and
I'll write down your name.

841
00:49:38,391 --> 00:49:41,096
I'll just try every one of these pens.

842
00:49:45,715 --> 00:49:48,228
Here's the right pen.

843
00:49:50,291 --> 00:49:52,515
- I have one, too.
- Pull the cap off.

844
00:49:52,516 --> 00:49:54,501
That's the one.

845
00:49:55,044 --> 00:49:57,611
- Is this the only one that works?
- Yes, why?

846
00:49:57,612 --> 00:50:02,358
When we first received the mission...
Must I teach you everything?

847
00:50:02,799 --> 00:50:04,981
We're on the same team!

848
00:50:04,982 --> 00:50:07,731
[The dumb and dumber spies are wasting
precious time with their conversation.]

849
00:50:07,732 --> 00:50:12,121
Only this word is written
with a different writing utensil.

850
00:50:14,194 --> 00:50:16,575
Smarter than what you expected,
aren't I?

851
00:50:16,576 --> 00:50:18,740
[Cocky...]

852
00:50:19,573 --> 00:50:22,338
[You sure are a smart cookie...]

853
00:50:22,339 --> 00:50:25,780
- You really got lucky with your partner.
- Do you feel how sweaty my palm is?

854
00:50:26,544 --> 00:50:30,746
[The Spy Brothers are back in the game.]

855
00:50:33,236 --> 00:50:36,226
Pull out all the right pens
and hide them in your clothes.

856
00:50:36,227 --> 00:50:38,464
[Woo Bin pulls out all the pens
and sticks them in his pockets.]

857
00:50:38,465 --> 00:50:43,776
[And places eye catching pens
in their back pockets.]

858
00:50:46,488 --> 00:50:53,326
[But... wo's name will go on
this name tag?]

859
00:50:54,026 --> 00:50:57,204
- Jong Kook, he was trying to steal my pens.
- Seriously?

860
00:50:57,205 --> 00:50:58,981
- Seriously?
- He was seriously going to take it.

861
00:50:58,982 --> 00:51:01,647
[Kwang Soo is telling his recent partner,
Jae Suk, on Jong Kook.]

862
00:51:01,648 --> 00:51:04,355
- He was seriously trying to take it.
- What are you doing?

863
00:51:04,356 --> 00:51:07,487
- Were you trying to take it?
- You're stealing from your own teammate?

864
00:51:07,488 --> 00:51:10,763
- Seriously...
- Did you see how he was talking to me?

865
00:51:10,764 --> 00:51:12,913
He's pointing his finger in my face.

866
00:51:13,693 --> 00:51:15,585
Please watch yourself.

867
00:51:16,879 --> 00:51:20,532
[The young bodyguard tries
to act tough.]

868
00:51:20,533 --> 00:51:25,172
- We're over.
- You have to go through these two first.

869
00:51:25,173 --> 00:51:26,884
[Kwang Soo is relying on
Kkuk's shield.]

870
00:51:26,885 --> 00:51:29,798
- Can I say something to him?
- Sure, go ahead.

871
00:51:30,486 --> 00:51:32,960
- Don't step too close to him.
- Okay, just one word.

872
00:51:32,961 --> 00:51:35,788
[Gets Kkuk's permission
to slap him in the face.]

873
00:51:38,354 --> 00:51:41,406
That's all I wanted to say to him.

874
00:51:42,135 --> 00:51:44,284
I understood what you're saying.

875
00:51:45,954 --> 00:51:48,940
Where are the parchment papers?

876
00:51:48,941 --> 00:51:50,935
[Ji Hyo is searching
for the parchment papers.]

877
00:51:53,378 --> 00:51:56,196
[Searching through every
nook and cranny.]

878
00:51:59,906 --> 00:52:02,530
[Discovers an 'R' marked parchment paper.]

879
00:52:02,975 --> 00:52:07,096
Wow, that wasn't easy to find.

880
00:52:07,628 --> 00:52:09,748
[What information is hidden
in this piece of parchment?]

881
00:52:09,749 --> 00:52:14,722
[There's a spy hidden amongst you.]

882
00:52:14,757 --> 00:52:16,532
Unbelievable.

883
00:52:16,533 --> 00:52:18,498
[Blank Ji finds out that there's a spy!]

884
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:24,530
[But their identities
still remain a mystery.]

885
00:52:24,531 --> 00:52:26,332
Who could it be?

886
00:52:26,333 --> 00:52:27,806
[Who could it be?]

887
00:52:28,462 --> 00:52:30,540
Have you found anything?

888
00:52:34,085 --> 00:52:36,666
- What are you doing?
- Have you found anything?

889
00:52:36,667 --> 00:52:39,316
[What's wrong with Ji Hyo?]

890
00:52:39,966 --> 00:52:42,987
I don't have anything to share with you.

891
00:52:42,988 --> 00:52:44,954
- I did find something.
- You did?

892
00:52:44,955 --> 00:52:46,596
You're lying.

893
00:52:46,597 --> 00:52:48,734
Really?
What have you found?

894
00:52:48,735 --> 00:52:50,534
I really have it here.

895
00:52:53,766 --> 00:52:57,992
[What could that be?
It can't be...]

896
00:52:58,338 --> 00:53:02,100
Let's trade.

897
00:53:03,564 --> 00:53:05,662
- You have to find these, too.
- That's true.

898
00:53:05,663 --> 00:53:08,432
- This is very important.
- Okay.

899
00:53:08,433 --> 00:53:11,758
[Woo Bin already took out
what he needs from the bag.]

900
00:53:11,759 --> 00:53:13,988
Push it towards each other
on the count of three.

901
00:53:14,564 --> 00:53:16,783
One, two, three.

902
00:53:16,784 --> 00:53:21,433
[Trades the bag of pens for
the parchment.]

903
00:53:25,528 --> 00:53:28,030
[Ugh, why are there so many?]

904
00:53:29,559 --> 00:53:32,072
[Woo Bin gets the parchment in his hands.]

905
00:53:35,396 --> 00:53:38,370
[A hint alluding to his presence.]

906
00:53:42,564 --> 00:53:44,374
I'm going to have to hurry.

907
00:53:44,944 --> 00:53:46,942
Where could it be?

908
00:53:46,943 --> 00:53:49,368
[Rushing to find more blank name tags.]

909
00:53:58,421 --> 00:54:00,534
[That is...]

910
00:54:02,172 --> 00:54:06,181
[The first was outlined in red,
but this one is outlined in light purple.]

911
00:54:06,182 --> 00:54:09,547
[There must be a reason why
they're colored differently.]

912
00:54:11,010 --> 00:54:14,538
[Steps outside to solve the riddle of
the different colored name tags.]

913
00:54:15,376 --> 00:54:20,004
- Why did you take out some of the pens?
- I only took out a few.

914
00:54:20,005 --> 00:54:22,224
Let me see.
I'm just going to take a look at it.

915
00:54:22,225 --> 00:54:25,309
- Wait.
- Wow... is that it?

916
00:54:26,181 --> 00:54:27,701
Right?

917
00:54:27,702 --> 00:54:32,019
Don't you think that they're
related to our different characters?

918
00:54:32,763 --> 00:54:35,693
[Could it be?]

919
00:54:35,694 --> 00:54:38,633
I think these means something...
I'll share them with you.

920
00:54:38,634 --> 00:54:39,887
Okay.

921
00:54:39,888 --> 00:54:44,539
[Woo Bin offers up the pens in an
attempt to walk away from them.]

922
00:54:44,540 --> 00:54:47,537
We have to let each other know
if we find anything out, okay?

923
00:54:47,538 --> 00:54:50,036
[The members are still left
in a state of confusion.]

924
00:54:51,093 --> 00:54:53,747
[Just what is it that he discovered?]

925
00:54:53,748 --> 00:54:56,240
I got it.
I think I figured it out.

926
00:54:59,834 --> 00:55:02,650
It's the color of their buttons.

927
00:55:03,842 --> 00:55:06,792
[The color of their buttons?]

928
00:55:07,249 --> 00:55:08,997
[Just a moment ago...]

929
00:55:08,998 --> 00:55:12,079
[When he saw the members...]

930
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:14,461
[Ha Ha's buttons are yellow.]

931
00:55:16,366 --> 00:55:19,282
[Blank Ji's buttons are light purple.]

932
00:55:20,559 --> 00:55:24,289
[All the members'
button colors are different.]

933
00:55:24,290 --> 00:55:29,414
[The different colored outlines are
indicating to the different colored buttons.]

934
00:55:30,953 --> 00:55:34,148
[Woo Bin's keen eyes solve the mystery
of the blank name tags.]

935
00:55:36,014 --> 00:55:39,053
Running Man seriously is no joke.

936
00:55:41,211 --> 00:55:42,327
Have you found anything?

937
00:55:42,328 --> 00:55:44,674
Would I be walking around
aimlessly like this if I had?

938
00:55:44,675 --> 00:55:46,452
Woo Bin, have you found anything?

939
00:55:46,453 --> 00:55:52,150
[Jae Suk's buttons... are green!]

940
00:55:53,092 --> 00:55:55,416
I did find one parchment paper.

941
00:55:56,008 --> 00:56:00,350
- Okay, wait here.
- Come here. What do you have?

942
00:56:00,351 --> 00:56:02,414
[Jong Kook is...]

943
00:56:02,415 --> 00:56:05,058
[Wait, that's...]

944
00:56:05,059 --> 00:56:10,268
[The first name tag I found...
The red buttons!]

945
00:56:10,269 --> 00:56:13,414
[The owner of the name tag
has been found!]

946
00:56:14,263 --> 00:56:16,460
[While Kwang Soo diverts
their attention...]

947
00:56:16,461 --> 00:56:20,424
[Woo Bin disappears out of
their eyesight.]

948
00:56:23,984 --> 00:56:28,684
[Writes down red button wearing
Jong Kook's name onto the red name tag.]

949
00:56:30,893 --> 00:56:33,531
[Will it work?]

950
00:56:35,055 --> 00:56:37,094
This means someone's been ousted.

951
00:56:37,095 --> 00:56:38,539
Someone's been ousted.

952
00:56:38,911 --> 00:56:43,289
- Kim Jong Kook, out.
- What? Already?

953
00:56:43,290 --> 00:56:48,145
<i>Kim Jong Kook, out.
Kim Jong Kook, out.</i>

954
00:56:49,196 --> 00:56:51,452
- What did it say?
- I knew this was going to happen.

955
00:56:51,847 --> 00:56:54,243
I told you.
I knew this was going to happen.

956
00:56:54,244 --> 00:56:55,773
[Mr. Capable is the first one
to get ousted!]

957
00:56:59,095 --> 00:57:01,113
Wait, I shouldn't be cheering.

958
00:57:01,607 --> 00:57:04,681
- What? Kim Jong Kook is ousted?
- I told you!

959
00:57:04,682 --> 00:57:08,087
- Why? Who ousted you?
- What happened?

960
00:57:08,088 --> 00:57:09,678
[Jong Kook is ousted before
their own disbelieving eyes.]

961
00:57:09,679 --> 00:57:12,807
This is great!

962
00:57:12,808 --> 00:57:16,018
[Unsure of what just happened,
but still breaks out in a dance.]

963
00:57:16,019 --> 00:57:18,959
[It's time to celebrate!
Jong Kook's just been ousted.]

964
00:57:29,266 --> 00:57:35,320
[The location of the ancient script-
First piece of the puzzle.]

965
00:57:35,321 --> 00:57:39,961
[Byul]

966
00:57:39,962 --> 00:57:42,189
- Kim Jong Kook, out.
- See?

967
00:57:42,190 --> 00:57:44,357
He got ousted from being with
Kwang Soo.

968
00:57:44,358 --> 00:57:45,967
[Ha Ha suspects Kwang Soo.]

969
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:48,454
But look what I just found.

970
00:57:48,455 --> 00:57:50,737
[Ha Ha finds a piece of the
parchment paper.]

971
00:57:51,225 --> 00:57:56,936
[Oust the spy to find out the location.
The way to do that is...]

972
00:57:57,249 --> 00:58:00,086
[There's a spy?]

973
00:58:01,953 --> 00:58:03,949
What's the method to do that?

974
00:58:03,950 --> 00:58:05,360
[I can win the race if I oust the spy.]

975
00:58:05,361 --> 00:58:09,077
- Can I trust you? Keep this a secret.
- Of course, I will.

976
00:58:11,079 --> 00:58:12,555
Take it off, Suk Jin.

977
00:58:14,704 --> 00:58:17,488
- I knew it.
- You really haven't found anything?

978
00:58:17,489 --> 00:58:21,326
- There's a spy amongst us.
- Seriously?

979
00:58:21,883 --> 00:58:24,270
I'm just going to show
this to you.

980
00:58:24,271 --> 00:58:26,443
[Sharing what he discovered
with Jae Suk.]

981
00:58:26,444 --> 00:58:29,497
Oust the spy to find out the location.
The way to do that is...

982
00:58:29,498 --> 00:58:31,039
- How do you do it?
- That was it.

983
00:58:32,063 --> 00:58:34,719
We have to find a way to
oust the spy.

984
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:36,455
- You're not a spy, are you?
- No, I'm not.

985
00:58:36,456 --> 00:58:39,031
- I trusted you when I showed this to you.
- Of course.

986
00:58:39,582 --> 00:58:41,885
I didn't show this to you just so
that you could call others to alert them.

987
00:58:41,886 --> 00:58:43,779
There's no one around us, is there?

988
00:58:43,780 --> 00:58:45,493
There's no one around us, is there?

989
00:58:46,142 --> 00:58:47,439
Why are you acting like this?

990
00:58:49,907 --> 00:58:51,797
I'm sorry, Suk Jin.

991
00:58:53,171 --> 00:58:56,667
[Yoo Hyuk attempts to play a prank
and pretends to be the spy.]

992
00:59:00,734 --> 00:59:02,988
You think I'd actually fall for that?

993
00:59:03,390 --> 00:59:05,554
I'm not stupid.

994
00:59:05,555 --> 00:59:08,129
[Even though he may talk tough,
he continues to stop Jae Suk from writing.]

995
00:59:09,098 --> 00:59:11,944
[Suk Jin pulls out a pen of his own.]

996
00:59:13,395 --> 00:59:15,427
- Ji Suk Jin, out.
- Yoo Jae Suk, out.

997
00:59:15,980 --> 00:59:19,183
[Immature behavior of a 46 year old.]

998
00:59:19,633 --> 00:59:23,491
- The star can't be eliminated that easily.
- What? I'm the star here.

999
00:59:23,492 --> 00:59:25,463
You think that a star can be
so easily eliminated?

1000
00:59:25,464 --> 00:59:29,109
I even found the parchment paper.
Stop being so ridiculous.

1001
00:59:29,638 --> 00:59:31,796
[Meanwhile, Kwang Soo is...]

1002
00:59:33,731 --> 00:59:37,148
[Writes down Ji Hyo's name on the
purple name tag he got from Woo Bin.]

1003
00:59:37,149 --> 00:59:42,139
[He's writing down Ji Hyo's name!]

1004
00:59:44,336 --> 00:59:45,998
You don't think it's me, do you?

1005
00:59:45,999 --> 00:59:51,436
<i>Song Ji Hyo, out.</i>

1006
00:59:52,163 --> 00:59:53,942
<i>Song Ji Hyo, out.</i>

1007
00:59:54,553 --> 00:59:57,170
- What is this?
- What's going on here?

1008
00:59:57,171 --> 00:59:59,218
Where's Jae Suk?

1009
00:59:59,219 --> 01:00:01,108
Why did Song Ji Hyo get ousted?

1010
01:00:01,588 --> 01:00:03,720
What's written on
the parchment that you have?

1011
01:00:04,252 --> 01:00:06,380
[Ignores his question.]

1012
01:00:06,381 --> 01:00:11,467
Come on, Woo Bin.
Fine, I'll find one on my own.

1013
01:00:11,468 --> 01:00:13,402
Hey, I'll just find one on my own.

1014
01:00:13,403 --> 01:00:16,748
[How sad for anyone who hasn't
found a parchment paper of their own.]

1015
01:00:16,749 --> 01:00:19,420
- Ugh, seriously.
- I'll give this to you.

1016
01:00:19,421 --> 01:00:22,424
And don't forget what I told you.

1017
01:00:22,916 --> 01:00:26,038
- What? About the spy?
- Yeah. If I leave like this...

1018
01:00:27,005 --> 01:00:29,709
Don't just walk around aimlessly
and find something!

1019
01:00:30,925 --> 01:00:33,479
- Ugh, seriously.
- I'll go look for a gift for you.

1020
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:37,302
- Don't get yourself ousted, okay?
- Why would I get myself ousted?

1021
01:00:38,057 --> 01:00:39,749
['Byul' 'Yi'...]

1022
01:00:41,182 --> 01:00:46,576
[Earns the second piece of the puzzle
to where the script is kept.]

1023
01:00:47,394 --> 01:00:51,988
How am I going to eliminate them?
Everyone knows that there's a spy.

1024
01:00:52,688 --> 01:00:56,575
[They must now find out
how to eliminate the spy.]

1025
01:00:57,584 --> 01:00:59,044
Hey!

1026
01:00:59,617 --> 01:01:05,009
[Jae Suk actually finds something.]

1027
01:01:06,356 --> 01:01:09,180
<i>[Find the designated name tags
and write down their names.]</i>

1028
01:01:10,084 --> 01:01:11,662
What does this mean?

1029
01:01:14,350 --> 01:01:17,280
It must mean that there are
some name tags.

1030
01:01:17,281 --> 01:01:19,623
But where are these name tags?

1031
01:01:22,176 --> 01:01:24,577
It's one and the same.

1032
01:01:24,578 --> 01:01:27,106
The culprits are searching
for the name tags, too.

1033
01:01:29,100 --> 01:01:31,720
The culprits are writing down
the names on the name tags.

1034
01:01:33,204 --> 01:01:37,799
Jong Kook and Ji Hyo got ousted when they
wrote down their names on those name tags.

1035
01:01:42,774 --> 01:01:45,344
[Ha Ha discovers a name tag!]

1036
01:01:46,376 --> 01:01:50,208
[The blue name tag...
belongs to blue button wearing Gary.]

1037
01:01:50,209 --> 01:01:54,050
[But Ha Ha is still unaware of the secret
behind the blank name tags.]

1038
01:01:58,085 --> 01:02:01,676
[It must be one of these pens...]

1039
01:02:01,677 --> 01:02:03,180
I have to find it.

1040
01:02:03,181 --> 01:02:05,708
I need to find out how to do it.

1041
01:02:05,709 --> 01:02:08,038
[Must find out the method of elimination.]

1042
01:02:10,588 --> 01:02:12,438
Suk Jin is the spy.

1043
01:02:15,019 --> 01:02:19,044
- Woo Bin, I need to talk to you.
- Let's talk in private.

1044
01:02:19,902 --> 01:02:23,172
- Who do you think is the spy?
- Who do I think?

1045
01:02:24,516 --> 01:02:26,368
I have no idea.

1046
01:02:26,884 --> 01:02:31,068
- I found one.
- What?

1047
01:02:31,069 --> 01:02:33,343
- I found one of the name tags.
- Seriously?

1048
01:02:33,344 --> 01:02:34,726
Let me see.

1049
01:02:35,618 --> 01:02:39,079
- You haven't found any?
- I don't even know what it looks like.

1050
01:02:39,811 --> 01:02:42,064
[Bragging about his name tag to the spy.]

1051
01:02:42,855 --> 01:02:46,820
[This sky blue name tag is his own!]

1052
01:02:50,131 --> 01:02:52,389
[What do I do?]

1053
01:02:52,390 --> 01:02:54,177
Wait.

1054
01:02:55,828 --> 01:02:58,149
Wait here.
Stay there.

1055
01:02:59,018 --> 01:03:00,463
[Sunny and cheery as ever.]

1056
01:03:02,151 --> 01:03:07,605
[Pretends to be on the lookout,
and quietly calls Kwang Soo over.]

1057
01:03:08,952 --> 01:03:14,551
Kwang Soo and I have been talking
about it, and I don't think this is it.

1058
01:03:14,552 --> 01:03:16,791
What else could it be?
Try writing down my name.

1059
01:03:18,770 --> 01:03:22,496
[Writes down Hyun Woo's name
as he sits right next to them.]

1060
01:03:23,361 --> 01:03:25,861
[Sorry, Hyun Woo.]

1061
01:03:27,867 --> 01:03:32,625
<i>Lee Hyun Woo, out.</i>

1062
01:03:33,039 --> 01:03:34,360
See?

1063
01:03:34,361 --> 01:03:36,355
[Jae Suk witnesses the scene.]

1064
01:03:36,971 --> 01:03:40,032
- Lee Hyun Woo was the spy.
- What just happened?

1065
01:03:42,747 --> 01:03:44,866
Kim Woo Bin!

1066
01:03:46,825 --> 01:03:48,891
Kim Woo Bin!

1067
01:03:48,892 --> 01:03:50,240
[Even his cries of despair sound cheery.]

1068
01:03:51,260 --> 01:03:54,625
- He wrote down his own name.
- Who just wrote that down?

1069
01:03:54,626 --> 01:03:56,707
He wrote down his own name.

1070
01:03:56,708 --> 01:03:58,726
[Turns it around and says that
Hyun Woo wrote down his own name.]

1071
01:04:03,854 --> 01:04:07,223
This doesn't look like Hyun Woo wrote it.

1072
01:04:08,931 --> 01:04:10,954
Look at the handwriting.

1073
01:04:10,955 --> 01:04:12,949
The handwriting is different.

1074
01:04:13,076 --> 01:04:16,270
[Awkward expression on his face.]

1075
01:04:16,271 --> 01:04:19,864
[And immediately changes their story.]

1076
01:04:20,415 --> 01:04:22,346
I have no idea what's going on here.

1077
01:04:24,029 --> 01:04:26,034
Why did Hyun Woo get ousted?

1078
01:04:27,762 --> 01:04:30,984
Why did they leave that happy Hyun Woo
to write down his own name?

1079
01:04:31,626 --> 01:04:32,792
Woo Bin.

1080
01:04:33,145 --> 01:04:35,199
We need to find the green tag.

1081
01:04:35,486 --> 01:04:37,612
We have to find the green one
right now.

1082
01:04:37,613 --> 01:04:40,975
[This won't do. We need to
eliminate Jae Suk immediately.]

1083
01:04:42,906 --> 01:04:46,699
The colored outlines on the name tags...

1084
01:04:46,700 --> 01:04:49,601
I just figured it out.
It's the buttons.

1085
01:04:49,602 --> 01:04:51,431
It's the buttons.

1086
01:04:51,432 --> 01:04:55,601
[Ha Ha solves the mystery
of the buttons.]

1087
01:04:55,602 --> 01:04:57,779
Someone's buttons are red.

1088
01:04:57,780 --> 01:04:59,933
Kwang Soo's buttons are white.

1089
01:04:59,934 --> 01:05:04,770
They're all different.
I forgot what color Jong Kook's was.

1090
01:05:05,273 --> 01:05:08,390
We all have different colored buttons.

1091
01:05:11,142 --> 01:05:16,889
The name tag with the yellow outline...
is mine.

1092
01:05:16,890 --> 01:05:18,327
[Ha Ha accurately solves the
button mystery.]

1093
01:05:21,452 --> 01:05:24,464
Writing down my name on the yellow
name tag would mean that I get ousted.

1094
01:05:26,061 --> 01:05:34,647
I have to find the other colored tags,
and write down the matching name on it.

1095
01:05:34,648 --> 01:05:36,337
Okay, I've figured it out.

1096
01:05:36,338 --> 01:05:39,737
[The problem now is to find
the correct pen to use!]

1097
01:05:39,738 --> 01:05:45,155
[The net is starting to close in
on the spies!]

1098
01:05:46,495 --> 01:05:47,735
What is it?

1099
01:05:47,736 --> 01:05:49,804
[Just then...]

1100
01:05:49,805 --> 01:05:54,219
<i>Ji Suk Jin, out.</i>

1101
01:05:55,119 --> 01:05:58,221
[Spies' fourth victim, Big-nose.]

1102
01:06:01,907 --> 01:06:05,420
['Byul' 'Yi' 'Seo' 'Do'.]

1103
01:06:08,330 --> 01:06:11,331
- Good job.
- Did it work?

1104
01:06:11,366 --> 01:06:13,600
[Kwang Soo finds and eliminates Suk Jin
without anyone even knowing about it.]

1105
01:06:13,601 --> 01:06:16,078
We need to find out how much
the others know.

1106
01:06:16,079 --> 01:06:17,963
[Worried about what the
others may know.]

1107
01:06:17,964 --> 01:06:20,194
- Do you have any more name tags?
- No, I don't.

1108
01:06:20,838 --> 01:06:24,744
Are there name tags for us, too?

1109
01:06:24,745 --> 01:06:26,830
No, there can't be.

1110
01:06:29,972 --> 01:06:35,660
[Of course... there is.]

1111
01:06:36,516 --> 01:06:39,892
- Do you have mine?
- No, we're on the same team.

1112
01:06:39,893 --> 01:06:41,456
[Suspicions are back in place.]

1113
01:06:41,457 --> 01:06:45,050
I can't eliminate you
when you're my partner.

1114
01:06:48,914 --> 01:06:51,760
And I don't think the same rules
apply to us.

1115
01:06:56,922 --> 01:06:58,968
Ugh, what could it be?

1116
01:07:02,232 --> 01:07:05,130
[Ha Ha is the closest to figuring out
who the spies are at the moment.]

1117
01:07:07,604 --> 01:07:10,248
[Discovers another parchment paper!]

1118
01:07:10,249 --> 01:07:13,840
[Kiddo is taking care of
some business today.]

1119
01:07:16,289 --> 01:07:19,779
[Clue to the spy identity-
Baduk.]

1120
01:07:20,225 --> 01:07:23,502
[This hint indicates to
the identity of the spies!]

1121
01:07:23,503 --> 01:07:26,088
[Baduk?]

1122
01:07:29,855 --> 01:07:34,465
[The black and white pieces of baduk are
indicating to the spies' button colors.]

1123
01:07:35,616 --> 01:07:38,072
Someone already took them
out of here.

1124
01:07:39,259 --> 01:07:41,200
How am I going to
get that pen away from them?

1125
01:07:42,063 --> 01:07:44,512
The pen that Kwang Soo has
is the real one.

1126
01:07:46,363 --> 01:07:49,557
I have to find the name tags.
Ugh, this is so scary!

1127
01:07:49,558 --> 01:07:51,946
I'm suddenly getting scared
of Woo Bin.

1128
01:07:52,378 --> 01:07:56,149
[Find their own name tag and hide it,
or find the spies' name tag and oust them!]

1129
01:07:56,150 --> 01:07:58,034
Kwang Soo, you're really scary.

1130
01:07:58,035 --> 01:08:01,790
[Ha Ha makes contact with Kwang Soo
in order to get the pen in his hands.]

1131
01:08:03,189 --> 01:08:04,447
What else do you have?

1132
01:08:05,086 --> 01:08:08,203
[Searching through all of Kwang Soo's pens.]

1133
01:08:08,204 --> 01:08:10,520
[That's the real brush pen!]

1134
01:08:13,324 --> 01:08:17,032
I'm just going to borrow these, and be back.
I'll be right back with these.

1135
01:08:17,033 --> 01:08:20,346
- What is it?
- Dong Hoon.

1136
01:08:21,329 --> 01:08:24,106
- I'll seriously give them right back to you.
- Just give me one.

1137
01:08:24,107 --> 01:08:26,123
- Which one?
- I'll pick.

1138
01:08:26,124 --> 01:08:27,649
Okay.

1139
01:08:27,650 --> 01:08:30,690
- Give me one more.
- Why? Why are you being like this?

1140
01:08:30,691 --> 01:08:32,493
[Can't ask for the brush pen,
as that will just ignite his suspicion.]

1141
01:08:34,373 --> 01:08:36,024
Okay, here.

1142
01:08:36,701 --> 01:08:38,683
- Satisfied?
- Give me one more.

1143
01:08:38,684 --> 01:08:40,559
[Ha Ha still has the brush pen
in his hands.]

1144
01:08:41,179 --> 01:08:42,642
- Okay, we're good.
- Ha Ha.

1145
01:08:44,562 --> 01:08:47,747
[Gary picks up the abandoned case.]

1146
01:08:47,748 --> 01:08:49,411
Come on, Ha Ha.

1147
01:08:50,054 --> 01:08:52,658
[Ha Ha picks up on the clues,
and runs away from Kwang Soo.]

1148
01:08:53,418 --> 01:08:55,055
I think it's this one.

1149
01:08:55,642 --> 01:08:58,554
[Finds out which pen is the right one
from Kwang Soo's reaction.]

1150
01:09:03,022 --> 01:09:05,840
[Jae Suk joins the chase
while remaining clueless.]

1151
01:09:05,841 --> 01:09:07,869
Dong Hoon is the culprit!

1152
01:09:07,870 --> 01:09:10,155
- What did you say? Seriously?
- Dong Hoon is the culprit!

1153
01:09:10,156 --> 01:09:12,398
[Kwang Soo attempts to frame
Ha Ha of being the spy.]

1154
01:09:12,399 --> 01:09:14,523
- No, it's Kwang Soo.
- Jae Suk, we have to catch Ha Ha.

1155
01:09:14,524 --> 01:09:16,107
[Jae Suk doesn't know who to believe.]

1156
01:09:16,108 --> 01:09:19,128
- Kwang Soo is trying to frame me.
- Wow, you're such a liar.

1157
01:09:19,129 --> 01:09:22,618
[Ha Ha gets the brush pen
in his hands...]

1158
01:09:22,619 --> 01:09:25,201
[Just then, the announcement
bell sounds.]

1159
01:09:27,031 --> 01:09:31,824
<i>Yoo Jae Suk, out.</i>

1160
01:09:32,615 --> 01:09:34,568
<i>Yoo Jae Suk, out.</i>

1161
01:09:36,011 --> 01:09:40,807
[Woo Bin find the green name tag and
ousts Jae Suk in the midst of the confusion.]

1162
01:09:40,808 --> 01:09:43,617
Yoo Jae Suk.

1163
01:09:46,133 --> 01:09:49,132
[Earns the fifth piece of the puzzle.]

1164
01:09:52,011 --> 01:09:56,132
['Byul' 'Yi' 'Seo' 'So' 'Gwan'.]

1165
01:09:58,295 --> 01:10:00,197
Byul Gwan?

1166
01:10:00,514 --> 01:10:04,336
[One step closer to the location.]

1167
01:10:06,138 --> 01:10:09,798
[Now, it's Kwang Soo and Woo Bin
vs Ha Ha and Gary.]

1168
01:10:09,799 --> 01:10:12,848
Dong Hoon took my pen.
It's over if he ousts us first.

1169
01:10:12,849 --> 01:10:15,828
[The Spy Brothers are in danger of
being ousted by Ha Ha.]

1170
01:10:15,829 --> 01:10:21,904
I found another piece of the puzzle,
but we have to oust the other two first.

1171
01:10:29,088 --> 01:10:32,296
The spy can't rip off your
name tag, can he?

1172
01:10:32,297 --> 01:10:35,606
It's not about ripping off the name tag,
but it's about writing down the name.

1173
01:10:35,607 --> 01:10:38,641
- Then can't you write down the name now?
- I don't have any name tags.

1174
01:10:38,642 --> 01:10:41,538
- You don't have the name tag?
- We have to find his white name tag.

1175
01:10:41,539 --> 01:10:46,204
[Must find either the white or the black
name tag and oust the spies!]

1176
01:10:49,168 --> 01:10:51,848
If he finds our name tags first,
then it's all over for us.

1177
01:10:53,042 --> 01:10:54,992
- Hey, Dong Hoon.
- Yeah?

1178
01:10:56,746 --> 01:10:59,068
- What about this color?
- What is it?

1179
01:10:59,734 --> 01:11:01,816
Do you need this one?

1180
01:11:02,328 --> 01:11:06,338
[Wait, that's Ha Ha's yellow
name tag!]

1181
01:11:06,339 --> 01:11:08,804
Gary, this would be big trouble.

1182
01:11:08,805 --> 01:11:11,830
That name tag would eliminate you, right?

1183
01:11:13,119 --> 01:11:15,108
- Did I do a good job?
- Totally.

1184
01:11:15,109 --> 01:11:17,277
- Let me give you a kiss.
- No, don't do it.

1185
01:11:17,278 --> 01:11:20,039
- We'll split the prize if we win.
- Really?

1186
01:11:22,718 --> 01:11:25,083
[Who knew that Gary would have
Ha Ha's name tag!]

1187
01:11:25,084 --> 01:11:27,230
I was going to keep it to myself.

1188
01:11:28,679 --> 01:11:30,997
- I'm going to give you this as a gift.
- What is it?

1189
01:11:32,323 --> 01:11:33,359
[Huh?]

1190
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:35,320
I almost killed you myself.

1191
01:11:36,006 --> 01:11:38,889
[Ha Ha pulls out Gary's
name tag out of his pants!]

1192
01:11:39,218 --> 01:11:41,748
No, not there.
Put it down your pants.

1193
01:11:41,749 --> 01:11:44,274
- What if your hat falls off?
- No, it's okay.

1194
01:11:45,629 --> 01:11:49,356
[They each had each other's lives
in the grasp of their hands.]

1195
01:11:49,985 --> 01:11:54,684
One of those two could have
their own name tags on them.

1196
01:11:54,685 --> 01:11:56,621
I have no doubt.

1197
01:11:56,622 --> 01:11:59,281
[Can't find any more name tags and
guesses that they must have it on them.]

1198
01:12:02,282 --> 01:12:06,773
[The Spy Brothers prepares to
faceoff with Gary and Ha Ha.]

1199
01:12:07,194 --> 01:12:08,774
Have you found anything?

1200
01:12:08,775 --> 01:12:11,118
[Walks towards them...]

1201
01:12:12,612 --> 01:12:14,156
Why are you following us?

1202
01:12:15,469 --> 01:12:19,079
[Attempts to surround them.]

1203
01:12:19,080 --> 01:12:21,828
- What are you looking for?
- We don't have anything.

1204
01:12:21,829 --> 01:12:24,552
[Gary and Ha Ha are in possession
of their own name tags.]

1205
01:12:26,546 --> 01:12:29,438
[Ha Ha senses the danger and
attempts to flee.]

1206
01:12:29,439 --> 01:12:31,440
What are you looking for?
I don't have anything.

1207
01:12:31,441 --> 01:12:33,460
[Gary puts on a dumb act.]

1208
01:12:33,461 --> 01:12:36,217
Come here, Dong Hoon!
What are they looking for?

1209
01:12:36,218 --> 01:12:38,400
[The spies aren't backing off.]

1210
01:12:40,753 --> 01:12:42,452
I'm going to have to hide it.

1211
01:12:42,453 --> 01:12:44,947
[Ha Ha successfully escapes with
his pen and name tag still intact.]

1212
01:12:45,735 --> 01:12:47,478
I really don't have anything, Kwang Soo.

1213
01:12:47,479 --> 01:12:50,144
[Gary is receiving a full body search.]

1214
01:12:50,145 --> 01:12:51,909
I told you that I don't have anything!

1215
01:12:55,384 --> 01:12:57,155
Kwang Soo, here it is.

1216
01:12:59,972 --> 01:13:02,703
Why are you doing this to me!

1217
01:13:02,704 --> 01:13:05,324
[The hat boy fails to protect
the name tag lamb.]

1218
01:13:09,426 --> 01:13:13,463
I didn't even get to do anything!

1219
01:13:15,335 --> 01:13:16,929
No, what are you doing!

1220
01:13:16,930 --> 01:13:17,796
[Kwang Soo stops in the midst of writing.]

1221
01:13:20,010 --> 01:13:21,231
What are you doing!

1222
01:13:21,721 --> 01:13:23,322
No, don't do this!

1223
01:13:23,323 --> 01:13:26,759
[Forcing him to finish writing out
his own name. How cruel...]

1224
01:13:33,983 --> 01:13:35,399
We got it!

1225
01:13:36,555 --> 01:13:41,371
<i>Gary, out.</i>

1226
01:13:42,913 --> 01:13:46,230
[Discovers the sixth piece
of the puzzle.]

1227
01:13:46,231 --> 01:13:48,484
Dong Hoon almost has you two,
so you'd better watch out.

1228
01:13:49,139 --> 01:13:50,870
[Seriously?]

1229
01:13:50,871 --> 01:13:52,908
- It's all over for you two.
- Does he know our button colors?

1230
01:13:52,909 --> 01:13:54,788
What?
He knows about the button colors?

1231
01:13:55,288 --> 01:13:59,890
[Left remaining-
Two spies vs Ha Ha.]

1232
01:13:59,891 --> 01:14:03,039
[Eliminate the last remaining person
to find out the location!]

1233
01:14:03,040 --> 01:14:05,414
I'm sure that he has his own name tag.

1234
01:14:05,960 --> 01:14:09,418
Gary just said that
he traded his own name tag.

1235
01:14:11,606 --> 01:14:15,760
[Kwang Soo and Woo Bin are in
full search mode for Ha Ha.]

1236
01:14:18,656 --> 01:14:20,460
I don't think I can find it.

1237
01:14:21,198 --> 01:14:22,642
Have you found it?

1238
01:14:22,643 --> 01:14:25,048
[Kwang Soo discovers Ha Ha.]

1239
01:14:25,049 --> 01:14:27,482
If you've found it, then I'm sure you
would've already written it down.

1240
01:14:27,483 --> 01:14:30,013
[Mind game to feel each other out.]

1241
01:14:31,376 --> 01:14:34,666
[It all comes down to who'll be first
to get the name tag in their hands.]

1242
01:14:37,453 --> 01:14:40,700
[Each thinks that they have their own
name tags and starts to search.]

1243
01:14:42,856 --> 01:14:44,481
Ha Ha, did you hide it somewhere?

1244
01:14:44,482 --> 01:14:49,038
- Lee Kwang Soo, out.
- What the heck!

1245
01:14:49,039 --> 01:14:52,278
[What?]

1246
01:14:53,140 --> 01:14:55,461
Ha Ha, did you write down my
name somewhere?

1247
01:14:55,462 --> 01:14:58,842
[How can Kwang Soo be ousted
when Ha Ha's standing right here?]

1248
01:14:58,843 --> 01:15:01,376
[That can only mean...]

1249
01:15:02,424 --> 01:15:06,724
[Woo Bin ousted Kwang Soo!]

1250
01:15:06,725 --> 01:15:08,756
[Completely unexpected!]

1251
01:15:09,790 --> 01:15:16,105
[Why would he eliminate his
own spy partner?]

1252
01:15:16,795 --> 01:15:24,008
[A while ago... Woo Bin discovers
Kwang Soo's white name tag.]

1253
01:15:26,768 --> 01:15:28,575
This is Kwang Soo's name tag.

1254
01:15:30,382 --> 01:15:34,412
[Just in case, he keeps it
a secret from Kwang Soo.]

1255
01:15:35,328 --> 01:15:38,834
[After ousting Gary, six of the
seven puzzle pieces are found.]

1256
01:15:38,835 --> 01:15:42,850
[Only one more puzzle piece is needed!
Must eliminate just one more person.]

1257
01:15:42,851 --> 01:15:50,234
[Just then...
he remembers the other name tag.]

1258
01:15:55,808 --> 01:15:58,134
This was all learned from you.

1259
01:15:58,135 --> 01:15:59,850
I'm sorry.

1260
01:15:59,851 --> 01:16:02,102
I had no other choice.

1261
01:16:03,979 --> 01:16:06,697
I'm sorry, Kwang Soo.

1262
01:16:09,503 --> 01:16:12,488
[Thus, Kwang Soo is ousted.]

1263
01:16:12,489 --> 01:16:15,342
[What just happened!]

1264
01:16:15,924 --> 01:16:17,647
What is this all about?

1265
01:16:17,648 --> 01:16:21,276
- Did you just oust me?
- No, I didn't. What color is Woo Bin?

1266
01:16:21,277 --> 01:16:23,398
[Goodbye, Kwang Soo.]

1267
01:16:23,399 --> 01:16:25,105
Woo Bin, I've been eliminated!

1268
01:16:25,106 --> 01:16:27,328
I think Dong Hoon knows
everything!

1269
01:16:27,329 --> 01:16:31,295
[The Giraffe still doesn't
understand what's just happened.]

1270
01:16:34,184 --> 01:16:37,650
[Finally earns the last piece
of the puzzle.]

1271
01:16:39,170 --> 01:16:41,274
The library annex on the second floor?

1272
01:16:41,275 --> 01:16:43,854
Second floor library annex?

1273
01:16:43,855 --> 01:16:47,098
['Byul' 'Yi' 'Seo' 'So'
'Gwan' 'Gwan' 'Cheung']

1274
01:16:47,099 --> 01:16:50,465
[Second floor library annex.]

1275
01:16:50,874 --> 01:16:53,818
[Second floor library annex-
Just need to get to the location to win!]

1276
01:16:53,819 --> 01:16:56,989
The spy is amongst you.

1277
01:16:59,026 --> 01:17:01,614
You're seriously no joke.

1278
01:17:01,615 --> 01:17:02,910
What do you mean?

1279
01:17:02,911 --> 01:17:07,147
Write down the names onto
the designated blank name tags.

1280
01:17:07,999 --> 01:17:10,140
- What is it?
- I have something for you.

1281
01:17:10,141 --> 01:17:12,125
Why are you giving me so many?

1282
01:17:12,888 --> 01:17:15,097
The spy...

1283
01:17:15,098 --> 01:17:17,056
is amongst you!

1284
01:17:19,023 --> 01:17:21,245
That's why you'll never make it.

1285
01:17:21,246 --> 01:17:25,246
I'm... the spy!

1286
01:17:29,955 --> 01:17:31,294
What is this?

1287
01:17:31,776 --> 01:17:33,131
Cheung?

1288
01:17:33,481 --> 01:17:35,963
Second floor library annex.

1289
01:17:35,964 --> 01:17:38,366
[Woo Bin is getting closer
to the ancient script.]

1290
01:17:39,355 --> 01:17:42,219
Kwang Soo, I'm sorry.

1291
01:17:42,220 --> 01:17:43,564
[The ancient script is mine!]

1292
01:17:44,839 --> 01:17:48,877
[Follows the clues and
makes it up to the library annex.]

1293
01:17:48,878 --> 01:17:51,708
[The legendary ancient script
is right in front of his eyes.]

1294
01:17:54,758 --> 01:17:59,088
[Only one name can be added
to the script.]

1295
01:18:00,291 --> 01:18:01,972
The ancient script.

1296
01:18:08,087 --> 01:18:13,549
[The owner of the script... Kim Woo Bin.]

1297
01:18:15,942 --> 01:18:18,565
<i>You didn't find anything out?</i>

1298
01:18:18,566 --> 01:18:22,009
[If they had all worked together,
then they could've easily figured it out.]

1299
01:18:22,010 --> 01:18:24,385
This was all because you kept
everything to yourself.

1300
01:18:24,386 --> 01:18:27,202
You knew that Woo Bin was behind it all?
Seriously, Woo Bin.

1301
01:18:27,203 --> 01:18:30,476
This is the one thing that I've learned
from being on Running Man four times.

1302
01:18:30,995 --> 01:18:33,669
[What he learned was knowing
how to betray.]

1303
01:18:34,718 --> 01:18:39,898
Hyun Woo never found anything out,
but kept that cheerful smile on his face.

1304
01:18:39,899 --> 01:18:43,082
Anyway, today's winner is,
Kim Woo Bin!

1305
01:18:43,083 --> 01:18:45,276

Final winner- Kim Woo Bin.]
