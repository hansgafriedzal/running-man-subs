[He has returned.
The return of the Korean Monster.]

3
00:00:11,163 --> 00:00:13,881
[And... another hero.]

4

[Double heroes.]

5
00:00:19,007 --> 00:00:23,949
[The last episode of 2014-
Running Man's red carpet entrance.]

6
00:00:24,725 --> 00:00:26,340
You look pretty only a few
times a year.

7
00:00:26,341 --> 00:00:29,269
[What a rude thing to say
at the end of the year.]

8
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:32,212
- It's snowing pretty hard outside.
- Yes, it is.

9
00:00:32,213 --> 00:00:37,399
Of all the things that have happened, can
you share what left the biggest impression?

10
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,084
What we remember the most?

11
00:00:39,085 --> 00:00:43,291
Ha Ha and I went on a tour
to the States last week.

12
00:00:45,055 --> 00:00:47,897
[Jong Kook and Ha Ha recently came back
from their tour of the States.]

13
00:00:47,898 --> 00:00:49,316
What about you, Kwang Soo?

14
00:00:49,317 --> 00:00:51,695
I'm sure it's the scandal he remembers.

15
00:00:52,931 --> 00:00:55,179
Wang Ji Hye, you're so dead!

16
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:56,761
Wang Ji Hye!

17
00:00:56,762 --> 00:00:59,442
[Kwang Soo's scandal that Ji Hye
has shone a light on for the world.]

18
00:00:59,443 --> 00:01:03,615
- What about you, Ji Hyo?
- What do you remember, Ji Hyo?

19
00:01:03,616 --> 00:01:05,126
Me?

20
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:09,525
What's seriously going on
between you and Gary?

21
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:14,593
He seriously asked me to date him for
a month for the sake of our show.

22
00:01:15,352 --> 00:01:17,821
- That doesn't sound so bad.
- That's how things get started.

23
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:22,365
Today's race is, the Foreigner Club Race.

24
00:01:22,366 --> 00:01:23,613
Foreigner Club Race?

25
00:01:23,614 --> 00:01:27,672
We will introduce you to our guests
who will be perfect as your leaders.

26
00:01:27,673 --> 00:01:28,986
[Running Man's Monster is on the scene.]

27
00:01:30,966 --> 00:01:37,605
<i>- The first Korean Major leaguer...
- He will be soon joining the major leagues.</i>

28
00:01:37,606 --> 00:01:39,240
Baseball club?

29
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:44,081
<i>Winning the best new player, and the MVP
title in the same year as the first in history.</i>

30
00:01:46,463 --> 00:01:51,179
[2006, 2007, 2009, 2010, 2012-
Strikeout King for all five years.]

31
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:53,464
- That's amazing, isn't it?
- That's beyond impressive.

32
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:00,524
[Number 99]

33
00:02:00,525 --> 00:02:04,474
[The Korean Monster that
took over the Major Leagues.]

34
00:02:09,217 --> 00:02:12,033
[The national Major Leaguer-
Ryu Hyun Jin.]

35
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,890
[Part of the Running Man family-
The return of Ryu Hyun Jin.]

36
00:02:15,891 --> 00:02:19,660
2014 Foreign Club Race Special
with our very own Ryu Hyun Jin.

37
00:02:20,243 --> 00:02:25,239
Starting right this moment...
nine hours will start to count down.

38
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,089
You have nine hours from now on.

39
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:30,791
Nine hours is what you will have
to complete the entire mission.

40
00:02:30,792 --> 00:02:32,862
I think we're going to wrap up
the filming within nine hours.

41
00:02:32,863 --> 00:02:35,241
- I doubt that.
- That would be awesome.

42
00:02:36,517 --> 00:02:38,945
- Let's go out to dinner after we're done.
- Let's go out to dinner!

43
00:02:38,946 --> 00:02:42,152
[Thanks to the short filming day,
making plans for end of the year outing?]

44
00:02:42,153 --> 00:02:44,537
- That would be great!
- That would be the best.

45
00:02:44,538 --> 00:02:46,805
[Seriously?]

46
00:02:46,806 --> 00:02:51,586
If you can complete your missions and
get to the final location within nine hours

47
00:02:51,587 --> 00:02:54,180
then a surprising gift
will be waiting for you there.

48
00:02:54,331 --> 00:02:57,036
- Ryu Hyun Jin isn't here yet, correct?
- No, where is he?

49
00:02:57,037 --> 00:03:03,712
Find Ryu Hyun Jin on time and
get him to say a fixed line for you guys.

50
00:03:03,713 --> 00:03:05,699
That will be your first mission.

51
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:08,784
The line you need to hear
from Ryun Hyun Jin is...

52
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,979
It's steamed buns!

53
00:03:11,532 --> 00:03:15,181
- You can check under the steamed buns.
- It must be inside there.

54
00:03:15,182 --> 00:03:17,830
She's really good at picking
things out.

55
00:03:17,831 --> 00:03:20,574
- I'm...
- Leave the pizza one for me.

56
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:22,190
I'm going to take the pizza bun.

57
00:03:22,191 --> 00:03:25,925
I'm sure something is stuck
to the bottom of the bun.

58
00:03:27,017 --> 00:03:30,705
- Is something written underneath?
- 'I'm handsome, and you're pretty.'

59
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:34,846
- That's tough.
- This one is really hard.

60
00:03:34,847 --> 00:03:38,191
This is what I need to hear
Ryu Hyun Jin say to me?

61
00:03:38,962 --> 00:03:40,030
[Kkuk's steamed bun.]

62
00:03:40,065 --> 00:03:42,741
- You have small eyes...
- And I'm chubby.

63
00:03:44,131 --> 00:03:47,135
[If that actually is the line, it'll
be an easy one to get him to say.]

64
00:03:47,412 --> 00:03:50,795
Get him to pinch my cheeks and ask,
'Do you like me?'

65
00:03:50,796 --> 00:03:55,322
- That's not that bad.
- I think it should be okay.

66
00:03:55,792 --> 00:03:57,320
- I think I can do this one.
- What is it?

67
00:03:57,321 --> 00:03:59,229
'I'm really, really cute, aren't I?'

68
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:02,430
- I don't know about that one.
- Does he have to say 'really, really?'

69
00:04:02,431 --> 00:04:05,784
- Yes, he has to say those words.
- He likes to say those things.

70
00:04:05,785 --> 00:04:08,264
- Okay, my turn. Oh! I'm good.
- What is it?

71
00:04:08,265 --> 00:04:10,518
'Jae Suk, don't touch me.'
See? I'm good.

72
00:04:10,519 --> 00:04:13,060
- Let me have that one.
- What the heck!

73
00:04:13,095 --> 00:04:15,225
[A very easy mission, indeed.]

74
00:04:15,226 --> 00:04:17,538
- 'Jae Suk, don't touch me.'
- That's the easiest one.

75
00:04:17,539 --> 00:04:20,657
- What is it?
- 'Yay, I have 14 wins!'

76
00:04:20,658 --> 00:04:26,678
- Does he have to say it just like that?
- Yes, it must be 'Yay, I have 14 wins!'

77
00:04:26,679 --> 00:04:28,198
- That's hard.
- This is hard.

78
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:30,455
How am I going to get him to say
'Ryu Hyun Jin is a monster pitcher.'

79
00:04:30,456 --> 00:04:34,091
- He has to say that?
- And he has to say his own name, too.

80
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:36,941
I think I can do this one.
'Are you pissed off at me?'

81
00:04:36,942 --> 00:04:38,604
- What?
- 'Are you pissed off at me?'

82
00:04:38,605 --> 00:04:41,330
'Are you pissed off at me?'
Kwang Soo and I have the easier ones.

83
00:04:41,331 --> 00:04:44,883
- I think Ryu Hyun Jin is...
- Who says 'Really, really' these days?

84
00:04:44,884 --> 00:04:47,706
[Let's just finish eating
these delicious steamed buns first.]

85
00:04:48,296 --> 00:04:50,048
You'll be given a time limit.

86
00:04:50,049 --> 00:04:52,576
- You'll be given 15 minutes.
- Okay.

87
00:04:52,577 --> 00:04:54,854
The clock will start ticking
the moment you walk out of here.

88
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:58,422
The person who finishes last
will receive a penalty.

89
00:04:58,423 --> 00:04:59,889
- Only the last person in?
- Yes, only the last person to finish.

90
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:03,090
The weather outside is about
negative seven degrees right now...

91
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:06,980
Only the person who finishes last will
have to be without a coat for the day.

92
00:05:06,981 --> 00:05:08,219
[No coat for the loser of the mission.]

93
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:10,282
[Kkuk may catch a cold...]

94
00:05:10,283 --> 00:05:13,175
- 15 minutes will start now.
- I understand.

95
00:05:13,176 --> 00:05:18,974
[Find Ryu Hyun Jin and complete
the mission within 15 minutes.]

96
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:24,061
[Ryu Hyun Jin is at a nearby building
that is marked with the 'R' flag.]

97
00:05:24,062 --> 00:05:25,263
Go!

98
00:05:25,264 --> 00:05:28,847
[Terrifying Foreign Nine Inning-
Hell Training- Start.]

99
00:05:29,733 --> 00:05:31,828
[Must hear the specific line
they're given from Ryu Hyun Jin.]

100
00:05:31,829 --> 00:05:34,275
- There it is!
- Where?

101
00:05:34,651 --> 00:05:38,140
['R' flag is discovered.]

102
00:05:40,678 --> 00:05:42,678
[Ryu Hyun Jin is inside this building!]

103
00:05:42,679 --> 00:05:45,089
We have to go up.
Can he be anywhere in this building?

104
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:47,987
- I don't know which floor he's on.
- Maybe he's eating.

105
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:50,912
There are over ten floors
in this building.

106
00:05:50,913 --> 00:05:54,075
- This isn't going to work.
- Want to work our way down from the top?

107
00:05:54,076 --> 00:05:56,268
- What's in there.
- Hello.

108
00:05:56,269 --> 00:05:59,927
Hello.
By any chance, is Hyun Jin in here?

109
00:06:01,365 --> 00:06:02,986
- Excuse me?
- He's up on the 13th floor.

110
00:06:02,987 --> 00:06:06,302
Thank you!
He's up on the 13th floor!

111
00:06:06,877 --> 00:06:09,239
Let's just go by ourselves.
Let's just go.

112
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:12,299
Jong Kook, he's just up the stairs.

113
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:15,394
You just yelled out that he's up
on the 13th floor.

114
00:06:15,395 --> 00:06:19,171
What are you doing?
Do you think I'm that stupid?

115
00:06:19,172 --> 00:06:22,109
[Jae Suk keeps climbing up the stairs.]

116
00:06:23,113 --> 00:06:26,493
- There's the sticker.
- Let's go!

[Hyun Jin is somewhere within this room...]

118

- Hello.
- There he is!

119

reunite after a year!]

but our mission comes first.]

124

- You've gotten even cuter!
- I brought you some steamed buns.

125
00:07:02,646 --> 00:07:05,489
- Wow, I can't believe he's here.
- How did you get even cuter?

126
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:10,659
You've gotten really, really cute!

128
00:07:14,641 --> 00:07:16,323

[Jae Suk finally arrives.]

130
00:07:18,189 --> 00:07:21,840
What are you talking about?
No, you have to listen!

131
00:07:21,841 --> 00:07:23,994
[Jae Suk, don't touch me!]

132
00:07:23,994 --> 00:07:26,116
Hey, when did you get so cute?

133
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:29,980
I like you!
I like you so much!

00:07:31,819 --> 00:07:33,765
Ugh, be quiet!

[Ha Ha's mission-
'Yay, I have 14 wins!']

143
00:07:56,981 --> 00:08:02,172
I just saw a newspaper article on you,
and the headline said, 'Monster.'

144
00:08:02,497 --> 00:08:05,342
- It was seriously...
- Stop that!

145
00:08:05,343 --> 00:08:08,675
- What are you doing?
- That's so disgusting!

- You're so handsome!

152

- Wait.
- No one's going to succeed like this.

153

- Get in line and take turns.
- Let's have one person at a time do it.

154

- Hyun Jin, I'm so disappointed in you.

- Why?
- How old are you?

00:08:53,546 --> 00:08:57,266
- I was just kidding!
- Forget the show, and just go home.

162
00:08:57,267 --> 00:08:59,350
- You're over.
- I was just kidding!

163
00:08:59,351 --> 00:09:03,529
Hyun Jin, I've been telling you that
you look great and you're looking slimmer.

164
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:07,319
You even did your hair today, too.
Hyun Jin, you look very...

165
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,899
- He's looks very, what?
- What are you talking about?

166
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:12,247
- What are you trying to say to Hyun Jin?
- He looks like what?

167
00:09:12,248 --> 00:09:16,221
- What are you trying to say?
- The thing that all men like to hear.

168
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:19,305
What, that I have a nice build?
That I'm built really, really big?

169
00:09:19,306 --> 00:09:21,400
That I have a really, really nice body?

170
00:09:21,401 --> 00:09:22,502
[Explaining everything to
help benefit their own mission.]

171
00:09:22,503 --> 00:09:24,937
Monster... a total monster!

172
00:09:24,938 --> 00:09:27,434
[Something's definitely going on here...]

173
00:09:27,435 --> 00:09:30,628
Yay, I have 13 wins on Running Man.
What about you?

174
00:09:32,675 --> 00:09:34,345
Yay, I did it!

175
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:41,375
[Finally gets what's going on!]

176
00:09:41,376 --> 00:09:45,453
- Yay, I have 15 wins.
- I have 14...

177
00:09:49,069 --> 00:09:50,971
[Yes, that's it!]

178
00:09:50,972 --> 00:09:53,994
I have 14 wins.

179
00:09:58,386 --> 00:10:01,068
Yay, I did it!
Yay, I did it!

180
00:10:01,069 --> 00:10:03,355
I know what Ha Ha's mission is.

181
00:10:04,837 --> 00:10:08,012
- Do you want me to not like you?
- No, you have to like me.

182
00:10:08,429 --> 00:10:10,801
Then I want you to ask me that.

183
00:10:11,505 --> 00:10:13,439
No, you can't touch him!

184
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,126
Don't touch him!

185
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:21,245
[Dirty Jae Suk is immediately reprimanded.]

186
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:25,824
- Is this what I have to do?
- I can't touch you like this, right?

187
00:10:25,825 --> 00:10:28,511
- I can't touch you, right?
- Don't touch me!

188
00:10:33,578 --> 00:10:35,657
[I get it now!]

189
00:10:36,164 --> 00:10:38,376
[Jae Suk is first to succeed his mission.]

190
00:10:39,541 --> 00:10:41,640
One person at a time.
I can't get it otherwise.

191
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:44,185
Yay, I got 13 wins on Running Man!

192
00:10:44,186 --> 00:10:47,620
I got 14 wins... but.

193
00:10:50,603 --> 00:10:53,275
[Got you, didn't I?]

194
00:10:54,012 --> 00:10:56,159
[Shocked by Hyun Jin.]

195
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:59,041
Kang Gary is really, really handsome!

196
00:10:59,042 --> 00:11:02,266
[The members are slowly
starting to feel anxious.]

197
00:11:02,267 --> 00:11:03,960
Ryu Hyun Jin, how can you
do this to me?

198
00:11:06,901 --> 00:11:10,643
[Kkuk's mission- 'Do you like me?'
while pinching both cheeks.]

199
00:11:10,895 --> 00:11:12,347
Do you like me?

200
00:11:12,962 --> 00:11:14,626
[Pinch my cheeks.]

201
00:11:17,359 --> 00:11:19,440
[What you said earlier...]

202
00:11:19,441 --> 00:11:21,969
Why don't you just tell him
what to do instead?

203
00:11:23,376 --> 00:11:24,858
Okay, I get it!

204
00:11:26,328 --> 00:11:28,049
- Just do it for me once.
- I didn't get my chance yet!

205
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:32,162
- Yay, you got 13 wins, right?
- What was that?

206
00:11:34,013 --> 00:11:36,558
- Yay, how many wins did you have?
- Me?

207
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:38,989
Yay, I had 14 wins.

208
00:11:39,732 --> 00:11:41,659
[Yay, I succeeded!]

209
00:11:43,933 --> 00:11:48,052
[I don't want to face the penalty!
The battle ensues.]

210
00:11:48,053 --> 00:11:52,344
- Why are you so cute!
- Kershaw is a monster pitcher.

211
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:56,811
- Wow... what would that make you?
- Ah... I'm a monster pitcher?

212
00:11:56,812 --> 00:12:00,280
So who would that make you?
You're better than him, aren't you?

213
00:12:00,281 --> 00:12:03,665
'Who would that make you?'
Just tell him your mission instead.

214
00:12:03,666 --> 00:12:05,922
- Just tell him what to say.
- Who are you?

215
00:12:05,923 --> 00:12:08,226
- Ryu Hyun Jin.
- That's right. What are you?

216
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:10,327
[That's right. What are you?]

217
00:12:10,328 --> 00:12:13,104
Ryu Hyun Jin is a monster pitcher.

218
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:17,982
[Big-nosed Brother is the third to succeed!]

219
00:12:17,983 --> 00:12:22,115
Hyun Jin, you are...
something that all men wants to hear.

220
00:12:23,046 --> 00:12:25,349
- That I'm cool?
- Yes, that's right.

221
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:27,172
What about me?

222
00:12:27,173 --> 00:12:29,389
- You've gotten cooler.
- You've gotten prettier.

223
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:33,190
- She's really asking for it today.
- And!

224
00:12:33,191 --> 00:12:35,031
- What?
- And?

225
00:12:35,032 --> 00:12:37,664
- What is she saying?
- Go!

226
00:12:37,665 --> 00:12:41,053
[Blank Ji, go to the back!]

227
00:12:41,054 --> 00:12:42,521
And you're pretty?

228
00:12:42,522 --> 00:12:45,379
- Do this while you talk to me.
- Do you like me?

229
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:47,093
Do you like me?

230
00:12:47,374 --> 00:12:49,616
He did it, right?
He did it.

231
00:12:50,035 --> 00:12:52,095
[Only three are left to go!]

232
00:12:55,019 --> 00:12:58,353
What happens when I don't
answer your calls?

233
00:12:58,354 --> 00:13:00,596
What are you going to say
if I tell you I'm disappointed in you?

234
00:13:00,597 --> 00:13:03,132
- I'm really, really cute.
- I'd be annoyed.

235
00:13:03,133 --> 00:13:04,450
Ryu Hyun Jin.

236
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:06,764
You're pissed off.

237
00:13:06,765 --> 00:13:08,475
- You're pissed off.
- Okay, good.

238
00:13:10,127 --> 00:13:12,618
- Today, I'm...
- Hey, Ryu Hyun Jin.

239
00:13:13,379 --> 00:13:15,998
- I'm really...
- Kwang Soo, are you pissed off at me?

240
00:13:18,446 --> 00:13:21,913
- Hyun Jin, you really are...
- You're so cute.

241
00:13:21,914 --> 00:13:24,507
- How are you cute?
- Hyun Jin!

242
00:13:24,508 --> 00:13:28,836
- I'm really, really...
- Gary keeps repeating that word.

243
00:13:29,777 --> 00:13:31,597
You two should just be a couple.

244
00:13:33,369 --> 00:13:35,347
What a really, really absurd thing to say!

245
00:13:36,126 --> 00:13:38,562
- I really haven't a clue.
- You're cute, right?

246
00:13:38,563 --> 00:13:41,716
How are you cute?
I'm really, really good looking.

247
00:13:41,717 --> 00:13:43,856
How are you cute?
Tell me how you're cute!

248
00:13:45,388 --> 00:13:47,071
Okay, I get it.

249
00:13:47,871 --> 00:13:50,241
- You are...
- That I'm chubby cute?

250
00:13:50,242 --> 00:13:51,929
- No, that's not it!
- That's not it?

251
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:54,187
That I'm chubby cute?
- No, that's not it!

252
00:13:54,188 --> 00:13:57,886
That's really, really not it!
I'm really, really handsome, aren't I?

253
00:13:57,887 --> 00:14:00,670
- So how are you cute?
- Oh, I'm really, really...

254
00:14:00,671 --> 00:14:03,297
[Time over!]

255
00:14:04,502 --> 00:14:06,336
Is it 'I'm really, really cute?'

256
00:14:06,596 --> 00:14:08,882
'I'm really, really cute, aren't I?'

257
00:14:09,624 --> 00:14:13,295
[Five out of seven members
succeed their mission.]

258
00:14:13,296 --> 00:14:17,587
As mentioned earlier, the two of you,
who did not complete your mission on time

259
00:14:17,622 --> 00:14:20,728
cannot wear your coats during
any of the missions today.

260
00:14:21,242 --> 00:14:23,144
They can just walk around
in each other's arms then.

261
00:14:23,438 --> 00:14:25,268
Maybe this is my chance.

262
00:14:25,269 --> 00:14:27,640
[Monday Couple's story continues on.]

263
00:14:27,641 --> 00:14:31,833
And we have another special guest
who will be joining you today.

264
00:14:31,834 --> 00:14:33,564
- Another guest?
- There's someone else?

265
00:14:33,565 --> 00:14:37,714
Ryu Hyun Jin invited the guest himself
to come and participate on the show.

266
00:14:37,715 --> 00:14:42,494
Do you remember when I got the news of
my draft during my first time on Running Man?

267
00:14:42,495 --> 00:14:46,256
So I have invited someone who
may be getting drafted this year...

268
00:14:46,257 --> 00:14:48,457
[With the possibility of joining
the major leagues in front of his eyes...]

269
00:14:48,458 --> 00:14:51,679
[Republic of Korea's best
shortstop player.]

270
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:55,303
[The man with 40 homeruns and
100 RBI's under his belt.]

271
00:14:55,727 --> 00:14:58,818
[He's here.]

272
00:14:59,292 --> 00:15:02,499
[The man with the five million dollar offer.]

273
00:15:04,274 --> 00:15:07,583
[In the final stages of signing
a deal with the major leagues!]

274
00:15:07,584 --> 00:15:10,859
I've invited Kang Jung Ho, who
may possibly become a major leaguer.

275
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:12,941
['The King of Peace', Kang Jung Ho!]

276
00:15:12,942 --> 00:15:14,955
- Is he really coming on the show?
- I'm a huge fan of his!

277
00:15:14,956 --> 00:15:16,886
Really?

278
00:15:18,555 --> 00:15:22,531
[Future major leaguer, Kang Jung Ho.]

279
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:29,486
[Sports world's latest hot icon!]

280
00:15:31,883 --> 00:15:35,179
- He has a really nice body.
- It's really, really nice.

281
00:15:36,132 --> 00:15:38,273
You really, really are something.

282
00:15:38,274 --> 00:15:41,112
[Welcome!]

283
00:15:41,113 --> 00:15:44,276
My name is Kang Jung Ho
of Nexen Heroes.

284
00:15:46,343 --> 00:15:51,760
He will be the first Korean batter to
join the major leagues, right?

285
00:15:51,761 --> 00:15:53,711
[First Korean batter to face a contract
deal with a major league team!]

286
00:15:53,712 --> 00:15:58,195
I was shocked when I first saw you though
because you look much slimmer on TV.

287
00:15:58,882 --> 00:16:00,749
Wow, look at the size of his thighs!

288
00:16:01,614 --> 00:16:04,295
[Thick as tree trunks!]

289
00:16:04,735 --> 00:16:08,793
You're a kid compared to him.
You're not so tough anymore, are you?

290
00:16:08,794 --> 00:16:12,618
- You're just a kid compared to him.
- Can you do us a favor and take him down?

291
00:16:13,604 --> 00:16:16,508
[Feeling reassured with Hyun Jin
and Jung Ho as their guests for the day.]

292
00:16:16,509 --> 00:16:17,928
We've got a monster batter
and a monster pitcher.

293
00:16:17,929 --> 00:16:21,111
We're the ones who sent
Hyun Jin off to the major leagues.

294
00:16:21,112 --> 00:16:24,514
- What are you talking about?
- Yes, that's right.

295
00:16:25,931 --> 00:16:29,395
- No, we were the ones to send him off.
- He got the news while on our show.

296
00:16:29,396 --> 00:16:34,007
[Received the news of his major leagues
contract while filming the show in 2012.]

297
00:16:34,008 --> 00:16:35,271
I remember that show as well.

298
00:16:36,502 --> 00:16:38,704
[During the filming of the 2012 episode.]

299
00:16:39,495 --> 00:16:41,742
[Fellow senior major leaguer,
Chu Sin Soo saw the news first.]

300
00:16:41,743 --> 00:16:43,310
- Congratulations.
- Is he going?

301
00:16:45,336 --> 00:16:48,998
[Confirmed news of his major league contract
during filming of the show in 2012.]

302
00:16:48,999 --> 00:16:51,323
[Welcomed the biggest moment of
his life with Running Man members.]

303
00:16:51,324 --> 00:16:53,431
- Thank you.
- Seriously?

304
00:16:54,613 --> 00:16:56,889
[25.73 million dollar contract
for Ryu Hyun Jin.]

305
00:16:56,890 --> 00:17:00,072
[Highest paid contract for
a Korean baseball player in history.]

306
00:17:00,301 --> 00:17:03,029
Will you find out the news today?

307
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:05,101
I should find out the news today.

308
00:17:05,102 --> 00:17:06,699
[The day of the filming, December 22,
was the fateful day he joined the ranks.]

309
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:09,069
- I bet you'll get it.
- I feel so nervous for him.

310
00:17:11,413 --> 00:17:12,896
It's not like you're the one getting it.

311
00:17:12,897 --> 00:17:18,977
You must choose the location of your
winter training yourself

312
00:17:18,978 --> 00:17:20,570
and find your own way to that location.

313
00:17:20,571 --> 00:17:24,230
You must think about it carefully as not to
waste any time and remain punctual

314
00:17:24,231 --> 00:17:25,810
so that you can complete your training.

315
00:17:25,811 --> 00:17:30,590
If you fail to do so, then you have to start
your search over until you find it.

316
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:33,782
A total of five people successfully completed
the mission with Ryu Hyun Jin, correct?

317
00:17:33,783 --> 00:17:36,344
- Yes.
-Then you'll be given a 50% chance.

318
00:17:36,345 --> 00:17:40,581
If you see the 'R' flag at the site,
then you've come to the right location.

319
00:17:40,582 --> 00:17:44,060
If you don't see the flag at the site,
then you must hurry to the other location.

320
00:17:44,061 --> 00:17:45,773
- You can take both?
- Yes, you may take both.

321
00:17:45,774 --> 00:17:47,353
[Time to choose the location.]

322
00:17:47,354 --> 00:17:49,692
- Then we have to choose one or the other?
- We'll have to stick together.

323
00:17:52,617 --> 00:17:55,640
Gorae University admin building,
or Dongduk University Main building.

324
00:17:55,641 --> 00:17:57,848
Dongduk All Female University!

325
00:17:58,436 --> 00:18:00,359
[As predicted.]

326
00:18:01,437 --> 00:18:03,121
We think this will be the place.

327
00:18:03,122 --> 00:18:04,649
But Jung Ho thinks it's the other place.

328
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:07,758
- But how do we know...
- This is my third time being on the show.

329
00:18:07,759 --> 00:18:11,262
My guess is...
it's going to be the all-female school.

330
00:18:11,998 --> 00:18:14,984
- That's what I think, too!
- I agree!

331
00:18:14,985 --> 00:18:17,029
[It's one or the other.
What will their selection be?]

332
00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:27,954
- Wow, it's really cold out.
- Gary, are you going to be okay in this cold?

333
00:18:27,955 --> 00:18:30,941
- Ugh, what am I going to do?
- Ugh, it's so cold!

334
00:18:31,564 --> 00:18:34,329
- Ugh, it's so cold!
- Gary, let's just hold onto each other.

335
00:18:34,568 --> 00:18:37,475
[Could this be more of a gift
rather than a penalty for Gary?]

336
00:18:37,476 --> 00:18:38,852
Ugh, I'm cold!

337
00:18:38,853 --> 00:18:41,780
Hurry up and get in!
It's cold out here.

338
00:18:41,781 --> 00:18:43,853
- We're going to Dongduk University?
- Yes.

339
00:18:43,854 --> 00:18:46,985
Should we ask Jung Ho to confirm?
Jung Ho, where are we going?

340
00:18:47,484 --> 00:18:50,819
- I think we should go to Gorae.
- Come on, think again.

341
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:53,952
[Jung Ho, the answer is always
an all-girls school!]

342
00:18:53,953 --> 00:18:55,317
- Jung Ho.
- Yes?

343
00:18:55,318 --> 00:18:59,310
When the majority agrees on something,
you should just go along with it.

344
00:18:59,311 --> 00:19:01,231
[Possible major leaguer's
stubborn streak.]

345
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:08,415
[Nine hours on the clock.
Let's focus and succeed!]

346
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:12,322
Dongduk University...
That's probably right, don't you think?

347
00:19:12,323 --> 00:19:16,620
- It can't be the other place.
- Jung Ho, do you watch Running Man?

348
00:19:16,621 --> 00:19:18,758
- Yes, I watch it often.
- Really?

349
00:19:18,793 --> 00:19:21,861
- When Hyun Jin played baseball...
- Ah, Supernatural Baseball episode?

350
00:19:21,862 --> 00:19:25,104
I was going to come on the show
last year, too.

351
00:19:25,774 --> 00:19:30,106
But I didn't have the kind of pull
that Hyun Jin had.

352
00:19:31,889 --> 00:19:33,614
He didn't have the pull...

353
00:19:33,615 --> 00:19:36,753
- Wait, didn't Suzy come on as a guest, too?
- Yes, for the baseball game.

354
00:19:36,988 --> 00:19:40,159
Suzy even went to throw
the first pitch at Dodger's Stadium.

355
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,394
What did everyone say?
Did they think Suzy was pretty?

356
00:19:42,395 --> 00:19:43,894
- Yes.
- Really?

357
00:19:44,299 --> 00:19:46,627
- I was really shocked at Puig.
- Why?

358
00:19:46,662 --> 00:19:54,037
Koreans I know are pretty bashful and
have a hard time with approaching people...

359
00:19:54,038 --> 00:19:56,406
but he's not like that at all.

360
00:19:56,441 --> 00:19:59,030
He wanted to take pictures with Suzy
as soon as he saw her

361
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:01,147
and he kept touching her head.

362
00:20:01,148 --> 00:20:03,946
- He kept touching Suzy's head?
- It probably caught Suzy off guard.

363
00:20:03,947 --> 00:20:06,856
- I'm sure she was flustered.
- That's what foreigners are generally like.

364
00:20:06,857 --> 00:20:09,815
They're very friendly and
easy to approach.

365
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:13,665
- Jong Kook, Han River is frozen over.
- Yes, it is.

366
00:20:13,666 --> 00:20:15,738
Han River usually
freezes over in the winter.

367
00:20:15,739 --> 00:20:19,105
[Crosses the frozen Han River
to rush over to their location.]

368
00:20:19,397 --> 00:20:21,451
This is the place.

369
00:20:21,452 --> 00:20:24,433
[Finally arrive at Dongduk University.]

370
00:20:25,589 --> 00:20:29,356
[Nine hours on the clock-
Must hurry through the race!]

371
00:20:29,357 --> 00:20:31,501
Where?
Up there?

372
00:20:32,037 --> 00:20:33,936
Please let 'R' marked flag be here.

373
00:20:35,141 --> 00:20:37,039
- This is the place.
- I hope that it's here.

374
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:39,527
- Isn't that the 'R' flag?
- Where?

375
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:43,283
[Off to Dongduk University's main building!]

376
00:20:44,587 --> 00:20:46,403
[If the 'R' marked flag is here,
then they've come to the right place.]

377
00:20:46,404 --> 00:20:49,282
- Is this the main building?
- Yes.

378
00:20:49,283 --> 00:20:51,572
- This is the main building, isn't it?
- Yes.

379
00:20:51,573 --> 00:20:54,674
- What are you here for?
- We're filming Running Man right now.

380
00:20:54,675 --> 00:20:56,058
- Really?
- Yes.

381
00:20:56,059 --> 00:20:57,478
[Jae Suk's coat fur collar
is wrapped around his throat.]

382
00:20:57,479 --> 00:21:00,282
Kwang Soo, I'm too cold to be out here,
so can you call me if the flag is here?

383
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:05,019
It's way too cold out here.

384
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:08,291
You must be students here?
I won't get in your way.

385
00:21:08,292 --> 00:21:10,325
I thought you were our staff members.

386
00:21:10,326 --> 00:21:12,809
Would you like some help?
Let me carry that for you.

387
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:18,423
[Even though the flag hasn't been found,
his priority is to lend a helping hand first.]

388
00:21:19,427 --> 00:21:23,462
- That's not for filming of Running Man?
- Is Running Man not filming here?

389
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:25,496
Where do I need to take this?

390
00:21:25,497 --> 00:21:27,671
Where do you need to take this?

391
00:21:28,937 --> 00:21:30,581
Come here, Jong Kook.

392
00:21:30,582 --> 00:21:32,471
Are there no elevators?

393
00:21:32,472 --> 00:21:34,915
[Help out the students,
and search for the flag, too.]

394
00:21:34,916 --> 00:21:37,950
- I don't see the 'R' mark here.
- No, this isn't the place.

395
00:21:39,292 --> 00:21:41,738
- No, don't mention it.
- You haven't heard we were coming here?

396
00:21:41,739 --> 00:21:43,718
- no.
- Okay, then this isn't the place.

397
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:47,065
- Have you seen an 'R' marked flag around?
- No, I haven't.

398
00:21:47,485 --> 00:21:51,662
Excuse me, but have you seen
any 'R' marked flags around here?

399
00:21:52,423 --> 00:21:54,914
[Not a single person has seen
any 'R' marked flags around here!]

400
00:21:55,805 --> 00:21:58,861
- There aren't any students around.
- I don't think this is the right place.

401
00:21:58,862 --> 00:22:01,615
- The school is on break.
- It's not here. This must not be the place.

402
00:22:01,616 --> 00:22:05,013
- There's no air of excitement here.
- The school is way too quite.

403
00:22:05,014 --> 00:22:06,904
- Everyone's on school break.
- Right?

404
00:22:06,905 --> 00:22:09,226
Then this isn't the right place.
Have a great day.

405
00:22:09,227 --> 00:22:11,762
[No flag! Dongduk University
isn't the right place.]

406
00:22:11,763 --> 00:22:14,753
- This isn't the right place.
- We've got the wrong place, Hyun Jin.

407
00:22:14,754 --> 00:22:18,774
- This isn't the place.
- Then I guess Jung Ho was right.

408
00:22:19,129 --> 00:22:21,093
- Jung Ho was right.
- Really?

409
00:22:21,094 --> 00:22:22,800
Let's get in the car and get going.

410
00:22:22,801 --> 00:22:25,199
Hurry, Jong Kook!

411
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,147
- Seriously!
- It's the other location.

412
00:22:28,633 --> 00:22:32,448
- This is all your fault, Kwang Soo.
- I thought it was the other place.

413
00:22:32,449 --> 00:22:34,708
No, you said this was the place.

414
00:22:34,709 --> 00:22:39,641
- No, I really said it was the other place.
- Who was it? Who said to come here?

415
00:22:39,642 --> 00:22:41,899
- Me.
- It was obvious that it was the other place.

416
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:44,863
Hyun Jin is the one who said
we had to come here.

417
00:22:44,864 --> 00:22:46,747
I really wanted to check out
an all-girls university.

418
00:22:46,748 --> 00:22:48,821
He's never been to an all-girls
university before.

419
00:22:49,129 --> 00:22:51,175
[You should've all listened
to me from the beginning...]

420
00:22:51,176 --> 00:22:52,907
<i>I'm a huge fan of Kang Jung Ho's!</i>

421
00:22:52,908 --> 00:22:55,009
She says she's a fan of yours, Jung Ho.

422
00:22:55,904 --> 00:22:57,993
[Nice fan service.]

423
00:22:57,994 --> 00:23:01,347
Congratulations on MLB!
Good luck!

424
00:23:02,572 --> 00:23:05,872
- Look at the smile on his face now.
- Seriously.

425
00:23:05,873 --> 00:23:08,851
Did you see how quickly he turned
to get a look at his fan?

426
00:23:09,365 --> 00:23:13,521
- Wow, seriously.
- You're like a totally different person now.

427
00:23:13,522 --> 00:23:16,941
[The first big smile on his face
since they started filming.]

428
00:23:16,942 --> 00:23:19,787
He snapped back so quickly when
he heard his name being called out.

429
00:23:30,002 --> 00:23:32,299
I can't believe we picked the wrong place.

430
00:23:34,782 --> 00:23:37,244
- 'R' mark...
- There are a lot more people here.

431
00:23:37,245 --> 00:23:39,089
We need to find the main building.

432
00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:40,578
- There's the 'R' flag!
- Where?

433
00:23:40,579 --> 00:23:42,698
- There it is.
- There's the flag.

434
00:23:42,699 --> 00:23:45,253
[Finally discovers the 'R' marked flag
that they've desperately been searching for.]

[Terrifying Foreign Nine Innings-
Let's go!]

436
00:23:53,290 --> 00:23:55,915
- There's something on the inside.
- Over here!

437
00:23:56,898 --> 00:23:58,099
Here it is.

438
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:00,037
[Finally arrives at the mission site.]

439
00:24:00,038 --> 00:24:02,270
We just went there because
it's an all-girls school.

440
00:24:02,908 --> 00:24:06,128
['R' marked flag isn't going to get
in the way of their primal instincts.]

441
00:24:06,129 --> 00:24:07,948
The 'R' marked flag wasn't
the most important aspect of it.

442
00:24:09,694 --> 00:24:11,137
What is it?

443
00:24:11,138 --> 00:24:13,024
- What is that?
- What is this?

444
00:24:13,025 --> 00:24:16,566
- Is it the same game we played with Ji Sung?
- Maybe they should've thrown it to you.

445
00:24:18,248 --> 00:24:21,302
Terrifying Foreign Nine Innings
winter training.

446
00:24:21,303 --> 00:24:23,223

- It's coming from the ball.

Teamwork reinforcement training.

448
00:24:25,202 --> 00:24:29,959
[2014 Winter Training-
1. Teamwork Reinforcement Training]

449
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:33,580
You must go and bring back a student whom
you'd like to carry on your mission with.

450
00:24:34,574 --> 00:24:37,926
It must be students with the last names
of either 'Ryu', 'Hyun', 'Jin'...

451
00:24:37,927 --> 00:24:40,827
'Kang', 'Jung', or 'Ho'.

452
00:24:40,828 --> 00:24:45,073
Draw a ball and bring back a student
with the last name found on the drawn ball.

453
00:24:45,074 --> 00:24:48,311
Where are we ever going to find a student
with the last name, 'Ho?'

454
00:24:48,312 --> 00:24:51,716
- Seriously.
- Draw the ball and show it to the camera.

455
00:24:51,717 --> 00:24:52,779
[Time to draw for the last name.]

456
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:54,838
It doesn't matter if they see it, right?

457
00:24:56,009 --> 00:24:59,430
- It's 'Kang.'
- Wow, you got lucky.

458
00:24:59,431 --> 00:25:02,418
- You can draw the same last name.
- 'Kang' won't be too easy to find.

459
00:25:02,419 --> 00:25:05,024
- That won't be too hard, I don't think.
- 'Kang.'

460
00:25:05,025 --> 00:25:07,265
Wow, what's with you two?

461
00:25:07,266 --> 00:25:09,596
[They're really connecting today.]

462
00:25:09,979 --> 00:25:11,532
- I'm in trouble.
- Why?

463
00:25:11,533 --> 00:25:13,266
I got 'Jin.'

464
00:25:13,267 --> 00:25:18,062
I hope he gets a tough one.
Ho, Ho, Ho!

[Kang Jung Ho draws 'Jung.']

470
00:25:29,176 --> 00:25:30,976
Yours is 'Hyun.'

[Which last name will Hyun Jin draw?]

473
00:25:36,389 --> 00:25:38,318
- What is it?
- It's 'Ryu.'

474
00:25:40,513 --> 00:25:44,171
- It can't be 'Yoo.'
- No, that's allowed.

475
00:25:44,172 --> 00:25:45,815
- No, it has to be 'Ryu.'
- No, 'Yoo' is acceptable, too.

476
00:25:45,816 --> 00:25:48,091
- No, it's not!
- This isn't a word game!

477
00:25:48,092 --> 00:25:50,915
Who says that I can't?

478
00:25:50,916 --> 00:25:53,641
I'm telling you that it has to be 'Ryu.'
It has to be the name you drew.

479
00:25:53,642 --> 00:25:56,052
'Ryu' is what's written on the ball.

654
00:34:40,833 --> 00:34:45,356
I'm sure you must've been caught off guard
by our presence here during your studies.

- Really? You like to read?
- He's like me.

679
00:35:54,352 --> 00:35:58,691

Then why didn't you just
go home instead?

684
00:36:09,478 --> 00:36:12,234
[Why were you playing a game
in the library?]

685
00:36:13,637 --> 00:36:16,494
- I'm majoring in politics.
- Political science?

686
00:36:16,495 --> 00:36:19,891
She recently broke up
with her boyfriend, too.

687
00:36:21,169 --> 00:36:23,898
So you went out on a blind date to
spite him? Did it go well?

688
00:36:23,899 --> 00:36:25,810

You should talk to her.

695
00:36:46,031 --> 00:36:48,282
How do you feel about L.A.?

696
00:36:48,283 --> 00:36:49,928
[Do you like L.A.?]

697
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:52,097
[She says she already has a boyfriend.]

698
00:36:52,098 --> 00:36:54,516
Here's the game you will be playing
with the partners that you've brought back.

699
00:36:54,517 --> 00:36:56,936
- What's that?
- Are those jump ropes?

700
00:36:56,937 --> 00:36:58,687
What is that?

701
00:36:58,688 --> 00:37:00,634
It's couple jump roping.

702
00:37:00,635 --> 00:37:04,990
You'll have to do some jump ropes
while facing each other.

703
00:37:05,608 --> 00:37:08,620
The couples will take turns
doing the jump ropes

704
00:37:08,621 --> 00:37:11,994
and the nine couple will have to
do a total of 150 jump ropes.

705
00:37:11,995 --> 00:37:15,611
- What? That's absurd.
- Do a total of 150 or more, and you succeed.

706
00:37:15,612 --> 00:37:17,132
[A total of 150 or above to succeed.]

707
00:37:17,669 --> 00:37:21,981
If you succeed within three tries
out of the nine you'll be given

708
00:37:21,982 --> 00:37:23,789
then you'll be given the top best hint.

709
00:37:23,790 --> 00:37:26,765
If you succeed within five tries,
then you'll be given a mid-level hint

710
00:37:26,766 --> 00:37:30,393
and on seventh try or above,
then it'll be the low level hint.

711
00:37:30,394 --> 00:37:32,422
We'll go in the order of our arrival.

712
00:37:32,423 --> 00:37:34,813
- In the order of our arrival.
- Then we'll have to go first.

713
00:37:35,414 --> 00:37:38,955
- We just need to do 15.
- Will she be okay in those shoes?

714
00:37:38,956 --> 00:37:41,819
- Will you be okay in those shoes?
- You should take off your shoes.

715
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:44,061
- She says she's okay.
- Do what you're comfortable with.

716
00:37:44,062 --> 00:37:46,714
Women are much better in heels
than what we men think.

717
00:37:46,715 --> 00:37:49,542
[Each couple will have to do about
16 each to meet the total of 150.]

718
00:37:53,033 --> 00:37:57,295
One, two, three...

719
00:37:57,296 --> 00:38:01,622
four, five, six...

720
00:38:01,623 --> 00:38:03,268
seven.

721
00:38:03,718 --> 00:38:06,771
[Gets caught on Gary's foot.]

722
00:38:06,772 --> 00:38:09,106
- It got caught on your foot.
- No, it didn't!

723
00:38:09,107 --> 00:38:12,051
- You guys were in sync.
- It looked like you could do it.

724
00:38:12,052 --> 00:38:14,340
- Who's next?
- We were second to arrive.

725
00:38:14,341 --> 00:38:16,801
You have to do about 20.

726
00:38:16,802 --> 00:38:19,701
We have six so far.
We have six.

727
00:38:19,702 --> 00:38:22,214
- Ready... set, go!
- We could've done more.

728
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:25,252
- Jump.
- What the heck?

729
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:32,600
[Kwang Soo couple's record- Zero.]

730
00:38:35,087 --> 00:38:38,720
[So the plan was to jump
when he said, 'Jump?']

731
00:38:38,721 --> 00:38:40,860
- What were you doing?
- You didn't understand the plan, did you?

732
00:38:42,903 --> 00:38:45,173
You should've jumped when I told you to.

733
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:49,591
You should've have told her
to jump like that.

734
00:38:49,592 --> 00:38:51,615
- Third couple.
- Seriously.

735
00:38:51,616 --> 00:38:56,018
- Is he stupid?
- What are you two doing over there?

736
00:38:56,294 --> 00:38:59,461
[How are you ever going to jump
if you flip the rope that slowly?]

737
00:38:59,462 --> 00:39:02,918
- Okay, it's Jung Ho and his partner's turn.
- How many do we need?

738
00:39:02,919 --> 00:39:06,231
- More the better.
- 25 or more, if you can get it.

739
00:39:06,232 --> 00:39:08,023
- Can you all move back a little?
- Just do 40.

740
00:39:10,413 --> 00:39:14,795
- Just get us 100.
- Kang Jung Ho, fighting!

741
00:39:14,830 --> 00:39:18,962
[Monster batter, Kang Jung Ho-
He is on the move.]

742
00:39:25,081 --> 00:39:27,628
[Huh?]

743
00:39:28,591 --> 00:39:30,642
[Totally unexpected.]

744
00:39:31,402 --> 00:39:33,743
[He was so confident to start,
but he ends up getting zero.]

745
00:39:33,744 --> 00:39:35,196
[Feeling of betrayal.]

746
00:39:35,197 --> 00:39:37,168
The rope is much longer than
I expected.

747
00:39:37,169 --> 00:39:38,786
Why did you even ask us how
many was needed?

748
00:39:39,262 --> 00:39:44,118
[After asking how many were needed,
who knew it would be a zero?]

749
00:39:45,790 --> 00:39:48,996
- Why even ask us how many was needed?
- You're full of air.

750
00:39:48,997 --> 00:39:51,128
Don't even ask us how many are needed.

751
00:39:52,205 --> 00:39:55,109
[Variety isn't as easy as I thought.]

752
00:39:55,110 --> 00:39:57,993
- We only have six so far.
- The girl is flipping?

753
00:39:58,432 --> 00:40:01,577
- Just watch the game.
- We were practicing.

754
00:40:02,901 --> 00:40:04,933
[The total is still at six-
Jong Kook couple's turn.]

755
00:40:07,946 --> 00:40:09,871
[Better as expected.]

756
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:14,627
Six, seven, eight...

757
00:40:15,933 --> 00:40:19,444
[Jong Kook and partner- seven.
A total of 13 so far.]

758
00:40:20,097 --> 00:40:22,515
Only a total of 14 from four teams.

759
00:40:22,904 --> 00:40:25,654
- A total of 13 from four teams?
- This isn't as easy as it looks.

760
00:40:25,655 --> 00:40:28,154
- Ugh, seriously.
- Don't worry about a thing.

761
00:40:28,155 --> 00:40:32,528
Her father is a 400m dash athlete
and her mother is an 800m dash athlete.

762
00:40:32,529 --> 00:40:33,613
[Comes from athletic parents.]

763
00:40:36,295 --> 00:40:37,752
Ready, set, go.

764
00:40:37,753 --> 00:40:40,929
One, two, three, four...

765
00:40:40,930 --> 00:40:45,327
five, six, seven, eight...

766
00:40:45,328 --> 00:40:47,917
[Wow, in perfect harmony!]

13, 14, 15, 16...

768
00:40:49,984 --> 00:40:51,689
[More than 15 so far!]

769
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:55,498
[Ha Ha's mic falls off!]

770
00:40:55,499 --> 00:40:57,416
No, don't go there!

771
00:41:03,935 --> 00:41:07,674
[Wow, an impressive record!]

772
00:41:08,454 --> 00:41:11,012
- Don't come into the playing field.
- I was picking this up.

773
00:41:11,013 --> 00:41:12,995
[Yellow card for coming into the arena.]

774
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:18,992
- Okay, it's our turn.
- Ha Ha did 27.

775
00:41:18,993 --> 00:41:23,731
- So what's the total so far?
- A total of 40 so far.

776
00:41:23,732 --> 00:41:27,546
40?
Then Yeon and I need to do 50?

777
00:41:27,547 --> 00:41:29,443
- You did really well.
- How many do we have left?

778
00:41:29,444 --> 00:41:31,661
Think of this as our last chance
and let's do this!

779
00:41:31,662 --> 00:41:34,150
[Jae Suk couple's turn.]

780

[Already over 25!]

786

[More than the five previous
teams combined.]

- That was great!
- You did almost 50!

790
00:42:15,176 --> 00:42:18,831
- That was awesome.
- Kang Jung Ho, what was your deal?

791
00:42:19,225 --> 00:42:20,967
[Feeling embarrassed.]

792
00:42:20,968 --> 00:42:23,516

- Yes, I want it slow.

799
00:42:41,784 --> 00:42:43,564
- Slow?
- Yes.

800
00:42:43,565 --> 00:42:45,746
Can you look me in the face just once?

801
00:42:46,477 --> 00:42:49,576
[His partner is too afraid
to look at him in the face?]

802
00:42:49,893 --> 00:42:53,065
- I feel too shy.
- Can you look at me in the face just once?

803
00:42:53,066 --> 00:42:54,668
She hasn't looked at me once.

804
00:42:54,669 --> 00:42:56,663
Does he look like your ex-boyfriend?

805
00:43:01,355 --> 00:43:04,110
[Finally gets the courage
to look at him in the face.]

806
00:43:04,111 --> 00:43:05,866
Ready, set, go.

807
00:43:07,481 --> 00:43:09,520
[Huh?]

808
00:43:16,716 --> 00:43:20,256
[As expected?
Big-nose's record- Zero.]

809
00:43:21,182 --> 00:43:23,963
It's Big-nose's way to continue to do it
even if it doesn't work, okay?

810
00:43:24,510 --> 00:43:26,879
- That's how we do this, okay?
- What are you doing?

811
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:29,413
[Big-nose still hasn't changed
even after five years.]

812
00:43:29,414 --> 00:43:31,764
- Ji Hyo, get this done for us.
- Okay.

813
00:43:31,765 --> 00:43:33,386
[Ji Hyo and her partner's turn.]

814
00:43:33,387 --> 00:43:36,322
[A total of 89 so far.]

815
00:43:36,323 --> 00:43:40,329
[Blank Ji needs to get at least 30
for the success to be even feasible.]

816
00:43:40,330 --> 00:43:42,930
- You can do this, Ji Hyo.
- We needed to get more in the beginning.

817
00:43:43,491 --> 00:43:45,700
- Ready, go!
- Set, go!

818
00:43:45,701 --> 00:43:48,096
One, two...

819
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:59,828
[What is this, a magic show?]

820
00:44:01,568 --> 00:44:04,585
[How did the rope get caught there?]

821
00:44:07,276 --> 00:44:09,814
She lassoed in a man.

822
00:44:09,815 --> 00:44:12,364
[Blank Ji's inescapable lasso.]

823
00:44:12,898 --> 00:44:15,724
With the additional two,
the current count is at 91.

824
00:44:15,725 --> 00:44:17,506
[Blank Ji's record- Two.
A total of 91.]

825
00:44:17,507 --> 00:44:20,142
- Hyun Jin, finish this up!
- Can Hyun Jin get 59?

826
00:44:20,608 --> 00:44:23,202
- He needs to get 59.
- Is he good at this?

827
00:44:23,203 --> 00:44:25,813
- He's really good at this.
- His partner looks good, too.

828
00:44:25,814 --> 00:44:27,933
- Are they good?
- Okay, fighting.

829
00:44:29,835 --> 00:44:31,873
[Starts immediately!]

830
00:44:32,596 --> 00:44:34,838
[Wow, they're good!]

831
00:44:37,313 --> 00:44:40,023
[They messed up the beat.]

832
00:44:40,024 --> 00:44:43,222
- You did it too fast, Chubby.
- No, I didn't.

833
00:44:43,257 --> 00:44:46,412
- They were doing so well, too.
- Okay, this is how you do it.

834
00:44:46,413 --> 00:44:48,457
[First attempt is a huge fail
without even coming close.]

835
00:44:48,458 --> 00:44:53,118
How about the couples
who aren't good go up to the front?

836
00:44:53,516 --> 00:44:55,608
- Let's go, Suk Jin.
- Okay.

837
00:44:57,346 --> 00:45:00,212
[Pretends not to be it, then gets caught.]

838
00:45:01,097 --> 00:45:04,130
- Couples who aren't good.
- There's no change even after five years.

839
00:45:05,036 --> 00:45:07,735
[But...]

840
00:45:07,736 --> 00:45:10,307
Zero have to go up to the front!

841
00:45:11,454 --> 00:45:14,571
[Kwang Soo and Jung Ho attempt
to sneak to the back.]

842
00:45:16,178 --> 00:45:19,843
- Let's go stand next to Jung Ho.
- Who do you think should go first?

843
00:45:19,844 --> 00:45:21,573
- I'll go first.
- Okay, you go first.

844
00:45:21,574 --> 00:45:24,020
- Let's get it done this time.
- Fighting!

845
00:45:26,112 --> 00:45:27,883
We don't have many chances left.

846
00:45:27,884 --> 00:45:30,655
[Attempts to practice with
their hands tightly held together.]

847
00:45:31,649 --> 00:45:34,197
- You don't need to jump that high.
- Do you not like your partner?

848
00:45:37,726 --> 00:45:39,155
Get ready.

849
00:45:39,156 --> 00:45:41,432
Pretend that you're doing this
with your dad.

850
00:45:41,433 --> 00:45:43,663
- Set, go.
- Set, go.

851
00:45:43,664 --> 00:45:47,374
- One, two, three, four..
- Good!

852
00:45:47,917 --> 00:45:50,224
[Oh, what's gotten into Big-nose?]

853
00:45:50,225 --> 00:45:52,724
Eight, nine, ten...

854
00:45:58,578 --> 00:46:01,272
[Second attempt-
Big- nose's record is at 14.]

855
00:46:01,273 --> 00:46:04,386
[Completely unexpected.]

856
00:46:04,387 --> 00:46:07,185
- He did 14, Ji Hyo.
- You did good.

857
00:46:07,186 --> 00:46:10,244
[Not a bad start.
Next up is Blank Ji's couple.]

858
00:46:10,245 --> 00:46:14,622
- 14 is the new expectation.
- Sir, have some ambition, okay?

859
00:46:15,275 --> 00:46:17,749
Your team is in danger, okay?

860
00:46:17,750 --> 00:46:20,114
[Sir, please help us out.]

861
00:46:20,115 --> 00:46:22,402
Set...

862
00:46:23,742 --> 00:46:26,782
- You have to get in the shot.
- What are you doing outside the shot?

863
00:46:30,350 --> 00:46:31,864
- Don't be nervous.
- Okay.

864
00:46:31,865 --> 00:46:34,070
I'm sorry, I was being overly sensitive.

865
00:46:34,862 --> 00:46:36,614
Set, go.

866
00:46:36,615 --> 00:46:38,832
One, two...

867
00:46:39,325 --> 00:46:40,673
Was it me?

868
00:46:42,206 --> 00:46:44,368
[Sir...]

869
00:46:44,369 --> 00:46:46,123
You're first in line now.

870
00:46:46,843 --> 00:46:49,635
[Moved up in line
due to their failing skills.]

871
00:46:50,187 --> 00:46:52,518
- Who's up next?
- It's our turn.

872
00:46:52,915 --> 00:46:55,793
[Next up is Kwang Soo couple-
Another member of the zero club.]

873
00:46:58,424 --> 00:46:59,676
When I jump, okay?

874
00:47:00,547 --> 00:47:05,340
I'm curious to know what Kwang Soo is saying.
Why are you talking your way through this?

875
00:47:05,341 --> 00:47:06,873
[Nation's best known schemer attempts
to talk his way through this, too.]

876
00:47:06,874 --> 00:47:08,894
- Just do it.
- One...

877
00:47:11,245 --> 00:47:12,977
Jump!

878
00:47:13,328 --> 00:47:17,683
[How is anyone expected to do it
to that slow beat?]

879
00:47:20,836 --> 00:47:23,080
We agreed that you'd jump
when I told you to jump!

880
00:47:23,424 --> 00:47:26,351
[The suffering this student is put through
for having met a bad partner...]

881
00:47:27,965 --> 00:47:31,950
[Butt-head Kwang Soo... get in line.]

882
00:47:31,951 --> 00:47:34,691
[The battle for the first place
in line is getting fierce.]

883
00:47:34,692 --> 00:47:37,538
- Jung Ho just made a mistake earlier.
- A total of 17 so far.

884
00:47:37,539 --> 00:47:40,026
[The goal is 150-
A total of 17 so far.]

885
00:47:40,027 --> 00:47:41,847
Show us your skills.

886
00:47:41,848 --> 00:47:43,546
[We have faith in you, Kang Jung Ho.]

887
00:47:43,547 --> 00:47:45,798
- I'll get us to 50.
- There you go.

888
00:47:47,835 --> 00:47:50,421
Look at that expression on his face.

889
00:47:50,422 --> 00:47:52,572
[Always such a determined look
on his face.]

890
00:47:53,326 --> 00:47:58,132
[No more kidding around...
I'll show you what I'm made of!]

891
00:48:01,896 --> 00:48:03,827
[Oh my!]

892
00:48:05,595 --> 00:48:08,997
[Speeds his way to one... and it's over.]

893
00:48:10,434 --> 00:48:14,606
What are you doing?
Are you playing around?

894
00:48:15,976 --> 00:48:19,161
- What kind of jump roping is this?
- What is he doing?

895
00:48:19,162 --> 00:48:20,505
[This isn't what I had in mind...]

896
00:48:20,506 --> 00:48:22,742
He almost fell over, too.

897
00:48:22,743 --> 00:48:25,916
[Monster Batter's plans aren't going
as well as he hoped.]

898
00:48:25,917 --> 00:48:29,270
- Jung Ho keeps messing up.
- Those two look really good together.

899
00:48:29,271 --> 00:48:32,212
- Why do they look so good together?
- Ready, set, go.

900
00:48:35,152 --> 00:48:36,977
[A nice and gentle start.]

901
00:48:39,069 --> 00:48:42,779
[Gets caught on Hyun Jin's foot again
on the seventh jump.]

902
00:48:43,557 --> 00:48:45,417
She's really good.

903
00:48:45,696 --> 00:48:48,414
[If this had been a baseball field...]

904
00:48:48,415 --> 00:48:50,908
A total of 24 so far from
five teams.

905
00:48:50,909 --> 00:48:54,099
A total of 24 from five teams,
and we got 14 of them.

906
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:55,525
[The most shocking part of it all is that
Big-nose couple had 14 of them.]

907
00:48:55,765 --> 00:48:59,197
[How frustrating of these rest...]

908
00:48:59,456 --> 00:49:02,462
We need Gary to get some done for us.
Why are the good ones messing up?

909
00:49:02,463 --> 00:49:05,275
- They were pretty good in the beginning.
- I don't get it either.

910
00:49:05,276 --> 00:49:07,407
She'd seriously be much more comfortable
if she took her shoes off.

911
00:49:09,580 --> 00:49:12,997
- Why are you telling her to take them off?
- Then she'd have to give up something else.

912
00:49:12,998 --> 00:49:15,260
Wow, you're really stubborn.

913
00:49:18,490 --> 00:49:21,678
- Just give her a break.
- Everyone's very sensitive right now.

914
00:49:22,203 --> 00:49:26,371
- Let's leave them be, okay?
- Let's cheer them on.

915
00:49:26,372 --> 00:49:28,365
- I'm just teasing.
- We're all on the same team.

916
00:49:28,366 --> 00:49:29,894
Okay, here I go.

917
00:49:29,895 --> 00:49:31,993
Okay, let's concentrate.
Let's get over the first hurdle.

918
00:49:31,994 --> 00:49:35,925
[Just need to get over the first hurdle...]

919
00:49:35,926 --> 00:49:37,747
Take them off!

920
00:49:37,748 --> 00:49:40,405
I told you to take them off, didn't I?
Is that so difficult?

921
00:49:41,216 --> 00:49:43,893
[The pride she has in her high heels
cannot be broken.]

922
00:49:44,659 --> 00:49:47,760
[Gary's pride is wounded for having
to join the zero club.]

923
00:49:49,465 --> 00:49:51,733
Listen, just pretend that I'm
not even here.

924
00:49:51,734 --> 00:49:53,632
Just think of it as
you doing this on your own.

925
00:49:53,633 --> 00:49:56,499
- I'm not here, okay?
- How is she to do that?

926
00:49:56,500 --> 00:49:58,975
How is she supposed to pretend
that you're not there?

927
00:49:58,976 --> 00:50:01,944
- With as big as you are, too.
- Just think of it as I'm not even here.

928
00:50:01,945 --> 00:50:05,649
[How is she expected to do that
when standing in front of a mountain?]

929
00:50:05,650 --> 00:50:07,310
Just think of it as you
doing this on your own.

930
00:50:07,311 --> 00:50:09,505
Don't you think that you're too big
for her to pretend you're not there?

931
00:50:09,506 --> 00:50:11,984
- Okay, let's go.
- Set, go.

932
00:50:17,265 --> 00:50:19,608
If you're not even there,
then why are you getting caught?

933
00:50:20,551 --> 00:50:22,363
Get over there, and stand first in line.

934
00:50:25,297 --> 00:50:28,553
You're still at 24.

935
00:50:28,554 --> 00:50:31,717
[Which means the remaining couples
needs to do about 60 each.]

936
00:50:33,273 --> 00:50:36,921
[There's still hope with Ha Ha's team.]

937
00:50:37,805 --> 00:50:39,455
Ha Ha was really good.

938
00:51:02,850 --> 00:51:05,213
[Broke through 40!]

939
00:51:10,486 --> 00:51:12,892
[A unanimous ovation from everyone.]

940
00:51:13,621 --> 00:51:16,561
- How many do we have?
- A total of 66.

941
00:51:16,562 --> 00:51:18,615
[With Ha Ha's impressive addition,
a total of 66 so far.]

942
00:51:18,616 --> 00:51:20,629
[But Jae Suk's team is the
only couple left.]

943
00:51:20,630 --> 00:51:22,563
[Needs 84 to succeed...]

944
00:51:22,564 --> 00:51:24,030
You just need to do
almost 100 for us to succeed.

945
00:51:24,031 --> 00:51:26,384
You should be ashamed of yourselves.

946
00:51:27,601 --> 00:51:29,918
[The Zero Club is full of comments.]

947
00:51:29,919 --> 00:51:32,483
- You can do this.
- Even if you each had done five...

948
00:51:32,484 --> 00:51:34,973
- Let's do this.
- It's not that difficult.

949
00:51:47,779 --> 00:51:50,905
[Sped up too much from all the anxiety.]

950
00:51:51,984 --> 00:51:54,507
[The goal is 150-
Second attempt fails at 81.]

951
00:51:54,508 --> 00:51:56,065
This is our last chance
to earn the best clue, isn't it?

952
00:51:56,066 --> 00:51:57,406
[This is their last chance
at the highest level clue.]

953
00:51:57,407 --> 00:51:59,763
[I will show them
what I'm made of this time!]

954
00:52:00,838 --> 00:52:03,429
You have to jump higher than this.

955
00:52:03,430 --> 00:52:05,689
[They must succeed if they want to
finish the race within the nine hour limit.]

956
00:52:06,697 --> 00:52:09,485
[Third attempt-
Kwang Soo couple to go first.]

957
00:52:11,646 --> 00:52:14,114
Just do as you were doing.
Why are you taking off your shoes?

958
00:52:14,723 --> 00:52:17,990
- He's making me nervous.
- Kwang Soo, did you step on a pile of poop?

959
00:52:19,294 --> 00:52:21,357
It's just the color of my socks.

960
00:52:23,027 --> 00:52:25,940
[Trying to liven up the atmosphere
with his attempt at humor.]

961
00:52:26,690 --> 00:52:30,589
[Their final chance at earning
the top level clue!]

962
00:52:34,575 --> 00:52:36,680
[Kwang Soo couple surpasses
the three count mark for the first time!]

963
00:52:38,350 --> 00:52:40,526
[Even surpasses the ten count mark.]

964
00:52:42,824 --> 00:52:45,270
[Much more than expected!]

965
00:52:49,544 --> 00:52:51,548
[Passes the 30 mark!]

966
00:53:00,839 --> 00:53:04,307
[Kwang Soo's record- 39.]

967
00:53:04,308 --> 00:53:05,922
- How many?
- 39.

968
00:53:05,923 --> 00:53:08,452
- We'll go next.
- Okay.

969
00:53:08,965 --> 00:53:12,444
[Next up, Blank Ji and her partner.]

970
00:53:12,697 --> 00:53:14,415
- You can do this.
- Ready.

971
00:53:15,161 --> 00:53:16,739
Set, go.

972
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,143
[What a surprising twist of events!]

973
00:53:24,300 --> 00:53:27,274
[Completely unexpected
from this couch potato!]

974
00:53:28,662 --> 00:53:31,335
[Our Mister is getting into his groove.]

975
00:53:34,665 --> 00:53:36,296
I can't believe this!

976
00:53:39,282 --> 00:53:42,566
[Blank Ji couple's record- 20.]

977
00:53:42,567 --> 00:53:43,985
You got 20.

978
00:53:43,986 --> 00:53:46,304
You should've done that
from the beginning, Señora.

979
00:53:48,594 --> 00:53:51,082
- He finally has a smile on his face.
- They got 20.

980
00:53:51,083 --> 00:53:53,318
He finally has a big smile on his face.

981
00:53:53,319 --> 00:53:54,513
[Next up- Gary couple.]

982
00:53:56,007 --> 00:53:58,559
[The shoes finally came off.]

983
00:53:58,560 --> 00:54:00,849
You should've listened to me
from the beginning.

984
00:54:00,850 --> 00:54:02,969
Everyone take their shoes off right now.

985
00:54:04,019 --> 00:54:06,320
- Get ready.
- Feel the beat.

986
00:54:06,321 --> 00:54:07,824
Set, go.

987
00:54:07,825 --> 00:54:13,367
- One, two, three...
- Much more stable this time.

988
00:54:13,368 --> 00:54:15,323
Seven, eight...

989
00:54:16,095 --> 00:54:17,979
[But the rope gets caught on Gary's foot.]

990
00:54:17,980 --> 00:54:20,145
I really thought we were
going to do better!

991
00:54:20,968 --> 00:54:23,292
Why aren't we doing better?
Why!

992
00:54:23,293 --> 00:54:26,301
[Gary's barefoot record- Seven.]

993
00:54:29,217 --> 00:54:31,713
[Jong Kook couple- One.]

994
00:54:35,568 --> 00:54:36,832
[Big-nose couple- Two.]

995
00:54:36,833 --> 00:54:39,167
You should've counted along with us.

996
00:54:42,034 --> 00:54:45,575
[That was some excuse.
Blaming it on having counted alone.]

997
00:54:49,411 --> 00:54:53,867
[Hyun Jin couple is up next.]

998
00:54:53,868 --> 00:54:57,104
[Six.]

999
00:54:57,105 --> 00:55:03,071
[ A total of 75 so far.
The remaining three teams must get 75.]

1000
00:55:04,219 --> 00:55:06,841
[It's back to being Jung Ho's turn again.]

1001
00:55:09,100 --> 00:55:14,052
I noticed that Jung Ho
doesn't even talk to his partner.

1002
00:55:14,053 --> 00:55:18,905
[Remains silent in the back and
only asks if she's ready at their turn.]

1003
00:55:18,906 --> 00:55:22,718
[Jung Ho still seems bashful
about playing these games.]

1004
00:55:22,719 --> 00:55:25,442
He's trying to be the bad boy.

1005
00:55:25,443 --> 00:55:29,520
[But... there's no more back up now.]

1006
00:55:29,521 --> 00:55:33,603
[This is his last chance to save
his image as the Monster Batter.]

1007
00:55:35,775 --> 00:55:39,767
[I vow to show you all this time.]

1008
00:55:52,204 --> 00:55:54,580
[More stable thanks to her
grabbing on to his jacket?]

1009
00:55:54,581 --> 00:55:57,158
She's actually pretty good.

1010
00:55:57,159 --> 00:55:58,807
[Her skills had been eclipsed
by Jung Ho.]

1011
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:04,363
[Surpasses the 30 mark!]

1012
00:56:05,218 --> 00:56:06,514
Nice!

1013
00:56:07,910 --> 00:56:09,914
[No signs of slowing down!]

1014
00:56:13,907 --> 00:56:15,489
Wow, they broke 50!

1015
00:56:17,593 --> 00:56:20,371
[Grits down on his teeth to keep going.]

1016
00:56:23,639 --> 00:56:26,084
[Best record so far at 64!]

1017
00:56:26,085 --> 00:56:29,292
[Kang Jung Ho does it!]

1018
00:56:29,293 --> 00:56:33,407
[Kang Jung Ho saves his reputation!]

1019
00:56:33,408 --> 00:56:36,374
Kang Jung Ho!

1020
00:56:37,231 --> 00:56:40,024
[Impressive student sticks it through
with Jung Ho to the end.]

1021
00:56:42,362 --> 00:56:44,881
Grabbing onto him had helped.

1022
00:56:44,882 --> 00:56:47,607
[Saves himself in the face
of a variety show.]

1023
00:56:47,608 --> 00:56:49,527
That was good.
That was really good.

1024
00:56:49,528 --> 00:56:50,854
[This is the true face of a champion.]

1025
00:56:51,803 --> 00:56:53,959
Okay, it's all over now.

1026
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:56,130
[With Jung Ho's addition,
they are now at 139.]

1027
00:56:56,131 --> 00:56:58,280
You can't let your guard down, okay?

1028
00:56:58,281 --> 00:56:59,618
Okay, here we go.

1029
00:57:12,732 --> 00:57:16,556
[Clears the jump rope mission.]

1030
00:57:16,557 --> 00:57:19,902
- Jung Ho really won it for us.
- Jung Ho did great.

1031
00:57:19,903 --> 00:57:22,536
[Jung Ho couple brings home the victory.]

1032
00:57:22,537 --> 00:57:25,104
Please take the cards.

1033
00:57:25,105 --> 00:57:28,075
[Next two location cards are given out
upon clearing their mission.]

1034
00:57:30,194 --> 00:57:31,978
Look at Hyun Jin's face.

1035
00:57:33,874 --> 00:57:35,530
Here, you can take one.

1036
00:57:36,681 --> 00:57:41,568
[Only one of these two locations
is the real location.]

1037
00:57:41,569 --> 00:57:44,888
[The clock is still ticking. Pick the
wrong place, and it's time wasted.]

1038
00:57:44,889 --> 00:57:47,816
- It's the bowling alley.
- Let's go to the bowling alley.

1039
00:57:47,817 --> 00:57:51,425
[Which of the two is the correct location?]

1040
00:57:51,426 --> 00:57:52,987
- I think it's the bowling alley.
- I think it's the gym.

1041
00:57:52,988 --> 00:57:56,937
Thank you to all the students
for all their hard work.

1042
00:57:56,938 --> 00:58:00,674
I know it wasn't easy,
but everyone still worked so hard.

1043
00:58:00,675 --> 00:58:03,707
We'd like to thank everyone again
for their participation.

1044
00:58:03,708 --> 00:58:07,228
[A sincere round of thanks.]

1045
00:58:08,639 --> 00:58:11,060
[2014's final winter days-
Terrifying Foreign Nine Innings.]

1046
00:58:13,631 --> 00:58:15,932
[They're back on the road.]

1047
00:58:17,118 --> 00:58:20,820
[Which of the two locations
is the correct one?]

1048
00:58:20,821 --> 00:58:25,465
- Which of the two will it be?
- There's not much we can do at the alley.

1049
00:58:25,466 --> 00:58:29,474
- But I'm leaning towards the bowling alley.
- Which of the two do you think it is?

1050
00:58:29,475 --> 00:58:33,205
- I think it's the gym.
- Let Jung Ho pick it this time.

1051
00:58:33,206 --> 00:58:36,206
[Which of the two will Jung Ho choose?]

1052
00:58:36,207 --> 00:58:39,140
- I think it's the gym.
- You think it's the gym?

1053
00:58:39,141 --> 00:58:40,886
- Okay.
- You think that's the right place?

1054
00:58:40,887 --> 00:58:43,496
[Trusting in Jung Ho's instincts
to head over to the gym.]

1055
00:58:51,874 --> 00:58:56,044
- I can't believe Jung Ho did 64.
- We would've failed without that.

1056
00:58:56,045 --> 00:58:59,104
- That was unbelievable.
- Hyun Jin kept getting tripped on his leg.

1057
00:58:59,139 --> 00:59:03,245
- He's worse than I thought he'd be.
- Well...

1058
00:59:03,826 --> 00:59:07,031
I'm okay with having been bad at it
since Jung Ho did so well.

1059
00:59:07,401 --> 00:59:09,986
I bet I'll be faster
than Hyun Jin at running.

1060
00:59:09,987 --> 00:59:12,381
- Suk Jin jogs around all the time.
- Right?

1061
00:59:12,382 --> 00:59:17,088
- I've seen you run before.
- It's different because I'm a pitcher.

1062
00:59:17,663 --> 00:59:21,530
- Since he has to pitch all the time.
- Pitching like he does isn't easy.

1063
00:59:22,147 --> 00:59:24,611
- He's a genius.
- What about you?

1064
00:59:24,612 --> 00:59:28,083
- I have to keep trying.
- A genius and one who keeps trying.

1065
00:59:28,084 --> 00:59:30,868
He was born with his skills.

1066
00:59:30,869 --> 00:59:34,608
I bet you resent someone with such
natural born skills from time to time.

1067
00:59:34,609 --> 00:59:36,861
- Yes, I totally resent it.
- I can understand that.

1068
00:59:36,862 --> 00:59:40,632
Stop acting like that because
it's annoying.

1069
00:59:41,245 --> 00:59:44,397
[Jung Ho's been born with
natural skills of his own?]

1070
00:59:44,398 --> 00:59:45,802
People from other teams may think
that I don't have to try as hard...

1071
00:59:45,803 --> 00:59:49,105
That's right, you're the same as me.

1072
00:59:49,106 --> 00:59:50,920
But my teammates can see
how hard I have to work at it.

1073
00:59:50,921 --> 00:59:54,127
- They all say that you work hard?
- Then ask people that I know.

1074
00:59:54,128 --> 00:59:56,302
I've asked, and you don't.

1075
00:59:56,745 --> 00:59:58,892
[Ah... you've already asked?]

1076
00:59:58,893 --> 01:00:02,268
- I have to work at it, too.
- A hardworking genius.

1077
01:00:02,269 --> 01:00:04,166
[Jae Suk is a hardworking genius?]

1078
01:00:04,167 --> 01:00:07,362
- A hardworking genius?
- Yes, the scariest kind there is.

1079
01:00:07,363 --> 01:00:09,327
Everyone's kissing your butt right now.

1080
01:00:11,261 --> 01:00:15,158
- I'm a huge fan of yours, Jae Suk.
- I want to grow up to be just like you.

1081
01:00:15,159 --> 01:00:16,747
I'll confess that to you right now.

1082
01:00:16,748 --> 01:00:18,711
I think this is the place.

1083
01:00:19,650 --> 01:00:22,369
[Would Jung Ho have been right,
and will they find the flag here?]

1084
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:26,698
- There's the 'R' flag!
- Do you see it?

1085
01:00:26,699 --> 01:00:27,699
[Immediately discovered the
'R' marked flag.]

1086
01:00:28,688 --> 01:00:31,949
- Kang Jung Ho is the best.
- He got it right, again.

1087
01:00:31,950 --> 01:00:34,447
[Jung Ho's unfailing gut instinct.]

1088
01:00:34,448 --> 01:00:36,211
I thought it would've been
the bowling alley.

1089
01:00:39,898 --> 01:00:42,579
- What is this?
- I think I smell chlorine.

1090
01:00:44,623 --> 01:00:46,583
Wow, what is this?

1091
01:00:48,938 --> 01:00:55,605
[A giant sized bowling lane
on top of the swimming pool.]

1092
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:03,383
[Another baseball command is thrown.]

1093
01:01:03,384 --> 01:01:05,241
Here's your second mission.

1094
01:01:05,692 --> 01:01:09,163
It's control strengthening training.
Human bowling.

1095
01:01:09,984 --> 01:01:15,513
It's a simple game of knocking down the pins
with your bodies as the bowling ball.

1096
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:19,541
If seven of you can get a strike,
then you get the top level hint.

1097
01:01:19,879 --> 01:01:22,473
Four to six people getting a strike
would get you a mid-level clue.

1098
01:01:22,474 --> 01:01:25,163
Anything lower than that will get you
the lowest level hint.

1099
01:01:25,556 --> 01:01:28,762
[Only two hours are left on the clock.
Must succeed as quickly as possible.]

1100
01:01:28,763 --> 01:01:30,706
Should we slide down on our bellies
or on our behinds?

1101
01:01:31,221 --> 01:01:34,462
[They can slide down
whichever way they'd like.]

1102
01:01:36,946 --> 01:01:39,139
We can push you down your butt.

1103
01:01:44,216 --> 01:01:47,185
[The lanes are very slippery.
The never ending slippery lane.]

1104
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:51,154
[Getting the speed and the aim right
are key to succeeding this mission.]

1105
01:01:53,185 --> 01:01:55,991
[The lane is too slippery
to even sit still on.]

1106
01:01:59,120 --> 01:02:00,669
What is he doing?

1107
01:02:00,670 --> 01:02:02,414
[Wait, and I'll save you.]

1108
01:02:06,993 --> 01:02:09,628
[Makes his way over
to take the dive together.]

1109
01:02:11,557 --> 01:02:12,974
Seriously!

1110
01:02:12,975 --> 01:02:15,546
[The human bowling balls gets soaked
before the mission even starts.]

1111
01:02:16,692 --> 01:02:19,558
[Pretends to help out, then...]

1112
01:02:22,725 --> 01:02:25,524
[Yoo-Lee Brothers' warm up method.]

1113
01:02:25,525 --> 01:02:27,274
Let's see who wins this battle.

1114
01:02:27,275 --> 01:02:29,479
[About to exhaust themselves
from doing all their warm-ups.]

1115
01:02:29,480 --> 01:02:31,565
[First human bowling ball- Kkuk.]

1116
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:34,952
[He's reduced to coaching himself now?]

1117
01:02:35,570 --> 01:02:38,216
Or slide down there and kick
with your foot.

1118
01:02:43,770 --> 01:02:45,809
He looks like Lee Sang Hwa.

1119
01:02:51,134 --> 01:02:53,711
[A fierce start.]

1120
01:03:03,914 --> 01:03:05,868
[If only these two would go down!]

1121
01:03:06,425 --> 01:03:09,615
[Strike!]

1122
01:03:10,283 --> 01:03:12,450
I thought he was
Captain America sliding down.

1123
01:03:14,378 --> 01:03:17,741
[Point one- Slide down fiercely...]

1124
01:03:19,575 --> 01:03:22,262
[Point two- Then spread out his body
as wide as it can go.]

1125
01:03:24,365 --> 01:03:29,944
[Point three- And the rest... is pure luck?]

1126
01:03:29,945 --> 01:03:33,209
[Strikes off into a nice start.]

1127
01:03:33,772 --> 01:03:35,985
- Okay, I'll go next.
- Fighting!

1128
01:03:37,726 --> 01:03:40,625
[Hikes up his shorts a tad bit too high.]

1129
01:03:41,239 --> 01:03:44,226
[Gets his hair ready to slide down the lane.]

1130
01:03:46,043 --> 01:03:48,563
[A bit of a partier look
for his bowling slide.]

1131
01:03:51,115 --> 01:03:53,658
[Add in the gaze...]

1132
01:03:54,410 --> 01:03:57,098
[Looks already ready for a strike.]

1133
01:03:59,483 --> 01:04:02,467
[His looks may be enough to take down
the bowling pins on its own.]

1134
01:04:02,468 --> 01:04:04,567
Wow, he's seriously so ugly.

1135
01:04:04,568 --> 01:04:07,241
[Yoo Hyuk's off to a loud start.]

1136
01:04:12,699 --> 01:04:14,215
[Slides off at top speed.]

1137
01:04:18,986 --> 01:04:21,984
[Slides into the camera at top speed.]

1138
01:04:22,635 --> 01:04:25,191
[Fails to get the strike.]

1139
01:04:27,278 --> 01:04:31,800
[One- Glare down at the pins
as if he's going to eat them alive.]

1140
01:04:31,801 --> 01:04:36,526
[Two- Slide down as if
he's one with the lane.]

1141
01:04:36,527 --> 01:04:40,183
[All these moves turns into
a bubble of failure.]

1142
01:04:46,292 --> 01:04:51,383
[The agony of his head smack is felt
even as he pops out of the water.]

1143
01:04:53,592 --> 01:04:55,329
Let's see Kwang Soo go next.

1144
01:04:55,330 --> 01:04:57,196
- You can do this.
- You have to succeed, Kwang Soo.

1145
01:04:58,249 --> 01:05:00,541
You have to do the hair first.

1146
01:05:01,785 --> 01:05:04,731
[Variety styling befitting
of what may be coming up.]

1147
01:05:08,252 --> 01:05:10,335
I vow to succeed!

1148
01:05:13,528 --> 01:05:15,514
[Muttering to himself
about getting a strike.]

1149
01:05:15,515 --> 01:05:17,714
You're looking good.

1150
01:05:19,317 --> 01:05:20,962
[Kwang Soo takes off.]

1151
01:05:28,966 --> 01:05:32,028
[An elegant dive like a mermaid.]

1152
01:05:32,029 --> 01:05:35,857
[If it had been a diving mission,
that would've been a ten.]

1153
01:05:37,235 --> 01:05:39,696
[Mermaid Kwang Soo fails to
get a strike.]

1154
01:05:42,219 --> 01:05:45,920
[Eyes are shooting laser-like beams...]

1155
01:05:47,131 --> 01:05:51,451
[But his body isn't listening to his brain.]

1156
01:05:54,388 --> 01:05:56,651
[Fourth human ball- Haroro.]

1157
01:05:56,652 --> 01:05:59,225
[Transforming himself
into Gary Oldman style.]

1158
01:06:03,658 --> 01:06:06,015
Okay, you're mine.

1159
01:06:06,997 --> 01:06:09,461
[Gary Oldman Haroro's turn.]

1160
01:06:09,462 --> 01:06:11,186
You have to get this done, Dong Hoon.

1161
01:06:13,875 --> 01:06:17,349
[Bowling is not about the mind,
it's all about the heart.]

1162
01:06:27,074 --> 01:06:30,363
[Misses getting his strike by
only one pin!]

1163
01:06:32,973 --> 01:06:35,857
[Aimed perfectly...]

1164
01:06:35,858 --> 01:06:40,470
[And spread out in perfect time...]

1165
01:06:40,471 --> 01:06:45,618
[But his body was too short.]

1166
01:06:47,194 --> 01:06:48,925
I'll do your hair for you.

1167
01:06:48,926 --> 01:06:50,274
[Fifth human ball, Big-nose.]

1168
01:06:53,060 --> 01:06:54,563
He looks ten years younger.

1169
01:06:54,564 --> 01:06:57,283
[Looks ten years younger
with his hair pulled down and forward.]

1170
01:06:58,988 --> 01:07:01,708
[With shoes on both of his hands
as part of Big-nose's plan.]

1171
01:07:01,709 --> 01:07:02,959
Go!

1172
01:07:04,692 --> 01:07:06,752
Why won't you shout it out with me?

1173
01:07:07,378 --> 01:07:10,096
[Big-nose is requesting
for everyone to cheer him on.]

1174
01:07:21,578 --> 01:07:24,426
[A clean strike!]

1175
01:07:26,237 --> 01:07:29,802
[Spreads his arms out like wings
and wipes down all the pins.]

1176
01:07:32,720 --> 01:07:36,280
[A man always full of surprises, Big-nose!]

1177
01:07:42,930 --> 01:07:46,676
[All the young fans are pulled
towards Big-nose as if by a magnet.]

1178
01:07:48,132 --> 01:07:52,460
[But the cold hearted star pushes his fans
aside to climb up on the lane by himself.]

1179
01:07:53,249 --> 01:07:54,947
I did it.

1180
01:07:55,758 --> 01:07:57,587
You have to do it, too.

1181
01:07:58,106 --> 01:07:59,472
Here I go!

1182
01:07:59,473 --> 01:08:00,925
[Sixth human ball- Gary.]

1183
01:08:03,868 --> 01:08:06,278
[A jump slide.]

1184
01:08:07,548 --> 01:08:09,599
Doesn't that hurt?

1185
01:08:10,180 --> 01:08:12,350
[With only seven cleared,
fails to get a strike.]

1186
01:08:12,351 --> 01:08:14,712
- Didn't that hurt?
- Yes, it hurt.

1187
01:08:15,730 --> 01:08:17,605
[Seventh human ball- Ji Hyo.]

1188
01:08:18,243 --> 01:08:20,469
[Slides down as if she's
at the waterpark.]

1189
01:08:22,688 --> 01:08:25,071
[Fails to get a strike.]

1190
01:08:27,645 --> 01:08:29,729
- She's such a girl.
- She knocked down four.

1191
01:08:31,667 --> 01:08:34,017
[Eighth human ball- Jung Ho.]

1192
01:08:34,018 --> 01:08:36,388
[Kang Jung Ho, fighting!]

1193
01:08:37,894 --> 01:08:40,500
- Don't hurt yourself.
- You can't hurt yourself.

1194
01:08:42,521 --> 01:08:46,300
- You've slid into a base before, right?
- Yes.

1195
01:08:47,168 --> 01:08:49,621
He just asked Jung Ho if
he's ever slid into a base before.

1196
01:08:50,995 --> 01:08:53,005
- I'll go.
- Go!

1197
01:08:58,422 --> 01:09:01,248
[A powerful slide.]

1198
01:09:12,210 --> 01:09:14,768
[Turns his direction aside by grabbing
onto the mat like a golden glove champion.]

1199
01:09:15,492 --> 01:09:18,246
[At a 90 degree knockdown.]

1200
01:09:19,215 --> 01:09:21,492
[Bravo, Kang Jung Ho!]

1201
01:09:22,500 --> 01:09:26,260
[Power, Speed, and aim.
A perfect strike.]

1202
01:09:28,069 --> 01:09:30,166
[A standing ovation from the spectators.]

1203
01:09:33,417 --> 01:09:37,672
[The bent leg slide that can only
be seen during a pro baseball game.]

1204
01:09:37,673 --> 01:09:41,749
[And the ability to grab onto the mat
to turn the angle of his slide!]

1205
01:09:41,750 --> 01:09:46,318
[And the total focus to keep his eyes
trained on the target to the very end.]

1206
01:09:46,878 --> 01:09:50,355
[Wishing a sliding run into the major leagues
as fierce as this strike.]

1207
01:09:50,940 --> 01:09:54,023
[The last human ball- Ryu Hyun Jin.]

1208
01:09:55,194 --> 01:09:58,923
[Total of three strikes so far-
If he succeeds, a midlevel clue is theirs.]

1209
01:10:00,724 --> 01:10:02,712
[Monster takes his turn.]

1210
01:10:03,999 --> 01:10:09,155
[Striking out is my specialty!]

1211
01:10:11,292 --> 01:10:13,557
[Monster is on the move.]

1212
01:10:22,059 --> 01:10:24,646
[Monster charges directly
toward the pins.]

1213
01:10:25,381 --> 01:10:27,917
[Their mouths fall open at
Monster's power.]

1214
01:10:33,739 --> 01:10:36,553
[A perfect strike.]

1215
01:10:37,031 --> 01:10:39,409
[Another standing ovation.]

1216
01:10:41,515 --> 01:10:44,319
[This is the monster sliding.]

1217
01:10:47,786 --> 01:10:55,142
[It is number one specialty to get
his fans up on their feet!]

1218
01:10:55,143 --> 01:10:58,775
- Ryu Hyun Jin!
- He strikes out even on the show.

1219
01:10:58,776 --> 01:11:00,801
You're all about the strike!

1220
01:11:02,845 --> 01:11:06,207
[Perfect aim.]

1221
01:11:08,342 --> 01:11:12,369
[Knocks down seven with his legs,
and the remaining three with his hands.]

1222
01:11:15,979 --> 01:11:23,239
[Gets the job done at a crucial moment.
The Ace Monster.]

1223
01:11:23,648 --> 01:11:25,386
It's one of those three?

1224
01:11:25,387 --> 01:11:27,884
[Thanks to Hyun Jin's work,
they earn three possible clue cards.]

1225
01:11:27,885 --> 01:11:30,416
- It's one of these three.
- Okay.

1226
01:11:36,377 --> 01:11:39,373
[Monster strength dumping.]

1227
01:11:41,339 --> 01:11:43,654
[Come here, Kang Jung Ho!]

1228
01:11:44,370 --> 01:11:46,439
[You can climb up here yourself.]

1229
01:11:46,440 --> 01:11:48,563
It's one of these three places.

1230
01:11:48,564 --> 01:11:51,817
- There's not much time left.
- We don't have any time!

1231
01:11:51,818 --> 01:11:53,447
[Not much time left on the clock.]

1232
01:11:53,448 --> 01:11:55,309
Mokdong baseball field.

1233
01:11:56,745 --> 01:12:00,417
- Incheon baseball field.
- They're both baseball fields?

1234
01:12:00,452 --> 01:12:03,060
- Jamsil baseball field.
- Mokdong!

1235
01:12:04,299 --> 01:12:06,714
[Immediately selects
the Mokdong baseball field.]

1236
01:12:13,536 --> 01:12:16,011
- We're heading to Mokdong, right?
- Yes.

1237
01:12:16,012 --> 01:12:20,201
- Why were you so sure that it'd be Mokdong?
- Isn't that Nexen's home field?

1238
01:12:20,202 --> 01:12:22,025
- Yes, it is.
- Mokdong is it.

1239
01:12:22,026 --> 01:12:25,109
- Then it has to be Mokdong.
- Mokdong is Nexen's home field.

1240
01:12:25,110 --> 01:12:27,382
- We've got Jung Ho here. Jung Ho.
- Yes?

1241
01:12:27,383 --> 01:12:29,410
- It's Mokdong, right?
- Yes, it is.

1242
01:12:30,846 --> 01:12:35,361
[Jung Ho and Hyun Jin have been
pretty accurate all day.]

1243
01:12:36,475 --> 01:12:41,025
[The time is running out,
will Mokdong really be the right place?]

1244
01:12:42,843 --> 01:12:44,994
- Is this it?
- Yes, this is it.

1245
01:12:45,523 --> 01:12:50,230
[Final destination spot...
Off to Mokdong baseball field!]

1246
01:12:50,231 --> 01:12:53,361
Why aren't any of the lights on?
The lights should be on.

1247
01:12:53,362 --> 01:12:55,025
[The field is completely dark
without a single light on.]

1248
01:12:56,258 --> 01:12:58,716
I feel like this is the right place.

1249
01:12:58,717 --> 01:13:01,503
- This is Nexen's home field.
- But the place is dark.

1250
01:13:02,333 --> 01:13:04,840
[The closer they get to the location,
more nervous they're feeling.]

1251
01:13:04,841 --> 01:13:07,052
This has to be the place.

1252
01:13:09,281 --> 01:13:13,497
[If this isn't the right place,
then they fail the mission!]

1253
01:13:21,258 --> 01:13:23,699
[There's the 'R' marked flag!]

1254
01:13:25,848 --> 01:13:29,433
[Hyun Jin's guess was right on the mark.]

1255
01:13:29,434 --> 01:13:31,004
Wow, we were right!

1256
01:13:31,005 --> 01:13:33,541
[Final location- Mokdong baseball field.]

1257
01:13:33,542 --> 01:13:36,043
We would've been in big trouble
if this had been the wrong place.

1258
01:13:36,044 --> 01:13:40,326
[Must get up on the mound
as soon as possible!]

1259
01:13:40,327 --> 01:13:42,717
- Run!
- Where? Is it this way?

1260
01:13:42,718 --> 01:13:45,107
- You know the way very well.
- Of course.

1261
01:13:45,108 --> 01:13:48,360
This is where I always
have my jjampong delivered.

1262
01:13:50,104 --> 01:13:55,341
[As soon as they walk through
these doors...]

1263
01:13:55,342 --> 01:13:57,714
[there exists a gift!]

1264
01:13:58,924 --> 01:14:00,402
- What is this?
- We failed.

1265
01:14:00,403 --> 01:14:02,411
- It's dark out here.
- We're too late.

1266
01:14:02,412 --> 01:14:04,543
[The field is dark as night.]

1267
01:14:04,544 --> 01:14:06,376
We're too late.

1268
01:14:06,377 --> 01:14:08,135
- Did we fail?
- We failed.

1269
01:14:08,136 --> 01:14:10,964
- This is the field?
- What's going on here?

1270
01:14:10,965 --> 01:14:15,336
[Did their nine hours run out already?]

1271
01:14:17,672 --> 01:14:20,700
[The mound can't even be seen
through all this darkness.]

1272
01:14:20,701 --> 01:14:23,084
I can't even see anything out here.

1273
01:14:23,906 --> 01:14:29,012
[But just then...]

1274
01:14:33,050 --> 01:14:35,531
[Who are these people standing on the mound?]

1275
01:14:46,783 --> 01:14:54,964
[Standing on top of the mound...
are a bunch of students!]

1276
01:14:56,851 --> 01:15:05,304
[So many students to greet them...
Did they succeed or fail?]

1277
01:15:06,067 --> 01:15:08,248
Did we fail or succeed?

1278
01:15:08,249 --> 01:15:11,522
[Still can't figure out what's going on.]

1279
01:15:12,117 --> 01:15:18,184
Hello, we're the baseball team from
Wondong Middle School.

1280
01:15:18,185 --> 01:15:20,662
- It's nice to meet you.
- Thank you.

1281
01:15:20,663 --> 01:15:23,921
You guys must be so cold.

1282
01:15:23,922 --> 01:15:26,378
- Wondong Middle School, right?
- Yes.

1283
01:15:26,379 --> 01:15:32,147
I'm reading that the school's student body
went down by 20 students in 2010

1284
01:15:32,561 --> 01:15:38,085
and they almost had to shut down their
team. Within only two years in 2012

1285
01:15:38,086 --> 01:15:42,346
they won the 43rd Presidential game
in the middle school rank of the nation.

1286
01:15:42,347 --> 01:15:46,321
[Won the 43rd presidential baseball game
for the middle school rank.]

1287
01:15:46,322 --> 01:15:50,710
[Created the miracle of winning two
national games in a row.]

1288
01:15:51,072 --> 01:15:58,191
They saved the school with their miracle,
and there are now 46 players on the team.

1289
01:15:58,192 --> 01:16:01,844
- Are you the whole student body?
- Yes.

1290
01:16:01,845 --> 01:16:05,051
[The entire student body of the school
is gathered in one place!]

01:16:05,052 --> 01:16:09,672
My name is Yoon Jin Hyuk,
a pitcher and captain of our team.

1292
01:16:11,556 --> 01:16:14,726
Yoon Jin Hyuk!

1293
01:16:14,727 --> 01:16:20,646
It's an honor to meet the celebrities and
the players whom we've only seen on TV.

1294
01:16:22,928 --> 01:16:25,498
- Are you crying?
- You must've been nervous.

1295
01:16:25,499 --> 01:16:28,220
- No, don't cry!
- It's really nice to meet you!

1296
01:16:29,020 --> 01:16:35,002
It's been the dream of these players to
meet Ryu Hyun Jin and Kang Jung Ho.

1297
01:16:36,307 --> 01:16:39,261
Since you made it here within
your time limit

1298
01:16:39,262 --> 01:16:43,281
they were able to meet the baseball heroes
that they've truly wanted to meet.

1299
01:16:43,282 --> 01:16:44,813
Congratulations.

1300
01:16:44,814 --> 01:16:46,306
[Today's race is a huge success!]

1301
01:16:46,307 --> 01:16:49,789
- We had no idea.
- We didn't even have a clue.

1302
01:16:49,790 --> 01:16:51,618
Thank goodness we didn't miss the time.

1303
01:16:51,619 --> 01:16:54,580
[Even though they had no idea...]

1304
01:16:54,581 --> 01:17:00,294
[This is the reason why they ran
and worked so hard all day.]

1305
01:17:00,295 --> 01:17:02,461
It's truly an honor to meet you all.

1306
01:17:02,462 --> 01:17:06,423
I hope that everyone will continue
to practice your skills

1307
01:17:06,424 --> 01:17:11,070
and the most important thing in baseball
is to remain healthy.

1308
01:17:11,412 --> 01:17:15,891
So take care not to get hurt, and
don't ever give up and continue to train

1309
01:17:15,892 --> 01:17:18,332
and I hope to see you all again
in the pro league in the future.

1310
01:17:19,689 --> 01:17:21,416
- Kang Jung Ho?
- That was cool.

1311
01:17:22,152 --> 01:17:26,277
I'm so proud of you all for
having come so far

1312
01:17:26,278 --> 01:17:31,014
and like Hyun Jin just said,
take care not to get hurt

1313
01:17:31,015 --> 01:17:34,647
and I hope that you all become
a hard worker like I am.

1314
01:17:38,679 --> 01:17:42,130
- This is really meaningful.
- Yes, this was a very meaningful race.

1315
01:17:42,131 --> 01:17:45,672
[Heroes of their dreams
have now become their companions.]

1316
01:17:45,673 --> 01:17:47,935
Here's to hoping that you become
an amazing baseball player.

1317
01:17:48,485 --> 01:17:50,734
Congratulations.
Congratulations.

1318
01:17:50,735 --> 01:17:54,596
[A very meaningful race.]

1319
01:17:54,597 --> 01:18:00,490
I truly feel like we've just received
the biggest prize by meeting you all tonight.

1320
01:18:00,491 --> 01:18:07,798
I'm so happy to know that all the efforts
from the day were for these children

1321
01:18:07,799 --> 01:18:10,738
and had we known what was at stake,
we would've worked even harder.

1322
01:18:10,739 --> 01:18:13,826
- Yes, we would've came here sooner.
- Thank you everyone.

1323
01:18:13,827 --> 01:18:16,192
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1324
01:18:16,193 --> 01:18:17,682
[The seedlings of the future dream trees.]

1325
01:18:17,683 --> 01:18:20,907
- How about a group picture?
- That's why we're all standing here together.

1326
01:18:20,908 --> 01:18:25,251
[To our beloved monster, and our
hero heading into the new future...]

1327
01:18:25,252 --> 01:18:26,661
[Fighting!]

1328
01:18:26,662 --> 01:18:29,292
One, two, three, Fighting!
