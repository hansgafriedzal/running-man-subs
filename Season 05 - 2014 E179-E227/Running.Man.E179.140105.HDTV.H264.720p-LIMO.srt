4
00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:15,585
I'm not sure, I don't really remember what
it tasted like the first time I tried it.

5
00:00:15,586 --> 00:00:18,420
All I remember is the sweetness,
and the slight savory taste.

6
00:00:18,421 --> 00:00:20,692
That's the taste I remember in my mouth.

7
00:00:20,693 --> 00:00:23,198
That I believe... was none other than love.

8
00:00:23,658 --> 00:00:27,950

26

Happy New Year.

27
00:01:57,972 --> 00:02:01,556
It seems as though all our members have been
scattered separately in different locations?

28
00:02:03,199 --> 00:02:06,807
[At the same time- Jeonra Station.]

29

00:02:14,494 --> 00:02:16,932
And I've been cast away
by myself somewhere again.

32
00:02:17,424 --> 00:02:19,337
I'm so lonely.

33
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:23,594
[At the same time- Seoul Gimpo Airport.]

34
00:02:24,514 --> 00:02:27,690
[Who's at the airport?]

35
00:02:29,212 --> 00:02:30,932
<i>Did you have some ramen
late last night?</i>

36
00:02:30,933 --> 00:02:33,049
[Gary's face is all bloated from having
eaten salty ramen late the night before.]

37
00:02:33,432 --> 00:02:36,188
[At the same time- Kyungsang Harbor.]

38
00:02:36,682 --> 00:02:39,318

00:02:40,419 --> 00:02:43,954
[Blank Ji is excited
to be back in her hometown.]

40
00:02:45,112 --> 00:02:47,140
I'm back in my hometown today.

41
00:02:47,141 --> 00:02:50,235
This is my hometown's most famous spot
called, the 'Homigot'.

42
00:02:51,064 --> 00:02:54,193
This is the spot where it's said that
the sun rises the earliest in our country.

43
00:02:55,324 --> 00:03:02,173

the sun rises the earliest in our country.]

[We wish everyone the happiest 2014.]

45
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:09,169
[But what is Blank Ji doing here?]

46
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:12,056
There's something else
I want to point out about this place.

47
00:03:12,057 --> 00:03:16,325
I really wish that Jae Suk and
Ha Ha were here with me right now.

48
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:20,457
I bet they'd be shaking in fear right now
if they were to see this.

49
00:03:21,612 --> 00:03:24,098
When I was little...

50
00:03:24,099 --> 00:03:30,320
I used to spend my time by the water here
catching crabs and clams.

51
00:03:31,825 --> 00:03:34,981
This is what I'm very familiar with because
this is the environment I grew up in.

52
00:03:35,572 --> 00:03:39,121
[What reason did Blank Ji have to
come back to her faraway hometown?]

53
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:44,485
[What is the reason for all the members being
scattered separately all on their own?]

54
00:03:46,681 --> 00:03:50,841
Why are you making me feel so lonely by
separating me from the other members like this?

55
00:03:51,261 --> 00:03:52,927
<i>This is your first mission of the new year.</i>

56
00:03:52,928 --> 00:03:55,141
[Time to pass out the first mission
of the new year.]

57
00:03:55,142 --> 00:03:56,345
What is it?

58
00:03:57,913 --> 00:04:00,465
<i>Find your mate inside the gas station.</i>

59
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:03,689
It's not Ji Hyo, is it?

60
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:05,067
<i>You have to go find your mate.</i>

61
00:04:06,257 --> 00:04:07,673
- Is it a guest?
- Yes.

62
00:04:09,528 --> 00:04:11,436
Am I going to get coupled off?

63
00:04:12,076 --> 00:04:15,063
<i>Go find your mate inside the hair salon
who's in there waiting for you.</i>

64
00:04:15,064 --> 00:04:19,567
[First mission of the new year-
Find your mate!]

65
00:04:19,568 --> 00:04:21,643
A mate?
Are we doing our race with a mate?

66
00:04:22,148 --> 00:04:24,215
Am I going to be paired off
with Kang Gary again?

67
00:04:24,752 --> 00:04:26,817
<i>Is it going to be Song Ji Hyo?</i>

68
00:04:27,773 --> 00:04:29,033
Hang on a second.

69
00:04:30,054 --> 00:04:33,056
It's a girl.
This coat is a girl's size.

70
00:04:35,346 --> 00:04:37,264
He's here.
He just came in through the doors.

71
00:04:39,354 --> 00:04:43,278
[Who could Gary's mate be?]

72
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:44,612
I'm nervous.

73
00:04:46,586 --> 00:04:50,324
Who could this person be
that's making my heart flutter?

74
00:04:50,325 --> 00:04:52,997
[Who are the people that are making
these members' hearts flutter?]

75
00:04:52,998 --> 00:04:54,287
Who could it be?

76
00:04:54,288 --> 00:04:57,796
[Jae Suk is searching through the gas station
to find his mate.]

77
00:05:00,496 --> 00:05:02,209
I don't see anyone in there.

78
00:05:04,099 --> 00:05:05,963
Hello.

79
00:05:08,314 --> 00:05:11,415
[Sharing New Year's greetings with his fans
in between doing his mission.]

80
00:05:11,416 --> 00:05:13,173
I'm curious to see who it is.

81
00:05:14,644 --> 00:05:18,152
What if it's Kwang Gyu again?
It can't be, can it?

82
00:05:24,271 --> 00:05:27,022
[The back of his head...]

83
00:05:27,582 --> 00:05:29,613
Seriously?
It's him?

84
00:05:30,148 --> 00:05:32,537
[Immediate disappointment?]

85
00:05:32,538 --> 00:05:34,078
Come out here, Soo Hong.

86
00:05:34,696 --> 00:05:36,657
Excuse me.
I said, come out here, Soo Hong.

87
00:05:36,658 --> 00:05:38,627
What are you... seriously?

88
00:05:39,216 --> 00:05:41,985
- What are you doing here?
- Shouldn't you be shocked and surprised?

89
00:05:42,484 --> 00:05:46,300
[Jae Suk's mate- Park Soo Hong.]

90
00:05:46,301 --> 00:05:49,722
- I can't believe it's him.
- I don't like being stuck with you either.

91
00:05:49,723 --> 00:05:51,996
- Come here. Come here right now.
- Can't you at least say 'hi'?

92
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:56,363
[Their 20 years plus of friendship leads
to bickering the moment they see each other.]

93
00:05:56,364 --> 00:05:58,782
- Sorry for all this.
- Thank you for everything.

94
00:05:58,783 --> 00:06:01,994
- Please excuse us.
- Do you want to take a picture with me first?

95
00:06:01,995 --> 00:06:03,449
Hurry up and get out here.

96
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:05,329
- What's going on?
- What are you doing here?

97
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:09,077
They went to the trouble of letting me hide,
so I at least wanted her to get a picture.

98
00:06:09,078 --> 00:06:11,327
Why do you want her to take a picture with
you when she doesn't even want one?

99
00:06:11,328 --> 00:06:13,671
- I just wanted to be considerate.
- That's not being considerate.

100
00:06:13,672 --> 00:06:16,156
- Then you should've just taken one.
- Jae Suk.

101
00:06:16,157 --> 00:06:19,506
- Don't you know how to greet someone?
- There you go again.

102
00:06:19,778 --> 00:06:22,997
They told me that it was going to be
a couple race and I got Park Soo Hong.

103
00:06:22,998 --> 00:06:25,323
I thought it would be someone better.
Why does it have to be you of all people?

104
00:06:25,324 --> 00:06:28,431
- Anyways, good to see you.
- Right?

105
00:06:28,432 --> 00:06:31,747
To introduce him briefly, he's
an old friend whom I like considerably.

106
00:06:31,748 --> 00:06:34,210
Also, Happy New Year to all our viewers.

107
00:06:34,211 --> 00:06:36,494
My partner is Park Soo Hong.

108
00:06:36,495 --> 00:06:38,046
He's an old bachelor.

109
00:06:38,047 --> 00:06:39,518
He's past the old bachelor status.

110
00:06:39,787 --> 00:06:42,895
You can just think of him as an icon of all
the old single men who live by themselves.

111
00:06:42,896 --> 00:06:45,781
He and I graduated college together
back in 1991.

112
00:06:45,782 --> 00:06:48,899
He's two years older than me.
He is the sign of the dog, born in 1970.

113
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:52,590
[Soo Hong isn't able to say a word
as Jae Suk does all the introduction for him.]

114
00:06:52,591 --> 00:06:54,793
I can't believe I'm partnered up with you.

115
00:06:55,249 --> 00:06:57,079
What?
I'm right.

116
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:02,458
And since we're now in year the 2014,
he is now 45 years old.

117
00:07:02,459 --> 00:07:06,033
He has five years left
before he turns 50 years old.

118
00:07:06,034 --> 00:07:10,727
He is a very dear friend of mine.
Say hello, and wish everyone a happy new year.

119
00:07:10,728 --> 00:07:13,128
- I've already given your introduction.
- You call that an introduction?

120
00:07:13,484 --> 00:07:15,580
Am I just here for comic relief?

121
00:07:15,581 --> 00:07:18,551
Shouldn't you let me talk since
I'm on the show as a guest?

122
00:07:18,552 --> 00:07:20,200
- I am talking to you.
- That's not talking.

123
00:07:20,201 --> 00:07:23,057
It's true that things are going well for you
since you're such a chatterbox...

124
00:07:23,057 --> 00:07:25,197
- But are you kidding?
- He loves to cook.

125
00:07:25,782 --> 00:07:27,922
He also loves to go clubbing.

126
00:07:27,923 --> 00:07:32,646
Even though he did tell me that he will
continue to go clubbing in the new year

127
00:07:32,647 --> 00:07:37,052
it's still nice to see him out and about,
especially as a guest on our show.

128
00:07:37,053 --> 00:07:38,083
- It's good to see you, Soo Hong.
- Jae Suk.

129
00:07:38,084 --> 00:07:41,760
My partner is, Park Soo Hong.
This is Running Man's first episode of 2014.

130
00:07:41,761 --> 00:07:43,111
[Anyways, please meet Jae Suk's partner,
Park Soo Hong.]

131
00:07:44,108 --> 00:07:47,088
[Then who's Ji Hyo's partner?]

132
00:07:47,861 --> 00:07:49,529
Partner!

133
00:07:52,995 --> 00:07:55,784
Have you seen anyone who's dressed
in the same outfit as I am?

134
00:07:55,785 --> 00:08:00,086
[She sees someone in the distance who's
dressed in the same outfit as she is?]

135
00:08:02,869 --> 00:08:06,663
[Even just the silhouette suggests
that the partner is a man.]

136
00:08:06,664 --> 00:08:10,414
[Who is this man,
who's to be Ji Hyo's partner?]

137
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:12,473
[Who could it be?]

138
00:08:12,474 --> 00:08:13,896
Partner.

139
00:08:18,321 --> 00:08:22,029
[Ji Hyo's partner- Lee Dong Wook.]

140
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:24,344
[I know who it is!]

141
00:08:24,555 --> 00:08:26,982
Lee Dong Wook!

142
00:08:26,983 --> 00:08:29,599
[Friends of the same age
that she recognizes at once.]

143
00:08:30,027 --> 00:08:31,355
Lee Dong Wook!

144
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:35,572
[Friend!]

145
00:08:35,573 --> 00:08:42,448
[So happy to see a friend
in my own hometown.]

146
00:08:43,236 --> 00:08:48,158
- Good to see you, Dong Wook. Happy New Year.
- Same to you.

147
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:52,241
We were in a recent drama together,
and he played a married man I had a crush on.

148
00:08:52,242 --> 00:08:54,810
[Dong Wook played married man in a drama that
Blank Ji chased after in their recent drama.]

149
00:08:54,811 --> 00:08:56,561
- Good to see you, Dong Wook.
- It's good to see you too.

150
00:08:56,562 --> 00:09:00,041
[Reunited as partners.]

151
00:09:00,786 --> 00:09:03,342
- There's something that I'm curious about.
- Okay.

152
00:09:03,343 --> 00:09:05,293
Why did we come all the way here?

153
00:09:05,944 --> 00:09:09,358
We're here... to sight-see.

154
00:09:09,359 --> 00:09:11,634
Isn't it nice?
Look over there.

155
00:09:11,635 --> 00:09:14,919
- Look at how beautiful it is here.
- You need to do a better job.

156
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:17,559
Why are you making me carry
our segment of the show?

157
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,842
[These two friends immediately bicker
back and forth as well.]

158
00:09:19,843 --> 00:09:22,754
- Wish everyone a happy new year.
- How about a grand bow to our viewers?

159
00:09:22,755 --> 00:09:23,797
- Right here?
- Of course.

160
00:09:23,798 --> 00:09:25,791
- Right here?
- Where else would we do it?

161
00:09:26,289 --> 00:09:29,760
Happy New Year to all our viewers.

162
00:09:38,294 --> 00:09:41,161
- Please look kindly upon me in the new year.
- We wish you all a year full of good health.

163
00:09:41,162 --> 00:09:45,107
Please give a lot of support to Running Man,
and to Dong Wook as well.

164

for my hometown as well.

[Big-nose is waiting for his partner in front
of his partner's home.]

166
00:09:58,102 --> 00:09:59,974
You have a very nice figure.

167
00:10:01,133 --> 00:10:02,408
Who are you?

168
00:10:03,715 --> 00:10:07,413
[This person is...]

169
00:10:07,414 --> 00:10:10,682
[With her long lean legs...]

170
00:10:10,683 --> 00:10:14,513
[And long straight hair?]

171
00:10:14,514 --> 00:10:18,093
[And a slender body to boot?
Who could Big-nose's partner be?]

172
00:10:19,842 --> 00:10:21,465
Are you a man or a woman?

173
00:10:21,466 --> 00:10:24,799
[Who could it be?]

174
00:10:29,342 --> 00:10:32,034
[Big-nose's partner is the total opposite
of what he was expecting!]

175
00:10:32,687 --> 00:10:35,429
[Suk Jin's partner- Kim Kyung Ho.]

176
00:10:35,994 --> 00:10:39,248
I had really high hopes when I saw
your long flowy hair.

177
00:10:39,249 --> 00:10:41,892
- Did I disappoint you?
- No, you didn't disappoint me.

178
00:10:42,392 --> 00:10:44,506
- You sure?
- Okay, just a little.

179
00:10:45,575 --> 00:10:48,604
- Have you been well?
- I'm starting off 2014 with Kim Kyung Ho.

180
00:10:48,605 --> 00:10:51,542
- It's nice to see you.
- Really good to see you. It's been too long.

181

[Kwang Soo is waiting with anticipation
for his partner as well.]

Park?

183
00:11:00,708 --> 00:11:02,475
What are you doing here?

184

[John Park?
The Idiot Brothers are reunited?]

[Kwang Soo's partner- John Park.]

186
00:11:10,473 --> 00:11:12,478
Kwang-Park-Cross!

187
00:11:13,046 --> 00:11:15,847
- I've gotten better, haven't I?
- You must've been practicing a lot.

188
00:11:15,848 --> 00:11:18,126
[John seems to have practiced their
teams' battle cry.]

189

[Who's Gary's partner whose been waiting
for him at the airport?]

190
00:11:24,969 --> 00:11:30,451
[Gary's partner- Rainbow's Jae Kyung.]

191
00:11:30,452 --> 00:11:32,412
I can't believe that
I'm partnered with Jae Kyung.

192
00:11:33,911 --> 00:11:35,779
You guys have been too kind to me.

193
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:38,941
You're so pretty, Jae Kyung.

194
00:11:38,942 --> 00:11:40,345
Thank you.

195
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:45,139
Can he be any more obvious?

196
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:48,751
What is he doing?
Why is he being so obvious?

197
00:11:52,259 --> 00:11:55,772
Listen to that voice!
I bet he's an actor.

198
00:11:56,683 --> 00:11:58,543
Pretty impressive.

199
00:11:58,544 --> 00:12:00,689
Sir!
It's nice to meet you.

200
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,337
[Ha Ha's partner- Infinite's Sung Kyu.]

201
00:12:12,047 --> 00:12:13,572
You and I are a team?

202
00:12:13,573 --> 00:12:16,265
This is a good match.
He and I are a good fit.

203
00:12:16,266 --> 00:12:18,285
- This is actually my hometown.
- Seriously?

204
00:12:18,286 --> 00:12:21,465
[They find out that Jeonju is
Sung Kyu's actual hometown!]

205
00:12:21,466 --> 00:12:23,172
- I know this area very well.
- Hello everyone.

206
00:12:23,173 --> 00:12:26,897
Did you know that Infinite's Sung Kyu
originates from Jeonju?

207
00:12:28,318 --> 00:12:31,873
- No one knew.
- I don't think they even know who I am.

208
00:12:32,247 --> 00:12:34,267
How can this even be possible?

209
00:12:35,469 --> 00:12:38,449
[Last but not least, who's Kkuk's partner?]

210

[Cautiously walks into the hair salon.]

211
00:12:45,305 --> 00:12:48,914
If it's someone who's getting their
hair done at the salon at this hour...

212
00:12:51,693 --> 00:12:55,300
[Someone does seem to be in the room...]

213
00:13:14,163 --> 00:13:16,479
Is she... my partner?

214
00:13:17,023 --> 00:13:18,959
That model in there?

215
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:21,984
[That's the world famous model,
Song Kyung Ah...]

216
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:26,817
[Is she... or isn't she?]

217
00:13:29,609 --> 00:13:30,923
Hello.

218
00:13:31,754 --> 00:13:33,570
By any chance...

219

- Are you here to be a guest on Running Man?
- No, I'm here to prep for a photo-shoot.

220

I see, I'm sorry.

221
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:42,785
I apologize for the intrusion.

222
00:13:42,786 --> 00:13:45,292
I thought you were here for Running Man.
You're a famous model, right?

223
00:13:45,293 --> 00:13:46,634
Yes.

224
00:13:48,866 --> 00:13:50,545
She's not the one.

225
00:13:51,779 --> 00:13:54,454
[I was told that my partner
would be in here...]

226
00:13:56,357 --> 00:13:59,756
Is someone who's supposed to guest on
Running Man in here right now?

227
00:14:00,168 --> 00:14:02,303
Are you here to guest on Running Man?

228
00:14:02,901 --> 00:14:05,598
[Even asking the salon clients...]

229
00:14:05,599 --> 00:14:08,217
Wait a minute.
I see some things in here.

230
00:14:10,969 --> 00:14:12,419
I guess not.

231
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:14,323
Are you a photographer?

232
00:14:15,872 --> 00:14:17,058
[How strange...]

233
00:14:17,059 --> 00:14:19,018
Excuse me.
Sorry to bother you again.

234
00:14:20,052 --> 00:14:22,001
But it's just that there's
no one else in here.

235
00:14:22,002 --> 00:14:24,127
I was told that someone would be in here.

236
00:14:24,128 --> 00:14:27,850
I was told that my partner would be in here.
Sorry, but I'm sure I'll be back again later.

237
00:14:29,151 --> 00:14:30,700
This is really strange.

238
00:14:32,536 --> 00:14:34,183
No one else is in here.

239
00:14:38,516 --> 00:14:42,347
[Where's my partner?]

240
00:14:42,348 --> 00:14:46,744
[Carefully searching through every inch
and corner of the salon for his partner.]

241
00:14:49,923 --> 00:14:54,560
[That's so strange...
There's no one else in here...]

[Back to Song Kyung Ah's room
for the third time.]

243

- It's just that there's no one else...
- I'm actually here for a Running Man shoot.

244
00:15:01,294 --> 00:15:03,374
- Hello.
- Yes, hello!

245

[Jong Kook's partner- Song Kyung Ah.]

246
00:15:07,471 --> 00:15:09,796
She really is a world famous model.

247
00:15:09,797 --> 00:15:14,448
[Kkuk was completely fooled by the joke
played by the world famous model.]

248
00:15:14,629 --> 00:15:16,979
Wow, but you really are...

249
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:19,246
- She really is very tall.
- I'm sorry, but I wore my heels today.

250
00:15:19,247 --> 00:15:21,412
- I'm sorry for making you feel uncomfortable.
- No, it's okay.

251
00:15:21,413 --> 00:15:23,866
- No, I'm not bothered by it whatsoever.
- He keeps backing away from me.

252
00:15:23,992 --> 00:15:26,864
- But if I stand too close to you...
- You keep backing away from me.

253
00:15:31,069 --> 00:15:34,371
Can you guys pose for a picture together
since you two are a team?

254
00:15:34,372 --> 00:15:37,875
Can we do the picture once she
changes out of her clothes?

255
00:15:40,694 --> 00:15:42,607
We're starting the mission by ourselves?

256
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:45,207
[It's an all day mission
with just their partner only.]

257
00:15:45,909 --> 00:15:48,295
Are we going to be spies or something?

258
00:15:48,296 --> 00:15:51,765
I've been waiting for a day like that to come
for the past three years, but...

259
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,567
Oh! We've got a text.

260
00:15:55,314 --> 00:15:58,481
[Everyone gets a text message regarding
their mission at the same time.]

261

has risen again.</i>

for the year 2014...</i>

- It's Running Man's 2014 Cooking Battle.
- Cooking battle?

264
00:16:09,277 --> 00:16:10,785
What?
A cooking battle?

265
00:16:11,425 --> 00:16:14,257
[Soo Hong has yet to even say a word.]

266
00:16:15,343 --> 00:16:17,113
- A cooking battle?
- A cooking battle.

267
00:16:19,172 --> 00:16:21,041
- Are you a good cook?
- I'm a really good cook.

268
00:16:21,042 --> 00:16:23,601
- I'm really good at cooking.
- You know how to cook?

269
00:16:23,602 --> 00:16:26,004
- You're a good cook, right?
- I can't cook.

270
00:16:26,731 --> 00:16:28,685
- You can't cook?
- Are you a good cook?

271
00:16:29,082 --> 00:16:31,299
I don't really know how to cook.

272
00:16:31,489 --> 00:16:34,382
Along with your partner... partner.

273
00:16:35,407 --> 00:16:39,044
<i>The team that wins at the final judging
of your cooking wins the entire race.</i>

274
00:16:39,306 --> 00:16:43,037
The theme of your cooking is,
'2014's first dinner menu'.

275
00:16:43,038 --> 00:16:47,158
Please make a dish that you'd most
like to eat as your dish for the competition.

276
00:16:47,159 --> 00:16:48,721
- Nangmyun.
- When the competition...

277
00:16:49,086 --> 00:16:51,778
[Simple 'nangmyun mania'.]

278
00:16:51,779 --> 00:16:53,617
The cooking competition will start
at seven o'clock this evening.

279
00:16:53,618 --> 00:16:57,554
You'll only be able to participate if you can
get all the secrets and ingredients by then.

280
00:16:57,555 --> 00:17:01,083
We will now start our
2014 Running Man Cooking Battle.

281
00:17:01,084 --> 00:17:04,023
- Go!
- Go!

282
00:17:05,773 --> 00:17:10,694
[First dinner of 2014!
What is the one dish that you'd want to have?]

283
00:17:11,653 --> 00:17:16,160
[2014 Running Man Cooking Contest.]

284
00:17:18,656 --> 00:17:22,902
[Winner's prize- Two golden horses.]

285
00:17:22,903 --> 00:17:27,228
- Is that real gold?
- Is there an 'R' stamped on it?

286
00:17:28,364 --> 00:17:31,223
This is amazing.
This really is an amazing prize item.

287
00:17:31,658 --> 00:17:34,174
Then we each get one of these horses
if we win the battle?

288
00:17:34,175 --> 00:17:36,749
We each get one.
We each get one of these.

289
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:38,505
[The power of the golden horses
filling them with motivation.]

290
00:17:38,506 --> 00:17:40,201
Aren't you pretty good at cooking?

291
00:17:40,202 --> 00:17:43,667
[Kyung Ho's known
for his talented cooking skills.]

292
00:17:43,668 --> 00:17:46,060
I'm not very good at making the dishes
that I make look pretty.

293
00:17:46,061 --> 00:17:50,078
But I'm really good at making
the dishes taste pretty good.

294
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:52,257
The most important thing is
making these dishes taste good.

295
00:17:52,258 --> 00:17:54,557
What good is it to have it look pretty
if it doesn't even taste good?

296
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:56,956
- Oh... cooking?
- Aren't you a good cook?

297
00:17:57,132 --> 00:18:02,046
I do like to cook... but food directly
correlates to how you look.

298
00:18:02,047 --> 00:18:03,952
So I do have a lot of interest in food.

299
00:18:03,953 --> 00:18:06,618
- Yes, I have a lot of interest in it as well.
- Yes, your physique shows it.

300
00:18:06,619 --> 00:18:08,692
[Yes, we know.
We know that all too well.]

301
00:18:08,693 --> 00:18:12,236
- In that case... shall we go get going?
- Yes.

302
00:18:12,237 --> 00:18:14,268
- My mom is a chef.
- Seriously?

303
00:18:14,269 --> 00:18:16,421
[Jae Kyung's mother is a chef!]

304
00:18:16,422 --> 00:18:19,314
- Then you must be a good cook?
- I do like to cook.

305
00:18:19,609 --> 00:18:21,204
That implies that you haven't
had a lot of experience with cooking.

306
00:18:21,205 --> 00:18:23,940
- I'm in charge of the cooking at the dorm.
- Really?

307
00:18:23,941 --> 00:18:25,319
[All of the guests seem to be
pretty familiar with food.]

308
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,260
Soo Hong.
You're a good cook, aren't you?

309
00:18:27,897 --> 00:18:32,587
This whole morning since
we've found each other...

310
00:18:33,136 --> 00:18:35,926
There's not a single thing that I've
been able to say or do of my own accord.

311
00:18:35,927 --> 00:18:37,374
- That's what variety shows are like.
- Hello to all the viewers out there.

312
00:18:37,375 --> 00:18:41,791
I was told that things are going to go my way
when I had my fortunes read for the new year.

313
00:18:41,792 --> 00:18:45,175
- But I don't know if they were right.
- It's because we're filming this in 2013.

314
00:18:45,176 --> 00:18:48,236
I'm sure that things are different
because this episode is being filmed in 2013.

315
00:18:48,237 --> 00:18:50,567
Since this is still technically 2013,
you'll have to wait until next year.

316
00:18:50,568 --> 00:18:52,431
Then today must be my last day
of bad luck.

317
00:18:52,432 --> 00:18:54,115
So that's why I haven't been
able to talk at all.

318
00:18:54,116 --> 00:18:57,376
I can't believe I'm with someone who won't
even allow me to speak when I'm the guest.

319
00:18:57,377 --> 00:19:00,161
But Soo Hong... aren't you the best
when it comes to cooking?

320
00:19:00,162 --> 00:19:01,816
Soo Hong really is an amazing cook.

321
00:19:01,993 --> 00:19:04,272
Don't you even have a certificate?
In traditional Korean cooking?

322
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:07,625
- Can't I just talk for myself?
- Sure, go ahead and talk.

323
00:19:07,626 --> 00:19:10,180
Yes, I do have a certificate for traditional
Korean cooking, which is difficult to earn.

324
00:19:10,181 --> 00:19:11,858
- Don't you have another one?
- Like what?

325
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:14,065
Don't you have any certificates other
than just your Korean cooking certificate?

326
00:19:14,124 --> 00:19:15,884
- No, I don't.
- You only have that one thing?

327
00:19:15,885 --> 00:19:17,419
Which level is your certificate?

328
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:19,297
There are no levels.
It's just a certificate.

329
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,323
Are you doubting me right now?

330
00:19:21,874 --> 00:19:23,461
I'm just going to leave
if this is how you're going to be.

331
00:19:23,462 --> 00:19:25,663
- I'm not doing it. I'm not doing the show
- Sorry. I didn't mean it.

332
00:19:26,403 --> 00:19:30,261
- I can't believe you're getting pissy.
- I'm not getting pissy, but you're...

333
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:33,214
He never used to be like this
when he was in his twenties.

334
00:19:33,215 --> 00:19:36,080
But ever since he turned 40,
he gets pissy at the drop of a hat.

335
00:19:36,081 --> 00:19:38,921
So we're teamed up together
until seven o'clock tonight?

336
00:19:38,922 --> 00:19:42,248
<i>You have until then to gather all the methods
and ingredients that you'll be needing.</i>

337
00:19:42,249 --> 00:19:45,305
<i>We've already determined your
genre for you.</i>

338
00:19:45,306 --> 00:19:46,692
<i>And your ingredient is...</i>

339
00:19:47,266 --> 00:19:50,441
<i>Fish.</i>

340
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:53,426
- Fish?
- Fish?

341
00:19:53,427 --> 00:19:55,194
Is there any dish you know how
to cook with fish?

342
00:19:55,195 --> 00:19:56,574
- Fish?
- Yeah.

343
00:19:56,575 --> 00:19:57,673
Sushi.

344
00:19:59,279 --> 00:20:02,780
Even though sushi is nice, you need
something warm for the dinner table.

345
00:20:03,084 --> 00:20:05,020
- Soup.
- Soup... soup.

346
00:20:05,021 --> 00:20:06,543
You keep trying to take over.

347
00:20:07,005 --> 00:20:08,794
We're partners here.

348
00:20:08,795 --> 00:20:13,698
<i>We've prepared a car for you,
so go where you can get the fish you need.</i>

349
00:20:13,699 --> 00:20:15,891
- You can eat too if you're hungry.
- Should we go eat something, Soo Hong?

350
00:20:15,892 --> 00:20:17,413
You haven't eaten anything yet, have you?

351
00:20:17,414 --> 00:20:18,930
You just go eat yourself.

352
00:20:18,931 --> 00:20:21,021
- You're not going to eat?
- I think eating now will upset my stomach.

353
00:20:21,022 --> 00:20:22,502
- Why?
- Because of you.

354
00:20:23,653 --> 00:20:24,973
You're upsetting my stomach.

355
00:20:24,974 --> 00:20:28,945
- It's because of the way you introduced me.
- Then how else was I supposed to do it?

356
00:20:28,946 --> 00:20:33,443
- I was just telling them how old you were.
- Have you always been such a fast talker?

357
00:20:33,444 --> 00:20:36,371
- You didn't know that?
- I can't even handle it.

358
00:20:36,372 --> 00:20:38,236
How else was I supposed to say all that
if I were to talk slow?

359
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:41,337
We don't even have a lot of screen time.
There are a total of seven teams.

360
00:20:41,338 --> 00:20:44,391
Just think about there being seven teams.
Just a minute alone would be seven minutes

361
00:20:44,392 --> 00:20:45,816
and ten minutes per team
would equal 70 minutes.

362
00:20:45,817 --> 00:20:47,842
So we don't have a lot of time.
That's why we have to talk fast.

363
00:20:47,843 --> 00:20:50,196
- Let's come. Come this way.
- Then let's go eat something.

364
00:20:50,687 --> 00:20:54,440
- I thought you didn't want to eat.
- But you said you wanted to eat.

365
00:20:54,882 --> 00:20:58,259
<i>Since Kim Jong Kook is infamous
for his affinity for chicken breasts...</i>

366
00:20:58,602 --> 00:21:03,651
<i>and Miss Kyung Ah has to stay conscientious
about what she eats to keep her slim figure.</i>

367
00:21:03,652 --> 00:21:07,014
<i>The cooking genre for our
health conscious team is...</i>

368
00:21:07,015 --> 00:21:08,778
<i>Chicken.</i>

369
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:15,922
<i>Since you have to find yourselves a healthy
chicken to use as your main menu item...</i>

370
00:21:15,923 --> 00:21:18,496
<i>you have to go pay a visit to
the chicken doctor.</i>

371
00:21:18,497 --> 00:21:21,688
- Chicken Doctor?
- Chicken doctor? Seriously?

372
00:21:21,689 --> 00:21:24,742
There really is a chicken doctor?
That's actually a bit of a tongue twister.

373
00:21:24,743 --> 00:21:29,005
- You have to go visit the chicken doctor.
- Right now?

374
00:21:29,337 --> 00:21:31,953
- Okay. Not sure who that is, but let's go.
- Okay.

375
00:21:32,703 --> 00:21:34,664
There's a chicken doctor?

376
00:21:34,665 --> 00:21:36,617
A chicken doctor.

377
00:21:38,492 --> 00:21:41,725
<i>A chicken doctor?
I bet he'll be pretty funny.</i>

378
00:21:41,726 --> 00:21:44,210
- What if it's Mr. Lee Gae In?
- Oh!

379
00:21:44,211 --> 00:21:46,036
- Maybe you're right.
- Maybe it'll be Mr. Lee Gae In.

380
00:21:46,037 --> 00:21:49,420
[Kwang Soo and John Park's
main ingredient is, noodles.]

381
00:21:49,421 --> 00:21:51,246
Then let's go to all those three places.

382
00:21:51,247 --> 00:21:54,359
[On their way to the three most famous noodle
places in Choonchun to learn the secrets.]

383
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:56,577
What do you think about mixing the broth
from all those three famous places together?

384
00:21:58,258 --> 00:22:01,852
- Like jjamppong?
- Mix all those three tasty broths together.

385
00:22:02,141 --> 00:22:04,756
- A little bit of each broth?
- Then I bet we'll get something incredible.

386
00:22:04,757 --> 00:22:06,881
[Are you being serious right now?]

387
00:22:08,198 --> 00:22:11,711
What else do we have to do with the noodles?
How else can we make it delicious?

388
00:22:11,746 --> 00:22:16,823
I think the most important thing is how we
make and cook the noodles themselves.

389
00:22:17,509 --> 00:22:19,547
Because I think that would change
the flavor of the whole dish.

390
00:22:19,548 --> 00:22:22,907
That's a good way of putting it.
That sounded really professional.

391
00:22:22,908 --> 00:22:25,309
I think it would be best if we kept
using words like that later on.

392
00:22:26,215 --> 00:22:27,747
Flavor.

393
00:22:27,748 --> 00:22:29,690
I don't think I've heard that word being
used in real life before.

394
00:22:30,077 --> 00:22:33,487
Then I'm the Chef,
and you're the Sous Chef today?

395
00:22:34,117 --> 00:22:36,164
- What's a Sous Chef?
- Assistant Chef.

396
00:22:36,648 --> 00:22:38,938
- Which is a higher position?
- Chef.

397
00:22:41,138 --> 00:22:43,193
Shouldn't I be higher?

398
00:22:43,194 --> 00:22:45,903
But you're going to do
as I ask you to do, right?

399
00:22:45,904 --> 00:22:50,714
Rather than saying that I'm taking orders,
maybe we can say that I'll help.

400
00:22:50,715 --> 00:22:52,334
[Who will take the higher position?]

401
00:22:52,335 --> 00:22:54,069
Something more equal.

402
00:22:54,672 --> 00:22:57,214
- Then let's just be couple chefs.
- Okay, couple, it is.

403
00:22:57,215 --> 00:22:58,944
That way we'll be equal.

404
00:23:01,445 --> 00:23:03,349
[Just complete your dish...]

405
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:06,887
[Because...]

406
00:23:06,888 --> 00:23:11,401
[A battle that you haven't even fathomed
will soon be taking place.]

407
00:23:11,402 --> 00:23:15,134
[A real nerve wrecking battle.]

408
00:23:15,135 --> 00:23:21,929
[Who dares to take cooking lightly!?]

409
00:23:25,622 --> 00:23:27,964
[12 hours before the competition.]

410
00:23:30,302 --> 00:23:34,288
[The members are dispersing all over
the place to get the freshest ingredients.]

411
00:23:37,774 --> 00:23:41,606
[Harbor seafood market.]

412
00:23:41,607 --> 00:23:45,074
- Since this is an outdoor market...
- A fresh seafood market.

413
00:23:46,208 --> 00:23:48,416
Hello.
Sis!

414
00:23:48,417 --> 00:23:49,839
Is she a friend of yours?

415
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:53,626
- That's my older cousin.
- Hello.

416
00:23:53,627 --> 00:23:56,668
- Where is it?
- Over there.

417
00:23:56,669 --> 00:23:59,282
- It's nice to be in your hometown.
- Isn't it nice?

418
00:23:59,852 --> 00:24:01,948
It's so good to see you!

419
00:24:04,082 --> 00:24:09,555
[Heading into the market by
her older cousin's introduction.]

420
00:24:16,823 --> 00:24:19,721
[All of the freshest sea crabs from the sea!]

421
00:24:19,722 --> 00:24:23,121
[Seafood auction market!]

422
00:24:23,122 --> 00:24:27,218
[A place where the freshest crabs
in the country originate from!]

423
00:24:27,219 --> 00:24:30,188
[Looks like the auction
is about to take place!]

424
00:24:31,079 --> 00:24:35,320
[Fresh crabs as far as the eyes can see.]

425
00:24:35,321 --> 00:24:37,394
Look at how they're foaming at the mouths.

426
00:24:37,395 --> 00:24:39,712
Come on. You want
them to bite you or something?

427
00:24:40,449 --> 00:24:42,935
Look at how pretty their color is.

428
00:24:42,936 --> 00:24:46,340
[Not an easy thing
to see such a fresh selection.]

429
00:24:47,426 --> 00:24:51,698
[An early crab auction is well under way.]

430
00:24:54,548 --> 00:24:58,484
[A energetic auction atmosphere.]

431
00:25:01,113 --> 00:25:03,149
You know what this is, Dong Wook?

432
00:25:03,150 --> 00:25:06,076
This is when they sign
to signal what they want.

433
00:25:06,077 --> 00:25:08,494
[What are you two doing?]

434
00:25:10,558 --> 00:25:13,899
[No rest in their auctioning of the crabs!]

435
00:25:16,062 --> 00:25:19,840
[The customers' hand gestures are
starting to move at an even faster speed!]

436
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:32,901
[Fascinated by what they're seeing.]

437
00:25:33,983 --> 00:25:37,069
- Keep that up, and you'll have to buy it.
- Maybe I'll win the auction.

438
00:25:39,614 --> 00:25:41,145
<i>This is so fascinating.</i>

439
00:25:42,965 --> 00:25:46,451
We have to be smart about this.
This is a big amount.

440
00:25:46,452 --> 00:25:47,982
[Let's buy some crabs!
Ji Hyo and Dong Wook getting ready to join.]

441
00:25:47,983 --> 00:25:50,865
- You're going to buy all this?
- No, just one line of it.

442
00:25:50,866 --> 00:25:53,121
[All they need is just a few...]

443
00:25:53,122 --> 00:25:55,005
Can you show us how we need to sign?

444
00:25:55,006 --> 00:25:58,552
[Trying to learn the hand gestures.]

445
00:25:58,553 --> 00:26:02,418
Five, six, seven.
The scissors sign is seven.

446
00:26:02,419 --> 00:26:04,143
This is eight.

447
00:26:06,047 --> 00:26:07,461
They're going to start.

448
00:26:07,462 --> 00:26:09,199
[Next auction is about to start!]

449
00:26:14,937 --> 00:26:18,284
[A huge auction where 800 crabs
are being sold!]

450
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:20,973
[The auction is about to start!]

451
00:26:34,746 --> 00:26:37,068
[Having offered 5,200 won per crab
without even knowing what they're doing.]

452
00:26:37,069 --> 00:26:39,091
<i>Number 260 for 5,200 won.</i>

453
00:26:44,223 --> 00:26:47,881
[Ji Hyo inadvertently wins the auction.]

454
00:26:47,882 --> 00:26:50,779
Number 260.
Please raise your hand.

455
00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:56,754
Did he just say that you won?
How many crabs are there?

456
00:26:56,755 --> 00:26:59,972
- 800 crabs.
- What are you going to do with 800 crabs?

457
00:26:59,973 --> 00:27:02,242
[A whopping 4,160,000 won worth.]

458
00:27:02,243 --> 00:27:04,224
I just started signing.

459
00:27:04,225 --> 00:27:07,113
What are you going to do with 800 crabs?

460
00:27:07,114 --> 00:27:11,026
- I'm sorry, but we don't have the money
- We just need to buy a few crabs.

461
00:27:11,027 --> 00:27:13,249
We only need one or two crabs.

462
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:15,003
[They just need a couple to cook their dish.]

463
00:27:15,477 --> 00:27:17,849
We can't eat all these!

464
00:27:17,850 --> 00:27:20,739
- We can't eat all these.
- Thank you.

465
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:23,592
[Thankfully hands over two crabs.]

466
00:27:24,669 --> 00:27:26,549
5,200 won.

467
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:30,747
[Thus, they buy themselves two crabs.]

468
00:27:30,748 --> 00:27:33,089
The auctioneer just told me that he'll
give you guys bigger and better ones.

469
00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:36,491
This is what you need.

470
00:27:36,492 --> 00:27:40,002
[Much larger ones for the same price
as the smaller ones!]

471
00:27:40,003 --> 00:27:44,681
- Thank you.
- People in my hometown are really amazing.

472
00:27:44,682 --> 00:27:47,021
- These two huge crabs...
- Thank you.

473
00:27:49,067 --> 00:27:50,741
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

474
00:27:50,742 --> 00:27:53,579
- Make sure to win first place in the battle.
- Thank you.

475
00:27:53,861 --> 00:27:58,569
[Great crabs, great people, great spirits.]

476
00:27:59,245 --> 00:28:02,377
[Ji Hyo and Dong Wook- Fighting!]

477
00:28:02,968 --> 00:28:07,364
[Ji Hyo luckily saves herself from the danger
of getting a houseful of crabs.]

478
00:28:07,365 --> 00:28:10,380
[Meanwhile,
on the other side of the country...]

479
00:28:15,083 --> 00:28:19,260
[First head banging of 2014?]

480
00:28:20,975 --> 00:28:23,199
[Rearranging his hair back into place.]

481
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:26,375
<i>We're here in Taewan...</i>

482
00:28:29,068 --> 00:28:36,491
<i>Kyung Ho and Suk Jin are headed
to get some fresh oysters.</i>

483
00:28:36,492 --> 00:28:40,406
<i>To this wintery seaside...</i>

484
00:28:40,407 --> 00:28:44,377
<i>For all the hardworking fathers out there.</i>

485
00:28:44,378 --> 00:28:46,730
But I really am feeling pretty hopeless.

486
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:56,084
[Arrives in a peaceful seaside village.]

487
00:28:57,842 --> 00:29:00,675
- It's so peaceful here.
- So there are oysters here?

488
00:29:00,676 --> 00:29:05,408
[They came to get oysters,
but where are the oysters?]

489
00:29:07,388 --> 00:29:11,130
[Changing into clothes appropriate for them
to go in the water to get their oysters.]

490
00:29:11,131 --> 00:29:13,635
Why did we have to come all the way here for
oysters when we could've gone to the store?

491
00:29:13,636 --> 00:29:15,732
- It's much fresher here.
- What?

492
00:29:15,733 --> 00:29:19,487
Then are you saying that the people who buy
their oysters are buying not so fresh ones?

493
00:29:20,055 --> 00:29:22,662
[His frustration is bringing out his dialect.]

494
00:29:22,663 --> 00:29:24,970
I like the way you said that.

495
00:29:24,971 --> 00:29:27,824
I bet the neighbors around here
are laughing at us right now.

496
00:29:27,825 --> 00:29:30,242
They're all probably wondering
what we're doing.

497
00:29:34,513 --> 00:29:36,900
So this is what it looks like.

498
00:29:36,901 --> 00:29:40,079
Dig, pull it out, and crack it open.

499
00:29:41,205 --> 00:29:42,975
Let's go oyster hunting.

500
00:29:42,976 --> 00:29:47,412
- Let's just bite down and do what we have to.
- My rocker image is out the window today.

501
00:29:47,413 --> 00:29:52,752
[Momentarily putting his rocker image aside.]

502
00:29:53,972 --> 00:29:59,900
[Thus begins the arduous road
for our rocking homemaker.]

503
00:30:00,725 --> 00:30:05,415
<i>Remember us telling you that you have to go
get your own ingredients in this nice weather?</i>

504
00:30:05,416 --> 00:30:07,319
- You each get a bottle of this.
- What is this?

505
00:30:08,041 --> 00:30:10,026
We're going to have to get on a boat.

506
00:30:10,689 --> 00:30:13,610
[Have yourselves a bottle of
medicine to help with the motion sickness.]

507
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:17,125
What kind of a program is this?
To make us take medication?

508
00:30:20,430 --> 00:30:24,995
- I feel nervous. What's the studio thinking?
- Why did you even come on the show then?

509
00:30:24,996 --> 00:30:27,725
- I was going to start the new year right.
- Then just drink it.

510
00:30:27,726 --> 00:30:29,366
Just down it.

511
00:30:34,388 --> 00:30:36,112
This actually tastes pretty good.

512
00:30:37,368 --> 00:30:39,700
They did a good job with these
motion sickness drinks.

513
00:30:39,701 --> 00:30:41,988
Why do you keep talking so much?

514
00:30:41,989 --> 00:30:45,869
Can't I even say anything?
You've been talking all day yourself!

515
00:30:45,870 --> 00:30:47,615
Seriously.

516
00:30:47,616 --> 00:30:49,713
Can't I even talk on your show?

517
00:30:49,953 --> 00:30:52,880
Fine!
Then you do all the talking by yourself.

518
00:30:55,587 --> 00:30:58,358
<i>Have you decided
what you two are going to make?</i>

519
00:30:58,359 --> 00:31:00,436
- Look at how he's pissy again.
- What do you mean, pissy?

520
00:31:01,968 --> 00:31:05,878
- They can just edit this out.
- Edit what? How are they going to edit it?

521
00:31:05,879 --> 00:31:08,238
How can they edit it in the midst
of your talking?

522
00:31:08,749 --> 00:31:10,870
I'll just smile then.

523
00:31:11,704 --> 00:31:13,514
I'll just keep smiling, so let's go.

524
00:31:13,515 --> 00:31:17,596
- Catching fish is no joke.
- Catching fish isn't easy.

525
00:31:17,597 --> 00:31:19,814
- Is this what they're always like?
- I don't know.

526
00:31:19,815 --> 00:31:22,359
Why are they doing this on the episode
that I'm guesting in?

527
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:24,975
[With it being the first episode of 2014,
this one is tougher than usual.]

528
00:31:24,976 --> 00:31:29,015
- Hello, Sir.
- Hello. Please take good care of us.

529
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:35,587
[Off to the middle of the ocean to
catch their fresh fish!]

530
00:31:36,263 --> 00:31:38,433
I don't know what we'll be able to catch.

531
00:31:38,434 --> 00:31:41,811
The captain just said that the fish won't
open their mouths if the water's too cold.

532
00:31:41,812 --> 00:31:43,267
- Because they're cold.
- Because it's cold.

533
00:31:43,268 --> 00:31:48,687
I know that it's cold out here,
but the ocean is one season behind.

534
00:31:48,688 --> 00:31:50,281
- It's one season behind.
- Really?

535
00:31:50,282 --> 00:31:54,248
So if it's the middle of the winter for us,
then it's mid-autumn for the fish.

536
00:31:54,249 --> 00:31:57,122
- So it's late fall in the ocean.
- Then spring means the middle of the winter?

537
00:31:57,123 --> 00:31:59,301
- Spring is winter.
- No way.

538
00:32:00,377 --> 00:32:02,501
How is our spring their winter?

539
00:32:02,502 --> 00:32:04,301
[Soo Hong seems to be pretty sure
of his opinion.]

540
00:32:04,302 --> 00:32:06,119
I fell into the Han River last week.

541
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:08,875
It was really cold.
It wasn't late fall, but total winter.

542
00:32:08,876 --> 00:32:11,256
- It's the middle of winter.
- Then try falling in the water in spring.

543
00:32:11,257 --> 00:32:13,551
Then why do you go to the beach to swim
in the middle of summer?

544
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:18,155
- Shouldn't you go in the fall then?
- These days...

545
00:32:19,284 --> 00:32:21,951
- Many people do go in the spring.
- What are you talking about?

546
00:32:21,952 --> 00:32:25,221
Because it's warmer...
No, I meant you have to go in late fall.

547
00:32:25,222 --> 00:32:26,677
[Getting more and more confused.]

548
00:32:26,678 --> 00:32:28,651
Late fall would be summer water
temperatures.

549
00:32:28,652 --> 00:32:29,912
You're confusing me.

550
00:32:29,913 --> 00:32:32,682
Is the camera guy walking away because
he thinks what I'm saying is ridiculous?

551
00:32:33,328 --> 00:32:36,412
- Can you blame him?
- Why is he walking away from me?

552
00:32:36,413 --> 00:32:39,718
- He's saying the ocean is better than you.
- What are you talking about?

553
00:32:39,719 --> 00:32:41,782
[Ditzy Soo Hong with his silly ideas...]

554
00:32:41,783 --> 00:32:46,285
[Will they be able to catch
even a single fish?]

555
00:32:49,123 --> 00:32:52,239
[At the same time- Najoo.]

556
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:55,445
<i>This place feels like our past history is
still very much alive and breathing.</i>

557
00:32:55,446 --> 00:32:59,402
[Where is the place that
Gary and Jae Kyung are visiting?]

558
00:32:59,828 --> 00:33:02,781
This building was built in 1884.

559
00:33:04,656 --> 00:33:06,897
It's a really old traditional home.

560
00:33:06,898 --> 00:33:11,060
[Nampa Gotek (Old House)-
A 130 year old historical home.]

561
00:33:11,061 --> 00:33:14,050
- I feel like our teacher will be scary.
- I bet our teacher will be dressed in hanbok.

562
00:33:14,604 --> 00:33:18,689
[Will they be able to meet their teacher
who'll teach them the secret of cooking?]

563
00:33:18,690 --> 00:33:21,014
- Do you hear those birds?
- It's such a beautiful house.

564
00:33:21,015 --> 00:33:23,936
- Hello.
- Hello.

565
00:33:23,937 --> 00:33:26,880
- Hello.
- Are you our teacher?

566
00:33:26,881 --> 00:33:29,869
[Could this be their teach who'll be
teaching them the secrets of cooking today?]

567
00:33:29,870 --> 00:33:33,593
[Teacher Kang Jung Sook-
A master in traditional cooking.]

568
00:33:33,594 --> 00:33:37,756
- We are here to learn your teachings.
- Yes, I've heard.

569
00:33:37,757 --> 00:33:40,940
But I feel so bad.
I'm not sure if I'll be good enough.

570
00:33:41,868 --> 00:33:44,515
I could feel your energy
the moment I touched your hand.

571
00:33:44,516 --> 00:33:47,865
[A strong energy that was felt
the moment he touched her hand.]

572
00:33:47,866 --> 00:33:50,901
- What is Najoo famous for?
- Najoo...

573
00:33:50,902 --> 00:33:54,853
Najoo is very famous for the Asian pears.
And also, in Najoo...

574
00:33:55,452 --> 00:33:58,594
We're also well known for our meat.
We're very famous for our beef.

575
00:33:58,595 --> 00:34:00,623
- Najoo's beef bone soup.
-Yes, our beef bone soup.

576
00:34:00,624 --> 00:34:05,027
Najoo's beef is famous.
We're well known for our beef bone soup.

577
00:34:05,522 --> 00:34:10,461
We're going to use our two most famous items,
the pears and beef for our dish.

578
00:34:10,462 --> 00:34:13,044
We're going to be making 'sanjeok'.
(Korean shish kebab.)

579
00:34:13,045 --> 00:34:16,277
[Secrets of sanjeok!]

580
00:34:16,278 --> 00:34:18,882
- Go and win first place, okay?
- We have to win first place.

581
00:34:18,883 --> 00:34:21,084
- Please take good care of us.
- Yes, make sure to win first place.

582
00:34:21,454 --> 00:34:26,754
[But... what's that?]

583
00:34:27,713 --> 00:34:32,358
[A special feature of this home-
A low chimney.]

584
00:34:32,359 --> 00:34:37,419
If the chimneys are too high,
then all the smoke could bother other homes.

585
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:42,205
So our chimneys are low to the ground,
so that the smoke won't bother other homes.

586
00:34:42,206 --> 00:34:45,644
I'll live my life like those low chimneys.

587
00:34:45,645 --> 00:34:47,247
- Yes, do that.
- I vow to do it.

588
00:34:47,248 --> 00:34:50,396
I really believe that you will, Gary.

589
00:34:53,331 --> 00:34:55,237
Should we try calling Song Ji Hyo?

590
00:34:58,650 --> 00:35:01,938
- Do you like your partner for the day?
- My partner is a work of art.

591
00:35:03,094 --> 00:35:07,549
Anyone else's partner that you felt envious of
or wanted to be partnered up with?

592
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:08,970
Song Ji Hyo.

593
00:35:13,454 --> 00:35:18,050
[Tries calling Ji Hyo, whom he
wanted to be partnered up with.]

594
00:35:18,051 --> 00:35:20,544
<i>The customer you are calling
cannot be reached.</i>

595
00:35:20,545 --> 00:35:22,638
What is she doing right now?

596
00:35:23,171 --> 00:35:25,790
Did she turn her phone off because
she's paired off with a male partner?

597
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:28,473
She's crossing the line...
Oh, there she is calling me.

598
00:35:30,147 --> 00:35:31,568
Hello?

599
00:35:31,569 --> 00:35:33,198
- Kang Gary!
- Song Ji Hyo!

600
00:35:33,199 --> 00:35:35,329
- Where are you?
- Me?

601
00:35:35,330 --> 00:35:38,879
Where do you think I am, you fool?
It's Monday, so I'm inside your heart.

602
00:35:39,444 --> 00:35:42,080
[He's so crazy...]

603
00:35:42,408 --> 00:35:44,966
- Kang Gary.
- Yeah? Where are you?

604
00:35:44,967 --> 00:35:47,845
- Who's your partner?
- My partner?

605
00:35:47,846 --> 00:35:48,943
Yeah.

606
00:35:48,944 --> 00:35:52,197
Why?
Are you jealous that it might be a girl?

607
00:35:54,214 --> 00:35:57,346
Yes, I'm jealous.
So where are you, Gary?

608
00:35:57,381 --> 00:36:00,042
Me?
I'm just down in the southern parts.

609
00:36:01,432 --> 00:36:03,477
Who's your partner?

610
00:36:03,478 --> 00:36:05,322
My partner is sitting right next to me.

611
00:36:05,323 --> 00:36:07,387
- Is your partner good looking?
- Yeah.

612
00:36:07,929 --> 00:36:10,196
How could you say that so quickly
without even a moment of hesitation?

613
00:36:10,197 --> 00:36:12,485
I said he's good looking
because he really is good looking.

614
00:36:12,486 --> 00:36:14,454
- Is he an actor?
- Yeah.

615
00:36:15,033 --> 00:36:17,220
- He's an actor?
- Yeah.

616
00:36:17,984 --> 00:36:21,369
I see. Can you put
him on the phone for a minute?

617
00:36:22,516 --> 00:36:24,992
Put your partner on the phone first.

618
00:36:24,993 --> 00:36:27,427
I just have some things that
I wanted to tell your partner.

619
00:36:27,428 --> 00:36:30,164
The things you like,
and the things you don't like...

620
00:36:30,165 --> 00:36:34,134
I wanted to tell him some things about you
so that he'd know how to treat you well.

621
00:36:34,579 --> 00:36:40,229
[From your Monday partner, Kang Gary...]

622
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:44,165
- He knows me as well as you do.
- He knows you well?

623
00:36:46,124 --> 00:36:48,808
What other guy out there
knows you as well as I do?

624
00:36:49,267 --> 00:36:51,351
Why would you think that
you're the only man who knows me well?

625
00:36:51,352 --> 00:36:53,857
Did you go clubbing again last week?

626
00:36:55,057 --> 00:36:57,929
[That enemy of mine...]

627
00:36:59,538 --> 00:37:04,470
[Meanwhile, Jong Kook and Kyung Ah are headed
to Namyangju to meet their chicken doctor.]

628
00:37:04,471 --> 00:37:08,509
In all honesty though...
most chicken dishes are really good, right?

629
00:37:08,510 --> 00:37:11,375
- As long as we season it right.
- Yes.

630
00:37:11,376 --> 00:37:14,049
[Still undecided as to what
they're going to make.]

631
00:37:16,494 --> 00:37:19,472
[First meeting-
Awkwardness is still in the air.]

632
00:37:19,866 --> 00:37:22,142
[Ten minutes or so later-
Slowly starting to talk...]

633
00:37:22,142 --> 00:37:26,224
I have an older brother.
And I also have an older sister.

634
00:37:27,679 --> 00:37:34,167
[30 minutes later-
An avalanche of nonstop chatter.]

635
00:37:34,516 --> 00:37:38,974
I get the feeling that you're a lively,
and pretty easy-going person?

636
00:37:39,588 --> 00:37:43,339
[How did he ever hold himself back
from all that chatter?]

637
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:46,571
- Let's talk comfortably to each other.
- Sounds good.

638
00:37:46,572 --> 00:37:47,741
[Agreeing to speak comfortably to each other
for the sake of their victory.]

639
00:37:47,742 --> 00:37:49,199
- Then lower our speech?
- Yes.

640
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,807
Okay, I'll do that then.

641
00:37:51,790 --> 00:37:54,047
- Just don't hit me.
- What are you talking about?

642
00:37:54,048 --> 00:37:56,050
I don't ever hit girls.

643
00:37:56,463 --> 00:37:57,761
[How are you getting along with
your partner?]

644
00:37:57,762 --> 00:38:01,456
I had no idea that
Jong Kook was such a talker.

645
00:38:02,101 --> 00:38:06,058
I really had no idea.
He's built like a mountain, but...

646
00:38:06,059 --> 00:38:09,810
He just won't ever stop talking.

647
00:38:11,661 --> 00:38:15,261
- How many ideas was that? Three?
- Two.

648
00:38:15,262 --> 00:38:18,621
- That was about three ideas that I had.
- Samgetang.

649
00:38:18,622 --> 00:38:21,700
- What else... the poached chicken?
- No, that was my idea!

650
00:38:21,701 --> 00:38:27,540
[They seemed to have grown closer-
Telling each other their own ideas.]

651
00:38:27,541 --> 00:38:30,382
I think imaginative creativity
is needed when it comes to cooking.

652
00:38:30,383 --> 00:38:33,007
Have you ever seen those cooking shows?

653
00:38:33,008 --> 00:38:36,634
[Wow... this guy really does talk a lot!]

654
00:38:37,316 --> 00:38:40,270
<i>Is he your usual ideal type?</i>

655
00:38:41,053 --> 00:38:43,641
Well, if it wasn't for all his talking...

656
00:38:45,216 --> 00:38:50,339
I really tend to be attracted to manly guys,
and he seems really nice too.

657
00:38:53,113 --> 00:38:55,884
Okay, we're here.

658
00:38:55,885 --> 00:38:58,628
[Finally arrives at their destination-
Chicken doctor's home.]

659
00:38:59,201 --> 00:39:01,957
I think this is where he lives.

660
00:39:01,958 --> 00:39:08,545
[An elegant country house?
Who's the chicken doctor that lives here?]

661
00:39:08,546 --> 00:39:10,035
I bet it would be really nice
to live in a place like this.

662
00:39:10,736 --> 00:39:12,977
[Even planting his own napa cabbages
right in his front yard.]

663
00:39:12,978 --> 00:39:15,436
- I feel like it's going to be Mr. Lee Gae In.
- Really?

664
00:39:15,437 --> 00:39:17,754
[Could it be Lee Gae In,
with his infamous love for chickens?]

665
00:39:21,009 --> 00:39:22,758
- Hello.
- Hello.

666
00:39:23,151 --> 00:39:24,445
Hello.

667
00:39:24,446 --> 00:39:25,762
<i>It's you!</i>

668
00:39:26,392 --> 00:39:28,391
[That voice!]

669
00:39:28,392 --> 00:39:31,715
[Could it really be the person that
they've suspected all along?]

670
00:39:33,819 --> 00:39:37,686
- You can't drop by unannounced like this.
- It's been so long!

671
00:39:37,687 --> 00:39:40,909
It really is you!
You really are the chicken doctor!

672
00:39:41,572 --> 00:39:43,886
- I'll be right out to open the gates.
- We're coming in.

673
00:39:43,887 --> 00:39:47,447
[His unmistakable voice.]

674
00:39:49,009 --> 00:39:51,572
Unbelievable.
You knew what you were talking about.

675
00:39:51,573 --> 00:39:54,295
[Finally meeting their chicken doctor.]

676
00:39:57,099 --> 00:40:00,588
[My beloved chickens...
Chicken Doctor- Lee Gae In.]

677
00:40:01,405 --> 00:40:07,960
[In the best spot out on his yard...
there's a luxury chicken coup.]

678
00:40:08,922 --> 00:40:13,915
Our main ingredient is chicken,
and we came to meet the chicken doctor.

679
00:40:13,916 --> 00:40:15,398
[Came to meet the chicken doctor
to receive his help.]

680
00:40:15,399 --> 00:40:17,738
I don't think the chickens
will like seeing you.

681
00:40:17,739 --> 00:40:19,971
- Because you're the chicken breast killer.
- I know.

682
00:40:19,972 --> 00:40:23,341
[The chicken breast killer is here!]

683
00:40:23,342 --> 00:40:24,560
Yes, I know.

684
00:40:24,561 --> 00:40:28,623
If I were to ever go to hell,
I'd be surrounded by breastless chickens.

685
00:40:28,624 --> 00:40:32,463
- Those chickens would be waiting for me.
- Look at how nervous my chickens are.

686
00:40:32,464 --> 00:40:35,854
[Jong Kook is here.
Let's hide!]

687
00:40:35,855 --> 00:40:38,256
We have a cooking battle at
seven o'clock.

688
00:40:38,257 --> 00:40:41,135
- Our main ingredient is chicken.
- Chicken.

689
00:40:41,136 --> 00:40:44,801
We have to get a really nice chicken.

690
00:40:44,802 --> 00:40:48,369
It's difficult to get a chicken like this
around here.

691
00:40:48,370 --> 00:40:51,611
I bet you'll be shocked at
the quality of my chickens.

692
00:40:51,612 --> 00:40:55,447
- We've never had this type of chicken.
- If Yoo Jae Suk tried my chicken...

693
00:40:55,448 --> 00:40:58,367
I bet he'll think that
you brought back an eagle.

694
00:40:58,368 --> 00:41:02,183
- Ingredient is what makes it.
- That's the most crucial part.

695
00:41:02,184 --> 00:41:04,607
[Good ingredients are what make
the best dishes!]

696
00:41:04,608 --> 00:41:08,009
Huge drumsticks where the meat
just falls off the bones.

697
00:41:08,010 --> 00:41:11,044
Since you two are here...

698
00:41:11,045 --> 00:41:13,759
I normally don't brag about my chickens,
but wait here a minute.

699
00:41:16,086 --> 00:41:22,647
In case of a moment like this,
I've prepared a picture album of my chickens.

700
00:41:22,648 --> 00:41:24,106
[Chicken photo album?]

701
00:41:27,091 --> 00:41:32,171
[Must've been in a rush
to show off his chickens.]

702
00:41:33,089 --> 00:41:35,695
- You should be more careful.
- We should get a hen.

703
00:41:35,696 --> 00:41:38,270
[Kyung Ah wants a mature hen?]

704
00:41:38,271 --> 00:41:42,883
[The meat on the hens are supposed to be
more tender than that of a rooster.]

705
00:41:42,884 --> 00:41:45,601
[Even though he said he didn't want to brag,
the chicken doctor brings out some pictures.]

706
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:51,607
[Showing off some
of his best looking chickens.]

707
00:41:53,046 --> 00:41:55,390
You took some really good pictures.

708
00:41:55,836 --> 00:41:58,683
- You really must love chickens.
- I didn't take these pictures.

709
00:41:59,015 --> 00:42:00,959
I had a photographer come out
to take these pictures.

710
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:06,215
- I had them professionally taken.
- Why did you have these pictures taken?

711
00:42:06,216 --> 00:42:08,235
What's the reason for these pictures?

712
00:42:08,682 --> 00:42:10,380
I'll be honest with you.

713
00:42:11,444 --> 00:42:15,702
I'm not sure about these chicks,
but we already ate these guys.

714
00:42:19,205 --> 00:42:21,055
So you took the pictures as a memory?

715
00:42:21,056 --> 00:42:22,783
[As a way to thank the chickens for
their sacrifice?]

716
00:42:22,784 --> 00:42:24,824
- You know who ate this one?
- Who?

717
00:42:24,825 --> 00:42:26,033
Tae Jin Ah.

718
00:42:27,752 --> 00:42:30,388
Mr. Tae Jin Ah ate this one?

719
00:42:30,959 --> 00:42:34,558
I've got them all.
Ones that Dok Go Young and Jo Hyung Ki ate.

720
00:42:36,965 --> 00:42:39,802
Pick the one that you want to eat.

721
00:42:39,803 --> 00:42:42,874
- You can each pick the one you want.
- I want a girl one.

722
00:42:42,875 --> 00:42:44,919
So just pick whichever one you want.

723
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:47,824
It's their fate on the line.
You have to be careful when you come in.

724
00:42:47,825 --> 00:42:51,485
[Which chickens will they choose to be
the ingredient for their dish?]

725
00:42:51,486 --> 00:42:53,199
You have to walk in slowly.

726
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:56,943
[Carefully walks into the chicken coop.]

727
00:42:56,944 --> 00:42:59,322
- This is where they sleep.
- It's a nice setup.

728
00:43:02,508 --> 00:43:05,690
[Must remain gentle and quiet
to get the ones that they want.]

729
00:43:05,691 --> 00:43:08,430
So you want that one and the white one?
Okay, go wait outside.

730
00:43:11,322 --> 00:43:15,752
[They're about to get their chickens
from the chicken doctor.]

731
00:43:15,753 --> 00:43:19,571
I was going to choose something a bit bigger
than the white one.

732
00:43:23,825 --> 00:43:28,915
[Which one should he get...]

733
00:43:34,577 --> 00:43:39,167
[You guys look so much prettier
than any other day...]

734
00:43:39,168 --> 00:43:41,241
Ah... I don't know what to do.

735
00:43:43,117 --> 00:43:46,092
[Huh? He's coming back out empty handed?]

736
00:43:49,428 --> 00:43:51,868
- You don't want to let them go?
- No, it's not that.

737
00:43:52,661 --> 00:43:54,321
- But...
- Yes?

738
00:43:55,186 --> 00:43:57,122
- Let's do it like this.
- How?

739
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:02,192
- It's not that I don't want to give it away.
- Be honest with us.

740
00:44:02,193 --> 00:44:03,722
- I'm going to give it to you.
- Okay, so what is it?

741
00:44:05,364 --> 00:44:09,986
I have other chickens just like them.
They have cousins.

742
00:44:09,987 --> 00:44:12,128
[Their cousins are nearby?]

743
00:44:12,129 --> 00:44:16,326
I have others that I grow in the wild,
so they taste even better.

744
00:44:16,327 --> 00:44:20,806
Because they've had a better diet,
so they taste even better.

745
00:44:20,807 --> 00:44:23,239
I'm just thinking of you guys.

746
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:29,517
- So I'll call them to give you two chickens.
- You just said you're going to give it to us.

747
00:44:29,518 --> 00:44:32,232
[But he just said that he was going to
give them two of his...]

748
00:44:32,233 --> 00:44:34,320
Then why did you even show us
your pictures?

749
00:44:34,321 --> 00:44:40,594
I just wanted to show you how they've
been raised here in my house.

750
00:44:40,595 --> 00:44:42,534
Why did you make us think that
you were going to give us yours?

751
00:44:42,535 --> 00:44:45,145
In exchange...
for having come to my house...

752
00:44:45,146 --> 00:44:47,100
- I'll give you some eggs.
- You're giving us some eggs?

753
00:44:47,101 --> 00:44:50,324
[Giving away some of his eggs as a gift
for coming out to his house.]

754
00:44:50,325 --> 00:44:53,352
[Much larger and better
even at a quick glance.]

755
00:44:53,353 --> 00:44:55,783
- They're different.
- Look at these colors.

756
00:44:55,784 --> 00:44:58,900
[Eggs instead of chickens.]

757
00:44:59,464 --> 00:45:02,986
- I bet these will be good enough.
- You can boil these.

758
00:45:02,987 --> 00:45:05,425
I'll give you a head of cabbage too.

759
00:45:05,426 --> 00:45:07,112
[Winter cabbage as a bonus!]

760
00:45:07,113 --> 00:45:09,285
Pulling the cabbage out of frozen ground
isn't an easy thing to do though, is it?

761
00:45:09,286 --> 00:45:10,922
[Winter cabbage!]

762
00:45:10,923 --> 00:45:15,328
You can pull these leaves off,
and make soup with it.

763
00:45:16,165 --> 00:45:18,491
They're still fresh on the inside.

764
00:45:18,492 --> 00:45:22,389
[Kyung Ah seems to know
what she's doing.]

765
00:45:23,414 --> 00:45:25,454
You're good at that.

766
00:45:26,623 --> 00:45:29,178
Not bad.

767
00:45:29,179 --> 00:45:31,905
- This is really nice.
- Can we take some scallions too?

768
00:45:31,906 --> 00:45:34,260
Sure, take some scallions with you.

769
00:45:34,261 --> 00:45:37,732
[Kyung Ah showing talent for spotting
the ingredients needed for their dish?]

770
00:45:39,524 --> 00:45:41,634
If you're going to pull some out,
then pull out the whole bunch.

771
00:45:43,569 --> 00:45:46,404
[A whole bunch of fresh winter scallions!]

772
00:45:48,102 --> 00:45:53,836
Winter scallions grown outside like this
are much tastier than greenhouse scallions.

773
00:45:55,353 --> 00:45:58,522
- That's why I have these out here.
- Kyung Ah has an eye for spotting these.

774
00:45:59,049 --> 00:46:01,333
I didn't even think to take these.

775
00:46:01,334 --> 00:46:05,179
- I didn't think of it either.
- Thank you.

776
00:46:05,180 --> 00:46:07,869
[Song Kyung Ah is a good partner to have.]

777
00:46:08,053 --> 00:46:10,688
It's now 2014.

778
00:46:10,689 --> 00:46:14,813
The first weekend of the new year...

779
00:46:14,814 --> 00:46:17,676
If someone were to cook you dinner,
what would you like to have?

780
00:46:17,677 --> 00:46:20,022
- What would you like to eat?
- Chicken soup with clear broth.

781
00:46:20,023 --> 00:46:22,324
The kind of soup with whole pieces of
bone-in chicken.

782
00:46:22,325 --> 00:46:29,336
[A bowl of hearty chicken soup that can be
shared with the entire family.]

783
00:46:29,337 --> 00:46:30,660
Okay, I understand.

784
00:46:33,213 --> 00:46:36,647
[Gae In wants them to win since he had
some help getting them the ingredients.]

785
00:46:37,490 --> 00:46:39,774
Thank you so much.

786
00:46:39,775 --> 00:46:42,763
[Thank you to Mr. Lee Gae In for your
enthusiastic help.]

787
00:46:46,950 --> 00:46:48,467
Let's go!

788
00:46:50,936 --> 00:46:53,236
Are they all oysters?
I think these are oysters.

789
00:46:53,237 --> 00:46:55,460
[These are all oysters?]

790
00:46:55,461 --> 00:46:58,385
[It's a field of oysters!]

791
00:46:58,386 --> 00:47:01,272
How can these all be oysters?
Look, someone is picking oysters.

792
00:47:01,273 --> 00:47:03,649
- Are these all oysters?
- Hello.

793
00:47:03,650 --> 00:47:07,068
- These are all oysters?
- It's an oyster field.

794
00:47:09,650 --> 00:47:12,990
[The two men are now walking
on top of an oyster carpet.]

795
00:47:12,991 --> 00:47:15,100
I can't believe this is all oysters.

796
00:47:15,101 --> 00:47:17,598
- Hello.
- It's nice to meet you.

797
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:20,092
- Mr. Big-nose!
- Yes, hello.

798
00:47:20,093 --> 00:47:23,275
[Familiar with her Running Man characters.]

799
00:47:23,276 --> 00:47:26,107
- These are all oysters?
- Yes, they're all oysters.

800
00:47:26,108 --> 00:47:28,952
- Then we can just pick them?
- You can't just pick any one of them.

801
00:47:28,953 --> 00:47:32,006
You have to make sure to pick
the big ones.

802
00:47:32,007 --> 00:47:34,482
- I want to see what the meat looks like.
- The meat?

803
00:47:34,483 --> 00:47:36,470
Can you crack one open for us?
How do you do it?

804
00:47:36,716 --> 00:47:40,756
[Seeing the expert at work.]

805
00:47:40,757 --> 00:47:43,618
Stick it on the side and crack it?

806
00:47:43,619 --> 00:47:47,056
- Open it up like this.
- Wow, look at that meat!

807
00:47:48,441 --> 00:47:51,036
[Fresh oyster!]

808
00:47:54,363 --> 00:47:57,005
You can't get it fresher than that.
How is it?

809
00:47:57,006 --> 00:47:59,535
It tastes totally different than the ones
that you get from the market.

810
00:48:00,671 --> 00:48:04,000
- Is it sweet?
- It melts in your mouth.

811
00:48:05,794 --> 00:48:09,166
- The aftertaste is so sweet.
- I want to try one too.

812
00:48:10,046 --> 00:48:12,468
- I think we need to start.
- Let's start picking our oysters.

813
00:48:12,469 --> 00:48:16,644
Let's pick the freshest oysters here,
and make the ultimate oyster dish.

814
00:48:16,645 --> 00:48:18,655
[Perfect ingredient for a
strength inducing dish.]

815
00:48:18,656 --> 00:48:22,621
[Nature's perfect
nutrition packed food- Oysters.]

816
00:48:28,897 --> 00:48:32,800
[Fresh oyster even
the crabs can't seem to resist.]

817
00:48:32,801 --> 00:48:34,864
Where are the eyes?

818
00:48:38,416 --> 00:48:42,763
[Pounding away for the past several minutes.]

819
00:48:45,192 --> 00:48:48,526
- Why are you so bad at that?
- Give me a minute.

820
00:48:49,312 --> 00:48:52,708
[The rocker seems to be struggling
with his oyster.]

821
00:49:01,398 --> 00:49:04,850
I'm so annoyed!

822
00:49:04,851 --> 00:49:06,441
[Explodes in seventh octave.]

823
00:49:08,787 --> 00:49:10,718
I'm really bad at things like this too.

824
00:49:10,719 --> 00:49:13,196
But you're even worse than me.

825
00:49:16,326 --> 00:49:18,558
Can you turn that camera off for now?

826
00:49:21,790 --> 00:49:24,128
Start filming again when I get
better at cracking these.

827
00:49:27,486 --> 00:49:30,820
[Rocker's sense of pride is crumbling in
front of the hard shelled oysters.]

828
00:49:31,958 --> 00:49:34,005
You look so modest right now.

829
00:49:34,006 --> 00:49:35,869
- Who?
- You.

830
00:49:35,870 --> 00:49:41,855
- Your stance looks so modest.
- I may sing rock, but my life is a ballad.

831
00:49:41,856 --> 00:49:46,417
Your life is like a smooth ballad.
Look at how modest you look right now.

832
00:49:46,418 --> 00:49:49,287
I'm going to hear about
how I look like a woman now.

833
00:49:52,873 --> 00:49:58,591
[They thought all they would have to do is
pick up some oysters from the ground...]

834
00:49:58,592 --> 00:50:03,507
[But wow, is this ever hard...]

835
00:50:07,772 --> 00:50:09,828
What kind of meat do you want to get?

836
00:50:09,829 --> 00:50:11,699
- What kind of meat do you want?
- Me?

837
00:50:11,734 --> 00:50:13,338
- Yeah.
- I want a roasted tenderloin.

838
00:50:13,339 --> 00:50:18,372
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about the fish meat.

839
00:50:18,373 --> 00:50:21,669
[Handed a bucket of little fish
to use as their bait.]

840
00:50:23,188 --> 00:50:25,320
You're acting like a kid.

841
00:50:25,321 --> 00:50:27,550
[Little Hyuk with a lot of fears.]

842
00:50:28,332 --> 00:50:31,080
I'm worried about catching the fish too.
I normally can't touch fish.

843
00:50:31,544 --> 00:50:33,906
- Have you ever been fishing before?
- We need to catch some fish.

844
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:38,411
I don't think I can do it.

845
00:50:38,412 --> 00:50:40,264
- I'm scared.
- Watch how I do it.

846
00:50:40,265 --> 00:50:44,347
- If you can't even do this...
- Do we just hook it?

847
00:50:47,933 --> 00:50:49,902
I'm too scared and I don't think I can do it.

848
00:50:50,847 --> 00:50:53,839
Jae Suk is very squeamish.

849
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:56,201
He used to cry all the time,
and was known for being a crybaby.

850
00:50:56,202 --> 00:50:58,902
We met when you were 19, right?
Right after school?

851
00:50:58,903 --> 00:51:01,485
- Yeah, we did.
- You were such a snot nosed kid.

852
00:51:01,486 --> 00:51:04,320
- I showed you around the station.
- You said I was a snot nosed kid?

853
00:51:05,918 --> 00:51:09,607
You must have really big ears
to be able to hear what I said.

854
00:51:12,726 --> 00:51:14,907
- I should be able to feel it.
- Yes, I feel something.

855
00:51:14,908 --> 00:51:17,864
- Then you just bob it in the water.
- Like this?

856
00:51:17,865 --> 00:51:20,218
Just bob it along like that.

857
00:51:20,219 --> 00:51:22,295
I don't know if the fish
are even going to bite.

858
00:51:22,296 --> 00:51:25,650
- It would be nice if we caught one.
- We have to catch something.

859
00:51:26,078 --> 00:51:29,636
[Will they be able to catch their fish?]

860
00:51:30,992 --> 00:51:33,969
[Ten seconds later.]

861
00:51:33,970 --> 00:51:36,592
[20 seconds later.]

862
00:51:36,593 --> 00:51:39,403
[30 seconds later.]

863
00:51:39,404 --> 00:51:43,287
[Quiet...]

864
00:51:45,351 --> 00:51:47,162
I don't think we're going to
catch anything.

865
00:51:47,163 --> 00:51:49,376
I haven't gotten any bites.

866
00:51:49,377 --> 00:51:50,662
[Already ready to give up
in less than a minute.]

867
00:51:50,663 --> 00:51:56,766
You're being ridiculous right now.
Fishing could take hours.

868
00:51:56,767 --> 00:52:00,048
It takes a while to get a bite.
It doesn't start right away.

869
00:52:01,135 --> 00:52:03,260
I don't think I'm suited for fishing.

870
00:52:03,261 --> 00:52:05,265
It's because you're trying to catch
the fish with your talking.

871
00:52:05,266 --> 00:52:10,055
I hate boring things like this.
I hate having to wait around.

872
00:52:10,056 --> 00:52:12,647
I'm not good at waiting around like this.

873
00:52:13,725 --> 00:52:15,957
There's absolutely nothing out here.

874
00:52:17,871 --> 00:52:22,129
[Starts to fish even with his chatty
little brother standing next to him.]

875
00:52:22,130 --> 00:52:24,427
You have to feel for it.

876
00:52:25,373 --> 00:52:30,322
[You must learn to be patient...]

877
00:52:32,008 --> 00:52:33,499
See?
My line is moving.

878
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:35,806
- What's moving?
- My line is moving.

879
00:52:39,376 --> 00:52:41,918
[Oh? Maybe he's caught something?]

880
00:52:42,550 --> 00:52:44,957
[Did he already catch something?]

881
00:52:44,958 --> 00:52:46,952
I'm telling you that my line moved.

882
00:52:48,687 --> 00:52:50,908
[Huh?]

883
00:52:50,909 --> 00:52:52,977
Your line is caught in my line.

884
00:52:54,649 --> 00:52:57,511
[The two fishing lines
are tangled up together.]

885
00:52:57,512 --> 00:53:00,345
I can't believe that happened.
Hang on a minute.

886
00:53:01,371 --> 00:53:03,202
I think we need to be further apart.
Go over that way.

887
00:53:06,317 --> 00:53:08,950
[Sending Jae Suk away from him to prevent
the lines from tangling again.]

888
00:53:12,267 --> 00:53:14,109
I think I've got something.

889
00:53:19,013 --> 00:53:20,615
- Did you get something?
- Yeah.

890
00:53:22,420 --> 00:53:24,907
[Huh?]

891
00:53:24,908 --> 00:53:28,569
[He caught himself some seaweed.]

892
00:53:28,570 --> 00:53:30,380
You caught a big piece of seaweed.

893
00:53:33,702 --> 00:53:35,710
I don't know about fishing.

894
00:53:36,408 --> 00:53:38,606
Let's just catch one.
Just one.

895
00:53:38,607 --> 00:53:41,894
Remember when Duk Hwa was
on the show?

896
00:53:41,895 --> 00:53:44,296
We went out fishing,
and we didn't catch a single one.

897
00:53:44,732 --> 00:53:47,464
Please take care of me, my bait.

898
00:53:52,777 --> 00:53:54,575
Oh! I got something!

899
00:53:55,389 --> 00:53:56,828
I got something!

900
00:53:56,829 --> 00:53:59,670
[It seems as though he really
did get himself something this time?]

901
00:54:00,003 --> 00:54:02,681
- Jae Suk!
- Really?

902
00:54:03,417 --> 00:54:06,601
[What did he get?]

903
00:54:09,065 --> 00:54:11,838
[Wow! He caught something!]

904
00:54:19,037 --> 00:54:22,026
[It's a rockfish!]

905
00:54:24,741 --> 00:54:26,315
I can't believe it!

906
00:54:30,111 --> 00:54:32,011
I can't believe it!

907
00:54:33,410 --> 00:54:35,674
We caught one!
I can't believe it!

908
00:54:38,662 --> 00:54:42,497
Unhook the fish.
There's definitely fish in the water.

909
00:54:42,498 --> 00:54:44,290
[Who knew they'd catch one so quickly?]

910
00:54:44,818 --> 00:54:46,885
[You must be more talented than him?]

911
00:54:47,832 --> 00:54:50,590
[Feeling uplifted right away.]

912
00:54:50,591 --> 00:54:52,723
This can't be done if you're nothing
but a chatterbox.

913
00:54:54,053 --> 00:54:55,785
You're good at this.

914
00:54:55,786 --> 00:54:57,717
I'm sorry, little fish.

915
00:54:57,718 --> 00:55:00,226
[Feeling grateful and sorry to the fish
at the same time.]

916
00:55:00,227 --> 00:55:02,891
I feel really bad for the fish.

917
00:55:05,272 --> 00:55:08,856
[Fresh rockfish's bodily protest.]

918
00:55:09,707 --> 00:55:11,855
That's great.

919
00:55:11,856 --> 00:55:14,056
I'm telling you that this is my year.

920
00:55:15,061 --> 00:55:20,542
This really is the year for me.
Look at how big it is. It's as big as my face.

921
00:55:22,476 --> 00:55:27,582
At last... Our dear viewers.
At last, by catching this rockfish

922
00:55:27,583 --> 00:55:30,520
I think we'll be able to participate
in the rest of this episode as well.

923
00:55:30,521 --> 00:55:34,161
- We've now caught our rockfish.
- I caught the fish!

924
00:55:34,162 --> 00:55:36,982
I bet that will be amazing
when we cook it.

925
00:55:36,983 --> 00:55:40,013
I'm even shocked at myself.

926
00:55:40,014 --> 00:55:42,858
- That was really great.
- You know what we should do?

927
00:55:42,859 --> 00:55:46,180
When you start to feel the line dip,
you need to wait a minute.

928
00:55:46,181 --> 00:55:48,505
- Sop bobbing the line when you feel that.
- Okay.

929
00:55:48,506 --> 00:55:52,890
- You have to stop bobbing then.
- Look at you acting like you're all cool.

930
00:55:53,724 --> 00:55:57,078
What are you talking about?
I'm not acting like I'm cool.

931
00:55:57,079 --> 00:55:58,875
[Back to bickering once again.]

932
00:55:59,306 --> 00:56:02,659
We just started fishing.
You are so unlucky, little fish.

933
00:56:02,660 --> 00:56:05,512
To be caught by Soo Hong of all people.

934
00:56:06,848 --> 00:56:09,301
I'm going to dip my line right here.
This is the spot.

935
00:56:09,302 --> 00:56:12,845
[A fierce fishing competition.]

936
00:56:14,296 --> 00:56:16,769
I think I've got the feel for it now.

937
00:56:17,592 --> 00:56:19,871
Please let me just catch one.

938
00:56:19,872 --> 00:56:22,111
[Let me just catch one fish...]

939
00:56:22,664 --> 00:56:24,838
Even Soo Hong's caught one.
Please let me catch one too.

940
00:56:24,839 --> 00:56:26,966
[Unable to stand seeing his friend
catch one when he hasn't been able to.]

941
00:56:26,967 --> 00:56:29,252
I wish I could catch a tuna or something.

942
00:56:29,253 --> 00:56:30,962
You want to go fishing for tuna?

943
00:56:33,437 --> 00:56:35,029
You got something!

944
00:56:35,328 --> 00:56:38,203
[Did Jae Suk get something?]

945
00:56:43,660 --> 00:56:45,811
Turn it!

946
00:56:49,468 --> 00:56:52,126
[The fishing rod is bent almost halfway!]

947
00:56:53,178 --> 00:56:55,337
[Is it... really a tuna?]

948
00:56:55,338 --> 00:56:58,341
It's way too big!
You have to keep turning it!

949
00:56:58,342 --> 00:57:00,681
[Just what could it be?]

950
00:57:10,092 --> 00:57:13,447
[Are Dong Wook and Ji Hyo fishing too?]

951
00:57:14,538 --> 00:57:16,758
I caught one!
I've got one!

952
00:57:16,759 --> 00:57:18,078
[She really did catch it.]

953
00:57:18,878 --> 00:57:21,758
- It got one!
- Don't come this way!

954
00:57:21,759 --> 00:57:23,113
[It's a squid!]

955
00:57:28,773 --> 00:57:31,415
[The squid shoots water at Dong Wook.]

956
00:57:33,795 --> 00:57:36,899
I got it.

957
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:38,814
- I caught one.
- Let's eat it.

958
00:57:39,989 --> 00:57:42,619
- I caught it.
- Are you going to cook another dish?

959
00:57:43,708 --> 00:57:45,769
No, I'm just going to eat it.

960
00:57:47,119 --> 00:57:50,047
- I'm going to eat it as sushi.
- We're making sushi out of it.

961
00:57:53,095 --> 00:57:55,984
That's where I grew up.

962
00:57:55,985 --> 00:57:57,563
Where?

963
00:57:57,564 --> 00:58:02,801
[Seaside village where Blank Ji grew up.]

964
00:58:02,802 --> 00:58:06,947
[Fresh sushi with the squid
that she just caught herself.]

965
00:58:06,948 --> 00:58:08,893
It's good to just eat it by itself too.

966
00:58:10,210 --> 00:58:11,910
Try it just by itself.

967
00:58:14,871 --> 00:58:17,334
- Isn't it sweet just on its own?
- Yeah, it's really fresh.

968
00:58:17,335 --> 00:58:20,193
[The sweetness of fresh squid.]

969
00:58:20,194 --> 00:58:22,646
Can't we have some soju with this?

970
00:58:22,647 --> 00:58:23,841
[Huh? Alcohol?]

971
00:58:23,842 --> 00:58:26,915
[Did he bring something?]

972
00:58:28,618 --> 00:58:31,105
- I don't have anything.
- You had me fooled for a second.

973
00:58:35,914 --> 00:58:42,791
[A place where the fresh sushi,
and sounds of the ocean go hand in hand.]

974
00:58:42,792 --> 00:58:44,493
Squid sushi, and my partner.

975
00:58:44,494 --> 00:58:46,876
[Tastes even better to eat it
with a friend.]

976
00:58:53,922 --> 00:58:58,474
[Arrives at the destination that
Mr. Lee Gae In told them about.]

977
00:58:58,475 --> 00:58:59,945
- Hello.
- Hello, Sir.

978
00:59:00,430 --> 00:59:02,286
- Hello.
- Hello.

979
00:59:02,287 --> 00:59:06,585
- Do you know Mr. Lee Gae In?
- Yes, I know him very well.

980
00:59:06,586 --> 00:59:09,331
He told us to come here.

981
00:59:09,332 --> 00:59:12,007
[It's a place that Lee Gae In himself
frequents often.]

982
00:59:12,481 --> 00:59:15,787
All these guys...

983
00:59:15,788 --> 00:59:19,135
I don't think we should talk too loudly.
We need one for us to make our dish.

984
00:59:21,639 --> 00:59:23,887
[Frightened Mr. Capable.]

985
00:59:24,367 --> 00:59:26,832
[Fearless Kyung Ah starts chasing
the chickens around.]

986
00:59:26,833 --> 00:59:28,128
[Who is that girl?]

987
00:59:29,197 --> 00:59:31,235
They're all gathered over there.
They're trapped.

988
00:59:31,236 --> 00:59:32,850
They're trapped.

989
00:59:32,851 --> 00:59:34,761
It hit me!

990
00:59:34,762 --> 00:59:37,338
- It hit me! What do I do?
- Catch it!

991
00:59:40,244 --> 00:59:42,424
You're too good at that.

992
00:59:44,939 --> 00:59:47,909
Don't you think that you're too good?
Go catch another one.

993
00:59:48,194 --> 00:59:50,701
Is your mouth the only thing
you brought here?

994
00:59:50,702 --> 00:59:53,819
What are you doing?
You're nothing like how you are on TV.

995
00:59:53,820 --> 00:59:57,064
- I just want to watch you catch another one.
- What are you doing?

996
00:59:57,065 --> 01:00:00,074
Go catch one.
I'm going to stay here and play with this one.

997
01:00:01,270 --> 01:00:04,001
I have to look around to see
which one would be best for us.

998
01:00:04,002 --> 01:00:06,082
- That one.
- Which one? This one?

999
01:00:19,396 --> 01:00:21,786
You're a good catcher too.

1000
01:00:21,787 --> 01:00:23,764
- You're a man, after all.
- That wasn't so bad.

1001
01:00:25,651 --> 01:00:30,183
There's something innocent
about Jong Kook.

1002
01:00:30,184 --> 01:00:32,247
He's pretty easy to order around.

1003
01:00:34,671 --> 01:00:37,977
You just work him right,
and then he's off to do your bidding.

1004
01:00:37,978 --> 01:00:40,350
Then he's off running to do your bidding.

1005
01:00:40,351 --> 01:00:45,653
[Meanwhile, out in the ocean...]

1006
01:00:45,654 --> 01:00:48,918
[An unbelievable force!]

1007
01:00:49,829 --> 01:00:52,515
[Their voices are rising at
the excitement and the thrill.]

1008
01:00:52,516 --> 01:00:55,821
[Just what could be at the other end
of the fishing line?]

1009
01:00:58,010 --> 01:01:00,145
You have to be careful,
or the line is going to snap.

1010
01:01:04,815 --> 01:01:06,115
You can't keep pulling like that.

1011
01:01:06,116 --> 01:01:08,700
I bet it's caught on the ocean floor.

1012
01:01:10,033 --> 01:01:13,787
[It's caught... on the ocean floor?]

1013
01:01:15,401 --> 01:01:18,720
[Ah... so that's why it was so bent over.]

1014
01:01:21,127 --> 01:01:22,730
It's caught on the ground.

1015
01:01:22,731 --> 01:01:25,093
We were all excited over nothing.

1016
01:01:25,703 --> 01:01:27,365
This is a little embarrassing.

1017
01:01:28,753 --> 01:01:32,036
[The embarrassingly empty fishing line.]

1018
01:01:32,037 --> 01:01:34,396
This is really embarrassing.

1019
01:01:34,397 --> 01:01:37,259
[Unsure of what to do with themselves
from the embarrassment of their reactions.]

1020
01:01:38,461 --> 01:01:40,741
It's just that your fishing rod
was so far bent over.

1021
01:01:40,742 --> 01:01:43,864
- I didn't know what you had.
- I thought that I got a tuna or something.

1022
01:01:43,865 --> 01:01:46,634
I thought that you were going to get
a whale or something.

1023
01:01:46,635 --> 01:01:49,515
I got excited when you started
getting so excited.

1024
01:01:49,516 --> 01:01:51,097
[Both are embarrassed from
the overreaction.]

1025
01:01:51,098 --> 01:01:53,372
I didn't overreact that much.

1026
01:01:53,373 --> 01:01:56,731
- I thought it was going to be something.
- I thought I had gotten something huge.

1027
01:01:57,334 --> 01:01:59,867
I was shocked at how bent
that fishing rod was.

1028
01:01:59,868 --> 01:02:02,203
So this is why people like to fish.

1029
01:02:03,740 --> 01:02:06,638
- But we didn't get anything for it.
- It was caught on the floor of the ocean.

1030
01:02:06,639 --> 01:02:09,576
- I thought I was going to catch a shark.
- I can't believe that was for nothing.

1031
01:02:11,305 --> 01:02:13,374
You want me to hook it for you?
You think you can do it yourself?

1032
01:02:13,375 --> 01:02:14,849
I don't think I can hook it.

1033
01:02:15,848 --> 01:02:19,118
[Pissy older brother coming over to help
Jae Suk hook his bait again.]

1034
01:02:20,354 --> 01:02:22,398
You're really good at doing
things like that.

1035
01:02:22,399 --> 01:02:24,487
- You have to do things this when you cook.
- You really are a man.

1036
01:02:24,488 --> 01:02:26,683
[Soo Hong has many hidden talents
that we weren't aware of.]

1037
01:02:26,994 --> 01:02:28,552
You've got something.

1038
01:02:28,568 --> 01:02:31,798
[I've got a bite?]

1039
01:02:31,799 --> 01:02:32,888
Really?

1040
01:02:32,923 --> 01:02:35,452
[Soo Hong's line again?]

1041
01:02:36,708 --> 01:02:40,189
[Could it be?]

1042
01:02:43,775 --> 01:02:47,036
[Another fish!]

1043
01:02:47,037 --> 01:02:50,969
Jae Suk!
Jae Suk, I did it again!

1044
01:02:55,111 --> 01:02:57,694
- It's huge! Look at the size!
- Look at how happy our captain is.

1045
01:02:57,695 --> 01:03:00,109
[Even the captain seems to be happy.]

1046
01:03:01,230 --> 01:03:04,390
It's a total riot over here, everyone!

1047
01:03:05,369 --> 01:03:08,283
Jae Suk!
We're going to have a feast!

1048
01:03:08,284 --> 01:03:12,044
- This must be his year!
- This really is going to be my year!

1049
01:03:12,045 --> 01:03:14,188
- Look at that.
- This really is a big one.

1050
01:03:16,119 --> 01:03:18,138
I want to know what that feels like too.

1051
01:03:20,647 --> 01:03:21,917
- Jae Suk.
- Yeah?

1052
01:03:21,918 --> 01:03:24,086
- Try over here.
- Where?

1053
01:03:24,087 --> 01:03:28,024
In that bucket.
You said you wanted to know what it's like.

1054
01:03:28,025 --> 01:03:29,749
[That's where he's told to fish?]

1055
01:03:29,750 --> 01:03:34,604
Why don't you try saying something?
You were so excited earlier.

1056
01:03:35,008 --> 01:03:38,363
What are we supposed to do when you remain
so quiet during the filming of the show?

1057
01:03:38,364 --> 01:03:40,657
I vow to catch something.

1058
01:03:40,658 --> 01:03:45,238
I'm not going to live it down if I don't
catch something right now.

1059
01:03:45,239 --> 01:03:47,516
Tell everyone that
you went home empty handed.

1060
01:03:48,115 --> 01:03:51,483
- Why do you think you haven't caught any?
- Seriously!

1061
01:03:52,297 --> 01:03:55,028
I'm just telling you to host the show.
You love talking during the show.

1062
01:03:55,802 --> 01:04:00,061
'I don't think I'm made for this.
I'll just make my living with talking'.

1063
01:04:00,529 --> 01:04:02,240
'I vow to everyone'.

1064
01:04:02,241 --> 01:04:04,467
- 'My dear audience...'.
- Please.

1065
01:04:04,927 --> 01:04:07,401
Please let me just catch one.

1066
01:04:07,402 --> 01:04:10,743
[Desperately praying to just catch one.]

1067
01:04:13,314 --> 01:04:15,199
I have to catch one.

1068
01:04:16,337 --> 01:04:19,669
[Camera staff]
- I caught two.

1069
01:04:26,763 --> 01:04:28,764
No way.
I couldn't have caught another one!

1070
01:04:28,765 --> 01:04:31,177
Then I would feel so bad for Jae Suk.

1071
01:04:32,203 --> 01:04:34,071
What do I do?

1072
01:04:35,022 --> 01:04:39,297
[It seems as though
he's caught something again...]

1073
01:04:39,298 --> 01:04:40,610
Did he catch another one?

1074
01:04:45,026 --> 01:04:47,994
[Caught another one!]

1075
01:04:49,700 --> 01:04:52,802
[His third catch!]

1076
01:04:53,468 --> 01:04:56,237
Jae Suk!
I'm the man!

1077
01:04:56,238 --> 01:04:59,296
- Stop acting like a brat to me!
- I haven't caught a single one!

1078
01:05:00,939 --> 01:05:02,131
It's Ji Hyo.

1079
01:05:03,749 --> 01:05:05,925
- Hey, Ji Hyo.
- Hi Jae Suk.

1080
01:05:05,926 --> 01:05:06,979
What is it?

1081
01:05:06,980 --> 01:05:11,470
- Are you making anything yet?
- Things are crazy over here.

1082
01:05:12,582 --> 01:05:15,449
- We're catching a ton of fish over here.
- Take a picture.

1083
01:05:15,450 --> 01:05:18,258
[Even picture proof.]

1084
01:05:18,259 --> 01:05:20,663
- We're fishing right now.
- Fishing?

1085
01:05:20,664 --> 01:05:23,506
This must be... 50cm? 60cm?

1086
01:05:23,507 --> 01:05:28,934
- You're not cooking?
- We're still gathering up our ingredients.

1087
01:05:30,327 --> 01:05:32,885
- She's already started cooking?
- When are you going to start cooking?

1088
01:05:32,886 --> 01:05:36,280
I'm calling because we've already finished
cooking and our dish is so delicious.

1089

How can you be cooking already?

1090
01:05:37,906 --> 01:05:40,414
Anyways, make sure that your dish is good.
We're catching...

1091
01:05:40,415 --> 01:05:44,057

and with the cooking. See you later.

bring it to a boil to deepen the flavors.]

while that comes to a boil.

the soup is brought back to a boil.]

1099

A delicious king crab dinner.

1102
01:06:40,313 --> 01:06:46,736
We're going to cook king crabs which is ideal
for many people to share over dinner.

1103

I need to know how to make this right.

1106
01:06:56,230 --> 01:06:57,839
This is all about the effort you put in.

1107
01:06:57,840 --> 01:07:01,818
You have to mix it by hand without
using those plastic gloves.

1108
01:07:01,819 --> 01:07:04,485
This is how you give it that authentic taste.

1109
01:07:04,486 --> 01:07:08,048
There's one other thing that you need to add.
Something that can't be left out.

- Here it is!
- Spicy pepper paste!

- Can I taste it?

- There's cooked ground beef in that paste.

1116

- Then what can I do to help?
- See this onion?

We need to mince that too
and mix it in here.

1124
01:08:07,972 --> 01:08:11,487
It gets too liquidy
if we grind it in the mixer.

1125
01:08:11,488 --> 01:08:15,954
- So we have to mince it all by hand.
- Doing it by hand is the best, right?

1126
01:08:18,728 --> 01:08:21,504
That must be why everyone stresses
the importance of doing it by hand.

1127
01:08:22,229 --> 01:08:24,253
This is all about the love and effort
you put into it.

01:08:27,942 --> 01:08:31,139
[Love is a huge ingredient of
any successful dish!]

1130
01:08:31,140 --> 01:08:33,233
that must be the infamous naju pear.

1131
01:08:33,234 --> 01:08:34,312
[This is the infamous naju pear!]

1132
01:08:36,923 --> 01:08:38,423
How is it?

1133
01:08:39,503 --> 01:08:42,223
- It's so sweet. Sweet as honey.
- Sweet as honey?

1134
01:08:44,961 --> 01:08:46,491
Is it good?

1135
01:08:46,492 --> 01:08:49,199
- That's so sweet.
- That's how good naju pears are.

1136
01:08:49,200 --> 01:08:50,953
It's so refreshing.

1137
01:08:50,954 --> 01:08:53,391
[The special combination of sweet
and refreshing within these pears.]

1138
01:08:56,019 --> 01:08:59,547
I think this is the perfect dish for us.
It's not too difficult to make.

1139
01:08:59,911 --> 01:09:03,562
The best thing about this is...
while prepping the ingredients...

1140
01:09:03,563 --> 01:09:05,758
- All my stress seems to be melting away.
- Right?

1141
01:09:07,700 --> 01:09:11,538
I feel like I'm dicing away all my built up
stress and frustrations with my knife.

1142
01:09:13,908 --> 01:09:17,609
Mince up the meat first,
then mince up the onion...

1143
01:09:17,610 --> 01:09:19,775
and mince up the pear too.

1144
01:09:19,776 --> 01:09:22,830
This is homemade soy sauce that
I made at home myself.

1145
01:09:22,831 --> 01:09:24,680
- You made it yourself?
- Of course.

1146
01:09:24,681 --> 01:09:27,212
As old as this house is...

1147
01:09:27,213 --> 01:09:30,307
We've been adding on newer batches of soy
sauce to the original batch from 200 years ago.

1148
01:09:30,308 --> 01:09:33,214
We just keep adding on newer batches
to the existing batch through the years.

1149
01:09:33,215 --> 01:09:37,602
See this sugar?
You need to add a bit of sugar to this.

1150
01:09:37,603 --> 01:09:42,014
[Adding a little bit of the sugar to
the mixture will bring out the luster.]

1151
01:09:42,676 --> 01:09:44,707
You always add some to any meat dish.

1152
01:09:44,708 --> 01:09:47,964
You always have to add a bit of ginger
to any beef dish.

1153
01:09:47,965 --> 01:09:53,420
[Adding a small amount of ginger to meat dish
will eliminate the heavy scent and taste.]

1154
01:09:59,898 --> 01:10:03,513
- Your hands must be so cold, Gary.
- It's okay. My hands are nice and warm!

1155
01:10:03,514 --> 01:10:05,022
[Cheery Servant Gary.]

1156
01:10:06,266 --> 01:10:08,772
- Add a spoonful of sesame oil.
- Sesame oil, okay!

1157
01:10:08,773 --> 01:10:11,938
[A big spoonful of the sesame oil.]

1158
01:10:14,682 --> 01:10:16,197
That looks so good.

1159
01:10:16,198 --> 01:10:18,928
[Set it aside to let the flavors meld.]

1160
01:10:22,280 --> 01:10:26,213
[Preparing the fire
in the traditional hearth.]

1161
01:10:31,279 --> 01:10:34,273
The wood coal is prepared like this.

1162
01:10:34,274 --> 01:10:36,251
This is amazing.

1163
01:10:38,216 --> 01:10:41,752
[Even the soy sauce condiment for
basting the kebabs with is ready.]

1164
01:10:41,753 --> 01:10:44,146
- You don't add any hot pepper flakes.
- Okay.

1165
01:10:48,657 --> 01:10:50,985
- You're shaping it?
- Yes, we've got to shape it.

1166
01:10:50,986 --> 01:10:52,493
Can I shape mine into a heart?

1167
01:10:52,494 --> 01:10:56,267
You can do it however you'd like
But traditionally...

1168
01:10:56,268 --> 01:10:59,837
This is how you shape it to
prevent it from crumbling apart.

1169
01:10:59,838 --> 01:11:04,909
So until it's somewhat cooked,
you can't really touch it.

1170
01:11:04,910 --> 01:11:06,817
Shall we try cooking this now?

1171
01:11:08,006 --> 01:11:11,197
[It's time to cook it on the coals!]

1172
01:11:13,378 --> 01:11:14,701
I can smell it!

1173
01:11:16,926 --> 01:11:18,294
Smell that.

1174
01:11:20,784 --> 01:11:23,560
- You're doing a good job.
- That smells so good.

1175
01:11:27,924 --> 01:11:32,551
- You sound like an expert, Jae Kyung.
- This is great for my stress relief.

1176
01:11:34,605 --> 01:11:39,178
[As if simmering herbal tonics...]

1177
01:11:39,179 --> 01:11:45,159
[Made with their love and effort.]

1178
01:11:47,052 --> 01:11:51,087
The waves are so calm that
it actually feels like we're out on a pond.

1179
01:11:54,516 --> 01:11:57,992
This is what everyone does at least once
whenever you're on a boat.

1180
01:12:02,449 --> 01:12:07,331
[We'll do it too!
A scene from Titanic!]

1181
01:12:08,845 --> 01:12:12,556
[I feel like I'm flying, Suk Jin!]

1182
01:12:12,557 --> 01:12:15,176
The victory will be ours!

1183
01:12:21,084 --> 01:12:24,814
[You just wait... we're coming!]

1184
01:12:30,992 --> 01:12:32,850
- That must be it.
- That's it.

1185
01:12:32,851 --> 01:12:37,876
That must be it.
I hear that's really good for you.

1186
01:12:37,877 --> 01:12:39,979
It's all over this place.

1187
01:12:40,861 --> 01:12:44,745
['Teot' is all over the place.]

1188
01:12:46,881 --> 01:12:51,071
We've got it!
It's Teot!

1189
01:12:53,114 --> 01:12:56,354
- Just pull it off.
- The freshest ingredients possible.

1190
01:12:56,355 --> 01:12:59,697
[Teot to add to their oyster dish.]

1191
01:12:59,698 --> 01:13:02,107
Take a look at where we're at,
and what we're doing.

1192
01:13:02,108 --> 01:13:05,637
- We're on the ocean right now.
- Sitting on top of the ocean.

1193
01:13:05,638 --> 01:13:09,547
[Two middle aged men gathering
Teot out in the ocean.]

1194
01:13:10,419 --> 01:13:13,301
[Kwang Soo and John Park are
at a famed noodle master's place.]

1195
01:13:14,099 --> 01:13:15,753
My name is Jo Sung Jong.

1196
01:13:16,679 --> 01:13:18,569
Making the dough is very simple.

1197
01:13:18,570 --> 01:13:21,187
- Is it made of buckwheat flour?
- Yes, it's a buckwheat flour mix.

1198
01:13:21,905 --> 01:13:26,428
We're going to add some water,
and some yeast to the dough.

1199
01:13:26,429 --> 01:13:30,277
- There can't be any air in the dough.
- No air pockets?

1200
01:13:30,920 --> 01:13:32,667
Let's get started.

1201
01:13:32,668 --> 01:13:35,009
[The expert's demonstration.]

1202
01:13:39,498 --> 01:13:43,893
Would it be okay if we got off of our knees
since we're not mixing the dough yet?

1203
01:13:43,894 --> 01:13:46,135
Let's stay respectful.

1204
01:13:47,419 --> 01:13:51,152
[The Giraffe isn't fully understanding
the sacredness of this lesson.]

1205
01:13:51,828 --> 01:13:55,312
[Kwang-Park couple also trying their hand
at making the dough.]

1206
01:13:58,473 --> 01:14:02,819
[A sacred atmosphere for their lesson.]

1207
01:14:02,820 --> 01:14:06,251
I ask that all the viewers also kneel down
as they watch our segment.

1208
01:14:06,252 --> 01:14:09,227
[Do you want them to change their
channels on you?]

1209
01:14:09,228 --> 01:14:12,805
- This is what you want.
- It already forms into that shape?

1210
01:14:12,806 --> 01:14:15,506
[The expert's dough is already taking shape.]

1211
01:14:18,493 --> 01:14:20,911
[What are you doing?]

1212
01:14:22,977 --> 01:14:24,973
You're not going to get any
noodles from that.

1213
01:14:26,064 --> 01:14:29,134
[His dough is stuck all over his hands.]

1214
01:14:29,135 --> 01:14:31,185
Is that to make some sort of
sticky bread?

1215
01:14:31,186 --> 01:14:34,443
- Did I add too much water?
- Yes, you added too much water.

1216
01:14:37,174 --> 01:14:40,029
[Dough expert?
John Park's dough is taking shape.]

1217
01:14:41,536 --> 01:14:44,640
[Even the expert is giving
John credit for his skills.]

1218
01:14:44,641 --> 01:14:46,995
I think you should be in charge
of making the dough.

1219
01:14:52,736 --> 01:14:55,936
[Perfectly shaped noodles.]

1220
01:14:57,866 --> 01:15:00,484
How long do you boil it for?

1221
01:15:00,485 --> 01:15:03,601
- One minute five seconds.
- A minute and five seconds?

1222
01:15:03,602 --> 01:15:06,261
- You have to count it in your head.
- Are you counting?

1223
01:15:14,274 --> 01:15:18,588
[Must rinse it under cold running water
before the noodles start to get soggy.]

1224
01:15:27,186 --> 01:15:30,130
[In the bowl and it's complete.]

1225
01:15:31,726 --> 01:15:36,121
[Squeeze out the excess water,
and wrap it into a ball and put into a bowl.]

1226

[John Park's turn to give it a try.]

1227
01:15:42,831 --> 01:15:46,349
[He really is noodle Park!]

1228
01:15:48,295 --> 01:15:50,866
Add some spicy sauce to it.

1229
01:15:52,988 --> 01:15:54,739
Then some sesame seeds.

1230
01:15:55,464 --> 01:16:04,858
[Add spicy sauce, sesame seeds, seaweed,
and sugar in that exact order.]

1231
01:16:04,859 --> 01:16:08,322
[And finish it off with a squirt
of some sesame oil.]

1232
01:16:10,685 --> 01:16:15,271
[Adding the sesame oil makes it look more
appetizing as well as the added flavor.]

1233

[Giraffe tries to follow
the expert's example.]

1234
01:16:24,374 --> 01:16:25,908
Wow, that looks so good.

1235
01:16:26,971 --> 01:16:30,863
- What is that? It's just seaweed.
- It looks like a rice ball.

1236
01:16:30,864 --> 01:16:33,017
You added too much seaweed.

1237
01:16:33,018 --> 01:16:35,647
That's seaweed noodles.

1238
01:16:37,494 --> 01:16:40,443
[While all the cooking secrets
are being gathered...]

- You did great.

She told Jae Kyung to just leave it.

1244
01:16:59,072 --> 01:17:02,479
When you and I both quit singing,
we should open up a restaurant.

1245

[And the taste?]

1246
01:17:08,542 --> 01:17:10,333
We got first place.

first place.

assured of their winnings.]

to figure out the ratio of the ingredients.]

and I've got nothing left for myself.

1256

all the meat.

I think it would be safe for us to make
two different dishes.

1259
01:17:56,505 --> 01:17:59,242
- I thought we only needed to make one.
- I vote for this dish...

1260
01:17:59,243 --> 01:18:01,602
- And that other dish.
- Hot and sour fish?

01:20:10,340 --> 01:20:11,815
As soon as I started!

1291
01:20:14,367 --> 01:20:17,879
[Suddenly breaks out in a fight?]

1292
01:20:18,917 --> 01:20:21,669
What the heck is this?
As soon as we started!

1293
01:20:22,225 --> 01:20:24,214
Childhood memories, my butt!

1294
01:20:27,661 --> 01:20:30,553
Okay, Dummy.
Give me a piggyback ride for losing.

1295
01:20:34,610 --> 01:20:37,378
Do you know how hard it'll be to give you
a piggyback ride on the sand?

1296
01:20:38,531 --> 01:20:40,649
I came all the way here
just for you too!

1297
01:20:43,392 --> 01:20:47,936
[Giving her a piggyback ride
all the way back to the car.]

1298
01:20:48,522 --> 01:20:52,101
[Blank Ji automatically breaks out
into a song.]

1299
01:20:52,102 --> 01:20:54,493
Your lyrics are all wrong.

1300
01:20:56,208 --> 01:20:58,240
My pants are about to fall off.

1301
01:21:02,423 --> 01:21:05,532
[Ha Ha still hasn't given up on introducing
Jeonju's son to the crowd.]

1302
01:21:05,533 --> 01:21:08,282
Okay, everyone.
He is the son of Jeonju!

1303
01:21:08,777 --> 01:21:10,766
The pride of Jeonju!

1304
01:21:10,767 --> 01:21:13,454
I'd like to introduce Infinite's Sung Kyu!

1305
01:21:13,455 --> 01:21:17,296
Please welcome him
with a huge round of applause.

1306
01:21:17,297 --> 01:21:22,201
Would you all like to join hands and play
a round of Ring Around the Rosie?

1307
01:21:22,202 --> 01:21:24,542
[Proposes a round of Ring Around The Rosie?]

1308
01:21:33,243 --> 01:21:35,201
To the other side!

1309
01:21:37,978 --> 01:21:39,684
Four people!

1310
01:21:42,723 --> 01:21:45,483
I can't believe they're doing
everything I tell them to do.

1311
01:21:48,071 --> 01:21:51,919
[Preparations for the competition
are now complete.]

1312
01:21:51,920 --> 01:21:53,790
We don't have time to fool
around anymore.

1313
01:21:53,791 --> 01:21:55,160
We're running late.

1314
01:21:56,251 --> 01:21:59,398
[Time for everyone to rush off
to the competition stage!]

1315
01:22:01,015 --> 01:22:02,517
[The sun is starting to set...]

1316
01:22:02,518 --> 01:22:04,880

01:22:14,105 --> 01:22:17,844
<i>Come to the competition stage in Seoul's
Taepyeong District.</i>

1320
01:22:17,845 --> 01:22:20,431
<i>You will not be able to participate if
you're not there on time.</i>

1321
01:22:20,432 --> 01:22:24,665
[Unable to participate in the competition
if they're not on time.]

1322
01:22:25,881 --> 01:22:30,132
[This is... where the battle will take place.]

1323
01:22:30,133 --> 01:22:31,472
Hello?

1324
01:22:31,473 --> 01:22:34,079
- Hi, Jae Kyung.
- Mom, it's me.

1325
01:22:34,080 --> 01:22:37,645
I have to make Sanjeok today.

1326
01:22:37,646 --> 01:22:40,543
- Take some large scallions...
- Okay, scallions?

1327
01:22:40,544 --> 01:22:48,051
<i>Dice both the white and the green parts
into a length that's about one cm.</i>

1328
01:22:48,052 --> 01:22:51,216
<i>You have to dice it all really fine.</i>

1329
01:22:52,116 --> 01:22:54,447
Look at how good Jae Kyung is
with that knife.

1330
01:22:54,448 --> 01:22:56,896
[I'm a Chef's daughter!]

1331
01:22:56,897 --> 01:23:00,581
[Jae Kyung's hidden cooking talents
are about to be revealed!]

1332
01:23:01,635 --> 01:23:06,754
I can usually tell what's in a dish
when I taste the food.

1333
01:23:06,755 --> 01:23:07,841
- Really?
- Yes.

1334
01:23:07,876 --> 01:23:13,307
[Kyung Ho can guess which ingredients are
used in a dish when he tastes the food?]

1335
01:23:13,710 --> 01:23:16,367
- I always thought that was cool.
- You're a cooking genius.

1336
01:23:17,798 --> 01:23:21,799
[But...]

1337
01:23:21,800 --> 01:23:23,161
It's too bland.

1338
01:23:24,040 --> 01:23:25,799
- This is way too sweet.
- It's too sweet?

1339
01:23:27,366 --> 01:23:29,409
[The Rocker's mental breakdown.]

1340
01:23:29,410 --> 01:23:31,858
- A spoonful of soy sauce...
- And sesame oil.

1341
01:23:31,859 --> 01:23:35,997
[These two are trying to memorize the recipe
given to them by the master.]

1342
01:23:36,613 --> 01:23:38,198
[This is going to be perfect.]

1343
01:23:39,521 --> 01:23:41,270
Did I already put
the sesame seeds in here?

1344
01:23:42,508 --> 01:23:46,009
[My mind has gone completely blank...]

1345
01:23:46,010 --> 01:23:47,743
- We have to stir-fry this?
- We have to stir-fry it.

1346
01:23:47,744 --> 01:23:49,485
This too?

1347
01:23:51,361 --> 01:23:54,571
[Can't remember...]

1348
01:23:56,766 --> 01:23:59,725
In a big porcelain bowl...

1349
01:24:00,330 --> 01:24:02,795
Just like that.

1350
01:24:02,796 --> 01:24:05,741
[Does this team have a secret weapon?]

1351
01:24:07,859 --> 01:24:09,475
The egg broke!

1352
01:24:10,195 --> 01:24:13,983
[Who knew that their secret weapon
would self-destruct on them?]

1353
01:24:15,339 --> 01:24:17,978
Are you trying to bring
a dead chicken back to life?

1354
01:24:19,375 --> 01:24:21,380
Are you bringing a dead chicken
back to life?

1355
01:24:23,860 --> 01:24:26,706
[Noodle mania studying hard
on their course of action.]

1356
01:24:26,707 --> 01:24:28,349
You're really detailed.

1357
01:24:29,352 --> 01:24:31,795
We just need to do everything
that's written on here.

1358
01:24:34,049 --> 01:24:36,823
[But...]

1359
01:24:36,824 --> 01:24:40,741
[The dough is the problem!]

1360
01:24:40,742 --> 01:24:43,587
Is it okay to serve it like this?

1361
01:24:44,704 --> 01:24:46,631
What if we get cussed out?

1362
01:24:49,511 --> 01:24:54,086
[It's almost time!
The start time is looming above their heads!]

1363
01:24:54,087 --> 01:24:58,034
[Run!]

1364
01:24:59,755 --> 01:25:01,584
It's John Park!

1365
01:25:02,730 --> 01:25:04,383
Only two minutes left.

1366
01:25:05,256 --> 01:25:06,494
There they are.

1367
01:25:06,495 --> 01:25:08,911
- John Park!
- I didn't know it was you.

1368
01:25:08,912 --> 01:25:13,088
[Everyone's finally arrived
at the cooking stadium.]

1369
01:25:14,699 --> 01:25:16,639
It's the Clubber Brother.

1370
01:25:17,731 --> 01:25:22,169
[The two clubbers greet each other
enthusiastically.]

1371
01:25:22,170 --> 01:25:25,387
[A little awkward to be seeing each other
in a brightly lit up place.]

1372
01:25:28,870 --> 01:25:33,475
[Time for the judging panel
to make their appearance.]

1373
01:25:33,476 --> 01:25:34,673
Who could they be?

1374
01:25:36,167 --> 01:25:39,900
[The first judge.]

1375
01:25:39,901 --> 01:25:42,493
[Celebrity Chef- Raymond Kim.]

1376
01:25:51,073 --> 01:25:54,913
[Everyone's shocked to see someone so
famous entering their arena.]

1377
01:25:55,272 --> 01:25:58,018
[Followed by...]

1378
01:25:58,019 --> 01:26:01,441
[Traditional Korean cooking expert-
Shim Young Soon.]

1379
01:26:15,842 --> 01:26:18,927
[Webtoon author- Jung Da Jung.]

1380
01:26:19,803 --> 01:26:25,884

[The last member of the judging panel.]

1382
01:26:30,394 --> 01:26:33,788
[Chocolatier, Louie Kang.]

1383
01:26:44,174 --> 01:26:48,118
[The biggest cooking masters in
Korea are here as their judges!]

1384
01:26:48,119 --> 01:26:49,635
How are we to live up to their standards?

1385
01:26:50,091 --> 01:26:55,095
[They have to satisfy their taste buds.]

1386
01:26:55,096 --> 01:26:58,944
- This is no joke.
- May I call you 'Mother'?

1387
01:27:04,848 --> 01:27:08,445
- Why are you even asking her that?
- She just looks so maternal. That's why.

1388
01:27:09,426 --> 01:27:11,629
Sis... you remember me, don't you?

1389
01:27:14,540 --> 01:27:16,739
She doesn't go clubbing, Soo Hong.

1390
01:27:16,740 --> 01:27:21,019
I'm telling you that I've met her before.
So I'm asking her if she remembers me.

1391
01:27:21,020 --> 01:27:23,261
Whether you call me 'Mother' or 'Sis'...

1392
01:27:23,262 --> 01:27:26,987
That's not going to make any difference
in my judging.

1393
01:27:26,988 --> 01:27:28,807
[Stay alert!]

1394
01:27:28,808 --> 01:27:31,323
- That's wrong!
- This isn't how I do it?

1395
01:27:32,561 --> 01:27:34,499
You totally ruined the dish.

1396
01:27:36,573 --> 01:27:40,195
[Only the taste will be judged.]
