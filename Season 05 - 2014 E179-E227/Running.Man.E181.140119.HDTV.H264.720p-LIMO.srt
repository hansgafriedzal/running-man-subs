00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,390
I guess I'm the first one here.

- Go get me some strawberry milk.

00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:29,780
Seriously.

19
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:32,040
I was just kidding.

20
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:36,100
Don't joke around like that.
Why are we four the only ones here?

21
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:38,310
As you may already know...

22
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:43,130
male and female students of this school
are on very bad terms.

23
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:46,670
Why is that?
Wait... is Jong Kook playing a girl today?

24
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:50,810
[That means that they'll be battling
the female students today...]

- Why are you suddenly acting afraid?
- Sit back like this.

26
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:59,590
- Who is it?
- Okay.

27
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:06,900
[They don't seem very comfortable as they
try to act like a group of delinquents.]

- I'm sorry about earlier.
- Do you want a beating?

29
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:10,940

- What are you guys doing?
- You used to play around a bit, didn't you?

34
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:25,930
Just from your expression alone,
I can guarantee you used to play around.

35

- What is this? Seriously.
- It's the latest fashion.

36
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:34,600
- Do something with that hair of yours?
- Why? I think she's adorable.

37
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,510
What did you just say?

38
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:42,990
[Bad terms or not...
that has nothing to do with me.]

39
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:46,850
Why don't you call in the other delinquents
that you hang around with?

40
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:49,240
- Don't even worry about it.
- This is war!

41
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,530
- This is war!
- This really is war!

This is my friend.

59
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:55,280
Why are you doing this to me?
I just walked in the room!

60
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,960
Why are you being like this to a girl?
Why are you doing this to me?

61
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,540
[A face that invites a flying fist.]

62
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:04,600

- You!
- You!

I dated her for about two days,
and she really is nothing to look at.

68
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:21,690

73
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:46,770
I can't tell you that!

74
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:51,690
- I can't tell you that!
- What am I going to do with her?

[An old flame with nothing but
bad feelings for each other.]

76
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:57,200
- I'm so disappointed in you.
- I still have more friends waiting outside.

77
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,700
- You still have more friends?
- Don't you know who's on our team?

78
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:02,080
- Why? Who do you have?
- We have Samson on our team.

79
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:06,350
- Samson? Could it be Jong Sook?
- It can't be Jong Sook, can it?

80
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:08,970
Come on in, my pretty friend.

81
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:11,400
It can't possibly be Jong Sook.

82
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,410
[HI!]

83
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:21,600
[Falters backwards.]

This is my friend.

- Are you a girl?
- Why? What's wrong with it?

86
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:30,830
- That's not a girl.
- Why is your body so buff?

87
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:33,730
- Do you know how much I love art?
- What are you talking about?

88
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:35,470
It's my dream to grow up
to be a good wife and a mother...

89
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:36,720
And I'm a great cook.

[The winner of last week's
cooking battle, Jong Sook.]

91

Hey, guys.

92
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:46,670
You think chicken is
the only thing I know how to boil?

93
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:49,000
I can boil you guys too.

94
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:52,760
You're doing great, Jong Sook!

95
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:56,020
I know I can boil you guys up.

96
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:58,610
We're not going to go easy on you
like we would with other girls.

97
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:02,540
What?
You think I carry this around to draw with?

98
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,900
- Are you a boy or a girl?
- You think this is to draw with?

99
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:10,040
- What are you?
- You're doing great!

00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,170
[The girls team is feeling confident
with Jong Sook on their side.]

101
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:16,300
- I can't believe it's Jong Sook.
- She really is scary.

102
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:19,880
What you need to know is that Jong Sook
is not even the leader of our team.

103
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,980
- Who?
- It's not me. There's someone else.

104
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:23,960
- Who is it?
- Who else could there be?

105
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:30,660
[There's another student who's
even more frightening than Jong Sook?]

106
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:40,770
[Park Bo Young]

107
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:44,670
[The embodiment of ferociousness, Bo Young.]

108
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:51,490
[Makes her return as the legendary fighter.]

109
00:06:55,370 --> 00:07:00,450
[Bo Young is the leader
whom even Jong Sook bows down to?]

110
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:02,230
Kneel down!

111
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:05,200
Sis!
We're all here.

112
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:09,040
- She is so cute.
- How can she be a leader? She's so cute!

113
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,060
[Most adorable leader in the world?]

114
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:14,370
- You watch your mouths!
- You're the one who should be careful.

115
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:17,610
How did you even become a leader
of your bully group?

116
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:21,140
- I feel a bit awkward right now...
- Stop talking in casual speech with her!

117
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:23,020
She's older you!

118
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:25,960
- She's older than me?
- That's right! I'm older than you!

119
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:28,600
But this guy is way older than
the rest of us.

120
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:31,330
[A brother who's way above
the rest of the group.]

121
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:34,490
- He's no joke.
- His age is no joke.

122
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:37,460
Your dad and I had a drink together
last week.

123
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:41,810
Why is there an extra member on
their team?

124
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:45,570
That's why there's a male student who just
transferred to this school.

125
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:48,220
[Another transfer student!]

126
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:02,200
[Flower boy transfer student, Lee Jong Suk.]

127
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:04,680
- Bro!
- Bro!

128
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,840
[Everyone automatically
starts to call him their 'Bro'.]

129
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:11,660
He's my boyfriend!

130
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:14,250
- Get out of there!
- It's our 100th day anniversary tomorrow.

131
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:16,900
- We've been dating for a hundred days!
- You must be dreaming.

132
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:19,250
We kissed yesterday!

133
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:22,640
[Oh my God...]

134
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,890
Wait, you kissed him even though
you've already kissed Jae Suk?

135
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:27,980
[Man killer, Kwang Ja?]

136
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:30,650
- I can't believe that Jong Suk is here.
- Really... Jong Suk.

137
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:35,120
[The boys team's image has skyrocketed
with Jong Suk joining their team.]

138
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:37,700
These three girls are all starry-eyed.

139
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:40,740
They look like
they've all fallen for him already.

140
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:43,530
- You look like you've fallen for him too.
- No, not me.

141
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:45,840
[Even Jong Sook is
getting a little starry-eyed?]

142
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:48,410
Were you just playing me?

143
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:51,390
- Just keep adding Yoo Jae Suk.
- No!

144
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,790
- I know that you still have feelings for her.
- Me?

145
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:56,150
[Jae Suk still has feelings for Kwang Ja?]

146
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:58,490
So you're the one who's been calling me
with blocked caller ID?

147
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:07,190
As you may all already know,
Running High School

148
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:10,730
is infamous for the bad blood that exists
between the male and female students.

149
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:16,990
You will be competing male vs female students
to end the battle for once and for all.

150
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:19,450
The race that you all will be
participating in today...

151
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:23,250
is called, the Rural Romance.

152
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:26,280
- Rural?
- Are we going out to a farm?

153
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:29,160
- We're not...
- You're not...

154
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,820
- Not the rice paddy, is it?
- In the middle of this cold winter?

155
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:34,110
Who would be crazy enough to go out
to a rice paddy in this kind of weather?

156
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:37,580
- Our producers would.
- No way.

157
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:39,260
[You know us well.]

158
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:47,290
[But... there's a couple who's been dating
in secret amongst this group.]

159
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,610
- We made each other a promise.
- Who is it?

160
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:59,430
[Attacks Jong Suk?]

161
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:03,490
He just sniffed me.

162
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:06,470
I didn't sniff you!

163
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:11,150
- When did I sniff you?
- This race is to find out who the couple is.

164
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:14,240
[Find out who the secret lovebirds are!]

165
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,870
[A hint to help them find out who the secret
couple is will be given to the game winners.]

166
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:23,480
[Will it be the secret couple's victory,
or the rest of the students' victory?]

167
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,840
[You're all dead!]

168
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:27,260
So you must find out who the tragic,
and desperate couple is.

169
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:32,080
[Which of the two are involved
in a secret love affair?]

170
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,420
<i>It's not me, so you're all dead.

171
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:39,260
[But why... is Jong Suk acting like that?]

172
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:43,560
[An hour ago...]

173
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,900
A letter?

174
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:50,410
[What could be in the letter that
Jong Suk received?]

175
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,760
<i>Hi Jong Suk.

176
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:57,930
<i>I feel like this secret love affair
that we've been having...

177
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:04,570
<i>I feel like it's been quite a while already
since we've started this secret love affair.

178
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:06,560
[Jong Suk is one of the star crossed lovers.]

179
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:10,660
<i>I know that everyone in this school is
constantly at each other's throats.

180
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:16,920
<i>So I'm sure that they'll all go crazy if they
find out that we're dating in secret, right?

181
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:24,250
<i>I heard that there's going to be a race
between the boys and the girls today.

182
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:29,270
<i>But if we succeed the mission without
others finding out that we're a couple

183
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:32,300
<i>then I'm told that we no longer
have to keep dating in secret.

184
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:35,540
Who could it be?

185
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:38,040
Who is...

186
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:40,390
What do I do?

187
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:45,640
To be involved in a secret love affair
in this day and age...

188
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:51,610
So you're telling me that I have a girlfriend,
but you won't tell me who it is?

189
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:56,500
[Sweet and innocent Jong Suk is nervous
just at the mention of a secret affair.]

190
00:11:57,530 --> 00:12:00,400
Who would you like for your
girlfriend to be?

191
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,340
A girl who has a pretty neck...

192
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,370
with a bit of an obsessive personality.

193
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:11,800
I want to be loved.

194
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:22,310
[Who could be his girlfriend
who sent him this letter?]

195
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:33,890
[She's here!]

196
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:40,560
[Jong Suk's secret girlfriend
is none other than...]

197
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,690
Is he my partner?
Thank you!

198
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:48,820
[Running High's Juliet, Ji Hyo.]

199
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:51,230
- I'm his girlfriend?
- He's your boyfriend.

200
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:55,750
What took you so long to come clean
about our relationship?

201
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:59,140
- I didn't even know that we were dating.
- I know. Me neither.

202
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:03,760
[Running High's Romeo and Juliet-
Jong Suk and Ji Hyo.]

203
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:07,110
- What should we do?
- I don't really understand it.

204
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:11,580
You don't understand?
My partner's intelligence level is a bit...

205
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:16,220
No, that was just a joke.

206
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:18,030
We need to be confirmed as a couple.

207
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:23,490
[Girlfriend Blank Ji is calmly explaining
today's race to him.]

208
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,990
This mission is saying that we have to imitate
the pose that two of the producers

209
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:30,970
are doing for three seconds.

210
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:36,560
We need to do it when we're around the other
members and make it pretty obvious

211
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,000
but we have to make sure not to
get caught by them.

212
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,600
- Do you understand it now?
- So make sure not to get caught, right?

213
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,630
- Without anyone knowing.
- Hold the pose for three seconds.

214
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:49,330
[Their couple mission is going to get
increasingly more difficult with each game.]

215
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:54,690
[If they succeed their own missions,
they can give out fake hints to others.]

216
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:58,480
[More fake hints that are given out,
then more advantageous it'll be for them.]

217
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,470
- Let's do our best today, boyfriend.
- Yes, Ma'am... I mean, okay.

218
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:06,350
You're not doing this for your love,
but this is to win the gold...

219
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:08,570
No, we're in love.

220
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:10,200
Yes, we're in love.

221
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,610
We're in love, but this is only
our second time seeing each other.

222
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:14,260
- So we're just feeling a little shy.
- We're just a little shy right now.

223
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:17,500
We really are boyfriend and girlfriend,
but we're feeling a little shy right now.

224
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:20,550
- Just let us be in love.
- Just leave our love be.

225
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:23,570
Just allow us to be in love.
Why do we have to keep our love a secret?

226
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:26,810
This is only the second time that we're
seeing each other in a whole year.

227
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,840
[Anyways, Jong Suk and Ji Hyo
are the secret couple.]

228
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,900
- So one of them is dating one of us?
- Yeah, that's exactly it.

229
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:40,470
That's so exciting!

230
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:43,390
- That's really exciting.
- Why are you getting so excited?

231
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:45,790
By the way, today is Tuesday.

232
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:48,660
Okay, fine.

233
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:50,780
[Sorry about today, Gary...]

234
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,800
[His mouth is getting dry as sandpaper.]

235
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,680
- Why are you discounting me?
- I don't think that it's you.

236
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,620
- Why not?
- It could be Kwang Ja.

237
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:01,340
She could be dating him.
She really could be dating Jong Suk.

238
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:04,980
Just make sure that your team does
their best to win every game.

239
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:08,210
- Let's make our way to the first game.
- Let's go!

240
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:20,530
[Will these two... be able to bring
their love out into the open?]

241
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,480
- Go away, Kang Gary.
- Yeah, Kang Gary.

242
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:28,510
[Time to start Jong Suk and
Ji Hyo's secret love affair mission.]

243
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:34,730
But I do feel more reassured knowing that
Kwang Ja and Jong Sook are on our team.

244
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:36,900
Just put your faith in us and
follow our lead.

245
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:40,580
I don't feel that Kwang Ja's very
trustworthy.

246
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:43,790
But let's be honest with each other.
Which one of you is it?

247
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:46,020
[Blank Ji is bringing up the subject first
to avoid receiving any type of suspicion.]

248
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:47,690
I'm lonely enough already as is...

249
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:49,870
I vow to find out who the couple is myself.

250
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:52,790
I don't think it's one of the two
that are sitting up front, do you?

251
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:55,860
But it's also possible that...

252
00:15:56,260 --> 00:16:00,390
it could be one of the two guys
who are disguised as girls today.

253
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:03,620
[Blank Ji is trying to divert the attention
over to Kwang Ja and Jong Sook.]

254
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:06,050
It could very possibly be Jong Sook.

255
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:10,720
[That clever Blank Ji...
bringing out her acting skills.]

256
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:14,430
Which one from our team is dating
one of the girls on the other team?

257
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:21,630
I don't know which one of you it is,
but how can you be so deceitful?

258
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:25,050
- I know.
- I bet you it's Jae Suk.

259
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,410
[Ha Ha suspects Jae Suk.]

260
00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:30,640
- It's him, isn't it?
- I guarantee it.

261
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:34,470
[Everyone on this team suspects Jae Suk.]

262
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:38,000
[Blatantly obvious about his relief.]

263
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,900
You can beat me if it's me.

264
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:43,730
It would be way too obvious
if it were Jong Suk.

265
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:47,280
- Jong Suk would be way too obvious.
- And it wouldn't be any fun either.

266
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:53,600
- I think that it's Jae Suk, and his eyes...
- He's being very obvious about it.

267
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,110
[The boys team is so convinced
of themselves.]

268
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:58,370
- Seriously.
- Jong Suk isn't being obvious at all.

269
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:09,980
[Rural Romance's first game-
Arrives at the farming field.]

270
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:13,420
We really are going to a farming field.

271
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:21,090
[Huh?
Those two people are...]

272
00:17:21,090 --> 00:17:25,430
[First mission-
Must imitate the two producers' pose.]

273
00:17:25,430 --> 00:17:29,900
[First mission- Link their arms together.]

274
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:35,580
The others will receive a fake hint.

275
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:38,550
But if we fail,
they're going to get the real hint

276
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:43,550
and it's going to help the members figure out
that we're the secret couple.

277
00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:53,290
[So we're going to have to link our arms
together during the game, right?]

278
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:55,900
Come down this way.

279
00:17:56,860 --> 00:18:00,380
- Why are there three of them?
- Do we have to change our clothes?

280
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:05,330
<i>Proof that we're a couple-
Whenever there are two staff members

281
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:10,420
<i>we have to imitate whatever those two are
doing for three seconds ourselves.

282
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:12,750
<i>We have to make sure that we don't
get caught by the others either.

283
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:14,450
[Will they be able to pull it off?]

284
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:19,130
[But first, it's time to
change into your work pants.]

285
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:21,170
- Work pants.
- They're work pants.

286
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:23,510
I like being out in the farm.

287
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:26,710
- I think it suits me very well.
- Okay, we're all set.

288
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,130
Hey, Jong Suk.
Are those pants too short on you?

289
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:34,330
[The workpants are too short
for Jong Suk's long legs...]

290
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:37,080
Jong Sook is wearing pretty pajama pants.

291
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:40,230
You look really cute
in your pajama pants, Jong Sook.

292
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:42,590
[Fashion leader, Jong Sook.]

293
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:46,170
You keep grabbing my attention, Jong Sook.

294
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:48,100
Then I'm going to stomp all over you.

295
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:53,280
- She doesn't know how to joke around.
- She scares me.

296
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,400
She doesn't know how to joke around.

297
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,880
What are we doing?

298
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,910
This is your first mission of the day.

299
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:02,080
- It's called, 'Straw Platform'.
- I really love that game.

300
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,930
Do you see the two platforms on
either side?

301
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:06,770
Each of the teams will climb up
onto your own respective platform.

302
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:10,640
Then you will race over to the center platform
to stand on top of it without falling off.

303
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:16,110
Only the person left standing on top of
the platform when the whistle sounds, wins.

304
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:18,710
- Just one person?
- That's going to be tough.

305
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:20,970
I think it would be best
to let Jong Sook pass first.

306
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:22,720
[Come and get me.]

307
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,340
The person who passes the mission
will stay out the rest of the mission.

308
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:28,130
So the team who's member is the last person
left remaining loses the mission.

309
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:30,070
- Okay, I understand.
- This is very simple.

310
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:32,150
- Okay!
- It's really soft and fluffy over here.

311
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:40,420
[But... the platform mission isn't
the issue.]

312
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:46,180
[We're going to have to link our arms
together for our own secret mission...]

313
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:50,460
[But how are we going to manage to do that
without the other members noticing?]

314
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:54,630
The game will start
at the sound of my whistle.

315
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:59,300
[Running High's Boys vs Girls.]

316
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:04,190
There's no reason to rush.

317
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:09,190
[Two people will be allowed to pass
during this round.]

318
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:12,100
[Jong Sook is coming!]

319
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:17,820
[Jong Sook roars her way over.]

320
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:29,710
[Come on, Jong Suk!]

321
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:33,900
[Wait for me, Ji Hyo...]

322
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:42,730
[Kwang Ja's fierce blocking.]

323
00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:51,170
[Jong Sook is successfully
holding off two of the boys.]

324
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,850
[Are you sure... that you're a girl?]

325
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:04,960
[Sae Young sees her chance and
gets up on top of the platform.]

326
00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:12,720
[A one on one battle between
Ha Ha and Bo Young on this side.]

327
00:21:22,970 --> 00:21:26,940
[Jong Suk finally manages to get himself
freed from Kwang Ja's grasp.]

328
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:29,190
Get down from there!

329
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:33,640
[It's Jong Sook that throws him down
to the ground this time.]

330
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:38,390
[Persistent Sae Young manages to keep herself
on top of the platform throughout all this.]

331
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:44,670
[And Leader Bo Young is doing whatever
she can to keep Sae Young protected.]

332
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:49,130
[Time over]

333
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:53,830
[Only Sae Young from the girls team
passes this round.]

334
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,810
- Both her legs are up on the platform.
- Are both her legs up above the ground?

335
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:01,940
- Wait...
- Why did you push me so hard, Ji Hyo?

336
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:05,660
[This is all nice and all...]

337
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:09,370
[But when are we ever going to link
our arms together?]

338
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,370
What's wrong with you, Jong Suk?

339
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:17,940
[Sae Young from the girls team
passes the first round.]

340
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:22,340
[Good cook, Jong Sook with more power
than all four of the boys put together.]

341
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:27,570
[I vow to succeed our own
private mission this time around.]

342
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:30,060
I'm going to win this time!

343
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:32,760
- This is war!
- This really is war!

344
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:36,070
- Let's fight!
- Jong Sook really scares me.

345
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:38,850
[All the male students are feeling
so tiny next to Jong Sook.]

346
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:42,970
We have Jong Sook on our side!

347
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:44,670
- Hey, Jong Sook.
- What?

348
00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:47,510
I'm going to punch you
in your liver this time.

349
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:50,090
- Hey!
- I'm going to punch you in the liver.

350
00:22:50,090 --> 00:22:53,150
- Watch yourself, Song Ji Hyo.
- Watch yourself, Kang Gary.

351
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:55,210
You tried to throw me down
to the ground earlier.

352
00:22:55,210 --> 00:22:57,030
[All he's thinking about is the arm linking.]

353
00:22:57,030 --> 00:22:59,390
- We're taking you down this time, Bo Young.
- You're going down, Bo Young.

354
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:01,940
[Big-nose and Ha Ha
are targeting Bo Young.]

355
00:23:02,370 --> 00:23:04,190
- Fine?
- Fine?

356
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:13,040
[Round two]

357
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:17,800
[Jong Sook leads the team
as she did during the first round.]

358
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:23,490
[Jong Sook's power makes the others
come to an automatic halt.]

359
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:32,290
[The secret couple is trying to look natural
linking their arms on top of the platform.]

360
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,310
Come here and just hold still!

361
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:45,910
[A lovers quarrel during the game?]

362
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:56,100
[Leader Bo Young pulls herself up onto
the platform by stepping on Big-nose's back.]

363
00:24:06,430 --> 00:24:09,250
[Seizes his chance, and Jong Suk
pulls himself up onto the platform.]

364
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:13,870
[Oh?]

365
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:16,670
[Blank Ji links her arm through Jong Suk's.]

366
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:20,300
[They must last three seconds
in that pose!]

367
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:23,270
[But just then,
Gary comes onto the scene.]

368
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,380
No, Jong Suk!

369
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:29,410
[Pretending to pull him down
as not to get caught.]

370
00:24:29,410 --> 00:24:31,940
[Gary fortunately doesn't
seem to notice anything.]

371
00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:39,700
[Ah... so close.]

372
00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:43,000
[Jong Sook ups her power again.]

373
00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:46,560
[It's Samson!]

374
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:48,330
Get out of the way!

375
00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:50,830
[Thrown onto the ground.]

376
00:25:00,610 --> 00:25:03,830
[All the male students gets thrown down
onto the ground by Jong Sook.]

377
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:09,340
[Sorry, Ji Hyo...
But I have to survive first.]

378
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:12,560
[You can't be up there alone!]

379
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:16,700
[But Samson comes back onto the scene.]

380
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:28,860
[Jong Suk is seemingly confused from having
been thrown onto the ground by Jong Sook.]

381
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:32,830
[His secret mission or not,
he's only thinking of the platform.]

382
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:35,890
[You can't pass the mission on your own!
Get back down here!]

383
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:40,280
[Time over]

384
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:44,430
[This is no good...]

385
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:48,720
[Jong Suk on the other hand seems
thrilled to have passed this round.]

386
00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:54,720
[Jae Suk and Jong Suk both
pass the round!]

387
00:25:54,730 --> 00:25:56,490
We're over.

388
00:25:56,490 --> 00:25:58,220
We're over now.

389
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:02,310
What were you guys thinking?
You two shouldn't have gone up there.

390
00:26:03,530 --> 00:26:10,240
[With two of their best players out,
what are they going to do with the rest?]

391
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:13,210
That's not a bad idea.

392
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:18,570
[How are they going to stop
Jong Sook now?]

393
00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:20,060
What were you guys thinking for both
of you to get up there together?

394
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:21,800
They were only worried
about their own survival.

395
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:24,710
[Sorry...]

396
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:27,870
- Of all things to forget about...
- Why do you think Jong Sook is there?

397
00:26:27,870 --> 00:26:30,990
What else was I to think in the midst
of all that chaos?

398
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:34,020
- I was just trying to survive.
- I hope that you're happy.

399
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:36,430
That's going to be pure hell.

400
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:39,310
Okay, get ready for Round Three.

401
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:45,440
[But... the bigger danger....
lies for the secret couple.]

402
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,430
- Let's get two of them up there.
- Okay.

403
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:49,040
- How?
- Let's get two of them up there.

404
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:51,850
- We'll just leave one of them behind.
- So we're not going to go up there?

405
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:57,230
[It would be better for Blank Ji to pass
the round to stand next to Jong Suk...]

406
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:00,050
I bet two of those guys are going to
pass this round.

407
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:03,710
[Game start]

408
00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:06,320
[This team is looking somewhat pitiful.]

409
00:27:07,150 --> 00:27:09,890
[On the other hand,
this team looks completely at ease.]

410
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:12,740
What are you guys doing?

411
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:17,720
[Come on girls!]

412
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:22,640
[Should we get a little workout in?]

413
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,930
[The marching giant, Kwang Ja.]

414
00:27:27,930 --> 00:27:30,470
[Samson Jong Sook.]

415
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:33,080
[Leader Bo Young]

416
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:35,710
[Delinquent Ji Hyo]

417
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:40,710
[Intimidating Girls Team.]

418
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,080
I'm scared.

419
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:53,160
- It's Jong Sook!
- No!

420
00:27:55,390 --> 00:27:57,950
- Let's get Gary up there.
- You want to get me up there?

421
00:27:57,950 --> 00:27:59,890
Why?
Don't get me up there!

422
00:27:59,890 --> 00:28:02,860
No, don't get me up there!
I don't want to go up there!

423
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:05,380
[They're pulling Gary up onto the platform?]

424
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:15,180
[The Girls Team is trying to get Gary
and Ha Ha to pass through this round.]

425
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:21,910
[Big-nose goes after Bo Young again.]

426
00:28:24,290 --> 00:28:26,300
I want to get down!

427
00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:32,090
I said, I want to get down!

428
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:35,210
Bo Young!

429
00:28:36,430 --> 00:28:40,090
[Bo Young is no easy feat.]

430
00:28:40,090 --> 00:28:42,290
[Knocks Big-nose down.]

431
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:50,890
[The Boys Team is starting to lose
their ground against the Girls Team.]

432
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:57,940
[Time over]

433
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:03,560
[Ha Ha and Gary are forcibly
passed through the round.]

434
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:07,680
I can't leave the game!

435
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:10,690
- What are you doing?
- What are you guys doing?

436
00:29:10,690 --> 00:29:13,510
[That monster...]

437
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:17,770
I'm just... they're not going
to let me pass.

438
00:29:17,770 --> 00:29:22,140
[In this case... him of all people...]

439
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:25,750
[Even though they're winning,
the feeling of defeat...]

440
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:27,460
You just wait, Park Bo Young.

441
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:34,450
[But...]

442
00:29:34,450 --> 00:29:39,980
[Secret couple, Jong Suk and Ji Hyo,
are now in more danger than ever.]

443
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:46,290
[The game is coming to an end,
and they have yet to do their mission...]

444
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:51,340
[If things don't change, a real hint that
indicates to them as being the couple will...]

445
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:55,530
[Quick witted members will figure out that
these two are the couple at this rate...]

446
00:29:55,530 --> 00:29:59,590
[Secret couple,
Jong Suk and Ji Hyo in danger.]

447
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:01,940
[One vs Four.]

448
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:04,750
The boys team is in the lead.

449
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:08,170
- No, that's not the truth.
- Are you making fun of us right now?

450
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:11,240
We're going to lose this if we're
not careful.

451
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:13,530
It's going to be almost impossible
to turn this game around.

452
00:30:13,530 --> 00:30:16,010
I'm the only one left on our team,
and all four of them still have to pass.

453
00:30:16,010 --> 00:30:18,940
[Big-nose is the only person left
to pass in order for their team to win...]

454
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:20,610
That won't be too hard.

455
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:24,620
Two members will be allowed
for this round as well.

456
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:27,420
- You can be one of them.
- We win if I get up there, right?

457
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:30,400
[But why does it feel like they've
already lost the game?]

458
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:32,850
Okay!

459
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,960
There they come.
They're scary.

460
00:30:48,690 --> 00:30:51,120
[Full of desire to win.]

461
00:30:56,330 --> 00:30:58,290
[Knocked off with one shove.]

462
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:08,120
[Blank Ji and Bo Young takes that opportunity
to pull themselves up onto the platform.]

463
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:16,920
[Where are they taking him?]

464
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:18,520
- What are you guys doing?
- That's enough!

465
00:31:26,330 --> 00:31:29,950
[Big-nose ultimately is brought back
to his starting line.]

466
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:31,880
Why haven't you started yet?

467
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,170
You're the only one left to pass.

468
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:45,540
[Time over]

469
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:49,140
[Blank Ji and Bo Young
easily pass the round.]

470
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:51,820
- You have to conserve your energy.
- We're still in the lead.

471
00:31:53,010 --> 00:31:55,480
[Anyway, Blank Ji
thankfully passes the round.]

472
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:59,650
[The two are finally brought closer...]

473
00:31:59,650 --> 00:32:02,030
[The arm link mission.]

474
00:32:02,030 --> 00:32:09,650
[This is their last chance.]

475
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:14,250
- Let's just give up.
- No, you can't give up.

476
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:17,790
[But Bo Young and Sae Young are
standing between the two.]

477
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:21,050
[Blank Ji casually turns around to
move closer to Jong Suk.]

478
00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:33,060
[While everyone’s attention is focused
on the last bit of the game...]

479
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:37,460
[Oh?]

480
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:45,120
[Jong Suk pulls Ji Hyo to him.]

481
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:54,510
[Jong Suk and Ji Hyo succeeds in their
mission to link their arms together.]

482
00:32:57,450 --> 00:32:59,400
[Oh?]

483
00:32:59,410 --> 00:33:02,970
[Bo Young's gaze...]

484
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:06,300
[And Gary too?]

485
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:10,470
[Did they see?]

486
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,000
Try and come this time.

487
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:17,800
[Whew... they fortunately didn't
seem to notice.]

488
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:28,660
[While everyone's focused on
what's going on in the game...]

489
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:34,180
[This time, Ji Hyo links her arm
through Jong Suk's!]

490
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:39,190
[Heart is beating fast...]

491
00:33:45,930 --> 00:33:53,230
[Their hidden secret...
amongst these people...]

492
00:33:53,230 --> 00:33:58,650
[Jong Suk and Ji Hyo succeed
their first mission.]

493
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:04,960
[Then shall we observe Big-nose's
humiliation in peace now?]

494
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:12,550
[Big-nose shoves Jong Sook off the platform!]

495
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:16,460
[It's still anyone's game!]

496
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:26,250
[Big-nose could miraculously
win this game?]

497
00:34:30,830 --> 00:34:33,480
[Big-nose is showing off his fighting spirit.]

498
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:35,820
You have to get up there!

499
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:54,610
Pull your feet up off the ground.
That'll count as you being up there.

500
00:34:58,110 --> 00:35:00,110
[Straw platform- Game over.]

501
00:35:00,110 --> 00:35:02,090
Why did you lift one foot
off the ground?

502
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:06,440
Did you and Jong Sook kiss or something?
Why did you lift one foot off the ground?

503
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:10,300
We won!

504
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:12,040
[Rural Romance Race-
Girls Team wins the first mission.]

505
00:35:12,050 --> 00:35:13,840
They're really good at planning.

506
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:20,490
And thus, the girl team took the win
in our first physical mission.

507
00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:23,860
[Total and utter humiliation.]

508
00:35:24,430 --> 00:35:26,860
Maybe the guys were just trying to be
gentlemen, and went easy on us?

509
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:29,680
We wouldn't have been able to win
otherwise.

510
00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:32,570
You two, seriously...

511
00:35:32,570 --> 00:35:35,990
If you weren't a girl...
Let's go, just you and me.

512
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:40,310
[One on one?]

513
00:35:40,310 --> 00:35:42,010
- Lee Jong Suk and...
- What did you say?

514
00:35:42,010 --> 00:35:44,080
And Kim Jong Sook.
A one on one match between those two.

515
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:46,100
We're not going to go easy on you.

516
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:49,370
- An unexpected win...
- What do you mean, unexpected?

517
00:35:50,430 --> 00:35:52,210
You really are being too much.

518
00:35:52,210 --> 00:35:54,310
You guys are such gentlemen.

519
00:35:56,370 --> 00:35:57,870
You guys are gentlemen.

520
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:14,970
You should've been more gentle with him!

521
00:36:14,970 --> 00:36:16,580
[Samson Jong Sook.]

522
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:18,620
Gentlemen!

523
00:36:20,070 --> 00:36:22,470
- They're such gentlemen.
- Thank you.

524
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:24,620
- Thank you.
- We really are gentlemen though.

525
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:27,460
- Of course, we are.
- The Girls' Team wins.

526
00:36:28,330 --> 00:36:32,230
[The Girls' Team wins a hint about the
secret couple from having won the mission.]

527
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:38,830
[One fake and one real hint from Jong Suk
and Ji Hyo having succeeded their mission.]

528
00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:42,130
[Even though it's a relief,
she still can't help but feel nervous...]

529
00:36:42,130 --> 00:36:43,460
I'm so angry right now.

530
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:47,940
The men are looking so exhausted that I think
we need to stop for our meal before moving on.

531
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:49,580
Let's play another game before we eat!

532
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,640
- Let's show them what us girls are made of!
- Working out on an empty stomach is best!

533
00:36:59,990 --> 00:37:01,840
I'm done.
I'm done with that.

534
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:14,530
[Real hint and a fake hint.]

535
00:37:15,810 --> 00:37:18,810
<i>Rural Romance Race.
Go to the greenhouse in Namchon.

536
00:37:18,810 --> 00:37:20,690
[Next location- The greenhouse.]

537
00:37:20,690 --> 00:37:24,370
- What were the hints that we received?
- Let's look at the hints.

538
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:27,680
Were you two not going to show us
the hints if we hadn't said anything?

539
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,940
- You two are acting funny.
- No, it's not like that.

540
00:37:30,390 --> 00:37:31,860
There are two hints.

541
00:37:31,870 --> 00:37:34,940
- Mine said, 'P and K'.
- Mine says 'J'.

542
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:36,780
- P and K?
- Yes.

543
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:39,310
- Let me see.
- What could that be for?

544
00:37:40,110 --> 00:37:42,680
- PK and JK?
- No, PK and J.

545
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:47,500
- 'J' could mean Jae Suk, Jong Kook...
- Who's PK?

546
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:50,120
- 'P' would only be Bo Young.
- Who's PK?

547
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:53,910
[Confusing to figure out
which one of the two is the real hint.]

548
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:57,100
If that hint is indicating towards me,
then that's the fake hint.

549
00:37:58,050 --> 00:38:00,310
- We'll be the judge of that.
- She makes it sound simple.

550
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:07,300
[Just then, they receive a call
from Ha Ha.]

551
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:11,440
- We've figured out who the guy is.
- Just unbelievable.

552
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:14,660
<i>- We've figured out who the guy is.
- Just unbelievable.

553
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:19,950
[Did Jong Suk get found out?]

554
00:38:19,950 --> 00:38:21,930
It's Yoo Jae Suk.

555
00:38:21,930 --> 00:38:23,880
It's Yoo Jae Suk.

556
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:29,750
[The guys still believe that
Jae Suk is the culprit.]

557
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,310
<i>It's Yoo Jae Suk?

558
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:34,220
- Yoo Jae Suk is the guy, okay?
- Okay.

559
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:37,280
Take a look at all the girls' faces,
and see who looks most flustered.

560
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:41,540
I didn't know you were Jae Suk's style.

561
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:46,450
- Find out who the culprit is on your end.
- Okay, we got it.

562
00:38:46,450 --> 00:38:48,510
[If they think it's Jae Suk...
then that's a huge relief.]

563
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:51,700
[I'm doing really good at this.]

564
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:53,410
Pink is my favorite color.

565
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:57,380
What is this?

566
00:38:57,380 --> 00:39:01,160
[Which couple awaits for
Jong Suk and Ji Hyo this time?]

567
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:07,990
[Jong Suk and Ji Hyo's second mission-
Clasped hands.]

568
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:12,410
[Oh my God...]

569
00:39:13,730 --> 00:39:16,590
[One step above the linked arm mission!]

570
00:39:17,490 --> 00:39:21,860
[To have to clasp our hands together
without others seeing...]

571
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:23,580
Why am I supposed to do that?

572
00:39:28,070 --> 00:39:30,060
- This must be the place.
- Lets go inside.

573
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:31,880
- Let's just go inside.
- No reason to even hesitate about this.

574
00:39:32,290 --> 00:39:35,310
[The boys team arrives soon thereafter.]

575
00:39:43,610 --> 00:39:46,320
[Oh my... that's much harder...]

576
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,340
- Are you leaving your phone behind?
- What's with those two?

577
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:53,820
- What are you two doing?
- We're just saying 'hi'.

578
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:55,760
What are you guys doing?

579
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:57,820
Congratulations.

580
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,590
Are you two having a little lovers' chat?

581
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:05,890
[Gary seriously thinks that
these two are dating...]

582
00:40:07,050 --> 00:40:11,680
[But this is a difficult mission.
Will they be able to succeed?]

583
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:15,570
- Hurry it up!
- What took you so long?

584
00:40:15,570 --> 00:40:19,810
[These girls are quite prickly from their...
hormonal teenage years?]

585
00:40:19,810 --> 00:40:22,350
- You're not gentlemen after all.
- You guys are unbelievable.

586
00:40:22,350 --> 00:40:23,630
Look here.

587
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:25,260
You little princesses.

588
00:40:25,950 --> 00:40:29,710
Stop just calling us princesses,
and start treating us like princesses.

589
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:32,930
You guys should've gotten here faster.

590
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:35,120
[Bickering already before
the game has even begun.]

591
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:37,160
Kang Gary, you've gotten so ugly.

592
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:40,870
[Why are you saying such a thing
out of the blue?]

593
00:40:40,870 --> 00:40:44,460
Your next game has to do with
the horizontal bar that you see there.

594
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:46,560
That's why we've named this game,
The Scarecrow.

595
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,060
- What is that?
- The Scarecrow?

596
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:50,290
- Isn't she it?
- Do we have to hang from it?

597
00:40:50,290 --> 00:40:52,140
[Scarecrow doppelganger, Kwang Soo-crow.]

598
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:56,120
[It's a game that brings back
memories from their own childhood.]

599
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:58,790
[What kind of a game is that?]

600
00:40:59,950 --> 00:41:03,790
['70-'80 men who step up to
personally demonstrate the game.]

601
00:41:03,790 --> 00:41:09,950
[Win the game by avoiding the other team,
and making your way back within four moves.]

602
00:41:09,950 --> 00:41:13,040
- You have to put your arms around my leg.
- Scarecrow.

603
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:21,380
[Lovers quarrel with his ex-girlfriend,
Kwang Ja, that never seems to cease.]

604
00:41:21,390 --> 00:41:24,090
It's your own fault for confessing your love
to me when you knew I didn't love you.

605
00:41:24,090 --> 00:41:27,190
- Did you really confess your love for her?
- I'm seriously going to lose my mind.

606
00:41:27,190 --> 00:41:30,240
[Short relationship,
and a lifetime of regrets.]

607
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:33,130
- We're going to play a round as a test.
- Okay, let's go.

608
00:41:33,710 --> 00:41:36,780
[Big-nose and Sae Young to play
Rock-Paper-Scissors to see who'll go first.]

609
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:37,950
[Big-nose wins.]

610
00:41:37,950 --> 00:41:39,760
You're supposed to throw a 'Rock'
if you're a man.

611
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,540
So why did you throw a rock?

612
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:44,370
- Yeah, why did you do that?
- Are you two dating?

613
00:41:44,370 --> 00:41:46,000
You know that's not possible.

614
00:41:50,790 --> 00:41:53,260
You have to play defense.
You can block him.

615
00:41:54,950 --> 00:41:59,440
- Scarecrow!
- Okay!

616
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:01,820
[Hyuk completely blocks off a path.]

617
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:07,170
- I see your underpants!
- Stop it!

618
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:13,970
- Scare...
- You have to help us out too.

619
00:42:14,250 --> 00:42:16,390
[Why is she dangling from the bar?]

620
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:24,350
[What is this?]

621
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:27,460
Okay, fine.
We'll let you do that.

622
00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:29,860
You still have to make
three more moves, Kwang Soo.

623
00:42:29,860 --> 00:42:31,950
- What?
- You only made one of the four moves.

624
00:42:31,950 --> 00:42:33,800
I have to do all that?

625
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:37,810
[Only made one move out of the four...]

626
00:42:42,190 --> 00:42:45,150
If you oust yourself, I'm going to...

627
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:48,000
[His second move.]

628
00:42:48,010 --> 00:42:49,670
Do you think that you're
an acrobat or something?

629
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:54,290
- I'm going to get you for that.
- You've still got two moves left to make.

630
00:42:54,290 --> 00:42:56,510
Two more moves.

631
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:02,050
[He now has to remain in this position
without budging to the end.]

632
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:04,340
He has to stay in that position?

633
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:07,610
Please hurry!

634
00:43:12,430 --> 00:43:13,790
Please!

635
00:43:13,790 --> 00:43:16,710
[Ha Ha finishes surrounding Kwang Soo.]

636
00:43:22,670 --> 00:43:24,840
[Same plan as Jae Suk.
Bo Young blocks the other side.]

637
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:26,950
I think this one will be ousted soon.

638
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:32,950
[Big-nose brother's turn.]

639
00:43:40,610 --> 00:43:46,230
[Easy Brothers' Parallel Theory.]

640
00:43:48,670 --> 00:43:50,490
Why don't we just leave him
to stay in that position?

641
00:43:50,490 --> 00:43:51,950
[Easy Brothers are no threat to anyone
by being stuck in their current position.]

642
00:43:51,950 --> 00:43:54,180
Are you two playing a game,
or being punished right now?

643
00:43:54,540 --> 00:43:56,480
Okay, I'll go this time.

644
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:59,160
[Just then, Blank Ji makes her move.]

645
00:44:00,150 --> 00:44:02,460
I think his feet are too far up.

646
00:44:02,470 --> 00:44:06,060
[Should we slowly...
start to make our move?]

647
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:11,520
[Secret couple's second mission-
Clasp their hands together.]

648
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:13,980
[What is Blank Ji's plan?]

649
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:21,070
[That's our ace!
Getting as far away as she could from others.]

650
00:44:21,070 --> 00:44:22,740
[Come close to me, Jong Suk.]

651
00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:25,110
[I'll be there soon.
Wait for me!]

652
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:30,810
[Just then...
Gary makes his move over to Ji Hyo!]

653
00:44:33,430 --> 00:44:36,020
[It's too dangerous to get close
to Ji Hyo at this rate!]

654
00:44:37,070 --> 00:44:39,610
- I don't know what to do about this.
- Hurry up!

655
00:44:39,610 --> 00:44:41,800
He's stepping on the line.

656
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:43,820
Hurry up, Jong Suk!

657
00:44:48,630 --> 00:44:51,310
[Makes his move towards Ji Hyo
without any hesitation.]

658
00:44:52,650 --> 00:44:54,880
Why are we always involved
in a love triangle?

659
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:56,370
[What do I do now?]

660
00:45:01,950 --> 00:45:07,810
[Now they have to get back to the starting
line without touching their opponents.]

661
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:13,090
[Yoo Hyuk succeeds.]

662
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:27,440
[Kwang Ja is eliminated.]

663
00:45:28,130 --> 00:45:30,120
[Exhaustion hits...]

664
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:32,630
[Haroro also succeeds with ease.]

665
00:45:32,630 --> 00:45:34,970
- One to...
- It's two to zero.

666
00:45:34,970 --> 00:45:39,670
[Secret couple could've done their mission
by now if it hadn't been for Gary...]

667
00:45:43,670 --> 00:45:47,080
[While everyone's eyes and ears
are focused towards the bar...]

668
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:50,110
[But they're afraid of getting caught
with their hand clasped in each other's...]

669
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:02,280
[The game is slowly coming to an end...]

670
00:46:05,210 --> 00:46:08,170
[But to do their mission...]

671
00:46:08,170 --> 00:46:12,850
[There's just not enough time!]

672
00:46:14,610 --> 00:46:17,360
[And it's all because of this one man.]

673
00:46:17,970 --> 00:46:19,430
Okay, My turn.

674
00:46:25,730 --> 00:46:28,480
[Ji Hyo purposely jumped far out to do
her secret mission, but her plan backfired.]

675
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,530
[Having lost her chance at the secret mission,
Ji Hyo still succeeds in this public mission.]

676
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:38,440
[Ah... we were so close.]

677
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:41,220
We'll go first.

678
00:46:43,140 --> 00:46:46,330
[First round was a tie.
This round to determine the winner.]

679
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:48,740
- Should I go first?
- Okay.

680
00:46:50,550 --> 00:46:52,350
You stepped on the line.

681
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:57,410
[Blocking the immediate area
like they had done before.]

682
00:46:57,410 --> 00:47:00,570
[But it's not easy to maintain
a position like that...]

683
00:47:00,570 --> 00:47:03,990
- I bet Sae Young will do it.
- I'm going to go out this way.

684
00:47:03,990 --> 00:47:10,590
[Ha Ha makes his move to block Sae Young.]

685
00:47:15,590 --> 00:47:17,580
- We can block that area too.
- Yeah, let's block it.

686
00:47:17,580 --> 00:47:19,850
- You want me to stay close?
- Yes, don't go too far out.

687
00:47:20,870 --> 00:47:24,500
[Bo Young goes to keep the other end
blocked off for the opposing team.]

688
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:30,030
- There you go.
- I can still do it.

689
00:47:31,310 --> 00:47:35,190
[Sae Young is surrounded by Ha Ha and
Gary on either side of her.]

690
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:37,610
- Okay, next.
- Who's going next?

691
00:47:37,610 --> 00:47:40,080
Should I go next?

692
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:43,260
[We have to get it done this time!]

693
00:47:46,850 --> 00:47:49,560
[Ji Hyo once again
goes out as far as she can.]

694
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:50,810
- We have to block Ji Hyo.
- We have to block her?

695
00:47:50,810 --> 00:47:52,310
- Go block Ji Hyo.
- Go Block Ji Hyo.

696
00:47:52,690 --> 00:47:55,200
[Jong Suk steps up to be on his way.]

697
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,830
- Look at her smiling.
- She's happy that Jong Suk's coming to her.

698
00:48:00,470 --> 00:48:01,820
Don't block her off.

699
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,970
[Obvious that Jong Suk will head out
to Ji Hyo even without seeing.]

700
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:13,570
[The two are brought back together again...]

701
00:48:15,020 --> 00:48:22,250
[Clasping the hands together...
We have to succeed this time!]

702
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:26,400
[Just then, Coach Kkuk seems to be planning
something up for Kwang Ja.]

703
00:48:34,060 --> 00:48:37,070
[It's Kwang Soo heading over to block
Jong Suk this time?]

704
00:48:38,180 --> 00:48:40,540
It's over if his head even grazes Jong Suk.

705
00:48:41,090 --> 00:48:43,260
[What do we do about this now?]

706
00:48:44,070 --> 00:48:47,300
[Even Suk Jin is headed to Ji Hyo.]

707
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:49,210
[This is getting tougher and tougher...]

708
00:48:54,820 --> 00:48:58,620
[Even Jong Sook is joining their fray?]

709
00:48:58,620 --> 00:49:03,010
[Almost everyone is gathered
around Jong Suk and Ji Hyo.]

710
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:05,960
- Block Kwang Ja.
- Kwang Ja? Okay.

711
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:08,520
- Get Kwang Ja out.
- We have to oust Kwang Ja.

712
00:49:10,860 --> 00:49:13,730
[And finally, even Jae Suk
heads over to that cluster.]

713
00:49:18,650 --> 00:49:22,440
[We can't lose our last opportunity...]

714
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:24,880
- We got this.
- We're good.

715
00:49:25,100 --> 00:49:27,790
[It's time for them to start
making their way back one by one.]

716
00:49:27,790 --> 00:49:29,630
You can totally do it.

717
00:49:29,630 --> 00:49:32,430
[Sae Young tries hard to escape
her confinement]

718
00:49:32,430 --> 00:49:35,980
We just need Ji Hyo to survive.
We're even at this point.

719
00:49:35,980 --> 00:49:37,790
She just hit my hand.

720
00:49:40,050 --> 00:49:42,530
No, I was just making my move.

721
00:49:43,450 --> 00:49:46,800
[Shouting out nonsense from
having been flustered?]

722
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:48,000
It's okay.

723
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,410
[Sae Young is disqualified.]

724
00:49:54,530 --> 00:49:57,030
[Ha Ha easily makes his way back
across the finish line.]

725
00:50:01,670 --> 00:50:03,520
She's so cute when she does that.

726
00:50:03,530 --> 00:50:05,140
[Bo Young adorably succeeds.]

727
00:50:08,950 --> 00:50:13,100
[Gary also succeeds!
The little village is only left.]

728
00:50:13,100 --> 00:50:14,980
- They're in trouble.
- My turn.

729
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:19,400
[Ji Hyo attempts to extract her legs.]

730
00:50:19,410 --> 00:50:22,740
- Scarecr...
- I think she's going to do it.

731
00:50:22,740 --> 00:50:24,630
She's always good at everything.

732
00:50:24,630 --> 00:50:26,860
[Ji Hyo easily makes her way back.]

733
00:50:27,170 --> 00:50:30,690
[It is now Jong Suk's turn.
Will he be able to make his return?]

734
00:50:30,690 --> 00:50:34,960
[Pretty much impossible to extract
himself out of that position.]

735
00:50:34,970 --> 00:50:37,930
- There's no way he can get himself out.
- How is he going to be able to do that?

736
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:41,800
You keep touching our hair.

737
00:50:42,570 --> 00:50:44,670
Everything he does is ousting himself.

738
00:50:44,670 --> 00:50:47,420
- Jong Suk just threw himself in my arms.
- Eliminated!

739
00:50:47,430 --> 00:50:48,030
[Lee Jong Suk is eliminated.]

740
00:50:48,930 --> 00:50:50,610
Our plan succeeded.

741
00:50:50,610 --> 00:50:54,940
[Thus Jong Suk makes his way back to Ji Hyo.]

742
00:50:54,940 --> 00:50:56,490
[Good job, Jong Suk.]

743
00:50:56,490 --> 00:50:57,740
We just need to oust Kwang Ja, and we'll win.

744
00:50:57,750 --> 00:51:00,530
[It's still a battlefield over here.]

745
00:51:00,530 --> 00:51:03,350
- Okay, here we go.
- I can see the touching.

746
00:51:03,350 --> 00:51:05,220
[How is he supposed to
get himself out of there?]

747
00:51:06,590 --> 00:51:09,390
[Giraffe's back kick.]

748
00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:13,520
Is he allowed to do that?

749
00:51:15,150 --> 00:51:17,190
- I'm fine.
- I'm so sorry.

750
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:21,910
[Kwang Ja is eliminated after
kicking her ex-boyfriend in the face.]

751
00:51:21,910 --> 00:51:25,150
- Take big leaps.
- Scarecr...

752
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:27,230
- Ow.
- Crow.

753
00:51:27,260 --> 00:51:29,920
[The game is starting to come to an end...]

754
00:51:30,690 --> 00:51:33,770
[Ji Hyo sticks herself close to Jong Suk
while pretending to avoid Suk Jin.]

755
00:51:40,210 --> 00:51:42,110
- We won.
- We won this game.

756
00:51:42,110 --> 00:51:45,750
[Everyone else's attention is elsewhere...]

757
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:51,550
[Now is the time.]

758
00:51:51,550 --> 00:51:55,910
[Jong Suk pulls his hands out
of his pockets.]

759
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:16,670
[Secret couple's second mission-
Succeeds in clasping their hands together.]

760
00:52:16,670 --> 00:52:19,500
[No one seems to notice what
the secret couple so doing.]

761
00:52:20,070 --> 00:52:22,940
[Why is it suddenly so cold?]

762
00:52:29,490 --> 00:52:32,880
[Casually pretending to whisper something
to him after they succeed their mission.]

763
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:37,700
[Secret couple Jong Suk and Ji Hyo-
Succeeds their second mission.]

764
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:42,880
[Jae Suk safely makes it back
across the finish line.]

765
00:52:44,260 --> 00:52:48,530
[Scarecrow game-
The boys team wins by 4:3.]

766
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:55,840
- We easily won that game.
- It's all because of Kwang Ja blocking me.

767
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:58,310
We still have to remember that there's
a secret couple amongst us through all this.

768
00:52:58,310 --> 00:53:01,550
- Yeah, we have to remember.
- Jong Suk is acting really suspicious.

769
00:53:02,740 --> 00:53:04,810
- Jong Suk doesn't look too happy.
- My legs are asleep.

770
00:53:04,810 --> 00:53:06,900
I saw you standing next to Kwang Soo.

771
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:09,730
- What were you two talking about?
- I don't know, but it's weird.

772
00:53:13,570 --> 00:53:17,170
[One real and one fake hint from
having won this mission.]

773
00:53:17,170 --> 00:53:19,030
- Can we look at it right now?
- What is this?

774
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:22,050
We still have more games left to play.

775
00:53:27,140 --> 00:53:30,980
[Unsure of what their hint is saying
since only one of them is the real hint.]

776
00:53:30,990 --> 00:53:34,010
- Okay, let's go!
- We need to figure this out.

777
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:40,480
[Whew... we succeeded.]

778
00:53:44,980 --> 00:53:50,370
[Real hint and fake hint.]

779
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,220
<i>Do you remember what
their hint was?

780
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:56,220
Could it be Jae Suk?

781
00:53:56,220 --> 00:53:58,690
I told you that it isn't me.

782
00:54:00,130 --> 00:54:03,080
- How frustrating. I told you it's not me.
- I'm positive that it's Jae Suk.

783
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:05,910
[Everyone's hunch of it being Jae Suk
is becoming even more resolute.]

784
00:54:05,910 --> 00:54:09,320
- What?
- I really do think that it is Jae Suk.

785
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:13,020
- You guys are driving me crazy.
- I think it is you too.

786
00:54:13,020 --> 00:54:16,930
I'm telling you that it isn't me.
It's someone else in this car.

787
00:54:18,410 --> 00:54:21,210
I don't know which one of you it is, but
whomever it is, you're a really good actor.

788
00:54:21,210 --> 00:54:23,870
I think that it could be Ji Hyo.

789
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:26,460
Yeah, it's me.

790
00:54:26,460 --> 00:54:28,930
- I think it's Ji Hyo.
- That's right, it's me.

791
00:54:28,930 --> 00:54:30,910
I think more than likely,
it's Sae Young.

792
00:54:30,910 --> 00:54:34,070
- Why do you think that it's me?
- Who is it that you're dating?

793
00:54:34,940 --> 00:54:38,130
I really hope that it's Jong Suk.

794
00:54:38,130 --> 00:54:41,580
- You and Jong Suk?
- No, I mean any one of us...

795
00:54:51,610 --> 00:54:54,910
[Arrives at their next location-
The public market.]

796
00:54:56,040 --> 00:54:59,580
[What is their next secret mission to be?]

797
00:54:59,580 --> 00:55:00,930
Here?

798
00:55:05,140 --> 00:55:09,210
[Third secret couple mission-
Forehead to forehead kiss.]

799
00:55:10,950 --> 00:55:15,890
[An extremely obvious move that cannot be
compared to the previous two missions.]

800
00:55:17,130 --> 00:55:20,010
[How are we supposed to do that?]

801
00:55:22,890 --> 00:55:24,590
Are we going to have to go out
and buy something again?

802
00:55:25,850 --> 00:55:28,240
[It seems like a shopping mission
of some sort?]

803
00:55:28,660 --> 00:55:32,870
I may not know much...
but I do know that Jae Suk is it.

804
00:55:32,870 --> 00:55:35,950
The funny thing is that he's standing there
looking so shameless as he is right now.

805
00:55:37,530 --> 00:55:40,650
- He's acting like it isn't him.
- That's because it isn't me.

806
00:55:40,650 --> 00:55:43,770
- Look at me. It really isn't you?
- No, it's not me.

807
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:48,940
- Then who is it? Is it you?
- No, it's not me.

808
00:55:48,940 --> 00:55:50,270
Jong Suk?

809
00:55:50,270 --> 00:55:52,470
- You're acting weird.
- You're suddenly acting weird.

810
00:55:52,470 --> 00:55:54,580
Don't do anything suspicious.

811
00:55:55,330 --> 00:55:57,400
- Don't do anything.
- You said you don't know?

812
00:55:57,400 --> 00:56:00,540
- No, don't do anything.
- What do you mean, don't do anything?

813
00:56:01,630 --> 00:56:03,220
Why is your face getting so red
all of a sudden?

814
00:56:03,220 --> 00:56:06,480
No, it's just that I have a phobia
of being in the spotlight.

815
00:56:07,430 --> 00:56:10,080
[Such a phobia even exists?]

816
00:56:10,910 --> 00:56:13,660
[The girls team finally arrives.]

817
00:56:14,870 --> 00:56:19,800
[Time to show Ji Hyo what her next
secret mission is.]

818
00:56:23,270 --> 00:56:26,900
[Third secret couple mission-
Forehead to forehead kiss.]

819
00:56:28,110 --> 00:56:30,790
What are you doing?

820
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:41,540
[Miss Capable Jong Sook...
She noticed their move?]

821
00:56:41,540 --> 00:56:43,150
Long time no see.

822
00:56:44,540 --> 00:56:47,750
[He mistakes what they did
as just a way of greeting each other.]

823
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:53,790
[That's a relief, but...]

824
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:57,670
Nobody do anything suspicious.

825
00:56:57,670 --> 00:56:59,700
[In here?]

826
00:56:59,700 --> 00:57:01,940
[We have to do the forehead kiss
in this tiny enclosed space?]

827
00:57:01,940 --> 00:57:04,080
[We can do it, right?]

828
00:57:04,090 --> 00:57:05,910
Have you made any guesses as to who
the girl is on your drive over here?

829
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:08,300
- Yes, we have an idea.
- You guys had better watch out.

830
00:57:08,580 --> 00:57:13,650
[They're done with their deduction?
They seem to be confident in their guess.]

831
00:57:13,650 --> 00:57:15,880
We're nearing the end of this mission.

832
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:17,620
I'm sure you guys must be nervous.

833
00:57:17,620 --> 00:57:23,220
<i>[If you succeed the mission within your time
limit with a partner, then you'll win a hint.]

834
00:57:23,220 --> 00:57:26,930
Each of the men will now grab a shopping bag,
and the money you need for shopping.

835
00:57:28,220 --> 00:57:30,590
[Kwang Ja reaches for a bag
without even a moment's hesitation.]

836
00:57:33,570 --> 00:57:36,870
[Kwang Ja is confused about
her own identity.]

837
00:57:36,870 --> 00:57:43,250
The men will now choose a girl whom they'd
like to be partnered up with to go shopping.

838
00:57:43,250 --> 00:57:45,700
- Okay.
- Point to the girl you want as your partner

839
00:57:45,700 --> 00:57:47,860
and tell that girl to 'Come out'.

840
00:57:47,860 --> 00:57:52,890
And if the woman is happy with the partner,
then she only needs to grab his hand.

841
00:57:52,900 --> 00:57:54,330
[The girl to grab the boy's hand if
they're happy with the partner.]

842
00:57:54,330 --> 00:57:56,720
- Ji Suk Jin will start.
- Okay, I'll start.

843
00:57:56,720 --> 00:57:58,800
This is making me feel so shy!

844
00:58:01,170 --> 00:58:03,220
What if all the boys come after me?

845
00:58:03,220 --> 00:58:05,530
[What a fanciful dream that is...]

846
00:58:05,540 --> 00:58:06,980
Don't avoid my gaze.

847
00:58:06,980 --> 00:58:08,710
Why are you trying to avoid
meeting my gaze?

848
00:58:08,710 --> 00:58:11,670
[Who's the girl that Suk Jin
wants as his partner?]

849
00:58:12,500 --> 00:58:14,720
Come out!

850
00:58:16,420 --> 00:58:17,800
No thanks.

851
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:19,500
No thanks.

852
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:27,640
Jong Suk and I are all set then.

853
00:58:28,690 --> 00:58:31,150
[Okay, we'll get coupled off first...]

854
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:33,970
[Then maybe things will be
pretty simple after that.]

855
00:58:33,970 --> 00:58:36,810
- Jong Suk and I are all set.
- I have my insurance too.

856
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:39,070
You can't call her your insurance.

857
00:58:39,070 --> 00:58:41,520
You're going to make her mad by
referring to her as your insurance.

858
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:44,170
- You think of me as your insurance?
- Why would you say that?

859
00:58:45,060 --> 00:58:46,730
Come out.

860
00:58:46,730 --> 00:58:48,370
Come out.

861
00:58:48,570 --> 00:58:50,840
[Nice!]

862
00:58:51,350 --> 00:58:53,360
[His face turns beet red.]

863
00:58:53,360 --> 00:58:56,090
You don't even need to say anything.
Just grab his hand if you want to.

864
00:58:56,090 --> 00:58:57,650
Yes, I want to.

865
00:59:00,700 --> 00:59:02,000
[Nice!]

866
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,530
[We succeeded in getting partnered up.]

867
00:59:07,180 --> 00:59:10,890
[Insurance is gone?
Gary loses it.]

868
00:59:10,890 --> 00:59:13,440
You called me your insurance.
You only think of me as your insurance.

869
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:16,000
- I meant that I'm your insurance.
- Don't make me laugh.

870
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,820
- What are you even thinking?
- I'm sorry to say this...

871
00:59:19,850 --> 00:59:22,720
but you two need to butt out.

872
00:59:22,940 --> 00:59:25,360
- You can't get jealous, okay?
- Of course not.

873
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:27,530
Come out.

874
00:59:29,590 --> 00:59:32,260
[Jae Suk confidently points to Bo Young.]

875
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:37,120
What are you saying is different
between him and I?

876
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:41,320
I just didn't want to take the first person
that chose me. I was going for the second.

877
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:43,180
[She just didn't want to say 'yes'
to the first person who chose her.]

878
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:45,330
Come out.

879
00:59:46,620 --> 00:59:47,930
Forget it.

880
00:59:54,060 --> 00:59:56,750
- Cute little kiddo... come out.
- Forget it.

881
00:59:57,540 --> 01:00:00,340
[An immediate refusal.]

882
01:00:01,390 --> 01:00:04,120
[Then which of the male member
it is that she's waiting for?]

883
01:00:04,120 --> 01:00:05,590
You just wait.

884
01:00:05,590 --> 01:00:07,710
Come out, Sae Young.

885
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:12,590
- Okay.
- Okay!

886
01:00:13,250 --> 01:00:16,330
[Did she really say that?
She chose Suk Jin as her partner?]

887
01:00:16,750 --> 01:00:19,950
It's because he's always getting
scorned and turned down by everyone.

888
01:00:22,080 --> 01:00:25,630
[The only ones left remaining are...
Kwang Ja and Jong Sook.]

889
01:00:25,630 --> 01:00:27,590
I want both of you to point to the girl
you want simultaneously.

890
01:00:27,590 --> 01:00:30,250
- This is driving me crazy.
- I don't even know who to choose here.

891
01:00:30,250 --> 01:00:31,960
They each have their own
attractive elements about them.

892
01:00:32,290 --> 01:00:34,710
[Ah... really?]

893
01:00:35,710 --> 01:00:38,170
This one's cute, and this one's sexy.

894
01:00:39,510 --> 01:00:41,800
You guys are going to make me
lose my mind.

895
01:00:42,360 --> 01:00:44,130
- At the same time.
- At the same time?

896
01:00:44,130 --> 01:00:47,610
[This situation is making them
hesitate in their decision?]

897
01:00:47,610 --> 01:00:50,490
- Let's hurry. We need to go shopping.
- I'm so nervous.

898
01:00:52,420 --> 01:00:54,720
One, two, three.

899
01:00:57,770 --> 01:00:59,410
- Come out.
- Come out.

900
01:01:00,210 --> 01:01:02,880
[Ha Ha and Gary both chooses Kwang Ja.]

901
01:01:07,420 --> 01:01:09,300
[What do I do?]

902
01:01:09,300 --> 01:01:12,600
- I need Kwang Ja in my life.
- No one else will do for me.

903
01:01:15,720 --> 01:01:17,780
It's because I like girls who are cute.

904
01:01:17,780 --> 01:01:21,230
If you treat me like this,
you're going to regret it down the road.

905
01:01:21,230 --> 01:01:24,160
- Can't I even love whomever I want?
- What do you mean by that?

906
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:25,930
Kwang Ja has to make a decision.

907
01:01:25,930 --> 01:01:28,370
[Ha Ha and Gary are doing whatever they
can to win Kwang Ja's affection.]

908
01:01:28,760 --> 01:01:30,830
- One...
- How about I hug them from behind?

909
01:01:32,250 --> 01:01:35,290
[Kwang Ja is really milking the situation.]

910
01:01:35,290 --> 01:01:37,000
I'll hug one and
Jong Kook will hug the other.]

911
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:40,590
[Two nervous male students.]

912
01:01:43,210 --> 01:01:46,480
[Kwang Ja behind one,
and Jong Sook behind the other.]

913
01:01:47,380 --> 01:01:50,260
[Who will Kwang Ja choose?]

914
01:01:52,910 --> 01:01:57,640
- One, two...
- Wait, why am I feeling so nervous?

915
01:01:57,640 --> 01:02:00,290
One, two, three!

916
01:02:10,180 --> 01:02:11,840
Wouldn't it have been nicer if
you had chosen me from the beginning?

917
01:02:11,840 --> 01:02:14,160
Teach him what hell is like, Jong Sook.

918
01:02:14,650 --> 01:02:17,210
Seriously, Jong Sook.
Show him what hell is like.

919
01:02:18,550 --> 01:02:20,470
Everyone's partnered up now.

920
01:02:20,470 --> 01:02:23,460
You just need to go out
and buy anything that you'd like.

921
01:02:23,460 --> 01:02:25,700
You can go out and
buy anything that you'd like, but...

922
01:02:25,700 --> 01:02:27,290
You don't know what this is...

923
01:02:27,290 --> 01:02:31,880
But you have to complete whichever mission
you are given within three minutes

924
01:02:31,880 --> 01:02:33,990
which includes your shopping time.

925
01:02:35,830 --> 01:02:40,340
[Off to the market for now
to buy the stuff that they need.]

926
01:02:40,340 --> 01:02:43,060
[They must return within three minutes!]

927
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:55,030
[A market with countless number
of goodies to buy...]

928
01:02:55,030 --> 01:02:58,290
[What will they bring back?]

929
01:02:58,290 --> 01:03:00,700
- What about the dried persimmon?
- That's what we wanted to get.

930
01:03:00,700 --> 01:03:03,730
[Unsure of what to buy since they
don't know what the mission is.]

931
01:03:03,730 --> 01:03:05,900
- You want to buy clementines?
- Yes, I think clementines would be best.

932
01:03:05,900 --> 01:03:08,000
You're thinking clementines?
Okay, let's buy clementines.

933
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:09,480
[Suk Jin and Sae Young buy clementines.]

934
01:03:09,490 --> 01:03:11,100
Something like this?

935
01:03:11,100 --> 01:03:13,310
How about some rice?
Want to buy rice?

936
01:03:14,360 --> 01:03:16,000
- How about tofu?
- Okay, tofu.

937
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,580
Can you give us a piece of the tofu?

938
01:03:19,220 --> 01:03:21,570
[Kwang Soo and Gary buy a piece of tofu.]

939
01:03:24,230 --> 01:03:28,120
[Another team has already
bought the clementines...]

940
01:03:28,120 --> 01:03:29,780
How about this?
Dried persimmons.

941
01:03:29,780 --> 01:03:31,940
[Jong Kook and Ha Ha buy dried persimmons.]

942
01:03:31,940 --> 01:03:34,410
- Here's 5,000 won.
- Thank you.

943
01:03:35,080 --> 01:03:38,040
- Want to buy the mackerel?
- Did you see the mission?

944
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:40,510
- Did you see the mission?
- Yeah, the forehead kiss.

945
01:03:41,880 --> 01:03:44,600
[Third secret couple mission-
Forehead kiss.]

946
01:03:45,090 --> 01:03:47,520
- It's a forehead to forehead to kiss.
- We have to touch our foreheads together?

947
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:50,160
Let's buy something first.
How about jujubes?

948
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:53,540
- How about the anchovies?
- How much are the jujubes?

949
01:03:53,540 --> 01:03:55,850
[Trying to buy what they need
to do their mission first...]

950
01:03:55,850 --> 01:03:58,450
- How much is this?
- 5,000 won.

951
01:03:59,090 --> 01:04:00,380
What is that?

952
01:04:00,380 --> 01:04:03,100
[Ji Hyo sees Jae Suk and Bo Young
passing them by.]

953
01:04:03,660 --> 01:04:06,100
Just buy whatever.
Let's touch our foreheads together now.

954
01:04:06,100 --> 01:04:08,890
[What?
They're going to do it right here?]

955
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:14,260
[With no one else around...
with the added thrill and excitement.]

956
01:04:17,390 --> 01:04:21,380
[Almost there!]

957
01:04:23,540 --> 01:04:26,050
[Jae Suk couple suddenly turns and
heads back towards Jong Suk and Ji Hyo.]

958
01:04:29,310 --> 01:04:32,550
[Rushing to buy their merchandise
when they hear someone coming close by.]

959
01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:40,610
Hey, let's go get the clementines!

960
01:04:40,610 --> 01:04:45,570
[The forehead kiss...
Did they just fail their first attempt?]

961
01:04:46,740 --> 01:04:49,620
[Ji Hyo and Jong Suk are first to get back.]

962
01:04:49,620 --> 01:04:51,490
Right here.

963
01:04:51,490 --> 01:04:54,560
[Kwang Ja and Gary arrive soon thereafter.]

964
01:04:59,060 --> 01:05:01,430
Don't let go of each other's hands.
Two minutes have passed.

965
01:05:01,430 --> 01:05:04,180
- Everyone back?
- Yes, we're all here.

966
01:05:04,190 --> 01:05:06,200
[Everyone is back on set.]

967
01:05:06,200 --> 01:05:07,660
Look at the mission that you've chosen.

968
01:05:07,660 --> 01:05:10,220
[The mission they need to do
with the purchase they made is...]

969
01:05:12,280 --> 01:05:15,640
[Pile the items that you bought
in a tower within a minute.]

970
01:05:17,430 --> 01:05:20,190
- We all bought the same thing?
- Let's use the tofu first.

971
01:05:20,190 --> 01:05:22,760
Why did you buy clementines?

972
01:05:22,760 --> 01:05:26,090
- Look at how nice this tofu is.
- Can we stack it like this?

973
01:05:26,090 --> 01:05:29,060
- How do you want us to stack these?
- Just stack them.

974
01:05:29,060 --> 01:05:32,580
[They have to stack all the odds and ends
that they bought and brought back?]

975
01:05:35,980 --> 01:05:37,970
- Stack them up together.
- Just start stacking them.

976
01:05:40,170 --> 01:05:42,190
- Stack them like this.
- I have dried persimmons.

977
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:44,810
[The time is ticking, and
there are so many things to stack!]

978
01:05:45,670 --> 01:05:47,760
- Put it on the bottom.
- More clementines.

979
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:49,790
You've got ten seconds left.

980
01:05:49,790 --> 01:05:53,890
- Okay, I think we got it.
- Oh no!

981
01:05:56,630 --> 01:05:58,480
[Time over]

982
01:06:03,510 --> 01:06:06,610
[Unfortunately fails the mission
because of one little clementine.]

983
01:06:06,610 --> 01:06:09,880
- We never should've ripped the bag.
- Who opened up the bag of clementines?

984
01:06:09,880 --> 01:06:13,010
- Why did you rip the bag open?
- No, it's okay.

985
01:06:13,010 --> 01:06:16,130
It's really good though.

986
01:06:16,130 --> 01:06:19,020
[Time for a little snack break.]

987
01:06:19,020 --> 01:06:21,680
But this was a much easier mission
than I had expected it to be.

988
01:06:21,680 --> 01:06:24,700
- Yeah, it was a pretty simple mission.
- We could've succeeded it.

989
01:06:24,710 --> 01:06:28,220
We could've succeeded it if we had
just a little bit more time.

990
01:06:28,220 --> 01:06:29,690
We could've done it if Suk Jin
hadn't ripped the bag open.

991
01:06:29,690 --> 01:06:33,110
But is the secret couple trying to get in
the way of us succeeding the missions?

992
01:06:33,110 --> 01:06:35,670
- Why would they do that?
- To prevent us from getting the hint.

993
01:06:35,670 --> 01:06:38,050
- You think?
- How is it you know all that so well?

994
01:06:38,050 --> 01:06:41,040
- That means you're the girl!
- I was the first one to get back here.

995
01:06:41,040 --> 01:06:43,880
- Your face looks like you're lying.
- Each partner...

996
01:06:45,350 --> 01:06:48,210
[These two are acting like
they're suspicious of others.]

997
01:06:48,210 --> 01:06:50,410
- Really?
- One girl and one guy.

998
01:06:50,410 --> 01:06:52,180
The culprits are in this room.

999
01:06:52,180 --> 01:06:55,680
[Then where else would they be?]

1000
01:06:59,550 --> 01:07:01,920
- Do we go with the same partner?
- Let's just keep the same partner.

1001
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:03,470
I like my partner.

1002
01:07:03,470 --> 01:07:06,810
But if we keep the same partner,
it'll be hard for us to figure out who it is.

1003
01:07:06,810 --> 01:07:10,050
- If we keep the same partner...
- Then let's change partners.

1004
01:07:10,050 --> 01:07:11,640
Okay, fine.

1005
01:07:12,070 --> 01:07:16,690
[Is Blank Ji trying to avoid suspicion,
or is she...]

1006
01:07:18,220 --> 01:07:21,820
- The girls will choose the partner this time.
- Okay.

1007
01:07:21,820 --> 01:07:23,270
[The girl's turn to choose the partner.]

1008
01:07:24,350 --> 01:07:26,460
[Miss Capable, Jong Sook,
to choose the first partner.]

1009
01:07:31,110 --> 01:07:32,520
Let's go together.

1010
01:07:34,030 --> 01:07:35,560
Are you kidding me?
Get lost.

1011
01:07:36,500 --> 01:07:38,960
[Immediately cuts him off.]

1012
01:07:46,180 --> 01:07:49,010
[Physically strong girl student
is turned down from her selection.]

1013
01:07:49,700 --> 01:07:51,410
What do you think you're doing?

1014
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:54,310
[You just wait and see...]

1015
01:07:57,650 --> 01:07:59,210
You'd better make the right choice.

1016
01:07:59,940 --> 01:08:02,230
[Jong Suk breaking out into a dance
to get her to choose him?]

1017
01:08:06,550 --> 01:08:08,420
Come out.

1018
01:08:08,420 --> 01:08:10,550
[Chooses Jong Suk as expected.]

1019
01:08:11,830 --> 01:08:13,870
She meant you.

1020
01:08:13,870 --> 01:08:16,110
Lee Jong Suk's mine!

1021
01:08:16,110 --> 01:08:17,140
Sorry to ask this,
but can you all leave Jae Suk?

1022
01:08:17,140 --> 01:08:19,480
Okay, we won't choose him.

1023
01:08:19,480 --> 01:08:22,510
- Come on, Bo Young.
- Choose me.

1024
01:08:22,510 --> 01:08:26,290
- You hurt my feelings earlier.
- You and I are a perfect match.

1025
01:08:26,300 --> 01:08:27,660
[Haroro is offering
his similar height to her?]

1026
01:08:30,980 --> 01:08:33,180
- We worked really well together earlier.
- Don't think of doing anything foolish.

1027
01:08:33,960 --> 01:08:35,230
Let's go!

1028
01:08:36,840 --> 01:08:39,870
[Ji Hyo's their last hope.]

1029
01:08:39,870 --> 01:08:41,690
He's my living hell, Ji Hyo.

1030
01:08:42,680 --> 01:08:45,680
[The two grim reapers.]

1031
01:08:45,680 --> 01:08:47,950
- Ji Hyo.
- Come on, Ji Hyo.

1032
01:08:47,950 --> 01:08:49,610
- Here, Ji Hyo.
- Are you mad?

1033
01:08:50,700 --> 01:08:52,750
- Are you mad?
- What are you doing?

1034
01:08:52,750 --> 01:08:54,770
[Chooses her Monday boyfriend, Gary.]

1035
01:08:54,800 --> 01:08:59,100
- Why would I be mad?
- Don't you even have any self-respect?

1036
01:09:00,140 --> 01:09:03,030
[The Monday couple is back together again.]

1037
01:09:03,030 --> 01:09:04,720
It's our turn now, right?

1038
01:09:08,210 --> 01:09:11,950
- They're our ghosts.
- The two worst nightmares.

1039
01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:16,110
Hey, give me my chance to get revenge.

1040
01:09:17,320 --> 01:09:19,200
Aren't we free to choose
whom we love?

1041
01:09:20,870 --> 01:09:23,490
Even though we're both girls,
and friends...

1042
01:09:23,490 --> 01:09:27,120
- One, two, three.
- You.

1043
01:09:29,480 --> 01:09:31,540
[Jae Suk chooses Kwang Ja without
even a moment's hesitation.]

1044
01:09:32,330 --> 01:09:34,880
[Jong Sook is refused for the second time.]

1045
01:09:35,130 --> 01:09:37,230
He's about to explode.

1046
01:09:40,190 --> 01:09:42,550
[Totally at a loss for words.]

1047
01:09:43,380 --> 01:09:45,770
[The two must stick together
no matter what happens now.]

1048
01:09:45,770 --> 01:09:48,890
Those two are really suspicious.
Don't you think?

1049
01:09:48,890 --> 01:09:50,020
Yes, I agree.

1050
01:09:50,020 --> 01:09:54,640
[Jae Suk and Kwang Ja are suddenly
receiving everyone's suspicions.]

1051
01:09:54,640 --> 01:09:57,600
The way I see it,
those two are the real couple.

1052
01:09:57,610 --> 01:09:59,570
I bet it's those two.

1053
01:09:59,570 --> 01:10:01,250
Just wait until I get my hands
on you two.

1054
01:10:04,220 --> 01:10:07,400
[Okay... things are going well.]

1055
01:10:08,720 --> 01:10:10,580
- You have to be back within three minutes.
- Okay.

1056
01:10:10,580 --> 01:10:12,570
[Off to complete their shopping
within three minutes.]

1057
01:10:12,570 --> 01:10:14,160
We just buy whatever we want again?

1058
01:10:15,990 --> 01:10:19,520
[Out with your partner with
your hands held tight!]

1059
01:10:23,190 --> 01:10:25,440
Are you a part of a secret couple?

1060
01:10:25,440 --> 01:10:28,300
[Sae Young bluntly asks
Jong Suk the question.]

1061
01:10:29,180 --> 01:10:31,020
What do you mean, a couple?

1062
01:10:34,310 --> 01:10:35,570
No, I'm not.

1063
01:10:37,550 --> 01:10:41,080
[They're all starting to seriously
suspect one another.]

1064
01:10:41,080 --> 01:10:43,420
- I think the real couple is together now.
- I think so too.

1065
01:10:43,420 --> 01:10:46,240
- I feel suspicious of Kwang Soo.
- Me too.

1066
01:10:46,240 --> 01:10:51,450
I think the real couple is together right now
and planning something.

1067
01:10:51,450 --> 01:10:53,010
[Big-nose's sharp deductions.]

1068
01:10:53,010 --> 01:10:57,190
- We want to buy a pair of shoes.
- We'd like a buy a pair of shoes.

1069
01:10:57,190 --> 01:10:58,750
[Jae Suk and Kwang Ja wants to buy
a pair of shoes.]

1070
01:10:59,720 --> 01:11:01,530
How about a pair of slippers?

1071
01:11:01,530 --> 01:11:03,860
12,000 won?
The furry ones are pretty.

1072
01:11:04,450 --> 01:11:07,060
Here's 12,000 won.
Thank you! Good luck!

1073
01:11:07,060 --> 01:11:09,630
Okay, let's get going.

1074
01:11:09,970 --> 01:11:14,200
[Suk Jin and Jong Sook are busy tailing
their suspects, Jae Suk and Kwang Ja.]

1075
01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:16,500
What are you two planning?

1076
01:11:16,500 --> 01:11:18,460
- It's not you, is it, Bo Young?
- No, it's not.

1077
01:11:18,460 --> 01:11:21,620
- I think it may be Sae Young.
- But I'm suspicious of you too.

1078
01:11:21,620 --> 01:11:23,860
It really isn't me.

1079
01:11:24,340 --> 01:11:27,190
- I think it's Sae Young.
- I think it's you.

1080
01:11:27,190 --> 01:11:28,850
[Everyone's starting to suspect one another.]

1081
01:11:29,880 --> 01:11:32,390
[All the pairs are starting to make their
way back with their purchased items.]

1082
01:11:33,850 --> 01:11:36,380
[Ji Hyo and Gary brings back
a bag of red beans.]

1083
01:11:36,900 --> 01:11:41,400
[Stand still with all the items purchased held
between you and your partner's body.]

1084
01:11:41,400 --> 01:11:43,460
You're not talking about just
one bean, right?

1085
01:11:43,460 --> 01:11:44,640
Yes, just one bean.

1086
01:11:47,030 --> 01:11:49,120
Look at how happy Gary is.

1087
01:11:49,130 --> 01:11:51,480
Just one bean?

1088
01:11:51,480 --> 01:11:54,600
[Keep the item held by your cheeks with your
partner for one full minute.]

1089
01:11:54,600 --> 01:11:56,780
[Even the shoes?]

1090
01:11:57,890 --> 01:11:59,860
- Together?
- Yes, but we haven't started it yet.

1091
01:11:59,860 --> 01:12:02,450
Was this game created specifically
for Gary and Ji Hyo?

1092
01:12:02,450 --> 01:12:05,120
- You'd better not drop it.
- There's no way that we can drop this.

1093
01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:06,920
[Still remaining suspicious of one another
even as they stand there cheek to cheek.]

1094
01:12:09,040 --> 01:12:11,740
[Totally stuck together.]

1095
01:12:12,860 --> 01:12:14,670
[Start]

1096
01:12:15,660 --> 01:12:18,910
- Be careful.
- You're the one acting suspicious.

1097
01:12:19,930 --> 01:12:22,270
- You're acting really strange.
- I feel like it's slipping.

1098
01:12:26,370 --> 01:12:29,100
- You can't drop it.
- Dropping it would be suspicious.

1099
01:12:29,100 --> 01:12:33,050
[Will become subjects of a lot of suspicion
if they were to fail this mission.]

1100
01:12:33,060 --> 01:12:35,830
You'd be more than just suspected.

1101
01:12:36,450 --> 01:12:38,520
Let's go for five minutes of this.

1102
01:12:39,910 --> 01:12:41,360
Come on, Jong Suk.

1103
01:12:41,780 --> 01:12:43,950
[Everyone's doing a good job
of maintaining their stance...]

1104
01:12:44,660 --> 01:12:48,870
[15 seconds left to go.]

1105
01:12:52,680 --> 01:12:54,600
- Seven...
- I bet the couple is sweating bullets.

1106
01:12:55,960 --> 01:12:59,370
[Only five seconds left to go!]

1107
01:13:03,640 --> 01:13:05,750
[Pass]

1108
01:13:08,920 --> 01:13:10,780
He won't go away!

1109
01:13:13,650 --> 01:13:15,820
Are we going to keep going
with the same partner?

1110
01:13:15,820 --> 01:13:18,030
My partner and I are going to stay together.

1111
01:13:18,030 --> 01:13:20,930
- Shall we swap partners?
- I guess you're all done with scheming?

1112
01:13:20,940 --> 01:13:23,730
What are you talking about?
What scheming are you talking about?

1113
01:13:23,730 --> 01:13:25,660
[Did he catch on to the fact that there
are secret couple missions?]

1114
01:13:25,950 --> 01:13:27,220
It's not me.

1115
01:13:27,220 --> 01:13:29,030
- You two are caught.
- It's not me.

1116
01:13:31,110 --> 01:13:32,550
- Is Ji Suk Jin going to start again?
- Yes.

1117
01:13:34,400 --> 01:13:36,000
You can't hit anyone, Jong Sook.

1118
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:40,120
- You can't hit anyone on a TV show.
- They're fighting over Yoo Jae Suk right now.

1119
01:13:41,730 --> 01:13:43,270
I'm seriously going to lose my mind.

1120
01:13:44,310 --> 01:13:47,470
[Fighting over their love for Jae Suk?]

1121
01:13:47,950 --> 01:13:51,520
And Jong Sook keeps threatening us
not to touch Jae Suk.

1122
01:13:51,520 --> 01:13:54,780
- I'm really going to lose my mind.
- I'm going to drive you crazy.

1123
01:13:56,520 --> 01:13:57,710
Shall I get started?

1124
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:03,290
[Suk Jin, Bo Young and Gary, Ji Hyo
are already partnered up together...]

1125
01:14:03,290 --> 01:14:05,930
[Jong Suk and Sae Young are
partnered up together again.]

1126
01:14:05,930 --> 01:14:08,000
- I'm going to lose it.
- I'm going to lose it again.

1127
01:14:08,640 --> 01:14:10,760
Can you get out of the way, Jong Suk?

1128
01:14:10,770 --> 01:14:14,790
[Frightening moment in time...]

1129
01:14:16,410 --> 01:14:19,180
- It's our time.
- You'd better listen to me this time.

1130
01:14:20,420 --> 01:14:22,060
Ha Ha is to make his choice, right?

1131
01:14:23,340 --> 01:14:25,810
It's my turn to pick?
That's simple.

1132
01:14:30,650 --> 01:14:31,900
Okay, fine.

1133
01:14:33,110 --> 01:14:34,380
Come here.

1134
01:14:36,970 --> 01:14:38,480
Come here, and carry the bag.

1135
01:14:39,290 --> 01:14:40,900
I said, pick up the bag.

1136
01:14:40,910 --> 01:14:42,680
Pick up and carry the bag.

1137
01:14:47,130 --> 01:14:49,270
- Hold my hand.
- I'm going to lose it.

1138
01:14:49,270 --> 01:14:51,750
- Should I give you five minutes?
- I'm going to lose my mind.

1139
01:14:51,750 --> 01:14:54,110
- Why are you giving us five minutes?
- Give us five minutes.

1140
01:14:56,390 --> 01:14:58,100
- Lead the way.
- Lets go.

1141
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:05,990
I don't know what to buy.

1142
01:15:06,320 --> 01:15:10,600
- How about leggings like these?
- Yeah, that looks good.

1143
01:15:11,470 --> 01:15:14,690
[Jae Suk is trying to end their shopping trip
as quickly as he can.]

1144
01:15:15,230 --> 01:15:17,580
- We're getting some leggings.
- Some new leggings for Jong Sook.

1145
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:20,970
- We'll take these leggings.
- How much is this?

1146
01:15:20,980 --> 01:15:23,490
Here are a pair of black ones.
Let's go with the black ones.

1147
01:15:24,140 --> 01:15:25,980
Just buy whatever.

1148
01:15:25,980 --> 01:15:28,500
I'm going to go with the black one.
I didn't know there was a black one.

1149
01:15:29,140 --> 01:15:31,180
Hold my hand.

1150
01:15:31,180 --> 01:15:33,570
This is just like living hell.

1151
01:15:35,220 --> 01:15:37,830
Don't walk too fast,
and don't walk too slow either.

1152
01:15:39,080 --> 01:15:43,110
- Not too fast... and not too slow either.
- Listen, Jong Sook.

1153
01:15:43,110 --> 01:15:44,890
I'm walking alongside you right now.

1154
01:15:44,900 --> 01:15:46,910
[Jae Suk is exhausted from having to
cater to Jong Sook's needs.]

1155
01:15:46,910 --> 01:15:49,080
You two must be the couple.

1156
01:15:49,080 --> 01:15:50,910
- You two look good together.
- Don't we look good together?

1157
01:15:50,910 --> 01:15:53,540
- How long have you been together?
- It hasn't been that long.

1158
01:15:53,540 --> 01:15:55,730
We haven't been dating long,
but we're going to break up soon.

1159
01:15:55,730 --> 01:15:58,270
How can you say such a thing?
I'm not going in there.

1160
01:15:58,270 --> 01:16:00,400
Okay, I'm sorry!

1161
01:16:00,400 --> 01:16:03,170
[Jong Sook is mad by Jae Suk's comment.]

1162
01:16:03,170 --> 01:16:05,120
- Are you breaking up with me?
- No!

1163
01:16:08,280 --> 01:16:11,210
- Don't be in such a hurry.
- Okay, Honey.

1164
01:16:15,150 --> 01:16:17,380
You won't believe what we bought.

1165
01:16:19,830 --> 01:16:22,190
[Something unbelievable?]

1166
01:16:22,190 --> 01:16:24,120
[A bowl of rice?]

1167
01:16:24,120 --> 01:16:27,400
- What if this is an eating mission?
- I've got her.

1168
01:16:28,420 --> 01:16:32,170
- How can you treat a girl like that?
- If you can't eat, then you're the bad guy.

1169
01:16:35,460 --> 01:16:38,620
[All the couples make their way back
with their purchased items.]

1170
01:16:41,250 --> 01:16:42,460
You pick it.

1171
01:16:42,460 --> 01:16:43,790
I love you.

1172
01:16:45,360 --> 01:16:47,510
<i>[Word relay with the item you bought.]

1173
01:16:47,510 --> 01:16:51,250
[Word relay game within 30 seconds.]

1174
01:16:53,980 --> 01:16:57,160
- Delicious kodari.
- Delicious kodari.

1175
01:16:57,160 --> 01:17:00,550
P... Pretty leggings that you can buy
from a R-el cart.

1176
01:17:00,550 --> 01:17:04,360
S... delicious seaweed that even
the stars enjoy eating.

1177
01:17:05,950 --> 01:17:09,450
K... A filling kkot-gam that
I can eat when I feel empty and hungry.

1178
01:17:09,450 --> 01:17:12,430
Gam... Gamsa (thanks) for the delicious
bowl of rice!

1179
01:17:12,430 --> 01:17:14,470
- We did it.
- Yeah, we did it.

1180
01:17:17,550 --> 01:17:20,660
[Mission success]

1181
01:17:20,660 --> 01:17:22,220
We did it.

1182
01:17:22,220 --> 01:17:25,250
Both teams will receive their own hints.

1183
01:17:25,250 --> 01:17:26,840
[Both teams to receive a set of hints from
having succeeded two rounds of the mission.]

1184
01:17:26,850 --> 01:17:31,450
[Succeed the secret couple mission, then it's
real and fake hint. If not, just a real hint.]

1185
01:17:31,450 --> 01:17:33,140
Are they both real hints?

1186
01:17:33,140 --> 01:17:35,940
- It's one real, and one fake hint.
- Which ones are for which team?

1187
01:17:35,940 --> 01:17:37,600
[A real and a fake hint?]

1188
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:40,550
[Wait... there being two hints means...]

1189
01:17:41,300 --> 01:17:44,800
[During their first shopping trip...]

1190
01:17:44,810 --> 01:17:47,800
[While no one was
paying them any attention...]

1191
01:17:54,880 --> 01:17:59,080
[Even with Jae Suk, Bo Young, Suk Jin
and Sae Young right next to them...]

1192
01:18:00,450 --> 01:18:06,170
[They boldly succeeded their
secret couple mission!]

1193
01:18:16,750 --> 01:18:19,240
- We did it, right?
- Yes, I think we did.

1194
01:18:24,690 --> 01:18:27,770
[Even after being the first ones
to arrive back...]

1195
01:18:27,770 --> 01:18:31,200
[They do the mission again just in case
the first attempt wasn't valid.]

1196
01:18:33,570 --> 01:18:36,290
[The secret mission is definitely a success!]

1197
01:18:36,290 --> 01:18:39,040
This was my third time.
What have I done to deserve this?

1198
01:18:40,410 --> 01:18:41,690
They're coming.

1199
01:18:41,690 --> 01:18:44,570
[That's how the secret mission was completed.]

1200
01:18:44,570 --> 01:18:47,380
[Thus, one real and one fake hint.]

1201
01:18:47,380 --> 01:18:48,830
- Bye.
- I love you.

1202
01:18:48,830 --> 01:18:51,230
- Bye Jong Sook.
- Bye.

1203
01:18:51,230 --> 01:18:53,660
- It was fun.
- Yeah, right.

1204
01:18:54,450 --> 01:18:56,280
Don't think that we're over for good.

1205
01:18:58,100 --> 01:18:59,520
What does this mean?

1206
01:18:59,520 --> 01:19:00,890
What is this?

1207
01:19:01,720 --> 01:19:03,200
- What is this?
- What does that mean?

1208
01:19:03,200 --> 01:19:06,990
Don't you think that this is a phone number
or a text message of some sorts?

1209
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:08,760
[Could it be related to a phone number?]

1210
01:19:08,760 --> 01:19:11,000
- It's possible.
- What phone number?

1211
01:19:14,550 --> 01:19:18,820
[Difficult to make a correct guess since
the fake hint is mixed in there.]

1212
01:19:18,820 --> 01:19:20,230
I got it.

1213
01:19:20,230 --> 01:19:21,830
Okay, let's go.

1214
01:19:21,830 --> 01:19:24,040
It means that one of them is real.

1215
01:19:28,310 --> 01:19:33,060
[Real hint and a fake hint.]

1216
01:19:33,060 --> 01:19:36,710
- Wait, we need to figure out the hint.
- I know what it means.

1217
01:19:38,170 --> 01:19:41,930
[The mysterious number stands for
a person's name?]

1218
01:19:41,930 --> 01:19:44,480
Then we need to figure out
who's name it is?

1219
01:19:44,480 --> 01:19:47,420
[If they start decoding the numbers...]

1220
01:19:47,420 --> 01:19:50,040
[It means it's either
Park Bo Young and Gary...]

1221
01:19:50,040 --> 01:19:52,890
[Or Song Ji Hyo and Lee Jong Suk.]

1222
01:19:52,890 --> 01:19:54,960
- Why?
- Yeah, it's definitely Park Bo Young.

1223
01:19:54,960 --> 01:19:58,020
No, think about the very first
set of clues that we got.

1224
01:19:58,650 --> 01:20:01,160
Then what does that mean?
Who's the real culprit?

1225
01:20:01,160 --> 01:20:02,240
- Hey, Jong Suk.
- Yes?

1226
01:20:02,250 --> 01:20:04,600
- Be honest with us.
- It really isn't me.

1227
01:20:04,600 --> 01:20:07,190
- It's not you?
- I haven't even done anything all day!

1228
01:20:08,260 --> 01:20:10,240
- Jong Suk, is it you?
- No, it's not me.

1229
01:20:10,660 --> 01:20:13,550
Me and Bo Young?
What year was Bo Young born in?

1230
01:20:13,950 --> 01:20:16,510
- Bo Young was born in '94.
- She's 24 years old.

1231
01:20:16,510 --> 01:20:20,620
[The second set of numbers is '12'.
Could it be Bo Young and Gary's age gap?]

1232
01:20:21,550 --> 01:20:23,200
It's Kang Gary.

1233
01:20:23,200 --> 01:20:27,200
[Gary and Bo Young are the likely suspects
from what the numbers are indicating?]

1234
01:20:27,800 --> 01:20:32,010
[Please... don't change
your minds about that!]

1235
01:20:33,050 --> 01:20:37,260
[The final location-
School field in Haejeomun.]

1236
01:20:37,260 --> 01:20:40,540
[A giant sized picture frame and
a camera covered in flour?]

1237
01:20:40,550 --> 01:20:44,420
[Is it Jong Suk and Ji Hyo...
or Gary and Bo Young?]

1238
01:20:44,420 --> 01:20:46,030
- Wouldn't I be too obvious?
- That's why it's you.

1239
01:20:46,030 --> 01:20:47,670
There they come.

1240
01:20:49,280 --> 01:20:50,650
What?

1241
01:20:50,650 --> 01:20:53,250
- Maybe it's not her.
- Bo Young is next.

1242
01:20:54,310 --> 01:20:57,510
But keep this in mind.
We have an extra hint that you don't.

1243
01:20:57,510 --> 01:21:01,540
[They have an extra hint
that the other team doesn't?]

1244
01:21:01,540 --> 01:21:04,320
[A hint that we don't have?]

1245
01:21:04,470 --> 01:21:07,960
[All the members walking to pottery village
before they did the market mission.]

1246
01:21:08,780 --> 01:21:11,480
[These two are assuming some sort of
a position even here?]

1247
01:21:11,480 --> 01:21:13,810
I'm going to lose my mind.
You all keep thinking it's me?

1248
01:21:14,180 --> 01:21:18,270
[No way... you want me to do that?]

1249
01:21:18,810 --> 01:21:21,940
[The ultimate gesture- The back hug.]

1250
01:21:23,440 --> 01:21:25,140
[That's too hard.]

1251
01:21:27,850 --> 01:21:30,880
[The mission that they did here is
'The game of love'.]

1252
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:35,100
Yoo Jae Suk will make a heart sign with his
hands and point it towards someone.

1253
01:21:35,100 --> 01:21:36,620
He'll direct his heart to the next person.

1254
01:21:36,620 --> 01:21:41,010
If Song Ji Hyo accepts,
then she'll do the same thing to Ha Ha.

1255
01:21:41,010 --> 01:21:42,880
So it'll go around
in a circle in that manner.

1256
01:21:42,880 --> 01:21:45,740
If you don't want to accept
Yoo Jae Suk's love...

1257
01:21:45,740 --> 01:21:48,610
then you can choose your own method
to refuse his love.

1258
01:21:48,620 --> 01:21:50,360
[Can refuse his love in any methods
that you choose should you decide to refuse.]

1259
01:21:52,450 --> 01:21:55,200
[Will we be able to...]

1260
01:21:55,200 --> 01:22:00,280
[do a back hug here?]

1261
01:22:00,280 --> 01:22:04,760
Will the person accept it or not!
The game of love!

1262
01:22:06,950 --> 01:22:08,360
I love you.

1263
01:22:09,970 --> 01:22:11,400
I love you.

1264
01:22:15,400 --> 01:22:17,520
- I love you.
- Love you too.

1265
01:22:23,420 --> 01:22:27,230
[Mr. Gary's sincerity leaking through?]

1266
01:22:27,230 --> 01:22:30,100
- Gary needs to get punished.
- Must I get punished for that?

1267
01:22:30,110 --> 01:22:31,690
[Punishment is a kiss on the cheek,
befitting of the love game.]

1268
01:22:34,110 --> 01:22:38,050
[Sae Young and Bo Young's
double cheek kiss.]

1269
01:22:38,050 --> 01:22:40,340
Hurray!
Mother!

1270
01:22:42,340 --> 01:22:48,960
[It's not the kiss we need,
but a back hug we need...]

1271
01:22:49,500 --> 01:22:51,690
I just hope that Kwang Soo
doesn't come sit next to me.

1272
01:22:51,690 --> 01:22:52,960
[Time to swap seats.]

1273
01:22:53,480 --> 01:22:56,890
[Okay... Blank Ji is now sitting
now to Jong Suk.]

1274
01:22:56,890 --> 01:23:00,280
[She is sitting next to me now...]

1275
01:23:00,290 --> 01:23:03,120
[But suddenly feeling shy about doing it.]

1276
01:23:04,120 --> 01:23:05,720
I love you.

1277
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:07,670
I love you.

1278
01:23:08,880 --> 01:23:10,640
[Back hug]

1279
01:23:15,500 --> 01:23:17,540
[I don't think now's the time.]

1280
01:23:23,490 --> 01:23:26,190
[Automatically breaks out in a fit
of laughter upon seeing Kwang Ja's face.]

1281
01:23:26,850 --> 01:23:30,690
[I'm too embarrassed to do
the back hug!]

1282
01:23:30,690 --> 01:23:33,300
Here's your real hint.

1283
01:23:33,300 --> 01:23:35,280
[Only the real hint is given out
from having failed the secret mission.]

1284
01:23:36,140 --> 01:23:39,930
[We're in trouble...]

1285
01:23:40,790 --> 01:23:44,190
[Thus, the girl team earned themselves
an extra real hint.]

1286
01:23:44,550 --> 01:23:46,050
'Let's start a business'?

1287
01:23:46,050 --> 01:23:49,390
[What does this hint mean?]

1288
01:23:50,020 --> 01:23:52,930
- Are you guys still figuring it out?
- Let's move it along.

1289
01:23:52,930 --> 01:23:54,730
[The hint is making a difference
in what the two teams know?]

1290
01:23:54,740 --> 01:24:01,340
[They're still confused over whether it's
Jong Suk, Ji Hyo or Gary, Bo Young.]

1291
01:24:01,340 --> 01:24:04,960
He keeps denying that it's him,
but why aren't you doing the same?

1292
01:24:04,960 --> 01:24:07,400
- I told you earlier that it isn't me.
- Who do you think it is?

1293
01:24:07,400 --> 01:24:09,090
I think it's Jae Suk.

1294
01:24:09,450 --> 01:24:14,160
[Jong Suk is flustered from being cornered,
and still pointing fingers at Jae Suk.]

1295
01:24:16,560 --> 01:24:18,550
What is taking you guys so long?

1296
01:24:18,550 --> 01:24:20,830
- No other choice.
- Okay, we got it.

1297
01:24:20,830 --> 01:24:23,000
- We got it.
- We've made our decision.

1298
01:24:25,440 --> 01:24:28,870
[Secret couple, Ji Hyo and Jong Suk.
Can they still keep their secret?]

1299
01:24:29,380 --> 01:24:35,590
The male team will announce who they think is
the secret couple from having arrived first

1300
01:24:35,600 --> 01:24:38,210
and ask the couple to stand in front
of the frame that you seeing the middle.

1301
01:24:38,210 --> 01:24:40,750
[Please...]

1302
01:24:40,750 --> 01:24:43,620
- Okay, I'm going to count to five.
- Ji Hyo and Jong Suk.

1303
01:24:43,630 --> 01:24:45,660
- Okay, let's go with Ji Hyo and Jong Suk.
- Why?

1304
01:24:45,660 --> 01:24:47,210
- It's Ji Hyo and Jong Suk.
- Why?

1305
01:24:47,210 --> 01:24:50,380
- Look at how confident Ji Hyo looks.
- But she's an actress.

1306
01:24:50,380 --> 01:24:52,460
[Blank Ji is maintaining her poker face
all the way to the end.]

1307
01:24:52,460 --> 01:24:55,770
[Last minute chance to Gary?]

1308
01:24:56,140 --> 01:24:58,280
No, you've gotten much better
at lying lately.

1309
01:24:58,280 --> 01:25:01,358
What are you talking about?
Think about our Christmas special.

1310
01:25:01,358 --> 01:25:05,410
[Nervous... and anxious.]

1311
01:25:05,410 --> 01:25:08,040
What are you talking about?
Think about our Christmas special.

1312
01:25:08,040 --> 01:25:09,830
No, we can't even tell when you're
lying to us anymore.

1313
01:25:09,830 --> 01:25:13,020
Then I'll go stand up there right now.

1314
01:25:13,020 --> 01:25:15,270
Just hang on a second.

1315
01:25:15,580 --> 01:25:17,910
[The team is going back and forth
on their decision to the very last minute.]

1316
01:25:17,910 --> 01:25:19,950
[Please...]

1317
01:25:22,060 --> 01:25:23,760
Song Ji Hyo and Lee Jong Suk.

1318
01:25:24,260 --> 01:25:30,680
[Normally standoffish Ji Hyo was being
unusually friendly with Jong Suk today?]

1319
01:25:31,350 --> 01:25:35,030
Lee Jong Suk and Song Ji Hyo.

1320
01:25:35,540 --> 01:25:40,830
[Ah... our secret love affair...
Will this be the end of it?]

1321
01:25:42,590 --> 01:25:48,750
[Jong Suk and Ji Hyo are ultimately made
to go stand in front of the picture frame.]

1322
01:25:50,440 --> 01:25:54,060
[Preparing themselves to get showered
with the flour.]

1323
01:25:55,060 --> 01:25:56,660
Okay, time to take the picture.

1324
01:25:56,660 --> 01:25:59,990
[You did great today.]

1325
01:26:00,550 --> 01:26:05,390
One, two...

1326
01:26:06,600 --> 01:26:08,060
Two...

1327
01:26:08,570 --> 01:26:11,840
[The camera of truth!]

1328
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:26,180
- I knew that it was you two.
- I wasn't absolutely sure though.

1329
01:26:26,180 --> 01:26:29,280
- What made you so sure?
- The numbers.

1330
01:26:29,280 --> 01:26:32,610
And Jong Suk kept acting nervous.

1331
01:26:32,610 --> 01:26:36,600
It was either Gary or Jong Suk...
and Gary kept working on solving the hint.

1332
01:26:36,600 --> 01:26:39,100
- But Jong Suk didn't do that.
- He didn't want to solve the hint.

1333
01:26:39,110 --> 01:26:40,380
[Too bad.]

1334
01:26:40,380 --> 01:26:43,100
- The extra hint that we got is amazing.
- What is it?

1335
01:26:43,100 --> 01:26:45,250
'Let's start a business'.

1336
01:26:45,250 --> 01:26:46,850
What does that mean?

1337
01:26:46,860 --> 01:26:51,050
Look at the letters of it all.
It spells out Song Ji Hyo and Lee Jong Suk.

1338
01:26:52,720 --> 01:26:56,720
I knew something was off.
I felt kind of crappy all day long.

1339
01:26:56,720 --> 01:26:58,450
- They were too close all day.
- Did they not have any missions?

1340
01:26:58,450 --> 01:27:00,760
- We had a lot of missions to do.
- You did?

1341
01:27:00,760 --> 01:27:03,590
What did you guys do?

1342
01:27:03,590 --> 01:27:06,800
The first mission was to
clasp our hands together.

1343
01:27:07,530 --> 01:27:09,290
I saw the producers holding their hands!

1344
01:27:09,290 --> 01:27:11,190
- Who did?
- Why you...

1345
01:27:12,650 --> 01:27:14,820
I misunderstood and
thought that they were dating.

1346
01:27:14,820 --> 01:27:18,040
[They were just working hard
at their jobs.]

1347
01:27:18,040 --> 01:27:20,370
I thought that Jong Suk really liked
Ji Hyo for real.

1348
01:27:20,850 --> 01:27:23,040
But I should've known better.
That's not possible.

1349
01:27:23,040 --> 01:27:25,590
I guess Gary can go back to
enjoying eating again.

1350
01:27:25,590 --> 01:27:27,950
What about Jong Suk?

1351
01:27:27,950 --> 01:27:30,730
I told you that I'm not good at things
like this, and not to make me do it.

1352
01:27:30,730 --> 01:27:33,890
- I'm not good at things like this.
- It's because Jong Suk is too pure.
