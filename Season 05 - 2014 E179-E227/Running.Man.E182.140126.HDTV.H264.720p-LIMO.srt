Yeo Jin Goo.]

24
00:02:10,316 --> 00:02:12,120
Go away!
He doesn't look anything like you.

25
00:02:12,121 --> 00:02:14,341
Wow, look at his muscles.
His leg muscles are hard as a rock.

26

Jin Goo with muscles in all the right places.]

27
00:02:17,853 --> 00:02:20,974
You look like you work out a bit.
Do you work out?

28
00:02:21,528 --> 00:02:24,115
I really like sports.

29
00:02:24,116 --> 00:02:27,458
- I really like sports.
- Your voice!

30
00:02:27,459 --> 00:02:31,417
- Why do you have such a deep voice?
- Maybe his voice is starting to change.

31
00:02:32,236 --> 00:02:34,230
- His voice must be changing.
- Go away.

32
00:02:35,734 --> 00:02:39,069
[Kicked off to the other side of the room
from having made a foolish comment.]

33
00:02:39,435 --> 00:02:42,300
Go away!
Don't come anywhere near him.

34
00:02:42,301 --> 00:02:44,794
I can't even deal with him anymore.
He's driving me crazy.

35
00:02:44,795 --> 00:02:48,232
Jin Goo, can you say hello to
our viewers?

36
00:02:48,233 --> 00:02:51,300
Hello, it's great to meet all of you.
My name is Yeo Jin Goo.

[His voice is full of charisma.]

38
00:02:56,156 --> 00:02:59,318
- How old are you now?
- I just turned 18.

39
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:03,942
- Seriously?
- You may look 18, but you don't sound 18.

40
00:03:03,943 --> 00:03:06,521
Let's be honest,
he doesn't really look 18 either.

41
00:03:06,522 --> 00:03:08,385
What about him looks 18 to you?

42
00:03:08,859 --> 00:03:12,346

44
00:03:14,983 --> 00:03:19,422
- Look at how nice his skin looks.
- He's supposed to have nice skin at 18.

45
00:03:20,652 --> 00:03:22,397
- Don't you know that?
- Go down there.

46
00:03:24,127 --> 00:03:27,904
[Haroro is kicked down to the end of the line
as well for acting jealous of their guest.]

47

[The hottest woman of 2014- Do Hee.]

53
00:03:55,177 --> 00:03:56,894
- I can't believe it.
- Do Hee!

54
00:03:56,895 --> 00:03:58,839
- Hello.
- Yes, hello.

55
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,317
- Hello.
- Say something crass in satoori (a dialect) to us.

56
00:04:01,317 --> 00:04:03,816
- Why do you want me to talk like that?
- Come on, say something for us.

57
00:04:03,817 --> 00:04:06,256
[All her older 'uncle fans' wants to hear her
speak in her infamous satoori.]

58
00:04:06,256 --> 00:04:09,261
I'm going to rip your throat out if you even
think about coming after my [beeping] name tag.

59
00:04:09,511 --> 00:04:13,191
I'm going to rip your throat out if you even
think about coming after my [beeping] name tag.

60
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:16,737
[And coolly turns to walk
down to the front of the line.]

61
00:04:18,262 --> 00:04:19,465
That was great.

62
00:04:19,466 --> 00:04:21,273
[In total and utter shock.]

63
00:04:21,274 --> 00:04:23,585

00:04:32,133 --> 00:04:34,432
- She's such a great actress.
- She's so good at acting.

68
00:04:34,433 --> 00:04:37,772
- She's so good at what she does.
- Can you teach Kwang Soo how to act?

69
00:04:38,216 --> 00:04:41,086
[Age isn't a factor
when it comes to learning...]

70
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:43,353
- What are you talking about?
- You can come back up the line.

71
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:47,705
[Haroro moves back up the line by
selling Kwang Soo out?]

72
00:04:48,298 --> 00:04:52,864
Do Hee is our second rising guest star
following our first rising star, Jin Goo.

73
00:04:52,865 --> 00:04:55,249
So let's welcome our next rising star.
Please come on out.

74
00:04:55,701 --> 00:05:00,829
[2014 Running Man's Choice
third rising star is?]

75
00:05:06,928 --> 00:05:08,580
- Si Wan!
- It's Si Wan!

76
00:05:08,581 --> 00:05:12,750
[From an idol star to a rising actor,
Im Si Wan.]

77
00:05:12,751 --> 00:05:14,648
Im Si Wan!

78
00:05:18,859 --> 00:05:20,924
- Happy New Year.
- Thanks, Si Wan.

79
00:05:20,925 --> 00:05:23,511
- Si Wan's here.
- Happy New Year.

80
00:05:23,512 --> 00:05:26,071
I knew that he would become
a rising actor from his idol star status.

81
00:05:26,072 --> 00:05:28,382
- Our Si Wan is here now.
- It's good to see you.

82
00:05:28,383 --> 00:05:31,454
He was here once before when we had
our Idol Olympics.

83
00:05:31,455 --> 00:05:33,447
[Si Wan was on the show once before
for their Idol Olympics episode.]

84
00:05:33,448 --> 00:05:35,905
- I ripped off his name tag.
- He's been on our show many times.

85
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:38,904
- Actually, I've only been on this show once.
- It wasn't more than that?

86
00:05:38,905 --> 00:05:41,320
- No, this is my only second time on the show.
- Go down the line.

87
00:05:42,705 --> 00:05:46,006
[Swapping out the host of the show?]

88
00:05:46,007 --> 00:05:51,115
[Kkuk, Haroro, and Giraffe are excited
to be the new co-hosts of the show.]

89
00:05:51,116 --> 00:05:53,403
Yeah, I remember that you were
up against Gary, weren't you?

90
00:05:53,404 --> 00:05:55,497
People usually end up doing well on
their careers after they come on our show.

91
00:05:55,498 --> 00:05:57,263
He made his movie debut after
being on our show.

92
00:05:57,264 --> 00:05:59,587
I saw you in that movie,
and you did such a great job in it.

93
00:06:00,802 --> 00:06:03,677
You have to allow the guest to talk
instead of you doing all the talking.

94
00:06:05,057 --> 00:06:07,354
[Give me back my mic!]

95
00:06:07,355 --> 00:06:09,732
- Just let us do the job.
- Get back to your spot.

96
00:06:12,169 --> 00:06:15,276
[Kkuk, Haroro, and Giraffe-
The three MC's back to hosting the show.]

97
00:06:15,629 --> 00:06:19,093
- How do you feel about your movie coming out?
- I still feel...

98
00:06:19,094 --> 00:06:20,771
I'm sure he's feeling good about it.

99
00:06:22,874 --> 00:06:25,841
[MC asks, and MC answers...]

100
00:06:32,042 --> 00:06:34,682
How does it feel to be back on Running Man
again for the second time?

101
00:06:34,683 --> 00:06:35,957
Of course he feels great about it.

102
00:06:36,703 --> 00:06:39,274
- How does it feel?
- Of course he feels great about it.

103
00:06:40,588 --> 00:06:43,118
His movie is doing great,
and he's back on Running Man!

104
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:47,844
[I want you three out of here immediately!]

105
00:06:51,123 --> 00:06:53,373
So will these three guests be with us today
for the filming of today's episode?

106
00:06:53,374 --> 00:06:58,262
Yes, that's correct.
We'll now start 2014 Running Man Choice Race.

107
00:06:58,263 --> 00:07:01,538
- Today's mission is a very special mission.
- What is it?

108
00:07:01,539 --> 00:07:07,493
Our writing team received a video file
from overseas not too long ago.

109
00:07:07,494 --> 00:07:09,330
[A video file that the writing team
recently received.]

110
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:23,765
I'm a big fan of Running Man from Hong Kong,
and I always have a lot of ideas for the show.

111
00:07:24,178 --> 00:07:28,044
[Irene- 21 years old.
A student of Hong Kong Law School.]

112
00:07:28,685 --> 00:07:33,308
[A video letter that they received from
their fan in Hong Kong.]

113
00:07:35,306 --> 00:07:37,277
- She's very pretty.
- She is a very pretty woman.

114
00:07:37,278 --> 00:07:40,527
I really wish to take part
in your production team.

115
00:07:40,853 --> 00:07:42,928
Unfortunately, I don't live in South Korea

116
00:07:42,929 --> 00:07:47,108
so I guess this is the only way I can relay
my idea for the program over to you guys.

117
00:07:47,403 --> 00:07:50,461
I wish that you'd please consider my proposal.

118
00:07:52,936 --> 00:07:57,780
[The proposal and video was made with
love and dedication from this one fan...]

119
00:07:57,781 --> 00:08:01,620
I really look forward to your reply,
and thank you very much once again.

120
00:08:01,621 --> 00:08:04,192
Wish you a Merry Christmas,
and a Happy New Year.

121
00:08:06,978 --> 00:08:08,988
Happy New Year!
Thank you!

122
00:08:13,411 --> 00:08:17,416
- Our utmost gratitude once again.
- She first uploaded this on YouTube.

123
00:08:17,417 --> 00:08:19,857
Then she sent this video directly
over to our producer and writing team.

124
00:08:19,858 --> 00:08:22,187
[She sent this directly to the writing staff!]

125
00:08:22,188 --> 00:08:24,890
Our race was created by your fan,
and it's called, 'The Janggi Race.'

126
00:08:24,891 --> 00:08:28,351
[Today's mission- Janggi Race.
'Janggi'= Korean Chess.]

127
00:08:29,156 --> 00:08:30,531
<i>At the beginning of the show</i>

128
00:08:30,532 --> 00:08:33,989
<i>assuming there are seven Running Man
members and three guest members...</i>

129
00:08:34,349 --> 00:08:38,471
<i>There will be ten chess pieces in total.
Five red, and five black.</i>

130
00:08:39,038 --> 00:08:42,590
There will be a total of five red...

131
00:08:42,989 --> 00:08:45,644
and five green chess pieces.

132
00:08:45,645 --> 00:08:50,148
You will each choose a chess piece
that is different in rank.

133
00:08:50,183 --> 00:08:51,291
[Each player to choose one chess piece.]

134
00:08:51,869 --> 00:08:54,204
<i>Each member will then pick one of them.</i>

135
00:08:54,205 --> 00:08:57,679
<i>And their chess pieces will represent
their identities in the final mission.</i>

136
00:08:58,113 --> 00:09:02,699
<i>The color of their chess piece will represent
the color of their team in the final mission.</i>

137
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:08,205
Thus, you can't look at your own chess piece
until you get to the final mission location.

138
00:09:08,206 --> 00:09:09,851
[They can't look at their own chess piece
until they get to the final mission either.]

139
00:09:09,851 --> 00:09:13,179
But the person who wins the mission
in the midst of the race

140
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:16,815
will be given a chance to look at their
own chess piece to see what they have

141
00:09:16,816 --> 00:09:21,604
as well as a change to swap out their
chess piece with someone else.

142
00:09:21,605 --> 00:09:23,802
Then that means you can ultimately change
which team you'll end up in?

143
00:09:24,447 --> 00:09:26,454
Wow, this is making me kind of nervous.

144
00:09:27,127 --> 00:09:31,300
<i>There's no need to know which team
each other belongs to until the final mission.</i>

145
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:35,034
<i>And I advise everyone not to show their
chess piece to anyone else</i>

146
00:09:35,035 --> 00:09:39,368
<i>because that will be disadvantageous to
their own team during the final mission.</i>

147
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:43,135
<i>Throughout the day, there will be chances to
swap out which team you'll end up being in.</i>

148
00:09:43,136 --> 00:09:47,167
The chess pieces that will be shown
or swapped with each of the missions

149
00:09:47,168 --> 00:09:50,460
will all be revealed together
at the final mission

150
00:09:50,461 --> 00:09:54,269
and the members who possesses chess pieces
of the same color will be teamed up together

151
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:56,626
for the final mission,
which you'll be playing as a team.

152
00:09:56,627 --> 00:09:59,175
So my friend today could become
my enemy tomorrow?

153
00:09:59,516 --> 00:10:01,213
You're my enemy every day.

154
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:09,357
[Janggi piece selection complete.]

155
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:16,612
[A fate that follows the set of rules
sent to them by their Hong Kong fan.]

156
00:10:17,222 --> 00:10:20,148
[Village gymnasium in Paju.]

157
00:10:21,616 --> 00:10:24,258
- Where are we?
- What is that?

158
00:10:24,259 --> 00:10:26,104
What is all that now?

159
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,760
- What is that?
- What is this?

160
00:10:29,578 --> 00:10:34,379
This is the first mission that Irene Tam
created...

161
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:37,339
- This is the first mission.
- Ah, Irene?

162
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:42,224
This is the first game of the mission
that Irene created and sent over to us.

163
00:10:43,037 --> 00:10:44,792
Here's your first game.

164
00:10:44,793 --> 00:10:47,475
For this game,
you'll be divided into pairs.

165
00:10:47,476 --> 00:10:49,385
Pairs?

166
00:10:49,386 --> 00:10:51,114
- I want Do Hee.
- I want to be with Do Hee.

167
00:10:51,115 --> 00:10:52,727
- Me too.
- Me too.

168
00:10:52,728 --> 00:10:55,384
You know that I'm your partner, Do Hee.

169
00:10:56,729 --> 00:10:58,696
Let me see how you do first.

170
00:10:59,068 --> 00:11:00,856
Wow, that's quite a personality
you've got there.

171
00:11:00,857 --> 00:11:04,610
We're going to decide on the teams
before we start the game.

172
00:11:04,611 --> 00:11:07,855
- How you team up will be up to you.
- Why don't you choose your partner, Do Hee?

173
00:11:07,856 --> 00:11:10,472
I'm going to team up with the person
who does the best satoori.

174
00:11:10,473 --> 00:11:12,300
[Decides to team up with the person who can
speak in the best satoori.]

175
00:11:12,301 --> 00:11:14,243
[Keep it simple with just a single attempt.]

176
00:11:14,244 --> 00:11:15,959
I'm really...

177
00:11:16,386 --> 00:11:17,500
am sincere about this.

178
00:11:17,501 --> 00:11:19,413
- That's it.
- I'm really sincere about this.

179
00:11:19,414 --> 00:11:22,225
[Very weak and ambiguous performance.
That's his idea of satoori?]

180
00:11:24,097 --> 00:11:26,371
Okay, we've got him out of
the running at least.

181
00:11:26,641 --> 00:11:29,303
[Even he himself realizes how
awkward he just sounded.]

182
00:11:29,304 --> 00:11:31,157
Okay, it's Gary's turn now.

183
00:11:31,594 --> 00:11:34,573
Oh my... aren't you such a pretty thing.

184
00:11:34,574 --> 00:11:36,179
- Next.
- Okay.

185
00:11:36,661 --> 00:11:39,933
- Goodness... you're so pretty!
- Next!

186
00:11:40,669 --> 00:11:42,514
You're so pretty that you're almost scary.

187
00:11:42,515 --> 00:11:44,653
- Next.
- Come to me.

188
00:11:46,201 --> 00:11:48,661
- What the heck was that?
- How was that any different from mine?

189
00:11:48,662 --> 00:11:52,411
[Is this what a charismatic voice can do?]

190
00:11:52,412 --> 00:11:56,642
- You can't use your voice like that.
- His voice is way too nice.

191
00:11:56,643 --> 00:11:58,207
Suk Jin is next.

192
00:11:58,208 --> 00:12:02,071
If I could be reborn into my life,
you'd be the only woman that I'd love.

193
00:12:02,072 --> 00:12:04,331
You don't need to say anything further.
I think you can just stay in your spot.

194
00:12:04,332 --> 00:12:06,433
[Big-nose's overtly romantic confession
automatically gets him eliminated?]

195
00:12:07,387 --> 00:12:08,893
Next is Si Wan.

196
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:11,956
[Bleep-Bleep-Bleep!]

197
00:12:12,831 --> 00:12:14,914
[Oh my goodness!]

198
00:12:15,621 --> 00:12:18,312
[Such profanity from that innocent face?]

199
00:12:18,313 --> 00:12:21,606
- We're filming a show right now.
- That's one of my character's lines.

200
00:12:22,195 --> 00:12:25,394
- Do Hee! It's me!
- Just turn around.

201
00:12:26,382 --> 00:12:28,725
Okay, Do Hee's going to
make her selection now.

202
00:12:28,726 --> 00:12:30,781
[Who will Do Hee choose?]

203
00:12:30,782 --> 00:12:34,259
I'm going to choose the person who spoke
the best satoori.

204
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:36,438
Jong Kook.

205
00:12:36,439 --> 00:12:37,973
[Do Hee chooses Kim Jong Kook!]

206
00:12:38,526 --> 00:12:41,255
[Everyone immediately disputes
her decision.]

207
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:44,237
He didn't even sound like
he was speaking in satoori.

208
00:12:44,665 --> 00:12:47,364
Did you just choose him because you think
that we're going to play name tag elimination?

209
00:12:47,365 --> 00:12:50,128
- No, that's not it at all.
- Okay, Do Hee and Jong Kook.

210
00:12:50,129 --> 00:12:53,059
[First team is, Do Hee and Kim Jong Kook.]

211
00:12:53,658 --> 00:12:56,611
- Look at how red his face is getting.
- What are you talking about?

212
00:12:56,612 --> 00:12:58,388
[Who will Jin Goo choose?]

213
00:12:58,389 --> 00:13:00,555
I'm just going to choose the person who's
voice is most similar to mine.

214
00:13:02,252 --> 00:13:04,693
[Jin Goo chooses Ha Ha.]

215
00:13:05,736 --> 00:13:09,154
[Second team- Ha Ha and Jin Goo.]

216
00:13:09,155 --> 00:13:11,208
- It's Si Wan's turn.
- No, you did good.

217
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:15,734
[Si Wan decides to choose the person who can
do the best Kyungsan satoori impersonation.]

218
00:13:15,735 --> 00:13:18,009
- Kwang Soo can start.
- I think I can handle Kyungsando satoori.

219
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:20,292
- Start.
- I'm being really sincere.

220
00:13:21,233 --> 00:13:22,947
I'm being really sincere.

221
00:13:27,701 --> 00:13:30,738
- Was that Namyangju satoori?
- That's not how I meant to say it!

222
00:13:31,315 --> 00:13:32,603
Ji Hyo's turn.

223
00:13:32,889 --> 00:13:35,653
Si Wan, you're starting to
act like a brat again.

224
00:13:38,415 --> 00:13:41,279
- I forgot Ji Hyo's from Pohang!
- I'm from Pohang.

225
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,634
I forgot that Ji Hyo's from Pohang.

226
00:13:43,635 --> 00:13:44,984
Si Wa-ee!

227
00:13:44,985 --> 00:13:47,717
You've still got it, Si Wa-ee!

228
00:13:47,815 --> 00:13:50,036
I had too much to eat.

229
00:13:50,037 --> 00:13:54,310
[Only satoori he knows are lines
that he's heard from movies.]

230
00:13:54,311 --> 00:13:56,539
Why are you reciting lines from
the movie, 'Friends'?

231
00:13:57,422 --> 00:14:00,172
[Who will Si Wan choose?]

232
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:04,150
Satoori was pretty close...
and since we have to hold hands...

233
00:14:04,772 --> 00:14:06,857
[Si Wan chooses Ji Hyo.]

234
00:14:06,858 --> 00:14:08,094
Why are you doing this?

235
00:14:09,696 --> 00:14:11,904
She was my only hope!
Why are you doing this to me?

236
00:14:11,905 --> 00:14:14,716
- Si Wan's my partner.
- Si Wan!

237
00:14:15,934 --> 00:14:19,831
Si Wan's grown bolder these days.
You shouldn't have done that, Si Wan.

238
00:14:20,477 --> 00:14:23,992
[Fourth Team- Gary and Kwang Soo.
Fifth Team- Suk Jin and Jae Suk.]

239
00:14:24,617 --> 00:14:26,794
<i>Mission one is about lion dance.</i>

240
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,736
[Team selection for
the first mission is complete.]

241
00:14:29,737 --> 00:14:33,989
<i>Ten members will team up in pairs
to form a total of five teams.</i>

242
00:14:37,379 --> 00:14:39,214
- Okay, let's go inside.
- Okay.

243
00:14:39,215 --> 00:14:41,284
[Everyone heads into
the mission location together.]

244
00:14:43,886 --> 00:14:45,157
- What is this?
- Oh my God.

245
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:49,531
The acupuncture mat again?

246
00:14:54,947 --> 00:15:00,625
[Actually...
it's a gigantic acupuncture mat track.]

247
00:15:00,626 --> 00:15:02,668
It's the acupuncture mat again?

248
00:15:02,923 --> 00:15:05,388
[Their immediate future is looking bleak.]

249
00:15:07,069 --> 00:15:09,646
- Wow, that looks painful.
- Look at the size of this thing.

250
00:15:17,282 --> 00:15:21,161
[The bottoms of our feet...
are going to feel like they're on fire...]

251
00:15:21,162 --> 00:15:22,660
Why don't you read it, Do Hee?

252
00:15:22,661 --> 00:15:24,178
Read it out loud?

253
00:15:24,179 --> 00:15:27,150
Do I just read it out loud?
I get nervous doing things like this.

254
00:15:27,151 --> 00:15:28,811
- What do I do?
- Just read it.

255
00:15:28,812 --> 00:15:31,987
Today's mission.
Horse race!

256
00:15:31,988 --> 00:15:34,006
[Today's race- Horse race.]

257
00:15:34,007 --> 00:15:39,344
The team to race around the track the fastest
while wearing the horse mask wins.

258
00:15:39,345 --> 00:15:40,753
Okay!

259
00:15:40,754 --> 00:15:42,228
Is this going to be timed?

260
00:15:42,229 --> 00:15:45,494
Yes, this game was sent to us by Irene.

261
00:15:46,243 --> 00:15:49,692
<i>Mission 1A is the acupuncture hurdle race.</i>

262
00:15:50,095 --> 00:15:53,870
<i>Each lion has to complete a sequence
of tasks on the track.</i>

263
00:15:55,871 --> 00:15:58,883
Chinese people traditionally wear a lion mask
for the new year

264
00:15:58,884 --> 00:16:02,189
but we're going to do the race while wearing
the horse mask

265
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:04,100
since it's the year of the horse.

266
00:16:04,422 --> 00:16:08,785
Each team just needs to race around
the track once while wearing the horse mask.

267
00:16:08,786 --> 00:16:10,655
[First course- Acupuncture hurdle.]

268
00:16:10,656 --> 00:16:12,716
[Second course- Acupuncture obstacle course.]

269
00:16:12,717 --> 00:16:14,666
[Third course- Acupuncture slope.]

270
00:16:14,667 --> 00:16:18,744
[Fourth course-
The ultimate acupuncture track.]

271
00:16:18,745 --> 00:16:21,424
In the case that the hurdle falls over...

272
00:16:21,425 --> 00:16:23,468
we will deduct three seconds
from your total time.

273
00:16:23,469 --> 00:16:25,984
In the case of those obstacle course
markers fall down

274
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:27,775
we will deduct two seconds
from your total time.

275
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:33,095
- Then... Kwang Soo and Gary will go first.
- Why?

276
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:34,572
[First horse- Kwang Soo and Gary.]

277
00:16:36,535 --> 00:16:38,415
This is scary.

278
00:16:38,416 --> 00:16:40,027
Let's make it interesting.

279
00:16:41,615 --> 00:16:44,730
[One person to be the horse's head,
and the other person to be the body.]

280
00:16:44,731 --> 00:16:46,532
What are you talking about, Gary?

281
00:16:50,061 --> 00:16:52,945
- They're going to do it like that?
- How are they going to run like that?

282
00:16:52,946 --> 00:16:57,865
Hey, Kwang Soo...
You're making me feel nervous.

283
00:16:57,866 --> 00:16:59,582
- You can't do that.
- We can't do it like this?

284
00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:01,778
[Other than when jumping over the hurdle,
all four feet has to be on the ground.]

285
00:17:12,623 --> 00:17:14,932
- Are you okay?
- Be more gentle!

286
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:18,353
- I'm going to run real fast, okay?
- Okay, Gary.

287
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,742
- Follow my lead, okay?
- Ready.

288
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:30,853
- What are you doing? What are you doing!
- You're too heavy!

289
00:17:31,564 --> 00:17:33,750
What are you doing?
What is this!

290
00:17:33,751 --> 00:17:37,578
[First course- Hurdle jumping.
Or hurdle crashing.]

291
00:17:39,076 --> 00:17:41,429
- My toes!
- Run!

292
00:17:44,639 --> 00:17:46,734
[Horse Gary and Kwang Soo
falls down to the ground.]

293
00:17:54,926 --> 00:17:56,099
Wait!

294
00:18:05,597 --> 00:18:06,888
Get up!

295
00:18:06,889 --> 00:18:08,752
[When are they ever going to
complete their course?]

296
00:18:11,819 --> 00:18:14,106
- That really does hurt though.
- Hurry!

297
00:18:14,464 --> 00:18:16,684
[Knocked down every single hurdle.]

298
00:18:16,685 --> 00:18:19,103
[Approaching their second course-
Acupuncture obstacle course.]

299
00:18:19,104 --> 00:18:20,947
- Just roll, Gary. Roll.
- Roll?

300
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:26,696
[Horse Gary and Kwang Soo's plan
is to just roll through the course.]

301
00:18:29,109 --> 00:18:32,371
[The agony they're to feel on their feet
are being felt with their whole body.]

302
00:18:33,379 --> 00:18:35,040
I bet that hurts even more.

303
00:18:36,103 --> 00:18:38,417
- I bet that hurts even more.
- That looks so painful.

304
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,118
[Third course- Acupuncture slope.]

305
00:18:50,403 --> 00:18:53,059
[Body Kwang Soo is just being dragged along.]

306
00:18:58,166 --> 00:19:00,817
[Gary... please spare me my life.]

307
00:19:03,187 --> 00:19:05,790
- What are you doing?
- Wait!

308
00:19:08,694 --> 00:19:11,390
[These onlookers are watching
with ease from the sidelines for now.]

309
00:19:12,784 --> 00:19:15,427
[Desperate thrashing of their bodies.]

310
00:19:25,027 --> 00:19:27,759
[Backtracking on the ultimate
acupuncture mat.]

311
00:19:28,684 --> 00:19:30,722
Why are you walking backwards
instead of walking forward?

312
00:19:30,723 --> 00:19:33,647
[Finding their wherewithal to
start moving forward again.]

313
00:19:34,045 --> 00:19:37,338
[Their final course-
Forward on the ultimate acupuncture mat.]

314
00:19:38,791 --> 00:19:41,190
- Why are you moving backwards?
- Wait!

315
00:19:50,194 --> 00:19:51,794
[Barely manages to arrive at the finish line.]

316
00:19:51,795 --> 00:19:53,182
Enough!

317
00:19:57,788 --> 00:20:01,051
Thank you, Irene! We got to
play such a fun game thanks to you!

318
00:20:01,273 --> 00:20:03,308
- I love you, Irene!
- I love Hong Kong!

319
00:20:04,938 --> 00:20:06,915
- I love Hong Kong!
- I love you, Hong Kong!

320
00:20:06,916 --> 00:20:09,583
- H.K!
- I will never forget you, Irene!

321
00:20:10,815 --> 00:20:13,989
Your time is,
two minutes and 34 seconds.

322
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:15,775
[Horse Gary and Kwang Soo-
Two minutes and 34 seconds.]

323
00:20:15,776 --> 00:20:17,817
- Do Hee, do you want to...
- Ouch, that hurts.

324
00:20:18,652 --> 00:20:20,094
That really hurts.

325
00:20:21,602 --> 00:20:24,021
- Does it really hurt that bad?
- Yes.

326
00:20:24,022 --> 00:20:26,186
How are we going to do the hurdles?

327
00:20:26,187 --> 00:20:28,717
[The hurdles are the big problem...]

328
00:20:29,388 --> 00:20:31,386
These pants are...

329
00:20:31,387 --> 00:20:34,699
- They're too long.
- The pants are too long on Do Hee.

330
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:37,357
[The horse costume is way too big on Do Hee.]

331
00:20:37,358 --> 00:20:39,406
These aren't fitting me very well.

332
00:20:39,407 --> 00:20:41,148
You're not being very considerate
to our guest.

333
00:20:41,149 --> 00:20:43,950
Can I pull them up like this?

334
00:20:44,428 --> 00:20:47,292
[The hurdles are too high for
tiny Do Hee to jump over...]

335
00:20:47,293 --> 00:20:50,672
[What are we going to do about this?]

336
00:20:52,172 --> 00:20:55,316
- Do Hee, are you ready?
- Yes, I'm ready.

337
00:20:55,932 --> 00:20:57,275
Get ready.

338
00:21:01,221 --> 00:21:02,525
Do I have to jump?

339
00:21:02,526 --> 00:21:03,808
[The problematic hurdle.]

340
00:21:15,263 --> 00:21:17,394
Do Hee's going to fall over backwards,
Jong Kook!

341
00:21:17,395 --> 00:21:19,964
[Mr. Capable jumps over the hurdles without
hesitation with Do Hee on his shoulder.]

342
00:21:23,051 --> 00:21:26,327
[Horse Jong Kook and Do Hee remain erect
as they move through the course.]

343
00:21:27,877 --> 00:21:30,548
[Easily passes through even the last hurdle.]

344
00:21:30,549 --> 00:21:32,032
What are they doing?

345
00:21:33,472 --> 00:21:34,994
[Time to start running!]

346
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:39,238
[Passes through the second course
at top speed.]

347
00:21:40,546 --> 00:21:43,020
[Breezing through even the third course.]

348
00:21:45,167 --> 00:21:46,946
[Gritting down on her teeth.]

349
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:55,004
[Even the onlookers can feel their agony.]

350
00:21:56,871 --> 00:22:00,151
[Zipping through their final course.]

351
00:22:02,853 --> 00:22:04,006
We're ruined.

352
00:22:05,479 --> 00:22:08,494
[The agony finally sets in.]

353
00:22:09,527 --> 00:22:12,509
[Horse Jong Kook and Do Hee completed their
course with phenomenal teamwork.]

354
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:14,946
[Automatically breaks out in a round
of applause for their teamwork.]

355
00:22:15,941 --> 00:22:17,772
Thank goodness it's over.

356
00:22:18,551 --> 00:22:20,163
- Your record is...
- Yes?

357
00:22:21,634 --> 00:22:24,415
I'm just going to tell you your record,
and you have to add ten seconds to that.

358
00:22:24,416 --> 00:22:26,217
- Okay.
- Your record is 49 seconds.

359
00:22:26,718 --> 00:22:30,227
[49 seconds plus 10 seconds for the hurdles
equals a total of 59 seconds.]

360
00:22:30,228 --> 00:22:31,871
[That's amazing.]

361
00:22:33,301 --> 00:22:35,311
Okay, Jin Goo and Ha Ha's turn.

362
00:22:35,312 --> 00:22:38,291
- Jin Goo's really determined right now.
- Just get moving.

363
00:22:39,283 --> 00:22:41,663
- Good luck, Jin Goo.
- Show us what you got, Jin Goo.

364
00:22:46,153 --> 00:22:48,161
This looks painful.

365
00:22:58,293 --> 00:23:01,339
- That over there is the problem.
- Over there?

366
00:23:01,889 --> 00:23:05,407
[Just you wait... acupuncture mat...]

367
00:23:06,579 --> 00:23:11,061
[Focusing on the preparation
without uttering a single word.]

368
00:23:14,683 --> 00:23:18,943
[Fierce determination...
with his focus on the victory.]

369
00:23:19,725 --> 00:23:22,057
Jin Goo's really determined.

370
00:23:22,058 --> 00:23:24,397
- Jin Goo's determined.
- Yeah, Jin Goo's determined to win.

371
00:23:24,398 --> 00:23:28,048
[Serious young man.
Jin Goo's ready to attack.]

372
00:23:38,416 --> 00:23:41,181
[Bulldozer Yeo Jin Goo,
ramming through the hurdles in his path.]

373
00:23:44,138 --> 00:23:47,870
[Don't block my path!]

374
00:23:53,129 --> 00:23:56,373
[Passing through the obstacle course at top
speed without knocking anything down!]

375
00:24:00,143 --> 00:24:02,400
[He's quick.]

376
00:24:02,401 --> 00:24:06,085
[Hind legs Ha Ha being dragged around by
determined forelegs Jin Goo.]

377
00:24:07,517 --> 00:24:10,033
[Entering the ultimate acupuncture mat path
in the blink of an eye.]

378
00:24:10,034 --> 00:24:12,876
[Even though he may scream out in pain,
he's not slowing down his speed.]

379
00:24:12,877 --> 00:24:15,149
[There's no stopping him!]

380
00:24:16,762 --> 00:24:18,569
Stop tormenting Dong Hoon!

381
00:24:23,501 --> 00:24:26,239
[Knocked down to the ground the moment
they pass through the finish line.]

382
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:29,239
Wow, they were quick.

383
00:24:29,689 --> 00:24:31,779
[Oh dear God...]

384
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:37,495
That really hurt.

385
00:24:40,502 --> 00:24:43,589
[The bottoms of their feet are on fire.]

386
00:24:49,197 --> 00:24:51,499
Jin Goo's fierce determination
is something to be reckoned with.

387
00:24:53,285 --> 00:24:55,425
He didn't even say anything.

388
00:24:55,426 --> 00:24:58,358
[Jin Goo having put all his focus on finishing
the race without saying a single word.]

389
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,299
Even his screams were like this...

390
00:25:12,457 --> 00:25:15,361
[Full speed ahead
Ha Ha and Jin Goo's record is?]

391
00:25:15,362 --> 00:25:18,355
- It'll be an additional 22 seconds.
- He said he's adding 22 seconds.

392
00:25:18,356 --> 00:25:20,518
[It's an additional 22 seconds...]

393
00:25:22,116 --> 00:25:23,979
I thought that was the total time.

394
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:25,127
Your record is...

395
00:25:25,413 --> 00:25:28,841
[What is their speedy record?]

396
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:33,711
Your record is 36 seconds.

397
00:25:33,712 --> 00:25:34,965
[Their record is 36 seconds!]

398
00:25:34,966 --> 00:25:37,097
- Then what is their total record?
- 58 seconds!

399
00:25:37,932 --> 00:25:40,673
[Real record is 36 seconds, plus 22 seconds,
with a total of 58 seconds.]

400
00:25:41,016 --> 00:25:43,610
[Ha Ha and Jin Goo take the lead
with a mere one second difference!]

401
00:25:44,553 --> 00:25:49,869
<i>The winners can choose to keep their piece,
or swap with any one of the loser teams.</i>

402
00:25:52,261 --> 00:25:56,760
The team that came in at first place will be
given the chance to see their own chess piece

403
00:25:56,761 --> 00:26:00,411
and a chance to swap out their piece
with any of the other players.

404
00:26:00,412 --> 00:26:02,669
The winner will now have a chance to look
and swap out their piece with someone else.

405
00:26:03,715 --> 00:26:06,850
[Ha Ha checks his own chess piece.]

406
00:26:09,154 --> 00:26:12,452
[Ha Ha's chess piece is, the king piece.]

407
00:26:17,988 --> 00:26:20,296
I don't know if it's right for me to
have this kind of honor.

408
00:26:20,297 --> 00:26:21,770
How could this have even happened?

409
00:26:21,771 --> 00:26:25,209
It seems as though...
I'm the main star of this episode today.

410
00:26:26,049 --> 00:26:28,125
You can pick one of the other members
to see what piece they have.

411
00:26:28,125 --> 00:26:31,036
He's still quite young...
but he's got some Kim Jong Kook in him.

412
00:26:34,193 --> 00:26:36,310
[Ha Ha chooses to check Yeo Jin Goo's piece.]

413
00:26:38,828 --> 00:26:40,369
Would you like to swap
your piece out with his?

414
00:26:40,369 --> 00:26:42,679
- No, not at all.
- You're not going to swap yours out?

415
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,305
No, I have no desire to do that.

416
00:26:44,889 --> 00:26:46,637
Yeo Jin Goo is a young Kim Jong Kook.

417
00:26:48,092 --> 00:26:50,149
You can check your own piece first.

418
00:26:51,465 --> 00:26:53,605
You have to open it carefully
so that no one else can see what it is.

419
00:26:53,606 --> 00:26:55,241
[Must open it carefully so that
no one else can see what it is.]

420
00:26:55,242 --> 00:26:56,726
I can see it, Jin Goo.

421
00:26:57,323 --> 00:26:58,615
I can see it.

422
00:27:01,748 --> 00:27:03,781
Even your surprised voice is that deep?

423
00:27:03,782 --> 00:27:04,935
[Even his surprised voice is deep and low.]

424
00:27:06,527 --> 00:27:12,767
And you may now choose one person...
one person who concerns you

425
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:15,755
and see which piece they have to decide if
you want to swap your piece our with theirs.

426
00:27:17,014 --> 00:27:20,001
[Jin Goo selects Mr. Capable,
Jong Kook's piece.]

427
00:27:22,432 --> 00:27:25,130
[Mr. Capable's piece is, 'Horse'.]

428
00:27:26,537 --> 00:27:30,605
[Jong Kook's piece is higher than
Jin Goo's by two levels.]

429
00:27:30,606 --> 00:27:33,092
- I'd like to switch my piece with his.
- Okay.

430
00:27:33,127 --> 00:27:38,946
Then you may switch out your chess piece
with his in the box.

431
00:27:45,031 --> 00:27:46,491
You may go back to your seat.

432
00:27:49,129 --> 00:27:52,478
- It's another paired game.
- Okay, let's go.

433
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:01,306
[Ah... that's...]

434
00:28:02,308 --> 00:28:03,966
Okay, everyone come this way.

435
00:28:03,967 --> 00:28:05,938
[What is all this?]

436
00:28:09,131 --> 00:28:11,065
What is that?
They even have the Blob Jump set up.

437
00:28:15,252 --> 00:28:17,961
[Set up all throughout the whole
swimming pool arena...]

438
00:28:17,962 --> 00:28:23,051
[Is a ginormous water game setup that's
bigger than anything else they've ever seen.]

439
00:28:23,052 --> 00:28:27,718
[Just what is the water game mission
that awaits them here?]

440
00:28:27,719 --> 00:28:32,625
I want everyone to read the Running Man's
Big Three relay game sign in front of you.

441
00:28:34,069 --> 00:28:36,022
<i>You must utilize all three games
that are set up in the pool area.</i>

442
00:28:36,023 --> 00:28:38,583
<i>Every game that is played will be measured
in 'meters' to determine your record.</i>

443
00:28:38,583 --> 00:28:43,505
<i>The team that has a combined score of 30m
by playing each course only once wins.</i>

444
00:28:45,241 --> 00:28:47,790
[Big One- Flying chair basketball.]

445
00:28:47,791 --> 00:28:49,691
[Big Two- Blob Jump.]

446
00:28:49,918 --> 00:28:53,322
[And lastly...]

447
00:28:53,323 --> 00:28:57,379
[Big Three- Diving.]

448
00:28:57,380 --> 00:29:00,018
- Diving too?
- No way.

449
00:29:00,526 --> 00:29:04,141
As you can all see for yourselves,
this game is called, Running Man's Big Three.

450
00:29:04,512 --> 00:29:05,962
I'd like to welcome everyone
to the mission.

451
00:29:05,963 --> 00:29:10,100
You have to utilize all three game courses
that we've set up around the swimming pool.

452
00:29:10,346 --> 00:29:15,081
The first team to get a total of 30m
by utilizing all three will win this mission.

453
00:29:15,751 --> 00:29:17,153
Diving.

454
00:29:17,596 --> 00:29:19,173
Flying chair.

455
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:20,920
Blob Jump.
All three of these game courses.

456
00:29:20,921 --> 00:29:22,636
You have to play all three of these games.

457
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:27,285
You have the freedom to determine which team
will go first in each of the game courses.

458
00:29:27,286 --> 00:29:30,206
But... the same game cannot be played
twice in a row.

459
00:29:30,451 --> 00:29:32,464
So it's like waiting turns
at an amusement park?

460
00:29:32,465 --> 00:29:33,531
Yes, it's the Big Three.

461
00:29:33,566 --> 00:29:35,792
With the flying chair, you won't know when
you'll get propelled out of the chair

462
00:29:35,793 --> 00:29:38,048
but you'll have to throw the ball the moment
you're propelled out of your chair.

463
00:29:38,049 --> 00:29:42,820
And only those balls that lands within
a basket will count towards your total score.

464
00:29:42,821 --> 00:29:45,053
And both members of the team can
attempt the same game course.

465
00:29:45,054 --> 00:29:46,918
Since the mission is a bit disorderly

466
00:29:47,248 --> 00:29:50,350
we've decided to choose winners for first
through third place, instead of just first.

467
00:29:50,351 --> 00:29:55,051
And the person who comes in at first place
will be given a very special advantage

468
00:29:55,052 --> 00:29:58,483
and second and third place winners will
also be given some sort of an advantage.

469
00:29:58,484 --> 00:30:01,773
The mission will start the moment
the whistle is blown.

470
00:30:01,774 --> 00:30:07,042
You can determine for yourselves where
you and your teammate will start the mission.

471
00:30:07,043 --> 00:30:08,810
[Keeping an eye on your opponents to
determine their game plan is also vital.]

472
00:30:08,811 --> 00:30:09,892
Three.

473
00:30:11,854 --> 00:30:15,486
- Three, two, one...
- We're going to do the Flying Chair.

474
00:30:15,487 --> 00:30:19,553
[Running Man Big Three- Start!]

475
00:30:20,855 --> 00:30:24,054
[Jae Suk and Jin Goo are going to tackle
the tough diving board first!]

476
00:30:25,831 --> 00:30:28,332
Let's do that one first.
Let's go for the diving boards.

477
00:30:29,272 --> 00:30:31,254
You can jump off the 1m board,
and I'll go for the 5m board.

478
00:30:31,255 --> 00:30:37,112
[Welcome to the diving board.]

479
00:30:38,186 --> 00:30:40,066
I don't know which one I should jump off of.

480
00:30:41,988 --> 00:30:44,013
Which meter board should we jump off of?

481
00:30:44,014 --> 00:30:47,282
[They can choose from either
1m, 3m, 5m, 7.5m or 10m board.]

482
00:30:48,294 --> 00:30:51,942
- I don't know about the 7.5m or 10m board.
- Then go for the 5m board.

483
00:30:52,692 --> 00:30:56,879
There's no need to go too crazy with this.
If we can each jump off of a 5m...

484
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:01,432
[Going up to the 5m board first...]

485
00:31:04,664 --> 00:31:07,075
- This one isn't easy either.
- All I need to do is jump, right?

486
00:31:07,076 --> 00:31:08,696
Hang on a second.

487
00:31:14,669 --> 00:31:17,905
[Meanwhile, Gary and Ji Hyo are at
the Blob Jump course.]

488
00:31:17,906 --> 00:31:19,408
Yes, I heard.

489
00:31:19,409 --> 00:31:22,266
- Who's going to jump?
- Ji Hyo will take the lead on this one.

490
00:31:22,267 --> 00:31:24,793
[As guessed,
Ace Ji Hyo will be the human bullet.]

491
00:31:25,941 --> 00:31:29,107
No matter how many times we do this,
things like this still scares me.

492
00:31:29,108 --> 00:31:31,056
I still get scared of it
every single time we do it.

493
00:31:31,057 --> 00:31:34,327
I know you spent a lot of money on this,
but don't you think you still use it too much?

494
00:31:38,119 --> 00:31:39,837
I'm seriously going to lose my mind.

495
00:31:41,034 --> 00:31:42,797
Jae Suk, are you going to jump
off of the 5m board?

496
00:31:42,798 --> 00:31:45,577
What?
I need to jump 5m at least.

497
00:31:45,578 --> 00:31:47,358
I'm thinking of doing the 1m jump.

498
00:31:47,359 --> 00:31:49,617
How about you jump the 5m board,
and I'll jump the 7.5m board.

499
00:31:49,618 --> 00:31:52,342
You think you can do that?
7.5m is really scary.

500
00:31:52,343 --> 00:31:53,835
- I'm going to go take a look.
- Go check it out.

501
00:31:53,836 --> 00:31:55,846
- Jin Goo!
- What's wrong with him?

502
00:31:55,847 --> 00:31:58,974
- What are you doing?
- What is he doing?

503
00:31:58,975 --> 00:32:01,436
What are you doing?
What are you planning on doing?

504
00:32:01,895 --> 00:32:07,626
[Courageous Jin Goo fearlessly
climbs up to the 7.5m diving board.]

505
00:32:07,627 --> 00:32:09,904
- I can do this.
- You okay with that?

506
00:32:10,758 --> 00:32:13,216
- 7.5m?
- Yes, I think I can jump.

507
00:32:14,281 --> 00:32:19,560
Wow... if we both jump from 7.5m,
then we'd get a total of 15m.

508
00:32:25,573 --> 00:32:26,964
What do you want to do, Jae Suk?

509
00:32:26,965 --> 00:32:30,618
[Jae Suk's climbing up to the 7.5m board too?]

510
00:32:33,245 --> 00:32:37,075
[But... wow...]

511
00:32:38,407 --> 00:32:42,999
[That's really high.]

512
00:32:43,799 --> 00:32:45,801
I'll jump the 7.5m board.

513
00:32:45,802 --> 00:32:47,637
- Will you be okay?
- Yes, I'll be fine.

514
00:32:48,576 --> 00:32:51,083
- I really like the water.
- Really?

515
00:32:51,769 --> 00:32:53,885
Okay, Jin Goo.
Then jump the 7.5m board!

516
00:32:53,886 --> 00:32:55,268
- Okay, I'll do it.
- Okay.

517
00:32:56,233 --> 00:33:00,098
[Courageously walks up to the front
of the diving board...]

518
00:33:00,653 --> 00:33:04,154
Jin Goo's jumping the 7.5m.
7.5m!

519
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:06,194
I'm going to jump the 7.5m board!

520
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:08,220
Jin Goo!

521
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:10,660
Yeo Jin Goo!

522
00:33:11,326 --> 00:33:12,952
Just get back down!

523
00:33:13,628 --> 00:33:15,624
Think about this carefully, Jin Goo!

524
00:33:15,625 --> 00:33:18,906
[All eyes are on him.]

525
00:33:18,907 --> 00:33:21,005
- Hey, Jin Goo!
- Why is he doing that?

526
00:33:21,006 --> 00:33:22,729
Hey, Yeo Jin Goo!

527
00:33:22,730 --> 00:33:24,202
Okay, I'm ready!

528
00:33:24,203 --> 00:33:30,778
[Even with everyone's protest...
it doesn't shake his determination.]

529
00:33:33,556 --> 00:33:36,046
Jin Goo... you can jump come back down
to the 5m if you can't do it.

530
00:33:36,713 --> 00:33:37,938
No, I can do it.

531
00:33:37,939 --> 00:33:41,322
[But... Jin Goo's determined.]

532
00:33:46,281 --> 00:33:51,675
[Okay... I can do this!]

533
00:33:52,669 --> 00:33:53,983
No!

534
00:33:53,984 --> 00:33:57,324
- Jin Goo!
- Is he really going to jump off that board?

535
00:33:57,325 --> 00:33:58,995
[The onlookers are even more
nervous than he is.]

536
00:34:02,294 --> 00:34:05,969
[Oh!]

537
00:34:05,970 --> 00:34:07,987
[Jump!]

538
00:34:18,386 --> 00:34:21,809
[Brave Jin Goo jumps in a single attempt
without a single moment of hesitation.]

539
00:34:25,654 --> 00:34:27,685
[A perfect dive.]

540
00:34:32,026 --> 00:34:37,572
[This is what you call...
a perfect diving form.]

541
00:34:42,642 --> 00:34:45,996
[What am I going to do now?]

542
00:34:47,576 --> 00:34:51,844
[Very cool, Yeo Jin Goo!]

543
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:57,055
[Jin Goo meets the water.]

544
00:34:59,088 --> 00:35:02,334
[Jae Suk and Jin Goo- 7.5m.]

545
00:35:02,772 --> 00:35:06,250
[Already at 7.5m!
Putting other team members at a panic.]

546
00:35:09,419 --> 00:35:11,720
Wow, he's really brave.

547
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:22,218
- Wow, you really are something else.
- Weren't you scared?

548
00:35:22,516 --> 00:35:24,239
That was really fun.

549
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:28,685
[Feeling the pressure.]

550
00:35:28,686 --> 00:35:30,042
5m?

551
00:35:31,122 --> 00:35:33,918
If I were to jump the 7.5m,
then we'd have 15m.

552
00:35:34,377 --> 00:35:36,114
We'd get 15m if I jumped 7.5m.

553
00:35:36,115 --> 00:35:38,128
Then that would give us a huge lead.

554
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:42,362
[What will cowardly older brother choose?]

555
00:35:43,954 --> 00:35:47,608
[Blob Jump Team is also ready
to take their leap.]

556
00:35:53,714 --> 00:35:55,744
Blob Jump is scary.

557
00:35:55,745 --> 00:35:58,685
[Even the fearless Blank Ji is feeling nervous
to be getting back on the Blob Jump.]

558
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,650
This is no joke to be back up here again.

559
00:36:07,268 --> 00:36:10,327
[Bullet Blank Ji is getting into position.]

560
00:36:11,263 --> 00:36:13,578
This still scares me no matter
how many times I do it.

561
00:36:15,350 --> 00:36:17,259
- Which one are you going to jump, Jae Suk?
- What?

562
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:20,526
- Which one are you going to jump?
- I was going to jump the 5m...

563
00:36:20,527 --> 00:36:23,935
[Cowardly Jae Suk-
Will it be the 5m, or the 7.5m?]

564
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:25,759
Just jump the 5m!

565
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:29,050
You can totally jump the 7.5m.
It only lasts two seconds.

566
00:36:29,051 --> 00:36:30,455
[Carefully walks down the 7.5m board...]

567
00:36:32,621 --> 00:36:34,287
Just jump the 5m.

568
00:36:34,288 --> 00:36:36,304
You just need to endure two seconds.
The jump only lasts two seconds.

569
00:36:36,305 --> 00:36:38,118
Just close your eyes,
and endure two seconds.

570
00:36:38,856 --> 00:36:43,186
[You can do it, Jae Suk!
Jin Goo is trying to give Jae Suk the courage.]

571
00:36:45,494 --> 00:36:47,311
- Jumping this will give us 15m, right?
- Yes.

572
00:36:49,678 --> 00:36:52,905
[It's a battle with his own self...]

573
00:36:52,906 --> 00:36:54,397
- What are you doing?
- Jae Suk!

574
00:36:54,398 --> 00:36:56,515
What are you doing up there?

575
00:36:56,516 --> 00:36:59,367
You're not acting like yourself!
Just jump the 3m.

576
00:36:59,368 --> 00:37:01,800
Just give that up and get back down!

577
00:37:06,973 --> 00:37:08,669
Will you take this back down for me?

578
00:37:12,115 --> 00:37:14,055
I really hate heights.

579
00:37:14,056 --> 00:37:18,564
[I really hate being up high...
but the little brother is watching me...]

580
00:37:18,565 --> 00:37:19,776
Jae Suk.

581
00:37:24,402 --> 00:37:27,473
[One step...]

582
00:37:27,474 --> 00:37:31,534
[And another step...]

583
00:37:36,136 --> 00:37:38,413
Hey!
Put your glasses back on and come down!

584
00:37:38,414 --> 00:37:41,874
- Jae Suk! 5m is still plenty!
- 3m is calling your name!

585
00:37:41,875 --> 00:37:44,237
Why are you doing that?

586
00:37:44,238 --> 00:37:46,928
[Yoo Hyuk is going to jump the 7.5m?
A sight that's hard to believe...]

587
00:37:46,929 --> 00:37:51,699
- Just jump the 5m!
- Fighting!

588
00:37:52,796 --> 00:37:54,975
[He jumped!]

589
00:37:56,347 --> 00:37:57,615
Fighting!

590
00:38:14,247 --> 00:38:19,809
[He did it!
Yoo-ruce Willis!]

591
00:38:20,608 --> 00:38:22,074
[Very cool!]

592
00:38:26,963 --> 00:38:28,773
They're all crazy.

593
00:38:29,767 --> 00:38:31,450
I'm going to jump the 7.5m board.

594
00:38:33,802 --> 00:38:41,105
[The ultimate coward...
has now entered the regular coward status.]

595

[Still alive, right?]

596
00:38:57,731 --> 00:38:58,844
Hey.

597
00:39:00,025 --> 00:39:03,599
I felt like I was going to die.

598
00:39:04,519 --> 00:39:06,593
What are they doing up there?

599
00:39:07,117 --> 00:39:10,945
[Blob Jump-
Gary and Ji Hyo are ready to go!]

600
00:39:13,444 --> 00:39:14,729
One.

601
00:39:14,730 --> 00:39:15,931
Two.

602
00:39:15,932 --> 00:39:17,151
Three!

603
00:39:18,731 --> 00:39:21,167
[Jump!]

00:39:39,417 --> 00:39:42,114
[Wow!
An unbelievable height!]

607
00:39:51,887 --> 00:39:54,368
All I can hear are screams from everywhere.

608

[Screams heard from all over the place.
Welcome to 'Running Land'.]

- This is fun.
- Did you just say that this is fun?

610
00:40:00,384 --> 00:40:02,716
We need to hurry, Jin Goo.
We need to go over there.

611
00:40:02,717 --> 00:40:05,798
- Why aren't you guys doing anything?
- We're totally ruined now.

I think this is happening right now to
help me conquer my phobia of the water.

614
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:15,853

on the Blob Jump?]

00:43:38,702 --> 00:43:41,551
[Cutie Do Hee is attempting to
jump off the 1m diving board.]

651
00:43:52,699 --> 00:43:54,080
Do Hee, are you okay?

652
00:43:54,081 --> 00:43:56,357
- Are you okay?
- Yes, I'm okay.

653
00:43:57,033 --> 00:43:58,502
Come here.

654
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:04,487
This was a huge feat
that Do Hee just accomplished.

655
00:44:04,488 --> 00:44:07,937
[Even the 1m diving board was a huge feat
for Do Hee, who has a fear of the water.]

656
00:44:09,102 --> 00:44:10,986
- It's your turn.
- Okay, I'm going.

657
00:44:12,704 --> 00:44:17,261
[It's now the infamous scaredy cat,
Haroro's turn.]

658
00:44:17,262 --> 00:44:18,735
Why is it so high up here?

659
00:44:18,736 --> 00:44:22,665
[Monday Couple are standing side by side
up on the 5m diving board.]

660
00:44:22,666 --> 00:44:24,581
Didn't you jump off of that earlier?

661
00:44:24,582 --> 00:44:26,703
So how is this any higher?

662
00:44:26,704 --> 00:44:28,641
Can you jump with me?

663
00:44:29,271 --> 00:44:31,064
Let's just jump together, okay?

664
00:44:32,842 --> 00:44:35,488
- With our hands held together like this?
- You can't let go of my hand, okay?

665
00:44:35,489 --> 00:44:37,565
[Hand held couple diving?]

666
00:44:37,566 --> 00:44:39,291
Let's... go.

667
00:44:39,292 --> 00:44:43,345
Monday Couple, fighting!

668
00:44:43,603 --> 00:44:45,538
One.

669
00:44:46,005 --> 00:44:50,074
Two... wait, wait, Ji Hyo.

670
00:44:50,854 --> 00:44:52,440
I'm so scared.

671
00:44:52,441 --> 00:44:56,880
[Even if we're doing it together,
scary is still scary.]

672
00:44:57,117 --> 00:44:58,847
We don't have any time, Jae Suk.
Hurry up and take that off.

673
00:44:58,848 --> 00:45:01,021
- That's what I'm trying to do.
- Come on.

674
00:45:01,022 --> 00:45:03,683
[The teams are starting to rush each other
in their own desire to win the mission.]

675
00:45:04,472 --> 00:45:06,276
You can put the glasses back on
after you take the jacket off.

676
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:10,944
We have to hurry over to that other game.
The Flying Chair might take us a while.

677
00:45:10,945 --> 00:45:12,442
We just need to throw 8m.

678
00:45:13,922 --> 00:45:15,736
How am I going to jump off this thing?

679
00:45:15,737 --> 00:45:19,803
[This guy still isn't
mentally ready to jump...]

680
00:45:20,741 --> 00:45:25,644
[Kwang Soo is rushing to get himself
in position as the human bullet.]

681
00:45:29,442 --> 00:45:31,084
- Suk Jin!
- Yeah?

682
00:45:31,487 --> 00:45:32,849
Let's do this.

683
00:45:32,850 --> 00:45:34,392
Kwang Soo!

684
00:45:35,053 --> 00:45:36,480
Are you ready?

685
00:45:53,037 --> 00:45:55,672
We have to do this before they finish.
We have to hurry!

686
00:45:55,673 --> 00:45:56,988
[We were thinking that you were
being too ambitious...]

687
00:45:57,023 --> 00:45:58,340
Get up there quickly.

688
00:45:59,452 --> 00:46:01,159
22.5m?

689
00:46:01,449 --> 00:46:06,184
[Jong Kook and Si Wan's combined record
from the Flying Chair Basketball- 11m.]

690
00:46:06,185 --> 00:46:08,588
- If they have 22.m...
- They win if they each score 4m.

691
00:46:08,589 --> 00:46:11,728
- You're right.
- Should we both jump the 7.5m right now?

692
00:46:15,157 --> 00:46:18,400
If we add 15m to our current record,
then our total would be 26m.

693
00:46:19,580 --> 00:46:22,533
Maybe we should do the Blob Jump first?

694
00:46:23,104 --> 00:46:25,127
You want to go jump the 7.5m first?

695
00:46:25,128 --> 00:46:26,862
- Do that quickly?
- 7.5m.

696
00:46:29,189 --> 00:46:32,275
[Will it be the terrorizing diving first...]

697
00:46:32,276 --> 00:46:36,860
[Or will they do the Blob Jump first,
and dive the rest of what they need?]

698
00:46:36,861 --> 00:46:39,113
When are they going to be done here?
Are they done after this jump?

699
00:46:39,114 --> 00:46:41,321
- They're done after their one jump.
- Really? Then maybe we should wait.

700
00:46:41,911 --> 00:46:45,108
[One jump is all it would take, but
this is Kwang Soo we're talking about...]

701
00:46:46,578 --> 00:46:49,626
[Icon of misfortune is headed
to position himself again.]

702
00:46:53,596 --> 00:46:57,006
[Falls in the water
for the second time in a row.]

703
00:47:00,166 --> 00:47:02,170
Hey, what are you doing down there?

704
00:47:02,171 --> 00:47:04,014
Hurry up and get in position!

705
00:47:04,015 --> 00:47:06,651
- Come on, Kwang Soo.
- Hurry it up!

706
00:47:07,793 --> 00:47:09,341
How do I get up there?

707
00:47:09,342 --> 00:47:10,938
[You really are something else...]

708
00:47:11,715 --> 00:47:13,178
Should we go jump off the 7.5m first?

709
00:47:13,179 --> 00:47:14,833
- Should we do it?
- Yeah, let's do it.

710
00:47:18,733 --> 00:47:21,122
We're the cutest couple here.

711
00:47:21,833 --> 00:47:23,329
- Cutie pie!
- Cutie pie!

712
00:47:23,330 --> 00:47:25,853
- Cutie!
- Hurry up.

713
00:47:27,115 --> 00:47:29,317
- This is still scary.
- Fighting.

714
00:47:29,318 --> 00:47:32,845
- You're doing the 3m?
- That's all you're jumping?

715
00:47:32,846 --> 00:47:34,415
You guys go first.

716
00:47:35,456 --> 00:47:39,193
[Easy Brothers are finally done
prepping themselves for the Blob Jump.]

717
00:47:39,194 --> 00:47:40,465
Fighting!

718
00:47:43,877 --> 00:47:45,383
I'm scared!

719
00:47:48,329 --> 00:47:50,807
One, two, three.

720
00:47:56,063 --> 00:47:57,653
[Is it time to fly?]

721
00:48:02,179 --> 00:48:05,397
[Hello, Flying Squirrel.]

722
00:48:15,538 --> 00:48:18,698
[Kwang-Squirrel having lost his
sanity during his flight in the air.]

723
00:48:19,791 --> 00:48:23,058
[Suk Jin and Kwang Soo- 6.3m.]

724
00:48:23,619 --> 00:48:26,049
[Shocked Haroro prepares himself to dive.]

725
00:48:35,815 --> 00:48:39,362
[Adorable water splash
befitting of the 3m dive.]

726
00:48:40,276 --> 00:48:41,903
He did it.

727
00:48:43,496 --> 00:48:47,317
[A total of 4m-
The cutie couple is finally in the game.]

728
00:48:47,318 --> 00:48:48,632
What the heck!

729
00:48:50,454 --> 00:48:53,380
Someone jumped.
I just saw someone jump.

730
00:48:54,296 --> 00:48:57,374
[Jin Goo rushes off to check the scoreboard
after hearing the splash of someone diving.]

731
00:48:57,375 --> 00:48:59,083
Kwang Soo just jumped.

732
00:48:59,436 --> 00:49:00,986
6.3m.

733
00:49:04,571 --> 00:49:07,482
[Current first place holders are
suddenly feeling anxious.]

734
00:49:07,483 --> 00:49:09,330
- You go first, Jin Goo.
- Challenge.

735
00:49:10,504 --> 00:49:12,494
[Shoots without hesitation.]

736
00:49:19,231 --> 00:49:22,907
[Easy Brothers get an additional
6.3m from the Blob Jump.]

737
00:49:22,908 --> 00:49:24,236
We need another 11.3m.

738
00:49:24,237 --> 00:49:27,200
[Unable to do the addition...]

739
00:49:28,617 --> 00:49:33,475
[Suk Jin and Kwang Soo are currently in
second place with a total of 16.3m.]

740
00:49:33,476 --> 00:49:34,995
We need 13.7m.

741
00:49:34,996 --> 00:49:37,348
[Second place holders, Suk Jin and Kwang Soo
needs 13.7m more in order to win.]

742
00:49:39,056 --> 00:49:41,125
It's not that high up.
It's not as high up as we think it is.

743
00:49:41,126 --> 00:49:44,335
[Jong Kook and Si Wan are quickly
rushing to get ready for the 7.5m dive.]

744
00:49:44,708 --> 00:49:46,673
That's how high this really is.
It's not that high.

745
00:49:46,674 --> 00:49:49,094
It just feels like we're really high up
because of the water.

746
00:49:49,482 --> 00:49:50,800
Here I go.

747
00:49:57,106 --> 00:49:59,289
[Jumps without even hesitating?]

748
00:49:59,290 --> 00:50:01,749
[A really cool diving pose.]

749
00:50:09,898 --> 00:50:13,696
[Impressive dive befitting of
his rising star status.]

750
00:50:15,023 --> 00:50:19,788
[Si Wan gains the 7.5m.
Now, it's Mr. Capable's turn...]

751
00:50:21,578 --> 00:50:24,185
[Jong Kook and Si Wan move themselves
up to the second position.]

752
00:50:24,784 --> 00:50:26,910
[First place holders are
feeling the pressure.]

753
00:50:27,103 --> 00:50:29,828
[Will they score this time?]

754
00:50:37,528 --> 00:50:39,510
[Goal!]

755
00:50:41,282 --> 00:50:43,764
[A whopping 6m!]

756
00:50:43,765 --> 00:50:47,713
[Only 1.5m left to go to win!]

757
00:50:47,714 --> 00:50:49,827
It's right in front of us.

758
00:50:57,812 --> 00:51:00,433
We have to jump 7.5m.
We need 15m no matter what.

759
00:51:00,434 --> 00:51:04,475
[Suk Jin and Kwang Soo need 13.7m more.
They have to jump 7.5m each!]

760
00:51:05,850 --> 00:51:08,529
How am I going to jump the 7.5m?
How am I going to do this?

761
00:51:08,530 --> 00:51:13,226
[Kkuk is ready to dive
from the 7.5m platform.]

762
00:51:13,227 --> 00:51:18,905
[A bloody battle for the second position.
Jong Kook, Si Wan vs. Suk Jin, Kwang Soo.]

763
00:51:20,079 --> 00:51:23,251
[Jong Kook and Si Wan still have to
jump the Blob Jump.]

764
00:51:23,252 --> 00:51:24,952
- We have to jump before they do that.
- How are we going to do this?

765
00:51:24,953 --> 00:51:26,876
We have no other choice.

766
00:51:26,877 --> 00:51:28,427
Okay, here I go!

767
00:51:28,428 --> 00:51:31,558
[Mr. Capable has a fear of heights too...]

768
00:51:48,481 --> 00:51:49,836
Look at him.

769
00:51:49,837 --> 00:51:53,530
[Oh my goodness...]

770
00:51:55,356 --> 00:51:58,588
[Mr. Capable succeeds the 7.5m dive.]

771
00:52:00,452 --> 00:52:03,646
[Right on the heels of
the first place holders.]

772
00:52:04,148 --> 00:52:09,006
[Jae Suk and Jin Goo with 1.5m to go,
and Jong Kook and Si Wan with 4m.]

773
00:52:13,847 --> 00:52:18,761
[Please make the goal...]

774
00:52:18,762 --> 00:52:21,697
- It didn't make it?
- They're already at 28.5m.

775
00:52:21,698 --> 00:52:24,352
[Diving is all they have left to face.
If they can dive this, they can win it...]

776
00:52:24,900 --> 00:52:26,528
Come on, hurry.

777
00:52:26,529 --> 00:52:29,575
[But 7.5m isn't an easy height to jump from.]

778
00:52:30,788 --> 00:52:32,142
I'm going to lose it.

779
00:52:32,489 --> 00:52:35,110
[Jong Kook and Si Wan are rushing
to do the Blob Jump.]

780
00:52:36,881 --> 00:52:38,924
Come on, Kwang Soo.
Let's win the Best Couple Award.

781
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:42,454
- You think we can win the Best Couple Award?
- I think that we can.

782
00:52:42,750 --> 00:52:46,708
[This couple is already preparing themselves
to go after an award that's a year away...]

783
00:52:46,709 --> 00:52:49,702
[Kwang Soo is ready to jump
the 7.5m platform.]

784
00:52:52,039 --> 00:52:54,666
[Best Couple Award...]

785
00:52:54,667 --> 00:53:00,210
[The award is ours!]

786
00:53:03,650 --> 00:53:06,154
[Amazing! These cowardly Running Man members
are fearlessly going after it today!]

787
00:53:08,167 --> 00:53:10,853
[Kwang Soo immediately succeeds his dive!]

788
00:53:10,854 --> 00:53:12,539
You have to jump right now, Suk Jin!

789
00:53:13,522 --> 00:53:17,366
[The victory now rides on Suk Jin!]

790
00:53:23,921 --> 00:53:26,284
He just jumped the 7.5m.

791
00:53:26,285 --> 00:53:29,748
[Jae Suk and Jin Goo, who were in the lead,
are now at a chance of losing their win!]

792
00:53:33,206 --> 00:53:34,926
- He just jumped the 7.5m.
- We're in trouble. We have to hurry.

793
00:53:36,008 --> 00:53:38,101
What's the score right now?
Go take a look, Jin Goo.

794
00:53:41,295 --> 00:53:43,075
Oh my... oh my!

795
00:53:44,248 --> 00:53:46,792
Jong Kook and Si Wan only need
4m more to win.

796
00:53:46,793 --> 00:53:48,789
[They'll lose their first place spot
if they don't hurry!]

797
00:53:52,287 --> 00:53:56,032
[Come on, please...]

798
00:53:57,549 --> 00:53:59,400
[Misses the goal again!]

799
00:53:59,401 --> 00:54:00,656
[Crap!]

800
00:54:02,979 --> 00:54:04,686
- They only have 1.5m left to go.
- Let's hurry.

801
00:54:06,582 --> 00:54:09,794
[Jong Kook and Si Wan only need to jump
4m on the Blob Jump in order to win!]

802
00:54:10,606 --> 00:54:12,730
We have to jump before they do!
Suk Jin!

803
00:54:13,981 --> 00:54:19,555
[Big-nose... will he be able to jump?]

804
00:54:23,099 --> 00:54:25,385
Suk Jin!
You have to jump before they do!

805
00:54:25,386 --> 00:54:26,728
Suk Jin!

806
00:54:28,187 --> 00:54:29,678
No!

807
00:54:31,116 --> 00:54:34,359
[A fiery competition!]

808
00:54:38,660 --> 00:54:44,950
[Please, ball!]

809
00:54:50,119 --> 00:54:53,046
[Jong Kook and Si Wan are ready
for the jump!]

810
00:54:56,168 --> 00:55:00,118
[Big-nosed Brother!
He jumps the 7.5m!]

811
00:55:01,690 --> 00:55:10,671
[Just who... will... succeed first?]

812
00:55:23,264 --> 00:55:26,206
[Jae Suk and Jin Goo succeed
with the 3m goal!]

813
00:55:27,601 --> 00:55:30,334
[Jong Kook and Si Wan also succeeds
the Blob Jump!]

814
00:55:31,230 --> 00:55:33,846
[Big-nose also succeeds the 7.5m dive!]

815
00:55:35,082 --> 00:55:36,969
You made the goal!

816
00:55:42,256 --> 00:55:45,096
[Jong Kook and Si Wan clear the mission
with a 4.5m record.]

817
00:55:46,478 --> 00:55:48,669
[Suk Jin and Kwang Soo
also clear the mission.]

818
00:55:49,843 --> 00:55:53,954
[Easy Brothers, we really hope
that you win the Best Couple Award.]

819
00:55:55,944 --> 00:56:01,139
[Running Land Big Three-
All three teams succeed with the 30m.]

820
00:56:01,140 --> 00:56:05,408
[The problem now is figuring out
which team came in first.]

821
00:56:06,264 --> 00:56:08,222
Thus...

822
00:56:08,223 --> 00:56:09,678
The first place winners are...

823
00:56:10,444 --> 00:56:11,880
The first place winners are...

824
00:56:11,881 --> 00:56:17,510
[Which of the three teams cleared
the mission first?]

825
00:56:20,420 --> 00:56:22,757
Yoo Jae Suk and Yeo Jin Goo.

826
00:56:22,758 --> 00:56:25,708
Yoo Jae Suk and Yeo Jin Goo
are in first place.

827
00:56:28,758 --> 00:56:31,049
[By the split of a hair...]

828
00:56:37,801 --> 00:56:39,805
It was a five second difference.

829
00:56:39,806 --> 00:56:43,248
- With a total of 31.5m.
- 31.5m.

830
00:56:43,249 --> 00:56:48,785
And five seconds later, Ji Suk Jin and
Lee Kwang Soo came in with 31.3m.

831
00:56:48,786 --> 00:56:51,366
And two seconds later, in third place...

832
00:56:51,367 --> 00:56:54,498
Remember what I told you earlier about the
first place winners getting a huge advantage?

833
00:56:54,983 --> 00:56:58,273
First place winners can come out,
and take a look at their piece...

834
00:56:59,071 --> 00:57:03,624
and you can look at two other peoples' pieces
and choose to swap it out with theirs.

835
00:57:03,625 --> 00:57:06,602
Second place can winners can look at
one other person's piece

836
00:57:06,603 --> 00:57:08,072
and swap your piece out with theirs
should you choose to do so.

837
00:57:08,073 --> 00:57:13,217
And one person of the third place winners
can choose to do the same.

838
00:57:13,218 --> 00:57:18,693
First, one of the third place winners can come
and swap out their piece should you choose.

839
00:57:19,412 --> 00:57:21,756
[Si Wan is given the chance
to swap out his piece.]

840
00:57:24,227 --> 00:57:30,767
[A mental battle amongst the members.]

841
00:57:40,249 --> 00:57:42,151
[The final janggi piece status...]

842
00:57:42,152 --> 00:57:44,241
[Where do they stand now?]

843
00:57:45,114 --> 00:57:47,662
[The highly anticipated final mission.]

844
00:57:50,609 --> 00:57:57,343
[Just what is the final mission that
their fan, Irene, has in store for them?]

845
00:57:57,344 --> 00:58:00,478
[They'll start off with everyone separating.]

846
00:58:00,938 --> 00:58:04,033
- What is this?
- Come on, now.

847
00:58:04,827 --> 00:58:07,513
[What is this?]

848
00:58:08,300 --> 00:58:10,560
Where are you taking us?

849
00:58:10,936 --> 00:58:13,434
I've only seen this on TV.

850
00:58:14,108 --> 00:58:18,604
What is this now?
I know what I had in the beginning.

851
00:58:18,605 --> 00:58:22,554
[Just how did everyone's
janggi pieces change?]

852
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:27,220
What is this?

853
00:58:31,748 --> 00:58:37,848
[A large box, and the container holding
their janggi piece is in front of them.]

854
00:58:37,849 --> 00:58:39,802
I had the horse piece earlier.

855
00:58:44,192 --> 00:58:46,904
[Oh?]

856
00:58:46,905 --> 00:58:48,449
It has been switched.

857
00:58:51,805 --> 00:58:54,938
[Ha Ha had the General piece in the beginning.]

858
00:58:54,939 --> 00:58:58,837
[Ha Ha's piece has been switched too!]

859
00:58:58,838 --> 00:59:00,116
Mine's been switched out?

860
00:59:00,117 --> 00:59:03,045
Wow... here I thought I was
going to win.

861
00:59:05,665 --> 00:59:10,012
[The first place winning team member, Jin Goo,
with a chance to swap out the piece earlier.]

862
00:59:11,361 --> 00:59:15,055
[He swaps out his piece with Ha Ha's piece!]

863
00:59:17,359 --> 00:59:21,076
[Big-nose swaps his out with Kwang Soo's.]

864
00:59:25,096 --> 00:59:26,623
I have the horse.

865
00:59:28,438 --> 00:59:30,740
[Totally confused.]

866
00:59:31,792 --> 00:59:33,674
I had the horse earlier.

867
00:59:35,241 --> 00:59:37,322
[Si Wan's piece is still the same.]

868
00:59:40,293 --> 00:59:42,112
Soldier?
This is the soldier piece, right?

869
00:59:43,090 --> 00:59:44,754
So I'm a 'Soldier'?

870
00:59:50,054 --> 00:59:52,188
I'm the 'Cannon'.

871
00:59:52,189 --> 00:59:54,484
I took Kim Jong Kook's piece.

872
00:59:56,148 --> 00:59:58,456
[Jae Suk checks his own piece earlier...]

873
01:00:03,668 --> 01:00:05,718
[Jae Suk's piece was 'Soldier'.]

874
01:00:09,051 --> 01:00:13,178
[Since he came in at first place,
he has a chance to look at two pieces.]

875
01:00:13,179 --> 01:00:16,120
[He checks Jong Kook and Kwang Soo's pieces.]

876
01:00:19,971 --> 01:00:23,591
[Of all things,
they both have to be a 'Cannon'.]

877
01:00:24,268 --> 01:00:26,047
What other choice do I have?

878
01:00:26,609 --> 01:00:32,656
[Without much hesitation,
he swaps out his piece with Jong Kook's.]

879
01:00:36,543 --> 01:00:39,203
I'm sure that Kim Jong Kook is
pretty angry right now.

880
01:00:40,179 --> 01:00:42,013
Seriously.

881
01:00:43,326 --> 01:00:44,786
Private.

882
01:00:45,323 --> 01:00:47,497
Why are you saying that
in such a bratty voice?

883
01:00:47,821 --> 01:00:51,977
You could've said it in a nice voice,
but you said that like such a brat.

884
01:00:54,381 --> 01:01:04,041
[Red Team's General is none other than...
Yeo Jin Goo.]

885
01:01:06,026 --> 01:01:08,679
I'm the General.
General Yeo.

886
01:01:09,330 --> 01:01:11,306
Call me, General Yeo.

887
01:01:15,506 --> 01:01:17,469
This is the highest position?

888
01:01:19,170 --> 01:01:23,765
[Green Team's General is, Song Ji Hyo.]

889
01:01:23,766 --> 01:01:27,610
Please tell me what's going on.
I have no idea what we're doing.

890
01:01:27,611 --> 01:01:31,464
This is my first time seeing my piece,
while everyone has had a chance to see theirs

891
01:01:31,499 --> 01:01:33,850
and you're telling me that I'm the 'King'?
(King and General are the same in janggi.)

892
01:01:33,993 --> 01:01:36,572
- Is this an important piece?
- Yes, of course.

893
01:01:36,573 --> 01:01:38,602
Please open the large box.

894
01:01:38,603 --> 01:01:44,842
[Opens the box to reveal a green uniform,
and a mission envelope.]

895
01:01:51,055 --> 01:01:52,469
What are you doing?

896
01:01:52,470 --> 01:01:54,399
Why are you trying to upset me like that?

897
01:01:56,906 --> 01:01:59,810
[Green Team members change into
green team uniform.]

898
01:02:00,997 --> 01:02:04,804
['Cha/Cart'- Do Hee and Ha Ha.]

899
01:02:04,805 --> 01:02:07,936
['Ma/Horse'- Suk Jin and Si Wan.]

900
01:02:07,937 --> 01:02:13,259
['Po/Cannon'- Lee Kwang Soo and Yoo Jae Suk.]

901
01:02:13,260 --> 01:02:17,717
['Soldier'- Gary and Jong Kook.]

902
01:02:17,718 --> 01:02:24,052
['General'- Song Ji Hyo and Yeo Jin Goo.]

903
01:02:30,529 --> 01:02:32,076
It's a video message.

904
01:02:32,077 --> 01:02:34,187
[A video message in the mission phone.]

905
01:02:36,208 --> 01:02:38,815
<i>The game rules will be announced.</i>

906
01:02:38,816 --> 01:02:40,824
[The rules are relayed exactly as
Irene sent them.]

907
01:02:42,557 --> 01:02:44,839
<i>The game rules will be announced.</i>

908
01:02:46,208 --> 01:02:49,991
<i>Following the rules of
Hong Kong style chess games</i>

909
01:02:50,261 --> 01:02:53,680
<i>the ranking of the five chess pieces are...</i>

910
01:02:53,681 --> 01:02:58,808
<i>General, Cart, Horse, Cannon, and Soldier.</i>

911
01:03:00,658 --> 01:03:05,789
<i>The higher rank of one team can kill anyone
of the opposing team's lower rank.</i>

912
01:03:06,187 --> 01:03:08,909
And of course,
the same rank can kill each other.

913
01:03:08,910 --> 01:03:11,469
[Same rank can kill each other,
and a lower rank of the opposing team.]

914
01:03:11,470 --> 01:03:15,782
So the lower the rank,
the less people they can oust.

915
01:03:15,783 --> 01:03:17,141
So being a lower rank isn't good, right?

916
01:03:17,142 --> 01:03:20,577
So I guess my piece isn't that bad.
I'll oust whomever I can.

917
01:03:21,507 --> 01:03:26,851
<i>If someone of the lower rank ousts someone
of higher rank in the opposing team</i>

918
01:03:26,852 --> 01:03:29,025
<i>then it is deemed ineffective.</i>

919
01:03:29,902 --> 01:03:33,739
So I can oust another soldier,
but I can't oust anyone of higher rank?

920
01:03:33,740 --> 01:03:35,737
- So that's all I can do?
- Time pause?

921
01:03:35,738 --> 01:03:40,647
[Three second pause if they end up
ousting someone of the higher rank.]

922
01:03:41,005 --> 01:03:43,818
A special rule applies to soldiers.

923
01:03:43,819 --> 01:03:48,647
While they're lowest in rank,
they have the power to oust the General.

924
01:03:49,012 --> 01:03:51,984
They can oust their highest ranking opponent,
the General.

925
01:03:51,985 --> 01:03:54,350
[Lowest rank, the Soldier,
can oust the highest rank, the General.]

926
01:03:55,140 --> 01:03:57,584
[A soldier can oust the General!]

927
01:03:57,884 --> 01:04:01,101
- So only I can oust the King?
- No, the Kings can oust each other too.

928
01:04:01,837 --> 01:04:07,988
[Only another General or a Soldier
can oust a General.]

929
01:04:07,989 --> 01:04:09,651
Seriously.

930
01:04:10,397 --> 01:04:12,856
[Total regret mode.]

931
01:04:12,857 --> 01:04:15,555
Kim Jong Kook is the Soldier
on the opposing team.

932
01:04:16,365 --> 01:04:18,840
How do things like this
always happen in my life?

933
01:04:21,668 --> 01:04:23,248
What does that mean?

934
01:04:24,453 --> 01:04:28,820
<i>The Soldier or the General of one team
as to kill the General of the opposing team.</i>

935
01:04:29,313 --> 01:04:32,295
<i>The whole team will lose the mission
once their General is killed.</i>

936
01:04:33,855 --> 01:04:36,583
So once the General is killed,
then that whole team loses.

937
01:04:36,584 --> 01:04:40,101
[Just like in the game of janggi,
the game is over once the General is dead.]

938
01:04:40,102 --> 01:04:42,510
So the ones that I should be careful of...

939
01:04:42,804 --> 01:04:45,040
are the General and the Soldier.

940
01:04:45,402 --> 01:04:54,826
So it's important to protect the Soldier
while ousting members of the other team.

941
01:04:54,827 --> 01:04:56,261
[It's important to protect the Soldier to
oust the General of the opposing team.]

942
01:04:56,262 --> 01:05:02,531
[The two teams' Soldiers
play a very crucial role!]

943
01:05:04,234 --> 01:05:06,532
[Five seconds before the chase begins!]

944
01:05:06,533 --> 01:05:09,539
Since it'll take me less time to lay down
on the ground with my short stature...

945
01:05:09,539 --> 01:05:11,004
I think that'll give me an advantage.

946
01:05:14,377 --> 01:05:16,931
[Game start]

947
01:05:16,932 --> 01:05:17,964
Irene.

948
01:05:18,197 --> 01:05:20,028
This race is for you.

949
01:05:22,585 --> 01:05:28,179
[Letter from Hong Kong-
Janggi Chase- Start.]

950
01:05:30,273 --> 01:05:33,160
[Make way for General Yeo.]

951
01:05:36,011 --> 01:05:37,660
Oh my goodness.
Oh my goodness.

952
01:05:41,415 --> 01:05:44,498
[Nervousness escalates one hundredfold
going through the experience himself.]

953
01:05:49,131 --> 01:05:50,609
I'm scared.

954
01:05:51,892 --> 01:05:53,655
I have to conquer my own fear.

955
01:05:54,681 --> 01:05:56,840
[It's all over if I get ousted!
Even more burden for the General.]

956
01:05:56,841 --> 01:05:58,173
Do Hee!

957
01:05:59,856 --> 01:06:01,657
Are you the 'Cart'?

958
01:06:01,658 --> 01:06:05,276
- I can oust people.
- You're 'Cha', right?

959
01:06:05,732 --> 01:06:09,090
[Members of the same team are revealing
their own status to each other.]

960
01:06:09,091 --> 01:06:12,249
[Do Hee can oust anyone
other than the General.]

961
01:06:13,828 --> 01:06:17,736
[Meanwhile, Si Wan hasn't run across
any of his own team members yet.]

962
01:06:17,737 --> 01:06:19,827
<i>It would be so great if I were 'Cha'.</i>

963
01:06:19,828 --> 01:06:21,609
<i>At this rate, I'm going to get...</i>

964
01:06:22,251 --> 01:06:24,279
I don't think anyone's seen my piece.

965
01:06:27,626 --> 01:06:31,074
[Si Wan and Big-nose come face to face.]

966
01:06:31,712 --> 01:06:36,741
[They're the same status.
Able to attack each other.]

967
01:06:37,793 --> 01:06:39,825
What are you doing here by yourself?

968
01:06:40,343 --> 01:06:42,119
Why are you backing away?

969
01:06:43,876 --> 01:06:45,711
[Seeing how you're backing away,
you must be of the lower rank?]

970
01:06:45,712 --> 01:06:47,801
What's your rank, Si Wan?

971
01:06:47,802 --> 01:06:51,630
[It's three against one all of a sudden.]

972
01:06:57,133 --> 01:07:00,812
- Suk Jin's only 'Ma' position.
- I can oust Si Wan if you'll help me.

973
01:07:00,813 --> 01:07:02,010
That's what we can do.

974
01:07:03,611 --> 01:07:04,913
Si Wan!

975
01:07:06,555 --> 01:07:10,429
[Fast runner, Si Wan.]

976
01:07:10,955 --> 01:07:12,430
He's way too fast.

977
01:07:14,588 --> 01:07:17,133
Jong Kook's on our team.

978
01:07:20,700 --> 01:07:23,739
Why don't I see any of my own
team members?

979
01:07:26,315 --> 01:07:27,921
[Hey!]

980
01:07:27,922 --> 01:07:29,593
[Can attack.]

981
01:07:29,593 --> 01:07:33,785
[Can't attack.]

982
01:07:34,069 --> 01:07:36,520
[General Yeo on the attack!]

983
01:07:38,659 --> 01:07:39,813
Si Wan.

984
01:07:40,254 --> 01:07:42,271
[Wait...]

985
01:07:42,272 --> 01:07:45,267
[Seeing how aggressive he's being...]

986
01:07:45,268 --> 01:07:48,982
[Jin Goo must be of a higher rank.]

987
01:07:50,853 --> 01:07:52,775
Why don't you just surrender since
we're already in this position?

988
01:07:52,776 --> 01:07:54,486
[Si Wan's looking for a chance to escape.]

989
01:07:54,487 --> 01:07:56,862
[But Jae Suk appears out of nowhere
to block off his escape.]

990
01:07:57,706 --> 01:07:59,567
[Nowhere to run.]

991
01:08:02,303 --> 01:08:04,930
[Jin Goo with Si Wan's name tag in his hand!]

992
01:08:08,628 --> 01:08:10,311
I'm the first one ousted.

993
01:08:10,312 --> 01:08:12,972
Where in the world are my team members?

994
01:08:12,973 --> 01:08:15,776
[Green Team's 'Horse' is out.]

995
01:08:15,777 --> 01:08:17,378
Si Wan was a 'Horse'.

996
01:08:18,326 --> 01:08:20,488
Si Wan... is first one ousted again.

997
01:08:21,047 --> 01:08:26,335
[Si Wan was the first one ousted in
2012's Running Man vs Idols too.]

998
01:08:26,336 --> 01:08:28,997
Si Wan's such a fast runner,
so I don't know how you die so quickly.

999
01:08:28,998 --> 01:08:30,647
[Meet the 'Race Starter' of the Idols.]

1000
01:08:31,609 --> 01:08:33,752
[Im Si Wan- Out!]

1001
01:08:39,216 --> 01:08:43,689
<i>Im Si Wan, out.
Im Si Wan, out.</i>

1002
01:08:44,113 --> 01:08:46,641
Si Wan was the first one ousted
the last time he was on the show too.

1003
01:08:48,180 --> 01:08:49,889
Poor Si Wan.

1004
01:08:51,979 --> 01:08:53,592
[Come here.
Jong Kook is over there.]

1005
01:08:53,593 --> 01:08:57,076
[Blank Ji can sense his presence nearby.]

1006
01:08:58,925 --> 01:09:03,904
[She's trying to oust Jong Kook,
thinking that he's her opponent.]

1007
01:09:10,629 --> 01:09:14,083
[Blocks off his escape route first.]

1008
01:09:15,351 --> 01:09:17,227
[Huh?]

1009
01:09:17,228 --> 01:09:21,457
[But he's wearing a green uniform?]

1010
01:09:22,693 --> 01:09:24,732
[We're on the same team.]

1011
01:09:24,733 --> 01:09:27,101
- Don't lie to me.
- I'm not lying.

1012
01:09:28,104 --> 01:09:32,163
[Still unable to believe even after
seeing him in his green uniform.]

1013
01:09:33,495 --> 01:09:35,531
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, we're on the same team.

1014
01:09:36,209 --> 01:09:37,996
You really startled me.

1015
01:09:39,467 --> 01:09:41,406
[Kkuk bumped his knee in his haste
to hide from Blank Ji.]

1016
01:09:41,407 --> 01:09:43,624
- Then everyone's mistaken right now.
- Why?

1017
01:09:44,052 --> 01:09:46,520
- Everyone thinks you're on the Red Team.
- Really?

1018
01:09:47,108 --> 01:09:49,931
- The situation right now...
- What's your rank?

1019
01:09:49,932 --> 01:09:51,175
Tell me what your rank is.

1020
01:09:51,176 --> 01:09:52,749
I'm the General.

1021
01:09:52,750 --> 01:09:55,576
Then you and I are perfect to
stay together.

1022
01:09:55,577 --> 01:09:58,463
What's your position?
Are you the Soldier?

1023
01:10:02,510 --> 01:10:07,579
[Mr. Capable is the special Soldier.
Green Team just got a huge boost!]

1024
01:10:10,570 --> 01:10:13,370
I can grab them
and you can rip off the name tags.

1025
01:10:13,371 --> 01:10:14,673
[Mr. Capable to do the grabbing,
and Ace to do the ripping.]

1026
01:10:14,673 --> 01:10:16,084
That would be the best combo!

1027
01:10:16,085 --> 01:10:18,834
We have to start hunting.

1028
01:10:23,332 --> 01:10:25,363
[At the same time...]

1029
01:10:25,364 --> 01:10:27,491
Do Hee must be the General.

1030
01:10:27,988 --> 01:10:29,839
Green Team!

1031
01:10:31,278 --> 01:10:33,269
- Really?
- I don't know what Ha Ha is.

1032
01:10:34,432 --> 01:10:36,493
But since I'm the General...

1033
01:10:36,494 --> 01:10:38,421
should I go see what he is?

1034
01:10:39,396 --> 01:10:43,646
[General Yeo on the move again.]

1035
01:10:43,647 --> 01:10:45,279
Isn't Do Hee on our team?

1036
01:10:45,598 --> 01:10:47,026
No, Do Hee's on our team.

1037
01:10:47,027 --> 01:10:48,611
What about Jong Kook?

1038
01:10:48,612 --> 01:10:50,709
I haven't seen Jong Kook yet.

1039
01:10:51,289 --> 01:10:53,282
Whose team is Jong Kook on?

1040
01:10:53,283 --> 01:10:55,326
I think he's on your team.

1041
01:10:57,642 --> 01:11:03,987
[Wait... Jin Goo's coming toward me
without any fear?]

1042
01:11:03,988 --> 01:11:05,642
- You just stay there.
- Where are you going?

1043
01:11:06,138 --> 01:11:08,281
[Run!]

1044
01:11:08,282 --> 01:11:10,001
[Attack!]

1045
01:11:11,132 --> 01:11:14,143
[Quick witted Haroro makes his escape!]

1046
01:11:17,186 --> 01:11:19,835
[Gary comes out of his hiding to help!]

1047
01:11:21,622 --> 01:11:24,899
[Just then...]

1048
01:11:27,859 --> 01:11:30,516
[Kwang Soo springs an attack on Do Hee!]

1049
01:11:33,495 --> 01:11:36,298
[Haroro is captured!]

1050
01:11:38,852 --> 01:11:41,159
- I'm sorry, Do Hee. I have no other choice.
- Don't do this, Kwang Soo.

1051
01:11:41,160 --> 01:11:42,884
I'm going to start kicking.

1052
01:11:43,855 --> 01:11:47,230
[Ha Ha is in...]

1053
01:11:47,757 --> 01:11:49,807
[Ha Ha rips off Jin Goo's name tag!]

1054
01:11:50,809 --> 01:11:53,212
[And Kwang Soo rips off Do Hee's
name tag!]

1055
01:11:53,213 --> 01:11:56,764
[Pause]

1056
01:11:58,363 --> 01:12:00,144
Isn't this a 'Cart'?

1057
01:12:00,769 --> 01:12:05,216
<i>If someone of the lower rank removes
the name tag of someone of the higher rank</i>

1058
01:12:05,217 --> 01:12:06,888
<i>then it is ineffective.</i>

1059
01:12:06,889 --> 01:12:08,449
[Removing name tag of a higher rank is
ineffective as well as causing a time pause.]

1060
01:12:11,665 --> 01:12:15,245
[Three seconds to run.]

1061
01:12:15,246 --> 01:12:18,408
Three, two, one.

1062
01:12:18,443 --> 01:12:20,784
[Do Hee on the chase!]

1063
01:12:22,806 --> 01:12:26,376
[They all know each other's rank now!]

1064
01:12:26,377 --> 01:12:28,936
[Capture means they're ousted!]

1065
01:12:32,931 --> 01:12:34,760
[Yoo Hyuk makes his appearance!]

1066
01:12:34,761 --> 01:12:38,017
[Haroro is trapped without an escape!]

1067
01:12:41,427 --> 01:12:45,626
[General Yeo takes care of the situation.]

1068
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:52,624
[Ha Ha- out!]

1069
01:12:52,625 --> 01:12:55,539
[Green Team is in danger!]

1070
01:13:04,151 --> 01:13:06,268
[Jin Goo runs into his seniors who are in the
midst of filming their drama.]

1071
01:13:06,269 --> 01:13:10,268
[Yoon Seo Hyun and Wang Bit Na-
On the scene of 'Two Women's Room'.]

1072
01:13:12,477 --> 01:13:14,820
- Have you seen Kwang Soo?
- I haven't seen him. He's not in there.

1073
01:13:14,821 --> 01:13:16,552
It's too dark in there to even
see anything.

1074
01:13:17,087 --> 01:13:19,720
- What about Ji Hyo? Have you seen her?
- I think so, but I'm not sure.

1075
01:13:19,721 --> 01:13:21,554
Where's Ji Hyo?

1076
01:13:21,982 --> 01:13:25,200
- Not sure... over there, or there, or there?
- Come on.

1077
01:13:25,201 --> 01:13:27,422
- I'm not sure.
- I have to find Ji Hyo.

1078
01:13:28,196 --> 01:13:29,710
Goodbye.

1079
01:13:31,148 --> 01:13:33,271
Where in the world did she go?

1080
01:13:38,424 --> 01:13:40,214
[Someone is coming after his name tag!]

1081
01:13:40,215 --> 01:13:43,944
[It's actor, Yoon Seo Hyun, playing a prank!]

1082
01:13:46,273 --> 01:13:48,038
- Why are you doing this to me?
- So that's what it feels like.

1083
01:13:49,180 --> 01:13:50,578
That's fun.

1084
01:13:51,448 --> 01:13:53,771
[Mr. Yoon Seo Hyun with a knack
for variety shows.]

1085
01:13:55,035 --> 01:13:57,608
[Ten years shaved off of his life.]

1086
01:13:57,609 --> 01:13:59,680
Why did he have to be wearing
blue of all colors?

1087
01:14:07,539 --> 01:14:12,043
[Meanwhile, Jae Suk is searching
the opposite end of the building.]

1088
01:14:16,498 --> 01:14:20,412
[Discovers Kkuk.]

1089
01:14:21,415 --> 01:14:22,772
So this is where you've been.

1090
01:14:23,868 --> 01:14:25,800
- This is where you've been?
- What rank are you?

1091
01:14:25,801 --> 01:14:31,273
[These two people's fates have been
swapped by Jae Suk's hand.]

1092
01:14:31,274 --> 01:14:34,467
- I'm right above you, you say?
- Yeah, you're not that high in rank.

1093
01:14:35,108 --> 01:14:38,734
I may not be that high up in rank,
but I can still oust you from my position.

1094
01:14:39,965 --> 01:14:42,577
You must be eyeing my General, are you?

1095
01:14:42,578 --> 01:14:46,203
[Trying to gather
information from each other.]

1096
01:14:46,812 --> 01:14:49,917
- You're not much to look at either, are you?
- What did you just say?

1097
01:14:51,104 --> 01:14:54,915
[Oh? Jin Goo's hiding behind him?]

1098
01:14:54,916 --> 01:14:55,955
You're nothing to be afraid of.

1099
01:14:55,956 --> 01:14:57,777
<i>Jae Suk.</i>

1100
01:14:59,955 --> 01:15:03,089
Come on then.
I have nothing to be afraid of.

1101
01:15:03,565 --> 01:15:07,328
I'll just rip your tag off,
and keep pausing time.

1102
01:15:10,770 --> 01:15:13,243
Seeing the way you're standing there,
there must be someone hiding behind you.

1103
01:15:13,244 --> 01:15:17,755
[Jong Kook, with the power to oust the King.
Jae Suk tries to get Jin Goo to safety.]

1104
01:15:17,756 --> 01:15:20,300
Should I just put you out of your misery
and oust you right now?

1105
01:15:20,301 --> 01:15:21,880
Then come on and do it.

1106
01:15:21,881 --> 01:15:23,287
[Childish mind games.]

1107
01:15:25,687 --> 01:15:27,699
If you're not even going to do anything,
then just get out of here.

1108
01:15:28,948 --> 01:15:30,432
Stop just standing there.

1109
01:15:32,505 --> 01:15:35,899
[Just then,
Big-nose starts making his approach.]

1110
01:15:38,767 --> 01:15:40,517
[Wait...]

1111
01:15:40,518 --> 01:15:42,846
[If you and I gang up on him together...]

1112
01:15:42,846 --> 01:15:47,089
[Then perhaps we can oust
Jong Kook together?]

1113
01:15:47,090 --> 01:15:50,325
This really feels like a game of janggi.

1114
01:15:52,622 --> 01:15:55,491
You're acting like you've got
some tricks up your sleeve.

1115
01:15:56,233 --> 01:15:59,940
Even though we're playing it like this,
it's like we're playing a janggi board game.

1116
01:15:59,941 --> 01:16:01,151
Yes, you're right.

1117
01:16:01,152 --> 01:16:03,316
- Those are pretty good acting skills.
- Why?

1118
01:16:03,317 --> 01:16:04,777
You're acting like you've got
something up your sleeve.

1119
01:16:04,778 --> 01:16:08,917
- What do you mean, up my sleeve?
- You've got a weak trick behind you there.

1120
01:16:10,290 --> 01:16:13,195
- What do you mean, a weak trick?
- What did you just call me?

1121
01:16:13,196 --> 01:16:16,110
- What do you mean, a weak trick?
- I'm just calling it like I see it.

1122
01:16:16,111 --> 01:16:19,099
[They're closing in to capture the Soldier
who took a stab at their pride.]

1123
01:16:20,400 --> 01:16:23,552
[Want to see what we're capable of?]

1124
01:16:23,637 --> 01:16:27,392
- That's a pretty weak trick up your sleeve.
- We can oust him, right?

1125
01:16:27,393 --> 01:16:29,166
[Facing off in tight quarters.]

1126
01:16:29,624 --> 01:16:31,523
- Wait, Suk Jin.
- You won't get away with this.

1127
01:16:31,524 --> 01:16:33,277
[Huh?]

1128
01:16:33,278 --> 01:16:35,509
- I smell perfume.
- What perfume?

1129
01:16:35,510 --> 01:16:38,059
[Perfume?]

1130
01:16:38,060 --> 01:16:39,860
What perfume?
What perfume?

1131
01:16:39,861 --> 01:16:42,314
- What perfume are you talking about?
- I can smell Ji Hyo's perfume.

1132
01:16:42,315 --> 01:16:45,396
[Blank Ji really is behind the door!]

1133
01:16:46,207 --> 01:16:50,351
[Mr. Capable to lure them in,
and Ace to oust them.]

1134
01:16:52,416 --> 01:16:56,694
[Mr. Capable lures them into the room
just like they had planned!]

1135
01:16:58,675 --> 01:16:59,980
Wait, Suk Jin.

1136
01:17:00,790 --> 01:17:02,089
I smell perfume.

1137
01:17:02,090 --> 01:17:04,504
[But dog-nosed Yoo Hyuk detects
traces of Ji Hyo's perfume!]

1138
01:17:05,481 --> 01:17:08,501
[Ah... we almost had them!]

1139
01:17:08,502 --> 01:17:09,743
It's Ji Hyo!

1140
01:17:09,744 --> 01:17:12,497
[Desperate escape.]

1141
01:17:13,341 --> 01:17:16,221
[His infamous nose does it again!]

1142
01:17:21,419 --> 01:17:22,987
What's going on there?

1143
01:17:24,323 --> 01:17:28,644
[The Soldier is chasing them?]

1144
01:17:32,298 --> 01:17:34,039
What is going on here?

1145
01:17:36,051 --> 01:17:39,160
[But after their initial fleeing...]

1146
01:17:39,161 --> 01:17:41,675
- Why are we being chased by a Soldier?
- Why are we running away?

1147
01:17:42,195 --> 01:17:44,672
- Why are we being chased by a Soldier?
- Why are we escaping?

1148
01:17:44,673 --> 01:17:46,511
[They can't help but escape from Jong Kook.]

1149
01:17:48,220 --> 01:17:49,879
Blank Ji is coming.

1150
01:17:49,880 --> 01:17:51,788
[The ultimate combo duo.
General Blank Ji is right behind Jong Kook!]

1151
01:17:51,789 --> 01:17:56,287
[Making their escape for now since
they can't win against the General.]

1152
01:17:57,546 --> 01:18:01,674
[So close...]

1153
01:18:02,600 --> 01:18:06,562
I can't believe this is happening.
I never should've switched my piece with his.

1154
01:18:06,563 --> 01:18:08,936
You should've just left his piece alone
instead of making him the Soldier.

1155
01:18:08,937 --> 01:18:11,576
You should've kept your Soldier piece
so that you could attack the General.

1156
01:18:11,577 --> 01:18:14,806
Would you have kept the Soldier piece?
How could I have known this would happen?

1157
01:18:14,998 --> 01:18:17,569
I see what you're saying...
but this still shouldn't have happened.

1158
01:18:17,570 --> 01:18:19,806
- That was still the wrong thing to do.
- I'm going to lose my mind.

1159
01:18:19,807 --> 01:18:23,446
[To be chased by a Soldier is
driving them both out of their minds.]

1160
01:18:24,195 --> 01:18:26,668
Why is our team so weak when all
five members of our team are still alive?

1161
01:18:28,422 --> 01:18:30,702
[Let's gather our team together first.]

1162
01:18:33,270 --> 01:18:36,948
[No matter where they go,
they can't escape from the Tiger.]

1163
01:18:36,949 --> 01:18:38,100
Ji Hyo!

1164
01:18:38,868 --> 01:18:41,447
[General Blank joins in on the fray.]

1165
01:18:41,448 --> 01:18:44,614
[Grasshopper is caught in the jar!]

1166
01:18:46,144 --> 01:18:49,936
[Big-nose in the midst of his escape...
turns around to save Jae Suk?]

1167
01:18:51,674 --> 01:18:53,083
Grab him, Jong Kook.

1168
01:18:54,837 --> 01:18:56,770
[Jae Suk- Out!]

1169
01:18:57,622 --> 01:19:00,099
[What horrible timing!]

1170
01:19:06,957 --> 01:19:10,738
[Kills two birds with one stone.]

1171
01:19:13,883 --> 01:19:16,245
Our team just lost both
the 'Cart' and 'Cannon' piece.

1172
01:19:16,246 --> 01:19:18,363
We have to go get Do Hee.

1173
01:19:18,364 --> 01:19:21,655
[Mr. Capable and Ace Duo-
Ousts two opponents in the blink of an eye!]

1174
01:19:22,601 --> 01:19:24,396
What is this!

1175
01:19:30,820 --> 01:19:32,730
[Meanwhile]

1176
01:19:32,731 --> 01:19:36,252
[Where is Kwang Soo slinkering off to
while all this is happening?]

1177
01:19:37,945 --> 01:19:40,088
This is a drama filming set.

1178
01:19:41,010 --> 01:19:45,004
[This is the 'My Love From Another Star' set.]

1179
01:19:45,005 --> 01:19:46,861
I watch this drama all the time.

1180
01:19:47,612 --> 01:19:49,791
This is where dramas are filmed.

1181
01:19:49,792 --> 01:19:52,971
This place is like a second home to me.

1182
01:19:53,329 --> 01:19:58,099
[But why are you looking so excited?]

1183
01:20:04,078 --> 01:20:08,073
[Is he practicing his acting?]

1184
01:20:10,735 --> 01:20:14,337
Is this where Jeon Ji Hyun's room is?

1185
01:20:17,014 --> 01:20:20,102
Then Soo Hyun's room must be in here too.
Soo Hyun and I are really...

1186
01:20:20,668 --> 01:20:22,544
He and I are really close.

1187
01:20:23,166 --> 01:20:25,459
I talk to him in casual speech
all the time.

1188
01:20:26,466 --> 01:20:29,127
[That's because you're older than him.]

1189
01:20:32,554 --> 01:20:34,843
[Oh?]

1190
01:20:34,844 --> 01:20:37,973
[Just then, The Red Team closes in on him.]

1191
01:20:38,785 --> 01:20:40,557
- Are you all together?
- Are you by yourself right now?

1192
01:20:40,558 --> 01:20:43,176
[Gary, Jin Goo and Do Hee are all
closing in on him.]

1193
01:20:43,177 --> 01:20:46,513
- Can you give me a break?
- Why would we do that?

1194
01:20:47,220 --> 01:20:50,136
[Kwang Soo adamantly tries
to fight them off.]

1195
01:20:50,850 --> 01:20:55,639
[The only person that
Kwang Soo can oust here is Gary!]

1196
01:20:57,093 --> 01:21:01,265
[He can't even oust Jin Goo and Do Hee
because their ranks are higher than his.]

1197
01:21:01,266 --> 01:21:02,644
I don't want to get ousted here!

1198
01:21:04,689 --> 01:21:06,501
Oust him right now before anyone comes!

1199
01:21:07,474 --> 01:21:08,812
Jong Kook!

1200
01:21:12,454 --> 01:21:14,413
[Just then]

1201
01:21:19,665 --> 01:21:21,294
No!

1202
01:21:22,690 --> 01:21:24,069
You did good.

1203
01:21:24,070 --> 01:21:27,407
- Let's go.
- Who knew that this would happen?

1204
01:21:27,408 --> 01:21:29,103
Did you rip off his name tag?

1205
01:21:29,104 --> 01:21:30,817
Can I take this home with me?

1206
01:21:32,037 --> 01:21:35,526
[Happy-go-lucky Jin Goo takes
the name tag as a keepsake.]

1207
01:21:36,298 --> 01:21:37,908
You're really strong.

1208
01:21:37,909 --> 01:21:40,786
I can't believe he lasted that long
even with all three of us attacking him.

1209
01:21:41,877 --> 01:21:45,465
[Kwang Soo got ousted while playing
'Drama' all by himself...]

1210
01:21:51,234 --> 01:21:53,530
[Players left remaining-
Red Team: 3 vs Green Team: 2.]

1211
01:21:54,131 --> 01:21:58,307
[But the survivors of the Green Team
are Mr. Capable and Ace Ji Hyo.]

1212
01:21:58,308 --> 01:22:01,804
[No matter how many opponents are left alive,
this is no easy duo to defeat.]

1213
01:22:09,648 --> 01:22:11,370
[At last...]

1214
01:22:11,371 --> 01:22:14,251
[All the survivors are about to
come face to face.]

1215
01:22:24,847 --> 01:22:26,500
What if Ji Hyo's hiding around here
somewhere?

1216
01:22:26,501 --> 01:22:29,053
[Extreme state of nervousness.]

1217
01:22:32,239 --> 01:22:34,246
This could've turned out really bad.

1218
01:22:37,741 --> 01:22:39,302
Do Hee's not the General, right?

1219
01:22:40,131 --> 01:22:41,628
Do Hee's not the General.

1220
01:22:42,041 --> 01:22:43,798
[Guys...]

1221
01:22:43,799 --> 01:22:51,131
[You remember the plan, right?]

1222
01:22:51,132 --> 01:22:52,326
Listen to me carefully.

1223
01:22:52,327 --> 01:22:54,802
This is what I've learned from playing
this game these past few years.

1224
01:22:55,192 --> 01:22:58,956
Jong Kook is going to avoid Do Hee,
and come after you and I.

1225
01:22:58,957 --> 01:23:03,148
And while he has us in his grasp,
Ji Hyo's going to try to eliminate us.

1226
01:23:03,710 --> 01:23:05,402
That's the chance you have to attack.

1227
01:23:05,403 --> 01:23:06,984
That's hard.

1228
01:23:07,968 --> 01:23:10,515
We have to try to hold out
no matter what we have to do.

1229
01:23:10,516 --> 01:23:13,884
Ji Hyo's going to come after us to try to
oust us, and she'll be after you especially.

1230
01:23:13,885 --> 01:23:16,356
That's the chance we have to wait for.
You and I have to both watch out for it.

1231
01:23:16,357 --> 01:23:18,123
Don't think about ousting Jong Kook.

1232
01:23:18,384 --> 01:23:20,651
- Who are you after?
- Ji Hyo.

1233
01:23:20,652 --> 01:23:22,435
- And what about you?
- Jong Kook.

1234
01:23:22,436 --> 01:23:24,649
[Jin Goo to go after Ji Hyo,
and Do Hee to go after Jong Kook.]

1235
01:23:25,738 --> 01:23:30,309
[It's time.]

1236
01:23:30,310 --> 01:23:33,537
[Guys... you have to stay focused.]

1237
01:23:33,538 --> 01:23:39,272
[Just like I've trained you...]

1238
01:23:41,612 --> 01:23:46,088
[It's time for the inevitable...]

1239
01:23:46,089 --> 01:23:49,938
[But they see enraged Kwang Soo
is being led away to jail.]

1240
01:23:51,171 --> 01:23:54,708
[During this crucial moment...]

1241
01:23:56,948 --> 01:23:58,928
You shouldn't have been
walking around by yourself.

1242
01:23:59,654 --> 01:24:02,242
[Why didn't you come help me!]

1243
01:24:05,442 --> 01:24:07,454
This is fate playing a cruel joke on us.

1244
01:24:08,116 --> 01:24:10,190
The way I see it, Ji Hyo's the General.

1245
01:24:10,191 --> 01:24:13,119
- No, the way I see it...
- If I have to eliminate you...

1246
01:24:14,347 --> 01:24:17,579
Please understand what I'm about to do.
This will be going down in history.

1247
01:24:17,580 --> 01:24:20,700
[Please understand if I eliminate you.
This will be an event for the books.]

1248
01:24:20,701 --> 01:24:25,167
[Will it be the Green Team...
or the Red Team?]

1249
01:24:25,168 --> 01:24:28,615
[Time to determine the victors.]

1250
01:24:32,085 --> 01:24:35,686
[Okay, what we've been trained to do...]

1251
01:24:35,687 --> 01:24:37,819
[Mr. Capable's stance
that Gary told us about...]

1252
01:24:37,820 --> 01:24:41,106
[That's the stance he was talking about.]

1253
01:24:41,107 --> 01:24:47,012
[Just like we practiced...]

1254
01:24:47,013 --> 01:24:51,034
[Let's do this!]

1255
01:24:51,632 --> 01:24:53,414
[Attack]

1256
01:24:56,092 --> 01:24:57,926
That should've been me.

1257
01:24:59,322 --> 01:25:01,672
[Are you jealous of my position?]

1258
01:25:01,673 --> 01:25:05,036
Can we switch our spots?
I really want to be in his spot.

1259
01:25:06,592 --> 01:25:10,070
[Time to determine the ultimate winner!]

1260
01:25:17,190 --> 01:25:18,212
I'll go after Jong Kook.

1261
01:25:18,213 --> 01:25:27,481
[I have to take care of Jong Kook.]

1262
01:25:27,482 --> 01:25:29,866
[Time to move in.]

1263
01:25:39,266 --> 01:25:42,064
[Jin Goo quickly pulls his body away
to escape Blank Ji's attack.]

1264
01:25:43,832 --> 01:25:46,832
[The two Kings are facing off
against one another!]

1265
01:25:46,833 --> 01:25:52,302
[Green vs Red.
A bloody battle between the Generals.]

1266
01:25:55,065 --> 01:25:57,655
[Do Hee's got her target locked down.]

1267
01:25:58,695 --> 01:26:01,291
[Just then...]

1268
01:26:04,380 --> 01:26:07,802
[Gary springs an ambush attack
on Blank Ji!]

1269
01:26:12,646 --> 01:26:14,696
[Soldier Gary...]

1270
01:26:14,697 --> 01:26:19,704
[Ousts General Blank!]

1271
01:26:21,051 --> 01:26:23,215
[Signs of a fierce battle.]

1272
01:26:24,831 --> 01:26:29,496
[Could this victory be credited
to their earlier training?]

1273
01:26:35,640 --> 01:26:37,214
We won.

1274
01:26:38,921 --> 01:26:41,323
[Red Team wins!]

1275
01:26:43,630 --> 01:26:46,465
- You did it!
- Gary did it!

1276
01:26:47,692 --> 01:26:51,600
The game that we played today was really
an amazing idea by our Hong Kong fan.

1277
01:26:51,601 --> 01:26:55,096
[Today's race was carried out exactly as
created by their fan in Hong Kong.]

1278
01:26:55,097 --> 01:27:01,128
[Extremely fair... and enjoyable race.]

1279
01:27:01,129 --> 01:27:04,072
[Thank you, Irene.]

1280
01:27:05,728 --> 01:27:09,342
- There wasn't a single flaw in the race.
- Is the victory ours?

1281
01:27:09,343 --> 01:27:11,065
Please bring out the prize.

1282
01:27:11,066 --> 01:27:15,076
- I feel so bad for Si Wan.
- I can't believe our team lost.

1283
01:27:17,596 --> 01:27:22,687
[A young woman,
timidly walking out onto the set...]

1284
01:27:23,514 --> 01:27:25,176
Wait, that's...

1285
01:27:25,712 --> 01:27:30,434
[Wait... that young lady is...]

1286
01:27:30,932 --> 01:27:35,560
<i>I'm a big fan of Running Man from Hong Kong,
and I always have a lot of ideas for the show.</i>

1287
01:27:38,246 --> 01:27:42,594
[She's standing right in front of us!]

1288
01:27:44,196 --> 01:27:46,255
You're absolutely beautiful in person!

1289
01:27:46,256 --> 01:27:49,736
[A shocking appearance that
none of them were expecting.]

1290
01:27:49,737 --> 01:27:52,033
- I can't believe that you're here!
- How did you even get here?

1291
01:27:52,786 --> 01:27:55,154
[The truth is...]

1292
01:27:55,883 --> 01:27:57,666
- Thank you so much, Irene.
- Thank you.

1293
01:27:57,667 --> 01:28:01,410
[All day today...]

1294
01:28:01,816 --> 01:28:07,369
[She's been watching all the Running Man
cast members from the sidelines.]

1295
01:28:07,370 --> 01:28:09,961
[Wow, it's Ji Hyo!]

1296
01:28:10,679 --> 01:28:12,869
- Does that really hurt?
- Yeah, it hurts.

1297
01:28:12,870 --> 01:28:20,406
[Fascinated by seeing them in person...
and truly enjoying the whole experience.]

1298
01:28:25,952 --> 01:28:30,929
[While watching her idea come to life...]

1299
01:28:30,930 --> 01:28:34,374
[Feeling the excitement,
and joy at the same time.]

1300
01:28:35,152 --> 01:28:36,396
Hello.

1301
01:28:37,074 --> 01:28:39,074
My name is Irene.

1302
01:28:39,694 --> 01:28:41,315
It's very nice to meet you.

1303
01:28:41,316 --> 01:28:45,370
[Thank you for your love and support,
and it's nice to meet you, Irene!]

1304
01:28:45,371 --> 01:28:46,980
Very good, fantastic!

1305
01:28:48,366 --> 01:28:50,661
