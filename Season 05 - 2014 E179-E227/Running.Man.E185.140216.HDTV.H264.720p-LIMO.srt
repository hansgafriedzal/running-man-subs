[Hanyang- 400 years ago.]

11
00:01:25,157 --> 00:01:28,161
What are we doing today that you
would have us dressed like this?

12
00:01:29,598 --> 00:01:32,496
Do you remember your life
from back in the 1600's?

13
00:01:32,497 --> 00:01:34,735
- Yes, I do remember.
- Oh, wow.

Why?
Why do you ask?

- Why do you look so surprised?
- You don't think this question is odd?

Yes, I know it's a bit odd...
but yes, I do remember.

00:01:42,996 --> 00:01:47,121

[Year 1614-
King Gwanghae is currently in reign.]

19
00:01:50,862 --> 00:01:54,411
No, Seonjo is not in reign.
Yes, I think I know the year we're in.

20
00:01:54,956 --> 00:01:57,093
I can sense that Spring is near.

21
00:01:57,094 --> 00:02:00,856
Even though Spring is near,
but my heart...

22
00:02:01,219 --> 00:02:03,784
My heart is still feels cold
like a block of ice.

23
00:02:03,785 --> 00:02:08,163
Where could my love be right now?

24
00:02:08,164 --> 00:02:11,073
Could my love be shivering from the coldness
in her heart like I am right now?

25
00:02:17,251 --> 00:02:18,603
I will not...

26
00:02:18,906 --> 00:02:21,665
I will not take her into my bed!

27
00:02:22,834 --> 00:02:25,529
[What are you doing?]

28
00:02:29,347 --> 00:02:31,965
Everyone...
did I shock you with my performance?

29
00:02:33,354 --> 00:02:34,930
That was just my acting.

30
00:02:36,035 --> 00:02:37,942
<i>You can stop your acting now.</i>

31
00:02:37,943 --> 00:02:40,940

good historical drama in the near future.]

00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,639
[Scholar Kkuk- Resembling more of a General
with his big stature.]

00:02:53,404 --> 00:02:55,938
Find the jade hairpin.

36
00:02:56,942 --> 00:02:59,915

<i>Find the jade hairpin.</i>

41
00:03:17,371 --> 00:03:20,764
<i>But if your identity tag gets taken away
from you, you'll have to come to a cease?</i>

42
00:03:20,764 --> 00:03:22,138
This tag?

43
00:03:22,968 --> 00:03:24,733
That is your identity tag.

44
00:03:24,734 --> 00:03:27,385
[Name tag of the Joseon era.]

45
00:03:27,386 --> 00:03:29,050
Is there something back there?

46
00:03:29,051 --> 00:03:30,596
Is this the identity tag?

47
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:36,068
We have to come to a halt if this is taken
away from us before we find the jade pin?

48
00:03:36,586 --> 00:03:39,723
I have a feeling that a game similar to this
is going to become popular in the future.

49
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:43,918
[Then could this be where the name tag
elimination game originated from?]

50
00:03:45,948 --> 00:03:48,153

village somewhere?

somewhere within this village.]

Is no one out there?

54
00:04:01,177 --> 00:04:03,578
Where has everyone gone off to?

55
00:04:03,579 --> 00:04:08,084
<i>Let's see here.
Where is that jade hairpin hidden?</i>

56
00:04:08,097 --> 00:04:14,172
[Just as it was stated...
they must find the hairpin in Hanyang.]

57
00:04:15,878 --> 00:04:20,039
A noble gentleman is supposed to stately walk
around with his hands behind his back.

58
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:23,271
[Must say goodbye to his gentle disposition
for the sake of accomplishing the mission.]

59
00:04:26,864 --> 00:04:29,504
The size of these face cutouts are
perfect for Ji Hyo and I.

60
00:04:29,937 --> 00:04:32,110
Don't you think that this cutout is
the perfect size for my face?

61
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,712
See?
My face fits perfectly in here.

62
00:04:34,713 --> 00:04:36,504
[A perfect fit.]

63
00:04:36,505 --> 00:04:38,786
If we had met 400 years ago...

64
00:04:38,787 --> 00:04:41,060
we really could've been something special.

65
00:04:45,692 --> 00:04:47,023
Isn't that a jade hairpin?

66
00:04:48,135 --> 00:04:49,749
Excuse me.

67
00:04:53,074 --> 00:04:59,038
<i>[But... the jade hairpin must have
the letter 'R' engraved on it.]</i>

68
00:04:59,657 --> 00:05:01,247
Isn't this a jade hairpin?

69
00:05:01,248 --> 00:05:03,425
- It's a cheap knockoff.
- A cheap knockoff?

70
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:07,421
[That's not the jade hairpin you want...]

71
00:05:08,824 --> 00:05:13,355
[Now that they take a closer look,
jade hairpins are seen all over the place!]

72
00:05:15,549 --> 00:05:16,786
Wait.

73
00:05:16,787 --> 00:05:19,976
I'm just a passerby,
but can I check your hairpin?

74
00:05:19,977 --> 00:05:22,337
Wait.
Can I check out your hairpin?

75
00:05:22,338 --> 00:05:25,315
[Gentle nobleman or not,
main priority is to find the jade hairpin.]

76
00:05:25,316 --> 00:05:26,984
No, it's not it.

77
00:05:27,597 --> 00:05:29,167
I apologize.

78
00:05:30,774 --> 00:05:32,547
I won't ever forget you.

79
00:05:34,155 --> 00:05:35,910
Ahoy there, Scholar Blank.

80
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:39,134
Why are you laying your hands on a
delicate woman's body like that?

81
00:05:39,135 --> 00:05:42,656
- What are you talking about?
- You're a total scoundrel.

82
00:05:42,657 --> 00:05:45,373
[Scholar Blank is chastising Scholar Yoo
for laying his hand on a woman's body.]

83
00:05:45,374 --> 00:05:51,605
What kind of a noble scholar are you to walk
around with your hair so red like that?

84
00:05:51,725 --> 00:05:54,129
- This is my personal style.
- Are you out of your mind?

85
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:56,091
Do not cast an amorous glance
at just any women.

86
00:05:56,092 --> 00:05:57,376
- How dare you.
- How dare you!

87
00:05:57,377 --> 00:06:01,063
Do you think that every women out here
likes you or something?

88
00:06:01,146 --> 00:06:04,269
- What are you talking about?
- You're walking around smiling at everyone.

89
00:06:05,417 --> 00:06:08,412
- This is what you're walking around doing.
- When did I ever do that with my eyes?

90
00:06:08,412 --> 00:06:12,461
- Look at you. You're nothing but trouble.
- You need to be more careful with your words.

91
00:06:12,462 --> 00:06:15,190
- You are a troublemaker!
- You watch yourself!

92
00:06:15,191 --> 00:06:18,173
- Don't even act like you know me.
- All you women, be aware!

93
00:06:18,174 --> 00:06:20,988
- You need to watch yourself.
- Yoo Jae Suk is on the loose!

94
00:06:22,311 --> 00:06:24,204
I really feel like I'm back in
the Joseon era.

95
00:06:24,867 --> 00:06:28,223
What's 'Ok-bineoh'? (Jade hairpin).
Who has an ok-bineoh'?

96
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:33,602
How can that be?
There's a yellow haired person over there.

97
00:06:37,261 --> 00:06:40,192
Excuse me...
but where do you hail from?

98
00:06:40,193 --> 00:06:42,477
- He's asking where you're from.
- Australia.

99
00:06:42,478 --> 00:06:44,197
Australia?

100
00:06:44,198 --> 00:06:46,084
I love Australia.

101
00:06:47,158 --> 00:06:49,978
This is so fascinating?
Are those things to keep your ears warm?

102
00:06:49,979 --> 00:06:51,460
Yes, they are.

103
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:54,565
Fantastic.

104
00:07:02,221 --> 00:07:04,539
I'm sorry, Jong Kook!
Jong Kook, I'm so sorry!

105
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:07,439
- Just hold still.
- Yes, I'll just hold still.

106
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,751
[Even though the times may have changed,
the order in the food chain never changes.]

107
00:07:10,752 --> 00:07:14,467
- Let's go find the jade hairpin.
- Yes, I understand.

108
00:07:14,946 --> 00:07:16,907
I dedicate my life to you in servitude!

109
00:07:16,908 --> 00:07:21,419
- Where shall we go?
- I think that it's on a person.

110
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:23,494
- Quick, aren't I?
- Yes, you're very quick.

111
00:07:23,495 --> 00:07:28,430
- Okay, let's go start looking.
- Yes, but if you'll let go of me...

112
00:07:28,431 --> 00:07:32,597
No, I have this odd feeling that you and I
are somehow meant to be together like this.

113
00:07:32,598 --> 00:07:34,519
- No, we're not.
- Look, there's a hairpin.

114
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:37,711
[Just then, they see a jade hairpin!]

115
00:07:37,712 --> 00:07:39,669
- We need to walk in a more leisurely fashion.
- Excuse me.

116
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:42,528
- Is that a jade hairpin?
- My lady!

117
00:07:42,529 --> 00:07:45,447
- Please excuse me.
- Hello.

118
00:07:45,937 --> 00:07:48,113
I never knew that such a fine lady
lived in this village.

119
00:07:48,114 --> 00:07:51,736
- I had no idea.
- Can we take a look at your hairpin?

120
00:07:54,468 --> 00:07:56,132
Is that a real jade hairpin?

121
00:07:56,133 --> 00:07:59,048
- Allow me to take out your hairpin.
- Is this hairpin made of jade?

122
00:08:01,578 --> 00:08:06,153
[Scholar Kkuk pulls out the Lady's hairpin
as if pulling off a name tag.]

123
00:08:06,487 --> 00:08:08,523
- Please excuse me.
- Allow me to apologize in his place.

124
00:08:08,524 --> 00:08:10,437
[Please excuse Scholar Kkuk's rudeness.]

125
00:08:10,438 --> 00:08:12,795
[No marking of the letter 'R'.]

126
00:08:14,062 --> 00:08:16,169
It's a village celebration!

127
00:08:18,383 --> 00:08:20,165
Watch yourself!

128
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,943
Join me in the celebration!

129
00:08:22,218 --> 00:08:25,225
[His dance moves are about 400 years
ahead of their time.]

130
00:08:25,226 --> 00:08:27,453
Come on, join me!
This is a celebration!

131
00:08:28,589 --> 00:08:30,544
This is a celebration!

132
00:08:33,431 --> 00:08:36,483
[It... fell off...]

133
00:08:38,783 --> 00:08:41,059
Why did you have to dance like that?

134
00:08:41,162 --> 00:08:44,391
- What are you doing?
- It's because you moved!

135
00:08:44,426 --> 00:08:47,071
- But that was...
- That pulled off real easily.

136
00:08:47,659 --> 00:08:50,280
- I can't believe it snapped off like that.
- What are you doing? Put it back!

137
00:08:51,123 --> 00:08:53,136
- I didn't mean to do that.
- Jong Kook!

138
00:08:53,137 --> 00:08:55,387
- I'm serious.
- How could you do this to me?

139
00:08:55,504 --> 00:09:00,046
[So things were exactly the same
even 400 years ago...]

140
00:09:00,047 --> 00:09:01,477
I really didn't mean to do that.

141
00:09:01,478 --> 00:09:05,390
I was just holding it, and it broke off.
I didn't know it was that flimsy.

142
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,035
Am I really out?

143
00:09:09,749 --> 00:09:11,541
Is it really over for me now?

144
00:09:15,654 --> 00:09:17,709
I'm going to get my revenge!

145
00:09:18,037 --> 00:09:20,644
Even though it may be over for me
like this in this lifetime...

146
00:09:20,854 --> 00:09:22,611
I vow...

147
00:09:22,941 --> 00:09:26,946
I vow to get my revenge
against that lowlife scoundrel!

148
00:09:26,947 --> 00:09:30,093
[Thus, Scholar Kwang Soo's story
comes to an end...]

149
00:09:30,587 --> 00:09:33,673
[Meanwhile]

150
00:09:33,674 --> 00:09:36,423
Pardon me, but I need to check
your hairpin.

151
00:09:36,424 --> 00:09:38,848
Will you please allow me to do that?

152
00:09:38,849 --> 00:09:40,315
Come hither.

153
00:09:42,276 --> 00:09:43,986
I need to check your hairpin.

154
00:09:43,987 --> 00:09:45,615
No, this one isn't marked.

155
00:09:45,616 --> 00:09:47,175
I'm sorry for the intrusion.

156
00:09:47,176 --> 00:09:48,981
Please excuse me.

157
00:09:48,982 --> 00:09:51,829
I must hurry and find the
jade hairpin.

158
00:09:55,799 --> 00:09:58,250
[Elegant stature.]

159
00:10:08,928 --> 00:10:11,021
No, I don't think this is it.
Wait, you're...

160
00:10:11,551 --> 00:10:14,585
[Wait, this young woman is...]

161
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:16,295
<i>Are you...</i>

162
00:10:17,653 --> 00:10:20,265
<i>the Grim Reaper?</i>

163
00:10:20,266 --> 00:10:23,433
[Even though she captured the heart of
Do Min Joon 400 years ago...]

164
00:10:23,434 --> 00:10:33,630
[She tragically had to say
her goodbye in the end.]

165
00:10:37,517 --> 00:10:38,662
Come here.

166
00:10:38,663 --> 00:10:41,210
[Quickly pulls her away in hiding to keep her
from being discovered by the others.]

167
00:10:43,423 --> 00:10:46,184
Song Yi!
What are you doing here, Song Yi?

168
00:10:46,185 --> 00:10:48,342
Song Yi!
I can't believe that it's you!

169
00:10:48,343 --> 00:10:50,225
Do you know how much I love you
in the drama?

170
00:10:50,226 --> 00:10:53,705
- Are you cold? Here, wear this.
- I feel cold.

171
00:10:53,706 --> 00:10:55,757
You have no idea how much I enjoyed
watching you in the drama.

172
00:10:55,758 --> 00:11:00,020
- I bet you're cold. I'm a huge fan of yours.
- Thank you.

173
00:11:02,191 --> 00:11:06,238
Please find a palanquin for me to hide in
so that I may escape out of here.

174
00:11:06,239 --> 00:11:07,704
You need a palanquin?

175
00:11:07,705 --> 00:11:12,011
[Escape? A palanquin?]

176
00:11:12,012 --> 00:11:13,272
<i>I will...</i>

177
00:11:16,624 --> 00:11:18,382
<i>protect you.</i>

178
00:11:18,383 --> 00:11:21,936
[I will protect you.]

179
00:11:21,937 --> 00:11:24,731
We need to find a palanquin.
Where shall we go?

180
00:11:24,732 --> 00:11:29,202
Come on, let's go.
I'm such a huge fan. Let's take a picture.

181
00:11:29,752 --> 00:11:31,832
Can I take a picture of us together?

182
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:33,444
Yes, you may.

183
00:11:33,445 --> 00:11:36,435
- Where's the palanquin?
- I do not know that either.

184
00:11:36,436 --> 00:11:38,356
[Could Scholar Ha be her protector
like Do Min Joon was?]

185
00:11:38,357 --> 00:11:42,782
[Or... is he like an older fan of hers?]

186
00:11:42,783 --> 00:11:44,468
Okay, we need to stay cautious.

187
00:11:44,469 --> 00:11:46,495
Over there.
I see someone.

188
00:11:47,914 --> 00:11:50,476
Can you keep an eye on Song Yi for me?

189
00:11:50,477 --> 00:11:53,295
Stay back here.
Stay here, and stay hidden.

190
00:11:53,296 --> 00:11:54,660
- Do you understand?
- Yes, I understand.

191
00:11:54,661 --> 00:11:57,064
Camera team.
All of you get back there too.

192
00:11:57,065 --> 00:11:58,554
Come on, and get back there.

193
00:11:58,555 --> 00:12:01,650
Hurry up and get back there.
You're going to get us caught.

194
00:12:01,651 --> 00:12:04,691
Don't you know what's going on here?
This is a special situation.

195
00:12:04,692 --> 00:12:06,715
[Once in a lifetime chance for Scholar Ha?]

196
00:12:07,846 --> 00:12:10,982
- I will return once I've found the palanquin.
- Okay, I understand.

197
00:12:11,393 --> 00:12:13,041
Do you have any money?

198
00:12:14,088 --> 00:12:17,621
This is a variety show!
You take credit cards?

199
00:12:17,622 --> 00:12:19,003
That's amazing.

200
00:12:19,004 --> 00:12:21,482
Get money from your VJ,
and get yourself a snack.

201
00:12:21,483 --> 00:12:24,202
[Even though he may not have any money,
he's still trying to take care of Song Yi.]

202
00:12:24,202 --> 00:12:25,785
I will return soon with the palanquin.

203
00:12:25,786 --> 00:12:27,725
Just wait here for a moment.

204
00:12:28,727 --> 00:12:36,268
[Now that the jade hairpin has been found...
he has to find the 'R' marked palanquin.]

205
00:12:38,577 --> 00:12:40,251
Isn't that a palanquin?

206
00:12:41,674 --> 00:12:43,823
What is that thing over there?

207
00:12:46,644 --> 00:12:48,507
This looks similar to a palanquin.

208
00:12:48,508 --> 00:12:50,523
Isn't this it?

209
00:12:51,414 --> 00:12:55,236
I would appreciate it if you would
pull the coat down for a moment.

210
00:12:55,237 --> 00:12:57,025
I need to check your hairpin.

211
00:12:57,442 --> 00:13:00,603
If you go that way...
wait, they're over there.

212
00:13:00,604 --> 00:13:02,717
That's Song Ji Hyo.
Come on, let's get away from here.

213
00:13:02,718 --> 00:13:04,294
[Discovers Scholar Blank and
Scholar Kkuk off in the distance.]

214
00:13:04,937 --> 00:13:08,140
[Runs away as soon as he sees them.]

215
00:13:18,073 --> 00:13:20,785
How is it that we keep running into
each other like this?

216
00:13:20,786 --> 00:13:22,798
[No matter where he escapes to,
he's still within Scholar Kkuk's grasp.]

217
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:25,034
- We must be destined to be together.
- I have some business to tend to.

218
00:13:25,035 --> 00:13:27,076
- Master Ji.
- Please hold on.

219
00:13:27,648 --> 00:13:29,816
- Master Ji.
- Yes?

220
00:13:29,817 --> 00:13:32,682
- Wait a moment.
- There you are, Master Ji.

221
00:13:32,683 --> 00:13:34,215
[Scholar Blank is now on the scene too.]

222
00:13:34,216 --> 00:13:36,891
- Master Ji.
- You two have me surrounded.

223
00:13:36,892 --> 00:13:39,171
[Big-nose is caught between
a rock and a hard place.]

224
00:13:39,964 --> 00:13:42,819
- I have some information for you.
- Information?

225
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:45,202
I just saw Yoo Jae Suk pass by this area.

226
00:13:45,203 --> 00:13:50,654
[Attempts to avoid danger by selling
Scholar Yoo out... and he fails.]

227
00:13:52,219 --> 00:13:55,088
I have a bad feeling about this.
Wait a minute.

228
00:13:55,089 --> 00:13:57,377
[Already predicting his own outcome.]

229
00:13:57,378 --> 00:13:59,517
How can I make this look most entertaining?

230
00:13:59,518 --> 00:14:01,207
Would it be better for me to
attempt an escape

231
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:04,034
or would it be better for me to give
you easy access to my back?

232
00:14:05,263 --> 00:14:06,935
Okay, then I'll see you later.

233
00:14:08,911 --> 00:14:11,289
I feel like something like this
may happen in the future too.

234
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:15,835
[Scenes like this...
are going to happen often.]

235
00:14:15,836 --> 00:14:17,319
You scoundrel!

236
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,919
How dare you approach me?

237
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,685
- You scoundrel.
- Scholar Song.

238
00:14:20,686 --> 00:14:23,247
How dare you try to oust me in front
of this row of drying corn?

239
00:14:23,248 --> 00:14:25,179
[There's just no way of escaping from
Scholar Kkuk and Scholar Blank Duo.]

240
00:14:25,729 --> 00:14:28,619
- I'm sorry.
- In front of all these drying corn?

241
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:29,950
I'm sorry.

242
00:14:30,445 --> 00:14:31,729
- You pulled it off?
- You pulled it off already?

243
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:34,565
- It just broke off.
- That's so flimsy.

244
00:14:34,566 --> 00:14:37,282
- I noticed that it's very flimsy.
- My goodness.

245
00:14:37,283 --> 00:14:39,409
I think I need to get this checked out.

246
00:14:41,673 --> 00:14:45,054
[I'm going to get this checked out,
and I will see you in 400 years.]

247
00:14:46,456 --> 00:14:47,842
<i>Young Master Gae!</i>

248
00:14:49,005 --> 00:14:50,663
- Young Master Ha!
- Ahoy there!

249
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:54,492
Young Master Kim and Young Master Song
are in cahoots.

250
00:14:54,493 --> 00:14:56,545
- Who and who?
- Let's go and eliminate them together.

251
00:14:57,779 --> 00:15:00,606
- We need to join our forces.
- Who did you say is working together?

252
00:15:00,672 --> 00:15:02,668
- It was Young Master Kim.
- Young Master Kim?

253
00:15:02,669 --> 00:15:04,406
Yes, that's right.

254
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:12,287
I can't believe he used Song Ji Hyo
to get to me like that.

255
00:15:12,288 --> 00:15:14,088
[Lovesick Scholar Gae... Out!]

256
00:15:19,292 --> 00:15:21,716
Where is this jade hairpin?

257
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,588
[Scholar Yoo is still in search
for the jade hairpin.]

258
00:15:30,156 --> 00:15:31,831
Hold on a moment.

259
00:15:31,832 --> 00:15:33,228
[He discovers Song Yi in hiding.]

260
00:15:33,229 --> 00:15:35,080
Is it... Eun Hye?

261
00:15:37,719 --> 00:15:41,344
[Unable to recognize her right away
with her face hidden behind her coat.]

262
00:15:41,345 --> 00:15:42,688
I thought she was Eun Hye.

263
00:15:42,689 --> 00:15:45,885
I thought that we were finally getting...
am I wrong?

264
00:15:45,886 --> 00:15:47,399
Is that not Eun Hye over there?

265
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,538
Excuse me, Maiden.

266
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:52,340
May I take a look at your hairpin?

267
00:15:55,116 --> 00:15:56,390
By any chance...

268
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:04,127
[Wait, this young maiden is...]

269
00:16:04,128 --> 00:16:07,031
[In that case...]

270
00:16:07,032 --> 00:16:09,569
By any chance...
is that the jade hairpin?

271
00:16:10,926 --> 00:16:12,770
- Am I right or wrong?
- You're right.

272
00:16:14,825 --> 00:16:18,598
- What do I need to do?
- Find the palanquin for me to ride in.

273
00:16:18,599 --> 00:16:20,566
Isn't it over once I take the jade hairpin?

274
00:16:24,364 --> 00:16:26,791
What is it that you're doing?

275
00:16:26,792 --> 00:16:30,091
[Unable to hold back her laughter from seeing
Scholar Grasshopper standing before her.]

276
00:16:30,092 --> 00:16:32,194
You're aware of the danger luring outside,
aren't you?

277
00:16:32,195 --> 00:16:38,404
So that I'm able to make my escape...
please find the palanquin for me to ride in.

278
00:16:38,405 --> 00:16:40,272
- Is that what I need to do?
- Yes.

279
00:16:40,273 --> 00:16:42,542
- Yep.
- Yep?

280
00:16:44,176 --> 00:16:48,658
[Alien language for the 1600's.]

281
00:16:48,659 --> 00:16:51,806
Do you know what year this is?
This is the 1600's. What do you mean, 'Yep'?

282
00:16:52,337 --> 00:16:55,281
'Heol', 'Daebak', 'Uh-jjeol'.
('Wow', 'Awesome', 'What the...')

283
00:16:55,633 --> 00:16:59,546
[Scholar Yoo has already decoded
the foreign alien speech.]

284
00:17:01,932 --> 00:17:04,602
[Trying to regain her composure.]

285
00:17:04,603 --> 00:17:05,860
The palanquin...

286
00:17:07,296 --> 00:17:10,174
What are you doing right now?
What is it that you're doing?

287
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:14,558
- Do I need to bring the palanquin back here?
- You need to give me a ride.

288
00:17:15,255 --> 00:17:16,554
Yep.

289
00:17:17,912 --> 00:17:19,232
Yep.

290
00:17:20,034 --> 00:17:24,250
- Okay, I understand. Stay here, okay?
- Yes, I understand.

291
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:25,796
Then I will see you momentarily.

292
00:17:26,929 --> 00:17:28,314
Nice to meet you.

293
00:17:29,886 --> 00:17:32,608
- Please hurry.
- I understand.

294
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,738
[Wow... awesome.]

295
00:17:37,544 --> 00:17:39,898
Find the jade hairpin,
and now, find the palanquin?

296
00:17:39,899 --> 00:17:42,725
[Scholar Yoo sets out in a search
for the palanquin.]

297
00:17:50,657 --> 00:17:54,267
[Some magical way of traveling
over water?]

298
00:17:55,055 --> 00:17:56,464
Servant!

299
00:17:56,465 --> 00:17:59,838
[Servant Gwon Yeol is rushing to keep up
with Scholar Yoo in his wake.]

300
00:18:06,707 --> 00:18:08,099
Watch where you're walking.

301
00:18:09,292 --> 00:18:12,191
- I'm sorry.
- Watch where you aim that thing.

302
00:18:12,995 --> 00:18:15,941
[Servant Gwon Yeol's legs are about to give up
on him from having followed Jae Suk's path.]

303
00:18:18,611 --> 00:18:20,896
Wow, I thought that was
the palanquin for a moment.

304
00:18:31,541 --> 00:18:32,779
Look at this.

305
00:18:42,103 --> 00:18:43,526
What could this be?

306
00:18:45,614 --> 00:18:46,937
It's a palanquin!

307
00:18:46,938 --> 00:18:48,479
I see a palanquin over there!

308
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:53,441
[Scholar Yoo finds the palanquin at last!]

309
00:18:56,981 --> 00:19:01,336
- You can either bring her here...
- What are you even saying right now?

310
00:19:01,337 --> 00:19:03,577
I found the palanquin because
I was told to find the palanquin.

311
00:19:03,578 --> 00:19:05,807
I found the hairpin you wanted me to find,
and then you say to find the palanquin.

312
00:19:05,808 --> 00:19:08,361
Now that I've found the palanquin,
you want me to bring the maiden with the pin?

313
00:19:08,362 --> 00:19:11,833
- You're telling me to bring her here?
- You should've brought her with you.

314
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:23,807
[Master... please come back to me.]

315
00:19:23,808 --> 00:19:26,380
So I need to bring her back to the palanquin?

316
00:19:26,997 --> 00:19:31,447
[Now he must bring Maiden Song Yi
back to where the palanquin awaits...]

317
00:19:31,696 --> 00:19:33,490
I'm getting a bad feeling.

318
00:19:37,874 --> 00:19:41,630
Wait... where did...
where did the young maiden go?

319
00:19:41,631 --> 00:19:44,674
[The maiden... is gone?]

320
00:19:46,338 --> 00:19:49,469
[Just moments ago...]

321
00:19:50,017 --> 00:19:53,492
Just remain a little bit more patient.
I've searched all over the place.

322
00:19:53,493 --> 00:19:57,363
- But I haven't been able to find anything.
- Master Yoo has been here.

323
00:19:58,550 --> 00:20:01,126
No! Come here.
You need to come with me.

324
00:20:02,699 --> 00:20:04,209
Here, grab my hand.

325
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:07,436
[Took the maiden away to hide her somewhere
else so that Master Yoo can't find her.]

326
00:20:08,104 --> 00:20:10,693
Master Yoo has been by to see you?

327
00:20:11,832 --> 00:20:14,947
[Scholar Yoo was one step too late.]

328
00:20:15,467 --> 00:20:19,097
Wait... where did the maiden go?

329
00:20:19,098 --> 00:20:20,727
- She left.
- When did she leave?

330
00:20:20,728 --> 00:20:22,835
Ha Ha came and took her away.

331
00:20:23,873 --> 00:20:25,523
How could this be?

332
00:20:29,538 --> 00:20:30,787
Young maiden.

333
00:20:31,177 --> 00:20:33,077
I know that it's cold,
but stay here for just a bit, okay?

334
00:20:33,078 --> 00:20:35,892
- Okay, I understand.
- I'll go and figure out what's going on.

335
00:20:35,893 --> 00:20:39,216
Our secret code is going to be... 'Sorry'.

336
00:20:39,217 --> 00:20:41,210
Sorry, okay?
Give it a try.

337
00:20:41,211 --> 00:20:42,799
- Sorry.
- Okay, sorry.

338
00:20:43,445 --> 00:20:44,902
Sorry.

339
00:20:46,647 --> 00:20:48,191
- Sorry.
- Okay, sorry.

340
00:20:48,192 --> 00:20:51,910
Come out when you hear me say the code.
I'll go find it real quick.

341
00:20:51,911 --> 00:20:53,170
Please return quickly.

342
00:20:53,171 --> 00:20:55,049
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

343
00:21:04,167 --> 00:21:06,987
[Scholar Ha is desperately
seeking the palanquin.]

344
00:21:08,702 --> 00:21:12,656
[Now that he thinks about it, how
is he going to bring the palanquin back?]

345
00:21:12,657 --> 00:21:14,066
I wonder if I should bring her with me?

346
00:21:14,067 --> 00:21:16,428
[Maybe it would be better if he brought
Maiden Song Yi with him?]

347
00:21:21,952 --> 00:21:23,189
Sorry.

348
00:21:24,102 --> 00:21:25,525
Sorry.

349
00:21:28,889 --> 00:21:31,269
[Scholar Kkuk]

350
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:32,790
Scholar Ha?

351
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:36,326
[How did he know that she was here?]

352
00:21:36,327 --> 00:21:40,216
- Who told you such lies?
- Master, I need to escape out of here.

353
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:44,503
- Please find me a palanquin...
- Why are you telling him such odd lies?

354
00:21:44,504 --> 00:21:46,645
- Shut your mouth!
- Shut my mouth?

355
00:21:47,509 --> 00:21:50,082
- Maiden...
- Maybe I should eliminate him.

356
00:21:50,083 --> 00:21:54,775
- Find me a palanquin so that I may escape...
- Maiden, please stop talking.

357
00:21:54,776 --> 00:21:56,729
You need to come with me.

358
00:21:56,730 --> 00:22:00,523
- Wait, I'm sorry, but we love each other!
- Come here.

359
00:22:02,193 --> 00:22:05,772
[Renders Scholar Ha helpless
in the blink of an eye.]

360
00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:10,349
- Stop it!
- You scoundrel! Do you know who I am?

361
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:13,233
- What?
- You scoundrel!

362
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:17,980
- Okay, just wait.
- Wait for what?

363
00:22:17,981 --> 00:22:19,949
Where did my fists go?

364
00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:22,806
Where did my fists go?
Maiden.

365
00:22:22,807 --> 00:22:26,882
I'm sorry, but please help me out.
We're supposed to be in love.

366
00:22:26,883 --> 00:22:30,837
I'm trying to save you.
You can't just ignore my plight.

367
00:22:32,453 --> 00:22:36,395
[Scholar Ha is trying to weasel himself
out of the predicament.]

368
00:22:38,157 --> 00:22:41,666
Just hold on a minute!

369
00:22:47,515 --> 00:22:50,305
Let go of me.
We're all done here.

370
00:22:50,306 --> 00:22:53,060
You really are something else.

371
00:22:53,061 --> 00:22:55,975
- Where did my arms go?
- This is a nice hanbok.

372
00:22:55,976 --> 00:22:58,997
- I'll see you in 400 years.
- See you in 400 years.

373
00:23:04,415 --> 00:23:06,902
I need to find Ha Ha.
Ha Ha.

374
00:23:12,194 --> 00:23:15,621
[Another huge boulder to cross...]

375
00:23:15,622 --> 00:23:19,299
[He thought she was with Scholar Ha,
but she's with Scholar Kkuk instead...]

376
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:21,797
Look who it is.
Scholar Blank!

377
00:23:22,771 --> 00:23:26,117
Scholar Yoo!
I'm on my way out!

378
00:23:26,118 --> 00:23:28,728
Have you found anything?

379
00:23:29,358 --> 00:23:30,961
Who is that?

380
00:23:30,962 --> 00:23:34,971
What do you mean?
You know what that is.

381
00:23:34,972 --> 00:23:37,552
Haven't you already met the maiden?

382
00:23:37,553 --> 00:23:41,599
Well... I have seen her on the drama,
'My Love From Another Star'.

383
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,685
I've already told him.

384
00:23:47,924 --> 00:23:51,071
- Why did you tell him that?
- She already told me.

385
00:23:51,072 --> 00:23:54,303
- Why are you acting like you don't know?
- I think there's a misunderstanding.

386
00:23:55,033 --> 00:23:57,413
Where are you planning on
taking her?

387
00:23:57,414 --> 00:24:01,715
I'm not taking her anywhere,
but we're going to escape together.

388
00:24:01,716 --> 00:24:04,911
Just give me a moment.
I need to ask the maiden something.

389
00:24:04,912 --> 00:24:06,211
- Just a moment.
- Okay.

390
00:24:06,212 --> 00:24:07,432
Maiden.

391
00:24:10,103 --> 00:24:12,932
- Why must I do that?
- Listen to me.

392
00:24:12,933 --> 00:24:17,523
- Please help me out.
- Master Yoo wants me to go to your back...

393
00:24:17,524 --> 00:24:21,524
- and wants me to pull off your tag.
- What are you doing!

394
00:24:21,525 --> 00:24:24,178
- Why are you...
- What are you telling her to do?

395
00:24:24,179 --> 00:24:27,817
- Why are you telling her to do that?
- It's just a misunderstanding.

396
00:24:27,818 --> 00:24:30,665
- What are you doing?
- Why are you telling the maiden to do that?

397
00:24:30,666 --> 00:24:35,041
I'm not on anyone's side.
My priority is to make my escape out of here.

398
00:24:35,042 --> 00:24:37,567
I just need to find my palanquin and
get out of here.

399
00:24:37,568 --> 00:24:40,907
I get the feeling that you know
where it is.

400
00:24:40,908 --> 00:24:42,546
I'm not quite sure where it is.

401
00:24:42,547 --> 00:24:45,849
What does that mean?
You either know, or don't know.

402
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:48,207
What kind of an answer is that?

403
00:24:48,208 --> 00:24:51,987
It means that I don't know,
and I'm not sure about anything else.

404
00:24:51,988 --> 00:24:54,852
- Don't you know what I'm saying?
- Lead the way.

405
00:24:56,439 --> 00:24:59,825
Lead the way,
or I will take this as a challenge.

406
00:25:00,776 --> 00:25:03,284
- Don't you think that you're being too harsh?
- No, I'm not being harsh.

407
00:25:03,285 --> 00:25:05,102
- Come with us.
- Okay.

408
00:25:05,103 --> 00:25:06,740
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

409
00:25:06,741 --> 00:25:09,090
[Agreeing to go together.]

410
00:25:11,178 --> 00:25:13,562
Maiden... why did you tell him that?

411
00:25:13,563 --> 00:25:19,153
I like everything else about you,
but you're too light of the mouth.

412
00:25:19,154 --> 00:25:21,907
Why are you trying to
get her to do bad things?

413
00:25:21,908 --> 00:25:24,320
- How is that a bad thing?
- That is a bad thing.

414
00:25:24,321 --> 00:25:34,034
[With the maiden in between...
their mouths never take a rest.]

415
00:25:36,628 --> 00:25:42,389
- See? You knew where it was.
- That's why I'm taking you there.

416
00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:45,003
- See? You knew where it is.
- Wait just a moment.

417
00:25:45,004 --> 00:25:46,774
Be careful.

418
00:25:46,775 --> 00:25:49,228
[Maiden Song Yi's skirts gets caught
on the steps.]

419
00:26:01,009 --> 00:26:03,878
That's why you should've been
more cautious.

420
00:26:05,084 --> 00:26:08,264
You should've been more cautious.

421
00:26:08,265 --> 00:26:11,472
- I knew that you'd do something like that.
- Scholar Kim.

422
00:26:12,213 --> 00:26:15,164
You should've been more careful.

423
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:21,054
- Scholar Kim.
- I was concerned about the maiden's skirt.

424
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:28,068
[The Grim Reaper appears as
Scholar KKuk's guide.]

425
00:26:28,069 --> 00:26:31,260
- Why am I getting the Grim Reapers?
- Goodbye!

426
00:26:31,261 --> 00:26:35,734
- Why am I getting these two?
- If the maiden's skirt hadn't been caught...

427
00:26:35,735 --> 00:26:38,468
- You just wait and see.
- Wait and see what?

428
00:26:38,469 --> 00:26:41,462
- I will get my revenge.
- Just get out of here.

429
00:26:42,224 --> 00:26:45,094
- Goodbye!
- Goodbye!

430
00:26:45,095 --> 00:26:47,212
Let's go, Maiden.

431
00:26:48,758 --> 00:26:51,266
You stepped on your skirt
at the right moment.

432
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,846
- Did you do that on purpose?
- No, it wasn't done on purpose.

433
00:26:55,847 --> 00:26:58,016
- It wasn't done on purpose?
- Yep.

434
00:26:58,107 --> 00:27:01,760
[No matter what the case,
all thanks to the help of her skirt...]

435
00:27:01,761 --> 00:27:04,809
I can't tell you how hard I've worked
to find this palanquin for you.

436
00:27:04,810 --> 00:27:06,557
There it is.

437
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:09,500
There it is.
Watch your step.

438
00:27:11,174 --> 00:27:13,130
Thanks for all your hard work.

439
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:14,730
There it is.

440
00:27:14,731 --> 00:27:16,469
Take your seat.

441
00:27:22,664 --> 00:27:25,755
- I can't express how thankful I am.
- No, not at all.

442
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:31,544
Even though I almost fell into danger
because of your light mouth...

443
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:34,042
I'm just glad that we were still able to
get to where we are now.

444
00:27:34,043 --> 00:27:37,710
No matter who, or what you are,
you are still my savior.

445
00:27:37,711 --> 00:27:40,314
- No, not at all.
- As a sign of my gratitude...

446
00:27:40,315 --> 00:27:44,669
- I'd like to give you this book as a gift.
- What is this?

447
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:48,568
Please read the book and prepare yourself
for what may happen to you in the future.

448
00:27:49,332 --> 00:27:51,766
Does this contain secrets of the future?

449
00:27:51,767 --> 00:27:53,316
Master.

450
00:27:53,317 --> 00:27:55,452
- There is something that I must tell you.
- What is it?

451
00:27:55,453 --> 00:27:57,058
The truth is...

452
00:27:57,059 --> 00:28:00,044
I... really like you.

453

but a totally different feeling...]

[Trying her best to maintain her composure.]

457
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:19,706
My late grandmother told me that
farewells must be said in advance.

458
00:28:19,707 --> 00:28:23,648
That when the real time comes to say your
farewells, you won't get your chance to do so.

459
00:28:24,118 --> 00:28:27,396
Master, thank you for everything
you've done.

460
00:28:27,397 --> 00:28:29,769
No, please don't mention it.

461
00:28:29,770 --> 00:28:32,133
Other than the fact that you like to
spill all the secrets...

462
00:28:32,134 --> 00:28:35,524
I won't ever forget you.
I'll never be able to forget you.

463
00:28:35,525 --> 00:28:40,552
Yes, then I wish you all the luck with school
since school is back in session.

464
00:28:41,784 --> 00:28:43,635
Safe travels.
Please be careful.

465
00:28:44,172 --> 00:28:46,823
Then do I keep this book in
my possession?

466
00:28:47,428 --> 00:28:50,256
- Goodbye.
- Safe travels.

467
00:28:52,087 --> 00:28:54,576
Will we meet again in the future?

468
00:28:54,577 --> 00:28:56,272
I don't know!

469
00:28:57,848 --> 00:28:59,659
Are you angry?

470
00:29:01,347 --> 00:29:04,510

In 2002, the whole nation will be swept up

How would you know about that?

478
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,475
I just get the feeling that it is.

479

Second day of 2002.

480

The longest numbers on this day are,
16, 18, 24, 42, 44, and 45.

481
00:30:02,090 --> 00:30:03,669
Is this talking about the lottery drawing?

482
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:05,492
How would you know about that?

Of course, I have seen it.

00:31:00,707 --> 00:31:03,257
[Full of history and memories.]

495
00:31:03,258 --> 00:31:05,134
This is what you call, a telephone.

496
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:08,744
- You can talk to someone from afar.
- Is this what you're talking about?

497
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:13,472
[A cellphone from the future?
Could Gary be from another star?]

498
00:31:13,473 --> 00:31:16,146
This is the place where I used to fight
when I was in my twenties.

499
00:31:16,302 --> 00:31:21,037
[Running Man members are transported
to Korea's period of enlightenment.]

500
00:31:21,038 --> 00:31:22,327
No, I won first place.

501
00:31:22,328 --> 00:31:25,628
Aren't you the one who had your tag ripped
off by me in the past?

502
00:31:26,803 --> 00:31:29,136
I've already got my eyes on you,
so you better watch out.

503
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:32,028
- What is it that we have to do?
- What is that in your hand?

504
00:31:32,029 --> 00:31:34,872
[Welcome, Running Envoy.]

505
00:31:34,873 --> 00:31:38,905
[A special mission that requires
some emergency planning.]

506
00:31:39,321 --> 00:31:43,434
We have put five yang in each of your pockets
without your knowledge.

507
00:31:43,435 --> 00:31:45,564
- In here?
- What do you mean? You handed it to us.

508
00:31:45,565 --> 00:31:50,301
[Five yangs were handed out
to each of the members.]

509
00:31:50,302 --> 00:31:53,793
We are going to start a special mission
which will allow you to earn more funds.

510
00:31:54,411 --> 00:31:57,629
A person who decides to take on the mission
can bet money on themselves.

511
00:31:57,664 --> 00:32:00,017
- Is that right?
- I see.

512
00:32:00,018 --> 00:32:02,499
And should you succeed your mission,
you'll earn twice the amount of the bet.

513
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:05,565
But should you fail the mission...
the money will be confiscated.

514
00:32:06,728 --> 00:32:10,594
The first person to earn ten yangs will be
given a huge bonus compensation.

515
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:12,636
[A huge bonus compensation to the first
member who earns ten yangs.]

516
00:32:12,637 --> 00:32:13,844
Okay, Ha Ha can start.

517
00:32:13,845 --> 00:32:16,661
[Determine who will do the mission
by drawing straws.]

518
00:32:16,662 --> 00:32:18,418
- It's not me either.
- Not me.

519
00:32:19,361 --> 00:32:21,223
- It's not me.
- It's one of those two.

520
00:32:23,855 --> 00:32:27,240
[Ji Hyo and Kkuk are it.]

521
00:32:27,241 --> 00:32:30,849
[Scholar Kkuk and Scholar Blank
worked together even in the past...]

522
00:32:31,846 --> 00:32:35,088
[The competition is... 'Book Slamming'.]

523
00:32:35,089 --> 00:32:38,741
- Jong Kook's not very good at this.
- You'll take turns with the book slamming.

524
00:32:38,742 --> 00:32:46,251
[Will take turns with the book slamming,
and the person who fails to flip loses.]

525
00:32:46,252 --> 00:32:48,578
- I don't know about this.
- Then going first may not be good.

526
00:32:48,579 --> 00:32:51,120
- I think who goes first may be important.
- I'm betting on Ji Hyo.

527
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,751
I bet one on myself.

528
00:32:52,752 --> 00:32:55,865
- In that case...
- It's not that I'm awful at this game...

529
00:32:55,865 --> 00:32:58,749
- But I get very nervous.
- I bet four on Jong Kook.

530
00:32:59,106 --> 00:33:01,137
[Jae Suk bets four yangs on Jong Kook!]

531
00:33:01,138 --> 00:33:05,231
[And the nagging is just a bonus?]

532
00:33:06,773 --> 00:33:08,454
- Four?
- Okay, I bet four.

533
00:33:08,455 --> 00:33:11,205
I bet two on myself.

534
00:33:11,206 --> 00:33:13,175
I bet everything I have on Jong Kook.

535
00:33:13,176 --> 00:33:15,098
[Going all in!
Bets everything on Jong Kook.]

536
00:33:15,099 --> 00:33:17,624
Rock, paper, scissors.
I hope that you win.

537
00:33:17,625 --> 00:33:20,244
[Rock, paper, scissors to determine
who will get to go first.]

538
00:33:20,730 --> 00:33:23,241
[Ji Hyo wins.]

539
00:33:23,865 --> 00:33:26,181
- Song Ji Hyo!
- I won.

540
00:33:26,182 --> 00:33:30,629
- Tell him to go first.
- Okay, I want Jong Kook to go first.

541
00:33:30,630 --> 00:33:32,792
[Kkuk to go first.]

542
00:33:35,713 --> 00:33:38,585
[Is Mr. Capable nervous?
Muttering to himself over and over.]

543
00:33:38,586 --> 00:33:41,006
I'm not even nervous right now.
See the smile on my face?

544
00:33:41,007 --> 00:33:43,915
[So please don't get too nervous...]

545
00:33:43,916 --> 00:33:45,871
- You won't be able to do it.
- This is no big deal.

546
00:33:45,872 --> 00:33:47,491
- Here I go.
- Okay, do it.

547
00:33:47,492 --> 00:33:50,038
Come on and do it!
You can do it!

548
00:33:50,039 --> 00:33:52,835
This is all ready to get flipped over already.

549
00:33:52,836 --> 00:33:55,790
- I'm nervous to death!
- Stop being so nervous.

550
00:33:56,183 --> 00:34:00,047
[The divine Mr. Capable is nervous
in front of the Book Slamming game?]

551
00:34:00,048 --> 00:34:03,148
- I'm nervous to death.
- That coin is ready to get flipped over.

552
00:34:03,751 --> 00:34:07,159
It wants to get slammed.
It's ready to get flipped over.

553
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:09,743
Look at how it's ready for you already.

554
00:34:09,744 --> 00:34:12,130
- Just do it.
- It's ready to flip over, isn't it?

555
00:34:15,048 --> 00:34:17,133
- You've done it, it's no big deal.
- Just do it already.

556
00:34:18,967 --> 00:34:20,978
[Finally goes for it.]

557
00:34:20,979 --> 00:34:23,129
- Get ready to win.
- You know where to hit it, right?

558
00:34:23,813 --> 00:34:26,193
[Kkuk succeeds.]

559
00:34:26,534 --> 00:34:29,528
[Elated as if he just won the World Cup
all by himself.]

560
00:34:30,449 --> 00:34:32,725
- No, that counts.
- But you didn't say, 'Challenge'.

561
00:34:33,245 --> 00:34:35,732
- No, that counts.
- Ji Hyo's turn.

562
00:34:35,733 --> 00:34:37,200
[It's now Ji Hyo's turn.]

563
00:34:39,429 --> 00:34:40,739
Here I go.

564
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:42,464
[Goes for it immediately without
any fanfare?]

565
00:34:45,582 --> 00:34:48,511
[So very easily succeeds.]

566
00:34:48,512 --> 00:34:50,250
- Song Ji Hyo!
- You did great.

567
00:34:51,313 --> 00:34:53,781
[Deserving of her 'Ace' reputation!]

568
00:34:54,777 --> 00:34:57,008
[Kkuk's turn once again.]

569
00:35:03,597 --> 00:35:06,955
He's nervous, he's nervous.
You're so nervous right now.

570
00:35:12,338 --> 00:35:14,559
We won!
We won!

571
00:35:19,547 --> 00:35:21,799
- We did it.
- Let's go with best out of three.

572
00:35:23,307 --> 00:35:24,965
Let's go with best out of three.

573
00:35:24,966 --> 00:35:29,141
I went first, right?
And since I failed this last round...

574
00:35:29,511 --> 00:35:32,635
we'll say that we play another round
and if Ji Hyo wins again, then that's that.

575
00:35:32,636 --> 00:35:35,412
- What are you talking about?
- She already won.

576
00:35:35,413 --> 00:35:38,201
Don't you know what era we're in?
This is the time of enlightenment.

577
00:35:38,982 --> 00:35:41,817
[Time of enlightenment... what about it?]

578
00:35:41,818 --> 00:35:43,360
- Do you even know what that means?
- This is the time of enlightenment.

579
00:35:43,361 --> 00:35:45,452
- We have a condition.
- What's your condition?

580
00:35:45,453 --> 00:35:47,324
Kim Jong Kook has to drink
a bottle of cola.

581
00:35:47,325 --> 00:35:49,190
[Kim Jong Kook to drink a bottle
in one shot.]

582
00:35:49,191 --> 00:35:52,276
- What kind of a condition is that?
- Okay. We accept your condition.

583
00:35:52,277 --> 00:35:54,094
- We accept.
- Okay, deal.

584
00:35:54,095 --> 00:35:57,390
[One shot of cola.
Deal is made without his approval.]

585
00:35:57,391 --> 00:35:59,109
- Do you want to lose?
- I bet five yangs on you!

586
00:35:59,626 --> 00:36:01,067
I bet everything I have on you!

587
00:36:01,068 --> 00:36:03,626
- You only bet one yang!
- Give me back my money then!

588
00:36:04,158 --> 00:36:06,032
We bet everything we have on you.

589
00:36:06,524 --> 00:36:09,550
- What are you doing?
- You can't drink a bottle of cola for us?

590
00:36:11,447 --> 00:36:14,970
What do you think you're doing?
Just drink the cola! We've bet everything!

591
00:36:15,932 --> 00:36:18,380
- Just drink a bottle of cola!
- Let's do this!

592
00:36:20,186 --> 00:36:22,324
You can't say anything else after this.

593
00:36:22,325 --> 00:36:24,387
[A scene that can't be missed.
Kim Jong Kook drinking a bottle of cola.]

594
00:36:24,388 --> 00:36:27,797
I'll drink all this in one shot.

595
00:36:27,798 --> 00:36:29,829
So let's go for best out of three.

596
00:36:29,830 --> 00:36:32,141
- Come on.
- But it doesn't count if he burps.

597
00:36:32,142 --> 00:36:35,915
- But if he doesn't burp...
- Deal. He can't burp for five seconds.

598
00:36:35,916 --> 00:36:37,963
[Can't burp for five seconds after
chugging the bottle in one shot.]

599
00:36:37,964 --> 00:36:40,523
[The negotiation is over again
without his consent.]

600
00:36:40,524 --> 00:36:42,549
We bet all our money on you.

601
00:36:42,550 --> 00:36:44,607
We bet everything we had,
and it's just one bottle of cola.

602
00:36:44,608 --> 00:36:46,758
- Just don't burp!
- Don't burp for five seconds.

603
00:36:48,186 --> 00:36:50,165
Set, go.

604
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:51,898
Just open up your throat.
You've seen it done before.

605
00:36:53,485 --> 00:36:56,177
There's no time limit, so take your time.

606
00:36:56,178 --> 00:37:00,091
- Even the way he drinks is frightening.
- If you have to burp, then do it now.

607
00:37:00,092 --> 00:37:02,589
- Even his throat has muscles.
- It's like shooting a commercial.

608
00:37:05,062 --> 00:37:08,949
- He actually looks sexy.
- You should take off your shirt.

609
00:37:14,169 --> 00:37:16,812
[It's a cola fountain.]

610
00:37:18,643 --> 00:37:20,543
- What the heck!
- You failed.

611
00:37:21,851 --> 00:37:24,391
[Book Slamming Game-  Ji Hyo wins!]

612
00:37:26,313 --> 00:37:29,424
Let's just play one more round.
Let's do what we've agreed to.

613
00:37:29,991 --> 00:37:31,873
We need to admit that you lost.

614
00:37:31,874 --> 00:37:34,433
You're a sore loser, aren't you?

615
00:37:34,434 --> 00:37:37,154
- You need to accept the inevitable.
- Accept that you lost.

616
00:37:37,155 --> 00:37:39,871
- You need to accept your defeat.
- You're on his side, aren't you?

617
00:37:39,872 --> 00:37:42,347
- Of course, we are!
- We're totally on the same team!

618
00:37:42,348 --> 00:37:44,339
[How can you even question that?
Of course, we are!]

619
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:46,520
I'm a penniless beggar now
because of Jong Kook.

620
00:37:51,361 --> 00:37:52,933
Song Ji Hyo wins.

621
00:37:52,934 --> 00:37:56,950
[Two yangs in the first round,
and three yangs in the second-  Ji Hyo wins!]

622
00:38:00,667 --> 00:38:09,261
A special book of prophecy will be given to
Ji Hyo for being the first to win ten yangs.

623
00:38:09,931 --> 00:38:12,829
- Nostradamus?
- A Nostradamus book?

624
00:38:12,830 --> 00:38:16,653
- You can't show anyone else.
- Then you must've gotten something earlier.

625
00:38:16,654 --> 00:38:20,356
- You must've got something too earlier.
- Why did you give that to her in front of us?

626
00:38:21,416 --> 00:38:25,213
[Just what... could this be?]

627
00:38:25,214 --> 00:38:28,087
I guess this is all going to come down to
the use of my physical strength later on.

628
00:38:28,088 --> 00:38:30,130
Let's go.
Let's just go for now.

629
00:38:30,131 --> 00:38:31,999
[Off to the next era.]

630
00:38:35,831 --> 00:38:39,023
[The mystic prophet, Nostradamus.]

631
00:38:40,604 --> 00:38:43,550
[First prophecy.]

632
00:38:43,551 --> 00:38:47,049
<i>[In the Eastern Peninsula of the five colors,
people of the world will gather hand in hand.]</i>

633
00:38:49,882 --> 00:38:55,535
<i>After two thousand years have passed,
and on the seventh moon...</i>

634
00:38:55,536 --> 00:39:00,418
<i>the moon will swallow up the sun and
plunge the world into darkness.</i>

635
00:39:01,654 --> 00:39:03,315
That's the eclipse.

636
00:39:07,508 --> 00:39:12,749
[And... the third prophecy.]

637
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:14,714
[Could this be?]

638
00:39:15,127 --> 00:39:18,702
[Part three will start in 30 seconds.]

639
00:39:20,376 --> 00:39:23,460
[The Book Slamming Game from
a moment ago.]

640
00:39:33,858 --> 00:39:38,215
[The time... came to a stop?]

641
00:39:42,004 --> 00:39:45,329
[And some mystical power took control of
the coin to ensure it didn't flip over.]

642
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:52,112
[Just... how did that happen?]

643
00:39:57,338 --> 00:39:59,456
[Earlier this morning.]

644
00:40:03,198 --> 00:40:04,682
Mr. Do Min Joon.

645
00:40:04,683 --> 00:40:06,334
Mr. Do Min Joon?

646
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:10,466
[Do... Min... Joon?]

647
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:18,207
[Do Min Joon of Running Star- Ha Ha.]

648
00:40:20,215 --> 00:40:23,121
[Ha Ha is Do Min Joon?]

649
00:40:23,122 --> 00:40:25,468
Why are you laughing?

650
00:40:30,339 --> 00:40:39,465
You left your home, Gold Planet, and crash
landed on earth in your UFO 400 years ago.

651
00:40:39,466 --> 00:40:42,945
And since then, you have been living here
on this earth for the past 400 years.

652
00:40:43,710 --> 00:40:48,646
- Cheon Song Yi, whom you met 400 years ago...
- Song Yi.

653
00:40:49,230 --> 00:40:50,768
Song Yi!

654
00:40:51,338 --> 00:40:55,817
You still miss and long for Song Yi,
whom you met 400 years ago, right?

655
00:40:55,818 --> 00:40:57,337
Yes, you're right.

656
00:40:57,754 --> 00:41:00,246
Of the members that are here today...

657
00:41:00,247 --> 00:41:05,050
your soul mate, Cheon Song Yi,
is in presence within one of them.

658
00:41:05,051 --> 00:41:09,176
- She's here? Song Yi is here?
- Yes, she is here.

659
00:41:09,177 --> 00:41:12,059
- And since you're an alien...
- That is correct.

660
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:16,094
What is the special power that
Do Min Joon possesses?

661
00:41:16,095 --> 00:41:20,773
Ability to travel through time,
ability to pause time, and to teleport.

662
00:41:20,774 --> 00:41:24,480
- Yes, he does have all those powers.
- Yes, he does.

663
00:41:24,515 --> 00:41:27,814
- You really must love the drama.
- Yes, I've seen all the episodes.

664
00:41:28,439 --> 00:41:33,413
- No need to explain the powers to you then?
- I will not let Jae Kyung get away with it.

665
00:41:33,513 --> 00:41:37,348
Jae Kyung is so frightening.
He's scary even when he smiles.

666
00:41:38,985 --> 00:41:40,731
Ha Ha from another star...

667
00:41:40,732 --> 00:41:43,913
[My Love From a Running Star...]

668
00:41:43,914 --> 00:41:46,796
[You must rescue your soul mate,
Song Yi, from danger...]

669
00:41:46,797 --> 00:41:52,583
[And return home to Gold Planet,
to live happily ever after with all the gold.]

670
00:41:52,618 --> 00:41:55,999
May I go to the opening in my own style?

671
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,524
- Yes, you may.
- Teletransportation.

672
00:42:02,519 --> 00:42:04,587
[Haroro is the best when it comes to
the usage of his supernatural powers?]

673
00:42:06,424 --> 00:42:11,695
[When the time came to a standstill...]

674
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:24,397
[It was Ha Ha's usage of his superpowers!]

675
00:42:27,951 --> 00:42:29,772
We won!

676
00:42:29,773 --> 00:42:33,653
[See the strength of Ha Ha's powers!]

677
00:42:34,923 --> 00:42:37,016
<i>- We won.
- Let's go for best out of three.</i>

678
00:42:38,025 --> 00:42:40,941
- What's your condition?
- Jong Kook drinks a bottle of cola.

679
00:42:40,942 --> 00:42:42,803
[And even made Jong Kook drink
a bottle of cola.]

680
00:42:50,807 --> 00:42:56,029
[My Love From a Running Star-
Final Record.]

681
00:42:56,218 --> 00:43:03,456
[I, Do Min Joon...
have waited 400 years for this day.]

682
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:10,545
[The day that I get to return to Gold Planet
with my love, Cheon Song Yi.]

683
00:43:12,546 --> 00:43:14,214
400 years.

684
00:43:14,215 --> 00:43:15,837
400 years ago...

685
00:43:18,395 --> 00:43:21,579
I never got to seat my Song Yi
on that palanquin.

686
00:43:24,559 --> 00:43:30,018
[Even though fate brought them together
before anyone else 400 years ago...]

687
00:43:30,019 --> 00:43:34,614
[Their tragic fate tore them apart before he
could seat her on top of her palanquin.]

688
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:40,264
[Just wait a little bit longer, Song Yi.]

689
00:43:41,453 --> 00:43:49,028
[You from another star, Ha Min Joon-
Board the UFO with your Song Yi to win.]

690
00:43:49,029 --> 00:43:52,714
The UFO's door will open in two hours.

691
00:43:52,715 --> 00:43:55,887
You must stay on the run and escape from
being captured for those two hours.

692
00:43:55,888 --> 00:43:58,364
If I miss my chance this time, then I'll have
to live here for another 400 years.

693
00:44:00,542 --> 00:44:06,066
You must first reunite with Cheon Song Yi,
who's desperately waiting for you.

694
00:44:07,589 --> 00:44:09,819
Is Cheon Song Yi back again?

695
00:44:09,820 --> 00:44:13,337
- Of course, she is.
- But the young version of her left already.

696
00:44:13,338 --> 00:44:17,017
[If you're saying that it's Cheon Song Yi...]

697
00:44:18,207 --> 00:44:22,353
[Could it be her?]

698
00:44:23,255 --> 00:44:25,914
Why are you making me all nervous now?
Wait a minute.

699
00:44:27,533 --> 00:44:29,130
No way.

700
00:44:30,142 --> 00:44:33,741
Then is there another guest on the show
other than our regular members?

701
00:44:33,742 --> 00:44:35,825
You won't be disappointed.

702
00:44:35,826 --> 00:44:38,535
This is driving me crazy.

703
00:44:39,709 --> 00:44:43,017
[Could this be the day?]

704
00:44:44,719 --> 00:44:47,417
[Who could our Cheon Song Yi be?]

705
00:44:47,418 --> 00:44:50,369
Could you be the one from another star?

706
00:44:52,559 --> 00:44:55,574
[Am I Do Min Joon?]

707
00:44:56,311 --> 00:44:59,207
If you want to check and see if you are
Do Min Joon from another star

708
00:44:59,208 --> 00:45:01,356
then you must reunite with Cheon Song Yi.
Ways to reunite with Song Yi-

709
00:45:01,357 --> 00:45:03,516
Find the drama script,
and reenact a scene from the show.

710
00:45:03,517 --> 00:45:05,550
If you are Do Min Joon,
then you will hear a bell in the distance

711
00:45:05,551 --> 00:45:07,909
when you're finished reenacting the scene.

712
00:45:09,259 --> 00:45:12,069
Even if you are not Do Min Joon

713
00:45:12,070 --> 00:45:17,145
you can still win by boarding the UFO
once you find the gold key to it.

714
00:45:18,734 --> 00:45:21,138
So we can still win
even if we aren't Do Min Joon.

715
00:45:21,139 --> 00:45:23,470
- Do you understand it?
- Yes, I do, but let me look at it again.

716
00:45:23,471 --> 00:45:28,496
The UFO door will open in two hours,
and only one human can board the ship.

717
00:45:30,462 --> 00:45:35,247
So it's one of the two.
Either Do Min Joon, or board the UFO.

718
00:45:35,248 --> 00:45:36,635
Am I right?

719
00:45:36,636 --> 00:45:38,835
Gold planet?

720
00:45:40,433 --> 00:45:43,523
So the prize... must be gold?

721
00:45:44,755 --> 00:45:46,866
In two hours?
So the time is already predetermined?

722
00:45:46,867 --> 00:45:49,333
[In order to board the ship,
you must remain alive for two hours.]

723
00:45:49,334 --> 00:45:51,165
I have to find the script
and reenact a scene.

724
00:45:51,166 --> 00:45:54,419
I've already received my book of prophecy.

725
00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:56,071
[Jae Suk received a book of prophecy from
the younger version of Song Yi earlier.]

726
00:45:56,072 --> 00:46:02,121
<i>Go to where the horses run free, and the
berries flow like water to find your answer.</i>

727
00:46:02,649 --> 00:46:04,966
So this is where the script must be.

728
00:46:08,430 --> 00:46:12,426
I need to figure out if
I'm Do Min Joon or not first.

729
00:46:13,258 --> 00:46:16,301
But if it's Cheon Song Yi...
then is Jeon Ji Hyun coming?

730
00:46:16,302 --> 00:46:18,801
I've never seen her in person before.

731
00:46:19,282 --> 00:46:21,082
I can't help but feel excited.

732
00:46:23,862 --> 00:46:25,497
Cheon Song Yi?

733
00:46:26,625 --> 00:46:29,754
[Everyone is hoping for Jeon Ji Hyun.]

734
00:46:30,823 --> 00:46:36,379
In that case, that Nostradamus book
that I received earlier...

735
00:46:37,623 --> 00:46:40,317
it mentioned something about
a flock of evil.

736
00:46:45,549 --> 00:46:49,915
<i>Ultimate evil will come forth in darkness
to throw the world into a state of chaos.</i>

737
00:46:50,697 --> 00:46:54,177
Which means that one of us is
the ultimate force of evil.

738
00:46:54,178 --> 00:46:57,169
[An ultimate force of evil is
hiding amongst them!]

739
00:46:57,170 --> 00:47:02,323
So we don't know who the evil is,
nor who Cheon Song Yi or Do Min Joon is?

740
00:47:02,983 --> 00:47:07,694
- It's possible that you could be Do Min Joon.
- So be sure not to get eliminated, right?

741
00:47:07,695 --> 00:47:10,519
[Who could be the force of evil
that's threatening everyone's happiness?]

742
00:47:11,079 --> 00:47:13,340
Where's the script?

743
00:47:13,341 --> 00:47:15,787
[First things first- Find the script
and see if you are Do Min Joon.]

744
00:47:27,169 --> 00:47:30,286
[Cellphone with an 'R' sticker?]

745
00:47:31,761 --> 00:47:35,609
[A cellphone in hiding with
the 'R' sticker on it!]

746
00:47:40,431 --> 00:47:42,039
Here's something.

747
00:47:42,841 --> 00:47:47,316
[My Love From Another Star's script is
saved onto the phone!]

748
00:47:47,317 --> 00:47:49,233
Stop doing everything and don't move.

749
00:47:49,234 --> 00:47:51,324
Or I will kick you out of here.

750
00:47:52,502 --> 00:47:55,315
Who knew that I'd find it this quickly?

751
00:47:55,316 --> 00:47:56,669
[Ace Blank Ji is the first
to find the script!]

752
00:47:56,670 --> 00:48:00,698
Okay, I found the script now.
So who's Cheon Song Yi?

753
00:48:01,813 --> 00:48:03,272
Could it be?

754
00:48:03,273 --> 00:48:05,284
Could it be that young girl from earlier?

755
00:48:05,285 --> 00:48:08,166
[Who could the mysterious Cheon Song Yi be?]

756
00:48:09,272 --> 00:48:14,315
[The time is getting closer for the
UFO to depart...]

757
00:48:20,068 --> 00:48:27,559
[Unidentifiably mysterious...
our woman of the hour.]

758
00:48:30,859 --> 00:48:35,623
[Goddess of the Hallyu wave,
Cheon Song Yi...]

759
00:48:35,624 --> 00:48:42,031
[Is she here with us right now?]

760
00:48:45,108 --> 00:48:48,917
[Her name alone is enough to make
any man's heart beat flutter.]

761
00:48:48,918 --> 00:48:55,639
[Who could she be?]

762
00:49:03,311 --> 00:49:06,069
- What the heck is this?
- Sorry.

763
00:49:08,867 --> 00:49:11,381
- Don't you know who I am?
- What are you doing?

764
00:49:11,382 --> 00:49:12,713
[I'm Cheon Song Yi.]

765
00:49:12,714 --> 00:49:14,948
I thought Jeon Ji Hyun was going to be on.

766
00:49:14,949 --> 00:49:17,389
Don't you know who I am?
I'm Cheon Song Yi.

767
00:49:18,537 --> 00:49:23,269
<i>You're Cheon Song Yi, the Goddess of Hallyu
from 'My Love From Another Star'.</i>

768
00:49:23,270 --> 00:49:24,406
I am?

769
00:49:27,474 --> 00:49:29,173
[400 years ago.]

770
00:49:29,174 --> 00:49:31,600
[Young Cheon Song Yi, who was able to find
her palanquin with the help of Jae Suk...]

771
00:49:31,601 --> 00:49:35,703
[Chooses to be reincarnated with
Jae Suk's looks 400 years later.]

772
00:49:35,704 --> 00:49:41,207
Find the gold key to the UFO that you
and Do Min Joon will take to make your escape

773
00:49:41,208 --> 00:49:43,113
and you will win the race if you
board the ship with the key.

774
00:49:43,114 --> 00:49:45,321
You're telling me that I'm Song Yi?

775
00:49:46,077 --> 00:49:49,037
[Even he himself can't believe his own fate.]

776
00:49:49,799 --> 00:49:54,464
[Anyways, this person is Cheon Song Yi,
the Goddess of the Hallyu wave.]

777
00:49:54,465 --> 00:49:57,685
- Why am I turned down?
- What do you mean? I just turned you down.

778
00:49:58,043 --> 00:50:00,958
- Why are you turning me down?
- I just did. I'm Cheon Song Yi.

779
00:50:00,959 --> 00:50:03,630
I just turned you down.

780
00:50:03,631 --> 00:50:07,081
Seriously.
You can't be Do Min Joon.

781
00:50:07,082 --> 00:50:09,379
- I am Do Min Joon. Don't you remember?
- What did you say?

782
00:50:09,380 --> 00:50:11,639
I just turned you down.

783
00:50:15,361 --> 00:50:17,146
- What are you doing?
- Why are you turning me down?

784
00:50:17,147 --> 00:50:19,234
I guess words may not be enough.

785
00:50:20,088 --> 00:50:23,008
- What kind of a Cheon Song Yi are you?
- Who do you think you are?

786
00:50:23,009 --> 00:50:24,810
What a joke.

787
00:50:24,811 --> 00:50:26,536
What a joke?

788
00:50:32,936 --> 00:50:34,862
What kind of a Cheon Song Yi are you?

789
00:50:36,034 --> 00:50:38,176
You're telling me that you're Cheon Song Yi?

790
00:50:38,177 --> 00:50:41,372
- No way.
- I don't want you, so you can just leave.

791
00:50:41,373 --> 00:50:43,612
- I don't want you.
- You're telling me that you're Song Yi?

792
00:50:43,613 --> 00:50:47,214
That's absolutely ridiculous.
How can you be Cheon Song Yi?

793
00:50:47,215 --> 00:50:51,800
[Muscle boy, Kkuk, barges in out of nowhere
to take Cheon Song Yi by the arms.]

794
00:50:51,801 --> 00:50:55,786
This is driving me crazy. This is the most
absurd thing I have ever heard.

795
00:50:55,787 --> 00:50:57,669
- Song Yi.
- Wait a minute.

796
00:50:57,670 --> 00:51:01,759
- Let me go for a minute.
- What kind of a ridiculous joke is this?

797
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:04,630
Muscle boy, and Big-nose...
I'm turning you both down.

798
00:51:06,044 --> 00:51:08,886
- You really are very cocky.
- I'm Cheon Song Yi.

799
00:51:09,333 --> 00:51:15,312
[And... there's one being who's still
unaware of this turn of events.]

800
00:51:16,183 --> 00:51:23,198
[After 400 years of waiting,
my soul mate, Cheon Song Yi...]

801
00:51:23,199 --> 00:51:26,153
[I'm coming, Cheon Song Yi.]

802
00:51:28,016 --> 00:51:29,944
So this is no joke?
He's Cheon Song Yi?

803
00:51:29,945 --> 00:51:32,460
- I'm Cheon Song Yi.
- Song Yi!

804
00:51:34,906 --> 00:51:40,252
[My love... Cheon Song Yi.]

805
00:51:40,253 --> 00:51:42,221
[Did you call out my name?]

806
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:47,718
[You are... Cheon Song Yi?]

807
00:51:47,766 --> 00:51:52,172
[Oh My God.]

808
00:51:52,173 --> 00:51:55,646
[My Lord... why have you abandoned me?]

809
00:51:55,647 --> 00:51:57,690
I thought it was going to be Jeon Ji Hyun.

810
00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:01,553
- I thought it was going to be Jeon Ji Hyun.
- Then just leave.

811
00:52:01,554 --> 00:52:04,991
- I'm turning him down too. Leave.
- Why would she be on the show?

812
00:52:04,992 --> 00:52:08,294
- I really thought that it would be her.
- That would make no sense.

813
00:52:08,295 --> 00:52:10,614
Go tell your managers
that I turned you all down.

814
00:52:11,263 --> 00:52:14,456
Go tell your managers that I, Cheon Song Yi,
just turned you all down.

815
00:52:15,650 --> 00:52:18,574
[This has to be a nightmare.]

816
00:52:18,575 --> 00:52:20,910
- Why do you all look so disappointed?
- No, that's not it.

817
00:52:20,911 --> 00:52:23,520
Don't you think that you guys crossed
the line way too much?

818
00:52:24,148 --> 00:52:27,945
I turned you all down.
I, Cheon Song Yi, turned you all down.

819
00:52:27,946 --> 00:52:30,320
[Cheon Song Yi and Do Min Joon
are busy putting each other down.]

820
00:52:30,321 --> 00:52:33,159
- Can we reenact the scene?
- Sure, we can reenact it right now.

821
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:34,969
How can you as a Song Yi lick spit
onto your thumb like that?

822
00:52:35,001 --> 00:52:38,544
[Song Yi, without any inhibitions.]

823
00:52:38,545 --> 00:52:42,529
- I'm Cheon Song Yi.
- No, I don't think so. Say, 'sorry'.

824
00:52:42,530 --> 00:52:44,631
- Sorry.
- No, he's Song Yi.

825
00:52:45,329 --> 00:52:47,141
- Sorry.
- He's Cheon Song Yi.

826
00:52:47,142 --> 00:52:49,178
- That's absurd.
- Hey, Gary.

827
00:52:49,179 --> 00:52:52,767
[Everyone is opposed to
Jae Suk being Song Yi.]

828
00:52:52,768 --> 00:52:56,187
- Why do you keep shedding?
- Because this is a cheap knockoff.

829
00:52:57,013 --> 00:52:59,665
- Are you really 'Song Yi'?
- He really is.

830
00:52:59,666 --> 00:53:01,637
I wanted Jeon Ji Hyun!

831
00:53:01,638 --> 00:53:05,083
- Seriously.
- Cheon Song Yi!

832
00:53:06,976 --> 00:53:11,855
[Giraffe rushes in with his greed
to take the spotlight for himself.]

833
00:53:13,576 --> 00:53:15,249
How does that even make any sense?

834
00:53:15,250 --> 00:53:17,033
- That doesn't work.
- Don't do this!

835
00:53:18,524 --> 00:53:23,121
[Do Min Joon hopeful gets knocked down
with a knee kick to the stomach.]

836
00:53:23,122 --> 00:53:26,004
- Look at who it is up there.
- Cheon Song Yim!

837
00:53:26,639 --> 00:53:30,167
- That's my little brother.
- She does look like Cheon Song Yim.

838
00:53:30,168 --> 00:53:33,715
- I really thought Jeon Ji Hyun was coming.
- I'm Cheon Song Yi.

839
00:53:33,716 --> 00:53:35,327
Cheon Song Yi!

840
00:53:35,328 --> 00:53:37,681
Cheon Song Yi!
How is that even possible?

841
00:53:37,682 --> 00:53:40,269
I need everyone's attention right here.

842
00:53:40,270 --> 00:53:42,408
I don't know who Do Min Joon is...

843
00:53:42,409 --> 00:53:45,829
but we just need to work together to get
the gold, and then go our own separate ways.

844
00:53:46,354 --> 00:53:48,330
What kind of a Cheon Song Yi are you?

845
00:53:48,331 --> 00:53:50,709
- Who's Do Min Joon?
- It's me.

846
00:53:50,710 --> 00:53:53,194
- No, it's me.
- I'm Do Min Joon.

847
00:53:53,195 --> 00:53:56,166
- I saved you 400 years ago.
- No, I saved you.

848
00:53:56,778 --> 00:53:59,608
[Everyone is using their own methods to
insist that they are Do Min Joon.]

849
00:53:59,609 --> 00:54:01,990
There's not much time.
You know what happens in two hours, right?

850
00:54:02,492 --> 00:54:05,390
- What are you, a cheerleader?
- The ship leaves in two hours.

851
00:54:05,391 --> 00:54:08,898
[The UFO door will
open in an hour and a half.]

852
00:54:08,899 --> 00:54:10,988
Even if you were to find the key,
I'd still turn you down.

853
00:54:10,989 --> 00:54:15,748
- I'm Cheon Song Yi. I'd turn you down.
- I'd be the one to turn you down!

854
00:54:16,535 --> 00:54:20,942
[Cheon Song Yi vs Do Min Joon-
A battle of their dislike for each other.]

855
00:54:20,943 --> 00:54:26,179
[These two are supposedly
a match made in heaven...]

856
00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:28,888
- I just turned you down.
- You sure are weird looking!

857
00:54:29,489 --> 00:54:30,894
Ugh, seriously.

858
00:54:30,895 --> 00:54:33,276
How unlucky am I?

859
00:54:39,090 --> 00:54:40,958
Yeah, we're cool.

860
00:54:40,959 --> 00:54:45,130
We can work together to get the gold...
and go our own separate ways after.

861
00:54:45,566 --> 00:54:48,727
[Changing his code from 'love' to 'gold'.]

862
00:54:48,728 --> 00:54:51,706
- I'm telling you that I'm Cheon Song Yi.
- Why don't you go take a rest?

863
00:54:51,707 --> 00:54:54,741
Go get it right now.
Go find the script, Gary.

864
00:54:54,742 --> 00:54:56,547
Okay, I understand.

865
00:54:57,060 --> 00:54:59,008
<i>I need to keep my focus on the gold.</i>

866
00:55:00,576 --> 00:55:02,598
I have the script.

867
00:55:03,118 --> 00:55:06,864
[Blank Ji approached Song Yi with
the script that she found.]

868
00:55:07,795 --> 00:55:10,277
- Where is the script?
- It's in my pocket.

869
00:55:10,278 --> 00:55:12,051
- You have the script right now?
- Yes.

870
00:55:13,551 --> 00:55:16,647
- I need to know if I'm Do Min Joon or not.
- You're Do Min Joon?

871
00:55:16,648 --> 00:55:21,195
- I need to find out if I am or not.
- Let's go where no one can hear us.

872
00:55:21,196 --> 00:55:23,499
- You have the script?
- I have it with me.

873
00:55:24,415 --> 00:55:27,235
Why did Cheon Song Yi's pretty clothes
have to get wasted on you?

874
00:55:27,236 --> 00:55:30,333
Is that the scene?
It is the scene!

875
00:55:30,334 --> 00:55:33,897
[The scene that Jae Suk and
Ji Hyo must reenact.]

876
00:55:34,525 --> 00:55:36,403
<i>I'm really good at cleaning.</i>

877
00:55:36,803 --> 00:55:41,259
[A parody of a scene from
'My Love From Another Star'.]

878
00:55:48,431 --> 00:55:51,201
<i>Let me clean this up first.</i>

879
00:55:53,224 --> 00:55:56,849
[Do Min Joon and Cheon Song Yi's
back hug scene!]

880
00:55:56,850 --> 00:55:58,384
So I can kick this off?

881
00:55:58,385 --> 00:56:00,925
[My Love From Another Star-
Back hug scene- Take one.]

882
00:56:00,926 --> 00:56:05,640
- I want you to always treasure this.
- Okay.

883
00:56:08,820 --> 00:56:11,064
Sorry.

884
00:56:11,065 --> 00:56:14,000
Stop moving, and don't do anything
before I end up kicking you out.

885
00:56:15,743 --> 00:56:17,291
I got it.

886
00:56:18,287 --> 00:56:20,864
[Blank Ji's like- NG.]

887
00:56:20,865 --> 00:56:25,735
[Even though the bell didn't sound since
she isn't Do Min Joon...]

888
00:56:25,736 --> 00:56:28,255
[But they decide to give it another try.
So, it's Take Two.]

889
00:56:28,256 --> 00:56:32,907
- I want you to always treasure this.
- Okay.

890
00:56:35,824 --> 00:56:37,455
Sorry.

891
00:56:37,456 --> 00:56:40,212
Stop moving, and don't do anything
before I end up kicking you out.

892
00:56:40,544 --> 00:56:44,129
- I think I got it wrong.
- Seriously, Ji Hyo! What's wrong with you!

893
00:56:45,367 --> 00:56:48,313
[Somehow... it's Take Five.]

894

[Fifth one to be smashed over her head.]

895
00:56:50,728 --> 00:56:53,734
Stop moving, and don't do anything
before I end up kicking you out.

896
00:56:54,055 --> 00:56:55,532
I got it.

897
00:56:56,563 --> 00:57:01,153
[If she really was Do Min Joon,
then the bell should've sounded by now.]

898
00:57:01,154 --> 00:57:02,731
- I don't think it's me.
- I don't think it's you.

899
00:57:02,732 --> 00:57:04,861
- No, I don't think it's me.
- You got the lines right this time, right?

900
00:57:04,862 --> 00:57:06,430
Yes, I got my lines right.

901
00:57:06,431 --> 00:57:08,686
[Blank Ji is off the list of
Do Min Joon possibilities.]

902
00:57:08,687 --> 00:57:10,553
Bye, and sorry.

903
00:57:11,335 --> 00:57:13,053
- Sorry?
- Yeah, sorry.

904
00:57:14,286 --> 00:57:16,326
It's not her.
It's not Ji Hyo.

905
00:57:16,327 --> 00:57:20,668
- Then what do you have to do now?
- I have to go find the key to the UFO.

906
00:57:21,670 --> 00:57:24,747
- You just need to find the key to the UFO?
- Find out where the key is hidden.

907
00:57:25,623 --> 00:57:27,179
And find out where the UFO is?

908
00:57:27,180 --> 00:57:30,283
That's much better than what I have to do.
I have to find out who Do Min Joon is.

909

<i>[In two thousand years, during the second
moon after the passing of 14 seasons...]</i>

Mister, why don't you just go home?

915
00:57:53,086 --> 00:57:59,489
I'm sorry to tell you this, but have yourself
a nice bowl of soup, and just go home.

916

Come on, come with me.
I found the script, so come with me.

[Old man Big-nose, is fully convinced
that he is Do Min Joon.]

920

- Let's go somewhere a little dim.
- Why are you trying to take me to a dim place?

921
00:58:15,396 --> 00:58:18,203
We can't have anyone catch us
doing this.

922

- Come with me.

01:02:02,927 --> 01:02:04,762
I don't think it's you.
I'm dumping you.

970
01:02:05,354 --> 01:02:08,710
[No way that Big-nose could be
Do Min Joon?]

971
01:02:08,711 --> 01:02:10,535
- I have to try the scene with Gary.
- Gary.

972
01:02:10,536 --> 01:02:15,468
[Gary is waiting for his turn with
his copy of the script in hand?]

973
01:02:15,469 --> 01:02:18,146
- What's taking you so long?
- Do Min Joon is so weak.

974
01:02:18,147 --> 01:02:21,646
- I'm telling you that it isn't you.
- How do you know? Go away.

975
01:02:22,552 --> 01:02:25,200
I'm sick and tired of waiting,
so let's speed it up.

976
01:02:25,201 --> 01:02:26,739
Okay, we got it.

977
01:02:27,769 --> 01:02:31,122
[I can't believe that I have to wait
around for that Cheon Song Yi...]

978
01:02:39,134 --> 01:02:42,531
[If they don't succeed at once,
they're going to have to do this again...]

979
01:02:42,532 --> 01:02:45,881
Cheon Song Yi, I was just...

980
01:02:47,572 --> 01:02:51,539
You can't shove your ugly face
into someone else's dream.

981
01:02:55,694 --> 01:02:58,901
[I can't do this for the second time!
Grit down, and finish the scene!]

982
01:03:00,747 --> 01:03:04,430
[Bed kissing scene- Take three- Done.]

983
01:03:05,878 --> 01:03:08,733
I have to go brush my teeth
like 300 times.

984
01:03:10,218 --> 01:03:14,066
[The bell has to sound
if he really is Do Min Joon...]

985
01:03:14,067 --> 01:03:16,219
- Lets go our own separate ways.
- I knew it.

986
01:03:16,992 --> 01:03:20,313
[Going their own separate ways
after that hot kiss.]

987
01:03:20,314 --> 01:03:22,701
I knew that it couldn't be you.

988
01:03:22,702 --> 01:03:25,012
- Hey.
- How many people must I do this with?

989
01:03:27,051 --> 01:03:29,576
- Did you find anything?
- What?

990
01:03:29,577 --> 01:03:32,090
- Why haven't you found anything yet?
- The script?

991
01:03:32,091 --> 01:03:33,957
- I did find it.
- What?

992
01:03:33,958 --> 01:03:35,617
- But it's not you?
- No, I'm not.

993
01:03:35,618 --> 01:03:38,024
[It's been found that Blank Ji
isn't Do Min Joon.]

994
01:03:38,025 --> 01:03:41,020
[And Kkuk still hasn't found his script?]

995
01:03:41,021 --> 01:03:43,041
Didn't you get your mission?

996
01:03:43,042 --> 01:03:48,063
- I know that there's a key to the UFO.
- Then find the key and board the UFO.

997
01:03:48,064 --> 01:03:51,900
- You have to be Do Min Joon to get on it.
- No, you don't have to be Do Min Joon.

998
01:03:52,407 --> 01:03:54,986
- Is that the hint?
- The hint said...

999
01:03:54,987 --> 01:03:57,587
I'm just going to tell you this.
I haven't told anyone this yet.

1000
01:03:58,535 --> 01:04:01,856
- There's Cheon Song Yi and Do Mi Joon.
- Yeah, tell me.

1001
01:04:02,441 --> 01:04:06,034
But the book that I received...

1002
01:04:06,533 --> 01:04:09,253
I was told that there's an evil force.

1003
01:04:11,282 --> 01:04:15,892
[An evil force?]

1004
01:04:15,893 --> 01:04:18,625
There's an evil force,
but I don't know who that evil force is.

1005
01:04:18,626 --> 01:04:21,247
[Blank Ji reveals that there's an
evil force amongst them.]

1006
01:04:22,225 --> 01:04:24,941
I was told that we need to find out
who that evil force is.

1007
01:04:26,816 --> 01:04:28,990
- Seriously.
- Do you get what I'm saying?

1008
01:04:28,991 --> 01:04:31,765
[In that case...]

1009
01:04:32,590 --> 01:04:34,531
- Are you sure?
- I haven't found any scripts yet.

1010
01:04:34,977 --> 01:04:36,728
Okay, I got it.
Let's go.

1011
01:04:37,431 --> 01:04:41,148
[Just then!]

1012
01:04:45,308 --> 01:04:47,158
I'm sorry, Ji Hyo.

1013
01:04:47,159 --> 01:04:50,189
[Why did Mr. Capable do that?]

1014
01:04:51,692 --> 01:04:54,864
[Wait, that's...]

1015
01:04:54,865 --> 01:04:58,960
[The ring symbolic of the evil force?]

1016
01:05:00,252 --> 01:05:03,087
[In that case...]

1017
01:05:04,430 --> 01:05:08,510
[Mr. Capable is the evil force!]

1018
01:05:08,511 --> 01:05:11,506
[Be quiet, Ji Hyo...]

1019
01:05:16,638 --> 01:05:20,975
<i>You are the evil force from
'My Love From Another Star'.</i>

1020
01:05:22,695 --> 01:05:29,066
<i>The ultimate Mr. Capable with the looks,
skills and every other power that you need.</i>

1021
01:05:29,067 --> 01:05:32,404
<i>But you are the ultimate evil with two sides
that are as different as night and day.</i>

1022
01:05:32,796 --> 01:05:35,428
<i>Find the nail ring with a member's name
engraved on it</i>

1023
01:05:35,429 --> 01:05:37,377
<i>and rid that person's name tag
one by one.</i>

1024
01:05:39,782 --> 01:05:41,514
<i>You must oust all the members.</i>

1025
01:05:41,515 --> 01:05:46,754
<i>You can win the race by finding the gold key
and boarding the ship all by yourself.</i>

1026
01:05:46,755 --> 01:05:48,956
[Oust all the members,
and board the ship with the gold key!]

1027
01:05:50,783 --> 01:05:55,695
Then I should pretend to be Do Min Joon like
everyone else, and get close to Cheon Song Yi?

1028
01:05:55,696 --> 01:05:58,786
[The ultimate evil with a hidden evil side.]

1029
01:05:58,787 --> 01:06:01,019
So I just need to board the UFO
all by myself?

1030
01:06:01,845 --> 01:06:04,008
That doesn't sound difficult.

1031
01:06:04,009 --> 01:06:07,470
How dare they try to leave for
Planet Gold by themselves?

1032
01:06:08,529 --> 01:06:10,502
I don't need Cheon Song Yi either.

1033
01:06:11,396 --> 01:06:15,313
[The ultimate evil,
without any pity for anyone.]

1034
01:06:19,080 --> 01:06:20,506
Song Ji Hyo?

1035
01:06:24,728 --> 01:06:28,631
[Goodbye, my friend...]

1036
01:06:30,406 --> 01:06:32,246
Song Yi.

1037
01:06:33,451 --> 01:06:38,134
[Ha Min Joon finally finds a
script of his own.]

1038
01:06:38,135 --> 01:06:40,412
I told you that it's me.

1039
01:06:40,413 --> 01:06:43,363
[But Cheon Song Yi still doesn't
recognize him for who he is.]

1040
01:06:44,049 --> 01:06:46,415
If it's not you, then it means
that Jong Kook is Do Min Joon.

1041
01:06:46,416 --> 01:06:50,415
- I guarantee that it's not him.
- I rather that you were Min Joon than him.

1042
01:06:51,422 --> 01:06:57,194
Even if I were to leave for some planet,
there's no way that I can go with Jong Kook.

1043
01:06:57,195 --> 01:07:02,654
I've been watching you from afar,
and I've started to grow feelings for you.

1044
01:07:03,194 --> 01:07:05,261
I'm the woman of the hour.

1045
01:07:05,794 --> 01:07:08,782
[This Song Yi is getting cockier
by the minute.]

1046
01:07:08,783 --> 01:07:10,151
Sorry.

1047
01:07:10,152 --> 01:07:12,351
- Excuse me?
- I got it.

1048
01:07:12,352 --> 01:07:17,031
[The scene that will solidify these two
as the real Song Yi and Min Joon is...]

1049
01:07:18,520 --> 01:07:27,877
[The heartbreaking scene where Min Joon
has to hide his true feelings for Song Yi.]

1050
01:07:33,550 --> 01:07:37,655
[The scene where he freezes the time
to come up to her and kiss her.]

1051
01:07:37,656 --> 01:07:40,393
You're going to hear the bell ring.

1052
01:07:41,149 --> 01:07:43,355
I have no other hope if you're not Min Joon.

1053
01:07:43,356 --> 01:07:46,446
[These two are really hoping that
Ha Ha is the real Min Joon.]

1054
01:07:46,447 --> 01:07:48,894
<i>But why do I feel like you're
lying to me?</i>

1055
01:07:49,935 --> 01:07:53,440
[Snowy kiss scene- Take one.]

1056
01:07:58,484 --> 01:08:00,041
'I don't like you.'

1057
01:08:02,112 --> 01:08:04,995
'So... what do you want me to do?'

1058
01:08:07,505 --> 01:08:09,707
'I want you to disappear from my sight.'

1059
01:08:12,535 --> 01:08:14,073
'But...'

1060
01:08:16,163 --> 01:08:19,980
'Why does it feel like
you're lying to me right now?'

1061
01:08:24,311 --> 01:08:33,644
[Song Yi has to heartbreakingly turn away
from the one that she loves.]

1062
01:08:33,645 --> 01:08:40,943
[And Min Joon is unable to grab onto her.]

1063
01:08:44,513 --> 01:08:47,910
[And...]

1064
01:08:47,911 --> 01:08:54,422
[Time comes to a halt.]

1065
01:08:57,858 --> 01:09:02,331
[A movement frozen in time...]

1066
01:09:05,318 --> 01:09:08,229
[Has to remain completely frozen.]

1067
01:09:13,239 --> 01:09:17,773
[Even though she may never know...]

1068
01:09:17,774 --> 01:09:23,252
[Do Min Joon wraps his arms
tightly around her.]

1069
01:09:26,670 --> 01:09:33,390
[Just then...]

1070
01:09:33,391 --> 01:09:39,304
[The bell sounds to grant permission
for Min Joon and Song Yi's love.]

1071
01:09:41,011 --> 01:09:48,920
[The sound of the bell could be heard
throughout the building.]

1072
01:09:50,459 --> 01:09:52,250
Then who's Do Min Joon?

1073
01:09:54,072 --> 01:09:55,838
I'm Do Min Joon.

1074
01:09:55,839 --> 01:09:57,652
I'm Do Min Joon!

1075
01:09:59,612 --> 01:10:01,514
I'm Manager Do!

1076
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:06,196
What is this?

1077
01:10:07,416 --> 01:10:11,197
[Even the evil Mr. Capable is feeling
the pressure with the ringing bell sound.]

1078
01:10:12,900 --> 01:10:16,970
[But Cheon Song Yi is still feeling
unsure of what's going on.]

1079
01:10:16,971 --> 01:10:19,041
See?
I look like him.

1080
01:10:19,042 --> 01:10:23,456
I have so many powers right now.
I can teleport, stop time, and move time.

1081
01:10:23,457 --> 01:10:26,993
- I can teleport, stop time and...
- Stop time?

1082
01:10:27,599 --> 01:10:29,687
But I can't eliminate any name tags
by freezing time.

1083
01:10:30,620 --> 01:10:34,362
[But he can't use his powers to
eliminate anyone's name tag.]

1084
01:10:34,363 --> 01:10:39,321
[But he possesses the great power to escape
from the danger of being eliminated.]

1085
01:10:39,322 --> 01:10:41,745
- Then it's game over.
- But only I can use the powers.

1086
01:10:42,493 --> 01:10:45,552
- Song Yi can't use the powers.
- Then did I just get dumped?

1087
01:10:46,764 --> 01:10:49,916
[Already wondering about the strength of
their love three minutes later?]

1088
01:10:49,917 --> 01:10:52,300
Let's make a clean break after
we get our hands on the gold.

1089
01:10:52,301 --> 01:10:55,103
- Okay, gold, and it's over.
- We're just in this for the gold.

1090
01:10:55,639 --> 01:10:58,197
We're different from the drama,
because this is a variety show.

1091
01:10:58,198 --> 01:11:00,556
[A little bit of a different feel
than the actual drama.]

1092
01:11:00,557 --> 01:11:04,008
We'll take one picture as proof,
and we'll go our own separate ways.

1093
01:11:04,009 --> 01:11:07,316
[It's goodbye as soon as they get
the gold in their hands.]

1094
01:11:07,804 --> 01:11:09,588
I will protect you.

1095
01:11:09,589 --> 01:11:11,886
- I won't leave you for a second.
- Sorry to tell you this...

1096
01:11:12,918 --> 01:11:15,784
But I'm the feisty type.

1097
01:11:16,334 --> 01:11:19,482
- I'm not the lovey dovey type.
- We have to get the gold first.

1098
01:11:19,483 --> 01:11:21,804
- I got it.
- You got it?

1099
01:11:21,983 --> 01:11:24,632
[This is an extremely incompatible
Cheon Song Yi and Do Min Joon.]

1100
01:11:25,054 --> 01:11:26,685
I have to find it quickly.

1101
01:11:27,668 --> 01:11:32,602
[Evil Mr. Capable is on the search for
the rings in order to oust the members.]

1102
01:11:32,603 --> 01:11:35,129
I have to find them quickly.
I have to find the rings.

1103
01:11:40,001 --> 01:11:44,026
[He can only oust the person who's name
is engraved on the ring he finds.]

1104
01:11:51,286 --> 01:11:53,313
[Bingo!]

1105
01:11:56,086 --> 01:11:58,043
Wow, I can't believe how well
you hid this.

1106
01:11:59,174 --> 01:12:02,848
[The ultimate evil finds another ring box!]

1107
01:12:02,849 --> 01:12:07,129
[Who's name will he find on the ring?]

1108
01:12:07,130 --> 01:12:08,431
Who is it?

1109
01:12:08,432 --> 01:12:09,758
Who could it be?

1110
01:12:12,362 --> 01:12:14,381
Cheon Song Yi!

1111
01:12:14,382 --> 01:12:17,288
[Cheon Song Yi!]

1112
01:12:18,106 --> 01:12:20,942
[Evil Mr. Capable is given the chance
to oust Cheon Song Yi!]

1113
01:12:22,660 --> 01:12:24,827
I've been given the chance to catch you.

1114
01:12:25,312 --> 01:12:28,165
[Cheon Song Yi from 400 years ago who
ripped off my identity tag...]

1115
01:12:28,166 --> 01:12:29,785
Wait for me, Cheon Song Yi.

1116
01:12:29,786 --> 01:12:31,209
I'm coming for you.

1117
01:12:34,941 --> 01:12:38,965
[Meanwhile, Song Yi and Min Joon
come across Min Joon wannabe, Giraffe.]

1118
01:12:42,634 --> 01:12:45,681
- Manager Do. Manager Do!
- Jae Suk.

1119
01:12:45,682 --> 01:12:49,586
[Their plan is to keep
Ha Ha's identity a secret.]

1120
01:12:49,587 --> 01:12:52,359
- Aren't you Manager Do?
- Who else besides me is Manager Do?

1121
01:12:52,360 --> 01:12:55,568
- Where are you going?
- I'm running away because I'm nervous.

1122
01:12:55,569 --> 01:12:58,023
[Ha Min Joon is keeping his ears to the ground
to be alerted to any sign of danger.]

1123
01:12:58,024 --> 01:12:59,963
Wait, listen to me.
Kwang Soo.

1124
01:12:59,964 --> 01:13:04,636
[Nervous Kwang Soo keeps retreating
from an uneasy feeling that he's getting.]

1125
01:13:04,637 --> 01:13:06,512
Where's the UFO?

1126
01:13:06,513 --> 01:13:08,456
Song Yi!
Please don't do this to me.

1127
01:13:08,457 --> 01:13:10,828
Don't close in on me so suddenly like this.

1128
01:13:10,829 --> 01:13:12,844
I'm just asking where the spaceship is.

1129
01:13:12,845 --> 01:13:15,129
Who is it?
Is it Jong Kook or Ha Ha?

1130
01:13:15,130 --> 01:13:17,126
[Just then, evil Mr. Capable
walks onto the scene.]

1131
01:13:17,127 --> 01:13:19,016
- It's Ha Ha, isn't it?
- It's not you?

1132
01:13:19,017 --> 01:13:20,648
No, it's not me.

1133
01:13:20,649 --> 01:13:22,062
It's Ha Ha, isn't it?

1134
01:13:22,063 --> 01:13:25,948
[Ha Min Joon, afraid of Song Yi getting
ousted joins the fray as well.]

1135
01:13:25,949 --> 01:13:28,884
Wait, I know that he's Do Min Joon.
It's not me.

1136
01:13:28,885 --> 01:13:30,936
- I swear it isn't me, Kwang Soo.
- It's one of you two.

1137
01:13:30,937 --> 01:13:33,384
- I don't want anyone getting close to me!
- Kwang Soo.

1138
01:13:33,794 --> 01:13:36,443
Trust me, Kwang Soo.
I'm not Do Min Joon.

1139
01:13:36,444 --> 01:13:38,261
I swear that I'm not Do Min Joon.

1140
01:13:38,751 --> 01:13:42,146
Kwang Soo... which of these two
do you think is Do Min Joon?

1141
01:13:42,147 --> 01:13:46,036
[Cheon Song Yi and Ha Min Joon are trying to
argue that Mr. Capable is Do Min Joon.]

1142
01:13:46,037 --> 01:13:51,602
[To keep Jong Kook and Kwang Soo
from joining their forces together.]

1143
01:13:51,603 --> 01:13:54,528
- You know you're lying!
- Where are Ji Hyo and Suk Jin?

1144
01:13:54,529 --> 01:13:56,497
Where did everyone go?

1145
01:13:56,498 --> 01:13:58,705
Where are Ji Hyo and Suk Jin?

1146
01:13:58,706 --> 01:14:01,037
- Why are you asking us that?
- What do you mean, 'us'?

1147
01:14:01,038 --> 01:14:03,873
- I was just asking you.
- No, you asked that of Kwang Soo and I.

1148
01:14:03,874 --> 01:14:06,296
No, I wasn't asking Kwang Soo.
I was just asking you.

1149
01:14:06,881 --> 01:14:08,605
Come on, Kwang Soo.

1150
01:14:08,606 --> 01:14:14,347
[Jae Suk is doing whatever he can to get
Kwang Soo to be suspicious of Jong Kook.]

1151
01:14:14,348 --> 01:14:15,903
- I have no idea what to do.
- Kwang Soo.

1152
01:14:17,425 --> 01:14:19,034
Do Min Joon.

1153
01:14:19,511 --> 01:14:26,196
Why without any permission from me...
did you oust Gary, Ji Hyo and Suk Jin?

1154
01:14:26,641 --> 01:14:29,129
- What is it that you're after?
- Ji Hyo and Suk Jin are ousted?

1155
01:14:29,869 --> 01:14:32,603
- Just what is it that you're after?
- Ji Hyo and Suk Jin are ousted?

1156
01:14:35,046 --> 01:14:40,696
[Cheon Song Yi is trying to paint Mr. Capable
as the traitorous Do Min Joon.]

1157
01:14:41,140 --> 01:14:43,868
Take a good look.
What do you think is going on right now?

1158
01:14:44,322 --> 01:14:45,383
What do you think that he is doing?

1159
01:14:45,384 --> 01:14:48,371
He's trying to get you to think
that I'm Do Min Joon.

1160
01:14:48,372 --> 01:14:51,799
- No, I'm not.
- And he'll oust us with the real Min Joon.

1161
01:14:51,800 --> 01:14:55,378
[Evil Mr. Capable is figuring out
what Jae Suk is really planning.]

1162
01:14:55,975 --> 01:14:58,708
- Dot' you think that I'm right?
- Have you found the key?

1163
01:14:58,709 --> 01:15:00,827
No, I haven't found the key.

1164
01:15:00,828 --> 01:15:03,037
These two could already have the key.

1165
01:15:03,038 --> 01:15:05,311
Gary and I talked earlier.

1166
01:15:05,312 --> 01:15:11,382
We thought that the key could be hidden under
Song Yi or Min Joon's name tag.

1167
01:15:11,383 --> 01:15:13,764
Then how about I see
what's under your name tag?

1168
01:15:14,896 --> 01:15:18,681
- Why do I have to show you my back?
- Did you see his reaction?

1169
01:15:18,682 --> 01:15:20,947
If I'm Do Min Joon,
why would he be so afraid of me?

1170
01:15:20,948 --> 01:15:23,510
Because I could be ousted even if
Do Min Joon is the one eliminating it.

1171
01:15:23,511 --> 01:15:26,104
But Cheon Song Yi had to board
the ship with Do Min Joon.

1172
01:15:26,392 --> 01:15:28,780
[Just then, Mr. Capable comes down
one step closer towards Song Yi.]

1173
01:15:30,059 --> 01:15:33,856
[Evil Mr. Capable already has
Song Yi's ring in his possession.]

1174
01:15:33,857 --> 01:15:38,856
[Thus, he is able to oust Song Yi!]

1175
01:15:41,611 --> 01:15:43,715
Song Yi or Min Joon can board
the ship by themselves.

1176
01:15:43,716 --> 01:15:46,123
Anyone can board the ship by themselves
if they want to keep the gold for themselves.

1177
01:15:46,124 --> 01:15:50,510
[Mr. Capable's hand is slowly...]

1178
01:15:50,961 --> 01:15:54,720
[No... Song Yi...]

1179
01:15:54,721 --> 01:15:56,820
Stop the time.

1180
01:15:58,321 --> 01:16:02,804
[Do Min Joon activates his
time stopping power.]

1181
01:16:11,875 --> 01:16:17,242
[Ha Min Joon stops time to
protect Song Yi.]

1182
01:16:20,418 --> 01:16:22,707
[Rescues Song Yi from danger
while the time has come to a halt.]

1183
01:16:25,886 --> 01:16:32,697
[Time halt... over!]

1184
01:16:32,698 --> 01:16:33,990
See?
Ha Ha is Do Min Joon!

1185
01:16:33,991 --> 01:16:36,991
- Cheon Song Yi!
- Stop looking for Song Yi!

1186
01:16:36,992 --> 01:16:40,019
- Where did you go, Song Yi?
- What are you doing?

1187
01:16:40,869 --> 01:16:44,082
[But Evil Mr. Capable is now aware of
Do Min Joon's superpowers.]

1188
01:16:44,083 --> 01:16:47,173
[Do Min Joon... must be eliminated.]

1189
01:16:48,704 --> 01:16:51,840
[One minute ago- What really happened.]

1190
01:16:53,123 --> 01:16:55,528
Stop the time.

1191
01:16:57,048 --> 01:16:59,979
- Why do you keep...
- What's going on here?

1192
01:17:01,837 --> 01:17:05,904
[The board team is on the move!
Min Joon's power is activated!]

1193
01:17:09,260 --> 01:17:11,459
Come on.
Get on my back.

1194
01:17:15,707 --> 01:17:18,473
- Why didn't you oust him?
- Why are you being so outspoken?

1195
01:17:20,988 --> 01:17:25,142
- Why aren't you ousting him?
- Why do you keep butting in like that?

1196
01:17:33,737 --> 01:17:37,108
- I don't think he would've ousted me.
- He almost had you.

1197
01:17:37,109 --> 01:17:40,748
- I won't die.
- You will die!

1198
01:17:40,749 --> 01:17:43,248
If it hadn't been for me,
you would be ousted by now.

1199
01:17:43,249 --> 01:17:46,030
- I'm telling you that I won't die.
- Yes, you can die.

1200
01:17:46,031 --> 01:17:49,061
- There's nothing for me to be afraid of.
- Why won't you be afraid of anything?

1201
01:17:49,386 --> 01:17:53,145
I thought that this was a part of the coat,
but this is just a scarf.

1202
01:17:53,146 --> 01:17:55,184
[It's a cheap knockoff...]

1203
01:17:55,877 --> 01:17:57,636
What are you going to do?
Tell me.

1204
01:17:57,637 --> 01:18:00,732
[Nothing about this couple is compatible.]

1205
01:18:00,733 --> 01:18:02,936
What we have is
a business relationship, not love.

1206
01:18:03,447 --> 01:18:05,460
Let's just do what we need to do,
and go our separate ways.

1207
01:18:05,461 --> 01:18:07,092
That's a given.

1208
01:18:08,177 --> 01:18:11,127
And I'm pretty offended right now.
Do you know how old I am?

1209
01:18:11,128 --> 01:18:13,309
- How old are you?
- I'm 401 years old.

1210
01:18:15,218 --> 01:18:17,815
Let's just get on the UFO, and go our
separate ways after we get the gold.

1211
01:18:19,076 --> 01:18:22,259
[They no longer even
want to be around each other.]

1212
01:18:22,260 --> 01:18:24,338
Where are you going by yourself again?

1213
01:18:25,381 --> 01:18:29,117
[It's almost time for the door to open...]

1214
01:18:29,952 --> 01:18:33,370
[Evil Mr. Capable is starting to
feel really anxious.]

1215
01:18:35,346 --> 01:18:37,927
[Must find Do Min Joon's nail ring
as quickly as possible.]

1216
01:18:43,563 --> 01:18:46,735
[Could it be?]

1217
01:18:50,098 --> 01:18:53,691
[Nail ring with Ha Ha's name on it!]

1218
01:18:53,692 --> 01:18:54,957
Do Min Joon.

1219
01:18:55,534 --> 01:18:58,193
The only reason why you're still alive...

1220
01:18:58,616 --> 01:19:00,570
is because I let you live until now.

1221
01:19:01,505 --> 01:19:04,523
[You'd better watch yourself, Do Min Joon.]

1222
01:19:06,182 --> 01:19:09,768
[Unable to trust anyone else,
but they're going into hiding for now.]

1223
01:19:10,526 --> 01:19:12,573
Here's what I think.

1224
01:19:12,574 --> 01:19:16,370
I searched everywhere
for over an hour earlier.

1225
01:19:16,371 --> 01:19:21,226
But I couldn't find anything.
Even the hairpin was found on a person.

1226
01:19:21,227 --> 01:19:23,939
Remember the hairpin
during our first mission of the day?

1227
01:19:25,005 --> 01:19:29,416
[The jade hairpin that the younger version
of Song Yi was wearing in her hair.]

1228
01:19:30,665 --> 01:19:34,375
I think it's on us somewhere.
You could have it, or I could have it.

1229
01:19:34,376 --> 01:19:35,693
The hairpin?

1230
01:19:36,375 --> 01:19:37,755
No, the key.

1231
01:19:37,756 --> 01:19:41,313
- The key?
- The key could be on our person.

1232
01:19:41,314 --> 01:19:44,037
So let's just search through
our own clothing.

1233
01:19:52,201 --> 01:19:55,064
[Where are you, Do Min Joon?]

1234
01:19:55,065 --> 01:19:56,965
It's not there.
I looked everywhere.

1235
01:20:01,783 --> 01:20:03,495
Here it is.

1236
01:20:03,496 --> 01:20:05,105
We have to rip it.

1237
01:20:07,331 --> 01:20:10,843
[There's something inside Song Yi's coat...]

1238
01:20:11,531 --> 01:20:12,927
This is it.

1239
01:20:18,441 --> 01:20:21,307
[A USB key for the door to the UFO!]

1240
01:20:21,308 --> 01:20:23,069
How did you expect us to find this?

1241
01:20:23,323 --> 01:20:26,171
[Did you think that it would be that easy
to fly into outer space?]

1242
01:20:26,172 --> 01:20:29,349
Since we now have the key...
all we have to do is find the UFO.

1243
01:20:29,350 --> 01:20:31,998
[Find the UFO,
and they can return to Planet Gold!]

1244
01:20:33,877 --> 01:20:36,465
- We're going to be together.
- I know we are, but...

1245
01:20:37,215 --> 01:20:40,665
[The foundation of their love is being
shaken in front of the UFO key?]

1246
01:20:40,666 --> 01:20:42,323
You have to listen to me from
now on, okay?

1247
01:20:43,495 --> 01:20:46,159
[Ha Min Joon is feeling mighty cocky
after having found the key.]

1248
01:20:46,160 --> 01:20:48,767
You are such an impish little woman.
Stop running around recklessly.

1249
01:20:48,768 --> 01:20:51,185
You're driving me crazy.
It's over once we get the gold.

1250
01:20:53,281 --> 01:20:55,252
I have no reason to see you anymore
once I get the gold.

1251
01:20:58,168 --> 01:21:02,499
[All they need to do now is find
the UFO that's outside the building.]

1252
01:21:09,431 --> 01:21:11,118
Why don't you come here?

1253
01:21:12,273 --> 01:21:17,724
You ousted Gary, Ji Hyo and even Suk Jin,
didn't you?

1254
01:21:17,725 --> 01:21:20,176
- What are you talking about?
- What am I talking about?

1255
01:21:20,177 --> 01:21:22,041
I was with you most of the day.

1256
01:21:23,147 --> 01:21:27,912
[What luck is this?]

1257
01:21:29,501 --> 01:21:33,765
It's because you want to keep the gold,
and the UFO for yourself.

1258
01:21:33,766 --> 01:21:35,399
[Suspecting Kwang Soo of everything.]

1259
01:21:35,400 --> 01:21:37,685
[That's why you should be
nicer all the time...]

1260
01:21:39,003 --> 01:21:46,040
[Alien Ha Min Joon is getting ready to
activate one of his superpowers.]

1261
01:21:46,041 --> 01:21:49,127
You dare antagonize my lady, Cheon Song Yi?

1262
01:21:50,130 --> 01:21:52,169
I will not let you get away with it.

1263
01:21:54,774 --> 01:21:57,079
[Superpower- Activated!]

1264
01:22:00,163 --> 01:22:01,723
What is all this?

1265
01:22:03,857 --> 01:22:05,159
What is this?

1266
01:22:06,013 --> 01:22:07,347
What are you doing?

1267
01:22:07,348 --> 01:22:10,319
[This is none other than,
rubber ball thunder!]

1268
01:22:10,320 --> 01:22:12,009
Wait!

1269
01:22:12,010 --> 01:22:14,955
What is this?
What are you doing?

1270
01:22:14,956 --> 01:22:16,664
<i>You can't do this!</i>

1271
01:22:18,624 --> 01:22:19,925
I just got hit.

1272
01:22:21,214 --> 01:22:24,303
[Taking advantage of the chaos to
attack Kwang Soo to eliminate him.]

1273
01:22:24,910 --> 01:22:27,831
[A full force attack on the lonely Giraffe.]

1274
01:22:29,098 --> 01:22:31,931
- There's no time, Jong Kook!
- Stop the time!

1275
01:22:31,932 --> 01:22:34,747
[This won't do... Stop the time!]

1276
01:22:36,891 --> 01:22:39,877
[Flow of time... come to a halt.]

1277
01:22:41,175 --> 01:22:47,475
[While everyone comes to a stop...
only Ha Ha is able to make a move.]

1278
01:22:47,476 --> 01:22:50,101
[Comes to stop right behind Kwang Soo.]

1279
01:22:55,532 --> 01:22:59,413
[Kwang Soo is ousted the moment
that time starts to flow again.]

1280
01:23:01,927 --> 01:23:04,976
Cheon Song Yi?
Cheon Song Yi, my butt.

1281
01:23:08,180 --> 01:23:10,573
- Just let it go, Song Yi.
- Let go of me.

1282
01:23:12,581 --> 01:23:15,259
[Song Yi, the fighter?]

1283
01:23:18,009 --> 01:23:21,382
[Puts up a good fight to the end,
and Kwang Soo is out!]

1284
01:23:22,230 --> 01:23:25,085
Any mistake, and both of us
could've been out.

1285
01:23:25,086 --> 01:23:27,065
- If you hadn't done that...
- There's Jong Kook.

1286
01:23:28,783 --> 01:23:32,228
[Discovers Mr. Capable in hiding!]

1287
01:23:34,566 --> 01:23:38,433
[The final face-off,
Song Yi and Min Joon vs Evil Mr. Capable.]

1288
01:23:44,594 --> 01:23:48,505
Mr. Capable coming down the stairs
to corner the two.]

1289
01:23:57,965 --> 01:24:01,639
[What is that chill in the air?]

1290
01:24:07,405 --> 01:24:11,361
[The three face off with one another!]

1291
01:24:14,057 --> 01:24:17,201
- Where did Kwang Soo go?
- Isn't Kwang Soo playing Jae Kyung?

1292
01:24:17,784 --> 01:24:19,223
What did you say?

1293
01:24:19,224 --> 01:24:21,220
There's a bad guy?

1294
01:24:31,299 --> 01:24:37,651
[What he pulls out of his jacket...
are the two rings with their names on it.]

1295
01:24:38,980 --> 01:24:41,040
[That's right...]

1296
01:24:41,041 --> 01:24:47,671
[I'm... the ultimate force of evil.]

1297
01:24:51,782 --> 01:24:56,904
- I will send you off into your eternal rest.
- Why are you talking in such a scary way?

1298
01:24:58,037 --> 01:25:01,934
Why are you wearing a nail around your finger?
You're wearing that as a ring?

1299
01:25:01,935 --> 01:25:06,736
The reason why you're both still alive...
is because I let you live up to now.

1300
01:25:06,737 --> 01:25:10,288
- Yes, I don't doubt your words.
- Did you oust Gary and everyone else?

1301
01:25:10,289 --> 01:25:12,088
I ousted everyone.

1302
01:25:12,755 --> 01:25:14,846
[Goodbye, Gary.]

1303
01:25:14,847 --> 01:25:17,214
- What about Suk Jin?
- Suk Jin too.

1304
01:25:17,215 --> 01:25:19,055
- You're so frightening.
- You can't do that.

1305
01:25:19,056 --> 01:25:21,040
[Time for you to go
and get some rest, Suk Jin.]

1306
01:25:21,041 --> 01:25:24,277
- What about Ji Hyo?
- Ji Hyo was first.

1307
01:25:25,130 --> 01:25:27,365
[As soon as she told me about the evil...]

1308
01:25:28,744 --> 01:25:32,490
[Do you remember, Song Yi?]

1309
01:25:32,491 --> 01:25:37,108
[The promise I made you 400 years ago?]

1310
01:25:37,109 --> 01:25:39,068
You can't kill me.

1311
01:25:39,069 --> 01:25:42,493
[Song Yi's protector, Min Joon vs
Force of evil trying to rid of Song Yi.]

1312
01:25:42,494 --> 01:25:44,697
- Because you can't kill me.
- Why not?

1313
01:25:45,614 --> 01:25:47,616
Stop the time!

1314
01:25:54,952 --> 01:25:56,858
Stop the time!

1315
01:25:56,859 --> 01:26:00,407
[The time stopping agents are on the move!]

1316
01:26:00,408 --> 01:26:01,927
Sorry.

1317
01:26:04,486 --> 01:26:06,519
I thought that my jaw was going to break.

1318
01:26:07,680 --> 01:26:09,911
Teleportation!

1319
01:26:09,912 --> 01:26:11,738
[One more- Teleportation.]

1320
01:26:12,591 --> 01:26:15,202
[Everyone moves at an incredibly slow speed
with the exception of Ha Min Joon.]

1321
01:26:15,203 --> 01:26:18,245
[But he still continues to protect Song Yi.]

1322
01:26:20,748 --> 01:26:23,374
- Song Yi.
- What are you doing? You have to oust him.

1323
01:26:23,375 --> 01:26:25,431
I told you that I can't oust anyone
while the time is at a standstill.

1324
01:26:28,693 --> 01:26:30,742
I just need to get Do Min Joon's mouth shut.

1325
01:26:31,531 --> 01:26:33,038
We've only got three minutes left.

1326
01:26:33,039 --> 01:26:36,343
[Only three minutes left until
the UFO door opens.]

1327
01:26:36,344 --> 01:26:39,373
- You'll never be able to kill me.
- He's really angry.

1328
01:26:40,501 --> 01:26:41,927
[The ultimate force of evil is on the move!]

1329
01:26:41,928 --> 01:26:43,647
Use your power!

1330
01:26:45,951 --> 01:26:48,420
[But this beast doesn't even blink an eye!]

1331
01:26:52,869 --> 01:26:57,292
[Are you done with your tricks now?]

1332
01:27:02,418 --> 01:27:05,204
[UFO is activated.]

1333
01:27:06,875 --> 01:27:10,574
[The final battle they must fight!]

1334
01:27:10,575 --> 01:27:14,977
[Will Song Yi and Min Joon be able to hold on
to their love 400 years in the making?]

1335
01:27:17,055 --> 01:27:18,714
[Just then]

1336
01:27:23,691 --> 01:27:28,037
[Ha Min Joon... is ousted.]

1337
01:27:28,038 --> 01:27:29,938
I was so close... so close!

1338
01:27:33,834 --> 01:27:35,932
Song Yi!

1339
01:27:35,933 --> 01:27:39,519
[I'm sorry that I wasn't able to
protect you.]

1340
01:27:41,214 --> 01:27:48,917
[I've waited 400 years for this UFO.
Must I wait another 400 years?]

1341
01:27:50,716 --> 01:27:55,147
[The final battle-
Cheon Song Yi vs Ultimate force of evil.]

1342
01:27:55,148 --> 01:27:57,056
I should've finished you off 400 years ago
when I had the chance!

1343
01:28:01,958 --> 01:28:05,998
[Their fate 400 years in the making...]

1344
01:28:05,999 --> 01:28:10,752
[It's time to end it now!]

1345
01:28:10,753 --> 01:28:12,992
I didn't know that you were Jae Kyung.

1346
01:28:12,993 --> 01:28:16,026
- I had no idea that you were Jae Kyung.
- You need to put the wig back on.

1347
01:28:17,104 --> 01:28:19,796
[Even in this current situation,
comments about his ugliness must be made.]

1348
01:28:20,614 --> 01:28:23,737
[Wig headed Cheon Song Yi vs
Ultimate Force of Evil Mr. Capable.]

1349
01:28:23,738 --> 01:28:26,680
Song Yi!

1350
01:28:26,681 --> 01:28:28,283
[A bloody battle]

1351
01:28:34,953 --> 01:28:39,707
[Time... to... end this now.]

1352
01:28:43,904 --> 01:28:47,207
[Totally unexpected!]

1353
01:28:47,208 --> 01:28:51,575
[Cheon Song Yi eliminates Mr. Capable's
name tag first!]

1354
01:28:53,893 --> 01:28:57,833
[History repeats itself 400 years later!]

1355
01:29:00,446 --> 01:29:04,394
[Mr. Capable's energy is depleted
after the two against one battle.]

1356
01:29:04,395 --> 01:29:06,034
You worked hard, Jae Kyung.

1357
01:29:06,035 --> 01:29:07,944
You worked hard...

1358
01:29:08,403 --> 01:29:10,609
but you just got dumped.

1359
01:29:11,674 --> 01:29:15,050
[Sorry, Mr. Capable.]

1360
01:29:18,217 --> 01:29:20,682
[In the end, Song Yi heads off to
board the UFO by herself.]

1361
01:29:20,683 --> 01:29:23,270
I can't believe that just happened.

1362
01:29:26,614 --> 01:29:29,226
It would've been so nice if
Min Joon could've been here with me.

1363
01:29:29,227 --> 01:29:33,987
Do Min Joon... I'm sorry.
And Kwang Soo, what were you playing today?

1364
01:29:33,988 --> 01:29:35,997
What role were you playing?

1365
01:29:35,998 --> 01:29:39,221
Anyways, I'm so happy with the outcome.

1366
01:29:40,655 --> 01:29:45,231
[He only has to fit the key
in the lock of the door.]

1367
01:29:49,404 --> 01:29:51,095
Why isn't the door opening?

1368
01:29:52,123 --> 01:29:54,191
[The door is opening!]

1369
01:29:55,349 --> 01:29:58,151
What a miracle!

1370
01:29:58,933 --> 01:30:01,133
What a miracle!

1371
01:30:07,609 --> 01:30:10,245
[Cheon Song Yi boards the UFO.]

1372
01:30:11,695 --> 01:30:15,845
[His long awaited gold prize inside the UFO.]

1373
01:30:29,240 --> 01:30:31,787
[My Love From a Running Star...
Sequel in 400 years.]

1374
01:30:32,942 --> 01:30:34,479
Song Yi!

1375
01:30:35,091 --> 01:30:38,551
- Song Yi!
- I'm coming!

1376
01:30:39,709 --> 01:30:41,597
- What is this?
- Thanks!

1377
01:30:41,598 --> 01:30:45,027
Why are you closing the door?
Why are you leaving me?

1378
01:30:45,028 --> 01:30:47,620
Why would you take this back
to my planet?

1379
01:30:47,621 --> 01:30:50,489
- Min Joon!
- You're an earthling!

1380
01:30:50,490 --> 01:30:53,141
- I'm sorry, Min Joon.
- I should be the one leaving!

1381
01:30:53,142 --> 01:30:56,019
You should find yourself another woman.

1382
01:30:56,020 --> 01:31:00,058
[Chung Song Yi is leaving Do Min Joon behind
to leave for outer space herself.]

1383
01:31:00,059 --> 01:31:03,648
<i>Cheon Song Yi is wrapping,
mem mem mem...</i>

1384
01:31:05,234 --> 01:31:07,749
[How can this be?]

1385
01:31:09,727 --> 01:31:11,195
Let's go.

1386
01:31:11,196 --> 01:31:13,884
Where are you going, Song Yi?

1387
01:31:13,885 --> 01:31:16,570
No, I should be the one leaving!

1388
01:31:16,571 --> 01:31:20,197
Song Yi!
Cheon Song Yi!
