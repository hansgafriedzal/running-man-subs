01:04:36,625 --> 01:04:39,300
That's it! That's it!

1012
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:45,075
Does it take this long?

1013
01:04:45,075 --> 01:04:48,795
<i>[Fierce competition on Mr. Cylinder Game.]</i>

1014
01:04:48,795 --> 01:04:51,080
- No, no!
- This one?

1015
01:04:55,290 --> 01:04:59,355
<i>[Was this... such a fierce game?]</i>

1016
01:05:06,375 --> 01:05:09,825
<i>[Lucky guy Jong Hyun with a scream.]</i>

1017
01:05:11,560 --> 01:05:12,955
Fighting!

1018
01:05:12,955 --> 01:05:18,380
Ji Suk, if Ji Hyo doesn't get it this time,
her team will pass.

1019
01:05:18,380 --> 01:05:20,545
We only have three left.

1020
01:05:20,545 --> 01:05:23,440
Ji Hyo's team will make it.

1021
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:27,780
<i>[If it's not Ji Hyo,
then it's one of the two.]</i>

1022

<i>[Careful]</i>

1023
01:05:33,015 --> 01:05:37,840
Ji Hyo, just do it. You shouldn't think.

1024
01:05:37,840 --> 01:05:40,620
This is the new unlucky celebrity.

1025
01:05:40,620 --> 01:05:42,485
He's the old unlucky celebrity.

1026
01:05:42,485 --> 01:05:45,615
This is the meeting of the old
and the new.

1027
01:05:45,615 --> 01:05:47,485
Ji Hyo, it's okay. You can do it!

1028
01:05:47,485 --> 01:05:52,400
<i>[Moment of fate]</i>

1029

You didn't touch anything, did you?

1033
01:06:29,905 --> 01:06:32,180
Good job!

1034
01:06:32,180 --> 01:06:34,870
- We can do it, Ji Hyo. It's okay.
- We can do it.

1035
01:06:34,870 --> 01:06:36,605
This is not important.

1036
01:06:36,605 --> 01:06:39,565

Big Nose and Jong Hyun.]</i>

1037

a hefty 10 medals.]</i>

1038

<i>[Plus it seems they have a
secret game.]</i>

1039
01:06:46,895 --> 01:06:48,175
I'll go first.

1040
01:06:48,175 --> 01:06:51,410
<i>[Jong Hyun's speedy success.]</i>

1041
01:06:57,430 --> 01:07:00,230
<i>[No way!]</i>

1042

<i>[In only two moves!]</i>

1043
01:07:10,055 --> 01:07:13,860
<i>[It took so long just now...
but in two moves...]</i>

1044

<i>[The icon of misfortune, Big Nose,
even recognized by the God of Variety.]</i>

1045

<i>[Surprising results
the more you think about it.]</i>

1046
01:07:27,590 --> 01:07:30,455
I think your variety shows will go
well this year, but...

1047
01:07:30,455 --> 01:07:34,220
So the medals from Yellow Team
will be taken away, too.

1048
01:07:34,220 --> 01:07:37,860
<i>Blue Team will take six medals.</i>

1049
01:07:37,860 --> 01:07:41,010
<i>[Blue Team earns medals!]</i>

1050
01:07:46,675 --> 01:07:49,880
<i>[The shock is not going away...]</i>

1051
01:07:49,880 --> 01:07:53,110
<i>We have two more games left.</i>

1052
01:07:53,110 --> 01:07:55,980
<i>Blue Team can choose a game again.</i>

1053
01:07:55,980 --> 01:07:59,815
<i>When I say one, two, three,
yell it out together!</i>

1054
01:07:59,815 --> 01:08:03,135
One, two, three! Titanic game!

1055
01:08:03,135 --> 01:08:04,700
Okay!

1056
01:08:05,865 --> 01:08:08,620
<i>[Why a water tank?]</i>

1057
01:08:08,620 --> 01:08:12,385
<i>[It doesn't look like a game
that requires physical strength.]</i>

1058
01:08:12,385 --> 01:08:14,700
<i>Now I will explain it to you.</i>

1059
01:08:14,700 --> 01:08:18,625
<i>There is a small glass bowl in the
water tank.</i>

1060
01:08:18,625 --> 01:08:24,000
<i>Everyone will take turns and add in
a marble in the bowl.</i>

1061
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,205
<i>The bowl will get heavier.</i>

1062
01:08:26,205 --> 01:08:33,475
<i>[The team that sinks the bowl loses!]</i>

1063
01:08:33,475 --> 01:08:35,130
- That's what Titanic meant!
- That's interesting!

1064
01:08:35,130 --> 01:08:38,770
<i>[Sinking glass ship!
That's why it's Titanic!]</i>

1065
01:08:38,770 --> 01:08:42,090
<i>[Picking the player for the Titanic Game.]</i>

1066

<i>[Blue Team's Min Hyuk is up!]</i>

1067
01:08:45,425 --> 01:08:48,145
- One, two, three!
- It's me!

1068
01:08:48,145 --> 01:08:50,795
<i>[Yellow Team's Gary is chosen!]</i>

1069
01:08:50,795 --> 01:08:53,395
- You can do it!
- I can do it! I can do it!

1070
01:08:56,205 --> 01:08:58,635
I hope it's Eun Kyung.

1071
01:09:00,107 --> 01:09:02,805
<i>[Kwang Ja got picked.]</i>

1072
01:09:02,805 --> 01:09:06,060
That's great! He is the unluckiest one
in that team.

1073
01:09:08,685 --> 01:09:11,060
<i>[Red Team is in crisis mode after
placing last in the previous game.]</i>

1074
01:09:11,060 --> 01:09:14,350
<i>[Yellow Team plays hard with five.]</i>

1075
01:09:16,720 --> 01:09:19,100
<i>[Three each for Blue Team and Red Team.]</i>

1076
01:09:19,100 --> 01:09:21,600
- You play a timid game.
- We're not timid. We're feminine.

1077
01:09:23,240 --> 01:09:25,615
- Gary, I put my faith in you.
- Okay, okay.

1078
01:09:28,095 --> 01:09:33,810
Kwang Soo, do it right.

1079
01:09:33,810 --> 01:09:37,930
<i>[She's so... worried...]</i>

1080
01:09:37,930 --> 01:09:41,350

<i>[Challenge of determined Kwang Ja.]</i>

1082
01:09:44,115 --> 01:09:45,225
I'm going!

1083

<i>[Kwang Ja makes a bold move and
adds a big marble.]</i>

1084
01:09:52,810 --> 01:09:54,630
Go strong? Okay, let's go strong.

1085
01:09:54,630 --> 01:09:56,195
Go strong.

1086
01:09:57,785 --> 01:10:00,525
<i>[Gary adds another big marble.]</i>

1087
01:10:00,525 --> 01:10:02,600
It can come up to this much.

1088
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:05,055
<i>[They're still relaxed in the beginning.]</i>

1089
01:10:05,055 --> 01:10:08,600
The one after me will get caught.
Not me!

1090
01:10:08,600 --> 01:10:11,735
- You're still fine.
- Then put it over here, on the edge.

1091
01:10:11,735 --> 01:10:14,850
- Put it in the end to balance.
- Once you drop, it's over.

1092
01:10:14,850 --> 01:10:16,645
Why don't you do it, Sister?

1093
01:10:16,645 --> 01:10:19,350
I wanted to be picked!

1094
01:10:27,645 --> 01:10:31,310
Eun Kyung, you should say something
too, about where to put it.

1095
01:10:31,310 --> 01:10:34,700
- This is the first time for me.
- It's first time for all of us.

1096
01:10:34,700 --> 01:10:39,145
<i>[This kind of game is not common...]</i>

1097

<i>[Burst of criticism]</i>

1099
01:10:47,515 --> 01:10:51,185
Play like a man, seriously!

1100
01:10:51,185 --> 01:10:53,455
I'm scared to meet a guy like you.

1101
01:10:53,455 --> 01:10:57,080
I'm afraid to meet a girl like you, too!

1102
01:10:57,080 --> 01:11:00,505
Jae Suk, this is why we broke up.

1103
01:11:02,835 --> 01:11:05,720
<i>[What would be the fate of this glass boat?]</i>

1104
01:11:08,175 --> 01:11:11,170

<i>[The audience wants the presence of
the Variety God on Kwang Ja.]</i>

1106
01:11:15,125 --> 01:11:19,335
Kwang Ja, please save the variety show!

1107
01:11:22,405 --> 01:11:24,265
Put a small one in.

1108
01:11:24,265 --> 01:11:28,100
<i>[As the marble size gets smaller,
hissing gets louder.]</i>

1109
01:11:30,680 --> 01:11:32,285
That's not at all like Kwang Ja.

1110
01:11:32,285 --> 01:11:34,100
Kwang Ja, that's too small.

1111
01:11:34,100 --> 01:11:36,310
- Come back to the old you.
- Is this how big you are?

1112
01:11:36,310 --> 01:11:37,910
Is that your size?

1113
01:11:39,040 --> 01:11:40,835
Why do we have to talk about this?

1114
01:11:40,835 --> 01:11:45,100
Do I have to hear about the size
of my bowl too?

1115
01:11:45,100 --> 01:11:47,820
- Is that the size of your heart?
- Is this game to hurt people?

1116
01:11:47,820 --> 01:11:52,175
This is the size of your
future girlfriend's love for you.

1117
01:11:52,175 --> 01:11:55,790
Can I pick a bigger one?

1118
01:11:55,790 --> 01:11:57,830
Of course!

1119
01:11:57,830 --> 01:12:00,935
Kwang Soo, no!
It's really dangerous.

1120
01:12:02,935 --> 01:12:06,225
<i>[He can't change the marble
once he picked one.]</i>

1121
01:12:08,845 --> 01:12:11,265
Gary, it's really dangerous this time.
Really!

1122
01:12:11,265 --> 01:12:15,995
- It's really heavy. Not this one!
- It's okay.

1123
01:12:15,995 --> 01:12:18,720
Really?

Gary!
Seriously, that's not the right one!

1126
01:12:28,245 --> 01:12:33,050
- It's okay.
- Really? It's okay?

1127
01:12:35,185 --> 01:12:38,075
- It's okay.
- That's not right...

1128
01:12:38,075 --> 01:12:42,535
Wait, stay still! It's moving!

1129
01:12:42,535 --> 01:12:46,200
Stand back!

1130
01:12:46,200 --> 01:12:51,805
You know about life?
Life doesn't fall apart so easily...

1131
01:12:51,805 --> 01:12:55,510
Nice, Gary!

1132
01:12:59,205 --> 01:13:00,800

We're done!

1137
01:13:13,145 --> 01:13:17,080

- We're done!

Right here.

- Put it right here.
- No, Kwang Soo, listen to me. Here.

1141
01:13:29,665 --> 01:13:31,760
Just put it down!

1142

That's okay.

Three, two, one!

1144
01:13:41,780 --> 01:13:43,400
Gary, a small one.

1145
01:13:43,400 --> 01:13:45,460
It's lower than the water level,
but water's not coming in.

- Wait, it's dangerous.
- You have to go fast.
