00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:11,300
[In a few moments...]

5
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:15,070
[A gigantic scaled project will
take place on the Han River.]

6
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:19,480
[7 AM-
Coffee shop near Dong-kuk University.]

7
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,750
- Why isn't anyone else clapping?
- We don't clap when we start.

8
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:28,070
[Even clapping gets Kwang Soo in trouble.]

9
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:32,160
There could be people who may not be
in the best mood when we start filming.

10
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:36,860
- Some people may not be in a good mood.
- Why wouldn't they be in a good mood?

11
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:41,140
We need to make sure to put people in a good
mood as we start filming throughout the day.

12
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:43,690
How can I already be in trouble
when I haven't even said anything yet?

13
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:46,870
Let's all cheers together for a good day.

14
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:48,460
[This is what you call 'timing'.]

15
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:52,650
It's okay.
You're still learning.

16
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:54,630
Just eat some patbingsoo
and be quiet.

17
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:57,750
- Can I just eat then?
- Is this patbingsoo?

18
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:01,720
This really is a delicious cup of coffee.

19
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,890
[Cake and patbingsoo...
their morning brunch.]

20
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:07,830
[He's not even touching anything?]

21
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:09,940
I already had breakfast before I came.

22
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:13,870
I got up at 5AM this morning, so
what time did you get up for breakfast?

23
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:15,760
I got up at 4 AM.

24
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:18,380
- You got up that early?
- I always make sure to have my breakfast.

25
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:21,500
- That's a late night snack.
- I always eat my breakfast.

26
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:24,530
That's not breakfast.
That's more like a really late night snack.

27
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:26,020
Did you stay up all night
just to have breakfast?

28
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:28,650
[Is he that obsessed with breakfast?]

29
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:32,240
I've been hearing some shocking
news lately.

30
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,070
I know that you're trying to keep it a secret,
but we know you've been busy setting up.

31
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:37,560
[Are they sensing something?]

32
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:41,900
- We've been hearing some things.
- We were trying to keep everything a secret.

33
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:45,370
We'll start off by telling you what
your final mission is going to be.

34
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:47,130
[Revealing what
the final mission is going to be.]

35
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,830
You have to cross a river.

36
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:52,650
- Are you serious?
- So it's true!

37
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:55,860
[Today's final mission...]

38
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:59,460
[Crossing the Han River.]

39
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:03,720
You've already crossed the Han River by
building your own boat

40
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,200
so I'm sure you'll all be very good at it.

41
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,010
What do you mean, we're good at it?
Have you not seen our boat capsizing?

42
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:11,360
- We were stuck in the water for 40 minutes.
- I've never experienced anything like that.

43
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:16,220
[Their Han River incident is still fresh
in their minds as if it happened yesterday.]

44
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:20,990
[Their freezing cold Han River experience.]

45
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:24,360
- Do you know how cold the river is right now?
- We did a great job with that.

46
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:28,770
[This time, they won't be
crossing in a paper boat.]

47
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:32,050
[The boat must be made with various
different materials.]

48
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:33,770
How about giving us a huge basin?

49
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:35,990
- What about cotton candy?
- Probably cotton candy and bread.

50
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:38,820
Is there a huge basin?
Seriously?

51
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:40,790
- What did you say?
- A basin. A huge basin.

52
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,500
- What did he say? A prawn?
- We have to cross with a prawn?

53
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:47,140
[How are you going to cross the river
on a prawn?]

54
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:51,160
- We have to ride on a prawn?
- Tie up a thousand prawns together.

55
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:58,330
And this time, you'll be building the boats
together with some special guests.

56
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:00,130
- Who are our guests?
- Please come on in.

57
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:02,810
What's it going to be?

58
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:07,350
[Several pictures are brought in on a table.]

59
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:14,980
[The country's biggest female stars!]

60
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:18,580
- You all must pick a picture that you like.
- Seriously?

61
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:21,270
- Each of you must pick a picture.
- Does it matter which one we pick?

62
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:24,160
- Each of you must choose a picture.
- You go first, Kwang Soo.

63
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,460
- Should I go first?
- Yeah.

64
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:29,530
- I want Lee Hyung Yi.
- I want Yang Hee Eun.

65
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:31,420
- I want Yang Hee Eun.
- No, I want Yang Hee Eun.

66
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:33,590
I have a good feeling about Yang Hee Eun.

67
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:35,360
I'm going with Yang Hee Eun.

68
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,830
[I'm going to go with the one
that the others wants.]

69
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:41,110
- He really is gullible.
- You can't change your mind now.

70
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:42,640
Okay, you go next.

71
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,330
I don't know who to pick.

72
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:45,540
[It's now Gary's turn.]

73
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:48,460
I need to choose the person who has the
biggest chance of actually being on the show.

74
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:52,150
[What kind of a mission is this going to be?]

75
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:54,330
- Go with Yeon Hee.
- That's who Jong Kook wants.

76
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:56,640
You can't worry about that.
You get to pick first.

77
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,340
[Finders keepers.]

78
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:01,240
- Go with Yeon Hee.
- I'm going to pick Goo Ha Ra.

79
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:04,150
[After careful consideration,
Gary chooses Goo Ha Ra.]

80
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:05,630
I don't know anyone else
with that name.

81
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:11,140
Wow, Yeon Hee is like a sister to me.

82
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:14,930
Ji Hyun...
I didn't make it to her wedding.

83
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:17,120
That's because you weren't even invited!

84
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:21,740
[Have you even met her before?]

85
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,750
You need to wake up from your
daydreaming.

86
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:27,800
- Then Jong Kook can have Yeon Hee.
- I want Kim Yeon Ah.

87
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:29,700
- What?
- I want Kim Yeon Ah.

88
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:33,600
I once played a character by that name
in a drama a long time ago

89
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,990
- and I feel like I'm meant to pick her.
- Really?

90
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:37,840
Then I'll pick Kim Yeon Ah.

91
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,820
[Always chooses the one
that someone else wants.]

92
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:44,910
[Four pictures to choose from.]

93
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:48,010
- Ah! You should pick Hyuna.
- You should pick Hyuna.

94
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:49,750
I'll go with Hyuna.

95
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:52,160
[Ji Hyo chooses Hyuna of 4Minute.]

96
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:56,360
If this is what I think it is,
then I think Lee Hyun Yi is right for me.

97
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:59,290
- Then I think...
- I think I want Han Ga In.

98
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:02,030
[Who says?]

99
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:03,300
Then you get Han Ga In,
and I get Jeon Ji Hyun.

100
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:06,080
[Han Ga In for Suk Jin,
and Jeon Ji Hyun for Ha Ha.]

101
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:09,600
[Everyone completes their selection
of their top stars.]

102
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,750
Everyone's finished making their selections.

103
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:14,900
[What is their picture mission?]

104
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:16,690
As mentioned before, you have to make a boat
with various different materials.

105
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:23,550
Starting with Kwang Soo, please take
the sticker off the back of the picture.

106
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:30,120
Seo-Gang University?

107
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:33,620
- That's a university.
- Seriously?

108
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:35,550
[The alma mater of the star in the picture!]

109
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:39,910
[Korea University]

110
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:45,280
[Chung-Ang University]

111
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,320
Not that, but the back of the picture.

112
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:50,220
[Are you trying to take the picture?]

113
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:56,710
[On the back of Han Ga In's picture...]

114
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,550
[Kyung Hee University]

115
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:03,260
Dong-kuk University!
That's right out front!

116
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,950
[Dong-kuk University]

117
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:09,690
[Kun-Kuk  University]

118
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:15,390
Yes!
Seong-Shin Women's University!

119
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,390
[Seong-Shin Women's University]

120
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:20,540
I didn't know that's where Ha Ra went.

121
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:24,150
[Everyone's envious of Gary's selection.]

122
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:27,320
Is mine the only all women's university?

123
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,750
The only place I get any warm reception
is at an all-women's university.

124
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:35,750
You must now go to the university that
you have each chosen

125
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:37,490
and choose a male and a female student
whom you'll complete your mission with.

126
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:43,570
You must choose two teammates
and bring them back with you.

127
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:45,040
Man and a woman?

128
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:48,100
In Song Ji Hyo's case,
she'll have to bring back two males.

129
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:50,710
Then as for me,
I'll have to bring back two females?

130
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:55,210
- Yes, Gary will have to bring back two women.
- Is there a boat making class?

131
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:58,350
- Try an architecture class.
- Ah, architecture class?

132
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:01,320
Then will these students have to cross
the river with us in the boat?

133
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,260
[Must cross the river with the students
that they choose as their teammates.]

134
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:05,580
Then I'll have to choose
students who'll listen to me well.

135
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,920
[Must you really worry about that?]

136
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,940
I think anyone you pick
will listen to you well.

137
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:13,540
The broadcast date
of this episode will be March 2nd.

138
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:14,990
Today's the start of a new semester.

139
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:20,410
That's why we're calling this episode,
'2014 Running Man New Semester Race.'

140
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:24,070
[New Semester Special-
2014 Running Man University Competition.]

141
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:27,020
[Most infamous universities of Korea.]

142
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:30,820
[Team up with smart, and passionate
students of local universities!]

143
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:33,060
[Build a boat out of
various different materials.]

144
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:36,350
[Three people per team.]

145
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:39,410
[The team that crosses the river
quickest will win the race.]

146
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:46,320
Ideas, skills, and teamwork.
You need all three elements to win the race.

147
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:51,870
Find your teammates that possess
all three of these attributes

148
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:54,880
and bring them back with you to join you
on this mission as your teammates.

149
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:56,410
Go.

150
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,100
Okay, let's go!

151
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:02,860
I need to get there quickly and
find the best teammates that I can find.

152
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:05,320
The most important thing is
their creativity.

153
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:10,540
Their passion and ambition is what I need.

154
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:15,570
If I could have my choice,
I'd want a male student like Kwang Soo.

155
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:19,220
And a female student who's like Ji Hyo.

156
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:23,930
As for the male...
I want someone who'll follow my lead well.

157
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:28,070
A guy who's good at following orders.

158
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,100
Someone who's quick on their feet.

159
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:31,920
As for the girl...

160
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:35,990
I would like for her to be...

161
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,680
Someone who can listen, and be cooperative.

162
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,950
A girl who's sweet and cute.

163
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:47,030
[We told them to find their teammates,
not describe their ideal type in a mate.]

164
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:50,420
I want to be able to get along with them
like I would with my family members.

165
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:53,450
Maybe we can meet up on the weekends
and build boats to ride on the Han River.

166
00:08:56,290 --> 00:08:57,570
Yes!

167
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:59,880
[No further words are necessary...]

168
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:03,770
[Everyone is headed to their respective
universities with excited hearts.]

169
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,800
We're here.

170
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:12,530
[Jae Suk arrives at Korea University.]

171
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:15,270
I've been here so many times in the past.

172
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:19,360
[Current time- 8:40 AM.
Korea University Campus.]

173
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,500
I actually used to be a part
of the cheerleading squad here.

174
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:26,280
I was a part of the cheerleading squad.
I wonder if anyone I know is still here.

175
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:29,960
I don't know
what kind of a person I should pick.

176
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,450
[Must be careful when choosing
their teammates.]

177
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:35,010
[But the campus is very quiet this morning
with many the students still on break.]

178
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:37,380
Kyung Hee University!

179
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:39,540
I think I should go this way.

180
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:43,990
How can the campus be so empty?

181
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:48,560
You didn't tell them I was coming, did you?

182
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:51,210
[That wouldn't have made a difference...]

183
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:54,890
There aren't any students on campus.

184
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:58,970
I haven't seen anyone around.
I can't believe how empty the campus is.

185
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:01,810
I feel like I'm back in college.

186
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:08,710
[This campus is
also devoid of any students...]

187
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:11,750
It's still too early in the morning.
But I don't have much time.

188
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:17,970
- Hello.
- Hello!

189
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,290
[Discovers some students!]

190
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:24,900
- We did a Tug-of-war race here before.
- I participated in that.

191
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:29,190
- I was a part of the team.
- So many students were out cheering for us.

192
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:33,280
- But it's so empty here today.
- We love you!

193
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:37,540
- I have to find someone to help me out.
- Me!

194
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:40,330
- Me!
- Pick me!

195
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:45,370
What major are you?
We have to build a boat today.

196
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:48,020
That's great.

197
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:49,950
We have to build a boat.

198
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:54,090
[A... boat?]

199
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:56,360
- I'm good at building boats.
- I can build it too.

200
00:10:56,850 --> 00:10:59,700
[Anything is cool with them!
This is what youthful passion is like!]

201
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,210
I don't know which one of you to pick.

202
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:05,230
I personally like someone
with long straight hair.

203
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:08,210
[They all have long straight hair!]

204
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,750
I didn't know there would be so many of you
with long straight hair!

205
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:14,360
[Who would've ever dreamt that
a day like this would come to him?]

206
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:18,720
All women's university.
I hope I can find some students.

207
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,270
What if I don't find any students on campus?

208
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:21,650
[And the happiest person of the day.]

209
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:23,710
All beautiful women are sleepyheads.

210
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:30,280
[Gary enters the library.]

211
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,810
I'm feeling a bit bashful now
that I'm here.

212
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:36,430
Hello.

213
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:40,130
Are you studying right now?

214
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:45,480
[A beautiful student studying
in the library.]

215
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:48,390
Is this university full of
beautiful women like yourself?

216
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:52,110
I actually...

217
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:57,100
[Getting up the courage to
tell her about his mission...]

218
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:59,060
I have a mission that I need to complete
with the help of university students.

219
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:04,530
And I have to choose two students who can
do the mission with me all day today.

220
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:06,750
- By any chance...
- Sure, I'd love to.

221
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:09,150
No, I'm not saying that you can
be on my team.

222
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,770
I have to choose my teammates.

223
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:15,850
But in order to do so,
I have to test them on a few things.

224
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:19,120
- Can you help me out with that? Thank you.
- Sure.

225
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,080
You look very beautiful this morning.

226
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:25,490
Then can you wait for me right here?
I'm going to go find a few more people.

227
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:29,910
- Is that okay with you?
- Yes.

228
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:32,330
I wish I could pick all of you.
I don't know what to do.

229
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:34,030
Do I have to pick just two people?

230
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:36,810
[Wishing that he could build a large ship
and put all the girls on the ship...]

231
00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:38,840
Why is your face suddenly so red?

232
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:41,670
[You know why...]

233
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:47,450
In this case... why don't
you all just come with me for now?

234
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:50,570
[Impossible to choose.
Taking everyone with him for now.]

235
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,750
I can't take all of them with me?

236
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:57,030
Or how about I just
stay out of the race today?

237
00:12:57,570 --> 00:12:59,630
Do I really have to participate today?

238
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:01,480
I just want to stay here.

239
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,750
- Hello.
- We heard that you were here.

240
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,920
[Other students heard of him being here,
and they all came out to see him.]

241
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:09,740
Wait a minute,
I'm feeling really bashful.

242
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:14,520
[Mr. Gary feels as though he woke up from
a nap in the field of flowers.]

243
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,600
[At the same time...]

244
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,640
[Jae Suk still hasn't run into
a single student on his campus.]

245
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:25,100
[He discovers a male student
leaving the library!]

246
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,200
Excuse me!

247
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:28,720
Excuse me!

248
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,420
Where are you going?

249
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:36,420
- Where are you headed right now?
- I was heading off to study.

250
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:39,600
Excuse me?
Wow, look at that calculator.

251
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,660
- What major are you?
- I'm studying Business Administration.

252
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:44,380
Really?
What year are you right now?

253
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:48,400
- I'm in my fourth year.
- You must be busy with your exams.

254
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:51,260
- Did you stay up all night last night?
- No, but I had some things going on.

255
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:54,450
- What kind of things?
- I got some bad news from my family.

256
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:57,750
- Bad news from your family?
- Yes, well...

257
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:59,780
- Is everything okay now?
- Yes, everything's fine now.

258
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:02,830
- What happened to your family?
- Our house got broken into last night.

259
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:04,660
[On my goodness...]

260
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:06,490
- I'm serious.
- So what happened?

261
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:08,470
- Everything turned out fine.
- Did you catch the thief?

262
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:11,070
No, we weren't able to catch him,
but we did report the robbery to the police.

263
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:12,740
I guess this won't do then.

264
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:15,040
How can I ask him to come build a boat
with me with his current situation?

265
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,200
No, it's okay.
I can come with you.

266
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,840
But your house was broken into last night.

267
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:24,340
- But your house was broken into.
- But it wasn't anything too serious.

268
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:28,650
That's a relief to hear.

269
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:30,880
It really is a relief to hear
that there wasn't too much damage.

270
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:34,380
It's good to do something uplifting
when something bad happens to you in life.

271
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:39,940
I can understand what you're saying,
but you can't think of this as being fun.

272
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:42,700
- This is going to be a warzone.
- You're going to build a boat?

273
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:45,180
- Yes, that's what I'm saying.
- A boat?

274
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:48,530
I think what happened to your house, and
your exhaustion is confusing you right now.

275
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:51,840
You must've not heard me right.

276
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,520
I'm not saying that you should come
on a boat ride with me on Han river.

277
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,860
- Build a boat?
- We have to build it. This is no joke.

278
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:58,120
I'm really good at building things.

279
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:00,940
- Really?
- I'm really athletic too.

280
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:04,000
- How are you athletic?
- I used to be a basketball player.

281
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,080
How long ago?

282
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,820
I know that I'm a bit short,
but I played all through middle school.

283
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:10,670
- I used to box too.
- Can you show me some boxing moves?

284
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:12,680
[Then how about showing us some
shadowboxing skills?]

285
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:15,040
Just a few moves.

286
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:22,620
[Huh?]

287
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,810
[Something is a bit...]

288
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:27,640
It's because you caught me off-guard.

289
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:31,100
- I caught you off-guard?
- Yes.

290
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:34,510
Seeing your boxing skills,
it doesn't look like you did that very long.

291
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:37,290
Not very long right?
How long did you box for?

292
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:39,770
- Two months.
- Two months?

293
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:45,280
Why are you doing this to me?
You're really overselling yourself right now.

294
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:48,210
[Just as he wanted, he found a male student
who seems to be similar to Kwang Soo.]

295
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:50,320
- Can I use one of these sheets?
- Yes, of course.

296
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:54,320
I know that this is pretty irrelevant,
but can you make me a paper boat?

297
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:56,450
- A paper boat?
- A paper boat.

298
00:15:56,450 --> 00:15:59,620
- I'm not sure if I remember how.
- You don't remember how?

299
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:01,540
Show me some of your skills.

300
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:07,330
Since you study accounting and things,
you're probably good with figures.

301
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:09,420
- I'm killer with all that.
- I bet it's no joke.

302
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,510
Can you just show me what
you can do?

303
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:15,890
- Okay, I'll give it a try.
- Yes, we have to try to win this.

304
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,960
This is still a flat sheet of paper.

305
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:31,140
[His unidentifiable skills?]

306
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:33,510
The paper is still the same.
You haven't folded anything at all.

307
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:38,360
- You're supposed to make a paper boat.
- The calculations for it have to be exact.

308
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,560
- Yes, the calculations have to be exact.
- We have to be exact about it.

309
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,640
The designing phase is crucial.

310
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:46,320
[Starting to use technical terms.]

311
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,030
90% of the success rate
is in the designing phase.

312
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:49,790
Yes, you're right.
That's exactly what I mean.

313
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:52,140
- You're saying you can design it?
- Yes.

314
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:53,400
- Seriously?
- Of course.

315
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,130
Even though I've never
actually done it before.

316
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:57,500
- Do you have some free time today?
- Yes, I've got some free time.

317
00:16:57,510 --> 00:17:02,140
If you and I become a team,
we need to recruit a female student too.

318
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:06,710
- I can go bring anyone you'd like.
- Do you have any friends you could bring?

319
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:09,420
- I do have a friend that I study with.
- Really?

320
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:13,570
What kind of a person is she?
Is she good at building things like this?

321
00:17:13,570 --> 00:17:16,190
No, I don't think so.
But even if it's not her...

322
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:23,980
This isn't a situation where I'm here to
introduce you to other girls.

323
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:29,330
I think that you're...
What is your nickname?

324
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:32,950
- 'Mi Young' back in middle school.
- Why were you called 'Mi Young'?

325
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:34,800
It stood for, 'Crazy Young Taek'.

326
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:42,110
[Resembling Kwang Soo more and more...]

327
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:43,890
That's not the way
that I want you to resemble Kwang Soo.

328
00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:47,920
Then can you come with me right now?

329
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:53,290
- Can you give me five minutes?
- Five minutes? Yes, that's fine.

330
00:17:53,290 --> 00:17:55,040
[Needs five minutes to get his things
from the library.]

331
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:59,020
I have decided to take Young Taek with me
for my male teammate.

332
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:02,860
Have you explained to him exactly
what he'll be doing with you today?

333
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:05,300
But from what I see,
Young Taek here...

334
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:07,080
- I can even build a house if I need to.
- Exactly my point.

335
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,970
[He's 'Taek-Guyver'.]

336
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:12,070
- Don't worry about him.
- Water.

337
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:13,930
- Han river.
- Don't worry.

338
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:16,940
I recently learned how to windsurf too.

339
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,890
[Okay, you win...]

340
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:21,880
If I told him that I want him to go to
outer space right now, he totally would.

341
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:24,010
Young Taek would fly up to the sky,
or dive to the ground if I asked him to.

342
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:26,860
He would do anything he's asked of right now
because he needs to do something uplifting.

343
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:29,050
What Young Taek needs right now
is to do something uplifting.

344
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:31,570
- You could fall into the Han river.
- That's okay.

345
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:34,130
- Why would you tell him that?
- As long as I have a life jacket on.

346
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:36,140
- Of course, we'd be giving that to you.
- Then I'm fine.

347
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:40,450
- What about extra underwear?
- Men can go without it from time to time.

348
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:43,080
That's the right frame of mind.
That's the right way to think about it.

349
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:46,070
This is the type of guy Young Taek is.
He'll just go along with the flow.

350
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:49,500
He'll go without underwear if need be.
Okay, Young Taek, come with me.

351
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,010
- Go get your stuff, Young Taek.
- Okay.

352
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:53,610
- I'll wait for you out here.
- Okay.

353
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,920
Okay, I've found a male student.

354
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:03,160
The thing I'm worried about right now is
that Young Taek is trying to meet a girl.

355
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:06,980
That's what kind of worries me,
but other than that, I really like him.

356
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:09,380
[Will Young Taek be able to find
the girl of his dreams on the show today?]

357
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:12,790
I've finally arrived at Dong-Guk University.

358
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:15,740
I think the best place for me to go
is the library.

359
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:19,720
I see a lot of students here.

360
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,900
But I want someone fit and strong.

361
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,460
You okay?

362
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:25,820
[Just then...]

363
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:28,240
- Don't I look like Kim Jong Kook?
- Wow!

364
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:31,410
You do look like him!
He looks just like Kim Jong Kook!

365
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:34,850
[Kim Jong Kook of Team Dong-Guk!]

366
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:38,520
Kim Jong Kook!

367
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:42,850
You and that temper too!

368
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:44,950
Dong-Guk University's Kim Jong Kook.

369
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:47,760
- What's your major?
- Korean language.

370
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,840
Korean language major?
Do you have any free time today?

371
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:51,640
- I'm working right now.
- What kind of work?

372
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,370
I'm fixing computers.

373
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:55,320
[How disappointing...
He's working right now.]

374
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,190
Yes, you do have to work.
Study and work.

375
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,600
You're working so hard.

376
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,700
Right now...
who's that couple over there?

377
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:02,870
Look at that couple.
Wow!

378
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:05,410
Wow, look at that couple.
Are you a couple?

379
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:07,450
- Are you two a couple?
- Yes, we're a couple.

380
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:10,220
Wow, look at you two.
Sorry, but have a good day.

381
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:12,120
Goodbye.

382
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:16,320
- Sorry, it ripped.
- You really are short.

383
00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:19,780
Wow, listen to him.
He's so sassy.

384
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:21,940
First... come here, let's sit down.

385
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:25,850
[What luck to be rolling in!
Sitting down together to talk.]

386
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:29,420
- I watch Running Man every week.
- How about a brief self-introduction first?

387
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:30,470
Introduce yourself.

388
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:33,480
My name is Kim Sun Eun,
and I'm a Business Administration Major.

389
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:36,140
- Classroom 13? Then how old are you?
- Yes, classroom 13.

390
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:39,920
- I'm 22 years old right now.
- 22 years old?

391
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:44,030
That's a good age.
Your turn to introduce yourself.

392
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:47,180
My name is Lee Ji Eun, and
I'm also a Business Administration Major.

393
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:51,070
- Then you guys are a 'CC' (Campus Couple)?
- Yes.

394
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:53,390
The most important thing is,
are you two free today?

395
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:54,950
- Just skip it.
- I think I can do that.

396
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,310
You could build memories together today.

397
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:59,670
[Memories of crossing the Han river
together as a couple?]

398
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:01,650
And he looks like he belongs on our team.

399
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:05,840
I need to do a simple physical test.
Okay?

400
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,640
- Do you see those elephant statues?
- Yes.

401
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:11,900
The one who comes back to the finish line
first after touching the nose wins.

402
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:13,830
- I'll be right back, okay?
- Okay. Fighting.

403
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:16,510
[Sweet as pie couple.]

404
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:17,520
Go!

405
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,440

406
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:22,690

407

[Sun Eun lost his shoe!]

408
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:30,390
[But he doesn't hesitate,
and just keeps on going!]

[Sun Eun wins with ease.]

410

[His ambition to win doesn't stop him
even as he loses his shoe.]

411
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:53,460
- I really like you.
- Okay.

412
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:55,340
I like the way you look too.

413
00:21:55,930 --> 00:21:59,400
I really think that you guys may be
a part of my team.

414
00:21:59,930 --> 00:22:04,640
Go to the cafeteria and grab some breakfast,
and I'll call you after I look around a bit.

415
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:07,470
I really hope that you guys
become members of my team.

416
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:12,430
We'll start from right here,
and whoever touch that first wins, okay?

417
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:13,740
[Another team, and another physical test.]

418
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:16,770
Ready.

419
00:22:18,610 --> 00:22:21,110

out of the blue.]

421

excited group of high school students.]

- Gary's at another university.

00:26:46,890 --> 00:26:48,670
- She's really light.
- One.

490
00:26:54,590 --> 00:26:57,580
[This student looks like he can do
about a hundred of this exercise.]

491
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:59,120
I really like doing this.

492
00:26:59,530 --> 00:27:02,030
[And Yoo Jae Suk on the other hand...]

493
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:04,420
It's been quite a while since
Young Taek went in there.

494
00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:09,560
[No sight of Young Taek,
who went in to get his backpack...]

495
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,370
I don't know about him.

496
00:27:12,770 --> 00:27:15,020
I wonder if Young Taek...
There's Young Taek right now!

497
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:17,200
[Young Taek finally steps out.]

498
00:27:19,130 --> 00:27:20,940
You said you only needed five minutes,
but you took longer than that.

499
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:23,340
It's okay.
What took you so long?

500
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:25,520
- I had a lot of books to gather up.
- You had a lot of things?

501
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:28,640
Okay, let's go.
By any chance, are any of them your friends?

502
00:27:29,290 --> 00:27:31,750
- I know a lot of their faces.
- Really?

503
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:34,120
By any chance, do you know Young Taek?
Are you a friend of his?

504
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:37,880
- Young Taek!
- Can you tell me what Young Taek is like?

505
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:40,040
No, there's no need to be shy.

506
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:42,990
What kind of a guy is Young Taek?

507
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:46,830
- Is Young Taek pretty fit? Really?
- Yes.

508
00:27:47,730 --> 00:27:50,030
- He says he boxes too.
- Yes, he's a good boxer.

509
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:53,910
[What? He's a good boxer?]

510
00:27:54,970 --> 00:27:56,920
I saw his boxing skills.

511
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:59,060
- He's a good boxer? Seriously?
- Yes, he's good.

512
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:00,920
Thank you for taking
the time out to talk to me.

513
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:03,740
Young Taek is on my team,
and if my team wins first place

514
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:06,040
Young Taek will take you guys all out
to celebrate.

515
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:08,290
Yes, give Young Taek a round of applause.

516
00:28:08,290 --> 00:28:13,250
[Off on his way with a crowd of his
fellow students cheering him on.]

517
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:17,520
He'll be back.
Don't worry about Young Taek.

518
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,490
He'll come back a winner.

519
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:23,970
I promise that Young Taek will come
back a winner. You all just wait and see.

520
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:26,830
Have a good day.
Thank you!

521
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:29,040
You saw that, right?

522
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:35,230
All those people back there now have
huge expectations of you.

523
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:37,010
You have to come back a winner.

524
00:28:37,010 --> 00:28:39,800
- You have to come back as a winner.
- I vow to come in at first place.

525
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:43,710
- Wait, we still need a girl student.
- A girl student...

526
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:48,530
What do you think is the most important
quality we need to look for in a girl student?

527
00:28:48,530 --> 00:28:50,110
Long black hair?

528
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:53,120
What are you talking about?

529
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,680
Come here.

530
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:59,930
What does her hair have to do
with anything?

531
00:29:00,970 --> 00:29:04,960
[It seems as though Young Taek has a
different kind of mission in his mind.]

532
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,520
Seriously.

533
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:07,820
- Young Taek.
- Yes?

534
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:12,820
Okay... I'll accept that.

535
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:15,670
Long black hair?
Okay, long black hair.

536
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:20,900
- Okay, what else other than the hair?
- I think she should be about 163-164cm tall.

537
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:24,430
[Unbelievable...]

538
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:27,780
- Why?
- If she's to fit my height...

539
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,800
Why does she have to fit
your height?

540
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:33,520
- Why does her height have to fit yours?
- Our team...

541
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,390
- Because we're a team?
- Yes.

542
00:29:35,390 --> 00:29:37,690
- What else?
- Other than that...

543
00:29:37,690 --> 00:29:41,110
- You're okay with everything else?
- Yes, I'm okay.

544
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:47,200
Don't you think that it would be good to find
someone who's a bit brash and forward?

545
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,810
- Yes, I agree with that.
- Right? Someone a bit competitive?

546
00:29:49,810 --> 00:29:51,380
- Yes.
- Somewhat, right?

547
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:56,840
- Have you ever rowed oars before?
- Yes, I have.

548
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:58,920
I know how to windsurf.

549
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,780
He says he's done it before.

550
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:02,540
Young Taek has done it all.

551
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:04,350
[Young Taek has experience in every skill!]

552
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:10,620
- This past summer... you know those canoes?
- Yes, canoes.

553
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:14,150
I rowed a banana boat across Han river.

554
00:30:14,150 --> 00:30:16,560
[Rowed a banana boat?]

555
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:21,070
Don't ask him so many questions.
Don't try to examine him like that.

556
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:23,760
Didn't you just hear him say that he rowed
a banana boat across the river?

557
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:26,740
It's okay, Young Taek.
Let's just go. I have faith in you.

558
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:33,220
[Discovers two female students
waving at them enthusiastically.]

559
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:35,350
- Are you students at this school?
- No.

560
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:37,430
Then did you just come here for a visit?

561
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:41,710
- We're from Kyung Hee University.
- That's where Ji Suk Jin is.

562
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:43,420
We just saw him.

563
00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:46,520
He told us that you were here,
so we took a bus over here to see you.

564
00:30:48,210 --> 00:30:50,490
- Where's Yoo Jae Suk?
- Yoo Jae Suk's at Korea University.

565
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:54,760
[It's these two students!]

566
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:59,600
[They raced over here to see Jae Suk!]

567
00:30:59,610 --> 00:31:03,790
- What's Ji Suk Jin doing?
- He keeps cheering himself on.

568
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,980
- That's what he's doing over there?
- Yes.

569
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:10,830
[That's what he's still doing...]

570
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:18,460
[At the same time, Ha Ha is...]

571
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:26,810
[He hears someone singing
inside the room!]

572
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:37,360
[He opens the door to see a female student
playing the piano as she sings along.]

573
00:31:39,490 --> 00:31:42,480
[Could this be fate?]

574
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:53,080
[Haroro is mesmerized by her singing.]

575
00:31:59,030 --> 00:32:01,660
I can't believe that just happened.
It was like something out of a drama.

576
00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:06,540
It's nice to meet you.
I'm here from Running Man.

577
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:10,180
Yes, I'm here from Running Man.
What are you practicing right now?

578
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:12,600
- I'm practicing my singing.
- Singing practice?

579
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,960
- Are you a music major?
- Yes.

580
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:18,850
Can you play some more?
I loved hearing you sing.

581
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:25,940
['A Farewell For Me' by Kim Hye Rim.]

582
00:32:55,730 --> 00:33:00,210
[Sun Min's clear and singing voice...]

583
00:33:02,410 --> 00:33:04,610
May I join you in this song?

584
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:15,990
[What an awful duet...]

585
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:53,710
- Are you here for a class?
- No, I'm here to practice on my own.

586
00:33:53,710 --> 00:33:58,210
[Park Sun Min, who came to school early in
the morning to get some lone practice time.]

587
00:33:58,210 --> 00:34:02,740
Why don't you come with me over there?
Then do you have some free time today?

588
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:03,940
Are you free?

589
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:06,670
- Yes.
- You're just here to practice, right?

590
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:10,150
- Yes.
- I purely came in here by coincidence.

591
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:14,430
This really is something that would
only happen in a drama or a movie.

592
00:34:14,430 --> 00:34:16,340
I can't even believe
that this is happening right now.

593
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:18,810
I feel that this is fate.

594
00:34:18,810 --> 00:34:20,930
I don't even know who you are.

595
00:34:21,050 --> 00:34:24,340
But I just loved the way you looked from
behind when I walked in this room.

596
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:26,610
There's a huge competition
that's about to take place.

597
00:34:26,610 --> 00:34:28,590
If we win that race...

598
00:34:28,590 --> 00:34:32,520
then we can show the whole country that
this truly is the best university around.

599
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:35,650
Do you have the confidence to go out there
and give it the best you've got today?

600
00:34:35,650 --> 00:34:37,760
- Yes.
- Fighting!

601
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:38,920
[He recruits a musical girl.]

602
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:43,200
In that case, let's get you changed into
my team uniform and come along with me.

603
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:47,410
Who was that guy from earlier?
The guy from that couple from earlier?

604
00:34:47,410 --> 00:34:49,490
[He completes his team by recruiting
ambitious Sun Eun from earlier.]

605
00:34:49,490 --> 00:34:51,870
Even though skills are important too...

606
00:34:51,870 --> 00:34:56,220
the soul that screams passion
from your heart...

607
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:57,540
that's what I'm going to be looking for.

608
00:34:57,540 --> 00:35:00,560
- Do you want me to pose in any specific way?
- How about a sexy pose?

609
00:35:04,370 --> 00:35:08,980
[I wish that I could stop time.]

610
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:10,570
You've got ten minutes.

611
00:35:10,570 --> 00:35:14,910
[Ten minutes-
Must draw a portrait of Gary.]

612
00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:17,150
Think of yourself as being in France.

613
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:19,200
Think of me as some French model.

614
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:30,720
[The very first student that he met
this morning to show her work first.]

615
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:34,710
The peaceful expression on your face,
the thick, masculine eyebrows

616
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:36,630
and the high prominent nose...

617
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:42,660
Thank you.

618
00:35:43,390 --> 00:35:45,900
I drew you as you are while part
of the Monday Couple.

619
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:48,760
[Next student drew Kang Gary in his
Monday Couple phase.]

620
00:35:48,770 --> 00:35:53,310
- I drew a very calm picture of you.
- That's a picture of a monkey.

621
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:56,750
[ET Gary?]

622
00:35:56,750 --> 00:36:00,740
I wrote the phrase, 'I want Kang Gary',
and I drew a small figure of Ji Hyo too.

623
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:03,120
- I drew you as a flower boy.
- Are we a Tuesday Couple now?

624
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:09,910
- You drew me like a nice cartoon character.
- Your eyes are shooting hearts.

625
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:18,080
How about reciting a poem with my name?
'Kang'.

626
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:21,440
- Kang Gary.
- Yes?

627
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:25,500
- Sorry. 'Gae'
- I can't help but to keep looking at you.

628
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:27,570
Is that how my name is spelled?

629
00:36:27,570 --> 00:36:29,710
Well, 'Ga' and 'Gae' is pretty much
the same.

630
00:36:30,170 --> 00:36:32,380
- I can't help but to keep looking at you.
- Me too.

631
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:35,310
- 'Ri'.
- Come here.

632
00:36:35,310 --> 00:36:37,450
Come where?

633
00:36:37,450 --> 00:36:39,780
[A very unique way of reciting
the poem.]

634
00:36:42,490 --> 00:36:44,530
- 'Kang'.
- In Kang-nam...

635
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:48,270
- 'Gae'
- If I was to see Gary...

636
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:53,010
These ladies are really
making my heart flutter.

637
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:55,570
- 'Ri'.
- I'm going to tie him up and take him home.

638
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:05,570
You were all so good, and
I feel like I've gotten close to all of you.

639
00:37:05,570 --> 00:37:08,590
It's so hard to pick just one of you.

640
00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:13,160
But the student who wanted to
tie me up in a ribbon...

641
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:18,400
[Makeup artist major, Lee Ye Na is chosen!]

642
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:23,440
Can you put your phone on vibrate?
This is a very important moment right now.

643
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:30,620
[Jae Suk and Young Taek are busy trying to
recruit a female student of their own.]

644
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:32,480
His name is Young Taek.

645
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:36,090
- He's a business major.
- I see. Hello.

646
00:37:36,090 --> 00:37:38,550
Did you hear her say, 'I see'?
It means she's not interested in you.

647
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:43,700
I'm really sorry to be asking this...

648
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:49,180
but do you have any free time?
Not all day, but until about 6 PM?

649
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:52,920
- Until 6 PM? I have a meeting later.
- What kind of a meeting?

650
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:55,930
I have to go and help some students
who are in need.

651
00:37:55,930 --> 00:37:57,940
Then that's not going to work.
You have to go help take care of them.

652
00:37:57,940 --> 00:38:01,070
- In that case... maybe next time?
- See you next time?

653
00:38:03,470 --> 00:38:05,310
Okay, I'll see you next time.

654
00:38:05,310 --> 00:38:08,080
You're really cool.

655
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:15,170
That's too bad that you two have
other things going on and have to get going.

656
00:38:15,650 --> 00:38:16,770
By any chance...

657
00:38:17,470 --> 00:38:21,970
Can you think about it some more?
Maybe we can ask you about it again later?

658
00:38:21,970 --> 00:38:24,480
- Yes, thank you.
- Bye.

659
00:38:26,870 --> 00:38:29,440
That's too bad.
She doesn't have the time.

660
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,170
- How do you feel about that, Young Taek?
- How do you feel?

661
00:38:31,170 --> 00:38:35,800
I think that they both...
will be very good at building boats.

662
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:40,770
[Young Taek is hiding his true feelings behind
the veil of their potential building skills?]

663
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:44,920
Well...
listening to the way she was speaking...

664
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:48,530
I saw you.
I saw the way you were looking at them.

665
00:38:48,530 --> 00:38:52,340
[The way Young Taek was looking at them
was totally caught by Jae Suk.]

666
00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:57,180
- But they don't have the time for it.
- And being a psychology major...

667
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:02,050
- What about being a psychology major?
- I think they'd be really good at it.

668
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,900
You think they'd be good workers
because they're psychology majors?

669
00:39:09,170 --> 00:39:11,970
[It's almost time for them to head out...]

670
00:39:12,030 --> 00:39:15,420
I think the girl in the white pants
looks pretty competitive.

671
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:18,570
What are you doing?

672
00:39:18,570 --> 00:39:21,950
- I think that she'd be very good at it.
- He keeps pointing out his ideal type to me.

673
00:39:21,950 --> 00:39:23,160
[He's outright telling Jae Suk
about his ideal type now.]

674
00:39:24,950 --> 00:39:28,100
[Just then, a female student
boldly raises her hand.]

675
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:31,270
You're a student here?
What is your major?

676
00:39:31,270 --> 00:39:33,300
- Psychology major.
- Psychology major?

677
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:35,280
[She's also a psychology major.]

678
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,940
Are you a friend of hers?

679
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:40,400
Are you good at building things?

680
00:39:40,850 --> 00:39:42,920
- I'm actually pretty strong.
- Really?

681
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:45,300
- You're strong?
- Yes.

682
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:48,670
- You want me to grip it harder?
- Wow.

683
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:52,570
- You're strong.
- I like how bold and forward she is.

684
00:39:55,130 --> 00:39:58,320
[Now that we think about it, it seems
Young Taek likes psychology majors.]

685
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,070
- Young Taek.
- Yes?

686
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:02,900
What kind of sports are you good at?

687
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:06,730
- I know how to do shooting, but others...
- You know how to shoot?

688
00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:11,380
[Young Taek and this student alike...
They're not very meek students...]

689
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:14,220
- Do you have some free time today?
- Yes, I can take the day off.

690
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:17,520
- You can take the day off? Seriously?
- Yes.

691
00:40:18,210 --> 00:40:20,280
She's very forward.

692
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:24,460
She's really... she's really forward.

693
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:29,320
[Young Taek and Bo Yoon make up
Team Korea.]

694
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:32,730
Bo Yoon, come right back, okay?

695
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:41,260
Then Young Taek and I will go as a team and
we promise to return as victors of the race.

696
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:43,160
Thank you.

697
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:48,530
<i>Yoo Jae Suk!</i>

698
00:40:48,530 --> 00:40:52,330
Thank you for all your cheer
and encouragement!

699
00:40:52,330 --> 00:40:55,330
[Team Korea is now off to the competition!]

700
00:40:56,890 --> 00:40:58,410
Cham, cham, cham!

701
00:41:00,590 --> 00:41:04,450
[Gary completes picking out
teammates as well.]

702
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:14,200
[Kkuk is also in the phase of
picking out his final teammates.]

703
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:15,850
- 'Jong'.
- Kim Jong Kook is really...

704
00:41:16,410 --> 00:41:19,000
- 'Kook'.
- The handsomest man in this country.

705
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:25,510
- Chung-Ang University!
- Fighting!

706
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:27,530
[All seven university teams are now complete!]

707
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:35,180
Let's go and show them
what your university is made of!

708
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:37,320
- Go!
- Okay, let's go.

709
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:39,240
[Park Sun Min- 25. Theater major.
Kim Sun Eun- 22. Business Admin major.]

710
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:43,440
Is there anyone whom you've always wanted
to meet from the cast of Running Man?

711
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:46,890
You know you can imagine whom you'd
want to be teamed up with in a game?

712
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:49,710
Who would you pick?

713
00:41:49,710 --> 00:41:51,950
- Ji Hyo.
- I'd pick Gary.

714
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:59,700
[He's asking the same question.]

715
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:01,830
I like Jae Suk.

716
00:42:02,230 --> 00:42:04,390
- What about you, Yoo Kyung?
- I like Gary.

717
00:42:04,390 --> 00:42:06,750
Do you both want to get out of the car?

718
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:13,160
- How do you expect to win like this?
- Lee Kwang Soo!

719
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:15,340
- I'm sure we'll win somehow.
- Yes.

720
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:19,620
- Should we come up with a battle cry?
- A battle cry?

721
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:21,450
[That's our forward Young Taek.]

722
00:42:21,450 --> 00:42:23,900
Why are you thinking
of a battle cry already?

723
00:42:24,870 --> 00:42:26,920
- Are you a third year student, Bo Yoon?
- Yes.

724
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:29,250
- And Young Taek is a fourth year student?
- Yes.

725
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:31,680
- I have one semester left.
- You only have one semester left?

726
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:34,900
I'm so grateful that you're allowing me to
finish out my last year like this.

727
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:38,600
What are you talking about?
We have to win before you can say that.

728
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:41,390
[You have to cross the river
without sinking first...]

729
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:45,760
- I think I'll be happy no matter what.
- It's good to think so positively like that.

730
00:42:45,770 --> 00:42:48,650
- You're prepared too, Bo Yoon?
- Yes.

731
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:51,830
[Start of 2014
Han River University Competition.]

732
00:42:57,430 --> 00:42:58,860
What is this?

733
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:01,880
What the heck is this?

734
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:04,000
[Team Korea is the first team to arrive.]

735
00:43:04,010 --> 00:43:05,580
I thought we were building a boat.

736
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:10,300
[Why are there balloons, hoola hoops,
and chips on this field?]

737
00:43:10,310 --> 00:43:13,090
- These are my two students.
- Okay.

738
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:14,300
[Team Chung-Ang also arrives.]

739
00:43:15,110 --> 00:43:17,500
- You're very bright.
- Yes, she's a very bright person.

740
00:43:17,510 --> 00:43:21,350
She's much brighter than I expected.
I didn't think she'd make it here with me.

741
00:43:21,350 --> 00:43:25,070
These two are my teammates.
They're both very positive people.

742
00:43:25,850 --> 00:43:28,710
- You told them about how we fell in, right?
- Yes, I told them.

743
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:32,470
He called his mother and she told him that
she had a weird dream last night.

744
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:36,000
- She said she dreamed about water.
- And he's going to be on a boat today.

745
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,800
- Yes, her dream was right.
- Song Ji Hyo.

746
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:43,310
- Look at her two male teammates.
- I have the perfect team for boat building.

747
00:43:44,590 --> 00:43:48,300
[The best of the best teammates are
all arriving one by one.]

748
00:43:49,170 --> 00:43:50,790
- Kwang Soo.
- Yes, Jae Suk.

749
00:43:50,790 --> 00:43:53,030
You brought two very adorable
people with you.

750
00:43:53,750 --> 00:43:55,520
[Tiny]

751
00:43:56,620 --> 00:43:59,670
- What is your major?
- I'm an economics major.

752
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:03,030
- And what about you?
- He just got accepted.

753
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:07,540
[Does this mean that he's still
a high school student?]

754
00:44:07,540 --> 00:44:11,860
- No, he's 20 years old.
- He's about to start his first year?

755
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:15,590
- That means he's still a high school student.
- There wasn't anyone else to choose from.

756
00:44:15,590 --> 00:44:20,630
- But he's still a high school student.
- No, I just graduated today.

757
00:44:20,630 --> 00:44:22,250
You just graduated today?

758
00:44:22,250 --> 00:44:24,900
[Crossing the Han river is his
graduation gift?]

759
00:44:26,390 --> 00:44:29,510
Everyone's here now.
Why are you holding their hands?

760
00:44:29,510 --> 00:44:33,420
- Why are you holding their hands?
- We're building our teamwork.

761
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:36,990
- Why are you holding their hands?
- We're trying to build teamwork.

762
00:44:36,990 --> 00:44:39,630
I heard that he held an audition for them.

763
00:44:39,630 --> 00:44:42,980
- You held an audition?
- It was my version of Kpop Star.

764
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:47,980
Kang Gary.
This is my teammate, Sang Bum.

765
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:50,950
- Sang Bum's nickname is, Kang Gary.
- Why?

766
00:44:50,950 --> 00:44:53,980
- He says he gets compared to you a lot.
- Is that why you chose him?

767
00:44:55,030 --> 00:44:57,090
[Is that why?]

768
00:44:57,090 --> 00:44:59,130
- He wants to stand next to you and see.
- Song Ji Hyo's mine.

769
00:44:59,130 --> 00:45:01,420
Song Ji Hyo's mine.

770
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:09,950
[You better stay on your toes
today, Gary.]

771
00:45:10,820 --> 00:45:12,290
Do you know how I met her today?

772
00:45:12,290 --> 00:45:15,450
I was about to give up when I heard
someone playing the piano in one of the rooms.

773
00:45:15,450 --> 00:45:19,450
[Sound of the piano that he heard
playing in a room...]

774
00:45:19,450 --> 00:45:21,980
She was playing the farewell song
all by herself early this morning.

775
00:45:21,980 --> 00:45:24,190
- Why?
- She was singing while playing the piano.

776
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:27,350
I'm sure it's because she had
something happen to her.

777
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:29,530
- Look here!
- That's why she was playing that song.

778
00:45:29,540 --> 00:45:34,020
You say something happened to her?
His house was broken into last night.

779
00:45:35,660 --> 00:45:39,340
[A breakup is nothing compared to me...]

780
00:45:39,340 --> 00:45:44,560
He still came on the show today even after
what happened to lift his spirits up.

781
00:45:46,070 --> 00:45:49,370
[All of the strongest students are
together all in one place today!]

782
00:45:49,370 --> 00:45:52,200
We were all so happy to meet each other.

783
00:45:54,690 --> 00:45:57,770
- Okay, we now have everyone here.
- Ji Suk Jin's not here yet.

784
00:45:58,820 --> 00:46:01,500
[Why are you disregarding Big-nosed Brother?]

785
00:46:02,580 --> 00:46:05,760
- Ji Suk Jin's not here yet.
- He's here.

786
00:46:05,770 --> 00:46:07,240
There he is.

787
00:46:08,260 --> 00:46:10,910
[Team Kyung Hee finally arrives as if
they knew others were talking about them.]

788
00:46:10,910 --> 00:46:12,940
Let's all welcome them
with a round of applause.

789
00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:16,330
Ji Suk Jin!
Ji Suk Jin!

790
00:46:16,330 --> 00:46:19,150
[A pity welcome party?]

791
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:23,780
The rumor's spread to even Korea University.
I heard you've been cheering yourself on?

792
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:25,350
- Seriously?
- That's right.

793
00:46:25,350 --> 00:46:26,720
Can you all introduce yourselves?

794
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:31,290
Hello, my name is Hong Sung Yong,
and I'm a philosophy major.

795
00:46:31,290 --> 00:46:34,020
- Nice to meet you.
- What a great personality.

796
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:38,820
She belongs to a group at school,
and they're called, 'The Employment Group'.

797
00:46:39,510 --> 00:46:42,870
[We hope that you find a job soon!]

798
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:47,400
Hello, my name is Yoon Ye Ji, and
I recently graduated with a business degree.

799
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:51,950
[That completes all seven teams!]

800
00:46:51,950 --> 00:46:57,170
Welcome to all the students who are here to
participate in Running University Challenge.

801
00:46:57,720 --> 00:47:00,250
[Welcome]

802
00:47:00,250 --> 00:47:02,060
- You all know what you're doing today?
- Yes.

803
00:47:02,060 --> 00:47:03,970
Did you tell them
they could fall in the water?

804
00:47:03,970 --> 00:47:05,610
- Yes, of course.
- Did they say that it was okay?

805
00:47:05,610 --> 00:47:08,360
He said he wouldn't even care if
the bungee cord snapped on him.

806
00:47:09,310 --> 00:47:13,180
Running Man members have experienced
crossing the Han river before.

807
00:47:14,630 --> 00:47:16,860
Then you're all aware how important it is
to build a good boat

808
00:47:16,860 --> 00:47:19,690
and how important the material you
build that boat with is, correct?

809
00:47:19,690 --> 00:47:22,310
- Yes.
- You're not building your boat with paper.

810
00:47:22,310 --> 00:47:25,730
- Then what are we building it with?
- We have seven other material here for you.

811
00:47:26,850 --> 00:47:31,980
We will first play a round of games to
determine which material each team will win.

812
00:47:33,820 --> 00:47:41,110
Do you all see the field behind you?
It's a three person relay game.

813
00:47:41,710 --> 00:47:44,730
[Game to determine which boat building
material you win.]

814
00:47:44,730 --> 00:47:49,320
<i>First course- Pop the balloon with your butt
before you can move onto second course.</i>

815
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:55,310
<i>In the second course, all three of you must
go through the same hoola hoop as one.</i>

816
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:58,430
<i>For the third course, you have to eat
a ring of cookie together.</i>

817
00:47:58,430 --> 00:48:01,610
<i>Then you all have to cross
the finish line together.</i>

818
00:48:01,610 --> 00:48:03,280
- Are you all ready?
- Yes.

819
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:05,900
[Everyone's lined up against the fence.]

820
00:48:07,190 --> 00:48:09,500
- We'll just naturally win this, okay?
- Yes.

821
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:12,620
Wrap your arm around my waist.
Yes, there you go.

822
00:48:12,620 --> 00:48:15,010
[Everyone's coming up with
plans of their own.]

823
00:48:15,010 --> 00:48:17,950
- Ready.
- Let's do this.

824
00:48:19,570 --> 00:48:22,160
[Teamwork is the most important
element in this game.]

825
00:48:23,460 --> 00:48:27,050
[This one game will determine which material
will be given to them to build their boats.]

826
00:48:31,330 --> 00:48:34,010
<i>One, two...</i>

827
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:38,010
[First course- Pop the balloon.]

828
00:48:39,770 --> 00:48:41,910
What are you guys doing!

829
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:45,900
[Team Dong-kuk is the first to arrive.]

830
00:48:48,110 --> 00:48:50,820
[Most people are breezing through
the first course with ease.]

831
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:54,510
[Quickly heads onto the second course-
Hoola hoop.]

832
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:58,040
[In last place...]

833
00:48:58,550 --> 00:49:01,630
[Pops the balloon with her whole body!]

834
00:49:01,630 --> 00:49:04,310
- You have to pop it with your butt.
- Your butt! Use your butt!

835
00:49:04,310 --> 00:49:06,790
You did it!
Get up!

836
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:08,970
[It's tough being with Kwang Soo, isn't it?]

837
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:13,960
[Second course- Hoola hoops.]

838
00:49:15,950 --> 00:49:19,040
[Team Dong-kuk and
Team Kyung Hee are in the lead.]

839
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:21,400
[Easily passes the hoola hoop from the top.]

840
00:49:23,180 --> 00:49:25,950
[This team passes the hoop from the bottom.]

841
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:29,940
[Easily succeeds the second course.]

842
00:49:30,890 --> 00:49:32,280
[Still in the last place...]

843
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:35,970
Right foot on two!
Just leave it!

844
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:39,470
[Non-stop screaming Giraffe.]

845
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:41,560
- Lift it up!
- We're ruined.

846
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:46,370
[Third course- Eat the cracker.]

847
00:49:54,330 --> 00:50:00,250
[Come on, cracker... where are you going?]

848
00:50:00,990 --> 00:50:03,110
[These crackers are placed up pretty high.]

849
00:50:05,230 --> 00:50:07,560
[High level of concentration.]

850
00:50:09,370 --> 00:50:12,240
[Big-nosed Brother succeeds in
eating his cracker!]

851
00:50:15,570 --> 00:50:17,990
[First place- Team Kyung Hee.]

852
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,210
[Second place- Team Dong-kuk.]

853
00:50:22,290 --> 00:50:25,240
[Breaking out in celebration of joy.]

854
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:29,270
[Aren't you going to eat your crackers?]

855
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:39,520
[Team Korea comes in at third place.]

856
00:50:40,540 --> 00:50:42,880
[These three are in a league of their own...]

857
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:47,490
[Not easy for this team with
the cracker placed up so high.]

858
00:50:49,420 --> 00:50:51,870
[Just then, these guys in the last place
comes in to participate in the last course.]

859
00:50:54,060 --> 00:50:56,430
[That's our Giraffe.]

860
00:50:57,900 --> 00:51:00,080
[Gets that cracker in his first attempt.]

861
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:03,070
[Succeeds in catching up to the others
and comes in at fifth place.]

862
00:51:04,570 --> 00:51:07,160
[Gary is exhausted from having
lifted up one of the students.]

863
00:51:13,100 --> 00:51:15,750
[Team Kun-Kuk succeeds the mission.]

864
00:51:18,030 --> 00:51:20,310
What do we do?
We're in last place.

865
00:51:23,740 --> 00:51:25,670
Hey!
What is this!

866
00:51:25,670 --> 00:51:27,430
What's wrong with you girls!

867
00:51:27,430 --> 00:51:29,240
[Enraged at coming in at last place.]

868
00:51:30,970 --> 00:51:35,680
[Off to pick the materials first.]

869
00:51:39,050 --> 00:51:41,700
[Off to the next location
in the order of their win.]

870
00:51:42,490 --> 00:51:45,570
[This is the boat building grounds.]

871
00:51:45,570 --> 00:51:47,390
Don't come in yet, and stand in a line.

872
00:51:47,390 --> 00:51:50,480
[Plastic bottles, balls, and even blankets?]

873
00:51:51,030 --> 00:51:54,220
Those blankets.
Gary, I think you're going to get those.

874
00:51:54,220 --> 00:51:57,020
[Even from a brief glance,
they're predicting that Gary will get it?]

875
00:51:57,480 --> 00:52:02,170
For the students that come in at first place,
they will win financial scholarships.

876
00:52:02,390 --> 00:52:04,820
[Immediately feels their ambitions rising.]

877
00:52:05,940 --> 00:52:10,730
We will start by having Suk Jin's team
choose their materials.

878
00:52:10,740 --> 00:52:12,890
Choose your material
and go stand in front of it.

879
00:52:15,100 --> 00:52:18,610
[Goes to stand in front of the water bottles
without any hesitation.]

880
00:52:20,090 --> 00:52:22,540
We're going to go with the water basin.

881
00:52:22,980 --> 00:52:25,040
[Second place-
Team Dong-kuk chooses the water basin.]

882
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:27,160
- We want the cans.
- Okay, go stand in front of the cans.

883
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:29,200
[Team Korea chooses the cans.]

884
00:52:31,060 --> 00:52:33,620
- We're going with the balls.
- The balls.

885
00:52:33,620 --> 00:52:35,900
[Team Chung-Ang chooses the balls.]

886
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:38,790
- Balloons!
- Balloons!

887
00:52:38,790 --> 00:52:40,900
[Team Seo-Gang chooses the balloons.]

888
00:52:42,420 --> 00:52:46,310
[The only thing left are blankets
and plastic bags...]

889
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:49,690
- We want the blankets.
- Okay, blankets.

890
00:52:49,690 --> 00:52:52,080
In that case, you have the plastic bags.

891
00:52:53,370 --> 00:52:55,460
It's the plastic bags life.

892
00:52:55,460 --> 00:52:58,640
Don't worry.
We can still make it float.

893
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:05,730
[Material selection process complete.]

894
00:53:06,660 --> 00:53:09,390
[Time to build the boats!]

895
00:53:09,390 --> 00:53:12,800
This is going to be right.
You have to go with your gut instinct.

896
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:18,060
We first build the boat,
and do you see those large bottles back there?

897
00:53:18,060 --> 00:53:21,180
- We'll attach the big ones like this.
- On both sides?

898
00:53:21,180 --> 00:53:23,170
I'm positive that this won't sink.

899
00:53:23,170 --> 00:53:26,340
We have to come in at first place
because we have the best material.

900
00:53:26,340 --> 00:53:29,100
We have to admit
that we have the best material.

901
00:53:29,100 --> 00:53:31,910
- We can't sink with this material.
- We can't lose with this material.

902
00:53:31,910 --> 00:53:35,220
If we lose with this...
no, that can't happen!

903
00:53:35,220 --> 00:53:37,720
I really want to help you guys
win the scholarships, okay?

904
00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:39,100
[Big-nose wants to get them
their scholarships.]

905
00:53:39,100 --> 00:53:41,250
Maybe we should tie them up like this.

906
00:53:42,100 --> 00:53:43,560
- What are you doing?
- I'm sorry.

907
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:46,310
- I didn't do that on purpose.
- Seriously.

908
00:53:46,310 --> 00:53:49,380
She's so demur when she gets angry.
'Oh my goodness'.

909
00:53:53,900 --> 00:53:56,920
[Serious about bottle boat building.]

910
00:53:56,920 --> 00:53:58,950
There's nothing we can say if we lose
with this material.

911
00:53:59,220 --> 00:54:00,730
We really can't say anything then.

912
00:54:01,380 --> 00:54:04,100
[Meanwhile...]

913
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:06,540
I'm sorry.

914
00:54:07,710 --> 00:54:09,420
Why did it pop?

915
00:54:12,360 --> 00:54:13,940
I'm sorry.

916
00:54:14,580 --> 00:54:17,040
[The balloons are popping left and right.]

917
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:21,270
[Pops... and pops again.]

918
00:54:25,550 --> 00:54:28,240
- Putting tape on it is making it pop.
- Right?

919
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:30,380
[Not easy to tape the balloons together.]

920
00:54:30,380 --> 00:54:32,090
They're all going to pop.

921
00:54:32,090 --> 00:54:35,710
Please stop popping them!
Be more careful!

922
00:54:35,740 --> 00:54:37,640
[Taking his anger out on Chun Yi.]

923
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:39,130
How do we stop it from popping?

924
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:42,430
What are we going to do?
We're ruined!

925
00:54:42,430 --> 00:54:44,780
[Their hopes are popping
along with the balloons.]

926
00:54:44,780 --> 00:54:46,630
We're ruined!

927
00:54:46,630 --> 00:54:48,750
We're going to fall into the Han river!

928
00:54:48,750 --> 00:54:51,360
- Let's just swim across.
- You want to swim across?

929
00:54:56,040 --> 00:54:59,660
- Are those sandbags on the sides?
- No, it's air in the plastic bags.

930
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:04,990
- Is that the large plastic bags?
- Yes, and there's air inside of that too.

931
00:55:04,990 --> 00:55:07,760
- All with plastic bags?
- With air inside.

932
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:12,820
- So the most important thing for us is...
- Getting air in the plastic bags.

933
00:55:12,820 --> 00:55:15,230
[Getting air in the plastic bags
is the key to their success.]

934
00:55:22,050 --> 00:55:26,240
Even though we chose a difficult road...
we overcame our obstacle.

935
00:55:27,780 --> 00:55:30,960
- Are these not popping?
- I don't know, so don't touch them.

936
00:55:33,770 --> 00:55:36,140
- Are these okay?
- I told you not to touch them!

937
00:55:36,140 --> 00:55:37,460
[Giraffe is pressing all the air
out of the plastic bags.]

938
00:55:37,460 --> 00:55:39,970
I told you not to do that!

939
00:55:39,970 --> 00:55:42,980
- The air is leaking!
- That's none of your business!

940
00:55:44,420 --> 00:55:46,870
Here's the way I think we should do this.

941
00:55:46,870 --> 00:55:49,630
[This team is trying to decide
how to build their can boat.]

942
00:55:49,630 --> 00:55:55,290
I think we should attach all the cans together
and wrap the whole thing in plastic bags.

943
00:55:55,910 --> 00:55:57,940
We don't have the time to wrap
these up individually.

944
00:55:57,940 --> 00:56:02,420
[Jae Suk's experienced Han river
crossing know-how.]

945
00:56:02,420 --> 00:56:06,320
I don't know if it was because
the bottom portion was too tall or what.

946
00:56:06,330 --> 00:56:09,210
But our boat just flipped over
while we were rowing the boat across.

947
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:14,260
So make the bottom portion small?
So that we don't flip over?

948
00:56:14,260 --> 00:56:19,260
But having a bigger portion of the boat under
the water ensures that we won't flip over.

949
00:56:19,260 --> 00:56:22,880
We have to have a good part of the boat
submerged in order to make it more stable.

950
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:27,610
- To make that submerged part deeper?
- Yes, that gives is more stability.

951
00:56:28,300 --> 00:56:31,990
- There are some cans that are still full.
- Then we'll put those on the bottom.

952
00:56:31,990 --> 00:56:35,390
Once the rest of the boat is built,
we can put a few of these on the bottom.

953
00:56:35,390 --> 00:56:37,820
Having some weight on the bottom
ensures that the boat won't flip over.

954
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:42,000
Being able to go fast is important too,
but we have to be able to float above all.

955
00:56:42,010 --> 00:56:45,730
[Speed is crucial, but being able to float
is first and foremost.]

956
00:56:45,730 --> 00:56:48,000
- I think it'll be easier to build too.
- Doing it this way?

957
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,440
Yes, because it's more stable.

958
00:56:51,420 --> 00:56:56,290
[Chatty Young Taek is practically building
the boat with his talking alone.]

959
00:56:56,290 --> 00:57:00,430
- We can build it wide like this.
- Didn't you say you're good at calculations?

960
00:57:00,430 --> 00:57:05,100
- Excuse me? Yes, I can do that.
- He's good at lip service calculations.

961
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:08,650
This material is so unexpected.

962
00:57:10,130 --> 00:57:12,980
[Meanwhile, Team Kun-Kuk is struggling
with their blankets.]

963
00:57:12,980 --> 00:57:15,790
You with your love for sleep is
what got you those blankets.

964
00:57:15,790 --> 00:57:18,360
Jae Suk, I'm going to try sleeping
on the Han river.

965
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:20,150
Yeah, that sounds good.

966
00:57:22,300 --> 00:57:26,250
[Are they building a boat, or a bed?]

967
00:57:26,250 --> 00:57:29,900
- And lastly, this will go on top.
- Folded in half?

968
00:57:29,900 --> 00:57:31,900
[Briefly shapes the boat...]

969
00:57:31,900 --> 00:57:34,560
[And tape all the blankets together.]

970
00:57:36,910 --> 00:57:40,150
[Will this boat be able to float on water?]

971
00:57:47,020 --> 00:57:50,420
[These three have already become close enough
to start joking around with each other.]

972
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:56,920
[Meanwhile,
there's Team Chung-Ang with their balls.]

973
00:57:58,670 --> 00:58:02,520
We picked a really tedious material.

974
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:05,530
- I'm just glad we didn't get the balloons.
- Me too.

975
00:58:05,530 --> 00:58:08,280
[Even though the balls are a lot of work,
the balloons are even more work.]

976
00:58:08,950 --> 00:58:10,770
No!

977
00:58:12,210 --> 00:58:15,440
[These balls looks so sturdy
compared to the balloons.]

978
00:58:16,590 --> 00:58:20,540
- I think these are going to float well.
- I feel like we're on a science program.

979
00:58:21,770 --> 00:58:29,120
[But in actuality...
it's more of an athletic program?]

980
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:36,420
- Are you recycling right now?
- Can't you see what we're doing?

981
00:58:36,420 --> 00:58:41,410
- Are you organizing your recyclables?
- This boat is going to whiz past yours.

982
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:47,280
Today must be recycling day.

983
00:58:48,370 --> 00:58:51,920
- Keep that up, and I'll include you in it.
- What did you say?

984
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:55,700
Do you want me to tape you along to your cans
and recycle you along with them?

985
00:58:59,250 --> 00:59:01,770
[Bit Na comes to get Kkuk
to stop the two from bickering any further.]

986
00:59:01,770 --> 00:59:03,470
I have to get back to work.

987
00:59:04,510 --> 00:59:07,370
[Takes Kkuk back to their work station
with one simple glare from her eyes.]

988
00:59:10,060 --> 00:59:12,620
[Team Dong-kuk is busy building
their basin boat.]

989
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:15,790
- Let me give it a try.
- This is really hard work.

990
00:59:15,790 --> 00:59:17,410
- It's okay.
- Be careful not to bust it.

991
00:59:17,410 --> 00:59:19,790
This is too tough for a girl.

992
00:59:22,590 --> 00:59:24,810
[She's good.]

993
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:28,530
She's much better than us.

994
00:59:30,100 --> 00:59:32,820
[Musical girl's angry burst of saw action.]

995
00:59:37,810 --> 00:59:42,450
[Even the hammer...
and the drill is no problem!]

996
00:59:45,070 --> 00:59:47,310
[These boys are just her helpers.]

997
00:59:47,310 --> 00:59:52,590
[Musical girl, Sun Min, all of a sudden
is the lead builder of this team.]

998
00:59:54,740 --> 00:59:59,020
[They're picking up the speed
with Sun Min's lead.]

999
00:59:59,030 --> 01:00:01,970
I feel so nervous.
I can't sink again.

1000
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:11,990
[Building the boat with these basins
doesn't seem like easy work.]

1001
01:00:14,630 --> 01:00:16,710
If we sink,
there's nothing we can do about it.

1002
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:25,690
[Cross the Han River...
Their second attempt.]

1003
01:00:26,510 --> 01:00:28,790
[Seven boats built with
seven different materials.]

1004
01:00:30,670 --> 01:00:33,110
[Just which of these boats will succeed?]

1005
01:00:33,110 --> 01:00:36,170
[And which one of these boats
will be the fastest?]

1006
01:00:37,790 --> 01:00:41,190
[Only ten minutes left on the clock.
There's still so much left to do.]

1007
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:44,690
[Recruits another helper to
help them finish building their boat.]

1008
01:00:44,690 --> 01:00:47,400
[The balloon boat is starting to take shape.]

1009
01:00:51,560 --> 01:00:53,020
- Is it okay?
- Not bad.

1010
01:00:53,020 --> 01:00:55,650
Yeah, it's okay.
I think this is going to be okay.

1011
01:00:58,620 --> 01:01:07,070
[Attach all the balloons together lengthwise...
to make it the same length of the boat.]

1012
01:01:07,730 --> 01:01:10,190
If we fall in the water, let's get all
these balloons out and have a party.

1013
01:01:10,260 --> 01:01:12,980
[Chan Yi's graduation balloon party?]

1014
01:01:13,650 --> 01:01:15,450
She's really good.

1015
01:01:17,730 --> 01:01:21,210
[Blank Ji's speedy taping job leaves
the male students' jaws dropped in awe.]

1016
01:01:21,210 --> 01:01:23,420
How is she so good?

1017
01:01:23,420 --> 01:01:28,550
[Even the blanket boat is
getting close to completion.]

1018
01:01:28,550 --> 01:01:30,150
That looks good.

1019
01:01:30,150 --> 01:01:34,250
- Where are you from?
- I'm from Running Man Moving Center.

1020
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:39,930
[A boat made out of blankets...
will it float on water?]

1021
01:01:39,930 --> 01:01:41,830
That blanket boat is pretty good.

1022
01:01:43,100 --> 01:01:47,090
[Team Korea's can boat is nearing
its completion as well.]

1023
01:01:49,120 --> 01:01:53,310
Three people can fit on this, right?
Let me try and see how we fit.

1024
01:01:53,310 --> 01:01:56,410
[In case they crush the cans,
he only imitates sitting down on it.]

1025
01:01:56,410 --> 01:01:57,920
I think it's going to work.

1026
01:01:57,920 --> 01:02:00,410
[Always positive thinking Young Taek.]

1027
01:02:00,420 --> 01:02:02,170
You're so positive.

1028
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:06,180
Okay, we're good.
Let's wrap it up.

1029
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:10,210
[Final wrapping job
is all they have left to do.]

1030
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:18,170
[Wrap it... and wrap it some more.]

1031
01:02:18,950 --> 01:02:23,310
[Wrapping it up without leaving
any room for any water to leak in.]

1032
01:02:25,290 --> 01:02:28,390
[Even puts some cute
decorative finishing touches.]

1033
01:02:30,490 --> 01:02:32,860
[Smile]

1034
01:02:34,860 --> 01:02:36,980
I hope this doesn't sink.

1035
01:02:38,580 --> 01:02:40,300
I don't know how this is going to do.

1036
01:02:41,930 --> 01:02:44,190
The only thing left for us to do
is finish this race in first place.

1037
01:02:44,190 --> 01:02:48,830
I want you both to go back to your school with
the scholarship and a smile on your faces.

1038
01:02:48,830 --> 01:02:51,050
[We hope that Young Taek doesn't lose that
self-assured confidence of his on the water.]

1039
01:02:54,650 --> 01:02:58,440
[The plastic boat is barely starting
to take shape of a boat.]

1040
01:02:58,440 --> 01:03:00,180
This is better than
I thought it was going to be.

1041
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:02,850
Can we just roll it around?

1042
01:03:06,020 --> 01:03:09,940
[Thanks to her brilliant idea,
they're able to do the wrap job quickly.]

1043
01:03:09,940 --> 01:03:12,810
You want to make a handle?

1044
01:03:12,820 --> 01:03:14,300
[Even making a handle for the boat?]

1045
01:03:15,220 --> 01:03:18,630
['Ye- Sisters', Ye Na and Ye Ji,
showing amazing teamwork skills.]

1046
01:03:24,500 --> 01:03:27,570
[Even a cute smiley face
to finish off the boat.]

1047
01:03:28,230 --> 01:03:30,040
Do you think that's going to float?

1048
01:03:30,040 --> 01:03:32,150
Of course, it'll float.
Why wouldn't it float?

1049
01:03:32,890 --> 01:03:36,040
- You made this with just plastic bags?
- Yes.

1050
01:03:36,040 --> 01:03:39,110
[100% plastic bag boat.]

1051
01:03:40,850 --> 01:03:44,540
[How long will the air in the plastic bags
hold out for them?]

1052
01:03:44,540 --> 01:03:46,150
I think we'll be okay.

1053
01:03:49,850 --> 01:03:54,820
[Team Dong-kuk is putting the final touches
to their boat too.]

1054
01:03:57,390 --> 01:04:02,580
We didn't have enough time, so we didn't
get to finish making our side floats.

1055
01:04:02,580 --> 01:04:04,000
[Unable to finish building as planned
due to the lack of time.]

1056
01:04:06,160 --> 01:04:10,500
[But they're still doing their absolute best
to finish building as best as they can.]

1057
01:04:12,660 --> 01:04:15,510
[The basin boat is now complete!]

1058
01:04:16,210 --> 01:04:19,370
- We have to wrap it all together.
- Saran wrap or tape?

1059
01:04:19,370 --> 01:04:21,300
We have to use saran wrap.

1060
01:04:21,300 --> 01:04:25,980
[Team Chung-Ang just needs to finish
wrapping up their boat.]

1061
01:04:31,170 --> 01:04:32,800
It's pretty bouncy.

1062
01:04:33,410 --> 01:04:35,690
We're going to win and
you're going to win the scholarship.

1063
01:04:35,690 --> 01:04:37,810
How about splitting the scholarship
three ways?

1064
01:04:39,190 --> 01:04:41,490
Okay, fine.
You know I wouldn't do that.

1065
01:04:41,490 --> 01:04:43,160
<i>Yes, he would do that.</i>

1066
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:46,530
I'm sure you'll get a phone call from him
a couple days after the show.

1067
01:04:47,460 --> 01:04:49,660
I'll send you my bank deposit number.

1068
01:04:50,670 --> 01:04:54,010
[The water bottle boat is nearing
its completion as well.]

1069
01:04:54,010 --> 01:04:56,690
- Is it finished?
- Let is down gently.

1070
01:04:56,690 --> 01:04:58,250
Gently.

1071
01:04:58,250 --> 01:05:00,650
We're done!

1072
01:05:01,300 --> 01:05:03,080
We built this whole thing
with plastic bottles.

1073
01:05:03,080 --> 01:05:06,150
[From water bottle boat to plastic bag boat-
All seven boats are now complete.]

1074
01:05:07,790 --> 01:05:13,900
[Lift up the boats that they had built...
and off to Han river they go.]

1075
01:05:13,900 --> 01:05:16,750
- I hope we don't sink.
- We're not going to sink.

1076
01:05:16,760 --> 01:05:19,220
[Seven boats all made from
seven different materials.]

1077
01:05:19,230 --> 01:05:21,020
We can't drop it.

1078
01:05:21,020 --> 01:05:25,080
[Will they be able to cross the river safely?]

1079
01:05:28,040 --> 01:05:30,390
[On their way to Han river.]

1080
01:05:30,390 --> 01:05:34,700
You know how the students build their own sets
when they put on plays in theater class?

1081
01:05:34,700 --> 01:05:37,150
She was able to do everything
on her own.

1082
01:05:37,150 --> 01:05:41,030
She did the hammering and the sawing herself.
I was so shocked when I saw that.

1083
01:05:41,080 --> 01:05:44,380
We have what's called 'Theater Set Building'
class in school.

1084
01:05:44,380 --> 01:05:48,880
We learn how to hammer things,
and build stairs and bookcases.

1085
01:05:49,430 --> 01:05:51,540
Do you want to see
my girl teammate's hand?

1086
01:05:59,310 --> 01:06:02,530
[Bit Na has no ounce of shyness
about her.]

1087
01:06:04,020 --> 01:06:06,670
- I had a great time today.
- Me too, Gary.

1088
01:06:07,640 --> 01:06:09,790
Even better times are waiting
for us ahead.

1089
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:13,420
The question is, whether that blanket boat
is going to float or not.

1090
01:06:13,430 --> 01:06:15,880
- Will that boat float?
- I guarantee that the blanket will float.

1091
01:06:15,880 --> 01:06:17,520
That blanket boat looked really nice.

1092
01:06:17,530 --> 01:06:19,660
As for Ye Na and Ye Ji...

1093
01:06:19,660 --> 01:06:21,650
you should just study hard at school
and win your own scholarships.

1094
01:06:21,650 --> 01:06:23,880
[The plastic bag girls will just have to
earn their scholarships on their own.]

1095
01:06:23,880 --> 01:06:27,020
- You should just work hard.
- I think we're here.

1096
01:06:27,020 --> 01:06:30,020
[A round of applause for everyone
and for the hard work they've put in.]

1097
01:06:34,500 --> 01:06:36,550
I'm starting to feel nervous.

1098
01:06:38,950 --> 01:06:41,730
[Finally arrives at Han river.]

1099
01:06:43,420 --> 01:06:47,610
[What nice weather for a boat ride.]

1100
01:06:50,590 --> 01:06:53,720
[Team Korea approaches the water with
their can boat held high above their heads.]

1101
01:06:53,720 --> 01:06:57,590
Here we are again.

1102
01:07:04,280 --> 01:07:06,280
You know where you have to go, right?
The fountain you see on the other side...

1103
01:07:06,280 --> 01:07:09,260
I know that.
How can I forget about this place?

1104
01:07:11,260 --> 01:07:12,830
Put your boat down on the ground.

1105
01:07:14,820 --> 01:07:17,770
To keep everyone safe,
please put on your life jackets.

1106
01:07:18,330 --> 01:07:20,080
Can we start from that side over there?

1107
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:23,270
From where?
Sure, you can do that if you'd like.

1108
01:07:23,270 --> 01:07:26,790
The reason being, this is the spot
where we got started the last time.

1109
01:07:29,160 --> 01:07:34,240
[That day's trauma is still fresh in his mind
now that he's back on the banks of Han river.]

1110
01:07:39,510 --> 01:07:46,200
[All the other teams are arriving one by one
with their own respective boats.]

1111
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:49,820
Do you think that other people would even
guess that this is made out of blankets?

1112
01:07:50,830 --> 01:07:54,650
I bet you can carry this by yourself.
What if we get swept down by the current?

1113
01:07:54,650 --> 01:07:59,930
[They're already worried about being swept
down the river before the race even starts.]

1114
01:08:04,320 --> 01:08:05,880
- Are you alright?
- Be careful.

1115
01:08:06,600 --> 01:08:08,410
I'm fine.

1116
01:08:08,410 --> 01:08:10,210
Watch your step, okay?

1117
01:08:12,140 --> 01:08:18,440
[All seven boats are now gathered
together at the starting line.]

1118
01:08:20,650 --> 01:08:27,200
[All the teams are busy practicing
how to row their boats.]

1119
01:08:27,990 --> 01:08:30,910
<i>Kim Jong Kook and Chung-Ang University.</i>

1120
01:08:33,010 --> 01:08:36,360
<i>Ji Suk Jin and Kyung Hee University.</i>

1121
01:08:38,040 --> 01:08:40,840
<i>Ha Ha and Dong-Guk University.</i>

1122
01:08:41,760 --> 01:08:44,980
<i>Lee Kwang Soo and Seo-Gang University.</i>

1123
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:49,110
<i>Song Ji Hyo and Kun-Kuk University.</i>

1124
01:08:52,550 --> 01:08:55,710
<i>Gary and Seong-Shin University.</i>

1125
01:08:56,760 --> 01:09:00,040
<i>Yoo Jae Suk and Korea University.</i>

1126
01:09:00,040 --> 01:09:02,570
This is how I fell in the water
the last time.

1127
01:09:09,240 --> 01:09:12,540
[At last...
it's time to head out into the water.]

1128
01:09:15,980 --> 01:09:22,350
[With the boats that they made themselves...
they have to cross Han river.]

1129
01:09:22,360 --> 01:09:28,180
Everyone must cross to the other side.
Everyone rally up and we'll get started.

1130
01:09:29,270 --> 01:09:33,600
[Even though this looks to be
an impossible challenge...]

1131
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:38,420
[It's the passion of these youths
that may get the job done.]

1132
01:09:44,270 --> 01:09:48,510
[But will all these boats float on water?]

1133
01:09:48,510 --> 01:09:50,440
Are you all ready?

1134
01:09:55,080 --> 01:09:58,210
We're sinking!
I think we're going to sink!

1135
01:09:58,210 --> 01:09:59,650
[The balloon boat is in danger of sinking
right off the bat?]

1136
01:10:00,540 --> 01:10:04,750
[On the other hand,
the bottle boat seems quite sturdy.]

1137
01:10:05,980 --> 01:10:09,970
[Safety first!
The rescue boat stays nearby.]

1138
01:10:11,750 --> 01:10:14,660
[They're about to start.]

1139
01:10:19,220 --> 01:10:21,720
[Even though they all just met
for the first time today...]

1140
01:10:21,720 --> 01:10:26,710
[They've somehow all become comrades
with the same goal and mission.]

1141
01:10:26,710 --> 01:10:30,670
We wish you all a safe journey
across the river.

1142
01:10:30,670 --> 01:10:33,360
- Ready!
- Fighting!

1143
01:10:43,790 --> 01:10:48,860
[Half trepidation, and half excitement-
Off they go with their passionate hearts!]

1144
01:10:48,860 --> 01:10:55,190
[Off to the Han river without
any hesitation.]

1145
01:11:16,460 --> 01:11:19,960
[Wow! All the boats are afloat!]

1146
01:11:19,960 --> 01:11:24,870
[But none of the boats
are really moving forward!]

1147
01:11:35,870 --> 01:11:37,610
Don't bump into us.

1148
01:11:40,480 --> 01:11:44,660
[Not easy to find their direction.]

1149
01:11:44,660 --> 01:11:50,380
[The bottle boat, ball boat, and basin boat
are all just spinning in place.]

1150
01:11:54,030 --> 01:12:01,560
[On the other hand, the other four boats
are gliding off towards their finish line.]

1151
01:12:09,970 --> 01:12:18,010
[Not only that...
but the blanket boat is in the lead!]

1152
01:12:20,480 --> 01:12:26,270
[And the weakest plastic bag boat
is in second place.]

1153
01:12:27,150 --> 01:12:30,030
[The fact that they're even
afloat is amazing enough...]

1154
01:12:33,160 --> 01:12:37,090
[Even the balloon boat is starting
to pull ahead.]

1155
01:12:39,830 --> 01:12:43,900
[Jae Suk and Team Korea are starting to
pull ahead on their can boat.]

1156
01:12:46,170 --> 01:12:50,800
[They're all starting to get on their way!]

1157
01:12:51,250 --> 01:12:58,900
[Current Rankings]

1158
01:13:02,060 --> 01:13:03,540
We can do it!

1159
01:13:03,540 --> 01:13:06,310
- What's our goal?
- To win!

1160
01:13:06,320 --> 01:13:08,430
- What did you say!
- To win!

1161
01:13:10,300 --> 01:13:15,860
[Their goal is to win...
but their boat isn't moving.]

1162
01:13:16,620 --> 01:13:19,420
[What's going on here?]

1163
01:13:20,990 --> 01:13:24,480
[Their boat definitely is made
with the best of the best material.]

1164
01:13:24,480 --> 01:13:28,200
[So why isn't their boat even moving?]

1165
01:13:31,190 --> 01:13:34,690
[Even the ball boat
is just spinning in its place.]

1166
01:13:41,420 --> 01:13:45,320
[Even the boat made with second best material,
the basin boat, isn't moving very far.]

1167
01:13:49,980 --> 01:13:54,380
[The back portion of their boat is starting to
sink lower and lower into the water.]

1168
01:13:58,830 --> 01:14:03,400
- We have to cross the finish line.
- One, two!

1169
01:14:03,400 --> 01:14:11,490
[They're putting everything they have
into rowing their boat across...]

1170
01:14:11,500 --> 01:14:14,800
[But the boat isn't moving from its place.]

1171
01:14:23,430 --> 01:14:26,160
[These two are aggressively
taking the lead.]

1172
01:14:27,930 --> 01:14:32,050
[Plastic bag boat,
with the worst material of the lot.]

1173
01:14:32,050 --> 01:14:36,240
[And with the most number of girls
on the team...]

1174
01:14:36,250 --> 01:14:40,020
[But they're pulling strongly
as second in lead.]

1175
01:14:44,530 --> 01:14:46,220
You're doing great!

1176
01:14:46,220 --> 01:14:49,070
I'm not even cold!
I'm actually hot!

1177
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:55,190
[Could this be these girls'
hidden superpower?]

1178
01:15:02,120 --> 01:15:05,730
[They're fast!]

1179
01:15:08,620 --> 01:15:13,020
[No one could've even guessed that these
two worst teams could be in the lead!]

1180
01:15:17,610 --> 01:15:22,040
[Taking the time to check the finish line.]

1181
01:15:22,040 --> 01:15:25,460
[And the blanket boat is off again!]

1182
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:30,870
[And the balloon boat
is closely on their tail!]

1183
01:15:34,100 --> 01:15:36,170
[Some balloons floating by on the water.]

1184
01:15:36,170 --> 01:15:38,340
That's our crown!

1185
01:15:38,340 --> 01:15:40,220
Bye!

1186
01:15:47,010 --> 01:15:49,160
Why are our balloons starting
to shrink?

1187
01:15:50,440 --> 01:15:53,470
[Will their balloons
get them to the finish line?]

1188
01:15:53,480 --> 01:15:58,380
[They must hurry before all the air
escapes from their balloons.]

1189
01:16:06,370 --> 01:16:09,330
[However...]

1190
01:16:09,330 --> 01:16:12,110
[Team Korea is right on their tail!]

1191
01:16:12,110 --> 01:16:15,010
[Still catching up to them even with
their feet submerged in the water.]

1192
01:16:17,190 --> 01:16:20,640
[They may catch up to them
at any moment!]

1193
01:16:32,220 --> 01:16:36,270
[The can boat is right on their tail.]

1194
01:16:38,850 --> 01:16:46,310
[Even the chatty Jae Suk and Young Taek
are just rowing without any talking...]

1195
01:16:46,310 --> 01:16:49,950
[Will they catch up to the others?]

1196
01:16:51,990 --> 01:16:53,990
[Meanwhile...]

1197
01:16:55,310 --> 01:16:58,690
[The blanket boat is still in the lead.]

1198
01:17:01,510 --> 01:17:04,340
[Amazing teamwork!]

1199
01:17:06,390 --> 01:17:09,140
We just crossed the Han river on
a stack of blankets!

1200
01:17:10,670 --> 01:17:13,130
[We crossed the Han river on blankets!]

1201
01:17:13,130 --> 01:17:14,920
We can do it!

1202
01:17:14,920 --> 01:17:21,150
<i>Blankets! Blankets!</i>

1203
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:26,110
[A world record!
Crossing the Han river on blankets.]

1204
01:17:28,200 --> 01:17:31,230
[Feeling totally at ease.]

1205
01:17:37,710 --> 01:17:46,020
[Almost to the finish line-
And these three are giving it their best.]

1206
01:17:57,340 --> 01:18:00,470
[A huge gap in their lead.]

1207
01:18:09,590 --> 01:18:13,650
[To cross the Han river on some blankets...]

1208
01:18:14,250 --> 01:18:17,570
[Still unable to believe what we're seeing.]

1209
01:18:18,110 --> 01:18:21,110
[Even their record is hard to believe.]

1210
01:18:22,320 --> 01:18:24,390
His socks are all soaked.

1211
01:18:29,570 --> 01:18:34,920
[These two men's passion shining
all the way through to the end.]

1212
01:18:43,180 --> 01:18:45,980
[Ji Hyo and Team Kun-Kuk
arrive in first place.]

1213
01:18:49,300 --> 01:18:55,220
[Taking their precious blanket boat
with the help of one another...]

1214
01:18:57,280 --> 01:19:01,260
[Heads towards the victory flag
with an ease in their steps.]

1215
01:19:04,940 --> 01:19:07,780
This should've been
a documentary of some sorts.

1216
01:19:11,870 --> 01:19:15,200
[Ji Hyo and Team Kun-Kuk wins.]

1217
01:19:15,200 --> 01:19:18,840
- Kun-Kuk University, fighting!
- Fighting!

1218
01:19:18,840 --> 01:19:21,020
[Kun-Kuk University and Song Ji Hyo!]

1219
01:19:21,020 --> 01:19:22,330
We won!

1220
01:19:22,330 --> 01:19:27,690
We're going to float that blanket boat
in the university's pond in commemoration.

1221
01:19:27,690 --> 01:19:28,980
[In the university's pond?]

1222
01:19:28,980 --> 01:19:32,970
Please allow the students to be able to ride
the blanket boat for exercise purposes!

1223
01:19:32,970 --> 01:19:35,060
- Fighting!
- Fighting!

1224
01:19:38,730 --> 01:19:42,080
[Gary and Team Seong-Shin are almost
to the finish line as well.]

1225
01:19:47,300 --> 01:19:50,000
Don't stop!
We can't stop now!

1226
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:51,910
[Brother Gae is giving encouragement
to the two younger girls.]

1227
01:19:51,910 --> 01:19:54,190
We're almost there!
Another 100m!

1228
01:20:05,080 --> 01:20:07,030
Talking is going to exhaust you even more.
Just row!

1229
01:20:09,630 --> 01:20:11,500
Seong-Shin University, fighting!

1230
01:20:16,380 --> 01:20:21,670
[Screaming along
with their final burst of energy.]

1231
01:20:29,920 --> 01:20:32,760
The two teams that were in last place are
the only ones at the finish line right now.

1232
01:20:33,100 --> 01:20:35,770
The two teams with the worst selections are
the only ones at the finish line right now.

1233
01:20:35,770 --> 01:20:40,360
- Kang Gary, fighting!
- Seong-Shin University, fighting!

1234
01:20:40,360 --> 01:20:42,590
[With the worst plastic bag material...]

1235
01:20:42,590 --> 01:20:46,020
[And with two girls on their team...]

1236
01:20:46,020 --> 01:20:49,420
[They finish in second place!]

1237
01:20:53,470 --> 01:20:55,480
You're almost at the finish line!
Just a little bit more!

1238
01:20:55,480 --> 01:20:59,690
Come on, soldiers!
Row! there you go!

1239
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:02,380
We did it!

1240
01:21:02,930 --> 01:21:04,620
We did it!

1241
01:21:04,620 --> 01:21:06,780
We did it.
We actually did it!

1242
01:21:06,780 --> 01:21:10,450
[Gary and Team Seong-Shin
finishes in second place.]

1243
01:21:15,510 --> 01:21:19,810
[The agony comes to find them
the moment they get off the boat.]

1244
01:21:19,820 --> 01:21:23,070
[You can handle the pain.
You came in at second place!]

1245
01:21:27,390 --> 01:21:30,090
Come here!
Come here, my soldiers!

1246
01:21:30,100 --> 01:21:32,990
[A hug of joy with his teammates.]

1247
01:21:32,990 --> 01:21:34,650
You both did great.

1248
01:21:35,530 --> 01:21:40,540
Because of all your hard work, we'll give out
scholarships down to third place winners.

1249
01:21:42,640 --> 01:21:46,560
[Congratulations on winning the scholarship!
Time for another hug!]

1250
01:21:46,560 --> 01:21:49,260
The two teams with the worst materials
came in at first and second place.

1251
01:21:49,260 --> 01:21:52,430
- You all did great!
- Yay!

1252
01:21:57,230 --> 01:21:59,980
I never would've guessed that the blankets
and the plastic bags would even succeed!

1253
01:21:59,980 --> 01:22:01,900
But we did it!

1254
01:22:04,370 --> 01:22:08,440
[But...]

1255
01:22:08,450 --> 01:22:13,810
[The competition isn't over yet.]

1256
01:22:14,660 --> 01:22:18,930
[The battle for third place
is starting to heat up even more.]

1257
01:22:20,110 --> 01:22:22,920
[And...]

1258
01:22:22,930 --> 01:22:31,750
[These three teams still aren't moving,
but they're all still giving it their best.]

1259
01:22:35,360 --> 01:22:38,080
[The gap is closing in even more.]

1260
01:22:38,790 --> 01:22:41,020
They might catch up to them.

1261
01:22:43,410 --> 01:22:48,910
[The can boat is right on
the balloon boat's tail.]

1262
01:22:50,110 --> 01:22:53,040
[They're about to catch up to them!]

1263
01:22:57,050 --> 01:22:59,160
They're really catching up to us!

1264
01:23:00,750 --> 01:23:04,480
[Those two boats are neck and neck!]

1265
01:23:17,010 --> 01:23:18,230
No!

1266
01:23:22,810 --> 01:23:26,150
[They've surpassed the balloon boat!
Jae Suk and Team Korea are in third place!]

1267
01:23:31,910 --> 01:23:35,960
[The team that gets to the finish flag first
will be declared third place winners!]

1268
01:23:35,960 --> 01:23:41,000
[The scholarship will be given out to
the third place winners as well.]

1269
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:44,420
Down to the third place winners!

1270
01:23:47,340 --> 01:23:50,580
[Jae Suk and Team Korea are almost
to the finish line!]

1271
01:23:51,240 --> 01:23:52,820
[Just then...]

1272
01:24:02,140 --> 01:24:05,490
[Desperate Giraffe
throws himself in the water.]

1273
01:24:21,440 --> 01:24:25,720
[All three members of the team must
pull the flag out together for it to count.]

1274
01:24:25,720 --> 01:24:28,670
All three members have to pull
the flag out together.

1275
01:24:31,590 --> 01:24:33,740
All three members must be together.

1276
01:24:38,480 --> 01:24:40,260
No!

1277
01:24:41,330 --> 01:24:44,780
[Jae Suk and Team Korea wins third place.]

1278
01:24:47,260 --> 01:24:49,390
I'm so cold!
So cold!

1279
01:24:57,040 --> 01:25:00,230
[Team Seo-Gang comes in at fourth place.]

1280
01:25:17,480 --> 01:25:20,190
This is amazing.
Did you start to sweat towards the end?

1281
01:25:20,190 --> 01:25:22,070
Yes, I got so hot that I just
wanted to jump in the water.

1282
01:25:24,700 --> 01:25:27,650
Fighting!

1283
01:25:29,860 --> 01:25:32,460
[Even though winning
may have been their goal...]

1284
01:25:32,460 --> 01:25:37,040
[That has no place in their ultimate goal
of crossing the finishing line.]

1285
01:25:37,040 --> 01:25:40,880
[Right in this moment, everyone is a winner.]

1286
01:25:45,990 --> 01:25:47,860
You're almost at the finish line,
Dong Hoon!

1287
01:25:47,860 --> 01:25:50,190
Fighting!

1288
01:25:54,450 --> 01:25:59,010
[One voice and one heart-
Cheering them on to the very end.]

1289
01:26:02,810 --> 01:26:07,440
Ji Suk Jin!

1290
01:26:07,440 --> 01:26:16,210
[And the beautiful last place holders...
getting the hottest cheer of them all.]

1291
01:26:17,210 --> 01:26:19,870
[Giraffe is in the mood and
is attempting to ride the wave.]

1292
01:26:19,870 --> 01:26:22,760
[But he's criticized immediately.]

1293
01:26:23,330 --> 01:26:25,470
Hurry, Suk Jin!
I'm cold!

1294
01:26:31,200 --> 01:26:36,160
Ji Suk Jin!

1295
01:26:41,690 --> 01:26:47,580
[The final team crosses the finish line
in the midst of their enthusiastic cheer.]

1296
01:26:48,850 --> 01:26:52,160
[A huge round of applause for finishing
the race without ever giving up.]

1297
01:26:53,130 --> 01:26:56,640
[All seven teams complete the race.]

1298
01:27:02,440 --> 01:27:05,930
Thank you to all the students,
and the Running Man members.

1299
01:27:06,570 --> 01:27:12,260
Every single one of the seven teams
succeeded in completing the race.

1300
01:27:12,260 --> 01:27:13,750
[All seven teams completed the race!]

1301
01:27:17,890 --> 01:27:19,590
The blanket boat was amazing.

1302
01:27:21,470 --> 01:27:24,100
Every single plastic bag
could make a huge difference!

1303
01:27:27,020 --> 01:27:31,200
The two teams with the worst material
selection came in at first and second place.

1304
01:27:31,200 --> 01:27:33,940
That's what life is like.

1305
01:27:41,910 --> 01:27:47,520
[Scholarship is passed out to
Kun-Kuk University winners.]

1306
01:27:52,790 --> 01:27:57,090
[Ji Hyo and her team break the record
with 16 minutes and 47 seconds.]

1307
01:27:58,010 --> 01:28:00,920
[A word from the winning team.]

1308
01:28:01,790 --> 01:28:04,290
[Even though they started off with a
huge disadvantage in sixth place...]

1309
01:28:04,290 --> 01:28:06,530
[But that spurred them on to work even harder
and thus were able to come in at first place.]

1310
01:28:06,530 --> 01:28:11,790
This has taught me that hard work will always
make me a winner in whatever I do.

1311
01:28:11,790 --> 01:28:14,050
[Hard work can make anything possible!]

1312
01:28:15,840 --> 01:28:19,330
We started off in third place,
and we finished in third place.

1313
01:28:21,690 --> 01:28:24,130
I think studying is easier than this.

1314
01:28:24,130 --> 01:28:26,570
No way!

1315
01:28:26,570 --> 01:28:28,340
How can you say that studying
is easy?

1316
01:28:28,340 --> 01:28:30,320
[Gary can't understand her logic.]

1317
01:28:33,760 --> 01:28:36,210
[And lastly, a word from their eldest.]

1318
01:28:36,210 --> 01:28:38,110
You think you're in first place,
but you're actually in last place.

1319
01:28:38,120 --> 01:28:40,180
And you think you're in last place,
but you're actually a winner.

1320
01:28:40,180 --> 01:28:43,680
You can always catch up and win in life.
Fighting!

1321
01:28:46,500 --> 01:28:48,800
[Thank you to all the university students
who graciously participated in our episode.]

1322
01:28:51,780 --> 01:28:55,110
[Here's to all the passionate youths and
to their brand new beginnings.]
